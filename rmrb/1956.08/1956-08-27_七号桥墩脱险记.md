The Rescue of Pier Seven
By our reporter Cao Baoming

Pier Seven of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is located in the main current of the Yangtze River, where the water is deepest and the flow is swiftest. Therefore, it was built particularly high and large, and the construction method was different from the other seven piers. The other piers only needed to sink about thirty large caisson piles, but this one required driving one hundred and sixteen slender pipe piles into the bedrock at the bottom of the river. Construction here encountered difficulties from the start. Some pipe piles would break upon hitting hard bedrock, and after breaking, they had to be pulled out before they could be driven again. The steel sheet piles were also swept by the rapids and could not be inserted into a fixed position, delaying the project's progress by more than a month.

This year's flood arrived almost a month earlier. From May 5th, the water level rose in a straight line, reaching 24 meters above the datum by late May, more than one meter higher than the water level during the same period in 1954. The rapidly rising flood pounded Pier Seven day and night. The pipe piles of Pier Seven, penetrating nearly forty meters of deep water, were violently shaken. Soviet experts calculated: "When the river rises to 26 meters above the datum, with a flow rate of three meters per second, if Pier Seven has not yet had its underwater concrete base sealed, there is a risk of danger at any time." If Pier Seven encountered danger, it would not only affect the early opening of the bridge but also be difficult to complete in a short period.

At the time, the entire bureau was urgently mobilized. The bureau chief personally monitored the daily progress of Pier Seven's construction. Three Soviet experts and the bridge team's deputy chief engineer took turns on duty at Pier Seven day and night. They also adopted emergency measures to reinforce the walings and pipe piles and solved the problem of driving the pipe piles into the bedrock. The steel sheet piles were also inserted smoothly.

		Encountering Danger

On June 14th, the cofferdam of Pier Seven only needed a few more sets of steel sheet piles to be closed.

On this day, there was no rain, no wind, and mountain-like floating clouds occasionally obscured the sunlight illuminating the muddy river. The river was still rising continuously. The two work teams led by Xu Linshan and Sun Jiayan, responsible for inserting steel sheet piles on the left and right sides respectively, were secretly putting in effort, competing to see who could insert them faster and better. Deputy Chief Engineer Yin Wanshou, who was on duty on the pier, saw that the work was progressing smoothly and retreated to the duty room – a small hut on the pier – to write the next construction organization plan.

Around ten o'clock in the morning, the workers of Xu Linshan's work team saw that the steel sheet piles on the right side were only one set away from closing, and couldn't help speeding up their work to catch up. Just as they were lifting a steel sheet pile to insert it, there was a sudden loud noise, and more than forty sets of installed steel sheet piles and over a hundred tons of steel walings were shaking violently. Then they heard the foreman shouting: "Something's wrong, the flood has broken the steel sheet piles!" Deputy Chief Engineer Yin rushed out of the hut upon hearing the sound and saw that the flood had opened a gap at the closing point on the right side, and the steel sheet piles, interlocked with each other, were tilting outwards like a fence being pulled open. Instantly, a dark thought flashed through people's minds: "Pier Seven is damaged, the bridge won't be able to open early!" Who had ever seen steel sheet piles seven or eight stories high being broken by the rapids? Deputy Chief Engineer Yin and many workers were stunned by this unexpected event, unable to think of anything, just retreating to the pontoon boat and staring in a daze at the gap opened by the flood.

A torrent formed in front of Pier Seven, still crashing against the collapsed steel sheet piles, and splashing muddy waves around, threatening to collapse the remaining steel sheet piles. At this moment, Foreman Xu Zhonglu and Team Leader Xu Linshan demonstrated great resourcefulness. They led their team members to risk climbing onto the tops of those steel sheet piles that hadn't collapsed to fasten chain hoist ropes, tying the steel sheet piles to the reinforced pipe pile groups. Sure enough, soon after they were tied, the flood pushed the steel sheet piles again, but fortunately, the chain hoist ropes were tightened, and the steel sheet piles were not further damaged.

The head of the Soviet expert group, Silin, arrived by motorboat. Bureau Chief Peng Min, who had cut his foot a few days earlier, also limped to the scene. After they clarified the situation, Expert Silin immediately said: "It's okay. Quickly pull out the damaged steel sheet piles and insert new ones." Deputy Chief Engineer Yin said: "That won't work, there are no more steel sheet piles." "Yes, there are, Pier Three has them, they don't need them right now."

"Ah!" Deputy Chief Engineer Yin adjusted his thick myopic glasses and thought: "The steel sheet piles for Pier Three were prepared by me there, there are two full boats, how could I not have thought of that?" He immediately issued an order: continue to reinforce the pier and prepare to pull out the steel sheet piles.

	Aerial Rope Release

A total of eight sets of steel sheet piles were damaged, some twisted like fried dough sticks, making them very difficult to pull out. By the time the first set of steel sheet piles was pulled up sixteen or seventeen meters, it was already two or three o'clock in the morning. The myriad lights along the river, like a silver Milky Way, had all been extinguished, the sky was pitch black, and nothing could be seen in the distance, only the roaring of the surging river like ten thousand horses galloping. At this time, another problem arose at the Pier Seven water construction site under the illumination of silver searchlights: the steel sheet piles were thirty-eight meters long, but the boom of the seventy-five-ton crane could only lift seventeen or eighteen meters. The pulled-up steel sheet pile was blocked by the boom, and the chain hoist rope that fastened the boom's hook had to be unfastened so that the hook could hold the lower part and continue to pull it up. But how could they get up to this three or four-story-high space to unfasten the rope? Everyone looked at the high altitude in distress, saying: "What to do? What to do?"

Ai Yunshu, a stevedore with six or seven years of experience who rarely spoke, said to the foreman at this time: "I'll go up." The foreman looked at his short, stocky body and then at the high altitude, and asked: "How will you get up?" "Take the hook of another crane."

After Ai Yunshu ascended into the sky on the crane hook, he immediately put on his safety belt, clamped the groove on the top of the steel sheet pile with his knees, and began to work. Working in mid-air in the dark was difficult enough, but at this time, a small gust of wind blew across the river, and the waves pushed the steel sheet pile back and forth, swinging it three or four meters each time, sometimes hitting the hook, making loud clanging noises. Ai Yunshu swayed back and forth in the air with the steel sheet pile like riding a swing, with the risk of being shaken down at any time. People watching below couldn't help but sweat for him.

Ai Yunshu's knees were hurting badly from being shaken by the steel sheet pile, but he didn't dare to relax even a little. He knew in his heart that at such a moment, if he relaxed his mind even slightly, or looked down at the turbulent waves, he would become dizzy, his limbs would stiffen, and lead to unimaginable consequences. He still concentrated his attention, holding the steel sheet pile firmly with one hand and unfastening the clevis and the chain hoist rope with the other. More than ten minutes passed. The first clevis was unfastened, but the second clevis could not be unfastened, and the chain hoist rope could not be taken down. The foreman anxiously cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted upwards: "Come down quickly—" "There's still one that can't be unfastened." "Loosen one end of the chain hoist rope and let the hook come off." After another while, Ai Yunshu unhooked the hook and grabbed a steel wire rope on the crane, sliding down as nimbly as a monkey.

	Investigating Conditions at the River Bottom

On July 1st, the steel sheet pile cofferdam was about to be closed again. However, the last steel sheet pile was stuck, and after three or four shifts, it still couldn't be inserted. At this time, the meteorological station forecast again: "Strong winds are coming soon."

The winds and waves of the Yangtze River are well-known. Once a strong wind rises, the normally calm surface of the river immediately becomes turbulent, with huge waves like small mountains, which is very dangerous. Many ships had already taken refuge in secluded places beforehand, and the ferries were not operating. If the cofferdam was not closed before the strong wind, the violent winds and waves could open a gap at the closing point, causing a second major accident. It was truly a moment of great anxiety.

The key at this time was to find out the reason why the steel sheet pile couldn't be inserted and take immediate measures. Deputy Chief Engineer Yin's opinion was: the special-shaped steel sheet pile next to it hit the bedrock at the bottom of the river, so it was blocking it from above, making it impossible to insert. Some people thought that there was an obstacle in the water, so it couldn't be inserted. The two sides argued incessantly, a decision could not be made, and a diver had to go down to investigate the situation. But, the water was about forty meters deep, who would let a diver risk their life to go down?

Diver Xu Xianye took the initiative to request to go underwater to understand the situation. Deputy Chief Engineer Yin was still afraid that he would be in danger, and instructed him to only feel around in the middle, see if there were any obstacles, and then come up. He felt around in the middle, and there were no obstacles. Just as he was preparing to surface, a thought suddenly crossed his mind: "The bottom line is that it has not been clarified where the problem lies, and everyone is waiting for the situation!" He went down to the bottom of the river along the steel sheet pile again.

Sinking into the water, for every ten meters sunk, the pressure would increase by one kilogram per square centimeter. When the pressure increased to three and a half kilograms, it would be difficult for the human body to bear. Many newly trained divers, when they went down to sixteen or seventeen meters of deep water for the first time, also experienced dizziness, tinnitus, and nosebleeds, making it difficult to adapt to this change. Although Xu Xianye was a relatively skilled diver with a strong body, when he sank to the forty-meter-deep river bottom, he immediately felt dizzy and his consciousness became somewhat unclear. People on the boat understood how dangerous this was and quickly notified him by telephone to surface quickly. At this time, Xu Xianye rested at the bottom of the water, while still taking care not to let the rapids wash him away, and feeling around with his hands in the dark river bottom where he couldn't see anyone. Finally, he found out that it was indeed the special-shaped steel sheet pile next to it that had been inserted into the bedrock. When he slowly surfaced, the people on the boat were still worried about him: "This is so dangerous!" He replied: "If the steel sheet piles can't be closed, what will happen to Pier Seven?"

Once the situation in the water was clarified, everyone immediately took measures, and the cofferdam was successfully closed.

When the underwater concrete base sealing started on July 8th, although the river water had already risen to 25.9 meters above the datum, only one centimeter away from reaching the most dangerous water level, the workers changed the three concrete pours to one pour, pouring concrete non-stop day and night, and eating by taking turns to buy two steamed buns with some pickles, eating and working at the same time. After four consecutive days and nights of pouring, the foundation of a concrete pier more than twenty meters high stood like a rock in the rapids.

Pier Seven was ahead of the flood and escaped danger!

    七号桥墩脱险记
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉长江大桥的七号桥墩正当长江主流，水最深，流最急，所以它修的特别高大，施工方法也跟其它七个桥墩不同。别的桥墩都只下沉三十根左右的大型管柱，它却要将一百一十六根细长的管桩打到江底岩层里去。在这里施工，一开始就遇到困难，有些管桩遇到坚硬的岩层，打一根断一根，断了还得拔起来才能重打。钢板桩也被激流冲得插不到固定的位置上去，工程进度拉下了一个多月。
    今年的洪水提前了将近一个月来到。从5月5日起，水位就直线上窜，到5月下旬便涨到二十四公尺标高，比1954年同期水位高出一公尺多。急涨的洪水日夜冲击着七号桥墩，七号桥墩的穿过将近四十公尺深水的管桩，都被冲得颤动的非常厉害。苏联专家作了个计算：“江水涨到二十六公尺标高，流速为每秒三公尺时，如果七号桥墩还没有打水下混凝土封底，随时都有发生危险的可能。”要是七号桥墩一出危险，不仅会影响大桥不能提前通车，而且很难在短时期内修成。
    当时，全局都紧急动员起来了。局长亲自掌握七号桥墩工程每天的进度。三个苏联专家和桥队的副总工程师都日夜轮流在七号桥墩上值班。他们又采取紧急措施，加固了围囹和管桩，解决了管桩打入岩层的困难。钢板桩也下插得很顺利。
          遇　险
    6月14日，七号桥墩围堰还插几套钢板桩就合龙了。
    这天，没有雨，也没有风，山峦般的浮云时而遮住了照耀着混浊的江水的阳光。江水还在不断上涨。分别担负左右两边插钢板桩任务的徐林山和孙家言两个工班，都暗地里鼓着一把劲，要比赛谁插得又快又好。在墩上值班的殷万寿副总工程师，见工作很顺利，也退到值班室——墩上的一个小屋里写下一步的施工组织计划去了。
    上午十点多钟，徐林山工班的工人们见右边的钢板桩还差一套就合龙了，不禁加快了手脚，要加把油赶上去。当他们正吊起一块钢板桩要往下插的时候，突然一声巨响，四十多套插好了的钢板桩和百多吨重的钢围囹都在乱晃动，接着就听见领工员在叫：“不好了，洪水把钢板桩冲垮了！”殷副总工程师闻声从小屋里赶了出来，只见洪水在右边合龙处冲开了个缺口，一个个相互扣紧了的钢板桩就像被拉开了的篱笆一样往外倾倒。顿时，一个阴暗的思想从人们心头闪过：“七号桥墩冲坏了，大桥就不能提前通车啦！”谁见过这有七、八层楼高的钢板桩被激流冲垮呢？殷副总工程师和许多工人都被这意外的事件惊蒙了，什么都不能想，也想不到，只是退到囤船上去望着这洪水冲开的缺口出神。
    在七号桥墩前形成了一道激流，仍然哗哗地冲击着倾倒了的一部分钢板桩，又在四周溅起混浊的浪花，眼看洪水还可能将没有倒的钢板桩一起冲垮。这时，徐中鲁领工员和徐林山工长表现了高度的机智，他们率领本班工人冒险攀到那些没有冲垮的钢板桩顶上去拴千斤绳，将钢板桩拴到加固了的管桩群上。果然，刚拴好不久，洪水又将钢板桩冲动了一下，幸亏千斤绳拴紧了，钢板桩才没有被继续冲垮。
    苏联专家组长西林乘着汽艇赶来了。前几天划破了脚的彭敏局长也瘸着腿赶来了。当他们弄清现场情况后，西林专家马上就说：“不要紧。赶快把坏了的钢板桩拔起来，另外再插。”殷副总工程师说：“不行啊，没有钢板桩了。”“有，三号桥墩有，他们现在用不着。”
    “啊！”殷副总工程师扶了扶他那副很深的近视眼镜，想道：“三号桥墩的钢板桩是我在那里准备下的啊，有整整两船，我怎么没想到呢？”他马上发布命令：继续加固墩台，并准备拔钢板桩。
      空中解绳索
    钢板桩一共冲坏了八套，有的竟扭成油条似的了，很难拔。当第一套钢板桩拔起十六七公尺的时候，已是深夜两三点钟了。沿江的银河似的万盏灯火都先后熄灭了，天空一片漆黑，远处什么也看不见，只听见汹涌的江水万马奔腾般的吼声。这时，在银色的探照灯光照耀下的七号桥墩水上工地又出了问题：钢板桩有三十八公尺长，而七十五吨大吊船的扒杆只能吊高十七八公尺，拔起来的钢板桩被扒杆顶住了，必须将捆扒杆钩子的千斤绳卸掉，让钩子再吊住下边的地方继续往上拔。但是，怎么上到这三、四层楼的高空去解绳呢？大家都愁得望着高空直说：“怎么办呢？怎么办呢？”
    平日很少说话的艾耘书，一个干了六、七年的装吊工，这时向工长说：“我上去。”工长望了望他的矮壮的身体，又望望高空，反问道：“怎么上去？”“坐另外一只吊船的吊钩上去。”
    当艾耘书乘着吊钩升到高空以后，他马上挂好安全带，用膝弯夹住钢板桩顶上的槽子，开始工作起来。黑夜里升到半空中工作，已经够困难了，而这时江上又刮起一阵小风，风浪推着钢板桩来回摆动，每次摆三、四公尺远，有时还碰着吊钩，咚呱咚呱直响。艾耘书便像打秋千似的在高空随着钢板桩晃来晃去，随时都有被震下来的危险。在下边望着的人都不禁为他捏了把汗。
    艾耘书的膝弯被钢板震的很痛，但他一点不敢松劲，他心里明白：在这样的时刻，只要精神松弛一下，或者向下面的激浪望望，便会头昏目眩，手脚发僵，招致不可想像的后果。他仍然贯注精神，一手把牢钢板桩，一手去卸卡环，解千斤绳。十几分钟过去了。第一个卡环卸掉了，第二个卡环却怎么也卸不掉，千斤绳也卸不下来。工长这时焦急地两手围在嘴边向上喊道：“赶快下来——”“还有个卸不掉。”“把千斤绳松开一头，让钩子脱掉就行了。”又过了一阵，艾耘书把钩子卸脱后，便抓住吊机上的一根钢丝绳，像猴子一样灵巧地滑下来了。
        江底探实情
      7月1日，钢板桩围堰又该合龙了。但是，最后的一块钢板桩被卡住了，拖了三、四个班也还插不下去。这时，气象台又预报说：“大风很快就要到了。”
    长江的风浪是很著名的。大风一起，平时表面平静的江上立即就波涛翻滚，掀起了小山般的巨浪，十分险恶。许多船只都事前躲到僻静处去了，轮渡也不开航。如果不在大风前将围堰合龙，狂暴的风浪又可能在合龙处冲开缺口，造成第二次重大事故。真令人万分焦急。
    这时的关键是在查明钢板桩插不下去的原因，立即采取措施。殷副总工程师的意见是：旁边的异形钢板桩打到江底岩层了，所以将上边蹩住，插不动。有些人又认为是水中有障碍物，所以插不动。两边的争论相持不下，措施不能决定，必须潜水员下去摸情况。但是，水深约四十公尺，谁能让潜水员下去冒生命危险呢？
    潜水员徐贤业主动要求下水去了解情况。殷副总工程师还怕他出危险，嘱咐他只在中间摸摸，看有没有障碍物就上来。他在中间摸了摸，没有什么障碍物。正准备浮上来，忽然一转念：“倒底是哪里出了问题，还没弄清楚啊，大家都等着要情况呢！”他又沿着钢板桩下沉到江底去了。
      下沉到水中去，每下沉十公尺，每平方公分的面积就要增加一公斤的压力。压力增加到三点五公斤，人的身体就很难忍受。许多新学的潜水员第一次下到十六七公尺的深水中去，也头昏耳鸣，鼻孔出血，很难适应这个变化。尽管徐贤业已是比较熟练的潜水员，身体又很健壮，当他一沉到四十公尺深的江底以后，马上就头晕脑胀，神志有些不清了。船上的人了解这样作有多大危险，连忙用电话通知他赶快浮上来。这时，徐贤业在水底歇了歇，仍然一边注意着不让激流将自己冲跑，一边用手在对面不见人的江底摸来摸去，终于摸清楚确实是旁边的异形钢板桩插到岩层去了。当他慢慢浮出水面后，船上的人还在替他耽心：“这样可危险啦！”他回答说：“钢板桩合不了龙，七号桥墩怎么办？”
    水里情况一摸清楚，大家立即采取措施，围堰就顺利地合龙了。
    到7月8日开始打水下混凝土封底的时候，尽管江水已经涨到二十五点九公尺标高，还差一公寸就达到了最危险的水位，但是，工人们又将三次混凝土改为一次打，日夜不停地往下灌注混凝土，吃饭也是轮流去买两个馒头夹点咸菜回来，边吃边工作。经过四个昼夜连续灌注，一座二十多公尺高的混凝土桥墩基础便像磐石一样屹立在激流里了。
    七号桥墩抢到了洪水前面，脱离了险境！
