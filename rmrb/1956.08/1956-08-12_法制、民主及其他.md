    Rule of Law, Democracy, and Others
    He Qiong
    "The People's Congress system is the fundamental system of our country and the best way to promote work and connect with the masses." Some responsible cadres often say this, and their subordinates often write this, but in practice, they are unwilling to do so.
    Since the promulgation of the Constitution, how many counties and cities across the country have failed to convene meetings of the People's Congress on a regular basis as stipulated by the Organic Law? Only the Ministry of Civil Affairs probably knows the exact figures, but taking Wuhan, one of the largest cities in the country, as an example, the situation is far from satisfactory.
    The Wuhan Municipal People's Congress has not held a single meeting in 1956. The vast majority of municipal districts held only one district People's Congress meeting in 1955. As for most of the rural townships in the suburbs, they have held only four township People's Congress meetings in the two years since the general election. This is clearly far from the requirements of the Organic Law (twice a year for cities and municipal districts, and four times a year for townships).
    Because convening meetings of the People's Congress is regarded as a burden, meetings are often postponed again and again, until they are reluctantly convened when they can no longer be postponed. For example, Wuhan's local financial budget for 1955 was submitted and approved only at the third meeting of the People's Congress held in the second half of November 1955. It was already late in the year, and even the final accounts were about to be prepared. Wouldn't it be a bit ridiculous to have the meeting review the budget at that point?
    "Busy with central work" is the main excuse for not convening meetings of the People's Congress on time, although many responsible comrades often advise people not to oppose convening meetings of the People's Congress to the central work of the Party and the government when writing articles or giving reports. The reason why Wuhan City did not convene a municipal People's Congress meeting in the first half of this year is said to be: the first quarter was due to the high tide of socialist transformation, and the second quarter was due to the high tide of organizing production. Under the premise of serving the central work, labor model representative conferences, women's representative conferences, literacy activist representative conferences, Party representative conferences… and other various types of meetings can be held for three, five, or even several weeks, and the auditorium of the Municipal People's Committee is almost always occupied, but there is simply no time to convene the People's Congress meeting.
    Now, there is increasingly more discussion about the socialist rule of law. This is naturally a very gratifying phenomenon. However, when it comes to the rule of law, people seem to think only of the work of the public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments. In fact, isn't the regular convening of meetings of the People's Congress at all levels also a very important issue of the rule of law? It is the duty of government organs, mass organizations, and every citizen at all levels to seriously abide by, implement, and maintain the law. Failure to fight against illegal phenomena shows that some of us still lack a basic concept of the rule of law.
    "It has only been six years since the founding of the country, and we cannot demand too much or be too hasty on the issue of the rule of law." Very correct. Demanding too much will be divorced from reality. But this is not a question of "high" or "hasty," but rather whether we should arbitrarily discount the existing provisions of the law when implementing it.
    In the people's country, the law is the embodiment of the people's will. Therefore, the socialist rule of law and socialist democracy have an essential and inseparable connection. Any lack of seriousness or respect for the socialist rule of law will inevitably weaken or damage socialist democracy to some extent.
    Someone interjected: "You are talking about 'formal democracy' now. Whether it is democratic or not does not depend on the timing and number of meetings, but on whether people can speak freely and carry out criticism and self-criticism during the meeting."
    That's right, speaking freely at the People's Congress meetings at all levels and fully carrying out criticism and self-criticism is an important part and symbol of our country's democratic life. However, without giving the meeting the necessary time and number of sessions, how can we guarantee that the representatives can "speak freely"? How to carry out criticism and self-criticism?
    Open it if you want to; don't open it if you don't want to. The laws enacted by the National People's Congress can be ignored. This can only be called "doing what you want," how can it be called "the people being the masters of their own affairs"?
    Convening meetings of the People's Congress in a timely manner in accordance with the law is the normal democratic life urgently needed by the people, not "formal democracy." What should be called "formal democracy" is the situation where the financial budget is submitted for approval only near the end of the year.

    法制、民主及其他

    “人民代表大会制度是我们国家的根本制度，是推动工作、联系群众的最好形式”。某些负责干部口中常是这么说，手下也常常这么写，但在实际工作中偏偏不肯这么做。
    自从宪法颁布以来，全国究竟有多少县、市没有按照组织法的规定定期召开人民代表大会会议呢？具体数字大概只有内务部才能说得出来，但就以全国有数的大城市之一——武汉市来说，情况就远不是能够令人满意的。
    武汉市的市人民代表大会会议在1956年还没有开过一次。绝大多数的市辖区，在1955年都只开了一次区人民代表大会会议。至于郊区大多数的乡，从普选到现在两年多的时间内，也不过开了四次乡人民代表大会会议。这与组织法的要求（市及市辖区每年开两次，乡每年开四次），显然是相距很远的。
    由于把召开人民代表大会会议当作负担，因此会议往往是一拖再拖，拖到无法再拖的情况下才勉强召开。举例来说，武汉市1955年的地方财政预算是拖到1955年11月下半月召开的第三次人民代表大会会议上才提出通过的。当时离年终已经不远，连决算也快该动手作了，再让会议来审查预算，岂不令人有些啼笑皆非！
    “中心工作忙，”是不按时召开人民代表大会会议的主要借口，虽然不少负责同志在写文章或作报告时常常劝人不要把召开人民代表大会会议与党和政府的中心工作对立起来。武汉市今年上半年未召开市人民代表大会会议的原因据说就是：第一季度由于社会主义改造高潮，第二季度由于组织生产高潮。在为中心工作服务的前提下，劳模代表大会、妇女代表大会、扫盲积极分子代表大会、党代表大会……等等各形各色的会议可以三天、五天、成周累旬地开，市人民委员会的大礼堂几乎经常不得闲，但就是顾不上召开人民代表大会会议。
    现在，谈论社会主义法制的逐渐多起来了。这自然是极可喜的现象。不过提起法制来，人们似乎总只想到公安、司法、检察部门的工作，其实像定期召开各级人民代表大会会议这件事又何尝不是很重要的法制问题？严肃地遵守、执行和维护法律，是各级政府机关、群众团体和每一公民所应尽的职责。不对违法现象进行斗争，就说明我们有些人还缺乏起码的法制观念。
    “开国不过六周年，在法制问题上，不能要求太高，操之过急”。非常正确。要求太高是会脱离实际的。但这里不是什么“高”和“急”的问题，而是说我们在执行法律已有的规定时，应不应该随便打折扣的问题。
    在人民的国家里，法律是人民意志的体现。因此社会主义法制和社会主义民主就有着本质的、密不可分的联系。对社会主义法制的任何不严肃或不尊重，就不可避免地或多或少地削弱与损害到社会主义的民主。
    有人插嘴说：“你这是在讲‘形式民主’了。民主不民主不在于开会时间和次数，而在于会议中能否畅所欲言，开展批评和自我批评”。
    一点不错，在各级人民代表大会会议上畅所欲言，充分开展批评和自我批评是我国民主生活的一项重要内容和标志。但是，不给会议以必要的时间和次数，如何保证代表们“畅所欲言”？如何开展批评和自我批评呢？
    想开，就开；不想开，就不开。全国人民代表大会制定的法律可以不执行。这只能叫做“自己说了算”，如何能叫做“人民当家作主”呢？
    按照法律规定及时地召开人民代表大会会议，这是人民群众所迫切需要的正常的民主生活，不是“形式民主”。应该被称作“形式民主”的，倒是那快到年终时才提请通过财政预算之类的情况。
