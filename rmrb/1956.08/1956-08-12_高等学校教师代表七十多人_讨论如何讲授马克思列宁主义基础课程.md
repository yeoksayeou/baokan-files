Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The Ministry of Higher Education convened more than seventy representatives of teachers of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism course from universities and colleges across the country from the 6th to the 9th to discuss how to better teach the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism course in universities and colleges.

At the meeting, everyone studied the outline for teaching the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism drafted by the Marxism-Leninism Fundamentals Teaching and Research Section of the Renmin University of China. Everyone believed that the teaching outline focused on key issues and basically reflected the principle of integrating theory with practice. However, specific additions and deletions were also made to the content of certain topics in the outline; and it was believed that the outline did not adequately reflect the revolutionary construction experience of people's democratic countries and the historical experience of the workers' movement in capitalist and colonial and semi-colonial countries, and this aspect should be enriched in teaching practice. In the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that it is necessary to vigorously overcome dogmatic habits and advocate creative research on theory. At the meeting, regarding the question of whether a hundred schools of thought should be allowed to contend in the teaching content of political theory courses, some people believed that contention should only be allowed within the teaching and research section, but not in the classroom. After discussion, the majority believed that teachers should be allowed to express different opinions when lecturing.

In order to promote students' independent thinking and independent research, and appropriately reduce students' classroom burden, the discussion held that the class hours for teaching the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism to departments such as literature, history, philosophy, politics and law, and finance and economics should be reduced to 102 class hours; and the class hours for departments such as science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine should be reduced to 68 class hours; and all types of schools should be allowed greater flexibility in implementation according to specific conditions.

    高等学校教师代表七十多人
    讨论如何讲授马克思列宁主义基础课程
    据新华社10日讯　六日到九日，高等教育部召集了全国各地高等学校马克思列宁主义基础课教师的代表七十多人，对如何在高等学校中更好地讲授马克思列宁主义基础这门课，进行了讨论。
  会上，大家就中国人民大学马列主义基础教研室草拟的马克思列宁主义基础教学大纲进行了研究。大家认为这个教学大纲问题集中、重点突出，基本上体现了理论联系实际的方针。但是同时也对大纲中某些专题的内容做了具体的增删；并认为大纲反映人民民主国家的革命建设经验，资本主义国家和殖民地半殖民地国家工人运动的历史经验还不够，在教学实践中应充实这方面的内容。在讨论中大家一致认为，必须大力克服教条主义习气，提倡创造性地研究理论。会上对在政治理论课的教学内容上是否容许百家争鸣的问题，有人认为只在教研室内可以争鸣，而在课堂上不可以。经过讨论，大多数人认为应该容许教师在讲课时发表与别人不同的见解。
    为了提倡学生的独立思考、独立研究，适当减轻学生的课堂负担，讨论中认为文、史、哲、政法、财经等系科讲授马克思列宁主义基础课的学时应减少到102学时；理、工、农、医等系科则减少到六十八学时；并准许各类学校根据具体条件在执行时有较大灵活性。
