    China-Romania Basketball Teams Hold First Match
    Beijing Team Leads by Three Points
    (Our dispatch) The Romanian men's basketball team, which is visiting our country, played its first match against the Beijing team at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 20th. When the game reached the last second, Romanian guard number 5, Dev, threw the ball from beyond the mid-court line. The ball entered the net with the sound of the buzzer, and the whole audience burst into applause. The final score was 68 to 65, with the Beijing team winning.
    Both sides performed well in this game. The Beijing team launched successful fast breaks five minutes after the start of the game, taking a 21-14 lead. However, the Romanian team later seized the opportunity of the Beijing team's inaccurate mid-range shooting to steal the ball and counterattack, and replaced center Cucos, who is 2.02 meters tall, posing a great threat to the Beijing team. The score at halftime was 27-27, with neither side gaining an advantage.
    In the second half, the Romanian team launched a fierce offensive, with forward number 10, Fldor, and guard number 5, Dev, playing steadily and quickly, and center number 7, Novacek, providing excellent support. They once led 34-29. However, the Beijing team then successfully played a long period of fast breaks, turning defeat into victory with a score of 49-37. In the last twelve minutes, the Romanian team changed to a special tactic to prevent the Beijing team from scoring layups, and as a result, they narrowed the gap to 63-66, only three points behind. It was not until the last ten seconds that the Beijing team made a free throw, which sealed the victory.
    Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China Zhu De, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Xiaoping, and He Long watched the evening's game. At the end of the game, Zhu De and He Long, accompanied by the Romanian Ambassador to China, Chioroiu, and the Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers' Committee for Physical Culture and Sports, M. Podnarash, went to the court to take pictures with the players from both sides. (Dian Yi)

    中罗篮球队昨举行首次比赛
    北京队以三分之差领先
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的罗马尼亚男子篮球队，二十日晚上在北京体育馆同北京队进行了第一场比赛。当比赛进行到最后一秒钟的时候，罗队后卫五号?德夫在未过中线处就将球抛出，球随锣声进入网内，这时全场掌声雷动。比赛结果是六十八比六十五，北京队胜。
    这场球赛双方都有很好的表现。北京队在开球五分钟后，快攻连连成功，以二十一比十四领先。但后来罗队趁北京队中距离投篮不准的机会抢球反攻，并换上身高二点零二公尺的中锋库科斯，给北京队很大威胁。上半时比分是二十七平，双方不分胜负。
    下半时罗队展开猛烈进攻，前锋十号弗尔多和后卫五号?德夫打得又稳、又快，中锋七号诺瓦契克策应得也很好，曾以三十四比二十九领先。但此后北京队又成功地打了一段长时间的快攻，以四十九比三十七转败为胜。最后十二分钟的时候，罗队改变了一种特殊的打法来阻止北京队上篮，结果追至六十三比六十六，仅差三分。直到最后十秒钟北京队罚进一个球，才奠定了大局。
    中华人民共和国副主席朱德、国务院副总理邓小平、贺龙都观看了晚间的比赛。在比赛结束时，朱德、贺龙由罗马尼亚驻我国大使乔洛尤和罗马尼亚部长会议体育运动委员会主席马·波德纳拉斯陪同到场上同双方队员在一起照了像。　（甸义）
