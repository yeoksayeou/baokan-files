Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. The "Labor Daily" recently reported that a laboratory in the Soviet Union, due to a violation of the operating procedures of an experimental atomic reactor, two people near the device were exposed to short-term gamma and neutron radiation, and consequently suffered from severe radiation sickness. Twenty minutes after the accident, one patient experienced drowsiness and headaches, and nausea. After two weeks, his hair began to fall out. By the twenty-fourth day, his condition deteriorated sharply. The other patient's condition was even more severe; after the nineteenth day, he had a fever of 40 degrees Celsius for thirteen consecutive days, and many blood spots appeared on his skin. Both patients were immediately sent to the hospital for treatment after the accident. Treatment included antibiotics, hemostatic agents, and blood-formation stimulants. During treatment, patients were injected with large doses of penicillin and streptomycin, and blood transfusions were given every three to five days. In this way, the patients began to recover after three months.

The "Labor Daily" pointed out that radiation sickness is a new disease of the twentieth century. Soviet medical scientists are actively studying the development and treatment of radiation sickness and have already developed some drugs and methods for treating this disease.

Academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, Golizantov, told a reporter from the "Labor Daily" that an anti-reticular cytotoxic serum is now used in the treatment of radiation sickness. Medical scientists have conducted experiments on dogs, rabbits, and mice, and have found that the use of anti-reticular cytotoxic serum in combination with antibiotics and new vitamin B12 has good results. The use of BK8 blood substitutes can greatly alleviate the condition of radiation sickness. Alcohol-glucose-citrate blood is also one of the effective agents. A drug made from bovine bone marrow has finally been successfully manufactured, and this drug also has good effects in the treatment of radiation sickness.

Currently, medical scientists are conducting in-depth and comprehensive research on the damage to living organisms caused by the effects of ionizing radiation, changes in the nervous system and blood components, and the formation of toxins in the body.

    研究电离射线对生物机体的破坏
    苏联治疗放射线中毒症有成效
    新华社莫斯科9日电　不久以前，“劳动报”报道说，苏联有一个实验室曾经因为违反试验性原子反应堆的操作规程，离装置不远的两个人遭到了丙种射线和中子射线的短时间的照射，于是他们就患了严重的放射线中毒症。在事故发生的二十分钟后，有一个病人发生昏睡和头痛的现象，并且作呕。过了两周，他的头发开始脱落。到二十四天，他的感觉急剧恶化。另一个病人的情况更加严重，他到第十九天后，一连十三天体温高达四十度，皮肤出现许多血斑。两个病人在事故发生后立即送往医院治疗。医治的时候采用了抗生素、止血剂和血液生成刺激素。医疗期间，给病人注射大量青霉素和链霉素，每隔三、五天给病人输血一次。这样，三个月后病人才开始复原。
    “劳动报”指出，放射线中毒症是二十世纪的一种新疾病。苏联医学家正在积极研究放射线中毒症的发展和治疗问题，并且已经研究出了一些治疗这种病的药剂和方法。
    苏联医学通讯院士戈里藏托夫对“劳动报”记者说，现在在医治放射线中毒症的时候采用一种抗网状细胞毒素血清。医学家们在狗、兔子和老鼠的身上作了试验，他们把抗网状细胞毒素血清同抗生素和新的维他命B12配合起来使用有良好的效果。采用BK8血液代替品可以大大减轻放射性中毒症的病况。酒精葡萄糖柠檬酸盐血液也是有效的药剂之一。一种用牛骨髓制的药剂终于制造成功，这种药剂在医治放射线中毒症的时候也有良好的效果。
    现在，医学家们正在深入地和全面地研究由于电离射线的影响对生物机体的破坏现象，神经系统和血液成分的变化以及毒质在机体内的形成。
