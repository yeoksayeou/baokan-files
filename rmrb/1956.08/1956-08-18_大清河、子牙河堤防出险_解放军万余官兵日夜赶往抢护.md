Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 17th—More than 10,000 officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hebei Province have rushed to the dykes of the Daqing River and Ziya River to help flood prevention workers protect the dykes that are in danger.

On August 8th, the Daqing River breached at Renzhuangzi in Wen'an County, and the river dyke successively collapsed and sank, making the situation very dangerous. Three thousand officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have arrived at the flood prevention position to help flood prevention workers fight the flood, and another two thousand officers and soldiers are rushing to the dangerous dyke day and night. After the dykes in Dacheng and other places downstream of the Ziya River were in danger, 6,900 officers and soldiers also rushed to protect them. At present, except for a part of the rescue team that remains at both ends of the breach at Yaomadu in Dacheng County, most of them have been transferred to the lower reaches of the Grand Canal.

    大清河、子牙河堤防出险
    解放军万余官兵日夜赶往抢护
    新华社保定17日电　驻河北省的中国人民解放军一万多名官兵已经先后赶到大清河、子牙河堤上，帮助防汛民工抢护出险的堤防。
    八月八日，大清河在文安县任庄子决口，河堤相继塌坡下沉，情况非常危险。人民解放军三千名官兵已经赶到了防汛阵地，帮助防汛民工与洪水展开搏斗，另外还有两千名官兵正向险堤日夜急进。子牙河下游大城等地堤防出险后，六千九百名官兵也赶去抢护。现在，这支抢险队伍除一部分仍留在大城县姚马度决口口门两端守护以外，大部分已经转到南运河下游。
