Xinhua News Agency, Hefei. The industrial leadership organs of Anhui Province recently inspected the quality of daily-use industrial products produced in the province and found that the quality of many products has improved significantly compared to the past. The qualified rate of bamboo-cased thermos bottles produced by the joint state-private Wuhu Glass Factory has increased from 40% to 97%. The appearance, water resistance, pressure resistance, and insulation performance of the thermos bottles all meet the quality standards stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry and have been rated as one of the national excellent products. The quality of Wuhu brand matches produced by the local state-owned Wuhu Match Factory has also improved greatly and has become a relatively superior product. The enamel basins produced by the joint state-private Hefei Enamel Factory used to have many cracks, burnt edges, and broken edges. Now, not only have these shortcomings been overcome, but the styles are also beautiful, the colors are bright, and the qualified rate has reached 96%.

In the first quarter of this year, the quality of most of the products produced by factories in Anhui Province producing daily-use industrial products did not meet the requirements stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry. In order to change this situation, industrial administrative departments at all levels, through various meetings, seriously criticized and exposed the erroneous ideas of some factory leaders who neglected product quality, and launched a widespread movement among employees to improve product quality.

Most factories in Anhui Province also sent cadres, technicians, and workers to factories in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places to learn from the advanced experience of these factories in improving product quality, and solved many difficulties in production technology.

    安徽省日用工业品质量提高
    新华社合肥电　安徽省工业领导机关最近检查了这个省生产的日用工业品的质量情况，发现许多产品的质量比过去有显著提高。公私合营芜湖玻璃厂生产的竹壳水瓶的合格率，已经从40％上升到97％；水瓶的外观形状和耐水、耐压、保温等性能，都符合轻工业部规定的质量指标，被评为全国优良产品之一。地方国营芜湖市火柴厂生产的芜湖牌火柴，质量也有了很大改进，成为比较优良的产品。公私合营合肥搪瓷厂过去生产的搪瓷面盆裂纹、焦边和断边的很多，现在不仅克服了这些缺点，而且式样美观，色彩鲜艳，合格率达到96％。
    安徽省生产日用工业品的工厂，今年第一季度的产品质量大部分没有达到轻工业部规定的要求。为了改变这种情况，各级工业行政管理部门通过各种会议，严肃地批判和揭发了某些工厂领导干部忽视产品质量的错误思想，发动职工广泛地开展了提高产品质量的运动。
    安徽省大部分工厂还派了干部、技师和工人，到上海、北京等地工厂学习了这些工厂提高产品质量的先进经验，解决了生产技术上的许多困难。
