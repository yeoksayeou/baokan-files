Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, August 21st. The last group of 354 Japanese war criminals, who were exempted from prosecution by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of our country today, had their representative, Keiichi Miwa, read a letter of gratitude to the staff of the Fushun War Criminals Management Center before leaving the center this evening.

The letter of gratitude stated: "As we are about to leave this place of rebirth—the management center where we have resided for six years—our hearts are filled with gratitude and shame." The letter of gratitude also said: "Under the guidance of the Chinese people, we have understood the principles of how to be a human being, recognized our past mistakes, and know how to live in the future. We must never use the life that truth has given us on the path of untruth."

The letter of gratitude concluded: "We now have a conscience, understand the principles of things, and are able to take action based on our own judgment. We firmly oppose wars of aggression and will fight for lasting peace and the permanent friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples."

    日本战争犯罪分子
    感谢中国人民的宽大处理
    新华社抚顺21日电　今天受到我国最高人民检察院免予起诉的最后一批354名日本战争犯罪分子，在当晚离开抚顺战犯管理所前，由他们的代表三轮敬一向战犯管理所工作人员宣读了感谢文。
    感谢文说：“当我们就要离开这个重生之地——住居了六年的管理所时，我们心里充满了感谢和惭愧的心情。”感谢文又说：“我们在中国人民的教导下，明白了怎样做人的道理，认识了过去的错误和将来如何活下去。我们决不能把真理给予我们的生命，使用在非真理的道路上。”
    感谢文最后说：“我们现在已经有了良心，明白了事物的道理，已经能够用自己的判断采取行动了。我们坚决反对侵略战争，为了持久和平和中日两国人民的永久友谊而斗争。”
    这一批被宽释的人，在管理所举行了最后一次的演出会。
