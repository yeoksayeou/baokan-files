Reckoning Wrongly with an Upside-Down Abacus
Hui Zhi

There's a popular saying among the masses: "Those who know how to use an abacus use it correctly; those who don't use it upside down." People who use the abacus upside down always come up with a muddled account. The "losing money theory" that has been circulating in some places recently is an account wrongly calculated with an upside-down abacus.

What is the "losing money theory"? Some agricultural cooperatives, when developing diversified operations, first established this principle: if the average income value per labor day exceeds the planned income value per labor day within the cooperative, this production is included in the business scope; if it is less than the original planned income value per labor day, it is considered "losing money." Anything deemed "losing money" is rejected outright. For example, the Xiangqian Agricultural Cooperative in Ji'an County, Jilin Province, originally planned to engage in a sideline occupation during the slack season. Later, they calculated that each labor day would only earn 1.50 yuan, which was 0.80 yuan less than the cooperative's original planned 2.30 yuan, so they didn't pursue it because they would "lose" 0.80 yuan.

In fact, this calculation is completely wrong. If earning 0.80 yuan less per labor day is considered losing 0.80 yuan, and you don't do it for fear of losing 0.80 yuan, aren't you simply throwing away the 1.50 yuan of income? Provided that the original production plan is not hindered, earning an additional labor day means an additional income of 1.50 yuan; the more labor days you work, the more income you generate. Where does the "loss" come from? Of course, because the value of these labor days is relatively low, the average value of all labor days in the cooperative will be pulled down somewhat. But what does it matter? As long as the cooperative's total income increases, even if the value of each labor day decreases somewhat, the total income of the members will still increase greatly due to the increase in the number of labor days worked by each laborer.

Others, although they understand this principle, are afraid that the value of the labor day will be lower than the planned figure, which would not show the superiority of collectivization, affect the reputation of the cooperative, and affect the labor enthusiasm of the members. This concern is even more superfluous. Whether an agricultural cooperative is well-run is not only reflected in the high or low value of labor days, but more importantly in whether the actual income of the members increases more or less. If the actual income of the members does not increase, even if the value of the labor day is high, it is only a false phenomenon; a false phenomenon will not bring a good reputation to the agricultural cooperative, nor can it inspire the labor enthusiasm of the members. Only when the total income of the members increases can the superiority of collectivization be truly demonstrated.

People who have calculated wrongly, quickly put the abacus right and use it correctly!

    倒打算盘算错了账
    慧之
    群众中有句很流行的话：“会打算盘的正打，不会打的倒打。”倒打算盘的人，算出来的总是一笔糊涂账。近来流传在某些地方的“赔钱论”，就是一笔倒打了算盘算错了的账。
    什么是“赔钱论”呢？有些农业社在开展多种经营时，首先确定了这样一条原则：如果每个劳动日平均收入的价值，超过社内原来每个劳动日计划收入的价值，这项生产就列在经营范围之内；要是少于原来每个劳动日计划收入的价值，就认为是“赔钱”。凡属“赔钱”的，都一概不搞。例如吉林省辑安县向前农业社原来准备在挂锄期间搞一项副业。后来一算，每个劳动日只能挣一元五角，比社内原计划的二元三角少了八角，就因为要“赔”八角而不搞了。
    其实，这个算盘完全打错了。如果每个劳动日少挣八角钱就算赔了八角，因怕赔八角而不搞，那不是把一元五角的收入白白丢掉了吗？在不妨碍原定生产计划的前提下，多做一个劳动日，就多收入一元五角；劳动日做得愈多，收入也就愈多，“赔”字从何而来呢？当然，由于这些劳动日的价值比较低些，全社劳动日平均价值也会被扯得低了些。但是，这又有什么关系呢？只要社内总收入增加了，虽然每个劳动日的价值降低了些，而由于每个劳动力所做的劳动日数的增多，社员的总收入也还是会大大增加的。
    另有些人虽然懂得这个道理，但又怕劳动日价值比计划数低了，显不出合作化的优越性，影响了社的声誉，影响了社员的劳动情绪。这种顾虑更是多余的。农业社办得好不好，不光是表现在劳动日价值的高低上，更主要的是社员实际收入增加的多还是少。如果社员实际收入不增加，劳动日价值虽高那也只是一种虚假现象；虚假现象不会给农业社带来好的声誉，也不能鼓舞社员的劳动积极性。只有社员的总收入增加了，才真正显示出合作化的优越性。
    算错了账的人们，快把算盘放正了打吧！
