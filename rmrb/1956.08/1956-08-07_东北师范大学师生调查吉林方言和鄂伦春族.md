    (Our Newspaper) Changchun - During the summer vacation, the Chinese and History Departments of Northeast Normal University organized faculty and students to investigate the dialects of Jilin Province and the situation of the Oroqen people in Heilongjiang Province.

    The Chinese Department, with thirty-eight teachers, graduate students, and students, formed the Jilin Province Dialect Investigation Group and arrived in thirty investigation points in batches from mid-July. Currently, they are active in Yanji, Dunhua, and other places, investigating the dialects of these areas and understanding the phonological systems of dialects and sub-dialects. Through this investigation, a general understanding of the special vocabulary and grammatical structures of Jilin dialects will be obtained.

They are investigating the Oroqen people's hunting production methods, lifestyles, and cultural conditions; investigating vestiges of the primitive commune system; and investigating the lives of the Oroqen people after liberation. After investigation and research, a history of the Oroqen people will be compiled.
