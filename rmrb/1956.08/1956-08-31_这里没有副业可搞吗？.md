    Is there no sideline business to be done here?
    (Our report) The farmers of Daguantun, Tianba Township, Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in western Yunnan are actively developing diversified economic activities. In the past, the farmers here always thought that besides doing small business, there was nothing else to develop as a sideline. Since the establishment of the cooperative, labor has been rationally arranged, coupled with the government's advocacy and guidance, the cooperative has drawn surplus labor to engage in a variety of sidelines. The collectively managed sidelines mainly include mud work, making vermicelli, raising pigs, raising ducks, raising silkworms, and growing tea; the individually managed sidelines mainly include weaving cloth, raising chickens, and raising horses. The total income from sidelines can reach more than 25,000 yuan, accounting for 38.47% of the total income of the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production, which has greatly increased the income of the cooperative. At the same time, members are encouraged to vigorously develop individual sidelines. There are a total of 54 mares raised individually in the cooperative, and more than 30 foals have been born this year alone. In the past, many barren mountains in the vicinity were not utilized. Now the cooperative has planted 30 mu of tea trees, and another 30 mu will be planted this autumn. In three or four years, tea picking will also be a large source of income.

    这里没有副业可搞吗？
    本报讯　云南西部德宏傣族?颇族自治州保山县田坝乡大官屯的农民积极发展多种经济。过去这里农民一直认为除了兼做小生意而外，就没有什么副业可以发展，自从合作社建立起来以后，劳动力得到合理安排，加上政府的倡议和指导，社里抽出多余的劳动力经营了多种副业，集体经营的副业主要是做泥工、做粉丝、养猪、养鸭、养蚕和种茶等；个人经营的副业主要是织布、养鸡、养马等。整个副业总共可收入二万五千多元，占全社农副业总收入的38.47％。对合作社收入的增加起了很大作用。同时还鼓励社员大力发展个体副业，社里个人喂养的母马共有五十四匹，光今年生的小马就有三十多匹。过去这里附近的很多荒山都没有被利用起来，现在社里就种下了三十亩茶树，今年秋季还要加种三十亩，三、四年以后，采茶也是一大笔收入。
