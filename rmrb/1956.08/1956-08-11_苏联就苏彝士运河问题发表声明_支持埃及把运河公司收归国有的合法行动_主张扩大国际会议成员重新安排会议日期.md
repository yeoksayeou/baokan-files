Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: TASS, Moscow, August 9th: The Soviet government has issued a statement on the Suez Canal issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On August 3, 1956, the British Ambassador to Moscow, Sir Patrick Reilly, delivered to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Shepilov, a note from the British government, which included the text of a declaration by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States regarding the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company by Egypt. Based on this tripartite declaration, the British government invited the Soviet government to participate in a conference to be held in London on August 16, 1956, "to discuss measures to ensure the continued navigation of the canal in accordance with the guarantees made by the Convention of October 29, 1888."

In light of this, the Soviet government considers it necessary to make the following statement.

The Soviet government cannot agree with the assessment of the situation in the Suez Canal region made in the tripartite declaration.

While the governments of the Western powers recognize Egypt as a fully sovereign and independent state with the right to nationalize property under its jurisdiction, they simultaneously attempt to cast doubt on the legality of the Egyptian government's action in nationalizing the Suez Canal Company. The tripartite declaration makes the completely unfounded claim that the company is an "international institution" whose status cannot be changed by the Egyptian government.

This ignores the fact that, even under the 1866 treaty that placed Egypt in an unequal position, the Suez Canal Company, from its establishment, was considered an Egyptian company managed according to Egyptian laws and customs. The nationalization of the Suez Canal Company has nothing to do with the issue of guaranteeing freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal as stipulated in the 1888 Special Convention. It is legally unfounded to suggest that this private company governed by Egyptian law should be regarded as an international institution guaranteeing navigation on the Suez Canal.

The nationalization of an enterprise located on its own territory by a country is, according to recognized principles of international law, a matter of that country's internal affairs. This has been the view held regarding the decisions made by various sovereign states over the past few decades to nationalize such property (including property with foreign capital participation) on more than one occasion.

It should also be pointed out that in December 1952, the United Nations General Assembly also adopted a special resolution on the right of countries to freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources. The United Nations General Assembly called on countries not to take actions that undermine the sovereignty of other countries in this regard.

In light of this, the Soviet government believes that the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company is a completely legal action taken in accordance with Egyptian sovereignty.

The British government and the French government oppose the Egyptian government's announcement of the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company on the grounds that they are concerned with ensuring freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. However, the transfer of ownership of the former Suez Canal Company to the Egyptian state has not changed the existing navigation regime of the Suez Canal in any way.

The government of the Republic of Egypt formally declared to the Soviet government, as well as to the governments of all other countries, on August 1st that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company would not affect Egypt's relevant international obligations in any way, and that Egypt would fully comply with the freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal as stipulated in the 1888 Convention. The Soviet government accepted this statement from the Egyptian government and believes that there is no reason to express any concern in this regard, especially since the Suez Canal runs through Egyptian territory, and Egypt is no less concerned with and capable of guaranteeing the normal navigation of the canal than any private joint-stock company. In fact, after the Suez Canal Company was nationalized, the uninterrupted navigation of ships of all countries on the Suez Canal was not affected at all, and the Suez Canal continued to function as it did before nationalization.

It is thus clear that the Egyptian government fully takes into account the great significance of freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal. Therefore, the concerns expressed in this regard in the tripartite declaration are unfounded. It should be pointed out that Egypt, while guaranteeing respect for freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal, has also decided to compensate the shareholders of the canal company for their losses.

Therefore, Egypt's actions are completely legal and justified, as it has promised to guarantee the normal navigation of this canal, which was dug by Egyptians themselves and passes through Egyptian territory. It is true that the Suez Canal has not been in the hands of Egypt for the past few decades, but in the hands of a company dominated by British and French capital, which used this Egyptian canal to make a fortune and interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. However, this fact cannot be used as a basis for maintaining this abnormal situation in the future.

It must be taken into account that the relations established in the past through conquest and occupation are no longer appropriate today. They are not in line with the principles of cooperation between sovereign and equal states, nor with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. Since the British government, the French government, and the United States government all recognize the lofty principles of the United Nations and express their welcome to the changes in their relations with those countries that were previously in a colonial and subordinate position, then the governments of the aforementioned three countries should not hinder these countries from exercising their sovereignty.

The Soviet government cannot ignore the fact that the situation in the Near East and the Middle East is now becoming increasingly tense. As soon as the profits of the Suez Canal Company were touched, the British government and the French government immediately exerted crude and unjustified pressure on Egypt, imposing economic sanctions on it, declaring their navies on combat alert, concentrating naval forces near the Suez Canal, announcing the mobilization of reservists, preparing landing forces, and so on. The newspapers of France, Britain, and certain other Western countries are vigorously inciting hostility towards independent Egypt.

By taking such actions that endanger peace and security, the British government and the French government are embarking on a path that violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. This is because such behavior cannot be reconciled with the obligations of member states of the United Nations, which are: to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force, and to settle international disputes by peaceful means, so as not to endanger international peace and security.

The Soviet government believes that the measures currently being taken by the British and French governments are completely intolerable and considers them to be a provocation against the cause of peace.

It is quite clear that such measures cannot but arouse righteous indignation, and they will be met not only with the deserved resistance of Egypt, but also with the deserved resistance of the peoples of other countries who are fighting for their sovereignty and national independence. Attempts to use force against Egypt, which is exercising its sovereignty, will first and foremost cause serious damage to the interests of the Western powers themselves in the Near and Middle East.

The nationalization of the Suez Canal does not harm the interests of the people of Britain, France, the United States, and other countries. Only the former Suez Canal Company, which derived huge profits from the use of the Suez Canal, can no longer enrich itself at the expense of Egypt's interests. Attempts to forcibly restore the privileges lost by this company, or to force Egypt to accept the rule of foreign capital under other pretexts, have a clear colonialist nature.

    苏联就苏彝士运河问题发表声明
    支持埃及把运河公司收归国有的合法行动
    主张扩大国际会议成员重新安排会议日期
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联政府发表了关于苏彝士运河问题的声明。声明全文如下：
    1956年8月3日，英国驻莫斯科大使海特尔把英国政府的一份照会交给苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫，照会中附有英、法、美三国政府就有关埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的问题所发表的声明文本。英国政府根据这个三国声明，邀请苏联政府参加1956年8月16日在伦敦召开的会议，“以便讨论如何使运河能够按照1888年10月29日的公约所作的保证继续通航的措施”。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府认为必须作如下的声明。
    苏联政府不能够同意三国声明中对苏彝士运河地区的局势所作的估计。
    西方强国的政府虽然承认埃及作为一个完全有主权的和独立的国家，有权把属于埃及管辖的财产收归国有，但同时却企图怀疑埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的行动的合法性。三国声明中发表了完全没有论据的说法，硬说这个公司是一个“国际机构”，而这个机构的现状不是埃及政府所能改变的。
    这里忽视了这样一个事实：即使根据使埃及处于不平等地位的1866年条约，苏彝士运河公司从它成立之日起，就被认为是一个根据埃及的法律和习惯来管理的埃及的公司。苏彝士运河公司的国有化同1888年专门公约规定的保证苏彝士运河通航自由的问题没有任何关系。有人想把事情说成似乎这个受埃及法律管辖的私人公司应当被看作一个保障苏彝士运河通航的国际机构，这在法律上是毫无根据的。
    一个国家把在它自己领土上的企业的所有权收归国有，从公认的国际法的原则看来，是这个国家的内政。大家对最近几十年来各个主权国家不止一次地作出的把这样的财产（其中包括有外国资本参加的财产）收归国有的决定，都是抱着这样的看法的。
    这里还应当指出，1952年12月联合国大会还通过了一项关于各国有权利自由支配自己的自然财富和资源的专门决议。联合国大会呼吁各国在这一点上不得有破坏别国主权的行为。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府认为，埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的决定是根据埃及主权作出的完全合法的行动。
    英国政府和法国政府反对埃及政府宣布把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的理由是：它们关心于保障苏彝士运河的通航自由。但是，把前苏彝士运河公司的所有权转到埃及国家手中，并没有使苏彝士运河现行的通航制度有任何改变。
    埃及共和国政府在八月一日向苏联政府以及其他一切国家政府正式声明，把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，完全不影响埃及所承担的有关的国际义务，埃及将完全遵守1888年的公约所规定的苏彝士运河的通航自由。苏联政府接受了埃及政府的这一声明，并且认为，没有什么理由在这方面表示什么担心，何况苏彝士运河是流经埃及领土的，埃及在关心和保障运河的正常通航方面并不比任何私人股份公司做得要差些。事实上，苏彝士运河公司被收归国有以后，各国船只在苏彝士运河上的不间断的通航也完全没有受到影响，苏彝士运河像国有化以前一样，仍旧在发挥它的职能。
    由此可见，埃及政府充分考虑到苏彝士运河通航自由的重大意义，因此三国声明在这方面所表示的担心是没有根据的。应当指出，埃及一方面保证尊重苏彝士运河的通航自由，另一方面还决定补偿运河公司股票持有人的损失。
    因此，埃及既已答应保障这一由埃及人亲手开凿的通过埃及国境的运河的正常通航，它所采取的行动就是完全合法的，正当的。固然，苏彝士运河在过去几十年间没有掌握在埃及手里，而是掌握在英法资本占主要地位的公司手里，这个公司利用这一埃及的运河来发财，干涉埃及的内政，然而，这一事实却不能作为今后还保持这种不正常局面的根据。
    不能不考虑到，过去通过征服和占领的方法建立起来的关系在今天是不合适的了，是不符合主权国家和平等国家之间实行合作的原则，不符合联合国组织的原则和宗旨的了。既然英国政府和法国政府以及美国政府都承认联合国组织的崇高原则，并且表示它们欢迎它们同那些过去处在殖民地附属地位的国家之间的关系的改变，那末上述三国的政府就不应当阻碍这些国家来行使自己的主权。
    苏联政府不能忽视近东和中东的局势现在日趋紧张这一事实。苏彝士运河公司的收益刚一遭到触动，英国政府和法国政府立即就对埃及施加粗暴的、毫无理由的压力，对它实行经济制裁，宣布自己的海军进入战斗准备，并且把海军部队集结在苏彝士运河附近，宣布动员后备军人，准备登陆部队等等。法国和英国以及其他某些西方国家的报纸大肆煽动对独立的埃及的敌视情绪。
    英国政府和法国政府采取这样一些会危及和平和安全的行动，就是走上了违背联合国宪章原则的道路。因为这种行为是不可能同联合国会员国的义务协调起来的；会员国的义务是：不在国际关系中用武力进行威胁或是使用武力，应当通过和平方式解决国际争端，从而不使国际和平和安全受到威胁。
    苏联政府认为，英法两国政府目前所采取的措施是完全不能容忍的，并且认为这是对和平事业的挑衅。
    十分清楚，这种措施不能不激起正义的愤慨，它们不仅将受到埃及的应有的反击，而且还将受到正在为自己的主权和民族独立而斗争的其他国家人民的应有的反击。想对正在行使自己的主权的埃及使用武力的企图首先会使西方强国自身在中近东地区的利益遭受严重的损失。
    苏彝士运河的国有化并不损害英国、法国、美国和其他国家人民的利益。只有从使用苏彝士运河获得巨额利润的前苏彝士运河公司，现在再也不能靠牺牲埃及的利益来发财致富了。想用强力恢复这个公司所丧失的特权，或是想用其他幌子强迫埃及接受外国资本的统治的这些企图带有明显的殖民主义性质。
