Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Nearly 400,000 university students are confidently welcoming the new academic year.

This year, the number of new students entering the nation's 225 higher education institutions is greater than any previous year; the number of students enrolled also exceeds the figures required for the 1956-1957 academic year in the First Five-Year Plan. More than 1,500 students from Hong Kong and Macao and returned overseas Chinese students will join tens of thousands of university students to study in several universities in southern China.

In order to meet the urgent need for senior specialized personnel in national construction during the Second Five-Year Plan, 34 new higher education institutions of various types have been established nationwide this year. A new electrical engineering school recently approved to be established in Shanghai will use the name of the former Jiaotong University, Nanyang Institute of Technology. The incoming freshmen will number 400. New schools established for the first time in our country, such as the Shanghai Shipbuilding College, Xi'an Power College, Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping, Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, as well as a comprehensive university focusing on majors such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry—Zhengzhou University—are welcoming their first batch of students with a brand-new look.

The faces of many schools are changing with each passing day, constantly preparing to meet the ever-increasing task of cultivating advanced construction talents. Jiaotong University, which just celebrated its 60th anniversary, will have half of its students attend classes at the new campus in Xi'an this year. The completed teaching buildings, practice factories, faculty and student dormitories at the new campus cover an area of nearly 140,000 square meters, which is larger than the old campus in Shanghai. When fully completed, it will be more than twice the size of the old campus in Shanghai. Sichuan University's College of Agriculture is independently established this year, starting a new academic year at the new campus in Ya'an.

Higher normal schools undertake the noble task of cultivating talent to cultivate talent. With the development of senior high schools, the number of higher normal schools has increased from the original 40 to 53 this year (excluding the Normal College of Yanbian University and the Normal Department of Xinjiang College). Twenty thousand primary school teachers and graduates from secondary normal schools will join the nearly 40,000 new students to pursue further studies in higher normal schools.

Among the new students applying for higher art schools, many have shown artistic talent, so the number of new students in higher art schools has increased from the originally planned 900 to more than 1,000 this year.

More than one hundred foreign students who spent their summer vacation in various parts of our country have returned to their schools one after another. This year, Peking University, Guilin Chinese Language Training School, and other schools will welcome more than 560 new students from 23 countries, including the Soviet Union and Vietnam, to study in China.

    近四十万大学生迎接新学年
    新华社30日讯　近四十万的大学生满怀信心地迎接新的学年。
    今年，进入全国二百二十五所高等学校的新生比以往任何一年都要多；在校学生数也超过了第一个五年计划中1956—1957学年所要求达到的数字。一千五百多名港澳学生和归国华侨学生将要和成万名大学生一起进入祖国南方的几所高等学校学习。
    为了迎接第二个五年计划中，国家建设对高级专门人才的迫切要求，今年全国新建的各类高等学校有三十四所。最近批准在上海成立的一所电机类的新校，将沿用交通大学前身南洋工学院这个校名，入学的新生将有四百名。我国第一次建立的上海造船学院、西安动力学院、武汉测量制图学院、成都电讯工程学院等新校，以及以数学、物理学、化学等专业为主而建立的一所综合大学——郑州大学，以全新的面貌迎接第一批学生。
    很多学校的面貌正日新月异地改变着，时刻准备着迎接与日俱增的培养高级建设人才的任务。刚刚度过六十周年校庆的交通大学，今年将有一半学生在西安的新校舍上课。新校址已建成的教学大楼、实习工厂、教职员和学生宿舍等的面积已接近十四万平方公尺，比在上海的旧校址面积还大，将来全部建成后要比上海的旧校址面积大一倍以上。四川大学农学院今年独立建校，在雅安新校址开始新的学年。
    高等师范学校担负着培养培养人才的人才这个崇高任务。随着高级中学的发展，今年高等师范学校从原有的四十所增加到五十三所（不包括延边大学师范学院和新疆学院师范部）。二万名小学教师和中等师范学校的毕业生将要和其余的近四万名新生一起进入高等师范学校深造。
    投考高等艺术学校的新生中，很多人表现出具有艺术才能，所以今年高等艺术学校的新生从原计划的九百多人增加到了一千多人。
    在我国各地度过暑假的一百多名外国留学生已经陆续回到学校。今年，北京大学、桂林语文专修学校等校又将迎接从苏联、越南等二十三个国家来中国学习的五百六十多名新生。
