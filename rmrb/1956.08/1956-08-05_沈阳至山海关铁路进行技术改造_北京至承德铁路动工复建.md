Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: A comprehensive technical upgrading of the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan railway line is underway. Over thirty stations have already completed the extension of their internal track lines. 35% of the railway line requiring major repairs has been replaced with new sleepers and rails. The extension project for the Banjiahe Bridge, designed to prevent flooding from the Ju River, has also been completed and opened to traffic on August 2nd. Currently, larger projects such as the expansion of Jinzhou Station, the reduction of gradients from Jinxi to Hanjiagou and from Qianwei to Gaoling, are all under construction. Automatic block signals along the Shenyang Yuguo to Gaotaishan section have recently begun installation.

The Shenyang-Shanhaiguan railway is the main line connecting areas inside and outside the Shanhai Pass. With the development of the national economy, the transport volume on this line has increased year by year, increasingly exposing the mismatch between its technical equipment and the transport volume it bears. Especially after the launch of the axle load exceeding movement, although the locomotive traction capacity has potential, it is limited by insufficient station track length, bridge load capacity, and excessive gradients. Therefore, the technical upgrading of this railway is very urgent. According to the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's two-year plan for 1956 to 1957, the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line will undergo a comprehensive technical upgrade to expand the capacity of train passage, station yards, water supply, and mechanical equipment maintenance. Over a hundred bridges along the line will have their piers and foundations reinforced, and new beams will be replaced to increase load-bearing capacity. Major repairs will be carried out on three hundred and twenty kilometers of railway, replacing the original 43-kilogram rails with 50-kilogram rails. The internal tracks of the forty-three stations where axle load exceeding trains were too long to stop will be extended. The seven high slopes along the line that previously affected locomotive traction weight will also be lowered. Automatic block signals will also be installed along the entire line, and equipment for supplying locomotives with water will be added to large stations, along with the installation of new centralized electrical signals. After all these technical upgrading projects are completed next year, the number of trains passing through the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line each day can be increased by about one time, with an average of one train passing every six minutes. The weight of goods carried by each train will also be increased from 2,250 tons last year to 3,000 tons, and the speed of vehicles will reach over 100 kilometers per hour.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 3rd: The (Bei)jing-Cheng(de) railway, which has been out of service for many years, began reconstruction in July. The route being rebuilt this time runs from Shangbancheng station on the Jin(zhou)-Cheng(de) railway to Huairou.

From Shangbancheng station southward to Yingshouyingzi, a seventy-plus kilometer section of railway line, 10.7 kilometers of track have already been laid and it is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Concurrently with the commencement of work on this section, work also began in July on the section of railway from Yingshouyingzi to Huairou. The railway route from Shangbancheng to Huairou is 170 kilometers in total length, and is expected to be fully completed by the end of next year. At that time, this section of railway from Shangbancheng to Huairou will be connected to the Beijing to Huairou section that is already open to traffic, allowing the Beijing-Chengde railway to resume train service.

The newly built Shangbancheng to Huairou railway is much shorter than the old route, and also avoids many high slopes that affected train traction weight. After this railway is completed, it will no longer be necessary to detour through Jinzhou to get from Beijing to the Chengde area outside the Great Wall, as is currently the case, and it will be possible to arrive on the same day. This is of great significance for the exploitation of mineral resources in areas outside the Great Wall such as Xinglong and Shouwangfen.

    沈阳至山海关铁路进行技术改造
    北京至承德铁路动工复建
    新华社沈阳3日电　沈阳到山海关的铁路线正在进行全面的技术改造。现在，有三十多个车站已经完成了站内线路延长工程。全线需要大修的铁路有35％更换了新枕木和钢轨。防止巨流河水患的班家河桥梁延长工程也完成了，八月二日开始通车。目前，锦州站场的扩建、锦西至韩家沟和前卫至高岭降低坡度等较大的工程，都正在进行施工。从沈阳裕国到高台山沿线的自动闭塞信号，最近开始安装。
    沈阳至山海关铁路是联系关内外的主要干线。随着国家经济建设的发展，这条线路的运输量逐年上升，日益暴露出技术设备与承担的运量不相适应。特别是在超轴运动展开以后，机车牵引量虽有潜力，但因站内线路长度和桥梁负重不够，坡道过大等而受到限制。因此，这条铁路的技术改造十分迫切。根据锦州铁路管理局1956到1957年的两年规划，沈阳至山海关线将实行全面的技术改造，扩大列车通过、站场、给水和机械设备检修等方面的能力。全线将有一百多座桥梁加固桥墩和桥基，更换新梁，提高负重能力。有三百二十公里的铁路进行大修，把原来四十三公斤的钢轨换成五十公斤的钢轨。过去因超轴列车太长而停留不下的四十三个车站的站内线路都要延长。过去影响机车牵引重量的沿线七处高坡也都要降低。全线沿途还要安装起自动闭塞信号，在大的车站里增添供应机车用水的设备，装设新的电气集中信号。这些技术改造工程在明年全部完成后，沈阳至山海关线每天经过的列车数量可以增加一倍左右，平均每六分钟就可以看到有一列火车跑过去。每列火车拉载货物的重量也要由去年的二千二百五十吨提高到三千吨，车辆行走的速度每小时将可达到一百公里以上。
    新华社锦州3日电　停运多年的（北）京承（德）铁路已在七月份开始动工复建。这次复建的路线是从锦（州）承（德）铁路的上板城车站到怀柔。
    从上板城车站向南到鹰手营子一段七十多公里的铁路路线，现在已经铺轨十点七公里，在今年年底以前就可以修通。在这一段路线开工的同时，从鹰手营子到怀柔的一段铁路也在七月份开工。从上板城到怀柔的铁路路线全长为一百七十公里，明年年底就可以全部建设完工。到那时，上板城到怀柔这段铁路就要和现在已经通车的北京到怀柔段连接起来，使京承铁路重新通起火车。
    新建的上板城到怀柔这段铁路，比过去的旧路线近很多，还避免了很多影响火车牵引重量的高坡。这条铁路修通以后，从北京到长城外面承德一带去，就可以不必再像现在这样绕道锦州，而在当天就可以到达。这对开采长城以外兴隆、寿王坟等地的矿产有着很大意义。
