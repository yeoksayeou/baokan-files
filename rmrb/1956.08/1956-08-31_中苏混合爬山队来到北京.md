Xinhua News Agency, August 30th. The entire team of forty-five members and staff of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, which conquered the "Father of Ice Mountains" - Muztagh Ata, arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon.

The Chinese and Soviet mountaineering team members, after prolonged exposure to the sun, had complexions that had turned black and red. They were all excited and full of energy, and were immediately surrounded by welcoming people as they got off the plane. Representatives of the sports associations of various industrial systems also presented them with flowers.

Chen Rongchang, the first Chinese athlete to climb to the summit of Muztagh Ata, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they were warmly welcomed by people of all ethnic groups when they arrived in Kashgar and Urumqi. He said that after several days of rest, his weight had increased by four kilograms.

The mountaineering team members will attend a celebration held by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for them tomorrow evening.
