    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Defends the Socialist Construction of the Motherland
    The Air Force units of the People's Liberation Army are actively engaged in combat training. This is the squadron leader giving instructions before the flight based on the weather conditions.
    The young naval torpedo boat units are intensifying their training, mastering technology, and defending the motherland. The People's Liberation Army Navy fleet is always ready to strike enemy aircraft invading the motherland's territorial airspace.
    Tank units are on standby.
    Chemical warfare troops use flame throwers to destroy "enemy" fortifications in combat exercises.
    Artillery uses accurate shooting to cover the advance of mechanized infantry. Yu Zhi, Liu Chengxing, etc. photographed (manuscript from the People's Liberation Army Pictorial)
