    "Human Sentiment"
    A "section chief" from the Ministry of Food Industry went to the Dalian Chemical Plant for a visit.
    When people asked this "section chief" comrade for a letter of introduction or other credentials according to regulations, the "section chief" said with righteous indignation: "I have neither a letter of introduction nor credentials." After repeated explanations, the section chief still insisted on entering for a visit. In the end, the factory adhered to principles and refused the section chief entry. Unexpectedly, this greatly displeased the "section chief," who immediately said: "I really didn't expect that coming to your factory would involve so much man-made trouble. Vigilance is necessary, but you are too unreasonable."

    “人情”
    食品工业部一位“处长”到大连化工厂去参观。
    当人们按着制度向这位“处长”同志要介绍信或其他证件时，“处长”理直气壮地说：“我既无介绍信，又无证件。”经再三解释，处长还是要进去参观。最后厂方坚持原则，对处长挡了驾。不料惹起了“处长”大大不满，开口就说：“我真没想到，来到你们厂里竟会有这么些人为的麻烦，警惕是应该有的，可是你们太不近人情了。”
