Xinhua News Agency, 10th - According to the decision of the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the second election of deputies to the People's Congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns will be held this year. At present, all provinces (regions) and cities across the country are actively carrying out preparations for this election. Currently, nineteen provinces (regions) and cities, including Zhejiang, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Beijing, have established election work organizations. Beijing and Tianjin have also established election committees.

The basic-level elections in most provinces and cities will be held between August and November this year. Election work has already begun in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and some counties in Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces. At present, most counties and cities in various provinces are establishing election organizations and starting elections in individual townships and towns to gain experience. Liaoning Province has established election committees and offices in forty-five counties and cities and is now conducting elections in counties such as Yixian, Jianchang, Suizhong, and Xifeng. Zhejiang Province has first conducted elections in eighty-seven townships and towns in fifty-four counties. According to inspections by relevant departments, these township and town elections have generally promoted democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, elected representatives satisfactory to the masses, inspected the work of the government, and paid attention to combining the elections with current production. According to statistics from five townships and towns in Zhejiang Province—Songxi, Yongchang, Huangshan, Anping, and others—the masses put forward more than 1,100 criticisms and suggestions regarding the government's work during the election process. In some townships, the number of voters participating in the election reached more than 95% of the total number of voters. Among the people's representatives elected in Huangshan Town, there were nineteen activists who had newly emerged in the agricultural cooperation movement. Some members of the previous People's Congress who had a poor work style and were out of touch with the masses failed to be re-elected in this election. In many places, the connection between cadres and the masses has become closer after the election, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has increased, and many new atmospheres have emerged.
