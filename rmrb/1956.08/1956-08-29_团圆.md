    Reunion
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Chen Pengsheng
    Recently, a story has been circulating in the rural areas of Mashan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture: a couple who were separated for eighteen years have reunited.
    Twenty years ago, this couple had raised three sons and two daughters, farming more than six mu of land. In 1936, Jiarang Township in Mashan County suffered a major flood, and all the family's fields were ruined. The head of the family, Luo Shicai, had to sell the land to support his family of seven. Due to the pressure of life, in the following year, he successively sold his four eldest children to landlords and rich peasants to pay off debts and as child brides. In the third year, he also sold his wife. From then on, he wandered around until he returned to his hometown after the liberation of Jiarang Township in 1948.
    In 1952, Luo Shicai was allocated land and housing. After inquiring in many ways, he finally found his wife, from whom he had been separated for more than ten years, in Shanglin County, more than a hundred li away. At this time, his wife's husband after her remarriage had already passed away. From then on, the two often visited each other during festivals.
    In June of this year, Jiarang Township encountered another major flood, similar to the one twenty years ago. Luo Shicai's former wife, upon hearing this news, thought that the second disaster had befallen Luo Shicai again. With a heavy heart, she traveled more than a hundred li to visit Luo Shicai. When she arrived in Jiarang Township, Luo Shicai was safe and sound. He also told her that he had joined the advanced cooperative this spring. Although the flood had brought losses to the cooperative, his family still received 350 jin of corn in the summer harvest pre-distribution, and they would receive another distribution of grain and sideline income in the second half of the year, so there was no problem with their livelihood at all. When she heard Luo Shicai say that everything was good in the advanced cooperative, but he still had to cook for himself after work every day, and he still had to grind corn and cook pig feed when he came back from meetings in the middle of the night, she felt very sad. After discussing it, the two of them resumed their marital relationship in early August.

    团圆
    新华社记者　陈蓬生
    最近在桂西僮族自治州马山县的农村里流传着这样一个故事：一对被拆散了十八年的夫妻又团圆了。
    在二十年前，这对夫妻曾养育三男二女，种着六亩多地。1936年，马山县加让乡遭受了一次大水灾，这家的田地全部都没有得到收成，家里的主人罗世才只得卖掉田地来维持全家七口的生活。因为生活的逼迫，第二年先后又把四个大的儿女分别卖给地主和富农抵债和做童养媳。第三年又卖掉了老婆。从此他到处流浪，到1948年加让乡解放后才回到家乡。
    1952年罗世才分得了土地和房屋，他经过多方面打听，终于在一百多里以外的上林县找到了离别十多年的妻子。这时，他的妻子改嫁以后的丈夫已经死去了。从此以后，逢年过节，两人常相往来。
    今年6月间，加让乡又遭遇到和二十年前差不多的一次大水灾。罗世才的这位前妻听到这个消息以后，以为第二次的灾难又降临到罗世才身上来了。她怀着愁疼的心情从百里以外赶去探望罗世才。当她到达加让乡时，罗世才安然无恙。他还告诉她，今年春天他参加了高级社，虽然水灾给社里带来了损失，但是夏收预分时，家里还是分到了三百五十斤玉米，下半年还能分到一次粮食和副业收入，生活完全不成问题。当她听到罗世才说在高级社里样样都好，只是每天做工回来，还要自己煮饭；每天晚上半夜开会回来还要自己磨玉米、煮猪菜时，心里感到很难受。他们两个人经过商议，在8月初恢复了夫妻关系。
