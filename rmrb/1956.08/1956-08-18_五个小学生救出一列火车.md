Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: On the 12th at noon, five elementary school students were fishing by the Songpu District river in Harbin when they suddenly heard a strange sound of water. They quickly stood up to check. It turned out that the river water had soaked the underlying layer of the nearby railway subgrade. The torrential river water was flowing westward through the subgrade, and the subgrade was gradually sinking. The children immediately discussed it and decided to leave two people at the site to signal any approaching trains to prevent accidents. The rest ran as fast as they could to the nearby train station to report the situation. Sure enough, after a while, a train pulling thirty-five carriages came along. At this time, the two elementary school students guarding the railway immediately picked up their clothes and waved them violently, finally stopping the train seventy meters away from the danger zone. Two hours later, the train safely passed over the newly repaired subgrade.

The five elementary school students who saved the train are all students of Chuankou Elementary School in Songpu District. They are Young Pioneers Gao Fuchang, Ji Rong, Wang Liguo, Zhang Zhenying, and Wang Shouyou.

    五个小学生救出一列火车
    据新华社哈尔滨17日电　十二日中午，有五个小学生在哈尔滨松浦区江边钓鱼，突然听到一种奇怪水声，他们连忙站起来查看。原来是江水浸透了附近铁道路基的底层，汹涌的江水正穿过路基滚滚地向西流去，路基已经渐渐下沉。孩子们马上商量了一下，决定留两个人在现场给可能到来的列车打信号，以免列车遇险，其余的人拼命跑向附近的火车站去报信。果然，一会就有一列拖着三十五个车厢的火车开过来了，这时守在铁路上的两个小学生立刻拿起衣服猛烈地摇晃，终于使列车在距离危险地带七十公尺的地方停了下来。两小时以后，这列火车就从刚修好的路基上安全地通过了。
    救出这列火车的五个小学生都是松浦区船口小学校的学生。他们是少先队员高福昌、纪荣、王立国、张振英和王守有。
