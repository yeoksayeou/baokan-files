    New Life on Dachen Island
    Zhong Jingwen
    If you were once deeply impressed by the desolation and devastation of Dachen Island from the documentaries "Liberation of Dachen Island" and "The Disaster of Dachen" filmed a year and a half ago, then seeing the face of Dachen Island today will give you a completely different impression. Today, life is not only revived on the island, but also a thriving scene of peace and prosperity has emerged.
    In Shang Dachen, rows of brand-new bungalows have appeared on the ruins that were once completely destroyed. In Xia Dachen, where the original residents were concentrated and which suffered the most damage, more than 1,000 houses have been successively repaired by the garrison guarding the coast over the past year. The property left behind by the residents who were forced to flee has been carefully cleaned up and kept safe by the People's Government household by household. In one year, the soldiers of the garrison have cleared away the piles of garbage that were everywhere on the island.
    Various new residents of different occupations can be seen everywhere in Dachen. They are all working people who have come here from the mainland to carry out various production and construction tasks. Most of them are farmers and fishermen. Now, two agricultural cooperatives and one fishing cooperative have been established on the island. In addition, there are a considerable number of construction workers and porters. Most eye-catching is the "Wenzhou Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team" composed of more than two hundred young men and women. Their appearance has brought infinite youth and vitality to this ancient and once-desolate Dachen Island.
    In response to the needs of life, nearly ten state-owned enterprises such as supply and marketing cooperatives, post and telecommunications bureaus, bookstores, and banks were established here long ago. Now, various service industries such as restaurants, food stores, retail sales agencies, sewing cooperatives, and barbershops have also been relocated from the mainland. In the past, Dachen residents often had difficulties with drinking water in the summer and autumn due to prolonged drought and water shortage. This year, the soldiers repaired two large reservoirs in a short period of time, and the reservoirs are already full of clear, blue spring water, waiting to supply all residents with drinking water during the upcoming dry season. On the fertile land of Shang and Xia Dachen, soldiers and reclamation team members have planted various flower and tree seeds and tens of thousands of fruit saplings sent from all over the country. Many exquisite small gardens have appeared on the island. On the hills or along the roads, you can see young saplings gradually growing strong under the sea breeze.
    Dachen, like countless islands along the coast of the motherland, is a beautiful and lovely island. What is particularly commendable is that it is one of the largest fishing grounds in the East China Sea. The total area of this fishing ground is more than 10,000 square kilometers. It produces a large amount of yellow croaker, cuttlefish, eel, hairtail, and other fish all year round. In the past, the fishermen here called it their "granary". Today, people who come to Dachen affectionately call it the "treasure island of the motherland." As soon as it was liberated, the fishery production here recovered, and the total annual output reached more than 174,000 dan. Recently, when I first came to Dachen, people were vying to talk about the grand occasion of the spring cuttlefish season that had just ended not long ago: the rich fish schools in Dachen attracted more than 20,000 fishermen from 20 counties in Ningbo, Zhoushan, Wenling, and Fujian. More than 7,000 fishing boats gathered in various ports to sell fish products and purchase daily necessities, making Dachen Island unprecedentedly prosperous. Wang Shoujian, who has been fishing in Dachen since he was a child, said: "I am sixty-four years old this year. Since I was a teenager and could remember things, I have never seen the liveliness of this year's fishing season." During this year's spring fishing season, the Dachen Fishing Cooperative alone caught 3,400 dan of fresh fish.
    With the development of production, the lives of the fishermen here are changing rapidly. In the winter fishing season last year, the average income per household of the Dachen Fishing Cooperative increased more than threefold compared to 1954. Wang Shoujian, an old fisherman who was rescued from the isolated island by our army when Dachen was liberated, and his son Wang Qichang, joined the cooperative last year and received more than 1,600 yuan in the four months of the winter fishing season. The two bought woolen sweaters, made new clothes, the son bought a watch, and deposited 800 yuan in the bank, which has not been used yet. Another old man, Kong Jiangbo, who was on the verge of death when the enemy fled and was rescued from the brink of death by the People's Liberation Army, is eighty-one years old this year. He has been supported by the fishing cooperative since last year and lives a very happy life. The old man himself is not willing to be idle and helps the cooperative with odd jobs. During the winter fishing season, he was responsible for the sideline production of "steaming nets" for fishermen from other places and received more than 100 yuan. The old man told me with gratitude: "When it was first liberated, the People's Liberation Army sent people to deliver meals three times a day, with eggs in every meal, and my body recovered quickly. Later, I was always taken care of by the government, and now I have the fishing cooperative providing food, so why should I worry about life!" Filled with joy, he took out his bank deposit book, which showed that he had deposited more than 90 yuan in May of this year.
    The other members of the fishing cooperative are all immigrants from the mainland. Today, the following saying is popular among them: "When we came, we wore old clothes, now we wear woolen sweaters." This is a vivid portrayal of their lives. He Zhaocai was originally a farmer from Haimen. He got a leg disease when he went out to sea to fish in his early years, which affected his labor force. Later, he returned to the mainland to farm, and his family lived a very hard life. He had not made new clothes for more than ten years and was still in debt for more than 200 yuan. After coming to Dachen last year, he received more than 590 yuan in one winter fishing season, paid off all his old debts, made three sets of clothes for himself, and his whole family added new clothes and quilts and bought government bonds. His life has changed greatly, and his relatives and friends are happy for him. When I met him, he was taking advantage of the fishing slack to add a new kitchen to his house. When I congratulated him on his happy life, he was very excited and told me that he would send his son, who had been out of school for many years, to the newly built elementary school to study in the second half of the year. At his home, I met an old man named Xi Zhoujian, who often interrupted He Zhaocai's speech to talk about his own life. He is sixty-seven years old this year. In the past, he made a living by selling water on the mainland, earning at most three or four jiao a day. After coming to Dachen to join the fishing cooperative, he made a net profit of more than 400 yuan in the winter fishing season. The old man excitedly told me that he had also made new clothes and cotton robes and had saved 40 yuan. I asked him with a smile if he still wanted to go back to the mainland to sell water. He happily said that his wish was to participate in fishery production in Dachen forever, but if the original people of Dachen came back and the government wanted him to move back, he would of course go back.
    In fact, Dachen Island does not want them to go back anymore. Dachen Island needs more people to build it. The members of the "Wenzhou Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team" are the bold builders and courageous creators of a new life. These two hundred young people, the oldest being twenty-seven or eight years old and the youngest only fourteen or fifteen years old, most of them had just stepped out of the school gates not long ago and have now plunged into a grand crucible of life. The beautiful ideals and strong will of the young people have made difficulties give way to them one by one. The typhoons that are common on the island blow so hard that people cannot stand up, but they never stop insisting on reclaiming land and planting trees on the mountains; stepping on the mountain slopes where no roads can be found, they carry fertilizer in baskets to the mountainside. Sometimes the baskets are blown down by the wind and covered in manure, but they do not flinch. After half a year of training, they can all carry loads of around 100 jin over mountains and ridges. Their weight has generally increased by five or six jin to twenty jin. The team members engaged in animal husbandry proudly regard this industry as a new cause for building Dachen Island, and closely link it with the future prospects of Dachen. The rolling hills and fertile pastures on the island have made them see the broad prospects for the development of animal husbandry. The members of the fishing team are all particularly strong young men. Half a year ago, it was difficult for them to truly imagine what the ocean was like. When they first started on the fishing boats, they were so seasick that they could not eat for several days. But after a spring fishing season of practice, they have now initially mastered the skills of fishing. Individual team members have been able to become "leaders" and lead fishing boats out to sea.
    How happy and fortunate people are when they enjoy the fruits of their labor! After several months of hard work, they have now tasted the potatoes, vegetables, tomatoes... that they have sown and cultivated with their own hands. Now sweet potatoes and peanuts are being planted next, and a bountiful autumn harvest awaits them again. Cattle, sheep, pigs, and other livestock have also recently given birth to their new generation, and the team members are building new livestock sheds and opening up new pastures. They plan to have cattle and sheep running all over the mountains and valleys on Shang and Xia Dachen and the surrounding islands in the near future, supplying the people of the motherland with a large amount of fat milk and meat.
    Life is changing the face of Dachen every day. The school buildings of the elementary school are about to be built, and more than fifty school-age children will enter their paradise in the autumn. The new factory buildings of the fish processing plant have been laid down and will be completed and put into larger-scale production when the winter fishing season arrives. In addition, in order to meet the cultural life aspirations of tens of thousands of fishermen from all over the country during the fishing season, a "Fishermen's Club" that can accommodate more than a thousand people is also planned to be built. The responsible comrades of the Dachen Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party showed me a picture of Dachen Island next year: all the existing production cooperatives and the youth reclamation team on the island will be merged to form a large-scale production cooperative. Two more large motorized sailing boats will be put into fishery production. Power plants will also be built to create conditions for the establishment and development of the fish and milk and meat processing industries. At that time, we will see a newer and more beautiful face of Dachen Island. (Attached picture)

    大陈岛上的新生活
    钟敬文
    如果你曾经从一年半以前所拍摄的纪录影片“解放大陈岛”和“大陈的灾难”中，对大陈岛的荒凉破败的景状留下了深刻印象的话，那末，现在再来看看大陈岛今天的面貌，就会给你另一种完全不同的印象。今天，生活不但在岛上复活，并且出现了欣欣向荣的和平繁荣的景象。
    在上大陈，曾经被破坏殆尽的废墟上，已经出现了一排排崭新的平房。在原来居民集中的下大陈，也是遭劫最惨的地方，一年多来已被守卫海防的驻军陆续修复了一千多间民房。被劫居民留下的财产，都经人民政府挨户清理予以保管。一年中，驻军战士们已将岛上触目皆是的成堆垃圾清除干净。
    在大陈随处可以见到各种不同职业的新居民，他们都是从大陆来到这里进行各种生产和建设的劳动人民。其中多是农民和渔民，现在岛上成立了两个农业社和一个渔业社。此外，还有为数不少的建筑工人和搬运工人。最引人注目的是二百多个小伙子和年青姑娘组成的“温州青年志愿垦荒队”，他们的出现，给这个古老的、曾经一度死寂的大陈岛带来了无限的青春和活力。
    随着生活的要求，这里很早就设立了供销合作社、邮电局、书店、银行等近十个国营企业的营业机构。现在又从大陆迁来了饭馆、食品店、零售代销店、缝纫社和理发店等各种服务性的行业。过去大陈居民在夏秋两季，因久旱缺水，饮水常常发生困难。今年战士们在短时间里修复了两座大水库，水库中已经积满了碧澄的清泉，等待即将来临的干旱时期，供给全体居民饮用。在上下大陈一片肥沃的土地上，部队战士和垦荒队员们已将全国各地送来的各种花木种子和成万棵果苗栽种起来。岛上出现了不少精美的小花园。在山岗上或公路边，都可看到一棵棵幼嫩的树苗，在海风熏育下渐渐茁壮起来。
    大陈像祖国沿海无数个岛屿一样，是一个美丽可爱的海岛。尤其值得称道的，还在于它是我国东海最大的渔场之一。这个渔场的总面积有一万多平方公里。一年四季出产大量的黄鱼、墨鱼、鳗鱼和带鱼等各种鱼类。以前这里的渔民把它称为自己的“粮仓”，今天来到大陈的人都亲昵地叫它为“祖国的宝岛”。一解放，这里的渔业生产就恢复了，全年的总产量达到了十七万四千余担。最近我刚来大陈时，人们就争相谈述不久前刚结束的春季墨鱼汛的盛况：大陈洋中丰富的鱼群，吸引来了宁波、舟山、温岭以及福建等地二十个县的两万多渔民。七千多只渔船聚集在各个港口，销售渔产，购买生活用品，使大陈岛变得空前的繁荣。从小在大陈捕鱼的王守鉴说：“我今年六十四岁，打从我十几岁能记事的时候起，从来也没有过今年这次渔汛的热闹”。今年春汛中，光是大陈渔业社就捕获了三千四百担鲜鱼。
    随着生产的发展，这里渔民的生活正在迅速地改变。大陈渔业社在去年冬汛中，每户的平均收入，比1954年增加了三倍多。大陈解放时，被我军从孤岛上救回的老渔民王守鉴和他的儿子王其昌，去年参加了合作社，在冬汛四个月中就分得了一千六百多元。两人买了毛线衣，做了新衣，儿子买了手表，又在银行存了八百元，至今还没曾动用。另一个在敌人逃跑时病得奄奄一息，被解放军从垂死中救活的老人孔江波，今年八十一岁了，他从去年起就由渔业社包养，生活过得很愉快。老人自己不甘闲逸，还帮助社里作些零活。冬汛期中，他一个人担任了替外地渔民“蒸网”的副业生产，分到了一百多元。老人怀着感激的心情告诉我：“刚解放时，解放军每天派人送来三次饭，每顿都有鸡蛋，身体很快就调养好了。后来一直受政府的照顾，现在又有渔业社供吃，生活还用愁吗！”他内心充满着喜悦，一边说一边拿出了银行的存折，上面写着他在今年五月间，存储了九十元余款。
    渔业社的其他社员都是大陆来的移民，今天在他们中间普遍流行着这样的话：“来时穿旧衣片，现在穿毛线衫”，这是他们对自己生活的形象的写照。何兆才原是海门的农民，早年出海捕鱼时得了腿疾，影响了劳动力。后来回大陆种田，一家生活很苦，十多年没做过新衣，还负债二百多元。去年来大陈后，一个冬汛中分得了五百九十多元，全部还清了旧债，自己做了三套衣服，全家都添置了新衣新被，还买了公债。生活大大变了样子，亲友们都为他高兴。我遇见他时，他正趁渔闲在给自己添盖新厨房。当我祝贺他的幸福生活时，他十分振奋，告诉我下半年就要送失学多年的儿子上新建的小学读书。在他家里，碰到了一个名叫奚周鉴的老人，他时常打断何兆才的说话，谈述自己的生活。他今年六十七岁，过去在大陆以卖水度日，每天最多挣到三四角钱。来大陈参加渔业社后，冬汛中净得四百多元。老汉兴奋地告诉我，他也做了新衣棉袍，还存了四十元。我笑着问他是否还想回大陆去卖水，他愉快地表示：自己的愿望是永远在大陈参加渔业生产，但如果大陈原来的老百姓回来后，政府要他再搬回去的话，他当然回去的。
    其实，大陈岛并不希望他们再回去了。大陈岛需要更多的人来建设它。“温州青年志愿垦荒队”的队员们就是新生活的豪迈的建设者和勇敢的创造者。这二百多个年青人，大的二十七、八岁，最小的才十四、五岁，绝大部分人在不久前刚刚跨出了学校的门槛，现在已投入了一座宏大的生活的炼炉。年青人美丽的理想和坚强的意志，使困难一个一个地在他们的面前让开了路。海岛上常有的台风，吹得人站不起身来，他们从不间断地在山上坚持垦荒，植树；踏着找不出路的山坡，把肥料一担担地运送到半山腰上。有时被风吹倒了担子，粪肥沾满在身上，也没有畏缩。经过半年的锻炼，他们大都能挑着一百斤上下的担子爬山越岭。体重普遍增加了五、六斤到二十斤。从事牧畜的队员们把这门行业自豪地看成为建设大陈岛的新事业，把它和大陈未来的远景紧紧连系在一起，岛上起伏的山丘和肥美的牧草使他们看到了牧畜业发展的广大前途。渔业队的队员们都是体格特别壮实的小伙子，半年以前他们还难以真切地想像海洋是个什么样子，他们开始到渔船上的时候，晕得几天吃不下饭。但一个春汛的实习以后，现已初步掌握了捕鱼的本领。个别队员已能够当“老大”，领着渔船出海了。
    当人们享受到自己劳动的果实的时候，是多么愉快和幸福啊！经过几个月的辛勤劳动，现在他们已经尝到了自己亲手播种和培育起来的马铃薯、青菜、番茄……。现在番薯和花生紧接着种下了，一个丰产的秋收又在等待着他们。牛、羊、猪等家畜最近也产下了它们新的一代，队员们又在修建新的畜舍，开辟新的牧场。他们计划在不久的将来，要使上下大陈及周围岛屿上跑着满山满谷的牛羊，向祖国人民供应大量肥美的乳、肉。
    生活使大陈天天改变着自己的面貌。小学校的房舍已将着手修建，五十多个学龄儿童将在秋季进入自己的乐园。鱼类加工厂的新厂房已打好地基，在冬汛到来时将完工投入规模更大的生产。此外，为了满足汛期中来自各方的数万渔民的文化生活的愿望，还准备新建一座可容千余人的“渔民俱乐部”。中共大陈工委的负责同志在我面前展示了一幅明年大陈岛的图画：全岛现有各生产社与青年垦荒队将合并成立一个大型生产合作社。还有两艘大机帆船投入渔业生产。发电厂也要随着建设起来，为鱼类和乳、肉的加工工业的建立和发展创立条件。那时，我们将看到大陈岛出现更新更美丽的面貌。（附图片）
