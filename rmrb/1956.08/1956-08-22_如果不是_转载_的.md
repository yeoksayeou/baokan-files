    If it wasn't "reprinted"...
    Liu Heng
    That day at nine o'clock in the morning, Comrade Li of the security section of the Baotou branch of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation was working in his office. Suddenly, the door burst open, and two flustered people rushed in. As soon as they entered, they shouted:
    "Old Li, hurry and take a look, there's a reactionary slogan at the Third Canteen!"
    Comrade Li immediately became nervous. He locked the door and went with the two to the canteen.
    It turned out that there was a cartoon posted on the wall of the Third Canteen:
    Some units' employee canteens include all expenses in the cost of meals and even make a profit.
    Before Comrade Li and the others arrived, the cartoon was already surrounded by employees. Moreover, there was quite a debate among the employees.
    One group said, "This drawing is really good, the food in our canteen is indeed too expensive!"
    Another group said, "The food is expensive because prices are high in Baotou. How can you say it's because the canteen has to hand over so many fees? I think this drawing is a reactionary element spreading rumors and slandering our new society!"
    One group said, "It's true that prices are high in Baotou, but doesn't our canteen have to hand over 8.5% of welfare fees every month? How can you blame people for spreading rumors and slander?"
    Another group said, "Of course—but, if you have an opinion, you should raise it openly, you can't secretly post a picture, incite the workers, and attack the administrative leaders. Wouldn't that become posting reactionary slogans?"
    The two groups were arguing around the cartoon when they suddenly saw the people from the security section coming and quickly made way.
    Comrade Li walked up to the cartoon and looked at it carefully, front, back, left, right, up and down, several times. In the end, his eyes, being trained in security work, were keen. He found a line of small characters under the cartoon that everyone had missed: "Reprinted from 'Cartoon' magazine, issue 65, 'Eat!' by Ye Chunyang"
    Comrade Li told everyone about his discovery, and the heatedly arguing people stopped arguing because, from this line of small characters, they had naturally drawn a conclusion:
    "This drawing was not created by our own employees, it was reprinted from a magazine in Beijing. Of course, it's not a reactionary slogan!"
    So, the people watching the drawing gradually dispersed. Comrade Li had a false alarm and went back.
    However, readers can't help but ask:
    "If this cartoon was not reprinted from a Beijing magazine, but was created by the employees of the Baotou branch of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation, then would it be a reactionary slogan?"

    如果不是“转载”的……
    刘衡
    那天上午九点钟，鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司包头分公司保卫处李同志正在房子里办公。突然，房门一响，进来了两个慌慌张张的人。他们一进门就叫：
    “老李，赶快去看看，第三食堂出现了反动标语！”
    李同志心里顿时紧张起来。他锁上门，跟两人一块儿去了。
    原来在第三食堂的墙上，贴了这样一张漫画：
    有些单位的职工食堂一切开支都算到伙食成本里，还要赚一笔利润。
    在李同志等赶来之前，漫画跟前，已经被职工们围满了。而且在职工们中间，还发生了不小的争论。
    一派说：“这画画得真叫好，咱们食堂的饭菜确实太贵了！”
    另一派说：“饭菜贵是因为包头物价高，哪里是因为食堂要上缴那么多费？我看呀，这画是反动分子在造谣污蔑咱们新社会！”
    一派说：“包头物价高虽然是事实，可是，咱们食堂每月不是还要上缴8.5％的福利费吗？怎么能怪人家是造谣污蔑？”
    另一派说：“这个，当然——可是，有意见就该正面提，总不能偷着贴一张画，煽动工人，打击行政领导。这不就变成乱贴反动标语了吗？”
    两派人正围着漫画争论不休，忽然看见保卫处的人过来了，赶紧闪开一条小道。
    李同志走到漫画跟前，把漫画前后左右上上下下看了好几遍。到底还是做保卫工作的人眼睛仔细，他在漫画下边发见了一行大家没有注意的小字：“转载自‘漫画’杂志第六十五期叶春暘作‘吃吧’”
    李同志把他的发见告诉大家，热烈争论的人们都不再争论了，因为从这一行小字，他们已经自自然然地得出了结论：
    “这画不是咱们职工自己创作的，是从北京的杂志上转载下来的。它当然不会是反动标语！”
    于是，看画的人们逐渐走散。李同志受了一场虚惊，也回去了。
    可是，读者们禁不住要发问：
    “如果这幅漫画不是转载北京杂志的，而是鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司包头分公司职工们自己创作的，那么，它究竟是不是反动标语？”
