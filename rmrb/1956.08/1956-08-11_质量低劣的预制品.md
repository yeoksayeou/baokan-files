    Poor Quality Precast Products
    Li Qian
    Not long ago, I visited the Third Engineering Section of the Northwest Second Engineering Company and saw that three factory buildings in this engineering section were missing a roof panel, as if they had skylights. Although some of the roof panels of nearby houses were installed, there were no expansion joints left between the two roof panels. In the First Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Section, many double-hole hollow floor slabs that had already been installed were also crooked and uneven.
    This phenomenon is caused by the poor quality and non-standard precast components produced by the old factory of the Northwest Second Engineering Company's Precast Factory (this factory is divided into two parts, according to the order in which they were put into production, the old factory and the new factory). They made the roof panels larger than the design specifications, and the workers had to try their best to squeeze them in during installation, and the expansion joints that should have been left were squeezed out; some were still not able to fit after the expansion joints were squeezed out, so they had to temporarily open a skylight on the roof. Sometimes the precast factory also makes the precast components much smaller than the specified size; the workers of Zhao Guodong's youth commando team, who were responsible for the installation task of the No. 8 project, once nearly fell off the second floor with the floor slab because a double-hole hollow floor slab was 20 centimeters short, and the two ends could not reach the wall. The precast components produced by this precast factory also have serious cracking problems. According to statistics, from the time it was put into production in October last year to mid-May this year, a total of 8,652 large roof panels were produced. In addition to the cracks that occurred after the engineering sections took them back, 133 defective and substandard products were left in the factory due to cracks; of the more than 23,000 double-hole hollow floor slabs they produced, nearly 2,000 could not be shipped out of the factory due to cracks and other reasons. In May of this year, this factory processed 1,500 double-hole hollow floor slabs for the Second Engineering Section of the Third Engineering Section, and 80% of them had cracks; in order to ensure the progress of the project, they had to reinforce the cracked floor slabs with steel bars, wasting more than 5 tons of steel and a lot of manpower, costing more than 3,000 yuan, and delaying the construction period by one month.
    The poor quality of the products of the Second Company's Precast Factory is primarily because the leading personnel have the mistaken idea of simply pursuing quantity and neglecting quality. Every time they assign tasks, they only mention the number of products to be produced, and never seriously conduct technical briefings or put forward quality requirements; when checking the completion of the plan, they only look at the quantity completed, and do not check the quality; they do not check or deal with quality accidents; sometimes they even praise those groups that produce a large quantity of products with poor quality. This has prompted many workers to simply pursue quantity and neglect quality.
    When this precast factory was first established last year, the precast components produced had many cracks. The Northwest Second Engineering Company once sent the director of the production department and engineers to help them find out the cause of the many cracks, formulated steam curing operating procedures, used the Soviet advanced experience of "steam closed curing method," and established a temperature measurement team, which significantly improved product quality and saved a lot of steam. However, not long after the inspection team returned to the company, the steam closed curing method was discarded, and the three cadres of the temperature measurement team were transferred to do other work, leaving only a few workers. The temperature measurement records they painstakingly made were not even looked at. Because the leading personnel did not pay attention to the temperature measurement team, the workers of other types of work often did not operate according to the opinions of the workers of the temperature measurement team, which also caused many defective products.
    Chaotic systems and lack of responsibility are also important reasons for the poor product quality of this precast factory. There are no handover and acceptance systems in the workshops of this factory, and no one cares about the substandard products produced by the workers; due to the imperfect system, even if quality problems are inspected, it is not easy to distinguish responsibility. This factory has more than 40 steam curing pools, and the time should be calculated very scientifically to arrange the demolding and mixing work, but the workshop director and engineer do not care about this matter. As a result, sometimes more than 40 pools are cured, and the form workers are busy working overtime, while the concrete workers have nothing to do; after the wooden forms are removed, the form workers are idle, and the concrete workers start to rush to complete their tasks. Sometimes, in order to reduce idleness or overtime, the form workers remove the forms in advance, which results in many cracks. In addition, this factory does not have a fixed location for stacking finished products, nor does it place them separately according to different specifications. Instead, they are stacked together regardless of size and quality, and when picking up goods, they rummage through the component pile randomly. After being turned back and forth, the ones without cracks also developed cracks, and the small cracks became larger.
    Due to the poor quality of the products of the Second Company's Precast Factory, many construction sites and construction units have raised objections. When the inspection team composed of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau and the Northwest Second Engineering Company and other units came to the factory for inspection, the leaders of the factory did not actively cooperate with the inspection team to clarify the problems in order to improve the work, but adopted a hands-off attitude with resistance.
    The Northwest Second Engineering Company should specifically help them recognize their mistakes and quickly reverse the phenomenon of poor product quality.

### 质量低劣的预制品

    质量低劣的预制品
    李茜
    不久以前，我曾到西北第二工程公司第三工区参观，看到这个工区有三座厂房的房顶上都差一块屋面板，好像开了天窗一样。附近有些房子的屋面板虽然安装起来了，但是两个屋面板之间没有留出伸缩缝来。在第四工区第一工段，许多已经安装起来的双孔空心楼板，也是七歪八扭，高低不平。
    这种现象是西北第二工程公司预制厂老厂（这个厂分两部分，按投入生产的先后分老厂、新厂）生产的预制构件质量低劣、不合规格所造成的。他们把屋面板做得比设计规定的尺寸大，工人安装的时候只好想尽办法把它挤进去，应留的伸缩缝就被挤掉了；有的挤掉伸缩缝以后还是放不下，只好在房顶上暂时开个天窗。预制厂有时又把预制构件做得比规定的尺寸小很多；担任八号工程安装任务的赵国栋青年突击队的工人，有一次就因为一块双孔空心楼板短了二十公分，两头搭不到墙身上，险些儿连人带楼板一起从二层楼上跌下来。这个预制厂生产的预制构件，裂纹现象也很严重。据统计，从去年十月份投入生产到今年五月中旬止，共生产大型屋面板八千六百五十二块，除各工区领回以后发生裂纹的以外，因为裂纹而留在厂内的废品、次品就有一百三十三块；他们生产的两万三千多块双孔空心楼板，因为裂纹等原因不能出厂的有将近两千块。今年五月份这个厂给第三工区第二工段加工一千五百块双孔空心楼板，80％都有裂纹；为了保证工程进度，只得把裂纹的楼板用钢筋重新加固，浪费了五吨多钢材和很多人工，花了三千多元，还拖延了一个月的工期。
    二公司预制厂产品质量低劣，首先是因为领导人员存在着单纯追求数量、忽视质量的错误思想。他们每次布置任务的时候，都只是把要求生产的数字说一下，从来没有认真进行过技术交底和提出质量要求；检查计划完成情况的时候，也只是单纯看完成数量多少，而不检查质量；出了质量事故，也不检查处理；有时候甚至还表扬那些产品质量不好而生产数量多的小组。这样，就促使许多工人也单纯追求数量，忽视质量。
    去年这个预制厂刚刚成立的时候，生产出的预制构件裂纹很多。西北第二工程公司曾经派生产处处长和工程师等人帮助他们找出了裂纹多的原因，制定了蒸汽养护操作规程，运用了苏联先进经验“蒸汽密闭式养护法”，还成立了测温小组，使产品质量有显著提高，也节约了很多蒸汽。但是，检查组回公司不久，蒸汽密闭式养护法就被扔在一边，测温小组的三个干部都被抽调去做其他的工作，只剩下几个工人。他们费尽心机搞的测温纪录也没有人看。由于领导人员对测温小组不重视，其他工种的工人就往往不根据测温小组工人的意见操作，因此也造成了不少次品。
    制度混乱，无人负责，也是这个预制厂产品质量低劣的重要原因之一。这个厂各车间都没有交接和验收制度，工人生产出不合规格的产品没有人过问；由于制度不健全，有时对质量问题进行了检查，也不容易分清责任。这个厂共有四十多个蒸汽养护池子，本来应该很科学地计算时间，把拆模和捣制的工作安排好，但是车间主任和工程师都不管这件事。结果有时候四十多个池子都养护好了，模工忙得加班加点，混凝土工没有事干；等把木模拆完了，模工窝工，混凝土工又开始赶任务。有时候，模工为了少窝工或少加班，就提前拆模，结果便造成不少裂纹。另外，这个厂堆放成品既没有固定地点，也不按照不同规格分别放置，而是大小好坏堆在一起，取货的时候就在构件堆里乱翻乱找。经过来回翻动，没有裂纹的也发生了裂纹，裂纹小的变大了。
    由于二公司预制厂产品质量太坏，很多工地和建设单位都提出过意见。当西北工程管理总局和西北第二工程公司等单位组成检查组到厂里来检查的时候，厂的领导人员不是主动地配合检查组共同搞清问题，以便改进工作，而是带着抵触情绪，采取了袖手旁观的态度。
    西北第二工程公司应该具体帮助他们认识错误，迅速扭转产品质量低劣的现象。
