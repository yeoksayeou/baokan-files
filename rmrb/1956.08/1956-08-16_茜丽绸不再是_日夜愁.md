    Celanese Silk is No Longer a "Day and Night Worry"
    Heng Jun
    The quality of Celanese silk produced by silk weaving factories in Suzhou has greatly improved.

    Celanese silk is a high-grade rayon fabric. The front side is comparable to fine worsted, and the reverse side is as soft as feather yarn, making it the most ideal clothing material for middle-aged men and women in the summer.

    Suzhou's silk weaving factories only began weaving Celanese silk after liberation. In recent years, the quality has been unstable. Last year, due to export needs, the production volume increased significantly, and the percentage of first-class products declined sharply. In January and February of this year, the percentage of first-class Celanese silk was only 28%. Shortly before the Spring Festival, the news that only one out of two hundred rolls of Celanese silk inspected by the Shanghai Silk Company was a first-class product spread to Suzhou like a bucket of cold water, chilling the leading cadres of the factories producing Celanese silk from head to toe. Some people said, "More than a dozen measures, many methods, but the quality still can't be improved." At that time, Celanese silk truly became a "day and night worry."

    At the first representative assembly of the Suzhou Municipal Silk Weaving Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in late March, right-leaning conservative ideas of factory leaders who failed to see or support advanced practices were criticized. Some Party members criticized the leaders, saying, "The leaders only shout about improving quality but don't act, and they don't discuss it with everyone." The heads of the various enterprises also stated at the meeting, "We will definitely find a way to improve the quality of Celanese silk."

    After the meeting, the factories hired experts, technicians, and experienced veteran workers to jointly analyze the characteristics of Celanese silk and identify the reasons for the poor quality: on the one hand, poor raw materials and outdated machinery, and on the other hand, chaotic operations and backward management. They then identified the main key issues and reasons for defects in each department and for each problem, and formulated specific measures based on these reasons. Each factory organized dedicated personnel to conduct a comprehensive and detailed sorting of raw materials, dividing them into five categories and eighteen types, distinguishing between white, yellow, ochre, black, coarse, soft, hard, etc. Based on these characteristics, they carried out selection, batching, grading, and used them on dedicated spindles and machines, thus ensuring the consistency of each batch of Celanese silk raw materials. In the past, finished products were only sent to the Shanghai Silk Company for inspection, and by the time problems were detected, it was already "water under the bridge" and could not guarantee quality at all. Now, each factory has established its own inspection organization to keep track of the quality situation in a timely manner.

    In April, the Suzhou Municipal Silk Weaving Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized more than 30 Party committee secretaries, factory directors, technicians, and advanced producers to visit silk weaving factories in Hangzhou. They also signed a contract in Hangzhou for silk weaving factories in Suzhou and Hangzhou to carry out competitions for the same products. Immediately afterwards, each factory sent people to other factories to learn advanced operating methods, and at the same time summarized the advanced experience of their own factories. For example, Liu Shunlong from Guangming Silk Weaving Factory and Zhu Chaozhong from Xin Su Silk Weaving Factory consistently maintained first-class product rates of around 60% to 80%. The leadership wrote down their experiences in plain language and organized other workers to learn. The workers saw that the leadership style was different from before, and they were very determined to improve quality and their enthusiasm also increased. When implementing various inspection responsibility systems, they put forward slogans such as "Everyone takes responsibility, check layer by layer, and don't let substandard products pass" and "Substandard products return to their origin." In May, the percentage of first-class Celanese silk had already increased to about 85%, and individual factories had increased to over 95%. The factories have already turned around the situation of failing to complete quality targets and are striving to make Celanese silk a "first-class" rayon fabric.

### 茜丽绸不再是“日夜愁”

    茜丽绸不再是“日夜愁”
    亨俊
    苏州市各丝织厂生产的茜丽绸质量大有改善。
    茜丽绸是一种高级的人造丝织品，正面可以同凡立丁比美，反面像羽纱那样柔软，是中年男女夏天最理想的衣料。
    苏州市各丝织厂，解放后才开始织造茜丽绸。这几年质量一直不稳定；去年由于外销需要，织造数量大大增加，正品率更直线下降。今年一、二月份，茜丽绸的正品率只有28％。春节前夕，在上海丝绸公司检验的二百匹茜丽绸，只有一匹是正品的消息传到苏州，像一盆凉水，把生产茜丽绸各厂的领导干部浇得从头冷到脚。有人说“措施十几条，办法木老老（苏南俗语，“多”的意思），质量提不高”。那时候，茜丽绸真成了“日夜愁”。
    在三月下旬，中共苏州市丝织委员会第一次代表大会上，集中批判了各厂领导上看不到先进、不支持先进的右倾保守思想。有的党员批评领导说“领导上对提高质量是光喊不做，不同大家商量”，各企业的负责人也在会上表示“一定想办法提高茜丽绸质量”。
    会后，各厂聘请了专家、技术人员和老年工人共同分析茜丽绸的特点，找出质量不好的原因：一方面是原料不好、机械陈旧、另一方面是操作混乱，管理落后。他们又找出每一个部门，每一个问题的主要关键和出次品的原因，根据这些原因作出具体措施。各厂组织了专人负责将原料进行全面细致的排队，分出五种十八样，辨别出白、黄、赭、黑、粗、软、硬……等特点，根据这些特点进行挑剔、分批、分档、专锭、专机使用，这样就使每批茜丽绸原料保持一致。过去织出成品才拿到上海丝绸公司检验，等检查出问题已经成了“马后炮”了，根本不能保证质量。现在各厂都建立了自己的检验组织，及时掌握质量情况。
    四月份，中共苏州市丝织委员会，组织了三十多名党委书记、厂长、技术人员和先进生产者到杭州市各丝织厂参观。并在杭州签订了苏、杭两地丝织厂开展同品种竞赛合同。紧接着各厂一面派人去其他厂学习先进操作法，一面总结本厂先进经验，如光明丝织厂刘顺龙，新苏丝织厂朱潮忠，他们的正品率一直在60％到80％左右，领导上便把他们的经验，用通俗易懂的语言写出来，组织别的工人学习。工人们看见领导作风同以前不同了，改善质量的决心很大，劲头也大了。在贯彻各项检查责任制的时候，他们提出了“人人把关、层层检查，不让次品过关”和“次品回娘家”的口号。五月份茜丽绸的正品率已经提高到85％左右，个别厂提高到95％以上，各厂已经转变了完不成质量指标的局面，正为争取让茜丽绸成为“第一流”的人造丝织品而奋斗。
