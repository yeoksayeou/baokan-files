    PLA Troops Stationed in Nanjing Vigorously Support Suburban Cooperatives

    (Our Newspaper News) The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Nanjing are vigorously supporting agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanjing. They have established fixed ties with eighteen agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs, including October and Xuanwu.

    In the first half of this year, the troops stationed in Nanjing used their holidays and rest time to provide voluntary labor for the cooperatives. They dispatched over 62,000 personnel-times, built the Sino-Military Friendship Reservoir at the foot of Zijin Mountain, constructed embankments and dug ponds for more than 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and helped farmers reclaim more than 240 mu of wasteland. During the heavy rains this year, many officers and soldiers went to the countryside to help farmers rush to harvest wheat.

    Many officers and soldiers also used their savings to buy farm tools for the cooperatives. There were as many as fourteen double-wheeled double-furrow plows, nine firewood trucks and large carts, and one 100-horsepower water pump. The officers and soldiers stationed in Nanjing have donated more than 820,000 yuan as a fund for the national troops to raise funds to establish thirty tractor stations.

    In February this year, General Xu Shiyou, General Tang Liang, and others visited the October Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs. They had cordial conversations with the cadres, families of martyrs and soldiers, demobilized soldiers, elderly members, and advanced producers in the cooperative, and gave the cooperative material support. In the past six months, the troops stationed in Nanjing have donated a complete set of telephone equipment to two agricultural cooperatives including October, helped one agricultural cooperative establish a health clinic, and helped agricultural cooperatives establish three clubs and a library, donating more than 16,000 books. The troops also often invite and send people to show movies to the farmers, establishing a close friendship with them.

    解放军驻南京部队大力支援郊区合作社
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻南京部队大力支援南京郊区农业合作社。他们已分别同郊区的十月、玄武等十八个农业生产合作社建立了固定联系。
    今年上半年驻宁部队利用假期和休息时间，为合作社进行义务劳动，他们先后出动六万二千多人次，在紫金山下修建了军民友谊水库，修堤、挖塘二万多土方，又帮助农民开荒二百四十多亩。今年暴雨期间更有许多官兵下乡帮助农民抢收小麦。
    许多官兵还把节省下来的钱购买农具送给合作社。仅双轮双铧犁就有十四部，运柴车和大车九辆和一部一百马力的抽水机。驻南京部队官兵已捐献了八十二万多元，作为全国部队集资建立三十个拖拉机站的基金。
    今年二月，许世友上将、唐亮上将等访问了郊区的十月农业社，他们和社内的干部、烈、军属、复员军人、老年社员和先进生产者进行了亲切的交谈，并给合作社以物质上的支持。近半年来，驻南京部队曾经赠给十月等二个农业社全套电话设备，帮助一个农业社建立了卫生所，并帮助农业社建立了三个俱乐部，一个图书馆，赠书一万六千多册。部队还经常邀请和派人放电影给农民看。同农民建立了亲密的友谊。
