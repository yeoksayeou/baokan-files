Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from London: British military authorities on July 31st ordered British armed forces stationed domestically and in the Mediterranean region to enter a state of "alert" so as to "take immediate action" in the event of "violent incidents" regarding the Suez Canal issue.

According to information already revealed by Western news agencies, British naval units at both ends of the Suez Canal, in the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean, have been ordered to be on alert. Some British naval personnel have been recalled to their ships for "duty," and a heavy aircraft carrier, the "Eagle," sailed to Cyprus on the 31st.

Prior to this, a British naval spokesman in Valletta, Malta, said that British warships en route from the Eastern Mediterranean to Malta had been diverted to Cyprus, and a cruiser and a minelayer had also arrived in Cypriot waters.

The British War Office has also ordered British ground forces to enter a state of alert. The British Air Force has also received orders to prepare to airlift troops to the Middle East.

United Press International reports that these British actions were taken after obtaining tacit approval from the United States in the initial stages of the Three-Power talks.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from London: The Anglo-French-American talks, originally scheduled to continue on July 31st, were adjourned to await the arrival of US Secretary of State Dulles to participate in the discussions.

Dulles departed for London on the afternoon of July 31st. He decided to attend the talks after a ninety-minute conversation with Eisenhower regarding Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal.

An Associated Press report commented that Dulles's trip to London indicated that the Three-Power talks had reached an important stage. The report said that the United States supported the British and French proposal to hold an international conference to formulate rules for the management of the Suez Canal, but there were still some "differences" of opinion between the United States and Britain and France on specific approaches.

    取得美国默许之后
    英国对埃及进行军事恫吓
    杜勒斯已去伦敦会商干涉埃及的计划
    据新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国军方在七月三十一日下令驻在国内和地中海地区的英国武装部队进入“戒备状态”，以便在苏彝士运河问题上发生“暴力事件”的时候“立即采取行动”。
    据西方通讯社已经透露的消息，在苏彝士运河两端的红海和东地中海的英国海军单位已经奉命戒备，一些英国海军人员已经被召回他们的舰上“值勤”，而且一艘重型航空母舰“鹰号”也已经在三十一日开到塞浦路斯。
    在这以前，马耳他岛瓦里塔的一位英国海军发言人说，从东地中海开往马耳他岛途中的英国军舰已经转调到塞浦路斯岛去，另外有一艘巡洋舰和一艘布雷舰也都到了塞浦路斯岛海面。
    英国陆军部也已经命令英国地面部队进入戒备状态。英国的空军也接到了准备空运部队到中东去的命令。
    合众社的消息指出，英国的这些行动是在三国会谈的前一阶段取得了美国的默许之后采取的。
    据新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：原定在七月三十一日继续进行的英法美三国会谈，因为等待美国国务卿杜勒斯来参加讨论，宣告休会。
    杜勒斯已经在七月三十一日下午动身来伦敦。他是在同艾森豪威尔就埃及收回苏彝士运河问题进行九十分钟的谈话以后决定来参加会谈的。
    美联社的一条消息评论说：杜勒斯的伦敦之行表明三国会谈已经达到一个重要阶段。消息说，美国是支持英、法两国的关于举行一个国际会议来制订管理苏彝士运河规则的主张的，不过在具体做法上，美国同英法两国还有一些“分歧”的意见。
