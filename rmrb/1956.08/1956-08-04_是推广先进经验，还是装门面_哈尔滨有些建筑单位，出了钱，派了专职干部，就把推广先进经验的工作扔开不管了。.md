Xinhua News Agency report: Some construction units in Harbin, after spending money and dispatching dedicated cadres, abandon the work of promoting advanced experience.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Tao Suqi reported: The Harbin Municipal Construction Engineering Company participated in the city-wide basic construction advanced experience performance and observation meeting in early July. They organized the bricklaying team of Yao Ruikai from their company to demonstrate Yang Changshi's advanced experience of bricklaying with a mortar spreader, which attracted the attention of the visitors. After the meeting, the Northeast Third Engineering Company sent people to learn this experience and borrow the mortar spreader several times, but they did not achieve their wishes. Instead, they discovered this strange thing: this team only performed for others at the performance meeting, but they did not use this experience themselves.

This phenomenon of treating the promotion of advanced experience as window dressing is not unique in Harbin. Some engineering companies organize batches of workers to go to other places to observe and learn advanced experience, but after these employees return, they go back to their original positions. The leadership has not effectively organized the exchange and promotion of the advanced experience they have learned. In the Northeast Third Engineering Company of Harbin, this year, over 90,000 yuan was allocated to various engineering offices for the trial production and experimentation of advanced experience in saving steel and cement, and no less than dozens of personnel were sent to various places to learn advanced experience. Twenty-eight dedicated personnel were also equipped to be responsible for promoting advanced experience, and 130,000 yuan was spent to purchase a large ball mill to manufacture alternative cement materials. With so much funding and manpower, in theory, the company's work in promoting advanced experience should be done well, but on the contrary, they put the large ball mill into the warehouse; the plan to use non-clinker cement and bamboo-reinforced concrete and other advanced experiences to save cement and steel this year has not been realized so far. The company's staff commented on the company's performance in promoting advanced experience in the first half of the year as: "Spent a lot of money, bustling and noisy, but the effect was not good."

In some engineering companies, there are also quite a few full-time staff promoting advanced experience, who should be said to be undertaking a glorious and pleasant job, but they often have feelings of depression. Promoting advanced experience should be the central work of the leadership and the responsibility of every employee. How can it be promoted by relying solely on a small number of full-time staff? An employee responsible for promoting advanced experience in the Fourth Engineering Office of the Northeast Third Engineering Company said: "My work in the past six months has been running errands, being verbose, and urging materials." The responsible personnel of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league of this engineering office rarely care about the promotion of advanced experience on weekdays. When the higher authorities hold meetings or understand the situation, someone comes to the staff promoting advanced experience, urging them to provide performance models, materials, figures, and information on the promotion of advanced experience.

It turns out that the leading staff of these companies believe that as long as they spend money and dispatch full-time staff, they are paying attention to the work of promoting advanced experience. In their daily work, they have not seriously and deeply conducted specific leadership, but only regard the promotion of advanced experience as something to decorate the facade, and they can only see their achievements in promoting advanced experience at technical performance meetings.

### 是推广先进经验，还是装门面  哈尔滨有些建筑单位，出了钱，派了专职干部，就把推广先进经验的工作扔开不管了。

    是推广先进经验，还是装门面
    哈尔滨有些建筑单位，出了钱，派了专职干部，就把推广先进经验的工作扔开不管了。
    新华社讯　新华社记者陶肃琦报道：哈尔滨市建筑工程公司在七月上旬参加了全市基本建设先进经验表演观摩大会，他们组织本公司的姚瑞凯瓦工小组表演了杨长诗的铺灰器砌砖先进经验，引起了参观者的注意。会后，东北第三工程公司几次派人到他们那里去学习这一经验和借用铺灰器，结果都没有达到愿望，反而发现了这样的怪事情：这个小组原来只是在表演会上给人家表演，自己却没有运用这个经验。
    这种把推广先进经验当成装门面的现象，在哈尔滨并不是唯一的。有些工程公司组织一批又一批的工人到外地去观摩学习先进经验，可是这些职工回来以后，就各返原位，领导上没有很好地组织交流和推广他们所学的先进经验。在哈尔滨市的东北第三工程公司，今年拨给各工程处推广节约钢材、水泥等先进经验的试制和试验费用达九万多元，派往各地学习先进经验的人员不下数十人，专门配备了负责推广先进经验的工作人员二十八人，还花了十三万元购置了一台大型球磨机，来制造代用水泥材料。用这样多的经费和人力，按理这个公司推广先进经验的工作应当做得好才是，但是恰恰相反，他们把大型球磨机放进了仓库；今年上半年原定采用无熟料水泥和竹筋混凝土等先进经验来节约水泥、钢材的计划，迄今没有实现。这个公司的工作人员给公司上半年推广先进经验的成绩作的评语是：“花钱不少，热热闹闹，效果不好”。
    在一些工程公司里，还有为数不少的专职推广先进经验的工作人员，应当说他们担当的是一种光荣而愉快的工作，可是他们都经常有苦闷情绪。推广先进经验，应当是领导的中心工作和每个职工的职责，单单依赖少数专职工作人员怎能推得动呢？东北第三工程公司第四工程处一个负责推广先进经验的工作人员说：“我半年来的工作是跑腿、饶舌、催材料。”这个工程处的党、政、工、团的负责工作人员平时很少关怀推广先进经验的情况。当上级开会，或者是了解情况的时候，才有人来找推广先进经验的工作人员，催要推广先进经验的表演典型、资料、数字和情况。
    原来这些公司的领导工作人员认为，只要出了钱、派了专职工作人员，就是重视推广先进经验工作了。在日常的工作当中他们并没有认真深入地进行具体领导，只是把推广先进经验当成装饰门面的东西，只有在技术表演会上才能看到他们推广先进经验的成绩。
