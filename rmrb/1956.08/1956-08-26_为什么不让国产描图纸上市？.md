    Why isn't domestically produced tracing paper being put on the market?
    The tracing paper that the Paper Industry Administration Bureau assigned to the Jiaxing Minfeng Paper Mill for trial production this year has been successfully trial-produced and has been in mass production since June.

    Since then, many units have written to the Minfeng Paper Mill requesting a supply of tracing paper. Some units, such as the Beijing Black Metallurgy Design Institute, have even sent people directly to the Minfeng Paper Mill to negotiate orders.

    In mid-July, the Minfeng Paper Mill completed all the tracing paper order tasks of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cultural Goods Company. However, after the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station paid the full amount in late July, it has been letting the newly produced tracing paper "sleep" in the warehouse of the Minfeng Paper Mill, and it has been slow to ship it to supply the market. Dozens of units, such as the Changchun Electric Power Bureau and the State-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, have written to the Minfeng Paper Mill saying, "We have searched all over the city and have not seen any domestically produced tracing paper." Many units directly requested the Minfeng Paper Mill to supply the goods; the Xinjiang Water Conservancy Bureau even asked the Minfeng Paper Mill to "air freight some."

    Why doesn't the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cultural Goods Company allow domestically produced tracing paper to be put on the market? Why doesn't it quickly meet the design needs of many enterprises?

### 为什么不让国产描图纸上市？

    为什么不让国产描图纸上市？
    今年造纸工业管理局交给嘉兴民丰造纸厂试制的描图纸，已经试制成功，并且在六月份开始大量生产。
    从这时起，不少单位写信给民丰纸厂要求供应描图纸，有的单位，像北京的黑色冶金设计院，甚至直接派人来民丰纸厂接洽订货。
    七月中旬，民丰纸厂全部完成了中国文化用品公司上海采购供应站的描图纸订货任务。可是，上海采购供应站在七月下旬把货款付清以后，就一直让新制出的描图纸在民丰纸厂的仓库里“睡觉”，迟迟不见启运供应市场。长春电业局、国营经纬纺织机械厂等几十个单位给民丰纸厂来信曾说：“跑遍全市，也没有见到国产描图纸”。许多单位，直接要求民丰纸厂供货；新疆水利局甚至向民丰纸厂提出“空运一些”的要求。
    中国文化用品公司上海采购供应站为什么不让国产描图纸上市呢？为什么不迅速满足很多企业设计上的需要呢？
