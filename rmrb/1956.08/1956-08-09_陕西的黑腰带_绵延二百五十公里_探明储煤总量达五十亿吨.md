Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 8th: The Weihe Coalfield in Shaanxi Province contains approximately 5 billion tons of coal reserves. This is one of the largest coalfields discovered in China to date. This area, known as "Shaanxi's Black Belt," stretches 250 kilometers along the north bank of the Weihe River on the Loess Plateau, from Hancheng in the east to Chunhua in the west, with an average width of about five kilometers. The coal seams are continuous, resembling a "sea of coal." Its geological structure is simple, the coal seams are stable and easy to mine. The three mineable coal seams can be used for power and civilian use, and some can also be used for coking.

    The Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, in formulating the long-term plan for the coal industry in Shaanxi Province, divided this belt-shaped coalfield into many exploration areas. Among them, the Tongchuan Mining Area has submitted detailed survey data for eleven well fields as of July this year, with a total reserve of more than 400 million tons. By the end of this year, the detailed survey reserves that can be submitted in this mining area are close to 1 billion tons, which can basically meet the needs of building coal mines in the Shaanxi area during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Currently, two general survey teams are conducting general survey work around Baishui and Chunhua counties on this "Shaanxi's Black Belt." Two exploration teams are drilling for data in the Tongchuan Mining Area for the design and construction of mine shafts, and an electrical measurement team is calibrating the thickness of the coal seams that have already been drilled. In Yaoxian, 20 kilometers away from Tongchuan, a large reservoir is being explored for water sources, which will be needed to supply water to the Tongchuan Mining Area in the future.

    The geological reconnaissance work of the Weihe Coalfield began as early as 1951. In 1953, drilling work was only carried out in the two regions of Pucheng and Tongchuan. At that time, people's concept of the Weihe Coalfield was only these two scattered areas. After studying the geological data obtained in the past few years, it was confirmed that the coalfield was originally a large continuous area underground, and the known coalfield area is now more than four times larger than before.

### “陕西的黑腰带”绵延二百五十公里  探明储煤总量达五十亿吨

    “陕西的黑腰带”绵延二百五十公里
    探明储煤总量达五十亿吨
    新华社西安8日电　陕西渭北煤田储藏的煤约五十亿吨。这是我国目前发现的最大煤田之一。这条被人们称为“陕西的黑腰带”，绵延在渭河北岸黄土高原的地下，东起韩城，西到淳化共长二百五十公里，平均宽约五公里，煤层连成一片宛如一个“煤海”。它的地质构造简单，煤层稳定，便于开采，可采的三层煤能供动力和民用，部分还可以炼焦。
    西北煤田地质勘探局在制定陕西省煤炭工业远景计划时，把这个带状的煤田划分成很多勘探区。其中铜川矿区截止今年七月份，已经交出十一个井田的精查资料，总储量有四亿多吨。到今年年底为止，在这个矿区可以交出精查储量近十亿吨，基本上能满足第二个五年计划在陕西地区建煤井的需要。
    现在，两个普查队正在这个“陕西的黑腰带”上的白水、淳化两县周围分别做普查工作。两个勘探队正在铜川矿区钻探可供设计建设矿井的资料，一个电测队正在校测已经钻探过的煤层厚度。在离铜川二十公里的耀县，正在为建设一个大水库勘探水源，这是日后供应铜川矿区用水需要的。
    渭北煤田的地质踏勘工作远在1951年就开始了。1953年仅在蒲城和铜川两个地区做钻探工作，那时人们对渭北煤田的概念只是这两片分散的地带，根据几年来得到的地质资料研究以后，才确认煤田在地下原是连成一大片地区，现在已知的煤田面积比从前大了四倍多。（附图片）
