Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) requests its members to further strengthen their work in connecting with the masses in order to mobilize all forces to strive for the cause of socialist construction. This was mentioned by Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the CAPD, in his report at the Second National Congress of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.

In his work report, Zhou Jianren said that CAPD organizations at all levels have done a lot of work in the past few years. Under the education and assistance of the organization, the vast majority of members have actively responded to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, using practical actions to drive the masses they are connected with, and continuously expanding the influence of the association. Many members have played an active role in various movements and central tasks of various units, becoming capable assistants to the Party and administration. Many experienced middle-aged and elderly teacher members have taken the lead in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, devoted themselves to teaching reform, and cultivated new forces, achieving great success. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, more than 400 members have been elected as outstanding teachers, advanced production workers, or have received various awards. Through study and participation in practical struggles and practical work, members and the masses they are connected with have generally received education, and their ideological understanding and political awareness have generally been significantly improved.

Zhou Jianren said that in order to implement the policy of mobilizing all forces to serve socialism, various regions have strengthened the work of connecting with the masses. With the continuous development of the association's work, the organization of the association has also been continuously developed and consolidated. The number of members is now more than eighteen times the number of members at the time of the last conference. The organization of the association has reached a national scale, including six branches in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Shenyang, and six preparatory committees for branches in Guangxi, Shaanxi, Wuhan, Nanjing, Lushun-Dalian, and Fushun, with a total of twelve local organizations and more than 300 branches, grassroots branches, and directly affiliated groups.

The work report then pointed out some shortcomings in past work. Zhou Jianren said that the main shortcomings in the association's work are that the leadership lags behind the masses, and the work lags behind reality. There is insufficient concern for members and the masses they are connected with, and little assistance is provided. Due to the existence of right-leaning conservative thinking, unnecessary "caution" and hesitation are manifested in leadership style. There is also a lack of supervision and inspection of the work of local organizations, and a lack of close contact and consultation. These shortcomings have reduced the influence and role that the association's organization can play. The report demanded that these shortcomings must be vigorously overcome in future work.

In the report, Zhou Jianren talked about the recent proposal by the CPC Central Committee of the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, first and foremost the supervisory role over the Communist Party. He emphasized that this made the China Association for Promoting Democracy, as one of the democratic parties, feel extremely excited and honored, and at the same time feel that its future responsibilities are particularly arduous. The implementation of this policy will play a major role in further promoting people's democracy, enhancing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, especially intellectuals, strengthening the unity of people from all walks of life, consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and accelerating the socialist construction and transformation. Zhou Jianren said that our political line is consistent with the Communist Party: everything for socialism. He also said that the Communist Party is the core of leadership, and the democratic parties, as part of the people's democratic united front, participate in the government and must also bear political responsibility. He said that supervision includes consultation, inspection, criticism, and reporting. As far as democratic parties are concerned, only by earnestly playing a supervisory role can they be considered to have fulfilled their responsibilities for all the work of the country.

The work report then, based on the current development of the situation and the direction pointed out by the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, put forward the future work tasks of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. The tasks require first and foremost to closely connect with the masses, focusing on working with those who are progressive but politically slower to develop. Secondly, it is necessary to assist the Communist Party and the People's Government in coordinating relations in all aspects, the most important of which is the relationship between the Party and non-Party members. It is necessary to actively represent the reasonable demands and legitimate interests of members and the masses they are connected with, and promptly report them to relevant parties so that the government can always hear the opinions and demands of the people and improve its work in a timely manner. The future work tasks also require members to raise their awareness, contribute their strength, and serve socialist construction. And actively develop the organization and do a good job in grassroots organizational work.

    周建人在民主促进会代表会上作报告
    密切联系群众为社会主义建设服务
    新华社19日讯　中国民主促进会要求所属成员进一步加强联系群众的工作，以便调动一切力量为社会主义建设事业而奋斗。这是中国民主促进会副主席周建人在中国民主促进会第二次全国代表大会的报告中所谈到的。
    周建人在工作报告中说，中国民主促进会各级组织几年来做了许多工作，绝大多数会员在组织的教育和帮助下都积极响应共产党和人民政府的号召，用实际行动带动所联系的群众，不断扩大了会的影响。许多会员在各种运动和各单位的中心工作中，都发挥了积极的作用，成为党和行政的得力助手。有许多富有经验的中老年教师会员，带头学习苏联先进经验，致力教学改革，培养新生力量，获得了很大的成就。根据各地不完全的统计，有四百多个会员当选为优秀教师、先进生产工作者或受到各种不同的奖励。通过学习和参加实际斗争及业务工作的实践，会员和所联系的群众普遍受到了教育，思想认识和政治觉悟一般都有显著的提高。
    周建人说，为了贯彻调动一切力量为社会主义服务的方针，各地都加强了联系群众的工作。在会的工作不断开展中，会的组织也不断得到了发展和巩固。现在会员人数比上次大会时的会员人数增加了十八倍多，会的组织已具有全国的规模。包括上海、北京、广州、杭州、天津、沈阳等六个分会和广西、陕西、武汉、南京、旅大、抚顺等六个分会筹备委员会，共有十二个地方组织，三百多个支会、基层支会和直属小组。
    工作报告接着指出了过去工作中的一些缺点。周建人说，会的工作中的主要缺点是领导落后于群众，工作落后于实际。对会员和所联系的群众关心不够，帮助很少。由于右倾保守思想的存在，在领导作风上表现出不必要的“谨小慎微”和缩手缩脚。对各地方组织的工作也缺乏督促检查，缺乏密切联系和商量。这些缺点减低了会的组织所能发挥的影响和作用。报告中要求今后必须在工作中大力加以克服。
    周建人在报告中谈到最近中共中央提出共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针时，强调指出，这对作为民主党派之一的中国民主促进会来说，感到无比的兴奋和光荣，同时也觉得今后责任的格外艰巨。贯彻这个方针，对于进一步发扬人民民主，提高广大人民特别是知识分子的积极性，加强各阶层人民的团结，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，巩固人民民主专政，加速社会主义的建设和改造事业，将起重大的推动作用。周建人说，我们的政治路线同共产党是一致的：一切为了社会主义。他又说，共产党是领导的核心，作为人民民主统一战线组成部分的民主党派参加了政权，也必须负政治上的责任。他说，监督包含着协商、检查、批评和检举等，就民主党派来说，只有认真发挥监督作用，才算是对国家一切工作尽了责任。
    工作报告接着根据当前形势发展和共产党与民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针所指出的方向，提出了中国民主促进会今后的工作任务。任务要求首先要密切联系群众，着重向要求进步而政治上开展较慢的人进行工作。其次，要协助共产党和人民政府协调各方面的关系，其中最主要的是党与非党之间的关系。要积极代表会员和所联系群众的合理要求和正当利益，向有关方面及时反映，以使政府能够经常听到人民群众各方面的意见和要求，及时改进工作。在今后工作任务中还要求会员提高觉悟，贡献力量，为社会主义建设服务。并积极发展组织，做好基层组织工作。
