Talks on Mexican Painting and Printmaking

Margo Ardor Montello, Head of the Mexican National Fine Arts Front Delegation

Mexico is a mixed-race country both materially and culturally. Its culture is a mixture of the ancestral culture of the Indians and the European culture brought to Mexico by the Spanish invaders. This is reflected in all aspects of its social life.

Before Mexico was occupied, its inherent culture had already developed here, and it was as important as the cultures of ancient Egypt and China. This culture was not completely eliminated later. In modern times, people still recognize the importance of the art created by those nations at that time. The Olmecs produced many amazing stone carvers who carved huge head statues as high as two and a half meters and weighing five tons. These statues dedicated to totem worship—gods, or owls, or human skulls—have realistic characteristics; at that time, there were also the greatest pottery makers of ancient times. The art of the Teotihuacáns is equally admirable. They built an important religious city named after themselves, and in this city, a simple and unadorned realistic sculpture and record murals appeared. The emergence of record murals shows that painting has developed and has become a mass art. In the legendary city of Tula, the Nahua people (the Nahua people, and the Aztec, Zapotec, and Maya people mentioned below, are all branches of the Mexican Indians) contributed an important heritage. The Aztecs once reached a high cultural level. In the capital of the empire, Tenochtitlan (later madly destroyed by the Spanish invaders), there is a memorial building with appropriate sculptural proportions and a wonderful ideal harmony. The magnificent Eagle Knight head statue praised by the world is sufficient to prove this, and there is no need to give other examples. At the same time, in another part of Mexico, extending all the way to the inland of Central America, the Maya culture was developing. Their beautiful architecture, exquisite steles and capitals, and perfect urban planning are still admired by the world. As long as you understand the outline of these past developments and carefully observe the natural scenery and understand the social atmosphere, the logic on which our modern art movement is based will be completely clear.

The occupation of Mexico interrupted the development of this civilization. The people were reduced to slaves, and another way of life was imposed on us, but all this could not eliminate this civilization. The new cities designed by the Spanish were built by the Mexican people. In this specific work, another art mixed with the European spirit was unconsciously produced. Mexican plastic arts then had its special form, which was different from the past. Similarly, the tendency of excessive decoration in architecture, painting, sculpture and other arts that arose in Europe during the Renaissance was transmitted to Mexico by the colonists and promoted, especially in churches and monasteries. Due to its acceptance of domestic influences, a mixed form was produced. This phenomenon also occurred in all aspects of life. While architectural art was developing, other upper-level cultures were also looking for forms of expression that conformed to the realistic atmosphere and aesthetics that could represent the people who demanded to get rid of the oppressors. It is true that the culture of the past Indians had been buried for a long time, but its traditions were revealed in all aspects. All artworks made with the participation of Indians or mixed-race people had the infiltration of old traditional art. At that time, painting became a valuable auxiliary tool for missionaries. They decorated churches with murals and made many icons and religious paintings. Later, the Spanish and their descendants in the Americas established the Academy of San Carlos. This academy of fine arts had strict regulations and the purpose of introducing itself to the European market, and later fell into a cold, strict, and disciplined neoclassicism, which was in line with the decadent tendency of society under the governor's rule.

As the art of the Mexican people, printmaking has better conditions because it can be used as illustrations for popular books and newspapers, and it can also be used as propaganda published to promote religion among the vast illiterate masses. Between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, printmaking completed a mass mission and left a valuable legacy.

The 19th century began with the War of Independence led by the nobleman Miguel Hidalgo. He was the priest of the city of Dolores, a passionate, knowledgeable, and revolutionary thinker. He was followed by Morelos, who became the founder of the political and social foundations of this new country. After a long and brutal struggle, Mexico gained its independence in 1821. However, the old feudal forces refused to hand over their power, attempted to seize the fruits of victory, and destroy the revolution. During this period, the advanced liberal forces gradually matured, and Mexico's best sons joined this team, including past insurgents and the most outstanding intellectuals, who were united around Benito Juárez. Juárez was a Zapotec with a strong character. He represented the people's wishes and created our country today. In the bloody struggle for reform, the liberal party won victory, defeating the imperialist attempts—the French invasion and the conspiracy to establish the Habsburg prince as the King of Mexico, thereby consolidating the bourgeois democratic republic. In this long period of struggle, printmaking finally completed a very important and progressive mission, represented by artists who were outstanding in their ability to truly understand the current historical stage.

Later, in the last third of the 19th century, the reactionary forces of the landlords betrayed the ideals of reform and formed a rule that oppressed the people, facilitating the invasion of foreign cultures. Political printmaking then continued this struggle. This printmaking appeared in opposition newspapers, pamphlets in octavo, and on the walls of houses; it was also used in other methods of mass propaganda, serving the cause of the oppressed. At this time, an extremely outstanding artist emerged. He was a loyal son of the Mexican people and a tireless artist. In his long creative life, he produced 15,000 prints. These prints grasped the pulse of the people's lives through depictions of customs, myths, current events, history, and political movements. This artist is José Guadalupe Posada. His works have penetrated into all strata because of their realism and simplicity, sincerity, and novel style. After his death in 1913, his works have continued to shine on our rich, highly artistic, and continuously developing printmaking creation path until now.

The revolution of 1910 was a new episode, which was quickly linked to our struggle for true independence and democracy. This revolution was an anti-imperialist land revolution that finally unearthed the true value of Mexico. Many painters participated in the revolutionary ranks, some as soldiers and some as propagandists, and they made great contributions to the victory of the revolution.

During this great period, Diego Rivera and Siqueiros returned to Mexico. They had rich knowledge and practical life experience of the painful unrest in Europe after World War I, which made them rise up against the declining art. What they admired was something that conformed to the needs of the country, so they unearthed the traditions of the Indians. Due to the profound technical knowledge they gained during their long residence in Europe, they laid a solid foundation for Mexico's new aesthetic theory.

This theory is logical and valuable. They said that small oil paintings are not suitable for expressing the new things generated in the revolution that are transforming the social structure of Mexico. They are determined to move in the direction of popular art. They use the walls of buildings to publicize the program of struggle, to convey news of victory, announcements, and the pure conscience of a nation to all the people. These painters are also often the founders of rural schools, which play a guiding role in Mexican society: first in the struggle to win land, and second, to take the lead in all social activities to improve people's lives. They abandoned all the "serious" academy rules and drew inspiration from the source of people's lives. Their realism was not undermined by formalism. They have taken a big step forward from the valuable contribution made by the first Mexican painter, José María Velasco.

This fact has profound significance. The founding masters launched an extraordinary art movement, which has continued uninterrupted ever since, until now. According to this path opened in 1922, their works are consistent in concept, but each has a unique personal contribution. The exhibition we are holding in Beijing intends to introduce the works of our predecessors and contemporaries. In these works, you can see the same emotions. They all sincerely describe natural scenery and social conditions, expressing a strong combativeness, an undisguised thought, and an open intention to demand universal unity.

People often ask us, on the one hand, our murals are so strong, accusatory, and enthusiastic in fighting, and on the other hand, the regime has such a special nature. How should this contradiction be understood? This question is very reasonable. But it should be known that we have a great art movement that includes most of our painters (including the most prestigious figures), and it is not easy for anyone to prevent the free and combative expression of our art. Moreover, this art grew out of the revolution. Although the revolution has its ups and downs, no one in Mexico dares to eliminate the revolutionary program. These murals depict the most personal problems of our nation, the history of our heroes, and even the specific problems of rural society. They depict the portraits of ordinary Mexican men and women. It is these ordinary men and women who have defended Mexico and prevented it from being destroyed. This art has become a part of our people's wealth.

As for the murals and other works of Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and Siqueiros, we can especially see the greatness of their themes and their excellent expressiveness, while meeting the requirements of mass art. It should be noted that artists are tirelessly looking for new methods and suitable techniques to meet this need. In this regard, it is not just Siqueiros alone who does this tenaciously and enthusiastically. Almost all Mexican artists boldly use new working methods.

Some characteristics of Mexican painting may make the audience feel confused due to the lack of opportunities to introduce them, such as: the frequent use of death as a theme. On the surface, it seems that the purpose is to use ugly things as the theme, but this is not the case. A long time ago, the Indian tradition had this attitude of despising death, without any fatalistic meaning. People often treat death with irony and jokes to express their inner protests, condemn political enemies, ridicule oppressors, and boldly attack authorities. This is not only the case in painting, but also in the use of toys, candies, and folk art to express death. In addition, some people may think that themes such as "Judas" and "Alms" are abstract and obscure. This is not the case. They are all completely true things in our folk customs. "Judas" is a kind of folk sculpture art, made of cardboard and paper, used to satirize dictators, political opportunists, and exploiters. The custom is that at ten o'clock on Holy Saturday (the eve of Easter), it will be hung in the center of the street, and then broken into pieces with some large firecrackers. At this time, many people who feel relieved of their anger will surround and watch. "Alms" is a common religious ceremony among the lower classes, giving symbolic rewards to the gods they love.

Now let's talk about the Mexican art movement. As mentioned above, this movement began in 1922 and was founded by Diego Rivera, Orozco, Xavier, Guerrero and other revolutionary artists. They founded the "Machete", as the organ of the painters' union, to promote the new art and struggle theory, and to strive for the victory of the revolution on land and general social issues. Later, the Communist Party was born. Then many fighting newspapers appeared, such as "30-30", "Face to Face", "Sombrero", and "Liberator". During the period of regeneration of progressive forces under General Lázaro Cárdenas, the "League of Writers and Revolutionary Artists" was established, followed by the world-renowned "People's Print Workshop". From these two organizations, many other organizations have developed, such as the "Association of Graphic Artists", the "Uruapan City Print Workshop", and the "National Plastic Arts Front".

The new generation of painters and sculptors also organized the National Academy of Fine Arts (formerly the San Carlos Academy) and the Painting and Sculpture School affiliated to the National Academy of Fine Arts. In the city of Morelia, there is the Mass School of Plastic Arts led by the painter Alfredo Salce. In Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the capital of the state of Chiapas, there is a School of Painting and Sculpture. There are also many painting clubs led by famous painters such as Erasto Cortés, Gabriel Fernández Ledesma, Carlos Alvarado Lang, Manuel Coronado and others. In all these organizations there is a common driving force: to continue and consolidate the art movement that began in 1922. This also illustrates the strength and success of this movement.

I believe that this exhibition in China will fulfill a patriotic, humanitarian, and progressive mission, because it can make people understand our true art. There is no doubt that it will greatly contribute to strengthening cultural relations between the people of China and Mexico.

    谈谈墨西哥绘画和版画墨
    西哥全国造型艺术阵线代表团团长　马尔戈·阿尔多罗·蒙太洛
    墨西哥在物质上和文化上都是一个混血种的国家。它的文化，是印第安人祖传的文化和由西班牙侵略者带到墨西哥来的欧洲文化相混合起来的。这一点表现于它的社会生活各方面。
    在墨西哥被侵占以前，它的固有文化已经在这里发展起来，它同古代埃及和中国的文化具有同等的重要性。这种文化后来并没有完全消灭，到了现代，人们还认识到当时那些民族所创造的艺术具有何等重要的意义。奥尔麦加族曾产生许多惊人的石刻家，他们雕凿高达二公尺半、重达五吨的巨大头部像，这种献予图腾崇拜者的雕像——神像、或是个猫头鹰、或是个人头骨，都具有写实的特色；那时也有古代最伟大的陶器制作家。德奥蒂乌阿刚人的艺术也同样令人钦佩，它曾建造了一座以它自己的名字命名的重要的宗教城市，并在这个城市里出现了一种简单朴质的现实主义的雕塑和记事壁画。记事壁画的出现表明绘画向前发展了，它已经成为一种群众的艺术。在相传的都拉城中，纳瓦族（纳瓦族和下面将要说到的阿兹台克族、萨博德加族、麦耶族，都是墨西哥印第安人的分支）贡献了重要遗产，阿兹台克族曾达到高度的文化水准。在帝国的首都德诺去蒂脱朗（后被西班牙侵略者所疯狂毁坏），有一个纪念建筑，它的雕刻比例适当，有一种美妙的理想的和谐，关于这一点有举世称赞的壮丽的阿吉拉骑士头像足资证明，其他例子不消多举。与此同时，在墨西哥的另一部分，一直延向中美的内地，麦耶族的文化在发展着，他们优美的建筑，精致的石碑和柱头，以及完善的城市规划，现在还受到全世界的赞赏。只要了解了过去这些发展的梗概，如果再能仔细地观察自然景物，理解到社会气氛，那么，我们现代的美术运动所依据的逻辑就完全了然了。
    墨西哥的被侵占，中断了这种文明的发展过程，人民沦为奴隶，另一种生活方式强加给我们，可是这一切并不能消灭这种文明。西班牙人设计的新的城市，是由墨西哥人民动手建筑的，这样，在具体工作中，不知不觉地产生了同欧洲精神相混合的另一种艺术。墨西哥的造型艺术遂有了它的特殊形式，而同过去的有所差别。同样，在文艺复兴时期在欧洲产生的在建筑、绘画、雕刻等艺术中过分装饰的倾向，由殖民者传达到墨西哥，特别在教堂和修道院中发扬起来，由于它接受了本国的影响，而产生了一种混合的形式。在生活各方面，也都产生了这个现象。与建筑艺术发展的同时，其他上层文化也在那里寻找符合于现实气氛的表现形式和能够代表要求摆脱压迫者的人民的美学。诚然，过去的印第安人的文化曾被长期掩埋，可是它的传统却在各方面现露出来，在一切有印第安人或混血的人参加下制作出来的艺术品，都有旧的传统艺术的渗入。那时，绘画成为传教士的一种宝贵的辅助工具，他们用壁画把教堂装饰起来，制作了很多圣像和宗教画。其后，西班牙人和他们在美洲的子孙建立起圣卡尔洛斯学院来。这个美术学院有一个严格的规范和一个要把自己介绍到欧洲市场上去的目的，后来更陷于冷酷的严守清规戒律的新古典主义之中，这是符合于总督统治下的社会的堕落倾向的。
    作为墨西哥人民的艺术，版画具有较好的条件，因为它可作通俗书籍和报刊的插图，也可用作在广大文盲群众中宣传宗教而出版的宣传品。在十六世纪和十七世纪之间，版画完成了一个群众的使命，并留下了宝贵的业绩。
    十九世纪一开始就爆发了由贵族米盖尔·伊达尔谷领导的独立战争。他是陶洛莱斯城的神甫，一个热情的、博学的、革命的思想家。继之而起的是莫莱洛斯，他成为这个新国家的政治与社会的奠基人。经过长期的惨酷斗争，到1821年墨西哥才获得独立。但是，旧的封建势力不肯交出他们的政权，企图霸占胜利果实，破坏革命。在这时期中，先进的自由主义势力逐渐成熟，墨西哥最优秀的儿子都参加了这支队伍，包括过去的起义者和最杰出的知识分子，他们都团结在培尼笃、华莱斯的周围。华莱斯是一个具有坚强性格的萨博德加族人，他代表了人民的愿望，缔造了我们今天的国家。在流血的改革斗争中，自由主义政党取得了胜利，击败了帝国主义的企图——法国的侵略和企图立哈普斯堡王子为墨西哥国王的阴谋，从而巩固了资产阶级民主共和国。在这个长时期的斗争中，版画终于完成了一个极重要的具有进步性的使命，这是以对当前历史阶段具有真知灼见的才能卓越的艺术家为代表的。
    再后，在十九世纪最后三分之一的年代里，大地主反动势力背叛了改革的理想，而形成一个压迫人民的统治，给外国文化的侵入以便利。政治性版画于是把这一斗争继续了下去，在反对派的报纸上，和八开报纸的传单上、房子的墙壁上，都出现了这种版画；它也被利用于其他对群众宣传的方法中，它服务于被压迫者的事业。这时，有一个极为出众的艺术家产生了，他是墨西哥人民忠实的儿子，一个不知疲倦的艺术家，在长期的创作生活中，他制作了一万五千幅版画，这些版画，通过对风俗、神话、时事、历史以及政治运动的描写，掌握了人民生活的脉搏。这位艺术家就是何塞·瓜达路佩·卜萨达。他的作品，由于它的现实性和质朴、诚挚、新颖的风格而深入到各个阶层中去。在1913年他死去以后，他的作品，一直到现在，在我们丰富的、具有高度艺术水平的和继续向前发展的版画创作道路上放出光彩。
    1910年的革命，是一个新的插曲，它很快地同我们争取真正的独立与民主的斗争联结起来。这次革命是一个反帝的土地革命，它最后把墨西哥的真正价值发掘出来。有许多画家参加了革命队伍，有的充当士兵，有的作宣传员，他们对革命的获得胜利有很大贡献。
    在这伟大的时期，狄爱谷·里威拉和西盖洛斯回到了墨西哥。他们有丰富的知识和第一次世界大战后欧洲的痛苦不安的实际生活经验，这使他们起而反对正在没落中的艺术。他们所推崇的是一种符合于国家需要的东西，因之，他们把印第安人的传统发掘出来。由于他们在欧洲长期居住时所获得的渊博的技术知识，给墨西哥新的美学理论打下了巩固的基础。
    这个理论是合乎逻辑的，也是有价值的。他们说小型油画是不适于表现在革命中产生的、正在改造着墨西哥社会结构的新事物的，他们决心要朝着大众化艺术的方向走，他们利用建筑物的墙壁，来宣传斗争的纲领，把胜利消息和公告以及一个民族纯洁的良心传达给所有的人民。这些画家也常常是农村学校的创办人，农村学校在墨西哥社会中起着向导作用：首先在争取土地的斗争中起作用，其次是带头参加一切为了改善人民生活的社会活动。他们把一切“严肃”的学院的规律抛弃掉，而从人民生活的源泉中吸取灵感。他们的这种现实主义精神没有被形式主义所破坏。他们已经从第一位墨西哥画家何塞·玛利亚·威拉斯克曾作出的宝贵贡献向前迈进了一大步。
    这个事实具有极深刻的意义。创始的大师们展开了一个非凡的美术运动，并在以后从未间断地继续下来，直到现在。按照这个从1922年开辟的道路，他们的作品在观念上是一致的，但是各有独特的个人贡献。我们正在北京举行的展览会，打算介绍一下我们前人的和当代的作品，在这些作品中，可以看到同样的感情，它们都真诚地描写了自然景物和社会情况，表现着一种坚强的战斗性，一种毫无掩饰的思想和一种公开要求普遍团结起来的意向。
    常常有人问我们，一方面我们的壁画是这么强烈、有控诉性和热情于战斗，另一方面，政权却是那么一个特别的性质，这种矛盾应如何理解呢？这个问题问得很有道理。可是应该知道，我们有一个包括我们大多数的画家（其中包括最负盛名的人物）在内的伟大的美术运动，谁要阻止我们艺术的自由与斗争性的表现是不容易的。况且，这个艺术是从革命中生长出来的，尽管革命有高潮和低潮，在墨西哥没有人敢消灭革命纲领，而这些壁画所描写的是我们民族最切身的问题，我们英雄的历史甚至农村社会的具体问题。它们描绘了墨西哥普通男女的肖像。正是这些普通男女保卫了墨西哥，使它不致遭到破坏，这种艺术已成为我们人民的一部分财富。
    至于里威拉、何塞·克莱门德·奥拉斯克和西盖洛斯等人的壁画和其他作品，我们特别可以看到它们主题思想的伟大性及其出色的表现力，而又适应大众艺术的要求，应该注意的是，艺术家们不倦地寻找新的方法和适宜的技术来满足这种需要，在这方面不仅仅是西盖洛斯一人顽强而热忱地这样做，几乎所有墨西哥的艺术家都大胆地使用着新的工作方法。
    墨西哥绘画的某些特点，可能会由于缺乏介绍的机会而使观众感到一定的迷惑，例如：常常用死亡作主题。从表面上看，好像是故意要用难看的东西作主题，实际上并不是这样。很久以前，印第安人的传统就有这种轻视死亡的态度，并没有任何宿命论的含意。人们常怀着嘲讽和玩笑的心情对待死亡，以发抒自己内心的抗议，斥责政治敌人，嘲笑压迫者，大胆地向权威者攻击。不仅绘画如此，其他还有利用玩具、糖果和民间艺术等来表现死亡的。另外，有人也许认为“犹大”和“布施”等主题是抽象而晦涩的。其实不然，它们都是我国民间习俗中完全真实的事情。“犹大”是一种民间雕刻艺术，用硬纸板和纸做成，用来讽刺独裁者、政治上的机会主义者和剥削者。这种风俗是，在圣礼拜六（复活节的前夕）上午十点，将它悬挂在大街的中心，然后用一些大的鞭炮把它崩碎，这时会有许多感到舒泄了自己心中愤懑不平的群众包围着观看。“布施”是下层阶级的一种普通的宗教仪式，给他们所喜爱的神以象征性的报答。
    现在我们来谈一谈墨西哥美术运动。上面已经提到，这个运动开始于1922年，是由狄里威拉、奥拉斯克、艾克萨威尔、盖莱洛等人和革命艺术家团体创始的。他们创办了“弯刀报”，作为画家工会的机关刊物，宣传新的艺术和斗争理论，争取革命在土地和一般社会问题上取得胜利。其后，诞生了共产党。接着又出现了许多战斗的报纸，如“30—30”、“面对面”、“斗方帽”、“解放者”等。在拉萨洛·卡尔德纳斯将军执政时，进步力量的再生时期，成立了“作家与革命艺术家联盟”，随后又成立了全世界闻名的“通俗图画社”。由这两个组织又发展出许多其他组织，如“图画艺术家协会”、“乌鲁阿邦城图画社”和“全国造型艺术阵线”等。
    新生一代的画家和雕刻家们同样也组织了全国美术学院（即前圣卡尔洛斯学院）和全国美术学院所属绘画与塑像学校，在莫莱利亚城有画家阿尔弗莱多·萨尔塞领导的造型艺术大众学校，在南溪阿柏斯州的杜克斯特拉·古蒂耶莱兹城有绘画与雕塑学校，其他还有许多由著名的画家如艾拉斯托·高尔台斯、卡伯里爱尔·费尔南德斯·赖德斯马、卡尔洛斯·阿尔瓦拉多·兰、马努艾尔·高洛纳多等人领导的画社。在这一切组织中有一个共同的动力，就是继续并巩固创始于1922年的美术运动。这也说明了这个运动的力量和成功。
    我认为这次在中国举行展览会，将完成一个爱国的人道的和进步的使命，因为它能使人了解到我们的真正的艺术。毫无疑问，它对加强中墨两国人民间文化关系将有极大的贡献。
