    Open Theft
    In the No. 3 Engineering Section of the No. 2 Engineering Company of the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, there is a trend of open stealing.
    This engineering section had a project where they received 540 kilograms of steel plates. After the project was completed, they returned 710 kilograms of steel plates; besides what was used on the project, they returned 170 kilograms more than they originally received. How could this engineering section do so much work without using materials? It turns out they had a "trick," which was "Wednesday Activity Day." Every Wednesday was the rest day for Party A's (construction unit) capital construction materials department. On this day, the engineering section took the opportunity to carry out activities on a large scale. Not long ago, on a Wednesday, 128 imported aluminum alloy steel plates appeared on the construction site of this engineering section. People knew that this engineering section had not purchased this kind of steel plate! It turned out that this was decided at a scheduling meeting by Xu Jing, the director of the engineering section, and Cao, the captain of the hydropower team, and Cheng Hongzhi, the chairman of the labor union, led dozens of workers to "take" them from Party A's material yard. Because they "completed" the savings targets through this method, they also received certificates of merit.
    When people criticized their theft, they justified themselves, saying that Party A had also stolen their materials. They specifically pointed out that in mid-July, the electrician group of Party A's electrical installation unit "took" 224 jump boards and 232 scaffold poles from them.
    Of course, it is wrong for some units of Party A to steal jump boards, scaffold poles, etc., from this engineering section; Party A's poor material management, which allows people to take advantage of it, is also a shortcoming. But can they openly steal other people's materials because of this? Meng Xianquan

    公开的盗窃
    在建筑工程部东北工程管理总局第二工程公司第三工程处里，有一股公开的偷风。
    这个工程处有一项工程，领到钢板五百四十公斤，到工程完工以后，退回的钢板竟有七百一十公斤；除工程上用掉的以外，比原来领的还多退回一百七十公斤。这个工程处为什么能够不用材料就作很多活呢？原来他们有个“窍门”，这就是“星期三活动日”。每逢星期三是甲方（建设单位）基本建设材料部门的休息日，在这一天，这个工程处就趁机大肆活动。不久以前的一个星期三，这个工程处的工地上出现了一百二十八张从国外进口的铝合金钢板。人们知道，这个工程处并没有采购这种钢板呵！原来这是根据工程处主任徐静在调度会议上的决定，由水电队曹队长和工会主席程鸿之带领几十个工人从甲方材料场“拿”来的。因为通过这种办法“完成”了节约指标，他们还得到了奖状呢。
    人们批评他们这种盗窃行为的时候，他们却振振有词，说甲方也偷过他们的材料。他们还具体指出，在七月中旬，甲方电气安装单位的钳工一组就“拿”了他们二百二十四块跳板、二百三十二根脚手杆。
    当然，甲方有的单位偷这个工程处的跳板、脚手杆等，是不对的；甲方材料管理不善，使人有机可乘，也是缺点。但是，难道就可以因此明目张胆地偷人家的材料吗？孟宪全
