Peddlers Deep into the Mountains

(Our dispatch) The Luding County in Sichuan Province is a high mountain area with inconvenient transportation, making it difficult for farmers to buy and sell goods in the past. Currently, supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Luding County have organized a group of small vendors into "peddlers," who travel over mountains to remote areas to carry out agency purchase and sales services. The goods sold by the peddlers include general merchandise, cloth, oil, salt, prepared medicines, etc.; the goods purchased include minor local specialties and waste products. The small vendors adopt the "three agreements" method of pre-arranging time, location, and goods with the farmers, and deliver the goods to their door on time. This method is welcomed by the majority of farmers. Many agricultural cooperative members say: "Delivery to our door allows us not to delay production and we can work more!" The peddlers' business is very good, with each small vendor making dozens to hundreds of yuan a day on average, and the commission earned is enough to maintain their livelihood.

    货郎担深入山区
    本报讯　四川省泸定县是个高山地区，交通不便，过去，农民买卖东西很困难。目前，泸定县各区的供销合作社已把一批小商贩组织成“货郎担”，由他们翻山越岭深入偏僻地区进行代购代销业务。货郎担代销的商品有百货、布匹、油盐、成药等；代购的有小宗土特产品和废品。小商贩们采取同农民预先约定时间、地点、货品的“三约”办法，按时把货送上门去。这种办法受到广大农民的欢迎，许多农业合作社社员说：“送货上门，使我们不误生产，可以多出工了！”货郎担的营业很好，平均每个小商贩每天要做几十元到一百元的生意，所得的手续费足够维持生活。
