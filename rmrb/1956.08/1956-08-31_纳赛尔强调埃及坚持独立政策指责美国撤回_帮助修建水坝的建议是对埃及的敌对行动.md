Xinhua News Agency, August 30th, New York Dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser told a reporter from the "New York Herald Tribune" that Egypt's policy is independent.

The "New York Herald Tribune" published Nasser's conversation with the newspaper's Cairo correspondent, Barrett McGurn, on August 29th. Nasser said, "All policy decisions in Egypt are made here (in Cairo) in this office, not in Moscow and not in Washington."

Nasser said, "I do not want to be a member of the Soviet bloc, nor do I want to be a member of the British Empire."

Nasser stated that the proportion of trade with socialist countries is increasing in Egypt. He pointed out that the responsibility for this development lies with the West, because it froze Egypt's foreign exchange. He believes that his current problem is dealing with the commercial blows inflicted on him by the West.

The American reporter asked him whether the deterioration of relations between Egypt and the West could be stopped and whether this trend could be reversed. Nasser said, "It is possible, but the initiative is not in our hands."

Nasser believes that the West has ignored the hopes of Arab countries since the signing of the Baghdad Pact.

Nasser also said that he was annoyed by the way the United States withdrew its offer to help Egypt build the Aswan Dam. Nasser said that if the reason given was that this aid was not feasible, "then I would say to you, that is your business." But he pointed out that to withdraw the offer on the grounds that the Egyptian government created bad economic conditions, that is a hostile act, and that is another matter.

    纳赛尔强调埃及坚持独立政策指责美国撤回
    帮助修建水坝的建议是对埃及的敌对行动
    新华社30日讯　纽约消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔对“纽约先驱论坛报”记者说，埃及的政策是独立的。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”8月29日刊载了纳赛尔对这家报纸驻开罗记者巴雷特·麦根的谈话。纳赛尔说，“埃及所有的政策决定都是在这里（开罗）在这个办公室中作出的，不是在莫斯科也不是在华盛顿作出的。”
    纳赛尔说：“我不愿意成为苏联集团的一员，也不愿意成为英帝国的一员。”
    纳赛尔说，社会主义阵营国家在埃及贸易中所占比重正在增加。他指出，这种发展的责任在于西方，因为它冻结了埃及的外汇。他认为，他的当前问题是对付西方对他进行的商业打击。
    美国记者问他，埃及和西方关系的恶化能否加以制止，这种趋势能否倒转过来。纳赛尔说：“这是可能的，但是主动权不在我们手中。”
    纳赛尔认为，自从签订巴格达条约以来，西方忽视了阿拉伯国家的希望。
    纳赛尔还说，美国撤回它帮助埃及建立阿斯旺水坝的建议的方式使他很恼怒。纳赛尔说，如果提出的理由是不可能进行这笔援助，“那么我就会对你们说，这是你们的事”。但是他指出，以埃及政府造成不好的经济条件为理由来撤回这个建议，这就是一个敌对行动，是另外一回事情了。
