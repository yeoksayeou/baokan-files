Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 15th: By early August, more than 1,670 agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had established clubs.

When establishing clubs, agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives in various regions adhered to the spirit of diligence and frugality. Many cooperatives utilized old houses, repairing and painting them to serve as clubs. They also unified previously dispersed amateur theatrical troupes to address the need for costumes and musical instruments for newly established amateur troupes.

Since establishing these clubs, the cultural life in agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives has become increasingly active. In the Narengerile Pastoral Cooperative of the Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner in the Pingdi Quan Administrative Region, 95% of the young adults have participated in various club activities. Herdsmen have created more than 20 original songs, dances, and theatrical programs. The cooperative also regularly holds wrestling, archery, and horse racing sports meets.

    内蒙古自治区群众文化生活活跃
    一千多农牧业合作社建立了俱乐部
    新华社呼和浩特15日电　到八月上旬，内蒙古自治区已经有一千六百七十多个农牧业生产合作社建立了俱乐部。
    各地农牧业生产合作社建立俱乐部的时候，都本着勤俭办社的精神，有不少社利用旧房子加以修理粉刷作为俱乐部，并把过去分散的业余剧团统一组织起来，以解决新建业余剧团需用的服装和乐器设备问题。
    这些农牧业生产合作社在建立起俱乐部以后，文化生活日渐活跃起来。平地泉行政区察哈尔右翼后旗那仁格日勒牧业社，现在有95％的青壮年都参加了俱乐部的各项活动，牧民们自己创作的歌舞、戏剧节目就有二十多个，社里还定期举行摔跤、射箭、赛马运动会。
