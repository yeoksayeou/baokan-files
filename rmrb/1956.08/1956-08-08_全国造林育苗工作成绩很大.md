Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The number of forest seedlings cultivated nationwide this year has, to date, exceeded three and a half times that of the same period last year. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, the area of nurseries across the country has reached more than 46,000 hectares. The significant increase in nursery area is mainly due to the extensive seedling cultivation by agricultural cooperatives and forestry cooperatives in various regions. Agricultural cooperatives and forestry cooperatives in various regions have newly established nurseries this year, cultivating a large number of seedlings of pine, fir, elm, willow, Chinese locust, and oak, as well as other seedlings of fruit trees, tung oil trees, tea trees, Chinese tallow trees, walnuts, and Eucommia ulmoides.

In order to ensure the quality of seedling cultivation, state-owned nurseries and nurseries of agricultural cooperatives and forestry cooperatives in various regions have strengthened work such as inter-tillage, weeding, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests this year. Many regions have also carried out topdressing work.

    全国造林育苗工作成绩很大
    新华社6日讯　今年全国所育的林木幼苗，到目前止已经超过去年同期的三倍半。据林业部的不完全统计，全国的苗圃面积已经达到了四万六千多公顷。苗圃面积增加很多，主要是由于各地农业社和林业社育苗的很多。各地的农业社和林业社今年都新辟了苗圃，培育了大量的松、杉、榆树、柳树、洋槐和橡子树等树苗，其他还有果树、油桐、茶树、乌桕、核桃和杜仲等树苗。
    为了保证育苗质量，今年各地的国营苗圃和农业社和林业社的苗圃都加强了中耕、除草和防治病虫害等工作。许多地区还进行了追肥工作。
