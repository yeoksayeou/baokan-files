Heilongjiang Gold Pen Factory Has Improved Its Gold Pens

    (Reported by this newspaper) After participating in the National Fountain Pen Technology Conference, the Heilongjiang Gold Pen Factory in Qiqihar examined the shortcomings of its gold pens, such as rough writing, loose parts and springs, leaking ink from the pen feed, and uneven outer rings. It formulated a plan to catch up with advanced factories by the end of the third quarter.

    Now, the quality of the gold pens produced by this factory has significantly improved. In early July, the assembly workshop designed a new type of pen feed, which greatly increased the ink storage capacity of the gold pen, ensured even ink flow, and avoided problems of ink leakage and no ink flow. Polishing workers in the nib workshop studied advanced experiences and overcame the problem of the nib scratching the paper. The pen barrel workshop promoted advanced operating methods and improved the cutting tool, overcoming the problems of cracking and unevenness in the outer ring of the pen cap.

    To ensure quality, the factory has also strengthened its technical management work, strictly implementing inspection systems at every stage from the raw materials and parts entering the warehouse to the finished products leaving the factory. (Yong Zhi)
