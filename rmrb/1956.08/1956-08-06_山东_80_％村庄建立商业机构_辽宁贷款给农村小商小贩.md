Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: After Shandong Province adjusted its rural commercial network, nearly 80% of the tens of thousands of villages with more than 100 households in the province have established commercial institutions. Some counties have basically achieved a situation where every village has a store. Many small villages with fewer than 50 households and remote mountain villages, which previously had no stores and little trade, have now mostly set up small shops. A small number of villages without small shops are supplied by mobile salespersons or entrusted to local agricultural production cooperatives for consignment sales. The work of adjusting the rural commercial network in the province has now been basically completed.

The adjustment of the commercial network has brought many conveniences to farmers. For example, in Gaotang County, about 90% of farmers can now buy daily necessities without leaving their villages. According to a survey of the Quanlin, Xingcun, and Zhegou districts of Sishui County, the number of people going to markets and fairs and going to the city to buy things has decreased by 53% due to the adjustment of the commercial network. In Teng County in the Yimeng Mountain area, after commercial institutions were established in 95% of the villages, the sales amount in the second quarter increased by 32% compared with the first quarter.

The work of adjusting the commercial network in various places has been welcomed and supported by the majority of farmers. Farmers in Zhongdingshan Village, Sangcun District, Teng County, used to have to travel over mountains and ridges to buy things dozens of miles away. This year, the supply and marketing cooperative set up a store in this village, and the farmers were so happy that they voluntarily organized sixty or seventy people to repair the mountain road to facilitate the transportation of goods. At the same time, they also organized seven pairs of carrying poles to help the salesmen transport goods.

This newspaper reports that by the end of June, 95% of the villages in Teng County, Shandong Province, had commercial institutions.

The county carried out a major adjustment of the rural commercial network in April and May. Many villages without stores now have stores, which is very popular with farmers. In the past, farmers in mountainous areas were busy going to market, which wasted a lot of production time. After the establishment of the rural commercial network, large gatherings of tens of thousands of people in various places have been reduced to five or six thousand people, and gatherings of five or six thousand people have been reduced to two or three thousand people, and the time for disbanding the gatherings has also been brought forward.

While adjusting the commercial network, the Teng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent full-time cadres to go deep into the agricultural production cooperatives to investigate the commodities needed by farmers at various times, and then, according to the quantity of commodities needed by farmers, the repurchase cycle, and transportation conditions, it transferred some commodities in advance as reserves. In this way, the phenomenon of stockpiling on one side and out-of-stock on the other is prevented.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: Many rural small traders and vendors in Liaoning Province who lack funds have recently received loan assistance from the National People's Bank. According to statistics from eighteen counties, including Yixian, Huanren, Suizhong, Xiuyan, Panshan, and Beipiao, as of July 25, 201 self-employed small traders and vendors have received more than 23,400 yuan in national loans, averaging more than 110 yuan per household.

After these vendors received loans, their business situation improved, their enthusiasm for operation greatly increased, and the variety of operations generally increased by more than 30 to more than 70 kinds. Wang Fenglin, a vendor in Tianzhuangtai, Panshan, immediately purchased more than 50 kinds of socks, towels, and miscellaneous small commodities from the wholesale department of the supply and marketing cooperative after receiving the loan.

### 山东80％村庄建立商业机构  辽宁贷款给农村小商小贩

    山东80％村庄建立商业机构
    辽宁贷款给农村小商小贩
    据新华社济南电　山东省调整农村商业网以后，全省几万个百户以上的村庄中，已经有近80％的村庄建立了商业机构，部分县基本上做到了村村有商店。许多不足五十户的小村和偏僻的山庄，过去没有商店，也很少有商贩往来，现在大都设立了小铺；少数没有设立小铺的村庄，由流动代销员串乡供应，或委托当地农业生产合作社代销。全省调整农村商业网的工作目前已基本完成。
    商业网调整以后，给农民带来了很多方便。如高唐县现在有90％左右的农民可以不出村就能买到日用必需品，据泗水县泉林、星村和柘沟等三个区的调查，由于调整商业网，赶集赶会和进城买东西的人比过去减少了53％。沂蒙山区的滕县，在95％的村庄设立了商业机构以后，第二季度的销货金额比第一季度增加了32％。
    各地调整商业网的工作，受到广大农民的欢迎和支持。滕县桑村区中顶山村农民，过去经常翻山越岭到几十里以外去买东西。今年供销合作社在这个村设了商店，农民们高兴得自动组织了六、七十个人修整山路，便利货物运输；同时还组织了七付担子帮助营业员运货。
    本报讯　到六月底，山东滕县已有95％的村庄有了商业机构。
    这个县在四、五月间进行了一次农村商业网大调整，许多没有商店的村庄有了商店，很受农民欢迎。过去山区农民因忙于赶集，耽误很多生产时间。农村商业网建立以后，各地万人的大集就减少至五、六千人，五、六千人的集就减至两、三千人，而且散集的时间也提早了。
    在调整商业网的同时，滕县供销社又派专职干部深入农业生产合作社调查农民各个时期需要的商品，再根据农民需要的商品数量、重买周期以及交通情况，事先调运一些商品，作为储备。这样，就防止了一边积压，一边脱销的现象。
    新华社沈阳4日电　辽宁省许多缺少资金的农村小商小贩，最近都得到了国家人民银行的贷款扶助。据义县、桓仁、绥中、岫岩、盘山、北票等十八个县到七月二十五日的统计，二百零一户自营小商小贩，就得到国家两万三千四百多元的贷款，平均每户得贷款一百一十多元。
    这些商贩得到贷款后，营业情况好转，经营积极性大为提高，经营品种一般增加了三十多种到七十多种。盘山田庄台商贩王凤林，得到贷款后，立即到供销合作社批发部购进袜子、毛巾及零星小百货五十多种。
