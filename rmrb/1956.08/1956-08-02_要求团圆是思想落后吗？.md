    Is Demanding Family Reunion a Sign of Backward Thinking?
    Editor:
    My wife and I have been working in different locations for four years. I have repeatedly requested the leadership to help me solve this problem, but until now, I have not only received no assistance, but have also been met with considerable indifference and reprimands.
    I am a railway worker, and my wife, Zhang Zhongxian, is a female worker at the Tianjin Hongfu Dyeing and Weaving Factory. As early as 1953, when I was working at the Shuijiahu Station of the Bengbu Sub-bureau of the Jinan Railway Administration, I requested the leadership to consider transferring me to work in Tianjin. However, Section Chief Niu of the personnel section criticized me for being "ideologically backward."
    In April of this year, I was transferred to work at the Jinan Business Office, where there is a spinning mill. Comrade Yang of the Statistics Section of the Jinan Railway Administration also has a wife who is a female worker in a yarn factory. Not long ago, he requested the leadership of the Statistics Section to contact the Provincial Department of Industry, and his wife was transferred from Xi'an to work in Jinan. Therefore, on June 8th, I submitted a request to the personnel section of our business office to transfer my wife to Jinan. Unexpectedly, Section Chief Chen of the personnel section said, "This is a private matter, we don't care about it. You can negotiate with the Department of Industry yourself!" When I cited the example of how the Statistics Section helped Comrade Yang solve this problem, Section Chief Chen actually said, "That was a mistake made by the Statistics Section, and we cannot make the same mistake again." I increasingly feel that there is no hope for our couple to reunite, and at the same time, there is a question that I am increasingly unable to answer: If something like this happened to people like Section Chief Niu and Section Chief Chen, I wonder how they would feel?

### 要求团圆是思想落后吗？

    要求团圆是思想落后吗？编辑同志：
    我和我的爱人分在两地工作已经四年了。我曾经不断地请求领导上帮助我解决这个问题，但是，一直到现在，我不但没有得到什么帮助，相反地还受到了不少冷遇和申斥。
    我是个铁路工作人员，爱人张仲贤是天津宏孚染织厂的女工。远在1953年，我在济南铁路管理局蚌埠分局水家湖车站工作时，就曾请求领导上考虑调我到天津去工作，可是人事科的牛干事竟批评我“思想落后”。
    今年四月，我被调到济南营业所工作，这个地方是有纺纱厂的。济南铁路管理局统计处的杨同志的爱人也是纱厂女工，不久以前，他请求统计处的领导上同省工业厅联系后，把他爱人从西安调来济南工作。因此，我在六月八日向我们商务处人事股提出调我爱人来济南的要求，不料想人事股的陈股长说：“这是私人的事，我们不管，你自己向工业厅交涉吧！”当我举例统计处是怎样帮助杨同志解决这个问题时，陈股长竟说“那是统计处犯了错误，我们不能再犯。”我越来越感到我们夫妇团聚无望，同时也有一个问题使我越来越得不到解答：像我这样的事，如果发生在牛干事、陈股长这些人的身上，不知道他们会作何感想？
