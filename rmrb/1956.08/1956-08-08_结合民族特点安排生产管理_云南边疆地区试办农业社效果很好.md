Combining Ethnic Characteristics in Production Management
Trial Implementation of Agricultural Cooperatives in Yunnan Border Areas Shows Good Results

(Our Dispatch) The 1,048 agricultural production cooperatives that were the focus of trial implementation in the border areas of Yunnan Province have gradually improved their management level in production by incorporating ethnic characteristics.

In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region, Gengma Dai and Va Autonomous County, Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County, Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, as well as in areas like Hekou, Shuangjiang, and Ximeng, 1,048 agricultural cooperatives were the focus of trial implementation, including 73 agricultural cooperatives that were being trialed in areas directly developing mutual aid and cooperation movements without going through land reform. These trial agricultural cooperatives have achieved good results in establishing labor organizations and arranging production by paying attention to the characteristics of various ethnic groups. For example, the Dai people have a habit of separating young and old women for work, so the Humen Agricultural Cooperative in Luxi County organized youth groups and elderly women's groups separately when assigning farm work. The Dai also have taboos such as "no transplanting seedlings if born in the year of the Rabbit" and "no building dams if born in the year of the Rat," so the agricultural cooperatives also paid attention to avoiding these days. In addition, agricultural cooperatives took care not to arrange work for members when they were "visiting relatives." As a result, not only was the production plan ensured, but the enthusiasm of the masses for production was also inspired.

In the work of trial implementation of agricultural cooperatives in these areas, attention was also paid to the level of development of the ethnic groups. Many cooperatives started with work evaluation and point recording, and then developed to piece-rate contracting, seasonal contracting, and year-round contracting. In the Dehong Jingpo area, when formulating plans, they adopted an approach from easy to difficult, starting with arranging one day's production, and then further arranging short-term production. At the same time, they also helped the trial agricultural cooperatives train accounting personnel. This has gradually improved the management level of the agricultural cooperatives. Now, most of the 397 agricultural cooperatives in this autonomous prefecture have contracted work by season and solar term.

Due to proper management, agricultural cooperatives have fully demonstrated their superiority in the intense production. The 67 agricultural cooperatives trialed in the Nujiang area completed the planting plan half a month ahead of schedule. The Ximeng Agricultural Cooperative of the Va people has opened up more than three times as much paddy field as last year. After seeing the benefits of agricultural cooperatives with their own eyes, farmers of all ethnic groups have asked to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. The Xiangsuan Cooperative in Zhangfeng Township, Longchuan County, with its superiority shown in spring plowing, has driven farmers of the Va and other ethnic groups to organize 39 mutual aid groups. In Luopu Township, Yuanyang County, 80% of Hani, Nisu and other ethnic farmers have joined mutual aid groups. In the 103 townships in the Honghe Autonomous Region that have completed land reform, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid groups has also reached more than 60%.

### 结合民族特点安排生产管理  云南边疆地区试办农业社效果很好

    结合民族特点安排生产管理
    云南边疆地区试办农业社效果很好
    本报讯　云南省边疆地区重点试办的1，048个农业生产合作社，由于结合了民族特点，在生产中逐步地提高了管理水平。
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族自治区、怒江傈僳族自治区、耿马傣族佧佤族自治县、江城哈尼族彝族自治县、澜沧拉祜族自治区以及河口、双江、西盟等地区，重点试办了1，048个农业社，其中有七十三个农业社是在不经过土地改革直接发展互助合作运动地区试办的。这些试办的农业社在建立劳动组织、安排生产中，注意结合各民族的特点，收到良好的效果。如傣族有青年、老年妇女分开做活的习惯，潞西县户闷农业社在分配农活时，就分别组织了青年组和老年妇女组。傣族还有“属兔不裁秧”、“属鼠不打坝”等忌日，农业社也就注意岔开。此外农业社在社员“串亲戚”时，注意不安排活计。这样做的结果，不但保证了生产计划的进行，而且也启发了群众的生产积极性。
    这些地区在试办农业合作社的工作中，还注意了民族的发展水平。许多社都从评工记分做起，再发展到计件包工、季节包工、常年包工等。德宏景颇族地区在订计划时，采取由易到难的做法，先从安排一天的生产做起，再进一步安排短期的生产。同时，还帮助试办的农业社训练会计人员。这样就使农业社逐步提高了经营管理水平。现在这个自治州的397个农业社绝大部分都已按季节、节令包工了。
    由于管理得当，农业社在紧张的生产中，充分地发挥了优越性。怒江区试办的六十七个农业社，提前半个月完成了栽种计划。佧佤族的西盟农业社比去年多开辟了三倍多的水田。各族农民亲眼看到农业社的好处后，纷纷要求走互助合作的道路。陇川县章凤乡相算社以它在春耕中所显示的优越性，带动佧佤等族的农民组织了三十九个互助组。元阳县倮铺乡有80％的哈尼、尼苏等族农户参加了互助组。红河自治区已完成土地改革的103个乡，参加互助组的农户也已达到60％以上。（据云南日报消息）
