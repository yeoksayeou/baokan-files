Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: Among the 275 ancient bronzes salvaged from scrap copper in Shanghai, a large *ding* (tripod cauldron), 39.7 cm high and 39.6 cm in diameter, has aroused great interest among archaeologists. The bronze ware special committee of the Palace Museum has identified this *ding* as a vessel from the Western Zhou Dynasty, 2,800 years ago. It has an inscription of 82 characters inside, recording the process of casting the *ding* at that time. It has now been listed as a masterpiece among the Palace Museum's collection of bronzes.

In order to carry out research on ancient bronzes, the Palace Museum has hired university professors and scholars from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jinan, Changchun, and Beijing, including Xu Senyu, Wang Xiantang, Guo Baojun, Rong Geng, Yu Shengwu, Shang Chengzuo, Chen Mengjia, and Tang Lan, to form a special committee on bronzes. This special committee held its first academic conference from August 10th to 23rd, discussing the identification, display, and preservation of bronzes, the salvage of ancient bronzes from scrap copper, and the carrying out of scientific research on bronzes.

Bronzes occupy a very important position in the history of Chinese culture and art, and the inscriptions on the vessels are valuable materials for studying Chinese history and ancient culture. The Palace Museum currently has a collection of more than 2,400 bronzes from the Shang and Zhou dynasties to the Qing Dynasty. The scholars identified more than 170 masterpieces from more than 1,400 bronzes during this process. During the identification process, heated and free debates were conducted on the era, authenticity, and names of some bronzes.

When discussing the display, collection, and preservation of bronzes, the scholars unanimously suggested that the Palace Museum should establish a bronze ware hall, and advocated focusing on displaying the most precious bronzes from the Shang and Zhou dynasties in China, so that the rich and valuable bronzes in the museum could be seen by the general public.

The scholars also believe that rescuing ancient bronzes from scrap copper is a very important task. They cited the examples of Shanghai, Dalian, and other places where treasures such as Lu ware and Xiaochen Zhai *gui* (food container) were picked up from scrap copper piles, indicating that there are many precious ancient cultural relics in scrap copper. They suggested that relevant departments pay attention to checking and preserving the country's cultural heritage when purchasing scrap copper, so as to prevent precious bronzes from being destroyed.

After this academic conference, the special committee on bronzes of the Palace Museum will compile a catalogue of the museum's collection of bronzes and successively compile illustrated books of bronzes.

    北京举行研究古代铜器的学术会议
    新华社23日讯　从上海市废铜中抢救出的二百七十五件古代铜器中有一个高三十九点七厘米、口径三十九点六厘米的大鼎，引起考古学者们极大的兴趣。这个大鼎经故宫博物院铜器专门委员会第一次会议的鉴定，肯定它是两千八百年前西周的器皿，鼎内有八十二个字的铭文，记叙了当时铸鼎的经过。它现已被列入故宫博物院收藏铜器的精品。
    故宫博物院为展开古代铜器研究工作，聘请了上海、广州、济南、长春和北京等地大学教授和学者徐森玉、王献唐、郭宝钧、容庚、于省吾、商承祚、陈梦家和唐兰等组成铜器专门委员会。这个专门委员会从八月十日至二十三日举行了第一次学术会议，讨论了铜器的鉴定、陈列、保管方法和从废铜中抢救古代铜器，以及开展关于铜器方面的科学研究工作等问题。
    铜器在我国文化艺术史上占有极重要的地位，器皿上的铭文又是研究我国历史和古代文化的珍贵资料。故宫博物院现已收藏商周至清代的铜器有两千四百多件。学者们这次从一千四百多件铜器中鉴定出一百七十多件精品。在鉴定过程中曾就一些青铜器的时代、真伪和名称等问题展开了热烈的自由争论。
    在讨论铜器陈列、征集、保管等问题时，学者们一致建议故宫博物院应成立铜器馆，并主张重点陈列我国最珍贵的商周时代的青铜器，使院藏的丰富而宝贵的铜器能和广大观众见面。
    学者们还认为，从废铜中抢救古代铜器是一项十分重要的工作。他们列举上海、旅大等地从废铜堆里拾出有鲁器、小臣宅簋等珍品，说明废铜中是有不少珍贵的古代文物的。他们建议有关部门注意在收购废铜时检查和保留国家的文化遗产，使珍贵的铜器免于销毁。
    在这次学术会议以后，故宫博物院铜器专门委员会将要编制院藏铜器藏品目录，并陆续编辑青铜器图谱。
