Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd. Chinese and foreign artists, many peace advocates, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China appreciated the immortal masterpieces of Sesshū, the world-renowned cultural figure and outstanding Japanese painter, at the opening of the Sesshū 450th Anniversary Memorial Exhibition here on the 23rd.

	The opening ceremony of this exhibition was held on the morning of the 23rd at the Art Exhibition Hall of the Chinese Artists Association. Yamaguchi Hoshun, a famous Japanese painter who came to China to participate in the Sesshū memorial activities, cut the ribbon amidst warm applause. Then, Yamaguchi Hoshun, together with Kitagawa Momoo, a famous Japanese art critic, and Hashimoto Meiji, a famous painter, who also came to China to participate in the Sesshū memorial activities, guided the guests into the exhibition. They introduced the characteristics of Sesshū's works to Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and many painters who came to visit. Yamaguchi Hoshun enthusiastically told the Chinese painters that he was even happier to exhibit Sesshū's works in China than in other countries because Sesshū's paintings had a close relationship with Chinese paintings, and Chinese people could understand his works more profoundly.

	The exhibition featured 54 reproductions of Sesshū's posthumous works and many books and periodicals introducing Sesshū. Many of the exhibits were donated by the Sesshū 450th Anniversary Memorial Society of Japan. The exhibits included Sesshū's most skilled landscape paintings, as well as his figure paintings and flower-and-bird paintings. Many visitors crowded in front of Sesshū's masterpieces such as "Long Scroll of Landscape in Four Seasons," "Huike Severing His Arm," "Portrait of Masuda Kanetaka," and "Folding Screen of Flower and Bird Paintings." Fu Baoshi, a Chinese painter who has been studying Sesshū's works since 1932, told reporters at the exhibition that Sesshū absorbed the strengths of Chinese painting and brilliantly formed his own national style. This spirit of creatively developing the excellent traditions of national painting is what we should learn from.

	This exhibition is jointly organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China

    雪舟纪念展览会在北京揭幕
    新华社23日讯　中国和外国的美术家们、许多和平人士以及各国驻华外交官员，二十三日在这里揭幕的世界文化名人、日本杰出画家雪舟逝世四百五十周年纪念展览会上，欣赏了雪舟的不朽名作。
    这个展览会的揭幕式，二十三日上午在中国美术家协会的美术展览馆举行。前来中国参加雪舟纪念活动的日本著名画家山口蓬春在热烈的掌声中剪采。接着，山口蓬春和同来中国参加雪舟纪念活动的日本著名美术评论家北川桃雄、著名画家桥本明治引导来宾们入场参观。他们向前来参观的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通和许多画家们介绍雪舟作品的特点。山口蓬春热情地向中国画家们说，在中国展览雪舟的作品，比在其他国家展览雪舟的作品，更使他感到高兴；因为雪舟的画同中国画有着亲密的关系，中国人能够更深刻地理解他的作品。
    展览会上共展出了雪舟遗作的复制品五十四幅以及许多介绍雪舟的书刊。展品中有不少是日本雪舟四百五十周年纪念会寄赠的。展品中包括雪舟最擅长的山水画，以及他的人物画和花鸟画。在雪舟杰作“四季山水图长卷”、“慧可断臂图”、“益田兼尧像”和“花鸟图屏风”等的前面，拥挤着很多参观者。从1932年就开始研究雪舟作品的国画家傅抱石在展览会上对记者说，雪舟吸收中国绘画的长处，出色地形成了自己的民族风格。这种创造性地发扬民族绘画优秀传统的精神是我们应当学习的。
    这个展览会，是中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国美术家协会联合举办的。它预定展出十八天。
    为了纪念这个展览会的开幕，中国美术家协会在二十三日晚上举行酒会。酒会上，中国画家同正在北京访问的日本画家以及外国画家们见了面。
