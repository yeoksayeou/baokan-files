Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Supplementary School Receives Returned Students

Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Students’ Middle School Supplementary School has been continuously expanding its scale since its establishment in 1954. The basic construction projects, which started in the autumn of 1954, have completed student dormitories, classroom buildings, office buildings, auditoriums, gymnasiums, and bathhouses, covering an area of more than 27,000 square meters. This year, a science museum and a library are also being added.

This year, the school has more than 1,440 students formally enrolled in classes, and it has also received more than 1,000 newly returned Overseas Chinese students during the summer vacation. In order to better receive and handle the enrollment work of returned Overseas Chinese students, the school has established a "Returned Overseas Chinese Students Entrance Examination Committee for Secondary Schools," which is responsible for unified enrollment examinations and assigning Overseas Chinese students to schools. Students admitted after the examination will be assigned to study in secondary schools in major and medium-sized cities, while those not admitted will stay in school for further supplementary studies. The Admissions Committee also receives Overseas Chinese students returning to China to apply for universities and colleges and handles their application procedures on their behalf. This year, 137 students from the school applied for secondary vocational schools, and 110 of them have been admitted and assigned to study in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places. Of the 1,760 students who applied for the first unified examination for ordinary middle schools, 1,256 were admitted and will be assigned to middle schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chongqing and other places.

    广州华侨补习学校接待回国学生
    广州归国华侨学生中等补习学校自1954年成立以来，规模不断扩大。基本建设工程从1954年秋天开始到现在，建成的有学生宿舍、课室大楼、办公大楼、礼堂、健身房以及浴室等，占地二万七千多平方公尺。今年还增建一座科学馆和一座图书馆。
    今年全校正式编班上课的学生有一千四百四十多人，暑期里又接待了一千多名刚归国的华侨学生。为了能够更好地接待和处理归国华侨学生的升学工作，该校成立了“归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会”，负责统一招生考试和分送侨生入学的工作。考试后被录取的学生即分配在各大、中城市中等学校学习，未录取的则留校继续补习。回国报考高等学校的华侨学生，也由招生委员会接待，并代办报考手续。今年该校报考中等专业学校的学生有一百三十七人，其中一百一十人已经录取，分配在上海、广州、武汉等地学习。报考普通中学第一次统一考试的一千七百六十名学生，有一千二百五十六人被录取，即将分配在北京、天津、青岛、上海、杭州以及重庆等地的中学学习。（附图片）
