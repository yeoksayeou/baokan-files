Just as we have visited and developed friendly relations with China, we believe that our two neighboring countries can help each other economically."

However, for nearly a century in the past, imperialism separated us and kept us apart. Now, imperialism has been driven away, and our country has regained its independence. We believe that the time has come for us to restore our brotherly relationship. Your visit this time will pave the way for the restoration of this relationship.

If these issues are resolved well, it will further consolidate peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world."
