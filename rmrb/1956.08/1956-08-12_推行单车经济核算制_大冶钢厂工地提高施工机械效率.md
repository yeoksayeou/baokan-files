Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 10th: The construction machinery station at the Daye Steel Plant expansion site has implemented a single-vehicle economic accounting system, greatly improving the efficiency of construction machinery. In the first half of this year, the mechanical attendance rate of this construction machinery station reached over 89%, and it was listed as the unit with the highest mechanical attendance rate in the country at the National Construction Machinery Management Work Conference. They also maintained such a high mechanical attendance rate in July.

The single-vehicle economic accounting system is an economic accounting system implemented on a per-machine basis. Since September of last year, this construction machinery station has begun to implement this system on more than 50 earthmoving machines, with five quotas set for each machine, including output, fuel consumption, and minor repair costs. This system encourages workers to improve machinery operation and pay attention to machinery maintenance. As a result, machinery damage on the construction site has been significantly reduced.

Due to the significant improvement in mechanical attendance rate, this construction machinery station has not only completed the state plan every month this year, but also increased workers' wage income by 17% to 30% compared with their basic wages.

From August, this construction machinery station has fully promoted the experience of implementing the single-vehicle economic accounting system for earthmoving machinery to hoisting machinery, power machinery and other construction machinery on the construction site.

    推行单车经济核算制
    大冶钢厂工地提高施工机械效率
    据新华社武汉10日电　大冶钢厂扩建工地上的建筑机械站推行单车经济核算制，大大提高了建筑机械的使用效率。今年上半年，这个建筑机械站的机械出勤率高达89％以上，在全国建筑机械管理工作会议上，被列为全国机械出勤率最高的单位。七月份他们也保持了这样高的机械出勤率。
    单车经济核算制是以每台机械为单位实行经济核算制度。从去年九月起，这个建筑机械站开始在五十多部土方机械上推行这种制度，每部机械都实行了产量、油料消耗、小修费用等五项定额。这种制度鼓励着工人们改进机械操作和注意保养机械。因此，工地上机械损坏现象显著减少。
    由于机械出勤率显著提高，今年这个建筑机械站不仅月月完成了国家计划，工人们的工资收入也比基本工资增加了17％到30％。
    从八月份起，这个建筑机械站已经把土方机械推行单车经济核算制的经验，在工地上的起重机械、动力机械和其他施工机械中全面推广了。
