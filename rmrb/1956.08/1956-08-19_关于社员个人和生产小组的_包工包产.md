On "Contracting Work and Output" to Individual Commune Members and Production Teams
    Yu Xin

    Currently, in some cooperatives' production teams, designated responsibility areas have been divided, with some crops or scattered small plots of land contracted to individual commune members, and crops on fixed plots of land in general areas contracted to permanently fixed production teams. Some cooperatives' production teams, after fixing responsibility areas, have also stipulated certain output quotas, contracting them to production teams or individual commune members. The benefit of this approach is that production responsibilities become more specific, work quality is easier to guarantee, and the problem of wasted labor can be overcome. Some comrades also call this approach "contracting work and output." I believe that this type of "contracting work and output" should be distinguished from the commonly referred to "contracting work and output" (where the production team contracts a certain output to the management committee and receives a certain remuneration, and receives a reward for exceeding the contracted output). It is best not to call this approach "contracting work and output."

    The production team is the basic unit of labor organization in an agricultural cooperative and a complete production unit. It can do all the work on the land it contracts. Production teams and commune members cannot do all the work that needs to be done on the contracted land throughout the year; they can only do most or some of this work. Plowing, sowing, harvesting, and some time-sensitive tasks require the production team to allocate people in a unified manner; some non-field production work also requires the production team to draw people. Therefore, when implementing "contracting work and output" to teams and individual commune members, it is inappropriate to hand over all the work in the assigned areas to teams and individuals. It is also inappropriate to distribute all land to commune members regardless of the circumstances, as this would become "organizing for individual farming."

    Because teams and individual commune members cannot continuously do all the work on the allocated land throughout the year, teams and individual commune members should not be allowed to "contract output," and they should not be held largely responsible for output. Otherwise, the production activities of commune members or teams will conflict with the production team's unified allocation of labor, hindering the advantages of collective production from being brought into play.

    关于社员个人和生产小组的“包工包产”
    羽心
    现在，一些合作社的生产队，划分了责任地段，把一些作物或零星的小块土地包给社员个人，把一般土地上已定地段的作物包给长年固定的生产小组；有的合作社的生产队，在固定责任地段以后，又规定了一定的产量，包给生产小组或社员个人。这样做的好处是生产责任更加具体，工作质量容易保证，可以克服窝工的毛病。有的同志把这种作法也称为“包工包产”。我认为：应该把这种“包工包产”和通常所说的“包工包产”（生产队向管委会承包一定的产量，得到一定的报酬，超过承包的产量就得到奖励）加以区别，最好不要把这种作法叫做“包工包产”。
    生产队是农业社劳动组织的基本单位，是一个完整的生产班子，它可以做它承包的土地上的一切工作；生产小组和社员，都不可能做承包地段上长年所要做的一切工作，只能做这些工作的大部或一部。耕地、播种、收割和一些时间性较强的工作，都需要生产队统一调配人去做；一些非田间生产的工作，也需要由生产队抽人去做。因此，实行小组和社员个人的“包工包产”的时候，如果把分给的地段上的一切工作都交给小组和个人去做，那是不妥当的；不分情况地把一切土地都分给社员，也是不妥当的，这样做就成为“组织起来单干”了。
    因为小组和社员个人不能长年连续做分到的地段上的全部工作，所以不该让小组和社员个人“包产”，不可令小组和社员个人对产量负绝大部分责任。不然，就会使社员或小组的生产活动和生产队统一支配劳动力发生矛盾，妨碍集体生产的优越性的发挥。
