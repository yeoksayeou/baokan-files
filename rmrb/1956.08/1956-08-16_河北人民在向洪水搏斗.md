Hebei People Fight Against the Flood

By our reporters He Li and Wang Lin

On August 2nd, when the reporters traveled by train from Beijing to Baoding, the provincial capital of Hebei, the endless green fields and graceful trees made for a delightful scene. The land of the Hebei Plain is so rich and beautiful! Who knew that three consecutive days of heavy rain starting on August 3rd would turn some of the fertile fields into a vast expanse of water? According to preliminary information from the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, as of August 10th, more than thirty counties had suffered varying degrees of flood damage.

Looking at a map, you can see that the western and northern parts of Hebei are mountainous, while the central, eastern, and southern parts are the famous Hebei Plain. All the rivers in the province flow east or northeast into the sea. There are very few forests in the mountains of northwestern Hebei. A little heavy rain often brings floods carrying large amounts of sand and soil. When the floods reach the plains, the sand and soil gradually settle, and the riverbeds rise year by year. The dikes on both sides also rise accordingly. Therefore, many of the rivers on the Hebei Plain are higher than the ground, making them very prone to flooding.

The annual rainfall in Hebei Province is unevenly distributed. The province's annual average rainfall is 342 mm to 626 mm, of which 70% is concentrated in July and August. This year, the rainfall has been particularly heavy and concentrated. From July 29th to August 4th alone, west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, from Zhangjiakou in the north to Handan Prefecture in the south, the general rainfall was over 300 mm. In Zijingguan, upstream of the Daqing River, the rainfall reached 722.1 mm by 8:00 AM on the 9th. This is also one of the main reasons for the flooding.

Due to the difference in slope and flow rate between the mountains and the plains, the rivers are often congested and overflow mid-course, giving most rivers in the plains a significant characteristic: high flow upstream and low flow downstream. For example, the Hai River itself is responsible for draining the water from the five main streams and countless tributaries above it, but the Hai River itself can only accommodate a flow of 2,000 cubic meters per second. However, the Hutuo River at Huangbizhuang alone accommodated 11,500 cubic meters per second this year (this area is hilly and can accommodate a huge flow). Such a large flow upstream simply cannot be accommodated downstream.

In the Nan Canal River basin, the guaranteed flow at Guantai, upstream of the Zhang River, is 1,500 cubic meters per second, while the flow of the Nan Canal is only 50 cubic meters per second. In the past, the highest flow at Guantai only reached 4,000 cubic meters per second. This year, on August 4th, it surged to 8,600 cubic meters per second, almost five times the guaranteed flow. Such a large flood simply could not be contained by the river. The river here is two to three meters higher than the ground, so when the flood peak came, the dikes on the Zhang River breached first in six places from Weixian County to Daming County, and the five counties of Daming, Weixian, Handan, Yongnian, and Quzhou along the river were immediately flooded. Following the Zhang River, the Hutuo River and Fuyang River upstream of the Ziya River, the Juma River on the Daqing River, and many rivers above Baiyangdian, as well as the Yongding River, successively breached their banks. The four prefectures of Handan, Xingtai, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, and more than twenty counties were successively flooded. In addition to overflowing in the upper reaches, these rivers continued to advance towards Cangxian and Tianjin prefectures in the middle and lower reaches. The Nan Canal River, Ziya River, and Daqing River also successively broke through their dikes, and more than a dozen counties were flooded.

The floods in Hebei have historical roots. Before liberation, the reactionary rulers allowed the rivers to silt up and did not repair the dikes, so the people were constantly threatened by floods. In 1939, a rainstorm flooded 70 million mu of land in the province, and Tianjin was flooded for two months. Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the Party and the People's Government, various flood control and drainage works have been carried out, such as strengthening dikes, establishing a planned flood control system, building the Guanting Reservoir upstream of the Yongding River, carrying out river channel management in the middle and lower reaches of the Chaobai River and Yongding River, and excavating the Duliu Reduction River and Sinu Temple Reduction River in the lower reaches of the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Nan Canal River. The Zhao Wang New Canal is also being excavated downstream of Baiyangdian to store and discharge floodwater. In terms of drainage, more than twenty drainage projects such as the Heilonggang River, Liangshui River, Longfeng River, and Qingjinghuang have been completed. Some soil and water conservation work has also been carried out in the mountainous areas, such as building valley dams and small reservoirs, digging ditches and ridges, and leveling terraced fields. Some ditch-furrow ridge fields have also been promoted in the plains. These works have played a certain role in flood control and drainage. Disasters as large as the one in 1939 have been avoided, and Beijing, Tianjin, the Jinpu Railway, and the Beijing-Hankou Railway have been secured. It should be said that Hebei's water management work has been successful. However, due to extremely unfavorable natural conditions, there are still floods of varying degrees every year.

The disaster situation in Hebei is serious, but the broad masses of the people of Hebei have not succumbed to the flood. Under the leadership of the Hebei Party and government organs, they have launched a fierce battle against the flood. Since the flood surge, the province's flood control team has rapidly increased from 500,000 to 1.5 million people. In the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, all the staff of the Water Conservancy Department and the headquarters stayed by the phone day and night to study the water situation and direct the struggle. When the flood flow at Guantai upstream of the Zhang River reached 8,600 cubic meters per second on the 4th (more than four times the guaranteed flow), they directed the flood control team along the Zhang River to build a second line of defense. When they learned that the upstream flow of the Hutuo River was equal to five times the downstream guaranteed flow, they decided to divert the flood at five places on the right bank, including Luotun and Chenggan, to protect the central Hebei Plain. On the 7th, the left bank of the Yongding River breached at the Mag 각 village section in Daxing County. Xu Zheng, the director of the Water Conservancy Department, immediately led technical cadres to the breach to organize the blocking and guided the flood into the Yongding River flood area to ensure the safety of the Jingshan Railway. Flood control teams everywhere worked day and night to carry out the struggle of "raising dikes as the water rises" and "dredging water back to the channel." All levels of leading organs, economic enterprises, and transportation departments throughout the province organized wooden boats, rafts, dustpans, and all other available water transportation tools to transport living materials to the villages surrounded by floods and rescue the disaster-stricken people. The grain and transportation departments of Baoding Prefecture alone had collected 4.96 million catties of grain by August 9th, of which 750,000 catties had been transported to the disaster villages. To overcome the difficulty of insufficient water transportation tools, airplanes sent by the Central Government flew to disaster villages with cut-off transportation lines to airdrop life jackets and cooked food. Hundreds of rubber boats carrying the province's and prefectures' comfort delegations and large quantities of living materials sailed to the disaster villages. Naval units stationed in a certain area also dispatched ships to participate in the rescue of the victims.

At present, the Party and government leading organs at all levels in the heavily affected Xingtai, Handan, and Tongxian prefectures are leading farmers to drain water on the one hand and helping disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives to arrange production on the other. In Handan Prefecture alone, more than one million mu of land had been drained by August 11th. In the dewatered areas, farmers are carrying out seedling support and soil cultivation for crops that can be saved. In addition to tidying up the remaining autumn crops, late-maturing crops are also being sown in a timely manner. The Jinzhai Township Agricultural Cooperative in Shexian County has planted more than 100 mu of vegetables and other crops. The Huozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Quzhou County quickly arranged production after the disaster. Now all the members of the cooperative have actively taken action.

With the care and support of the Central Government and the leadership of the Hebei Party and government organs, the people of Hebei are continuing to fight against the flood.

    河北人民在向洪水搏斗
    本报记者　贺笠　王林
    八月二日，当记者从北京乘车驰赴河北省城保定的时候，沿途一望无际的绿野，袅娜多姿的树木，景色宜人，使人应接不暇。河北平原的土地，是多么富饶而美丽啊！谁知从八月三日起接连三天大雨，就把一些良田，变成了一片汪洋。据河北省防汛指挥部初步了解的情况，截至八月十日止，有三十多个县遭受了不同程度的水害。
    展开地图可以看到，河北地区的西部和北部都是山地，中部、东部和南部，是有名的河北大平原。全省的水流，都向东或东北方汇集入海。河北西北的山区森林极少，稍降大雨，洪水常挟大量沙土而下，到了平原，沙土逐渐下沉，河床逐年淤高，两岸的堤防也随着上升，因此河北平原上的河道，很多都高出地面，极易泛滥。
    河北省全年降雨量分配不匀。全省年平均雨量是342公厘至626公厘，其中70％都集中在七、八月份，特别是今年雨量大，而且非常集中，仅自七月二十九日至八月四日，在京汉路西，北起张家口，南至邯郸专区，一般降雨量都在三百公厘以上，在大清河上游紫荆关，至九日八时，竟下雨722.1公厘。这也是发生洪水的主要原因之一。
    由于山区和平原河身坡度和河水流速的差异，河水中途拥塞漫溢，使得平原的多数河流具有一个重大的特点：上头流量大，下头流量小。如海河本身，是担负着流泄上面五条干流及无数支流的水量的，而海河本身所能容纳的流量只有二千秒公方，而上游仅滹沱河黄壁庄今年即容纳了11，500秒公方（这里是丘陵地带可以容纳巨大流量）。像上游这样大的流量，下游无论如何是不能承纳的。
    南运河流域，在漳河上游观台的保证流量是一千五百秒公方，而南运河的流量只五十秒公方；过去观台的最高流量，也只达到过四千秒公方，今年八月四日，竟涨到八千六百秒公方，比保证流量几乎大五倍，像这样大的洪水，河身无论如何是不能承泄的，这里的河身都高出地面二、三公尺，所以这次洪峰一来，漳河从魏县到大名一段，就有六处堤防首先决口，沿河大名、魏县、邯郸、永年、曲周五县随即被淹。紧跟漳河以后，子牙河上游的滹沱河、滏阳河、大清河上的拒马河和白洋淀以上的许多河流，以及永定河都相继溃决，邯郸、邢台、保定、石家庄四个专区二十几个县相继被淹，这些河水除在上流漫溢以外，并继续向中下游沧县、天津两专区前进；南运河、子牙河、大清河也相继决破堤防，又有十几个县被淹。
    河北的水灾是带有历史性的，解放以前，反动统治者对河身任其淤积，堤防不加修浚，人民经常受到水患的威胁。1939年一次暴雨，就使全省土地淹没七千万亩，天津市被洪水浸渍达两个月。自解放以后，由于党和人民政府的努力，进行了各种防洪排涝工作，如加强堤防，有计划地建立防汛体系，在永定河的上游修筑了官厅水库，在潮白河、永定河中下游进行了河道整理，在大清河、子牙河、南运河的下游开凿了独流减河和四女寺减河，在白洋淀的下游也在开凿赵王新渠，以蓄泄洪水。在防涝方面，先后完成了黑龙港河、凉水河、龙凤河、青静黄等二十余处排水工程，在山区也进行了一部分水土保持工作，如修建谷坊和小水库、挖沟埂、平整梯田等，在平原上也推广了一部分沟洫畦田，这些工作都对防洪排涝起了一定作用，像1939年那样大的灾害是避免了，北京、天津，津浦铁路、京汉铁路都得到安全。应该说河北的治水工作是有成绩的。但是由于自然条件的极为不利，每年仍有程度不同的水患。
    河北省的灾情是严重的，但是河北的广大人民并没有在洪水面前屈服，他们在河北党、政机关的领导下，向洪水展开了激烈的搏斗。自从洪水暴涨以后，全省沿河防汛队伍由五十万人迅速增加到一百五十万人。在河北省的防汛指挥部里，水利厅和指挥部的全体工作人员昼夜不停地守在电话跟前研究水情，指挥斗争。四日漳河上游观台的洪水流量达到了八千六百秒公方时（超过保证流量四倍以上），他们就指挥漳河沿线的防汛队伍赶筑二道防线。当他们了解到滹沱河上游流量已经等于下游保证流量五倍的时候，他们就决定在右岸罗屯、呈干等五处分洪，以保卫冀中平原。七日，永定河左堤大兴县麻各庄段决口了，水利厅厅长徐正，立即率领技术干部赶往决口地点组织抢堵，并引导洪水流入永定河泛区，保证京山铁路的安全。各地的防汛队伍，夜以继日的进行着“水涨堤高”和“疏水归道”的斗争。全省各级领导机关及经济企业和交通运输部门，组织了木船、木筏、簸箩等一切可以利用的水上交通工具，向被洪水围困地区的村庄，赶运生活物资，抢救受灾人民。仅保定专区的粮食和运输部门，到八月九日就集中了496万斤粮食，其中有七十五万斤已运往灾村。为克服水上交通工具不足的困难，中央派遣的飞机连日飞往交通断绝的灾村空投救生衣和熟食；成百只的橡皮船载着省、专区的慰问团人员和大批生活物资，源源驶往灾村。驻某地的海军部队，也出动了船只，参加抢救灾民工作。
    目前，受灾较重的邢台、邯郸、通县等专区各级党、政领导机关，一面领导农民排水，一面帮助受灾农业社安排生产。仅邯郸专区到八月十一日，已排水脱地一百多万亩。已脱水地区的农民，对能抢救活的庄稼，正进行扶苗、培土；没有收成的庄稼，除收拾残秋外，还及时播种晚熟作物。涉县金寨乡农业社已种上了一百多亩蔬菜等农作物。曲周县霍庄农业社，在受灾后迅速安排了生产，现在全社社员都已积极行动起来。
    在中央的关怀支援下和河北党、政机关的领导下，河北人民正在继续向洪水搏斗中。
