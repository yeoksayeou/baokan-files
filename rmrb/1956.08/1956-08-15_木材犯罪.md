    Timber Crime
    Shi Liuming
    Recently, reports from various places indicate that work-related casualties in production enterprises and basic construction sites have increased compared to last year. Consequently, many articles analyze the reasons, and the conclusion is consistent: insufficient concern for people.
    The views of some unit leaders are not entirely consistent with this conclusion. Here, I'll mention an example from two months ago, which is quite peculiar. A worker at the Baotou City Transportation Company was killed when a toppled truck of timber fell on him during loading. The Transportation Company issued a document analyzing the accident, stating: "The direct perpetrator was the timber, and there was no third party involved in causing the accident; according to the law, the direct perpetrator should be sentenced, but timber is not an object of dictatorship, so the deceased must bear full responsibility." According to this logic, who would be responsible for casualties? That would be: machines, vehicles, water, fire, electricity...
    However, aren't there many enterprises that have prevented accidents by adopting various safety measures? This is certainly not the result of the efforts of timber, machines, or vehicles. The key, I'm afraid, is whether the enterprise leaders care about people. Therefore, if casualties occur, or the number of accidents increases, the leaders of the enterprise cannot shirk responsibility.

    木材犯罪

    最近各地报载，生产企业和基本建设工地的人身伤亡事故，比去年有所增加。于是，有许多文章都来分析原因，结论是一致的：对人的关心不够。
    某些单位领导人的看法，同这个结论不大一致。在这里顺手举一个两个月以前的例子，而且是一个很奇特的例子。包头市运输公司的一个工人，在装木材的时候，被翻倒的大车压死了。运输公司有一个文件，在分析这件事故的时候写道：“直接犯罪者是木材，并无造成事故的第三者；按法律，直接肇事者本应判刑，但木材不是专政对象，所以只得死亡者完全负责。”按照这个逻辑，谁会对伤亡事故负责呢？那就是：机器、车辆、水、火、电……。
    可是，不也有不少的企业，由于采用了多种安全措施，防止了事故的发生吗？这当然不是木材、机器、车辆努力的结果。关键恐怕还是企业领导者是否关心人。所以，发生了伤亡事故，或事故的次数增多了，企业的领导者是推卸不了责任的。
