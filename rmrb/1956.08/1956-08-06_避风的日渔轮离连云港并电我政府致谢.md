Xinhua News Agency, Lianyungang, 5th: The four Japanese fishing boats that sheltered in Lianyungang from the typhoon safely weathered the storm and left Lianyungang on the afternoon of the 4th.

After the Japanese fishing boats entered Lianyungang, they sent nine representatives ashore on the morning of the 3rd to visit the Xinhailian City Fisheries Association. Shenye Liyi, the representative of the Japanese fishing boats, expressed his deep gratitude to the Xinhailian City Fisheries Association for their care and assistance in purchasing heavy diesel oil and other items. He said: "I will tell all the fishermen in Nagasaki about the friendly concern of your country's Fisheries Association for us, and we will jointly write a letter to thank you." He also took out a draft telegram, requesting the Xinhailian City Fisheries Association to forward it to the Japan-China Fisheries Agreement Association in Japan, requesting a telegram to thank the China Fisheries Association in Beijing. That afternoon, the Xinhailian City Fisheries Association, at the request of the Japanese fishing boats and with the consent of the Lianyungang Port Authority, arranged for the port authority's clinic to treat Bentomura Teruyoshi, a crew member of the Naga Fishing Maru No. 6, for tonsillitis. Bentomura Teruyoshi had not eaten for three days, and his condition has improved after treatment.

At 1:20 p.m. on the 4th, with the help of the City Fisheries Association, the Japanese fishing boats completed their departure procedures and then slowly sailed out of the port, following our "National Day" pilot boat.

Xinhua News Agency, Lianyungang, 5th: The four Japanese fishing boats sheltering from the typhoon in Lianyungang sent telegrams on the 4th to the Government of the People's Republic of China, the China Fisheries Association, and the Xinhailian City Fisheries Association, thanking China for the care they received while sheltering from the storm.

The telegram stated: "Since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, our Japanese fishing boats have entered your country's Lianyungang for the first time to avoid typhoons. Because we were allowed to enter the port for refuge, we were not harmed by the typhoon and were able to remain safe and sound. This is entirely due to your assistance, which is a true manifestation of Sino-Japanese friendship. We extend our deepest respect."

The telegram also stated: "After entering the port, you not only informed us of the shoals in the port, but also guided us to safe anchorages, ensuring the safety of all crew members. Moreover, you solved the problem of heavy diesel oil, ice, and other necessary navigational supplies. Our gratitude cannot be expressed with words alone."

The telegram concluded: "Unfortunately, our Japanese government currently fails to understand our true intentions, so that the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement remains only a non-governmental arrangement. We hope that a government agreement will be reached as soon as possible, so that China and Japan can be friendly, join hands, and strive for common prosperity!"

    避风的日渔轮离连云港并电我政府致谢
    据新华社连云港5日电　在连云港躲避台风的四只日本渔轮，安全避过台风的侵袭，在四日下午离开连云港。
    日本渔轮进入连云港以后，在三日上午派出九名代表登岸访问新海连市渔业协会。日本渔轮代表神野利一对新海连市渔业协会对他们的照顾和帮助他们购买重柴油等物品，表示十分感谢。他说：“我要把贵国渔业协会对我们友好的关怀，告诉全长崎的渔民，并要联名写信感谢你们。”他又拿出一份电报稿，请求新海连市渔业协会代为发给日本日中渔业协议会，请求来电向北京中国渔业协会致谢。当天下午，新海连市渔业协会，根据日本渔轮请求，经连云港港务局协商同意，由港务局医疗所替长渔丸六号船员本村照义医治扁桃腺炎。本村照义已经三天没有进餐，经过治疗以后，病况已好转。
    四日下午一时二十分，日本渔轮在市渔业协会的帮助下，办理出港手续，继而随我国“国庆号”领港船徐徐向港外驶去。
    新华社连云港5日电　在连云港躲避台风的四艘日本渔轮四日打电报给中华人民共和国政府、中国渔业协会和新海连市渔业协会，感谢中国在他们避风时所给的照顾。
    电文中说：“我们日本渔轮自中日渔业协定签订以来，为躲避台风，初次进入贵国连云港，因蒙准予进港避难，未受台风侵害，得以安全无事，这完全是蒙你们协助所致，这是中日友好的真实表现，特致以深厚的敬意。”
    电文中又说：“当入港后，不仅告知了港内的浅滩，又指导了安全锚地，保障全体船员的安全。不仅如此，对航海上必要的重柴油、冰等和其他的东西，都给解决了，这样不仅是表示感谢所能表达的。
    电文最后说：“不幸，现在我们的日本政府，对我们的真意不能理解，以使中日渔业协定还仅系民间形式，我们希望尽快的达成政府协定，中国与日本互相友好，握起手来，为共同的繁荣努力吧！”
