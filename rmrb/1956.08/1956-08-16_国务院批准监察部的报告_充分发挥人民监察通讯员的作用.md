Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The State Council recently approved the "Report on Adjusting the Establishment and Strengthening Leadership of People's Supervision Correspondents" from the Ministry of Supervision.

The report states: "Currently, our country is in the high tide of the great socialist revolution, and socialist construction and socialist transformation are accelerating. This requires more effective utilization of the supervisory role of people's supervision correspondents from the bottom up. The phenomenon of weak leadership and insufficient support for people's supervision correspondents by some supervisory organs needs to be corrected quickly." The report also states: "In order to fully utilize the role of people's supervision correspondents, supervisory organs at all levels must pay attention to and strengthen leadership over the work of people's supervision correspondents. The key to doing this work well lies in guiding people's supervision correspondents to report problems in a focused and systematic manner, while seriously addressing the problems they report." "People's supervision correspondents or correspondence groups with excellent achievements should be commended and rewarded."

The report says: "At present, the organizational form of the national supervision organs has changed, and the establishment of people's supervision correspondents should be adjusted accordingly." The report then says: "The adjustment of the organization of people's supervision correspondents should be based on the principle of 'paying attention to quality and focusing on key areas,' and people's supervision correspondents should be established in key areas and key enterprises as appropriate."

    充分发挥人民监察通讯员的作用
    新华社15日讯　国务院最近批准了监察部“关于对人民监察通讯员调整设置和加强领导的报告”。
    报告中说：“现在我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中，社会主义建设和社会主义改造正在加速进行，这就需要更加有效地发挥人民监察通讯员自下而上的监督作用。某些监察机关对人民监察通讯员领导薄弱和支持不力的现象，需要迅速加以纠正。”报告中又说：“为了充分发挥人民监察通讯员的作用，各级监察机关对于人民监察通讯员工作必须予以重视，加强领导。做好这一工作的关键问题在于及时指导人民监察通讯员有中心、有系统地反映问题，同时对于他们反映的问题认真地予以处理。”“对于有优良成绩的人民监察通讯员或通讯小组，应该注意予以表扬和奖励。”
    报告说：“目前，国家监察机关的组织形式已有改变，人民监察通讯员的设置应该作相应的调整。”报告接着说：“对于人民监察通讯员组织的调整，应该根据‘注意质量，重点设置’的原则，在重点地区、重点企业中酌量设置人民监察通讯员。”
