Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 13th: Pham Van Dong, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on August 10th, stating that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supports the Soviet Government's note of July 21, 1956, and suggests that the two chairmen advise the South Vietnamese regime to immediately announce the date for the commencement of consultations and the deadline for the implementation of general elections. If the South Vietnamese regime continues to maintain its attitude of refusing consultations and general elections, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two chairmen to reconvene the Geneva Conference, with the participation of the three member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, to discuss the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong referred to the letter of May 22nd from the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister, published by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 15th. He pointed out that, in this letter, although the South Vietnamese regime also expressed its support for peace and national reunification through free general elections, they still denied the Geneva Accords and did not respond to the two chairmen's suggestions regarding the date for commencing consultations and holding general elections to achieve national reunification. They used the excuse that North Vietnam does not have the conditions to prepare for and implement free general elections.

Pham Van Dong refuted this argument and said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agrees to implement the necessary guarantees for a truly free and democratic general election, as long as both sides reach an agreement at the consultative conference on the implementation of the basic principles of general elections mentioned in the letter from the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese regime on May 11th.

Pham Van Dong told the two chairmen that, due to the above-mentioned attitude of the South Vietnamese regime, consultations between the two regional regimes have not been held until now, free general elections nationwide in Vietnam have not been realized, the two chairmen's suggestions have not been implemented, the Geneva Accords have been seriously undermined, and peace in Vietnam is threatened. Pham Van Dong pointed out that the South Vietnamese regime must bear full responsibility for the above situation. The French government, in accordance with the Geneva Accords and the recommendations of the two chairmen, also bears its own responsibility.

Pham Van Dong reiterated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to strictly and thoroughly abide by and implement the Geneva Accords, and said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Geneva Accords must continue to be implemented and guaranteed by the parties concerned, and that in the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords, the issue of Vietnam's national reunification is of paramount importance. Only when the Vietnamese nation can be unified can peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia be consolidated.

    范文同写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
    如南越政权拒绝普选应重开日内瓦会议
    新华社河内13日电　越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同在八月十日写信给日内瓦会议两位主席说：越南民主共和国政府赞成苏联政府1956年7月21日的照会，并且建议两位主席建议南越政权立即告知开始协商的日期和实现普选的期限。如果南越政权继续保持它的拒绝协商和普选的态度的话，越南民主共和国政府要求两位主席重新召开有国际监督和监察委员会的三个成员国参加的日内瓦会议，以讨论日内瓦协定的履行。
    范文同提到日内瓦会议两位主席在七月十五日公布的南越外交部长的五月二十二日的信件。他指出，在这一信件中，虽然南越政权也表示赞成和平和通过自由普选来统一国家，但是，它们仍然否认日内瓦协定，并且对两位主席关于规定开始协商、举行普选实现国家的统一的日期的建议没有作出答复，它们借口说北越不具备筹备和实现自由普选的条件。
    范文同驳斥了这种论调，并且说，越南民主共和国政府同意实施对一个真正自由和民主的普选必要的保证，只要双方在协商会议上就越南民主共和国政府在五月十一日给南越政权的信中所提到的普选的基本原则的实现达成协议。
    范文同告诉两位主席，由于南越政权的上述态度，直到现在，两个地区政权之间的协商仍旧没有举行，越南全国范围内的自由普选仍旧没有实现，两位主席的建议仍旧没有得到执行，日内瓦协定遭到了严重的破坏，越南的和平受到了威胁。范文同指出，南越政权必须对上述情况负完全责任。法国政府按照日内瓦协定和按照两位主席的建议，也负有自己方面的责任。
    范文同重申越南民主共和国政府将继续严格和彻底地遵守和履行日内瓦协定，并且说：越南民主共和国政府认为，日内瓦协定必须得到有关方面继续履行并且保证其履行，而且在日内瓦协定的继续履行中，越南的国家统一的问题更是头等重要的问题。只有越南国家能够统一，越南、东南亚的和平才能得到巩固。
