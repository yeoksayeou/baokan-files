Is it "Urgently Needed for Work?"
Huang Chun
With the rapid advancement of our country's socialist construction, the demand for Russian translators is increasingly outstripping supply. In this situation, in addition to the education departments trying their best to cultivate more Russian translation talent, it is very important for user departments to make rational use of them so that every Russian translator can exert their maximum strength. However, some departments are not trying to narrow the gap between supply and demand, but are instead letting the gap widen, resulting in the accumulation and waste of talent.

In January of this year, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, citing "urgent need for work," requested the Higher Education Department to prematurely transfer thirteen graduating Russian majors from universities to work in the Competitive Sports Guidance Section of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. However, after these students arrived, they didn't have much to do. At that time, the explanation from the personnel department of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission was: "The comrades have just arrived, the work has not yet been arranged, so they may be relatively free for the time being, but things will be better when the work is on track." Later, the situation did not improve, but the overstaffing became more serious. Originally, some sports teams had three Russian translators for two Soviet experts. Later, due to the improvement of the translators' professional skills, one translator was enough for one expert, so the extra translator was assigned to do written translation work; however, there was not much written translation work for each sports team, and some teams even had no written translation work at all. What methods did the leaders use to relieve these comrades' distress from having nothing to do? They found some materials for these comrades to translate, only to find out after the translation that they had already been translated by others; another solution was to have them type, transcribe, and organize materials for evaluating athletes.

In February of this year, the Ministry of Labor also used the excuse of "urgent need for work" to ask the Higher Education Department to prematurely transfer eight Russian majors who were graduating this summer. However, after seven of them were assigned to the Ministry of Labor's expert studio, they quickly discovered that there was no shortage of translators there. The expert studio only had four Soviet experts, and there were already ten translators, so adding them made seventeen translators. What they translated there were only place names, company names, job titles, and simple forms and instructions, so the amount of translation work was very small, and most of the time was spent on typing and clipping materials. One wage expert was equipped with seven translators. How did these seven people work? One person was in charge of interpretation, four people were in charge of written translation, and the remaining two people had no translation work at all. When the comrade in charge of interpretation translated for the expert, the other six would sit in and listen, calling it "internship."

In the summer of 1955, seven Russian majors were assigned to work in the Yellow River Conservancy Commission of the Ministry of Water Resources. Apart from doing work for a Russian language training class for more than a month, they had never received any translation tasks. Because the leaders thought they were idle, they transferred them to serve as temporary teachers of Chinese language, natural science, and geography. They repeatedly raised their opinions, and recently the leaders finally agreed to send them back to the Ministry of Water Resources for reassignment. However, at the same time that this batch of Russian translators was being accumulated, the Ministry of Water Resources also requested the Higher Education Department to prematurely transfer fifteen Russian majors, citing "urgent need for work."

The above situation shows that some departments have serious departmentalism, only thinking about having more people to make things more convenient, and not considering how to use cadres more rationally and how to tap the potential of each cadre from the perspective of the needs of the entire country.

It is hoped that the leading comrades of relevant units will quickly check the situation of their units' use of Russian translation cadres and not allow the phenomenon of accumulation and waste of talent to continue to exist. The existence of these phenomena of wasting specialized talent in the high tide of socialist construction is really intolerable.

    是“工作急需”吗
    黄纯
    随着我国社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，俄文翻译人材越来越感到供不应求。在这种情况下，除了教育部门尽量设法多培养一些俄文翻译人材以外，用人部门如何合理使用，使每一个俄文翻译工作者发挥最大的力量是非常重要的事情。可是有些部门不是设法使供求之间的距离缩小，而是随便让供求之间的距离增大，造成了积压和浪费人材的现象。
    今年一月间体育运动委员会因为“工作急需”，要求高等教育部提前抽调高等学校俄文专业应届毕业生十三人到北京体育学院竞技指导科工作。可是这些学生到那里以后并没有多少事情可做。当时体育运动委员会人事部门的解释是：“同志们刚去不久，工作还没有安排就绪，暂时可能比较空闲，将来工作上了轨道就好了。”后来，情况也并没有什么改善，而是人浮于事的情况更加严重。原来有些运动队是三个俄文翻译担任两个苏联专家的翻译工作，后来由于翻译的业务水平提高，一个翻译跟一个专家就足够了，所以多余下来的一个翻译就固定作笔译工作；但是各个运动队的笔译工作并不多，甚至有的运动队没有笔译工作。领导上用什么办法来解除这些同志无事可做的苦恼呢？他们给这些同志找些材料翻译，等到翻译完才发现是别人已经译过的东西；另外就是让他们打字、抄写、整理给运动员评级的材料。
    劳动部在今年二月间也用“工作急需”的借口请高等教育部提前抽调八个今年暑假毕业的俄文专业学生，但是其中七个被分配去劳动部的专家工作室以后，他们很快就发现那里并不缺乏翻译，专家工作室只有四位苏联专家，原来已经有十个翻译，加上他们就是十七个翻译。他们在那里翻译的只是些地名、企业名称和职务名称以及简单的表格和说明等，因此翻译的工作量很少，而大部分的时间是用在打字和剪贴资料上。一位工资专家配备了七个翻译，这七个人怎样进行工作呢？一个人担任口译，四个人担任笔译，其余两个人就根本没有翻译工作，当口译的同志给专家翻译的时候，其余的六人都去旁听，名之为“见习”。
    1955年暑假有七个俄文专业毕业生被分配到水利部黄河水利委员会工作，他们到那里除了搞过一个多月的俄语训练班的工作以外，从来没有接受到什么翻译任务，领导上因为他们闲着没事做，就调他们去担任临时的语文、自然和地理教员。他们再三提出意见，最近领导方面才同意把他们送回水利部重新分配工作。可是就在这批俄文翻译被积压的同时，水利部却同样以“工作急需”为理由要求高等教育部提前抽调了十五个俄文专业的学生。
    以上情况说明，有的部门本位主义很严重，只想到人多一些，方便一些，而没有从整个国家的需要来考虑，怎样更合理地使用干部，怎样发挥每一个干部的潜在力。
    希望有关单位的领导同志赶快检查一下本单位使用俄文翻译干部的情况，不要让积压、浪费人材的现象继续存在下去。在社会主义建设的高潮中存在着这些浪费专门人材的现象，实在令人不能容忍。
