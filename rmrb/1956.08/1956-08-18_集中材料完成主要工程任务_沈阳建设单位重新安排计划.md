    Centralize Materials to Complete Key Engineering Tasks
    Shenyang Construction Units Reorganize Plans
    (Our Dispatch) The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently mobilized and organized all basic construction units in the city to carefully arrange their annual construction plans in order to ensure the completion of key construction engineering tasks.
    Shenyang's construction engineering tasks have been continuously increasing this year. As of August 14th, the total construction area had increased from over 900,000 square meters initially determined at the beginning of the year to over 1,650,000 square meters. Among these, projects constructed with state investment accounted for more than 70%, with the remainder being added beyond the state investment. This situation created a mismatch between construction materials, construction workforce, and construction tasks throughout the city. Taking the city's six major construction engineering companies as an example, over 80,000 square meters of civil engineering projects could not be started due to a lack of materials. The Northeast Second Engineering Company, which undertakes more than half of the city's engineering construction tasks, could only supply six-tenths of the steel it needed for the entire year. On the other hand, various construction units lacked thorough consideration of various subjective and objective conditions, and some projects that did not have the conditions for construction were also included in the plan. For example, some projects still do not have preliminary designs, or have investment but no projects, or have projects but no content, or although there are drawings, there is no source of materials, thus greatly affecting the completion of the plan. As of the beginning of August, only 45% of the annual plan had been completed.
    Therefore, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately organized and mobilized various construction and construction units, asking them to carefully arrange their construction plans based on the current material situation, and to include non-urgent projects in the reserve plan in order to concentrate construction materials to complete major projects. The effect of doing so is very good. For example, the six major construction engineering companies that undertake the city's construction tasks included 9% of the originally planned non-urgent civil buildings in the reserve plan, and used the materials from these projects for major projects. For example, the Second Engineering Section had an urgent project, but due to lack of materials, it was originally prepared not to do it. However, after this arrangement, the project started again.

    集中材料完成主要工程任务
    沈阳建设单位重新安排计划
    本报讯　中共沈阳市委员会，最近动员和组织全市各基本建设施工单位很好地安排全年施工计划，以保证完成主要的建设工程任务。
    沈阳市今年建设工程任务不断增加。到八月十四日，建筑总面积由年初确定的九十多万平方公尺增加到一百六十五万平方公尺以上。其中国家投资建设的工程占70％多，其余全部是在国家投资以外追加的。这样，全市便出现了建筑材料、施工力量与施工任务不相适应的局面。以全市六个大的建筑工程公司来看，因缺乏材料而不能施工的土建工程就有八万多平方公尺。担负全市工程建设任务一半以上的东北第二工程公司全年所需要钢材只能供应十分之六。另一方面，各建设单位对各种主客观条件又缺少周密考虑，一些没有条件施工的工程也列入了计划。比如有些工程至今尚无初步设计，或有投资无项目、或有项目无内容，或虽有图纸但材料确无来源，因此大大影响了计划的完成。到八月上旬止，只完成年计划的45％。
    因此，中共沈阳市委即组织、动员各建设和施工单位，要他们根据目前材料情况很好安排一下施工计划，可将不急需的工程列入储备计划里去，以集中建筑材料完成主要工程。这样做的效果是很好的。例如，负担全市建筑任务的六个大的建筑工程公司，把原计划中9％的不十分急需的民用建筑列入了储备计划，并将这些工程的材料用到主要工程上去。又如，第二工程处有一项急需的工程，因无材料，原准备不干，但经过这次安排，这项工程又开工了。　（辽宁日报）
