This was learned by reporters from various state-run import and export companies here. According to the authorities of these companies, in addition to preparing to continue fulfilling the contracts already signed by both parties, they are also continuing to negotiate and conclude various transactions with the Egyptian side.

    我国继续将成交货物输往埃及
    新华社11日讯　中国各国营进出口公司在英国当局最近管制了埃及的英镑存款后仍继续将已成交和待运的货物输往埃及。这是记者从这里的各个国营进出口公司处得悉的。据各公司当局称，他们除了准备继续履行双方已签订的合同外，并且还继续和埃及方面谈判和成交各种交易。
    按照中国和埃及在去年八月订立的贸易协定，中埃双方交易的货款是用英镑支付的。
