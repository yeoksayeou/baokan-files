Xinhua News Agency, Chongming, 6th: Farmers trapped on the small sandbars of Laoshusha, Yao'esha, and Nanfengsha around Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River during the strong typhoon have been safely returned home and transferred.

    Laoshusha, Yao'esha, and Nanfengsha are all small sandbars around Chongming Island. Most of these small sandbars are uninhabited, except for Nanfengsha, which has an agricultural production cooperative with two thousand mu of fields. In calm weather, farmers often sail small boats to these small sandbars to cut silk grass (a wild plant that can be used to make ropes). Before the arrival of the twelve-grade typhoon, more than one hundred farmers went to Yao'esha and Laoshusha to cut grass, taking only a small amount of food. They were suddenly caught in a strong typhoon, trapped on the small sandbars, and were on the verge of running out of food. In addition, the farmers living on Nanfengsha originally planned to move to Chongming Island to avoid the typhoon, but the transfer work had not yet started when the typhoon arrived.

    In this emergency, personnel sent by the Chongming County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered the people trapped on Laoshusha and Yao'esha, rescued them, gave them food, and sent them home. The people trapped on Nanfengsha, after being rescued by the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and cadres on the sandbar who disregarded their own safety, many farmers living in dangerous houses and flocks of chickens, ducks, and sheep were moved to the central area for shelter. Nanfengsha also safely weathered the strong typhoon, without any casualties.

    Now, all the male and female laborers on Nanfengsha are working together to repair the embankments. Because the embankments have been breached in several places, and the fifth high tide of the year is about to arrive, the Chongming County Committee of the Communist Party of China has taken measures to transfer more than one hundred elderly and children from Nanfengsha to a safe area on the afternoon of the 5th, and has prepared boats to transfer the people on the sandbar if it is flooded during the high tide.

    被台风困在小沙上的农民安全转移和回到崇明岛
    据新华社崇明6日电　在强台风袭击时被困在长江口上的崇明岛四周老鼠沙、药鹅沙和南峰沙等小沙土上的农民已安全回家和转移。
    老鼠沙、药鹅沙、南峰沙都是崇明岛周围的小沙。这些小沙多数都没有人烟，只有南峰沙上有一个有二千亩田的农业生产合作社。风平浪静的日子里，农民常常驾小船到这些小沙上割丝草（一种可以做绳子的野生植物）。这次十二级台风没有到来之前，有一百多名农民到药鹅沙、老鼠沙去割草，他们只带了少量的口粮，突然遇到强台风，困在小沙上，眼看就要断炊。另外，住居在南峰沙上的农民，本来打算转移到崇明岛上避风，但是转移工作还没有开始，台风就来了。
    在这紧急的时候，中共崇明县委派出的人员，发现了老鼠沙和药鹅沙上被困的人们，把他们抢救出来，给他们食物，并且送他们回家。在南峰沙上被困的人们，经过这个沙上的共产党员、青年团员和干部都奋不顾身地抢救，许多住在危险房屋里的农民和鸡、鸭、羊群迁到中心地带躲避，南峰沙也安全渡过强台风袭击，没有发生任何伤亡。
    现在南峰沙上的男女劳动力一齐出动，正在修圩。由于圩堤已决口数处，今年第五次大潮汛又将要到来，中共崇明县委已采取措施，在五日下午把南峰沙上一百多名老人小孩转移到安全地带，并且准备了船只，如果这个小沙在大潮来时受淹，就把沙上人员转移。
