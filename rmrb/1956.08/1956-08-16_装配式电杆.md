Prefabricated Concrete Poles

China has a long history of using reinforced concrete poles to erect power transmission lines. Compared to steel lattice towers, they are very economical. However, the main pole of this type of pole is eighteen meters long and weighs about two thousand kilograms, and most of the lines to be erected pass through desolate mountains and wild suburbs, areas rarely visited by people; some line projects even have to traverse virgin forest areas. Therefore, transporting the poles has become a very arduous task. In manufacturing, many difficulties also arise due to complex types and specifications.

Now, the Electric Power Design Institute has successfully designed a prefabricated reinforced concrete segmented pole. That is, the main pole of the reinforced concrete pole is divided into two, three, or four sections according to the region, engineering characteristics, and transportation conditions. Each section weighs 900, 600, or 400 kilograms, and can be transported by various means of transportation, and then assembled on the construction site.

Based on the law of lateral force on reinforced concrete, the designers have proposed new calculation theories and coefficients, changed the past unreasonable method of steel reinforcement configuration, and reduced the amount of steel used. After changing the ground wire suspension method to cross arms, the conductors were raised, the span between poles was enlarged, and fifty poles could be saved per hundred kilometers of line. In this way, more steel and cement can be saved, and investment in line construction can be saved.

    装配式电杆
    我国用钢筋混凝土电杆架设输电线路，由来已久。比起铁塔式电杆来，非常省钱。但是这种电杆的主杆长十八公尺，重约两千公斤，而架设的线路又多数是要通过荒山野郊，人迹罕到的地区；有些线路工程甚至还要横贯原始森林地带。因此运输电杆就成为一件非常艰巨的工作。在制造上，也因为型式和规范复杂而发生许多困难。
    现在，电力设计院设计成功一种装配式钢筋混凝土分节电杆。就是把钢筋混凝土电杆的主杆根据地区、工程特点和运输条件，分成二节、三节或四节，每节重九百、六百或四百多公斤，可以利用各种交通工具运输，运到工地再拼装起来。
    设计人员根据钢筋混凝土侧面受力的规律，提出了新的计算理论和系数，改变了过去不合理的钢筋配置方法，减少了钢筋的用量；把地线悬挂方法改为横担以后，导线升高了，电杆之间的档距放大，每百公里线路中就能省掉五十基电杆。这样，就能更多的节省钢材、水泥，节省线路建设的投资。
