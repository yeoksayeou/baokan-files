    At the All-Union Sports Games

    10,000-Meter Race Breaks All-Union Record

    At the opening ceremony of the All-Union Games of the Peoples of the Soviet Union, Soviet Honored Master of Sports, Kuz, broke the All-Union record for the 10,000-meter race with a time of twenty-eight minutes and fifty-seven and eight-tenths seconds. He is the first athlete to break a record after the opening of the All-Union Sports Games.

    After the race, Kuz said in a statement: "Although I have broken my own record and set an All-Union record, I am not satisfied with my performance, to be frank." Kuz's last sentence was pointed, because his time was fifteen seconds slower than the world record set by Hungarian, Iharos.

    Unexpected Water Polo Match

    On the morning of the 6th, the water polo championship was held in the swimming pool of the Central Stadium, with eighteen teams from various republics participating. When the announcer announced the water polo match between the Latvian team and the Tajik team, everyone had no doubt that the athletes from the Baltic Sea would defeat the Tajik team from the mountains.

    However, shortly after the start of the water polo match, people began to worry about the Latvian team instead. The Latvian team took the lead in the first half, but at the beginning of the second half, the Tajik team became more and more courageous, scoring four goals against the Latvian goal in succession. The water polo match ended with a score of four to two, with the unexpected victory of the Tajik team.

    Huge Press Corps

    The press center of the Central Stadium was crowded with Soviet and foreign journalists. Some were anxiously inquiring about news, and others were immersed in writing, which was very lively. Newspapers and news agencies from various countries attached great importance to the coverage of this All-Union Games. It is understood that there are a total of four hundred Soviet and foreign journalists covering the Games. Among the foreign journalists, there are not only journalists from People's Democratic countries, but also journalists from major news agencies in the capitalist world, such as the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse.

    Long-Distance Cycling Race

    In the evening, the first bicycle of the All-Union long-distance race appeared on the red avenue of the Central Stadium. The audience warmly cheered and welcomed the winner of the race. Moscow's young athlete, Kabinov, set an All-Union record in this competition. He completed the 2,662-kilometer race in sixty-eight hours, twenty-two minutes, and forty-two seconds.

    The final leg of the cycling race was from Gzhatsk, 176 kilometers from Moscow, to Moscow. A tense chase took place on this section. The sky was covered with dark clouds, and it rained heavily for two hours shortly afterwards, but the competitors followed one after another, continuing to race to Moscow at a high speed of 43 kilometers per hour.

       Two to Two

    The two most famous football teams in the Soviet Union, "Dynamo" and "Central House of the Soviet Army," played an extremely exciting All-Union football championship round match on the brand-new football field of the Central Stadium on the 5th. This match attracted more than 100,000 spectators. Moscow Television broadcast the entire match live. At the start of the match, the strong Soviet Army football team took the lead. Five minutes after the kick-off, the Soviet Army quickly attacked, threatening the opponent's goal and scoring a goal. The "Dynamo" team quickly counterattacked and also scored a goal. The Soviet Army organized another attack, using close passes and accurate shots, and scored a second goal against the "Dynamo" team. The first half ended amidst continuous applause.

    In the second half, both sides were in a state of intense mutual attack and strict defense. The audience was worried about whether the "Dynamo" team could turn the tide. At this time, a chance event occurred; the Soviet Army was penalized for a foul. The "Dynamo" team member hit the Soviet Army's goal with a rapid shot from eleven meters from the opponent's goal. The result of this tense match was two to two.

    在全苏运动大会上
    一万公尺长跑破全苏纪录
    在全苏各族人民运动大会开幕式上，苏联功勋运动员库兹以二十八分五十七秒八的成绩刷新了一万公尺全苏纪录。这是全苏运动大会开幕后第一个打破纪录的运动员。
    库兹在竞赛结束后发表谈话说：“虽然我刷新了自己的成绩并创造了全苏纪录。但是，坦白地说，我对自己的成绩并不满意。”库兹的最后一句话是有所指的，因为他的成绩比匈牙利人伊哈洛斯创造的世界纪录多十五秒。
    出人意外的水球赛
    六日上午，在中央运动场的游泳池举行水球冠军赛，有来自各共和国的十八个队参加。当报告员宣布拉脱维亚队和塔吉克队进行水球赛时，大家都毫不怀疑，来自波罗的海的运动员一定会打败来自山区的塔吉克队。
    但是水球赛开始后不久，人们都反而替拉脱维亚队担起心来了。上半场是拉脱维亚队占先，下半场一开始，塔吉克队越战越勇，先后四次破拉脱维亚球门。这次水球赛终以四比二、以出人意外的塔吉克队获胜而结束。
    庞大的记者队伍
    在中央运动场的新闻中心，挤满苏联记者和外国记者，有人在紧张地打听消息，有人在埋头书写，十分热闹。各国报纸和通讯社十分重视这次全苏规模的运动会的报道。据了解，来采访大会消息的苏联和外国记者共有四百人。在外国记者当中，不仅有人民民主国家的记者，还有资本主义世界的大通讯社，如美联社、合众社、国际新闻社、路透社、法新社的记者。
    长距离自行车比赛
    傍晚，中央体育场的红色大道上出现了第一辆全苏长距离比赛的自行车，观众热烈欢呼迎接了比赛胜利者。莫斯科年青运动员卡比诺夫在这次比赛中创造了全苏纪录。他以六十八小时二十二分四十二秒完成了二六六二公里的比赛路程。
    离莫斯科一七六公里的格柴斯克到莫斯科是自行车比赛的最后一段路程。在这一段进行了紧张的追赶。天空布满乌云，不久后即下了二小时大雨，但比赛者一个紧跟着一个，继续以每小时四十三公里的高速度奔到莫斯科。
       二比二
    全苏最有名的“狄纳莫”与“苏军中央之家”两个足球队，五日在中央体育场崭新的足球场上进行了一场极为精彩的全苏足球冠军轮赛。这场比赛吸引了十多万观众。莫斯科电视进行了全部比赛实况转播。比赛开始，阵容坚强的苏军足球队占了优势。开球后五分钟，苏军队迅速进攻，直逼对方球门，射进了一球。“狄纳莫”队迅速反攻，很快地也射进了一球。苏军队再次组织进攻，以紧密传球，准确射球，第二次射进了“狄纳莫”队球门。第一场在不断的掌声中就此结束。
    下半场比赛双方一直处在紧张的相互进攻和相互严密防守状态。观众们为“狄纳莫”队是否能挽回局势而担心。这时一个偶然事情发生了；苏军队因为犯规被罚球。“狄纳莫”队队员在对方球门十一公尺处以急速的射球命中了苏军球门。这场紧张的比赛结果是二比二。
