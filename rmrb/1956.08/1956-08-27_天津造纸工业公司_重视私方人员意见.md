Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 25th: The Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Owned Paper Mills have largely adopted and implemented 171 suggestions from private sector personnel regarding improving management and production.

    For example, private sector personnel such as Lao Jianren from the Xinhua Paper Mill, based on cost analysis, discovered a serious waste of water in the paper-making process. They suggested using recycled water for pulping. The factory leadership organized technical personnel to investigate and confirmed issues such as improper installation of water pipes and leaks in underground pipes. These issues were then corrected. Additionally, Lao Jianren's suggestion to use recycled water for pulping was adopted. Since July, this has saved over 1,700 yuan per month. At the Guanghua Paper Mill, private sector personnel such as Bao Wenfu, observing the high cost of glazed paper, proposed changing the raw material ratio. After research, the ratio was changed from 30% wood pulp and 70% reed pulp to 15% wood pulp and 85% reed pulp. Trial production showed that the paper quality fully met requirements, while the cost per ton of paper was reduced by 40 yuan. At the Zhongda Paper Mill, private sector personnel such as Sheng Ziliang pointed out that there was no plan for material usage in each workshop. Some workshops bought materials on an as-needed basis, while others had large stockpiles of materials. After discussion between the public and private sides, warehouse workers were added to each workshop or designated personnel were assigned to be responsible for material storage, initially correcting the chaotic warehouse management situation.

    These private sector personnel are relatively familiar with the company's situation. Since their opinions have been valued, their enthusiasm for work has increased.

    重视私方人员意见
    新华社天津25日电　天津市各个公私合营造纸厂私方人员提出的一百七十一件有关改进经营管理和改进生产的意见，绝大部分已经被采纳实现。
    新华造纸厂私方人员劳鉴人等，根据成本分析发现本厂造纸用水浪费现象很严重，又提出了利用回水制浆的建议。厂的领导上就组织技术人员进行检查，证明存在着自来水管安装不当、暗管漏水等问题，随即加以改进，同时采纳了劳鉴人等关于利用回水制浆的建议，从7月份以来每月可节约一千七百多元。光华造纸厂私方人员鲍文符鉴于有光纸的成本过高，提出改变原料的配方比例，经过研究，由原来木浆30％、苇浆70％的比例，改变为木浆15％、苇浆85％，试制结果，纸的质量完全合乎要求，每吨纸的成本却降低了四十元。中达造纸厂私方人员盛子良提出各车间用料无计划，有的车间现用现买，有的车间材料大量积压，经公私双方研究，在各车间增加了仓库工或指定专人负责材料保管，初步纠正了仓库管理的混乱现象。
    这些私方人员对企业的情况都比较熟悉，自从他们的意见受到重视以后，工作积极性更加高涨。
