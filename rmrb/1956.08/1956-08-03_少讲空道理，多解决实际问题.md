　　Three months ago, the people of Shulan County disliked the No. 2 Department Store of Shulan County. People often said: "The service attitude of the No. 2 Department Store's salespersons is not good, and you get a bellyful of anger when you spend money." Naturally, the customers of this store gradually became scarce.

　　The Party organization of the Shulan County Department Store and the manager of the store were also distressed, feeling that the store's salespersons were too backward and their individualistic thinking was too serious. Therefore, they held meetings to criticize ideology and lecture the salespersons on principles. However, it didn't cause any change. There was no response to the advanced producer movement.

　　In fact, the Party organization of the company did not find the real reason for the backward thinking of the salespersons. There were twenty-six employees in the No. 2 Department Store. Among them, some were advanced, and some were backward, with more backward than advanced; there were different reasons for being backward. Let's give a few examples:

　　Li Zhongzhi, a warehouse clerk, did not earn much each month, and his whole family of eight depended on him. Before the salary was paid, the money had already been borrowed and spent. He thought about this matter when he got off work and also when he was at work, so there were many mistakes when he was delivering goods. There were several people like Li Zhongzhi whose lives were very difficult, and their work situations were roughly the same.

　　The husband of female salesperson Zhang Yuxia worked in Ping'an Town. The two were far apart and could not be reunited for a long time, and the leadership did not allow her to go home for leave, so she could not concentrate on her work. There were also several people in this situation.

　　Another part of the people were mainly not interested in commercial work.

　　If these practical problems are not solved, and only ideological criticism is carried out, generally speaking about the consistency of individual interests and collective interests, the problem cannot be solved.

　　In early April, the Party小组 of the No. 2 Department Store specifically studied the ideological situation of the salespersons, found the root cause, and proposed a plan to the store manager to do ideological work on the basis of solving practical problems.

　　The manager considered this plan and thought it was correct, and his mind was clear. After asking the superior for approval, temporary relief was provided to salespersons with low wages and many family difficulties. A regular vacation system was implemented for employees whose spouses were not in the same place.

　　After doing this, the salespersons were very happy. At this time, the Party小组 used these specific facts to vividly publicize the consistency of individual interests and collective interests, and mobilized everyone to reverse the backwardness of the store. They also educated employees to unite and help each other at work and in life, and to promote the spirit of class friendship. For employees who were indeed not ideologically aware, Party members and activists helped and educated them individually.

　　In this way, the motivation of most salespersons was aroused. Mutual assistance among employees in work and life further promoted this progress. Once, Li Zhongzhi was temporarily assigned to work on the river embankment, and his family had no food to eat. Accountant Yang Zhenlian heard about it and automatically took 20 jin of millet from her own home to his home; the store's trade union also lent his family 30 yuan. Li Zhongzhi was very touched when he found out. He actively did his work and used excellent work performance to respond to the care of the Party and comrades for him. At the end of the work, he was rated as an advanced worker.

　　When people's mental burdens were relieved, their work attitude changed. In the past, some salespersons were "annoyed by questions" from customers, but now they were "never tired of answering" and even took the initiative to explain to customers. Once, a girl from Chaoyang Township came to the No. 2 Department Store to buy things for her wedding. As soon as she entered the door, the salespersons warmly received her, and she bought more than 110 yuan worth of goods. When she left, she said to the salesperson: "If your sales procedures were not simple and your service attitude was good, I would have gone to another store to buy them." In the past, relatively backward salespersons such as Zhou Shufang and Zheng Jinzhu were successively rated as advanced workers of the store in April and May, and twelve employees actively requested to join the Party.

　　The change in the ideology and service attitude of the salespersons reversed the bad impression left on the people of Shulan County, and the store's business gradually prospered. In the past two months, the completion of the sales plan of the No. 2 Department Store has greatly improved.

    少讲空道理，多解决实际问题
    晓林
    在三个月以前，吉林省舒兰县城的人，对舒兰县第二百货商店都不太满意。人们经常议论：“二百营业员的服务态度不好，花钱买东西还买来一肚子气。”自然，这个商店的顾客也就渐渐地稀少了。
    舒兰县百货公司的党组织和这个商店的经理也很苦恼，觉得这个商店的营业员太落后，个人主义思想太严重。于是，开会批判思想，向营业员讲道理。可是，并没有引起什么变化。先进生产者运动，有人号召无人响应。
    其实，公司的党组织没有找到营业员思想落后的真正原因。第二百货商店共有二十六个职工。其中有先进的，也有落后的，落后的多于先进的；落后和落后，还有不同的原因。举几个例子来说吧：
    出库员李忠智每月所挣的工薪不多，全家八口人靠他一个人养活，没等到发工薪的日子，钱早已借着花光了。下班是想着这个事，上班也是想这个事，货物出库的时候，就弄得差错百出了。像李忠智这样生活很困难的人，还有几个，工作状况也大体相同。
    女营业员张玉霞的爱人在平安镇工作。两人相距很远，长久不得团圆，领导上又不准假回家，工作安不下心来。像这样情况的人也有几个。
    另一部分人，主要是对商业工作不感兴趣。
    如果不解决这些实际问题，光批判思想，一般地从道理上讲个人利益和集体利益的一致性，问题是得不到解决的。
    四月初，第二百货商店的党小组具体地研究了营业员的思想情况，找到了根本的原因，向商店经理提出了在解决实际问题的基础上做好思想工作的方案。
    经理考虑了这个方案，认为是正确的，头脑也清楚了。请示上级批准，对工薪低、家庭生活困难多的营业员进行了临时救济。对爱人不在一地的职工实行了定期休假制。
    这样做了以后，营业员们很高兴。这时，党小组便以这些具体事实生动地宣传了个人利益和集体利益的一致性，动员大家扭转商店的落后面貌。还教育职工在工作上要团结互助，在生活上也要团结互助，发扬阶级友爱的精神。对于确实思想觉悟不高的职工，由党员和积极分子分头帮助和个别教育。
    这样，激发起了大多数营业员的上进心。职工之间在工作上、生活上的互助，更推动了这种进步。有一次，李忠智被临时分配到河堤上去工作，他家里没有吃粮了。会计杨振莲听说了后，就自动地从自己家里拿二十斤小米送到他家；商店工会还借给他家三十元钱。李忠智知道了以后，很受感动。他就积极地做工作，以优秀的工作成绩来回答党和同志们对他的关怀。工作结束的时候，他被评为先进工作者。
    人们精神上的负担解除了，工作态度也就变了。过去，有些营业员对顾客“一问就烦”，现在则是“百问不厌”，而且还主动地向顾客做解释。有一次，朝阳乡的一个姑娘，来到第二百货商店买结婚用的东西，一进门营业员就亲热地接待她，她买了110多元钱的货物。临走的时候，她对营业员说：“要不是你们卖货手续简便，服务态度好，我就到别的商店买去了。”过去，比较落后的营业员像周淑芳、郑金珠等，在四、五月份，都连续被评为商店的先进工作者，还有十二个职工积极要求入党。
    营业员的思想和服务态度的转变，扭转了给舒兰县城的人们留下的不好的印象，商店的营业渐渐地繁荣起来。近两个月来，第二百货商店完成卖货计划的情况大有好转。
