    The Fifth Representative Assembly of the Communist Youth League's Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Concludes
    Determines to Mobilize the Positive Factors of Youth to Do a Good Job in the Work of the Organs

    (Our Newspaper News) The Fifth Representative Assembly of the Communist Youth League's Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs was held in Beijing from August 21st to 27th. This assembly determined to take fully developing democracy, organizing youth to persistently and tirelessly advance towards science and culture, and mobilizing all the positive factors of the organs' youth to serve socialist construction as the guiding principles for future work.

    The meeting listened to the report made by Li Jian, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League's Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Committee to the Assembly, regarding "Mobilizing all the positive factors of the youth of the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs, doing a good job in the work of the organs, and serving socialist construction." The report pointed out that developing democracy is one of the effective methods to bring into play the youth's enthusiasm and creativity, invigorate the life of the League, and improve the efficiency of the work of the organs. In the future, the League organizations at all levels should consciously cultivate the democratic spirit of the youth. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate the League members to humbly learn from the older generation. The report made explanations on the issue of organizing the youth of the organs to advance towards science and culture. It proposed: In the process of advancing towards science and culture, the youth of the organs should not only study diligently and think independently; but also gradually cultivate a correct style of learning. They should be realistic and seek truth from facts, proceed in an orderly manner and step by step, and avoid being impetuous and rash; they should integrate theory with practice, achieve thorough understanding, and avoid swallowing things whole without seeking a deep understanding.

    The representatives present at the meeting, combined with the actual situation of the organs, enthusiastically discussed the issue of how to give play to the youth's enthusiasm and do a good job in the work of the organs. In group discussions and speeches at the assembly, the representatives sharply exposed and criticized the serious shortcomings in the work of the League in the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs and the bureaucratic work style of some leaders of the organs. Everyone believed that the phenomenon of unsound democratic life existed in the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs and League organizations in the past. League organizations at all levels have different degrees of detachment from reality and bureaucratic work style in their work; some League organizations do not pay enough attention to the urgent demands and immediate interests of the youth, and are too rigid in their attitude and impose too many restrictions when dealing with problems. The assembly believed that this phenomenon deserves serious attention, and the League Committee must overcome the shortcomings of not going deep into the work, being too rigid, lacking creativity, and thus lagging behind the masses in its future work.

    Yesterday, the assembly made a summary, elected new members of the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs League Committee and representatives to the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League. The assembly passed a resolution, calling on all League members and non-League youth in the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs to boldly expose the shortcomings and errors in the League and the work of the organs, oppose all kinds of bad phenomena, and resolutely fight against bureaucracy; calling on them to give play to the spirit of independent thinking, actively study their professional work, and persistently and tirelessly advance towards science and culture.

    During the meeting, Hu Yaobang, the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Zeng San, the Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the CPC, attended the meeting and gave instructions.

    青年团中共中央直属机关五次代表大会闭幕
    确定调动青年积极因素做好机关工作
    本报讯　青年团中共中央直属机关第五次代表大会8月21日到27日在北京举行。这次大会确定以充分发扬民主，组织青年顽强持久地向科学文化进军，调动机关青年的一切积极因素，为社会主义建设服务，作为今后的工作方针。
    会议听取了青年团中共中央直属机关委员会书记李鉴向大会所作的关于“调动中直机关青年的一切积极因素，做好机关工作，为社会主义建设服务”的报告。报告指出，发扬民主是发挥青年的积极性和创造性，活跃团的生活，提高机关工作效率的有效方法之一。今后各级团组织应该有意识地培养青年的民主精神。同时，也要教育团员虚心向老一辈学习。报告中对组织机关青年向科学文化进军的问题作了说明。提出：机关青年在向科学文化进军的过程中，既要刻苦钻研，独立思考；又要逐步培养正确的学风。应该实事求是，循序渐进，不要急躁冒进；应该联系实际，融会贯通，不要囫囵吞枣不求甚解。
    到会代表结合机关的实际情况，热烈地讨论了如何发挥青年的积极性，做好机关工作的问题。代表们在小组讨论和大会发言中，尖锐地揭发和批评了中直机关团的工作中的严重缺点和一些机关领导上的官僚主义作风。大家认为过去在中直机关和团组织中，民主生活不健全的现象是存在的。各级团组织在工作中不同程度地存在着脱离实际的官僚主义作风；有些团组织对青年的迫切要求和切身利益关心不够，在处理问题上态度生硬，限制太多。大会认为，这种现象值得引起严重注意，团委在今后工作中必须克服工作不深入、太刻板，缺乏创造性，以致领导落后于群众等缺点。
    昨天，大会进行了总结，选出了新的中直机关团委会委员和出席青年团第三次全国代表大会代表。大会通过决议，号召中直机关全体团员和非团青年大胆揭发团内和机关工作中的缺点和错误，反对各种不良现象，向官僚主义进行坚决的斗争；号召他们发挥独立思考的精神，积极钻研业务，顽强持久地向科学文化进军。
    会议期间，青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦同志和中共中央直属机关委员会副书记曾三同志到会作了指示。
