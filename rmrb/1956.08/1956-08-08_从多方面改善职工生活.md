    Improve Workers' Lives in Many Ways
    Caring for Oilfield Workers
    Xinhua News Agency: Starting in August, the Yumen Oil Mine will waive management fees for kindergartens and nurseries. The cost of furniture used by employees has been reduced by 60%, and the cost of medicine and hospitalization in the hospital has been reduced by 50%. In the past, the expenses of water, electricity, maintenance, and office supplies in the employee cafeteria that were borne by the employees will now be entirely borne by the enterprise. This is one of the measures taken by the Yumen Oil Mine to improve the welfare of its employees.
    The Yumen Oil Mine Party organization, administration, and trade union recently held meetings to formulate measures to improve the material and cultural life of employees. According to these measures, the area of employee dormitories to be newly built by the Yumen Oil Mine this year, using both state investment and self-construction with public assistance, will reach more than 100,790 square meters. In addition, a batch of canteens with a construction area of ​​more than 16,800 square meters are also under construction. The problem of all female employees in the mine having access to infant and childcare services this year will also be completely resolved.
    The Yumen Oil Mine has decided to allocate more than 100,380 yuan to subsidize employees who have financial difficulties due to illness or other reasons. The Oil Mine Trade Union will allocate 60,000 yuan this year to expand the employee sanatorium in Jiuquan. All units in the mine will also establish employee spare-time sanatoriums and nutritional canteens.
    The mine will also build a cinema this year, establish five to six mobile film projection teams, and expand or add sports venues to improve the cultural and sports life of employees.
    Organize Employee Welfare Visiting Group
    Xinhua News Agency: The "Kunming Municipal Employee Welfare Visiting Group," composed of Kunming Mayor Pan Shuoduan, Deputy Mayor Zeng Shuhuai, and responsible cadres from more than a dozen units including the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Commerce Bureau, visited various factories and enterprises in Kunming in eight groups on August 2nd.
    When the visiting group led by Zeng Shuhuai visited the joint state-private Kunming Mingde Weaving Factory, several female workers on the night shift were eating. They told Zeng Shuhuai that because the supply of lard and pork was very limited, the health of many night-shift workers was affected. The Hui ethnic cook, who believes in Islam, said that they had not been able to eat butter for a long time because the food company did not allocate it. 75% of the workers in this weaving factory are female, most of whom were merged from other weaving factories when the joint state-private ownership was implemented this spring. These female workers have not yet enjoyed the 56-day maternity leave. After understanding these situations, Zeng Shuhuai expressed that he would urge relevant agencies to resolve them quickly.
    Visiting Old Anyuan Workers
    This newspaper reports that recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions entrusted the local governments and trade unions of Jiangxi and Hunan to visit 495 old Anyuan worker households, provide relief to 187 households with financial difficulties, and determine long-term relief for households with special difficulties so that they can spend a happy old age.
    During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Anyuan coal miners persisted in the revolutionary struggle for a long time. Later, capitalists and reactionary governments persecuted activists, forcing them to wander around. After liberation, some of them returned to various jobs and persisted in their work, but some were old, widowed, and had financial difficulties. After this relief, their lives will be guaranteed.

    Improve Labor Conditions on Construction Sites
    Xinhua News Agency: In a recent safety and hygiene inspection, 64 basic construction sites in Shenyang City improved workers' labor conditions in more than 1,300 items. The No. 503 construction site of the Second Engineering Company of the Sixth Metallurgical and Chemical Construction Corporation built a work shed in the carpentry workshop, which solved the problem of narrow space. The site was cleaned by designated personnel, reducing the number of nail puncture accidents, and protective devices were installed on the machinery. Unsafe wires were replaced with insulated wires. The construction sites of the Shenyang Third Construction Engineering Company solved 170 problems such as leakage, mixed wires, and poor insulation of electromechanical equipment that affected safety, added 23 transformers to reduce the voltage of the wires to prevent electric shock, and added 11 work sheds and 1,600 square meters of safety nets to ensure the safety of high-altitude operations. The construction site of the Third Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company revised 29 operating procedures and 11 safety systems. Many construction sites also built drainage ditches and sewers, implemented regular disinfection and cleaning systems, and installed fly and mosquito prevention and extermination equipment in canteens, kitchens, and dormitories to ensure that employees eat well and rest well.
    Expensive Medicines are Fully Borne by Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency: All expenses for employees in Tianjin to purchase expensive medicines for treatment will be fully borne by each enterprise from August 1. In the past, the expenses for expensive medicines required by employees who were sick and the expenses for expensive medicines required by the immediate family members supported by the employees were entirely borne by the employees themselves. In order to reduce the financial burden on employees, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions requested and was approved by the Municipal People's Committee to change the system so that the expenses for expensive medicines required for employees' treatment are fully borne by each enterprise; half of the expenses for expensive medicines required for the treatment of immediate family members supported by the employees are borne by each enterprise. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions is also investigating the debts owed by employees in the past due to medical treatment, and is preparing to study subsidy methods based on specific circumstances.
    Allocating Funds to Help Employees Repay Debts
    Xinhua News Agency: The administrative and trade union organizations of state-owned factories, mines, and commercial systems in Fushun have allocated more than 300,000 yuan from the surplus bonuses, medical expenses, and welfare funds from previous years to help employees who have been in debt for a long time repay their debts.
    The debts to be repaid this time include medical expenses and hospital deposits owed due to medical treatment, debts owed due to financial difficulties caused by illness, debts owed due to the heavy burden of having many children, or debts owed due to sudden accidents such as death. By the end of July, various units in the city had repaid more than 100,000 yuan of debts for indebted employees.
