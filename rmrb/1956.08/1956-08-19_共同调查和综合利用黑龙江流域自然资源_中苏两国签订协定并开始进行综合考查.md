Xinhua News Agency, August 18th. An agreement for the joint investigation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the Heilongjiang River Basin by China and the Soviet Union was signed in Beijing this afternoon.

According to this agreement, China and the Soviet Union will jointly investigate and study the natural resources and the prospects for the development of productivity in the Heilongjiang River Basin bordering the two countries, and will conduct surveying and design work for the preparation of a comprehensive utilization plan for the Ergun River and the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River.

Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhu Kezhen, signed on behalf of the Chinese side.

Deputy Representative of the General Bureau of Economic Liaison of the Soviet Union in China, N.A. Krylov, signed on behalf of the Soviet side.

Zhu Kezhen and Krylov spoke at the signing ceremony.

Representatives and experts from relevant departments of China and the Soviet Union also attended the signing ceremony.

Xinhua News Agency, August 18th. A comprehensive survey team of more than 100 people, composed of Chinese experts in water conservancy, geology, forestry, soil science, power, transportation, and other fields, has begun a comprehensive survey in the Heilongjiang River Basin on the border between China and the Soviet Union, together with Soviet scientists.

The survey team members began departing from Beijing in batches in early July. For more than a month, the forestry and soil experts of the survey team have preliminarily completed the survey of natural conditions such as soil, plants, and soil geochemistry in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River; geological experts have observed and studied the profiles along the river and the metamorphic rock conditions; transportation experts have surveyed some of the waterways. The survey team will further formulate a four-year work plan for 1957 and beyond based on the results of the preliminary survey.

The Chinese experts participating in the comprehensive survey are led by Vice Minister of Water Conservancy, Feng Zhongyun. These experts are organized into five groups: natural conditions, hydropower, surveying and design, transportation, and geology.
