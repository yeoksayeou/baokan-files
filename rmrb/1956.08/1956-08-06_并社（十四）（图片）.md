	Merged Cooperative (14)
	Adapted by Tu Honghen, Drawn by Jiang Ying
	(Adapted from Xu Guangyao's original work "Shuming and Yinghua")
	53　Just as he was looking for Yinghua, Yinghua arrived. She had rushed back to get her small coat, not wanting to be late. Li Baichuan slammed the letter down and roared, "Eating the family's food, and you're having secret relations with foreigners! Bah!" Yinghua was frightened into a cold sweat, and her mother's face turned pale with fear.
	54　Yinghua thought, "I haven't broken the law," so she became bolder. She said that communicating with Shuming was her right to freedom, and no one could interfere. And she pointed out that Qiao Tianrui was sabotaging the advanced cooperative and told them not to be fooled by him.
	55　Li Baichuan was shocked to encounter his own daughter arguing with him for the first time. He pointed to the door and told Yinghua to "get out!" Tears welled up in Yinghua's eyes. She was stunned for a moment, then tossed her head, and started to walk away, her mother crying as she rushed to pull her back.
	56　Suddenly, someone burst in, crying and saying that the public security personnel had tied up his father, saying it was connected to a case in Harbin. Looking closely, this person turned out to be Qiao Tianrui's son. Li Baichuan's eyes went blank upon hearing this, and it took him a while to catch his breath.

    并社（十四）
    屠鸿痕改编·　江荧画
    （据徐光耀原作“树明和莺花”改编）
    53　正找莺花，莺花来了。她是急急回来拿小大氅的，不想来晚了。李百川“刷”的把信一摔，吼道：“吃着家里的饭，你私通外国！呸！”莺花吓得出了一身冷汗，她妈吓得脸色苍白。
    54　莺花一想：“我没有犯法”，胆子便大了些。她说跟树明通信，是自己的自由权利，谁也不能干涉。并且指出乔天瑞破坏高级社，叫别上他的当。
    55　李百川第一次碰见自己的亲生闺女跟自己抗争，惊住了，竟指着门外，叫莺花“滚出去！”莺花泪水涌上眼圈，楞了楞，把头一摔，迈步就走，她妈哭着赶过来拉她。
    56　忽然跳进个人来，带哭说，公安人员把他的爹上了绑了，说是跟哈尔滨一个什么案子有联系。一看这人原来是乔天瑞的儿子。李百川一听，两眼发直，好一阵才呼了一口气。
