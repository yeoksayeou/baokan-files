Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 12th: The United Front Work Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited leaders of the Guangzhou local organizations of various democratic parties, including Xu Chongqing, Guo Qiaoran, Chen Yilin, Huang Changshui, and Lin Yiyuan, to hold symposiums on August 4th and 10th to solicit their opinions on the United Front work.

The representatives of the democratic parties unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" proposed by the Communist Party of China. At the same time, they raised sharp criticisms of many shortcomings in the United Front work in Guangzhou. They believed that the United Front Department of Guangzhou and relevant agencies had not properly implemented the United Front policy of the Communist Party of China. Many cadres in government agencies looked down on members of democratic parties, distrusted cadres from democratic parties, and increased the difficulty of the democratic parties' work. They also pointed out that some democratic party members held the same leadership positions as Communist Party members in government agencies, but did not see telegrams and documents related to their work sent from higher-level administrative leadership agencies. Some Communist Party members in some government agencies did not directly consult with the non-Communist Party leaders in charge of the matter or reported situations beyond their level, making it difficult for those leaders to work and preventing the full implementation of the "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" policy. Some major issues in some government agencies were decided at meetings of Communist Party organizations and were no longer discussed at administrative meetings, making it impossible for non-Communist Party leaders at the same level to understand and grasp the issues. All of these directly weakened the enthusiasm of democratic party members and affected the work.

The heads of the Guangzhou local organizations of various democratic parties participating in the symposium also believed that the United Front Work Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China "only manages the top but not the bottom," and its work was not comprehensive or in-depth, and did not provide enough care and assistance for the work, ideology, and living conditions of democratic party members. They suggested to the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Committee that they hoped to invite the heads of various democratic parties to discuss and study together when determining important policies and guidelines and the city's central work in the future.

The United Front Work Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China stated that it would carefully consider everyone's criticisms and suggestions to improve the United Front work in Guangzhou.

    广州市各民主党派举行座谈会
    提出贯彻统一战线政策的积极建议
    新华社广州12日电　中共广州市委员会统一战线工作部于八月四日和十日，先后两次邀请各民主党派广州地方组织负责人许崇清、郭翘然、陈伊林、黄长水、林一元等人举行座谈会，征求他们对统一战线工作的意见。
    各民主党派人士首先对中国共产党所提出的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针一致表示衷心拥护，同时对广州市统一战线工作中的很多缺点提出了尖锐的批评。他们认为，广州市统战部门和各有关机关没有很好贯彻执行中国共产党的统一战线政策，有不少机关干部轻视民主党派成员，不信任民主党派的干部，增加了民主党派工作的困难。他们还指出，有些民主党派人士在机关中担任和共产党员相同的领导职务，但看不到上级行政领导机关发来同业务有关的电报、文件；有些机关的一些共产党员不直接向主管的非共产党员的领导人员商量问题，或越级反映情况，使那些领导人员很难工作，也使“长期共存、互相监督”的方针不能全面贯彻执行。有些机关的一些重大问题，在共产党组织的会议上作出决定以后，就不再在行政会议上讨论，使非共产党员的同级领导人无从了解和掌握，这些都直接削弱了民主党派成员的积极性，也影响了工作。
    参加座谈会的各民主党派广州地方组织负责人还认为，中共广州市委统一战线工作部“只统上不统下”，工作不全面，不深入，对民主党派成员的工作、思想、生活状况关心和帮助不够。他们向中共广州市委和市委统一战线工作部建议，希望今后在确定重要的政策方针和市的中心工作时，要邀请各民主党派负责人共同来商量和研究。
    中共广州市委统一战线工作部表示，要很好地考虑大家的批评和建议，以改进广州市的统一战线工作。
