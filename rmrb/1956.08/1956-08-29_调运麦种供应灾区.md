    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 26th. Hebei Province is transferring a large quantity of high-quality wheat seeds from within and outside the province to supply farmers in disaster areas.
    In order to expand the wheat planting area, self-retained wheat seeds of agricultural cooperatives in most parts of the province are insufficient. In some areas, wheat quality has been reduced due to rain and water damage, making it unsuitable for seed retention. Now, local grain departments are cooperating with agricultural departments to conduct identification work on wheat seeds in national grain depots in order to select a large number of high-quality wheat seeds to supply farmers. According to statistics from the grain departments of seven special zones including Handan, Xingtai, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Tongxian, and Cangxian, more than 80 million catties of wheat seeds have been identified by the 20th. Shaanxi, Shandong, Beijing, Tianjin and other provinces and cities will support Hebei Province with 185 million catties of high-quality wheat seeds. 35 million catties of the 65 million catties of "Bima No. 1" wheat seeds supported by Shaanxi Province have now been transported.
    Disaster areas that cannot drain water and plant wheat this year will drain water and sow early-maturing crops in a timely manner next spring. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau instructed local grain departments to preserve the existing stocks of early-maturing crop seeds and supply them to farmers in a timely manner next spring. The Provincial Grain Bureau and the Provincial Department of Agriculture also sent cadres to Heilongjiang, Liaoning and other provinces to purchase early-maturing crop potato seeds.

    调运麦种供应灾区
    新华社保定26日电　河北省正从省内外调运大批优良麦种供应灾区农民。
    为了扩大小麦种植面积，全省大部地区的农业社自留麦种不够。有些地区因雨水浸害，小麦质量降低，不宜留种。现在各地粮食部门正和农业部门配合起来，对国家粮库中的麦种进行鉴定工作，以便选出大批优良麦种供应农民。据邯郸、邢台、保定、石家庄、天津、通县、沧县七个专区的粮食部门统计，到20日为止已经鉴定的麦种有八千多万斤。陕西、山东、北京、天津等省、市将支援河北省一亿八千五百万斤优良麦种。陕西省支援的六千五百万斤碧蚂一号麦种，现在已经运到三千五百万斤。
    今年不能排水种麦的灾区，明年春天将及时排水播种早熟作物。因此，河北省粮食厅指示各地粮食部门把现有库存的早熟作物种子保存起来，到明年春天及时供应农民。省粮食厅、农业厅还派干部到黑龙江、辽宁等省去采购早熟作物马铃薯种。
