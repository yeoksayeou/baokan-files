Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th. The person in charge of the Heilongjiang Provincial Flood Control Headquarters told Xinhua reporters on the 13th: The people of Heilongjiang Province are currently engaged in an arduous struggle against the largest flood threat in history. Currently, the water levels of the province's main rivers, including the Heilongjiang River, Songhua River, Mudanjiang River, and Lalin River, have successively exceeded the guaranteed water level and the highest water level on record. The water levels of the Nenjiang River and Hulan River are also quite high. The lives and property of the people and farmland in more than thirty cities and counties along the rivers are under great threat from flooding.

The formation of this flood is due to excessive rainfall since the beginning of summer, rapid rainfall, wide area, long duration, and short intervals. In addition, the initial assessment of the severity of the water situation by the leadership was insufficient, some cadres had a paralyzing mentality, insufficient attention was paid to the quality of the dams, and the development of the water situation was not accurately grasped, resulting in considerable damage from the flood. To date, according to reports from various places, more than 460 villages have been affected by river water overflowing, breaching dikes, mountain floods, and waterlogging, affecting more than 200,000 residents and nearly 500,000 hectares of farmland. When these disasters occurred, the provincial leaders and local leading organs vigorously organized rescue work, quickly rescuing most of the affected residents from the threat of flooding. Currently, more than 160,000 affected residents have been resettled in nearby towns and villages. The provincial and disaster-stricken party and government leading organs have also sent a large number of cadres with a large amount of cash, grain, clothing, etc., to provide relief to the affected residents, and sent condolence teams and medical teams to express condolences and carry out disease prevention and treatment work.

Currently, more than 18,000 cadres across the province are leading more than 400,000 people to participate in dike protection and dam repair. Because they have been fighting the flood day and night, reinforcing dikes, and rescuing dangerous spots, the loss of life and property of the people in the riverine areas has been greatly reduced.

In the struggle against this flood, the central government has provided strong guidance and support. The Central Flood Control Headquarters has allocated a large amount of flood control materials from Liaoning and Jilin provinces. The troops dispatched by the Chinese People's Liberation Army to support Harbin's flood control struggle have played a decisive role in dike protection and rescue. People in non-riverine areas of the province are also actively supporting the flood control struggle in riverine areas.

The person in charge finally emphasized that the development of the water situation in Heilongjiang Province is serious. The current water situation of various rivers is quite critical, and the dikes have been immersed in high water levels for more than half a month. Some dikes were not of good quality to begin with, and have successively experienced leakage, collapse, and breaching. With the increase in rainfall and the development of the water situation in the future, these dangerous situations will become more serious. Therefore, all levels of leading organs and the people of the province must fully recognize the serious situation of the current flood threat, maintain a clear mind, and on the one hand, continue to fight the flood with more firm confidence and strength without the slightest slack; on the other hand, they must estimate the worst possible situation in case of emergency. Areas along the river that are difficult to defend and may be flooded should organize the elderly and children to transfer to safe areas in advance to reduce the loss of life and property.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee jointly issued a letter to the people of the province on August 13, calling on workers, peasants, officers and soldiers of the garrison, people from all walks of life, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and state organ staff to urgently mobilize and fight to overcome the flood.

### 各河水情危急，三十多个市县受严重威胁  黑龙江省人民正同洪水作艰巨斗争

    各河水情危急，三十多个市县受严重威胁
    黑龙江省人民正同洪水作艰巨斗争
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省防汛指挥部负责人十三日对新华社记者说：黑龙江省人民目前正和历史上最大的洪水威胁进行艰巨的斗争。现在，全省主要江河黑龙江、松花江、牡丹江、拉林河等水位，都已先后超过了保证水位和历史上有记载以来的最高水位，嫩江、呼兰河的水位也相当高，沿江地区的三十多个市、县的人民生命财产和农田受到洪水侵袭的极大威胁。
    这次洪水的形成是由于入夏以来雨量过大，降雨急速，面广，连续时间长，间隔时间短。加之领导上初期对水情的严重性估计不足，某些干部存在着麻痹思想，对堤坝的质量注意不够，以及对水情的发展情况掌握不准，洪水造成了相当严重的损害。到目前止，据各地报告已有四百六十多个村庄因河水漫堤、决堤、山洪冲击和内涝成灾，受灾居民达二十万人以上，受灾农田近五十万公顷。在这些灾害发生时，省领导和当地领导机关，都大力组织了抢救工作，很快地把大部分受灾居民从受洪水威胁下抢救出来，目前已有十六万多名受灾居民被安置到附近的城镇和乡村。省和灾区党政领导机关，还派出大批干部携带大量现款、粮食、衣物等前去救济受灾居民，并派出慰问队和医疗队进行慰问和进行疾病预防、治疗工作。
    现在，全省有一万八千多名干部领导着四十多万人参加护堤修坝。由于他们日夜奋勇地同洪水作斗争，加固了堤坝，抢救了险口，大大减少了沿江地区人民生命和财产的损失。
    在和这次的洪水斗争中，中央给予了有力的指导和支援。中央防汛指挥部已从辽宁、吉林两省调拨来大量防汛物资。中国人民解放军调来支援哈尔滨市防汛斗争的部队，在护堤抢险中发挥了决定性的作用。省内非沿江地区的人民也踊跃支援沿江地区的防汛斗争。
    这位负责人最后强调地指出，目前黑龙江省水情发展是严重的。而目前各河流水情已经相当危急，堤坝在高水位浸润时间已达半月以上，有些堤坝原来质量就不够好，已相继发生漏水、坍塌、溃决等险象，随着今后雨量增加，水势的发展，这些危险情况将会更加严重。因此，要求全省各级领导机关和人民，必须充分认识到目前洪水威胁的严重形势，保持清醒头脑，一方面继续以更加坚定的信心和力量，同洪水进行丝毫不懈的斗争；另方面要估计到可能发生的最坏情况，以防万一，沿江某些不易防守可能遭洪水淹没的地区，应事先组织老幼转移到安全地带，以减少生命财产的损失。
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　中国共产党黑龙江省委员会和黑龙江省人民委员会在八月十三日联合发表告全省人民书，号召全省工人、农民、驻军指战员、各界人民群众和共产党员、青年团员、国家机关工作人员紧急动员起来，为战胜洪水而斗争。
