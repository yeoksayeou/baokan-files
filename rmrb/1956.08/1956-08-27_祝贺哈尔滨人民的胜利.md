Congratulating the People of Harbin on Their Victory
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The flood prevention struggle in Harbin, a city of great concern to the people of the entire nation, has achieved final victory.

Harbin is a new major industrial city in our country and a hub for water and land transportation in the Songhua River basin. Its victory in this flood prevention struggle is of great significance for ensuring the smooth progress of the country's socialist economic construction and protecting the lives and property of the 1.4 million people of Harbin.

Twenty-four years ago, in 1932, Harbin was flooded under enemy and puppet rule. The floodwaters of the Songhua River poured into the urban area of Harbin, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the city's people. At that time, many of Harbin's main roads were submerged, and residents had to travel by boat. Since liberation, the Songhua River has flooded twice, but both the flood of 1953 and this year's flood have been overcome by the people of Harbin. This year's flood was unprecedented in its intensity and water level. On August 15th and 16th, the water level of the Songhua River reached 120.06 meters, 34 centimeters higher than the highest water level in 1932. Despite the ferocity of the flood, the city of Harbin on the banks of the Songhua River stood firm and safe. This fact once again illustrates a well-known truth: many things that were impossible in history can be achieved step by step in an era when the people are masters of their own destiny.

In the struggle to overcome the flood, the people of Harbin demonstrated a high degree of socialist consciousness, organization, and discipline. During the most tense half-month of August, Harbin had a flood control army of 100,000 people, working day and night to reinforce the dikes. Many residents and workers voluntarily sacrificed their rest time to go to the riverbanks to participate in voluntary labor. "Everything for overcoming the flood!" "Make contributions to the motherland and to socialism in the flood prevention struggle!" - these were the battle slogans of the people of Harbin. On the long sixty-li dike, wherever danger appeared, there were "human dikes" blocking the waves until earth and stones could be brought to plug the breaches. The people of Harbin raced against the flood and against time in this way, working day and night, raising the dikes as the water rose, and finally defeating the unprecedentedly fierce flood.

The flood in the Songhua River struck suddenly. In early August, when the river water began to rise, the Harbin municipal party and government leading organs made predictions and analyses of the rainfall and water conditions in the Songhua River basin, and determined that the coming flood would exceed the height of the existing dikes. Therefore, they listed flood prevention work as the central task of the city, mobilized a huge workforce, and raised the original sixty-li long river dikes by half a meter within five days. The Harbin municipal leading organs constantly educated flood control personnel to overcome the mentality of luck and complacency, and formed a flood control army of 100,000 people to continue to widen and strengthen the river dikes, and rushed to build two secondary dikes with a total length of 6,500 meters in a very short time. These timely and correct measures by the leading organs were an important guarantee for overcoming this flood.

During the emergency period of flood prevention in Harbin, a large amount of flood control materials and transportation tools were continuously transported to Harbin from Beijing, Shanghai, and various parts of Heilongjiang Province. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Harbin and the surrounding areas actively participated in the flood prevention struggle in Harbin and became the vanguard of the city's flood control army. The arduous and outstanding efforts of all the people of Harbin, coupled with the support of all regions and aspects of the country, enabled the struggle of Harbin to overcome the flood to achieve great victory.

In addition to Harbin, the people of many other provinces and cities have also waged equally resolute and heroic struggles against the floods, and have also achieved significant victories in the struggles. The victory of the people of Harbin is just a prominent example of the countless victorious struggles throughout the country.

Now the flood threat to Harbin has been lifted. At 3:00 PM on the 26th, the water level on the river surface in Harbin has dropped below the warning level. However, the rainy season in Northeast China has not yet ended, and the water level of the Songhua River may still rise. Therefore, Harbin and other cities in the Songhua River basin should continue to strengthen flood prevention work. Moreover, after the flood threat is lifted, there is still a lot of disaster relief and post-disaster work that requires continued efforts. We believe that Harbin and the various cities downstream of the Songhua River will certainly be able to continue to strive for the victory of production and disaster relief after the victory of the flood prevention struggle.

    祝贺哈尔滨人民的胜利
    本报评论员
    全国人民密切关怀的哈尔滨市的防洪斗争，已经取得了最后的胜利。
    哈尔滨市是我国新兴的大工业城市，是松花江流域的水陆交通枢纽。它在这次防洪斗争中取得的胜利，对于保障国家社会主义经济建设的顺利进行，保障哈尔滨市一百四十万人民的生命财产的安全，都有极为巨大的意义。
    二十四年前的1932年，在敌伪统治下的哈尔滨市被水淹过一次。松花江的大水冲进了哈尔滨的市区，全市人民的生命财产受到惨重的损失。当时哈尔滨许多主要马路上一片汪洋，居民出门必须借助舟楫。解放以后，松花江发过两次洪水，不管是1953年的洪水和今年的洪水，都被哈尔滨市人民战胜了。今年的洪水来势之猛，水位之高，都是空前的。8月15、16两日，松花江的水位曾经达到一二○点○六公尺，比1932年的最高水位还高三十四公分。水势虽然这样凶猛，松花江边的哈尔滨市却是巍然屹立，安全无恙。这个事实又一次说明了一个人所共知的道理：历史上许许多多作不到的事情，在人民当家做主的时代，总会一步一步地作到的。
    在战胜洪水的斗争中，哈尔滨市人民表现了高度的社会主义觉悟、组织性和纪律性。在最紧张的8月份的半个月中，哈尔滨市有十万人的防汛大军，夜以继日地抢修堤防。许多居民和职工自动牺牲休息时间，赶往江堤参加义务劳动。“一切为了战胜洪水！”“在防洪斗争中为祖国、为社会主义立功！”——这就是哈尔滨市人民的战斗口号。在漫长的六十里大堤上，哪里出现了险情，哪里就有“人堤”挡住大浪，直到运来土石，堵住漏洞为止。哈尔滨市人民就是这样地和洪水、和时间赛跑，日夜工作，水涨堤高，到底把空前凶猛的洪水战胜了。
    松花江这场洪水是突然袭来的。八月上旬，当着江水开始上涨的时候，哈尔滨市党政领导机关对于松花江流域的雨情、水情作了预测和分析，断定即将袭来的洪水会超过原有堤防的高度，于是把防洪工作列为全市的中心任务，动员了巨大的人力，在五天以内把原有六十里长的沿江大堤加高了半公尺。哈尔滨市领导机关不断地教育防汛人员，克服侥幸心理和麻痹情绪，并且组成十万人的防汛大军，继续把沿江大堤加宽加固，在极短的时间以内，抢修了两条长达六千五百公尺的二道堤防。领导机关的这些及时、正确的措施，是战胜这次洪水的重要保证。
    在哈尔滨防洪的紧急时期，大量的防汛器材和运输工具，从北京、上海和黑龙江省各地源源运到哈尔滨市。驻在哈尔滨市和外围地区的人民解放军部队，积极地参加哈尔滨市的防洪斗争，并且成为全市防洪大军的先锋。哈尔滨市全体人民艰苦卓绝的努力，加上全国各个地区和各个方面的支援，就使得哈尔滨市战胜洪水的斗争取得极大的胜利。
    除了哈尔滨市以外，还有许多省区和城市的人民，对洪水作了同样坚决、英勇的斗争，在斗争中同样取得重大的胜利。哈尔滨市人民的胜利，只是全国各地无数胜利斗争中的一个突出的例子。
    现在哈尔滨市已经解除洪水威胁，二十六日下午三时，哈尔滨市江面水位已降至警戒水位以下。但是，东北地区的雨季还没有结束，松花江水位还可能上涨，因此，哈尔滨市和松花江流域其他城市还应继续加强防汛工作。而且在洪水威胁解除以后，还有很多救灾善后工作，需要继续努力。我们相信，哈尔滨市和松花江下游的各个城市，一定能在防汛斗争胜利以后，继续争取生产救灾的胜利。
