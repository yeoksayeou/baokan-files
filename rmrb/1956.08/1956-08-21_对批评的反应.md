    Column: Responses to Criticism

    Letter from the Beijing Secondary School Enrollment Committee Office: The criticism you raised in your newspaper article "Why So Cold to People?" on August 3rd is correct.
    In past years, the Beijing Secondary School Enrollment Committee had always tried to arrange accommodation for out-of-town candidates who could not solve their accommodation problems during the examination period, but every year there were always a few unsuccessful students who insisted on not leaving. Therefore, at a symposium of secondary vocational schools convened by the Enrollment Committee Office this year, some schools proposed no longer receiving out-of-town candidates. At that time, the office only one-sidedly considered avoiding "trouble" without considering that doing so would cause more serious consequences. Without formal discussion by the Enrollment Committee or requesting instructions from the Director of the Education Bureau, it rashly made the decision that "out-of-town candidates will generally not be received," thus committing the bureaucratic error of being seriously irresponsible towards the difficulties of out-of-town candidates.
    We fully accept the criticism from your newspaper. The person in charge of our office has made a self-criticism and has educated the relevant staff. We will definitely learn from this lesson and earnestly change our work style.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    北京中等学校招生委员会办公室来信：八月三日你报“为什么对人这么冷淡”一文，对我们提出的批评是正确的。
    过去历年北京市中等学校招生委员会，在考试期间，对不能解决住宿问题的外地考生都曾设法安置，但每年总有少数没有考取的学生坚持不走。因此，今年在招生委员会办公室召集的一次中等专业学校座谈会上，便有些学校提出不再接待外地考生。当时办公室只片面考虑到避免“麻烦”，而没有考虑到这样做会造成更严重的后果。未经招生委员会正式讨论，也未请示教育局局长，便轻率地作出“外地考生一般不予接待”的决定，因此犯了对外地考生的困难，严重不负责任的官僚主义的错误。
    我们完全接受你报的批评，我室负责人已作了检讨，并向有关工作人员进行了教育。我们一定引为教训，切实改变工作作风。
