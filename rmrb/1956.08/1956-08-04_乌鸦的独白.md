    The Raven's Soliloquy
    Clark

    I am a raven, please allow me to express a little of the raven's "one family opinion."

    A few days ago, I heard this news: In "Fishing and Killing the Family," a passage sung by Xiao En upon his appearance has been modified.

    "Rising early, I open the brushwood door, the raven has crowed;
    Flying past, calling back, what is the reason?"

    It is said that this contains "superstition" and has been modified to:

    "Rising early, I open the brushwood door, the sun red as fire;
    Flocks of little birds fly out of their nests."

    Whether the modification is good or bad is beyond our raven's understanding. However, if to eliminate "superstition" means to obliterate us ravens, then your most precious piece of literary heritage, the "Book of Songs," with its "The blackbird alights, on whose roof does it perch?" would have to be embellished as "The phoenix sings, on the eastern peak it dwells!"

    When we ravens fly to the rooftop and crow, Chinese friends consider it inauspicious, which is not entirely out of "superstition." To put it more attractively, there is some scientific basis to it.

    We ravens like to eat carrion, and our sense of smell is particularly sharp.

    When your critically ill people are nearing death, parts of their bodies have already lost their vitality; we ravens, with our sharp senses, smell the odor first, so we fly to the rooftop and crow, expressing joy, for there will be meat to eat again. As a result, your patient indeed "kicks the bucket."

    This is the basis for why Chinese friends see us as inauspicious birds.

    Indian friends seem to have a more friendly view of us. They regard ravens as "messengers of the gods." However, this view is probably based on the same grounds. From a supernatural standpoint, when people die, the gods send messengers to summon their souls.

    In short, ravens are disliked, becoming a national sentiment in China, with a tradition of over three thousand years. This is an undeniable fact. However, despite your dislike of us, thank you for not wanting to exterminate us. There is probably some scientific basis for this as well.

    Seriously, we ravens are not such utterly evil and harmful birds. We do partially harm your crops, but we especially like to eat carrion. This allows our kind to unconsciously play the role of scavengers.

    Imagine, if many rats die, we come to clear them away. Then, wouldn't this be helpful in preventing the plague? Please have your doctors judge.

    Furthermore, forests are your valuable property. We ravens live in the forests, helping to eliminate pests, and also generously donate bird droppings. You should know that our bird droppings are the most nutritious.

    These are probably the main reasons why we, this group of "messengers of the gods," have not only been able to coexist peacefully with Indian friends for thousands of years but also with Chinese friends.

    Seriously, we ravens also do not appreciate our own calls. But what can we do? We are not parrots!

    Oh right, I also remembered that your poet saint Du Fu has such a poem, titled "Lament for the Royal Grandson." The beginning also has these two lines:

    "On Chang'an city walls, white-headed crows,
    Fly at night, calling above Yanqiu Gate."

    You certainly know that white-headed crows are also our kind, only they wear a white or gray scarf around their heads.

    I am a little worried that your new Chinese literati who like to eliminate "superstition" will again obliterate our kind, modifying the poet saint's lines to: "On Chang'an city walls, stars like pearls, little birds chirp in their nests"?

    Forgive my boldness, you didn't expect a raven to come and grumble. A capital offense, a capital offense.

    乌鸦的独白
    克拉克
    我是乌鸦，请允许我发表一点乌鸦的“一家之鸣”。
    前几天听到这样一个消息：“打鱼杀家”里面，萧恩出场唱的一段唱辞被修改了。
    “清早起，开柴扉，乌鸦叫过；
    飞过去，叫过来，却是为何？”
    据说这里面包含有“迷信”，被修改成为：
    “清早起，开柴扉，日红如火；
    一群群，小鸟儿，飞出巢窝。
    修改得好坏，我们乌鸦是门外汉，不懂。但是，如果为了扫除“迷信”就要把我们乌鸦抹杀掉，那末你们最宝贵的一部文学遗产“诗经”上的“瞻乌爰止，于谁之屋”，就得被润色为“凤凰鸣矣，于彼东岳”了。
    我们乌鸦飞到屋顶上去叫，被中国朋友认为不祥，这倒并不是出于“迷信”。说得引人动听一点，这倒是有科学根据的。
    我们乌鸦喜欢吃腐肉，我们的嗅觉来得特别锐敏。
    当你们病重的人临危的时候，身上的部分组织已经先失去了生机；锐敏的我们乌鸦先闻到气味，故飞到屋顶上去叫，表示高兴，又有肉吃了。结果呢，你们的病人果然就“一命呜呼”了。
    你们中国朋友把我们看成不祥之鸟，根据就在这里。
    印度朋友对于我们的看法似乎要友好一些。他们把乌鸦当成“神的使者”。不过，这种看法恐怕也是出于同一根据的吧。从超现实的立场来看，你们人的去世是神派遣使者先来把他的灵魂召唤去了。
    总之，乌鸦遭人厌，在中国成了民族感情，已经有三千多年的传统了。这是不可否认的事实。不过，你们尽管讨厌我们，但要谢谢你们并不想消灭我们。在这里恐怕也是有一些科学根据的吧。
    认真地说，我们乌鸦倒并不是那么十恶不善的害鸟。我们也部分地伤害你们的农作物，但尤其喜欢吃腐肉。这就使得我们的同类们不自觉地发挥着清道夫的作用。
    请设想，老鼠死了不少，有我们来把它们清除。那末，这在鼠疫的预防上岂不是会有帮助的吗？请你们的大夫们判断一下吧。
    再者，森林是你们的宝贵财产。我们乌鸦栖息在森林里面在帮助消除害虫，而且还慷慨地捐献鸟粪。你们应该知道，我们的鸟粪是最富于营养的啦。
    这些恐怕就是主要原因，说明我们这群“神的使者”几千年来不仅和印度朋友能够和平共处，而且和中国朋友也能够和平共处。
    再认真地说，我们乌鸦也并不欣赏我们自己的叫声。不过有什么办法呢？我们并不是鹦鹉啊！
    对了，我还想起了你们的诗圣杜甫有这么一首诗，题名“哀王孙”。开头也有这样的两句：
    “长安城头头白乌，
    夜飞延秋门上呼。”
    你们当然知道，白头乌也是我们的族类，只是在头上围了一条白色或灰色的围巾。
    我有点耽心，你们喜欢扫除“迷信”的中国新文豪们，该不会又要抹杀掉我们的族类，把诗圣的诗句修改为：“长安城头星似珠，小鸟在巢啾啾呼”吧？
    冒昧得很，你们没有想出，乌鸦也要来发牢骚。死罪，死罪。
