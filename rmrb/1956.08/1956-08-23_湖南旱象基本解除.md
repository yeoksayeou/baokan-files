Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, August 21st. From the 19th until 8:00 AM today, most areas of Hunan Province, except for a few areas in southern Hunan, have experienced widespread heavy rainfall.

According to the Hunan Provincial Meteorological Bureau, rainfall in the Dongting Lake basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Xiang River, the main double-cropping late rice producing areas, reached 30 mm to 89.6 mm. In Yuanling and Anhua, hilly and mountainous areas in the northwest and famous for tea production, rainfall reached 53 to 62.5 mm. Rainfall was lighter in the upper reaches of the Xiang River and Zi River in the southwest.

This rainfall has largely eliminated the threat of drought in many areas. Farmers in the hilly and mountainous areas that were previously affected by drought are now starting to harvest intermediate rice while also rushing to plant autumn crops.
