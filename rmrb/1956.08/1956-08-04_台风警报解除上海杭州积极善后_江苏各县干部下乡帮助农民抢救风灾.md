Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: Shanghai lifted the typhoon alert today, and all units are dealing with the aftermath.

Today and yesterday, more than 600 electrical workers rushed to repair over 3,000 power poles and wires that were blown down or broken by the wind. By tonight, factories that had experienced power outages had all resumed power supply; most of the extinguished street lights were also relit. Most of the seventeen ferry lines across the Huangpu River also resumed operations today. During this typhoon, all Chinese and foreign ships on the river were safe, but nine harbor barges, sampans, and small wooden boats were sunk or drifted away by the huge waves. More than 3,000 cubic meters of lumber were scattered, and more than 2,000 cubic meters have been recovered after two days of salvage. Twenty-five warehouses and forty grain depots along the river and in the near suburbs, storing cotton, matches, groceries, etc., had their roofs blown off, and more than 700 bales of cotton, matches, and grain were affected by moisture. They are currently being spread out to dry.

During this typhoon disaster, more than 1,990 houses in Shanghai were blown down or damaged. The Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau organized a rescue team of more than 4,000 people today to go deep into the streets and lanes to assist residents in repairing them. More than 10,000 residents who were evacuated from these houses have been housed in temporary residential resettlement stations. The government has issued relief funds to those among them who are experiencing financial difficulties. As of tonight, it has been confirmed that nine people died in the typhoon, and more than 100 people were injured, including more than 30 seriously injured who are being treated in hospitals.

The trees on both sides of the streets suffered great losses in the typhoon. About one-third of the trees were blown down or uprooted. Today, horticultural workers and the masses are rushing to repair them on the streets.

The 210,000 mu of cotton in the suburbs were generally blown down by the wind, and it is estimated that production will be reduced by 20%. About 80% of the 200,000 mu of vegetables were damaged to varying degrees. Today, many agricultural production cooperatives held symposiums with veteran farmers to study remedial measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd: Hangzhou City, which was hit by the typhoon, has returned to normal after two days of intense rescue and repair by the city's people. This morning, public buses had resumed normal operation. Most of the restaurants that had closed yesterday have reopened today, and many shops are cleaning and washing their shop windows. Various state-owned companies are busy organizing various sources of goods to ensure market supply. The supply of building materials is particularly busy, and large quantities of sack bags, lumber, and bamboo are being transported to the seawall and construction sites that need to repair houses. In order to ensure that the citizens whose houses collapsed can rebuild their homes, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to Xiaofeng and other places overnight to purchase bamboo.

As of 6:00 PM today, the vast majority of factories in the city have resumed work. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which was cut off by mountain floods, was reopened at noon today after more than 800 railway workers worked overnight to repair it. Five sections of the seawall on the Qiantang River, which were destroyed by the river tides, have now been repaired thanks to the repair work of thousands of workers, farmers, and PLA soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd: Under the strong typhoon invasion, thanks to the tenacious struggle of the broad masses of the people of Jiangsu Province, the main dikes of rivers, seas, and lakes stood firm, and land and water transportation has been restored. At present, the wind force in the coastal and inland areas of Jiangsu Province has been greatly reduced.

At present, Jiangsu is carrying out post-disaster work, and all cadres in various counties who can go to the countryside have gone deep into the rural areas. More houses have been blown down in coastal areas, and temporary resettlement is underway. The injured victims have received treatment.

The coastal areas of Jiangsu Province suffered more severely from this typhoon disaster, while the inland areas suffered less. Crops have suffered varying degrees of damage. Some of the intermediate rice and early rice have lodged, and some have been threshed; most of the tall-stalked crops such as sorghum and corn have been blown down, and some have been broken; cotton has suffered more losses. At present, agricultural production cooperatives in various places are carrying out drainage, support, soil addition, fertilizer application, and strengthening field management according to different circumstances.

The Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee organized four consolation groups, led by Jiangsu Provincial Vice Governor Ji Fang and others, and departed from Nanjing today to visit Songjiang, Suzhou, Nantong, Yancheng, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other places affected by the typhoon disaster.

    江苏各县干部下乡帮助农民抢救风灾
    据新华社上海3日电　上海今天解除台风警报，各个单位正在处理善后事宜。
    今天和昨天，六百多个电业工人，抢修了三千多处被风吹倒或吹断的电线杆和电线，到今晚，电路一度中断的工厂都已恢复供电；熄灭的路灯大部分也重新放明。黄浦江上的十七条对江轮渡线今天也大部分复航。这次台风中，江上的中国和外国轮船全部平安，但有九艘港内驳船、舢舨和小木船被巨浪击沉或漂走。漂散的三千多立方公尺木材，经过两天的打捞，已经收回了两千多立方公尺。江边和近郊一带有二十五个棉花、火柴、杂货等仓库和四十个粮食屯被风揭顶，受潮的棉花、火柴和粮食有七百多包，目前正在摊晾。
    这次台风灾害中，上海有一千九百九十多处房屋被风吹塌或吹坏。市房地产管理局今天组织了四千多人的抢救队，深入街巷里弄协助居民抢修，从这些房屋里迁出来的一万多名居民都已经住在临时的居民安居站内，政府已发给他们当中生活困难的人以救济金。到今晚为止，已经查明在台风中死亡的有九人，受伤的有一百多人，其中重伤的三十多人正在医院中治疗。
    街道两旁的树木在台风中受到很大损失，大约有三分之一的树木被风吹倒或连根拔起。今天园艺工人和群众正在街头抢修。
    郊区的二十一万亩棉花普遍被风吹倾斜了，估计要减产两成。二十万亩蔬菜大约有80％受到不同程度的损害。今天许多农业生产合作社开了老农民座谈会研究补救办法。
    新华社杭州3日电　遭受台风袭击的杭州市，经过两天来全市人民紧张的抢救抢修，市面已经恢复正常。今天清晨，公共汽车已恢复了正常行驶。昨天停止营业的饭店今天大部分都已开门，不少商店正在整理和洗涮橱窗。各个国营公司正在忙着组织各种货源保证市场供应。建筑器材的供应显得特别繁忙，大批麻袋木料和毛竹正在运往海塘和需要抢修房屋的工地上。市供销社为了保证房屋倒塌的市民重建家园，昨天连夜派人到孝丰等地采购毛竹。
    到今天下午六时止，全市工厂绝大部分都已经复工。被山洪冲断的浙赣铁路，经过八百多名铁路工人连夜抢修后，今天中午已经通车。被钱塘江江涛冲毁了五处的海塘堤岸，在数千名工人农民和解放军战士抢修下，现在也已修复了缺口。
    据新华社南京3日电　在这次强台风侵袭下，由于江苏省广大人民顽强斗争，江海河湖干堤屹立未动，水陆交通已经恢复。现在江苏省沿海和内陆地区风力已经大大减弱。
    目前，江苏各地正在进行善后工作，各县可以下乡的干部已经全部深入农村。沿海地区房屋刮倒较多，现在正在进行临时安置。受伤灾民已经得到治疗。
    江苏省沿海地区这次受台风灾害较重，内陆地区受灾较轻。农作物遭受了不同程度的损失。中稻、早稻有的倒伏，有的脱粒；高粱、玉米等高秆作物大部被风刮倒，有的折断；棉花损失较重。现在各地农业生产合作社正根据不同情况，进行排水、扶植、培土壅根、追肥和加强田间管理工作。
    江苏省人民委员会组织四个慰问组，由江苏省副省长季方等率领，今天从南京出发到受台风灾害的松江、苏州、南通、盐城、扬州、镇江等地进行慰问。
