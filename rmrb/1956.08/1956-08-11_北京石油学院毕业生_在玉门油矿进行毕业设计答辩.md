Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 9th. Four graduates from the Geology Department of the Beijing Petroleum Institute, who are graduating this summer, passed their graduation design defense at the Yumen Oilfield on the 7th.

Prior to their graduation design, these four graduates completed more than two months of internship at the Yumen Oilfield. With the assistance of engineering and technical personnel and workers at the Yumen Oilfield, they collected a great deal of data, drew many charts, and each wrote a design report ranging from over 40,000 to over 70,000 characters. The report by graduate Yang Shitie, "Detailed Exploration Design and Drive Problem Discussion for the Third District of the Shiyougou Oilfield," is of certain significance for accelerating the exploration of underground oil reserves in the Shiyougou Oilfield. In their design reports, graduates Wang Shuren and Ye Daxin both focused on elucidating how to develop the Laojunmiao Oilfield in an economically rational manner. During the defense, they used hanging charts, graphs, and key data to succinctly demonstrate the thematic significance of their design reports. When members of the National Examination Committee and the audience raised questions about their reports, they provided brief answers.

After the defense, Shen Naijing, Director of the Petroleum Geology Teaching and Research Section of the Beijing Petroleum Institute, told reporters: This year is the first time that graduates have conducted their graduation design defense on-site. The results of this examination prove that this approach can make the students' designs more practical, and can further verify and consolidate their theoretical knowledge.

    北京石油学院毕业生
    在玉门油矿进行毕业设计答辩
    新华社玉门9日电　北京石油学院地质系今年暑假毕业的四名毕业生，七日在玉门油矿现场通过了毕业设计答辩。
    这四名毕业生在作毕业设计以前，曾在玉门油矿进行了两个多月的实习，在玉门油矿工程技术人员和工人的帮助下，搜集了许多资料，画了很多图表，每人并且写出了长达四万多字到七万多字的设计报告。毕业生杨世铁的“石油沟油田第三区详探设计及驱动问题讨论”的报告，对加速探明石油沟油田的地下油储情况有一定意义。毕业生王书仁和叶大信都在他们的设计报告中，着重阐明了如何用经济合理的方法开发老君庙油田的问题。他们在答辩时，利用挂图、图表和主要数据，简明扼要地论证了他们的设计报告的主题意义，当国家考试委员会的委员和听众针对他们的报告提出一些问题质问时，他们也都简短地作了答复。
    答辩完毕以后，北京石油学院石油地质教研室主任沈乃菁对记者说：毕业生在现场进行毕业设计答辩，今年还是第一次。这次考试结果证明，这种做法，可以使学生们所作的设计更加切合实际，并且能进一步印证和巩固他们所学的理论知识。
