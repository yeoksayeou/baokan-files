Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, August 4th: Many Burmese newspapers have expressed concern over the exploitation of the fabricated news in the "Nation" newspaper about the Chinese army invading Burma to provoke the friendly relations between China and Burma, and have condemned such attempts to sow discord.

　　The Burmese "Federal Daily" published an editorial on August 3rd, accusing the Manila Treaty Organization of exposing its imperialist ambitions on the Sino-Burmese border issue.

　　The newspaper said: "When thousands of Kuomintang soldiers invaded Burma, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization remained completely silent. Not only that, we have been unable to point out in the United Nations that our aggressors are Kuomintang soldiers. We were forced to call them foreign troops."

　　The "Federal Daily" also said that when some countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization heard the news that so-called Communist Chinese soldiers had entered Burma, they "immediately showed more concern than Burma itself, and began to talk about the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization needing to consider taking action."

　　The newspaper concluded: The current problem can be resolved through discussions between the Burmese government and the Chinese government. "The unnecessary concern shown by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization only openly exposes their imperialist intentions, therefore, we want to warn them not to interfere in the affairs of other countries' people."

　　The "Rangoon Daily" accused on the same day that some American journalists and comments published by the Philippines and Taiwan were quite intolerable.

　　The newspaper warned: "There may be accusations and propaganda based on this news, and there are likely to be efforts to undermine the friendship between the two countries."

　　The "Tun Daily" pointed out on August 2nd that there have been exaggerated statements regarding the Sino-Burmese border issue, which would damage international friendly relations.

    缅报谴责挑拨中缅关系的企图
    据新华社仰光4日电　缅甸许多报纸对于“民族报”所捏造的关于中国军队侵入缅甸的消息被利用来挑拨中缅友好关系表示忧虑，并且对这种挑拨的企图表示谴责。
    缅甸“联邦报”在八月三日发表社论，指责马尼拉条约组织在中缅边界问题上暴露了它们的帝国主义野心。
    这家报纸说：“当成千的国民党人侵入缅甸的时候，东南亚条约组织一直是十分沉默的。不仅这样，我们还一直不能在联合国组织指出我们的侵略者是国民党人。我们被迫把他们称做外国军队。”
    “联邦报”还说，当东南亚条约组织的一些国家听到所谓共产党中国的士兵进入缅甸的消息时，它们“马上表现得比缅甸自己更关心，并且开始谈论东南亚条约组织需要考虑采取行动”。
    这家报纸最后说：当前的问题能够由缅甸政府和中国政府双方进行讨论而得到解决。“东南亚条约组织所表现的不必要的关心只是公开地暴露了它们的帝国主义意图，因此，我们要警告它们不要干涉其他国家人民的事务。”
    “仰光日报”同一天指责说，某些美国记者和菲律宾、台湾所发表的评论是相当令人不能忍受的。
    这家报纸警告说：“可能会有以这些消息为根据的指责和宣传，并且很可能会有破坏两国友谊的努力。”
    “吞报”在八月二日指出，对于中缅边界问题，曾有夸大的说法，这种说法是会破坏国际友好关系的。
