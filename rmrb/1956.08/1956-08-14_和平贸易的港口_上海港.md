    Peaceful Trade Port - Shanghai Port
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    The milky white morning mist condensing on the surface of the Huangpu River gradually dissipated, and golden sunlight sprinkled on the green trees of the Bund and the waves of the Huangpu River. The huge clock on the Customs Building, shining golden under the morning sun, struck six times, the loud chimes echoing on the silent river and the docks. Another day of work has begun.
    At this time, ships from Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries, anchored outside Wusongkou, raised their heavy iron anchors and slowly sailed into the Huangpu River with the tide. As the huge hull approached the Gaoyang Road Wharf outside the Suzhou Creek estuary, the blue and white checkered mooring flag was raised on the mast, the ship's whistle sounded a long blast, and the large ship smoothly approached the wharf. The sailors on the ship crowded onto the deck, cheerfully looking at the Shanghai Port illuminated by the morning sun.
    The docks became active due to the arrival of the ships. Staff from the Shanghai Customs, Border Inspection Station, and other units in uniform boarded the newly arrived ships. They conducted routine inspections in accordance with national laws. Staff from the Seamen's Union and the Shanghai Seamen's Club came aboard, extending warm hands to welcome friends who had traveled across the ocean to trade with China. The dockworkers started various transportation machines with a rumble, and soon began loading and unloading. Cranes continuously swung their long arms, lifting boxes of machines and large bags of fertilizer from the ship's hold, and loading neatly packaged Shanghai industrial products into the ship.
    The Gaoyang Road Wharf on the Huangpu River in Shanghai welcomes ships from the Mediterranean, the Bay of Bengal, and other places every day, and sends ships from various countries out of Shanghai Port every day. Although the United States imperialism and the Kuomintang clique have been implementing a military blockade and so-called "embargo" along the South China coast since 1951, the desire of people around the world to trade with New China cannot be blocked. In recent years, the number of ships from various countries coming to Gaoyang Road Wharf has been increasing day by day.
    Comrade Yan of the Shanghai Foreign Trade Bureau walked with me on the noisy Gaoyang Road Wharf. As he walked, he told me about the development of foreign trade in Shanghai Port. He said: The number of ships at Gaoyang Road Wharf has increased rapidly in recent years, more than six times more in 1955 than in 1951. The tonnage of import and export goods in Shanghai in 1955 increased by 8.8 times compared to 1951. It looks like this year will increase even more than last year.
    "Now more than sixty countries have established trade relations with Shanghai. In recent years, ships from many countries around the world have come to this Gaoyang Road Wharf. Ships from Britain and other countries have already established fixed routes." He excitedly told me, then he laughed: "Of course, American ships have not come, but they will realize sooner or later that this is not a loss for China, but it is not a cheap thing for them."
    On this day, there were seven foreign ships anchored on the river outside Gaoyang Road Wharf. Moored at the wharf were the Norwegian ship "Sea Queen" and the Dutch ship "Abbekerk". The "Sea Queen" had already loaded its cargo and was leaving Shanghai in the afternoon.
    The white "Abbekerk" was still loading cargo. A large part of these goods are industrial products produced in Shanghai. The "Abbekerk" will sail to Singapore, Hamburg, and other places the next day, and many industrial products will be shipped to Lagos and Tangier in Africa, places where Chinese industrial products are appearing for the first time in history.
    In the neatly decorated captain's cabin, I met Captain Roos of the "Abbekerk". This Dutch captain, who has lived at sea for decades, is very interested in the trade of New China. He said that in recent years, trade between the Netherlands and Shanghai has become more and more frequent, and goods from New China are very popular abroad. As early as 1929, the young Roos had come to Shanghai with a ship. This time, returning to the old place, he found that the Shanghai docks had undergone great changes, the loading and unloading efficiency had improved, the order on the docks was very good, and the phenomenon of cargo theft had been eliminated.
    "We must work hard to further develop trade between the Netherlands and Shanghai," Captain Roos said enthusiastically: "Next time, I will bring a new ship, and then I will definitely invite you to come to my ship again." He shook my hand vigorously.
    In order to let international friends understand the strong strength of Shanghai Port's foreign trade, thirteen foreign trade enterprises in Shanghai have arranged a delicate "Shanghai Export Commodity Exhibition Hall" on the ground floor of the Peace Hotel on the Shanghai Bund. After leaving the dock, I went there to visit. When I went, many foreign friends were appreciating it. Some were members of foreign trade delegations and foreign businessmen. In a few days, hundreds of representatives from more than fifty countries have visited this exhibition hall.
    Our country is under construction and needs not only a large number of machines and various commodities to import, but also has more things to exchange with foreign countries. Shanghai Port now exports a total of more than 6,500 kinds of commodities, and more than 1,000 important varieties are displayed here.
    Among these commodities, industrial products are particularly eye-catching. It almost occupies half of the exhibition hall. In recent years, the export of Shanghai industrial products has been increasing day by day. In the first quarter of this year, the proportion of industrial products in the total value of Shanghai's export commodities has reached about half, and there are more than 3,000 varieties of exported industrial products. This is a huge change in Shanghai Port's foreign trade. On display here today are various Shanghai-produced steel products, high-quality textile machines, various medical devices, radio receivers, film projectors, various chemical raw materials, advanced drawing instruments, 1,500-times microscopes, telecommunications equipment... Many of the commodities here were once listed on the import list, some even as recently as two or three years ago, but now they are proudly displayed here as export commodities.
    Friends from Asian and African countries are most interested in these export industrial products. Many of the industrial products displayed here are no longer unfamiliar to them. Shanghai-produced bicycles have long been running on the shady boulevards of Yangon; Shanghai's Wudi brand sewing machines have become capable assistants for housewives in Singapore (exports in the third quarter of last year increased by 48 times compared with the first quarter); spring clothes made of Shanghai's White Cat floral cloth are the most beautiful costumes for girls in Jakarta. After 16mm film projectors were sold to India, an Indian company wrote to say that they were willing to take on the exclusive sales of this film projector. Shanghai-made spinning machines, weaving machines, cigarette machines, knitting machines, and other machines have also appeared in factories in Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Singapore, and other places.
    Our friends are attracted by these exhibits. Some are carefully observing and listening to the introduction of the translators; some are discussing and taking notes at any time, or asking the staff for product brochures. On the table at the entrance of the exhibition hall, there is a thick, cloth-bound, exquisitely decorated "Guest Book". Visitors have left their opinions in various languages such as Russian, English, Japanese, French... Some wrote: "After seeing this exhibition hall, I hope to trade with China even more." Some wrote: "I hope these commodities can be bought in our country." Different languages and different sentences express a common desire: to trade with New China. When I was reading this "Guest Book", I couldn't help but think of the recent events in the international trade community regarding the lifting of rubber embargoes in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and other places. Obviously, the "embargo" dam can no longer stop this torrent. Everything here is the most powerful proof.
    At night, the loading and unloading work at Gaoyang Road Wharf is still going on. The electric lights illuminate the wharf as if it were daytime. The large seagoing vessels anchored on the river are also brightly lit, and the dazzling searchlights shine straight into the distance. The lights are reflected on the Huangpu River, shadowy, forming a magnificent night scene of the Huangpu River.
    Seamen on the sea vessels who are not working are enjoying themselves at the Shanghai Seamen's Club on Hankou Road, not far from the Huangpu River. This club was specially established by the Shanghai Seamen's Union to receive seamen brothers from various countries. It has various facilities that seamen love: a bar, a billiard room, a reading room, various sports rooms, a Chinese goods purchasing department, and three cultural and entertainment performances are held every week. Every night, seamen of various skin colors, speaking various languages, and traveling on the sea all year round to promote international peaceful trade, gather in groups to spend a happy night here.

    和平贸易的港口——上海港
    本报记者　季音
    凝聚在黄浦江江面上的乳白色的朝雾渐渐散去，一片金色的阳光洒落在外滩的绿树丛上，洒落在黄浦江波涛上。被朝阳照射得金光闪烁的海关大楼上的巨钟，“当当”地响了六下，洪亮的钟声在静寂的江面上，在码头上回响着。劳动的一天又开始了。
    这时候，停泊在吴淞口外的英国、荷兰以及其他国家的船只，拉起了大铁锚，顺着潮水，缓缓地驶进黄浦江。当巨大的船身快要驶近苏州河口外的高阳路码头的时候，船桅杆上升起了蓝白色方格子的停泊旗，船上汽笛长鸣，大船就平稳地靠拢了码头。船上的水手拥到甲板上，轻松愉快地眺望着在一片朝阳照耀下的上海港。
    码头上由于船只的到来而活跃了起来。穿着制服的上海海关、边防检查站等单位的工作人员走上了新来的大船。他们按照国家的法令进行例行的检查。海员工会和上海海员俱乐部的工作人员来到了船上，他们伸出了热情的手，欢迎远涉重洋前来同中国进行贸易的朋友们。码头装卸区的人们隆隆地开动了各式运输机械，很快就开始了装卸工作。吊杆不停地挥动着长臂，从船舱里吊出一箱箱的机器和大包肥田粉，又把包装得整整齐齐的上海的各种工业品吊进去。
    上海黄浦江边的高阳路码头，每天迎接着来自地中海、孟加拉湾等地的船只，每天又把来自各国的船只送出上海港。尽管从1951年以来，美帝国主义和国民党集团就在南中国沿海实行着军事封锁和所谓“禁运”，但是世界各国人民要同新中国进行贸易的愿望是封锁不住的。这几年来，高阳路码头上来往的各国船只，竟是一天比一天多了。
    上海对外贸易局的严同志带着我在闹声震耳的高阳路码头上走着，他一边走，一边告诉我关于上海港对外贸易发展的一些情况。他说：这几年来高阳路码头上的船只增加得很快，1955年比1951年增加了六倍多。1955年上海进出口货物吨数比1951年增加了八点八倍。看样子，今年比起去年，将要增加得更多。
      “现在已经有六十几个国家同上海建立了贸易关系，这几年世界上许多国家的船只都到过这高阳路码头，英国等不少国家的轮船都已经建立了固定的班次。”他兴奋地对我说，接着，他又笑了起来：“当然，美国的船没有来，不过他们迟早会发觉，这对中国并不是什么损失，而对他们并不是什么便宜的事。”
    这天高阳路码头外的江面上，有七艘外国海船停泊着，靠码头停泊着的是挪威的“海后”号和荷兰的“阿比克克”号两艘船。“海后”号已经把货装好了，它在下午就要离开上海。
    白色的“阿比克克”号还在继续装货。这些货物里有很大一部分是上海出产的工业品。“阿比克克”号第二天就要驶往新加坡、汉堡等地，有许多工业品将运往非洲拉哥斯和丹吉尔等地，这些地方都是历史上第一次出现中国的工业品。
    在装饰得很整洁的船长室里，我见到了“阿比克克”号的船长罗斯。这个在海上生活了几十年的荷兰船长对新中国的贸易有着很大的兴趣。他说，这几年来荷兰同上海之间的贸易往来越来越频繁了，新中国的货物在国外是很受欢迎的。远在1929年，年青的罗斯就曾随船来过上海，这次旧地重来，他发现上海码头上有了很大的变化，装卸效率提高了，码头上秩序很好，货物被窃的现象消除了。
      “我们要努力使荷兰同上海的贸易进一步发展起来，”罗斯船长热情地说：“下次，我将要带一艘新船来，那时候，我一定请你们再到我的船上来。”他用力地握着我的手。
    为了让国际友人们了解上海港对外贸易的雄厚实力，上海十三个对外贸易企业在上海外滩和平饭店的底层布置了一个精致的“上海出口商品陈列厅”。我在离开了码头之后，就顺道走到那里去参观。当我去的时候，正有许多国外友人在那里鉴赏着。他们有的是国外贸易代表团的人员和外国商人。几天中，已有五十多个国家的几百个代表参观了这个陈列厅。
    我们的国家正在建设，不但需要大量的机器和各种商品进口，而且也有了更多的东西，可以同国外交换。上海港现在一共出口着六千五百多种商品，在这里陈列的是其中的一千多种重要品种。
    在这些商品中，工业品特别引人注目。它几乎占据了陈列厅一半的地位。这几年来上海工业品的出口一天天增加着，今年第一季度，上海出口商品总值中，工业品所占的比重已达到一半左右，出口的工业品有三千多种品种。这是上海港对外贸易的一个巨大变化。今天陈列在这里的有上海生产的各种钢材、质量优良的纺织机器、各式医疗器械、无线电收音机、电影放映机、各种化工原料、高级绘图仪器、一千五百倍的显微镜、电讯器材，……这里的许多商品，在过去一直是被列在进口货单上的，有的甚至在两三年前还是如此，但现在却被作为出口商品，骄傲地陈列在这里了。
    亚非国家的朋友对这些出口工业品兴趣最大，这里陈列的不少工业品对于他们已经不是陌生的了。上海出产的自行车早已驰骋在仰光的林荫大道上；上海无敌牌缝纫机已经成了新加坡主妇们的得力助手（去年第三季度出口比第一季度增加了四十八倍）；用上海的白猫花布做的春装是雅加达姑娘们最漂亮的一种服装。十六毫米的电影放映机销往印度后，印度一家公司来信说：他们愿意包销这种电影机。上海制造的细纱机、织布机、卷烟机、针织机以及其他机器，也都已经出现在缅甸、越南民主共和国、新加坡等地的工厂里。
    我们的朋友们被这些陈列品吸引着，他们有的在仔细地观摩，听取着翻译人员的介绍；有的议论着，并且随时记下一点什么，或者向工作人员索取商品介绍单。陈列厅门 口的桌上，摆着一本厚厚的布面精装的“留言簿”，参观者用俄文、英文、日文、法文，……等各种文字，留下了他们的意见。有的写着：“看了这个陈列厅后，我更希望同中国进行贸易了。”有的写着：“我希望这些商品都能在我们国家买到。”各种不同的文字，各种不同的语句，倾吐着一个共同的愿望：同新中国进行贸易。当我翻读着这本“留言薄”的时候，不禁想起了最近轰动国际贸易界的关于马来亚、新加坡、印度尼西亚等地取消橡胶禁运的事件。显然，“禁运”的堤防是再也挡不住这个巨流了。这里的一切就是最有力的证明。
    夜晚，高阳路码头上的装卸工作还在继续进行着，电灯光把码头上照耀得如同白昼，停泊在江边的大海轮上也是灯火通明，耀眼的探照灯光直射到远处，灯光倒映在黄浦江上，影影绰绰，构成了一幅瑰丽的黄浦江夜景。
    海轮上没有工作的海员们，这时候在离黄浦江不远的汉口路上海海员俱乐部里尽情地欢乐着。这个俱乐部是上海的海员工会为了接待来自各国的海员弟兄而专门设立的，这里有着海员们所喜爱的各种设备：酒吧间、弹子房、书报室、各种运动室、中国物品购买部，一星期里还举行三次文娱演出。每天晚上，各种肤色、操着各种语言、为开展国际和平贸易而终年颠簸在海上的海员们，成群结队地在这里度过快乐的夜晚。（附图片）
