    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 16th: The Board of Directors of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority held a meeting on August 15th and decided to continue large-scale improvements to the canal and increase its navigability.
    The Board condemned the former Suez Canal Company for attempting to delay the canal's improvement and maintenance work, and decided to establish a technical committee to study the continued large-scale improvements to the canal.
    The Board also decided to improve the methods of ship passage through the canal to cope with the increasing number of ships needing to pass through the canal, mainly tankers.
