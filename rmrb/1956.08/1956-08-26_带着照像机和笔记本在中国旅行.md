    Traveling in China with a Camera and Notebook
    By Soviet Writer Vera Ketlinskaya

    One morning in Shanghai, we looked out of the window. The sky was clear, but the morning mist still lingered over the city. From the top of the eight-story building, even the neighboring houses were indistinguishable. After a while, the morning mist suddenly disappeared, and before us, emerging clearly from the white fog, was the green grass of the sports field, with moving figures on it. How sudden and incredible! Agile young men and women were racing along the track; some were playing tennis, throwing the discus; others were doing gymnastics...

    During this month we spent in China, how many times in the morning did we see people running long distances along the streets or boulevards with steady and persistent steps, how many times were we pleased to see so many people swimming on the beach, how many people were exercising in the stadium, and how pleasantly and neatly we saw workers, staff, and students doing a few minutes of gymnastics, the sound of the broadcast making everyone invigorated, stretching their muscles, and moving vigorously.

    This is a young China full of health and energy, eager to work and be happy.

    Many travelers and tourists who have visited China have photographed the admirable temples and the miserable houses, peasant women and boat girls carrying children, thousands of Chinese junks serving as homes for poor families, and rickshaw pullers dragging lazy passengers along the streets, farmers working in the rice paddies with water up to their knees...

    Now many things have changed. The "Chinese Junk City" can no longer be found in Shanghai. The families who used to live on the water have moved to the countryside, where they have switched to agriculture and joined cooperatives. Rickshaws have been replaced by pedicabs and are being prepared to be replaced by motorized tricycles. "Dragon Beard Ditch," the oldest slum in Beijing, is unrecognizable. Many comfortable workers' residential areas have appeared. Both mothers and children are receiving care from the state. The magnificent and luxurious parks and palaces have become places of rest for thousands upon thousands of working people...

    Of course, in six years, it is impossible to eliminate poverty and illiteracy in such a large country with a population of 600 million. It is still possible to see women carrying children, rickshaws, people living on the water, dilapidated small thatched houses...

    We believe that some bourgeois photojournalists are clearly eager to photograph all of this, hoping to use these photos to slander free China. But all these photos can only serve one purpose—to prove conclusively that the accusations of the imperialist bourgeoisie, who have been exploiting the blood and sweat of the Chinese people and plunging them into poverty for many years, are powerless!

    I would like to say a few words to these photojournalists: "Aren't you eager to photograph poverty and shortcomings? Hurry up and photograph them, hurry up and photograph them well. In a few years, these photos will not leave any trace. Everyone will forget them, just like they forgot opium and the Anglo-American 'masters'!"

    The three of us Soviet writers also photographed the characteristics of the past era, so that these characteristics could enter our Chinese photo album as evidence of the barbaric "civilization" that the imperialists attempted to impose on the Chinese people.

    However, prominently featured in this photo album is the former private residence of the British opium magnate, Gaotouli, a beautiful courtyard with a luxurious garden, where the Young Pioneers of Shanghai are now spending their wonderful and beneficial time!

    Alongside the remaining small thatched houses of "Dragon Beard Ditch" is prominently displayed: in the place where there used to be a stinking ditch, there are now excellent roads and magnificent stadiums built by free people to make their youth live a happy life.

    We also photographed the marvelous temples and imperial palaces. These temples and palaces are very beautiful. For many centuries, they have demonstrated the genius and diligence of the Chinese people, how poetic the artistic imagination of the Chinese people is, and how skillful the hands of the Chinese people are. However, our photos also naturally contain things that prove China's new life—there are female students preparing for exams in the shade of the high walls of the palace; there are glass-covered children's cars transporting children from Beijing's kindergartens to the imperial parks for outings; there are crowds of workers, young people, and children happily touring the Summer Palace of Empress Dowager Cixi.

    We photographed the old villages with narrow streets and small courtyards, but our lenses also captured the Young Pioneers returning from school with books in their hands, young mothers taking their children to doctors at rural clinics, and cooperative activists attending meetings of the cooperative management committee set up in the former landlord's houses. It is true that the mechanization of China's countryside is still very poor, but the double-wheeled double-furrow plow replacing the wooden plows and hoes passed down by ancestors, coupled with better organization of labor, has greatly increased the yields of young cooperatives and brought wealth to the families of former poor peasants and farm laborers... Their backs are straightened, the lines on their faces have disappeared, and the peasants look to the future happily and confidently—this is also recorded in our photo album, because a person's eyes are a mirror of his soul, and we saw proud, happy eyes...

    How many outstanding, intelligent, and talented Chinese workers did we meet during our short trip! We treasure these figures in our negatives.

    Li, a young woman from a village near Guangzhou, a former farm laborer who is now the chairman of the Women's Federation and one of the activists of the cooperative, is a young woman with great prestige among the villagers, which she has won through her work to seek happiness for the people—organizing rural nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, and production teams... We took pictures of her and her one-year-old child, and she proudly called her child a national hero.

    Li Qingyuan, the son of a poor peddler from Guangdong, embarked on the Party's path of struggle for a better future very early, and secretly engaged in the printing of Communist Party newspapers during the Kuomintang rule... Now this 28-year-old Communist Party member has been promoted to the director of a joint state-private chemical factory.

    Xiao Chuanren, a young engineer and outstanding worker on the Yangtze River Bridge construction site, is a rapidly growing bridge builder, despite his young age. He and his comrades brilliantly completed the complex drilling work under the most difficult conditions on the deep Yangtze River with its rapid currents...

    Hu Yuesheng, a sixteen-year-old girl from a new workers' village in Shanghai, is an activist in the public organization of the workers' village. In the evenings, she is an enthusiastic teacher, teaching older people to read in literacy classes...

    Guan Shuzhen is an old female worker and female Communist Party member (although she is not that old in terms of age), a participant in the general strike of the Shanghai textile factories, and she was injured in a conflict with the Kuomintang army... Now, this woman has become the deputy director of that factory. Eight years ago, she was using the slogan of "rice and coal" to mobilize female workers to fight in this factory.

    These people, and many others, represent the appearance of the Chinese people today! They are the builders of a new free life, they are the bright future of the country.

    We took many photos with great interest, with growing excitement and love, asked questions in detail, and studied many things. We originally hoped to learn and study all the things, but the more fulfilling and interesting the days were, the faster they passed. We originally wanted to capture all the major events of the Chinese people in our lenses, but no lens can capture all these great undertakings and plans, the enthusiasm of the builders, and the wise and purposeful will of the Party and the government that leads the entire people to engage in learning and transformation...

    When leaving this beautiful and great country that is already very dear to us, there is only one thing we desire, to tell the Soviet readers well, even if only partially, what we have seen and heard and what we like. (Special Contribution to this Newspaper)

    带着照像机和笔记本在中国旅行
    苏联作家　薇拉·凯特玲斯卡娅
    在上海，有一天早晨，我们从窗口向外面看，天空是晴朗的，但是晨雾仍然萦绕着城市，从八层楼的高顶上甚至连邻近的房屋都分辨不清。一会儿，晨雾忽然消失了，在我们面前，从白雾里清晰地出现了运动场的绿色的草地，草地上有移动的人。这是多么突然而不可思议啊！动作灵巧的青年男女沿着跑道赛跑；有的在打网球，掷铁饼；有的在作体操……
    我们在中国所度过的这一个月中，有多少次我们在早晨都看到沿着大街或林荫道步伐均匀和坚持不懈地练习长跑的人，有多少次我们愉快地看到许多人都在海滨上游泳，多么多的人都在体育场上锻练，我们还看见工人、职员、学生在多么愉快和整齐地作几分钟的体操，广播的声音使每一个人不由得振奋起来，舒展开筋肉，用力地动作起来。
    这是充满了健康和精力、渴望着劳动和幸福的年轻的中国。
    访问中国的许多旅行者和游览者，都曾拍照了使人赞叹的庙宇和使人悲惨的房子，背着孩子的农妇和船娘，数以千计的作为穷人家庭住宅的中国帆船和拉着懒洋洋的乘客沿着大街奔跑的人力车夫，站在水到膝盖的稻田里做活的农民……
    现在许多事情都改变了，在上海已经找不到“中国帆船城”，过去住在水上的人家搬到农村去了，他们改为从事农业，参加了合作社；人力车改变成三轮车，并准备改成机动三轮车；北京最老的贫民窟——“龙须沟”已变得认不出来了，许多舒适的工人住宅区出现了；无论是母亲，无论是儿童都受到了国家的关怀；那华丽奢侈的公园和宫殿成了成千上万的劳动人民休息的地方……
    当然，在六年之中，不可能在这样一个六亿人口的大国里消灭贫困和文盲，现在仍然还可以看到背着孩子的妇女，人力车，住在水上的人，破旧的小茅舍……
    我们认为，有些资产阶级的摄影记者显然急于要把所有这些都拍照下来，希望利用这些照片来诽谤自由的中国，但是所有这些照片只能起这样一种作用——确凿地证明许多年都在压榨中国人民血汗和使他们陷入贫困的帝国主义资产阶级的非难是无力的！
    我想对这些摄影记者谈几句话：“你们不是急于拍照贫困和缺点吗？你们赶快拍照吧，好好地赶快拍照吧，再过几年后，这些照片不会留下任何痕迹的，大家都会忘记它们，就像忘记鸦片和英美的‘主子’一样！”
    我们三个苏联作家也把过去时代的特点拍下来，让这些特点进入我们的中国影集里，以便作为帝国主义者企图强加在中国人民身上的那种野蛮的“文明”的证据。
    但是，在这个影集里占显著地位的是从前的“鸦片大王”英国人加陶里的私邸，这是一个有着一个豪华的花园的美妙的大院子，现在上海的少先队员正在这里愉快和有益地度过他们的美妙时光！
    同“龙须沟”的残余的小茅舍并列在显著地位的是：在以前有臭水沟的那个地方，出现了极好的马路和自由人民为了使自己的青年过愉快的生活而建筑的宏伟的体育馆。
    我们也拍了奇妙的庙宇和帝王的宫殿。这些庙宇和宫殿十分美丽，它们在很多世纪中都证明中国人民的天才和勤劳，中国人民的艺术想像力多么富于诗意，中国人民的双手是多么巧妙。但是，在我们的照片中当然也有证明中国新生活的事物——有在皇宫的高墙下的绿荫中准备考试的女学生；有把北京的幼儿园的儿童们送到帝王的公园里游玩的镶有玻璃的儿童车；有在慈禧太后的颐和园中愉快游览的劳动者、青年和儿童的人群。
    我们拍下了有狭窄的街道和窄小的院子的古老的乡村，但是，在我们的镜头里也拍下了从学校里放学回来的拿着书的少先队员，把自己的孩子抱到农村诊所医生那里看病的年青的母亲，在设在过去地主房子里的合作社管理委员会开会的合作社积极分子。固然，中国农村的机械化还很差，但是，双轮双铧犁代替祖先传下来的木犁和锄头，加上更好地组织劳动，已经大大地提高了年青的合作社的农作物的产量，给从前的贫农和雇农的家庭带来了富裕……脊背伸直了，面纹消失了，农民们愉快地、满怀信心地看着未来——这也收在我们的影集里，因为人的眼睛是他的灵魂的一面镜子，而我们看到了骄傲的、幸福的眼睛……
    在我们短期的旅行中遇到了多少优秀的、聪明的、天才的中国劳动者啊！我们非常珍贵地把这些人物保存在我们的底片中。
    广州近郊农村来的一位过去的雇农，现在是妇联的主席和合作社的积极分子之一的李女，是一个青年妇女，她在本村人中威信很高，这种威信是用为人民谋幸福的工作——组织农村的托儿所、幼儿园，产院和生产队……——来赢得的。我们为她和她的一周岁的孩子拍了照，她骄傲地称自己的孩子为民族英雄。
    广东的一个贫苦小贩的儿子李清元，很早就走上了党的为争取美好的未来的斗争的道路，并在国民党统治时期，秘密从事共产党报纸的印刷工作……现在这位二十八岁的共产党员已被提任为一个公私合营的化学工厂的厂长。
    虽然年轻，但却已经闻名的迅速成长的桥梁建筑者，长江大桥工地的优秀工作者——青年工程师萧传仁和他的同伴们在水流很急的深邃的长江上，在最困难的条件下卓越地完成了复杂的钻探工作……。
    从上海一个新的工人村来的小姑娘，十六岁的胡月生是工人村居民的公共组织的积极分子，在晚间，她是一个热心的教员，在扫盲班里教年老的人们识字……。
    关淑珍是一个老女工和女共产党员（虽然按年龄说并不大），上海纺织工厂总罢工的参加者，她在同国民党军队的冲突中受了伤……现在，这个女人已成为那个厂的副厂长，八年前，她正是在这个厂里用“米和煤”的口号来鼓动女工们进行斗争。
    这些人以及其他许多人，就代表着今天中国人民的外貌！他们是新的自由生活的建设者，他们是国家的光明的未来。
    我们怀着热烈的兴趣，怀着不断增长的兴奋和热爱，拍了许多照片，详细问东问西，并研究了许多事物。我们原希望能学习和研究到所有的事物，但是日子越是充实而有趣，它们就越过得飞快。我们原想把中国人民的所有重大事件摄入我们的镜头，但是任何镜头都不能把这些伟大的事业和计划，建设者的热情，领导全体人民从事学习和改造工作的党和政府的英明而有目的性的意志……全部拍下来。
    在离开这个对我们已是十分亲切的美丽而伟大的国家的时候，我们所渴望的只有一件事，要好好地，哪怕是部分地，把我们的所见所闻和我们所喜欢的告诉苏联的读者。　（本报特约稿）
