Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch: Democratic National Committee Chairman Butler, in a statement on July 29, praised the "Dump Nixon Movement" initiated by Republican Stassen.

Butler, answering reporters' questions on a television program, stated that he believed Stassen would never launch the anti-Nixon movement "on his own strength." He himself "tended to think" that White House officials were supporting Stassen.

Butler also believed that Nixon was the "most vulnerable person" among the Republican vice presidential candidates in this year's election.

He criticized the White House for dishonestly announcing news about Eisenhower's health. He said that reporters could only get relevant information from the White House press officer and not from the doctors. He stated that Eisenhower's health was closely related to the election, as many people doubted whether Eisenhower had the physical strength to serve another four years as president.

It is reported that Republican National Committee Chairman Hall, who had originally firmly supported Nixon, has indicated that he is willing to let Stassen or anyone else nominate "any vice presidential candidate he wishes to nominate" at the upcoming Republican National Convention.

    史塔生发起的“倒尼克松运动”继续发展
    据传美共和党全国委员会主席愿意考虑其他候选人
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：民主党全国委员会主席巴特勒在七月二十九日发表谈话，称赞共和党史塔生所发起的“倒尼克松运动”。
    巴特勒在电视节目上答复记者问题时表示，他相信史塔生绝不会“只凭自己的力量”来发起倒尼克松的运动。他本人“趋向于认为”：白宫官员们是支持史塔生的。
    巴特勒也认为尼克松是今年大选中共和党副总统候选人中“最易受指责的人”。
    他批评白宫不老实宣布艾森豪威尔健康状况的消息。他说，记者只能从白宫新闻发布官那里，而不能从医生那里得到有关的消息。他表示艾森豪威尔的健康同选举有着很密切关系。因为不少人怀疑艾森豪威尔的体力是否能再胜任四年总统。
    有消息说，本来坚决支持尼克松的共和党全国委员会主席霍尔已经表示他愿意让史塔生或任何其他人在未来的共和党代表大会上提名“任何一个他愿意提的副总统候选人”。
