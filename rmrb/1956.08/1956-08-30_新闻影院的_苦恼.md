    Newsreel Cinema's "Distress"
    Sun ShikKai
    "Some newsreels that are very popular with the audience cannot be shown in our cinema. Then, what kind of films should we show?" The business personnel of the Red Star Cinema, Beijing's only newsreel cinema, seemed a little agitated when talking to me about the film distribution department's scheduling issues.

    Another businessperson sitting next to him immediately added an example. "For example, the color documentary film 'Bulganin and Khrushchev Visit Britain' was not allotted to our newsreel cinema." According to them, although the cinema's business personnel had repeatedly requested the film distribution department, based on the demands of many viewers, to screen the film simultaneously with other cinemas showing feature films, the response they received was a cold "not allowed."

    This newsreel cinema has encountered such things more than once or twice. The two enthusiastic business personnel continuously cited numerous similar examples, which seemed like they couldn't finish talking about them even in one or two hours. For example, the musical film "Yellow River Cantata," recording the masterpieces of people's musician Xian Xinghai, was screened in many cinemas in Beijing as early as April; however, the Red Star Cinema was not only unable to screen it at that time but couldn't even promote it in advance. It was delayed again and again until July 10th before the film was screened. The newly released documentary "The Happy Road to Lhasa" was shown in other cinemas for nine screenings before the Red Star Cinema received notification that they could screen the film, but then they suddenly received a "ban" and could not screen it as scheduled.

    Why does the film distribution department not allow these very popular documentary films to be screened in the newsreel cinema—the Red Star Cinema? The reason given is: newsreel cinemas can only screen science, education, and newsreel short films. The films mentioned above are longer and exceed the screening time per show in the newsreel cinema. Moreover, the ticket price in general cinemas is 25 cents, while the ticket price in the Red Star Cinema, which specializes in newsreels, is only 10 cents. Screening these documentary films simultaneously in the newsreel cinema would affect the film rental fees to be recovered. I believe these reasons are untenable. Let's talk about time and ticket prices, couldn't it be a bit more flexible? When screening long documentaries, extend the time and appropriately increase the ticket price. In this way, not only can the audience watch more films in the Red Star Cinema, but the film distribution department can also recover the deserved film rental fees. As for whether the rule that newsreel cinemas can only screen science, education, and newsreel short films is reasonable, just look at the actual situation. At present, the number of science, education, and newsreel short films produced and translated in our country is still not large. When these types of short films are not available, newsreel cinemas still have to schedule long documentaries. The Red Star Cinema screened long documentaries such as "Vietnam" and "Kuban State Farm" for this reason. Since this rule cannot be enforced, doesn't it become just empty talk? And being allowed to screen long documentaries one moment and not allowed the next only makes the business personnel of the newsreel cinema even more distressed. Because they are even more confused about what kind of films the newsreel cinema should screen.

    After talking back and forth with the business personnel of the Red Star Cinema, we finally reached a common conclusion: It is inappropriate to limit the films screened in newsreel cinemas to a very narrow range. This is a question of attitude towards the newly established newsreel cinemas. Newsreel cinemas have not been established for long in various places and need strong support from relevant departments to make them one of the best places to introduce domestic and foreign news and promote scientific knowledge to the masses, so that they will be valued and loved by the audience. Setting out many "strict rules and regulations" for newsreel cinemas is tantamount to putting a rope around the neck of newsreel cinemas, restricting their growth and development.

    新闻影院的“苦恼”
    孙世恺
    “有些很受观众欢迎的新闻纪录影片，我们影院不能放映。那么，我们究竟应该放映什么影片呢？”北京市唯一的新闻影院——红星电影院的业务人员在跟我谈到影片发行部门排片问题时，显然有点激动了。
    旁边坐着的另一个业务人员紧接着又补充了一个例子。“例如‘布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问英国’的彩色文献纪录影片，就没有我们新闻影院的份。”据他们说，影院业务人员虽然根据许多观众的要求三番五次地去请求影片发行部门，希望能和其他放映故事片的影院同时上映这部影片，但得到的答复却是冷冰冰的“不准”。
    这座新闻影院碰到这样的事情，何止一两次。两个热心的业务人员连续举出许许多多类似的事例，看样子一两个小时也说不完。例如：记录人民音乐家冼星海名作的音乐片“黄河大合唱”，早在四月里就由北京市许多影院上映；但是红星电影院当时不仅不能放映，就连先宣传一下都不成。一拖再拖，直到七月十日才上映了这部影片。新出的纪录片“通向拉萨的幸福道路”，在其它影院放映九场之后，红星电影院才得到他们可以上映这部影片的通知，但是后来又突然接到“禁令”，不能如期上映了。
    影片发行部门为什么不让这些很受观众欢迎的纪录影片在新闻影院——红星电影院放映呢？据说理由是：新闻影院只能放映科学、教育、新闻纪录短片。上边说的那些影片较长，超过了新闻影院每场的放映时间。而且一般影院的票价是二角五，专放新闻影片的红星电影院票价只一角，这些纪录影片同时在新闻影院放映，要影响应收回的片租费。这些理由，我认为是不能成立的。就以时间和票价来谈吧，难道不可以灵活一点吗？在放映长纪录片时，延长时间，同时适度地增加票价，这样不但观众可以在红星电影院看到更多的影片，影片发行部门也能够同样收回应得的片租费。至于新闻影院只能上映科学、教育、新闻纪录短片这个规定是否合理，只要看看实际情况就知道了。目前我国生产、译制的科学、教育、新闻纪录短片数量还不多。在这类短片供应不上的时候，新闻影院仍不得不排上长纪录片。红星电影院就是因为这个缘故而上映了长纪录片，如“越南”、“库班国营农场”等。既然这个规定不能执行，那么它不就成了一句空话了吗？而一会长纪录片可以放，一会又不可以放，只是更叫新闻影院的业务人员苦恼吧了。因为他们更加弄不清楚，到底新闻影院应该放映什么影片了。
    和红星影院的业务人员谈来谈去，最后得到了一个共同的结论：把新闻影院上映的影片局限在一个非常狭窄的范围之内是不妥当的。这是对待新生的新闻影院的态度问题。新闻影院在各地开办不久，需要有关部门大力支持，使它成为向群众介绍国内外新闻和宣传科学知识的最好场所之一，才会受到观众的重视和爱护。给新闻影院订出许多“清规戒律”，无异于在新闻影院的脖子上套上一条绳子，限制了它的成长和发展。
