Xinhua News Agency, London, August 24th. The London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue concluded here on August 23rd. Without any resolutions or communiqués, the conference merely agreed to send a verbatim record of the conference proceedings to the Egyptian government.

This outcome of the conference signifies the failure of Western countries' attempt to force the conference to agree to the Western plan and then order Egypt to accept it. On the 22nd, the conference was on the verge of collapse when the New Zealand representative, supported by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries, suddenly suggested that the conference should only submit the American plan to the Egyptian government. This suggestion was met with strong opposition from the Soviet Union, Ceylon, and India.

It is understood that the representatives of India, Indonesia, and Ceylon held talks on the morning of the 23rd and decided that if Western countries insisted on forcibly passing their unilateral proposals, they would withdraw from the conference.

In order to avoid the complete collapse of the conference, the head of the British delegation, Lloyd, said at the August 23rd meeting that he believed there was no need to issue a communiqué or take any formal action other than reiterating the guarantee he had already made to submit a verbatim record of the conference proceedings to the Egyptian government.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Shepilov, put forward a draft conference communiqué based on discussing two plans—the American plan and the Indian plan—with the Egyptian government.

The head of the French delegation, Pineau, said that since there was unanimous agreement not to vote, it would be impossible to reach a consensus on a communiqué. He said there were no conclusions that could be recorded in a communiqué.

The New Zealand representative read out a "statement of intent" at the meeting, announcing that the seventeen governments that supported the Dulles Plan had requested representatives from Australia, Ethiopia, Iran, Sweden, and the United States, chaired by Australian Prime Minister Menzies, to contact the Egyptian government to explain the purposes and objectives of the Dulles Plan and to ascertain whether Egypt agreed to negotiate on this basis.

Shepilov strongly opposed presenting unilateral opinions.

Menon said that the current statement by New Zealand was different from his previous statement. He did not object to the current statement by New Zealand because it was merely a statement of intent and not a proposal submitted to the conference. However, Menon still believed that it would be best to present both the Dulles Plan and his plan to Egypt.

The conference finally declared its end after a motion was unanimously agreed to send a verbatim record of the conference proceedings to Egypt.

    苏印等国坚决反对侵犯埃及主权
    伦敦会议没有通过任何决议而结束
    西方国家想使会议强令埃及接受西方方案的企图遭到失败
    新华社伦敦24日电　讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议八月二十三日在这里闭幕。没有任何决议或公报，会议仅仅同意把会议进程的逐字记录送交埃及政府。
    会议的这种结局，标志着西方国家想要强迫会议同意西方方案然后再命令埃及接受的企图没有能够成功。在二十二日，会议曾经濒临垮台的边缘，当时新西兰代表在英、法、美等国的支持下，突然建议会议只应当把美国的方案提交埃及政府。这个建议遭到苏联、锡兰和印度的激烈反对。
    据了解，印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰三国的代表二十三日上午曾经举行会谈，决定如果西方国家仍然要强行通过它们的片面建议，他们就要退出会议。
    为了避免会议完全垮台，英国代表团团长劳埃德在二十三日会议上说，他认为，除了重申他已经提出的把会议进程的逐字记录提交埃及政府的保证外，没有必要发表公报或采取任何正式行动。
    苏联代表团团长谢皮洛夫提出了以同埃及政府讨论两种方案——美国方案和印度方案——为基础的会议公报草案。
    法国代表团团长比诺说，既然已经一致同意不进行表决，所以不可能在公报方面取得一致意见。他说没有什么结论可以供公报记录下来。
    新西兰代表在会上宣读了一项“意图声明”，宣布支持杜勒斯方案的十七个政府已经要求澳大利亚、埃塞俄比亚、伊朗、瑞典和美国的代表们，以澳大利亚总理孟席斯为主席，同埃及政府接触，解释杜勒斯方案的目的和目标，并且探明埃及是否同意在这种基础上进行谈判。
    谢皮洛夫竭力反对提出单方面的意见。
    梅农说，新西兰现在的声明同先前他的声明有所不同。他并不反对新西兰现在的声明，因为这仅仅是意图声明而不是提交会议的建议。不过梅农仍旧认为最好把杜勒斯方案和他的方案都向埃及提出。
    会议最后在一致同意把会议进程的逐字记录送交埃及的动议以后宣告结束。
