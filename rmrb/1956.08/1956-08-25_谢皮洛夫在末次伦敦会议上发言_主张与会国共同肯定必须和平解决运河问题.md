Xinhua News Agency, London, August 24th: TASS reports that the Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke at the London conference on the Suez Canal issue on August 23rd, opposing the New Zealand proposal to submit the "Dulles Plan" to Egypt alone in the form of an ultimatum, and advocated issuing a final communique reflecting the positive aspects of the conference.

Shepilov said that the task of the London conference should be to clarify the positions of the participants on the basis of a broad and free exchange of views, and to strive to find a basis for coordinating various viewpoints. However, now we are encountering a proposal that divides the conference into two parts without seeking compromise, which seeks to finalize the views expressed in the "Dulles Plan" while completely ignoring the plan submitted to the conference by India.

Judging from the entire process of the conference, and from the procedures adopted at the beginning of the conference, it should be considered reasonable to submit the plans put forward at the meeting, as well as various amendments and opinions on the plans, to Egypt after exchanging views on the substance of the Suez Canal issue. It is also reasonable to show due respect to any opinions expressed at the meeting, even if they do not represent the majority, and there should be no discrimination. However, the New Zealand representative's proposal to only convey the opinions of some participants in the conference to Egypt grossly violates this democratic principle.

Shepilov pointed out that the chairman, Lloyd, had said that the entire record of the London conference should also be handed over to Egypt so that Egypt could understand the opinions expressed by other countries at the meeting, such as India's opinion. However, since the entire record of the conference is to be handed over to Egypt, the practice of singling out the opinions of a part of the participating countries as the only possible basis for negotiation is even more untenable and undemocratic. It cannot be ignored that Mr. Lloyd's explanation only confirms that some people here want to discriminate against those participating countries who disagree with the American viewpoint.

Shepilov said: On our own part, we are not afraid to explain to Egypt, all relevant countries, and world public opinion that the "Dulles Plan" has been put forward at the meeting, but we fundamentally disagree with this plan because it is based on the principle of brutally violating Egypt's sovereignty. Why are the supporters of this plan afraid to publicly explain to Egypt, all relevant countries, and world public opinion the substance of the draft proposed by the representative of the Republic of India, and insist that there is only one "Dulles Plan"?

Shepilov pointed out that the "Dulles Plan" is only the opinion of a relatively small number of countries, and these countries cannot say that they alone are the expression of the opinions of the signatory countries of the 1888 Convention and the countries using the canal.

As for the New Zealand delegation's proposal, it is completely contrary to the task of guaranteeing effective negotiations with Egypt, which is of paramount importance at this stage. In essence, it is to force Egypt to accept one-sided, unfair demands that deny Egypt's sovereignty. It can be seen from this proposal that Egypt can only express whether it agrees to negotiate under the conditions proposed to it in the American plan. This tone is not the tone of consultation, but the tone of an ultimatum.

Shepilov said that it is still possible for the conference to promote the easing of international tensions, rather than sharpening them. The Soviet delegation believes that the positive aspects of the conference's work can be reflected in a brief final communique. This communique should tell world public opinion that the participating countries are striving to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue through negotiations on the basis of combining Egypt's national interests and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal.

Then Shepilov read out a draft of the communique.

The draft pointed out that the participants in the London conference unanimously agreed that the Suez Canal issue should be resolved entirely peacefully through consultation in strict compliance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Existing differences should be resolved on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and ensuring the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal in accordance with the principles of the October 29, 1888 Convention, and taking into account new circumstances and the spirit of the times. The communique also pointed out that the conference participants preliminarily discussed the plans proposed by the representatives of India, the United States, and Spain, as well as the views expressed by representatives of other countries during the discussion. They agreed that all these proposals and other materials from the meeting would be discussed with the Egyptian government in order to make it possible to formulate a draft agreement acceptable to all relevant countries during the negotiation process. The conference authorized the representatives of India, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to contact the Egyptian government for this purpose, discuss the above-mentioned materials with Egypt, and determine the necessary steps for the future.

Shepilov finally said that he did not insist on every word in this draft. As long as the main points of this communique are met with sympathy, a communique can be drafted whose wording can satisfy the participants of the conference and can be accepted by Egypt.

### 谢皮洛夫在末次伦敦会议上发言  主张与会国共同肯定必须和平解决运河问题

    谢皮洛夫在末次伦敦会议上发言
    主张与会国共同肯定必须和平解决运河问题
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫八月二十三日在讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议上发言，反对以最后通牒形式把“杜勒斯计划”单独提交埃及的新西兰建议，并且主张发表一项反映会议积极方面的最后公报。
    谢皮洛夫说，伦敦会议的任务应当是在广泛地、自由地交换意见的基础上弄清楚与会者的立场，并且争取求得协调各种看法的基础。但是，现在我们却遇到了把会议分裂成两部分而不谋求妥协的建议，它要使表达在“杜勒斯计划”中的看法成为定论，而完全忽视印度向会议提出的方案。
    从整个会议的工作进程来看，从会议一开始时所通过的程序来看，应当认为，在就苏彝士运河问题的实质交换意见以后，把会上所提出的方案以及对方案的各种修正和意见都提交给埃及，这是理所当然的。对会上的任何意见，即使它不代表多数，也应当表示应有的尊重，而不能有任何歧视，这也是理所当然的。但是新西兰代表关于只把会议一部分参加者的意见转达给埃及的建议粗暴地侵犯了这种民主的原则。
    谢皮洛夫指出，担任主席的劳埃德曾经说过，同时，还要把伦敦会议的全部纪录交给埃及，使埃及能够了解其他国家在会上所发表的意见，例如，印度的意见。但是，既然要把会议的全部纪录交给埃及，那末，把某一部分与会国的意见分出来作为谈判的唯一可能的基础的这种做法，就越发显得站不住脚，越发不民主了。不能不看到，劳埃德先生的解释仅仅证实了这里有人想歧视那些不同意美国观点的与会国。
    谢皮洛夫说：在我们自己方面，不怕对埃及、一切有关国家和世界公众说明，在会上曾经提出过“杜勒斯计划”，然而我们根本不同意这个计划，因为这个计划是以粗暴侵犯埃及主权的原则作为基础的。为什么这个计划的拥护者害怕对埃及、一切有关国家和世界公众公开说明印度共和国代表提出的草案的实质，而硬要说只有一个“杜勒斯计划”呢？
    谢皮洛夫指出，“杜勒斯计划”只是比较不多的一批国家的意见，这批国家不能够说只有它们才是1888年公约缔约国和使用运河的各国意见的表达者。
    至于新西兰代表团的建议，它是完全违背在现阶段具有头等意义的、保证同埃及举行有效谈判的任务的。它实质上是要强迫埃及接受片面的、不公平的和否认埃及主权的要求。从这个建议中可以看出，埃及只能表示它是否同意在美国计划向它提出的条件下进行谈判。这种语调不是协商的语调，而是最后通牒的语调。
    谢皮洛夫说，现在还有可能使会议能够促使国际紧张局势的缓和，而不是使这种局势尖锐起来。苏联代表团认为，可以把这个会议的工作的积极方面反映在一个简短的最后公报中。这个公报应当告诉世界舆论：与会国力求在埃及的民族利益和保证苏彝士运河通航自由的利益结合的基础上通过谈判的方式和平解决苏彝士运河问题。
    接着谢皮洛夫宣读了公报的草案。
    这个草案指出，伦敦会议的参加者一致认为，苏彝士运河问题应当完全用和平方式在严格遵守联合国宪章原则的情况下协商解决。应当在尊重埃及主权和按照1888年10月29日公约的原则，并且考虑到新情况和时代精神下保证苏彝士运河通航自由的基础上解决现有分歧。公报还指出，会议参加者初步讨论了印度、美国、西班牙的代表提出的方案以及其他国家代表在讨论过程中表示的见解。他们商定，所有这些建议和会议的其他材料都将同埃及政府商讨，以便有可能在谈判过程中制定出可以为一切有关国家接受的协定草案。会议授权印度、英国、法国、美国和苏联的代表为此目的同埃及政府接触，同埃及一起讨论上述材料，确定今后必要的步骤。
    谢皮洛夫最后说，他并不坚持这个草案中的每一句话。只要这个公报的主张得到同情，就可以拟定一个其措词能满足会议参加者并且可以被埃及接受的公报。
