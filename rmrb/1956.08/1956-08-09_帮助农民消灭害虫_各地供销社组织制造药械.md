    Helping Farmers Eliminate Pests
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Regions Organize the Manufacture of Pesticide Machinery

    (Our Dispatch) In addition to supplying a large number of factory-made pesticide machinery this year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also widely absorbed farmers' experiences, brought into play the creativity of the masses, and organized handicraft industry and agricultural cooperatives to manufacture a large number of locally-made pesticide machinery based on the principle of "obtaining materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally."
    The "earth airplane" (sedan-style cloth bag duster) created by farmers in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, is not only widely used in Shaanxi, but also promoted in Anhui, Henan, Hebei, Hunan and other places.
    The cadres of the Yuepu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, helped farmers create a bamboo tube sprayer. This kind of sprayer, in addition to using various copper, iron, and rubber waste materials for a few parts, is mainly made of Mao bamboo and Nan bamboo, which can save a lot of copper materials. Recently, the Baoshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also helped farmers modify single-tube sprayers into double-tube sprayers using bamboo poles, which doubled the efficiency compared with the original.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Yulin, Yongning, Binyang and other counties in Guangxi Province also equipped each agricultural cooperative with a rice stem borer egg remover comb. Yongning County alone promoted more than 1,000 of these. Using this egg remover comb, each person can remove eggs from about 30 mu per day, with an egg removal efficiency of over 90%, which has a great effect on suppressing the occurrence of stem borers.
    These locally-made pesticide machinery generally have the advantages of high efficiency, low price, convenient use, and easy manufacture, so they are very popular among farmers.

    帮助农民消灭害虫
    各地供销社组织制造药械
    本报讯　今年各地供销社除已供应了大批工厂制造的农药器械以外，还广泛吸收农民的经验，发挥群众的创造性，根据“就地取材，就地加工，就地供应”的原则组织手工业和农业社制造了大批土药械。
    陕西长安县农民创造的“土飞机”（轿式布袋洒粉器），不仅在陕西普遍使用，而且还推广到安徽、河南、河北、湖南等地。
    江苏省宝山县月浦区供销社干部帮助农民创造了竹筒式喷雾器。这种喷雾器，除少数零件利用各种铜、铁、橡皮废料外，主要组成部分都是用毛竹和南竹制成，可以节省大量铜料。最近宝山县供销社还帮助农民利用竹杆改装单管喷雾器为双管喷雾器，较原来的效率提高了一倍。
    广西省玉林、邕宁、宾阳等县供销社给每个农业社还配制了一架水稻螟虫除卵梳、仅邕宁一县就推广了一千余架，运用这种除卵梳每天每人能除卵三十亩左右，除卵效率达90％以上，对抑制螟虫发生有很大作用。
    这些土药械一般都具有效率高、价钱低、使用方便、容易制造的优点、所以很受农民欢迎。
