    Night Farewell to the Mine
    Zhao Guangmin
    The whistle startled the classmates from their sleep. Everyone immediately got up and packed their luggage. I went outside and looked at the sky; there were only a few sparse stars, and everything around was quiet. But the mine wasn't asleep. At this moment, the night shift miners were working underground, perhaps they had already drilled the holes and were preparing to set off the explosives.
    I remember when we arrived at the mine, it was a lively evening, with people busily coming and going on the construction site; now, we are leaving at a quiet midnight, as if someone intentionally wants us not to forget the mine's enchanting night.
    In the orderly and silent dormitory area, the mine's mothers and children are sleeping sweetly. The cool night breeze rustles the leaves on the tree-lined avenue; the high arched bridge is a good place for people to look out, but unfortunately, the beautiful scenery of the mine is hidden in the night. Wide mine avenue, you have once again left our footprints. We are passing through the mine gate again, the lights are bright, and the guards protecting the mine stand solemnly at the entrance. These days, we have passed in and out of here so many times, and the soldiers always looked at us with a smile; now they are watching us leave the mine again.
    The towering headframe, in the mine that never sleeps, is diligently working as usual. We have walked across the mine's sky bridge, up and down the cages, so many times; now we bid farewell to these.
    The mine gradually disappears behind us. People are increasingly reluctant to leave it, like a child leaving its mother, so hard to part with. Several girls, after walking a few steps, turn back to look in the direction of the mine: "Oh, I really can't bear to leave this place!" Enchanting coal mine, you are the home where we will live and work for a lifetime.
    In this short twenty-day internship, we, a group of students from the Beijing Mining Institute, have learned a lot here. We toured the underground city without day or night, visited the bustling and prosperous underground factory, learned how to drill holes, how to set off explosives, how to push carts, how to build supports, how to excavate, and how to open roadways… We have mastered the weapons to subdue the rocks. Heroic miners, our dear masters, how much labor knowledge you have taught us, how warm a friendship you have given us!
    The station arrived, and we boarded the train. The train started, and many of us were still leaning on the windows, gazing for a long time at the mine that was gradually receding into the distance. …

    夜别矿山
    赵光民
    哨声把同学们从睡梦中惊醒了。大伙马上起床打行李。我走到室外看了看天，只有几颗稀疏的星星，四周寂静无声。但矿山并没有睡，此刻，夜班的矿工们正在井下劳动着，也许他们已经打好了眼，正准备放炮呢。
    记得来到矿山的时候，是一个热闹的傍晚，工地上来往着奔忙的人们；现在离开的时候却是安静的子夜，这好像是谁有意不要我们忘记这矿山迷人的夜晚。
    在整齐寂静的工房区，矿山里的母亲和孩子们正在甜蜜的睡着。林荫大道上清凉的夜风吹得树叶沙沙作响；那高高的拱桥，是人们眺望的好地方，可惜这矿山美景，此时都隐藏在夜幕里了。宽阔的矿山大道呀，你又一次地留下了我们的脚印。我们又经过矿区的大门了，电灯通亮，保卫矿山的警卫战士肃立在门口，这些日子我们多少次从这儿出出进进，战士们总是微笑地望着我们；现在他们又目送我们走出矿山。
    高耸的井架，在不夜的矿山里，照例辛勤地工作着。我们多少次走过矿山的天桥，上下罐笼，现在我们向这些告别。
    矿山渐渐在我们背后消逝了。人们越走越留恋它，好像孩儿离娘的那种心情，是那样难舍难分。几位姑娘，走不几步就回头向矿山方向望望：“哎呀，我真舍不得这个地方！”迷人的煤矿呀，你是我们一辈子生活劳动的家乡。
    在这短短二十天的实习生活里，我们这群北京矿业学院的学生，在这儿学了不少东西。游历了没有昼夜的地下城市，参观了热闹繁荣的地下工厂，怎样打眼，怎样放炮，怎样推车，怎样支架，怎样掘进，又怎样开巷道……掌握了降伏岩石的武器。英雄的矿工，我们亲爱的师傅，教给了我们多少劳动知识，给我们多么温暖的友谊啊！
    车站到了，我们登上了列车。列车开行了，我们许多人还伏在窗口上，久久地望着渐渐远去的矿山。……
