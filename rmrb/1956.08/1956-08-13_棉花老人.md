    Old Man Cotton
    Su Jinshan
    There's a legend in the countryside,
    About an old man cotton who lives west of the river,
    People say he's an expert at growing cotton,
    But he says he's just herding sheep.
    When he goes to the fields,
    The cotton plants all over,
    Are like sheep,
    Rolling around him.
    He strokes them,
    And talks to them;
    He knows completely
    Their warmth, cold, and temperament.
    Many sheep,
    Form a large flock,
    And the cotton blooms more and more,
    Turning into white clouds in the sky.
    He stands at the edge of the field and looks,
    White clouds surge towards him,
    And his disciples,
    Each rides a white cloud.
    Actually, there's nothing rare about this legend,
    It's all the old man's own personal experience,
    What's rare is his hands,
    His hands Chairman Mao has shaken three times.

    棉花老人
    苏金伞
    乡下有个传说，
    说河西住着一个棉花老人，
    人家都说他是植棉能手，
    他自己却说是在放牧羊群。
    他一到地里，
    那满地的棉花，
    就像绵羊一样，
    在他身边打滚。
    他抚摸着它们，
    和它们谈心；
    他完全熟悉
    他们的冷暖和性情。
    许多绵羊，
    合成大群，
    而棉花也越开越多，
    变成满天的白云。
    他站在地头一望，
    白云舒卷着向他奔涌，
    而他的弟子们，
    每人都驾着一片白云。
    其实这传说并没什么稀罕，
    这都是老人自己亲身的体验，
    稀罕的倒是他的双手，
    他的手毛主席曾经握过三遍。
