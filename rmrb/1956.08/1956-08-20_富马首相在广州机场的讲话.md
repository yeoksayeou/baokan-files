Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's Speech at Guangzhou Airport

Governor, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    All the members of the Lao delegation and I myself feel extremely delighted to set foot on the land of the People's Republic of China for the first time.

    At the beginning of our visit, I would like to express the friendship of the Royal Government and the Lao people to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. I especially extend the friendly greetings of the Lao delegation to the city of Guangzhou.

    We are going to Beijing at the kind invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. Our visit is mainly a goodwill visit, a visit from neighbor to neighbor. As you know, Laos, which pursues a neutral policy, is willing to live in harmony and peace with all its neighbors on the basis of mutual respect.

    Therefore, in order to understand each other and for us to understand your great and beautiful country, it is normal for us and China to resume contact. China and Laos have maintained friendly relations in the past, and we are now simply restoring an old tradition.

    I believe that for the sake of the most precious peace, our delegation's visit will promote a better understanding between our two countries and will be conducive to the development of friendly relations between the two countries.

    On behalf of the Lao delegation, I would like to thank you for your warm welcome, which symbolizes how honored our visit is.

    富马首相在广州机场的讲话省长先生，女士们，先生们：
    老挝代表团全体团员和我自己为我们第一次踏上中华人民共和国的土地而感到极大的愉快。
    在我们访问的开始，我愿向中华人民共和国政府和中国人民表达王国政府和老挝人民的友情。我特别向广州市致以老挝代表团的友好敬意。
    我们是应中华人民共和国政府盛意邀请而去北京的。我们的访问主要是亲善的访问，是邻国对邻国的访问。正像你们所了解的，奉行中立政策的老挝愿意在相互尊重的基础上同一切邻国融洽地和平相处。
    因此，为了互相了解并为了使我们了解你们伟大而美丽的国家，我们和中国恢复了接触是正常的。中国和老挝过去就保持过友好的关系，我们现在只不过是恢复一个旧有的传统。
    我相信，为了最珍贵的和平，我们代表团的访问将促使我们两国之间更好的了解，并将有利于两国之间友好关系的发展。
    我谨代表老挝代表团向你们如此热忱的欢迎表示感谢，这种热忱的欢迎象征着我们的访问是多么荣幸。
