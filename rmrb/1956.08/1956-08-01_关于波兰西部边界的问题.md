    On the Question of Poland's Western Border

    Recently, during his visit to Poland, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, made a statement regarding the issue of the Silesian border. This statement said that Poland's western border and Silesia now belong to Poland forever (see page 6 of this newspaper on July 28th). Some readers are not very familiar with this issue and have requested further explanation from this newspaper. We now provide a brief reply as follows:

    Poland's western neighbor is the German Democratic Republic. The border between these two countries is the Oder-Neisse line. The area east of the Oder-Neisse line is Poland's western border. The area east of the western section of the Neisse River and the upper reaches of the Oder River is collectively known as Silesia. It includes the current Polish provinces of Stalinogród, Opole, Wrocław, and Zielona Góra. Silesia is an important industrial region in Poland and one of the largest coal-producing areas in Europe. The industrial output of this region is almost 27% of Poland's total industrial output, and one-third of Poland's industrial workers work in this region.

    How did the question of Poland's western border and Silesia arise? Originally, this area had belonged to the Polish people since ancient times. As early as the tenth century, the entire Silesia had become a province of Poland. However, in the 1740s, most of Silesia was occupied by Prussia. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, the people of Silesia launched a widespread movement demanding reunification with Poland. However, because the Polish bourgeois-landlord ruling class, which betrayed national interests at the time, did not support the people's struggle, only a part of Silesia, namely Upper Silesia, was returned to Poland. After the German fascists invaded Poland in September 1939, the entire Silesia, along with Polish territory, was forcibly occupied by Hitler.

    After the defeat of fascist Germany and the liberation of Poland in 1945, the Polish people recovered their original lost territories. At the same time, Poland's new territories were discussed and recognized in international conferences and documents. For example, the declaration of the Crimea Conference of the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom held in February 1945 stated: "They recognize that Poland must receive large territorial concessions in the north and west." In August of the same year, the Potsdam Agreement signed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom made the provisions for the division of Poland's western border even clearer. The agreement stated: "The leaders of the three governments agree that, pending the final determination of Poland's western border, the former German territory, i.e., from the Baltic Sea west of Swinemünde, along the Oder River to its confluence with the western section of the Neisse River, then along the western section of the Neisse River to the border with Czechoslovakia, east of the border line, including East Prussia, which was decided by this conference not to be under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, and including the area of the former Free City of Danzig, should be administered by the Polish government, and for this purpose, should not be regarded as part of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany."

    In order to confirm the border between the two countries, the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic issued a joint declaration in July 1950, announcing that the Oder-Neisse line was the border between Poland and Germany. On January 27, 1951, delegations from the two governments signed an agreement in Frankfurt an der Oder, solemnly reaffirming the border between the two countries, which had already become a reality after the war.

    All peace-loving countries and peoples regard the Oder-Neisse line as a boundary of peace between Poland and Germany, and believe that it conforms to historical reality and the interests of the Polish and German people. However, ill-intentioned Western countries and the West German Adenauer group are still attempting to deny the Polish people's right to recover their lost territories and unify their country. They vainly hope that the map of Poland will change color again one day. This can only prove that they are closing their eyes to the facts and intentionally obliterating the provisions of the solemn international agreements they themselves signed.

    This time, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, made a statement on the Polish border issue during his visit to the Stalinogród Province of Poland, which was a heavy blow to those imperialists who attempted to provoke friendly relations between the Polish and German people, and also a demonstration of the consolidated friendship between the countries of the socialist camp. As Bulganin said in his statement: "Justice has prevailed... No one can hinder this just act. The western border and Silesia now belong to Poland forever." (Jing)

### 关于波兰西部边界的问题

    关于波兰西部边界的问题
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁最近在访问波兰的时候，曾发表了一个关于西里西亚边界问题的声明。这个声明说，波兰的西部边界和西里西亚现在已经永远属于波兰（见七月二十八日本报第六版）。有些读者对这个问题不很了解，要求本报作进一步的解释，现在我们简复如下：
    波兰的西邻是德意志民主共和国。这两个国家是以尼斯河和奥得河为国界的。在尼斯河和奥得河以东的一带地方就是波兰的西部边界。而尼斯河西段以东和奥得河上游的地带则统称为西里西亚。它包括现在波兰的斯大林诺格罗德、奥波尔、弗罗茨拉夫和兹辽纳古尔等省。西里西亚是波兰重要的工业区，也是欧洲最大的煤产区之一。这个区域的工业产值几乎等于波兰全国工业总产值的27％，波兰三分之一的工业工人都在这个区域工作。
    关于波兰的西部边界和西里西亚的问题是如何产生的呢？原来这一带地方自古以来就是属于波兰人民的。早在十世纪的时候，整个西里西亚就已成为波兰的一个省份。但到十八世纪四十年代，西里西亚的大部分土地却被普鲁士占领了。1918年波兰重新立国之后，西里西亚人民曾广泛展开要求重新合并于波兰的运动，但是由于当时出卖民族利益的波兰资产阶级—地主统治阶级不支持人民的斗争，所以结果只有西里西亚的一部分，即上西里西亚还给了波兰。1939年9月德国法西斯侵略波兰以后，整个西里西亚便和波兰国土一起遭到希特勒的强占。
    1945年法西斯德国战败，波兰全国解放以后，波兰人民又收复了原来的失地。同时在国际会议和国际文件中也对波兰的新的疆土作了讨论和承认。如1945年2月举行的苏、美、英三国领袖克里米亚会议声明中说：“他们承认：波兰必须在北方和西方获得广大的领土上的让予。”同年八月，苏、美、英三国签订的波茨坦协定，对于波兰西部边界的划分问题规定得更加明确了。协定中说：“三国政府领袖同意，在波兰西部边界最后划定前，以前德国之领土，即自斯维内蒙德以西之波罗的海，沿奥得河至与尼斯河西段会流处，再沿尼斯河西段至捷克斯洛伐克边境线以东，包括经本会议决定不归苏联管辖之东普鲁士，并包括以前之但泽自由市区域，应由波兰政府管辖，且为达到此种目的，应不得视为苏联在德占领区之一部分。”
    为了确认两国的国界，波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国曾在1950年7月发表联合宣言，宣告以奥得河—尼斯河为波、德两国的国界。1951年1月27日，两国政府代表团又在奥得河畔的法兰克福城签订了一个协定，重新庄严地肯定了已经在战后成为事实的两国国界。
    一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都把奥得河—尼斯河看成是波、德两国之间的和平的界限，并且认为这是符合于历史的现实，符合于波兰人民和德国人民的利益的。但是别有用心的西方国家和西德阿登纳集团却仍然企图否认波兰人民收复自己失土和统一自己国家的权利。他们妄想有朝一日使波兰地图再次变色。这只能证明他们闭眼不看事实和有意抹煞有他们自己签字的庄严国际协定的规定。
    这次苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在访问波兰斯大林诺格罗德省时所发表的关于波兰边界问题的声明，对于那些企图挑拨波、德人民友好关系的帝国主义分子，是一次沉重的打击，也是社会主义阵营各国巩固的友谊的表现。正如布尔加宁在声明中所说的：“正义获得了胜利……谁也不能够妨碍这个正义的行为。西部边界和西里西亚现在已经永远属于波兰。”　（竞）
