Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th. Tass reported on the 6th that according to the "Al-Ahram" newspaper, a spokesman for the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour said that the former Suez Canal Company discriminated against Egyptian employees in their work, giving foreigners a privileged position. Foreigners doing the same work as Egyptians were paid higher wages. Their living conditions were better than those of the Egyptians. Foreigners enjoyed privileges in medical care and social welfare.

The spokesman said that these actions of the former Suez Canal Company were contrary to the national sovereignty of Egypt. This company used to be a state within a state. The canal management authorities often violated Egyptian laws in the past and disregarded Egyptian labour laws.

The spokesman went on to say that in 1955, the Egyptian government established a committee to examine the working conditions of Egyptian workers and eliminate discrimination against Egyptians, but this committee was obstructed in every possible way by the company authorities in its work.

The spokesman said that materials and documents concerning the former Suez Canal Company's violation of Egyptian laws have been submitted to the Suez Canal Authority.

    前苏彝士运河公司歧视埃及职工
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社开罗六日讯：“金字塔报”报道，据社会事务与劳工部发言人说，前苏彝士运河公司在工作中歧视埃及职工，使外国人处于特权地位。外国人同埃及人做同样的工作，所得工资却比较高。他们的居住条件比埃及人好。外国人在医疗和社会福利方面享有特权。
    发言人说，前苏彝士运河公司的这些行为是同埃及的国家主权相抵触的。这家公司曾经是国家中的国家。运河管理当局过去经常破坏埃及的法律，不理会埃及的劳动法。
    发言人接着说，1955年，埃及政府建立了一个委员会来检查埃及工人的劳动条件，消除对埃及人的歧视，然而这个委员会在工作中却遭到公司当局千方百计的阻碍。
    发言人说，关于前苏彝士运河公司破坏埃及法律的材料和文件已经送交苏彝士运河管理委员会。
