Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, August 13th: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser announced at a press conference on August 12th that the Egyptian government opposes international control of the Suez Canal, that Egypt will not participate in the London Twenty-Four Nation Conference, and that it does not recognize this conference as an international conference with the right to make decisions. The Egyptian government suggests convening a conference including the signatory countries of the Constantinople Convention and all countries that use the Suez Canal to re-examine this convention signed in 1888.

More than three hundred Egyptian and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

The Egyptian government's statement read by Abdel Nasser at the press conference is as follows:

On July 26th, the Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and promulgated a special law in accordance with this situation. According to this law, canal shareholders can receive compensation based on the Paris stock market price on the day before nationalization.

On the same day, a specialized agency managing the canal, which is completely independent and has a separate budget, took over the management of the canal. This new management agency possesses all necessary powers and is not restricted by government laws and regulations.

On August 3rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a note from the British Embassy in Cairo, containing the full text of the statement issued by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France regarding Egypt's nationalization of the canal company.

In addition to this statement, the Egyptian government received an invitation to attend a conference to be held in London on August 16, 1956.

The Egyptian government cannot agree with the content of the statement by the Western Three Foreign Ministers regarding the Suez Canal Company because this statement attempts to apply all possible means to give the Suez Canal Company a status that it does not possess. The purpose is solely to create reasons conducive to interfering in some issues considered to be Egyptian sovereign affairs.

(1) The first section of the statement says that the Suez Canal Company "has always had an international nature." The Egyptian government regrets to say that this is completely unfounded. The Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian limited company whose lease was granted by the Egyptian government for a term of ninety-nine years.

Article 16 of the contract between the Egyptian government and the Suez Canal Company, reached in 1866, states, "The International Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian company, governed by Egyptian laws and customs." In addition, the British government itself also recognized this fact and defended this opinion in the Egyptian mixed courts.

In 1939, the British government, through its representative, stated in a mandate submitted to the Mixed Supreme Court in Alexandria, "The Suez Canal Company is a legal person recognized by Egyptian law, and its nationality and nature are entirely Egyptian; therefore, it is certainly governed by Egyptian law."

Indeed, the company is named the International Suez Canal Company. However, this name has no legal significance and cannot obtain legal effect solely from the company's name. Without a doubt, this name cannot deprive the company of its Egyptian nationality. According to recognized general legal principles, especially according to the principles of international private law and the company's organizational law, this company is Egyptian. It is Egyptian because the object of its concession is Egyptian public property and because its main legal center is in Egypt. It cannot be both Egyptian and not Egyptian at the same time, or both an Egyptian and an international company at the same time, because this violates legal principles.

(2) The same section of the statement says, "In 1888, all major powers, which at that time were mainly concerned with the international nature of the canal and its free, open, and safe use without discrimination, jointly concluded the Treaty and Convention of Constantinople. This stipulated, for the benefit of the whole world, that the international nature of the canal would continue permanently, regardless of whether the privilege period of the International Suez Canal Company expired or not."

The Egyptian government regrets noting that the statement by the Three Foreign Ministers distorted the facts and attempted once again to give the canal an international nature.

The 1888 Convention is about guaranteeing the free use of the Suez Canal. In its preamble, it states that the purpose of the Convention is to establish a clear system aimed at guaranteeing the free use of the canal by all countries. Article 1 states: "The Suez Maritime Canal shall be free and open, in time of war as in time of peace, to every vessel of commerce or of war, without distinction of flag."

Article 13 of the 1888 Convention states that, apart from the obligations explicitly stipulated in the provisions of this Convention, this Convention in no way prejudices the sovereignty of the Egyptian government.

Article 14 clearly shows that the 1888 Convention has nothing to do with the Suez Canal Company. This article states: "The High Contracting Parties agree that the engagements resulting from the present Treaty shall not be limited by the duration of the Acts of Concession of the International Suez Canal Company."

Everyone knows that the company's lease will expire in twelve years, and the Egyptian government will take over the company's management and operation.

(3) The Egyptian government also regrets that the statement issued by the Three Foreign Ministers mentioned some facts while deliberately omitting other facts proving Egypt's rights. This is further proof of an attempt to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs.

The first section of the statement says that, according to the agreement concluded between Egypt and the United Kingdom in 1954, Egypt recognized in Article 8 that the Suez Canal is "a waterway of international importance from the economic, commercial and strategic point of view."

The same statement omits the first part of Article 8, which clearly states that the canal is an indivisible part of Egypt.

The governments of the three countries acknowledged in the second section of the statement that Egypt enjoys and exercises all the powers of a fully autonomous and independent state to nationalize its property. However, they doubt Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal of Egypt, insisting: "It involves the arbitrary and unilateral seizure by one country of an international agency, which is responsible for maintaining and managing the Suez Canal, so that all signatory and beneficiary countries of the 1888 Convention can effectively enjoy the right to use an international waterway (the economy, trade and security of many countries in the world depend on this waterway)."

Obviously, the governments of the three countries that issued the joint statement insisted that the Suez Canal Company is an international agency and that the Egyptian government cannot change its nature.

This disregards all treaties and agreements that consider the Suez Canal Company to be an Egyptian company governed by Egyptian law and disregards the fact that when the Suez Canal Company's agreement expires, the Egyptian government will take over the canal.

This also disregards the fact that the canal is an indivisible part of Egypt.

Whether the canal is managed by the company or the Egyptian government, the 1888 Convention will remain in effect, which proves that the Three Nations' statement is distorting the facts in order to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. There is no legal basis to indicate that an Egyptian company governed by Egyptian law is also an international agency entrusted with guaranteeing the navigation of the canal.

Therefore, the nationalization of the canal company is a decision made by the Egyptian government according to its sovereignty, and any attempt to give the Suez Canal Company an international nature is only an excuse to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs.

(4) The third section of the statement says: "The actions taken by the Egyptian government, taking into account all the accompanying circumstances, pose a threat to the free and safe navigation of the canal guaranteed by the 1888 Convention." This statement is completely unfounded because there is no relationship between the Suez Canal Company and the 1888 Convention on the freedom of navigation of the canal.

Article 14 of this Convention states: "The High Contracting Parties agree that the engagements resulting from the present Treaty shall not be limited by the duration of the Acts of Concession of the International Suez Canal Company."

Any attempt to link the Suez Canal Company with the freedom of navigation of the canal will only arouse suspicion because the Suez Canal Company has never been responsible for the freedom of navigation of the canal. It is the 1888 Convention that stipulates the freedom of navigation of the canal. The Egyptian government supervises this freedom in this capacity: the canal is on its territory and is an indivisible part of its entire territory.

The well-known fact is that Egypt has never violated any of its international obligations, and it cannot be believed that any company, no matter what kind of company it is, can be responsible for guaranteeing the freedom and safety of navigation of the Suez Canal.

Confusing the Suez Canal Company with the freedom of navigation is only further proof of a deliberate attempt to create excuses for interfering in Egypt's internal affairs and sovereignty.

(5) The fourth section of the Three Governments' statement says: "They believe that steps should be taken, in line with Egypt's legitimate interests, to establish an operating arrangement under an international system, the purpose of which is to guarantee the continuity of the canal's operations as guaranteed by the Convention of October 29, 1888."

This section clearly shows why the governments that issued the Three Nations' statement are trying to give the Suez Canal Company an international nature, regardless of any conventions and laws.

This statement is entirely used to deny Egypt's recognized rights and deprive Egypt of its sovereignty over the Suez Canal, which is considered an indivisible part of it.

The 1888 Convention itself clearly indicates that the provisions of the Convention remain in effect, whether during the lease period or after the expiration of the lease right and after the management right of the canal is transferred to the Egyptian government.

The Egyptian government believes that establishing an international organization is nothing but a gentle method that should be called collective colonialism.

This suggestion to give this Egyptian company an international nature, based on this deceptive statement, clearly shows that the governments of the three countries that issued the Three Nations' statement want to deprive Egypt of an inherent and sovereign right.

(6) The suggestion, presented to the Egyptian government on behalf of these three countries, to establish an international management agency for the Suez Canal, intends to delegate the authority to operate the canal, guarantee freedom of navigation, and arrange fair compensation for the Suez Canal Company to this proposed company.

This suggestion shows that the purpose of the London Conference is to openly interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, and no conference has the right to do so.

(7) Accompanying the Three Nations' statement is a planned conspiracy to plunge the Egyptian people into hunger and terror. The three countries that issued this statement have frozen Egypt's property and funds in their banks.

They are doing this in violation of international agreements and the United Nations Charter, and these measures are intended to exert economic pressure on the Egyptian people. The country that built this canal lost 120,000 of its sons and bore almost all the necessary expenses for digging this canal.

Britain and France have formally announced the mobilization of their reservists and are mobilizing troops and navies.

The Egyptian government most strongly condemns these measures. These measures are a threat to the Egyptian people, attempting to force them to hand over a part of their territory and sovereignty to an international organization, which is actually collective colonialism. The measures taken by the British and French governments are a threat to world peace and security. This is a violation of the United Nations Charter, which both countries have guaranteed to respect.

These measures threaten all small countries and are condemned not only in Egypt but also in all free countries, and also by the people of all countries that have freed themselves from colonial rule and are striving to maintain their hard-won independence and sovereignty.

(8) When announcing the decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, the Egyptian government reiterated its determination to guarantee the freedom of navigation of this canal. Nationalization does not affect the freedom of navigation through this waterway at all. The fact that 766 ships have passed through the canal in the past two weeks is clear proof of this.

(9) Regarding the invitation to attend the conference, Egypt is very surprised to note that the United Kingdom has issued an invitation to hold a conference to discuss the Suez Canal, which constitutes an indivisible part of Egypt, without consulting directly related Egypt. The British government limited the countries participating in this conference to only twenty-four, despite the fact that no fewer than forty-five countries used this canal in 1955.

(10) Therefore, the Egyptian government cannot consider this proposed conference, including all its accompanying circumstances, to be an international conference qualified to make decisions.

Furthermore, this conference has no right to discuss issues within Egypt's jurisdiction or related to sovereignty over any part of its territory. Therefore, Egypt cannot accept the invitation to attend such a conference.

(11) However, determined to strive to maintain international peace and faithful to the United Nations Charter and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference stipulating the peaceful settlement of international problems, the Egyptian government is willing to initiate a conference together with the governments of other signatory countries of the 1888 Constantinople Convention, to which other governments whose ships pass through the Suez Canal should be invited, in order to review the Constantinople Convention and consider the conclusion of an agreement by all these countries to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal. This agreement will be registered with the United Nations Secretariat and published by the Secretariat, and this agreement will be open to other governments applying to join at any time.

    纳赛尔总统在记者招待会上宣读埃及政府声明
    埃及反对国际管制苏彝士运河
    决定不参加伦敦会议并且指出会议无权作出任何决定
    建议召开广泛性的会议达成保证运河航行自由的协定
    新华社13日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔八月十二日在记者招待会上宣布，埃及政府反对国际管制苏彝士运河，埃及不参加伦敦二十四国会议，并且不承认这个会议是有权作出决定的国际会议。埃及政府建议召开一个包括有君士坦丁堡公约签字国和所有利用苏彝士运河的国家参加的会议，来重新审查这个在1888年签订的公约。
    有三百多个埃及和外国记者出席了这个招待会。
    阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在记者招待会上宣读的埃及政府的声明如下：
    七月二十六日，埃及政府宣布将苏彝士运河公司收归国有，并且按照这种情况颁布了一项特别法律。根据这项法律，运河股东可以按照在收归国有前一天的巴黎股票市场价格得到赔偿。
    同一天，完全独立的、有单独预算的一个管理运河的专门机构接管了对运河的管理，这个新的管理机构拥有一切必要权力，不受政府的法律和条例的限制。
    八月三日，外交部收到了英国驻开罗大使馆送来的英国政府的一件照会，照会中有美国、联合王国和法国政府就埃及把运河公司收归国有发表的声明全文。
    除了这项声明以外，埃及政府收到了请它参加1956年8月16日在伦敦举行的会议的邀请。
    埃及政府不能同意西方三国外交部长关于苏彝士运河公司的声明的内容，因为这项声明企图运用一切可能办法加给苏彝士运河公司一种它并不具有的地位，其目的完全是为了制造有助于干预被认为是埃及主权事务的一些问题的理由。
    （一）声明的第一节说，苏彝士运河公司“始终具有国际性质”。埃及政府遗憾地说，这是完全没有根据的。苏彝士运河公司是一个埃及的有限公司，它的租借权是由埃及政府让出的，为期九十九年。
    1866年达成的埃及政府和苏彝士运河公司的合同第十六条说，“国际苏彝士运河公司是埃及公司，受埃及法律和习惯的管辖。”此外，英国政府本身也承认这个事实，并且在埃及的混合法庭上为这个意见作过辩护。
    英国政府1939年由它的代表向驻亚历山大港混合最高法庭提出的委托书中说，“苏彝士运河公司是得到埃及法律承认的法人，它的国籍和性质完全是埃及的，因此它肯定受埃及法律的管辖。”
    的确，这个公司是以国际苏彝士运河公司命名的。但是这个名称并没有法律意义，并且不能只从公司的名称来取得法律效果。毫无疑问，这个名称不能够剥夺这个公司的埃及国籍。根据公认的一般法律原则，特别是根据国际私法的原则和这个公司的组织法，这个公司是埃及的。它是埃及的，因为它所得到的租让权的对象是埃及的公共财产，因为它的法律上的主要中心是在埃及。它不能同时又是埃及的又不是埃及的，或者同时既是埃及的又是国际的公司，因为这是违反法律原则的。
    （二）这个声明中的同一节说，“在1888年，当时同运河的国际性质及其在无所歧视的情况下的自由、公开和安全的使用主要有关的所有大国共同缔结了君士坦丁堡条约和公约。这就为全世界的利益规定了运河的国际性质将永久继续下去，不管国际苏彝士运河公司的特权期满与否。”
    埃及政府遗憾地注意到，三国外交部长的声明歪曲了事实，再次企图给运河以国际性质。
    1888年公约是关于保障苏彝士运河的自由使用的。在它的序言中说，公约的目的是为了建立一个以保障所有国家自由使用运河为目的的明确的制度。第一条说：“苏彝士海上运河在战时同平时一样，应对所有不论悬挂何国国旗的商船或军舰自由开放。”
    1888年公约第十三条说，除了这个公约条款所明确规定的义务以外，这个公约丝毫不损害埃及政府的主权。
    公约第十四条清楚地表明，1888年公约同苏彝士运河公司毫无关系。这条条文说：“缔约各方同意根据本条约所产生的承诺不应受国际苏彝士运河公司的‘租让法案’期限的限制。”
    大家知道，公司的租借权将在十二年内到期，并且埃及政府将接替公司的管理和经营。
    （三）埃及政府还感到遗憾的是：三国外交部长发表的声明提到了一些事实，而故意略去其余的证明埃及的权利的事实。这是企图干涉埃及内政的又一明证。
    声明的第一节说，根据1954年埃及同英国缔结的协定，埃及在第八条中承认苏彝士运河是“一条在经济上、商业上和战略上具有国际性重要意义的水道”。
    同一声明略去了第八条的前一部分，这一部分明确地说，运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分。
    三国政府在声明的第二节中承认埃及享有和行使一个完全自主和独立的国家的一切权力来把它的财产收归国有。但是它们又怀疑埃及把埃及的苏彝士运河收归国有的权利，硬说：“它牵涉到由一个国家专横地、片面地夺取一个国际机构的问题，这个机构有责任维持和管理苏彝士运河，从而使1888年公约的所有签字国和受益国都可以有效地享受使用一个国际航道（世界上许多国家的经济、贸易和安全都依靠这个航道）的权利。”
    很明显，发表联合声明的三国政府坚持硬说苏彝士运河公司是一个国际机构，并且埃及政府不能改变它的性质。
    这就漠视了认为苏彝士运河公司是一个由埃及法律管辖的埃及公司的一切条约和协定，并且漠视了这个事实：当苏彝士运河公司协定期满的时候，埃及政府将接管运河。
    这也漠视了这个事实：运河是埃及的不可分割的一部分。
    不论运河由公司或者埃及政府来管理，1888年的公约将仍然存在，这就证明三国声明是为了干涉埃及内政而曲解事实。没有任何法律根据表明，一个受埃及法律管辖的埃及公司同时又是被委以保证运河的航行的国际机构。
    因此，把运河公司收归国有是埃及政府根据它的主权作出的一个决定，任何使苏彝士运河公司具有国际性质的企图都只是干涉埃及内政的借口。
    （四）声明的第三节说：“埃及政府所采取的行动在考虑到一切附随状况时对于1888年的公约所保证的运河自由航行和安全是一种威胁。”这种说法是完全没有根据的，因为苏彝士运河公司和关于运河航行自由的1888年公约之间没有任何关系。
    这个公约的第十四条说：“缔约各方同意根据本条约所产生的承诺不应受国际苏彝士运河公司的‘租让法案’期限的限制。”
    想把苏彝士运河公司同运河航行自由联系起来的任何企图只会引起怀疑，因为苏彝士运河公司从来都没有对运河航行自由负责。规定了运河航行自由的是1888年公约。埃及政府是以这样的资格来监督这种自由的：这条运河是在它的领土上，并且是它整个领土的不可分割的一部分。
    大家都知道的事实是：埃及从来没有违反它所负的任何国际义务，不能相信，任何公司，不论它是怎样的公司，能够对保证苏彝士运河的航行自由和安全负责。
    把苏彝士运河公司同航行自由混淆起来，只不过是进一步证明了蓄意要制造干涉埃及内政和主权的借口的企图。
    （五）三国政府声明的第四节说：“它们认为应该在符合埃及的合法利益的情况下采取步骤，建立在国际制度下的一种经营安排，其目的在于保证1888年10月29日的公约所保证的运河经营的连续性。”
    这一节清楚地表明了为什么发表三国声明的政府不顾一切公约和法律，设法使苏彝士运河公司具有国际性质。
    这个声明完全是用来否认埃及的公认的权利，剥夺埃及对于被认为是它的不可分割的一部分的苏彝士运河的主权。
    1888年公约本身明确地表明，不论是在租借期间或者是在租借权结束之后以及在运河的管理权移交给埃及政府之后，公约的规定是继续有效的。
    埃及政府认为，建立国际机构不是别的，而只是应该称为集体殖民主义的温和的手法。
    这个以迷惑人的声明为基础的给予这个埃及公司以国际性质的建议，清楚地表明，发表三国声明的三国政府想要剥夺埃及一项固有的和主权的权利。
    （六）代表这三个国家向埃及政府提出的建立苏彝士运河国际管理机构的建议，想要把经营运河，保证航行自由和安排苏彝士运河公司的公平赔偿的职权交给这个拟议中的公司。
    这种建议表明，伦敦会议的目的是公开干涉埃及的内政，而任何会议都没有权这样做的。
    （七）随同三国声明而来的是企图使埃及人民陷入饥饿和恐怖中的一个有计划的阴谋。发表这个声明的三个国家已经冻结了埃及在它们银行中的财产和资金。
    它们这样作是违反国际协定和联合国宪章的，这种措施是为了对埃及人民施加经济压力。建造这条运河的国家失去了它的十二万儿子，并且几乎负担了挖掘这条运河的全部必要费用。
    英国和法国正式宣布动员它们的后备兵员，并且调动军队和海军。
    埃及政府最强烈地谴责这些措施。这些措施是对埃及人民的一种威胁，企图迫使他们把自己的一部分领土和主权交出来给一个国际机构，这实际上就是集体殖民主义。英法两国政府采取这些措施是对世界和平和安全的威胁。这是违反它们两国都保证尊重的联合国宪章的。
    这些措施威胁到一切小国，对这些措施不只在埃及，而且在一切自由的国家中都受到谴责，而且也受到那些摆脱了殖民统治并且在努力保持他们得来不易的独立和主权的各国人民的谴责。
    （八）埃及政府在宣布决定把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的时候，曾经重申它要保证这条运河的航行自由的决心。国有化一点都不影响通过这条水道的航行自由。在过去两个星期中有七百六十六只船通过运河这个事实就是一个清楚的证明。
    （九）关于邀请参加会议这件事情，埃及十分惊奇地注意到：英国竟没有同直接有关的埃及商量，就发出邀请举行会议讨论构成埃及不可分割的一部分的苏彝士运河的问题。英国政府把参加这个会议的国家仅仅限于二十四个，尽管事实是在1955年内使用这条运河的不下于四十五个国家。
    （十）因此，埃及政府不能认为这个拟议中的会议，包括它所有附随情况在内，是一个有资格作出决定的国际会议。
    此外，这个会议也没有任何权利讨论在埃及管辖范围之内，或者有关在它的领土的任何部分之上的主权的问题。因此，埃及不能接受出席这种会议的邀请。
    （十一）但是，由于决心竭力维持国际和平，并且忠于联合国宪章和规定和平解决国际问题的万隆会议的决议，埃及政府愿意同1888年君士坦丁堡公约其他签字国政府一起，发起一个有船只通过苏彝士运河的其他政府均应被邀请参加的会议，以便审查君士坦丁堡公约，并且考虑由所有这些国家缔结一个协定来重新肯定和保证苏彝士运河航行自由。这个协定将向联合国秘书处登记，由秘书处公布，这个协定随时向其他申请参加的政府开放。
