    "June Cuckoo"
    Tian Guang
    I came to Guangfu Township, a key township of the Daishi District Committee in Fushun County, Sichuan, and participated in a symposium of members of an agricultural cooperative. At the meeting, the members excitedly talked about the great achievements made in production this year after the basic collectivization of the whole township. It could be seen that they were full of confidence in this year's agricultural production increase. However, at the end, everyone sighed in unison. Someone said, "Alas! If it weren't for those pigeons, this year's harvest would be even better!"
    "What? Is the bird damage here very serious?" My words immediately caused a burst of laughter. This sudden burst of laughter really baffled me. At my repeated requests, they finally revealed the "answer":
    Strangely enough, after collectivization, the leading organs here implemented a new method of "specific leadership." They uniformly formulated a production schedule for all farmers, ordering all the masses to march forward in step according to their "commands." The resident township staff became "supervisors" who monitored the masses to do things according to the schedule. They held the schedule, checking everyone's pace. For example, when transplanting rice seedlings in the spring, the schedule stipulated that the task of transplanting rice seedlings should be completed on April 18. However, by the 17th, less than 30% of the whole township had been completed. The masses repeatedly requested an extension of a few days, but the "supervisors" not only refused, but also flew into a rage, roaring, "Even if you have to stay up all night to finish planting! The superiors have stipulated that whoever dares not to obey will be punished!" Forcing some of the masses to plant crudely and carelessly to get the job done. Even so, it was not finished until after the 25th.
    After a spring rain, it was a good time to plant sorghum. Before dawn, people were consciously busy on the hillside. Who knew, when the resident township staff came to see it, they were so frightened that they broke out in a cold sweat, and said in a stern voice: "The above stipulates that you should plow the fields today, what are you doing coming to the hillside?" As they spoke, they ran back to the township government, mobilized the whole team, and forced the people who were rushing to plant sorghum to plow the fields. And they threatened: whoever does not obey will have work points deducted. The people left the hillside dejectedly, and the season for planting sorghum was missed by several days. The director of Guangming Second Cooperative told me: This year, the sorghum in the cooperative was planted a few days late, missed the rain, and the yield was at least 30% less.
    The people here call those self-righteous people who want the farmers to work according to the "schedule" as "June cuckoos, who don't know spring and autumn." It should be said that such a nickname is not very pleasant; but, what's wrong with giving this nickname to such subjectivists?

    “六月的斑鸠”
    田光
    我来到四川富顺县代寺区区委的重点乡（广福乡），参加了一次农业社社员座谈会。会上，社员们兴奋地谈着今年全乡基本合作化以后，在生产上获得的巨大成绩。可以看出，他们对今年农业增产是满怀信心的。可是，说到最后，大家忽然不约而同地叹息起来。有人说：“唉！要不是那群斑鸠，今年的收成还要更好一些哟！”
    “怎么？你们这里的鸟害挺严重吗？”我的话一下子引起哄堂大笑。这一阵突如其来的笑声，真使我摸不着头脑。在我的一再请求下，他们终于向我公布了“谜底”：
    说起来也奇怪，合作化以后，这里的领导机关实行了一种新鲜的“具体领导”的方法。他们给全体农民统一制定了生产日程表，命令所有的农民群众，按照他们的“口令”齐步前进。驻乡工作人员成了监视群众按日程表做事的“督察员”。他们拿着日程表，检查着每一个人的步伐。例如：春天插秧的时候，日程表上规定四月十八日完成插秧任务。可是，到十七日全乡才完成不到30％。群众一再请求宽限几天，“督察员”不但不准，还大发雷霆，吼着说：“栽不完熬夜也要栽下去！上级规定，谁敢不遵？”逼得有些群众只好粗制滥造胡乱栽下去交差。即使这样，还是到二十五日以后才栽完。
    一阵春雨以后，正是种高粱的好时光。天没亮，人们都自觉地在山坡上忙了起来。谁知，驻乡工作人员跑来一看，吓得一身冷汗，声色具厉地说：“上面规定今天犁田，你们到坡上来干什么？”说着跑着回乡政府，调出全班人马，硬逼着抢栽高粱的人们去犁田。并且扬言：谁不服从，一定要扣工分。人们垂头丧气地离开了山坡，栽高粱的季节也跟着错过了几天。光明二分社的主任告诉我：今年社里高粱因为迟栽了几天，错过了雨水，起码少收三成。
    对这些自作聪明的要农民按“日程表”办事的人们，这里的群众把他们叫做“六月的斑鸠，不知春秋”。应该说这样的绰号是不太美妙的；但是，把这绰号送给这样的主观主义者，又有什么不好呢？
