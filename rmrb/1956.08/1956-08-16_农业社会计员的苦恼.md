    The Troubles of Agricultural Cooperative Accountants
    I have recently heard many accountants from agricultural cooperatives complaining, saying, "We are truly helpless against these forms coming from all directions!" The leader of the Niushan Township accounting network said, "Every day, each cooperative has to send a daily report to the district. In less than half a month, each cooperative fills out a total of thirty-four forms. The content of some of these forms is very similar, especially the eight forms sent by the grain store, which the district government has already statistically processed many times. Each time they are needed urgently. Those who want the forms often use threatening tones to achieve their goals. Some say, "If the figures are not accurate, you will be held legally responsible!" Others say, "If you don't send them to the township before lunch, you will be fined and have to send them to the district yourself!" The large number of forms makes it impossible for us to keep the books on time. Several days' worth of accounts are piled up to be recorded together, making it difficult to avoid confusion in the financial accounts, which also affects the smooth progress of the summer harvest pre-distribution. A few days ago, the accountants were attending a financial rectification work conference in the district when suddenly eight more forms arrived (some were issued by the district, others by the grain store), which disrupted the conference. If this continues, how can the work of agricultural cooperative accountants be done well?"

    农业社会计员的苦恼
    我最近听到许多农业社的会计员诉苦说：“我们真奈何不了那些来自各方的表格！”牛山乡会计网的领导人说：“每天我们各社除了要向区送一份日报表以外，不到半个月每个社共填了三十四张表。这些表有的内容相差很有限，尤其是粮店送来的八张表，是区公所统计过很多次的。每次要的都很急。要表的人为了达到他们的目的，还常常用一些威胁的口气。有的说：“数字不精确要负法律责任！”有的说：“午饭前送不到乡，罚你自己送到区公所！”表格如此之多，使我们根本没有记账的时间，几天的账堆在一起记，财务账目很难避免混乱，也影响了夏收预分的顺利进行。前几天会计员在区里开财务整顿工作会议，突然又来了八张表格（有的是区里发的，有的是粮店里发的）就把这个会议冲散了。这样下去，农业社会计员的工作怎么能做好呢？
