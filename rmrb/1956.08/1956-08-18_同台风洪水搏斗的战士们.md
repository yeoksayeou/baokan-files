The Warriors Fighting Against Typhoon and Flood

Using Bodies to Block the Flood

	In the pitch-black night, the people of Anyang City, Henan Province, who were involved in the emergency rescue, had all gone back to rest. Only Public Security Army soldiers Qiu Guangyun and Fu Junjie patrolled back and forth on the embankment, monitoring the movement of the flood, braving the wind and rain.

	Suddenly, a breach was washed open in the embankment by a wave, and floodwaters surged in. The breach gradually widened, and there was soon a risk of collapse. Qiu Guangyun said to Fu Junjie, "You go back and report quickly, I'll block it here." Fu Junjie wanted to stay as well, but he couldn't argue with Qiu Guangyun, so he hurried to report. Qiu Guangyun jumped into the raging waves and rushed towards the breach. He grabbed the embankment with both hands and used his chest to block the onrushing flood.

	Minute after minute passed, and when everyone rushed to the rescue, Qiu Guangyun was already cold all over and unconscious. In the hospital, Qiu Guangyun woke up, and his first question was whether the breach had been blocked. The nurse told him that it had been blocked, and he lay down to rest with peace of mind.

Cannot Allow Machines to Stop Running

	A pharmaceutical factory and a glass factory on the outskirts of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, were flooded, and the surrounding low-lying area became a large "lake," with the factory buildings standing like isolated islands in the water. In a small river nearby, the water level had already risen to the top of the embankment. If it overflowed the dam, the factories would have to shut down. The military school personnel who were staying on campus during their summer vacation mobilized, picked up tools, and jumped into the water. They walked in the shallow parts and swam in the deep parts to transport mud to the center of the "lake." Some comrades found small boats, and others used wood to build rafts to transport bags of mud to the embankment. Some simply lifted the heavy sacks and felt their way through the deep water. After six hours of struggle, they filled 1,500 bags of mud and built a mud bag wall one meter wide and fifty centimeters high on the 400-meter-long embankment, blocking the rising river water and allowing the machines in the factory to continue to make rhythmic sounds.

Kindness Deeper Than the Sea

	On the evening of August 2nd, the two thatched houses of Song Xiujing, a porter at the State-owned Huaibei Salt Field in Xin Hailian City, Jiangsu Province, were blown down by the typhoon. Cries for help awakened the officers and soldiers who were stationed there. Platoon Leader Yang Jingyu led five soldiers to the rescue. They rescued Song Xiujing, who had been crushed and fainted, and helped the doctor administer emergency treatment until Song Xiujing was out of danger before leaving. Who knew that on the dark return journey, Liu Guangfu and Wen Jingyun were electrocuted when they encountered a fallen power line. Despite emergency treatment, they unfortunately sacrificed their lives. The worker comrades were all very sad, and Song Xiujing, who had been rescued, said, "I will never forget the Liberation Army comrades who sacrificed themselves to save me!"

	On the afternoon of the 4th, more than 2,000 citizens and salt field workers in Xin Hailian City held a memorial service to mourn the two martyrs, Liu and Wen. (Shen Min)

For 119 Lives

	A level 12 typhoon hit the skies over Dinghai, Zhejiang Province. The roofs of many houses near the sea were blown off, and the walls collapsed. In the dark night of wind and rain, the cries of women, shouts for help, and the weeping of children rang out.

	The commanders of a naval company immediately organized a rescue team of more than 70 people and set off to rescue people, wading through waist-deep tidal water. They acted as if they were going into battle, some carrying, some hugging, and holding the children on their heads in the deep water, helping the elderly, women, and children escape from danger. Soldier Lin Genxiang was originally physically weak, but he did his best and rescued nine children. After four hours of struggle, they rescued a total of 119 people.

	The officers and soldiers of this company also took great care of the disaster-stricken residents. They set up beds in the barracks, took out their own quilts, and arranged for the victims to stay; Platoon Leader Yu Guicheng, who had only been married for a short time, also gave his new house to a mother with five children.

	The practical actions of the naval soldiers in cherishing the people deeply moved the local residents. Huang Shande, the director of the Limin Agricultural Cooperative, whose family of seven had been rescued, held the instructor's hand, too excited to say a word for a long time: "You are too good, you usually help our cooperative with farming and harvesting, and today you risked the wind and rain to save our family's lives."

Keep the Railway Open

	The embankment of the Jinhe River in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, collapsed, and the west side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway had become a vast expanse of water. The water level was still gradually rising. On the afternoon of the 4th, the roadbed was destroyed in five places, and north-south transportation was blocked. The officers of the cultural training team of a certain training regiment were ordered to come and began a tense repair. The slogan of everyone was "Gaining time is victory." However, the water flow was too fast, and the stones and sandbags thrown into the water were immediately washed away by the rapids. The best way was to drive piles and lower gates, but there were no materials. What to do? At this moment, only the sound of "It's time to make contributions to the motherland!" could be heard. Several comrades immediately jumped into the water. They built a dam with their bodies, and persisted in the cold water for two or three hours, blocking the river water and allowing other comrades to fill sand and sink stones to block the breach. Every time they repaired a breach, everyone cheered victoriously "Another enemy has been eliminated." The sounds of encouragement, cheers, and rapids intertwined on the entire construction site. After two days and two nights of fierce fighting, the train loaded with goods finally passed smoothly and headed south. (An Cai)

Rescuing the "Treasure of Treasures"

	At a little after 2:00 a.m. on August 5th, the Caohe River's water level rose sharply, and more than three million catties of grain in the grain depot of Xushui County, Hebei Province, urgently needed to be rescued. A certain training regiment received the notification and immediately dispatched all the officers and soldiers of the 3rd and 13th companies.

	On the thirty li of muddy road, there were water pits and smooth stones. In the darkness, people fell and got up again. Their knees were skinned, and stones pierced their feet, but the team still marched at a rapid pace, and no one fell behind.

	The grain stacks were surrounded in the middle by floodwaters more than one person deep. To transport them out, a temporary bridge had to be built first. A tense battle began. They bundled the sleepers piled on the side of the railway into rectangular bridge piers, and the soldiers climbed onto the wooden piers and pressed downwards, sinking the wooden piers to the bottom of the water in the highly buoyant water. The newly applied asphalt on the sleepers stuck to people's skin, and it was painfully hot when exposed to the sun, but everyone wanted to build the bridge one minute earlier and transport the grain one minute earlier, so no one paid attention to it.

	At 4:00 p.m., the two bridges were built one after another. The soldiers climbed onto the high grain stacks, shoveling grain, filling bags, sewing bags, carrying, stacking bags, and working really happily. After two days and nights of selfless work by hundreds of soldiers, 3.2 million catties of grain were rescued from the flood.

    同台风洪水搏斗的战士们
    用身体堵住洪流
    漆黑的夜里，河南省安阳市抢险的人们都回去休息了，只有公安军战士丘光云、傅俊杰冒着风雨在堤上来回巡逻，监视着洪水的动静。
    突然，堤岸被浪头冲开一个窟窿，洪水往里直涌，窟窿渐渐扩大，很快就会有溃决的危险。丘光云对傅俊杰说：“你赶快回去报告，我在这里堵住。”傅俊杰自己也想留下，但是他争不过丘光云，便赶忙去报告了。丘光云跳入滚滚的波涛中，向窟窿扑去。他两手抓住大堤，用胸膛挡住了冲击着的洪水。
    时间一分钟、一分钟地过去，当大家赶来抢险的时候，丘光云已全身冰凉失去了知觉。在医院里，丘光云苏醒过来了，他第一句话就问窟窿堵住了没有？护士告诉他已经堵好了，他才安心地躺下来休息。

    不能让机器停止运转
    河南开封市郊某制药厂和玻璃厂附近被水淹了，周围一片洼地成了一个大“湖”，厂房像孤岛一样挺立在水中。旁边的一条小河里，河水已经涨到堤顶，如果漫过堤坝来，工厂就要停工。正在度暑假的某军校留校人员动员起来了，他们拿起工具，跳下水去，浅的地方就走，深的地方就游，到“湖”心去运泥土。有的同志找来了小船，有的用木料扎成木排把成袋的泥土运上堤去，有的干脆抬起沉重的麻袋从深水中摸过去。经过六小时的斗争，他们装填了一千五百包泥土，在四百公尺长的堤面上，垒起了一公尺宽、五十公分高的土袋，拦住了还在继续上涨的河水，让工厂里的机器继续不断地发出有节奏的声响。
              （卢长孺、姜铭）
    恩情似海深
    八月二日晚上，江苏省新海连市国营淮北盐场搬运工人宋修景家的两间草房被台风刮倒了。求救的呼声唤醒了住在这里的官兵们，排长杨景余带领了五个士兵赶去抢救。他们救出了已被压昏的宋修景，并且帮助医生施行急救，直到宋修景脱离危险时才离开。谁知在漆黑的归途中，刘光福、温景云两人碰上被风刮倒的电线触电了，虽经急救，终于不幸牺牲。工人同志们都非常悲痛，被救出险的宋修景说：“我永远忘不了为了救我而牺牲自己的解放军同志！”
    四日下午，新海连市市民、盐场工人二千多人举行了追悼大会，悼念刘、温二烈士。　（沈敏）
    为了一百十九条生命
    十二级台风刮到了浙江省定海上空，海边的许多民房的屋顶被掀掉了，墙被吹倒了。在风雨交加的黑夜里，妇女的呼喊声、救命声，小孩的啼哭声响成一片。
    海军某连的指挥员们立刻组织了七十多人的抢救队，涉着齐腰深的潮水出发前去抢救。他们像投入战斗一样，有的背、有的抱，在深水里就把孩子顶在头上，帮助老人、妇女、儿童脱离险境。战士林根祥本来体力较弱，可是他尽了最大的努力，救出了九个孩子。经过四小时的斗争，他们共救出了一百十九人。
    这个连的官兵们还非常热情地照顾了遇难的居民们。他们在营房里架起床铺，把自己的棉被拿出来，安排受难的人们住下；排长余桂成刚结婚不久，也把自己的新房让给了一位带着五个孩子的母亲。
    海军战士爱护人民的实际行动深深感动了当地的居民们。一家七口被救的利民农业社主任黄善德拉着指导员的手，激动得半天才说出一句话来：“你们太好了，平时帮助我们社里耕种、收割，今天又冒着风雨救了我们一家人生命。”
                      （王敏德）
    让铁路畅通
    河北省栾城县金河的河堤溃决了，京汉铁路路西已成一片汪洋，水势还在逐渐上涨。四日下午，路基被冲毁五处，南北交通受到阻碍。某部训练团文化训练队的军官们奉命赶来，开始了紧张的抢修。大家的口号是“争取时间就是胜利”。但是，水流太急，石块沙袋投入水里，马上就被急流冲走。最好的办法是打桩、下闸，可是没有材料，怎么办呢？就在这时，只听得一声
  “为祖国立功的时候到了！”好几个同志随即跳入水里，他们以人体筑起了一道大坝，在寒冷的水里坚持了二、三小时，挡住河水，让别的同志填沙沉石，堵住了缺口。每当他们修好一个缺口的时候，大家都胜利欢呼“又消灭了一股敌人。”整个工地上鼓励声、欢呼声、激流声交织成一片，经过两天两夜的激烈战斗，终于使满载货物的列车顺利通过，驶向南方。　（安才）
    抢救“宝中之宝”
    八月五日早晨两点多钟，漕河水位猛涨，河北省徐水县粮食仓库三百多万斤粮食急需抢救。某训练团接到了通知，立刻调拨三连和十三连的全体官兵出发。
    三十里泥泞的路上，有水坑也有光峭的石子。黑暗中，人们跌倒了又爬起来，膝盖跌破了皮，石子扎进了脚心，然而队伍仍以急行军速度前进，没有一个人掉队。
    粮垛被一人多深的洪水包围在中间，想运输出来，首先要架便桥。紧张的战斗开始了。他们把堆在铁路边的枕木捆扎成长方形的桥墩，战士们爬上木墩向下压，在浮力很大的水里，把木墩沉倒水底。枕木上新涂的沥青，沾在人们的皮肤上，被太阳一晒，火辣辣地痛得难受，但是谁都想早一分钟把桥架好，早一分钟把粮食运出来，所以谁也没有理它。
    下午四点钟，两座桥先后架好了。战士们爬上了高高的粮垛，铲粮、装包、缝包、搬运、叠包，干得真欢。经过数百个战士两昼夜的忘我劳动，三百二十万斤粮食从洪水中全部被抢救出来了。
