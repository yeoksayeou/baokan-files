A "League Branch Secretary" Who Is Neither a Party Member Nor a League Member

In the recent merger of districts and townships, some localities, in order to settle cadres who were semi-detached from production in the original small townships, have gone so far as to violate organizational principles by appointing some non-Party and non-League cadres as township general branch secretaries of the Communist Youth League. Of the 517 township general branch secretaries of the League recently appointed in sixteen counties, including Ruijin and Gao'an in Jiangxi Province, 52 were "League branch secretaries" who were neither Party members nor League members; of the 48 township general branch secretaries of the League in Jiujiang County, 10 were neither Party members nor League members.

The Communist Youth League is an organization of advanced youth under the leadership of the Party, and it is the Party's assistant and reserve force. Therefore, the secretaries of its grassroots organizations should be young Communist Party members or outstanding League members. If anyone who is neither a Party member nor a League member can serve as a League branch secretary, then what kind of organization is the Communist Youth League? And how can it play its due role? These county and district Party committees and League committees are simply "assigning cadres for the sake of assigning cadres." Why don't they consider organizational principles?

    不是党员团员的“团总支书记”
    在最近撤区并乡当中，有些地方为了安插原来小乡的半脱离生产的干部，不惜违背组织原则，将一些非党员也非团员的干部，配备为青年团的乡总支书记。江西省瑞金、高安等十六个县最近配备的517名团乡总支书记中，非党员也非团员的“团总支书记”就有五十二名；九江县四十八名团乡总支书记中，就有十名是非党员也非团员。
    青年团是党领导的先进青年的组织，它是党的助手和后备军。因此，它的基层组织的书记应当由年轻的共产党员或者优秀的青年团员来担任，如果任何一个非党员也非团员都可担任团支部书记，那么青年团算是一个什么组织呢？又怎样能发挥青年团应有的作用呢？这些县、区党委和团委只是为了“安插干部而安插干部”，为什么不考虑一下组织原则呢？
