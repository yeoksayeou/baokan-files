　　Over Three Thousand Jin of Wheat

　　It rained all night long. The next morning, the twelve mu of wheat along the river belonging to the Wanfu Agricultural Cooperative in Jincheng County, Shanxi, were gone! The river water flowed through the wheat fields, turning them into a stretch of mud and sand. The cooperative cadres and members all sighed: over three thousand jin of wheat are finished! But upon closer inspection, it didn't seem like the river had washed it all away – there were still wheat stubbles left standing.

　　It turned out that this is what happened: that night, as the rain was falling,社员 Wang Yuxiu, an old man living by the river, couldn't sleep. Hearing the rain growing heavier and the river roaring more fiercely, he thought of the twelve mu of wheat along the river. He quickly got out of bed, woke up his wife and children, and then woke up the社员 Xiao Tu and Yao Xian who lived in the same courtyard. Grabbing their sickles, they rushed to the wheat field. When they arrived, the river water had risen to within about two chi of the wheat field. They began harvesting in earnest. After a while, the社员 Chen Wenlin and Guo Shengyun also arrived. Before dawn, they had cut down all twelve mu of wheat and transported it to the horse stable. Soon after they left the wheat field, the river water rushed in.

　　The next day, the Party branch and the cooperative management committee, taking advantage of the rainy weather that prevented them from working in the fields, convened a meeting of all the cooperative members, awarded Wang Yuxiu a bonus, and called him a model of loving the cooperative. The other社员 who participated in the rush harvest also received material rewards. 社员 Wang Sanhai said: If it weren't for Uncle Yuxiu, the cooperative's over three thousand jin of wheat would have been finished!

    三千多斤小麦
    整整下了一夜大雨。第二天的早晨，山西晋城县万福农业社沿河的十二亩小麦不见了！河水从麦田流过、麦田成了一片泥沙，社务干部、社员都长叹一声：三千多斤麦子完蛋了！可是仔细一看，又不像是河水冲走——还留有一棵一棵的麦茬呢。
    原来是这样一回事：那天晚上，雨正在下着。住在河边的社员王玉秀老汉，反来复去睡不着，听到雨越来越大，河水响的越来越猛，他想到沿河的十二亩小麦，很快从被窝里爬起来，推醒老婆、孩子，又叫醒了同院的社员小秃、要先，拿上镰刀向麦田奔去。当他们到达麦田时，河水涨到离麦田只差两尺左右。他们就紧张地动手收割起来。一会，社员陈文林、郭生云也赶来。不到天明，就把十二亩小麦割倒并运到马棚内。在他们离开麦田时，河水很快就冲入麦田。
    第二天，党支部和社管理委员会趁雨天不能下地的机会，召开了全体社员大会，发给王玉秀奖金，并称他为爱社模范。其他参加抢收的社员，也都得到了物质奖励。社员王三孩说：要不是玉秀叔，社里的三千多斤小麦就完蛋了！
