Xinhua News Agency report: How can commercial work better serve the people? At the Fourth Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which is currently being held, many representatives put forward constructive suggestions.

The representatives believe that Beijing's commercial work has made great achievements in the past few years, but due to the development of production and the continuous improvement of people's lives, commercial work is far from meeting the people's requirements. Although this problem cannot be completely solved for the time being, commercial departments should actively overcome current shortcomings and gradually improve them.

The representatives believe that although current commercial work cannot completely meet the people's needs for commodity varieties, strengthening planning, listening more to consumers' opinions, and communicating more with production departments will gradually improve this shortcoming. The representatives reflected that in the past, private shops would conduct trial sales before the season, mass promotions during the season, and sell leftovers at the end of the season; however, some state-owned and joint state-private shops are not adopting these good business methods, resulting in not stocking up before the season, stocking up heavily during the season, and stockpiling at the end of the season.

Some representatives believe that in Beijing, some local commercial institutions are currently too concentrated, while in other places, shops that were originally needed by consumers were closed during the adjustment of the commercial network, making it very inconvenient for the masses to buy goods.

The representatives believe that the original private shops had many experienced staff members, and if their potential could be fully utilized, it could solve some of the difficulties that the current commercial departments are facing due to staff shortages. However, many departments still have improper use of these personnel.

In their speeches, the representatives also pointed out that commercial departments should pay attention to improving the lives of commercial workers while improving their work.

    商业工作如何更好地为人民服务
    北京市人民代表提出许多建设性意见
    据新华社讯　商业工作如何更好地为人民服务？在正在举行的北京市第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，许多代表提出了建设性的意见。
    代表们认为，几年来北京市商业工作有很大的成绩，但是由于生产发展，人民生活不断改善，商业工作还远远不能满足人民要求。这一问题虽然一时不能完全解决，但是商业部门要积极克服目前缺点，逐步加以改进。
    代表们认为，目前商业工作虽然还不能完全满足人民对商品品种的需要，但是如果加强计划性，多倾听消费者的意见，多同生产部门联系，会使这一缺点逐步改进的。代表们反映，过去私营商店是：季前试销，季中大量推销，季末卖零头；但是现在一些国营商店和公私合营商店并不吸取这种好的经营方法，因而造成季前不进（货），季中大进，季末积压的现象。
    有些代表认为，目前北京市有些地方商业机构过于集中，而另一些地方原来为消费者需要的店铺，在调整商业网时被撤消了，使得群众买货很不方便。
    代表们认为原来私营商店有很多有经验的工作人员，如果能充分发挥他们的潜力，可以解决一些目前商业部门工作人员缺少的困难。但是目前许多部门对这些人员还有使用不当的现象。
    代表们发言中还指出，商业部门在改进工作的时候，要注意同时改善商业工作人员的生活。
