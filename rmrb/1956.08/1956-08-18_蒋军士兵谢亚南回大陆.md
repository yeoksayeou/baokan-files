Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 17th. A Taiwan Chiang army soldier has returned to the motherland via Hong Kong. His name is Xie Yanan, and he was a senior medic in the hospital of the Health Battalion of the First Division of the Chiang Army Marine Corps.

Xie Yanan recounted his thrilling experience of defecting to the motherland: "I was forced to join the Chiang army in 1948. In the Chiang army for more than eight years, I suffered all kinds of pain and torture. For a long time, I had been looking for an opportunity to break away from Taiwan and return to the mainland. On the ninth of this month, I ran from Zuoying to Kaohsiung. At ten o'clock in the evening, I discovered a cargo ship about to set sail for Hong Kong, so I dived into the water and swam to the stern of the ship, tying myself to an iron bar next to the rudder. After the ship started, I left Taiwan with the ship." Xie Yanan soaked in the sea for a full forty-four hours without being discovered. It was not until the ship was about to reach Hong Kong that he left the ship and swam ashore. He was discovered on the beach by British police and sent to a hospital. After regaining consciousness, he firmly requested the British authorities in Hong Kong to send him back to the mainland.

    蒋军士兵谢亚南回大陆
    据新华社广州17日电　一名台湾蒋军士兵经香港回到祖国大陆。他叫谢亚南，是蒋军海军陆战队第一师卫生营医院的上等救护兵。
    谢亚南叙述他投归祖国时的惊险经历说：“我1948年被迫参加蒋军。在蒋军部队中的八年多，我受尽了一切痛苦折磨。我长期以来就寻找机会，准备脱离台湾返回祖国大陆。本月九日，我从左营跑到高雄。晚上十点钟，我发现有一只货轮要启碇开往香港，我就潜入水中游到船尾，把自己缚在舵旁铁杆上。船启动后，我就随船离开了台湾。”谢亚南在海水中泡了整整四十四个小时，没有人发现他。直到船将抵香港的时候，他才离船游到岸上。他在海滩被英警发现，送入医院。他恢复知觉以后，就坚决要求香港英国当局把他送回祖国大陆。
