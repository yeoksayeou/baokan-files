　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, August 8th: The Northwest Nationalities Institute Song and Dance Troupe departed from Xining yesterday to tour pastoral areas. The troupe will perform for herdsmen in Hainan and Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures for more than a month. At the same time, they will also go deep into understanding the lives of minority nationalities, excavate and collate the folk art of the Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups in Qinghai, and enrich their performance repertoire.
　　The predecessor of the song and dance troupe was the Northwest Nationalities Institute Performing Arts Team. Since its establishment in 1952, it has frequently toured various parts of Gansu. This is its first time coming to Qinghai. Most of the troupe members were originally young people from various ethnic minorities in the Northwest who love art.
