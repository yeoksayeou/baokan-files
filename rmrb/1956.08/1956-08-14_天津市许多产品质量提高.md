　　Tianjin (By our report) - Since the beginning of this year, the quality of most of the 325 fixed products produced by state-owned and joint state-private enterprises in Tianjin has improved compared to last year. Among them, the improvement is more significant in 115 products. For example, the caustic soda produced by the jointly owned Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Factory is now pure white with no impurities, and it can compete with British products in the Indian market.
　　The quality of cotton textiles and printed and dyed goods has also improved significantly. In the first half of July, the first-grade, first-class rate of cotton yarn produced by the factories under the Tianjin Textile Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry reached 100%. The "Quan Jia Le" (Happy Family) brand calico produced by the state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory used to be called "Quan Jia Chou" (Family Worry) by consumers. Now, the patterns have increased, the shrinkage rate has decreased, and the color does not fade, so its reputation in the market has greatly improved.
　　However, in the first half of this year, while the quality of most products improved, the prime product rate of 53 products was too low, or individual performance did not meet national standards, and the quality of some products even decreased compared to the past. For example, the quality of Baijiu (white liquor) from Tianjin Winery, Zhongzhi Soap from China Oils and Fats Chemical Factory, glazed paper from Tianjin Paper Mill, and wire rod from Tianjin Steel Plant were not as good as last year. From April to July, Tianjin Winery lost about 600,000 jin of grain because the methanol content of Baijiu exceeded national standards and the liquor extraction rate was low.
　　In order to ensure that products with good quality become even better, that products that are not good quickly improve, and to actively increase the variety of products, the Industry and Transportation Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is prepared to require all enterprises to quickly formulate plans to improve product quality and increase variety.

    天津市许多产品质量提高
    本报讯　今年以来，天津市国营、公私合营企业生产的三百二十五种固定的产品中，绝大部分的质量都比去年提高了。其中提高得比较显著的有一百一十五种。如公私合营永利久大沽厂生产的烧碱，已经做到上下洁白，没有杂质，在印度市场上已经可以跟英国产品竞赛。
    棉纺织品、印染品的质量，也提高得比较显著。七月上半月，纺织工业部天津纺织管理局所属各厂的棉纱，一等一级品率已经达到100％。国营天津印染厂生产的“全家乐”牌花布，过去被消费者称为
  “全家愁”。现在花型图案增多，缩水率降低，又不掉色，在市场上的信誉提高了很多。
    但是，今年上半年，在绝大部分产品质量都有所提高的情况下，还有五十三种产品的正品率过低，或者个别性能达不到国家标准，有的产品质量还比过去降低了。如天津酒厂的白酒、中国油脂化学厂的中植皂、天津造纸厂的有光纸和天津钢厂的盘条等，质量都没有去年好。天津酒厂从四月到七月，因为白酒含甲醇量超过国家标准，出酒率低，共损失粮食六十万斤左右。
    为了保证现在质量好产品更加好，不好的产品迅速变好，和积极地增加产品品种，中共天津市委工业交通工作部准备要求所有企业都迅速制定改进产品质量和增加品种的规划。
