Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi stated in an article published in the August issue of "Oriental Economist" magazine that Japan's failure to enter the Southeast Asian market and the growing trend of discrimination against Japanese goods in Europe and the United States are forcing Japan to increasingly rely on China as a source of raw materials and a market for Japanese goods. He emphasized that even without these factors, Japan and mainland China are historically destined to have active economic exchanges. "Whether we like it or not, this is inevitable, and there is no avoiding it."

Ishibashi Tanzan reviewed past history and emphasized the importance of China as a crucial supplier of raw materials. He said that the economic relationship between Japan and mainland China is deeply rooted and long-standing. Japan's desire to restore its age-old trading partner's relationship will become more resolute and forceful.

Ishibashi Tanzan also stated that Japan must continue to be bound by the "international obligations" it has undertaken. "As for the obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade, no factor is more fundamental than the conflict between East and West... However, the developments in Southeast Asia in the decade since the end of the Pacific War have been very discouraging. Japan has been working hard to strengthen its economic relations with the Southeast Asian region outside of Communist China. But the results in Southeast Asia have not convinced Japan that it can abandon China. And worse, despite Japan's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, more Western European countries are discriminating against Japanese goods under the so-called Article 35 of the agreement. Resistance to Japanese goods is also severe in the United States."

Ishibashi Tanzan believes that these new developments have put the Japanese government in a difficult position and have given new impetus to those who demand more trade with China. He said that Japan has been working to relax the trade embargo against China and will continue to do so. However, Ishibashi made it clear that he does not want China to regard Japan's efforts to trade with China as any expression of its political inclinations.

    日本通商产业相石桥湛山认为
    日本必须积极同中国进行贸易
    新华社1日讯　日本通商产业相石桥湛山在八月号的“东方经济学家”杂志发表文章说，日本没有能够进入东南亚市场和欧美日益歧视日本货的趋势，正在迫使日本越来越指望中国作为日本的原料来源地和日本货物的推销市场。他强调说，即使没有这些因素，日本和大陆中国在历史上注定必须进行积极的经济来往。“不管我们喜欢不喜欢，这是必然的事情，要躲避是躲避不了的。”
    石桥湛山回顾了过去的历史并且着重指出作为原料的重要供应者的中国的重要性。他说，日本和大陆中国的经济关系是根深蒂固的，并且由来已久。日本要求恢复它的自古以来的贸易伙伴的心情将会变得更加坚决有力。
    石桥湛山又说，日本必须继续受它承担的“国际义务”的约束。“至于中日贸易的障碍，没有任何因素像东西方之间的冲突那样是更为根本性的原因……但是太平洋战争结束后十年之久的时期中的东南亚的事态发展是十分令人气馁的。日本一直在努力加强它同共产党中国以外的东南亚区域的经济关系。“但是在东南亚的结果并没有使日本相信可以放弃中国。而且更坏的是，尽管日本参加了国际关税及贸易总协定，却有更多的西欧国家凭借所谓协定的第三十五条歧视日本货物。抵制日本货物在美国也很厉害。”
    石桥湛山认为，这种新的事态发展已经使日本政府处于困难的地位，而且给予要求同中国进行更多的贸易的人以新的刺激。他说，日本一直在努力放宽对中国的贸易禁运并且将继续这样做。但是石桥表明，他不希望中国把日本对同中国进行贸易所作的努力看作是它的政治倾向的任何表现。
