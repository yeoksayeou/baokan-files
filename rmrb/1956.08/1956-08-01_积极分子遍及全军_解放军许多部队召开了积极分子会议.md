    Activists are Everywhere in the Army
    Many PLA Units Hold Activist Conferences
    (Our report) Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have held representative conferences of activists, commending the advanced deeds of various activists. Ma Qingshan, who joined a certain artillery unit stationed in Shanghai last year, has become an all-around gunner after more than a year of diligent study and hard training. In the first training phase this year, he achieved excellent results in thirteen subjects, scoring five points in nine subjects and four points in four subjects. Zhang Ziheng, the artillery platoon leader of a certain unit stationed in Yunnan Province, painstakingly calculated more than 15,800 artillery practice problems and created the "Visual Estimation Method for Determining the Basic Elements of Firing Calculation Table." Ling Wuyun, deputy director of navigation of a certain naval aviation unit, achieved seven five points and two four points in nine bombing missions. Zhang Fuying, a new recruit from a certain unit guarding Anshan Iron and Steel, can detect signs of malfunctions from the sound of machines and prevent accidents. A certain artillery squad of a certain unit in the Shenyang troops, after marching 3,200 miles and firing 1,357 shells in sixty-five months, did not damage a single part.
    Many activists have also emerged in the organs. Hu Jialiang, an assistant in a certain naval unit's organ, came up with the idea of using water and electricity tickets for the supply of water and electricity to ships at the wharf, saving 1,931 tons of fresh water in the first quarter of this year.
    Che Jie, a nurse at the First Military Medical University, has not had any accidents in six years and has not damaged any equipment in five years. Chen Xiongceng, director of orthopedics, and Wei Zheng, attending military doctor, of the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Troops, cured a patient with chronic femoral osteomyelitis who had undergone thirty-three operations without being cured.
    Among the advanced activists, there are also skilled horse breeders and excellent cooks. Zhang Shouhai, a feeder from a certain unit in the Shenyang troops, raised nine horses by himself and has not had any accidents in the past year. Yi Xueqing, a Yi ethnic cook from a certain unit stationed in Yunnan Province, and another cook can cook well for 300 people. The cooking squad of the Second Company of a certain unit stationed in Fujian Province, constantly improved their cooking skills, saving more than 2,000 kilograms of rice in ten months and more than 20,000 kilograms of firewood in eleven months.
