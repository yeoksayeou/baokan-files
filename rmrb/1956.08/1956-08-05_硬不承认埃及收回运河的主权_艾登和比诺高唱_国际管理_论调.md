Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd dispatch from London: The British House of Commons debated the situation caused by Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company on August 2nd.

Prime Minister Eden spoke during the debate. He emphasized that he could not yet issue a formal statement on the Suez Canal issue because the talks between Britain, France, and the United States on the matter were still ongoing. At the same time, Eden reiterated that the British government did not intend to recognize Egypt's sovereignty over the nationalized Suez Canal Company.

Eden insisted that a so-called "international body" manage the Suez Canal. He said, "Anything other than this is unacceptable to us." He emphasized the "special nature" of the Suez Canal, saying that the industrial life of Western Europe depended on the freedom of navigation through this canal, and stubbornly insisted that only an international body could guarantee freedom of navigation.

Eden announced that the British government was currently taking "certain precautionary measures of a military nature" to "strengthen Britain's position in the Eastern Mediterranean and to deal with any situation that may arise."

Xinhua News Agency, August 4th dispatch from Paris: French Foreign Minister Pineau, reporting to the National Assembly on August 3rd on the results of the British-French-American talks, refused to recognize Egypt's right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, stubbornly claiming that this measure by Egypt violated international law and insisted on so-called "international management" of the canal. He said, "The French government has adopted the firmest possible attitude in demanding that the canal be placed under international management."

Speaking about the scheduled international conference on the Suez Canal issue, Pineau said that Britain, France, and the United States had reached an agreement in principle on the draft agenda for the London conference. An international management and administrative body must be established to be responsible for the operation of the Suez Canal's affairs "for an indefinite period." He also said that this body would have very broad powers, and the French government believed that it should also be responsible for the security of the Suez Canal.

Pineau openly demanded that Nasser "yield," to "completely withdraw the measures he has taken, thereby admitting his mistake." If "he is unwilling to yield," France would "take all measures to force him to yield." Pineau announced that the French and British governments had both "immediately taken precautionary measures of a military nature," although he also said that "France hopes to resolve this issue peacefully." Pineau revealed that the reason France wanted to do this was also because it believed that "the entire situation in North Africa depends on whether the actions now being taken are effective."

Subsequently, French Prime Minister Mollet also spoke. He repeated Pineau's rhetoric, stubbornly insisting that only international control could guarantee freedom of navigation on the canal.

    硬不承认埃及收回运河的主权
    艾登和比诺高唱“国际管理”论调
    据新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：英国议会下院八月二日就埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有所造成的局势进行了辩论。
    艾登首相在辩论中发言。他着重指出，他还不能够就苏彝士运河问题发表正式声明，因为英、法、美三国关于这个问题的会谈仍然在进行中。同时，艾登重申，英国政府不打算承认埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的主权。
    艾登坚持要由一个所谓“国际机构”来管理苏彝士运河。他说：“除了这一点以外，任何别的东西都是我们不能接受的。”他强调苏彝士运河的“特殊性”，说西欧的工业生命依赖于这条运河的通航自由，并且硬说只有一个国际机构才能够保证通航自由。
    艾登宣布，英国政府目前正在采取“军事性质的某些预防措施”，以便“加强英国在地中海东部的地位和对付可能发生的任何情况”。
    据新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺八月三日向国民议会报告英法美三国会谈结果的时候，拒绝承认埃及有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，硬说埃及这种措施违反了国际法，而且坚持要对这条运河实行所谓“国际管理”。他说：“法国政府采取最坚定不过的态度要求使运河归国际管理。”
    比诺谈到预定召开的关于苏彝士运河问题的国际会议说，英、法、美三国已经就伦敦会议的议程草案原则达成了协议。必须成立一个国际管理和行政机构，让它“在无限的时间内”负责经营苏彝士运河的事务。他还说，这个机构将拥有非常广泛的权力，而且，法国政府认为，它还应该负责苏彝士运河的安全。
    比诺公然要纳赛尔“屈服”。要他“完全撤销他已经采取的措施，从而承认自己的错误”。如果“他不愿意屈服”，法国就要“采取一切措施来迫使他屈服”。比诺宣布，法国和英国政府都“立即采取了军事性质的预防措施”，尽管他又说，“法国希望能够和平解决这个问题”。比诺透露，法国之所以要这样做，还因为它认为“整个北非局势都取决于现在所采取的行动是否有效”。
    接着法国总理摩勒也发了言。他重复了比诺的论调，硬说只有国际管制才能保证运河的航行自由。
