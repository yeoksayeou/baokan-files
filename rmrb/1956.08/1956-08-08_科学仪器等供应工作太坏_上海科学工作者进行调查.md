Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th: The current shortage of scientific instruments and experimental animals in the market has affected the progress of scientific research and teaching in universities.

Recently, some scientific workers and professors in Shanghai formed a special group to investigate these two issues and requested the government to help them improve working conditions in this regard.

Shanghai has always been a base for instrument production in China, but since the high tide of socialist transformation this year, the original cooperative relationships between research institutions, universities, and some factories and independent laborers have been interrupted. Some factories that produced high-quality instruments have now switched to producing other industrial products. Professional companies often fail to supply or delay supplying the small quantities, diverse varieties, and special specifications of equipment and materials needed by research institutions and universities. Common laboratory equipment and instruments are often out of stock on the market. When instruments break down, it is difficult to find a place to repair them. The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences completed only 58% of its procurement projects in the first quarter of this year and only 46% in the second quarter. This situation affects the progress of scientific research.

Shanghai needs a lot of animals for experimentation every year. At present, only a few animal stores in the Old City God Temple supply a small number of animals. Not only is the quantity insufficient, but most of them are impure breeds and cannot be used for experiments. Various units send people to rural areas in other places to purchase them themselves, which creates problems for transportation and breeding. This situation creates difficulties for scientific research in biology, medicine, pharmacology, and other fields.

Scientists suggest establishing specialized departments for the production and supply of instruments and equipment, collecting and reprinting information on foreign instruments, and strengthening the manufacturing and import of scientific instruments; at the same time, establishing a reasonably sized experimental animal breeding farm to uniformly supply purebred experimental animals.

### 科学仪器等供应工作太坏  上海科学工作者进行调查

    科学仪器等供应工作太坏
    上海科学工作者进行调查
    据新华社上海5日电　目前市场上科学仪器和实验动物的供应不足，已影响了科学研究和高等学校教学工作的进行。
    上海部分科学工作者和教授们最近组成专门小组对这两个问题进行了调查研究，并要求政府帮助他们改善这方面的工作条件。
    上海一向是国内仪器生产的一个基地，但自从今年社会主义改造高潮以后，研究机关、高等学校和一些工厂、独立劳动者原有的协作关系中断了。有些生产仪器质量较高的工厂，现在改为生产别的工业品，各专业公司对研究机关和高等学校所需要的数量少、品种多、规格又特殊的器材和材料，往往不予供应或推迟供应。一般常用的实验用具和仪器，市面上常常脱销。仪器坏了，也找不到地方修理。中国科学院上海办事处今年第一季度的采购项目，只完成了58％，第二季度只完成了46％。这种情况影响科学研究工作的进行。
    上海每年都需要很多供实验用的动物。目前只有老城隍庙几家动物商店供应少量动物，不仅数量不能满足，而且大多品种不纯，不能作实验用。各单位自己派人到外地农村去采购，运送和饲养都成问题。这种情况造成了生物学、医学、药学等方面科学研究的困难。
    科学家们建议成立专门的仪器设备生产和供应部门，搜集和翻印国外仪器的资料，加强科学仪器的制造和进口工作；同时建立相当规模的实验动物饲养场，统一供给纯品种的实验动物。
