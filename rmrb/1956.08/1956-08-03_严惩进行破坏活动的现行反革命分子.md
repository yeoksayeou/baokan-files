Editorial:

The three cases of dealing with counter-revolutionaries published in today's newspaper clearly illustrate the specific policy of the People's Government towards counter-revolutionaries. The Liaoyuan City of Jilin Province exempted counter-revolutionary Yang Chengcai from prosecution and granted him material rewards and employment opportunities, embodying the policy of leniency for confession, atonement for crimes through meritorious service, and rewards for great merit. The People's Court of Bao'an County in Guangdong Province legally sentenced counter-revolutionary Liu Li to death, and counter-revolutionary Wan Yuchang in Fengtai County, Anhui Province, was shot and killed on the spot for attacking and resisting arrest. This embodies the other side of the policy: severity for resistance, severity from now on, and severe sanctions against counter-revolutionaries who continue to engage in destructive activities. We have talked a lot about the lenient aspect in this newspaper some time ago; now we want to talk about the severe aspect.

From the second half of last year to the present, many counter-revolutionaries have surrendered and confessed to the People's Government. Among them, some were counter-revolutionaries who had committed serious crimes in the past, and some were current counter-revolutionaries, including spies and agents sent by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek Group from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places. However, there are still a few counter-revolutionaries who are unrepentant. For example, counter-revolutionary Wan Yuchang from Fengtai County, Anhui Province, killed the mother, wife, son, daughter, and sister-in-law—a total of five people—of Wang Kezhong, the militia captain and village people's representative, with a knife. Counter-revolutionary Liu Li from Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, took advantage of the broad masses of the people celebrating "May Day" Labor Day to blow up the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway. These two cases tell us that some people believe that since the international and domestic situation is very favorable to us, no one among the counter-revolutionaries will persist in the counter-revolutionary stance. This idea is not realistic. In fact, there are indeed guys who persist in the counter-revolutionary stance and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and they will seriously harm us when we relax our vigilance.

Even among those who have apparently confessed and surrendered, there are still a few who are not sincere, but want to use the lenient aspect of our policy to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. There was a counter-revolutionary in Yingjiang County, Yunnan Province, named Liu Renbao, who had participated in organizing counter-revolutionary riots after liberation, personally killed peasants, and killed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. In 1952, this guy, having nowhere to hide, surrendered to our public security organs and received lenient treatment. Soon after, he engaged in counter-revolutionary activities again, killing one person. Afterwards, he fled abroad and joined the Chiang gang's counter-revolutionary armed organization, serving as a company commander. In 1953, he sneaked back into the country and falsely surrendered to the public security organs again, once again deceiving the People's Government into lenient treatment, continuing to carry out assassination activities, and secretly developing counter-revolutionary organizations. Later, he once again crossed the border illegally to contact bandit leaders, until he was finally captured and executed by us.

Guys who are so stupid and stubborn are only a minority among the counter-revolutionaries, but this is not an isolated or unique case. Therefore, we must always pay attention to this situation, take precautions in all aspects, and do a good job in organization to prevent the schemes of these hidden enemies from succeeding.

For those guys who have been captured and who persist in the counter-revolutionary stance, continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and are unwilling to let go, can we be as lenient and indulgent as in the case of Yunnan's Yingjiang County? We think it is not possible. Lenient treatment of those guys can only encourage them to continue their counter-revolution, only encourage them to continue to sabotage our railways, factories, mines, agricultural production cooperatives, and only encourage them to continue killing people. In this way, the safety of the people and the country's socialist construction will not be guaranteed. The broad masses of the people will absolutely not support this practice. They will accuse the Party and the People's Government of committing the error of "unbounded leniency" again. In this way, the Party and the People's Government are in danger of becoming divorced from the masses. We had historical lessons in some areas regarding this point in the early days of liberation. Only by severely punishing these current counter-revolutionaries who dare to continue to engage in destructive activities can we make those stubborn and die-hard counter-revolutionaries fearful and dare not continue to do evil; and make those counter-revolutionaries who are hesitant and wavering determined to take the path of self-renewal, promoting the further disintegration of the counter-revolutionaries. Only by implementing this policy can we protect the people's enthusiasm for eliminating traitors and their political initiative, so that the Party and the People's Government can get the support of the people in the struggle against eliminating traitors and counter-espionage.

However, we must still explain that what we want to deal with severely are only the few die-hard counter-revolutionaries mentioned above, and does not include the majority who are willing to confess and start anew. For all counter-revolutionaries who have seen the bright future and are unwilling to follow imperialism and their running dogs into the grave, the door of our lenient policy is always open. They can make a thorough confession to the People's Government at any time, and they always have the opportunity to atone for their crimes and start anew. They should make up their minds as soon as possible and stop hesitating. Know that if you do not confess yourself, your crimes will eventually be settled, and it will be too late to regret it. As for those guys who are still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and extremely hate the people, their future is only to be severely punished. However, if they are willing to lay down their butcher knives and surrender, the People's Government can still treat them leniently; if they do not surrender, the people will definitely suppress them!

### 严惩进行破坏活动的现行反革命分子

    严惩进行破坏活动的现行反革命分子
    今天本报发表的三个处理反革命分子的案件，很清楚地说明了人民政府对待反革命分子的具体政策。吉林省辽源市对反革命分子杨成才免予起诉，并给予物质奖励和就业机会，体现了坦白从宽、立功赎罪、立大功受奖的政策。广东省宝安县人民法院依法将反革命分子刘立处死、安徽省凤台县反革命分子万玉昌行凶拒捕，当场被击毙，便是体现了政策的另一面——抗拒从严、今后从严，对继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子实行严厉制裁。关于从宽的一面，本报前些时已经讲得很多；现在要谈一下从严的一面。
    从去年后半年到现在，许许多多的反革命分子向人民政府自首坦白了。其中有一些是历史上犯有严重罪行的反革命分子，也有的是现行的反革命分子，包括帝国主义和蒋介石集团从台湾、香港等地派来的间谍特务分子。但是，仍然有少数反革命分子死不悔改。例如安徽省凤台县的反革命分子万玉昌持刀杀死了民兵队长、村人民代表王克中的母、妻、子、女、嫂一共五口。广东省宝安县的反革命分子刘立，则乘着广大人民群众正在欢度“五一”劳动节的时候，爆炸我广（州）深（圳）铁路。这两个案件告诉我们：有一些人以为国际国内形势既然对我非常有利，反革命分子中间也就再不会有人坚持反革命立场。这种想法是不合乎实际的。事实上，坚持反革命立场继续干着反革命勾当的家伙是确实有的，并且还要乘我们放松戒备的时候严重地危害我们。
    就是已经表面上坦白自首了的分子，也还有少数并非出自真心，而是想利用我们政策中宽大的一面来进行反革命活动。云南省盈江县有一个反革命分子名叫刘仁宝，解放以后还参加组织过反革命暴乱，亲手杀死过农民，打死过解放军战士。1952年这家伙因为无处藏身，向我公安机关自首，获得宽大处理。以后不久，他又进行反革命活动，杀死一人。事后逃往国外，参加了蒋帮的反革命武装组织，任中队长。1953年潜回国内，又向公安机关假自首，再一次骗取了人民政府的宽大处理，继续进行暗杀活动，并且秘密发展反革命组织。以后又再次偷越国境同匪首联络，一直到最后被我捕获处死。
    愚蠢和顽固到这样程度的家伙在反革命分子中间只是少数，但是这不是个别的或仅有的。所以我们就必须时刻注意到这种情况，从各方面进行戒备，作好组织工作，使这些暗藏敌人的阴谋不能得逞。
    对于已经捕获的这类坚持反革命立场、继续进行反革命活动、不肯撒手的家伙，是不是可以像云南盈江县那样一宽再宽一纵再纵呢？我们认为是不可以的。对于那些家伙，宽大处理只能鼓励他们继续反革命，只能鼓励他们继续去破坏我们的铁路、工厂、矿山、农业生产合作社，只能鼓励他们继续杀人，这样，人民的安全和国家的社会主义建设就会得不到保障。人民群众是绝对不会拥护这种作法的。他们会指责党和人民政府又犯了“宽大无边”的错误。这样，党和人民政府就有脱离群众的危险。关于这一点，我们在解放初期在某些地区是有过历史教训的。只有从严惩处这些胆敢继续进行破坏活动的现行反革命分子，才能使那些顽固的死硬的反革命分子有所畏惧，不敢继续作恶；使那些已在犹豫动摇的反革命分子，下决心走上自新之路，促进反革命分子的进一步分化。也只有实行这种政策，才能保护人民群众的除奸热情和政治积极性，使党和人民政府在除奸反特斗争中得到人民群众的支持。
    但是，我们仍要说明，我们要从严处理的，只是前面所说的少数死不回头的反革命分子，并不包括多数愿意坦白自首、重新作人的分子。对于一切已经看到了光明前途、不愿意再跟着帝国主义和他们的走狗进坟墓的反革命分子，我们宽大政策的门始终是敞开的。他们随时都可以向人民政府作彻底的坦白，随时都有立功赎罪、重新作人的机会。他们应该早日下定决心，不要继续犹豫了。要知道，自己不坦白，自己的罪行就终有被清算的时候，那时候后悔就来不及了。至于那些至今还在干反革命勾当的极端仇恨人民的家伙，他们的前途只有受到严厉惩办。但是，他们如果肯放下屠刀，缴械投降，人民政府还是可以从轻处理的；他们如果不投降，人民就一定要镇压他们！
