Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 21st. Chinese swimmers Mu Xiangxiong and Qi Lieyun won first and second place respectively in the men's 200m breaststroke at the international swimming competition in Budapest on August 19th.

This competition was very intense. Among the eight participants were West German athlete Bopinkaer, the 1954 European champion, and Hungarian athlete Utassi, the 1955 World Youth Festival champion. Mu Xiangxiong's breaststroke technique, which made as much use of underwater swimming as possible, showed its advantages in the competition. He won first place with a time of 2 minutes 39.4 seconds. This result was 2.6 seconds faster than the official national record held by Xu Zhixiang, and equivalent to the first-place result in the same event at last year's World Youth Festival. Mu Xiangxiong's swimming technique and results have repeatedly received praise and congratulations from athletes from various countries. Although Qi Lieyun's underwater swimming was not as good as Mu Xiangxiong's, his powerful leg kicks enabled him to win second place with a time of 2 minutes 41 seconds, also breaking Xu Zhixiang's record.

In the men's 200m freestyle competition, Lin Jinzhu finished fourth with a time of 2 minutes 12.4 seconds.
