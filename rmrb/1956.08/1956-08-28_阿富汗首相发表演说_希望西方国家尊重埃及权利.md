Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 27th - Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud said in a radio address on August 25th, celebrating Afghan Independence Day, that he hopes Western countries will respect the inalienable rights of the Egyptian people and not allow this world-significant issue of the Suez Canal to cause undesirable consequences.

Regarding Afghanistan's relations with Pakistan, he said that Afghanistan has always expressed its hope to peacefully resolve all issues through consultation. He hopes that the recent visit of Pakistani President Mirza to Afghanistan will prove to be a practical step beneficial to both countries.

He said that independence is the glory and dignity of a nation. Afghanistan's primary task is to defend Afghan territory. He announced that the National Assembly has decided to strengthen the country's defenses. In order to achieve this goal, namely procuring defense equipment, contracts have been concluded with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to purchase weapons and ammunition. These contracts have no political conditions or restrictions.

    阿富汗首相发表演说
    希望西方国家尊重埃及权利
    据新华社喀布尔27日电　阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德在8月25日庆祝阿富汗独立日发表的广播演说中说，他希望西方国家尊重埃及人民的不可剥夺的权利，不让关于苏彝士运河的这个具有世界意义的问题引起人们所不希望的后果。
    在谈到阿富汗同巴基斯坦的关系时，他说，阿富汗一向表示希望通过协商的办法和平解决所有问题。他希望，巴基斯坦总统米尔扎最近到阿富汗的访问将证明是有利于两国的实际可行的步骤。
    他说，独立是民族的光荣和尊严。阿富汗的首要任务是保卫阿富汗的领土。他宣布，国民大会已经决定要加强这个国家的防务。为了实现这个目的，即采购防务装备，已经同苏联和捷克斯洛伐克缔结了购买武器和弹药的合同。这些合同都没有任何政治条件和限制。
