Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, August 12th: The Karamay Oil City, currently under construction in the Karamay oil region, welcomed its first residents—oil workers—on August 5th. They have already moved into the first batch of completed residences in the oil city.

    The Karamay Oil City was designed by the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration. Before the arrival of winter this year, this emerging industrial town will also construct more than sixty residential buildings, with a total construction area of over 50,000 square meters. The city's long-term plan includes industrial, residential, and administrative welfare management areas. Between the industrial and residential areas, a green belt of 80 meters wide will also be constructed.

    The cultural area will be built in the middle of the residential area. Here, tall office buildings for the mining area, a workers' cultural palace, and sports fields including a skating rink will be built. There will also be an open-air cinema, an open-air dance floor, schools, and nurseries. According to the plan, neat rows of residences will be built at both ends of the cultural area. In the center of every fifty residences, a 2,000-square-meter trade outlet including general merchandise, food, and canteens to supply employees' daily necessities will be built. A staff hospital will also be constructed on the northwest side of the residential area.

    Next year, the construction area here will be many times larger than this year. After these projects are completed, a preliminary-scale oil city will appear on the desolate Gobi desert.

    一座新的石油城正在兴建
    新华社克拉玛依12日电　正在克拉玛依油区兴建的克拉玛依石油城，在八月五日接待了来到这里的第一批居民——石油工人。他们已经住进了石油城里第一批竣工的住宅。
    克拉玛依石油城是新疆石油管理局设计的。这座新兴工业城镇在今年寒冬降临之前，还将兴建六十多幢住宅，建筑面积共约五万多平方公尺。这个城市的远景规划将建有工业区、住宅区和行政福利管理区等。在工业区和住宅区之间，还将建设一条八十公尺宽的长形林带的绿化区。
    文化区将建设在住宅区中间。这里将要建筑起高大的矿区办公大楼、工人文化宫和包括滑冰场在内的运动场，还要建设露天电影院、露天舞场、学校、托儿所。文化区两端按规划将建设一幢幢整齐的住宅，每五十幢住宅的中央还要建设两千平方公尺大的包括百货、食品、食堂等供应职工生活日用品的贸易门市部。在住宅区的西北边，还将建设一座职工医院。
    明年，这里的建筑面积将比今年扩大好多倍。这些工程完工后，荒漠的戈壁上将出现一座初具规模的石油城。
