Petroleum No. 7 Factory's Pioneering Achievement
	Refining High-Grade Lubricating Oil from Inferior Petroleum
(Our newspaper's Dalian dispatch, 3rd) Petroleum No. 7 Factory recently refined thirty-grade turbine oil of very good quality from inferior petroleum for the first time. This is the result of long-term research by Zhang Fangjian, academic committee member of the Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and acting chief engineer of Petroleum No. 7 Factory, Zhu Jingxian, deputy director of the factory's research office, and many other engineering and technical personnel. Thirty-grade turbine oil is a high-grade lubricating oil. It can be used as a lubricating oil for power-generating turbine engines that rotate at 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions per minute. According to existing technical theoretical data from several countries, the manufacture of thirty-grade turbine oil mostly uses higher quality petroleum as raw material, and uses sulfuric acid, alkali, and white clay treatment methods for refining.

	In the second half of last year, this factory used petroleum produced in the Second Baku region of the Soviet Union to trial-produce thirty-grade turbine oil. Because this petroleum has a high sulfur content and low quality, the refined turbine oil contained more sediment, and oil and water could not be separated, so the quality was not up to standard. The engineering and technical personnel of this factory were not bound by existing technical theories, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, they began to look for new refining methods. After dozens of studies by Zhang Fangjian, Zhu Jingxian, and others, they finally developed a new refining method of "furfural white clay catalytic reforming" based on the characteristics of the raw material oil. Using this new method, the thirty-grade turbine oil refined by this factory from inferior petroleum not only met national standards in terms of quality, but also could extract about 70% of turbine oil from the raw material oil. After research by the Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it was considered that the use of this new refining method to refine thirty-grade turbine oil from inferior petroleum was a new pioneering achievement. It has created conditions for refining more good oil from inferior petroleum in the future.

    石油七厂炼油的创举
    从劣等石油中炼出高级润滑油
    本报大连3日电　石油七厂最近第一次从劣等石油中精炼出质量很好的三十号透平油。这是中国科学院石油研究所学术委员、石油七厂的代理总工程师张芳謇和这个厂的研究室副主任朱敬贤等许多工程技术人员，经过长期努力研究出来的。三十号透平油是一种高级润滑油。它可供每分钟运转二千转到三千转的发电透平机作润滑油用。根据几个国家现有的技术理论资料的记载，制造三十号透平油，大部都是使用质量较好的石油作原料，采用硫酸、碱、白土处理的方法来提炼。
    去年下半年，这个厂利用苏联第二巴库出产的石油来试制三十号透平油，因为这种石油所含有的硫分多、质量低，所以提炼出来的透平油里所含的沉淀物较多，油和水分也分离不开，质量不合格。这个厂的工程技术人员没有被已有的技术理论所束缚，他们在苏联专家的指导下开始寻找新的炼油方法。经过张芳謇和朱敬贤等人数十次的研究，终于根据原料油的特点，研究出了采用“糠醛白土催化改质”的新的炼油法。利用这种新的方法，这个厂从劣等石油中炼出的三十号透平油不仅质量达到国家指标，而且可以从原料油中提炼出70％左右的透平油。经过中国科学院石油研究所的研究，认为采用这种新的炼油法从劣等石油中精炼出三十号透平油，是个新的创举。它为今后从劣等石油中提炼出更多的好油创造了条件。
