In Tianjin's state-owned factories, along with the yearly increase in labor productivity, workers' wages have also been increasing year by year. Before this wage reform, the average wage of workers had increased by 30% compared to 1950, and workers' lives had generally improved. According to a survey conducted by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in the second quarter of this year, only 5% of workers in the city had financial difficulties, and about 10% needed subsidies when they encountered major events. Now, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and relevant departments are taking measures to "cover" the 5% of workers who have financial difficulties. But what about the 10% of workers?

The reporter visited the local state-owned Rubber Factory No. 2. The wage reform in this factory had just ended, with 90% of the workers receiving a wage increase, and 35% being promoted to a higher grade. In the factory's wage department, the reporter found the lists of workers who needed regular subsidies due to major events or having many children, as well as the comparison table of these workers' newly assessed wages and original wages. Comparing them, out of fifteen workers, fourteen had increased wages, and one retained the original wage. Among the fourteen workers who had increased wages, eight increased their monthly wages by more than the amount of monthly subsidies they received in the past; four increased their wages by one to three yuan less than the subsidies; two differed by five to eight yuan. It can be seen that after this wage reform, the number of workers with financial difficulties has decreased.

So, what exactly has this wage reform brought to these workers? The reporter visited Li Lianzhi, a maintenance worker in the tire workshop. He is forty-one years old, a sixth-grade fitter, and originally earned sixty-four yuan per month, supporting his wife and six children. He and his wife roughly calculated their expenses. The biggest expense was food, averaging 285 jin of grain per month (about a quarter of which was fine grain), plus an average of five fen per person per day for vegetables, totaling at least forty yuan. In addition, rent, utilities, and coal costs ten yuan; three children in school need three yuan for stationery; Li Lianzhi needs four yuan for breakfast and cigarettes every day he works. After deducting these essential expenses, the remaining money for buying sweets for the children is only a few jiao, buying soap, toothpaste, and other daily necessities is no more than one yuan. The main thing is that Li Lianzhi's wife buys some fabric scraps and thread to make shoes and mend clothes for the whole family, and occasionally buys a new piece of clothing for one of the children in school.

After calculating this, Li Lianzhi said that although life is not well-off, it is enough to feed the whole family of eight. However, whenever they need to buy some clothes or the adults and children get sick, the money is not enough. Therefore, every two or three months, when the money is tight, they need some subsidies from the trade union. In 1955, the trade union subsidized them several times, but he couldn't remember the exact number. In the first seven months of this year, they were subsidized three times, each time seven to ten yuan. With such regular subsidies, the family's life was maintained.

Then, Li Lianzhi said that the Party and the trade union take such good care of me, and I can't let them down. I must contribute more to the country in production. Last year, Li Lianzhi put forward two rationalization proposals, saving the country steel materials; this year, he has been completing the repair tasks ahead of schedule every month, and was selected as an advanced producer in the factory in both the first and second quarters. In this wage reform, he was promoted from a sixth-grade worker to a seventh-grade worker, and with the difference in the new wage standard, his monthly wage increased to eighty-five yuan, twenty-one yuan more than before the reform.

The benefits this brought to Li Lianzhi are significant. On the 22nd, the reporter visited his home, which was his first day off after receiving his back pay. He happily bought a pair of rubber shoes for his eldest son in the morning, and also bought two new schoolbags for the other two children who are in school. He said: Now three children are in school, and in September, a fourth child will be in school. Today, I also bought him a new schoolbag. His wife also said: A few days ago, I was worried that with four children in school, life would be even tighter, but now that the wages are higher, I feel much happier.

Li Lianzhi pointed to the children sitting on the windowsill and said: I often tell them that they are really living in good times. When I was young, I couldn't even get enough to eat, let alone have money to go to school. When I was thirteen, I went to Tianjin as an apprentice, and suffered for four and a half years. After finally finishing my apprenticeship, I worked in an iron factory, and the money I earned was not enough to support myself. My wife and children lived in the countryside, farming a few acres of land to make a living. In 1949, I came to the factory as a temporary worker, and later became a regular worker. At first, I didn't even have a place to live, and I built a shack out of sorghum stalks in the suburbs to live in for two years. In 1952, I moved into the factory's dormitory. In recent years, my wages have increased, three of my older children have gone to school, the whole family lives in an apartment building, we are not cold or hungry, and the factory has implemented labor protection regulations, and the trade union provides subsidies when we have difficulties. This time, my wages have increased again, and life is really getting better and better every day.

### 工资改革给一个普通工人带来了什么？

    工资改革给一个普通工人带来了什么？
    新华社记者　孟帆
    在天津市的国营工厂中，随着劳动生产率的逐年提高，工人的工资也是逐年增加的。到这次工资改革以前，工人的平均工资已比1950年增加了30％，工人的生活普遍地有了改善。据市工会联合会在今年第二季的调查，全市只有5％的工人生活有困难，约有10％的工人遇到重大的事情需要补助。现在，市工会联合会和有关部门正在对这5％生活有困难的工人采取包下来的办法。但那10％的工人怎么样呢？
    记者访问了地方国营橡胶二厂。这个厂的工人工资改革刚刚结束，90％的工人都在这次工资改革中增加了工资，还有35％的工人升了级。记者在这个工厂的工资科里找到了那些因重大事情或子女多需要经常补助的工人名单，也找出了这些工人这次新评定的工资和原工资的比较表。对照看来，在十五个工人中，有十四个人增加了工资，一个人保留原工资。这十四个增加工资的工人中，有八个人每月增加的工资超过了过去每月受补助的钱数；有四个人增加的工资比补助的钱少一元到三元；两个人差五元到八元。可以看出，经过这次工资改革，生活困难的工人人数是缩小了。
    那么，究竟这次工资改革给这些工人带来了什么呢？记者访问了轮胎车间的保全工人李连枝。他今年四十一岁，六级钳工，原来每月工资六十四元，妻子和六个孩子都靠他供养。他和他的妻子草略地算了一笔账。每月花费最多的是伙食，平均需要二百八十五斤粮食（约有四分之一是细粮），再加上每人每天平均五分钱的菜钱，至少要四十元。另外，房租、水电费、煤火费需要十元；有三个孩子念书买文具纸张需要三元；李连枝每天上班吃早点和吸烟需要四元。去掉这些必不可少的开销，余下的钱用来给孩子买糖果的不过几角钱，买肥皂、牙粉等日用品也不过一元，主要的是李连枝妻子买些布头、针线给全家做鞋和修补衣服，偶而也给某个上学的孩子添件新衣服。
    李连枝算了这笔账后说，这样算来生活不宽裕，也够全家八口人吃饱饭的。可是每逢要添些衣服或者大人孩子病了，钱就不够了。因此，每隔两、三个月，钱周转不过来，就需要工会补助一些。1955年工会补助了几次记不清楚了。今年前七个月补助了三次，每次七元到十元。有了这样经常的补助，全家的生活就维持下来了。
    接着，李连枝说，党和工会对我这样照顾，我也不能辜负，在生产上要多给国家出力。去年李连枝曾提出了两项合理化建议，为国家节省了钢铁材料；今年每月都提前完成修理任务，第一季和第二季都被评选为工厂的先进生产者。这次工资改革，由六级工升为七级工，加上新工资标准的差额，每月工资增加到八十五元，比改革前多二十一元。
    这带给李连枝的利益是显著的。22日，记者到他家里去访问，正是他补发工资后的第一个休假日。他早晨高兴地给最大的男孩子买了一双胶鞋，还给另外的两个正上学的孩子买了两个新书包。他说：现在三个孩子上学，到9月份又有第四个孩子上学了。今天也给他买了个新书包。他的妻子也说：前些日子我还担心四个孩子上学，生活更紧了，现在工资多了，心里也畅快了。
    李连枝指着坐在窗沿上的孩子们说：我时常对他们讲，他们真是赶上了好时候。我小的时候，饭都吃不上，那有钱念书。十三岁我到天津学徒，整整四年半，受的罪就别说了。好容易出了师，在一家铁工厂做工，挣的钱养活自己都不够。老婆和孩子在乡下种几亩地维持生活。1949年，我到工厂做了临时工，后来又转成了正式工。开头，连住处都没有，自己在市郊用高粱秸搭了个窝铺对付了两年。1952年搬到工厂的宿舍里。这几年，工资增加了，三个大孩子都上了学，全家住上了楼房，冻不着、饿不着，工厂又实行了劳保条例，有困难工会还给补助。这次又增加工资，生活真是一天比一天好起来。
