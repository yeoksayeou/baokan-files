Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 10th: The Shenyang Municipal Organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) is actively connecting with middle and upper class figures. Currently, they are in contact with over 300 middle and upper class individuals.

In the first half of this year, with the strong support of the United Front Work Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the assistance of the United Front Work Departments of various district committees, the Shenyang Municipal Organization of the RCCK gained an understanding of the basic situation of middle and upper class figures scattered across seven districts. In the second quarter, a Social Liaison Work Committee was established, assigning full-time cadres to be responsible for concrete tasks such as investigating and formulating work plans for connecting with social figures. When the provincial and municipal CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) held plenary sessions, they conducted multifaceted contacts with middle and upper class figures through activities such as networking, conversations, and small receptions. At the same time, the personal connections between members of the RCCK and social figures have also become increasingly close, and they are constantly proposing potential contacts to the RCCK organization. The Shenyang Municipal Organization of the RCCK has already organized those connected, including people from the Chinese medicine field, former military and government personnel, former intellectuals, and former financial figures, into eight study groups to help them learn. During the study, many people have come to appreciate the care and concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for them, and some have expressed their determination to invigorate themselves, abandon their "twilight mentality" of many years, and strive to learn to serve socialist construction.

    民革沈阳市组织
    广泛联系中上层社会人士
    据新华社沈阳10日电　中国国民党革命委员会沈阳市组织广泛联系中、上层社会人士。目前他们联系的中、上层社会人士有三百多人。
    中国国民党革命委员会沈阳市组织今年上半年在中共沈阳市委员会统战部的大力支持和各区区委统战部的帮助下，对散处在七个区里的中、上层社会人士的基本情况作了了解。在第二季度成立了社会联系工作委员会，调配专职干部负责调查和订立联系社会人士工作方案等具体工作。在省、市政协分别召开全体会议的时候，他们通过串连、交谈、小型招待会等方式，同社会上的中、上层人士进行了多方面的接触。同时，中国国民党革命委员会成员个人和社会人士的联系也日渐密切，他们不断地向民革组织提出可以联系的对象。中国国民党革命委员会沈阳市组织已把先后联系到的中医界人士、旧军政人员、旧知识分子、旧金融界人士等组成了八个学习小组，帮助他们进行学习。在学习中许多人体会到中国共产党和人民政府对他们的关怀，有的表示要振作起来，丢掉多年来的“黄昏思想”，努力学习为社会主义建设服务。
