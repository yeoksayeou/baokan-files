    Don't Be a Protector of Waste and Defective Products
    Lu Cun
    Currently, in some factories, the amount of waste and defective products is quite high. One of the important reasons is that they are protected by some enterprise leaders.
    At the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant, the following incident occurred: Inspector Yang Weiqin discovered air holes and shrinkage cavities in the cylinder liner of a locomotive during a product quality inspection, and notified the workshop to scrap it. However, Deputy Director Liu Wei disagreed and said to Yang Weiqin, "Does your inspection department have a special interest in scrapping this cylinder liner? You treat the workshop as if it were a foreign country." As a result, Yang Weiqin had to obey the director's "decision" and passed this piece of waste. This phenomenon of using the director's authority to lower quality standards is not unique. A water turbine cover produced by the foundry workshop of the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant was eight centimeters different from the drawing. The technical inspection department, with the approval of the factory leaders, treated it as waste. After the waste notice was sent to the foundry workshop, the workshop director, Wang Shunguo, went to the factory director to complain: "One cover weighs more than two tons. How can we complete the task if it is scrapped? If castings can't be produced, the machining workshop will stop working, don't blame us!" The factory director, hearing that work would stop and the output value plan would be threatened, agreed to reconsider the decision. As expected, after the factory director Cong Rong and the chief engineer Fang Hanpei inspected the site, they echoed the workshop director's words, and they said to Tu Zhongmo, the head of the technical inspection department, "Our decision just now was a bit too strict. Although the cover is off by a few centimeters, let's treat it as a qualified product this time. You shouldn't just focus on supervision and inspection, but also consider the plant's overall national plan!"
    Of course, such open phenomena of protecting waste and defective products to "pass" are ultimately not many. A more common phenomenon is that many enterprise leaders adopt the method of "one eye open, one eye closed." When arranging and inspecting work, many enterprise leaders often do not say a word about quality issues. When waste and defective products appear, they do not actively analyze the reasons, investigate responsibilities, or try to improve.
    Of course, we cannot say that these comrades particularly love waste and defective products or have "any special interest" in them. When they let waste and defective products "pass," they have many high-sounding reasons. For example, "in order to complete the national output value plan," "for the honor of the enterprise," and so on. As a result, waste and defective products have become rampant, and rework waste is very serious, so that the national plan has not been fully completed for a considerable period of time, and some have not even completed the output value plan. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant alone suffered losses of nearly 260,000 yuan due to waste products in the first quarter of this year, and one-third (sets) of the locomotives leaving the factory still needed to be repaired. The national plan was not completed every month in the first half of this year. More seriously, waste and defective products not only wreak havoc in this factory, but also harm consumers and other enterprises. Of the locomotives produced by the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant last year, 68.2% had stopped running for repairs from the time they left the factory until the end of the first quarter of this year. If each locomotive runs 400 kilometers a day and transports more than 1,800 tons of grain, the Ministry of Railways will lose more than 11,000 yuan in freight revenue alone. As for the "honor" pursued by these factories, it has been shattered with the proliferation of waste and defective products. What they have received are accusations from consumers and product-using units, and criticism from leading authorities.
    I advise these comrades to quickly correct their ideological understanding and stop being protectors of waste and defective products!

    莫当废品、次品的保护人
    路村
    目前，在某些工厂里，废品、次品相当多。重要原因之一，是它们受到了一些企业领导人员的保护。
    在大连机车车辆制造厂发生过这样一件事情：检查员杨维勤在检查产品质量的时候，发现一辆机车上的汽缸套有气孔和缩孔，就通知车间报废。可是，副厂长刘伟不同意，对杨维勤说：“你们检查科对这个汽缸套报废有什么特别的兴趣吗？你们把车间好像看成是别的国家似的。”这样，杨维勤只好服从厂长的“决定”，通过了这件废品。这种利用厂长职权降低质量标准的现象，还不是仅有的。重庆柴油机厂铸工车间生产的一个水轮机机罩比图纸差了八糎，技术检查科经过工厂领导批准把它当作废品处理了。当废品通知单送到铸工车间以后，车间主任王顺国却去找厂长诉起苦来：“一个机罩就是两吨多重，报废了怎能完成任务？铸件出不来，加工车间停工可不要怨我们！”厂长听说要停工，产值计划受到威胁，便答应重新考虑这个决定。果然，当厂长丛戎和总工程师方汉培到工场实地察看以后，也和车间主任的话头一样了，他们对技术检查科科长涂仲模说：“我们刚才决定的有些太严格了，机罩虽然错了几个糎，但是这次还是当合格品处理吧。你们也不要只扣住监督检查，还应该考虑全厂的国家计划呀！”
    当然，像这种公开保护废品、次品“过关”的现象，终究是不多的。更加普遍的现象，是许多企业领导人员采取了“睁一只眼，闭一只眼”的办法。许多企业领导人员在布置工作、检查工作的时候，常常对于质量问题不置一词。出了废品、次品，不积极分析原因，追究责任，设法改进。
    我们当然不能说，这些同志就特别喜爱废品、次品，对废品、次品“有什么特别的兴趣”。他们在让废品、次品“过关”的时候，是有许多冠冕堂皇的理由的。例如：“为了完成国家产值计划”、“为了企业的荣誉”等等。结果，却使废品、次品泛滥起来，返工浪费非常严重，以致在相当长的时间内没有全面完成国家计划，有的甚至连产值计划也没有完成。大连机车车辆制造厂仅今年第一季度因废品造成的损失，就将近二十六万元，出厂的机车还有三分之一（台份）需要返修，今年上半年月月都没有完成国家计划。更严重的是，废品、次品不仅在本厂为非作恶，还要祸及消费者和其他企业。大连机车车辆制造工厂去年生产的机车，从出厂起到今年第一季度末止，就有68.2％曾停止行驶进行返修。如果按每台机车每天跑四百公里，运粮一千八百多吨计算，仅运费收入就使铁道部损失一万一千多元。至于这些厂追求的“荣誉”，却随着废品、次品的泛滥而破灭了。得到的，却是消费者、使用产品单位的指责和领导机关的批评。
    奉劝这些同志，赶快端正思想认识，不要再当废品、次品的保护人了！
