　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th - Currently, agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu Province are simultaneously harvesting autumn crops and sowing late autumn crops such as mung beans, buckwheat, and carrots. According to statistics, various regions plan to sow three million mu of late autumn crops, striving for an extra harvest to compensate for typhoon losses.

　　When the typhoon struck, the already ripe early rice and the heading mid-season rice in various agricultural cooperatives generally experienced shattering and lodging, suffering varying degrees of damage. However, the collective farmers were not intimidated by the disaster. After the typhoon, they devised many ways to make up for the losses. Some cooperatives harvested autumn crops while simultaneously collecting late autumn seeds. After the early rice harvest in the Songjiang and Yangzhou regions, members immediately tilled the land and sowed mung beans and buckwheat, and aquatic crops such as arrowhead in flooded fields. The small Chinese cabbage seeds sown by agricultural cooperatives near the cities have already sprouted, a lush green. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yancheng County calculated the income from late autumn crops, finding that it could not only compensate for typhoon losses but also increase income by more than 2,000 yuan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 15th - Repair work is in full swing on the Nanzhuang seawall in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, which was hit by the typhoon.

　　This Nanzhuang seawall, which is fourteen li long, was almost entirely damaged in this strong typhoon. In order to prepare for the approaching mid-July (lunar calendar) high tide and protect the safety of 40,000 people and 60,000 mu of land, the Xiangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xiangshan County People's Committee immediately formed a seawall water conservancy project repair headquarters to repair the seawall and planned to generally raise it by 30 centimeters above its original height.

　　Lin Hai, Nanzhuang and other townships benefiting from the Nanzhuang seawall were severely affected by the disaster, and the victims urgently needed to carry out rescue material and other work, so they did not participate in the repair of the seawall. The 4,000 laborers participating in the seawall repair were all from other townships and towns in Xiangshan County who came to support. Many laborers came from 70 or 80 li away, bringing their own dike repair tools and food and lodging supplies.

　　A large number of water conservancy engineering technicians and medical staff from Hangzhou and Dinghai also rushed to the construction site to provide services.

　　The seawall repair work began on the 11th and is progressing extremely rapidly. According to the Seawall Water Conservancy Project Repair Headquarters, it is estimated that the repair will be completed by the 18th.

    争取多收一熟弥补台灾损失
    浙江象山县抢修被台风破坏的南庄海塘
    新华社南京15日电　目前，江苏省各地农业社正在一边收割秋庄稼一边播种绿豆、荞麦、胡萝卜等晚秋作物。据统计，各地计划播种晚秋作物三百万亩，争取多收一熟，以弥补台灾损失。
    台风袭来时，各地农业社已经黄熟的早稻和正在抽穗的中稻普遍脱粒和倒伏，遭受了不同程度的损失。但是，集体农民们没有被灾害吓倒，台风过后，他们想出很多弥补损失的办法。有的社一边收秋一边收集晚秋的种子，松江、扬州专区早稻收割后，社员马上耕地，播种绿豆和荞麦，有水的田播种茨菇等水生作物。靠近城市的农业社撒下的小白菜子，已经出土，绿油油一片。盐城县五星农业社算了一笔晚秋作物收入账，不但可以弥补台灾损失，还可以增加收入二千多元。
    新华社杭州15日电　遭受台风袭击的浙江省象山县南庄海塘，抢修工作正在全面紧张进行。
    这条全长十四里的南庄海塘，在这次强台风袭击下，几乎全部遭受破坏。为了准备防御即将到来的农历七月半大潮，保卫四万人口和六万亩土地的安全，在台风过境以后，中共象山县委员会和象山县人民委员会就立即组成海塘水利工程抢修指挥部，抢修这条海塘，并且计划在原有高度上普遍加高三十公分。
    南庄海塘受益的林海、南庄等乡这次因为受灾严重，灾民急需进行抢救物资等工作，没有参加抢修海塘的工作。参加抢修海塘的四千个民工全部是由象山县的其他乡、镇赶来支援的。很多民工来自七十里或八十里以外，他们自带修堤工具和吃住用具。
    在杭州、定海的大批水利工程技术人员、医务工作人员也纷纷赶到工地服务。
    抢修海塘工作自十一日开始，进展极为迅速。据海塘水利工程抢修指挥部估计，到十八日就可抢修完毕。
