Title: On "Turning Away"

    People usually adopt the method of "glancing sideways" or "listening askance" to things they are unwilling to hear or see. The specific action is "turning away."

    There is much to be said about this "turning away." Analyzing it, there are four main points: First, it means I am not completely not listening (or watching). If the other party asks something, I can quickly turn my face back and find a way to respond. Second, it means I don't really want to listen (or watch). If the other party understands my meaning and no longer insists that I listen (or watch), then I can step down from this situation. It is truly a case of speaking or not speaking is up to you, listening or not listening is up to me, and each has their own convenience. Third, it means pretending not to have heard (or seen). If the other party asks something, I can feign ignorance, and of course, I can't be blamed. Fourth, it means pretending to have heard (or seen), but not clearly, and still needing to listen (or watch). If the clueless other party still wants to ask something, then I can adopt the first method.

    This is called "the wonderful application lies in one's heart." If everyone does not adopt the "turning away" method to the above words, please continue to listen (or watch), there is evidence to prove it.

    On the priority seats for pregnant women on the bus, a couple of strong middle-aged people were chatting and laughing. The conductor shouted, "Who will give up their seat for the pregnant woman?" There seemed to be some commotion in the crowd, but it soon calmed down due to the bumps of the bus, leaving only the conductor's shouting vibrating in the air. No sooner said than done, the couple on the priority seats immediately turned away, talking even more enthusiastically than before. It seemed that it was indeed difficult to hear what others were saying. But the conductor changed the method, probably estimating that they couldn't hear, so he simply pulled on the talker's clothes, said "Give up your seat," and pointed to the pregnant woman next to him. But the talker was too engrossed and overly focused, and didn't even feel someone pulling him. The conductor had to shout loudly. So, one of them meaningfully "ah"-ed and gave up the seat. The remaining one soon encountered the same situation. The conductor changed his wording: "Which young comrade will give up their seat?" But he turned his face even more severely. Fortunately, the passenger next to him was very understanding and gave up the seat to the pregnant woman, and the problem was satisfactorily resolved.

    These two kinds of turning away each have their own merits, belonging to the first two of the four situations mentioned earlier. As for the latter two, I have no examples to cite. But citing or not citing is the same, because when the so-called four major points are combined with this specific practice, it ultimately boils down to one sentence: "I want to sit a little longer."

    For some people, mentioning these small things may seem trivial. But "sitting a little longer" is not a big deal either, so why don't some people think it's trivial? The reason is very simple, it's "me" who wants to "sit a little longer." This is called striving for every advantage, not letting go when "me" is involved. Extending this meaning, it is not necessarily trivial. It can be said that these people can focus on the big picture and talk about socialism every day, but they are not good at starting with the small things. Compared with the ancient Kong Rong, who was willing to give the bigger pear to others at the age of four, they are still slightly inferior in this regard.

    Our new social atmosphere and civic morality are gradually being established. There are countless examples of respecting the old and cherishing the young, caring for the sick and weak, and people with special physical conditions. But there are also some individual special people who often forget their civic morality and social responsibility for the sake of "me," "a little while," etc., and explain that they just didn't pay attention in small matters, but in fact "I" know what's going on in my heart. The four major meanings of "turning away" are precisely the despicable philistine psychology that is beneficial to "me."

    论“转过脸去”
    朱芃
    人们对于自己不愿意听或不愿意看的事情，据说，通常是采取“侧目而视”或“侧耳而听”的办法，具体动作就是“转过脸去”。
    这“转过脸去”大有文章。分析一下，要义有四：一曰我并非不在听（或看），如果对方问什么，很快就可以把脸转过去，找出应对的办法；二曰我并非真想听（或看），如果对方领会我的意思，不再坚持要我听（或看），那就可以就此下台，真所谓讲不讲在你，听不听由我，各有各的方便；三曰假装没听（或看）见，如果对方问什么，佯推不知，那当然怪不得我；四曰假装听（或看）见了，但没听（或看）清楚，还需要听（或看），如果不识时务的对方还要问什么，那就可以采用第一条的办法。
    这叫做“运用之妙，存乎一心”。如果大家对以上的话不采取“转过脸去”的办法的话，请继续听（或看）下去，有事实为证。
    公共汽车的孕妇专座上，一对身强力壮的中年人在谈笑风生。售票员高喊着：“哪位给孕妇让个座？”人丛中好像有点骚动，但不久就因车子的颠簸而平静下来，只剩下售票员的喊声在空气中振动。说时迟，那时快，孕妇专座上的一对，马上转过脸去，话谈得比以前还热烈一些，看样子，确实很难听见别人的话。但售票员改了办法，大概估计到他们听不见，索性就拉一拉谈话者的衣服，说一声“让个座”，指着旁边的那位孕妇，但谈话者兴致太浓，精神过分贯注，居然没感到有人拉他，售票员不得不大声叫了起来。于是，其中一位就意味深长地“啊”了一声，把座位让出来了。剩下的一位不久又遇到同样的情况，售票员改了说法：“哪位年青同志给让个座？”但他却脸转得更厉害一些，幸亏邻座的乘客很知趣，把座位让给了孕妇，问题算是圆满地解决了。
    这两种转过脸去各有千秋，属于前面提到的四种情况中的前两种；至于后两种，我还没有实例可举。但举不举都是一样，因为所谓四大要义同这个具体实践相结合时，归根结底不过一句话：“我多坐一会儿”而已。
    对于有些人，提起这些小事也许失之琐碎。但“多坐一会儿”却也不是大事，还有些人为什么就不嫌琐碎呢？原因很简单，要“多坐一会儿”的是“我”罢了。这叫做遇利必争，有“我”不让。把这意义推广一下，却未必是琐碎的。要说这些人们能大处着眼，天天讲社会主义，但却不善于小处着手。比起在四岁时就愿意把大梨让给别人吃的古人孔融，在这一点上，还是稍逊一筹的。
    我们新的社会风气、公民道德是逐渐建立起来了，尊老惜幼，爱护病弱及身体有特殊情况的人，那实例是举不胜举的。但也有些个别的特殊的人，常常为了“我”、“一会儿”等等忘记了自己的公民道德和社会责任，而解释自己不过是小地方没注意，其实“我”的心里是明白的。那“转过脸去”的四大意义正是有利于“我”的可鄙的市侩心理。
