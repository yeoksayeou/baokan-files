Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 29th. Farmers in the major cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province, such as Heze and Liaocheng, have recently begun harvesting new cotton. In the northern Huimin area and the eastern regions, cotton will also begin to bloom in three to five days.

This year, the more than 12 million mu of cotton in Shandong Province is growing very well. The cotton already harvested in 19 counties, including Gaotang and Xiajin, has long fibers, strong tensile strength, and a high ginning outturn (the percentage of lint cotton obtained from seed cotton). Generally, each mu can produce more than 64 jin of lint cotton. According to preliminary estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, if the frost season does not arrive early in the autumn, the average cotton yield per mu throughout the province can increase by about 20% compared to last year.

    山东开始采摘新棉可望比去年增产
    新华社济南29日电　山东省主要产棉区菏泽、聊城等专区的农民，最近几天来已经先后开始采摘新棉。北部惠民专区和东部地区的棉花，再过三五天也可以绽桃吐絮。
    今年山东省一千二百多万亩棉花生长很好。高唐、夏津等十九个县已经采摘的棉花，纤维长、拉力强、衣分率（籽棉轧成皮棉的百分率）高，一般每亩可以产皮棉六十四斤以上。据省农业厅初步估计，如果秋季霜期不提早到来，全省平均每亩棉花可以比去年增产两成左右。
