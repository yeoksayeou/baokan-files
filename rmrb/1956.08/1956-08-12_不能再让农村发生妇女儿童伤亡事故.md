    No More Casualties Among Women and Children in Rural Areas
    Commentator of this newspaper

    This newspaper published an editorial on May 16th regarding the protection of the health and safety of women and children in rural areas. The editorial commented on the erroneous thinking and practices of some rural cadres who neglected the special interests of working women, in light of the casualties among women and children in rural areas. Judging from the feedback from various regions, many areas have already attached importance to the issue of protecting women's labor; however, there are still some areas that have not paid attention to this issue, and casualties among women and children continue to occur.

    According to the Sichuan Provincial Women's Federation, seven out of twelve pregnant female members of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Tongnan County had miscarriages during the spring harvest. In the Dongyun Agricultural Cooperative in Chengkou County, five pregnant women had miscarriages, three of whom miscarried in the fields. According to a survey of 49 counties in Sichuan Province, all counties have seen deaths of children due to lack of care since the beginning of spring. According to recent incomplete statistics from the Wuqing County Women's Federation in Hebei Province, from the spring sowing to the wheat harvest, 28 female members fell ill due to overwork, some were injured by doing inappropriate heavy work, and six pregnant women had miscarriages due to overwork.

    Many leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives say: if we have to take care of women in this way and that way, how can we complete the production tasks? Some people are afraid of being criticized for not completing the production plan, so they demand that members work more hours and increase the intensity of labor, regardless of everything else. The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xianhe Township, Leshan County, Sichuan Province, requires female members to work 25 days a month. To achieve this goal, they conduct monthly evaluations and launch labor competitions to see who works the most. Some cooperatives also stipulate that women who do not work will have their earned workdays deducted, and workdays will also be deducted for returning to their parents' home after the permitted time. When arranging farm work, they also do not take into account women's physical strength. For example, the Liangguantun Agricultural Cooperative in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, assigned the pregnant woman Wu Guizhen to carry water to irrigate wheat, which exhausted her to the point of miscarriage. Originally, after the upsurge of cooperativization, especially in places where advanced cooperativization has been realized, many women, in order to earn more work points, were already working desperately regardless of their physical strength. If agricultural cooperatives make excessive demands on women's work and use inappropriate encouragement or force them to work, it will further encourage women's tendency to risk their lives to earn work points, and casualties will naturally be difficult to avoid.

    This year, farmers have particularly high enthusiasm for production, and the production tasks are also greater than in any previous year. During the busy farming season, labor is even more intense. If women do not participate in production labor, many production tasks cannot be completed in a timely manner. It is a good phenomenon that the leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives attach importance to completing production tasks and encourage women to work more. However, it is wrong to put the completion of production tasks in opposition to the protection of women's labor and to adopt inappropriate methods to encourage or force women to work. Precisely because production tasks cannot be completed in a timely manner without women's labor, we should pay special attention to helping women solve special problems such as doing housework and taking care of children, and allocate farm work according to women's physiological characteristics. Only in this way can they participate in production labor with peace of mind and pleasure, and only in this way can they maintain their enthusiasm for labor. Production labor is not just a matter of one or two days, or three or two months, but a lifelong career for every worker. The health of workers is not easily restored if it is damaged, and death is an irretrievable loss. We run cooperatives and develop production not for anything else, but precisely to make people live happy lives. If women's health is damaged, not only will the production tasks fail, but it will also destroy the happiness of women themselves and the happiness of farmers' families. What is the point of that!

    Of course, solving women's special problems and rationally arranging women's labor will encounter many practical difficulties. This requires comrades who work in rural areas to help agricultural cooperative cadres come up with ideas and find solutions, and requires rural workers and leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives to jointly shoulder the responsibility of protecting the health and safety of women and children.

    Some cadres of agricultural cooperatives mistakenly call on female members to work "from dawn till dusk" without giving them time for housework.

### 不能再让农村发生妇女儿童伤亡事故

    不能再让农村发生妇女儿童伤亡事故
    本报评论员
    本报在五月十六日发表过一篇关于保护农村妇女儿童的健康和安全的社论，就农村中发生的妇女儿童伤亡事故，评论了某些农村干部忽视照顾劳动妇女特殊利益的错误思想和作法。从各地反映的情况看来，许多地区已经重视保护妇女劳动的问题；但是，也还有一些地区，对这个问题没有加以重视，妇女儿童伤亡事故还在陆续发生。
    据四川省民主妇女联合会反映：潼南县前进农业社怀孕的女社员十二人，在收割小春的期间，竟有七人小产。城口县东云农业社有五个孕妇小产，其中三人是小产在地头上的。据四川省四十九个县的调查，入春以来，农村儿童因无人照管发生死亡事故的现象各县都有。据河北省武清县民主妇女联合会最近的不完全统计，从春播到麦收这段期间，全县有二十八个女社员因劳累过度而生病，有人作了不适当的重活而受伤，有六名孕妇因为劳累过度流产了。
    许多农业社的领导干部说：妇女这也要照顾，那也要照顾，生产任务怎样完成呢？有些人怕完不成生产计划受批评，就不顾一切地要求社员多出工，加大劳动强度。四川省乐山县仙鹤乡红星农业社要求女社员每月出工二十五天。为了实现这个要求，规定月月进行评比，开展劳动竞赛，看谁出工最多。有些社还规定妇女不出工要扣已经得到的劳动日，回娘家过期不回来也要扣劳动日。在安排农活的时候，也不照顾妇女体力。像河北省武清县良官屯农业社派孕妇吴桂珍挑水浇麦，就把吴桂珍累的流产了。本来，在合作化高潮出现以后，特别是实现了高级合作化的地方，许多妇女为了多劳动得工分，已经是不顾体力地拚命劳动；农业社对妇女出工再作过高的要求，并以开展竞赛等等方式进行不适当的鼓励，就会更加助长妇女拚了命挣工分的偏向，伤亡事故自然就难于避免了。
    今年农民的生产情绪特别高，生产任务也比以往任何一年都大；在农忙时期，劳动更加紧张，如果没有妇女参加生产劳动，许多生产任务确实不能及时完成。农业社的领导干部重视完成生产任务，注意鼓励妇女多出工，应该说是很好的现象。但是，把完成生产任务和保护妇女劳动对立起来，采取不适当的方式鼓励或强制妇女劳动，那就不对了。正因为缺少妇女劳动就不能及时完成生产任务，那就更应该特别注意帮助妇女解决做家事、带孩子等特殊问题，根据妇女的生理特点分配农活。只有这样，才能够使她们安心地、愉快地参加生产劳动，才能够经常保持她们的劳动积极性。生产劳动不只是一天两天、三月两月的事，而是每个劳动者毕生的事业。劳动者的健康受到损害是不容易恢复的，死亡更是无法挽回的损失。我们办合作社、发展生产不是为了别的，正是为了使人们过幸福的生活。如果使妇女的健康受到损失，那就不仅生产任务要落空，而且会破坏妇女本身的幸福和农民家庭生活的幸福；这是所为何来！
    当然，要解决妇女的特殊问题，合理安排妇女劳动，是会碰到许多实际困难的。这就需要做农村工作的同志帮助农业社干部出主意，想办法，需要农村工作人员和农业社的领导干部一起，把保护妇女儿童的健康和安全的责任担当起来。
    晚归苏光
    有些农业社的干部，错误的号召女社员“披星戴月”地工作，不给她们以家务劳动的时间。
