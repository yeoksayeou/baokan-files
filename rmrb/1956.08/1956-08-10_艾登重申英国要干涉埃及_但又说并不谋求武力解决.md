Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from London: British Prime Minister Eden, on August 8th, delivered a broadcast speech on the Suez Canal issue, reiterating the British government's intention to intervene in Egypt's measure to nationalize the Suez Canal.

Eden said that Egypt's seizure of the Suez Canal was an act of robbery, threatening to weaken all countries in the world. In his speech, Eden used words like "dictator" and "fascism" to attack Nasser.

Eden said that the Suez Canal "certainly flows through Egypt, but it is not as vitally related to Egypt as it is to other countries around the world." He said, "This canal has always been a major artery connecting the Commonwealth and bringing us (Britain) essential supplies."

Eden tried his best to stir up anti-Egyptian sentiment among the British people. He said: "This is a matter of life and death for us all... This is a matter that concerns every family in our country, and not just our country."

Eden focused his attack on Nasser alone. He described Nasser as a "dictator" and said, "We are not arguing with Egypt, let alone with the Arab world, but with Colonel Nasser."

Eden said that he could not believe Egyptian President Nasser's assurances about the freedom of navigation on the canal, because Nasser's record proved that he was not a person worthy of trust. He described Egypt's measures to take back the canal company as the practice of a fascist government, and Egypt's plan to use part of the company's income to build the Aswan Dam as a "plan to seize the assets of international companies to promote its own national plans." Eden further said: "If Colonel Nasser's actions succeed, then every one of our countries will be at the mercy of one person in order to obtain the supplies we depend on for our livelihood. We absolutely cannot accept this."

Eden said that the purpose of the three Western powers in initiating this conference was to establish an "international organization" to manage the Suez Canal. He expressed his belief that this conference would be able to formulate a "workable plan" within "the limits I have explained."

Eden concluded by saying: "We are not seeking a solution by force, but seeking the broadest international agreement." But he also emphasized the existence of "danger" and therefore "cannot but take precautions." He said that this is "the meaning of the activities of the British 'Army, Navy, and Air Force' in the past few days."

### 艾登重申英国要干涉埃及  但又说并不谋求武力解决

    艾登重申英国要干涉埃及
    但又说并不谋求武力解决
    新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登八月八日就苏彝士运河问题发表广播演说，重申英国政府要干涉埃及把苏彝士运河收归国有的措施。
    艾登说，埃及夺取苏彝士运河是一种抢劫行为，它威胁着要削弱世界各国。艾登在演说中用“独裁者”和“法西斯主义”这样的字眼攻击纳赛尔。
    艾登说，苏彝士运河“诚然是流过埃及的，但是它对埃及并不像它对世界各地的其他国家那样有切身关系”。他说，“这条运河始终是接连英联邦并且是把我们（英国）必需的物资带给我们的大动脉”。
    艾登竭力想挑动英国人民的反埃及的情绪。他说：“这对我们全体是一个生死问题……这是关系到我国而且不仅是我国的每一个家庭的事情。”
    艾登把攻击集中于纳赛尔一人。他把纳赛尔说成是“独裁者”，并且说，“我们不是同埃及争执，更不同阿拉伯世界争执，而是同纳赛尔中校争执。”
    艾登说，他不能相信埃及总统纳赛尔关于运河通航自由的保证，因为纳赛尔的纪录证明它不是一个足以被人信任的人。他把埃及收回运河公司的措施说成是法西斯政府的作法，把埃及要把这个公司的部分收入用来建设阿斯旺水坝的计划说成是“夺取国际公司的资财来促进自己国家的计划”。艾登进一步说：“如果纳赛尔中校的行动获得成功，那么，我们每一个国家为了取得我们赖以生活的供应就都要听任一个人支配了。我们绝对不能够接受这一点。”
    艾登说，西方三国发起这个会议的目的，是要设立一个管理苏彝士运河的“国际机构”。他表示相信这个会议能够在他“所解释的限度之内”来制定一项“行得通的计划”。
    艾登最后说：“我们并不是谋求以武力来解决，而是谋求最广泛的国际协议。”但是他又强调存在着“危险”，因而“不能不进行预防”。他说，这就是过去几天中英国“陆、海、空三军的活动的意义。”
