Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, August 4th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Bingjian reports: The material and cultural lives of the dozens of field exploration teams of the Yumen Oil Mine, which are conducting petroleum geological exploration in the Jiuquan Basin and the Qilian Mountains, are being improved day by day.

This year, many teams have their own cars. The teams use these cars to frequently transport fresh vegetables and meat from Jiuquan, Yumen, and other places. The phenomenon that employees could not eat vegetables for a long time in the past has been eliminated.

Because the wind and sand on the Gobi Desert are very strong, and sometimes heavy rains fall, some tents that could not shelter from the wind and rain have been gradually replaced with brand-new mobile houses this year. According to statistics from the Yumen City Trading Company, more than 400 mobile houses have been supplied to field personnel this year.

In order to solve the problem of field personnel often drinking cold water and eating cold food, the relevant departments have also equipped some exploration teams with kerosene stoves, zinc iron pots, insulated water buckets, and insulated water bottles.

The cultural and sports life of the field teams has also improved this year. Now, most exploration teams are equipped with a radio, various chess sets, and various musical instruments. Some teams hold dances in the Gobi Desert, and no longer have to beat basins to replace musical instruments as they did in the past.

In the past, field workers could not hear theoretical or political current affairs reports for a long time. This year, the Geophysics Department used tape recorders to record some theoretical and political current affairs reports that the mine frequently holds, and rotated them to various field teams for them to study. The Geophysics Department Trade Union also organized a mobile book box, frequently carrying a large number of picture albums and books for field personnel to read. The Yumen Oil Mine is also preparing to purchase new movie projectors to show movies to field exploration personnel in rotation.

In order to further improve the material and cultural lives of the various field teams, the Geophysics Department and the Geological Survey Department of the Yumen Oil Mine recently held meetings to study and formulate some new measures to improve the lives of field workers. The Geophysics Department has already organized four working groups at the end of July to visit the families of field team employees living in Yumen and Jiuquan, and to investigate their living conditions. Now, this department is compiling a plan to provide subsidies to some employees with difficult living conditions.

### 新鲜肉菜经常有　录音报告时时来  玉门油矿多方关心野外工作人员

    新鲜肉菜经常有　录音报告时时来
    玉门油矿多方关心野外工作人员
    新华社玉门4日电　新华社记者姚秉鉴报道：正在酒泉盆地、祁连山一带进行石油地质勘探的玉门油矿的几十个野外勘探队，它们的物质文化生活在日益获得改善。
    今年，许多队都有了自己的汽车。各队利用这些汽车经常去酒泉、玉门等地拉运新鲜蔬菜和肉类。职工们过去长期吃不到蔬菜的现象已经消除了。
    由于戈壁滩上的风沙很大，有时还落起暴雨，一些不能遮挡风雨的帐篷，今年都已经陆续换成了崭新的活动房子。据玉门市贸易公司统计，今年供应野外人员的活动房子就达四百多所。
    为了解决野外人员常常喝冷水、吃冷饭的问题，有关部门还给一些勘探队配备了煤油炉子、锌铁锅、保温水桶和保温水壶等。
    各野外队的文化体育生活今年也有了改善。现在，绝大部分勘探队都配备了一架收音机和各种棋类、各种乐器。有些队在戈壁滩上举行舞会，已经不再像过去那样要敲着脸盆代替乐器了。
    过去野外工作人员长期听不到理论、政治时事报告。今年地球物理处用录音机把矿上经常举办的一些理论、政治时事报告录下来，到各个野外队轮流去放，供他们学习。地球物理处工会还组织了流动图书箱，经常携带大批画报、图书去供野外人员阅览。玉门油矿还准备购买新的电影机来给野外勘探人员轮流放映电影。
    为了更进一步改善各个野外队的物质文化生活，玉门油矿地球物理处和地质调查处最近都召开会议，研究和制定了一些新的改善野外职工生活的措施。地球物理处已经在七月底组织了四个工作组，慰问了居住在玉门、酒泉两地的野外队职工的家属，并且调查了他们的生活状况。现在，这个处正在编造计划，预备给一些生活困难的职工进行补助。
