Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th - As a gift from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army celebrating the 11th anniversary of Korea's liberation, 500 medium-sized double-wheel, double-share ploughs have been transported from Beijing to Pyongyang. Before August 15th, these agricultural tools will be presented to the Korean people.

	While launching the movement to support the agricultural collectivization in the motherland on March 22nd this year, the Volunteer Army leadership also issued a call to help the Korean people with construction. The Volunteer Army officers and soldiers responded enthusiastically to this call, actively helping the Korean people with water conservancy projects, spring ploughing and sowing, tree planting and afforestation, and disaster relief. They also launched a fervent donation drive. When discussing how to help Korea with construction, the Chinese Communist Party branch of the Third Company of a certain unit proposed donating funds to purchase double-wheel, double-share ploughs from the motherland to give to the Korean people. This initiative was immediately supported by all the officers and soldiers of the company, who donated more than 120 yuan in one day. Afterward, this movement spread throughout the entire Volunteer Army.

	The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory accepted the task of manufacturing the double-wheel, double-share ploughs. The workers of this factory regarded it as an honor to be able to present the agricultural tools they made with their own hands to the Korean people. In order to ensure that these 500 double-wheel, double-share ploughs could be delivered to Korea before "August 15th," the workers worked until late at night, braving the summer heat.

    志愿军向朝鲜解放十一周年的献礼
    五百部双轮双铧犁运到平壤
    新华社平壤11日电　中国人民志愿军捐献给朝鲜人民的五百部中型双轮双铧犁，已经从北京运到了平壤。八月十五日前夕，这批农具将作为中国人民志愿军庆祝朝鲜解放十一周年的礼品，赠送给朝鲜人民。
    志愿军领导机关在今年三月二十二日发起支援祖国农业合作化运动的同时，还发出了帮助朝鲜人民建设的号召。志愿军官兵热烈响应这一号召，他们积极帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利、春耕播种、植树造林、抢险救灾，还掀起了一个热烈的捐献热潮。某部三中队中共党支部在讨论帮助朝鲜建设的时候，提出了捐款从祖国购买双轮双铧犁赠给朝鲜人民的倡议。这一倡议立刻得到了全中队官兵的响应，一天的工夫就捐献了一百二十多元。以后，这个运动就在全志愿军中展开了。
    接受制造双轮双铧犁任务的是北京农业机械厂。这个工厂的工人们以能把自己亲手制造的农具赠给朝鲜人民引为光荣。为了能使这五百部双轮双铧犁在“八·一五”以前送到朝鲜，工人们曾冒着夏季的炎热，一直工作到深夜。
