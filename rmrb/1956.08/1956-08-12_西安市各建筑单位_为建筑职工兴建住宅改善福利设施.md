Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 10th. Recently, a new group of owners moved into the newly built Construction Workers' New Village outside Heping Gate in Xi'an. In the past two months, more than 1,000 construction workers and their families have moved into the workers' new village. This construction workers' new village was built by the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction for construction workers. The construction area of the workers' new village totals more than 36,000 square meters, of which 20,000 square meters have already been completed, and the rest will be completed soon.

This year, the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, the Xi'an Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and its affiliated engineering companies will build more than 150,000 square meters of dormitories for construction workers. The construction area of these dormitories is more than double the total construction area in the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan. By the end of this year, after all these dormitories are completed, each worker's family will have an average of 20 to 30 square meters of dormitory space, and the housing problems of more than 5,000 construction workers' families will be solved.

The newly built dormitories have relatively complete water, electricity, and sanitary facilities, and there are also welfare facilities such as trading companies, postal and telecommunications agencies, and health stations nearby. The Construction Workers' New Village outside Heping Gate has also established a primary school that can accommodate 500 children and a well-equipped kindergarten. The Dengjiapo Village Construction Workers' Residential Area, which is under intense construction, will be laid with lawns and will build entertainment squares, public canteens, health stations, etc. In addition, the engineering companies affiliated to the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction have also established more than 70 amateur sanatoriums, nutrition canteens, bathhouses, etc., near the construction sites.

    西安市各建筑单位
    为建筑职工兴建住宅改善福利设施
    新华社西安10日电　在西安市和平门外新建的建筑工人新村，最近迎接了一批新的主人。近两个月来，共有一千多户建筑职工和家属陆续迁进了工人新村。这个建筑工人新村是建筑工程部西北工程管理总局为建筑职工建设的。工人新村建筑面积共达三万六千多平方公尺，目前已经建成的有两万平方公尺，其余的不久即可全部完成。
    建筑工程部西北工程管理总局和西安市建筑工程局及所属各工程公司今年将为建筑职工兴建十五万多平方公尺的宿舍。这些宿舍的建筑面积比第一个五年计划头三年的建筑总和还多一倍。到今年年底，这些宿舍全部建成以后，每户职工平均可以得到二十到三十平方公尺面积的宿舍，五千多户建筑职工的住宅问题将获得解决。
    新建的宿舍有比较完善的水电卫生设备，附近还设有贸易公司、邮电代办所、保健站等福利设施。和平门外的建筑工人新村还建立了一所能容纳五百名儿童的小学校和一所设备比较齐全的幼儿园。正在紧张施工的邓家坡村建筑工人住宅区，将铺设草坪，兴建娱乐广场、公共食堂、保健站等。另外，建筑工程部西北工程管理总局所属各工程公司还分别在工地附近建立了业余疗养所、营养食堂、澡塘等七十多处。
