Xinhua News Agency, August 16th, Ulaanbaatar Dispatch: According to a report in the Mongolian "News," the number of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in Mongolia increased almost twofold in the first half of this year compared to last year. Last year, fewer than 20,000 people joined cooperatives, while more than 37,000 people joined in the first half of this year alone. There are now more than 500 cooperatives, with participating herding households accounting for 15% of the total number of households in the country, and collectively owned livestock in cooperatives accounting for 12% of the national total.

Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority. Last year, the number of livestock in cooperatives doubled compared to the previous year. This year, cooperative members actively responded to the call of the Party and the government and overfulfilled the cooperative's sowing plan by more than 100%. Cooperatives are also constantly strengthening organizationally and economically.

The welfare of agricultural and pastoral cooperative members is also continuously improving. In 1954, the average income of each cooperative was approximately 51,000 tugriks (Mongolian currency), while in 1955 it was nearly 57,000 tugriks. 40% of the cooperative's income was distributed to members. Currently, many cooperatives have well-equipped member residences, clubs, and schools, as well as medical service stations and radio stations.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: According to Ulaanbaatar newspapers, the total output of Mongolian handicraft cooperatives has now increased fifty-fourfold compared to the initial years of their establishment in 1931. The number of handicraft cooperatives has increased more than eightfold during this period.

Mongolian handicraft cooperatives have now become one of the largest cooperative organizations in the country. Many cooperatives in major cities and other locations throughout the country produce a wide variety of consumer goods. The variety of products is constantly increasing, and approximately 80% of the products of cooperatives are now made from local materials. In addition, some cooperatives specialize in the production of art and decorative items. The artworks they produce have been exhibited in Moscow, Beijing, and many other cities in people's democracies.

The lives and welfare of members are gradually improving. Last year, the average monthly salary of each member increased by nearly 15% compared to 1952, and the reserve fund of cooperative income increased by more than 45%. Medical service stations have been widely established in the handicraft cooperative system, and kindergartens, nurseries, sanatoriums, and medical clinics have also been set up.
