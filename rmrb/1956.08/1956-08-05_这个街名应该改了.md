    This Street Name Should Be Changed
    Since the State Council explicitly stipulated that some place names that disrespected ethnic minorities should be changed, Dihua City has already been renamed Urumqi City. However, Dihua Street at Jilin Station remains the same, and I think the name of this street should also be changed.   Li Yuankai

    这个街名应该改了
    自从国务院明令规定把历代一些不尊重少数民族的地名改掉以后，迪化市已经改名为乌鲁木齐市。但是，吉林车站的迪化街，依然照旧，我觉得，这条街的名字同样应该改一改了。    李元凯
