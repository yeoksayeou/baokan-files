Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from New York: Some observers in the United States have had to admit that the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal is entirely legal.

The "New York Herald Tribune" reporter, Higgins, said that from the perspective of international law, Egypt's actions are fully justified. The position it has adopted has the precedent of the International Court of Justice to rely on, which once supported Iran's right to nationalize the British oilfields in Abadan.

Higgins pointed out that it is unlikely that Western countries can take retaliatory action without suffering losses at the same time. He said that unofficial sources in Washington "believe that the West is likely to be defeated on the Suez Canal nationalization issue."

After studying the various courses of action that the United States, Britain, and France might take on this issue, observers Alsop Brothers came to the conclusion that all these actions would only make Western countries increasingly morally and politically untenable.

The "World Telegram and Sun" published an editorial today saying: "One thing is certain: our recent policy of trying to subdue Nasser has failed. This policy has brought us to the point where one wrong step could bring the Western world to the brink of war."

This newspaper does not advocate military action by the West because "military action or even a show of force" will "make things worse faster," and advocates submitting the matter to an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council for handling.

At the same time, some American newspapers continue to clamor for military action. For example, the "Daily Mirror" commented on the decision to nationalize the Suez Canal Company in extremely insulting terms to Egypt, and even demanded that Britain and France occupy the Suez Canal area.

    埃及收回苏彝士运河合法合理
    有些美报指出西方国家采取反对行动只会倒霉
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：美国一些观察家不得不承认，埃及政府把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定是完全合法的。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者希金斯说，从国际法的观点来看，埃及的行动是完全有根据的。它所采取的立场有国际法院的先例可援，国际法院曾经支持过伊朗把阿巴丹的英国采油场收归国有的权利。
    希金斯指出，西方国家很少有可能采取报复行动而同时不至于遭到损失。他说，华盛顿的非官方人士“认为西方很可能在苏彝士运河国有化问题上打败仗”。
    观察家艾尔索普兄弟在研究了美、英、法三国可能就这个问题采取的各种行动方针之后，得出这样的结论：这一切行动只会使得西方国家在道义上和政治上愈加站不住脚。
    “世界电讯与太阳报”在今天发表社论说：“有一件事情是肯定的：最近我们想使纳赛尔屈服的政策已经失败了。这种政策使我们落到这样的地步，就是只要走错一步就会把西方世界弄到战争的边缘。”
    这家报纸不主张西方采取军事行动，因为“军事行动或者即使显示一下武力”将会“使事情更快地恶化”，而主张把事情提交联合国安全理事会紧急会议去处理。
    同时，美国一些报纸继续叫嚣采取武力行动。例如，“每日镜报”用极尽侮辱埃及的语调来评论苏彝士运河公司国有化的决定，甚至要求英国和法国占领苏彝士运河地区。
