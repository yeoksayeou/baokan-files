Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 2nd - Representatives from Burma, China, India, North Korea, Nepal and Vietnam, who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian Writers Conference, held a press conference at the Standard Restaurant in New Delhi on the evening of July 31st.

At the press conference, an appeal to Asian writers and a communique from the preparatory meeting were released.

An appeal to Asian writers issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Asian Writers Conference called for strengthening ties between Asian intellectuals.

The appeal stated: Asian intellectuals are increasingly aware that at this turning point in history, all those who are concerned about the profound issues of civilization and culture, that is, the writers of our countries, should come together.

The appeal stated: For hundreds of years, Asia has been subjected to foreign rule, many traditional cultures of Asian countries have been destroyed, and the entire culture of Asia has been corrupted.

The appeal pointed out that the ties between fraternal intellectuals in Asian countries, after being interrupted by foreign interference, are now just beginning to recover. Asian writers unanimously believe that they should gather together to assess their respective literary and cultural traditions, to establish an atmosphere of understanding and friendship, in which countries striving for peace and freedom will be able to jointly carry out new creative work.

The appeal stated: This effort to bring everyone together to discuss issues of common concern to Asian writers will arouse the pleasure and active cooperation of intellectuals in the awakening Asia.

The appeal concluded: We hope that writers from Asian countries will form the necessary core to prepare for the Asian Writers Conference to be held in New Delhi this December, and bring to our conference a sense of dedication, which alone can enable us to achieve lasting results for the common good and the expansion of our respective cultures.

Representatives of each country announced on behalf of their national writers their full support for the decision to hold the Asian Writers Conference and expressed the hope that the conference would further consolidate Asian solidarity and peace.

    号召亚洲知识分子加强联系共同工作
    据新华社新德里2日电　出席亚洲作家会议筹备会议的缅甸、中国、印度、朝鲜、尼泊尔和越南的代表们七月三十一日晚间在新德里标准餐厅举行记者招待会。
    在记者招待会上发表了对亚洲各国作家的呼吁书和筹备会议的公报。
    亚洲作家会议筹备委员会会议发表的一封告亚洲作家的呼吁书，号召加强亚洲知识分子之间的联系。
    呼吁书说：亚洲知识分子愈来愈感觉到，在历史的这个转折点，凡是关心文明和文化的深远问题的人，也就是说我们这些国家的作家们，应该会聚在一堂。
    呼吁书说：几百年来，亚洲一直受到外国的统治，亚洲各国的许多传统文化遭到破坏，亚洲的整个文化被败坏了。
    呼吁书指出，亚洲各国的兄弟知识分子之间的联系在经过外来干涉而中断之后现在刚刚开始恢复。亚洲作家一致认为，应该彼此聚首一堂来估价各自的文学和文化的传统，来建立谅解和友好的气氛，在这种气氛中争取和平和自由的各国将能够共同进行新的创造性的工作。
    呼吁书说：使大家聚集一堂来讨论亚洲作家共同有关的问题的这种努力，将引起觉醒中的亚洲的各国知识分子的愉快和积极的合作。
    呼吁书最后说：我们希望亚洲国家的作家将组成必要的核心来筹备定在今年十二月在新德里举行的亚洲作家会议，并为我们的会议带来一种献身的感觉，单单是这样一种感觉就能够使我们为了共同利益和扩大我们各自的文化而取得永久性的结果。
    各国代表们代表他们本国的作家宣布完全支持举行亚洲作家会议的决定，并且表示希望会议将进一步巩固亚洲团结和和平。
