The First Morning
　　Hua Zongwen

August 25th marked the day the First Tractor Factory began installing equipment.

That morning, the installation workers put on their spotless white gloves and clean blue work uniforms, and excitedly rushed towards the auxiliary workshops of the tractor factory. In a corner of the auxiliary workshops—on the flat concrete floor of the machine repair shop and electrical repair shop—dozens of machines, still in their crates, were arranged. Among the rows of machines, a truck crane, resembling half a car, emitted a low roar. Early-arriving installation workers squatted on the ground, forming circle after circle. They spread out blueprints and concentrated intently on the final research work before installation. Technical personnel, holding crimson pens and precise steel measuring tapes, marked the symbols of the machines in the black-lined squares on the ground. Outside the site, civil engineering and hydro-electric installation workers were also attracted by the novel and enthusiastic scene. They held their tools and stood there, watching the machines with rapt attention. "Made in our China!" "Isn't that right!" The wooden crates containing the machines were marked with the names of the manufacturing units: the Beijing Machine Tool Plant, the Shenyang Machine Tool Plant, as well as many factories in Dalian, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places.

The moment arrived. A truck crane driver, wearing an old military uniform, agilely jumped into the driver's seat. It was him, Hao Yingjun, the anti-American, aid-Korea warrior and heroic truck driver who had earned three citations for merit. He had once driven four hundred and fifty kilometers overnight in the icy snow and rugged Korean mountain roads, using his wisdom and courage to defeat the American air pirates who called themselves "Air Kings." Today, look how spirited he is: his skilled and agile hands turning the steering wheel, the crane slowly driving towards the machine, extending its strong iron arm, deftly picking up the machine, and then gently placing it in its designated position.

Crack! The workers of the Zhang Tiezha group used crowbars to open the wooden crate, and in the blink of an eye, they had peeled open a grinder. No wonder they were so swift. It turned out that this group was a well-known advanced youth shock team on the construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and had been the winner in the socialist competition for six consecutive months. Crack! Crack! Crate after crate was opened, and the exhilarating sounds resounded throughout the entire factory building. "One, two! One, two!" This was the Wang Zhangfu group chanting slogans in unison. The entire piece of crate skin was peeled off whole, and the huge automated lathe was immediately revealed before everyone's eyes. Just a few months ago, they were heroic peacekeepers and excellent tank soldiers. Now, when the socialist construction of the motherland needed them, they laid down their weapons, picked up their tools, and became outstanding builders.

The technicians arrived. With excited hearts, they scraped off a thick layer of grease from the machines. They brought their faces close to the machines, almost wanting to kiss these lovely fellows. They conducted external inspections of the machines as meticulously as surgeons. Some people muttered from time to time, "Good, good."

Around ten o'clock in the morning, more than ten machines had been uncrated, inspected, and placed in their appropriate positions. At this time, the sun flashed rays of light from the gaps in the clouds, shining through the clear glass on the roof, onto the rows of silver-gray machines, and onto the faces of the workers with smiles and beads of sweat.

    第一天早晨
    华宗文
    8月25日，是第一拖拉机制造厂开始安装设备的日子。
    这天清早，安装工人们就戴起洁白的手套，穿起干净的蓝色工作服，兴奋地向拖拉机厂辅助工场赶来。在辅助工场的一角——机修车间和电修车间平坦的混凝土地面上，排列着几十台没有开箱的机器。机器的行列当中，一部好似半截汽车的插式起重机发出低沉的吼声。早到的安装工人，蹲在地上，围成一个又一个的圆圈。他们摊开图纸，聚精会神地进行安装前最后的一次研究工作。技术人员们拿着朱红色的笔和精密的钢皮尺，在地下划好黑线的方格子里，标示出机器的符号。现场外边，土木建筑工人和水电安装工人们，也为今天这新颖、热烈的场面所吸引。他们拿着工具，站在那里目不转睛地看着机器。“咱们中国制造的！”“可不是吗！”装机器的木箱上写着呢，制造这些机器的单位，有北京的机床厂、沈阳的机床厂，还有大连、上海、重庆等地的许多工厂。
    到时候了。一位穿着旧军装的插式起重机司机，敏捷地跳上司机台。就是他，立过三次功的抗美援朝战士、英雄的汽车司机郝英俊，曾经在冰天雪地里、在崎岖的朝鲜山道上，一夜跑过四百五十公里，用自己的智慧和勇敢战胜了号称“空中霸王”的美国空中强盗。今天，你瞧他多么神气：熟练、灵活的手转动着方向盘，起重机徐徐地向机器驶去，伸出强劲的铁臂，轻巧地把机器端起来，然后，轻轻地把它放到预定的位置上。
    咔嚓，张铁栅小组的工人用撬棍打开了木箱，转眼的功夫就把一台砂轮机剥了出来。怪不得他们这样敏捷，原来这个小组是第一汽车制造厂工地上有名的先进青年突击组，是社会主义竞赛中连续六个月的获胜者。咔嚓，咔嚓，箱子一个跟一个地打开了，振奋人心地声音一下子响辙了整个厂房。“一二，一二”，这是王章福小组在整齐地喊号子，整块的箱皮被囫囵着揭了下来，巨大的自动化车床立刻展现在人们面前。几个月以前，他们还是英勇的和平保卫者，优秀的坦克兵。现在，当祖国社会主义建设需要他们的时候，他们又丢下武器，拿起工具，成了出色的建设者。
    技术员走来了。他们怀着激动的心情，刮掉机器上一层厚厚的黄油。他们把脸凑近机器，差一点没有吻一吻这可爱的家伙。他们像外科医生似地细致地对机器进行了外部检查。有的人嘴里不时地咕哝着：“好，好。”
    上午十点多钟光景，十多部机器已经开完箱，检查过，安放在适当的位置上了。这时，太阳从云缝里闪出一道道光芒，透过屋顶上明净的玻璃，照射在一排排银灰色的机器上，照射在工人们带着微笑和汗珠的脸上。
