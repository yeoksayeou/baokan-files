Don't Let the Jiang Huazhongs Run Rampant
Yi Zhi
The Shandong Dazhong Daily published an article on August 4th titled "County Chief Jiang Loses His Temper," exposing how Jiang Huazhong, the county chief of Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, in order to detain a private opera troupe from a neighboring county, abused his power by dismissing the troupe's director and deputy director, expelling them from the troupe; stopping the supply of food to the troupe members; forbidding the troupe members from leaving by car; and illegally interrogating cadres from the neighboring county who came to negotiate on behalf of the troupe. The county chief wanted to show his authority and subdue the "small opera troupe." However, the troupe was not "subdued," and the county chief received the punishment he deserved.

I think that in our country, there are not many county chiefs like this, but Jiang Huazhong-like figures are not rare. He himself felt that as long as he held power, he could act arbitrarily and domineeringly, disregarding even national laws and Party discipline. But, in the end, it is always he himself who suffers.

However, this illegal bad deed was not done by one person alone. It was precisely because some people blindly followed him that he was able to mobilize his forces and smoothly attack the "small opera troupe." Jiang Huazhong wanted his subordinates to announce the "order" to dismiss the troupe leader, wanted the grain bureau to stop supplying food to the troupe, wanted the bus station to prevent the actors from getting on the bus, and wanted the court to interrogate the cadres sent by the neighboring county. If these cadres and relevant departments, after receiving the "order," had seriously used their brains to think, discovered the errors, and adhered to principles to resist, creating a "checkpoint" for the illegal event, Jiang Huazhong's reckless actions might have been stopped earlier.

Some people may say: The problem is not easy to see, and the people who do bad things always have plausible reasons, as if everything they do is right. But their "reasons" are often without foundation and not worth scrutinizing.

The problem is not to blindly obey, nor to obey casually. People who violate laws and discipline often overstep their authority, interfering in matters they shouldn't, sweeping away human sentiments and national laws, leaving only their arrogant "authority." We must resolutely resist such people and not listen to their nonsense. As long as everyone resists illegal behavior and builds a copper wall and iron barrier, no matter how "heroic" the Jiang Huazhong-like figures are, they will not be able to break through, and their authority will be unable to be exerted.

    不许姜华忠们横行
    宜之
    八月四日山东大众日报登了一篇“姜县长大动肝火”的文章，揭发了山东省诸城县长姜华忠为了达到扣留邻县私营剧团的目的，竟滥用职权撤消剧团正副团长的职务，并开除团籍；停止供给剧团人员粮食；不准剧团人员坐汽车离开；非法审问邻县为剧团的事来交涉的干部。县长要大摆威风非治服“小小的剧团”不可。但剧团没有被“治服”，而县长却受了应得的处分。
    我想，在我们国家里，这样的县长是不多的，但姜华忠式的人物却也并非凤毛麟角。他自己觉得只要大权在手，就可以任意横行霸道，连国法党纪都不顾了。可是，结果，倒霉的永远是他自己。
    但是，这件违法的坏事不是一个人做成的。正是因为有些人闭着眼睛顺着他，所以他才能调兵遣将，顺利地打击“小小的剧团”。姜华忠要让他的下级干部去宣布撤消团长职务的“命令”，要让粮食局停发剧团的粮食，要让汽车站不准演员上汽车，要叫法庭审讯邻县派去的干部。如果这些干部和有关部门接到“命令”之后，认真用脑子想一想，发现错误，坚持原则加以抵制，给违法事件造成“关口”，姜华忠的胡作非为就可能早被挡住了。
    有人会说：问题不容易看出来呀，做坏事的人总是振振有词，仿佛全是他对。但是他们的“理由”往往没有根基，值不得推敲。
    问题是不要盲目服从，也不要随便服从。违法乱纪的人常常越权，管不着的事他也管，人情、国法被他一扫而光，剩下的只是他那不可一世的“威风”。对这样的人，就要坚决地抵制，不听他那一套。只要人人都来抵制违法行为，筑成一道铜墙铁壁，这样无论姜华忠式的人物多“英勇”，也冲不过去，他那威风也无法施展。
