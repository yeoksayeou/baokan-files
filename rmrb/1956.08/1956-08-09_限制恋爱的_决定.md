    The "Decision" to Restrict Romance
    Zhang Shude, the director of the Zigong City Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Sichuan Province, has publicly and formally announced more than once at Party meetings, forums, and cadre conferences: New employees are forbidden from dating during their probationary period, for at least a year! Those who already have partners are only allowed to maintain the relationship, not to go on dates! He also said that this was a decision of the Party, and no one could violate it.
    At the Party branch meeting, everyone questioned Zhang Shude and asked him to produce the official document. He said it was a notice from the Municipal Party Committee. We continued to press him, and he said it was said by a secretary of the Provincial Post and Telecommunications Administration Party Group.
    Due to Director Zhang's restrictions, the romances of many young people have been affected. Yi Weizhi

    限制恋爱的“决定”
    四川省自贡市邮电局局长张术德，不止一次在党的会议上、座谈会上、干部大会上，公开地、正式地宣布：新参加工作的人，在实习期间禁止谈恋爱，时间起码在一年之内！已经有爱人的，只准保留，不准外会！他还说，这是党的决定，任何人不能违背。
    在党的支部大会上，大家曾质问过张术德，并叫他拿出正式文件来，他说这是市委的通知。我们继续追问，他又说这是省邮电管理局分党组一个书记说的。
    由于张局长的限制，不少青年的恋爱受到影响。　易维智
