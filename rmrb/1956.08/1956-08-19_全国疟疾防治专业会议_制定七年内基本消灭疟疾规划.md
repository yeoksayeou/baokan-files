Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 16th: A plan to basically eliminate malaria in China within the next seven years was formulated at the National Malaria Prevention and Control Conference, which concluded on the 14th.

The conference began on the 7th in Guangzhou. After full discussion, the representatives attending the meeting believed that it is possible to basically eliminate malaria in China within the next seven years. They unanimously pointed out that malaria is a serious infectious disease that endangers the lives and health of the working people in China. After the national liberation, the health departments dispatched a large number of epidemic prevention personnel to the malaria-prone areas to carry out prevention and control work, and have achieved certain results in reducing the incidence of malaria and training anti-malaria cadres. At present, twenty-three malaria prevention and control stations and one malaria research station have been established in provinces with a high prevalence of malaria. Preliminary understanding has been gained through investigation and research on issues such as the species of the main vector of malaria transmission—the Anopheles mosquito—as well as the nature and distribution of malaria areas.

The plan formulated at the meeting proposes that in the next two years, a large number of senior, intermediate, and junior anti-malaria technical personnel should be trained first. Furthermore, specialized malaria prevention and control institutions should be generally established in various provinces and malaria-prone counties in order to carry out mass malaria prevention and control work in depth. Local health departments will strengthen ties with management departments of factories, mines, railways, highways, construction, and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects, taking these basic construction project areas as key areas for malaria prevention and control, to ensure that industrial and agricultural production is not harmed by malaria epidemics.

The plan also determined that comprehensive measures must be taken to eliminate malaria in the future. First, the source of infection must be eliminated by treating malaria patients, and various methods must be used to eliminate Anopheles mosquitoes and strengthen work such as preventing mosquito bites and protecting health. In terms of malaria treatment methods, it is necessary to emphasize learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in light of local conditions, using a variety of effective methods, and paying special attention to researching and developing the experience and methods of traditional Chinese medicine in preventing and treating malaria, to carry out comprehensive malaria treatment.

During the meeting to formulate the above plan, representatives from twenty provinces and cities including Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Shanghai, and the Ili Malaria Prevention and Control Station in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, also exchanged experiences in malaria prevention and control work in various regions. Dr. Liu Yinlong, who had conducted a long-term survey and anti-malaria experiment on malaria in Hainan Island, made a report at the meeting entitled "Introduction to the Anti-Malaria Experience in a Stubborn Malaria Area in Hainan Island." Representatives from Yunnan Province and the Ili Malaria Prevention and Control Station in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region respectively introduced their experiences in training rural malaria prevention and control technicians and carrying out anti-malaria work in ethnic minority areas. Liang Naijin, president of the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, specifically introduced the effective experiences of traditional Chinese medicine in preventing malaria and using acupuncture and moxibustion and drug treatment in his report. The diverse anti-malaria experiences gathered by representatives from various regions will be compiled by relevant departments into a "Malaria Prevention and Control Manual" for national application.

    全国疟疾防治专业会议
    制定七年内基本消灭疟疾规划
    新华社广州16日电　中国在今后七年内基本消灭疟疾的规划，已在十四日结束的全国疟疾防治专业会议上制定出来。
    这个会议是七日开始在广州举行的。参加会议的代表经过充分讨论后，认为今后七年内在中国基本上消灭疟疾是可能的。他们一致指出，疟疾在中国是一种严重危害劳动人民生命健康的传染病。全国解放后，卫生部门派遣了大批防疫人员深入疟疾流行地区，开展防治工作，在降低疟疾的发病率和培养抗疟干部方面已收到一定的效果。目前，在全国疟疾流行较多的省份已经建立了二十三个疟疾防治站和一个疟疾研究站，对疟疾传染的主要媒介——疟蚊的种别、疟区性质及分布概况等问题，经调查研究后已经有了初步的了解。
    会议制定的规划提出，在今、明两年内首先要大量培养各方面的高级、中级、初级抗疟技术人员，并且要在各省及疟疾流行的县份普遍设立疟疾防治专业机构，以便深入开展群众性的疟疾防治工作。各地卫生部门将与工厂、矿山、铁道、公路、建筑及农林水利等管理部门加强联系，以这些基本建设工程地区作为防治疟疾的重点区，保障工农业生产不受疟疾流行的侵害。
    规划还确定，今后消灭疟疾必须采取全面的综合性的措施。首先要从治疗疟疾病人方面消灭传染病源，并且用各种办法消灭疟蚊和加强防止蚊害、保护健康等工作。在疟疾的治疗方法上，要强调因地制宜地学习苏联先进经验，运用多种多样的有效方法，特别要注意研究和发挥中医防治疟疾的经验和方法，全面进行疟疾治疗。
    在制定上述规划的会议中，来自四川、云南、贵州、广西、广东、上海等二十个省市和新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁疟疾防治站的代表们，还交流了各地在疟疾防治工作方面的经验。曾在海南岛对疟疾进行较长时期调查研究和抗疟试验工作的刘吟龙医师，在会上作了“海南岛一个顽固性疟疾区的抗疟经验介绍”的报告。云南省和新疆维吾尔自治区伊犁疟疾防治站的代表，分别介绍了他们在少数民族地区培养农村的疟疾防治技术人员和开展抗疟工作的经验。广东省中医实验医院院长梁乃津，在他的报告中专门对中医预防疟疾及采用针灸、药物治疗等行之有效的经验作了介绍。会议汇集的各地代表的多种多样的抗疟经验，将由有关部门编成“疟疾防治手册”，供全国运用。
