Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. Recently, the Nantong City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Jiangsu Province has sorted out and identified a special traditional Chinese medicine formula for treating snake venom. This is a secret ancestral formula publicly disclosed not long ago by Ji Desheng, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in the suburbs of Nantong City.

This medicine can be used to treat poisoning symptoms caused by bites from various venomous snakes and other venomous insects. Simply apply the medicine mixed with saliva in a circle around the wound where the poisonous snake bit, and after a few minutes, the venomous fluid will flow out of the wound, immediately relieving pain and reducing swelling. If snake fangs are broken off in the muscle, they can be removed with a needle, and then the medicine can be applied in the same way, which will also be effective. In addition to its effective external use, if the patient is deeply poisoned by a snake bite, causing coma due to invasion of the central nervous system, it can also be taken internally, with good results.

This medicine is made by juicing seven herbs, including *Lobelia chinensis* (or *Scutellaria barbata*), *Humulus scandens*, *Sedum sarmentosum*, *Paris polyphylla*, *Ophiopogon japonicus*, *Campsis grandiflora*, and *Kummerowia striata*, and then mixing them with ash made from scorched diseased wheat (i.e., wheat with black smut), toad, snake, centipede, gecko, large wasp nest or hornet's nest. After a certain production process, it is made into black medicinal cakes about the size of ordinary abacus beads.

The Nantong City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is further studying and sorting out the preparation method and treatment methods of this medicine. The relevant units in Nantong City also plan to cultivate these herbs artificially in the suburbs.

### 治疗毒蛇咬伤有了特效中药方

    治疗毒蛇咬伤有了特效中药方
    新华社南京29日电　最近江苏省南通市中医院整理鉴定了一种专门治疗蛇毒的特效中药方。这是南通市郊区中医季德胜不久以前公开出来的祖传秘方。
    用这种药可以治疗各种毒蛇咬伤和其他毒虫咬伤的中毒病症。只要将这种药沾唾液在被毒蛇咬了的伤口四周涂一个圆圈，几分钟以后毒水就从伤口流出，立即止痛消肿。假如有蛇牙断在肌肉里，可即用针拨掉，然后用同样方法涂上药，也可以见效。这种药除去外用有效以外，如患者被蛇咬中毒较深，因侵犯到中枢神经发生昏迷时，也可以内服，疗效也好。
    这种药是用半边莲（或半枝莲）、葎草、佛甲草、蚤休、麦门冬、翘摇、鸡眼草等七种药草榨汁，再渗和了用霉麦（即有黑穗病麦）、蟾蜍、蛇、蜈蚣、守宫、大荣蜂窝或革巢蜂窝等炙的灰，经过一定的制作过程，制成像普通算盘珠一样大的黑色药饼。
    南通市中医院正在进一步研究整理这种药的制法和治疗方法。南通市的有关单位还计划用人工在郊区栽培这些药草。
