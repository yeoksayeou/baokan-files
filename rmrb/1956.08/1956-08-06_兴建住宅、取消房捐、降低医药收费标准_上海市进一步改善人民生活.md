Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 5th: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has adopted further measures to improve the livelihood of the people of Shanghai. It has been determined that an additional 280,000 square meters of worker housing will be built this year, and that housing tax will be abolished citywide, and hospital and clinic fee standards will be comprehensively reduced. These measures were proposed in the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee's financial work report. This report has been distributed to the People's Representatives at the preparatory meeting of the Fourth Session of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress held on August 3rd.

According to the person in charge of the Municipal People's Committee: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has been taking various measures to improve the people's livelihood in recent years, but due to objective limitations and shortcomings in our work, there are still many difficulties in people's lives. In the future, the government will, with the continuous development of production, try its best to utilize all possible conditions to gradually and further improve the people's living welfare. For example, regarding the housing problem, the housing built by the government and enterprises in recent years has solved the housing problem for 300,000 people. However, due to the rapid population growth, the construction of new housing cannot keep up with the demand. This year, it has been decided to build another 280,000 square meters of housing, striving to complete most of it within the year, and it is expected to provide housing for more than 37,000 people.

The housing tax was originally an old tax system left over from before liberation. The People's Government had considered abolishing this tax system and replacing it with a property tax after liberation to reasonably reduce the burden on the people. However, due to the complex housing rental relationships in Shanghai, changing the tax system would inevitably cause confusion in rental relationships, so reform was not carried out. Now that most of the private real estate enterprises have implemented joint state-private ownership, the conditions for reform are fully mature. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has instructed relevant departments to study plans and implement them starting from the fourth quarter.

In terms of health care, this year, all 62 private hospitals (with 3,052 beds) and 20 medical laboratories in the city have been taken over and converted into public hospitals, charging fees according to public hospital standards, which has reduced some of the burden on the people. At present, the fee standards of public hospitals are still high. The Municipal People's Committee has instructed the health department to comprehensively reduce drug costs first starting in August, and other fee standards are also planned to be gradually reduced. In addition, this year, it is also planned to build a new hospital with 150 beds, and to implement public assistance for the city's joint clinics, strengthen leadership, and adjust medical institutions to improve the problem of crowded outpatient clinics and reduce the burden on the working people.

Regarding schools, some measures have also been taken. At the beginning of this year, the government had taken over all 805 private middle schools, primary schools, kindergartens, and remedial schools in the city and converted them into public schools, charging unified fees according to the fee standards of public schools, reducing the burden on residents of the city. At the same time, measures have also been taken to fully utilize the potential of these schools, and a two-shift system has been implemented in most schools to expand enrollment. It is expected that the vast majority of school-age children in the city will be able to enroll this year.

### 兴建住宅、取消房捐、降低医药收费标准  上海市进一步改善人民生活

    兴建住宅、取消房捐、降低医药收费标准
    上海市进一步改善人民生活
    新华社上海5日电　上海市人民委员会采取进一步的措施，来改善上海市人民的生活。目前已确定在今年年内再建筑面积二十八万平方公尺的工人住宅，并将取消全市房捐和全面降低医院和门诊部的收费标准。这些措施是在上海市人民委员会的财政工作报告中提出的。这份报告已在八月三日举行的上海市人民代表大会第四次会议的预备会上分发给人民代表。
    据市人民委员会负责人说：上海市人民政府几年来一直采取各种办法来改善人民生活，但由于客观条件的限制和工作中的缺点，人民生活上还有不少困难。今后政府将随着生产的不断发展，尽量利用一切可能的条件来逐步地更多地改善人民群众的生活福利。例如房屋问题，几年来由政府和企业拨款建造的住宅已解决了三十万人的居住问题。但由于人口增长的快，新建住宅赶不上需要，今年决定再兴建二十八万平方公尺面积的住房，争取大部在年内完成，预计可供给三万七千多人居住。
    房捐原是解放前留下的旧税制，人民政府在解放后就曾考虑取消这种税制，改征房产税，合理减轻人民负担。但由于上海房屋租赁关系复杂，改变税制势必引起租赁关系混乱，因此没有进行改革。现在私营房地产企业绝大部分已实行公私合营，改革条件完全成熟，上海市人民委员会已责成有关部门研究方案，从第四季度起实行。
    在卫生保健事业方面，今年已将全市六十二座私立医院（有床位3，052张）及二十个医学化验所全部接办改为公立，按公立医院标准收费，已减轻了人民一些负担。目前公立医院的费用标准还偏高，现市人民委员会已责成卫生部门从八月份起先将药费全面调低，其他各项收费标准也准备逐步降低。此外，今年还计划新建一所医院，设病床一百五十张，并对全市联合诊所实行民办公助，加强领导，调整医疗机构，以改善门诊拥挤现象和减轻劳动人民的负担。
    关于学校方面也采取了一些措施。今年年初政府已将全市私立中学、小学、幼儿园和补习学校等805所全部接办，改为公立，按照公立学校收费标准统一收费，减轻了本市居民负担。同时还采取了充分发挥这些学校潜在力量的措施，在大部分学校内实行两部制扩大招生人数。预计今年全市学龄儿童绝大部分都能入学。
