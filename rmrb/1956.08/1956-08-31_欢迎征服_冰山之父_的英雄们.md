    Welcome the Heroes Who Conquered the "Father of Ice Mountains"
    The heroes of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team, with the greatest courage and tenacity, conquered the world-renowned Muztagh Ata peak, victoriously concluded this expedition, and arrived in Beijing. We are very pleased to welcome these heroes and extend our cordial greetings and congratulations to them.
    More than sixty years ago, the famous Swedish traveler Sven Hedin made an attempt to climb the 7,546-meter-high Muztagh Ata peak; half a century later, the famous British mountaineer Shipton also made six attempts. However, they all retreated before crossing the 7,000-meter mark. The heroes of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team, in just six days, planted the flag of victory on this peak where no human footprints had ever been imprinted, and then in five days climbed the peak of Kongur Tagh, which is 7,595 meters above sea level. The heroic feat of conquering Muztagh Ata, known as the "Father of Ice Mountains," and Kongur Tagh not only fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of Chinese and Soviet mountaineers and showed the brotherly unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, but also enhanced the ties and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in sports.
    Mountaineering enables people to obtain comprehensive physical exercise and cultivate the noble qualities of perseverance, courage, resourcefulness, tenacity, collectivism, and patriotism. When mountaineers march towards high mountains, they will climb rocks of varying degrees of difficulty, cross mountain torrents, and pass through glaciers and snowfields. At the same time, they must also fight against the ever-changing mountain climate. All this not only requires mountaineers to have comprehensive physical training and a strong will, but also the ability to adapt to the high-altitude climate. Mountaineering is different from other sports. A ball game lasts only sixty or ninety minutes, while mountaineering requires several days or even dozens of days, and you have to carry dozens of pounds of items on your back. Therefore, this sport is a great exercise for people's physical strength and endurance.
    Mountaineering is also an interesting form of sports activity. It can broaden people's horizons, increase knowledge, enrich people's lives, and have the effect of active rest. When mountaineers are climbing mountains, they can not only observe various scenes of nature, investigate various exotic flowers, trees, birds and animals, but also collect various valuable geographical, geological, meteorological, natural resource and other materials for themselves or scientists to conduct research, and further make beneficial contributions to national construction. Undoubtedly, these activities will greatly interest and delight people.
    Since ancient times, our people have had the custom of gathering to ascend to heights, similar to mountaineering. This is recorded in many ancient books, such as the Book of Rites, which says that in midsummer, "one can live in a high and bright place, one can look far away, and one can ascend to mountains and hills." Another example is the Record of Customs, which says, "Meet on the Double Ninth Festival and climb mountains." However, it has only been in recent years that it has been regarded as a sports activity. The geographical conditions for carrying out mountaineering in our country are very good. Our country is a mountainous country, with the world-famous Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, Altai Mountains and Pamir Plateau, as well as the scenic Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, and Mount Emei, which are admired by the world. Even in the suburbs of many large and medium-sized cities, there are some beautiful and steep peaks. We can make full use of these natural conditions to let mountaineering develop among the broad masses.
    Carrying out mountaineering is a meaningful and fresh thing. Sports departments should in the future promote its significance and role well, so that the masses can understand that mountaineering is good for enhancing people's physical fitness and for production and national defense construction, and actively participate in mountaineering. The promotion of mountaineering requires gradual progress. At present, we can train some mountaineering coaches and key members, select a few sports associations with better foundations and conditions and more sound organizations, focus on establishing mountaineering camp organizations, and gradually achieve from nothing to something, from small to large, and from low level to high level.
    The heroes of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team who conquered the "Father of Ice Mountains" have brought many valuable and rich mountaineering experiences for us to learn from. We must build on the achievements of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team to climb and conquer more peaks.

### 欢迎征服“冰山之父”的英雄们

    欢迎征服“冰山之父”的英雄们
    中苏混合爬山队的英雄们，以最大的勇敢和坚韧的精神，征服了世界闻名的慕士塔格山峰，胜利地结束了这次活动，来到了北京。我们非常高兴地欢迎这些英雄们，并且向他们致以亲切的慰问和祝贺。
    在六十多年前，著名的瑞典旅行家赫定曾经作过攀登拔海七千五百四十六公尺的慕士塔格山峰的试探；半个世纪以后，英国著名的登山运动家希普顿也曾作过六次试探。但是，他们都没有越过七千公尺就败退下来。中苏混合爬山队的英雄们，只用了六天的时间，就把胜利的旗帜插上这座从来没有印过人类足迹的山峰上，接着又以五天的时间攀登了拔海七千五百九十五公尺的公格尔九别山峰顶。英雄们征服号称“冰山之父”的慕士塔格山峰和公格尔九别山的壮举，不仅充分表现了中苏两国爬山运动员的英雄气概，显示了中苏两国人民兄弟般的亲密团结，而且增进了中苏两国之间在体育运动方面的联系和合作。
    爬山运动能使人们获得体能的全面锻炼，培养人们坚毅、勇敢、机智、顽强和集体主义、爱国主义的高贵品质。爬山运动员在向高山进军的时候，他们将要攀登各种困难程度不同的岩石，越过山间的急流，通过冰河和积雪地带，同时，还要同变幻无常的高山气候进行斗争。这一切不仅要求爬山运动员具有全面体能的锻炼，具有坚强的意志，而且还要有适应高山气候的本领。爬山运动与别的运动不同，一场球赛不过六十分钟，或者九十分钟，而爬山运动却需要持续几天甚至几十天，身上还要背负几十斤的物件。因此，这种运动对人们的体力和耐久力都是一种巨大的锻炼。
    爬山运动也是一种饶有趣味的体育活动形式。它可以使人们扩大眼界，增长知识，丰富人们的生活内容，并且具有积极休息的作用。爬山运动员在爬山的时候，不仅可以观察自然界的各种景象，考察各种奇异的花草树木、飞禽走兽，而且可以收集各种地理、地质、气象、自然富源以及其它许多宝贵的资料，供给自己或科学家们进行研究，进一步对国家建设作出有益的贡献。在这些活动中，无疑地会使人们发生很大的兴趣和愉快。
    我国人民很早以来，就有类似爬山运动的相聚登高的习俗。这在许多古籍中都有记载，如礼记中说，仲夏“可以居高明，可以远眺望，可以升山陵”。又如风土记中说，“重阳相会，登山”。但是，把它当做一个体育运动项目，还是近几年来的事情。我国开展爬山运动的地理条件是非常好的。我国是一个多山的国家，有世界闻名的喜马拉雅山、昆仑山、天山、阿尔泰山和帕米尔高原，还有为世界所称羡的风光绮丽的泰山、华山、衡山、峨嵋山，就是在许多大中城市的近郊，也有一些秀美、峭拔的山峰。我们可以充分地利用这些自然条件，让爬山运动在广大群众中开展起来。
    开展爬山运动是一件有意义的新鲜事情，体育部门在今后要好好地宣传它的意义和作用，使群众了解到爬山运动对增强人民体质，和对生产和国防建设都有好处，积极来参加爬山运动。推行爬山运动要求循序渐进。目前，我们可以培养一些爬山运动教练员和骨干分子，选择几个基础和条件比较好、组织比较健全的体育协会，重点建立爬山营的组织，逐步做到从无到有，从小到大，从低级到高级。
    征服“冰山之父”的中苏混合爬山队的英雄们，带来许多宝贵的、丰富的爬山经验，供给我们学习。我们要在中苏混合爬山队这一成就的基础上，去攀登和征服更多的山峰。
