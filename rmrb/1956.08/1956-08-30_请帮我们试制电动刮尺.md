    Please Help Us Trial-Produce an Electric Smoothing Ruler
    I am the captain of the youth shock team of the 108th Engineering Section of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and have attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers. During the congress, I studied the electric plastering machine created by Comrade Liu Jingshan, the electric mortar compression squeezer created by Comrade Long Wenzhong, and the electric spraying machine imitated by Comrade Cheng Yongxiang. After returning, I planned to promote them here. But the problem came: the plastering project requires two procedures. If the first procedure uses an electric plastering machine, and the second procedure still uses a hand-held smoothing ruler to flatten and smooth, it just can't keep up. The leaders asked me to use my brain and find a way to use machinery for the second procedure as well. I thought for a long time, drew a sketch of the electric smoothing ruler, and then made a model, which were all sent to the technical section of the Engineering Bureau in June. When the Rationalization Proposal Committee of the Engineering Bureau met in July, many people talked about the electric smoothing ruler. At that time, Director Chen said that the machine orders across the country were already full, and our machine could not be inserted. Later, Engineer Wu of the Technical Section of the Engineering Bureau also said that no one in our Engineering Bureau could draw the detailed drawings of this tool, and there were no raw materials, so it could not be trial-produced.
    Now, the socialist construction of our country is advancing by leaps and bounds. Our construction enterprises are in great need of machinery for the plastering work. I hope relevant departments will pay attention to this issue and help us trial-produce an electric smoothing ruler.

    请帮我们试制电动刮尺
    我是建筑工程部洛阳工程局一○八工区青年突击队队长，曾经出席过全国先进生产者代表大会。大会期间，我学习了刘景山同志创造的电动抹灰机、龙文忠同志创造的电动压缩挤浆器和程永祥同志仿造的电动喷灰器。回来以后，准备在我们这里推广。可是问题来了：抹灰工程要经过两道工序，如果第一道工序使用电动抹灰机，第二道工序还使用手柄刮尺来压平、压光，就怎么也跟不上去。领导同志便让我开动脑筋，设法使第二道工序也能用机械。我想了好久，画出了电动刮尺的草图，后来又制了一个模型，在6月间都送给工程局技术处。7月间工程局合理化建议委员会开会的时候，好多人都谈到这部电动刮尺的问题。当时，陈局长说，全国的机器订货已经排满了，我们的机器插不进去。后来，工程局技术处的吴工程师也说，我们工程局没有人来画这个工具的详细图纸，也没有原材料，无法试制。
    现在，我国的社会主义建设正在突飞猛进。我们建筑企业抹灰工种很需要机械。希望有关部门重视这个问题，帮助我们试制电动刮尺。
