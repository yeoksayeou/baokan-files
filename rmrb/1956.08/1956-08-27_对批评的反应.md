    Quality of Anshan Iron and Steel's Welding Rods is Not Bad

    A letter from Anshan Metal Structure Factory states: The article "Need for High-Quality Welding Rods" published in the People's Daily on August 8th mentioned that the quality of our factory's welding rods was not good. The Anshan Iron and Steel - 2 brand welding rods produced by our factory are manually coated, and their appearance is indeed not as good as those mechanically pressed by factories such as Shanghai Houcheng, but the quality still meets the technical specifications for manually coated welding rods. Since the trial production of this type of welding rod in 1954, more than 1,300 batches have been produced, and each batch has been tested to meet the technical requirements of the Soviet national standards. They have been used in key projects such as the Second Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, and the quality is also very good.

    Anshan Iron and Steel - 2 brand welding rods still have some shortcomings in appearance, which we urgently need to improve, and we are also preparing to add a press.

    Reasons for Poor Quality and High Prices

    A letter from the jointly owned public-private Guilin Zhongxin Boiler Factory states: The article "Poor Quality and High Prices of Local Industrial Products in Guilin" in the People's Daily on July 14th mentioned that the woks and pans produced by our factory were of poor quality and high price, which is true. The factory is taking measures to improve its work. However, we believe that the analysis of the reasons in this criticism article as "the factory leaders do not have strict demands on themselves" is somewhat one-sided. The main reason for the high cost of our factory's products is that raw materials and fuel must be transported from other places. Hunan coking coal costs more than 30 yuan per ton, but it costs more than 80 yuan per ton when transported to Guilin, which is more than 60% higher than in Hunan; Hunan scrap pig iron costs three yuan per 100 jin, but it sells for five yuan in Guilin, which is 40% higher than in Hunan. The price of our factory's woks is naturally higher than the price of woks in Hunan. In addition, we never said the sentence "There has never been a wok without sand (holes)."

    Ink Quality is Being Improved

    A letter from the state-owned Tianjin Jixing Ink Wholesale Department states: The letter from Xinhua Printing Factory published in the People's Daily on July 6th criticized the poor quality of our factory's ink. Our factory has sent personnel to Xinhua Printing Factory in Beijing to investigate. The inconsistent quality of our factory's blue ink is mainly due to the use of domestic raw materials in April, which resulted in a large difference in quality. We did not change the specifications and numbers, nor did we indicate the technical conditions, resulting in a large gap between products with the same specifications. In addition, the quality of this type of product will also vary depending on the production date.

    Currently, our factory has organized a special team to improve the quality and strengthen external contacts to overcome the above shortcomings.

    Punishment System Abolished Last Year

    The People's Daily published an article on August 4th titled "Fined Five Jin of Grain for Swearing Once," which mentioned that Zibo Mining Bureau's Zhai Li Mine adopted crude punishment measures in rectifying labor discipline. Comrade Gao Yiping, the director of Zhai Li Mine, has already sent a letter of self-criticism and explained that the erroneous punishment system such as "fined five jin of grain for swearing once" was abolished in July 1955.

### 对批评的反应

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    鞍钢电焊条质量不坏
    鞍山金属结构厂来信说：8月8日人民日报上发表的“需要质量好的电焊条”一文，提到我厂电焊条质量不好。我厂生产的鞍钢—2牌号电焊条，是手工涂粘的，外观形状确实不如上海厚诚等厂用机械压制的好，但质量仍是合乎手工涂粘电焊条的技术规格的。这种电焊条自1954年试制成功以来，已经生产了一千三百多批，经过检验每批都合乎苏联国家标准的技术要求，在鞍钢第二炼钢厂等重点工程上使用，质量也很好。
    鞍钢——2号牌电焊条外观形状等方面还存在若干缺点，亟待我们努力改进，我们也正在筹备增设压力机。
    质次价高原因在哪里
    公私合营桂林中新锅厂来信说：7月14日人民日报“桂林地方工业产品质次价高”一稿中谈到我厂出产鼎锅、扒锅质次价高，这是事实。厂里正采取措施，改进工作。但这篇批评稿在分析原因时说是“工厂领导人对自己的要求不严格”，我们认为是有些片面的。我们厂的产品成本高，主要原因是原料和燃料都要从外地运来。湖南焦煤每吨三十多元，运到桂林每吨要八十多元，比湖南高60％以上；湖南废生铁每一百斤三元，桂林却要卖五元，比湖南高40％，我厂锅价当然就比湖南锅价高。另外，“自古无砂（眼）不成鼎”这句话，我们也没有说过。
    油墨质量正在改进
    国营天津机星油墨批发处来信说：7月6日人民日报发表新华印刷厂的来信，批评我厂油墨质量不良，我厂已派员前往北京新华印刷厂了解。我厂蓝色油墨质量不一致，主要是在四月份换用了国产原料，质量有很大差别，我们既未更改规格编号，也未注明技术条件，致使规格相同的产品相距很大。另外这种品种出产日期不同，质量也会有差别。
    目前我厂已组织专门力量来改进质量，并加强对外联系，克服上述缺点。
  惩办制度去年已经废除
    8月4日本报发表“骂人一次罚粮五斤”一文，谈到淄博矿务局寨里矿在整顿劳动纪律中，采取粗暴的惩罚手段。寨里矿矿长高宜平同志已经来信作了检讨，并说明“骂人一次罚粮五斤”等错误的惩办制度，已在1955年7月废除。
