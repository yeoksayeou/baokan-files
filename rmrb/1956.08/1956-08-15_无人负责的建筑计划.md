    Unsupervised Construction Plan
    Wu Erxiang
    Not long ago, a new building appeared on Qixinggang in the suburbs of Guangzhou. It was the new family dormitory for cadres of the Guangzhou People's Bank's sanatorium. The originally planned construction area of this dormitory was 320 square meters, but after completion, it turned out to be 878 square meters, exceeding the original plan by more than one and a half times.
    How did this happen? According to the inspection by the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Supervision, the situation was as follows: In November of last year, the Guangzhou Municipal Planning Commission approved the Guangzhou People's Bank to build a family dormitory for cadres of a sanatorium, with a verified area of 320 square meters. The Guangzhou People's Bank then commissioned the Guangzhou Design Company to design it. The design company didn't ask the People's Bank how big a house they wanted to build or how many families would live there, and rashly suggested using the technical design standard drawing of another building. The cadres of the People's Bank present at the time heard that it was a standard drawing, so they didn't consider whether the construction area was appropriate, and didn't raise any objections. Later, this technical design drawing was reviewed by the Guangzhou People's Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Urban Construction Committee, but no one noticed the problem that the construction area was one and a half times larger. In fact, the first construction budget sheet of this technical design drawing clearly stated the construction area of the project. Even people who didn't understand basic construction business would have noticed the problem if they had looked at it a little more carefully. However, the problem was let go at every level, and it was never discovered. After construction started, no one paid attention to the issue of construction area. It wasn't until the project was about to be completed and the budget for the water and electricity installation was being calculated that it was discovered that the construction area exceeded the original plan by more than one and a half times. But it was too late; the state had already spent more than 27,000 yuan extra on this construction.
    Since an error occurred, responsibility must be investigated, but no one was willing to admit their mistake, so a "lawsuit" was filed, which lasted for several months. Look! The Guangzhou Municipal Urban Construction Committee said that the error occurred because of the People's Bank's bureaucracy, because they intentionally created a fait accompli, and because of their lack of organization and discipline. The Guangzhou People's Bank said that they didn't understand technology, so they shouldn't be blamed. The reason for the error was that the Guangzhou Design Company was irresponsible, and the Urban Construction Committee should also be responsible for not seriously reviewing it. As for the design company, they also had reasons to defend themselves. As a result, everyone had their own opinions and disputes continued. Finally, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Supervision convened multiple meetings, went to the site to understand the situation, and checked the archives before finding out the truth: the People's Bank should bear the main responsibility, and the design company and the Urban Construction Committee should also bear certain responsibilities. In the end, a notice was issued, requiring the relevant personnel to write self-criticisms and learn from the lessons.
    The problem was solved in this way. This should be said to be the easiest way to handle it. But it is said that some people are still not satisfied and are not very willing to write self-criticisms. Then, people have to ask: Why don't these comrades feel sorry for wasting so much of the country's wealth? If it is considered wrong to waste state property, then shouldn't a deep self-criticism be conducted and lessons learned from it?

    无人负责的建筑计划
    吴尔祥
    不久以前，广州市郊区七星岗上出现了一幢新的楼房。那是广州市人民银行新建的干部疗养所眷属宿舍。这座宿舍原来计划的建筑面积是三百二十平方公尺，建成以后却变成了八百七十八平方公尺，超过原计划一倍半以上。
    这是怎么回事呢？据广州市监察局检查，原来情况是这样的：去年十一月间广州市计划委员会批准市人民银行修建一座干部疗养所眷属宿舍，核定面积是三百二十平方公尺。市人民银行就委托广州市设计公司设计。设计公司没有问人民银行要建多大的房子、要住多少户眷属，就轻率地建议套用另一项建筑的技术设计标准图。当时在场的人民银行的干部听说是标准图，就没有去考虑建筑面积是否合适，也就没有提出反对的意见。后来，这份技术设计图样经过市人民银行审查，又经过广州市城市建设委员会审核，但是建筑面积大一倍半的问题谁都没有发现。其实，这份技术设计图样的第一张工程预算表上，就注明了工程建筑面积，即使不懂基本建设业务的人，只要稍为仔细看看，也会发现问题。然而，一道一道的关口都放过去了，问题始终没有被发现。到开工之后，更没有人去注意建筑面积的问题了。一直到工程即将完工，要核计水电装置预算的时候，才发现建筑面积超过原计划一倍半以上。但是已经太迟了，国家已经为这项建筑多花费了二万七千多元。
    错误发生了，当然要追究责任，但是谁也不肯认错，于是接下来就“打官司”，一打几个月。你看吧！广州市城市建设委员会说，这个错误的发生，是因为人民银行的官僚主义，是因为他们有意造成既成事实，是无组织无纪律的表现；广州市人民银行就说，他们不懂技术，不能归罪他们，发生错误的原因是广州市设计公司不负责任，城市建设委员会没有认真审核，也要负责；至于设计公司，也有为自己辩护的理由。结果是各持一词，争执不下。最后还是由广州市监察局召开了多次会议，并且到现场了解，翻查档案，才搞了一个水落石出：人民银行要负主要责任，设计公司和城市建设委员会，当然也要负一定的责任。最后是通报一下，要求有关人员写检讨，吸取教训。
    问题就这样解决了。这应该说是最轻松的处理办法了。但是据说有人还不满意，连检讨也不大愿意写。那末，人们要问：这些同志对浪费国家这么多财富为什么不心痛呢？如果认为浪费国家资财是不对的，那末，进行深刻的检讨，从中吸取教训，还不是应该的吗？
