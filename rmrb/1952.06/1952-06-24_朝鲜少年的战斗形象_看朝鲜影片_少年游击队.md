    The Korean people are in deep suffering. The Korean people are in the midst of brave and victorious battles, and in the majestic battle ranks, there is a line of young people.
    "Young Guerrilla Unit" is a film that reports on the tenacious struggle of Korean children against the American invading army. This film is very moving; it can inspire and educate people. We have translated it and are showing it in New China so that the image of the fighting Korea and the fighting Korean children that we care about can come alive before our eyes. If in the past we could only understand the suffering and fighting of the Korean people from news reports, now we can see these situations concretely. If we previously knew about the cruel and cowardly acts of murder and arson committed by the American invading army, now we can feel it. If we have seen the movie "The Young Guard" before, and recognized Oleg and other outstanding young men and women from Krasnodon on the screen, then from "Young Guerrilla Unit" we can recognize equally outstanding young heroes such as An Chuan, Choi Chang-ryong, Kim Seung-hwan, Lee Gwi-nam…
    At the beginning of the film, we are immediately confronted with the scene of the retreat of the Korean People's Army and the Korean people. The halo of the sun moved away from this free land, and a shadow temporarily enveloped it. The three young people watched this scene of retreat, watching the empty school playground without a single figure. They were very sad in their young hearts, but not sentimental. When Yu Guang-hwan, a platoon leader of the People's Army who was the last to retreat, bid farewell to the masses, he said: "This is a strategic retreat, and we will be back soon." This is not just "forcing a parting with comforting words," but every face and every heart expressed a firm belief in these words. This group of young people, with a deep love for their homeland and a reluctance to leave the school that was once their paradise, resolutely stayed behind.
    Staying behind was not empty waiting; staying behind was to organize themselves into a revenge-seeking fighting force. In this way, a great and solemn background was laid out from the beginning, and the arduous struggle of these seven young people began.
    The film vividly tells us that these seven young people established their own fighting organization, solemnly took an oath, and demanded of themselves extremely strict discipline, engaging in the struggle against the American imperialist bandits with a spirit of rather sacrificing themselves than wavering. They acted bravely, resourcefully, and resolutely, and they finally gloriously completed their combat missions under extremely difficult conditions, and in the final victorious chorus, the moving voices of these young people also resounded.
    In this film, although the activities of these heroic young people are given a more prominent presentation, they are not isolatedly and exaggeratedly portrayed as unrealistic legendary figures. On the contrary, they are placed in a very suitable position. The battle is a whole, and they are a part of it. From their specific activities, the leading role of the Korean Workers' Party in the struggle, the coordinated operations of the guerrillas and the People's Army, especially the heinous bloody atrocities of the American invading army and the traitors, and the deep hatred of the broad masses of people towards them and their love for their motherland, are reflected more vividly. All of this, mutually acting as conditions of dependence, naturally and harmoniously forms an organic whole. All of this is not simply laid out in parallel, but all events are connected by the activities of the young guerrilla team as a line. In this way, the typical images of these young people are highlighted, and the emotional power of art is brought into play.
    The American invading army and the traitors' activities of massacring, suppressing, and insulting the Korean people occupy many scenes in the film, but the effect it causes is not fear of these beasts' "might," but a feeling that they are hateful, shameful, and ridiculous. In contrast to the young guerrilla members, the latter's bravery and invincibility are even more highlighted. This point is particularly clear in the two scenes of Kim Seung-hwan being interrogated and shot. These are two very tense and moving scenes. We look at the fat, sturdy face of this young fighter, and the feelings of justice, determination, hatred, and anger coat it like steel. He is so lovely! So admirable! So majestic, sacred, and inviolable! His eyes, like torches, shoot out poisonous flames at the enemy. The clanging sound of shackles grows closer step by step, and the heavy, solemn air makes us hold our breath. We saw his face. This face, magnified and magnified, cannot be contained by the entire screen. The people who interrogated him changed several times, and the interrogation tricks changed several times, but he always had that strong face! His words were always those few sentences. The words, like a hammer striking an anvil, struck the enemy loudly and powerfully. At this time, the one being truly interrogated was not this outstanding son of the Korean people, but his enemy. Finally, although he fell under a big tree after a gunshot, we felt that he was still standing tall and heroic.
    The Korean people's love for their motherland and their hatred for the American invading army and the traitors is expressed very clearly in this film. Although they are trapped under the rule of the enemy puppets, they firmly believe that the People's Army will return soon. That old grandfather was right: "Can the moon be eaten by dogs?" "Koreans are not weathercocks." They secretly read the leaflets posted by the young guerrilla members, and the good news made them reveal their inner emotions on their faces. The scene of the American invading army commander forcibly dragging the masses to listen to his "instructions" is really delightful; the support of the people's hearts does not need to be expressed in words. They used refusal to applaud, silence, and disdainful expressions and condescending glances to express their resistance to the enemy. Let's listen to the roar of Lee Gwi-nam's mother after her son was killed!
    "Can everything in the world be solved by shooting people? Is it all right if you kill us? Behind us are hundreds of millions of people, and they will definitely settle this blood debt with you. Victory must be..." Although the gunshot cut off her last voice, this voice is forever resounding, because it is the voice of truth.
    As shown in this film, these young guerrilla members, fighting the enemy with such arduous and outstanding actions, the cause they created is simply unlike what children of their age can do. To ask what is the source of this fighting force? The answer is: boundless love for the motherland and boundless hatred for the enemy. The scene of Gwi-nam recalling the grand occasion of the "May Day" festival concentratedly expresses the free and happy life after liberation. The flowers, the flower-like ranks of young people, the dance expressing the joy of life; the loud sound of the moving song of General Kim Il-sung. This is a new life. Children and people all over Korea love this kind of life. When Gwi-nam wakes up from his memory, the life in front of him is another kind of life. Freedom has been replaced by shackles, joy has turned into grief and indignation, and love for the motherland has turned into hatred for the enemy. Although they, these young guerrilla members, are very young, they are by no means acting blindly out of temporary enthusiasm. What guides their actions is a clear love and hatred, and a deep thought. When Cheng-huan answered the enemy's question, "Who told you to do it?" he said, "It was you, it was your beastly behavior that told me." When the American invading army's adjutant had nothing to do with him, he said such a sentence: "This child is too deeply poisoned by communism." If we change the word "poison" to "ideological education," this sentence is indeed true. The fact that the Korean Labor Party member, Teacher Park, who used to teach them and now leads the guerrillas, is their organizer and leader; and that Captain Choi Chang-ryong and Kim Seung-hwan and Song Hao-min, who first appeared with him in the film, are all from workers' families, are not trivial matters. It provides convincing possibilities for the ideological roots of why these young people became heroes. With this kind of class stand, they can be so determined and unwilling to submit to death when fighting against national enemies and the national scum who depend on them.
    This great patriotic spirit is inevitably linked with internationalist spirit. Cheng-huan said to the enemy: "People all over the world who oppose American imperialism are our friends." Before his sacrifice, he firmly believed that the peace-loving people of the world would definitely be able to defeat American imperialism.
    Although this film is a feature film, it is not fabricated out of thin air. Reading "The Young Pioneer Guard"—the true story of Park Jin-soo, the captain of this Korean "Young Pioneer Guard"—one can see some shadows of the characters in it. Chinese audiences, especially young people, will surely draw a fighting force from the protagonists of this film, strengthen their hatred for our common enemy—the American invaders, and contribute all they have to defend and build the motherland.

    朝鲜少年的战斗形象
    ——看朝鲜影片“少年游击队”
    臧克家
    朝鲜人民在水深火热的苦难里。朝鲜人民在英勇的胜利的战斗中，在雄伟的战斗的队伍里，有着少年的行列。
    “少年游击队”就是报道朝鲜少年们同美国侵略军进行顽强斗争的一部影片。这部影片，很动人，它能鼓舞人，教育人。我们把它翻译过来，在新中国放映，使我们所关怀着的战斗的朝鲜、战斗的朝鲜少年的形象，活现在我们的眼前。如果过去我们只能从一些新闻消息上去了解朝鲜人民的苦难和战斗，那么，现在我们可以具体地看到这些情况了；如果我们过去对于美国侵略军杀人放火的残酷、卑怯行为只是知道，现在却可以感到了。如果以前我们看过电影“青年近卫军”，从银幕上认识了奥列格等克拉斯诺顿的优秀的青年男女，那么，从“少年游击队”里我们可以认识同样出色的安川英雄少年：崔昌龙，金承焕，李贵男……
    电影一开幕，我们劈头便碰上了朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民撤退的场面。太阳的光圈从这自由的土地上移开了，一片阴影暂时地笼罩下来。三个少年望着这撤退的光景，望着自己学校的操场上空洞洞的没有一个人影，他们幼小的心里很难过，但不感伤。最后撤退的人民军的一个排长于广焕和群众握别的时候说：“这是战略的撤退，不久就会回来。”这不是什么“强说重来慰别情”，每一张脸，每一颗心，都表示着对这句话的坚定的信心。这群少年，怀着对自己乡土深厚的爱和对于曾经是自己的乐园的学校的留恋，坚决地留了下来。
    留了下来，并不是空空的等待，留了下来是为了把自己组织成复仇的战斗队伍。就这样，一开头，一个伟大严肃的背景就排列开来，这七个少年的坚苦斗争从此开始。
    影片形象地告诉了我们，这七个少年成立了自己的战斗组织，庄严的宣了誓，他们以极严格的纪律要求自己，以宁愿牺牲也决不动摇的精神去从事与美帝国主义强盗的斗争。他们作得又勇敢，又机智，又坚决，他们终于在极端艰苦的条件下光荣地完成了自己的战斗任务，在最后的胜利的大合唱中，也响动着这些少年们动人的声音。
    在这个影片里，虽然对于这些英雄少年的活动作了比较凸出的表现，但并没有孤立地夸张地把他们形容成为不合实际的传奇式的人物，恰好相反，他们是被安放在一个很合适的地位上的。战斗是一个整体，他们是其中的一部分。从他们的具体活动里，反映出朝鲜劳动党在斗争中的领导作用，游击队和人民军的配合作战，特别是美国侵略军和叛徒们的令人发指的血腥暴行，及广大人民对他们的彻骨憎恨和对于自己祖国的热爱，反映得更为鲜明。这一切，互相作为依存的条件，自然地，和谐地结成一个有机体。这一切，又不是平列地铺舒开，所有事件以少年游击队的活动作为一条线贯串了起来。这样，便凸出了这些少年们的典型形象，发挥出艺术的感动力量。
    美国侵略军和叛徒们对朝鲜人民进行屠杀、镇压和侮辱的活动，在影片中占了很多的场面，但它引起的效果不是对这些野兽们“威风”的畏惧，而是觉得他们可恨、可耻、可笑，拿这和少年游击队员对比起来，越发衬出后者的英勇和不可战胜。这一点，在金承焕被审问被枪杀的这两个场景上表现得特别清楚。这是十分紧张，十分动人的两个场景。我们看着这个少年战斗者的胖胖的结实的脸子，正义的、坚决的、憎恨的、愤怒的感情把它镀得像钢铁一样，他是那么可爱！那么可敬！那么威严神圣不可侵犯！他的双眼，火炬似的面对着敌人射出毒烈的焰光。啷噹的脚镣声，一步一步的近了，沉重的、森严的空气使我们屏住了气息。我们看到了他的脸子。这脸子，扩大起来，扩大起来，整个幕布容不下它了。审问他的人换了好几个，审问的花样几度变过，他，始终是那张坚强的脸子！他的话也始终是那么几句。话，像铁锤敲击着铁砧一样，响亮地有力地敲击着敌人。这时候，真正被审问的不是这个朝鲜人民优秀的儿子，而是他的敌人。末了，虽然在一声枪响之后他倒在一棵大树底下了，但我们觉得他依然崇高地英勇地挺立着。
    朝鲜人民热爱祖国，对美国侵略军和叛徒们的憎恨在这个影片上表现得再清楚不过了。他们虽然陷在敌伪的统治下，但是他们坚决相信人民军不久一定会回来。那位老祖父说得对：“月亮还能叫狗吃了？”“朝鲜人不是墙头草”。他们偷看少年游击队员贴的传单，好消息使他们把心里的情感表露到脸上来；美国侵略军的团长强拉群众去听他“训话”的场面真是叫人开心，人心的向背是不须用话语来表示的。他们用拒绝鼓掌，用沉默，用不屑的神情和卑睨的眼色表示了对敌人的反抗。我们听一听李贵男的母亲在自己的儿子被害之后发出的怒吼吧！
    “世界上的事情都可以用枪毙来解决吗？杀了我们就没事了吗？在我们身后有几万万人民，他们一定要向你们清算这血债，胜利一定是……”虽然枪声截断了她最后的声音，这声音却是永远响着，因为它是一个真理的声音。
    如这个影片上所表现的，这几个少年游击队员，以这样坚苦卓绝的行动同敌人去作斗争，他们作出的事业简直不像他们这样年龄的孩子所能作出的，要追问这种战斗力量的源泉是什么？回答是：对祖国无限的热爱和对敌人无限的憎恨。贵男回忆“五一”节盛况那一幕，集中地表现了解放后的自由快乐的生活情景。那鲜花，那鲜花似的少年队伍，那表现生之欢腾的舞蹈；那动人的金日成将军之歌的宏亮声音。这是一种新的生活。少年儿童们，全朝鲜的人民热爱这种生活。当贵男从回忆中醒过来的时候，眼前另是一种生活。自由换成了枷锁，欢乐化成了悲愤，对祖国的热爱，变成了对敌人的仇恨。他们，这些少年游击队员，年岁虽然很幼小，但是他们决不是出于一时热情的冲动，盲目的行动起来。指导他们行动的是一种分明的爱憎、深刻的思想。承焕回答敌人“谁叫你干的？”这句问话时说：“是你们，是你们的野兽行为告诉我的。”美国侵略军的副官对他无可如何的时候说过这样一句话：“这个孩子中共产主义的毒太深”，如果我们把这个“毒”字改成“思想教育”，这句话倒是的确的。把以前教过他们的，现在领导游击队的朝鲜劳动党员朴老师作为他们的组织者、领导人；队长崔昌龙和他最先一同在影片上出现的金承焕，宋浩民都是出身工人的家庭，这都不是等闲的事情，对于这些少年之所以成为英雄，在思想根源上提供了令人信服的种种可能。有了这种阶级立场，在对民族敌人和依附它的民族败类进行斗争的时候，才能够那么坚决，宁死也不屈。
    这种伟大的爱国主义精神又必然和国际主义精神连结在一起。承焕对敌人说：“全世界反对美帝国主义的人民，都是我们的朋友。”在牺牲之前，他坚决相信全世界的和平人民一定能够把美帝国主义打倒。
    这个影片虽然是一部故事片，但它并不是凭空虚构出来的，读一下“少先近卫队”——这个朝鲜“少先近卫队”队长朴金素的真实故事，可以从中看出一些人物的影子。中国的观众，特别是青年少年们，一定会从这个片子主角们的身上吸取一种战斗力量，加强对我们共同的敌人——美国侵略者的憎恨，为保卫祖国、建设祖国贡献出自己所有的一切。
