    Large Batch of Windmills Manufactured by the Huai Bei Salt Bureau Are Unusable

    Editor: The Huai Bei Salt Bureau invested 300 million yuan in manufacturing water pumps, but the products were all unusable. This issue did not attract the attention of the Bureau's leadership. Afterwards, without proper research and testing, they used another 2.1 billion yuan to manufacture 700 new-style windmills in Dapu. From March 20th, these windmills were successively distributed to various fields, locations, weirs, and beaches. The salt workers were extremely excited and made plans to increase production and economize, based on the expected performance of the new-style windmills. However, many of these windmills are unusable. Some parts do not fit together; others are damaged by strong winds. On May 15th, the Huai Bei Salt Bureau issued a notice stating: "The new-style windmills cannot be used due to faults in the iron parts and should be temporarily stored." After seeing this notice, the staff and salt workers of our Liena field all believe that this is the result of the leadership's bureaucratic work style. Currently, many beach areas are experiencing a severe water shortage due to the windmills being ineffective, which is affecting production. For example, two-thirds of the salt fields in Guanshui field are short of water. We suggest that the Huai Bei Salt Bureau quickly resolve this issue.

    淮北盐务管理局
    制造的大批风车不能用
    编辑同志：淮北盐务管理局曾投资三亿元制造抽水机，但是产品都不能用。这个问题没有引起该局领导方面注意。以后他们没有很好研究、试验，又用二十一亿元的资金，在大浦制造新式风车七百辆。从三月二十日起，这些风车陆续发到各场、所、圩、滩。盐工们都兴奋极了，纷纷按照新式风车应该发挥的作用，作了增产节约计划。可是，这些风车很多是不能用的。有的配合不起来；有的遇到较大的风就损坏了。五月十五日，淮北盐务管理局发出通知说：“新式风车因铁件发生故障，不能使用，暂时保存。”我们埒南所的职员和盐工看了这个通知后，都认为这是领导方面的官僚主义作风造成的结果。现在，很多滩地因风车失效，缺水情况很严重，影响了生产。比如灌水场就有三分之二的盐田缺水。我们建议淮北盐务管理局迅速解决这个问题。        　小劲
