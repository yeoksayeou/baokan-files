Editor's Note: On June 11th and 12th, Shanghai's "Liberation Daily" successively published articles such as "A Worker's Opinion on Literary and Art Workers" and "What Do Shanghai Workers Require of Literary and Art Workers?" The latter is a record of a symposium of active workers in literary and artistic activities in Shanghai. We are reprinting it below (with slight changes to the title and paragraphing). From this, we can see that Shanghai workers are very concerned about the orientation of literary and art work towards workers and the combination of literary and art workers and workers. Their opinions should not only be valued by the literary and art circles in Shanghai, but, just as the report on the Beijing Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Literary and Art Symposium published in this newspaper not long ago, should also be valued by literary and art workers and literary and art organizations in other places. They should be studied and discussed; and in conjunction with the literary and art rectification study, examine their own work and make specific plans to improve their work, so that our literature and art can better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers.

I. The Vigorous Development of Workers' Literary and Artistic Activities in Shanghai
	Over the past three years, the workers' literary and artistic movement in Shanghai has made great progress. Looking at city-wide activities alone, worker drama festivals have been held twice, singing competitions have been held twice, and a sports dance conference has been held once. More than 2,000 people from the Yong'an Cotton Mill participated in the singing competition, and the two drama festivals had more than 100,000 spectators. Workers have rich creative talents. Of the more than 200 drama programs performed, more than half were created by the workers themselves. The themes of the works are all directly taken from political life, labor production, and workers' lives, including: resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, opposing the US arming Japan, production competitions, literacy campaigns, labor insurance, marriage issues, and so on. The forms of expression include opera, drama, skits, Peking opera, Yue opera, singing, comic dialogues, acrobatics... and fifteen other types. In the past three years, the organization of worker literary and art groups has also greatly increased and developed in many ways. When the first Shanghai Literary and Art Workers Congress was held in July 1950, there were only more than 230 cultural work troupes led by the trade union, with more than 16,300 participants; at present, various cultural and entertainment groups (including cultural work troupes, drama troupes, song and dance troupes, orchestras, etc.) have developed to 6,230, with more than 110,000 workers participating. There are more than 800 clubs in the grassroots organizations of various districts and industrial trade unions. These are all concrete manifestations of the urgent demand for literary and artistic activities by Shanghai workers after liberation.
	In these activities, many worker writers have emerged. A worker from Shenxin No. 6 Mill, who originally could not write articles, has now created more than 20 local opera scripts through tireless study. Worker Cheng Yunxiong said: "There is an elderly worker in our factory who is illiterate. He was very happy after liberation. The machines turned quickly, and he sang quickly. One day he sang and sang, and sang a song: 'The Five-Star Red Flag is red and red, China has Mao Zedong, helping peasants to divide the land, and workers have become masters.' Later, this song won an award, and many workers followed him to learn to sing and create." Some workers who originally did not recognize musical notes have now learned to create songs. When many workers in Huxi worked hard to learn to create songs, they put forward the slogan of "learning from the volunteers to shoot down airplanes," and their creative attitude was also very serious. Zhou Xiaoliang from Shanghai Electric Power Company said: "There are many creative talents among the workers. Once, on a small coal-carrying steamship on the Huangpu River, I saw many cartoons drawn by the workers themselves hanging in the office. But these cartoons were not noticed by the experts."
	However, judging from the needs of Shanghai's one million workers and the uneven development of worker literary and artistic activities in various factories, Shanghai's worker literary and artistic work is still far from meeting the actual needs of the workers.

II. Opinions on General Literary and Artistic Works
	The quality of a literary work has a great impact on workers. Jiang Xingchang from the Second Garment Factory said: "When workers saw the volunteers in the 'Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea' films, climbing mountains in the freezing cold, tearing their clothes, and enduring the cold to chase and kill the enemy, everyone was very moved. Therefore, they are not sloppy in making clothes and must make them strong; if they find problems with the ones they made before, they immediately take them back for repairs. Everyone said: 'We must improve product quality, and we will be sorry to the front-line volunteers if we don't do well.'" Cheng Yunxiong from Shenxin No. 6 Mill said: "Workers love to watch 'Boundless Radiance.' The elderly female workers in our factory not only became more active in production after watching it, but also improved their vigilance against special agents. When some people came to the workshop, she would question them." Workers from the Electric Power Company watched this film and repaired generators with great energy. Good works are like this, making workers love to watch them and effectively educating them. However, if the writer has ideological problems or does not work seriously, and the works produced are not good, it will have a very bad effect on the workers and affect their enthusiasm for production. Wang Weishan from Zhicheng Cloth Factory said: "For a period of time, many anti-Afei (In Shanghai before and after liberation, some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois youths were poisoned by the 'culture' of American imperialism, and imitated the non-working, ruffian-like people in some American Western movies in their clothing and lifestyle, called 'Afei' - Editor's note) comic dramas highlighted the greasy and glibness of the Afei, and flaunted many gimmicks. As a result, the stage actually became not anti-Afei, but rather promoting Afei. Afei can no longer be seen on the road, but the Afei on the stage are playing a bad role. A worker in our factory, after watching this kind of play, often imitated the tone of Afei, wearing his hat crookedly, putting his hands on his hips, and making all kinds of strange gestures, which affected the workers' production mood." The workers unanimously protested strongly against this kind of unhealthy content, saying: "We must never tolerate this kind of harmful play!"
	Before attending the symposium, Yang Qishun from Xiangchang Machine Factory solicited opinions from the workers, asking everyone which films depicting workers they liked. The workers said: "Count on your fingers, there are less than ten films depicting workers in the past three years." "The good ones are only 'Boundless Radiance,' 'Singing Triumphant Advance,' and 'Bridge.'" Workers generally feel that there are too few works depicting workers, and even fewer good ones. In terms of novels, the workers said, it is even scarcer. After thinking about it, the workers can only mention Cao Ming's "Original Power," which is a book that workers still relatively like to read. Wang Weishan expressed his opinion on musical creation, saying: "There are not many songs that workers like to listen to. The ones that are often sung are only 'The East is Red,' 'We Workers Have Power,' 'Unity is Strength,' 'Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battle Song,' 'People of the World Unite Tightly,' 'Ode to the Motherland,' 'People of the World are of One Mind,' 'Chinese and Soviet People Unite Tightly'...etc." "There are not many songs that generally match the production movement, and even fewer songs that describe workers' lives. For example, there are many textile workers across the country, and their enthusiasm for production has been very high since liberation, but to this day there is not a single song that sings about their own lives."
	The workers gave their opinions one after another, saying: Writers seem to not see or care about the vigorous struggles and heroic deeds of the workers. Tang Kexin from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 said: "In the three years since liberation, Shanghai workers have gone through the 'February 6th' anti-bombing and anti-blockade struggle in 1950, overcome many difficulties in production; in 1951, they went through major struggles such as the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea production competition, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and democratic reforms. There are endless stories to tell. But why is there no reflection of this in literary and artistic works? Perhaps writers have difficulties, but very few writers go to the factories. Last year, some writers paid attention to these issues and began to go deep into the factories, but to this day there are still no works." Ji Jinsui from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 10 said: "Some writers in Shanghai are very busy. Sometimes they give reports, saying how to write, how to write, and talk eloquently, but they have never been seen to write articles. Only a little poem is published after the parade, and they are all old clich√©s such as 'red flags'...etc., which are not energetic to read." The workers eagerly hope to see the new face of the motherland from literary and artistic works, but this also makes them very disappointed. Zhou Xiaoliang said: "Old workers love the motherland and want to see how the motherland is prospering and advancing. They said that it would be good to be able to see the great project of repairing the Huai River in dramas and movies, but until now, their hopes have not been satisfied." The workers all said that the writers cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation, and their labor cannot meet the needs of the masses!
	Some literary and art workers have also written some works reflecting workers' lives, but many of the works are formulas and slogans. Workers speak a lot of theories and dogmas, without emotion. When writing about the transformation of characters, the backward ones are written prominently, and the positive ones are written without strength. Especially the works that are rushed out temporarily, this shortcoming is even more serious. Wang Weishan said: "The songs in the Five-Anti movement, because the writers did not understand the workers' thoughts and feelings, are mostly without emotion, with many slogans and many nouns, such as 'Go up the mountain to fight the tiger, go up the mountain to fight the tiger,' 'Launch a vigorous campaign, launch a vigorous campaign,' who wants to sing it?" Some writers pay attention to the permanent value of their works, so they are not serious or unwilling to write short works that workers like and that match tasks. Zhang Guoxi from Yong'an Cotton Mill said: "We believe that creating works to match the movement is necessary. It doesn't matter if it is not used tomorrow. If your work plays a role today, it has value. But rushing tasks is not a simple matter. If the writers are not familiar with the workers, they will not be able to rush tasks well."
	Some works often distort the image of workers and distort workers' lives. Tang Kexin said: "When writing about the image of workers, the workers always open their mouths wide, laugh hahaha. When they stretch out their fists, they are always rough, and their thoughts and feelings are always vulgar. In fact, our workers are not like this. They have not seen the fine qualities of the working class; especially in the three years since liberation, under the education of the Party and various movements, many workers have greatly improved their class consciousness and political culture. They have endless wisdom and creative ability. There are also many workers who can create. Because the writers have ideological problems, they always see workers as simple and vulgar. They are interested in some of the workers' backward and rude aspects, and think they are 'typical.' How can this not distort the workers?"
	Even some works that are not too bad, the workers feel that they do not write about the heroic spirit of the workers' struggle. Some plays write about the miserable lives of the working people being oppressed by the reactionary rule when they overthrow the reactionary rule, but the resistance and struggle of the working people are not expressed vividly and forcefully. This makes the workers feel uncomfortable: Is our workers' fighting spirit so poor? This is not in line with the facts.
	The workers put forward specific criticisms of works that distort the image of workers and distort reality. Tang Kexin pointed out that "Peace Dove" writes the workers as so stupid, so non-compliant with the system, with a plaster cast on his injured leg, still jumping around in the factory, the author is clearly making fun of the workers. Liu Shuying also raised an opinion on "Peace Dove": "The movie depicts steel workers as thieves. The working class does not have such disorganized and undisciplined people. If someone in our factory is injured at work, the factory director and the Party committee will definitely send someone to visit; but in the movie, there is a worker who secretly goes to the hospital to send a bottle of medicine." Ding He'ying said: "Workers said after watching the workers in the Yue opera 'Human Face and Beast Heart': 'This is not our worker, like a young lady in a high building, so weak.'" Some workers also believe that the workers in the film "Unite to Tomorrow" do not act like workers. Cheng Yunxiong criticized the movie "Unlimited Love": "That kind of petty-bourgeois charity everywhere to the workers and the poor is really an insult to us." Zou Guisheng pointed out the shortcomings of the play "Wedding" compiled by the Yue Opera Editing and Directing Association: "The play writes that the workers owe the landlord rent, which is also an insult. The workers have been living very well after liberation and will not owe rent at all."
	The workers expressed their dissatisfaction with the writers' inability to express the workers well and their distortion of the image of the workers. Tang Kexin earnestly said: "In the future, writers should carefully check why they are interested in those very few backward things, and do not pay attention to the vivid stories and model figures in the factory, and insist on making the workers look ugly?"

III. Opinions on Popular Literary Works and Creative Forms
	Workers are busy with production and like to watch short and popular literary works, such as jingles, clappers, ditties, comic dialogues, short singing words of local operas, short plays, comic strips, etc. However, this aspect has not been valued by general writers. For example, the workers' favorite is comic strips, and Yong'an Cotton Mill has to add hundreds of new ones every month. However, the current comic strips cannot satisfy the workers. There are too few works that take the stories of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and the stories of worker production as themes, and there are phenomena of shoddy work and disguised versions. There are also many comic strips with toxic content. Such as: "Secret History of the Qing Palace," "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian," etc., some are adapted from toxic old films and published with a new name.
	Songs have a great encouraging power for workers' labor production and political struggle. Workers like short and powerful songs. Yang Qishun said: "He had such an experience in the 'Five-Anti' movement. He taught everyone to sing short songs such as 'Where Are You Running, Cunning Merchants' and 'Two Roads for You to Choose,' and the mood was very high. The workers took the initiative to ask: Teach us another song! Everyone learned it, and young and old sang it, spreading the singing everywhere in the workshop and at the conference." However, many musicians always like to write songs for two-part and four-part chorus. Workers have no appetite for these complicated and long songs, and no one sings them, so they do not play a role. Some people also pointed out that the song collections and music books published by the Shanghai branch of the Central Conservatory of Music and professors are all printed with staff notation, and there are very few numbered musical notations. Sometimes workers want to buy one to read, but they cannot understand it. Therefore, it is hoped that composers will understand and meet the actual needs of the masses.
	Literary works are one of the main forms of literature and art, but the popularization work in this area is very poor. Literary and art workers have not attached importance to writing some popular and well-loved things for the workers. The workers said: "Some works are written too deeply now. They are not like the speeches and articles of Chairman Mao and some leaders, with many metaphors, vivid and popular, easy to listen to and easy to understand." Wang Weishan said: "Some works are in Western style, with inverted sentences, which the workers are not used to. Why not use forms that are easy for the Chinese people to understand?" The workers hope to read world literary classics and suggest strengthening and improving the work of rewriting and translating popular editions. Tang Kexin said: "At present, we do not have much of our own creation, and translated works are difficult to read. It is very necessary to rewrite translated works into popular editions. Rewriting should not be procrastinated. The main parts of the work and the current related issues can be written in a storytelling style, which should be systematic and not messy, and easy to read. The popular editions I have read, such as 'How the Steel Was Tempered' and 'Days and Nights,' are relatively good. Shaburov in 'Days and Nights' is very vivid and does not differ much from the original. Doing a good job in rewriting popular editions can play a role in promoting factory literature and art."
	The workers also pointed out that some translated Soviet films are translated in too profound language.

IV. Literary and Artistic Work Should First Serve the Workers
	Many worker comrades put forward opinions from specific literary and artistic work, such as theaters, performances, and service attitudes, believing that Shanghai's literary and artistic work has not taken good care of workers' cultural life. This also shows that literary and art workers lack a clear view of literature and art serving the working class in their thinking.
	Shanghai's factories are mostly concentrated in Pudong and Puxi, which are also where many workers and their families live, while Shanghai's cinemas, theaters and other cultural and entertainment venues are concentrated in the city center, and the worker areas only have a few second- and third-rate small cinemas, small theaters, stage theaters, and open-air theaters. This was originally an extremely unreasonable phenomenon in colonial Shanghai under the rule of imperialism. After liberation, the leading organs of Shanghai's literary and artistic work have paid attention to this point, such as building workers' theaters in Puxi and building "Hengshan Cinema" in Xuhui District. We hope to continue this direction with greater strength in the future. Today, the appearance of cultural and entertainment venues in worker areas has not been given the due change. Lin Chengzhong said: "Some small stage theaters in Pudong perform some yellow and vulgar things. They often perform local operas such as 'Biluo Huangquan,' 'Fan Lihua,' 'Nine Beauties Picture,' 'Lu Yachen,' 'Wu Zetian,' and 'Oil Seller and the Courtesan,' which have not been reformed. They are mostly old content such as 'the fallen son-in-law who became a champion, and the private engagement in the back garden,' and some have committed the mistake of distorting the history of the struggle of the working people." Ding He'ying said: "We watched the film 'White-Haired Girl' and increased our hatred for feudal landlords, but those small theaters are promoting feudal ideology." Some folk arts are called innovative comic duets, but they are full of gimmicks. Lin Chengzhong said: "I hope the leading comrades of literary and artistic work will attach importance to and strengthen the work of transforming them, and help them reform the content of their performances. Don't just pay attention to the few big troupes in the central area." Ding He'ying said: "Although our workers will not follow the characters in these bad plays, we should have good ones to watch."
	Workers are very eager to see some good plays performed in the theaters in the central area. Railway worker Yin Xiquan said: "Workers want to watch 'Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,' but they have to queue up to buy tickets, and the workers simply don't have time. The group tickets with a 20% discount are mostly bought by housewives and neighborhood residents." Cheng Yunxiong said: "Good plays should first meet the workers. But we often have to make a big decision to watch plays. The workers in our factory watched 'In Front of New Things' performed by Lanxin Theater. They couldn't buy tickets and didn't have time to queue up, so they asked people living near the theater to buy them on their behalf. After watching the play, there were no cars late at night, and everyone called a taxi together to return to Pudong." The workers all said that the taxi fare for watching a play cost more than the ticket. As for new movies, the workers only see them when they are shown in the second- and third-rate cinemas in Puxi and Pudong. The workers said: This situation should be changed.
	The workers criticized the state-owned professional troupes for not performing in worker areas. Ye Qingjiang, a cultural and educational cadre of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "There are many state-owned troupes in Shanghai, but they rarely go to the districts and factories to perform. Some troupes are reluctant to leave the Lanxin Theater, but Lanxin only has more than 700 seats, while Shanghai has more than one million workers. Pudong and Puxi both have workers' clubs and venues. Sometimes the trade unions invite them to perform, but they are not very willing to go. They have not truly recognized that their main service objects are the workers, and they only like the beautiful venue of Lanxin."
	Many factory workers believe that the China Film Management Company, East China Branch, does not have enough spirit of serving the workers. The workers often cannot rent the films they hope to see, and the company is sometimes just perfunctory and does not work seriously. Zou Guisheng said: "Once I rented a film whose content could match the conference held in the factory, but it was agreed upon, but it was not given temporarily. The company gave us some confused and unclear old films."

V. Literary and Art Workers Should Combine with the Worker Masses
	The workers said that in the past few years, many literary and art workers have come to the factory to experience life and have gained some gains in ideological transformation and creation, and the workers have also received a lot of help; however, some literary and art workers have not gained anything. Some of them forgot that they were going to transform their thinking, but came to the factory specifically to collect materials and engage in their own creation; some came to the factory as cultural guests with the idea that "I am a writer, I am here to experience life"; some came as literary and artistic mentors; and some were only assigned by the organization and did not want to come to the factory on their own initiative.
	If literary and art workers do not first take down their airs after entering the factory, and always regard themselves as leaders, how can they talk about transformation? Zhang Guoxi said: "Some literary and art workers still put on the airs of guiding others: 'I can sing, I can do plays, you call some people, and I will help you rehearse the plays.'" Cheng Yunxiong said: "I hope that literary and art workers do not see the backwardness of individual workers and think that there is nothing to learn, and say that the working class cannot be the leading class. In fact, the class nature of the workers is very clear. For example, in the 'Five-Anti' movement, when fighting with the bosses, the workers showed a high degree of fighting enthusiasm and a firm class stand. But some literary and art workers still 'respectfully' smiled and could not bring themselves to speak out at the struggle occasions when they met the bosses. You see, isn't the difference in class stand very obvious?"
	Similarly, if writers do not recognize the significance of going to the factory to transform their thinking from the ideological level, and strive to establish the view of wholeheartedly serving the working class, even if they go to the place where the masses are struggling, they will not change their lifestyle, go deep into the struggle of the masses, and integrate with the thoughts and feelings of the masses. The workers enthusiastically put forward many criticisms and suggestions in this regard. Ye Qingjiang said: "Last year, a literary and art worker was experiencing life in the factory. He did not go to the workshop, but went to the office every day, with a cup of tea and a book, chatting with senior staff. After work, he went to the homes of senior staff to play, and he had a very good relationship with senior staff. On factory rest days, others went to visit the families of workers, but he went home or slipped away to Suzhou to play." Yu Jiancheng from Shenxin No. 9 Mill said: "In 1950, a writer came to our factory to experience life. He came for more than a month, and the workers asked strangely when they saw him: Who is this person? Someone answered that he was a young writer. The workers wanted to talk to him, but they couldn't find him anywhere." Some literary and art workers have to wait for others to introduce them before meeting the workers, and do not take the initiative to warmly care about the workers' labor and life, and care about the big and small things that happen among the workers. They still stick to the "kingdom" of intellectuals in their thoughts and feelings, and therefore, always interact with the workers with the tone of intellectuals. Cheng Yunxiong said: "When writers and reporters come to the factory, they always start with 'starting from ideological viewpoints,' 'raising to the height of principles,' and what 'purpose and requirements' to achieve, and the workers don't want to listen to it." These incorrect attitudes of the writers directly hinder their combination with the worker masses. "When workers sing their own songs in labor, they don't sing when the writer comes." Wang Weishan said: "When writers go to the factory, they should truly integrate with the masses. It's not simply that I teach you culture, and you give me life, this kind of deal. Writers should live completely among the workers, and cannot engage in guerrilla warfare, otherwise they cannot become confidants with each other. When writers are with workers, don't be afraid to expose your thoughts and shortcomings, just expose them boldly, so that everyone can help you, and you can make up your mind to dig to the root and constantly transform yourself."
	The workers also asked the writers who came to the factory to give them some practical help in their literary and artistic life. Like some literary and art workers in the past who came to the factory, they only cared about locking themselves in the office to write a few scenes of the script. They smoked a pack of cigarettes, and when the workers asked them to read what they wrote, they only said: Good! Good! In fact, they didn't even look at it. When asked to help rehearse the play, they also said: "No, we want to learn from you." and turned it down. Some writers are subjectively enthusiastic about helping others, but when they talk about it, they talk about clothing, actors' waists, and a set of theories, which is of no help to the workers.

VI. Opinions on Worker Literary and Art Guidance Work and Leadership Work
	Worker comrades believe that the leadership of Shanghai's literary and artistic work does not attach enough importance to popularization work. In the work of conducting literary and artistic education for workers and cultivating workers' writing ability, there are serious shortcomings that do not proceed from reality. Therefore, although many study classes have been held, the workers have not benefited much and the results are very small. Wang Weishan, Ding He'ying, and others all said: The writing workshops and drama workshops teach too many things and are divorced from reality. The experts invited start from the drum and talk about ballads, clappers, comic dialogues, and work analysis, encompassing everything; when you learn, it is all about climax and low tide, and some experts also teach everyone how to write about love in the play. What does this have to do with the workers' desire to learn how to express labor production? It's completely wrong. Some composers also teach workers to learn to create two-part canons and four-part harmonies, and force music theory into the workers' minds. After the workers listened to climax, low tide, two-part and four-part, they were so scared that even those who had written scripts and songs did not dare to write anymore. Some workers followed the techniques and went astray, and later returned to the original path under the criticism of the masses. Yang Yingchun from Xiexin Woolen Mill said: "The Huxi music creation workshop taught us to write two-part harmonies and two-part harmonies. I can only work overtime at night and use my effort, but the two-part harmony songs I made blindly are not welcomed by the workers. Later, I wrote some short songs based on the factory's production situation, such as writing about woolen workers weaving military blankets to support the volunteers, and the workers became very interested in it. Now I realize that only by relying on the masses and meeting the actual needs of the masses can creation be meaningful."
	When workers write manuscripts and works and send them to writers, the writers often revise them according to their own petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. Wang Weishan mentioned that some songs, after being revised, no longer have the workers' feelings when they are sung. Cheng Yunxiong said: "Writers talk to us about ideology, politics, principles, and policies, many 'ities,' and I can't figure it out. When workers write manuscripts, the writers either say that they don't have this 'ity' or that they don't have that 'ity'; people who are just learning to write are scared by these 'ities,' and they have many concerns when writing, and they don't even dare to write. Some opinions are very empty, and the workers don't understand them."
	Worker comrades also raised opinions about the extravagant and wasteful style of running study classes. They felt that it was too wasteful to eat Western pastries, watch magic tricks, and send commemorative albums at the end of the study class; in addition, everyone was given invitations to play around, wasting a lot of the people's money.
	Worker comrades all said: Study classes should be held, but they should be held better. We must understand the actual needs of the workers, and at the same time, we must use Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic thought to cultivate them, and not poison them with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. Also, it is suggested that the content taught in the study class should not be purely technical, and political education should be paid attention to at the same time.
	Worker comrades have high expectations for this literary and artistic rectification. They hope that literary and art workers can deeply criticize the problems in their own thinking in this rectification, truly establish the thinking of the proletariat, and establish a view of being responsible to the people and serving the working class. Cheng Yunxiong said: "Writers should check more and more today whether their labor achievements are worthy of the people, and should not always think about their past." Worker comrades all said: The workers in our factory welcome literary and art workers to live with us. "I hope that the literary and art circles will recognize their own problems through rectification, and after correcting these problems, they can create better, and can formulate their own creative plans like workers making production plans. We are willing to jointly launch labor competitions in different positions and jointly build our lovely motherland!"
