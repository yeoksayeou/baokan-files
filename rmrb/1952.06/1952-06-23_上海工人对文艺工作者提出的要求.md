Editor's Note: On June 11th and 12th, Shanghai's "Liberation Daily" successively published articles such as "A Worker's Opinion on Literary and Art Workers" and "What Do Shanghai Workers Require of Literary and Art Workers?" The latter is a record of a symposium of active workers in literary and artistic activities in Shanghai. We are reprinting it below (with slight changes to the title and paragraphing). From this, we can see that Shanghai workers are very concerned about the orientation of literary and art work towards workers and the combination of literary and art workers and workers. Their opinions should not only be valued by the literary and art circles in Shanghai, but, just as the report on the Beijing Workers, Peasants and Soldiers Literary and Art Symposium published in this newspaper not long ago, should also be valued by literary and art workers and literary and art organizations in other places. They should be studied and discussed; and in conjunction with the literary and art rectification study, examine their own work and make specific plans to improve their work, so that our literature and art can better serve the workers, peasants and soldiers.

I. The Vigorous Development of Workers' Literary and Artistic Activities in Shanghai
	Over the past three years, the workers' literary and artistic movement in Shanghai has made great progress. Looking at city-wide activities alone, worker drama festivals have been held twice, singing competitions have been held twice, and a sports dance conference has been held once. More than 2,000 people from the Yong'an Cotton Mill participated in the singing competition, and the two drama festivals had more than 100,000 spectators. Workers have rich creative talents. Of the more than 200 drama programs performed, more than half were created by the workers themselves. The themes of the works are all directly taken from political life, labor production, and workers' lives, including: resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, opposing the US arming Japan, production competitions, literacy campaigns, labor insurance, marriage issues, and so on. The forms of expression include opera, drama, skits, Peking opera, Yue opera, singing, comic dialogues, acrobatics... and fifteen other types. In the past three years, the organization of worker literary and art groups has also greatly increased and developed in many ways. When the first Shanghai Literary and Art Workers Congress was held in July 1950, there were only more than 230 cultural work troupes led by the trade union, with more than 16,300 participants; at present, various cultural and entertainment groups (including cultural work troupes, drama troupes, song and dance troupes, orchestras, etc.) have developed to 6,230, with more than 110,000 workers participating. There are more than 800 clubs in the grassroots organizations of various districts and industrial trade unions. These are all concrete manifestations of the urgent demand for literary and artistic activities by Shanghai workers after liberation.
	In these activities, many worker writers have emerged. A worker from Shenxin No. 6 Mill, who originally could not write articles, has now created more than 20 local opera scripts through tireless study. Worker Cheng Yunxiong said: "There is an elderly worker in our factory who is illiterate. He was very happy after liberation. The machines turned quickly, and he sang quickly. One day he sang and sang, and sang a song: 'The Five-Star Red Flag is red and red, China has Mao Zedong, helping peasants to divide the land, and workers have become masters.' Later, this song won an award, and many workers followed him to learn to sing and create." Some workers who originally did not recognize musical notes have now learned to create songs. When many workers in Huxi worked hard to learn to create songs, they put forward the slogan of "learning from the volunteers to shoot down airplanes," and their creative attitude was also very serious. Zhou Xiaoliang from Shanghai Electric Power Company said: "There are many creative talents among the workers. Once, on a small coal-carrying steamship on the Huangpu River, I saw many cartoons drawn by the workers themselves hanging in the office. But these cartoons were not noticed by the experts."
	However, judging from the needs of Shanghai's one million workers and the uneven development of worker literary and artistic activities in various factories, Shanghai's worker literary and artistic work is still far from meeting the actual needs of the workers.

II. Opinions on General Literary and Artistic Works
	The quality of a literary work has a great impact on workers. Jiang Xingchang from the Second Garment Factory said: "When workers saw the volunteers in the 'Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea' films, climbing mountains in the freezing cold, tearing their clothes, and enduring the cold to chase and kill the enemy, everyone was very moved. Therefore, they are not sloppy in making clothes and must make them strong; if they find problems with the ones they made before, they immediately take them back for repairs. Everyone said: 'We must improve product quality, and we will be sorry to the front-line volunteers if we don't do well.'" Cheng Yunxiong from Shenxin No. 6 Mill said: "Workers love to watch 'Boundless Radiance.' The elderly female workers in our factory not only became more active in production after watching it, but also improved their vigilance against special agents. When some people came to the workshop, she would question them." Workers from the Electric Power Company watched this film and repaired generators with great energy. Good works are like this, making workers love to watch them and effectively educating them. However, if the writer has ideological problems or does not work seriously, and the works produced are not good, it will have a very bad effect on the workers and affect their enthusiasm for production. Wang Weishan from Zhicheng Cloth Factory said: "For a period of time, many anti-Afei (In Shanghai before and after liberation, some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois youths were poisoned by the 'culture' of American imperialism, and imitated the non-working, ruffian-like people in some American Western movies in their clothing and lifestyle, called 'Afei' - Editor's note) comic dramas highlighted the greasy and glibness of the Afei, and flaunted many gimmicks. As a result, the stage actually became not anti-Afei, but rather promoting Afei. Afei can no longer be seen on the road, but the Afei on the stage are playing a bad role. A worker in our factory, after watching this kind of play, often imitated the tone of Afei, wearing his hat crookedly, putting his hands on his hips, and making all kinds of strange gestures, which affected the workers' production mood." The workers unanimously protested strongly against this kind of unhealthy content, saying: "We must never tolerate this kind of harmful play!"
	Before attending the symposium, Yang Qishun from Xiangchang Machine Factory solicited opinions from the workers, asking everyone which films depicting workers they liked. The workers said: "Count on your fingers, there are less than ten films depicting workers in the past three years." "The good ones are only 'Boundless Radiance,' 'Singing Triumphant Advance,' and 'Bridge.'" Workers generally feel that there are too few works depicting workers, and even fewer good ones. In terms of novels, the workers said, it is even scarcer. After thinking about it, the workers can only mention Cao Ming's "Original Power," which is a book that workers still relatively like to read. Wang Weishan expressed his opinion on musical creation, saying: "There are not many songs that workers like to listen to. The ones that are often sung are only 'The East is Red,' 'We Workers Have Power,' 'Unity is Strength,' 'Chinese People's Volunteer Army Battle Song,' 'People of the World Unite Tightly,' 'Ode to the Motherland,' 'People of the World are of One Mind,' 'Chinese and Soviet People Unite Tightly'...etc." "There are not many songs that generally match the production movement, and even fewer songs that describe workers' lives. For example, there are many textile workers across the country, and their enthusiasm for production has been very high since liberation, but to this day there is not a single song that sings about their own lives."
	The workers gave their opinions one after another, saying: Writers seem to not see or care about the vigorous struggles and heroic deeds of the workers. Tang Kexin from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 said: "In the three years since liberation, Shanghai workers have gone through the 'February 6th' anti-bombing and anti-blockade struggle in 1950, overcome many difficulties in production; in 1951, they went through major struggles such as the Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea production competition, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and democratic reforms. There are endless stories to tell. But why is there no reflection of this in literary and artistic works? Perhaps writers have difficulties, but very few writers go to the factories. Last year, some writers paid attention to these issues and began to go deep into the factories, but to this day there are still no works." Ji Jinsui from State-owned Cotton Mill No. 10 said: "Some writers in Shanghai are very busy. Sometimes they give reports, saying how to write, how to write, and talk eloquently, but they have never been seen to write articles. Only a little poem is published after the parade, and they are all old clichés such as 'red flags'...etc., which are not energetic to read." The workers eagerly hope to see the new face of the motherland from literary and artistic works, but this also makes them very disappointed. Zhou Xiaoliang said: "Old workers love the motherland and want to see how the motherland is prospering and advancing. They said that it would be good to be able to see the great project of repairing the Huai River in dramas and movies, but until now, their hopes have not been satisfied." The workers all said that the writers cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation, and their labor cannot meet the needs of the masses!
	Some literary and art workers have also written some works reflecting workers' lives, but many of the works are formulas and slogans. Workers speak a lot of theories and dogmas, without emotion. When writing about the transformation of characters, the backward ones are written prominently, and the positive ones are written without strength. Especially the works that are rushed out temporarily, this shortcoming is even more serious. Wang Weishan said: "The songs in the Five-Anti movement, because the writers did not understand the workers' thoughts and feelings, are mostly without emotion, with many slogans and many nouns, such as 'Go up the mountain to fight the tiger, go up the mountain to fight the tiger,' 'Launch a vigorous campaign, launch a vigorous campaign,' who wants to sing it?" Some writers pay attention to the permanent value of their works, so they are not serious or unwilling to write short works that workers like and that match tasks. Zhang Guoxi from Yong'an Cotton Mill said: "We believe that creating works to match the movement is necessary. It doesn't matter if it is not used tomorrow. If your work plays a role today, it has value. But rushing tasks is not a simple matter. If the writers are not familiar with the workers, they will not be able to rush tasks well."
	Some works often distort the image of workers and distort workers' lives. Tang Kexin said: "When writing about the image of workers, the workers always open their mouths wide, laugh hahaha. When they stretch out their fists, they are always rough, and their thoughts and feelings are always vulgar. In fact, our workers are not like this. They have not seen the fine qualities of the working class; especially in the three years since liberation, under the education of the Party and various movements, many workers have greatly improved their class consciousness and political culture. They have endless wisdom and creative ability. There are also many workers who can create. Because the writers have ideological problems, they always see workers as simple and vulgar. They are interested in some of the workers' backward and rude aspects, and think they are 'typical.' How can this not distort the workers?"
	Even some works that are not too bad, the workers feel that they do not write about the heroic spirit of the workers' struggle. Some plays write about the miserable lives of the working people being oppressed by the reactionary rule when they overthrow the reactionary rule, but the resistance and struggle of the working people are not expressed vividly and forcefully. This makes the workers feel uncomfortable: Is our workers' fighting spirit so poor? This is not in line with the facts.
	The workers put forward specific criticisms of works that distort the image of workers and distort reality. Tang Kexin pointed out that "Peace Dove" writes the workers as so stupid, so non-compliant with the system, with a plaster cast on his injured leg, still jumping around in the factory, the author is clearly making fun of the workers. Liu Shuying also raised an opinion on "Peace Dove": "The movie depicts steel workers as thieves. The working class does not have such disorganized and undisciplined people. If someone in our factory is injured at work, the factory director and the Party committee will definitely send someone to visit; but in the movie, there is a worker who secretly goes to the hospital to send a bottle of medicine." Ding He'ying said: "Workers said after watching the workers in the Yue opera 'Human Face and Beast Heart': 'This is not our worker, like a young lady in a high building, so weak.'" Some workers also believe that the workers in the film "Unite to Tomorrow" do not act like workers. Cheng Yunxiong criticized the movie "Unlimited Love": "That kind of petty-bourgeois charity everywhere to the workers and the poor is really an insult to us." Zou Guisheng pointed out the shortcomings of the play "Wedding" compiled by the Yue Opera Editing and Directing Association: "The play writes that the workers owe the landlord rent, which is also an insult. The workers have been living very well after liberation and will not owe rent at all."
	The workers expressed their dissatisfaction with the writers' inability to express the workers well and their distortion of the image of the workers. Tang Kexin earnestly said: "In the future, writers should carefully check why they are interested in those very few backward things, and do not pay attention to the vivid stories and model figures in the factory, and insist on making the workers look ugly?"

III. Opinions on Popular Literary Works and Creative Forms
	Workers are busy with production and like to watch short and popular literary works, such as jingles, clappers, ditties, comic dialogues, short singing words of local operas, short plays, comic strips, etc. However, this aspect has not been valued by general writers. For example, the workers' favorite is comic strips, and Yong'an Cotton Mill has to add hundreds of new ones every month. However, the current comic strips cannot satisfy the workers. There are too few works that take the stories of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and the stories of worker production as themes, and there are phenomena of shoddy work and disguised versions. There are also many comic strips with toxic content. Such as: "Secret History of the Qing Palace," "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian," etc., some are adapted from toxic old films and published with a new name.
	Songs have a great encouraging power for workers' labor production and political struggle. Workers like short and powerful songs. Yang Qishun said: "He had such an experience in the 'Five-Anti' movement. He taught everyone to sing short songs such as 'Where Are You Running, Cunning Merchants' and 'Two Roads for You to Choose,' and the mood was very high. The workers took the initiative to ask: Teach us another song! Everyone learned it, and young and old sang it, spreading the singing everywhere in the workshop and at the conference." However, many musicians always like to write songs for two-part and four-part chorus. Workers have no appetite for these complicated and long songs, and no one sings them, so they do not play a role. Some people also pointed out that the song collections and music books published by the Shanghai branch of the Central Conservatory of Music and professors are all printed with staff notation, and there are very few numbered musical notations. Sometimes workers want to buy one to read, but they cannot understand it. Therefore, it is hoped that composers will understand and meet the actual needs of the masses.
	Literary works are one of the main forms of literature and art, but the popularization work in this area is very poor. Literary and art workers have not attached importance to writing some popular and well-loved things for the workers. The workers said: "Some works are written too deeply now. They are not like the speeches and articles of Chairman Mao and some leaders, with many metaphors, vivid and popular, easy to listen to and easy to understand." Wang Weishan said: "Some works are in Western style, with inverted sentences, which the workers are not used to. Why not use forms that are easy for the Chinese people to understand?" The workers hope to read world literary classics and suggest strengthening and improving the work of rewriting and translating popular editions. Tang Kexin said: "At present, we do not have much of our own creation, and translated works are difficult to read. It is very necessary to rewrite translated works into popular editions. Rewriting should not be procrastinated. The main parts of the work and the current related issues can be written in a storytelling style, which should be systematic and not messy, and easy to read. The popular editions I have read, such as 'How the Steel Was Tempered' and 'Days and Nights,' are relatively good. Shaburov in 'Days and Nights' is very vivid and does not differ much from the original. Doing a good job in rewriting popular editions can play a role in promoting factory literature and art."
	The workers also pointed out that some translated Soviet films are translated in too profound language.

IV. Literary and Artistic Work Should First Serve the Workers
	Many worker comrades put forward opinions from specific literary and artistic work, such as theaters, performances, and service attitudes, believing that Shanghai's literary and artistic work has not taken good care of workers' cultural life. This also shows that literary and art workers lack a clear view of literature and art serving the working class in their thinking.
	Shanghai's factories are mostly concentrated in Pudong and Puxi, which are also where many workers and their families live, while Shanghai's cinemas, theaters and other cultural and entertainment venues are concentrated in the city center, and the worker areas only have a few second- and third-rate small cinemas, small theaters, stage theaters, and open-air theaters. This was originally an extremely unreasonable phenomenon in colonial Shanghai under the rule of imperialism. After liberation, the leading organs of Shanghai's literary and artistic work have paid attention to this point, such as building workers' theaters in Puxi and building "Hengshan Cinema" in Xuhui District. We hope to continue this direction with greater strength in the future. Today, the appearance of cultural and entertainment venues in worker areas has not been given the due change. Lin Chengzhong said: "Some small stage theaters in Pudong perform some yellow and vulgar things. They often perform local operas such as 'Biluo Huangquan,' 'Fan Lihua,' 'Nine Beauties Picture,' 'Lu Yachen,' 'Wu Zetian,' and 'Oil Seller and the Courtesan,' which have not been reformed. They are mostly old content such as 'the fallen son-in-law who became a champion, and the private engagement in the back garden,' and some have committed the mistake of distorting the history of the struggle of the working people." Ding He'ying said: "We watched the film 'White-Haired Girl' and increased our hatred for feudal landlords, but those small theaters are promoting feudal ideology." Some folk arts are called innovative comic duets, but they are full of gimmicks. Lin Chengzhong said: "I hope the leading comrades of literary and artistic work will attach importance to and strengthen the work of transforming them, and help them reform the content of their performances. Don't just pay attention to the few big troupes in the central area." Ding He'ying said: "Although our workers will not follow the characters in these bad plays, we should have good ones to watch."
	Workers are very eager to see some good plays performed in the theaters in the central area. Railway worker Yin Xiquan said: "Workers want to watch 'Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,' but they have to queue up to buy tickets, and the workers simply don't have time. The group tickets with a 20% discount are mostly bought by housewives and neighborhood residents." Cheng Yunxiong said: "Good plays should first meet the workers. But we often have to make a big decision to watch plays. The workers in our factory watched 'In Front of New Things' performed by Lanxin Theater. They couldn't buy tickets and didn't have time to queue up, so they asked people living near the theater to buy them on their behalf. After watching the play, there were no cars late at night, and everyone called a taxi together to return to Pudong." The workers all said that the taxi fare for watching a play cost more than the ticket. As for new movies, the workers only see them when they are shown in the second- and third-rate cinemas in Puxi and Pudong. The workers said: This situation should be changed.
	The workers criticized the state-owned professional troupes for not performing in worker areas. Ye Qingjiang, a cultural and educational cadre of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "There are many state-owned troupes in Shanghai, but they rarely go to the districts and factories to perform. Some troupes are reluctant to leave the Lanxin Theater, but Lanxin only has more than 700 seats, while Shanghai has more than one million workers. Pudong and Puxi both have workers' clubs and venues. Sometimes the trade unions invite them to perform, but they are not very willing to go. They have not truly recognized that their main service objects are the workers, and they only like the beautiful venue of Lanxin."
	Many factory workers believe that the China Film Management Company, East China Branch, does not have enough spirit of serving the workers. The workers often cannot rent the films they hope to see, and the company is sometimes just perfunctory and does not work seriously. Zou Guisheng said: "Once I rented a film whose content could match the conference held in the factory, but it was agreed upon, but it was not given temporarily. The company gave us some confused and unclear old films."

V. Literary and Art Workers Should Combine with the Worker Masses
	The workers said that in the past few years, many literary and art workers have come to the factory to experience life and have gained some gains in ideological transformation and creation, and the workers have also received a lot of help; however, some literary and art workers have not gained anything. Some of them forgot that they were going to transform their thinking, but came to the factory specifically to collect materials and engage in their own creation; some came to the factory as cultural guests with the idea that "I am a writer, I am here to experience life"; some came as literary and artistic mentors; and some were only assigned by the organization and did not want to come to the factory on their own initiative.
	If literary and art workers do not first take down their airs after entering the factory, and always regard themselves as leaders, how can they talk about transformation? Zhang Guoxi said: "Some literary and art workers still put on the airs of guiding others: 'I can sing, I can do plays, you call some people, and I will help you rehearse the plays.'" Cheng Yunxiong said: "I hope that literary and art workers do not see the backwardness of individual workers and think that there is nothing to learn, and say that the working class cannot be the leading class. In fact, the class nature of the workers is very clear. For example, in the 'Five-Anti' movement, when fighting with the bosses, the workers showed a high degree of fighting enthusiasm and a firm class stand. But some literary and art workers still 'respectfully' smiled and could not bring themselves to speak out at the struggle occasions when they met the bosses. You see, isn't the difference in class stand very obvious?"
	Similarly, if writers do not recognize the significance of going to the factory to transform their thinking from the ideological level, and strive to establish the view of wholeheartedly serving the working class, even if they go to the place where the masses are struggling, they will not change their lifestyle, go deep into the struggle of the masses, and integrate with the thoughts and feelings of the masses. The workers enthusiastically put forward many criticisms and suggestions in this regard. Ye Qingjiang said: "Last year, a literary and art worker was experiencing life in the factory. He did not go to the workshop, but went to the office every day, with a cup of tea and a book, chatting with senior staff. After work, he went to the homes of senior staff to play, and he had a very good relationship with senior staff. On factory rest days, others went to visit the families of workers, but he went home or slipped away to Suzhou to play." Yu Jiancheng from Shenxin No. 9 Mill said: "In 1950, a writer came to our factory to experience life. He came for more than a month, and the workers asked strangely when they saw him: Who is this person? Someone answered that he was a young writer. The workers wanted to talk to him, but they couldn't find him anywhere." Some literary and art workers have to wait for others to introduce them before meeting the workers, and do not take the initiative to warmly care about the workers' labor and life, and care about the big and small things that happen among the workers. They still stick to the "kingdom" of intellectuals in their thoughts and feelings, and therefore, always interact with the workers with the tone of intellectuals. Cheng Yunxiong said: "When writers and reporters come to the factory, they always start with 'starting from ideological viewpoints,' 'raising to the height of principles,' and what 'purpose and requirements' to achieve, and the workers don't want to listen to it." These incorrect attitudes of the writers directly hinder their combination with the worker masses. "When workers sing their own songs in labor, they don't sing when the writer comes." Wang Weishan said: "When writers go to the factory, they should truly integrate with the masses. It's not simply that I teach you culture, and you give me life, this kind of deal. Writers should live completely among the workers, and cannot engage in guerrilla warfare, otherwise they cannot become confidants with each other. When writers are with workers, don't be afraid to expose your thoughts and shortcomings, just expose them boldly, so that everyone can help you, and you can make up your mind to dig to the root and constantly transform yourself."
	The workers also asked the writers who came to the factory to give them some practical help in their literary and artistic life. Like some literary and art workers in the past who came to the factory, they only cared about locking themselves in the office to write a few scenes of the script. They smoked a pack of cigarettes, and when the workers asked them to read what they wrote, they only said: Good! Good! In fact, they didn't even look at it. When asked to help rehearse the play, they also said: "No, we want to learn from you." and turned it down. Some writers are subjectively enthusiastic about helping others, but when they talk about it, they talk about clothing, actors' waists, and a set of theories, which is of no help to the workers.

VI. Opinions on Worker Literary and Art Guidance Work and Leadership Work
	Worker comrades believe that the leadership of Shanghai's literary and artistic work does not attach enough importance to popularization work. In the work of conducting literary and artistic education for workers and cultivating workers' writing ability, there are serious shortcomings that do not proceed from reality. Therefore, although many study classes have been held, the workers have not benefited much and the results are very small. Wang Weishan, Ding He'ying, and others all said: The writing workshops and drama workshops teach too many things and are divorced from reality. The experts invited start from the drum and talk about ballads, clappers, comic dialogues, and work analysis, encompassing everything; when you learn, it is all about climax and low tide, and some experts also teach everyone how to write about love in the play. What does this have to do with the workers' desire to learn how to express labor production? It's completely wrong. Some composers also teach workers to learn to create two-part canons and four-part harmonies, and force music theory into the workers' minds. After the workers listened to climax, low tide, two-part and four-part, they were so scared that even those who had written scripts and songs did not dare to write anymore. Some workers followed the techniques and went astray, and later returned to the original path under the criticism of the masses. Yang Yingchun from Xiexin Woolen Mill said: "The Huxi music creation workshop taught us to write two-part harmonies and two-part harmonies. I can only work overtime at night and use my effort, but the two-part harmony songs I made blindly are not welcomed by the workers. Later, I wrote some short songs based on the factory's production situation, such as writing about woolen workers weaving military blankets to support the volunteers, and the workers became very interested in it. Now I realize that only by relying on the masses and meeting the actual needs of the masses can creation be meaningful."
	When workers write manuscripts and works and send them to writers, the writers often revise them according to their own petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings. Wang Weishan mentioned that some songs, after being revised, no longer have the workers' feelings when they are sung. Cheng Yunxiong said: "Writers talk to us about ideology, politics, principles, and policies, many 'ities,' and I can't figure it out. When workers write manuscripts, the writers either say that they don't have this 'ity' or that they don't have that 'ity'; people who are just learning to write are scared by these 'ities,' and they have many concerns when writing, and they don't even dare to write. Some opinions are very empty, and the workers don't understand them."
	Worker comrades also raised opinions about the extravagant and wasteful style of running study classes. They felt that it was too wasteful to eat Western pastries, watch magic tricks, and send commemorative albums at the end of the study class; in addition, everyone was given invitations to play around, wasting a lot of the people's money.
	Worker comrades all said: Study classes should be held, but they should be held better. We must understand the actual needs of the workers, and at the same time, we must use Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic thought to cultivate them, and not poison them with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. Also, it is suggested that the content taught in the study class should not be purely technical, and political education should be paid attention to at the same time.
	Worker comrades have high expectations for this literary and artistic rectification. They hope that literary and art workers can deeply criticize the problems in their own thinking in this rectification, truly establish the thinking of the proletariat, and establish a view of being responsible to the people and serving the working class. Cheng Yunxiong said: "Writers should check more and more today whether their labor achievements are worthy of the people, and should not always think about their past." Worker comrades all said: The workers in our factory welcome literary and art workers to live with us. "I hope that the literary and art circles will recognize their own problems through rectification, and after correcting these problems, they can create better, and can formulate their own creative plans like workers making production plans. We are willing to jointly launch labor competitions in different positions and jointly build our lovely motherland!"

### 上海工人对文艺工作者提出的要求

专栏：

    上海工人对文艺工作者提出的要求
    编者按：六月十一日、十二日，上海“解放日报”先后发表了“一个工人对文艺工作者的意见”和“上海工人对文艺工作者要求些什么？”等文。后者是上海市工人文艺活动积极分子的文艺座谈会的纪录，现转载在下面（标题及分段稍有更动）。从这里，我们可以看到上海工人对于文艺工作面向工人以及文艺工作者和工人结合的问题，是十分关心的。他们的意见不仅应该引起上海文艺界的重视，正如不久以前本报所发表的北京工农兵文艺座谈会的报道一样，同样也应该受到其他各地的文艺工作者和文艺机关团体的重视。他们应该加以研究和讨论；并结合文艺整风学习，检查自己的工作，作出具体的改进工作的计划，使我们的文艺更好地为工农兵服务。一、上海工人文艺活动蓬勃发展
    三年来，上海工人文艺运动有很大的进展。单就全市性的活动来看，工人戏剧观摩演出举行过两次，歌咏竞赛也举行过两次，体育舞蹈大会举行过
    一次。永安纱厂曾经有二千多人参加歌咏竞赛，两次戏剧观摩演出的观众有十万多。工人们有着丰富的创作才能，在演出的二百多个戏剧节目中，工人自己创作的占一半以上。创作的主题都是直接取自政治生活、劳动生产与工人生活的，包括：抗美援朝、镇压反革命、反对美国武装日本、生产竞赛、识字运动、劳动保险、婚姻问题等等。表现的形式有歌剧、话剧、活报、京剧、越剧、歌咏、相声、杂耍……等十五种。三年来，工人文艺团体组织也有很大的增加和多方面的发展。一九五○年七月开上海第一次文艺工作者代表大会的时候，工会领导的文工团只有二百三十多个，参加人数只有一万六千三百多人；目前各种文娱团体（包括文工团、剧团、歌舞团、乐队等）已发展到六千二百三十个，参加的工人达十一万以上。各区和各产业工会基层组织的俱乐部有八百多所。这些都是上海工人在解放后迫切要求文艺活动的具体表现。
    在这些活动中，出现了不少工人作家。申新六厂有位工人，原来不会写文章，但是经过不倦的学习，现在单是某些地方戏的剧本已创作了二十几本。工人成云雄说：“我们厂里有位不识字的老年工人，解放后心里很愉快，机器转动得快，他唱得快。有一天他唱呀唱，唱出了一个歌：‘五星红旗红又红，中国出了毛泽东，帮助农民分了田，工人做了主人翁。’后来这个歌得了奖，很多工人也就跟着他学唱学创作。”有的工人原来连歌谱的音符都不认识，现在已学会创作歌子。沪西不少工人努力学习创作歌曲时，提出“学习志愿军打飞机”的口号，他们的创作态度也很严肃认真。上海电力公司周效良说：“工人中创作人才不少，有一次在黄浦江的运煤的小火轮上，看到办公室里挂了很多工人自己画的漫画。但是这些漫画，专家们都没有去注意。”
    但是，从上海一百万工人的需要和工人文艺活动在各厂开展的不平衡情况看来，上海的工人文艺工作还是很不能满足工人的实际要求的。
    二、对一般文艺作品的意见
    一部文艺作品的好坏对工人有很大的影响。被服二厂蒋兴昌说：“工人看到‘抗美援朝’影片里的志愿军，在冰天雪地里，爬山弄破衣服，露出了棉花，还忍着寒冷追杀敌人，大家很受感动。因此做衣服一点不马虎，要做得牢牢的；从前做的，发现毛病，马上拿回来修补。大家都说：‘要提高产品质量，做不好就对不起前线志愿军。’”申新六厂成云雄说：“工人爱看‘光芒万丈’，我们厂里年老的女工看了，不仅生产积极，防备特务的警惕性也提高了，有些人到车间里来，她就要去查问。”电力公司工人看了这部影片，修发电机时修得很有劲。好作品就是这样叫工人看了喜爱，并有力地教育着工人。可是，如果作家思想上有毛病或者工作不认真，搞出的作品不好，就会在工人中发生很坏作用，影响工人的生产积极性。志成布厂王渭山说：“有一个时期，不少反阿飞（上海解放前后一个时期内，曾经有一些资产阶级和小资产阶级青年，受了美帝国主义‘文化’的毒害，在服装和生活上都模仿某些美国电影所表现的美国西部那些不务正业、有流氓习气的人，叫做‘阿飞’——编者注）的滑稽戏，把阿飞的油腔滑调写得很突出，卖弄很多噱头，结果台上实际上变成不是反阿飞，反而是宣扬阿飞了。马路上阿飞已经看不到了，舞台上的阿飞却在起着坏作用。我们厂里有一个工人，看了这种戏后，就时常学起阿飞的腔调，帽子歪戴，手向腰间一叉，做出种种怪模怪样来，影响了工人们的生产情绪。”工人们一致对这种内容不健康的作品，提出严厉的抗议，他们说：“我们对这种有害的戏绝不能容忍！”
    祥昌机器厂杨期顺参加座谈会之前，向工人们征求意见，问大家喜爱那些表现工人的电影时，工人说：“手指头扳扳看，三年来描写工人的电影不到十部。”“好的，数来数去也只有‘光芒万丈’、
    ‘高歌猛进’、‘桥’这几部。”工人普遍感到描写工人的作品太少，好的更少。在小说方面，工人们说，这更是少得可怜了，工人们想来想去，只能提到草明的“原动力”，这是工人还比较爱看的一本书。王渭山对音乐创作发表意见，他说：“能叫工人喜欢的歌也不多，常常唱的只有‘东方红’、‘我们工人有力量’、‘团结就是力量’、‘中国人民志愿军战歌’、‘全世界人民团结紧’、‘歌唱祖国’、‘全世界人民心一条’、‘中苏人民团结紧’……等。”“一般配合生产运动的歌子不多，描写工人生活的歌子更少。例如全国有很多的纺织工人，解放后生产情绪都很高，但是到今天还没有一个歌唱他们自己生活的歌子。”
    工人们纷纷提意见说：作家们似乎看不到或不关心工人群众中轰轰烈烈的斗争和英雄的事迹。国棉六厂唐克新说：“解放到现在三年，上海工人经过一九五○年的‘二六’反轰炸和反封锁斗争，克服了生产上许多困难；一九五一年又经过抗美援朝生产竞赛，镇压反革命，民主改革等大的斗争，生动的事迹说不完。但是为什么在文艺作品里没有反映呢？或许作家有困难，但是作家下厂的很少。去年，有些作家已注意这些问题，开始深入工厂，可是，到现在仍没有作品。”国棉十厂季金燧说：“上海有的作家很忙，有时做报告，说怎样写怎样写，讲得头头是道，但始终没有见过他们写的文章，只有在游行后登出一点诗来，也都是‘红旗啦……’等等老一套，看了没有劲道。”工人们热切地渴望从文艺作品里看到祖国的新面貌，但是这一点也使他们很失望。周效良说：“老工人热爱祖国，要看一看祖国怎样在兴旺前进，他们说要能在戏里、电影里看到修治淮河的伟大工程就好了，但直到现在，仍然没有满足他们的希望。”工人们都说作家跟不上客观形势的发展，他们的劳动太不能满群众的意了！
    有些文艺工作者也写了些反映工人生活的作品，但不少的作品是公式和口号，工人嘴里讲出一大套的理论和教条，没有感情。写人物的转变，落后的写得突出，正面的就写得没有力量。尤其是临时赶起来的作品，这种缺点更严重。王渭山说：“五反中的歌，因为作家没有体会工人的思想情感，大多是没有感情的，口号多，名词多，如‘上山打虎，上山打虎’，‘大张旗鼓，大张旗鼓’，有谁要唱呢？”有的作家讲究作品的永久性价值，就不认真或者不愿意写工人喜欢的短小的和配合任务的作品。永安纱厂张国熙说：“我们认为，创作配合运动是需要的，明天不用就不用，今天你的作品起了作用，就有价值。但是赶任务也不是简单的事，作家对工人不熟悉，赶任务也赶不好的。”
    有些作品常常歪曲了工人的形象，歪曲工人的生活。唐克新说：“写工人形象，都是工人嘴一张老大，笑起来哈哈哈。拳头伸出来总是粗里粗气，思想感情也总低俗不堪。其实我们工人并不是这样的。他们就没有看到工人阶级的优良品质；特别是解放三年来，在党的教育和各种运动的教育底下，许多工人同志阶级觉悟和政治文化都有很大提高，他们有无穷无尽的智慧和创造能力。工人中间能创作的也很多。因为作家思想上有问题，总把工人看为简单的，粗俗的。他们看到工人的某些落后、粗鲁的地方，就感到兴趣，就以为是‘典型’了，这样那能不歪曲工人呢？”
    即使有些并不算太坏的作品，工人们也觉得并没有写出工人的英勇斗争的精神，甚至有的戏写劳动人民推翻反动统治的时候，把反动统治压迫劳动人民的悲惨生活写得很重，而对劳动人民的反抗和斗争却表现得并不生动有力。这叫工人看了不舒服：难道我们工人的斗争性是这样差的吗？这是不符合事实的。
    工人们对歪曲工人形象的和歪曲现实的作品提出了具体的批评。唐克新指出“和平鸽”里面把工人写得那样愚蠢，那样不遵守制度，受伤的腿上了石膏，还到工厂蹦蹦跳跳，作者明明是在出工人的洋相。刘淑英对“和平鸽”也提出意见：“电影里把钢铁工人描写成小偷。工人阶级没有这样无组织无纪律的人。我们厂里有人因工作受伤，厂长、党委一定派人去访问；但电影中，却有工人偷偷到医院去送一瓶药的事情。”丁荷英说：“工人看越剧‘人面兽心’里的工人后说：“这不是我们工人，像是高楼上小姐，这样软弱。”也有工人认为影片“团结起来到明天”里几个工人演得不像。成云雄对电影“无限的爱”批评说：“那种小资产阶级处处对工人穷人们施舍的情形，对我们实在是一种侮辱。”邹癸生指出越剧编导联谊会编的“婚事”一剧的缺点说：“戏里面写工人欠房东房钱，这也是侮辱，解放后工人生活过得蛮好，根本不会欠。”
    工人们对作家不能很好地表现工人，歪曲了工人形象，表示很不满意，唐克新恳切地说：“今后作家应该好好检查，为什么对那些极少的落后的东西有兴趣，对工厂里的生动事迹、模范人物不注意，硬要叫工人出丑呢？”
    三、对通俗文艺作品和创作形式的意见
    工人生产忙，都喜欢看短小通俗的文艺作品，如顺口溜、快板、小调、相声、地方戏的短唱词、短剧、连环画等。可是，这方面没有得到一般作家的重视。譬如工人最爱看的是连环画，永安纱厂每月就要添置几百本新的。但是现在所出的连环画并不能使工人们满意。把抗美援朝的故事和工人生产的故事作为题材的作品太少，同时存在着粗制滥造和改头换面的现象，还有很多连环画的内容是有毒素的。如：“清宫秘史”、“武松与潘金莲”等，有的是根据有毒素的旧影片改编后加上一个新名目出版的。
    歌曲对工人们的劳动生产和政治斗争的鼓舞力量很大，工人欢喜短小有力的歌曲，杨期顺说：“他自己在‘五反’运动中就有这样的体会，教大家唱短小歌曲如‘奸商你往那里逃’、‘两条道路由你挑’等，情绪很高，工人主动要求：再教我们唱一只歌吧！大家学会了，年纪小的老的都唱，车间里、大会上到处传播着歌声。”但是有很多音乐家老喜欢写二部四部合唱的歌，对这些复杂的和长的歌曲，工人是没有胃口的，没人唱，因此也就不起作用。还有人提出，中央音乐学院上海分院和教授出的一些歌集和音乐书都是印的五线谱，很少有简谱。工人有时要买一本看看，就没法看懂。所以希望作曲家了解和满足群众的实际需要。
    文学作品是文艺主要形式之一，但是在这方面的普及工作做得很差，文艺工作者没有重视为工人写些通俗的喜闻乐见的东西。工人说：“现在有些作品写得太深了，不像毛主席和有些首长的讲话文章，比喻多，生动通俗，听也听得懂，看也看得懂。”王渭山说：“有些作品是西洋体裁，倒装句，工人看不惯。为什么不用中国人民容易懂的形式来写呢？”工人们希望看世界文学名著，建议加强和改进改写翻译通俗本的工作。唐克新说：“目前我们自己的创作不多，翻译作品看起来吃力，把翻译作品改写成通俗本是很需要的。改写不要拖拖拉拉，可以把作品的主要部分和目前有关的问题，用讲故事体裁写出来，要有系统，勿拉杂，看起来容易。我看过的通俗本如‘钢铁是怎样炼成的’、‘日日夜夜’等，都比较好。‘日日夜夜’里的沙布洛夫就很生动，和原作没有什么出入。改写通俗本工作做得好，对工厂文艺可以起推动作用。”
    工人们还提出有些翻译的苏联影片，言语翻译得太深奥。
    四、文艺工作应该首先面向工人
    很多工人同志从具体的文艺工作如剧场、演出、服务态度等问题提出意见，认为上海文艺工作没有很好地关心工人文化生活。从这里也表现了文艺工作者在思想上缺乏明确的文艺为工人阶级服务的观点。
    上海的工厂大都集中于沪东和沪西，这两个地区也是很多工人和工人家属居住的地方，而上海的电影院、戏院等文化娱乐场所则集中于市中心地区，工人地区只有少数的二、三轮小影院、小戏馆、戏棚子和露天剧场。这原是从前帝国主义统治下的殖民地上海的极不合理的现象。解放后，上海文艺工作领导机关已注意到这一点，如在沪西建立工人剧场，徐汇区建造“衡山电影院”等，我们希望今后用更大的力量来坚持这个方向。在今天来看，工人地区的文化娱乐场所的面貌，还没有得到应有的改观。林成忠说：“沪东的一些小戏棚子演的都是一些黄色下流的东西。经常演的是‘碧落黄泉’、‘樊梨花’、‘九美图’、‘陆雅臣’、‘武则天’、‘花魁卖油郎’等没有经过改革的地方戏。它们大都是‘落难公子中状元，后花园私订终身’一类的旧内容，还有的犯了歪曲历史上劳动人民的斗争的错误。”丁荷英说：“我们看了‘白毛女’影片，对封建地主增加了仇恨，但那些小戏馆却在宣传封建思想。”有些曲艺号称革新双簧，却滥放噱头。林成忠说：“希望文艺工作的领导同志重视和加强改造他们的工作，帮助他们改革演出内容。不要光注意中心区的几个大剧团。”丁荷英说：“虽然我们工人不会跟着这些坏戏里面的人物走，但是应该有好的给我们看。”
    工人很希望看到在中心区戏院里演出的一些好戏。铁路工人殷锡泉说：“工人想看‘梁山伯与祝英台’，但是买票要排队，工人根本没有时间，打八折的团体票，也多是家庭妇女、里弄居民买的。”成云雄说：“好戏应该首先和工人见面。但是我们看戏常常要下很大决心，我们厂里工人看兰心戏院演的‘在新事物的面前’，买不到票，又没有时间排队，就托了住在戏院附近的人代买的。看完戏，深夜没有车子，大家合叫小汽车回沪东。”工人们都说看一场戏车钱比戏票花的多。至于新的电影，也是轮到沪西沪东二、三轮影院上映时，工人才看到。工人们说：应该改变这种情况。
    对公营的专业剧团不到工人地区去演戏，工人们都提出批评。市总工会文教干部叶清江说：“上海有不少公营剧团，却不大下区下厂演出。有的剧团留恋兰心戏院的场子，可是兰心只有七百多个座位，而上海却有一百多万工人。沪东沪西都有工人俱乐部和场子，工会有时请他们去演，他们都不大愿意去。他们没有真正认识到自己的主要服务对象是工人，只欢喜兰心的漂亮的场子。”
    好些工厂的工人同志认为，中国影片经理公司华东区公司为工人服务的精神很不够，工人们常常租不到希望看到的影片，该公司有时只是应付，工作不认真。邹葵生说：“有一次租一部影片，内容可以配合厂里开的大会，可是，说好了，临时又不给。公司都给我们一些糊涂、听不清楚的老片子。”
    五、文艺工作者应该与工人群众结合
    工人们说，几年中，有不少文艺工作者下厂来体验生活，在思想改造和创作方面都有了一些收获，工人也得到很多帮助；但是，也有一些文艺工作者却没有什么收获。他们中间有的忘记了自己要进行改造思想，却是为着专门收集材料和自己搞创作才下厂的；有的带着“我是作家，是下厂来体验生活的”思想来作文化客人的；有的是做文艺导师来的；还有的只是因为组织上分配，不是主动要下厂的。
    文艺工作者下厂以后，不先拿下架子，处处以领导者自居，还谈得上什么改造呢？张国熙说：“有的文艺工作者还摆着指导别人的架子：‘我会唱歌，会搞戏，你们召些人来，我帮你们排戏。’”成云雄说：“希望文艺工作者不要看到个别工人落后，就觉得没有什么好学，说工人阶级不能做领导阶级。其实工人的阶级性是很明确的，比方说在‘五反’当中，和老板进行斗争时，工人就表现了高度的斗争热情和坚定的阶级立场。但有的文艺工作者在斗争的场合见了老板，还是‘客客气气’笑嘻嘻的拉不下脸来。你看，阶级立场的不同，不是很明显么？”
    同样的，作家没有从思想上认清下厂改造思想的意义，努力建立全心全意为工人阶级服务的观点，即使到了群众斗争生活的场所，也是不会改变自己的生活态度，深入群众斗争生活中去，和群众的思想感情打成一片的。工人们热情地在这方面提出很多批评和建议。叶清江说：“去年有一位文艺工作者在厂里体验生活，不下车间，每天上办公室，茶一杯，书一本，和高级职员谈天。下班后，就去高级职员家里玩，他和高级职员联系得很好。厂休息日别人去访问工人家属，他却回家，或者溜到苏州去玩了。”申新九厂虞建程说：“一九五○年有位作家到我们厂里来体验生活，来了一个多月，工人看见他都奇怪地问：这是什么人？有人回答说是青年作家。工人想找他谈谈，却到处找也找不到他。”有的文艺工作者要等人家替他介绍，才与工人见面的，不是主动地热情地关心工人的劳动和生活，关心工人中间发生的大小事情，在思想感情上还固守着知识分子“王国”，因此，总是带着知识分子腔调和工人们交往。成云雄说：“作家和记者到厂里来，一开口就是什么‘思想观点出发’，‘提到原则高度’，又是达到什么‘目的要求’，工人听都不愿听。”作家的这一些不正确的态度直接妨害自己和工人群众结合。“工人在劳动中唱着自己做的歌，作家一去就不唱了。”王渭山说：“作家下厂，应该真正和群众打成一片。不是简单地我教你文化，你给我生活的这套买卖。作家要完全生活在工人中间，不能打游击似的，否则就不能彼此间结成知心朋友。作家和工人在一起时，不要怕暴露自己的思想和缺点，大胆暴露好了，这样，大家就可以帮助你，你也能痛下决心挖根，不断改造自己。”
    工人们也要求下厂的作家对他们的文艺生活多给些实际帮助。像过去有的文艺工作者下厂，只管自己关在办公室里写几幕头的剧本。香烟吸了一盒，工人写的东西请他看，只说：好！好！其实，看也不看。请他们帮助排戏，也说：“不行，我们要向你们学习。”就推掉了。有些作家主观上是想热心帮助人家的，但讲起来就是讲究服装、演员腰身等一套理论，这样对工人就没有什么帮助。
    六、对工人文艺辅导工作与领导工作的意见
    工人同志认为，上海的文艺工作领导上对普及工作的重视是不够的。在对工人进行文艺教育、培养工人写作能力的工作上，存在不从实际出发的严重缺点。因此，虽然办了很多学习班，但工人得益不多，收效也很小。王渭山、丁荷英等都说：写作讲习班、戏剧学习班，学的东西太多，脱离实际。请来的专家从大鼓讲起讲到弹词、快板、相声和作品分析，包罗万象；一学起来就是什么高潮、低潮，有的专家还教大家在戏里怎样写谈恋爱等。这和工人希望学习怎样表现劳动生产的要求有什么关系呢？完全不对头了。还有的作曲家教工人学习创作二部轮唱四部合唱，把乐理硬向工人脑子里装。工人听了高潮低潮、二部四部以后，原来写过剧本和歌子的也吓得不敢写了。有的工人跟着钻技巧，就走了弯路，后来在群众的批评下才又摸对了原路。协新毛纺厂杨迎春说：“沪西音乐创作学习班教我们写二部合唱二部和声，我只能夜里开夜车，用功夫，但是瞎摸中作出来二部合唱的歌曲，工人不欢迎。后来我针对厂里的生产情况，写些短歌曲，如写毛纺工人织军毯支援志愿军等，工人就对它很有兴趣。现在我认识到只有依靠群众，满足群众实际需要，创作才有意思。”
    工人写了稿子和作品送给作家看，作家往往根据自己的小资产阶级的思想感情来批改。王渭山就提到有些歌被改后，唱起来就没有工人感情。成云雄说：“作家对我们讲究思想性、政治性、原则性、政策性，很多‘性’，我钻也钻不出名堂。有的工人写的稿子，作家们不是说没有这个‘性’，就是说没有那个‘性’；初学写稿的人，被这些‘性’吓住了，写作时顾虑很多，甚至不敢写了。有些意见很空洞，工人不懂。”
    工人同志对办学习班时铺张浪费的作风也提了意见。他们觉得学习班结束时吃西点，看魔术，发纪念册太浪费；另外又给大家发帖子玩一通，浪费了人民不少的钱。
    工人同志都说：学习班是要办的，但是要办得好点。要了解工人的实际需要，同时必须用马克思列宁主义文艺思想来培养他们，不要用资产阶级小资产阶级的思想来使他们受到毒害。还有，建议学习班教的内容不应该是纯技术的，应同时注意政治教育。
    工人同志对这次文艺界整风寄与很大的期望。他们希望文艺工作者在这次整风中，能够深刻地批判自己思想上的毛病，真正建立起无产阶级的思想，确立对人民群众负责、为工人阶级服务的观点。成云雄说：“作家应该多检查检查今天他们的劳动成果，到底对得起人民不，不要老是想自己的过去。”工人同志都说：我们厂里工人很欢迎文艺工作者来和我们一起生活。“希望文艺界通过整风，认清自己的毛病，改掉这些毛病以后，更好地创作，能像工人订生产计划一样订出自己的创作计划。我们愿意在不同的岗位上，共同展开劳动竞赛，共同来建设我们可爱的祖国！”
