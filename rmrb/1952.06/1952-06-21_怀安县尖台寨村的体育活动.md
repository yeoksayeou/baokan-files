    Sports Activities in Jiantai Village, Huaian County
    Huang Zuohui
    Jiantai Village is located in Huaian County, in the central part of Chahar Province. The sparkling Dayang River flows from the north, and the sound of trains speeding across the plains can be heard from ten miles away. The early summer sunset shines on the golden walls of Jiantai Village, and neatly arranged houses interspersed with lush green poplar trees can be seen from afar. The farmers are busy completing their bumper harvest plans, and the boundless fields are filled with the joy of labor. Not a single idler can be seen on the village's main roads and paths. Cheerful songs of children can be heard from the elementary school. It was on this evening that we arrived at this village.
    Three years ago, Jiantai Village was still an impoverished village. Landlords controlled more than 1,800 mu of the 2,100 mu of farmland. Farmers toiled all year round, yet they could not get enough to eat or wear. Except for the landlords and rich peasants, only four or five of the village's more than 480 people were literate. In 1949, the peasants took back the land from the landlords. In the past three years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they organized mutual aid production teams. Everyone used enthusiastic labor to create a prosperous life. Each household has enough grain, and each person can wear two or three new sets of clothes each year. More than 80 peasant children have entered elementary school, and 70 peasants have attended literacy classes. Thirty-two people can read newspapers. Although the drought was severe last year, they did not need relief grain from the People's Government. Some difficult households could solve their problems with mutual help from everyone. The days of worrying about food and clothing are long gone.
    This year, Jiantai Village is one of the bumper harvest villages in the entire district. The bumper harvest households plan to increase the yield per unit area from 400 jin to 850 jin. Mutual aid production teams and newspaper reading groups have been universally organized. They have achieved excellent results in drought resistance, pest control, donations for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, militia training, and youth recreational activities. There are 34 Party members and 16 Youth League members in the village.
    Under these favorable conditions, the sports activities in Jiantai Village have been well developed.
    The Party branch secretary and the village chief first led us to visit the sports field. This sports field is a flat open space of about two mu, located in front of the elementary school in the center of the village. A row of small poplar trees is planted next to the sports field, and the small slopes on the south and west sides have become natural grandstands. The three sand pits for high jump, long jump, and pommel horse are located in the northeast and southeast of the field, respectively. A thick, long rope hangs on the tall trees in the north. There are also sports equipment such as parallel bars, tug-of-war, jump ropes, hand grenades, and soccer balls. There are so many sports equipment in this village.
    This evening, like in the past, everyone finished a day's work. Shortly after dinner, some people began to walk towards the playground. The loudspeaker at the high point in the center of the village emitted a loud and attractive sound: "Young comrades! It's time for sports activities, please go to the playground quickly!..." A group of young people quickly gathered on the playground. Villagers and children also came to the playground. At about 7:30, the activities started with militia training. After about 20 minutes of drills, everyone did broadcast gymnastics together. The militia captain gave the commands, and everyone did it very neatly and forcefully. Then there were group activities. Those on the east side were spinning non-stop on the parallel bars; those on the southeast side were flying over the high jump; those practicing the long jump were carefully correcting their postures; a row of people on the north side were jumping over the pommel horse one after another; those practicing rope climbing had already climbed to the two-zhang-high trees; the tug-of-war competition was in a deadlock. Inside the field, some were playing games, some were jumping rope, and some were playing soccer. When encountering difficulties in practice, they would ask the elementary school teachers and a returned soldier in the village for guidance. Elementary school teacher Kang Jin is in charge of physical education; returned soldier Jin Wanfu was a skills team member in the People's Liberation Army before his demobilization. They are very willing to guide the young people in sports, often telling them how to jump, how to run... After the group practice, there was individual activity. Whoever wanted to practice whatever they wanted, they practiced what they wanted. The children also came to long jump and jump rope. An old man even personally took to the field to help a team of children who were about to lose to overcome their tug-of-war rivals. Soccer was even more lively. Adults, children, and young people all scrambled for the ball and kicked the ball high. The playground was crowded with people, they were running, jumping.... They didn't go to literacy class until it was dark.
    Now, although it is the busy farming season, everyone is using all their strength to strive to achieve this year's bumper harvest plan. There is not enough time to carry out collective activities every day, so it has been changed to once every three to five days. Under the principle of not hindering production, the young people's interest in sports activities has not diminished in the slightest. More than a dozen sports activists have not stopped their activities from the beginning to the present. The number of people who automatically come here to practice every morning and evening has not decreased. As soon as the sky dawns, some people are here to practice running, parallel bars, and gymnastics. Some people come here to fetch water, and they will only leave after doing a couple of parallel bars. Every morning, the mutual aid production teams also gather here. The team members who arrive first seize the time to practice. When everyone is present, they go to the fields to work together. This place has become the activity center of the masses in Jiantai Village.
    Not long ago, they held a competition, and there has been an improvement in sports performance. Cui Guocheng's high jump result was 1.40 meters, Cui Jianming threw the hand grenade 44 meters away, and rope climbing can generally reach 6 meters high. Young people and young women aged 18 to 35 have all learned broadcast gymnastics. When revising the patriotic pact, they added a clause "Strengthen militia training, strengthen sports activities."
    The enthusiastic sports activities have been going on in this village for eight months. How did it start? After the autumn harvest in October last year, the Youth League Huaian County Committee, in order to implement the spirit of the North China Military Sports Work Conference, decided to cultivate two key villages. Military Sports Committee member Xu Shiyuan believed that his original village - Jiantai Village - had some foundation in Party and League work, and the young people were very active, so it was possible to make it a key village. The Party and Youth League County Committee agreed with this opinion, so he returned to his village to carry out work. Previously, he was the secretary of the Youth League branch in the village, and he was promoted to the county as a military sports committee member because of his achievements in leading recreational activities and League work. He has a high prestige among the young people in the village. This time he returned, he was welcomed by the young people. His work was first valued and helped by the Party, Youth League, and administrative leaders, and then he mobilized at the League member congress and literacy classes, publicizing the significance of sports activities for physical health, production, and national defense. Elementary school teacher Kang Jin also repeatedly publicized the benefits of sports activities in literacy classes, so that every League member and young people realized the purpose and importance of sports activities. Cui Shangzhi, Zhang Qiyuan and other seven militiamen put forward the slogan "Work hard to exercise and prepare to defend the motherland at any time." They said: "If the motherland needs us, we will go." At the same time, under the leadership of the village Party branch, a meeting of Party, Youth League, and administrative cadres was held in the whole village, and it was decided to carry out sports activities in conjunction with militia training. The secretary of the Youth League branch and the militia captain lead this work; and the elementary school teacher and the returned soldier provide technical guidance. After the meeting, the Party and League branch secretaries and the militia captain respectively mobilized Party members, League members, and militiamen to participate. Later, the 43 participants were divided into various sports groups according to their interests and strengths. This activity was carried out with the support of the Party and administration and the active leadership of the League.
    Party Branch Secretary Comrade Cui Ying especially praised the Youth League members for their active leadership and their spirit of overcoming difficulties and creating conditions in this work. He said: The playground was originally a rugged and uneven open space, and the Youth League members took the lead in leveling it. All sports equipment were solved by the youth themselves. Youth League member Zhang Yongwang took out the allocated ball shell, and the Youth League branch cultivated a wasteland to plant sweet potatoes, which were exchanged for a ball bladder to make a soccer ball. The parallel bars, pommel horse, and high jump rack were all made by the secretary of the Youth League branch and the Youth League member Zhang Yongwang and others with old wood. They overcame various difficulties. If they didn't know how to do it, they asked the teachers; if they lacked the equipment to make it, they found a young carpenter to help them complete the work. Youth League members also played a big role in leading the youth. Young Zhang Shengxiang initially thought that sports had no benefits, "Running is too tiring, it is better to sit for a while." Later, after the mobilization and persuasion of the League branch secretary, deputy secretary, League member Zhang Yongwang, Liu Guoren, etc., he participated in sports. Most of the other young people also participated in sports under the leadership of the League members.
    The farmers of Jiantai Village, who live in a happy and pleasant atmosphere, are all very strong. The young people are very cheerful and lively, allowing us to approach them without restraint, play ball and talk together. They said: "In the past, the village was very quiet. During the slack season and the daily evening rest time, the young people had nothing to do and there were no activities. It was so uncomfortable to be either standing or sitting! Since we started sports activities, everyone seems to have gained a new world. If there is nothing to do, we come here to play and practice." This year they also participated in the district's "May 1st" celebration meeting, and performed broadcast gymnastics at the meeting, which was praised by the district People's Government and the villagers of various villages. The villagers said: "The young men of Jiantai Village are all energetic!"
    Sports activities not only make the young people in the village active, but more importantly, it has become an important factor in helping them improve labor efficiency and increase production. All the young people we met said: "After participating in sports, we eat more, are in a good mood, and not only do we not feel weak when we go to the fields, but we also do not feel tired even if we work more." Youth League member and sports activist Zhang Yongwang used to suffer from stomach pain and dizziness, and his body was very weak. He could only work half a day each day. When the weather got hot at noon, he would feel dizzy and couldn't support it, so he had to go home to rest. After participating in sports, his stomach illness was cured, he didn't feel dizzy when he worked a whole day, and he didn't feel tired. In the past, he always lagged behind his father in hoeing the ground, but now he has surpassed his father. This year, his family was selected as the village's bumper harvest household. He was also rated as a learning model in literacy classes. Cui Jianming used to be a lazy man in the village, who did not like to work and had poor physical strength. He would feel weak as soon as he went to the fields. He would work for a while and rest for a while. He could not farm his seven mu of land by himself, and he had to hire others to farm it for him. Later, under the mobilization and education of the Youth League organization, he participated in sports exercises, going earlier than others every day. Whenever he had time, he would practice on the parallel bars and throw hand grenades... Now, his body has become strong and powerful; he has enough strength for production and is full of energy. Not only does he not need to hire others to farm his land, but this year he also actively helped military families carry ice and store water in the drought resistance movement; at the same time, he also participated in literacy classes and was rated as a learning model. Now, he has become an activist in production, learning, and sports in the village. Their facts encourage young people to participate in sports activities. The old people no longer oppose these things of the young people. An old man said: "The young people nowadays not only have proper entertainment, but they can also exercise their bodies. Unlike the young people during the Kuomintang period, who only gambled and visited from door to door all day long."
    The Chahar Sports Branch is very concerned about the sports activities in Jiantai Village. Last December, they sent someone to guide them. Recently, they sent someone again to help them establish a village sports committee. The Youth League members and young people of the village are taking practical actions to realize the bumper harvest plan and are preparing to build a basketball court this year. When we left, they also expressed to us that they have the confidence to further develop sports activities and promote them to nearby villages.

    怀安县尖台寨村的体育活动
    黄作晖
    尖台寨村在察哈尔省中部的怀安县境内。闪闪发光的大洋河从北面流过，这里可以听见十里外的火车飞驰过原野的声音。初夏的夕阳照耀着尖台寨村金黄色的围墙，很远就看见了一幢幢齐整的房屋，交错着茂绿的大杨树。农民们正在忙着完成丰产计划，一望无边的田野里，洋溢着劳动的欢乐。村里的大路、小路上，看不见一个闲人。小学里传来了孩子们愉快的歌声。就在这个傍晚，我们到达了这个村庄。
    三年前，尖台寨村还是一个穷困的村庄，二千一百多亩田地有一千八百多亩掌握在地主手里，农民终年劳动，却得不到温饱。除了地主富农，全村四百八十余人只有四五个人识字。一九四九年农民从地主手里拿回了土地，三年来在共产党和人民政府的领导下，组织了生产互助组，大家用热情的劳动，创造了富裕的生活，每家农户都有足够的粮食，一人每年可以穿上二三套新衣裳。全村有八十多名农民子弟进了小学，七十个农民上了民校，能读报的有三十二人。虽然去年旱灾严重，但他们并不需要人民政府的救济粮，有些困难的农户，大伙互相帮助就可以解决。愁吃愁穿的日子早已过去了。
    今年，尖台寨村是全区丰产村之一，丰产户准备把单位面积产量由四百斤提高到八百五十斤；普遍组织了生产互助组，读报组。他们在抗旱备荒、消灭害虫、抗美援朝捐献、民兵训练、青年文娱活动等方面都有优异的成绩。村里有三十四个党员和十六个青年团员。
    在以上这些有利的条件下，使尖台寨村的体育活动得到很好的开展。
    党支部书记和村长首先领我们去参观了运动场。这个运动场是一块平坦的约二亩大的空地，在村子中部小学校的前面。运动场旁边种着一排小杨树，南面、西面的小斜坡成了天然的看台。跳高、跳远、木马的三个沙坑分别设在场的东北、东南面，北面高高的大树上挂着粗大的长绳。里面还有单杠、拔河、跳绳、手榴弹、足球等体育设备。在这个乡村中，竟有这样多的运动设备。
    这一天傍晚和往日一样，大家结束了一天的劳动，晚饭后不久，就有人开始向操场走去。村中心高处的广播筒发出了高吭引人的声音：“青年同志们！体育活动的时间到了，请快上操场去吧！……”一群青年迅速地在操场聚拢，老乡们和孩子们也到操场上来了。七点半钟左右，活动就由民兵训练开始，经过约二十分钟的操练后，一齐做广播体操。由民兵队长喊口令，大家做得非常整齐、有力。接着就是分组活动了。东面翻单杠的猛转个不停；东南面跳高的，一个个飞越过去；练跳远的在用心纠正自己的姿势；北面的一排人正在接连地跳着木马；练爬绳的已经爬到二丈高的大树上；拔河比赛正在拉锯状态中。场里面有的做着游戏、有的跳绳、有的踢足球。在练习中遇到困难，就去请教小学教员和村里的一位复员军人。小学教员康晋是担任体育课的；复员军人金万富在复员前是解放军中的技巧队员。他们都很乐意指导青年们运动，经常告诉他们怎样跳、怎样跑……。小组练习结束后，就是个人活动。谁愿意练什么就练什么，孩子们也来跳远、跳绳，有一位老头子竟也亲自下场，帮助一队将要失败的孩子们战胜了他们的拔河劲敌。足球更是踢得热闹，大人、小孩、青年都抢着球，把球踢得高高的。操场挤满了人，他们在奔跑、跳跃……。天黑了他们才上民校去。
    现在，虽是农忙季节，大家都把全部力量用来争取实现今年的丰产计划，时间上不容许每天都进行集体活动，就改成三五天进行一次。在不妨碍生产的原则下，青年们对于体育活动的兴趣丝毫没有减低。有十多个体育积极分子从开始到现在没有停止过活动。每天清早和傍晚自动到这里来练习的人也没有减少。天刚刚发亮，就有人在这里练跑步、翻单杠、做体操。有些人到这里挑水，也要翻两下单杠才肯走。每天早晨，生产互助组也在这里集中，先到的组员就抓紧时间练习，人来齐了，才一起下地劳动。这个地方已经成为尖台寨村群众的活动中心了。
    不久以前，他们举行了一次比赛，在运动成绩方面已经有了提高。崔国承的跳高成绩是一·四○公尺，崔建明把手榴弹扔到四十四公尺远，爬绳普遍都能爬到六公尺高。十八至三十五岁的青、壮年和青年妇女们都学会了做广播体操。当修订爱国公约的时候，他们增订了一条“加强民兵训练，加强体育活动”。
    热烈的体育活动在这个村已经进行八个月了，究竟是怎样引起的呢？去年十月秋收后，青年团怀安县委为了贯彻华北区军事体育工作会议的精神，决定培养两个重点村。军事体育委员徐世元认为他原来工作过的村庄——尖台寨村党、团工作有些基础，青年们都很活跃，是有条件作为重点的。党、青年团县委同意这个意见，他就回到自己的村子去进行工作了。以前他是该村的青年团支部书记，因为领导文娱活动和团的工作有成绩而被提拔到县当军事体育委员，在村里的青年群众中有很高的威信，这次回来，受到青年们的欢迎。他的工作首先得到党、青年团、行政领导的重视和帮助，接着他在团员大会上和民校进行动员，宣传体育活动对身体健康和生产、国防的意义。小学教员康晋也在民校上多次宣传体育活动的好处，使每个团员和青年们认识到体育活动的目的和重要性。崔尚智、张起元等七位民兵提出“努力锻炼身体，准备随时保卫祖国”的口号，他们说：“祖国需要我们，我们就去。”同时，在村党支部领导下召开了全村的党、青年团、行政干部会议，决定结合民兵训练开展体育活动。由青年团支部书记、民兵队长领导这个工作；并由小学教员和复员军人作技术指导。会后，由党、团支部书记、民兵队长分别动员党、团员、民兵参加。后来又把参加的四十三人，按各人的爱好和特长编成各种运动小组。这个活动就在党、行政的支持和团的积极带头下开展起来。
    党支部书记崔英同志特别夸耀青年团员们在这件工作上的积极带头和克服困难创造条件的精神。他说：操场原来是一片崎岖不平的空地，青年团员们带头把它修平了；所有的运动器具都是青年们自己解决的。青年团员张永旺拿出分得的球壳，团支部开垦了一块荒地种白薯，换来球胆配成了一个足球。单杠、木马、跳高架都是由青年团支部书记和团员张永旺等几个人用旧木料做成的。他们克服了种种困难，不懂怎样做，就去请教教员；缺乏制作的器具，就找了一位青年木匠，帮助他们完成了这个工作。青年团员在带动青年方面也起很大的作用。青年张生祥在开始时认为体育没有什么好处，“跑步太累不如多坐一会”，后来经过团支部书记、副书记、团员张永旺、刘国仁等的动员和说服教育，他参加运动了。其他的绝大部分的青年也在团员的带动下参加到运动中来。
    生活在幸福、愉快气氛中的尖台寨村的农民一个个都非常健壮。青年们非常开朗、活泼，使我们毫不拘束地和他们接近，在一起踢球和交谈。他们说：“在以前，村子里是很寂静的，在农闲和每天傍晚休息时间，青年们没有事情做，又没有什么活动，不是站着就是坐着，多么不好过啊！自从搞起了体育活动，大家好像得到了一个新的天地，没有事就到这里玩玩练练。”今年他们还参加了区的“五一”节庆祝大会，在会上作了广播体操表演，受到区人民政府和各村老乡们的称赞。老乡们说：“尖台寨村的小伙子个个都精神！”
    体育活动不但使该村的青年人活跃起来，更重要的是它成为帮助他们提高劳动效率、增加生产的重要因素。我们所遇到的青年都说：“参加运动后吃饭吃得多，精神愉快，下地不但身体不发软，多干活也不感到疲劳。”青年团员、体育积极分子张永旺以前常患胃痛、头晕，身体很弱。每天只能干半天活，到中午天气热了，就头晕，支持不住，不得不回家休息。参加运动后，胃病好了，干一天活不头晕，也不觉得怎样累。他过去锄地总落在父亲的后面，现在已超过他父亲了。今年他家被选为村的丰产户。在民校学习方面，他也被评为学习模范。崔建明过去是该村的懒汉，不爱劳动，体力很差，一下地身体就发软，干一会，歇一会，自己种七亩地还种不了，得请别人种。后来他在青年团组织的动员和教育下，参加了体育锻炼，每天去得比人早，一有空就去练单杠、扔手榴弹……现在，他的身体已经变得健壮有力；生产力气足，劲头大。自己的地不但不用请别人种，而且今年在抗旱备荒运动中，他还积极帮助军属背冰蓄水；同时他也参加了民校，并被评为学习模范。现在，他已成为该村的生产、学习和体育的积极分子。他们的事实鼓舞着青年们参加体育活动。老人们对青年人这些事也不表示反对了。有一位老爹爹说：“现在的青年不仅有了正当的娱乐，还可以锻炼身体。不像在国民党时期的青年人，整天只是赌博、串门子。”
    察哈尔体育分会对尖台寨村的体育活动是很关怀的。去年十二月曾派人去指导他们，最近又派人去帮助他们成立了村的体育委员会。该村的青年团员和青年们正以实际行动实现丰产计划并准备在今年建立一个篮球场。我们临走时他们还向我们表示有信心把体育活动进一步开展起来，并推广到附近的村庄去。
