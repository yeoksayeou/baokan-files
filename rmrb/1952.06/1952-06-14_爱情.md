    Love
    Fang Qing

    (I)
    In LinYi County, Shandong Province, there is a village called Gaijia Cave. People live on both sides of the hillside, with a small ditch in the middle. Two old men lived directly across from each other: Old Man Wang had suffered since childhood, and two of his three sons had starved to death. Only the eldest son, Wang Jichun, was left. At the age of eleven, he began working for the landlord. Regardless of wind or rain, he had to carry a basket to cut grass in the fields at dawn. Old Man Song had only one daughter, Song Yuying, who was very pretty. She had been making tofu with her father since she was a child. She was also very capable, just like a young man.

    When Wang Jichun carried his basket to the fields, Song Yuying often came out to pour water with a basin. Standing at the door, watching him walk away, she would cough and then go back home. She kept thinking to herself: "When will poor people ever get ahead!"

    Wang Jichun would sometimes secretly glance at her, but every time he did, he would see Song Yuying staring at him intently. Wang Jichun would quickly turn his face away and walk on.

    They lived so close, meeting every day, you have me in your heart, I have you in my heart, but neither of them thought about talking to each other. As time went on, the two old men saw the young people's feelings and got together. Once they brought up the matter, they both felt it was a good idea. They went home and told their son and daughter, and the two young people were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths.

    In February 1945, they got engaged. The man was nineteen years old, and the woman was seventeen. They immediately chose a good day – October 1st – to get married.

    From then on, Song Yuying often went to Wang Jichun's house. She helped him and his father – there were only the two of them in his family – with sewing, grinding wheat, and making pancakes. Often, she would finish cooking for her own family in advance, and when it was time to cook, she would run to Wang's house to help them cook. But she was too shy to eat at Wang's house. When it was time to eat, she would run back to her own house.

    In June of that year, the Eighth Route Army drove away the Japanese devils there and liberated Gaijia Cave. Wang Jichun and a dozen other young men joined the Eighth Route Army. When he was about to leave—

    Wang Jichun said, "Your dad and mine will have to rely on you..." Because the Song family also consisted of just him and his daughter.

    Song Yuying said, "Go without worry, you don't need to worry about it!"

    Wang Jichun said, "What about October 1st?"

    Song Yuying said, "October 1st... if you can come back, we'll get married; if you can't, we'll wait a few years, we're both still young."

    Wang Jichun was busy fighting the Japanese devils and didn't have time to go home. In August, the Soviet Union sent troops to fight Japan. Wang Jichun's unit was heading to the Northeast, where they joined forces with the Soviet army and defeated the Japanese devils.

    At this time, a group of Kuomintang troops sneaked into Gaijia Cave. Old Man Song saw the chaos and, on October 1st, sent his daughter to Wang's house.

    (II)

    After Wang Jichun arrived in the Northeast, he joined the Chinese Communist Party the following year. He always stood on the front line of the Liberation War, going through dozens of battles and being wounded twice. The last time was in October 1948 – the last battle of the Northeast Liberation War – when his shinbone in his left leg was shattered.

    In the hospital bed, Wang Jichun suddenly thought of home. For the past three years, he had been busy fighting the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries and hadn't thought about home. The trains weren't running, and he couldn't send a letter even if he wanted to, so he simply didn't think about it. Now, seeing in the newspaper that the trains were running in Guanzhong, he immediately remembered that he should write a letter home. Although he had never been to school, he studied well in the army and could write a letter without even drafting it. He asked after his father, but didn't dare to ask about Song Yuying. He finally mentioned in one sentence that he had been injured. In a few days, a reply came. Song Yuying was very concerned about his injury and especially asked how he had been wounded.

    The second letter from Wang Jichun began by explaining this:

    "At that time, I was a platoon leader. I was leading the whole platoon to attack the enemy's
    village, my left leg was injured, and I couldn't walk at all.
    But I didn't leave the battlefield, I sat there and directed the troops
    to continue advancing, successfully completing the combat mission—occupying
    this village, completely annihilating an enemy platoon, earning
    the entire platoon a great achievement for this battle."
    The above paragraph was written in one breath. He should have mentioned his leg next, but he put down his pen and thought for a long time without writing. If he wrote the truth – that his bone was shattered and he was a third-class disabled soldier – his family would definitely worry. And if he said that Song Yuying knew, would she still treat me as well as before? If he didn't write it, it wouldn't work either, he couldn't hide it from anyone forever. After thinking for a while, he always felt that he would be letting his family down if he didn't write clearly. In the end, he wrote the truth; the letter also specially comforted his father, telling him not to worry.

    This time, when he received a letter from home again, Wang Jichun was still worried that it would bring bad news. But he was completely wrong. Song Yuying greeted him more warmly than in the previous letter, encouraged him, and said that his injury was honorable. In her tone, Wang Jichun fully realized: "She loves me even more than before!"

    (III)

    During the Spring Festival of 1945, the Kuomintang bandit army was driven away, and Gaijia Cave was filled with gongs and drums. The villagers gave the Wang family an honor plaque. Song Yuying's face flushed. At that time, she thought to herself: "He earned this honor for me; I must be worthy of him!"

    Soon, when the villagers struggled against the puppet village chief Chen Fengsheng, Song Yuying led the women at the very front, pointing at his nose and reasoning with him, counting how he had harmed women by relying on the power of the Japanese devils. Everyone in the village could see that she was really good. After the meeting, the Women's Association was organized, and all the women in the village unanimously elected Song Yuying as the president.

    At this time, Chen Fengsheng's mother secretly sneaked to Wang's house and quietly said to Song Yuying: "Your man hasn't sent any news, who knows if he's dead or alive; you're so young, you have to leave yourself an out... and you haven't even slept with him..."

    Song Yuying ignored her.

    Half a year after struggling against Chen Fengsheng, the People's Liberation Army was ordered to transfer. A group of Kuomintang bandit troops sneaked into Gaijia Cave, and Chen Fengsheng became the village chief again and arrested Song Yuying for revenge. He first asked her:

    "Where did your man go? If you don't tell me, I'll beat you to death!"

    "I don't know!" Song Yuying was very firm.

    "Beat her!" Chen Fengsheng's words were followed by his fists.

    "..." Song Yuying didn't cry or scream.

    "Who told you to be the president of the Women's Association?"

    "Everyone elected me!"

    "Beat her!"...

    Song Yuying didn't give in at all. Chen Fengsheng stared blankly, helpless.

    At this time, Chen Fengsheng's mother came to Song Yuying again, putting her mouth close to Song Yuying's ear: "Just go along with this! I'll find you a suitable man; rich and powerful..."

    Song Yuying ignored her.

    Two or three months later, the People's Liberation Army returned, wiping out the Kuomintang bandit troops. Song Yuying became the president of the Women's Association again, still standing at the very front, leading the women of the village to participate in the land reform. Chen Fengsheng was overthrown, the landlord's land was distributed, and the poor people were completely liberated. When Song Yuying thought of Wang Jichun's early mornings cutting grass in the fields, she couldn't help but say to herself: "This is really the end of hardship!"

    In 1949, Song Yuying received a letter from Wang Jichun. She was concerned about his wound and felt that he had made great achievements and was even more glorious. Looking back at the hardships of the past, and looking at the glory of the present. It was indeed as Wang Jichun had thought – she loved him even more.

    (IV)

    After Wang Jichun recovered from his injury, he stayed in a veterans' school for a few months and was then assigned to work at the Fuerji River Veterans' Farm in Songjiang Province, serving as a squad leader. As soon as he arrived, he went to the mountains to pull large logs, which was very strenuous work. Wang Jichun disregarded his injury and always ran to the front, working as hard as the comrades in the team, and also had to manage administrative matters. He was often straining to lift logs on the one hand, and gritting his teeth on the other - to eliminate the pain brought by bone fragments.

    He was single-minded, only thinking about how to complete the production task, never considering whether his body could handle such heavy labor.

    Once, he was already very tired but refused to rest. The road on the mountain was slippery, and his leg was still injured; as a result, the logs on two trucks collided, squeezing him in the middle and breaking his shinbone in his right leg. The comrades wanted to send him to the hospital, but Wang Jichun opposed it. He suggested treating him on site. He said, "I don't want to leave the comrades in the team even for a moment!"

    While he was recovering from his injuries, the comrades all wanted to find time to visit him. But every time they came, it turned into a temporary report meeting. Wang Jichun carefully asked about the situation of the team's work. Then, based on the specific situation, he patiently gave his opinions, using various metaphors to encourage the comrades' labor enthusiasm. Later, when his injury was better and he could go to the ground on crutches, he followed the truck up the mountain to pull logs.

    Should he write home or not – both legs are crippled, and when you touch them, the bones stick out. He can barely walk slowly; needless to say running, he can't even walk quickly. If he writes, firstly, the old man will worry, and secondly, Song Yuying will know... Wang Jichun considered this again. But if he doesn't write, he won't be able to hide it. What should he do? After thinking about it, he suddenly remembered the situation when he was injured last time and wrote home, and found the key. So he wrote a long letter in great detail, from beginning to end—how important the farm work was, how hard the work was, how actively he was working, how he was injured... He wrote everything. Quietly waiting for a letter from home.

    (V)

    In July 1950, Wang Jichun went to the mountains to pull charcoal. When he came back, the comrades were all looking at him and laughing, but they didn't say anything. He looked through the glass into the team's office and saw an old man and a young woman talking and laughing with several comrades. Wang Jichun thought they were the comrades' family members and didn't pay much attention. When he went into the room, he realized that they were his own family members. He went up and took his father's hand and asked how he had come. After saying just a few words, his eyes fell on Song Yuying.

    After being separated for more than five years, meeting again was naturally very happy. And there was another level? He was especially grateful to Song Yuying from the bottom of his heart – because he had doubted that Song Yuying would change her mind; now she had traveled more than five thousand miles to come to his side. Therefore, his emotions were particularly excited at this time, and his mouth was open, but he hadn't thought of what to say to her.

    Song Yuying was in a different mood: she felt that the person standing in front of her was no longer Wang Jichun, who used to carry a basket to cut grass. He was a hero on the battlefield, a model in production. For the revolution, for the people, his body was crippled, but he still worked tirelessly. How glorious he is! I really have to learn from him and progress with him... At this time, her face became even more radiant, and her eyes became even brighter.

    Now, Wang Jichun is the instructor of the first team of the Fuerji River Veterans' Farm, and Song Yuying is actively learning culture and technology. The lives of the husband and wife are unspeakably sweet.

    爱情
    方青
    （一）
    山东省临沂县有个村子叫盖家洞。人们住在两边山坡上，当中是一道小水沟。有两个老头住在紧对门：王老头从小就受苦受难，三个儿子饿死了两个。只剩个大儿子王纪纯，十一岁就给地主家扛活。不论刮风下雨，天一亮就得背着筐下地割草。宋老头跟前只有一个闺女，叫宋玉英，长的很俊，从小就跟着她爹做豆腐。干活又挺泼实，像个小伙子一样。
    王纪纯背着筐下地的时候，宋玉英常常端着盆出来倒水。站在门口，眼看着他走远了，她才“咳”一声回家去。心里反来覆去地想着：“穷人什么时候才能熬到头呀！”
    王纪纯有时也偷偷地瞅她一眼，可是每次都碰到宋玉英正瞪着眼使劲看他。王纪纯便赶紧扭过脸来走了。
    他俩住的那么近，天天见面，你心里有我，我心里有你，可是谁也没有想到在一块儿去谈谈话。日子一长，两个老头都看出年轻人的心情了，凑到一块儿，一拉扯这个事，两人都挺投心思。他俩回家又和儿子、闺女一说，两个年轻人乐得连嘴都闭不上。
    一九四五年二月两人订了婚。男的十九岁，女的十七岁。当时就选择了好日子——十月一日结婚。
    从这以后，宋玉英就常到王纪纯家去。帮助他爷儿俩——他家只有这两口人——做些针线活儿，推推麦子，烙烙煎饼。也常有这种时候——她提前抽工夫先做好自己家的饭，到做饭的时候就跑到王家去，帮助他们家里做饭。可是又不好意思在王家吃。一到吃饭的时候，就又跑到自己家里来。
    就在这一年的六月，八路军打跑了那里的日本鬼子，解放了盖家洞。王纪纯和其他十来个青年都参加了八路军。临出发的时候——
    王纪纯说：“咱俩的爹都得靠着你……”因为宋家也是只他父女二人。
    宋玉英说：“放心走吧，用不着你操心！”
    王纪纯说：“十月一的事呢？”
    宋玉英说：“十月一……能回来就结，不能回来就过几年，还都年轻。”
    王纪纯忙着打日本鬼子，也没得回家。到八月里，苏联出兵打日本。王纪纯这个部队正开到东北，和苏联军队联合起来，打败了日本鬼子。
    正在这时，盖家洞窜来了一股国民党军队。宋老头一看，兵慌马乱地，到了十月一，就把闺女送到王家去。
    （二）
    王纪纯到了东北，第二年就参加了中国共产党。他始终站在解放战争的最前线，先后经过几十次战斗，负过两次伤。后一次是在一九四八年十月——东北解放战争的最后一仗——把左腿的迎门骨打碎了。
    在病床上，王纪纯忽然想起家来。前三年，光忙着跟日本侵略者和国民党反动派打仗，没有想到家；火车又不通，想写封信也寄不走，干脆也就不想这个事了。现在看到报纸上说：关里的火车通了，他马上就想起来——应当给家里去封信。他虽说从小没念过一天书，可是在部队里学习的挺好，写封信连草稿都不用打，动笔就写。问候问候他爹，没好意思问宋玉英。最后也提到一句——自己受了伤。不几天就来了回信，宋玉英很关心他的伤，还特别问他是怎样负的伤。
    王纪纯的第二封家信，一开头就说这回事：
    “那时我就当了排长。正领着全排攻击敌人
    一个村庄，我的左腿带伤了，一步也走不得。
    可是我并没有退出战场，还坐在那里指挥队伍
    继续前进，胜利地完成了战斗任务——占领了
    这个村庄，全部歼灭敌人一个排的兵力，为这
    次战役，全排立了一大功。”
    上面这一段话，是他一口气写下来的。下面就应该提到他的腿了，他搁下笔，寻思了半天没有写。要是照实写——骨头打碎了，落了个三等残废，家里一定挂心；再一说：宋玉英知道了，还能像以前那么对我好吗？不写呢，也不行，天长日久谁也瞒不了。想了一会儿，老是觉着不写清楚对不起家里人。后来还是照实写了；信里又特别安慰他爹，不要挂念。
    这一次再接到家里来信时，王纪纯还耽心会带来什么坏消息。但是他完全想错了。宋玉英比上一封信更亲热地问候他，鼓励他，说他的伤是光荣的，在口气上，王纪纯完全体会出来：“她比以前更爱我了！”
    （三）
    一九四五年过年的时候，国民党匪军被打跑了，盖家洞锣鼓喧天，村民们吹吹打打，给王家送来了光荣匾。宋玉英的脸一阵阵发烧。当时她这样想：“这个光荣是他给俺挣来的；俺也得对得起他！”
    不久，全村人民在斗争伪村长陈凤生时，宋玉英领导着妇女站在最头前，手指着鼻子尖和他讲理，数说他仗着日本鬼子的势力，怎么坑害妇女。全村的人们都看得出来——她真是好样的。开完这个会就组织了妇女会，全村妇女公推宋玉英当会长。
    正在这个时候，陈凤生的娘偷偷地蹓到王家来，悄悄地跟宋玉英说：“你男人也没个信，谁知道是死是活；你年轻轻地，可要留个后手儿……又没和他同房……”
    宋玉英理也没理她。
    斗争陈凤生的半年以后，人民解放军奉命转移。盖家洞窜过来一股子国民党匪军，陈凤生又当了村长，把宋玉英抓去报仇。先问她：
    “你男人上哪里去了？不说就打死你！”
    “不知道！”宋玉英非常坚决。
    “打！”陈凤生嘴到手就到。
    “……”宋玉英一声也不哭，也不叫。
    “谁叫你当妇女会长？”
    “大伙儿选的！”
    “打！”………
    宋玉英一点也不屈服。陈凤生干瞪眼没办法。
    这时候，陈凤生的娘又来找宋玉英了，把嘴伸到宋玉英的耳朵边上：“随了这头吧！我给你找个合适的人儿；又有钱，又有势……”
    宋玉英理也没有理她。
    两、三个月以后，人民解放军回来了，把国民党匪军消灭得干干净净。宋玉英又当了妇女会长，还是站在最头前，领导全村妇女参加土地改革。斗倒了陈凤生，分了地主的地，穷苦人彻底翻了身。宋玉英一想起从前王纪纯起早下地割草的情景，不由得自言自语地说：“这可真是熬到头了！”
    一九四九年，宋玉英接到王纪纯的信。又关心他的伤口，又感到他立了大功，更加光荣。回想一下从前的苦处，再看一看现在的光荣。确是像王纪纯想的那样——她更加爱他了。
    （四）
    王纪纯养好了伤，住了几个月的荣军学校，便分配到松江省的伏尔基河荣军农场去工作，担任分队长。乍一来就到山上去拉大木头，这是个很吃劲的劳动。王纪纯不顾自己的伤，事事跑到前面，和队上的同志们一样干活，还得管理行政上的事。他常常是一方面用着劲抬木头，另一方面还得咬着牙——排除碎骨带来的痛苦。
    他一心无二用，只想到怎么完成生产任务，从不考虑自己的身体能不能担任这种重劳动。
    有一次，他已经很累了，还不肯休息。山上路又滑，他的腿还有病；结果两辆车上的木头碰了头，把他挤在当间儿，又把他右腿的迎门骨撞碎了。同志们要往医院里送，可是王纪纯反对这样做。他提议就在现场治疗。他说：“我一时也不想离开队上的同志们！”
    养伤的时候，同志们都想抽工夫来看看他。可是，每次来时，都变成个临时的汇报会。王纪纯仔细问着分队工作的情形。然后就针对具体情况，耐心地讲自己的意见，用各种比喻，来鼓舞同志们的劳动热情。后来伤势比较好些，能拄着双拐下地的时候，他便跟着车上山去拉木头了。
    给不给家里写信呢——两条腿都成了残废，用手一摸，骨头都鼓出来了。勉勉强强还能慢慢走动走动；不用说是跑，紧走两步都不行。写信吧，一者老人挂念，二者宋玉英知道了……王纪纯又考虑到这一层了。可是不写又瞒不过去。怎么办呢？左思右想，他一下想起上次负伤给家里写信的情形，便找到了窍门。于是他详详细细，源源本本，写了挺长一封信——农场的工作多么重要，工作多么艰苦，自己工作又是多么积极，怎么负的伤……都写上了。静等着家里的来信。
    （五）
    一九五○年七月，王纪纯到山里去拉木炭。回来的时候，同志们都瞅着他笑，就是什么也不说。他隔着玻璃往队部屋里一看，有一个老头和一个年轻的妇女，正和几个同志在一块说笑。王纪纯以为是同志们的家属，没大注意。进屋一看呢，原来是他自己的家属。他上去就拉起他爹的手，问是怎么来的。刚说了两句话，眼睛就溜到宋玉英身上去了。
    离开了五年多，乍一见面，自然是说不出有多么高兴来。还有一层呢？他从心坎里特别感激宋玉英——因为他以前怀疑过宋玉英会变心；现在她跑了五千多里地来到自己的身边。因此他这个时候感情特别激动，嘴都张开了，心里还没有想起来要跟她说什么。
    宋玉英是另一种心情：她感到站在自己面前的，不是以前背着筐割草的王纪纯了。他是战场上的英雄，是生产中的模范。为了革命，为了人民，自己的身子成了残废，还不住气地工作，工作。他，多么光荣啊！俺可真得好好向他学习，跟着他一块进步……这时，她脸上越发光彩，眼睛越发明亮。
    现在，王纪纯当了伏尔基河荣军农场第一分场的指导员，宋玉英正积极学文化，学技术，夫妻俩的生活，说不尽有多么甜蜜。
