    Soviet "Izvestia" Commentator
    Comments on Alexander's Far East Trip
    British Public Dissatisfied with US Delaying Negotiations

    [Xinhua News Agency, June 17] TASS Moscow, June 14th: The British Secretary of Defense Alexander and Deputy Foreign Minister Lloyd arrived in Tokyo on the 11th. TASS Moscow reported on the 14th that "Izvestia" commentator Kudryavtsev wrote an article commenting on this matter, saying: "The British public, seeing the recent developments in the Korean situation, is increasingly expressing deep dissatisfaction. This situation prompted them to begin this trip."

    Kudryavtsev wrote: "The Korean situation once again proves most convincingly who wants to indefinitely delay the Korean armistice negotiations. The US side is delaying the negotiations on the repatriation of prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' but is actually conspiring to forcibly incorporate tens of thousands of prisoners of war into the bandit armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek."

    "Clark, Van Fleet, and Bonner are still carrying out massacres on Geoje Island with the ferocious methods of the Hitlerite murderous gang. This massacre has shattered the last bit of sophistry of the American ruling clique's obstruction of negotiations, and has aroused great indignation in all countries of the world."

    Kudryavtsev pointed out: "Fearing the fierce reaction of the people of the world, the US military command decided to cover up its crimes with the flag of the United Nations, so it hastily dispatched British and Canadian troops to Geoje Island. After this, the indignation in Britain became particularly high. The situation in South Korea also fueled this emotion. US and British propaganda has endlessly insisted that the interventionist forces are fighting in Korea to establish 'democratic' principles in Korea. But Syngman Rhee, who they have fostered, has begun to arrest members of the 'National Assembly,' declare martial law in many areas, and threaten to调回(transfer back) South Korean troops from the front lines to strengthen his dictatorial rule. These unfortunate propagandists are now truly embarrassed. Syngman Rhee's actions show that his rule in South Korea is a replica of the 'kill-and-beat-up' (secret agent) rule established by the US authorities on Geoje Island."

    Kudryavtsev pointed out: "Influential British newspapers have called for 'Britain to play a more active role in formulating the United Nations' Far East policy.'" He said: "Behind Alexander and Lloyd's trip to the Far East, the increasingly sharp Anglo-American contradictions are emerging."

    Kudryavtsev concluded: "It can be predicted that Alexander and Lloyd's trip will not achieve the goals hoped for by the British ruling clique. The Korean gamble has been exposed in front of world public opinion, which its unfortunate organizers cannot gloss over with any tricks."

    [Xinhua News Agency, June 17] TASS London: British weekly newspapers published articles discussing the Korean situation in connection with the visit of British Defense Minister Alexander and Deputy Foreign Minister Lloyd to Korea. The articles in various newspapers expressed anxiety about the US atrocities of killing prisoners of war and delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, which will inevitably make Britain share the responsibility. Some newspapers said that Britain should participate in the negotiations. The newspapers also called for an armistice agreement to be concluded as soon as possible.

    The editorial of "Reynolds News" said: "The British people are deeply dissatisfied with the progress of the Korean armistice negotiations. In the dozens of meetings that have already been held, no British or Commonwealth representatives have participated. All negotiations have been conducted by American officers.

    This prisoner incident is already stinking. Since the announcement of this incident, things happen every week that show that the method of screening prisoners and the way Americans manage prisoner camps are wrong. The reason why this is happening is that MacArthurism exists in the US military supreme command in Tokyo and the highest government agencies in the United States."

    The "People's Daily" emphasized in an editorial that the reason why the Korean armistice agreement has been hindered is only because "the United Nations (actually the United States) refuses to exchange all prisoners."

    The newspaper said: "One of the rules stipulated in the Geneva Convention is that after the armistice, all prisoners of war must be repatriated. Britain cannot violate this international law and say 'no' to the Chinese, but we have done so because we believed what the United States said about the number of prisoners who did not want to return home. Now that the situation in the Geoje Island prisoner camp, where the majority of prisoners are detained, has been revealed, can we continue to believe those words?"

    The "Sunday Pictorial" published an article by its reporter Jacobson entitled "Eliminate this Unclean Confusion!" which called for an end to the Korean War.

    When talking about Alexander and Lloyd's visit to Korea, Jacobson wrote: "Now is the critical moment for British politicians to participate in ending a situation that has become a mess."

### 苏联“消息报”评论员  评论亚历山大远东之行  英国舆论不满美国拖延谈判

    苏联“消息报”评论员
    评论亚历山大远东之行
    英国舆论不满美国拖延谈判
    【新华社十七日讯】英国国防大臣亚历山大和副外交大臣劳埃德在十一日飞抵东京。据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：“消息报”评论员库德里雅夫采夫撰文评论此事说：英国公众看到朝鲜最近局势的演变，愈来愈普遍地表示深切的不满，这种情况，促使他们开始这次旅行。
    库德里雅夫采夫写道：朝鲜局势再一次最有说服力地表明究竟谁想无限期拖延朝鲜停战谈判。美方在所谓“自愿遣返”的藉口下拖延遣返战俘的问题的谈判，而实际上是阴谋把成千成万的战俘强迫编入李承晚和蒋介石匪军中。
    克拉克、范佛里特和波纳直到今天还在以希特勒杀人匪帮的凶恶手段在巨济岛进行屠杀，这种屠杀已把美国统治集团阻挠谈判的最后一点强辩的理由，打得粉碎，并引起世界各国的极大愤慨。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出：害怕世界人民激烈反应的美军司令部，决定用联合国的旗帜来遮盖它的罪行，所以慌忙派遣英国和加拿大的部队到巨济岛去，在这之后，英国的愤慨情绪就特别高涨起来。南朝鲜的局势也给这种情绪火上加油。美英的宣传曾无休止地硬说干涉军在朝鲜作战是为了在朝鲜奠立“民主”的原则。但是在他们豢养下的李承晚却开始逮捕“国民议会”的议员、在许多地区宣布戒严并扬言从前线调回南朝鲜军队来加强他的独裁统治。这些倒霉的宣传家现在真是窘迫不堪。李承晚的行动表明了他在南朝鲜的统治，是美国当局在巨济岛上建立的“格杀打扑”（特务）统治的复本。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出：英国有影响的报纸纷纷要求“英国在制订联合国的远东政策中起更积极的作用”。他说道：在亚历山大和劳埃德远东之行的后面，正显现着越来越尖锐的英美矛盾。
    库德里雅夫采夫结语说道：可以预料，亚历山大和劳埃德之行并不会达到英国统治集团所希望的目的。朝鲜赌局已在全世界舆论面前暴露，这是它的倒霉的组织者用任何巧计都粉饰不了的。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国的各星期日报纸刊载文章，就英国国防大臣亚历山大和副外交大臣劳埃德访问朝鲜一事论述朝鲜形势。各报的文章对于美国杀害战俘的暴行和拖延朝鲜停战谈判势必使英国分担责任一事咸表焦虑。一些报纸说：英国应参加谈判。各报还要求尽早缔结停战协定。
    “雷诺新闻”的社论说：“英国人民对朝鲜停战谈判的进行情况，深为不满。在已经举行过的几十次会议中，一次也没有英国或联邦代表参加。一切谈判都是由美国军官进行的。
    这个俘虏事件已是臭气薰天。自从这个事件宣布以后，每个星期都有一些事情说明甄别俘虏的方法及美国人管理俘虏营的方法都是不对的。其所以会如此的原因是东京的美军最高司令部和美国的最高政府机构内存在着麦克阿瑟主义。”
    “人民报”在社论中强调说：朝鲜停战协定的获致之所以受到阻碍，只是因为“联合国（实际上是美国）拒绝交换全部俘虏”。
    该报说：“日内瓦公约规定的一条规则是：停战以后，战俘必须全部遣返。英国不能破坏这个国际法而对中国人说‘不行’，但是我们确曾这样做了，这是因为我们相信了美国所说的关于不愿回国的俘虏人数的话。现在拘押大多数俘虏的巨济岛俘虏营的情况既然已透露出来了，我们还能够继续相信那些话吗？”
    “星期日画刊”以“消除这种不洁的混乱状态！”为题刊载了该报记者贾考伯逊的一篇文章，文中要求停止朝鲜战争。
    贾考伯逊谈到亚历山大和劳埃德访问朝鲜一事时写道：“现在已经是英国政治家参加结束已成为一团糟的局面的紧要时机了。”
