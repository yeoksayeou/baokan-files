Most cotton-growing areas across the country have completed their cotton sowing work by mid-May, except for some areas in the Yangtze River basin where it is still ongoing. Areas where sowing has been completed are now conducting seedling checks and protection. According to preliminary statistics, the cotton field area this year has basically stabilized at last year's level.

The emergence of seedlings in cotton fields across various regions is generally good. In the Guanzhong and South Shaanxi areas of Shaanxi Province, most cotton fields have produced strong seedlings; in Mengyin County, Shandong Province, 80% of the cotton fields had emerged by the end of April, with the seedlings being large, robust, and uniform; in Leping County, Jiangxi Province, cotton seedlings are already about five inches tall. In some areas, due to early sowing, seedling rot and missing seedlings have occurred. In Wu'an County, Hebei Province, Anyang Prefecture in Pingyuan Province, and Jinzhou and other areas in West Liaoning Province, the emergence of seedlings has been uneven due to lower temperatures. These areas are currently carrying out replanting and transplantation work.

In order to implement the policy of increasing cotton field yield per unit area and prevent blind expansion of cotton fields, leading organizations at all levels in cotton-growing areas, in addition to publicizing the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council's policy of adjusting the cotton-grain price ratio and burden policy, have also conducted patriotic ideological education for cadres and farmers. Hebei Province has put forward the slogan "Growing more cotton last year was a patriotic act, and growing more grain this year is also a patriotic act"; Shanxi, Pingyuan, and other provinces have also paid attention to correcting the tendency of blindly expanding cotton fields; governments at all levels have also dispatched a large number of personnel, led by leading cadres themselves, to go to the countryside to inspect cotton sowing work, which has timely corrected the tendency of blindly expanding cotton fields.

Cotton farmers in various regions have generally seen a surge in production enthusiasm during the patriotic production increase campaign. Tillage and harrowing of general cotton fields have been better than last year. In Shanxi Province, the number of tillage and harrowing operations has generally increased by two times compared to last year. Cotton farmers in Henan Province have tilled and harrowed seven or eight times. The Subei cotton-growing area, which has historically lacked a habit of cultivating land, has also promoted spring plowing this spring. This year, fertilizer application in cotton fields in various regions is also more than in previous years. In the Linyi and Jiaozhou prefectures of Shandong Province, each mu of cotton field has received an additional half to one cart of coarse manure compared to last year. In Dongliu County in the Subei area, the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields has increased by about 10% compared to last year. In Yu County, Henan Province, cotton fields rarely received fertilizer in the past, but this year each mu has received 2,000 jin of base fertilizer. This year's seed selection work before sowing in various regions has also been better than last year. In the high-quality seed areas of Shaanxi Province, cotton seeds have largely been selected by individual seed. In order to promote the cotton seed selection campaign, most areas of West Liaoning Province have held seed selection training classes.

Before sowing cotton, cotton farmers in various regions launched a wave of learning from advanced cotton planting experiences. In the spring of this year, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, held a symposium of cotton production area representatives to discuss Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience, breaking conservative ideas and enabling these representatives to further understand cotton planting techniques. On April 17th, Liaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, held a cotton farmer representative meeting to learn from Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, enhancing cotton farmers' confidence in achieving high yields. On April 8th, the Dezhou Prefecture of Shandong Province held a meeting of county heads, mutual aid team leaders, and labor models to learn from Qu Yaoli's high-yield experience.

However, the following issues in various cotton-growing areas urgently need to be resolved:

(1) Due to the warm winter and little snow last year, cotton aphids have appeared earlier this year, and cotton aphids have begun to spread in some areas. Aphids have been found on most cotton seedlings in the Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Shangqiu prefectures of Henan Province; aphids have also been found in Pingyuan and Shaanxi; therefore, preventing and controlling cotton aphids has become a very urgent task at present. Hebei Province has proposed the slogan of universally eliminating cotton aphids once before the wheat harvest, which is very correct. All regions must be highly vigilant, mobilize and organize the masses to check at any time, and eliminate them in a timely manner. Agricultural departments and cooperatives at all levels should fully prepare medicines and machinery, and supply them to cotton farmers in a timely manner, in order to implement the spirit of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment," and lead the masses to timely and thoroughly eliminate cotton aphids, ensuring a bumper cotton harvest.

(2) In many areas, due to sowing too early or poor sowing techniques, the phenomenon of missing seedlings has occurred; these areas must seize the time, conduct seedling checks in a timely manner, and vigorously promote replanting and transplantation to ensure full seedlings.

(3) This year, the supply of chemical fertilizers, bean cakes, and other fine fertilizers in various regions has increased compared to last year, which is a favorable condition for ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. According to the actual conditions in their respective regions, all regions should combine irrigation, pruning, and local rainfall conditions before the cotton plants bud and flower, implement phased fertilization, and overcome the tendency of applying fertilizer too early, too late, or blindly applying a large amount of fertilizer at one time.

    全国大部地区棉苗出土情况良好
    现应抓紧查苗补苗并及早注意防治棉蚜
    全国各地棉花播种工作，截至五月中旬，除长江流域部分地区还在继续进行外，大部棉区已经结束。已经播种完毕的地区，正进行查苗、保苗工作。今年棉田面积，据初步统计，基本上稳定在去年的水平上。
    各地棉田的出苗情况一般很好。陕西关中、陕南地区的棉田，已大部生出健壮的苗棵；山东省蒙阴县的棉田，在四月底已出苗百分之八十，棉苗肥大整齐；江西省乐平县棉苗已高约五寸许。部分地区因播种过早，发生了烂苗、缺苗现象。河北省武安县、平原省安阳专区和辽西省锦州等地区的棉田，由于气温降低，出苗不齐。这些地区正进行补种和移植工作。
    为贯彻提高棉田单位面积产量的方针，防止盲目扩大棉田，棉区各级领导机构除宣传中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布的调整棉粮比价及负担政策外，并对干部和农民进行了爱国主义思想教育。河北省提出了“去年多种棉花是爱国表现，今年多种粮食也是爱国表现”的口号；山西、平原等省也注意，纠正了盲目扩大棉田的偏向；各级政府并抽出大批人员，由领导干部亲自带领下乡，检查棉花播种工作，这就及时地纠正了盲目扩大棉田的偏向。
    各地棉农在爱国丰产竞赛运动中，生产情绪普遍高涨。一般棉田耕耙都比去年好。山西省耕耙次数一般比去年增加两次。河南省棉农有耕耙到七、八遍的。苏北棉区一向无耕地习惯，今春也推行了春耕翻土工作。今年各地棉田施肥也较往年为多。山东省临沂、胶州两专区的棉田，每亩比去年增施粗粪半车至一车。苏北区东流县棉田施肥量比去年增加百分之十左右。河南省?县的棉田过去很少施肥，今年每亩都上了二千斤底肥。今年各地播种前的选种工作，也比去年做得好。陕西省良种区的棉籽大部实行了粒选。辽西省为了推动棉籽粒选运动，大部地区都举办了粒选训练班。
    各地棉农在播种棉花前，曾掀起了学习先进植棉经验的热潮。陕西省长安县在今年春天召开了棉产区代表座谈会，讨论了曲耀离的丰产经验，打破了保守思想，使这些代表对植棉技术有了进一步的认识。平原省聊城县在四月十七日召开了棉农代表会，学习曲耀离的植棉经验，提高了棉农的丰产信心。山东省德州专区四月八日召开的县长、互助组长、劳动模范会议，学习曲耀离的丰产经验。
    但目前各棉区还有下列几个问题，亟需解决：
    （一）因去年冬季天暖雪少，今年各地棉蚜发生较早，若干地区棉蚜已经开始蔓延。河南省洛阳、郑州、商邱等专区大部棉苗都已发现蚜虫；平原、陕西各地也已发现蚜虫；因此，防治棉蚜已成为目前非常紧迫的任务。河北省提出在麦收前普遍除治棉蚜一遍的口号，这是十分正确的。各地必须提高警惕，动员与组织群众随时检查，及时除治。各级农业部门及合作社应充分准备药械，及时供应棉农，以便贯彻“早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的精神，领导群众及时彻底消灭棉蚜，保证棉花丰收。
    （二）不少地区因下种过早，或播种技术较差，发生了缺苗现象；这些地区必须抓紧时间，及时进行查苗，大力推行补种移植，保证全苗。
    （三）今年各地供应的化学肥料、豆饼等细肥，都较去年增加，这是保证棉花丰收的一个有利条件。各地区应根据当地实际情况，在棉株现蕾到开花期前，结合灌溉、整枝及当地雨水情况，实行分期施肥，克服过早、过晚或盲目一次大量施肥的偏向。
