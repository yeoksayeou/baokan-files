Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: According to a TASS report from Paris: Under the battle cries of "Oppose Fascism," "Strive for Peace," and "Strive for the Release of Duclos, Stil, and Other Patriots," the French Communist Party convened a mass rally at the Winter Velodrome in Paris on the evening of the 12th. Although the venue was heavily surrounded by a large contingent of military police, tens of thousands of Parisians enthusiastically came to participate, their hearts burning with the same demand: Immediately release the leader of the French people, Duclos!

When French Communist Party leaders Cachin, Marty, Garaudy, Vermeersch, Madame Duclos, Madame Stil, and trade union leader Frachon appeared on the platform, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. French National Assembly members Gotte and Meniai, Vice-President of the Council of the Republic of France Dabosset, famous writer Aragon, and other representatives of French democrats also took their seats on the platform.

Cachin, Marty, Garaudy, Vermeersch, and others spoke at the meeting, exposing the French ruling clique's policy of preparing for war, which obeyed the dictates of its American masters. They unanimously pointed out that this policy was inseparable from the following: American occupation of France, the fascization of France, increasingly lawless police, and the suppression of the working masses and the Communist Party, of all peace advocates and democrats. They called on all republicans and all French people to strengthen their unity, block the path of fascism, and strive for the release of Duclos, Stil, and other patriots. Their words were often interrupted by the audience's applause. Slogans such as "Release Duclos!" "No Fascism!" "Americans Get Out!" "Get Rid of Ridgway!" resounded throughout the venue from time to time. When Marty announced that the French people would never fight against the Soviet Union, the entire venue once again erupted in spring-thunder-like applause, and the audience enthusiastically shouted: "Long Live Stalin!"

Finally, the meeting unanimously passed a letter of respect to the Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Duclos, who is currently in prison. In the letter of respect, the meeting assured Duclos that the French people would certainly be able to win freedom for him and all other patriots, and would certainly be able to make the forces striving for peace and national independence in France victorious.

[This newspaper’s report] According to Xinhua News Agency: People from all walks of life in France are becoming increasingly involved in the movement to protest the French government's suppression of patriotic people and demand the release of Duclos. People in the French colonies of North Africa have also launched a movement demanding the release of Duclos.

According to "L'Humanité" news, Grenoble, Brive, Marseille, La Rochelle, Donzère-Mondragon, and other cities and villages in France have held new large-scale demonstrations to protest the fascist atrocities of the Pinay government. In Cannes, a People's Congress for the Defense of Peace was recently held, attended by four thousand delegates from various provinces of France. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution demanding the immediate release of Duclos and "L'Humanité" editor-in-chief Stil. Many progressive groups have continuously protested Duclos' arrest, including: the Executive Committee of the French Women's Union, the teachers and students of the Versailles Higher Education Institute, the Seine Provincial Committee of the Independent Teachers' Union, and the Municipal Committee of Pavillons-sous-Bois in the suburbs of Paris.

The Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, and the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party recently telegraphed the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, stating: We Communists resolutely protest the arrest of Duclos and Stil, and demand strengthened united struggle against the common enemy - the French colonial regime supported by American imperialism. The Madagascar Solidarity Movement Steering Committee wrote a letter to Duclos expressing its condolences.

    法共在巴黎举行群众大会要求释放杜克洛
    法国和北非人民继续抗议比内政府的暴行
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：在“反对法西斯主义”、“争取和平”、“争取释放杜克洛、斯梯及其他爱国者”的战斗口号下，法国共产党十二日晚上在巴黎冬季赛车场召集了群众大会。虽然会场被大队宪警重重包围，但是仍然有成千成万的巴黎人民踊跃前来参加，千万人的心中燃烧着同一个要求：立即释放法国人民领袖杜克洛！
    法国共产党领袖加香、马尔梯、葛约、维美徐、杜克洛夫人、斯梯夫人和总工会领袖佛拉商等在讲台上出现，全场顿时响起了雷鸣般的掌声。法国国民议会议员戈特和梅尼爱、法兰西联邦议会副议长达波赛、名作家阿拉贡和法国民主分子的其他代表，也在讲台上就席。
    加香、马尔梯、葛约和维美徐等在大会上讲话，揭穿了唯美国主子之命是听的法国统治集团的备战政策。他们一致指出：这种政策和下面一切是分不开的，那就是：美国占领法国，法国法西斯化，警察愈来愈无法无天，对劳动大众和共产党、对一切和平拥护者和民主分子实行镇压。他们号召全体共和分子和全体法国人民加强团结，来堵住法西斯主义的道路，争取释放杜克洛、斯梯和其他爱国者。他们的话常常被听众的掌声打断。“释放杜克洛！”“不准法西斯主义抬头！”“美国人滚出去！”“把李奇微赶出去！”的口号声，不时响遍全场。当马尔梯宣布法国人民决不对苏联作战时，全场再次响起了春雷般的掌声，会众热情地高呼：“斯大林万岁！”
    最后，大会一致通过了给现在狱中的法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛的致敬书。大会在致敬书里向杜克洛保证：法国人民一定能够使他及其他一切爱国者获得自由，并且一定能够使法国争取和平和民族独立的力量获得胜利。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：法国各阶层人民，越来越广泛地卷入了抗议法国政府镇压爱国人民和要求释放杜克洛的运动。北非各法国殖民地的人民也展开了要求释放杜克洛的运动。
    据“人道报”消息，格累诺布尔、布里夫、马赛、拉罗歇尔、东塞尔—孟德拉岗和法国其他城市与乡村，都举行了新的大规模示威游行，抗议比内政府的法西斯暴行。在戛纳市，最近举行了人民保卫和平大会，到会的有来自法国各省的四千名代表。会上一致通过决议，要求立刻释放杜克洛和“人道报”总编辑斯梯。许多进步团体不断抗议杜克洛的被捕，其中有：法兰西妇女联盟执行委员会，凡尔赛高等教育学院的师生，独立教师联合会塞纳省委员会，巴黎郊区巴维昂·苏布瓦区的市政委会等。
    突尼斯共产党中央委员会和阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会、摩洛哥共产党中央委员会最近打电报给法国共产党中央委员会表示：我们共产党人坚决抗议逮捕杜克洛和斯梯，并且要求加强对共同敌人——美帝国主义所支持的法国殖民政权——的联合斗争。马达加斯加声援运动指导委员会写信给杜克洛表示慰问。
