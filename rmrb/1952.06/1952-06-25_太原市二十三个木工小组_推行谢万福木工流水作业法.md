    Twenty-three Carpentry Groups in Taiyuan City
    Promote Xie Wanfu's Carpentry Assembly Line Method
    Comrade Editor: The twenty-three carpentry groups of the Materials Factory and the First Engineering Zone of the Taiyuan Engineering Office of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry began to promote Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method on June 1st, and work efficiency has significantly improved. In promoting Xie Wanfu's assembly line method, they first divided the groups according to each person's strengths and technical skills, with twelve people in each group; and rationally organized the labor force, changing the past method of individual operation, thus increasing work efficiency by more than double compared to before, while also ensuring quality and overcoming waste.
    The implementation of the assembly line method allows each person's work to be specialized, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. For example, Pan Xingen, a worker in the First Engineering Zone, created the "three-blade plane," which not only completes the five processes of marking, planing, cutting, beading, and chamfering required for making door and window frames at once, but also increases efficiency by more than four times. Liu Fuqing and Bai Ruyu, workers in groups ten and thirteen of the Materials Factory, improved the marking method, marking dozens of lines at a time, which not only increases work efficiency tenfold, but also makes the lines more regular than before.
    After the implementation of the assembly line method, skilled workers can be saved, and apprentices can be trained. In the past, a set of doors and windows required four workers, mostly first and second grade skilled workers; now a set of doors and windows only requires one and a half workers, with two-thirds being apprentices.
    Currently, all personnel of the Taiyuan Engineering Office Materials Factory and the First Engineering Zone are continuing to work hard to study and prepare to greet the Party's birthday with better achievements.

    太原市二十三个木工小组
    推行谢万福木工流水作业法
    编辑同志：中央重工业部基本建设局太原工程处材料厂和一工区的二十三个木工小组，六月一日开始推行谢万福木工流水作业法，工作效率显著提高。在推行谢万福流水作业法中，他们首先按每人特长和技术优劣划分小组，每小组十二人；并合理地组织了劳动力，改变过去的单独操作方法，因而工作效率较前提高一倍多，还保证了质量，克服了浪费现象。
    实行流水作业法，使每人工作都能专业化，大大发挥了工人们的积极性和创造性。如一工区工人潘新根创造的“三刃刨”，不但使做门窗架所需的划线、刨平、裁口、起线、倒棱五道过程，一下就作完了，效率还提高四倍多。材料厂十组和十三组工人刘福庆、白如玉改进的划线法，一划就是几十根线，不但工作效率提高十倍，而且划出来的线，比过去更规矩。
    实行流水作业法后，可以节省技工，又培养了徒工。过去一套门窗四个工，大部是一二等技工；现在一套门窗只需一个半工，有三分之二的徒工。
    现太原工程处材料厂和一工区全体人员，正继续努力钻研，准备以更好的成绩，迎接党的生日。
