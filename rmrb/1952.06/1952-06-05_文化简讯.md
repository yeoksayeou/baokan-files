Cultural News Briefs

    ▲ Wei Que, Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, officially announced at a general meeting of faculty, staff, and students of Fu Jen Catholic University on May 19 that all departments of Fu Jen Catholic University, except for the Departments of Sociology and Economics, and the specialized courses in Trade and Insurance, would be adjusted to merge with Beijing Normal University into a new normal university. The name Fu Jen Catholic University will be cancelled. The faculty, staff, and students of the university expressed their firm support for this wise measure of departmental adjustment that meets the needs of national construction. Many departments and faculty members have also pledged to resolutely obey the organizational assignments in thought and action and to strive for the educational cause of New China.
    ▲ The "Anhui Daily," the organ of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, was launched in Hefei on June 1. The newspaper is a daily broadsheet. In addition, Anhui People's Broadcasting Station was also established and began broadcasting on the same day.
    ▲ The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government recently established an agricultural college to cultivate high- and mid-level agricultural construction talents for the province and requested assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Many technicians from the Central Ministry of Agriculture and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, as well as teachers from Beijing Agricultural University, enthusiastically requested to participate in the work of the college. Under the principle of not affecting the work of the central ministry, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has temporarily approved eight people. They are all experts in crops, pest and disease control, forestry, and animal husbandry, and technicians with rich experience in these fields. They expressed their willingness to serve Xinjiang's agricultural construction for a long time.
    ▲ Zhou De-gong, a teacher at Chong Qing Girls' Middle School in Chong Qing County, Western Sichuan, successfully imitated a compound microscope using simple tools and materials and was commended by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee. This imitated microscope can magnify objects up to 600 or 700 times. Zhou De-gong is a biology and physical chemistry teacher at Chong Qing Girls' Middle School. Because the school did not have a microscope, students were not interested in his lectures. To overcome this difficulty, he decided to try to make a compound microscope. His plan received the support and help of the school's leading cadres and science teachers. With his continuous research and improvement, the first compound microscope was finally made. The tools and materials used to make this microscope are few, making it easy to promote its manufacture. Currently, some middle schools in Western Sichuan have manufactured a batch of microscopes according to Zhou De-gong's method, solving some of the difficulties in teaching equipment.
    ▲ The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province already has 75 ethnic primary schools, with more than 6,500 children enrolled, nearly three times more than the number of children enrolled at the beginning of liberation. Many poor students have received scholarships from the People's Government. The Autonomous Region People's Government has compiled and printed Tibetan textbooks for children and trained more than 50 Tibetan and Han primary school teachers.
    The Autonomous Region People's Government's active efforts to run schools have been supported and praised by people from all walks of life. Tibetan people in Danba and other counties in the region have done their utmost to assist in school construction. Ren Zhen Wangjia, a Tibetan from Yingguan Township, Kangding, voluntarily donated 20 dan of grain to repair the township's primary school buildings. To meet the ever-increasing cultural demands of the people of all ethnic groups, the Autonomous Region People's Government has decided to establish ten more ethnic primary schools this year.
