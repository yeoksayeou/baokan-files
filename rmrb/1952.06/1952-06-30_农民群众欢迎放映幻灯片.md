    Peasants Welcome Slide Shows
    In the past, the People's Cultural Center of Dayong County, Hunan Province, rarely combined slide show screenings with central tasks, often screening slides simply for the sake of screening slides. This January, we corrected this shortcoming and clearly recognized that slides should serve central tasks. We once made slides based on picture story books and screened them in rural areas of our county, which played a certain role in enlightening the peasants' class consciousness. This time, we screened slides 11 times in land reform areas and 7 times in areas where land reform had already been carried out, with an audience of 11,000 people. The second time we went to the countryside, we screened more than 30 times, with an audience of more than 18,000 people.
    We used to rarely screen slides in deep mountains and valleys. The places we went to this time were mostly deep mountains and valleys in the border areas of our county. Most of the peasants here had never been to the city, and they were very fond of slides. When we were screening in Ganzi Slope Village and Huanghe Village in the Fifth District, it was snowing heavily, but many peasants came to see the slides from places more than ten miles away, braving the wind and snow.
    Slide shows are very effective for propaganda in the countryside. We often use local materials and turn the moving deeds of the local area into slides and screen them locally, which has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. When Zhang Yuan of Xinmin Village in the Fourth District was building a pond dam, he worked very actively. He could carry more than 300 catties of stones every day from a considerable distance. After we made his story into a slide show, all the people building the pond dam the next day worked very actively. When we were in Maogang Village in the Sixth District, the peasants were preparing to struggle against the landlord Hu Runmin. We collected Hu Runmin's criminal facts from all aspects and made them into a slide show, which greatly encouraged the masses' struggle enthusiasm. Many peasants said: "We must defeat Hu Runmin."
    Although slide shows have a significant educational effect on peasants, some rural cadres do not pay enough attention to this propaganda work. When we arrived at Banping Village in the Fourth District, Tang Xuehuan, the leader of the land reform work team, emphasized that the masses did not like to watch slide shows; after we managed to screen the slide show "Why are Peasants so Poor" for the peasants, the peasants said, "This is better than holding ten meetings." The next day when we continued to screen, there were more than 500 people present, and some people who never participated in mass meetings came to watch. Comrade Tang Xuehuan also began to pay attention to slide shows.
    When screening slides, we also sold Chairman Mao's portraits and New Year pictures, and also taught the masses to sing.
    Since liberation, the peasants have loved to sing, especially young women and militiamen. They have a strong ability to learn music. They can sing a new song after learning it several times. They are most fond of local mountain songs and flower lantern lyrics. One of the comrades who went with us to screen slides could sing. Every time we went to a place, he taught the audience to sing before screening the slides, and the masses would sing as soon as they learned. After the slide show was over, they would gather around and ask us to copy the songs for them. Because the songs we taught were selected from the "Broadcast Song Selections," we incidentally promoted the "Broadcast Song Selections" for the Hunan People's Broadcasting Station for a total of 56 copies. A comrade who went with us brought a copy of flower lantern lyrics he had written himself, and the masses rushed to copy them every time we went to a place; a militiaman in Zhengjia Village in the Fifth District did not sleep all night in order to copy the flower lantern lyrics. The masses are so thirsty for culture. They also showed infinite love for the leader. The first slide was a portrait of Chairman Mao, and the masses clapped and cheered when they saw the portrait of Chairman Mao. The two hundred copies of Chairman Mao's portraits we brought were sold out in just a few villages. Zhenjia Village in the Fifth District is a very poor village, but the peasants here bought more than ninety portraits of Chairman Mao at once.

### 农民群众欢迎放映幻灯片

    农民群众欢迎放映幻灯片
    我们湖南大庸县人民文化馆，以往放映幻灯很少结合中心工作，往往是单纯为放映幻灯片而放映。今年一月我们纠正了这种缺点，明确认识幻灯应为中心工作服务。我们曾根据连环图制成幻灯片，到我县农村放映，对于启发农民阶级觉悟起了一定作用。这次我们在土地改革区放映幻灯片十一次，已经过土地改革区放映七次，观众达一万一千人。第二次下乡放映三十多次，有观众一万八千多人。
    我们从前放映幻灯片很少到大山深沟去，这两次我们所到的地方大都是我县边区的大山深沟。这里的农民多数没有进过城，他们对于幻灯非常爱好。当我们在五区柑子坡村、黄河村放映时，天正下着大雪，可是许多农民，都从十里以外的地方冒着风雪来看幻灯。
    幻灯片在乡下宣传很起作用。我们常常就地取材，把当地的动人事迹制成幻灯片在当地放映，这对于群众的生产情绪起了鼓舞作用。四区新民村张元在修筑塘坝时工作很积极，他从相当远的地方，每天能搬运三百多斤石头。我们把他的事情制成幻灯片放映后，第二天所有修筑塘坝的人都很积极地干起来了。我们在六区茅岗村时，农民正准备斗争地主胡润民，我们从各方面把胡润民的罪恶事实收集起来制成幻灯片放映，大大鼓舞了群众的斗争情绪，很多农民说：“我们一定斗垮胡润民。”
    幻灯片虽然对农民的教育作用不小，但有些农村的干部对这一宣传工作还不十分重视。我们到四区板坪村时，土地改革工作队队长唐学宦同志曾强调群众不爱看幻灯片；当我们设法给农民放映了“农民为何这样穷”的幻灯片后，农民们说：“这比开十次会还强。”第二天我们继续放映时，到场的观众有五百多人，有一些从来不参加群众会议的人都来看了。唐学宦同志对幻灯也重视起来了。
    在放映幻灯片时我们还附带推销毛主席像片、新年画，另外还教群众唱歌。
    解放以后农民群众都爱唱歌，尤其是年青的妇女和民兵，他们学习音乐的能力很强，一首新的歌曲，他们学几遍就能唱。他们对于本地的山歌、花灯词最爱好。我们同去放映幻灯片的一位同志会唱歌，每到一个地方，在没有放映幻灯片以前他就教观众唱歌，群众一唱就会。幻灯片放映过后，他们就围拢来要求我们给他们抄歌。因为我们教的歌是“广播歌选”上面选下来的，我们顺便为湖南人民广播电台推销“广播歌选”共五十六本。和我们同去的一位同志带了一本自己作的花灯词，每到一个地方群众都抢着抄；五区郑家村有一个民兵为了抄花灯词竟一夜没有睡觉。群众对于文化是这样如饥如渴的需要。他们对领袖也表现了无限热爱。幻灯片的第一张是放映毛主席的像片，群众看到毛主席的像片就拍手欢呼。我们带去的二百份毛主席像只在几个村子就卖光了。五区甄家村是个很穷的村子，可是这里的农民一次就买了九十多张毛主席像。
