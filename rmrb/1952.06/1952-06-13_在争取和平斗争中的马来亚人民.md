    The Malayan People in the Struggle for Peace
    Zeng Xuehong, Malayan Representative to the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    The six million people of Malaya warmly welcome and support the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. The Malayan people have always loved peace. They are working hard to fight for peace. Therefore, this meeting is of great significance to the Malayan people.
    Since the British colonial authorities launched a full-scale attack on the Malayan people in June 1948, the peaceful life of the Malayan people has been severely threatened and devastated. The crimes of the British colonialists in bloodily massacring the Malayan people are too numerous to mention. In the past four years, the British Air Force has dispatched more than 10,000 sorties, indiscriminately bombing civilian houses and destroying crops on a large scale, leaving many beautiful farmlands desolate, and large numbers of people displaced, without food or clothing. The British colonial authorities have also set up concentration camps throughout Malaya, detaining large numbers of innocent people. As of February this year, more than 26,500 people have been detained and then deported, and more than 5,000 people have been detained and have not yet been released, including 200 elderly people over the age of 60. Without exception, they have been subjected to insults, torture, and other various tortures by British military police. In rural areas, 400,000 farmers have been forced to leave their land and concentrate in more than 200 "new resettlement villages." Under the strict surveillance of the British military police, they have completely lost their freedom, and many have even been deprived of the right to work.
    The basic reason why the British colonial authorities so frantically suppress the Malayan people is to maintain and intensify their exploitation and plunder of the Malayan people. The rich rubber and tin produced by the hard work of the Malayan people are all plundered by the British. In 1951, Britain earned a net profit of more than 400 million U.S. dollars from the Malayan people, an increase of about one-sixth compared with 1950. However, the lives of the Malayan people have deteriorated sharply. For example, the cost of living index increased by 70 percent compared with the previous year; in Singapore alone, the total number of unemployed people reached 15 percent of the total number of workers. Not only that, but the Malayan people are also forced to bear the huge war expenses of the British colonial war in Malaya, which amounted to more than 300 million U.S. dollars in 1952, that is, an average of about 70 U.S. dollars per person, equivalent to 30 months of food expenses. The heavy oppression of the British colonial authorities has completely destroyed and deprived the Malayan people of the freedom to live and work in peace.
    The adventurous war of aggression waged by the United States in Korea and its frantic arms race policy are also a deep disaster for the Malayan people. For example, in April 1951, the British government succumbed to the U.S. and implemented the "embargo" against China, which resulted in a sharp drop in rubber prices, a significant reduction in rubber production in Malaya, a large number of workers lost their jobs, and the living standards of the people were further reduced.
    From their own personal experiences, the Malayan people deeply realize the importance of defending peace and striving for peace. The Malayan people have always unswervingly fought for peace. Even under extremely difficult conditions and the increasingly intensified rule of British white terror, the Malayan people still warmly responded to the resolutions of the World Peace Council. Especially after the Stockholm Appeal in March 1950, the Malayan people launched a peace signature campaign and achieved great results. In November 1951, the General Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army also declared its support for the resolutions of the Second Session of the World Peace Council, advocating a peaceful negotiation to resolve the war in Malaya on the principles of national self-determination and the withdrawal of foreign troops. In the future, the Malayan people will continue to work tirelessly with peace-loving people all over the world to oppose imperialist aggression and strive for lasting peace for mankind!

    在争取和平斗争中的马来亚人民
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议马来亚代表  曾雪虹
    马来亚六百多万人民热烈欢迎和拥护在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议。马来亚人民一向爱好和平。他们正为争取和平而努力奋斗。因此，这个会议对于马来亚人民是有莫大意义的。
    自从一九四八年六月英国殖民当局向马来亚人民实行全面的进攻以来，马来亚人民的和平生活就受到了严重威胁和摧残。英国殖民者血腥屠杀马来亚人民的罪行是罄竹难书的。四年来，英国空军曾经出动一万多架次，滥炸民房，大规模毁坏农作物，使得许多美好的田园荒芜了，广大人民流离失所，衣食无着。英国殖民当局并在马来亚各地遍设集中营，大批拘禁无辜人民。截至今年二月，被拘后复被驱逐出境者达二万六千五百余人，被拘而尚未获释者有五千余人，其中包括二百名六十岁以上的老年人。他们都毫无例外地受到英国军警的凌辱、拷打和其他各种毒刑。在乡村地区，已有四十万农民被迫离开他们的土地，分别集中于二百多个“移殖新村”内，他们在英国军警严密的监视下，完全丧失了自由，不少人甚至被剥夺了工作的权利。
    英国殖民当局所以这样疯狂地镇压马来亚人民，基本原因就是要维持并加紧它对马来亚人民的剥削和掠夺。马来亚人民辛苦生产出来的丰富的树胶和锡，全部给英国掠夺去了。一九五一年，英国从马来亚人民身上赚得纯利四亿多美元，较一九五○年约增加了六分之一。可是，马来亚人民的生活却急剧恶化。例如：生活指数较上一年增加百分之七十；仅在新加坡一地，全部失业人口即达工人总数的百分之十五。不但如此，马来亚人民还被迫担负着英国在马来亚所进行的殖民战争的巨额战费，一九五二年度约在三亿美元以上，即每人平均负担七十美元左右，相当于三十个月的粮食费。英国殖民当局的沉重压榨完全破坏了和剥夺了马来亚人民安居乐业和平生活的自由。
    美国在朝鲜所进行的冒险的侵略战争，以及它的疯狂的备战政策，对于马来亚人民来说，同样是一个深重的灾难。例如，一九五一年四月，英国政府屈从美国实施对华“禁运”的结果，就使得树胶价格暴跌，马来亚的树胶生产量大大减缩了，大批工人失业，人民的生活水平更加降低。
    马来亚人民从自己切身体验当中，深刻地认识到保卫和平、争取和平的重要意义。马来亚人民始终不渝地为和平而斗争，即使是在极端艰苦困难和英国白色恐怖统治日益加剧的条件下，马来亚人民仍然热烈地响应了世界和平理事会的各项决议。特别是一九五○年三月的斯德哥尔摩宣言发表以后，马来亚人民展开了和平签名运动，而且取得了巨大的成绩。一九五一年十一月，马来亚民族解放军总司令部又声明拥护世界和平理事会第二届会议的决议，主张在民族自决和撤退外国军队的原则下，以和平谈判的方式来解决马来亚的战争。今后，马来亚人民将继续不懈地和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为反对帝国主义侵略政策，争取人类持久和平而努力奋斗！
