Xinhua News Agency, 28th - According to TASS news: The provocative behavior of the U.S. aggressors in recently indiscriminately bombing non-military facilities such as the Yalu River power plants has aroused strong indignation among the people of Western European countries.

    The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement saying: "When the people of all countries are eagerly hoping for a ceasefire in Korea, the U.S. military authorities have launched the largest attack since the beginning of the war on the Yalu River power plants for no reason, which has greatly shocked British and world public opinion. This offensive is a brutal and crazy action deliberately taken by the bellicose U.S. ruling group to obstruct peace in the Far East and expand the war against China." The British Communist Party called on "all British people must immediately express their indignation and opposition, condemn the barbarous behavior of the Americans, demand that the British government not provide any support for the U.S. attack on the Yalu River, demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea, demand the immediate withdrawal of British troops, and not interfere in China."

    In France, after the bombing occurred, French Communist Party member of parliament Guyot questioned the government in the National Assembly, "What intentions does it have in this action and what responsibilities should it bear?" Guyot pointed out: "This bombing is an act of expanding the conflict and increasing the threat of a third world war." On the 26th, the Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a circular, pointing out that the U.S. barbaric bombing, which was purely provocative, made the French people very indignant, because they saw in this bombing the U.S. imperialism's attempt to ignite the flames of a third world war. The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor said: "The French working people fully support the Korean people who are fighting for their freedom and independence. The French working people demand an end to the war of aggression against Korea and demand the withdrawal of the troops sent by the French government to Korea. No French patriot would agree that our country participate in the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism that threaten world peace."

    Danish public opinion also firmly protested the barbaric bombing by the U.S. Air Force. The Danish branch of the Women's International Democratic Federation wrote to Danish Prime Minister Eriksen: "Mothers all over the world are paying close attention to the situation of the Korean armistice negotiations. They hope to establish peace in Korea to reduce the danger of a new world war. In the past two days, people have felt very indignant after hearing the news of the bombing of power plants in North Korea. Just when people were hoping to achieve peace in Korea, the power plants that guaranteed light and food for the suffering Korean people were destroyed. We demand that the Danish government immediately lodge a protest and condemn the actions that endanger the Korean peace talks. The Danish government should do its best to end the Korean War in order to express the will of all the Danish people."

    The Austrian Peace Committee, representing 810,000 Austrians who signed the declaration on the Five-Power Peace Pact, wrote an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, who was about to arrive in Vienna. It said: "We strongly protest against the bombing of the Yalu River power plants by U.S. aircraft. This rare act of destruction has aroused the infinite indignation of the Austrian people and the people of the world. At the beginning of the Korean armistice negotiations, hundreds of millions of people around the world had great hopes for an early ceasefire in Korea. But later they were very surprised to hear the facts that the United States used germ weapons and massacred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island. Now the provocative bombing of the Yalu River power plants, which are hundreds of kilometers away from the front line, has increased the worries of people of all countries, because this shows that the United States has no intention of peacefully resolving the Korean issue." The Austrian Peace Council solemnly warned: "Secretary of State Acheson, the Austrian people know that you are responsible for everything that is happening in Korea now. The negotiations to end the Korean War must be successfully concluded! Prisoners of war must be treated humanely in accordance with international law! The United States must ratify the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of germ weapons!"
Xinhua News Agency, 29th - TASS Delhi, 28th - The bombing of the Yalu River hydropower station by U.S. aircraft has greatly shocked Indian society. The "National Herald" wrote in an editorial titled "Aggression Against the Yalu River": The bombing of the Yalu River hydropower station "will be condemned by all peace-loving people as an unreasonable provocation. ... The bombing of the Yalu River hydropower station is more of a political action than a military action in its nature."

    The Bengali progressive newspaper "Freedom Daily" wrote in an editorial titled "Korea": "On the eve of the third year of the Korean War, the cowardly war-mongering bandits did not try to establish peace, but instead started a new bombing. They shamelessly destroyed the Yalu River hydropower station built by the labor of people's heroes. The actions of the criminals aroused the indignation of the people all over the world." The newspaper concluded: "We want to tell the U.S. government and its representatives in Delhi: India will never stand on the side of war criminals. India supports peace and stands on the side of freedom-loving countries. India supports Malik's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."
Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The U.S. aggressors frantically bombed the Yalu River power plants, non-military facilities in Korea, in an attempt to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations with so-called "military pressure." This serious provocative behavior not only did not scare the Korean and Chinese people, but instead caused a violent quarrel and panic within the aggression camp.

    When this serious provocative incident of the U.S. aggressors was reported, it had already caused "unease" in the Western European puppet countries of the United States, and the British ruling group was quarreling over it. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 25th: The bombing of the Yalu River hydropower plants has caused a "boiling political crisis" in Britain, "The Churchill government has been severely criticized in the House of Commons for the United Nations Command's large-scale bombing of the Yalu River coast in Korea," "The fate of the government is in turmoil." The policy of the U.S. aggressors to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and the British government's willingness to act as an accomplice to this policy of the United States had long been strongly opposed by the vast number of people in Britain, and many Labor MPs also stood up to question it. In order to deceive the people and cover up its shameless pursuit of the U.S. policy, the British government had to send Defense Minister Alexander to Japan, Korea and other places to visit in order to strive for so-called "greater voice." However, just as Alexander was returning from his visit, the U.S. government dared to launch a serious provocative incident of bombing the Yalu River hydropower plants, which aimed to undermine the armistice negotiations and expand the Korean War to threaten peace in Asia and the world. This crazy and sinful act of the U.S. aggressors aroused greater anger and opposition from the vast number of people in Britain. Under such circumstances of mass indignation, the British Labor Party had to postpone the original debate on the 24th and demanded that the House of Commons immediately hold an emergency debate on the U.S. bombing of the power plants on the 25th. Labor leader Attlee and former Labor government Defense Minister Shinwell and others questioned the Conservative government, asking Churchill whether this move by the United States "means a change in the policy of the United Nations." Attlee also expressed dissatisfaction with Alexander's endorsement of the bombing of the hydropower plants. Labor MP Bevan also said: "The government should be blamed for supporting this bombing, otherwise, Alexander should resign." (Agence France-Presse, London, 25th) According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 27th: The British Labor Party is actively brewing a "vote of no confidence" against Churchill "to oppose the Conservative government."

    At the same time, British bourgeois newspapers also published comments expressing fear and dissatisfaction. "The Manchester Guardian" said: "The destruction of these power plants not only looks like a change of policy, but also a very bad change." "The Daily Mail" said: This is "contrary to the policy adopted since the start of the armistice negotiations."

    Faced with this extremely unfavorable situation, the Churchill government hurriedly stated on the one hand that the U.S. bombing of the Yalu River hydropower plants "was not notified to the British government, nor was it consulted with the British," in an attempt to deceive the people, shirk responsibility, and use the rhetoric of "reserving the right to protest" to perfunctorily deal with the matter. On the other hand, it tried its best to defend the crimes of the U.S. aggressors, saying that "power stations are completely legitimate military targets." British Foreign Secretary Eden even shamelessly said: "Now, although we feel regret because we were not consulted, this decision has been implemented, and we should give our allies full support." (British Information Service, London, 25th)

    Here, the British Conservative government not only nakedly exposed that it was an accomplice in this new provocation by the United States, but also once again showed that this servile Wall Street lackey is still making every effort to support its American master's adventurous policy of aggression against Korea, determined to further act as an accomplice to the United States' attempt to break the negotiations and expand the war.

    西欧各国人民和印度“国民先驱报”等报
    反对美国滥炸鸭绿江发电厂暴行
    美国的挑衅行动引起侵略阵营内部恐慌
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社讯：美国侵略者近日滥炸鸭绿江发电厂等非军事设备的挑衅行为，已经在西欧各国人民间引起了强烈的愤慨。
    英国共产党政治委员会就此事发表声明说：“当各国人民都在殷切希望朝鲜停战的时候，美国军事当局竟对鸭绿江发电厂毫无理由地进行战争开始以来最大的一次袭击，使英国及全世界舆论大为震惊。这次进攻是好战的美国统治集团为了阻挠远东和平并扩大对中国的战争而处心积虑地采取的凶暴的疯狂行动。”英国共产党号召“全体英国人民必须立刻分头表示愤慨和反对，对于美国人的这种野蛮行为必须予以斥责，并要求英国政府对于美国袭击鸭绿江不要予以任何支持，要求立即在朝鲜停战，要求立即撤退英国军队，不许干涉中国。”
    在法国，当轰炸发生以后，法国共产党议员葛约就曾在国民议会中质问政府，它在这个行动上“抱有什么企图而且应负什么责任”。葛约指出：“这种轰炸是扩大冲突并增加第三次世界大战威胁的行为。”二十六日，法国总工会执行局发出通告，指出美国这种纯属挑衅的野蛮轰炸使法国人民非常愤慨，因为他们在这种轰炸中看到了美国帝国主义想燃起第三次世界大战火焰的企图。法国总工会执行局说：“法国劳动人民全力声援为自己的自由和独立而战斗的朝鲜人民。法国劳动人民要求停止侵朝战争，并要求撤回法国政府派到朝鲜去的军队。没有一个法国爱国者会同意我们的国家参与美帝国主义使世界和平遭到威胁的挑衅行动。”
    丹麦舆论界也坚决抗议美国空军的野蛮轰炸。国际民主妇女联合会丹麦分会致书丹麦首相伊里克逊说：“全世界的母亲都非常注意朝鲜停战谈判的情形。她们希望在朝鲜建立和平以减少爆发新世界大战的危险。这两天，人们听到轰炸北朝鲜发电厂的消息以后，都感到非常愤慨。正当人民希望在朝鲜获得和平的时候，给备受苦难的朝鲜人民保证光亮和食物的发电厂被破坏了。我们要求丹麦政府立即提出抗议，并谴责使朝鲜和谈遭到危险的行动。丹麦政府应尽全力来结束朝鲜战争，才能表达全体丹麦人民的意志。”
    奥地利和平委员会代表曾在五大国和平公约宣言上签了名的八十一万奥地利人民，给即将到维也纳来的美国国务卿艾奇逊写了一封公开信。其中说：“我们对美国飞机轰炸鸭绿江发电厂一举提出坚决的抗议。这种罕见的破坏行动引起了奥地利人民及全世界人民的无限愤慨。在朝鲜停战谈判开始时，全世界亿万人民对朝鲜早日实现停火抱着很大的希望。但后来他们却非常惊讶地听到了美国使用细菌武器、虐杀巨济岛上朝中战俘的事实。现在对离前线数百公里远的鸭绿江发电厂进行的挑衅轰炸，增加了各国人民的忧虑，因为这表示美国无意和平解决朝鲜问题。”奥地利和平理事会郑重提出警告说：“国务卿艾奇逊先生，奥地利人民知道，现在在朝鲜所发生的一切，应由你负责。结束朝鲜战争的谈判必须胜利结束！必须根据国际法对战俘施以人道待遇！美国必须批准关于禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书！”
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社德里二十八日讯：美国飞机滥炸鸭绿江水电站一事使印度社会大为震惊。“国民先驱报”在以“对鸭绿江的侵略”为题的社论中写道：轰炸鸭绿江水电站一举，“将被一切爱好和平的人谴责为毫无道理的挑衅。……轰炸鸭绿江水电站一事就其性质来说，政治行动大于军事行动”。
    孟加拉文进步报纸“自由报”在以“朝鲜”为题的社论中写道：“在朝鲜战争第三年开始的前夕，懦怯的战争贩子匪帮不设法建立和平，却反而开始新的轰炸。他们无耻地破坏了人民英雄的劳动所建造的鸭绿江水电站。罪犯们的行动引起了全世界人民的愤慨。”该报在结尾写道：“我们要告诉美国政府及其在德里的代表：印度决不站在战犯的一边。印度拥护和平，站在爱好自由的国家的一边。印度拥护马立克主张和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国侵略者疯狂轰炸朝鲜非军事设备鸭绿江发电厂，妄图以所谓“军事压力”来拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判。这一严重的挑衅行为不仅没有吓倒朝中人民，反而在侵略阵营内部引起了一片剧烈的争吵与恐慌。
    当美国侵略者这一严重的挑衅事件传出后，已在美国的西欧仆从国家中引起了“惶惶不安”，英国统治集团内部并正为此吵成一团。据合众社伦敦二十五日电称：轰炸鸭绿江水电厂已在英国引起了“沸腾的政治危机”，“邱吉尔政府在下院中因联合国军司令部对朝鲜鸭绿江沿岸进行大规模轰炸而遭到严厉的抨击”，“政府的命运正在动荡不定”中。 美国侵略者拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的政策和英国政府甘愿充当美国这一政策的帮凶，早已受到英国广大人民的强烈反对，许多工党议员也起而提出质问。英国政府为了欺骗人民并掩饰它无耻地追随美国的政策，曾不得不派遣国防大臣亚历山大到日本、朝鲜等地访问，以争取所谓“比较大的发言权”。但是，就在亚历山大访问归来的时候，美国政府却胆敢发动了旨在破坏停战谈判，并扩大朝鲜战争以威胁亚洲及世界和平的，轰炸鸭绿江水电厂的严重挑衅事件。美国侵略者这一疯狂罪恶行动，引起了英国广大人民更大的愤怒和反对。在这种群情愤激的情况下，英国工党于二十四日不得不搁置了原定的辩论，要求下院在二十五日立即就美国轰炸发电厂一事进行紧急辩论。工党领袖艾德礼和前工党政府国防大臣辛威尔等纷纷向保守党政府提出质问，要求邱吉尔说明美国此举是否“意味着联合国的政策有所改变”。艾德礼并对亚历山大对轰炸水电厂一事发表附和言论表示不满。工党议员比万也说：“政府因为支持这个轰炸应全体受到责备，要不然，亚历山大应该辞职。”（法新社伦敦二十五日电）据合众社伦敦二十七日电透露：英国工党正在积极酝酿对邱吉尔提出“不信任案”，“以反对保守党政府”。
    与此同时，英国资产阶级报纸也纷纷发表评论，表示恐惧和不满。“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“破坏这些电力厂不但看起来是政策改变，而且还是一个很坏的改变。”“每日邮报”说：这是“违背停战谈判开始以来所采取的方针”。
    邱吉尔政府面对着这一极为不利的形势，一方面慌忙声明：美国轰炸鸭绿江水电厂“并没有通知英国政府，也没有与英国磋商”，企图欺骗人民，推脱责任，并以“保留抗议权利”的鬼话进行搪塞。但另一方面，它又千方百计地为美国侵略者的罪行辩护，说什么“电力站是完全合法的军事目标。”英国外交大臣艾登甚至无耻地说：“现在，我们虽因未与我们磋商而感觉遗憾，但是这个决定已经执行了，我们就应该对我们的盟国予以充分的支持。”（英国新闻处伦敦二十五日电）
    英国保守党政府在这里不但赤裸裸地暴露了它是参加美国这次新挑衅的同谋犯，同时也再次表明了这个奴颜婢膝的华尔街小伙计，依然在竭力支持它的美国主子的侵略朝鲜的冒险政策，决心进一步充当美国企图破裂谈判和扩大战争的帮凶。
