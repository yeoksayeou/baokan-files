Letters to the Editor Digest

    It is necessary to organize demobilized soldiers in rural areas to conduct propaganda and education work among the masses
    Currently, there are some soldiers throughout the country who have been demobilized from the Volunteer Army or the People's Liberation Army and have returned to their hometowns to engage in production. They have been tempered by revolutionary struggle, have a high degree of political consciousness, and are rich in practical experience in struggle. Their deeds of struggle are vivid and practical educational materials for the masses. For example, comrades Wang Jichen and Zhao Shuiqi of Huoxiangdao Village, Third District, Licheng County, recently returned home from the Volunteer Army to engage in production. They often publicize the situation of Resisting America and Aiding Korea to the masses in their village, which greatly improved the political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses.
    It is hoped that relevant authorities in various places will pay attention to these comrades, organize them, give full play to their strength, and educate the broad masses of peasants.

    The leave system of Chengzi Coal Mine in Western Beijing is unreasonable
    The leave system of Chengzi Coal Mine in the Western Beijing Mining Area is very unreasonable. Workers must go through at least seven procedures to apply for leave: group discussion, signature of the squad leader, seal of the group leader, approval of the pit leader and the trade union, inspection by the health team, approval by the personnel section, and registration by the coal mining section. Therefore, it is impossible to get a one-day leave processed in one day.
    Section Chief Zhou of the mine's personnel section has a very bad attitude towards the workers. When workers take the health team's examination certificate to ask him for approval, he always says that the workers are not sick. When workers show him their wounds, he says: "What's this little injury? I used to work even when my flesh was torn." Sometimes he scolds workers who ask for sick leave for two hours, and still does not approve the leave, or arbitrarily reduces the number of days of leave approved by the doctor.
    Due to the above situation, some workers' conditions or injuries have become more serious, and they are still unable to ask for leave; some workers are afraid of trouble and simply do not ask for leave. Therefore, the attendance rate of workers fluctuates, which affects production. I suggest that the leaders of the mine quickly check and correct this unreasonable system.

    Actors of the Central Academy of Drama's Affiliated Opera and Dance Theater request the academy to set up a nursery
    We are actors of the Central Academy of Drama's Affiliated Opera and Dance Theater and often have to do heavy performance work. However, we all have children who need care, which has become a great burden for us, making it impossible for us to work better. For two years, we have repeatedly suggested that the academy organize a nursery. Although the academy has expressed its agreement, it is not concerned about this issue in practice. They always emphasize difficulties and have not done it. A few months ago, the academy decided to prepare for the establishment of a nursery. After the enthusiastic efforts of the comrades, everything is ready, only lacking a cadre responsible for the work of the nursery. However, the administration is not helping to solve this problem, and it seems that the nursery will not be established again.
    Currently, there are more than ninety children under the age of five in our academy. In order to better educate children and take care of the work and health of mothers, it is absolutely necessary to establish a nursery. We suggest that the academy pay attention to this issue, change its past passive attitude, and establish a nursery as soon as possible.

    来信摘要
    应该组织在农村的复员军人向群众进行宣传教育工作
    目前全国各地农村都有一些从志愿军或解放军中复员回乡生产的军人。他们受过革命斗争的锻炼，政治觉悟很高，实际斗争经验也很丰富。他们的斗争事迹对群众是生动而实际的教育材料。如黎城县三区火巷道村王既辰、赵水奇两同志，最近由志愿军复员回家生产，他们经常向本村群众宣传抗美援朝的情况，大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情。
    希望各地有关机关重视这些同志，把他们组织起来，充分发挥他们的力量，教育广大农民群众。

    京西城子煤矿请假制度不合理
    京西矿区城子煤矿的请假制度很不合理。工人请假至少要经过七道手续：小组讨论，班长签字，组长盖章，坑长及工会批准，卫生组检查，人事股批准，采煤股登记。因此，请一次假一天也跑不过来。
    该矿人事股周股长，对工人态度很不好，工人拿着卫生组的检验证请他批准时，他总说工人没病。工人把伤口给他看，他说：“这点伤算什么？我过去肉碰烂了，还照样干活。”有时他把请病假的工人训斥两个钟头，结果还是不准请假，或者任意减少医生已批准的休假天数。
    由于以上情况，有些工人的病情或伤势已经较重，还无法请假；有的工人怕麻烦，就干脆不请假。因此工人出勤率忽高忽低，影响生产。我建议该矿领导方面赶快检查、纠正这种不合理的制度。

    中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院演员要求院方设立托儿所
    我们是中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院的演员，经常要做繁重的演出工作。但是我们都有孩子需要照顾，这成了我们很大的负担，使我们不能更好的工作。两年来，我们曾多次建议院方组织托儿所。院方虽然也曾表示同意，但实际上对这个问题并不关心，他们总是强调困难，一直没办。数月前院方又决定要筹办托儿所，经过同志们热心设法，现在什么都筹备好了，只缺一个负责托儿所工作的干部。但行政上对这个问题却不协助解决，眼看托儿所又要办不起来了。
    现在我院五岁以下的儿童有九十多人。为了更好地教育儿童，照顾母亲们的工作和健康，成立托儿所是完全必要的。我们建议院方重视这个问题，改变过去的消极态度，赶快成立托儿所。
