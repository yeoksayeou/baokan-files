Construction sites in Lüshun City have universally launched a movement to "tap potential, find tricks, and transform tools." To date, construction workers throughout the city have created and improved more than 50 new tools and proposed more than ten rationalization proposals of significant value for improving production. These creations and improvements have made a tremendous contribution to the construction industry.

Lu Baochun, a plastering worker with more than 20 years of experience, under the education and cultivation of the Party, and after painstaking research, created the "floor-smoothing tractor." After initial trial use, this machine increased work efficiency by 235 percent and improved project quality by 30 percent. This new tool has a very simple structure and many advantages:

First, it simplifies the operation process and improves work efficiency. In the past, this operation required five steps, wasting a lot of time when changing tools, and at most, 60 square meters could be plastered in a day. When using the new tool, only one drag and one press are needed, with only two steps. Eleven square meters can be plastered in 20 minutes, and work efficiency is increased by 235 percent compared to the past.

Second, project quality is significantly improved. In the past, plastering with a small trowel required very little pressure, and the plastered floor was neither solid nor flat. After the house was built, the wrinkles from the trowel remained on the ground for a long time. When using the new tool for plastering, the pressure is very heavy, and the plastered floor is firm and smooth. People who have visited have said, "It's like a mirror, without any wrinkles!"

Third, the operation is simplified, making it easy for apprentices to master the technology. In the past, it was not easy for apprentices to master the complex plastering operations. Ordinary apprentices could not plaster floors at all without two to three years of training. With the new tool, the master only needs to lay down the crossbar, and the apprentice can do well after three days of learning.

Fourth, it reduces worker fatigue. In the past, plasterers had to squat on the ground to work, and after a day's work, their backs ached and their legs were numb. Now, they hold a handle more than one meter long with both hands and stand to plaster, which is light and labor-saving.

Lu Baochun's creation has attracted great attention from construction workers throughout the city. They are learning from Lu Baochun's spirit of reforming tools, and many new reforms and creations have emerged among carpenters, bricklayers, and painters. Wu Shuqin's carpentry team has created and transformed eight new types of tools, such as line-marking planes and double saws; Qu Yongliang's team has improved eight tools, such as sloping-edge trimming planes; bricklayers Jiang Xueming, Cao Zhenfa, and Fan Chunxi, and painters Shan Liming and Zhou Lianshun's teams have also created a large number of new tools. These creations have played a significant role in improving current production methods in the construction industry. For example, in the past, carpenters had to go through four or five steps to plane the edges of floors and door and window frames, resulting in low work efficiency; with the new line-marking plane, only one step is needed to complete everything. Qu Yongliang's team cleverly applied the multi-blade method of the mechanical industry, adding several blades to the original single-blade plane, creating the sloping-edge trimming plane, reducing the work from four steps to one step. In the past, painters had to use ladders to paint walls and ceilings, and use manual alignment for wall skirts; now, after using the new long-handled brushes and automatic alignment paint rollers, work efficiency has doubled. These creations have not only greatly improved work efficiency, but also solved the difficulty of lacking skilled workers. Ordinary apprentices can do the work of master craftsmen after two or three months of learning.

In April, after construction sites initially used these new tools and operating methods, work efficiency and project quality were greatly improved, and tasks were generally completed ahead of schedule. For example, Sui Changxu's team completed 40 days of work in 21 days, and also saved 3.48 million yuan in material costs.

The achievements of construction workers in Lüshun City are inseparable from the leadership and cultivation of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. After advanced working methods of Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, and Yang Dezong appeared in the Northeast, the leadership devoted great energy to organizing workers to learn and promote these working methods. First, a group of workers was transferred to the Northeast Workers' Political University to study. After these workers returned from their studies, they served as the backbone to promote and popularize advanced experiences among construction workers. At the beginning, many workers were very conservative in their thinking and looked down on advanced experience. The leadership concentrated its efforts to strengthen class education, guiding workers to recognize their status as masters in the new country and the significant relationship between their work and national construction and the socialist future. This opened up the minds of most construction workers. Lu Baochun, a worker, used to think, "There is no future in being a plasterer." After education, his views changed. He said, "The country needs us now, and we must ensure the completion of the glorious tasks assigned to us by the country." Since then, he has often considered how to improve the efficiency of floor plastering. After studying the advanced working methods of Su Changyou, Yang Dezong, and others, he realized that to improve work efficiency, it was necessary to reform the existing backward tools and production methods. After painstaking research, he drew a diagram of the "floor-smoothing tractor." On the one hand, he tested the rationality of the tool's structure in practical work; on the other hand, he pasted the diagram on the wall of the kang (platform bed) and studied it repeatedly every night when he came back. In the process of researching this tool, he averaged only two or three hours of sleep each night. After overcoming various difficulties, his plastering tractor was successfully tested. After this, the leadership further launched a movement to "tap potential, find tricks, and transform tools" among the workers. In the movement, new methods and tricks were discovered, and they were promptly commended and encouraged. Operation performances were held in a prepared manner, and worker forums were organized to make "tapping potential, finding tricks, and transforming tools" a mass movement.

    旅顺市各建筑工地
    开展挖潜力找窍门改造工具运动
    卢保存创造“抹地拖拉机”，提高效率百分之二百卅五
    旅顺市各建筑工地普遍掀起“挖潜力找窍门改造工具”的运动。到现在为止，全市建筑工人已经创造和改进了新工具五十多件，提出对改进生产有重要价值的合理化建议十多件。这些创造和改进，对于建筑业有着巨大的贡献。有二十多年工龄的抹灰工人卢保存，在党的教育和培养下，经过苦心研究，创造出“抹地拖拉机”。这个机器经初步试用，提高了工作效率百分之二百三十五，提高了工程质量百分之三十。这一新式工具，构造很简单，有许多优点：一、简化了操作过程，提高了工作效率。过去，这种操作需要经过五道工序，在调换工具时浪费很多时间，一天最多能抹灰六十平方公尺。使用新工具时，只要拖一遍、压一遍，用两道工序就行，二十分钟就能抹灰十一平方公尺，工作效率较过去提高百分之二百三十五。二、工程质量显著提高。过去用小泥板抹灰，压力很轻，抹出的地，既不实又不平，房子盖好以后，地上长久留着泥板的皱纹。使用新工具抹灰，压力很重，抹出的地坚实、光滑，参观过的人都说：“好像一面镜子，一点皱纹都没有！”三、操作简单化了，便于徒工掌握技术。过去徒工不容易掌握抹灰的复杂操作，一般的徒工没有两年到三年的时间，根本不能抹地。用新工具，老师傅只需把横杆铺上，徒工经三天的学习，就可以做得很好。四、减少了工人的疲劳。过去抹灰工人都是蹲在地上工作，做一天活累得腰酸腿麻。现在双手扶着长约一公尺以上的把手，站着抹灰，轻便省力。卢保存的这一创造，引起了全市建筑工人的极大注意。他们学习卢保存改革工具的精神，在木工、瓦工、油工中，都有许多新的改革和创造。木工吴树勤小组现已创造、改造了采线刨子、双条锯等新式工具八种；曲永良组改进了坡楞采口刨子等八种工具；瓦工姜学明、曹振发、范春秀，油工单立明、周连顺等组也都创造了大量的新式工具。这些创造对于改进目前建筑工业中的生产方法，发挥了很大的作用。如木工过去刨地板边和门、窗框脸等，都有四、五道工序，工作效率很低；有了新式工具采线刨子以后，只用一道工序，就可全部完成。曲永良组在工作中巧妙地运用了机械工业多刀多刃法，在原来一个刀口的刨子上添了好几个刀口，创造了坡楞采口刨子，过去四道工序的活，现在也减到一道工序。油工过去刷墙壁、天棚都要搭梯子，刷墙围用人工齐线；现在改用了新式长把刷子和自动齐线油滚后，工作效率较前增加了一倍。这些创造不但大大地提高了工作效率，而且解决了缺乏技术工人的困难，普通的徒工经过两三个月学习后，就能做老师傅做的活。四月份，各建筑工地初步运用了这些新的工具和操作方法后，工作效率和工程质量大为提高，普遍提前完成了任务。如隋长绪组二十一天完成了四十天的任务，还节省了三百四十八万元的材料费。
    旅顺市建筑工人取得这样的成就，是和党、行政、工会、青年团的领导和培养分不开的。当东北陆续出现了苏长有、谢万福、杨德重等先进工作方法以后，领导方面就以极大的精力组织工人学习和推广这些工作方法。首先抽调了一部分工人到东北工人政治大学学习。这些工人学习回来以后，作为骨干在建筑工人中宣传和推广先进经验。开始时，很多工人思想很保守，瞧不起先进经验。领导方面集中力量加强阶级教育，引导工人认识自己在新国家中的主人翁地位和自己的工作对国家建设和社会主义前途的重大关系。这就打通了大部建筑工人的思想，工人卢保存过去总是认为：“干抹灰匠没出息”。经过教育以后，他的看法变了，他说：“国家正需要我们，我们一定要保证完成国家交给我们的光荣任务。”从此，他就经常考虑怎样把抹地的效率提高一步。他研究了苏长有、杨德重等的先进工作方法后，认识到要提高工作效率必须改革现有的落后的工具和生产方法。经过刻苦钻研，他绘出“抹地拖拉机”的图样。他一方面在实际工作中试验工具的构造是否合理，一方面把图样贴在炕头的墙壁上，每天晚上回来，在炕上瞅着图样一再研究。在研究这个工具的过程中，他每天晚上平均只能睡两、三个钟头。克服种种困难后，他的抹灰拖拉机试验成功了。在这以后，领导方面即进一步在工人中发动了“挖潜力找窍门改造工具”的运动，在运动中发现了新的方法和窍门，就及时表扬鼓励，有准备地举行操作表演，组织工人座谈，使“挖潜力找窍门改造工具”形成群众运动。
