Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Full Line Completes Track Laying and Bridge and Tunnel Engineering
Workers Create New Records to Strive for "July 1st" Opening

    The employees of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau are striving to open the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on July 1st as a gift for the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The track laying, bridge, and tunnel engineering of the entire line have now been completed.

    After the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau issued the call in mid-March to "Strive for the full line opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on 'July 1st'," workers have continuously created new records. The Baishuao Tunnel in the Chengdu Engineering Section is the longest tunnel on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The workers constructing this tunnel launched a production competition to strive for the "July 1st" opening and improved work efficiency. In the past, when repairing the east entrance invert, they could only repair 2.5 meters per day and night, but now they can repair 4 meters. In the past, when repairing the west entrance invert, they could only repair 4 meters per day and night, but now they can repair 6 meters, creating the highest record for tunnel invert excavation on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This tunnel was completed on May 15th. The track-laying workers created the "side-pulling and straight-laying" operation method, saving time and manpower. On April 29th, they completed 5 kilometers and 305 meters of track laying in one day, creating a new record. Most of the locomotives used on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are old, but the crew members put forward the slogan "Don't be afraid of old locomotives, as long as they are well maintained, they can pull more and run faster," and launched an over-axle movement, providing the necessary steel rails and sleepers for the track-laying project in a timely manner. Workers in the locomotive section repair group reduced the cost of locomotive repairs. The cost of locomotive repairs is now half of what it was in March of this year. When fitter Li Kunming and Chen Fahou of the rolling stock section repair shop made cotter pins, they created the "scissor machine" and "opening press machine," increasing production efficiency by 14 times. Previously, it took five minutes to make one cotter pin; now it only takes one minute to make three cotter pins.

    On April 22nd, the Chongqing Provisional Machinery Factory received the production task of making 52 sets of turnouts by the end of May. In the past, the factory's employees had never made turnouts. When they made the first set of turnouts, it took them twelve days. The factory director was very anxious: "If it takes so long to make one set of turnouts, how can we complete the task?" The comrade responsible for the factory's Party organization consulted with skilled workers and unanimously believed that in order to complete the task, it was necessary to improve labor organization and change the work system. The comrade responsible for the factory's Party organization put forward this suggestion to the administrative side. The administrative cadres accepted the Party's suggestion and changed the past unreasonable phenomena in production. For example, there were too few planing machine workers, so the leading cadres transferred a batch of lathe workers and handymen to do the work of planing machines. These workers quickly became skilled planing machine workers. Due to these reforms, the Chongqing Provisional Machinery Factory finally completed the task of 52 sets of turnouts on May 26th, 116 hours ahead of schedule. (Wei Fan)

    成渝铁路全线完成铺轨及桥梁、隧道工程
    工人们纷纷创造新纪录争取“七一”通车
    西南铁路工程局的职工们争取在七月一日修通成渝铁路，作为给中国共产党三十一周年诞辰的献礼。现在全线的铺轨、桥梁和隧道工程已经完成。
    今年三月中旬，西南铁路工程局发出了“争取成渝路‘七一’全线通车”的号召以后，工人们不断地创造新纪录。成都工务段柏树坳隧道是成渝铁路上最长的一座隧道。修筑这个隧道的工人们，开展了争取“七一”通车的生产竞赛，提高了工作效率。过去修东口卧底工程时，每昼夜只能修到二点五公尺，现在能修到四公尺；过去修西口卧底工程时，每昼夜只能修到四公尺，现在能修到六公尺，创造了成渝铁路的隧道挖底工程的最高纪录。这座隧道已经在五月十五日全部完工。铺轨工人创造了“侧拉正放”的操作方法，节省了时间和人力，在四月二十九日一天内，做了五公里三百零五公尺长的铺轨工程，创造了新纪录。在成渝铁路上运用的机车大多是老机车，但乘务员提出了“不怕机车老，只要保养好，一样多拉，一样快跑”的口号，展开了超轴运动，及时地供应了铺轨工程所需用的钢轨和枕木。机务段检修组的工人们降低了检修机车成本。现在检修机车的成本，已经比今年三月减少了一半。车辆段修理场钳工李昆明和陈发厚做开口销时，创造了“剪刀机”和“压开口机”，把生产效率提高十四倍。以前做一个开口销，需要五分钟；现在做三个开口销，只要一分钟。
    四月二十二日，重庆临时机厂接到了在五月底必须做好五十二付道岔的生产任务。过去，这个工厂的职工没有做过道岔，他们做第一付道岔时，花了十二天的时间。厂长很着急：“一付道岔就做了这么久，怎么能完成任务？”这个厂的党组织的负责同志找熟练工人商量，一致认为要想完成任务，必须改善劳动组织，改变工作制度。这个厂的党组织的负责同志就把这个意见向行政方面提了出来。行政干部接受了党的建议，改变了过去生产上不合理的现象。比如刨床工人太少，领导干部就调了一批镟工和杂工去干刨床的活。这批工人很快就成了熟练的刨床工人。由于这些改革，重庆临时机厂终于在五月二十六日，提前一百一十六小时完成了五十二付道岔的任务。（魏凡）
