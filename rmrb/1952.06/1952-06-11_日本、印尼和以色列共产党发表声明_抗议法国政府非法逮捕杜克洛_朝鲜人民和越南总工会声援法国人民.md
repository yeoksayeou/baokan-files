Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: TASS Tokyo, June 9th: According to "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper reports: The leadership organ of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement protesting the arrest of Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.

The statement pointed out that the illegal arrest of Duclos is related to the Western countries' conclusion of a unilateral military treaty with Adenauer and West Germany's participation in the European military alliance, which is another step in preparation for another war.

The leadership organ of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the atrocity of arresting Duclos and the Japanese government's anti-people bill – the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" – are two completely identical links in the chain of the American aggressive policy. Finally, the leadership organ of the Japanese Communist Party called on Japanese workers to organize a protest movement to protest the arrest of Duclos.

Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: Jakarta News: The Indonesian Communist Party has sent a telegram to the French Communist Party, warmly supporting the heroic struggle of the French Communist Party and the French people to defend peace and strive for French independence. The telegram stated that the Indonesian people are extremely indignant at the fascist atrocity of the French government, under the direction of American imperialism, in arresting Duclos, the Secretary of the French Communist Party. At the same time, the Indonesian Communist Party has submitted a protest letter to the French government to the French Embassy in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: Tel Aviv News: The Israeli Communist Party Congress, held in Tel Aviv from May 29th to 31st, passed a resolution demanding the immediate release of Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th: Korean newspapers and people from all walks of life unanimously protested against the French reactionary government's illegal arrest of French Communist leader Duclos and other patriots, and demanded that the French government release them immediately.

"Rodong Sinmun" (Workers' Newspaper) published an editorial on the 8th, stating: The French reactionary authorities' barbaric measures to arrest French Communist leader Duclos and other French patriots were carried out under the direction of American imperialists. This increasingly obvious fascist policy of the French government has aroused great anger from the French people and the people of the world. The editorial said: The Korean people, who are resisting the bloody aggression of American imperialism, express fraternal solidarity with the French people who are bravely opposing the butcher Ridgway extending his claws to Europe. The Korean people resolutely demand that the French government immediately release Duclos and other arrested French patriots. We are convinced that the growing strength of peace forces and the increasingly fervent protests of people from all countries will surely stop the illegal actions of the reactionaries.

In recent days, people from all walks of life in Korea have gathered to protest the barbaric measures of the French reactionary government. Worker Li Yuanji of a factory said at a protest meeting: American imperialism, which is attempting to provoke a new war, is instigating its French lackeys to openly suppress the patriotic movement of the French people. However, just as the American beasts have suffered a disastrous defeat in the Korean war of aggression, their conspiracy in France will also be bankrupted in the face of the heroic struggle of the French people. For the independence of the motherland and world peace, we are determined to more forcefully strike at the American aggressors and actively support the just struggle of the French people. Farmers in Meishan-ri, Xiqu District, Pyongyang City, also held a protest meeting on the evening of the 6th. The farmers who attended the meeting all expressed their willingness to support the front line with more grain production to defeat the American aggressors through practical actions and strong protests to support the French people. All the employees of the Central Bank of Pyongyang City passed a protest letter at the protest meeting, expressing that they would never allow the conspiracy of American imperialism to provoke a new war in Western Europe to succeed, together with the kind people of the world, and resolutely demanded that the French reactionary authorities immediately release Duclos and other French patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: According to the Vietnam News Agency: Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, sent a telegram to Fralachon, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, to support the struggle of the French working people to defend peace and to protest the French government's illegal arrest of French people's leader Duclos and the atrocities of persecuting French patriots. The telegram stated: The Vietnamese working people are extremely indignant upon learning that the French reactionary rulers have actually arrested Comrade Duclos and many French patriotic volunteers under the orders of American imperialism. The Vietnamese people strongly protest this fascist act by the French reactionaries, the running dogs of American imperialism, who are pushing France and the French people into war. The telegram pointed out: The illegal acts of the French reactionary rulers in suppressing the French people and arresting Duclos can only more clearly illustrate the fear of the French reactionaries and American imperialists for the French workers' and French people's struggle to defend peace and for the great prestige of the French Communist Party. The telegram said: The Vietnamese working people wholeheartedly support the increasingly strong struggle of the French workers and the French people to defend the independence of their motherland and to defend world peace. We resolutely demand the immediate release of Comrade Duclos, one of the most respected leaders of the French workers and the French people and a dear friend of the Vietnamese workers and the Vietnamese people.
