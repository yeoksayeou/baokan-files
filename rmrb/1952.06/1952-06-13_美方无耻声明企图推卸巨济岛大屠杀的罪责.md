Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 12th: After the American aggressors carried out a bloody massacre of our captured personnel in Camp 76 on Geoje Island, they are now trying to shirk responsibility while continuing to cruelly persecute our captured personnel in other camps.

Following the massacre, the American executioner Boatner and the U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters issued extremely shameless statements and communiques on the 10th and 11th, attempting to shirk the serious responsibility for the massacre of our captured personnel and cover up the truth of the matter. Boatner admitted that the known number of our captured personnel killed and wounded had reached 170. But in fact, the number of our captured personnel killed was clearly more than this, and even Boatner admitted that there were other corpses "still being searched for." In order to destroy the evidence, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on the 10th, the American aggressor troops had "burned Camp 76 to the ground." Boatner shamelessly blamed the American massacre on the resistance of our captured personnel in his statement, but news from Geoje Island by the American news agency on the 10th revealed long ago that before the U.S. military entered the camp, they "first threw tear gas and concussion grenades into the camp" (Associated Press), and then "charged into the camp under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, firing a thousand flame-thrower rounds, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades" (United Press). The executioner Boatner actually described this premeditated massacre of unarmed prisoners of war with vicious weapons as the result of resistance by our captured personnel, and understated it as "not a single shot fired," which is truly the height of shamelessness.

In order to impose crimes on our captured personnel, Boatner lied, saying that one American soldier who died in the attack was stabbed to death by the "spearhead" of our captured personnel. However, the U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters gave Boatner a resounding slap in the face in a communique issued on the 11th. The Eighth Army's communique admitted that this American soldier was killed by the concussion grenade he threw himself. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 10th also said that, according to information obtained from Clark Headquarters, the soldier was killed by his own grenade.

The facts of the American aggressors' massacre of prisoners of war are all there, and no absurd statement can deny them. The American aggressors can never shirk the responsibility for this and any previous and future bloody massacres. According to Associated Press reports, Boatner has arrested sixteen to eighteen of our captured personnel related to the detention of Dodd after the massacre, preparing to persecute them. This further proves that this bloody massacre by the U.S. side was entirely an act of savage retaliation.

According to American news agency reports, the U.S. side has dispersed our captured personnel in Camps 77 and 78. The detailed circumstances of the dispersal have not been revealed. Boatner declared that "in the new, smaller camps, there are Allied guards inside," and these personnel will "continue to remain within them" (Associated Press). Obviously, the U.S. side is using even more cruel special agent rule to persecute our captured personnel.

### 美方无耻声明企图推卸巨济岛大屠杀的罪责

    美方无耻声明企图推卸巨济岛大屠杀的罪责
    【新华社开城十二日电】美国侵略者在对巨济岛上第七十六号营场中的我方被俘人员进行了血腥大屠杀之后，现在正一面竭力推卸罪责，一面继续对其他营场中的我方被俘人员进行残酷的迫害。
    在屠杀事件发生以后，美国刽子手波纳和美国第八军总部在十日和十一日先后发表了极端无耻的声明和公报，企图推卸屠杀我方被俘人员的严重罪责，并掩饰事实的真相。波纳承认，已知的被杀伤的我方被俘人员已达一百七十人。但事实上被杀害的我方被俘人员显然不止此数，连波纳也承认还有其他尸体“仍在继续寻找中”，而为了毁尸灭迹，据美联社巨济岛十日电透露，美国侵略军已经把第七十六号营场“烧得精光”。波纳在他的声明中把美方的屠杀无耻地归罪于我方被俘人员的抵抗，可是美国通讯社十日从巨济岛发出的消息早就透露，美军在尚未进入营场以前就“先向营场内投掷催泪弹和震荡手榴弹”（美联社），然后在“坦克和装甲车掩护下冲入这个营场，发射了一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹”（合众社）。刽子手波纳竟然把这种对赤手空拳的战俘用凶恶的武器蓄意进行的大屠杀，说成是我方被俘人员进行抵抗的结果，并且轻描淡写地说成“一枪未放”，实在是无耻到了极点。
    为了给我方被俘人员强加罪名，波纳撒谎说，在进攻中死亡的一名美军士兵是被我方被俘人员的“矛尖”刺死的。但是美国第八军总部在十一日发表的公报却有力地给了波纳一记清脆的耳光。第八军的公报承认：这个美军士兵是被他自己投出的震荡手榴弹炸死的。美联社东京十日电也说：从克拉克总部所获得的消息，这个士兵是自己炸死的。
    美国侵略者屠杀战俘的事实俱在，决非一纸荒唐的声明所能抵赖得了的。美国侵略者决不能推卸对这一次以及以前的和今后的任何一次血腥屠杀应负的责任。据美联社消息，波纳在进行屠杀以后，已将与扣留杜德的事件有关的十六到十八名我方被俘人员拘捕，准备加以迫害。这就更加证明美方这次血腥屠杀，完全是野蛮已极的报复行为。
    据美国通讯社消息，美方已经将第七十七和七十八两个营场中的我方被俘人员加以分散。分散的详细情形没有被透露出来。波纳宣称，“在新的较小的营场中，有联军看守人员在内”，这些人员并将“继续留在其中”（美联社）。显然美方正在用更残酷的特务统治来残害我方被俘人员。
