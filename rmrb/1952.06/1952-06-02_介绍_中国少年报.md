    Introducing "China Young Pioneers Newspaper"
    Zi Gang
    The Young Pioneers of China launched a national team newspaper, "China Young Pioneers Newspaper," on November 5th of last year. This newspaper is published every Monday and has already released thirty issues. It is more capable than the previous "China Young Pioneers" magazine in providing timely assistance to young readers and guiding their actions. The recent circulation has reached 485,000 copies, and further expansion of circulation is planned.
    The Central Ministry of Education and the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League issued a notice on February 12th of this year, requiring local education administrative departments, Youth League committees, teachers, and counselors to assist in running "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" well, listing it as a major extracurricular reading material, and launching subscription work. The purpose of this measure is to make this newspaper an important tool for educating the vast number of young children. "Be prepared: to struggle for the cause of building the motherland, for the realization of Chairman Mao's great ideals!"—This is the slogan of the Young Pioneers, printed under the title of "China Young Pioneers Newspaper."
    "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" is warmly welcomed by the vast number of young children because it conducts education combining patriotism and internationalism based on the physical and mental characteristics and cognitive level of young children, improves their cultural and knowledge level, and cultivates their new qualities centered on "five loves." On the other hand, it combines the work of the Young Pioneers, guides team activities, and reflects the life of the team and young children. The newspaper has four pages in broadsheet format each issue. The first page is for important news, the second page is for scientific knowledge, the third page is for team activities, and the fourth page is for literature and art.
    Checking the thirty issues of "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" reveals that it is constantly progressing. It grasps the central tasks of the country in each period, combines them with the actual lives of young children, uses both pictures and texts, and educates in various forms. This small newspaper simultaneously performs the tasks of a propagandist, educator, and organizer.
    During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, this newspaper made comparisons between good and bad character examples, arousing strong love and hate in the children. Many children reported family members who had made mistakes. They were deeply moved after reading the report on Zhang Ziliang's hard work and simple life. One child, seeing Zhang Ziliang writing with a broken fountain pen, dismissed the idea of ​​asking his parents to buy him a new fountain pen.
    The children love the Volunteers, love the Korean people and the People's Army, and hate American imperialism. Hong Sun-cheol, the head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, wrote them "Lovely Red Scarves," and they were extremely happy. Commanders and fighters of the Volunteers also often write articles for their newspaper. The children all know that defending peace is defending the future and defending the children. The revolutionary heroism of the Volunteers has influenced the children's thoughts and feelings. The stories published in the newspaper about Luo Shengjiao heroically sacrificing his life to save a Korean child from an icy river, and about how Volunteer comrades worked hard and practiced thrift on the front lines, have played a significant role in their daily behavior.
    Learning the spirit of selfless labor of the working class is also something that "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" often emphasizes to the children. The children understand that the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement is for the construction of the motherland, and they often narrate examples of their love for labor and thrift in short articles. Some children participate in the barren hill afforestation movement, and some children have done a lot of things for the families of revolutionary martyrs.
    The newspaper's introductions of collective farms and agricultural production models are also welcomed by the children. The prospects of socialist and communist production attract the children, and they are eagerly preparing to welcome such a beautiful future.
    The introductions commemorating the four great cultural figures enabled the children to realize that defending peace and defending culture are inseparable.
    Recently, Zhang Tianyi's several works have given the children great education. "The Story of Luo Wenyin" has made many children correct the habit of not cherishing time and wandering around idly, and promoted the team members to better help and unite non-team members. "They and Us" wrote about the team members' collectivist spirit. These works touched the children's spiritual world, making them very moved.
    The editorial department of "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" receives thousands of letters and contributions from readers every month. These letters and contributions are written in a very affectionate and interesting way. No matter how big or small, they must tell their team newspaper. Young Pioneers in the countryside also write letters, suggesting that more rural affairs be published. Team members in various places often conduct collective reading and discussion in reading groups.
    The children's love for "China Young Pioneers Newspaper" is just like what a young reader wrote:
    "I have a good guide, it's really helpful to me,
    I am with it every day, we will never be separated,
    Everyone moves forward with it, and will surely be a good child."
    Bless the children of the new China, bless "China Young Pioneers Newspaper," and wish you forever forward!

    介绍“中国少年报”
    子冈
    中国少年儿童队从去年十一月五日起，创办了全国性的队报“中国少年报”。这个报纸每逢星期一出版，已经出了三十期。它比过去的“中国少年儿童”杂志更能够及时地帮助少年儿童读者，指导他们的行动。最近的发行额已达四十八万五千份，以后还要扩大发行。
    中央教育部和新民主主义青年团中央委员会在今年二月十二日，发过一个通知，要各地教育行政部门和团委、教师和辅导员协助办好“中国少年报”，把它列为主要课外读物，开展订阅工作。这个措施的目的是要使这份报纸成为教育广大少年儿童的重要工具。“准备着：为建设祖国的事业，为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗！”——这是印在“中国少年报”报头下的少年儿童队的呼号。
    “中国少年报”所以受到广大少年儿童的热烈欢迎，是因为它根据少年儿童的身心特点和认识水平，进行爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，提高他们的文化知识水平，培养他们以“五爱”为中心内容的新品质。另一方面，它结合少年儿童队的工作，指导队的活动，反映队和少年儿童的生活。报纸每期四开四版，第一版是要闻，第二版是科学知识，第三版是队的活动，第四版是文艺。
    检查三十期“中国少年报”，就可以看出它是在不断进步的。它抓紧了国家每一时期的中心任务，结合了少年儿童的生活实际，图文并茂，以多种多样的形式进行教育。这张小报纸同时执行了宣传者、教育者和组织者的任务。
    在三反、五反运动中，这张报纸把好的坏的人物事例作了对比，引起孩子们的强烈的爱和憎。许多孩子检举了犯错误的亲人。他们看了张子良的坚苦朴素生活的报道，很受感动。有一个小朋友看到张子良用破水笔写字，便把自己想请父母买新水笔的念头打消了。
    孩子们热爱志愿军，热爱朝鲜人民和人民军，仇恨美帝国主义。朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲给他们写了“可爱的红领巾”，他们高兴极了。志愿军的指战员也常有人给他们的报纸写稿。孩子们都知道保卫和平就是保卫未来、保卫孩子。志愿军的革命英雄主义影响了孩子们的思想感情，报纸上所刊载的关于罗盛教在冰河里救出朝鲜孩子而壮烈地牺牲自己生命的事迹，关于志愿军同志如何在前线刻苦节约的故事，都在他们的日常行为中起了很大的作用。
    学习工人阶级的忘我劳动的精神，也是“中国少年报”经常向孩子们强调的。孩子们明白了增产节约运动是为了建设祖国，时常在小文章里叙述自己热爱劳动和节约的事例。有的孩子参加荒山造林运动，有的孩子为烈军属们做了不少事情。
    报纸上关于集体农庄和农业生产模范的介绍，也是孩子们所欢迎的。社会主义和共产主义的生产的远景吸引着孩子们，他们热切地准备着迎接那么美丽的未来。
    纪念四大文化名人的介绍，使得孩子们认识了保卫和平与保卫文化是分不开的。
    最近，张天翼的几篇作品给孩子们很大教育。“罗文应的故事”使得很多小朋友改正了不爱惜时间，闲荡胡玩的习惯，推动了队员们更好地帮助和团结非队员们。“他们和我们”写出了队员的集体主义精神。这些作品接触到孩子们的精神世界，使得他们非常感动。
    “中国少年报”编辑部每月接到几千封读者来信和投稿，这些信、稿写得十分亲热有趣，不拘大小事情，都要告诉自己的队报。乡村里的少年儿童队员们也写信来，提出多登农村事物的意见。各地队员们经常在读报组进行集体读报、讨论。
    孩子们对“中国少年报”的爱好，正如一个小读者所写的：
    “我有一个好向导，对我的帮助真不小，
    我和它天天在一起，我们永远不分离，
    大家跟它齐向前，定能作个好少年。”
    祝福新中国的少年儿童们，祝福“中国少年报”，祝你们永远前进！
