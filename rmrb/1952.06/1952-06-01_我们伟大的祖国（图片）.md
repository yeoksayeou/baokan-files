    Our Great Motherland
  　Protecting children is an important part of the cause of safeguarding peace. The children of New China under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong are happy; our children also love the motherland and love peace. These two children participated in a children's party on the eve of International Children's Day. Holding their own raised peace doves, they said, "Look how beautiful our doves have grown!"
