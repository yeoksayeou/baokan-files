    The Romanian people continue to condemn the barbarous atrocities of the US imperialists in slaughtering our captured personnel.
    According to the Romanian News Agency, the 12th regular session of the Romanian National Assembly recently adopted a resolution condemning the atrocities committed by the US aggressors against captured personnel from Korea and China. The resolution states: The US imperialists have barbarously violated humanitarianism, ethics, and all standards of international law, and shamelessly trampled upon the international agreements they themselves signed. The just resistance of the POWs in the Koje Island and Busan POW camps against the aggressors demonstrates the perfidy and hypocrisy hidden beneath the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation" charade. The Romanian people, upon hearing of the mass slaughter perpetrated by the devils among humans—the US imperialists—have been ignited with hatred and anger.
    The resolution states: We, the members of the Romanian National Assembly, together with all progressive humanity, demand an immediate halt to the monstrous crimes of the US militarists and an immediate end to their predatory war against the heroic Korean people. We firmly demand compliance with the Hague and Geneva international conventions concerning prisoners of war, and that Korean and Chinese POWs be treated with humanitarian spirit. We demand that the executioners—US Generals Ridgway, Colson, Dodd, Bonner, and others—who have lawlessly and murderously slaughtered captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in order to prolong the war and expand the war to the whole world, be brought before a people's court for trial.
    The Bucharest "Spark" newspaper, in its weekly international review column, also emphasized that the bloody slaughter of the US aggressors cannot achieve their goals. The POWs of Korea and China will never yield, just as the people of Korea and China will never yield. Throughout the world, people everywhere have issued loud calls saying: "Stop the atrocities of the US cannibals in Korea! Severely punish the US war criminals!"

    罗马尼亚人民斥责美国屠杀战俘暴行
    【新华社讯】罗马尼亚人民继续斥责美帝国主义者野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行。
    据罗马尼亚通讯社消息：最近举行的罗马尼亚国民议会第十二次常会一致通过决议，斥责美国侵略者对朝中被俘人员所施的暴行。决议说：美帝国主义者野蛮地破坏了人道、伦理和一切国际法标准，无耻地践踏着他们自己签订的国际协定。巨济岛和釜山战俘营中的战俘对侵略者进行的正义抵抗，表明了在美方所谓“自愿遣返”的鬼话下面掩藏着何等不讲信义和虚伪的事实。罗马尼亚人民听到人类中的魔鬼——美帝国主义者的大批屠杀行为，心中燃起了憎恨和愤怒的火焰。
    决议说：我们罗马尼亚国民议会议员，和全体进步人类一道，要求立即制止美国军国主义者的滔天罪行，立即制止他们对英勇的朝鲜人民所进行的掠夺战争。我们坚决要求遵守有关战俘的海牙和日内瓦国际公约，以人道精神对待朝中战俘。我们要求把那些为了延长战争和扩大战争到全世界而无法无天地杀害朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的刽子手——美国将军李奇微、柯尔生、杜德、波纳等——送到人民法庭审讯。
    布加勒斯特“火花报”在其每周国际评述栏中也强调说：美国侵略者的血腥屠杀决不能达到他们的目的。朝鲜和中国的战俘决不会屈服，正像朝鲜与中国的人民决不屈服一样。世界各国人民到处都已发出响亮的呼声说：“制止美国吃人生番在朝鲜的暴行！严惩美国战犯！”
