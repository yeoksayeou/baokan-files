    On the Leadership System and Methods of Propagandist Transmission Stations
    Zhang Tong
    (I)
    The propagandist transmission station is a base that supplies propagandists with propaganda materials and centrally directs their activities. Therefore, establishing and improving the system of propagandist transmission stations is an important task for consolidating the rural propaganda network. Especially in some newly liberated villages where party branches have not yet been established, the rapid establishment of transmission stations is of even greater significance for strengthening the practical leadership of county and district party committees over propagandists.
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party," various localities have established propagandist transmission stations in succession as propagandists have developed. According to statistics from last December: The Northeast region has established 4,683 transmission stations, transmitting a total of 32,747 times; the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar in the North China region have established a total of 7,600 propagandist transmission stations, of which Hebei province alone has 4,175; about 50 percent of the districts in the East China region have established transmission stations; Hubei province in the Central South region has established 855 transmission stations, and Hunan province has also established 216. The establishment and development of the work of propagandist transmission stations has improved the ideological and professional level of propagandists and enhanced their working ability. As a result, the Party and government's policies have been correctly implemented, enabling the broad masses to engage in the movements to Resist America, Aid Korea, Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, and patriotic production increases, as well as various other tasks under correct ideological guidance. During the summer grain collection last year, the reporters of Daming County, Hebei Province, all went to the transmission station to report the significance of the summer grain collection to the propagandists. Based on the instructions of the reporters, the propagandists mobilized the masses of the entire county to complete the summer grain collection task in one day. There are many examples of this kind of effective promotion of work through propaganda.
    (II)
    Judging from the work of propagandist transmission stations in various localities, adhering to the necessary transmission system is the central link for strengthening the Party's leadership over transmission stations and running them well. Over the past year, the county and district party committees in various localities have generally attached importance to the leadership of transmission stations. However, some county and district party committees still do not fully understand the role of transmission stations, believing that "there is already a lot of work, and establishing transmission stations will add trouble to district and village cadres." Therefore, some do not adhere to the transmission system or confuse transmission with the assignment of administrative tasks. Although this phenomenon has been repeatedly criticized in practical work, some party committees have not yet seriously led the work of transmission stations, which must be corrected immediately.
    In order to do a good job in the work of propagandist transmission stations, the following systems should generally be established and adhered to:
    First, district party committees, district reporters, and some county reporters should implement a transmission responsibility system (i.e., a contract system). Each member of the district party committee or district reporter should be responsible for the work of a transmission station within their scope of activity, grasp the ideological situation of the masses and the work problems in their jurisdiction, conduct transmission on schedule, and lead the stationmaster of the transmission station in daily work. He is fully responsible for the success or failure of the transmission station's work.
    Second, adhere to the system of timely transmission. The transmission date should preferably be determined after democratic discussion in order to enhance everyone's awareness of abiding by the system. According to existing materials, most transmissions in various localities are held once every half month, which is more appropriate. Each transmission should generally be two hours, and at most should not exceed three hours.
    Third, hold regular meetings of transmission stationmasters or hold short-term training courses to explain the important significance of transmission stations and promptly resolve temporary ideological and work problems encountered by transmission stationmasters.
    Fourth, the county party committee should establish a reporting system after transmission and regularly (every ten or fifteen days) listen to the reports of transmission stationmasters. In addition, it is necessary to check the effectiveness of the transmission at any time. Based on the results of the reports and checks, a monthly bulletin should be issued to commend and criticize in a timely manner, promote good experiences, and prevent transmission work from becoming a mere formality. The district committee should regularly (every three months or half a month) report and study the work of transmission stations and make regular summaries.
    (III)
    To run propagandist transmission stations well, it is also necessary to have practical transmission content and adopt the mass line method for transmission. Transmission content: First, it must be based on the current work and political situation, closely combined with the ideological situation of the masses and the problems existing in the work, and transmission should be carried out "with a definite object in view." For example, in Hejian County, Hebei Province, district reporters addressed the masses' fear of "revealing wealth" in selling cotton, and in the tenth district of Pingding County, Shanxi Province, district reporters addressed the peasants' tendency to exaggerate the disaster situation in the autumn grain collection, and reported on the purchase of cotton and the collection of grain at the transmission station, correcting the above-mentioned ideas and tendencies. The practice of not studying the masses' thinking and simply reciting the existing propaganda materials word for word from beginning to end cannot solve practical problems. Second, the transmission content should be concise, popular, and specific. The transmission content should not be too much each time, it is best to talk about only one or two issues, and pay attention to giving more examples familiar to the masses, and avoid talking about seven or eight issues at a time, so as not to make everyone unable to remember clearly.
    In terms of transmission methods, first, sufficient preparation must be made before each transmission, a lecture outline must be prepared, and it must be approved by the district party committee (or county party committee). The lecture outline should preferably be printed out and distributed to propagandists after the transmission to avoid errors when they convey it back to the village. Second, in addition to the reporter's explanation, some time must be taken for propagandists to discuss each time in order to digest the transmission content. At the same time, propagandists should also report on the previous propaganda situation, promptly promote good propaganda methods, and correct errors in time if they are found. Propagandists in Niangziguan Village, Pingding County, Shanxi Province, once forced the masses to donate with the words "not donating is forgetting the roots," and regarded this erroneous propaganda as "a sharp needle that fundamentally solves the problem" in the report. After everyone's discussion, this error was corrected. Third, systematically organize propagandists to make on-the-spot visits. For example, in Shanxi Province, during the patriotic production increase movement last year, propagandists were organized to visit the situation of Wang Yongsheng's mutual aid group in Lujiazhuang watering the land with water pipes (a winch can water two and a half acres of land a day, and a water pipe can water five acres a day); and Wang Yongsheng was invited to tell the propagandists about his experiences at the North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition. After returning to the village, the propagandists mobilized seven villages to install forty-six water pipes. Fourth, after each transmission, the stationmaster should go deep into the villages to check and understand the propaganda effect and the ideological situation of the masses. The district committee should also focus on helping the weak branches to carry out transmission in order to overcome the imbalance in transmission work.
    (IV)
    Finally, for the convenience of leadership and transmission, first, villages with a good working foundation and a suitable location should be selected to establish transmission stations. This makes it easier to convene all propagandists to the transmission station to listen to lectures, and it is also possible to organize propagandists to study some experiences on the spot. Second, each transmission station should have one or two stationmasters to help the district committee manage the transmission station, supervise and help the propagandists of each village to come to the transmission station to study; and understand the work of the propagandists, as well as the ideological situation of the propagandists and the masses, and report to the district committee regularly. The stationmaster of the transmission station should be a village cadre or primary school teacher with a decent style, prestige among the masses in the area, and a high political and cultural level. In some places in Shanxi, members of the district committee or district reporters serve as stationmasters, which is worth considering. Because the work of the district committee and district reporters is very busy, if all the affairs of the transmission station are done by them, it is easy to affect other work.

    关于宣传员传授站的领导制度和方法
    张同
    （一）
    宣传员传授站是供给宣传员宣传资料，集中指挥宣传员活动的基地。因此，建立和健全宣传员传授站制度，乃是巩固农村宣传网的重要工作。特别在没有建立起党支部的某些新区乡村，迅速设立传授站，对于加强县、区党委对宣传员的实际领导，更有其重要意义。
    自从党中央颁发了“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”以后，各地随着宣传员的发展，相继建立了宣传员传授站。根据去年十二月的统计：东北区已建立了传授站四千六百八十三处，共传授了三万二千七百四十七次；华北区的河北、山西、平原、察哈尔四省，共建立宣传员传授站七千六百处，其中仅河北一省即有四千一百七十五处；华东区约有百分之五十的区已建立了传授站；中南区的湖北省已建立传授站八百五十五处，湖南省也建立了二百一十六处。宣传员传授站的建立及其工作的开展，提高了宣传员的思想水平和业务水平，增强了宣传员的工作能力，因而党和政府的各项政策得以正确贯彻，使广大群众在正确思想引导下投入抗美援朝、镇压反革命和爱国丰产运动，以及其他各种工作。去年夏征时，河北大名县的报告员全体出动，到传授站向宣传员报告了夏征意义。宣传员根据报告员的指示，动员全县群众一天完成了夏征任务。像这种经过宣传有效地推动了工作的例子是很多的。
    （二）
    根据各地宣传员传授站工作的情形来看，坚持必要的传授制度，是加强党对传授站的领导和办好传授站的中心环节。一年来，各地的县委和区委对传授站的领导，一般地说还是重视的。但是，也还有一些县委、区委对传授站的作用认识不足，他们认为：“工作已经很多了，建立传授站又要给区、村干部添麻烦。”因此，有的不坚持传授制度，或把传授和布置行政任务混同起来。这种现象虽然在实际工作中一再批判，但有些党委至今没有认真领导传授站的工作，这是必须立即纠正的。
    为了把宣传员传授站的工作作好，一般应建立和坚持下列的制度：
    第一、区委、区报告员和一部分县报告员，应实行传授负责制（即包干制）。每个区委委员或区报告员要按照每人的活动范围，分工负责一个传授站的工作，掌握所辖地区的群众思想情况和工作问题，按期进行传授，并领导传授站站长进行日常工作。传授站的工作好坏，由他完全负责。
    第二、坚持按时传授的制度。传授日期最好经过民主讨论后确定，以增强大家遵守制度的自觉性。根据现有材料来看，各地传授大多数是半月一次，这是比较合适的。每次传授时间，一般应是两小时，最多不能超过三小时。
    第三、定期召开传授站站长的会议或举办短期训练班，讲明传授站的重要意义，及时解决传授站站长在思想上和工作上临时发生的问题。
    第四、县委应建立传授后的汇报制度，并定期
    （十天或十五天）听取传授站站长的汇报。另外，要随时检查传授的效果。根据汇报和检查的结果，每月通报一次，及时进行表扬和批评，推广好的经验，防止传授工作流于形式。区委会则应定期（三个月或半个月）汇报和研究传授站工作，并定期作出总结。
    （三）
    要办好宣传员传授站，还必须有切合实际的传授内容，并采用群众路线的方法进行传授。传授内容：第一，必须根据当前的工作和政治形势，密切结合群众的思想情况和工作中存在的问题，“有的放矢”地进行传授。如河北省河间县区报告员针对群众在卖棉花中怕“露富”的思想，山西省平定县十区报告员针对农民在秋征中夸大灾情的偏向，在传授站上进行了购棉和征粮的报告，纠正了上述的思想和偏向。那种不研究群众思想，光把现有的宣传资料一字一句、从头到尾照念一遍的作法，是不能解决实际问题的。第二，传授内容应该简明、通俗和具体。每次的传授内容不要过多，最好只讲一两个问题，并注意多举群众熟悉的事例，切忌一次就讲七八个问题，免得大家记不清楚。
    在传授方法上，第一，每次传授前必须充分准备，作好讲授提纲，并经区委（或县委）讨论批准。讲授的提纲最好能印出来，在传授后发给宣传员，以免他们在回村传达时发生错误。第二，每次传授时除报告员讲解外，一定要拿出一些时间，让宣传员进行讨论，以便消化传授内容。同时还应该让宣传员汇报上次宣传情况，及时推广好的宣传方法，如果发现错误则及时纠正。山西平定县娘子关村的宣传员，曾以“不捐献，就是忘本”的话来硬让群众捐献，并且把这种错误的宣传，当作“一针见血，根本解决问题的好方法”在会上汇报。经过大家的讨论，才纠正了这种错误。第三，有计划地组织宣传员作实地参观。如山西在去年爱国丰产运动中，曾组织宣传员参观了鹿家庄王永盛互助组水管浇地的情形（辘轳一天浇地二亩半，水管一天能浇五亩）；并请王永盛向宣传员讲述了他在华北区城乡物资交流展览会上的见闻。宣传员回村后，就发动七个村安装了四十六部水管。第四，每次传授以后，站长应深入各村进行检查，了解宣传效果和群众的思想情况。区委也应有重点地到力量薄弱的支部帮助进行传授，以克服传授工作不平衡的现象。
    （四）
    最后，为了领导和传授的方便，第一，应该选择工作基础较好，位置又适中的村庄，建立传授站。这样既便于召集所有宣传员到传授站听讲，又可以组织宣传员就地学习一些经验。第二，每个传授站应该设站长一人或二人，帮助区委管理传授站，督促和帮助各村宣传员到传授站学习；并了解宣传员的工作情况，以及宣传员和群众的思想情况，定期向区委汇报。传授站站长以由作风正派、在片村群众中有威信、政治文化水平较高的村干部或小学教员担任为宜。山西有的地方由区委委员或区报告员作站长，这个办法值得考虑。因为区委和区报告员的工作都很忙，如果传授站的一切事情都由他们来作，容易影响其他工作。
