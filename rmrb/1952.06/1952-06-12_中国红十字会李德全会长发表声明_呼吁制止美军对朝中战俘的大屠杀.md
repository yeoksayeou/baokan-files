Xinhua News Agency, June 11th—Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, issued a statement regarding the continued forced "screening" and abuse and murder of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the U.S. military. The full text is as follows:

On February 18th of this year, after the incident in which the U.S. military violated the Geneva Conventions and collectively massacred Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on Geoje Island, I issued a just accusation to all honest people around the world on February 28th, demanding immediate and effective action to stop this cruel atrocity and defend the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross.

However, the U.S. military has not ceased its bloody crimes due to the solemn condemnation of honest people around the world. On the contrary, they have become even more intensified, continuously and extensively abusing and massacring unarmed Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war under the guise of illegal "screening." According to a May 24th report by the U.S. news agency, on April 10th, in another massacre on Geoje Island, Korean and Chinese prisoners of war suffered more than 60 casualties. On May 20th, the U.S. military forcibly conducted "screening" at the Busan POW camp, killing and injuring as many as 86 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Similar brutal incidents also occurred at the POW camp in Yeongcheon. According to a U.S. news agency report, on June 10th, the U.S. military launched a long-planned massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, with U.S. soldiers charging into the camp under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, firing approximately 1,000 flamethrower rounds, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war killed and injured has reached 170.

Everyone knows that during the Korean armistice negotiations, the U.S. side created the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, which completely violates international law and the Geneva Conventions, and conducted "forced screening" in an attempt to unreasonably detain more than 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. When Korean and Chinese prisoners of war rose up to defend their fundamental right to immediate repatriation after the armistice, the U.S. military used machine guns, grenades, flamethrowers, and even flamethrower tanks to massacre and persecute them. Heinous crimes such as starvation, torture, cruel punishment, hanging, strangulation, poisoning, waterboarding, and use as experimental subjects for chemical, atomic, and bacteriological weapons have been successively inflicted on Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Now, Geoje Island has become an unprecedented hell on earth; even more sinister and cruel than the Buchenwald and Auschwitz concentration camps of Hitler's bandits in World War II. Human dignity is being subjected to base humiliation and barbaric trampling there!

The various bloody crimes committed by the U.S. military mentioned above are inseparable from its deliberate conspiracy to delay and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations. This crime not only barbarically violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention for the Protection of Prisoners of War but is also a vicious attack on human dignity and just conscience, and an attack on world peace. Based on the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross, I, on behalf of the Chinese Red Cross Society, once again issue an urgent appeal to Red Cross workers and members around the world, calling for them to unite with all peace-loving people under the banner of humanitarianism, to immediately take effective measures to protect human dignity, uphold international justice, and stop the brutal crimes of the U.S. military in massacring Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Geoje Island, Busan, Yeongcheon, and other places.

### 中国红十字会李德全会长发表声明  呼吁制止美军对朝中战俘的大屠杀

    呼吁制止美军对朝中战俘的大屠杀
    【新华社十一日讯】中国红十字会李德全会长对美国军队继续实行强迫“甄别”和虐杀朝中被俘人员一事发表声明。全文如下：
    今年二月十八日，美国军队违反日内瓦公约、在巨济岛集体屠杀朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员一事发生后，我曾于二月二十八日向全世界正直人们提出正义的控诉，要求立即以有效行动制止这种凶残的暴行，保卫红十字人道主义原则。
    但是，美国军方并不因全世界正直人们的严正指责而中止他们的血腥罪行，相反地，更变本加厉，连续不断地借着非法“甄别”的名义，大肆虐待与屠杀赤手空拳的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员。根据五月二十四日的美国通讯社报道，四月十日，美国军队在巨济岛另一次大屠杀中，朝中被俘人员伤亡达六十多人。五月二十日，美国军队在釜山战俘营强行“甄别”，又杀伤朝中被俘人员数达八十六人之多。类似的残杀事件，亦发生于永川地方的战俘营。据美国通讯社报道，六月十日，美军又对朝中被俘人员开始了谋划已久的大屠杀，美军士兵在战车和装甲车掩护下冲入营场，发射了约一千发喷火弹，震荡手榴弹，催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹。据英国广播公司透露，朝中被俘人员死伤已达一百七十人。
    世人皆知，在朝鲜停战谈判过程中，美方制造了完全违反国际公法和日内瓦公约的所谓“自愿遣返”原则，进行“强迫甄别”，企图无理扣留十万以上的朝中被俘人员。当朝中被俘人员起来维护他们停战后立即遣返回家的基本权利时，美国军队就用机枪、手榴弹、喷火器、甚至喷火坦克对他们进行残杀与迫害。诸如饿饭、拷打、酷刑、吊死、绞杀、毒死、灌水、作为化学、原子能、和细菌武器实验等惨绝人寰的罪恶行为，陆续施诸朝中被俘人员的身上。现在，巨济岛已成为人类有史以来空前的人间地狱；比第二次世界大战中希特勒匪徒们的布痕瓦尔德和奥斯威辛集中营尤为阴森惨酷。人类的尊严在那儿受到卑贱的凌辱，横蛮的践踏！
    上述美国军方所犯的种种血腥罪行，都是和它蓄意拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋分不开的。这一罪行不仅是横蛮地破坏了日内瓦战俘公约保护战俘的规定，而且是凶恶地向人类尊严和正义良心进攻，向世界和平进攻。本诸红十字人道主义的原则，我代表中国红十字会再一度向全世界红十字工作者与会员发出紧急的呼吁，要求在人道主义的旗帜之下，与一切爱好和平的人民联合起来，立即采取有效的办法，保护人类尊严，伸张国际正义，制止美国军队正在巨济岛、釜山、永川等地屠杀朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的残暴罪行。
