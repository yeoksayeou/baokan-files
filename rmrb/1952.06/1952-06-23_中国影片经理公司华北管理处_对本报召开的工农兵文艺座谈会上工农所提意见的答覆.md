Response from the North China Management Office of the China Film Management Corporation to Opinions Raised by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers at the Literary and Art Symposium Convened by This Newspaper

Editor: Our office began studying documents on May 23rd, the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and examined and discussed them in conjunction with our specific work, using the three records of the Capital Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Literary and Art Symposium convened by you. After this period of study, we have tentatively formulated systems related to "actively and periodically supplying factories and mines with politically and educationally meaningful films," "increasing the quantity of projection team propaganda materials and striving for simple and easy-to-understand language," "reducing film rental fees for various units," and "specially reducing film rental fees for suburban and rural areas." We are preparing for these systems and reporting them to higher authorities for approval, with the intention of implementing them from July 1st. We are willing to listen to opinions from all sides at any time, further improve our film distribution work, and truly achieve the goal of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with films. Here are our responses to some audience opinions:

    I. Regarding the hope that projection teams will show films in suburban factories. At the end of 1950, the Central Film Bureau convened a symposium of projection teams from the four major systems of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, trade unions, cultural and educational institutions, and the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. The meeting decided that the trade union projection teams would be responsible for showing films in factories and mines in and around Beijing, with films supplied by our office. We have already written to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to strengthen the work of showing films to workers in suburban areas in response to audience opinions on this matter.

    II. Regarding the hope for preferential treatment for factories renting films. First of all, we must admit that in the past, the work of renting films to various factories and mines was unplanned, and selections were made on a first-come, first-served basis, without sufficient consideration. Comrade Zhao Rui's suggestion is correct. However, due to the limited number of films and difficulties in scheduling, it is difficult to always have suitable and newer films available for rent. In order to discuss and resolve this issue, we have issued a notice deciding to hold a meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss the issue of film supply to suburban factories.

    III. Regarding the issue of film rental fees being too expensive. We have already mentioned earlier that we will be reducing film rental prices. In the past, we overemphasized the capital for film reproduction, and the rental fees were set too high, which increased the burden on various units. In the future, film rental prices must take into account the economic capacity of various units.

    IV. Regarding the hope that suburban factories can show first- and second-run films. In terms of improving the film distribution method, we have already distributed second-run films to various units in suburban areas as much as possible, and we plan to request the film studio to issue more specially screened copies, preparing to supply first-run films, and strive for urban and suburban areas to see the same films at the same time.

    V. Regarding the hope for more explanation before film screenings. Currently, "propaganda points" have been published for key films. When films are screened, projection teams in various units can be mobilized to strengthen the explanation of the film content.

    In short, in the past, we overemphasized "economic" tasks and did not grasp the policies well. We did not realize that this is an important political task, which is indeed worthy of our attention and future efforts!

    We have already begun holding special reception screenings for "May Day," "May Fourth," and "June 1st" and other special festivals in cinemas, as well as regular army appreciation screenings and screenings to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers. During this year's "May Fourth" and "June 1st," we also cooperated with the celebration committee to send a large number of projection teams to show films in urban and suburban areas. We obtained consent from state-owned film studios and the Soviet Film Export Corporation on behalf of various units to provide films free of charge. Usually, in terms of rental fees, in order to encourage projection teams to go to the countryside to serve farmers, film rental fees in rural areas have always been lower than in urban areas. The newly formulated system makes rural film rental fees even lower than urban film rental fees.

    In the past three years, our work in distributing people's films has indeed been insufficient. We have not improved technically, but have only conservatively maintained the old set of experiences, and we have not closely followed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic guidelines to achieve the "distribution first to the basic audience, propaganda first from the basic audience" as instructed by the Central Film Bureau. In the future, we are willing to improve our work in distributing people's films under the supervision and assistance of all parties.

### 中国影片经理公司华北管理处  对本报召开的工农兵文艺座谈会上工农所提意见的答覆

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国影片经理公司华北管理处
    对本报召开的工农兵文艺座谈会上工农所提意见的答覆
    编辑同志：我处从五月二十三日，即毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年纪念日，开始学习文件，并以你们召开的首都工农兵文艺座谈会的三篇记录，结合我们的具体工作，加以检查讨论。我们经过这一段的学习，初步定出了有关“主动定期供给各工、矿富有政治、教育性的影片”，“增加放映队宣传品量、文字力求通俗”，“减低各单位租映影片租金”，和“特殊减收郊区、农村影片租金”等制度。我们正根据这些制度进行准备工作，并报请上级核示，拟自七月一日起实行。我们愿意随时听取各方面的意见，把我们的电影发行工作更进一步改进，真正做到电影为工农兵服务。这里是我们对观众意见的几点答覆：
    一、希望放映队到郊区工厂放映电影的问题。在一九五○年末，中央电影局曾召集中苏友好协会、工会、文教机关、人民革命军事委员会总政治部四大系统的放映队举行座谈会。会议决定工会的放映队负责在北京市内外工、矿中放映电影，影片由本处供给。观众对我们所提的有关这方面的意见，我们已函请市总工会加强在郊区工人中放映电影的工作。
    二、工厂租片希予照顾问题。首先我们要承认，以前对于各工矿租用电影片的工作，是无计划的，随来随挑，照顾得太不够。赵瑞同志所提意见是正确的。但限于影片数量，调度困难，很难随时都有适宜的较新的影片出租。为了协商解决这一问题，我们已发出通知，决定在本月二十二日开会商讨郊区工厂的供片问题。
    三、影片租金太贵的问题。我们对影片即将减低租价，已在前面说过了。过去我们过分强调了影片再生产的资本，租金订得高了一些，使各单位负担加重，今后影片的租价一定要照顾各单位的经济能力。
    四、郊区工厂希望放映头二轮影片事。在影片调配方法的改进上，我们已经把二轮影片尽量分配到郊区各单位，并计划请求制片厂增发专映拷贝，准备供应头轮影片，争取城市和郊区能同时看到同一影片。
    五、希望在影片放映前多加说明。目前重点影片已经刊发“宣传要点”。影片在放映时，可以动员各单位的放映队，加强对影片内容的说明工作。
    总之，我们过去过分强调了“经济”任务，没有很好地掌握政策，没有认识到这是一个重要的政治工作，这确是值得我们正视和今后努力的！
    我们已经开始在影院举办“五一”“五四”“六一”等特殊节日的招待场，经常的劳军场、慰劳烈属军属场。我们在本年“五四”“六一”并配合庆祝委员会派出大批放映队到城郊放映。我们代各单位向国营制片厂和苏联影片输出公司征得同意，免费供给影片。平时在租金方面，我们为了鼓励放映队下乡为农民服务，在农村的片租一向是低于城市的。新订的制度，乡村片租比城市片租更低了。
    三年来我们对人民电影的发行工作，的确作得很不够。我们没有很好地在技术上提高，只是保守着过去的一套经验，也没有紧紧地遵循着毛主席的文艺方针，作到中央电影局所指示的“发行先到基本观众中去，宣传先从基本观众中来”。今后我们愿在各方面督促帮助之下，搞好我们人民电影的发行工作。中国影片经理公司华北管理处
