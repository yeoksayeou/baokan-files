People's Bank of China Beijing Branch
Issues Loans to Support Private Enterprises

The "Five-Anti" campaign in Beijing has now basically concluded. Workers and staff in private industrial and commercial enterprises are uniting with the capitalists, actively restoring and developing their businesses under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government. The People's Bank of China Beijing Branch is promptly issuing loans to vigorously support private industry and commerce. According to statistics, by the end of May, the total amount of loans issued by the branch to private industry and commerce had exceeded three times that of the same period last year. The number of households receiving loans included 6,628 households across 114 industries. The bank's loans to private industry and commerce are still expanding.

The timely provision of loans has played a significant role in restoring the production of private industrial and commercial enterprises, presenting a new atmosphere. After the "Tongyi" Water Pump Factory received a loan of 150 million yuan from the bank, it added sand-casting equipment and actively prepared to launch a production competition, planning to increase output by 25% and reduce the price of each water pump by 22%. Before the "Five-Anti" campaign, the capitalist of the "Lian" Steel File Factory had recklessly implemented the "five poisons". However, due to the factory capitalist's good performance in the "Five-Anti" campaign, they received lenient treatment from the government and obtained bank loan support, which greatly developed their business. The factory's production volume in May had already reached twice the total production of February, March and April, and increased by 70% compared with the average monthly output before the "Five-Anti" campaign. Ruifuxiang Silk Fabric Store borrowed 600 million yuan from the bank to purchase mass-market goods, orienting its business towards the general public. The store's turnover in April and May both increased by more than double that of February. The capitalists who received loan support expressed their gratitude to the government.

Currently, the bank is issuing loans and systematically overcoming past shortcomings. In supervising the use of loans and supervising collateral, it has begun to implement the mass line, relying on the broad masses of workers and staff to overcome the past bias of relying solely on external staff and listening to only one side of the story from the capitalists.

    人民银行北京分行
    发放贷款扶持私营企业
    北京市“五反”运动现在已经基本结束。私营工商业的职工，正在团结资方，在市人民政府的领导下，积极恢复和发展业务。中国人民银行北京分行及时发放贷款，大力扶助私营工商业。据统计，到五月底为止，该行对私营工商业的贷款总额，已超过去年同时期的三倍。获得贷款的户数，包括一百十四个行业的六千六百二十八户。该行对私营工商业的贷款，仍在扩大中。
    适时地进行贷款，对恢复私营工商业的生产，起了很大作用，使工商业呈现了一片新的气象。“同益”水泵厂得到银行一亿五千万元的贷款以后，增添了翻砂的设备，积极准备开展生产竞赛，计划把产量提高百分之二十五，并将每台水泵价格降低百分之二十二。“五反”运动前，“立安”钢锉厂资方曾经放肆地行施“五毒”，由于该厂资方在“五反”运动中表现较好，得到了政府宽大处理，并获得了银行贷款扶助，因而大大发展了业务。该厂五月份的生产量已经达到二、三、四月各月份生产总和的二倍，比“五反”运动以前每月平均产量提高了百分之七十。瑞蚨祥绸布店资方向银行贷款六亿元，购买大路货，在业务上面向广大群众。该店四、五两月份的流水额，都比二月份增加一倍以上。得到贷款扶持的资本家都对政府表示感激。
    现在银行发放贷款，有计划地克服过去的缺点，在监督贷款用途和监督押品方面，开始实行群众路线，依靠广大职工，克服了过去单靠外勤、单听资方一面之词的偏向。     （中国人民银行总行通讯组）
