(Xinhua News Agency) As of June 7th, the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project is nearing completion, and the Jingjiang Diversion Project has completed over 83%. Currently, the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate and the Huangshantou Control Gate are rushing to install gate leaves and place riprap. The installation of gate leaves at the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate has increased from four gates per day to six gates per day, and the riprap project for the anti-scour apron is nearing completion. All employees engaged in the construction of the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Diversion Project are working at full speed, striving to complete the entire project ahead of schedule by June 20th.

The construction of the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Diversion Project has achieved a decisive victory in the past two months. The vast numbers of workers, peasants, and military personnel have become proficient in their respective tasks. Labor organization has become more sound and rational, and cadres' leadership experience has also become richer. At present, the construction efficiency of each worksite is increasing day by day. The most arduous task of transporting materials has also been completed on May 25th (one month ahead of schedule). All of these are guarantees for early completion. This year, the Yangtze River flood arrived earlier than in previous years, and the Jingjiang water level had reached 39.5 meters at the end of May. All employees feel the urgency of time and have requested to complete the task ahead of schedule to protect the interests of the broad masses of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River.

The decision to complete the project by June 20th was unanimously supported by all employees after discussions by Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, labor models, and the broad masses at various worksites and units. Each unit and individual has adopted a "contract" method based on their specific circumstances, and has formulated specific plans to ensure the early completion of their respective tasks. After calculation, the command headquarters of the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate and Huangshantou Control Gate decided to complete all gate works ahead of schedule on June 18th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, responsible for repairing the Huangtian Lake Dike project, guaranteed to complete the task before June 15th. At the worksite, led by Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and labor models, 300,000 workers, peasants, and military personnel have further promoted the patriotic labor emulation campaign on the basis of the May competition. The workers responsible for pouring concrete at the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate used to pour 4,000 cubic meters of concrete per day. After the decision to complete the project within a specified time was issued, under the organization and leadership of Communist Party member Shen Liangyi and others, it has been increased to more than 4,600 cubic meters per day. The efficiency of concrete workers at the Huangshantou Control Gate has also increased by 30%. The concrete work of both gates has been completed. The fourth squad of the steel reinforcement model team, which created the record of tying one gate bottom slab steel reinforcement in seven and a half hours, completed all steel reinforcement tasks five days ahead of schedule on June 2nd. Chairman Mao's inscription is a great encouragement to all employees. Military personnel responsible for transporting large stones said: "Chairman Mao inscribed words for us in his busy schedule and sent representatives to comfort us. We must complete the task with a hundredfold effort to thank him." The unit has increased the efficiency of loading one bucket of stones in eight seconds to four seconds. During the stone loading process, Communist Youth League member Huang Zaiyao's hands were blistered, but he refused to rest. He said: "When I think of Chairman Mao's concern for us, I feel energized and don't feel any pain. I want to strive for great merit and meet Chairman Mao in Beijing." Under the leadership of Communist Party members, 20,000 migrant workers in the Yichang Special District have completed more than 600,000 cubic meters of earthwork ahead of schedule. 95% of the Party members among the migrant workers in the special district have become labor models. The progress of the project in the most recent week has exceeded any previous week, and the completed projects are all up to standard. Recently, the Jingjiang Diversion General Headquarters has organized another major inspection to achieve the complete victory of the entire project.

(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, June 9th) The main sluice gate manufacturing project for the Jingjiang Diversion Project was completed on May 27th and has been transported to the worksite in batches for installation.

The Jingjiang Diversion sluice gate is divided into two parts: the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate and the Huangshantou Control Gate. The gate leaves (including accessories) weigh more than 1,700 tons in total. These two parts of the gate leaves are manufactured by the Wuhan Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company, Jiang'an Bridge Factory, and Hengyang Railway Bureau Engineering Department, respectively. In order to complete all installations before the arrival of the Yangtze River summer flood at the end of June, the manufacturing work must be completed before the end of May. Facing this urgent task, the workers of each factory launched competitions, giving full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity, and overcoming the difficulties encountered in their work at any time. When the No. 2 Factory of Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company was manufacturing the Taipingkou gate winch, according to the factory's existing equipment, it would require twelve foundry workers to make one turbine on each winch, making it difficult to complete the original task on time. After repeated research by the factory's veteran worker Huang Leting and others, they created an operating method of dividing the turbine model into eight pieces, reducing the casting of each turbine to one and a half foundry workers, thus shortening the manufacturing of all turbines by more than 1,000 workdays. In the 42 days of manufacturing the gate leaves for the Huangshantou Control Gate, the Hengyang Railway Bureau Engineering Department improved more than 40 kinds of tools and operating methods, greatly shortening the gate manufacturing process. The efficiency of workers in the competition has been continuously improved, ensuring that the quality of the gate leaves meets the specifications and saving a lot of raw materials.

(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, June 9th) Two rationalization proposals in the process of manufacturing the Jingjiang Diversion sluice gate have saved the state steel materials worth 4.3 billion yuan in Renminbi. The four technicians who made the rationalization proposals have been rewarded and commended by the Jingjiang Diversion General Headquarters. Among them, Li Fen, Ding Yu, and Liu Yingzhou are administrative and technical personnel of the Bridge Section of the Hengyang Railway Bureau Engineering Department. When they represented the Hengyang Railway Bureau to the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission to accept the task of manufacturing the gate leaves for the Huangshantou Control Gate, they found that many parts of the gate were irrationally designed, wasting a lot of steel. For example, the connection of the gate plate was not subjected to much force, and only two rows of rivets were enough, but the original design added four rows. The shear force of the rivets was 16,000 pounds per square inch, but the original design calculated it at 8,000 pounds. The vertical beam could have no cover plate, but the original design added cover plates on the top and bottom. In total, due to the irrational design, manufacturing such a gate would waste 128 tons of steel and 120,000 rivets. After this waste in the project was discovered, they immediately drafted opinions to revise the original design, which was finally approved by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. According to recent statistics, the steel and rivets saved as a result of the implementation of this rationalization proposal are worth 3.5 billion yuan in Renminbi.

Wang Xiancheng is an engineer of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission. He also discovered another phenomenon of wasting steel in the design of the steel reinforcement project for the sluice gate base slab. The base slab of the control gate is 14 meters long and 10.5 meters wide. It is designed using the German "Weskard" formula. According to the original design, a steel bar was placed every 12 centimeters on the base slab. As a result of this even distribution of force, the force was insufficient at the most critical parts of the project, while the steel bars were arranged too densely in most places where the force was not great. Engineer Wang Xiancheng carefully studied this situation and consulted with experienced workers at the worksite, believing that reasonably widening the row spacing of steel bars in certain parts of the gate base could save a large amount of steel without affecting the quality of the project. After his opinion was put forward, the Jingjiang Diversion General Headquarters held a forum for technicians to discuss it, and finally affirmed that Wang Xiancheng's opinion was feasible and decided to widen the steel bar spacing by 24 centimeters in certain parts of the gate base project. According to statistics, adopting this rationalization proposal can also save the state 800 million yuan in steel wealth.

    荆江分洪工程完成百分之八十三以上
    全部工程将在六月二十日完工
    两个有关水闸工程的合理化建议为国家节省四十三亿元
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：截至六月七日，荆江大堤加固工程已接近完成，荆江分洪工程已完成了百分之八十三以上。现在，太平口进洪闸和黄山头节制闸都在突击安装闸门和抛砌块石，太平口进洪闸安装闸门已由每日安装四孔提高到六孔，防冲漕的抛砌块石工程已接近全部完成。兴修荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程的全体员工都在全力赶修，为争取整个工程提前于六月二十日完工而奋斗。
    荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程施工两个月来，已获得了决定性的胜利。广大工人、农民、军工已熟练了他们所担任的各种劳动，劳动组织已作到更健全、更合理，干部的领导经验也更丰富了。目前，各工地的施工效率一天比一天高，工程中最艰巨的器材运输任务，也已在五月二十五日完成了（按计划提前了一个月）。所有这些，就是能够提早完工的保证。今年长江洪水来得比往年早，五月底荆江水位已达三九点五公尺。全体员工感到时间紧迫，纷纷要求提前完成任务，以保障荆江两岸广大人民的利益。
    六月二十日完工的决定，由各工地、各单位的共产党员、青年团员、干部、劳动模范和广大群众讨论后，得到了全体员工的一致拥护。每个单位到每个人都根据自己具体情况，采取“包干”办法，订出了具体计划，保证提前完成自己所担负的任务。太平口进洪闸和黄山头节制闸两闸工程指挥部经计算后，决定提前在六月十八日完成全部闸工，担任修黄天湖围堤工程的解放军某部保证在六月十五日前完成任务。工地上，在共产党员、青年团员和劳动模范的带头下，三十万工人、民工和军工，已将爱国主义劳动竞赛在五月竞赛的基础上更推进了一步。担任太平口进洪闸混凝土工的工人，过去每日浇灌混凝土四千公方，限期完工的决定发布后，在共产党员沈良义等组织领导下，已提高到每日浇灌四千六百多公方；黄山头节制闸混凝土工效率也提高了百分之三十。两闸的混凝土工都已完成了。创造过七时半扎一孔闸底版钢筋的钢筋模范分队第四分队，是提前五天在六月二日完成全部扎钢筋的任务的。毛主席的题字对全体员工是极大的鼓励。担任转运蛮石任务的军工说：“毛主席在百忙中题字和派代表慰问我们，我们一定以百倍努力完成任务来答谢他。”该部已将八秒钟装一斗车石头的工效，提高到四秒钟。在装石中，战士青年团员黄再耀手被磨起血泡，仍不肯休息，他说：“我一想起毛主席对我们的关怀，精神就来了，一点不觉痛，我要争取立大功，到北京见毛主席。”宜昌专区二万民工在共产党员带头下，已提前完成了六十多万公方土工的任务，该专区民工中的党员，百分之九十五都成了劳动模范。最近一周工程的进度超过了过去任何一周，而且完成的工程都是合乎标准的。最近，荆江分洪总指挥部又在组织一次大检查，以达到整个工程的完满胜利。
    【新华社汉口九日电】荆江分洪工程的主要水闸闸门制造工程，已于五月二十七日全部完工，现已分批运到工地安装。
    荆江分洪水闸分太平口进洪闸与黄山头节制闸两大部分，闸门（包括附件）共重一千七百多吨。这两部分闸门分别由武汉市江汉船舶机械公司、江岸桥梁厂和衡阳铁路局工务处承制。为了在六月底长江夏汛到来以前全部安装完毕，制造工作必须在五月底前完工。面对着这一紧急任务，各厂职工展开竞赛，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，随时克服工作中遇到的困难。江汉船舶机械公司第二厂承制太平口闸门绞车时，按照该厂现有设备，每制一个绞车上的涡轮就需用十二个翻砂工，这样原订任务很难按时完成。经过该厂老工人黄乐庭等反复研究，创造出将涡轮模型分为八块的操作法，使每个涡轮的铸造减少为一个半翻砂工，全部涡轮的制造因而缩短了一千多个工作日。衡阳铁路局工务处在制造黄山头节制闸闸门的四十二天内就改进了四十多种工具与操作法，使闸门制造过程大大缩短。竞赛中工人劳动效率不断提高，保证了闸门的质量合乎规格，节约了不少原材料。
    【新华社汉口九日电】制造荆江分洪水闸过程中的两个合理化建议，就为国家节约了价值人民币四十三亿元的钢料。提合理化建议的四位技术人员，已受到荆江分洪总指挥部的奖励与表扬。其中李芬、丁昱、刘瀛州三人是衡阳铁路管理局工务处桥梁科的行政、技术人员。他们在代表衡阳铁路管理局到长江水利委员会接受承制黄山头节制闸闸门任务时，发现这个闸门有许多地方设计不合理，浪费大量钢材。如闸板连结处受力并不大，只要两排铆钉够了，原设计却加用到四排。铆钉的剪力每平方英吋是一万六千磅，原设计却以八千磅计算。竖梁上本可不加盖板，原设计却上下各加了盖板。总计由于设计的不合理，制造这样一个闸门就要浪费钢料一百二十八吨和铆钉十二万个之多。这个工程上的浪费被发现后，他们立即拟出修正原设计的意见，最后得到长江水利委员会的同意。据最近统计，由于这个合理化建议执行的结果，节省下来的钢料与铆钉值人民币三十五亿元。
    王咸成是长江水利委员会的一个工程师。他在水闸闸基底板扎钢筋工程的设计上，也发现了另一个浪费钢材现象。节制闸的闸基底板有十四公尺长，一零点五公尺宽。它是引用德人“韦斯卡得”公式设计的。依照原设计，闸基底板每距十二公分即安放钢筋一根。这样平均分布力量的结果，就使得工程当紧之处力量不足，而大部分受力不大的地方钢筋却布置太密。王咸成工程师细心研究这种情况，并到工地和有经验工人商量后，认为合理地在闸基某些地方放宽钢筋的行距，可以节省大批钢筋而不影响工程的质量。他的意见提出后，荆江分洪总指挥部为此召开技术人员座谈会加以讨论，最后肯定了王咸成的意见可行，并决定在闸基工程某些地方，加宽钢筋行距二十四公分。采用这个合理化建议后，据统计亦可为国家节省八亿元钢筋的财富。
