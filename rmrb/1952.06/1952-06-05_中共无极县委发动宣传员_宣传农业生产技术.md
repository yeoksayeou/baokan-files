CPC Wuji County Committee Mobilizes Propagandists
    To Promote Agricultural Production Techniques

To the Editors: In the patriotic production increase campaign, the broad masses of farmers in Wuji County are eagerly seeking to learn production techniques. However, county, district, and village cadres lack agricultural production knowledge and feel unable to lead the farmers. Some cadres say: "It's easy to lead the production increase campaign, but it's really killing us to lead farmers in learning advanced production techniques!" Farmers say: "They just talk about improving techniques and increasing production, but how exactly do we improve? The higher-ups can't even explain it!" In order to change this situation, the County Committee organized cadres to study production techniques. The County Committee first printed and distributed the high-yield experiences of model farmers Zhao Changjing, Liang Jiarui, and Chen Erxing regarding millet, cotton, and yams to propagandists, reporters, and technical team leaders for study. At the same time, it organized thirty-five county and district reporters to go to thirty-five propagandist transmission stations throughout the county to impart advanced production techniques to more than 1,700 district and village cadres, propagandists, technical team leaders, primary school teachers, and active elements in production. The personnel responsible for transmission, focusing on the shortcomings existing in local production, used the advanced production experience of high-yield models to point out methods of improvement to farmers, and criticized certain backward production methods of some farmers. This kind of propaganda made village cadres more aware of the importance of learning techniques. Qi Xiaoshui, a propagandist from Lichengdao, said: "In the future, it won't work to just talk about a lot of fertilizer and diligent watering. We have to talk about techniques in everything we do. Without a good set of methods, just applying a lot of fertilizer and watering a lot won't increase yields."

    Now Wuji County is mobilizing the masses to learn new production techniques to ensure the thorough realization of this year's production increase plan. Ding Xiangzhi, Lei Shufen, Han Yimin

    中共无极县委发动宣传员
    宣传农业生产技术
    编辑同志：在爱国增产竞赛运动中，无极县广大农民，迫切要求学习生产技术。但是，县、区、村干部都缺乏农业生产知识，感到无法领导农民。有的干部说：“增产竞赛好领导，领导农民学习先进生产技术真难死人！”农民说：“光说提高技术，增加生产，倒底怎么提高？上级也说不出个什么门道来！”为了改变这种情况，县委把干部组织起来，学习生产技术。县委首先把丰产模范赵常经、梁家瑞、陈二兴关于谷子、棉花、山药的丰产经验，印发给宣传员、报告员、技术组长学习；同时组织了三十五个县区报告员，分别到全县三十五个宣传员传授站，向一千七百多区村干部、宣传员、技术组长、小学教师和生产中的积极分子传授先进生产技术。负责传授的人员针对当地生产中存在的缺点，运用丰产模范的先进生产经验，给农民指出改进的方法，批判某些农民落后的生产方法。这种宣传使村干部更加认识到学习技术的重要。里城道宣传员齐小水说：“往后光说粪大、水勤吃不开了，干啥也得讲技术，没有一套好办法，光上大粪，浇大水，也不能增加收成。”
    现在无极县正在发动群众学习新的生产技术，保证今年增产计划的彻底实现。丁祥志　雷树芬　韩益民
