Advocating Collective Transactions in Rural Cooperative Trade
North China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Office

Starting last year, in many areas of North China, farmers have been collectively selling cotton and collectively purchasing fertilizer to/from supply and marketing cooperatives, or conducting other collective transactions of goods. For example, in eight counties within the Yuncheng and Linfen regions of Shanxi province, 53 villages have implemented collective cotton sales. In Wanglanzhuang, Henggu, and Gaoxiandian villages of Fengnan County, Tangshan region, Hebei province, 153 mutual aid teams have collectively sold cotton. Nearly half of the grassroots cooperatives in this region have adopted the method of supplying fertilizer to mutual aid teams in whole batches. The Fuzhuang Joint Village Cooperative in Huojia County, Pingyuan Province, has also carried out collective cotton sales among cotton farmers and has organized the supply of production materials and daily necessities to farmers. Some grassroots cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives/mutual aid teams have signed combined contracts to conduct transactions of various agricultural and sideline products and various industrial goods.

These collective cotton sales, collective fertilizer supply, or other collective goods transaction activities are mostly carried out by mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. Experience has shown that collective transactions conducted in the form of contracts are most appropriate when carried out by mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. In the past, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of North China mostly signed pre-purchase contracts and combined contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, while transactions carried out by villages were only a minority. The forms, contents, and scope of collective transactions vary: some are relatively simple, temporary, and involve only one type of commodity transaction; others are longer-term, more planned, and involve collective transactions of a wider variety of commodities; some even use contract forms to fix this collective transaction. This organized method of purchasing agricultural products and providing farmers with production and daily necessities is a new form of expanding the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas, and it has a very important significance in promoting the development of the urban and rural economy.

Collective transactions between cooperatives and farmers, especially the use of combined contracts and pre-purchase contracts, which are more advanced methods, can promote the planning of farmers' production, consumption, and the business operations of supply and marketing cooperatives, and can closely coordinate the purchasing and supply operations of the state and cooperatives, integrating the state's economic plans with farmers' production plans. Through this integration, the leadership role of the state-owned economy over the small-peasant economy can be strengthened.

Collective transactions carried out by the state or supply and marketing cooperatives with mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are not an ordinary business method. They can promote and improve farmers' collectivization, strengthen urban-rural relations, strengthen the connection between industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Various collective transactions between supply and marketing cooperatives and farmers are compatible with the increasingly heavy purchasing and supply tasks of the state and cooperatives.

Collective transactions greatly improve the efficiency of cooperatives' business operations and can ensure the rapid and smooth completion of the state's and cooperatives' purchasing and supply tasks. For example, after implementing collective transactions, the Wanglanzhuang Joint Village Cooperative in Fengnan County, Hebei, increased its cotton collection efficiency by three times, and the cooperatives in the Tangshan region completed their first-quarter fertilizer supply task within one and a half months. Our current economic situation is that, on the one hand, agricultural production is developing rapidly, the organization level and purchasing power of farmers are increasing, and the vast number of farmers urgently demand the supply of sufficient production materials and daily necessities, and promote the sale of their agricultural and sideline products; on the other hand, the country's industrial construction will also be launched on a larger scale, the demand for industrial raw materials and commodity grain is increasing, and industrial products also need to expand their sales markets. Under such circumstances, the supply and marketing tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives are becoming increasingly heavy. However, if the grassroots organizations of supply and marketing cooperatives are not sound, and they have not yet adopted planned, organized, and large-scale purchasing and supply methods, but only adopt the method of sporadic transactions with individual farmers (which is of course also necessary), it is impossible to complete this huge supply and marketing task. This has been proven in the cotton acquisition in North China last year and the fertilizer supply this year. Therefore, it is the correct way for cooperatives to deal with organized farmers—farmers in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives—and implement planned, batch transactions in the future.

Through this collective transaction, the connection between cooperatives and mutual aid teams/agricultural production cooperatives is further strengthened, which can promote the development of industry and agriculture; and it can be used to conduct collectivist education for farmers, enhance farmers' cooperative habits, and avoid pursuing market profits. When many mutual aid teams in the Tangshan region collectively purchased fertilizer, they demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, helping poor households to buy fertilizer. Undoubtedly, this will gradually enhance farmers' collective thinking and habits and abilities of collective activities. The combined contract between the Beidanche Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as Party A) in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, and the agricultural production cooperative of the village (hereinafter referred to as Party B) stipulates: "In terms of supply, Party B shall pay 10% to 15% of Party A's commodity price list when calculating members' order forms on the 15th of each month, or exchange in kind, and pay the rest in full when supplying; in terms of sales, when Party A purchases, it shall pay Party B two-thirds of the current amount (or exchange in kind) according to Party A's commodity price list, and pay the rest after the goods are sold." This method is also very effective in organizing mass capital and cultivating farmers' cooperative habits.

This method can save farmers' labor, animal power, and cooperative manpower. Henggu Village in Fengnan County saved a total of 409 labor days by collectively selling more than 85,000 jin of cotton three times; and saved a total of 670 labor days by collectively purchasing 200,000 jin of fertilizer. Gaoxiandian Village saved 259 labor days for 264 households by collectively selling 50,000 jin of cotton; and saved even more labor days by collectively purchasing 125,000 jin of fertilizer. These collective transactions also avoided queuing and crowding when selling cotton and purchasing fertilizer.

This collective transaction between cooperatives and farmers has such important functions and benefits and should be promoted with leadership and in a step-by-step manner. Relevant leading cadres in various places should carefully and sensitively pay attention to the creativity of the masses, select new buds growing in new economic soil, help the development of these buds, summarize and exchange experiences. When supply and marketing cooperatives carry out collective transactions, they should do so through contracts (pre-purchase contracts or combined contracts) as much as possible. Gradually develop a single purchase or supply into a "give-and-take" transaction that combines purchase and supply. Gradually apply the experience of collective transactions in cotton collection and fertilizer sales to the work of acquiring commodity grain, other industrial raw materials, bulk native products, and supplying farmers with bulk production materials and daily necessities, and overcome the current blindness in cooperative trade.

It must be pointed out that collective transactions must be carried out after full ideological mobilization and meticulous and in-depth organizational work, and must be completely voluntary by the masses, strictly preventing coercion and formalism. The most effective way to persuade and educate farmers is through typical demonstrations. Only after the masses personally feel the material benefits through simple, easy, and acceptable methods can the vast number of farmers be powerfully organized into the orbit of the cooperative movement. It is necessary to prevent the method of blindly promoting without considering the conditions. The contracts that are signed must be able to be realized. Every economic activity of farmers should be educated with patriotism and collectivism to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm and consciousness. Cooperative cadres must strengthen the idea of serving the working people and serving industrial and agricultural production, and resolutely eliminate the purely profit-seeking capitalist business ideology and business methods.

    提倡在农村合作贸易中实行集体交易
    华北供销合作总社办公室
    从去年开始，华北不少地区的农民向供销合作社集体售棉和集体购肥，或进行其他物品的集体交易。例如：山西运城、临汾两专区八个县有五十三个村实行了集体售棉。河北唐山专区丰南县王兰庄、横沽、高先甸等村有一百五十三个互助组集体售棉。该专区近半数的基层合作社采取了整批向互助组供应肥料的办法。平原省获嘉县府庄联村社也在棉农中开展了集体售棉工作，并有组织地供应农民生产资料和生活资料；有一些基层合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组订立了结合合同，进行各种农、副业产品和各种工业品的交易。
    这些集体售棉、集体供肥或其他物品的集体交易活动，大部分是以互助组或农业生产合作社为单位进行的。经验证明：采用合同形式进行的集体交易，以互助组和农业生产合作社为单位最为恰当。过去华北各地合作社大多是以农业生产合作社、互助组为对象订立预购合同、结合合同的，以村为单位进行的只是少数。集体交易的方式、内容、范围是各种各样的：有的还是比较简单的、临时的、只包括一种商品的交易；有的是较长时期的、更有计划的、包括种类较多的商品的集体交易；有些并用合同的形式，把这种集体交易固定下来。这种有组织地收购农产品和有组织地供给农民以生产和生活资料的集体交易方式，是扩大城乡商品流转的一种新形式，它在促进城乡经济的发展上有非常重要的意义。
    合作社和农民进行集体交易，特别是采取结合合同、预购合同这一较高级的方式进行集体交易，可以促进农民生产、消费和供销合作社经营业务的计划性，并可把国家和合作社的收购及供应业务密切配合起来，使国家的经济计划和农民的生产计划结合起来。通过这种结合，可以加强国营经济对小农经济的领导作用。
    国家或供销合作社对互助组、农业生产合作社进行的集体交易，并不是一种普通的经营方式，它可以促进和提高农民合作化、密切城乡关系、加强工农业生产的联系，巩固工农联盟。
    供销合作社和农民之间的各种集体交易，和日益繁重的国家和合作社的收购、供应任务是相适应的。
    集体交易大大提高了合作社经营业务的效率，可以保证国家和合作社的收购及供应任务迅速地和顺利地完成。如进行集体交易之后，河北丰南县王兰庄联村社提高收棉效率达三倍，唐山专区的合作社在一个半月内就完成了第一季度供肥任务。我们目前的经济情况是：一方面农业生产正在迅速地发展着，农民的组织程度和购买力日益提高，广大农民迫切要求供给足够的生产资料和生活资料，并推销其农副业产品；另一方面，国家的工业建设也将更大规模地展开，工业原料、商品粮食的需求日益增大，工业品也需要扩大销售市场。在这样形势之下，供销合作社的供销任务就日益加重了。但是，如果供销合作社的基层组织不健全，还没有采取有计划、有组织和大批的收购和供应方式，而还只采取和个体农民零星交易的方式（这当然也是必要的），是不能完成这一巨大供销任务的。这是去年华北各地收购棉花和今年供应肥料中已被证明了的。因此，合作社和有组织的农民——互助组、农业生产合作社的农民打交道，实行有计划的成批的交易，是今后合作社供应和收购方式的正确途径。
    通过这种集体交易，进一步密切了合作社和互助组、农业生产合作社的联系，可以促进工农业的发展；并可借以向农民进行集体主义的教育，增强农民的合作习惯，避免追逐市场利润。唐山专区不少互助组集体购肥时，发挥了互助合作的精神，帮助贫困户买到了肥料。无疑的，这就会逐渐增强农民的集体思想和集体活动的习惯与能力。山西省平顺县北耽车村供销合作社（下称甲方）和该村农业生产合作社（下称乙方）的结合合同中规定：“在供应方面，乙方在每月十五号统计社员定货单时，先按甲方商品牌价交百分之十至十五，或折交实物，其余在供应时全付；在推销方面，甲方收购时，按甲方商品牌价先付乙方现款（或折实物）三分之二，其余在货物销出后付清。”这种办法，对组织群众资力、培养农民合作习惯，也是很有效的。
    这种方式可以节省农民的劳力、畜力和合作社的人力。丰南县横沽村三次集体售棉八万五千多斤，共节省劳力四百零九个；集体购肥二十万斤，共节省劳力六百七十个。高先甸村二百六十四户集体售棉五万斤，共节省劳力二百五十九人；集体购肥十二万五千斤，节省劳力更多。这些集体交易，并避免了售棉和购肥时排队拥挤等现象。
    这种合作社和农民之间的集体交易，有这样一些重要的作用和好处，是应当有领导、有步骤地加以推广的。各地有关的领导干部要细心地、敏锐地注意群众的创造，挑选在新的经济土壤上生长的新的嫩芽，帮助这些嫩芽的发展，总结并相互交流经验。供销合作社进行集体交易时，要尽可能地通过合同（预购合同或结合合同）。把单一的收购或供应，逐步发展为收购和供应结合的“有来有往”的交易。把收棉、售肥中集体交易的经验，逐步地应用到收购商品粮食、其他工业原料、大宗土产和供应农民大宗生产资料、生活资料的工作中去，克服目前合作贸易中的盲目性。
    必须指出：进行集体交易，一定要经过充分的思想动员和细致、深入的组织工作，要完全出于群众自愿，严防强迫命令和形式主义的作法。向农民进行说服教育的最有效方法是典型示范。通过简单、容易和群众便于接受的办法，使群众亲身感到物质实惠以后，才能有力地把广大农民组织到合作运动的轨道上来。必须防止不看条件而盲目推广的办法。订立的合同，都必须是能够实现的。对农民的每一个经济活动，都要用爱国主义和集体主义的思想进行教育，以启发农民的积极性和自觉性，对合作社干部，则必须加强为劳动人民服务，为工农业生产服务的思想，坚决肃清单纯营利的资本主义经营思想和经营方式。
