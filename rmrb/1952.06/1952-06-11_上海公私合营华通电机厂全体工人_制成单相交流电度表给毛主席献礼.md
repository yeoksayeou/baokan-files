To Respected Chairman Mao: Since you issued the great call for increasing production and practicing economy, all the workers in our factory have enthusiastically launched this movement. Under the wise leadership of the Party and you, we have achieved certain results. In 1951, we overfulfilled the production plan: oil switches and controllers by 200.16 percent, switchboards by 103.43 percent, transformers by 106.18 percent, and electrical measuring instruments by 100.04 percent.

This year, in addition to vigorously launching the "Three-Anti" movement within the factory, we also guarantee to complete the production tasks. In the first half of this year, we will produce 46.5 billion yuan worth of wealth for the country, an increase of more than 50 percent based on the original foundation.

In order to celebrate our own holiday of the working class – "May Day" International Labor Day, we all wanted to create a gift to present to you – the great leader. We decided to present to you the first successfully manufactured single-phase AC electricity meter in the country as a gift to you for "May Day." This lightweight and beautiful electricity meter was completed before "May Day" after two years of continuous research and improvement, and its accuracy has reached international standards.

However, we are not proud or complacent because of this. There are still many shortcomings in the entire production that need to be improved, and there are many difficulties that we need to overcome. We guarantee to continue our efforts to improve technology, improve quality, reduce costs, and expand production. The future electrification of New China requires more electricity meters, power control equipment, transformers, and so on. Under the leadership of the Party and you, we must give full play to all our strength in the electrical manufacturing industry.

Respectfully wishing you good health,
        All workers of Shanghai Joint State-Private Enterprise Huatong Electric Motor Factory, East China Industrial Department

    制成单相交流电度表给毛主席献礼
    敬爱的毛主席：自从您发出了增产节约的伟大号召以后，我们全厂工人热烈的展开了这个运动。在党和您的英明领导下，我们已取得一定的成绩。一九五一年我们超额完成了生产计划：油开关及控制器是百分之二○○·一六，开关台是百分之一○三·四三，变压器是百分之一○六·一八，电表仪器是百分之一○○·○四。
    今年我们除了在厂内轰轰烈烈展开“三反”运动以外，还保证完成生产任务，今年上半年要为国家生产价值四百六十五亿元财富，在原有的基础上比去年增产百分之五十以上。
    为了庆祝我们工人阶级自己的节日——“五一”国际劳动节，我们大家都想要创造一件礼物来献给您——伟大的领袖。我们决定将全国第一次制成功的单相交流电度表献给您，作为“五一”节向您的献礼。这一只轻巧美观的电度表，是经过两年来不断的研究改进，终于在“五一”节前完成，其准确性已达到国际标准。
    但是，我们并不因此而骄傲和自满，在整个生产上还有很多缺点，尚待我们去改进，也有很多困难，需要我们去克服。我们保证要再接再厉为改进技术，提高质量，减低成本，扩大生产而努力。新中国将来的电气化，是需要更多的电表、电力控制设备和变压器等等的。在党和您的领导下，我们一定要在电器制造工业的岗位上发挥出我们全部的力量。
    敬祝您身体健康
        华东工业部上海公私合营华通电机厂全体工人
