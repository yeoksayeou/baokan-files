    Military Family Member Zhao Liandeng Thanks the People's Government for Its Care
    Editor: My eldest son and third son have both joined the army. As a glorious military family member, my family's life is very good, thanks to the care of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the broad masses. My family farms land and also runs a paper workshop. A few days ago, students and cadres from a certain military academy specifically came to help my family pull wheat. The comrades started working in the early morning while the stars were still out, and in less than a morning, they pulled the wheat from seven mu of land, solving my family's wheat harvesting difficulties. When they were pulling the wheat, I prepared some bean soup and cigarettes to give them, but they said, "We are your children; there's no need to be so polite between family members. It is our duty to help you pull wheat." They left without eating or drinking anything. This moved me to tears. I don't know what words to use to express my heartfelt gratitude. I have decided to farm the land well and run the paper workshop well to repay the comrades for their care for my family. I will write to tell my two sons on the front lines to focus on learning skills and work hard for the people. In their spare time, they should also help the local villagers and be good long-term workers for the people.

    军属赵连登感谢人民政府照顾
    编辑同志：我的大儿子、三儿子都参军了，我是一个光荣的军属。我家的生活，在共产党、人民政府和广大群众的照顾下，过得很好。我家种着地，还开了纸房。前几天收麦时，某军事干部学校的学员、干部们，特意来替我家拔麦子。同志们在一个还有星星的早晨便开始工作，不到一个上午的时间，就拔完了七亩地的麦子，解决了我家收麦的困难。在他们拔麦子的时候，我预备了一点豆汤、香烟送去，他们说：“我们就是您的孩子，一家人何必客气，我们帮助您拔麦子是应当的。”他们没有吃喝就走了。这使我感动得流了泪。我不知道用什么话来表示我内心的感激。我决定种好庄稼、搞好纸房，来回答同志们对我家的照顾。我要写信告诉在前线的两个儿子，嘱咐他们安心学习技术，好好为人民工作；在空闲时，也多多帮助当地老乡，做人民的好长工。石家庄市大谈村军属    赵连登
