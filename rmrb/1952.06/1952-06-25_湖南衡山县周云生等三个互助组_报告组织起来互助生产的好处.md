The Zhou Yunsheng and other three mutual aid teams in Hengshan County, Hunan, report on the benefits of organizing mutual aid production:
    Respected Chairman Mao: Last March, Lin Fenghe, a farmer in our township, organized a mutual aid team. All the team members were united and helped each other, and their enthusiasm for production was very high. The production difficulties of the thirteen poor and lower-middle peasant households in the team were all resolved within the mutual aid team. They saved a lot of labor and also harvested more than 10,000 catties of grain. We learned from their experience and organized ourselves during this year's spring plowing, and production was immediately much better than when we worked individually.

    Our three mutual aid teams have a total of thirty-two households and 172.5 mu of land. Twenty-one of our households lack cattle, and eighteen lack farm tools. We are voluntarily combined, and we work with one mind and quick hands. Our difficulties are all resolved through mutual aid. In the past, it took six workdays per mu to complete spring plowing, but now, organized, it only takes four workdays.

    We not only help each other within the team, but also help needy households outside the team. A large piece of land belonging to the family of military dependent Liu A'er collapsed and needed a dozen workdays to repair; the Zhou Yunsheng and Liu Yeqiu mutual aid teams helped her repair it, and it was done in one morning. She gratefully said, "The mutual aid team has a large number of people with one mind and great strength. I will write a letter to my son, telling him to kill more enemies to thank you."

    We are determined to cultivate meticulously, improve production technology, guarantee a bumper harvest on all our land, respond to your call for "increasing production and practicing economy," support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and build our great motherland.
    All members of the Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Jianjia, and Liu Yeqiu mutual aid teams, Xinkai Township, Hengshan County, Hunan

    湖南衡山县周云生等三个互助组
    报告组织起来互助生产的好处
    敬爱的毛主席：去年三月，我乡农民林丰和组织了一个互助组。全体组员团结互助，生产劲头很高，组内十三户贫雇农在生产上的困难，都在互助组内解决了。他们节省了许多人工，还多收了一万多斤谷子。我们学习他们的经验，在今年春耕时组织起来，生产比单干时立刻好多了。
    我们这三个互助组，共有三十二户、一百七十二亩五分田。我们有二十一户缺牛，有十八户缺农具。我们是自愿结合的，作活时心齐手快。我们的困难，都用互助的方法解决了。往年一亩田要六个工才能完成春耕，现在组织起来，只要四个工就行了。
    我们不但在组内互助，同时还帮助组外的困难户。军属刘阿二家的田塌了一大块，需要十几个工才能整好；周云生、刘业秋两个互助组帮她修理，一个早晨就弄完了。她感激地说：“互助组人多心齐力量大。我要写信给儿子，叫他多杀敌人来感谢你们。”
    我们决心精耕细作，提高生产技术，保证全部土地丰收，响应您“增产节约”的号召，支援中国人民志愿军，建设伟大的祖国。
    湖南衡山县新开乡周云生、周健家、刘业秋三互助组全体组员
