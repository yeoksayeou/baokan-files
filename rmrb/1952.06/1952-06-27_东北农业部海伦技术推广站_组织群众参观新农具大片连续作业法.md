Northeast Agricultural Department, Hailun Technology Extension Station
Organizes Masses to Visit New Agricultural Implements for Large-Scale Continuous Operation

The Hailun Technology Extension Station of the Northeast People's Government's Agricultural Department (in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province) uses real people, real events, and practical experience to educate farmers, making them realize that organizing, using new agricultural implements, and reforming farming methods are the only ways to develop agricultural production. Last year, only Lusheng Village in Hailun County used new agricultural implements; this year, the Extension Station has promoted new agricultural implements to ten mutual aid teams and one agricultural production cooperative in seven villages. The Extension Station led local farmers to start spring sowing on April 4th using horse-drawn mechanical agricultural implements. During the spring sowing period, a total of 34 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed with new-style plows, more than 300 hectares of cultivated land were plowed, and wheat, soybeans, flax, sorghum, etc., were planted with seeders. At the same time, a series of technical reforms were also carried out, such as seed selection, trial planting, seed disinfection, prevention and control of underground pests, the use of rhizobium inoculant for seed coating, and granular fertilizers. On May 17th, the Hailun Technology Extension Station and the Hailun County 17th District People's Government jointly invited more than 100 people, including village cadres, model workers, and production activists from all villages in the district, to visit the Wang Yongzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lusheng Village to observe the continuous operation of new agricultural implements on large tracts of land; and to visit the various crops planted with seeders.

The Wang Yongzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative (formerly a mutual aid team before this spring) uses new agricultural implements for cultivation and implements technical reforms, and the crops they grow are getting better year by year. Last year, their team had thirteen male laborers, fifteen female laborers, and thirteen horses. In addition to planting 42 hectares of land according to plan, they also reclaimed 22 hectares of wasteland and planted more than 4 hectares of multiple crops; and all of them achieved five hoeings and five weedings. In the autumn, they harvested 51,500 jin more grain than in previous years. This year, they organized an agricultural production cooperative, with contiguous land, giving fuller play to the effectiveness of new agricultural implements. During the spring plowing period, they used Soviet-style double-wheeled single-furrow plows, automatic wasteland plows, and Polish-style double-wheeled double-furrow plows to plow 45 hectares and 5 mu of land (Note: One hectare in the Northeast is equal to 15 mu, and one mu is equal to 1.5 mu), and all of them were planted with wheat, soybeans, and flax using seeders. In addition, they also tried planting 1 hectare of corn, half a hectare of sorghum, and two mu of millet. Due to the use of new agricultural implements for cultivation and sowing, and because the planting was timely and meticulous, the seedlings grew very vigorously. Before the visit, some farmers still had doubts about the effectiveness of new agricultural implements. When they arrived at the boundary of the Wang Yongzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative, they saw the endless flat-sown wheat, already half a foot high, neatly and verdantly green. Everyone praised it and expressed admiration. Tao Chunsheng, the head of the Shuangjin Village mutual aid team, said: "I haven't been to Lusheng Village for more than a year, and even the land has changed! The old mountain wilderness has also been turned into fertile land with new agricultural implements. No wonder Wang Yongzhen's team is doing so well! The old ridges are scorched hot by the sun, baking the crops dry. Look at the flat-ridged wheat planted by others with new agricultural implements, growing so fresh and green. They are sure to harvest more grain in the autumn." Everyone then visited Wang Yongzhen's continuous combined operation of double-wheeled single-furrow plows, sixteen-disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, seeders, and rollers on large tracts of land: the double-wheeled single-furrow plow turned the soil over in front, the disc harrows and spike-tooth harrows followed behind to break up the soil, the seeder immediately sowed the soybeans, and the roller followed to press the sown land. The cooperative members sat on the seats of the disc harrows and rollers, looking so relaxed and happy; they raised their whips high, sang the Great Production ditties, and worked leisurely. Everyone saw that flat-sowing soybeans with a seeder, sowing three ridges at a time, was even more uniform than planting them one by one by hand, and unanimously praised: "Using this thing to plant large fields is really wonderful, even the best spot planting can't compare!" Everyone said: After returning to the village, they must tell more people about the real people, real events, and practical experiences they have seen with their own eyes, and mobilize the masses in their villages to use new agricultural implements in large quantities.

    东北农业部海伦技术推广站
    组织群众参观新农具大片连续作业法
    东北人民政府农业部海伦技术推广站（在黑龙江省海伦县），用真人、实事、活经验教育农民，使农民认识到组织起来，使用新式农具，改革耕作法是发展农业生产的唯一的道路。去年，海伦县只有禄生村使用了新农具；今年推广站已经把新农具推广到七个村的十个互助组和一个农业生产合作社。推广站领导当地农民，在四月四日开始用马拉机械农具进行春播。在春播期间，共用新式犁开荒三十四垧，翻了三百多垧熟地，并用播种机种上了小麦、大豆、亚麻、高粱等。同时，也进行了选种、试种、种籽消毒、防治地下虫害、使用根瘤菌拌种和颗粒肥料等一系列的技术改革。五月十七日，海伦技术推广站和海伦县第十七区人民政府共同邀请全区各村干部、劳动模范、生产积极分子等一百多人，到禄生村参观王永珍农业生产合作社使用新农具在大片土地上进行连续作业的情况；并参观了用播种机种的各样庄稼。
    王永珍农业生产合作社（今春以前是互助组）使用新式农具耕种，实行技术改革，种的庄稼一年比一年好。去年他们全组有十三个男劳动力、十五个女劳动力、十三匹马，除了按计划种完四十二垧地以外，还开垦了二十二垧荒地，多种了四垧多熟地；而且全部做到了五铲五?。秋后，他们比往年多收了五万一千五百市斤粮食。今年组织了农业生产合作社，土地连成片，更加充分地发挥了新式农具的效能。春耕期间，他们使用苏联式双轮一铧犁、自动开荒犁、波兰式双轮双铧犁，翻了四十五垧五亩地（按：东北一垧等于十五市亩，一亩等于一·五市亩），都用播种机种上了小麦、大豆和亚麻，另外还试种了一垧玉米、半垧高粱、二亩谷子。由于用新式农具耕作播种，而且种得适时、细致，禾苗长得非常茁壮。没有来参观的时候，有些农民还对新式农具的效能，抱着怀疑的态度。他们走到王永珍农业生产合作社的地界时，看到望不到边的大片平播的小麦，已经齐刷刷、绿油油地长了半尺来高，大家一致赞叹，表示佩服。双进村的互助组长陶春生说：“一年多没到禄生村，连土地都变样啦！多年的老山荒，也用新农具开成了良田。不怪人家王永珍组干得这样心盛啊！旧垅槎子叫太阳晒得滚热，把庄稼烤得干巴巴的。看人家用新农具种的平垅麦子，长得又新又绿，秋后准定多打粮食。”大家随后又参观了王永珍使用双轮一铧犁、十六片圆盘耙、钉齿耙、播种机、镇压器在大片土地上进行连续结合作业的情况：双轮一铧犁在前面把土翻过，圆盘耙、钉齿耙跟在后面把土块弄碎，播种机紧接着就种上了大豆，镇压器跟着把播了种的地压好了。社员们坐在圆盘耙、镇压器的座位上，显得那么悠闲、愉快；他们高扬着鞭子，唱着大生产小调，从容地工作着。大家看到用播种机平播大豆，一次播三条垅，比用手一个个摆的还均匀，一致称赞说：“用这玩意儿种大田真是妙咧，就是再好的点种也比不上呀！”大家表示：回村后一定要把亲眼看到的真人实事活经验告诉更多的人，发动本村群众大量使用新式农具。（王锦威、李明发）
