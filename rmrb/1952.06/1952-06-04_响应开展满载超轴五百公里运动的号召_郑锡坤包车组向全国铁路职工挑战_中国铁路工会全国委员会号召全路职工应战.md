In its call to railway workers nationwide, the All-China Railway Trade Union pointed out that the challenge conditions of the Zheng Xikun contracted team were proposed after full preparation, repeated research, and strong support from all sides. If all railway workers actively respond to the Zheng Xikun contracted team's challenge competition, it will set off a wave of production increase and thrift conservation throughout the entire railway, rapidly develop the national railway's fully loaded, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement, promote the rapid advancement of production reform in the railway system, and improve the political awareness and cultural and technical level of railway workers nationwide.

The All-China Railway Trade Union calls on railway workers nationwide to take prompt action, convene group meetings, study the challenge conditions of the Zheng Xikun contracted team; combine with specific circumstances, analyze various indicators and capabilities, use their brains, tap potential, find shortcuts, and propose rationalization proposals; meticulously formulate realistic response conditions and specific implementation methods; actively contact various departments, obtain support from all sides, overcome conservative ideas and formalistic work styles, strive to achieve and exceed their own response conditions; and requires workers, staff, and technicians in all business departments of the national railway to quickly rise up to accept the challenge. Railway labor models and advanced groups in various places are preparing to take the lead in responding to this call, striving for greater achievements and greater glory.
