Editor's Note: Generally speaking, the people's teachers of New China are constantly transforming their thinking and improving their teaching content and methods under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, resulting in many new developments in our school education. However, some teachers do not sufficiently recognize the importance of their work, do not earnestly transform their thinking, and do not improve their work. They still allow bad thoughts and bad habits inherited from the old society to dominate them, which affects the general improvement and development of the people's education cause. The articles by Geng Jie and others published here are criticisms of some of these teachers' erroneous thoughts and actions. We hope that teachers in various places can consider these opinions and improve their work.

    Oppose Elevating Yourself by Attacking Others
    Geng Jie

    In a certain middle school, a homeroom teacher was very dissatisfied because a subject teacher often personally inquired about the students' thoughts, studies, and living conditions in his class, believing that the subject teacher was "usurping" his leadership. In fact, he was jealous of the subject teacher's prestige in the eyes of the students in his class.

    In another middle school, there was a teacher who liked to eavesdrop on other people's lectures outside the window. Upon hearing an error, he secretly publicized it greatly but did not inform the lecturer. This teacher said, "If I tell him, he will correct it!" Obviously, in his view, if others' lectures had no errors, it would be detrimental to himself.

    In addition, in some schools, some teachers secretly hoard experience and compete with each other; they emphasize how "chaotic" a certain class was "in the past" to imply that they are better than others; they even openly attack others and brag about themselves in front of students, attempting to create the impression that "this class cannot be taught without me."

    These teachers cannot find precedents for developing themselves while also developing others from their old experiences. Although they have seen and heard of this in the new society (they cannot help but see and hear of it), they regard it as an accidental miracle. Therefore, they stubbornly stick to their prejudices and believe that attacking others is the only way to develop themselves. They do not understand that this is precisely a reflection of the ideological consciousness of all exploiting classes that in order to develop themselves, they must hinder others.

    These overt or covert manifestations of the exploiting class ideological consciousness of teachers inevitably bring extremely serious harm to the people's education cause: comrades deceive and distrust each other, and do not cooperate with each other. Not only can they not research and help each other in the research of teaching materials, teaching methods, and student life guidance, but they also create unnecessary complications in addition to teaching work, creating many artificial obstacles in education work. As for the students, they not only cannot learn the knowledge and skills they should be able to learn from their teachers, but they also receive the indoctrination of the exploiting class ideological consciousness from their teachers, which they should never receive. The people of the motherland, and even every teacher who sincerely wishes to serve the motherland and the people, will no longer allow this phenomenon to continue.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi, when talking about the proletariat's attitude towards their comrades, said: "They (referring to the proletariat – note by the author) want to develop themselves, elevate themselves, but they must simultaneously develop others, elevate the position of the entire working class, in order to elevate themselves. They are unwilling to lag behind others in ideology, politics, and work, and have an extremely high desire to strive forward, but they must respect, cherish, and help those who are stronger than them in these aspects, and strive to learn from them, without any jealousy." To transform oneself with proletarian ideology cannot be, and should not be, just empty talk. While correcting other erroneous thoughts, how to consciously and actively correct the various incorrect relationships between comrades caused by the exploiting class ideological consciousness existing in the depths of one's soul is also an important topic for teachers' self-ideological remolding!

### 反对抬高自己，打击别人

    编者按：一般说来，新中国的人民教师都在共产党和人民政府的领导下不断地改造着自己的思想，改进着自己的教学内容和教学方法，使我们的学校教育中出现了不少新气象。但也有部分教师对自己工作的重要性认识不足，不认真改造自己的思想，不改进自己的工作，仍让从旧社会遗留下来的坏思想、坏作风支配自己，影响了人民教育事业的普遍改进和发展。我们在这里发表的耿介等的文章就是对这些教师的某些错误思想和行动提出批评的。我们希望各地教师能够考虑这些意见，改进自己的工作。
    反对抬高自己，打击别人
    耿介
    某中学校有一位班主任，因为一位科任教师常常亲自了解他班学生的思想、学习、生活情况而大为不满，认为是在“篡夺”自己的领导权。其实，他是在嫉妒这位科任教师在他班学生心目中的威信。
    另外一个中学校里，有位爱在窗外偷听别人讲课的教师，听出错处，暗暗大加宣扬而不告知讲课人。这位教师说：“一告诉他，他就改了！”显然，在他看来，别人讲课没有错误，就对他自己不利。
    此外，在某些学校里，某些教师密藏经验，竞相争风；强调某班学生“过去”真乱，暗示自己高过旁人一筹；甚至公然对着学生打击别人，吹嘘自己，企图造成“某班非我来教不成”的印象。
    这些教师，从他们的旧经验里，寻找不出发展自己，同时也发展别人的先例；在新社会里，对此虽也有所见闻（不能不有所见闻），但却把这看成偶然的奇迹；因而就固执成见，认定打击别人是发展自己的唯一途径。他们不了解这正是一切剥削阶级的为着发展自己必须妨害别人的思想意识的反映。
    教师们这种剥削阶级思想意识的或明或暗的流露，都不可避免地给人民教育事业带来了极其严重的损害：同志间尔诈我虞，互不合作，不但不能在教材、教法与学生生活指导的研究方面彼此研究、帮助，反而在教学工作之外别生枝节，造成许多教育工作中的人为障碍；学生呢，不仅不能从自己的教师那里学得应该能够学到的知识、技术，反而从自己的教师那里得到些极不应该得到的剥削阶级思想意识的薰染。祖国的人民，乃至于每一个真诚愿意为祖国、为人民服务的教师，都将不再容许这种现象继续存在。
    刘少奇同志在谈到无产阶级对待自己同志的态度时，说：“他们（指无产阶级——笔者注）想发展自己，抬高自己，但是他们必须同时发展别人，抬高整个劳动阶级的地位，才能使自己抬高。他们在思想上、政治上、工作上不甘落于人后，而有极高的努力前进的心理，但他们必须尊敬、爱护与帮助在这些方面强过他们的人，而努力向他们学习，绝无嫉妒之心。”用无产阶级思想改造自己，不能是，而且也不应该只是一句空话。在改正其它错误思想的同时，怎样自觉地、积极地纠正这种由于存在于自己灵魂深处的剥削阶级思想意识所招致的同志间的各种不正确的关系，也是教师们自我思想改造的一个重要课题！
