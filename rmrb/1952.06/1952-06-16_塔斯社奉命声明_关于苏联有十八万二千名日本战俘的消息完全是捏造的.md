Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: TASS, Moscow, June 13th: Japanese newspapers, based on information supposedly obtained from Mrs. Takara Tomi, a member of the Japanese Diet who recently visited the Soviet Union, are spreading rumors that Mrs. Takara Tomi learned that if the Soviet Union and Japan conclude a separate peace treaty, the Soviet Union is prepared to repatriate 182,000 Japanese prisoners of war who are claimed to be detained in the Soviet Union.

TASS is authorized to state that this news is a complete fabrication.

During Mrs. Takara Tomi's stay in the Soviet Union, the issue of concluding a separate peace treaty with Japan was never discussed, nor was the issue of Japanese prisoners of war.

The rumor spread by Japanese newspapers that there are 182,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union is a common attempt to mislead Japanese public opinion. From the officially published statements of the Soviet Union, it is known that only 1,487 Japanese prisoners of war who were convicted of war crimes remain in the Soviet Union and have not been repatriated.

    塔斯社奉命声明
    关于苏联有十八万二千名日本战俘的消息完全是捏造的
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：日本报纸根据据说是从不久前曾来苏联访问的日本国会议员高良富夫人那里得来的消息，散布谣言说：据高良富夫人获悉，一旦苏联和日本缔结一项单独和约，苏联准备遣返十八万二千名硬说是被扣在苏联的日本战俘。
    塔斯社奉命声明：这种消息完全是捏造的。
    在高良富夫人逗留苏联期间，从未谈判过和日本缔结单独和约的问题，也从未谈判过日本战俘的问题。
    日本报纸所散布的说在苏联有十八万二千名日本战俘的谣言，是一种常见的迷惑日本舆论的企图。从苏联正式公布的声明中，人们知道，只有一千四百八十七名因他们的战争罪行而被定罪的日本战俘尚留在苏联没有遣返。
