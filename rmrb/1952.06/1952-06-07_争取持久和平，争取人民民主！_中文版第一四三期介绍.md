The Chinese edition, No. 143, of the Cominform's journal "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue contains excerpts from the report of the "Investigative Group on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" organized by various Chinese people's organizations, exposing the truth about the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare in Korea. The editorial in this issue is entitled "Communist Press Struggles for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism." Other important articles in this issue include: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "The Great Construction Projects of Communism in the Soviet Union"; Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, "Striving for Peace is Striving for Survival"; Viliam Široký, Chairman of the Communist Party of Slovakia, "Fraternal Cooperation Between the Czech and Slovak Nations in the Czechoslovak Republic"; James Klugmann, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, "The Growing Crisis of Imperialist Colonial System"; and Popiwoda's "The People of Yugoslavia Will Surely Return Their Motherland to the Camp of Democracy and Socialism," etc.

The editorial in this issue states: The newspapers and periodicals of the Communist and Workers' Parties are the most effective and powerful weapons of the Party, and their role and tasks are extremely important in the current struggle between the two camps. The strength of the Communist press lies in its close and unbreakable ties with the people, with the broad masses of working people; because it represents the truth, constantly and correctly reflects the vital interests of the workers and all working people, and consistently struggles for these interests. Because of its close ties with the masses and its struggle for the interests of the people, the Communist press enjoys a very high prestige among a wide range of people from all walks of life. The editorial then describes the outstanding contributions of the Soviet "Pravda," the Chinese "People's Daily," the newspapers and periodicals of the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, Korea, the German Democratic Republic, France, and Italy, as well as the Communist and Workers' Parties in other capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries. The editorial concludes: However, there are often shortcomings in the various organs of the Communist and Workers' Parties; these shortcomings are often manifested in the lack of combativeness in the content, insufficient contact with the broad readership, or insufficiently sharp condemnation of U.S. imperialism, the inability to publicize the achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in a lively and vivid style, and the inability to explain the basic issues of Marxist-Leninist theory, the working-class movement, and the struggle for peace to the masses thoroughly and in detail, etc. In the People's Democratic countries, some newspapers have failed to adequately explore ideological issues and intra-party issues, have not paid deep attention to the development of economic life, and have not attached enough importance to criticism and self-criticism and raising the revolutionary vigilance of the masses. The constant, concrete, and in-depth leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties over the press will help to correct the shortcomings that have occurred in some Party newspapers, improve the level of the Communist press, and make them more powerful weapons in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Dej's article states: The development of productive forces for peaceful construction is a fatal danger to capitalist countries. The planned and step-by-step utilization of natural resources is necessary, but only possible under the conditions of socialist construction. Dej's article then compares the Soviet Union's transformation of nature, turning barren land into fertile land, with the situation in capitalist countries such as the United States, where fertile land is gradually turning into barren land. Dej said: On the one hand, capitalists use science—the results of many years of thought, experience, and labor—mainly to create tools of weapons condemned by all mankind; on the other hand, Soviet science and technology are serving the lofty goal of building communism. The peace fighters of the world resolutely declare that they will never fight against countries building communism.

Ibárruri's article states: The question of peace or war is a matter of life and death for all countries and all honest people. Millions of people are increasingly aware that the imperialist aggression plan is the root cause of the war crisis, and unless the people of all countries work together to stop it, the arms race directed by the United States and its vassal states will cause serious disasters.

Široký's article described how the reactionary rule of Czechoslovakia in the past caused the division between the two fraternal nations of Czechs and Slovaks and the unity of the two fraternal nations after liberation. Široký said: The new constitution of the People's Democratic Czechoslovakia clearly stipulates the equal status of the Czech and Slovak peoples. However, we cannot be satisfied with the formal equality achieved by the Slovak people. Comrade Stalin taught us that the victorious proletariat of advanced countries should provide practical and long-term assistance to the cultural and economic development of the laboring masses of backward nations. According to Stalin's instructions, the industrialization of Slovakia has become one of the main tasks of socialist construction in the Czechoslovak Republic. Široký's article then introduced the great achievements Slovakia has made in economic and cultural aspects in the years since liberation.

Klugmann's article states: The crisis of the imperialist colonial system, caused by the vigorous development of the liberation movements of the peoples of colonies and dependencies, has developed to an unprecedented scale and has now become the main factor determining the overall world situation. At present, all wars waged by imperialist countries are wars against the liberation struggles of the peoples of colonies and dependencies, or wars to conquer countries that were formerly dependencies and have now gained freedom. All the increasingly serious economic and political problems in the capitalist world today are related to this growing crisis of the colonial system. Klugmann continued: As the overseas military obligations and the burden of war of the imperialist countries increase, so do the difficulties they encounter in their already weakened economy and available manpower and material resources. The methods used by imperialism to deal with the crisis of the colonial system can only deepen the crisis and at the same time aggravate domestic problems and sharpen the contradictions between imperialist countries. Klugmann concluded: In colonial countries, as long as an effective national united front is established, an alliance between the working class and the peasantry is established, and as long as there is a developing and politically mature Communist Party that can play a leading role in the national liberation struggle of their people, the greatest victory can be achieved.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四三期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四三期已经出版。
    本期刊载了我国各人民团体组织的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”揭露美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战真相的报告书的摘要。本期社论题为“共产主义报刊为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争”。本期其他的重要文章有：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记波克的“苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程”；西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽的“争取和平就是争取生存”；斯洛伐克共产党主席西罗基的“捷克斯洛伐克共和国的捷克和斯洛伐克两民族的兄弟合作”；英国共产党副主席杜德的“帝国主义殖民制度的危机日益增长”和波皮沃达的“南斯拉夫人民必将使他们的祖国回到民主与社会主义阵营”等。
    本期的社论说：共产党和工人党的报刊是党的最有效和最有力的武器，在现阶段两个阵营的斗争中，它的作用和任务实在是异常重大的。共产党的报刊之所以具有力量，是因为它与人民、与广大的劳动人民群众有密切的牢不可破的联系；因为它代表真理，经常地正确地反映工人们和全体劳动人民的切身利益，并一贯地为这些利益而奋斗。由于和群众有密切联系并为人民群众的利益而斗争，共产党的报刊在广泛的各阶层人民中享有非常崇高的威信。社论接着叙述了苏联的“真理报”、中国的“人民日报”、东欧人民民主国家、朝鲜、德意志民主共和国、法国和意大利以及其他资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的共产党和工人党报刊的卓越贡献。社论最后说：但是，共产党和工人党的各种机关报刊，还常常存在着缺点；这些缺点，时常表现在内容的缺乏战斗性、与广大的读者联系不够，或谴责美帝国主义不够尖锐，不能够以生动鲜明的风格来宣传苏联和人民民主国家的成就，不能够透澈详尽地向群众解释马克思—列宁主义理论、工人阶级运动以及争取和平的斗争的基本问题，等等。在人民民主国家，某些报刊没有能够恰当地探讨思想问题和党内的问题，没有深刻地注意经济生活的发展，也没有足够地重视批评与自我批评和提高群众的革命警惕性。共产党和工人党对报刊予以经常地、具体而深入地领导，将有助于改正某些党报所发生的缺点，提高共产党报刊的水平，使它们在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中成为更有力的武器。
    波克的文章说：发展生产力以进行和平建设，对资本主义国家说来是一个致命的危险。有计划地有步骤地利用天然财富是必要的，但只有在社会主义建设的条件下才有可能。波克的文章接着对比了苏联改造自然变荒地为沃土而资本主义国家如美国等却使沃土逐渐变为荒地的情形。波克说：一方面资本家利用科学——许多年代的思想、经验和劳动的成果——主要是用来制造为全人类所斥责的武器的工具，另一方面苏联的科学和技术，正为建设共产主义的崇高目标而服务。全世界的和平战士们坚决地表示永远不对建设共产主义的国家作战。
    伊巴露丽的文章说：和平或战争的问题，对于一切国家、一切正直的人们是一个生死存亡的问题。千千万万的人日益认识帝国主义的侵略计划是战争危机的祸根，除非各国人民协力阻止，美国指使它的附庸国家进行的扩充军备的竞赛，就会造成严重的灾难。
    西罗基的文章叙述了由于捷克斯洛伐克过去的反动统治造成了捷克和斯洛伐克两个兄弟民族的分裂以及解放后两个兄弟民族团结一致的情形。西罗基说：人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克新宪法明确规定了捷克和斯洛伐克两族人民的平等地位。但是，我们不可能满足于斯洛伐克人民取得的形式上的平等。斯大林同志教导我们说：先进国家的胜利的无产阶级，对于落后民族劳动大众的文化和经济发展，应该给予实际的长期的援助。根据斯大林的指示，斯洛伐克的工业化成了捷克斯洛伐克共和国的社会主义建设的主要任务之一。西罗基的文章接着介绍了斯洛伐克在解放后几年来在经济和文化等方面已获得的巨大成就。
    杜德的文章说：由于殖民地与附属国人民解放运动的蓬勃开展而产生的帝国主义殖民制度的危机，已经发展到了空前的规模，而且现在已经成为决定整个世界局势的主要因素。目前，帝国主义国家所进行的一切战争都是反对殖民地与附属国人民的解放斗争的战争，或者是为了征服从前是附属国、而现在已经获得自由的国家而进行的战争。目前资本主义世界中一切日益严重的经济与政治问题，都是与殖民制度的这种日益增涨的危机有关联的。杜德接着说：由于帝国主义国家的海外军事义务和战争的负担日渐加重，它们在已经削弱的经济和可用的人力物力方面所遭到的困难也就随之增加了。帝国主义用来对付殖民制度危机的方法所产生的效果，只可能使危机加深，同时使国内问题更加严重，使帝国主义国家间的矛盾更尖锐化。杜德最后说：在殖民地国家里面，只要那里建立了有效的民族统一战线，建立了工人阶级与农民的联盟，只要那里有发展的和政治上成熟的共产党能够在它们人民的民族解放斗争中起领导作用，那里就能够获得最伟大的胜利。            （新华社）
