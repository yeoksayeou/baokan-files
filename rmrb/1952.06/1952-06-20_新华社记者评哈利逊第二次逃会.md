Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 19th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: Harrison walked away from the negotiating table again on the 17th – his second walkout in ten days, which proves once again that the U.S. side is unwilling to continue the armistice negotiations. Harrison abruptly announced a recess today, saying there was "nothing more to be done," and walked away from the negotiating table without listening to General Nam Il's response. He has once again shown that the U.S. side intends to use a long recess to stifle the negotiations. He said he plans to return on or after June 21, but not before. General Nam Il firmly advocated continuing normal negotiations to try to resolve the last remaining obstacle to a Korean armistice.

This second provocative act by the U.S. side aimed at sabotaging the negotiations strongly demonstrates that the U.S. side is unwilling to resolve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation through negotiation. It is obvious that the U.S. side's refusal to seek a fair solution through negotiation has brought the negotiations to a complete standstill. If one side refuses to negotiate and insists that the other side accept its terms at the negotiating table, progress is impossible.

Harrison threatened: "Unless you are now prepared to accept our proposal, I suggest a recess until June 21." This is clearly a gangster's tactic. In Harrison's view, accepting the U.S. demand to tear up the Geneva Convention and prevent prisoners of war from returning home to a peaceful life is "doing serious business," while anything else is "absurd propaganda" and means there is "nothing more to be done."

For many days, General Nam Il has patiently reminded Harrison: "I remind you that what you cannot get on the battlefield, you will not get at the conference table. Your naive behavior will not have any impact on our side and will only delay the realization of an armistice." Ten days ago, Harrison walked away from the negotiating table for three days. Harrison's refusal to return to Panmunjom, besides showing the United States' intention to prolong the bloodshed and suffering in Korea, has no other impact on the negotiations.

Observers here believe that the reason Harrison took the ridiculous action of walking out of the Panmunjom meeting is that he took over the "unenviable" task from Joy of carrying out Washington's orders. These American generals fought a few battles on the battlefield, and after the failure of their offensives in the summer and autumn of last year, they were forced to return to the negotiating table. Now their only skill is to walk out of meetings and then run back after being condemned by the masses. Now, even the so-called "logic and reason" that American representatives love to flaunt to the world have been exhausted. Now they can only say "this is final," and then run away.

Observers here point out that Harrison's attempt to unilaterally decide the terms of the armistice at the negotiating table is bound to lead to an even greater defeat for Washington. Harrison's crude means of abruptly interrupting the negotiation meeting will achieve nothing and will only further expose the American intention to continue the war and endanger peace in the Far East. There are two paths before him: either return to the negotiating table and negotiate on an equal footing, or bear the responsibility for openly sabotaging the negotiations. Because their proposals are "firm, final, and unchangeable," the American representatives now face this "unenviable" predicament.

### 新华社记者评哈利逊第二次逃会

    新华社记者评哈利逊第二次逃会
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊十七日又从会议桌旁逃走——这是十天以来他第二次逃会，这又一次证明美方不愿继续进行停战谈判。哈利逊今天突然片面宣布休会，说“再没有事情可做”，他没有听取南日将军的答复就从会议桌旁逃走。他又一次表明美方居心用长期休会的办法扼杀谈判。他说，他打算在六月二十一日或这一天以后回来，而不打算在这一天以前回来。南日将军坚决主张继续进行正常的谈判，设法解决妨碍朝鲜停战的最后一个问题。
    美方这种企图破坏谈判的第二次挑衅，强烈表明美方不肯通过谈判解决遣返战俘问题。显而易见，美方这种拒绝通过谈判求得公平解决的态度，已使谈判完全陷入僵局。如果一方拒绝谈判，硬要对方在会议桌上接受它的条件的话，谈判是不可能取得进展的。
    哈利逊威胁说：“除非你们现在准备接受我们的建议，否则我建议休会至六月二十一日再开。”这显然是匪徒的手腕。在哈利逊看来，接受美方所提的撕毁日内瓦公约的要求，不让战俘回家过和平生活，这倒是“做正经事”，不这样就是“荒谬的宣传”，就“再没有事情可做”。
    许多天以来，南日将军一直耐心地提醒哈利逊道：“我提醒你，在战场上得不到的东西在会议上同样得不到。你方这种幼稚的行径绝不会对我方有任何影响，只能延缓停战的实现。”十天前，哈利逊从会议桌旁逃走了三天。哈利逊拒绝回到板门店来，这除了表明美国居心延长朝鲜的流血和痛苦以外，对谈判别无其他影响。
    此地观察家认为，哈利逊所以做出逃开板门店会议的可笑行动，是由于他接替了乔埃留给他的执行华盛顿命令这种“无可羡慕”的差使。这些美国将军们曾经到战场上打了几仗，在去年夏秋两季攻势失败之后，才被迫回到会议桌边来。现在他们的本事只是逃开会议，在遭到群众的谴责之后再跑回来。现在就连美国代表们爱向世界搬弄的所谓“逻辑和道理”，也都讲完了。现在他们只能说一句“这是最后的”，说完就逃跑。
    此地观察家指出：哈利逊妄想独自在会议桌上片面决定停战条款，这种企图最后必使华盛顿遭到更大的失败。哈利逊粗暴地宣布中断谈判会议的手段，达不到任何目的，只能招致更加暴露美国想要继续战争和危害远东和平的意图。有两条路摆在他面前：要么回到会议桌边来在平等的基础上进行谈判，要不就承担公然破坏谈判的责任。由于他们的建议是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”，美国代表这时就得面对这个“无可羡慕的”窘境。
