Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Tokyo: Eight hundred thousand Japanese workers staged another major strike on the 17th. This strike is the second phase of the third general strike against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" and against the revision of labor regulations. The first phase of the strike was held on June 7th, with 700,000 workers participating at that time.

The 800,000 workers participating in the strike on the 17th belong to fourteen unions including electrical industry, coal mines, metal mines, and shipbuilding. According to the Associated Press, the electrical industry workers' eight-hour strike resulted in a loss of 1,673,000 kilowatts of electricity, accounting for approximately 23 percent of Japan's daily power generation. Members of unions in government and financial institutions supported the strike by holding rallies. Coinciding with the workers' general strike, students at thirty-one universities across the country went on strike.

Workers and students also held protest rallies across the country to oppose the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." According to police authorities, rallies were held in seventy-one locations nationwide. According to union authorities, a total of more than two million workers and students participated in rallies supporting the strike. In Tokyo, despite the authorities' prohibition and obstruction, a general mobilization rally of workers, citizens, and students from all of Tokyo was held at Tokyo University.

The Yoshida government is evidently panicked in the face of the Japanese people's unyielding struggle, and police across the country have been ordered to be on alert. Tokyo police suppressed workers and students and arrested thirteen people. In Kyoto, workers and students held a demonstration march after a rally against the Yoshida government's fascist policies. Police barbarically used tear gas to disperse the demonstration, injuring many demonstrators and arresting forty people. Prior to this, Tokyo police also clashed with workers and students protesting the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" on the 16th, arresting three people afterward. Teachers and students in Osaka held a rally and demonstration on the 15th to oppose the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," and the police unreasonably arrested twelve students.

Japanese workers will continue to persist in their strike struggle. Private railway, textile, and seafarers' unions, among others, are scheduled to strike on June 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Vienna: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which closed in Vienna on the 14th, adopted a letter to working people of all countries to support the just struggle of the German and Japanese people for independence and democracy, stating: Working men and women! The WFTU specifically points out that the warmongers want to continue to maintain the division of Germany, revive German fascism and Japanese militarism, in order to plunge the people of all countries into a new bloody massacre, and therefore specifically calls on you to pay attention to the sinister schemes of these warmongers.

The militarization of West Germany and Japan is being carried out under the direction of the American imperialists, with the aim of turning these two countries into springboards for launching aggression in Europe and the Far East once again. The WFTU calls on working people around the world to support the German and Japanese people, to support their struggle to win national independence, freedom, and democracy, and to oppose the imperialists' plans to remilitarize their countries.

It is the responsibility of us working people around the world to stop the warmongers' heinous plans, to stop their new bloody schemes against humanity. If we are united and steadfast in this common struggle, we will surely achieve victory. The WFTU specifically calls on the working people of those countries that are about to consider ratifying the military "General Treaty" to rise up in active protest, demanding the cancellation and abolition of this treaty. The WFTU expresses its respect for the German and Japanese working people who are fighting against the remilitarization of their countries and thus demonstrating their unwavering will for international peace.

Down with the military "General Treaty" forced upon West Germany by the warmongers! Long live a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany! Down with the military agreement between the American imperialists and Japanese militarists! Long live a peace-loving, independent, and democratic Japan! Long live world peace!

    日本八十万工人再次罢工反对法西斯法案
    二百多万工人和学生举行抗议集会和示威声援罢工工人
    世界工联执行局号召劳动人民支援德国和日本人民的斗争
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：日本八十万工人在十七日再一次举行大罢工。这次罢工是反对“防止破坏活动法案”和反对修改劳工法规的第三次总罢工的第二阶段的罢工，第一阶段的罢工是在六月七日举行的，当时参加的有七十万工人。
    参加十七日大罢工的八十万工人分属于电气产业、煤矿、金属矿山、造船等十四个工会。据美联社讯，电气产业工人的八小时罢工，使电力损失了一百六十七万三千瓩，约占日本每日发电量的百分之二十三。政府机关和金融机关等工会的会员，以举行大会的方式支援罢工。配合着工人的总罢工，全国三十一所大学的学生举行了罢课。
    工人和学生并在全国各地举行抗议大会，反对“防止破坏活动法案”。据警察当局的消息，全国共有七十一处举行集会。据工会当局说，参加声援罢工的大会的工人和学生共有二百多万人。在东京，人们不顾当局的禁止和阻挠，在东京大学举行了全东京工人、市民、学生总奋起大会。
    吉田政府显然在日本人民的不屈不挠的斗争面前感到恐慌，全国警察都奉命出动戒备。东京警察曾对工人和学生进行镇压，并逮捕了十三个人。在京都，工人和学生在举行了反对吉田政府的法西斯政策的大会之后，开始了示威游行。警察野蛮地用催泪弹来驱散示威队伍，示威者多人受伤，四十人被捕。在此以前，东京警察在十六日也曾与抗议“防止破坏活动法案”的工人与学生发生冲突，事后逮捕了三个人。大阪的教员和学生曾在十五日举行大会和示威，反对“防止破坏活动法案”，警察无理逮捕了十二个学生。
    日本工人将继续坚持罢工斗争。私营铁道、纺织、海员工会等，已定于六月二十日举行罢工。
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：十四日在维也纳闭幕的世界工会联合会执行局会议通过为支持德国和日本人民争取独立与民主的正义斗争告各国劳动人民书说：男女劳动者们！世界工联特别指出，战争贩子们要继续保持德国的分裂，复活德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义，以图把各国人民投入新的血腥大屠杀中，因此特别号召你们注意这些战争贩子们的罪恶阴谋。
    西德和日本的军国主义化已在美帝国主义者的指使之下进行，其目的是要把这两个国家再次变成在欧洲和远东发动侵略的跳板。世界工联号召全世界劳动人民支援德国和日本人民，支持他们争取本国独立、自由和民主以及反对帝国主义者使他们本国重新军国主义化的计划的斗争。
    我们全世界劳动人民有责任去制止战争贩子罪恶滔天的计划，制止他们的反人类的新的血腥阴谋。如果我们在这共同的斗争中团结一致，信心坚定，我们就一定能够取得胜利。世界工联特别号召那些马上就要考虑批准军事性的“一般性条约”的国家的劳动人民起来进行积极的抗议，要求取消和废除这个条约。世界工联对正在为反对他们本国重新军国主义化而斗争、因而表现了他们对国际和平不可动摇的意志的德国和日本劳动人民，表示敬意。
    打倒战争贩子迫使西德接受的军事性“一般性条约”！统一的、爱好和平的与民主的德国万岁！打倒美帝国主义者和日本军国主义者间的军事协定！爱好和平的、独立的与民主的日本万岁！世界和平万岁！
