    The "Five-Anti" Movement in Wuhan has basically concluded. Among the more than 40,000 industrial and commercial households in the city, except for a few industries such as private banks, money shops, commission agents, and shipping, where the movement started later, 38,135 households have been settled. At present, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government is vigorously leading private industrialists and businessmen to actively restore and develop production and invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.
    During the "Five-Anti" Movement in Wuhan, due to the passive and wait-and-see attitude of some industrialists and businessmen towards management, coupled with the temporary suspension of processing orders from some state organs to private enterprises, and the off-season in some industries, the market temporarily experienced sluggish sales. In the later stage of the "Five-Anti" Movement, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, in response to the concerns of industrialists and businessmen, held various meetings to conduct ideological education, explain policies, and encourage private industrialists and businessmen to engage in legitimate business after removing the "five poisons." At the same time, it also took care of the actual difficulties in some industries. State-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies, grain companies, department stores, and other units have resumed processing commissions for more than 300 factories in nine industries, including weaving, spinning, dyeing and finishing, flour milling, rice milling, knitting, pharmaceuticals, canvas, and oil extraction. The Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China promptly provided a large number of loans, and as of June 10, it had lent 91.3 billion yuan, of which 20 billion yuan was lent at one time to ten industries in Wuhan that participated in the East China urban and rural material exchange conference. In order to facilitate loans for private industrialists and businessmen, the bank also tried to simplify loan procedures as much as possible. In addition, many state-owned economic departments also purchased a large amount of stockpiled materials from private industrialists and businessmen.
    While state-owned economic departments vigorously supported private industrialists and businessmen, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held various meetings to educate workers and shop assistants in private enterprises, calling on them to actively unite with the capitalists to improve production. At present, various industries are holding industry-wide labor-management consultation meetings to discuss how to develop production and business in their respective industries. The results of the consultations are generally satisfactory, so the new labor-management relations are beginning to normalize. After the labor-management consultation meetings, the workers in many factories are more actively trying to increase the output and quality of their products. For example, the Qinlao Weaving Factory used to weave 36.7 pieces of cloth per yarn, but now it has increased to 37 pieces. The employees of Hanxin Machine-Woven Canvas Factory have improved their weaving technology, and their products can now meet the standard of being waterproof and not damp for a day and a night.
    Under the inspiration of the specific assistance of the People's Government and the active production of employees, many industrialists and businessmen have begun to actively manage their businesses, some increasing capital and some formulating business plans. In late May, ten industries, including native products, groceries, grain, paper, department stores, silk fabrics, hardware, electrical appliances, and cultural and educational supplies, sent representatives to participate in the East China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference, and enthusiastically purchased and sold goods at the conference. Native product merchants are also actively engaged in transactions. In May, the transaction volume of seven kinds of native products in Wuhan, including *bangzi*, tobacco leaves, raw silk, sugar, wood ears, daylily, and red dates, increased by an average of 150% compared with April, most of which were transactions conducted by private merchants. Many native product firms sent procurement teams to the producing areas to purchase native products and set up more *waizhuang*. Most of the import and export merchants have formulated purchase and sale plans. Fuli, Xinzhong, and other trading firms made transactions of more than 1.76 billion yuan with the Industrial Equipment Company at one time. Hongxing Wood Machine Weaving Factory has been converted to electric motor production, and the capitalists of Lihua Weaving Factory have also invested 50 million yuan to repair the factory buildings.
    Facts have proved that as long as private industrialists and businessmen engage in legitimate business and no longer commit the "five poisons," they have broad prospects for development. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Xinhua News Agency: The "Five-Anti" Movement in Chongqing has basically concluded. 99% of the illegal industrial and commercial households in the city have been dealt with, and the focus of work has shifted to large-scale restoration and development of production. The "Five-Anti" Movement in Chongqing lasted four and a half months from February this year to the present and has achieved a complete victory. More than 80% of the city's employees were mobilized in the movement, their awareness was raised, and more than 310,000 pieces of illegal materials were reported and urged by the capitalists, initially achieving the goal of eliminating the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists.
    In order to quickly restore and develop production and consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Five-Anti," the Chongqing Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Inspection Committee and the Municipal People's Government Industrial and Commercial Bureau have held a series of industrial and commercial symposiums and representative meetings before and after the end of the movement to further educate the capitalists, point out the future, and encourage them to continue to transform through active management. In order to take care of the restoration and development of business for many industrial and commercial households, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Inspection Committee has decided to postpone the payment of supplementary taxes and refunds to batches after September this year and continue to expand the number and types of loans and processing orders. By May, the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China had released 70 billion yuan in loans. It will increase in June. In May alone, the amount of processing orders handled by the state-owned Chongqing Trust Company increased by more than doubled compared with April, and the scope of assistance covered 34 industries, with more than 2,000 industrial and commercial households accepting processing orders one after another. The first batch of orders signed by the Industry Department Management Office of the Southwest Military and Political Committee to the Chongqing Iron and Steel Machinery Industry also reached more than 90 types. At the same time, labor-management consultation meetings and "Five-Anti" summary meetings were held throughout the city, and employees promoted the capitalists to actively restore business, research and improve business. Various state-owned companies also separately invited capitalists to hold discussions to provide assistance for their specific difficulties. The Southwest District Native Products Company has purchased more than 10,000 kilograms of unsalable green hemp from the mountain goods industry in Chongqing and organized private merchants to purchase it in the producing areas, solving their problem of shortage of funds.
    After these efforts, the city's private industry and commerce are gradually moving towards restoration, and the output of some industries has exceeded the level before the "Five-Anti" Movement. For example, the number of looms started in the native cloth industry in April broke the highest record since liberation, and the output of various cloths in May increased by 25.4% compared with April. Due to the support of the People's Government and the driving force of industrial recovery, commerce has further become active. In May, the transaction amount of the main markets for grain and mountain goods in the city increased by an average of 12.05% compared with April. Some commodities that were previously unsalable have begun to become bestsellers. Private industrialists and businessmen have gradually shifted from passive and wait-and-see to actively improving and expanding their business. Some of those who stopped business due to a lack of understanding of the policy are also actively demanding resumption of business. In May, more than 100 new factories and shops were added in the city. General manufacturers have begun to change their business style, costs have generally been reduced, and product quality has gradually improved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武汉重庆“五反”运动基本结束
    武汉市“五反”运动已基本结束。全市四万多工商户中，除运动开展较迟的私营银行、钱庄、行商、航运等少数行业外，其余三万八千一百三十五户均已定案。目前武汉市人民政府正大力领导私营工商业者积极恢复和发展生产，活跃城乡物资交流。
    武汉市在“五反”运动中，由于部分工商业者对经营抱消极观望的态度，加之部分国家机关给私营企业的加工定货暂时停止，某些行业处于淡季，市场曾暂时出现滞销现象。“五反”运动后期，武汉市人民政府针对工商业者的顾虑，召开了各种会议进行思想教育，交代政策，鼓励私营工商业者在去除“五毒”后从事正当经营，同时对某些行业的实际困难又加以照顾。国营花纱布公司、粮食公司、百货公司等单位，对织布、纺织、染整、面粉、碾米、针织、制药、帆布、榨油等九个行业的三百多家工厂恢复了加工委托。中国人民银行武汉分行及时贷出大批款项，截至六月十日已贷出九百一十三亿元，其中一次贷给武汉市参加华东区城乡物资交流大会的十个行业即达二百亿元。为便于私营工商业者贷款，该行并尽量设法简化了贷款手续。此外，许多国营经济部门也大量收购私营工商业者的积压物资。
    在国营经济部门大力扶助私营工商业的同时，武汉市总工会召开各种会议向私营企业中的工人店员进行教育，号召他们主动团结资方搞好生产。目前各行业正分别召开全行业性的劳资协商会议，讨论如何发展本行本业的生产和营业问题。协商结果一般都比较圆满，因此新的劳资关系开始趋向正常。许多工厂的工人在劳资协商会后，更积极设法提高产品的产量和质量。如勤劳织布厂过去每件纱织布三十六点七匹，现在提高到三十七匹。汉新机织帆布厂的职工提高织布技术，出品现在已可达到覆水不漏、一日一夜不泛潮的标准。
    许多工商业者在人民政府具体扶助和职工积极生产的感召下，开始积极经营，有的增加资金，有的制订营业计划。五月下旬，土产、杂货、粮食、纸张、百货、绸布、五金、电器、文教用品等十个行业都推派代表参加了华东区城乡物资交流大会，并在会上踊跃购销物品。土产商也积极进行交易。五月份武汉市棓子、烟叶、生丝、食糖、木耳、黄花菜、红枣等七种土产的成交量平均较四月份增加了一倍半，其中绝大部分是私商进行的交易。许多土产行派出采购组往产地收购土产，并增设了外庄。进出口商大部分订出了购销计划。富利、新中等贸易行一次即和工业器材公司作成了十七亿六千多万元的交易。洪兴木机织布厂已改成电机生产，利华织布厂资方也投资五千万元修理厂房。
    事实证明：私营工商业者只要从事正当经营、不再犯“五毒”，是有广阔的发展前途的。（新华社）
    重庆市“五反”运动基本结束。全市违法工商户已有百分之九十九处理完毕，工作重点已转到大规模恢复和发展生产。重庆市“五反”运动从今年二月开始到目前止，历时四个半月，已获全胜。全市职工有百分之八十以上在运动中发动起来，觉悟提高，检举和督促资方交代违法材料达三十一万多件，初步达到清除不法资本家“五毒”的目的。
    为了迅速恢复和发展生产，巩固“五反”胜利成果，重庆市增产节约检查委员会和市人民政府工商局，已在运动结束前后召开一系列工商座谈会、代表会等，进一步对资本家进行教育，指明前途，鼓励他们从积极经营中继续改造。为照顾许多工商户恢复和发展业务，市增产节约检查委员会已决定把补税退款推迟到今年九月以后分批交清，并继续扩大贷款、加工定货数量和种类。中国人民银行重庆分行到五月份为止，已放出贷款七百亿元。六月份还将增加。五月份仅国营重庆信托公司经办的加工定货金额，就比四月份增加一倍多，扶助面遍及三十四个行业，先后接受加工定货的工商户有二千多家。西南军政委员会工业部经理处向重庆市钢铁机器业签订的首批定货，也达九十多种。与此同时，全市普遍召开劳资协商会、“五反”总结会等，职工们推动资方积极恢复营业，研究和改进业务。各国营公司也分别邀集资本家座谈，针对他们的具体困难，予以扶助。西南区土产公司已收购重庆市山货业滞销青麻一万多斤，并组织私商到产地收购，解决了他们资金短少的困难。
    经过这些工作，全市私营工商业正逐步走向恢复，有些工业的产量已超过“五反”运动前水平。如土布业四月份开工机台数已打破解放以来最高纪录，五月份各种布匹的产量较四月份又增加百分之二十五点四。由于人民政府的扶助和工业恢复的带动，商业也进一步活跃。全市粮食、山货各主要市场，五月份交易金额比四月份平均增加百分之十二点零五。有些过去滞销的商品已开始转为畅销。私营工商业者已由消极、观望陆续转向积极改进和扩大业务。有些原来对政策不了解而停业的，也积极要求复业。五月份全市新增加工厂商店一百多家。一般厂商已开始转变经营作风，成本普遍降低，产品质量逐步提高。（新华社）
