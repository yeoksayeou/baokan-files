Economic Briefs

    ▲A large quantity of new wheat has been put on the market in Shandong Province. The state-owned Shandong Provincial Grain Company and cooperatives are purchasing it on a large scale, with daily purchases reaching two million jin in the major wheat-producing areas of Xuzhou and Changwei. This year, in the wheat purchasing work, the state-owned grain company and cooperatives, in addition to setting up purchasing stations for purchasing, are also paying attention to adopting the experience of mobile teams going to the countryside to purchase cotton last year, purchasing on the one hand and supplying farmers with daily necessities on the other.
    ▲In order to supply the needs of cooperative members during the busy farming season and to avoid affecting the summer harvest work, the Xinzhu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Chang'an County formed a busy farming season delivery team as early as May 29th. The busy farming season delivery team consists of four people who push two handcarts full of daily necessities such as Luyan salt, white sugar, matches, and tobacco, delivering goods to cooperative members village by village. As of June 5th, the team had traveled to all thirteen townships in the district, some townships even twice, with total sales reaching more than 4 million yuan, equivalent to more than half of the sales volume of the retail department.
    ▲Most of the more than 30 fine yarn teams from state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai that challenged the Hao Jianxiu team have completed or exceeded their planned targets for the first month (May) after the challenge. The Jiang Linmei team of the State-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory achieved a 23-count yarn output of 0.519 pounds per spindle in May, an increase of 0.33 percent compared to the challenge plan.
