　　West Gou Village Masses in Ping Shun, Shanxi Province Emphasize Substitute Farming Work
　　Editor: The substitute farming work in West Gou Village, Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province is done very well. Last year, the average yield per mu of substitute farmed land was 375 jin, exceeding the pre-war level by 106 percent. This year, under the slogan of "Guarantee increased production for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers," all the village's farmers have launched a patriotic substitute farming competition, demanding a further increase of 40 jin per mu of substitute farmed land (the general masses plan to increase production by 35 jin per mu), and have drawn up specific plans for spring plowing and sowing. As of May 15, the spring plowing and sowing work on the village's substitute farmed land had been successfully completed and the plan overfulfilled. The land they substitute farm is plowed, rolled, and harrowed three times; 110 dan of fertilizer are applied per mu, exceeding the plan by 5 dan (i.e., exceeding the general masses by 5 dan); in addition, they built 65 collapsed embankments for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, exceeding the plan by 21; the original plan was to complete sowing before the Beginning of Summer, but it was completed five days ahead of schedule.
　　The reason why the substitute farming work in West Gou Village is done well is mainly because the village people's government strengthened political education for the masses, first leading the masses to study "Who are the Most Beloved People" and documents on opposing American bacteriological warfare. The masses realized that doing a good job in substitute farming work is supporting the "most beloved people." In addition, the village strengthened the leadership of the preferential treatment committee, promptly inspected the substitute farming work, and cultivated substitute farming models and model families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. These are also reasons for doing a good job in substitute farming work.

　　Suggestion to Contract Substitute Farmed Land to Mutual Aid Teams
　　Editor: This year, West Dian Village in the 10th District of Beijing has begun to contract substitute farmed land for military families to mutual aid teams, and the effect is very good. There are 37 military families in the village, and 6 households need substitute farming, totaling 50 mu. These lands are all contracted to mutual aid teams for farming. Throughout the year, each mu of land is contracted for 5 workdays, with each workday yielding 12.5 jin of corn. The mutual aid team guarantees that there will be no weeds in the field and that the yield will exceed that of the mutual aid team's own land. Ji Luyou, a military family, has 6 mu of land contracted to the Han Changhua mutual aid team for substitute farming. The team included a clause in its patriotic production increase plan: "Give priority to military families for any work in the field, and guarantee that the yield exceeds that of each team member." Grandpa Ji, a member of a military family, said: "The mutual aid team does a good job, making the land both drought-resistant and flood-resistant; we are also worry-free, without having to send tea and food; the yield is guaranteed, much better than finding someone to farm it." Gao Beidian military families need substitute farming for 60 mu of land and are also planning to contract it to mutual aid teams. I think it is a good method to contract the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers without labor to mutual aid teams. I suggest that all localities consider adopting this method.

　　Qin Yuan Ma Sen Village Establishes Substitute Farming Cooperative
　　Editor: In order to further improve the substitute farming work and improve the living standards of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, Ma Sen Village, Qin Yuan County, Shanxi Province, has been experimenting with the "mutual aid collective contract farming" method since March last year; now it has developed into a "substitute farming cooperative."
　　The substitute farming cooperative is composed of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and substitute farmers on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers invest with land, and the substitute farmers invest with labor and land. According to the quality of the invested land, the yield is assessed, with each shi (a unit of dry measure for grain, equal to one hectoliter) of coarse grain as one share. Unified management is implemented. After the autumn harvest, grain and dividends are distributed according to shares. In addition to the assessed yield, 60 percent of the increased production is given to the members, 20 percent is used as a public accumulation fund, and 20 percent is used as a bonus for the substitute farmers. All substitute farmed land in the village should be borne equally by the labor force of the whole village; those who are unwilling to substitute farm can provide substitute farming rice to the substitute farming cooperative. Some families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are unwilling to join the substitute farming cooperative, and their land that should be substitute farmed is still the responsibility of the village preferential treatment committee. There are a total of 14 households in Ma Sen Village who should enjoy substitute farming preferential treatment. Initially, 9 households joined the cooperative, and later another 4 households joined. After one year of trial operation, the unit area yield of the substitute farming cooperative has exceeded that of previous years and exceeded the land yield of the masses in the village. Now, the cooperative has accumulated 4 shi and 3 dou (a unit of dry measure for grain, equal to one-tenth of a hectoliter) of millet in the public accumulation fund and purchased a new-style walking plow.
　　We believe that the substitute farming cooperative can be promoted and is provided for reference to the preferential treatment committees in various localities.
　　Guo Jingyuan, Head of the Substitute Farming Cooperative of Ma Sen Village, Qin Yuan County, Shanxi Province
　　Wang Sihu, Deputy Head
　　Wang Renxu, Representative of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers
　　Editor's note: The practice of the substitute farming cooperative in Ma Sen Village, Qin Yuan County, Shanxi Province can be used for reference in various localities. However, it must be implemented according to local conditions and with the consent of the local people, and should never be carried out by order.
　　Suggestions for Summer Preferential Treatment Work
　　Editor: The spring plowing and sowing work has ended, and the work of summer harvest, summer planting, and summer weeding is about to begin or has already begun. This is an important juncture that determines the success of the autumn harvest. In order to timely solve the problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in production and life, I put forward the following opinions on the summer preferential treatment work: 1. The substitute farmers must timely do a good job of harvesting wheat for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and do a good job of wheat seed selection to create conditions for the wheat harvest of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers next year. 2. Before summer planting, all localities should help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers prepare bean seeds. For the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who have difficulties, the people's governments in various localities should solve them through the issuance of "subsidies for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers," government loans, or encouragement of free lending, so as to sow in a timely manner. 3. Summer is a favorable season for accumulating fertilizer. All localities should seize the opportunity to organize the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to accumulate fertilizer. For the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who are unable to accumulate fertilizer, the method of accumulating fertilizer in exchange for work can be promoted to solve the problem. 4. If the houses of poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in various localities are damaged and need to be repaired, they should be helped to repair them before the rainy season arrives. 5. Special attention should be paid to the protection of martyrs' tombs or other related memorial buildings during the rainy season to avoid damage. 6. Various localities should hold representative meetings of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and models of preferential treatment work at the township or district level to study the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer weeding work of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The civil affairs commissioners of the district and township governments should promptly organize inspections to discover and solve problems.

　　Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers Determined to Do a Good Job in Production
　　Editor: We are the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in Chaoyang Guanxiang Street, 10th District, Beijing. We are well taken care of by the local people's government and farmers, and we are writing this letter with gratitude and joy.
　　During the Spring Festival this year, the people's government prepared a large amount of flour, meat, and many festival goods and delivered them to our homes. Some comrades helped us carry water and clean the courtyard. Women comrades washed and made clothes for the elderly and orphaned families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The district chief, section chief, and street chief visited the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers respectively. What a great comfort this is to us! During the Dragon Boat Festival, the comrades sent us zongzi (rice dumplings). Representatives from eighteen kilns in the eastern suburbs of Beijing also sent us holiday gifts. The care of the people's government and people from all walks of life makes us feel extremely happy and glorious. We know that this joy is brought by Chairman Mao, and all the glory should be attributed to Chairman Mao.
　　In order to thank Chairman Mao, we are determined to overcome the current difficulties, do a good job in production, and be determined to help each other and cooperate to solve problems in life, and strive to reduce government spending and people's burden, so as to save materials to support the front. We will also write letters to encourage our husbands and children on the front lines in Korea to work hard to kill the enemy in order to defend peaceful and happy days.

　　Opinions on Improving the Work of Political Power at the County Level and Below
　　Editor: After reading the article "I Encountered Many Obstacles When I Reported Counter-Revolutionary Elements" written by Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver, published in the People's Daily on May 30, I am reminded that bureaucratism is not only quite serious in some agencies in the city, but also seriously exists in the government departments at the county level and below. I was born in a rural area near Tianjin, and based on some of the situations I have learned, I would like to put forward a few opinions on improving the work of government agencies at the county level and below for reference. 1. Properly handle past incidents of government staff and district and village cadres oppressing the masses, in order to eliminate the concerns of the masses and encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to care about government work. 2. The party organizations at the county level should lead the establishment of publicity networks in townships and towns, train and train propagandists in villages and towns, and mobilize them to go deep into the masses to publicize the party and government's policies and current affairs. Or, the county organizes propaganda teams to regularly tour the villages to explain policies and publicize current affairs. 3. Correct the tendency of district and village cadres not asking about politics and not knowing current affairs. Mobilize farmers in each village to organize reading groups, guide the masses to study politics, and care about current affairs. 4. The supervisory agencies should hire outstanding party members, league members, and activists in rural villages as people's supervisors and mobilize them to boldly report all illegal and disciplined behaviors of staff. The government should promptly deal with all large and small events reported by them. 5. The provincial people's government, special commissioner's office, or county people's government should select a group of outstanding cadres to serve as "visitors" or "discipline inspectors" and regularly go to villages and towns to conduct surveys and visits, so that "lower-level conditions can be reported to higher levels." 6. Use the method of training or rotation training to give district and village cadres regular opportunities to receive education, in order to improve their working ability.

　　Tibetan People in Daofu County Value Hygiene
　　Editor: In April, the Central National Health Work Team arrived in Daofu County, Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xikang Province, and was warmly welcomed by the Daofu people. Representatives from all walks of life in Daofu County and the Central National Health Work Team held a health symposium and established the Daofu County Health Work Committee. With the assistance of the county health committee, the Central National Health Work Team carried out publicity on health work through exhibitions, symposiums, individual visits, and the screening of slideshows. As a result, the attitude of ethnic minorities who were unwilling to treat diseases and doubted medicine, which was caused by the past reactionary rulers, has been greatly changed. At the exhibition, Tibetan women understood the benefits of the new delivery method and immediately asked to learn. The staff of the laboratory department of the exhibition explained the principles and severity of venereal diseases to the audience, and many Tibetans asked for blood tests, and some even asked their whole families to be checked. A new health clinic has been established here, and more than 70 Tibetans went to see a doctor on the first day, and the number increased day by day. Now more than 95% of the people in Daofu County have been vaccinated against smallpox. After the establishment of the health training class, the county women's federation immediately sent 20 women to learn the new delivery method, and others went to learn epidemic prevention knowledge. This is truly an unprecedented event.
　　Before liberation, the people of Daofu and other ethnic minority areas, like other people, were struggling without medicine and without understanding health knowledge, and the mortality rate was very high. Today, the Daofu people have been freed from the pain they could not get rid of in the past. At gatherings of the Daofu people, we often hear Tibetan youths, women, lamas, and living Buddhas say: "The Central National Health Team has come, and adults and children are blessed." "Chairman Mao's benefits cannot be finished."

    山西平顺西沟村群众重视代耕工作
    编辑同志：山西省平顺县西沟村的代耕工作做得很好。去年每亩代耕土地的平均产量是三百七十五斤，已经超过战前水平百分之一百零六。今年全村农民在“保证烈属军属增产”的口号下，开展了爱国代耕竞赛，要求每亩代耕地再增产四十斤（一般群众计划每亩地增产三十五斤），并订出了春耕播种的具体计划。到五月十五日止，该村代耕土地的春耕播种工作已胜利结束，并超额完成了计划。他们代耕的土地，耕、耢、耙都是三遍；每亩施肥一百一十担，超过计划五担（即超过一般群众五担）；此外，还替烈属军属垒塌岸六十五道，超过计划二十一道；原计划立夏节前完成播种，结果提前五天完成了。
    西沟村代耕工作之所以做得好，主要原因是村人民政府加强了对群众的政治教育，首先领导群众学习了“谁是最可爱的人”和关于反对美国细菌战的文件，群众认识到，做好代耕工作，就是支援“最可爱的人”。另外，该村加强了优抚委员会的领导，及时检查代耕工作，培养代耕模范和模范烈属军属，这些也是把代耕工作作好的原因。

    建议把代耕地包给互助组
    编辑同志：今年北京市第十区西店村开始把军属代耕地包给互助组，效果很好。该村有军属三十七户，需要代耕土地的有六户，共计五十亩。这些地都由互助组包耕。全年每亩地按五个工包耕，每工十二斤半玉米，互助组保证地里不长草，产量超过互助组的土地。军属计禄有的六亩地，包给韩昌华互助组代耕。该组在爱国增产计划内订了一条：“地里有活先给军属干，保证产量超过各组员的。”军属计老大爷说：“互助组干的活好，把地弄得又禁旱又禁涝；我们还省心，不用送茶送饭；产量有保证，比找人种好的多。”高碑店军属需要代耕的地有六十亩，也正计划包给互助组。我认为，把无劳动力的烈属军属的地包给互助组是个好方法。我建议各地考虑采用这个办法。

    沁源马森村成立代耕合作社
    编辑同志：山西省沁源县马森村为了进一步搞好代耕工作，提高烈属军属的生活水平，从去年三月起试行“互助集体包耕”办法；现在已经发展成为“代耕合作社”。
    代耕合作社是在自愿两利的基础上，由烈属军属和代耕人组成的。烈属军属以土地入股，代耕人以劳力和土地入股。按照入股土地的好坏，评定产量，以每一石粗粮为一股。并实行统一经营。秋收后，按股分粮分红。各社员除分得评定的产量之外，增产部分的百分之六十分给各社员，百分之二十为公积金，百分之二十作为给代耕人的奖励金。全村代耕土地，应由全村劳力平均负担；不愿代耕的，可出代耕米给代耕合作社。有的烈属军属不愿加入代耕合作社，他们的应该代耕的土地，仍由村优抚委员会负责代耕。马森村应该享受代耕优待的共十四户，起初有九户入了社，后来又有四户入了社。经过一年来试办的结果，代耕合作社的单位面积产量，都超过了往年，并超过了村中群众的土地产量。现在，社中已经积了四石三斗小米的公积金，购买了新式步犁一张。
    我们认为代耕合作社可以推广，特提供各地优抚委员会参考。
    山西省沁源县马森村代耕合作社社  长  郭景源
    副社长  王四虎
    烈属军属代表  王仁旭
    编者按：山西省沁源县马森村代耕合作社的做法可供各地参考。但必须根据当地情况，并征得当地人民群众同意，才能实行，绝不应以命令行事。
    对夏季优抚工作的建议
    编辑同志：春耕播种工作已经结束了，夏收、夏种、夏锄等工作即将开始或已经开始。这是决定秋收好坏的重要关头。为及时解决烈属军属在生产、生活方面的问题，我对夏季的优抚工作提出下列意见：一、代耕人必须适时地为烈属军属做好收割小麦的工作，并做好小麦选种工作，给明年烈属军属的小麦丰产创造条件。二、在夏种前，各地应帮助烈属军属准备好豆种。对有困难的烈属军属，各地人民政府应通过发放“烈属军属补助粮”、政府贷款方法或鼓励自由借贷予以解决，以便适时播种。三、夏季是积肥的有利季节。各地应抓紧时机，组织烈属军属积肥。对无力积肥的烈属军属，可以提倡群众以积肥顶工的办法加以解决。四、各地贫苦烈属军属的房屋有破漏而需要修理的，在伏雨到来以前，应设法帮助修好。五、对烈士墓或其他有关纪念建筑物，在雨季应特别注意保护，以免损坏。六、各地以乡或区为单位，召开烈属军属和优抚工作模范的代表会议，研究烈属军属的夏收、夏种、夏锄等工作。区、乡政府的民政委员应该及时组织检查，以发现问题，解决问题。    林明

    烈属军属决心搞好生产
    编辑同志：我们是北京市第十区朝阳关厢街的烈属军属。我们受着当地人民政府和农民很好的照顾，我们以感激和愉快的心情来写这封信。
    今年春节时，人民政府准备了大批的面粉、肉和许多节货，挨门挨户地送给我们。有的同志帮助我们担水、打扫院子。妇女同志们给孤老的烈属军属洗衣服、做衣服。区长、科长、街长分别到各烈属军属户访问。这对我们是多大的安慰呀！端午节时，同志们又给我们送来了粽子。北京市东郊十八个窑场的代表也给我们送了节礼。人民政府和各界群众对我们的关心，使我们感到无比的愉快和光荣。我们知道，这种愉快是毛主席给带来的，一切光荣应该归于毛主席。
    为了感谢毛主席，我们决心克服目前的困难，把生产搞好，决心互助合作，解决生活中的问题，努力减少政府的开支和人民的负担，以节省下来的物资支援前线。我们并且要写信鼓励我们在朝鲜前线的丈夫、子女努力杀敌，以保卫和平幸福的日子。

    对健全县级以下政权工作的意见
    编辑同志：读了五月三十日人民日报刊载的赶车工人张顺有写的“我检举反革命分子时遭遇了重重阻难”一文后，我联想到官僚主义作风不但在城市的某些机关相当严重，在县级以下政权部门也是严重存在的。我出身在天津市附近的农村中，根据我所了解的一些情况，愿提出健全县级以下政权机关工作的几点意见，以供参考。一、适当地处理以往政府工作人员和区村干部欺压群众的事件，以消除群众的顾虑，鼓舞群众关心政府工作的积极性。二、各县级党组织应领导乡镇普遍建立宣传网，培养和训练村镇中的宣传员，发动他们深入群众，宣传党和政府的政策和时事。或由县组织宣传队经常巡回到乡村讲解政策和宣传时事。三、纠正区村干部不问政治、不知时事的倾向。动员各村农民组织读报组，引导群众学习政治，关心时事。四、监察机构应该聘请乡村中优秀的党团员和积极分子担任人民监察员，发动他们大胆检举一切工作人员的违法乱纪行为。政府对他们所检举的大小事件，都应该及时处理。五、省人民政府、专署或县人民政府应该选择一批优秀干部担任“访问员”或“纪律检查员”，经常到村镇中去调查访问，以使“下情可以上达”。六、用调训或轮训的方式，让区村干部经常有机会受到教育，以提高他们的工作能力。

    道孚县藏族人民重视卫生
    编辑同志：四月里，中央民族卫生工作队到了西康省藏族自治区道孚县，受到道孚人民的热烈欢迎。道孚县各界人民代表和中央民族卫生工作队举行了卫生座谈会，并成立了道孚县卫生工作委员会。中央民族卫生工作队在县卫生委员会的协助下，通过展览会、座谈会、个别访问、放映幻灯等形式，进行了卫生工作的宣传。结果，大大地改变了过去反动统治者所造成的少数民族人民不愿诊治疾病和对医药的怀疑态度。在展览会上，藏族妇女懂得了新接生法的好处，当场就要求学习。展览会化验部工作人员向观众讲解了性病的原理和严重性，很多藏胞便要求验血，有的甚至全家要求检查。这里新成立了卫生门诊所，第一天就有藏民七十多人前往就诊，以后逐日增加。现在道孚县百分之九十五以上的人都种了牛痘。卫生训练班成立以后，县妇女联合会立即保送了二十个妇女去学习新接生法，还有去学防疫知识的。这真是空前盛事。
    解放以前，道孚人民和其他少数民族地区人民一样，总是在没有医药、不懂得卫生常识的情况下挣扎着，死亡率很大。今天，道孚人民已经解除了过去无法摆脱的痛苦。在道孚人民聚会时，常常听到藏族青年、妇女、喇嘛、活佛们说：“中央民族卫生队来了，大人、娃儿都有了福。”“毛主席的好处说不完。”         刘光
