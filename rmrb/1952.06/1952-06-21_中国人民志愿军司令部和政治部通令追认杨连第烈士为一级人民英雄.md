Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th: The Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently issued a general order to the entire army, posthumously recognizing Yang Liandi, Deputy Company Commander of the First Company of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps, as a First-Class People's Hero, and naming the company where Yang Liandi served during his lifetime as the "Yang Liandi Company."

Yang Liandi was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China and a distinguished hero of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps. In 1950, he attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers. In 1951, he attended the National Congress of Railway Model Workers. In the same year, he was elected as a representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Combat Heroes' National Day Delegation to return home for observation and was invited to attend the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

During the great War of Liberation and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Yang Liandi made numerous contributions to the Chinese and Korean people. In the task of repairing a bridge in the motherland, he created a single-sided scaffold and risked climbing a 45-meter-high pier to level the pier surface. He single-handedly carried out more than 100 blasting operations, creating a miracle of climbing high to repair bridges, and was awarded the glorious title of "Climbing Hero." After volunteering to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, he climbed bridge piers along a single rail when repairing a bridge in a certain area, and fought bravely against floods, continuously erecting floating bridges three times, and finally successfully completed the repair task. On May 15th, Yang Liandi gloriously sacrificed his life while repairing a bridge in a certain area.

The Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a circular praising the heroic deeds of Martyr Yang Liandi, and called on all commanders and combatants of the army to learn from the great patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism of Martyr Yang Liandi.

    通令追认杨连第烈士为一级人民英雄
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部最近向全军发布通令，追认志愿军铁道部队某部第一连杨连第副连长为一级人民英雄，并命名杨连第生前所在的连队为“杨连第连”。
    杨连第是中国共产党的优秀党员、志愿军铁道部队杰出的英雄人物，曾在一九五零年出席全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议，一九五一年出席全国铁路劳动模范代表会议，同年当选为中国人民志愿军战斗英雄国庆节归国观礼代表团代表，并应邀列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议。
    在伟大的祖国解放战争与抗美援朝战争中，杨连第为中朝人民屡建功勋。他在祖国抢修某座桥梁的任务中，曾创造单面脚手架，冒险登上四十五公尺高的桥墩，整平桥墩面，只身连续爆破一百多次，创造抢修桥梁的登高奇迹，因而荣获“登高英雄”的光荣称号。他志愿参加抗美援朝战争后，在抢修某地桥梁时，曾奋不顾身地顺单轨爬登桥墩，并不顾艰险地与洪水搏斗，连续三次搭架浮桥，最后终于胜利地完成抢修任务。五月十五日，杨连第在抢修某地桥梁时光荣牺牲。
    中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部通报褒扬杨连第烈士的英雄史迹，并号召全军指挥员、战斗员学习杨连第烈士伟大的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义精神。
