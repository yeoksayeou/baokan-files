    This year's International Children's Day should be a day for a grand review of the powerful forces of people all over the world defending peace and defending children.
    The International Conference for the Defence of Children, held in Vienna not long ago, was attended by representatives from 61 countries, reflecting the common aspirations and determination of hundreds of millions of people of different languages, nationalities, and political and religious beliefs around the world to defend peace and defend children, and embodying this aspiration and determination in the "Resolution on Children's Health," the "Resolution on Children's Education," and the "Resolution on the Impact of Literature, Newspapers, Radio, Film and Art on the Spiritual and Cultural Development of Children." The conference also called for powerful demonstrations to be held universally on this year's "June 1st" Children's Day. Our country and the people of the world warmly support the resolutions of this conference and respond to its call to fight for the thorough implementation of these resolutions and call.
    The improvement of children's welfare is inseparable from the development of peaceful and democratic forces, the development of peaceful construction, and the improvement of the living standards of the masses. In the Soviet Union, China, and the various people's democratic countries, children have truly become "flowers of humanity." However, in capitalist countries, especially in imperialist countries and their dependencies and colonies, as a result of the expansion of armaments, the living standards of the people are declining day by day, and the material and spiritual lives of children are also deteriorating, and their physical and mental health is severely damaged. The cruel phenomenon of exploiting child labor is prevalent in many countries. Children in the United States, Britain, France, and Italy, in addition to the deteriorating material life, are also suffering from the poison of war propaganda, and some have become neurasthenic patients. While thousands of innocent children are crying in the prisons and concentration camps of Greece and Spain, the imperialist wars of aggression are massacring large numbers of children in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. In such circumstances, the holding of the Vienna International Conference for the Defence of Children and the publication of its three resolutions are of great significance. These resolutions are the battle program for the people of the world to defend peace and defend children.
    For more than two years, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have made great efforts and achieved remarkable results in the lofty cause of defending peace and defending children. Our movement to resist America and aid Korea has achieved great victories, severely cracking down on the US imperialist conspiracy to expand its war of aggression and ensuring the safety of our children. We have eliminated all factors at home that endanger peaceful and democratic life, restored and developed construction in all fields, and improved the living standards of the masses, providing basic conditions for the improvement of children's welfare. Our People's Government has, through laws and practical measures, safeguarded the rights of mothers and children, and established and developed various organizations for children's care and education. The number of nurseries in factories and government offices has increased twelve and a half times compared with the old China. Various childcare organizations have also begun to be established in rural areas, especially seasonal nurseries, which increased by more than one hundred and six times last year compared with the previous year. We have implemented new educational policies, carried out reforms in the primary school system, improved teaching content and teaching methods, and greatly increased the number of primary schools. Through newspapers, magazines, children's books, movies, radio broadcasts, etc., we have carried out patriotic and internationalist education for the vast number of children, cultivated their "five loves" public morality, and safeguarded their mental health. We have also done a lot of work in maternal and child health and child care, such as vaccinating 1.16 million children across the country against tuberculosis with BCG from 1950 to 1951. Our Party, government, and people are cultivating the new generation in all aspects.
    In order to consolidate, improve, and develop the existing children's protection and education cause, we should examine our children's protection and education ideology and work based on the new democratic educational policy, the characteristics of children's education, and the basic spirit of the three major resolutions of the International Conference for the Defence of Children. Children's protection and education work is a very important work and also a very hard work, and it should be given due importance and respect. Our country already has a large number of excellent cadres in this area, all of whom have a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for caring for children. However, some childcare workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of their work and think that it is "hard work with little reward," and therefore do not feel at ease in their work. Some primary school teachers also lack the spirit of wholeheartedly educating students. Children's protection and education workers in New China must fully recognize the importance of their responsibilities and should earn the respect of society with practical achievements in protection and education.
    Local experience proves that in order to widely develop children's protection and education organizations under the current conditions to gradually meet the needs of children across the country, revolutionary methods must be adopted. It is wrong to have too high demands on protection and education organizations, to emphasize standardization, or to rely on the idea of dependency. Under the assistance of relevant government departments and relevant organizations, the masses should be mobilized to solve the difficulties of mothers who cannot participate in work or cannot work with peace of mind because they are burdened with children, based on actual conditions and the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and using various methods. Some factories, schools, and streets are, with the help of relevant parties, using their own strength to set up nurseries and childcare stations simply and economically, and many rural areas have set up seasonal nurseries, baby-holding groups, etc. These experiences should be quickly promoted in order to liberate more female labor.
    The future of New China is unlimited, and the future of the children of New China is also unlimited. Let us accept the resolutions of the International Conference for the Defence of Children with full confidence and fight more bravely for defending peace and defending children!

### 保卫儿童，发展儿童保教事业

    保卫儿童，发展儿童保教事业
    今年的国际儿童节，应该是全世界人民保卫和平、保卫儿童的强大力量总检阅的日子。
    不久以前在维也纳召开的国际保卫儿童会议有六十一国代表参加，反映了全世界不同语言、不同民族、不同政治和宗教信仰的亿万人民保卫和平、保卫儿童的共同愿望和决心，而且把这种愿望和决心体现在
    “关于儿童健康的决议”、“关于儿童教育的决议”、
    “关于文学、报纸、无线电、电影和艺术对于儿童的精神和文化发展的影响的决议”中。会议并号召在今年“六一”儿童节普遍举行强大的示威。我国和全世界人民都热烈拥护这个会议的决议，响应它的号召，要为彻底实现这些决议和号召而斗争。
    儿童福利的增进，是跟和平民主力量的发展、和平建设事业的发展及人民大众生活水平的提高分不开的。在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家，儿童已经真正成为“人类的花朵”。但在各资本主义国家，尤其是在帝国主义国家及其附庸国和殖民地，由于扩张军备的结果，使人民生活水平日益下降，儿童的物质生活和精神生活也日益恶化了，他们的身心健康备受摧残。压榨童工血汗的惨酷现象，在许多国家里普遍存在着。美国、英国、法国和意大利的儿童们，除了物质生活日益恶化以外，还受尽了战争宣传的毒害，有的已经变成神经衰弱的病人了。当希腊和西班牙的监狱和集中营里成千无罪的儿童正在哭泣的时候，帝国主义的侵略战争，又大量屠杀着朝鲜、越南和马来亚的儿童。在这样的情况下，维也纳国际保卫儿童会议的举行和它的三项决议的公布，就有非常重大的意义。这些决议就是全世界人民保卫和平、保卫儿童的战斗纲领。
    两年多以来，在毛泽东同志和中国共产党领导下的中国人民，在保卫和平、保卫儿童的崇高事业上，作了巨大的努力，获得了显著的成绩。我们的抗美援朝运动已经取得了伟大的胜利，沉重地打击了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，保障了我国儿童的安全。我们消灭了国内一切危害和平民主生活的因素，恢复和发展了各方面的建设，提高了人民大众的生活水平，为儿童福利的增进提供了基本的条件。我们人民政府通过法令和实际措施，保障了母亲和儿童们的权利，建立和发展了儿童保育、教育的各种组织。工厂、机关的托儿所，比旧中国增加了十二倍半。农村也开始建立了各种托儿组织，尤其是农忙托儿所，去年就比前年增加一百零六倍强。我们执行了新的教育方针，进行了小学的学制改革，改进了教学内容和教学方法，小学数目大量增加。我们通过报纸、杂志、儿童读物、电影、无线电广播等，向广大儿童进行了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，培养他们的“五爱”公德，维护他们的精神健康。我们在妇幼卫生和儿童的保健方面，也作了很多工作，如一九五○年至一九五一年，为预防结核病，在全国儿童中接种了卡介苗达一百一十六万人。我们的党、政府和人民，从各方面培养着新的一代。
    为了巩固、提高和发展现有的儿童保教事业，我们应该根据新民主主义的教育方针、儿童教育的特点和国际保卫儿童会议三大决议的基本精神，来检查我们的儿童保教思想和保教工作。儿童保教工作是非常重要的工作，也是非常辛苦的工作，应该受到应有的重视和尊敬。我国在这方面已经有了大批优秀干部，她们都有高度的责任感和爱护儿童的热情。可是也有部分保育工作者对自己工作的重要性认识不足，认为“吃力不讨好”，因而不安心工作。部分小学教师也缺乏全心全意教育学生的精神。新中国的儿童保教工作者必须充分认识自己职责的重大，应该用实际的保教成绩来取得社会的尊敬。
    各地经验证明：要在目前的条件下广泛发展儿童保教组织，以逐步满足全国儿童的需要，就必须采取革命的办法。对保教组织的要求不能太高，强调正规化或依赖的思想，都是不对的。应该在政府有关部门和有关团体的帮助下，发动群众，根据实际情况和互助两利原则，运用各种各样的方法，来解决母亲们因有孩子牵累而不能参加工作或不能安心工作的困难。有些工厂、学校和街道，都正在有关方面的帮助下，用自己的力量，因陋就简地办起了托儿间和托儿站，许多农村里都设立了农忙托儿所、抱娃娃组等，这些经验应该迅速推广起来，以便解放更多的妇女劳动力。
    新中国的前途是无限量的，新中国儿童的前途也是无限量的。让我们满怀信心地接受国际保卫儿童会议的决议，为保卫和平、保卫儿童而更英勇地奋斗吧！
