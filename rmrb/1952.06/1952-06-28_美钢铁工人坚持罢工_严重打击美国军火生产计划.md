Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 24th: The nationwide strike of 650,000 steelworkers in the United States, which began on June 2nd, has now entered its fourth week. The strike has severely hit the US arms production plans and is causing more and more industrial sectors to grind to a halt due to the shortage of steel. Despite the US authorities' attempts to suppress the strike by invoking reactionary legislation, the strong determination of the striking workers has frustrated these shameful plots.

According to a United Press report on the 18th, many factories have had to stop the production of certain military supplies due to the depletion of steel reserves. For example, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Company will stop producing 3.5-inch rocket shells this week due to a lack of seamless steel pipes. The Ran Corp Manufacturing Company in Cleveland has had to stop producing 60mm and 80mm mortar shells due to a lack of raw materials. The Cadillac Tank Plant, which manufactures the T41 Walker light tank, announced that it can only maintain production for another ten to fourteen days. Although the plant does not plan to close down, it is considering reducing weekly working hours. International Harvester plans to close three truck factories, including a factory in Wayne Fort, Indiana, that manufactures military trucks. Chrysler Corporation also announced that its Dodge factory will stop producing three-quarter-ton military trucks in a week. In addition, the Philadelphia Ordnance Factory announced on the 19th that it would reduce the production of T47 tanks by 30% due to a lack of tank turrets.

The serious situation caused by the steel strike has caused great headaches for US officials. Defense Production Administrator Fuller announced on the 20th that despite the efforts of the US government to find a solution, US military production is gradually approaching a standstill due to the steelworkers' strike. According to Agence France-Presse on the 20th, US Department of Defense officials admitted that if the strike continues, all military production, from jet engines to atomic bombs, will be halted in a few weeks due to a lack of special steel and ordinary steel. Generally speaking, the steel reserves available to major factories producing US military orders can only be maintained for four to six weeks at the current rate of production. US President Truman also admitted at a press conference on the 19th that "the situation has become very serious." Truman said:

"Since steel is one of the foundations of the American economy, a shortage of steel will soon affect all industries in the United States."

In order to prevent the standstill of US arms production, the Truman administration has not only taken emergency measures to limit the use of steel stockpiles to military production but has also recently ordered a ban on the export of all milled iron. However, even Defense Production Administrator Fuller admitted that these emergency measures cannot "greatly alleviate" the growing impact of the steel industry strike.

In this situation, the US ruling group is plotting to suppress the strike by violence. As early as the 13th, the US Senate passed a resolution requesting Truman to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, which stipulates that the government has the right to force an 80-day delay in strikes, to force workers to return to work. However, under the strong fighting power of the 650,000 steelworkers across the country, Truman himself did not dare to take coercive measures rashly. He had to admit at a press conference on the 19th: "Another eighty days will only prolong the pain."

Now, the fighting will of the steelworkers is getting stronger and stronger. This will has made Murray, the right-wing leader of the United Steelworkers of America, say on the 23rd that the striking steelworkers are determined to resist any action that may be taken against them. He also said that it is not the "Taft-Hartley Act" that can smelt steel, but the workers.

### 美钢铁工人坚持罢工  严重打击美国军火生产计划

    美钢铁工人坚持罢工
    严重打击美国军火生产计划
    【新华社二十四日讯】华盛顿消息：六月二日开始的美国全国六十五万钢铁工人大罢工现已进入第四周。罢工已严重地打击了美国的军火生产计划，并使愈来愈多的工业部门因钢铁缺乏而趋于停顿。尽管美国当局企图援用反动立法进行镇压，但是罢工工人们的坚强的斗争决心已使这些可耻阴谋归于破产。
    据合众社十八日消息透露，由于钢铁存底告罄，许多工厂已不得不停止某些军事物资的生产。例如福特汽车公司和通用汽车公司由于缺乏无缝铁管，本周起将停止生产三点五吋的火箭炮弹。克利夫兰的兰柯浦制造公司由于缺乏原料，不得不停止生产口径六十公厘和八十公厘的迫击炮弹。制造T41瓦克轻型坦克的卡迪拉克坦克工厂宣布，它只能再维持生产十天到十四天。该厂虽然还没有关门的打算，但是已在考虑减少每周工作时间。万国农具公司计划关闭三家卡车工厂，其中有设于印第安纳州威茵堡制造军用卡车的工厂在内。克莱斯勒汽车公司也宣布，它的道奇工厂一星期以后将停止生产四分之三吨的军用卡车。此外，费城兵工厂十九日也已宣布，由于缺乏坦克炮塔，该厂将减少T47型坦克产量百分之三十。
    钢铁罢工所造成的严重情况已使美国官方大为头痛。国防生产局局长富勒二十日宣布，尽管美国政府努力想办法，但是，由于钢铁工人罢工的缘故，美国军事生产已经逐渐接近停止。据法新社二十日透露，美国国防部人士承认，如果罢工继续下去，则由于缺乏特种钢和普通钢的缘故，不出几个星期从喷气引擎到原子弹的一切军事生产，都将停顿。一般讲来，生产美国军事订货的各主要工厂中所能得到的钢铁存量，如照目前生产速率进行，只能维持四星期到六星期。美国总统杜鲁门十九日在记者招待会上也承认，“局势已非常严重”。杜鲁门说：
    “由于钢铁是美国经济的基础之一，钢铁缺货不久就要影响到美国所有的工业。”
    为了不使美国军火生产停顿，杜鲁门政府除已采取紧急措施，限定将钢铁存货仅供军事生产之用以外，最近又下令禁止一切铣铁出口。但是，就连国防生产局局长富勒也承认，这些紧急措施并不能
    “大大减轻”钢铁工业罢工的日益扩大的影响。
    在这种情况下，美国统治集团又阴谋以暴力镇压罢工。美国参议院早在十三日就曾通过决议，要求杜鲁门援用规定政府有权强制罢工延迟八十天举行的塔夫脱—哈特莱法，来逼迫工人复工。但是，在全国六十五万钢铁工人的坚强斗争的威力下，杜鲁门本人也不敢贸然采取强制手段。他在十九日记者招待会上不得不承认：“再有八十天也只会徒然延长痛苦而已。”
    现在，钢铁工人的斗争意志正越来越坚强。这种意志使得美国钢铁工人工会的右翼头子莫莱二十三日也说：罢工中的钢铁工人决心反抗可能对他们采取的任何行动。他又说：能够炼出钢来的，不是“塔夫脱—哈特莱法”，而是工人。
