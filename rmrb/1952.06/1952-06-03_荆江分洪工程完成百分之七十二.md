    Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Completed Seventy-Two Percent
    [Special dispatch from our newspaper's Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project construction site, 1st] The 300,000 military personnel, civilian laborers, workers, technical personnel, and administrative staff participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call: "Strive for the victory of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project for the benefit of the broad masses of the people!" As of May 31st, they have worked hard to complete 72 percent of the entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project.
    Currently, the progress of the main parts of the flood diversion project is as follows: The entire North Gate project has been completed by 72.6 percent. Among them, the installation of gates has been completed for 20 openings, accounting for 37 percent of all 54 openings. The entire South Gate project has been completed by 57.3 percent. The entire South Embankment project has completed 80 percent of the total task. Among them, the Huduhu River West Embankment and the Zhonghe River closure have been fully completed, the Anxiang River North Embankment has completed 88.5 percent, and the Huangtianhu New Line has completed 67.8 percent. The reinforcement project of the Jingjiang Dam has been completed by 85.9 percent of the total task.
    On May 28th, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Frontline CCP Committee held an emergency meeting. The meeting issued a decision calling for all measures to be taken to complete the entire project by June 20th, and firmly demanding "Only allow doing it well, not allowing doing it poorly, only allow success, not allowing failure." Now all remaining tasks have been specifically assigned to each engineering unit, even down to the team and individual. The military personnel, civilian laborers, and other engineering personnel on each construction site are responding to this call with full confidence, beginning a labor emulation even more intense than the Red May, striving to complete all flood diversion projects as scheduled.
