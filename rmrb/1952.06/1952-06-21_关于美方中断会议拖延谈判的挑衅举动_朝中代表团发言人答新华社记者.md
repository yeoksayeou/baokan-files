(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 20th) On June 17th, the US side's representatives at the Korean armistice negotiations once again unilaterally announced a three-day recess at the plenary meeting of both delegations and left the venue midway. Regarding this matter, the reporter interviewed the spokesman of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army armistice negotiation delegation, who provided the following answers to the questions raised:

    Q: What are your thoughts on the US side's recent actions?

    A: The US side has not provided any reasonable explanation for its rude and provocative action of unilaterally announcing a three-day recess and leaving the venue midway on June 7th, and it has now repeated this behavior. Leaving the venue midway before the meeting concludes, this crude behavior is completely inconsistent with the spirit of consultation that should be present in armistice negotiations that are of concern to the whole world. The US side is well aware that the people of the world are eagerly hoping that an agreement can be reached in the negotiations as soon as possible, but they insist on breaking all the conventions of international conferences and repeatedly interrupting meetings unilaterally without consultation. By doing so, they are announcing to the world that they are deliberately sabotaging the negotiations and are unwilling to reach a Korean armistice agreement.

    Q: Why has the US side repeatedly taken such unilateral and rude provocative actions?

    A: This is because the US side can find no reason whatsoever to defend its plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war in face-to-face discussions and is afraid of holding meetings to reason things out.

    The US side's plan to detain prisoners of war is completely unfounded. They have violated all international laws and conventions and infringed upon the individual rights and interests of prisoners of war who want to return home and live a peaceful life. The US side wants to detain our captured personnel for the sake of preparing to expand its war of aggression, but they cannot bring themselves to say this reason. As for our plan, they know that it has irrefutable reasons and basis, so they dare not discuss it, and they only monotonously repeat their statement that their plan is "firm, final, and unchangeable," which is extremely arrogant. After our side has repeatedly and severely refuted their arrogant attitude and rogue actions, they not only dare not respond to our arguments, but also withhold our documents and official letters, and dare not publish them. Under these circumstances, they repeatedly unilaterally interrupt meetings, hoping to delay the negotiations in this way, and vainly attempt to impose their unreasonable plan on our side.

    Q: Do you think the US representatives' approach can achieve their desired goals?

    A: Absolutely not. The above-mentioned arrogant and rogue actions of the US side can only show the US side's fear of truth and facts, and will never have any effect on our side that the US side vainly hopes for, and of course, it cannot provide any help to the resolution of the problem. No matter how rogue the US side is in evading meetings, unless the US side publicly announces a break and assumes responsibility for sabotaging the negotiations, our side will still insist on holding meetings, insist on reasoning, and insist on both sides working hard to solve the problem, so as to determine that the US side's responsibility is inescapable.

    Q: The US side has proposed holding a so-called "re-screening" with neutral countries or neutral institutions presiding over it and representatives from both sides participating, and it is also heard that the US side has invited five neutral countries to visit the US side's POW camps on Geoje Island. What are your thoughts on this?

    A: So-called "screening" is a fundamental violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention and is therefore completely illegal. No form of so-called "re-screening" can make the same "screening" legal. Our side firmly opposes any "screening" or "re-screening." I do not believe that any truly neutral country or institution would agree to or participate in such illegal actions. The crimes committed by the US side in its POW camps are a universally recognized fact. I believe that no truly neutral country will go to the US side's POW camps to act as a tool for whitewashing the US side's crimes.

    Q: How do you think the issue of prisoner of war repatriation can be resolved?

    A: Currently, there is only one international convention in the world that resolves the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and that is the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. The US government and its allies have all signed that convention. Representatives of both sides have also established an agreement in the spirit of this convention to ensure that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War after repatriation, so that they can return home and live a peaceful life. Our side's May 2nd proposal and the same proposal mentioned in the June 9th letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Clark are fully in line with the principles of the Geneva Convention and in line with the guarantees required by the agreement. The issue of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice negotiations must be resolved on the basis of this universally recognized international convention. This is the firm and unwavering position of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    关于美方中断会议拖延谈判的挑衅举动
    朝中代表团发言人答新华社记者
    【新华社开城二十日电】六月十七日朝鲜停战谈判的美方代表又一次在双方代表团大会上片面宣布休会三天，中途离开会场。记者特就此事走访朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团发言人，提出下列问题，承其答复如下：
    问：你对于美方这次举动的感想如何？
    答：美方对六月七日片面宣布休会三天，并中途退出会场的无礼挑衅举动尚未作任何合理的交代，竟又再次重复这一行为，不等会议结束，便中途从会场逃走，这种粗野行为和举世关心的停战谈判所应有的协商精神是完全不相称的。美方明知世界人民都切盼谈判能够早日达成协议，而他们偏偏要打破一切国际会议的惯例，一次再次的不经协议，片面中断会议，他们这样做，就是向全世界宣布：他们蓄意破坏谈判，不愿达成朝鲜停战协议。
    问：为什么美方一次又一次地采取这种片面无礼的挑衅行动呢？
    答：这是因为美方完全找不出任何理由在双方面对面的讨论中为他们强迫扣留战俘的方案辩解而惧怕开会说理的缘故。
    美方的扣留战俘方案是完全没有任何根据的。他们既违反了一切国际法规与公约，又侵犯了战俘要求回家过和平生活的个人权利和利益。美方是为了准备扩大侵略战争的利益而要扣留我方被俘人员，但这个理由又是说不出口的。对我方的方案，他们因为知道那是有无可辩驳的理由和根据的，故不敢进行讨论，而只是单调地重复他们的方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”那种蛮横已极的声明。在我方对他们的蛮横态度和无赖行动多次痛加驳斥之后，他们不仅是不敢对我方论点提出答复，并且把我方的文件和公函也加以扣留，不敢予以发表。在这种情况之下，他们就一再片面中断会议，希图靠这个来拖延谈判，并妄想把他们的无理方案强加于我方。
    问：你以为美方代表这种做法能够达到他们所追求的目的吗？
    答：绝对不能够的。上述美方那些蛮横无赖的举动只能表现美方对于真理和事实的畏惧，而对于我方是绝不能发生任何美方所妄想的作用的，当然更不可能对于问题的解决提供任何帮助。不管美方如何无赖逃会，除非美方公开宣布破裂，承当破坏谈判的责任，否则，我方还是要坚持开会，坚持说理，坚持双方努力解决问题，以判明美方的责任是无可逃避的。
    问：美方提议举行一次有中立国家或中立机构主持并由双方代表参加的所谓“再甄别”，又据闻美方已经邀请五个中立国家到巨济岛去访问美方战俘营。对此，你的意见如何？
    答：所谓“甄别”根本违反了一九四九年日内瓦公约，因而是完全非法的。任何形式的所谓“再甄别”也不能把同样的“甄别”变成合法的。我方坚决反对任何“甄别”或“再甄别”。我不相信有任何真正的中立国家或机构会同意或参与这种非法行动。美方在其战俘营中所犯下的罪行已是举世公认的事实。我相信任何真正的中立国家决不会到美方战俘营去充当洗刷美方罪行的工具。
    问：你以为怎样才能解决战俘遣返问题呢？
    答：目前世界上只有一个解决战俘遣返问题的国际公约，那就是日内瓦战俘公约。美国政府及其盟邦都在那个公约上签了字。双方代表并已根据这个公约的精神成立了一项保证战俘遣返后不再参加朝鲜战争的协议，使他们得以回家过和平生活。我方五月二日方案及金日成、彭德怀两将军六月九日致克拉克将军信中所提到的同一方案，完全符合于日内瓦公约原则，符合于协议所要的保证。朝鲜停战谈判中的战俘问题，必须在这个举世公认的国际公约的基础上，来求得解决。这是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚定不移的立场。
