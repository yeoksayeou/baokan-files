    East China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference's Transaction Volume Exceeds One Trillion Yuan

    [Dispatch from this Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Jiefang Daily, the transaction volume of the East China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference had reached 1,222 billion yuan by June 6th. Both agricultural products and industrial goods were traded vigorously. This not only solved the difficulty of sluggish sales of agricultural products but also played a significant role in supporting the production of small and medium-sized factories in cities, especially in Shanghai.

    In order to solve the problem of sluggish sales of agricultural products, the East China Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference successively convened specialized meetings on medicinal materials, oils and fats, timber, and bamboo pulp to resolve the difficulties of sluggish sales of large quantities of agricultural products through consultation. At the same time, the conference also held symposiums centered on delegations from Central and Southern China, North China, and Northeast China to organize comprehensive long-distance exchanges. As a result, the sluggish sales of general agricultural products gradually changed, and transactions became more prosperous.

    As the sales channels for agricultural products opened up, the market for industrial goods became more active. The proportion of industrial goods in the conference's transaction volume increased rapidly from 1.72 percent on the first day to more than 40 percent in the past two days. At the same time, the conference promptly mobilized representatives from various regions to purchase industrial goods for rural areas. Since the 6th, the Shanghai delegation has held continuous symposiums with delegations from various parts of East China and major administrative regions, requesting large-volume transactions. The Zhejiang delegation has proposed a purchase plan for 30 billion to 40 billion yuan of industrial goods. In the past two days, the more than 30 trading venues in the industrial goods department have been very active. Originally slow-selling stationery, soap, toothpaste, towels, and plastics have begun to sell, and woolen fabrics and matches have also shown signs of improvement. Underwear, socks, scissors, toothbrushes, and small hardware have begun to sign futures contracts for July, August, and even November and December. As the sales of industrial goods have become more active, the trading of industrial raw materials has also become prosperous. On the 5th alone, the chemical industry group completed transactions worth nearly 11.3 billion yuan.

    The material exchange conference has vigorously organized the work of sending industrial goods to the countryside and exchanging them with various regions, which has basically solved the problem of industrial production during the off-season. It has played a powerful role in supporting the production of small and medium-sized factories in various cities, especially in Shanghai. As of the 6th, the total transaction volume of industrial goods was more than 400 billion yuan, of which the portion sold by the Shanghai delegation accounted for about 90 percent of the total. Through exchange activities, the small and medium-sized factories that had stopped production were first able to resume production. For example, there were more than 160 handicraft scissors factories in Shanghai, almost all of which had stopped production in the past five months. Through this conference, they sold more than 40,000 pairs of scissors and received more than 100 million yuan in cash. Because they borrowed 30 million yuan in production loans from the People's Bank of China, they have all resumed production. Xinhua Factory, which is engaged in the handkerchief industry, did not start work this year due to financial difficulties, and its brother factory partially stopped work for two months. Yiming Factory stopped work for nearly three months, but at this exchange conference, the handkerchief industry successively sold nearly 40,000 dozen of inventory. With this assistance, these factories have recently resumed production one after another. Many small and medium-sized manufacturers have been able to survive the off-season as a result. For example, the Shanghai Shoe Industry Association has eight joint ventures with more than 300 factories and more than 1,000 workers. Business has been very slow this year, and production has been in a state of semi-shutdown. This time, they received an order from the Northeast Trade Department for 73,000 pairs of leather shoes, which can keep production going until the end of August. The thermos bottle industry is currently in a slow season for production and sales, and there is a large inventory of inner containers, making it difficult to turn over funds. After a large purchase by the East China Cooperative General Society, they received a short-term order for 28,000 dozen, and the entire industry's off-season production problem has been completely solved.

    华东城乡物资交流大会交易总额逾万亿元
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：华东区城乡物资交流大会交易总额，到六月六日止，已达一万二千二百二十亿元。土产和工业品的交易都很旺盛。这不仅解决了土产滞销的困难，还对支持城市特别是上海的中小工厂的生产起了重大的作用。
    为了解决土产滞销问题，华东区城乡物资交流大会曾连续召开了药材、油脂、木材及竹浆等专业会议，以协商方式解决了大宗土产的滞销困难。同时，大会又分别举行了以中南、华北、东北等代表团为中心的座谈会，组织全面性的远程交流。因而，一般土产都先后改变滞销现象，交易趋于畅旺。
    由于土产销路的打开，工业品市场交易转旺。工业品近两日来在大会交易额中的比重，由第一日的百分之一一点七二，迅速上升到百分之四十以上。同时，大会又及时动员各地代表购买工业品下乡。自六日起，上海代表团连续与华东各地及各大行政区的代表团开座谈会，要求大宗交易。浙江代表团已提出三百至四百亿的工业品购入计划。近两日来，工业品部的三十多个交易场所甚为活跃，原来呆销的文具、肥皂、牙膏、毛巾、塑胶等都开始行销，呢绒、火柴等也有起色，内衣、袜子、剪刀、牙刷、小五金等已开始签订七、八月以至十一、二月份的期货。因工业品销路转活，工业原料的交易也跟着畅旺，仅五日一天，化工组就成交近一百一十三亿元。
    物资交流大会大力组织工业品下乡和与各地交流的工作，已基本上解决了淡季中的工业生产问题。对支持各城市特别是上海市的中小工厂生产，起了有力作用。到六日止，工业品的成交总额共四千多亿元，其中上海代表团售出部分占总数百分之九十左右。通过交流业务，首先使停工的中、小厂家恢复了生产。例如上海的手工剪刀业共有一百六十多家，过去五个月来几乎全部停工。通过这次大会，他们销出了四万多把剪刀，收进现金一亿多元，又因为向人民银行借得生产贷款三千万元，已全部恢复生产。从事手帕业的新华厂因为资金困难，今年未开工，兄弟厂局部停工达两月之久，一鸣厂停工近三个月，但在这次交流大会上，手帕业先后售出存货近四万打。有了这些帮助，这几个厂才在最近先后恢复生产。许多中、小厂商并因此能度过淡季。例如上海制鞋公会八个联营共有三百多个厂，一千多工人，今年的生意很少，生产陷于半停顿状态，这次接到东北贸易部七万三千双皮鞋的订货，可使生产维持到八月底。热水瓶业目前正处产销淡季，瓶胆存量很多，资金周转困难，经过华东合作总社大量收购后，又接到了二万八千打的短期订货，全业的淡季生产问题已完全解决。
