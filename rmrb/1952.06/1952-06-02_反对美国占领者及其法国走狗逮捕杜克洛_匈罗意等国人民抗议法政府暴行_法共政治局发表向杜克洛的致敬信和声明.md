(Xinhua News Agency, May 31st) The French government's brutal act of illegally arresting French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos at the instigation of its American masters has aroused angry protests from people around the world. Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, and Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, have all sent telegrams to the French Communist Party, protesting the arrest of Duclos and expressing solidarity with the French people's struggle for peace and national independence.

The telegram from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, signed by General Secretary Rákosi, sent to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, stated: "The American imperialist occupiers and their French lackeys are using this despicable act of murder to oppose the French working class, oppose the independence of France, and oppose the cause of peace. The Hungarian people are united in protesting the arrest of this great son and freedom fighter of the French people. The Hungarian Working People's Party expresses its solidarity with the fraternal French Communist Party and wishes it victory in its struggle for French independence, democratic freedom, and peace." The Hungarian National Peace Council, the Hungarian Lawyers Association, the Hungarian Trade Union, the Central Committee of the League of Working Youth, and other mass organizations have all sent telegrams to the French government expressing their protests. In recent days, mass rallies have been continuously held in enterprises and government departments throughout Hungary to protest Duclos's arrest.

In Romania, after the news of Duclos's arrest was released, a wave of angry protests immediately swept the country. On the 29th, workers at the "Republic" factory in Bucharest held a mass meeting and passed a protest telegram to the French government of René Mayer, denouncing this fascist atrocity and demanding the immediate release of Duclos. On the 30th, tens of thousands of workers, students, women, and youth in Bucharest held a grand rally to protest the arrest of Duclos. The masses participating in the rally shouted slogans, expressing their firm support for the French people's struggle for peace and independence and against the American war plans. Constantin Ion Parhon, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic and Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Romanian Committee for the Defense of Peace, spoke at the rally, saying: "The French people trust the French Communist Party, and the French people will never allow France to be turned into a colony of the United States, nor will they allow French youth to be turned into cannon fodder in the aggressive war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries prepared by American imperialism." The conference unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the French Communist Party, expressing solidarity.

In Belgium, all democratic organizations unanimously protested the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos, Stey, and patriots who participated in the demonstrations against Ridgway's arrival in France. Workers at the "Aceces" factory in Charleroi sent a telegram to the French President, expressing solidarity with Duclos and demanding his immediate release. According to the "Red Flag" newspaper, the French Embassy in Brussels received many letters protesting the French government's persecution of Duclos.

The American Communist Party's newspaper, the New York "Daily Worker," pointed out: "The French government, which only listens to the United States, has launched a new brutal suppression of French workers." "Daily Worker" correspondent in Paris, Staroding, commented: "Their arrest of Duclos is a shocking provocation against the French Communist Party... Mayer met with (American) Secretary of State Acheson on May 29th, and now his government is acting so recklessly, which is enough to show how quickly the North Atlantic Treaty is fascistizing France, and how the people's great resistance has made the warmongers very panicked."

(Xinhua News Agency, June 1st) According to TASS Rome: Italian democratic groups and working people are protesting the illegal arrest of Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.

Representatives of the Secretariat of the Italian National Peace Council, representing the sixteen million Italian people who signed the declaration demanding the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers, sent a telegram to the French Prime Minister and the French Ambassador in Rome, protesting the police suppression imposed on the French people. Leaders of the Italian peace movement demanded the immediate release of Duclos. In addition, the Secretariat of the Italian National Peace Council also sent a telegram to the French National Peace Council, expressing solidarity with the French people's struggle.

Pietro Nenni, leader of the Italian Socialist Party, also sent a telegram to Duclos on behalf of the Socialist Party, expressing solidarity.

The Rome Labor Association, the Metal Workers Federation, the Chemical Workers Federation, the Civil Servants Federation, the Agricultural Workers Federation, the Urban Transport Workers Federation, and the Food Industry Workers Federation all sent telegrams to the French Ambassador in Rome, protesting the illegal actions of the French authorities. Trade unions and other democratic groups in Milan and Turin also protested to the French consulates in those cities.

According to "L'Unità" (Unity): spontaneous strikes broke out on May 29th in enterprises in major industrial cities such as Turin, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Brindisi, Taranto, Ancona, and others to protest the arrest of Duclos and the French bloody police suppression. Workers stopped working and held rallies, at which many protest resolutions were passed, demanding that the French government release Duclos.

(Xinhua News Agency, June 1st) TASS Paris: "L'Humanité" published a letter of tribute from the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party to Duclos on May 31st. The Political Bureau's letter said: "We are very pleased to tell you that the people of France have risen up to fight for peace, and they firmly demand your immediate release." "L'Humanité" also published a statement by the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party on May 30th, which pointed out that the people's demonstration on May 28th protesting the arrival of American General Ridgway in Paris achieved great success and demonstrated the French people's determination to fight to the end for peace, against the French government and its American masters' policies of rearming West Germany and preparing for an anti-Soviet war. The Political Bureau's statement said that in Paris alone, more than 50,000 people participated in the demonstration. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, in addressing the arrest of Duclos, exposed the illegal nature of this violent act by the police authorities. The statement emphasized that this is a conspiracy by the French bourgeoisie against peace and against France.

    法共政治局发表向杜克洛的致敬信和声明
    【新华社三十一日讯】法国政府在其美国主子指使下非法逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛的暴行，已激起世界各国人民的愤怒抗议。匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西、意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂、德国共产党主席雷曼已先后致电法国共产党，抗议逮捕杜克洛，并声援法国人民争取和平与民族独立的斗争。
    由总书记拉科西署名的匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会拍发给法国共产党中央委员会的电报说：美帝国主义占领者及其法国走狗以这种卑鄙的谋害行动来反对法国工人阶级，反对法国的独立，反对和平事业。匈牙利人民万众一心，对逮捕这位法国人民伟大的儿子和自由战士，提出抗议。匈牙利劳动人民党表示声援兄弟的法国共产党，并祝它在为法国独立、为民主自由、为和平的斗争中获得胜利。匈牙利全国和平理事会、匈牙利法律工作者协会、匈牙利工会、劳动青年联盟中央委员会及其他群众性组织都致电法国政府表示抗议。连日以来，匈牙利各企业、各机关的群众不断举行集会，抗议杜克洛的被捕。
    在罗马尼亚，杜克洛被捕的消息发表以后，全国立即涌起了抗议的怒潮。二十九日，布加勒斯特“共和国”工厂工人举行大会，通过给法国比内政府的抗议电报，痛斥这种法西斯暴行，并要求立即释放杜克洛。三十日，布加勒斯特好几万工人、学生、妇女和青年举行了盛大的集会，抗议逮捕杜克洛。参加大会的群众高呼口号，表示坚决支援法国人民争取和平、独立，反对美国战争计划的斗争。罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团副主席、罗马尼亚保卫和平委员会常设委员会副主席康斯坦丁尼斯库—阿希在大会上发言说：法国人民信赖法国共产党，法国人民决不容许把法国变为美国的殖民地，决不容许把法国青年变成美帝国主义所准备的反对苏联和人民民主国家的侵略战争中的炮灰。大会一致决议致电法国共产党，表示声援。
