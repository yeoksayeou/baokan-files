Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has sent a telegram to Japanese workers, expressing support for their struggle against the bloody suppression by the Japanese government, and has also sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to express protest. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

    Telegram of Support to Japanese Workers
    To the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan,
    To the Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, Japanese worker brothers:
    The reactionary Japanese government, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, twice bloodily suppressed your actions of loving the motherland and defending peace on May 1st and May 30th. This exposes their fascist nature and their fear towards the power of the Japanese people. Your struggle for national independence, democracy, and freedom has won the sympathy of peace–loving peoples around the world. The strong will and spirit of unity you have demonstrated in the struggle are worthy of respect from people all over the world. We represent the entire Chinese working people in supporting your just struggle and wish you even greater victories.
                            All-China Federation of Trade Unions, June 6th

    Telegram of Protest to the Japanese Government
    To Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida:
    The bloodstains of the Japanese laboring people, peacefully demonstrating and brutally suppressed by Japanese police and American military police on May 1st, have not yet dried, and on May 30th, the Japanese people commemorating the "May 1st" martyrs were subjected to bloody atrocities. Chinese workers express great anger at the Japanese government's collusion with U.S. imperialism in massacring the Japanese people who love their country, love peace, and demand independence. The just actions of the Japanese people are bound to receive the support of peace–loving people all over the world, and they will surely achieve victory. This crime of the Japanese government, acting as a willing slave of U.S. imperialism, arresting and slaughtering the Japanese people, will inevitably be subject to the just sanctions of the people of the world.
                            All-China Federation of Trade Unions, June 6th

    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: TASS, Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," two hundred representatives of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan submitted to the Diet on the 4th a petition signed by 1,320,000 Japanese citizens protesting against the reactionary bills formulated by the Yoshida government.

    日本反动政府勾结美帝国主义在五月一日与三十日，两次对你们热爱祖国、保卫和平的行动进行血腥镇压，这暴露了他们法西斯的本质和对日本人民力量的惧怕。你们为争取民族独立、民主、自由的斗争，获得全世界爱好和平人民的同情。你们在斗争中所表现的坚强意志和团结精神，值得全世界人民敬佩。我们代表全中国劳动人民声援你们的正义斗争，并祝你们取得更大的胜利。
