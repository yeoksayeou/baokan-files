Summarizing and Promoting the Main Experiences of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method

Since liberation, tens of thousands of inventions and rationalization proposals have emerged in the textile industry, playing a significant role in production. Among these, the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method are the most outstanding. After the promotion of these two work methods, a mass movement to improve operating methods has been launched in the textile system, setting off an innovation movement in the textile industry.

Under the direct leadership of the Communist Party, with the strong support and cooperation of the administrative departments, and the active participation of the workers, the Textile Trade Union summarized and promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method. The Textile Trade Union has gained some experience from the work of summarizing and promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method.

I. Grasp the Central Links in Production and Summarize Advanced Experiences of Decisive Significance

The spinning and weaving workshops are two important departments in the textile production process. The spinning workshop is the final manufacturing process of the yarn factory. If the spinning operation method is poor, the labor results of the pre-spinning workers cannot be fully transformed into high-quality yarn, which will result in more cots, waste of manpower and materials, and increased costs. The weaving workshop is the final manufacturing process of the entire textile factory, and the waste will be even greater if substandard cloth is produced. Improving the operating methods of these two departments can promote the overall work and improve the overall production level. The workers in these two departments manage a relatively large number of machines, and the workers' operations must have certain rules in order to take the initiative, change the phenomenon of machines dominating people, and achieve the goal of reducing labor intensity and increasing labor productivity. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is in line with this principle. Therefore, the Textile Trade Union first helped the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union to summarize the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. While summarizing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, we prepared to summarize the weaving work method. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, we cooperated with the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government to summarize the 1951 Weaving Work Method. After the promotion of these two work methods, the output and quality of yarn and cloth have been greatly improved, and waste has been greatly reduced. At present, the national average cot rate has been reduced from 1.85% before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to 0.9%, and the output of cotton yarn has generally increased by 3% to 5%. After the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Work Method, substandard cloth has been greatly reduced, and many workers no longer weave substandard cloth. The output of cotton cloth has generally increased by more than 3%. The promotion of these two work methods has also promoted the improvement of operating methods in various departments. This situation fully illustrates that summarizing and promoting advanced experience must grasp the key issues in production.

II. Organize the Power of the Masses and Summarize the Creations of the Masses

Summarizing advanced experience is a scientific work. It is necessary to organize technicians to go to the workshop, use scientific methods to conduct specific measurement, analysis, and research, and then make correct conclusions after the workers' practice. This is the summary method of combining theory with practice and combining mental labor with physical labor. In order to summarize the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union organized a special committee including four engineers, more than 20 excellent spinning workers, and party, youth league, and trade union cadres. They repeatedly performed, measured, and researched in the workshop, and finally summarized a scientific spinning work method, namely the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The summary work of the 1951 Weaving Work Method was carried out in an organized and planned manner on the basis of preliminary summaries in various places, convening a weaving work method meeting, and gathering more than 100 weaving models, weaving experts, and administrative and trade union cadres from all over the country. The participants used the experience of summarizing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the Kovalev work method to analyze and compare the experiences created by the models in various places, eliminate the crude and retain the refined, and after 20 days of hard work, concentrated everyone's advantages and summarized the 1951 Weaving Work Method.

III. Vigorously, Systematically, and Organizedly Promote Advanced Experience

To make advanced experience everyone's experience and social wealth, the promotion work must be formed into a mass movement. The National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union first promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in Qingdao. After obtaining preliminary experience, it convened a spinning representative meeting and held a national training course to train teachers and backbones for the promotion work. Subsequently, all localities and factories organized promotion committees, held regional or factory training courses, trained a large number of "little teachers," organized promotion groups and inspection groups, and carried out large-scale promotion work, forming a broad mass movement. The promotion work of the 1951 Weaving Work Method used the experience of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The textile trade unions above the municipal level alone held 23 training courses on the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, training 1,924 students; and held 15 training courses on the 1951 Weaving Work Method, training 1,137 students. We relied on these students to vigorously carry out promotion work. Although we encountered some difficulties in the promotion, we finally overcame various difficulties under the leadership of the Party and the support of the administration, and promoted the new work methods.

IV. Launch Ideological Struggle and Overcome Various Conservative Ideas

The process of summarizing and promoting advanced experience is the process of struggle between new and old ideas, and it is also the process of criticizing and correcting erroneous ideas such as conservatism, subjectivism, and departmentalism. Some people not only turn a blind eye to the budding of new things, but also often refuse to accept new things or even deny new things. Without correcting these erroneous ideas, advanced experience cannot be summarized and promoted smoothly. When we summarized the new work methods, some technicians emphasized studying individual actions and did not pay attention to seeking work rules; some even misinterpreted the workers' practical experience and opposed the workers; some always felt that the experience in their area was better than other areas and were unwilling to humbly learn from others' experiences. These people cannot get rid of those outdated views or narrow experiences. Various localities criticized these erroneous views and repeatedly conducted experiments to educate them with facts, and finally corrected their erroneous ideas.

In the process of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method, we encountered resistance from various conservative ideas from workers, technicians, and cadres. Generally speaking, the workers' ideas are easy to get through, and the key is to get through the leadership's ideas. Some people said: "The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is nothing great, just beating the wiper board." "The 1951 Weaving Work Method has no new content, at most it is just turning around." Some technicians said: "No matter how good the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is, it will not be as perfect as the books." These people lack sensitivity to new things, and they refuse to accept new things. Some people emphasize objective difficulties, they say: "The new work method is good, but our equipment is not good, and the cotton is not good, so it cannot be promoted." They use various excuses to refuse to promote advanced experience. Some people say: "We are busy with work and have many tasks, so we can't take care of promoting advanced experience." Or say: "Promoting advanced experience hinders the central work." They oppose promoting advanced experience and completing work tasks. Therefore, to this day, in some areas, these two work methods have not been promoted in an organized manner, and some comrades do not even support the spontaneous learning of the masses. There are also some people who want to promote advanced experience, but they feel that "promoting their own is always better than promoting others." They say: "I also have this kind of work method here, why must I promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method?" They are unwilling to absorb advanced experience from multiple aspects. To make the promotion of advanced experience a mass movement and make it effective, the trade union must be good at obtaining the support of the Party leadership and the administration, promptly criticize and correct various erroneous ideas, and carry out arduous educational work. Experience has proved that factories that have solved ideological problems have done a good job in promotion, otherwise they will accomplish nothing. The Qingdao No. 8 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, under the control of the leadership's erroneous ideas, implemented its own set of methods, and even overturned the 1951 Weaving Work Method that had begun to be promoted in the factory, making the original achievements vanish. This is a typical example.

V. Timely Check the Promotion of Advanced Experience and Solve Newly Occurring Problems

After the advanced experience is promoted, it must be checked in a timely manner to correct various deviations and enable the workers to truly master the advanced experience. After the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau and the Northeast District Committee of the China Textile Trade Union universally checked the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in various factories, they found that there was still serious formalism in the promotion work in some factories, and the operating actions of the spinning workers in various factories were very inconsistent. They held a Hao Jianxiu Work Method rectification and training class, and transferred cadres and "little teachers" from various factories who were responsible for promotion to conduct rectification and training, so that cadres and "little teachers" could correctly grasp the basic spirit and characteristics of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. This played a great role in further promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. During the rectification and training period, they also formulated uniform measurement forms, scoring methods, and drafted preliminary reward systems. The experience of the Northeast in holding rectification and training classes is worth learning from in various places.

After the masses master the advanced experience, they will inevitably further use their brains and find tricks. It is necessary to check and summarize in a timely manner, concentrate the new creations of the masses, and continuously enrich and develop the advanced experience. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method have been continuously improved in this way.

After the advanced experience is promoted, it will inevitably cause a series of new problems. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method, the output and quality have been greatly improved, and the original production standards, labor organization, and wage standards have been broken through. Supply problems have also occurred in some factories. This phenomenon is inevitable. This is not a bad phenomenon. But these problems must be solved, labor organization must be improved, and production standards and technical quotas must be changed to catch up with all the work, otherwise these contradictions will become obstacles to our production reform. Therefore, the trade union must check the promotion work, timely discover the problems that have occurred after the promotion of advanced experience, organize the masses to find solutions, and assist the administration to solve them, so as to further deepen the work of promoting advanced experience.

    总结和推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法的主要经验
    解放以来，纺织工业中出现了数以万计的发明创造、合理化建议，对生产起了很大作用。其中以郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法最为杰出。这两个工作法推广以后，已在纺织系统中掀起了群众性的改进操作方法的热潮，掀起了纺织工业中的革新运动。
    纺织工会在共产党的直接领导、行政方面的大力支持和配合、以及职工群众的积极参加下，总结和推广了郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法。纺织工会从总结和推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法的工作中，取得了一些经验。
    一、抓住生产上的中心环节，总结出有决定意义的先进经验
    细纱和织布两个车间，是纺织生产过程中的两个重要部门。细纱车间是纱厂的最后制造过程，细纱操作方法不良，就不能把前纺工人的劳动成果全部变成品质优良的纱，就会多出皮辊花，浪费了人力物力，提高了成本。织布车间是整个纺织厂的最后制造过程，如果出了次布，浪费就更大了。改善了这两个部门的操作方法，就可以推动全盘工作，提高整个生产水平。这两个部门的工人管理的机台比较多，工人操作必须有一定的规律，才能争取主动，改变机器支配人的现象，才能达到减轻劳动强度，提高劳动生产率的目的。郝建秀工作法是合乎这个原则的。因此，纺织工会首先帮助华东纺织管理局青岛分局和中国纺织工会青岛市委员会，总结出郝建秀工作法。在总结郝建秀工作法的同时，就准备总结织布工作法。郝建秀工作法推广后，我们就配合中央人民政府纺织工业部，总结出一九五一织布工作法。这两个工作法推广以后，纱布的产量、质量便大大提高，浪费大大减少。目前全国平均皮辊花率已由推广郝建秀工作法前的百分之一点八五降低至百分之零点九，棉纱产量一般的增加了百分之三至百分之五。一九五一织布工作法推广后，次布已大大减少，许多工人已不再织次布了。棉布产量一般的提高了百分之三以上。由于这两个工作法的推广，又推动了各个部门，改进了操作方法。这种情况，充分说明了总结和推广先进经验，必须抓住生产中的关键问题。
    二、组织群众的力量，总结群众的创造
    总结先进经验，这是一种科学的工作。必须组织技术人员到车间去，运用科学的方法，进行具体的测定、分析、研究，再经过工人的实践，才能做出正确的结论。这就是理论和实践相结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的总结方法。为了总结郝建秀工作法，华东纺织管理局青岛分局、中国纺织工会青岛市委员会曾经组织了包括四位工程师、二十多个优秀的细纱工作者和党、青年团、工会干部的专门委员会。他们在车间里进行反复的表演、测定、研究，最后总结出了科学的细纱工作法，即郝建秀工作法。一九五一织布工作法的总结工作，是在各地初步总结的基础上，召开织布工作法会议，集中了全国各地织布模范、织布专家和行政干部、工会干部一百多人，有组织有计划地进行的。到会人员运用总结郝建秀工作法的经验和郭瓦廖夫工作方法，将各地模范们所创造的经验加以分析比较，去粗取精，经过二十天的艰苦工作，集中了大家的优点，总结成了一九五一织布工作法。
    三、大张旗鼓，有计划有组织地推广先进经验
    要使先进经验成为大家的经验和社会财富，就必须使推广工作形成群众性的运动。中国纺织工会全国委员会首先在青岛推广郝建秀工作法，取得初步经验后，召开了细纱代表会，举办全国性的训练班，以便培养教员和推广工作的骨干。接着，各地各厂都组织了推广委员会，举办了地区或厂的训练班，培养了大批的“小先生”，组织了推广组、检查组，进行大规模的推广工作，形成了广泛的群众运动。一九五一织布工作法的推广工作，就运用了推广郝建秀工作法的经验。仅市以上的纺织工会，就举办了二十三期郝建秀工作法学习班，训练了一千九百二十四个学员；举办了十五期一九五一织布工作法学习班，训练了一千一百三十七个学员。我们依靠这些学员，大张旗鼓地进行推广工作，虽然在推广中遇到一些困难，但在党的领导和行政的支持下，终于克服了各种困难，推广了新的工作方法。
    四、展开思想斗争，克服各种保守思想
    总结和推广先进经验的过程，就是新旧思想斗争的过程，也就是批判和纠正保守思想、主观主义、本位主义等错误思想的过程。有些人不但对新事物的萌芽熟视无睹，而且常常拒绝接受新事物甚至不承认新事物。不纠正这些错误思想，就不能顺利地总结和推广先进经验。在我们总结新工作法时，部分技术人员强调研究个别动作，不注意寻求工作规律；有的人甚至曲解工人的实际经验，和工人对立起来；有的人总觉得他那个地区的经验比其他地区好，不愿虚心学习别人的经验。这些人摆脱不了那些业已陈旧的观点或狭隘经验。各地针对这些错误观点进行了批判，反复地进行试验，以事实来教育他们，终于纠正了他们的错误思想。
    在推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法的过程中，又遇到了来自工人群众、技术人员以及干部中的各种各样保守思想的抵抗。一般的说，工人群众的思想是容易打通的，问题的关键在于打通领导思想。有人说：“郝建秀工作法没有什么了不起，只是打打擦板而已。”“一九五一织布工作法并没有什么新内容，顶多是转转圈子。”有些技术人员说：“郝建秀工作法再好也不会有书本上的完善。”这些人缺乏对新鲜事物的敏感，他们拒绝接受新事物。有的人则强调客观困难，他们说：“新工作法好是好，不过我们这里设备不好，棉花不好，推行不了。”他们用各种借口拒绝推广先进经验。有人说：“工作忙，任务多，顾不上推广先进经验。”或者说：“推广先进经验妨碍中心工作。”他们把推广先进经验和完成工作任务对立起来。因此，至今在某些地区，这两个工作法还没有有组织地推广，有些同志甚至对群众自发的学习也不支持。还有一些人是要推广先进经验的，但他们觉得“推广自己的总比推广别人的强”。他们说：“这种工作法我这里也有，何必一定要推广郝建秀工作法呢？”他们不愿意从多方面吸取先进经验。要把推广先进经验形成群众性的运动，使之收到实效，工会必须善于取得党的领导和行政的支持，及时地批判和纠正各种错误思想，进行艰苦的教育工作。经验证明，凡是解决了思想问题的厂，推广工作就做得好，反之必然一无所成。国营青岛第八棉纺织厂，就在领导人员错误思想的支配下，实行了自己的一套，竟把已在该厂开始推广的一九五一织布工作法全部推翻，使原已取得的成绩化为乌有。这就是一个典型的例子。
    五、及时检查先进经验的推广情况，解决新发生的问题
    先进经验推广以后，必须及时进行检查，纠正各种偏差，使工人真正掌握先进经验。东北纺织管理局和中国纺织工会东北区委员会普遍检查了各厂推广郝建秀工作法的情况以后，发现有些厂的推广工作还存在着严重的形式主义，各厂细纱工人的操作动作很不统一。他们举办了郝建秀工作法整训班，抽调了各厂负责推广工作的干部和“小先生”进行整训，使干部和“小先生”都能正确地掌握郝建秀工作法的基本精神和特点。这对进一步推广郝建秀工作法起了很大作用。在整训期间，他们还制订了统一的测定表格，评分办法，并拟订了初步的奖励制度。东北举办整训班的经验，值得各地学习。
    群众掌握先进经验后，必然会进一步开动脑筋、找出窍门。必须及时进行检查总结，把群众新的创造集中起来，使先进经验不断地充实和发展。郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法就是这样不断提高的。
    先进经验推广后，必然引起一系列的新问题。郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布工作法推广后，产量、质量大大提高，原来的生产标准、劳动组织、工资标准都被突破了。有的厂前后供应也发生了问题。这种现象是必然的。这并不是坏现象。但这些问题必须解决，劳动组织必须改善，生产标准、技术定额必须改变，使全部工作赶上去，否则这些矛盾就成了我们生产改革的障碍。因此，工会必须检查推广工作的情形，及时发现先进经验推广后所发生的问题，组织群众想办法，并协助行政加以解决，使推广先进经验的工作更深入一步。
