    The ten agricultural production cooperatives experimentally operated in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province in 1951 have been further developed by implementing the policy of "seeking development through consolidation." After the autumn harvest last year, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of the heads, accountants, labor team leaders of each cooperative, and relevant district cadres to summarize the pre-autumn production work and to arrange the winter production work. After the meeting, the local committee continued to send cadres to help these ten agricultural production cooperatives, so that they could be consolidated and developed with leadership and planning. In the five months from November last year to the end of March this year, through winter production and spring ploughing and drought prevention work, except for the relatively poor development of the Wuxiang and Jianzhang cooperatives, the other eight cooperatives have moved forward. In order to enable these ten agricultural production cooperatives to achieve greater results in 1952, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of county and district cadres assisting these ten cooperatives in March this year to review the work of the previous stage and study the production work for 1952.
    I. The Situation of Consolidation and Development
    In the past five months, these ten agricultural production cooperatives and their members have improved in production, organization, and ideology compared to 1951.
    First, in terms of production: These ten cooperatives have achieved great success in winter sideline production. A total of 40,098,700 yuan of capital was raised by the ten cooperatives, establishing twelve oil mills and flour mills. At the same time, they engaged in handicraft production such as felt making, carpentry, weaving, and contracting to build kilns, earning a profit of 33,600,000 yuan. This improved the lives of the members and greatly supported agricultural production.
    The preparatory work for agricultural production in these ten cooperatives has been even more remarkable. First, last winter, they formulated a production increase plan for 1952: requiring an increase to 354 jin per mu on the basis of the average grain output of 300 jin per mu in 1951; among them, the Guo Yu'en, Cui Wulin, Bao Rensuo, and Cao Linshui cooperatives increased the average yield per mu by more than 70 jin, the Dong Taoqi cooperative increased by 108 jin, and the Wei Mingbiao cooperative increased by 54 jin; the Wang Chengxi, Feng Haike, Chen Erming, and Wang Jinyun cooperatives increased the average yield by 25 jin (recently studied and prepared to increase it appropriately). The ten cooperatives also designated 81 mu of land as high-yield land (3 to 10 mu per cooperative), with special processing and fertilization, managed by special personnel, requiring an average grain yield of 746 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 1,200 jin, exceeding the general land yield by 110 percent. The ten cooperatives also demarcated 112.1 mu of land for seed retention and small farms to improve varieties. Second, water conservancy projects have been developed. The ten cooperatives dug a total of 27 wells, built 7 canals, and also built through-river wells, through-pond wells, reservoirs, and water storage ponds, turning 774 mu of dry land into paddy fields (accounting for about 30 percent of the total land of the ten cooperatives, averaging 0.8 mu per person). Thirty-four dry wells, eighteen dry canals, and thirty-three dry ponds were dug, which can irrigate a total of 433 mu of land. Third, due to the increase in sheep flocks, oil mills, and flour mills in the cooperatives, fertilizer has become more abundant. Five cooperatives plan to apply more than 100 dan of fertilizer per mu, and two cooperatives plan to apply more than 90 dan of fertilizer per mu. Although two cooperatives were restricted by natural conditions, the amount of fertilizer applied was also much higher than last year, reaching more than 60 dan per mu. The quality of fertilizers used by these cooperatives this year has improved compared to the past. For example, in the Wang Chengxi cooperative, sheep manure accounted for 64.7 percent of the total amount of various fertilizers, pen manure accounted for 21.1 percent, human and animal urine accounted for 2.4 percent, sesame cake accounted for 3.4 percent, and soil fertilizer only accounted for 8.3 percent. Fourth, each cooperative harrowed the land twice, ensuring timely sowing. Fifth, each cooperative has weeded 6,702 mu of wheat seedlings, accounting for 60 percent of the total wheat land. Sixth, the seeds used by each cooperative were uniformly selected and retained by the cooperative last autumn, and stored centrally, and have all been dried and disinfected. Seventh, cooperatives near mountainous areas have developed forestry and animal husbandry. The Guo Yu'en cooperative planted and survived ten trees per person, and the agricultural production cooperative afforested 40 mu and cultivated a nursery of half a mu; the Dong Taoqi cooperative planted and survived 800 timber trees and 120 production trees, and specially transplanted 2,000 large-leaf poplar trees and afforested 10 mu. The sheep flocks and livestock of each cooperative have increased.
    In the production process of these five months, the agricultural production cooperatives implemented unified planning and collective management, further leveraging the potential power of land and labor. Some things that could not be done in the past have now been done in a very short time. The Guo Yu'en cooperative has a total of 130 mu of river滩land that needs to be repaired and improved. In the past, each household operated separately, and everyone's thoughts were inconsistent, and this problem had not been solved for more than 30 years. In 1947, they had planned to improve it, but because three households did not agree, work could not start. This year, these households have all joined the agricultural production cooperative, and under the unified planning and management of the agricultural production cooperative, a large canal was repaired in five days. From then on, this 100+ mu of land can increase the production of fine grain by 30 shi per year.
    Second, in terms of organizational construction: First, improve leadership methods. After the autumn harvest last year, each cooperative conducted an appraisal and re-election of cadres. In the process of appraisal and re-election, democracy was generally promoted, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and models were also selected. Forty-seven cadres, headed by the head of the cooperative, were re-elected in the ten cooperatives, and twenty-four cadres (six deputy heads, three accountants, and fifteen team leaders) were not elected due to ineffective leadership and poor style. This strengthened the democratic life within the cooperative, improved the style of the cadres, and strengthened the leadership. From then on, the cadres and members united as one and worked hard to carry out production. This is one of the basic conditions for ensuring good production in 1952. Second, the division of labor and responsibility system within the cooperative is more sound than in 1951. The heads and deputy heads are divided into labor for production, political and cultural education, and sideline production, and so are each team leader. The accountant has a general accountant and a sub-accountant (the sub-accountant is the oil mill accountant, the flour mill accountant, etc.), and there are also professionals in charge of storage, technology, management of economic crops, management of small farms, and management of high-yield land. Third, the system has been further reviewed and approved. Some cooperatives have established a family representative meeting system, which can democratically discuss issues and reduce the number of meetings of cooperative members. The Guo Yu'en cooperative has stipulated a system of holding an "patriotic day" every half month, during which work is reviewed while enjoying collective entertainment. The Wang Chengxi cooperative has established a three-level accounting system for individuals, teams, and accountants, regularly checking accounts and settling accounts, so that it is clear. In short, various systems are gradually becoming rationalized.
    Third, in terms of political and cultural learning: All ten cooperatives have established a learning system; and it has been determined that the deputy head and deputy team leader are specifically responsible for leadership. The ten cooperatives have subscribed to a total of 40 copies of the Shanxi Daily, Shanxi Peasant Daily, Shanxi Pictorial, Youth Daily, and Women's Daily, averaging four copies per cooperative; and each cooperative has established a cooperative school as a place for collective learning. Ninety-two members of the ten cooperatives serve as propagandists, explaining current events to everyone at any time. In the past five months, 85 percent of the members have received 15 educations. Therefore, everyone's political enthusiasm is often full, and patriotic pacts have been generally revised. In terms of cultural learning, in the past five months, 192 people in the ten cooperatives have newly recognized 10 to 100 Chinese characters, and 316 people have recognized more than 100 Chinese characters. The young and middle-aged people in the Guo Yu'en cooperative can all learn to write simple letters and record work.
    Due to the continuous achievements in production and the strengthening of political and ideological education, the collectivist thinking of the members has been further improved. The public property and public accumulation funds of the ten cooperatives have increased greatly, including: the number of houses has increased from five to nine, the number of livestock has increased from 17 to 49 (four mules, four horses, nine donkeys, and 32 cattle), the amount of land has increased from 31.6 mu to 63.5 mu, and the number of agricultural implements has increased from 171 pieces (63 new-style agricultural implements) to 504 pieces (73 new-style agricultural implements). The public accumulation fund has increased by 4,132 jin of grain compared to last year. The flock of sheep has increased from 441 to 737. The number of pigs has increased from 41 to 50.
    In the past five months, agricultural production cooperatives have further demonstrated their superiority and have been more loved by the vast number of peasants. Therefore, all ten cooperatives have developed. The ten cooperatives originally had 190 member households, now increased to 246 households; the original number of people was 779, now increased to 965; the original number of livestock was 94, now increased to 113; the original amount of land was 1,400 mu, now increased to 2,637 mu.
    II. Three Major Experiences
    First, overcoming the complacency of cadres and members and solving problems in a timely manner is an important link in consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives. These ten cooperatives achieved great results in production in 1951, and when distributing production materials in the autumn, they were fair and reasonable, and the members were very satisfied. The masses outside the cooperative were very envious of the agricultural production cooperative, which laid the foundation for consolidating and developing the cooperative. At this time, some cadres in the county, district, village, and cooperative had a sense of pride and complacency, thinking that "there is no problem." Some counties withdrew cadres who were helping agricultural production cooperatives; some cooperatives were preparing to open the door wide and expand the members unconditionally; some cooperatives were content with the status quo and prepared to close the door and no longer develop. Under the influence of this complacency, some cadres and members of the cooperatives ignored many problems that urgently needed to be solved in the cooperative, which once affected the consolidation of the cooperative. The higher-level leading organs of each cooperative paid timely attention to these problems, strengthened leadership, pointed out the serious significance of consolidating the cooperative, emphasized overcoming complacency, and gained experience in consolidating the cooperative. Each cooperative began to attach importance to consolidation work. The Chen Erming cooperative suffered insect damage to cotton and suffered losses, and the members were emotionally turbulent. After the distribution of production fruits, some members were not completely settled down. The county and district cadres paid attention to this problem and led the cooperative to do a good job in winter production. As a result, not only did no household withdraw from the cooperative, but also 17 members were developed.
    Second, with the development of production, according to the needs of production and the requirements of members, gradually resolving the contradictions between unified management and individual ownership of means of production under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit is the key to raising the cooperative to a higher level. In 1951, most of these ten cooperatives hired livestock from members, and farm implements were also brought by the members themselves. In this way, many problems were constantly exposed in production. For example, livestock were only hired by the cooperative during the busy farming season, and the cooperative did not care about them during the slack season, which caused dissatisfaction among households with livestock. Farm implements were brought by the members themselves and shared by everyone. If they were broken, no one would repair them, and people with farm implements were very dissatisfied. Therefore, it has become everyone's common requirement for means of production to enter the cooperative with land and labor. This year, these ten cooperatives have begun to solve these problems. In terms of livestock, the following solutions have been adopted: one is to buy spot goods with cash to buy the members' livestock into the cooperative. Cooperatives with better economic conditions and sufficient funds have adopted this method. One is to apportion capital shares according to the mu of land and buy the members' livestock into the cooperative. Members who can pay immediately will pay immediately, and those who have difficulties will repay after the summer harvest, autumn harvest, or next year, and pay a small amount of interest. Individual cooperatives with very difficult economic conditions still use the method of private ownership and public employment, and prepare to change it after production is further improved. In terms of agricultural implements: This year, each cooperative has changed to large agricultural implements being valued and entering the cooperative, small agricultural implements are brought by themselves, and the cooperative repairs them if they are broken, and stipulates depreciation fees and sets up a special person to manage them. Fertilizers are mainly solved by planned powder factories to raise pigs, oil factories to earn bean cake, buying sheep manure, and collective composting. When fertilizers are insufficient, the cooperative purchases fertilizers from individual members. This practice is a step forward compared to last year's method of bringing fertilizers according to mu of land. In order to further solve the fertilizer problem within the cooperative, all the sheep flocks owned by the members of each cooperative are gradually transferred to the cooperative.
    Third, strengthening democratic management is an important method for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Last year, there were more or less undemocratic phenomena in the management of each cooperative. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the cadres of the cooperative stipulate systems and disciplines and hand them over to the members for implementation; the economic accounts are not made public or are not announced in a timely manner, and so on. There are also a few cooperatives that are contracted by district cadres. Therefore, some members believe that the cooperative is "the public's cooperative" and "the head of the cooperative's cooperative," which affects the members' enthusiasm for production. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the ten cooperatives conducted a democratic appraisal, democratic re-election, and model selection after the distribution of production products last autumn, and improved the leadership within the cooperative. At the same time, it also stipulated a system of re-election once a year and inspection once a quarter. Some unreasonable systems have been revised. This has strengthened the relationship between the cadres and members of the cooperative, enhanced the members' sense of responsibility to the cooperative, and the members' enthusiasm for production has been further increased. This is an important factor in the significant achievements in production of the ten cooperatives in the past five months.

    山西长治专区试办的十个农业生产合作社是巩固和发展的
    陈国宝
    山西省长治专区一九五一年试办的十个农业生产合作社，贯彻在“巩固中求发展”的方针，得到了进一步的发展。中共长治地方委员会在去年秋收以后，召开各社社长、会计、劳动小组长及有关的区干部的联席会议，总结秋前生产工作，布置冬季生产工作。会后，地委继续派干部帮助这十个农业生产合作社，使它们有领导、有计划地巩固和发展起来。自去年十一月到今年三月底的五个月中，经过冬季生产和春耕防旱工作，除武乡、监漳两社发展较差以外，其余八个社都向前发展了一步。为使这十个农业生产合作社在一九五二年取得更大成绩，中共长治地方委员会又在今年三月召集帮助这十个社的县区干部开会，检查了前一阶段的工作，研究了一九五二年的生产工作。
    一、巩固和发展的情况
    五个月来，这十个农业生产合作社及其社员，在生产上、组织上、思想上都比一九五一年提高了一步。
    第一、生产方面：这十个社的冬季副业生产，取得了巨大成绩。总计十个社共集起四千零九十八万七千元的资本，建立油坊、粉坊十二座，同时经营毡坊、木铺、编织、包工打窑等手工业生产，获利达三千三百六十万元。这就改善了社员的生活，同时大大支援了农业生产。
    这十个社的农业生产的准备工作，成绩更加显著。一、在去年冬天，他们就订出了一九五二年的增产计划：要求在一九五一年每亩平均产粮三百斤的基础上，增加到三百五十四斤；其中郭玉恩、崔五林、暴仁锁、曹林水四个社，每亩平均增产七十斤以上，董桃气社增产一百零八斤，魏明标社增产五十四斤；王成喜、冯海科、陈二明、王锦云四个社平均增产二十五斤（最近研究准备再适当提高）。十个社并确定用八十一亩地为丰产地（每社三亩到十亩），特别加工加肥，由专人管理，要求每亩平均产粮七百四十六斤，最高达到一千二百斤，超过一般土地产量百分之一百一十。十个社又划出留种地及小农场地一百一十二亩一分，以改良品种。二、发展了水利事业。十个社共打井二十七眼，修建水渠七条，还修建了透河井、透池井、蓄水池、水库等，使七百七十四亩旱地变为水田（占十个社全部入社地约百分之三十，每人平均八分地）。打旱井三十四眼，旱渠十八条，旱池三十三个，共可浇地四百三十三亩。三、由于社内羊群、油坊、粉坊较前增多，肥料更充足了。有五个社计划每亩施肥一百担以上，两个社计划每亩施肥九十担以上。有两个社虽受自然条件限制，施肥量也大大超过去年，每亩施肥达六十多担。今年这些社施用的肥料的质量，比较过去提高。例如，王成喜社的羊肥占各种肥料总数的百分之六十四点七，圈肥占百分之二十一点一，人粪尿占百分之二点四，麻饼占百分之三点四，土肥只占百分之八点三。四、各社耙地二次，保证了按时播种。五、各社已锄麦苗六千七百零二亩，占总麦地的百分之六十。六、各社所用种籽，去年秋天由社统一选留，集中保存，都经过翻晒消毒。七、靠近山区的社，发展了林牧业。郭玉恩社每人栽活十株树，农业生产合作社并造林四十亩，育苗圃半亩；董桃气社栽活八百株木材树，一百二十株生产树，并专门移植大叶杨树二千株，造林十亩。各社羊群牲畜，都增加了。
    各农业生产合作社在这五个月的生产过程中，实行统一计划，集体经营，更发挥了土地、劳力的潜在力量。有些历来办不到的事，现在都在很短的时间内办到了。郭玉恩社共有一百三十亩河滩地需要修整和改良。过去各户分散经营，大家心思不一致，这个问题三十多年都没有解决。一九四七年，他们曾经计划加以改良，但因有三户不同意，还是不能开工。今年这些户全部入了农业生产合作社，在农业生产合作社统一计划统一经营下，用五天时间，修好一道大渠，从此，这一百多亩地，每年可增产细粮三十石。
    第二、组织建设方面：一、改进领导方法。去年秋收以后，各社对干部进行了一次鉴定和改选。在鉴定和改选过程中，普遍发扬了民主，展开了批评与自我批评，还评选了模范。十个社以社长为首的四十七个干部连选连任，二十四个干部（副社长六人，会计三人，小组长十五人）因领导不力、作风不好而落选。这就增强了社内的民主生活，改进了干部作风，充实了领导力量。从此，干部社员团结一致，加劲进行生产。这是保证一九五二年搞好生产的基本条件之一。二、社内的分工负责制比一九五一年更健全了。正副社长按生产、政治文化教育、副业生产进行分工，每个小组长也是这样。会计有总会计和分会计（分会计是油坊会计，粉坊会计等），还设有保管、技术、管理经济作物、管理小农场、管理丰产地等的专业人员。三、进一步审订了制度。有些社建立了家庭代表会议制度，既可民主商定问题，又减少了社员大会。郭玉恩社规定了半月举行一次“爱国日”的制度，在这一天，一面集体娱乐，一面检查工作。王成喜社建立了个人、小组、会计三级记帐制度，定期对帐，定期算帐，作到清清楚楚。总之，各种制度逐渐合理化了。
    第三、政治和文化学习方面：十个社都建立了学习制度；并确定由副社长、副组长专门负责领导。十个社共订有山西日报、山西农民报、山西画报、青年报、妇女报等四十份，每社平均四份；各社并且建立了社校，作为集体学习场所。十个社有九十二个社员担任宣传员，随时向大家讲解时事。五个月来，已有百分之八十五的社员受到了十五次教育。因此，大家的政治情绪经常饱满，普遍修订了爱国公约。在文化学习方面，五个月来，十个社新识生字十个到一百个的已有一百九十二人，识生字一百字以上的有三百一十六人，郭玉恩社的青壮年，都会学写简单的信和记工了。
    由于生产上不断获得成绩和加强了政治思想教育，社员的集体主义思想已进一步提高了。十个社的公共财产、公积金已经大量增加，计：房屋由五间增到九间，牲口由十七头增加到四十九头（骡四头、马四头、驴九头、牛三十二头），土地由三十一点六亩增加到六十三点五亩，农具由一百七十一件（新式农具六十三件）增加到五百零四件（新式农具七十三件）。公积金比去年增加了四千一百三十二斤粮食。羊群由四百四十一只增加到七百三十七只。猪由四十一只增到五十只。
    五个月来，农业生产合作社进一步显示了它的优越性，更加受到了广大农民的爱戴。因此，十个社都发展了。十个社原有社员一百九十户，现在增加到二百四十六户；原有人数七百七十九人，现在增加到九百六十五人；原有牲畜九十四头，现在增加到一百一十三头；原有土地一千四百亩，现在增加到二千六百三十七亩。
    二、三项主要的经验
    第一、克服干部和社员的自满情绪，及时解决问题，是巩固和发展农业生产合作社的重要环节。这十个社在一九五一年的生产成绩很大，秋季分配生产物时，又做到了公平合理，社员都很满意，社外群众对农业生产合作社十分羡慕，这给巩固和发展合作社打下了基础。这时候，有些县、区、村社的干部，产生了骄傲自满情绪，认为“没啥问题啦”。有的县撤走了帮助农业生产合作社的干部；有的社准备大开门无条件地扩大社员；有的社安于现状，准备关起大门，不再发展。在这种自满情绪的影响下，有些社的干部和社员忽视了社内急待解决的许多问题，曾一度影响了社的巩固。各社的上级领导机关及时注意了这些问题加强领导，指出巩固社的严重意义，强调克服自满情绪，取得了巩固社的经验。各社开始重视巩固工作。陈二明社的棉花遭受虫害，受了损失，社员情绪动荡，分配生产果实以后，有一部分社员还没有完全安定下来。县区干部注意了这个问题，领导该社搞好了冬季生产，结果，不但没有一户退社的，还发展了十七户社员。
    第二、随着生产的发展，根据生产的需要和社员的要求，在自愿互利的原则下，逐步解决统一经营和生产资料个人占有的矛盾，这是把合作社提高一步的关键。在一九五一年这十个社多半是向社员雇用牲口，农具也是由社员自带，这样，在生产中不断地暴露了许多问题。例如，牲口只在农忙时由社雇用，农闲时社内不管，以致引起有牲口户的不满。农具由社员自带，大家共用，坏了无人修理，有农具的人很不满意。因此，生产资料随土地、劳力入社，便成为大家的共同要求。今年这十个社已着手解决这些问题。在牲口方面，采取了以下几种解决办法：一种是现钱买现货，把社员的牲口买入社内。经济条件较好，资金比较充足的社，都采用了这种办法。一种是按地亩摊资本股，把社员的牲口买入社内，社员能够马上出钱的就马上出钱，有困难的在夏收、秋收后或下年偿还，并出少数利息。个别经济条件十分困难的社，仍然采用私有公雇的办法，准备生产进一步提高以后再加以改变。在农具方面：各社今年改为大农具作价入社，小农具自带，坏了由社修补，并规定了折旧费，设专人保管。肥料主要依靠有计划地开粉房喂猪，开油房赚豆饼，买羊积粪和集体沤粪等办法来解决。肥料不足时，由社收买社员个人的肥料。这种作法，比去年按地亩带肥料的办法进了一步。为了进一步解决社内的肥料问题，各社社员所有羊群，也逐渐转入社内。
    第三、加强民主管理是巩固农业生产合作社的重要方法。去年各社在管理方面，或多或少地存在着不够民主的现象。这主要表现在社的干部规定制度、纪律，交社员执行；经济账目不公开或不及时公布，等等。还有少数社是被区干部包办的。因此，有的社员认为社是“公家的社”、“社长的社”，影响了社员生产积极性。为克服这一缺点，十个社在去年秋季分配生产品后，进行了一次民主鉴定、民主改选和评选模范的工作，改进了社内的领导。同时还规定了一年一改选，每季一检查的制度。在账目方面，规定十天一对账，一季一公布。一些不合理的制度，都修改了。这就密切了社内干部和社员的关系，增强了社员对社的责任心，社员生产热情更加高涨。这是五个月来十个社生产获得显著成绩的一个重要因素。
