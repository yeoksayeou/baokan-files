    The ten agricultural production cooperatives experimentally operated in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province in 1951 have been further developed by implementing the policy of "seeking development through consolidation." After the autumn harvest last year, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a joint meeting of the heads, accountants, labor team leaders of each cooperative, and relevant district cadres to summarize the pre-autumn production work and to arrange the winter production work. After the meeting, the local committee continued to send cadres to help these ten agricultural production cooperatives, so that they could be consolidated and developed with leadership and planning. In the five months from November last year to the end of March this year, through winter production and spring ploughing and drought prevention work, except for the relatively poor development of the Wuxiang and Jianzhang cooperatives, the other eight cooperatives have moved forward. In order to enable these ten agricultural production cooperatives to achieve greater results in 1952, the Changzhi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of county and district cadres assisting these ten cooperatives in March this year to review the work of the previous stage and study the production work for 1952.
    I. The Situation of Consolidation and Development
    In the past five months, these ten agricultural production cooperatives and their members have improved in production, organization, and ideology compared to 1951.
    First, in terms of production: These ten cooperatives have achieved great success in winter sideline production. A total of 40,098,700 yuan of capital was raised by the ten cooperatives, establishing twelve oil mills and flour mills. At the same time, they engaged in handicraft production such as felt making, carpentry, weaving, and contracting to build kilns, earning a profit of 33,600,000 yuan. This improved the lives of the members and greatly supported agricultural production.
    The preparatory work for agricultural production in these ten cooperatives has been even more remarkable. First, last winter, they formulated a production increase plan for 1952: requiring an increase to 354 jin per mu on the basis of the average grain output of 300 jin per mu in 1951; among them, the Guo Yu'en, Cui Wulin, Bao Rensuo, and Cao Linshui cooperatives increased the average yield per mu by more than 70 jin, the Dong Taoqi cooperative increased by 108 jin, and the Wei Mingbiao cooperative increased by 54 jin; the Wang Chengxi, Feng Haike, Chen Erming, and Wang Jinyun cooperatives increased the average yield by 25 jin (recently studied and prepared to increase it appropriately). The ten cooperatives also designated 81 mu of land as high-yield land (3 to 10 mu per cooperative), with special processing and fertilization, managed by special personnel, requiring an average grain yield of 746 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 1,200 jin, exceeding the general land yield by 110 percent. The ten cooperatives also demarcated 112.1 mu of land for seed retention and small farms to improve varieties. Second, water conservancy projects have been developed. The ten cooperatives dug a total of 27 wells, built 7 canals, and also built through-river wells, through-pond wells, reservoirs, and water storage ponds, turning 774 mu of dry land into paddy fields (accounting for about 30 percent of the total land of the ten cooperatives, averaging 0.8 mu per person). Thirty-four dry wells, eighteen dry canals, and thirty-three dry ponds were dug, which can irrigate a total of 433 mu of land. Third, due to the increase in sheep flocks, oil mills, and flour mills in the cooperatives, fertilizer has become more abundant. Five cooperatives plan to apply more than 100 dan of fertilizer per mu, and two cooperatives plan to apply more than 90 dan of fertilizer per mu. Although two cooperatives were restricted by natural conditions, the amount of fertilizer applied was also much higher than last year, reaching more than 60 dan per mu. The quality of fertilizers used by these cooperatives this year has improved compared to the past. For example, in the Wang Chengxi cooperative, sheep manure accounted for 64.7 percent of the total amount of various fertilizers, pen manure accounted for 21.1 percent, human and animal urine accounted for 2.4 percent, sesame cake accounted for 3.4 percent, and soil fertilizer only accounted for 8.3 percent. Fourth, each cooperative harrowed the land twice, ensuring timely sowing. Fifth, each cooperative has weeded 6,702 mu of wheat seedlings, accounting for 60 percent of the total wheat land. Sixth, the seeds used by each cooperative were uniformly selected and retained by the cooperative last autumn, and stored centrally, and have all been dried and disinfected. Seventh, cooperatives near mountainous areas have developed forestry and animal husbandry. The Guo Yu'en cooperative planted and survived ten trees per person, and the agricultural production cooperative afforested 40 mu and cultivated a nursery of half a mu; the Dong Taoqi cooperative planted and survived 800 timber trees and 120 production trees, and specially transplanted 2,000 large-leaf poplar trees and afforested 10 mu. The sheep flocks and livestock of each cooperative have increased.
    In the production process of these five months, the agricultural production cooperatives implemented unified planning and collective management, further leveraging the potential power of land and labor. Some things that could not be done in the past have now been done in a very short time. The Guo Yu'en cooperative has a total of 130 mu of riveræ»©land that needs to be repaired and improved. In the past, each household operated separately, and everyone's thoughts were inconsistent, and this problem had not been solved for more than 30 years. In 1947, they had planned to improve it, but because three households did not agree, work could not start. This year, these households have all joined the agricultural production cooperative, and under the unified planning and management of the agricultural production cooperative, a large canal was repaired in five days. From then on, this 100+ mu of land can increase the production of fine grain by 30 shi per year.
    Second, in terms of organizational construction: First, improve leadership methods. After the autumn harvest last year, each cooperative conducted an appraisal and re-election of cadres. In the process of appraisal and re-election, democracy was generally promoted, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and models were also selected. Forty-seven cadres, headed by the head of the cooperative, were re-elected in the ten cooperatives, and twenty-four cadres (six deputy heads, three accountants, and fifteen team leaders) were not elected due to ineffective leadership and poor style. This strengthened the democratic life within the cooperative, improved the style of the cadres, and strengthened the leadership. From then on, the cadres and members united as one and worked hard to carry out production. This is one of the basic conditions for ensuring good production in 1952. Second, the division of labor and responsibility system within the cooperative is more sound than in 1951. The heads and deputy heads are divided into labor for production, political and cultural education, and sideline production, and so are each team leader. The accountant has a general accountant and a sub-accountant (the sub-accountant is the oil mill accountant, the flour mill accountant, etc.), and there are also professionals in charge of storage, technology, management of economic crops, management of small farms, and management of high-yield land. Third, the system has been further reviewed and approved. Some cooperatives have established a family representative meeting system, which can democratically discuss issues and reduce the number of meetings of cooperative members. The Guo Yu'en cooperative has stipulated a system of holding an "patriotic day" every half month, during which work is reviewed while enjoying collective entertainment. The Wang Chengxi cooperative has established a three-level accounting system for individuals, teams, and accountants, regularly checking accounts and settling accounts, so that it is clear. In short, various systems are gradually becoming rationalized.
    Third, in terms of political and cultural learning: All ten cooperatives have established a learning system; and it has been determined that the deputy head and deputy team leader are specifically responsible for leadership. The ten cooperatives have subscribed to a total of 40 copies of the Shanxi Daily, Shanxi Peasant Daily, Shanxi Pictorial, Youth Daily, and Women's Daily, averaging four copies per cooperative; and each cooperative has established a cooperative school as a place for collective learning. Ninety-two members of the ten cooperatives serve as propagandists, explaining current events to everyone at any time. In the past five months, 85 percent of the members have received 15 educations. Therefore, everyone's political enthusiasm is often full, and patriotic pacts have been generally revised. In terms of cultural learning, in the past five months, 192 people in the ten cooperatives have newly recognized 10 to 100 Chinese characters, and 316 people have recognized more than 100 Chinese characters. The young and middle-aged people in the Guo Yu'en cooperative can all learn to write simple letters and record work.
    Due to the continuous achievements in production and the strengthening of political and ideological education, the collectivist thinking of the members has been further improved. The public property and public accumulation funds of the ten cooperatives have increased greatly, including: the number of houses has increased from five to nine, the number of livestock has increased from 17 to 49 (four mules, four horses, nine donkeys, and 32 cattle), the amount of land has increased from 31.6 mu to 63.5 mu, and the number of agricultural implements has increased from 171 pieces (63 new-style agricultural implements) to 504 pieces (73 new-style agricultural implements). The public accumulation fund has increased by 4,132 jin of grain compared to last year. The flock of sheep has increased from 441 to 737. The number of pigs has increased from 41 to 50.
    In the past five months, agricultural production cooperatives have further demonstrated their superiority and have been more loved by the vast number of peasants. Therefore, all ten cooperatives have developed. The ten cooperatives originally had 190 member households, now increased to 246 households; the original number of people was 779, now increased to 965; the original number of livestock was 94, now increased to 113; the original amount of land was 1,400 mu, now increased to 2,637 mu.
    II. Three Major Experiences
    First, overcoming the complacency of cadres and members and solving problems in a timely manner is an important link in consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives. These ten cooperatives achieved great results in production in 1951, and when distributing production materials in the autumn, they were fair and reasonable, and the members were very satisfied. The masses outside the cooperative were very envious of the agricultural production cooperative, which laid the foundation for consolidating and developing the cooperative. At this time, some cadres in the county, district, village, and cooperative had a sense of pride and complacency, thinking that "there is no problem." Some counties withdrew cadres who were helping agricultural production cooperatives; some cooperatives were preparing to open the door wide and expand the members unconditionally; some cooperatives were content with the status quo and prepared to close the door and no longer develop. Under the influence of this complacency, some cadres and members of the cooperatives ignored many problems that urgently needed to be solved in the cooperative, which once affected the consolidation of the cooperative. The higher-level leading organs of each cooperative paid timely attention to these problems, strengthened leadership, pointed out the serious significance of consolidating the cooperative, emphasized overcoming complacency, and gained experience in consolidating the cooperative. Each cooperative began to attach importance to consolidation work. The Chen Erming cooperative suffered insect damage to cotton and suffered losses, and the members were emotionally turbulent. After the distribution of production fruits, some members were not completely settled down. The county and district cadres paid attention to this problem and led the cooperative to do a good job in winter production. As a result, not only did no household withdraw from the cooperative, but also 17 members were developed.
    Second, with the development of production, according to the needs of production and the requirements of members, gradually resolving the contradictions between unified management and individual ownership of means of production under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit is the key to raising the cooperative to a higher level. In 1951, most of these ten cooperatives hired livestock from members, and farm implements were also brought by the members themselves. In this way, many problems were constantly exposed in production. For example, livestock were only hired by the cooperative during the busy farming season, and the cooperative did not care about them during the slack season, which caused dissatisfaction among households with livestock. Farm implements were brought by the members themselves and shared by everyone. If they were broken, no one would repair them, and people with farm implements were very dissatisfied. Therefore, it has become everyone's common requirement for means of production to enter the cooperative with land and labor. This year, these ten cooperatives have begun to solve these problems. In terms of livestock, the following solutions have been adopted: one is to buy spot goods with cash to buy the members' livestock into the cooperative. Cooperatives with better economic conditions and sufficient funds have adopted this method. One is to apportion capital shares according to the mu of land and buy the members' livestock into the cooperative. Members who can pay immediately will pay immediately, and those who have difficulties will repay after the summer harvest, autumn harvest, or next year, and pay a small amount of interest. Individual cooperatives with very difficult economic conditions still use the method of private ownership and public employment, and prepare to change it after production is further improved. In terms of agricultural implements: This year, each cooperative has changed to large agricultural implements being valued and entering the cooperative, small agricultural implements are brought by themselves, and the cooperative repairs them if they are broken, and stipulates depreciation fees and sets up a special person to manage them. Fertilizers are mainly solved by planned powder factories to raise pigs, oil factories to earn bean cake, buying sheep manure, and collective composting. When fertilizers are insufficient, the cooperative purchases fertilizers from individual members. This practice is a step forward compared to last year's method of bringing fertilizers according to mu of land. In order to further solve the fertilizer problem within the cooperative, all the sheep flocks owned by the members of each cooperative are gradually transferred to the cooperative.
    Third, strengthening democratic management is an important method for consolidating agricultural production cooperatives. Last year, there were more or less undemocratic phenomena in the management of each cooperative. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the cadres of the cooperative stipulate systems and disciplines and hand them over to the members for implementation; the economic accounts are not made public or are not announced in a timely manner, and so on. There are also a few cooperatives that are contracted by district cadres. Therefore, some members believe that the cooperative is "the public's cooperative" and "the head of the cooperative's cooperative," which affects the members' enthusiasm for production. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the ten cooperatives conducted a democratic appraisal, democratic re-election, and model selection after the distribution of production products last autumn, and improved the leadership within the cooperative. At the same time, it also stipulated a system of re-election once a year and inspection once a quarter. Some unreasonable systems have been revised. This has strengthened the relationship between the cadres and members of the cooperative, enhanced the members' sense of responsibility to the cooperative, and the members' enthusiasm for production has been further increased. This is an important factor in the significant achievements in production of the ten cooperatives in the past five months.
