A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Review by the Construction Department of the Huizhou Special District on Neglecting the Quality of Spring Repair Projects

    To the Editor: In the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on May 13th, Wang Qifeng's letter pointed out that our special district has a tendency to focus on quantity and neglect quality in spring repair projects. We believe this criticism is correct. The occurrence of this bias is mainly due to the bureaucratic style of our work, and our failure to promptly conduct in-depth inspections of the construction of projects. The cadres responsible for technical guidance simply focused on completing tasks, neglecting the quality of the projects, resulting in some projects being destroyed by floods after heavy rains, or having water leakage, causing undue losses to people's property. In addition to urging the counties to conduct in-depth inspections and mobilize the masses to repair them, and educating water conservancy technical cadres to pay attention to project quality, we have also decided to organize a group of people to conduct focused inspections and acceptance in various counties. In the future, we will strengthen leadership, supervision, and inspection of water conservancy work to avoid the above-mentioned bias. Construction Department of the Huizhou Special District

### 徽州专署建设科对忽视春修工程质量的检讨

    徽州专署建设科对忽视春修工程质量的检讨
    编辑同志：五月十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了汪奇峰的来信，指出我专区在春修工程中有只顾数量不顾质量的偏向。我们认为这个批评是正确的。这一偏向的发生，主要是因为我们工作中有官僚主义作风，没有及时深入检查工程修建情况。负责技术指导的干部只是单纯为了完成任务，而忽视工程的质量，以致少数工程在大雨以后，被洪水冲毁，或有漏水现象，使人民财产遭到不应有的损失。我们除已督促各县深入检查，发动群众补修，并教育水利技术干部注意工程质量外，并决定组织一批人到各县有重点地检查验收。今后我们对水利工作要加强领导和督促检查，以避免发生上述偏向。    徽州专署建设科
