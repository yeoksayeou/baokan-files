    Soviet People and Korean People's Army Soldiers Continue to Protest U.S. Military Atrocities
    People from all over the Soviet Union continue to hold mass meetings
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: People from all over the Soviet Union continue to hold mass meetings to protest the atrocities of the American invaders in Korea. In their speeches and resolutions, the Soviet people unanimously demanded that the United States be stopped from committing crimes in Korea and from massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. At a meeting held at the Kuibyshev Ball Bearing Factory, factory doctor Lebedev said: "These days, no one has the right to remain silent. The American imperialists have used the most barbaric tools of mass human slaughter in Korea—bacteriological weapons. They have insulted Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and experimented on them with poisons and deadly bacteria. These atrocities have aroused extreme anger among the people of all countries!" Residents of many cities and villages in Ukraine and factories and groups in Kazakhstan have also held mass meetings. Collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have also held mass meetings. At a meeting held in the village of Armavir, Armenia, collective farm peasant Petrosyan said: "The American imperialists have violated the principles of international law and have turned Geoje Island into a torture chamber, where they are committing unprecedented atrocities against prisoners of war. I firmly believe that the fighters for peace and justice will be able to stop these crimes."
    "Pravda" published an editorial denouncing the crimes of the American invaders
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "The American Military Authorities are Following the Path of Hitler-Style Tyranny." The editorial said: "The American imperialists, who have embarked on the path of Hitler-style tyranny and bloody plunder, continue to commit heinous crimes in Korea. The American invaders believe that by taking barbaric actions against peace-loving people, they will be able to force the Korean people to submit. But the invaders' wicked gamble has backfired. They have underestimated the strength of the people's resistance. The Korean people have risen up to defend their homeland and wage a just war of liberation. With the fraternal assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people have waged a victorious resistance against the American invaders and their accomplices."
    "More and more news is coming out of Geoje Island about the inhumane abuse, torture, and slaughter of unarmed Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war. Geoje Island has been turned into a huge concentration camp, a death camp, by American secret agents." The editorial pointed out: "The heinous crimes of the American military have aroused the indignation and anger of hundreds of millions of people in all countries around the world. All progressive humanity condemns the American cannibals as irreconcilable enemies of the peace and freedom of all peoples."
    The editorial concluded: "The World Federation of Trade Unions, representing tens of millions of organized workers from all countries around the world, has called for the declaration of June 25, 1952 (the second anniversary of the American invaders' war of aggression against the Korean people) as Peace Day—an international day of solidarity with the heroic Korean people. On that day, the people of the world will be vigilant against the conspiracies of the instigators of imperialist war, once again express their hatred for the American invaders, express their fraternal sympathy for the brave and freedom-loving Korean people, and express their unwavering will and determination to fight for world peace."
    Protests from the People in the Front and Rear Areas of Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th] Meetings continue to be held in the front and rear areas of Korea, angrily protesting the bloody atrocities of the American invaders who continue to massacre our captured personnel.
    Xu Yongkuan, an officer of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army stationed on a high ground in Mundengli on the eastern front, said at a protest meeting: "The American murderers have not learned the lesson of their惨败惨败 and abandoned their ambition to enslave the Korean people. They are still deliberately delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, intensifying the torture and slaughter of our captured personnel, and attempting to forcibly detain them. We must further heighten our vigilance, strengthen our struggle against the enemy, and resolutely smash the enemy's conspiracy."
    The warriors of the Jin Guoshi detachment of a certain unit of the People's Army unanimously said: "All the enemy's threats, intimidation, and repression cannot weaken our captured personnel's firm will to be loyal to the motherland and the people, but can only further expose the enemy's hideous face before the people of the world. The enemy's conspiracy to detain our captured personnel will never be realized. The soldiers of the Korean People's Army will never tolerate the enemy's wanton persecution and slaughter of our captured personnel."
    At a meeting in the factory led by Jin Fengmou, model worker Han Changyu and female worker Park Chunyuk, among others, unanimously demanded that the American murderers be severely punished and that revenge be taken for our murdered captured personnel. Farmers in a suburb of Pyongyang held a protest meeting on the 12th, unanimously condemning the atrocities of the American invaders and resolutely expressing their determination to fight for the rescue of our captured personnel. Korean Cheondoist believers in the Pyongyang area held a meeting on the 11th to protest the atrocities of the American invaders who massacred our captured personnel. The meeting passed a protest letter, calling on all Korean Cheondoist believers to do their utmost to support the front line and rescue our captured personnel from the clutches of the enemy.

    苏联人民朝鲜军民继续抗议美军暴行
    苏联各地人民继续举行大会
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏联各地人民继续举行大会，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行。苏联人民在发言与决议中一致要求制止美国在朝鲜的罪行，并制止屠杀朝中战俘。在古比雪夫球轴承工厂举行的一次会议上，工厂医生列别捷夫说：这些天，任何人都没有权利保持沉默。美帝国主义者在朝鲜使用了最野蛮的大规模屠杀人类的工具——细菌武器。他们凌辱朝中战俘，并且在他们身上试验毒物和杀人的细菌。这些暴行使各国人民极端愤怒！乌克兰的许多城市与乡村的居民和哈萨克的工厂与团体都纷纷举行群众大会。苏联各地集体农场也纷纷举行大会。在亚美尼亚的亚玛维尔村举行的大会上，集体农场农民彼得罗斯扬说：美帝国主义者违反了国际法的原则，已经把巨济岛变成一个刑场，他们在那里对战俘们进行亘古未有的暴行。我坚决相信：和平与正义的战士们一定能够制止这些罪行。
    “真理报”发表社论指斥美国侵略者的罪行
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：苏联“真理报”十五日发表社论，题为“美国军事当局走上了希特勒式暴政的道路”。社论说：已经走上了希特勒式暴政的道路，走上了血腥掠夺的道路的美帝国主义者，继续在朝鲜犯下滔天罪行。美国侵略者认为他们对爱好和平的人民采取野蛮行动，就能够迫使朝鲜人民屈膝。但是侵略者的罪恶赌博的如意算盘打错了。他们低估了人民抵抗的力量。朝鲜人民奋起保卫祖国，进行正义的解放战争。在中国人民志愿军的兄弟般的援助下，朝鲜人民对美国侵略者及其帮凶军进行了胜利的抵抗。
    从巨济岛传出来愈来愈多的关于赤手空拳的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军被俘人员遭到不人道的虐待、酷刑与屠杀的消息，巨济岛已经被美国特务人员变成了一个巨大的集中营，变成一个死亡营了。社论指出：美国军方的滔天罪行，激起了全世界各国亿万人民的愤慨和激怒。所有进步人类都谴责美国吃人强盗是各国人民的和平与自由的不共戴天的死敌。
    社论最后说：世界工联代表世界各国几千万有组织的工人，号召宣布一九五二年六月二十五日（美国侵略者对朝鲜人民进行掠夺战争的第二周年）为保卫和平日——国际上声援英雄的朝鲜人民的日子。那一天，全世界人民将对帝国主义战争挑拨者的阴谋提高警惕，再一次表示对于美国侵略者的仇恨，表示他们对于勇敢的、爱好自由的朝鲜人民的兄弟般的同情，并表示他们为世界和平而战斗的不屈不挠的意志和决心。
    朝鲜前后方各地人民的抗议
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜前后方各地继续集会，愤怒地抗议美国侵略者不断屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行。
    坚守东线文登里某高地的朝鲜人民军某部军官徐永宽在抗议大会上说：美国杀人犯并没有接受惨败的教训而放弃其奴役朝鲜人民的野心，他们仍在蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判，变本加厉地拷问和屠杀我方被俘人员，企图加以强迫扣留。我们一定要进一步提高警惕，加强对敌斗争，有力地粉碎敌人的阴谋。
    人民军某部金国石区分队的勇士们一致说：敌人的一切威胁恫吓与镇压的手段，绝对不能削弱我方被俘人员效忠祖国与人民的坚决意志，而只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露敌人的狰狞面目。敌人扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋是决不会实现的。朝鲜人民军战士绝不能容忍敌人恣意迫害与屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行。
    在金凤谋所领导的工厂的集会上，模范工人韩昌玉与女工朴春玉等在发言中，一致要求严惩美国杀人犯，为被害的我方被俘人员报仇。平壤市郊某地农民在十二日举行抗议大会，一致声讨美国侵略者的暴行，并坚决表示要为救援我方被俘人员而奋斗。平壤地区的朝鲜天道教教徒在十一日举行大会，抗议美国侵略者屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行。大会通过了抗议书，号召朝鲜天道教全体教徒竭力支援前线，从敌人魔掌中救援我方被俘人员。
