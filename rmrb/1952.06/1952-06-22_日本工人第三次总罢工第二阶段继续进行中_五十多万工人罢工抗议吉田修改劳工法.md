Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st: According to TASS, Tokyo, June 21st: More than 500,000 workers employed by Japanese private railway companies, textile and mining enterprises, and Japanese seamen held a strike on the 20th to protest the Yoshida government's revision of the labor law. This strike is part of the second stage of the third general strike held by Japanese workers for this purpose. The heads of the splinter faction of the trade union organization vainly attempted to thwart or weaken this strike. However, despite the various activities of the splinter faction, Japanese workers once again demonstrated their firm will to fight against reactionary regulations.
    As a result of the seamen's strike, one hundred and seventy ships were unable to sail in Japanese ports. Dockworkers also expressed their support for the striking seamen and stopped loading and unloading work.
    According to the "Asahi Shimbun," municipal workers in Tokyo held a 30,000-person rally and demonstration, demanding the issuance of summer allowances.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st, Sofia: Dichev, Secretary-General of the International Union of Food, Tobacco and Hotel Workers, sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida on the 18th, protesting his bloody suppression of workers participating in the May Day parade and demanding the immediate release of all those arrested. The telegram stated: "The International Union of Food, Tobacco and Hotel Workers, representing five million members and employees, strongly protests the bloody suppression of the peaceful May Day demonstration and the intensification of the policy of terror against democratic fighters struggling for peace, freedom, and the independence of Japan. We firmly demand the immediate release of all those arrested and the guarantee of workers' rights and freedoms."
