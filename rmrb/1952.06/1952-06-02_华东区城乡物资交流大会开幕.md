The East China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference opened in Shanghai on May 25th. Participating in the conference were 297 representatives from public and private enterprises in provinces, cities, and special districts of the East China Region, along with 167 observing representatives and over 1,000 trade representatives. Delegations from major administrative regions across the country, as well as Inner Mongolia and Guangdong, have also arrived successively, preparing to participate in the conference and conduct transactions.

Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi delivered a report at the opening of the conference, pointing out that the convening of this year's East China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference is not only a preparation for the upcoming peak season of production and sales in the second half of the year but will also play a promoting role in the reorganization of the entire national economy and large-scale economic construction nationwide in the future. Precisely because its significance is so great, the strength of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives alone is not enough; private enterprises must also participate, and there must be government leadership.

Subsequently, he compared last year's Shanghai Native Produce Exhibition and Exchange Conference with this conference. He pointed out that, due to the convening of last year's Native Produce Exhibition and Exchange Conference, the sales channels for native produce were basically opened, paving the way for industrial products and making many people believe that there is indeed an infinitely broad future in the domestic market. However, after this situation was opened up, some industrialists and businessmen adopted capitalist practices in their business operations, knowing only profit and using any means, using the "five poisons" to harm the national economy. This shows why we carried out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and why we convened this exchange conference after the end of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Today, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have achieved great victories. The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" guarantees the future of China's economic construction; the convening of this urban-rural material exchange conference is to pave a broad road to industrialization for the national economy.

In order to make this East China Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Conference a success, Mayor Chen Yi reminded the representatives attending the meeting to pay attention to two situations. He said that the patriotic production increase movement is currently underway in rural areas, and farmers are eager to quickly sell their stored by-products in exchange for cash to buy various means of production; in the cities, some industrial products must be sold quickly in order to accelerate capital turnover and expand production. Therefore, he hoped that the representatives attending the conference could adopt a global perspective, do a good job in material exchange, and enable the conference to achieve great results. He hoped that after the "Three-Anti" movement, staff of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives could boldly and freely develop their businesses with a spirit of courage and responsibility; after the "Five-Anti" movement, private industrialists and businessmen should eliminate all concerns, actively participate in urban-rural exchange, and not adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Because as long as there are no "five poisons," the People's Government will encourage the development of all business operations that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Xu Xuehan, Chairman of the Conference Preparatory Committee, made a report on the tasks and policies of the conference. In his report, he criticized the capitalist business ideology and the agricultural socialist ideology of unilaterally taking care of the interests of farmers among some state-owned trade cadres and cooperative trade cadres.

He said that the central task of this conference is to "expand urban-rural material exchange, enliven the urban-rural economy, and support and guide industrial and agricultural production." In order to accomplish this task, the representatives of various public and private enterprises participating in the conference must "seek truth from facts, actively exchange, have both sales and purchases, and help each other for mutual benefit." He said that the business exchange policy of the conference is: for popular industrial products, transactions should be carried out in a planned manner based on production conditions; for commodities that are abundant in the off-season but not enough in the peak season, vigorous promotion should be carried out; for commodities that are oversupplied and of poor quality, sales can only be limited; for promising local and special products, efforts should be made to improve quality and expand sales; for temporarily unsalable but promising products, active assistance should be provided for promotion; for products with limited prospects, production can be maintained; as for products with small sales and no prospects, guidance should be given to reduce production or switch to other industries.

Finally, he proposed that the transaction method for this conference should be based on spot trading, supplemented by short-term futures. In terms of price policy, a policy of profitable buying and selling, small profits but quick turnover, taking care of the cost of industrial products, and taking care of the price difference of bulk native products should be adopted to achieve price guidance for production and consumption. He also pointed out that state-owned trade should closely rely on cooperatives, exert its leading role, actively unite private merchants, and jointly do a good job in urban-rural material exchange.

### 华东区城乡物资交流大会开幕

    华东区城乡物资交流大会开幕
    华东区城乡物资交流大会已于五月二十五日在上海开幕。参加大会的有华东区省、市和专区的公私企业代表二百九十七人，列席代表一百六十七人，贸易代表一千多人。全国各大行政区及内蒙、广东的代表团，也已先后到达，准备参加大会，进行交易。
    上海市市长陈毅在大会开幕时作了报告，指出：今年华东区城乡物资交流大会的召开，不仅是对今年下半年产销旺季的来临作好准备，而且对今后整个国民经济的改组和全国大规模的经济建设，将起推动作用。正因为它的意义如此重大，所以单是国营企业和合作社的力量就不够，必须还要有私营企业参加，也必须有政府的领导。
    接着，他把去年上海市土产展览交流大会和这次大会作了对比。指出：由于去年土产展览交流大会的召开，基本上打开了土产的销路，为工业品开辟了道路，使很多人相信了在国内市场上的确有无限广阔的前途。但是，当这个局面打开以后，却有部分工商业者在业务经营中，采取了只知利润不择手段的资本主义作法，用“五毒”来危害国民经济。由此可见我们为什么要进行“三反”、“五反”，又为什么在“三反”、“五反”运动结束以后，又召开这次交流大会。今天，“三反”、“五反”运动已经取得了伟大的胜利。有了“三反”、“五反”的胜利，才保证了中国经济建设的前途；这次城乡物资交流大会的召开，也就是要为国民经济铺平一条走上工业化的康庄大路。
    为了开好这次华东区城乡物资交流大会，陈毅市长提醒到会代表注意两个情况。他说：目前农村正在进行爱国丰产运动，农民迫切需要把自己所存的副产品赶快脱手，以换取现金来买进各种生产资料；在城市又有些工业品必须赶快卖出，以便加速资金周转，扩大生产。因此，他希望参加大会的代表能本全局观点，搞好物资交流工作，使大会获得很大成绩。他希望国营企业与合作社的工作人员在“三反”以后，能以勇于负责的精神，大胆放手开展业务；私营工商业者在“五反”以后，更要消除一切顾虑，积极参加城乡交流，不要采取观望应付的态度。因为只要没有“五毒”，人民政府对一切有利于国计民生的业务经营，是要鼓励其发展的。
    大会筹备委员会主任委员徐雪寒作了关于大会任务与方针的报告。他在报告中批判了当前某些国营贸易干部及合作贸易干部中的资本主义经营思想，和片面照顾农民利益的农业社会主义思想。
    他说，这次大会的中心任务，是“扩大城乡物资交流，活泼城乡经济，扶持和指导工、农业生产。”为了完成这一任务，参加大会的各公私企业代表，必须“实事求是积极交流，有卖有买，互助两利。”他说，大会的业务交流方针是：对畅销的工业品，应根据生产情况，进行有计划的交易；对于淡季有多，而旺季不够销的商品，应予大力推销；对于供过于求，规格又差的商品，只能限销；对于有前途的土特产品，要争取改善品质，扩大销路；对暂时滞销而有前途的，应积极协助推销；对前途不大的，可以维持生产；至于销路小而又无前途的，应指导其减产或转业。
    最后，他提出这次大会的交易方式，是以现货卖买为主，辅以短期期货。在价格政策方面，应当采取买卖有利，薄利多销，照顾工业品成本，照顾大宗土产差价的政策，做到价格指导生产指导消费。他并指出，国营贸易应紧密依靠合作社，发挥领导作用，积极团结私商，共同做好城乡物资交流工作。
