After the forum, the representatives also visited the village cooperative and interviewed emancipated farmers, model agricultural workers, and family members of military personnel.

Representatives from India, Burma, and Indonesia were warmly received by the Zhangguozhuang Village government.

The representatives then visited the homes of emancipated farmers, mutual aid production teams, the village's cultural center and primary school, and learned about spring plowing and drought prevention efforts. Several representatives happily participated in the elementary school students' group dances.

Representatives from the United States, Canada, and Japan spent the entire day visiting Yamenkou Village, accompanied by World Peace Council Secretary John Darr. The villagers introduced how their lives had improved since liberation. The representatives visited the school, clinic, cooperative, and farmers' homes.
