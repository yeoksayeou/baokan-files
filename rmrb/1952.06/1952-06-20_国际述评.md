The Solidarity of the People of Asia and the Pacific Region

The Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, held in Beijing from June 3rd to 6th, has achieved significant results under the warm support of hundreds of millions of people in the region and the joint efforts of the representatives of various countries attending the meeting. The achievements of the meeting demonstrated the unity of the people of various countries in the region under the profound desire for peace, and it laid a solid foundation for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing at the end of September this year.

The Preparatory Meeting unanimously adopted two important documents: the "Declaration of the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" and the "Proposal on Various Preparatory Work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." The meeting's declaration pointed out a path of unity and concerted efforts to strive for peace for the people of Asia and the Pacific region. The declaration called on the people of Asia and the Pacific region to "unite more widely and closely, act more resolutely and consistently, and more strongly undertake the noble cause of defending peace." The "Proposal on Various Preparatory Work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" suggested that this conference be held in Beijing in the last week of September this year, and set out the topics for discussion at the conference: 1. Safeguarding the independence, freedom, and peace of the people of Asia and the Pacific region, opposing the expansion of armaments and war preparations. Prohibiting war cries and propaganda of racial hatred; canceling all suppression of peace propaganda, and demanding freedom of the peace movement. Banning the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons; opposing the bombing and slaughter of non-combatants and peaceful residents, and strengthening the observance of international law. 2. Developing equitable and mutually beneficial legitimate international economic relations and cultural exchanges, opposing blockades and embargoes, improving people's lives, and enhancing the welfare of women and children. 3. Opposing the remilitarization of Japan and opposing the use of Japan as a base of aggression in order to eliminate the serious threat to peace in Asia and the Pacific region. 4. Peacefully resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis and reasonably resolve all peace-related issues in Asia and the Pacific region (including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya, etc.). The success of the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference fully demonstrated the firm will of the people of various countries in the region to unite and strive for peace.

The Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed in Beijing on June 1st is a good start for the development of economic relations between Asian countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and it is completely in line with the tasks put forward in the Declaration of the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The signing of this trade agreement, with a total import and export value of 60 million pounds, will play a significant role in improving the current economic situation in Japan and the living conditions of the Japanese people. According to Takara Tomi, the Japanese representative who attended the International Economic Conference and the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and one of the signatories to the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement may provide employment for three million unemployed workers in Japan, and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises will also be prevented from going bankrupt and closing down. It can be seen from this that the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, as Suzuki, the Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, said, has at least pointed out a bright future for Sino-Japanese trade, which has been stagnant until today.

Cannot Tolerate the U.S. Atrocities of Slaughtering Prisoners of War

Regardless of the world's people's angry protests against their endless atrocities of slaughtering prisoners of war, the U.S. aggressors carried out an unprecedented bloody massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island on the 10th of this month. This is the most serious of the recent atrocities by the U.S. side in slaughtering our captured personnel. According to reports from U.S. news agencies, more than 1,000 U.S. soldiers, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, "fired 1,000 flamethrower rounds, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades" and launched a disgraceful attack on our defenseless captured personnel. Executioner Boatner admitted that the known number of our captured personnel who were killed and wounded has reached as many as 170, and other corpses "are still being searched for." This bloody fact thoroughly exposed the bloody inside story of the U.S. aggressors' so-called "humanitarian principles" and "voluntary repatriation" schemes in front of the people of the world.

While the U.S. side was preparing and carrying out bloody massacres of our captured personnel, the U.S. negotiating representatives at the armistice talks repeatedly unilaterally announced a three-day adjournment on June 7th and 17th, and refused to attend the meeting, carrying out brutal destruction of the armistice talks. This is an intolerable provocation by the U.S. side against us. For this reason, General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent a stern warning to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the "United Nations Forces," in a letter on June 9th, saying: If the U.S. side intends to break off the negotiations by this, then the U.S. side should publicly announce it and bear the responsibility. If the U.S. side deliberately wants to create tension in the Far East situation due to ulterior motives, the result will inevitably arouse the anger and condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world. Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young also sent a letter to the United Nations Secretariat on June 15th, protesting the bloody atrocities of the U.S. aggressive army in slaughtering our captured personnel, demanding that the United Nations immediately take measures to stop this atrocity, and impose severe international sanctions on war criminals. It is clear that if the U.S. side does not stop the bloody massacres of our captured personnel, if the U.S. side does not abandon its unreasonable plan soaked in the blood of prisoners of war and accept our reasonable compromise plan, then the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the failure of the negotiation meeting to proceed normally, and they must be subjected to the just sanctions of peace-loving people all over the world.

Support the Anti-Fascist Struggle of the French and Japanese People

The tide of protests by the French people against the fascist atrocities of the Bineau reactionary government in arresting Duclos and suppressing the patriotic movement is rising. In these days, the French people, united around the French Communist Party, continue to launch a heroic counterattack against the brutal attacks of the Bineau reactionary government. The working people of France responded to the call of the French General Confederation of Labor and launched a large-scale demonstration strike starting on June 4th, regardless of the barbaric suppression of the Bineau reactionary government. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and many other French cities participated in this struggle. During the strike on June 4th, the police arrested 150 trade union activists. However, the brutal suppression cannot stop the strike movement, but instead makes the scale of the strike movement even larger. Currently, this strike struggle has spread throughout the country and to various industries. This fully demonstrates the strong will of the French working people to struggle.

The movement to demand the release of Duclos and support the heroic struggle of the French people has become a mass movement in various countries around the world. Our people express infinite anger at the atrocities of the French rulers. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, our democratic parties, and people's organizations unanimously protested the atrocities of the Bineau government in arresting Duclos and expressed warm support for the heroic struggle of the French people. People in Beijing and other places have held protest rallies. The people of the Eastern European people's democratic countries, the people of Western European countries, the people of Asian countries such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and Indonesia, as well as the people of North Africa, the United States, and Australia, have all enthusiastically launched protest movements. The increasingly激昂 protests of people all over the world have encouraged the just struggle of the French people.

At the same time as the French reactionary government arrested Duclos, the Japanese Yoshida reactionary government is continuing to frantically suppress the patriotic movement of the Japanese people. Under the instructions of the U.S. occupiers, the Yoshida reactionary government created a new bloody incident on May 30th, carrying out large-scale arrests and massacres of patriotic people who held demonstrations and parades throughout Japan. However, the Yoshida reactionary government's frantic suppression did not stop the expansion of the Japanese people's struggle for independence and democracy. On June 7th, Japanese workers began the first stage of the third general strike, with 700,000 members of eighteen national trade unions in Japan participating in the strike movement, together with workers participating in other various protest movements, totaling 3 million people. The second stage of the strike was held on June 17th, with 800,000 workers participating in the general strike, and more than 2 million workers and students holding protest rallies and demonstrating in support of the striking workers. This once again showed the Japanese working people's firm will to oppose the fascist bills of the Yoshida reactionary government.

The atrocities of the French Bineau government in arresting Duclos and suppressing the patriotic movement of the French people, and the atrocities of the Japanese Yoshida government in massacring Japanese demonstrators on May 30th, are all steps taken by U.S. imperialism to frantically promote its aggressive policies in Europe and Asia. The French and Japanese people firmly oppose the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism and are determined to block the path of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in France and Japan from leading their countries to fascism and war. The struggle of the people of France and Japan for peace, independence, and democracy has clearly given a serious blow to the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism.

The Victory of Peace, the Victory of Communism

The Volga-Don Canal, the first communist construction project built by the Soviet people according to the great Stalin plan, has been completed, and the waters of the Volga and Don rivers met on May 31st. This is a new achievement of the Soviet people in peaceful construction, and a major victory for the Soviet people in realizing the common ideal of mankind—communist society.

The Volga-Don Canal was successfully built under the infinite development of the productive forces of Soviet socialist society, the close combination of creative labor and advanced science and technology. The canal is 101 kilometers long and includes huge projects such as 13 locks, 3 dams, and 4 large reservoirs. This great canal was completed in only four years, and its construction speed far exceeded the construction speed of canals in various countries in history. This fact is a powerful illustration of the unparalleled superiority of socialist society.

The opening of this great canal connecting the five seas of the Soviet Union will have a significant impact on the development of the Soviet national economy. It will simultaneously solve the three main tasks of transportation, irrigation, and power supply in the Soviet national economy. The Volga-Don Canal connects the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea into a single waterway system, which will strengthen waterway transportation and material exchanges in the Soviet interior and create conditions for further development of the economy of various regions of the Soviet Union. The huge irrigation network will provide a large amount of water to the vast land of Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast; this water is enough to irrigate 750,000 hectares of land and divert water to 2 million hectares of land. The powerful 160,000 kilowatt current from the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station will further electrify agriculture in Rostov Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast. In addition, the Volga-Don Canal construction project also solved another important task: it is a testing ground for new large-scale technologies in the Soviet Union. The valuable experience accumulated by the construction workers of this great canal will be used in various other constructions in the Soviet Union. The opening of the Volga-Don Canal will bring a richer life to the Soviet people, lead the Soviet economy to further development and prosperity, and provide a great inspiration to the struggle of the people of the world for peace and a better life.

    国际述评
    亚洲及太平洋区域人民的团结
    六月三日至六日在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，在这一区域亿万人民的热烈支持与参加会议的各国代表的共同努力下，已获得重大的成就。会议的成就，表现了这一区域各国人民在要求和平的深切愿望下的团结，它给将在今年九月底在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议奠定了稳固的基础。
    筹备会议一致通过了“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言”和“关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项筹备工作的提议”两项重要的文件。会议宣言给亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民指出一条团结一致争取和平的道路，宣言号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民“更广泛地紧密团结，更坚决地一致行动，更坚强地把保卫和平的崇高事业担当起来”。“关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项筹备工作的提议”建议这一会议于今年九月的最后一个星期在北京举行，并订出大会讨论题目：一、保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平，反对扩军备战。禁止关于战争的叫嚣及种族仇恨的宣传；取消一切对和平宣传的压制，要求和平运动的自由。禁止使用原子、细菌及化学武器；反对对于非战斗人员及和平居民的轰炸与屠杀，加强对于国际法的遵守。二、发展平等互利的正当国际经济关系与文化交流，反对封锁和禁运，改善人民生活，增进妇女儿童的福利。三、反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁。四、在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题并合理地解决亚洲及太平洋区域（包括越南、寮国、柬埔寨、马来亚等地在内）一切有关和平的问题。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的成功，充分表现了这一区域各国人民团结起来争取和平的坚决意志。
    六月一日在北京签订的中日贸易协议，是亚洲各国人民之间在平等互利的基础上发展经济关系的良好开端，它是完全符合亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言所提出的任务的。这个进出口总额共值六千万英镑的贸易协议的签订，对于改善目前日本经济情况和日本人民生活情况将起着重大的作用。据日本出席国际经济会议和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议代表、中日贸易协议签订人之一高良富估计：中日贸易协议的实现，可能使日本三百万失业工人得到职业，大批的中小企业也将因此不致于破产和倒闭。由此可见，中日贸易协议的签订，正如日本中日贸易促进会理事长铃木所说：至少给直到今天毫无起色的中日贸易指出了光明的前途。
    不能容忍美方屠杀战俘的罪行
    美国侵略者不顾全世界人民对他们层出不穷的屠杀战俘的罪行的愤怒抗议，竟于本月十日对巨济岛上我方被俘人员进行了一次空前的血腥屠杀。这是最近美方屠杀我方被俘人员暴行中的最严重的一次。据美方通讯社的透露：一千多名美国士兵在坦克和装甲车的掩护下，“发射了一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹”，对赤手空拳的我方被俘人员进行了可耻的进攻。刽子手波纳承认：已知的被打死打伤的我方被俘人员已达一百七十名之多，其他尸体“仍在继续寻找中”。这血腥的事实在全世界人民面前彻底地揭露了美国侵略者所谓“人道原则”、“自愿遣返”等阴谋的血腥内幕。
    与美方准备并进行对我方被俘人员血腥屠杀的同时，美方谈判代表在停战谈判会议中竟于六月七日和十七日一再片面宣布休会三天，拒绝到会，对停战谈判进行横暴的破坏。这是美方对我方的令人不能容忍的挑衅。为此，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军于六月九日给“联合国军”总司令克拉克的信中提出严正的警告说：如果美方意欲借此破裂谈判，那美方就应公开宣布，承担责任。如果美方因有不可告人的隐衷而欲故意造成远东局势的紧张，则所得结果必将引起全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒和责难。朝鲜外务相朴宪永也于六月十五日致函联合国秘书处，抗议美国侵略军屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行，要求联合国立即采取措施，制止这种暴行，并予战争罪犯以严厉的国际制裁。很明显，如果美方不停止对我方被俘人员的血腥屠杀，如果美方不放弃其浸透战俘鲜血的无理方案并接受我方的合理折衷方案，那末，美方对于谈判会议不能正常进行就必须负完全的责任，他们就一定要受到全世界爱好和平人民的正义的制裁。
    支持法国、日本人民反法西斯斗争
    法国人民对比内反动政府逮捕杜克洛、镇压爱国运动的法西斯暴行的抗议浪潮正在高涨中。这些天法国人民团结在法国共产党的周围，对比内反动政府的残暴进攻继续展开英勇的还击。法国各地劳动人民响应法国总工会的号召，不顾比内反动政府的野蛮镇压，于六月四日开始举行了大规模的示威罢工。巴黎、里昂、马赛以及其他许多法国城市的几十万工人都参加这一斗争。在六月四日的罢工中，警察逮捕了工会活动分子一百五十人。然而蛮横的镇压决不能阻止住罢工运动，反而使罢工运动的规模更加扩大。目前这一罢工斗争已遍及全国各地各行业。这充分表明了法国劳动人民的坚强斗争的意志。
    要求释放杜克洛，声援法国人民的英勇斗争的运动，已成为世界各国的群众运动。我国人民对法国统治者的暴行表示无限的愤怒。中国共产党中央委员会、我国各民主党派和各人民团体一致抗议比内政府逮捕杜克洛的暴行，并对法国人民的英勇斗争表示热烈的支持。北京和各地人民都纷纷举行了抗议集会。东欧人民民主国家的人民，西欧各国的人民，亚洲的朝鲜、越南、日本、印尼等国的人民以及北非、美国和澳大利亚的人民都热烈地展开了抗议运动。全世界各国人民日益激昂的抗议，鼓舞了法国人民的正义斗争。
    与法国反动政府逮捕杜克洛的同时，日本吉田反动政府正继续疯狂地镇压日本人民的爱国运动。吉田反动政府在美国占领者的指使下，又于五月三十日制造了新的血腥事件，对日本全国各地举行示威游行的爱国人民进行了大规模的逮捕和屠杀。然而吉田反动政府的疯狂镇压并没有阻止住日本人民争取独立和民主的斗争的扩展。六月七日，日本工人又开始了第三次总罢工的第一阶段的罢工，日本的十八个全国性工会的七十万会员都参加了这次的罢工运动，连同参加其他各种抗议运动的工人计算在一起共计有三百万人。第二阶段的罢工已于六月十七日举行，参加总罢工的工人达八十万人，而举行抗议集会并示威的声援罢工工人的工人和学生达二百多万人。这再一次显示了日本劳动人民反对吉田反动政府的法西斯法案的坚定的意志。
    法国比内政府逮捕杜克洛、镇压法国人民爱国运动的暴行和日本吉田政府五月三十日屠杀日本示威群众的暴行，都是美帝国主义在欧洲和亚洲疯狂推行其侵略政策的步骤。法国人民和日本人民坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策，坚决要堵住美帝国主义及其在法国和日本的走狗将他们的国家导向法西斯和战争的道路。法国和日本两国人民争取和平、争取独立和民主的斗争，显然已经给了美帝国主义的侵略政策以严重的打击。
    和平的胜利，共产主义的胜利
    苏联人民根据伟大的斯大林计划兴修的第一个共产主义建设工程伏尔加—顿运河已经完工，伏尔加河和顿河的河水已于五月三十一日会合了。这是苏联人民进行和平建设的新成就，这是苏联人民实现人类的共同理想——共产主义社会的重大胜利。
    伏尔加—顿运河是在苏联社会主义社会生产力无限发展、创造性劳动和高度科学技术的密切结合之下建设成功的。运河长达一百零一公里，包括十三道水闸、三道堤坝、四个大水库等巨大工程。这条大运河总共只用四年的时间就建筑完成了，它的建筑速度远远超过历史上各国运河的建筑速度。这一事实就是社会主义社会具有无比的优越性的有力的例证。
    这个联接苏联五大海的大运河的通航，对苏联国民经济的发展将发生重大的作用。它将同时解决运输、灌溉和电力供应等苏联国民经济中的三个主要任务。伏尔加—顿运河把白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海和黑海联接起来，成为一个单一的水道系统，将加强苏联内地的水路运输和物资交流，为进一步发展苏联各地区的经济创造了条件。巨大的灌溉网将使罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州的广大土地获得大量的水分；这些水足以灌溉七十五万公顷土地并引水到二百万公顷的土地上。从齐姆良水力发电站发出的十六万瓩的强大电流，将使罗斯多夫州和斯大林格勒州的农业进一步电气化。除此之外，伏尔加—顿运河建设工程还解决了另外一个重要的任务：它是苏联新的大规模技术的实验场，这条大运河的建设工作者所积累的宝贵经验，将被用到苏联的其他各种建设上去。伏尔加—顿运河的通航，将给苏联人民带来更加丰足的生活，使苏联经济走向更进一步的发展和繁荣，也给予世界人民为争取和平和美好的生活的斗争以巨大的鼓舞。
