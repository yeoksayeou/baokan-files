    How a Group in the No. 2 Machinery Factory Formulated a Production Increase and Savings Plan
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Yang Luolin
    What is introduced here is the process by which the No. 2 Team of the No. 1 Workshop of the No. 1 Engineering Section of the No. 2 Machinery Factory of the Northeast Industrial Department Machinery Industry Administration formulated a production increase and savings plan.
    The No. 2 Team of lathe operators is the key team in the entire workshop. All the machine tools used in the team are heavy-duty, and the products processed are mostly large parts. The team has fifty-six workers, of which only sixteen are technicians, and the rest are helpers and apprentices. This team was an advanced team in last year's production increase and savings campaign, and won the red flag in this year's production competition to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day.
    In May, the team discussed the production increase and savings plan. All the workers in the team demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, finding tricks, tapping potential, changing labor organization, and formulating an advanced production increase and savings plan. This plan requires the entire team to overfulfill the production task by 165% in May, increasing production and saving the country wealth equivalent to 306 tons and 420 kilograms of grain.
    How did they formulate the production increase and savings plan?
    Break the conservative idea of "all tricks have been exhausted" and learn from advanced experience
    The factory leadership has long made it clear that the process of formulating a production increase and savings plan is a process of relying on the masses, finding tricks, tapping potential, and learning from advanced experience. After the No. 2 Team won the red flag in the competition in April, it discussed the production increase and savings plan within the team. At that time, some workers believed that after last year's production increase and savings competition and this year's trick-finding campaign in April, all the tricks had been exhausted. "Tricks have been found three or four times, and working hours have been shortened several times. Only a master craftsman can find more." Obviously, overcoming this idea of "all tricks have been exhausted" is very necessary. At the propaganda staff meeting, the general branch committee member of the Party said: "Production is developing forward day by day, and technology is improving day by day. Unreasonable equipment and outdated operating methods will be exposed more and more obviously. There are many tricks, and the problem lies in everyone using their brains to think of ways." After propaganda and education, the workers' thinking began to open up. Liu Qichang improved the method of using a tool post to turn pistons. What originally required three cuts can now be done with one cut. Han Jiancong used to rely on increasing labor intensity to increase production. He once said, "Watch out, this time the campaign will have to sell a little more effort, and overtime is no problem." The team leader pointed out his shortcomings and inspired him to use his brain, find tricks, and use improved technology to increase production. With everyone's help, Han Jiancong learned from the experience of the Fifth Workshop and used the auxiliary tool post to implement a multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, shortening working hours by a quarter. All the workers in the team attached importance to finding tricks, tapping potential, and learning from advanced experience, which laid a favorable foundation for formulating a production increase and savings plan.
    Convene a meeting of activists to study key issues in production
    Before the production increase and savings tasks were determined, the team convened a meeting of activists to study key issues in improving production. The main problem currently existing in the team is that there are too many non-standard products. In March, the team implemented a high-speed cutting method to process flange plates and piston bores. The processed materials shrink when cooled and expand when heated. Some finished products meet the specifications on the lathe, but shrink by a dozen or so lines after cooling. Therefore, twelve products were non-standard in March. In April, they began to reserve the size of the expansion coefficient according to the increase in the temperature of the processed material, which solved part of the problem. However, because the hardness of the materials is different, the degree of shrinkage is still inconsistent, and the quality of some finished products is very hard, and the shrinkage rate is very small, so they are still non-standard. After everyone's research, according to the quality of the material, different expansion dimensions can be reserved, so that the quality can be completely guaranteed. Because the key problems in production have been solved, everyone's confidence has been increased, and the advanced production increase and savings plan that has been formulated can be realized.

    机械二厂的一个小组是怎样制订增产节约计划的
    本报特约记者  杨洛林
    这里介绍的，是东北工业部机械工业管理局机械二厂一车间一工段车工二组制订增产节约计划的经过。
    车工二组是全车间的关键小组，组内所用的全是重型机床，加工产品多是大型部件。全组有五十六个工人，其中只有十六个技工，其余的都是帮工和徒工。这个组在去年增产节约运动中，是一个先进小组，在今年四月迎接“五一”劳动节的生产竞赛中，又获得了红旗。
    五月，小组讨论增产节约计划。全组工人发挥了高度的爱国主义热情，找窍门，挖潜力，改变劳动组织，订出一个先进的增产节约计划。这个计划要求全组在五月份超额完成生产任务的百分之一百六十五，给国家增产节约三百零六吨四百二十公斤粮食的财富。
    他们是怎样订立增产节约计划的呢？
    打破“窍门绝了”的保守思想，学习先进经验
    该厂领导方面早已明确指出，订增产节约计划的过程，就是依靠群众，找窍门，挖潜力，学习先进经验的过程。二组在四月份得到竞赛的优胜红旗后，就在组内讨论增产节约计划。那时候，有的工人认为经过去年的增产节约竞赛运动和今年四月的找窍门运动，窍门已经绝了。“窍门已经找过三四次啦，工时缩短了好几倍，除了神手谁也找不到了。”非常显然，克服这种“窍门绝了”的思想是十分必要的。在宣传员会议上，党的总支委员说：“生产一天一天向前发展，技术一天一天提高，不合理的设备和陈旧的操作方法也会一天比一天更加明显地暴露出来了。窍门多得很，问题在于大家动脑筋想办法。”经过宣传教育，工人思想开始打通了。刘其昌改进了刀杆车活塞的方法，原来需要三刀的活，现在用一刀就行了。韩见聪过去是依靠加强劳动强度来增产的，他曾说：“瞧着吧，这次运动更得卖点力气，加班加点没关系。”组长指出他的缺点，启发他动脑筋，找窍门，用改进技术的方法来增加产量。在大家的帮助下，韩见聪学习了第五车间的经验，利用副刀架子实行多刀多刃切削法，缩短了工时四分之一。全组工人重视了找窍门、挖潜力和学习先进经验，给订增产节约计划打下了有利的基础。
    召开积极分子会议，研究生产中的关键问题
    在增产节约任务还没有确定以前，组内就召开了积极分子会议，研究提高生产的关键问题。该组现存的主要问题是不合规格的产品太多。三月份该组实行高速切削法，加工法蓝盘和活塞洞。加工物是冷缩热胀的，有些成品在车床上合乎规格，但冷却以后，就缩小了十几道。因此，三月份有十二件产品不合规格。在四月份，他们开始按照加工物热度增高的情形，留出膨胀系数的尺寸，解决了部分问题。但因材料的软硬程度不同，收缩的程度还不一致，有些成品的质量很硬，收缩数率很小，还是不合规格。经过大家研究，根据材料的质量，留出不同的膨胀尺寸，这样，就可以彻底地保证质量了。因为解决了生产中的关键问题，大家的信心提高了，订出的先进的增产节约计划，也就可能实现了。
