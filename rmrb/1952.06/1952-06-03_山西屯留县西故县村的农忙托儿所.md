The farm-busy nursery of Xiguxian Village, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, was established in the spring of 1951. At that time, the village was carrying out a patriotic production increase campaign. In order to smoothly complete the spring plowing production plan, Yang Xicheng's mutual aid group mobilized women to go to the fields to participate in production, but many women were burdened by their children and unable to go to the fields. Later, Yang Xicheng proposed the method of collectively looking after the children, saying, "Last year, Wang Guoxian, a 65-year-old woman in our group, looked after her three nephews alone, allowing her two daughters to go to the fields to work. Isn't this a good method?" This reminded everyone. Zhao Heizi continued, "This method is good, but it depends on whether someone will take care of the children." Yang Xicheng said, "I will go back and mobilize my wife to take care of the children for everyone." Zhou Shuangxi continued, "My 66-year-old mother has been taking care of children for most of her life and is full of experience; the women also trust her, and I guarantee to mobilize her to take care of the children for everyone." The problem was thus solved. Yang Youxian, Wang Guoxian, and Song Yinmiao, three old women, took care of twelve children from seven families, freeing up the young mothers of the twelve children to go to the fields to work. Yang Xicheng's mutual aid group's farm-busy nursery was thus organized.

At first, the women were always worried about leaving their children in the care of others. They were afraid that others would not care enough for their children, that the children would cry when separated from their mothers, that the children would go hungry, that they would fight with older children, that they would fall, and that the children would get sick from eating hot milk after returning from the fields. They were afraid of this and that, and always felt that it was better to take care of them themselves. Therefore, in the first few days, some mothers would secretly listen outside the door when they returned from working in the fields to see if the children were crying and how the old women were taking care of them. Later, everyone saw with their own eyes that the old women cared for the children very much. They not only washed diapers for the children, but also used their own rice and flour to cook soup and mix noodle soup for the children. The children were all happily playing together. In this way, the mothers were completely relieved. Many women said, "The old women are more concerned about the children than we are, just like our own mothers."

The food for the children was prepared by each family; the older children were given rice soup mixed with noodle soup in the late morning, and the rice and flour were shared by each family. The toys of each family were gathered together so that the children could play together. The children were not allowed to eat things indiscriminately or eat raw and cold food. When the women returned from the fields to breastfeed their children, they first squeezed out the hot milk from the nipples, kneaded the milk, rested for a while, and then let the children eat, so that the children remained healthy. The nannies who looked after the children were appropriately credited with work points.

The prefectural commissioner's office and county leadership sent cadres to help and guide the farm-busy nursery in order to make it better.

First, the system for taking care of children and the sanitation of the nursery were strengthened. To avoid accidents, toilets and well openings were all covered, and the yard was swept once a day to keep the nursery clean. The nannies washed the children's hands and faces once a day; for very young children, diapers were washed once a day. The village health center's doctor was invited to examine the children's bodies once every ten days, and if any infectious diseases were found, they were immediately isolated and treated. The situation of the children was explained when they entered and left the nursery, indicating whether the children had any diseases.

Second, equal value and mutual benefit were achieved. The method was: points were calculated according to the age of the child. Children under two years old were credited with 2.5 points per day, children under four years old were credited with 2 points, and children between four and six years old were credited with 1 point. Once 10 points were reached, it was equivalent to a full female laborer, and remuneration was given according to the wage standard assessed during the busy farming season, either by paying wages, exchanging labor in the fields, or helping with pushing the millstone and sewing clothes.

Third, political and ideological education for the nannies was strengthened. In addition to participating in the newspaper reading group on time to listen to the reading of newspapers, a special person went to the nursery every five days to explain political current affairs issues, and the nannies were mobilized to sign patriotic pledges, including the clause "taking care of children with care" in the patriotic pledges. At the same time, doctors regularly explained health knowledge to the nannies.

In this way, the nursery was further consolidated and improved.

After the establishment of the nursery, the number of women working in the fields gradually increased. Liu Jinyuan's wife, a farmer, was unable to do any work in the past because she was burdened by three children. Now she sends all her children to the nursery and weeds wheat with other women. This year, a total of ten nursery groups have been developed in the village, with 35 nannies taking care of 125 children, freeing up 98 women to participate in agricultural production. In the work of fighting drought and spring plowing and sowing, women cooperated with men to dig 25 wells, build 4 water storage ponds, and pick up grain stubble in 970 mu of fields. Most of the village's 1,700 mu of wheat fields were also weeded by women. Due to the participation of a large number of women in agricultural production, "land processing" was done better, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest in 1952. The social status of women has also been improved. Many men said, "Now women are of great use." In addition, old women who have no labor at home also have the opportunity to exert their strength. For example, Wang Guoxian, an old woman in her sixties, has failing eyesight and cannot do much work, but she is very capable as a nanny in the nursery. She takes care of six children alone and has earned a total of 1,500 points from last spring to this spring, equivalent to 150 workdays. At 3 sheng of rice per workday, she can earn 4 shi and 5 dou of rice. She happily grinned and said, "Who would have thought that an old blind woman like me would also be of great use."

Secondly, the relationship between farmers has become more harmonious, and neighborhood relations have also improved. For example, the children of Ma Wu'er and Zhang Guisheng used to fight with each other, causing discord between the parents. Now that the children of both families are sent to the nursery, there are no more fights. Many women see how the nannies care for their children and automatically help them make shoes, sew clothes, and comb their hair, as if they were one family. The nannies stroked the young mothers of the children and said, "You are all like my own daughters."

The children have also developed the habit of living in a collective. Women with children all say, "Now, if you ask a child to stay at home alone, he will cry, but if they stay together, they will be so happy that they jump up and down and don't even want to eat." Therefore, mothers often bring their children together to do needlework.

Xiguxian Village has such a folk song: "The nursery is really good, it has three advantages, first, the nannies take good care of the children, and the children grow up healthy; second, the biological mothers are relieved and go to the fields to engage in production together; third, it cultivates the next generation and contributes to society." The masses in nearby villages also praised Xiguxian Village, saying that the crops grow well, the children eat well, there are few idlers in the village, and the streets and courtyards are often swept.

The success of the farm-busy nursery in Xiguxian Village has been rewarded by the Changzhi Prefectural Health Section, the Prefectural Women's Federation, the Tunliu County People's Government, and the County Democratic Women's Federation. In order to promote this experience, a demonstration meeting was organized for more than 400 people from 15 nearby villages, using real people and real events to illustrate the superiority of the farm-busy nursery. Zhao Changhua, a woman from Xiqu Village, said after watching the nursery, "This method is really good. I wanted to join the mutual aid group in the spring, but the children were too tired to let me go. This time I have to set up a nursery when I go back." Wang Guinu, a woman from Lijia Gou, said, "If I had known this method earlier and set up a nursery, my seedlings would not have been barren. It was because the children were so tired that we couldn't go to the fields and couldn't find busy work, so the land was barren. When we go back, we have to learn from Xiguxian." After the demonstration, more than 20 villages in the county have organized farm-busy nurseries. Farmers in Xiangyuan, Licheng, Changzhi, Huguan, Wuxiang and other places have also organized farm-busy nurseries.

    山西屯留县西故县村的农忙托儿所
    申鲁明　杨千  耕溪　杨迁
    山西省屯留县西故县村的农忙托儿所是在一九五
    一年春天建立起来的。当时该村正在开展爱国丰产竞赛运动，杨喜成互助组为要顺利完成春耕生产计划，曾发动妇女下地参加生产，但是许多妇女被孩子拖累着，下不了地。后来杨喜成提出了伙看孩子的办法，他说：“去年咱组里六十五岁的王果仙老婆，一个人看管她的三个外甥，让她的两个闺女下地做活，这个办法不很好吗？”这就提醒了大家。赵黑子接着说：“这办法是好的，就看是不是有人来照顾孩子了。”杨喜成说：“我先回去动员我的老婆来给大家看。”周双喜接着说：“我六十六岁的老娘，半辈子都是照料孩子，满有经验；妇女们也相信她，我保证动员她给大家看孩子。”问题便这样解决了。由杨有仙、王果仙、宋银苗三个老太太看管了七个家庭的十二个孩子，腾出了十二个孩子的青年母亲们下地做活。杨喜成互助组的农忙托儿所就这样地组织起来了。
    妇女们一开始把孩子交给别人看管，总是放心不下。她们怕别人对自己的孩子关心不够，怕孩子离开了母亲要啼哭，怕孩子饿肚子，怕他们和大孩子打架，怕孩子们跌交，怕下地回来孩子们吃上热奶要生病。她们怕这怕那，总觉得不如自己看管好。因此在开头几天，有的母亲下地做活回来时，总要先悄悄在门外听一听动静，看看孩子哭没有哭，看看老人们照管得怎样。后来大家亲眼看到老太太们对孩子们非常关心，她们不但给孩子们洗屎布，还拿自己的米面给孩子们熬汤、拌面汤。孩子们都高高兴兴地在一块玩耍。这样，母亲们才完全放了心。许多妇女说：“老人们看孩子比咱还操心呢，真和自己的亲娘一样。”
    小孩吃的东西由各家准备；大一点的孩儿在半前晌给熬米汤拌面汤喝，米面由各家公摊。各家的小儿玩具集中起来，让孩子们在一块儿玩。不让小孩乱吃东西或吃生冷食物。妇女们下地回来给孩子喂奶时，都先挤去奶头上的热奶，把奶揉一揉，歇一阵再让孩子吃，使孩子们保持了健康。对看孩子的褓姆，适当地给记分顶工。
    专署和县领导方面为了使这个农忙托儿所办得更好，派干部去帮助和指导它。
    首先是加强看管小孩的制度和托儿所的卫生工作。为避免发生意外的事情，厕所、井口一律上盖，每天扫一次院子，经常保持托儿所内的清洁。褓姆每天给小孩洗手洗脸一次；给很小的孩子，每天洗屎布一次。每十天请村医疗所的医生来检查一次小孩的身体，如发现有传染病，立即隔离治疗。小孩出所入所都要交代情况，说明小孩有无疾病。
    第二，做到等价两利。办法是：按照小孩的年岁计分，两岁以下的小孩看管一天计二分五，四岁以下的计二分，四岁至六岁计一分。满了十分，就顶一个女全劳动力，按农忙期间评定的工资标准，给予报酬，或给工资，或换工上地，或帮助推碾、缝洗衣裳等工作。
    第三，加强对褓姆的政治思想教育。褓姆除按时参加读报组听读报外，每五天由专人到托儿所讲解一次政治时事问题，并发动褓姆订立爱国公约，把“操心看管小孩”这一条订在爱国公约里。同时由医生经常给褓姆讲解卫生常识。
    这样，托儿所便进一步巩固和提高了。
    托儿所成立以后，下地干活的妇女逐渐增加了。农民刘金元的老婆过去因为受三个孩子的牵累，啥活也不能干。现在她把孩子一齐送到托儿所里，和妇女变工锄麦子。今年全村共发展了十个托儿小组，有褓姆三十五个，看管着一百二十五个小孩，腾出九十八个妇女参加了农业生产。在抗旱防旱春耕播种工作中，妇女配合男人打井二十五眼，打蓄水池四个，拾了九百七十亩田里的谷槎。全村一千七百多亩麦田也大部由妇女锄过。由于大批妇女参加了农业生产，“土地加工”做得更好了，为一九五二年丰产打下了基础。妇女们的社会地位也随着提高了。许多男人说：“如今妇女们顶了大用啦。”此外，家里没有劳动力的老太太，也有了发挥力量的机会。如六十多岁的王果仙老太太，眼睛发花，干不了什么活，但在托儿所里当褓姆却很能行。她一个人看管着六个小孩，从去年春天到今年春天共得一千五百多分，合一百五十个工，每工以三升米计，可赚米四石五斗。她高兴地咧开嘴笑着说：“谁想到咱一个瞎老婆子也中了大用。”
    其次，农民之间的感情更融洽了，邻居关系也改善了。如马五儿和张贵生的小孩，以前常在一块打架，引起了双方家长的不和。现在两家的孩子都送到托儿所里，再不见有打架的事情了。许多妇女看到褓姆对自己的孩子那样关心，都自动地帮助她们做鞋、缝衣裳、梳头，亲如一家人。褓姆们抚摸着孩子的年青的母亲们说：“你们都像我的亲闺女一样。”
    孩子们也都养成了集体生活的习惯。有孩子的妇女们都说：“现在叫一个孩子呆在家里要，他就哭得不行，呆在一起就高兴得又蹦又跳，饭也不想吃了。”因此母亲们时常带孩子在一块做针线。
    西故县村有这样一首歌谣：“托儿所真正好，它的优点有三条，第一褓姆照顾好，孩子长得呱呱叫；第二生母放了心，上地齐把生产搞；第三培养后一代，对于社会有功劳。”附近村的群众也都夸奖西故县村，说庄稼长得旺，孩儿吃得胖，村里闲人少，街院时常扫。
    西故县村的农忙托儿所办成功了，长治专区卫生科、专区妇联会、屯留县人民政府及县民主妇女联合会都对它进行了奖励。为了推广这一经验，组织了附近十五个村，四百多人的观摩大会，用真人真事说明了农忙托儿所的优越性。西曲村妇女赵昌花看了托儿所以后说：“这个办法真是好，一春天我早想参加互助组，可是孩子累得我不能行。这回我回去也得搞个托儿所。”李家沟妇女王闺女说：“要是早知道这个办法，办起个托儿所来，俺家的苗子也不会荒。就是因为孩子累着咱，上不了地，又找不下忙工，才荒了地。回去咱也得向西故县学。”经过观摩以后，全县已有二十多村组织了农忙托儿所。襄垣、黎城、长治、壶关、武乡等地农民群众也纷纷组织了农忙托儿所。
