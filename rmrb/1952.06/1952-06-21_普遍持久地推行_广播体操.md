    Universally and Persistently Promote "Broadcast Calisthenics"
    Since its introduction, "Broadcast Calisthenics" has been welcomed by the vast majority of people across the country and valued by leadership organs in various regions. Many cities have established "Broadcast Calisthenics Promotion Committees." According to incomplete statistics from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jilin, Jiangsu, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, over two million people regularly participate in broadcast calisthenics, with 230,000 students in Beijing alone participating regularly. Preliminary statistics from over a dozen factories in Jilin City show that more than 3,000 workers regularly do broadcast calisthenics, accounting for 70% of the total workforce. "Broadcast Calisthenics" has gradually been extended from cities to some rural areas. In the Yanbei region of Chahar Province, more than 3,000 county and district cadres do calisthenics every day. Many people who participate in "Broadcast Calisthenics" unanimously report that they feel relaxed and refreshed, improving their work, production, and learning efficiency. Huang Yu-gui, a 51-year-old dockworker in Shanghai, said: "Before, if I didn't do calisthenics, my back ached and my legs hurt the day after working. Since doing calisthenics, my back doesn't ache, my legs don't hurt, and I have more energy for work..." Comrade Guo Xianlong of the CPC Pingyuan Provincial Huxi District Committee suffered from neurasthenia in 1950. He consulted many doctors and took a lot of medicine, but it didn't help. He couldn't even read books or newspapers. Later, he insisted on doing broadcast calisthenics every day. After a considerable period of time, his neuralgia improved, and his health gradually recovered. These specific examples prove that broadcast calisthenics has a significant impact on improving human health.
    However, on a national scale, the promotion of broadcast calisthenics is currently extremely uneven, not widespread, and not frequent. Some regions and units have not yet promoted broadcast calisthenics.
    The leading comrades of some units lack sufficient understanding of broadcast calisthenics. They believe that carrying out broadcast calisthenics will hinder production work, or they raise reasons such as not being able to spare time, lacking venues, or having scattered residences, adopting an indifferent attitude towards broadcast calisthenics. They do not know that the promotion of broadcast calisthenics has profound political significance. It can improve people's health and strengthen their physique, thereby helping people play a greater role in national defense and production construction. Broadcast calisthenics is a simple and easy exercise that can be done in the morning, noon, or evening; it can be done collectively or individually; it can be done in a square or indoors; it can be done by listening to the radio or records, or by asking someone to teach or looking at diagrams. What difficulties are there?
    Some people think that manual laborers do not need to do calisthenics. This view is incorrect. In fact, calisthenics is a preparatory activity for manual laborers before production and the best way to eliminate fatigue after production. Regular calisthenics can also correct certain deformities in the body caused by operating machines, thereby increasing labor productivity.
    There are also some people who, after doing calisthenics for a few days, expect to have thick legs and strong arms; otherwise, they become discouraged and cannot persevere. They do not know that calisthenics is the most basic and scientific fitness exercise. Only by doing it seriously day after day can one reap benefits and see results.
    Promoting broadcast calisthenics is an important step in popularizing sports. We must promote broadcast calisthenics to encourage the vast majority of people to participate in sports activities, cultivate a large number of sports activists, and lay the foundation for the widespread development of sports among the people, in order to prepare conditions for the implementation of the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" sports system nationwide in the future. Promoting broadcast calisthenics is one of the important and regular tasks of sports organizations at all levels, and they should supervise and assist factories, mines, and institutions.

### 普遍持久地推行“广播体操”

    普遍持久地推行“广播体操”
    “广播体操”推行后，已受到全国广大人民的欢迎和各地领导机关的重视。很多城市已成立了“广播体操推行委员会”。根据北京、天津、上海、吉林、江苏、河南和内蒙等地不完全的统计，经常参加广播体操的人已在二百万人以上，北京就有二十三万学生经常参加。据吉林市十几个工厂的初步统计，有三千多工人经常做广播体操，占总人数的百分之七十。“广播体操”已逐渐由城市推广到某些农村中去。察哈尔省雁北专区的八个县就有三千多个县区干部每天做体操。很多参加“广播体操”的群众都一致反映：做体操后全身轻松，精神振作，提高了工作、生产和学习效率。上海市五十一岁的码头老工人黄裕贵说：“以前不做体操，干一天活第二天起来腰酸腿疼。自从做体操后，腰不酸腿也不疼了，干活也增加了力气……”中共平原省湖西地委郭宪龙同志在一九五○年患神经衰弱病，找了好些医生，吃了很多药，也没治好，病得连书报都不能看；后来他每天坚持做广播体操，经过相当的时期以后，神经痛的现象已经好转，身体健康也逐渐恢复了。这些具体的例子证明了广播体操对改善人体健康有重大的作用。
    但是，从全国范围来说，目前广播体操活动开展得是极不平衡、不普遍、不经常的，有些地方和单位至今还没有推行广播体操。
    某些单位的领导同志对广播体操缺乏足够的认识。他们认为开展广播体操会妨碍生产工作，或提出抽不出时间、没场地、住地分散等理由，对广播体操采取漠视的态度；他们不知道广播体操的开展具有深刻的政治意义。它可以改进人民的健康状况、锻炼人民坚强的体魄，从而帮助人民在国防和生产建设等工作中发挥更大的作用。广播体操是一种简单易行的运动，既可在早晨做，也可在中午或晚上做；既可集体做，也可以单独做；既可以在广场上做，也可在室内做；既可听收音机听唱片做，也可请人教，看图解做。有什么困难呢？
    有些人认为体力劳动者不必做体操。这种看法是不对的。实际上，体操是体力劳动者生产前的准备活动，也是生产后消除疲劳的最好方法；经常做体操还可以矫正因操作机器所造成的身体的某些畸形的发展，而提高劳动生产率。
    也有一些人，做了几天体操，就想腿粗胳臂壮，否则，就心灰意懒，不能坚持。他们不知道体操是最基本的、科学的健身运动，只有认真地日复一日地做，才能收到益处，见到效果。
    推行广播体操活动，是普及体育运动的重要步骤，我们要通过推行广播体操，吸收广大人民群众参加体育活动，培养大批体育积极分子，在人民群众中打下广泛开展体育运动的基础，为将来在全国施行“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度准备条件。推行广播体操是当前各级体育组织重要的、经常的工作之一，它们应该对工厂、矿山和机关进行督促和帮助。
