Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 12th. Following concrete trade negotiations based on the £10 million trade agreement signed by the delegations of the two countries attending the Moscow International Economic Conference, the trade representatives of China and Britain signed the first batch of sales estimate contracts in Berlin on the 9th. Lu Xuzhang, Manager of the China National Import and Export Corporation, signed on behalf of the Chinese side, and Labour Party MP Silverman, appointed as the chief negotiator by Boyd-Orr, head of the British delegation to the Moscow International Economic Conference, signed on behalf of the British side. Seven other individuals representing the British chemical and textile industries also participated in the negotiations.

The negotiations were conducted based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and promotion of Sino-British trade, and satisfactory results are expected soon.

After signing the sales estimate contracts on the 9th, the representatives of China and Britain issued the following joint statement:

    The representatives of China and Britain are conducting negotiations to implement the agreement between the British delegation and the delegation of the People's Republic of China at the Moscow International Economic Conference. The negotiations began on June 6th and are currently ongoing.

    During the negotiations, the representatives of both sides discussed general issues related to banking affairs, pound payments, transportation, and technical issues, and reached satisfactory resolutions on these issues. In addition, the two sides negotiated on individual types of goods, some of which have been agreed upon, and others are progressing smoothly.

    The following agreement has been reached regarding the quantity and type of textiles worth a total of £3.5 million:

    1. Wool tops - £1.7 million
    2. Raw wool - £300,000
    3. Cotton yarn - £900,000
    4. Wool yarn - £300,000
    5. Rayon - £300,000

    A similar agreement has also been reached on chemical goods:

    1. Organic chemicals - £750,000
    2. Industrial chemicals - £1.1 million
    3. Medical chemicals - £1.15 million

    Subsequently, the Chinese representatives put forward some proposals specifying the categories of Chinese export goods, which are soybeans, bristles, tung oil, frozen eggs, oilseeds, oil cakes, animal products, and other Chinese products that have a traditional market in Britain.

    Negotiations are currently underway regarding other goods (such as metals and others).

    Of course, it must be clearly understood that, according to the original agreement, the sale of textiles and chemicals that Britain can export to China depends on whether British merchants can purchase the already agreed-upon Chinese products.

    The negotiations are being conducted entirely on a purely commercial basis, and the situation of the negotiations gives reason to believe that the transactions stipulated in the original trade agreement will be completed satisfactorily.

    中英签订第一批售货估计合同
    总值六百五十万英镑的纺织品和化学品已达成协议
    【新华社柏林十二日电】中英两国贸易谈判代表，在根据两国出席莫斯科国际经济会议代表团所缔结的一千万英镑贸易协议书进行了具体的贸易谈判以后，已于九日在柏林签订了第一批售货估计合同。代表中国方面签字的是中国进出口公司经理卢绪章，代表英国方面签字的是由英国参加莫斯科国际经济会议代表团团长波以德—奥尔任命为首席谈判代表的工党议员锡尔佛曼。参加谈判的还有代表英国化学工业和纺织工业的其他七位人士。
    谈判是根据平等互利促进中英贸易的原则进行的，预料不久就可以获得满意的结果。
    中英双方代表在九日签订了售货估计合同以后，曾发表联合声明如下：
    中英双方代表按照英国代表团与中华人民共和国代表团在莫斯科国际经济会议上所缔结的贸易协议书，正在进行谈判以实现双方的协定，谈判从六月六日起开始，目前仍在进行中。
    双方代表在谈判中讨论了有关银行事务、英镑付款、运输等一般问题以及有关的技术问题，并在这些问题上获得了满意的解决。此外，双方又就个别几种货物进行了谈判，这些谈判，有的已经达成协议，有的正在顺利地进行中。
    关于总值三百五十万英镑的纺织品的数量和种类，已经达成了如下的协议：
    一、毛条——一百七十万英镑
    二、原毛——三十万英镑
    三、棉纱——九十万英镑
    四、毛纱——三十万英镑
    五、人造丝——三十万英镑
    关于化学货品，也达成了相似的协议：
    一、有机化学品——七十五万英镑
    二、工业化学品——一百一十万英镑
    三、医疗化学品——一百一十五万英镑
    随后中国代表又提出了一些建议，规定了中国输出货物的类别，这些货物是大豆、猪鬃、桐油、冻蛋、榨油种籽、油饼、畜产品及其他在英国有传统市场的中国产品。
    关于其他货品（例如金属品及其他），目前正在谈判中。
    当然，必须清楚地了解：根据原来的协定，英国所能输往中国的纺织品和化学品，其出售须视英国商人能否购入已经协议之中国产品而定。
    谈判完全是在纯粹商业的基础上进行的，谈判的情况令人相信：原来贸易协定所规定的交易，一定会满意地完成。
