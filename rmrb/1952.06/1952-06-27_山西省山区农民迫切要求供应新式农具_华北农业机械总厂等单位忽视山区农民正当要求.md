    Shanxi Province Mountainous Area Farmers Urgently Request Supply of New Agricultural Tools
    North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and Other Units Neglect Mountainous Area Farmers' Legitimate Demands
    According to a letter from the Agricultural Tool Section of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union, farmers in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province are urgently requesting the use of new agricultural tools, but the relevant leading authorities have long failed to pay attention to this legitimate demand of the farmers. In 1950, Shanxi Province held an agricultural exhibition. The masses in the mountainous areas were very happy to see the new agricultural tool—the mountain plow—at the exhibition, and they asked the People's Government to supply this plow so as to improve the efficiency of land cultivation. Since the launch of the patriotic production increase competition this year, the masses in various places have become even more eager to use new agricultural tools. At the Provincial People's Congress alone, representatives from mountainous areas have made more than 40 suggestions. The number of suggestions made to newspapers, cooperatives, and government systems is even more difficult to calculate. However, this correct demand of the farmers has not been resolved. The mountainous area farmers are very dissatisfied with this matter.
    In order to solve this problem, we have repeatedly made requests to the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and proactively offered our opinions on the improved mountain plow that the factory provided to our province for testing in 1950, hoping that they would quickly study and remake it, and supply it to the farmers as soon as possible. However, the factory did not pay attention to this matter. In early May of this year, the factory wrote to us saying: "This factory is not currently manufacturing mountain plows." On May 10th, we also sent a letter to the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory, and their reply was also "Regarding mountain plows, this factory has not manufactured them." According to the decision of the National Agricultural Tool Conference in December 1951, the design and research work of mountain plows was the responsibility of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and the Northwest Agricultural Tool Research Institute, but they have failed to implement the resolutions of the National Agricultural Tool Conference. We request the Central Ministry of Agriculture to quickly resolve this issue.
    Reply from the Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture
    The opinions raised in the letter from the Agricultural Tool Section of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union are correct. The new mountain plow was trial-produced by the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and is currently being redesigned. However, the factory has not actively carried out this work, and we have not done a good job in supervising and inspecting, resulting in the new mountain plow not being trial-produced quickly and meeting the production needs of the mountainous area masses as soon as possible. This should be reviewed.
    In 1950, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory trial-produced six mountain plows and distributed them to Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other places for trial use, asking various places to put forward improvement suggestions for research and redesign. However, except for the Changzhi Agricultural Tool Station in Shanxi Province, the other places did not report the test results. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory did not actively urge inquiries, so it could not be improved and manufactured again in time according to the opinions of the broad masses. The National Agricultural Tool Conference at the end of 1951 decided that the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory should cooperate with the Northwest Agricultural Tool Research Institute to study and design mountain agricultural tools in 1952. This spring, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory started to redesign according to the original drawings, and models were made in May, and it is expected that ten units can be trial-produced by the end of July. Recently, we have notified the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to speed up the trial production of mountain plows and transport them to mountainous areas for trial use before the end of July; and ordered the factory to solve the difficulties of agricultural tools in mountainous areas as soon as possible.
    At present, the new mountain plow is still in the trial production stage, but it cannot be manufactured in large quantities. Terraces and gently sloping land in general mountainous areas can temporarily use the new 7-inch walking plow or 5-inch walking plow. For example, the mountainous area of Yuanzhuang Village, Lingchuan, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, has completely used new walking plows for cultivation. Labor model Lian Quanbao has also researched some techniques for using new plows and taught them to the masses. The Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union can work with the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to study and summarize these experiences for promotion, so as to temporarily solve the problem of farmers in mountainous areas needing new mountain plows.
        Editor's Note: Mountainous area farmers urgently demand the use of new agricultural tools in order to increase production, and this demand is completely correct. All relevant parties should fully support it. However, judging from the letter from the Agricultural Tool Section of the Shanxi Provincial Cooperative Union, the relevant authorities have demonstrated a serious bureaucratic style in this matter. Now we have published the reply from the Central Ministry of Agriculture on this issue, and we suggest that other units that have dealt with this issue, such as the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, immediately conduct inspections and publicly reply.

### 山西省山区农民迫切要求供应新式农具  华北农业机械总厂等单位忽视山区农民正当要求

    山西省山区农民迫切要求供应新式农具
    华北农业机械总厂等单位忽视山区农民正当要求
    据山西省合作社联合社农具科来信称：山西省山区农民迫切要求使用新式农具，但有关领导机关对农民的这种正当要求，却长期没有重视。一九五○年山西省举办了农业展览会。山区群众在展览会上看到了新式农具——山地犁，都非常高兴，纷纷要求人民政府供给这种犁，以便提高耕地的效率。今年全国开展爱国丰产竞赛以来，各地群众对使用新式农具的要求更加迫切了。只是在省人民代表会议上，山区代表就提出过四十多次建议，至于向报社、合作社及政府系统提出建议的次数，更是难以计算。但是农民的这个正确要求却一直没有得到解决。山区农民对这件事很不满意。
    为了解决这个问题，我们曾经多次向华北农业机械总厂提出要求，并主动地对一九五○年该厂交给我省试验的山地犁提出改进意见，希望他们迅速研究重制，及早供给农民使用。但是该厂并没有重视这件事。今年五月初，该厂来信说：“本厂现不制造山地犁。”五月十日，我们又函询西北农业机械厂，他们的答复同样是“关于山地犁，本厂并未制造”。根据一九五一年十二月全国农具会议的决定，山地犁的设计研究工作是由华北农业机械总厂和西北农具研究所负责的，但他们竟不执行全国农具会议的决议。我们要求中央农业部迅速解决这个问题。
    中央人民政府农业部的答复
    山西省合作社联合社农具科来信中提出的意见是正确的。新式山地犁曾由华北农业机械总厂试制，现正设计改制。但该厂对这一工作并没有积极进行，我们也没有很好地督促检查，致使新式山地犁未能很快试制出来，提早满足山区群众生产的需要。这是应该检讨的。
    一九五○年华北农业机械总厂试制了六部山地犁，分发到山西、陕西等地试用，请各地提出改进意见，以便研究改制。但是，除了山西省长治农具站外，其余各地都没有把试验结果报告上来。华北农业机械总厂也没有主动催询，以致不能及时根据广大群众的意见加以改进，再行制造。一九五一年年底全国农具会议曾决定在一九五二年由华北农业机械总厂配合西北农具研究所研究设计山地农具。今年春天，华北农业机械总厂根据原来的图样着手重新设计，五月间已制出模型，预计七月底可以试制十部。最近我们已经通知华北农业机械总厂加紧完成山地犁的试制工作，在七月底以前运至山区试用；并责成该厂及早解决山区农具的困难问题。
    目前，新式山地犁尚在试制阶段，但还不能大量制造。一般山区的梯田及坡度不大的土地，暂时可以使用新式七吋步犁或五吋步犁。如山西省长治专区陵川原庄村的山地，已全部使用新式步犁耕作。劳动模范连全保并且研究出一些使用新式犁的技术，向群众传授。山西省合作社联合社可以和山西省农林厅共同研究，把这些经验加以总结推广，以便暂时解决山区农民需要新式山地犁的问题。
        编者按：山区农民为了提高生产，迫切要求使用新式农具，这个要求是完全正确的。各有关方面应该全力加以支持。但是从山西省合作社联合社农具科的来信看来，有关机关在这个问题上却表现了严重的官僚主义作风。现在我们发表了中央农业部对这一问题的答复，并建议曾经处理过这个问题的其他单位，如华北农业机械总厂等，立即进行检查，并公开答复。
