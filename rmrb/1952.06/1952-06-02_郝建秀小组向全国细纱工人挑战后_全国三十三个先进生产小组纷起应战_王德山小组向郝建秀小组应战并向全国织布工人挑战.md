After the Hao Jianxiu Group of the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory issued a patriotic production increase and thrift competition challenge to the nation's fine yarn workers, it inspired great enthusiasm for production among the vast number of textile workers. Thirty-three advanced production groups in cotton textile factories across the country have successively proposed to accept the challenge. Among the groups responding to the challenge are the Huang Renmei, Li Shuying, Chen Shude, and Gao Guilan groups in Qingdao, the Sun Guilan, Zhang Minglan, and Li Shumin groups in Tianjin, the Dong Lili, Yi Shijuan, Lu Jindi, and Jiang Linmei groups in Shanghai, the Li Xiaying group in Southern Jiangsu, the Chen Shulan group in Southwest China, and the He Xiulian group in Shijiazhuang.

In the conditions of accepting the challenge, all groups stipulated that they would conscientiously study and thoroughly implement the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The Qingdao groups accepting the challenge also put forward specific standards to be achieved in implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The Li Shuying group plans to reach over 96 points, and the Huang Renmei group strives to reach 95 points (according to the Qingdao unified measurement and scoring standards).

In terms of increasing production, the Xu Huiyun and Shen Fuying group of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory proposed to increase the production of cotton yarn by 300 bales within the year. The Wang Gendi and Wang Laixiang group of the State-owned Shanghai No. 15 Cotton Textile Factory guarantees to increase the production of cotton yarn by 55.16 bales per group per month.

In terms of reducing roller flowers and improving quality, the Gao Guilan group of the State-owned Qingdao No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory guarantees that the roller flower rate will not exceed 0.45%, and strives to avoid producing fuzzy and defective yarn. The Pan Fengying and Tang Fumei group of the State-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory guarantees that the roller flower rate will not exceed 0.4%, the total waste yarn of the group will not exceed ten taels per day, the roving ends will not exceed four taels, and the number of empty spindles will not exceed one in ten thousand.

In terms of establishing systems, the Tianjin groups responding to the challenge generally proposed to strengthen the group economic accounting system. The Sun Guilan group plans to further improve the existing economic accounting system, establish chain groups, and respond to the call of Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, to gradually establish a weighing system for the receipt and delivery of roving and fine yarn.

Groups in private textile factories also initiated challenges. They especially put forward conditions such as urging capitalists to abide by national laws and consolidate the victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle. The Li Xiaying group of the Lixin Yarn Factory, a private enterprise in Wuxi, proposed conditions such as preventing capitalists from cutting corners, actively making rationalization proposals, and assisting capitalists in improving production management systems. The Chen Shulan group of the Shashi Yarn Factory, a private enterprise in Chongqing, proposed conditions such as urging capitalists to conscientiously implement the contracts signed with the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation.

The challenge of the Hao Jianxiu group not only inspired the fine yarn workers, but also promoted the workers in other workshops. Ninety-seven groups and workshops in the front spinning, preparation, weaving, maintenance, repair, and power departments of the Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory have formulated their own production increase and thrift plans to respond to the challenge of the Hao Jianxiu group. Workers in the opening, roving, and cone winding workshops of the State-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory, in order to cooperate with and support the Dong Lili group of the fine yarn workshop in accepting the challenge, guarantee to produce more laps, without oil stains, and without defective rovings.

The Wang Deshan group, where national labor model Wang Deshan is located, of the State-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, responded to the challenge of the Hao Jianxiu group and challenged the nation's weaving workers. Their response and challenge are published below: Hao Jianxiu Group and fellow weaving workers across the country:

In order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "increasing production and practicing thrift" and to welcome the nation's large-scale economic construction, our group has specially formulated a plan to increase the production of 14-pound cloth by 4,639.08 pieces (equivalent to 4,827.89 pieces of people's cloth, 120 Toyota ordinary looms) within this year (starting from June 1st), and reduce the value of waste silk machine materials and labor equivalent to 35,242.89 catties of fiscal rice. We specially take this goal and the following conditions to respond to the challenge of the Hao Jianxiu group, and to launch a friendly patriotic production increase and thrift competition challenge to the nation's weaving workers:

(1) Further improve the economic accounting system that the group has already implemented, and gradually promote it to the entire workshop, laying the foundation for the workshop's economic accounting.

(2) The group members guarantee to implement the 1951 Weaving Work Method 100%, and the unit output of each machine for 14-pound cloth will be 7.77% higher than the administrative plan (administrative plan of 34.5 yards). The group's regular cloth rate is guaranteed to reach 98.94%, and the 1951 Weaving Work Method score is guaranteed to reach an average of 87 points according to the factory's measurement and scoring standards (full score is 90 points).

(3) Conscientiously implement the patriotic health and epidemic prevention conventions, and the attendance rate is guaranteed to reach 98%.

(4) Strengthen political, cultural, and technical learning, read the newspaper once a day, and study current affairs. 100% of the group members participate in amateur schools or accelerated literacy classes. Conduct technical learning once a week, with maintenance workers lecturing on technology.

(5) Do a good job of shift handover and safety work to ensure no personal or machine accidents occur.

(6) Strengthen the connection between the three shifts, hold a connection meeting once a month, and hold a group meeting once a week for each shift to check the completion of the plan and carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    郝建秀小组向全国细纱工人挑战后
    全国三十三个先进生产小组纷起应战
    王德山小组向郝建秀小组应战并向全国织布工人挑战
    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂郝建秀小组向全国细纱工人发出的爱国增产节约竞赛挑战书，鼓舞了广大纺织工人的生产热情。全国各地棉纺织厂已经有三十三个先进生产小组先后提出应战。在应战的小组中，有青岛黄人美、李书英、陈淑德、高桂兰小组，天津孙桂兰、张明兰、李淑敏小组，上海董莉莉、裔式娟、陆金弟、姜林妹小组，苏南李霞影小组，西南陈树兰小组，石家庄何秀莲小组等。
    各小组在应战条件中都规定了要认真学习和彻底实行郝建秀工作法。青岛各应战小组并且提出了实行郝建秀工作法要达到的具体的标准。李书英小组计划达到九十六分以上，黄人美小组争取达到九十五分（按青岛统一测定评分标准）。
    在提高产量方面，国营上海第一棉纺织厂徐惠芸、沈富英小组提出要在年内增产棉纱三百件。国营上海第十五棉纺织厂王根弟、王来香小组，保证每月每组增产棉纱五十五点一六件。
    在减少皮辊花和提高质量方面，国营青岛第二棉纺织厂高桂兰小组，保证皮辊花率不超过百分之零点四五，争取不出毛头和毛脚纱。国营上海第九棉纺织厂潘凤英、唐福妹小组，保证皮辊花率不超过百分之零点四，全组每日回丝不超过十两，粗纱头不超过四两，空锭不超过万分之一。
    在建立制度方面，天津各应战小组普遍提出要加强小组经济核算制。孙桂兰小组计划把已经实行的经济核算制提高一步，建立连环小组，并响应中国纺织工会全国委员会陈少敏主席号召，逐步建立粗纱细纱收付过磅制度。
    私营纺织厂也有小组发起应战。他们特别提出了督促资方遵守国家法令，巩固“五反”斗争的胜利果实等条件。无锡私营丽新纱厂李霞影小组，提出防止资方偷工减料，积极提合理化建议，协助资方改进生产管理制度等条件。重庆私营沙市纱厂陈树兰小组，提出督促资方认真执行和国营花纱布公司订立的合同等条件。
    郝建秀小组的挑战，不但鼓舞了细纱工人，同时也推动了其他车间的工人。青岛棉纺织厂已有前纺、准备、织布、保全、修机，原动等部门九十七个小组和车间，订出自己的增产节约计划，向郝建秀小组应战。国营上海第十七棉纺织厂清花、粗纱、筒子车间工人，为配合和支援细纱车间董莉莉小组的应战，保证多出花卷，不出油渍条子、坏粗纱等。                （钱大东）
