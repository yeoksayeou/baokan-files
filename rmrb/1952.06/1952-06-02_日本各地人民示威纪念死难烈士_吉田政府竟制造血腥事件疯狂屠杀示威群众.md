    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st: As the bloodstains of the "May Day" tragedy in Japan are not yet dry, the Yoshida reactionary government created a new bloody incident on May 30th, once again slaughtering and arresting large numbers of Japanese patriotic people.
    May 30th is a day of sorrowful remembrance for the Japanese people. On this day in 1949, transportation worker Kinji Hashimoto was beaten to death by police while participating in a Tokyo labor protest against the "Public Safety Ordinance" banning demonstrations and marches. A year later, on the same day, tens of thousands of Tokyo laborers held a rally to commemorate Hashimoto Kinji and oppose the war policies of the American and Japanese reactionaries. They were subjected to the brutal suppression of the American and Japanese reactionaries, and eight Japanese patriots were unreasonably sentenced to long terms of hard labor by the American military court. This year, in order to commemorate these martyrs and events, to hold a funeral for the martyrs who were slaughtered in this year's "May Day" tragedy, and to protest the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Act," they decided to hold nationwide rallies, demonstrations, and marches on May 30th. The Yoshida government made arrangements in advance to carry out bloody suppression of this peaceful movement of the people. According to Kyodo News, it convened an "emergency security conference" on the 28th, ordering the entire country to "strengthen precautions." Based on this order, the Tokyo police authorities decided to ban all outdoor gatherings from the 29th to the 31st, and mobilized all 20,000 police officers to "lay down an emergency alert formation" during these three days.
    However, the heroic and unyielding Japanese people still carried out demonstrations across the country on the 30th according to their plan. According to the police authorities, gatherings and demonstrations took place in 62 locations in major Japanese cities. In Tokyo, workers, students, and people from other social strata gathered and demonstrated in the plaza in front of Shinjuku Station, with slogans on their placards such as "Down with the Yoshida government," "Let us stop rearmament," and "Abolish the Subversive Activities Prevention Act." As the demonstration was in progress, thousands of armed police officers, at the sound of bugles, inflicted frantic beatings, shootings, and arrests on the masses. According to statistics from the Tokyo police authorities at 1:00 AM on the 31st, under the police's frantic suppression, three people died, dozens were slightly injured, and another 35 were arrested.
    In Sapporo, Sendai, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka, the demonstrators were also subjected to bloody suppression by armed police. According to the National Regional Police Headquarters, as of 11:30 PM on the 30th, 103 people had been arrested across the country, and the number of dead and injured was not yet available.

    日本各地人民示威纪念死难烈士
    吉田政府竟制造血腥事件疯狂屠杀示威群众
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：在日本“五一”惨案血迹未干之际，吉田反动政府又在五月三十日制造新的血腥事件，再一次大批屠杀和逮捕日本爱国人民。
    五月三十日是日本人民悲痛的纪念日。在一九四九年的这一天，交通工人桥本金二在参加东京劳动人民反对禁止示威和游行等的“公安条例”时，被警察活活地打死。一年以后的这一天，数万东京劳动人民举行大会纪念桥本金二和反对美、日反动派的战争政策。他们受到美、日反动派的横暴镇压，并有八名日本爱国者被美国军事法庭无理判处长期苦役。今年，日本人民为了纪念这些先烈和事件，为了为在今年“五一”惨案中被屠杀的死难烈士举行葬仪，为了抗议法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”，他们决定在五月三十日举行全国规模的集会、示威和游行。吉田政府对于人民的这个和平运动，事先就作了进行血腥镇压的部署。据共同社讯，它在二十八日召开了“紧急治安会议”，命令全国“严加防备”。东京警察当局根据这个命令，决定从二十九日起到三十一日止，禁止一切室外集会，并动员全部二万多名警察在这三天中“布下紧急戒备的阵势”。
    但是，英勇不屈的日本人民依然按照他们的计划于三十日在全国各地举行了示威运动。据警察当局宣布，在日本各大城市中，有六十二处举行集会和示威游行。在东京，工人、学生和其他阶层的人民在新宿车站前的广场集会并示威，他们的标语牌上写着：“打倒吉田政府”、“让我们停止重新武装”、“废除防止破坏活动法案”等口号。示威在进行着的时候，成千名的武装警察在冲锋号声中对群众施行疯狂的殴打、枪杀和逮捕。据东京警察当局三十一日上午一时的统计，在警察的疯狂镇压之下，死者三人，轻伤者数十人，另有三十五人被捕。
    在扎幌、仙台、大阪、广岛和福冈等地，示威群众也同样地受到武装警察的血腥镇压。据国家地方警察本部发表，截至三十日晚间十一时三十分为止，全国各地已经逮捕了一百零三人，死伤人数尚无统计。
