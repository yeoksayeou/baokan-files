Xinhua News Agency Report: People from all circles in East China and Shanghai, as well as Shenyang, held rallies on the 10th to support the French people's movement to defend peace and protest the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos. The rally held at the Shanghai Cultural Square was attended by over ten thousand people, including workers, farmers, women, students, representatives from cultural, scientific, religious, and business circles, and staff members from government organizations. Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, representing the people of Shanghai, expressed sincere respect to the French people who oppose the American war policy and defend world peace, and angrily protested against the fascist atrocities committed by the French government under the instigation of American imperialism. Liu Changsheng said: "The strength of the French people is powerful. The French people not only have a glorious tradition of heroic struggle but also have the correct leadership of the French Communist Party. The French government's arrest of the French people's leader Duclos and other French patriots does not demonstrate its strength but precisely its weakness. The French reactionary government's atrocities are part of the American aggressors' conspiracy to intensify their war plans. People all over the world must unite more closely to jointly oppose the insidious new war preparations of American imperialism and resolutely defend peace." Zhang Shibao, a model worker from the Shanghai Power Company, said with indignation: "What's wrong with Duclos leading the French people to strive for independence and freedom? What's wrong with Duclos and the French people opposing the arrival in France of Ridgway, the butcher who massacred the Korean people, to harm the French people? We, the million workers of Shanghai, resolutely protest against this reactionary behavior of the French government and demand that the French government immediately release Duclos and other patriots!" Xia Yan, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: "Now, Paris has become a new Bastille prison. These lackeys are dreaming of using the customary methods of medieval tyrants and fascist bandits to suppress the French people's determination to fight for democracy and peace. However, they are bound to fail. The French people, who maintain the glorious traditions of the Paris Commune, will certainly defeat the reactionary conspiracy of the French government. Let us use the stronger peace movement of the people all over the world to repel the provocations of the American war-mongers! Let us use mass actions on a world scale to win back Duclos!" Wu Xuezhou, Director of the Shanghai Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Deng Yuzhi, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, unanimously stated in their speeches: The French government must be warned to immediately stop the persecution of French patriots and immediately release Duclos, Stie, and all the arrested French patriots. After the speeches by representatives from all walks of life, Shu Tong, the chairman of the meeting, addressed the meeting, saying: "We must actively work hard to support the struggle of the French people because the victory of the French people is the victory of the people of the world, and it is also the great victory of the world's peace movement!" During the meeting, the emotions of all the attendees were high, and they constantly shouted slogans such as "Down with the germ warfare criminal Ridgway!", "Support the French people's patriotic movement!", "Demand that the French government immediately release Duclos!", "Oppose aggressive war, defend world peace!" Finally, the meeting adopted a telegram from the people of East China and Shanghai supporting the French people's patriotic movement and protesting against the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos and other patriots.

At a rally of two thousand people from all circles in Shenyang, Zhang Like, Chairman of the Shenyang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, in his opening remarks, expressed firm support on behalf of the people of Shenyang for the French people's patriotic movement to defend peace and paid tribute to the heroic French Communist Party and the French people. Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his speech: We, the people of Northeast China and Shenyang, firmly stand with the heroic French people, and we express our sincere respect and warm support to the French people. At the same time, we strongly protest to the French government and demand the immediate release of Duclos, Stie, and all French patriots, and the immediate cessation of the fascist suppression of the French people's patriotic movement. We believe that the heroic French people's struggle for peace, independence, freedom, and democracy will surely be victorious. Jin Shuliang, President of the Northeast Institute of Technology, continued to speak, saying: Ridgway, this germ warfare criminal, is particularly familiar and hateful to the people of Northeast China. Chinese scientific workers have personally investigated his crimes. Now that he has arrived in France, he is preparing for another devastating war in Western Europe, which is intolerable to the French people and the people of the world. Chinese scientific workers deeply sympathize with and support the just struggle of the French people. Writer Cao Ming said in his speech: People all over the world know that Ridgway is a plague god sent by Wall Street. Wherever he goes, terror, plague, and death follow. The French people's opposition to Ridgway's arrival in Paris is entirely out of righteous and wise action. The French government's fascist acts of persecuting patriotic people will not have any result other than further exposing its betrayal of the people. Zhu Weiren, Vice Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, Fan Zheng, Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Democratic Youth, Hou Zhi, Director of the Shenyang Federation of Democratic Women, Zheng Wen, Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and others also spoke at the meeting. All speakers enthusiastically wished the French people victory in their just struggle. The meeting passed a telegram in support of the French people.

    华东和上海、沈阳各界人民集会
    声援法国人民抗议逮捕杜克洛
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：华东和上海各界人民，沈阳各界人民分别在十日举行声援法国人民保卫和平运动、抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛大会。在上海文化广场举行的大会上有工人、农民、妇女、学生和文化、科学、宗教、工商界人士及机关工作者万余人参加。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海分会主席刘长胜代表上海各界人民对反对美国战争政策、保卫世界和平的法国人民表示衷心的敬意，并愤怒抗议法国政府在美帝国主义唆使下所进行的法西斯暴行。刘长胜说：“法国人民的力量是强大的，法国人民不仅有英勇斗争的光荣传统，而且有法国共产党的正确领导。法国比内政府逮捕法国人民领袖杜克洛及其他法国爱国人士，并不是表示它的有力量，恰是表示它的软弱。法国反动政府的暴行是美国侵略者加紧推行战争计划的阴谋的一部分，全世界人民必须更紧密地团结起来，共同反对美帝国主义阴险的新备战步骤，坚决保卫和平。”劳动模范、上海电力公司工人张世宝激愤地说：“杜克洛领导法国人民争取独立、争自由，有什么不应该？杜克洛和法国人民反对屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手李奇微到法国来危害法国人民，这又有什么不应该？我们上海百万工人坚决抗议法国政府这种反动的行为，要求法国政府马上把杜克洛和其他的爱国者释放出来！”上海市文学艺术界联合会主席夏衍说：“现在，巴黎成了新的巴士底监狱，这些奴才幻想用中世纪暴君和法西斯匪帮的惯用手段，来压服法兰西人民争民主、争和平的决心。但是，他们一定要失败的。保持着巴黎公社的光荣传统的法兰西人民，一定能打败法国政府的反动阴谋。让我们用全世界人民的更强大的和平运动来打退美国战争贩子的挑衅！让我们用世界规模的群众行动来夺回杜克洛！”中国科学院上海物理化学研究所长吴学周、上海市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华、中华基督教女青年会总干事邓裕志在发言中一致表示：要正告法国政府立即停止对法国爱国人士的迫害，并立即释放杜克洛、斯梯及所有被捕的法国爱国人士。大会主席舒同继各界代表讲话之后向大会致词说：“我们一定要积极努力，支援法国人民的斗争，因为法国人民的胜利就是世界人民的胜利，也就是全世界保卫和平运动的伟大胜利！”大会进行中，全体到会群众情绪激昂，不断高呼：“打倒细菌战犯李奇微！”“声援法国人民的爱国运动！”“要求法国政府立即释放杜克洛！”“反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平！”等口号。大会最后通过华东和上海各界人民声援法国人民爱国运动和抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛等爱国人士的电文。
    在沈阳各界人民两千人的集会上，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会沈阳市分会主席张力克在开会词中，代表沈阳市各界人民对法国人民保卫和平的爱国运动表示坚决支持，并向英勇斗争的法国共产党和法国人民致敬。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会东北总分会主席高崇民在讲话中指出：我们东北和沈阳各界人民是坚决站在英勇的法国人民一起的，我们向法国人民表示衷心的敬意和热烈的声援。同时，我们向法国政府坚决抗议，要求立即释放杜克洛、斯梯及一切法国爱国人士，立即停止对法国人民爱国运动的法西斯镇压。我们相信：英勇的法国人民争取和平、独立、自由、民主的斗争一定会获得胜利。东北工学院院长靳树梁接着讲话，他说：李奇微这个细菌战犯，东北人民对他特别熟悉，也特别愤恨，中国的科学工作者曾经亲身调查过他的罪证。现在他到了法国，是要在西欧准备再次毁灭性的战争，这是法国人民和全世界人民所不能容忍的。中国科学工作者深切同情并支持法国人民的正义斗争。作家草明在讲话中说：全世界人民都知道，李奇微是华尔街派出的瘟神，他到那里，恐怖、瘟疫和死亡就到那里，法国人民反对李奇微到达巴黎，完全是出于正义和明智的行动。法国比内政府迫害爱国人民的法西斯行为，除了进一步暴露它背叛人民的面目之外，是不会有任何结果的。在会上讲话的还有沈阳市总工会副主席朱维仁、沈阳市民主青年联合会主席范政、沈阳市民主妇女联合会主任侯志、沈阳市文学艺术界联合会主席郑文等人。所有发言者都满怀热情地预祝法国人民正义斗争的胜利。大会通过了声援法国人民的电报。
