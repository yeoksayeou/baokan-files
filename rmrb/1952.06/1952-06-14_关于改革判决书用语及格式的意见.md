Opinions on Reforming Legal Judgment Terminology and Format
    Xie Bangmin

    Although the People's Government abolished the Six Codes long ago, even today, "judicial stereotypes" and legal terminology still frequently appear in the judgments of the People's judicial organs. The harm it causes is not only as Deng Tinghuan said in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 21st: "... the working class and peasantry cannot understand it. Some farmers have to go several miles to find someone to explain the content of the judgment"; moreover, it has also intimidated many judicial cadres with lower or some education, but who have not studied the Six Codes, making them feel that "it is too difficult to write a judgment" and want to "change careers." This cannot but be considered an important problem in the people's judicial work.

    I work at the Beijing Municipal People's Court. I often have feelings about this phenomenon. Now I would like to put forward the following opinions on reforming judicial documents and study them with everyone.

    A judgment is one of the forms in which the People's Court indicates its handling result to the parties involved and the general public for a certain case. Therefore, the judgment should let the people understand how the case was handled and why it was handled that way. A good judgment should be clear on the facts, conform to policies, and be fully convincing. According to this requirement, the judgment should obviously be easy to understand. The most important thing to do to make it easy to understand is to abolish the "judicial stereotypes" style. The judgments of the People's Courts should be written in common vernacular Chinese. However, current judgments are still full of classical Chinese that the masses cannot understand, and even some extremely antiquated phrases. Such as: "grant" admonishment, "difficult to shirk responsibility," "empty words," "deceptive arguments," "clearly visible," "obvious," "obviously insufficient to adopt," "check," "verified," etc. Since the masses cannot understand these words, they should no longer be used. The standard for the selection of vocabulary in the judgment can only be: what is in the public language, what the public can understand, and, moreover, the above words, such as "obviously insufficient to adopt" and "obvious," can be completely expressed in vernacular Chinese. For example, use "the matter is very clear" to replace "obvious," and use "obviously incorrect" to replace "obviously insufficient to adopt."

    Legal terms that were used to confuse and rule the people under the reactionary regime should have been eliminated long ago with the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime. When the people's law is growing but not yet complete, if there is written law, the terms in one's own law should be used. For example: one can use "divorce" according to the Marriage Law, instead of "marital separation"; "both parties" are "both parties," and do not need to be called "two parties." If there is no written law but it is actually needed, one can write out the original meaning. For example, it can be recorded as "this case should be executed immediately and not be suspended due to one party's declaration of appeal," instead of "provisional execution"; in specific cases, it is better to call it "legal social organization" instead of "legal person," etc. Also, legal terms that are only understood by "insiders" and can be completely omitted in the judgment, such as: "party not qualified," "subject of litigation," "unjustified enrichment," etc., should no longer be used.

    In a civil judgment, if it is necessary to record the points of contention between the two parties, it is not necessary to write down the plaintiff's request that has no factual basis, as long as it is explained to him clearly in court. If it is necessary to describe the facts of the crime in a criminal judgment, only the main facts should be written, and it is not necessary to write down the details that are not related to the sentence. For example: when writing a judgment on a case of local bully, it is enough to write down one or two representative offenses from his crimes, and then summarize the number of similar behaviors. There is no need to narrate them one by one. I have seen a judgment on a case of a big local bully that even wrote down details such as "trampled the Wang's chickens to death," which is unnecessary. As for describing a criminal fact, it is only necessary to state the perpetrator, the victim, the time, the place, the important process (such as the means), and the result, without having to write down every process in which the fact occurred.

    In terms of format, the currently used judgment format of separate "main text," "facts," and "reasons" is also the shell of "judicial stereotypes." With it, it is inevitable to fill in many unnecessary but confusing words in a fixed pattern. Therefore, I think this format can generally be abolished.

    Having abolished this format, there is no need to rush to design another fixed form to replace it. From actual work, according to different cases and different handling results, boldly create formats that are adapted to them, and then select one or several formats, so that a new type of judgment will gradually form. At present, it is still necessary to propose several concise formats for trial implementation. My personal opinion is that complex cases can be written in the form of a general summary report without listing "main text," "facts," and "reasons"; simple cases can adopt a tabular format, or only record the part of the judgment equivalent to the "main text."

    I think that some cases with extremely minor circumstances may not even require a written judgment. For example, a capitalist surnamed Wang in Beijing paid the relief fund in full after the Beijing Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau sent the case to the Municipal People's Court because he refused to pay the relief fund. The person in charge decided not to give him another criminal penalty, but only prepared to admonish him in court. Originally, once admonished, the case would be closed. But this person in charge insisted on writing a judgment, engraving it, stamping it, and sending it to Wang. This is obviously unnecessary.

    Only by resolutely eliminating "judicial stereotypes" can a new writing style appear in the People's Courts. Reforming judicial documents, facilitating the people, and improving work efficiency, especially today when judicial tasks are heavy, is an issue that people's judicial workers cannot ignore.

    关于改革判决书用语及格式的意见
    谢邦敏
    人民政府虽然早就明令废除了六法全书，但是直到今天，“司法八股”、六法术语还时常出现在人民司法机关的判决书上。它的为害，不但如五月二十一日人民日报读者来信栏邓庭焕所说：“……工农群众是看不懂的。有的农民为了弄明白判决内容，竟跑到几里外去找人解释”；而且，也曾唬住了不少文化程度较低或有一定文化程度、但没有学过六法全书的司法干部，使他们因感到“提笔写判太难”，而想“改行”。这不能不说是人民司法工作中的一个重要问题。
    我在北京市人民法院工作。对这种现象也常有感触。现在愿意提出以下革新司法文牍的意见，和大家研究。
    判决书是人民法院为某一案件向涉讼人及一般群众表明它处理结果的形式之一。因此，判决书应使人民了解案件是怎样处理的？为什么这样处理？好的判决书应该是事实明确，符合政策，并有充分的说服力。根据这个要求，判决书显然应该作到通俗易懂。要做到通俗易懂，最主要的是废除“司法八股”的文体。人民法院的判决书，应该用通行的语体文来写作。但目前的判决书中还充满了群众看不懂的文言文，甚至有些极其陈腐的语句。如：“予以”训诫、“要难卸责”、“空言主张”、“饰词狡展”、“灼然可见”、“昭然若揭”、“显不足采”、“查”、“经核”，等等。这些字眼群众既然看不懂，就不应该再沿用。判决书中词汇的取舍标准，只能是：大众语言中有的，大众可以听懂的，而且，上述词汇，如“显不足采”、“昭然若揭”等，是完全可以用语体文表达的。比如用“事情很明白”来代替“昭然若揭”，用“显然不正确”来代替“显不足采”。
    在反动政权下，借以迷惑人民和统治人民的法律术语，早就应该随着蒋介石反动政权的消灭而消灭了。在人民法律正在成长而尚未完备的时候，有成文法的，应该用自己法律中的术语。例如：尽可以依婚姻法称为“离婚”，而不必称为“婚姻离异”；双方便是“双方”，不必再称为“两造”。在成文法中没有但实际上需要的，尽可以写出本意来。如可以记为“本件应立即执行，不因一方声明上诉而中止”，不必再称为“假执行”；在具体案件中，宁可称为“合法的社会团体”，而不必再称为“法人”，等等。又如只为“内行”所了解，在判决书中又完全可以不用的六法全书术语，例如：“当事人不适格”、“诉讼标的”、“无因管理”等，也都不应该再沿用。
    在一件民事判决书内，如果必需记明双方的争论点时，也不必把原告提出的并无事实根据的请求写进去，这只要当庭对他解释明白就可以了。一件刑事判决书如果必需叙述犯罪事实，那也只应该写主要事实，不必把和量刑无关的情节都写进去。例如：在写一件判处恶霸案件的判决书时，只写出其罪行中具有代表性的一、二件，再概括地叙明类似的行为共有多少便够了，没有必要一一叙说。我曾见到一件大恶霸案件的判决书甚至把“将王姓的小鸡踏死”这样的细节也写上了，这是不需要的。就叙述一件犯罪事实来说，只需叙明行为人、被害人、时间、地点、重要过程（如手段等）和结果便够了，而不必按事实发生的每一过程一一写上。
    在格式方面，现在所沿用的“主文”、“事实”、“理由”分列的判决书格式，也是“司法八股”的躯壳。有了它，便免不了千篇一律地塞进去许多不必要的但足以迷乱人的文词。因此，我认为这种格式一般是可以废弃的。
    废弃了这种格式，也不必忙着设计别一种固定的形式来代替它。从实际工作中，根据不同的案情，不同的处理结果，大胆地创造与之相适应的格式，从而选择一种或数种格式，就会逐渐形成新型的判决书。目前，提出几个简明的格式试行，还是需要的。我个人的意见是，复杂的案件，可以不分列“主文”、“事实”、“理由”，而写成一般的总结报告的形式；简单案件则采用表格式，或仅记载相当于“主文”部分的判决书。
    我认为，有些情节极轻微的案件，甚至可以不写判决书。如北京市一个姓王的资本家，因为抗不交纳救济基金，经北京市人民政府劳动局送案到市人民法院，他就如数交纳了。承办人决定不另给他刑事处分，只准备当庭训诫。本来一经训诫，这案就了结了。但这位承办人偏偏又写了一份判决书，照例刻写、用印，发给王某。这显然是不必要的。
    坚决肃清“司法八股”，人民法院才有可能出现新的文风。革新司法文牍，便利人民，提高工作效率，特别是在司法任务繁重的今天，是人民司法工作者不可轻视的问题。
