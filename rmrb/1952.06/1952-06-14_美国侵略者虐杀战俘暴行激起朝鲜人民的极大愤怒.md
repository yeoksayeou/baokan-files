Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th (TASS): "Pravda" correspondent Dekashenko's Pyongyang dispatch writes: In the war-torn streets and squares of Pyongyang, there has never been a day in the past two months when it was as crowded as June 8th. People gathered in front of loudspeakers hanging on the broken walls, utility poles, and trees. On this day, Pyongyang Radio broadcast letters from Korean People's Army prisoners of war held on Geoje Island. People came to listen to the words of their sons and brothers living a miserable life in the hands of the Americans.

Dekashenko writes: In front of the loudspeaker on the large square in front of the Municipal People's Committee, a group of Pyongyang residents gathered. We also stepped forward. There were elderly people, women, and many young people and children. They were listening intently. Their eyes were flashing with anger. The atrocities of the American secret police shocked everyone.

People stayed in the square for a long time, and batches of people continued to pour in. People spontaneously held a rally. Piles of broken bricks and rubble around the square were used as a podium. Hundreds of people raised their hands: everyone demanded to speak, to express their feelings. Stonemason Jin Wanshui (transliteration) said: Hearing the letters from our sons and brothers suffering under the bloody prisoner policy of the United States, I couldn't help but shed tears. Our hearts are aching. But now I have no tears anymore, because the American murderers torture our prisoners of war and cruelly kill our patriotic people, the torch of hatred has burned away the tears.

We must all tell our brothers on Geoje Island that we have heard their calls, feel the same pain as them, and will do our best to save their lives and prevent them from being subjected to bloody persecution. I will engage in selfless labor in the industrial sector. If the motherland calls me to the front line, I will take up arms. In short, I will do my best to win the victory, defeat the aggressors, and liberate our brothers from the clutches of the American army.

Other Pyongyang residents spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously denounced the American aggressors and demanded that the American aggressors be handed over to the people's court for trial.

Dekashenko concluded by writing: In these days, the tide of popular anger against the heinous crimes committed by the American brutes on Geoje Island is surging. The Korean people have received thousands of letters and telegrams from the Soviet Union, China, various people's democracies, India, France, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries.

In their letters and telegrams, kind people all over the world unanimously expressed their support for the heroic Korean people who are waging a just liberation struggle, and expressed their determination to sanction the American masterminds and executors who committed the heinous crimes of waging bacteriological warfare in Korea and torturing and killing prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The letters and telegrams from foreign friends, as well as their sympathy and fraternal friendship, have encouraged the patriotic Korean people to redouble their efforts to fight for the freedom and independence of their motherland, and to fight for peace in the Far East and world peace.

    美国侵略者虐杀战俘暴行激起朝鲜人民的极大愤怒
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日电：“真理报”记者德卡诚科的平壤通讯写道：在满目战争创伤的平壤的街道与广场上，过去两个月来从来不曾有过像六月八日这样挤满了人群的日子。人们聚集在挂在残垣断壁、电线杆和树木上的扩音器前面。这一天，平壤电台广播了被囚禁在巨济岛上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员的来信。人们都前来倾听在美国人手中过着悲惨的俘虏生活的他们的儿子与兄弟们的话。
    德卡诚科写道：在市人民委员会前的大广场上的扩音器前面，聚集着一群平壤居民。我们也走上前去。这里面有老年人也有妇女，还有许多青年和儿童。他们在聚精会神地倾听。他们的眼睛都闪着愤怒的光，美国秘密警察的暴行使任何人都大为震惊。
    人们在广场上停留了很久，而一批批的人还在不断地涌来。人们自发地举行了一个大会。广场周围堆得高高的破砖残瓦就被当作讲台。成百上千的人举起手来：人人都要求讲话，要求表示他们的心情。石工金万水（译音）说：听到在美国血腥的俘虏政策下受难的我们的儿子与兄弟的信，我禁不住掉泪了。我们的心在发痛。不过现在我已经没有眼泪了，因为美国杀人犯用酷刑对待我们的被俘人员，残忍地杀戮我们的爱国志士，仇恨的火把泪烧干了。
    我们大家必须对在巨济岛上的我们的兄弟说，我们听到了他们的呼声，和他们同样感到痛苦难受，我们将尽我们最大的力量挽救他们的生命，不让他们受到血腥的迫害。我要在工业部门从事忘我的劳动，如果祖国召唤我上前线，我就拿起武器。总之，我要尽我最大的努力争取胜利，打败侵略者，把我们的兄弟从美国军队的魔掌中解放出来。
    其他平壤居民陆续在会上发言。他们一致痛斥美国侵略者，要求把美国侵略者交给人民法庭审讯。
    德卡诚科末了写道：这些天来，人民反对美国兽兵在巨济岛上犯的滔天罪行的怒潮，日益汹涌澎湃。朝鲜人民已接到千百封从苏联、中国、各人民民主国家、印度、法国、德意志民主共和国以及其他国家来的函电。
    全世界善良的人们在他们的函电中，一致表示声援正在进行正义的解放斗争的英雄的朝鲜人民，并表示决心制裁犯了在朝鲜进行细菌战和在巨济岛虐杀战俘的滔天罪行的美国主谋者和执行者。外国朋友的函电以及他们的同情和兄弟般的友爱鼓舞了朝鲜的爱国志士，促使他们加倍努力为争取祖国的自由和独立而奋斗，为争取远东和平与世界和平而奋斗。
