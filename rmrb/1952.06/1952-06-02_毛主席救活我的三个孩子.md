    Chairman Mao Saved My Three Children
    Editor: I am a mother of ten children. I deeply feel that children born in the era of Mao Zedong are the happiest. In January 1950, I gave birth to triplets, all girls. Because of excessive bleeding, I was physically weak and had no milk at all. The children's father (a tram worker) was very anxious looking at these three children. Just when my husband and I were most distressed, the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation sent comrades to express their sympathy and sent me and the three children to the Shanghai Municipal Maternal and Child Health Hospital. After I was discharged from the hospital, the three children remained in the health hospital, and the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation funded the hiring of a wet nurse to breastfeed them. Now they are supported by the China Welfare Institute for Children. They are all growing up plump, innocent and lively. Doctors regularly examine their bodies. I often think, if these three children were born in the old society, they would have died young. Their father often says, "We have these three children because of Chairman Mao. We will never forget the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party."

    毛主席救活我的三个孩子
    编辑同志：我是一个有十个孩子的母亲。我深深感觉到生长在毛泽东时代的儿童是最幸福的。一九五○年一月间，我一胎生了三个女孩，因为流血过多，身体虚弱，一点奶也没有。孩子的父亲（是一个电车工人）看着这三个孩子，心里非常焦急。正当我们夫妇两人最苦恼的时候，上海市民主妇女联合会派工作同志来慰问，并把我和三个小孩一同送进上海市立妇幼保健院。我出院以后，三个孩子仍留在保健院里，由上海市民主妇女联合会出资聘请奶姆哺养。现在他们又由中国儿童福利会扶养。他们都长得胖胖的，天真活泼。医生经常给他们检查身体。我时常这样想，这三个孩子要是在旧社会出生，一定要夭折了。她们的父亲也常常说：“有了毛主席，才有这三个孩子，毛主席、共产党的恩情我们是永远忘不了的。”            　程秀英
