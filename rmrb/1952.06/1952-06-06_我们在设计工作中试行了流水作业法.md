    We have Trialed Assembly Line Methods in Design Work
    Dai Nianci, Director of the Design Office of the Central Government Construction Office
    After the great "Three-Anti" Movement, the Design Office of the Central Government Construction Office carried out some reforms in labor organization according to the principles of the assembly line method. These reforms are just beginning, but the superiority of the new labor organization has been demonstrated in all aspects. In April, we exceeded our production plan for the first time in two years.
    Last year, Su Changyou, the creator of the segmented continuous bricklaying method, demonstrated his advanced operating methods here. The movement to learn Su Changyou's work method was launched successively at various sites. Design engineers were very interested in the assembly line method, but they also thought that design work is brain work, which is much more complex than bricklaying, plastering, and other work, and cannot adopt the mechanical assembly line method like manual laborers. Therefore, can the assembly line method be implemented? There were still doubts in the minds of many engineers.
    A Bundle of Handicraft Work Methods Prevented Us from Completing the Work Plan
    When summarizing the work of the past year, we found a serious problem. Over the past year, everyone has been working with enthusiasm and effort, some comrades often worked overtime, and we also tried to make monthly plans, but we could never complete them on time. Last year, we only completed three-quarters of the annual plan.
    Why are we so busy, but unable to complete the plan on time? After analysis, we discovered two characteristics of our work. First, we still used a bundle of handicraft methods to carry out our work. Most of us design workers (including some leaders) came from architectural firms in the past. Everyone is accustomed to working together in groups of a few or a dozen people (before liberation, an architectural firm of twenty or thirty people was considered very large). At that time, there were few people and the business was not complicated, so a bundle of small production methods in which one person or a few people did everything from beginning to end could still meet the needs of the time. Now, the situation has changed greatly. Our design office includes seventy or eighty members, the technical abilities of each member vary greatly, and the tasks undertaken are very heavy; however, we still use the old bundle of small production methods. For example, the architectural group still undertakes everything from contacting the client to making detailed construction drawings. How to change our working methods to make them suitable for current requirements has become a topic of conversation among comrades. Second, our work is often unable to be actively controlled due to objective constraints. For example, we must decide on the principles of construction and make sketches based on the opinions and requirements of the client; the client's opinions often change, and our work is often forced to stop or be reworked halfway.
    These two reasons made our work disorganized and unable to proceed according to plan.
    In the past, our organizational structure still followed the old one, divided into architectural, structural, and equipment groups. The task of the architectural group was the most complicated, involving the entire design work. The architectural group had to understand the situation from the client, draw sketches and modify sketches according to the client's requirements. Only after the sketches fully meet the client's requirements can the architectural group determine the detailed dimensions and practices of each part and hand them over to the structural and equipment groups for structural and equipment design work. The architectural group then continues to draw construction drawings and detailed drawings. After construction starts on site, the original designer must go to the site at any time to solve problems. This disorganized working method wastes labor and cannot guarantee the quality of work. Some comrades (especially those with less experience) are burdened with tasks beyond their own abilities and experience, so they often cannot do every stage of the work very carefully and meticulously. For example, when some comrades contact the client, they often do not fully understand the other party's requirements, so the design cannot fully meet the client's requirements. In this way, rework and waste often occur within a certain period of time. The work of the structural and equipment groups should have been proactive; however, they have to follow behind the architectural group, and their work is even more passive. Their drawing dates often fall behind the architectural group. Sometimes, when the work is urgent, the group leader or an experienced engineer will draw the drawings themselves, replacing the work that the trainees should be responsible for. In the case of our heavy basic construction tasks and insufficient design personnel, this waste of labor is completely unacceptable.
    Adjust the Organization to Implement the Assembly Line Method
    After discovering these problems, everyone began to consider solutions. Everyone believed that as long as the boundaries between the above two types of work are clearly divided, and the work that we can actively control is completely in our hands; according to the spirit of Su Changyou's work method, implement specialized division of labor, rationally arrange work procedures, and do a good job in each stage of the work, then our work situation will be greatly changed.
    We first separated the work that we can control from the work that we cannot control, and at the same time, tried to reduce changes from the client. We stipulated a new method: after the sketch design is completed, we sign a design contract with the client and charge a certain design fee. If the client wants to change the design contract, we will consider it as a new engineering task. This method prompts the client to go through a more detailed consideration when determining the sketch, signing, and paying, in order to make the final decision. In this way, after the sketch is determined, our work can be completely controlled by ourselves. On the other hand, we adjusted our organizational structure, changing the original architectural, structural, and equipment groups into six groups: business, sketch, architectural, structural, equipment, and survey; and according to the requirements of the work, we rationally allocated personnel and determined the tasks and work procedures of each group. When a design task comes, after it is handed down, the business group first understands the client's intentions and determines the construction base and the estimated budget. Then, the sketch group draws sketches according to the client's requirements. In order to make the sketch design work more thorough, the comrades in the sketch group should jointly determine the design principles with the personnel of the structural and equipment groups when drawing sketches. After the sketch is determined, the architectural, structural, and equipment groups simultaneously design construction drawings and detailed drawings. After the drawings are completed and construction starts on site, the survey group is responsible for contacting and understanding the site situation and solving general problems that occur on site. In the event of particularly important problems, the survey group will notify the original designer to solve them.
    The Superiority of the New Work Method
    In early April, we reformed the organizational structure, determined the work system, and began to implement the new work method. After the new work method was implemented, our work outlook immediately underwent significant changes. First, our production efficiency has greatly improved. The new work method absorbed the spirit of Su Changyou's work method and implemented a specialized division of labor system. Those who are suitable for making sketches specialize in making sketches; those who are suitable for determining the principle plan specialize in determining the principle plan; those who are suitable for calculating specialize in calculating; those who are suitable for drawing specialize in drawing. Everyone's expertise can be fully utilized. The work of each unit and each person has been simplified, which is conducive to improving technology and improving business. Due to the clear division of labor and each being responsible for their own duties, our own work is done more carefully and meticulously. As a result, our labor efficiency has greatly improved. We made a preliminary comparison between this year's several projects and the same type of projects last year that went relatively smoothly: the efficiency of architectural drawing work increased by 260%; the efficiency of structural calculation and drawing work increased by 170%. Last year, each square meter of architectural drawing required 0.13 work hours, and structural calculation and drawing required 0.16 work hours; this year, each square meter of architectural drawing only requires 0.03 work hours, and structural calculation and drawing only requires 0.059 work hours.
    Second, the new work method greatly shortened the design process. Now, after the sketch is determined, the architectural, structural, and equipment groups conduct design simultaneously according to the spirit of parallel operation. Each group also implemented the assembly line method within itself, which further improved labor efficiency. Because the sketch group absorbed the opinions of each group and considered issues more carefully when determining the sketch, there were very few changes after each group started designing. Now the structural group can generally issue drawings at the same time as the architectural group. The drawing time of the equipment group is also only one or two weeks later than the architectural group, which basically does not affect the construction on site.
    Third, the new work method strengthened the planning of our work. We not only divided labor according to the nature of the work, but also took into account the work procedures. Therefore, the work of each group is no longer as complicated and intertwined as in the past. With order in the work, we can actively grasp the progress, accurately estimate the strength of each part, calculate work efficiency, and formulate achievable work plans. The work in April has proved this. With a plan for the work and clear responsibilities for everyone, everyone's enthusiasm has been improved. In April, the architectural, structural, and equipment groups launched a labor competition for the first time, and everyone completed the work plan ahead of schedule.
    Fourth, the new work method strengthened everyone's overall concept. Now, anyone who wants to do their job well must cooperate closely with others. In this way, the achievements of the work are naturally regarded as the result of collective labor, and the individualistic "masterpiece thinking" is "useless." The strengthening of the overall concept has prepared favorable conditions for the standardization of our architectural design.
    The new work method enabled us to exceed our work plan for the first time in April this year. After the organizational structure was reformed in early April, the leadership assigned us the task of completing 30,000 square meters of design work in April (including the 16,000 square meters already in progress). At the beginning, some comrades lacked the confidence to complete this task. According to past experience, this was impossible. However, according to the new situation, after several discussions, everyone felt that not only could the plan be completed, but it was possible to do 10,000 square meters more. As a result, we did complete 40,000 square meters of design work.
    The new work method still has many shortcomings at present. For example, the strength allocation of each work stage is not balanced enough, so there are still idle labor phenomena sometimes; after the new division of labor method is implemented, some comrades are not very familiar with their own work; the division of work stages is not clear enough, and some work has become a "no man's land", and so on. In short, this new work method has just begun, and there are still many problems waiting for us to solve, and some shortcomings may not have been discovered today. But we believe that these problems can be solved in future work.
    Advancing in Criticizing Old Ideas
    Although the new work method is the creation of the masses, and the implementation of the new work method is also the requirement of the masses, many obstacles have been encountered during the trial implementation. Some comrades lacked confidence in this improvement, fearing that if the division of labor was not good, the scheduling was not good, and the assembly line operation could not be carried out, the entire situation would fail. Some comrades started from the individual, fearing that after the division of labor, they would specialize in one job, and they would not be able to learn other jobs, which is not as good as doing everything from beginning to end in the past, and they could learn everything. Some comrades lacked the mass viewpoint, did not trust others, and feared that after the assembly line method was implemented, other people's work would not be done well, which would affect their own work. Some people did not have enough enterprising spirit, fearing that after being transferred to a new job, they would not be able to do the new job well. Some comrades even started entirely from the individual, put forward many conditions, and said that they would only accept the new work task if their conditions were met; or hoped that they would be assigned to do the "big stroke" sketch work, not the rigid drawing work. Therefore, when determining the organizational form and allocating staff, some comrades were emotionally uneasy, suspected each other, and caused disunity. All these ideological problems have basically been overcome by us.
    The reason why we were able to overcome these obstacles should be attributed to the Party's education of us for more than two years. The Party has educated us to understand the question of "working for whom", and we have personally experienced that only the people's engineers are the most glorious. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, everyone further realized the serious harm of selfish and self-interested thoughts to revolutionary work. Therefore, in this improvement work, although some comrades were still burdened by old ideas, the old ideas could no longer stand. Everyone seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism of various incorrect ideas, and finally overcame them, and took a big step forward with full confidence.

    我们在设计工作中试行了流水作业法
    中直修建办事处设计室主任　戴念慈
    在伟大的“三反”运动以后，中直修建办事处设计室按照流水作业法的原则，在劳动组织方面进行了一些改革。这些改革还是刚刚开始，但是，新的劳动组织的优越性，已经从各方面表现出来了。四月份，我们第一次超额完成了生产计划，这是两年来所没有的。
    去年，分段连续砌砖法的创造者苏长有在我们这里表演了他的先进操作方法。学习苏长有工作法的运动，先后在各个现场开展起来。设计工程师们对流水作业法很感兴趣，但又想到设计工作是用脑子的工作，比砌砖、抹灰等工作复杂得多，不能像体力劳动者那样，采用机械的流水作业法。因此，到底能不能实行流水作业法？在许多工程师的思想上还有疑问。
    一揽子的手工业工作方式使我们无法完成工作计划
    在总结去年一年工作的时候，我们发现了一个严重问题。一年来，大家都是热情、努力地工作着，有些同志经常赶夜工，我们也曾试图逐月订出计划，但是总不能按时完成。去年，我们只完成了全年计划的四分之三。
    为什么工作很忙，而又不能按时完成计划呢？经过分析，我们发现了我们工作中的两个特点。第一，我们还采用着一揽子的手工业方式进行工作。我们这些设计工作者（包括一些领导人员在内），多半是从过去的建筑师事务所里出来的。大家都习惯于几个人或者十几个人（解放前，二、三十人的建筑师事务所就算是很大的了）在一起工作。那时候，人员既少，业务也不繁杂，一个人或几个人从头干到底的一揽子的小生产方式，还能适应当时的需要。现在，情况已经大大改变了。我们的设计室包括了七、八十个成员，各个成员的技术能力差别很大，而所担负的任务又十分繁重；但是，我们仍旧沿用着过去的一揽子的小生产方式。例如，建筑组从和委托者接洽开始，一直到做施工详图为止，还是一手包揽到底。如何改变我们的工作方式，使它能够适合于现在的要求，便成了同志们谈话的题目。第二，我们的工作因受客观条件的限制，常常不能主动地加以掌握。例如，我们必须根据委托人的意见和要求，决定兴建的原则并据以制作草图；委托人的意见常常改变，我们的工作也常常被迫停顿或中途翻工。
    这两个原因使我们的工作杂乱无章，无法按计划进行。
    过去，我们的组织机构仍旧是沿用旧的，分为建筑组、结构组和设备组三个部分。建筑组的任务最为复杂，它牵扯到整个的设计工作。建筑组要向委托人了解情况、根据委托人的要求，绘制草图和修改草图。直到草图完全合乎委托人的要求以后，建筑组才能定出各部分的详细尺寸和做法，交给结构组和设备组，由后者进行结构和设备的设计工作。建筑组则继续绘制施工图和详图。现场开工后，原设计人必须随时跑到现场去解决问题。这种杂乱无章的工作方式，既浪费劳动力，又不能保证工作的质量。有些同志（特别是经验较差的）担负的任务超过他自己的能力和经验，因此，常常不能把每个阶段的工作都做得很周到很细致。例如，有些同志和委托人接洽的时候，对于对方的要求，常常体会得不够，以致设计不能完全符合委托者的要求。这样，在一定时间内，常常发生翻工浪费现象。结构组和设备组的工作，本来应该是主动的；但是，他们要跟在建筑组的后面跑，他们的工作也就更被动了。他们的出图日期，常常落在建筑组的后面。有时工作催得急了，组长或者有经验的工程师就自己动手画图，代替了练习生应该担负的工作。在我们基本建设任务繁重，设计人员不足的情况下，这种浪费劳动力的情况，是完全不应该存在的。
    调整机构实行流水作业法
    发现了这些问题，大家开始考虑解决的办法。大家都认为，只要把上述两类工作的界线划分清楚，把自己能够主动支配的工作，完全掌握在自己手里；根据苏长有工作法的精神，实行专责分工，合理地安排工序，并把每个段落的工作都做好了，那末，我们的工作情况就会大大改变。
    我们首先把自己能够掌握的工作和不能掌握的工作分开，同时，设法减少来自委托者方面的变动。我们规定了一个新的办法：在草图设计完成后，我们和委托人签订设计合同，收取一定的设计费。如果委托人要改变设计合同，我们就作为新的工程任务重新考虑。这个办法，促使委托人在确定草图、签字付款时，必须经过比较详密的考虑，以便做出最后的决定。这样，在草图决定以后，我们的工作就完全能够由自己掌握了。另一方面，我们调整了自己的组织机构，把原来的建筑、结构、设备三组，改为业务、草图、建筑、结构、设备、查勘等六组；并根据工作的要求，合理地配备了人员，确定了各组的任务和工作程序。设计任务来了，交下以后，先由业务组了解委托者的意图，确定建筑基地及经费概算。接着，草图组根据委托者的要求绘制草图。为了使草图设计工作做得更加周到，草图组的同志在绘制草图时，要会同结构和设备组的人员，共同确定设计原则。草图确定后，建筑组、结构组和设备组，同时设计施工图和详图。图样完成、工地开工后，由查勘组负责联系了解现场情况，解决现场发生的一般性的问题。遇有特殊重要的问题，才由查勘组通知原设计人去解决。新工作法的优越性
    四月初，我们改革了组织机构，确定了工作制度，开始实行新工作法。新工作法实行后，我们的工作面貌立即有了显著的改变。第一，我们的生产效率大大提高了。新工作法吸取了苏长有工作法的精神，实行了专责分工制。适宜做草图的人就专做草图；适宜确定原则方案的人就专门确定原则方案；适宜计算的人专门计算；适宜绘图的人专门绘图。各个人的专长都能够充分发挥了。每个单位每个人员的工作都单纯化了，便于提高技术、改进业务了。由于分工明确，各负专责，我们自己的工作做得比较周密细致了。结果，我们的劳动效率大大提高了。我们把今年的几个工程和去年的同类型而且作得比较顺利的工程做了初步的比较：建筑制图工作的效率提高了百分之二百六十；结构计算和绘图工作的效率提高了百分之一百七十。去年，建筑图每平方公尺要用零点一三个工时，结构计算和绘图要用零点一六个工时；今年，建筑图每平方公尺只需要零点零三个工时，结构计算和绘图只用零点零五九个工时。
    第二，新工作法大大缩短了设计过程。现在，草图确定后，建筑、结构、设备三组，根据平行作业法的精神，同时进行设计。各个组还在自己内部实行了流水作业法，又提高了劳动效率。由于草图组确定草图时，吸取了各组的意见，考虑问题比较周到，因此，各组开始设计后，就很少再有变动了。现在结构组一般已经可以和建筑组同时出图。设备组出图时间，也只比建筑组迟一两星期，基本上不会影响现场的施工。
    第三，新工作法实行后，加强了我们工作的计划性。我们不仅是根据工作性质进行分工，同时还照顾了工作程序。因此，各组的工作再不像过去那样错综复杂地互相牵扯、互相影响了。工作有了秩序，就可以主动地掌握进度，准确地估计各部分的力量，计算工作效率，规定出可以实现的工作计划。四月份的工作已经证明了这一点。工作有了计划，每个人有了明确的职责，大家的积极性提高了，四月份，建筑、结构、设备三组，第一次展开了劳动竞赛，大家都提前完成了工作计划。
    第四，新工作法加强了大家的整体观念。现在，任何人要想把自己的工作做好，都必须和别人亲密合作。这样，工作的成绩很自然地就被认为是集体劳动的结果，个人主义的“杰作思想”已是“无用武之地”了。整体观念的加强，为我们建筑设计的规格化准备了有利的条件。
    新工作法使我们在今年四月份第一次超额完成了工作计划。四月初组织机构改革后，领导方面就给我们布置了任务，要求我们在四月份完成三万平方公尺的设计任务（包括已经进行的一万六千平方公尺）。开始，有些同志缺乏完成这个任务的信心。根据过去的经验，这是不可能的。可是，根据新的情况，进行了多次讨论以后，大家觉得不但能够完成计划，而且可能再多做一万平方公尺。结果，我们果然完成了四万平方公尺的设计工作。
    新工作法在目前还有不少的缺点。如各个工作段落的力量分配得不够平衡，因而，有时还发生窝工现象；实行了新的分工方法后，有些同志对本身的工作还不很熟悉；工作段落划分得还不够明确，有些工作成了“三不管”，等等。总之，这个新的工作方法还刚刚开始，还有不少问题等待我们解决，而有些缺点，可能在今天还没有被发现。但我们相信，这些问题在今后工作中都是可以获得解决的。在批判旧思想中前进
    虽然新工作法是群众的创造，实行新工作法，也是群众的要求，但在试行过程中，曾经遇到了很多障碍。有的同志对于这种改进信心不足，怕万一分工不好，调度不好，流水作业流不起来，就将全盘失败。有的同志从个人出发，怕分工以后，专做一门工作，别的工作就学不到，不如过去一手从头做到底，样样都能学会。有些同志缺乏群众观点，不信任别人，怕实行流水作业法后，别人的工作做得不好，影响了自己的工作。有的人进取精神不够，怕调到新的工作岗位后，做不好新的工作。有些同志甚至完全从个人出发，提出了很多条件，表示非要答应他的条件，才能接受新的工作任务；或者希望最好派自己做“大笔一挥”的草图工作，不要派去做死板的绘图工作。因而，在确定组织形式和分配工作人员时，有些同志曾经情绪不安，互相猜忌，闹不团结。这一切思想问题，基本上已被我们克服了。
    我们之所以能够克服这些障碍，应该归功于两年多以来党对我们的教育。党教育我们认识了“为谁工作”的问题，我们亲身体验到只有人民的工程师才是最光荣的。经过了“三反”运动，大家更进一步地认识了为个人打算的自私自利的思想对于革命工作的严重危害。因而，在这次改进工作中，部分同志虽然仍旧受旧思想的拖累，但是，旧思想已经站不住脚了。大家对各种不正确的思想认真地开展了批评与自我批评，终于战胜了它们，满怀信心地向前跨了一大步。
