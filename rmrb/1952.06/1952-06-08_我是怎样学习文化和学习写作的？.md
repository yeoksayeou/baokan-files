    How I Learned Literacy and Writing?
    Gao Yubao
    Editor's Note: In this article, Gao Yubao vividly describes his successful experiences in learning literacy and writing under the leadership of the Party with an indomitable fighting spirit, specifically proving that there are no insurmountable difficulties in front of working-class and peasant children with class consciousness. Gao Yubao's learning experience sets an example for the broad masses of workers and peasants to learn literacy, greatly encouraging their enthusiasm and confidence in learning.

    Dear comrades:
    Thank you for your encouragement regarding my book. My book is currently undergoing its second revision, and I plan to have the first half revised by next year. You all say you want to see my book sooner. Very well, I will work even harder, with the help of the Party and comrades from the General Political Department's Cultural Department, to revise the book as soon as possible to respond to your expectations and care.

    Dear comrades and comrades-in-arms: Your letters say "Gao Yubao is so and so glorious." Yes, it is glorious, but this glory belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao, because they cultivated and educated me. Think about it, if it weren't for the Party and Chairman Mao cultivating and educating me, could a poor child like me, who herded pigs and begged for food, have achieved what I have today?

    Your letters also say "Learn from me." I think I am nothing special. I am an ordinary soldier, and in the past I was an illiterate who didn't know a single character. The fact that I was able to learn literacy and write this book is entirely due to the strength of the Party and Chairman Mao. I often think like this: if it weren't for the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, if it weren't for the People's Liberation Army arriving in Northeast China, I would probably have died in the mines long ago. I am able to meet you all today, and I first thank the Party and Chairman Mao for the kindness of saving my life.

    Your letters ask me how I learned literacy and how I wrote the book. Dear comrades, mentioning learning literacy evokes my hatred for the old society. Let me first tell you about my past:

    I am from Sunjiatun, Taiping Village, Pingshan District, Fuxian County, Liaodong Province, Northeast China. My family was very poor. From the time I can remember, I lived a sad, animalistic life, suffering under the cruel oppression of the enemy, puppet government, traitors, landlords, and bullies. At that time, there was nothing to eat at home, and the Japanese devils and traitorous bullies still came every day to demand money and taxes. My father was beaten and punished for not being able to pay such heavy taxes, and there was even less money for me to go to school. When I was a child, I was very envious when I saw other children going to school, and I often ran home to beg my mother, "I want to go to school!" Because there was no money at home, she did not answer my request. As a child, not knowing my parents' feelings, I got angry and ran towards the school one time when my mother wouldn't let me go. My mother chased after me, chasing me for more than half a mile, and finally caught up with me on a riverbank. She hugged me and sat on the riverbank crying for a long time. Why was she crying like that? It was because in the old society, the family was poor and the child couldn't go to school. It wasn't just this one time that she was sad about my not being able to go to school. Thinking that I didn't want to make my mother sad for me, I never asked her to go to school again. When I saw the students, I felt anxious and sad, but I didn't let my parents know.

    One day, I and a dozen other children went up the mountain to collect grass and saw Mr. Zhou from the school leading a group of students on a trip. Those elementary school students were lined up in a neat formation, shouting "One, two, one," and walking very orderly. I felt both anxious and sad. In order to imitate their marching, I gathered the dozen or so children who were collecting grass and ran behind the elementary school students, also shouting "One, two, one." Mr. Zhou looked at me strangely. Seeing that I was smart, he went to my parents and asked them to let me go to school. My parents were afraid to let me go because there was no money at home. Mr. Zhou said that he didn't need my tuition, and he also had books, just that I needed to go. Only then did my parents agree to let me go to school. Who would have thought that after I had only been in school for more than a month, the traitorous head of the bao, Zhou Changan, saw me at school. He went to my house to demand tax money. My father didn't have any money to give him. He said, "You have money to send him to school, but you don't have money to pay taxes? This is official business, and it won't work if you don't give me the money today. If you really don't have any money, then have Yubao herd pigs for me, and I'll pay the tax for you." My parents had no choice but to ask me to herd pigs for the hellish head of the bao, and that's how I dropped out of school. One day, while I was herding pigs for the hellish head of the bao, I herded them to the entrance of the school where I used to study. Hearing the sound of the students reading, I remembered the kind Mr. Zhou and decided to go into the school to see him. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the school, the hellish head of the bao came. He beat me hard with his civilized cane and cursed, "You're eating from my bowl, so you have to be under my control. If the wolves eat some of the piglets, can you afford to pay for them? If I see you coming here to play again, I'll break your legs! This place isn't for you poor kids!" From that time on, I didn't dare to go to school again. When I was nine years old, my family could no longer maintain our livelihood. I went with my father to Dalian, where I attended school for another seven days. After that, I did odd jobs, worked as a laborer, became a conscripted laborer, learned carpentry..., and never went to school again.

    From a young age, I liked listening to stories. Wherever there were storytellers and those who told ancient tales, especially stories about riding horses, fighting battles, and chivalrous heroes, I would listen so intently that I wouldn't even want to eat. At night, when there were donkey shadow puppet shows in our area, I would often sneak out with my friends to listen, without my parents knowing. During those five or six years in Dalian, there was a storyteller in front of my uncle's house who told stories about the Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song Dynasties. I would go to listen at night, standing there until midnight without feeling tired.

    When I was seventeen years old (1943), the enemy puppet regime's rule in Northeast China became even more cruel. My grandfather, mother, uncle, and a younger brother all died in Dalian. My father and I could no longer stay in Dalian, so we returned to the countryside empty-handed. Life was even harder. There was nothing to eat at home, so we had to work as conscripted laborers again to exchange for a few measures of grain to support the family. When I was breaking rocks in Lingshan, my leg was crushed by a rock, and I couldn't move. Thinking of my father and younger brother at home, not knowing if they were alive or dead, I was very distressed. At this time, I saw the fellow workers reading novels, so I borrowed them to read. I had heard all the stories in those books, but I could only understand about 30% or 40% of the characters. I would ask the fellow workers about the characters I didn't understand. From that time on, I began to develop an interest in reading novels. Later, no matter where I worked, I would always borrow books to read if I could. After returning home, my father was sick in bed. In addition to working during the day and taking care of my father's illness at night, I would spend my free time reading under the oil lamp. My father often scolded me for wasting oil by reading at night, so I would cover the lamp with a piece of torn paper and read secretly. At this time, if a sentence had twenty-nine characters, as long as I could understand ten or so characters, I could half-guess and half-understand the meaning of that sentence. However, I still couldn't write.

    On November 19, 1947, Fuxian County was liberated.

    After liberation, my family was allocated land. In order to protect our home and land, and to avenge my unjustly deceased grandfather, mother, uncle, and younger brother, I joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In January 1948, I went to the front lines and joined the Communist Party. I served as a messenger, guard, military postman, and dispatcher in the army. For the first two years or so after joining the army, I still often read old novels. Whenever I received my allowance, I would buy a few to read. After reading them, I could even retell them. When marching, to reduce fatigue, everyone would ask me to tell them stories from the books. Comrade Chi Zhiyuan, the propaganda and education section chief of the regiment, in order to educate us, made a deal with me: he would have me tell a section from an old book, and then he would tell us a section from a new book. He told us all about the history of social development. What he told us was truly educational, and after that, I resolved to study hard. Because of marching and fighting, and the busy work, I only learned to write a little over a hundred characters, and I still couldn't write most of them.

    In August 1949, not long after Changsha was liberated, the troops were stationed north of Changsha. At that time, I was again serving as a military postman. I seized every opportunity to study literacy. The few characters I wrote each day were crooked and ugly. I filled a notebook with just a few "斗大" (dou da, as big as a peck measure, meaning large) characters, and I felt very frustrated. Seeing the children outside reading picture books, I borrowed the comic book "Young Mao Zedong" drawn by Comrade Mi Gu to read. The story of Chairman Mao's childhood studies moved me greatly, especially when I read these sentences: "When Chairman Mao was young, he liked to read old novels. One day, he suddenly had a question: why were the protagonists in the novels he read always civil officials and military generals, talented scholars and beautiful women, and he never saw a single farmer?" Yes, I had also read many old books and heard many stories, but why hadn't a poor person written a book? I thought about this for several days. I thought to myself: What's the use of reading those stories about civil officials and military generals flying over rooftops and scaling walls? The more I thought about it, the more I felt it wasn't right. I also remembered that the leaders had often educated me in the past that it was right to read new books, so I resolved to never read old books again from now on. I still had old books such as "Little Eight Heroes" by my side, and I had them all burned. From then on, I resolved to read more documents. Just then, the "Soldiers' Life" series published by the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army was distributed. As soon as I saw it, I thought happily: Ah? Isn't this a poor person's book? When I saw the protagonists in the book, the oppression they suffered, I associated myself with them, thinking, "I have suffered so much, shouldn't I write a book for my poor brothers to read?" Remembering the ferocious faces of the Japanese devils and those traitorous landlords, I hated them very much. Remembering my unjustly deceased grandfather, mother, uncle, younger brother, and those who suffered, I felt very sad. So I resolved to write a book. On August 27th, I ordered a notebook and began writing the book.

    However, my low level of literacy stumped me. After writing for two days, it was too difficult. I couldn't write 70% or 80% of the characters. I only wrote a few lines of "斗大" characters on the paper, and the characters were not like characters, crooked and ugly. The most "窝火" (wo huo, vexing) thing was that I couldn't write out what was in my heart. I thought a lot, but I wrote little on the tip of my pen. Sometimes the sentences I wrote weren't right. I put the pen on the table and thought to myself: Gao Yubao, you can't even write your own name well, yet you want to write a book. Isn't that a dream? Just then, the messenger of the Second Battalion of our regiment brought a manuscript and insisted on a receipt. I wrote the three characters "今收到" (jin shou dao, received today), but I couldn't write the character "稿" (gao, manuscript). In the end, I had no choice but to stamp it with the seal of the Propaganda and Education Section as a receipt. That comrade messenger was very unhappy, and I felt as if a knife had stabbed me. It wasn't the first time I had suffered from the pain of illiteracy. Remembering why I couldn't study in the past, it was like adding fuel to the fire, and I hated the old society. I also remembered Comrade Lenin's words: "Study, study, and study again." So I thought to myself: Learning literacy is also writing characters, and writing a book is also writing characters. Why not kill two birds with one stone? I'll write it out and let the poor brothers all over the country see it, let them remember the evil enemies, hold their guns tighter, liberate all of China, and build a beautiful new China in the future. If I can't write it well, I'll just use it as my own memoir diary, and use it as my goal for progress, recording the suffering of our workers and peasants in the old society. Reading it will give me the determination to seek liberation for all mankind, and I will be vigilant at all times, so I won't be like Li Chuangwang, who was overwhelmed by victory. I resolve to hold my gun tight and carry the revolution through to the end. I'll copy it and mail it home for my father and younger brother to read, so they can remember who our enemies are and who our benefactors are, so they don't forget their roots. Section Chief Chi of the Propaganda and Education Section saw that I was studying hard, and he encouraged and helped me even more. He personally ordered study notebooks for me and gave me pencils. He also asked Comrade Shan Qi, a propaganda and education officer, to teach me literacy. From that time on, Section Chief Chi and Officer Shan Qi became my teachers. I thought to myself: The leaders care so much about teaching me, I must study hard, so I don't let down the Party and the leaders. In order to respond to the education of the Party and the leaders, and in order to write a good book, I resolved: If I can't write this book in one year, I'll write it in two years. If I can't write it in two years, I'll write it in five years. If I can write the book in five years, then I'll have learned almost enough literacy. That's how I started writing the book.

    I had resolved to write for five years, but there were still many difficulties. Writing a book is not like learning literacy. You only need to learn a few characters a day when learning literacy, but you have to ask about every character when writing a book. When the section chief and officer were not at home, there was really no way to continue writing. Sometimes I got anxious, thinking: Forget it, how can an old roughneck like me write a book? Isn't this a joke? Thinking of the difficulties of being illiterate, I felt sad. At this time, I remembered the folk tale on "Soldiers' Life": "Grind an iron bar into a needle, success comes naturally with effort." I also remembered the difficulties of the 25,000-mile Long March that the leaders and comrades-in-arms had told me about, and the hardships of the three times descending south of the Yangtze and four times defending Linjiang in Northeast China. Thinking about it, I hadn't suffered those hardships since joining the army. I also thought: I haven't lowered my head in front of the enemy with thousands of soldiers and horses, how can I lower my head in front of the difficulties of literacy? No, I am a Communist Party member. If I lower my head in front of literacy, how can I complete the arduous tasks assigned to me by the Party in the future? I reviewed myself, then did some self-criticism, and then checked to see if I had achieved my resolution. Seeing that the five-year plan was still early, I quickly sat on the stool and continued to write.

    The section chief and officer were often not at home. In order to write the book as soon as possible, I thought of a way, ordering one large notebook and one small notebook. When the leaders were at home, I would write in the large notebook. When the leaders were not at home, I would write in the small notebook. I would draw some symbols to replace the characters I didn't know how to write. For example: I didn't know how to write the character "鬼" (gui, ghost) for Japanese devils, so I would draw a ghost face. I didn't know how to write the character "蒋" (Jiang) for Chiang Kai-shek, so I would draw a cartoon of Chiang's bald head. I didn't know how to write the character "群" (qun, group) for a group of things, so I would draw some small circles. I didn't know how to write the character "杀" (sha, kill), so I would draw a small person with a knife pressed against their neck... In addition to these, I had many other difficulties. Sometimes, I couldn't remember some things, and my head would hurt from thinking about them. I couldn't write well no matter how I wrote. I got so anxious that I was covered in sweat, walking back and forth in the room, and I couldn't even sleep at night. As soon as I remembered something, I would get up and write, no matter if it was day or night, midnight or not.

    When the troops set off to liberate Guangxi, I was serving as a military postman. In order for the troops to be able to read the newspapers and documents that day, and in order for the comrades-in-arms to receive their letters from home sooner, I would ride my horse an hour early every day to the division headquarters to get the newspapers, documents, and letters from home, and then wait for the troops on the road. As the troops passed one company, I would distribute them to one company, and I would have to distribute them all the way to the rear of the troops. I would use the remaining time to write the book. Because I left early and came back late, I had to feed the horse myself. I also used the time to feed the horse in the morning and evening to write the book. When chasing Bai Chongxi in Guangxi, the horse died while crossing the mountains. I carried my backpack and completed my tasks and continued writing the book.

    In December 1949, after Guangxi was liberated, the troops carried out bandit suppression. At that time, I had already written several drafts of my book. It was written as a ballad, with both singing and narration. Section Chief Chi and Comrade Shan Qi only knew that I was learning literacy, not that I was writing a book. One day, they asked me strangely: What are you writing every day? Only then did I tell them that I was writing a book. He took it and read it for a long time, and encouraged me happily, saying, "Very good, write it. Study the novel 'How the Steel Was Tempered' by the Soviet Union." I didn't know who the author of that novel was, so I asked him. Section Chief Chi told me the story of "How the Steel Was Tempered." He also said that the writer was blind, and how he worked hard to write the book. I was so moved after listening to it. I thought: If a blind person can write a book, then we who can see, although we are illiterate, can always write better than a blind person if we learn slowly. I was even more determined to write the book. After Section Chief Chi finished reading my manuscript, he instructed me, telling me how to write it, to write whatever I had. Comrade Shan Qi also agreed with his opinion. The two of them advised me that it was best to write it in the form of chapters and sections, so that things could be said more clearly. In order to encourage me to continue writing, Section Chief Chi wrote on my notebook: "Comrade Yubao: I hope you can continue to write it and write it like the novel 'How the Steel Was Tempered'." After listening to the leader's words, I began to rewrite it into chapters and sections. Section Chief Chi and Comrade Shan Qi taught me literacy every day, instructing me on how to write the manuscript. In a few days, all the leaders and comrades of the Political Department knew about it, and even our regimental commander knew about it. Everyone encouraged me to write well, and they gave me manuscript paper and pens. Section Chief Chi even carried my book on his horse.

    In February 1950, the troops went to Guangdong for production. In addition to participating in production, I would write the book whenever I had time. In June, I was transferred to the headquarters as a dispatcher. It was June weather, and the heat was oppressive. I lived in a small house belonging to a fellow villager. Outside the house was the fellow villager's kitchen. The small house was as hot as a steamer. There were many documents, and I was afraid of losing them, so I didn't dare to go out to cool off. I also heard that the troops were about to start learning literacy. I thought happily: "Write quickly, write it out so you can study literacy for three years." I was anxious, so I rushed to write day and night. My head already hurt from the heat, and adding the day and night writing, I had fainted several times. The regimental commander, section chief, and leaders of the Political Department often came to see me, encouraging me, comforting me, and telling me to write well. I had even more courage. At this time, the Korean War broke out. We were guarding the southern gate of the motherland. In order to strengthen vigilance and to prevent my personal writing from affecting my work, I thought to myself: Write it out quickly, so I can be ready to meet new tasks. So I rushed to write day and night, writing until two or three o'clock every night. I also asked clerk Shang Zhenfan to copy it for me. I wanted to copy a copy to mail home, and I would keep the original manuscript with me. If there were no changes, I would rewrite it. If there were changes, I would burn it. I wrote and learned every day like this, and my literacy improved every day. Before, I used drawings to represent the characters, but now I didn't have to draw anymore. I felt very depressed when I first started learning literacy and writing the book, but after writing for two months, I felt very interested and loved to write more and more. I even dreamed of writing the book and learning literacy. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the comrades of the leaders, after more than a year, I managed to write the first draft of a novel of two or three hundred thousand characters.

    You also asked in your letters what experience I have in writing books and learning literacy. I am just someone who has only recently started learning literacy and writing, and I really can't think of any experience. After thinking about it, I think there are probably these aspects:

    1.  Dig into it wholeheartedly. I remember an old saying among the common people, "Nothing is difficult in the world, it's just that people are afraid of having a mind for it." No one is born knowing everything. All skills depend on learning. The saying "Labor creates the world" is not false at all. If you can't dig into it wholeheartedly, and you can't overcome difficulties, then you can't do anything.

    2.  To be able to dig into it, you must have determination, perseverance, and use strong willpower to learn. I wrote the book based on determination. I think that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, no matter how great the difficulties, it is difficult to stop people with determination. A Communist Party member has no insurmountable difficulties. I am like this: When I encounter difficulties, when I don't want to write, when I don't want to learn, I check my determination, see if I have achieved my plan, and do some self-criticism.

    Dear comrades, criticism and self-criticism is really a good treasure, but you must also have the determination to use it. One person must be used as two people. This is how I use self-criticism. For example, if Gao Yubao is too lazy to learn literacy and doesn't want to learn, another Gao Yubao will stand up. He is a Party member, so he will stand on the position of a Party member and put the Gao Yubao who lacks determination aside, as the person being criticized, and criticize and review him: "Is it right not to learn literacy?" Then, the Gao Yubao without determination will stand on the position of a Party member to self-criticize. After Gao Yubao accepts the criticism, his determination to write the book and learn literacy will come again. If you don't accept criticism, then review yourself again: "You are a Party member, you shouldn't not study. You suffered in the old society and couldn't study. Today you have this good opportunity. If you don't study hard, can you be worthy of the Party? Can you be worthy of the people?" After reviewing yourself like this, the energy will come again. This is the method I used to write the book and learn literacy.

    Dear comrades, every comrade is either a Party member, a League member, or is determined to strive to be a good comrade who is a Party member or a League member. Our goal is to build a highly industrialized socialist and communist society. Now we want to build a strong and modern national defense army. Then we must be able to use new machines and modern weapons. It is impossible without literacy. Now the whole country and the whole army are vigorously carrying out literacy learning, and there is also the "Accelerated Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua. That thing is really useful, and you can learn hundreds of characters a day. We were people who could not study in the old society. Today we have this good opportunity. I hope everyone studies hard. If the study loosens up, I think we should all use the standards of Party members and League members to check and supervise ourselves, so that we can learn literacy well.

    I wrote this book, and I have improved my literacy. First of all, I thank the Party and Chairman Mao, thank the leaders above for their training, thank our regimental commander Sun Fengzhang and all the leaders of the headquarters for their encouragement in writing the manuscript, thank Section Chief Chi and Officer Shan Qi for their guidance in writing the book and teaching me literacy, thank clerk Shang Zhenfan for copying my manuscript, thank Comrade Huangcao for busily revising my manuscript and guiding me day and night, thank the dear comrades for encouraging me...

    My experience in writing books and learning literacy is these. However, to be a glorious national defense army fighter, my literacy is still not enough, my various aspects of knowledge are still very poor, and my book still has many shortcomings. I am still an elementary school student in writing books and learning literacy. I still need to study well, improve my literacy, and improve my various knowledge. I hope comrades will give me more help and education.

    Dear comrades, just like what you said in your letters: We must strive to learn literacy well, practice our skills well, master new machines and modern weapons, and build a new China and a strong national defense army! We are always ready to strike at the invaders! To complete this glorious task, I am willing to work with the comrades to study better and harder.

    Dear comrades, we must enthusiastically respond to the call of the leaders. For the construction of a strong national defense army and a great motherland, let us work together and move forward bravely in literacy learning!

    Finally, I wish the comrades progress in their studies and good health!

专栏：

    我是怎样学习文化和学习写作的？
    高玉宝
    编者按：高玉宝在这篇文章里，真切生动地描述了自己在党的领导下用不屈不挠的战斗精神学习文化、学习写作的成功经验，具体证明了在有阶级觉悟的工农子弟面前是没有不能克服的困难的。高玉宝的学习经验，给广大工农学习文化树立了一个榜样，极大地鼓舞了他们学习文化的热情和信心。亲爱的同志们：
    谢谢大家对我写书的鼓励。我的书是正在第二次修改中，计划明年把上半部改出来。大家说要早点看见我这本书，好吧，我要用更大的努力，在党和总政治部文化部同志们的帮助下，早点把书改好来回答同志们对我的盼望和关心。
    亲爱的同志和战友们：您们来信说“高玉宝怎样怎样光荣”。是的，是光荣，可是这个光荣是属于党和毛主席的，因为他培养了我和教育了我。想想，要是没有党和毛主席培养和教育我，像我这样给人家放过猪、要过饭的穷孩子，还能有今天吗？
    大家来信又说“向我学习”。我想，我并没有什么了不起的。我是一个普通的战士，过去是一个大字不识的文盲，我能学习文化写出这本书，这全是党和毛主席的力量。我常常这样想：要是没有党和毛主席的英明领导，要是没有人民解放军到东北，怕我早就死在矿山了。我今天能和大家见面，我首先感谢党和毛主席救命的恩情。
    大家来信问我，文化是怎样学的，书是怎样写的？亲爱的同志们，提起学文化，就会引起我痛恨旧社会来。我先讲讲我以前的经过吧：
    我是东北辽东省复县平山区太平村孙家屯人，我家很穷。从我能记事起，就过着伤心的牛马生活，受着敌伪汉奸、地主、恶霸的残酷压迫。那时家中没有什么吃的，日本鬼子和汉奸恶霸们还天天来要款、要税，我父亲因为拿不出那样重的税，挨过打，受过罚，家中更没有钱给我念书了。我小时见人家的孩子们在念书，非常眼红，常常跑回家去求母亲说：“我要念书！”因为家中没有钱，她没有答复我的要求。一个小孩子，不知父母的心情，母亲不叫我去，有一回，我气的向学校跑，母亲就在后面追，一直追出半里多路，在一个河沿上才追上我，她抱着我坐在河沿上整整哭了半天。她为什么这样哭呢，就因为在旧社会，家里穷，孩子不能去读书。她为我不能读书，不只难过这一回。我想不叫母亲替我难过，就再也没向母亲要求去念书，看见学生们，自己着急难过，也不叫父母知道。
    有一天我和十几个小朋友上山去拾草，看见学校的周先生带着一帮学生去旅行。那些小学生排着队伍，喊着“一二一”，走得非常整齐，我心中又着急又难过。为了学人家的步法，我把十几个拾草的小朋友集合起来，跑在小学生们的后面，我也喊“一二一”。那位周先生很奇怪的看着我，他见我聪明，就到我家问我父母，叫我去读书。父母因为家中没有钱，不敢叫我去，周先生说不要我的学费，书他也有，只叫人去就行了，父母才答应了我去读书。谁想我在学校才读了一个多月书，汉奸保长周长安到学校看见我了，他就到我家去要税钱，我父亲没有钱给他，他说：“有钱供大学堂，没有钱纳税？这是公事，今天不给钱可不行，要是真没有钱，就叫玉宝给我放猪去，那税钱我替你缴上。”父母没有办法，就叫我给阎王保长去放猪，我就这样失学了。有一天我给阎王保长放猪，放到我原来读书的那个学校门口，听见同学们读书的声音，又想起了好心的周老师来，就决定到学校里去看看他。不想我才进了学校，阎王保长来了，他用文明棍狠狠地打着我，又骂着我说：“你端我的碗，就得受我管，猪仔子要是叫狼吃了几个，你能赔得起吗？我再看你到这里来玩，把你腿给打断！这地方是你们穷小子来的吗？”从那时起，我没敢到学校去。我九岁那年，家中再也不能维持生活了，我跟父亲到大连，在那里又读过七天书，以后就做零工、当工人、出劳工、学木匠……，再也没念过书。
    我这人从小喜欢听故事，那里要有讲故事和说古书的，要是讲的骑马打仗、行侠仗义的故事，听得连饭都不想吃了；晚上我们那里有唱驴皮影戏的，我常常背着父母和小朋友们偷偷地跑去听。在大连那五六年，晚上我叔叔家门前有一个说书的，说的是隋唐五代和大宋的故事，晚上我就去听，站着听他半夜也不觉得累。
    我十七岁那年（一九四三年），敌伪在东北统治的更加残酷。我祖父、母亲、叔父和一个弟弟都死在大连。我们父子再没法住在大连了，又两手空空回到乡下。生活更苦了，家中一点吃的也没有，没办法只得再当劳工，换了几斗粮养家。我在灵山打石头的时候，腿被石头砸坏了，动弹不得，想起家中父亲弟弟不知死活，很是苦闷。这时我见工友们在那里看小说，我就向他们借来看，那书中的故事我全听过，书中的字我只能看懂十分之三、四，看不懂的字我就问问工友，从那时起才开始引起我读小说的兴趣。后来我不管在那里工作，能借到书，我总是借来看。回家以后，父亲病在炕上，我除了白天作工，晚上照顾父亲的病外，空下的时间就在油灯下看书。我父亲常骂我晚上看书费油，我就用一张破票遮住灯光，偷偷的看。这时候，一句话要有二十九个字，只要能看懂十来个字，我就半想半猜的知道那句话的意思了。可是，我还是不会写字。
    一九四七年十一月十九号，我们复县解放了。
    解放后，我们家中分了土地，为了保家保田，替屈死的爷爷、母亲、叔叔和弟弟报仇，我参加了中国人民解放军；一九四八年一月，到了前方，我参加了共产党。我在部队内当过通讯员、警卫员、军邮员和收发员。刚参军那两年多的时间，还是经常看旧小说，一发了津贴费，我就要买几本看，看了以后，还能把它讲出来。行军时，为了减少疲劳，大家叫我讲书给他们听。团宣教股长迟志远同志，为了教育我们，他就和我订出了交换条件：他叫我讲一段旧书，他就给我们讲一段新书，他讲的全是社会发展史。他讲那些东西，对我们教育可真大，以后，我决心要努力学习。因为行军打仗，工作又很忙，我只学会写一百多个字，大部分还不会写。
    一九四九年八月，长沙解放不久，部队住在长沙北面，那时我又当了军邮员。天天抓紧时间学习文化，一天写的那几个字，七弯八弓的真难看，斗大的字，几个就写了一本子，心中很苦闷。见外面小孩子们看连环图画，我借了米谷同志画的“少年毛泽东”的连环图画来看，毛主席幼年学习的故事，使我很受感动，特别是读到这几句话：“毛主席少年的时候很好看旧小说。有一天他忽然发生了一个疑问：他所读的小说中，主人翁为什么总是文臣武将，才子佳人，永远看不见一个耕田汉？”是呀，我也看了好多旧书，听了好多故事，为什么穷人没出一本书呢？我为这事整整想了好几天。我心想：看那些文臣武将，飞檐走壁的故事有什么用呢？越想越不是味。我又想起领导上过去经常教育我看新书是有道理的，就下决心从此以后再不看旧书了。我身边还有小八义等旧书，叫我全把它烧掉了。从此以后决心多看文件。正好，第二天，第四野战军政治部出版的“战士生活”丛书发下来了，我一看见它，心中高兴的想：啊？这不是穷人出书了吗？我看见了书中的主人公，受的那些压迫，联想起自己和他是一样，心想：“我受了那么多的苦，不好好写一本书叫穷哥们看看吗？”想起日本鬼子和那些汉奸地主的凶恶面孔，我非常痛恨；想起了屈死的爷爷、母亲、叔叔、弟弟和那些受难的人，心中非常难过。于是我就下决心写一本书。八月二十七日那天，我订了一个本子，就开始写书了。
    可是，文化水平低把我难住了。写了两天，实在太困难，十分之七、八的字都不会写。“斗大”的字在纸上只写了几行，字不像字，歪歪扭扭的真难看。最“窝火”的是心里的话写不出来，心里想的多，笔尖下写出来的少，有时写出的句子也不是个味道。我把笔向桌子上一放，心想：高玉宝，你连自己的名字都写不好，还想写书，这不是作梦吗？正在这时，我们团二营的通讯员送来一封稿子，他一定要收条。我写了“今收到”三个字，再写不出稿子那个“稿”字。最后我没有办法了，就给他盖了个宣教股的图章，当个收到条。那个通讯员同志很不高兴，我心里好像刀子刺的一样。我吃那没文化的苦不是一回了，想起过去为什么不能读书，真好像火上加油，就痛恨起旧社会来。我又想起列宁同志的话：“学习学习再学习，”于是我心里想：光学文化也是写字，写书也写字，何不两全其美呢？我把它写出来，叫全国的穷哥们看一看，叫他们记住万恶的敌人，枪杆子握的更紧，解放了全中国，将来好建设一个美满的新中国。要是写不好，就作为自己的回忆日记，拿它作为我前进的目标，记我们工农在旧社会受的苦，看了它，就会有了为全人类求解放的决心，时时刻刻的警惕着，再不会像李闯王那样，被胜利冲昏了头脑，决心握紧枪杆子，将革命进行到底。把它抄一份，邮家去给父亲和弟弟看看，叫他们好好记着，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的恩人，免得他们忘本。宣教股迟股长，看我用心学习，他更鼓励我和帮助我，他亲自给我订学习本，给我铅笔，他还叫宣教干事单奇同志，教我学文化。从这时起，迟股长和单奇干事就成了我的老师了。我想：首长们那样关心教我，我要不好好学习，就对不起党、首长们了。我为了回答党和首长对我的教育，为了写好书，我就下了决心：这书一年写不成，我写它两年，两年我写不成，我写它五年，在五年内书要是写出来，那文化也学得差不多了。我就这样开始写书了。
    写五年的决心是下了，可是困难还很多，写书不像学文化。学文化一天学上几个字就行了，写书什么字都要问。股长干事不在家，真就没有法向下写。我有时发急，想：算了，咱老粗那能写书呢？这不是笑话吗？想起没有文化的困难，自己伤心。这时我想起了“战士生活”上的民间故事：“铁梁磨绣针，功到自然成。”又想起了首长和战友们讲给我听的两万五千里长征的困难，和东北三下江南、四保临江的艰苦，再想想自己参军以来还没受过那些艰苦呢。我又想：在千军万马的敌人面前都没低过头，能在文化困难的面前低头吗？不，自己是个共产党员，要是在文化面前低了头，以后怎样再去完成党给我的艰巨任务呢？自己检讨了一下，再来了个自我批评，然后再查查决心实现了没有，一看五年计划还早呢，就忙坐在凳子上又写下去。
    股长、干事常常不在家。我为了早点把书写出来，就想了一个办法，订它一个大本子，一个小本子。首长们在家的时候，就在大本子上写，首长们不在家的时候，就在小本子上写，不会写的字，就画一些符号来代替。比方说：日本鬼子的“鬼”字不会写，我就画一个鬼脸；蒋介石那个“蒋”字不会写，我就画一个漫画上的蒋光头；一群东西那个“群”字不会写，我就画一些小圆圈；杀人的“杀” 字不会写，我就画一个小人脖子上按一把刀……。除这些以外，我还有很多困难，有时，有些事情想不起来，把脑袋都想疼了，这样写也不行，那样写也不好，急得满头大汗，在房子里走来走去，晚上连觉都睡不着。一下子想起来了，也不管是白天是晚上，是半夜，起来就写。
    部队出发解放广西，那时我正当军邮员，为了部队当天能看报纸和文件，为了战友们早点收到家信，我每天都是骑着马提前走一个钟头，到师部拿了报纸文件和家信，就在路上等部队，部队过一个连，我就发一个连，一直得发到部队后尾，剩下的时间我就写书。因为我提前出发，回来的又晚，那马就得自己喂，早晚喂马的时间也同样写书。在广西追击白崇禧的时候，过大山马卡死了，我背着背包也是同样完成了任务，也同样的写书。
    一九四九年十二月，广西解放后，部队进行剿匪，那时我的书已经写了好几回了。写的是大鼓书，有唱有白。迟股长和单奇同志只知道我学文化，不知我写书。有一天他二人很奇怪的问我：你天天写什么？我才告诉了他们是写书，他拿去看了半天，高兴的对我鼓励着说：“很好，写吧，学习学习苏联小说中的保尔·柯察金。”我不知道那本小说的作者是谁，我就问他，迟股长就给我讲起“钢铁是怎样炼成的”的故事来了。他又说那个作家是个瞎子，他怎样努力写书。我听了真感动的不得了，我想：人家是个瞎子都能写出书，我们一个睁眼的，虽然没有文化，慢慢学着写，总是比瞎子好的多吧。我更下定决心，非把书写出来不可。迟股长看完我的稿子以后，又指示我，叫我怎么写，有什么就写什么，单奇同志也同意他的意见。他二人劝我，最好用章回小说的形式写，事情可以说的更清楚。迟股长为了鼓励我写下去，就在我的本子上题了字：“玉宝同志：希望你能继续的写下去，把它写成像‘钢铁是怎样炼成的’小说一样。”我听了首长的话，开始改写成章回小说了。迟股长和单奇同志天天教给我文化，指示我写稿，不几天，全司政机关的首长和同志都知道了，连我们团长都知道了，大家全鼓励我好好写，又给我稿纸，又给我笔。迟股长还把我的书驮在他的马上。
    一九五○年二月，部队到广东生产，我除了参加生产外，有了时间我就写书。六月，我调到司令部当收发员。正是六月天气，暑气熏人，我住在一家老乡的小房里，房外就是老乡的厨房。小房里热的像蒸笼一样，文件又多，又怕丢失了，也不敢出去乘凉，又听说部队要开始学文化，我高兴的想：“快写，把它写出来好去学三年文化”，心中着急，就日夜赶写。本来天热头就痛，再加上白天黑夜赶写，就连着迷昏过好几次。团长、股长和司政机关的首长们常常来看我，鼓励我，安慰我，叫我好好写，我更有勇气了。这时朝鲜战争爆发了。我们是在守卫祖国的南大门，我为了加强警惕，怕自己私人写书的事影响了工作，心想：快点写出来，好再迎接新的任务。我就白天晚上赶写，每天晚上都写到两三点钟。又请文书尚振范同志代我抄，我想抄好一份邮回家去，底稿我还带着，没有情况我就改写，有了情况我就把它烧掉。我就这样天天写天天学，文化也天天提高了，以前我全是画画顶字，现在再也不用画了。我开始学文化和写书时非常苦闷，但写了两个月以后，就感觉着非常有兴趣，越写越爱写了。我连作梦都是写书和学文化，我在党和首长同志们的培养教育下，经过一年多的时间，算把二三十万字的小说初稿写成了。
    大家还来信问我写书和学习文化有什么经验，我是一个才学习文化、才学习写作的人，真想不出有什么经验来。我想了想，大概有这几方面：
    一、用心钻进去。我记得老百姓有句俗语“天下无难事，就怕有心人。”一个人没有生下来什么都会的，一切本领都靠着学习。“劳动创造世界”这句话，一点也不假呀。要是不能用心钻进去，不能克服困难，那是什么也作不出来的。
    二、要能钻进去，就得有决心，有恒心，要用坚强的毅力来学习。我写书就是凭着决心写的，我想在党和毛主席英明领导下，有天大的困难也难以挡住有决心的人。一个共产党员没有克服不了的困难。我是这样：遇到了困难，不想写了，不想学了，我就查查决心，看看计划实现了没有，来个自我批评。
    亲爱的同志们，批评和自我批评真是个好宝贝呀，可是，用它也得要有决心，一个人要当两个人用呀。我用自我批评的时候是这样，比方说高玉宝学文化又嫌麻烦了，不想学了，另一个高玉宝就站出来了，他是个党员，就站在党员的立场上把无决心的高玉宝放在旁边，当着受批评的人，批评检讨一顿：“不学文化对不对？”然后，无决心的高玉宝再站在党员的立场上来自我批评。高玉宝接受批评以后，他写书和学文化的决心又来了。如果不接受批评，再自我检讨一下：“自己是个党员，不应当不学习，从前在旧社会受苦不能读书，今天有这样机会，不好好学习，能对得起党吗？能对得起人民？”这样一检讨，劲头又来了。我写书和学文化就是用的这个办法。
    亲爱的同志们，每个同志不是党员、团员，就是决心争取作个党员、团员的好同志，我们的目标是要建设一个高度工业化的社会主义和共产主义社会，现在要建设一个强大的现代化的国防军，那么我们就要会用新机器和现代化的武器，没有文化是不行的。现在全国和全军正在轰轰烈烈的开展文化学习，又有祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”，那东西可真好用，一天能学好几百字。我们在旧社会是不能读书的人，今天有这个好机会，希望大家好好学习吧，如果学习松了劲，我想都应该用党员和团员的标准来检查督促自己，这样就能学习好文化的。
    我写出这本书，我提高了文化，首先感谢党和毛主席，感谢上级首长对我的培养，感谢我们团孙凤章团长和全体机关首长们对我写稿的鼓励，感谢迟股长和单奇干事对我写书的指导，教我学文化，感谢尚振范文书给我抄稿；感谢荒草同志日夜忙着给我改稿和指导，感谢亲爱的同志们对我鼓励………。
    我写书和学习文化的经验就是这些。不过，要作一个光荣的国防军战士，我的文化还是很不够的，我的各方面知识还很差，我写的书也还有很多缺点，我在写书和学习文化上还是一个小学生，我还需要很好的学习，提高文化，提高各种知识，我希望同志们给我更多的帮助和教育。
    亲爱的同志们，正像你们来信所说的：我们要努力学好文化，练好本领，掌握新机器和现代化的武器，建设好新中国和强大的国防军！随时准备打击侵略者！要完成这个光荣的任务，我愿意和同志们一起，更好地、更努力地来学习。
    亲爱的同志们，我们要热烈响应上级的号召，为了建设强大的国防军，和伟大的祖国，在文化学习上，让我们共同努力，勇敢前进吧！
    最后，祝同志们学习进步，身体健康！
