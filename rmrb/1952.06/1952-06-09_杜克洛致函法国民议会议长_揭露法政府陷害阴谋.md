Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th (TASS dispatch): "L'Humanité" published an abstract of Duclos's letter to the President of the French National Assembly, Herriot, on June 3rd. The newspaper stated: Duclos first pointed out in his letter that "the police, on the orders of the government, illegally arrested me in order to eliminate the leader of an opposition party using the methods adopted by Syngman Rhee in South Korea." Duclos then exposed the falsity of the report by police officer Vildavin, who arrested him. Duclos's car was always parked in front of the Communist Party Central Committee office building during the entire demonstration. How could Duclos's car have been seen "repeatedly near the Place de la République from 17:30 to 20:00"? Duclos wrote: "This report is a complete lie, a despicable police provocation. However, based on this report, they illegally arrested and imprisoned a representative elected by the people." Duclos concluded: "I am telling you these facts only because, with the Chief of Police and the Minister of Justice using these methods, no citizen can be guaranteed that they will not become a victim of conspiracy tomorrow, just as I am being accused by the government today and becoming a victim of this conspiracy. Therefore, I believe that for the supreme interests of democracy and peace, and for the salvation of France, this situation must be changed immediately and as quickly as possible."

    杜克洛致函法国民议会议长
    揭露法政府陷害阴谋
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎六日电：“人道报”摘要刊载杜克洛六月三日致法国国民议会议长赫里欧的信。该报说：杜克洛在信中首先指明，“警察奉政府之命把我非法逮捕，是为了用李承晚在南朝鲜采取的手段来除掉一个反对党的领袖。”接着杜克洛揭发了逮捕他的警官维尔达文的报告的虚伪性。整个游行期间杜克洛的汽车始终停在共产党中央委员会办公大楼前面，怎么能够“在十七点三十分至二十点在共和国广场附近屡次”看到杜克洛的汽车呢？杜克洛写道：“这个报告完全是扯谎，是卑鄙的警察挑衅。可是他们就根据这个报告，违法地把人民选出的代表逮捕下狱。”杜克洛在结语中写道：“我告诉你这些事实，只是因为在警察局长和司法部长使用这些手段的情况下，今后没有一个公民可以有保障明天不成为阴谋的牺牲者，像我今天被政府控告而成为这种阴谋的牺牲者一样。因此，我认为：为了民主与和平的最高利益，为了拯救法兰西，必须立即尽速改变这种情况。”
