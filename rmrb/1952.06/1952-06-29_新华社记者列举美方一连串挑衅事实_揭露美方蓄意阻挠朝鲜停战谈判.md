Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 28th: A special correspondent of this agency reports: The Korean War has entered its third year, and all indications inside and outside the Panmunjom armistice negotiation conference tent indicate that the US is attempting to sabotage the negotiations and expand the war. Inside the conference tent, US representatives are busy creating obstacles to obstruct the armistice, while outside the conference tent, the American aggressors are constantly carrying out despicable and shameless provocations.

The statements made by US Chief Representative Harrison in the past two days can help people understand the US conspiracy. He emphasized that "demands" are only effective when backed by military force. Now he is "demanding" that the Korean and Chinese side accept the US proposal to forcibly detain 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as a "final" suggestion. He said: Otherwise, "you will be wasting time and continue to suffer war losses." He also suggested an indefinite adjournment until the Korean and Chinese side accepts this demand.

It is clear that the "unenviable" job that Joy gave to Harrison is to desperately obstruct the realization of the Korean armistice. The US has created a series of provocations in the past two months in order to constantly create obstacles to an agreement.

This series of provocations is as follows:

	Saying that their proposal is "firm, final, and unchangeable," thereby refusing to negotiate at the conference table;
	Strafing Kaesong's airspace with machine guns and dropping twenty-five US Navy parachute flares for as long as fifty-five minutes;
	Suggesting indefinite adjournment every day, causing the negotiations to be interrupted;
	Bombing the Panmunjom conference site area, injuring three girls;
	Arrogantly and unilaterally declaring an adjournment, leaving the conference tent, causing the meeting to be interrupted;
	Deliberately ignoring the protests of the Korean and Chinese side, repeatedly killing and injuring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island and the Korean mainland;
	Carrying out bloody suppression of prisoners of war, taking prisoners of war to "solitary confinement," or moving prisoners of war to remote islands to prevent them from being dangerous witnesses to US crimes;
	Preparing to unilaterally hand over 27,000 Korean prisoners of war to their mortal enemy, the Syngman Rhee government.

The whole world has unanimously condemned the US "screening" as a violation of the Geneva Convention, but the US ignores all this, and regardless of repeated warnings not to detain prisoners of war, has resumed "screening" of 45,000 prisoners of war on Geoje Island.

The US has intensified its indiscriminate bombing of non-military targets on the Sino-Korean border, and US Far East Air Force Commander Weyland has even threatened with the words "There will be more in the future!"

This series of deliberate provocations inside and outside the conference tent is enough to prove that the US has no sincerity in the armistice negotiations and that they intend to sabotage the negotiations.

If the US representatives had abided by the promises they made at the administrative meeting of the staff meeting between the two sides in April, a fair and reasonable armistice agreement acceptable to both sides would have been reached long ago, and the Korean War would have ended two months ago. The compromise solution proposed by the Korean and Chinese representatives to break the deadlock on the prisoner of war issue is indeed fair and reasonable. According to the Geneva Convention, all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the US, British, and other foreign troops should be sent back to their hometowns and reunited with their families after the armistice. Korean prisoners of war whose hometowns are in the area held by the detaining side may be allowed to return home without repatriation. All other Korean prisoners of war should be sent home to live peaceful lives.

However, a fair armistice that is reasonable to both sides and acceptable to both sides is by no means what Washington wants. What the US government wants is to carry out political blackmail with the lives and suffering of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The price is that 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war will never see their motherland and families again, or the Korean War will continue and expand.

Before Clark and his American representatives lie two paths: either to continue to be battered and bruised in the face of the iron wall of the Korean and Chinese people's strength, or to accept the Korean and Chinese delegation's plan in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and achieve a fair armistice. The choice between these two paths is theirs.

    新华社记者列举美方一连串挑衅事实
    揭露美方蓄意阻挠朝鲜停战谈判
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜战争已进入第三个年头，而板门店停战谈判会议帐篷内外的一切征象都指明美方企图破坏谈判，扩大战争。在会议帐篷内，美方代表正在忙着制造阻挠停战的障碍，而在会议帐篷外，美国侵略者正在不断进行卑鄙无耻的挑衅。
    美方首席代表哈利逊在过去两天当中的发言可以帮助人们认识美方的阴谋。他强调说，只有在有军事力量做后盾的情况下，“要求”才有作用。现在他又要求朝中方面接受美方所提的强迫扣留十万朝中战俘的“最后”建议。他说：否则“你们将会浪费时间，继续遭受战争损失”。他又建议无限期休会，直到朝中方面接受这种要求时为止。
    很明显，乔埃丢给哈利逊的“无可羡慕”的职务是拚命阻挠朝鲜停战的实现。美方在过去两个月中之所以制造一连串的挑衅行为，是为了不断制造妨碍协议的障碍。
    这一连串挑衅行为是这样的：
    说他们所提的建议是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”，借此拒绝在会议桌旁进行谈判；
    在开城上空用机关枪扫射，并投下二十五枚美国海军降落伞照明弹达五十五分钟之久；
    天天建议无限期休会，使谈判中断；
    轰击板门店会址区，击伤三个女孩；
    骄横地片面宣布休会，离开会议帐篷，使会议中断；
    故意不理会朝中方面的抗议，一再杀伤巨济岛和朝鲜大陆上的朝中战俘；
    对战俘进行血腥的镇压，把战俘带去受“单独禁闭”，或把战俘迁到人迹罕至的岛上去，不让他们做美方罪行的危险证人；
    准备片面地把二万七千名朝鲜战俘交到他们的死敌李承晚政府手里。
    全世界都同声谴责美国的“甄别”是违反日内瓦公约的，但是美方不顾这一切，而且不顾再三再四提醒他们不要扣留战俘的警告，仍然在巨济岛上恢复了对四万五千战俘的“甄别”。
    美国已加紧对中朝边境非军事目标施行滥炸，而且美国远东空军司令威兰还以“今后还多着啦！”的话来威胁。
    会议帐篷内外这一系列的蓄意的挑衅行动，即足以证明美方对停战谈判没有诚意以及他们破坏谈判的用心了。
    如果美方代表恪守他们在四月份双方参谋会议的行政性会议上所作的诺言，对于双方都公平合理的停战协定早就已经达成，而朝鲜战争也在两个月以前就结束了。朝中代表为打破战俘问题僵局而提出的折衷解决方案，确是再公平再合理不过的了。根据日内瓦公约，所有中国人民志愿军、美、英及其他外国部队的被俘人员，在停战之后，都应被送回他们的故乡与家庭团聚。被俘朝鲜人而其家乡在扣留一方的地区者，可许其回家，不必遣返。其他所有朝鲜战俘都应遣送回家度和平生活。
    但是，一个对双方都合理而为双方所能接受的公平的停战，绝不是华盛顿方面所希望的。美国政府所希望的是以朝中战俘的生命与痛苦来进行政治讹诈。代价就是要十万朝中战俘再也看不见他们的祖国和家人，不然就继续并扩大朝鲜战争。
    在克拉克和他的美国代表们面前摆着的是两条道路：或者在朝中人民力量的铁壁面前继续碰得头破血流，或者按照日内瓦公约的规定接受朝中代表团的方案而实现公平的停战。在这两条道路之间，任他们选择好了。
