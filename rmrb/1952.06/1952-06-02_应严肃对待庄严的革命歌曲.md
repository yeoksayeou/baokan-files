A Short Commentary on Cultural Life

    Solemn Revolutionary Songs Should Be Treated Seriously
    Some organizations, groups, and schools often casually use records of American jazz music or other yellow songs to accompany dancing when holding social dance parties. When using a band for accompaniment, some units often use music intended for ceremonies in our country or brotherly nations as dance music. Both of these situations should be corrected.
    Jazz music and yellow songs are expressions of the decadent lives of the British and American bourgeoisie and the Chinese comprador class, decadent, sentimental, and erotic music designed to cater to the vulgar tastes of the petty bourgeoisie. Using this kind of music to accompany dancing will vulgarize beneficial cultural and social life, and its impropriety is obvious. Similarly, it is clearly extremely inappropriate to adapt solemn revolutionary songs used in ceremonies into social dance music or to play these songs while social dancing. In order to correct this phenomenon and avoid causing adverse political effects, the following songs must be strictly prohibited from being adapted into social dance music or played during social dancing: (1) National anthems of all countries and songs of all countries praising their motherland (such as "March of the Motherland," "Ode to the Motherland," etc.); (2) Songs praising revolutionary leaders (such as "The East is Red," "Ode to Stalin," etc.); (3) Party songs, League songs, and Pioneer songs of our country and brotherly countries (such as "The Internationale," "Song of the Communist Youth League," "Song of the Chinese Young Pioneers," etc.); (4) Various military songs of our country and brotherly countries (such as "March of the People's Liberation Army," "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention," "Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers," etc.). These pieces of music all have solemn political content, and it is obviously unserious and wrong to use them to accompany dancing. (It is also wrong for some circuses and acrobat troupes to play these songs in a glib manner to attract business, or for some bands to play these songs at weddings and funerals, or to adapt these songs into ditties to sing.)
    This matter should be brought to the serious attention of the cultural authorities of governments at all levels and music workers, and necessary measures should be taken to change the above situation. Local cultural administrative departments and music workers' associations should help and guide various agencies and bands to select appropriate social dance music. Music workers should write some healthy, cheerful dance music that can express the happy life of the Chinese people to meet the needs of the masses and improve the public's musical appreciation.

### 应严肃对待庄严的革命歌曲

    应严肃对待庄严的革命歌曲
    有些机关、团体、学校举行交际舞会时，常常随便用美国爵士音乐或其他黄色歌曲的唱片来伴奏舞蹈；在用乐队伴奏时，有些单位又常常把我国或兄弟国家举行典礼时用的乐曲用作伴舞音乐。这两种情况都是应该加以改正的。
    爵士音乐和黄色歌曲，是英美资产阶级和中国买办阶级的腐朽生活的表现，是为了迎合小市民层庸俗趣味的颓废、感伤、色情的音乐。用这种音乐伴奏跳舞，将使有益的文化社交生活庸俗化，其不妥当是很明显的；而把举行典礼时用的庄严的革命乐曲改编为交际舞曲，或在跳交际舞时演奏这些乐曲，也显然极不妥当。为了纠正这种现象，避免造成政治上的不良影响，必须严格规定下列歌曲不得改编为交际舞曲或在跳交际舞时演奏：（一）各国国歌及各国人民歌颂他们的祖国的歌曲（如“祖国进行曲”“歌唱祖国”等）；（二）歌颂革命领袖的歌曲（如“东方红”“斯大林颂”等）；（三）我国及各兄弟国家的党歌、团歌、队歌（如“国际歌”“少共团员之歌”“中国少年儿童队队歌”等）；（四）我国及兄弟国家的各种军歌（如“解放军进行曲”“三大纪律八项注意”“中国人民志愿军战歌”等）。这些乐曲都具有庄严的政治内容，如用这些乐曲伴舞，显然是不严肃的，错误的。（有些马戏团、杂技团用油腔滑调来吹奏这些乐曲以招揽生意；或有些乐队把这些乐曲拿来在举行婚丧的场合里吹奏；或把这些歌曲改编成小调来唱，也都是不对的。）
    这件事情，应该引起各级政府文化主管部门和音乐工作者的严重注意，并采取必要的措施改变上述的情况。各地文化行政部门和音乐工作者协会应该帮助和指导各机关、各乐队选择适宜的交际舞曲。音乐工作者应该写作一些健康、愉快，足以表现我国人民幸福生活的各种舞曲，以适应群众的需要，并提高群众的音乐鉴赏能力。
