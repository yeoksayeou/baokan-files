A Major Development in New China's Health and Healthcare Undertakings
Fu Lianzhang

The directive issued on June 27th by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, regarding the implementation of public-funded medical and preventative care for state personnel working in all levels of people's governments, party organizations, groups, and affiliated institutions throughout the country, is a major development in New China's health and healthcare undertakings. It is an important welfare measure reflecting the People's Government's concern for the health of state personnel, and yet another concrete manifestation of the superiority of our country's New Democratic political system. We express our heartfelt support for this decision.

We all know that Chairman Mao has always been deeply concerned about the health of the masses and has attached great importance to the development of the people's health cause. Throughout the arduous years of the revolutionary process, Chairman Mao has constantly instructed us to make the greatest efforts to carry out health work and ensure the health of the military and the people. After the nationwide liberation, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions to "unite all old, new, Chinese, and Western medical and health workers to form a solid united front and strive to develop the people's health work," and Article 48 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference regarding the promotion of health and medical undertakings, we have carried out a series of health construction projects. We have clearly put forward the three major work principles of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, prioritizing prevention, and uniting Chinese and Western medicine" among health departments and personnel as guidelines for action. We have established health grassroots organizations at all levels as the foundation for promoting health work and solving the health needs of the masses. We have vigorously promoted epidemic prevention work, improved environmental hygiene, curbed the spread of several of the most harmful infectious diseases in the past, and greatly reduced the incidence of general infectious diseases. We have carried out hospital rectification to better serve the people. We have reformed the medical education system to better suit the needs of national health construction. We have rapidly and massively trained health personnel at all levels to replenish the health workforce. Under the principle of self-reliance, we have carried out the production of medicinal materials, solving the needs for most medical supplies. All of these have created favorable conditions for the people's health and healthcare cause, and the implementation of public-funded medical and preventative care has developed on this basis.

The public-funded medical and preventative care measures have precedents in the old liberated areas. Not only have state personnel always enjoyed public-funded medical care, but poor people were also given free medical care as much as possible. After the nationwide liberation, due to various limitations, public-funded medical care was only implemented in some areas (such as disaster areas and epidemic areas), for some tasks (such as epidemic prevention), for certain personnel (such as those on supply system), and for the treatment of certain epidemic diseases (such as infectious diseases). After the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations in 1951, the medical problems of the vast number of workers in industrial and mining sectors were also resolved. In the same year, public-funded medical care was also piloted in the old revolutionary base areas of northern Shaanxi and some minority areas. This year, free medical care was further extended to all base areas of the Second Revolutionary Civil War. This time, based on the strength of the national health personnel and economic conditions, the scope of public-funded medical care will be extended in stages from July 1952 to state personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers working in all levels of people's governments, party organizations, labor unions, youth leagues, women's federations, various work teams, and cultural, educational, health, and economic construction institutions. This shows that the People's Government is very concerned about the people's health.

At present, our country's economic situation is only beginning to improve, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has not yet ended. In order to consolidate our victory and lay a solid foundation for a happy life in the future, we still need to accumulate a large amount of funds to focus on national defense and economic construction. Therefore, the implementation of some welfare undertakings can only be carried out gradually in a planned and step-by-step manner. Medical issues are related to the health of the broad masses of the people, and medical socialization is the goal we are striving for. However, public-funded medical care cannot yet be universally implemented among all the people. In addition to economic constraints, the number of medical personnel and the infrastructure of medical equipment, such as hospital and sanatorium beds, cannot meet all the needs at once. Therefore, this time public-funded medical care can only be extended to state personnel at all levels in stages, and their families and other personnel can only be resolved in the next step. Based on the number of beds, hospitalization should focus on emergency and severe cases. In order to better utilize the existing bed capacity and take care of the needs of emergency and severe cases, the Ministry of Health will formulate "Regulations on Hospitalization under Public-Funded Medical Care" for state personnel to comply with.

To accomplish this major task, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on the strength of national health institutions. We must unite private health institutions to work together, such as establishing joint public-private clinics or cooperating with private hospitals and clinics to sign health contracts so that they can share the medical tasks of state personnel. However, management should be strengthened, work efficiency should be improved, and potential strength should be brought into play.

After the implementation of public-funded medical and preventative care, we must better protect the health of the people and continue to implement the policy of prioritizing prevention. Medical treatment and prevention must be combined with each other, paying attention to hygiene, protecting health, and reducing the incidence of diseases. If we think that medical conditions are more convenient and we can relax prevention work, that is obviously contrary to the purpose of public-funded medical and preventative care.

The implementation of public-funded medical care is an arduous and heavy task for the health departments, but it is also a glorious and great task. We should understand the intention of the People's Government to care for the health of state personnel, and in the spirit of being responsible to the country and the people, correctly and satisfactorily complete this task. We must better carry forward the spirit of "healing the wounded, rescuing the dying, and practicing revolutionary humanitarianism," correct our medical style, and wholeheartedly serve to improve the health of the people. We must prevent the tendency of accommodating patients without principle, prescribing medicine casually, and admitting patients casually. We must also prevent the "attitude of condescension" -- treating patients sloppily because they do not pay for their own treatment.

Comrades of the state personnel! The Central People's Government has allocated a large amount of funds to run public-funded medical and preventative care in the current period of national recovery, which shows the great care of the Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao for our health. We should redouble our efforts, work hard, improve our work efficiency, improve our work style, wholeheartedly serve the people, fulfill our patriotic responsibilities in our own work positions, and make greater contributions to the people and the country, so as to promote our national defense construction, economic construction, and cultural construction.

    新中国卫生保健事业的一大发展
    傅连暲
    中央人民政府政务院六月二十七日颁布的关于全国各级人民政府、党派、团体及所属事业单位的国家工作人员实行公费医疗预防的指示，是新中国卫生保健事业的一大发展，是人民政府关心国家工作人员健康的一项重要的福利措施，是我国新民主主义政治制度的优越性的又一具体表现。我们对这一决定表示衷心的拥护。
    我们都知道，毛主席对人民大众的健康素来非常关心，对人民卫生事业的发展向极重视。在整个革命进程的艰苦岁月里，毛主席都曾不断指示我们要尽最大的努力来开展卫生工作，保障军民的健康。全国解放以后，根据毛主席“团结新老中西各部分医药卫生工作人员，组成巩固的统一战线，为开展人民卫生工作而奋斗”的指示，及中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第四十八条关于推广卫生医药事业的规定，我们更进行了一系列的卫生建设工作。我们在卫生部门卫生人员中明确提出了“面向工农兵，预防为主，团结中西医”三大工作原则，作为行动的准绳；建立了各级卫生基层组织，作为推动卫生工作解决群众卫生需要的基础；大力推行防疫工作，改善环境卫生，遏止了过去几种危害最大的传染病的流行，一般传染病也大为减少；进行了医院整顿，使之更好地为人民群众服务；改革了医学教育制度，使之更加切合国家卫生建设的需要；迅速地大量地培养各级卫生人员，充实卫生力量；在自力更生的原则下，进行了药材生产，解决了大部分医药用品的需要。所有这些，都给人民的卫生保健事业创设了有利的条件，公费医疗预防的实施就是在这个基础之上发展起来的。
    公费医疗预防的措施在老解放区早有先例，不但国家工作人员一向实行公费医疗，对一般贫苦老百姓也尽力予以免费医药照顾。全国解放以后，由于各种条件的限制，仅在部分地区（如灾区、疫区）、部分工作（如防疫）、某些人员（如供给制人员）、某些疫病医疗（如传染病）中实行公费医疗办法。一九五一年劳动保险条例颁布后，工矿部门广大职工的医疗问题也获得了解决。同年，在陕北老根据地和某些少数民族地区，也试行了公费医疗制。本年更将免费医疗扩大到第二次国内革命战争各根据地。这次，又根据国家卫生人员力量及经济条件，将公费医疗的范围，于一九五二年七月起，分期推广到全国各级人民政府、党派、工青妇等团体、各种工作队，以及文化、教育、卫生、经济建设等事业单位的国家工作人员和革命残废军人。这说明人民政府对人民健康是非常关心的。
    目前，我们国家的经济情况只是开始好转，抗美援朝的战争尚未结束，而为了巩固我们的胜利，并为了打下将来幸福生活的坚实基础，我们还需积累大量的资金，有重点地用之于国防建设和经济建设，因此对于一些福利事业的举办，只能是有计划的有步骤的逐渐实施。医药问题是关系广大人民健康的问题，医药社会化是我们奋斗的目标，但目前还不能在全体人民中普遍实施公费医疗。除了经济条件的限制以外，医务人员的数量、医疗设备的基础，如医院疗养院床位等，都还不能一下满足全部的需要。所以此次公费医疗只能分期推广到各级国家工作人员，至于他们的家属及其他人员，还只能留待下一步去解决。根据病床数量，在住院治疗方面又应以急症重症为收容重点。为了更好发挥现有床位效能，照顾急症重症的需要，中央卫生部将制订“公费医疗住院规定”，以便国家工作人员遵守。
    要完成这一重大任务，单靠国家卫生机构的力量是显然不够的，必须联合私营卫生机构共同努力，比如建立公私联合诊疗机构，或与私营医院、诊所合作，签订保健合同，使他们分担国家工作人员的医疗任务。但是应该加强管理，提高工作效率，发挥潜在力量。
    公费医疗预防实施后，我们要更好地保护人民的健康，要继续贯彻预防为主的方针。必须使医疗和预防互相结合起来，注意卫生，保护健康，减少发病率。如果以为医疗条件方便了，对预防工作就可以放松一些，那显然是与公费医疗预防的本旨相违背的。
    公费医疗的实施，对卫生部门是一项艰巨繁重的任务，但又是一项光荣伟大的任务。我们应该体会人民政府关心国家工作人员健康的意旨，本着对国家对人民负责的精神，来正确地圆满地完成这一任务。我们要更好地发扬“救死扶伤实行革命人道主义”的精神，端正我们的医务作风，全心全意为增进人民的健康服务。我们要防止无原则的迁就病人、随便投药、随便收容的偏向，也要防止“恩赐观点”——认为反正病人不花钱就对病人草率处理的态度。
    国家工作人员同志们！中央人民政府在目前国家还处于恢复时期的情况下拨出大笔经费来举办公费医疗预防，这是表示以毛主席为首的中央人民政府对于我们健康的极大关怀。我们应该百倍奋发，努力工作，提高我们的工作效率，改进我们的工作作风，全心全意为人民服务，在自己的工作岗位上尽到自己的爱国的责任，以期对人民对国家有更大的贡献，推动我们的国防建设、经济建设、文化建设向前迈进。
