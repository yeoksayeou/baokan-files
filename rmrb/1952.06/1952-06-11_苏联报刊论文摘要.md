    Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles
    More Widely Promote the Experiences of Production Innovators
    The Soviet magazine "Bolshevik" published an editorial in its seventh issue in April of this year on how to promote the experiences of production innovators. The abstract is as follows:
    Looking up to the advanced is a characteristic of socialist society, a natural and legitimate desire of the Soviet people to constantly move forward, and a manifestation of their constant concern for consolidating the power of the socialist motherland.
    Our advanced producers are helping to increase labor productivity to the level necessary for manufacturing abundant consumer goods and transitioning from socialism to communism. Guiding all workers to reach the level already achieved by advanced producers is one of the main potentials for further powerfully increasing socialist production.
    Supporting production innovators, earnestly helping them, and tirelessly caring about the promotion of their initiatives are the primary tasks of the Party, economic, and trade union organizations.
    Comrade Stalin once called socialist production competition a manifestation of the mass, professional, and revolutionary self-criticism. This self-criticism is not only manifested in the attendance of competitors at worker meetings and production meetings, exposing shortcomings in labor and production organization, and pointing out some ways to eliminate these shortcomings; it is primarily manifested in their criticizing shortcomings in production with their own work and experience. They criticize machine designers by improving machines and increasing their production efficiency; they criticize foremen and technicians by improving labor organization and changing and improving technical processes; they add Stakhanov workers' revisions to plans and point out the inherent potential for overfulfilling planned tasks, and they criticize economic leaders in this way.
    This mass, professional, revolutionary self-criticism, in an untiring struggle with all old and outdated things, promotes socialist production and opens up broad avenues for new and advanced things. But in order for this self-criticism to be fully unfolded, the participants in socialist production competition must be able to clearly see the results of their efforts, and any suggestion for improving operations must be able to immediately obtain practical support and widespread promotion.
    In our work of promoting the experience of innovators, there are still many instances of formalism and handcraft methods. If this work within the enterprise is organized in any way, the exchange of experience between enterprises is still done very unsatisfactorily. In addition, there are often leaders who stick to old ways and oppose the practices of Stakhanov workers. Their reasoning is this: as long as the plan can be completed and the factory can be well-received, why should we implement innovations that require reorganizing production and cause unnecessary trouble? The conservatism of these "lovers of leisurely life" brings harm to the interests of the Soviet state. We must stop this kind of practice and strive to ensure that economic organizations not only "approve" and "welcome" the initiatives of advanced individuals, but also systematically check how these initiatives are being promoted and how the innovators' suggestions are being adopted into production.
    The task of the Party organization is to constantly lead the work of trade union organizations, newspapers, radio stations, local publishing houses, and cultural and educational institutions, so that they use all their strength to publicize the achievements of advanced producers and adopt the experience of innovators in a planned and organized manner. In addition, the Party organization also needs to give special attention and care to strengthening and expanding the creative cooperation between scientific workers and producers.
    Comprehensivley studying and summarizing the experience of Stakhanov workers is of great significance in widely promoting the initiatives of production innovators. Engineering and technical personnel play a special role in this extremely important work. They should support the practices of Stakhanov workers with their engineers' calculations, summarize these practices, and formulate the conditions necessary for the large-scale adoption of these practices.

    Party Organizations Should Support and Promote Advanced Experience
    The Soviet magazine "Bolshevik" published an article in its seventh issue in April of this year by Gubkin, secretary of the Magnitogorsk City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), discussing some of the gains made by the Party organization of the Magnitogorsk Stalin Iron and Steel Combine in promoting advanced experience. The abstract is as follows:
    In our country, socialist production competition, courageous production initiatives and innovations have never reached such a scale as they have today. The more powerfully the initiatives of advanced individuals are supported by the Party and enhanced by political work, the faster they will become a mass phenomenon. This can be illustrated by the example of the Party organization of the first blast furnace workshop of the Magnitogorsk Stalin Iron and Steel Combine. The national movement of metallurgical workers to save money, reduce product costs, and maximize the use of production power was initiated here. When the initiators of the competition put forward this initiative, the workshop Party organization regarded this initiative as a matter of great national significance, and did its best to support and promote it. The workshop Party organization immediately convened a meeting of propagandists. After the meeting, the propagandists went to the various workshops. Steelworkers all participated in the discussion of the innovators' initiatives, and then undertook new socialist competition obligations. In this way, the Party organization of the first blast furnace workshop transformed the initiative of the workshop's steelworkers into a creative competition throughout the plant.
    In addition, the speeches of the initiators of the production competition in this workshop to the steelworkers of other blast furnaces also produced great results. Steelworkers and their assistants gathered in the red corner, and then the innovators talked to them about how to ensure good work, how to add flux, how to assign work to assistants during tapping, and how to save raw materials, etc. In this way, they enriched the listeners with advanced experience, helped them to better analyze and summarize their own work, and to better see their shortcomings. This method of exchanging experience strengthened the production friendship and mutual assistance of the steelworkers.
    The continuous growth of the creativity of workers and engineering and technical personnel places high demands on economic cadres and industrial leaders. Among them, the most important is that economic leaders and Party organizations can promptly pay attention to new things, clear the way for them, and make them the property of the masses.
    Economic leaders should be closer to the workers, consult their opinions more, and study their experience more carefully. Practice has proved that leaders who consult with workers and are good at relying on the collective always win; conversely, those who place their hopes on administrative means and only want to do a good job in sections and workshops by means of orders will always have trouble.
    In promoting creative initiatives, the workshop Party organization and the Party groups in teams and sections play an important role. Taking the Party group as an example, they work directly in the production sections among the workers. They are the first to perceive valuable production initiatives and can give them support and promotion before anyone else. Even a small initiative is important to pay attention to it and support it, because such small initiatives can often become the foundation of great undertakings.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    更广泛地推广生产革新者的经验
    今年四月份苏联“布尔什维克”杂志第七期发表如
    何推广生产革新者的经验的社论，摘要如下：
    向先进者看齐，是社会主义社会的特征，是苏联人要求不断前进的自然的正当的渴望，是他们对于巩固社会主义祖国的威力不断关怀的表现。
    我国先进的生产者们，正在帮助提高劳动生产率，使之达到制造丰富的消费品和由社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的水平。引导全体工人达到先进生产者所已达到的水平，是进一步有力地提高社会主义生产的主要潜力之一。
    支持生产革新者，认真地帮助他们，不倦地关怀推广他们的倡议，是党、经济和职工会组织的首要任务。
    斯大林同志曾把社会主义的生产竞赛称为群众业务性革命的自我批评的表现。这种自我批评不仅表现在竞赛者的出席工人会议和生产会议、揭发劳动和生产组织中的缺点、指出消灭这些缺点的一些途径等方面；它首先还表现在他们以自己的工作和经验批评生产中的缺点。他们以改进机器、增加其生产效率来批评机器设计师；以改善劳动组织，变更和改进技术过程来批评领班和技术员；他们把斯塔哈诺夫工作者的修正意见加入计划，并指出超额完成计划任务的内在潜力，他们以此来批评经济领导者们。
    这种群众业务性革命的自我批评，与所有旧的和陈腐的事物进行不倦的斗争，推动着社会主义的生产，为新的和先进的事物开辟了广阔的道路。但是为了要使这种自我批评能全力展开，就必须使社会主义生产竞赛的参加者们能够明显地看到他们努力的成果，就必须使任何一个改善业务的建议，能够立即获得实际的支持和广泛的推广。
    在我们推广革新者经验的工作中，仍存有不少的形式主义和手工业方式。如果说企业内部的这一工作无论如何总算组织起来了的话，那么企业之间的交换经验，则还做得十分不能令人满意。此外，常有这样的领导者，他们墨守旧规，反对斯塔哈诺夫工作者的实践。他们的理由是这样：只要计划能完成，工厂便可获得好评，那么何必要去实行那既需要改组生产，又会引起多余麻烦的革新呢。这种“悠然生活的爱好者们”的保守主义，为苏维埃国家的利益带来了损害。我们必需中止这类作法，努力使各个经济组织不仅“赞许”和“欢迎”先进者的倡议，而且要有步骤地检查这些倡议是怎样在被推广，检查革新者的建议是怎样被采用到了生产之中。
    党组织的任务，就是要经常领导工会组织、报刊、广播电台、地方出版社和文化教育机关的工作，使它们用全部力量来宣传先进生产者的成就，并有计划、有组织地采用革新者的经验。此外，党组织对于加强和扩大科学工作者和生产者之间的创造性合作，也需要给予特殊的注意和关怀。
    综合地研究和总结斯塔哈诺夫工作者的经验，在广泛推行生产革新者的倡议方面，具有重要的意义。在这一极端重要的工作中，工程技术工作人员们起着特别的作用。他们应当用他们的工程师的计算来支持斯塔哈诺夫工作者的实践，总结这些实践，并制订为大规模采用这些实践所必需的条件。
    党组织应支持和推广先进经验
    今年四月份苏联“布尔什维克”杂志第七期发表了联
    共（布）马格尼托哥尔斯克市委书记顾布金论述马格尼
    托哥尔斯克斯大林钢铁联合工厂的党组织在推广先进经
    验中的一些收获，摘要如下：
    在我国，社会主义的生产竞赛，勇敢的生产上的创举和革新，从没有达到像今天这样的规模。先进者的创举越是有力地为党所支持，为政治工作所增强，它也就会越快地成为群众性的东西。这可以由马格尼托哥尔斯克斯大林钢铁联合工厂第一鼓风炉车间的党组织的例子来说明。全国冶金工人争取节约、争取降低产品成本和最大限度地利用生产动力的运动，便是在这里发起的。当竞赛发起人提出这个创议时，车间党组织便把这一发起看做是具有巨大的国家意义的事，并尽力设法支持和推广它。车间党组织立即召集了鼓动员会议。会后，鼓动员到各车间去。炼钢工人们都参加讨论了革新者的倡议，然后承担了新的社会主义竞赛义务。这样，第一鼓风炉车间的党组织，便把车间炼钢工人的发起变成了全厂的创造性的竞赛。
    此外该车间的生产竞赛发起者对其他鼓风炉的炼钢工人的演说，也产生了很大的效果。炼钢工人和他们的助手集合于红角，然后由革新者向他们谈论如何保证做好工作，应该怎么加入溶剂，在出钢时如何给助手分配工作以及如何节省原料等经验。这样他们就以先进经验充实了听众，帮助他们更好地分析和总结自己的工作，更好地看出自己的缺点。这种交流经验的办法巩固了炼钢工人的生产友谊和互助。
    工人和工程技术人员创造积极性的不断增长，使党向经济干部们和工业的领导方面提出了高度要求。其中，最重要的便是使经济领导人和党组织能及时注意新事物，为它们扫清道路，并使它们成为群众的财产。
    经济领导者们应当更加靠近工人，更多地征询他们的意见，更注意地研究他们的经验。实践证明，凡是与工人商量并善于依靠集体的领导者，经常总会获得胜利；反之，如果把希望寄放在行政手段上，只想用命令的方式做好工段和车间工作的人，他的事情总是不顺利的。
    在发扬创造性的发起方面，车间的党组织，班和工段的党小组，起着重要的作用。如以党小组为例，他们就是在工人群众之中，直接在生产工段上工作的。他们比一切人都能先觉察到珍贵的生产发起，并能先给它以支持和推广。即使是一个不大的创议，但是注意它并给它以支持，还是重要的，因为这类很小的创议常常可以成为大事业的基础。
