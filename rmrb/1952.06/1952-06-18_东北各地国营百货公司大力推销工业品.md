    State-Owned Department Stores in Northeast China Vigorously Promote Industrial Products

    State-owned department stores in Northeast China are vigorously promoting industrial products to meet the needs of the people and create favorable conditions for the expanded reproduction of certain industries. The sales volume of various industrial products has now greatly increased compared to before. Taking various rubber shoes sold by state-owned department stores in Northeast China in April this year as an example, the sales volume in one month was 330,000 pairs more than the sales volume in the second quarter of 1951. In vast cities and villages, state-owned department stores, cooperatives, and other departments widely promote various rubber shoes. According to existing statistics, state-owned department stores alone supplied urban workers with 1,400 bicycles in late April. Workers in various factories in Qiqihar City bought 846 bicycles from state-owned department stores within 20 days. Cui Yongqing, a lathe operator from a factory, said: "With the prosperity of our national economy, the lives of our workers have also improved year by year. Hundreds of our workmates in our factory have each bought a new bicycle!" Currently, factory and mine workers in Songjiang, Anshan, and other places are successively placing large orders for bicycles with state-owned department stores.

    In the large-scale promotion of industrial products by state-owned department stores, resistance from certain conservative ideas was encountered. Some people said: "The plan is not small; it is already much larger than last year." This is because they did not see the changes in the market and the new demands of the people for state-owned trade. For example, the Heishan County Department Store initially proposed a plan to sell only 8,000 pairs of rubber shoes for the entire quarter, but later, after discussion by the sales staff, it was increased to 29,900 pairs. In fact, in the last ten days of April, the sales staff adopted the method of increasing sales booths on "market days" and sold more than 7,900 pairs of rubber shoes, which was about equal to the sales volume of the original quarterly plan. The Anshan City Department Store has recently supplied factory and mine workers with 1,000 bicycles. In rural areas, bicycles also have a wide market. These facts provide a powerful critique of certain conservative ideas among state-owned trade department personnel.

    State-owned department stores in Northeast China have adopted methods such as pre-order and consignment sales to facilitate the masses in expanding the promotion of bicycles and rubber shoes. (Li Jiyao)

    东北各地国营百货公司大力推销工业品
    东北区各地国营百货公司大力推销工业品，以满足人民的需要，并给某些工业扩大再生产创造有利条件。现在各种工业品的销售量比以前大大增加。以东北各地国营百货公司今年四月份销出的各种胶鞋为例，一个月的销量，比一九五一年第二季度的销量还多三十三万双。在广大城市和乡村，国营百货公司、合作社等部门广泛推销各式胶鞋。据已有的统计，各国营百货公司只在四月下旬供应城市职工的自行车就达一千四百辆。齐齐哈尔市各厂职工在二十天之内就从国营百货公司买去了八百四十六辆自行车。某厂车工崔永庆说：“随着我们国家经济的繁荣，我们工人的生活也逐年提高了。我们厂里就有几百名工友各自买了一辆新自行车！”现在，松江、鞍山等地的厂矿职工，正陆续向国营百货公司大量订购自行车。
    在国营百货公司大规模地推销工业品中，曾遇到了某些保守思想的抵抗。有的人说：“计划订得不小了，比起去年来已经大很多了。”这是因为他们没有看见市场上的变化，以及人民对于国营贸易的新要求。如黑山县百货公司开始时只提出全季度销售胶鞋八千双的计划，后来经过营业员讨论，才增至二万九千九百双。实际上在四月下旬十天之内，营业员们采取了“集日”增加推销摊子的办法，就销出胶鞋七千九百多双，约等于原来的季度计划的销量。鞍山市百货公司近来已供给厂矿工人自行车一千辆。在农村，自行车也有了广泛的销路。这些事实，给国营贸易部门人员的某些保守思想以有力的批判。
    东北各地国营百货公司在扩大推销自行车和胶鞋时，曾采取预约订货和寄售等方式，使群众得到方便。  （李继尧）
