The Danyang County Urban-Rural Products Exchange Conference provided a successful experience for other regions to continue expanding urban-rural products exchange.

Two Characteristics

The Danyang County Urban-Rural Products Exchange Conference was very successful, and it exhibited two characteristics:

One is that the conference transformed native product exchange into a widespread movement closely integrated with mass production and consumption. State-owned companies, farmers, urban and rural industrialists and merchants, urban and rural handicraftsmen, and people from all walks of life in the city directly participated in the conference. Producers and consumers met, the distance between producers and distributors was shortened, and the conference actively organized service stations and hostels to receive farmers. This conference made the vast majority of people generally aware from practical examples that urban-rural exchange is a major event that is closely related to everyone.

Another characteristic is that the conference adopted the original market fair format, carrying out short-distance exchanges of small-scale native products between cities and villages, districts and districts, and towns and towns, so that small-scale native products and handicrafts that originally had no way to be sold found a market. The market fair sold more than 30,000 pieces of small-scale native products, which increased the purchasing power of farmers, promoted greater prosperity for urban industry and commerce, and in turn invigorated the urban and rural economy.

Leadership's Emphasis is the Key to a Successful Conference

The conference was initiated by the Danyang County People's Government. Initially, various parties did not have sufficient understanding of the conference, and even some state-owned companies only focused on large-scale, long-distance sales of native products, believing that "short-distance exchange cannot solve the problems of state-owned companies." Therefore, they did not participate in the work during the preparation period of the conference and did not effectively exert the leading role of the state-owned economy. In particular, the department store did not set up a supply station at the venue from beginning to end. Urban and town industrialists and merchants believed that "exchange should be a big business, and our entry into the city is just to 'support' the urban industrial and commercial circles!" Therefore, some regional industrialists and merchants adopted a perfunctory attitude when ordering sales plans. Urban merchants believed that "exchange is a matter for handicraftsmen." Many farmers did not understand what "exchange" was, thinking it was "the city holding a conference."

However, the Danyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Danyang County People's Government, based on the current temporary stagnation of urban-rural exchange and the specific situation of the urban and rural economy in Danyang County, conducted research and believed that holding a successful urban-rural products exchange conference was an important link in breaking the economic stagnation. Therefore, County Chief Xue Xiaochun personally took charge, first educating the cadres of state-owned companies, and then convened an urban-rural exchange promotion meeting on May 14th and 15th, notifying various districts to order sales plans. This series of measures promoted the smooth opening of the conference.

Later, with the continuous enrichment and development of the conference content, the understanding of all sectors gradually improved. On the first day, many farmers entered the city to visit, and seeing many handicrafts being freely traded at the market fair, they brought their own by-products into the city to participate in the exchange on the second day, and finally brought seeds and agricultural tools into the city for exchange; for example, first it was urban areas and town industrialists and merchants who made a few deals, and later districts and districts, towns and towns all began trading; the conference was originally scheduled for two days, but later it could not be stopped, and it was extended for another day at the request of the industrial and commercial circles. Therefore, the entire process of the conference was also a process of improving the understanding of all sectors of the people, and the emphasis of the leadership was the key to a successful conference.

Resolved Several Issues in Urban-Rural Exchange

The conference exchange locations were concentrated on both sides of the street and in shops, with transactions taking place in three locations: market fair, exchange, and specially contracted purchasing points. More than a thousand kinds of goods at the exchange and market fair were automatically priced and specified by various industries, and the conference set up special agencies to inspect them. Exchanges mostly adopted cash-on-delivery transactions, and contracts were signed at the exchange, with a maximum of no more than twenty days. To date, most have been fulfilled. This exchange revolved around a central theme: to take care of the interests of producers, transporters, and sellers in urban and rural areas, and to solve several problems that had not been solved in past exchanges through various transaction methods:

(1) The vast majority of farmers and handicraftsmen directly participated in the exchange of products, improving urban-rural relations. Farmers and handicraftsmen directly exchanged products at the conference, and eventually some farmers even directly exchanged seeds and agricultural tools among themselves. Farmers with surplus seeds (including bean seeds and glutinous rice seeds) sold seeds and bought industrial products, and farmers lacking seeds purchased seeds at fair prices. This is actually a redistribution of the means of production among farmers, which has greatly supported agricultural production. At the same time, the conference also improved urban-rural relations. For example, in the past, farmers had to participate in the market fair in Xiaomaoshan County every spring, and they often suffered from private merchants suppressing prices and pickpockets stealing money; in this exchange, prices were unified, and the People's Government maintained law and order. Urban people sincerely organized tea stations, clinics, and bicycle parking places to serve the conference. Farmers generally changed their views on urban people. Many farmers reflected: "Such an exchange conference is beneficial to everyone, it can be held several times a year, and we will come again next time."

(2) Established new urban-rural commercial relations. Originally, industrialists and merchants in the urban area and towns of Danyang County did not communicate with each other. Shops in the urban area had a large backlog of goods that could not be sold, while town shops lacked industrial products. This problem was solved at this conference. For example, Lucheng District purchased more than 40 million yuan worth of silk and satin from the urban silk and satin industry, and other districts also purchased goods. Links were also established between districts and towns. For example, Fangxian District used to have to go to Yixing to buy lime, which cost a lot of round-trip freight and increased costs, while the lime produced in Lucheng District could not be sold. At this conference, the two districts signed an oral contract, solving the problems of both parties. Through this conference, urban and rural industry and commerce began to form an urban-rural exchange commercial network, creating conditions for carrying out product exchange in the peak season.

(3) Urban public and private enterprises promoted the sale of slow-moving products and overcame the off-season difficulties of private industry and commerce. After farmers sold their by-products, they needed a larger quantity of consumer goods. Therefore, the Danyang Office of the China Native Produce Company, whose original slow-moving goods such as watch core paper, vermicelli, dates (more than 70 dan), raincoats, brown sugar, and straw mats, were in short supply at the conference. Private industry and commerce, such as the silk and satin industry, sold out short silks less than five feet long, which had not been sold for several years. The business figures of various industries generally increased.

Emphasize Short-Distance Exchange of Small-Scale Native Products in Counties and Districts

Organizing short-distance exchange is a good way to promote the sale of small-scale native products. County and district native product exchanges should emphasize the exchange of small-scale native products, which is a new issue raised in this conference.

This time, the farmers and handicraftsmen participating in the market fair exchange included hundreds of kinds of agricultural by-products such as straw hats, straw ropes, brooms, bamboo products, small benches, and reed doors. The exchange figure for small-scale native products at the market fair reached more than 20 million yuan, accounting for nearly 40% of the sales. Scattered native products in rural areas account for a considerable number in the entire sideline product, but because it is only a small-scale native product, it is limited by cost and output, so it cannot be sold externally. However, failure to sell it will affect the lives and production of farmers. Therefore, striving for short-distance exchange within the county and district can solve this problem. For example, straw shoes in Lingkou District are the main sideline business of local farmers in the slack season. In the past, they could not be sold, but this time they were all sold out at 350 yuan a pair at the conference. These purchasing power that had not been discovered in the past can play a certain role in invigorating the social economy, and this successful experience should attract the attention of various regions.

Some Shortcomings of This Conference

Although the conference has achieved great success, it also has some shortcomings due to the lack of experience in holding such a conference. These shortcomings are mainly in two aspects:

(1) The conference preparation time did not achieve unified thinking and understanding among all parties, and the publicity and education work for the masses was not done enough. Farmers in some areas did not know about the conference and failed to enter the city to participate in the exchange.

(2) The conference's thinking on solving the problem of small-scale native products was not clear, so it focused on the wholesale transactions of the exchange and relaxed the control of the market fair. The close cooperation between the exchange and the market fair was not enough. The transaction results showed a large gap between the transaction figures of industrial products and native products. In the county as a whole, the problem of small-scale native products for farmers has not been greatly resolved. (Reprinted from Sunan Daily)

    丹阳县城乡物产交流大会的成就
    易乾
    丹阳县城乡物产交流大会，为各地继续扩大城乡物产交流提供了一个成功的经验。两个特点
    丹阳县这次城乡物产交流大会开得很成功，它表现出来的特点有两个：
    一个是大会把土产交流形成一个普遍地和群众生产、消费密切结合的运动。直接参加大会的有国营公司、农民、城乡工商业者、城乡手工业者和城市各界人民，生产者和消费者见面了，生产者和运销者距离缩短了，大会并积极组织服务站和招待所接待农民。这次大会使广大人民从实际事例中普遍认识到城乡交流是和每个人有切身关系的一件大事。
    还有一个特点是大会采用了原有的集场形式，开展了城与乡、区与区、镇与镇之间的小宗土产的短距离交流，使原来没有办法推销的小宗土产和手工业品找到了销路，集场销掉小宗土产三万多件，这样也就提高了农民的购买力，促使城市工商业更趋繁荣，进而活跃了城乡经济。
        领导方面重视是开好大会的关键
    大会是由丹阳县人民政府发起的。最初，各方面对这次大会都认识不足，甚至有些国营公司也只着重大宗远销的土产，认为：“短距离交流解决不了国营公司的问题。”因此在大会筹备期间，没有参加工作，没有很好发挥国营经济的领导作用。特别是百货公司，自始至终没有在会场设立供应站。市镇工商业者则认为：“交流要做大生意，我们进城不过是给城市工商界‘捧捧场’而已！”因此，部分地区的工商业者订购销计划时采取敷衍态度。城市商人则认为“交流是手工业的事”。很多农民不懂得什么是“交流”，以为是“城里开个大会。”
    但是，中共丹阳县委员会和丹阳县人民政府根据当前城乡交流暂时的呆滞和丹阳县城乡经济的具体情况进行了研究，认为开好城乡物产交流大会是打开经济呆滞局面的重要环节。因此，由薛晓春县长亲自掌握，首先向国营公司的干部进行教育，并在五月十四、十五两天召开城乡交流促进会议，通知各区订购销计划。这一连串的措施，促进了大会顺利开幕。
    以后，随着大会内容的不断充实和发展，各界的认识也逐步提高。第一天很多农民进城参观，看到集场上很多手工业品自由买卖，第二天他们就把自己的副产品带进城参加交流，最后把种籽、农具都带进城进行交换；再如起先是城区和市镇工商业者做了几笔生意，后来区与区、镇与镇都展开交易；大会原定时间两天，后来欲罢不能，应工商界要求又延长了一天。因此，整个大会进行的过程，也就是各界人民认识提高的过程，而领导的重视是开好大会的关键。
        解决了城乡交流中的几个问题
    大会交流地点是集中在街道两旁和商店里，分集场、交易所和特约收购处三处交易。交易所和集场千余种物品都由各行业自动订出统一价格和规格，大会设立专门机构进行检查。交流大都采取现款现货交易，交易所订有合同，最多也不超过二十天，到目前止，已大部履行。这次交流环绕着一个中心内容：就是为照顾城乡产、运、销三者的利益，通过各种交易方式来解决了过去交流中没有解决的几个问题：
        （一）广大农民和手工业者直接参加了物产交流，改善了城乡关系。农民和手工业者在大会上直接交流物产，最后甚至有些农民与农民之间以种籽、农具直接进行了交换。种籽（包括豆种和糯稻种）多余的农民卖出种籽，买进工业品，缺种的农民以公道的价格购进种籽。这就是实际上在农民之间调剂了生产资料的有无，对支持农业生产起了很大作用。同时大会也改善了城乡关系，如过去农民每到春季都要参加该县小茅山的集场交易，常有受私商压价，小偷扒手偷钱的情况；在这次交流中，统一了价格，人民政府又维持了治安，城市人民诚恳地组织茶水站、医疗所、寄车处等为大会服务，农民们普遍改变了对城里人的看法，很多农民反映：“这样的交流大会，对大家都有好处，一年可以多开几次，下次还要来。”
    （二）建立了新的城乡商业关系。原来丹阳县城区和乡镇的工商业者是互不通气的，城区商店积存了大批货品销不出去，而乡镇商店却缺少工业品，在这次会议上便解决了这个问题。如吕城区向城区绸布业购进的绸布值四千多万元，其他各区也购进货品。在各区镇之间也建立了联系，如访仙区，过去需要石灰要到宜兴去买，来往运费花费多，增加了成本，而吕城区产的石灰却销不掉，在这次会议上两区订了口头合同，把双方的问题都解决了。通过这次大会，城乡工商业开始组成一个城乡交流的商业网，为旺季开展物产交流创造了条件。
    （三）城市公私营企业推销了滞销物产，克服了私营工商业淡季困难。农民在卖出副产品后；需要较大数量的消费品，因此，中国土产公司丹阳办事处原来滞销的货品如表芯纸、粉丝、枣子（七十多担）、蓑衣、红糖、草席等，在大会上都供不应求，私营工商业如绸布业几年没有推销出去的五尺以下的短绸，这次也都销出，各行业营业数字普遍有了增加。
        重视县区小宗土产的短距离交流
    组织短距离交流是推销小宗土产的好办法。县区土产交流应该重视小宗土产的交流，这是这次大会中提出的新问题。
    这次农民和手工业者参加集场交流的有草帽、草绳、扫帚、竹器、小板凳、芦扉等几百种农业副产品，集场小宗土产的交流数字达二千多万元，推销近百分之四十。农村的零星土产在整个副业产品中占着相当数字，但因为它只是小宗土产，所以受成本限制，产量限制，是无法外销的，可是，不推销又要影响农民的生活和生产。因此争取在县区范围内作短距离交流，就可以解决这问题。如陵口区的草鞋是当地农民在农闲时的主要副业，过去无法推销，这次在大会上以三百五十元一双全部销完。这些过去没有被发掘的购买力，对活跃社会经济能起一定作用，这个成功的经验应该引起各地的重视。
        这次会议的一些缺点
    大会虽然已获得很大成绩，但是，由于对召开这样的大会还缺乏经验，因此也存在着一些缺点。这些缺点主要是两方面：
    （一）大会筹备时间没有做到统一各方面思想认识，对群众的宣传教育工作做得不够，有些地区的农民还不知道开大会，未能进城参加交流。
    （二）大会对解决小宗土产的思想不明确，因此重视交易所的整批交易，而放松了对集场的掌握，交易所和集场的密切配合不够，成交结果工业品和土特产品成交数字相距很远，以全县范围来说，解决农民小宗土产问题还不大。（转载苏南日报）
