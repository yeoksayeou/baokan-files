    Land Reform Exhibition Raised My Class Consciousness
    To the Editor: On May 25th, I visited the Land Reform Exhibition of Changsha Special District, Hunan, with a mentality of joining in the fun. But as soon as I entered the first exhibition room, my mood changed, and tears started streaming down my face. Here hung a tattered tent, which was used by four generations of the poor peasant Wang Guihua from Guquan Township, Liling County, for 120 years. Passed down to Wang Guihua, it had been patched countless times, serving as a blanket in winter and a tent in summer, busy all year round, until before the land reform. Next to the tent was a pile of torn cotton wadding, a quilt passed down through generations of the poor peasant Xiong Caichen from Matang Township, Xiangtan, used for 135 years. Opposite these items were the bedding items from a landlord in Liling County: a tent made of water-red silk, a Hunan-embroidered quilt, and an American blanket, which were worth a total of 150 piculs of grain. In another corner of the exhibition room, there were more than 20 kinds of wild grasses, the staple food that peasants often dug up to fill their hunger; while on the other side was a set of silver tableware belonging to the landlord, worth more than 90 piculs of grain.

    I will never forget the education this exhibition gave me. I was born into a poor peasant family, and my childhood was spent in suffering, hardship, hunger, and cold. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party came to my hometown, and I joined the revolution. Under the Party's guidance, I became a revolutionary cadre with certain working abilities over the past ten years. After the national liberation, I entered the city and was corrupted by bourgeois ideology. My lifestyle became extravagant. I yearned for the bourgeois way of life, and I deteriorated. The "Three-Anti" Movement rescued me from this mire. I thank the Party for leading me back onto the path of serving the people. This land reform exhibition has further raised my class consciousness. In the future, I will stand firm and be a resolute fighter in my revolutionary work.

### 土地改革展览会提高了我的阶级觉悟

    土地改革展览会提高了我的阶级觉悟
    编辑同志：五月二十五日，我带着一种凑热闹的心情去参观湖南长沙专区的土地改革展览会。走进第一间展览室，我的心情就不同了，热泪也淌下来了。这里挂着一顶破烂的帐子，这是醴陵县古泉乡贫农王桂华祖孙四代用过一百二十年的帐子，传到王桂华手中，千针万补，冬天当被子，夏天当帐子，一年四季都不闲，一直用到土地改革以前。在帐子的旁边，放着一堆破棉絮，那是湘潭麻塘乡贫农熊采臣祖上传下来的用过一百三十五年的被子。这些东西的对面，放着醴陵县一个地主床上的用品。一顶水红粉绸的帐子，一床湘绣的被子，一条美国毯子，这些东西一共值一百五十石谷子。展览室另一角的一边，陈列着二十多种野草，这是农民经常挖来充饥的口粮；而在另一边陈列的地主的一套银食器，价值就在九十石谷子以上。
    我永远忘不了这个展览会给我的教育。我是贫农出身，我的童年在受气受难、挨饿挨冻的日子里过去了。抗日战争时，共产党来到了我的家乡，我参加了革命。在党的培养下，十多年来，我成了一个有一定工作能力的革命干部。全国解放以后，我进了城市，受了资产阶级思想的腐蚀，我的生活气派大起来了。我向往着资产阶级的生活方式，我变质了。“三反”运动把我从这个泥坑里救了出来。我感谢党把我重新引上为人民服务的道路。这次土地改革展览会，更加提高了我的阶级觉悟。今后我一定站稳立场，在革命工作岗位上做一个坚毅不拔的战士。
