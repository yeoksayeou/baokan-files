China's cotton textile industry has begun to develop steadily forward due to the strong support of the People's Government, the continuous improvement of the production enthusiasm of the workers, the continuous creation of new work methods, and the improvement of the factory's own management after the "Five-Anti" campaign.

During the "Five-Anti" movement, various regions checked the actual amount of cotton used and the cost of labor and materials for spinning each piece of cotton yarn in various cotton mills. It was proved that private yarn mills had overcalculated the amount of raw cotton per piece of yarn when undertaking processing in the past. The state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, based on this old operating standard, generally paid the yarn mills for more raw cotton than was actually used when ordering processing. Private yarn mills had thus obtained considerable extra profits. On the factory side, although all factories had profits, the amount varied.

In order to change the unreasonable situation of calculating raw material usage in the past, further increase industrial profits, and vigorously promote the development of China's cotton textile industry, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council recently made a decision to adjust the amount of cotton used for processing and increase the standard of labor and materials in public and private cotton mills across the country. According to this decision, the amount of cotton used for processing each count of yarn shall be uniformly changed to 395 jin (municipal units) (except for sub-brand and combed yarn), with a cotton moisture content of 10% and an impurity content of 1%. Any excess or deficiency will be increased or deducted accordingly. At the same time, the labor and material costs for cotton yarn processing have generally increased compared to before the "Five-Anti" campaign. For example, the labor and material costs for each piece of 20-count grade A yarn have increased to 300 units in Shanghai (260 units before the "Five-Anti" campaign), 825 work points in Hankou, 315 units in Chongqing, 295 units in Xi'an (new), 290 units in Tianjin, 316 units in Shijiazhuang, 324 units in Taiyuan (new), and 325 units in Xinxiang (new). Other yarn counts have also increased proportionally. The above adjustment standards shall be implemented uniformly from June 1st.

Cotton yarn is a commodity purchased exclusively by the state, either through processing or ordering. During the "Five-Anti" movement, thanks to the correct leadership of the working class, the cotton textile industry in various regions implemented the policy of "not delaying production while carrying out the 'Five-Anti' campaign." Not only was normal production maintained, but the output of most yarn mills exceeded the level before the movement. The adjustment of raw material labor and material standards this time has made the profit of spinning more generous, which once again powerfully illustrates that the People's Government has always adopted a firm policy of supporting and developing industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All private cotton spinning factories should fully recognize the infinitely bright future ahead of them, and on the basis of eliminating the "five evils," further improve their business management, improve quality, reduce costs, and strive to further develop China's cotton textile industry.

In contrast to the situation in New China, the deepening economic crisis in the capitalist countries that threaten the world has forced the cotton textile industries of countries such as Britain, the United States, Belgium, and Japan to reduce production. Due to the stagnation of domestic and foreign sales, the cotton mills in these countries are in extreme difficulty. For example, the number of closed factories in Lancashire, the cotton yarn center of Britain, is increasing daily, and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs; Japan's monthly cotton yarn output has been reduced to 150,000 bales, equivalent to a 40% reduction in production. This forms the most obvious contrast between the cotton textile industries under the two systems.

### 我国棉纺工业生产稳步向前发展  与资本主义国家棉纺工业的萎缩状态迥然不同

    我国棉纺工业生产稳步向前发展
    与资本主义国家棉纺工业的萎缩状态迥然不同
    中国棉纺工业，由于人民政府的大力扶持，工人群众生产积极性不断提高，新工作法不断创造，工厂本身的经营管理在“五反”后也在改进，已开始稳步向前发展。
    各地在“五反”运动中，检查了各棉纺厂纺制每件棉纱实际用棉量和工缴成本的状况，证明过去私营纱厂在承受加工时，均多计算了件纱的原棉量；而国营花纱布公司根据这种旧的经营标准，在加工订货中付给各纱厂的原棉，普遍超过实际用量。私营纱厂曾因此获得不少的额外利润。在工厂方面，各厂虽均有盈余，但多寡不一。
    为了改变过去计算原料用量的不合理情况，并使工业利润进一步提高，大力促进中国棉纺业的发展起见，政务院财政经济委员会最近已作出调整全国各地公私营棉纺厂加工用棉量及提高工缴标准的决定。根据此项决定，各支纱每件加工用棉量，一律改为三九五市斤（副牌及精梳纱除外），棉花含水百分之十，含杂百分之一，超过或不足照数升扣。与此同时，棉纱加工工缴普遍较“五反”前提高。如二○支甲级纱每件加工工缴，上海增至三百单位（“五反”前为二百六十单位），汉口增至八百二十五工资分，重庆增至三百十五单位，西安增至二百九十五单位（新），天津增至二百九十单位，石家庄增至三百十六单位，太原增至三百二十四单位（新），新乡增至三百二十五单位（新），其他纱支亦按比例增加。上述调整标准，一律自六月一日起开始执行。
    棉纱是全部由国家统购的商品，非加工，即订货。各地棉纺业在“五反”运动中，由于工人阶级的正确领导，实行了“五反”和生产两不误的方针，不但保持了正常生产，而且绝大部分纱厂的产量，都超过运动前的水平。此次原料工缴标准的调整，使纺纱利润更为优厚，这就再一次有力地说明了人民政府对有利于国计民生的工商业，始终是采取坚决扶植和发展的方针。所有私营棉纺工厂，应该充分认识摆在自己面前的无限光明前途，在消除“五毒”的基础上，进一步改善经营管理、提高质量、降低成本，为进一步发展新中国的棉纺工业而奋斗。
    和新中国情况相反，由于威胁世界的资本主义国家的经济危机日见加重，已迫使英、美、比、日等国棉纺业生产日趋减缩。由于内、外销停滞，这些国家的棉纺厂都陷于极度困难中。如：英国棉纱中心兰开夏停工厂数日增，已有数万工人失业；日本棉纱月产量缩减至十五万包，等于缩减生产百分之四十。这就形成了两种制度下的棉纺业的最显明的对照。
