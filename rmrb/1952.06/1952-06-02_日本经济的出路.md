The Way Out for the Japanese Economy
Zhuang Tao

(I)
Under the long-term rule of the American occupiers and their lackey Yoshida government, the entire Japanese economy has been forced to serve the American war economy. This situation has made the lives of the Japanese people extremely impoverished and brought serious disasters to the Japanese business community. To say nothing of the distant past, in the less than two years since American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, the vast Japanese business community has tasted the bitterness to the full. Regarding this process, the Japanese bourgeois magazine "Diamond," published on February 21 this year, had a poignant description: "The ups and downs of the Japanese economy after the Korean War have been exceptionally drastic. In the half-year after the outbreak of the incident, business management rapidly improved, and a so-called profit inflation phenomenon appeared, which is already known to everyone. However, the life of this prosperity was too short. From the first half of 1951, the situation of the Japanese economy took a sharp turn for the worse. It suffered the first shock in April last year and the second shock in July. From last autumn, it experienced the third shock, and it is still caught in this vortex. The result is the bankruptcy of companies and businesses since last autumn." According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Labor, from July to September last year, an average of 268 applications for liquidation of enterprises were filed each month, an increase of 65 percent compared to the monthly average of 162 cases from January to March last year.

This wave of bankruptcies in the Japanese business community, which has been intensifying since last autumn, became even more violent last winter. The textile industry, which has become Japan's main export industry, was the first to suffer a heavy blow. According to the February 1 issue of the Japanese magazine "Economist," from last spring to November, 260 textile companies and businesses had gone bankrupt. In addition, the Japanese steel industry, which was once popular since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, is also in an unstable position. Last October, sales of ordinary steel materials in Japan fell from 16.47 billion yen in July to 11.406 billion yen, a reduction of one-third. As a result, the market prices of Japanese steel products have continued to fall since last autumn. Taking 1.6 mm thick thin steel plates as an example, the standard price of Yawata Iron & Steel Co. (Japan's largest state-owned steel company) in September last year was 75,000 yen per ton, but the market price was only 67,000 yen; at the end of October, when Yawata's standard price fell to 63,000 yen, the market price continued to fall rapidly, falling to 51,000 yen in early December, a decrease of 25 percent compared to last autumn. Since the beginning of this year, after the Japanese government restricted Japanese exports to the sterling area to alleviate the difficulties of sterling surplus, the difficulties of the Japanese steel industry have further increased. This increasing difficulty has been manifested in the surge in inventories. As of the end of February, Japan's inventory of ordinary steel materials had reached 600,000 tons, 240 percent of the inventory volume in June last year. Other peaceful industries are also becoming increasingly depressed under the influence of the violent wave of bankruptcies. Last November, the number of factories manufacturing soap in Japan decreased from 400 in the spring of last year to 263, and it is estimated that only 130 will be able to continue production in January this year.

(II)
This wave of bankruptcies appearing in Japanese industry and commerce is not accidental at all. This is the inevitable result of the United States rearming Japan and implementing its heinous policy of turning Japan into a colony and a military base for aggression against Asia.

Since the end of World War II, in order to achieve its goals of attacking China and the Soviet Union and replacing the former Japanese imperialism as the "master of Asia," American imperialism has been plotting to drag Japan onto the path of a new war of aggression since the beginning of its occupation of Japan. It vainly attempts to use the hands and blood of the Japanese people to establish its rule in Asia. Therefore, in recent years, the Japanese people have been forced to shoulder a huge rearmament budget. Taking the budget for 1952 as an example, the total amount is 852.7 billion yen, accounting for about one-fifth of Japan's national income of 4.5 trillion yen in 1951, an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year's budget (excluding last year's supplementary budget). Among them, the direct expenses for Japan's disguised army and navy - the "Police Reserve Force" and the "Maritime Safety Agency," etc. - are 202.2 billion yen, accounting for 23.7 percent of the total budget; secondly, the public works expenses, local financial balance payments, and price adjustment fees, which are mainly used for military construction and subsidizing military raw materials, total 280 billion yen, accounting for 33 percent of the total budget. This huge war budget has a great impact on the Japanese economy, which is currently in a state of stagnation. Even Sadakazu Kawatkita, manager of the Industrial Bank of Japan, worriedly said: "It is entirely predictable that the fiscal scale of 850 billion yen in 1952 will give considerable pressure to the national economy." (January 1 issue of the Japanese magazine "Economist")

Not only that, American imperialism is also using its occupation system in Japan to monopolize the Japanese economy and carry out cruel enslavement and exploitation of the Japanese people. According to figures released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the Foreign Investment Committee, the total amount of investment by the US government and American capitalists in basic industrial sectors such as Japanese railways, telecommunications, electric power, shipping, steel, and coal mines has reached 320 billion yen, equivalent to the total amount of paid-in capital of Japanese joint-stock companies nationwide. Among them, 280 billion yen, accounting for 90 percent of the total investment, is invested in the form of "counterpart funds for US aid." That is, the United States reinvests the yen funds obtained from selling surplus commodities such as cotton and wheat in Japan at high prices into the Japanese industrial sector to achieve its dual purpose: both alleviating its own economic panic and controlling the Japanese economy. In this way, food and cotton have become the main imports of Japan after the war. In 1951, Japan's imports of food and cotton totaled 1.017 billion US dollars, accounting for 65 percent of the total imports, of which 64 percent came from the dollar area, mainly the United States. This not only destroyed Japan's industry, making it lose its independence and autonomy, but also seriously damaged Japanese agriculture.

In order to monopolize the Japanese economy and further turn Japan into a Far East factory for its aggression against Southeast Asia, American imperialism further cut off Japan's economic ties with the main Asian regions, mainly China, forcing Japan to transport expensive raw materials from the United States for production, and then transport the manufactured goods to the Southeast Asian market for sale. Due to the lack of ships in Japan after the war, 80 percent of these transports were mainly completed by renting American ships at high prices. This approach obviously completely violates the principle of cost accounting and also makes Japanese industrialists unprofitable. A well-known Japanese economist, Professor Kazuyoshi Nawa of Osaka Commercial University, wrote in the December 21 issue of the Japanese magazine "Economist" last year: "A large amount of cheap, strongly cohesive coal (raw material for coking), iron ore, and soybeans that could have been purchased from the CCP are now imported from the dollar area at high prices. If imported from the CCP, coal would be $17 per ton, now it is $28 or $29; iron ore would be $13, now it is $24 to $27; soybeans would be $100, now it is $165. This alone has increased Japan's economic dependence on the dollar, increased the prices of Japanese steel and machinery, and significantly weakened Japan's export capacity."

Due to the above reasons, Japan's industry and foreign trade have not been able to achieve normal development for a long time after the war. In 1950, Japan's foreign trade was only one-third of the average volume from 1934 to 1936. The partial recovery of Japan's military industry and export industry after the war was mainly not relying on its own capital accumulation, but was carried out under massive subsidies from the national treasury. In 1949, 70 percent of the production cost of each ton of pig iron in Japan was taken from the national treasury subsidies accumulated by the blood and sweat of the Japanese people. According to a survey by the Japanese "Toyo Keizai Shimpo" at the end of September 1951, the export price of 20-count cotton yarn per pound in Japan was 11 percent lower than the domestic price. This has made the Japanese economy suffer even heavier oppression.

The United States' rearming of Japan, carrying out cruel enslavement and exploitation of Japan, driving Japan onto the path of developing war industries, and cutting off Japan's economic ties with the main Asian regions, mainly China, have left the Japanese economy in a dying state. The Japanese working people cannot but be forced to struggle on the brink of starvation. According to a survey by the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, in June 1949, the real wages of Japanese workers had fallen to 40 percent of those in 1937. In the year after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the real wages of Japanese workers continued to be forced to decrease, the average price of general consumer goods rose by 50 percent, but the nominal wages of workers only rose by an average of 9 percent.

The situation in Japanese rural areas is even more tragic. In 1948, the taxes borne by Japanese farmers averaged 35.9 percent of their cash income. In addition, the American grain subsidized by the Japanese national treasury filled the Japanese market, and the Japanese government forcibly purchased farmers' grain at prices lower than the production cost, which made the general farmers heavily indebted. According to a survey by the Japan Agricultural and Forestry Central Bank, the loans owed by Japanese farmers to official cooperatives and the Agricultural and Forestry Central Bank alone had reached 14.4 billion yen as of September 1950, and further increased to 18.7 billion yen by September 1951, an increase of nearly 30 percent in one year. This situation has caused the exodus of the rural population and the abandonment of cultivated land in Japan. According to the 1952 "Yomiuri Yearbook of Japan," the cultivated area of rice, which is the main food of the Japanese people, has decreased from 3.9 million cho (1 cho is approximately equivalent to 1 hectare) in 1945 to 3 million cho in 1950, a reduction of 24 percent in five years.

The Japanese business community, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, is also in a similarly painful situation. In 1950, the asset income part of Japan's national income accounted for only 3.5 percent of the total income, while in 1934 to 1936, it averaged 21.6 percent. From this, it can be seen how surprisingly reduced the asset income, which is the most important source of capital accumulation, is. According to the February 16 issue of the Japanese "Toyo Keizai Shimpo," a survey by the Japanese government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry of 30 major trading companies found that in the first half of 1950, its capital structure only accounted for 5 percent of its own capital; the other 95 percent of the capital was composed of long-term loans, short-term loans, accounts payable and other liabilities.

Because Japan's domestic market is increasingly shrinking, Japan's industry and commerce are also increasingly losing their basis for survival. The most obvious example is that, on the one hand, Japanese textile companies have closed down in large numbers due to overproduction since last autumn; on the other hand, last year, the average amount of cotton yarn used by the Japanese people per person per year was only two pounds, only one-third of the pre-war level. When the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea in the early stage of 1950, because American imperialism used Japan as its military supply base closest to the battlefield, issued a large number of military orders to Japan, and the capitalist camp in the world set off a wave of panic buying in preparation for expanding the war of aggression, the dying Japanese economy did appear to have a temporary false prosperity, but this was undoubtedly just a stopgap measure for the Japanese economy.

Because the fact is very obvious, the predatory military orders issued to Japan by the United States due to the Korean War, and the United States' forced implementation of hunger exports by Japan to accumulate funds for the development of Japan's military industry, both further reduced the living standards of the Japanese people. Even the fifth economic white paper published by the Japanese government in July last year had to admit that the consumption level of urban residents had decreased by 5 percent compared with before the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea. With the continuous failure of American imperialism in the Korean War and the cessation of the wave of panic buying in the world capitalist camp, the phenomenon of distorted development of the Japanese economy will inevitably be more seriously exposed than in the past. This is the root cause of the wave of bankruptcies in the Japanese business community since last year. To this day, this wave of bankruptcies still threatens the Japanese business community.

We Chinese people deeply sympathize with and are concerned about the painful situation of the Japanese people and the general business community. Nan Hanchen, head of the Chinese delegation to the Moscow International Economic Conference, pointed out in his report at the plenary session of the conference on April 4: "The Chinese people believe that if Japan can refuse rearmament, develop peaceful industries, and establish equal and mutually beneficial international trade relations with various countries, it will fully conform to the interests of the Japanese people." This passage points out a way out for the Japanese economy, which is currently in a difficult situation under the control of the American occupiers, and illustrates that only by following this path is it possible to improve the current economic situation in Japan and the living conditions of the Japanese people.

Japan and China have always had long-term trade relations, and the total value of imports and exports before the war reached 340 million US dollars per year. In 1938, 83 percent of the coking coal, 70 percent of the salt, and 80 percent of the soybeans imported by Japan were imported from China. In 1936, 27 percent of the iron ore needed by Japan and one-third of the imports were also obtained from China. In 1950, Sino-Japanese trade had a certain degree of recovery, but due to the evil policy of "blockade and embargo" implemented by the Yoshida government of Japan under the instruction of the United States, Sino-Japanese trade was in a state of stagnation.

This is obviously extremely detrimental to the Japanese economy. The Japanese people and Japanese business people have repeatedly criticized the Yoshida government for following the will of the American occupiers to implement artificial restrictions on Sino-Japanese trade, resulting in disastrous consequences, and unanimously demanded the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade. The Chinese people are willing to sincerely consider the calls of the Japanese people and Japanese business people. Head of Delegation Nan Hanchen also pointed out in the aforementioned report: "The Chinese people are willing to see Japan develop a healthy peaceful economy and restore and develop normal trade relations between China and Japan, so that the living conditions of the Japanese people will no longer be threatened and harmed by war and can be truly improved." Ms. Tomi Takara, a representative of Japan attending the International Economic Conference, also expressed the wishes of Japanese business people for the development of trade relations between Japan and China and other countries. She said, "If Japan establishes trade relations with its neighboring countries - the Soviet Union, China, etc., it will help to eliminate Japan's current economic difficulties." At the same time, she hopes that Japan will have the opportunity to trade with its neighboring countries in the near future, without having to purchase raw materials from distant countries.

Developing international economic relations under peaceful conditions is the path that all countries must follow. Japan's experience over a long period of time after the war, especially the experience in the two years since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, is sufficient to illustrate that Japan can only refuse rearmament and develop a peaceful economy to find a way out for the current Japanese economy.

    日本经济的出路
    庄涛
            （一）
    在美国占领者及其仆从吉田政府的长期统治下，日本的全部经济都被迫为美国的备战经济服务。这种情况，已使日本人民的生活极端贫困，并给日本的工商界带来严重的灾难。远的不说，仅仅美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争以来的不到两年中间，日本广大的工商界已尝尽了痛苦的滋味。关于这一过程，今年二月二十一日出版的日本资产阶级的“金钢钻”杂志，曾有一段辛酸的叙述：“朝鲜事变后日本经济的起伏是异常猛烈的。在事变爆发后的半年间，企业经营急速好转，出现了所谓利润膨胀的现象，这已是大家都知道的了。然而这一繁荣的寿命未免太短，从一九五一年上半年起，日本经济的情况即急转直下。去年四月遭受了第一次的冲击，七月又遭受了第二次的冲击。从去年秋天起，又经历了第三次的冲击，直到现在还卷在这一漩涡之中。结果是去秋以来公司、商号的倒闭。”据日本政府劳动省的调查，去年七月至九月，每月申请清理的企业，平均达二百六十八件，比去年一月至三月的每月平均一百六十二件，增加百分之六十五。
    这一自去秋以来日益加剧的日本工商界的倒风，到去年冬天更为猛烈，其中首先受到沉重打击的，是成为日本主要出口工业的纺织业。据二月一日日本“经济学人”杂志所载，从去年春天到十一月间，倒闭的纺织公司和商号，已达二百六十家。此外，美国发动侵朝战争以来一度吃香的日本的钢铁业，也同样处于不安的地位。去年十月日本普通钢钢材的销售额，已由七月的一百六十四亿七千万日元，跌至一百一十四亿零六千万日元，减缩了三分之一。因此，自去秋以来，日本钢铁制品的市场价格就不断下跌。以一点六公厘厚的薄钢板为例，去年九月八幡制铁会社（日本最大的国营钢铁公司）的标准价格为每吨七万五千日元，但市场价格仅为六万七千日元；十月末，八幡的标准价格跌至六万三千日元时，市场价格继续迅速下跌，到十二月上旬已跌至五万一千日元，比去秋降低百分之二十五。今年以来日本政府为缓和英镑过剩的困难而限制日本向英镑地区的出口以后，日本钢铁业的困难更为增加，这种日益增加的困难，已由存货的激增表现出来。截至二月底，日本普通钢钢材的存货已达六十万吨，为去年六月存货量的百分之二百四十。其他和平工业在猛烈的倒风影响下也日趋萧条。去年十一月，日本全国制造肥皂的工厂，已由去年春天的四百家减至二百六十三家，估计在今年一月能继续维持生产的不过一百三十家而已。
        （二）
    出现在日本工商业中的这股倒风，完全不是偶然的。这是美国重新武装日本，执行变日本为其殖民地和侵略亚洲的军事基地的罪恶政策所必然产生的结果。
    自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义为了达到其进攻中国、苏联，代替过去的日本帝国主义成为“亚洲的主人”的目的，从开始占领日本的时候起，就阴谋把日本继续拖上新的侵略战争的道路。它妄想用日本人的手和血来建立其在亚洲的统治。因此，这几年来，日本人民一直被迫担负着庞大的重新武装的预算。以一九五二年度的预算来说，全部金额八千五百二十七亿日元，约占一九五一年度日本国民收入四万五千亿日元的五分之一，比去年度预算（不包括去年末的追加预算）又增加将近百分之三十。其中直接用于日本变相的陆海军——“警察后备队”和“海上保安队”等的费用，就有二千零二十二亿日元，占预算总额的百分之二十三点七；其次，主要用于军事建设和补贴军事原料的公共事业费、地方财政平衡支付金和价格调整费，合计二千八百亿日元，占预算总额的百分之三十三。这一庞大的战争预算，对于目前处在停滞状态中的日本经济的影响是很大的。就连日本兴业银行经理川北祯一也担忧地说：“一九五二年度的八千五百亿财政规模，将给予国民经济以相当压力是完全可以预测的。”（一月一日日本“经济学人”杂志）
    不仅如此。美帝国主义更利用其在日本的占领制度来垄断日本的经济，对日本人民进行残酷的奴役与榨取。根据日本政府大藏省和外资委员会发表的数字，美国政府和美国资本家采取各种方式投入日本铁路、电气通信、电力、海运、钢铁、煤矿等基本产业部门的投资总额，已达三千二百亿日元，相当于日本全国股份公司实缴资本的总额。其中有二千八百亿日元，占投资总额的百分之九十，是采取“美援对等资金”的形式投入的。即美国把在日本高价出售过剩的棉花、小麦等商品所得的日元资金，再投入日本的产业部门，以达其一箭双雕的目的：既缓和了本国的经济恐慌，又控制了日本的经济。这样，粮食和棉花就成为战后日本进口的大宗。一九五一年，日本进口的粮食和棉花共达十亿一千七百万美元，占进口总额的百分之六十五，其中百分之六十四来自以美国为主的美元地区。这不仅摧毁了日本的工业，使其丧失了独立自主，而且又严重地摧残着日本的农业。
    美帝国主义为了垄断日本经济，进一步变日本为其侵略东南亚的远东工厂，更切断了日本与以中国为主的亚洲主要地区的经济联系，迫使日本从美国运来昂贵的原料进行生产，然后又把制成的商品，运往东南亚市场出售。由于战后日本缺乏船舶，这些运输的百分之八十，主要又是高价租用美国的船只来完成的。这种做法显然完全违背了成本核算的原理，而且也使日本工业家无利可图。日本著名经济学者、大阪商业大学教授名和统一，在去年十二月二十一日日本“经济学人”杂志著文称：“本来可以从中共买到的大量而廉价的强粘结性煤（炼焦用原料）、铁矿石与大豆，现在却以高价由美元地区输入。如由中共输入，煤每吨为十七美元，现在则为二十八、九美元；铁矿石为十三美元，现在则为二十四至二十七美元；大豆为一百美元，现在则为一百六十五美元。仅仅这一点，也就加重了日本经济对美元的依赖，提高了日本钢铁、机械的价格，使日本的输出能力受到显著的削弱。”
    由于上述种种，战后长期以来，日本的工业和对外贸易都不能获得正常的发展。一九五零年日本的对外贸易，仅及一九三四至一九三六年平均量的三分之一。战后日本军事工业和出口工业的局部恢复，主要也不是依靠其本身资金的积累，而是在国库大量补助下进行的。一九四九年，日本每吨生铁生产成本的百分之七十，是取自由日本人民血汗积累的国库补助金。据一九五一年九月末日本“东洋经济新报”的调查，日本每磅二十号棉纱的出口价格比国内价格低百分之十一。这样，就使日本的经济遭受更加沉重的压迫。
    美国重新武装日本，对日本进行残酷的奴役与榨取，驱使日本走上发展战争工业的道路，以及切断日本与以中国为主的亚洲主要地区的经济联系，已使日本经济处于奄奄一息的状态。日本的劳动人民不能不被迫挣扎在饥饿线上。据日本经济安定本部的调查，一九四九年六月，日本工人的实际工资已经降到一九三七年的百分之四十。在美国发动侵朝战争后的一年间，日本工人的实际工资又继续被迫降低，一般消费资料平均上涨百分之五十，但工人名义工资仅平均上升百分之九。
    日本农村的情况更为悲惨。一九四八年，日本农民所负担的捐税，平均占其现金收入的百分之三十五点九。再加上有日本国库津贴的美国粮食充塞日本市场，与日本政府以低于生产成本的价格强制征购农民的粮食，更使一般农民负债累累。据日本农林中央金库的调查，日本农民仅欠官方合作社和农林中央金库的借款，截至一九五零年九月已达一百四十四亿日元，至一九五一年九月更增至一百八十七亿日元，一年之中激增了将近百分之三十。这种情况造成了日本农村人口的流亡和耕地的荒废。据一九五二年的“日本读卖年鉴”所载，成为日本人民主要粮食的稻子的耕种面积，已由一九四五年的三百九十万町步（一町步约合一公顷弱），减至一九五零年的三百万町步，五年之内缩小了百分之二十四。
    日本的工商界，尤其是中小企业的处境也同样地痛苦。一九五○年，日本国民收入中的资产收入部分，仅占全部收入的百分之三点五，而在一九三四至一九三六年，则平均为百分之二十一点六。由此可见成为资本蓄积的最主要源泉的资产收入，是如何惊人地减少着。据今年二月十六日日本“东洋经济新报”所载，日本政府的通商产业省调查三十家主要贸易公司的结果，发现一九五○年上半年，其资本构成中，本身资本仅占百分之五；其他百分之九十五的资本，是由长期借款、短期借款、赊帐等负债部分构成的。
    因为日本的国内市场日益萎缩，所以日本的工商业也日益丧失其生存的根据。最明显的例子就是：一方面，去秋以来日本纺织公司因生产过剩而大批倒闭；另方面，去年日本人民每人全年使用的棉纱，平均不过二磅，仅及战前的三分之一。当一九五○年美国发动侵朝战争的初期，由于美帝国主义把日本作为其最接近战场的军需补给基地，向日本发出大量军事订货，以及世界资本主义阵营为准备扩大侵略战争而掀起了抢购物资的风潮以后，奄奄一息的日本经济，固然曾经出现了暂时的虚假的繁荣，但是这对于日本经济无疑的只是饮鸩止渴而已。
    因为事实很明显，美国因侵朝战争对日本发出的巧取豪夺的军事订货，以及美国为日本军事工业的发展积累资金而迫使日本实行饥饿输出，结果都进一步降低了日本人民的生活水准。连去年七月日本政府发表的第五次经济白皮书上，也不得不承认城市居民的消费水准已比美国发动侵朝战争以前降低百分之五。随着美帝国主义在侵朝战争中的不断失败，以及世界资本主义阵营抢购物资风潮的停止，日本经济的畸形发展的现象，就必然比过去更严重地显露出来。这就是去年以来日本工商界发生倒风的根本原因。直到今天，这股倒风还威胁着日本的工商界。
    我们中国人民对日本人民和一般工商界这种痛苦的处境，是深切地同情和关切的。我国出席莫斯科国际经济会议代表团团长南汉宸，在该会议四月四日全体大会上发表的报告中指出：“中国人民认为日本如能拒绝重新武装，发展和平工业，并与各国建立平等互利的国际贸易关系，将完全符合于日本人民的利益”。这段话给目前在美国占领者控制下陷于困难境地的日本经济指出一条出路，说明了只有走这条道路，才有可能改善目前日本的经济情况和日本人民的生活状况。
    日本和中国一直有着长期的贸易关系，战前输出入总值曾年达三亿四千万美元。在一九三八年，日本进口的炼焦用煤的百分之八十三，盐的百分之七十和大豆的百分之八十，都是从中国输入的。在一九三六年，日本所需的铁矿石的百分之二十七与进口的三分之一，也是从中国取得的。一九五○年，中日贸易曾有一定程度的恢复，但是由于美国指使日本吉田政府对我实行“封锁禁运”的罪恶政策，而使中日贸易陷于停顿状态。
    这对于日本经济显然是极端不利的。日本人民和日本工商业人士已一再指责吉田政府顺从美国占领者的意旨对中日贸易实行人为的限制所造成的灾难性的后果，并一致要求恢复中日贸易。对于日本人民和日本工商人士的这种呼声，中国人民是愿意诚恳地加以考虑的。南汉宸团长在前述的报告中也曾指出：“中国人民愿意看到日本能够健全发展和平经济，并恢复和发展中日两国间的正常贸易关系，使日本人民的生活条件不再遭受战争的威胁和损害而得到真正改善的可能。”日本出席国际经济会议代表高良富女士也说出了日本一般工商界人士对于发展日本对中国和其他国家贸易关系的愿望，她说：“日本如和它的邻国——苏联、中国等建立贸易关系，那将有助于消除目前日本的经济困难。”同时，她希望日本在不久的将来能有机会和它的邻国贸易，而不必再从遥远的国家购买原料。
    在和平条件下发展国际经济关系，是各国必须遵循的道路。日本战后长期以来的经历，特别是美国发动侵朝战争以来两年间的经历，已足够说明，日本只有拒绝重新武装、发展和平经济，才是目前日本经济的出路。
