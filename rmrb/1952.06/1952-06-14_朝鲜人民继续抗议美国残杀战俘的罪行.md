Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 13th: The Korean people are expressing irrepressible anger at the American aggressors' barbaric slaughter of our captured personnel. Leaders of various Korean democratic political parties and people's organizations continue to issue statements protesting this atrocity by the American aggressors.

    Won Dong-geun, Vice Chairman of the Korean Professional General Federation, said: The Korean working class, along with all the people, strongly protests the increasingly beastly atrocities of the American aggressors and resolutely demands that these murderers be severely punished. We must closely unite around the Korean Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung, strike the enemy even harder, and greet June 25th – "Day of Struggle Against US Imperialism" – with greater labor achievements and increased production, resolutely defending the freedom and independence of the motherland and lasting world peace.
    Li Huan-qi, Vice Chairman of the Korean Democratic Youth League, said: Korean youth resolutely demand severe sanctions against the criminals who are intensifying the slaughter of our captured personnel. American murderers must bear the serious responsibility for creating these crimes. We warmly sympathize with and support the heroic and unyielding just struggle of our captured personnel, and with unwavering determination, we will rescue our captured personnel from the clutches of the American murderous demons.
    Li Ying, Chairman of the Korean Working People's Party, said: The heinous enemy brutally and viciously slaughtered our captured personnel at will, simply because they were unwilling to betray the motherland and unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. This bloody slaughter was carried out in an organized and planned manner. All our compatriots have risen up and, together with all good people in the world, denounce the atrocities of the American aggressors and will resolutely sever their murderous hands.
    Kim Won-bong, Chairman of the Korean People's Republican Party, said: The enemy's atrocities have aroused greater anger among all the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world. We express to our captured personnel that we will absolutely not allow them to suffer humiliation and hardship, and will not allow them to be killed. He called on all the Korean people to wage a resolute struggle against the irreconcilable enemy to avenge the dead.
    People from all walks of life in various parts of Korea have held protest rallies. At a protest rally of youth representatives from all walks of life in the Pyongyang area, Zheng Guolie, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Democratic Youth League, youth worker Kim Hyo-jin, youth student Li Rong-ji and others, unanimously and angrily denounced the American aggressors' sinister plot to achieve their goal of detaining a large number of our captured personnel by means of bloody suppression and brutal slaughter. They expressed that they would further strengthen the anti-aggression struggle and demand blood debts from the American murderers.

    朝鲜人民继续抗议美国残杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜人民对于美国侵略者残酷屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行，表示不可遏止的愤怒。朝鲜各民主政党和人民团体的负责人继续发表谈话，抗议美国侵略者的这一暴行。
    朝鲜职业总同盟副委员长元东根说：朝鲜工人阶级和全体人民一起严重抗议美国侵略者有加无已的野兽暴行，并坚决要求严惩这些杀人罪犯。我们一定要紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党与领袖金日成将军的周围，更沉重地打击敌人，以更大的劳动成果与增产成绩来迎接六月二十五日——“反对美帝国主义的斗争日”，坚决捍卫祖国的自由独立与世界的持久和平。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟副委员长李焕起说：朝鲜青年坚决要求严厉制裁那些变本加厉地屠杀我方被俘人员的罪犯。美国杀人犯必须担负制造这种罪行的严重责任。我们热烈同情和支持我方被俘人员的英勇不屈的正义斗争，并要以坚定不移的决心，从美国杀人魔鬼的魔掌中拯救我方被俘人员。
    朝鲜勤劳人民党委员长李英说：万恶的敌人只是由于我方被俘人员不愿背叛祖国，不愿为李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰，就残暴而凶恶地任意屠杀他们。这种血腥屠杀是有组织有计划地进行的。我国全体同胞已奋起和全世界所有善良人民一起痛斥美国侵略者的暴行，并要坚决斩断它的杀人血手。
    朝鲜人民共和党委员长金元凤说：敌人的暴行已激起了全朝鲜人民与全世界爱好和平人民的更大的愤怒。我们向我方被俘人员表示，我们是绝对不会听任他们身受凌辱与苦难，听任他们被杀害的。他号召全朝鲜人民和不共戴天的敌人作坚决斗争，替死难者报仇。
    朝鲜各地各阶层人民纷纷举行抗议大会。在平壤地区各界青年代表的抗议大会上，平壤市民主青年同盟委员长郑国烈、青年工人金孝镇、青年学生李荣基等，一致激愤地斥责美国侵略者企图以血腥镇压与残暴屠杀的手段来达到其大量扣留我方被俘人员目的的罪恶阴谋。他们表示要进一步加强反侵略的斗争，向美国杀人犯索取血债。
