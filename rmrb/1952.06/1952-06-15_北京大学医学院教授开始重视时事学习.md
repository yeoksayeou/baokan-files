Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The "Letters from Readers" column in the People's Daily on May 24th published Comrade Xiang Chen's letter, criticizing the phenomenon of some professors in our college not paying attention to current affairs study. This criticism is correct. In the past, the administrative leaders of our college never inquired about the current affairs study of teachers, students, staff, and workers. It was not until the People's Daily criticized the phenomenon of some agency staff neglecting to read the newspaper that we paid attention to this issue. We held a current affairs test for the entire college and established newspaper reading groups to promote newspaper reading and learning among teachers and students in all aspects. Recently, most professors in our college have been able to read the newspaper seriously, reading for half an hour to one and a half hours each day. They not only read in detail themselves, but also展开 discussions in groups. A trend of caring about political issues has begun to grow among the professors.
    How to make teachers value current affairs study? We believe that the problem should be solved ideologically. In the past, due to the influence of pro-American and worshipful-of-America ideas, some professors could not hate American imperialism and could not love the motherland; coupled with various erroneous views such as so-called "above politics" and "above class," they were even more indifferent to current affairs issues published in the newspapers. At present, the teachers of Peking University Medical College are carrying out an in-depth ideological remoulding movement, criticizing the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression and decadent bourgeois ideology they have suffered. They are gradually raising their political awareness, and therefore, current affairs and political study are being given more attention.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京大学医学院教授开始重视时事学习
    编辑同志：五月二十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了湘琛同志的来信，批评我院部分教授不重视时事学习的现象。这个批评是正确的。我院行政领导方面过去对师、生、员、工的时事学习，从来没有过问，直到人民日报对某些机关工作人员忽视读报的现象提出批评以后，我们才重视了这个问题。我们在全院举行了时事测验，建立了读报小组，从各方面推动师生的读报学习。最近，我院大部分教授都能认真读报，每天读半小时到一小时半不等。他们不但自己详细阅读，并且还在小组里展开讨论。关心政治问题的风气，已开始在教授中生长出来。
    如何使教师们重视时事学习呢？我们认为应当从思想上解决问题。过去由于亲美、崇美等思想作祟，部分教授对美帝国主义恨不起来，对祖国爱不起来；加上所谓“超政治”“超阶级”等各种错误观点，他们对报纸上所刊载的时事问题，就更漠不关心了。目前，北京大学医学院的教师们正在深入开展思想改造运动，批判自己所受的美帝国主义文化侵略的影响和腐朽的资产阶级思想。他们正在逐步提高自己的政治觉悟，因此，时事和政治学习，更加被重视了。
