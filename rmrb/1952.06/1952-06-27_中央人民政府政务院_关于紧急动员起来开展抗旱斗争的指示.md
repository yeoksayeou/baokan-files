Since late May, North China, Northwest China, and parts of Central and South China have experienced prolonged drought and little rain, seriously affecting the sowing of summer crops and the growth of seedlings. In some areas, major autumn crops have not been planted at all; in wheat-producing areas, much of the wheat stubble land has not been sown in time due to the drought; some shallow-rooted crops such as corn and sorghum are withering due to the drought; in parts of Hubei and Hunan provinces, some rice paddies have begun to dehydrate and crack, and the seedlings are turning yellow; some provinces in the South that have experienced prolonged rain have recently turned sunny, and there is also a possibility of drought. However, some cadres in these areas, due to the relatively high spring rainfall, are not sufficiently alert to the drought and have failed to promptly mobilize the masses to take emergency measures to combat the drought. Therefore, under the current severe threat of summer drought, vigorously carrying out the struggle against drought, fully utilizing water sources, and implementing emergency planting and seedling protection are the most urgent tasks that override all others in rural work in the aforementioned areas. The leading organs in these areas must be highly vigilant against this severe drought and must not be the slightest bit negligent or slack, otherwise, allowing it to develop will lead to mistakes, causing losses to this year's agricultural production and thus bringing difficulties to the country's economic construction. All areas where drought has already appeared must be urgently mobilized to carry out the struggle against drought with all their strength, striving to replant major autumn crops, striving to plant crops on wheat stubble land, and striving to irrigate and save all drought-stricken fields and seedlings. To this end, all localities must do the following specific drought relief work:

	I. Adopt emergency measures that require less labor and yield quick results, and make full use of all water sources. In the plains, dig many earth wells; in the mountains, open up and dredge spring eyes. All localities should learn from the experience of last year's drought relief struggle, give full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and use all favorable conditions in various places to increase water sources and expand the area of irrigated land.

	II. Conduct a comprehensive inspection of all existing irrigation equipment, repair it in a timely manner, and give full play to its irrigation role; strengthen management, conserve water, and maximize the irrigation efficiency of water. Promote methods such as ditch irrigation, shallow irrigation, day and night rotation irrigation, carrying water for spot irrigation, and spot planting, and eliminate all phenomena of water wastage. Promote the spirit of mutual assistance and concession, and advocate using surplus water to supply nearby water-deficient areas, ensuring that all fields in the irrigated area can complete summer planting and seedling irrigation.

	III. For dryland crops, promote shallow hoeing to protect seedlings and reduce water evaporation. Cotton is at the appropriate time for applying topdressing fertilizer and should promote the method of drilling holes for spot irrigation and applying liquid manure.

	IV. In the emergency struggle to fight drought and save seedlings, there are often temporary cases of digging embankments to release water and building dams to block water in areas along the rivers. In order to prevent floods and ensure the use of water in the channels downstream of the river, it is necessary to persuade farmers to close the gaps and remove dikes in a timely manner. Areas prone to waterlogging should also pay attention to flood prevention at the same time.

	It is now the critical moment of the agricultural season. Leading organs in all localities must concentrate their efforts to lead the peasant masses, victoriously carry out the struggle against drought, complete the replanting of major autumn crops in a timely manner, complete summer planting and seedling protection in a timely manner, and combine this with other emergency work such as pest control and flood prevention, to ensure the thorough implementation of the patriotic production increase plan on the agricultural front.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于紧急动员起来开展抗旱斗争的指示
    五月下旬以来，华北、西北和中南部分地区，久旱少雨，严重地影响了夏田播种与禾苗成长。其中，有些地区大秋作物根本没有种上；产麦区域多部麦茬地因旱未能及时播种；部分浅根作物如玉米、高粱等，更因受旱而呈枯萎；湖北、湖南两省部分稻田开始脱水干裂，秧苗转黄；南方部分久雨省区最近转晴，亦有发生干旱的可能。而有些地区的干部，又因春雨较多，对旱象警惕不够，未能及时发动群众采取抗旱的紧急措施。因此，在目前夏旱严重威胁下，大力开展抗旱斗争，充分利用水源，实行抢种保苗，已是上述地区农村工作中压倒一切的最紧迫的任务。各该地区的领导机关必须对于此种严重旱象引起高度警惕，不得有丝毫麻痹松懈，否则任其发展，就会造成错误，使今年农业生产受到损失，从而给国家经济建设带来困难。一切已呈旱象的地区，必须紧急动员起来，以全力开展抗旱斗争，争取补种大秋作物，争取种上麦茬地的庄稼，争取灌救一切受旱田地的禾苗。为此，各地必须作好下列具体抗旱工作：
    一、采用需工少、收效快的应急办法，充分利用一切水源。平原要大量打土井，山地要开凿与疏浚泉眼。各地应吸取去年抗旱斗争的经验，发挥群众智慧与群众力量，利用各地一切有利的条件，增加水源，扩大浇地面积。
    二、对现有一切灌溉设备，要普遍检查，及时修整，充分发挥其灌溉作用；并须加强管理，节约用水，提高水的最大灌溉效能。推行沟浇、浅浇、日夜轮浇、担水点浇、点种等办法，消灭一切浪费水量现象。发扬互助互让精神，提倡以节余水量，供应邻近缺水地区，确保灌区所有田地都能完成夏种浇苗。
    三、旱地作物要提倡浅锄保苗，减少水分蒸发。棉花正是施追肥的适当时期，应推广凿孔点浇办法，追施水粪。
    四、在抗旱救苗的紧急斗争中，沿河地区时有临时扒堤放水、打坝拦水的情况。为防范水患，并保证河道下游的渠道用水，必须劝导农民及时堵复缺口，拆除埝堤。易受水涝地区，并应同时注意防涝。
    目前已是农业季节的紧急关头，各地领导机关必须集中力量领导农民群众，胜利地进行抗旱斗争，及时补种大秋作物，及时完成夏种保苗，并结合进行治虫、防汛等其它紧急工作，以保证农业战线上爱国增产计划的彻底实施。总理周恩来一九五二年六月二十六日
