    A Sharp Contrast Between Us and the Enemy
    —Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression
    Guo Moruo
    The just war of resisting American imperialist aggression on the Korean battlefield has reached its second anniversary. In the two years of war, the Chinese and Korean People's forces have achieved great victories, and the American aggressors have suffered a tragic defeat. This is something that American imperialists did not anticipate. American imperialists originally wanted to swallow up Korea in a short period of time and further invade China, but their arrogant attempt has been completely shattered.

    The failure of American imperialism in the Korean War exposed this truth: although American imperialism is more brutal and tyrannical than the German and Japanese fascist countries, its strength is even more fragile.

    Due to the exposure of this truth, many small and weak countries in the world have begun to realize that the seemingly strong but inwardly weak American imperialism is not terrible and not invincible. American imperialism has suffered serious military defeats on the Korean battlefield, resulting in a loss of political prestige, increased economic difficulties, and increasing internal strife within the aggressive bloc. It has also increasingly lost control on the diplomatic and economic fronts.

    First of all, the United Nations voting machine, which is under the control of the United States, has malfunctioned several times. Many countries that have been oppressed in the past are no longer willing to be bossed around by the United States and have adopted a neutral or even opposing attitude.

    In order to save itself from defeat, American imperialism has been frantically expanding its arms race and adopting policies of "blockade" and "embargo." However, the result is that the economic situation of many countries has been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, many small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, and even large capitalists, in these countries have had to break through the blockade and take a direction opposite to that of the United States in order to find a way out. The success of the Moscow International Economic Conference marked the beginning of the failure of American imperialism on the economic front.

    It can be seen from this that, starting with the failure of the Korean War, the path that American imperialism is taking is clearly one of moving from one failure to another.

    The American warmongers originally took war as a gamble, and here they naturally display the psychology of gamblers: the more they fail, the less willing they are to give up.

    Since American imperialism was forced to accept armistice negotiations, it has exhausted its shameless rogue tactics and is still procrastinating today. It has used bacteriological bombs, napalm bombs, and gas bombs on a large scale, and has大规模 massacred 朝中 prisoners of war on 거제도. It has done almost all the bad things that violate human morality and destroy international conventions beyond imagination.

    People are already calling Ridgway the Plague General, and we can even more righteously call the American government the Plague Government. Isn't it conceivable to what extent American imperialism has failed?

    In contrast to the enemy's failure, the common victory of the Chinese and Korean people in the War of Resistance Against America shows its great significance in many ways.

    The heroic posture of the heroic Korean people is particularly prominent in front of us today. The heroic posture of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, is also equally prominent in front of us.

    Our reason is very clear. Our purpose is only to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, that is, Korean internal affairs should be handled by the Korean people themselves, without any external interference.

    As long as this goal is not achieved, our just action of resisting America and aiding Korea cannot be stopped for a single day.

    敌我鲜明的对比
    ——纪念朝鲜反侵略战争两周年
    郭沫若
    在朝鲜战场上反抗美帝国主义侵略的正义战争已经满两周年了。在两年的战争中，中朝人民部队取得了伟大的胜利，美国侵略者已遭受了悲惨的失败。这是美帝国主义者所没有预想到的事。美帝国主义者原想在短时期内吞灭朝鲜，更进而侵略中国，但它的这个狂妄的企图已经完全粉碎了。
    美帝国主义在侵朝战争中的失败暴露了这样一个真实，便是美帝国主义虽然比德日法西斯国家更加蛮横残暴，而它的力量却是更加脆弱。
    由于这一真实的暴露，世界上好些弱小国家便开始认识到外强中干的美帝国主义并不可怕，并不是不可击败的。美帝国主义由于在朝鲜战场上遭到严重的军事失败，因而政治威信扫地，经济困难增加，侵略集团内部争吵日益增多，它在外交战线上和经济战线上也就愈益失掉了控制力。
    首先是在美国掌握中的联合国的投票机器，我们好几次看出它已经运用失灵了。有好些向来受压迫的国家已经不甘愿受美国的颐指气使，而采取了中立甚至反对的态度。
    美帝国主义为了挽救自己的失败，愈益疯狂地扩军备战，采取“封锁”“禁运”的政策，然而结果是使好些国家的经济状况被逼到了破产的边缘。因而好些国家的中小工商业者乃至大资本家们为了找寻生路，便不能不突破封锁，和美国的政策采取相反的方向。莫斯科国际经济会议的成功便表明着美帝国主义在经济战线上的失败的开始。
    由此可见，美帝国主义以侵朝战争的失败为起点，它所走着的路明明白白地是由一个失败走向另一个失败。
    美国的战争贩子们本来是以战争为赌博的，在这儿便很自然地表现出赌棍的心理：愈失败愈不甘心。
    美帝国主义被迫接受停战谈判以来，耍尽了无耻的流氓手段，在今天依然在拖延。大量地使用细菌弹、凝固汽油弹、毒气弹，在巨济岛上大规模地虐杀朝中被俘人员，出人想像之外地把违背人类道德、破坏国际公约的一切坏事差不多都做尽了。
    人们已经在称呼李奇微为瘟疫将军，我们更可以理直气壮地称呼美国政府为瘟疫政府。美帝国主义的失败已经到了怎样的程度不是可以想见的吗？
    和敌人的失败相对比，朝中人民在抗美战争中的共同胜利，更可以看出它的多方面的伟大意义。
    英雄民族朝鲜人民的英雄姿态，在今天特别突出地显现在我们的面前。中国人民优秀的儿女中国人民志愿军的英雄姿态，也同样突出地显现在我们的面前。
    我们的理智是很清明的。我们的目的只是在和平解决朝鲜问题，即朝鲜内政应由朝鲜人民自行处理，而不应受任何外来的干涉。
    这样的目的一天不能达到，我们的抗美援朝的正义行动便一天也不能中止。
