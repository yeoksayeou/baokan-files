    The Philippine Peace Movement and the Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism
    Manuel Cruz, Philippine Representative to the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Due to necessity and the demands of the vast majority of the people, our country's peace movement has always been combined with the national liberation movement and the struggle against U.S. imperialism. Because the Filipino people have accounts to settle with those so-called "benevolent" rulers of Wall Street and the Pentagon and their lackeys in the Philippines.

    U.S. imperialism has directly interfered in our internal affairs twice (the people of the Philippines and the United States are increasingly aware of these crimes, despite repeated attempts by U.S. imperialism's servants to obscure it from world public attention, including the fraudulent granting of fake independence to the Philippines on July 4, 1946). It is well known that at the end of the 19th century, after the young peasant leader Andres Bonifacio successfully led our peasants in rising up against Spanish colonialism, we established our own independent republic. At that time, we gained the same independence as the American people had obtained 120 years earlier. However, it was this country, which had also gained independence through struggle, that stepped in and snatched our independence from us. American expansionists should not easily forget this historical fact, because the struggle for independence also caused them significant losses in manpower and material resources. For three and a half years, U.S. imperialism used all kinds of military and economic violence to impose colonial shackles on the Filipino people. Since then, the Philippines has become a victim of imperialist exploitation, with American colonists using military suppression and economic extortion to seek profits for Wall Street.

    Forty-seven years later, the war against Japanese fascist militarism ended. During the war against Japan, the American colonists fled, abandoning the Filipino people to the mercy of the Japanese militarists. Disregarding the Filipino people's desire to resist to the end, the American army surrendered our country to the Japanese militarists, handing over our country's ancestral heritage with both hands—all of this happened in less than a year after the first Japanese troops landed in the Philippines. At the same time, the Filipino workers and peasants launched a brave and sustained guerrilla war against the occupying forces for three whole years. Therefore, on the day of victory in the war against Japan, when the American exploiters and their Filipino lackeys returned to seize the victory won by the Filipino people against Japanese fascist militarism, most of Central Luzon and many villages and towns in the south and north had already established their people's committees and raised the Philippine flag. As soon as the American betrayers set foot on our land, they immediately declared our anti-Japanese forces to be "bandits," illegal, and un-American. They cooperated with the Filipino traitors and the mercenaries of the landlords and capitalists, as well as so-called "civilian defense" forces, to attack the Filipino people.

    However, during the entire Japanese occupation, the Filipino people had realized the value of mass organizations and armed struggle. They understood that if they wanted to overthrow their colonial masters, they must organize the masses and carry out armed struggle. They also saw and felt their own organized strength and their infinite ability to endure hardship and self-sacrifice for the cause of the people. They were no longer willing to be enslaved again by the American invaders. The anti-Japanese forces that had been declared "illegal," now the National Liberation Army, are an army fighting against U.S. imperialism for the establishment of genuine and lasting peace and people's democracy. In the past decade, this people's army has grown in experience, strength, and influence. Facts have proven that today, after the victory in the war against Japan, no returning colonialist can subdue the masses with threats and intimidation, as is the case in Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia. This is one of our greatest contributions to the cause of defending peace, and it is also one of the greatest obstacles encountered by American war-mongers in their preparations for war.

    After the start of the Korean War, under the orders of Washington and the Pentagon, the Quirino government wanted to send Filipino men to Korea in 1950 to serve as cannon fodder for American big business. The Filipino people warned the American aggressors at that time: Today, the people of the world need peace. American lies and deceptions cannot deceive anyone. We are unwilling to die for a foreign, crazy imperialist war gamble. On August 14, 1950, the Philippine Congress of Labour Organizations, meeting in Manila, passed a resolution that included a ban on intervention in Korea. This shows that Filipino workers are against war, they support peace, and they are prepared to contribute their lives to defend peace.

    Since then, in order to defend world peace and oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of preparing for war, especially opposing the rearmament of Japan, the one-sided peace treaty with Japan, and the restoration of Philippine-Japanese commercial relations for the benefit of American capitalists, demonstrations by workers, peasants, students, and professionals have been constantly occurring. The response of the U.S.-Philippine reactionaries to this action by the people has been to directly attack the people's civil rights with brutal force, and to carry out mass arrests and massacres of peace activists and patriots. Under these circumstances, we understand that it is inevitable to encounter many difficulties in carrying out a peace movement in our country by peaceful means. These arrests and massacres have made the masses of the people even more dissatisfied due to the loss of the most basic human rights, and they are resisting even more heroically. Those who do not have the power to fight for bread and freedom in Congress often join the ranks of the National Liberation Army, rather than stay in the cities and suffer arrest.

    Some people in the big cities may not know the truth, because the truth is covered by a heavy smokescreen of American lies and deceptive propaganda. They do not know who the real aggressor is in the current military conflict in Korea? Who is using all kinds of inhumane means of mass killing, such as germ bombs and poison gas? But the Filipino people, like their brothers and sisters in other Asian and Pacific regions who are now suffering aggression, certainly know that if they allow U.S. imperialism to do whatever it wants in Korea, then they are allowing U.S. imperialism to do the same to them tomorrow.

    Thanks to the heroic self-sacrifice of the Korean and Chinese people who thwarted the operational plans of the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield.

    The Filipino people may not know the whole truth about the American expansionists' frantic rearmament of Japan, but they certainly know and firmly remember the losses in life and property caused to them by the last Japanese fascist militarism.

    The Filipino people may not fully know the war policies of the American colonists in their country, but due to their increasing awareness, they certainly know that listening to Washington's instructions to send Filipino children to die in Korea is a violation of the dignity of a nation. And they know that the twenty-three military bases established throughout the country are by no means a guarantee of peace and security in Asia and the Pacific.

    The Filipino people may have believed in the past that there was something like freedom and civil liberties existing in the country, but when Washington's military executioner in the Philippines—Defense Minister Ramon Magsaysay—systematically carried out massacres of citizens and mass arrests of trade union members, professors, journalists, and students, they knew that they had been living in a fantasy all along.

    Although some "historians" regard the Philippines as an "outpost" of U.S. imperialism in the Far East, and therefore believe that it is easy for U.S. imperialism to ask the Filipino people to support the remilitarization of Japan in order to expand its aggression in Asia and the Pacific. But they forget one thing, they have not taken into account that the people whom U.S. imperialism is asking to support its own evil actions are the people who suffered the second most after China in the last expansion of Japanese militarism in Asia and the Pacific. Not to mention the huge losses caused by the scorched earth policy adopted by the American army during its retreat and return.

    The friends of China and all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people in the Asian and Pacific region, may not know the true desires and aspirations of the Filipino people. Because the voice of the real Filipino people has no chance to be heard in those newspapers and broadcasts ruled by imperialism. But this should not mislead people, nor should it give the impression that the Filipino people do not want peace or are unwilling to fight to defend peace. The voices of Quirino and Truman are by no means the voices of the Filipino people.

    Therefore, the Filipino people are grateful that the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which has just concluded, has pointed out a path to follow for the Filipino people. Such a conference for peace is an answer to the long-standing aspirations of the Filipino people. Their desire is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Asia and the Pacific region to defeat the anti-peace conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. They want to make their best efforts to contribute to this great cause. At the same time, they hope that this upcoming conference can solve the problems of Asia and the Pacific: an early end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of foreign interventionists from Vietnam and Malaya, and the abolition of all military facilities established by U.S. imperialism in the Philippines for aggression. Finally, they hope to obtain through this conference the free and unimpeded exchange of cultural heritage and trade. The implementation of this exchange will be a prerequisite for the future establishment of mutual respect and mutual assistance between Asian and Pacific countries, and it is also a guarantee of peace.

    The Filipino people hope that this upcoming conference will be an unprecedented success, and extend congratulations to the eleven Chinese peace fighters headed by Soong Ching Ling and Guo Moruo who issued a call to peace comrades in Asia and the Pacific.

    菲律宾和平运动和反对美帝国主义的斗争
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议菲律宾代表  马纽尔·柯鲁兹
    由于必要和广大人民的要求，我国的和平运动一直是与民族解放运动和反对美帝国主义的斗争结合在一起的。因为菲律宾人民跟那些华尔街与五角大楼的所谓“仁慈”的统治者及其在菲律宾的走狗，是有账要算的。
    美帝国主义曾经两次直接干涉我国内政（菲律宾和美国人民对这种罪行已经越来越明白，尽管美帝国主义的仆役屡次企图蒙蔽世界公众对它的注意，包括一九四六年七月四日赐予菲律宾假独立的欺诈行为在内。）十九世纪末叶，年青的农民领袖安德瑞斯·邦尼法其欧（Andres Bonifacio）领导我国农民起来反对西班牙殖民主义成功之后，我们就成立了我们自己的独立共和国，这是世所周知的。当时，我们就获得了正如美国人民在一百二十年前时所获得的独立一样。然而，正是这个也曾经过斗争获得独立的国家，一脚?了进来，从我们手中夺走了我们的独立。美国扩张主义者是不应轻易忘记这历史性的事实的，因为争取独立的斗争也曾使他们在人力上和物质上遭受重大的损失。整整三年半时间内，美帝国主义使用了军事上和经济上种种暴力，才把殖民枷锁套在菲律宾人民的身上。从此，菲律宾就成为帝国主义剥削下的一个牺牲者，美国殖民者以军事的镇压和经济勒索的手段为华尔街谋取利润。
    四十七年以后，对日本法西斯军国主义的战争结束了。在对日作战期间，美国殖民者逃跑了，他们把菲律宾人民抛下任日本军国主义者宰割。美国军队不顾菲律宾人民抗战到底的愿望，把我们的国家让给日本军国主义者，把我们的祖国的世传产业双手献出——这一切都发生在第一批日军在菲律宾登陆后还不到一年的时候。与此同时，菲律宾工农大众则整整三年来都在对占领军展开勇敢、持久的游击抗战。所以在对日战争胜利日，当美国剥削者及其菲律宾走狗们重新回来企图掠取菲律宾人民对日本法西斯军国主义所取得的胜利时，中部吕宋的大部和南方以及北方的许多村镇都已经建立起他们的人民委员会，挂起菲律宾的国旗。美国出卖者一经踏上我们的土地，立即宣称我们的抗日部队是“匪”军，是非法的，非美国式的，他们与菲律宾的卖国贼和地主的雇佣军以及资本家的所谓“民卫”队合作，向菲律宾人民进攻。
    不过，菲律宾人民在整个日本占领期间已经认识到群众组织和武装斗争的价值，他们明白，如果要推翻殖民地主子，必须组织群众和进行武装斗争；他们也看到了和感到了他们自己的有组织的力量和为人民的事业而忍受艰苦和自我牺牲的无穷的能力；他们再不愿被美国侵略者重新奴役。被宣布为“非法”的抗日军队，即现在的民族解放军，是一支反对美帝国主义、为建立真正和持久和平与人民民主而奋斗的军队。最近十年来，这一支人民军队在经验、力量和影响方面，都有增进。事实已经证明，在对日战争胜利之后的今天，任何卷土重来的殖民者，都不能再用威胁与恫吓手段使群众屈服了，在越南、马来亚、缅甸和印度尼西亚都是如此。这是我们保卫和平事业中最大贡献之一，也是美国战争挑拨者在备战中所遇到的最大障碍之一。
    朝鲜战争开始后，在华盛顿和五角大楼的命令下，季里诺政府在一九五○年要派遣菲律宾男子到朝鲜去替美国大企业家当炮灰。菲律宾人民当时警告美国侵略者说：今天世界的人民需要和平，美国的谎言和欺诈蒙蔽不了任何人，我们不愿为一个国外的疯狂的帝国主义战争赌博去送死。一九五○年八月十四日，在马尼剌召开的菲律宾工会大会（ThePhilippine Congress of Labour Organizations）通过决议，其中有一条是禁止干涉朝鲜。这说明菲律宾工人是反对战争的，他们拥护和平，并准备为保卫和平不惜贡献自己的生命。
    此后，为了保卫世界和平和反对美帝国主义备战政策，特别是反对重新武装日本、片面对日和约和为了美国资本家利益而恢复菲日商业关系，工人、农民、学生和自由职业者的示威游行不断发生。美菲反动派对于人民这一行动的回答是：以粗暴的武力直接攻击人民的公民权利，大批逮捕和屠杀非战分子和爱国者。在这种情况下，我们明白在我们国家内用和平方式进行和平运动必然要遇到很多困难。这些逮捕和屠杀事件使人民大众因失去最基本的人权而更加不满，反抗得更加英勇。那些没有权力在国会中为面包和自由而斗争的人们，往往去加入民族解放军队伍，而不愿留在城市，遭受逮捕。
    有些大城市里的人，可能还不知道真象，因为真象是被美国的谎言与欺骗宣传的重重烟幕所掩盖了。他们不知道在目前朝鲜军事冲突里谁是真正的侵略者？是谁在使用着各种非人道的大量屠杀人民的手段，如细菌弹与毒气？但是菲律宾人民，像其他现在正遭受侵略的亚洲及太平洋区域的兄弟姐妹们同样地确实知道，假如他们允许美帝国主义在朝鲜为所欲为，那末他们就等于允许美帝国主义明天同样来对付他们。
    感谢英勇的自我牺牲的朝鲜人民与中国人民挫败了在朝鲜战场上美国侵略者的作战计划。
    菲律宾人民或许不知道关于美国扩张主义者疯狂武装日本的全部真象，但是他们确实知道并且牢牢地记得上一次日本法西斯军国主义给他们在生命上与财产上所引起的损失。
    菲律宾人民或许不完全知道美国殖民者在他们国家里的战争政策，但是由于日益增涨的觉醒，他们确实知道，听受华盛顿的指令叫菲律宾的孩子们去死在朝鲜是违反一个民族的尊严的。并且他们知道，在全国设立的二十三个军事基地绝不是对亚洲与太平洋的和平与安全的保证。
    菲律宾人民或许在过去还相信有一种类似自由与公民自由的情况在国内存在，但是当华盛顿在菲律宾的军事刽子手——国防部长雷蒙·麦格赛赛有步骤地大量屠杀公民，大量逮捕工会会员、教授、新闻记者与学生，他们就知道他们一向是生活在幻想中。
    虽然有些“史学家”将菲律宾看作是美帝国主义在远东的“前哨”，因此认为美帝国主义为了在亚洲与太平洋扩大侵略而要求菲律宾人民支援美国使日本重新军国主义化，是一件很容易的事。但是他们忘记了一点，他们没有考虑到美帝国主义所要求支援自己罪恶行动的正是在上次日本军国主义在亚洲与太平洋扩张势力当中受到痛苦仅次于中国的人民。美国军队在退却与卷土重来时采取焦土政策所造成的巨大损失更不用提了。
    中国的朋友和世界上所有爱好和平的人民，特别是在亚洲与太平洋区域的人民，可能还不知道菲律宾人民真正的渴望与抱负。因为真正的菲律宾人民的声音是不可能有机会在那些帝国主义统治的报纸上与广播中听到的。但是这不应使人们误会，也不要因此而得到一种印象，觉得菲律宾人民并不愿要和平也不愿为保卫和平而斗争，季里诺及杜鲁门的声音决不是菲律宾人民的声音。
    因此，菲律宾人民对刚刚闭幕的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议给菲律宾人民指出了一条追随的道路是感激的。这样一个争取和平的会议对于菲律宾人民的长久渴望是一个回答。他们的渴望就是与亚洲和太平洋区域的人民并肩起来击败美帝国主义反和平的阴谋。他们要尽他们最大努力来为这一伟大的事业做出贡献，同时，他们期望这即将到来的会议能解决亚洲和太平洋的问题：早日终结朝鲜战争，外国干涉者从越南及马来亚撤退，取消美帝国主义为了侵略而在菲律宾所建立的一切军事设备。最后，他们期望通过这个会议能得到自由的无阻碍的文化遗产与贸易的交流。这个交流的实行将会是亚洲和太平洋各国之间将来建立互相尊敬与互相帮助的先决条件，这也是一个和平的保证。
    菲律宾人民希望这即将到来的会议获得空前未有的成功，并向对亚洲与太平洋和平战友发出号召的、以宋庆龄和郭沫若为首的中国十一位和平战士致以祝贺。
