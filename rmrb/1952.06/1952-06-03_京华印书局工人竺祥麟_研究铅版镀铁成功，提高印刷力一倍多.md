    Jinghua Printing House Worker Zhu Xianglin
    Successfully Researches Lead Plate Iron Plating, Increasing Printing Power by More Than Double
    Comrade Editor: Zhu Xianglin is a copper plating worker in the type-casting section of our Jinghua Printing House. He has a lot of experience in electroplating copper plates. He knows that now that the workers are truly in charge, they should have the attitude of being masters of their own house. He has been thinking about how to improve production and reduce costs. They originally plated red copper on lead plates, and he suggested changing to plating with strong yellow copper. However, this method was not adopted because the cost was too high and uneconomical. He was not discouraged. One day, he heard that workers at the Xinhua Printing Factory were researching iron plating. He thought that iron was very strong and the cost was low, so he decided to try it. The first iron plating he produced had pits and was not usable. He continued to study, looking for reference books and thinking of ways. With this selfless spirit, he finally succeeded in experimenting with iron plating. Now, a set of iron-plated lead plates can print more than 100,000 sheets; in the past, copper-plated lead plates could only print a maximum of 40,000 to 50,000 sheets. There are also savings in the use of raw materials. Copper costs 14,000 yuan per jin, while iron only costs 2,000 yuan per jin. This method also greatly saves the time of plate mounting, plate casting, and plate plating. Zhu Xianglin was therefore rated as a first-class labor model in our factory. His spirit of not fearing difficulties and delving into technology is worthy of our learning. Qin Ruixia

    京华印书局工人竺祥麟
    研究铅版镀铁成功，提高印刷力一倍多
    编辑同志：竺祥麟是我们京华印书局铸字课浇版间的镀铜工人，他在电镀铜版工作上有很多经验。他知道现在工人真正当了家，就应该有作主人的态度。他一直在想怎样提高生产，减低成本。他们本来在铅版上镀的是红铜，他提议改镀质量坚固的黄铜。但因成本高不合算，这个方法未被采用。他并没有灰心。有一天，他听说新华印刷厂工人正在研究镀铁。他想，铁的质量很坚硬，成本也低，决心要试验一下。他第一次镀成的铁上有麻点，不好用。他继续研究，找参考书，想办法。在这种忘我的精神下，他终于试验镀铁成功了。现在，一付镀铁的铅版可以印到十万张以上；过去镀铜的铅版最高也只能印到四、五万张。在使用原料方面也节约了，铜每斤要花一万四千元，铁每斤只需二千元。这个方法还大大节省了装版、浇版、镀版的时间。竺祥麟因此被评为我厂的一级劳动模范。他的不怕困难、钻研技术的精神，是值得我们学习的。　秦瑞侠
