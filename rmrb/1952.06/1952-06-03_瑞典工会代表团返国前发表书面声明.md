Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The Swedish trade union delegation, which came to China to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of their return home:

    After spending the most valuable thirty-eight days in New China, the first Swedish delegation to visit New China wishes to express its warm gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese people before departing for home.

    We have seen a new people, possessing indomitable revolutionary optimism and an eternally invincible confidence, because they believe in themselves and in their leadership.

    We have seen a people who resolutely support the government led by Chairman Mao Zedong, and who are willing to exert all their strength to consolidate and defend the people's regime won through decades of heroic struggle against enemies at home and abroad.

    We were warmly and sincerely welcomed by the entire Chinese people because we came here as friends willing to fight for peace and the unity of all peoples.

    The standard of living in old China was lower than in our own country. But we have seen that in the short three years since liberation, the Chinese people have rapidly restored the economy severely damaged by imperialist occupation and the reactionary Kuomintang regime, implemented land reform, carried out massive river control projects, adjusted urban and rural trade, and stabilized prices—thereby greatly improving the material and cultural life of the people.

    Our delegation, like delegations from other countries, received many wonderful gifts during our visit to People's China. The most valuable thing you gave us was the conviction that the great Chinese people stand firmly with the peoples of all countries who love peace, freedom, and progress.

    During our visit to People's China, we deeply realized how much can be accomplished if the people unite to fight for peace and social progress.

    We saw the Chinese people during festivals and at work, how jubilant they were about the great achievements made under the leadership of the people's government, and how irresistibly enthusiastic they were about implementing the political policies of the people's government.

    We would like to pay tribute to the Chinese working class, who have achieved victories in the battle to restore industry and transportation, and who are increasing production and improving productivity every day. The Chinese working class does not make significant improvements in living standards now in order to realize China's industrialization faster and lay the foundation for a happier life for all the people. This is a wise action with a high degree of political awareness.

    We pay tribute to the Chinese peasants, tens of millions of whom have left their homes to eradicate rivers that have caused disasters and famines for generations, making use of every inch of land, developing mutual aid, and increasing the yield of their land.

    We pay tribute to the Chinese youth, who are the decisive force of the new life, who consciously study with amazing perseverance, providing the country with cadres for developing industry and culture, and providing cadres for defending peace and defending the motherland.

    We pay tribute to the Chinese women, who have freed themselves from the suffering of old-fashioned marriages and are building a new life alongside men.

    We pay tribute to all Chinese cultural workers, who serve the people and have created miracles in the development of culture in the three years since liberation, giving full play to the great spiritual power of the Chinese people.

    We congratulate the Chinese children on their happy lives. The infant mortality rate in old China was very high, and there has been great improvement in this area. Among the progress made in all aspects of New China, this achievement is perhaps the greatest: tens of millions of Chinese children no longer suffer from hunger and are receiving the loving care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. Although there are still not enough nurseries, kindergartens, and schools, the work of the past three years shows that Chinese children are moving towards a bright future.

    U.S. imperialism knows the importance of people very well, and in its desperation over the failure of its war against the Korean and Chinese people, it has even used bacteriological weapons. The exhibition in Beijing on the crimes of U.S. imperialism in bacteriological warfare made us shudder to see what barbaric means the imperialist warmongers in crisis have used in their anti-people war.

    After returning to Sweden, we are determined to do everything in our power to expose the imperialist warmongers and their abominable methods. At the same time, we are deeply convinced that if the people unite against imperialism and reactionaries, we are invincible. The Chinese people provide a good example.

    Our people, in their struggle to maintain our national independence, to establish genuine people's democracy, and to strive for lasting peace, will be inspired and encouraged by the great example of the Chinese people.

### 瑞典工会代表团返国前发表书面声明

    瑞典工会代表团返国前发表书面声明
    【新华社三十日讯】来我国参加“五一”节观礼的瑞典工会代表团，在返国前夕，发表书面声明如下：
    为了我们在新中国度过的最可贵的三十八天，瑞典第一个前来新中国的代表团，在动身回国前夕，愿意向中华全国总工会和中国人民表示热烈的感谢。
    我们见到了一个新生的人民，他们抱有不屈不挠的革命的乐观主义，永远不可战胜的信心，因为他们相信自己，相信他们的领导。
    我们见到了一个坚决拥护毛泽东主席所领导的政府的人民，他们愿意尽一切力量来巩固和保卫经过数十年反抗国内外敌人的英勇斗争而取得的人民政权。
    我们受到全中国人民的热烈诚挚的欢迎，因为我们是以愿意为和平与各国人民的团结而斗争的友人的身份来到了这里的。
    旧中国的生活水平是比我们本国低的。但是我们看到，在解放以来的短短三年中，中国人民已经迅速地恢复了被帝国主义占领和国民党反动政权所严重破坏的经济，实行了土地改革，进行了巨大的治河工程，调整了城乡贸易，稳定了物价，——从而已经大大地改善了人民群众的物质文化生活。
    我们代表团，也正像别的国家的代表团一样，在访问人民中国期间接受了许多美好的礼物。你们给予我们的最宝贵的东西，就是这样一个信念：伟大的中国人民是和全世界爱好和平、自由与进步的国家的人民坚定地站在一起的。
    我们在访问人民中国期间，深深地认识到，如果人民团结起来为和平与社会进步而斗争，就能完成多么大的事业。
    我们看到了在节日中、在工作中的中国人民，他们对于在人民政权领导下取得的伟大成绩是如何欢欣鼓舞的，他们对于实现人民政府的政治方针是抱有不可自禁的热情的。
    我们谨向在恢复工业和交通的战斗中取得胜利、并且天天增加生产提高生产率的中国工人阶级致敬。中国工人阶级为了更快实现中国工业化，为了给全体人民更幸福的生活奠定基础，现在不把生活水准作重大的改善。这是一种具有高度政治觉悟的明智的行动。
    我们向中国农民致敬，他们当中有千千万万的人，离开他们的家乡，去根治世世代代来一直造成灾难和饥荒的河流，他们利用了每一寸土地，开展互助，提高他们土地的产量。
    我们向中国青年致敬，他们是新生活的决定性力量，他们自觉地以惊人的毅力学习，给国家提供发展工业和文化的干部，提供保卫和平及保卫祖国的干部。
    我们向中国妇女致敬，她们已经摆脱了旧式婚姻的痛苦，并已经和男子一样地建设着新生活。
    我们向中国全体文化工作者致敬，他们为人民服务，在解放后的三年内在发展文化方面创造了种种奇迹，发挥了中国人民的伟大的精神力量。
    我们对中国儿童的幸福生活，表示祝贺。旧中国的儿童死亡率是很高的，现在在这一方面有了很大的改善。在新中国各方面的进步当中，这方面的成绩也许是最大的了：千千万万的中国儿童已不再遭受饥饿的痛苦，并受到中国共产党和人民政府的慈爱的照顾。托儿所、幼儿园和学校虽然还不够，但是三年来的工作表明，中国儿童正朝着光辉灿烂的前途前进。
    美帝国主义很知道人的重要，在它对朝中人民的战争失败绝望之余，竟使用了细菌武器。北京举办的美帝国主义细菌战罪行展览会，使我们不寒而栗地看到，陷于危机中的帝国主义战争贩子在反人民的战争中使用了怎样野蛮的手段。
    我们回到瑞典之后，决尽我们一切力量，揭露帝国主义战争贩子和他们可憎的手段。我们同时还深深相信，人民如果团结起来反对帝国主义和反动派，我们就是不可战胜的。中国人民就提供了一个很好的榜样。
    我国人民在争取保持我国民族独立、争取建立真正人民民主以及争取持久和平的斗争中，将从中国人民的伟大榜样中得到鼓舞和勇气。
