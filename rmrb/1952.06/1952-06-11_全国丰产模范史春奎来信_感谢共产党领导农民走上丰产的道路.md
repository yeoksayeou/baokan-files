    Letter from National Model Laborer in Wheat Production, Shi Chun-kui:
    Thanks to the Communist Party for Leading Farmers onto the Path of High Yields

    To the Editor: The moment I think about being awarded the glorious title of "National Model Laborer in Wheat Production," I think of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. If it hadn't been for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to turn over a new leaf, there's no way my crops last year could have yielded 672.5 catties per mu.

    In the old society, the Chiang and Ma bandit troops were grabbing soldiers everywhere. The young and strong hid in the mountain gullies and grasslands. There was no one to do the farm work. How could we possibly produce more grain then! Even if we painstakingly managed to harvest a little grain, besides dealing with the Kuomintang's extortionate taxes and military requisitions, we still had to pay rent to the landlords. We had no choice but to mortgage our orchards and vegetable gardens.

    After liberation, I could produce in peace and stability. Chairman Mao and the People's Government were thinking of ways to help us in production in every way. Last year, wheat smut was very serious. We hadn't even noticed it yet, but the government mobilized us to quickly pull it out. This year, the government gave us medicine to treat the seeds and called on us to work hard, pull more weeds, and plow more land. They gave us loans to buy livestock and seeds. How could we farmers not be happy! How could we not produce well, and how could we not live up to the kindness of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government!

    Under the call of the People's Government, last year I plowed the land four times, weeded four times, watered three times on time, and applied 18,000 catties of manure per mu
    (before liberation, we could only plow the land twice at most, water couldn't be applied on time, and not much manure could be accumulated), removed the wheat smut, and also selected seeds. At harvest time, I yielded 672.5 catties per mu and was rewarded by the Central People's Government and governments at all levels. They held a grand meeting and awarded me the prize in public. After the meeting, government cadres and villagers performed Yangko dances and sent the prizes to my home. The villagers said, "Now it's good to work hard and produce more grain. Our own lives are better, and the government even gives rewards, just like passing the imperial examination in the past."

    This year, I responded to the government's call to "organize, increase production, and increase the yield per unit area" and joined a mutual aid team. In the future, I will definitely learn from the experiences of high-yield models and advanced mutual aid teams such as Shi Fuan and Li Shunda together with the people in the team to do a better job of farming. Our mutual aid team strives to harvest 460 catties of wheat per mu this year; to ensure that all the team's cultivated land is free from drought, frost, and pests and diseases; to ensure the careful selection of wheat seeds, thoroughly winnowed and dried, and to actively hand over patriotic public grain. This year, I applied 220 loads of manure per mu to my own land (an increase of 70 loads compared to last year), and more than 3 mu of land was top-dressed. I will strive to yield an average of 700 catties per mu on my 11.119 mu of wheat, and ensure a yield of 750 catties per mu on 1.78 mu of high-yield land.

    This time I received the award, not only I myself, but all the people of Qinghai felt honored. At the same time, it also broke the incorrect ideological concerns of some people who were afraid that "more grain would be taken away by the government." Now the villagers have truly realized that: what Chairman Mao and the People's Government say is all right; as long as we listen to Chairman Mao, work hard and produce, and study hard, not only can we live a good life ourselves, but the country will also become prosperous and strong.

    全国丰产模范史春奎来信
    感谢共产党领导农民走上丰产的道路
    编辑同志：我一想到我能获得“全国小麦丰产模范”的光荣称号，就想到共产党和毛主席。要不是共产党、毛主席领导我们翻了身，去年我的庄稼无论如何每亩也收不到六百七十二斤半。
    在旧社会里，蒋、马匪军到处抓兵，青、壮年躲避到山沟草地里去，庄稼活没人做，那时怎能多打粮食呢！就算是辛辛苦苦收下一点粮食，除了应付反动派苛捐杂税和兵马款项外，还得向地主缴地租。我们没有办法，把果树菜园都典了出去。
    解放以后，我可以安安稳稳地生产了。毛主席、人民政府处处在生产上给我们想办法。去年小麦的腥黑穗很多，我们还没有注意到，政府就发动我们赶快把它拔掉；今年政府又用药给我们拌种籽，号召我们好好地劳动，多拔草，多翻地；贷款给我们买牲口、买种籽。我们农民怎能不高兴！不去好好生产，怎能对得起毛主席、共产党和人民政府的恩情！
    我在人民政府的号召下，去年翻了四遍地，拔了四遍草，按时浇了三次水，每亩上了一万八千斤粪
    （解放前顶多翻地二遍，水不能按时浇，粪也攒不多），拔除了腥黑穗，还选了种。收麦时每亩打了六百七十二斤半，受到了中央人民政府和各级人民政府的奖励，开大会，当众给我授奖。会后政府干部和老乡们扭着秧歌将奖品送到我家里。老乡们说：“现在劳动好，多打粮，自己的日子好过，政府还有奖，好像以前中状元一样。”
    今年我响应了政府“组织起来，增加生产，提高单位面积产量”的号召，参加了互助组。我以后一定和组里的人们共同学习史福安、李顺达等丰产模范和先进互助组的经验，把庄稼做得更好。我们互助组争取今年每亩收小麦四百六十斤；保证全组耕地不受旱，不受霜打，不受病虫害；保证精选麦种，簸净晒干，积极缴纳爱国公粮。我自己的地今年每亩上了二百二十驮粪（比去年增加七十驮），有三亩多地上了追粪。十一亩一分九厘小麦，每亩争取平均打七百斤，其中一亩七分八厘丰产地，保证每亩打七百五十斤。
    我这次得了奖，不但我自己，全青海人民都觉得光荣。同时也打破了有些人怕“多打粮，叫公家拿走”的不正确的思想顾虑。现在老乡们都确实认识到：毛主席和人民政府说的话都是对的；只要听毛主席的话，好好劳动生产，努力学习，不但自己能过好日子，国家也富强起来。
