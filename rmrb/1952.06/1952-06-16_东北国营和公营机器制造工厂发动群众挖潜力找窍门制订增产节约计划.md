Northeast State-Owned and Public Machine Manufacturing Factories Mobilize the Masses to Tap Potential, Find Tricks, and Formulate Production Increase and Thrift Plans

The workers and staff of the Northeast machinery manufacturing industry, responding to Comrade Gao Gang's call to increase production and practice thrift equivalent to eight million tons of grain, have launched a movement to formulate production increase and thrift plans. Most state-owned and public factories have already put forward targets for production increase and thrift plans and have specifically distributed them to workshops, sections, and teams. Some factories have already formulated individual, team, workshop, and factory-wide plans.

The movement to formulate production increase and thrift plans was launched on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign. The production enthusiasm of all workers and staff is extremely high. Everyone is actively tapping potential, finding tricks, and repeatedly discussing production plans. The figures in the production increase and thrift plans drawn up by the factories greatly exceed the figures assigned by the higher-level leading organs. The preliminary production increase and thrift targets proposed by eleven factories in Shenyang alone exceed the tasks assigned by the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration by 49.6 percent. The figures in the production increase and thrift plan drawn up by Machine Factory No. 12 exceed the figures assigned by the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration by more than two and a half times; individual factories exceed the task by five times.

The process of formulating production increase and thrift plans is the process of mobilizing all workers and staff to find tricks and tap potential. Therefore, organizing all workers and staff to repeatedly and deeply study the relevant documents on production increase and thrift, so that they correctly understand the political and economic significance of production increase and thrift, as well as the relationship between national interests and individual interests; organizing technical personnel to go deep into the front line and combine with workers to summarize the experience of last year's production increase and thrift movement; overcoming the various conservative ideas of workers and staff, and promoting advanced experience are the keys to formulating practical and feasible production increase and thrift plans that will take production a step further. For example, when the workers of the No. 5 Team of turners in Machine Factory No. 3 formulated the production increase and thrift plan, they conducted repeated discussions, launched criticism and self-criticism, and overcame the conservative ideas of a few workers who believed that "after last year's production increase and thrift, the potential has been almost fully tapped" and "no matter how much we improve, we can't improve much more." They examined all the problems existing in the team and formulated further measures to implement high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-blade cutting methods. The whole team launched a movement to learn from advanced experience and formulated an advanced team plan that could increase the country's production by 676 tons and 480 kilograms of grain. During the formulation of the production increase and thrift plan, Machine Factory No. 2 organized a factory-wide "Trick Exhibition" to review the potential capabilities of the entire factory and launched an in-depth movement to tap potential and find tricks. Therefore, the production increase and thrift plan formulated greatly exceeded the tasks assigned by the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration.

However, the production increase and thrift plans formulated by some factories still have a tendency toward formalism. The leading cadres of these factories believe that potential is very easy to dig out, so when formulating the plan, they did not mobilize the masses to seriously study the problems existing in the enterprise, and blindly formulated the so-called "advanced" plan. And these plans lack guarantees for implementation.

There are also some factories whose plans are very conservative. Some administrative leading cadres of Machine Factory No. 3 do not understand the significance of promoting advanced experience, do not rely on the masses, exaggerate objective difficulties, worry that the plan will be "too high" and cannot be completed, or fear that some workshops or teams will set the plan too high, which may hinder the "balanced" production of the entire factory. Therefore, their plan is set low. There are also individual factory leaders who have not closely combined the organization and education of the masses to tap potential, find tricks, and formulate production increase and thrift plans, which has aroused ideological concerns among some workers. They are afraid that after the plan is improved, working hours will be shortened and wages will be reduced. Therefore, some workers have found tricks but do not propose them, preparing to take them out after the production quota is fixed. The leadership of factories and enterprises in various places must pay attention to these deviations and correct them.

### 东北国营和公营机器制造工厂发动群众挖潜力找窍门制订增产节约计划

    东北国营和公营机器制造工厂发动群众挖潜力找窍门制订增产节约计划
    东北机器制造业职工响应高岗同志提出的增产节约八百万吨粮食的号召，开展了制订增产节约计划的运动。大部分国营、公营工厂，已经提出了增产节约计划的指标，并已把它具体地分配到车间、工段和小组中去。有一部分工厂已经订出了个人的、小组的、车间的以及全厂的计划。
    制订增产节约计划运动是在“三反”运动胜利的基础上开展起来的。全体职工的生产情绪极高，大家积极挖潜力、找窍门，反复地讨论了生产计划。各厂订出来的增产节约计划中的数字，大大地超过了上级领导机关分配的数字。仅是沈阳十一个工厂初步提出的增产节约指标，就超过东北机械工业管理局分配的任务的百分之四十九点六。机器十二厂订出的增产节约计划中的数字，超过东北机械工业管理局分配数字的两倍半以上；个别工厂有超过任务五倍的。
    制订增产节约计划的过程，就是发动全体职工找窍门挖潜力的过程。因此，组织全体职工反复、深入地学习有关增产节约的文件，使他们正确地认识增产节约的政治意义和经济意义，以及国家利益和个人利益的关系；组织技术人员深入现场，和工人相结合，总结去年增产节约运动的经验；克服职工的各种保守思想，推广先进经验等，是制订切实可行的、把生产提高一步的增产节约计划的关键。比如，机器三厂车工五组工人在订立增产节约计划时，进行了反复的讨论，展开了批评和自我批评，克服了少数工人认为“经过去年增产节约，潜力挖的差不多了”、“再提高也提高不了多少”等等保守思想，检查了小组存在的一切问题，拟订了进一步实行高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法的办法。全组开展了学习先进经验运动，订出了可为国家增产六百七十六吨零四百八十公斤粮食的先进小组计划。机器二厂在订立增产节约计划期间，组织了全厂性的“窍门展览会”，检阅了全厂的潜在能力，开展了一个深入的挖潜力、找窍门运动，因而订出来的增产节约计划，大大地超过了东北机械工业管理局给予的任务。
    但是，一部分工厂制订的增产节约计划，还存在着形式主义的偏向。这些厂的领导干部认为潜力是非常容易挖掘出来的，所以在订立计划的时候，他们没有发动群众认真地研究企业中存在的问题，就盲目地订出了所谓“先进”的计划。而这些计划是缺乏实现的保证的。
    还有一些厂的计划是十分保守的。机器三厂有些行政领导干部不了解推广先进经验的意义，不依靠群众，夸大客观困难，耽心计划订得“高”了完不成，或怕某些车间或小组把计划订高了，可能妨碍全厂“均衡”生产，因此，他们的计划就订低了。还有个别工厂的负责干部，没有把组织和教育群众挖潜力、找窍门和订增产节约计划紧密地结合起来，引起了部分工人的思想顾虑。他们怕计划提高以后，就会缩短工时，降低工资；因此，有的工人找到了窍门也不提出，准备生产定额固定了再拿出来。各地工厂企业领导方面必须注意这些偏向，并加以纠正。
