    Two Cases in Grain Storage Work

    Editor: Last year, Suiyuan and Chahar provinces suffered from drought and poor harvests. The Central People's Government specially allocated a large batch of corn from the Northeast to supply the needs of the local people. However, these two regions had poor grain storage equipment, especially lacking experience in storing corn. In addition, the corn from the Northeast last year had a high moisture content, and it was easy to spoil if storage was not taken seriously. The Suiyuan Provincial Grain Company studied this situation, obtained the assistance of local people's governments at all levels, and established a grain protection command. In early February, they sent people to inspect the grain storage situation. During the inspection, it was discovered that a small amount of grain in Fengzhen and Liangcheng had spoiled. The administrative leadership department of Suiyuan Province immediately issued grain protection instructions, ordering the county magistrates of each county to be responsible for supervising and guiding the grain protection work. The Commercial Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government also sent more than 30 cadres to Suidong to assist in grain protection work. Local public security departments dispatched public security teams to assist in grain protection, and the Provincial Native Produce Company and Livestock Company promptly solved the material difficulties in grain protection work. At the same time, the grain storage department of the province mobilized the masses to participate in the work of turning over and drying grain in warehouses, paying close attention to protecting the grain. Therefore, until now, the accident grain in the Suiyuan Provincial Grain Company's inventory only accounts for 0.014% of the total inventory. However, since receiving the corn transported from the Northeast, the Chahar Provincial Grain Company, although it had conveyed and arranged grain protection work, did not have specific plans and organization from the leading cadres, and did not conduct timely and in-depth supervision and inspection. As a result, the vast majority of units did not follow the instructions of the superiors to deploy grain protection work. When the Xuanhua City Grain Company was drying wet grain in March, it only designated a few cadres such as chemists to be responsible. Some leading cadres only cared about "fighting tigers" and did not lead the grain protection work, so that the grain protection work could not be carried out in a timely manner. Therefore, up to now, the deteriorated and moldy grain accounts for more than 0.7% of the total inventory.

    The above facts show that the same quality of grain, in the same environment and season, will produce two different results due to different storage conditions. This gives a powerful answer to those who emphasize objective difficulties. Facts have proved that as long as we attach importance to storage work, closely contact the masses with the assistance of the local administrative departments, all kinds of difficulties can be overcome. I hope that the grain storage departments in various places will accept this experience and lesson, pay attention to and strengthen grain storage work, so as to avoid losses to state property.

    粮食保管工作中的两种情况
    编辑同志：去年绥远、察哈尔两省干旱成灾，粮食歉收，中央人民政府特从东北调拨大批玉米，供应当地人民需要。但这两个地区保管粮食的设备较差，尤其缺乏对保管玉米的经验，加以去年东北的玉米含水量很大，如不注意保管，很易霉坏。绥远省粮食公司研究了这种情况，取得当地各级人民政府的协助，建立了护粮指挥部，并在二月初派人检查粮食保管状况。在检查过程中，发现了丰镇、凉城有少数粮食霉坏的现象。绥远省行政领导部门马上发出护粮指示，责成各县县长负责督导，做好护粮工作。绥远省人民政府商业厅也派出三十几个干部，到绥东协助进行护粮工作，各地公安部门抽派公安队协助护粮，省土产公司和畜产公司及时解决了护粮工作上的器材的困难。同时，该省粮食保管部门发动了广大群众，参加翻仓倒晒工作，加意保护粮食。因此，直到目前为止，绥远省粮食公司存粮中的事故粮，只占存粮总数的万分之一点四。而察哈尔省粮食公司自接到东北运来的玉米以后，虽然也曾传达和布置了护粮工作，但由于领导干部没有具体计划和组织，更没有及时进行深入的督导检查，以致绝大部分单位，没有遵照上级指示，布置护粮工作。宣化市粮食公司在三月份晒潮粮时，只指定化验员等少数干部负责；还有些领导干部只顾“打虎”，不去领导护粮工作，使护粮工作不能及时开展。因此到现在为止，变质、霉坏的粮食竟占存粮总数的万分之七十以上。
    以上事实说明，同样品质的粮食，在同样的环境和季节中，由于保管的情况不同，就会产生两种不同的结果。这给了强调客观困难的人以有力的回答。事实证明，只要我们重视保管工作，在当地行政部门协助下，密切联系群众，各种困难都是可以克服的。我希望各地粮食保管部门，接受这一经验教训，注意和加强粮食保管工作，免使国家财产受到损失。之江
