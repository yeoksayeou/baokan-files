Industrial Labor Model Su Changyou
Suggests Leading Cadres Subscribe to Newspapers for Workers

Comrade Editor: The construction workers at the Harbin Engineering Office of our Northeast Construction Engineering Company cannot see the People's Daily. Only cadres here can see the People's Daily. The People's Daily publishes important national and global events, which our workers should all know. Let me give an example! When I went to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration in Poland, I saw on the second page of the People's Daily the news about Fu Hongbin's invention of the "mortar spreading tool," and I was very happy. I immediately wrote to tell the workers in my office about this new tool. Now, they are not only using the "mortar spreading tool," but also implementing the double-handed mortar squeezing method, thus greatly increasing bricklaying efficiency. From this example, we can see how much reading the newspaper every day can contribute to the progress of workers! I hope the leadership of our office will quickly subscribe to the People's Daily for us to read.

Certain Leading Cadres of Jinan Railway Factory
Should Not Have Accumulated Rationalization Proposals from the Masses for a Year

Comrade Editor: In January of last year, Lian Qiu, a technician at our Jinan Railway Factory, saw that it took six workers a full twenty-four hours to install a steam cylinder liner, and everyone was very tired. At that time, he and He Ruiheng discussed improving this manual installation method. In their spare time, they studied for three months and came up with a method of using a mobile steam cylinder liner turning machine to install the liner. If this method is adopted, efficiency can be increased twenty times, and the labor intensity of workers can be greatly reduced. Last May, they made a design sketch and instructions for this machine and submitted it to the technical section for review. After the technical section approved the sketch, it was forwarded to the production planning section. However, the production planning section did not deal with this matter for a long time. Lian Qiu asked the technical section, and the people in the technical section replied: "The production planning section does not agree to adopt it!" Lian Qiu then went to ask Liu Kejing, the chief of the production planning section, who replied: "It can probably be used." This February, the technical section took back the design sketch and instructions, and has not dealt with it until now. This January, workers Li Chengyin and Shi Mingquan also proposed an improvement to the model box. If this suggestion is adopted, work efficiency can be increased several times. Li Chengyin sent this rationalization proposal to the technical section, but the cadres of the technical section thought that the drawings made by Li Chengyin were not detailed enough and asked Li Chengyin to draw each part in detail on the drawings. Li Chengyin's drawing ability is not high, and he cannot draw such detailed drawings. As a result, this rationalization proposal was buried. Similar situations are very common in our factory. This is very harmful to our production. Our workers are very eager to engage in inventions and creations to improve our production; but our leading cadres do not pay attention to our inventions and creations, do not believe in our creative power, and do not help us solve the difficulties in inventions and creations, hindering our enthusiasm for studying technology. I hope the leading cadres of our factory will check the work on rationalization proposals and publish the results of the inspection in the newspaper.

Zhang Zhaoyi Team of Fengfeng Mining Bureau
Determined to Learn from the Advanced Experience of Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team

Comrade Editor: I am a drilling assistant worker in the Zhang Zhaoyi team of the Drilling Engineering Team of the Basic Construction Department of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. After seeing the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team published in the People's Daily, we were very excited. In the past, we always felt that drilling work could not create new records. When we heard that drilling efficiency was high elsewhere, we thought it was because the rock was soft, the geological conditions were good, and the machinery and equipment were perfect. The facts of the Ma Wenzhi team broke our conservative thinking, and the workers in our team all believed in the benefits of the Soviet big brother's rapid drilling method. We all thought about learning this good experience and making our team an advanced team, and we also made a preliminary learning plan. However, there are many difficulties in learning advanced experience, such as we do not know the experience of the Ma Wenzhi team clearly. Just when we were having difficulties, your newspaper encouraged us. All the comrades in the team immediately cheered up. We held team meetings for three consecutive days, studied the experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, and revised the patriotic convention. We are all determined to learn the rapid drilling method of the Ma Wenzhi team, improve work efficiency, and dedicate it as a gift to the Party's birthday; within half a year, we will strive to catch up with the record of the Ma Wenzhi team. Our team is all young people, and our hearts are fiery. We love science, and we are willing to humbly learn all kinds of advanced experience and work hard for the construction of the great motherland.

I was Honored to be Rated as a Model for Learning Advanced Experience

Comrade Editor: I am a member of the Communist Youth League, working in the weaving workshop of the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory. Since I earnestly studied the 1951 Weaving Method, both the output and quality of the cloth have improved. The output of a loom has increased from an average of 33 yards per day in the past to 36 yards. Off-grade cloth has decreased from three per day to one, and the sub-cloth rate has decreased by 63 percent. At the same time, our ability to watch looms has also increased from the original six looms to eight looms.

When I started to promote the 1951 Weaving Method, I thought: I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I should play a model leading role in learning. When the "little teacher" performed for us, I studied with special care. I marked the "little teacher's" patrol route in my notebook, and I learned the same way when I returned to the workshop. With the help of the "little teacher" and my own efforts, I gradually learned the 1951 Weaving Method.

When I started learning, many workers were unwilling to learn. Some said: "It's the same to weave cloth whether you learn it or not, what's the use of learning that thing." Some said: "I've been doing it for decades, and I've been doing it today without learning the 1951 Weaving Method." After hearing these reactions, I reasoned with them on the one hand, and on the other hand, I worked harder to learn, and used my learning results to influence them. Sure enough, when I increased from watching six looms to watching eight looms, many workers who were unwilling to learn were also willing to learn. Hu Guoyu was originally unwilling to learn, but now his ability to watch looms has increased from six to eight, and he has been rated by everyone as the second type of advanced producer. In May, I was honored to be rated by everyone as a model for learning advanced experience in the factory and received a reward.

Hengyang Railway Bureau Should Not Send Vehicles That Cannot be Repaired to the Factory for Repair

Comrade Editor: The Hengyang Railway Administration sent vehicles that could not be repaired to the Changxindian Railway Factory for repair, wasting freight. On May 31, the Hengyang Railway Administration sent six broken vehicle frames, requesting the Changxindian Railway Factory to repair them. According to Zhang Bowen, the person in charge of the Changxindian Railway Factory, after preliminary research, it is possible that three of these six vehicles cannot be repaired. Now the Changxindian Railway Factory still has more than 20 vehicles that cannot be repaired sent by the Hengyang Railway Administration one after another. This fact shows that the Hengyang Railway Administration is very careless in the vehicle appraisal work. The freight for more than 20 vehicles costs at least 150 million yuan, which is a great loss. I hope the relevant departments of the Hengyang Railway Administration will investigate this matter.

Employees of China Oils and Fats Corporation, Qinhuangdao Branch
Save the Country More Than 1.4 Billion Yuan

Comrade Editor: After the "Three-Anti" Movement, all employees of the Qinhuangdao Branch of China Oils and Fats Corporation improved their class consciousness and demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and creativity, completed the state's export sales tasks, and increased production and saved more than 1.4 billion yuan for the country.

After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the processing plant of this company greatly increased the quantity of processed products and improved the quality; taking the purity of exported peanut oil as an example, it increased from 93.5 percent in the past to 98.15 percent now. Due to the improvement of product quality, a certain shipment of goods to the Soviet Union increased the value of goods for the country by 1.197 billion yuan.

When purchasing goods, the company's employees adopted the method of self-operated purchase and delivery of goods to the warehouse, saving a lot of commodity circulation costs. They operated a certain commodity, and in two months saved the country a total of more than 200 million yuan in purchase handling fees, delivery and storage transportation fees, packaging fees, and sack depreciation fees. The economic value obtained due to increased production, reduced damage and consumption, and reduced costs is very large and has not yet been calculated.

Now, all employees of the company are involved in a new patriotic labor competition. Through this competition, they will definitely be able to save more wealth for the country.
