Industrial Labor Model Su Changyou
Suggests Leading Cadres Subscribe to Newspapers for Workers

Comrade Editor: The construction workers at the Harbin Engineering Office of our Northeast Construction Engineering Company cannot see the People's Daily. Only cadres here can see the People's Daily. The People's Daily publishes important national and global events, which our workers should all know. Let me give an example! When I went to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration in Poland, I saw on the second page of the People's Daily the news about Fu Hongbin's invention of the "mortar spreading tool," and I was very happy. I immediately wrote to tell the workers in my office about this new tool. Now, they are not only using the "mortar spreading tool," but also implementing the double-handed mortar squeezing method, thus greatly increasing bricklaying efficiency. From this example, we can see how much reading the newspaper every day can contribute to the progress of workers! I hope the leadership of our office will quickly subscribe to the People's Daily for us to read.

Certain Leading Cadres of Jinan Railway Factory
Should Not Have Accumulated Rationalization Proposals from the Masses for a Year

Comrade Editor: In January of last year, Lian Qiu, a technician at our Jinan Railway Factory, saw that it took six workers a full twenty-four hours to install a steam cylinder liner, and everyone was very tired. At that time, he and He Ruiheng discussed improving this manual installation method. In their spare time, they studied for three months and came up with a method of using a mobile steam cylinder liner turning machine to install the liner. If this method is adopted, efficiency can be increased twenty times, and the labor intensity of workers can be greatly reduced. Last May, they made a design sketch and instructions for this machine and submitted it to the technical section for review. After the technical section approved the sketch, it was forwarded to the production planning section. However, the production planning section did not deal with this matter for a long time. Lian Qiu asked the technical section, and the people in the technical section replied: "The production planning section does not agree to adopt it!" Lian Qiu then went to ask Liu Kejing, the chief of the production planning section, who replied: "It can probably be used." This February, the technical section took back the design sketch and instructions, and has not dealt with it until now. This January, workers Li Chengyin and Shi Mingquan also proposed an improvement to the model box. If this suggestion is adopted, work efficiency can be increased several times. Li Chengyin sent this rationalization proposal to the technical section, but the cadres of the technical section thought that the drawings made by Li Chengyin were not detailed enough and asked Li Chengyin to draw each part in detail on the drawings. Li Chengyin's drawing ability is not high, and he cannot draw such detailed drawings. As a result, this rationalization proposal was buried. Similar situations are very common in our factory. This is very harmful to our production. Our workers are very eager to engage in inventions and creations to improve our production; but our leading cadres do not pay attention to our inventions and creations, do not believe in our creative power, and do not help us solve the difficulties in inventions and creations, hindering our enthusiasm for studying technology. I hope the leading cadres of our factory will check the work on rationalization proposals and publish the results of the inspection in the newspaper.

Zhang Zhaoyi Team of Fengfeng Mining Bureau
Determined to Learn from the Advanced Experience of Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team

Comrade Editor: I am a drilling assistant worker in the Zhang Zhaoyi team of the Drilling Engineering Team of the Basic Construction Department of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau. After seeing the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team published in the People's Daily, we were very excited. In the past, we always felt that drilling work could not create new records. When we heard that drilling efficiency was high elsewhere, we thought it was because the rock was soft, the geological conditions were good, and the machinery and equipment were perfect. The facts of the Ma Wenzhi team broke our conservative thinking, and the workers in our team all believed in the benefits of the Soviet big brother's rapid drilling method. We all thought about learning this good experience and making our team an advanced team, and we also made a preliminary learning plan. However, there are many difficulties in learning advanced experience, such as we do not know the experience of the Ma Wenzhi team clearly. Just when we were having difficulties, your newspaper encouraged us. All the comrades in the team immediately cheered up. We held team meetings for three consecutive days, studied the experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, and revised the patriotic convention. We are all determined to learn the rapid drilling method of the Ma Wenzhi team, improve work efficiency, and dedicate it as a gift to the Party's birthday; within half a year, we will strive to catch up with the record of the Ma Wenzhi team. Our team is all young people, and our hearts are fiery. We love science, and we are willing to humbly learn all kinds of advanced experience and work hard for the construction of the great motherland.

I was Honored to be Rated as a Model for Learning Advanced Experience

Comrade Editor: I am a member of the Communist Youth League, working in the weaving workshop of the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory. Since I earnestly studied the 1951 Weaving Method, both the output and quality of the cloth have improved. The output of a loom has increased from an average of 33 yards per day in the past to 36 yards. Off-grade cloth has decreased from three per day to one, and the sub-cloth rate has decreased by 63 percent. At the same time, our ability to watch looms has also increased from the original six looms to eight looms.

When I started to promote the 1951 Weaving Method, I thought: I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I should play a model leading role in learning. When the "little teacher" performed for us, I studied with special care. I marked the "little teacher's" patrol route in my notebook, and I learned the same way when I returned to the workshop. With the help of the "little teacher" and my own efforts, I gradually learned the 1951 Weaving Method.

When I started learning, many workers were unwilling to learn. Some said: "It's the same to weave cloth whether you learn it or not, what's the use of learning that thing." Some said: "I've been doing it for decades, and I've been doing it today without learning the 1951 Weaving Method." After hearing these reactions, I reasoned with them on the one hand, and on the other hand, I worked harder to learn, and used my learning results to influence them. Sure enough, when I increased from watching six looms to watching eight looms, many workers who were unwilling to learn were also willing to learn. Hu Guoyu was originally unwilling to learn, but now his ability to watch looms has increased from six to eight, and he has been rated by everyone as the second type of advanced producer. In May, I was honored to be rated by everyone as a model for learning advanced experience in the factory and received a reward.

Hengyang Railway Bureau Should Not Send Vehicles That Cannot be Repaired to the Factory for Repair

Comrade Editor: The Hengyang Railway Administration sent vehicles that could not be repaired to the Changxindian Railway Factory for repair, wasting freight. On May 31, the Hengyang Railway Administration sent six broken vehicle frames, requesting the Changxindian Railway Factory to repair them. According to Zhang Bowen, the person in charge of the Changxindian Railway Factory, after preliminary research, it is possible that three of these six vehicles cannot be repaired. Now the Changxindian Railway Factory still has more than 20 vehicles that cannot be repaired sent by the Hengyang Railway Administration one after another. This fact shows that the Hengyang Railway Administration is very careless in the vehicle appraisal work. The freight for more than 20 vehicles costs at least 150 million yuan, which is a great loss. I hope the relevant departments of the Hengyang Railway Administration will investigate this matter.

Employees of China Oils and Fats Corporation, Qinhuangdao Branch
Save the Country More Than 1.4 Billion Yuan

Comrade Editor: After the "Three-Anti" Movement, all employees of the Qinhuangdao Branch of China Oils and Fats Corporation improved their class consciousness and demonstrated a high degree of work enthusiasm and creativity, completed the state's export sales tasks, and increased production and saved more than 1.4 billion yuan for the country.

After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the processing plant of this company greatly increased the quantity of processed products and improved the quality; taking the purity of exported peanut oil as an example, it increased from 93.5 percent in the past to 98.15 percent now. Due to the improvement of product quality, a certain shipment of goods to the Soviet Union increased the value of goods for the country by 1.197 billion yuan.

When purchasing goods, the company's employees adopted the method of self-operated purchase and delivery of goods to the warehouse, saving a lot of commodity circulation costs. They operated a certain commodity, and in two months saved the country a total of more than 200 million yuan in purchase handling fees, delivery and storage transportation fees, packaging fees, and sack depreciation fees. The economic value obtained due to increased production, reduced damage and consumption, and reduced costs is very large and has not yet been calculated.

Now, all employees of the company are involved in a new patriotic labor competition. Through this competition, they will definitely be able to save more wealth for the country.

    建议领导干部为工人订阅报纸
    编辑同志：我们东北建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处的建筑工人看不到人民日报。我们这里只有干部才能看到人民日报。人民日报登载着全国、全世界的大事，我们工人都应该知道。我举一个例子吧！这次我经过北京到波兰去参加“五一”国际劳动节时，看到人民日报第二版上刊载着傅鸿宾创造“铺灰工具”的消息，心里非常高兴。我急忙把这个新工具写信告诉我处工人。现在，他们不仅使用了“铺灰工具”，而且更实行了双手挤浆法，因此砌砖效率大大提高。从这个例子可以看出，每天阅报，对工人的进步能起多大作用！希望我处领导方面迅速订阅人民日报给我们看。

    济南铁路工厂某些领导干部
    不该积压群众合理化建议达一年之久
    编辑同志：去年一月，我们济南铁路工厂的技术员连裘看见工人安装汽缸衬套，六个人用整整二十四小时的时间才安装一个，大家还非常累。当时他就和贺瑞恒商量改善这种人工的安装方法。他们在业余时间，研究了三个月，想出了利用移动式汽缸衬套镟削机来安装衬套的办法。如果采用这个办法，可以提高效率二十倍，而且可以大大地减轻工人的劳动强度。去年五月，他们做出了关于这一机器的设计草图和说明书，送给技术科审查。技术科批准这一草图以后，就转给生产计划科。但生产计划科在很长时间没有处理这件事。连裘追问技术科，技术科的人答复说：“生产计划科不同意采用！”连裘又去问生产计划科，生产计划科刘克敬科长答复：“大概可以用。”今年二月，技术科又把设计草图和说明书要回去，一直到现在还没有处理。今年一月，工友李成银和史铭泉又提出了改进模型盒的建议。如果采用这个建议，可以提高工作效率好几倍。李成银把这个合理化建议送给技术科，技术科的干部认为李成银画的图样不仔细，叫李成银把每个零件都在图样上画出来。李成银画图的能力不高，不能画那样仔细的图。结果这个合理化建议就被埋没了。类似这样的情况，我们工厂还很多。这对于我们的生产是非常有害的。我们工人很想搞发明创造，来提高我们的生产；但是我们的领导干部却不重视我们的发明创造，不相信我们的创造力量，不帮助我们解决发明创造中的困难，妨碍了我们钻研技术的积极性。我希望我们工厂的领导干部检查一下关于合理化建议的工作，并且把检查的结果在报纸上公布。

    峰峰矿务局张照义小组
    决心学习马文志钻探小组先进经验
    编辑同志：我是峰峰矿务局基本建设处钻探工程队张照义小组的钻探助理工人。看到人民日报登载的马文志钻探小组的先进经验后，我们非常兴奋。过去，我们老觉得钻探工作没法创造新纪录。听说别处的钻进效率高，我们就认为那是因为岩石软，地质情况好和机器设备完善。马文志小组的事实打破了我们的保守思想，我们组里的工友们都相信了苏联老大哥的快速钻进法的好处。我们都想着要学习这个好经验，使我们小组成为先进小组，我们并且作了一个初步的学习计划。可是要学习先进经验是有很多困难的，比如我们对马文志小组的经验就知道得不清楚。正在我们有困难的时候，你们的报纸鼓励了我们。全小组的同志马上都振作起来。我们连着开了三天小组会，研究了马文志小组的经验，重新修订了爱国公约。我们都下了决心，要学习马文志小组的快速钻进法，提高工作效率，作为给党的生日的献礼；在半年内，我们要努力赶上马文志小组的纪录。我们小组都是青年人，我们的心都是火热的。我们爱科学，我们愿意虚心学习各种先进经验，为伟大的祖国的建设事业而努力。

    我光荣地被评为学习先进经验的模范
    编辑同志：我是一个青年团员，在东北瓦房店纺织厂织布车间工作。自从我认真学习了一九五一织布工作法以后，布的产量、质量都提高了。一台布机的产量已由过去每日平均产三十三码提高到产三十六码。等外布由每天三个减少到一个，次布率减少了百分之六十三。同时，我们的看台能力也由原看六台织布机增加到看八台。
    在开始推广一九五一织布工作法时，我就想：我是个青年团员，应在学习中起模范带头作用。当“小先生”表演给我们看时，我就特别用心学。“小先生”巡回的路线，我都把它划在笔记本上，回到车间里就照样学。在“小先生”帮助和我自己努力下，我逐渐学会了一九五一织布工作法。
    在开始学习时，有许多工人不愿意学。有的说：“学不学一样织布，学那玩艺干啥。”有的说：“我干了好几十年了，没学一九五一织布工作法也干到今天。”听到这些反映后，我就一面讲道理给他们听，一面自己更加倍努力学习，拿学习的成绩影响他们。果然，当我由看六台布机提高到看八台时，许多不愿意学习的工人也愿意学了。胡国玉原来不愿意学，现在他的看台能力已由六台提高到八台，又被大家评为第二类型的先进生产者。五月份，我光荣地被大家评为全厂学习先进经验的模范，并得到了奖励。  孙士守述

    衡阳铁路局不应把不能修理的车辆送到工厂修理
    编辑同志：衡阳铁路管理局把不能修理的车辆送到长辛店铁路工厂修理，浪费了运费。五月三十一日，衡阳铁路管理局送来六辆破损车的车架，要求长辛店铁路工厂修理。据长辛店铁路工厂负责人张博文初步研究，在这六辆车中可能有三辆车不能修理。现在长辛店铁路工厂还存着先后由衡阳铁路管理局送来的二十多辆不能修理的车。这一事实，说明衡阳铁路管理局对于车辆鉴定工作是非常马虎的。二十多辆车的运费最低要一亿五千万元，这是很大的损失。我希望衡阳铁路管理局有关部门检查这一事件。  郭中霞
    中国油脂公司秦皇岛分公司职工
    为国家节省财富十四亿余元
    编辑同志：中国油脂公司秦皇岛分公司全体职工经过“三反”运动，阶级觉悟提高，发挥了高度的工作积极性和创造性，完成了国家出口外销任务，并给国家增产节约十四亿余元。
    这个公司的加工厂在“三反”运动以后，加工产品数量大增，质量提高；只就出口花生油纯度一项来说，即由过去百分之九十三点五提高到现在的百分之九十八点一五。由于产品质量提高，某一次运往苏联的商品，即为国家增加货物价值十一亿九千七百万元。
    该公司职工们，在收购商品时采用了自营收购、货物送库的办法节省了大量商品流转费用。他们经营一种商品，在两个月里就为国家节省了收购手续费、送库运杂费、包装费、麻袋折旧费等共两亿余元。因产品增加、伤耗降低、费用减少等获得的经济价值为数很大，还未计算在内。
    现在，该公司的全体职工都卷入新的爱国主义劳动竞赛，通过这次竞赛，一定能为国家节约更多的财富。  张秉谦
