    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 22nd: At the Korean armistice negotiations delegate conference on the 22nd, our chief representative General Nam Il pointed out: Our plan to repatriate prisoners of war home fully complies with the 1949 Geneva Convention, is fair and reasonable to both sides, and is a plan that can truly solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. The other side's plan to detain prisoners of war directly violates the Geneva Convention, is unreasonable, unfair, and cannot solve the prisoner of war repatriation issue. If the other side is truly sincere in reaching an armistice in Korea, it must withdraw its claim to detain prisoners of war and take our plan as a reasonable basis for actually resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:
    "Sincerity for peace must be demonstrated by actions. In order to achieve peace in Korea, our side has made many major efforts on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and has proposed a reasonable compromise plan based on the agreement that both sides guarantee that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War so that they can return home to live peaceful lives. All foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, captured personnel of the United Nations forces or the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be repatriated home; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, that is, captured personnel of the South Korean army or the Korean People's Army, whose homes are in the area originally belonging to one side, should be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in the area where they are being held may be allowed to return home locally without being repatriated. Our plan fully complies with the basic provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention, is fair to both sides, and is a plan that can truly solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. Your side's April 28th plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war completely violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention. No distortion or fabrication, no misinterpretation or sophistry, can change this fact. The 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated without delay after the armistice, but your side insists on detaining prisoners of war. The 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war shall not, under any circumstances, renounce the rights conferred by the Geneva Convention, but your side attempts to deprive prisoners of war of their right to repatriation under the pretext of so-called 'screening' and 're-screening'. The humanitarian principle for prisoners of war is to treat prisoners of war leniently during the war and to repatriate them after the armistice, which is the basis of the Geneva Convention. There is no humanitarian principle in the world that persecutes, slaughters, or detains prisoners of war. Your side's April 28th plan is unreasonable, unfair, and cannot solve the prisoner of war repatriation issue. Our side has resolutely rejected your side's April 28th plan. The prisoner of war repatriation issue must be resolved fairly and reasonably on the basis of the Geneva Convention. If your side wants peace, it is not just empty talk. If your side is truly sincere in reaching an armistice in Korea, your side has no reason to refuse to accept our May 2nd plan as a reasonable basis for actually resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue."

    在二十二日朝鲜谈判双方代表团大会上
    我重申解决遣俘问题的合理方案
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：我方遣返战俘回家的方案完全符合于一九四九年日内瓦公约，对双方公平合理，是真正能够解决战俘遣返问题的方案。对方扣留战俘的方案直接违反了日内瓦公约，是不合理的、不公平的、不能解决战俘遣返问题的。如果对方确有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，就必须撤回扣留战俘的主张，以我方方案为实际解决战俘遣返问题的合理基础。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “和平的诚意必须要由行动来表现。为了实现朝鲜的和平，我方在战俘遣返问题上作了多次重大的努力，并根据双方保证战俘不再参加朝鲜战争，以便回家过和平生活的协议，提出了合理折衷的方案。双方所俘获的外国武装人员，即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员，即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员，其家在原属一方地区者，全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者，可以许其就地回家，不必遣返。我方方案完全符合于一九四九年日内瓦公约的基本规定，对双方公平，是真正能够解决战俘遣返问题的方案。你方强行扣留战俘的四月二十八日方案，彻底地违反了日内瓦公约的规定，任何歪曲和捏造，任何曲解和诡辩，都不能更改这一事实。一九四九年日内瓦公约明确规定，停战后战俘应予释放与遣返，不得迟延，而你方却主张扣留战俘。一九四九年日内瓦公约明确规定战俘在任何情况下都不得声明放弃日内瓦公约所赋予的权利，而你方却企图假借所谓‘甄别’和‘再甄别’的藉口，剥夺战俘的遣返权利。对于战俘的人道原则，就是在战争期间宽待战俘，在停战以后遣返战俘，这也就是日内瓦公约的基础。世界上没有任何迫害屠杀和扣留战俘的人道原则。你方四月二十八日的方案是不合理的、不公平的、不能解决战俘遣返问题的。我方已经断然拒绝了你方四月二十八日的方案。战俘遣返问题必须在日内瓦公约的基础上求得公平合理的解决。如果你方要和平不是一句空话。如果你方确有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，你方就没有任何理由拒绝接受我方五月二日的方案作为实际解决战俘遣返问题的合理基础。”
