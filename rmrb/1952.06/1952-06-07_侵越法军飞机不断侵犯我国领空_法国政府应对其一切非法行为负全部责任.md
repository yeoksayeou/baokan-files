Xinhua News Agency, June 6th:

	Since the statement issued by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 23, 1950, regarding the armed provocations by French land and air forces along the Sino-Vietnamese border and their frequent bombing and strafing across the border, the French aggressors, disregarding our solemn protests, have intensified their command of invading Vietnamese military aircraft, continuously intruding into our airspace, and carrying out provocative acts such as bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance. In the seventeen months from December 1950 to April 1952, French aircraft continuously violated our airspace in 193 batches, totaling 286 aircraft, killing and wounding eight of our residents.

	The armed provocative acts of the French aggressors have directly caused losses to the lives and property of our people. On February 16, 1951, a French aircraft strafed Shanggou Village, Fangcheng County, Guangdong Province, with machine guns, firing over a hundred rounds, killing one daughter of our resident Tang Donghua on the spot and seriously injuring an old woman. On May 17 of the same year, a French aircraft strafed Shuikouguan, Guangxi Province, wounding one resident and destroying six houses. On November 3 of the same year, two French aircraft strafed northwest of Nancangyuan, Mengding, Yunnan Province, seriously injuring one of our residents. On April 16, 1952, a French aircraft intruded into Hebei Township, Cooperation Village, Lijiang County, Guangxi Province, and strafed, wounding four of our residents. On the same day, a French aircraft bombed and strafed at the junction of Jingxi, Guangxi Province, and Vietnam.

	French aircraft have also repeatedly airdropped weapons and ammunition to support the Kuomintang remnants on the Sino-Vietnamese border. On January 6, 1951, French aircraft airdropped forty machine guns, eleven 60mm mortars, and five mortars to the remnants on the Sino-Vietnamese border. On February 5 of the same year, French aircraft airdropped sixteen boxes of ammunition to support the bandit troops.

	People here express great indignation at the hostile acts of French imperialism in repeatedly infringing upon our territorial airspace sovereignty and undermining international law. The French government should bear full responsibility for all illegal crimes of invading our airspace and the consequences of damaging the lives and property of our people.

    侵越法军飞机不断侵犯我国领空
    法国政府应对其一切非法行为负全部责任
    【新华社六日讯】自从一九五零年十一月二十三日我国外交部发言人为中越边境法国陆空部队对我武装挑衅并经常越境轰炸扫射事发表声明后，法国侵略者不顾我国的严正抗议，竟变本加厉地指挥它的侵越军用飞机，不断侵入我国领空，施行投弹、扫射和侦察等挑衅行为。自一九五零年十二月至一九五二年四月的十七个月中，法国飞机连续侵犯我国领空达一百九十三批、二百八十六架，打死打伤我居民八人。
    法国侵略者的武装挑衅行为直接造成了我国人民生命与财产的损失。一九五一年二月十六日，法国飞机一架在广东省防城县山沟村用机枪扫射百余发，当场打死我居民汤东华的女儿一人，并重伤老妇一人。同年五月十七日，法国飞机一架在广西省水口关扫射，打伤居民一人，并毁屋六间。同年十一月三日，法国飞机两架在云南省孟定南沧源西北扫射，重伤我居民一人。一九五二年四月十六日，法国飞机一架侵入我广西省丽江县河北乡合作村扫射，打伤我居民四人。同日，一架法机在广西省靖西与越南交界处投弹扫射。
    法国飞机并曾多次空投武器弹药接济在中越边境的国民党残匪。一九五一年一月六日，法国飞机在中越边境给残匪空投机枪四十挺、六○炮十一门、迫击炮五门。同年二月五日，法国飞机又空投子弹十六箱接济匪军。
    此间人士对法国帝国主义这种一再侵害我国领空领土主权，破坏国际公法的敌对行为表示极大愤怒。法国政府应对其侵犯我领空的一切非法罪行及其损害我国人民生命财产的后果担负全部责任。
