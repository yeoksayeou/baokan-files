Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Deputy Minister Zhang Kewei

The 43rd article of the Common Program states: "Strive to develop natural sciences to serve industrial and agricultural and national defense construction." This clearly points out the important position of agricultural science and technology in the construction of a New Democratic country. I am a natural scientist and also a person directly participating in the leadership of agricultural production in the Northeast. I would like to offer some opinions on the current state of agricultural science and technology in the Northeast.

(I) The Complexity, Rigor, and Interrelatedness of Agricultural Science and Technology

Agricultural science and technology is an important branch of natural science. The subjects it studies and the scope it covers are quite broad and complex, including at least the scientific issues of climate and meteorology, geology and soil, plants and animals, bacteria and insects, physics and chemistry, physiology and ecology, pathology and medicine, heredity and variation, as well as mathematics. The study of these issues must always and everywhere be related to the issues of manpower, power, and current equipment for realizing agricultural science and technology in a specific environment. Correct and in-depth research on these sciences and technologies from a dialectical materialist point of view, and their specific application, is the most effective concrete guarantee for increasing agricultural production and increasing yields, and is a weapon for removing obstacles on the road to agricultural production progress. If this science is lacking, or if it cannot be correctly grasped and applied from a dialectical materialist point of view, then the conservative and empirical old methods of farming passed down from generation to generation for thousands of years will not be broken. In other words, without the rebirth of proletarian agricultural science and technology, those corrupt old things will not die. Because production technology develops based on the mode of production, it is a living thing, and some old methods are always replaced by newly discovered methods. Therefore, the character of agricultural science and technology has three basic characteristics: first, the multifaceted and complexity of its content and subjects; second, the high degree of rigor in the requirements of technical operations; and third, the interconnectedness of various direct or indirect factors. We must deeply understand its characteristics and master its properties in order to achieve the goal of correctly applying agricultural science and technology and improving agricultural production; otherwise, we will make mistakes. In fact, some people do not understand or do not fully understand the breadth of agricultural science and technology and the complexity of its content. They think that agricultural technology is "rough work" and can be easily compromised, or that growing crops is simple, something that "stupid people" do and can be learned at a glance. They neglect the strict requirements of science and technology when engaging in technical work and carelessly operate casually. This kind of thinking and working method is very wrong and also very dangerous.

A Chinese folk saying goes: "It takes three years to learn to be a businessman, but a lifetime to learn half a farmer." It also says: "Farming is as rough as a water tank, and as fine as a hair." These few sentences fully reflect that the people have experienced the complexity and refinement of agricultural technology from thousands of years of life and labor. These sentences contain profound truths. Because agricultural production itself is complex and refined, it is a work that involves various factors interacting and combining over several seasons to produce results. Therefore, it is determined that its character is complex, rigorous, and interrelated. If this character is not grasped, the result is that the technology is unscientific; if this technology is used in agricultural production, it will cause losses or have adverse effects. In terms of the rigor of science, it is very strict about the requirements of conditions such as matching quantities, temperature, and time, and cannot be dealt with carelessly, arbitrarily changed, or done casually. It's like: water is a compound of two hydrogens and one oxygen. If it is changed to two hydrogens and two oxygens, it will be synthesized into hydrogen peroxide for disinfection, not ordinary water; water is a liquid at general temperatures above zero degrees, if the temperature drops below zero it will become a solid, and above the boiling point, it will become a gas. Chicken eggs can only turn into chicks at a certain temperature, humidity, and time. If you arbitrarily change its strict requirements in science and technology, you will not be able to hatch chicks. This truth of the rigor of science and technology can be found in everything at any time. However, some people always ignore this truth and have made many mistakes as a result. For example, in March of this year, Xu Zhaodong, a technician from the Songjiang Province Agricultural and Forestry Department, helped the masses in Fujin County to carry out wheat seed disinfection using the "cold water warm bath soaking method." At that time, he simply wanted to "complete the soaking task within a certain time" and completely ignored the strict requirements of scientific and technological operating procedures. Originally, the correct operation of "cold water warm bath soaking" is to first soak the seeds in cold water (the soaking time must also be determined according to the temperature of the cold water), then take them out and put them in 50-degree warm water to soak for two to three minutes, then take them out of the 50-degree warm water and immediately put them in 55-degree warm water to soak for five minutes, take them out and then put them in cold water to cool, and then dry them before planting. This technical operation is strict with the requirements of temperature and time, must be accurately executed, the time cannot be too long or too short, and the temperature cannot be too high or too low. However, Xu Zhaodong completely made a mistake on this key issue. As a result, it not only caused the loss of destroying 73,000 catties of "Nonglin No. 3" excellent wheat seeds, but also had a negative impact on the technical promotion work. For example, this year, when Yang Huimin, a technician from the Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture's Pest and Disease Section, guided the masses in Shuangcheng to disinfect seeds using the "constant temperature soaking method," he learned from Xu Zhaodong's lesson of having problems with soaking wheat seeds due to excessive temperature and said to the promoters: "The temperature should be lower to avoid problems." As a result, the promoters lowered the temperature to below 44 degrees, violated the strict scientific requirements, and completely failed. To give another typical example: In 1948, about 20% of the apple trees in Liaodong Province suffered from rot disease. In recent years, as a result of using scientific and technological prevention and control, the number of diseased branch trees has been greatly reduced. For example, the apple trees in the Detaisi Village Fruit Tree Cooperative in Fuxian County had more than 20% of the trees suffering from rot disease three years ago. After correctly using scientific and technological prevention and control, the disease has now been eliminated (according to inspection, there are only three diseased branch trees out of 15,000 trees); however, in Huatong District of Fuxian County and Xihe District of Gaiping County in Lushun City, the apple rot disease is still very serious because the prevention and control was not carried out according to the strict requirements of science and technology. In particular, the apple rot disease in Yazui Village of Lushun City has developed, and now more than 50% of the apple trees in the village have rot disease. Therefore, we must correctly use agricultural science and technology in accordance with the strict requirements of science in order to achieve results, especially for the time, quantity, quality, temperature, humidity, and matching ratio required by agricultural technology, which must be correctly grasped.

Let me explain the issue of the correlation of scientific and technological factors. From the perspective of the factors required for plant growth, light, heat, nutrients, and water are the four main factors for plant growth. Experiments on the quantitative correlation of these factors in plant growth have been carried out many times before. The German Hellriegel had already done such an experiment on the relationship between plants and water: eight pots of equal size were filled with equal weights of the same soil, so that the volume occupied by the soil in the pots was equal, and carefully selected barley seeds from the same source and germination rate were sown. The only difference between the pots was the water content. He kept the moisture content of each pot at 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the original water holding capacity. The weight of each pot was measured twice a day, morning and evening, and the amount of water evaporated was supplemented by irrigation. The moisture content of each pot remained unchanged during the plant growth period. After the barley matured, the yield of each pot was: almost no harvest with 5% water content, a lot of yield with 10% water content, and the yield increased with the increase of water content, reaching the highest yield at 60% water content, the yield decreased with 80% water content, and no harvest with 100% water content. This is a typical example of the unscientific experiments of many bourgeois agriculturalists who disregarded the correlation of various factors in plant growth. Based on the results of such experiments, they put forward the so-called "law of maximum, minimum, and appropriate amount," believing that the factors of plant growth can only obtain the highest yield when they exist in an appropriate amount, and that too much or too little is not suitable. This is the "theoretical" basis for their advocacy of the "law of diminishing soil fertility." Lenin first paid attention to this issue. After conducting research in various aspects, he gave this wrong law
——"the law of diminishing soil fertility" a thorough criticism. Lenin said: "Bourgeois scientists have come up with this law in order to deceive capitalists about the obstacles to agricultural improvement. Because continuing to increase the factors of plant growth and reducing the yield is not the result of a law, but the inevitable result of neglecting the basic scientific law that requires all agricultural factors to be linked together in agriculture. That is to say, light, heat, nutrients, and water are equally important for plant growth, and the lack of one cannot be replaced by adding more of another." Based on Lenin's instructions, Wollny used dialectical materialist scientific methods to experiment with the results of the correlation of plant yield factors, and further confirmed that the "law of diminishing soil fertility" is not in line with the actual situation of agricultural production, and this law does not exist in nature. In fact, the phenomenon of diminishing yield mentioned by bourgeois scientists is due to the inaccessibility of the law of equal importance of all plant growth factors. This points out how important it is to recognize and master the factor correlation of agricultural science and technology. However, on this point, many of us still make principle errors. For example, the Kaiyuan County San Taizi Village Collective Farm is said to have planted wheat on land flooded by river water this year, applying 300 catties of ammonium sulfate per hectare (the original plan was to apply 600 catties), and 1,200 catties of soybean cake; however, they did not supplement the combined use of phosphate fertilizer and potash fertilizer. As a result, the wheat grew excessively in stems and leaves, with few seeds, and after the effective nitrogen and sulfuric acid were separated, the free sulfuric acid damaged the crops and the soil. For example, the breeding farm's feeding of stallions cannot always be given appropriate complete feed, either the water carbohydrate is high (sorghum, etc.) or the protein is too much, or the green fodder (radishes, etc.) is insufficient, and the exercise is not enough, so that the stallions are not strong during the mating period and the survival rate of sperm is not high. As for planting land, only paying attention to factors such as seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and disease and insect control, while paying insufficient attention to cultivation methods, timely sowing and weeding, mastering rainfall, sunshine hours, terrain height, and crop rotation, etc., so that the realization of maximum yield is affected. This reflects that we still do not understand the truth of the factor correlation of agricultural science and technology. To solve this problem, we must strengthen the study of materialist dialectical scientific theory, and absorb the successful experience of the Stakhanov movement in socialist agricultural production, closely combine the various factors of agricultural production, master their correlation, and accelerate the improvement of agricultural productivity and increase the harvest, which has become an important practical task in current agricultural science and technology.

(II) Several Issues in Agricultural Science and Technology Work in the Northeast

Due to the correct leadership of the central and Northeast Party and government leading organs, and due to the efforts of technical workers and the vast number of farmers, especially the lead of labor models and activists, agricultural science and technology work in the Northeast has made considerable achievements in recent years. The total value of agricultural production has exceeded the peak level of the puppet Manchukuo in 1943 by 10.5%. The yield per unit area has also exceeded the highest yield of 1943 by 6.7%. However, many shortcomings have also been exposed in the work. In order to overcome the shortcomings, after the "Three-Anti" movement, Vice Chairman Lin Feng instructed us: "We should sum up several experiences from the 'Three-Anti' movement, ... find the 'troubles' that occurred in the past work and their causes, so that after detailed analysis and research, we can propose improvement plans one by one in a planned and step-by-step manner." This is a very clear and specific instruction, and it is a major education for me. I want to conduct an in-depth inspection based on this instruction; at the same time, I hope that every agricultural worker will conduct a serious and thorough self-examination, which will be of great benefit to the development of future agricultural construction work.

Now I will briefly describe several deviations that I have seen in the process of participating in the leadership of agricultural production in the Northeast in terms of "grasping and applying agricultural science and technology," and several issues that I have initially learned based on these deviations:

1. There is a phenomenon of eagerness for quick success in the work, neglecting the maturity of technology and the coordination of objective conditions. For example, in 1950, Jilin Province reluctantly mobilized farmers to sow more than 100,000 hectares of winter wheat, but because the technical conditions were not met, they were only eager for quick success, and thus suffered failure. The masses called winter wheat "frozen wheat." In the same year, the province also promoted a large number of "high-level soil cultivation and weeding plows," but because they did not carefully consider whether the technical design conditions were mature, they blindly pushed down 14,000 units in a hasty manner. As a result, the agricultural tools were not easy to use, and the masses called the soil cultivation and weeding plow "loss-making seedling weeding plow" and refused to use them. The reason why the serious error incident of Xu Zhaodong destroying more than 70,000 catties of wheat seeds occurred in Songjiang Province this year is that Xu Zhaodong certainly made mistakes in technical operation, but the provincial agricultural leading organs' mastery and application of technical conditions and equipment conditions were not cautious and thorough enough, and eagerness for quick success was another reason for causing the "Xu Zhaodong error incident."

2. Ignoring the rigor and regionality of agricultural science and technology has resulted in repeated serious errors in this area. In 1950, Liaodong Province promoted the "Xiong Yue rake," but failed because it did not pay attention to regionality and promoted it everywhere indiscriminately. In 1949, Tieling indiscriminately promoted "double-hearted sticks" sorghum, but as a result, the yield was reduced. In 1950, Longjiang County blindly promoted "Changchun No. 3" sorghum, resulting in a reduction of two stones of grain per hectare. In 1950, the Liaodong Province Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Team used blood from cattle with anthrax and mixed anthrax bacteria in the process of carrying out cattle plague prevention in Zhuanghe County due to sloppy operation technology, killing 70 head of cattle. In the same year, when the Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture carried out cattle lung plague injection, a small number of cattle died and most of the cattle's tails rotted due to the use of untrained live bacteria and improper injection site. In addition, the Northeast Veterinary Epidemic Institute produced serum with a small number of miscellaneous bacteria and became waste products due to imprecise operation technology.

3. Lack of organizational planning and insufficient division of labor and cooperation, with each doing their own thing. There are also many such erroneous events. In the agricultural tool reform work in 1950, many areas promoted agricultural tools such as "United No. shovel tilling machines" without the approval of higher authorities, resulting in heavy losses. When the Northeast Agricultural College built the Chemistry and Biology Museum, it lacked careful planning in advance, and only after the project was completed did it find that electric hot water pipes were not installed. The Xiongyue Farm has Clydesdale stallions, and the Tieling Livestock Farm has the same kind of ewes. Neither farm was willing to rationally transfer the sheep, but insisted on the interests of its own farm, did not cooperate with each other, and each did its own thing, which affected the experimental breeding of excellent sheep. The Jinzhou Agricultural Experiment Station has "Jinyu No. 5" excellent cotton seeds. Because some people in the station have conservative ideas and are unwilling to provide them for research elsewhere, it also hinders the breeding and reproduction of good cotton.

4. Shortsightedness, only looking at the present, not the future, and failing to thoroughly criticize unscientific old technologies. For example, in some steep slopes and forest lands in the Luda area, the land has been reduced to the point where it is "not worth the loss" due to indiscriminate logging and reclamation over the years. Not only has the phenomenon of "abandoning wasteland" occurred, but it has also aggravated the harm of mountain floods. In 1949, when three kinds of excellent wheat seeds were shipped in from the Soviet Union, the trade and transportation unit that received the batch of wheat seeds only saw the current interests of its own unit, but did not see the great value of the propagation and promotion of excellent wheat seeds for future agricultural production. As a result, the wheat seeds were completely mixed up for the sake of thousands of hemp bags, causing irreparable losses. At present, some farmers are still blindly using those backward technologies
——such as "soybean oil seed mixing," "pig head meat fertilization," and "rope-pulling wheat rust," etc., and we have not thoroughly criticized them based on the dialectical materialist agricultural science principles, or replaced these unscientific and corrupt old technologies with new agricultural science and technology.

I should first conduct a self-examination for the existence of the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors. But I also hope that comrades who directly lead agricultural science and technology work and comrades who actually participate in this work will conduct a thorough inspection and sum up the experience and lessons so as to improve future work.

(III) What Should Be Done in the Future

Regarding the issue of correctly applying agricultural science and technology in the future, my initial personal opinion is: fully grasp the character of science and technology, conduct a major work inspection based on the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Feng in light of the current problems in the work, so that agricultural science and technology work can overcome conservatism, empiricism, and the view of political and technical opposition under the guidance of a high degree of political thought, and achieve the following points:

1. Provincial and county agricultural leading organs and all agricultural staff should promote agricultural science and technology in a planned and step-by-step manner under "unified planning and unified leadership," strictly adhere to the organization and discipline of work, and prevent and correct the practices of disregarding the overall plan, not planning in advance, rushing to do things in a hurry, or not cooperating with each other and doing things on their own. Some shortsighted practices that only consider the immediate future and disregard long-term interests, as well as ideas that only abstractly fantasize about the future without starting from the current practical foundation, must be fundamentally reversed and completely changed.

2. Fully recognize and truly grasp the complexity, rigor, and correlation of agricultural science and technology, so as to popularize and improve agricultural technology. We should honestly carry out work in accordance with the requirements and regulations of science and technology (such as the specifications and quality of new agricultural tools, the adaptation area and characteristics of seeds, the combination and usage of pesticides, etc.). For the specified time, we must not extend or shorten it, for the specified temperature, we must not increase or decrease it, and for the specified quantity, we must not add or reduce it... All the complexity, rigor, and correlation of science and technology must be truly grasped.

3. In promoting agricultural science and technology, we must deeply pay attention to the specific local conditions and the maturity of the technology. If we are not sure in this regard, then even if something conforms to the principles of science and technology, we should not promote it immediately, at most, we should focus on it. Our basic spirit and attitude towards agricultural science and technology is careful planning and steady promotion. We will never universally promote anything we are not sure about. No matter what technology it is, we are only allowed to do it well and not allowed to make mistakes. At the same time, the corrupt and unscientific old technologies must be corrected and criticized.

4. In the past, we have made many mistakes, and the lack of work inspection is one of the main reasons for causing these mistakes. Therefore, in future work, we must establish a thorough work inspection system, from leading personnel to grass-roots work cadres, we must all do it ourselves, conduct timely and in-depth inspections, so as to prevent errors in advance and timely sum up experience and correct deviations.

    正确地掌握和运用农业科学技术
    东北人民政府农业部副部长  张克威
    共同纲领第四十三条说：“努力发展自然科学，以服务于工业农业和国防建设。”这就明确地指出了农业科学技术在新民主主义国家的建设中占着如何重要的地位。我是一个自然科学工作者，也是一个直接参加东北农业生产领导工作的人员，愿就目前东北农业科学技术问题，提供一些意见。
    （一）农业科学技术的复杂性、严格性和相关性
    农业科学技术是自然科学中的一个重要部门，它研究的科目和涉及的范围是相当广阔和复杂的，至少要包括天候气象、地质土壤、植物动物、细菌昆虫、物理化学、生理生态、病理医疗、遗传和变异以及数学等科学问题，这些问题的研究，随时随地地都要关联到具体环境中的人力、动力以及实现农业科学技术的当前设备等的问题。对这些科学技术，用辩证的唯物的观点，进行正确的、深入的研究，并加以具体运用，乃是提高农业生产，增加产量的一个最有效的具体保证，是扫除农业生产前进道路上障碍物的武器。如果缺乏这门科学，或不能用辩证的唯物的观点去正确地掌握它，运用它，那么几千年来一线相传的保守的和经验主义的老一套种地办法就不会被打破。也就是说，如果没有无产阶级的农业科学技术的新生，那些陈腐的旧东西是不会死掉的。因为生产技术是以生产方式为基础而发展的，它是活的东西，经常总有一些旧的方法被新发现的方法取而代之。因此，农业科学技术的性格有三个基本特点：一是内容科目的多面性和复杂性；二是在技术操作的要求上具有高度的严格性；三是各种直接或间接因素的联结相关性。我们必须深刻地认识它的特点，掌握其特性，才能达到正确地运用农业科学技术、提高农业生产的目的，否则，就要犯错误；事实上，确也有些人不了解或不大了解农业科学技术范围的广阔和内容的复杂，他们认为农业技术是“粗拉活儿”，容易将就，或以为种庄稼很简单，是“笨人”干的事，一看就会，在从事技术工作时竟玩忽科学技术的严格要求而粗心大意地随便操作。这种思想和工作方法，是很错误的，也是很危险的。
    中国民谚说：“三年学个生意人，一辈子只学半个庄稼人。”又说：“种地的事，粗像水缸，细如毫毛。”这几句话，充分反映出人民从数千年的生活和劳动中，已体验到农业技术的复杂性、精细性，这几句话是寓有深刻道理的。因为农业生产本身是复杂而精细的，是多种因素经过几个季节互相联系结合才能得出结果的工作，所以就决定了它的性格是复杂的、严格的、相关的。不掌握住这个性格，其结果，技术就是非科学的；如果运用这种技术从事农业生产，就会造成损失或造成不良影响。以科学的严格性来说，它对配比数量、温度、时间等条件的要求是非常严格的，不能马虎从事，或滥行改变、随意而为。这好像：水是二氢一氧的化合物，如果改为二氢二氧，就化合成消毒用的双氧水，而不是普通的水了；水在零度以上的一般温度时是液体的东西，如果温度降到零下就要变成固体，到了沸度以上，就成为汽体了。鸡卵在一定的温度、湿度和一定的时间，才能变成小鸡，如果随意改变其在科学技术上的严格要求，就不能孵出小鸡。科学技术的严格性这一真理，在一切事物中，都随时可以发现。但是，有的人总是无视这一真理，因而犯了许多错误。例如，今年三月，松江省农林厅技佐许朝栋，曾在富锦县帮助群众用“冷水温汤浸种法”进行小麦种籽消毒工作，当时，他单纯为了“争取在一定时间内完成浸种任务”，而完全忽视了科学技术操作规程的严格要求。本来，“冷水温汤浸种”的正确操作是先用冷水浸种（浸的时间还须看冷水的温度而定），然后捞出放入五十度的温水里浸二——三分钟，继由五十度的温水中捞出，立即放入五十五度的温水内浸五分钟，捞出后再投入冷水中冷却，然后凉干才可播种。这一技术操作对温度、时间的要求，是严格的，必须精确执行，时间不能长也不能短，温度不能高也不能低。而许朝栋在这个关键问题上完全犯了错误，结果不但造成了消毁七万三千斤“农林三号”优良麦种的损失，并且对技术推广工作起了不良的影响。又如东北人民政府农业部病虫害科技术员杨惠民今年在双城指导群众用“恒温浸种法”作种籽消毒时，他鉴于许朝栋浸麦种因温度过高而出了毛病的教训，便对推广员说：“温度低一些，别出乱子。”结果推广员把温度降低到四十四度以下，违背了严格的科学要求，完全失败。再举一个典型例子：一九四八年，辽东省有百分之二十左右的苹果树患腐烂病，近几年来运用科学技术防治的结果，病枝树已大大减少。如复县得利寺村果树合作社的苹果树，三年前患腐烂病的在百分之二十以上，正确运用科学技术防治后，现在此病已被消除（据检查，一万五千棵树中，病枝树只有三棵）；但旅顺市复县华铜区、盖平县西河区等地则因未按照科学技术的严格要求去防治，直到目前，苹果腐烂病仍甚严重，特别是旅顺市鸭咀村苹果腐烂病有了发展，现在该村百分之五十以上的苹果树有腐烂病。因此，必须按照科学的严格要求，正确地运用农业科学技术，才能够收到效果，特别是对于农业技术所要求的时间、数量、质量、温度、湿度、配合比例等，更必须正确掌握。
    再说明一下科学技术因素相关性的问题。从植物生长所需的因素讲，光、热、养料和水，是植物生长的四个主要因素。这些因素在植物生长上底数量相关性的试验，以前曾有过好多次。德国人赫尔里格尔已较早地作过这样的植物和水的关系的试验：用八个大小相等的盆，装入等重同样的土壤，使土壤在盆内所占的体积相等，种入精选过的来源和发芽率相同的大麦籽，各盆间所不同的只是含水量一项。他把各盆的水湿保持到原有持水力的百分之五、十、二十、三十、四十、六十、八十、一百，每天分早晚两次测量各盆的重量，对蒸发掉的水量，用灌水法补充，各盆的水湿，在植物生长期间，一直保持未变。大麦成熟后，各盆的产量是：含水百分之五的几乎全无收成，含水百分之十的产量很多，自后产量随含水量增高而增多，到含水百分之六十时已达最高收量，含水百分之八十的产量反减，含水百分之一百的全无收成。这是许多资产阶级的农业家们不顾植物生长诸因素底相关性的反科学试验的典型例子。他们根据这类试验的结果，提出所谓“最高量、最低量及适量法则”，认为植物生长的因素，只有适量存在时，才能得到最高的产量，过多或过少都不适宜，这就是他们倡导“土壤肥力递减律”的“理论”根据。列宁首先注意了这个问题，他在作了各方面的研究以后，给予这个错误法则
    ——“土壤肥力递减律”以彻底的批判。列宁说：“资产阶级科学家为了蒙蔽资本主义者所给予农业改进的阻碍而想出这个法则。因为继续增加植物生长的因素而使产量减低，并不是一种法则的作用，而是由于忽视农业上需要全部农业因素联系存在的基本科学法则所引起的必然结果。就是说光、热、养料和水，对于植物生长的重要性是相等的，缺乏某一种，不能用加多别一种的方法来代替。”沃尔那根据列宁的指示，用辩证唯物的科学方法，试验了植物产量因素相关的结果，更证实了“土壤肥力递减律”不合于农业生产的实际情况，自然界里并不存在这个法则。实际上，资产阶级科学家们所说的产量递减现象，是因为植物全部生长因素同等重要性法则的不可及性而发生的。这就指明了认识并掌握农业科学技术的因素相关性是如何的重要。可是就在这一点上，我们仍有许多人依然犯了原则性的错误。例如开原县三台子村集体农庄，据说今年在河水淤过的土地上种的小麦，每公顷施硫安三百斤（原计划要施六百斤），并施一千二百斤豆饼；但他们并未补充配合使用磷肥和钾肥，其结果小麦徒长茎叶，籽实不多，并因有效氮和硫酸分离后，游离的硫酸损害了作物及土壤。再如种畜场对种马的饲养，不能经常给以适当的完全饲料，不是水炭素高（高粱之类）就是蛋白质过多，或者是青蓄饲料（萝卜之类）不足、运动不够，以致种马在配种期体力不强，精虫成活率不高。至于种地只看到种籽、肥料、农具、防治病虫等因素，而对耕作方法、适时播种和锄草、掌握降雨量、日照时间，地势高低、轮作等方面，注意不足，以致影响最高产量的实现，这都反映了我们还不大懂得农业科学技术因素相关性的道理。解决这一问题，须加强唯物辩证的科学理论的学习，并吸取社会主义农业生产中的斯达哈诺夫运动的成功经验，把农业生产的各种因素密切地结合起来，掌握其相关性，以加速提高农业生产力，增加收获量，这已经成为目前农业科学技术上的一个重要的现实任务。
    （二）东北农业科学技术工作中的几个问题
    东北的农业科学技术工作，由于中央和东北党政领导机关的正确领导，并由于技术工作人员和广大农民的努力，特别是劳动模范和积极分子的带头，几年来，已有了相当的成绩，农业生产总值已超过伪满最高峰一九四三年水平的百分之十点五。单位面积产量亦超过一九四三年最高产量的百分之六·七。但工作中也暴露了许多缺点。为了克服缺点，在“三反”运动以后，林枫副主席又指示我们：“应该从‘三反’运动中总结出几条经验，……找到过去工作中所发生的‘乱子’及其原因，以便有计划、有步骤地一件一件地经过详细分析研究后，提出改进方案。”这是非常明确而具体的指示，对我是一个重大的教育，我要根据这一指示，进行深入的检查；同时也希望每个农业工作者，都来一个严肃而彻底的自我检查，这对今后农业建设工作的开展，是有莫大好处的。
    现在把我在参加东北农业生产领导工作过程中所看到的、在“掌握和运用农业科学技术”方面所发生的若干偏差，以及根据这些偏差初步体会到的几个问题，简略地分述如下：
    一、工作中有急于求成的现象，忽视了技术的成熟程度和客观条件的配合。例如吉林省在一九五○年曾勉强动员农民播种十余万垧冬麦，但因技术条件没有具备，只是急于求成，因而遭受失败，群众称冬麦为“冻麦”。同年该省又大量推广“高作培土除草犁”，亦由于未周密地考虑技术设计条件是否成熟，急躁盲目地推下一万四千台，结果农具不好使，群众称培土除草犁为“赔本除苗犁”，拒绝使用。今年松江省所以发生许朝栋消毁七万余斤麦种的严重错误事件，许朝栋在技术操作上固然有错误，但省农业领导机关对技术条件和设备条件的掌握和运用，也都不够慎重和周密，急于求成，则是造成“许朝栋错误事件”的另一原因。
    二、忽视农业科学技术的严格性、地区性，因而各地在这一方面，曾屡犯较严重的错误。辽东省于一九五○年推广“熊岳耲耙”，由于未注意地区性，到处滥推广，遭到失败。一九四九年铁岭滥行推广“双心棒”高粱，结果反使产量减低。一九五○年龙江县盲目推广“长春三号”高粱的结果，每垧少打了两石粮。辽东省兽疫防治队于一九五○年在庄河县进行牛瘟防疫时，因操作技术马虎而采用了带炭疽牛的血液，混入炭疽菌，死去耕牛七十头。同年东北人民政府农业部进行防治牛肺疫注射时，因用未驯化适当程度的生菌以及注射手术部位的不当，曾使少数牛死亡和多数牛烂掉尾巴。另如东北兽疫研究所曾因操作技术不精细，制出的血清，有少数带有杂菌，而成了废品。
    三、工作缺乏组织性计划性和分工配合不够，各搞一套的问题。这类的错误事件也是不少的。在一九五○年农具改革工作中，有不少地区未经上级批准，即行推广“联合号铲趟机”等农具，结果吃了大亏。东北农学院在修建化学及生物馆时，事先缺乏周密计划，工程完竣后才发觉没有安装电热水管。熊岳农场有克利呆种公羊，铁岭种畜场有同种母羊，两场谁也舍不得将羊合理移让，而是坚持本场利益，互不配合，各搞一套，影响了优良种羊的试验繁殖工作。锦州农业试验场有“锦育五号”优良棉种，因该场某些人员有保守思想，不愿供给他处研究，也阻碍了良棉的育种繁殖工作。
    四、眼光短浅，只看现在，不看将来，对不科学的旧技术未给以彻底批判。例如旅大区内有若干陡坡和山林地，数年来由于滥砍滥伐、开荒，地力已低至“得不偿失”的程度，不仅发生了“撩荒”现象，而且加重了山洪的为害。一九四九年由苏联运入三种优良麦种时，接运该批麦种的贸易运输单位，只看到本单位当前的利益，没看到优良麦种的繁殖推广对未来农业生产的重大价值，结果为了几千条麻袋而把麦种完全弄杂，造成了不可补救的损失。目前有些农民仍盲目地使用那些落后技术
    ——如“豆油拌种”、“猪头肉施肥”、“绳拉麦锈病”等，我们也没有根据辩证唯物的农业科学道理，予以彻底的批判，或以新的农业科学技术来代替这种反科学的陈腐的老技术。
    上述的缺点和错误的存在，我首先应作自我检查。但也希望直接领导农业科学技术工作的同志及实际参加这一工作的同志们，进行深刻检查，并总结出经验教训，以便把今后的工作提高一步。
    （三）今后应当怎么办
    关于今后正确地运用农业科学技术的问题，我个人的初步意见是：充分掌握科学技术的性格，针对目前工作中的问题，根据林枫副主席的指示，进行一次工作大检查，使农业科学技术工作在高度的政治思想指导之下，克服保守主义、经验主义以及政治和技术对立的观点，做到以下几点：
    一、省县农业领导机关和所有农业工作人员，都应在“统一计划，统一领导”下有计划有步骤地推行农业科学技术，严格工作的组织性、纪律性，防止和纠正那种不顾整体计划，事先不作计划，事到眼前急忙乱搞，或互不联系配合，各搞一套的作法。某些片面地只为眼前打算不顾长远利益的“短视”作法，以及只抽象地幻想将来而不从目前实际基础出发的想法，都必须根本加以扭转，彻底改变。
    二、充分认识并确实掌握农业科学技术的复杂性，严格性、相关性，从而把农业技术普及开来，并加以提高。应该老老实实地按照科学技术的要求和规定（例如新农具的规格和质量，种籽的适应区域和特点，农药的配合使用量和操作方法等）来进行工作，对规定了的时间，既不许延长也不许缩短，对规定了的温度，既不能增高也不能降低，对规定了的数量，既不可加多也不可减少……所有科学技术上的复杂性、严格性、相关性，都必须确实地掌握起来。
    三、推行农业科学技术，必须深切地注意当地的具体情况和技术方面的成熟程度。如果在这方面没有把握，那末纵然符合科学技术原理的东西，我们也不要即时推广，至多是重点地搞一搞。我们对待农业科学技术的基本精神和态度是周密计划，稳步推行，没有把握的就绝不普遍推广，无论哪一件技术，只许搞好不许出岔子。同时对那些陈腐的不科学的旧技术，必须给予指正和批判。
    四、过去，我们曾犯了许多错误，工作缺乏检查是造成这些错误的主要原因之一。因此在今后的工作中，必须建立周密的工作检查制度，从领导人员到基层工作干部，都必须亲自动手，及时深入地进行检查，做到事先防止错误和及时总结经验，纠正偏差。     （原载五月二十六日东北日报）
