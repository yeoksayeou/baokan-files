To Seriously Do a Good Job in Cotton Field Seedling Transfer and Replanting

Whether or not a cotton crop will be bountiful is primarily determined by whether the emergence of seedlings is uniform and whether full stands are ensured. The proverbs "Money for seeds, no money for seedlings" and "See three-tenths of a crop from the seedlings" both illustrate the importance of preserving seedlings.

This year, the seedling emergence situation in cotton fields across the country is generally good. However, some areas have experienced missing seedlings due to early sowing, poor sowing techniques, or seedling diseases. However, some areas with missing seedlings have not paid enough attention to the work of inspecting, replanting, and protecting seedlings. For example, in Tongxian County, Hebei Province, many cotton fields have missing seedlings, and replanting work has not been carried out in a timely manner. In some areas, there has been a lack of the habit of replanting cotton seedlings in the past, and grain crops are replanted in cotton fields with missing seedlings. As a result, neither cotton nor grain can achieve good harvests. These areas should vigorously promote the work of replanting and protecting seedlings in cotton fields.

There are two methods for replanting seedlings in cotton fields: one is replanting seeds, and the other is transplanting seedlings. It is too late to replant seeds now, and all localities should seize the time and vigorously promote cotton seedling transplantation.

Two years of experience have proven that seedling transplantation is an effective measure to fill gaps in cotton fields and ensure high yields. In 1950, more than 400 villages in Liaoxi Province transplanted more than 580,000 seedlings, with a survival rate generally above 90%. In 1951, cotton farmer Huang Chenggui in Sheyang, Subei, had missing seedlings in his cotton field. He transplanted more than 800 seedlings in two acres of cotton field, and all of them survived. All localities must use these specific examples to eliminate the masses' ideological concerns that they do not believe cotton transplantation can survive; mobilize Party members, League members, and labor models to take the lead, carry out publicity and demonstrations, launch a seedling inspection, seedling transplantation, and seedling replanting campaign to ensure full stands in cotton fields, and strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

### 要认真做好棉田移苗补苗工作

    要认真做好棉田移苗补苗工作
    棉花能否丰收，首先决定于出苗是否整齐，以及能否保证全苗。“有钱买种，无钱买苗”，“见苗三成收”的农谚都说明了保苗的重要性。
    今年全国各地棉田的出苗情况，一般说来是好的。但是，也有少数地区或因播种过早，或因播种技术较差，或因幼苗遭受病害，以致发生了缺苗现象。但有些缺苗地区对查苗、补苗、保苗工作，还没有引起足够的重视。例如，河北省通县有许多棉田缺苗，就没有及时进行补苗工作。有些地区，过去缺乏补种棉苗的习惯，而在缺苗的棉田内，补种粮食作物。结果棉花、粮食都不能得到好的收成。这些地区，都应大力推行棉田补苗保苗工作。
    棉田补苗的方法有二：一是补种，一是移苗。现在补种为时已晚，各地应该抓紧时间，大力推行棉花移苗。
    两年来的经验证明，移苗是补齐棉田缺苗、保证丰产的有效措施。一九五○年辽西省四百多村移苗五十八万多株，成活率一般在百分之九十以上。一九五一年苏北射阳棉农黄成贵的棉田缺苗，他在二亩棉田内移苗八百多株，结果全部成活。各地必须利用这些具体事例，消除群众不相信棉花移植可以成活的思想顾虑；发动党员、团员和劳动模范带头，进行宣传示范，开展一个查苗、移苗、补苗运动，保证棉田全苗，争取今年棉花丰收。
