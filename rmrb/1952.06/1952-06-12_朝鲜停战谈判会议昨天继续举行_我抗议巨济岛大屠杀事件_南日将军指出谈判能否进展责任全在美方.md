Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 11th. The plenary meeting of the delegation from both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations continued on the 11th, after the US side evaded the meeting and unilaterally adjourned for three days. During the US side's unilateral adjournment, it once again carried out a frenzied massacre of our captured personnel. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, was instructed to lodge a serious protest:
"According to publicly available incomplete reports, on June 10th, your side massacred 31 of our captured personnel on Geoje Island and wounded 139 of our captured personnel. This is another extremely serious provocative act by your side, and I am instructed to lodge a serious protest with your side. Your side, disregarding our repeated protests and warnings, as well as the anger and condemnation of the people of the world, continues to massacre our captured personnel. The massacre on June 10th even exceeds the severity of previous incidents. Your side took advantage of your unilateral adjournment to arrange and carry out this massacre, which further proves that this incident was a planned conspiracy by your side, aimed at disrupting the armistice negotiations and continuing and expanding the Korean War. Our side absolutely cannot tolerate your massacre of our captured personnel. Your side must immediately stop the criminal act of massacring prisoners of war, immediately make a responsible explanation for this massacre, and bear full responsibility for the serious consequences of this incident."
General Nam Il went on to point out that the opponent's planned massacre of prisoners of war and the heroic and just struggle of our captured personnel to safeguard their right to repatriation have shattered the opponent's lies of so-called "sincerity," "good faith," and "humanitarian principles," and declared the complete bankruptcy of the opponent's plan to detain prisoners of war. Any plan to detain prisoners of war is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. Any plan to detain prisoners of war will also be resolutely rejected by our side. In order to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis, our side has proposed the completely reasonable May 2nd proposal, which is in accordance with the Geneva Convention, so that prisoners of war on both sides can immediately return home to live a peaceful life. The other side repeatedly claims in the meeting that its plan to detain prisoners of war is firm, final, and unchangeable, refuses to negotiate, and even evades meetings, while at the same time plotting to massacre our captured personnel outside the meeting, attempting to use this intimidating and despicable means to force our side to accept its plan to detain prisoners of war. But what the other side cannot obtain on the battlefield, it will never obtain at the negotiating table. The other side must abandon its intimidation tactics, stop the massacre, and withdraw its plan to detain prisoners of war. The entire future of the Korean armistice depends entirely on the other side. General Nam Il's main remarks are as follows:
"Your side has absented itself from the meeting for three days without any reason. During these three days, your side actively arranged and carried out a frenzied massacre on Geoje Island. We want to ask you: Do you want to solve the problem through negotiation and consultation, or do you want to solve the problem through massacre? You say that you have the sincerity to achieve an armistice in Korea. Does insisting on detaining prisoners of war, refusing to negotiate, frequently suggesting indefinite adjournment, and even evading meetings and walking out halfway show your sincerity? You repeatedly mention good faith here. Does your open betrayal of Colson's promise to all prisoners of war, that is, to the people of the world, that he would no longer abuse and kill prisoners of war, and your continued massacre of prisoners of war show your good faith? You talk highly of humanitarian principles. Does the bloody massacre of unarmed prisoners of war, killing more than 30 people and seriously injuring more than 130 people in two hours, show your humanitarian principles? Your side dares not face the facts and the truth, but the facts and the truth cannot be evaded. The massacre of prisoners of war cannot conceal the complete bankruptcy of your so-called 'voluntary repatriation' and so-called 'screening.' On the contrary, it only confirms that this absurd excuse is fundamentally intolerable. Any plan to detain prisoners of war is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Convention not only clearly stipulates that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of hostilities, but also clearly stipulates that prisoners of war may not, under any circumstances, renounce their right to repatriation, and it is not permissible to deprive prisoners of war of their right to repatriation under any pretext. Any plan to detain prisoners of war will be resolutely rejected by our side. In order to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis, our side has proposed the May 2nd proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to immediately return home to live a life of peace. All foreign armed personnel (United Nations forces or Chinese People's Volunteers ) captured by both sides shall be repatriated home. All Korean armed personnel (South Korean army or Korean People's Army) captured by both sides whose homes are in the other side's area shall be repatriated home. Those whose homes are in the area of the receiving party may be allowed to return home on the spot without repatriation. Our plan is fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Convention. The only dispute hindering the achievement of an armistice agreement is the dispute between returning prisoners of war home and detaining prisoners of war. Our side has thoroughly refuted and resolutely rejected your April 28th plan to detain prisoners of war. Our side firmly and unswervingly believes that our May 2nd plan is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. The responsibility for whether the Korean armistice negotiations can progress lies entirely with your side."

    朝鲜停战谈判会议昨天继续举行
    我抗议巨济岛大屠杀事件
    南日将军指出谈判能否进展责任全在美方
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会，在美方逃避会议、片面休会三天后，于十一日继续举行。美方在片面休会期间，对我方被俘人员又一次进行了疯狂的大屠杀。我方首席代表南日将军奉命提出严重抗议：
    “根据已公开的不完全的报道，六月十日你方在巨济岛屠杀我方被俘人员三十一名，打伤我方被俘人员一百三十九名。这是你方又一次极端严重的挑衅行为，我奉命向你方提出严重抗议。你方不顾我方一再的抗议和警告以及全世界人民的愤怒和谴责，继续不断地屠杀我方被俘人员。六月十日的屠杀事件，更超出了历次事件的严重程度。你方利用你方片面休会期间，布置并进行此次屠杀，更足证明此次事件是你方有计划的预谋，旨在破坏停战谈判，继续并扩大朝鲜战争。我方绝对不能容忍你方屠杀我方被俘人员。你方必须立即停止屠杀战俘的罪恶行为，立即对此次屠杀事件作负责的交代，并对此事件的严重后果负完全的责任。”
    南日将军继指出对方有计划地屠杀战俘的卑怯罪恶行为和我方被俘人员为维护他们遣返权利的英勇正义的斗争，已经粉碎了对方所谓“诚意”、所谓“信义”、所谓“人道原则”的谎言，宣布了对方扣留战俘的方案的彻底破产。任何扣留战俘的方案，都彻底违反了日内瓦公约。任何扣留战俘的方案，也将为我方所断然拒绝。我方为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，已经提出完全合理和符合于日内瓦公约的五月二日方案，使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活。对方在会内重复宣称其扣留战俘的方案为坚定的、最后的、不能改变的，拒绝进行协商，甚至于逃避会议，而同时在会外预谋屠杀我方被俘人员，企图用这种恫吓卑鄙的手段来强迫我方接受其扣留战俘的方案。但对方在战场上都不能得到的东西，绝不能在会场上取得。对方必须放弃恫吓态度，停止屠杀行为，撤消扣留战俘的方案，整个朝鲜停战的前途完全在于对方。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “你方毫无理由地逃会三天。在这三天内，你方在巨济岛积极布置并进行了疯狂的大屠杀。我们要问你们：是要用谈判协商的方式来解决问题呢？还是要用屠杀来解决问题？你们说：你们有诚意要在朝鲜达成停战，难道说坚持扣留战俘的方案，拒绝协商，经常建议无限期休会甚至于逃避会议，中途退席，就是你们的诚意吗？你们在这里一再提到信义，难道说你们公然背弃柯尔生在全体战俘面前，也就是在全世界人民面前所作的不再虐杀战俘的诺言，而继续屠杀战俘就是你们的信义吗？你们高谈人道主义的原则，难道说对手无寸铁的战俘进行血腥的屠杀，在两小时内杀死三十多人，重伤一百三十多人，就是你们的人道原则吗？你方不敢面对事实和真理，但事实和真理是不容逃避的。屠杀战俘并不能掩饰你方所谓‘自愿遣返’和所谓‘甄别’的彻底破产，相反的它只更证实这种荒谬藉口的根本不能容许。任何扣留战俘的方案，都彻底违反了日内瓦公约。日内瓦公约不仅明确规定敌对行为终止后，战俘应予释放与遣返，不得有所迟延，并且更明确规定战俘在任何情况下，均不得放弃其遣返权利，不容许以任何藉口剥夺战俘遣返的权利，扣留战俘。任何扣留战俘的方案都将为我方所断然拒绝。为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，我方已经提出了使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活的五月二日方案。双方所俘获的外国武装人员（联合国军或中国人民志愿军）应全部遣返回家，双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员（南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军）其家在对方地区者应全部遣返回家，其家在收容者方面地区者得许其就地回家，不必遣返。我方方案完全符合于日内瓦公约精神。阻碍着停战谈判达成协议的唯一争执是遣返战俘回家与扣留战俘之间的争执。我方已经彻底驳斥并断然拒绝了你方四月二十八日扣留战俘的方案。我方坚持不可动摇地认为我方五月二日方案是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。朝鲜停战谈判能否进展，其责任完全在于你方。”
