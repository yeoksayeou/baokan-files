Editor's note: On November 18th of last year, this newspaper published an article entitled "'No, We Want to Live!' Before and After Filming," reporting on the struggles of the Japanese progressive film industry to fight for peace and democracy and against the use of film as a tool for war propaganda. At that time, the Japanese "Forward Theatre Troupe" and progressive filmmakers, relying on sporadic fundraising from the Japanese people, had already produced the film "No, We Want to Live!" (The screenplay for this film has been translated into Chinese by Mei Tao and published in the Shanghai Dagong Bao). Subsequently, they produced progressive films such as "Mother, Woman" and "Hakone Storm Records," and were planning to build a film studio for the Japanese people. Recently, we received a letter from Kawarasaki Chojuro, the leader of the Japanese "Forward Theatre Troupe" (one of the main characters in "Hakone Storm Records"), expressing his gratitude to the peace-loving and democratic people of China for their assistance to the Japanese progressive film industry.

The just struggle of Japanese progressive literary and art workers is heroic and arduous. Kawarasaki Chojuro mentions the persecution they suffered from the Japanese reactionaries in his letter. Recently, this persecution has become even more intensified. According to Kyodo News, the reactionary Yoshida government unreasonably arrested three actors from the "Forward Theatre Troupe" on May 24th.

The following is the original letter from Kawarasaki Chojuro.

Many comrades in China donated to our movement to build a film studio, and sent the donations through the Chinese People's Relief Administration. We would like to express our deepest gratitude here.

After our appeal was published in your newspaper and other newspapers and magazines in your country, we received many letters of encouragement and materials from comrades in China. This shows that our work is not only a matter of striving for Japan's independence and democracy, but also a link in the struggle for world peace. This has greatly increased our confidence and, at the same time, made us deeply aware of the responsibility of the Japanese nation.

Although we have directly replied to the comrades who wrote to us, there are many, many comrades whose names we do not even know, so we ask you to convey our gratitude to them through your newspaper.

"No, We Want to Live!" has received a great response among the masses after its release. Despite various obstacles, it continues to be screened in various places. At the same time, the release of this film has sparked a wave of progressive films made independently by the Japanese people. The "Mother, Woman" produced by the Kinuta Film Studio and the "Yamahiko School" produced by the Yagi Film Studio have both been completed. The Forward Theatre Troupe's second work, "Hakone Storm Records," has also been completed in struggle.

"Hakone Storm Records" is based on the large-scale civil engineering project in Hakone during the Tokugawa era. It is a large-scale film depicting the people of Hakone fighting against violence and uniting with the peasants. The production of this film received more help from the masses than the production of "No, We Want to Live!" The investment from the audience and other trade unions has increased a lot, so we were able to pay more than 30 million yen in production costs. In addition to Iida Choko, who participated last time, progressive artists such as Yamada Isuzu and Usuda Kenji, and famous actresses such as Todoroki Yukiko also participated as main actors. Extras - farmers from the filming location and students from the University of Tokyo - participated in volunteer performances and donated the money they deserved as investment. In this way, this film was completed by concentrating a wide range of forces. Now this film is being shown in cinemas all over the country, and it has received even greater success than "No, We Want to Live!" However, the oppression and obstruction of the enemy are also very fierce, and there are various difficulties even in finding a cinema to screen it.

We very much hope that you will see these films. Although we feel extremely regretful that we cannot do so now due to our lack of strength, we hope to be able to do so in the near future.

Our movement to build a film studio is to overcome the difficulties caused by the lack of equipment and the inability to rent a film studio when making progressive films independently. We earnestly hope to build it within this year and are working hard to do so.

However, the work of recovering funds from "No, We Want to Live!" is still in progress, and the production of "Hakone Storm Records" and the development of various new undertakings require funds. It is clear that fundraising in Japan alone is not enough. At such a time, receiving your large donations has really added to our great courage. We will use this to expand this movement.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for your tangible and intangible assistance, and at the same time, we pledge to respond to your expectations with our future efforts, and please continue to give us assistance in the future.

Representative of the Forward Theatre Troupe, Kawarasaki Chojuro
1952, March 30

### 日本进步演员河原崎长十郎来信

专栏：

    日本进步演员河原崎长十郎来信
    编者按：去年十一月十八日本刊发表了“‘不，我们要活下去！’摄制前后”一文，报道了日本进步电影界为争取和平、民主，反对把电影当作战争宣传工具而斗争的情况。那时日本“前进剧团”和进步电影工作者，依靠日本人民群众的零星集资，已经制成了影片“不，我们要活下去！”（这部影片的电影剧本，已由梅韬译成中文，在上海大公报发表）。以后，他们又摄制了“母亲，女人”和“箱根风云录”等进步影片，并在筹建日本人民的电影制片厂。最近我们收到了日本“前进剧团”的领导人河原崎长十郎（“箱根风云录”中的主角之一）的来信，向援助日本进步电影事业的中国爱好和平民主的人们表示感谢。
    日本进步文艺工作者的正义斗争是英勇而艰苦的。河原崎长十郎信中提到日本反动派对他们的迫害。最近这种迫害更变本加厉。据共同社消息，吉田反动政府在五月二十四日又无理逮捕了“前进剧团”的演员三人。
    下面是河原崎长十郎的原信。
    许多在中国的同志对我们建设制片厂的运动进行募捐，并通过中国人民救济总会送来了捐款，我们在此敬致深深的谢忱。
    我们的呼吁在贵报以及贵国的其他报纸杂志上刊登出来以后，我们就收到了许多在中国的同志寄给我们的鼓励信和资料。这说明了我们的工作，不仅仅是争取日本的独立与民主的问题，而且是争取世界和平斗争的一环。这增加了我们很大的信心，同时更使我们深深地感到日本民族的责任。
    给我们来信的同志们，我们虽然直接回覆了答谢信，但是有很多很多的同志，我们连姓名都不知道，所以我们请求通过贵报，向他们传达我们的谢意。
    “不，我们要活下去！”上映后，在群众中收到了很大的效果。尽管有种种阻挠，现在仍在各地继续上映。同时，由于这部片子的上映，引起了日本人民自力制作进步影片的浪潮。砧电影制片所的“母亲、女人”和八木电影制片所的“山彦学校”都已完成。前进剧团的第二部作品“箱根风云录”，也在斗争中完成了。
    “箱根风云录”取材于德川时代箱根的土木大工程。这是描写箱根人民一面和暴力斗争，一面和农民团结的一部规模很大的影片。这部影片的摄制，比摄制“不，我们要活下去！”时得到了更多的群众帮助。观众出资和其他工会的投资增加很多，因此我们得以付出三千万日圆以上的摄制费。主要演员除上次的饭田蝶子外，山田五十铃、薄田研二等进步艺术家和轰夕起子那样有名的女演员也参加了。临时演员们——拍摄外景地方的农民和东京大学学生们，参加了义务演出，将应得的钱作为投资。就这样，这部影片是集中了范围很大的力量才完成的。现在这部影片在全国各地电影院上映，收到比“不，我们要活下去！”更大的成绩。但是，敌人的压迫、妨害也很激烈，连找到上映的电影院都有种种困难。
    我们非常希望你们看看这些电影。虽然现在由于我们力量不能做到而感到极大遗憾，但希望在不久的将来必定做到。
    我们的建设制片厂运动，就是为了要克服在自力制作进步影片时器材不够和租不到制片厂而引起的困难。我们切实希望在今年年内建设它，现正努力进行中。
    但是，“不，我们要活下去！”的收回资金工作还在进行中，而“箱根风云录”的摄制和种种新事业的开展都需要用款。很明显，单单在日本国内募捐是力量不够的。在这样的时候，收到了你们很大的捐款，实在增添了我们莫大的勇气。我们将借此把这个运动扩大。
    谨向你们有形无形的援助致衷心的感谢，同时誓以今后的努力回答你们的期待，并请今后继续给我们援助。
