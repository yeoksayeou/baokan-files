Danyang County Adopts Temple Fair Format to Organize Short-Distance Material Exchange

Since May 23rd to 25th, Danyang County, Southern Jiangsu District, adopted the format of rural temple fairs and markets to hold an organized urban-rural material exchange conference, focusing on retail business. During the conference, 30,000 people visited and traded, with a total transaction volume of 2,000,560,000 yuan. This planned organization of short-distance exchange within the county, using a format familiar to the masses, has a significant effect on enlivening the urban-rural economy and strengthening urban-rural relations.

Before organizing this conference, the county first established a conference preparatory committee composed of representatives from relevant units, with the Danyang County Chief serving as the chairman. The committee mobilized the county's industrial and commercial sectors to participate in material exchange, mobilized farmers and handicraft households to prepare products and visit the city, and mobilized residents to provide hospitality for farmers, and so on.

The conference was divided into two parts: one was the exchange, which lasted for two days, with state-owned companies, cooperatives, and industrial and commercial sectors from various districts participating in the transaction, resulting in a transaction volume of over 1,700,000,000 yuan; the other part was the market. The two parts together totaled 2,000,560,000 yuan in transactions, with 426 transaction contracts and purchase and sales plans signed. Many materials were involved in the transaction, with small handicraft products alone amounting to over 30,000 pieces.

On the second day after the opening of the conference, farmers flocked into the city. The city residents also enthusiastically participated in the conference work, accommodating overnight farmers in their homes and taking care of their belongings. Producers and consumers met, urban and rural industrial and commercial operators met, and transactions worth more than 1,000,000,000 yuan were completed in a single day. During the conference, many new urban-rural commercial relationships were established, and private merchants also gained profits in the transactions; in order to unite with capitalists, employees held store affairs meetings one after another, formulated production plans, and actively helped capitalists improve their operations. The people of the entire county were swept into this exchange upsurge, and through practical examples, the people of the entire county universally recognized that urban-rural exchange is a major event in the people's economic life.

The gains of this conference are significant. First, it facilitated the exchange of goods, enlivened the urban-rural economy, and strengthened urban-rural relations. After farmers sold some sideline products at the exchange conference, their purchasing power increased compared to before, and urban and rural industry and commerce also prospered accordingly. The market situation in late May (after the conference) was significantly different from that in mid-May (before the conference). Taking the business situation of four stores as an example: the Dong Sheng Native Products Store, a native products business, had a turnover of 7,630,000 yuan in mid-May, and 11,070,000 yuan in late May; the Yuan Mao Shun Rice Store, a grain business, had a turnover of 2,610,000 yuan in mid-May, which increased to 5,160,000 yuan in late May; the Heng Xing Silk and Cloth Store, a silk and cloth business, had a turnover of 6,010,000 yuan in mid-May, which increased to 12,540,000 yuan in late May; the Yi Sheng Chang Department Store, a department store, had a turnover of 1,980,000 yuan in mid-May, which increased to 3,930,000 yuan in late May. The business figures of industrial and commercial enterprises in various towns and townships in Danyang County also increased. According to statistics, this year's April increased by 85.09% compared to the same period last year.

Second, it corrected the past view that local specialties only had prospects for long-distance sales. During the preparation of the conference, an industrial and commercial representative once estimated the turnover of the conference: "About 20 to 30 million yuan will be no problem." Urban and rural industrial and commercial operators believed that doing business in the city was only "supporting" urban industrial and commercial enterprises, and even some representatives of state-owned companies only focused on the transportation and sales of large-scale native products, believing that "short-distance exchange cannot solve the problems of state-owned companies." But as a result, the conference traded over 2,000,000,000 yuan. The facts proved that the saying "nothing remarkable can be exchanged within the county" was wrong.

Third, it boosted the business confidence of private industrial and commercial operators. Before the conference, some industrial and commercial operators in Danyang County had a wrong understanding of the great "Five-Anti" Movement, feeling that "the bourgeoisie has no future"; therefore, they were operating passively. Although the Danyang County People's Government had convened several conferences for the industrial and commercial sectors in succession, explaining that in a new democratic society, the bourgeoisie still has a future for existence and development; however, some industrial and commercial operators were still skeptical, saying: "Is there such a good thing?" However, before and after the conference, state-owned enterprises supported private industrial and commercial enterprises with practical actions: the People's Bank successively lent 2,200,000,000 yuan to industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; the state-owned native products company also took the initiative to contact native products, oil cake, ironware and other industries, established purchase and sales relationships, and purchased more than 200,000,000 yuan of unsalable native silk. Especially after the conference, private industrial and commercial operators saw that the urban economy was improving, and they had legitimate profits in the exchange conference, so their business confidence increased. For example, Heng Xing Silk and Cloth Store previously had low business confidence because it could not see the future, but now it has added various colored floral cloths; several native products stores that were originally going to close went to Xuzhou to purchase goods on the third day after the conference; some capitalists in the department store industry also went to Shanghai to purchase goods and promote goods in the countryside; the shop windows of silk and cloth stores were also piled up. Lin Jingbo, chairman of the county's Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "After this meeting, the industrial and commercial sectors have become much clearer-headed, and truly realized that the past passive operation was wrong."

Fourth, during the conference, various native products, handicrafts, and other materials were displayed all over the streets, with good and bad clearly distinguished and prices unified, establishing a new commercial atmosphere. At the same time, it also allowed customers to freely buy goods of good quality and that they needed. This also educated some producers to pay attention to the improvement of quality in the future, and played a role in guiding production. The People's Government also maintained public order, so that farmers avoided the losses of being subjected to price reductions by private merchants and having money stolen by pickpockets in the past.

What was not done well in this conference was: 1. The conference did not pay attention to holding it during the slack period of the busy farming season. The exchange time was exactly when farmers were harvesting wheat, and coupled with the rush in preparation, the work of mobilizing farmers to visit was not done well enough. 2. Some state-owned companies did not have enough understanding of this conference and adopted a perfunctory attitude, which weakened the due role of this conference.

Now, the county's Urban-Rural Material Exchange Promotion Association, in addition to supervising the relevant parties to earnestly implement the contracts and agreements signed this time, is also preparing to mobilize various districts and towns to absorb the experience of this conference and continue to hold material exchange of the same form.

### 丹阳县采用庙会形式组织短距离物产交流

    丹阳县采用庙会形式组织短距离物产交流
    苏南区丹阳县自五月二十三日到二十五日三天中，采用了农村庙会集场的形式，以零售业务为主，有组织地举行了一个城乡物产交流大会。大会期间，有三万人来参观和做买卖，共成交二十亿零五千六百余万元。这种用群众熟悉的形式，在县的范围里有计划地组织短距离交流，使生产者和消费者直接见面，对活泼城乡经济、密切城乡关系有巨大作用。
    该县在组织这一大会以前，先成立了由各有关单位代表参加的大会筹备会，由丹阳县长亲自担任主任委员，动员全县工商界参加物产交流，动员农民和手工业户备好产品和来城参观，动员居民做好招待农民的工作等等。
    大会分两个部分进行：一个是交易所，举行了两天，国营公司、合作社和各区工商界参加交易，成交十七亿元以上；另外一个部分是集场。两个部分共计成交二十亿零五千六百余万元，订立成交合同、购销计划计四百二十六笔。参加交易的物产很多，光小手工业品就有三万余件。
    大会开幕以后的第二天，农民们纷纷进城。城里的居民们也热情地参加了大会工作，招待过夜农民住在自己家里并代他们保管东西。生产者和消费者见面，城市工商业者和农村工商业者见面，在一天之中就成交了十亿多元。在会议期间，建立了很多新的城乡商业关系，私商在交易中也获得了利润；职工们为团结资方，纷纷开了店务会议，订出了生产计划，并主动帮助资方积极改进经营。全县人民都卷入这个交流热潮中，从实际事例中，使全县人民普遍地认识到城乡交流是人民经济生活中的一件大事。
    这个大会的收获是很大的。第一、沟通了有无，活泼了城乡经济，密切了城乡关系。农民在交流大会上销出了一些副产品后，购买力较前提高，城乡工商业也随着繁荣。五月下旬（大会后）和五月中旬（大会前）的市面就大不相同。以四家商店的营业情况为例：南货业的东升南货店五月中旬营业额是七百六十三万元，下旬是一千一百零七万元；粮食业的源茂顺米店，五月中旬营业额是二百六十一万元，下旬增加到五百十六万元；绸布业的恒兴绸布店，五月中旬营业额是六百零一万元，下旬增加到一千二百五十四万元；百货业义生昌百货店，五月中旬营业额是一百九十八万元，下旬增加到三百九十三万元。丹阳县乡区各市镇的工商业的营业数字也都增加，据统计：今年四月份就比去年同期增加百分之八五·○九。
    第二、纠正了过去认为土特产只有远距离推销才有出路的看法。在大会筹备时，有一个工商界代表曾对这个大会营业额作了估计：“大约二、三千万元没有问题”。市镇工商业者认为进城做生意，不过是给城市工商业“捧捧场”而已，甚至有些国营公司代表也只着重大宗土产的运销，认为“短距离交流解决不了国营公司的问题”。但结果，大会交易做了二十亿余元。事实证明了“在本县里交流不出什么名堂来”的说法是错误的。
    第三、鼓舞了私营工商业者的经营信心。大会前，丹阳县某些工商业者，对伟大的“五反”运动有错误的认识，感到“资产阶级没有前途”；因此经营消极。丹阳县人民政府虽然连续召开了几次工商界的大会，说明在新民主主义社会里，资产阶级仍然有存在和发展的前途；但是，部分工商业者仍旧半信半疑，说：“那有这么好的事情？”可是，大会召开前后，国营企业以实际行动扶助了私营工商业：人民银行对有利于国计民生的行业先后贷出二十二亿元；国营土产公司也主动与南货、油饼、铁器等业进行联系，建立了购销关系，并且收购了二亿多元滞销的土绸。特别在大会后，私营工商业者看到了城市经济走向好转，在交流大会中，自己又有了合法利润，于是经营信心提高。如恒兴绸布店以前由于看不见前途，经营信心低落，现在已经添进各色花布；南货业有几家原来要关门的商店，会后第三天就到徐州办货；百货业也有些资方到上海去办货，到乡下推销货物；绸布业店家的橱窗也堆得满满的了。该县工商联主任委员林静波说：“经过这次会议，工商界头脑清醒不少，真正了解到过去的消极经营是错误的。”
    第四、在大会期间，各种土产、手工业品，及其它物产陈列满街，好坏分明，价格统一，树立了新的商业风气。同时，又使顾客可以随意买进品质好和自己需要的货物。这样也就教育了某些生产者，注意今后品质的改进，对指导生产起了作用。人民政府又维持了治安，使农民避免了过去受私商压价、小偷扒手偷钱的损失。
    这次大会做得不够的是：一、大会没有注意抓紧农忙空隙举行，交流时间正是农民割元麦的时候，再加上准备较匆促，动员农民参观的工作做得不够。二、有些国营公司对这次大会认识不足，采取应付态度，因此减弱了这次大会应有的作用。
    现在，该县城乡物产交流促进会除了对这次所订的合同、协议监督有关方面切实执行外，还准备动员各区镇吸收这次大会的经验，继续举行同样形式的集场物产交流。（黄林、映晖、润之、王景福、易乾、丹店通讯组等）
