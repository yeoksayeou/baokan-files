Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 9th. Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, Kim Il-sung, and Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Peng Dehuai, sent a letter to Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, Clark, on the 9th. The full text is as follows:

To General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

Currently, the only obstacle preventing an agreement on the Korean armistice negotiations is the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation. We believe that our representatives should spare no effort to negotiate a resolution to this issue in order to realize the Korean armistice that the people of the world are eagerly hoping for.

In order to negotiate a solution to the prisoner-of-war repatriation issue on a reasonable basis, the representatives of both sides have reached an agreement in the negotiations to ensure that the repatriated prisoners of war from both sides will no longer participate in the Korean War so that they can return home to live a peaceful life. In order to realize this guarantee, our representatives have repeatedly proposed the most practical and fair plan: All foreign armed personnel captured by both sides (United Nations forces or Chinese People's Volunteers) should be repatriated home; All captured Korean armed personnel (South Korean army or Korean People's Army) whose homes are in the other side's area should be repatriated home; Those whose homes are in the area of the receiving side should be allowed to return home locally and need not be repatriated. This plan fully complies with the spirit of the universally recognized 1949 Geneva Convention. If your side, like our side, has the sincerity to achieve a Korean armistice, the prisoner-of-war repatriation issue should have been resolved reasonably according to this plan long ago. However, since the negotiations entered the discussion on the fourth agenda item, your representatives have unreasonably insisted on the principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation," which violates the spirit of the Geneva Convention. Since the end of March this year, our representatives, based on the above-mentioned plan proposed by our side, have proposed that each side conduct a correction of the list of prisoners of war handed over by their own side on December 18, 1951. Although your representatives agreed to correct the list of prisoners of war, they illegally announced the so-called "screening" of prisoners of war in mid-April, which is actually forcibly detaining our captured personnel. Since prisoners of war are in a situation of being captured by the opposing side, the Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war shall not, under any circumstances, renounce the rights granted by the Geneva Convention. Therefore, the principles of so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" insisted upon by your side are not only unreasonable but also inconsistent with international conventions.

For the above reasons, your representatives in the negotiation meetings refused to reason, refused to negotiate, and simply repeated the arbitrary statement that your plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel is "firm, final, and unchangeable." At the same time, they frequently proposed indefinite recesses and regular recesses to delay the negotiations. At the meeting on June 7, your representatives unilaterally announced a three-day recess without agreement from both sides, and even before our representatives could answer and even before your interpreter had finished translating your representatives' speech, they left the meeting halfway. This is an impolite and provocative act that is absolutely unacceptable in equal negotiations between the two sides.

On June 8th and 9th, your representatives continued to refuse to attend meetings in Panmunjom, which has disrupted the normal procedure of the armistice negotiations. We believe that your representatives' assertion that the plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel is "firm, final, and unchangeable" is clearly an attempt to force us to submit through intimidation, but you should know that what cannot be obtained on the battlefield cannot be obtained at the conference table either. Now, your representatives are attempting to agitate us with the act of unilaterally interrupting the meeting. Here, we must point out that equal armistice negotiations between the two sides can only reach a fair and reasonable agreement through reasoning and negotiation. Refusing to reason, refusing to negotiate, and even refusing to meet and leaving the meeting halfway does not indicate anything other than fear of facts and truth.

If your side intends to break off the negotiations by this means, then your side should publicly announce it and bear the responsibility. If your side deliberately intends to create tension in the Far East situation because of some unspeakable secrets, the result will inevitably arouse the indignation and condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world.

Thanks to our side's consistent efforts, the armistice negotiations have been able to continue to this day. Now, we still believe that the normal conduct of the meeting is absolutely necessary for the only remaining issue in the Korean armistice negotiations to be resolved quickly, fairly, and reasonably. If your side still has the sincerity to negotiate an armistice, you should order your representatives to come to Panmunjom for a meeting according to normal procedures in order to fulfill the serious responsibility that your side, as one party to the armistice negotiations, owes to the people of the world.

    美方畏惧事实和真理竟片面宣布休会三天并拒绝到会
    金日成彭德怀两将军致函克拉克
    指出美方应命令代表按正常程序前来开会以便使战俘遣返问题迅速得到公平合理的解决
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀于九日给联合国军总司令克拉克一封信，全文如下：联合国军总司令克拉克将军：
    现在阻碍着朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的，只有一个战俘遣返问题。我们认为，你我双方代表应该不遗余力地协商解决这个问题，以实现世界人民所迫切希望的朝鲜停战。
    为了在合理的基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，双方代表已在谈判中取得协议，保证双方被遣返的战俘不再参加朝鲜战争，以便他们得以回家过和平生活。我方代表为实现这一保证，曾多次提出一个最切合实际的公平方案，即：双方所俘获的外国武装人员（联合国军或中国人民志愿军）应全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员（南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军），其家在对方地区者应全部遣返回家，其家在收容方面地区者得许其就地回家，不必遣返。这个方案完全符合于举世公认的一九四九年日内瓦公约的精神。如果你方像我方一样具有实现朝鲜停战的诚意，则战俘遣返问题按着这个方案早应获得合理的解决。但你方代表，自从谈判进入有关第四项议程的讨论以来，却始终无理坚持违反日内瓦公约精神的所谓“自愿遣返”原则。今年三月下旬起，我方代表根据上述的我方所提方案，曾提议双方各就自方在一九五一年十二月十八日交出的战俘名单进行校正工作，你方代表虽然同意校正战俘名单，但在四月中却非法宣布对战俘实行所谓“甄别”，实际就是强行扣留我方被俘人员。由于战俘系处在被敌对方面俘虏的情况下，故日内瓦公约规定战俘在任何情况下均不得放弃日内瓦公约所给予的权利。因此，你方所坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”和“甄别”的原则，不仅是不合理的，而且是不合国际公约的。
    基于上述原因，你方代表在谈判会议中就拒绝说理，拒绝协商，而一味重复你方强行扣留我方被俘人员的方案是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”这种武断声明，同时，又经常提出无限期休会和定期休会等要求，来拖延谈判。在六月七日的会议上，你方代表更未经双方协议而片面宣布休会三天，并未等我方代表回答，甚至还未等你方译员译完你方代表的发言，便中途退出会场。这是在双方对等谈判中所绝对不能容许的无礼的挑衅举动。
    六月八、九两日，你方代表仍继续拒绝至板门店开会，这就使停战谈判的正常程序为之破坏。我们认为，你方代表将强行扣留我方被俘人员的方案说成是“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”，显然是企图用恐吓手段逼我屈服，但你应知道，在战场上不能取得的东西，同样在会场上也不能取得。现在，你方代表又企图以片面中断会议的举动来激动我们。我们在此，必须指出，双方对等的停战谈判，只有经过说理和协商，方能达到公平合理的协议，而拒绝说理，拒绝协商，甚至拒绝开会，中途退席，并不表示别的，而只是表示对于事实和真理的畏惧。
    如果你方意欲借此破裂谈判，那你方就应公开宣布，承当责任。如果你方因有不可告人的隐衷而欲故意造成远东局势的紧张，则所得结果必将引起全世界爱好和平人民的愤懑和责难。
    由于我方的一贯努力，停战谈判得以继续至今。现在，我们仍然认为，使朝鲜停战谈判剩下的唯一问题能够迅速得到公平合理的解决，会议的正常进行是绝对必要的。你方如尚有对于停战谈判的诚意，你就应该命令你方代表，按正常程序前来板门店开会，以履行你方作为停战谈判的一方面对于世界人民所负的严重责任。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官　金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员　彭德怀
    一九五二年六月九日
