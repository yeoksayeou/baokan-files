Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 9th - According to TASS reports from Paris: The French people are launching an increasingly broad struggle to defend peace and oppose the fascist atrocities of the Pinay government in persecuting the French Communist Party and other democratic groups.

    According to "l'Humanité," delegations of working people from the Paris urban area and its suburbs have been continuously visiting the Central Committee of the French Communist Party for days. They expressed their support for the policies of the Communist Party and resolutely protested the French authorities' illegal arrest of Communist Party Secretary Duclos and "l'Humanité" Editor-in-Chief Stil. They also constantly sent delegations to petition the National Assembly, demanding that the Assembly and the government immediately cease their policies of suppression and immediately release Duclos and Stil. Many working people donated all their savings to help the Central Committee of the French Communist Party restore the headquarters office that had been destroyed by the police.
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party constantly received telegrams and letters of support from all over the country. The mayor, municipal councilors, and local Socialist Party activists of the Saint-Magne-de-Castillon district in the Gironde department, in their letter, condemned the fascist suppression of Duclos and other patriots by the French authorities, and called on French workers and peasants to unite and overthrow fascism and war. The letter stated: "We know that every time the Communist Party is persecuted, lower-level Socialists and all democrats will soon be persecuted in the same way." Louis Saillant, Chairman of the National Council of Resistance, emphasized in his letter that the French authorities arrested Duclos at the same time that the German army was formally rebuilt, which is a direct threat to the French people.
    "Libération" published a long letter from Vigier, Chairman of the parliamentary group of the French Progressive Republican Union, to the French Attorney General, in which he emphasized that Duclos enjoyed parliamentary privileges and his arrest was illegal. Vigier also wrote another letter to the Attorney General in his capacity as a member of the Executive Committee of the French National Peace Council, protesting the police's illegal search of the offices of the National Peace Council. Vigier said: The actions of the French government show that today in France there is a conspiracy against democratic freedom, first and foremost against the freedom to defend peace.
    "l'Humanité" also published protest letters from lawyers Villar, Brugère, and others against the French police's illegal search of the Central Committee office building of the French Communist Party. The protest letter stated: "This search has proven to be a premeditated act of sabotage against the laws that guarantee the safety of citizens. ... This action is an unprecedented act of aggression since 1939-1940 against the party that received the most votes during the elections, against those organizations that united a large part of the people." The protest letter concluded that the French authorities' despicable conspiracy "is used to undermine democratic institutions and the guarantees stipulated in the constitution, so that the freedom and security of every French citizen are threatened again in the homeland, less than ten years after it was liberated from the fascist bandits."
    Soldiers from the 9th Regiment and the 405th Regiment of the garrison in Béziers, Hérault, wrote to the French Minister of Defense, expressing their full support for Duclos and other peace fighters, and resolutely stating that they "are unwilling to act as police to suppress the French working people's struggle for peace...." The soldiers of the 405th Regiment, in their letter to the Minister of Defense, called on him to recall the actions of the soldiers of the 81st Regiment in 1907, and warned: "We dare to assure you that we will follow the great example of our fathers and grandfathers." (Note: In 1907, soldiers of the 81st Regiment were ordered to go to Béziers to suppress a strike by agricultural workers, but they refused to carry out the order and stood with the strikers.)

    法国人民展开广泛斗争声援法国共产党
    抗议比内政府逮捕杜克洛的法西斯暴行
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国人民正在展开越来越广泛的斗争，来保卫和平，反对比内政府迫害法国共产党和其他民主团体的法西斯暴行。
    据“人道报”报道，巴黎市区和近郊的劳动人民代表团连日络绎不绝地访问法国共产党中央委员会。他们表示支持共产党的政策，并坚决抗议法国当局非法逮捕共产党书记杜克洛和“人道报”总编辑斯梯。他们还不断派遣代表团向国民议会请愿，要求议会和政府马上停止镇压政策，并立刻释放杜克洛和斯梯。许多劳动人民倾囊捐出他们的储蓄，帮助法国共产党中央委员会恢复被警察捣毁的总部办公处。
    法共中央委员会不断接到来自全国各地声援电报和信件。吉伦特省圣马盖区的市长、市政委员和当地社会党积极分子在他们的信里谴责法国当局对杜克洛及其他爱国人士的法西斯镇压，号召法国工人和农民团结起来，打倒法西斯主义和战争。信里说：“我们知道：每一次共产党受到迫害时，下层社会党人和一切民主分子也很快就会同样受到迫害。”全国抵抗委员会主席路易·赛扬在信里着重指出：法国当局在德国正式重建国防军的时候逮捕了杜克洛，这是对法国人民的直接威胁。
    “解放报”发表了法国进步共和联盟议会党团主席维热里写给法国检察长一封长信，其中强调指出杜克洛享有议员特权，逮捕他是非法的。维热里并以法国全国和平理事会执行委员会委员身分给检察长写了另一封信，抗议警察非法搜查全国和平理事会办公处。维热里说：法国政府的行动表明，今天在法国正存在着一种反对民主自由、首先是反对保卫和平的自由的阴谋。
    “人道报”还刊载了律师维拉尔、勃留格等多人反对法国警察非法搜查法共中央办公大楼的抗议书。抗议书说：“这次搜查已证明是一种预谋的对保证公民安全的法律横加破坏的行为。……这种行动是自从一九三九—一九四○年以来对于在选举期间获得最多票数的党、对于那些团结了很大一部分人民的组织从未有过的侵犯行为。”抗议书最后说，法国当局的卑鄙阴谋“是用来破坏民主机关和宪法规定的保证，以使每个法国公民的自由安全，在祖国刚从法西斯强盗手中解放不到十年的今天又遭到威胁。”
    爱罗尔省贝稷亚的驻军第九团和第四○五团的士兵写信给法国国防部长，表示完全支持杜克洛及其他和平战士，并且坚决表示“不愿充当警察去镇压法国劳动人民争取和平的斗争……。”第四○五团士兵在给国防部长的信里叫他回忆一下一九○七年第八十一团士兵的行动，并且警告说：“我们敢向你保证，我们要效法我们的父亲和祖父的伟大榜样。”（按：在一九○七年，第八十一团士兵奉命开到贝稷亚去镇压农业工人的罢工，可是他们拒绝执行命令，和罢工者站在一起。）
