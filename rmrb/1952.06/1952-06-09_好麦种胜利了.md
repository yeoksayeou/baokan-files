    Recently, people who have visited the rural areas of Zhengzhou's suburbs invariably ask when they see a particularly well-grown wheat field: "Why is this wheat growing better than other wheat?" And the farmers here always answer: "Because it is planted with good wheat seeds." The good wheat seeds they are referring to were selected by Lou Shangsong, a farmer in the district. Lou Shangsong is an old farmer who has been farming for forty-nine years and has been selecting seeds every year since 1950. Those who planted the good wheat seeds he selected have reaped a good harvest every year. Therefore, the local farmers are very grateful to him. At this year's Henan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference, he was elected as a production expert in Henan Province.

    "Good seeds produce good seedlings; a good gourd yields a good dipper." This saying has been circulating among farmers for who knows how many years. In the society ruled by the Kuomintang, Lou Shangsong learned the importance of selecting good seeds from experience. However, at that time, he had no land, and even if he selected good seeds and harvested more crops, they would be taken away by the landlord. Therefore, he could not and was unwilling to carefully select good wheat varieties. After liberation, the People's Government led the peasants to carry out land reform, and he was allocated more than twenty mu of farmland. Only after this did he realize his long-cherished wish of selecting seeds. He was the first person in the suburbs of Zhengzhou to respond to the People's Government's call for seed selection. In order to harvest more grain, he went to state-owned farms in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other places to collect various good wheat seeds, and also collected the best varieties from wheat-producing areas such as Shandong, northern Jiangsu, Pingyuan, and Shaanxi through his friends and relatives. Whenever the wheat ripened, he would go to the surrounding villages to investigate various good wheat seeds. However, among these numerous seeds, which one was the best and most suitable for growing in his own land? He thought that this could only be determined by experimentation. Therefore, when cultivating his three different types of soil, he left a few large plots of land to test the effectiveness of these seeds. Last year, he specially used more than two mu of land to try planting twenty kinds of wheat. Then, he selected the best among them and promoted it.

    When the wheat ripened, he picked these different wheat ears, compared their weight, counted the grains, and through field observation, he examined which kind of wheat could both prevent disease and rust and also produce a large yield. Finally, he used various methods to select the wheat that had no disadvantages. In fields where the wheat seeds were relatively mixed, he patiently carried out ear selection. If he did not have time to select ears in the field when the wheat ripened, he would select ears and remove impurities on the threshing ground. Whenever a piece or block of wheat grew relatively well, he would first pull out the mixed wheat and select it in pieces and blocks. When winnowing wheat on the threshing ground, he would select the largest wheat grains that floated to the upwind head.

    After the superior wheat seeds were tested and selected, he thought: "If all farmers planted these good seeds and had a good harvest every year, wouldn't that make the people prosperous and the country strong?" Therefore, he tried to promote them to the outside. However, his enthusiasm was rejected by many farmers with conservative ideas. Those farmers said: "Changing the wheat seeds that we have planted for a lifetime, if we don't get a harvest in one year, we will have to starve." At this time, he used the results of his own planting to convince them. In the first year, his harvest was the best in the whole district, but the farmers said: "This is God's will, this wheat should be prosperous." In order to promote his good seeds to the outside world more quickly, he gave wheat ears as gifts to his relatives and friends during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival; when these relatives and friends saw that the wheat ears he gave were better than their own, they kept them as seeds. In this way, one person told ten people, and ten people told a hundred people. His good seeds not only spread in the suburbs of Zhengzhou, but also as far south as Xinyang and as far north as parts of Pingyuan Province, farmers were using the wheat seeds he selected.

    The superior wheat varieties he has selected and promoted include two types: one is Xuzhou White Rice Wheat; the other is local Red Bald Head Wheat. These two kinds of wheat have been planted on 50,000 mu in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. This year, yellow dwarf disease occurred in the wheat in the district, and the locally planted wheat withered and died from the disease, but the seedlings of these two kinds of wheat have been growing very strong, with large ears and full grains. One farmer planted local wheat and Xuzhou White Rice Wheat in the same field, and the White Rice Wheat yielded twice as much as the local wheat. The farmer said: "The good wheat seeds selected by Lou Shangsong have indeed triumphed."

    The wheat in the suburbs of Zhengzhou has now matured. Farmers are learning from Lou Shangsong's experience in seed selection and are busy selecting seeds.

### 好麦种胜利了

    好麦种胜利了
    新华社记者　陆笑萍
    最近来过郑州市郊区农村的人，每逢看到一片麦子长得特别好的时候，就要发问：“这麦子为什么比别的麦子生长得好呢？”而这里的农民总是这样的回答：“因为种的是好麦种。”这里所说的好麦种是该区农民娄上松选出来的。娄上松是一个种了四十九年庄稼的老农民，从一九五零年以来，年年进行了选种工作。凡是种了他所选的好麦种的人，结果年年都是丰收。所以当地的农民都很感激他。今年的河南省农业劳动模范大会上，他当选为河南省的生产能手。
    “好种出好苗；好葫芦剖好瓢。”这句谚语，在农民中间，不知已经流传了多少年。在国民党统治的社会里，娄上松就从经验中懂得了选种好。但是，那时他没有地，选出好种多打庄稼，也要被地主拿走，所以他不能也不愿意去精选小麦良种。解放以后，人民政府领导农民进行了土地改革，使他分得了二十多亩耕地。这以后他才实现了多年来的选种的愿望。他是郑州市郊区最早响应人民政府选种号召的带头人。为了多打粮食，他曾到开封、郑州等地公营农场收集多种好麦种，并且通过他的朋友、亲戚搜集了山东、苏北、平原、陕西等产麦区的最好品种，每当麦熟的时候，他还要到周围村庄去调查各种好麦种。但是，这些名目繁多的种籽里，究竟那一样最好最适合在自己的土地里生长呢？他想，这只有进行试验。于是把他的三种不同土质的地，在耕种时都留下几分大的一块地头，用以试验这些种籽的效果。去年他专用二亩多地试种了二十种麦子。然后再把其中最好的选出来，并加以推广。
    在麦熟的时候，他就把这些不同的麦穗摘下来，比重量，数麦粒；并且通过实地观察，看那种麦子既能防病、免锈而收成又大。最后他就用各种方法把毫无弊端的麦子选出来。在麦种比较杂的田地里，他耐心地进行穗选，如果在麦熟时来不及田间穗选，那他就在场上选穗去杂。逢到一片或一块地的麦子长得都比较好的时候，他就先把其中的杂麦拔出，成片成块的选起来。在场里扬麦时，他就把飘在上风头的麦粒中最大的选出来。
    优良麦种经试种并选出后，他就想：“这些好种如果所有的农民都种了，年年有好收成，不是就民富国强了吗？”于是他就设法向外推广。但是，他的热心被许多有保守思想的农民拒绝了。那些农民说：“种一辈子的麦种把它换了，一年不得收，就要喝西北风了。”这时他就以自己种植的效果去说服他们。第一年全区以他的收成为最好，农民还说：“这是天意，该这种麦子旺。”他为了把自己的良种快些向外推广，每年端阳节和中秋节的时候，他向亲戚、朋友送的礼物就是麦穗；这些亲戚和朋友看见他送的麦穗比自家的好，也就留做种籽了。用这种方法来一传十十传百，他的良种不仅在郑州市郊传播起来，而且南至信阳，北到平原省部分农民也用着他所选出的麦种。
    经他选出的小麦良种，已经推广了的有两种：一是徐州白米小麦；一是本地红秃头小麦。这两种麦子，在郑州市郊区已经种了五万亩。今年该区小麦发生了黄疸病，本地种的麦子都病得枯死了，这两种麦子的棵苗一直长得非常茁壮，穗大粒饱。有一家农民在同样的一块地里种了本地麦种和徐州白米麦种，白米麦比本地麦多收了一倍。这个农民说：“娄上松选的好麦种确是胜利了。”
    郑州市郊区的麦子，现在已经成熟了。农民们学习了娄上松选种的经验，都忙着选种了。
