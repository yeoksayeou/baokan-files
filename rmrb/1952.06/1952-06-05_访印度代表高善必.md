Interview with Indian Representative D.D. Kosambi

“I bring the sincere wishes of the Indian people for the victory of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. In our view, such a conference should have been held long ago.” Professor D.D. Kosambi emphasized the urgency of holding the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in his conversation with reporters.

D.D. Kosambi is one of India's most prominent peace activists and a member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. In India, he has been serving as the Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council. He was the chief representative of the Indian delegation at this Asian and Pacific Peace Conference preparatory meeting.

He gave reporters a brief overview of the development of the peace movement in India: The peace movement in India is carried out under the leadership of the World Peace Council. Its contribution to the world peace movement is reflected in its enthusiastic support for the Stockholm Appeal, the resolutions of the Warsaw Peace Congress, and the call for a Five-Power Peace Pact. More than two million signatures have been collected in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact, but their goal is to reach eleven million. Many "volunteers" are working for peace in India. For example, one female "volunteer," due to her selfless efforts, collected more than 50,000 signatures in support of the Five-Power Peace Pact on her own. In his conversation, he said very firmly: "As you know, India has many different nationalities and languages. However, I can say on behalf of the vast masses of the Indian people – regardless of nationality and language – that the vast majority of us demand peace, especially peace and solidarity with our great neighbor, China."

D.D. Kosambi is also a renowned scientist. Therefore, he naturally mentioned that Indian scientists have also begun to recognize the importance of striving for peace. To prove this, he showed reporters a summary of a report recently adopted at the annual meeting of the Indian medical community. This report calls on all doctors to play an active role in the peace movement. However, he said, "Our scientists have not yet done their utmost for peace. Therefore, one of our current tasks is to mobilize them to work for peace."

Overall, the development of the peace movement in India is not without its difficulties; however, as D.D. Kosambi said, "The peace movement in India has already passed its infancy." The enthusiastic response of people all over India to the holding of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference reflects the continuous development of the peace movement in India. Professor D.D. Kosambi said that in order to strengthen the preparations for this peace conference, they have suggested holding an All-India Peace Conference before the official conference. All peace-loving people in India have high hopes for this Asian and Pacific Peace Conference. He said: "If this conference can accomplish its mission, it will be a huge step in the process of striving for peace and a great leap forward in the creation of human history. One of the many great achievements of this conference should be to unite all Asian countries to fight together for peace." Speaking of this, D.D. Kosambi more specifically put forward the current urgent demands of the Asian people: "We want to declare: We want peace, we oppose imperialism, we oppose the colonial system of oppression, and we oppose interference in the internal affairs of any country under any pretext."

This desire of the Indian people for peace is inseparable from their demand for improved living standards. Professor D.D. Kosambi told us that the living conditions of the general Indian people are very difficult. Just two months ago, food prices in many areas rose by 25 to 50 percent. In some places, there is a shortage of food, and people have to use leaves to satisfy their hunger. However, D.D. Kosambi said: "We believe that this situation can be greatly improved through free and equal international trade, especially trade between India and China."

The topic turned to how to continue to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, which has a long history and is of great significance for safeguarding peace in Asia. D.D. Kosambi pointed out that the development of this friendship has a very solid foundation; because "the people of China and India are both fighting for a common goal – peace."

To further strengthen this friendly relationship, he believes that it is mainly through "free and equal exchanges," which are mainly manifested in two aspects: culture and trade.

“Regarding cultural exchanges, some people say that the difficulty lies in language and distance. In fact, this has not prevented cultural exchanges between our two countries.” Then, D.D. Kosambi gave a vivid example. He said: "My name 'Kosambi' is a good proof, proving that our two peoples have a long history of exchanges. Sixteen hundred years ago, many Chinese Buddhists traveled thousands of miles to India to 'pilgrimage.' 'Kosambi' is the name of the town where they gathered in India. And today, Kosambi, this 'pilgrim,' has come to China to travel. If distance could be overcome at that time, it is even less of a problem to overcome this difficulty today."

The same is true of language, he said: "As far as I know, an Indian professor is teaching Hindi at a Chinese university, and I see no reason why we cannot invite Chinese professors to teach Chinese in India." Then, he said: "India has already sent cultural delegations to China, and China has already sent cultural delegations to India. I hope our government will invite more Chinese delegations to India. We can even exchange our movies, football teams, etc."

Professor D.D. Kosambi particularly emphasized that he hopes to see rapid development in trade between China and India, and the prospects for this development are extremely broad. "China can supply India with food, and India can supply China with certain items that cannot be fully manufactured at present." He said that commercial exchanges between China and India also have a long history, "Indians knew very early on that China was a silk-producing country, while India was known for its cotton production. Tea came from China, and sugar seems to have come from India." "I see no reason why we cannot continue to expand this cultural and trade exchange, which will enrich the lives of our people."

Although the conversation with Professor D.D. Kosambi was short, it left a deep impression on the reporter: The vast majority of the Indian people are determined to demand peace and oppose war. Like the Chinese people and the people of all countries, they are working bravely for the common goal of freeing mankind from new wars and giving everyone a better life. This desire of the Indian people is fully expressed in the resolution adopted by the Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council on May 5, which states:

“To achieve this goal, the people of Asia must unite. They must transcend the obstacles and distinctions of nationality, language, culture, and different economic systems, and loudly and bravely oppose all forms of war threats. They must consolidate the peace forces of Asia. Therefore, we must unite with our friends in other parts of the world to ensure the victory of our common cause.” (Zhang Yan)

    访印度代表高善必
    “我带来了印度人民祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议取得胜利的诚挚愿望。在我们看来，这样的会议早就应该召开了。”高善必教授在与记者们谈话中强调指出了召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的迫切性。
    高善必是印度著名的和平人士之一，是世界和平理事会执行局委员。在印度，他一直担任着全印和平理事会的副主席。在这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，他是印度代表团的首席代表。
    他概括地给记者描述了印度和平运动的发展情况：印度的和平运动是在世界和平理事会领导下进行的。它对世界和平运动的贡献表现在它对斯德哥尔摩宣言、华沙和平大会的决议，以及对于要求缔结五大国和平公约的热烈支持。拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名已经超过二百万，但是他们的目标是要达到一千一百万。在印度出现着许多为和平而工作的“志愿军”。例如，有一个女“志愿军”，由于她忘我的努力，她一个人征集了五万个以上拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名者。在他的谈话中，他很坚定地说：“诚如你们所知，印度有许多不同的民族和语言。然而，我可以代表印度广大的人民群众——不分民族和语言——说，我们绝大多数是要求和平的，特别是要求与我们伟大的邻邦——中国之间的和平与团结。”
    高善必同时也是著名的科学家。所以，他很自然地说到印度科学家们也已开始认识到争取和平的重要性。为了证明这一点，他给记者看了一份不久前在印度医药界年会上通过的一份报告的摘要。这个报告要求所有的医生都在和平运动中起积极作用。不过，他说：“我们的科学家们还没有为和平尽最大的力量。因此，我们当前的任务之一是要动员他们来为和平而努力。”
    整个来说，和平运动在印度的开展并不是没有困难的；然而，正如高善必所说，“印度的和平运动业已越过了它的幼年阶段。”印度各地人民对于召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的热烈响应正反映了印度和平运动正在不断地向前发展。高善必教授说，为了加强对于这个和平大会的准备工作，他们已建议在正式大会举行以前召开一次全印和平大会。所有印度爱好和平的人民都对这个亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议寄与很高的期望。他说：“假如这个会议能完成它的任务，那将是在争取和平的过程中跨了极大的一步，也是在人类历史创造过程中跃进了极大的一步。这个会议底许多伟大成就之一，应该是使所有亚洲的国家团结起来为和平而共同奋斗。”说到这里，高善必更加具体地提出了亚洲人民当前的迫切要求：“我们要宣布：我们是要和平的，我们反对帝国主义，我们反对殖民地压迫制度，我们反对在任何藉口下干涉任何国家的内政。”
    印度人民这种对于和平的愿望是和他们对于提高生活水准的要求分不开的。高善必教授告诉我们说，印度一般人民的生活情况是很困难的。仅仅两个月前，在许多地区食物的价格就上涨了百分之二十五到五十。有的地方粮食不足，人们必须用树叶充饥。不过，高善必说：“我们认为，通过国际间自由而平等的贸易，特别是印度与中国之间的贸易，是可以大大地改善这种情况的。”
    话题转向如何继续加强已经有着悠久历史而且对于保卫亚洲和平具有重大意义的中印两国人民之间的友谊。高善必指出，这个友谊的发展是具有极其坚实的基础的；因为“中印两国人民都在为着一个共同的目标——和平而奋斗”。
    要进一步加强这个友好关系，他认为主要是通过“自由而平等的交流”，而这主要表现在两方面：文化与贸易。
     “关于文化交流，有人说困难在于语言和距离。其实，这并没有能阻止我们两国的文化交流。”接着，高善必举了一个生动的例子，他说：“我的名字‘高善必’就是一个很好的证明，证明我们两国人民有悠久的交往历史。一千六百年前许多中国的佛教徒不远千里跋涉到印度去“朝圣”，‘高善必’就是他们在印度聚居的那个城镇的名字。而今天高善必这个‘香客’却到中国来游历了。假如距离在那时候就能克服，在今天来说，克服这种困难那就更不成问题了。”
    语言也是一样，他说：“据我所知，一个印度教授正在中国大学里教着印地文，我看不出有任何理由我们不能邀请中国教授去印度教中文。”接着，他说：“印度已有文化代表团来中国，中国也已有文化代表团到印度，我希望我们的政府将邀请更多的中国代表团到印度去。甚至我们还可以交流我们的电影，足球队等等。”
    高善必教授特别强调地指出，他希望看见中印两国间的贸易得到迅速的发展，而这种发展的前途是极其宽广的。“中国能够以粮食供给印度，印度可以供给中国某些目前不能充分制造的物品。”他说，中印两国间的商业来往也是具有悠久历史的，“印度人很早就知道中国是产丝的国家，印度却以产棉著称。茶是从中国来的，糖似乎是从印度来。”“我看不出有任何理由我们不能继续扩大这种文化和贸易的交流，这种交流将丰富我们人民的生活。”
    和高善必教授的谈话虽然很短，但是却已经给记者留下了一个很深的印象：广大的印度人民是坚决要求和平、反对战争的。同中国人民以及各国人民一样，他们正在为使人类免于新的战争、人人获得较好的生活这个共同的目标而勇敢地工作着。印度人民的这种愿望充分地表现在全印和平理事会执行局五月五日所通过的决议中，这个决议说：
    “为了达到这个目的，亚洲人民必须团结起来。他们必须超越国籍、语言、文化和不同的经济制度的障碍和区分，大声疾呼地英勇地反对各种形式的战争威胁，他们必须巩固亚洲的和平力量，因此，我们必须与世界其他部分的友人团结起来，保证我们的共同事业获得胜利。”（张彦）
