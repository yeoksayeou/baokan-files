State-owned Qingdao Textile Factories Promote Preparation Workshop Methods
Greatly Aiding the Consolidation and Improvement of the 1951 Weaving Method

    The Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, after summarizing the working methods of winding, warping, and sizing in the preparation workshops of textile factories, formulated the preparation workshop working methods and promoted them, which played an important role in consolidating and improving the 1951 weaving method.
    The improvement of preparation workshop working methods is key to the weaving workshop workers fully realizing the superiority of the 1951 weaving method. Since the promotion of winding, warping, and sizing working methods, the preparation workshops of Qingdao's textile factories have been able to produce high-quality raw materials for the weaving workshops.
    The winding working method mainly involves improving the knotting method and procedure. Workers previously used regular knots, but after adopting the new working method, they use reverse knots, which make the knot tighter as it is pulled, making it stronger than regular knots. Before the promotion of the winding working method, the average knot-slipping rate of each factory reached 7.34 percent due to poor knots. After the promotion, it has dropped to 2.165 percent. The waste thread from joining has also been reduced. In the past, each joint required wasting seven or eight inches of waste thread, but after the promotion of the new working method, it has been reduced to less than two inches. At the same time, workers have adopted "segmented joining," with a specific patrol route when joining, making work regular and avoiding random movement.
    The warping working method emphasizes removing defective yarn during warping. If defective yarn is found during warping, the machine is stopped and the yarn is removed to avoid back-winding. If the defective yarn has already been wound onto the warp beam, it is immediately back-wound and removed. This can reduce breaks during weaving and improve the quality of the cloth. Before the promotion of the warping working method, workers did not pay attention to defective yarn, and each machine in each factory averaged 131 neps per day. After the promotion, workers paid attention to detecting defective yarn, averaging 300 to 500 neps per machine per day. At the same time, during warping, workers adopted the method of inserting a paper strip every 2,000 yards, so that the sizing workers can have a clear idea when the warp beam arrives at the sizing machine, which is convenient for rational adjustment. When changing the bobbin and joining, workers also adopted the twisting and joining method. Therefore, the warping quality has been improved by 50.2 percent. The waste thread from joining during warping has also been reduced from the original seven or eight inches to less than four inches.
    The characteristics of the sizing working method are the correct control of the elongation rate, moisture regain, and size absorption rate of the sizing, and attention to reducing waste thread. In the past, workers had the incorrect idea of "rather dry than wet" in controlling the moisture regain. The new sizing working method stipulates that the moisture regain of sizing should be 7.5 to 8.5 percent in the dry season (September to May of the following year) and 7 to 8 percent in the wet season (May to September). The difference in size absorption rate should not exceed 2 percent of the standard. The sizing rate should be reduced as much as possible, provided that it does not affect weaving in the weaving workshop. Therefore, after the promotion of the new working method, the average sizing rate of 23-count yarn in each factory has been reduced from above 22 percent to about 20 percent.
    In the process of promoting these three working methods, various textile factories also encountered some difficulties and ideological obstacles. At the beginning, because workers were not proficient in using the new working methods, the quality of the products improved compared to before, but the output decreased, which affected the workers' wage income. At the same time, after the quality of the products in the preparation workshop improved, the output of the weaving workshop also increased day by day, forming a situation where the products of the preparation workshop could not meet the needs of the weaving workshop. As a result, individual workers and technicians wavered in their confidence in promoting the new working methods, saying: "Is it really good to tie reverse knots? How much money can be saved by saving waste thread? Who is responsible for affecting production if the supply is insufficient?" After learning about these situations, the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau immediately decided to further promote this new working method, and decided to pay the workers their original wages during the trial period of the new working method (within two weeks). The administrative aspects of each factory also gave strong support to the promotion work. At present, the output of the preparation workshops in many factories has returned to its original level. It is estimated that after the workers are proficient in using the new working methods, the output will definitely exceed the original level, and the cost can be reduced by 30 to 40 percent.
    The new working methods in the preparation workshops have played a great role in the in-depth promotion of the 1951 weaving method in the weaving workshops of various textile factories. In May, state-owned Qingdao textile factories increased the average daily output of each loom by more than one yard of cloth, and the rate of second-class cloth generally dropped to below 1 percent. At present, the working methods of the preparation workshop have been gradually promoted in state-owned textile factories in Qingdao. (Ding Wen)

    国营青岛各纺织厂推广准备车间工作法
    对巩固和提高一九五一织布工作法有很大作用
    华东纺织管理局青岛分局、中国纺织工会青岛市委员会，总结了纺织厂准备车间的络经、整经、浆纱工作方法，制定准备车间工作法，加以推广，对巩固和提高一九五一织布工作法起了重要的作用。
    准备车间工作法的改进，是织布车间工人充分发挥一九五一织布工作法优越性的关键。青岛市各纺织厂准备车间，自推广了络经、整经、浆纱工作法以后，便能产出品质优良的原料，供应织布车间。
    络经工作法，主要是改进打结头的方法和程序。工人过去是打正结，采用新工作法以后，打反结头，便使结头处愈拉愈紧，比打正结的结头结实。没有推广络经工作法以前，各厂因结头不良，平均脱结率达到百分之七点三四，推广以后已降到百分之二点一六五。接头的回丝也减少了，过去每接一根头要浪费七、八寸回丝，推广新工作法以后已降到二寸以下。同时，工人们采用了“分段接头”，接头时有一定的巡回路线，工作起来有规律，不乱跑。
    整经工作法，是在整经时重视取掉疵纱（不好的纱）。在整经时，如发现疵纱，就关车拿下来，以免打倒车；如果疵纱已卷到经轴上，那么就立即打倒车拿下来。这样，可使织布时减少断头，布的质量也可以提高。没有推广整经工作法以前，由于工人不注意疵纱，各厂平均每天每台机器拤毛纱一百三十一根，推广后，工人注意发现疵纱，平均每天每台机器拤三百根至五百根。同时，在整经时，工人采用每隔二千码夹一纸条的办法，使经轴到浆纱车上时，掌握浆纱的工人可以心中有数，便于合理调节。换筒接头时，工人又采用了捻接头法。因此，整经质量提高了百分之五十点二。整经时的接头回丝也由原七、八寸长降到四寸以下。
    浆纱工作法的特点，是正确掌握浆纱的伸长率、合水率、吸浆率，并注意减少回丝。过去，工人在掌握合水率上，有“宁干勿湿”的不正确的想法，新的浆纱工作法规定浆纱合水率干季（九月至次年五月）为百分之七点五至八点五，湿季（五月至九月）为百分之七至八。吸浆率的差异上下不超过标准百分之二。上浆率尽量降低到不影响织布车间织布为原则。因此，在推广新工作法后，各厂二十三支纱平均上浆率，已由百分之二十二以上减到百分之二十左右。
    各纺织厂在推广这三个工作法中，也遇到了一些困难和思想障碍。开始，因为工人运用新工作法不熟练，产品质量虽较以前提高，但产量却降低了，因而工人的工资收入也受到了影响。同时，准备车间产品质量提高后，织布车间的产量也便天天提高，形成准备车间的产品供应不上织布车间的需要。于是，个别工人和技术人员，就动摇了推广新工作法的信心，说：“打反结头是否真正好？节约回丝能值多少钱，供应不上影响生产谁负责？”华东纺织管理局青岛分局，了解了这些情况以后，就立即决定深入推广这一新工作法，并决定工人在试用新工作法期间（二星期内）发给原工资。各厂行政方面也对推广工作予以大力支持。目前，很多工厂准备车间的产量，已恢复到原有的水平。估计工人运用新工作法熟练以后，产量定能超过原有水平，成本可降低百分之三十到四十。
    准备车间新工作法，对各纺织厂织布车间深入推广一九五一织布工作法，起了很大的作用。五月份，国营青岛各纺织厂，平均每台布机每天增产一码多布，次布普遍降到百分之一以下。现在，准备车间的工作法已在青岛各国营纺织厂逐步推广。（丁文）
