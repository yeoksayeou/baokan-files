Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Pingyuan and Other Provinces Deeply Examine Bureaucratic Work Style Through the Zhang Shunyou Incident

[By Our Own Correspondent] The incident of Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver in Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, being obstructed by bureaucratic elements when reporting a counter-revolutionary element, has drawn the attention of leading organs in Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, and other provinces after investigation and criticism by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The provinces are beginning to use this typical case to deeply examine bureaucratic work styles.

The Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on June 4th regarding a deep examination of bureaucratic work styles that disregard mass opinion. The decision pointed out: This incident has profound educational significance for the entire party, all staff members, and all people in Chahar Province. Similar incidents are by no means isolated or accidental in Chahar Province. The decision requires party organizations at all levels to conduct serious examinations of bureaucracy in various tasks centered on this incident and to complete them by the end of June. The Chahar Daily editorial department also published an open letter calling on readers to report bureaucratic elements. On June 10th, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an urgent notice to local committees, municipal committees, and county committees, ordering them to quickly report on the inspection of bureaucracy. On the same day, the Chahar Provincial People's Government also issued "Instructions on Deeply Examining the Bureaucratic Work Style of Separating from the Masses," stipulating that people's governments at all levels should combine democratic make-up lessons and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of bureaucratic work styles that separate from the masses before the end of June. During the inspection, if any letters from the masses or proposals from people's representatives have not been processed or have been improperly processed, special personnel should be assigned to handle them quickly and seriously. Based on the results of the inspection, all systems should be established and improved. On June 10th and 11th, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chahar Provincial People's Government respectively convened responsible cadres from directly affiliated units to report on the inspection of bureaucratic work styles and made further arrangements. The Chahar Provincial Consultative Committee, the Chahar Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, and the Chahar Provincial Committee of the New Democratic Youth League also called on various systems to conduct a comprehensive inspection of mass work. At present, the struggle against bureaucracy has begun to unfold in Chahar, and the people are actively responding to the call to report bureaucratic elements. The direct organs of the Chahar South Special Office initially revealed the serious bureaucratic work styles in the health and epidemic prevention organs and the native product company. Leading cadres of the native product company damaged more than 8,000 catties of Anemarrhena (medicinal material) due to disregarding workers' rational suggestions. Sun Jincheng of Yuxian County revealed the bureaucratic phenomenon of the Yuxian County Production Office wasting mass manpower and material resources; Chang Shiqian of the Xiahuayuan Mining Bureau revealed the extremely bad bureaucratic work style of Wu Zirui, the acting dean of the hospital of the bureau's employees. The People's Supervision Committee of the Chahar Provincial People's Government has also made a decision to punish those who neglected their duties in the Zhang Shunyou incident.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government held an administrative meeting on June 9th to discuss the Zhang Shunyou incident. Ma Lin, deputy director of the People's Supervision Committee of the Provincial People's Government, gave a detailed report on the entire process of the Zhang Shunyou incident. Pei Lisheng, chairman of the Provincial People's Government, called on all staff members in the province to learn from the Zhang Shunyou incident, connect with reality, conduct serious inspections and in-depth discussions, and made four instructions: 1. The personnel involved in the Zhang Shunyou incident should immediately reflect on their actions and submit written self-criticisms to the Provincial People's Supervision Committee for handling. 2. The Provincial People's Supervision Committee should propose preliminary handling opinions based on the facts and the degree of errors committed by the parties involved. 3. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Committee should make a decision to overcome bureaucracy based on the lessons of the Zhang Shunyou incident. 4. Staff members of all organs should, in accordance with the speech made by Tao Lujia, deputy secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the provincial cadre meeting on June 6th, combine with the Zhang Shunyou incident, connect with the actual situation of their departments, launch discussions throughout the province, fight against bureaucracy, and formulate effective measures to overcome bureaucracy. The vast number of staff members in Shanxi Province responded to Chairman Pei Lisheng's call and have begun to inspect bureaucratic work styles. Wang Peizao, a staff member of the Standing Committee of the People's Representatives Conference of Shenchi County responsible for handling letters from people's representatives and the masses, examined his bureaucratic work style in connection with the Zhang Shunyou incident. Some units have also formulated measures to overcome bureaucracy. The Shanxi Daily is organizing readers to discuss the Zhang Shunyou incident, and the personnel who made mistakes in the Zhang Shunyou incident in the newspaper have also made self-criticisms.

The Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has convened the units related to the Zhang Shunyou incident for inspection, instructed these units to write written self-criticisms, and proposed preliminary handling opinions for the party members who made mistakes. The Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is also preparing to notify the party of this incident, report it at a larger cadre conference, and combine it with democratic make-up lessons to promote further and comprehensive inspections of bureaucratic work styles in various units and strengthen the mass viewpoint. After the incident was revealed, the Gui Sui Municipal Public Security Bureau held two bureau affairs meetings for discussion, and relevant personnel and responsible party cadres conducted self-criticisms separately. The party organization within the Gui Sui Municipal People's Government has also convened a meeting to arrange for the study of relevant documents, requiring everyone to inspect their own bureaucratic errors in connection, and preparing to comprehensively launch an inspection of bureaucratic work styles.

The Pingyuan Daily reprinted the materials and comments on the Zhang Shunyou incident published in this newspaper on June 2nd. On the same day, the Propaganda Department of the Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to local party committees and party groups at all levels, requiring them to seriously organize study in combination with the Zhang Shunyou incident when conducting democratic make-up lessons, inspections, and exposing bureaucratic errors at the end of the "Three-Anti" movement.
