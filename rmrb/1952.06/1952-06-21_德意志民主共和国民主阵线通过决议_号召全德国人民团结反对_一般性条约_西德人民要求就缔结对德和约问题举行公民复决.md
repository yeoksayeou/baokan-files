Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: According to TASS, the Democratic Front, the organization of the united front of anti-fascist democratic parties and groups in the German Democratic Republic, recently held a meeting where it unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution, after pointing out that the purpose of the "General Treaty" and the "European Army" treaty signed by Adenauer is to deepen the division of Germany and rearm West Germany, states: These sinister plans must not be allowed to materialize. The German people do not want to be involved in imperialist war plans. The Soviet Union's repeated notes to the Western Three Powers on the issue of a German peace treaty point out the way to a peaceful resolution of the German question. We are grateful for the Soviet government's great initiative and proposals, which enable the German people to effectively defend their national interests in accordance with international law.

The Democratic Front welcomes the movement initiated by West German patriots to hold a referendum on the issue of overturning the "General Treaty" and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The Democratic Front's resolution then points out that the Adenauer government is a government hostile to the German people. For the fundamental interests of the entire nation, the people must rise up and overthrow this government themselves. If all peace-loving people in East and West Germany unite, establish close and militant cooperation, and rise up to defend peace, then the people will be able to prevent the ratification and implementation of these military treaties, and will be able to overthrow the evil Adenauer government. This will clear the way for holding an all-German conference.

The Democratic Front's resolution concludes: Because the Western countries have decided to establish an aggressive mercenary army led by fascist generals in West Germany and hand it over to the plague general Ridgway to command, the German Democratic Republic is primarily threatened, and the German Democratic Republic has no choice but to establish its own armed forces. The establishment of its own armed forces by the German Democratic Republic to defend its borders and the cause of peace will greatly promote the cause of defending peace. The Democratic Front welcomes and supports the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Free German Youth League and the declaration calling on young people to join the People's Police. The Democratic Front said in its resolution: The slogan of the recent conference in Leipzig, "Always ready to defend our homeland, always ready to defend peace!" should become the slogan of all German patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: News from Berlin: The people of West Germany are launching a movement demanding that a referendum be held throughout West Germany so that the West German people can use the rights stipulated in the Bonn "Constitution" to reject the "General Treaty" illegally signed by the Adenauer government with the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, and to promptly conclude a peace treaty with Germany. This demand was first put forward by the "Conference for Promoting Mutual Understanding Among the German People and Concluding a Just Peace Treaty," an organization of prominent figures in West German society. It immediately received the support and response of people from a wide range of strata in West Germany. The Central Committee of the West German People Against Remilitarization and for a Peace Treaty, which last year presided over the West German people's voting movement, also issued a letter to the West German people on June 9, calling on the West German people to rise up and use a referendum to oppose Adenauer and prevent the ratification of the "General Treaty." At the same time, under the leadership of the production committees and workers' representatives of enterprises in various places, preparatory committees for holding referendums have been established in various parts of West Germany. In the large-scale youth demonstrations held in the various states of West Germany, young people of various political and religious beliefs expressed their enthusiastic support for the proposal to hold a referendum. At present, the movement demanding a referendum is developing in depth throughout West Germany, and it has become a central goal in the West German people's powerful struggle against the "General Treaty" and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    德意志民主共和国民主阵线通过决议
    号召全德国人民团结反对“一般性条约”
    西德人民要求就缔结对德和约问题举行公民复决
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国反法西斯民主党派团体统一战线的组织——民主阵线最近举行会议，会上一致通过了一项决议。决议在指出阿登纳签订的“一般性条约”及“欧洲军”条约目的在加深德国的分裂和重新武装西德以后说：这些罪恶的计划决不能听任其实现。德国人民不愿牵涉到帝国主义的战争计划里。苏联就对德和约问题历次致西方三国的照会，指出了和平解决德国问题的途径。苏联政府这种伟大的主动的行动和建议，使德国人民能根据国际法来有效地保卫他们的民族利益，这是我们要感谢的。
    民主阵线在其决议中对西德爱国人士发起就推翻“一般性条约”和缔结对德和约问题举行公民复决的运动，表示欢迎。民主阵线的决议接着指出，阿登纳政府是一个敌视德国人民的政府。为了全民族的基本利益，人民必须自己起来推翻这个政府。如果东、西德国全体爱好和平的人民都团结起来，建立密切的战斗性合作，并起来保卫和平，那么人民就能够阻止这些军事性条约的批准和实施，就能够推翻万恶的阿登纳政府。这样就能为举行全德会议扫清道路。
    民主阵线的决议最后说：由于西方国家决定在西德成立法西斯将领统率下的侵略雇佣军，并且把它交给瘟疫将军李奇微去指挥，德意志民主共和国就首先受到威胁，德意志民主共和国不得不建立自己的武装部队。德意志民主共和国为了保卫自己的国境与和平事业而建立本国的武装部队，这就会大大地促进保卫和平的事业。民主阵线欢迎并支持自由德国青年联盟第四届代表大会的各项决议以及号召青年参加人民警察的宣言。民主阵线在自己的决议中说：最近在来比锡举行的这次大会的口号：“时刻准备保卫我们的祖国，时刻准备保卫和平！”应该成为全体德国爱国者的口号。
    【新华社二十日讯】柏林消息：西德人民正在展开一个运动，要求在西德全境举行公民复决，以便西德人民得以利用波恩“宪法”所规定的权利，来否决阿登纳政府与美英法三国政府非法签订的“一般性条约”，并迅速缔结对德和约。这个要求最先是由西德社会名流组织的“促进德国人民互相了解与缔结公正和约大会”提出的。它立即获得西德各地广泛阶层人民的支持和响应。曾在去年主持了西德人民投票运动的西德人民反对重新军国主义化争取缔结和约中央委员会并在六月九日发表告西德人民书，号召西德人民起来用公民复决来反对阿登纳，来阻止批准“一般性条约”。同时，在各地生产委员会及企业工人代表的领导下，西德各地纷纷成立了准备举行公民复决的筹备委员会。在西德各州所举行的青年大示威中，各种不同政治及宗教信仰的青年都表示热烈拥护举行公民复决的提议。目前，要求举行公民复决的运动正在西德全境深入展开，它在西德人民反对“一般性条约”、争取缔结对德和约的强大斗争中已成为一个中心目标。
