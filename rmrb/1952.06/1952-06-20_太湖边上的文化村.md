    Cultural Village by Taihu Lake
    Min Hailin, Zhou Tieshan
    Houhe Village is a small village in the eastern suburbs of Yixing City, Southern Jiangsu. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this village had only a single-level primary school with twenty-six or seven students (most of whom were children of the landlord class). Illiteracy and semi-literacy accounted for more than 80% of the village population. After liberation, the village suffered a severe famine. The People's Government put forward the slogan "Overcoming the famine is overcoming the enemy," and mobilized the masses to overcome the difficulties and survive the disaster. The People's Government further mobilized the masses to establish peasant spare-time schools using revolutionary methods. Without desks and benches, everyone built stone piers to replace them; without funds to buy lamp oil, everyone voluntarily brought out their own oil. While continuously overcoming difficulties, a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture gradually unfolded.
    Now, the face of the village has completely changed, and it has become a cultural village. As soon as you step into the village, you will feel a fresh atmosphere. The walls of the farmers' association are covered with wall posters and propaganda cartoons. At the main intersections and wharves, there are 130 mobile literacy boards and four mobile small blackboards, on which are written characters related to production movements; characters are written on trees, next to vegetables, and on houses, marking the names of objects, so that people know what the characters are at a glance.
    Learning culture has become a universal requirement of the people in the village, who say, "You can't manage your household well without culture." Village head Zhou Xiaolai said, "In the past, the landlord forced my family of six to have nothing to eat or wear, and we spent the winter sleeping in straw. Now I am honored to be the village head. If I don't learn culture, how can I better serve the people?" Now, 276 people in the village (98% of whom are young and middle-aged) are participating in learning, including 56 couples studying together. Out of the 155 households in the village, 71 households have enrolled the entire family. Farmers who were originally illiterate can now recognize more than 800 characters. Shen Tiangen, who originally didn't know a single character, can now recognize 2,500 characters.
    Learning has become a common habit for everyone. They all say, "Going to class is like eating; you can't get through the day without going to class." Every evening, the village is filled with loud singing. The students of the people's school sing and go to the spare-time school in groups. They apply the culture they have learned from the people's school to their daily lives. "Every family has a blackboard newspaper, literacy signs everywhere." They use green coal water glue to paint small blackboards on the walls, and often practice writing on them. Student Zhu Feng'e said, "It's really convenient to write on a small blackboard with chalk; if you write a character wrong, you don't need an eraser."
    When the county's people's schools held political tests, the Houhe Village People's School's overall average score ranked in the first class, and the women's class scored above 90 points. In the past, they often said, "It is more difficult for farmers to learn culture than for a donkey to learn to roar like a lion." Now, farmers are also carrying pens. They usually carry hoes to the fields, and put down their hoes to learn culture, just like primary school students. The village has also opened a reading room in a temple, made 32 wooden boards for reviewing characters, and added several blackboard newspapers. What everyone likes most is the radio. Every holiday, the farmers of Houhe Village gather together to listen to broadcast reports. They say, "We can even hear Chairman Mao's speeches!" The reading room regularly carries newspapers and periodicals such as "Cultural Learning," "Worker-Peasant Pictorial," "East China Farmer," "Southern Jiangsu Masses," and "Southern Jiangsu Daily." There are more than 400 comic books. Whenever it rains or during slack seasons, the reading room is often crowded with viewers.
    Every Spring Festival, the farmers' troupe uses performances to conduct propaganda for the masses. More than 80% of the students in the village have joined the troupe. Many women who never went out of the house have not only gained culture through learning but can also perform plays. Some say, "In the end, you have to study. If you don't study, you won't understand anything. You even blush when you say a few words!" Through the troupe's propaganda and education, the people of the village have broken superstitions. Now no one in the village burns tin foil anymore; the publicity of the Marriage Law has also educated the masses, making them understand the benefits of new marriages. Wu Fendi and Sun Yugen, who were oppressed by old marriages, have been liberated, and five young men and women have also found their beloved partners.
    The cultural learning of the farmers in Houhe Village is closely integrated with production tasks. As soon as you enter the village, you see more than 100 wall posters written along the river walls, as well as 13 propaganda cartoons. These poems and paintings have played a considerable role in mobilizing everyone for production. Mobile literacy boards and small blackboards are placed everywhere on the roads and wharves, and what is written on them is related to production. The close integration of cultural activities and production activities has greatly increased the farmers' enthusiasm for production. The 1,751 cubic meter earthwork project was completed in three and a half days, creating the highest record of work efficiency in the district for opening rivers.
    "Don't forget to learn while producing, learn for the sake of production" is the common slogan of all the residents of the village. They have achieved both learning and production without neglecting either. After learning methods to control rice borers, more than 300 people in the village went to the fields to catch borers, forming a mass rice borer control movement, catching more than 120,000 rice borers, accounting for half of the total number of borers caught in the township. In winter, a movement to dig rice roots was launched. Because everyone understood the benefits of digging rice roots, 993 acres of fields were dug in one and a half days; and they organized to help Fangjiawei, a neighboring village, dig more than 60 acres. Therefore, Houhe Village won the honorary title of Model Village in Rice Borer Control in the Changzhou Prefecture. Shen Tiangen did not forget to learn while producing. He often practiced writing characters with tree branches by the haystack and on the ridges of the fields; Zhou Xiaohe inserted a small blackboard in the field while operating the waterwheel and listened to the newspaper while getting off the wheel. Qi Caifeng, who was in her fifties, was really crazy about learning culture, and the walls of her house were covered with characters.
    Due to continuous learning, the cultural and political level of the people in the village has been generally improved. Zhou Fahua, the principal of the farmers' spare-time school, was elected as the deputy township head by the masses. Some farmers were sent to the Changzhou Cultural and Educational Cadre School to study. After returning from their studies, some became instructors in the people's school, some participated in the county's simple normal school, and 20 people gloriously became mass teachers, and 15 people entered the farmers' spare-time middle school to study. This has greatly encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for learning. Everyone is determined: "Listen to Chairman Mao, be a good student, follow the Communist Party, and build a new China!"

    太湖边上的文化村
    闵海林  周铁珊
    厚和村是苏南宜兴城东区的一个小村子。在国民党反动统治时期，这个村子只有一所单级小学，二十六七个学生（他们大多数是地主阶级的子弟）。村上文盲与半文盲占百分之八十以上。解放后，村里发生了严重的灾荒，人民政府提出“战胜灾荒，就是战胜敌人”的口号，发动群众克服了困难，度过了灾荒。人民政府又进一步发动群众，用革命办法创办了农民业余学校。没有桌凳，大家砌石礅来代替；没有经费买灯油，大家便自动拿出油来。在不断克服困难的情况下，逐步展开了学习文化的热潮。
    现在，村子的面貌完全改变了，它已成了一个文化村。你一踏进村里，就会感觉到一种新鲜的空气。农会会址的墙上，到处贴着墙头诗，宣传漫画。在大路口、河埠头，分布着一百三十块流动识字牌和四块流动小黑板，上面写着有关生产运动的字；大树上、菜蔬旁、房子上，都给写上字，标明了物件名称，使人一看就晓得那是什么字。
    学习文化已成为全村人民的普遍要求，他们说：“没有文化，就当不好家。”村长周孝来说：“过去，地主迫得我一家六口没吃没穿，冬天钻在稻草里过夜，现在我光荣地当上了村长，不学文化，怎能更好地为人民服务。”现在全村已有二百七十六人（青壮年占百分之九十八）参加学习，其中有五十六对夫妻同学。全村一百五十五户中，就有七十一户全家入学。原来不识字的农民，现在都能认识八百多字。沈天根原先一字不识，现在已经能认识二千五百个字了。
    学习已成为大家的共同习惯了。他们都说：“上课好比吃饭，一天不上课，一天不得过。”一到晚上，村内四处洋溢着嘹亮的歌声。民校的学员们，唱着歌，成群结队地到业余学校去。他们把从民校学得的文化，应用在日常生活里。“家家黑板报，处处识字牌”，他们在墙上用青煤水胶刷成小黑板，经常在上面练习写字。学员朱凤娥说：“粉上小黑板，真便当，字写错了，不用橡皮擦。”
    全县民校举行政治测验时，厚和村民校全校总平均分数列在甲等，妇女班的成绩在九十分以上。过去他们常说：“种田人学文化比驴子学狮吼还要困难。”现在种田人身上也挂起了钢笔，平日掮着锄头下田，放下锄头就学文化，好像小学生一样。村里又利用庙宇开辟了阅览室，用木板做成了三十二块温习字的木牌，并添了几块黑板报。最使大家喜欢的是收音机，每到节日，厚和村农民围在一起听取广播报告。他们说：“我们还能听到毛主席的讲话哩！”阅览室里经常的读物，有“文化学习”、“工农画报”、“华东农民”、“苏南大众”和“苏南日报”等报刊。连环画有四百多册。每当雨天或农闲时节，阅览室里经常挤满了观众。
    每年春节，农民剧团都通过演出，向群众进行宣传。全村有百分之八十以上的学员参加了这个剧团，许多从不出门的妇女，经过学习，不但有了文化，也能演剧了。有的说：“到底要念书，不念书什么道理都不懂，连讲几句话也要面红耳赤呢！”通过剧团的宣传教育，使全村人民打破了迷信，现在村里已没有一家烧锡箔的了；婚姻法的宣传也教育了群众，使他们懂得了新婚姻的好处。受到旧婚姻压迫的吴芬娣、孙裕根都得到了解放，五个青年男女也找了心爱的对象。
    厚和村农民的文化学习，是和生产任务密切结合着的。一进村子，就看见沿河的墙上，写着一百多首墙头诗，还有十三幅宣传漫画，这些诗和画对于动员大家生产。起了不小的作用。大路上、河埠头，到处插着活动的识字牌和小黑板，上面写的都和生产有关。文化活动和生产活动的密切结合，大大提高了农民的生产热情。一千七百五十一土方工程在三天半内便完成了，创造了全区开河工作效率的最高纪录。
    “生产不忘学习，学习为了生产”，这是全村居民的共同口号，他们做到了学习生产两不误。在学习治螟方法以后，全村有三百多人下田捕螟，形成群众性的治螟运动，捕螟达十二万多，占全乡捕螟总数的一半。冬季则开展挖稻根运动，由于大家懂得了挖稻根的好处，一天半就挖完了九百九十三亩田；并组织起来帮助邻村方家圩挖了六十多亩。因此，厚和村得到了常州专区治螟模范村的光荣称号。沈天根生产不忘学习，他经常在草堆边、田埂上用树枝练习写字；周孝和在车水时把小黑板插在田里，下车听读报。五十几岁的祁彩凤，学习文化真像发了狂，屋里墙上全都写满了字。
    由于不断地学习，全村人民的文化、政治水平普遍提高了。农民业余学校校长周法华被群众选为副乡长。有的农民被派到常州文教干部学校去学习，学习回来以后有的当了民校辅导员，有的参加了县简易师范学习，有二十人光荣地当上了群众教师，十五人进了农民业余中学学习。这更大大地鼓舞了大家的学习热情。每个人都下定决心：“听毛主席的话，当个好学生，跟着共产党走，建设新中国！”
