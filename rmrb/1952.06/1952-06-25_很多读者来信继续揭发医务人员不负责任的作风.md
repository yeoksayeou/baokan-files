Following the publication of a reader's letter summary titled "Serious Irresponsible Practices Among Medical Staff Must Be Overcome" in this newspaper's "Reader's Letters Page" on June 18, many readers have continued to write to this newspaper, exposing the irresponsible practices of medical workers, and demanding that relevant leading bodies promptly lead medical workers to carry out ideological remoulding.

Many readers pointed out in their letters that some medical personnel are unconcerned about patients, even disgusted by them. Reader Zhou Xiufeng wrote: On May 26, he went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for surgery. After the operation, he was sent to the room where he changed clothes before the surgery. At the time, he was dizzy and nauseous and wanted to rest in the room. Some nurses disliked him, and one nurse said to him more than once, "Why aren't you leaving?" He wanted to vomit, but no one cared about him, and he ended up vomiting on the floor. The nurse then scolded him, "Didn't I tell you not to drink water? Now you've vomited all over the floor." In fact, he had not drunk any water. He couldn't stand this treatment, and although he felt very uncomfortable, he didn't want to rest anymore. He wanted to ask a comrade in the hospital to hire a car for him, but this was also refused. Readers Zhang Zhibi and eight others jointly wrote that a female comrade in their organization was injured in a car accident on the evening of June 2, losing two front teeth and bleeding profusely from the mouth. They sent her to Daoji Hospital for treatment. It was already late at night, and the wind was very strong. The patient's internal injuries were unclear, so they requested the hospital to admit the patient. The hospital claimed that there were no beds available. They negotiated repeatedly, explaining that they only needed a bed for one night and would transfer to another hospital for treatment in the morning. At this point, the hospital admitted that there were beds available, but demanded a deposit of 500,000 yuan first, otherwise they would resolutely refuse admission. After repeated pleas, the hospital finally admitted the patient, but refused to treat her. The patient asked the hospital to stop the bleeding, but the hospital said, "You're being discharged tomorrow anyway, just sleep tonight!" The patient asked a nurse for a bedpan because she needed to relieve herself. The nurse said, "I'm about to get off work. Wait for the next shift to come before asking!" The patient returned to the organization's hospital the next day and finally received a hemostatic injection, stopping the bleeding in her mouth; however, her health had been affected due to excessive blood loss.

Readers Fan Yu and four others jointly wrote to expose the extremely bad phenomenon of Beijing Municipal Third Hospital handling matters based on personal connections. Fan Yu had registered for admission to the Department of Otolaryngology at the Third Hospital since the end of last year, but had been unable to be admitted. Later, someone told him that as long as he went to Xu Yinxiang's clinic in Beichizi for treatment, he would be able to enter the Third Hospital quickly. He went to Xu Yinxiang's clinic on June 1, and Dr. Xu told him to go to the Third Hospital on the 13th. In this way, he was admitted. Dr. Xu is a contracted doctor at the Third Hospital. In addition to paying a handling fee to the hospital, patients he introduces for admission also have to pay him a handling fee. Among the three patients in the same room as Fan Yu, two were introduced by Dr. Xu.

Many medical personnel lack the spirit of self-criticism and do not accept opinions from patients. Liu Ye, the labor protection committee member of the Xinhua Printing Factory branch in Beijing, wrote: On June 16, he went to the Welfare Hospital to visit Gong Dezi, an employee of the factory who was ill. At the time, the doctor was injecting glucose into the patient. The patient felt pain and was sweating all over, so he asked if there was a problem with the injection. The doctor sternly reprimanded the patient, saying that he was pretending to be in pain and insulting the doctor. The patient was forced to make a "self-criticism." Liu Ye felt that the doctor's attitude was very bad and expressed his opinion. The doctor immediately angrily asked him what his relationship was with the patient and warned the patient not to let him visit again in the future. Reader Fan Yu wrote in his letter: On the evening of June 14, he had a severe headache and asked the nurse at the Municipal Third Hospital to find the doctor on duty. The doctor on duty had gone out earlier and was busy talking to the nurse after returning. Fan Yu's roommate asked twice before finally finding the doctor. Fan Yu asked the doctor why it took so long to come. The doctor lectured him, saying that he shouldn't make a fuss. Fan Yu said, "I am making a suggestion to you." The doctor actually said, "If you have any suggestions, take them to the president. It's not good for you to not cooperate with the doctor!"

The readers all believe that it is very necessary to launch an in-depth ideological remoulding movement among medical workers. They unanimously hope that the medical leadership organs will quickly initiate and lead this movement, so that all medical workers will establish a concept of serving the people and a good work style, and do a better job in the medical and health work of New China.

### 很多读者来信继续揭发医务人员不负责任的作风

专栏：读者来信综述

    很多读者来信继续揭发医务人员不负责任的作风
    六月十八日本报“读者来信专页”发表了题为“医务工作人员中严重的不负责任的作风必须克服”的读者来信综述后，很多读者继续给本报写信，揭发医务工作者不负责任的作风，并要求有关领导机关，迅速领导医务工作者进行思想改造。
    不少读者来信指出，某些医务人员对病人是不关心的，甚至是厌恶的。读者周秀凤来信说：他在五月二十六日到中国协和医院动手术。动完手术后，他被送到开刀前换衣服的房间里去。当时他头晕欲吐，想在房间里休息一下。有些护士讨厌他，有一个护士不止一次地对他说：“你还不出去？”他要呕吐，没有人管他，结果吐在地上了。护士就责骂他：“告诉你不要喝水，现在吐了一地。”实际上他并没有喝水。他受不了这种气，虽然身体很不舒服，也不愿意再休息了。他想请医院里的同志代他雇一辆车，也遭到拒绝。读者张之弼等九人联名来信说：他们机关里一个女同志在六月二日晚上因翻车受伤，两个门牙跌落，口腔流血不止。他们把她送入道济医院治疗。当时已是深夜，风非常大，病人内部伤情不明，他们就要求院方让病人住院。院方推说没有床位。他们再三交涉，说明只住一晚，天亮就转院治疗。这时院方承认有床位了，但要先交五十万押金，否则坚决不收。经他们再三恳求，院方才把病人收下，但竟不予治疗。病人要求院方替她止血，院方说：“反正你明天就出院，今晚睡觉吧！”病人要解手，向一个护士要便盆。护士说：“我快要下班了。你等换班的来了再要吧！”病人第二天回到机关医院，才打了止血针，止住口腔流血；但已因流血过多，影响了健康。
    读者范雨等五人联名来信揭发北京市立第三医院凭私人关系办事的极为恶劣的现象。范雨从去年年底就向第三医院耳鼻喉科登记住院，但一直不能入院。后来有人告诉他，只要到北池子徐荫祥诊疗所去治疗一下，就能很快进入第三医院。他在六月一日去徐荫祥诊疗所，徐大夫叫他十三日去第三医院。这样，他就入院了。徐大夫是第三医院的特约医师。他介绍入院的病人，除了交手续费给医院外，还得交一份手续费给他。和范雨同室的三个病人中，就有两个是徐大夫介绍进来的。
    有不少医务人员十分缺乏自我批评的精神，他们对病人提出的意见毫不接受。北京新华印刷厂分厂劳保委员刘叶来信说：他在六月十六日到福利医院去探望该厂患病的职员龚德滋。当时医生正为病人注射葡萄糖。病人感到疼痛，浑身流汗，就问是否是打针发生了问题。医生就声色俱厉地训斥病人，说他装痛，说他污辱了医生。病人只得被迫作“检讨”。刘叶觉得这个医生态度很坏，就提出了意见。医生立刻怒冲冲地问他和病人是什么关系，并警告病人以后不许让他再来探病。读者范雨在来信中说：六月十四日晚上，他头痛得很厉害，请市立第三医院护士找值班大夫。值班大夫先前出去了，回来后又忙着和护士谈话。范雨的同房病友找了两次，才把医生找来。范雨就问医生为何这么久才来。医生教训了他一顿，说他不该闹。范雨说：“我是向你提意见。”这个医生竟说：“有意见向院长提去。你跟大夫不合作，对你没有好处！”
    读者都认为在医务工作者中展开一个深入的思想改造运动是十分必要的。他们一致希望医务领导机关迅速发起并领导这一运动，使一切医务工作者树立为人民服务的观点和良好的工作作风，把新中国的医药卫生工作做得更好。
