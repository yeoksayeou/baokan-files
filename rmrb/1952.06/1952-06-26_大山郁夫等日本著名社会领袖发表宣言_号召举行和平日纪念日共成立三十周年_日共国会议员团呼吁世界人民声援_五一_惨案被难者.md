Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 25th: According to TASS, Tokyo, June 24th: "Akahata" reports: Nine prominent Japanese social leaders including Ikuo Oyama, Yoshitaro Hirano, Karoku Hosokawa, Adachi Umeichi, Chairman of the Socialist Party Reconstruction Faction, Tatsuji Fuse, Lawyer, Yuichi Horie, Head of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association, Kawarazaki, President of "Advance Theatre", poet Fukao, and artist Masamune have issued a declaration calling for Peace Day to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, and to this end, a committee composed of representatives of all forces in Japan fighting for peace will be established. The declaration emphasizes that the Communist Party has been fighting against imperialist wars for many years, and is now fearlessly leading the struggle for peace.
    The preparatory committee for celebrating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party suggests holding Peace Day on July 13th in Musashino (suburb of Tokyo).
Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Late news from Tokyo: On May 24th, the delegation of Japanese Communist Party members of the Diet issued an open letter to the world regarding the bloody suppression of Japanese workers in Tokyo People's Square on May Day, calling on the people of the world to support the Japanese people who have been brutally persecuted. The statement said: In the May Day tragedy, ten people died, and the bodies of eight of them are still missing; thousands of men and women were seriously or slightly injured due to police violence. Fearing that this incident would arouse the patriotic sentiments of the Japanese people, the Japanese government used this incident to fabricate a "riot" case. To this day, without any real evidence, they have arbitrarily arrested more than 900 progressive workers, students, and ordinary people.
    The statement emphasized: The Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class, have more clearly recognized the true colors of the American and Japanese reactionaries through their practical experience in People's Square. They are now more closely united than ever before to fight for the withdrawal of foreign troops and the defense of world peace.
    The statement earnestly said: For this incident, we appeal to all peace-loving people in the world for international assistance: (1) Provide all possible relief to the victims of May Day; (2) Send letters or telegrams demanding the release of all those arrested; (3) Protest to the American and Japanese authorities; (4) If possible, send a investigation team to investigate this incident.
    We are confident that any of the above actions you take will greatly encourage the Japanese people, who are fighting with unyielding will and tireless spirit under the tyrannical rule of American and Japanese imperialists, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism, striving for peace and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The Japanese people have scheduled June 26th for a public funeral for Masao Takahashi and Kyoshi Kondo, who died in the May Day International Labor Day and May 30th patriotic movement. On the 23rd, the Chinese People's Relief Association sent a telegram to the Japan National Relief Association, mourning the martyrs who bravely sacrificed for Japan's peace, freedom, and independence. The telegram said: "On the occasion of the public funeral for the victims of May 1st and May 30th, the Chinese people express their deep condolences to the martyrs who fought for Japan's peace, freedom, and independence; and express their boundless anger at those murderers and murderers. The Chinese people will always support the Japanese people's just struggle against persecution and against aggression."

    日共国会议员团呼吁世界人民声援“五一”惨案被难者
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社东京二十四日讯：“赤旗报”报道：大山郁夫、平野义太郎、细川嘉六、社会党再建派主席足立梅市、律师布施辰治、日苏亲善协会负责人堀江邑一、“前进剧社”社长河原崎、诗人深尾和艺术家正宗等九个日本著名社会领袖发表宣言，号召举行和平日以纪念日本共产党成立三十周年，并为此目的成立一个委员会，由日本为和平而斗争的一切力量的代表组成之。宣言着重指出，共产党多年来一直在为反对帝国主义战争而斗争，现在正奋不顾身地领导着争取和平的斗争。
    庆祝共产党成立三十周年的筹备委员会建议于七月十三日在武藏野（东京郊区）举行和平日。 【新华社二十四日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党国会议员团在五月二十四日发表关于“五一”节东京人民广场镇压日本工人的流血事件的告世界书，向世界人民呼吁声援被残暴迫害的日本人民。声明说：在“五一”惨案中，死者十人，其中八人的尸首仍无下落；因警察使用暴力而受重伤或轻伤的男女有千人之多。由于害怕这次事件引起日本人民爱国情绪的高涨，日本政府竟然利用这一事件假造了一个“暴动”的案件，到今天为止，没有任何真凭实据他们就随便逮捕了九百余名进步工人、学生与普通老百姓。
    声明强调说：日本人民，尤其是日本的工人阶级，经过人民广场上的实际体验，已经更清楚地认识了美国与日本反动派的原形。他们现在比任何时候都更加紧密地团结起来，为要求撤退外国军队和保卫世界和平而战斗。
    声明恳切地说：为了这一事件，我们向世界上一切爱好和平的人民呼吁国际援助：（一）给“五一”节的被难者以各种可能的救济；（二）发信件或拍电报要求释放一切被捕者；（三）向美国和日本当局抗议；（四）如有可能，派遣调查团调查这一事件。
    我们确信，你们所采取的上述任何行动，一定会大大鼓舞日本人民，他们正在美国和日本帝国主义分子的暴虐统治下，高举着反对帝国主义、争取和平与独立的旗帜，以不屈不挠的意志与不倦的精神进行战斗。
        【新华社二十四日讯】日本人民订于六月二十六日为在“五一”国际劳动节及“五·三○”爱国运动中牺牲的高桥正夫和近藤巨史等人举行公葬。中国人民救济总会在二十三日特致电日本国民救援会，悼唁那些为日本的和平、自由与独立而英勇牺牲的烈士们。电文中说：“值此公葬‘五一’及‘五·三○’死难者之际，中国人民对为争取日本和平、自由与独立的烈士们，表示沉痛的哀悼；对那些谋杀者和凶手，表示无限的愤怒。中国人民将永远支持日本人民反对迫害、反对侵略的正义斗争。”
