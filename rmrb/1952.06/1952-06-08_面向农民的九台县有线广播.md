	Jiutai County Wired Broadcasts for Farmers
	The Propaganda Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
	The Jiutai County wired broadcasting station in Jilin was established last December. From the beginning, the Jiutai County Party Committee attached importance to this work, proposing that the broadcasting station's reach should extend from the city to the vast number of farmers in districts and villages, and that broadcast propaganda should be farmer-oriented, directly promoting agricultural production. After more than three months of preparation, broadcasting officially began on April 1 this year.

	The broadcasting station is located in the Chengguan District, with a total broadcast line length of approximately 2,100 li. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 330 small loudspeakers have been installed, of which 250 are distributed in various districts and villages, installed in district and village people's governments, mutual aid groups, cooperatives, schools, and cultural stations; the loudspeakers in the urban area are installed in factories, government offices, schools, department stores, and at intersections. The urban area broadcast loudspeakers have dedicated lines, while the district and village broadcast loudspeakers borrow the telephone lines that connect to the districts and villages. There are two broadcasts each day, each lasting one and a half to two hours. Currently, the midday broadcast is for the urban area, mainly rebroadcasting programs from Jilin and Changchun radio stations, and introducing factory production experiences and the study situation of government cadres. The evening broadcast is for the rural areas (during the broadcast time, telephone lines in various districts and villages are temporarily suspended), mainly broadcasting materials from the county, such as the progress of agricultural production in each district and village, the conditions for the mutual aid groups' bumper harvest competition challenges and responses, agricultural production experiences, criticisms, commendations, notices, and instructions. In addition, there are newspaper readings and speeches, such as inviting leading comrades and labor models to the broadcasting station to give reports and speeches. Through broadcasting, the policies, laws, and calls of the Party and the People's Government are conveyed to the masses, and local, specific examples are used to inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production and patriotism, promote the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement, and enrich rural cultural life with appropriate literary and artistic programs. The broadcast materials are all provided by districts and villages, and are all true and familiar stories from the local area, so the effect is relatively large. In early May this year, the county organized a broadcasting committee to specifically lead the work of the broadcasting station. The district established listening stations, and the village has listening groups, responsible for organizing the masses to listen on time and reflecting the masses' listening situation, and providing manuscripts to the broadcasting station at any time. It is closely integrated with the Party's propaganda network. The radio network is one of the important propaganda tools, and also an important part of the construction of the propaganda network. It can directly speak to the masses every day, and also provide speaking materials to the Party's propagandists in a timely manner. The county also plans to organize county-level reporters to report, and provide district-level reporters with materials to impart. After the propagandists have mastered this powerful tool, they can receive propaganda materials at any time and carry out repeated propaganda to the masses. Therefore, the broadcasting committee requires that each loudspeaker have a propagandist responsible for its management, and that he serve as the head of the listening group.

	The broadcasting station conducted current affairs and policy education for the peasant masses and promoted the patriotic bumper harvest competition movement. For example, when the "Conference to Protest the Crimes of American Aggressors Spreading Bacteria" was held, the live broadcast of the conference was relayed to all districts and villages in the county, with approximately 120,000 to 130,000 listeners. It aroused the masses' incomparable hatred for the American aggressors and launched an epidemic prevention and hygiene campaign. The broadcast of the masses' production situation greatly stimulated the masses' production enthusiasm. When the masses in Shuangmiaozicun village heard about the production situation in other villages, they asked the district cadres working in the village, "Why isn't there our village's experience? We have also completed the grain purchase work very well." This stimulated the enthusiasm of the cadres working in the countryside to write articles. The Heixiuwen Mutual Aid Group in Shangwowopu Village, Chaoyang District, was only organized this year. At the beginning of spring plowing, some members had the idea of "not rushing." Later, when they heard on the radio that a certain mutual aid group in another village had finished planting sorghum, they realized that they were lagging behind; therefore, all six plows in the group, along with people and horses, went to the field together, and in two days, they finished planting all the more than seven qing of sorghum land; and they made a plan to guarantee the completion of planting the large fields within a week, and strive to be "the first to be on the radio." Group leader Heixiuwen said, "The radio is really good. Before knowing the situation of other villages, we thought we were planting quite fast. Who knew we were behind them." From then on, everyone in the Heixiuwen Mutual Aid Group listened to the radio every day. If most people didn't have time to listen, they would elect a representative to listen and then convey the information back. For example, after the broadcast of the bumper harvest plan of the Heixiuwen Mutual Aid Group in Xinglong Village, Chaoyang District, Sun Xifen, the women's group leader of the mutual aid group, actively led the whole group to formulate a bumper harvest plan that night, and the next morning, she sent someone to the deputy secretary of the county party committee, hoping to be broadcasted. Before the plan was formulated, the women in this mutual aid group were not prepared to participate in spring plowing. But after the plan was formulated, the women went to the fields, including two who drove the harrows and two who held the "lazi" (pulling ropes), saving four male laborers to filter manure, and adding a harrow (agricultural tool for plowing the land); the harrowing work was completed two days earlier than other groups; in addition, all the manure accumulated this year was sent to the fields, and one more manure application was made. After the patriotic bumper harvest movement was launched, mutual aid groups throughout the county challenged and responded to each other through the radio. The broadcasting station received three or four bumper harvest plans and challenge and response conditions from mutual aid groups in various districts and villages every day. The members of the mutual aid groups encouraged each other, saying, "We've said it, the whole county has heard it, people are watching us, we have to do what we say!"

	Broadcasting is also a powerful weapon for carrying out criticism and self-criticism. In April, a certain disaster area in Jiutai County lacked grain stalks for feeding livestock, and the higher authorities designated the Chaoyang District Cooperative to purchase them. However, the cadres of the cooperative lacked understanding of this work and did not conduct in-depth investigations and research among the masses, and thought to themselves that "it is difficult to buy"; they did not buy even a catty within fifteen days, resulting in losses for the livestock in the disaster area (the grain stalks in the area were flooded, and the cattle could not digest them and two died). When the correspondent discovered these situations, he wrote a critical article and submitted it to the broadcasting station for broadcasting. After hearing this news, the peasants in Chaoyang District pointed out that the bureaucratism of the District Cooperative was serious, and they said, "We have grain stalks, we used to sell them for eighty yuan a catty a few days ago, this time we'll give them for one hundred and ten yuan a catty, why wouldn't we sell them!" The next day, the cadres of the District Cooperative went down, and in just one village, they bought 30,000 catties in five or six days. Then the correspondent wrote another commendatory article. After hearing that their district had received praise, the masses were even more motivated. They said, "This broadcast is really good. If there are shortcomings, it criticizes them, and if there are achievements, it praises them. In the future, don't fall behind in everything, and strive to be on the radio more often and receive more praise."

	After the broadcast penetrated into the districts and villages, it not only inspired the peasants' production enthusiasm and promoted production, but also changed the phenomenon of lacking cultural life in the countryside. Peasants not only organized newspaper reading groups to read newspapers and attended peasant schools to study, but also listened to the radio every evening. Every evening after dinner, men, women, old and young, would call out to each other and flock to the loudspeakers to listen to music, songs, and the production situation in various places; inside and outside the houses, on and under the kangs (heated platforms), and on the window sills, were all crowded with people. Some individual households even requested to install a loudspeaker. As for the expenses for installing the loudspeaker, the masses all said, "This is not a problem!" and voluntarily bear the cost. A little girl said to her mother, "Mom, I will also weed the fields this year, and when I earn money, we will also buy a loudspeaker and install it." Qiu Laotaitai and her daughter-in-law in Shangwowopu Village waited with their children in their arms every day after dinner. The old lady said, "I've lived for five or sixty years and haven't been anywhere. Now I know everything sitting at home." On the night when loudspeakers were installed in Taojiacun Village, Shuangmiaozicun District, Wang Laotaitai, who was over sixty years old, stood excitedly with a lamp for a full two hours until the broadcast was over. When someone asked her if she was tired, she replied, "Tired? I've never heard of this in my life. The little box can talk and sing. Listening to a few segments every night makes my heart feel so bright!"

	These vivid facts tell us that Jiutai County's approach is good, and it provides a correct direction for the development of wired broadcasting stations in various counties. Wired broadcasts in each county should extend from towns to the countryside and face the vast number of farmers. The county party committee's propaganda department should strengthen the political leadership of the broadcasting station, give play to the role of the broadcasting committee, enrich the content of the broadcast, and strengthen the broadcast's ideology. The self-broadcasted manuscripts should pay attention to locality, combine with the central work of each period, and solve the problems and ideological concerns existing in the masses' production. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of the masses' listening work. In the beginning, after the broadcast loudspeakers were set up in some districts and villages, only the call to listen was made, but there was no one in charge of organizing regular listening work, forming a laissez-faire phenomenon, and the effect of the broadcast was small. For example, in Shanzicun Village, Erdaogou District, the loudspeakers were installed in remote places, and the masses were unwilling to go to listen because it was inconvenient, so the broadcast did not play its due role.

    面向农民的九台县有线广播
    中共吉林省委宣传部
    吉林九台县有线广播站是在去年十二月建立起来的。开始，中共九台县委就重视这个工作，提出广播站的广播范围，应从城市扩大到区、村广大农民中去；广播宣传应当面向农民，直接推动农业生产。经过三个多月的筹备，在今年四月一日正式开始广播。
    广播站设在城关区，广播路线全长约计二千一百多华里。据不完全统计，共设了三百三十个小喇叭，其中有二百五十个喇叭分布在各区、村，装设在区、村人民政府、互助组、合作社、学校、文化站；城区的喇叭装设在工厂、机关、学校、百货公司和十字路口。城区广播喇叭设有专线，各区、村广播喇叭是借用通到各区、村的电话线。每天共分两次广播，每次广播时间为一小时半到两小时。现在午间一次是对城区的广播，以转播吉林、长春电台的节目为主，并介绍工厂生产经验和机关干部的学习情况。晚间一次是对农村的广播（在广播时间内，各区、村电话暂时停用），以广播本县材料为主，如各区、村农业生产进行情况、各互助组的丰产竞赛挑战应战条件、农业生产经验、批评、表扬、通知和指示等。另外有读报、讲演，如请首长和劳动模范来广播站报告和讲话。通过广播向群众贯彻党和人民政府的政策、法令和号召，用当地的具体事例，启发群众的生产积极性和爱国热情，推动爱国丰产竞赛运动，并以适当的文艺节目来活跃农村文化生活。广播的材料都是区、村供给的，都是当地的真人实事，农民都很熟悉，所以收效比较大。今年五月初，县里组织了广播委员会，具体领导广播站的工作。区成立了收听站，村有收听小组，负责组织群众按时收听和反映群众收听情况，并随时组织稿件供给广播站。它和党的宣传网密切地结合起来。收音网是重要的宣传工具之一，也是宣传网建设的重要部分，它每天可以直接地向群众讲话，也及时地向党的宣传员供给了讲话材料。县里并有计划地组织县级报告员报告，供给区级报告员以传授材料。宣传员掌握了这一有力的工具以后，可以随时收到宣传材料，向群众进行反复宣传。所以广播委员会要求每一个喇叭要有一个宣传员负责掌握，并由他担任收听组长。
    广播站向农民群众进行了时事政策教育，推动了爱国丰产竞赛运动。如召开“抗议美国侵略者撒布细菌罪行大会”时，把大会的实况转播给全县各区、村，收听者约有十二、三万人。它激发了群众对美国侵略者的无比愤恨，展开了防疫卫生运动。群众生产情况的广播，大大地刺激了群众的生产情绪。双庙子村群众听到了外村的生产情况时，他们向在该村工作的区干部问：“怎么没有咱们村的经验呢？购粮工作咱们也完成得挺好哇。”这就刺激了下乡工作干部的写稿积极性。朝阳区和尚窝堡村黑秀文互助组是今年才组织起来的，春耕开始时，某些组员有“不着忙”的思想。后来在广播里听到别的村某互助组已种完了高粱，他们才知道自己落后了；于是全组六付犁杖连人带马一齐下地，两天工夫，就把七垧多地的高粱全种完了；并且订了计划，在一星期内保证种完大田，争取“先上广播”。组长黑秀文说：“广播真好，不知别村的情况以前，咱们还觉得自己种的挺快呢，谁知道拉到人家后边了。”从此以后，黑秀文互助组的每一个人天天都要听广播，如果多数人没工夫听，就推选一个代表听完了回去传达。再如朝阳区兴隆村孙德恒互助组，在黑秀文互助组的丰产计划播出以后，互助组的妇女组长孙喜芬等，积极地领导全组在当天晚上订出了丰产计划，第二天早晨就派人把计划送到县委副书记那里去，希望能给广播。这个互助组在未订计划时，妇女没有准备参加春耕。但是在订出计划后，妇女都下地了，其中有两名赶耲耙，两名扶拉子，省出四个男劳动力来滤粪，并增加一付耲耙（犁地用的农具）；耲楂地比别的组提早两天完工；另外还把今年所积的粪都送到地里去了，多上了一次粪。爱国丰产运动开展起来以后，全县各互助组之间，就通过广播提出了挑战应战。广播站每天收到三、四份来自各区、村互助组的丰产计划和挑战应战条件。互助组的组员们，都互相勉励着：“话可说出去啦，全县都听见了，人家看着咱们，咱们可得说到做到啊！”
    广播也是开展批评与自我批评的有力武器。四月里，九台县某灾区缺乏喂牲畜的谷草，上级指定朝阳区联社去购买。但该社干部对这一工作缺乏认识，没有深入群众进行调查研究，竟自以为“不好买”；十五天内连一斤也没买上，以致灾区牲畜遭到了损失（该地的谷草被水淹过，牛吃了不能消化，死了两头）。通讯员发现了这些情况，写了一篇批评稿，交广播站广播出去。朝阳区的农民听到这个消息以后，都指出区联社的官僚主义作风严重，他们说：“咱们有谷草哇，前几天卖八十块钱一斤，这回给一百一十块一斤，咱们干啥不卖呢！”第二天，区联社的干部下去，仅在一个村，五、六天工夫就买了三万斤。接着通讯员又写了一篇表扬的稿件，群众听到本区受到了表扬，劲头更大了，他们都说：“这广播真好，有缺点就批评，有成绩就表扬，今后事事别落后，争取多上广播，多受表扬。”
    广播深入区、村以后，不但鼓舞了农民的生产热情，推动了生产，而且改变了农村缺少文化生活的现象。农民们不仅组织读报组读报，上农民学校学习，每天晚上还可以收听广播了。每天晚饭后，男女老幼都互相呼唤着，拥向喇叭跟前听音乐、歌唱和各地的生产情况；屋里屋外，炕上炕下，窗户台上，都挤满了人。还有个别的户要求安一个喇叭。至于安喇叭的经费，群众都说：“这个不成问题！”自愿负担。一个小女孩跟她妈妈说：“妈妈，今年我也薅地，赚了钱，咱们也买个喇叭安上。”和尚窝堡村秋老太太和她的儿媳妇每天吃完饭便抱着小孩去等着。老太太说：“我活了五、六十岁啦，哪也没去过，这回坐在家里什么都知道啦。”双庙子区陶家村有一个六十多岁的王老太太，在村上安喇叭的那天晚上，她兴奋地端着灯足足站了两个钟头，一直到广播完了。别人问她累不累，她回答说：“还累？一辈子也没听见过这个呀，小盒子也会说话、唱歌，天天晚上听几段，心里多敞亮！”
    这些生动的事实告诉我们，九台县的做法是好的，它给各县有线广播站提出了一个正确的发展方向。各县有线广播应该从城镇伸展到农村，面向广大农民。县委宣传部要加强广播站的政治领导，发挥广播委员会的作用，充实广播内容，加强广播的思想性。自播的稿件要注意地方性，结合每一时期的中心工作，解决群众生产中存在的问题和思想顾虑。同时要加强组织群众的收听工作。最初有的区、村广播喇叭设立后，只号召大家收听，而无专人负责组织经常的收听工作，形成自流现象，广播的效果就小了。又如二道沟区山咀子村，把喇叭安在僻远的地方，群众因不方便，不愿去听，因此广播也没有发挥它应有的作用。
