Chairman, fellow representatives:

    The Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is being held for the first time today in the people's capital, gathering representatives from industry and commerce across the country, concentrating opinions, exchanging experiences, promoting unity, discussing the political and economic tasks of industry and commerce after the "Five-Anti" movement, and carrying out the preparatory work for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. I extend warm congratulations to the meeting.

    In the past three years, under the leadership of the People's Government, industrial and commercial circles across the country have made certain contributions to subscribing to public bonds, supporting the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, actively producing, and supplying the needs of the vast domestic market after the land reform.

    The great "Five-Anti" movement, which was successfully completed not long ago, was an educational transformation movement within the united front. Based on the Common Program as the standard, it conducted education and transformation through mass criticism and self-criticism within the people, in order to better unite the industrial and commercial circles. This can be clearly understood from the People's Government's guidelines and steps in leading this movement. The national bourgeoisie has its positive and progressive side, but due to the negative side of the "five poisons" ideology and behavior, which are often difficult to remove, it is necessary to remove the "five poisons" under the education of the broad masses in order to bring into play its positive and progressive side.

    Now, the "Five-Anti" movement has basically ended in various places, and most industrialists and businessmen have been able to obtain opportunities to transform themselves and improve themselves in the movement.

    The Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is being held at this appropriate time, that is, after the victorious completion of the great "Five-Anti" movement, and on the eve of a new and healthy economic prosperity, which is of great significance. I would like to offer two points of opinion with pleasure:

    My first hope is that through the exchange of opinions among the representatives of industry and commerce across the country, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which leads the industry and commerce across the country, will be organized as soon as possible, and then the industrial and commercial federations in large, medium, and small cities across the country will be established and improved, mobilizing industrialists and businessmen across the country to actively improve management and develop production on the basis of eliminating the "five poisons," and play a due role in the economic construction and industrialization process of the new China. In order to accomplish this task, the industrial and commercial circles across the country must strictly abide by the basic principles of the Common Program, accept the leadership of the working class, unite well with the working class, and give play to their enthusiasm for production.

    This is not enough. It is also necessary to call on industrialists and businessmen across the country to unite and make progress, understand and master the Common Program through learning, vigorously carry out ideological transformation, and constantly improve themselves, so as to play a greater active role and make greater contributions in the great national construction cause that is about to come. Finally, I wish the conference a success!

    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上致词（摘要）主席团、各位代表先生们：
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，今天首次举行于人民首都，聚全国各地工商界代表于一堂，集中意见，交流经验，促进团结，讨论工商界在“五反”运动后的政治经济任务，和进行全国工商业联合会的筹备工作。我敬向会议致热烈的祝贺。
    三年来，全国各地工商界在人民政府领导之下，对认购公债、支援抗美援朝运动、积极生产、供给土地改革后广大国内市场需要等方面，都有其一定的贡献。
    在不久以前胜利完成的伟大“五反”运动，是统一战线内部的教育改造运动，依据共同纲领为准则，通过人民内部的群众批评与自我批评，进行教育改造，以便能更好地团结工商界。这从人民政府领导这一运动的方针和步骤上面，都可以得到明确的了解。民族资产阶级有其积极的进步的一面，但由于消极一面的五毒思想与行为往往附着难除，必须在广大群众教育之下，除去五毒，才能够发挥其积极的进步的一面。
    现在各地“五反”运动已基本结束，大多数的工商业者在运动中，都能得到改造自己，提高自己的机会。
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，恰当这个时候，即伟大的“五反”运动胜利完成以后，和新的康健的经济繁荣即将到来前夕举行，是具有重大意义的。我谨以愉快心情提供两点意见：
    我的第一个希望是：通过这一全国工商界代表的交换意见，使领导全国工商界的全国工商业联合会筹备委员会早日组织起来，并进而建立与健全全国各大、中、小城市的工商业联合会组织，动员全国工商业者，在肃清五毒的基础之上，积极改善经营，发展生产，在新中国经济建设和工业化的进程中起应有的作用。为了完成这一任务，须使全国工商界严格遵守共同纲领的基本原则，接受工人阶级的领导，与工人阶级好好团结起来，发挥生产积极性。
    仅此还不够，还要号召全国工商业者团结进步，从学习中领会和掌握共同纲领，大力进行思想改造，不断地提高自己，在即将到来的伟大的国家建设事业中，发挥更大的积极作用，和更大的贡献。末了，预祝大会的成功！
