Restraining the Trend of Blindly Expanding Cotton Fields and Turning to Increasing Cotton Yield per Unit Area
Hubei Province is one of the most important cotton-producing areas in the country. Since liberation in 1949, the cotton acreage in Hubei has expanded rapidly, and cotton production has increased significantly. By 1951, the cotton acreage had exceeded the pre-war level by 18.6%, and the total lint cotton production had recovered to 99.76% of the pre-war level. However, in many areas, there was a trend of excessively expanding cotton fields. In 1951, Xishui County converted more than 20,000 mu of paddy fields into cotton fields. Some areas planted cotton on mountains, and some planted cotton in low-lying lake fields. In the Xiangyang Special District, many places planted cotton on land unsuitable for cotton cultivation, resulting in only a few kilograms of lint cotton per mu, which was not enough to cover the production costs. On the other hand, the yield per unit area of cotton fields was still very low. In 1951, the average lint cotton yield per mu in the province was only 26.5 jin, which was far from the pre-war level (31.6 jin). In order to prevent the blind expansion of cotton fields, the Hubei Provincial People's Government issued two instructions to various counties this year to check the cotton planting situation. Each special district and county, through people's representative conferences, farmer representative conferences, and labor model conferences, publicized the policy of "increasing the production of cotton, hemp, tobacco, and sugarcane, but not reducing grain fields," emphasizing the increase of yield per unit area. According to the current situation, except for Jingzhou Special District, where the sown area is about 2% higher than last year, and Guanghua County in Xiangyang Special District, which has increased slightly compared to last year, the cotton farmers in various places are planting cotton fields in accordance with the government's requirements. The province's cotton planting area this year is about 5% less than in 1951, but the total lint cotton production is expected to increase by 13%. This year, cotton farmers generally implemented the selection of superior varieties, intensive cultivation, application of more fertilizer, and improved cultivation techniques in order to increase the yield per unit area of cotton.

Promoting Superior Varieties, Improving Cultivation Methods, and the Masses Begin to Master Science and Technology
Gradually reducing and eliminating the mixed degradation of cotton seeds in various places is an important link in increasing the yield per unit area of cotton. Since 1950, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has systematically promoted superior varieties such as Dezi cotton, Kezi cotton, and Daizi cotton in various cotton-producing areas. In the cotton-wheat double cropping and autumn rainy cotton-producing areas of Hubei, it is difficult to promote improved cotton with a longer growing period. In 1951, Xinzhou County (Central Cotton Area) focused on promoting Daizi cotton in Zhu Hong Village. Initially, the masses had many concerns and were unwilling to plant it, fearing that it would "not adapt to the soil and water" and "failure to harvest would delay the year's harvest." After repeated publicity, the masses said, "Let's plant a little to try!" Liu Wenhai, a local farmer, recalled his experience of planting Daizi cotton last year: "Last year, I got more than two jin of Daizi cotton seeds. I didn't know which field to plant them in. I wasn't sure about planting this cotton, so I was afraid of wasting the land if I planted it in good land, so I planted it casually in the broad bean field. After the cotton was sown, I didn't dare to invest more money and effort. The government lent me 40 jin of soybean cake and asked me to apply it to the Daizi cotton field; I didn't want to, so I applied the cake fertilizer to the Central Cotton field. Weeding was also done first in the Central Cotton field. When weeding the first time, the seedlings of Daizi cotton were not as good-looking as the seedlings of Central Cotton. I thought: These flowers are 'lost.' Soon, the seedlings of Daizi cotton also grew strong, and I was happy in my heart. Later, the leaves of Daizi cotton grew as big as fans. I had never seen cotton with such large leaves before. At this time, I was afraid that it would not bear peaches. Later, I listened to the comrades and practiced pruning and leaf removal. Who knew that Daizi cotton flowered and bore peaches very well, and I felt relieved. The peaches of Daizi cotton are very big. I thought: This big fleshy peach grows upwards, how can it burst open! I was afraid it would still be 'lost.' In the end, the cotton was not 'lost,' but my conservative thinking was 'lost.' Although I took care of it so carelessly, the harvest of Daizi cotton was still 20-30% better than that of Central Cotton. One plant had 84 peaches on it, it was so lovely! Looking at this flower, everyone wants to plant it." Through various forms such as "Cotton Farmer Representative Meetings," "Old Farmer Forums," "Cotton Planting Seminars," and "Improved Cotton Field Exhibitions," "using real people to tell real stories, using objects to show real situations," cotton farmers accepted improved cotton and learned advanced high-yield experiences. After visiting the Daizi cotton field exhibition in Zhu Hong Village, Xinzhou, many farmers automatically bought back the Daizi cotton with more than 100 peaches to promote it to everyone. Farmers began to demand improved cotton seeds. The area of improved cotton has been expanding year by year. In 1950, the area of improved cotton only accounted for 3.78% of the total cotton area, but this year it has reached 26%. This is one of the important conditions for ensuring the increase in cotton production this year.

With the expansion of the area of improved cotton, attention must be paid to maintaining the quality of improved seeds. In 1951, the Jingzhou Special Office of Agriculture and Forestry implemented the "Pure Variety Maintenance through Flower Harvesting" method, fully relying on the masses to carry out ginning and seed preservation work. This method is that the production team organized by cotton farmers in each township (village) handles the processing of improved cotton within the team and sells the ginned lint cotton and cotton seeds to the ginning mill directly led by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry. The lint cotton is resold to the textile company by the ginning mill, and the cotton seeds are the responsibility of the cotton farmers who sell the flowers to keep and select, waiting for the government to organize the allocation of seeds. At the same time, a higher price is implemented for high-quality cotton, and a bonus is added to the high-quality cotton seed; and the ginning machine donation tax is exempted, reducing the ginning cost, and encouraging cotton farmers to sell seed cotton. Cotton farmers generally supervise each other, collectively guarantee that they will not sell privately, not mix, carefully select seeds, and properly preserve them.

In Hubei Province, there are very few cotton fields that are idle in winter, and most of them are planted with both cotton and wheat. Generally, cotton farmers sow wheat by broadcasting, so cotton is also sown by broadcasting in wheat fields. This greatly hinders emergence, seedling protection, and weeding, directly affecting yield. In the past two years, the method of strip sowing wheat in improved cotton areas, and then dibbling cotton in wheat rows, has achieved great success. We are further promoting the method of strip sowing cotton on this basis. Cotton farmers have gradually realized that dibbling and strip sowing are much better than broadcasting. Most of the cotton fields in Jiangling County have been changed to strip sowing and dibbling this year. Farmer Liu Xianxue said:
"Strip sowing is much better than broadcasting, and better than dibbling. It not only saves a lot of seeds, but also makes it easy to keep seedlings, set seedlings, and transplant. It can ensure full seedlings, and weeding, fertilization, pest control, and picking cotton are also convenient and labor-saving. The government's research is not wrong!" However, many cotton farmers still believe that "strip sowing wheat will reduce yield" and that "dibbling and strip sowing are not as reliable as broadcasting for emergence." Therefore, we must continue to use various methods to educate cotton farmers to ensure that advanced cultivation techniques can be implemented among the masses.

Cotton farmers have many good cotton planting habits, and farmers also have rich wisdom, creating many practical and feasible cultivation techniques and cotton planting tools. Cotton farmers in Xinzhou County are good at transplanting. Sun Shaoqing, a model cotton grower, is a transplanting expert. The survival rate of his transplants often reaches 100%, ensuring full seedlings, which also ensures a good harvest, breaking the conservative saying that "a dead mother cannot be revived, and a flower cannot be transplanted alive." "Cotton hoeing seven times is as white as silver" "Water can be generated under the hoe (more hoeing can prevent drought)," etc., have become the common experience of cotton farmers. Wen Yukun, a cotton farmer in Mitosi, Jiangling County, created a five-tooth cultivator, which can cultivate and weed 16 to 20 mu per day for two people, which is very popular among nearby farmers. In terms of pest prevention and control, farmers also have many effective local methods. As long as we pay attention to these good cotton planting habits and rich wisdom of farmers, and further improve and promote them, cotton production can be gradually increased.

Several Problems That Need to be Solved Urgently
First, timely transplanting and replanting to ensure full seedlings. This year, cotton sowing started earlier in various places, and sowing began in early April. However, due to the influence of spring rain, the sowing period was very long, and there were still a few cotton fields that had not been sown until mid-May. Most cotton seedlings are growing vigorously, and some have uneven emergence due to rain after sowing. The areas with the most serious seedling loss reached more than 50%. Various places have seized the time to replant. There are still a few cotton fields with missing seedlings, but because replanting is late, we should seize the opportunity to lead cotton farmers to transplant seedlings and replant, and widely introduce the experience of transplanting and replanting to ensure full seedlings.

Second, pay attention to drought and flood prevention. The terrain in the Hubei cotton area is complex. The hills are afraid of drought, the lake areas are afraid of waterlogging, and the riverside areas are afraid of floods. This year, the great Jingjiang flood diversion project started, ensuring the increase in cotton production in various counties in Jingzhou Special District, one of the most important cotton-producing areas in Hubei Province. Other dry dikes, people's dikes, as well as farmland water conservancy projects such as repairing ponds, digging weirs, opening canals, and repairing ditches, have also achieved great achievements. However, there was a lot of rain this spring, and cotton fields in the lake area still need to pay attention to opening ditches for drainage to ensure that cotton seedlings are not waterlogged. The flood season is approaching, and flood prevention work must be strengthened to ensure that the dikes do not break. The leading agencies in the hilly cotton area should organize the masses to water and prevent drought at any time to ensure a good cotton harvest.

Third, solve the problem of widespread fertilizer shortage. Last winter and this spring, Hubei was busy with land reform and dike repair, etc., and failed to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. Many farmers pay attention to fertilizing paddy fields and neglect fertilizing dry land. The existing fertilizer has been concentrated for use in paddy fields, and cotton fields generally lack fertilizer. Tenant farmers and poor farmers who have just been allocated land in the land reform have more difficulty with fertilizer and have no cash to buy it. Various places should seize the time to accumulate a batch of fertilizer. At present, 20 million jin of chemical fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) in the province has been distributed to various regions, but because the masses do not have the habit of using this fertilizer, are afraid of burning crops, and think the price is high, it has not been fully loaned out. It is necessary to widely and deeply publicize the application method of ammonium sulfate to dispel the ideological concerns of cotton farmers.
In high-yield cotton fields, nitrogen fertilizer is applied more, while phosphorus fertilizer is very little, and if the combination is not appropriate, crazy growth may occur. Where possible, rice bran, fish fertilizer, chicken and duck manure should be added, attention should be paid to drainage and irrigation, and appropriate pruning and topping should be carried out to prevent crazy growth and delayed maturity.

Fourth, vigorously prevent and control diseases and insect pests. The climate in Hubei is warm and humid, and there are particularly many cotton diseases and insect pests; in addition, there was little snow last winter, and in some improved cotton areas, because the improved cotton was harvested too late, the fields were not plowed, and the fallen leaves and bolls were not picked clean, and not many pests died overwintering. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Aphids occurred particularly early this year, and red spiders, wireworms, seedling blight, and anthracnose have also occurred in some places. Although various places have mastered some medicines and machinery, they cannot solve all the problems. We must vigorously lead cotton farmers to carry out artificial prevention and control, and implement the policy of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment." It is necessary to universally organize pest prevention and control teams, mobilize cotton farmers to purchase tobacco stalks, and hold cotton farmer symposiums to exchange and discuss various pest prevention and control methods; we must also continue to strengthen publicity work and overcome the erroneous ideas of some cotton farmers who are afraid of trouble and simply waiting for the government to lend out medicines and machinery.

Fifth, strengthen the leadership of high-yield priorities and strengthen technical guidance to cotton farmers. Party and government institutions in various places must strengthen the leadership of high-yield priorities, work hard to cultivate them, and check them on time; at the same time, they should organize cotton farmers, launch competitions, carry out ideological education on patriotic high-yield competitions, and promptly and comprehensively promote the experience gained.

At present, the vast majority of cotton farmers urgently require technical guidance, especially in the newly promoted improved cotton areas. Zhang Xiangshan, a farmer in Shimiao Township, Xinzhou District, Xinzhou County, because he did not understand the technique of planting Daizi cotton, only heard that digging "dangzi" was good, so he used a kitchen knife to dig up the soil, put down the cotton seeds, and put the soil back, resulting in deep and hardened "dangzi" and a very serious shortage of seedlings. At present, there are very few technical cadres in the province, and various meetings should be used in large numbers, and the enthusiasm of village cadres in leading production after land reform should be fully utilized, and experience exchange meetings and technical research meetings should be organized widely and in a timely manner. The cotton farmer symposium held in Xinzhen Township, Xinzhou County, showed that many cotton farmers mistakenly thought that Daizi cotton should be planted very sparsely, leaving only 1,400 to 1,500 seedlings per mu. After Sun Shaoqing, a model cotton grower, and others introduced their experiences, everyone agreed that cotton could be appropriately densely planted, and decided to leave about 2,000 cotton seedlings per mu. It can be seen that without strengthening technical guidance to cotton farmers and letting them drift on their own, the increase in cotton production will be greatly affected.

    改进植棉技术必须充分依靠群众
    ——湖北省推广优良棉种和先进耕作技术的成绩和经验
    周咏曾　周维敷遏止盲目扩大棉田的趋势，转向提高棉花单位面积产量
    湖北省是全国重要产棉区之一。一九四九年解放以来，湖北的棉田面积迅速扩大，棉花产量显著增加。到一九五一年，棉田面积已经超过战前水平百分之十八点六，皮棉总产量恢复到战前水平百分之九十九点七六，但是，不少地区发生了过分扩大棉田的趋势。浠水县在一九五一年约有二万多亩稻田改为棉田；有的地区在山上种棉花；有的地区在低洼湖田种棉花；襄阳专区不少地方把不宜植棉的土地种了棉花，结果每亩只收几斤皮棉，不够生产成本。另一方面，棉田单位面积产量仍然很低，一九五一年全省平均每亩皮棉产量只二十六点五斤，和战前水平（三十一点六斤）相比，还相差很远。湖北省人民政府为了防止棉田盲目扩大，今年曾两次指示各县检查棉花播种情形。各专区和县分别通过各界人民代表会、农民代表会和劳动模范大会等，宣传了“增产棉、麻、烟、甘蔗，但不减少粮田”的政策，强调提高单位面积产量。根据目前的情况看来，除荆州专区播种面积约较去年增加百分之二、襄阳专区光化县比去年略有增加外，各地棉农播种棉田情形，尚能符合政府要求。全省今年植棉面积约比一九五一年减少百分之五，而皮棉总产量却要增加百分之十三。今年棉农一般都实行了选用良种，精耕细作，多施肥料，改良耕作技术，以便提高棉花单位面积产量。
    推广优良品种，改进耕作方法，群众开始掌握科学技术
    逐渐减少和消灭各地棉种的混杂退化现象，是提高棉花单位面积产量的重要一环。从一九五○年起，湖北省农林厅就有计划地分别在各棉区推广德字棉、柯字棉、岱字棉良种。在棉麦两熟和秋季多雨的湖北棉区，推广生长期较长的改良棉是有困难的。一九五一年新洲县（中棉区）在朱衖村重点推广岱字棉，起初群众顾虑甚多，都不愿意种，怕“不服水土”，“种了不收，误了年成”。经过反复宣传，群众才说，“少种一点试试看吧！”当地农民刘文海回忆他去年种岱字棉的情形说：“我去年得了两斤多岱字棉籽，不晓得种到那块地里好。种这号棉花没有把握，种到好地里怕糟蹋了地，就马马虎虎把它种到蚕豆地里。棉花下种以后，我又不敢多下本钱和多花工夫。政府贷给我四十斤豆饼，要我下到岱字棉地里；我不愿意，就把饼肥下到中棉地里去了。薅草也是先薅中棉地里的。薅头遍草时，岱字棉的苗没有中棉的苗好看，我想：这些花算是‘丢’了。不久，岱字棉苗也长得壮了，我心里才喜欢起来。后来岱字棉的叶子长得有扇子那么大，我从来没有见过棉花有这样大的叶子，这时又怕结不了桃。后来我听工作同志的话，实行整枝、打叶。谁知岱字棉开花结桃都很好，心里才安下来了。岱字棉的桃大得很，我想：这个大肉桃，朝天长，怎么能炸开呀！怕是还要‘丢’。最后，棉花没有‘丢’，我那保守思想可‘丢’了。虽然我那样不经心照管，岱字棉收成还比中棉强两三成。有一棵上面结了八十四个桃，真是爱死人！把这花一看，那个都想种。”各地通过“棉农代表会”“老农座谈会”“植棉讲习会”“改良棉田间展览”等多种多样的形式，“以现人说现事，用实物表实情”，使棉农接受了改良棉，学到了先进的丰产经验。很多农民参观了新洲朱弄村岱字棉田间展览以后，自动把结了一百多个桃的岱字棉买回去向大家宣传。农民们开始要求得到改良棉种籽。改良棉推广面积逐年扩大。一九五○年改良棉面积只占棉田总面积百分之三点七八，今年达到了百分之二十六。这是保证今年棉花增产的重要条件之一。
    随着良棉面积的扩大，必须注意保持良种质量。荆州专署农林科一九五一年实施了“良种收花保纯”办法，充分依靠群众，进行轧花保种保纯工作。这种办法是，由各乡（村）棉农组织的生产小组，办理组内改良棉的加工业务，把轧出的皮棉和棉籽卖给农林科直接领导的轧花厂。皮棉由轧花厂转售给花纱布公司，棉籽则由售花的棉农自行负责保管拣选，等待政府组织调拨换种。同时实行优棉优价，加给良种籽棉奖励金；并免除轧花车捐税，减轻轧花费用，鼓励棉农出售籽花。棉农一般做到互相监督，集体保证，不私售，不混杂，仔细选种，妥善保存。
    湖北省棉田冬季休闲的很少，大多是棉麦兼种。一般棉农种小麦是撒播，因此麦田里种棉花也是撒播。这样对于出苗、保苗、锄草都有很大妨碍，直接影响了产量。两年来在改良棉区推行小麦条播法，再在麦行里点播棉花，已取得很大成绩。我们正在这个基础上进一步推广棉花条播法。棉农已经逐步体会到点播和条播比撒播优越得多，江陵县大部分棉田今年都改用条播和点播。农民刘先学说：
    “条播比撒播强得多，比点播也强，不但少耗费许多种籽，而且便于留苗、定苗，移栽也方便，可以保证全苗，锄草、施肥、治虫、摘棉花也都方便省工。政府考究过的事没有错！”但不少棉农还认为“条播小麦会减收”，认为“点播和条播没有撒播出苗可靠”。因此，还须不断利用各种方式教育棉农，保证先进耕作技术能贯彻到群众中去。
    棉农有不少良好的植棉习惯，农民也有丰富的智慧，创造了很多切实可行的耕作技术和植棉器械。新洲县棉农长于移植，棉花丰产模范孙少清就是移植能手。他移植的成活率经常达到百分之百，保证了全苗，也就保证了丰收，打破了“哭不活的妈，栽不活的花”的保守说法。“棉薅七道白如银”“锄头底下能生水（多锄可以防旱）”等等，已经成为棉农的普遍经验。江陵县弥陀寺棉农文裕坤创造了五齿中耕器，每天二人可中耕锄草十六到二十亩，极受附近农民欢迎。在防虫除虫方面，农民也有很多土方土法，行之有效。只要重视农民这些良好植棉习惯和丰富的智慧，进一步加以提高和推广，棉花产量就可逐步增加。
    目前亟须解决的几个问题
    第一、及时进行移苗补植，保证全苗。今年各地棉花播种较早，四月初就开始下种了。但由于春雨影响，播种期拖得很长，直至五月中旬还有少数棉田没有播完。大部分棉苗生长旺盛，一部分因播后遇雨，出苗不齐。损苗最严重的地区达到百分之五十以上。各地已抓紧时间，进行补种。现在仍有少数棉田缺苗，但因补种已迟，应抓紧时机，领导棉农移苗补植，广泛介绍移苗补植经验，保证全苗。
    第二、注意防旱防涝。湖北棉区地形复杂，岗地怕旱，湖地怕渍，江河沿岸怕洪水溃堤。今年伟大的荆江分洪工程开工，保证了湖北省重要棉区之一——荆州专区各县的棉花增产。其他干堤、民堤以及修塘、挖堰、开渠、修沟等农田水利工程，也取得了重大成就。但今春雨多，湖区棉田仍须注意开沟排水，保证棉苗不受水渍。汛期将到，必须加强防汛工作，保证不溃堤。岗地棉区领导机关要随时组织群众浇水防旱，保证棉花丰收。
    第三、解决普遍缺肥的问题。去冬今春湖北各地忙于土地改革和修堤等工作，未能大量积肥。很多农民重视水田施肥，忽视旱地施肥，现有肥料已经集中用于水田中，棉田普遍缺乏肥料。刚在土地改革中分到土地的雇农和贫农，肥料更感困难，且无现钱购买。各地应该抓紧时间，抢积一批肥料。现在全省二千万斤化学肥料（硫酸铔）已分配到各区，但由于群众没有施用这种肥料的习惯，怕烧庄稼、嫌价钱高，还没有全部贷出。要广泛深入地宣传硫酸铔的施用方法，解除棉农的思想顾虑。
    在丰产棉田中，施用氮肥多，而磷肥极少，配合不适当，可能发生疯长现象。在可能条件下，应加施米糠、鱼肥、鸡鸭粪，注意排水和灌水，并进行适当的整枝、摘心工作，防止疯长迟熟。
    第四、大力防治病虫害。湖北气候温湿，棉花病虫害特别多；加上去冬雪少，部分改良棉区因改良棉收得太迟，没有犁田，落叶落铃也未拣干净，害虫过冬死亡不多。因此，必须严密注意防治病虫害。今年蚜虫发生得特别早，红蜘蛛、土蚕、立枯病、炭疽病有的地方也已经发生。各地虽然已经掌握一部分药械，但不能解决全部问题。必须大力领导棉农进行人工防治，贯彻“早治、普治、连续治、彻底治”的方针。要普遍组织防虫除虫队伍，发动棉农购买烟茎，并召开棉农座谈会，交流讨论各种防虫除虫的办法；还要继续加强宣传工作，克服部分棉农怕麻烦、单纯等待政府贷放药械等的错误思想。
    第五、加强对丰产重点的领导，对棉农加强技术指导。各地党政机构必须加强对丰产重点的领导，用力培养，按时检查；同时应把棉农组织起来，发动竞赛，进行充分的爱国丰产竞赛的思想教育，及时把取得的经验全面推广。
    目前广大棉农迫切要求技术指导，特别是在新推广改良棉的地区，要求更为迫切。新洲县新洲区施庙乡农民张香山，因为不懂得种岱字棉的技术，只听说挖壋子好，就用菜刀把土挖起，放下棉籽，又把土还原，结果壋深土结，缺苗现象很严重。现在全省技术干部很少，应大量运用各种会议，并充分发挥乡村干部在土地改革以后领导生产的积极性，广泛而及时地组织经验交流会、技术研究会。新洲县新集乡召开了棉农座谈会，会上很多棉农误以为岱字棉要种得很稀才行，每亩只留一千四五百棵苗。棉花丰产模范孙少清等介绍经验以后，大家才同意棉花可以适当密植，决定每亩地要留二千棵左右的棉苗。由此可见，不加强对棉农进行技术指导，任其自流，棉花增产就会受很大影响。
