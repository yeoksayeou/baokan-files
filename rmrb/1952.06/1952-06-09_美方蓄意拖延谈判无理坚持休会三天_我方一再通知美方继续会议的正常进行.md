    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. Our Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation's Chief Liaison Officer, on the morning of the 8th at 8:30 AM, notified the other side under the order of Chief Delegate General Nam Il, requesting that the other side come to the meeting at 11:00 AM to continue the normal proceedings of the meeting. However, the other side still unreasonably insisted on a three-day recess and refused to come to the meeting, deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations. Our Chief Liaison Officer notified the other side again at 12:00 noon, stating: "I am ordered by our Chief Delegate to notify your side: The three-day recess is not valid without mutual agreement. The meeting should still be held at the normal scheduled time. Your side's refusal to come to the meeting at 11:00 AM on the morning of June 8th is without any reason. Please have your Chief Delegate come to the meeting at 11:00 AM on the morning of June 9th."
