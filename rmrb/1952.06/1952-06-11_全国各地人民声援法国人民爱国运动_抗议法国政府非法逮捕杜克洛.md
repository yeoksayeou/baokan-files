    Xinhua News Agency report: People across the country are actively supporting the French people's patriotic movement and protesting the French government's outrageous act of illegally arresting French people's leader Duclos.
    The people of Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces expressed great indignation at the atrocities of the French Pinay government. More than 300 representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin held a meeting on the 10th to support the French people's movement to defend peace and protest the French government's arrest of Duclos and other peace advocates. Representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing respect for the French people's just struggle against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world – the germ warfare criminal Ridgway – and strongly protested the French government's illegal atrocities of arresting Duclos, Stil, and other peace advocates. The Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and other people's organizations jointly issued a statement on the 7th, supporting the heroic struggle of the French people and resolutely demanding that the French government immediately release Duclos and other patriots. The Suiyuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Farmers' Association, and ten other people's organizations also jointly issued a letter of protest on the 7th, representing the three million Mongolian, Han, and Hui people of the province, demanding that the French government immediately release Duclos and other French patriots. In addition to lodging a strong protest against this atrocity of the French government, people's organizations in Hebei Province expressed their respect and condolences to the French people's leader Duclos.
    The Northeast Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Northeast Student Federation, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Northeast Association of Health Workers and other people's organizations jointly sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Pinay on the 10th, protesting the French government's outrageous act of illegally arresting French people's leader Duclos. The telegram pointed out: "The French people have waged a firm and unyielding struggle to oppose the germ warfare criminal Ridgway's plan to go to Western Europe to carry out the American aggressive war, and to prevent every man and woman in France and even Western Europe from suffering the disasters brought to them by this American plague god. The people of Northeast China, who have been poisoned by American germ warfare, feel particularly sympathetic to the French people's just struggle and are willing to give it strong support. Your government's attempt to suppress the just actions of the French peace-loving people through persecution, openly arresting French people's leader Mr. Duclos, the editor-in-chief of L'Humanité, Mr. Stil, and other patriots, and illegally searching the offices of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, is a shameful act of succumbing to war criminals and provoking peace-loving people. We resolutely demand that your government immediately stop this atrocity and promptly restore the freedom of Mr. Duclos and all patriots."
    More than 2,800 people from all walks of life in the Central South Region, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City held a rally on the evening of the 9th to support the French people's movement to defend peace and protest the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos. Zhao Yimin, Chairman of the Central South Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his opening speech: The French government arrested French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, "L'Humanité" editor-in-chief Stil, and many other French patriots because they defended peace and opposed the American war plan; because they fought for France's independence, opposed making the French people cannon fodder for American imperialism, and opposed giving French territory to American imperialism as a base for aggressive war. He emphasized that the French government, following the lead of American imperialism, has embarked on the road of fascism. However, the French people's patriotic movement to strive for independence and defend peace, which is developing day by day, will not be stopped by any conspiracy or atrocity and is bound to win. The speakers that followed included Zhao Min, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Huangmei, Chairman of the Central South Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zhang Haiwang, a farmer from the suburbs of Wuhan, Zou Dexin, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central South Democratic Women's Federation, Zhou Huanzhang, Chairman of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology Popularization, Chen Jianxun, a representative of the religious circles in Wuhan, Wang Yiming, a representative of the business community, and Chen Mingshu, Nie Guoqing, Hua Yuqing and others, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties. They unanimously protested the atrocities of the French government; and expressed warm sympathy and support to the French peace-loving people who were persecuted for striving for national independence and defending peace.
    People from all walks of life in Xi'an held a rally on the evening of the 9th. More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Xi'an, representatives of democratic parties in Northwest China, and representatives of ethnic minorities attended. Yang Mingxuan, Chairman of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He called on the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Northwest to step up production and strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to counter the provocations of the American aggressors and the French reactionaries against the French people and world peace. Hui representative Ma Fuchen, representatives of democratic parties, Yuan Ruoyu, head of the Xi'an organization of the Democratic League, Du Yanqing, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, Zhu Ping, Standing Committee Member of the Northwest Democratic Youth Federation, Zhang Zifang, Chairman of the Northwest Democratic Women's Federation, Feng Ruoci, Chairman of the Northwest Student Federation, Hou Zonglian, Director of the Xi'an Branch of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, Hou Wailu, President of Northwest University, Sun Weiru, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Consultative Committee, Liu Guangzhi, Standing Committee Member of the Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce, literary and art workers Liu Qing, Chang Xiangyu, as well as representatives of various ethnic groups and representatives of Christians and Buddhists, spoke at the meeting successively. They unanimously demanded that the French government immediately release Duclos and all patriots. Ke Zhongping, Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also recited a poem at the meeting entitled "Supporting the French People's Heroic Struggle".
    More than 40,000 people from all walks of life in Chongqing also held a mass rally on the afternoon of the 9th. Ren Baige, Chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered the opening speech, pointing out that this meeting fully demonstrated the common will of the two million people of Chongqing to resolutely support the French people's patriotic movement and resolutely protest the atrocities of the French government in illegally arresting Duclos and other French people's leaders. Chu Tunan, Chairman of the Southwest Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting, followed by speeches by well-known people from all walks of life in Chongqing. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the French people and their firm belief that the French people will win the final victory. At the end of the meeting, all participants shouted slogans such as "Demand that the French government immediately release Duclos and Stil!", "Down with the germ warfare criminal Ridgway!", "Resolutely support the French people's patriotic movement!"
    The conferences in Wuhan, Xi'an, and Chongqing respectively passed two telegrams expressing support for the French people's patriotic movement and protesting the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos.
