    Remarkable Achievements in Promoting the Quick Literacy Method

    To the Editor: Xiguxian Village, in the fourth district of Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, used to be a culturally backward place. Out of 236 households in the village, there were as many as 680 illiterate young and middle-aged people. After the land reform, the peasants' desire to learn to read and write became increasingly urgent. Li Jinyu said, "If we can't understand the instruction manuals for new-style farm tools, we won't even be able to farm the land in the future."

    Last autumn, the village established a cultural study class. After two months of study, each person had only learned an average of three or four hundred characters. As a result, the students felt unmotivated and were unwilling to continue their studies.

    In January of this year, the Tunliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the village to adopt the quick literacy method of teaching. When the students heard that the quick literacy method could enable each person to learn one or two hundred characters in a day, the number of people participating in the study suddenly increased from a dozen to thirty-one. However, they were somewhat skeptical in their hearts, fearing that this might not be true. Some people said, "We have never seen such a strange thing." Qin Fuquan said, "I'm afraid that before we even learn the phonetic alphabet, we will forget the characters we already know." Some elderly people, hearing the young people reciting the alphabet, said in a mocking tone, "Hee hee ya ya, be careful not to bite your tongues off!" Zhang Jinlei is the secretary of the village's Communist Youth League branch. When he participated in the quick literacy class, his uncle even ridiculed him: "You are really learning art at an old age, wasting your work points for nothing!" But he was not discouraged. He studied hard, learned the phonetic symbols in one go on the first day, learned "moving" on the fourth day, and recognized more than 1,600 characters on the sixth day. He can now read popular newspapers and magazines such as the Shanxi Peasant's Daily, Youth Daily, and North China People's Daily, which he couldn't understand in the past; he can also write simple reports and summaries. His uncle also admitted that he really "didn't learn for nothing."

    After a short period of study, most of the students can read popular reading materials and write simple letters. Youth League member Zhao Yinfeng said, "In the past, the letters my man sent from Taiyuan, if I didn't let others see them, I couldn't read them myself; if I let others see them, they would know all my intimate words. Now I don't have to worry about that."

    Now, the people of Xiguxian Village are saying: In the past, our village was a poor gully with few literate people, but now it's different. Everyone is learning culture, and it's about to become a "cultural gully."

    山西省屯留县西故县村
    推行速成识字法有成绩
    编辑同志：山西省屯留县四区西故县村，过去是一个文化落后的地方。全村二百三十六户中，只青壮年文盲就有六百八十人。土地改革以后，农民学习文化的要求越来越迫切。李金玉说：“要是看不懂新式农具的说明书，今后连地都种不好。”
    去年秋天，村里成立了文化补习班，学习了两个月，每人平均只认识了三、四百字。因此，学员们感到没劲，都不愿继续参加学习了。
    今年一月间，中共屯留县委员会指示该村采用速成识字法教学。学员们听说速成识字法可以使每人在一天内认识一、二百字，参加学习的人数突然由十几人增加到三十一人。可是他们心里总有点怀疑，怕这不会是事实。有的人说：“咱没有见过这样希奇的事。”秦富全说：“怕注音字母还没学会，连以前识的字都要忘了。”有些老年人听到年青人在那里念字母，带着嘲笑的口吻说：“噫噫呀呀的，当心不要把舌头咬掉了！”张金垒是村青年团的支部书记，他参加速成识字班学习的时候，他伯父还讽刺他：“你真是年老还学艺，白误工！”可是他并不灰心。他努力学习，第一天一股劲就学会了注音符号，第四天学会了“搬家”，第六天就认识了一千六百多字。过去看不懂的山西农民报、青年报、华北人民等通俗报刊，他现在都能看下去了；他也能写简单的汇报和总结报告了。他伯父也承认他真的
    “没白学了”。
    经过短期的学习，大部分学员都能读通俗的读物和写简单的信了。女青年团员赵银峰说：“过去俺男人从太原来的信，不让别人看吧，自己又不认得，让别人看吧，有啥知心话也都让人家知道了。这回可不发愁了。”
    现在，西故县村的人都这么说：过去俺村是穷河沟，识字的人不多，现在可不同了，人人都学文化，快要变成“文化沟”了。
