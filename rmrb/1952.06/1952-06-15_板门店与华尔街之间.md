Between Panmunjom and Wall Street
Chen Youwei

The Korean armistice negotiations have entered their twelfth month. Over this long period, thanks to the continuous efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, agreements have been reached on most of the major issues in the negotiations. However, just as the prospect of an armistice was in sight, the American generals resorted to blatant trickery on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war, stubbornly clinging to their absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal, which had long been bankrupt. Ridgway, Joy, and their successors Clark and Harrison, repeatedly claimed that they had "unlimited sincerity" in the armistice negotiations and were "solely concerned about the welfare of these people (the prisoners) and the sorrow of their families," and therefore would "under no circumstances" "abandon this humanitarian principle of non-forcible repatriation." But people all over the world are daily listening with anger to the news of American executioners slaughtering prisoners of war from Geoje Island, and are watching the "longest armistice negotiations in history" at Panmunjom continue to drag on under the so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable" tyrannical attitude of the American generals.

Why do the American generals insist on delaying and sabotaging the negotiations? What ulterior motives do they harbor? From the American newspapers, we can find the correct answers. The "U.S. News & World Report" weekly, published on May 16, wrote in its "Tomorrow" column: "The war, which affects everything, will continue in Korea. The truce talks are close to breaking down. The truce itself has always been doubtful, and now appears even less likely. ... If a truce is not implemented, the U.S. arms expansion will continue as planned. If military spending is to be cut, it will not be cut by much." And "If military spending is not significantly reduced, it will guarantee active commercial activity. ... The business slump expected in 1953 in the event of a truce is less likely to occur if the war continues." Prior to this, the American Catholic weekly "America" had also openly admitted that the Korean War "is the stimulus that accelerates our own military buildup and gives the North Atlantic Treaty Organization more vitality." The mouthpieces of the American ruling class have nakedly revealed the flesh-and-blood relationship between Wall Street and the Korean War, and their despicable attitude towards the Panmunjom negotiations.

For the big financial magnates of Wall Street, war means making money. While countless tons of steel explosives are raining down on Sinuiju, Pyongyang, and other Korean cities, while napalm bombs and machine guns are cruelly slaughtering unarmed residents of Hwanghae Province, while tens of thousands of American soldiers are falling on the Korean fields, countless amounts of money are pouring into the safes of Detroit arms dealers and New York stockbrokers. At the end of the first quarter of this year, the "Wall Street Journal" successively published some bloody figures. They showed that the American companies that massively produce killing weapons have reached new profit peaks in the past year. Comparing 1951 with 1949, the profits of "U.S. Steel" increased by 99.6%, "General Electric" more than doubled, "Goodyear Tire & Rubber" increased by 168%, and "DuPont," which started by manufacturing explosives and is now accepting orders for atomic bombs, had an annual profit of as high as 592.2 million US dollars before taxes in 1951. The Korean War has allowed the Wall Street bosses to drink their fill of blood, and they are afraid of losing some of their financial resources due to the Korean armistice.

To make the facts even clearer, we might as well look back.

Two years ago, when Wall Street's lackeys ignited the flames of war on the 38th parallel, the joy of those American business giants who were constantly worried about the arrival of a commercial depression was indescribable. "Automobile King" Ford cheered with great excitement: "War saved our business from collapsing." The New York Times declared with satisfaction: "Washington has become the Mecca of businessmen again." And "Business Magazine" believed that "entrepreneurs will demand their share of the billions of dollars of government military contracts." As a result, the US Congress immediately passed military appropriations; Wilson, the manager of "General Electric," was recommended as the representative of the entrepreneurs to serve as the director of the Defense Mobilization Agency, "responsible for guiding all government mobilization activities, including production, procurement, manpower, and transportation." The docile servant Truman beat the drums of war to the whole country, announcing that the United States had entered a state of "emergency." The war hysteria and the war itself sparked a buying and hoarding spree among American residents, so the sales of stores immediately reached new records, and the profits of large companies immediately rolled in with the government's large-scale military orders.

In early July last year, when kind people all over the world warmly welcomed Malik's peace proposal, and American soldiers shouted, "The ceasefire should be as soon as possible, no one wants to be the last to die in this war," the reaction of Wall Street and the White House was completely different. Therefore, just as the Americans had to sit down to negotiate, Truman quickly declared that "Korea is only part of a broader conflict... we must continue to expand our military forces..." Acheson immediately warned: "Regardless of whether there will be peace in Korea,... our task remains the same as before." At that time, the director of the US Defense Mobilization Agency was not only "deeply shocked" by this situation, but even said that he had "never felt so anxious about the 'security' of the United States as he does now in his life."

As a result, people saw the American aggressors provoke while negotiating, and expand their military frantically while talking about peace. The aggressors do not have the strength to win the war, but they are unwilling to end this war. The Korean War allows them to continue to maintain international tensions. Relying on it, the Wall Street bosses maintained their high profits, and the rulers in Washington intensified their exploitation of the American people, adding military spending to an unprecedentedly huge figure of 81.8 billion. It is precisely for this reason that Harrison, who is at a loss for words, repeats his platitudes in the Panmunjom conference tent every day with a straight face, and even arrogantly unilaterally adjourns the meeting for three days, deliberately sabotaging the negotiations.

Things are becoming more and more obvious. The arrogant attitude of the Americans at the negotiating table and their bloody atrocities on Geoje Island prove that they want to continue to delay the negotiations. The "New York Times" estimates that "the Allied negotiators are prepared to spend the entire summer in Panmunjom," while "U.S. News & World Report" believes even more that "this novel war can continue for many years."

However, the aggressors' conspiracies and their intimidation and clamor will not achieve their goals, but will only make the people of the world further recognize the warmongering nature and ugly face of imperialism. People are unwilling to risk their lives for Wall Street to plunder Korean tungsten mines and increase the circles on their corporate income statements; what people want is peace and life. Whether the armistice negotiations can reach an agreement as soon as possible depends on the sincerity of the US side; but on the whole, the victory or defeat in the struggle between peace and war is determined by the peace-loving people. When MacArthur directed his troops to land triumphantly in Incheon and advance towards the Yalu River, the aggressors would never have thought of the word "negotiation"; it was only after their sinful clutches were cut bloody and shrunk back to the 38th parallel by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies that they had to sit down to negotiate. As for us, we not only have the strength to crush the enemy's armed aggression, but we must also have the strength to crush any of their conspiracies to delay and sabotage the negotiations. If the insatiable Wall Street bosses and their agents in the White House and the Pentagon are still unrepentant and continue to do evil, then they will surely taste the bitter fruit they have sown themselves.

    板门店与华尔街之间
    陈有为
    朝鲜停战谈判进入了第十二个月。在过去这一段漫长的日子里，由于朝中方面代表不断地努力，使得谈判中的主要问题大都达成了协议。但是当实行停战的前景已经在望的时候，美国将军们却在双方交换战俘的问题上大耍无赖，抱着他们早已破产了的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张死命不放。李奇微、乔埃及其后继者克拉克、哈利逊之流，口口声声说他们对于停战谈判有着“无限诚意”，“一心只想到这些人（俘虏）的福利和他们家庭的哀痛”，因而“无论如何”也“决不背弃这种不强迫遣返的人道主义的原则”。但是全世界人民却每天都怀着愤怒的心情，来听取从巨济岛传来的美国刽子手们屠杀战俘的消息，并且眼看着板门店进行的“历史上最长的一次休战谈判”，在美国将军们所谓“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”横蛮态度之下，继续拖延下去。
    美国将军们为什么一定要拖延和破坏谈判呢？他们究竟怀着什么样的不可告人的目的呢？从美国的报刊上，我们可以找出正确的答案。五月十六日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊，在它的“明日”专栏里这样写道：“影响一切的战争，将在朝鲜继续下去。休战谈判已接近破裂。休战本身原来始终是可以怀疑的，现在则已显出更少可能了。……如果不实行休战，美国的扩军仍将按照计划进行。军费如果要削减，也不会减得很多。”而“军费如果不予大量削减，将可保证活跃的商业活动。……预计因万一休战而将于一九五三年发生的商业萧条，如果战争继续下去的话，爆发的可能性即可减少。”在这以前，美国的天主教周刊“美国”也曾公开承认朝鲜战争“就是加速我们自己军备和促使北大西洋公约组织有更多生气的刺激物”。美国统治集团的喉舌，赤裸裸地道出了华尔街与朝鲜战争之间的血肉关系，和他们对于板门店谈判所抱的卑劣态度。
    对于华尔街的大财主们来说，战争就是发财。当无数吨的钢铁炸药倾泻在新义州、平壤和别的朝鲜城镇的时候，当凝固汽油弹和机关枪残酷地屠杀手无寸铁的黄海道居民的时候，当成千成万美国士兵倒在朝鲜田野上的时候，无数的金元却大量地涌进了底特律军火商与纽约股票经纪人的保险箱里。在今年第一季末，“华尔街日报”先后发表了一些带有血腥味的数字。它们表明了那些大规模制造杀人利器的美国公司，又在去年度达到了利润的新高峰。拿一九五一年与一九四九年比较，“美国钢铁公司”的利润增加了百分之九十九点六，“通用电气公司”增加了一倍以上，“固得异轮胎与橡胶公司”增加了百分之一百六十八，以制造炸药起家而今天正在接受原子弹定货的“杜邦公司”，一九五一年纳税前的年利也高达五亿九千二百万美元。朝鲜战争已经使华尔街老板们喝饱了鲜血，他们唯恐因朝鲜停战而失去自己的一部分财源。
    为了把事实说得更清楚些，我们不妨再回过头来看看。
    两年之前，当华尔街的走狗在“三八”线上点燃战火的时候，那些终日担心商业萧条来临的美国企业巨子们的喜悦是难以形容的。“汽车大王”福特兴高采烈地欢呼：“战争使我们的生意没有垮台”。纽约时报满意地声称：“华盛顿又成了生意人的麦加”。而“商业杂志”则相信“企业家们都会要求从政府在军事合同上的亿万金元中得到自己的一份”。于是美国国会立刻通过了军事拨款；“通用电气公司”的经理威尔生当作企业家的代理人被推荐出来担任了国防动员署的署长，“负责指导政府的一切动员活动，包括生产、采购、人力、运输”。驯顺的奴仆杜鲁门向全国敲起了战争的锣鼓，宣布美国进入“紧急状态”。战争的歇斯底里和战争本身掀起了美国居民们的抢购和囤积风潮，于是商店的销售额立刻达到了新的纪录，而大公司的利润也就立刻随着政府的大批军事定货滚滚而来。
    去年七月初，当全世界善良的人民伸手热烈欢迎马立克的和平建议、美国士兵连呼“停火应该愈快愈好，没有人想在这次战争中做一个最后的送死鬼”的时候，华尔街与白宫的反应却是完全不同的。因此，就在美国人不得不坐下来谈判的同时，杜鲁门却赶紧声明“朝鲜只是更广泛的冲突的一部分……我们必须继续扩充我们的军事力量……”，艾奇逊立刻发出警告：“不管朝鲜是否会有和平，……我们的任务还是和从前一样。”而那时的美国国防动员署署长则不但对于这种情形“深为震惊”，甚至表示他“有生以来从来没有对美国的‘安全’像目前这样感到焦虑。”
    于是，人们就看到美国侵略者一边谈判，一边挑衅；一边侈谈和平，一边疯狂扩军。侵略者没有力量赢得战争，但他们也不愿意结束这个战争。朝鲜战争使得他们能够继续保持国际间的紧张局势。依靠了它，华尔街老板保持了他们的高额利润，华盛顿的统治者加紧了他们对美国人民的搜刮，把军费追加到八百十八亿的空前庞大的数字。正是由于这个原因，理屈辞穷的哈利逊每天老着脸皮在板门店会议帐篷里重复着他的陈腔滥调，甚至狂妄到片面休会三天，蓄意破坏谈判。
    事情是愈来愈明显了。美国人在谈判桌上的蛮横态度和他们在巨济岛上的血腥暴行，证明他们还要使谈判继续拖延下去。“纽约时报”估计“联军谈判代表已准备在板门店度过整个夏天”，而“美国新闻与世界报道”则更认为“这种新頴的战争可以继续进行许多年。”
    但是，侵略者的阴谋和他们的恐吓、叫嚣不会达到他们的目的，而只会使全世界人民更进一步认清帝国主义的好战本质和它的丑恶面貌。人们不愿意为华尔街掠夺朝鲜钨矿和增加他们企业收益表上的圈圈去卖命；人们要求的是和平，生活。停战谈判是否能够早日达成协议，虽然要看美方的有否诚意；但是整个说来，和平与战争的搏斗的胜负，却是决定于爱好和平的人民的。当麦克阿瑟指挥着他的军队得意忘形地登陆仁川、进逼鸭绿江的时候，侵略者是绝对不会想到“谈判”这个字的；只是在它们罪恶的魔手被中朝人民军队砍得鲜血淋淋而缩回“三八”线以后，它们才不得不坐下来谈判。而我们呢，我们既有力量粉碎敌人的武装侵略，也一定有力量粉碎它们拖延与破坏谈判的任何阴谋。贪得无餍的华尔街老板和他们在白宫与五角大楼的代理人如果仍然毫无悔祸之心，继续作恶，那就一定会尝到他们自己种下的苦果。
