Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: After a series of bloody massacres and cruel persecutions on Geoje Island, the American aggressors are now massively arresting our captured personnel, insisting that they should be responsible for the American massacres, attempting to use this absurd and despicable gangster tactic to achieve their shameless goal of both shifting their own blame and murdering to silence.

According to American news agencies, after the massacre on June 10th, the executioner Boatner shamelessly shifted the responsibility for the massacre onto the representatives of our prisoners of war, illegally arresting Li Hanggu (transliteration), the representative of our captured personnel in the 76th POW camp. According to a Reuters dispatch from Geoje Island on the 11th, Boatner had already handed him over to U.S. military intelligence for interrogation. In addition to Li Hanggu, Boatner admitted that he also arrested sixteen to eighteen of our captured personnel on the 10th, including three women. According to American news agency reports, these arrested people were the representatives of our captured personnel sent from various camps to the 76th POW camp during the Dodd incident. They were acknowledged by Colonel Kalsen, the person in charge of the American POW camp at the time.

Observers here point out: Executioner Boatner's illegal arrest of them is clearly a barbaric act of retaliation for the Dodd incident. This is another blatant act by the U.S. side to violate the Geneva Convention. Article 80 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War clearly stipulates: "Prisoner representatives shall not be held responsible for any misconduct committed by prisoners of war solely because of their duties." Moreover, the fact is that the U.S. side used tanks, tear gas, and flamethrowers to attack our unarmed captured personnel, and our captured personnel have no fault at all. Boatner's handing over of our POW representatives to U.S. military intelligence for interrogation is also a violation of the Geneva Convention. Article 84 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be tried only by military courts"; Article 99 stipulates: "No moral or physical coercion may be exercised on a prisoner of war in order to induce him to admit guilt of the act of which he is accused." The U.S. military intelligence, which has inherited all the mantle of the Hitler secret police, is known to the world for its cruelty and tyranny. Boatner illegally handed over our POW representatives to such an agency for interrogation, with the aim of subjecting them to cruel abuse and forcing them to admit so-called "misconduct."

Following this barbaric act that completely violated the Geneva Convention, the U.S. side announced on the 12th that it had arrested three of our captured personnel in Camp 95. On the 14th, according to an Associated Press report, the U.S. side arrested another 102 people and took the opportunity to detain 273 of our captured personnel as "anti-communist prisoners." On the 17th, according to a United Press report, Boatner announced that he had arrested another seven of our captured personnel, insisting that they had killed sixteen "non-communist prisoners" in the POW camp. This is a shameless conspiracy by the American aggressors to frame and slander, and to shirk their own responsibilities. In order to create an excuse to continue large-scale arrests and persecutions, Boatner claimed that he had found a "Geoje Island Tsar" among the arrested personnel who could control all the camps on the island.

Observers here believe that our captured personnel are imprisoned separately in several camps, each camp surrounded by several barbed wire fences, and guarded by sixty tanks and more than 18,000 U.S. soldiers (according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Geoje Island on the 16th), and they can still control all the camps on the island. Isn't this a myth? Everyone knows that the brutal and inhumane "Tsar" on Geoje Island is none other than the executioner Boatner himself. The U.S. side apparently believes that with such a myth, it can arbitrarily arrest and kill our captured personnel in large numbers based on the "confessions" they fabricated themselves. However, no matter what insidious and vicious methods the U.S. side uses to deceive world public opinion, their despicable goals will never be achieved. Their flagrant violation of the Geneva Convention, massacre and persecution of prisoners of war, and use of forced "screening" to detain prisoners of war and other heinous crimes have long been admitted by American generals Dodd and Kalsen, and the evidence is conclusive and undeniable. The new crimes committed by the American aggressors on Geoje Island can only further expose their hideous faces before the people of the world and further arouse the righteous indignation of all fair-minded people.

### 美方竟大规模逮捕我方被俘人员  企图达到推卸罪责和杀人灭口的无耻目的

    美方竟大规模逮捕我方被俘人员
    企图达到推卸罪责和杀人灭口的无耻目的
    【新华社开城十九日电】美国侵略者在巨济岛上进行了一连串的血腥屠杀和残酷迫害之后，现在又在大规模逮捕我方被俘人员，硬说他们应该对美方的这种屠杀负责，企图用这种荒谬而又卑鄙的流氓手法，达到其既推卸了自己的罪责，又可以杀人灭口的无耻目的。
    据美国的通讯社透露，在六月十日的大屠杀以后，刽子手波纳无耻地将这次屠杀的责任转嫁在我方战俘代表的身上，非法地逮捕了第七十六号战俘营的我方被俘人员的代表李涵谷（译音）。据路透社巨济岛十一日电称，波纳已经将他交给美军情报机关进行审问。除了李涵谷以外，波纳承认在十日还逮捕了十六个到十八个我方被俘人员，内有三名妇女。根据美国的通讯社的报道，这些被捕的人就是在杜德事件发生时由各营场派到第七十六号战俘营中去的我方被俘人员的代表。他们是得到了当时美方俘虏营负责人柯尔生的承认的。
    此间观察家指出：刽子手波纳非法逮捕他们，显然是对杜德事件的野蛮报复行为。这是美方又一粗暴地破坏日内瓦公约的行为。关于战俘待遇的一九四九年日内瓦公约的第八十条明明规定：“不应使战俘代表仅仅由于其所担负之职务而对战俘所犯之任何过失负责。”更何况事实是美方用坦克、催泪弹、喷火器进攻赤手空拳的我方被俘人员，我方被俘人员根本就没有过失可言。波纳将我方战俘代表交给美军情报机关审问，同样是破坏日内瓦公约的行为。日内瓦公约第八十四条规定：“战俘只应由军事法庭审判”；第九十九条规定：“不得对战俘施用精神上或肉体上的强制压力，以使其承认被控的罪行。”继承了希特勒秘密警察的全部衣钵的美军情报机关，是以残忍暴虐闻名于世的，波纳将我方战俘代表非法交给这样的机关审问，目的就是要对他进行残酷的虐待，并迫使他承认所谓“过失”。
    继这一完全破坏日内瓦公约的野蛮行为以后，十二日，美方又宣布在九十五号营场中逮捕了三名我方被俘人员。十四日，据美联社消息，美方又逮捕了一百零二人，并乘机将二百七十三名我方被俘人员当作“反共的俘虏”扣留下来。十七日，据合众社消息，波纳宣布他又逮捕了七名我方被俘人员，硬说他们在战俘营中杀害了十六名“非共产党俘虏”。这是美国侵略者栽赃诬控、推卸自己罪责的无耻阴谋。为了给继续进行大规模的逮捕和迫害制造藉口，波纳宣称他已经在被逮捕的我方被俘人员中找到了能够控制岛上所有营场的“巨济岛上的沙皇”。
    此间观察家认为：我方被俘人员分别被囚禁在若干个营场里面，每个营场四面围着几道铁丝网，受着六十辆坦克，一万八千多名美方士兵（据法新社巨济岛十六日电透露）的监视，居然还能控制岛上所有营场，这不是神话是什么？谁都知道，巨济岛上残暴不仁的“沙皇”不是别人，正是刽子手波纳自己。美方显然以为凭着这么一个神话，就可以根据他们自己制造出来的“口供”，大批地任意逮捕和杀害我方被俘人员了。可是，无论美方使用什么阴险恶毒的办法来欺骗世界舆论，他们的卑鄙目的是绝对达不到的，他们的悍然破坏日内瓦公约、屠杀和迫害战俘、用强迫“甄别”来扣留战俘等等万恶罪行，早已为美国将军杜德和柯尔生所供认，证据确凿，无可抵赖。美国侵略者在巨济岛所犯的新罪行，只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露它的狰狞面目，更加激起一切公正人士的义愤。
