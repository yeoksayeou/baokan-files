    Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of Our Captured Personnel
    The news of the large-scale massacre of our captured personnel by the U.S. military on Geoje Island cannot but enrage anyone with a modicum of humanity. An Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on the 10th called this massacre "the worst battle on the island." The commander of this massacre was General Boatner, the commander of the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, who "personally directed the battle from a hilltop." However, people all over the world will see that this American butcher's so-called "battle" is extremely shameful.
    Throughout the history of warfare, conducting a "battle" against unarmed captured personnel has always been the most despicable act! Only American "generals" who suffer crushing defeats on the battlefield become "heroes" by showing off their might in prisoner-of-war camps. The United Press stated that their "troops, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, stormed into the camp, firing approximately one thousand flame-thrower shells, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades. American soldiers on tanks and on foot opened fire on large groups of shouting Communist prisoners." Thus, "the battle lasting one hour and fifty minutes" began. This is the whole truth of this so-called "battle."
    Boatner's statement after the massacre is particularly shameless. He actually said, "It is extremely regrettable that casualties had to be caused as a result of the Communist prisoners' refusal to carry out the order for peaceful relocation." However, everyone knows that the U.S. side's massacre was carried out after a long period of preparation. A Reuters dispatch on the 9th also admitted that Boatner had told reporters that "all preparations for the major operation were complete," and that the U.S. military had already conducted massacre drills. This is an indisputable fact!
    The U.S. side has repeatedly and publicly clamored to exact a price from the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war for the Dodd and Colson incidents. However, the American butchers can never change the bloody crimes of the U.S. side in abusing and massacring prisoners of war, as admitted by Dodd and Colson, and will only make its crimes even more serious. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th, "Colson said that his action of drafting, signing, and handing over the letter of concession to the Communists was not only completely justified, but also approved by his superior headquarters." The massacre directed by Boatner now was obviously carried out under the instructions of his superior headquarters. This even more thoroughly proves that the crimes of the U.S. side in violating the Geneva Convention, as admitted by Dodd and Colson, are too numerous to count.
    Just as the U.S. side was preparing for and carrying out the massacre on Geoje Island, the U.S. side refused to attend the Panmunjom meetings for days and unilaterally interrupted the normal process of the Korean armistice negotiations. This fully proves that the U.S. side is deliberately provoking us. Now the people of the world have the right to question the United States: Does the United States still want to continue negotiations? If the United States no longer wants to negotiate, then it should simply admit it publicly. The U.S. side’s shameless behavior of playing delaying tactics on the one hand, and carrying out an unprecedented massacre of prisoners of war on the other, will definitely not escape its serious consequences.
    Nuckols, the spokesman for the U.S. negotiating delegation, said in Munsan on the 10th, "If the propaganda attacks are again intolerable, the Allied side may forcibly adjourn the meeting again." This is another shameless nonsense. We want to ask, what kind of "intolerable" "propaganda attacks" have we launched? What we cannot but "attack" is the U.S. side's absurd claim to forcibly detain our captured personnel and the bloody crime of massacring our captured personnel. Should such a "intolerable" bloody massacre on Geoje Island not be "attacked"? Obviously, we must "attack" this kind of crime to the end! Since the U.S. side dares to commit such "intolerable" crimes, why doesn't it have the courage to face just "attacks"? If the U.S. side wants to avoid being "attacked," it can only admit all responsibility for the massacre of our captured personnel, abandon its absurd claim to forcibly detain our captured personnel, accept our fair and reasonable proposal on the issue of prisoner repatriation, and remove the last and only obstacle in the Korean armistice negotiations. There is absolutely no other way out!
    We firmly believe that the great and just struggle waged by our captured personnel on Geoje Island for the sacred right to return home and live a peaceful life will surely receive the full support of the Chinese and Korean people and the support of all just people in the world.

### 坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义斗争

    坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义斗争
    巨济岛美军大规模屠杀我被俘人员的消息，使稍有人性的人都不能不震怒了。美联社巨济岛十日电讯中把这个大屠杀叫做“这个岛上最恶劣的一场战斗”。这个大屠杀的指挥者是巨济岛美军俘虏营的司令官波纳，他“站在小山上亲自指挥战斗”。但是，全世界人民都会看到这个美国屠夫的所谓“战斗”是可耻到极点了。
    在世界战争史上向手无寸铁的被俘人员进行“战斗”，向来是被人唾弃的最卑怯的行为！只有在战场上碰得头破血流的美国“将军”们，才是在俘虏营中大逞其威风的“英雄”。合众社称述他们的“军队在坦克和装甲车掩护下冲入营场，发射了约一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹。坦克上的和步行的美国士兵向大声喊叫的大群共俘开火。”于是“经过一小时又五十分钟的战斗”就这样开始了。这就是这一场所谓“战斗”的全部真相。
    波纳在大屠杀之后所发表的声明尤其是无耻的。他居然说“由于共俘拒不执行安然迁移的命令，结果不得不引起这种伤亡，这是极其遗憾的事。”但是，谁都知道美方进行这次大屠杀是经过长时间的准备的。路透社九日的电讯中也承认波纳对记者说过“大行动的一切准备俱已就绪”，并且美军早已进行了大屠杀的演习，这是无可置辩的事实！
    美方屡次公开扬言要向朝中战俘索取杜德和柯尔生事件的代价，但是，美国的屠夫们永远不能改变杜德和柯尔生所承认的美方虐待和屠杀战俘的血腥罪行，而只会使它的罪行愈加严重。据合众社华盛顿十日的电讯，“柯尔生说，他起草、签字再交给共产党的让步信件这一行动不仅完全有理，而且也得到他上级总部的同意。”现在波纳所指挥的大屠杀，显然同样是在他上级总部的指使下进行的，这更加彻底地证明杜德和柯尔生所承认的美方违反日内瓦公约的罪行是罄竹难书的了。
    正当美方准备和进行巨济岛大屠杀的时候，美方连日拒绝出席板门店的会议，单方面地中断了朝鲜停战谈判的正常进程，这完全证明美方是有计划地在向我方挑衅。现在全世界人民都有权质问美国，究竟美国还愿意不愿意继续谈判，如果美国已经不愿意谈判下去，那就应该干脆公开承认，而美国现在一面对谈判会议耍弄拖延手段，一面对战俘实行空前大屠杀的无耻行径，则断然不能逃避其严重的后果。
    美方谈判代表团的发言人纳科斯十日在汶山发表谈话说，“如果宣传攻击又叫人难以容忍，联军方面再次强行休会是有可能的”。这又是一个无耻的胡说。我们要问，我方做了什么样的“叫人难以容忍”的“宣传攻击”？我方所不能不“攻击”的乃是美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张和屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行。对于巨济岛的这样“叫人难以容忍”的血腥大屠杀，难道还不应该加以“攻击”吗？显然的，对于这种罪行，我们必须“攻击”到底！美方胆敢做出这样“叫人难以容忍”的罪行，为什么却没有胆量迎受正义的“攻击”呢？美方要使自己不受“攻击”，只有承认屠杀我方被俘人员的一切责任，并且放弃强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，接受我方关于遣俘问题的公平合理的主张，撤除朝鲜停战谈判中的最后唯一的障碍，舍此以外就决没有出路！
    在巨济岛上的我方被俘人员为回家过和平生活的神圣权利进行了伟大的正义斗争，我们深信，这个斗争必将得到中朝人民的全力支持，必将得到全世界正义人类的支持。
