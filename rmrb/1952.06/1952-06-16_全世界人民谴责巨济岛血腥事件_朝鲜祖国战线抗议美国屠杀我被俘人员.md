    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a meeting on the 12th. After listening to a report by Jeong No-sik, one of the chairmen of the Presidium, on "The Atrocities of the American Aggressors in Abusing and Killing Our Captured Personnel," the meeting held a heated discussion. The meeting decided on countermeasures against the struggle to oppose and protest the atrocities of American imperialism in abusing and killing our captured personnel, and adopted a statement denouncing and protesting the atrocities of American imperialism.
    The protest statement said: The criminal atrocities committed by American imperialism in Korea are endless. The American aggressors have turned Geoje Island, which houses our captured personnel, into a "Island of Death," creating a living hell like "Majdanek" and "Auschwitz." The brutality shown by the American aggressors in Korea exceeds that of the Hitler gang, who received their due punishment in Nuremberg.
    The statement pointed out: The truth about the crimes of American imperialists in massacring our captured personnel can no longer be covered up, and it has spread widely throughout the world. All the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world are opposing and solemnly protesting this unprecedented bloody atrocity of the American executioners against our captured personnel. The Korean people will absolutely not tolerate the American beasts using the blood of our people to stain our beautiful land and committing heinous atrocities on our territory. The beasts will not escape their guilt.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, representing all political parties, social organizations, and the entire Korean people, with unparalleled anger and hatred, seriously protests the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in massacring our captured personnel, and firmly demands that the US side immediately stop these atrocities and must provide our captured personnel with reasonable treatment as prisoners of war as stipulated by the Geneva Convention and other internationally recognized international laws.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front firmly insists that the legitimate rights of our captured personnel must be guaranteed in accordance with international law, and opposes so-called "voluntary repatriation" and forced "screening."
    The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front appeals to all freedom-loving people in the world to quickly stop the war of aggression waged by American imperialism in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, and force it to unconditionally repatriate prisoners of war after the armistice.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front is convinced that the American war criminals who massacred our captured personnel and directly organized and carried out these atrocities will be judged and punished as they deserve in front of the good people of the world.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a Xinhua News Agency report: The atrocities of the American aggressors in continuing the bloody massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island have aroused even greater anger among the people of the world. In the Soviet Union, in the German Democratic Republic, and even in the United States, people have raised strong protests.
    Millions of Soviet people unanimously demanded an end to the atrocities of the American aggressors in massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The city of Vitebsk in Belarus held a city-wide conference, and those attending the conference unanimously condemned the American interventionists who committed heinous crimes on Korean territory. Belarusian Meritorious Physician Moskowa said: In our hearts, the word Geoje Island is associated with nothing but the inhuman suffering of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and the endless abuse inflicted upon them by American soldiers. In order to save tens of thousands of unarmed people, we demand today: Stop the bloody hands of the murderers!
    The working people of Berlin held a meeting, and Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic said: "We call on the people of the German Democratic Republic and all German patriots to unite more closely around the government under the banner of the National Front of Democratic Germany, and support the measures taken by the government to strengthen the German Democratic Republic. It is not enough to just talk now. Our struggle has entered a new stage. Actively defending peace with arms has been put on the agenda of the German Democratic Republic. The German people and German youth must understand the seriousness of the current situation, and must defend the German Democratic Republic with arms, protect our motherland, our great construction cause, and our democratic political system, in order to save our people from suffering the fate of Korea." The conference unanimously adopted a resolution angrily protesting the American imperialists' germ warfare and protesting the American military authorities' brutal persecution of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island.
    The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a letter to Truman. This letter condemned the massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island and demanded that the United Nations Security Council immediately investigate and punish those responsible for these atrocities. The Progressive Party of the United States published a letter from Benson, Chairman of the National Committee of the Party and former Governor of Minnesota, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations stop the crimes of the American aggressor troops in massacring prisoners in Korea.

    全世界人民谴责巨济岛血腥事件
    朝鲜祖国战线抗议美国屠杀我被俘人员
    【新华社十四日讯】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在十二日举行会议。会议在听取议长团议长之一——郑鲁植所作“关于美国侵略者虐杀我方被俘人员的暴行”的报告之后，进行了热烈的讨论。会议决定了反对与抗议美帝国主义虐杀我方被俘人员的暴行的斗争对策，并通过了痛斥与抗议美帝国主义暴行的声明。
    抗议声明说：美帝国主义在朝鲜所制造的罪恶暴行是没有止境的。美国侵略者已把收容着我方被俘人员的巨济岛变成了“死亡之岛”，在那里造成了和“麦丹尼克”、“奥斯威辛”一样的活地狱。美国侵略者在朝鲜所表现的残暴程度，超过了在纽伦堡受到应得惩罚的希特勒匪帮。
    声明指出：美帝国主义者屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行真相，已经再也掩盖不住了，它已经广泛地传播于全世界了。全朝鲜人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都在反对和严正抗议美国刽子手对于我方被俘人员的这种史无前例的血腥暴行。朝鲜人民绝对不能容忍美国野兽用我们人民的鲜血来染红我们美丽的土地，在我们的疆土上犯下丑恶的暴行。野兽们的罪责是逃脱不了的。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会代表各政党、社会团体和全朝鲜人民，以无比的愤怒和憎恨，严重抗议美国侵略者屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行，坚决要求美方立即停止这种暴行，并必须给予我方被俘人员以日内瓦公约及其他世界公认的国际公法所规定的合理的战俘待遇。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会坚决主张，必须依据国际公法，保障我方被俘人员的正当权利，反对所谓“自愿遣返”与强制“甄别”。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会向全世界爱好自由的人民呼吁，迅速制止美帝国主义在联合国旗帜下在朝鲜进行的侵略战争，并迫使它在停战后无条件地遣返战俘。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会确信，屠杀我方被俘人员和直接组织与执行这种暴行的美国战争罪犯们，必将在全世界善良人民的面前，受到裁判和应得的惩罚。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国侵略者在巨济岛上继续对朝中战俘进行血腥屠杀的暴行，更加引起了全世界人民的愤怒。在苏联、在德意志民主共和国、甚至在美国，人民都提出了坚决的抗议。
    千百万苏联人民一致要求制止美国侵略者屠杀巨济岛朝中战俘的暴行。白俄罗斯的维切布斯克城举行了全城大会，出席大会的人一致谴责在朝鲜领土上进行万恶罪行的美国干涉者。白俄罗斯功勋医师莫斯柯娃说：在我们心中，与巨济岛这个字联系在一起的，没有别的，只有朝中战俘所遭受的非人痛苦与美国军人所加于他们身上的漫无止境的虐待。为了要拯救成千成万赤手空拳的人民，我们今天要求：制止杀人犯的血手！
    柏林市劳动人民举行大会，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥说：“我们号召德意志民主共和国人民和一切德国爱国者，在民主德国全国阵线的旗帜下，更加紧密地团结在政府的周围，支持政府为了加强德意志民主共和国而采取的措施。现在仅仅说话已经不够了。我们的斗争已经进入了一个新的阶段。积极地以武装捍卫和平已经提到德意志民主共和国的日程上来了。德国人民和德国青年必须了解目前情势的严重性，必须以武装捍卫德意志民主共和国，保卫我们的祖国、我们的伟大建设事业和我们的民主政治制度，以挽救我国人民，使他们不致有朝鲜的命运。”大会一致通过决议，忿怒地抗议美帝国主义者进行细菌战，抗议美国军事当局残酷地迫害巨济岛朝、中两国战俘。
    美国共产党全国委员会发表了写给杜鲁门的信。这封信谴责对巨济岛上的战俘进行屠杀，并要求联合国安全理事会立即调查并惩办应对这些暴行负责的人。美国进步党发表该党全国委员会主席、前明尼苏达州州长宾逊写给联合国秘书处的信，这封信要求联合国制止美国侵略军在朝鲜屠杀俘虏的罪行。
