    My Suggestions for Locust Swarm Eradication Work

    Editor: Locust nymphs have already been discovered in many areas. To overcome the locust plague, we must first thoroughly eliminate the locust nymphs.

    To eliminate locust nymphs, the first thing is to be good at grasping the locust situation. Last year, some areas did not grasp the locust situation. Upon hearing of the appearance of locust nymphs, they mobilized too many people to catch and beat them. Although the locust nymphs were wiped out, we also paid too high a price. Because the hatching time of locust nymphs varies, it may last for as long as a month in the same area. Many places saw new nymphs emerge as soon as the old ones were beaten, and it was sometimes necessary to catch and beat them many times on the same ground. As a result, cadres and the masses were often exhausted, and the use of agents was inevitably wasteful.

    In order to avoid or reduce the waste of manpower and materials, the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Ministry of Agriculture have repeatedly called on the masses to carry out work such as inspecting eggs, inspecting nymphs, and monitoring the activities of locust nymphs, and to prepare in advance for the transportation and storage of pharmaceutical machinery and the organization of manpower. This is entirely correct and necessary. In addition, I also suggest:

    1. Seize favorable opportunities to wipe out locust nymphs. It is best to strike when most of the locust eggs have already hatched, the earliest hatched locust nymphs have grown to the third instar, but have not yet spread (the first batch of locust nymphs takes about fifteen to twenty days from hatching to the third instar), and the rest are still in the first and second instar stages, and wipe them out in one go. If locust eggs continue to hatch after this, wait until the largest hoppers have grown to the third instar and eliminate them all at once. In this period, manual beating or spraying with medicinal powder can have a greater effect. When spraying with medicinal powder, two and a half to three catties of "666" medicinal powder can be sprayed on each mu of land. This can not only eliminate all the locust nymphs that have emerged from the soil, but also kill the locust nymphs that continue to hatch out of the soil within three to five days after the powder is sprinkled when they come into contact with the remaining medicinal powder.

    2. After most of the locust nymphs have grown to the third instar, they will migrate in groups. At this time, it is also effective to use the migratory habits of locust nymphs, grasp their migration direction, and dig head-on trenches to trap and kill them. If the migration direction is not grasped correctly, and the trenches have been dug but the locusts do not enter, they can be led into the trenches by people. If there is water in the trenches, spraying some kerosene on the water surface will further increase the effectiveness of locust control.

    In farmland, locust nymphs should be eliminated with pharmaceutical machinery as soon as they appear. Even if they are beaten one or two more times on the same ground, it is not considered a waste. In barren land, roadsides, and gravesides not far from the village, if sporadic locust nymphs occur, artificial capture can be used to save agents.

### 我对扑灭蝗蝻工作的建议

    我对扑灭蝗蝻工作的建议
    编辑同志：目前许多地区已经发现蝗蝻。我们要战胜蝗灾，首先就要彻底消灭蝗蝻。
    要消灭蝗蝻，首先要善于掌握蝗情。去年有些地区没有掌握蝗情，听说蝗蝻出现，就发动过多的群众前往捕打；蝗蝻虽被扑灭，但我们也付出了过多的代价。因为蝗蝻孵化的时间参差不齐，在同一地区内可能延续一个月之久。不少地方随打随生，在同一地面上有时必须捕打许多次。这样，干部和群众常常疲劳不堪，施用药剂也不免浪费。
    为了避免或减少人力物力的浪费，中央人民政府政务院及中央农业部曾一再号召群众进行查卵、查蝻和监视蝗蝻活动等工作，并预先作好运储药械和组织人力等工作。这是完全正确和必要的。此外，我还建议：
    一、抓住有利时机扑灭蝗蝻。最好是在蝗卵大部已经孵化，最早孵化的蝗蝻已长到三龄，但尚未扩散（第一批蝗蝻从孵化到第三龄，约需十五天至二十天的时间），其余还在一、二龄的时期，一鼓将其扑灭。此后如果蝗卵继续孵化，可等到最大的跳蝻长到第三龄时，一次予以歼灭。在这种时期，用人力扑打或用药粉喷杀，都可发生较大效果。用药粉喷杀，每次可在每亩面积上喷射二斤半至三斤
    “六六六”药粉。这不仅可把已经出土的蝗蝻全部消灭，即在撒粉后三、五日内继续孵化出土的蝗蝻，碰到遗留的药粉也将被杀死。
    二、大部分蝗蝻长到三龄以后，就要成群迁移。这时，利用蝗蝻迁移习性，掌握其迁移方向，挖掘迎头沟陷杀，也很有效。如果迁移方向掌握不对，沟已掘好，而蝗虫不进去，则可用由人带领的方法，把它领进沟去。如果沟中有水，在水面上喷撒些煤油，就更可增加治蝗的功效。
    在庄稼地内，蝗蝻随时发生，即应随时使用药械把它消灭。即使在同一地面上多扑打一两次也不算浪费。在距离村庄不远的荒地、路边、坟边等处，如果发生零星蝗蝻，为了节省药剂，可用人工捕打。
