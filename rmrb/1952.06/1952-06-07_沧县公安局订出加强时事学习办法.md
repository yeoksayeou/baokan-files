    Cang County Public Security Bureau Establishes Measures to Strengthen Current Affairs Study

    Editor: I feel that the Cang County People's Government Public Security Bureau also has a serious situation of neglecting reading newspapers and studying. Most people emphasize that they are busy with work, have no time, and do not pay attention to reading newspapers. For example, Comrade Zhou Fengtong of our bureau said, "I am so busy with work, how can I have time to read newspapers!" Some comrades put study in opposition to work, believing that "it is enough to complete the work tasks, it doesn't matter whether you study or not." There are also a few individuals who regard current affairs and political study as a burden. They are listless and unable to listen during political classes; after class, they say, "We are liberated!"

    In order to correct the above shortcomings, our bureau has established a system to strengthen newspaper reading and study. The decision is: 1. Establish newspaper reading groups by section, and conduct one hour of newspaper reading study every day. 2. Increase the number of newspapers, reallocate them according to needs, and assign special personnel to manage them to prevent the confusion of loss and random taking. 3. Add a bulletin board, and regularly hold current affairs Q&A, quizzes, and discussions to promote everyone's newspaper reading and study. 4. Hold current affairs seminars for a certain amount of time every Sunday. These systems are still very imperfect, but we must respond to the call of the Party newspaper and persevere in reading newspapers and studying.

    沧县公安局订出加强时事学习办法
    编辑同志：我感到沧县人民政府公安局也有忽视读报学习的严重情况。大部分人强调业务繁忙，没有时间，不注意看报。如我局周凤桐同志说：“工作这么忙，那有时间看报呀！”一部分同志把学习和工作对立起来，认为“完成了工作任务就行，学习不学习没关系。”还有个别人把时事和政治学习看成是负担。他们在上政治课的时候，没精打采，听不下去；下课以后就说：“可解放啦！”
    为了纠正上述缺点，我局已订出了加强读报学习的制度。决定：一，以股为单位建立读报组，每天进行一小时的读报学习。二，增加报纸的份数，按照需要重新分配，并交专人保管，防止丢失和乱拿的混乱现象。三，增添壁报栏，经常举行时事问答、测验和讨论等，以推动大家的读报学习。四，每星期日以一定的时间举行时事座谈。这些制度都还很不健全，但是我们一定要响应党报的号召，把读报学习坚持下去。                　孙庆献
