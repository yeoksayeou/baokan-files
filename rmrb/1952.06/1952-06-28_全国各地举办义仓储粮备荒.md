Since the nationwide liberation, various regions have universally reorganized the old mass-based grain storage organizations for famine prevention – the community granaries (义仓). Many regions have also established new community granaries. These granaries have played a significant role in supporting disaster areas and helping disaster victims through difficult times. The relevant leading organs in the Northeast and Northwest regions have paid more attention to this work and started the reorganization and establishment of community granaries earlier. Many regions have established new community granaries, which have become an important force in supporting disaster victims through difficult times. From 1948 to 1951, Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces accumulated over 30 million jin of grain in community granaries. Songjiang Province estimates that it can accumulate about 10 million jin of community grain annually in the future. In the Northwest region, Weinan, Xianyang, Yulin, and Suide in Shaanxi Province have all established community granaries. Gansu Province has about 10 million jin of community grain. The community grain in these areas has not only solved the difficulties faced by disaster victims during difficult times but has also supported production. Although Songjiang Province suffered from floods last year, it did not require government allocation of grain for relief. Some farmers in Heilongjiang Province largely rely on community grain to overcome difficulties during the lean season. The 300,000+ jin of community grain in the suburbs of Xi'an City solved the living and production problems of more than 22,000 of the most destitute disaster victims during the spring famine. Shandong, Fujian, and northern Jiangsu in the East China region are all piloting and gradually promoting community granaries. In the autumn of 1950, the Changwei Special District of Shandong Province focused on piloting community granaries in the six counties under its jurisdiction. Because the propaganda and education work was well done, and the community granary grain was lent out in a timely manner during the spring famine, the masses generally reflected that "establishing community granaries is a good thing" and that "the People's Government is thinking about the people everywhere." Therefore, after the wheat harvest, the masses were very enthusiastic about handing over community grain. In addition, the Central South and Southwest provinces have also cleaned up the old community grain, and individual regions are also piloting new community granaries.

Regarding the source of community grain, most areas adopt fundraising methods. Generally, various regions conduct fundraising after the harvest of major agricultural products (except in famine years), and the quantity generally does not exceed 1% to 3% of the public grain to be levied. In terms of grain use, most areas follow the principle of "storing grain for famine relief," storing grain in good years and using it in famine years (lending it out at low or no interest, or providing relief) to support disaster victims through difficult times and to support production. The phenomenon of misuse of community grain has occurred in some areas, which should be corrected in a timely manner. In terms of grain storage, generally, at the beginning of the establishment of community granaries, mass granaries are mostly borrowed. After the work has a certain foundation, permanent warehouses are then established. In terms of organizational leadership, most areas organize a community granary management committee to be responsible for management. The community granary management committee is composed of representatives elected by the masses and representatives of relevant government departments.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government recently issued a "Notice on Promoting Civilian Savings and Storing Grain for Famine Prevention," calling on various regions to promote civilian savings and storing grain for famine prevention in future disaster prevention and relief work, and requiring people's governments at all levels to strengthen leadership over community granary work.

    全国各地举办义仓储粮备荒
    全国解放以来，各地对民间旧有的群众性的积谷防荒组织——义仓，普遍进行了整理，有许多地区并建立了新义仓。这些义仓在支持灾区灾民生产度荒上，发挥了显著作用。东北区和西北区各有关领导机关，对这一工作比较重视，整理和建立义仓的工作开始较早，不少地区建立了新的义仓，成为支持灾民度荒的重要力量。松江、黑龙江两省从一九四八年到一九五一年，已积义仓粮三千万斤以上。松江省估计今后每年约可积义粮一千万斤。西北区陕西省渭南、咸阳、榆林、绥德等地都建立了义仓。甘肃省约有义仓粮一千万斤。这些地区的义仓粮不但解决了灾民度荒中的困难，而且支持了生产。松江省去年虽有水灾，但不需政府拨粮救济；黑龙江省的某些农民在青黄不接时，大部靠义仓粮解决困难。西安市郊区三十余万斤义仓粮，解决了春荒时期二万二千多名最困难的灾民的生活和生产问题。华东区的山东、福建、苏北等地都在重点试办和逐步推广义仓。山东省昌潍专区一九五○年秋在所辖六县重点试办义仓，由于宣传教育工作做得好，并在春荒时期及时借出义仓粮，群众普遍反映“办义仓是好事”，“人民政府处处为人民着想”。因此，麦季后群众交义仓粮的情绪很高。此外，中南、西南各省对旧有义仓粮也都进行了清理，个别地区并在试办新义仓。
    在义仓粮的来源上，大部地区是采取募集方式。各地一般都是在主要农产物收获后进行募集（荒歉年除外），数量一般都不超过应征公粮的百分之一至百分之三。在粮食使用上，大都按照“储粮备荒”的原则，丰年储蓄，荒年使用（低利、无利借出，或者救济），支持灾民度荒和生产。部分地区曾经发生滥用义仓粮的现象，这是应当及时纠正的。在粮食保管上，一般在开始举办义仓时，多借用群众粮仓，待工作有了一定基础后，再建立永久的仓库。在组织领导上，大部地区是组织义仓管理委员会负责管理。义仓管理委员会由群众选举的代表和政府有关部门的代表共同组成。
    中央人民政府内务部最近曾发出“关于提倡民间节约储蓄、积谷防荒的通知”，号召各地在今后防 灾、救灾工作中，提倡民间节约储蓄、积谷防荒，并要求各级人民政府加强对义仓工作的领导。
