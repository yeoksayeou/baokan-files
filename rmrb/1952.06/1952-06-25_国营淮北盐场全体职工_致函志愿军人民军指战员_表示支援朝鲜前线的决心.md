A Letter from the Entire Staff of the State-Owned HuaiBei Saltworks to the Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, Expressing Their Determination to Support the Korean Front

Dear Comrades of the Entire Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army:

June 25th is the second anniversary of the Korean Anti-Aggression War and International Day of Action in Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace. On this great day, we extend our highest revolutionary salute to you!

Dear comrades, for two years, you have created countless heroic deeds on the forefront of defending world peace. These deeds inspire the hearts of each of us, making everyone more enthusiastically involved in production and construction, and supporting you with practical actions. In the winter of 1950, we laid a solid foundation for the patriotic production competition in the spring of the following year. Therefore, in 1951, the total output of the spring and autumn seasons exceeded the planned production task by 47.25 percent, surpassing the average output before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 41 percent, setting a new record in sixteen years. This year, everyone is even more motivated, and the planned annual production target is 27 percent higher than last year, increasing the country's wealth by 25 billion yuan through increased production and thrift. Comrades, if these 25 billion yuan are used for resisting America and aiding Korea, they can purchase seventeen fighter planes, which our air force heroes can fly and will surely bring us more good news! From the end of March, more than 10,000 workers in our factory have been involved in this hot production competition. By June 15th, we had completed one-half of the annual production plan. During the campaign, we also promoted the advanced experience of the Shi Baoyu team's collective production method. This advanced production experience is one of the major creations of our factory in last year's production competition. It not only determines the improvement of labor productivity and the reduction of costs, but also paves the way for the gradual transition of our salt production from decentralization to centralization.

In last year's increased production and donation campaign, the entire staff donated more than 2.1 billion yuan, overfulfilling the plan for a "HuaiBei Saltworks" fighter plane. At the same time, respecting and loving the families of martyrs and soldiers has become a social trend throughout the factory. Last year alone, we donated more than 16,000 kilograms of grain to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and organized慰问 teams to send them honorary plaques and gifts, and often helped them solve difficulties.

Dear comrades, on this great day, let us once again express our firm determination to you: We will act more urgently, exert greater labor enthusiasm, and continuously tap potential and find tricks to strive to complete this year's increased production and thrift plan ahead of schedule, to fully support you. At the same time, we must deeply carry out the patriotic anti-epidemic and health campaign to crush the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism!

The Entire Staff of the State-Owned HuaiBei Saltworks

    国营淮北盐场全体职工
    致函志愿军人民军指战员  表示支援朝鲜前线的决心亲爱的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军全体指战员同志们：
    六月二十五日是朝鲜反侵略战争两周年纪念日，又是国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日。我们谨在此伟大的日子里，向你们致以最崇高的革命敬礼！
    亲爱的同志们，两年来，你们在保卫世界和平的最前线上创造了无数的可歌可泣的英勇事迹，这些事迹鼓舞着我们每一个人的心，使大家更热烈地投入生产建设，以实际行动来支援你们。一九五○年冬季，我们就打好了次年春季爱国生产竞赛的基础，因此一九五一年全场春、秋季产量就超过了预计生产任务百分之四十七点二五，超过了抗日战争前平均产量的百分之四十一，创十六年来的新纪录。今年，大家的劲头更大，预定全年的生产计划比去年提高百分之二十七，为国家增产节约二百五十亿元的财富。同志们，这二百五十亿元，若用于抗美援朝，可购买十七架战斗机，让咱们的空军英雄们驾驶起来，一定将给我们送来更多的胜利消息！从三月底，我们全场的一万多工人即投入了这一热火朝天的生产竞赛运动。到六月十五日，我们已完成了全年生产计划的二分之一。在运动中，我们并推广了时宝玉小组集体生产方式的先进经验。这一先进生产经验是我场在去年的生产竞赛中的重大创造之一，它不但决定着劳动生产效率的提高与成本的降低，而且给我们盐场生产由分散逐步走向集中开辟了道路。
    在去年的增产捐献运动中，全场职工共捐献人民币二十一亿余元，超额完成了一架“淮北盐场号”战斗机的计划。同时，尊敬和热爱烈、军属在全场已形成了社会风气。光去年我们就给烈、军属捐献了一万六千余斤粮食，并组织了慰问队，给他们送光荣匾、礼物，也经常帮助他们解决困难。
    亲爱的同志们，让我们在这伟大的日子里，再一次向你们表示我们的坚强决心：我们将更紧张地行动起来，发挥更高度的劳动积极性，不断地挖潜力、找窍门，争取提前完成今年的增产节约计划，以全力支持你们。同时我们要深入地开展爱国防疫卫生运动，以粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战！
