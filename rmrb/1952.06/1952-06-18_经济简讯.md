Economic Briefs

    ▲ The Qu Yaoli mutual aid team, which launched a cotton field bumper harvest competition among cotton farmers nationwide, has very good cotton seedling growth this spring. The whole team's cotton seedlings are as high as six inches, and the seedlings are strong, exceeding the average cotton seedlings in southern Shanxi by about one inch. After four seedling thinnings, the group retained about 3,000 seedlings per mu. Qu Yaoli and deputy leader Gao Jindong's high-yield plots retained more than 3,500 seedlings per mu.

    ▲ Sugarcane farmers in the Tuo River basin of southern Sichuan are enthusiastically launching a patriotic bumper harvest competition. The planned output for more than 300,000 mu of sugarcane fields in the region is 39.03% higher than in 1951. When spring sugarcane was planted this year, Fang Pufu, a sugarcane planting expert from Zizhong County, achieved a yield of 9,400 kilograms per mu last year. This year, he challenged sugarcane farmers in southern Sichuan with a target of 15,000 kilograms per mu. Subsequently, the Neijiang Sugarcane Experimental Farm, farms in Zizhong and other counties, and many mutual aid teams and high-yield households on both banks of the Tuo River responded to the challenge, forming a chain reaction of competitions. Huang Wanfa, a sugarcane farmer from Yingshan Town, Zizhong County, achieved a yield of 8,500 kilograms per mu last year, exceeding the local average yield by two and a half times. This year, when he participated in the competition, he carefully calculated the costs and guaranteed a sugarcane yield of 12,000 kilograms per mu.

    ▲ Liling County, Hunan Province, has made great achievements in summer fertilizer accumulation. By early June, the county had increased potash fertilizer by more than 1.25 million dan, meeting the requirements for two topdressings of fertilizer for the county's 630,000 mu of paddy fields.

    ▲ The rivers in the Central South region have entered a tense flood season. In the two months since the beginning of the flood season, all major rivers in the Central South region, except for the Yangtze River, have experienced major flood peaks. However, under the leadership of the local people's governments, the broad masses of the people worked hard to protect against floods, and many leading cadres personally went to the embankments to take the lead in rescue work, and finally saved many dangers. Now the flood reporting work of all rivers has been strengthened, and the rescue technology has also been improved. However, there are still many shortcomings in the flood control work in the Central South region. Many cadres and people still have complacency; some projects cannot withstand the test of floods. The Central South Flood Control Headquarters has issued an emergency flood control instruction, requiring flood control institutions in all provinces and cities to strengthen flood control.

    ▲川南沱江流域的产糖区蔗农，正热烈展开爱国丰产竞赛。全区三十多万亩蔗田的丰产计划比一九五一年提高百分之三十九点零三。今年春蔗下种时，资中县种蔗能手方普福，去年每亩产量已经达到九千四百公斤，他今年以每亩产一万五千公斤向川南蔗农挑战。接着，内江甘蔗试验场及资中等县的农场和沱江两岸的许多互助组、丰产户等便纷起应战，形成连环竞赛的热潮。资中县营山镇蔗农黄万发，去年每亩产量达八千五百公斤，超过当地平均产量两倍半；今年他参加竞赛时，算了细账，保证每亩产蔗一万二千公斤。
    ▲湖南省醴陵县夏季积肥取得很大成绩。六月初，该县已增加钾肥一百二十五万多担，达到全县六十三万亩水田追肥两次的要求。
    ▲中南区各河流进入紧张汛期，汛期开始两月来，中南区各主要河流，除长江外，都曾发现较大的洪峰。但各地人民政府领导广大人民努力防护，许多领导机关的干部都亲自上堤，带头抢险，终于挽救了不少的危难。现在各河报汛工作已有加强，抢险技术也都提高了。但是，中南区的防汛工作仍存在不少缺点。不少干部和群众中尚有麻痹思想；有些工程还经不起洪水的考验。中南区防汛总指挥部特发出紧急防汛指示，要求各省、市防汛机构加强防汛。
