    Protest Against the Illegal Arrest of Duclos and Other Peace Fighters by the French Pinay Government
    The French Pinay government has, on trumped-up charges, illegally arrested the leader of the French people, Duclos, and other peace fighters. We, the entire membership of the Central Ministry of Labour's Trade Union, express our solemn protest and condemnation of this vile crime by the French Pinay government! We believe that the French reactionary Pinay government's terroristic suppression of the patriotic French people is clearly inseparable from the aggressive schemes of its master, American imperialism. We, the entire membership of the Central Ministry of Labour's Trade Union, assure the peace-loving people of the world that we will do everything in our power to support the struggle of the French people, and are determined to do a good job in the increase production and practice economy movement, and to strike back at the reactionary camp headed by American imperialism through practical actions to strengthen the resistance against American aggression and aid Korea.
    Central Ministry of Labour's Trade Union

    抗议法国比内政府非法逮捕杜克洛及其他和平战士
    法国比内政府竟以莫须有的罪名，非法逮捕法国人民领袖杜克洛及其他和平战士们。我们中央劳动部机关工会全体会员对法国比内政府这种丑恶罪行提出严正的抗议和声讨！我们认为法国的反动比内政府对于法国爱国人民的恐怖镇压，显然是和它的主子美帝国主义的侵略阴谋分不开的。我们中央劳动部机关工会全体会员们，向全世界爱好和平的人民保证，尽一切力量支援法国人民的斗争，决心搞好增产节约运动，从加强抗美援朝的实际行动中来回击以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营。
    中央劳动部机关工会
