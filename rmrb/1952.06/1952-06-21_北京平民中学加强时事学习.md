    Beijing Pingmin Middle School Strengthens Current Affairs Study

    Editor: The letter to the editor titled "The Effectiveness of Current Affairs Study for Students in Beijing Middle Schools is Very Poor," published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on May 17th, criticized the phenomenon of Pingmin Middle School neglecting current affairs study. This criticism is correct. The school's administrative leadership, during this semester, never studied how to lead students in current affairs study, and no current affairs reports were given. Due to the lack of leadership, some existing current affairs study systems were left to develop on their own. Although the students listened to current affairs broadcasts every day as usual, they did not achieve the desired results. This serious tendency to neglect politics did not attract our attention until the People's Daily published the criticism, giving us a warning, and we then realized the seriousness of the problem.

    In order to correct the above serious errors, we have specifically studied and established a system for current affairs study based on the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education: 1. Give a current affairs report once a week; 2. Increase the reading time by half an hour every day; 3. Seriously implement the systems for listening to broadcasts and current affairs quizzes. These methods have been implemented for more than a month, and the students' enthusiasm for current affairs study has generally increased. The results of the May current affairs quiz showed significant improvement compared to March and April. For example, only seven students in the three senior high school classes failed, and the average score of each class in the whole school did not have any failures. The number of newspapers ordered has also increased considerably.

    There are still many shortcomings in our school's current affairs study. For example, the current affairs study for faculty and staff still lacks necessary systems. In the future, we must earnestly respond to the call of the Party newspaper and do a good job in the current affairs study of all teachers and students in the school.

### 北京平民中学加强时事学习

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京平民中学加强时事学习
    编辑同志：五月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的题为“北京市中等学校学生时事学习的效果很差”的来信综述，对平民中学忽视时事学习的现象，提出了批评。这个批评是正确的。我校行政领导方面，在本学期从没有研究过怎样领导同学们的时事学习问题，时事报告一次也没有作。由于缺乏领导，使某些已有的时事学习制度都陷于自流了。同学们虽然每天照例地听时事广播，但是没有收到应有的效果。这种严重地忽视政治的倾向，一直没有引起我们的注意，直到人民日报提出了批评，给我们敲了警钟，我们才认识了这个问题的严重性。
    为了纠正上述严重的错误，我们根据北京市文教局的指示，具体地研究和订立了时事学习制度：一，每周作一次时事报告；二，每日增加半小时的读报时间；三，认真执行收听广播和时事测验等制度。这些办法已经实行了一个多月，同学们的时事学习热情普遍提高。五月份的时事测验成绩，比三四月份已有显著的进步。如：高中三个班只有七人不及格，全校各班平均分数没有不及格的。报纸份数也增加了不少。
    我校时事学习还存在着很多缺点，例如，教职员的时事学习还缺乏必要的制度。今后我们一定要切实地响应党报的号召，把全校师生的时事学习搞好。
