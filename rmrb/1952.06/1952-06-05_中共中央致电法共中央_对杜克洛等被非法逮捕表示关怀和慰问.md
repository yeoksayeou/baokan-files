    CCP Central Committee Sends Telegram to French Communist Party Central Committee
    Expressing Concern and Sympathy for the Illegal Arrests of Duclos and Others [This newspaper dispatch] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, expressing concern and sympathy for the illegal arrests of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, "l'Humanité" Editor-in-Chief Stieglitz, and other French patriots. The telegram reads as follows: To the Central Committee of the French Communist Party in Paris, dear comrades!
    We express our deep brotherly concern and sympathy for the illegal arrests of Comrade Duclos, the Secretary of the French Communist Party and an outstanding son of the French people, Comrade Stieglitz, the Editor-in-Chief of "l'Humanité," and other French patriots for opposing the war plans of the American aggressors! This is an atrocity planned and directed by the American aggressors to undermine the peace cause of the French working class and the French people. The Chinese people are extremely indignant at this atrocity!
    The French people's struggle against American war plans, for independence, and to defend peace is heroic and just, and the Chinese people are willing to give it enthusiastic support. We believe that this struggle of the French people, with the support of the powerful world peace and democracy forces, will surely be victorious! We wish you success in this struggle!
               The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
              Beijing, June 3, 1952
