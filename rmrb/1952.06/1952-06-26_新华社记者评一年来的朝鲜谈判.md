Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 24th: Our special correspondent reports: The Korean people's war against American aggression has now lasted two years. Only one step remains to achieve an armistice in Korea. However, due to Washington's orders to its negotiating representatives in Panmunjom to refuse to take this final step, the Korean War continues to this day. The last step that the American negotiating representatives are unwilling to take is simply to "let the prisoners of war go home to live a peaceful life."

The U.S. imperialists' act of aggression against Korea two years ago was the first step in a plan to force all of Asia to kneel before American power. However, contrary to Washington's war plans, the myth of American superiority was shattered on the Korean battlefield and buried at the negotiating table in Panmunjom.

It took the Pentagon more than a year to understand that they could not defeat the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the battlefield, and therefore had to come to the negotiating table to seek a respite from heavy military blows. It took them another year to understand that they could not get at the conference table what they could not get on the battlefield.

At the negotiating table, the mask of the "United Nations" was torn off, exposing who was manipulating the whole charade. American generals intimidated their vassal states, preventing them from uttering a sound. They controlled the negotiations to suit Washington's war policy. The only say their allies had was to risk their lives on the front lines for the American generals while the American generals obstructed the realization of the Korean armistice. Their only right was to be dragged deeper into the quagmire created by the United States.

Despite repeated failures on the battlefield, American generals still attempted to act like victors at the conference table, deceiving the world. Their so-called "honorable armistice" was to write into the armistice agreement precedents that would facilitate continued aggression throughout the world, in order to compensate for the failures the United States suffered on the battlefield. However, they failed miserably and became infamous throughout the world.

The eleven and a half months of negotiations have been a record of American bluffing, intimidation, playing rogue tactics, creating bombing and strafing incidents, maliciously violating solemn agreements, interrupting negotiations, launching military offensives, and using poison gas, napalm, and even bacteriological weapons against the representatives of the liberated Asian people, but constantly being defeated. During this period, the representatives of the liberated Asian people waged a resolute and unyielding struggle to achieve a fair and reasonable Korean armistice.

Ridgway interrupted the negotiations for more than two months, and after the negotiations resumed, he engaged in another month of bluffing and threats, attempting to push the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone deep into the positions of North Korea. He failed and had to accept the fair and reasonable principle of determining the military demarcation line based on the line of contact between the two sides. The American attempt to seize territory by using the excuse of "air and naval superiority" was defeated. The American attitude of showing off its power at the negotiating table was thwarted for the first time in Asia.

The second attempt by the U.S. side was to demand interference in internal affairs—to demand permission for aerial and photographic reconnaissance by the belligerent parties, free movement and inspection in the rear, and restrictions on air force equipment. For this purpose, the American negotiating representatives strangled all hope of achieving an armistice within the thirty-day deadline last December and dragged the negotiations on for another six months. They had to abandon their last demand to interfere in internal affairs—restricting the construction of airfields—at the end of April. The American attempt to write clauses of interference in internal affairs into the armistice agreement failed.

As early as April, the draft armistice agreement was ready for signature, but the American negotiating representatives kicked aside the Geneva Convention and the recognized rules of war and demanded the forced retention of 100,000 prisoners of war, thereby breaking the hope of an armistice once again. The more prisoners of war they detained, the more they used the lives, blood, and suffering of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to extort political concessions from us.

The only issue hindering the Korean armistice—the issue of the release and repatriation of prisoners of war—has become a world issue. Everyone in every country is facing the American challenge—should the Geneva Convention be rewritten to deprive prisoners of war of the right to be repatriated home? After the killings and bloodshed on Koje Island, should the method of "voluntary repatriation" be used to facilitate the "screening" of all prisoners of war? The Koje Island death camp has shown the world that "voluntary repatriation" is entirely a gateway to detaining prisoners of war through atrocities, torture, forced tattooing, forced fingerprints, murder, and bloodshed. "Voluntary repatriation" is a signal to those who hold prisoners of war, telling them to compete with each other to detain prisoners of war at will, according to the Koje Island method. "Voluntary repatriation" means that a prisoner of war who is unfortunately captured, no matter what country he is from, must forever give up the right to return to his hometown and live a peaceful life with his family under the compulsion of bayonets.

How long it will take for Washington to realize that it should not issue ultimatums at the negotiating table for the sake of detaining prisoners of war remains to be seen. However, authoritative sources here are certain that the American attempt to write the principle of "voluntary repatriation" into the armistice agreement, thereby legalizing the detention of prisoners of war, will never succeed. Washington should recognize the new historical reality of Asia: the liberated people of two Asian countries have proven to be unmatched by the armies of seventeen countries—including the most elite American divisions on the battlefield. This simply explains why whatever the American generals cannot get on the battlefield, they cannot get at the conference table. This is a decisive fact. This is an irrefutable truth. If the U.S. side refuses to recognize this fact and truth, it will surely fail in the end.

### 新华社记者评一年来的朝鲜谈判

    新华社记者评一年来的朝鲜谈判
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜人民抗美战争到今天已经两年了。现在只差一步，就可以在朝鲜实现停战。但由于华盛顿命令它在板门店的谈判代表拒绝再走一步，朝鲜战争到今天仍在继续进行中。美方谈判代表所不肯走的这最后一步，其实只是“让战俘回家过和平生活”。
    美帝国主义在两年前侵略朝鲜的行为乃是企图迫使全亚洲在美国威力面前屈膝的计划的第一步。但是，与华盛顿的战争计划相反，美国的优势力量的神话在朝鲜战场陷于破产，在板门店谈判桌上遭到了埋葬。
    五角大楼花了一年多时间才懂得他们在战场无法战胜朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，因而不得不到谈判桌上来争取一个可以免受沉重军事打击的喘息时间。他们又花了一年时间才懂得他们无法在会议桌上得到他们在战场上所无法得到的东西。
    在谈判桌上，“联合国”的假面具脱落下来，暴露出谁在操纵整个把戏。美国将军威吓他们的附庸国使它们不敢作一声。他们把持谈判，以适合华盛顿的战争政策。他们的盟友的唯一发言权就是在美国将军阻挠朝鲜停战实现的时候，在前线上为美国将军卖命。他们的唯一权利就是被更深地拖入美国制造的泥淖中。
    尽管在战场上迭遭失败，美国将军仍然企图在会议桌上以胜利者自居，以欺蒙全世界。他们所谓的“光荣的停战”，就是在停战协定中写下便于继续侵略全世界的先例，以弥补美国在战场上遭到的失败。但是，他们悲惨地失败了，并且在全世界弄得声名狼籍。
    十一个半月的谈判就是美国虚张声势，虚声恫吓，玩弄流氓手段，制造轰炸和扫射事件，恶意违犯庄严协议，中断谈判，发动军事攻势，对解放了的亚洲人民的代表使用毒气、凝固汽油弹、甚至细菌武器，但又不断遭到失败的记录。在这一期间，解放了的亚洲人民的代表进行了坚决的不屈不挠的斗争，争取公平合理的朝鲜停战。
    李奇微曾经把谈判中断了两个多月，而在谈判恢复之后，又进行了一个月的虚声恫吓和威胁，妄想使军事分界线和非军事区深入朝鲜北部的阵地。他遭到了失败，不得不接受根据双方战斗接触线确定军事分界线的公平合理的原则。美方这种借口“空海军优势”攫夺领土的企图遭到了失败。美国在谈判桌上耀武扬威的态度第一次在亚洲碰了壁。
    美方第二个企图是要求干涉内政——要求准许交战方面进行空中和摄影侦察，在后方自由活动和视察，并对空军设备加以限制。为了这个目的，美国谈判代表在去年十二月扼杀了在三十天期限内实现停战的一切希望，又把谈判拖长了六个月。他们在四月底不得不放弃他们妄想干涉内政——限制修筑机场——的最后要求。美方想在停战协定里写下干涉内政的条款的企图是失败了。
    早在四月间停战草案就已拟好等着签字了，但是美方谈判代表一脚踢开日内瓦公约和公认的战争规则，竟要求强迫扣留十万战俘，从而再度打破了停战的希望。他们拘留的战俘比较多，他们就用朝中战俘的生命、鲜血和痛苦向我们勒索政治上的让步。
    阻碍朝鲜停战的唯一问题——释放和遣返战俘的问题，已经变成一个世界问题。每个国家的每个人都面对着美国的挑战——难道要改写日内瓦公约以便剥夺战俘被遣返回家的权利吗？在巨济岛的屠杀和流血的事件以后，难道还要通过“自愿遣返”的办法，为“甄别”全体战俘大开方便之门吗？巨济岛死亡营已向全世界表明了：“自愿遣返”完全是通过暴行、酷刑、强迫刺字、强捺指印、杀人和流血的办法扣留战俘的一个门径。“自愿遣返”对拘禁战俘的人是一个信号，叫他们按照巨济岛的办法，一个个争前恐后地恣意扣留战俘。“自愿遣返”意味着：不幸被俘的战俘，不论他是那国人，都得在刺刀尖的逼迫下，永远放弃回到他的家乡与他的家人同过和平生活的权利。
    究竟华盛顿需要多久的时间才会觉悟到它不应为了扣留战俘而在谈判会议的席上发出最后通牒，还要待以后才可以看出。但是美国想把“自愿遣返”的原则写在停战协定里，借此使得扣留战俘成为合法化的企图的永远不会成功，却是这里权威人士的肯定的意见。华盛顿应该认清亚洲的新的历史现实：两个亚洲国家的解放了的人民，已经证明不是十七个国家的军队——包括战场上的最精锐的美军各师——所能匹敌的。这简单地说明了为什么凡是美国的将军们在战场上所不能得到的，在会议桌上也不能得到。这是一种决定性的事实。这是颠扑不破的真理。美方如果不肯承认这种事实和真理，他就一定要失败到底。
