    Chen Youtang, a Foundry Worker at Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Factory No. 2, Bravely Rescues a Turbine
    Comrade Editor: Chen Youtang, a foundry worker at Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Factory No. 2, bravely rescued a turbine. One day, workers in the foundry were opening the furnace to cast a turbine. The crane poured the molten copper into the sand mold. Because it was poured too forcefully, the molten copper "shot" out of the seams of the sand mold. The scorching hot copper (1200 degrees Celsius) splashed onto the workers standing around pulling the crane, those holding the hooks, and those pouring the sand mold. Chen Youtang's feet were both burned by the molten copper. He thought about the fact that a turbine was worth more than 40 million yuan, and that the turbine was a key component of the winch for the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion gate. At that moment, he forgot the pain, picked up a shovel, and shoveled several shovels of sand one after another, pressing down on the seams of the mold from which the copper was "shooting." Then he turned around and poured the remaining molten copper from the crane into the sand mold. The turbine was finally saved. Everyone expressed their concern for him, and he replied with a smile, "I am a Communist Party member, this is what I should do." Yang Zhaoming

    江汉船舶机械二厂翻砂工人
    陈幼堂奋不顾身抢救窝轮
    编辑同志：江汉船舶机械二厂翻砂工人陈幼堂奋不顾身抢救了窝轮。有一天，翻砂间工人开炉翻铸窝轮。吊车把铜水浇到砂箱里去。因为浇得太猛，铜水从砂箱缝里“镖”出来。灼热的铜水（摄氏一千二百度）溅到站在四围的拉吊车工人、拿钩子的工人和浇砂箱的工人身上。陈幼堂双脚都被铜水烫伤了。他想到一个窝轮价值四千多万元，又想到窝轮是荆江分洪进洪闸门绞车上的主要机件，这时候，他忘了疼痛，拿起一把锹，接二连三地铲了几铲砂子，把“镖”出铜水的箱缝压住；又翻过身来，把吊车上剩下来的铜水浇进了砂箱。窝轮终于被保住了。大家向他慰问，他含笑回答：“我是一个共产党员，这是我应该做的事。”杨照明
