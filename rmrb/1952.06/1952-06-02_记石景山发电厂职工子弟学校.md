    A Record of the Shijingshan Power Plant Employee Children's School
    Shi Meimei

    Recently, I visited the Shijingshan Power Plant Employee Children's School. The school buildings here are all newly built, located on a small hillside in Shijingshan. When I went to visit, it was right after the second class in the morning. The hillside sparkled with the red scarves of the children, and light laughter rippled through the air. A large group of children surrounded me, shook my hand, saluted me, and asked me where I came from. When I answered "from the city," the children cheered, "Another new teacher has come!" They ushered me into the principal's office as if welcoming a guest.

    Principal Kou Luanpeng has been working here for ten years. He and several other young female teachers accompanied me on a tour of the entire school and gave me a detailed introduction to everything about the school.

    Before liberation, there were only three dilapidated temple rooms here, low, dark, and once collapsed in 1948. Children from several different classes were crowded together, noisy and boisterous, listening to the lesson. Four people shared a set of desks and chairs, taking turns sitting at the desk to write; many children had to lie on the threshold, window sill, or podium to write and read. There was no playground or toys, and it was out of the question to have books and instruments. Besides attending classes, the children had no extracurricular activities. As soon as school was over, they had to go home to work: some went back to help their fathers dig air-raid shelters, repair roads, and build碉堡 [blockhouses], some went to the river beach to pick up coal cinders, or helped their mothers take care of their younger siblings... The children wore patched clothes all year round, and they were not well fed. There was not a trace of joy or hope in their young minds. When the children grew up a little and had labor power, they had to drop out of school to become apprentices or go down to the coal mines in order to make a living. Therefore, the higher the grade, the fewer the number of students. It was rare to be able to graduate from elementary school.

    Now, the face of the school has completely changed. The People's Government is so concerned about the education of workers' children that it has spent more than 465 million yuan for the school in less than a year, building eight new school buildings. The number of students has increased from more than 100 to more than 460; the number of teachers has increased from five to thirteen. All the equipment in the school has been expanded and improved. The newly built classrooms are spacious and bright, and each child has a clean and comfortable set of desks and chairs. On the playground, there are slides, seesaws, swings, parallel bars, hanging boxes, and other sports equipment. The library has a collection of more than 100 children's books and picture magazines, reference books for teachers, more than 100 kinds of natural science instrument specimens, and more than 20 sets of wall charts. The club has organized singing teams, dance groups, waist drum teams, and radio listening groups, and also displays various toys and musical instruments. In their spare time, children can exercise on the playground, read in the library, and play in the club, enjoying their rest and activities.

    The factory's administrative leaders and the trade union often give the primary school various kinds of help, such as the factory clinic regularly conducting health check-ups for the children; the trade union holding movie evenings every Saturday, providing free admission to the children; and sometimes specially screening movies that children love, such as "Zoya," "Red Scarves," "Little Navy," "Happy Childhood," "Son of the League," etc. The factory often lends large trucks to the school, allowing the children to visit Beijing urban areas and learn practical knowledge.

    Children who had dropped out of school in the past due to difficult living conditions have also returned one after another. In order to facilitate teaching and help them learn better, the school, after several repeated studies, has organized a remedial class separately, allowing seventeen- and eighteen-year-old children to study at the school. The teaching speed is faster than that of ordinary classes, and the content is also richer. Because the children have suffered the pain of dropping out of school in the past, they are actively studying and striving to reach the level of elementary school graduation in a short period of time. Principal Kou said well: "The scars that the old society brought to the children will soon be healed under the nurturing of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!"

    The students' family life is also very good. Generally, they can eat fine grains and wear new uniforms. The factory has built many beautiful workers' dormitories. To the east of the primary school is the brand-new "Defend Peace" dormitory, and to the south is the red "Labor Model" building. The equipment in the houses is very good. Each family has a bedroom, kitchen, and courtyard. There is plenty of sunlight and air, and the sanitary conditions have also improved. Children grow up in such a new family environment, and their physical health is getting better and better. They rarely get sick, and the student attendance rate almost always remains at 100%.

    I visited the family of Liu Dezhen, a national labor model. He has three children. The eldest daughter, Liu Huiyin, is ten years old and is a third-grade student in elementary school; the second daughter, Liu Huilan, is five years old; and the youngest son, Liu Jianguo, is still breastfeeding. Liu Dezhen's monthly salary is more than 700 catties of rice, which is almost double what it was at the beginning of liberation. The children live very well. The older children can eat an average of two taels of meat and one egg every day. Their mother often makes noodles, pancakes, pot stickers, dumplings, buns, etc. for them, changing the variety. Their father often goes to the cooperative to buy them apples, pears, and biscuits. Last year, the whole family made new single clothes, lined clothes,绒衣 [fleece clothing], and cotton clothes. Even the youngest, Jianguo, who was only four months old, had more than forty feet of printed fabric bought for him. Huiyin will enter school in June, and her mother bought her stationery such as pens, ink, inkstones, abacuses, and slates in April. In addition, she bought Huiyin a leather ball and a harmonica, bought Huilan a beautiful little tricycle, and bought Jianguo a little chicken, a little cloth doll, and a kaleidoscope, so that each child has his or her own favorite toy.

    Every child knows: "Happiness is brought by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" They love the great motherland and leader, and look forward to becoming defenders and builders of the motherland when they grow up. They are very active in all political movements. They have organized many kang-head propaganda groups and automatically go to tell aunts and sisters-in-law about current affairs. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, they conducted propaganda to more than 3,000 people in more than 700 households. They love the Volunteer Army, care about military families, often go to comfort military families, help them sweep the floor, write letters, and give them their favorite labor products. All the Young Pioneers in the school solemnly swore: "Always be ready to build the motherland and strive to realize Chairman Mao's ideals!"

    记石景山发电厂职工子弟学校
    史美玫
    最近我参观了石景山发电厂职工子弟学校。这里的校舍都是新建的，座落在石景山的小山坡上。当我去参观时，正是上午第二堂课结束以后。山坡上闪耀着孩子们的红领巾，荡漾着轻快的笑声。大群的孩子围住了我，和我握手，向我行礼，问我从那里来。当我回答“从城里来”的时候，孩子们的欢呼声就起来了：“又来了新老师啦！”他们好像接待客人似地把我簇拥到了校长办公室。
    校长寇栾鹏在这里已经工作了十年了。他和另外几个青年女教师陪我参观了整个学校，详细地给我介绍了关于学校的一切。
    解放前这里只有三间破烂的庙房，低矮，阴暗，一九四八年曾经倒塌过一次。几个不同班级的孩子，全闹嚷嚷地挤在一起听课，四个人合用一套桌椅，大家轮流着坐在桌旁写字；许多孩子只好伏在门槛上、窗台上、讲台上写字、读书，既没有操场，也没有玩具，图书仪器更是谈不到了。孩子们除了听课外，没有任何的课外活动，一放学就要回家干活：有的回去替父亲挖防空壕、修路、修碉堡，有的上河滩检煤渣，或是帮助妈妈抱弟妹…。孩子们长年穿着补钉的衣服，吃也吃不饱，在他们幼小的心灵里没有一丝的快乐和希望。待孩子们稍为长大了一些，有了劳动力，为了生活只好被迫停学去当小工，下煤窑。因此，愈是高年级，学生人数愈少，能读到小学毕业的，简直是稀有的。
    现在，学校的面目完全改变了。人民政府对于工人子弟教育是那样的关心，在不到一年的时间内，就为学校支出了四亿六千五百多万元，修建了八幢新的校舍。学生从一百多人增到四百六十多人；教师从五人增到十三人。校内的一切设备，都扩充改善了。新建的教室宽敞明亮，每个孩子都有一套洁净舒适的桌椅。操场上，滑梯、压板、秋千、双杠、吊箱等运动器械，应有尽有。图书馆收藏有一百多册儿童图书和画报、教员的参考书，一百多种自然科学仪器标本，二十多套挂图。俱乐部组织有歌咏队、舞蹈组、腰鼓队、广播收听组，还陈列了各样玩具、乐器。在课余，孩子们可以在操场上运动，在图书馆里看书，在俱乐部里游戏，尽情地休息活动。
    工厂的行政领导方面和工会，经常给小学校各种帮助，如工厂医务室定期给孩子们进行健康检查；工会每星期六举办电影晚会，免费招待儿童们；有时还专门放映为孩子们喜爱的电影，如“丹娘”、“红领巾”、“小海军”、“幸福童年”、“团的儿子”等。工厂方面经常把大汽车借给学校，让孩子们到北京市区参观，学习实际知识。
    过去因为生活困难、被迫停学的孩子们也都陆续回来了。学校为了教学的方便和帮助他们学习得更好，经过几次三番的研究，单独组织了一个补习班，让十七、八岁的孩子到学校学习。教学的速度比一般的班级快，内容也丰富。由于孩子们过去曾尝受过失学的痛苦，学习积极，争取在短时间内达到小学毕业的程度。寇校长说得好：“孩子们在毛主席和共产党的抚育下，旧社会带给他们的创痕很快都会医好的！”
    学生的家庭生活也过得很好，一般都能吃细粮，穿新制服。工厂新盖了许多漂亮的工人宿舍，小学校的东边是簇新的“保卫和平”宿舍，南边是红色的“劳动模范”大楼。房子内的设备都很好，每家都有卧房、厨房、院子，阳光、空气也很充足；卫生条件也改善了。孩子在这样新的家庭环境里生长着，身体健康情况也愈来愈好，很少生病，学生的出席率几乎经常保持百分之百。
    我访问了全国劳动模范刘德珍的家庭。他有三个孩子。大女儿刘慧银，今年十岁，小学三年级生；二女儿刘慧兰，五岁；小儿子刘建国还在吃奶。刘德珍每月工资七百多斤米，比解放初提高了将近一倍，孩子们生活得很好，大孩子平均每天能吃到二两肉，一个鸡蛋。妈妈经常给他们做面条、饼、锅贴、饺子、包子等，换着花样吃。父亲经常上合作社给他们买苹果、梨、饼干。去年全家大小都做了新的单衣、夹衣、绒衣、棉衣；连最小的建国，出生才四个月，已给买了四十多尺花布。慧银要在六月间进学校，妈妈在四月里就给她买好了笔墨、砚台、算盘、石板等文具。另外又给慧银买了皮球、口琴，给慧兰买了漂亮的小骑车，给建国买了小鸡、小布人、小花筒，使每个孩子都有自己心爱的玩具。
    每个孩子都知道：“幸福是共产党和毛主席带来的！”他们热爱着伟大的祖国和领袖，期待着长大了当一个祖国的保卫者和建设者。他们在一切政治运动中表现得很活跃。他们组织了许多炕头宣传小组，自动地去给大娘、大嫂讲时事。抗美援朝运动中，他们向七百多户三千多人进行了宣传。他们热爱志愿军，关心军属，经常去慰问军属，帮助他们扫地、写信，把自己心爱的劳作物送给他们。全校少年儿童队员曾经庄严地宣誓：“时刻准备着，为建设祖国，为实现毛主席的理想而奋斗！”
