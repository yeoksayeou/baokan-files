    Liu Zhishan and Other Six Bricklaying Teams
    Increase Bricklaying Efficiency by Two and a Half Times by Learning the Double-Handed Mortar Squeezing Method
    Comrade Editor: The sixth bricklaying teams including Liu Zhishan of the Tenth Engineering Area of the Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the General Construction Office of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, learned the double-handed mortar squeezing method of the Su Changyou team from the newspaper. They used this advanced method to lay bricks on the foundation of a building, increasing production efficiency by two and a half times.

    The six teams, including Liu Zhishan, initially used the double-handed mortar squeezing method to lay bricks, averaging nine hours of work per person per day, and were able to lay 3,591 bricks (the quota is 1,000 bricks per skilled worker per day). In this way, including apprentices, bricklaying efficiency increased by an average of more than two and a half times. The increase in production efficiency further encouraged the work enthusiasm of all workers. The workers said: "If the laborers and mortar are even, and the bricks and mortar can be supplied, and we gradually become more skilled in technology, then, although the bricks in Beijing weigh two and a half catties more than the bricks in the Northeast, we are confident that we can lay 5,000 to 6,000 bricks per person per day."

    刘志山等六个瓦工小组
    学习双手挤浆法，砌砖效率提高两倍半
    编辑同志：中央财政经济委员会总建筑处直属工程公司第十工区刘志山等六个瓦工小组，从报纸上学习了苏长有小组的双手挤浆法。他们运用这种先进方法，在一幢楼基上砌砖，生产效率提高了两倍半。
    刘志山等六个小组初次用双手挤浆法砌砖，每人每天平均工作九小时，已能砌砖三千五百九十一块（定额是每天每个技工砌一千块砖）。这样，包括徒工在内，砌砖效率平均提高两倍半以上。生产效率的提高，更进一步地鼓舞了全体工人的工作情绪。工人们说：“如果壮工和灰均匀，砖、灰能够供应上，我们在技术上再逐步熟练，那末，虽然北京的砖每块比东北的砖重二斤半，我们也有信心每人每日砌五千到六千块砖。”　吴丰仪
