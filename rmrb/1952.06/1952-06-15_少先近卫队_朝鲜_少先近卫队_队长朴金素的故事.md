    Young Pioneer Guard

    --The Story of Park Jin-sook, Captain of the Korean "Young Pioneer Guard"

    Editor's Note: This translation originally appeared in "People's Literature," June 1952. It depicts how Park Jin-sook, a Korean girl, was persecuted and her family destroyed by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandits, and how, with the help of the Korean guerrillas and other young comrades, she organized the "Young Pioneer Guard" and carried out heroic underground struggles in a city temporarily occupied by the invading forces, until the Korean People's Army liberated the city. This is a powerful document of Korean children accusing American imperialism of bloody crimes, and also a true record of the anti-aggression struggles of Korean young heroes. A Korean film based on this story will soon be shown in our country.

    I am fourteen years old this year. I came to Moscow from South Hamgyong Province, Korea. The Young Pioneers in Moscow asked me to talk about how we lived and fought against the American aggressors after they invaded our hometown. Now I will tell the story of the "Young Pioneer Guard."

    (I) Only Three of Us Remained

    I will never forget October 11, 1950. On this day, the People's Army troops temporarily withdrew from our city on orders from headquarters. My father went with them. He could not calmly watch what the American aggressors were doing on our land. Therefore, although my three older brothers were already fighting on the front lines, my father still decided to join the People's Army.

    …Mother was preparing father's luggage. We—the children—sat cross-legged around father. On this last night, he told us some of the most important things. He told us the story of the young men and women living in the remote mining city of Krasnodon. As we listened to his moving story, the events of the recent past appeared before us like a picture. Look, Lyuba Shevtsova and Sergei Tyulenin are quietly walking along the empty streets of Krasnodon at night. They are going to set fire to the German recruitment office. A young man quickly and nimbly climbed to the high roof and raised the red flag. …

    Someone was knocking on the window.

    "It's time to go," father said, standing up. "I'll tell you the rest of the story after the victory."

    We saw father off far into the suburbs, and then returned to the city with many other women.

    "You'd better leave here," they said to mother, "aren't you a member of the Democratic Women's League? If the Americans occupy the city, they might make trouble for you."

    Mother listened to their kind advice, and the next morning we moved to a small village.

    The Americans occupied the city. Syngman Rhee's troops entered the village. One day, the woman who was hiding us ran in from outside, her face covered with tears.

    "A notice has been posted in the square," she cried, "saying that anyone who hides Labor Party members or Democratic Women's League members will be shot."

    We were silent. Mother was the first to break the silence.

    "Let's do it this way, children," she said, "don't let innocent people suffer for us, pack up, we can only go home."

    We returned to the city. The door of our house was wide open, the house was dark, with only empty walls left. Everything had been looted, not even a thread was left.

    "Who did this?" Mother asked the landlord in a daze.

    He shrugged his shoulders:

    "Americans have been here, I don't know anything."

    The next morning, the landlord ran to our place.

    "You have to find another place," he persuaded, "I can't rent the house to the families of People's Army soldiers, I can't take the risk, I still have my own family."

    Mother intended to persuade him to let us live here quietly, but the landlord could not be persuaded. He gave us advance notice that if we hadn't vacated the house by evening, we would be driven out by the Syngman Rhee police the next morning. Of course, we couldn't find a place before evening. In the morning, the police came. Without saying a word, the police pushed us into the street.

    "Leave the city quickly," one of the policemen advised us, "or it will be even worse!"

    But where could we go, leaving the city where we grew up? Outside the city, mother found an empty, dilapidated shack. The gray-blue sky was visible through the roof, and the nearby wilderness could be seen through the broken walls. From morning to night we walked around everywhere looking for something to eat. This was in November—cold winds blowing frequently, and autumn rains pouring down.

    No one came to look for us in our little shack. But one night, we were already asleep, huddled on the ground. Someone knocked on the door, and the police shouted mother's name.

    "It's been hard to find you," he said. "Hey, write a receipt for receiving the summons. Go to the police station tomorrow morning, don't think about hiding, even if you hide underground, we will find you." The policeman bent over at the door and walked out of the little shack.

    My older sister—a student at the Normal College—wanted mother to hide immediately, no matter what, and not to go to the police station, but it was too difficult to persuade mother.

    "If I hide, what will happen to you?" she asked, "No, I must go to the police station, I won't be in danger. I really haven't done anything bad in my life."

    Mother did not return from the police station. We waited for her until evening. We couldn't sleep for a long time. Mother did not return.

    The next day, mother still did not return. So I went to the police station with my sister. We were taken to the highest-ranking American officer.

    "Why was our mother arrested?" my sister asked him. The translator translated her question to the American officer.

    "Your mother is a communist," the American replied. "We came here to eliminate all communists, understand?"

    But we didn't understand anything. My sister repeated the question again. This time it was not the American who spoke, but the translator himself who answered:

    "Your mother raised three sons who are soldiers in the People's Army, you'd better not wait for her to come back."

    "If you want to kill her for this," my sister shouted, "wait until the People's Army comes, and see what they do to you then!"

    The translator translated my sister's words completely to the American, and then the American jumped up from his seat and hit my sister's face with the butt of his pistol. At this time, several other Americans ran over and dragged my sister to the next room. I heard her scream, and rushed to save her, but the police blocked my way.

    "Run, fool, run quickly! Otherwise, you will be beaten to death too." The policeman secretly said to me in Korean, and pushed me out the door.

    Two days later, in the evening, several strangers carried my sister back on a mat. She was already having difficulty breathing and didn't recognize us at all. We sat guarding her until the next morning, gently wiping her bleeding lips with a wet rag. In the morning, my sister died.

    I dug a grave for her myself, and buried my sister in the wilderness next to our little shack. I, my younger sister, and my younger brother, lonely, crying, returned home.

    That's how only three of us were left.

    (II) The Worst Student

    Our life became more difficult. I went to the garbage dump to pick up empty American cans, trying my best to wash out the remaining things inside, and put grass into the water. This way we got a little thin soup, with a few beads of oil floating on the surface. We lived on this. I also had to take care of my younger brother and sister. I alone was both mother and older sister.

    But they didn't even let me off, and another stranger came to our little shack.

    "Hello, Park Jin-sook!" he said, "I am the new teacher in your school, we will resume classes tomorrow. Be careful, don't delay the class."

    I replied to him that I couldn't go to school because no one was taking care of my younger brother and sister.

    "You just don't want to study under the new regime," he suddenly shouted, "but we must force you to study!" He raised his cane and hit me. …

    …I went to school, everything seemed the same as before: this is the classroom, that is the desk, still in the same place, still those children—my classmates. But when the teacher walked into the classroom at the beginning of the class, he was very surprised to see me.

    "Why are you sitting in the first seat?" he asked, "Is this your place?"

    A boy stood up and said to the teacher that I was the best student and always sat in the first seat.

    "Nonsense," the teacher retorted, "go, change a seat!" So he told me to sit in the last seat.

    I picked up my book and sat in the back seat without saying a word.

    The class began. The teacher walked around the classroom lecturing. He told us that the Korean People's regime was a bad regime, and that the American army was the greatest friend of the Korean people. Even the smallest student knew that not a single word the teacher said was true. I immediately stopped listening to his nonsense.

    Sitting in the last seat, I recalled how beautiful our life was before the war, I recalled our Young Pioneer team, our extremely interesting gatherings, excursions, our group studies…

    The teacher's shout interrupted my thoughts.

    "Park Jin-sook, repeat what I just said."

    I hadn't listened to what he had just said, and even if I had heard it, I still wouldn't repeat his hateful, false lies. I lowered my head and didn't say a word.

    "Don't you know?" the teacher shouted, "You, I think, are the worst student in this class."

    That's how I became the worst student from the first class.

    "Let it go," I thought, "maybe they will kick me out of school."

    After class, the teacher kept me behind.

    "Come with me to the principal, he wants to see you," he said.

    The principal received me unhappily. He was also new to the school, and he was wearing the uniform of an officer in the Syngman Rhee army.

    "You don't like the new order in the school, do you?" he asked.

    I didn't say a word.

    "We are going to beat you until you are obedient, do you hear?!" the principal shouted, and then tied my arms tightly and made me kneel in the corner of the wall. "I sentence you to kneel until tomorrow morning."

    I didn't say a word. I don't know how much time passed—maybe two hours, maybe more. I felt sadness and humiliation, but I bit my lip to keep myself from crying in front of them.

    I knelt in the corner of the wall until evening, when it was completely dark. I jumped out of the window and ran home. I settled my younger brother and sister and let them sleep. Only then did I cry to my heart's content.

    I lay there, looking at the dark sky visible through the roof, thinking. Of course, I had to forget about school. But what to do? What to do? That's how I fell asleep without thinking about anything. And in the morning, I remembered the story my father told about the mining city of Krasnodon, the story of those Russian young men and women who did not succumb to the enemy. I, alone, naturally couldn't do anything, but if we had an organization…

    A few days later, I heard people on the street saying that in the countryside, twenty-five kilometers away from us, brave people had appeared. They were fighting against the American devils and the Rhee bandits.

    I decided to set off to this countryside, I decided to look for these people.

    (III) The "Young Pioneer Guard" Was Born

    When I walked to this village, it was already night. It was dark very early in November, and I was almost groping my way on the road. It was raining, mixed with a little bit of snow.

    I had finally reached this village, but what to do next? When I came here, I didn't consider how to find those who were fighting the American devils. Who to ask?

    The doors of those little shacks were closed. Patrols were walking back and forth on the village street—two Syngman Rhee soldiers. I ran into a narrow alley next to the road, squatted down with my chin between my knees.

    "I have to sit here until dawn," I said to myself. "I'll look for them in the morning…"

    The sky was bone-chillingly cold and damp. Suddenly it was like a dream…

    Across the street, two people were pasting leaflets on the wall. I hurried to them. One of them turned around and grabbed my shoulder.

    "Don't make a sound, little girl, don't make a sound," he said in a low voice, "just pretend you didn't see anything."

    The other one touched his hand and said, "Let's go."

    In the blink of an eye, they were about to disappear suddenly, just as they had suddenly appeared. I would be left behind. I said very urgently.

    "Please don't leave me behind," I said, "they killed my sister, they drove us out of our house, they want to kill my mother, please help us…."

    "Let's go," one of them repeated again. But this time he was telling me to go with them.

    We walked for a long time, past one shack after another, through some fences, picking our way through dark alleys.

    …We entered a small shack, it was very warm inside, the faint lamplight on the table was flickering. The earthen chimney on the stove was singing various tunes. The aroma of cooking rice was sent from the room next door. It was so good and comfortable here. I immediately felt how tired I was, I really wanted to curl up in some corner and sleep.

    Behind the table sat a short man with white hair and stern eyes watching me.

    "Are you sent by the Americans?" he asked.

    "No, I wanted to come myself," I replied, and cried.

    "Don't cry, you won't be embarrassed here."

    "I'm not crying for this."

    "Are you hungry?" he asked, and smiled.

    "Yes," I replied, also smiling with tears in my eyes.

    I hadn't eaten rice for a long time. They put a large bowl of rice in front of me. I asked them to allow me to take some home—my younger sister and brother, they hadn't eaten rice for a long time either. The man sitting behind the table suddenly turned his back and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief.

    Then, I told them our whole history. I talked for a long time, and they listened very attentively, without interrupting me or asking questions. When I finished speaking, I looked up, the man was still sitting behind the table, not moving, his white-haired head resting on his large, strong hands.

    "Did you cry?" I asked quietly.

    "No, I was thinking, child," he replied, "I was thinking, what price should the enemies pay for all the suffering they have brought to our hometown." He was silent for a while. "It doesn't matter, you can live with us, be my daughter, child…."

    "I still want to go back to the city," I replied. "I hate them, I want to fight."

    "But how do you want to fight?"

    "Have you read 'Young Guard'?" I asked him back.

    …Until morning, we were sitting next to the table… Here, in this small shack, under this faint lamplight, the future struggle plan—the activity plan of the "Young Pioneer Guard"—was formulated. The creator and central figure of this plan was this white-haired old man sitting behind the table—a former farmer, and now the captain of the underground guerrilla team of the Labor Party.

    …I returned to the city, and this time it wasn't like when I left here, now I knew succinctly—how I should carry out the struggle.

    I decided to tell my plan first to Zhu Heisuo—our Young Pioneer brigade instructor. I arrived at her place when it was getting dark, and I knocked on her window. When I walked in, Zhu Heisuo had a piece of embroidery on her lap, as if she was completely focused on embroidery. But on the table I saw an inkstone and a writing brush with a wet tip. No, Zhu Heisuo was not doing embroidery.

    "I hate the Americans, what about you?" I asked her straightforwardly.

    "I don't understand," she said, "why you thought of telling me this? I can go to the police station to report you immediately."

    I said: "Dear Zhu Heisuo, I understand you completely, you won't go anywhere, and you won't report me no matter what! You really don't trust me." So I told Zhu Heisuo everything that happened last night, the matter of our "Young Pioneer Guard"… Zhu Heisuo put the embroidery aside, and I saw that on her lap was a white leaflet, speckled with Korean characters, a leaflet calling people to fight. …

    The two of us went together to find all of our most active Young Pioneers, and had deep conversations with each of them. This is how the headquarters of our future "Young Pioneer Guard" was organized.

    One day, all the members of the headquarters came to attend the first meeting. The meeting was held one night in my little shack. My younger brother Yingsuo was already asleep, his head resting on my lap. We didn't turn on the lights, so as not to attract attention. The cold autumn moon shone in from the hole in the roof, and the cold wind was sweeping the dry fallen leaves on the surrounding wilderness.

    We sat down in a circle: Mu Zecang, Kang Bobo, Qi Qicuo, Ji Wengan, Weng Mianhu, Zhu Heisuo, and me—seven people, seven headquarters personnel. Each of us took turns standing in the middle of the circle, using a small flashlight to illuminate the opened "Young Guard" novel, reading the oath, our oath was almost exactly like the oath of the Young Guard.

    "I, Mu Zecang, join the ranks of the 'Young Pioneer Guard' members, in front of my comrades, in front of the afflicted land of the motherland, in front of the people of the whole country, I solemnly swear…"——reading the heavy guerrilla oath.

    Comrades elected me as the captain. Mu Zecang was elected as the vice-captain. He used to be the chairman of our Young Pioneer team committee. The "Young Pioneer Guard" was thus born.

    (IV) Strike

    …At the headquarters meeting, a decision was made: to disrupt learning in the school at any cost. We could not tolerate that teacher sent by Syngman Rhee instilling fascist ideas into the minds of our Young Pioneers. We assigned all thirteen streets in the city to the members of the headquarters, and each of us had to make sure that the boys and girls on that street did not go to school. We explained to the children why this had to be done. As a result, fewer and fewer students went to school every day. The principal wanted to use the police to help rectify the school. At this time, we had to use the final means—smashing all the glass windows in the school. The classrooms were drafty everywhere. It was even cold wearing a coat.

    But once one of our boys was caught. This child was detained in the principal's office for a long time, and only returned home at night. At that time, I asked him why he didn't come back for so long. He proudly stated:

    "They beat me hard because I broke the glass windows."

    "Did you admit it?" I asked in surprise.

    "Young Pioneers never lie."

    "You shouldn't lie to your comrades," I explained to him, "but you must be cunning to the enemy. You can tell the principal that you accidentally hit the glass while using a stick to hit a bird."

    The next day, twenty-five boys were caught, and all twenty-five people replied that they broke the glass because they were hitting birds.

    The teachers in the school treated them with candy, persuaded them, and threatened them, but no one said who taught them to break the glass.

    In the evening, I asked them:

    "Why didn't you denounce me?"

    "Young Pioneers don't betray their leaders. Aren't we Young Pioneers anymore?" one boy said in surprise.

    "We are always Young Pioneers," I replied.

    There were two schools in the city. A week after the strike movement began, both schools closed down. The "Young Pioneer Guard" began its activities.

    (V) One Night

    Our city was garrisoned with: the US military regimental headquarters, the Gendarmerie headquarters, the Quartermaster's office, and other agencies. Wires connected these agencies like spider webs.

    Every morning, the "Young Pioneer Guard" headquarters convened a meeting. At one of the meetings, a resolution was passed to cut off the American's communication lines.

    Comrades entrusted Ji Wengan and me to carry out this task. One night, we set off to the American headquarters, where we decided to cut the wires. The Americans probably didn't expect that we would operate in front of their eyes.

    A sentry was standing next to the gate of the courtyard, and there was no one on the street anymore. Ji Wengan cut a thick wire, and I pulled out a large section of copper wire from the wire, and we reconnected the two ends of the empty wire. We did all this very precisely, just like the American signal corps. I even had time to pack up the broken pieces of wire on the ground, and no one found us.

    "Let's run now," I said. But Ji Wengan disagreed, so we crossed the street and hid behind the fence of the house next door. About fifteen minutes later, two signal corps soldiers came out of the US military headquarters, shining their flashlights on the section of wire we cut, but they didn't find anything and walked on.

    Half an hour later, the signal corps soldiers returned to the headquarters.

    "Let's go," I pulled Ji Wengan.

    At this time, seven signal corps soldiers suddenly came out of the headquarters, pushing a roll of wire, they decided to replace all the wires. They didn't finally repair the lines until almost noon. When it got dark, in the same place, in the same way, the wires were cut again.

    This is how we began a silent struggle with the American signal corps, and this struggle did not stop until the day of liberation.

    (VI) We Had Weapons

    We didn't have weapons, we decided to get them. Outside the city, in a large open space, there were cargo trucks parked, covered with tarpaulins. The trucks contained boxes of bombs, bullets, and landmines. The open space was guarded. The green ground was surrounded by a path trampled out by sentries. Eight sentries, every two sentries walked face to face from both ends of the open space. After they met, they turned around and walked away. At night, strong searchlights illuminated this cordon line. According to the plan suggested by Mu Zecang, we decided to cross the cordon line when the sentries met and walked away. We observed that they met once every twenty-five minutes. Exactly at twelve fifty, Mu Zecang climbed over the cordon line, and Weng Mianhu and I climbed over after him. I tried my best not to breathe… It was terrible to look back, I seemed to feel that someone would shout sternly: "Who is it?" and at the same time the sentry's gun would fire. But everything passed safely. I climbed to the large wheel of a truck on the side, carefully climbed into the truck, and crawled under the tarpaulin. At this time, I felt very safe. I had a pair of pliers behind the belt of my jacket. With these pliers, I opened the box. Ah, there it is, the cold bullets. I filled the pockets of my short jacket with bullets, hid them in my arms, trying to take as much as possible.

    Suddenly, I felt that I had been in the truck for too long. We had agreed that at one forty at night, when the sentries walked away on both sides again, we would cross the cordon line. I climbed to the ground. I looked around, it was very quiet, there was no one. The searchlights were shining on the cordon line, and the heavy footsteps of the sentries could be heard very clearly. I didn't see those two boys. Maybe, they left without waiting for me? No, they wouldn't leave me behind, only I alone couldn't pass through the cordon line. ——Maybe Mu Zecang's watch stopped, I lay on the ground waiting. At this time, the moon ran behind the clouds, the ground was completely dark, I got out of the truck disappointedly, and lay in the puddle, my short jacket was soaked, I felt the cold water. But, at this time I heard a rustling sound, it was Mu Zecang; after a while, Weng Mianhu appeared again. Mu Zecang climbed towards the cordon line silently, we climbed behind him…

    In the morning, at the headquarters meeting, we were respected by everyone like heroes. Mu Zecang brought back two anti-tank grenades, and Weng Mianhu, in addition to bringing back short gun bullets, also brought back a landmine. According to the decision of the headquarters, such raids would be carried out twice every week. This is how we got weapons.

    (VII) "Comrades, You Are Free!"

    We didn't know anything about mother's news. Several times I went to the Gendarmerie headquarters in the city. You know, every time we tried our best to prepare a package of precious things to send! In a small package, there was delicious food: fresh cakes, baked by Zhu Heisuo; rice, cooked by Mu Zecang's mother; and even American biscuits, which Kang Bobo didn't know where he got from.

    I walked into the Gendarmerie headquarters and lined up in the queue. But every time I got a short answer:

    "We don't know anything about your mother."

    I walked home slowly, back to our dilapidated shack in the suburbs… Little Yingsuo ran to meet me. And shouted happily:

    "Sister, did you go to mother's place? Hurry up and show me, what did mother send?"——So he opened the small package, and Yingsuo ate the cakes, rice, and American biscuits with great relish.

    …Twice a week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, a "Studebaker" car drove out of the city's prison, packed with people, with American machine gunners sitting on both sides of the car. Twice a week in the valley outside the city they shot the prisoners.

    We could not calmly watch the American executioners murder our fathers and mothers. We already had a strong, united organization, and we already had weapons. So at one headquarters meeting, Mu Zecang proposed to attack the prison and release all the prisoners. The underground party comrades also agreed with us to do so, and helped us to formulate a plan to attack the prison.

    …Outside the city, surrounded by barbed wire, stood a narrow, dark barracks without windows——the prison. Searchlights shone on the square in front of the house. Next to the prison was the guardhouse. Where the guards lived.

    At one o'clock at night we crawled towards the barbed wire…

    The American sentry stood there, leaning his shoulder against the wall, everything around was very quiet…. From somewhere behind the heavy prison door came a desolate, slow song.

    Ji Wengan pulled out a knife from his arms, and crawled towards the sentry, but suddenly crawled back.

    "Mu Zecang," he said excitedly in a low voice, "I can't, I have never killed anyone."

    Mu Zecang silently took the knife from his hand…. The sentry didn't even have time to scream, he just turned around and slowly fell at Mu Zecang's feet.

    I ran to the door of the house, using pliers to clamp the handle on the door, trying to turn it. But the door handle wouldn't turn. Just as Mu Zecang came to help me,——the door opened.

    At this time, Ji Wengan and other children came after us. They used wooden pillars to prop up the door of the guardhouse, where the guards lived.

    …I remember how I walked into the dark house step by step, and how a strong, suffocating smell came over me.

    "Comrades! Fellow villagers! Come out! You are free!" I shouted loudly.

    No one came out, the house was dead silent, as if there was no one here.

    "Come out!" I shouted again. "Come out, we order you, we are guerrillas."

    Then a group of shadows rushed towards me. People came out of the house one after another. They couldn't believe that they were free like this, they were crying and laughing.

    "Quick, quick, go to the river, there's no time to thank you now!" Mu Zecang urged them. But they didn't listen to him…

    I stood by the door of the house, watching the faces of the women walking past me, I was looking for mother. Many people had already passed by, but all of them were strangers. Suddenly someone hugged me, I immediately felt who it was, I suddenly felt that I couldn't breathe.

    "Mother, mother!"

    This was her, my mother.

    …And at this time the American soldiers in the guardhouse were banging on the door with their rifle butts, the glass shattered with a crash. At this time, someone hit hard with the rifle butt, trying to knock the iron window bars down from the window. Ji Wengan ran to get a pillar and cut off the wire, and the searchlights went out. At this time, all the people standing in the open space in front of the prison ran to the gate of the barbed wire…

    "Run, comrades! Escape, comrades!" I heard Mu Zecang's voice, he was standing next to the iron-barred window of the guardhouse, I saw, his hand waved, and he threw a bunch of grenades in.

    (VIII) The Gasoline Depot Exploded

    Every day the underground party comrades listened to the radio, hearing news of American planes bombing our cities and villages. We copied these messages and pasted these leaflets all over the city. Every day, the heavy enemy "Flying Fortresses" flew over our heads. They went out to bomb in the evening, and bombed back in the middle of the night. The airport was not far from the city.

    According to the instructions of the superior comrades, we passed a resolution to set fire to the American airport's gasoline. Zhu Heisuo, Kang Bobo, and I crawled towards the gasoline depot from the north side of the airport. We lay in the narrow trenches around the airport. We had to fire at the gasoline depot with automatic rifles. Our plan was this: we used shooting to attract their attention, the American soldiers would run to the north, and at this time Mu Zecang and the other children would set fire to the gasoline depot on the south side.

    …It was a dark November night, snowing, large snowflakes falling on our shoulders and hands. The snowflakes melted on our faces, and cold snow water flowed into our collars, my fingers were frozen. …Quietly, none of us were in the mood to speak, we were thinking about our children, who were crawling towards the gasoline depot from the south side at this time.

    "It's time." Zhu Heisuo said. I pounced on the slope. Something suddenly hit my shoulder. The automatic rifle trembled in my hand, and I saw fire spraying out from the trembling barrel. On my left and right were our comrades shooting. I gritted my teeth and shot in the dark. Suddenly I heard a sound, and someone was running towards our trench…

    "Shoot, shoot, what are you looking at! The enemy is bypassing from behind!" Kang Bobo shouted to me. I turned my head and saw the shadow of a tall, clumsy American soldier appearing not far from me. I turned the automatic rifle, and an American soldier fell down waving his hands.

    …Bright flames flashed in front of us, the flames rose into the sky, burning from south to north, and the flames enveloped the entire gasoline depot. One after another, huge gasoline drums exploded. …

    "Quick, quick! Now we retreat!" Zhu Heisuo shouted to me.

    We crawled onto the road and ran in the direction of going to the city, behind us was a sea of ​​flames. …

    We ran along the road without looking back, fell and climbed up again! Run forward again. I was so happy that I wanted to sing and dance. The gasoline depot was burned to ashes.

    (IX) The Happy Time Has Come!

    …The happy time has come——the People's Army began to attack. The American devils and the Rhee bandits desperately abandoned the city. We dug pits in the road, and our boys, hiding in the shrub forest, shot at the fleeing American devils and Rhee bandits with automatic rifles.

    Kang Bobo carried out the last order of the "Young Pioneer Guard" headquarters, dug out our Young Pioneer flag in the school's garden, and climbed to the bell tower again, raising it high above the city.

    …We stood on the street, welcoming the People's Army troops walking towards us, one company, one battalion, one regiment walked past in turn, the tanks rumbled, the gun carriages galloped on the bumpy road. Women ran out to welcome the soldiers, embracing our liberators, kissing them, how many happy tears people shed on this day of celebrating victory!

    The activities of the underground youth organization named "Young Pioneer Guard" thus ended. The country gave a very high evaluation to our small achievements. Six comrades from the "Young Pioneer Guard" headquarters received combat medals, and I, as the captain, received the Third Class National Flag Medal.

    少先近卫队
    ——朝鲜“少先近卫队”队长朴金素的故事
    编者按：这篇译文原载“人民文学”一九五二年六月号，它描写朝鲜女孩子朴金素怎样被美国侵略军和李承晚匪帮逼害得家破人亡，以及她怎样在朝鲜游击队的帮助下和其他少年同志共同组织了“少先近卫队”，在暂时被侵略军占领的城市里进行英勇的地下斗争，直到朝鲜人民军解放了这个城市。这是朝鲜儿童控诉美帝国主义血腥罪行的有力文件，也是朝鲜少年勇士们反侵略斗争的真实纪录。以这个故事为基本内容的朝鲜影片，不久将在我国放映。
    我今年十四岁。我从朝鲜咸镜南道来到了莫斯科。在莫斯科的少先队员们请我讲讲，当美国侵略者侵略到我们家乡以后，我们是怎样生活，以及我们是怎样和他们进行斗争的。我现在就来讲讲“少先近卫队”的故事。
    （一）只剩下了我们三个
    我忘不了一九五○年十月十一日。这一天，人民军的部队奉了总部的命令暂时撤离了我们的城市。我的父亲就和他们一道去了。他不能平静地看着美国侵略者在我们土地上所做的事情。因此，虽然我的三个哥哥已经在前线作战，父亲仍然决定去参加人民军。
    ……妈妈为父亲准备着行装。我们——孩子们——就盘着腿围绕着父亲坐下来。在这最后一个晚上，他和我们讲了最重要的一些话。他对我们讲了生活在遥远的矿工城市克拉斯诺顿的男女青年们的故事。我们听着他的动人的故事，那过去不久的事情就像一幅图画似的出现在我们面前。看，刘巴·薛夫左娃和谢尔盖·邱列宁沿着夜晚的空旷的克拉斯诺顿的街道悄悄地走着。他们要去放火烧德国人的介绍所。一个青年又迅速、又敏捷地爬到高高的屋顶上，竖起了红旗。……
    有人在敲窗子了。
    “该走了，”父亲说，一面站了起来。“剩下的故事等胜利以后再给你们讲吧。”
    我们送父亲一直送到郊外很远的地方，后来就和其他的许多妇女们一同回到城里。
    “你最好还是离开这里，”他们对母亲说，“你不是民主妇女同盟的会员吗？假使美国人占领了城市，他们可能会找你的麻烦。”
    妈妈听了他们善意的劝告，在第二天早上，我们就搬到一个小村子里去了。
    美国人占领了城市。村里开进了李承晚的部队。有一天，隐藏着我们的妇人从外面跑来，满脸流着眼泪。
    “在广场上贴出了一张布告，”她哭着说，“上面说无论什么人隐藏了劳动党党员或是民主妇女同盟的会员都要枪毙。”
    我们没有作声。妈妈第一个打破了沉默。
    “就这样吧，孩子们，”她说，“不要使无辜的人为了我们而受害，准备好东西，我们只有回家去吧。”
    我们又回到了城里。我们家里的门大开着，房子里黑黑的，只剩下空空的墙壁，所有的东西都被抢走了，连一根线也没剩下。
    “这是谁弄的？”妈妈发呆地问房东。
    他耸耸肩头：
    “这里曾经来过美国人，我什么也不知道。”
    第二天早上，房东跑到我们这里来。
    “你们要另外找房子了，”他劝说着，“我不能把房子租给人民军的家属，我不能冒这个险，我还有自己的一家大小。”
    妈妈打算说服他，仍旧让我们安静地住在这里，但房东怎么也说不通。他预先通知我们，假如到晚上，我们还没把房子让出来，第二天早上我们就要被李承晚的警察赶出去。当然，天晚以前我们是找不着地方的。早上，警察来了。不由分说，警察就把我们推到街上去了。
    “赶快离开城里走吧，”有一个警察劝我们说，“不然将会更糟糕！”
    可是，离开自己生长的城市，我们能到什么地方去呢？在城外，妈妈找到了一个空的半破烂了的小茅屋。屋顶上露着灰蓝的天空，隔着破墙可以看到附近的旷野。从早到晚我们到处走着寻找着可吃的东西。这正是十一月的时候——经常的刮着寒冷的风，下着秋天的倾盆大雨。
    没有谁到我们这个小茅屋里来找过我们。但是有一天下晚，我们已经睡了，大家蜷缩在地上。有人敲门了，警察喊着妈妈的名字。
    “好容易才找到你啊，”他说。“喂，写一个收到了传票的收条。明天早上到警察局去，不要想躲起来吧，就是躲到地底下去，我们也会把你找到的。”警察在门边弯着腰从小茅屋里走出去了。
    姐姐——师范学院的大学生，要妈妈立刻躲起来，无论怎样都不要到警察局去，但是要说服妈妈是太难了。
    “假使我躲起来，你们会怎么样呢？”她问，“不，我必须去警察局，我不会有危险的。我实在一辈子没有作过一点坏事情。”
    妈妈就没有从警察局回来。我们等她一直等到晚上。我们很久都不能睡着。妈妈没有回来。
    第二天妈妈仍旧没有回来。于是我就和姐姐一道到警察局里去了。我们被带到一个最高级的美国军官面前。
    “我们的妈妈为什么被逮捕了？”姐姐问他。翻译把她的问题翻译给美国军官。
    “你的妈妈是个共产党员，”美国人回答说。“我们到这里来，就是为了消灭所有的共产党员，明白吗？”
    但我们什么也不明白。姐姐又重复问了一遍。这时已经不是美国人说话了，而是翻译自己来回答问题了：
    “你的妈妈养育了三个当人民军的儿子，你们最好不要等她回去了。”
    “假如你们为了这个要杀她，”姐姐喊叫着，“等人民军来的时候，看那时把你们怎么办吧！”
    翻译把姐姐的话完全翻给那个美国人了，于是那个美国人从自己的座位上跳了起来，用手枪柄打姐姐的脸。这时又跑来了另外几个美国人，把姐姐拖到隔壁的房间里去。我听到她的叫声，急忙跑去救她，但是警察拦住了我的路。
    “跑呀，傻瓜，赶快跑吧！不然要把你也打死的。”这个警察用朝鲜话偷偷的对我说，把我推出门口去。
    过了两天，在晚上，几个不认识的人把姐姐放在席子上抬回来了。她已经呼吸困难起来，完全不认识我们了。我们坐着守护着她，直到第二天早晨，一面用湿的破布轻轻地揩着她的流血的嘴唇。到了早晨，姐姐就死了。
    我自己给她挖了一个坟墓，把姐姐埋葬在我们小茅屋旁边的荒地里。我，妹妹和弟弟，孤独的，哭泣着回到了家里。
    就这样，只剩下了我们三个。
    （二）最坏的学生
    我们的生活变得更困难了。我到垃圾堆里去拾空的美国罐头，尽量把里面剩的东西洗出来，把草搁进水里。这样就得到了一点稀薄的汤水，水面上浮着少数的油珠子。我们就吃这个维持生活。我还必须照管着弟弟和妹妹。就是我一个人，又做妈妈，又做姐姐。
    但是他们连我也不放过，又有一个陌生人到我们的小茅屋里来了。
    “你好啊，朴金素！”他说，“我是你的学校里的新来的老师，明天我们要恢复上课了。注意啊，不要耽误了上课。”
    我回答他，我不能到学校去上课，因为没有人照管我的弟弟、妹妹。
    “你就是在新政权下不想去学习，”忽然他叫起来，“但我们一定要强迫你去学习！”他举起手杖就打我。……
    ……我到学校里去了，一切都好像和从前一样：这是教室，那是课桌，仍旧放在原来的地方，还是那些孩子们——我的同学们。但在开始上课时，老师一走进教室就看到了我，他很奇怪。
    “你为什么坐在第一个位子上？”他问，“难道这是你的地方吗？”
    有个男孩子站起来了，对老师说我是最好的学生，经常总是坐在第一个位子上的。
    “胡说，”老师反驳说，“去，换一个位子！”于是他叫我坐到最后一个位子上去。
    我拿起了自己的书，不作声地坐到最后面的位子上去。
    开始讲课了。老师顺着教室走着讲着。他对我们说，朝鲜人民政权是坏的政权，而美国军队是朝鲜人民的最伟大的朋友。连最小的学生也知道这个老师说的没有一个字是真话。我马上就不去听他胡说了。
    我坐在最后面的位子上，回想起在战争以前我们的生活多么美好啊，我回想起我们的少先队，我们那极有趣味的集会、远足，我们的小组学习……
    老师的喊声打断了我的沉思。
    “朴金素，你重说一遍，我刚才说的什么。”
    我没有去听他刚才说的什么，而即使我听到了，同样地，我也不会去重复他那使人憎恨的虚伪的谎话。我低着头没有作声。
    “你不知道吗？”老师叫起来，“你呀，我看是这班里最坏的学生。”
    就这样，从第一堂课起我就变成最坏的学生了。
    “随它去吧，”我想，“也许他们会把我赶出学校去。”
    下课以后，老师把我留下来。
    “跟我一道到校长那里去，他要见你。”他说。
    校长不高兴的接见了我。他也是新到学校来的，他穿着李承晚军队的军官制服。
    “学校里的新秩序不合你的意，是吗？”他问。
    我没有作声。
    “我们要把你揍得服服帖帖，听见没有？！”校长喊叫着，于是把我的手臂牢牢地捆起来，把我放在墙角里跪着。“罚你跪到明天早上。”
    我没有作声。不知道过了多少时候，——也许是两个钟头，也许更多一些。我感到悲哀和侮辱，但我咬紧了嘴唇，不使自己在他们面前哭出来。
    我在墙角里一直跪到晚上，这时天已经完全黑了。我从窗子里跳了出去，跑回家里。我把弟弟、妹妹安置好，让他们睡了。这时我才尽情地哭起来。
    我躺着，望着屋顶上露着的黑黑的天空，一边想着。自然，关于学校的事我必须忘掉它。但是作什么呢？作什么呢？就这样我什么也没有想的睡着了。而在早上，我想起了父亲讲的关于矿工城市克拉斯诺顿的故事，想起了那些俄罗斯的青年男女们不屈服于敌人的故事。我，一个人，自然什么也不可能做，但是假如我们有个组织的话……
    过了几天以后，我在街上听到人们说，在乡下，离我们二十五公里的地方，出现了勇敢的人们。他们和美国鬼子和李匪军们进行着斗争。
    我决定了出发到这个乡下去，我决定要去寻找这些人。
    （三）“少先近卫队”产生了
    当我走到这个村子的时候，已经是夜里了。十一月里很早就黑了，我差不多是在路上摸索着走的。天在下着雨，混合着一点儿雪花。
    我总算已经走到了这个村子，但是再往前怎么办呢？到这里来时，我没有考虑到怎样去找那些和美国鬼子斗争的人。去问谁呢？
    那些小茅屋的门都关上了。在村子里的大街上巡逻兵在走来走去——是两个李承晚的兵。我跑进旁边一条狭窄的小巷子里，弯着腰蹲在那里，把下巴夹在膝头中间。
    “不得不在这里坐到天亮了，”我对自己说。“到早上再去找吧……。”
    天是刺骨的冷和潮湿。突然真像做梦了……
    在街对面两个人在墙上贴传单。我急忙跑到他们那里去。有一个人回转身来一把抓住我的肩膀。
    “不要作声，小女孩，不要作声，”他低低地说，“你只当什么也没有看见。”
    另一个碰碰他的手说：“我们走吧。”
    一转眼他们就要突然地消失了，像他们突然出现那样。我会被扔下了。我非常急促地说着。
    “请你们不要丢掉我，”我说，“他们杀死了我的姐姐，他们把我们从家里赶出来，他们还要害死我的妈妈，请你们帮助我们……。”
    “我们走吧，”有一个又重复地说了一遍。但是这一回是叫我一块走了。
    我们走了很久，经过一个茅屋又一个茅屋，穿过了一些篱笆，挑着黑暗的小巷子走。
    ……我们走进了一间小茅屋，里面很温暖，桌上的微弱的灯光在摇动着。火炉上的土烟囱唱着各种的调子。不知道从隔壁的那一间房间里送过来煮饭的香气。这里是多么的好和舒服啊。我马上觉得我是多么疲倦，我真想蜷缩在哪个角落里睡觉去。
    在桌子后面坐着一个身材不高的男人，他的头发已经白了，他的眼睛严厉地望着我。
    “你是美国人派来的吗？”他问。
    “不，是我自己要来的。”我回答说，并且哭起来。
    “你不要哭，这里不会难为你的。”
    “我不是为这个哭。”
    “饿了吗？”他问，并且微笑了。
    “是的。”我回答说，也含着眼泪微笑了。
    我已有很久没有吃大米饭了。他们在我面前放了满满一大碗饭。我请求他们允许我带一些到家里去——我的妹妹和弟弟，他们也很久没有吃过饭了。坐在桌子后面的那个人突然背转身去，用手帕揩着自己的眼睛。
    然后，我就和他们谈我们的全部历史。我谈了很久，他们也很注意地听着，没有打断我的话，也没有提问题。说完了，我抬起头来，那个人一直坐在桌子后面，动也不动，他那白发苍苍的头靠在大而强壮的手上。
    “你哭了吗？”我安静地问。
    “没有，我在想，孩子，”他回答说，“我想，敌人带给我们家乡的这一切苦难，他们应该偿付怎样的代价。”他沉默了一会。“不要紧，你就和我们住在一起吧，做我的女儿吧，孩子……。”
    “我还要回到城里去，”我回答说。“我恨他们，我要斗争。”
    “但你想怎样斗争呢？”
    “您读过‘青年近卫军’吗？”我反问他。
    ……一直到早晨，我们都坐在桌子旁边……这里，就在这间小茅屋里，在这微弱的灯光下，制订出将来的斗争计划——“少先近卫队”的活动计划。这个计划的创造者和中心人物就是这坐在桌子后面的白发的老人，——过去是个农民，而现在是劳动党的地下游击队的队长。
    ……我回到城里来了，这时已不像从这里出去时那样，现在我已经扼要的知道了——我应当怎样去进行斗争。
    我决定把自己的计划首先告诉朱黑素——我们少先队的大队指导员。天快黑时我到了她那里，我敲了她的窗子。我走进去时，朱黑素的膝头上搁着一块绣花的东西，好像完全专心在刺绣似的。但在桌上我看到一锭墨和一枝湿着尖子的毛笔。不，朱黑素不会是在作刺绣。
    “我恨美国人，你呢？”我直率地问她。
    “我不明白，”她说，“为什么你想起来告诉我这件事？我可以马上到警察局去告你。”
    我说：“亲爱的朱黑素，我完全明白你，你什么地方也不会去，无论怎样也不会去告发我！你实在是不信任我。”于是我把昨天夜里所发生的一切事情都告诉了朱黑素，我们的“少先近卫队”的事情……朱黑素把刺绣放到旁边去了，我看到在她的膝上正放着一张白色的传单，上面斑斑点点的写着朝鲜文，是一张召唤人们去进行斗争的传单。……
    我们两个人一块去找了所有的我们的最积极的少先队员，并和他们每个人深谈过。我们将来的“少先近卫队”总部就这样组织起来了。
    有一天总部的全体人员都来参加第一次的会议。会议是在一个晚上，在我的小茅屋里开的。我的弟弟英索已经睡了，他的头枕在我的膝上。我们没有点灯，为了不使别人注意我们。寒冷的秋天的月亮从屋顶的漏洞里照了进来，在四周的荒地上寒风正吹扫着干枯的落叶。
    我们围绕成圆圈坐了下来：穆泽苍、康伯波、齐切错、吉翁干、翁免胡、朱黑素和我——七个人，七个总部的人员。我们每个人轮流地站在圆圈中间，用小手电筒照着翻开的“青年近卫军”小说，读着誓词，我们的誓词差不多完全像青年近卫军的誓词那样。
    “我，穆泽苍，参加到‘少先近卫队’队员的行列里，在我的战友们的面前，在祖国的多难的土地面前，在全国人民面前，我庄严地宣誓……。”——沉重地念着游击队的誓词。
    同志们推选我担任队长。穆泽苍被选为副队长。他曾经是我们少先队队委会的主席。“少先近卫队”就这样产生了。
    （四）罢课
    ……在总部的会议上通过了一个决定：在学校里无论用什么代价都要去破坏学习。我们不能容忍那个李承晚派来的教员把法西斯的思想灌入到我们少先队员的头脑里去。我们把城里所有的十三条街分配给总部的队员们，我们每个人要做到使他那条街上的男孩子们和女孩子们都不去上学。我们向孩子们说通了，为什么必须这样做。于是一天天的到学校里上课的学生愈来愈少了。校长想用警察来帮助整顿学校。这时我们就不得不用最后的手段——把学校里的玻璃窗全部打碎。教室里到处通风。甚至穿着大衣还觉得冷。
    但是有一次我们的一个男孩子被捉住了，这个孩子在校长办公室里扣留了很久，直到夜里才回到家来。当时我问他为什么这样久不回来。他骄傲地声明说：
    “他们狠狠地打了我，因为我打碎了玻璃窗。”
    “你承认了吗？”我惊奇地问。
    “少先队员从来不说谎。”
    “对自己同志不应该说谎，”我对他解释说，“而对敌人却必须狡猾。你可以和校长说，因为用棍子打鸟，而误打了玻璃。”
    第二天，二十五个男孩子被捉住了，二十五个人都回答说是因为打鸟而打碎了玻璃。
    学校里的教师用糖果来招待他们，说服他们，又恐吓他们，但是没有一个人说出是谁教他们打玻璃的。
    到了晚上，我问他们：
    “你们为什么不告发我呢？”
    “少先队员是不出卖自己的领袖的。难道我们已经不是少先队员吗？”有一个男孩子惊奇地说。
    “我们永远是少先队员。”我回答说。
    城里有两个学校，罢课运动开始后一个星期，两个学校都关了门。“少先近卫队”开始活动了。
    （五）一天晚上
    在我们城里驻扎着：美军的团部、宪兵司令部、军需处，以及其他的机关，电线像蜘蛛网似的联系着这些机关。
    每天早上，“少先近卫队”总部召集一次会议。有一次的会议上通过了一项决议，去切断美国人的通讯联络。
    同志们委托吉翁干和我去执行这个任务。在一天晚上，我们便出发到美国人的司令部那里去，我们决定切断电线的地方就在这里。美国人恐怕没有想到我们会活动到他们的眼面前来吧。
    进院子的大门旁边站着一个哨兵，街上已经没有人了，吉翁干剪断了一根粗的电线，我从电线里抽出一大段铜丝来，我们又重新把空的电线两头接起来。我们这一切都做得很精确，完全像美国通讯兵做的一样。我甚至还来得及把地上的碎皮线包起来，没有一个人发现我们。
    “现在我们跑吧。”我说。但吉翁干不同意，我们就穿过了街，隐藏在隔壁一家的围墙后面。隔了十五分钟的样子，从美军司令部里走出了两个通讯兵，他们用手电筒正照着我们切断的那一段电线，但是他们什么也没有发现，又往前走了。
    过了半个钟头，通讯兵回到司令部里去了。
    “我们走吧。”我拉着吉翁干。
    这时突然又从司令部里走出了七个通讯兵，推着一卷电线，他们决定换掉所有的电线。直到快正午的时候，他们才最后把线路修理好了。等到天黑了，在同一个地点，用同样的方法，电线又被切断了。
    我们就这样开始和美国的通讯兵进行沉默的斗争，这个斗争一直到解放的一天没有停止过。
    （六）我们有了武器
    我们没有武器，我们决定去得到它。在城外，大的空场上停放着载重汽车，上面盖着油布，车子里放着箱子，里面是炸弹、子弹和地雷。空场子被警戒着。绿色的地面四周是一条被哨兵践踏出来的小路。八个哨兵，每两个哨兵从空场子的两头迎面走来。他们碰头以后再掉转头分开走去。在夜里强烈的探照灯照着这条警戒线。按照穆泽苍建议的计划，我们决定当哨兵碰了头再分开走的时候，穿过警戒线。我们观察到了，他们每二十五分钟碰头一次。恰恰是十二点五十分时，穆泽苍爬过了警戒线，翁免胡和我跟在他后面爬了过去。我尽量地不呼吸……向后看看是可怕的，我好像觉得就会有人厉声地喊：“是谁？”同时哨兵的枪就会响了。但一切都平安地度过了。我爬到了靠边上一辆汽车的大轮子近边，小心地爬进车里去，钻到油布底下。这时我觉得自己很安全了。我上衣的腰带后面有一把钳子，用这个钳子我打开了箱子。啊，就是它，冰冷的子弹。我把子弹装满在短上衣的口袋里，把它们藏在怀里，尽量地拿得多一些。
    突然，我仿佛觉得自己在车子里时间太久了。我们曾经约好，在夜里一点四十分钟，哨兵们又分向两边走开的时候，我们要穿过警戒线。我爬到地上来了。我看了一下四周，很静，没有人。探照灯在照着警戒线，可以很清楚地听到哨兵的沉重的脚步声。没看见那两个男孩子。也许，他们等不到我就走了吧？不，他们不会丢下我的，只有我一个人，是不能通过警戒线的。——穆泽苍的表也许是停了，我躺在地上等着。这时，月亮跑到云彩后面去了，地上完全黑了，我失望地从车上下来，躺在水坑里，我的短上衣都湿透了，我感到冰冷的水。可是，这时我听到沙沙的声音，这是穆泽苍；过了一会又出现了翁免胡。穆泽苍不作声地向着警戒线爬过去，我们跟在他后面爬……
    在早上，在总部的会议上，我们像英雄们一样受着大家的尊敬。穆泽苍拿来了二个反坦克手雷，而翁免胡除了拿了短枪子弹外，还拿来了一个地雷。按照总部的决定，以后每一星期进行两次这样的突击。这样我们就有了武器。
    （七）“同志们，你们自由了！”
    关于妈妈的消息，我们一点也不知道。有好几次我到城里的宪兵司令部去。你知道，每次我们都是多么尽力的准备着送一包珍贵的东西去啊！在一个小包裹里放着很好吃的食物：新鲜的饼子，这是朱黑素烤的；大米饭，这是穆泽苍的妈妈煮的；甚至还有美国的饼干，这是康伯波不知从哪里弄来的。
    我走进了宪兵司令部，排在行列里。但是每次我总是得到一个简短的回答：
    “关于你的妈妈，我们什么也不知道。”
    我慢慢地走回家去，回到我们那个郊外的破烂的小茅屋里……小英索跑来迎接我。并且快乐地喊着：
    “姐姐，你到妈妈那里去了吗？快点给我看看，妈妈送了什么东西来了？”——于是打开了小包裹，英索很有味道地吃完了饼子、大米饭和美国饼干。
    ……一个星期里有两次，星期二和星期六的时候，从城里的监狱里开出一辆“司迪倍克”汽车，里面挤满了人，在车子两边坐着美国的自动枪手们。一星期两次在城外的山谷里他们枪杀着犯人们。
    我们不能平静地看着美国的刽子手们杀害我们的父亲和母亲。我们已经有了一个坚强的、团结一致的组织，我们已有了武器。于是在一次总部的会议上，穆泽苍提议去进攻监狱，把犯人都释放出来。地下党的同志们也赞成我们这样做，并且帮助我们制订了进攻监狱的计划。
    ……在城外，四周围着铁丝网，远远看去，阴森森地立着一个没有窗子的狭窄、阴暗的营房——就是监狱。探照灯照在屋子前面的广场上。在监狱旁边是警卫室。那里面住着警卫。
    夜里一点钟我们爬向铁丝网去……
    美国哨兵站在那里，肩膀靠在墙上，四周是很寂静的……。从厚重的监狱的门后什么地方传送出凄凉的、缓慢的歌声。
    吉翁干从怀里拔出了刀子，朝着哨兵那里爬去，但忽然又爬回来了。
    “穆泽苍，”他激动地低声说，“我不行，我从来没有杀过人。”
    穆泽苍不作声地从他的手里接过了刀子……哨兵甚至都没来得及叫喊一声，他仅仅转动了一下就慢慢地倒在穆泽苍的脚下了。
    我跑向屋子门口，用钳子夹着门上的把手，试图扭转它。门把手却转不动。刚好穆泽苍来帮助了我，——门打开了。
    这时吉翁干和其他的孩子们跟在我们后面来了。他们用木柱子顶住了警卫室的门，那里面是住着警卫的。
    ……我记得我怎样在阴暗的屋子里一步步走进去，又怎样迎面袭来一阵强烈的窒息的气味。
    “同志们！老乡们！出来吧！你们自由了！”我大声地叫着。
    没有一个人出来，屋子里是死一般寂静，这里好像一个人也没有似地。
    “出来吧！”我又叫着。“出来，我们命令你们，我们是游击队员。”
    于是一群影子对着我冲了过来。人们一个跟着一个的从屋子里走出来了。他们不相信就这么自由了，他们哭着又笑着。
    “快，快点，到河边去，现在没有时间道谢啦！”穆泽苍催促着他们。但他们不听他的……
    我站在屋子的门边，注视着沿着我面前走过的妇女的面孔，我在寻找着妈妈。已经走过了很多人了，但所有的人都是陌生的。突然谁抱住了我，我立刻感觉到这是谁，我忽然觉得透不过气来了。
    “妈妈，妈妈！”
    这就是她，我的妈妈。
    ……而在这时在警卫室里的美国兵们用枪柄敲着门，玻璃哗啦啦地打碎了。这时有人用枪柄用力地打，想从窗子上把铁窗栏打落下来。吉翁干跑去拿了根柱子把电线打断了，探照灯熄灭了。这时站在监狱前面空场上的所有的人都跑向铁丝网的门口去……
    “跑呀，同志们！逃呀，同志们！”我听到穆泽苍的声音，他正站在警卫室的铁栏窗子旁边，我看到，他的手飞舞了一下，他把一扎手榴弹扔进去了。
    （八）汽油库爆炸了
    每天地下党的同志们收听广播，听到美国的飞机轰炸我们的城市和乡村的消息。我们把这些消息抄写下来，并把这些传单贴到城里各处。每天，在我们的头上飞着沉重的敌人的“空中堡垒”。下晚时，他们就出动去轰炸，半夜里轰炸了回来。飞机场就在离城不远的地方。
    依照上级同志的指示，我们通过了决议去放火烧美国人的飞机场的汽油。朱黑素、康伯波和我从飞机场的北面爬向汽油库。我们伏在飞机场周围的狭窄的壕沟里。我们必须用自动枪向汽油库开火。我们的计划是这样的：我们用射击吸引他们的注意，美国兵就会向北面跑来，而在这时穆泽苍和别的孩子们就在南面点火烧汽油库。
    ……正是黑暗的十一月的夜晚，下着雪，大片的雪花落在我们的肩上、手上。雪花在脸上融化了，冰冷的雪水流进了衣领里，我的指头都冻僵了。……静静的，我们谁也没有说话的心思，我们在想着我们的孩子们，这时他们正在从南面爬向汽油库去。
    “是时候了。”朱黑素说。我扑到斜坡上去。有什么东西突然碰到我的肩头。自动枪在我手里颤抖着，我看到，从抖着的枪筒里向外喷着火。我的左边和右边都是我们的同志们在射击着。我咬紧了牙齿，在黑暗中射击起来。忽然我听到什么声音，有一个人跑向我们壕沟来了……
    “打枪呀，打呀，你看什么！敌人从背后绕过来了！”康伯波对我叫着。我回过头去看到离我没有几步远的地方出现了一个高大的笨拙的美国兵的影子。我掉转了自动枪，于是一个美国兵挥动着双手倒下去了。
    ……鲜明的火光在我们前面闪耀起来了，火舌升向了天空，从南向北地烧起来了，火焰笼罩了整个汽油库。一个接着一个的巨大的汽油桶都爆炸了。……
    “快，快点！现在我们退却吧！”朱黑素对我喊着。
    我们爬到路上来，向着去城里的方向跑着，在我们的背后是一片熊熊的火海。……
    我们头也不回的顺着路跑着，摔了又爬起来！再向前跑去。我快乐得真想唱歌、跳舞。汽油库烧成灰烬了。
    （九）快乐的时候来了！
    ……快乐的时候来了，——人民军开始进攻了。美国鬼子和李匪军都狼狈地丢弃了城市。我们把路上挖了坑，我们的男孩子们，隐藏在灌木树林里用自动枪射击逃跑的美国鬼子和李匪军。
    康伯波执行着“少先近卫队”总部的最后一次命令，在学校里的花园里挖出我们少先队的旗子，再爬到警钟楼上，把它高高地升起在城市的上空。
    ……我们站在街上，迎着我们走来的是人民军的部队，一连、一营、一团轮流的走过去，坦克轰轰地响着，炮车在高低不平的大路上奔来。女人们奔跑出来迎接战士们，拥抱着我们的解放者，吻着他们，在这庆祝胜利的一天里，人们流着多少快乐的眼泪啊！
    定名为“少先近卫队”的地下的青年的组织，它的活动就这样结束了。我们这样微小的功绩，国家却给了很高的估价。少先近卫队总部的六个同志得了战斗奖章，而我，因为是队长，获得了三级国旗勋章。（陆九如译自苏联“少先真理报”）
