Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th – On the 7th, two U.S. military aircraft once again violated the agreement and flew over the Panmunjom conference area. Just five days prior, U.S. Liaison Officer Colonel Kenney had admitted that three U.S. aircraft had intruded into the conference area airspace on May 23rd. In a memorandum to our side, Kenney, in addition to expressing "regret for the occurrence of this incident," also stated that he would "avoid flying over the conference area."

On the 7th, at around 9:00 AM, security officers from both sides conducted a joint investigation. Our personnel who witnessed the aircraft flying overhead at the time confirmed that the two aircraft were U.S. military aircraft. U.S. duty guard Biggs also confirmed that U.S. aircraft had flown over the conference area. He said: "At around 6:00 AM, two aircraft flew in from between the northern balloon and the eastern balloon and flew away between the western balloon and the southern balloon."

(Note: The conference area is marked by balloons on all four sides.) The U.S. security officer promised to report this violation of the agreement to his superiors.

    美机又侵越板门店会场区
    【新华社开城十日电】七日美方军用飞机两架，又一次违反协议，飞越板门店会场区上空。仅仅距此五天以前，美方联络官肯尼上校曾承认了五月二十三日美机三架侵入会场区上空。肯尼在致我方的备忘录中，除“对此事件的发生表示遗憾”外，并称将“避免对会议区的飞越”。
    七日九时左右，双方安全军官进行了共同调查。当时在场目睹飞机飞越上空的我方人员，证实了那两架飞机是美方军用飞机。美方值勤警备兵勃克斯（BIGGS）也证实了美机曾飞越会场区上空。他说：“六时左右有两架飞机从北边气球与东边气球之间飞来，向西边气球与南边气球之间飞走了。”
    （按：会场区四方都有气球标志）美方安全军官答应将这一违反协议事件报告他的上级。
