    US Steelworkers Continue Strike
    US and Western European War Preparations Affected
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 14th dispatch from Washington] The US steelworkers' general strike, which began on June 2nd, is continuing. The strike is severely hitting US military production and causing economic chaos in the United States. US officials are greatly alarmed by this.
    In view of the serious situation caused by the steelworkers' strike, US President Truman hastily convened a meeting of steel industry owners and union leaders on the 5th, attempting to quickly break the deadlock. However, because the owners continued to refuse to meet the workers' demands, negotiations broke down again on the 10th. Currently, the steel industry strike has greatly affected the nation's railways, mining, shipping, and other related industries. The number of workers laid off in various industries is increasing daily, and now far exceeds 100,000. Detroit's Ford Motor Company announced on the 12th that it would close some of its factories if the strike cannot be resolved in the short term.
    US Secretary of Defense Lovett admitted at a press conference in Washington on the 6th that "the steel strike is a 'very serious blow' to the US arms program." According to his calculations, even if the workers returned to work immediately, "one week of strike plus two weeks of blast furnace start-up time would delay steel production by six million tons this year." He said that the supply of alloys needed for US arms production, especially the manufacture of jet aircraft engines and minesweepers, has been severely affected.
    In order to avoid the depletion of steel stockpiles and the resulting shutdown of domestic arms production, the Truman administration has announced a halt to steel supplies to civilian industries. The US National Production Authority has also decided to assign the most urgent military orders to the few steel plants that are not involved in the strike. However, even Lovett admitted that this "is not a solution, because after the 650,000-member United Steelworkers of America (CIO) went on strike, very few unaffected factories remain."
    The arms expansion plans of Western European countries have also been indirectly affected by the US steelworkers' strike. The Truman administration announced on the 5th that it would ban all steel exports except for steel products "essential" for Western European military production. Lovett admitted that the steel products currently being shipped to Western European countries are being drawn from US "stockpiles," and that when these stockpiles are depleted, Western Europe's arms expansion plans will be even more greatly affected.

### 美钢铁工人继续罢工  美国和西欧备战计划都受到影响

    美钢铁工人继续罢工
    美国和西欧备战计划都受到影响
    【新华社十四日讯】华盛顿消息：六月二日开始的美国钢铁工人大罢工仍在继续进行中。罢工严重地打击着美国军事生产并引起了美国的经济混乱。美国官方已因此而大为恐慌。
    美国总统杜鲁门鉴于钢铁工人罢工所引起的严重局势，在五日急忙召集钢铁业资方和工会领袖举行会谈，企图迅速打开僵局，但是由于资方继续拒绝满足工人的要求，谈判又在十日宣告破裂。目前，钢铁业罢工已使全国铁路、采矿、船舶及其他有关工业受到极大影响。各业停工人数日益增多，现已远超过十万人。底特律福特汽车公司十二日宣布，如果罢工在短期内无法解决，将关闭该公司的若干工厂。
    美国国防部部长罗维特六日在华盛顿记者招待会上承认：“钢铁罢工对于美国军备计划是一个‘很严重的打击’”。根据他的计算，即使工人当时马上复工，“一星期的罢工再加上两个星期的鼓风炉生火的时间，也已要耽误今年钢的生产六百万吨”。他说，目前美国军火生产特别是制造喷气飞机引擎和扫雷艇所需要的合金的供应已受到严重的影响。
    杜鲁门政府为了避免库存钢铁枯竭而引起国内军火生产的停顿，已宣布停止民用工业的钢铁供应。美国全国生产管理局并决定把最紧急的军事定货交给没有卷入罢工的少数钢铁厂制造。但是，连罗维特也承认，这“并不是一个解决办法，因为产联联合钢铁工人工会六十五万人罢工之后，不受影响的工厂已寥寥无几”。
    西欧国家的扩张军备计划也已间接受到了美国钢铁工人罢工的影响。杜鲁门政府五日已宣布除西欧军事生产所“必不可少”的钢产品以外，禁止一切钢产品出口。罗维特承认：目前输送到西欧国家去的钢产品是从美国的“存货”中拨出来的，等到这笔存货耗光时，西欧的扩张军备计划就要受到更大的影响。
