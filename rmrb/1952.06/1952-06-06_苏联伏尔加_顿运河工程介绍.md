    A Soviet Communist construction project, the project to build the Volga-Don Canal and the irrigation systems of the Rostov and Stalingrad regions, is now largely completed. This project is divided into the following three parts: the Volga-Don navigable canal, the Tsimlyansk hydraulic engineering project, and the irrigation system.
    The Volga-Don Navigable Canal was test-navigated on June 1. This canal stretches 101 kilometers from the Red Army City south of Stalingrad on the west bank of the Volga River to the town of Kalach on the east bank of the Don River. The canal passes through the Yergeni Heights, the watershed between the two rivers. The highest point of the highlands is 88 meters above the Volga River and 44 meters above the Don River. The water from the Don River is pumped step by step to the highest point of the watershed through four locks by three huge electric pumping stations, and then flows into the Volga River through nine locks on the Volga side. Each of the three pumping stations that raise the water of the Don River can pump 45 cubic meters of water per second. If the three pumping stations work non-stop for fifteen days and nights, the water in the Suez Canal can be completely pumped dry. After the Volga-Don Canal is opened to navigation, the waterways of the Volga River and the Don River have been connected, opening up waterways between the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the White Sea. All the sea lanes in the European part of the Soviet Union are connected into a single waterway system. The oil from Baku and the grain from Ukraine can be shipped directly to Latvia and Lithuania on the Baltic coast, and the timber from northern Russia and the industrial products from the Urals can also be exchanged. Cargo ship transportation is less costly and has a larger carrying capacity than railway transportation. The opening of the canal will have a great impact on the development of the Soviet national economy.
    The Tsimlyansk hydraulic engineering project includes the construction of "Tsimlyansk Sea," the world's largest artificial reservoir, and the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Station. The "Tsimlyansk Sea" is built on the original channel of the Don River, stretching 180 kilometers from the town of Kalach at the intersection of the Don River and the canal to the village of Tsimlyansk, with a water storage capacity of 12.6 billion cubic meters. The Tsimlyansk Hydropower Station is built on the village of Tsimlyansk, using the water power of the "Tsimlyansk Sea" flowing into the Don River to generate electricity. Now, the construction project of the "Tsimlyansk Sea" has been completed, and ships have been sailing on the "Sea" since June 3. The hydropower station will soon begin generating electricity. After the completion of this project, it will not only improve the Don River channel from the town of Kalach to the city of Rostov, ensuring the water supply of the Volga-Don Canal, but also the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Station, which uses the water power of the "Tsimlyansk Sea" to generate electricity, can generate 160,000 kilowatts, supplying power to the three large pumping stations of the Volga-Don, and will also make it possible to completely electrify the agriculture in the surrounding areas.
    The third part of the project is to establish an irrigation system. The largest irrigation project is the Don Main Canal, which is 190 kilometers long. This main canal is divided into several branch canals, distributing water to 600,000 hectares of land in the Rostov region. In addition, two canals are being dug on the south bank of the canal and west of the "Tsimlyansk Sea" to irrigate 150,000 hectares of land in the southern part of the Stalingrad region. The total length of the main and branch canals of the new irrigation system is 758 kilometers, exceeding the distance from Berlin to Brussels, the capital of Belgium. After the completion of this irrigation system, it will change the natural conditions of this area and fundamentally transform the agriculture of this area. The irrigated area of the irrigation canal, plus the water supply area (supplying water to 1 million hectares of land in each of the Rostov and Stalingrad regions), totals 2.75 million hectares (approximately 41.25 million mu). The first phase of this irrigation system has been completed and is already in use, providing water to 100,000 hectares of dry land.
    The project to build the Volga-Don Canal and the irrigation systems of the Rostov and Stalingrad regions is very vast. According to the plan, the construction of the Volga-Don Navigable Canal and the first phase of irrigation canals alone requires the excavation of 164 million cubic meters of earth, which is more than twice the amount of earth excavated by Germany in fourteen years to build the Kiel Canal. 2.86 million cubic meters of concrete were poured. Now, the main part of this project has been successfully completed. This is the first major victory of the Soviet people in the construction of Communism.

    苏联伏尔加—顿运河工程介绍
    苏联共产主义建设工程之一，兴修伏尔加—顿运河和罗斯多夫及斯大林格勒两州的水利灌溉系统的工程，现在主要部分已经完工了。这个工程分为下列三部分：伏尔加—顿通航运河、齐姆良水利工程、灌溉系统。
    伏尔加—顿通航运河已在六月一日试航，这条运河从伏尔加河西岸斯大林格勒以南的红军城到顿河东岸的卡拉奇镇，长达一百零一公里，运河穿过两河分水岭耶尔根尼高地。高地最高处高出伏尔加河河面八十八公尺，比顿河河面高四十四公尺。顿河河水靠着三个巨大的电力抽水站，经过四道水闸，逐步抽到分水岭的最高点，然后再通过伏尔加河这边的九道水闸流入伏尔加河。使顿河河水升高的三个抽水站，每一个每秒钟能抽水四十五立方公尺，三个抽水站不停工作十五昼夜，可将苏彝士运河的水全部抽干。伏尔加—顿运河通航后，伏尔加河和顿河航路已沟通起来，打通了黑海、亚速海、里海、波罗的海和白海之间的航路。把苏联欧洲部分所有海道联成一个单一水道系统，巴库的石油和乌克兰的粮食可以一直用船舶送到波罗的海海岸的拉脱维亚和立陶宛，俄罗斯北部的木材和乌拉尔的工业品也可交流。货轮运输比铁道运输成本低，运载量也大，运河通航将对苏联国民经济的发展产生极大意义。
    齐姆良水利工程，包括筑一个世界上最大的人工水库“齐姆良海”和齐姆良水电站。“齐姆良海”修在顿河原来的河道上，从顿河与运河交点处的卡拉奇镇到齐姆良村，长一百八十公里，容水量达一百二十六亿公方。齐姆良水电站建在齐姆良村上，利用“齐姆良海”流入顿河的水力发电。现在，“齐姆良海”建筑工程已经完成，船只六月三日起已在“海”上航行。水电站马上就将开始发电。这一工程完工后，不仅改善了自卡拉奇镇到罗斯多夫市的顿河河道，保证伏尔加—顿运河的供水，而且利用“齐姆良海”水力发电的齐姆良水电站能发电十六万瓩，供应伏尔加—顿三个大抽水站的动力，并将使周围地区的农业有可能完全电气化。
    工程的第三部分是建立灌溉系统。最大的灌溉工程是顿河干渠，长一百九十公里。这一干渠又分出几条支渠，分布罗斯多夫州六十万公顷的地区。另外，还在运河南岸和“齐姆良海”之西开凿两条水渠，灌溉斯大林格勒州南部十五万公顷的土地。新灌溉系统的干渠和支渠总长为七百五十八公里，超过从柏林到比利时首都布鲁塞尔的距离。这一灌溉系统完成后，将改变这一地区的自然条件，根本改造这一地区的农业。灌溉渠所灌溉的面积，加上供水面积（供给罗斯多夫和斯大林格勒两州各一百万公顷土地的用水），共计二百七十五万公顷（约合四千一百二十五万市亩）。这个灌溉系统第一批工程已经完成，并已开始使用，使十万公顷的干燥土地得到了水的供应。
    兴修伏尔加—顿运河和罗斯多夫及斯大林格勒两州的灌溉系统的工程是非常浩大的，根据计划，单是为建筑伏尔加—顿通航运河和第一批灌溉渠，就需挖去一亿六千四百万立方公尺泥土，相当于德国开凿基尔运河十四年掘土量的两倍有余。浇灌的混凝土有二百八十六万立方公尺。现在这一工程的主要部分已经胜利完成了，这是苏联人民在共产主义建设工程中的第一个重大胜利。
