    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. TASS reports: The scientific conference held by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of Stalin's famous thesis "On Marxism in Linguistics" continued on the 19th. The distinguished Soviet Orientalist Professor Konrad delivered a report: "Discussing the Chinese Language Question from Stalin's Viewpoint on Linguistics." Konrad emphasized that Stalin's conclusion has promoted the research work of Soviet Sinologists, and this conclusion has proved that Marr's pseudo-scientific theory on the development of certain languages, including Chinese, the so-called "theory of stages of language development," is completely absurd. Professor Konrad, refuting the fabrications of reactionary scientists, pointed out that the development of the Chinese national language is inseparable from the high level of Chinese culture. The Chinese language was, and still is, a very suitable tool to fully express complex human thoughts. In terms of the power and richness of usage, grammatical structure, and basic vocabulary, the Chinese language is one of the most developed languages in the world. This has been reflected in the works of Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong. The power and potential of the Chinese language have also been confirmed by the translations of Lenin and Stalin's works and the translations of world literary classics in Chinese. Konrad pointed out that Soviet Sinologists are conducting many important research works on various issues of the Chinese language.

    苏联东方学家康拉德教授发表报告指出
    中国语言是世界上最发达的语言之一
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院为纪念斯大林著名论文“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”发表两周年而举行的科学会议，十九日继续开会。卓越的苏联东方学家康拉德教授发表了一篇报告：“以斯大林关于语言学的见地来谈中国语言问题”。康拉德强调指出：斯大林所下的结论已促进了苏联汉学家们的研究工作，这个结论已证明：马尔关于包括中国语言在内的某些语言发展问题的伪科学理论——所谓“语言发展阶段论”，是完全荒谬的。康拉德教授在驳斥反动科学家们的杜撰时指出：中国民族语言的发展是与高度的中国文化分不开的，中国语言过去是，现在仍然是足以充分表现复杂的人类思想的十分适当的工具。就用语的力量和丰富性、文法构造和基本词汇而言，中国语言是世界上最发达的语言之一。这一点已反映在孙中山和毛泽东的著作中。中国语言的力量和潜在力，也已由那些用中国语文翻译的列宁和斯大林的著作以及世界文学经典著作的译文加以证实。康拉德指出：苏联汉学家们正在进行许多关于中国语言各种问题的重要研究工作。
