    The People of India and Pakistan Love New China
    Ji Yin
    (I) The Praise and Blessings of Four and a Half Million Spectators
    Our delegation to the Indian International Industrial Exhibition in Mumbai and the Second Pakistan International Industrial Exhibition has successfully completed its mission, returning to the motherland laden with the honor of the nation and the love and sincere friendship of the broad masses of people in India and Pakistan for New China.
    In both the Mumbai and Karachi Industrial Exhibitions, the People's Republic of China pavilion was palace-like, the most eye-catching and beloved pavilion in the entire event. This was not only because the Chinese pavilion's architecture was rich in vibrant national colors, but more importantly, because the over five thousand exhibits vividly displayed the great and astonishing achievements made by the liberated Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in economic construction over the short span of two years, reflecting the happy life of the Chinese people. During the eighty days of exhibition in both countries, the Chinese pavilion attracted people like a magnet, receiving enthusiastic praise and heartfelt blessings from approximately four and a half million spectators.
    Whether in India or Pakistan, there was an atmosphere of genuine friendship and love for New China. Throughout the exhibition, people from different places, different classes, and different professions brought countless praises, eulogies, blessings, admiration, and respect for New China, expressed in various languages and in various ways. When they returned, they spread these sincere feelings of admiration to an even larger group of people.
    (II) Chairman Mao's Image Lights the Way for the Liberation of the Asian People
    Many Indian and Pakistani youths, after seeing the Chinese pavilion, immediately ran to the office to find our staff members, narrating their love for the Chinese people and their leader, Chairman Mao. They eagerly sought to understand everything about New China, asking one question after another, talking tirelessly until midnight. They not only wrote heartfelt blessings in the visitor's book but also enthusiastically left their addresses, eager to make friends with Chinese youths.
    After seeing the Chinese pavilion, many youths requested to go to New China to study. One Indian youth ran to the office for three consecutive days, insisting that we find a way for him to study in China. When we tactfully told him that he should first apply for a passport from the Indian authorities, he hesitated for a moment, and then exclaimed with great emotion, "Mao Zedong, you are like a beacon lighting the way for the liberation of the Asian people. You, a great giant, I will always learn from you!" These words vividly demonstrate the sincere admiration and love of the broad masses of Indian and Pakistani youths for the leader of the New Chinese people.
    (III) The Exchange of Feelings Among the Working People
    The workers were even more filled with love for New China, expressing this love not only in words but also in actions. In Mumbai, many textile workers stood in front of the automatic textile machines displayed in the Chinese pavilion, machines they were most familiar with, reluctantly stroking them and even turning the wheels with their hands. They fell in love with these machines. One worker, while turning the machine with his hand, said, "Touching this machine gives me an indescribable joy. I know this is a machine created by the great Chinese working people for their own enjoyment." In addition, workers from a transportation union, after visiting our pavilion, specially brought a band to play music and present flowers to Chairman Mao. When the wreaths were placed on the snow-white statue of Chairman Mao, the workers' faces showed sincere joy. In Karachi, Pakistani workers also expressed the same feelings. The workers who transported the exhibits for our delegation developed a love for New China during the work process, cherishing the fruits of the Chinese working people's labor as they cherished their own. They not only carefully and cautiously transported each exhibit, but later expressed their determination to work voluntarily for our delegation for two days, in order to express their love for New China. In addition, a spectator signing as "An Ordinary Worker" wrote in the visitor's book: "I would like to represent the Pakistani workers in welcoming the delegation and congratulating Mao Zedong! I sincerely hope that Pakistani workers and Chinese workers will work together to sweep imperialism off the face of the earth. I am very happy to see your progress and believe that exhibitions of this nature will strengthen the unity of the workers."
    (IV) A Poem of Praise for New China
    The love of the literary and art circles of India and Pakistan for New China is also sincere and profound. Many poets and artists wrote words of praise for New China in the visitor's book. Let me copy a Pakistani poet's passionate poem of praise:
    "Ah! Defenders of the East, dazzling people's eyes,
    The night has scarcely passed, in your garden spring is swiftly rising.
    Advance, your young hearts filled with peace,
    You generously give us the spirit of construction,
    You are creating paradise, you have pulled the sun from the clouds."
    This poem cries out the voices of people longing for freedom and happiness. When a small number of members of our delegation visited the ancient cultural city of Lahore, they met many members of the local Pakistan-China Cultural Association, including dancers, musicians, poets, writers, directors, and journalists, all of whom shared the same sentiment—taking pride in being friendly with China. In their conversations, they frequently uttered such blessings: "New China is a symbol of the awakening of the East," "The Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao have created a human miracle," "The Asian people are proud to have New China." Their hearts yearn for New China.
    (V) Indian and Pakistani Businessmen's Eyes Begin to Turn to New China
    Indian and Pakistani businessmen, who have had long dealings with British and American capitalists and tasted enough bitterness, were infinitely surprised and envious of New China's great economic construction achievements in the past two years. For many years, their eyes were turned towards Western countries, and they had fantasized about getting some help from them to develop their own national industries. But facts have proved that what they brought was industrial stagnation and bankruptcy. Today, when they saw various machine tools and precision instruments manufactured in China displayed in the Chinese pavilion, they couldn't help but feel a complex mixture of emotions. An Indian manufacturer, touching the machine exhibited in the Chinese pavilion, said, "The British and Americans don't give us machines, and we can't manufacture them ourselves, so how can industry develop? New China's progress gives us great inspiration. It points out the path we should take." Similarly, a Pakistani businessman once said to the staff of the Chinese pavilion with a wry smile: "Our country is rich in raw cotton and jute, but we don't have a decent textile factory. We have recently built a jute mill, but it cannot be put into operation because the jute weaving machine ordered from the United Kingdom, which was said to be delivered this year, has now been postponed to 1954. This is how Western countries treat us." The rapid development of New China's independent and self-reliant industry made Indian and Pakistani businessmen feel extremely excited and admiring. Today, their eyes are beginning to turn to New China, and they are eager to promote trade relations between China and Pakistan and China and India.
    (VI) Chairman Mao is the Benefactor of Women's Liberation
    The broad masses of women in India and Pakistan felt infinitely envious of the happy lives of the people of New China, especially the women of New China. When they saw the photos of nurseries and kindergartens hanging on the walls of the Chinese pavilion, they constantly exclaimed in praise. An Indian middle-aged woman, while visiting the Chinese pavilion, took my hand and said, "Your New Chinese women are equal to men, this is so fortunate, Mao Zedong is the benefactor of women's liberation. When you go back, please convey my respects to this great giant, and wish him longevity." In Karachi, in order to comply with local customs, the Industrial Exhibition specially arranged a women's day for Muslim women to visit the exhibition once a week. On women's day, the pavilion was crowded with women, all dressed in festive attire, opening the veils that they usually didn't easily take off, and gazing at the various exhibits with infinite surprise and admiration. One day, suddenly a masked woman in black clothes hurriedly pulled one of our female comrades towards the statue of Chairman Mao, saying a series of Urdu words. She saw that our female comrade couldn't understand, and became anxious, and our female comrade was indeed anxious, not knowing what she was saying. Finally, a Chinese interpreter was found, and it turned out that she was saying: "This is your great leader, he has done many things for Chinese women, I bless him!" Then she raised her hand and gave a Muslim salute to the statue of Chairman Mao. Indian and Pakistani women sincerely love Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people.
    (VII) The People of India and Pakistan Yearn for New China
    Today, among the broad masses of people of different faiths, different classes, and different professions in India and Pakistan, there is indeed an atmosphere of eager to understand New China and to be friendly with New China. Wherever you go, you can feel this atmosphere. Because today, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have stood up, are living a free and happy life, and are creating an even better future, how can this not be the most powerful encouragement and the best hope for the people of India and Pakistan? Their eyes are turned towards New China, and their hearts yearn for New China. This is just as Mr. Kalangji, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association in Mumbai, said: "The reason why the broad masses of Indian people have developed a friendly and deep feeling for New China today is because New China has solved the problems we need to solve." This is also as Mr. Shakur, Vice Chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, said: "New China is the fortress of Asian anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism." New China is like the rising red sun, illuminating the vast fields of Asia, making the people living in these fields feel infinite warmth, and they are unanimously cheering and singing for our New China.

    印度和巴基斯坦人民热爱新中国
    吉茵
    （一）四百五十万观众的赞扬与祝福
    我国参加印度孟买国际工业展览会和巴基斯坦第二届国际工业展览会代表团已胜利完成任务，满载着祖国的荣誉和印、巴两国广大人民对新中国的热爱与真诚的友情而回到祖国了。
    在孟买与喀拉蚩工业展览会中的中华人民共和国馆，都是宫殿式的，是大会中最引人注目、最受观众热爱的一个展览馆。这不仅是由于中国馆的建筑富有鲜艳的民族色彩，更重要的是由于馆里陈列着的五千余件展览品，生动地显示了解放了的中国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，短短两年多以来，在经济建设上获得了伟大而惊人的成就，以及从此而反映出来的中国人民幸福的生活。中国馆在两国先后展出八十天中，像磁石一样吸住了人们的心，受到约四百五十万观众的热烈赞扬与衷心祝福。
    无论在印度或巴基斯坦，到处都洋溢着人们对新中国的友好与热爱的真情，在整个展出过程中，每天都有来自不同地方、不同阶层、和不同职业的人们，带来对新中国的无数用各种不同语言与各种不同方式所表达出来的赞美、歌颂、祝福、羡慕和敬意。当他们回去的时候，又把这许多真挚仰慕的心情，传播到更大的人群中去。
    （二）毛主席像明灯一样照亮亚洲人民解放的道路
    很多印度青年与巴基斯坦青年看了中国馆后，马上跑到办公室来找我们的工作人员，叙述他们对中国人民及其领袖毛主席的热爱。他们如饥似渴地要求了解新中国的一切，一个问题紧接着一个问题，谈到午夜不知疲倦。他们在观众意见簿上不仅写下了衷心的祝福，并热情地留下了他们的住址，渴望与中国的青年们交朋友。
    很多青年看了中国馆后，纷纷要求到新中国去学习。有一位印度青年一连三天跑到办公室来坚持要求我们替他想办法去中国学习，当我们婉言告诉他首先要向印度当局申请护照后，他迟疑了一会，然后以十分激动的心情高声说：“毛泽东，你像明灯一样照亮了亚洲人民解放的道路。你，伟大的巨人，我将永远的向你学习！”这些话生动地表明了印巴广大青年对新中国人民领袖的真挚的敬仰与热爱。
    （三）劳动人民感情的交流
    工人们更是对新中国充满了热爱，他们不仅用语言，而且也用行动来表达了这种热爱。在孟买，有很多纺织工人站在中国馆陈列的、他们最熟悉的自动纺织机面前，恋恋不舍地抚摸着它，甚至用手转动起车轮来。他们对这机器发生了爱，有一位工人一面用手转动着机器，一面说：“我摸着这机器有一种说不出的喜悦。我知道这是伟大的中国劳动人民自己所创造、又为自己所享受的机器。”另外有一个运输工会的工人们，在参观我馆后，特地找了乐队吹吹打打地跑到我馆来给毛主席献花。当把鲜花圈戴在雪白的毛主席塑像上时，工人们的脸上都露出了衷心的欢笑。在喀拉蚩，巴基斯坦的工人们也表现了同样的心情。为我国代表团搬运展览品的工人们，在工作过程中对新中国产生了热爱，他们像爱护自己的劳动成果一样，爱护着中国劳动人民创造的成果。他们不仅细心谨慎地搬运着每件展览品，后来并表示坚决要为我国代表团义务工作两天，借以表达他们对新中国的热爱。此外，署名“一普通工人”的观众还在意见簿上写着：“我谨代表巴基斯坦工人欢迎代表团，并向毛泽东祝贺！我非常希望巴基斯坦工人与中国工人一起把帝国主义从地球上清扫掉。我非常高兴见到你们的进步，并相信这样性质的展览会将加强工人们的团结。”
    （四）一首新中国赞美诗
    印、巴两国的文艺界人士对新中国的热爱也是真诚而深切的，很多诗人、艺术家在意见簿上写下了对新中国的赞词。让我抄一个巴基斯坦诗人充满了热情的赞美诗吧：
    “啊！东方的保卫者，眩耀着人们的双眼，
    黑夜过去不久，在你们的花园中很快有了春天。
    前进吧，你们年青的心充满了和平，
    你们充分给予我们建设的精神，
    你们在创造乐园，你们自乌云中拨出了太阳。”
    这首诗喊出了渴望自由幸福的人们的声音。当我国代表团少数人访问文化古城拉合尔时，见到当地巴中文化协会的很多会员，包括舞蹈家、音乐家、诗人、作家、导演和记者等，他们都怀着同样的心情——以与中国友好为荣。在他们的谈话中，经常发出这样的祝语：“新中国是东方觉悟的标志”、“毛主席领导下的中国人民创造了人类的奇迹”、“亚洲人民以有新中国为荣”。他们的心是向往着新中国的。
    （五）印、巴工商界人士的眼睛开始转向新中国
    跟英美资本家有过长期交道并尝够辛酸滋味的印、巴两国工商界人士，对新中国两年多来的伟大经济建设成就，感到无限惊奇与羡慕。多少年来他们的眼睛是朝着西方国家的，他们曾幻想从它们那里得到一些帮助，借以发展自己的民族工业。但事实证明：带给他们的是工业的停滞与破产。今天当他们看到中国馆陈列着自己制造的各种工作母机及精密仪器时，他们不禁感慨丛生。一个印度制造商抚着中国馆展览的机器说：“英美不给我们机器，我们自己又不能制造机器，工业如何能发展呢？新中国的进步给我们很大的启示。这指出了我们应走的道路。”同样一位巴基斯坦商人曾苦笑着对中国馆的工作人员说：“我们国家盛产原棉与黄麻，但是我们没有一个像样的纺织厂。我们最近已建好一所麻纺织厂，但不能开工，原因是向英国订购的麻织机，本来说今年交货，现在又要延至一九五四年才交货。西方国家就是这样对待我们的。”新中国独立自主的工业的迅速发展，使印、巴两国的工商界人士感到极大的兴奋、感到欣慕。今天他们的眼睛开始转向新中国，他们渴望着促进中巴和中印间的贸易关系。
    （六）毛主席是妇女解放的恩人
    广大的印、巴两国妇女，对新中国人民、特别是新中国妇女愉快而幸福的生活，感到无限羡慕。当他们看到中国馆墙上挂的托儿所、保育院的照片时，她们不断地发出赞美声。一位印度中年妇人参观中国馆时拉着我的手说：“你们新中国妇女跟男子一样平等，这太幸福了，毛泽东是妇女解放的恩人。你回去后，请你代我向这伟大的巨人致敬，并祝他万寿无疆。”在喀拉蚩，为遵守当地风俗习惯，工业展览会特为回教妇女每周安排一天妇女参观日。在妇女日那一天，馆里挤满了妇女，她们都穿着节日的盛装，打开了平素不轻易取下的面罩，以无限惊奇与欣慕的心情，凝视着各种展览品。有一天，忽然一位穿黑色衣服的蒙面的妇女，拉着我们一位女同志匆匆地走向毛主席塑像，嘴里说着一连串的回语。她看到我们那位女同志听不懂，急了，我们那女同志也确实急了，不知她说些什么，最后找到了一位华侨翻译，原来她是说：“这是你们伟大的领袖，他为中国妇女作了很多事情，我祝福他！”然后她又举起手来向毛主席塑像行了一个回教礼。印、巴妇女就是这样真诚地热爱着中国人民的领袖毛主席。
    （七）印、巴两国人民向往着新中国
    今天，在印、巴两国的不同信仰，不同阶层，不同职业的广大人士中，的确存在着一种渴望了解新中国、与新中国友好的气氛，无论你走到那里，你都可以感到这种气氛。因为今天，中国人民在毛主席的领导下翻了身，过着自由幸福的生活，而且正创造着更美好的将来，这对于印、巴两国人民说来，怎能不是最有力的鼓舞和最好的希望呢？他们的眼睛朝向新中国，他们的心向往着新中国。这正如孟买印中友好协会主席卡朗吉所说的：“今天广大的印度人民之所以对新中国产生了一种友好的深厚的感情，这是因为新中国已经解决了我们要解决的问题。”这也正如巴中友好协会副主席霞库尔所说的：“新中国是亚洲反帝国主义、反殖民制度的堡垒。”新中国正像东升的红日，照耀着亚洲广大的原野，使生活在这原野上的人们，都感到无限温暖，他们一致地为我们新中国而欢呼歌唱。（新华社）
