Xinhua News Agency, 7th. People from all circles in Beijing held a rally tonight to support the French people's movement to defend peace and protest against the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos. The meeting was jointly hosted by the General Council of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Beijing Branch. More than 6,000 people, including workers, women, students, cultural, scientific, industrial, and commercial figures, and staff from government departments in the capital, attended the meeting.

The meeting began with an opening speech by Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. He said that the protest movement launched by the French people against Ridgway, the executioner who massacred the Korean people and the American germ warfare criminal, upon his arrival in Paris, is a just action and has been warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The French government, acting on the orders of the American imperialists, has ordered the illegal arrest of Duclos, leader of the French people, and Stieglitz, editor-in-chief of "L'Humanité," and thousands of others, using fascist methods, and has extensively searched the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and other democratic groups. This atrocity by the traitorous French government is a provocation to the French people. The purpose of our meeting is to express our Chinese people's, Beijing people's, warm support for the French people's patriotic movement, and also to express our angry protest against the French government.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in his speech, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, expressed warm sympathy and support for the French people's patriotic movement to fight for independence and defend peace; and lodged a serious protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the French Pinay government at the instigation of American imperialism. Guo Moruo pointed out that after the Second World War, the reactionary rulers of France, against the will of the French people, made France a dependency of the United States, causing great disasters to the French people. While American imperialism is re-militarizing Japan, it is also stepping up the arming of West Germany in the West, making it the main force of the invading army in Western Europe. Under such circumstances, the French people are facing a serious threat of a new war. The French people's struggle to defend their independence, peace, and democracy, and to oppose the stationing of germ warfare criminal Ridgway in Paris to implement the war policy of American imperialism, is a completely reasonable and just action. Any government that adopts fascist means is only following the old path taken by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Guo Moruo concluded by saying: We firmly believe that the outstanding sons and daughters of the French people, who have a glorious historical tradition, with the warm support of the people all over the world, and in the united struggle of carrying forward patriotism, will surely defeat the invaders, defeat the tyrants, and defeat all enemies of peace.

After Guo Moruo's speech, representatives of various national people's organizations and Beijing people's organizations spoke successively.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech: The Chinese working class is extremely indignant at the bloody atrocities of the French government. The Chinese working class believes that this is a serious crime by the French government, under the instructions of its master, the American aggressor, to systematically harm the French Communist Party, the French working class, and the French people, and to undermine and stifle the cause of peace. The Chinese working class expresses its firm protest against this crime! The Chinese working class firmly supports the French people's just struggle for independence and defense of peace! Firmly support the just action of the French people demanding the immediate release of Comrade Duclos and other patriots!

Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in her speech, on behalf of all Chinese women, paid the highest tribute to Duclos, the leader of the French people who opposed the American executioner Ridgway. She described Ridgway's heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare and massacring people in Korea and Northeast China. She said that the people of the world are one family, and since the Chinese and Korean people cannot tolerate this executioner's crimes in Korea, the French people cannot tolerate this executioner going to France to implement the American aggressors' war policy and slaughtering the people of Europe. We Chinese women, together with all the Chinese people, support the French people's struggle to restore Duclos' freedom.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, said in his speech: The youth of the whole country, together with the 500 million people of China, will use combat power to support the just struggle of the French people and the French youth. The human executioner and germ warfare criminal Ridgway's aggressive actions in Korea have been crushed by the heroic Chinese and Korean people. Now he attempts to strangle the French and European people with his blood-stained hands. But the French people have a glorious tradition of heroic struggle, a glorious French Communist Party, the Republican Youth League of France, and thousands upon thousands of peace fighters. They will certainly liberate France from the bloody rule of American imperialism and French reactionaries and establish an independent and free France. Liao Chengzhi finally pointed out: In order to support the French people, we must work harder, step up production, and further strengthen the struggle against American aggression and for the defense of peace.

Shu Sheyu, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said in his speech that all comrades of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles felt very angry about the atrocity of illegally arresting Duclos, the leader of the French people, and demanded his immediate release. He said that the French people hate Ridgway because this universally hated executioner and germ warfare criminal is about to implement the American imperialists' criminal plan to prepare for war in Western Europe. Shu Sheyu finally shouted: Down with the germ warfare criminal Ridgway! Long live the French people who are fighting for peace and defending France!

Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, said in his speech: Chinese scientific workers have personally investigated the evidence of Ridgway's germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The French people, under the call of their leader Duclos, are completely justified in protesting against the arrival of this disaster messenger in France. Chinese scientific workers engaged in peaceful construction resolutely protest against the illegal arrest of Duclos by the French Pinay government!

Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, stated in his speech the unparalleled anger of the Beijing industrial and commercial circles towards the fascist atrocities of the French Pinay government, and expressed full sympathy and full support for the patriotic struggle of the French people.

During the meeting, the entire audience was in high spirits, constantly shouting slogans such as "Down with the germ warfare criminal Ridgway!" "Support the patriotic movement of the French people!" "Demand that the French government immediately release Duclos!" and "Oppose aggressive war and defend world peace!"

Finally, the meeting unanimously passed two telegrams to support the French people's patriotic movement and protest against the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos.

    北京市各界人民举行大会
    声援法国人民爱国运动抗议法政府逮捕杜克洛
    郭沫若代表全国人民抗议法国政府暴行
    【新华社七日讯】北京市各界人民七日晚举行声援法国人民保卫和平运动、抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛大会。大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会总会及北京市分会联合主持，参加大会的有首都工人、妇女、学生和文化、科学、工商界人士及机关工作人员共六千多人。
    大会首由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会主席张奚若致开会词。他说，法国人民所发动的反对屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手、美国细菌战罪犯李奇微到达巴黎的抗议运动，是正义的行动，受到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。法国政府仰承美帝国主义者的鼻息，竟然下令用法西斯手段非法逮捕法国人民领袖杜克洛和“人道报”总编辑斯梯等上千人，并大事搜查法国共产党中央委员会及其他民主团体。法国卖国政府的这种暴行是对法国人民的挑衅。我们开会的目的，就是要表示我们中国人民、北京市人民对法国人民爱国运动的热烈支持，同时也是对法国政府的愤怒抗议。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在讲话中代表全中国人民对法国人民争取独立与保卫和平的爱国运动表示热烈的同情与支持；对法国比内政府在美帝国主义唆使下所进行的法西斯暴行，提出严重的抗议。郭沫若指出：在第二次世界大战后法国反动统治者违反法国人民的意志，使法国沦为美国的附属国，使法国人民遭受巨大的灾难。美帝国主义与使日本重新军国主义化的同时，又在西方加紧武装西德，使其成为西欧侵略军的主力。在这种情况下，法国人民面临着严重的新战争的威胁。法国人民为了保卫独立、和平、民主，奋起反对细菌战犯李奇微驻扎巴黎去执行美帝国主义的战争政策，是完全合理的正义行动。采取法西斯手段的任何政府，只是走着蒋介石匪帮所走过的老路而已。郭沫若最后说：我们坚决相信：具有光荣历史传统的法兰西人民的优秀儿女，在全世界人民的热烈支援下，在发扬爱国主义的团结斗争中，一定能战胜侵略者、战胜暴君、战胜一切和平的敌人。
    郭沫若讲话后，出席大会的各全国性人民团体和北京市人民团体的代表相继发言。
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范在讲话中说：中国工人阶级对于法国政府的血腥暴行，异常愤慨。中国工人阶级认为这是法国政府在它的主子美国侵略者的指使下有计划地谋害法国共产党、法国工人阶级和法国人民，并且破坏和扼杀和平事业的严重罪恶行为。中国工人阶级对于这种罪行表示坚决的抗议！中国工人阶级坚决声援法国人民争取独立、保卫和平的正义斗争！坚决声援法国人民要求立即释放杜克洛同志及其他爱国者的正义行动！
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全在讲话中代表全中国妇女对领导法国人民反对美国刽子手李奇微的法国人民领袖杜克洛致最崇高的敬礼。她叙述了李奇微在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战、屠杀人民的滔天罪行。她说，世界人民是一家，中朝人民既然不能容忍这个刽子手在朝鲜的罪行；同样，法国人民也不能容忍这个刽子手到法国去执行美国侵略者的战争政策，大肆屠杀欧洲人民。我们中国妇女，和全中国人民一道，支持法国人民要求恢复杜克洛自由的斗争。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志在讲话中说：全国青年跟全中国五亿人民一齐以战斗的力量来支援法国人民和法国青年的正义斗争。人类刽子手和细菌战罪犯李奇微在朝鲜的一切侵略行动，已经为英勇的中朝人民所粉碎，现在他又企图以染满了鲜血的双手来扼杀法国和欧洲人民，但是法国人民有英勇斗争的光荣传统，有光荣的法国共产党、法兰西共和青年联盟和千千万万的和平战士，他们一定会把法国从美帝国主义和法国反动派的血腥统治下解放出来，建立独立自由的法兰西。廖承志最后指出：为了支援法国人民，我们更要努力工作、加紧生产、进一步加强抗美援朝和保卫和平的斗争。
    北京市文学艺术界联合会主席舒舍予在讲话中说，北京市文联全体同志对于非法逮捕法国人民领袖杜克洛的暴行，感到非常愤怒，并要求立即释放杜克洛。他说，法国人民仇恨李奇微，因为这个举世痛恨的刽子手和细菌战罪犯又要在西欧执行美帝国主义准备战争的罪恶计划。舒舍予最后高呼：打倒细菌战犯李奇微！为和平与保卫法兰西而奋斗的法国人民万岁！
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希在讲话中说：中国科学工作者曾亲身调查过李奇微在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的罪证。法国人民在他们的领袖杜克洛号召之下，抗议这个灾难使者到达法国，是完全正当的。从事和平建设的中国科学工作者坚决地抗议法国比内政府非法逮捕杜克洛的暴行！
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭在讲话中陈述了北京市工商界对于法国比内政府的法西斯暴行的无比愤怒，并表示完全同情和全力支援法国人民的爱国斗争。
    大会进行过程中，全体到会群众情绪激昂，不断高呼“打倒细菌战罪犯李奇微！”“声援法国人民的爱国运动！”“要求法国政府立即释放杜克洛！”
    “反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平！”等口号。
    大会最后一致通过声援法国人民爱国运动和抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛的两项电文。
