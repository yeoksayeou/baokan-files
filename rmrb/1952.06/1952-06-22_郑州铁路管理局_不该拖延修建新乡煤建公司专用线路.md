    Zhengzhou Railway Bureau
    Should Not Delay Constructing the Xinxiang Coal Construction Company's Dedicated Line
    Comrade Editor: The Xinxiang branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, in order to reduce commodity circulation costs, has requested instructions from higher authorities and received approval to construct a dedicated line of 780 meters connecting Xinxiang Station directly to the Youjiafen Coal and Timber Yard. The required construction cost of 2.8 billion yuan (including 800 million yuan for the Anyang dedicated line) was paid to the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau on November 11th last year. The line was originally scheduled to begin construction in December. Later, someone from the Ministry of Railways suggested that the construction of this dedicated line might affect the location of the railway station in Xinxiang's municipal construction plan; therefore, this dedicated line could not be built. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau listened to this opinion and stopped construction. However, according to the company's understanding, Xinxiang's municipal construction plan cannot be realized within four or five years, while this dedicated line is a realistic problem that must be solved (the annual savings in handling fees after using the dedicated line would be enough to cover the entire construction cost). After repeated consultations with the Railway Bureau, they began surveying the route; later, due to the start of the "Three-Anti" campaign, it was delayed until today and has still not started construction. Currently, every time the Xinxiang Coal Construction Company receives goods, they must be unloaded at Xinxiang Station and then moved into the yard. It is estimated that the handling fee per ton of goods is 13.5 jin of millet more than it would cost after the dedicated line is completed; from January to April this year, a total of 88,460 tons of coal, timber, cement, etc., were transported, wasting more than 1 million jin of millet. The capital turnover and interest losses of the 2.8 billion yuan construction fee paid to the Railway Bureau have not yet been calculated. This loss is enormous. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau should start construction quickly and compensate the Coal Construction Company for its losses.

### 郑州铁路管理局  不该拖延修建新乡煤建公司专用线路

    郑州铁路管理局
    不该拖延修建新乡煤建公司专用线路
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司新乡分公司为了减低商品流转费用，已向上级请示，并经批准，从新乡车站接修专用线七百八十公尺，直达游家坟煤木场内。所需修建费二十八亿元（内有安阳修专用线款八亿元），已经在去年十一月十一日付给郑州铁路管理局。该线原规定十二月动工。后来铁道部有人提出，修建这条专用线，可能影响新乡市政建设计划中的铁路车站位置，因此，不能修筑这条专用线。郑州铁路管理局听了这个意见，就停止开工。但据公司了解，新乡市政建设计划四五年内不能实现，而该专用线却是必须解决的现实问题（使用该专用线后，每年节省的搬运费，足够全部修建费）。经与铁路管理局再三商洽，才开始测量路线；后又因“三反”开始，拖延至今日仍没开工。现在新乡煤建公司每次来货，必须在新乡车站上卸车，再搬进场去。估计每吨货物的搬运费，要比修妥专用线以后多花十三斤半小米；今年一至四月间共搬运煤炭、木材、洋灰等八万八千四百六十吨，就浪费小米一百多万斤。至于交付铁路管理局的二十八亿元修建费的资金周转及利息损失，还没有计算在内。这个损失是巨大的。郑州铁路管理局应赶快动工，并赔偿煤建公司损失。　新华来
