Editor's Note: The Union of Art and Theater Workers of Bulgaria sent a letter to Chinese theater workers before the "May Day" holiday to express their respect. The Japanese "Progressive Theater Group" also wrote a letter to Chinese workers and peasants on "May Day" to congratulate them. From these two letters (forwarded by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, received later), we can see that artists from various countries with different social systems share a common and enthusiastic desire to enhance peace, friendship, and cultural exchange between the people of all countries.

Letter from the Bulgarian Union of Art and Theater Workers to the All-China Association of Theater Workers

Dear Comrades:

On the occasion of the international "May Day" Labor Day, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian People's Republic Union of Art and Theater Workers extends to you our warm greetings.

We wish that the friendship between art workers of the people's democratic brother countries led by the great Soviet Union, the strong fortress of world peace, will continue to strengthen and consolidate.

Long live "May Day"!

Chairman: P. Dimitrov (People's Artist)
Secretary: G. Markov

Letter from the Japanese "Progressive Theater Group"

To the worker and peasant brothers of the People's Republic of China:

We extend our congratulations to you for the brilliant achievements you have made in building the New China and for the "May Day" celebration held in Beijing.

Although we are unable to go to China at your invitation due to the persecution of the Yoshida traitorous government, we believe that the songs of Japanese workers and peasants who desire world peace, and your songs from across the distant sea, will resound throughout the world.

Our "Progressive Theater Group" has been fighting for twenty-two years to defend and develop Japanese national drama and film. In order to crush the conspiracies to provoke war and the decadent culture of colonialism, we are now divided into three acting groups, performing in rotation in cities and villages throughout Japan. In the field of film, we have worked with the masses to produce "No! We Want to Live" and "Hakone Scenery," which have achieved great success.

However, the democratic forces in Japan are still very weak. Our country is being used as a foreign military base, and the struggle for the liberation of Japan will become increasingly fierce.

We take the beautiful life you are building as the goal of our efforts. We vow that we will soon build a happy Japan, freely interact with you, and resolutely defend world peace. On the occasion of "May Day" Labor Day, we wholeheartedly extend our congratulations to you with this vow!

Long live the unity of workers and peasants of all China!
Long live the friendship between China and Japan!
Long live the development of Chinese drama and film!
Long live Labor Day of 1952!
Long live the Communist Party of China!

Representative of the Progressive Theater Group: Kawarasaki Chojuro

    加利亚和日本的艺术戏剧工作者
    给我国工人、农民及艺术工作者的信
    编者按：保加利亚艺术戏剧工作者工会在“五一”节前夕来信向我国戏剧工作者致敬。日本“前进剧团”也在“五一”节写信向我国工人、农民祝贺。从这两封信（由中华全国总工会转来，收到较迟）里，可以看到在社会制度不同的各国艺术家对于增进各国人民之间的和平友好与文化交流都具有共同的热烈愿望。保加利亚艺术戏剧工作者工会给中华全国戏剧工作者协会的信亲爱的同志们：
    值此国际“五一”劳动节，保加利亚人民共和国艺术戏剧工作者工会中央委员会谨向你们致以亲切的敬礼。
    祝世界和平坚强的堡垒伟大的苏联领导的人民民主兄弟国家的艺术工作者之间的友谊不断地加强与巩固。
    “五一”节万岁！
    主席帕·季米特洛夫（人民艺术家）
    书记格·马尔考夫
    一九五二年四月二十八日
    日本“前进剧团”的来信中华人民共和国的工人、农民兄弟们：
    我们对你们在建设新中国所获得的辉煌成绩和在北京召开的“五一”庆祝大会，致以庆贺。
    虽然我们由于吉田卖国政府的迫害，不能应你们的邀请前往中国，但我们相信，愿望世界和平的全日本工人和农民的歌声，和遥远隔着大海的你们的歌声，会响彻全世界的。
    我们“前进剧团”，为了保卫和发展日本民族的戏剧和电影，至今一直斗争了二十二年。为了粉碎挑拨战争的阴谋和殖民地的堕落文化，现在我们分为三个演剧班，在日本全国的都市和农村轮流演出。在电影方面，我们和群众一起，摄制了“不！我们要活下去”和“箱根风云录”，获得了巨大的成绩。
    然而，日本的民主力量现在还很弱，我们的国土被作为外国的军事基地，争取日本解放的斗争会愈来愈激烈的。
    我们把你们所建设的美好生活作为我们努力的目标。我们宣誓：我们不久就要建设幸福的日本，自由地和你们来往，坚决保卫世界和平。当“五一”劳动节之际，我们以这个宣誓，衷心向你们致贺！
    全中国的工农团结万岁！
    中国与日本的友好万岁！
    中国的戏剧和电影界的发展万岁！
    一九五二年的劳动节万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    前进剧团代表河原崎长十郎
    一九五二年五月一日
