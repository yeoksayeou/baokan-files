    A French Woman's Impressions of China
    France Gé Lái·Luó Ā

    So-called youth is not a matter of age. For many years, we European primary school students have heard about ancient China, but our understanding of this ancient China is still very superficial. We only heard the clergy say: "The Chinese are barbaric because they have not been baptized. They worship the Bodhisattvas in ancient temples. There are officials and monks. Gunpowder was invented hundreds of years before the birth of Jesus. Floods often occur, which is a punishment from heaven. The emperors enjoy themselves in the Arabian Nights-like magnificent palaces." When we were twelve years old, we were stuffed with many stories of ancient Greek heroes and some myths; we also learned about the life of Egyptian farmers three thousand years ago, how to build fossils into specimens of ancient organisms, and flying dragons from the prehistoric era. However, the names of any Chinese emperors, poets, and heroes have never been told to us. We only know that when the entire West was still in a barbaric era, China was already an ancient civilized country.

    This time, I saw China's ancient culture with my own eyes. Those palaces, temples, mausoleums, and Tang Dynasty statues similar to the Danaïdes of Greece, and copies of the Dunhuang murals painted before Giotto was born. These murals were painted before the ancient paintings of Siena, Italy, and are extraordinarily similar. I also saw the rural areas with light black soil, described in paintings from more than a thousand years ago, the smoke and mist in the faint sunlight, and the delicate and verdant young leaves. However, after a month's stay in China, what surprised me was not the old culture of ancient China and those rare antiques, but the great youth of China.

    After eight days of travel, when I got off the plane, my first contact with China was that group of Young Pioneers who made me feel warm. They smiled and presented us with flowers. Mr. Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, although his beard is white, looks as young as the members of the Young Pioneers.

    We visited many places in China and saw the vision of China's future. In a palace in Beihai Park, where the empress used to raise silkworms, it has now become a place for children. A ten-year-old little poet from Beijing Primary School recited to us the poem he wrote praising May Day. In a rural primary school near Beijing, many boys and girls were performing Yangko dances in the courtyard of a temple. In a park in Hangzhou, young little botanists happily showed us their trophies—a jade-like translucent beetle. Everywhere we heard the laughter of children. Their laughter is like the sound of liberation bells, like the ranks of young people who marched in front of Chairman Mao on May Day, enthusiastically cheering, and like the surging red flags and flowers. One day, when I visited a yarn factory in Shanghai, I walked into the factory's nursery, where more than a hundred babies were sleeping peacefully. With the consent of the mothers, I woke up a few of them. Female workers in French yarn factories cannot work if they have children because there are no nurseries to allow them to work with peace of mind.

    China's youth is not only reflected in the confident and enthusiastically studying young people. In ancient China, everyone seems young. Old cadres are taking on a new struggle again, but this time it is a struggle for peace. Many old professors participated in land reform, and they mingled with students and young intellectuals. They lived the hard life of farmers. During spring plowing and autumn harvest, they helped farmers work, organized night schools and winter schools, and led illiterate people to learn. This destroyed the barriers placed by the ruling classes in capitalist and feudal countries between intellectuals and rural people, and between workers and farmers. Chinese workers are full of vigor, and their enthusiasm for work makes them lively, resourceful, and powerful; able to improve their machines, improve work efficiency, and increase output. The workers who manufacture locomotives in the Sifang Railway Factory are also so young, and in eighteen days, they increased their labor by 20,000 hours. They transformed an unusable locomotive into a new one, named it "Sino-Soviet Friendship," and drove it to Beijing.

    It is best to go to various places in Beijing on Sundays. From Renmin University, you can see the whole city's enthusiasm for learning. In the countryside at night, drum sounds can be heard faintly under the blue sky. We saw young people and old people talking and laughing, discussing wall newspapers. When we strolled on the streets of large and small cities, we could find many bookstores, and we could see from the snow-white walls that these bookstores had only been opened in the past year or two. Inside, those young and old readers, although they rarely buy books, are reading with their hands full. At the Beijing Central Academy of Fine Arts student works exhibition, we saw hundreds of paintings of the Huai River project that they brought back after living on both sides of the Huai River for several months. The Huai River, one of the largest rivers in the world, used to flood year after year, often drowning people and livestock, and entire villages were swept away by the waves. This is what the clergy called "punishment from heaven." But now someone has come, these people do not believe in fate or destiny, they are young people, holding hoes and shovels in their hands, they are building many sluices on the Huai River, conquering this river, and turning land equivalent to a quarter of the French territory into fertile farmland. They are a group of gardeners with a bright future, they will turn the desert into fertile land, they are planting hope and confidence for the young people of ancient China. French Communist Party member Vaillant-Couturier once said: "Communism is the youth of the world." These young people of ancient China, that is, the young people of New China, will erect a new youth in the world. I proudly pay tribute to the future youth of the world from Beijing.

    一位法国女子对中国的观感
    法国  格莱·罗阿
    所谓青春，并不是一个年龄的问题。多少年来，我们欧洲的小学生，也听到过关于古老的中国的谈论，其实我们对这古老的中国的认识，还是非常肤浅。仅仅听到些教士们的说法：“中国人是野蛮的，因为他们没有受过洗礼。他们参拜古庙里的菩萨。有官老爷，有和尚。在耶稣降生前几百年，就发明了火药。常发水灾，那是上天降罚。帝王们却在天方夜谭中金碧辉煌的皇宫里享福。”我们十二岁的时候就硬灌进了许多古希腊的英雄故事和一些神话；也学过一些三千年前埃及农民的生活，怎样从化石搭成古生物的标本、洪荒时代的飞龙。可是任何一个中国的帝王、诗人和英雄的姓名，却从来没有告诉过我们。仅仅知道当整个西方还在野蛮时代，而中国已是一个文明的古国了。
    我这次亲眼看见了中国的古老文化。那些宫殿、庙宇、陵寝和希腊的丹奈格相类似的唐代塑像，在希阿多没有出生以前的敦煌壁画的描本。这些壁画，在意大利西恩奈古画以前就绘好了，而且异常相像。我也看见了像一千多年以前的画上所描写的浅黑色土壤的农村，淡日下的烟岚，娇翠的嫩叶。然而，经过在中国一月的勾留，使我感到惊奇的，并不是古老中国的旧文化和那些稀奇的古玩，而是中国的伟大的青春。
    经过八天的旅行，当我下飞机的时候，第一次和中国的接触，就是使我感觉到温暖的那一群少年儿童队。她们笑容满面地向我们献花。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通先生，虽然长须已白，然而看起来却和少年儿童队队员一样的年轻。
    我们参观了中国的许多地方，看到了中国未来的远景。在北海公园一座宫殿里面，当年是皇后养蚕的所在，现在却变成了儿童们的地方。北京小学有一个十岁的小诗人，向我们朗诵了他写的歌颂五一节的诗篇。在北京近郊一个乡村小学里面，许多男女孩童在一座庙宇的院子里扭着秧歌。在杭州的公园里，年轻的小植物学家高兴地把他们的战利品—一个像玉一样半透明的甲壳虫，给我们看。到处都听到儿童的欢笑声。他们的欢笑，像解放的钟声，像五一节的那天，在毛主席面前游行着的、热烈欢呼的青年行列，也像潮水一般起伏动荡的红旗和鲜花。有一天，当我参观上海一家纱厂的时候，走进了工厂附设的托儿所，那里正安睡着一百多个婴儿。征得母亲们的同意后，我唤醒了其中的几个。法国纱厂里的女工，有了孩子就无法工作，因为没有托儿所使她们可以安心工作。
    中国的青春，不仅表现在有信心而热烈学习的青年们的身上。在古老的中国，人人都显得年轻。老干部们重新担负起一个新的斗争，可是这次是和平斗争。许多老教授参加了土地改革，他们和学生、青年知识分子打成一片。他们过着农民的艰苦生活。春耕和秋收的时候，他们帮助农民工作，组织夜校和冬学，领导不识字的人进行学习。这就摧毁了资本主义和封建主义国家里面的统治阶级放在知识分子和乡下人之间、工人和农民之间的那些障碍物。中国的工人充满着朝气，他们对工作的热情使他们活泼、机智而有力量；能够改良他们的机器，改进工作效率，增加产量。在四方铁路工厂里的制造机车的工人，也是那样的年轻，在十八天的当中，就增加了两万个小时的劳动。他们把一座不堪使用的火车头改装成一座新的，命名“中苏友好号”，并且把它开到北京。
    最好是礼拜日到北京各处看看。从人民大学可以看出来全城人民学习的热潮。夜里的乡村，那蓝色天空下面，远远响起鼓声。我们看到青年们、老年们谈笑着，讨论着壁报。当我们在大小城市的街道上蹓跶的时候，我们可以发现许多书店，从那些雪白的墙可以看出这些书店是仅仅一两年来才开设的。里面那些青年和老年的读者，虽然他们买书的时候很少，然而都是手不释卷地阅读着。在北京中央美术学院学生作品展览会上，我们看到他们在淮河两岸住了几个月带回来数百幅淮河工程的描绘。这条世上最大河流之一的淮河，过去年年泛滥成灾，常常淹没人畜，整个的村庄为波涛卷去。这就是如同教士们所说的“上天降罚”了。然而现在有人来了，这些人不相信什么孽数，什么命里注定，他们是年轻的人，手里拿着锄头和铁铲，他们在修筑淮河上许多的水闸，征服了这条河流，使相当于法国国土四分之一的土地，变为肥沃的农田。他们是一群有光明前途的园丁，他们将使沙漠成为肥沃的土地，他们是这样地为古老的中国青年人民种下了希望和信心。法国共产党党员瓦扬·古久里曾经说过：“共产主义是世界的青春。”这些古老的中国的青年们，也就是新中国的青年们，他们将在世界上树起新的青春。我骄傲地从北京向全球未来的青春致敬。
