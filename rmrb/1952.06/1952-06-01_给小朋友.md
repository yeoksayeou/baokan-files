    To the Children
    Yu Zhi
    Mao Zedong's sunshine shines in all directions, and the motherland's land exudes fragrance. You grow freely here, you sing happily here. Your parents sweat profusely, building spacious houses for you; the Volunteer Army uncles are fighting in Korea, protecting you from harm. Countless treasures buried underground are waiting for you to mine them as much as possible; that boundless field will be the sea for your tractors to navigate. The cause of liberating all mankind will be continued by you. You will join brothers and sisters all over the world to build paradise on earth. Be prepared at all times, dear children! Practice your bodies, learn your skills, cherish the glorious red scarf, like cherishing your pure heart. Grow up quickly to be heroes, following Mao Zedong and Stalin, and walk on the broad road to a bright future, always listening to their voices.

    给小朋友
    于之毛泽东的阳光照耀着四方，祖国的土地散发着芬芳，你们在这里自由地生长，你们在这里幸福地歌唱。爸爸妈妈流着热汗，为你们建造宽畅的楼房；志愿军叔叔在朝鲜作战，保护你们不受损伤。埋在地下的无数的宝贝，等待着你们去尽量开采；那一望无边的田野，将是你们拖拉机航行的大海。解放全人类的事业，将由你们继续担当，你们将和全世界的兄弟姊妹，把天堂建立在地上。时刻准备着，亲爱的小朋友！练好身体，学好本领，珍爱光荣的红领巾，像珍爱自己纯洁的心。快快长大去做英雄吧，跟随着毛泽东和斯大林，在宽广的道路上走向美好的明天，永远倾听他们的声音。
