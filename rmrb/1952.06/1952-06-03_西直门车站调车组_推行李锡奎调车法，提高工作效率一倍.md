    Xizhimen Station Shunting Team
    Promotes Li Xikui Shunting Method, Increasing Work Efficiency by Onefold
    Comrade Editor: Since Xizhimen Station has promoted the Li Xikui shunting method, our shunting team has been able to master shunting operations, achieving "speed" and "stability." In the past, our station required 30 minutes to assemble each train and 24 minutes to disassemble each train. Now, our team can assemble each train in 15 minutes and disassemble each train in 13 minutes, increasing work efficiency by nearly onefold compared to before. On May 14th, our team assembled two trains and disassembled two trains, taking a total of 45 minutes, averaging only 11 minutes and 15 seconds per train. These achievements are the result of our team members combining the theory and practice learned at Fengtai Station in January. However, there were difficulties at the beginning of promoting this advanced method. Some administrative leaders did not pay enough attention to the promotion work, and some of our team's liaisons also had serious conservative ideas. But these difficulties did not scare us; on the contrary, we found ways to overcome them. Now, the Central Ministry of Railways has called for a movement of full loading, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers. Our team first recognized the significance of this movement and decided to accelerate shunting operations, achieving fast assembly and fast disassembly, without wasting any production time, and thoroughly implementing the Li Xikui shunting method.

    西直门车站调车组
    推行李锡奎调车法，提高工作效率一倍
    编辑同志：西直门车站推行李锡奎调车法以来，我们调车组已能够掌握调车作业，作到了“快”和“稳”。过去，我站编组列车每列需要三十分钟，解体列车每列需要二十四分钟。现在，我组作到编组列车每列用十五分钟，解体列车每列用十三分钟，工作效率比以前提高将近一倍。五月十四日，我组编组两列、解体两列，共用了四十五分钟，平均每列只十一分十五秒。这些成绩，都是我组人员把在一月份到丰台车站学习来的理论和实际相结合的结果。但是，在开始推行这一先进方法的时候，也不是没有困难的。有些行政领导干部曾对推行工作不重视，我组有些联络员也有严重的保守思想。但这些困难并没有吓倒我们，相反地，都被我们想法克服了。现在，中央铁道部已号召展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动。我组首先认识了这个运动的意义，决定加速调车作业，做到快编组、快解体，不浪费一点生产时间，彻底执行李锡奎调车法。                           张连德
