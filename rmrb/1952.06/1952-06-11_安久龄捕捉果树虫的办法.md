    An Ju Ling's Method for Catching Fruit Tree Insects
    Editor: An Ju Ling, a farmer from Qingbaikou Village, Second District, Wanping County, Hebei Province, is recognized by the masses in the entire district as a "Insect Elimination Model." Knowing that insect pests are the mortal enemy of achieving patriotic production increases, he pays special attention to preventing and controlling insect pests. As early as March, he mobilized the masses to scrape tree bark to prevent fruit tree insect pests. In early May, "pear lace bugs" and "stink bugs" appeared on the trees that had not been scraped. Initially, he placed stones next to the tree roots and surrounded them with straw to catch them. After a few days, the number of insects decreased, but they were not completely eliminated. Later, he came up with two methods that were much more effective. One method is to surround the tree roots with loose, dry, fine soil, making the soil pile high enough to allow things to slide down. Because the characteristic of "pear lace bugs" and "stink bugs" is to constantly crawl up and down the tree trunk; if they crawl down and get trapped in the soil, they can no longer climb up. Using this method, he caught more than twenty catties of insects in one morning. Another method is to paste paper on the tree trunk (you can paste several layers as appropriate), but only stick the top end, leaving the bottom end open. In this way, it is easy for the insects to go down the tree, and when they go up the tree, they burrow into the paper cracks, making it easier and more convenient for people to catch them. These two methods of his have been promoted throughout the village, and the insects on the fruit trees throughout the village have been completely caught. The cadres of the Second District also introduced these two methods to the masses in the entire district, and the masses tried them and said they were "very effective." We hope that areas with these insects will also try these two methods.

    安久龄捕捉果树虫的办法
    编辑同志：河北宛平县二区青白口村农民安久龄被全区群众公认为“除虫模范”。他知道虫害是实现爱国丰产的死对头，他特别注意防治虫害。早在三月间，他就带动群众刮树皮，防治果树的虫害。五月初，没刮皮的树上出现了“梨星虫”和“臭臭虫”。最初，他在树根旁边摆上石头，围上谷草，进行捕捉。几天以后，虫是少了，但未捉尽。后来他想了两个办法，效果就大的多了。一个办法是用又松又干的细土，围住树根，土堆要高得能滑下东西。因为“梨星虫”和“臭臭虫”的特点是不断地顺着树杆，上下爬行；要是爬下来陷在土里，它就再也爬不上去了。他用这个办法，一早上便捉了二十多斤虫。另一个办法是在树杆上糊纸（可以酌情多糊几层），但只粘住上端，放开下端。这样，虫子下树容易，上树时就钻到纸缝里，人捉起来省力省事。他这两个办法在全村推广起来，全村果树上的虫子已被捕捉尽净。二区干部又把这两个办法介绍给全区群众，群众试验了，都说“顶事”。我们希望有这种虫子的地区也试用这两个办法。
