Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: TASS Washington, 19th - The public hearing held by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the "General Treaty" concluded between the United States, Britain, France and the Bonn puppet "government" has ended. In the speeches over these past few days, representatives of almost twenty progressive and pacifist groups, as well as other organizations, have demanded that the Senate reject these two war treaties signed with West Germany.

    Dr. Baolong, representative of the American Labor Party, pointed out: "These documents are simply blueprints for atomic warfare. They intensify the shameful plan to revive West German Nazism and militarism... They are intended to ensure that large sums of money continue to be used for armaments, so that large corporations can continue to infringe on the living standards of the American people and reap war profits." Baolong called for a peace conference with the participation of the Soviet Union, and she emphasized: "The best way to defend the true interests of the American people is through peace."

    Economist Van Kleeck, representing the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, demanded the rejection of the war treaties concluded with West Germany and requested immediate negotiations between the four occupying powers to achieve the unification of Germany.

    Reverend Forbes, speaking on behalf of the American Peace Crusaders, also pointed out that millions of Americans "have expressed their deep conviction that negotiation and mutual forbearance can replace war and can indeed be effective."

    Russak, the representative of the New York Labor Peace Conference, firmly condemned the treaty with Adenauer as "paving the way for a revanchist Nazi army."

    The spokesman for the Polish Americans of Michigan unanimously condemned the treaty with the Bonn "government," considering it a violation of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Former Michigan State Senator Novak pointed out that because the United States forced Western European countries to sign this treaty with West Germany, "any of these countries, including West Germany, could face civil war at any time." Novak emphasized that the solution to the German problem lies in unifying Germany through negotiation, rather than through "armament and threats to unify Germany."

    Most, the Executive Secretary of the pacifist religious group "Fellowship of Reconciliation," pointed out the inherent dangers lurking in the continued division of Germany. Most stressed: "This is not peace, but war."

    Green, the representative of the American Veterans for Peace Association, resolutely opposed the military treaty concluded with the Bonn puppet Prime Minister. He said: "If this treaty is ratified, Hitlerism will be able to survive." Green emphasized that the Korean War and the separate military treaty concluded with Adenauer are incompatible with the interests of the American people.

    美国人民反对与波恩缔约
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：美国参议院外交委员会就美、英、法三国与波恩傀儡“政府”间缔结的“一般性条约”一事举行的公众意见听取会已经结束。在这几天来的发言当中，几乎二十个进步的和非战主义团体以及其他团体的代表都要求参议院否决这两个与西德签订的战争条约。
    美国劳工党代表、医师巴奥朗指出：“这些文件简直等于原子战争的蓝图。它们加紧进行了可耻的复活西德纳粹主义及军国主义的计划。……它们用意在于保证继续有大量金钱用在军备上，好让大企业能继续侵害美国人民的生活水准，牟取战争暴利。”巴奥朗号召举行有苏联参加的和平会议，她强调指出：“保卫美国人民真正利益的最好办法就是和平。”
    经济学家范克雷克代表美苏友好全国委员会，要求拒绝与西德缔结的战争条约，并要求四占领国马上举行谈判，以实现德国的统一。
    牧师福贝斯代表美国和平十字军发言时也指出，千千万万美国人“已经表示，他们深信谈判和彼此忍让能够代替战争，而且确能取得成效。”
    纽约劳工和平会议代表鲁萨克坚决地谴责与阿登纳缔结的条约是为复仇主义的“纳粹军队铺平了道路”。
    密执安州美籍波兰人的发言人一致谴责与波恩
    “政府”间的条约，认为那是违犯雅尔塔和波茨坦协定的。前密执安州参议员挪瓦克指出，由于美国强迫西欧各国与西德签订这个条约，“这些国家随便那一个，连西德在内，都随时可能会发生内战”。挪瓦克强调说，德国问题之解决，在于以谈判方法来统一德国，而不是靠“军备和威胁来统一德国”。
    非战主义的宗教团体“修好团契”执行秘书莫斯特指出德国保持分裂状态所潜伏着的内在危险。莫斯特强调说：“这不是和平，而是战争。”
    美国退役军人争取和平协会的代表格林断然反对与波恩傀儡总理缔结的军事条约。他说：“假如这个条约获得批准，希特勒主义就会赖以生存。”格林着重指出，朝鲜战争以及与阿登纳缔结的单独军事条约，是与美国人民利益不相容的。
