    ▲ Liu Cuilian, a roving worker at the No. 9 State-owned Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory, has successfully improved the roving yarn joining method. The roving yarn joint made with this method is neither too loose nor too tight. After the yarn is sent to the spinning machine, the breakage rate at the original joint has been reduced from 60% to 4.5%. At the same time, because the yarn is uniform, the number of thick and tight yarns is reduced, which also greatly reduces the breakage rate of weaving.
    ▲ In order to unify the leadership of the construction work in the old revolutionary base areas of East China, the East China Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committee under the East China Military and Political Committee was established on the 10th. The committee members include Zeng Shan, Wu Kejian, Liu Ruilong, Chen Guodong, and others, totaling twenty people. Zeng Shan serves as the chairman, and Wu Kejian and Liu Ruilong serve as the vice-chairmen. When the committee was established, the East China Military and Political Committee issued instructions on strengthening the work in the old revolutionary base areas of East China.
