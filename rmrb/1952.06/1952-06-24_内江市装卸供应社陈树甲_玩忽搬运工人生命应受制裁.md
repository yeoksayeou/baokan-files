    Chen Shujia of Neijiang City Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative
    Disregarded the Lives of Dockworkers and Should Be Sanctioned
    Editor: Chen Shujia, the administrative team leader of the Neijiang City Loading and Unloading Supply Cooperative in Sichuan South Province, disregarded the lives of workers. On March 19th, a boxcar loaded with 19 tons of asphalt was being unloaded at the station. The Supply Cooperative sent 32 workers to unload the goods. The workers were unaware that asphalt is a toxic substance. After unloading just a few packages, Ma Huayu, the director of the Neijiang Materials Factory, saw that the workers had no protective equipment whatsoever. He urgently told Chen: "Workers must wear masks, goggles, and other protective items. Exposed skin must be coated with a special ointment, and they must rotate every 20 minutes to avoid poisoning." He repeatedly emphasized the importance of this. However, Chen Shujia completely ignored him. Ma Huayu then managed to find seven or eight masks and lent them to the workers. Because the number of masks was insufficient, the workers asked Chen to buy more. He angrily said, "If you are afraid of dying, then don't unload. It is your own business to prepare masks!" At 4:00 PM, everyone discovered that two workers were poisoned and requested to be sent to the hospital for treatment. He replied, "Is it impossible without a hospital? You cannot overcome difficulties. People are bleeding on the front lines; it doesn't matter if one or two people die in the rear." Under his suppression, the workers dared not raise any further objections. The next morning, the remaining 30 workers were also successively poisoned. Chen Shujia still ignored them. The workers had no choice but to go to the Neijiang City Federation of Trade Unions to request a solution. Only then were the workers rescued. The occurrence of this accident was entirely because Chen Shujia had serious bourgeois ideology and treated workers like animals. He should bear full responsibility. Now, we have suggested that the court handle Chen Shujia according to the law.

    内江市装卸供应社陈树甲
    玩忽搬运工人生命应受制裁
    编辑同志：川南内江市装卸供应社行政组长陈树甲玩忽工人生命。三月十九日，某号棚车装载沥青十九吨，在车站卸车。供应社派三十二个工人搬卸货物。工人也不了解沥青是有毒品。刚搬了几包，内江材料厂厂长马华宇看见工人连一点防护设备也没有，就急忙向陈说：“工人要戴口罩、风镜等物，皮肤外露部分必须擦特制油膏，每隔二十分钟轮流换班一次，才不致中毒。”并反覆说明这个问题的重要性。但陈树甲竟毫不理睬。马华宇就设法找了七、八个口罩，借给工人。因为口罩数量不够，工人要求陈去购买。他气愤地说：“你们怕死就不要搬，备口罩是你们自己的事！”下午四时，大家发现有两个工人中毒，要求送医院救治。他回答说：“没有医院就不得了吗？你们不能克服困难。前方流血，后方死个把人没关系。”工人们在他的压制下，不敢再提意见。第二天上午，其余三十个工人也先后中毒。陈树甲还是不理睬。工人们无法，只好到内江市总工会请求处理。这样，工人们才得救了。这次事故的发生，完全是因为陈树甲有严重的资产阶级思想，把工人当牛马看待。他应该负全部责任。现在，我们已建议法院依法处理陈树甲。
