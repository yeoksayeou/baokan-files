Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. The "Democratic Korea" newspaper prominently published on its front page on the 8th a letter from Korean People's Army prisoners of war imprisoned on Geojedo Island. This is a bloody accusation. In their letter, the Korean People's Army prisoners of war complained to their compatriots and comrades about the facts of their cruel massacre, torture, and various persecutions by American executioners, and expressed their firm opposition to the US's conspiracy to forcibly detain them and their unwavering will to return to their motherland. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear comrades and brothers!

    We are writing this letter to you from the dark and damp basements and torture chambers of Geojedo Island.

    We feel that being able to complain to you about our experiences is our greatest happiness.

    This appeal of ours is being conveyed to you through our loyal and steadfast guerrilla comrades. Those comrades who know the terrible experiences we have had in the Geojedo prisoner-of-war camps have sworn to do everything in their power to bring this appeal to the free land of our motherland, to our beloved leader General Kim Il-sung, to all the comrades of the People's Army, and to all the people.

    This appeal is written with our own blood; however, we do not have enough words to fully complain about the suffering and persecution we have endured.

    Since the butcher Bonner, the person in charge of the Geojedo prisoner-of-war camp, came here, our lives have been in even greater danger.

    This bandit Bonner not only violated the promises of the former prisoner-of-war camp负责人(person in charge) Colson, but also intensified the terror, persecution, and abuse against us.

    Death is always waiting for us. Our comrades are sacrificing themselves every day. Fully armed US military guards are running amok in the prisoner-of-war camp, brutally persecuting us. The US military guards drag our comrades out and secretly or publicly kill them with machine guns or carbines. They push hundreds of our comrades into gas chambers or torture chambers.

    Batch after batch of patriots are pushed by these beasts onto trucks with barred windows or police motorcycles with canopies, transported to the seaside to be shot, and their bodies thrown into the sea. Batch after batch of patriots are put on ships and transported to the seaside or remote, uninhabited areas, where they are killed with poison, gas, or bacteriological weapons.

    Here are just a few examples: On May 18, in prisoner-of-war camp No. 76, where Brigadier General Dodd had been imprisoned, thirteen of our comrades were publicly dismembered to death on the orders of the prisoner-of-war camp 负责人(person in charge), the executioner Bonner.

    On the same day, in prisoner-of-war camp No. 77, the US military released tear gas in three locations, immediately killing twenty-four of our comrades and causing forty-six comrades to lose their sight.

    On May 19, in prisoner-of-war camp No. 66, the American bandits concocted an extremely despicable conspiracy. They announced that all prisoners who wished to go to North Korea must be ready to board a ship at 7:00 p.m. that evening and wait in their tents. Of course, without exception, we all hoped to return to our homeland. When we were chanting the affectionate words "Dear motherland, how are you?" and waiting in line to depart, the American soldiers suddenly used machine guns and flamethrowers to strafe us. They even deployed tanks. One hundred and twenty-seven of our comrades were killed on the spot, and many were injured.

    On May 20 and 21, more than 1,000 of our comrades were called to the US military police station and the prisoner-of-war camp 负责人(person in charge)'s house to undergo so-called "voluntary repatriation" "screening." Up to now, 422 people have not returned, and more than 100 people have become unrecognizable cripples, some with broken arms, some with knife wounds in their chests, and some with shameful marks branded on their backs, arms, or chests. The 422 comrades who have not returned are probably either pushed into the sea or shot.

    On May 22 and 23, the US military guards also committed similar bloody atrocities in prisoner-of-war camps No. 602 and No. 73. Those who were massacred were those who refused to build fortifications and supervise labor service for the US military guards. Eighty-eight of our comrades were killed by machine guns and grenades, and thirty-nine were shot or wounded by explosions.

    On May 23, in prisoner-of-war camp No. 76, the American executioners cut off the heads of four patriots and hung them on trees in order to intimidate the "disobedient." On the same day, the American executioners used electric shock in tent No. 16, blinding eighteen of our comrades.

    As we write this letter, May 23 has passed, and May 24 is about to arrive. We clearly know that new persecutions, tortures, abuses, and humiliations are waiting for us.

    Bonner, the American prisoner-of-war camp 负责人(person in charge), has publicly declared that he will severely exact the price for the Dodd and Colson incidents.

    The American executioners are extremely cruel. They are using steel and blood to block our way back to our hometown. They are trying to put us in the uniforms of Syngman Rhee, trying to destroy us in the shameful and sinful war to protect the interests of American and British imperialism. The American butchers are manufacturing extremely despicable torture atrocities for this purpose.

    The American bandits use red-hot irons to make shameful brands on our bodies, beat us with iron bars and whips, even drive police dogs to bite us, steam us in "steam rooms," strangle us, and even dismember our corpses. Man-eating savages wearing American military uniforms barbarously use our patriots as test subjects for bacteriological and chemical weapons. Geojedo Island has become our living hell, and it is our blood and tears, not water, that are washing this island. The bloody smell stimulates our sense of smell everywhere on this island. The American beasts are retaliating against us with unparalleled brutality. They want to retaliate against us because we demand that they abide by the Geneva Convention and protest against inhuman treatment; because we hope to return to the free land of our motherland and refuse to serve the Syngman Rhee bandit gang; because we are unwilling to be slaves of the United States.

    However, no atrocity can subdue us, and no atrocity can suppress our firm will to return to our hometown so that we can reunite with our comrades who are fighting for the honor and freedom of our motherland.

    We unanimously believe that, like mother and son, we are inseparable from our motherland and from peace-loving people. Although we are imprisoned in dark cellars, surrounded by barbed wire and bunkers; however, we feel that we are always with our motherland, with our people, and with our leader General Kim Il-sung.

    Although the enemy threatens us with gallows, torture chambers, bacteria, gunpowder, and other killing weapons, our thoughts and will are always with our motherland, our people, and our leader General Kim Il-sung.

    Although we have become prisoners of the American bandits and are imprisoned in a disaster-stricken hell, we will never be discouraged, never surrender, and never kneel before the executioners. We will never give up our hopeful belief that our people, the People's Army, and our leader General Kim Il-sung will never leave us in disaster and will never let us die in the clutches of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandits.

    Now, as we face the danger of being slaughtered by the American beasts and are in extreme pain, we call on our comrades, brothers and sisters, to support us, shorten our suffering time, and rescue our lives from the clutches of American imperialism. Our cause is just. We will fight for the human right to return to our motherland. We will advance courageously in this sacred and great struggle. The stronger and more organized our struggle to return to the free land of our motherland is, the more frantic the American fascist bandits will become.

    We unanimously declare as follows:

    We will never fear, never surrender, never be cannon fodder for the enemy, and never be slaves of the United States. With the help of the people, with the help of our close comrades, the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, and with the help of all progressive mankind, we will resolutely defend our rights, our personality, and our honor.

    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our motherland!

    Long live the heroic Korean people!

    Long live the Workers' Party and our beloved leader General Kim Il-sung!

    The letter was signed by 6,223 Korean People's Army prisoners of war on Geojedo Island. The letter was sent on May 23.

    巨济岛朝鲜人民军被俘人员寄出呼吁书
    控诉美国刽子手残杀战俘暴行
    坚决要求返回祖国反对美方强迫扣留
    【新华社平壤九日电】此间“民主朝鲜”报八日以一版显著地位刊载了被囚禁在巨济岛上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员的一封来信。这是一篇血的控诉。朝鲜人民军被俘人员在信中向同胞和战友申诉他们受到美国刽子手的残酷屠杀、非刑拷打和种种迫害的事实，并表示了他们坚决反对美方强迫扣留的阴谋和要求回返祖国的不屈意志。来信全文如下：亲爱的战友兄弟们！
    我们在巨济岛黑暗潮湿的地下室和拷问室里给你们写了这封信。
    我们觉得能够向你们申诉我们的遭遇是我们最大的幸福。
    我们这个呼吁是通过我们忠诚坚贞的游击队同志们转达给你们的。那些了解我们在巨济岛俘虏营的恐怖遭遇的战友们，宣誓要尽一切努力，把这个呼吁带给我们祖国的自由土地、我们敬爱的领袖金日成将军、人民军全体同志和全体人民。
    我们这个呼吁是我们用自己的心血写成的；但是，我们来不及想出足以充分申诉我们所遭受的痛苦和迫害的词句。
    巨济岛俘虏营负责人、屠夫波纳来到这里以后，使我们的生命更加迫近了危险。
    波纳这个匪徒不但违背了前俘虏营负责人柯尔生的诺言，而且加剧了对我们的恐怖迫害和虐待。
    死在随时等待着我们。我们的同志每天每天都在牺牲着。全副武装的美军警备兵们在俘虏营里横冲直撞，残暴地迫害我们。美军警备兵们把我们的同志拉出去用机枪或卡宾枪秘密地或公开地加以杀害。他们把我们数百名同志推进毒气室或拷问室里去。
    一批一批的爱国者被野兽们推到装有铁窗的卡车上或有篷盖的警察摩托车上运往海边枪毙后，把尸体扔到海里。一批一批的爱国者被装在船里，运到海边或遥远的无人地带，用毒药、毒气或细菌武器杀害。
    这里只举几个实例：五月十八日，在曾经囚禁过杜德准将的第七十六号俘虏营里，按照俘虏营负责人、刽子手波纳的命令，我们的十三个同志被当众分尸而死。
    同一天，在第七十七号俘虏营里，美军在三个场所向俘虏施放了催泪毒气，当即有我们的二十四个同志死去，四十六个同志丧失了视力。
    五月十九日，在第六十六号俘虏营，美国强盗制造了卑鄙到极点的阴谋。他们当时宣布凡是希望到北朝鲜去的俘虏必须在当晚七点钟作好乘船准备，在自己的帐篷里待命。当然，没有一个人例外，我们全都希望回到故乡。当我们叨念着“亲爱的祖国，你好吗？”这句亲切的话语列队等候出发时，美国兵竟用机关枪、火焰喷射器向我们扫射起来。他们甚至出动了坦克。我们的同志当场死了一百二十七人，并有许多人负伤。
    在五月二十日和二十一日两天中，我们的同志有一千人以上被叫到美军警备所和俘虏营负责人的房子里，受到了所谓“自愿遣返”的“甄别”，直到现在，还有四百二十二人没有回来，另外还有一百人以上已经变成了血肉不分的残废，有的断臂，有的胸部受了刀伤，有的背上、胳臂或胸前被烙上了耻辱的印记。那没有回来的四百二十二位同志，恐怕不是被推到海里，就是被枪杀了。
    二十二日和二十三日，美军警备兵们在第六百零二号和第七十三号俘虏营里也制造了类似的血腥暴行。被屠杀的人们都是拒绝去做替美军警备兵建筑火力点和监视劳役的人。我们的同志被机关枪和手榴弹杀死了八十八人，射伤或炸伤三十九人。
    五月二十三日，在第七十六号俘虏营，美国刽子手为了恫吓“不逊”的人，曾把四位爱国者的头颅砍下来挂在树上。同一天，美国刽子手又在第十六号帐篷里用电刑使我们的十八个同志变成了瞎子。
    我们写这封信的时候，五月二十三日已经过去，五月二十四日就要到来。我们清楚地知道新的迫害、拷问、虐待、凌辱正在等待着我们。
    美国俘虏营负责人波纳已经公开扬言，一定要狠狠地索取杜德和柯尔生事件的代价。
    美国刽子手是残暴无比的。他们正用钢铁和鲜血阻挡着我们返回故乡的道路。他们正在企图给我们穿上李承晚的军服，企图使我们毁灭在保护美、英帝国主义利益的可耻的罪恶战争中。美国屠夫们正在这种目的下制造卑鄙到极点的拷问暴行。
    美国强盗们用烧红了的铁在我们身上制造耻辱的烙印，用铁条和皮鞭抽打我们，甚至驱使警狗咬我们，在“蒸气室”里蒸我们，绞杀我们，还要分我们的尸。穿着美国军服的吃人生番们野蛮地把我们爱国者当做细菌武器、化学武器的试验品。巨济岛成了我们的活地狱，是我们的血和泪而不是水在冲洗着这个岛屿。在这个岛上，到处是血腥的气息刺激着我们的嗅觉。美国野兽残暴无比地向我们报复。他们要向我们报复，是因为我们要求他们遵守日内瓦公约，抗议非人待遇；是因为我们希望回到我们祖国自由的大地，拒绝为李承晚匪帮服务；是因为我们不愿意做美国的奴隶。
    但是，任何暴行也不能使我们屈服，任何暴行也不能抑止我们坚决要求回到家乡，以便和为祖国的荣誉和自由而斗争着的战友们重聚的意志。
    我们一致认为：就像母亲和儿子一样，我们和祖国、和爱好和平的人民，是不可分离的。尽管我们被监禁在黑暗的地窖里，被铁丝网和火力点包围着；然而，我们觉得我们时时刻刻都是和我们的祖国、和我们的人民、和我们的领袖金日成将军在一起的。
    尽管敌人用绞刑台、拷问室、细菌、火药等杀人武器威胁我们，我们的思想和意志却时时刻刻都是和我们的祖国、我们的人民以及我们的领袖金日成将军在一起的。
    尽管我们成了美国强盗的俘虏，被囚禁在灾难深重的地狱里，我们决不气馁，决不屈服，决不会在刽子手面前屈膝。我们也决不会放弃我们充满希望的信念——我们的人民、人民军、我们的领袖金日成将军，决不会听任我们处在灾难中而不理，决不会听任我们死在美国侵略者和李承晚卖国匪帮的魔窟里。
    现在，当我们面临被美国野兽屠杀净尽的危险而极端痛苦的时候，我们呼吁我们的战友兄弟姊妹们支持我们，缩短我们的痛苦时间，从美帝国主义的魔掌中救出我们的生命。我们的事业是正义的。我们将为归还祖国的人类权利而斗争。我们将在这神圣的伟大斗争中，奋命前进。我们争取返回我们祖国自由土地的斗争愈是坚强和有组织，美国法西斯匪徒就愈加疯狂。
    我们全体一致声明如下：
    我们决不畏惧，决不屈服，决不充当敌人的炮灰，也决不做美国的奴隶。我们将在人民的帮助之下，在我们的亲密战友、光荣的中国人民志愿军的帮助之下，在全体进步人类的帮助之下，坚决保卫自己的权利、自己的人格和自己的荣誉。
    我们的祖国朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
    在信上签名的有巨济岛上的朝鲜人民军被俘人员六千二百二十三人。该信发送日期是五月二十三日。
