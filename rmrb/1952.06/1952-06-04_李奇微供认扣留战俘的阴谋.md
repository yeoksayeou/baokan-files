Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd—Former Commander-in-Chief of the US invading army in Korea, Ridgway, has admitted the US side’s sinister conspiracy to deliberately detain a large number of our captured personnel. According to a report in the May 26th "New York Herald Tribune," Ridgway testified before the US Senate Armed Services Committee that the US side "had considered sending 50,000 or 60,000 stubborn communist prisoners of war to the Mariana Islands or Saipan, or even to the United States." Observers here pointed out that Ridgway’s statement shows that the US side had long premeditated to detain a large number of our captured personnel, and further confirms the fact admitted in the reply letter from Colson, the former US commander of the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, that the US side had forcibly screened our captured personnel and re-armed them in order to use them as cannon fodder for the US to expand its war of aggression.

    李奇微供认扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城三日电】前美国侵朝军总司令李奇微承认了美方蓄意扣留我方大批被俘人员的罪恶阴谋。据五月二十六日“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，李奇微在美国参议院军事委员会作证时说，美方“曾考虑把五万或六万顽强的共产党战俘，送到马利安纳群岛或塞班岛，或者甚至送到美国去”。此间观察家指出：李奇微的发言说明美方早就蓄意扣留大批我方被俘人员，并进一步证实了前巨济岛美方战俘营负责人柯尔生复信中所承认的事实，即美方曾经对我方被俘人员进行强迫甄别并予以重新武装，以便使他们充当美国扩大侵略战争的炮灰。
