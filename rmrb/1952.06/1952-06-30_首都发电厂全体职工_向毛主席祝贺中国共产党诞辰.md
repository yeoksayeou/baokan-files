    All Staff of the Capital Power Plant
    Congratulate Chairman Mao on the Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
    [Our Newspaper] On the eve of "July 1st," all the staff of the Capital Power Plant wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, congratulating him on the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The full text of the original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    In order to welcome the Party's birthday, all our factory's staff have formulated a production increase and frugality plan for the second half of the year. We assure you that we have full confidence in overfulfilling the task. On the eve of "July 1st," we especially congratulate you, congratulating you and the Communist Party of China on leading the Chinese people from victory to victory, and on going to even greater victories.
    The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have changed society, and our factory has also shown a new atmosphere. On the basis of this victory, on the eve of "May 1st," we signed a collective contract and launched an unprecedented production increase and frugality competition. Under the leadership of the Party, we have established a trend of learning advanced experience, and workers and technicians are more closely united. In the past two months, we have launched a movement to tap potential and find tricks. The biggest trick is to overcome the many difficulties in ideology, management, and technology. The trial burning of inferior coal was successful. In the past, we burned good coal from mines such as Kailuan, Kouquan, and Chengzi. Now we are burning coal washing stone, coke powder, and coal slime from steel plants, and the burning cost has been reduced by 41 percent. We plan to save the country more than 100,000 tons of good coal and more than 3,300 transport carriages. According to the opinions of Soviet experts, we have solved problems such as low steam temperature and boiler clinkering; the output of coal grinders has also broken through the old quota; and the Liu Dezhen group is taking the lead in learning the Soviet advanced rapid maintenance method.
    This year, in the total amount of 4 trillion yuan for the production increase and frugality of industrial and mining enterprises in North China, we accepted the task of 8.44 billion yuan, but after further research and the launch of the movement to find tricks and tap potential, all employees proposed to ensure the completion of the 10 billion yuan production increase and frugality target, and strive to complete the creation of 15 billion yuan of wealth through production increase and frugality!
    Thanks to your concern, our 160 new dormitories will soon be completed. Next season, we also plan to build a night shift rest room, a bathhouse, and expand our children's primary school.
    Chairman Mao: Every one of us always remembers your instructions. We are working hard every day, studying, working, and improving our political, cultural, and technical levels, actively increasing production and practicing frugality, and strengthening the national defense and economic construction of our great motherland. We are also always vigilant against imperialist aggression and strive to defend world peace. On the eve of the 31st anniversary of the birth of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, all our staff wish you good health!

    首都发电厂全体职工
    向毛主席祝贺中国共产党诞辰
    【本报讯】首都发电厂全体职工在“七一”前夕，写信给毛主席，祝贺中国共产党成立三十一周年。原信全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    为了迎接党的生日，我厂的全体职工已订出了下半年的增产节约计划，我们向您保证，我们有充分信心超额完成任务。在“七一”前夕，我们特向您祝贺，祝贺您和中国共产党领导着中国人民从胜利走向胜利，并且将要走向更伟大的胜利。
    伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，使社会变了样，我厂也呈现了一片新气象。在这胜利的基础上，“五一”前夕，我们订了集体合同，展开了规模空前的增产节约大竞赛。在党的领导下，我们树立了学习先进经验的风气，工人和技术人员团结得更紧密了。这两个月来，我们展开了挖潜力、找窍门的运动。最大的窍门，就是克服了思想上、管理上、技术上的重重困难。试烧劣质煤成功了，过去我们烧的是开滦、口泉、城子等矿的好煤，现在我们烧的是钢铁厂的洗煤石、焦末和煤泥，燃烧成本降低了百分之四十一。我们计划要给国家省下十万吨以上的好煤和三千三百多辆运输车皮。根据苏联专家的意见，我们解决了蒸气温度低、锅炉生熘子等问题；磨煤机产量也突破了旧的定额；刘德珍小组正在带头学习苏联先进的快速检修法。
    今年全华北区工矿企业增产节约四万亿元的总额中，我们接受了八十四亿四千万元的任务，但是经过我们进一步地研究和展开找窍门、挖潜力的运动，全体职工提出了要保证完成增产节约一百亿元，并为争取完成增产节约一百五十亿元的财富而奋斗！
    由于您的关怀，我们一百六十多间新宿舍即将竣工了。下季我们还计划要盖一所夜班休息室、一所澡堂，并扩大我们的子弟小学。
    毛主席：我们每一个人都随时记着您对我们的嘱咐，我们每天都在努力学习着、工作着、提高政治、文化、技术水平，积极增产节约，加强我们伟大的祖国的国防和经济建设。我们并时刻警惕着帝国主义的侵略和为保卫世界和平而奋斗。当伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党诞生三十一周年纪念日的前夕，我们全体职工祝您身体健康！
                石景山首都发电厂全体职工上
               六月二十七日
