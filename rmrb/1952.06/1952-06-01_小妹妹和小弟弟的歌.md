The Song of Little Sisters and Little Brothers

	In Paris, little sisters and little brothers play marbles in the streets. In Sousse, Tunisia, police beat little sisters and little brothers. They imprisoned the little sister's father, causing her to cry. In Madrid, little sisters and little brothers beg barefoot in the streets. In Milan, the little sister's and little brother's father is unemployed. In New York, the little sister's and little brother's father was brutally murdered. In the ruins of Pyongyang, destroyed by American bandits, the little brother finally found his little sister. Blood had congealed into a flower on her forehead, and she was still clutching her beloved doll. Madagascar is a French colony, where reactionaries killed little sisters and little brothers. Vietnamese children watched as their villages were burned to the ground by imperialist napalm bombs. On the white streets of Athens, little sisters and little brothers are heartbroken; reactionaries have shot Greek patriots, including the little sister's and little brother's older brother – Beloyannis. But in today's New China, we see smiling children everywhere. From Beijing to Hangzhou, children are dancing joyful Yangko dances; on May Day, doves of peace are released from their hands! Doves of peace fly to Paris, fly to Milan, fly to Madrid. Doves fly everywhere, bringing the joy of peace to little sisters and little brothers all over the world! Doves fly everywhere! Bringing a happy life to little sisters and little brothers all over the world!

    小妹妹和小弟弟的歌
    格莱·罗阿巴黎的小妹妹和小弟弟在街上玩着弹球戏。在突尼斯的苏士城里，警察动手打了小妹妹和小弟弟。他们把小妹妹的爸爸关在监狱里，急得小妹妹哭泣。马德里的小妹妹和小弟弟，光着脚在街上要饭。米兰的小妹妹和小弟弟，他们的爸爸失了业。在纽约，小妹妹和小弟弟的爸爸，遭人横暴地谋杀。在美国强盗炸毁的平壤的废墟里，小弟弟好容易找到了小妹妹，鲜血在小妹妹额上凝结成了花，她怀里还搂着心爱的洋娃娃。马达加斯加岛是法国的殖民地，那儿的反动派杀死了小妹妹和小弟弟，越南的孩子们眼看他们的村庄被帝国主义用凝固汽油弹烧光。在雅典的洁白的街道上，小妹妹和小弟弟心里悲伤；反动派枪杀了希腊的志士，小妹妹和小弟弟的大哥—贝劳扬尼斯，可是在今天的新中国，我们看见小朋友们笑容满面，从北京一直到杭州，小朋友们在扭着快乐的秧歌；在“五一”节，和平的鸽子从他们手里纷纷飞起！和平鸽子飞往巴黎，飞往米兰，飞往马德里。鸽子满天飞，把和平的欢喜带给全世界的小妹妹和小弟弟！鸽子满天飞！把幸福的生活带给全世界的小姊妹小兄弟！
