Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Seven hundred and two overseas Chinese, unjustly expelled by the British colonial authorities in Malaya, arrived in Guangzhou by ship on the 17th. This is the sixteenth group since 1950. More than 60 percent of these compatriots are women and children under the age of twelve. They were unreasonably arrested and thrown into concentration camps by the British colonial government in Malaya, and subjected to torture and abuse. Miner Ye Xing had his left leg broken by British military police gunfire and was detained in a concentration camp for nearly four years. His left leg is now disabled. Vegetable grower Liu Zhenrong was subjected to brutal beatings and electric shocks after being arrested. This strong man in his thirties was so devastated that his face was sallow and his hair was gray, resembling an old man in his fifties or sixties. After returning to Guangzhou, the returned overseas Chinese received warm greetings and proper resettlement from local overseas Chinese affairs agencies. People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City are extremely angry at the continuous and barbaric persecution suffered by overseas Chinese residing in Malaya.

    被英国殖民当局无理驱逐出境的
    马来亚华侨七百余人返广州
    【新华社广州十八日电】被马来亚英国殖民当局无理驱逐出境的华侨七百零二人，在十七日乘船抵达广州。这是自一九五零年以来的第十六批。这批侨胞中有百分之六十以上是妇女和十二岁以下的幼童。他们曾先后被马来亚英国殖民政府无理逮捕，投入集中营，并受到拷刑虐待。矿工叶兴被英国军警用枪打断左腿骨，并被拘禁在集中营内近四年之久，现在他的左腿已成残废。种菜工人刘振荣被捕后，遭受残酷的殴打和电刑，这位三十来岁的壮年人被摧残得脸容黄瘦，头发斑白，仿佛五、六十岁的老人。难侨们返抵广州后，得到当地侨务机关的热情慰问和妥善安置。广东省、广州市各界人民对于居留马来亚的侨胞不断遭受横蛮的迫害，都极感愤怒。
