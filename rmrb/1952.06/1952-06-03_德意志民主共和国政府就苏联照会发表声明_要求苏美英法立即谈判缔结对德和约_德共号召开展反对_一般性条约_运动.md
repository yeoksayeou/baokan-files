(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 2nd) According to TASS, Berlin: The Government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on May 30th regarding the Soviet note to Western countries on May 24th. It declared, "The Government of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the restoration of German unity through free, all-German elections conducted by secret ballot, as this is the only path to guarantee Germany's future. The German people also fully support this view of the government."

The statement then pointed out: Despite this, the German nation still faces the danger of further division and the outbreak of fratricidal war due to the "General Treaty" signed by the aggressive forces of West Germany and the aggressive forces of the United States, Britain, and France. Adenauer's signing of the harsh, militaristic "General Treaty" has caused great excitement among all German people. The Government of the German Democratic Republic also expresses its indignation at the Adenauer government's actions. All German people firmly demand unification and a peace treaty stipulating the subsequent withdrawal of all occupying forces from Germany. They hope for friendly and peaceful cooperation with all other nations and are unwilling to participate in the bloody adventures that American imperialism is preparing in Europe. Those who support the militaristic "General Treaty" cannot call themselves Germans. Those who support a separate treaty are just a handful of traitors who have come to power with the help of American occupiers.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic specifically pointed out the support given by the Soviet Union to the legitimate national demands of the German people. The Soviet Union's May 24th note once again suggested that the four major powers immediately conduct negotiations to expedite the conclusion of a German peace treaty and restore German unity. This suggestion paves the way for realizing the wishes of the German people and eliminating the dangers they face. The Government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes this new, selfless move by the Soviet government and expresses its gratitude to the Soviet government and the great Stalin on behalf of all German people. The German people demand that the great powers begin negotiations immediately.

The statement concluded: "At this critical juncture, the Government of the German Democratic Republic calls on all German patriots in the eastern and western parts of our homeland to use all their strength to save our nation. The ratification of this militaristic 'General Treaty' by the Bonn parliament and the implementation of this treaty must be stopped by the most resolute national resistance! At the same time, the Government of the German Democratic Republic calls on the people of the German Democratic Republic to unite more closely around the government under the banner of the National Front of Democratic Germany and to support the measures taken by the government to strengthen the German Democratic Republic, because the German Democratic Republic has been, is, and will be the foundation of the German people's struggle for peace and unity."

(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 31st) According to the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a circular calling on all party members to fully support the people's movement to strive for a German peace treaty and oppose the "General Treaty." The circular said:

"The Presidium of the Conference for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Concluding a Just Peace Treaty among the German People, on May 17, 1952, issued a letter to all German patriots and patriotic organizations, calling on them to declare, through a movement expressing the will of the people: 'We support a German peace treaty and oppose the "General Treaty."' This call has received a widespread response from the very beginning. Millions have already responded to this call in mass rallies, demonstrations, and protest strikes. This proves that the patriotic forces in West Germany have begun to unite into a powerful movement. Uniting all patriotic forces is the current slogan, because once patriotic forces are united, they will become a force that can stop Adenauer and his American masters from forcing the German people to accept the 'General Treaty' that revives militarism, and can overthrow the Adenauer government. The movement expressing the will of the people, combined with other forms of resistance, as well as the protest actions of peasants, immigrants, artisans, youth, intellectuals, and bourgeois strata, will unequivocally prove that Adenauer's actions are contrary to the will of the German people and that his signature on the 'General Treaty' is invalid. This will show the people of all countries that the German people will not allow others to drag them into war. The German people can believe that the peace-loving people of all countries will give the German people all their support and help them realize their just demands for the conclusion of a peace treaty as proposed by the Soviet Union. The German Communist Party welcomes the call of the Presidium of the Conference for Promoting Mutual Understanding and Concluding a Just Peace Treaty among the German People. The German Communist Party is fully willing to fully support the movement for the expression of the people's will. The German Communist Party is willing to cooperate with all those who express support for the peace treaty and opposition to the 'General Treaty.' The Central Committee of the German Communist Party calls on all party members and party workers to reach unified action with workers participating in the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and non-party workers in the struggle for a peace treaty and against the 'General Treaty,' because the unified action of workers is the solid core of a large-scale patriotic people's movement. The Central Committee of the Communist Party directs all party members and party workers to promote the unity of all national forces with all their strength. The situation is very serious. The fate of the nation is decided today, and there is no time to delay. Now the people should make a decision. Concentrate all efforts so that the people can express support for a German peace treaty and opposition to the 'General Treaty.'"

    德意志民主共和国政府就苏联照会发表声明
    要求苏美英法立即谈判缔结对德和约
    德共号召开展反对“一般性条约”运动
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国政府于五月三十日就苏联于五月二十四日致西方国家的照会发表声明。宣告“德意志民主共和国政府完全赞成缔结对德和约和以秘密投票方式举行全德自由选举来恢复德国的统一，因为这是保障德国前途的唯一道路。德国人民也完全拥护政府的这一意见。”
    声明接着指出：虽然如此，由于西德侵略力量与美、英、法三国侵略力量签订了“一般性条约”，德意志民族仍然面临着进一步分裂和爆发自相残杀战争的危险。阿登纳签订了苛刻的、军国主义性质的“一般性条约”，这引起了全体德国人民的很大激动。德意志民主共和国政府也对阿登纳政府的这种举动表示愤慨。全体德国人民坚决要求统一和规定一切占领军随后撤出德国的和约。他们希望和一切其他民族友好并和平合作，而不愿意参加美帝国主义正在欧洲准备的血腥冒险。凡是支持军国主义性质的“一般性条约”的人就不能自称为德国人。支持单独条约的人只是一小撮在美国占领者帮助下获得政权的卖国贼。
    德意志民主共和国政府特别指出苏联对德国人民的正当的民族要求所给予的支持。苏联五月二十四日照会中再次建议四大国立即进行谈判，以从速缔结对德和约并恢复德国的统一。这一建议为实现德国人民的愿望和消除他们面临的危险，铺平了道路。德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联政府这一新的大公无私的举动，并代表全体德国人民对苏联政府和伟大的斯大林表示感激。德国人民要求大国立即开始谈判。
    声明最后说：“当此紧要关头，德意志民主共和国政府号召我们祖国东部和西部的全体德国爱国者用一切力量来挽救我们的民族。必须用最坚决的全国性反抗，来制止波恩议会批准这一军国主义性质的‘一般性条约’，制止这一条约的实施！同时，德意志民主共和国政府号召德意志民主共和国的人民在民主德国全国阵线的旗帜下更紧密地团结在政府的周围，拥护政府为加强德意志民主共和国所采取的措施，因为德意志民主共和国过去、现在和将来都是德国人民争取和平和统一斗争的基础。”
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社柏林五月三十一日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央委员会发表通告，号召全体党员全力支持争取对德和约、反对“一般性条约”的人民运动。通告说：
    “一九五二年五月十七日促进德国人民互相谅解与缔结公正和约大会主席团发表告全体德国爱国人士和各爱国团体书，号召他们以表达人民意志的运动来声明：‘我们拥护对德和约、反对“一般性条约”。’这个号召一开始就得到广泛的响应。成百万人已经在群众大会上、在示威游行中、在抗议罢工期间，回答了这个号召。这证明西德的爱国力量已开始团结在一起成为一个强大运动了。团结一切爱国力量，这是当前的口号，因为爱国力量一经团结起来，就会成为一种力量，可以制止阿登纳及其美国主子强使德国人民接受复活军国主义的‘一般性条约’，可以推翻阿登纳政府。表达人民意志的运动跟其他各种形式的反抗，以及农民、移民、手工业者、青年、知识分子与资产阶级阶层的抗议行动结合在一起，就将毫不含糊地证明：阿登纳的行动是违反德国人民意志的，他对‘一般性条约’的签字是没有效力的。这将向各国人民表明：德国人民是不容许别人把他们拖进战争的。德国人民可以相信，各国爱好和平的人民将给德国人民以一切支持，帮助他们实现其主张缔结如苏联所建议的和约的那种正义要求。德国共产党欢迎促进德国人民互相谅解与缔结公正和约大会主席团的号召。德国共产党完全愿意充分支持人民表达意志的运动。德国共产党愿与一切表示拥护和约、反对‘一般性条约’的人们合作。德国共产党中央委员会号召全体党员与党的工作人员在争取和约、反对‘一般性条约’的斗争中与参加社会民主党、基督教民主党的工人以及无党无派的工人达成统一行动，因为工人的统一行动是大规模的爱国人民运动的坚固核心。共产党中央委员会责成全体党员与党的工作人员以全力促进一切民族力量的团结。局势是非常严重的。国家命运决定于今天，再不容迟延了。现在人民应该拿出决定来。集中全力使人民可以表示拥护对德和约，反对‘一般性条约’。”
