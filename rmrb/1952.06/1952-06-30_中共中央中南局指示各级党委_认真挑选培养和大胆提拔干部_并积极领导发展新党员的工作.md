Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th:

The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau recently issued instructions requiring party committees at all levels and responsible party member cadres in all departments to carefully select, actively cultivate, and boldly promote cadres.

The instructions pointed out: In the past three years, the focus of the Party's leadership and the use of cadre strength in the entire Central-South region has been mainly in rural areas. This year, the task of rural reform will basically come to an end, and large-scale economic construction, mainly industrial construction, is about to begin. To adapt to the needs of national construction tasks, the Party's leadership focus must immediately shift to cities and industrial construction; a large number of Party leading cadres with political awareness, upright work style, and strong working ability must be selected to meet the needs of cities and industry. The Three-Anti Movement identified and tested our cadre ranks. Therefore, on the basis of the Three-Anti Movement, combined with the various tasks of the past three years, a group of advanced elements and activists who have grown up in the movement must be selected, cultivated, and promoted to appropriate positions to become the basic backbone of various tasks.

The scope of selection and promotion should not be limited to old cadres, Party and League members, and young intellectuals, but should select and promote cadres in an organized and conscientious manner from all advanced elements and activists in various movements and various tasks, from workers and shop assistants after the Five-Anti Movement, and from farmers after the land reform review.

Party organizations at all levels and responsible party member cadres in all departments must regard understanding, selecting, cultivating, and promoting cadres as their regular and important tasks. It is a manifestation of incompetence for the serious task of "discovering talent" if one cannot regularly discover, cultivate, and promote enough cadres from one's subordinates and only reaches out to superiors for people. One must understand the cadres under one's jurisdiction "as if counting family treasures," regularly keep a list of cadres selected for cultivation and promotion, and properly formulate plans for education, cultivation, and promotion.

Candidates for promotion to cadre positions should generally be promoted level by level, except for a few special cases that require and allow for promotion across levels. The process of selection or promotion is also a process of helping and testing.

The opinions of the masses must be listened to during selection, and education must be provided regularly after selection. It must be subjected to organized review according to certain procedures, and a closed-door attitude or blind and hasty actions must not be adopted. Leaders at all levels must regularly and concretely help new cadres who have been selected and promoted, promote their study of professional work, urge them to continuously improve politically, educate them to maintain close ties with the masses, and systematically improve their various levels to guide them to continue to advance and enable them to quickly establish faith among the masses and successfully complete various tasks. Irresponsible attitudes of not helping and educating new cadres, bureaucratic attitudes of simply scolding or kicking them away for their mistakes, or considering their promotion not for the development of the cause but for one's own ease are all wrong and must be corrected.

The instructions pointed out: To implement the task of carefully selecting, actively cultivating, and boldly promoting cadres, we must oppose conservative views, closed-doorism, sectarianism, one-sidedness, and blindness in these tasks. Conservative views fail to see the development of the revolution, disregard the overall situation, and keep cadres who can and should be promoted around themselves for a long time, not allowing them to be transferred. Another is adhering to the "qualifications theory," only looking at cadres' past and not their present, ignoring cadres' progress, and ignoring the contributions of new cadres to the revolution. This must be opposed first. Closed-doorism is refusing to allow new cadres to better serve the people and making excessively unrealistic demands on new cadres without promoting them. These erroneous ideas hinder the growth of new forces. Sectarianism focuses the selection and promotion of cadres only on a few people and within one's own small circle based on erroneous cadre standards, which inevitably buries talents among the broad masses and cadres. This is very harmful to the revolutionary cause. One-sidedness is selecting cadres only from personal preferences, without understanding the masses, without comprehensive investigation, and promoting them only based on temporary and superficial performances, which often does not meet our basic requirements for cadres. Blindness is manifested in the lack of planning and a lack of clear cadre policy thinking, so that cadres are often not promoted for the sake of work. This not only fails to achieve the purpose of strengthening work but also fails to achieve the purpose of improving cadres.

The instructions finally emphasized: Without a sufficient number and higher quality of cadres, we cannot guarantee the completion of our great construction tasks, and without industrial construction, there is no future for socialism, and our revolution cannot advance. Therefore, party committees at all levels should formulate concrete plans, boldly, correctly, and in an organized manner select and promote cadres at the present time after the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements when conditions are available and greatly needed.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 28th: The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau recently issued instructions on actively developing new Party members, requiring local party committees to strengthen leadership and immediately start this work with the most active spirit.

The instructions said: Over the past three years, the political consciousness of the broad masses in the entire Central-South region has been increasing day by day through a series of mass movements such as the Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, land reform, and democratic reform in urban factories and mines, especially the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements in the past six months. A large number of outstanding activists have been tempered from the movements, and many of them have been tested by multiple movements, consistently demonstrating active struggle and a firm stance, becoming the backbone of various movements, and many of them are asking to join the Party. Therefore, absorbing Party members from these people and establishing Party organizations is not only a condition, but also has become an urgent political task at the moment.

Sufficient preparations should be made before developing new Party members. Experienced and capable Party member cadres should be selected from the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and land reform work teams and assigned the task of organizers. They should draw up a list of activists and make a plan for developing Party members, submit it to the higher-level Party committee for approval, and then conduct the necessary investigation, cultivation, and education work according to the plan. However, in places where new Party members are being prepared for development, publicity and education work about the Party should be carried out on a large scale in an organized and planned manner to more widely improve the political consciousness and understanding of the Party among the masses.

In order to implement the policy of actively and cautiously developing new Party members, we must overcome erroneous ideas on this issue. At present, we must focus on opposing neglecting the importance of Party building work. All Party member cadres, especially those who are actually responsible for Party building work, must be educated to deeply understand the serious political significance of Party building work and the reasons for adhering to the eight conditions of Party member standards, and treat Party building work with a serious attitude.

The instructions finally pointed out: The basic key to ensuring the smooth completion of the Party development plan lies in the leadership of the Party committee, the mobilization of the entire Party, and the specific management of the organization department. Party committees at all levels must put Party development work on the important agenda, seriously discuss, arrange, and periodically inspect and supervise it; all Party members must undertake certain Party building work in their respective positions; Party grassroots organizations must regularly assign and check the work of each Party member; and organization departments at all levels should use their greatest strength to specifically guide Party development work, timely summarize experience, solve problems that occur in the work, and overcome deviations that occur. Only in this way can we complete this serious and huge political task.

    中共中央中南局指示各级党委
    认真挑选培养和大胆提拔干部
    并积极领导发展新党员的工作
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】中共中央中南局日前发出指示，要求所属各级党委和一切部门的党员负责干部要认真挑选、积极培养和大胆提拔干部。
    指示指出：过去三年内，中南全区党的领导重心和干部力量的使用主要放在农村。今年农村的改革任务基本上将告一段落，而大规模的以工业建设为主的经济建设工作即将开始。为适应国家建设任务的需要，党的领导重心必须立即转到城市和工业建设上来；必须挑选一大批政治开展、作风正派与工作能力较强的党的领导干部，来满足城市和工业的需要。三反运动鉴别和考验了我们的干部队伍。因此，必须在三反运动的基础上，结合三年来的各种工作，挑选一批从运动中生长起来的先进分子和积极分子，在加以培养之后，提拔到适当的岗位上来，成为各种工作的基本骨干。
    挑选对象和提拔对象的范围，不限于老干部、党团员和青年知识分子，而应该从各种运动和各种工作中的所有先进分子和积极分子中，从五反后的工人、店员中，从土地改革复查后的农民中去有组织地认真挑选干部和提拔干部。
    各级党的组织，一切部门的党员负责干部，必须把了解、挑选、培养和提拔干部当作自己经常的重要任务。不能从自己底部属中经常发现和培养提拔起足够的干部，而只是经常伸手向上级要人，这是
    一种对于“发现人材”的严重任务无能的表现。必须“如数家珍”一样地了解自己所属的干部，经常掌握一批经过挑选的准备培养和提拔的干部名单，并妥善地拟出教育、培养和提拔的计划。
    准备提拔作为干部的对象，除少数特殊情况需要与可以越级提拔者外，一般应采取逐级提拔的办法。挑选或提拔的过程，又是帮助和考验的过程。
    挑选时必须听取群众的意见，挑选后必须经常给以
    教育。必须按照一定的程序，经过有组织的审查，不得采取关门主义态度，也不得盲目与草率从事。对于经过挑选和提拔起来的新干部，各级领导者必须经常地具体地给以帮助，推动他们钻研业务，督促他们在政治上不断进步，教育他们密切和群众的联系，经常地有系统地提高他们的各种水平，以引导他们继续前进，并使之在群众中能迅速树立信仰，顺利完成各种任务。那些对新干部不帮助和不教育的不负责任的态度，对他们的错误采取单纯申斥或一脚踢开的官僚主义态度，或者把提拔他们不当作是为了事业的发展而是为着自己可以轻松的打算，都是错误的，必须加以纠正。
    指示指出：为了贯彻实现认真挑选、积极培养和大胆提拔干部的任务，必须反对在这些工作上的保守观点、关门主义、宗派思想、片面性和盲目性。保守观点看不到革命的发展，不顾全局，而把可以和应该提拔的干部长期保守在自己的周围不许他调，另一种是固守着“资格论”，对干部只看过去不看现在，忽视干部的进步，忽视新干部对革命的贡献。这是必须首先反对的。关门主义是拒绝新生干部更好地为人民服务，对新干部有过高的脱离实际的要求而不提拔，这些错误思想都障碍着新生力量的增长。宗派思想是以错误的干部标准把挑选、提拔干部只着眼在少数人身上，着眼在自己周围的小圈子里，这就必然使广大群众中的和干部中的人材被埋没起来。这是对革命事业非常有害的。片面性是只从个人观点的偏爱去挑选干部，不经过群众的了解，不作全面的考察，只根据一时一点的表现就提拔，这样往往不符合我们对干部的基本要求。盲目性表现在没有计划，没有明确的干部政策思想，因而往往不是为着工作而提拔干部，这样既达不到加强工作的目的，也达不到提高干部的目的。
    指示最后强调指出：没有足够数量和较高质量的干部队伍，就不能保证完成我们伟大的建设任务，而没有工业建设，就没有社会主义的前途，我们的革命就不能前进。因此各级党委在目前三反、五反后已有条件并十分需要的时候，应制订具体计划，大胆地、正确地和有组织地挑选提拔干部。
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】中共中央中南局最近发出关于积极发展新党员的指示，要求各地党委加强领导，以最积极的精神立即着手进行这个工作。
    指示说：三年来，中南全区经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革和城市工厂、矿山中的民主改革，尤其是最近半年来的三反、五反等一系列的群众运动，广大群众的政治觉悟已日益提高，并从运动中锻炼出大批优秀的积极分子，其中更有不少人经过多次运动的考验，一贯表现斗争积极，立场坚定，成为各种运动中的中坚人物，其中有许多人要求入党。因此从这些人当中吸收党员，建立党的组织，不仅条件具备，而且已经成为当前刻不容缓的政治任务。
    发展新党员之前应该充分做好准备工作。应从三反、五反和土地改革工作队中挑选有经验有能力的党员干部，委以组织员的任务，由他们拟出积极分子名单、做好发展党员计划，呈报上级党委批准，然后依照计划进行必要的考察工作，和培养、教育工作。但在准备发展新党员的地方，均应有组织有计划地大规模地进行关于党的宣传教育工作，更广泛地提高群众的政治觉悟和对党的认识。
    为了贯彻积极而又慎重的发展新党员的方针，必须克服在这个问题上的错误思想。当前要着重反对忽视建党工作的重要性。必须教育所有的党员干部，特别是实际担负建党工作的干部，深刻了解建党工作的严重政治意义和必须坚持党员标准的八项条件的道理，以严肃的态度来对待建党工作。
    指示最后指出：保证发展党的计划顺利完成的基本关键在于党委领导、全党动员和组织部门的具体管理。各级党委必须把发展党的工作提到议事日程的重要位置上来，认真地加以讨论布置和定期地进行检查督促；所有党员均必须在各自不同的岗位上担负一定的建党工作；党的基层组织必须经常地分配和检查每个党员的工作；各级组织部门应以最大力量，具体地指导发展党的工作，及时地总结经验，解决工作中所发生的问题和克服所发生的偏向。只有这样才能完成这一严肃而又巨大的政治任务。
