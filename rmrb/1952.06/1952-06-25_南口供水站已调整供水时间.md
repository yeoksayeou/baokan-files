    Nankou Water Supply Station Adjusts Water Supply Hours
    Editor: The suggestion "Nankou Water Supply Station Should Adjust Water Supply Hours" published on the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily on June 11th is correct. Based on user feedback, we have adjusted the water supply hours from May 30th to the following: 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Regarding the water supply methods and locations in Nankou Town, we are also studying the matter with relevant departments, and plan to appropriately increase the number of water vending stations and improve the water vending methods at unmanned stations to facilitate water access for the townspeople.

    南口供水站已调整供水时间
    编辑同志：六月十一日人民日报“读者来信专页”所载“南口供水站应调整供水时间”的建议是正确的。我们根据用户意见，从五月三十日起已经把供水时间改为早晨六时至九时，中午十二时至二时，下午五时至八时。关于南口镇供水办法及供水处所问题，我们也正和有关部门研究，准备适当增设售水站及改善无人售水站售水办法，以便利镇民用水。
