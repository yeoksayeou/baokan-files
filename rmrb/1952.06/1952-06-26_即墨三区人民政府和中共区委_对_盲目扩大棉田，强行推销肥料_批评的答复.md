Reply from the People's Government of the Third District of Jimo and the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Regarding Criticism of "Blindly Expanding Cotton Fields and Forcibly Selling Fertilizer"

To the Editor: The reader's letter from Comrade Wang Xinfeng published in the People's Daily reader's column on May 13, criticizing our district for "blindly expanding cotton fields and forcibly selling fertilizer," is basically correct, and we sincerely accept it.

In the work of expanding cotton fields (this year, the higher authorities asked our district to expand cotton fields in a planned way based on the soil conditions of our district), two townships in our district did commit the error of coercion and commandism. For example, Sun Yuwen, the deputy village head of Xiwagaozhuang, once said: "Whoever does not grow cotton will go to Taiwan." We immediately corrected this practice after discovering it. The criticism that "last year, the average farmer household planted four fen of cotton fields, and this year they are forced to plant an average of two mu per household" is inconsistent with the facts. Our district has 5,702 households, and last year they planted a total of 1,100 mu of cotton fields, averaging less than two fen per household. This year, the area has been slightly expanded in a planned manner, but it is not an average of two mu per household.

The phenomenon of forcibly selling fertilizer did occur in individual townships in our district. For example, Wang Baoye, a cadre of the bank, emphasized in Sun Yuwangtuan that village cadres should take the lead in buying, saying that whoever does not take the lead is a counter-revolutionary. We immediately corrected this situation after discovering it. The criticism that "肥田粉 [Feitianfen Fertilizer] costs 1,850 yuan per jin, while the price in Qingdao City at that time was 1,700 yuan," and that the district cooperative has a purely profit-seeking point of view; in reality, this fertilizer is transported from Qingdao, 140 li away, which requires transportation costs, and this price is uniformly stipulated by the county cooperative headquarters.

### 即墨三区人民政府和中共区委  对“盲目扩大棉田，强行推销肥料”批评的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    即墨三区人民政府和中共区委
    对“盲目扩大棉田，强行推销肥料”批评的答复
    编辑同志：五月十三日人民日报读者来信栏刊登了读者王心凤同志对我区“盲目扩大棉田，强行推销肥料”的批评，这个批评基本上是正确的，我们诚恳地接受。
    在扩大棉田工作中（今年上级根据我区土质情况，要我区有计划地扩大棉田），我区有两个乡确曾犯过强迫命令的错误。例如，西瓦戈庄的副村长孙玉文就曾说：“谁不种棉花，就到台湾去。”我们发现这种作法后，立即予以纠正。这个批评中说我区“去年平均每户农民种棉田四分，今年强制每户平均种二市亩”，这是和事实不符的。我区五千七百零二户，去年共种棉田一千一百亩，平均每户不到二分，今年有计划地稍加扩大，也不是平均每户种二市亩。
    我区个别乡确曾发生强行推销肥料的现象。如银行工作干部王保业，在孙于旺疃强调让村干部带头买，说谁不带头谁就是反革命分子。我们发现这种情况，立即纠正。批评中说肥田粉“每斤一千八百五十元，当时青岛市价一千七百元”，认为区合作社有单纯营利观点；实际这项肥田粉从一百四十里外的青岛运来，需要运费，而这价格是县合作总社统一规定的。
