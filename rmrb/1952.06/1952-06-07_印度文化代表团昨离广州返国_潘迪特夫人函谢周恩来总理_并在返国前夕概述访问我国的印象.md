Your Excellency:

As we prepare to leave your esteemed country, which has so generously received us, my delegation and I are mindful of the gratitude we owe to the Government and people of China for the many kindnesses and cordial hospitality shown to us during our stay. Please allow me, Your Excellency, to express our deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation.

Our visit to China has demonstrated that the traditional friendship between India and China is not merely a historical concept but a living reality. We sincerely hope that this friendship will continue to grow in all fields of ever-widening mutual understanding and cooperation and become a powerful factor in promoting world peace.

Please accept our most profound respects.

Respectfully,

Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit
Guangzhou, June 5, 1952

To His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 6th: On the eve of her return home, the head of the Indian Cultural Delegation, Mrs. Pandit, issued the following statement:

Five weeks ago, we came to China with a message of friendship from the Government and people of India – now it is time to say goodbye. Thanks to the kindness of the Central People's Government, we have seen many aspects of Chinese life. During our short visit, we gained rich impressions and memories, and we are pleased to find that the long-standing friendship between China and India is not only a historical concept but a living reality.

Everywhere we went, we were treated not only with your traditional hospitality but also with the most touching kindness and affection. Our smallest needs were anticipated, and our every wish was fulfilled. No words of thanks can adequately express our gratitude.

We visited famous universities, scientific and cultural institutions, factories, mines, rural areas implementing land reform, and last but not least, the great Huai River project. We were deeply impressed by the vibrant spirit of the people, liberated from oppression, driving them to create a prosperous and happy life for themselves through constant effort.

Since gaining independence four years ago, we have also been working tirelessly to make our country prosperous. We believe that China and India will have much to contribute to the future, and the common interests that unite us today are more important than the relations of the past. We hope that our existing friendship will continue to develop in an ever-widening scope of mutual understanding and cooperation and become a powerful factor in promoting world peace.

We wish China and the Chinese people continued and uninterrupted prosperity.

    印度文化代表团昨离广州返国
    潘迪特夫人函谢周恩来总理
    并在返国前夕概述访问我国的印象
    【新华社广州六日电】以潘迪特夫人为首的印度文化代表团一行二十三人，在广州参观了中山纪念堂、中山大学、岭南文物宫和越秀山等史迹、文物和名胜后，于六日离广州返国。前往欢送的有：广州市人民政府副市长梁广、广东省人民政府秘书长云广英和文教厅长杜国庠、华南文学艺术界联合会主席欧阳山和中央人民政府外交部亚洲司专员陈叔亮、刘柯等人。行前，省、市人民政府曾设宴饯行。
    潘迪特夫人离广州前，曾致函周恩来总理表示谢意。原函如下：阁下：
    当我们准备离开盛意招待我们的贵国的时候，我和我的代表团都意识到应该感谢贵国政府和中国人民，当我们在贵国逗留时期，对我们所表示的种种款待和盛情隆谊。阁下，请允许我表示我们深切的谢意和感激的心情。
    我们这次到中国来访问，证明了印度和中国之间的传统友谊不仅是一个历史概念而是一个活生生的现实。我们真诚地希望这种友谊将在日益阔广的互相了解和合作的各方面继续发展，并且成为促进世界和平的一个强有力的因素。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。此致
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府总理周恩来阁下                                                            
    维嘉雅·娜克希米·潘迪特一九五二年六月五日于广州
    【新华社上海六日电】印度文化代表团团长潘迪特夫人在返国前夕，发表谈话如下：
    五星期以前，我们带着印度政府和人民的友好的信息来到中国——现在已到了告别的时候了。由于中央人民政府的雅意，我们看到了中国生活的许多方面。我们在短时间的访问中，得到了丰富的印象和记忆，我们欣慰地发现中印两国间长久的友谊，不仅是一个历史的概念，而且是活的现实。
    我们到处不仅受到了你们历来所有的传统的殷勤款待，而且也受到了最感动人的善意和深情。我们最微小的需要都被事先预见到，我们的每个愿望都得到满足。没有任何感谢的话足以恰当地表示我们的感激。
    我们参观了著名的大学、科学和文化机构、工厂、矿山、实行土地改革后的农村以及最后但不是最不重要的地方，伟大的治淮工程。从人民中解放出来的蓬勃精神，推动了人民以不断的努力为他们自己创造富足、幸福的生活，这给予我们深刻的印象。
    我们自从四年前取得独立以来，也一直以不断的努力，使我们的国家繁荣。我们相信，中印两国对于将来会有很多的贡献，而今天把我们联在一起的共同利益，比过去的关系更为重要。我们希望我们已有的友谊，将在越来越广大的相互了解和合作的范围内继续发展，并成为促进世界和平的有力因素。
    敬祝中国和中国人民持续不断的繁荣。
