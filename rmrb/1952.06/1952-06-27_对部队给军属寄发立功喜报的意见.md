    Opinions on Troops Sending Meritorious Service Commendation Letters to Military Families
    Editor: After reading the article "Military Family Member Liu Shangde's Letter Arrived at the Korean Front" published in the People's Daily on June 6th, I thought about the issue of sending meritorious service commendation letters from the front lines back to the rear areas. This spring, when we went to the countryside to inspect the work of substitute farming, military families raised many opinions about meritorious service commendation letters. Many people said, "When the commendation letter arrives home, the village cadres and the masses don't pay any attention." After our investigation, the fact is this: When the commendation letter is forwarded to the village by the government, most of the time the masses are informed in advance, and they go to the military family's home with gongs and drums, which greatly encourages the military family and the masses. Only those meritorious service commendation letters that are sent directly home by the troops or the soldiers who performed the meritorious service, without going through the government, often pass by quietly because the cadres and the masses are unaware, and they do not play the due role politically. Therefore, I suggest that when the troops send meritorious service commendation letters to military families, they must send them to the people's governments at all levels, and the people's governments should forward them through appropriate forms.

### 对部队给军属寄发立功喜报的意见

    对部队给军属寄发立功喜报的意见
    编辑同志：读了六月六日人民日报刊载的朝鲜通讯“军属刘尚德的信到了朝鲜前线”一文后，我想起了由前线寄立功喜报回后方的问题。今年春季，我们下乡检查代耕工作时，军属给我们提了许多关于立功喜报的意见。很多人都说：“喜报寄到家了，乡村干部、群众都没有理会。”经我们了解，事实是这样的：喜报经政府转发到村，大多数都是事先告诉群众，由群众敲着锣鼓送到军属家里，这对军属、对群众都有着很大的鼓舞作用。惟有那些没有经过政府而由部队或立功战士直接寄回家的立功喜报，由于干部和群众都不知道，所以常常是静悄悄地便过去了，在政治上没有起到应有的作用。因此，我建议：部队寄立功喜报给军属，一定要寄给各级人民政府，由人民政府通过适当的形式转发下去。    尚嘉
