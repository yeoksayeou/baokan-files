    How the Nursery of Wuchang No. 19 Elementary School Was Established
    China Education Union, Central South Region Office
    Wuchang No. 19 Elementary School is located in the suburbs of Wuchang. The school has a total of thirty-nine teachers, with female teachers accounting for more than two-thirds of the total. Many female teachers with children urgently needed someone to take care of their children (all of whom were infants aged from one month to one and a half years). Initially, this problem was not properly resolved. Mothers had to leave their children with others, dropping them off in the morning and picking them up in the evening, in order to work and study; some hired nannies to take care of the children at home. On the surface, it seemed that the mothers' difficulties had been resolved and they were free to do things, but the mental burden on them was heavy, because the children always got sick after being left with others. The hired nannies also did not take good care of the children, and the children often wore wet diapers. This made the mothers worried, their "bodies in school, but hearts outside," which affected both their work and study.

    Therefore, the mothers urgently requested that there be a place in the school to care for the children. However, they made excessively high demands for the nursery: good housing, complete equipment, nannies with sanitary knowledge, and caregivers with higher cultural levels were required. They also hoped that the administrative side or the union could provide a sum of money to run it. In this way, the nursery could not be established, and the mothers' difficulties could not be resolved, of course.

    Under these circumstances, the grassroots welfare committee of the education union seized the opportunity to mobilize the mothers, making them realize that demanding too much without finding a way to solve the problem themselves would not work. Thus, the mothers gradually realized that they should not demand too much; they must proceed from reality and solve their own problems with their own strength. After this, the grassroots welfare committee of the union began to set up the nursery. To solve the housing and funding problems, they first sought assistance from the administrative side, and the mothers jointly bore the regular expenses—children's supplies and nannies' wages (which was cheaper than leaving the children with others or hiring someone to take care of them in the past). With the assistance of the administrative side, they persuaded the kitchen workers to move the kitchen to another side room; and under the leadership of the welfare committee members, the masses themselves whitewashed the black walls, filled in the ditches, and installed a ceiling, thus turning a dark kitchen into a delicate nursery.

    With housing and funding in place, the nursery was officially opened. This was indeed a great joy for the female teachers. Everyone in the school was happy about the establishment of the nursery, and the mothers sent their children's toys and supplies to the nursery; the art teacher also drew some beautiful pictures for the nursery, making it very beautiful. However, the system had not yet been established, and the mothers still had selfish ideas, all demanding that the nannies take extra care of their own children. As a result, there were disagreements between mothers, and between mothers and nannies. Every mother wanted to be in charge of things in the nursery, running to the nursery as soon as class was over, worrying about the nursery all day long. As a result, the nursery, which was established to solve problems, became a burden to them. After the grassroots committee of the education union learned about these situations, it first convened a meeting of all committee members, clearly defined leadership responsibilities, and drafted the management regulations for the nursery. After deliberation, a mothers' symposium was convened, and a nursery management committee was formed by the principal, female workers' welfare committee members, mothers, and union member representatives to manage all the work of the nursery. Various management systems were also established, such as: the nanny work system, "Mothers' Notice" and "Duty Officer's Notice," etc. The duty officers were rotated among the seven members of the management committee, and their task was to check the cleanliness of the nursery, the children's diet, etc., and to educate the nannies at any time. Because they recognized the benefits of the nursery to the entire school, the management committee was serious and responsible, and the mothers no longer worried about the nursery (for example, once the health vaccination station sent people to vaccinate students against smallpox, the duty officer immediately led them to the nursery to vaccinate the children, and the mothers did not even know about it). Because their lives were regular, the children also grew up well.

    After the establishment and improvement of the nursery system, the mothers were relieved and their work enthusiasm was increased. In the past, mothers had to hold their children while attending meetings, preparing lessons, and marking papers, and they also had to hold their children while studying; although they could not hold their children during class, they were still worried. Now, they no longer run to the nursery except during breastfeeding time. Some mothers who did not teach night school classes in the past have now started teaching night school classes.

    At the same time, the mothers' study has been strengthened, and they have also participated in social activities. Teacher Xu Junrong used to always hold her child while reading, and she could not read anything when the child made a fuss. Now, she says: "I must seize the time to study hard and improve myself." It is also convenient for mothers to participate in off-campus activities, such as listening to reports.

    In the process of establishing and improving the work of the nursery, the mothers' collectivist thinking has also been improved. When the children first entered the nursery, the boundaries between the mothers were very clear, and toilet paper and soap were used separately, for fear that other people's children would use too much and they would suffer losses. However, as the work of the nursery was continuously improved, they realized that it was easier and more economical to solve problems collectively than individually. Thus, their selfish and self-interested thoughts were slowly weakened, and the children's habits of collective life were also cultivated.

    Now all the children of the No. 19 Elementary School have entered the nursery (except for one with tuberculosis). Teacher Qiu, who has just taken maternity leave, said: "The nursery is really good. After my one-month maternity leave is over, I will definitely send my baby and two-year-old child to the nursery together."

    武昌第十九小学的托儿间是怎样建立起来的
    中国教育工会中南区办事处
    武昌第十九小学设在武昌的郊区。全校共有教师三十九人，女教师占全体教师的三分之二强。很多有孩子的女教师，都迫切需要有人照顾孩子（这些孩子全是一月以上至一岁半的幼儿）。最初，这一问题没有得到适当解决。妈妈们为了工作和学习，不得不把孩子寄放在别人家里，早上送去，晚上接回；有的雇褓姆来家里照管孩子。表面上看来，妈妈们的困难似乎解决了，能脱手做事情了，但是她们精神上的负担是重的，因为孩子寄放到别人家里以后总是闹病。雇来的褓姆对孩子的照顾也不够好，孩子常穿尿湿的裤子。这样就使妈妈们放心不下，“身在学校，心在外面”，工作学习都受到了影响。
    因此，妈妈们迫切要求着学校里能有一个托孩子的地方。但她们对托儿间提出的要求太高了：要好房子，设备要完善，要请有卫生常识的褓姆，还要有文化水平较高的保育员。她们更希望行政方面或工会能拿出一笔钱来办。这样，托儿间就无法办了，母亲们的困难当然也得不到解决。
    在这种情况下，教育工会基层福利委员便抓紧机会在母亲中进行了动员，使大家认识到要求过高而自己又不想办法是解决不了问题的。于是母亲们逐渐认识了不能要求过高；必须从实际出发，用自己的力量解决自己的问题。这以后，工会基层福利委员会就着手举办托儿间。为了解决房子和经费问题，他们首先争取行政方面的帮助，并由妈妈们共同负担经常的费用——儿童用费及褓姆的工资（这较过去把孩子交给别人或雇人照管都要便宜）。在行政方面的协助下说服了厨房工友，将厨房移到另一个侧屋里去；并在福利委员的带头下，群众自己动手，把黑墙刷白，把水沟填平，装置了天花板，这样便将一个黑洞洞的厨房，变成了精致的托儿间。
    房子和经费都有了，托儿间就正式开办起来。这对于女教师们说来的确是一件大喜事。学校里的人都为托儿间的建立而高兴，母亲们把孩子的玩具、用具都送进了托儿间；美术教师也给托儿间画了几张漂亮的画，把托儿间布置得很美观。但是制度还没有建立起来，妈妈们又存有自私观念，都要求褓姆对自己的孩子照管得格外周到些。结果就使得妈妈和妈妈之间、妈妈和褓姆之间有了意见。对托儿间里的事，每个妈妈都想作主，一下了课就往托儿间里跑，成天都为托儿间的事情操心。结果这个为解决问题而设立的托儿间，反而成了她们的包袱。教育工会基层委员会了解了这些情况以后，先召开了全体委员会议，明确确定了领导责任，拟出了托儿间的管理章程。经过酝酿，召开了妈妈座谈会，又由校长、女工福利委员、妈妈和工会会员代表共同组成了托儿间管理委员会，管理托儿间的全部工作。并订出了各种管理制度，如：褓姆工作制度，“妈妈须知”和“值日员须知”等。值日员由管理委员会的七个委员轮流担任，任务是检查托儿间的清洁，儿童的饮食等，并随时对褓姆进行教育。由于认识了托儿间对整个学校的好处，管理委员会做到了认真负责，妈妈们对托儿间的事完全不操心了（如有一次卫生接种站派人给学生种牛痘，值日员马上领他们到托儿间去给孩子们种好了牛痘，妈妈们都还不知道）。因为生活有规律，孩子们也都长得好了。
    托儿间建立和制度健全了以后，妈妈们都安心了，提高了工作热情。以前，妈妈们开会时要抱着孩子，准备课程、改卷子时也要抱着孩子，学习时也要抱着孩子；上课时虽不能抱孩子，却又放不下心。现在，除了喂奶的时间进托儿间以外，他们不再往那里跑了。从前有的妈妈不担任夜校课程，现在也开始教夜校的课了。
    同时，妈妈们的学习加强了，也参加了社会活动。徐俊容老师以前老是抱着孩子看书，孩子一闹，啥也看不下去。现在，她说：“我一定抓紧时间好好学习，提高自己。”妈妈们参加校外活动，如听报告等，也方便了。
    在建立和改进托儿间工作的过程中，妈妈们的集体主义思想也提高了。在孩子刚进托儿间时，妈妈们彼此间的界限分得很清，草纸和肥皂都分开用，怕别人的孩子用多了，自己吃亏。但由于托儿间的工作不断改进，使她们认识到：用集体的方法解决问题，比个别地解决问题，要容易些、节约些。于是慢慢地减弱了她们的自私自利的思想，同时也培养了孩子们的集体生活的习惯。
    现在第十九小学的全部小孩都进了托儿间（除一个有结核病的以外）。有一个刚请产假的邱老师说：“托儿间真好，等一月产假满后，我一定把婴儿和两岁大的孩子一块送到托儿间里来。”
