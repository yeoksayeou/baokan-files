Visiting Indonesian Representatives Suwati and Suryonegoro

    Suwati is one of the initiators of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, the leader of the "Indonesian Women's Awakening Association," and a member of the Indonesian Parliament. Suryonegoro is an Indonesian national capitalist. During the interview, they both powerfully reflected, based on their personal experiences, the Indonesian people's ardent desire and demand for peace, who have been deeply affected by the disasters of imperialist war policies.

    "From my personal experience, I have deeply understood the meaning of war." Suryonegoro told the reporter: he participated in the Indonesian national independence movement in 1945. Recalling those days of struggle filled with national blood and tears, he felt infinite emotion. "The Indonesian people paid such a huge price and sacrifice for national independence." He said, "However, although our country is said to be independent, it has not brought happiness. The shackles of the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference agreement still prevent us from turning over!"

    Suryonegoro has been involved in the business community since September 1949. He is now the general manager of Indonesian Wumei Ayu Trading Co., Ltd. and a representative of five Indonesian national capital-operated companies. He said, "As a national capitalist, I love my motherland. I hope to strive for the nation's true independence and economic prosperity." However, under the suffocation of foreign monopoly capital, the heart of this young Indonesian national industrialist and businessman is filled with worries and distress: his motherland, the Indonesian archipelago, has fertile tropical land and abundant resources such as rubber, quinine, coconut, and oil, which have been coveted by imperialist robbers for many years. However, the Indonesian people have not benefited from their hard work and sweat. The 350-year rule of the Dutch colonists has always regarded Indonesia as a sales market for imperialist goods and a source of cheap raw materials. Foreign monopoly capital, with the most barbaric plunder and the most backward production methods, has kept Indonesia's economy in a colonial state completely subordinate to imperialism for a long time.

    Suryonegoro said: "According to the Round Table Conference agreement, foreign monopoly capital still controls the entire economic lifeline of Indonesia. Indonesia does not have its own national industry, and daily necessities rely entirely on foreign imports. The raw materials we export cannot be exchanged for the machinery we need to develop industry, and market prices are entirely controlled by foreign capitalists." Under such circumstances, Indonesia's economic situation is deteriorating day by day, with inflation, rising prices, and increasingly impoverished people's lives. He said: The monthly wages of Indonesian workers are only enough for ten days of expenses. Foreign capital has destroyed Indonesia's economic life, while the majority of farmers cannot concentrate on agricultural production due to unresolved land issues. He told reporters that serious famines have been caused in West Java, Cirebon, Kediri... and other places due to abandoned fields and lack of food.

    After World War II, American monopoly capital took the opportunity to expand into Indonesia on a large scale, dragging the Indonesian economy into an even deeper abyss of deterioration. When Suwati and Suryonegoro talked to reporters about the current economic situation in Indonesia, they both unanimously stated the serious harm of imperialist war policies and so-called "aid" to the Indonesian economy. "The United States advertises 'aid' to backward countries, but this aid is not sincere." Suwati said, "What we need most are machines and tractors, but the United States is dumping luxury goods such as perfume and glass stockings in large quantities to Indonesia. This is not aid. American loans are conditional, and it is using loans to control our economic lifeline." They pointed out that since Indonesia implemented the "embargo" in June 1951, it has caused serious consequences. Suwati made a sharp comparison of rubber prices before and after the "embargo." She said, "Before the embargo, Indonesian crepe rubber (referring to natural rubber sheets) was 11 guilders (Indonesian currency) per kilogram, but now it has fallen to 3.5 guilders per kilogram." The rubber industry is the economic lifeline of Indonesia. The foreign exchange earned from Indonesian rubber exports accounts for about 54 percent of Indonesia's total foreign exchange. On the island of Sumatra, 80 to 90 percent of the Indonesian people in many places rely on income from rubber production to make a living. The success or failure of the rubber business directly affects the lives of local people and the prosperity of other industries and commerce. As a result of the United States' arbitrary suppression of rubber prices, Suryonegoro estimated that "Indonesia has lost about 50 to 60 percent of its foreign exchange." The facts are very clear that following the United States' trade policy has been a complete failure. Therefore, the Indonesian people's voice against this unreasonable trade policy of the United States is growing louder and louder. Suwati said: "Indonesian newspapers have been constantly protesting, questioning the authorities why they do not establish trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and people's democratic countries to seek new outlets." In particular, Indonesian national capitalists are more eager to change this deteriorating economic situation. Suryonegoro said: "Indonesian national capitalists are eagerly hoping to establish trade relations with the Soviet Union and China. This demand has become more obvious and more urgent in recent times!"

    When talking about the current development and characteristics of the Indonesian peace movement, Suwati said: "The Indonesian people's desire for peace is inseparable from the demand for improving their impoverished lives. Therefore, the Indonesian people's demand for peace is universal and enthusiastic." She summarized the development of the Indonesian peace movement since 1950 to the reporters and said:

    "Despite the many obstacles to the Indonesian peace movement, it is still developing broadly. The celebration of May Day in 1951 was centered on defending peace and unfolded a wide range of activities. This year's May Day, the Indonesian people also gathered to celebrate and protested against the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare." The Indonesian people's movement for peace is rising higher and higher. She said: "More than 500,000 Indonesian people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and by April 1952, the number of signatures supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers had exceeded 600,000."

    Suwati and Suryonegoro unanimously believe that convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is of great significance. Suryonegoro said: "The Asian and Pacific region is a place that produces important strategic raw materials, and now these raw materials are being used by aggressor countries to wage war. We believe that if the people of this region unite, the danger of war can be stopped." Suwati said: "Only by obtaining peace can we guarantee a happy life for mankind." Therefore, she sincerely congratulated the success of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and hoped that "the conference will reach a resolution and use concrete methods to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific region!"

    访印度尼西亚代表苏瓦蒂和苏约尼哥罗
    苏瓦蒂是印尼参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起人之一、“印尼觉醒妇女会”的领袖和印尼国会的议员。苏约尼哥罗是印尼的民族资本家。记者在访问他们的时候，他们都以自己的切身经验，有力地反映了深受帝国主义战争政策灾害的印尼人民对于和平的热切愿望和要求。
    “我从亲身的体验中，已深深懂得了战争的意义是什么？”苏约尼哥罗告诉记者：他曾经参加一九四五年印尼民族独立运动。他回忆那充满了民族的血泪的斗争日子，引起了无限的感慨。“印尼人民为了争取民族的独立，曾经付出了多么巨大的代价和牺牲。”他说：“但是，我们的国家虽说是独立了，却并没有带来幸福。印荷圆桌会议协定的枷锁，使我们仍然翻不了身！”
    苏约尼哥罗自一九四九年九月以后即投身工商界，他现在是印尼巫美阿尤贸易有限公司的总经理，和五个印尼民族资本所经营的企业公司的代表。他说：“作为一个民族资本家，我热爱自己的祖国。我希望争取民族的真正独立与经济的繁荣。”但是，在外国垄断资本窒息下，这位年青的印尼民族工商业家的胸中，交织着的是忧患与苦闷：他的祖国——印度尼西亚群岛上，有着热带肥沃的土地和橡胶、金鸡纳霜、椰子、石油等丰富的物产、资源，多少年来都是帝国主义强盗垂涎的地方。但是，印尼人民并没有从自己的劳动血汗中得到好处。荷兰殖民者三百五十年的统治，一直把印尼当作帝国主义商品的销售市场和廉价原料的来源地。外国垄断资本用最野蛮的掠夺和最落后的生产方式，使印尼的经济长期停留在完全从属于帝国主义的殖民地地位。
    苏约尼哥罗说：“根据圆桌会议的协定，外国垄断资本现在依然把持着印尼全部经济命脉。印尼没有自己的民族工业，日用必需品要全靠外国输入。我们出口的原料换不来我们发展工业需要的机器，市场价格完全听任外国资本家操纵。”在这样的情况下，印尼经济局势便一天比一天恶化，通货膨胀、物价高涨、人民生活越来越穷困。他说：现在印尼工人每月所得的工资，只够十天的开销。外国资本破坏了印尼的经济生活，而广大农民则因土地问题没有解决，不能安心进行农业生产。他告诉记者：在西爪哇、井里汶、谏义里……等地，已因田园荒芜缺乏粮食酿成了严重饥荒。
    第二次世界大战以后，美国垄断资本乘机向印尼大肆扩张，更把印尼经济拖向进一步恶化的深渊。苏瓦蒂和苏约尼哥罗在和记者们谈到目前印尼的经济局势时，都一致说明了帝国主义战争政策与所谓“援助”对于印尼经济的严重危害。“美国宣传‘援助’落后国家，这种援助并不是真心真意的。”苏瓦蒂说：“我们最需要的是机器和拖拉机，而美国向印尼大量倾销的却是香水、玻璃袜子等奢侈品，这不是援助。美国的借款是有条件的，它正利用借款来控制我们的经济命脉。”他们指出：印尼自从一九五一年六月实行“禁运”以来，已造成了严重的恶果，苏瓦蒂把“禁运”前后橡胶的价格作了一个尖锐的对比，她说：“禁运前，印尼自造烟花片（指天然胶片）每公斤合十一盾（印尼币名），现在每公斤已落到三·五盾。”橡胶业是印尼的经济生命线。印尼橡胶出口所得的外汇占印尼外汇总额百分之五十四左右。在苏门答腊岛，许多地方百分之八九十的印尼人民都依靠生产橡胶的收入为生。橡胶生意好坏，直接影响当地人民生活与其他工商业的繁荣。美国蛮横地压低橡胶价格的结果，据苏约尼哥罗估计：“印尼损失外汇约在百分之五十到六十左右”。事实十分清楚，追随美国贸易政策是完全破产了。因此，印尼人民反对美国的这种不合理的贸易政策的呼声是越来越大了。苏瓦蒂说：“印尼报纸已不断提出抗议，纷纷质问当局为什么不和苏联、中国及人民民主国家建立贸易关系，以寻求新的出路。”特别是印尼的民族资本家，要求改变这种恶化的经济现状，表现更为迫切。苏约尼哥罗说：“印尼的民族资本家都热烈希望和苏联、中国建立贸易关系。这种要求最近时期以来是更加明显、更加迫切了！”
    谈到目前印尼和平运动发展的情况与特点时，苏瓦蒂说：“印尼人民渴望和平是与要求改善穷困的生活分不开的。因而印尼广大人民要求和平，是普遍而热烈的。”她向记者们概括地叙述了印尼和平运动自从一九五○年开始以来的发展情况之后说：
    “尽管印尼的和平运动受到多方的阻碍，但是和平运动仍在广泛地向前发展着。一九五一年庆祝五一劳动节就是以保卫和平为中心展开了广泛活动的。今年的五一劳动节，印尼人民也集会举行了庆祝，并抗议美国进行细菌战。”印尼人民要求和平的运动是越来越高涨了。她说：“印尼人民有五十多万人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名，到一九五二年四月，拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名已超过六十万人。”
    苏瓦蒂和苏约尼哥罗一致认为：召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议具有重大的意义。苏约尼哥罗说：“亚洲及太平洋区域是出产重要战略原料的地方，现在这些原料正被侵略国家利用来进行战争。我们相信，如果这个地区的人民一致团结起来，战争危险是可以制止的。”苏瓦蒂说：“只有获得和平，才能保证人类过幸福的生活。”因此，她热诚祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功，并希望：“通过此次会议达成决议，用具体办法保卫亚洲和太平洋区域的和平！”　（孔东平）
