I Want to Sing Their Praises
Bai Lang

"I can proudly say that the women of Korea are heroic women!" General Kim Il-sung said to us with confidence. The smile on the corner of his mouth and the corner of his eyes showed how sublime his national pride was. It was just like the pride of a mother when she talks about her lovely children. I thought, isn't this precisely the pride of the leader of the Korean people?

Our great leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Peng Dehuai, also earnestly instructed us: "The Korean nation is a brave nation full of the spirit of struggle. They possess the same advantages as the Chinese nation - diligence, simplicity, heroic tenacity, high national consciousness, and the greatest endurance, especially the women." He emphasized, "Our writers should sing their praises well."

Yes, we should sing their praises well, just like singing the praises of the heroic sisters of our great motherland. However, every time I pick up my pen, I deeply feel that I lack fresh and powerful language, so how can I depict their joyous, fresh, beautiful, and healthy images appropriately?

Since the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, I have had the opportunity to come into contact with revolutionary and working Korean women. Over time, I have come to understand them and have developed sincere respect and love for them. Their selfless labor, selfless patriotic loyalty, and indomitable fighting spirit deeply moved me; they live so optimistically in a suffering land and fight in an extraordinary struggle.

People who have not been to Korea can hardly imagine how difficult the lives of the Korean people have been for the past two years. The blood of peaceful residents has stained the humiliated land red, and the bones of martyrs are buried in ruins where not a blade of grass remains. In those rubble piles, you can easily find the severed limbs of children and the hair of women. American aerial bandits sow the seeds of evil in the Korean sky, and their bloody claws are creating disasters every minute. On the Korean Peninsula, you can hardly find a complete family or a woman who has not lost a loved one. How rare and precious the phrase "family reunion" sounds to them!

But, you simply cannot believe that although their experiences are so tragic and their lives are so difficult, words like "miserable," "sad," and "bitter" cannot be easily applied to them, even if you are out of sympathy and pity. In my interactions with them, they never gave me that kind of feeling.

Last May, when the International Women's Investigation Group arrived in North Korea, they were warmly welcomed by Korean sisters everywhere. They wore festive clothes, held flowers tied with colored ribbons, and lined up for miles in the pure white moonlight to welcome friends from eighteen countries who uphold justice and humanity. The sound of battle songs drowned out the roar of enemy planes in the sky. Their joyful cheers resounded through the valleys, making people hallucinate that this was not a land ravaged by war, but that people in a peaceful country were celebrating some grand festival!

According to the imagination of ordinary human sentiment, these unfortunate people who have suffered so much must have been tormented by sorrow, unable to stand up straight, unable to lift their heads. Because the separation of loved ones, the destruction of fields and homes, must result in disheveled hair, haggard appearance, and days of tears and sighs, how could they still have a happy mood? How could they even have the interest to dress up? What was presented to us, however, was a completely unexpected scene.

Looking at the excited faces, the brightly colored clothes, and the neatly styled hair, listening to the healthy singing and laughter, many delegates couldn't help but be surprised: "Are their experiences really so tragic? Is their life really so difficult?" After more contact, everyone realized that this was precisely the characteristic of Korean women. They have been tempered like steel in long-term suffering. The reason they are excited and joyful is precisely because they believe in their own strength. The reason they endure is precisely because they hold fervent hope for a bright future.

"Korean women do not shed tears. Why? Have they run out of tears?" I once thought.

There is a chairman of the Democratic Women's Union from South Korea (I can't remember her name for a moment), whose parents, children, husband... a family of eleven relatives were all killed by the enemy, but she is still full of energy and fighting for peace. On her calm face,

I couldn't find a trace of discouragement, and I didn't see her shed a single tear.

This is by no means an isolated phenomenon. Many Korean women I have encountered have similar characteristics. When they describe the tragic deaths of their loved ones, they are like telling an old story, without tears or sighs; but in their angry eyes, I can see such determination: "This blood debt must be repaid in blood by those who owe it!" When they watch their homes being destroyed by enemy planes, they do not despair or wail, but instead hold up their unyielding chests and turn their tears into firm vows: "Robbers, destroy! You have destroyed my house, but you cannot destroy my tenacious will. I will always arrange my life according to my own wishes, and never according to yours!" In this way, on that desolate ruin, small houses built from broken tiles and bricks reappeared. One day, we stood on the dilapidated roof of the Sinuiju Cultural Palace and saw many women and children below diligently and joyfully building

a beautiful garden in a pile of rubble. Enemy planes buzzed overhead, but they looked at them with arrogance, as if saying, "Robbers, look! You have destroyed our beautiful life, but we will definitely rebuild it!"

However, do Korean women really not shed tears? No, they do. When the Chinese People's Volunteers marched mightily across the Yalu River, they shed tears; when the Chinese People's Volunteers shed their blood and liberated their homeland, they shed tears; when the Chinese People's Volunteers rescued their lives and property regardless of their own safety, they shed tears; when the Chinese People's Volunteers helped them produce and save food to relieve their famine, they shed tears; when various brotherly countries gave them selfless assistance, they shed tears;... They only let their tears flow freely when they are filled with surging enthusiasm, gratitude, love, and admiration. How many times, in their affectionate embraces, did our tears of friendship flow together and soak our clothes!

Their character is: both gentle and firm; their feelings are: clear-cut love and hate. They know how to love their friends; and they know even better how to hate their enemies. On the Korean battlefield, not only have many stories of the Volunteer Army loving the people been produced; but also many stories of the people loving the Volunteer Army have been circulated. Here is the most common example -

One freezing morning, outside a cave of a heavy wounded hospital of the Volunteer Army, an old Korean lady in her seventies was pacing back and forth. She was carrying a basket of freshly steamed buns, anxiously waiting to meet her relative. She told the nurse that she had only heard last night that Zhang Wanhhou had been wounded and transferred here, so she milled the wheat that was to be kept as seeds overnight and steamed this basket of buns. She repeatedly requested:

"If you don't let me see him, you must leave these buns for him!"

"It's not that we don't want you to see him, Aunt Zhao." The nurses addressed her affectionately because everyone knew her; she was the old lady Zhao Deshi who had recently recovered from her injuries and been discharged from here. "His injuries are very serious. During the dangerous period, no one is allowed to visit; as for these buns, how can he eat them?"

When Aunt Zhao heard that her relative's life was in danger, her face immediately turned pale. She paced anxiously for a long time before leaving disappointedly with the basket.

From that day on, Aunt Zhao came once every day. She walked on that frozen mountain road, slipping and sliding in the face of the severe cold north wind, and returned with disappointment and anxiety every day.

A week passed, and she seemed even older, but Zhang Wanhhou finally survived the dangerous period, and the hospital finally allowed the old lady to visit. She rushed into the ward in three steps and jumped to Zhang Wanhhou's bedside. When Zhang Wanhhou saw Aunt Zhao, who was carrying buns and staggering, he forgot the pain and was so moved that he forgot to ask anything, just hugged her neck tightly and called out: "You are my best, best Korean mother!" Aunt Zhao said in a trembling voice: "You are my best, best Chinese son." At this time, she clearly remembered, "How the enemy had beaten her severely before retreating, and then buried her alive with many compatriots. When the Volunteer Army came to rescue her, she was already dying, and all her limbs were crushed. The soldier Zhang Wanhhou rescued her, immediately carrying her to this hospital regardless of fatigue, and then went to chase the team. Unexpectedly, it was so coincidental..." Thinking of this, the old lady hugged Zhang Wanhhou even tighter, murmuring repeatedly:

"You are my best, best Chinese son, the best..."

The kind Korean women love their army and friends with the tenderness of women and the compassion of mothers, while at the same time using brave and decisive actions to deal with their enemies. The actions of Li Shaonv, the chairman of the Women's Union of Suwon County, Hwanghae Province, are a concrete example -

During the army's retreat the year before last, Li Shaonv did not retreat with the army. One day, seventeen enemy soldiers came to her hiding place and ordered her to cook for them. She claimed that she was going to borrow rice, and took the opportunity to send someone to notify the guerrillas. But in order to buy time, what she borrowed was not rice but paddy, so she sat in the courtyard and pretended to be busy pushing and grinding. However, the food was cooked, but there was no sign of the guerrillas. She always believed that the guerrillas would come, how could she delay a few more minutes? Seeing that the enemies were about to finish eating. She came up with an idea and went into the kitchen, took down a string of dried chilies from the wall, and quickly ground them into powder. She thought proudly: "If I can't catch you, I'll let you eat something spicy." When she walked into the room, the enemies were gobbling and chewing, she bit her lip, and with lightning speed, she scattered a large bowl of bright red chili powder like sowing seeds on the faces of the enemies. As a result, thirty-four murderous eyes could no longer be opened. While they were struggling in embarrassment, the guerrillas arrived, and none of the seventeen enemies was able to escape.

In addition, there are countless Korean heroines and female laborers who, in order to preserve national integrity, to strictly guard secrets, and even to resist the humiliation of beasts, gritted their teeth and endured their husbands being brutally killed, watching their children being stabbed to death on the tips of the enemy's knives, and finally became fearless martyrs themselves. Thousands upon thousands of tragic deeds are a great epic written in blood.

Since the outbreak of the war, all the young and middle-aged men who have not been killed have bravely gone to the front lines. What remains, apart from the old, weak, and disabled, are mostly hardworking women. Therefore, they have become the main labor force in the rear. Regardless of enemy bombing and the difficulty of lacking seeds, livestock, and agricultural tools, they bravely put forward the slogan of "Guarantee production with our strength." In this way, with the help of manpower and materials from the army and the government, they completed the spring plowing task in 1951 fifteen days ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 102%. If it hadn't been for the flood disaster, last year's harvest would have been very abundant.

Kim Rak-hee, a labor hero from Gyecheon County, is a nineteen-year-old girl who is not in good health and has no production experience; but after her father was brutally killed by the enemy, she decided to fight to "send one more grain of rice to the front line." As a result, she not only completed her entire plan of plowing 4,000 pyeong of land, but also helped households without labor to plow 15,000 pyeong of land and chopped 60 tons of horse grass. She produced 29 more bags of rice than her father had produced before his death, and finally realized her wish to dedicate patriotic rice to General Kim Il-sung.

On the industrial production front, many female labor heroes have also emerged. But, don't forget, under what kind of crazy bombing threats did they persist in their production. At the Korean State-owned Textile Factory, we had the honor of meeting Tang Yun-sil, a silk-reeling hero who had won many awards and attended the International Textile Conference. She is just a girl who has just turned twenty, but she has become a nationally known hero. In peacetime, her production volume was 400%; after the outbreak of the war, her increased efforts resulted in her production volume exceeding 50% of her peacetime production volume. Her productivity is so amazing, but when she reported her production achievements to us, she was so simple and humble. She had been to China last spring, and she said, "The Chinese movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has given me too much education and moved me deeply. The deeds of Comrade Hao Jianxiu have given me great help and encouragement."

Korean women are not only heroes on the production front, but also indispensable forces for guaranteeing transportation and supporting the front lines. When you are sitting in a car and speeding on a flat highway, you cannot help but be grateful for their contribution. In the ranks of migrant workers repairing pontoon bridges and laying mud roads, you can often see their active figures. They wield the most primitive tools, shoveling sand and stones one shovel at a time, their feet inserted in the mud, and the mud splashes all over their white clothes. The joyful laughter and tireless singing will make you feel that they are carefree. However, perhaps when they return home from work, there is no rice in the pot, or even a change of clothes and an extra pair of shoes.

There are often such situations: the road that you once got stuck on the day before, when you return on the same road the next day, the road has been repaired as smooth as an asphalt road. And when the women repairing the road pass by you in your car, they will wave and cheer at you, as if showing the victory of their labor and wishing you a safe journey.

On the front lines of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, female medical personnel and female members of the cultural troupe naturally come and go frequently, and the footprints of working women also appear frequently. During periods of intense fighting and difficult supply, in order to guarantee the victory of the war, the women did not avoid dangers, braved enemy strafing, and crossed layers of fire, carrying hundreds of pounds of ammunition from the rear dozens of miles away to the front line. When they went down, they carried the wounded back to the rear. In the most difficult days of the war, the soldiers on the front line often couldn't eat for two or three days. The women in the enemy-occupied areas were unwilling to let the brave men who defended the country go hungry. They would rather not eat or sleep themselves, but collect grain, grind flour overnight, and secretly make bags of "dalgona," and then secretly send them to the front line. However, there will be sacrifices to pass through the enemy's artillery fire. Fearing that the dry food would not reach the mouths of the warriors, they organized themselves in a planned way. To send a sack of "dalgona," five or six women had to go. They formed a line with considerable distance and advanced carefully. If one in front fell down, the person behind immediately carried the bag, stepped on the fresh blood, and rushed forward bravely.

On the heroic fighting Korean Peninsula, such moving deeds are being spread everywhere. Female heroes and national martyrs are emerging every day. Women have grown into an invincible force to resist aggression. Unfortunately, my records are not at hand, and relying only on fragmented memories is not enough to describe their courage in the slightest.

The hardworking and brave Korean sisters truly deserve the title of "hero." Their excellent qualities cannot help but be loved. Although my praise is far less inspiring than the facts, I still want to sing their praises. Because, I will always sing the praises of those I love.

Dear Korean heroic women, I would like to extend my most cordial greetings and highest respect to you as a sister and comrade-in-arms! Dear sisters, fight even more bravely, your struggle is never isolated.

### 我要歌颂她们

    我要歌颂她们
    白朗
    “我可以自豪地讲一句：朝鲜的妇女是英雄的妇女！”金日成将军满怀自信地对我们说。他那嘴角上、眼角上展现着的微笑，是流露着多么崇高的民族的自豪感。正像一个母亲谈到她可爱的儿女时那种母亲的骄傲一样。我想，这不正是朝鲜人民领袖的骄傲吗？
    我们伟大的人民志愿军领袖彭德怀将军也曾恳切地指示过我们：“朝鲜民族是一个富于斗争精神的勇敢的民族。他们具备着和中国民族同样的优点——勤劳朴素、英勇顽强、有着高度的民族自觉和最大的忍耐力，特别是妇女。”他着重地说，“我们的作家，应该很好地歌颂她们。”
    是的，我们应该很好地歌颂她们，正像歌颂我们伟大祖国的英雄姊妹们一样。可是，每当我提起笔来的时候，便深深地感到我缺乏的是清新有力的语言，又怎能把她们那种喜悦、新鲜、美丽、健康的形象描绘得恰如其分呢？
    抗美援朝以来，我有机会和朝鲜革命的、劳动的妇女接触，天长日久，我了解了她们，对她们产生了衷心的敬爱。她们忘我的劳动、无私的爱国忠诚和永不屈服的顽强斗志，深深感动了我；她们是那样乐观地生活在受难的土地上，战斗在不平凡的斗争中。
    没有到过朝鲜的人，很难想像到两年来的朝鲜人民是过着怎样苦难的日子。和平居民的鲜血染红了被侮辱的土地，烈士的白骨掩埋在寸草不留的废墟上。在那些瓦砾堆中，你可以随便翻到孩子的残肢和女人的头发。美国空中强盗在朝鲜的天空撒下罪恶的种子，他们血淋淋的魔爪，每分钟都在制造着灾难。在朝鲜半岛上，你几乎找不到一个完整的家庭和一个没有丧失亲人的妇女。“一家团聚”这个美满幸福的词句，在她们听来，是多末稀罕、多末珍贵呵！
    可是呵，你简直无法相信，她们的遭遇尽管如此惨痛，生活尽管如此艰苦，而像“凄惨”“悲哀”和“辛酸”……这一类的字眼，是不能随便按在她们头上的，纵使你是出于同情和怜惜。在我和她们的交往当中，她们一点都没给过我那样的感觉。
    去年五月，国际妇女调查团到达北朝鲜时，到处受到朝鲜姊妹们的热烈欢迎。她们穿着节日的服装，捧着结着彩绸的鲜花，在洁白的月夜里，排成几里长的行列，迎接来自十八个国家、主持正义和人道的朋友们。那一片战斗的歌声，竟淹没了空中敌机的吼叫。她们愉快的欢呼，响彻山谷，简直使人幻觉到这不是在被战争蹂躏的土地上，而是和平国家的人民在庆祝着什么盛大的节日呵！
    按照一般人情的想像，这些灾难深重的不幸者，一定被悲哀折磨得挺不起腰来了，抬不起头来了。因为骨肉离散、田园破毁，必然是蓬头垢面、形容憔悴，过着流泪和叹息的日子，哪里还会有欢笑的心情呢？更怎会有打扮的兴致呢？而摆在我们面前的，却完全是出人意外的景象。
    看着那一个个兴奋的脸、鲜艳的服装以及修饰得整齐的头发，听着那健康的歌唱和笑声，好多代表不禁吃惊了：“她们的遭遇真是那样悲惨吗？她们的生活真是那样艰苦吗？”接触多了，大家才领悟到：这原来正是朝鲜妇女的特点。她们在长期的苦难中，经历千锤百炼，已经像钢铁般坚强。她们之所以兴奋喜悦，正是因为相信自己的力量。她们之所以忍耐，正是因为对光辉的未来抱着热切的希望。
        “朝鲜妇女是不流眼泪的。为什么呢？难道她们的眼泪都流干了吗？”我曾经这样想过。
    有一个原籍南朝鲜的民主妇女同盟委员长（一时想不起她的名字），她的父母、儿女、丈夫……一家十一口亲人全被敌人杀掉了，而她却依然是精神饱满地为和平而奋斗不息。在她那付沉静的面孔上，
    一点都找不出气馁的表情，我也没有看见她滴过一颗泪水呀。
    这决不是个别的现象，在我碰到的很多朝鲜妇女，都有着类似的特点。当她们叙述着自己亲人惨死的情景时，竟像讲着古老的故事一样，没有眼泪，也没有叹息；但在她们那愤怒的眼光里，我却可以看出这样的决心：“这笔血债一定要欠债者用血来还！”当她们眼看着自己的家屋毁于敌机之下时，她们没有绝望，没有嚎哭，反而挺起不屈服的胸膛，把眼泪变成坚决的誓言：“强盗们，你们毁吧，你们毁了我的房子，却毁不了我顽强的意志，我将永远按照我自己的愿望安排我的生活，而决不是按照你的！”就这样，在那荒漠的废墟上，又出现了一座座用断瓦残砖搭起来的小房。有一天，我们站在新义州文化宫残破的屋顶上，曾经看见下面好多妇女儿童正在一片瓦砾堆中辛勤愉快地建筑着
    一座美丽的花园，敌机在头上嗡嗡盘旋，她们傲然而视，似乎在说：“强盗们看吧，被你毁了我们的美丽的生活，我们一定再把她重建起来！”
    然而，朝鲜妇女真的不流眼泪吗？不，她们流的。当中国人民志愿军浩浩荡荡渡过鸭绿江时，她们流泪了；当中国人民志愿军抛头颅、洒热血解放了她们的乡土时，她们流泪了；当中国人民志愿军奋不顾身抢救她们的生命财产时，她们流泪了；当中国人民志愿军帮助她们生产、节约粮食救济她们的灾荒时，她们流泪了；当各兄弟国家给她们以无私的援助时，她们流泪了；……她们的眼泪，只有在热情汹涌、感激爱戴时才任它洒流的。有多少次，在她们亲热的拥抱中，我们友谊的泪流在一起而湿透了衣襟！
    她们的性格是：既柔且刚；她们的感情是：爱憎分明。她们懂得如何去爱她们的朋友；更知道怎样去恨她们的敌人。在朝鲜战场上，不但产生了很多志愿军爱民故事；也流传着不少人民热爱志愿军的佳话，下面就是个最平常的例子——
    一个寒风刺骨的早晨，在志愿军某重伤医院的洞子外边，徘徊着一个七十多岁的朝鲜老大娘，她挎着一篮子新蒸的馍馍，焦急地等待着会见她的亲人。她告诉护士说，她昨天晚上才听到张万厚负伤转来的消息，便连夜磨了留做种籽的麦子蒸了这一篮子馍馍。她一再要求：
    “不让我见到人，这馍馍总得替他留下呀！”
    “不是不让你见，赵大娘。”护士们都亲热地称呼着她，因为大家都熟识她；她就是不久以前才从这里养好伤出院的赵德实老太太。“他的伤很重。在危险期中，任何人都不准接见的；至于这馍馍，你想他又怎么能够吃呢？”
    赵大娘听说她的亲人生命危险，脸色立刻苍白了，她不安地徘徊了半天，才失望地挎着篮子离去。
    就从那天起，赵大娘每天都要来一次。她在那冰冻的山路上，迎着严寒的北风一跌一滑地走着，而每天都是带着失望和不安回去。
        一个礼拜过去了，她已经显得更衰老了，而张万厚终于脱离了危险期，医院终于允许接见老大娘了。她三步并成一步地冲进病房，一下子就扑到张万厚的床边。张万厚看见挎着馍馍、脚步蹒跚的赵大娘时，竟忘记了伤痛，感动得什么也忘了问，只紧紧搂着她的脖子叫道：“你真是我最好最好的朝鲜母亲！”赵大娘颤抖着声音说：“你才是我最好最好的中国儿子呢。”这时，她清楚地记起，“敌人在撤退前如何把她毒打了，而后和很多同胞一齐被活埋了。当志愿军赶来营救时，她已经是气息奄奄，四肢都被压伤了。战士张万厚把她抢救出来，立即不顾疲劳地背她到这个医院里，随后便去追赶队伍。想不到竟是这样巧……”老大娘想到这里，不由得把张万厚拥抱得更紧，喃喃重复道：
        “你才是我最好最好的中国儿子呢，最好的……”
    善良的朝鲜妇女，是以女性的温存和母亲的慈爱去热爱自己的军队和朋友的，同时却用勇敢坚决的行动去对付她们的敌人，黄海道遂原郡面女盟委员长李少女的行动，就是个具体例子——
    在前年军队后退期间，李少女没有随军撤退。一天，十七个敌军来到她隐蔽的地方，命令她给做饭吃，她推说去借米，便乘机派人通知了游击队。但为了拖延时间，她借来的不是米而是稻子，于是她便坐在院子里故作忙碌地推呀磨呀。但是，饭做好了，还不见游击队的影子。她始终相信游击队一定会来的，怎样再拖延几分钟呢？眼看敌人们快吃完饭了。她急中生智地走进厨房去，把墙上的一串干辣椒拿了下来，很敏捷地便磨成了粉末。她得意地想：“捉不到你们也让你们吃点辣的”。当她走进屋时，敌人们正在狼吞虎咽地大吃大嚼着，她咬了咬嘴唇，用迅雷不及掩耳的动作把一大碗鲜红的辣椒面像播种似地向敌人们的脸上撒去，于是，三十四只杀人杀红了的眼睛再也睁不开了。正在他们狼狈挣扎时，游击队赶来了，十七个敌人一个也没有能够逃脱。
    除此之外，更有无数的朝鲜女英雄、女劳动者，为了保全民族气节，为了严守机密，甚至为了抗拒野兽的凌辱，竟咬紧牙关忍受着自己的丈夫惨遭杀戮、眼看着自己的儿女被挑死在敌人的刀尖上，而最后自己也成为无畏的烈士。上千上万的悲壮事迹，是用血写成的一部伟大史诗。
    自从战争爆发以来，凡是没被杀害的青壮男子，都英勇地走上了前线。留下来的，除了老弱残废，绝大部分是勤劳的妇女，因此，她们便成为后方生产的主要劳动力。她们不顾敌机轰炸和既无种籽又缺畜力和农具的困难勇敢地提出了“用我们的力量保证生产”的口号。就这样，在军队和政府人力物力帮助之下，她们提前十五天完成了一九五一年的春耕任务，超额完成计划百分之一○二。要不是洪水为灾，去年的收成会是很丰盛的。
    界川郡劳动英雄金洛熙，是一个身体不大健康的十九岁的女孩子，没有一点生产经验；可是当她的父亲被敌人惨杀后，她决心要为“向前线多送一粒米”而斗争。结果，不但完成了自己刨地四、○○○坪的全部计划，还帮助无劳力户刨了一五、○○○坪地，铡了马草六○吨。比父亲生前增产水稻二九麻袋，终于实现了向金日成将军献出爱国米的心愿。
    在工业生产战线上，同样也出现了不少女劳动英雄。但，不要忘了，她们是在怎样狂轰滥炸的威胁下，坚持着她们的生产的。在朝鲜的国营纺织厂，我们荣幸地会见了屡次获奖、曾出席国际纺织会议的缫丝英雄唐云实。她不过是个刚满二十岁的姑娘，却成了全国知名的英雄。在和平时期，她的生产量是百分之四○○；战争爆发后，她加紧努力的结果，又使她的生产量超过和平时期生产量的百分之五○。她的生产力是这样地惊人，可是当她向我们报告她的生产成绩时，却是那样的朴素谦虚。她去年春天到过中国，她说：“中国的抗美援朝运动给我的教育和感动太深了，郝建秀同志的事迹给我的帮助和鼓舞太大了。”
    朝鲜妇女不但是生产战线上的英雄，同时也是保证运输、支援前线不可少的动力。当你坐着车子，飞驶在坦平的公路上时，你就不能不感激她们的一份劳绩。在那修浮桥、铺泥路的民工行列中，你可以经常看到她们活动的影子，她们舞动着最原始的工具，一锹一锹地铲着沙石，两只脚插在污泥里，泥浆溅满了洁白的衣襟。那愉快的欢笑和不疲倦的歌声，会使你感到她们是无忧无虑，然而，也许当她们劳动归去后，家中还没有下锅的米，甚至连一件换洗的衣服和一双多余的鞋子都没有啊。
    经常有这样的情况：你前一天曾经陷过车子的路，到第二天再从原路返回时，路已经修得像柏油马路一样平滑。而那些修路的妇女们，当你的车子经过她们的身边时，她们便会向你招手欢呼，仿佛在显示着她们劳动的胜利，并祝你一路平安。
    在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的前沿阵地上，女医务人员、女文工团员自然是常来常往，而劳动妇女的足迹也是经常出现的。在战斗激烈、供应困难的时期，妇女们为了保证战争的胜利，竟不避艰险地，冒着敌机扫射，穿越层层火网，从五六十里以外的后方，顶着上百斤的弹药送上火线，下去的时候，便把伤员背回后方。在战争最艰苦的日子里，前沿的战士常常两三天吃不上饭，敌占区的妇女们是不肯让保卫国土的勇士们挨饿的，她们宁愿自己不吃、不睡，也募集粮食，连夜挑水磨面，偷偷制成一袋袋的“打糕”，再偷偷地送上阵地。然而，穿过敌人的炮火是会有牺牲的，她们唯恐干粮送不到勇士们的口里，便有计划地组织起来，送一麻袋“打糕”，就要去五六个妇女，她们拉成一个保有相当距离的行列，小心地前进。假如前边的一个倒下去了，后边的人马上扛过袋子，踏着那新鲜的血迹，勇敢地冲向前去。
    在英勇战斗着的朝鲜半岛上，像这样可歌可泣的事迹，是到处都在传诵着的。妇女英雄和民族烈士每天都在涌现着。妇女们已经成长为一支不可战胜的抗击侵略的力量。可惜我的记录不在手边，仅凭片段的记忆，是不足以描绘她们的勇敢于万一的。
    勤劳勇敢的朝鲜姊妹们，的确无愧于“英雄”的称号。她们的优美品质，是没法不叫人敬爱的。虽然我的歌颂远不如事实那样激动人心，但我还是要歌颂她们。因为，我永远要歌颂我所敬爱的。
    亲爱的朝鲜英雄妇女们，我谨以一个姊妹和战友的身份，向你们致以最亲切的慰问和最崇高的敬礼！亲爱的姊妹们，更勇敢地战斗吧，你们的斗争永远不是孤立的。
