Editor's Note: The method of mobilizing the masses to control pests using "comparative visits" in the suburbs of Tianshui City is very good. Currently, insect pests such as cotton aphids and locusts are still breeding and developing. Therefore, this experience is of great value for promotion.

    In April of this year, more than 17,200 mu of wheat fields in twelve villages in the suburbs of Tianshui City, Gansu Province, suffered from severe insect damage. Among them, the 522 mu of wheat fields that were most severely affected had their seedlings completely eaten by insects.

    Based on this situation, the local people's government immediately suspended all work that could be postponed and determined that eliminating insect pests was the overriding central task at present. Subsequently, all villages convened cadre meetings to study pest control measures and established pest eradication guidance committees. However, when starting to mobilize for pest control, many erroneous ideas were found among the masses. In areas with severe insect damage, most of the masses held a pessimistic and disappointed attitude, believing that "there is no way" and "it is over"; in areas where insect damage was not yet severe, many masses had a paralyzing mentality, saying, "It doesn't matter, it will be fine in a few days"; in areas where insect damage had not yet spread, many masses had a sense of complacency, thinking, "We won't have insects here." When the insect damage first occurred, some wheat seedlings were eaten by insects, and some people even thought they had been frozen to death. As the insect damage spread day by day, many people became pessimistic and anxious, saying, "Planting is up to man, harvesting is up to heaven," "Pests are divine insects," and "Insects eating wheat is the will of heaven." Some of these people even secretly slaughtered chickens and pigs behind the backs of the cadres, worshipping Buddha and praying to gods, hoping that the "gods" would quickly take these "divine insects" back.

    The problem was very clear: to carry out pest control work, it was necessary to first eliminate these ideological obstacles of the masses. The leadership departments in this area then launched a series of publicity and mobilization efforts. In the publicity and mobilization work, the most effective method was to mobilize the masses to conduct "comparative visits." This method involved organizing the masses to visit wheat fields that had been treated for pests and those that had not been treated for pests to see the difference. For example, the masses saw that the wheat seedlings in the Shi Ming mutual aid team that had been treated with cotton oil and soapy water changed from yellow to green, while the wheat seedlings of farmer Zhao Zhong that had not been treated changed from slightly yellow to withered yellow; they saw that the wheat seedlings of farmer Qin Shengsheng had as many as 38 wheat aphids on one wheat leaf before treatment, but after treatment, there were only two at most. Combining the wheat field visits, the cadres also brought over 90,000 captured pests from the wheat fields as specimens for exhibition, so that everyone could recognize the seriousness of the damage caused by these pests to the wheat fields and the benefits of pest control. After conducting publicity and education to the masses through "comparative visits," the masses' paralyzing mentality and reliance on heaven for food were gradually overcome, and their confidence in pest control was also improved.

    After the ideological obstacles to pest eradication were eliminated, the pest control movement in this area quickly unfolded. Each village organized more than 6,000 "pest eradication combat teams" based on mutual aid teams. During the movement, the masses came up with more than 100 ways to eradicate insect pests. Within seven days, they eliminated wheat aphids and red spiders infesting more than 16,600 mu of wheat fields and captured more than 3 million underground pests such as mole crickets and cutworms. A total of twelve villages emerged with more than sixty model pest eradication mutual aid teams and one hundred and ninety model pest eradicators.

    After this pest control effort, each village has now organized long-term pest reconnaissance teams to constantly monitor the occurrence of pests. This has laid a good foundation for long-term pest control work in this area.

### 甘肃天水市郊区  用“对比参观”方法发动群众扑灭虫害

    甘肃天水市郊区
    用“对比参观”方法发动群众扑灭虫害
    编者按：天水市郊区用“对比参观”发动
    群众治虫的方法很好。目前棉蚜、蝗虫等虫害
    仍在滋生和发展，因此，这个经验很有推广的
    价值。
    今年四月，甘肃天水市郊区十二个乡有一万七千二百多亩麦田发生了严重的虫害，其中五百二十二亩受害最重的麦田，麦苗都已被虫咬死。
    当地人民政府根据这一情况，就立刻停止了一切可以暂缓进行的工作，确定以消灭虫害为当前压倒一切的中心任务。接着各乡都召开了干部会，研究了治虫办法，建立了灭虫指导委员会。但是在开始发动治虫时，在群众中间却发现了许多错误思想。在虫害严重的地区，大部分群众都抱着一种悲观失望的态度，他们认为“没办法”，“已经完了”；在虫害还不严重的地区，许多群众都有麻痹思想，他们说：“不要紧，过几天就没事了”；在虫害还没有蔓延的地区，许多群众都有太平观念，他们认为“我们这里不会发生虫子”。在虫害刚发生时，有些麦苗被虫咬死了，有的人还认为是冻死的。虫害一天天蔓延，许多人就悲观着急，他们说：“种在人，收在天”，“害虫是神虫”，“虫吃麦子是天意”。这些人有的还背着干部杀鸡宰猪，拜佛求神，希望“神”赶快把这些“神虫”收回去。
    问题很明显，要想开展治虫工作，就必须先消除群众这些思想障碍。这个地区的领导部门于是展开了一系列的宣传动员工作。在宣传动员工作中，收效最大的一个办法就是发动群众，进行“对比参观”。这个办法是组织群众参观治过虫的麦田和没有治过虫的麦田有什么不同。例如群众看见师铭互助组用棉油皂水喷射治虫后的麦苗由黄转绿，农民赵忠没有除治的麦苗由微黄变成枯黄；看见农民秦生生的麦苗，在除治前一个麦叶上最多的有三十八个麦蚜虫，经过除治后最多的只有两个。结合麦田参观，干部们还把从麦田捕捉的九万多个害虫，拿来当作标本展览，让大家认识这些害虫对麦田危害的严重性和治虫的好处。经过“对比参观”向群众进行宣传教育后，群众的麻痹思想和靠天吃饭思想，就逐渐被克服，治虫的信心也就提高了。
    除治虫害的思想障碍被排除以后，这个地区的治虫运动很快就开展起来了。各乡以互助组为基础组织了六千多个“灭虫战斗队”。在运动中群众想出了一百多种除治虫害的办法。在七天内消灭了盘踞在一万六千六百多亩麦田中的麦蚜虫和红蜘蛛，捕捉了三百多万只地老虎、蝼蛄等地下虫害。十二个乡共涌现出了六十多个灭虫模范互助组，一百九十个灭虫模范。
    经过这次治虫后，现在每个村都组织了长期的虫害侦察小组，经常监视虫害的发生。这都给这个地区长期灭虫工作打下良好的基础。
