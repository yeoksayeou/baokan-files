    马来亚民族解放军广泛出击
    【新华社十七日讯】新加坡消息：在马来亚柔佛、彭亨、霹雳和雪兰莪等州的马来亚民族解放军部队，继续给英国殖民军以新的打击。
    据英国殖民政府发表的公报承认：五月二十六日，民族解放军在柔佛州古莱区，击毙了一名欧洲籍英国殖民警官和二名殖民警察；六月二日，英国殖民警察十四人在霹雳州怡保附近，受到民族解放军约六十人的伏击，结果八名殖民警察被击毙；六月三日，民族解放军在彭亨州关丹区攻击二辆英国殖民警察车辆，结果击伤二名殖民警察，同一天，民族解放军在霹雳州北部击毙了一个英国殖民军少校麦克唐纳；六月六日，民族解放军在雪兰莪州万挠击毙英“皇家空军”第九十一中队斯泰丁空军中尉；六月八日，民族解放军在彭亨州的两个地区和柔佛州的古莱，一天中先后共出击三次，击伤英殖民警官多人。
    马来亚民族解放军广泛的攻击，已使越来越多的英国殖民警察不愿充当英帝国主义的炮灰。据合众社新加坡六月三日电透露：六月三日，有四十七个英国殖民警察，因拒绝执行“丛林巡逻的勤务”，举行静坐罢工而被革职。
