Wang Congwu's Report at the Meeting on Handling the Zhang Shunyou Incident (Abstract)

To report the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude, Zhang Shunyou traveled back and forth between several organizations in the three provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan from June to October last year. Later, to recover wages and compensate for travel expenses, and to accuse bureaucratic elements and saboteurs who hindered the reporting, he traveled to many organizations from November last year to March this year. In total, he ran to 27 organizations, traveled 15,000 miles, and spent 2.4 million yuan. Among the 27 organizations that Zhang Shunyou visited, he ran to one organization 20 times. A total of 42 cadres, from the Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Government and the Director of the Provincial Public Security Department to trainee staff, directly or indirectly handled this issue. Of the above-mentioned organizations and staff, except for the Taiping Street Police Station in Guisui City, the Fourth District People's Government of Yanggao County in Chahar, the village cadre Song Zengai of Dongshuidi Village in the Fourth District, the People's Government of Guoxian County in Shanxi Province, the County Federation of Trade Unions, and the Second District People's Government, which adopted a more serious and responsible attitude towards this issue, the rest either took responsibility for resolving it but did not persevere to the end; some organizations, such as the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau, the Datong County People's Government, and the Second District People's Government of Guisui City, refused to accept the case under the pretext of "insufficient materials, incomplete procedures" or "suppressing counter-revolutionaries is the business of the Public Security Bureau" and "wage issues are civil disputes"; Comrade Wei Fengqi, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand because Zhang Shunyou's request "did not comply with the regulations"; Zhao Zhenfang, a trainee staff member of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau, even hinted that the bailiff should handcuff the reporter; Wu Xiang, a warden of the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau Detention Center, detained the reporter and the counter-revolutionary element together for two hours without looking at the introduction letter; Wang Shenwu, an intern staff member of the Guisui City People's Court, threatened the reporter under the pretext that "you will be responsible if the materials are wrong." Their arrogance towards the people is truly intolerable.

What are the lessons of this incident? What does it illustrate? This incident first illustrates that the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses seriously exists among many of our leading cadres and staff (including many Communist Party members). These comrades do not follow Chairman Mao's instructions to be "friends of the people," but regard themselves as the "superiors" and "masters" of the people, not caring about the suffering of the masses, and not listening to the voices of the masses. They shout "serve the people" every day, but in reality, they push the problems that the people urgently need to solve back and forth without solving them. They even fail to support matters such as the masses reporting counter-revolutionary elements, but instead obstruct and attack them. Their class stance is very blurred, and their hatred of counter-revolutionaries is not even as strong as that of ordinary people. Some organizations and cadres have an incorrect attitude of targeting individuals rather than addressing the issue when handling cases of complaints from the masses. For example, some people emphasize that "Zhang Shunyou has a bad history," "Zhang Shunyou's reporting of counter-revolutionary elements is based on personal interests," and "the motives are impure," and conclude that "both sides are bad." Zhang Shunyou did have mistakes in his history, and Zhang Shunyou's struggle with Song Yude was indeed related to his own interests; but can we therefore say that Zhang Shunyou is not reporting counter-revolutionary elements? Does this change the nature of the matter? Are only people with no mistakes in their history or Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members qualified to report counter-revolutionary elements, while Zhang Shunyou is not qualified? On the contrary, Zhang Shunyou's reporting of counter-revolutionary elements is completely correct and completely in line with the interests of the Party and the people, and is therefore worthy of our welcome and support. Failure to do so is a bureaucratic error. In this "Three-Anti" movement, the opposition to corruption and waste has been carried out most thoroughly and deeply; the bureaucracy associated with corruption and waste has also been hit to a certain extent, but the kind of bureaucracy exposed in Zhang Shunyou's complaint case, which directly undermines the connection between the Party and the People's Government and the people, and directly hinders the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, has not been thoroughly exposed. Some have been exposed, but the problems have not been resolved in a timely manner or have not been resolved at all. Therefore, all organs and groups should seize the current opportunity for democratic make-up lessons without exception, and universally and conscientiously carry out an inspection against bureaucratic work styles to consolidate and expand the achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement.

This incident also exposes many serious shortcomings and errors in our many Party, government, and people's organizations in handling letters from the masses, treating criticisms and suggestions from the masses, and accepting reports and accusations from the masses. We have special institutions and organizations and designated personnel such as people's opinion boxes, supervisory correspondents, reader's letter groups, propagandists, and inquiry offices to listen to the opinions of the people and solve the problems of the people, but due to the lack of sound working systems and inspection systems, these organizations cannot play their due role. For example, Huo Chengxun, the editor of the reader's letter group of Shanxi Daily, detained Zhang Shunyou's complaint letter, neither publishing it nor transferring it to the relevant departments for processing; Wang Shude, the secretary of the Suiyuan Provincial Procuratorate, also arbitrarily detained Zhang Shunyou's complaint letter after taking it out of the opinion box without transferring it. The reason why they dared to do this is mainly because there is no or a lack of sound working systems and inspection systems, and no work discipline and policy education. For example, Li Hengwen, the deputy director of the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau, was completely unaware of the situation that the cadres of the bureau had wrongly detained Zhang Shunyou and detained the special investigation materials of Zhang Shunyou's reporting of Song Yude, and after he knew about it, he neither reported it to the higher authorities nor seriously inspected and handled it. Zhang Shunyou went to the Yanbei Prefectural Public Security Office three times to report counter-revolutionary elements, but Zhang Xu, a member of the interrogation section of the office, neither reported to the higher authorities nor seriously handled it, and arbitrarily dismissed the matter. This makes the work chaotic, the state law relaxed, and the political enthusiasm of the masses dampened.

How should we overcome bureaucratic work styles in the future?

First, the leading organs at all levels in all regions should learn from the Zhang Shunyou incident, earnestly promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, thoroughly examine the attitude and handling of complaints, reports, criticisms, suggestions, and requests from the people by this department and unit; and combine it with the inspection of personal ideology, work style, and attitude; finally, make a summary and propose improvement measures to improve work and educate cadres.

Second, we must implement mass supervision from the bottom up and strengthen inspection from the top down; strictly convene people's representative conferences and people's congresses of all walks of life regularly in accordance with democratic principles, report work to the people, and listen to the opinions of the masses. Establish and improve organizations for receiving and contacting the masses (such as people's inquiry offices, etc.), and give full play to the role of the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the People's Government Supervision Committee. The leading organs at all levels and departments should take the inspection and overcoming of bureaucratic work styles on the leadership side as a regular and important task. The Party and League organizations should mobilize and organize Party members and League members to play an active role in the struggle against bureaucracy.

Third, the main responsible cadres and all staff members of all levels and departments should take various methods to strengthen contact with the broad masses, pay close attention to listening to the voices and reflections of the masses, and make accurate reports to the leadership. To this end, all organs and groups should stipulate strict working systems, clearly stipulate the duties and powers of each person, and overcome chaos. All suggestions, requests, complaints, and reports from the people and the broad masses of cadres that they can handle must be handled conscientiously and responsibly; those that they cannot handle should be reported to the higher authorities promptly. It is necessary to answer all questions and have results for every case. The main responsible comrades should personally take responsibility, regularly organize all staff members to conduct inspections and summaries, give responsible explanations to the people, and make practical reports to the leading organs.

Fourth, strictly enforce the discipline of the Party and the People's Government, promptly criticize and punish those cadres who are derelict in their duties; encourage and commend those outstanding cadres who maintain close ties with the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly; and make full use of newspapers and Party publications to expose the factual errors of bureaucracy, establish role models for maintaining close ties with the masses, and mobilize Party members and the masses to fight against bureaucratic work styles.

Fifth, in the struggle against bureaucracy, we must promptly address the ideological situation of cadres, seize vivid typical examples, and constantly conduct Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought education for Party members and cadres, in order to continuously improve the awareness of cadres and strengthen their view of serving the people wholeheartedly.

In order to uphold Party and government discipline and educate all Party members and cadres, the North China Bureau fully agrees with and approves the relevant provincial party committees' measures for this case and the handling opinions for relevant cadres. (1) Li Hengwen, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of Yanggao County, Chahar, was seriously derelict in his duties for the serious mistakes of his subordinates in refusing to accept Zhang Shunyou's report of counter-revolutionary elements and wrongly detaining Zhang Shunyou. It is agreed that he should be given a public warning within the Party, and it is recommended that the government give him an administrative punishment. (2) Wu Xiang, a warden of the Detention Center of the Public Security Bureau of Yanggao County, Chahar, seriously violated his duties and violated human rights by putting Zhang Shunyou and the counter-revolutionary elements into the prison together without looking at the introduction letter. It is recommended that the government give him the punishment he deserves. (3) Wang Tingshi, a member of the Execution Section of the Public Security Bureau of Yanggao County, Chahar, accepted Zhang Shunyou's complaint and promised to write a letter to the Guisui City Public Security Bureau asking them to handle it; but after Zhang Shunyou left, he put it aside and suppressed the materials specially investigated by Zhang Shunyou, neither reporting to the leadership nor handling it, which is a serious act of irresponsibility and lack of organization and discipline. It is agreed that he should be given a public warning within the Party, and it is recommended that the government give him an administrative punishment. (4) Zhang Xu, a member of the interrogation section of the Political Security Section of the Yanbei Prefectural Public Security Office of Chahar, pushed Zhang Shunyou to other organs under the pretext that Zhang Shunyou did not have an introduction letter, causing Zhang Shunyou to make three fruitless trips. He neither checked the results of the handling nor reported to the leadership, showing a serious lack of work responsibility and lack of organization and discipline. It is agreed that he should be given a public warning within the Party, and it is recommended that the government give him an administrative punishment. (5) Zhao Zhenfang, a trainee cadre of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau, hinted that the bailiff should handcuff Zhang Shunyou, which is a serious act of violating laws and discipline and infringing on human rights. It is recommended that the government give him the punishment he deserves. (6) Yu Weikun, the director of the Xiaoxijie Police Station in Guisui City, refused to accept Zhang Shunyou's report, which is a serious dereliction of duty. It is recommended that the government give him the punishment he deserves. (7) Wei Fengqi, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, when other comrades reported to him Zhang Shunyou's intentions and requirements and asked him for instructions on how to handle them, did not clarify the entire situation of Zhang Shunyou's reporting of counter-revolutionary elements, and dismissed the matter because Zhang Shunyou's request "did not comply with the regulations"; when the reporter explained to him that "if it is not resolved, people will go to the Central Government to find Chairman Mao to resolve it," Wei said: "This cannot be resolved, let him go!" This shows a serious lack of responsibility and a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the suffering of the people. It is agreed that he should be given a public warning within the Party, and it is recommended that the government give him an administrative punishment.

In the entire process of Zhang Shunyou's reporting of counter-revolutionary elements, there were also a few organs and cadres who treated this issue with a responsible attitude. For example, the Taiping Street Police Station in Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, the County Federation of Trade Unions, the County People's Government, and the Second District People's Government in Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, the Fourth District People's Government in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, and the village cadre Song Zengai of Dongshuidi Village in the Fourth District of Yanggao County actively tried to provide Zhang Shunyou with support and encouragement, and helped solve the problem of travel expenses when Zhang Shunyou was in difficulty. With their support and help, the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude was finally arrested and brought to justice. The above-mentioned organs and individuals should be commended.

    王从吾同志在处理张顺有事件会议上的报告（摘要）
    张顺有为了检举反革命分子宋郁德，在去年六月至十月往返奔跑了山西、察哈尔、绥远三个省的好些机关。以后为了追偿工资、补偿路费，控诉阻难检举的官僚主义分子和破坏分子，又从去年十一月到今年三月，来往奔跑了许多机关。前后共奔跑了二十七个机关，行程一万五千里，花费二百四十万元。在张顺有前后所到过的二十七个机关中，有一个机关他跑过二十次。直接或间接处理此问题的干部共四十二人，上至省人民政府秘书长、省公安厅处长，下至见习工作员。上述机关和工作人员，除归绥市太平街派出所、察哈尔阳高县第四区人民政府、四区东水地村村干部宋增爱、山西省崞县人民政府、县工会及第二区人民政府等对此问题采取了较为认真负责的态度以外，其余有的是虽曾负责解决，但未坚持到底；有的机关，如阳高县公安局、大同县人民政府和归绥市第二区人民政府等机关，则以“材料不足，手续不合”或“镇压反革命是公安局的事”、“工资问题是民事纠纷”等等为藉口而拒不受理；山西省人民政府秘书长卫逢祺同志则以张顺有的要求“不合制度规定”而一推了事；归绥市公安局见习工作员赵振芳甚至暗示法警给检举者带手铐；阳高县公安局看守所干事武祥不看介绍信就把检举者和反革命分子一并扣押两个钟头；归绥市人民法院实习工作员王申午则以“材料错了你得负责任”为口实，威吓检举者。其对人民群众态度之蛮横，实已令人不能容忍。
    这一事件的教训是什么呢？它说明一些什么问题呢？这一事件首先说明：脱离群众的官僚主义作风，在我们许多领导干部和工作人员（包括许多共产党员）中间都严重地存在着。这些同志不是遵照毛主席所指示我们的，做“民众的朋友”，而是以民众的“上司”和“老爷”自居，不关心群众的疾苦，不倾听群众的呼声。他们天天喊着“为人民服务”，实际却把人民群众迫切需要解决的问题推来推去，不予解决。甚至像群众检举反革命分子这样的事情，也不予支持，反而横加阻难和打击。他们的阶级立场非常模糊，对反革命的仇恨还不如一个普通的群众。有些机关和干部在受理群众控诉案件时，存在着对人不对事的错误态度。比如有些人强调“张顺有历史不好”、“张顺有检举反命革分子是从个人利益出发”、“动机不纯”，就得出“双方都坏”的结论。张顺有历史上确曾有过错误，张顺有所以和宋郁德斗争，也确实和他本人的利害有关；但是否因此就可以说张顺有不是在检举反革命分子呢？是否因此就改变了这件事情的性质呢？是否只有历史上没有错误的人或共产党员、青年团员才有资格检举反革命分子，而张顺有就没有资格呢？恰恰相反，张顺有检举反革命分子是完全正确的，是完全符合党和人民的利益的，因而也是值得我们欢迎和支持的。不这样做，就犯了官僚主义的错误。这次“三反”运动，以反对贪污、反对浪费进行得最为深入、彻底；和贪污、浪费有联系的官僚主义也受到一定程度的打击，但对于像张顺有控诉案所暴露出来的这种直接破坏着党和人民政府与人民群众联系、直接阻碍人民群众革命积极性的官僚主义，则还没有被彻底地揭发出来。有的虽已被揭发，但问题未能及时解决或根本未予解决。因此，各机关、团体都应毫无例外地抓紧目前民主补课的时机，普遍地认真地开展一次反对官僚主义作风的检查，以巩固和扩大“三反”运动的成果。
    这一事件还暴露出我们许多党、政机关和人民团体在处理群众来信、对待群众的批评和建议、受理群众的检举控告等等方面，存在着许多严重的缺点和错误。我们有了人民意见箱、监察通讯员、读者来信小组、宣传员、问事处等等专门听取人民意见、解决人民问题的机构和组织以及专设的人员，但由于缺乏健全的工作制度和检查制度，致使这些组织还不能起到应有的作用。譬如山西日报读者来信组编辑霍成勋，把张顺有的控告书扣押起来，既未发表，也未转有关部门处理；绥远省检察署秘书王树德把张顺有的控告书从意见箱中取出后，也擅自扣押不转。他们所以敢这样做，主要是由于根本没有或缺乏健全的工作制度、检查制度，没有工作纪律和政策教育。如阳高县公安局副局长李恒文对于该局干事错押张顺有和将张顺有检举宋郁德的专门调查材料扣押不转等情形，事前毫无所闻，事后知道了，既不报告上级，也不认真检查处理。张顺有为检举反革命分子三上雁北专署公安办事处，但该处审讯股员张绪既不报告上级，也不认真处理，竟擅自一推了事。这就使得工作陷于混乱，国家法律陷于松弛，群众的政治热情受到打击。
    今后我们应该如何克服官僚主义作风呢？
    第一、各地各级领导机关，应接受张顺有事件的教训，认真地发扬民主，展开批评和自我批评，彻底检查本部门、本单位对人民群众的控诉、检举、批评、建议和要求的态度和处理情况；并联系检查个人的思想作风和工作态度；最后作出总结，提出改进办法，以求改进工作，教育干部。
    第二、要实行自下而上的群众监督，加强自上而下的检查；严格按照民主原则定期召开各界人民代表会议和人民代表大会，向人民群众报告工作，听取群众意见。建立和健全接见和联系群众的组织（如人民问事处等），充分发挥党的纪律检查委员会、人民政府监察委员会的作用。各级各部门领导机关，都应把检查和克服领导方面的官僚主义作风作为经常的重要工作。党、团组织更应发动和组织党、团员在反对官僚主义的斗争中起积极的推动作用。
    第三、各级各部门的主要负责干部和一切工作人员，都应采取各种方法加强和广大群众的联系，十分注意倾听群众的呼声和反映，并向领导方面作确切的报告。为此，各机关、各团体都应规定严格的工作制度，明确规定每个人的职责权限，克服混乱现象。对人民群众和广大干部所提的一切建议、要求、控诉、检举，自己能够处理的，必须认真负责地处理；自己不能处理的，应迅速及时地向上级请示。必须作到有问必答，件件有结果。主要负责同志并应亲自负责，定期组织全体工作人员进行检查总结，向人民群众作负责的交代，向领导机关作切实的报告。
    第四、严明党和人民政府的纪律，及时批评和惩处那些渎职失职的干部；鼓励和表扬那些密切联系群众、全心全意为人民服务的优秀干部；并充分利用报纸、党刊，揭发官僚主义的错误事实，树立密切联系群众的榜样，发动党员、群众向官僚主义作风进行斗争。
    第五、在反对官僚主义斗争中，必须及时针对干部的思想情况，抓住生动的典型事例，经常地对党员、干部进行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育，以不断地提高干部的觉悟，加强他们全心全意为人民服务的观点。
    为了严肃政纪党纪，并教育全体党员和干部，华北局完全同意并批准有关省委对此案的措施及对有关干部的处理意见。（一）察哈尔阳高县公安局副局长李恒文，对所属干部拒绝受理张顺有检举反革命分子及错扣张顺有的严重错误，事前既无所闻，事后又不予适当处理和报告上级，这是一种严重的官僚主义失职行为，同意党内给以当众劝告处分，并建议政府给以行政处分。（二）察哈尔阳高县公安局看守所干事武祥，不看介绍信就把张顺有和反革命分子一并押进监所，这是玩忽职守、侵犯人权的严重错误，建议政府给以应得的处分。（三）察哈尔阳高县公安局执行股员王廷仕，接受了张顺有的控诉，并答应给归绥市公安局写信请其处理；但在张顺有走后，即搁置起来，并将张顺有专门调查来的材料压了下来，既没有向领导方面报告，也没有处理，这是严重的不负责任和无组织无纪律的行为。同意党内给以当众警告处分，并建议政府给以行政处分。（四）察哈尔雁北专署公安办事处政治保卫科审讯股员张绪，藉口张顺有没有介绍信，便将张顺有推到别的机关去，使张顺有三次徒劳往返。他自己既不检查处理结果，也没有向领导方面报告，表现了严重的缺乏工作责任心和无组织无纪律。同意党内予以当众劝告处分，并建议政府给以行政处分。（五）归绥市公安局见习干部赵振芳，暗示法警给张顺有带手铐，是严重的违法乱纪、侵犯人权的行为，建议政府给以应得的处分。（六）归绥市小西街派出所所长于维昆，拒不受理张顺有的检举，是严重的失职行为，建议政府给以应得的处分。（七）山西省人民政府秘书长卫逢祺，当其他同志向他报告了张顺有的来意和要求，并向他请示处理办法后，自己没有弄清张顺有检举反革命分子的整个情况，即以张顺有的要求“不合乎制度规定”而推走了事；当报告人向他说明“如果不给解决，人家就要到中央找毛主席去解决”时，卫说：“这无法解决，由他去吧！”表现了严重的不负责任和对待人民疾苦漠不关心的官僚主义态度。同意党内给以当众劝告处分，并建议政府给以行政处分。
    在张顺有检举反革命分子的整个过程中，也有少数机关和干部以负责的态度对待这一问题。如绥远省归绥市太平街派出所，山西省崞县县工会、县人民政府及第二区人民政府，察哈尔省阳高县第四区人民政府，阳高县第四区东水地村村干部宋增爱等，都积极设法予张顺有以支持和鼓励，并在张顺有困难时帮助解决路费问题。在他们的支持和帮助下，终于把反革命分子宋郁德逮捕法办，对以上机关和个人，应予以表扬。
