After this newspaper published the opinions of Comrade Dong Zhenyu and others on the rational use of specialized technical personnel on May 19, and published a "Brief Commentary" on this issue, it has aroused the attention of responsible cadres in many units; they have begun to investigate, register, and adjust cadre work, which is very good. However, to this day, many responsible cadres in units still do not recognize the great significance of the rational use of specialized technical personnel, and therefore have not taken active action. This situation must be changed quickly.

Our great motherland is about to begin large-scale economic construction; and large-scale economic construction must have a sufficient number of specialized technical personnel. Without a sufficient number of technical personnel, it will be impossible for our country to transform from an agricultural country into an industrial country. However, the current number of technical personnel in our country is far from meeting the needs of economic construction. In the short term, we certainly cannot train a large number of technical cadres from workers and peasants. More obviously, in the current situation where technical personnel are extremely scarce, some technical personnel and graduates from universities and colleges in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine are being irrationally used and wasted. Although the number of this part of specialized personnel being used irrationally is not large as a percentage of the total number of specialized technical personnel in the country, this phenomenon is universal from the perspective of various regions and departments.

The irrational use of specialized technical personnel is generally of three types. The first is assigning specialized technical personnel to non-specialized technical jobs. Some technical personnel are assigned to general administrative departments to do general administrative work; some are assigned to economic departments, but are still kept in the leading organs to do general administrative work; some are even assigned to factories and mines, but what they do is still non-specialized technical work. The second type is assigning personnel with specialized technical knowledge to jobs that can be handled by general personnel with ordinary technical knowledge. The third type is assigning personnel with one type of technical skill to another type of technical job. This not only fails to give play to the technical personnel's expertise, but also affects their work mood, which is extremely detrimental to our economic construction.

This irrational phenomenon was formed under certain historical conditions. First of all, it is one of the irrational phenomena left over from the Kuomintang rule. It was a general social phenomenon that technical personnel "learned one thing and used another" during the Kuomintang era. At that time, after technical personnel left school, the first thing they had to consider was the issue of food, not the issue of "consistency between learning and application." Many technical personnel were forced to abandon their specialized skills and do things that were completely unrelated to their skills. This phenomenon has persisted for a long time, causing many specialized technical personnel to leave their professions. Secondly, before the national liberation, the liberated areas lacked a modern industrial base, and other aspects of work urgently needed a large number of revolutionary cadres. At that time, we had to assign some specialized technical personnel to other positions. This was beneficial to the revolution at the time, and therefore appropriate. But why does this situation still exist universally today when the historical situation has completely changed? The most important reason is that some leading cadres in certain departments have a departmentalism that disregards the overall situation when it comes to the use of cadres. They are unwilling to send these technical personnel who "learned one thing and used another" to positions where they can best发挥 (give full play to) their expertise after the objective situation has changed.

Some leading cadres often one-sidedly emphasize "work needs," emphasizing that "as long as you have a certain level of education, you can do any job." Therefore, they insist on assigning students who graduated from science and engineering colleges to do general administrative work. They do not know how to cherish technical personnel. As early as 1935, Stalin sharply criticized this attitude of not valuing talent, pointing out: "If we want to successfully eliminate the phenomenon of extreme lack of talent and enable our country to obtain a sufficient number of cadres who can advance and apply technology, we must first learn to value talent..." ("Speech at the graduation ceremony of the Red Army Academy in the Kremlin"). In the "Three-Anti" movement, many cadres reviewed and criticized the mistake of wasting state wealth, which is very necessary. However, all leading cadres should understand that wasting talent is much more serious than wasting any wealth. Any phenomenon of not cherishing technical personnel and wasting technical personnel under the control of departmentalism is extremely harmful to the cause of national economic construction and cannot be tolerated.

"We are short of cadres here, 'since you're here, settle down', doing any job is serving the people!" Some leading cadres attempt to use this kind of specious reasoning to "convince" the cadres who are not using what they learned. Yes, all our work is to serve the people, but we must always consider the use of cadres based on the country's urgent needs. Today, we must first meet the needs of industrial construction, and not first meet the special needs of each unit. What reason is there to allow specialized technical personnel to do non-specialized technical work when the country urgently needs technical personnel? It is very clear that the saying "since you're here, settle down" is a completely irresponsible and erroneous argument, and we cannot allow specialized personnel to continue to be buried and wasted under this erroneous argument.

"We are keeping technical personnel in consideration of the needs of future work development." This is also a specious idea. Leading cadres with this kind of thinking often leave some technical cadres idle, waiting for so-called "future tasks"; while many industrial and mining departments are affected in design, construction, and production due to the lack of technical personnel. It is very clear that this kind of departmentalist view that does not proceed from reality, disregards the overall situation, and only seeks to satisfy the work interests of its own small unit is completely wrong.

"The work has been long, the business is familiar, if you transfer out, it will affect the work." This is another excuse. Although the transfer of cadres may cause temporary impact and difficulties on the work of certain units, these should indeed be paid attention to. However, if this is used as a reason to oppose the rational adjustment and use of technical personnel, this is putting the cart before the horse and is completely wrong. Because if we refuse to rationally adjust and use technical cadres, it will inevitably have a great impact and cause great difficulties on the cause of national construction. On this issue, "the part must obey the whole, and small interests must obey big interests" must become an unchangeable principle.

In order to rationally use specialized technical personnel, leading cadres of various departments and agencies in charge of cadre work should first earnestly understand the use of specialized technical personnel in their departments. If there are irrational phenomena, they should be determined to adjust them without any hesitation. Specialized technical personnel must be placed in the positions where economic construction needs them most, and in the basic construction and directly producing factories and mines. In addition to the cadres that the department really needs, adjustments should be made within the department based on the principle of consistency between learning and application and giving full play to the talents of cadres. All technical personnel who should not remain in the department must immediately report to the organizational and personnel departments of higher-level agencies for unified adjustment. Personnel with specialized technical knowledge, if they believe that their work assignment is unreasonable, can and should raise their opinions to the leadership; if necessary, they can raise their opinions at a higher level, all the way up to the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government. Leading cadres of this agency must not adopt any attitude of blame, obstruction, suppression, or attack. The organizational and personnel departments of leading agencies at all levels should carefully check the adjustment of technical cadres in various departments. Letters from specialized technical personnel regarding work issues must be handled responsibly and properly in order to conscientiously implement the policy of rationally using technical cadres.

### 把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去

    把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去
    本报在五月十九日发表了董振玉等同志关于合理使用专门技术人材的意见并发表了关于这个问题的“简评”之后，已引起了许多单位负责干部的重视；他们已开始进行调查、登记和调整干部的工作，这是很好的。但至今仍有不少单位的负责干部，还不认识合理使用专门技术人材的重大意义，因而还没有积极地行动起来。这种状况，必须迅速加以改变。
    我们伟大的祖国即将开始大规模的经济建设；而大规模的经济建设必须有足够数量的专门技术人材。没有足够数量的技术人材，就不可能使我们的国家由农业国变成为工业国。但是，目前我国技术人材的数量，远不能适应经济建设的需要。我们在短时期固然不能培养出大批由工农出身的技术干部，而更明显的是在目前十分缺乏技术人材的情况下，却又有一部分技术人员和高等学校的理、工、农、医各科毕业的学生，被不合理地使用着、浪费着。这一部分被不合理使用的专门人材的数量，占全国专门技术人材的总数虽然不大，但从各地区、各部门来看，这种现象则是带有普遍性的。
    使用专门技术人材不合理的现象，大体上有三种。第一种是分配专门技术人员去担任非专门技术的工作。有的技术人员被分配在一般行政部门中做一般的行政工作；有的虽然被分配到经济部门，但是仍然被留在领导机关中作一般的行政工作；有的即使被分配到工厂、矿山中，但是他所做的还是非专门技术的工作；第二种是分配具有专门技术知识的人员去担任一般的、有普通技术知识的人员即可担任的工作；第三种是分配具有这一门技术的人员去担任另一门的技术工作。这样，不但不能发挥技术人员的专长，而且影响了他们的工作情绪，这对我们的经济建设是十分不利的。
    这种不合理的现象，是在一定的历史条件下形成的。首先，它是国民党统治时期遗留下来的不合理的现象之一。技术人材“学非所用”，在国民党统治时代，是一般的社会现象。当时，技术人员离开学校以后，首先要考虑的是吃饭问题，而不是什么“学用一致”的问题。许多技术人员被迫把自己学得的专门技术荒废起来，而去作与自己的技术毫不相干的事情。这种现象相沿日久，就使许多专门技术人材脱离了本行。其次，在全国解放以前，解放区还缺乏现代工业基础，而其他方面的工作，又迫切需要大批的革命干部。当时，我们曾不得不把若干专门技术人材，分配到其他岗位上去工作。这在当时是对革命有利的，因此也是适当的。但是，为什么在历史情况已经完全改变了的今天，这种情况还依然普遍地存在着呢？其中最主要的原因，就在于某些部门的某些领导干部，在使用干部问题上，有一种不顾大局的本位主义思想。他们还不愿意在客观情况变化以后，把这些“学非所用”的技术人材，送到最能发挥他们的特长的岗位上去。
    某些领导干部往往片面地强调“工作需要”，强调“只要有一定的文化程度，什么工作都可以作。”因而他们硬把理、工学院毕业的学生分配去做一般的行政工作。他们不知珍惜技术人材。斯大林早在一九三五年就曾尖锐地批判过这种不重视人材的态度，指出：“我们如果想要顺利地消灭十分缺乏人材的现象，并使我国得到充分数量能够推进技术和运用技术的干部，首先就应当学会重视人材……。”
    （“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”）我们在“三反”运动中，有许多干部都检讨和批判了浪费国家财富的错误，这是非常必要的。但是，应该让所有的领导干部了解，浪费人材，比浪费任何财富都要严重得多。任何在本位主义思想支配下，不珍惜技术人材、浪费技术人材的现象，对国家经济建设事业都是极端有害的，都是不能容忍的。
    “我们这里缺少干部，‘既来之，则安之’，做什么工作都是为人民服务呀！”有些领导干部企图拿这种似是而非的道理来“说服”所学非所用的干部。是的，我们的一切工作都是为人民服务的，但是，我们随时都必须根据国家的迫切需要来考虑干部的使用问题。我们在今天必须首先满足工业建设的需要，而不能首先满足每一个单位的特殊需要。有什么理由在国家迫切需要技术人材的时候，让专门技术人员担任非专门技术的工作呢？十分明显，“既来之，则安之”的说法，完全是一种不负责任的错误的论调，我们不能容许在这种错误论调之下，继续埋没和浪费专门人材。
    “我们留住技术人员，是考虑到将来工作发展的需要”这也是似是而非的想法。有这种思想的领导干部，往往把一部分技术干部闲置起来，等待着所谓“未来的任务”；而许多工、矿部门却因为缺乏技术人材而影响了设计、施工和生产。非常明显，这种不从实际出发，不顾大局，只图满足自己小单位工作利益的本位主义观点，是完全错误的。
    “工作时间长了，业务熟悉了，如果调出去，就要影响工作。”这是另一种藉口。虽然，由于干部的调动，可能使某些单位的工作遭受暂时的影响，发生某些困难，这些的确应该加以注意。但是，如果以此为理由来反对合理地调整和使用技术人员，这就是本末倒置，完全错误的了。因为如果拒绝合理地调整和使用技术干部，势必使国家建设事业遭受极大的影响，发生极大的困难。在这个问题上，“局部服从整体，小利益服从大利益”必须成为不可更易的原则。
    为着合理地使用专门技术人材，各个部门的领导干部和掌管干部工作的机关，首先应该切实了解本部门专门技术人材的使用情况，如有不合理的现象，应决心加以调整，而不应有丝毫犹豫。必须把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去，放到基本建设和直接进行生产的工厂矿山中去。除本部门确实需要的干部，应该在学与用一致、充分发挥干部才能的原则下在本部门进行调整以外，凡是不应该留在本部门中的技术人材，都必须立即报告上级机关的组织部门和人事部门，加以统一调整。具有专门技术知识的人员，如果认为自己的工作分配不合理，可以而且应该向领导方面提出自己的意见；必要时可以越级提出意见，直到向中央人民政府人事部提出意见。本机关的领导干部对此不得采取任何责难、阻挠、压制、打击的态度。各级领导机关的组织部门和人事部门，应该认真检查各部门调整技术干部的情况。对于专门技术人员有关工作问题的来信，必须负责地加以妥善的处理，以便认真贯彻合理地使用技术干部的方针。
