    Suggestion for the Shenyang No. 8 Textile Factory to Improve the Yarn Changing Method of Wool Spinning Machines
    Editor: I visited the Shenyang No. 8 Textile Factory and saw that the workers of the wool spinning machine in this factory first took off the flyer, then took off the full yarn bobbin, and then put on the empty yarn tube and the flyer when changing the yarn. This method wastes a lot of time. When our factory's wool spinning machine workers change the yarn, they hold the flyer with the right hand and the empty yarn tube with the left hand; they use the empty yarn tube to push under the full yarn bobbin, and the full yarn bobbin goes up, the empty yarn tube is placed with the left hand, and the flyer is installed with the right hand. It is not necessary to take off the flyer and put it down again at all. I suggest that the leading cadres of Shenyang No. 8 Textile Factory mobilize the workers to test my factory's operation method on the wool spinning machine, maybe it can be promoted. If it cannot be promoted, please let me know the reason in a letter.

### 建议沈阳纺织八厂改进粗纺机换纱法

    建议沈阳纺织八厂改进粗纺机换纱法
    编辑同志：我曾到沈阳纺织八厂参观，看到这个厂的粗纺机工人在换纱时，先把飞翼拿下来，再把满纱棒拿下来，以后放上空纱管和飞翼。这样作法，很浪费时间。我厂粗纺机工人换纱，是右手拿飞翼，左手拿空纱管；用空纱管在满纱棒底下一顶，满纱棒就上去了，左手放上空纱管，右手安上飞翼，根本不需要把飞翼拿下来再放下。我建议沈阳纺织八厂领导干部，动员工人把我厂这个操作法在粗纺机上试验一下，也许可以推广。如果不能推广的话，也请来信告知原因。
