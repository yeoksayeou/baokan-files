　　Shanxi Province Establishes Over 7,000 Agricultural Technology Dissemination Organizations
　　This Spring, Technical Skills Were Transferred to 300,000 Farmers, Forming a Mass Technical Improvement Movement
　　During this year's patriotic production increase movement, all areas of Shanxi Province have universally emphasized the promotion of advanced agricultural science and technology and the bumper harvest experiences of model laborers. A technical promotion network, led by state-owned farms, bridged by technical dissemination stations, centered on village technical committees, and based on mutual aid teams, has been widely established and improved throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from seventy counties, under the leadership of the government and state-owned farms, 7,123 village technical committees and 245 technical dissemination stations have been established. These over 7,000 technical dissemination organizations have transferred technology to approximately 300,000 farmers this spring. As a result, agricultural science and technology, especially the bumper harvest experiences of model laborers, have been universally promoted throughout the province.
　　The leading role of state-owned farms in technology promotion became even more evident during this year's spring plowing and sowing. Before the spring plowing and sowing, the Yangqu County Farm trained 2,789 people, including model laborers, mutual aid team leaders, experienced veteran farmers, and production cadres. Based on this, Yangqu County established 30 dissemination stations, 109 technical committees, 35 small farms, and 4 fine seed breeding areas; moreover, every village had seed retention plots (totaling 1,090 mu). During the "May 1st" Labor Day, the farm held a small exhibition, which was visited by more than 10,000 people. The technology promotion network under the leadership of the Wuxiang County Farm has explained and taught technology to more than 24,000 people. This year, technical dissemination stations have been universally established and improved in various places, which is a good form of technology dissemination. After learning the technology, the district cadres in the fourth district of Gaoping went to five technical dissemination stations to impart technology, so that the majority of farmers learned and mastered advanced technology. In addition to regularly imparting general farming techniques to farmers, the technical dissemination stations in various places have also held specialized technical dissemination sessions on agricultural tools, medicines, and seed soaking and mixing, all with good results. Most dissemination stations hire model laborers to personally impart technology, which is the most practical and useful dissemination. (Shanxi Daily)

    山西省已建立七千多个农业技术传授机构
    今春向三十万农民传授了技术，形成了群众性的技术改良运动
    山西省各地在今年爱国丰产运动中，普遍重视了推广先进的农业科学技术和劳动模范的丰产经验。全省广泛建立和健全了以国营农场为领导、技术传授站为桥梁、村技术委员会为核心、互助组为基础的技术推广网。据七十个县不完全的统计，在政府和国营农场领导下，已建立起七千一百二十三个村技术委员会和二百四十五个技术传授站。这七千多个技术传授组织，在今年春季向三十万左右农民群众传授了技术。因此农业科学技术，特别是劳动模范的丰产经验，已在全省普遍推广。
    国营农场在技术推广中的领导作用，在今年春耕播种中更加明显了。阳曲县农场在春耕播种前，先后训练了劳动模范、互助组长、有技术的老农、生产干部等二千七百八十九人。在这个基础上，阳曲县建立了传授站三十个，技术委员会一百零九个，小农场三十五个，良种繁殖区四处；而且村村有了留种地（计一千零九十亩）。在“五一”劳动节，这个农场举办了小型展览会，有一万多人参观。武乡县农场领导下的技术推广网，先后向二万四千多人讲解和传授了技术。今年各地普遍建立和健全了技术传授站，这是传授技术的好形式。高平四区区干部学会技术后，便分别到五个技术传授站传授技术，使广大农民学会和掌握了先进技术。各地的技术传授站，除了定期地向农民进行一般耕作技术的传授以外，并举办了农具、药剂、浸拌种等专门技术传授，效果都很好。多数传授站聘请劳动模范亲自传授技术，这样的传授最实际，最有用。（山西日报）
