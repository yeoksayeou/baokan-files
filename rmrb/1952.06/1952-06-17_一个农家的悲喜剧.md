    A Peasant Family's Tragicomedy
    Lin Gang
    In the old society, the feudal marriage system was like a chain, locking up women. In Ranghe Street, Lushan County, Henan, there was a daughter-in-law named Bao Tonghua. Whether it was working in the fields or at home, she did everything beautifully; neighbors all praised her for being capable. But at home, she was a slave.
    Bao Tonghua is thirty-five years old this year, and she married into the family at the age of twenty. The marriage was arranged by her parents. Only after Tonghua entered the family did she realize that her husband was ill: he had nosebleeds, which had been going on for ten years, and he had a sallow complexion and wasn't very good at labor. She didn't dare to say it out loud, but it was easy to see that she was unwilling. Her mother-in-law and husband were determined to subdue their daughter-in-law through oppression. There were six people in her family: her father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband, two younger sisters-in-law, and herself. This middle-peasant family had a set of feudal order. The mother-in-law was wicked, and everyone within a few miles knew it. She was constantly finding fault with her daughter-in-law: the rice was too thick, the soup too thin, she wasted grain, she wasted thread... If the daughter-in-law visited neighbors, she would say she was "che chi feng" (unruly); when she went back to her parents' home, if the bundle she carried was too big, she would say she was "gui dao" (stealing) things. All the vicious words and insults to women that could be thought of were used to curse the daughter-in-law. The two daughters helped their mother torment their sister-in-law. The father-in-law was the type who only cared about labor and didn't ask about anything else. The husband, named Zhang Tongting, was really ruthless when he beat his wife. Every ten days or half a month, he would pick up a shovel, carrying pole, or stick... and beat his wife. Bao Tonghua was often beaten until her head bled. They would bolt the door at night and beat her; during the day, the mother-in-law would stand at the door, not allowing anyone to pull them apart. The mother-in-law would say to her son: "A daughter-in-law is like mud on the wall, tear off the old one and replace it with a new one." Bao Tonghua had tried every method to win the favor of her mother-in-law and husband, getting up before dawn and going to bed late to work, and being meticulous in everything she did, but all her efforts were in vain. She also thought about running away, but she was afraid of losing face for her parents' family, so she didn't dare. After being a daughter-in-law for a year, she had exhausted all hope of survival. In the second year after marrying into the family, she locked herself in the mill and tried to hang herself, but neighbors broke down the door and saved her. After that, she always kept opium in her pocket. Two years later, Bao Tonghua gave birth to a son, and only then did she give up the idea of seeking death. From then on, she lived for her son.
    The son was named Guanyin. When he was ten years old, his father never held him once, nor did he ever care about the child's clothes. When the child was four years old, the family planted two mu of cotton. From planting to harvesting, Bao Tonghua participated in many of the main tasks. After the cotton was picked, the mother-in-law picked out the good ones and selected one jin and thirteen liang of bad ones for her. Bao Tonghua was very unhappy, so she picked two jin of good cotton herself, wanting to spin it and make a new coat and pants for Guanyin. When the mother-in-law found out about this, she first told her son to beat her, and the next day she personally forced her to hand over the cotton. Bao Tonghua said: "Guanyin has grown up so much, he hasn't worn an inch of your cloth. I worked hard all autumn to plant this cotton, shouldn't he get to wear some?" How could a daughter-in-law dare to resist! The wicked mother-in-law had tormented her daughter-in-law with words for six or seven years, but this time she took action. She raised a stool and chased after her daughter-in-law around the yard; the two daughters also helped to beat her, and the elder daughter threw the bowl she was holding, soup and rice included, at her sister-in-law's head. Bao Tonghua hid in the home of her sixth sister-in-law in the same courtyard, and the three of them knocked down the other family's door and chased her inside. After this fight, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could no longer live together, so they invited her uncle to divide the family.
    After the family was divided, Bao Tonghua thought to herself: "If it's just the two of us, we won't get angry anymore, right!" She was wrong. The mother-in-law's authority still weighed on her head. Her husband treated her the same as before, beating her even if she didn't eat anything, and beating her even if she didn't wear anything. He constantly said "I'll divorce you" and "I'll sell you." Bao Tonghua was afraid in her heart, constantly crying, and her face was withered and yellow from crying. Their family's land was originally like a sandy beach. The couple's relationship was not good, so naturally they had no energy to produce well. They didn't even apply manure, and the weeds grew as tall as the corn.
    Lushan was liberated, and Bao Tonghua was emancipated. She was elected as a delegate to the county peasant representative congress and attended meetings in the county and district. Her mother-in-law secretly scolded her as "crazy," but she didn't care. She worked actively, and the women supported her. It's just that she thought she "had no luck with men and would never have a good life." She also thought: "Now women can live on their own by working. Why should I follow him and be beaten and abused day and night?" So, when Zhang Tonglu was the chairman of the farmers' association, she separated from her husband. From then on, the man didn't give the woman a single grain of salt or carry a single load of water; the woman didn't make the man a pair of shoes or sew a single stitch.
    Guanyin followed his mother, and the two of them were allocated two mu and six fen of land. Bao Tonghua carefully planned her days. She planted the two mu with staple grains and the rest with cotton, sweet potatoes, etc. She thought that farming year after year, it wouldn't be good to keep asking for help, so apart from plowing, sowing, and harrowing, she did the rest herself: harvesting wheat, weeding, cutting corn, turning sweet potato seedlings, and threshing and winnowing in the threshing ground. But the land was too poor, and the grain she harvested wasn't enough to eat; later, she rented out part of it and engaged in sideline production. She got up at the rooster's crow and spun cotton, wove cloth, and sewed shoe soles until midnight. In this way, she managed to make a living. In 1949, she sold shoes and bought a small piglet, and started raising pigs. It wasn't easy to raise this pig. She couldn't afford bran, so she went everywhere to collect water fleas, scavenge grass scraps, grind bean residue, and pick up melon rinds all by herself. She went door-to-door to ask for dishwater from families who didn't raise pigs in the eastern part of the street. She herself drove the pig to its pen (for mating). In half a year, the pig grew up, and the first litter had thirteen piglets. Bao Tonghua kept one for meat and exchanged the rest for more than one shi of grain. After that, she had two litters of piglets every year, which could be exchanged for three or four shi of grain, and her life became even better.
    In the new society, Bao Tonghua relied on her own labor and production, and her life changed from poverty to abundance. In addition, she actively participated in village work, changing her status in society and in the family. After Lushan was liberated, the thinking of her family members also improved. The two younger sisters-in-law, the older one got married, and the younger one joined the work force, and they both lived in the city. Chairman Mao had educated them to understand reason, and they came back to persuade their mother to treat her daughter-in-law well and to sit at their sister-in-law's house. The father-in-law and mother-in-law often participated in meetings and understood what kind of world Chairman Mao was leading the new society to. Although the mother-in-law still didn't like her daughter-in-law, she no longer dared to curse in the streets. Her husband's illness, after eating a thousand eggs and five jin of sugar, no longer occurred frequently; he worked much harder than before; in the wheat season the year before last, he became a militia member in the village. The feudal order of this middle-peasant family had disintegrated. It was just that the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and between husband and wife was still not harmonious. "Reverse door gods don't face each other." They didn't say a word to each other when they met.
    In May the year before last, Chairman Mao promulgated the Marriage Law. The district government was located in Ranghe Street, and the propaganda work was done very well. Zhang Tongting was in the militia, and Bao Tonghua was a representative, and the two of them also publicized the Marriage Law to the masses. But when they talked about Article 8, it touched their hearts. The text of Article 8 is: "Husbands and wives have the obligation to love, respect, help, and support each other, to live in harmony and unity, to engage in labor and production, to raise children, and to strive together for the happiness of the family and the construction of the new society."
    Zhang Tongting's thinking had been improving day by day for the past two years, and his attitude towards women had also greatly changed. Ever since he separated from his wife, he often thought of his wife's good points and regretted that he shouldn't have abused her in the first place. His two younger sisters had left home, and he couldn't even dress himself. The coat he was wearing had been worn for two years and hadn't been taken apart and washed. The elbows were already tattered. His mother often went to visit her daughters, leaving him and his son, and no one cooked for them. The noodles he cut were thicker than chopsticks; when he cooked, he didn't know how much water or how much food to use, nor did he know how to make it ripe, salty, or bland. He felt that the Marriage Law, which called for family harmony, was most agreeable to his temperament.
    Bao Tonghua no longer worried about what to eat or wear now, but living on her own always had its difficulties. For example, she had to ask people to help her sow and plow the land. Her parents-in-law were old and needed someone to take care of them. Moreover, since liberation, especially since she started living independently, the attitude of her mother-in-law and husband towards her had obviously changed. When the mother-in-law made dumplings, she always brought two bowls over. She also often heard people say that her mother-in-law and husband praised her in secret. From a broader perspective, Bao Tonghua had suffered since she was a child, and she was emancipated after liberation. She was most grateful to Chairman Mao, and she always took the lead in doing whatever Chairman Mao called for. She said: "Now that Chairman Mao is calling for family harmony, how can I not listen?"
    During the autumn weeding season, about a month or so after the Marriage Law was promulgated, one day, Guanyin was working in the fields. Zhang Tongting walked past the edge of the field, saw him, stopped, and said:
    "Guanyin, let me weed the field for you!"
    Guanyin was not very old, but he was very sensible. These days, he had also often heard people publicize the Marriage Law. He stared at this father who had given birth to him but had not raised him for a while and said:
    "Weed it, tell Mom to make you oil cakes for lunch!"
    He told his mother when he went back for lunch. His mother told him to bring his father back for dinner that night. At dusk, Zhang Tongting came with Guanyin. When they got to the door, Bao Tonghua was drawing water. Zhang Tongting looked at the pulley over the well and said: "I weeded the field for you today, I'm here to eat your food." Bao Tonghua lifted the second bucket of water to the mouth of the well and said: "Come and sit in the house!" She prepared oil cakes and also made dishes. After dinner, Zhang Tongting smoked a bag of tobacco and left. The next day was the same. The third day was still the same. On the fourth day, after dinner, Zhang Tongting sat on the small stool again, smoking. Bao Tonghua washed the pot, washed the dishes, and fed the pigs again. It was already very dark. Zhang Tongting was still sitting there, smoking. Bao Tonghua asked: "Where are you staying tonight?" Zhang Tongting said: "I'm not leaving!"
    From that day on, more than a year had passed, and the couple lived more and more harmoniously. There was someone in the fields, and there was someone at home. During the autumn and wheat seasons, men and women went to the fields to work together, and when winnowing, the men took the lead and the women helped out. The work of driving the pigs to their pen had been transferred to the man. Bao Tonghua was really capable. With someone doing the field work, the money she earned from weaving cloth and spinning cotton was enough for the whole family to wear. The whole family had cotton clothes for winter and single-layer clothes for summer, all made by herself. The man now treated the woman much better than before: If the woman wanted to make shoes for sale, the man would plant half a mu of hemp; if the woman was in a hurry to go to a meeting, the man would say: "I'll wash the pot." Zhang Tongting was literate, and last winter he encouraged Bao Tonghua to go to winter school: "There are even people holding babies in winter school, why don't you sign up too." Bao Tonghua said: "I'll go when my toothache gets better." They discussed everything in advance when something came up at home. Guanyin had become a spoiled child. The couple discussed saving some money and sending him to middle school in the city after he graduated from elementary school. The mother-in-law also especially doted on Guanyin. The mother-in-law now also knew that her daughter-in-law was her daughter-in-law. Bao Tonghua also respected her parents-in-law, and when the old people had a headache or fever, she would bring hot soup and hot rice to them. Last winter, during the days when the central inspection team for the implementation of the Marriage Law came to Lushan, cadres from the district and the township women's federation helped them hold a family meeting and decided that the whole family should live together. A plan was made at the family meeting to turn the ten or so mu of sandy and barren land into fertile fields, and when this litter of pigs came down, it could be exchanged for more than two shi of corn, and then a donkey would be raised. The house hadn't been repaired for many years, and it had to be repaired well this year. The couple now had laughter and jokes. On the day I went to visit, Zhang Tongting said: "Guanyin's mother, some people say that the Marriage Law is a divorce law. Today, Comrade Lin from the county is here, why don't we get a divorce too?" Bao Tonghua said: "Marriage Law Article 27, you only remember this one article! If it weren't for Chairman Mao's Marriage Law, our family of five would be scattered and living worse and worse."
    Bao Tonghua gave birth to Guanyin twenty years ago and is now pregnant again.

    一个农家的悲喜剧
    林钢
    在旧社会里，封建的婚姻制度，像条锁链，锁着妇女。河南鲁山县瀼河街有个媳妇，名叫暴同花。无论地里活，家里活，都做得漂漂亮亮；街坊邻居都夸奖她利亮，可是在家里她却是奴隶。
    暴同花今年三十五岁，二十岁过的门，婚姻是父母包办的。同花过门来才知道男人有病：流鼻血，前后流了十年，黄巴脸子，劳动也不很好。嘴上不敢说，心里可不愿意，这是很容易看出来的。婆婆和丈夫决心用压迫手段来制服媳妇。她家有六口人：公公、婆婆、丈夫、两个小姑和她。这个中农家庭有着一套封建秩序。婆婆心恶，几里地以内都知道。她成天找媳妇的错，饭稠啦，汤稀啦，费粮啦，费线啦……媳妇串门子，说她“扯风”（不规矩），走娘家时，拿的包袱大了，说是“鬼捣”
    （偷）东西。凡是能够想到的恶毒话和侮辱妇女的字眼，都用来咒骂媳妇。两个女儿帮着娘折磨嫂子。公公是个只管劳动，百事不问的人。丈夫名叫张同廷，打起老婆来真狠。隔不了十天半月，铁锨、扁担、杆杖……拿起来就打老婆。暴同花常被打得顺头流血。黑夜闩住门打；白天，婆母站住门，不叫人拉。婆婆对儿子说：“媳妇是墙上的泥皮，揭了旧的换新的。”暴同花曾经用尽方法来取得婆婆和丈夫的欢心，起五更睡半夜地干活，凡事都严严谨谨，可是这种努力都白费了。也想逃跑过，可是怕丢娘家的人，没敢。做了一年媳妇，消磨尽了求生的念头。过门第二年，自己关在磨房里上过吊，邻居破门救活了她。以后她衣袋里没有断过大烟。又过了两年，暴同花生了一个男孩子，这才算打消了寻死的念头，以后的日子她是为儿子活着的。
    儿子取名官印，长到十岁，做父亲的没有抱过一回，也从来没有管过孩子的穿戴。孩子四岁那年，家里种了二亩棉花。从种花到收花，暴同花参加了许多主要劳动。花摘回来，婆婆把好的拣拣，挑了一斤十三两坏的给她。暴同花心里很不痛快，就自己拣了二斤好花，想轧轧给官印换身袄裤。这事叫婆婆知道了，先吩咐儿子打了一顿，第二天又亲自逼她拿出花来。暴同花说：“官印长这么大，没穿过你一寸布。种这花俺忙了一秋，就不应份穿点？”媳妇敢反抗，那还了得！恶婆婆六七年来折磨媳妇用的是嘴，这回动了手。她举起凳子满院转，追着打媳妇；两个闺女也帮着打，大闺女把手里端的碗，连汤带饭往嫂子头上摔。暴同花躲到同院六嫂家里，娘儿三个把人家的门拥倒追了进去。经过这一次打闹，婆媳俩再也不能在一起过了，把舅舅请来分了家。
    分开家，暴同花心里想：“两口子过，可不会生气了吧！”她想错了。婆婆的威严仍旧压在她的头上。丈夫待她也和从前一样，吃不到嘴里也打，穿不到身上又打。张嘴“休你”，合嘴“卖你”。暴同花心里害怕，整天流泪，脸哭得焦毛黄。他们家的地，原来就像沙滩一样，夫妻感情不好，自然都没劲好好生产，连粪也不上，草长得和玉米一样高。
    鲁山解放了，暴同花翻了身。她当选为县农民代表大会的代表，上县里开过会，上区里开过会。婆婆背地里骂她“疯障”，她不管；她工作积极，妇女们拥护她。只不过她以为自己“和男人没缘法，永世过不成了”。又想：“现在女人家自己劳动也能过活，为啥黑地白日跟着他挨打受气呢？”就在张同禄当农会主席的时候，她和丈夫分了家。从此，男的不管女的一两盐、不给挑一担水；女的也不给男的做一双鞋、缝一针线。
    官印跟娘，娘儿两个分得二亩六分地。暴同花细心地安排着自己的日子。二亩地种主要粮食，其他种点棉花、红薯等。她想，年长日久种地，光央求人家也不是办法，所以除掉犁地，耩地，耙地以外，其余割麦，锄草，砍玉米，翻红薯秧，场上打打扬扬，都自己动手。可是地太薄，打的粮食不够吃；后来便出租了一部分，自己搞副业生产。鸡叫就起床，夜里纺花、织布、纳鞋底，一直到半夜。这样，生活就顾住了。一九四九年做卖鞋换了个小猪娃，又喂起猪来。喂这口猪可不容易啦，买不起糠，她独个上四外捞水蜉，捞渣草，搓豆沫，拾瓜皮。东街没喂猪的人家，她挨门挨户去要涮锅水。自己赶猪放圈（猪交配）。半年，猪长大了，第一窝见了十三个小猪娃。暴同花留了一个肉猪，其余换了一石多粮食。以后每年生两窝猪娃，可换三四石粮食，生活就更加好起来。
    在新社会里，暴同花依靠自个劳动生产，生活由贫困过到富足；加上她积极参加村里的工作，改变了自己在社会上和家庭里的地位。鲁山解放以后，家里人的思想，也都有了进步。两个小姑大的出嫁了，小的参加了工作，都在城里住。毛主席把她们教育得懂道理了，回来劝娘要好好待媳妇，也上嫂子家坐坐。公公婆婆常参加会，也懂得了毛主席领导的新社会是啥世道。婆婆虽说还是看不惯媳妇，可是再也不敢骂街了。丈夫的病，吃了千把个鸡蛋、五斤糖，也已不常发了；劳动比以前强多了；前年麦季里，他又在村里当了民兵。这个中农家庭的封建秩序已经瓦解了。只不过婆媳和夫妻之间，还是不和睦，“反贴门神不对脸”，谁见了谁都不说一句话。
    前年五月，毛主席颁布了婚姻法。瀼河街上住着区的机关，宣传工作做得很好。张同廷在民兵队上，暴同花是代表，两人也向群众宣传婚姻法。可是一讲到第八条，就触着他俩的心事了。第八条的条文是：“夫妻有互爱互敬、互相帮助、互相扶养、和睦团结、劳动生产、抚育子女、为家庭幸福和新社会建设而共同奋斗的义务。”
    张同廷这二年思想天天在进步，对妇女的态度，也大有转变。他自从和老婆分开住，常想到老婆的好处，后悔当初不该虐待她。两个妹子出了门，自己穿也穿不上了，身上的袄穿了二年，没拆过，胳膊肘已经稀巴烂。娘常走闺女家，留他爷儿俩，没人做饭，切个面条比筷子还粗；做饭弄菜，也不知道稀稠，也不知道生熟、咸淡。婚姻法叫家庭和睦，他听了最对脾胃。
    暴同花如今吃的穿的都不愁了；可是自个过日子，总也有困难。比方耩地、犁地都得央求人。公婆老了，也得有人照管。再说，解放以来，特别是从她独立生活以来，婆婆和丈夫对她的态度显然有了转变。婆婆包了饺子，总端两碗过来。她还常听人说，婆婆和丈夫背地里夸奖媳妇。从大处说，暴同花因为从小受苦受罪，解放以后才翻了身，她是最领谢毛主席的恩情了，毛主席号召干啥，她总是领头干。她说：“如今毛主席号召家庭和睦，俺能不听？”
    锄秋的时候，大约是婚姻法颁布后的个把月，有
    一天，官印在地里做活。张同廷打地头走过，见了，站下说：
    “官印，我给你锄地吧！”
    官印年纪不大，却很懂事。这些日子他也常听人宣传婚姻法。他向着这个生了他而不曾养育过他的爸爸，呆望了一会，说：
    “锄吧，晌午叫娘给你烙油馍！”
    晌午回去他告诉了娘。娘叫他晚上领爸爸回来吃饭。傍黑，张同廷跟着官印来了。走到门口，暴同花正在打水。张同廷望着井上的辘轳说：“今天给你锄地，来吃你的饭了。”暴同花把第二桶水提到井口说：“上屋里坐吧！”她准备了油馍，还做了菜。吃罢饭，张同廷吸袋烟，就走了。第二天又是那样。第三天还是那样。第四天吃罢饭，张同廷又坐在小凳上吸烟。暴同花涮锅，洗碗，又喂了猪，天已经很黑了。张同廷还坐在那里抽着烟。暴同花问：“今黑在那里住？”张同廷说：“我不走了！”
    从那一天以后，已经过了一年多，两口子越过越和美。地里有人，家里也有人。秋麦两季，男女一齐上地干活，扬场放滚，男的领着做，女的搭把手。赶猪放圈的活已经移交给男的。暴同花真能干，地里活有人做了，她织布纺花赚的钱够全家穿戴。一家子冬天棉的，夏天单的，全凭自己做。男的现在待女的比起从前来真可说是好多了：女的要做卖鞋，男的就种半分麻；女的急着开会去，男的说：“我来涮锅。”张同廷是识字的人，去年冬天动员暴同花上冬学：“冬学里还有抱孩子的呢，你也去报名吧。”暴同花说：“等牙痛好了，俺自会去的。”家里有事，都事先商量。官印成了娇儿，夫妻俩商量着攒点钱，等官印在完全小学毕了业，就把他送到城里上中学。婆婆也特别心疼官印。婆婆如今也晓得媳妇是她的媳妇了。暴同花也尊敬公婆，老人家有个头痛脑热，热汤热饭端到跟前。去年冬天，婚姻法执行情况中央检查组到鲁山那几天，区里的干部和乡妇联的干部帮助他们开了个家庭会议，决定全家合在一堆了。家庭会议上订了计划，准备把十来亩沙盘薄地变成肥田，等这窝猪下来，又可换二石多玉米，到时再喂头驴。住房多年没修理了，今年要好好修理一下。两口子现在是有逗有笑。我去访问的那一天，张同廷说：“官印他娘，有人说婚姻法是离婚法，今儿县上林同志在，咱也打离婚吧？”暴同花说：“婚姻法二十七条，你光记这一条！不是毛主席的婚姻法，俺一家五口零散着过，越过越不成人家了。”
    暴同花二十年前生了官印，现在又怀孕了。
