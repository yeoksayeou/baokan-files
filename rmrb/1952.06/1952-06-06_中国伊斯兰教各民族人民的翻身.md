    The Liberation of People of All Ethnic Groups of Islam in China
    Han Daoren
    In the past, people generally referred to the Hui nationality and other ethnic groups who believe in Islam as "Hui Muslims" or "Huihui," which is incorrect. In reality, it is not only the Hui nationality that believes in Islam within China, but also the Uygur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Tajik, Salar, and Dongxiang nationalities. These nine nationalities account for a population of about ten million.
    Distribution of Various Ethnic Groups
    Among these nine nationalities, the Hui nationality has the largest population, estimated at over five to six million people, and is also the most widely distributed. The main settlement area of the Hui people is in the Linxia, Haiyuan, and Guyuan counties of Gansu Province in the Northwest region, with a total of over 760,000 people. Followed by Shaanxi, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces. There are about 1.5 million people in the provinces of the entire Northwest region. In addition to the Northwest, there are also a large number of people living in Yunnan in the Southwest region, Shandong in the East China region, Henan in the Central South region, Hebei in the North China region, and Beijing and Tianjin. The rest are scattered throughout the country.
    The remaining eight nationalities mainly reside in Xinjiang and the Northwest region. The Uyghur nationality is second only to the Hui nationality in terms of population, with about 3.4 million people, residing throughout Xinjiang and accounting for more than 70% of the total population of Xinjiang. The Kazakh nationality has a population of over 400,000, mainly residing in the five special districts of Ashan, Yili, Tacheng, Dihua, and Hami in Xinjiang. In addition, there are hundreds of people at the junction of Jiuquan and Yumen in Gansu, and dozens of Kazakh households in Minhe County, Qinghai. The Kyrgyz nationality has about 60,000 to 70,000 people, scattered in Tex, Zhaosu, Kashgar, Jiashi, Puli, Wuqia, Wensu, Akqi, and Ushi counties in Xinjiang. The Tajik nationality has a population of about 50,000 to 60,000, mainly residing in Puli, Shache, and Zepu counties on the Pamir Plateau in Xinjiang. The Dongxiang nationality has a population of over 100,000, mainly residing in the current Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Gansu Province (formerly belonging to Linxia area) and its neighboring counties. The Salar nationality has a population of about 30,000, mainly residing in Xunhua and Hualong counties in Qinghai Province and the area west of Linxia in Gansu Province. The Uzbek nationality has a population of about 10,000, mainly residing in Kashgar, Yili, Tacheng, Dihua, Qitai, Mulei River, Shache, and Yecheng counties in Xinjiang. The Tatar nationality has a population of about 6,000, living in Yili, Tacheng, Dihua, and Ashan in Xinjiang.
    The Massacres and Resistance Struggles of Various Ethnic Groups in Old China
    The reactionary rulers of past dynasties adopted policies of suppression, discrimination, division, and assimilation against ethnic minorities. The Manchu Qing Dynasty, in particular, was the darkest ethnic prison. The Kuomintang's reactionary Han chauvinist rule deepened the disaster for ethnic minorities. People of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam were firm resisters of ethnic oppression policies. Zuo Zongtang, the great executioner of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, massacred millions of Hui, Uygur, and other ethnic groups in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other places in the Northwest who resisted reactionary rule. In 1764, the Manchu Qing army stationed in Xinjiang forcibly conscripted 10,000 young women from southern Xinjiang to Yili to serve as maids for the army, which caused large-scale armed resistance from all ethnic groups. The Manchu Qing army exterminated the people of the entire Ushi county in suppressing this riot. In 1876, Zuo Zongtang massacred more than one million people in Xinjiang. However, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were not intimidated. From 1876 to the Xinhai Revolution, the people of Xinjiang launched more than 400 large and small armed riots. During the period of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the Kuomintang government intensified its heinous oppression of all ethnic groups. Sheng Shicai massacred more than 100,000 revolutionary youths from 1941 to 1943. During the entire era of Manchu Qing and Kuomintang rule, it is estimated that the Uyghur population decreased by more than half. The past experiences of the Hui people in the Northwest under the rule of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs is even more a history full of blood and tears. In 1928, the Hui people of Hezhou (i.e., Linxia) launched an armed riot due to the brutal exploitation of the Chiang bandit gang and suffered bloody suppression by the bandit army. This time, the Chiang bandit army massacred more than 10,000 Hui people, burned all the Hui buildings in Hezhou, and looted them extensively, causing tens of thousands of Hui people to be displaced. At that time, a folk song circulated: "The green seedling tax, the chimney tax, squeezes the people into utter poverty. The Han people are not moved, forcing the Hui to rebel." From 1939 to 1941, thousands of Hui people in Haiyuan and Guyuan were killed in three uprisings. The Kuomintang reactionaries also bought over Ma family bandit gangs, who were degenerates of the Hui people, to massacre Hui people. In 1943, Ma Bufang provoked the struggle between the new and old sects in the Linxia area. Ma's bandits forced the pseudo-commissioner to replace the old sect's Ahongs and demolish the old sect's mosques. The angered masses killed the pseudo-commissioner Ma Bailing for this. Ma Bufang then dispatched a large number of bandit troops to massacre hundreds of Hui and Dongxiang people. During the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of Hui households in Ningxia collectively fled to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region under the leadership of the Communist Party because they could not bear the exploitation of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs. In the old China under reactionary rule, the Hui people all over the country, such as the Hui people in Yunnan, Shandong, and Hebei, had countless tragic histories of being massacred and oppressed.
    In New China, They Have Become Masters of the Country
    In the liberated New China, under Chairman Mao's policy of ethnic equality, all ethnic minorities have begun to realize ethnic regional autonomy and establish ethnic democratic joint governments in accordance with the Common Program. They manage their own affairs and have truly become masters of the country. In the old liberated areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, there were Hui autonomous townships and villages ten years ago. In the old liberated areas such as Shandong, many Hui autonomous townships and towns were established as early as the Anti-Japanese War period. In counties and districts with a large Hui population, there were also Hui county heads, district heads, and other administrative personnel. Soon after the liberation of Suiyuan, the Guisui City Hui Autonomous Region was established. The Dongxiang nationality, with a population of only over 100,000, has established an autonomous regional people's government in their settlement area. People of the Hui nationality throughout the country have their own representatives participating in the work of governments at all levels. The Central People's Government has Liu Geping as a member; the Gansu Provincial People's Government has Ma Hongbin, a Hui, as its vice chairman; and the Qinghai Provincial Vice Chairman is Ma Fuchen, a Hui. Nearly fifty Hui people are members of the people's governments above the provincial and municipal levels (including the Great Administrative Regions). In areas with a large Hui population, there are also many Hui people serving as mayors, county heads, and other administrative personnel. The Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Burhan, and the Vice Chairman, Saifuddin, are both Uyghurs. The governments at all levels in Xinjiang Province are managed by representatives of their own ethnic groups. According to statistics, among the 80 counties (cities) in the province, 67 are headed by ethnic minority officials. Among the administrative personnel at all levels, there are more than 17,000 veteran cadres who have been tempered by the Yili Revolution. In Puli County, among the Tajik ethnic group, no one had ever been an administrative official in the past, but now more than 150 cadres have participated in the work of the People's Government. These are all unprecedented in the history of all ethnic groups. They know that only under Chairman Mao's ethnic policy can ethnic minorities be politically liberated; and only under Chairman Mao's banner can all ethnic groups develop and advance.
    The political consciousness of the liberated people of all ethnic groups has been unprecedentedly raised. In the great nationwide movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they have displayed a high degree of patriotism. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enthusiastically responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and donated 30 airplanes and 7 artillery pieces. More than 90% of the people of all ethnic groups in cities such as Dihua signed the peace declaration. The Hui people across the country also actively participated in this movement. In the places where the Hui people live in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Guisui, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Cangxian, Lanzhou, Pingliang, Xining, Yinchuan and other places, there have been demonstrations or grand gatherings of 3,000 to 40,000 people. The Dongxiang Autonomous Region Delegates' Conference resolved to donate a "Dongxiang" cannon. The Imams of the Eight Squares in Yinchuan jointly initiated the donation of a "Hui People" fighter plane by the Ningxia Hui nationality. They all used practical actions to express their love for the motherland and hatred for U.S. imperialism; they have firm confidence in opposing aggression, defending the motherland, and defending peace. They expressed unlimited sympathy and concern for the struggle of the people of Middle Eastern Arab countries—Egypt, Iran, and others—to fight for independence and liberation and oppose U.S. and British imperialism, and they supported their struggle with practical actions.
    Began a Happy Life
    In liberated China, under Chairman Mao's correct ethnic policy, all ethnic minorities have begun to get rid of the poverty, backwardness, and disasters inflicted on them by the ruling classes of past dynasties, especially the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have begun to establish their own happy new lives.
    In the old liberated areas of Shandong, Hebei, and other places, the Hui people and the Han people have jointly solved the land problem, and their economic life has gradually improved. For example, the Hui people in Changguan Town, Ningjin County, Shandong Province, had an average of only seven fen of land per person before the land reform. The Han landlords there had a rule that no one was allowed to sell land to the Hui people. After the land reform, they and the Han people were liberated together, and now they have an average of more than two mu of land per person, and under the help and leadership of the People's Government, they have launched a production increase movement and have initially gotten rid of poverty and hunger. The Hui people living in the cities have also begun to change the impoverished lives of petty traders and people with no fixed occupations. Under the direct assistance of the People's Government, more than 1,000 Hui people in Beijing have turned to industrial production and participated in various construction projects in the past year or so. With the help of the People's Government, the Hui people in Jinan City established a match factory. The Hui people in Taian, Shandong, established a sack factory. Beijing, Tianjin, and many other cities have paid attention to finding ways to enable the Hui people to transfer to work in various production enterprise departments. Many Hui people have obtained employment and improved their lives.
    The Hui, Dongxiang, Salar and other ethnic groups in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, who have been liberated from the rule of bandit gangs such as Ma Bufang for more than a year, first recovered the land occupied by war criminals such as Ma Bufang. Ma Xingcheng, an 81-year-old Hui in Miaojia Village, Gucheng Township, Linxia County, said after being allocated land: "Ma Bufang dispatched 'military expenses' twice: the first time I sold my only two mu of land and an ox to pay; the second time he arrested my son. Later, my son died, my daughter-in-law remarried, and only two old people who had not died and two grandsons under the age of two were left in the family. When the Communist Party came, they took back our land. I will never forget Chairman Mao."
    At present, the land reform in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai in the Northwest has been basically completed, and poor farmers have been allocated land, as well as a large amount of other means of production and living materials. The Hui and Dongxiang peoples have also received their share of land and are carrying out large-scale production with the Han people to build a new life. In the struggle for political and economic liberation, the peoples of all ethnic groups have united unprecedentedly. In the Northwest, the Hui and Han people have jointly accused the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs and the landlord class of their crimes, recognized the common enemy, and their political consciousness has been unprecedentedly raised. For example, half of the residents in the second administrative village of the first district of Yongjing County, Gansu, are Hui people. There is very little land in this village, and the Han farmers in the first, third, and fourth administrative villages automatically gave some of their good land and houses to the Hui people. In the past, due to the rule and instigation of the Ma Bufang bandit gang, the Hui, Han, and Tibetan people at the junction of Linxia and Xiahe often had disputes. After the land reform, the Hui and Han people in Linxia automatically took 10 million yuan worth of gifts from the fruits of victory and sent them to the poor Tibetan people, and sent 500 representatives to hold a solidarity and friendship meeting with the Tibetan people. Such examples are everywhere.
    The People's Government's policy of equal exchange in trade has increased the purchasing power of the people of all ethnic groups. In the Linxia area, where the Hui people live, the sales of cloth and general merchandise have increased more than twofold. The people of the Dongxiang ethnic group said: "For decades, we couldn't wear cotton clothes in winter; after the People's Government was established, we wore three new cotton clothes." (i.e., new surface, new lining, new cotton.)
    The Uygur, Kazakh, Uzbek...and other ethnic groups living in Xinjiang are mainly engaged in animal husbandry and agricultural production. In the past year or so, due to the People's Government's construction of water conservancy projects and the development of various undertakings conducive to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the cultivated land area in Xinjiang Province has increased by 24.04% compared with 1949, and the output has increased by 34.1%; the cotton field has increased by 9.56%, and the cotton output has increased by 28.78%. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang reclaimed more than 800,000 mu of wasteland throughout last year and cooperated with the people of all ethnic groups to build eight water conservancy projects, including the Shawan Xinsheng Canal, the Taiping Canal, and the Xiaoguai Canal, and repaired 15 projects, including the Dihua, Yanqi Kaila Canal, and the Yili Huang Canal. The above-mentioned water conservancy projects directly increased the cultivated land by about 400,000 mu. Now most of the supplies of the troops stationed in Xinjiang can be self-sufficient, and it is planned to build water conservancy projects that irrigate 5 million mu of land by 1954, turning the barren Gobi Desert that has never been cultivated into fertile fields and green oases. These great creations and constructions have opened up a bright future for the agricultural development of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
    The People's Government has also gradually increased the purchase price of local products. Before liberation, a bolt of blue twill fabric in Dihua City could be exchanged for 402 catties of wool, but after reasonable adjustments after liberation, it could be exchanged for 43 catties of wool. The selling price of herders' local products has increased more than tenfold, and their lives have been greatly improved. The Kazakh, Tajik, and other ethnic groups who live entirely by nomadic life have begun to live a settled or semi-settled life with the help of the People's Government. For example, in Ashan Prefecture, 1,800 Kazakh households have settled down. In Puli County, which is inhabited by the Tajik ethnic group in the Pamir Plateau, many households also live a settled or semi-settled life.
    The people of all ethnic groups have not only begun to live a happy life economically, but also begun new construction in culture and education under the leadership and help of the People's Government. In the old liberated areas of Shandong Province, some Hui villages did not have a single literate person in the entire village in the past, but now they all have at least one primary school; the enrollment rate of school-age children has generally reached more than 50%. The Beijing Hui Nationality College has more than 1,000 students. The number of school-age Hui children enrolled in Beijing has increased from 40% in the past to 80%. In the past, there were only 14 Hui primary schools in Ningxia Province, but now it has increased to 22, and the number of students has increased from 1,288 to 8,863.
    Xinjiang has the Xinjiang Nationalities Institute, the highest institution of learning for the people of all ethnic groups; there are 30 secondary schools with more than 5,500 students; there are 1,950 primary schools with more than 259,500 students. The Kazakh, Tajik, and other ethnic groups have also established schools in their own ethnic languages. In Ashan Prefecture (the old revolutionary area of Yili), the Kazakh ethnic group has established one middle school, 15 primary schools, and one male and female central primary school each. The Kuomintang reactionary rulers cruelly destroyed the cultures of all ethnic groups and forced the people of all ethnic groups to learn Han Chinese; the People's Government has helped the people of all ethnic groups develop their own cultures. In Xinjiang after liberation, all ethnic groups not only use their own ethnic languages in their own schools, but also established their own ethnic news publishing enterprises and cultural institutions. Xinjiang Province already has eight newspapers, including the Xinjiang Daily in Uyghur, and three periodicals, as well as five Kazakh newspapers and periodicals. In addition, a large number of books in various languages have been published, and 63 theaters, cinemas, song and dance troupes, and other ethnic cultural groups have been restored and established, developing the cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups. The development of cultural and educational undertakings for all ethnic groups will enable them to get rid of their backward state forever and become a driving force for rapidly building their new lives.
    Ethnic Customs and Religious Beliefs are Respected
    The People's Government has faithfully implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief stipulated in the Common Program, which has quickly shattered the enemy's vicious rumors that "the Communist Party eliminates religion." On December 6, 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued a circular exempting the slaughter tax on cattle and sheep eaten by the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam during the three major festivals, which the people of all ethnic groups were very grateful for. The imams of mosques in Yinchuan issued a written statement saying: "This circular specifically shows the deep care and sincere concern of the Central People's Government for the people of all ethnic groups of Islam, and is a wise measure that has never been seen in China's history." During the "Eld" festival (i.e., the Muslim New Year), one of the three major festivals, local people's governments have stipulated holidays in places where ethnic groups who believe in Islam live. People of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam in institutions, schools, and factories in Xinjiang, the Northwest, and Beijing have taken holidays to celebrate their festivals. Whether it is a festival or ordinary times, religious people are free to go to the mosque to worship and pray. The People's Liberation Army is an example of respecting the living habits and freedom of religious belief of ethnic minorities. Just one example is enough to explain everything: In the process of liberating the Northwest, a certain division marched more than 100 miles one day and arrived at the three small villages of Baiyankou, etc. in the Hui area of mountainous land bordering Ningxia and Gansu. These three small villages have less than fifty households, and one-third of the buildings are mosques. This day happened to be a cold night with wind and rain; but no one from the People's Liberation Army entered the temple to take shelter from the rain, and all of them slept in the open outside the village. In order to respect the customs and habits of the Hui people, the soldiers would rather not eat vegetables than eat the pork and lard they carried with them. Because the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army correctly implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, it greatly encouraged the patriotic enthusiasm of the religious community. The religious community enthusiastically participated in the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. On May 20 last year, more than 3,500 ahongs, mullahs, and believers from 46 temples in Dihua City held a grand gathering to oppose the war of aggression and pray for world peace. Ahong Yang Wanlu, from the Guisui Hui Autonomous Region, donated one-third of the cattle and sheep skins he received during last year's "Eld" festival for the purpose of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Many ahongs and religious figures have participated in government work. For example, Liu Pinyi, the Grand Ahong of Cangxian, Hebei, is a member of the Provincial People's Government, and Cao Yaoxian Ahong of Qingdao is a member of the Shandong Provincial People's Government. All patriotic people of all ethnic groups are united around the banner of Mao Zedong. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong's ethnic policy.

    中国伊斯兰教各民族人民的翻身
    韩道仁
    过去一般人都把回族和信仰伊斯兰教的各民族统称为“回教人”或“回回”，这是不对的。实际上，中国境内信仰伊斯兰教的不仅是回族，还有维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克、柯尔克兹、塔塔尔、塔吉克、撒拉、东乡等民族。这九个民族约计有一千万上下的人口。
    各民族的分布情况
    这九个民族中，回族人口最多，约计有五百多万到六百万人，分布的地区也最广。回族人民的主要聚居区是西北区甘肃省的临夏、海原、固原等县，共约七十六万多人。其次是陕西、宁夏、青海、新疆各省。全西北区各省共约有一百五十万人左右。除西北外，居住在西南区的云南、华东区的山东、中南区的河南、华北区的河北以及北京、天津等省市的人数也较多。其余散居全国各地。
    其余八个民族主要聚居区是新疆和西北地区。维吾尔族在人数上仅次于回族，约有三百四十万左右，居住在新疆全境各地，人口占新疆总人口数的百分之七十以上。哈萨克族人口约有四十多万，主要居住区是新疆的阿山、伊犁、塔城、迪化、哈密等五个专区。此外，在甘肃酒泉和玉门交界处有数百人，青海的民和县也有数十户哈萨克人民居住。柯尔克兹族约有六、七万人，散居在新疆的特克斯、昭苏、喀什、伽师、蒲犁、乌恰、温宿、阿合奇、乌什等县。塔吉克族人口约五、六万人，主要居住区是新疆帕米尔高原的蒲犁、莎车、泽普等县。东乡族约有十多万人，主要聚居区是现在的甘肃省东乡族自治区（原属临夏地区）及其邻近各县。撒拉族人口约三万人，主要居住区为青海省的循化、化隆两县和甘肃省临夏以西地区。乌孜别克族约一万人，主要居住在新疆境内的喀什、伊犁、塔城、迪化、奇台、木垒河、莎车、叶城等县。塔塔尔族约六千多人，分住在新疆的伊犁、塔城、迪化、阿山等地。
    各族人民在旧中国被屠杀和进行反抗斗争的情况
    历代的反动统治者对少数民族都采取了镇压、歧视、分化和同化的政策，尤其满清王朝，是最黑暗的民族牢狱。国民党反动的大汉族主义统治更加深了少数民族的灾难。信仰伊斯兰教的各民族人民是民族压迫政策的坚决反抗者。满清王朝的大刽子手左宗棠，曾在西北的甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等地屠杀过数百万反抗反动统治的回、维等民族的人民。一七六四年，满清统治新疆的军队从南疆强征了一万个青年妇女到伊犁给军队充侍女，曾引起各民族的大规模的武装反抗。满清军队在镇压这次暴动中，杀绝了乌什全县的人民。一八七六年左宗棠在新疆屠杀过一百多万人。但是新疆各族人民并没有被吓倒，从一八七六年到辛亥革命止，新疆人民曾连续发动大小四百多次的武装暴动。在国民党反动统治时期，国民党政府更变本加厉地继续对各族人民进行罪恶的压迫。盛世才在一九四一到一九四三年间屠杀了十万以上的革命青年。在满清和国民党统治的整个年代，据估计，维吾尔族人口减少了一半以上。西北回族过去在蒋、马匪帮统治下的遭遇，更是一部充满血泪的历史。一九二八年，河州（即临夏）回民因不堪蒋匪帮的残酷压榨，发动了武装暴动，遭受了匪军的血腥镇压。这次，蒋匪军屠杀回民一万多人，烧毁河州回民的全部建筑，并大肆抢掠，使数万回民流离失所。当时流传着一首歌谣：“青苗款，烟囱款，刮得百姓实贫寒。刮得汉人不动弹，逼得回回造了反。”一九三九年到一九四一年间，海原、固原回民在三次起义中又被杀数千人。国民党反动派并收买回族败类马家匪帮屠杀回族人民。一九四三年马匪步芳在临夏地区挑起新旧教派的斗争，马匪强令伪专员撤换旧教阿訇，拆毁旧教清真寺，激愤的群众为此把伪专员马百良杀掉。马步芳便出动大批匪军屠杀了回族和东乡族人民数百人。在抗日战争时期，宁夏回族人民因不堪蒋、马匪帮的压榨，曾有数百户回民集体逃往在共产党领导下的陕甘宁边区。在反动统治的旧中国，全国各地回族人民，如云南、山东、河北等地的回族人民，都有着说不尽的被屠杀被压迫的惨痛史实。
    在新中国他们已经做了国家的主人
    在解放了的新中国，在毛主席的民族平等的政策下，各少数民族都开始按着共同纲领实现着民族区域自治及建立民族民主联合政府。他们管理着自己的事情，真正成了国家的主人。在老解放区陕甘宁边区，十年前就有了回民的乡、村自治区。在山东等地的老解放区，远在抗日战争时期就建立了不少回民的自治乡、镇。回民较多的县、区，并且有了回族的县长、区长等行政人员。绥远解放不久，就有归绥市回民自治区的成立。仅有十余万人口的东乡族，已在他们的聚居区建立了自治区人民政府。全国各地的回族人民，都有自己的代表参加了各级人民政府的工作。在中央人民政府有刘格平委员；甘肃省人民政府由回族人士马鸿宾任副主席；青海省的副主席是回族人士马辅臣。全国省市以上的人民政府委员（包括大行政区的）中有近五十名回族人士。在回族人口较多的地区，还有很多回族人士充任市长、县长及其他行政人员。新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉、副主席赛福鼎，都是维吾尔族。新疆省的各级人民政府，都由各民族自己的代表管理着自己的政权。据统计，全省八十个县（市）中，担任县长职务的少数民族人士就有六十七名。在各级行政人员中，有经过伊犁革命锻炼的老干部一万七千多人。蒲犁县的塔吉克民族，过去从来没有一个人是行政人员，现在已经有一百五十多个干部参加了人民政府工作。这些都是各民族历史上所没有见过的。他们知道，只有在毛主席的民族政策下，少数民族才能在政治上翻身；也只有在毛主席的旗帜下，各民族才能发展和前进。
    解放了的各族人民，政治觉悟空前地提高了。在全国伟大的抗美援朝运动中，他们发挥了高度的爱国主义的热情。新疆各族人民热烈响应中国抗美援朝总会的号召，捐献了飞机三十架、大炮七门。迪化等城市的各族人民，百分之九十以上都在和平宣言上签了名。全国回族人民也都积极参加了这一运动。北京、天津、沈阳、西安、归绥、武汉、郑州、济南、沧县、兰州、平凉、西宁、银川等地回族人民聚居的地方，都举行过三千人到四万人的示威游行或盛大集会。东乡自治区各界代表会决议捐献“东乡号”大炮一门。银川市八坊教长联名发起宁夏回族捐献“回民号”战斗机一架。他们都用实际行动表现了热爱祖国、仇恨美帝国主义的心情；他们有着反对侵略、保卫祖国、保卫和平的坚强信心。他们对中东阿拉伯国家——埃及、伊朗等国人民争取独立解放、反对美英帝国主义的斗争，寄与无限的同情和关怀，并以实际行动在声援他们的斗争。
    开始了幸福的生活
    在解放了的中国，全国各少数民族在毛主席的正确民族政策下，他们已开始摆脱了历代统治阶级特别是国民党反动统治给予他们的贫困、落后和灾难。在共产党和人民政府的领导下开始建立着自己幸福的新生活。
    在山东、河北等老解放区的回族人民和汉族人民一起解决了土地问题，经济生活逐渐上升。如山东宁津县长官镇的回民，土地改革前每人平均只有七分地。那里的汉族地主过去有一个规定，任何人不准许卖给回民土地。土地改革以后，他们和汉族人民一齐得到翻身，现在每人平均有土地二亩多，并且在人民政府的帮助和领导下开展了增产运动，初步摆脱了贫困和饥饿。居住在城市的回民，也在开始改变着贫困的小商贩和无固定职业的生活。北京市的回民在人民政府直接帮助下，一年多来，已有一千多人转向工业生产和参加了各项建设。济南市的回民在人民政府帮助下成立了火柴厂。山东泰安回民成立了麻袋工厂。北京、天津两市和其他很多城市都注意设法使回民转入各生产企业部门的工作，很多回民获得了职业，改善了生活。
    从马步芳等匪帮统治下解放出来一年多的甘肃、宁夏、青海的回族和东乡、撒拉等族人民，首先收回了战犯马步芳等霸占的土地。临夏县古城乡苗家村八十一岁的回民马兴成在分得土地以后说：“马步芳在时派了两次‘兵款’：第一次我是把仅有的二亩地和一头牛卖了交上的；第二次还是把我儿子抓走了。后来儿子死了，媳妇改嫁了，家中只剩下我们两个没死的老人和两个不满两岁的孙儿。共产党来了，要回了我们的土地。我永远忘不了毛主席。”
    现在西北的陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海四省的土地改革已基本完成，贫苦农民都分到了土地，并分到了大量的其他生产资料和生活资料。回族和东乡等族人民也同样分得了一份土地，和汉族人民一起进行大生产，建设新的生活。各族人民在政治经济的翻身斗争中，空前地团结起来。在西北各地的回汉人民，共同控诉了蒋、马匪帮和地主阶级的罪恶，认识了共同敌人，政治觉悟空前地提高了。如甘肃永靖县一区二行政村的居民，有一半是回民。这村土地极少，一、三、四行政村的汉族农民便自动把一部分好地好房让给回族人民。过去由于马步芳匪帮的统治和挑拨，临夏、夏河交界处的回、汉和藏族人民经常闹纠纷。土地改革后，临夏的回汉人民从胜利果实中自动拿出一千万元的礼物送给藏族的贫苦人民，并派五百名代表和藏族人民一起开了团结联欢会。这类事例到处可见。
    人民政府等价交换的贸易政策，提高了各族人民的购买力。在回族聚居的临夏地区，布匹、百货的销售量增加了两倍以上。东乡族的人民说：“几十年来，我们冬天穿不上棉衣；人民政府成立了，我们穿上了三新的棉衣。”（即新面，新里，新棉花。）
    居住在新疆的维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克……等民族，主要从事畜牧业和农业生产。一年多来，由于人民政府兴修水利和举办各种有利农牧业发展的事业，新疆省在农业方面，耕地面积比较一九四九年增加了百分之二十四点零四，产量增加了百分之三十四点一；棉田增加了百分之九点五六，皮棉产量增加了百分之二十八点七八。驻在新疆的人民解放军，去年全年垦荒八十多万亩，协同各族人民兴修了沙湾新盛渠、太平渠、小拐渠等八处水利工程，整修了迪化、焉耆开来渠和伊犁皇渠等十五处工程。上项水利的兴修，直接增垦的土地约四十万亩。现在驻新疆部队的大部生活资料已能自给，并计划到一九五四年兴修灌溉五百万亩的水利工程，使从古未曾垦种过的荒野戈壁变为良田绿洲。这些伟大的创造和建设，给新疆各族人民的农业发展开辟了美好的前程。
    人民政府收购土产的价格也逐渐提高。解放前在迪化市一匹青斜纹布要换羊毛四百零二市斤，解放后经过合理调整，换羊毛四十三市斤。牧民土产的卖价增加了十倍以上，他们的生活得到了很大的改善。哈萨克、塔吉克等完全过游牧生活的民族，在人民政府的帮助下，已开始过着定居或半定居的生活。如在阿山专区，已经有一千八百户哈萨克族人民定居下来。在帕米尔高原居住的蒲犁县塔吉克民族，也有很多户过着定居或半定居的生活。
    各族人民不仅已开始在经济上过着幸福的生活，在文化教育方面也在人民政府领导和帮助下开始新的建设。在山东省的老解放区，有些回民村过去全村没有一个识字的，现在都至少有一个小学了；学龄儿童入学的一般都达到了百分之五十以上。北京市回民学院，有学生一千多人。北京市回民学龄儿童入学数目由过去的百分之四十增加到百分之八十。过去宁夏全省只有十四所回族小学，现在已增加到二十二所，学生已由一千二百八十八人增加到八千八百六十三人。
    新疆有各族人民的最高学府新疆民族学院；有中等学校三十所，学生五千五百多人；有小学一千九百五十所，学生二十五万九千五百多人。哈萨克、塔吉克等民族也都建立了民族语文的学校。在阿山专区（伊犁革命的老区），哈萨克族已建立了中学一所、小学十五所和男、女中心小学各一所。国民党反动统治者曾残酷地摧毁各民族的文化，强迫各族人民学汉文汉语；人民政府则帮助各族人民发展自己的文化。在解放后的新疆，各民族不仅在自己的学校里使用本民族的语文，而且已创办了各民族自己的新闻出版事业和文化机关。新疆省已有维吾尔文的新疆日报等八种报纸和三种期刊以及哈萨克文的五种报刊。此外，并大量出版了各种文字的书籍，恢复和建立了六十三个剧院、影院、歌舞团等民族的文化团体，发展了各民族人民的文化生活。各族人民文化教育事业的发展，将使他们永远摆脱落后的状态，成为迅速建设自己新生活的推动力量。
    民族习惯和宗教信仰受到了尊重
    人民政府忠实地执行了共同纲领所规定的宗教信仰自由的政策，使敌人散布的“共产党消灭宗教”的恶毒谣言迅速破产了。一九五○年十二月六日，中央人民政府政务院发布了免征信仰伊斯兰教各族人民三大节日食用牛羊屠宰税的通令，各族人民非常感激。银川各清真寺教长曾发表书面谈话说：“这个通令具体地显示出中央人民政府对于伊斯兰教各族人民的深切照顾与真诚关怀，为中国有史以来未曾有过的贤明措施。”在过三大节日的“尔代”节（即穆历年节）时，在信伊斯兰教的各民族聚居的地方，当地人民政府都规定了假期。新疆和西北各地以及北京市等地的机关、学校、工厂中信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民，都放假欢度自己的节日。不管是节日或平时，宗教徒都可以自由地到清真寺去礼拜、祈祷。人民解放军更是尊重少数民族生活习惯和宗教信仰自由的模范。只举出一个例子就足以说明一切了：在解放西北的过程中，某师一天经过一百多里的长途行军，到达宁夏、甘肃交界的山地回民区白沿口等三个小村。这三个小村不到五十户人家，而三分之一的建筑是清真寺。这天恰恰又是一个风雨交加的寒夜；但人民解放军却没有一个人进寺内避雨，全部露宿村外。战士们为了尊重回民的风俗习惯，宁可不吃菜，也不吃自己携带的猪肉猪油。由于人民政府和人民解放军正确执行了宗教信仰自由的政策，大大地鼓励了宗教界的爱国主义热情。宗教界都踊跃参加了伟大的抗美援朝运动。去年五月二十日，迪化市四十六个寺坊的阿訇、毛拉、教徒等共三千五百余人举行了盛大集会，反对侵略战争，为世界和平而祈祷。归绥回民自治区的一位阿訇杨万禄把去年“尔代”节所得的牛羊皮的三分之一捐献出来，作抗美援朝之用。不少的阿訇和宗教界人士参加了政府工作。如河北沧县大阿訇刘品一是省人民政府委员，青岛的曹耀先阿訇是山东省人民政府委员。各族一切爱国的人民都团结在毛泽东旗帜的周围。这是毛泽东民族政策的伟大胜利。
