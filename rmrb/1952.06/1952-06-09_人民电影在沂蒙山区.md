People's Movies in the Yimeng Mountains
Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education Film Touring Projection Team, Ji Pu

Editor's Note: The Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education Film Touring Projection Team was established in 1951. Under the direct leadership of the Provincial Department of Culture and Education, it was composed of forty-six people who returned from projection training classes in Nanjing, forming eleven projection teams. Each team consisted of four people, equipped with a film projector and a slide projector. Their main task was to go deep into the vast countryside to carry out propaganda work such as projecting movies and slides, posting advertisements, and giving oral lectures. In the past year or so, the team traveled all over Shandong. According to the projection statistics of more than forty counties over four months, more than 3.7 million farmers watched movies and received education. Recently, they are preparing to develop the film projection team to twenty-two teams based on the existing foundation. This newsletter reports on the activities of the projection team in the Yimeng Mountains.

"Movies to the countryside" is the urgent request of farmers, especially the people in the old revolutionary base areas who have persisted in revolutionary struggles for a long time. After the land reform, they have turned over economically and their lives have become prosperous, and their cultural demands have also increased accordingly. They are eagerly looking forward to movies coming to the countryside, and they want to see the new people's movies, and see their leader Chairman Mao. After the film projection team of Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education was established, it went deep into the countryside and faced the farmers. The projection team set off for the first time last year, and went to the oldest anti-Japanese base area in Shandong – the Yimeng Mountains – to screen films. This news spread quickly to every corner of the Yimeng Mountains, and people were looking forward to seeing the people's movies and their leader Chairman Mao as soon as possible. The film team constantly received letters or phone calls from various places requesting to screen films.

When the film team arrived at Shiluzi, the seat of the Junan County People's Government, the people of the whole county were in an uproar. The rugged path from Shiluzi to the east is commonly known as "Nine Ridges and Eighteen Slopes," and horse-drawn carts could not pass through. The farmers said, "We have a way. If horse-drawn carts can't go, can't we carry the film projector?" The next day, sixteen young men came automatically. They found the film team and said, "We have been waiting for you for more than two months." They took turns carrying the more than 300-斤 generator and walked quickly. The comrades of the film projection team said, "Comrades, take a rest if you are tired!" They replied with enthusiasm, "We are not tired. Hearing about watching movies gives us energy." After walking thirty miles, they were really not tired at all.

Feixian County is a mountainous area, with high and numerous mountains. The main means of transportation here is the small donkey, and there are very few roads where wheelbarrows can be pushed, let alone horse-drawn carts. Zhuzi Mountain, Lian Mountain, Liang Mountain, and Meng Mountain are truly a series of peaks, with steep cliffs, deep valleys, and rapid water, making the terrain dangerous. The film team encountered many difficulties in the projection process, all of which were overcome with the support of the farmers. The heavy generator and large and small machine parts were all carried by the farmers themselves. Some mountain roads are difficult for us to walk on even empty-handed, but the farmers carrying the machines walk faster than us. When we were screening films in Lianhuazhuang, Dashaozhuang, Helezhuang, and Shijing, we took a few shots of them carrying the machines, and they were indescribably happy.

Very few people here have seen movies. When they heard that there was a movie, some people climbed over several high mountains, crossed several big rivers, and walked more than thirty miles to watch. Some people moved relatives and called their daughters a few days in advance, as lively as celebrating the Spring Festival. The audience at each movie was more than ten thousand people, truly a sea of people. After watching the movie at night, the masses lit lamps to go home, and many twinkling lights appeared on the south mountain. This place has screened movies twice from last year to this year, and more people watched it each time. The projection team has screened "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song," "Resist America, Aid Korea," and "Zhao Yiman" here, and the farmers have received great education. The songs from the movie "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song" have been sung in various villages.

The mountains in the Wulian Mountain area are even more numerous than in Feixian County. Four districts in Feixian County had not yet used people to carry machines, but in Wulian County, seventeen screenings were performed, and the machines were all carried by people. The comrades of the projection team not only had to walk and climb mountains to screen films, but also had to help the migrant workers carry the machines. We were welcomed and sent off by the farmers everywhere. After the screening in Chaohe Village, the masses were reluctant to let us leave. The Young Pioneers beat gongs and drums and shouted slogans, sending us to the entrance of the village, and said to us, "Comrades! Please come to our mountains to screen films more often in the future!"

    人民电影在沂蒙山区
    山东省文教厅电影巡回放映队　汲甫
    编者按：山东省文教厅电影巡回放映队于一九五一年成立，该队在省文教厅的直接领导下，由南京放映训练班学习归来的四十六人组成了十一个放映小队，每四人编成一个小队，每小队配备电影放映机和幻灯机各一部。他们的主要任务是深入广大农村进行放映电影、幻灯、贴广告、口头讲演等宣传工作。一年多以来，该队走遍了全山东，据四个月四十余县的放映统计，就有三百七十余万农民看到了电影，受到了教育。最近，他们准备使电影放映队在现有基础上发展到二十二个小队。这篇通讯报道了放映队在沂蒙山区的活动情形。
    “电影下乡”，这是农民的迫切要求，特别是长期坚持革命斗争的老根据地人民。他们在土地改革以后，经济上翻了身，生活富裕起来了，对文化要求也就随之提高了。他们热烈盼望着电影下乡，他们要看看人民的新电影。
    山东省文教厅电影巡回放映队成立了，它深入农村，面向农民。放映队去年首次出发，先到山东最老的抗日根据地——沂蒙山区去放映。这个消息，飞快地传遍了沂蒙山区每一个角落，人们都眼巴巴地盼望着早日看到人民的电影，看看自己的领袖毛主席。电影队不断收到各地要求去放映电影的信件或电话。
    电影队到达莒南县人民政府驻地十字路时，全县人民沸腾起来了。从十字路往东的那一段崎岖小路，俗话称为“九岭十八坡”，马车也不能通行。农民说：“我们有办法。马车不能走，我们不能去抬电影机吗？”第二天他们自动来了十六个小伙子，他们找到了电影队，一开口就说：“俺盼你们盼了两个多月了。”他们轮班抬着三百多斤重的发电机，飞快地走着。电影放映队同志说：“同志们累了歇歇吧！”他们兴致勃勃地回答：“不累，听说看电影，劲头就来了。”走了三十里路，他们真的一点也不累。
    费县是个山区，山又高又多。这里主要的运输工具是小毛驴，很少有路可以推小车，马车更不能通行。柱子山、莲山、梁山、蒙山、真是山峰罗列，悬崖陡峭，沟深水急，形势险要。电影队在放映过程中碰到很多困难，这些困难，都在农民支持下被克服了。笨重的发电机和大小机器零件都是农民亲自来抬的。有些山路，咱们空身走，都有些困难，农民们抬着机器，却走的比我们都快。在莲花庄、大邵庄，呵乐庄、石井等地放映时，我们把他们搬运机器的行列，摄了几个镜头，他们说不出的高兴。
    这里看过电影的人很少很少。一听说放电影，有的人爬过几道高山，渡过几道大河，走出三十多里路来看。有的头几天就搬亲戚，叫闺女，好像过春节一样热闹。每场电影的观众都在万人以上，真是人山人海。晚上看完电影，群众都点灯回家，南山上便出现了许多闪烁的灯光。这个地方去年到今年共放映过两次电影，看的人一次比一次多。放映队在这里放映过“陕北牧歌”、“抗美援朝”、“赵一曼”，农民受到了很大的教育。“陕北牧歌”影片的歌子，在各村里都唱开了。
    五莲山区的山比费县更多，费县有四个区还没有用人抬机器，五莲县演了十七场，机器全是用人抬过去的。放映队的同志不仅要走路爬山放电影，还要帮助民工们搬机器。我们到处受到农民的欢迎和欢送。在潮河村放映后，群众依依不舍，不愿我们走开。少年儿童队打着锣鼓，喊着口号，送我们到庄头上，对我们说：“同志！您以后多到俺山里来放电影呀！”
