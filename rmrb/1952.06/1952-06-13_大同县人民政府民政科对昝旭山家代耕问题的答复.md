Datong County People's Government Civil Affairs Department's Reply Regarding the Zan Xushan Family's Substitute Farming Issue

To the Editor:

The People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column on May 14 published a reader's letter pointing out that cadres in Beicun Village, Datong County, should correct their erroneous attitude towards preferential treatment work. After reading this letter, we immediately sent personnel, together with cadres from the district, to the village for inspection.

Zan Xushan's sister from Beicun Village is already married. He only has his mother at home, with six mu and three fen of irrigated land, with an annual yield of nine shi and eight dou, which can sustain their life by renting it out or hiring people to farm it. According to our province's substitute farming regulations, such a situation should not be entirely substitute farmed (it was entirely substitute farmed last year). This year, because the district civil affairs committee member Cao Shenghua misunderstood the situation, mistakenly believing that Zan Xushan was on a salary system, the district people's government decided not to provide substitute farming for Zan Xushan's land when assessing substitute farming. After the military unit sent a letter to the district people's government, Beicun has re-evaluated the situation democratically, granting Zan Xushan's family twelve workdays of substitute farming (equivalent to seventy-two jin of millet, which has been received by Zan Xushan's mother). In January, the local people's government had already issued Zan Xushan's mother fifty jin of corn as relief grain, and on May 4th, another fifty jin of preferential military grain was issued. Zan Xushan's family's life is not difficult. Cao Shenghua and other relevant cadres have successively made profound self-criticisms for the mistakes they made. In general, our inspection work on preferential treatment work is still not good enough, we should sincerely accept the criticism and strive to improve this work. We also ask you to convey to Comrade Zan Xushan to rest assured and work hard; even if the family has difficulties, the people's government and the broad masses of the people will certainly solve them.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    大同县人民政府民政科对昝旭山家代耕问题的答复
    编辑同志：五月十四日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了读者来信，指出大同县北村干部应该纠正对待优抚工作的错误态度。我们看了这封信以后，立即派员协同该区干部，前往该村作了检查。
    北村昝旭山同志的妹妹早已结婚。他家中只有母亲一人，有水地六亩三分，常年产量是九石八斗，出租或雇人耕种，都可以维持生活。按我省代耕条例，像这样的情形即不应全部代耕（去年是全部代耕了的）。今年，由于区民政委员曹生花把情况了解错了，误以为昝旭山是薪金制待遇，所以区人民政府评定代耕时，曾决定对昝旭山家的地，不再代耕。部队方面给区人民政府来信以后，北村已经重新民主评定，给予昝旭山家代耕人工十二个（折合小米七十二斤，已由昝旭山的母亲领回）。一月里，当地人民政府曾经发给昝旭山母亲救济粮五十斤玉米，五月四日又发给优军粮五十斤。昝旭山家的生活是不困难的。曹生花等有关干部，对他们犯的错误已经先后作了深刻的检讨。总的来说，我们对优抚工作的检查工作还做得不够，我们当诚恳接受批评，努力改进这一工作。我们并请你们转告昝旭山同志，尽可安心工作；即使家庭有困难，人民政府和广大人民也定会解决的。
