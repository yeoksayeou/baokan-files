Chaahar Province's Preferential Treatment and Farming Assistance Work This Spring

The people of Chaahar Province, after ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, have shown an unprecedented surge in patriotic enthusiasm, actively responding to and implementing the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to do a good job in preferential treatment work. In 1951, despite the province facing a severe disaster situation, the farming assistance work ensured that the yields on assisted land were basically no lower than those of ordinary people's land, and in some cases, even exceeded them. This year, during the drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing campaign, the Chaahar Provincial People's Government issued instructions to "conscientiously do a good job in farming assistance work to ensure timely planting of the land of revolutionary martyrs' and military families." A wave of preferential treatment and farming assistance has been set off throughout the province.

During the spring plowing, various areas in Chaahar first addressed the difficulties faced by the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in harrowing, grinding, constructing water conservancy facilities, and lacking fertilizer and seeds, to ensure that their land was planted in a timely manner. In the Chabei Special District, the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel was harrowed and ground one to two times. According to incomplete statistics from seventy-one villages in the Seventh District of Yanggao County, Yanbei Special District, the masses helped more than 800 families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel haul ice and divert water to accumulate on 1,483 mu of land. In addition to helping families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel dig eighteen wells and giving priority to lending four waterwheels in the Eighth District, six villages also exchanged more than twelve shi of high-quality seeds for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, solving their seed problems and ensuring timely planting.

In order to increase the unit area yield of land belonging to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, various areas have universally launched a campaign to donate a basket of manure to them. According to statistics from the Chabei Special District in April, the entire district donated more than 610,000 baskets of manure (equivalent to more than 21,800 large carts) to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. On average, each mu of land belonging to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel was fertilized with two carts of manure. Not only was the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area higher than that of ordinary people, but the total land area fertilized was also 30% higher. In the Shanzhang Village, Third District of Wanquan County, Chanan Special District, the masses successively donated more than 130 baskets of manure to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and put forward the slogan that "each mu of land belonging to each family of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should have one more cart of manure than our own land." The Chabei Special District generally requires that the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should increase production by ten jin of grain per mu this year; each county should have a model village for farming assistance, and the yield of assisted land should reach the level of the high-yield households or production teams in the village. Wei Wanren, a model farming assistant in Kangleng Village, Shangyi County, plans to make the yam land he assists for military families this year produce 1,000 jin more per mu than last year. The Chanan Special District also specifically bought 300,000 jin of dried manure for poor families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who lacked fertilizer. The He Shibao mutual aid team in Chengguan Town, Yanggao County, Yanbei Special District, contracted the land of military family Hou You. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, they transformed two or three mu of grassland into paddy fields. The contracting households in the Sixth District generally proposed: to guarantee that each family of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel receiving farming assistance has a large mu of high-yield crops.

In the distribution of relief grain, cloth, and cotton, the spirit of giving priority to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel was also implemented. In Shanyin County, 60% of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel received spring relief grain. In the Third District of Kangbao County, each of the 173 families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with livelihood difficulties received an average of more than 150 jin more relief grain than ordinary people with the same economic conditions. Thirty-six military families received 3,000 jin of seed grain loans. In Guangling County, 1,413 people received relief cloth and cotton, accounting for 14% of the total population of the county. 2,476 family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel received relief cloth and cotton, accounting for 37% of the total family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Moreover, the number of relief supplies received by families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel was greater than that of the masses.

While distributing relief grain, the Chaahar Provincial People's Government allocated 3.6 million jin of preferential treatment subsidies for the first half of this year to various places for centralized distribution at one time, which better solved the livelihood and production difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and improved their production capacity.

Respecting and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel has become a social ethos. Nine representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in Kangbao County and six representatives in Guangling County participated in the County People's Representative Conference. In Kangbao County, two representatives of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel were elected as members of the Standing Committee. In addition, Guangling County found jobs for four unemployed family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and disabled revolutionary soldiers. The Zhang Baoshan Animal Husbandry Cooperative in Yuxian County stipulated that the breeding fees for livestock belonging to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel would be reduced by half. The Chengguan District of Zhangbei County assisted families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in production, with six military families participating in the liquor store and four military families participating in the work of the stamp tax general sales station. Military family Wang Fu said, "Without the government's care, how could I have today's happy life!"

    察哈尔省今春的优抚代耕工作
    察哈尔省人民经过抗美援朝的思想教育，爱国热情空前高涨，积极响应和贯彻了中国人民抗美援朝总会关于作好优抚工作的号召。一九五一年的代耕工作，在全省灾情十分严重的情况下，作到了代耕土地基本上不低于一般群众土地产量，有的甚至超过。今年在防旱、抗旱、春耕运动中，察哈尔省人民政府又发出了“认真作好代耕工作，保证烈、军属土地适时播种”的指示，全省普遍掀起了优属代耕的热潮。
    在春耕中，察哈尔各地首先解决烈属、军属耙地，磨地，兴修水利和缺乏肥料、种籽等困难，以保证烈属、军属的土地及时播种。察北专区烈属、军属的土地都耙、磨过一至二遍。据雁北专区阳高县七区七十一个村的不完全统计，群众共帮助八百多户烈属、军属背冰、引水汇地达一千四百八十三亩；八区除帮助烈属、军属打井十八眼并优先贷给水车四辆外，其中六个村还给烈属、军属调换优良种籽十二石多，解决了烈属、军属的种籽问题，保证了适时播种。
    为了提高烈属、军属土地的单位面积产量，各地普遍开展了给烈属、军属捐献一筐粪的运动。据察北专区四月份统计，全区共给烈属、军属献粪六十一万多筐（合两万一千八百多大车）。全区烈属、军属的土地，平均每亩都施肥两车。不只单位面积施肥量高于一般群众，而且总土地面积施肥量也高于群众百分之三十。察南专区万全县三区膳房村群众先后给烈属、军属献粪一百三十多筐，并提出要使“每户烈属、军属的每亩地比自家地要多上一车粪”的口号。察北专区今年普遍要求作到烈属、军属的土地每亩增产十市斤粮食；每县要有一个代耕模范村，代耕地的产量要达到本村丰产户或丰产组的土地产量。尚义县康塄村代耕模范魏万仁，计划要使今年给军属代耕的山药地，每亩比去年多产一千斤。察南专区还专门给土地缺肥的贫苦烈属、军属买了三十万斤大粪干。雁北专区阳高县城关镇何世保互助组包耕了军属侯有的土地，为了使这些土地得到丰收，他们把二、三亩草地变成了水田。六区包耕户普遍提出：保证使享受代耕的烈属、军属每户都有一大亩丰产作物。
    各地在发放救济粮和救济布、棉时，也都贯彻了优先照顾烈属、军属的精神。山阴县烈属、军属有百分之六十得到了春季救济粮。康保县三区一百七十三户生活困难的烈属、军属，和具有同等经济条件的一般群众比较，每户平均优先得到救济粮一百五十多斤；有三十六户军属得到种籽贷粮三千斤。广灵县群众得到布、棉救济的有一千四百一十三人，占全县人口总数的百分之十四。烈属、军属得到布、棉救济的有两千四百七十六人，占烈属、军属人口总数的百分之三十七；而且烈属、军属得到救济的物资数多于群众。
    和发放救济粮同时，察哈尔省人民政府把今年上半年的优抚补助粮三百六十万斤，拨交各地一次集中发下，这就更好地给烈属、军属解决了生活、生产困难，提高了他们的生产能力。
    尊敬和优待烈属、军属已形成一种社会风气。康保县有烈属、军属代表九人、广灵县有代表六人都参加了县各界人民代表会议。康保县烈属、军属代表中并有两人当选为常务委员。此外，广灵县给四个没有职业的烈属、军属和革命残废军人找到了职业。蔚县张宝山种畜合作社规定烈属、军属的牲口配种减半收费。张北县城关区扶助烈属、军属生产，有六户军属参加了销酒店、四户军属参加了发票印花总售站的工作。军属王福说：“要没有政府的照顾，我哪能有今天的幸福生活！”
