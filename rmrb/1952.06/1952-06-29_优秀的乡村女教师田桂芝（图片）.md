    (19) The General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued three major appeals. The villagers of Yongsheng Tun wanted to use practical actions to defend the motherland and their happy lives. The donation plan made according to the actual situation was incorporated into the patriotic pact. The children also shoveled eight *mu* of land, earning 800,000 yuan, all of which was donated. Yongsheng Tun completed its donation plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.
    (20) The People's Government called for increased production and thrift, and increased yield per unit area. Tian Guizhi cooperated with the Farmers' Association, conducting educational work through peasant night schools; mobilizing everyone to form mutual aid production teams, apply more manure, and cultivate carefully. Everyone said: "A bumper harvest is not a problem, Chairman Mao's leadership is truly great." "Teacher Tian helped us set up mutual aid teams, and our confidence is even higher."
    (21) Tian Guizhi carried out the task given to her by the Party, running the school well with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, and was loved by the masses. In recent years, she has been continuously selected as a model worker in winter literacy programs, a model member of the Communist Youth League, a model propagandist, and a model teacher, setting a good example for young people across the country.
