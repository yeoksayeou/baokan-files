Strengthening Economic Construction on the Basis of the Victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements
    Liu Lantao
    Editor's Note: The North China Regional Committee for Checking on Economy held a meeting on June 17. According to the "Instructions on Several Issues Concerning the Conclusion of the 'Five-Anti' Movement" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the previous instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the meeting examined the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" Movement in all counties and above in the region and the "Five-Anti" Movement in fourteen large and medium-sized cities. The participants unanimously agreed that the State Council's instruction was very timely and correct, and fully conformed to the actual situation in North China. They expressed their warm support and believed that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements in North China had achieved great success. In the future, all efforts should be focused on strengthening various construction tasks centered on economic construction on the basis of this victory. The meeting was concluded by Liu Lantao, director of the North China Regional Committee for Checking on Economy. The following is a summary of the conclusion.

    The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, which lasted about half a year, were a massive mass revolution in politics, economy, ideology, social customs, and other aspects. Thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the joint efforts of all party, government, military, civilian, and academic personnel, the vast number of workers, and people of all strata in the region, the movement has now come to a victorious conclusion. This is another great victory of historical significance for the people of North China on their path forward.

    In terms of the "Three-Anti" Movement, more than one million people from party, government, military, civilian, academic, and industrial and mining enterprises above the county level in the North China region directly participated in the movement. The entire movement consisted of roughly five interconnected and intertwined stages: (1) universal inspection of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; (2) several "tiger" fighting campaigns; (3) evidence gathering, recovery of stolen goods, and case determination; (4) clarification of relationships and demarcation of boundaries; (5) democratic remedial lessons and formulation of systems. After the "tiger" fighting, various industrial and mining enterprises also prominently carried out a period of anti-waste struggle. During or after the "Three-Anti" Movement, party congresses or representative meetings were generally convened, while representative meetings and congresses of staff and workers were held in general organs and factories to vigorously consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement ideologically, politically, and organizationally.

    This movement resolutely countered the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements against the Communist Party, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, and the people's organizations. With the full participation of the broad masses, leading organs at all levels investigated and cleared out a large number of corrupt elements, cleared and corrected extravagant and wasteful behavior, and implemented the policy of "combining strictness with leniency, combining transformation with punishment." In addition to severely punishing a small number of major corrupt elements who committed serious crimes and did not know how to repent, the vast majority were treated leniently, so that they could be educated and have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. Through this struggle, not only were all those who had committed corruption errors saved, but all state personnel were universally given the most practical and profound education. The ideas that "corruption is a crime" and "waste is shameful" have taken root in people's hearts, and a powerful force of mass resistance to the "three evils" has been formed. Hard work and frugality, honesty in public service, cherishing public property, and serving the people wholeheartedly have become the most noble moral concepts and codes of conduct. Bureaucratic errors have been severely criticized, thus highly promoting the enthusiasm of the masses and greatly improving the relationship between superiors and subordinates, between the party and the government, and between the people and the masses, raising the political awareness and work enthusiasm of cadres and people of all strata. In the situation of few people and many affairs, the work efficiency of organs has doubled, new records and new creations in industrial and agricultural production have appeared everywhere, and excellent activists have emerged from the masses in their thousands, enhancing the belief and enthusiasm for building a great motherland a hundredfold. People clearly see that the evil wind of embezzlement and theft—a deeply rooted poison left over from history—can only be completely eliminated by the working class and its political party—the Communist Party and the People's Government. This also fully demonstrates the superiority of the New Democracy system. The prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the people has been greatly enhanced. The masses believe that this is "the happiest event that has never happened since the beginning of the world." They are convinced that "the Party, the government, and the army led by Chairman Mao will never be corrupt" and "will definitely consolidate the victory and move towards socialism." Our responsibility is to protect and develop various newborn forces and the precious revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, so that they become a powerful force for building the motherland. It is wrong for anyone to be confused by certain temporary or secondary phenomena and attempt to dilute or inappropriately estimate the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement. We should help people with erroneous understandings to gain correct understandings.

    In terms of the "Five-Anti" Movement, it was vigorously carried out in fourteen large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Xinxiang, and Guihua, and it also achieved great results. In these cities, more than 500,000 employees and shop assistants participated in the "Five-Anti" Movement, and more than 100,000 industrial and commercial households were educated in the movement and acknowledged the justice and necessity of the movement.

    The "Five-Anti" Movement was a great social reform movement to change customs and habits. The purpose was to eliminate the "five poisons" and correct the illegal behaviors of industrial and commercial households, so that they would obediently submit to the leadership of the state-owned economy, abide by the Common Program, and engage in production and business that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and not for other purposes. In particular, after carrying out serious struggles, in order to effectively achieve the goal of "being conducive to eliminating the 'five poisons' of industrialists and businessmen, and also conducive to uniting industrialists and businessmen to develop production and business," each city seriously, earnestly, and pragmatically carried out tasks such as classification, verification, case determination, and decision on refunding money and paying taxes according to the principle of "strict in struggle, lenient in handling; strict for those who should be strict, lenient for those who should be lenient." The industrialists and businessmen were all grateful to the People's Government and the working class for their leniency, believing that this was "leniency that they never dreamed of," "the government sincerely transforms us and wants us to learn well," "'Five-Anti' is like attending a university and entering a hospital, and the sores and poisons on the body are cured," "sad faces turn into happy faces," and their interest and enthusiasm in management are thus improved. The facts also powerfully debunked all rumors and dispelled some unnecessary misunderstandings that occurred temporarily. The relationship between the bourgeoisie and the state is much more normal than before the "Five-Anti" Movement.

    The broad masses of employees, shop assistants, and people of all strata in the city enthusiastically participated in the "Five-Anti" Movement. About 90% of the employees and shop assistants in private factories and shops participated in the struggle. They received practical training in the struggle and drew a line between themselves and the bourgeoisie. The consciousness of the working class as masters was greatly improved. Many employees and shop assistants joined the trade union, and the organization of the working class—the trade union—has greatly developed and consolidated. This further established the leadership of the working class politically and ideologically, which is extremely important for developing production, prospering the economy, building cities, and preventing illegal bourgeois elements from applying the "five poisons" again in the future. Due to the increased awareness of the broad working class of employees and shop assistants, the bourgeoisie has been educated, making the relationship between public and private, and the relationship between labor and capital built on a brand-new foundation, creating favorable conditions for developing production and strengthening unity. The positive results of the "Five-Anti" Movement can now be clearly seen. Due to the unprecedented rise in employees' production enthusiasm and the establishment of a new labor-capital relationship, the production volume of some private factories and mines has increased by an average of 20% to 100%, while the cost has decreased by an average of 30% to 40%, and the quality of products has generally improved. The turnover of legitimate private stores is increasing day by day, many bad habits in private industry and commerce have been eliminated, and the people in urban and rural areas feel convenient.

    Now, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, as movements, have come to a victorious conclusion. A common result of the "Five-Anti" and "Three-Anti" Movements is that the prices of more than 4,000 commodities in North China have decreased by an average of about 5%. This benefit is only the beginning, and its impact will be much more far-reaching. After removing the "five poisons," industrialists and businessmen do face some difficulties in production and management on the surface, but these are difficulties that can be overcome in the process of advancing towards victory, and the state is also giving reasonable guidance and solutions.

    On the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, our long-term and overriding central task in the future is to strengthen industrial and agricultural production and invigorate urban-rural exchanges and other economic construction tasks with all our strength. All other work must be subordinated to and serve this overall task. At present, the high tide of industrial and agricultural production in North China has already begun. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has decided to increase production and save 4 trillion yuan in state-owned and public factories, mines, and enterprises in the next six months. In order to realize this combat task, it is necessary to immediately organize a patriotic production increase and economy campaign with party members and members of the Communist Youth League as the backbone and the participation of the broad masses of workers. The North China Administrative Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government recently convened a special meeting to make specific plans and arrangements for the campaign. It is estimated that more than one million employees will participate in this campaign, and the campaign will continue until the end of the year. In order to sum up experience and arrange next year's production, it is planned to convene a North China Regional Labor Model Representative Meeting in December this year. The industrial production competition campaign is a major event related to our fundamental interests. In this production reform and political reform in state-owned and public factories and mines, many backward things will be eliminated, countless new creations and new heroic deeds will emerge, and major changes will also take place in people's thinking. The results of the competition will be of great significance for enhancing the country's economic and defense strength, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, strengthening the unity within the people, and enhancing the leading role of the working class. All Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models, trade union members, and all employees in various factories and mines should devote themselves to the campaign and strive to complete this glorious political task.

    The regional agricultural patriotic production increase movement has been widely launched and has achieved remarkable results: the mutual aid and cooperation movement has developed unprecedentedly, technical leadership has been greatly strengthened, and the area of waterlogged land will be increased from 11% of the cultivated land last year to 19%. The old liberated areas will gradually and systematically develop long-term construction. The overall task of agricultural production this year is to continue to strengthen the above-mentioned work, to further promote and develop the agricultural patriotic production increase movement, and to strive to exceed the pre-war total agricultural output by 1.2 billion jin of millet and 3.8 million dan of cotton.

    The exchange of materials between urban and rural areas is rapidly recovering and developing. The North China Materials Exchange Conference held in April and May has played a certain role in invigorating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. We have decided to hold another materials exchange conference this autumn. In order to adapt to the ever-developing industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, all localities must attach importance to trade work in urban and rural areas and cooperative work, and further strengthen organization and leadership, especially to accept the lessons of the "Three-Anti" Movement and greatly strengthen political and ideological leadership over trade work and cooperative work. At the same time, correctly lead private trade to make it subordinate to the needs of national construction.

    In order to complete the above-mentioned construction tasks, it is necessary to promote, cultivate, and train cadres in large numbers to prepare the necessary talents for national construction. All localities should make plans for this and gradually implement them. All conservative views must be opposed on this issue. For the large number of outstanding elements who have grown up in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements and the production competition movement and meet the conditions for party membership, the party committees of all localities should plan and prepare to absorb them into the party in accordance with the party constitution. All cadres must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, especially grasp the organization of the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," in order to organize a study upsurge at the same time as the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, so as to generally improve the level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among cadres, better work for the party and the people, and strive for the country's industrialization.

    In the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, all cadres and the broad masses of people have received great training and learned many valuable experiences. In the future, we should continue to carry forward our achievements, overcome shortcomings and mistakes, and strive to better complete the various tasks assigned to us by the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government under the leadership of the great and wise leader Chairman Mao!

    在“三反”“五反”运动胜利基础上加强经济建设工作
    刘澜涛
    编者按：华北区节约检查委员会于六月十七日召开会议，根据中央人民政府政务院“关于结束‘五反’运动中几个问题的指示”及中国共产党中央委员会和中央人民政府关于“三反”、“五反”运动的历次指示，检查了全区县以上“三反”运动和十四个大中城市“五反”运动胜利结束的情况。与会者一致认为政务院这一指示是非常适时、非常正确的，完全符合华北区的实际情况，表示热烈拥护；并认为华北区的“三反”、“五反”运动，业已获得伟大成绩，今后应在这一胜利的基础之上，集中全力加强以经济建设为中心的各项建设工作。会议由华北区节约检查委员会主任刘澜涛做了结论。下面是这个结论的摘要。
    历时半年左右的伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动，是一个巨大的政治、经济、思想和社会风尚等各方面的群众性的大革命。由于毛主席的英明领导和全区党、政、军、民、学各方面工作人员、广大职工以及各阶层人民的共同努力，现在运动已胜利地结束了。这是华北人民在自己前进道路上所获得的又一次伟大的具有历史意义的胜利。
    在“三反”运动方面，华北区县以上党、政、军、民、学及工矿企业各系统直接参加运动的共达百余万人。整个运动大体由五个相互衔接、相互交错的阶段所组成，即：（一）普遍检查贪污、浪费和官僚主义；（二）若干个打“虎”战役；（三）对证追赃、定案处理；（四）交关系、划界限；（五）民主补课和制订制度。各工矿企业在打“虎”之后，还突出地进行了一段反浪费斗争。在“三反”运动的过程中或结束后，普遍召开党的代表大会或代表会议，在一般机关厂矿中则召开工作人员或职工的代表会议和代表大会，从思想上、政治上、组织上有力地巩固了“三反”运动的成果。
    这次运动坚决地反击了不法资产阶级分子对共产党、人民政府、人民解放军和人民团体的猖狂进攻，各级领导机关在广大群众的全力参与下，清查出大批贪污分子，清算和纠正了铺张浪费的行为，并根据“严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合”的方针，除对少数罪恶严重、不知悔罪的大贪污犯予以严惩以外，对于绝大多数则实行宽大处理，使之既能得到教育，又有改过自新的机会。经过这场斗争，不仅使所有犯贪污错误的人得到挽救，而且使一切国家工作人员都普遍地受到一次最实际最深刻的教育，“贪污有罪”“浪费可耻”的思想深入人心，群众性的抵制“三害”的强大力量形成了。艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公、爱护公共财物、全心全意为人民服务，成为人们最高尚的道德观念和行动准则。官僚主义错误，受到严厉的批判，因而高度发扬了群众的积极性，极大地改善了上下级之间，党、政府与人民群众之间的关系，提高了干部和各阶层人民的政治觉悟和工作热情。在人少事繁的情况下，机关工作效率却一倍两倍地提高了；工农业生产中的新纪录、新创造到处出现，优秀的积极分子成千上万地从群众中涌现出来，建设伟大祖国的信念与热情百倍地增强了。人们清楚地看到：贪污盗窃之风——这一历史上遗留下来的根深蒂固的污毒，只有工人阶级及其政党——共产党和人民政府才能予以彻底的清除。这也充分证明了新民主主义制度的优越性。党和人民政府在人民群众中的威信极大地提高了，群众认为这是“开天辟地以来从未有过的快事”。他们确信“毛主席领导的党、政府和军队，永远不会腐化”，“一定能巩固胜利，走向社会主义”。我们的责任是保护并发展各种新生的力量和群众宝贵的革命热情，使之成为强大的建设祖国的力量。一切为某些暂时的或次要的现象所迷惑，企图冲淡或不恰当地估计“三反”运动的伟大成果，都是不对的。我们应当帮助有错误认识的人们得到正确认识。
    在“五反”运动方面，北京、天津、太原、唐山、保定、张家口、新乡、归绥等十四个大中城市轰轰烈烈地进行了，同样取得了伟大的成绩。在这些城市中，参加“五反”运动的职工和店员达五十万余人，有十余万工商户在运动中受到了教育，承认了此次运动的正义性和必要性。
    “五反”运动是一次伟大的移风易俗的社会改革运动，目的是为了清除“五毒”，纠正工商业户的违法行为，使之规规矩矩服从国营经济的领导，遵守共同纲领，从事有益于国计民生的生产和经营，而不是为了其他。特别是各城市在进行了严肃的斗争之后，为切实达到“既有利于清除工商业者的‘五毒’，又有利于团结工商业者发展生产和营业”的目的，根据“斗争从严，处理从宽；应当严者严之，应当宽者宽之”的原则，严肃认真、实事求是地进行了分类、核实定案、决定退财补税等项工作。工商业者，都一致感激人民政府和工人阶级对他们的宽大，认为这是“做梦也想不到的宽大”，“政府真心改造我们，要我们学好”，“‘五反’等于上了一次大学，进了一次医院，满身的疮毒治好了”，“愁眉苦脸变成喜眉笑脸”，经营的兴趣和积极性因此提高。事实也有力地揭穿了一切谣言，解消了暂时发生的若干不必要的误解。资产阶级和国家的关系较之“五反”运动以前正常的多了。
    广大职工店员和城市各阶层人民热烈地参加了“五反”运动，私营厂店的职工店员约有百分之九十参加了斗争。他们在斗争中受到实际锻炼，和资产阶级划清了界限，工人阶级主人翁的自觉性大大提高。许多职工店员加入了工会，工人阶级的组织——工会大大发展和巩固了。这就从政治上、思想上进一步确立了工人阶级的领导，对于今后发展生产、繁荣经济、建设城市以及防止不法资产阶级分子再施“五毒”等方面，都是极关重要的。由于广大工人店员阶级觉悟的提高，资产阶级受到了教育，使公私关系、劳资关系建筑在一个崭新的基础上，为发展生产、加强团结创造了有利条件。“五反”运动的积极结果，现在已经可以明显地看出来，由于职工生产热情的空前高涨和新的劳资关系的建立，有的私营厂矿的生产量平均提高百分之二十到一倍，成本则平均降低百分之三十至四十左右，生产品的质量普遍提高；正当私营商店的营业额逐日上升，私营工商业中的许多陋习去掉了，城乡人民都感到方便。
    现在，“三反”、“五反”作为一个运动来说，已经胜利结束了。“五反”、“三反”运动的一个共同结果，就是华北有四千余种商品价格平均降低了百分之五左右，这种好处目前只是开始，其影响还要深远得多。工商业者在去掉“五毒”之后，生产经营在表面上看确是存在着一些困难的，但这是在向胜利前进中可以克服的困难，国家也正在予以合理的指导和解决。
    在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，我们今后长期的也是压倒一切的中心任务，就是全力加强工农业生产和活跃城乡交流等各项经济建设工作，其他一切工作必须服从和服务于这个总任务。目前华北区工农业生产的高潮已经开始。中共中央华北局决定在今后半年内在国营和公营的工厂、矿山、企业内增产节约人民币四万亿元。为实现这一战斗任务，必须立即组织以党员、团员为骨干、有广大职工参加的爱国增产节约竞赛运动。中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会最近已召开了专门会议，对竞赛运动作了具体计划和布置。这个竞赛运动，预计将有百万以上职工参加，运动将一直持续到年底。为了总结经验，布置明年的生产，准备在今年十二月份内召开华北区劳动模范代表会议。工业生产竞赛运动，是和我们的根本利益有关的一件大事，在国营和公营厂矿企业的这次生产改革和政治改革中，将打掉许许多多落后的东西，涌现无数新的创造、新的英雄事迹，而在人们的思想上也将发生重大变化。竞赛的结果，对于增强国家经济力量和国防力量，巩固工农联盟，加强人民内部的团结，提高工人阶级的领导作用，都将有极重要的意义。各厂矿企业中的所有共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范、工会会员以及全体职工，都应全力投入运动，为完成这一光荣的政治任务而奋斗。
    全区农业爱国增产运动已广泛展开，并已获得显著成绩：互助合作运动空前发展，技术领导大大加强，水地面积将由去年的占耕地面积的百分之十一提高到百分之十九，老区将有计划地长期建设逐步展开。今年农业生产上的总任务就是在继续加强上述工作中，在进一步推广与发展农业爱国增产运动中，为超过战前农业总产量十二亿斤小米和三百八十万担棉花而奋斗。
    城乡物资交流工作正在迅速恢复和发展。四、五月间召开的华北物资交流大会对于活跃城乡物资交流已经起了一定的作用，我们决定今年秋后再开一次物资交流大会。为了适应日益发展的工农业生产和广大城乡人民的需要，各地必须重视城乡贸易工作和合作社工作，进一步加强组织和领导，尤须接受“三反”的教训，十分加强对贸易工作和合作社工作的政治思想领导；同时正确地领导私人贸易，使之服从国家建设的需要。
    为了完成以上各项建设任务，必须大批地提拔、培养和训练干部，为国家建设准备必需的人材。各地都应做出此项计划，逐步实施，在这个问题上必须反对一切保守观点。对于在“三反”“五反”运动与生产竞赛运动中生长出来的大批够党员条件的优秀分子，各地党委应当有计划有准备地按照党章分别吸收他们到党内来。全体干部则必须加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，特别抓紧组织“实践论”和“矛盾论”的学习，以便在工农业生产高潮的同时，组织一个学习的热潮，以普遍提高干部中的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的水平，更好地为党为人民工作，为国家的工业化而努力。
    在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动中，全体干部和广大人民群众，都受到了极大的锻炼，学到很多宝贵的经验。今后应继续发扬成绩，克服缺点和错误，在伟大英明的领袖毛主席领导下，为更好地完成党中央和中央人民政府给予我们的各项任务而奋斗！
