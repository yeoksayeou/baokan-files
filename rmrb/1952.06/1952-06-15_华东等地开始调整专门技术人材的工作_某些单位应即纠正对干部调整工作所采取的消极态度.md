[News from this newspaper] Since this newspaper published readers' letters and brief comments on the rational use of specialized technical personnel on May 19, it has aroused great attention from many units across the country. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Personnel Bureau convened a meeting of personnel section chiefs of its subordinate units the next day to mobilize them, began investigating and registering technical personnel, and prepared to adjust cadres. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also conducted an investigation and prepared to transfer forty specialized technical personnel from units under the East China Bureau to the most needed posts in economic construction. Currently, fifteen people have been transferred. The East China Bureau also transferred nineteen people with certain specialized skills from northern Anhui who had been retained locally to participate in land reform to participate in economic construction. The Personnel Department of the East China Military and Political Committee has prepared forms and is ready to conduct unified registration in the East China region to rationally use technical personnel. The department also instructed the East China Industrial Department to make reasonable adjustments to the work of five university graduates at the Shenchang Machinery Factory. Among these five people, some studied electrical engineering and some studied mechanical engineering; however, they were assigned to do work such as receiving and dispatching, statistics, copying, and managing attendance cards. The Chemical Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry also specifically studied the issue of rationally using technical personnel and prepared to transfer specialized technical personnel who should not remain in the unit to factories and basic construction departments. The Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government is preparing to make appropriate adjustments to the work of eleven science and engineering university students in the department. The department also specifically organized three groups to go deep into the Coal Mine Administration, the Electric Power Engineering Administration, and the Machinery Bureau to investigate and study the use of specialized technical personnel.

However, many leading cadres in some departments still have not given due attention to the important issue of rationally using talent. For example, among the staff of the East China Education Department, thirty-nine are university graduates. According to research by the East China Personnel Department, it is believed that sixteen of them are "not using what they have learned" and need to be adjusted. However, only five people have been transferred so far. The East China Education Department unilaterally emphasizes "work needs" for the remaining eleven people and refuses to transfer them. Among these eleven people, some graduated from the Department of Chemistry and are now working as personnel secretaries; some graduated from the Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology and are now reviewing the literature and history courses of various schools.

Some agencies that manage cadre work still hold a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the issue of rationally using specialized technical personnel. For example, the Central Ministry of Trade currently has fifteen university graduates in science and engineering, and their current work is handling contract documents, reviewing specifications, and importing equipment and other trade administrative affairs. Ten months ago, the Central Personnel Department raised the issue of considering the job adjustment of these cadres to the Personnel Department of the ministry, but the department emphasized "business needs" and demanded "if you want to adjust, bring people to exchange." Later, most of the students assigned to the Central Ministry of Trade constantly raised opinions due to the inconsistency between what they studied and what they did. The Central Personnel Department also sent people to the Personnel Department of the ministry several times to understand the situation, but until now, the person in charge of the department has neither considered the issue of specialized talent adjustment nor understood the specific work situation of these fifteen people. The Personnel Department of the Central Ministry of Trade should conduct a serious inspection and quickly correct this unreasonable phenomenon.

### 华东等地开始调整专门技术人材的工作  某些单位应即纠正对干部调整工作所采取的消极态度

    华东等地开始调整专门技术人材的工作
    某些单位应即纠正对干部调整工作所采取的消极态度
    【本报讯】本报五月十九日发表关于合理使用专门技术人材的读者来信及简评后，已引起各地不少单位的重视。北京市人民政府人事局在第二天，就召集了所属各单位的人事科长开会，进行动员，并着手调查登记技术人材，准备进行干部调整。中共中央华东局也作了调查，准备将华东局所属单位中四十名专门技术人材，调到经济建设最需要的岗位上去，目前已有十五人调出。华东局并从皖北调回因参加土地改革而被留在当地工作、具有一定专门技术的人员十九人参加经济建设工作。华东军政委员会人事部已制好表格，准备在华东区统一进行登记，以便合理使用技术人材。该部并责成华东工业部将所属慎昌机械厂的五个大学毕业生的工作，作了合理的调整。这五人中有学电机的、有学机械的；但却被分配做收发、统计、抄写、管理考勤卡片等工作。中央重工业部化学工业局也具体研究了合理使用技术人材的问题，准备将不应留在本单位的专门技术人材调到工厂和基本建设部门去。东北人民政府人事部准备将本部十一个学理工的大学生的工作作适当调整。该部并专门组织了三个小组，分别深入煤矿管理局、电业工程管理局、机器局，调查和研究专门技术人材的使用情况。
    但是，还有不少部门的领导干部，至今对于合理使用人材这个重要问题，还未加以应有的重视。例如华东教育部工作人员中，有三十九名是高等学校毕业生，据华东人事部研究，认为其中有十六人是“学非所用”，需要调整。但至今只调出五人，华东教育部对其余十一人则片面强调“工作需要”，不肯调出。这十一人中，有的是化学系毕业，现做人事秘书；有的是植物病虫害系毕业，现做审查各校文史课程工作。
    有些管理干部工作的机关，对合理使用专门技术人材这个问题，仍然抱着漠不关心的官僚主义态度。如中央贸易部现有十五个高等学校理工科毕业生，他们现在的工作是办理合同公文、审查规格、器材进口等贸易行政事务。十个月以前，中央人事部曾向该部人事司提出考虑这些干部的工作调整问题，但该司却强调“业务需要”，并提出“如果要调整，就拿人来换”的要求。以后，分配到中央贸易部的学生，大部分因学用不一致而不断提出意见，中央人事部也几次派人到该部人事司去了解情况，但直到现在，该司负责人既没有考虑专门人材调整问题，也不了解这十五个人的具体工作情况。中央贸易部人事司应认真进行检查，并迅速纠正这种不合理的现象。
