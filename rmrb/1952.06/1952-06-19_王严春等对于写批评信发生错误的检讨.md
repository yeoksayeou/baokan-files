Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Wang Yanchun and Others' Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in Writing a Letter of Criticism
    To the Editors: After receiving your letter, we exchanged views with some comrades in our department (Tianjin Municipal People's Government News and Publication Department) separately, and held a meeting on the 10th of this month with all comrades to discuss our criticism of the department's work. With the enlightenment of leading cadres and the help of all comrades, we finally realized that the letter we wrote criticizing the work of our department (published in the People's Daily readers' letters column on April 13) was erroneous. We are now explaining the situation and making a self-criticism based on the four questions raised in your letter.
    (1) We said in our letter to you that the work of our department had been stagnant for nearly a year, which is wrong. We mistakenly believed that the work of the "North China Regional Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition" and the work of organizing and mobilizing the masses in the "Three-Anti" movement were only the "central temporary tasks" of our department and not our regular business, so we arbitrarily said that the work of our department had been stagnant for nearly a year. Now we realize that these tasks are inseparable from our regular business (and during the execution of central tasks, regular business work was not completely stagnant).
    (2) We overemphasized the matter of the news release section and newspaper reporters grabbing news, which is also wrong.
    (3) We said that the slackness of individual comrades' work was the slackness of the work of the department's staff, which affected the confidence and enthusiasm of the majority of actively working comrades.
    (4) Do the publication management section and the Cultural Bureau and the Artists Association often have disputes? We made an even bigger mistake on this issue. There is no "frequent dispute" between them.
    The main reason for the above errors is that we are one-sided in our view of problems, and our attitude towards writing letters to the Party newspaper is extremely unserious. We did not realize the huge political impact of every word in the Party newspaper among the masses. In the future, we must painfully abandon this irresponsible attitude towards the Party newspaper and the people!  Wang Yanchun, Fu Yueqiu, Chen Zhen

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    王严春等对于写批评信发生错误的检讨
    编辑同志：接到你们的来信以后，我们曾和我处（天津市人民政府新闻出版处）部分同志分别交换意见，并在本月十日和全体同志开会讨论我们对我处工作的批评。经过领导干部的启发和全体同志的帮助，我们终于认识到我们所写批评我处工作的信（载四月十三日人民日报读者来信栏）是犯有错误的。我们现在根据你们来信中所提的四个问题，说明情况，并作出检讨。
    （一）我们曾在给你们的信中说，我处工作已经停顿将近一年，这是错误的。我们错认为“华北区城乡物资交流展览大会”的工作以及“三反”运动中组织动员群众的工作都只是我处的“中心临时任务”，而不算是我处的经常业务，因此武断地说我处工作停顿已将近一年。现在我们认识到这些工作和我处经常业务是不可分割的（而且在执行中心任务期间，经常业务工作亦未全部停顿）。
    （二）我们过分强调了新闻发布科和报社记者抢消息的事，也是错误的。
    （三）我们把个别同志工作松懈说成本处工作人员工作松懈，这就影响了多数积极工作的同志们的信心和热情。
    （四）出版管理科和文化局、美协是否时有争执？在这个问题上，我们所犯的错误更大。他们之间说不上“时有争执”。
    造成以上错误的原因，主要是因为我们看问题有片面性，我们对党报写信的态度极不严肃。我们没有认识到党报上的每一句话在群众中巨大的政治影响。今后我们一定要痛戒这种对党报、对人民不负责任的作风！  王严春  傅越秋  陈珍
