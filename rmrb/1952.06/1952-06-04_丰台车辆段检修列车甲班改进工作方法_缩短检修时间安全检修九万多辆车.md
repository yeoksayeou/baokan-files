    Fengtai Depot Inspection Train Team A Improves Work Methods
    Shortens Inspection Time, Safely Inspects Over 90,000 Vehicles
    The Fengtai Depot Inspection Train Team A of the Tianjin Railway Administration safely inspected over 91,000 vehicles in four months this year, shortened inspection time, and saved the state over 1.23 billion yuan. The main reason this team has achieved such results is that the leading cadres united all the workers, improved work methods, and learned from advanced experiences. The team's inspection director, Liu Qi, is a cadre promoted from among the workers. He cares about the workers' lives and always consults with them on matters. He and the workers jointly studied and changed the shift system to a line-responsibility system, changing the past backward work methods where workers could not attend to everything when inspecting trains, ensuring the smooth progress of train inspection work. Under Liu Qi's leadership, the workers also paid attention to absorbing other people's experiences. They saw that the workers in Team C paid great attention to preparation work before inspecting trains, so they immediately did the same. They saw reports in the newspaper about accidents involving deaths and injuries at the Tianjin Depot, so they held meetings to discuss how to prevent accidents. They decided that before inspecting a train, they would inspect from both ends towards the middle, and insert red flags at both ends, only removing the red flags after the work was done. This ensured the safety of the inspection personnel under the car. Before accepting tasks, they encouraged each other to pay attention to safety. During inspection, they conscientiously implemented a call-and-response system to ensure that no errors occurred in the inspection work. Because of these efforts, they did not have a single accident in four months.
    On April 30th, Soviet experts came to Fengtai to introduce Soviet experience and pointed out that the Fengtai Depot could further shorten inspection operation time. At that time, some people thought: "The equipment conditions are not sufficient, there are not enough people, and now it only takes 50 minutes (it used to take more than an hour) to inspect a train, there is no way to reduce it further." However, Yang Fengming, the leader of this team, took the lead in implementing the experience introduced by the Soviet experts into the work, and as a result, it only took 23 minutes to inspect a train. This fact powerfully illustrates that shortening inspection time is entirely possible. In carrying out the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, the Fengtai Depot Inspection Train Team A will have even greater achievements. (Chen Bingwen)

    丰台车辆段检修列车甲班改进工作方法
    缩短检修时间安全检修九万多辆车
    天津铁路管理局丰台车辆段检修列车甲班，在今年四个月内安全检修了九万一千多辆车，并缩短了检修时间，给国家节省了十二亿三千多万元。这个班所以能有这样的成绩，主要是因为领导干部团结了全体工人，改进了工作方法，学习了先进经验。这个班的检修主任刘启是从工人群众中提拔出来的干部，他关心工人的生活，遇事总和工人商量。他和工人共同研究，把轮班制改成了包线负责制，改变了过去工人检修列车时顾东顾不了西的落后工作方法，保证列车检修工作的顺利进行。在刘启领导下，工人们还注意吸收别人的经验。他们看见丙班的工人在检修列车之前，很注意准备工作，就马上也照这样办。他们在报纸上看见天津车辆段发生死伤事故，就开会讨论，研究如何防止事故。他们决定：在检查一列车以前，他们分别从两端向中间检查，并在两头插上红旗，做完工作之后，才把红旗摘掉。这样在车底下的检修人员的安全就有了保障。在接受任务之前，他们都相互勉励，注意安全。在检修时，认真实行呼唤应答制，保证检修工作不发生错误。由于他们作了这些努力，在四个月内没有发生一件事故。
    四月三十日，苏联专家来到丰台，介绍苏联经验，并指出丰台车辆段还可以缩短检修作业时间。当时有人认为：“设备条件不够，人员不足，现在只用五十分钟（过去要一个多钟头）检修一列车，没法再减少了。”但是，这个班的杨凤鸣带头把苏联专家介绍的经验贯彻到工作中去，结果检修一列车只用了二十三分钟。这一事实有力地说明了缩短检修时间是完全可以的。在开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，丰台车辆段检修列车甲班将会有更多的成就。      （陈秉文）
