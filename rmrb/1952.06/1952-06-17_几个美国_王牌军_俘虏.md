Several U.S. "Ace Army" Prisoners
Li Rui

In a mountain village full of wildflowers on the Kaesong front, I and several young comrades went to see some American prisoners who had just been captured from the front lines.

These American prisoners are all from the 1st Marine Division of the United States. This division has a history of one hundred and seventy-five years and is known as the "Ace Army." In order to add bargaining chips to delay the negotiations, the American invaders specially drew this "ace" from the eastern front to the Kaesong front to replace the positions of the puppet ROK 1st Division. These prisoners are all from the 5th Regiment, and their regimental commander constantly told them: "Maintain the glory of the 1st Marine Division; being captured is the most shameful thing. The 7th Regiment was captured too much on the eastern front. Our 5th Regiment has not been captured much. At least we must maintain the glory of this regiment." However, their soldiers could not maintain it and had no intention of maintaining this "glory."

The simple course of the battle was as follows: On the night of April 16th, a reinforced company of our volunteer army on the Kaesong front launched a surprise attack on the enemy defending Height 190.5. The enemy's positions had several outer defense works, with barbed wire, illuminating mines, and various "modernized" defensive obstacles. However, under the rapid and concentrated artillery bombardment of our volunteer army, the enemy's defense works were destroyed, and our soldiers quickly broke into the position, completely dividing and encircling this company of defenders, killing and wounding seventy or eighty people, and these five were captured alive. The prisoners said, "Your movements were too fast. When we heard the gunshots and ran to the company headquarters, the company headquarters had already been surrounded."

Among these five prisoners, two came over relatively "smoothly." The one who captured them alive was a new soldier of ours who was only eighteen years old. He usually dreamed of performing meritorious service and seeing Chairman Mao, and this time he truly performed meritorious service. The other three struggled desperately when they were captured and refused to come over. The soldiers got angry and carried them down the mountain like pigs. Afterwards, when asked why they were unwilling to come over obediently, they said: "First, in just one more day, it would have been our turn to rotate off. Second, we are from the 1st Marine Division, and being captured is too dishonorable. Third, you didn't shout." Our soldiers had all learned English to shout, but in the past, they were fighting against the puppet ROK army, and they were familiar with the slogans for the puppet ROK army to surrender. The U.S. Marine Corps had just arrived, and the soldiers were nervous when charging and forgot to shout the English surrender slogans. The prisoners said, "If you had shouted, we wouldn't have been so scared."

These five prisoners are all from the 1st Company of the 5th Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. The first is a twenty-year-old Spanish corporal. The second is twenty-four years old, American, and graduated from a vocational school of civil engineering. After graduation, he had not yet found a job and was conscripted into the army. The third is twenty-two years old, originally a civil construction worker, who was forcibly conscripted into the army. The other two are muddle-headed children, one nineteen years old and the other eighteen years old. When they came down from the eastern front, they all thought they were going home for rotation, but as a result, they were sent to the front line of Panmunjom. They arrived at the position on April 10th and were taken prisoner after six days in the position. If they were not lying, they were captured alive in their first battle. The time they spent on the battlefield was not even as long as the time it took to walk from the United States to the battlefield.

When talking about the ratio of new and old soldiers in the U.S. 1st Marine Division, they said: "Many new recruits have been added. In our platoon, there are only six or seven old soldiers. In our squad, only the squad leader is an old soldier. According to the original regulations, new recruits were to be trained in Tokyo for a period of time before going to the front, but we only stopped in Tokyo for four hours before being sent to the front."

Talking about the relationship between their officers and soldiers, the nineteen-year-old said: "We are like machines. We have to do whatever we are told. The officers never discuss things with us, nor are we allowed to ask the reasons for things. Not to mention the big bosses, even the platoon leader doesn't remember our names. Life is really boring. Especially at night, when standing guard on the front line, it is really too scary. We all hate this war. We only hope for three things: that the armistice negotiations will succeed, that we will rotate home, or rotate to the rear for rest, and that night will turn to day sooner. ..."

The youngest one was injured in the eye when he was captured. After coming over, our medical staff treated him for a few days, and his eyes have become slightly clear. He was so moved by this that he shed tears three times. He said: "My hands were frostbitten and almost rotted this winter, and no one treated me or even asked me a question. I am your enemy, but after being captured, you treat my eyes like this. I am a fool. If I can go back in the future, I will never come to Korea to die again." We asked him how the Korean people there treated them, and he closed his eyes and said, "The Korean people all hate us. As soon as we arrive, the people all run away. That's for sure; the American soldiers are too bad to them."

Then, we asked them: "What do you often talk about in the squad? What are you most interested in?" They answered without thinking: "What we talk about the most and are most interested in is going home, when we can go home. As soon as we talk about going home, everyone gathers together."

This question, even after being captured, is obviously still the most interesting to them. The prisoner from a working-class background said: "I don't want to come to Korea to fight. I can't find a reason for us to come to Korea to interfere in the affairs of Koreans. None of us can find a reason for it. Therefore, I am very afraid of death. I think: Why should I die here? I have eleven people in my family. My parents, brothers, and sisters are all looking forward to my return. We soldiers all hope that the armistice negotiations will succeed..." At this time, the twenty-four-year-old vocational student said: "Going home is really the topic we like to talk about the most. Some time ago, our platoon leader made a bet with all of us. He said that the armistice negotiations would definitely be signed on April 1st, and he was willing to bet us all one hundred U.S. dollars. We all hoped that the negotiations would succeed, thinking that if it really succeeded, we would be willing to lose one hundred U.S. dollars to the platoon leader. If it didn't succeed, we could win one hundred U.S. dollars from the platoon leader. As a result, the platoon leader lost. He was very frustrated, and none of us was happy. We were willing to lose to him."

This led to the discussion of the responsibility for delaying the negotiations and the principle of exchanging prisoners. The prisoner from a working-class background said: "Anyway, the American people all hope to end this dirty war, and we soldiers are the same, and the sooner the better. An unconditional release of all prisoners after the armistice is even more righteous. This is not just what we say after becoming prisoners. However, those 'big bellies' have other ideas. They don't really want an armistice." The one who worked as a guard in the Panmunjom conference area said angrily: "I know it best. They bombed the neutral zone one moment, and the next they strafed the meeting place. When they had no other choice but to talk, they still dragged it out as much as possible. Some days they only held a thirty-second meeting. If they had any sincerity, I wouldn't be a prisoner." He took off his glasses and sighed heavily.

At this time, another prisoner rolled his eyes and said frankly: "Let them drag it out however they want. Anyway, I have already become a prisoner. Before becoming a prisoner, of course I didn't want to be a prisoner. I hoped for the armistice negotiations, and I hoped that the rotation period would come soon. But when the rotation period came, it was useless. Even when the rotation period arrived, they still wouldn't let us go. The negotiations are hopeless, and being a prisoner is still not bad. Otherwise, who knows that one night I wouldn't suddenly be killed?..." I looked at the others, and they didn't have any dissatisfied expressions. Obviously, they all agreed with this statement.

In addition, many other things were discussed. Their thoughts are very complicated. Everyone has different ideas. Like the prisoner from a working-class background, after our initial education, he knew that the American war of aggression against Korea was unjust. He understood that today's American government does not represent the people's government. He said that if he were to vote in this year's election, he would not vote for Truman, nor for Eisenhower or Dewey, because they are all watchdogs of the capitalists. He also vaguely realized that the American people must rise up to fight and should control their own destiny and not let these people manipulate them, but he did not know which path to take. Another example is the vocational student who received thirteen years of "education." He only knew that if he did not come to fight, he could have a money-making career. He is the most reactionary of the five. There is also one who just wants to quickly write a letter to his family saying that he is not dead yet. The eighteen-year-old just wants to know how to go back and get married as soon as possible. The five people have five kinds of thoughts, but one thing is common to all of them, and that is: they all know that the war they are participating in is unpopular, and they can't find a reason to come to fight. They all feel that they will definitely fail and have no confidence in victory. They all unanimously hope that they will have an armistice as soon as possible and go home. If not, they would rather be prisoners.

These "soldiers" are in stark contrast to the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers, who are all filled with righteous indignation, each as fierce as a dragon or tiger, and each full of confidence in victory.

These five prisoners are not special. They are the representatives of the "morale" of the American invading army. If they are special, then it is: they are from the famous U.S. 1st Marine Division, the American "Ace Army," and, according to the prisoners themselves, their 5th Regiment is the "best" regiment, and their company is the "best" in the 5th Regiment.

### 几个美国“王牌军”俘虏

    几个美国“王牌军”俘虏
    李蕤
    在开城前线某地，一个开满各种野花的山村里，我和几个年青的同志们，去看几个刚刚从前线捉来的美国俘虏。
    这几个美国俘虏，都是美国海军陆战队第一师的。这个师有一百七十五年的历史，号称“王牌军”。美国侵略者为了替拖延谈判增添本钱，特地把这张“王牌”从东线抽到开城前线，接替了李伪军陆一师的阵地。这几个俘虏，都是第五团的，他们的团长不断对他们说：“要保持陆一师的光荣，当俘虏是最耻辱的事。七团在东线被俘的太多了，我们五团被俘的还不多，至少要保住本团的光荣。”但是，他们的兵却保持不住，也无心保持这个“光荣”。
    战斗的简单经过是这样的：四月十六号夜晚，开城前线我志愿军某部的一个加强连，发动了对一九五高地守敌的奇袭。敌人的阵地，是有几道外围工事的，有铁丝网，照明雷和种种“近代化”的防御障碍物。但是，在我志愿军的迅速而集中的炮火轰击下，敌人的防御工事被摧毁了，我们的战士很快便突入阵地，把这一连守敌完全分割包围，打死打伤七八十人，这五个就被活捉过来。俘虏们说：“你们的动作太快了，我们听到枪声往连部跑，连部已经被包围了。”
    这五个俘虏中，有两个是比较“顺当”地过来的。活捉他们的，是我们一个年纪才十八岁的新战士，他平常做梦也想立功见毛主席，这次就真正立了功。另外三个，被俘时拚命挣扎，不肯过来，战士们一发火，就像扛猪一样把他们抬下山来。事后问他们为什么不肯乖乖的过来，他们说：“第一，再差一天，就该轮换下去了。第二，我们是陆战队一师的，当俘虏太不光荣。第三，你们没有喊话。”我们的战士原都学过英语喊话的，但过去对面作战的是李伪军，喊李伪军投降的口号喊熟了，美海军陆战队一师是刚刚上来的，战士们冲锋的时候一紧张，忘记了喊英语的投降口号。俘虏们说：“你们要一喊话，我们就不那么害怕了。”
    这五个俘虏兵，都是美国海军陆一师五团第一连的，第一个二十岁，西班牙籍的上等兵。第二个二十四岁，美国籍，曾在建筑工程的专科学校毕业，毕业后还没有找到职业，就被征入伍。第三个二十二岁，原来是一个土木建筑工人，被强迫征调入伍。另外还有两个是糊里糊涂的小孩子，一个十九岁，另一个十八岁。他们从东线下来的时候，都以为是要轮换回家的，但结果却被送到板门店的前线上来。他们在四月十日到达阵地，在阵地六天就做了俘虏。如果他们没有说谎的话，他们是在第一次战斗中就被活捉了，到战场的时间，还没有从美国来战场走路的时间长。
    谈到美海军陆一师的新老兵的比例的时候，他们说：“补充的新兵很多。我们的一排里，老兵只有六七个。我们的班里，只有班长一个是老兵。按原来的规定，新兵是到东京训练一个时期才到前线的，但是我们在东京只停了四个钟头，就开到前线来了。”
    谈到他们军官和士兵的关系时，那个十九岁的说：“我们好像机器一样，叫我们做什么就得做什么，长官从来不和我们商量事情，也不许我们问事情的道理。不说再大的头儿吧，就是排长，连我们的名字也不记得。生活真无味极了。尤其是夜里在前沿站岗放哨，实在太怕人。我们大家都讨厌这个战争，我们只盼望三件事：盼望停战谈判成功，盼望轮换回家，或者轮换到后方休息，还有，晚上盼望天快些亮。……”
    那个年纪最轻的，在被俘时眼睛受了伤，过来后，我们的医务人员替他医治了几天，他的眼睛已经微微通明，他为这感动得流了三次眼泪。他说：“我的手今年冬天冻坏了，几乎烂掉，谁也不替我治一治，或问过我一声。我是你们的敌人，被俘后你们反而这样替我治眼睛。我是个糊涂虫，如果将来能回去，一辈子也不再到朝鲜来送死了。”我们问他，那边朝鲜的老百姓对他们怎么样，他闭着眼睛，说：“朝鲜老百姓都恨我们。我们一到，老百姓都跑光了。那是当然的，我们美国兵对他们太坏了。”
    接着，我们问他们：“你们在班里面，常常谈些什么？什么事对你们最有兴趣？”他们毫不思索地回答道：“我们谈得最多的，最感到兴趣的是回家，什么时候能够回家。一说到回家，大家就凑到
    一块了。”
    这个问题，就在被俘以后，显然对他们还是最有兴趣的。那个工人出身的俘虏说：“我不愿到朝鲜来作战。我找不出我们来朝鲜干涉朝鲜人事情的理由。我们谁也找不出它的理由来。因此我很怕死。我想：为什么要死在这里呢？我家里有十一口人，爸爸妈妈、弟弟妹妹都盼望我回去。我们士兵们都希望停战谈判成功，……”这时，那个二十四岁的专科学生说：“回家，真是我们最喜欢谈的题目了。前些时，我们的排长和我们大家打赌，他说四月一号停战谈判准可以签字，他情愿以一百块美金和我们大家打赌。我们大家都是希望谈判成功的，想着，如果真能成功，大家情愿输给排长一百块美金，如果不成功呢，可以赢排长一百美元。结果，排长输了。他很懊恼，我们也没有人高兴。我们是情愿输给他的。”
    这样就谈到了拖延谈判的责任，谈到交换俘虏的原则。那个工人出身的说：“反正，我们美国的人民，都是希望结束这个不干净的战争的，我们兵士也一样，而且越快越好。停战了全部释放俘虏，那更是天公地道的。这可不是我们当了俘虏才这样说。可是，那些‘大肚子’们，他们另有心思呀，他们那里是真想停战呢？”那个在板门店会场区做过守卫人员的，他愤愤地说：“我知道的最清楚，他们一会轰炸中立区，一会扫射会场，没办法了再谈，也是尽量的拖，有些日子每天只开三十秒钟的会。他们要有一分诚意，我也不会做俘虏了。”他脱下他的眼镜，重重叹一口气。
    这时候，另一个俘虏翻翻眼睛，坦率地说：“他们爱怎样拖就怎样拖吧，反正我已经成了俘虏了。没有当俘虏的时候，我当然不愿当俘虏，我盼望停战谈判，盼望轮换期限快到。可是轮换期限到了也没有用呀，到了轮换期还是不叫走。谈判又没指望，当了俘虏也还是不错的。要不，谁知道那一夜不会忽然被打死呢？……”我望望其他的几个人，他们也没有什么不满意的表情。显然他们是都同意这样的说法的。
    此外，还谈了许多事情。他们的思想很复杂，每个人有不同的想法，像那个工人出身的俘虏，经过我们的初步教育，他知道美国侵朝的战争是不义的。他明白美国今天的政府不是代表人民的政府。他说，今年大选如果要他投票，他不投杜鲁门，也不投艾森豪威尔或杜威，因为他们都是资本家的看门狗。他也模模糊糊地意识到美国人民要起来进行斗争，应该自己掌握自己的命运，不能再让这些人来摆布，但他不知道走什么路。又如那个受过十三年“教育”的专科学生，他只知道如果不来打仗，他可以有一个赚钱的职业。他是五个人中最反动的。还有一个只想赶快写一封信给家里的人，说他还没有死。那个十八岁的，只想怎样早日回去结婚。五个人有五种思想，但，有一点却是他们共同的，那就是：他们都知道他们参加的战争是不得人心的，他们找不出为什么要来作战的理由。他们都觉得他们一定会失败，丝毫没有胜利的信心。他们一致希望他们早早停战，各自回家。如果不能，就宁愿做俘虏。
    这些“兵”，和个个义愤填胸，个个如龙如虎，个个充满胜利信心的中朝人民战士比较起来，正是一个十分鲜明的对照。
    这五个俘虏，并不是特殊的，他们就是美国侵略军“士气”的代表。如果说特殊的话，那么就是：他们是鼎鼎大名的美国海军陆战队一师的，是美国的“王牌军”，而且，据俘虏们自己说，他们五团是“最好的”一个团，他们这一连又是五团中“最好的”。
