The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government
Summary of Railway Work in 1951 and Tasks for 1952
(Report by Minister Teng Taiyuan at the 139th Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 6, 1952, approved by the same meeting)

A. Basic Summary of 1951

In 1951, railway transportation bore the dual tasks of supporting the just struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and serving the development of the people's economy. The work of this year was carried out in accordance with the general policy of combining the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, conducting in-depth patriotic education, implementing the idea of relying on the working class, launching mass-based competitions and creating new records to improve transportation efficiency, focusing on implementing economic accounting systems, striving for increased production and practicing strict economy, so as to exert the potential power of railways and increase enterprise profits, thereby appropriately improving the lives of railway employees. The basic situation of railway work in the past year was that transportation capacity was unprecedentedly insufficient while transportation volume increased significantly. The national plan for 1951 was basically completed, thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Government Administration Council, as well as the frequent supervision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and the efforts of all railway workers, staff, engineering and technical personnel, railway public security personnel, and railway engineering troops. The main items are as follows:

The task of loading and transporting vehicles was completed at 111.6% of the plan, an increase of 11.3% compared to 1950, completing the national task seven days ahead of schedule.

The number of tons of goods sent completed 109.6% of the annual plan, and the extended ton-kilometers completed 113.4% of the annual plan, an increase of 29.7% compared to 1950. The national freight car turnaround rate (i.e., freight car turnaround time) was shortened by 0.11 days compared to the annual plan and 0.12 days compared to 1950.

The number of passengers carried completed 105.9% of the annual plan, and the extended passenger-kilometers completed 111.5% of the annual plan, an increase of 9.6% compared to 1950.

The cost per converted ton-kilometer was reduced by 23.32% compared to the planned cost.

Due to the overfulfillment of the transportation plan, the revenue task was overfulfilled by 131.4%.

Due to the reduction in transportation costs, operating expenses were reduced by 13.87% compared to the original plan.

The labor productivity of each transportation business worker completed 117.4% of the annual plan.

A total of 771 kilometers of new roads were built throughout the year, including the Laibin-Zhennan section of Guangxi, 402 kilometers, which was opened to traffic to Pingxiang, the terminal, on November 7; the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, 132 kilometers, which was opened to traffic to Gangu on December 1; and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, 237 kilometers, which was opened to traffic to Neijiang on December 7. A total of 113.6% of the annual plan was completed. 135 kilometers of double track were repaired, and 148 kilometers of lines were restored.

In the past year, various repair schedules for locomotives have been completed at 107% in terms of the number of vehicles, passenger cars at 113.5%, and freight cars at 104.9%. The steel beam repair and manufacturing of the bridge factory completed 109.9% of the plan.

In 1951, the railway employees' wages implemented a new wage grade system based on the principle of "to each according to his work" and adjustments were made. The average wage score of employees in the Northeast region increased by 6.9% from April, and the various bureaus within the customs began to implement it from August to December, with an average wage score increase of about 10%. Not only did the material treatment of the vast majority of employees improve and increase, but it also changed the extremely unreasonable wage system of the old railways for many years, becoming an important part of democratic reform. This new wage system has greatly promoted the improvement of employees' production technology and labor productivity and the exertion of production potential. It also provided a guideline for the cultivation, promotion, and use of cadres and the rational organization of labor, laying a preliminary foundation for the establishment of a progressive piece-rate wage system, contract system, and reasonable reward system.

Due to the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations by the Central People's Government, more than 560,000 railway employees and more than 1.6 million family members have enjoyed labor insurance benefits, and various collective labor insurance undertakings are also developing vigorously. As of the end of 1951, a total of 52 sanatoriums and rest homes, and after-work rest homes have been established or are being established, with a total of 4,132 beds, with an average of one person out of every 30 employees able to receive a sanatorium or rest each year. In 1951, 28.4 billion yuan was spent within the customs to improve safety and health equipment and strengthen prevention and medical work, reducing the disease and mortality rates of railway workers.

In the 1951 budget, three times the amount of funds in 1950 was used to purchase sanitary equipment and medicines. In 1951, the state invested in the construction of a total of 233,000 square meters of new dormitories for employees, and the morale of the employees is very high.

With the improvement of material life, the cultural life of railway employees has also greatly improved. A total of 201,078 people participated in cultural studies, 312,138 in political studies, and 165,090 in technical studies. At present, there are 893 clubs, 754 libraries, 57 mobile film projection teams, and 851 amateur theater troupes established throughout the railway, and 667 units have established broadcasting equipment.

The transportation situation in the past year, on the one hand, reflected the improvement of the national economy; on the other hand, it proved that there is a huge potential buried in the railways, and some of the potential was discovered under the difficult circumstances of 1951.

In the past year, a large amount of manpower has been drawn from the railway system to participate in transportation and repair work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Under the education of combining patriotism and internationalism, railway employees rushed to volunteer to aid Korea. Those who signed up accounted for more than 75% of the total number of railway employees. Most of those who did not get to go abroad transformed their will to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea into production power, and universally signed patriotic covenants and launched patriotic competition movements. The total amount of donations from the entire railway to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was 41.2 billion yuan, equivalent to 27 fighter planes. The employees in Korea gained experience in repairing and transporting in modern warfare, and they guaranteed the completion of transportation tasks with selfless spirit under difficult material and climatic conditions. 80% of them received merit awards. This is the glory of the Chinese working class and the glory of the Chinese people.

In the past year, in the mass-based patriotic competition movement, a large number of advanced workers emerged. A total of 2,169 people were selected to participate in the labor model conferences of the management bureaus. The advanced driver Zheng Xikun's locomotive crew was the first to achieve an over-axle traction of 4,174 tons. Thanks to the lead of switchman Li Xikui and his switching crew, the freight car stopover time at Shenyang Station at the end of 1951 increased by 32.5% compared to before the establishment of the China Changchun Railway, and the transfer time increased by 112%. Weigher Yang Maolin increased the static load of less-than-carload freight cars by 8 tons with his created loading method. Zhang Huaiyu increased the number of brake shoes cast from 15 boxes per day to 160 boxes per day. The Ministry of Railways held a national railway labor model conference in September to exchange advanced experience and further improve the class consciousness of advanced workers. Four advanced work method training classes were opened, training 600 activists. With the lead of a large number of advanced workers, the national railways launched a struggle to shorten vehicle turnaround time. Therefore, in the second half of the year, although it undertook a large task of aiding Korea, it was still able to overfulfill the transportation plan.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is one of the important factors for our overfulfillment of the plan. In order to improve the operation and management of railways, a total of 117 units formally implemented the economic accounting system this year, and 65 units are piloting it. In addition to transferring cadres to the China Changchun Railway to learn implementation methods, financial, accounting, and statistical personnel were also trained, accounting systems and cost accounting were established at the grassroots level, and the current assets of various units were cleared. The attitude of not accounting after completing tasks in the past was basically changed, and the tendency to neglect the calculation of materials was corrected, laying the foundation for the widespread implementation of the economic accounting system in 1952. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the economic accounting system, various bureaus conducted work-hour and material quota surveys, resulting in many progressive records, shortening non-production time, reducing material waste, and further improving production organization. In order to learn Soviet transportation management, two transportation training classes were opened in the third quarter. Station masters, transportation section chiefs, branch chiefs, and management bureau chiefs of major stations generally received a systematic study. The railway transportation training class trained 3,500 people. In addition, more than 1,000 cadres and labor models were organized to study at the China Changchun Railway, and more than 4,000 employees visited and learned at the China Changchun Railway. This planned learning method can promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union throughout the country, not only improving business standards but also providing practical political education.

In the transportation work throughout the year, we often received the supervision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the assistance of local governments, which is an important condition for implementing planned transportation and eliminating the off-season. Railways and enterprise shippers signed transportation contracts, consigned goods according to plan, and strived for seasonal balanced transportation. The national planned transportation reached 80%, and the transportation volume in the off-season from June to September exceeded the plan by 19%, fundamentally changing the historical practice of seasonal peaks and troughs. The local government provided greater assistance in the construction of new roads. The Southwest mobilized 100,000 migrant workers to participate in road construction, and the Northwest and Guangxi migrant workers also numbered in the tens of thousands. The commissioners, counties, districts, and township cadres personally led the teams, with supply exceeding demand. The enthusiasm of the masses is the decisive condition for the early opening of new roads.

In addition to the above reasons, we also took several important measures in 1951, such as the rational transportation method for major materials in the Northeast. In terms of coal alone, the average transportation distance per ton throughout the year was shortened by 86.7 kilometers compared to 1950, saving 1.4 billion ton-kilometers of transportation capacity. If this transportation capacity is used to increase coal transportation, it can increase revenue by 88.2 billion yuan. Secondly, a large number of direct trains were formed to shorten transfer time. In mid-July, regulations were formulated to increase the load of freight cars, tapping into a large potential of vehicles. The circular superior red flag reward was implemented in August, which greatly promoted the improvement of business. The movements of over-axle traction and locomotive running 500 kilometers per day were launched, and soft water work was promoted, saving 587,000 tons of coal for locomotives throughout the year, equivalent to 93.1 billion yuan. In order to reduce non-operational vehicles, a new Soviet freight car repair system and new freight car repair technical operation procedures were adopted. In basic construction projects, emphasis was placed on political leadership and the principle of implementing design before construction. Since the inspection team led by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council went to the Northwest for inspection, Director Wang Shitai of the Northwest Main Line Engineering Bureau and personnel sent by the ministry personally went to the Tianlan line to determine the design and reorganize the construction plan, shortening the estimate that it would not be possible to open to traffic until 1953 to 1952. This not only saved investment but also enabled the economic development of the Northwest to be advanced by at least half a year. In addition, the Ministry of Railways and various railway bureaus and engineering bureaus sent people to the front line to check the waste caused by violating basic construction procedures, which played a certain role in correcting blind construction. The feudal exploitative contracting system was abolished, and its own engineering team was formed, laying the foundation for the industrialization of construction in the future.

In 1951, from late March to June, a large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement was launched throughout the railway, cracking 290 counter-revolutionary cases, seizing 14 enemy radio stations, 113 guns, and 780 various documents, and reporting more than 18,000 counter-revolutionaries inside and outside the railway (Zhao Jixian, the murderer of the "February 7th" massacre, was also reported). The movement was basically correct and healthy, severely打击the counter-revolutionaries within the railway and further purifying the railway organization. During the movement, more than 10,400 outstanding employees were promoted to leadership positions at the middle and lower levels, and the broad masses of employees improved their political awareness and production enthusiasm during the movement.

On April 1, 1951, international through transport with the Soviet Union began, and responsible transport within the country was handled, strengthening employees' awareness of cherishing freight and reducing cargo losses, laying a preliminary foundation for standardized cargo transport. However, the surcharge for responsible fees and the natural reduction of goods generally reflected higher regulations, and we plan to re-regulate them.

Although the above achievements have been obtained in the past year, there are still many important shortcomings in our work, which were exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement. The "Three-Anti" movement is currently in the process of cleaning up and finalizing cases. Extravagance and waste are relatively common phenomena, and the losses caused are even greater. In basic construction, construction is carried out without approved designs and budgets, and some are blindly constructed without any designs and budgets. After construction starts, the design is changed again, and some designs are not practical. The construction lacks strict and careful inspection, and materials are stolen and cut, the quality is poor, some standards are too high, and the unit prices are too expensive. Some early or unnecessary large marshalling stations are opened, such as Chang'an Station and Shanhaiguan Large Marshalling Station. The manpower and material resources caused by this directly cause waste, and also delay the construction period and accumulate funds. The use of funds and materials in basic construction lacks timely statistics and supervision, which is the biggest obstacle to our becoming regular. The main manifestation of bureaucracy is insufficient reliance on the masses, insufficient in-depth connection with reality, lack of clear understanding, lack of investigation and research, and a meticulous working style. The great role of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses is underestimated, and the summary and promotion of Soviet experience and the advanced working methods of labor models are not done enough. In addition, because we are not proficient in our business and do not study hard enough, we sometimes show hesitation in adhering to old experience and expressing hesitation about new methods and new systems, which also hinders the timely improvement of work efficiency and the exertion of potential power. These shortcomings require us to overcome vigorously, otherwise, our work cannot advance rapidly.

On January 25, 1952, due to the surge in passengers during the Spring Festival at Shenyang Station, the local office of the Ministry's Northeast Special Envoy's Office lacked prior preparation for adding trains for the habit of workers in such a large industrial city as Shenyang to go home for the New Year. When passengers in the elevated waiting room became crowded, the station and the railway public security station did not open more exits to organize evacuation, resulting in a major accident with deaths and injuries to passengers. The occurrence of this accident was entirely due to the leadership's negligence in work and the irresponsible work attitude of the personnel directly related to the accident. In addition to myself and Vice Minister Lu Zhengcao requesting punishment and being exempted from discussion by order of the Government Administration Council, Yu Guangsheng, the special envoy of the Ministry of Railways to the Northeast, was given a demerit, Deputy Special Envoy Su Mei was given a major demerit, and Yang Guohui, the director of the transportation department of the Special Envoy's Office, was removed from his post. Other relevant personnel were given punishments separately by order of the Government Administration Council, and the painful lessons caused by this accident were published in a circular to educate employees and draw lessons from it in order to avoid the recurrence of such events.

B. Situation from January to May 1952

From January to May 1952, the average daily completion rate of the vehicle loading task was only 87% of the plan. The reasons for not completing the vehicle loading plan, in addition to the New Year and Spring Festival holidays, were mainly that the annual plans of various industrial and mining enterprises had not been determined, and the leadership paid great attention to the "Three-Anti" movement, and many goods were not consigned. The railway also relaxed its leadership in this regard.

From January to May, the new freight car manufacturing completed 52.7% of the plan, and the locomotive repair and manufacturing plan completed 96.2%. The passenger car repair and manufacturing plan completed 92.2%, the freight car repair and manufacturing plan completed 118.5%, and the steel beam repair and manufacturing plan completed 100.5%.

Regarding the construction of new lines, they are currently being actively constructed. If there are no special unexpected circumstances, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will be opened to traffic to Chengdu on July 1 ahead of schedule, and the Tianshui-Lanzhou line will also be opened to traffic to Lanzhou at the end of this year ahead of schedule.

Regarding the work of clearing assets and verifying funds, the fixed asset valuation standard has been drafted and promulgated for implementation, the management regulations after the fixed asset inventory will be announced soon, and the clearing work of current assets was completed at the end of February. The surplus materials have been arranged for each road to hand in 40% of the amount, and this task is listed as one of the conditions for obtaining enterprise reward funds and red flag bonuses in 1952.

Although some tasks have been accumulated in the past five months, the phenomenon from January to May is a temporary phenomenon. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the national economic life will inevitably further embark on a normal and active path. Even from the perspective of the railway sector, the new atmosphere after the "Three-Anti" movement has already taken shape. Capitalist viewpoints in business management, technical guidance, and other aspects have been subjected to considerable criticism and liquidation. In the process of reviewing the 1952 plan within the ministry, the vast majority of units checked and revised the various indicators before the "Three-Anti" movement, criticized conservative thinking, and further strengthened their confidence in relying on the masses to overcome difficulties and strive to overfulfill the plan. Although the overall freight situation has not yet undergone sufficient and necessary changes, the vehicle loading situation in April and May shows a steady upward trend. On the basis of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, as long as the organization of freight sources is strengthened, the future freight situation will definitely increase substantially.

C. Tasks for 1952

In 1952, on the one hand, it is necessary to continue to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and on the other hand, it is necessary to shoulder the transportation tasks that have increased even more after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In particular, the freight volume that the country failed to complete in the first five months of 1952 must be balanced in the next seven months, which adds to the tension of the work. At the same time, in order to meet and cooperate with future economic construction, preparations in planning, organization, and systems must also be strived to be completed quickly. Therefore, 1952 is an unprecedentedly heavy year for railway work.

In 1952, the number of tons of freight transported nationwide increased by 19.1% compared to 1951, the number of chargeable ton-kilometers of freight transported nationwide increased by 25.5% compared to 1951, the number of passengers transported nationwide increased by 3.1% compared to 1951, and the turnaround time of standard-gauge freight cars nationwide was shortened by another 0.25 days compared to the actual results of 1951, in order to further improve the efficiency of freight car utilization. We must make every effort to complete the original profit depreciation control figures. In terms of basic construction of national railways, while ensuring the quality of the project, in addition to the tasks of manufacturing locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, and purchasing machinery, the construction and installation projects should strive to save 20% within the original control figures in order to increase the new workload.

The current situation of the people's railways is: the democratic reform work is basically approaching completion, and the entire railway is about to enter the historical stage centered on production reform. The general policy of the national railway work in 1952 is to continue to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea on the basis of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, deeply implement the movement to increase production and practice economy, overcome the "Three Harms," fully mobilize the masses, clearly rely on the masses, implement democratic management, strengthen planned management, conduct in-depth inspections, vigorously promote advanced working methods, and continue to promote the economic accounting system, in order to achieve improved quality, reduced costs, and increased profits, in preparation for larger railway construction work across the country.

The production and financial plan and basic construction plan for 1952 are currently being carefully reviewed by the Ministry of Railways. After approval, they will be communicated and discussed in various production and construction units, so as to strive to determine the plans of this unit from bottom to top before the end of June, through the lead of advanced workers, and specific technical measures and specific indicators for improving quality and reducing costs, so that every employee can clearly understand in their daily work what kind of goal they are striving to achieve, and understand the significance of their own, their team's, and the workshop's specific production labor on the entire unit's plan, so as to give higher play to the working enthusiasm of the employees as masters and mutual supervision and encouragement, and promote the overfulfillment of the national plan with patriotic competition.

In launching and organizing mass production and economy movements, the leadership should focus on vigorously carrying out the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements as the central link, and promote the advanced working methods of Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, and Yang Maolin. Experience has proved that this is the greatest driving force for promoting production reform within railway enterprises, and it is also a concentrated expression of railway transportation capacity. All old management systems and old production quotas will inevitably be negated with the development of the movement. New management systems and new production quotas will be created quickly. Therefore, it has become an important lever for promoting the economic accounting system. In addition, this movement also has the role of ideological transformation for railway employees throughout the railway. All simple technical viewpoints that ignore politics, conservative viewpoints that are divorced from reality, and viewpoints that blindly worship Anglo-American capitalism will have to be revised in the face of living facts. This will inevitably promote all leading cadres, management personnel, engineers, and technicians who have the above-mentioned erroneous viewpoints to change their erroneous viewpoints, so that they can further recognize the policy of relying on workers, running railways well, connecting with reality, and taking the socialist road.

Adjust the organization, streamline personnel, and boldly promote outstanding worker cadres. Cultivating worker cadres and uniting and transforming technical personnel are important guarantees for us to complete our tasks. The organizations that were defeated in the "Three-Anti" movement or where cadres were improperly assigned in the past should be quickly reorganized or supplemented. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the Tianjin Management Bureau promoted hundreds of people from the Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan branches to serve as section chiefs, stock chiefs, directors, station masters, foremen, and foremen, of whom 63% to 80% were directly promoted from workers. They all have a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, humbly learn, are good at connecting with the masses, and overcome difficulties to complete tasks, breaking the erroneous ideas of some people who suspect that worker cadres do not understand technology, have low cultural levels, and cannot do leadership work well. In order to train worker cadres, preparations are being made to systematically select worker labor models and worker children to conduct intermediate technical training to improve their technical level so that they can better perform their work. Continue to implement the policy of uniting and transforming technical personnel, and through their consciousness, thoroughly wash away the old influences of simple technology, disregard for labor, detachment from reality, individualism, and American worship and conservatism given to them by the bourgeoisie, so that they can be transformed into people who are connected with reality, connected with the masses, and combined with the broad masses of workers under the leadership of the Communist Party. The technical personnel.

In basic construction, we must resolutely implement the policy of not constructing without design. In order to meet the large-scale construction of new lines and new factories, we must vigorously strengthen and expand the surveying and design work, especially the political work in the surveying and design team, which is the key to determining whether our construction is good or bad and sooner or later. In the past, because our leadership in this area was insufficient, the designs made at the expense of time needed to be changed during the construction period, causing great waste. The management of the basic construction construction site must also be further strengthened, and a daily inspection system must be established so as to find problems and correct them immediately at any time. Experience has proved that without daily inspection during construction, it will often cause waste that is difficult to salvage afterwards. In order to reduce the construction cost of basic construction, we should actively establish construction site work-hour and material statistics, and vigorously promote the experience of advanced quota creators.

In production reform, focus on promoting the determination of technical quotas, the inspection of material quantification, and fully mobilize the masses to continuously create new quotas and new standards to give play to the potential of personnel, the utilization rate of equipment, and the utilization rate of materials. In technical improvement, focus on promoting the learning of rationalization proposals and inventions and creations. On the basis of the implementation of the new wage grade system, focus on promoting the piece-rate wage system, while strengthening labor protection and improving working conditions, so that the improvement of labor productivity has a certain material basis.

Strengthen the accounting and statistical personnel of grassroots units, strictly control financial plans, analyze and study financial results from cost accounting, supervise the implementation of the material system, improve the turnover rate of current assets, fully utilize waste materials, and strengthen the work of internal capital accumulation of the railway.

Judging from the political and ideological situation exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement, political work must be strengthened. The existing political organizations at all levels must be enriched, and the staffing and adjustment of cadres should be appropriately increased.

The plan for 1952 is more arduous than the plan for 1951, but on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, under the great call of Chairman Mao to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, which is the central task of the Chinese people today," railway employees across the country will work together with the working class across the country, will be able to exert all their strength and creativity, and continue to support the just struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We guarantee that we will strive to fully complete and exceed the glorious task of transportation and construction given to railway employees across the country by the Central People's Government.

?Extended ton-kilometers: The extended mileage traveled by each ton of goods, also known as loaded ton-kilometers or cargo ton-kilometers, calculated by multiplying the number of tons of cargo by the kilometers traveled.
?Freight car turnaround rate (i.e., freight car turnaround time): The average number of days required for each freight car to complete one turnaround, from the time of the first loading, through loading, shunting, operation, transfer, unloading, etc., to the time of the second loading, is called the freight car turnaround rate.
?Extended passenger-kilometers: The extended mileage traveled by each passenger, also known as passenger-kilometers, calculated by multiplying the number of passengers by the kilometers traveled.
?Converted ton-kilometers: The sum of both extended passenger-kilometers and extended ton-kilometers, used to indicate the production volume of the railway.
?Transfer time: The time a freight car spends at a transfer station, from the time of arrival to the time of departure, is called transfer time.
?Static load: The number of tons of goods loaded in the freight car at the originating station. The more goods loaded, the higher the static load, and the level of the static load can be used to see whether the freight car is fully loaded.
?Soft water work: That is, injecting soft water agent into the locomotive's water to soften the mineral deposits contained in the water, reducing the adhesion of these minerals to the boiler tank plate and the size of the flue, that is, reducing the corrosion of these minerals to the tank plate and the flue and the poor thermal conductivity.
?Non-operational vehicles: All freight cars used for transporting various types of goods other than freight, such as department spare cars, occupied cars, bureau work cars, special cars, repair cars, and rental cars of department-affiliated units, are called non-operational vehicles.
?Chargeable ton-kilometers of freight: The same as extended ton-kilometers, but because the calculation of freight is rounded to the nearest integer according to regulations, it is calculated according to the kilometers for calculating freight.
?Full load, over-axle, 500 kilometers: The general meaning is to load more, pull more, and run faster. 1. Full load: Railways use freight cars, each with its prescribed load capacity, so full load not only requires reaching the prescribed freight car load capacity, but also requires continuous improvement of loading technology to achieve economical and economical use of vehicles. 2. Over-axle: Also known as "over-traction" or "over-ton," it refers to the number of train tons that a certain type of locomotive needs to pull in the same section beyond the original regulations. (But drivers must have good operating skills) 3. 500 kilometers: On the surface, it seems to require all locomotives to run 500 kilometers in 24 hours, but it is not actually so. It refers to the maximum mileage that each locomotive must travel in 24 hours under different line conditions and locomotive quality. In order to run faster, it is necessary to increase the locomotive travel speed and shorten the stopover time at the outer section and station. Because fast running can save the number of locomotive operating units and the expenditure of expenses.

    一九五一年铁路职工工资施行了以按劳付酬为原则的新工资等级制度并进行了调整，东北地区职工自四月份起，平均工资分数上涨百分之六点九，关内各局自八月至十二月亦分别施行，平均工资分数上涨约为百分之十。不仅使绝大部分职工的物质待遇得到改善与提高，而且改变了多年旧铁路的极不合理的工资制度，成为民主改革的一个重要组成部分。这一新的工资制度对于职工生产技术、劳动生产率的提高与生产潜在力的发挥上起了很大的推动作用。使培养、提拔、使用干部以及劳动力的合理组织上也有了准绳，为建立进步的计件工资制、包工制与合理的奖励制度打下了初步基础。
    由于中央人民政府颁布了劳动保险条例，全国铁路已有五十六万余职工和一百六十余万职工家属享受了劳动保险待遇，各种集体劳动保险事业也在蓬勃地发展着，截至一九五一年止，已经建立或正在建立的疗养院和休养所、业余休养所共五十二处，共有床位四、一三二个，平均每三十个职工中每年有
    一人可以得到一次疗养或休养。一九五一年关内已开支二百八十四亿元用于改善安全卫生设备和加强预防与医疗工作，减低了铁路工人的疾病伤亡率。
    一九五一年预算中用三倍于一九五零年的款项，购置了卫生器材和药品。一九五一年国家投资为职工新建宿舍共计二十三万三千平方公尺，员工的情绪是很高的。
    随着物质生活的改善，铁路职工的文化生活也大大提高了，参加文化学习的共二○一、○七八人，参加政治学习的共三一二、一三八人，参加技术学习的共一六五、○九○人。现在全路已建立了八百九十三处俱乐部，七百五十四处图书馆，五十七个流动电影放映队，八百五十一个业余剧团，有六百六十七个单位建立了广播设备。
    一年来的运输情况，一方面反映了国家经济的好转；一方面证明了铁路上埋藏着巨大的潜在力，部分潜在力是在一九五一年的困难情况下被发掘出来的。
    一年来由铁道系统中抽调了很大的人力参加抗美援朝的运输与抢修工作，在爱国主义与国际主义相结合的教育下，铁路职工争先恐后志愿援朝，参加签名的占全路职工总数的百分之七十五以上，多数未得出国者，则将抗美援朝的意志变为生产的力量，普遍订立爱国公约，开展爱国主义竞赛运动。全路抗美援朝捐献共计四百一十二亿元，折合战斗机二十七架。在朝职工取得了现代战争中抢修抢运的锻炼和经验，他们在物质和气候等困难条件下，以忘我的精神保证完成运输任务。其中百分之八十立了功，这是中国工人阶级的光荣，也是中国人民的光荣。
    一年来在群众性的爱国主义竞赛运动中，涌现大批先进工人，被选参加管理局劳动模范大会者共计二千一百六十九人。先进司机郑锡坤机车包乘组，最早超轴牵引达到四千一百七十四吨。由于调车员李锡奎及其调车组的带头，一九五一年年底曾使沈阳站货车在车站停留时间较中长路成立前提高了百分之三十二点五，中转时间?提高了百分之一百一十二。司磅员杨茂林以其创造的装车法将零担货车静载重?增加了八吨。张怀玉铸闸瓦由一天十五箱提高到一天一百六十箱。铁道部于九月间召开全国铁路劳动模范大会，交流了先进经验，并使先进工作者的阶级觉悟得到进一步的提高。开办了四个先进工作方法训练班，训练积极分子六○○人。经过大批先进工人的带头，全国铁路开展了缩短车辆周转时间的斗争，因此在下半年虽然担负很大援朝任务，还能超额完成运输计划。
    学习苏联先进经验是我们超额完成计划的重要因素之一。为了改进铁路的经营管理，本年正式实行经济核算制者共一百一十七个单位，试行者共六十五个单位，除抽调干部到中长铁路学习实施方法外，还训练了财务、会计、统计人员，建立基层单位的会计制度与成本计算，清理了各单位的流动资金，基本上开始改变了过去完成任务不算账的态度，纠正了忽视计算材料的偏向，打下了一九五二年广泛推行经济核算制的基础。为了配合实行经济核算制，各局分别进行了工时和材料定额的查定工作，产生了很多进步纪录，缩短了非生产时间，减少了用料浪费，生产组织也得到进一步的改善。为了学习苏联的运输管理，第三季度曾开办了两期运输训练班，大站站长、运输科长、分局长、管理局长普遍进行了一次系统的学习，全路运输训练班培养了三千五百人。此外，组织了一千多干部和劳动模范到中长路学习，四千多职工到中长路参观见习，采取这种有计划的学习方法，可把苏联先进经验推广全国，不但可提高业务水准，而且也是实际的政治教育。
    在全年的运输工作中，我们经常得到政务院财政经济委员会的督促和地方的协助，这是贯彻计划运输与消灭淡季的重要条件。铁路与各企业货主间签定运输合同，按计划托运，争取季节平衡运输，全国计划内运输达到百分之八十，六月至九月淡季运输量超过计划百分之十九，根本改变了历史上季节淡旺的惯例。新路建设，地方政府协助更大，西南动员十万民工参加筑路，西北、广西民工亦以数万计，专署、县、区、乡干部亲自带队，供过于求，群众的积极性，是新路提前通车的决定条件。
    除去上述原因外，一九五一年我们还采取了若干重要的措施，如东北的主要物资的合理运输办法，仅煤炭一项全年每吨平均运程较一九五零年缩短八十六点七公里，节省运输力达十四亿吨公里。如以这个运输力用来增加运煤，可以多收入八百八十二亿元。其次，大量编组直达列车，缩短中转时间。七月中旬规定了货车增载办法，发掘出很大的车辆潜在力。八月份开始实行循环优胜红旗奖励，对于业务的提高起了很大的推动作用。开展超轴牵引和机车每日走行五百公里运动，推行软水工作?，全年节省机车用煤五十八万七千吨，折合人民币九百三十一亿元。为了减少非运用车?，采用了苏联新的货车检修制度及新的货车检修技术作业过程。在基本建设工程上，强调政治领导与贯彻先设计后施工的原则。西北干线工程局自从政务院财政经济委员会主持的检查组到西北检查，王世泰局长以及部内派人亲赴天兰沿线确定设计与重新组织了施工计划，把过去认为一九五三年都无法通车的估计缩短到一九五二年即可通车，不仅节省了投资，而且使西北经济发展至少可以提早半年。此外，铁道部及各路局各工程局均派人深入现场检查由于违反基本建设程序所造成的浪费现象，对于纠正盲目施工上起了一定的作用。废除封建剥削的包工制，组成了自己的工程队伍，为将来建筑工业化奠定了基础。
    一九五一年，自三月下旬起至六月止，全路开展了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，共破获反革命案件二百九十起，缴获敌电台十四部，枪一百一十三支，各种证件七百八十件，检举了铁路内外反革命分子一万八千余名（“二七”惨案的凶手赵继贤也被检举出来）。运动基本上是正确和健康的，严重地打击了铁路内部的反革命分子，使铁路组织得到进一步的纯洁。运动中提拔一万零四百余名优秀的职工担任中下层的领导工作，广大职工在运动中提高了政治觉悟和生产积极性。
    一九五一年四月一日，开始办理与苏联的国际联运，并办理国内的负责运输，加强了员工爱护货运物资的观念，减少了货物的损失，给正规化货物运输打下了初步基础。但负责费加价及货物的自然减量一般反映规定较高，我们拟重新加以规定。
        一年来虽然获得上述成就，但是我们工作中还存在着很多重要缺点，在“三反”运动中得到揭露。目前“三反”运动正进行清理定案的工作。铺张浪费是比较普遍的现象，而且所造成的损失更大。在基本建设中，设计和预算未批准就施工，有的根本没有设计和预算就盲目施工，开工后又改变设计，有的设计不切合实际，施工缺乏严格认真的检查，被偷工减料，质量不好，有的标准过高，单价太贵，有的过早的或不必要的增辟大编组站，如长安车站，山海关大编组站。由此所引起的人力、材料直接造成浪费外，还延误了工期，积压了资金。基本建设中的资金和材料的运用，缺乏及时的统计与监督，这是我们走向正规的最大障碍。官僚主义的主要表现是依靠群众不够，联系实际不深入，心中无数，缺乏调查研究与精打细算的工作作风，对于群众积极性创造性所产生的伟大作用估计不足，对于苏联经验与劳动模范的先进工作方法的总结与推广都做的不够。另外由于我们业务不精，钻研不力，有时还表现于扼守旧经验，对新方法新制度表现犹豫，也阻碍工作效率的及时提高与潜在力量的发挥，这些缺点要求我们大力克服，否则我们的工作是不可能迅速前进的。
    一九五二年一月二十五日，沈阳车站因春节旅客激增，本部东北特派员办事处驻在当地，对于沈阳这样大工业城市工人回家过年的习惯事先缺乏加开列车的准备，当高架候车室旅客发生拥挤时，车站与铁路公安驻在所亦未多开出口组织疏散，以致造成死伤旅客的重大事故，这次事故的产生完全是由于领导上工作疏忽与事故直接有关人员不负责任的工作态度造成的。除掉我本人及吕正操副部长自请处分奉政务院令示免议外，铁道部驻东北特派员余光生记过，副特派员苏梅记大过，特派员办事处车务部部长杨国辉撤职，其他有关人员均奉政务院令示分别给予处分，并将此次事故所造成的沉痛教训发布通报，教育员工，引为鉴戒，以避免此类事件的再度发生。乙、一九五二年一至五月的情况
    一九五二年一至五月的装车任务平均每日仅完成计划的百分之八十七，装车没有完成计划的原因，除掉新年及春节假期外，主要是各工矿企业年度计划没有确定，领导上以大力注意“三反”，许多货物没有托运。铁路上也放松了这方面的领导所致。
    一至五月份新造货车完成计划的百分之五十二点七，机车修造计划完成百分之九十六点二。客车修造计划完成百分之九十二点二，货车修造计划完成百分之一百一十八点五，钢梁修造计划完成百分之一百点五。
    关于新建线路现正积极修建，如无特殊意外情况，成渝路将提前在七月一日通车至成都，天兰线亦将提前于本年十月底通车至兰州。
    关于清理资产与核定资金工作，已拟定固定资产估价标准公布施行，固定资产清查后的管理规程即将公布，流动资产的清理工作在二月底即已做完，多余部分的材料一项已布置各路按百分之四十折款上缴，并以此任务列为一九五二年获得企业奖励基金与红旗奖金的条件之一。
    五个月来虽然积欠了若干任务，但一至五月的现象是一时的现象，在“三反”、“五反”后，全国经济生活必然进一步走上正常的活跃，即以铁道部门来看，“三反”后的新气象已然形成，经营管理、技术指导等方面的资本主义观点已受到了相当的批判与清算，一九五二年的计划在部内审核过程中，绝大多数的单位都检查并修正了“三反”前的各种指标，批判了保守思想，更进一步地加强了依靠群众克服困难争取超额完成计划的信心。整个货运情况，虽然还没有足够的应有的转变，但以四、五月份装车情况看，已有稳步上升的趋势。在“三反”、“五反”伟大胜利的基础上，只要加强货源的组织工作，今后的货运情况一定会有大量增加的。
     丙、一九五二年的任务
    一九五二年，一方面要继续支持抗美援朝的斗争，一方面要担负“三反”、“五反”以后更加增涨了的运输任务。特别是一九五二年前五个月全国未能完成的货运量要在今后七个月内求得平衡，这更加增添了工作的紧张性。同时，为了迎接与配合今后的经济建设，在计划、组织、制度上的准备工作也必须争取迅速完成。因此，一九五二年是铁道工作空前繁重的一年。
    一九五二年全国货运吨数较一九五一年增加了百分之十九点一，全国货运计费吨公里?较一九五一年增加百分之二十五点五，全国运送旅客人数较一九五一年增加百分之三点一，全国准轨货车周转时间较一九五一年实绩再缩短零点二五天，以期更加提高货车运用效率。我们要尽一切努力争取完成原利润折旧控制数字。全国铁路基本建设在保证工程质量的条件下，除机、客、货车制造及机具购置等任务外，建筑按装工程努力争取在原控制数字内节约百分之二十以增加新的工作量。
    目前人民铁道的情况是：民主改革工作基本上接近完成，全路即将进入以生产改革为中心的历史阶段。一九五二年全国铁路工作的总方针是在“三反”运动伟大胜利的基础上，继续支援抗美援朝斗争，深入贯彻增产节约运动，克服“三害”，充分发动群众，明确依靠群众，贯彻管理民主化，并加强计划管理，深入检查大力推行先进工作方法，继续推行经济核算制，以达到提高质量，降低成本，增加利润，以准备全国更大的铁路建设工作。
        一九五二年的生产财务计划及基本建设计划正在铁道部缜密审核中，批准之后，将在各生产建设单位进行传达讨论，以便争取在六月底以前自下而上的，经过先进工作者的带头，定出本单位的计划和提高质量、降低成本的具体技术措施与具体指标，使每个职工在日常工作中都能够清楚地了解要向一个什么样的目标奋斗前进，了解自己、自己所属小组、车间的每一个工作日的具体生产劳动对于整个单位计划的意义，从而更高地发挥职工群众的主人翁的劳动热情与互相督促鼓励，以爱国主义的竞赛，促进国家计划的超额实现。
    在发动与组织群众性的生产节约运动中，领导上要以大力开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动?为中心环节，推行郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林的先进工作方法，经验证明，这是铁道企业内部推动生产改革的最伟大的动力。也是铁路运输能力的集中表现。一切旧的管理制度，旧的生产定额，必将随着运动的开展被否定。新的管理制度，新的生产定额将会迅速地创造出来。因而它就成为推行经济核算制的重要杠杆。另外，这个运动对于全路职工还具有思想改造的作用，一切忽视政治的单纯技术观点，脱离实际的保守主义观点，和盲目崇拜英美资本主义的观点，在活的事实面前将不得不加以修正，这样，必然会推动具有上述错误观点的一切领导干部、管理人员、工程师和技术人员们改变他们的错误观点，使他们对于依靠工人，办好铁路、联系实际，走社会主义的道路的方针能够得到进一步的认识。
    调整机构，精简人员，大胆提拔优秀的工人干部。培养工人干部，团结改造技术人员是我们完成任务的重要保证。“三反”中被打垮的或过去干部配备不当的机构，要迅速加以改组或补充。“三反”中天津管理局北京、天津、太原三个分局各自提拔了几百人担任科长、股长、主任、站长、领工员、工长等领导工作，其中百分之六十三至百分之八十是由工人中直接提拔的，他们都是对革命事业有很高的责任心，虚心学习，善于联系群众，克服困难完成任务的模范，打破了一些人怀疑工人干部不懂技术、文化水平不高、做不好领导工作的错误观念。为了培养工人干部，准备有计划地挑选工人劳动模范、工人子弟进行中级技术训练，提高他们的技术水平，使他们更好地担任工作。对于技术人员继续贯彻团结改造的方针，通过他们的自觉，彻底清洗资产阶级给予他们的那些单纯技术、轻视劳动、脱离实际、个人主义、崇美保守等旧影响，使他们改造成为联系实际、联系群众，在共产党领导下的与广大工人群众相结合的人民的技术人员。
    在基本建设上，要坚决贯彻没有设计就不施工的方针。为了迎接大规模的新线和新厂的建设，要以大力加强与扩充勘测设计工作，特别是勘测设计队中的政治工作，这是决定我们建设好坏与迟早的重要关键。过去由于我们在这方面的领导不够，以致旷日费时做出的设计，到了施工期间还需要改，造成很大浪费。基本建设施工现场的管理也要进一步加强，必须建立日常检查制度，以便随时发现毛病立即纠正。经验证明：没有日常施工中的检查，往往会造成事后难于挽救的浪费。为了减低基本建设的建筑成本，应该积极建立施工现场的工时、材料统计，并以大力推广先进定额创造者的经验。
    在生产改革上着重于推行技术定额的测定、材料定量的检查，并充分发动群众不断地创造新定额、新标准，以发挥人员的潜在力、设备的运用率与材料的使用率，在技术改进上着重于推广合理化建议与发明创造的学习。在实行了新工资等级制度的基础上，重点推行计件工资制，同时加强劳动保护，改善工作条件，使劳动生产率的提高具有一定的物质基础。
    加强基层单位的会计统计人员，严格掌握财务计划，由成本计算做到财务结果的分析研究，监督材料制度的执行，提高流动资金的周转率，充分利用呆废料，加强铁路内部资金积累的工作。
    从“三反”运动中所暴露出的政治思想情况来看，必须加强政治工作。现有各级政治机构须加以充实，并适当增加定员与调整干部。
    一九五二年的计划比一九五一年的计划更为繁重，但是在“三反”胜利的基础上，在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，这是中国人民今天的中心任务”的伟大号召之下，全国铁路职工，将和全国工人阶级一道，能够发挥出自己的一切力量和创造性，继续支持抗美援朝的正义斗争。我们保证，我们将努力全部完成与超过中央人民政府给予全国铁路职工的运输与修建的光荣任务。
    ?延吨公里：为每一吨货物所走行的延长里程，也就是载重吨公里，或货物吨公里，用货物吨数乘所走行的公里数。
    ?货车周转率（即货车周转时间）：平均每辆货车由第一次装货时起，经过装车，调车，运行，中转，卸车等时间，至第二次装货时止，周转一次所需的天数，就叫做货车周转率。
    ?延人公里：为每一旅客所走行的延长里程，也就是旅客公里，用旅客人数乘所走行的公里数。
    ?换算吨公里：系延人公里与延吨公里两者之和，为表示铁路的生产量。
    ?中转时间：货车经过中转站，自到达时起至挂出时止，其停站的时间，叫做中转时间。
    ?静载重：为货车在始发站所装的货物吨数，装得愈多，表示静载重提高，从静载重的高低，可以看出来货车是不是满载。
    ?软水工作：即是投软水剂于机车的用水中，使水中所含的矿物质沉淀物软化，减少这些矿物质在锅炉罐板及大小烟管的黏附，即是减少这些矿物质对罐板及烟管的腐蚀及导热不良的作用。
    ?非运用车：凡用以运输各类货物外的货车，如部备用车，占用车，局工事车，专用车，检修车及部所属单位的租用车，均称非运用车。?货运计费吨公里：与延吨公里同，惟因计算运费规定进位成整数的关系，故按计算运费的公里算出。
    ?满载、超轴、五百公里：总的意思即是多装、多拉、快跑。一、满载：铁路运用货车，各有其规定的装载量，所以满载非但要达到规定的货车装载量，而且要不断地改进装车技术，达到节省及经济地使用车辆。二、超轴：又称“超牵引”或“超吨”，即是指某型机车在同一区间内要超过原来规定所拉的列车吨数。（但须有好的操纵技术司机）三、五百公里：从表面上看，好似要求所有机车在二十四小时内都要跑五百公里，实际并不如此。即是指每台机车在二十四小时内在不同线路条件及机车质量下要行驶最高限度的里程。为了快跑，必须提高机车旅行速度、缩短在自外段、站停留时间。由于快跑能节省机车运用台数及费用的支出。
