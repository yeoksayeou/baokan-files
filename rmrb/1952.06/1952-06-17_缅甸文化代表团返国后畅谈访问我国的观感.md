Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Rangoon: The Burmese Cultural Delegation, which visited our country, returned to Rangoon on the 6th. After disembarking, they happily shared their impressions of their visit to China with the welcoming journalists and relatives. U Tun Pe, the head of the delegation, emphasized in his conversation with reporters that China's progress under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the past two years has been rapid. He said that the soaring production enthusiasm of factory workers and farmers after land reform, which can be seen everywhere, fully demonstrates the upward trend of the new China. He praised China's stable prices, abundant domestic goods, and the rapid development of education. He expressed admiration for the Chinese government's establishment of adult spare-time literacy schools and worker-peasant rapid courses. He was particularly amazed by the vastness of the Huai River project and the enthusiastic participation of the masses in the Huai River project. He expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the Chinese government and people, and said: This visit has further promoted the friendship between the two countries and left him with unforgettable memories.

The delegation members shared their most profound impressions. Some said: The most profound impression was seeing adults and children in Chinese cities and villages filled with a new sense of joy; this was very different from what they had heard and imagined in the past. One delegation member said when introducing the Huai River project: I saw a great scene of millions of people working for their future happiness, which is unforgettable in my life. This is a concrete manifestation of the great power of the Chinese people, under the leadership of their own government, devoting themselves to peaceful construction. Some delegation members were particularly interested in the countryside after land reform. They said: After farmers obtained land, not only did their production enthusiasm increase, but also their political and cultural levels improved. Some delegation members felt that it was an honor of a lifetime to have met Chairman Mao.

Furthermore: Yao Zhongming, our ambassador to Burma, hosted a banquet on the 10th to entertain all the members of the delegation. During the banquet, the guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the development of friendship between the people of the two countries to promote peace in Asia.

    缅甸文化代表团返国后畅谈访问我国的观感
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：访问我国的缅甸文化代表团已于六日返抵仰光。他们在下机后即和欢迎他们的记者和亲友们愉快地讲述这次访问中国的观感。团长宇吞帕在对记者的谈话中着重地指出：中国在毛主席的领导下两年来的进步是飞快的。他说，到处都可看到的工厂工人和土地改革后农民的高涨的生产热情，充分表现了新中国蒸蒸向上的气象。他称赞中国的物价稳定、国货充裕和教育事业的迅速发展。他对中国政府设立了成人业余补习学校和工农速成学校表示很钦佩。他特别对治淮工程的浩大和群众参加治淮工程的踊跃，表示惊讶。他对中国政府和人民的热情招待表示感动，并说：这次访问更加促进了两国的友谊，也给自己留下了难忘的印象。
    团员们纷纷发表了他们所得到的最深刻的印象。有些说：在中国的城市和乡村中，看到大人和小孩都充满着新生的愉快的情绪，这印象最为深刻；这也和过去所听到的、所想像的大不相同。一个团员在介绍治淮工程时说：我看到了千千万万的人在为自己将来的幸福而劳动的伟大场面，是一生难忘的，这是中国人民在自己的政府领导下致力于和平建设的伟大力量的具体表现。有些团员对土地改革后的农村特别感到兴趣。他们说：农民获得土地后不仅生产热情提高了，政治、文化水平也提高了。有些团员认为这次得见毛主席是一生的光荣。
    又讯：我驻缅甸大使姚仲明于十日设宴招待该团全体团员，席间宾主们频频举杯，祝贺两国人民友谊的发展以促进亚洲的和平。
