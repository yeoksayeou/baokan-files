Jilin Provincial People's Government General Office Improves Dispatch and Receipt System
Creates Centralized Mail Handling Method

Editor's Note: The centralized mail handling method created and implemented by the Jilin Provincial People's Government General Office can improve work efficiency and save time, manpower, and resources. This is a very good innovation and can be promoted and applied in various regions according to specific circumstances.

Since November 25th of last year, the General Office of the Jilin Provincial People's Government has been piloting a centralized mail handling method. For more than half a year, it has proven that this method can save time, manpower, and financial resources, and improve work efficiency. The twenty-five units directly under the Jilin Provincial People's Government are scattered in various districts of Jilin City. In the past, a large number of incoming and outgoing letters were sent by the messengers of each unit; often the messengers of each unit had to run all over the city, and even then, urgent letters were sometimes delayed (for example, if the sending unit had only one messenger, the same letter would be sent to many units, and the last few units would receive it after the deadline). At the same time, when messengers delivered letters, they had to take the letters out of their bags at each unit, so the phenomenon of lost letters often occurred. This method of communication and dispatch was a great waste in terms of manpower, material resources, and time. During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaign, the General Office of the Jilin Provincial People's Government studied this situation and held a meeting of messengers from various units to discuss it. Finally, unified dispatch and receipt registers were printed, and a "Centralized Dispatch and Receipt Station" was established, stipulating that every day at 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., the messengers of each unit should bring the letters to be sent out by their unit to the "Centralized Dispatch and Receipt Station" for exchange. (The most urgent letters from each unit are sent by special personnel.) When messengers from each unit send out letters at the "Centralized Dispatch and Receipt Station," they also collect various letters from other units to their own unit. The specific method is: for example, if the first receiving unit is the Finance Department, the messengers of each unit hand over the letters for the Finance Department to the messenger of the Finance Department; the messenger of the Finance Department then hands over the letters to be sent when receiving letters at another unit. Initially, twenty-five units exchanged an average of more than 200 letters each time, taking 30 to 40 minutes. Now, more than 30 units participate in the centralized dispatch and receipt, and the exchange time has been reduced to 20 to 25 minutes. The phenomenon of accumulated letters and lost letters has disappeared.

Implementing this method saves time, manpower, and financial resources, and improves work efficiency. The twenty-five units directly under the Jilin Provincial People's Government have reduced six messengers. For example, the General Office of the Jilin Provincial People's Government originally had seven messengers who sent letters from morning to night, and sometimes letters were still accumulated; after implementing this method, three messengers were immediately transferred to do other work, and the remaining four people did the work of seven people, and there was still plenty of time. On average, the thirty-four messengers from the original twenty-five units worked eight hours a day, but now twenty-eight messengers complete the work in four hours a day, saving about 70% of manpower, and also shortening the letter delivery time. The messengers of each unit rode bicycles to deliver letters. In the past, they ran non-stop every day, but now they only run twice a day, which can extend the "life" of bicycles and greatly reduce bicycle repair costs. Due to the centralized exchange of letters, the messengers of each unit directly handle the dispatch and receipt procedures with the internal dispatch and receipt (clerks), eliminating the registration process for external dispatch and receipt. Implementing this method also strengthens the messengers' sense of responsibility. In the past, when messengers delivered letters, they only delivered the letters. Now, messengers also serve as external dispatch and receipt personnel, not only sending out letters, but also collecting incoming letters and stamping the dispatch register of other units to be responsible. After the Jilin Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau implemented this method, it reduced external dispatch and receipt personnel. Implementing this method also allows messengers to play the role of expediting official documents. In the past, clerks sometimes procrastinated in their work; now that the letter dispatch time is fixed, the messengers go to urge them when it is time to dispatch letters, so the clerk's work has also become more tense. In the past, messengers did not have time to study due to their busy work. After implementing this method, they can study on time every day and can also do some other work. (Shi Guo)

    吉林省人民政府办公厅改进收发制度
    创造集中收发信件办法
    编者按：吉林省人民政府办公厅所创造和实行的集中收发信件的办法，是可以提高工作效率，节省时间、人力、物力的。这是一个很好的创造，各地可根据具体情况，推广应用。
    吉林省人民政府办公厅自去年十一月二十五日起试行集中收发信件的办法。半年多来，证明这种办法可以节省时间、人力、财力，和提高工作效率。吉林省人民政府直属的二十五个单位，分散在吉林市各区。过去，每天大批来往信件，都是由各单位的通信员送出；往往每个单位的通信员要跑遍全市，就这样有时还耽误了紧急的信件（如发信单位只有一个通信员，同样的信件送往很多单位，送到最后几个单位就过了时间）。同时，通信员送信时，每到一个单位，都得从背包往外拿信，因此丢失信件的现象也时常发生。这种通信和收发的方法，在人力、物力和时间等方面，都有很大的浪费。在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，吉林省人民政府办公厅研究了这种情况，并召开了各单位通信员会议进行讨论，最后印制了统一的收发文簿，设立“集中收发站”，规定每天午前十点钟和午后三点钟，各单位通信员携带本单位往外发的信件，到“集中收发站”交换。（各单位最紧急的信就另派专人送。）每个单位的通信员在“集中收发站”发出信件同时，收回其他单位交本单位的各种信件。具体办法是：例如第一个收信单位是财政厅，各单位的通信员把给财政厅的信都交给财政厅的通信员；财政厅的通信员则在另一单位收信时交出要发的信件。最初二十五个单位，平均每次交换二百多封信，用三十分钟到四十分钟的时间。现在参加集中收发的三十多个单位，交换时间已减少到二十分钟至二十五分钟。积压信件和丢失信件的现象已经消失。
    实行这种办法，节省了时间、人力和财力，提高了工作效率。吉林省人民政府直属二十五个单位，已经减少了六个通信员。如吉林省人民政府办公厅原有七个通信员，从早到晚送信，有时还积压信件；实行这个办法以后，马上就抽调三名通信员做其他工作，剩下的四个人做七个人的事情，时间还充裕。平均算来：过去二十五个单位的三十四个通信员，每人每天八小时的工作，现在二十八个通信员，每人每天四小时就做完了，节省了约百分之七十的人力，还缩短了送信时间。各单位的通信员送信时，都骑自行车，过去每天不停地跑，现在每天只跑两趟，可延长自行车的“寿命”，自行车修理费也大大减少了。由于集中交换信件，各单位通信员直接和内收发（文书）办理收发手续，取消了外收发的登记过程。实行这种办法，也加强了通信员的责任心。过去通信员送信时，只把信件送去。现在通信员兼做了外收发，不但把往外发的信送去，同时还把收的信收来，并在别的单位发文簿上盖章负责。吉林省人民政府劳动局在实行这种办法之后，减去了外收发人员。实行这种办法，通信员还能起公文催办员的作用。过去文书有时工作拖拉；现在发信时间固定了，到发信的时候，通信员就去催，所以文书工作也随着紧张起来。过去通信员由于工作忙，没有学习时间，实行了这个办法以后，每天都能按时学习，并且还可以做些其他的工作。（石果）
