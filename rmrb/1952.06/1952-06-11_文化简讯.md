    ▲ In order to meet the needs of the working people, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government is building a large park covering 225 mu in the People's Square in the center of Shanghai. The construction project began on the 4th and is expected to be completed around National Day this year. The park will have a concert hall, swimming pool, sports field, rest pavilions, and children's playground, and will be planted with various flowers, plants and trees. The scale of this newly built park is second only to Zhongshan Park in Shanghai. (Note: People's Square was formerly a "racecourse," a piece of land seized by British imperialists during the Taiping Rebellion by relying on their military force and turned into a place for horse racing and gambling. The Shanghai Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army ordered the land to be taken back last August at the request of the people.)
    ▲ The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing established a factory-wide Speedy Literacy Method Promotion Committee on May 10th. The committee has initially recruited more than 300 employees from various departments with different work natures and work hours to form nine Speedy Literacy classes for key experiments, in order to gain experience and prepare for the future promotion of the employee literacy campaign throughout the factory. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Department of Culture and Education of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have sent specialists to the factory to assist in the work.

    ▲上海市人民政府为了适应劳动人民的需要，正在上海市中心区人民广场内修辟一个占地二百二十五市亩的大公园。该项建筑工程已在四日开始，预期在今年国庆节前后完工。公园内将有音乐厅、游泳池、运动场、休息亭及儿童游戏场，并种植各种花草树木。这个新辟公园的规模，在上海，仅次于中山公园（按人民广场前为“跑马厅”，系在太平天国革命时期英帝国主义者依靠其武力霸占下来，辟为跑马赌博场所的土地。中国人民解放军上海市军事管制委员会已在去年八月间根据人民的要求，下令将该地收回）。
    ▲北京石景山钢铁厂已于五月十日成立全厂推行速成识字法工作委员会。该委员会已在全厂各工作性质和工作时间不同的部门，先吸收三百多名职工，成立了九个速成识字班作重点试验，以吸取经验，为将来在全厂推行职工识字运动作准备。中央人民政府教育部、中华全国总工会文教部均派专人在该厂协助工作。
