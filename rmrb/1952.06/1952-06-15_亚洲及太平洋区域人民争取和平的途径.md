As a member of the World Peace Council and President of Peking University, Ma Yinchu states:

    The American imperialists, manipulating their satellite states, have established more than 500 military bases to encircle the countries of the peaceful and democratic camp and prepare for new wars of aggression. Although this is a desperate attempt, it poses a serious threat to the peace and security of the people of the world, especially those in Asia and the Pacific region. The American imperialists’ unilateral conclusion of the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan, the revival of Japanese militarism, the use of inhumane bacteriological weapons, the brutal massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and the deliberate sabotage of the Korean armistice negotiations are all maintaining international tensions and plotting to incite a new world war. The Burmese representative at the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference said: "We, the people of Burma, who personally experienced World War II, no longer believe that imperialism will protect our property and our country. Imperialists cannot be friends of people who want to live in peace and engage in mutual exchange, no matter how they disguise themselves, people will always recognize them as enemies." Representatives from various countries share this sentiment.

    American imperialism is undermining the economies of its satellite states everywhere in the name of "American aid." The Philippine representative said: "The Filipino people are tired of American Coca-Cola, nylon, lipstick, and pornographic literature and films." This is a typical example of "American aid." Last year, India faced a famine and urgently needed grain. Canada, however, had a large amount of unsold wheat piled up in barns as "defense preparations." Many peaceful economic enterprises in American imperialism and its satellite states have suffered deeply due to the blockade and embargo of "strategic materials." The Indonesian representative said: "Since the American imperialists implemented the embargo in June 1951, the price of domestically produced fireworks film (referring to natural film) has fallen from 11 rupiahs to 3.5 rupiahs per kilogram." The Malayan representative said: "After the price of rubber in Malaya fell due to the embargo, exports decreased and production shrank. According to official British figures, Malaya's rubber exports in January this year were 21,000 tons less than in December last year, and last year's rubber production was 90,000 tons less than the previous year." How could the suffering of the people not deepen! The Japanese people, enslaved and bankrupted by the American occupation authorities, are driven to desperation and starvation, and sell their children. In 1951 alone, 300,000 children were sold in Japan. It is unbearable to hear. The Japanese representative said: "According to Japanese government statistics, the average daily food intake for a Japanese man should be 2,500 calories. In reality, in 1951, it was only 1,089 calories." The Mexican representative said: "The American government is forcing our national economy to develop in a direction that does not conform to the interests of the people. They are also plundering our country's resources, which cannot be compensated, and continue to deepen our country's economic and political dependence on North American monopoly capitalists. This has led to a continuous rise in the cost of living, which has brought serious consequences to our people who are already facing them." This is a representative situation.

    American imperialism and its servants have long used the deceptive tactics of narrow nationalism, attempting to create friction, jealousy, and suspicion among various ethnic groups in order to facilitate the rule and enslavement of the imperialists. They promote the superiority of the Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon nations, discriminate against people of color, in order to anesthetize the people under their rule, implement barbaric rule, and suppress the national liberation movements of oppressed nations. They trample on and destroy the national treasures of the local people. Today, they are doing everything possible to slander the increasingly powerful countries of the peaceful and democratic camp, and of course, there is no talk of cultural exchange.

    The threat of American imperialism to peace is intolerable to every peace-loving person. The Chinese people have deeply experienced the pain inflicted on us by imperialist wars of aggression. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have struggled arduously for more than 30 years and have been liberated from the abyss of suffering, and have become the masters of an independent, free, democratic, peaceful, and happy country. There are clear provisions in the Common Program for foreign affairs, commerce, and ethnic policies: upholding lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and war (Article 54); restoring and developing commercial and trade relations with the governments and people of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit (Article 57); all ethnic groups within China are equal, practicing unity and mutual assistance, opposing imperialism and the people's enemies within all ethnic groups (Article 50). In the past two or three years, our country has implemented the above policies and has achieved brilliant results. The people of Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya are also rising up to fight with a firm belief in victory. The Korean representative said: "The awakened people of Asia are no longer willing to live under the shackles of imperialism. We, the Korean people, would rather die in battle than live as slaves of a colony." With such firm will of the people, is there any fear of not being able to win? The heroic struggle of the Korean people over the past two years has made a huge contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

    To strive for peace, we must unify our will, concentrate our strength, and wage a tenacious struggle against the enemies of peace. To strive for peace, we cannot fight alone, we must unite all peace-loving people of all countries, and advance in an organized and led manner. To strive for peace, we need to grasp the specific situation, vigilantly and patiently carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda, so that everyone can understand the true meaning of democratic peace, and only then can unity be consolidated.

    The 1.6 billion people of Asia and the Pacific region, united like steel under the banner of defending peace, hold peace tightly in our hands. A handful of aggressors will become like bound beasts, and even if they want war, it will be impossible! Therefore, war can be stopped. It only remains for us to work together.

    亚洲及太平洋区域人民争取和平的途径
    世界和平理事会理事  北京大学校长  马寅初
    美帝国主义操纵着它的仆从国，建立起军事基地五百个以上，来包围和平民主阵营的国家，作新的侵略战争的准备。这虽然是绝望的企图，可是给与世界人民，尤其亚洲和太平洋地区人民的和平与安全的威胁，却是很严重的。美帝国主义片面地缔结美日旧金山“和约”，复活日本军国主义，使用灭绝人性的细菌武器，惨无人道地虐杀朝中战俘，蓄意破坏朝鲜的停战谈判等一系列的暴行，都在维持国际紧张的局势，阴谋煽起新的世界战争。这次出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的缅甸代表说：“我们亲身经历过第二次世界大战的缅甸人民，不再相信帝国主义会保障我们的财产和祖国。帝国主义者不可能是我们安居乐业互相往来的人们的朋友，不管它如何伪装，人们总认识到它是敌人。”各国的代表都有同感。
    美帝国主义到处以“美援”的美名，破坏仆从国的经济。菲律宾代表说：“菲律宾人民已厌倦美国的可口可乐、尼龙、口红以及色情文学和电影。”这是“美援”的典型。去年印度饥荒，迫切需要粮食。而加拿大有大量卖不出去的小麦作为“国防准备”堆积在谷仓里。美帝国主义及其仆从国家许多和平经济事业，因封锁和禁运“战略物资”的缘故，遭受了深重的创伤。印尼代表说：“印尼自一九五一年六月美帝国主义实行禁运以来，自造烟花片（指天然胶片）每公斤的价格自十一盾落到三·五盾。”马来亚代表说：“马来亚的橡胶因禁运而价格下跌之后，输出下降，生产缩减，据英国官方公布今年一月马来亚的橡胶输出比去年十二月少二万一千吨，而去年橡胶的产量则较前年少九万吨。”人民的苦痛怎么会不加深呢！被美国占领军当局奴役着和破产了的日本人们，被绝望和饥饿逼上了最后的绝路，出卖自己的儿女。单是一九五一年一年中，在日本就出卖了三十万个儿童。惨不忍闻。日本代表说：“根据日本政府的统计，日本一个男子每日食量平均要有二千五百卡路里的发热量。但在实际上，在一九五一年，才只有一○八九卡。”墨西哥代表说：“美国政府迫使我们的国家经济向着不符合于国民利益的道路发展，他们还掠夺我们国家的资源，这些资源是不可能补偿的了，并且继续加深我们国家对北美独占资本家经济上与政治上的依赖，这样就引起了生活费不断上涨，给我们人民带来了已经面临的严重的后果。”这是富有代表性的情况。
    美帝国主义及其仆从长期使用狭隘的民族主义的欺骗手段，企图造成各族人民相互磨擦、嫉妒和猜忌，以便利于帝国主义者的统治和奴役。他们宣传条顿、盎格鲁撒克逊民族的优越，歧视有色人种，以麻醉其统治权力下的人民，实行野蛮的统治，镇压被压迫民族的民族解放运动。蹂躏和毁坏当地人民的民族瑰宝。他们今天更对日益壮大的和平民主阵营国家，毁谤无所不用其极，当然更说不上文化交流了。
    美帝国主义对和平的威胁是每一个爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。中国人民更深深体验到帝国主义侵略战争所给与我们的痛苦。在共产党和毛主席英明领导下，我们艰苦奋斗三十余年，已从苦难的深渊中解放出来了，并且已做了独立自由民主和平和幸福国家的主人了。对于外交、通商和民族政策，在共同纲领上都有明确规定：拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策（第五十四条）；在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系（第五十七条）；中国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌（第五十条）。二三年来我国执行上述政策已收到光辉灿烂的成绩。朝鲜、越南、马来亚等国人民，也都抱着必胜的信心起来斗争。朝鲜代表说：“已觉醒的亚洲人民再不愿在帝国主义的束缚下过活，我们朝鲜人民宁可作战而死，绝对不愿意再当殖民地亡国奴而求活。”人民有了这样坚决意志，还怕不能胜利吗？两年来朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，已为保卫世界和平的事业作了巨大的贡献。
    要争取和平，必须统一意志，集中力量，对和平的敌人作顽强的斗争；争取和平也不能孤军奋斗，必须团结各国一切爱好和平的人们，有组织有领导地前进；争取和平需要掌握具体情况，机警地，耐心地展开广泛而深入的宣传，使人人皆认识民主和平的真意义，团结才能巩固。
    亚洲和太平洋区域十六万万人民，在保卫和平的旗帜下，团结成钢铁一般的坚硬，和平就紧握在我们的手里。一小撮的侵略者将变成像被捆着的野兽，想要战争，也不可能了！故战争是可以制止的。只待我们共同去努力。
