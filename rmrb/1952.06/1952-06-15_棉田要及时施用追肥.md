    Timely Application of Topdressing Fertilizer to Cotton Fields
    Using more fertilizer and applying it appropriately are important steps in increasing cotton yield per unit area. Last winter and this spring, the broad masses of farmers launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign, and cooperatives also supplied large quantities of commercial fertilizer. Therefore, the amount of base fertilizer applied by farmers this year has greatly increased compared to last year, and the phenomenon of cotton fields not being fertilized has been basically eliminated. However, many cotton fields still have too little fertilizer applied today, and some cotton farmers are still afraid that applying too much fertilizer will cause the cotton to "go crazy"; there are also some cotton farmers who blindly and inappropriately apply too much fertilizer. These are all mistakes. Now, the season for applying topdressing fertilizer to cotton fields has arrived. Organizing cotton farmers to universally apply topdressing fertilizer and providing correct technical guidance is an urgent task for agricultural leadership at all levels.
    The purpose of applying topdressing fertilizer is to supplement the insufficient strength of the base fertilizer during the fastest growth and greatest fertilizer requirement of cotton, so that the cotton can develop normally. Therefore, when applying topdressing fertilizer, be sure to choose fast-acting fertilizers.
    The application of topdressing fertilizer should be carried out in stages (generally three times is sufficient) according to the development of cotton seedlings and soil fertility conditions, so as to continuously supply the cotton seedlings with sufficient nutrients. Topdressing should be completed before the full flowering of cotton plants (the full flowering period of cotton plants in the north is around mid-July). After the cotton plants are in full bloom or boll formation, it is not advisable to apply topdressing fertilizer again, so as to avoid excessive vegetative growth and delayed boll opening.
    Attention should also be paid to the amount of fertilizer used. Too little or too much fertilizer will not result in high yields. Topdressing fertilizer should be applied in moderation, and should not be used blindly and in large quantities. The fertilizer application experience of Qu Yaoli, Liang Jiarui and others can be used as a reference.

### 棉田要及时施用追肥

    棉田要及时施用追肥
    多用肥料和适当地施用肥料，是提高棉花单位面积产量的重要环节。去冬和今春，广大农民开展了积肥运动，合作社又大量供应商品肥料，因此，今年农民施用的基肥，已比去年大大增加，棉田不施肥的现象，基本上已经不存在了。但是，很多棉田，今天施肥的数量还嫌太少，有些棉农还怕施肥多了棉花会“疯”；也有部分棉农，盲目地不适当地多施肥料。这些都是错误的。现在，棉田施用追肥的季节已经到来，组织棉农普遍地施用追肥，并进行正确的技术指导，这是各级农业领导机关的一个迫切任务。
    施用追肥的目的，是在棉花生育最快、需肥最多的时候，补助基肥力量的不足，以便使棉花得到正常的发育。因此，施用追肥，一定要选用速效的肥料。
    施用追肥应该根据棉苗发育情况和地力情况，分期进行（一般三次即可），以便源源供应棉苗以足够的养分。追肥要在棉株盛花以前施用完毕（北方棉株盛花期约在七月中旬），棉株盛花或结铃以后，不宜再施追肥，以免贪青狂长，延迟开絮。
    肥料的用量也要注意。施肥太少和太多，都不能丰产。施用追肥应该适量，不可盲目地大量地使用。曲耀离、梁家瑞等人的施肥经验，是可以参考的。
