Cultural Briefs

    ▲ The theoretical instructor training class held by the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee, which began on October 25th of last year, concluded on May 21st of this year. The Provincial Committee has decided that all graduates will engage in theoretical education work for the long term, to gradually improve their political, ideological, and professional levels and lay the foundation for future formal theoretical education work.
    The class selected and studied the main works of Chairman Mao in various periods, with "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" by Hu Qiaomu as the main teaching material. After the start of the "Three-Anti" campaign, courses such as "The Relationship Between the Party and the Bourgeoisie" and "Theories and Policies of Economic Construction" were added. As a result of the study, not only the political, ideological, and theoretical level of all trainees were improved, and key personnel for leading theoretical study were cultivated, but also experience in studying the history of the Party was gained.
    ▲ The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has collaborated with the preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Central-South Region and the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to focus on piloting accelerated literacy education experimental classes in the private-owned Shenxin Textile Factory and Fuxin Flour Mill.
    ▲ The Subei Industrial and Agricultural Spare-Time Education Committee will vigorously promote the "Accelerated Literacy Method" in the region. The committee has planned to first focus on piloting accelerated literacy experimental classes in sixteen counties and cities, including Yangzhou, Nantong, Taizhou, and Rugao, and then promote it universally after gaining experience. In rural areas, it plans to vigorously promote it during the slack farming season this winter and next spring.
    ▲ The Southwest Region Preparatory Office of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, together with relevant departments, formed a safety and health inspection team. Recently, along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, they used mobile screenings of slides, photo exhibitions, and forums to publicize and inspect safety and health work, which was very effective.

    ▲中共平原省委举办的理论教员训练班，自去年十月二十五日开学，已于今年五月二十一日结束。省委决定全体毕业学员今后长期从事理论教育工作，以逐渐提高自己的政治、思想和业务水平，为今后正规理论教育工作打下基础。
    该班选读了毛主席各个时期的主要著作，而以胡乔木著“中国共产党的三十年”为学习的主要教材。“三反”开始后并增添了“党与资产阶级的关系”和“经济建设的理论与政策”等课程。学习的结果，不仅提高了全体学员的政治、思想和理论水平，培养了领导理论学习的骨干，并取得了学习党史的经验。
    ▲武汉市文教局已协同中南总工会筹委会、武汉市总工会在私营申新纱厂、福新面粉厂重点试办速成识字教育实验班。
