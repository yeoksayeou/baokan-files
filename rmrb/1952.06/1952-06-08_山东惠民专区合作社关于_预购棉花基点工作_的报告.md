    Report on "Advance Purchase of Cotton Base Point Work" by the Huimin Special District Cooperative of Shandong
    Li Qinglin
    In order to do a good job in this year's cotton advance purchase work, the Huimin Special District Cooperative of Shandong Province transferred a number of cadres and formed a work team with the Huimin County United Cooperative to conduct a typical experiment in advance purchase of cotton in Zhaotian Township, Second District, Huimin County. From April 18th to 23rd, the entire advance purchase work was successfully completed in six days.
    Zhaotian Township includes four villages: Xiaoguojia, Chengjia, Zhaotian, and Caojia. The township has a total of 172 households and planted 840 mu of cotton this year, with an estimated total cotton production of 261,000 jin. The township has thirteen mutual aid teams and an agricultural production cooperative (Xiaoguojia Village) comprising fifty households; most of these cooperative mutual aid organizations were established this spring. They have all formulated detailed production plans, and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production.
    At the beginning of the advance purchase work in the township, the work team first convened village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and model farmers to conduct patriotic production education, especially emphasizing the great significance of credit advance purchase of cotton. The village cadres had an insufficient understanding of the shortcomings in last year's advance purchase of cotton work, and many still had a blindly optimistic attitude of "advance purchase is not difficult, it can be achieved with just a word." They said, "This is not asking the masses for things, what's so difficult about it?" In addition, at that time it was the planting season, and the village was very busy, so the village cadres did not seriously do the advance purchase work. In this case, the work team conducted specific education for the village cadres and held mass meetings in each village to listen to the opinions of the masses. The masses were not satisfied with the cooperative's cotton inspection and grading last year. They believed that the same cotton could be sold at two different prices because the cooperative's purchasing personnel looked at it differently. The masses were also not satisfied with the cooperative's failure to fulfill the advance purchase contract last year. In addition, they also raised opinions about the cooperative's untimely supply of goods and the poor work style of some cadres. In this way, many cadres realized that to do a good job in this year's advance purchase of cotton, they must seriously overcome the shortcomings in their own work and conduct meticulous publicity and organization work among the masses.
    The masses in Zhaotian Township also had some incorrect views and concerns about the advance purchase work. For example, they were afraid of trouble, afraid of not being free after signing the contract, and afraid of not being able to fulfill the contract in the event of a poor harvest. In addition, some cotton farmers hoped that the cooperative would implement advance sales on credit and advance payment of grain.
    In response to these thoughts of the masses, the work team carried out publicity and education, explaining the benefits of advance purchase of cotton from the perspectives of the state's easy control of cotton and the farmers' timely access to material supplies, dispelling the masses' concerns. Cao Dianrong, a cotton farmer in Caojia Village, said, "This is good for the country and the people. We can sign a guarantee contract before planting the land, so we can work hard with peace of mind." The work team also mobilized cotton farmers to sign contracts with the cooperative as much as possible through credit advance sales. Because the reasons were explained clearly, only a few more difficult households in the four villages borrowed 750 jin of bean cake from the cooperative on credit. Mutual aid team members said, "The country currently needs to resist the United States and aid Korea and carry out construction, so as long as we have a little way, we should not ask the country to pay advance deposits." The Xiaoguojia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative needed 60,000 jin of bean cake, all of which was purchased from the cooperative.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the work, the cooperative made a deep self-criticism among the masses regarding the failure to earnestly fulfill the advance purchase contract last year and the shortcomings in the work style of the cooperative cadres, and expressed its determination to correct them. Detailed answers were given to the problems of unfair cotton grading and untimely supply of goods, explaining that as long as the cooperative corrected the shortcomings in its work, similar deviations would no longer occur. Regarding the issue of poor harvests, the masses were told that the advance purchase contract is one of the effective ways to ensure that cotton farmers achieve their production plans; if the contract cannot be fulfilled due to irresistible disasters, then it cannot be forced. In this way, the cotton farmers were all satisfied, and their confidence in production was greatly enhanced. They all signed advance purchase contracts with the cooperative with peace of mind.
    The cooperative only spent two days signing contracts in Zhaotian Township. It signed a contract with the Xiaoguojia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, purchasing 150,000 jin of seed cotton in advance; it signed seven contracts with the seven mutual aid teams in Caojia Village, purchasing 33,758 jin of seed cotton in advance; it signed five contracts with the four mutual aid teams and one member group in Zhaotian Village, purchasing 21,840 jin of seed cotton in advance; and it signed four contracts with the four mutual aid teams in Chengjia Village, purchasing 14,930 jin of seed cotton in advance. In total, the cooperative purchased more than 220,000 jin of seed cotton in advance in the entire township, averaging 86 percent of the total output (Editor's Note: In order to enable cotton farmers to pay this year's cotton tax and retain a portion for their own use, the average amount of cotton purchased in advance by cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas should not exceed 60 percent of the local total cotton production). These contracts were basically signed using the credit advance purchase method. In addition, the Xiaoguojia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative also pre-ordered 30 bolts of fine cloth and 130,000 jin of grain from the supply and marketing cooperative.
    The advance purchase of cotton work in Zhaotian Township fully demonstrates that the policy of implementing credit advance purchase is correct and acceptable to the masses. Some cadres believe that credit advance purchase will not work because they have not really gone deep into the masses to consult with them, but instead are blindly shouting slogans from above. This work style must be changed, otherwise the policy of focusing on credit advance purchase cannot be realized when purchasing cotton in advance.
    Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are the solid mass base of supply and marketing cooperatives, which has been further proven in the advance purchase of cotton work. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives should concentrate their efforts on signing advance purchase contracts with them. In this way, the problems of product sales, means of production, and living supplies of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams can be solved, enabling them to expand reproduction; supply and marketing cooperatives can also truly avoid blindness in their operations and embark on planned management, thereby further achieving consolidation and development.

### 山东惠民专区合作社关于“预购棉花基点工作”的报告

    山东惠民专区合作社关于“预购棉花基点工作”的报告
    李青林
    山东省惠民专区合作社为了作好今年的棉花预购工作，曾抽调一部分干部，和惠民县联合社共同组成工作组，在惠民县二区昭田乡进行了预购棉花典型试验。从四月十八日到二十三日的六天当中，全部预购工作已顺利完成。
    昭田乡包括小郭家、程家、昭田、曹家四村，全乡共有一百七十二户，今年共植棉八百四十亩，预计棉花总产量为二十六万一千斤。全乡有十三个互助组和一个包括五十户（小郭家村）的农业生产合作社；这些合作互助组织大部分都是今年春天才建立起来的。它们都订有详细的生产计划，群众的生产情绪很高。
    该乡预购工作开始时，工作组首先召集了村干部、互助组长、丰产模范开会，进行爱国丰产的教育，特别强调了信用预购棉花的重大意义。该村干部由于对去年预购棉花工作中的缺点认识不足，还有不少人有“预购不难，一说即成”的盲目乐观情绪。他们说：“这又不是向群众要东西，有什么难呢？”再加上当时正值播种时期，村里工作很忙，所以村干部并没有认真地做预购工作。在这种情况下，工作组又对村干部进行了具体教育，并在各村分头召开群众大会，听取群众意见。群众对合作社去年收棉验级不满意。他们认为，同样的棉花因合作社收购人员一眼看高一眼看低，就能卖出两样价钱来。群众对合作社去年没有履行预购合同也不满意。此外，对合作社供应货物不及时以及部分干部工作作风不好，也都提出了意见。这样一来，就使很多干部认识到要做好今年的预购棉花工作，就必须认真克服本身工作上的缺点，并向群众进行细致的宣传、组织工作。
    昭田乡的群众对预购工作还有一些不正确的看法和顾虑。例如，怕麻烦，怕订合同后不自由，怕歉收时不能履行合同等等。此外，还有部分棉农希望合作社实行赊销预购，预付粮食。
    工作组针对群众这些思想，进行了宣传教育，从国家便于掌握棉花和农民能及时得到物资供应等方面，说明预购棉花的好处，打破了群众的顾虑。曹家村棉农曹殿荣说：“这对国家对人民都有好处，地还没种就打下保证合同，可以放心使劲地干了。”工作组并动员棉农尽量以信用预售的方式，和合作社订立合同。由于把道理说清楚了，所以四个村只有几个较困难户，向合作社赊了七百五十斤豆饼。互助组员说：“国家目前既要抗美援朝，又要进行建设，我们只要有点办法，就不应要国家预付定金。”小郭家村的农业生产合作社需六万斤豆饼，完全是在合作社现购的。
    为了使工作能够顺利进行，合作社对去年没有认真履行预购合同的情况以及对合作社干部作风的缺点，都在群众中做了深刻检讨，并表明改正的决心。对棉花分级不公、供应货物不及时等问题，都做了详细解答，说明只要合作社改正了工作中的缺点，就可不再发生类似偏差。关于歉收的问题，向群众说明预购合同就是保证棉农实现生产计划的有效方法之一；如因受到不可抗拒的灾害以致不能履行合同时，那也不能勉强。这样一来，棉农都感到满意，生产信心也大大提高了。他们都放心地和合作社签订了预购合同。
    合作社在昭田乡订立合同的时间只用了两天。计和小郭家村农业生产合作社订了一份合同，预购籽棉十五万斤；和曹家村七个互助组订了七份合同，预购籽棉三万三千七百五十八斤；和昭田村四个互助组、一个社员小组订了五份合同，预购籽棉二万一千八百四十斤；和程家村四个互助组订了四份合同，预购籽棉一万四千九百三十斤。总计合作社在全乡共预购籽棉二十二万多斤，平均占总产量的百分之八十六（编者按：为了使棉农能缴纳今年的赋棉，并留一部分自用，各产棉区合作社预购棉花的数量，平均应以不超过当地棉花总产量的百分之六十较为适宜）。这些合同基本上都是采用信用预购方式订立。此外，小郭家村农业生产合作社还向供销合作社预订了细布三十匹、粮食十三万斤。
    昭田乡的预购棉花工作充分说明了实行信用预购的方针是正确的，是群众能够接受的。一部分干部认为信用预购行不通，那是因为他们并没有真正深入群众，和群众商量，而是高高在上的盲目空喊。这种作风必须转变，否则在预购棉花时就不能实现以信用预购为主的方针。
    农业生产合作社、互助组是供销合作社坚固的群众基础，这一点在预购棉花工作中得到了进一步的证明。因此，供销合作社应当集中力量和他们订好预购合同。这样，农业生产合作社、互助组的产品推销、生产资料和生活资料供应问题得以解决，能够扩大再生产；供销合作社也可以真正避免业务上的盲目性，走上计划经营，从而进一步达到巩固和发展。
