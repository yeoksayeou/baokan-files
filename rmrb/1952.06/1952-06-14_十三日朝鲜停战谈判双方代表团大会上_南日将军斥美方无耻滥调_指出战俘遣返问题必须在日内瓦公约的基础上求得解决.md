Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 13th: At the thirteenth session of the Korean Armistice Negotiations between the two delegations, the US Chief Delegate once again put forward his proposal as a "firm, final, and unchangeable" platitude, attempting to threaten our side into accepting its plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Our Chief Delegate, General Nam Il, pointed out: The other side has not achieved a dominant position on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. The other side's naive threatening attitude will not have any effect and will not help solve the problem. General Nam Il reiterated: Our side has made many major efforts on the issue of POW repatriation and has put forward a plan to enable POWs on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives. Our plan is fully in line with the Geneva Convention, is fair and reasonable to both sides, and is a plan that can truly resolve the POW repatriation issue. The other side's plan to forcibly detain POWs directly violates the Geneva Convention and is completely unreasonable. The POW repatriation issue must be resolved reasonably based on the Geneva Convention. The next step in the negotiations is entirely up to the other side. The full text of General Nam Il's speech is as follows:

    "I must remind you again that your side is not in a position to dictate everything, whether on the battlefield or at the negotiating table. I believe that the sooner your side realizes this, the sooner the Korean armistice will arrive. Your side's unilateral plan of April 28 to forcibly detain our captured personnel is a direct violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention and is completely unreasonable. The 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that after the cessation of hostilities, prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay. Since prisoners of war are captives of the opposing party and are under protection, the receiving party is responsible for everything. The Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war shall not, under any circumstances, renounce their right to repatriation. Your so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' so-called 'screening,' and 'joint re-screening' are all direct violations of the Geneva Convention and are completely unreasonable. Your side cannot make your unilateral and unreasonable plan sound reasonable or fair, but you repeatedly claim that your plan is 'firm, final, and unchangeable,' and that you will not make any concessions to force our side to accept your plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel. I must point out that your childish behavior is of no help in solving the problem. Since the discussion of the issue of POW repatriation began, our side has made many major efforts and put forward a reasonable and compromise plan to enable POWs on both sides to immediately return home and live peaceful lives. Our plan is fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Convention. Our plan is fair and reasonable to both sides. At the same time, I must repeat that this is a plan that can truly solve the problem. However, on the issue of POW repatriation, your side has not only consistently adhered to your unilateral and unreasonable demands without making any concessions, but has also openly reneged on your spokesperson's explicit promise to resolve the issue within the framework of the plan to repatriate 132,000 of our prisoners of war, and put forward the April 28 plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel, which has widened the differences between the two sides that could have been narrowed. Your side's perfidious behavior, unilateral and unreasonable demands, and arbitrary attitude are absolutely intolerable to our side. In this equal negotiation between the two sides, any issue must be resolved through consultation on a reasonable basis. In order to realize the armistice in Korea, our side has made many major efforts on the issue of POW repatriation and put forward the fair and reasonable plan of May 2, which is fully in line with the Geneva Convention. The POW repatriation issue must be resolved on the basis of the universally recognized Geneva Convention. Our side firmly believes that our May 2 compromise plan is the only reasonable basis for solving the problem. The next step in the negotiations is entirely up to your side, unless your side does not want an armistice in Korea at all, or your fundamental purpose is to continue the Korean War, thereby deliberately refusing to resolve the POW repatriation issue."

    十三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    南日将军斥美方无耻滥调
    指出战俘遣返问题必须在日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决
    【新华社开城十三日电】十三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，美方首席代表再次提出其方案为“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”滥调，妄图威胁我方接受其强行扣留战俘的方案。我方首席代表南日将军指出：对方不论在战场或会场上都没有取得独断一切的地位，对方幼稚的威胁态度不能产生任何作用，也无助于问题的解决。南日将军再次指出：我方在战俘遣返问题上已经作了多次重大努力，提出了使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的方案。我方方案完全符合于日内瓦公约，对双方公平合理，是真正能解决战俘遣返问题的方案。对方强行扣留战俘的方案，直接违反了日内瓦公约，是完全不合理的。战俘遣返问题必须在日内瓦公约的基础上取得合理解决。谈判的下一步完全在于对方。南日将军发言全文如下：
    “我必须再次提醒你，无论在战场上或是会场上，你方都不是处于独断一切的地位。我以为你方早一天认识到这一点，朝鲜停战就会早一天到来。你方强行扣留我方被俘人员的四月二十八日片面方案，是直接地违反了一九四九年的日内瓦公约，是完全不合理的。一九四九年的日内瓦公约，明确规定敌对行为终止后，战俘应予释放并遣返，不得迟延。由于战俘系处于敌对一方的俘虏和保护下，一切由收容一方负责。日内瓦公约规定战俘在任何情况下，都不得声明放弃遣返的权利。你方所谓‘自愿遣返’，所谓‘甄别’和‘联合再甄别’，都是直接违反日内瓦公约，完全不合理的。你方无法把你方片面无理方案说成是合理的、公平的，但却一再重复声称，你方这一方案是‘坚定的、最后的、不能改变的’，你方将不作任何让步，以强迫我方接受你方强行扣留我方被俘人员的方案。我必须指出你方这种幼稚的作法丝毫无助于问题的解决。自从战俘遣返问题开始讨论以来，我方作了多次重大的努力，提出了使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活的合理折衷方案。我方方案完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神。我方方案是对双方公平合理的方案。同时，我必须重复指出这是真正能解决问题的方案。但你方在战俘遣返问题上，不但始终坚持你方片面无理的主张，没有作任何的让步，反而公然背弃了你方发言人愿在遣返我方十三万二千战俘方案轮廓内解决问题的明确诺言，提出强行扣留我方被俘人员的四月二十八日方案，扩大了双方之间本来已经可以缩小的分歧。你方这种背信弃义的行为、片面无理的主张和专横独断的态度，是我方所绝对不能容忍的。在这一双方对等的谈判中，任何问题必须在合理的基础上，通过协商求得解决。为了实现朝鲜的停战，我方在战俘遣返问题上已作了多次重大努力，提出五月二日完全符合日内瓦公约的公平合理方案。战俘遣返问题必须在举世公认的日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决。我方坚定不移的认为我方五月二日折衷方案，是解决问题的唯一合理基础。谈判的下一步完全在于你方，除非你方根本不要朝鲜停战，或者你方的根本目的就是在于继续朝鲜战争，从而有意拒绝解决战俘遣返问题。”
