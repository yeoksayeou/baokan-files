Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: Beijing's "Five-Anti" campaign has basically concluded, and the work of classifying and handling private industrial and commercial enterprises is largely complete. Currently, under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government and with the active unity of the workers, private industrial and commercial enterprises are actively resuming and developing production and business.

In order to encourage the business enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial enterprises and overcome their passive waiting and purely relying on government assistance, the Municipal People's Government has vigorously publicized policies to private industrial and commercial enterprises. Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, also summoned approximately 5,000 representatives of private industrial and commercial enterprises to give a report. He clearly pointed out that for private industrial and commercial enterprises currently experiencing temporary difficulties in production and business, the main reliance is on their active management to solve the problems. The government will provide assistance through loans, purchasing finished products, and processing orders. According to incomplete statistics, from April 27th to May 15th, 9,746 factories and shops have received over 120 billion yuan in processing orders, purchases of finished products, and loans. At the same time, in order to take care of the temporary difficulties of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, for private industrial and commercial enterprises beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, after they have formulated specific plans for paying refunds, supplementary payments, and fines, all are allowed to postpone payment until after September. These measures have played a great role in inspiring the enthusiasm of private industrial and commercial enterprises and in restoring and developing the production and business of private industry and commerce.

Currently, private industrial and commercial enterprises are actively restoring and developing production and business. For example, the privately owned Yixinggong Iron Factory, which had previously suspended operations, not only fully resumed production after labor and management equally negotiated and signed a collective contract, but also increased the output of furnace pieces by 50% compared to before. The capital is now building factory buildings and adding lathes and other equipment to expand production. The manager of the privately owned Hefengcheng Weaving Factory originally had little confidence in business. Later, seeing that the workers automatically strengthened labor discipline and improved labor organization, increasing the monthly output by 52% and reducing the substandard cloth rate by 40%, he changed his past negative emotions. Now the capital is expressing to the workers that they are willing to take back all the funds and yarn that were previously withdrawn from the factory and put them into production. Since the manager of the privately owned Yongxing Foreign Paper Store accepted the workers' suggestion to print more practice notebooks and study notebooks and sell them to the countryside, business has been improving day by day. Now the capital is adding paper cutters, hole punchers, electric foil stamping machines, and sixteen-page printing machines to expand business. After the workers of the privately owned Guangming Rubber Factory improved product quality and reduced costs, the capital's confidence in management has increased. Now, in addition to adding three machines, including a rubber press, air pump, and electric roller, they have also borrowed 40 million yuan from the People's Bank to purchase sufficient raw materials. After the capital of the privately owned Caifen Tea House accepted the workers' suggestions to reduce profits, increase turnover, and speed up capital turnover, business has improved significantly, with monthly turnover increasing by 20% to 30% compared to before. The privately owned Qingyunge Incense Shop used to sell superstitious items such as incense, candles, paper money, and tin foil. Now, after the workers suggested switching to selling general merchandise and stationery, the daily turnover has doubled compared to the past.

Now the problem for private industrial and commercial enterprises is that the capital must further increase management enthusiasm, work hard to improve management, open up sales channels in many ways, and negotiate equally with workers to do a good job in production, business, and labor-management relations, in order to completely solve the temporary difficulties encountered, and, on the basis of eliminating the five evils, rapidly develop production and business.

    北京市“五反”运动基本结束
    私营工商户积极恢复发展生产和营业
    【新华社三十一日讯】北京市“五反”运动基本结束，对私营工商户分类处理的工作大体完毕。目前私营工商户正在市人民政府的领导和职工主动的团结下，积极恢复、发展生产和业务。
    为了鼓励私营工商户的经营积极性，克服其消极等待和单纯依靠政府扶助的思想，市人民政府曾大力向私营工商户宣传政策。市财经委员会副主任程宏毅并为此召集私营工商户代表约五千人作了报告。他明确地指出：对于目前生产和营业暂时遭受困难的私营工商户，主要是依靠他们积极经营解决，政府将采取贷款、收购成品和加工定货加以扶助。据不完全的统计，从四月二十七日到五月十五日，已有九千七百四十六户工厂和商店得到一千二百多亿元的加工定货、收购成品及贷款。同时市节约检查委员会为了照顾私营工商户暂时的困难起见，对于有利于国计民生的私营工商户，在其自行订立缴纳退、补、罚款的具体计划后，均准许延至九月以后开始缴款。这些措施，对于鼓舞私营工商户的积极性和恢复与发展私营工商业的生产营业方面，起了极大的作用。
    目前私营工商户都在积极恢复、发展生产和业务。如原来已停工的私营义兴公铁工厂，经劳资双方平等协商签订集体合同后，不但生产已全部恢复，而且炉片的产量较前提高了百分之五十。现资方正修建厂房、增加车床等设备，以扩大生产。私营和丰成织布厂经理原来经营信心不高，后来见到职工自动加强劳动纪律，改进劳动组织，把每月产量提高百分之五十二，次布率降低百分之四十，他就转变了过去消极情绪。现在资方向职工表示，愿将过去从厂子里抽走的资金和纱布全部拿回，投入生产。私营永兴洋纸行经理，自接受职工的建议多印练习簿和学习本向农村推销以来，营业已日见好转，现在资方正添置搬把裁纸刀、打孔机、电烫金机、十六页印字机等以扩大营业。私营光明橡胶厂，经职工把产品质量提高和成本减低后，资方经营信心提高，现在除添置了压胶机、风泵及电滚子三部机器外，又向人民银行贷款四千万元买足了原料。私营采芬茶庄资方，接受职工减低利润、增加流水、加速资金周转的建议后，营业有显著好转，每月流水较前增加了百分之二十到三十。私营庆云阁香店，过去卖香烛、烧纸、冥票、锡箔等迷信品，现经职工建议改做百货和文具生意，每天流水较过去的增加一倍。
    现在私营工商户的问题是：资方必须进一步提高经营积极性，努力改善经营，多方面打开销路，并与工人平等协商，搞好生产营业和劳资关系，以完全解决暂时遭遇到的困难，并在消除五毒的基础上，迅速发展生产和营业。
