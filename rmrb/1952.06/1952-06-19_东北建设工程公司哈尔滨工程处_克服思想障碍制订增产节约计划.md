    Northeast Construction Engineering Company, Harbin Engineering Office
    Overcoming Ideological Obstacles to Formulate Production Increase and Thrift Plans
    Can production increases and thrift be carried out in basic construction departments? The production increase and thrift plan formulated by the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Construction Engineering Company most eloquently answers this question. The production increase and thrift plan formulated by all employees of the office after repeated discussions guarantees that, under the principle of being fast, good, and economical, it will increase production and conserve wealth equivalent to 65,000 tons of grain for the country.
    Before formulating the plan, the leadership of the office conducted a pilot project in an advanced group to get a clear picture of the situation. After gaining experience, they convened a mobilization meeting of 1,600 people, in addition to proposing the overall production increase and thrift goals for the office, they also emphasized the conditions for achieving production increases and thrift in the office, and where to start. The advanced group put forward its own plan to challenge everyone, and their plan opened the door for all the workers in the office to realize the production increase and thrift plan. After the meeting, the workers were mobilized, some workers held meetings overnight to discuss the plan of their group, and their enthusiasm was very high.
    In order to make the production increase and thrift plan a success, it is first necessary to break the erroneous idea of cadres who believe that production increases and thrift cannot be carried out in basic construction departments. This is the first time that the basic construction department has engaged in production increases and thrift, so there are many inconsistencies in the ideological understanding of many cadres. Some people believe that the basic construction department is a chaotic mess, and the work has not yet entered the right track, so there are no conditions for realizing the production increase and thrift plan. Some cadres believe that waste in basic construction projects is unavoidable. Others believe that construction workers are mobile, scattered, and backward, and it is impossible to mobilize the masses. In response to these erroneous views, an ideological struggle was launched. The leadership clearly pointed out that construction workers have often engaged in decentralized production, and their awareness used to be low. In the past three years, the Party has conducted in-depth education for them (especially the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles), and their awareness has generally improved. Advanced production groups such as Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, Yang Dezhong, and Yu Donghai have emerged among the construction workers, which is the best proof. If we turn a blind eye to this new situation and new conditions among construction workers and continue to treat them with old and incorrect views, then we will not be able to mobilize the workers at all and will only lag behind the workers. The many vivid facts that have already appeared in the office have also educated some cadres. The materials management personnel were originally unwilling to sign contracts with the construction personnel. They said: The company must first sign a contract with us before we can sign a contract with you. After discussion, their confidence increased. They guaranteed timely procurement and timely supply, so as to avoid the phenomenon of work stoppages waiting for materials; they guaranteed that the materials meet the specifications, and that the material transportation loss rate and storage loss rate will be reduced by 40 percent, which is estimated to save more than 2 billion yuan.
    After the leadership solved the ideological problems of the cadres, they continued to solve the ideological obstacles existing among the workers. Some workers believe that "there can be no plans until the drawings arrive and the budget comes out." Some people think: "The Northeast Industrial Department has revised the quotas, there is no more profit to be made, where can we save?" Outside workers generally do not care about the production increase and thrift movement, their idea is "earn money and go home, don't bother with these production increases." Others are worried that increasing efficiency will lead to higher quotas.
    In response to these ideological problems, the leadership fully utilized the organizational strength, designated reporters, propagandists, and activists in the "Three-Anti" movement to conduct in-depth propaganda and education work; and re-conveyed Comrade Gao Gang's report on production increases and thrift and Comrade Gao Gang's speech at the workers' training class, organizing everyone to study. When discussing documents related to production increases and thrift, combined with the specific facts of the gradual improvement of workers' lives, it was proposed that: "Implementing production increases and thrift, accelerating national industrialization, is directly for the benefit of the working class." At the same time, conservative ideas were repeatedly criticized, pointing out that there is great potential in basic construction. In this extensive and in-depth mobilization work, most employees initially solved ideological problems. However, some people still lacked confidence in production increases and thrift, feeling that there was no way and did not know where to start. The leadership adopted a typical demonstration method to help advanced groups such as Su Changyou, Xie Wanfu, and Yang Dezhong to formulate production increase and thrift plans (Su Changyou group increased production and saved 380 tons of grain, Xie Wanfu group increased production and saved 410 tons of grain, Yang Dezhong group increased production and saved 434 tons of grain), providing a clear target for everyone and increasing everyone's confidence. All the workers in the office immediately took action. More than 300 bricklayers learned Su Changyou's method of squeezing slurry with both hands, increasing production efficiency by 150 percent. The original plan was to need an average of more than 1,000 bricklayers throughout the year, but now 500 bricklayers are enough. The new plan saves about 600 technical workers, solving the problem of insufficient technicians after construction starts.
    After the movement started, the vast number of workers had already taken vigorous action, and the staff had also been mobilized, but the technical personnel had not yet taken action. Their ideological obstacles were "there are no conditions for engaging in production increases and thrift" and "the production increase and thrift movement is the workers' business and has little to do with them." Therefore, they had no confidence and did not know where to start. The leadership first talked with the technical personnel separately to understand their ideological situation, and then held a symposium for technical personnel. In addition to strictly criticizing some incorrect ideas, they also conducted repeated and patient mobilization, explaining the significance of the production increase and thrift movement and the importance of the participation of technical personnel in the production increase and thrift movement; and especially emphasized the question of from which aspects to start formulating production increase and thrift plans. After the technical personnel recognized the great significance of the production increase and thrift movement and the role they should play in the movement, they immediately became active and engaged in heated discussions, unanimously believing that there were many places where production could be increased and thrift could be practiced. Every construction site director expressed his determination to rely on the workers to formulate production increase and thrift plans. The leadership encouraged them on the spot, assigned certain cadres to the construction site to assist, and emphasized that the democratic management committee should be used to study and formulate production increase and thrift plans. The ideological obstacles of the technical personnel were finally broken through, and all the employees in the office actively joined the upsurge of production increases and thrift.

    东北建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处
    克服思想障碍制订增产节约计划
    在基本建设部门能不能进行增产节约？东北建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处制订的增产节约计划，最雄辩地解答了这个问题。该处全体职工经过反复讨论订出的增产节约计划，保证在又快、又好、又省钱的原则下，为国家增产节约了价值六万五千吨粮食的财富。
    在订计划以前，该处领导方面为了做到心中有数，曾在一个先进小组里进行试点；在取得经验之后，召开了一千六百人的动员大会，除提出全处的增产节约的目标外，并着重地说明了在本处实现增产节约的条件，以及从何着手的问题。先进小组提出自己的计划，向大家挑战，他们的计划给全处工人打开了在该处实现增产节约计划的大门。会后，工人都动起来了，有的工人连夜开会，讨论本组计划，情绪非常高涨。
    为了把增产节约计划做好，首先要打破干部认为基本建设部门不能进行增产节约的错误思想。基本建设部门搞增产节约尚是第一次，因此，在许多干部思想认识上很不一致。有些人认为基本建设部门是个乱摊子，工作还没有步入正轨，因此没有条件实现增产节约计划。有的干部认为基本建设工程的浪费是不可避免的。还有些人认为建筑工人是流动的，分散的，落后的，不可能发动群众运动。针对这些错误观点，展开了思想斗争。领导方面明确指出：建筑工人由于经常进行分散生产，他们的觉悟曾经是较低的。三年以来，党对他们进行了深入的教育（特别是“三反”、“五反”斗争的教育），他们的觉悟已普遍提高。建筑工人中涌现了苏长有、谢万福、杨德重、于东海等先进生产小组，这就是最好的例证。如果对建筑工人中这种新情况、新条件熟视无睹，仍然用旧的不正确的看法对待他们，那就根本不能把工人发动起来，只会落在工人后面。该处已经出现的许多生动的事实，也教育了某些干部。管材料的人员本来不愿意和施工人员订合同，他们说：公司先和我们订了合同，我们才能和你们订。经过讨论，他们的信心提高了。他们保证及时采购及时供应，不使发生停工待料的现象；保证材料符合规格，并使材料运输损耗率和保管损耗率降低百分之四十，计可节省人民币二十亿元以上。
    领导方面解决了干部的思想问题，便继续解决工人群众中所存在的思想障碍。有些工人认为“图纸未到，预算没出来，计划不了。”有些人认为：“东北工业部定额修正了，没有油水了，从那里节约？”外工普遍地不关心增产节约运动，他们的想法是“挣钱回家，不扯这些增不增产。”还有些人耽心提高了效率要提高定额。
    针对这些思想问题，领导方面又充分地发挥了组织力量，指定报告员、宣传员、“三反”运动中的积极分子，深入地进行宣传教育工作；并重新传达了高岗同志关于增产节约的报告和高岗同志在工人训练班的讲话，组织大家进行学习。在讨论有关增产节约的文件时，结合工人生活逐步提高的具体事实，提出：“实行增产节约，加速国家工业化，这是直接为工人阶级谋福利。”同时反复地批判了保守思想，指出基本建设中有很大的潜在力量。在这广泛深入的动员工作中，大部分职工初步地解决了思想问题。但是有些人对增产节约还缺乏信心，感觉没有办法，不知从何着手。领导方面采取了典型示范的方式，帮助苏长有、谢万福、杨德重等先进小组，订增产节约计划（苏长有小组增产节约三百八十吨粮食、谢万福小组增产节约四百一十吨粮食、杨德重小组增产节约四百三十四吨粮食），为大家指出了明确的目标，提高了大家的信心。全处工人立刻行动起来。三百多名瓦工学会了苏长有的双手挤浆法，生产效率提高了百分之一百五十，原计划全年平均需瓦工一千多名，现有五百名瓦工就够了。新计划节省了约六百名技术工人，解决了开工后技工不足的问题。
    运动开始以后，广大工人已经轰轰烈烈地行动起来了，职员也动起来了，但技术人员还没有动。他们的思想障碍是“搞增产节约没条件”、“增产节约运动是工人的事情，和自己的关系不大”。因此，他们没有信心，也不知从那里作起。领导方面先分别找技术人员谈话，了解了他们的思想情况，然后召开技术人员座谈会，除了严格地批判了一些不正确的思想外，又进行了反复的耐心的动员，说明增产节约运动的意义，及技术人员参加增产节约运动的重要性；特别着重地讨论了从那几方面着手订立增产节约计划的问题。技术人员认清了增产节约运动的伟大意义和他们在运动中应起的作用以后，他们立刻积极起来，展开热烈的讨论，一致认为可以增产节约的地方很多。每一个工地主任都表示了依靠工人订立增产节约计划的决心。领导方面当场鼓励了他们，分配一定的干部到工地予以协助，并强调要通过民主管理委员会来研究和制订增产节约计划。技术人员的思想障碍最后被突破了，全处职工都积极卷入增产节约的热潮。
