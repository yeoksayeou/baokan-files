The Jinghui Farm, under the leadership of the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, held a wheat bumper harvest appraisal and observation meeting on May 22nd. After the on-site appraisal and observation in the fields, the visiting farmers deeply experienced the superiority of the state-run farm's agricultural management and understood the principle that to achieve bumper harvests, it is necessary to organize and apply scientific farming techniques.

In March of this year, Jinghui Farm, together with ten other state-run farms and one People's Liberation Army farm, jointly issued a challenge to farmers across the country. After launching the patriotic production increase campaign, as a result of the efforts of all agricultural workers, the wheat growth situation at Jinghui Farm was extremely good. To promote local wheat bumper harvest appraisal and seed selection work, and to exchange bumper harvest experiences, Jinghui Farm invited more than 130 people from Jingyang, Sanyuan, Fuping, Yaoxian, Gaoling and other five counties, including mutual aid team leaders, agricultural labor models, production experts, and bumper harvest household farmer representatives, to participate in the appraisal and observation. Representatives from the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Xianyang Special District Farm, and the Sanyuan County People's Government also attended.

During the meeting, a appraisal committee was formed, consisting of seventeen people including farmer representatives from five counties, representatives from governments at all levels, and agricultural technicians. All representatives participated in the observation and appraisal. The methods of observation and appraisal were as follows: All representatives were divided into two groups. One group went to the wheat fields to observe and select the best local bumper harvest wheat, first-crop irrigated wheat, dryland wheat, and second-crop wheat plots, and estimate the yield of each. The other group examined the farming conditions of these types of wheat based on the challenge conditions issued by the farm in March, and measured the yield. When measuring the yield, a plot of 30 square chi of wheat land was measured with a tape measure and surrounded with rope. First, the number of ears of wheat was counted, then appropriate ears of wheat were selected, and the number of grains on them was counted. Then, based on the weight of the grains, combined with the visual estimation of the farmer representatives (there was not much difference between this visual estimation and the actual measurement), the final result was obtained.

After group and general discussions, all representatives unanimously agreed that Jinghui Farm's plan to create a wheat bumper harvest record on a large area this year was completely achievable and would be exceeded (more than 20 percent higher than the local average wheat yield). The appraised yield of the twelve mu of bumper harvest wheat at Jinghui Farm was 539.8 jin per mu (the original plan was 500 jin), while the highest yield of local bumper harvest land was 437.23 jin per mu, 23.4 percent higher; The average yield of 73.2 mu of first-crop irrigated wheat at Jinghui Farm was 491.8 jin per mu (the original plan was 300 jin), while the highest yield of local first-crop irrigated wheat was 255 jin, 92.8 percent higher; The average yield of 65 mu of second-crop wheat at Jinghui Farm was 477.59 jin per mu (the original plan was 300 jin), while the highest yield of local second-crop wheat was 307.44 jin per mu, 55.43 percent higher; The average yield of 17.83 mu of dryland wheat at Jinghui Farm was 458 jin per mu (the original plan was 300 jin), while the highest yield of local dryland wheat was 249.7 jin per mu, 83.4 percent higher.

The farmers participating in the observation meeting generally improved their ideological understanding after field observation, group deliberation, and general discussion. They also gained many benefits in agricultural technology. After the discussion and appraisal, all the representatives studied the reasons why Jinghui Farm was able to achieve a bumper harvest. Everyone recognized the superiority of state-run farms and further realized that only by organizing and engaging in collective production can they embark on the road from poverty to prosperity. Jinghui Farm is now using some new farm tools (such as new walking plows, horse-drawn harvesters, seeders, etc.). All agricultural workers have unified leadership and a unified production plan, which can improve work efficiency. Therefore, the farm's production costs are constantly decreasing, and the yield per unit area is constantly increasing. Generally, individual farmers can manage a maximum of 15 to 20 mu of irrigated land per year; Jinghui Farm can manage an average of 30 to 40 mu of irrigated land per person. Generally, individual farmers need one head of livestock for more than 20 mu of land, and two heads of livestock for more than 50 mu of land; while Jinghui Farm has more than 1,350 mu of land, but only uses 35 heads of livestock, an average of 40 mu of land can be cultivated per head of livestock, and the land can be cultivated deeply and many times. The workers on the farm can not only maintain regular political and cultural learning, but also regularly discuss and study advanced farming techniques. Therefore, their political awareness and cultural and technical level are gradually improving; Through various competitions, their production enthusiasm is fully utilized, contributing all their strength and wisdom to improving yields.

Everyone believes that to achieve a bumper harvest, it is also necessary to continuously learn the scientific farming techniques of state-run farms. The advantages of Jinghui Farm in farming technology are: 1. Timely deep plowing and fine harrowing. Last year, Jinghui Farm's wheat fields were plowed twice with a five-inch walking plow and twice with a seven-inch walking plow. Each time was after rain. They harrowed four to six times in total. This preserved the moisture in the soil and removed weeds from the ground. 2. Reasonable phased application of large amounts of fertilizer. Jinghui Farm applies large amounts of manure, oil cake, and chemical fertilizers in stages, depending on the fertility of the soil and the type of stubble, and in combination with rain and irrigation. An average of about 6,000 jin of manure is applied per mu, which is incorporated into the soil before the third plowing. 100 to 150 jin of oil cake are applied per mu of first-crop land, and 150 to 180 jin are applied per mu of second-crop land; Before Qingming Festival, 18 to 20 jin of top dressing (chemical fertilizer) are also applied per mu. 3. Closely coordinate planting time with climate. For example, after last year's autumn harvest, the local masses generally rushed to plant around September 25th in order to seize the soil moisture. At that time, the weather was warm, and Jinghui Farm estimated that if planting was done then, the wheat would easily grow too vigorously. Therefore, it planted five to ten days later than the local masses, on October 1st to 5th. Because Jinghui Farm had done a good job of preserving soil moisture in advance, and had rolled all the land once during planting, there was still moisture even though it was planted late. 4. Adopt different farming methods for different varieties. The varieties used by Jinghui Farm are "Bima No. 1" and "Jinghui Farm No. 26" (drought-resistant wheat bred by Jinghui Farm itself). "Bima No. 1" is suitable for planting in irrigated land; "Jinghui Farm No. 26" is drought-resistant. Jinghui Farm uses different amounts of fertilizer and different farming methods according to these different qualities. In addition, the local masses do not believe that winter irrigation and spring irrigation can increase yields; The wheat fields irrigated by the farm with winter irrigation and spring irrigation are obviously better than those without irrigation.

After discussing and learning these experiences, everyone deeply realized their importance. Farmer Wei Dajiang's second-crop wheat was originally better than that of the average farmer in the local area. During this appraisal, everyone compared his second-crop wheat with the farm's second-crop wheat. First, they measured the height: his second-crop wheat was one meter high, and the farm's second-crop wheat was 1.3 meters high. After dividing the area, counting the ears, counting the grains, and weighing them, it was calculated that Wei Dajiang's wheat yield per mu was 307.44 jin, while Jinghui Farm's yield per mu reached 477.59 jin, which was 55.43 percent higher than Wei Dajiang's. Wei Dajiang said: "The farm's method of growing crops is good. I must follow the farm's method to grow land in the future. There is nothing wrong with following the farm!"

The farmers participating in this observation and appraisal criticized some of the shortcomings in Jinghui Farm's work with a sense of ownership. The comrades of Jinghui Farm sincerely accepted these criticisms and expressed that they would definitely follow these opinions to check and improve their work, and work with the farmers to continue to improve the yield per unit area of various crops.

    国营泾惠农场举行小麦丰产评比观摩会
    西北农林部领导的泾惠农场，在五月二十二日举行了小麦丰产评比观摩会。参观的农民群众经过了田间实际的评比、观摩后，都深刻地体验到国营农场农业经营的优越性；认识了要获得丰产，一定要组织起来，并且运用科学的耕作技术的道理。
    今年三月间泾惠农场和其他十个国营农场、一个解放军农场联合向全国农民发出挑战书。开展爱国增产竞赛以后，全场农业工人努力耕作的结果，泾惠农场的小麦生长情况极为良好。为了推动当地的小麦丰产评比和选种工作，交流丰产经验，泾惠农场邀请泾阳、三原、富平、耀县、高陵等五县的互助组长、农业劳动模范、生产能手、丰产户农民代表共一百三十多人到场评比、观摩。中央农业部、西北农林部、陕西省农林厅、咸阳专区农场、三原县人民政府等机关也派了代表参加。
    会中，由五个县的农民代表、各级人民政府代表和农业技术人员共十七人组成评比委员会。全体代表都参加了观摩评比。观摩、评比的方法是：把全体代表分成两组，一面到小麦地中观察，选出当地最好的丰产小麦、正槎水地小麦、旱地小麦、回槎地小麦各一块，分别估好产量；一面以这个农场在三月份发出的挑战条件，检查这几种小麦的耕作情况，测定产量。测定产量时，用皮尺量好三十平方市尺的麦地一块，用绳围起来；先数麦穗，再选择适当的麦穗，数上面的麦粒。然后根据麦粒的重量，并结合农民代表们目测估计（这次目测估计与实测没有多少出入），得出最后的结果。
    经过小组和大会讨论，全体代表一致认为：泾惠农场今年在大面积上创造小麦丰产纪录的计划是完全可以超额完成的（比当地小麦的平均产量高出百分之二十）。泾惠农场十二亩丰产地小麦评定产量为每亩五百三十九点八市斤（原计划产五百市斤），而当地丰产地最高产量为每亩四百三十七点二三市斤，计高出百分之二十三点四；泾惠农场正槎水地小麦共七十三亩二分，每亩平均为四百九十一点八市斤（原计划产三百市斤），而当地正槎水地小麦最高产量为二百五十五市斤，计高出百分之九十二点八；泾惠农场回槎地小麦共六十五亩，每亩平均为四百七十七点五九市斤（原计划产三百市斤），而当地回槎小麦每亩最高产量为三百零七点四四市斤，计高出百分之五十五点四三；泾惠农场旱地小麦共十七亩八分三，每亩平均产量为四百五十八市斤（原计划产三百市斤），而当地旱地小麦每亩最高产量为二百四十九点七市斤，计高出百分之八十三点四。
    参加观摩会的农民群众，经过了田间观摩、小组酝酿、大会讨论后，思想认识普遍提高了一步，他们在农业技术上也得到不少益处。在讨论、评比结束后，全体代表研究了泾惠农场能够获得丰产的原因。大家认识了国营农场的优越性，也更加认识了只有组织起来，集体生产，才能走上由穷变富的道路。泾惠农场现在已经使用一部分新式农具（如新式步犁、马拉收割机、播种机等），全体农业工人有着统一的领导和统一的生产计划，能够提高工作效率。因此，这个农场的生产成本不断降低，单位面积产量不断提高。一般单干农民，一个全劳动力一年最多能经营十五亩到二十亩水地；泾惠农场平均每人可以经营三十亩到四十亩水地。一般单干农民经营二十多亩地，就得一条牲口，五十多亩地就得两条牲口；而泾惠农场共有一千三百五十多亩地，只用了三十五条牲口，平均每条牲口可以耕地四十亩，而且可以耕得深、次数多。农场中的工人们，不但能够保持经常的政治、文化学习，而且也可以经常地讨论和研究先进的耕作技术。因此，他们的政治觉悟和文化、技术水平就日渐提高；通过各种竞赛，他们的生产积极性充分地发挥出来，为提高产量贡献出全部力量和智慧。
    大家认为：要获得丰产，还要不断学习国营农场的科学的耕作技术。泾惠农场在耕作技术上的优点是：一、适时深耕细耱。去年泾惠农场的小麦地曾用五吋步犁耕了两次，七吋步犁耕了两次。每次都在下雨之后。一共耙、耱了四次到六次。这样就保存了土壤中的水分，除去了地里的杂草。二、合理分期大量施肥。泾惠农场根据土壤的肥瘠和槎口的不同，配合雨水和灌溉，分期施用大量的圈粪、油渣和化学肥料。每亩平均约施圈肥六千斤，在耕第三次以前施入土中。正槎地每亩施用油渣一百到一百五十斤，回槎地每亩施用一百五十斤到一百八十斤；在清明节前，每亩并施追肥（化学肥料）十八斤到二十斤。三、播种时间和气候密切配合。如去年秋收后，当地一般群众为了抢墒，即在阳历九月二十五日左右播种。当时天气温暖，泾惠农场估计那时下种，小麦容易发旺，因而比当地一般群众迟播了五天至十天，在十月一日到五日才播种。泾惠农场因为事先做好了保墒工作，又在播种时把所有的地都辗了一遍，因此，虽然迟播，仍然有墒。四、不同品种采用不同的耕作方法。泾惠农场采用的品种是“碧蚂一号”及“泾惠农场二十六号”（泾惠农场自己育成的耐旱小麦）。“碧蚂一号”宜种于水地；“泾惠农场二十六号”能耐旱。泾惠农场根据这种不同的品质，施用不同量的肥料，采用不同的耕作方法。另外，当地群众对冬灌、春灌能增加产量都不大相信；农场试验冬灌和春灌的麦田，显然比没灌水的好。
    大家讨论、学习了这些经验以后，深深地体会到它们的重要性。农民韦大江的回槎麦子，本来在当地是比一般农民都好的。这次评比时，大家就拿他的回槎麦子和农场的回槎麦子相比。先量了一下高低：他的回槎麦是一公尺高，农场的回槎麦是一点三公尺高。再经过划面、数穗、数粒、秤重后，算出韦大江每亩麦子产量是三百零七点四四市斤，泾惠农场每亩产量却达四百七十七点五九市斤，比韦大江的要高出百分之五十五点四三。韦大江说：“农场种庄稼的办法好，我以后一定要照农场的办法来种地。跟上农场没有错！”
    参加这次观摩、评比农民，以主人翁的态度，批评了泾惠农场工作中的一些缺点。泾惠农场的同志诚恳地接受了这些批评意见，并表示一定按照这些意见来检查和改进工作，和农民群众一起，为继续提高各种农作物的单位面积产量而奋斗。
