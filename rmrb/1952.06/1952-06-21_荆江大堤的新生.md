    The Rebirth of the Jingjiang Dike
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hai Bo
    On June 14, 1952, the Jingjiang Dike Reinforcement Project was declared a victorious completion. From Zaolingang in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, to Mabugui in Jianli County, a magnificent and beautiful new Jingjiang Dike was erected along the 133-kilometer-long riverbank. This new dike, 10 meters wide at the top, over 30 meters wide at the bottom, and 12 to 16 meters high, stretches along the river like a strong giant. It closely monitors the surging floodwaters of the Jingjiang River, safeguarding the safety of millions of people in the Jianghan Plain.

    The completion of this new dike brings infinite joy to millions of people in the Jianghan Plain. When the Jingjiang Dike Reinforcement Project was just completed, people from dozens of miles around the dike rushed to visit. Standing on the Jingjiang Dike, looking out at the endless expanse of green rice and cotton fields within the dike, many farmers said with immense gratitude: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have repaired the 'Lifeline Dike'! Now we can work peacefully during the day and sleep soundly at night." They cheered for the victorious completion of the Jingjiang Dike Reinforcement Project as if it were a festival.

    However, before liberation, this "Lifeline Dike," which protected the lives and property of millions of people in the Jianghan Plain, was in disrepair and riddled with holes. The reactionary rulers, in the name of dike repair, extorted money from the farmers along the dike, but when floods came, no one cared. To cover their eyes, the Kuomintang reactionary government stuffed some branches and grass bags into the dangerous sections. Over time, the branches rotted, and the holes in the dike grew larger. Instead of finding ways to protect the dike, they ridiculously placed nine large iron oxen, each weighing tens of thousands of pounds, on the dike, claiming that these iron oxen could suppress the "River Flood," deceiving the people along the river who suffered from floods for many years. This "Lifeline Dike" deteriorated, eventually becoming a "tofu-dreg dike."

    In the summer of 1949, the extraordinary peak of the Yangtze River flood reached 44.49 meters in the Shashi area. This dike, which had been ruined by the reactionary rulers, was reduced to a mere one-meter-wide embankment in the Shashi and Guanyinsi areas. In this critical situation, the heroic People's Liberation Army, while liberating Shashi, and for the sake of the safety and survival of the people of Jianghan, fought while urgently repairing the dike. Many newly arrived local cadres, without even putting down their backpacks, led the masses in rescuing the dike. They fought day and night against the floodwaters, finally saving the dike and preventing the flood from overflowing.

    After liberation, the People's Government not only promulgated laws to protect and repair the dike but also established the "Jingjiang Dike Repair and Protection Office." For three years, it has led the people along the river in carrying out various urgent dike repair and hazard removal work. During the summer flood season of 1950, more than ten counties in the Jingzhou Special District, under the direct command of the commissioner and county heads, organized an army of 100,000 to protect the dike, ensuring the safe passage of dangerous sections in Shashi, Guanyinsi, and other places during the flood season. The annual repair work this year involved over 3.764 million cubic meters of earthwork and over 50,000 cubic meters of stonework, which was more than nine times the amount of work done by the Kuomintang in four years. To repair the Jingjiang Dike, the People's Government allocated large sums of money every year to this construction project, gradually strengthening the dike's reinforcement. From 1949 to 1951, the annual repair work involved a total of over 6 million cubic meters of earthwork, greatly reducing the potential hazards of the entire dike and rapidly changing the appearance of the broken dike.

    In order to thoroughly repair the Jingjiang Dike and eliminate the threat of annual floods to the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River, in April of this year, the Central People's Government specifically issued a decision on the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, which specifically stipulated that the reinforcement of the Jingjiang Dike should be completed before the flood season this year. The working people on both sides of the Jingjiang River, who were cared for by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, enthusiastically responded to this call and unveiled the curtain on this massive project on April 5. From the very beginning of the project, more than 20,000 workers on the dike launched a warm labor competition. In their work, they created the spillway method, solving the difficulty of moving and throwing large boulders. During tamping, they automatically proposed "layer of soil, layer of tamping," making the dike body strong and firm. Worker Yang Xuangui transported 220 loads of soil per day over a distance of 800 meters. Even monks who used to chant scriptures are now participating in earthwork. An old woman in her sixties from the Sixth Dike Construction Team insisted on participating in the project, and she refused to rest even when she was sick. She said: "Only Chairman Mao cares about us so much. I must create happiness for future generations."

    Precisely for the sake of eternal happiness, the more than 20,000 workers, laborers, and military personnel participating in the Jingjiang Dike Reinforcement Project worked tirelessly, braving heavy rain and intense heat, day and night. After 71 days of intensive construction, the reinforcement project has now been victoriously completed. Today, seeing this great labor achievement, no one calls the Jingjiang Dike a "tofu-dreg dike" anymore, but calls it a "copper wall" and "iron wall." The vast number of employees participating in the reinforcement also understand more clearly: under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, the people have begun to repel the attack of floods for thousands of years with their own labor and wisdom, and in the future, they will make the floods even more docile.

    荆江大堤的新生
    新华社记者　海　波
    一九五二年六月十四日，荆江大堤加固工程宣布胜利完工。从湖北省江陵县枣林岗到监利县麻布拐，一百三十三公里长的江岸上，树起了一座雄伟而美丽的崭新的荆江大堤。这道上宽十公尺、下宽三十多公尺、高达十二公尺到十六公尺的新堤，沿江伸展着，像一个坚强的巨人。它紧紧地监视着汹涌的荆江洪水，捍卫着江汉平原千百万人民的安全。
    这座新堤的落成，带给江汉平原千百万人民无限的喜悦。当荆江大堤加固工程刚完工时，堤下数十里路地区的人民都赶来参观。他们站在荆江大堤上眺望着堤内一望无际的碧绿的稻田和棉田，许多农民都感激不尽地说：“在毛主席领导下，我们把‘命堤’可修好了，以后我们可以白天安心生产、夜里放心睡觉了。”他们像过节一样地为荆江大堤加固工程的胜利完工而欢呼。
    然而，解放前，这道保护着江汉平原千百万人民生命财产的“命堤”，年久失修，千疮百孔。反动统治者除了借修堤之名，向沿堤农民进行敲诈外，洪水来了却没人管。国民党反动政府为了掩人耳目，他们用一些树枝、草包塞进险工处，时间长了树枝腐烂，堤的漏洞日益加大。他们不想办法防护大堤，却可笑地在大堤上做了九个重达万斤的大铁牛，说这铁牛可以镇压“江洪”，用来欺蒙沿江长年受水灾痛苦的人民。这座“命堤”每况愈下，结果成了一座“豆腐渣堤”。
    一九四九年夏天，长江异常洪峰在沙市一带曾高达四四点四九公尺。这道被反动统治者糟蹋得残破不堪的大堤，在沙市、观音寺一带只剩下一公尺宽的堤埂。在这样万急的情况下，英勇的人民解放军在解放沙市同时，为了江汉人民的安危存亡，就一面作战，一面紧张地抢险修堤。许多新到的地方干部未及放下背包，就领导群众一块儿上堤抢救。他们日夜和洪水搏斗，终于保住了堤，挡住了洪水漫溢。
    解放后，人民政府一面颁布了护堤、修堤法令，一面又专设了“荆江大堤修防处”。三年来领导沿江人民，展开了各种紧张的修堤整险的工作。一九五○年夏汛期间，荆州专区十多个县在专员和各县县长直接指挥下，组织了十万抢险大军上堤防护，使沙市、观音寺等地险工安然渡过汛期。这一年的岁修工程共作了土方三百七十六万四千多公方，石方也达五万多方，比国民党四年的工程大九倍以上。为了把荆江大堤修好，人民政府每年都拨出大批款项投入这个建设工程，使大堤的培修工程日益增强。自一九四九年到一九五一年，三年来岁修土方共达六百多万公方，全堤隐患大大减少，破碎的大堤迅速改观。
    为了彻底修好荆江大堤，解除每年汛期洪水对荆江两岸人民的威胁，今年四月间，中央人民政府特发出荆江分洪工程的决定，其中并具体地规定了要在今年汛前完成荆江大堤的加固工程。受到毛主席和中央人民政府关怀的荆江两岸的劳动人民，他们便热情地响应了这个号召，在四月五日揭开了这一巨大工程的序幕。工程一开始，上堤的两万多民工就展开热烈的劳动竞赛。工作中，他们创造了泄网方法，解决了搬抛大块蛮石的困难。打硪中，他们又自动提出“层土层硪”，使堤身修得又坚又牢。民工杨宣贵在八百公尺的运距内，每日挑土达二百二十担。连念经的和尚，现在也来参加作土方。堤工六大队一个六十多岁的老太婆，坚决要求参加了工程，工作中她病了仍不肯休息。她说：“只有毛主席才这样关心我们，我一定要为子孙后代谋幸福。”
    正是为了永远的幸福，参加荆江大堤加固工程的二万多工人、民工、军工不怕艰苦，不怕困难，日夜冒着大雨冒着酷热地工作着。七十一天的突击施工，加固工程现在终于胜利完工了。今天，看到这个伟大的劳动成果，已没有人再称荆江大堤是“豆腐渣堤”了，而把它叫做“铜墙”、“铁壁”了。参加加固的广大员工也更加明白了：在毛主席、共产党和人民政府领导下，人民已用自己的劳动和智慧，开始打退几千年来洪水的进攻，将来更会把洪水制得更驯服。
