The Central Flood Control Headquarters' Instructions on Flood Control Work in 1952

Currently, the flood season has already begun in Central South, East China, and Southwest China. The major flood season is also approaching in North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia. In order to protect agricultural production in vast areas, as well as the safety of some cities, industrial and mining enterprises, and transportation from the threat of floods, flood control work has become a nationwide and important task. All regions that have established flood control organizations should continue to heighten vigilance and strengthen their work. Regions that have not yet established such organizations should, based on past experience and actual needs, quickly establish flood control organizations, mobilize and organize the masses, and strive to overcome this year's floods.

Regarding this year's flood control work, in addition to continuing to implement the "Instructions on Strengthening Flood Control Work" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government in 1951, special attention should be paid to the following points:

1.  Fully mobilize, organize, and prepare to overcome the idea of negligence and complacency.

Due to the vigorous construction of water conservancy projects in various regions over the past two or three years, the number of flood disasters nationwide has decreased year by year. This year, some cadres and the masses may believe that we have a considerable grasp on preventing floods, thus giving rise to complacency or negligence. This kind of thinking is extremely harmful to flood control work and must be resolutely overcome. It is important to know that although the governance of rivers across the country has solved many problems in recent years, there are still many problems that have not been solved or completely solved. Regarding rivers that have begun to be fundamentally governed, the Yi River and Shu River can basically eliminate water disasters, but some areas in Shandong Province may still experience flooding and need to be further governed. The Huai River has begun to break free from the threat of perennial floods, and can guarantee that major areas will not be flooded in the event of severe floods; however, the entire project has not yet been completed, and flood storage and discharge cannot be completely controlled, so the threat of water disasters has not been completely eliminated. The Yongding River reservoir will not be able to exert its flood storage effect until next year's flood season. The Chaobai River has only completed the downstream regulation project, which can defend against a certain amount of flood flow, but cannot completely eliminate water disasters. As for other large rivers: after several years of repair, the dikes of the Yellow River in the lower reaches of the three provinces are generally 1.5 to 2.5 meters higher than the highest water level in 1933. Last year, the Beijindi flood detention project was also built, which can defend against the largest flood in 1933 and prevent major disasters, but complete elimination of water disasters still requires the construction of reservoirs in the middle reaches and some important tributaries. The Yangtze River has built the Jingjiang flood diversion project this year, which can provide strong protection to the section most threatened by floods; however, for the entire river, it cannot defend against the largest flood in 1931. As for the majority of small and medium-sized rivers, although the dike projects have been generally strengthened, they can only defend against floods of a certain year, and cannot defend against the largest possible flood. Moreover, most of the newly built projects have not been tested by severe floods, and the existing projects may have undiscovered shortcomings. As for the disasters of mountain floods and waterlogging, it is even more difficult to completely eliminate them for a while. Therefore, we have no basis for complacency and must heighten vigilance, carefully consider all possible situations, carry out mobilization and organization work as soon as possible, and prepare for a strong fight against floods. Regarding the organization of the masses and the preparation of materials, although there are established rules to follow in various regions, attention should still be paid to inspection to avoid formalism. In areas where there are conflicting interests in flood control and drainage between upstream and downstream, and between the left and right banks, it is even more necessary to carry out persuasive mobilization work among the people in advance to avoid unexpected incidents.

2.  Inspect dikes, dams, and all flood control and drainage projects before and during the flood season, and establish a management and operation system.

Last year, during the dike inspection of the Yellow River, a total of 16,133 holes were drilled using steel cones, the largest of which could hold more than 40 people, connecting the inside and outside of the dike. This year, during the reinforcement project of the Jingjiang Dike on the Yangtze River, it was discovered that some of the dikes in the Shashi area only had a layer of good soil on top, and the rest were broken bricks and tiles. There were even houses and ancient tombs in the dike body that had not been demolished. The newly built Shijiaowei remote dike project, the Touxiwei upstream and downstream fish-touching Bay project, and the Chenyatangwei project on the Pearl River all experienced subsidence of more than 100 meters of the dike after completion due to unstable foundations. How dangerous these hidden dangers would be if they were soaked by floods! Therefore, this year's dike inspection work should form a mass movement, combined with the problems discovered in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and be carried out at any time before and during the flood season. For newly built large projects, responsible administrative cadres and technical cadres should personally inspect them. All rivers with flood storage, flood diversion, and flood detention projects, or rivers with culverts for discharging internal water, should firmly grasp the changes in water conditions and formulate a unified management and operation system for the opening and closing of various control projects, and report them to the headquarters for record. The people within the flood diversion and flood detention areas must also be mobilized in advance and plans for resettlement and relief must be made. The dikes that were dug open by farmers for irrigation in the drought resistance movement should be carefully inspected and blocked. Places that have been dug open should be regarded as key points of defense.

3.  Flood control work should be closely integrated with drought prevention work.

After entering the flood season, China's climate is prone to torrential rain at any time. At the same time, during this period, various crops require more water, and a slight lack of rainfall will lead to drought. Therefore, in terms of water conservancy serving agriculture, flood control and drought resistance are two sides of the same coin. In the past, some areas did not combine these two tasks well enough. When heavy rains were not coming, farmers demanded drought resistance, but the leadership mechanically arranged flood control; as a result, drought resistance work was not done well, and the flood control organization became a formality. Once heavy rains occurred, it caused a dual disaster of drought followed by flooding. On February 8, 1952, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Vigorously Launching Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Movement." This year's flood control work must be closely integrated with the drought prevention and resistance movement, under the unified leadership of the local responsible leaders, to do a good job in reporting and analyzing rainfall and water conditions, and to widely implement flood forecasting in order to grasp the opportunity and strive for the initiative in flood control work. When it is dry and there is no rain, we should make full use of water sources to help farmers reduce drought disasters; when heavy rains come, we should concentrate our efforts to carry out flood control on various rivers and prevent mountain floods and drain waterlogging.

4.  Effectively manage and use flood control funds and materials to avoid waste.

During the flood season, the use of funds and materials is prone to corruption and waste due to the urgency of the task, the dispersion of locations, and the lack of sound expenditure and storage systems. Last year, the East China and Hebei Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions to strengthen financial management during the flood season; both instructions were circulated by the Ministry of Water Resources to various regions for implementation, but the implementation in various regions was still not strict. There were also serious chaotic phenomena in some areas: such as the lack of specific systems for expenditure reimbursement; insufficient preparation in advance, temporary procurement of equipment, resulting in great waste; and the failure to properly store or dispose of surplus equipment after the flood season, allowing it to be lost or moldy. This year, all regions must correct these shortcomings, formulate feasible methods in light of local conditions, and strictly implement them. The surplus equipment from the past should be thoroughly cleaned up and used as much as possible this year. After the end of the flood season, it should be cleaned up and reimbursed immediately. The remaining equipment should be properly stored for use in the coming year, or disposed of appropriately in accordance with financial regulations.

5.  Give full play to the power of the masses, and on the basis of existing projects, complete and strive to exceed the flood control tasks guaranteed by various regions.

In the past two or three years, although the construction of water conservancy projects in various regions has not fully met the needs of the people, the scale of its development has been rapid and enormous. The people have invested great efforts in water conservancy, and it should be required that every project play its due role. Now the flood season has arrived, which is a severe test for all flood control and drainage projects. The flood control tasks guaranteed by various regions this year are more cautious and specific than before because the understanding of the situation is more in-depth than before. This is beneficial for us to estimate the situation, discover problems, and deploy forces. However, on the other hand, we must also fully estimate the great role of the people's strength in flood control work. In 1949 and 1950, although the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang had long destroyed various defense projects that had not been fully repaired, we greatly reduced flood disasters because the people's governments at all levels were good at relying on the masses and giving play to their courage and wisdom. Now, after two years of water conservancy construction and the accumulation of two years of experience, we should also have higher requirements: all regions should not only victoriously complete the guaranteed tasks, but also give full play to their infinite loyalty to the people, mobilize and organize the great strength of the people, and on the basis of existing projects, strive to defeat the greater floods that we have guaranteed to defeat.

The victory of this year's flood control work is an important key to ensuring this year's bumper agricultural harvest and to increasing production and practicing economy to support the resistance against the United States and aid Korea. All relevant regions across the country should regard this work as the central task for a certain period, and under the unified leadership of the local government, mobilize the broad masses and fight to complete this glorious task!

### 中央防汛总指挥部  关于一九五二年防汛工作的指示

    中央防汛总指挥部
    关于一九五二年防汛工作的指示
    现在中南、华东、西南等地，业已进入汛期，华北、西北、东北、内蒙等地大汛亦将到来。为了保护广大地区的农业生产，及一部分城市、工矿和交通的安全不受洪水威胁，防汛工作已经成为全国性的重要任务。凡是已经成立防汛机构的地区，要继续提高警惕，加强工作，尚未成立机构的地区，也要根据过去经验和实际需要，迅速成立防汛机构，动员和组织群众，为战胜今年的洪水而奋斗。
    关于今年的防汛工作，除去继续执行一九五一年中央人民政府政务院“关于加强防汛工作的指示”以外，应特别注意以下各点：
    一、充分进行动员、组织和准备工作，克服麻痹大意的思想。
    由于两三年来各地大力兴修水利工程，全国水灾逐年减轻，今年可能有部分干部和群众，认为我们对防止水灾已经有了相当的把握，因而产生骄傲自满或疏忽大意的思想。这种思想对防汛工作是极为有害的，必须切实加以克服。要知道这几年全国河道的治理，虽然解决了很多问题，可是也还有许多问题没有解决，或没有完全解决。就已经开始根本治理的河流来说，沂河、沭河已经可以基本上解除水患，可是在山东境内还有部分地区可能发生水灾，需要继续加以治理。淮河已经开始摆脱常年水灾的威胁，在严重洪水的情况下，也可保障主要地区不受泛滥；但全部工程尚未完成，洪水蓄泄还未能完全控制，因此还未能完全解除水灾威胁。永定河的水库，明年汛期才能发生蓄洪的效能。潮白河只完成下游整理工程，已可防御一定流量的洪水，还不能完全免除水患。其他巨大的河流：黄河经过这几年的整修，下游三省堤防一般高出一九三三年最高水位一·五至二·五公尺，去年又修了北金堤滞洪工程，已经可以防御一九三三年最大的洪水。不发生重大灾害，但要完全免除水患，还须待中游和一些重要支流的水库修成以后。长江在今年修了荆江分洪工程，可使遭受洪水威胁最大一段，得到有力的保障；但就全河来说，还不能防御一九三一年最大的洪水。至于多数中小河流，堤防工程虽已普遍加强，可是大抵只能防御一定年份的洪水，还不能防御可能发生的最大洪水。并且新修的工程，多数没有经过严重洪水的考验，旧有的工程也可能存在没有检查出来的缺点。至于山洪、内涝的灾害，更是一时尚难完全免除的。因此我们没有任何根据，可以自满自足，而必须提高警惕，周密考虑一切可能发生的情况，及早进行动员、组织工作，准备对洪水进行坚强的战斗。关于群众的组织，料物的准备，各地虽有成规可循，仍应注意检查，以免流于形式。关于上下游、左右岸对防洪排水有利害冲突的地方，更要事前对人民进行说服动员工作，以免临时发生意外。
    二、在汛前和汛期，随时检查堤防、闸坝和一切有关防洪排水的工程，并建立管理运用的制度。
    去年黄河进行堤防检查，经过用钢锥钻探，共钻出洞穴一万六千一百三十三处，其中最大的洞穴可容四十余人，沟通了堤内和堤外。今年长江进行荆江大堤加固工程，发见沙市一带堤防，有的只有上面一层好土，下面都是碎砖乱瓦，甚至堤身有房屋古墓未曾拆除。珠江新修的石角围遥堤工程、头溪围上下摸鱼湾工程和陈鸭塘围工程，都因为地基不固，在修成以后，有一百多公尺的堤防发生沉陷。这些隐患，若遭受洪水浸灌，是多么危险的事情！因此今年检查堤工工作，应当形成群众性的运动，结合“三反”、“五反”中所发见的问题，在汛前和汛期随时进行。对于新修的较大的工程，更要由负责的行政干部和技术干部亲自检查。凡是做有蓄洪、分洪、滞洪工程的河流，或设有排泄内水的涵闸的河流，都应切实掌握水情变化，对各种控制工程的启闭，订出统一的管理运用的制度，详报本部备查。对分洪、滞洪区域以内的人民，并须事前做好动员工作和安置救济的计划。在抗旱运动中农民因浇地掘开的堤防，尤其要切实检查，加以堵复。掘开过的地方应视为防守的重点。
    三、防汛工作要与防旱工作密切结合。
    我国气候在进入汛期以后，随时有发生暴雨的可能，同时在这一时期各种农作物需水较多，一时雨量稍缺，又会发生旱象。所以就水利为农业服务来说，防汛和抗旱是一个工作的两面。过去有些地区这两种工作结合不够，在大雨未来的时候，农民要求抗旱，领导上却机械地布置防汛；结果是抗旱工作既未做好，防汛组织也流于形式，一旦发生暴雨，造成先旱后涝的双重灾害。一九五二年二月八日中央人民政府政务院曾经发布“大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”。今年的防汛工作，必须和防旱、抗旱的运动紧密结合，由地方负责首长统一领导，做好雨量、水情的报告和分析研究工作，并广泛试行洪水预报，以求掌握时机，争取防汛工作的主动。干旱不雨的时候，应尽量利用水源，帮助农民减轻旱灾；到大雨来临，则集中全力进行各河防汛和防山洪、排内涝等等的工作。
    四、切实掌握防汛经费和器材的管理使用，以避免浪费。
    防汛期间经费和器材的使用，因为任务紧迫，地点分散，支用和保管的制度不够健全，很容易发生贪污浪费的行为。去年华东和河北防汛总指挥部都发过加强防汛期间财务管理工作的指示；两个指示都曾由中央水利部通报各地仿照实行，可是各地执行仍不严格。有的地区并且存在着严重的混乱现象：如支用报销，缺少具体的制度；事前准备不足，临时搜购器材，造成极大的浪费；汛后剩余的器材，不妥善保管或及时处理，听其损失霉烂等。今年，各地必须纠正这些缺点，结合当地实际情况，规定切实可行的办法，严格执行。过去剩余的器材，今年各地应切实清理，尽量使用；汛期结束以后即刻清理报销，剩余的器材要妥善保管，留待来年使用，或依照财务上的规定，及时做适当的处理。
    五、充分发挥群众力量，在现有工程的基础上，必须完成并争取超过各地保证的防汛任务。
    两三年来，各地水利工程的建设，虽然还不能完全满足人民的需要，但是其发展的规模是迅速而巨大的。人民在水利事业上已经投下了巨大的力量，就应当要求每个工程都发挥应有的效益。现在洪水季节已经到来，这对于一切防洪排水的工程是一个严重的考验。今年各地所保证的防汛任务，因为对情况的了解比前深入，所以都比前更为慎重和具体。这对于我们估计情况，发见问题，布置力量，都是有益的事情。可是另一方面，我们还须充分估计人民力量在防汛工作中的伟大作用。一九四九年和一九五零年，虽然是在国民党反动统治长期破坏各种防御工程尚未完全修复的情况下，因为各地人民政府善于依靠群众，发挥群众的勇敢和智慧，我们曾大大地减轻了水灾。现在经过两年的水利建设，积累两年的经验，我们也就应当有更高的要求：各地不但要胜利完成保证的任务，同时要充分发挥对人民负责的无限忠诚，动员组织人民的伟大力量，在现有工程的基础上，争取战胜我们所保证战胜的更大的洪水。
    今年防汛工作的胜利，是保障今年农产丰收的一个重要关键，是增产节约支援抗美援朝的一个重要关键。全国有关地区，应该把这一工作看做一定时期的中心任务，在地方政府统一领导之下，动员广大群众，为完成这个光荣的任务而斗争！
