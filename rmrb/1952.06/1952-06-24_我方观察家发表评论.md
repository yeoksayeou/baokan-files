Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 23rd: According to an announcement by the American side, the American side is preparing to transfer 27,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in South Korea under the name of "release."

    Observers here point out that the American side's unilaterally and arbitrarily announcing the transfer of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang under the name of "release" is a concrete realization of the American side's conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel, and also a new obstacle set by the American side on the prisoner-of-war issue in order to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations. Before both sides have reached an agreement on the entire armistice negotiations, especially on the prisoner-of-war issue, the American side is attempting to force our side to accept its barbaric and unreasonable plan to detain 100,000 of our captured personnel by creating a fait accompli, which is absolutely unacceptable and impermissible. This unilateral behavior of the American side completely undermines all customary and international laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of war by the belligerent parties. This also fully demonstrates that the American side has no sincerity in achieving an early armistice in Korea.

    Observers here also pointed out that the American side announced again on the 20th that our captured personnel had "decreased" by 554 in the past month. Even the United Press could not help but admit that the American side "did not provide any explanation for this decrease." However, no matter what words the American side uses, such as "release" or "decrease," it cannot conceal the criminal fact that the American side is forcibly detaining our captured personnel and carrying out massacres against those who firmly demand repatriation, nor can it conceal the American side's conspiracy to deliberately delay and even sabotage the armistice negotiations.

    我方观察家发表评论
    【新华社开城二十三日电】据美方宣布，美方准备在朝鲜南部以“释放”为名将二万七千名我方被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮。
    此间观察家指出，美方片面地武断地宣布以“释放”为名把我方被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮一事，是美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋的具体实现，也是美方为了拖延和破坏停战谈判而在战俘问题上设置的一个新的障碍。美方在双方对整个停战谈判，特别是对战俘问题尚未达成协议之前，竟企图用造成既成事实来强迫我方接受其蛮横无理的扣留我方十万被俘人员的方案，是绝对不能承认和允许的。美方这种片面的行为，彻底地破坏了交战双方对待战俘的一切习惯法和国际法。这同时也充分说明美方对于早日获致朝鲜停战毫无诚意。
    此间观察家同时指出，美方在二十日又曾宣布，在过去一个月中，我方被俘人员“减少”了五百五十四名。连合众社也不能不承认，美方“对这种减少没有加以任何说明”。但是，无论美方用“释放”或“减少”这些字眼，都丝毫掩盖不了美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员，并对那些坚决要求遣返的人实行屠杀的罪恶事实，也掩盖不了美方蓄意拖延以至破坏停战谈判的阴谋。
