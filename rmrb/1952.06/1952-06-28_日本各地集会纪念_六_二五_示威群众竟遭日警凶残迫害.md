Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: On June 25th, the Japanese people and Korean residents in Japan bravely held rallies and demonstrations across Japan to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War.

The commemorative assembly in Tokyo was held at Shinjuku Station and lasted four hours. The assembly passed a resolution demanding an immediate end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and a ban on the use of bacteriological weapons.

The assembly also demanded the annulment of the separate "peace" treaty and the so-called "security treaty" concluded by the Yoshida government with the American imperialists. Attendees supported the convening of an Asian and Pacific regional peace conference, and pointed out the necessity of strengthening the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world, to realize the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, and to immediately release Duclos.

Following the assembly, a demonstration was held. Police attacked the demonstrators with tear gas. Many demonstrators were injured and thirty were arrested.

Demonstrations were held in several districts of Osaka. In Toyonaka, about 1,000 people held a rally. The purpose of this rally was to fight for independence, against war, and against the establishment of an American military base near Itami in Toyonaka. Demonstrations were also held in Suita. In both places, clashes occurred between demonstrators and police. Eleven demonstrators were injured and sixty were arrested. In Hirakata, Osaka, a crowd demonstrated near the Komatsu Manufacturing Co., which was undertaking American military orders. Fourteen people were arrested as a result.

According to police authorities, a total of 120 mass rallies were held in various places on the 25th, 22 of which resulted in bloodshed due to police suppression, with approximately 100 people injured and 108 arrested.
