Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng of the Central Ministry of Agriculture
Issues Written Talk on the Patriotic Agricultural Increase Production Competition Movement

    The national agricultural season has entered a tense stage, and resolutely implementing the patriotic production increase competition has become a crucial key to determining victory. In order to draw the attention of leading organs at all levels to this movement, Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, issued a written talk on the development and problems of the current patriotic production increase competition movement.

    In his talk, Minister Li Shucheng first pointed out that this year's patriotic production increase competition movement has been vigorously launched throughout the country. The characteristics of this movement are clear goals, distinct banners, and an unprecedentedly high level of mass enthusiasm; thus, it has promoted the timely completion of spring drought resistance sowing, significantly improved farming standards, and greatly promoted the development of the rural cooperative mutual aid movement. It is particularly gratifying that a bumper harvest of wheat has been universally reported across the country, which is the first victory in this year's grain production increase. All regions should learn from the leadership experience of the spring production increase competition movement and continue to deepen this movement.

    Minister Li Shucheng then pointed out that since the summer, drought has been severe in many areas, and production has been tense and busy: drought resistance to protect seedlings, rush planting of late autumn crops, pest control, mid-cultivation and weeding, increased application of topdressing fertilizer, as well as cotton field pruning and branch removal, and flood prevention in areas prone to water damage are intertwined. This series of tasks is the key to determining a bumper harvest. Timely spring plowing and sowing have laid the foundation for a bumper harvest. If we can lead in depth in the summer, be good at uniting the broad masses of farmers, and give full play to their enthusiasm, and do a good job in drought resistance and other tasks, then the bumper harvest of agricultural products will be fully guaranteed. Some regions have already grasped this link of the summer patriotic production increase competition, and various agricultural activities, especially drought resistance work, are being carried out intensely; however, some cadres are satisfied with the achievements of the spring competition and have relaxed their leadership; and even individual regions still have laissez-faire and formalism phenomena. If we do not seize the opportunity to check and supervise, the current drought resistance production will fall into laissez-faire, causing undue losses to the work. Leading organs at all levels should mobilize urgently, concentrate all their efforts, go deep among the masses, and strengthen the leadership of the summer patriotic production increase competition.

    In order to enable the patriotic production increase competition movement to be carried out in depth and persistently, Minister Li Shucheng emphasized the following leadership links:

    1. Launch a drought resistance struggle. In drought-stricken areas, drought resistance work should be regarded as the overriding and most urgent task in the production increase competition. This work should be included in the production increase plan and used as the main condition for evaluation and inspection. In order to quickly mobilize the masses of farmers urgently and do a good job in checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, protecting seedlings, and summer sowing. In the drought resistance struggle, we should draw on the experience of last year, give full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and use all possible local conditions to ensure the complete realization of the agricultural production increase task.

    2. Rectify and develop cooperative mutual aid organizations. We should carefully organize all rural labor and livestock power to invest in drought resistance struggle and summer production activities, and improve labor efficiency in all aspects. Only in this way can we achieve victory in the busy and tense summer production; cooperative mutual aid organizations have developed greatly this spring, and we must strengthen leadership to consolidate them. We must scientifically arrange agricultural work, give full play to the superiority of being organized, actively educate farmers in collectivism through practical actions, and strive for all cooperative mutual aid organizations to persist and seek appropriate development in consolidation.

    3. Promote advanced high-yield experience. We should formulate a technical guidance outline that is practical and feasible for the local area based on the advanced high-yield experience created by high-yield models and the experience of drought resistance struggle, with state-owned farms as the core and labor models as the backbone, and carry out promotion and teaching work in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner under leadership. Inject the advanced high-yield experience into every major agricultural activity and gradually make it the local people's own farming habits. All regions should further promote the methods created in the spring production increase competition, such as establishing models, organizing visits, and chain demonstrations, and educate farmers with vivid examples to promote advanced experience well.

    4. Seize the opportunity for evaluation and inspection. All regions should immediately conduct an evaluation and inspection work to summarize the achievements and experiences of spring sowing and summer harvest, and reward high-yield models, in order to continuously consolidate and encourage farmers' patriotic enthusiasm and confidence in drought resistance and production increase. Regions with better conditions should also seize the gap in summer production and continue to organize one or two evaluations and inspections to ensure that the movement deepens step by step and the masses' enthusiasm remains persistent. In the evaluation and inspection, plans that are not realistic should be discussed and revised; and production difficulties should be helped to solve. This is an important link in educating the masses, improving cadres, improving leadership, and deepening the movement, and should be carried out conscientiously.

    5. Strengthen patriotic education for the masses of farmers and implement the publicity and explanation of various production policies. All regions should repeatedly educate cadres and farmers through various forms of publicity activities, clarify policies, and completely eliminate the paralysis and complacency in some districts and village cadres, as well as the conservative and "fear of increasing the burden" thoughts and concerns among farmers, in order to overcome formalism and laissez-faire phenomena in the competition movement and make the movement develop normally and steadily.

    Midsummer has arrived and time is pressing. Leading organs at all levels should seize this season, concentrate cadre strength to strengthen the leadership of the competition movement, so as to ensure that summer production work is done well, strive for a bumper autumn harvest, and create more favorable conditions for our country to enter large-scale economic construction.

    中央农业部李书城部长
    就农业爱国增产竞赛运动发表书面谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】全国农业季节已进入紧张阶段，坚决贯彻爱国增产竞赛，已成为决定胜利的重要关键。为引起各级领导机关对这一运动的重视，中央人民政府农业部李书城部长特就目前爱国增产竞赛运动的发展情况和问题发表书面谈话。
    李书城部长在谈话中首先指出：今年的爱国增产竞赛运动，已在全国范围内蓬勃地开展起来。这个运动的特点是目标明确、旗帜鲜明、群众情绪空前高涨；因而推动了春季抗旱播种适时完成，并显著地提高了耕作水平，大大促进了农村合作互助运动的发展。特别值得庆幸的是全国小麦普告丰收，这是今年粮食增产的第一个胜利。各地都应吸取春季增产竞赛运动的领导经验，把这一运动继续深入开展起来。
    李书城部长接着指出：夏季以来许多地区旱象严重，生产紧张繁忙：抗旱保苗、抢种晚秋、防治虫害、中耕除草、增施追肥，以及棉田整枝打杈和易受水害地区的防涝等各种农事活动相互交织。这一系列的工作，是决定丰收的关键。春耕春种适时，我们已经奠定了丰收的基础，如果我们能在夏季深入领导，善于团结广大农民，充分发挥其积极性，作好抗旱以及各种工作，那末农产品的丰收，就有了充分的保证。有些地区已经把握住夏季爱国增产竞赛这个环节，各种农事活动特别是抗旱工作正在紧张进行；但是也有些干部满足于春季竞赛的成绩，放松领导；甚至有个别地区还存在自流和形式主义现象，如不抓紧检查督促，目前的抗旱生产，将会陷于自流，使工作遭受不应有的损失。各级领导机关应该紧张动员起来，集中一切力量，深入群众，加强夏季爱国增产竞赛的领导。
    为使爱国增产竞赛运动能深入开展和持久地贯彻下去，李书城部长着重指出以下几个领导环节：
    一、开展抗旱斗争。在受旱地区应以抗旱工作作为增产竞赛中压倒一切的最紧迫的任务。此项工作应该列入增产计划，并以此作为评比、检查的主要条件。以便迅速地将农民群众紧急动员起来，全力作好查苗、补苗、保苗与夏播工作。抗旱斗争中应吸取去年的经验，发挥群众的智慧和力量，利用当地一切可能利用的条件，确实保证农业增产任务的彻底实现。
    二、整顿与发展合作互助组织。应该周密地组织农村全部劳畜力投入抗旱斗争以及夏季生产活动，从各方面提高劳动效率，只有这样，才能在繁忙、紧张的夏季生产中取得胜利；今春合作互助组织大量发展，必须加强领导进行巩固工作。要科学地安排农活，充分发挥组织起来的优越性，积极地通过实际行动，对农民进行集体主义的教育，争取所有的合作互助组织坚持下来，并且在巩固中求得适当的发展。
    三、推广先进丰产经验。应该根据丰产模范们所创造的先进丰产经验以及抗旱斗争的经验，结合当地实际情况，制订当地切实可行的技术指导纲要，以国营农场为核心，以劳动模范为骨干，有领导、有计划、有组织、有步骤地进行推广、传授工作。把先进丰产经验贯注到每一个主要的农事活动中去，逐渐成为当地群众自己的耕作习惯。各地更应推广在春季增产竞赛中创造的树立典型、组织参观、连环示范，以生动事例教育农民的方法，很好地把先进经验推广起来。
    四、抓紧评比检查。各地应立即进行一次评比、检查工作，总结春播、夏收的成就和经验，并奖励丰产模范，以便不断地巩固与鼓舞农民的爱国热情和抗旱增产的信心。条件较好的地区并且应该在夏季生产中抓紧空隙，继续组织一次至两次的评比、检查，保证运动步步深入，群众情绪持久不懈。评比、检查中，对一些计划不切合实际的要讨论修正；生产上有困难的要设法帮助解决。这是教育群众、提高干部、改进领导、深入运动的重要环节，应该认真进行。
    五、加强对农民群众进行爱国主义教育，贯彻各项生产政策的宣传解释。各地应通过各种形式的宣传活动，反复对干部和农民进行教育，讲清政策，彻底消除某些区、村干部中的麻痹、自满思想，以及农民中产生的保守和“怕加重负担”等思想顾虑，以便克服竞赛运动中的形式主义和自流等现象，使运动正常而巩固地发展起来。
    仲夏已至，时间紧迫，各级领导机关应抓紧这个季节，集中干部力量加强竞赛运动的领导。从而保证作好夏季生产工作，争取秋季丰收，为我们的国家进入大规模的经济建设创造更加有利的条件。
