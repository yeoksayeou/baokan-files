    A Child's Accusation
    Cao Ming
    Bao Lijun is already a twelve-year-old child, studying diligently and lively in elementary school. Her grandfather works at the Fushun Power Plant, and the family lives a very happy life. Every day after school, after finishing her homework, she takes her younger sister and brother to play, telling them the stories that the teacher told her. In those days, American planes were harassing Fushun, dropping many poisonous insects for days. The teacher had already told the elementary school students how American imperialism was using poisonous insects to kill Korean and Chinese children, and taught them how to prevent epidemics. Little Bao Lijun was very angry when she heard this: "We children have no grudges against anyone, how could American imperialism want to kill us?" But she also thought that imperialism is capable of all evils, and one must be careful. She warned her younger siblings not to pick up things to play with outside, and not to catch insects with their hands.
    One evening on March 9th, her nine-year-old sister, Bao Lirong, came back from playing outside and asked her older sister to scratch her back. She loved her younger sister very much, and she would do anything her sister asked. But that day, little Bao Lijun felt something was wrong, because no matter how hard she scratched, her sister kept saying it was unbearably itchy. So she said to her: "If I scratch harder, your skin will break. Did you play with something dirty outside?" Bao Lirong just shook her head. Lijun stopped when she got tired of scratching. Thinking that she had to go to school tomorrow, she left her sister and went to sleep. When she went to bed, she still felt very happy, thinking about what to do after going to school tomorrow morning, and how to play with her younger siblings after school. Alas! Who would have thought that misfortune would suddenly happen in the night! It turned out that Bao Lirong fell ill that night, with a high fever, vomiting yellow water, and confusion; she died the next morning. Later, after dissection by the Department of Pathology of the China Medical University, it was proved that she died of acute infectious encephalitis. This disease has never occurred in China before.
    When I visited the Bao family with the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare," Lijun and her mother cried out in anger. Little Lijun was so sad. She said: "On the evening of the ninth, my sister, brother, and I were playing happily, who would have thought that my sister would fall ill in the middle of the night and die the next morning. My sister died so quickly, it was like a dream to me. But my sister really died, and I will never see her again. A few days ago, my mother made a pair of shoes for each of us three, all the same. But because my sister died tragically, my mother was afraid that American germs would harm us again, so she burned my sister's clothes and shoes. Look, our shoes are still quite new. Whenever I see these shoes, I think of my sister, I think of the American devils, I really hate them! What kind of heart do they have, that they have to poison us children? That they have to destroy the happiness of our family? Please let the investigation team accuse the American devils of their crimes to the international community, and ask the big friends of the world to uphold justice and avenge my sister! Severely punish the American devils who spread germs!"
    Although little Lijun's words were simple, I knew how heartbroken and angry she was!
    It is the Wall Street financiers who dream of dominating the world all day long and do not hesitate to carry out inhuman germ warfare who have taken the lives of children. It is the bloodthirsty executioners in America who have destroyed the happiness of an ordinary and kind family.
    After listening to Bao Lijun's accusation, her grief has become my grief! Because I am a mother, and I also have children.
    Yes, which parents do not have lovely children? Which men and women do not have siblings? If the American aggressors can spread poisonous insects on the lands of China and Korea today, poisoning the children of China and Korea; who can guarantee that they will not poison those children in other countries tomorrow?
    In order to protect our future generations, I call on all compassionate parents around the world to unite closely and quickly stop the evil germ warfare being carried out by the American aggressors.
    Cao Ming's note: This story is all true. It's just that the name of the deceased has not been disclosed in the two reports of the "International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team" and the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare" and other domestic news. But I mentioned it in my article "Stopping the Atrocities of the American Aggressors" (see People's Daily, April 29).

    孩子的控诉
    草明
    鲍丽君已经是十二岁的孩子了，在小学念书，很用功，很活泼。她的祖父在抚顺发电厂做工，家庭生活过得很美满。她每天下课回家，做完了功课，就领着妹妹和弟弟玩耍，把老师给她讲过的故事给弟妹讲。那几天美国飞机正骚扰抚顺，连日投下许多毒虫。老师早就把美帝国主义怎样用毒虫杀害朝鲜孩子和中国孩子的阴谋告诉了小学生们，并教给他们如何防疫。小小的鲍丽君听了，心里很恼怒：“咱们小孩子跟谁都无仇无怨，美帝国主义怎么竟想害死咱们？”但是她也想到帝国主义是无恶不作的，不能不加小心。她就告诫了弟妹，不要在屋外乱拣东西玩，不要用手抓虫子。
    三月九日那一天晚上，她的九岁的妹妹鲍丽蓉从外面玩罢回来，要姊姊给她搔痒。她是非常爱妹妹的，妹妹求她什么，她一定得给她办到。但是那一天小鲍丽君觉得有点不对头，因为怎样用力搔，妹妹还说痒得不行。她就向她说：“我再用力搔，你的皮肤得破啦。你是不是在外头玩什么脏东西啦？”鲍丽蓉只是摇头。丽君抓得累了，就住了手。想起明天还得上课，她撩下妹妹就睡觉了。她睡下时，还觉得自己很幸福的，满脑子打算明天早晨上学后如何如何；下课回来，又怎样和弟妹一块玩。唉！谁想到不幸的事情就突然在夜里发生了！原来鲍丽蓉当天夜里就发了病，发高烧、呕吐黄水、迷糊；第二天早上就死掉了。后来经中国医科大学病理学系解剖，证明她是患急性传染性脑炎死的。这种病在中国从来没有过。
    当我随“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”访问鲍家的时候，丽君和她的妈妈都愤怒地哭诉了。小小的丽君是多么伤心呀。她说：“九号晚上我们姊妹弟弟三人玩得好好的，谁想半夜里妹妹就发了病，第二天早上就死掉了。妹妹死得那样快，我好像做了一个梦一样。可是我妹妹真的死啦，我永远见不着她了。妈妈头几天给我们三人各做了一双鞋子，都是一个样的。但是因为妹妹惨死，妈妈怕美国毒菌还会害我们，她就把妹妹的衣服和鞋子都烧掉了。你瞅，我们的鞋子还挺新的。我一看见这双鞋，我就想起我妹妹，我就想起美国鬼子，我真恨它！它安的什么心肠，硬要毒死我们小孩子？硬要破坏我们家庭的快乐？请调查团替我向国际控诉美国鬼子的罪行，请世界上的大朋友们主持公道，替我妹妹报仇！严惩撒细菌的美国鬼子！”
    小丽君的话虽然说得很简单，但是我知道她是多么痛心，又多么愤怒！
    夺去了儿童生命的是华尔街那些成天梦想霸占全世界，不惜进行惨无人道的细菌战的财阀们。破坏一个普通善良家庭的幸福的，是美国那些杀人不见血的刽子手们。
    听了鲍丽君的控诉，她的哀痛已成为我的哀痛了！因为我是个母亲，我也有孩子。
    是的，那一个父母没有可爱的儿女？那一个男女没有兄弟姊妹？美国侵略者今天能够把毒虫撒到中朝的国土上，毒害中朝的儿童；谁又能保证它明天不在别的国家里去毒害那些儿童们？
    为了保卫我们的后一代，我呼吁全世界的慈心的父母们，紧紧团结起来，迅速制止美国侵略者所进行的罪恶的细菌战。
    草明注：这段故事都是真人真事。只是死者的名字未在“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”和“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团的两个报告以及国内其他新闻里披露过。但在我所作“制止美国侵略者的暴行”（见四月二十九日人民日报）一文中曾提到过。
