Local State-Owned Grain Companies Should Cherish Local Grain and Eliminate Waste

To the Editor: Many state-owned grain companies' warehouses have accumulated a lot of "native grain" (i.e., grain that was scattered on the ground and then collected). Warehouse keepers have not actively sought ways to process this grain, resulting in some of it becoming moldy and spoiled.

The waste of sacks and tarpaulins is also very serious in local grain companies. The Sizhuang Cooperative in Weixian County, Hebei Province, used grain company sacks to block rat holes and windows. While this is certainly the fault of the Sizhuang Cooperative in Weixian County, the grain company's failure to stop it is also wrong. The Xiajin Grain Depot Exchange in Shandong Province used sacks to block doors. Cadres and guards of the San Cha Bu Grain Company in Huangpi County, Hubei Province, used new sacks as mattress pads and door curtains. More than 6,500 sacks stored in the Huangchuan office in Henan and the Tunxi Linning office in Anhui were damaged by rats. The Wuhe office in Su County spoiled six tarpaulins. The Bengbu Grain Company used tarpaulins to cover discarded mats and used tarpaulins to line the ground when unloading grain.

These are all serious acts of damaging state property. I suggest that local state-owned grain companies conduct thorough inspections to eliminate the accumulation of native grain and the waste of packaging materials. You Dashui

    各地国营粮食公司应爱护土粮并杜绝浪费现象
    编辑同志：各地粮食公司仓库，积存土粮（即撒在地面上又收起的粮食）很多。仓库保管人员没有积极设法处理这些土粮，以致有些土粮已经霉坏变质。
    各地粮食公司浪费麻袋、苫布的现象也很严重。河北省威县寺庄合作社用粮食公司麻袋堵鼠洞、堵窗户，这固然是威县寺庄合作社的错误，但粮食公司没有加以制止，也是不对的。山东省夏津粮栈交易所，用麻袋堵门；湖北省黄陂三汊埠粮食公司的干部和警卫人员，用新麻袋垫床铺、做门帘；河南潢川和安徽屯溪林宁办事处所存麻袋，被老鼠咬坏了六千五百多条。宿县五河办事处霉坏了六块苫布。蚌埠粮食公司以苫布苫盖废席，卸车时用苫布铺地接粮。
    这些都是严重损害国家财产的行为。我建议各地国营粮食公司深入检查，杜绝积存土粮和浪费包装用具的现象。　尤大水
