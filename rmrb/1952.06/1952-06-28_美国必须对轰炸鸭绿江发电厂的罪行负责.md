    The Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plants, located on the border between Korea and China, were subjected to a large-scale and frenzied bombing by the U.S. invading air force on the 23rd of this month. This is a major provocation by the United States to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations and further endanger peace in Asia and the world; it is another major crime against humanity committed by the American aggressors. The people of the world who love peace and uphold justice must not sit idly by in the face of such lawless atrocities by the American aggressors, and must unite to inflict severe punishment on the American criminals.

    The U.S., having learned a bitter lesson from its disastrous defeat in the Korean War for two years, cannot but recognize that this "most costly and bloodiest war" waged by the U.S. has already failed; according to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 24th, "on the second anniversary of the Korean War, authoritative sources predict that nothing more than a stalemate can be achieved either on the battlefield or in the armistice negotiations." Why are they unwilling to accept an armistice in Korea and insist on maintaining the "stalemate"? This is clearly because the American aggressors fear that a genuine armistice would hinder their continued creation of international tension and the implementation of their global aggression plan of expanding armaments and preparing for war. Therefore, they adopt all kinds of unreasonable attitudes and deliberate provocations to delay and disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations. On the one hand, they repeatedly fail to attend meetings; on the other hand, they wantonly humiliate and massacre our unarmed prisoners of war. Now they are even bombing our peaceful construction--hydroelectric power plants--which have no military equipment. Is this a "demonstration" of the military power of the American aggressors? Absolutely not! This can only be an expression of the extreme cowardice and extreme shamelessness of the American aggressors.

    The American aggressors cannot find any reason for the crazy bombing of the Yalu River Power Plants. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett stated on the 24th, after admitting that this bombing was "approved in advance by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff," that the bombing was of "a military target." This is clearly a complete and utter lie. Anyone with a little common sense knows that hydroelectric power plants are completely peaceful constructions unrelated to military affairs, and they are to supply the needs of the vast peaceful people. There, there is no military equipment at all, and therefore, it cannot be a "military target." All U.S. reports on this bombing have admitted that the Yalu River Power Plants are peaceful constructions with no "military target" to speak of. An Associated Press dispatch on the 23rd proudly described the scene of American planes carrying out "low-altitude bombing" in batches, and quoted Chase, the commander of the Operations Group of the Eighth Fighter-Bomber Wing of the U.S. Air Force, as saying: "That was a very beautiful target, beautiful weather, we bombed it to pieces." The people of the world should all listen: the heinous American bandits are so cruelly regarding the Yalu River Power Plants, which are essential to the lives of millions of peaceful people, such a peaceful and beautiful construction, as a so-called "military target," and "bombing it to pieces." How shameful the evil intention of thoroughly undermining the peaceful life of the vast number of people has reached can be imagined from this.

    The American aggressors' adoption of such extremely barbaric and despicable means to bomb the Yalu River Power Plants, a non-military target, is an attempt to exert their so-called "military pressure," which has long gone bankrupt, in order to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people, vainly hoping to gain what they cannot gain at the Korean armistice negotiation table. But, as people know, from MacArthur's "Christmas Offensive" to Ridgway's "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive," all have suffered miserable defeats under the strong blows of the Korean and Chinese people. All the so-called "military pressure" of the American aggressors can only end in bankruptcy.

    The American aggressors, while delaying and disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations, are also frantically bombing the Yalu River Power Plants, which proves that they are deliberately expanding the Korean War and threatening peace in Asia and the world. The American aggressors must bear absolute responsibility for the serious consequences that will be caused by this heinous crime. This supreme crime against humanity must be severely punished by the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world!

### 美国必须对轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的罪行负责

    美国必须对轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的罪行负责
    位于朝鲜和我国边境的鸭绿江水力发电厂，于本月二十三日遭受了美国侵朝空军大规模的疯狂轰炸。这是美国破坏朝鲜停战谈判、进一步对亚洲及世界和平的一个极大的挑衅；这是美国侵略者违反人道的又一次最大的犯罪行为。全世界爱好和平、维护正义的人民，决不能坐视美国侵略者这种无法无天的暴行，必须一致起来予美国罪犯们以严厉的惩罚。
    美国在侵朝战争两年来惨重失败的教训中，不能不认识到美国所进行的这“一次代价最大、流血最多的战争”是已经失败了的；据路透社东京二十四日的电讯，“在朝鲜战争的两周年，权威人士都预料无论在战场上或停战谈判中都不能获得比僵持局面更胜一筹的东西”了。为什么他们不肯接受在朝鲜停战，而要保持“僵持局面”呢？这显然是因为美国侵略者害怕一个真正的停战，会妨碍其继续制造国际紧张局势，推行其扩军备战的世界侵略计划。于是他就采取各种横蛮无理态度和蓄意挑衅手段，来拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判。他一方面，一次又一次的逃会；另一方面，又向着手无寸铁的我方被俘人员大肆凌辱与屠杀。现在他更向着我方毫无军事设备的和平建设——水力发电厂滥肆轰炸。这是美国侵略者军事力量的“示威”吗？完全不是！这只能是美国侵略者极端卑怯极端无耻的一种表现罢了。
    美国侵略者疯狂轰炸鸭绿江发电厂是找不出任何理由的。美国的国防部长罗维特二十四日发表谈话，在承认这个轰炸是“事先得到了美国参谋长联席会议批准的”之后，他说轰炸的“是一个军事目标”。这分明是彻头彻尾的撒谎。稍有常识的人都懂得，水力发电厂完全是与军事无关的和平建设，它是供给广大和平人民的生活需要的。在那里，根本没有军事的设备，也就根本不能成为什么“军事目标”。所有美国方面关于这次轰炸的报道都已经承认鸭绿江发电厂乃是和平建设，毫无“军事目标”之可言。美联社二十三日电讯中洋洋得意地描述美国飞机一批一批地进行“低空轰炸”的情形，并且引述美国空军第八战斗轰炸机联队作战大队队长蔡斯的话说：“那是一个很美丽的目标，美丽的天气，我们把它炸得稀烂了。”全世界人民都应该听着：万恶的美国强盗就是这样残忍地把千百万和平人民生活所必需的鸭绿江发电厂，把这样一个和平的美丽的建设，当做所谓“军事目标”，而“把它炸得稀烂了”。他们企图破坏广大人民和平生活的彻底违反人道的罪恶用心，达到了多么可耻的地步，由此更可以想见了。
    美国侵略者采取如此极端野蛮卑鄙的手段，轰炸一个非军事目标的鸭绿江发电厂，乃是企图施展它的早已破产了的所谓“军事压力”，借以恫吓朝中人民，妄想取得他在朝鲜停战谈判桌上所不能取得的东西。但是，人们都知道，从麦克阿瑟的“圣诞节攻势”到李奇微的“夏季攻势”、“秋季攻势”，都在朝中人民的坚强打击下，遭受了悲惨的失败。美国侵略者的一切所谓“军事压力”，都只能得到破产的结局。
    美国侵略者一面拖延破坏朝鲜停战谈判，一面疯狂轰炸鸭绿江发电厂，这证明他是在蓄意扩大朝鲜战争，威胁亚洲与世界的和平。对于这一万恶罪行所将引起的严重后果，美国侵略者必须负绝对的责任。他的这一违反人道的绝顶罪行，一定要受到朝中人民和世界人民的严厉的责罚！
