To implement Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy, and to rapidly launch a patriotic production increase and economy practice movement in the entire North China region on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, in preparation for the upcoming large-scale national economic construction, the Government Administration Council of the North China Administrative Committee convened the North China Industrial Production Competition Conference from June 11th to 15th. Responsible cadres from the People's Governments, enterprise Party committees, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues of the five provinces and two municipalities of North China, as well as from the province-affiliated cities, and heads of major state-owned factories and mines in North China attended the conference. Responsible individuals from relevant central and North China-level agencies and organizations were also invited to attend and provide guidance.

At the meeting, Director Liu Lantao first gave a clear and concise speech. He said: "The 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements in the North China region, which lasted for about half a year, have achieved historically significant results and have now concluded victoriously. At present, the overriding central task facing governments at all levels and the entire people is to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas on the basis of the victory of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements, in order to strengthen economic construction. All other work must be subordinate to and serve this general task. Economic construction work should focus on leading production, especially industrial production. In order to strengthen the leadership of industrial production and prepare for the large-scale economic construction that is about to come, it is necessary to strengthen the following aspects of work: (1) Strengthen planning work; (2) Strengthen industrial administrative leadership organizations; (3) Strengthen the grassroots organizations of factories and mines; (4) Further enhance the role of trade union work; (5) Train and promote a large number of cadres."

Regarding the patriotic production increase and economy practice competition movement to be fully launched in the North China region on July 1st, Director Liu Lantao pointed out: "This industrial production competition movement has significant political significance for developing production, promoting urban-rural exchanges, strengthening the country's economic and defense capabilities, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, strengthening internal unity among the people, and enhancing the leading role of the working class. At the same time, it also plays a very important role in the production reform and political reform of state-owned and public-owned factories and mines. During the movement, many backward things will inevitably be broken, and countless new heroic deeds and new creations will emerge. Therefore, the competition movement itself is a struggle between the advanced and the backward, between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, we must also be highly vigilant against the sabotage of counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, leading cadres must lead this competition movement with a clear mind, with preparation, planning, steps, and purpose, and adopt a positive and steady approach; they should put forward different competition goals and priorities according to the production situation and product sales of each factory and mine, so that this competition movement can achieve complete victory."

Subsequently, Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng gave a report on "Carrying out the Patriotic Production Increase and Economy Practice Competition Movement in the Entire North China Region." In his report, he clearly put forward two major tasks for this competition movement: (1) To implement Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy, resolutely implement the instructions of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on carrying out the production increase and economy practice competition movement, and strive to increase production and practice economy by 4 trillion yuan in state-owned and public-owned factories and mining enterprises in the next six months. (2) To promote production reform through competition and lay a solid foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the economic accounting system. Liu Xiufeng emphasized that only by relying on the vast number of workers and staff to promote various advanced experiences and implement technical verification, these two most central links, can the above tasks be completed.

The meeting held a heated discussion on the reports of Director Liu Lantao and Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng. Responsible individuals from the CPC provincial and municipal committees, provincial and municipal people's governments, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues delivered speeches one after another; representatives from factories and mines in Nankou, Tangshan, Shijingshan, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and other places made typical reports on advanced experiences and advanced work methods such as "determining working hours," "rapid maintenance," "burning inferior coal," and "formulating plans." After discussion, all the representatives unanimously believed that the reports of Director Liu Lantao and Deputy Director Liu Xiufeng fully met the actual needs, and everyone was determined and confident to guarantee the completion of the glorious tasks given by the conference. In order to solve the problems of product sales, material supply, safety equipment, medical and health care, and employee dormitories raised at the meeting, the North China Administrative Committee immediately convened a special study by the responsible persons of various provinces and cities after the meeting to solve them.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this competition movement, the North China Administrative Committee decided to organize the "Patriotic Production Increase and Economy Practice Competition Movement Committee," with Liu Lantao as the director, Liu Xiufeng as the deputy director, and Huang Huoqing, Liu Ren, Guo Hongtao, Li Zheren, Yang Cheng, Kang Yonghe, Xu Shiping, Ma Shi'an, Tian Xiujuan, and Ma Qingzao as members. The committee also established a competition office to be responsible for daily work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    政务院华北行政委员会召开华北区工业生产竞赛会议
    政务院华北行政委员会为贯彻毛主席增产节约的伟大号召，在“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上迅速地开展华北全区爱国增产节约运动，为将要到来的全国大规模经济建设作好准备，于六月十一日至十五日召开了华北区工业生产竞赛会议。出席这次会议的有华北五省二市及省属市的人民政府、中共省（市）委企业党委、工会、青年团等负责干部以及华北各大国营厂矿的负责人。会议并邀请了中央及华北级有关机关、团体的负责人莅会指导。
    会上，刘澜涛主任首先作了明确扼要的讲话。他说：“华北区历时半年左右的‘三反’、‘五反’运动获得了具有伟大历史意义的成就，现已胜利结束。目前摆在各级人民政府和全体人民面前的压倒一切的中心任务，是在‘三反’、‘五反’运动胜利的基础上，全力发展工农业生产，促进城乡物资交流，以加强经济建设工作。其它一切工作，都必须服从和服务于这个总任务。经济建设工作，应以领导生产特别是工业生产为中心。为了加强工业生产的领导，迎接将要到来的大规模的经济建设，必须切实加强以下几方面的工作：（一）加强计划工作；（二）加强工业行政领导机构；（三）加强厂矿的基层组织；（四）进一步发挥工会工作的作用；（五）大量培养和提拔干部。”
    对于华北全区“七一”全面展开的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，刘澜涛主任指出：“此次工业生产竞赛运动，对于发展生产，促进城乡交流，增强国家经济力量与国防力量，巩固工农联盟，加强人民内部的团结，提高工人阶级的领导作用，都具有重大的政治意义。同时，它对于国营和公营厂矿企业的生产改革与政治改革，也有极重要的作用。运动中必将打破许多落后的东西，涌现出无数新的英雄事迹和新的创造。因此，竞赛运动本身，是一个先进与落后、工人阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争过程，同时对反革命分子的破坏亦必须提高警惕性。因此，领导干部必须以清醒的头脑，有准备、有计划、有步骤、有目的地来领导这次竞赛运动，采取积极的和稳步前进的方针；应根据各厂矿企业的生产情况及产品销路，提出不同的竞赛目标和重点，使这次竞赛运动取得完满的胜利。”
    接着，刘秀峰副主任作了“关于开展华北全区爱国增产节约竞赛运动”的报告。他在报告中对此次竞赛运动明确地提出了两大任务：（一）贯彻毛主席增产节约的伟大号召，坚决执行中共中央华北局关于开展增产节约竞赛运动的指示，为今后半年内在国营和公营工厂、矿山企业内增产节约人民币四万亿元而奋斗。（二）通过竞赛推动生产改革，为全面实行经济核算制打好基础。刘秀峰强调指出：只有依靠广大职工群众推广各种先进经验和实行技术查定这两个最中心的环节，才能完成上述任务。
    会议对刘澜涛主任、刘秀峰副主任的报告展开了热烈的讨论。中共各省市党委、各省市人民政府、工会、青年团的负责人先后作了发言；南口、唐山、石景山、天津、太原等厂矿代表作了关于“查定工时”、“快速检修”、“烧劣质煤”、“订立计划”等先进经验和先进工作法的典型报告。经过讨论，全体代表一致认为：刘澜涛主任、刘秀峰副主任的报告完全切合实际需要，大家有决心并有信心保证完成大会所给予的光荣任务。为了解决会议中所提出的产品销路、材料供应、安全设备、医药卫生及职工宿舍等问题，会后华北行政委员会随即召集各省市负责人专门作了研究，加以解决。
    为了加强对此次竞赛运动的领导，华北行政委员会决定组织“爱国增产节约竞赛运动委员会”，由刘澜涛任主任，刘秀峰任副主任，黄火青、刘仁、郭洪涛、李哲人、杨成、康永和、许世平、马适安、田秀娟、马清藻任委员。委员会下并设竞赛办公室，负责进行日常工作。　（新华社）
