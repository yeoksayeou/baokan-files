    Kalinin on Communist Morality
    Zhang Tengxiao
    Today is the sixth anniversary of Comrade Kalinin's death. Kalinin was an outstanding figure in the communist movement, one of the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party, and a great, talented educator and propagandist. He was not only good at vividly and lively instilling the great ideals of communism and the various policies of the Party into the masses, turning them into guidelines for mass action, but also made many creative expositions in education, such as the purpose of education, its nurturing nature, comprehensive development, and communist morality. Therefore, he improved the effectiveness of education work and enriched the content of pedagogy. He will forever have a brilliant place in the treasure house of pedagogy.
    Regarding the issue of communist morality, Kalinin made thorough, simple, and systematic discussions in articles such as "On the Moral Character of Our People," "On Communist Education," and "Be a Comprehensively Developed Person." He believed that communist morality plays a huge role in consolidating the socialist social system, promoting socialist construction, and overcoming the remnants of capitalist ideology in people's minds.
    What is morality? Kalinin said: "In the early stages of human society, morality grew out of living conditions, and in practice, gradually formed the criteria for people's behavior. Of course, these criteria were not explicitly stipulated as any regulations, knowing that there was no writing at that time; however, people at that time should have abided by these criteria, probably no less than we should abide by modern written regulations. As relationships with communes, clans, families, relationships between men and women, and life relationships became increasingly consolidated, they became generally recognized psychological norms and social morality." This means that morality existed before class society.
    Since human society was divided into classes, morality has become the morality of the class, and has become a powerful tool for the ruling class to enslave the ruled masses. Here, Kalinin quoted Engels' famous point: "Since society has hitherto developed in class contradictions, morality has always been the morality of the class; it either defends the rule and interests of the ruling class, or reflects the indignation expressed by the oppressed class—but the sufficiently powerful oppressed class—in opposing this rule, and defends the future interests of the oppressed." This means that in class society, there is no unified standard of morality. Although the ruling class says "the interests of the people" and "public morality" in order to conceal their rule, in fact, this is completely lying, completely using their own narrow class interests to impersonate the interests of the whole people, and using the morality of the exploiting class to impersonate the morality of all mankind. In the eyes of the ruling class, exploiting others, harming others for personal gain, and speculation are all reasonable moral behaviors. However, the struggle of the working class and peasant masses against cruel exploitation and oppression is considered unreasonable and immoral. The working class and peasant masses think the opposite. They believe that in order to survive, they must finally eliminate the system of exploitation, free themselves from shackles, and believe that this is a just moral behavior. For example, workers believe that it is extremely shameful to undermine the unity of the working class, inform on capitalists, and sell out the interests of the working class; they consider it justifiable to retaliate against scabs, secret agents, and informers. Therefore, Lenin once pointed out that "criticizing the bourgeoisie, developing the masses' hatred for the bourgeoisie, raising class consciousness, and being good at uniting the strength of their own class" is the basic content of the working class's morality in capitalist society.
    The great October Revolution elevated human morality to the highest stage. With the elimination of the old classes in the Soviet Union, human society began to transform its life according to socialist principles. Now, every Soviet citizen has a high moral level, lofty ideals, and a noble spiritual life. I remember reading in a book that someone asked Soviet children: "If you buy goods for a hundred rubles today, you can earn the same amount tomorrow, would you like to earn money this way?" These children replied: "Such people should be punished by law." They believe that exploiting the labor of others without working themselves is the most shameful behavior. However, the establishment, consolidation, and development of this morality is not natural, but the result of a long-term struggle against the remnants of capitalist ideology. Marx said that people's consciousness lags behind economic development, so people's "spiritual habits and customs cultivated by landlords and the bourgeoisie for hundreds of years" cannot be completely eliminated at once by revolution alone. It must go through long-term efforts and conscious ideological transformation to gradually overcome the remnants of capitalist ideology and establish a new communist morality.
    Regarding what the standards of communist morality are, Kalinin put forward the following four aspects.
    "Love of labor is one of the main components of communist morality." Kalinin said: "If a person worked well before the Soviet system, then he was objectively helping the capitalist system, which is to say, he was tightening the shackles of slavery around his own neck and the neck of the entire working class. But now, in socialist society, if a person works well, then he is standing on the side of socialism and using his achievements not only to clear the road to communism, but also to break the slave chains on the world proletariat. He is also an active fighter for communism." Therefore, in socialist society, people's attitude towards labor has undergone a fundamental change. They believe that labor is no longer "suffering," no longer something to be looked down upon, but a "glorious and heroic cause."
    In socialist society, Kalinin believes that increasing labor productivity is "one of the main directions of class struggle" and a "powerful weapon for Soviet laborers in their struggle against capitalism." The results of the laboring people's struggle to increase labor productivity should not only be reflected in the quantity of production, but also in the quality. Kalinin said in his popular language: "Communism is: as many products as possible, and as good quality as possible." The products that Kalinin mentioned here are "not only the products of physical labor, but also the products of mental labor, that is, the labor products of engineers, architects, writers, teachers, doctors, actors, artists, musicians, singers, etc." This means that in socialist society, all people engaged in physical and mental labor should use their high labor efficiency to produce more and better products for society. The reason why Stakhanov workers are respected and loved is because they treat labor with a communist attitude, and they produce more and better products for everyone. The reason why outstanding writers and literary workers enjoy a high prestige among the people is because they create works loved by the people through tenacious labor. Therefore, the phenomenon of always doing worse for the public than for oneself, and of producing shoddy work and being irresponsible to readers when creating, is all because of a lack of a communist attitude towards labor, which is a lack of communist morality.
    Secondly, communist morality is to cherish public property. In the old society, the theft of public funds and property was an open secret. Capitalist society is a society that wastes the property of the people and wastes human labor. Kalinin believes that only communist society is the most property-loving society in human history. Because in communist society, the distribution and consumption of products is in the hands of the producers, and they will naturally be much more thrifty when consuming these products than when exploiting and plundering the property of others.
    Therefore, to see whether a person is a true communist and whether he possesses communist morality, one must look at his attitude towards public property. Those who directly steal state property, destroy public property, and harm the interests of the public for personal gain, not to mention, are traitors to the country; for such people, Kalinin said, they should be punished according to law. Even those who do not put public property first, and do not treat public property as cherishly as their own property, are not truly possessing communist morality.
    Third, cherish the socialist motherland. Kalinin believes that Soviet patriotism must be distinguished from national chauvinism and the "patriotism" of the upper echelons of the ruling class. National chauvinists and the upper echelons of the ruling class are actually using the guise of patriotism to carry out national oppression and create national hatred. Soviet patriotism is closely linked to internationalism. That is, to cherish one's own motherland, promote all the excellent culture and traditions of one's own motherland; at the same time, respect other nationalities and their excellent culture and traditions, and establish mutually attractive relationships.
    Fourth, the spirit of collectivism. In communist education, cultivating the spirit of collectivism occupies a very important position. Because capitalist society is individualistic, while socialist society is built on the basis of collectivism. Kalinin said that the spirit of collectivism should become an integral part of our habits and codes of conduct. He said that any talented person will accomplish nothing if he leaves the collective and the strength of the collective.
    Communist morality is the morality of the highest stage of human society. Today, China is still in the stage of a new democratic society, and we cannot use this moral standard as a guideline for the actions of the people of the whole country; but the moral outlook of the people of New China is changing rapidly with the victory of the people's great revolution. All old morality is increasingly bankrupt in the spiritual life of the people of the whole country, especially in the spiritual life of the working class and peasant masses, and new morality has gained a dominant position among them. It should be admitted that the progress of the people of the whole country, especially the progress of the working class and peasant masses, in the past three years has surpassed that of many years in the past. The vast majority of people have closely linked their personal interests with the interests of the people and the motherland, and this great spiritual force is powerfully promoting the development of the construction cause of New China. In order to continue to improve the moral level of the people, we should be good at using the spirit of communist morality to educate the broad masses of the people and expand the propaganda of communist morality, so as to more effectively promote the development of the construction cause of New China.

    加里宁论共产主义道德
    张腾霄
    今天是加里宁同志逝世六周年纪念日。加里宁是共产主义运动中的卓越人物，是苏联共产党的领导人之一，也是伟大的天才的教育家和宣传鼓动家。他不但善于把共产主义的伟大理想、党的各种政策，生动活泼地贯输到群众中去，变为群众行动的指针；而且在教育方面，譬如：对于教育的目的、教育的培养性、教育的全面发展以及共产主义道德等都有许多创造性的论述，因而提高了教育工作的效能，丰富了教育学的内容。在教育学的宝库中将永远有他光辉的地位。
    关于共产主义道德问题，加里宁在“论我国人民底道德面貌”、“论共产主义教育”、“要成为全面发展的人”等文章中，曾经作了深入浅出的系统的论述。他认为共产主义道德在巩固社会主义社会制度中，在推动社会主义建设中，以及在克服人们资本主义思想残余中，是有着非常巨大的作用的。
    什么是道德？加里宁说道：“在人类社会初期，道德从生活条件中成长起来，在实践上逐渐构成人们行为底准则。当然，这种准则，并没有明文规定为任何法规，须知当时还没有文字；然而那时人们曾应遵守这些准则，大概并不亚于我们应遵守现代的成文法规。对公社、宗族、家庭的关系、男女关系、生活上的关系既已日趋巩固，于是就变成了公认的心理轨范和社会道德。”这就是说，道德在阶级社会以前就产生了。
    自从人类社会划分为阶级以后，道德就成为阶级的道德，就成为统治阶级奴役被统治群众之强有力的工具。在这里，加里宁转引了恩格斯的著名论点：“既然社会至今都是在阶级矛盾中发展着，所以道德从来都是阶级的道德；它或者辩护统治阶级底统治及利益，或者反映被压迫阶级——但已经是充分强大的被压迫阶级在反对这一统治时所表示的愤激心理，并捍卫被压迫者将来的利益。”这就是说，在阶级社会里，统一的道德标准是不存在的。统治阶级为了掩饰自己的统治，尽管说什么“人民的利益”“公共的道德”，实际上这完全是撒谎，完全是以自己的狭隘的阶级利益来冒充全民的利益，以剥削阶级的道德冒充全人类的道德。在统治阶级看来，剥削他人、损人利己、投机取巧都是合理的道德的行为。而对于工农劳动群众所进行的反对残酷剥削和压迫的斗争，反认为是不合理不道德的行为。工农劳动群众则恰恰相反，他们认为为了生存就必须最后消灭剥削制度，解脱自己身上的枷锁，并认为这是正当的道德的行为。譬如：工人认为破坏工人阶级的团结，向资本家告密，出卖工人阶级的利益，是极其可耻的；对于工人殴打工贼、暗探、告密者等认为正当的报复。所以列宁曾经指出：“批判资产阶级，发展群众对资产阶级的仇恨心，提高阶级觉悟，善于团结本阶级的力量”，就是在资本主义社会里工人阶级道德的基本内容。
    伟大的十月革命把人类的道德提升到最高的阶段。随着旧的阶级在苏联的被消灭，人类社会开始按照社会主义原则改造自己的生活。现在每一个苏维埃公民都有很高的道德水平，远大的理想，高尚的精神生活。我记得在一本书上说：有人问苏联的少年儿童说：“今天你用一百个卢布买成货物，明天便可以赚到同样的数目，你愿意这样赚钱吗？”这些少年儿童回答说：“这样的人应该依法惩办。”他们认为自己不劳动而剥削他人的劳动，是一种最可耻的行为。然而这种道德的确立、巩固和发展，不是自然而然的，而是长期同资本主义思想残余斗争的结果。马克思说过，人们的意识是落后于经济发展的，所以人们“那种种由地主资产阶级几百年来所薰陶的精神习惯和风俗”，绝不能单靠革命就能够一下子消灭干净的，必须经过长期的努力，自觉的思想改造，才能逐渐克服资本主义的思想残余，树立新的共产主义的道德。
    关于什么是共产主义道德的标准，加里宁提出了以下四个方面。
    “爱好劳动是共产主义道德主要成分之一。”加里宁说：“如果说，在苏维埃制度以前，一个人作工作得很好，那他同时在客观上是帮助了资本主义制度，也就是把奴隶的枷锁更加牢固地套在自己和整个工人阶级的颈脖上。但现今在社会主义社会里，如果一个人作工作得很好，那他就是站到社会主义方面，并用自己的成绩不仅清除通共产主义的道路，而且还打破着套在世界无产阶级身上的奴隶锁链。他也就是为共产主义而斗争的积极战士。”所以在社会主义社会里，人们的劳动态度已经有了根本的转变。他们认为劳动不再是“受苦”，不再是被人瞧不起的事，而是一种“光荣和英雄的事业”。
    在社会主义社会里，加里宁认为提高劳动生产率，是“阶级斗争的主要方向之一”，是“苏联劳动者在与资本主义作斗争中的雄强武器”。劳动人民在为提高劳动生产率而进行的斗争，其成果不仅要表现在生产的数量方面，而且还要表现在质量方面。加里宁以其通俗的语句说道：“共产主义就是：产品尽量多，质量尽量好。”加里宁这里所说的产品，“不只是体力劳动底产品，而且是智力劳动底产品，即工程师、建筑师、作家、教师、医生、演员、美术家、音乐家、歌唱家等人底劳动产品”。这就是说，在社会主义社会里，一切从事体力劳动和智力劳动的人民，都要以自己高度的劳动效率为社会生产又多又好的产品。斯达哈诺夫工作者之所以受到尊敬和爱戴，是因为他们以共产主义态度对待劳动，他们为大家生产了又多又好的生产品。优秀的作家、文艺工作者之所以在人民中享有很高的威信，是因为他们以顽强的劳动创造了为人民所喜爱的作品。所以那种给公家劳动总要比给自己劳动差一些的人，在创作时粗制滥造，对读者不负责任的现象，都是因为缺乏共产主义的劳动态度，也就是缺乏共产主义的道德。
    其次，共产主义道德就是爱护公共财产。在旧社会里，盗窃公款公物的行为是公开的秘密。资本主义社会乃是浪费人民财产以及浪费人的劳动的社会。加里宁认为只有共产主义社会才是人类历史上最爱护财产的社会。因为在共产主义社会里，生产品的支配和消费是操在生产者的手里，他们在消费这些生产品时，自然要比剥削和掠夺他人财产的要节省得多。
    所以要看一个人是不是真正的共产主义者，有无具备共产主义的道德，就要看他对于公共财物的态度。那些直接盗窃国家财产，破坏公物，为个人利益而损害公家利益的，就不必说了，这是国家的罪人；对于这种人，加里宁说，应该依法惩治。就是不把公家财产放在第一位，对待公家的东西总不能像对待自己的东西一样的爱惜，也是没有真正具备共产主义道德的表现。
    第三，爱护社会主义祖国。加里宁认为苏维埃的爱国主义，必须和民族沙文主义，和统治阶级上层分子的“爱国主义”区别开来。民族沙文主义者和统治阶级上层分子实际上是用爱国主义的幌子来进行民族压迫和制造民族仇视的勾当。苏维埃的爱国主义是和国际主义密切相联系的。就是说，爱护自己的祖国，发扬自己祖国一切优秀的文化和传统；同时还要尊重别的民族以及他们的优秀的文化和传统，并且要建立互相吸引的关系。
    第四，集体主义精神。在共产主义教育中，培养集体主义精神，占着很重要的地位。因为资本主义社会是个人主义的，而社会主义社会则是建立在集体主义基础上的。加里宁说，应该使集体主义精神在我们习惯和品行规范中成为不可分割的一部分。他说，任何有才干的人如果离开了集体和集体力量都将是一事无成的。
    共产主义道德是人类社会最高阶段的道德。今天中国仍处在新民主主义社会的阶段，我们还不能以这种道德标准作为全国人民行动的轨范；但新中国人民的道德面貌，随着人民大革命的胜利，正在急剧地转变。一切旧的道德，在全国人民的精神生活中，特别是在工农劳动群众精神生活中日益破产，新的道德在他们中间已经取得了统治的地位。应该承认，三年来，全国人民的进步，特别是工农劳动群众的进步要胜过以往许多年。绝大多数人把个人的利益和人民祖国的利益已经紧密地联系起来了，这种伟大的精神力量正在有力地推动着新中国建设事业的发展。为了继续提高人民的道德水平，我们应该善于用共产主义道德的精神教育广大的人民，扩大共产主义道德的宣传。以便更有效地推进新中国建设事业的发展。
