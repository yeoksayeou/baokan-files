Answering Readers' Questions on Preferential Treatment for Veterans

Editor's Note: Our newspaper has recently received many letters from readers asking about preferential treatment for veterans. We now provide a comprehensive response as follows:

Question: Should township cadres enjoy the benefits of substitute farming?

Answer: The main task of township cadres is to lead the masses in production. Therefore, they themselves should actively participate in production and play a leading and exemplary role. Township cadres working in their own townships or villages are generally able to find time to participate in production. It is true that some township cadres are currently very busy and do not have time to participate in production. However, this situation can be gradually changed by improving leadership and working methods. For township cadres who are particularly busy with work, their treatment should be appropriately adjusted, or other duties should be reduced or exempted. Therefore, we believe that township cadres should not enjoy the benefits of substitute farming.

Question: Should revolutionary soldiers who were wounded or disabled in combat or on duty be called "Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers" or "Honorary Soldiers"?

Answer: In the past, revolutionary soldiers who were wounded or disabled in combat or on duty were generally called "Honorary Soldiers." Since the promulgation of the Common Program, according to Article 25 of the Common Program, they should be called "Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers." Article 2 of the "Provisional Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Compensation for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government on December 11, 1950, also clearly stipulates that all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces who are disabled due to combat injuries or on duty shall be called Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers.

Question: Can Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers enjoy preferential treatment when traveling by train? What kind of preferential treatment is available?

Answer: The "Provisional Measures for Preferential Treatment for Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Traveling by Train" promulgated by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government stipulates that Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers can purchase half-price military tickets upon presentation of their disability certificates and a travel introduction letter issued by the People's Government above the district level of their registered residence. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has also issued a notice stating that Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers are entitled to half-price fares when traveling by train. Therefore, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers who hold the above-mentioned documents can enjoy half-price preferential treatment when traveling by train.

Question: Can students at Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' schools and recuperation centers use military postage to send letters free of charge?

Answer: Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' schools and recuperation centers belong to the government system. Students in these institutions should not use military postage to send letters free of charge.

    关于优抚工作的几个问题
    编者按：本报最近收到很多读者来信，询问有关优抚工作的一些问题，现综合答复如下：
    问：乡干部是否应该享受代耕待遇？
    答：乡干部的主要任务是领导群众生产，因此，他们自己应该积极参加生产，在生产中起带头作用和模范作用。乡干部在本乡或本村工作，一般是能够抽出时间参加生产的。现在有些乡干部确实工作繁忙，没有时间参加生产；这种情况，只要改进了领导方法和工作方法，还是可以逐步改变的。对于某些工作特别繁重的乡干部，应该适当地调整待遇，或者减免其他勤务。因此，我们认为，乡干部不应该享受代耕待遇。
    问：因参战负伤或因公残废的革命军人，应称做“革命残废军人”还是“荣誉军人”？
    答：凡革命军人因参战负伤或因公残废者，过去一般地称为“荣誉军人”。共同纲领颁布以后，根据共同纲领第二十五条的规定，应称为“革命残废军人”。中央人民政府内务部一九五○年十二月十一日公布的“革命残废军人优待抚恤暂行条例”第二条也明确规定：凡人民解放军及人民公安部队之指战员，因参战负伤或因公而致残废者，均称革命残废军人。
    问：革命残废军人乘坐火车，是否可享受优待？怎样优待？
    答：中央人民政府铁道部颁布的革命残废军人乘车优待暂行办法规定：革命残废军人凭残废证并持有籍属区以上人民政府开具之乘车介绍信者，可以购买军人半价票。中央人民政府内务部也曾发出革命残废军人乘坐火车享受半价优待的通知。因此，革命残废军人如持有上述证件，乘坐火车可以享受半价优待。
    问：革命残废军人学校、教养院的学员，是否可以使用军邮免费寄信？
    答：革命残废军人学校、教养院属于政府系统，这些院校的学员不应该使用军邮免费寄信。
