    We Continue to Improve Cotton Planting Techniques During Spring Sowing
    Cotton Model of High Yield, Wu Xuanwen
    Our mutual aid team had already finished sowing twenty mu of cotton fields and transplanting rice seedlings on eight mu and two fen of paddy fields by May 17th. Now (May 27th), my cotton seedlings have been above ground for two weeks. They are emerging neatly and growing quite vigorously, with no blemishes on the cotyledons.

    Although I created a high yield record of 881 jin of seed cotton per mu last year, I was still an individual farmer at that time. My labor efficiency was not high, and my technical knowledge was insufficient. Therefore, there were still many shortcomings in cultivation techniques: seed selection was not thorough enough, the sowing period was too late, the depth of plowing was insufficient, the amount of phosphate fertilizer was insufficient, and nitrogen fertilizer was applied too sparingly to general land. The Communist Party and the People's Government provided me with correct guidance, which raised my political consciousness. This spring, I organized a small mutual aid team. We established various systems based on voluntarism and mutual benefit, and brought into play the spirit of unity and fraternity. We also continuously learned from advanced experiences, humbly accepted technical guidance from the farm, and adopted new-style farm implements. Our production enthusiasm and cultivation level have both improved further. Based on my original high-yield experience and addressing the shortcomings that still existed in last year's production, our mutual aid team formulated this year's patriotic increase production pact and high-yield plan.

    The main contents of our patriotic high-yield plan are as follows:

    (1) High-yield target: For the whole team's 20 mu of cotton fields, strive for an average yield of 600 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 71% compared to last year; of which at least three mu of land should produce more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. Other crops should also increase production, guaranteeing 460 jin of rice per mu for paddy rice, an increase of 60 jin compared to last year; 120 jin per mu for six mu of sesame, an increase of 30 jin compared to last year.

    (2) Soil preparation: In addition to winter plowing twice, spring plow three times. After the third spring plowing, according to the terrain, make fish-back-shaped ridges (high in the middle, slightly lower at both ends) (furrow ditch is two chi wide and one chi deep) to facilitate drainage.

    (3) Fertilization: During the first spring plowing, apply about 100 dan of pond mud or ditch mud per mu; during the second spring plowing, apply 100 jin each of chicken manure and bean cake per mu; during the third spring plowing, apply 500 jin of dried lake grass and 1,000 jin of human manure per mu. At the time of sowing, dig pits or open ditches to apply fire fertilizer (burned from sod, fallen leaves, livestock manure, garbage, etc.) 30 dan per mu (the fire fertilizer in high-yield land is mixed with one-twentieth of fish fertilizer - ground dried small fish powder), bone meal 80 jin to 100 jin. When the first flower buds appear, apply a top dressing of 50 jin of rotted bean cake mixed with 10 jin of fish fertilizer; when the first flowers bloom, apply another top dressing of 50 to 60 jin of the same fertilizer.

    (4) Sowing, intertillage: Use pure strain Dai Zi Cotton No. 15 selected from last year's high-yield land. Before sowing, select the grains, and soak them in warm water and mix them with plant ash; sow five to seven days before the Beginning of Summer (立夏). Thin the seedlings three times. Cultivate and weed six to nine times, removing weeds before the plum rain season. Earth up two to three times, hilling four cun high.

    (5) Pest and drought prevention: Before the cotton seedlings emerge, use sodium fluosilicate to control cutworms; in early June, use "DDT" or "666" to control mirid bugs; for other pests and diseases, use pesticides to control them immediately upon discovery. During the hot season, water frequently and cover the base of the cotton plants with lake grass (using about 300 jin of lake grass per mu) to prevent the cotton seedlings from being affected by drought.

    (6) Pruning and leaf removal: According to the growth of the cotton plants, do a good job of cotton plant management. For sparse row and plant spacing, pay attention to pinching the top buds to promote the development of the lower fruit branches; for dense spacing, pay attention to removing leaf branches and side shoots to promote upward growth. Leaf removal should be carried out from the end of August to the beginning of September.

    Before sowing, we carried out full preparations. In terms of accumulating fertilizer: Every morning I took the lead in collecting sod and livestock manure, and as a result, the whole team burned a total of 12,900 jin of fire fertilizer with these things. We built a new manure cellar to store a large amount of human manure and urine, etc., allowing it to fully ferment and rot; we also bought a boat (small boat) to transport human manure and other fertilizers to Pengze County; we prepared a total of more than 2,000 jin of human manure and urine. We borrowed 4,000 jin of bean cake, of which 1,400 jin were kept as top dressing, and the rest were applied to the fields as base fertilizer during spring plowing and sowing, exceeding the original plan. The application of other fertilizers has been completed according to the plan, more than double that of last year. In terms of soil preparation: In addition to generally completing the plan, the high-yield land was plowed and harrowed once more at the time of sowing. In other aspects, everything went smoothly according to the plan. The seeds were disinfected with "Ceresan" and a germination test was carried out, which was a step further than originally planned. Not many cutworms were found, and we used the method of trapping and killing them with piles of grass, saving the sodium fluosilicate that was originally planned to be used.

    The continuous spring rains broke our plan to sow before the Beginning of Summer. On May 8th, three days after the Beginning of Summer, we began sowing. Even so, the sowing period was about half a month earlier than last year.

    Before sowing, I participated in a technical research conference held by the Pengze Cotton Farm, and received guidance on advanced techniques. We studied Qu Yaoli's experience, summarized last year's lessons, and had a further understanding of close planting, so we revised the original plan regarding plant spacing. When sowing on high-yield land, we used a rope to measure the distance and implemented a quincunx point sowing method. Last year, fertilizer was spread all over the ground when sowing. This year, for all 20 mu of cotton fields, we first dug a hole about two cun deep to apply base fertilizer, and then dug a shallower hole to sow the seeds (the two holes were three or four cun apart); at the same time, we covered the seeds with some fire fertilizer and stepped on it firmly to prevent the soil from crusting when there was too much rain, ensuring that the cotton seedlings emerged neatly. This kind of meticulous sowing is more labor-intensive. However, because we initiated and participated in the patriotic production increase competition this year, everyone's production enthusiasm is very high. On the first day, three and a half laborers sowed three mu of high-yield land. During the sowing season, we got up at the crack of dawn every day, and it was not until we plowed more than one mu of land that it dawned. Using the ox that the People's Government awarded me last year, I plowed and harrowed the land that needed to be planted every day in the morning. Our high-yield cotton fields emerged completely on May 13th, and the cotton seedlings in the rest of the fields also emerged completely in less than a week.

    Our actions have motivated the nearby peasant brothers, and I also often publicize the principles of patriotic production increase to the masses in my village (Yangjiazu). The production enthusiasm of the masses in Furong Township, Pengze County, has become greater than in the past. Sixty percent of the farmers in the township have adopted my cultivation methods; our entire village has also formulated a high-yield plan to increase the yield by 33.3% compared to the normal yield of 150 jin of seed cotton per mu, reaching an average yield of 200 jin of seed cotton per mu; the entire village also guarantees that there will be 15.5 mu of high-yield land producing 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    我们在春耕播种中继续改进植棉技术
    棉花丰产模范  吴宣文
    我们互助组已经在五月十七日把全组二十亩棉田和八亩二分稻田播种插秧完毕。现在（五月二十七日）我的棉苗出土已有两个星期了，棉苗出得整齐，生长得颇为茁壮，子叶上没有一点病斑。
    我去年虽然创造了每亩收获籽棉八百八十一斤的丰产纪录，但那时我还是个单干农民，劳动效率不高，技术知识不够，所以在耕作培植技术上还有许多缺点：选种不够认真彻底，播种期太晚，耕地的深度不够，磷肥配合量不足，一般地的氮肥施得也很少，行距株距太大，没有进行整枝摘心打叶等工作。共产党和人民政府对我进行了正确的指导，提高了我的政治觉悟。今春，我就组织了一个小型互助组。我们在自愿两利的基础上建立了各种制度，发挥团结友爱的精神；并且不断学习先进经验，虚心接受农场的技术指导，采用了新式农具，生产热情和耕作水平都更加提高了。我们的互助组根据我原有的丰产经验，并针对去年生产中还存在的缺点，订立了今年的爱国增产公约和丰产计划。
    我们今年的爱国丰产计划的主要内容如下：
    （一）丰产目标：全组棉田二十亩，争取平均每亩产籽棉六百斤，比去年增加百分之七十一；其中至少有三亩田每亩要产籽棉一千斤以上。其他作物也要增产，保证水稻每亩产稻谷四百六十斤，比去年增产六十斤；六亩芝麻每亩产一百二十斤，比去年增产三十斤。
    （二）整地：除已冬耕二次外，要春耕三次。第三次春耕后，依照地形，做成鱼背形（中间高，两头稍低）的畦（畦沟宽二尺，深一尺），以利排水。
    （三）施肥：第一次春耕时，每亩施塘泥或阴沟泥约一百担；第二次春耕时，每亩施鸡粪、豆饼各一百斤；第三次春耕时，每亩施干湖草五百斤，人粪尿一千斤。播种的时候，挖坑或开沟施火肥（用草皮、落叶、畜粪、垃圾等烧成）每亩三十担（丰产地的火肥中并拌入二十分之一的鱼肥——干小鱼磨成的粉），骨粉八十斤到一百斤。第一次见花蕾的时候，施一次追肥，把腐熟的豆饼五十斤和鱼肥十斤混合施用；到刚开花时，再施一次追肥，施用同样的肥料五六十斤。
    （四）播种、中耕：用去年丰产地里选出的岱字棉十五号纯种，播种前经过粒选，并用温汤浸种、草木灰拌种；在立夏前五天到七天播种。间苗三次。中耕锄草六次到九次，在霉雨季节以前把杂草除净。培土两次到三次，培四寸高。
    （五）防虫、防旱：在棉苗没有出土时，用氟矽酸钠防治“地老虎”；六月初，用“滴滴涕”或“六六六”防治“盲椿象”；对别的病虫害，一经发现就立即用药剂除治。伏天要勤浇水，在棉株根旁盖湖草（每亩约用湖草三百斤），不使棉苗受旱。
    （六）整枝、打叶：依照棉株生长情况，做好棉株修理工作。行株距离稀的，注意打顶尖，好叫下部果枝发展；密的，注意打叶枝和边心，好叫它向上发展。打叶工作在八月底到九月上旬进行。
    播种前，我们进行了充分的准备工作。在积肥方面：我每天早晨带头积集草皮、畜粪，结果全组用这些东西共烧了一万二千九百多斤火粪。我们新砌了一口粪窖，大量存储人粪尿等，使它充分发酵腐熟；还买了一只划子（小船），到彭泽县城运人粪尿等肥料；我们总共准备了人粪尿两千多斤。我们贷到了四千斤豆饼，除一千四百斤留作追肥以外，都在春耕播种时施在地里做基肥，施用数量超过了原计划。其他肥料的施用，都完成了计划，比去年增加了一倍以上。在整地方面：除一般地完成了计划以外，丰产地在播种时还多耕耙了一次。在其他方面，都顺利地按照计划进行。种籽用了“赛力散”消毒，而且做了发芽试验，比原计划更进了一步。“地老虎”发现的不多，我们用堆草诱杀法就把它们消灭了，把原计划要用的氟矽酸钠节省了下来。
    春雨连绵，把我们立夏前播种的计划打破了。到五月八日，立夏后三天，我们开始播种。虽然如此，播种期比去年还是提早了半个月左右。
    播种以前，我参加了彭泽棉场召开的技术研究会，接受了先进技术的指导。我们研究了曲耀离的经验，总结了去年的教训，对密植有了进一步的认识，就修改了原定的关于株距行距的计划。我们在丰产地上播种时，用绳子量好距离，实行了梅花式的点播。去年播种时施肥是满地撒，今年二十亩棉田都是先掘一个约二寸深的穴下基肥，然后掘一个较浅的穴下种籽（两穴相距三、四寸）；同时用一些火粪盖在种籽上，用脚踏实，以免雨水多时土面板结，保证棉苗出土整齐。这样细致地播种，是比较费工的。但是，因为我们今年发起并参加了爱国增产竞赛，大家的生产劲头很足，第一天用三个半劳动力就把三亩丰产地播好了。在播种时期，我们每天都是鸡鸣而起，耕了一亩多地才天亮。我用着去年人民政府奖给我的一头牛，把每天要种的地，在上午耕好耙好。我们的丰产棉田五月十三日出齐了苗，其余地里的棉苗不到一个星期也都完全出土。
    我们用行动带动了附近的农民弟兄，我还经常向本村（杨家嘴）群众宣传爱国增产的道理，彭泽县芙蓉乡群众的生产劲头比过去大了起来。全乡百分之六十的农户都采用了我的耕作方法；我们全村也订了丰产计划，要比常年产量每亩一百五十斤籽棉增产百分之三十三点三，达到平均每亩产二百斤籽棉；全村还保证有十五亩五分丰产地每亩产籽棉一千斤。（江西省彭泽棉场黄庭理代笔）
