Spring sowing has been basically completed throughout the country. Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "Increase Production, Practice Economy, to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the broad masses of peasants launched a patriotic production increase emulation movement, successfully achieved timely spring sowing, and laid a good foundation for increasing the yield per unit area of farmland this year. This year, throughout the country, under the guideline of increasing yield per unit area and not expanding cotton fields, the sown area of major grain crops and cotton is generally in line with the state's plan. As of now, grain and cotton crops in the entire North China region have been sown long ago, and cotton seedlings are growing vigorously everywhere. In the East China region, all autumn crops planted in provinces north of the Huai River have sprouted to a height of two or three inches. Cotton fields and major autumn crops in the Northwest region have also completed sowing. The Northeast region has completed field sowing and has now begun rice transplanting. In the Central South, Southwest, and rice-producing areas of East China, early rice transplanting has been completed long ago, and some areas are already transplanting mid-season rice. Now, summer hoeing is gradually unfolding in various places.

Since the beginning of spring this year, people's governments at all levels have led peasants in preventing drought, conserving soil moisture, and preparing for spring plowing, creating extremely favorable conditions for spring sowing. In early February, peasants in North China launched a movement to conserve soil moisture and prepare the land, allowing spring plowing to begin early. In the Southwest region, during the spring drought, more than ten million organized peasants participated in the fight against drought, thus ensuring that more than 90% of rice fields were transplanted in a timely manner. This spring, peasants in Northwest provinces built more than 7,800 small canals and dug nearly 30,000 wells, increasing the irrigated area by more than 850,000 mu. Simultaneously with the start of soil moisture conservation and drought prevention, peasants throughout the country, driven by labor models and advanced mutual aid organizations, launched production competitions between counties, districts, townships, villages, groups, and households, ensuring the smooth completion of spring plowing and sowing. The famous labor model Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, Lü Hongbin, Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative, and Chen Yongkang and other mutual aid groups, who jointly challenged the nation's peasants to compete, all completed spring plowing and sowing ahead of schedule, inspiring the production enthusiasm of peasants everywhere. In the Northeast region, after widespread spring rains in mid-to-late April, Rehe Province launched a sowing "shock week," and peasants, led by Communist Party members, Youth League members, mutual aid groups, and active elements, launched challenge and response competitions. Therefore, by the end of April, field crops such as sorghum and millet had all been sown. In the East China region, due to the widespread development of production competitions, spring sowing this year was generally seven to ten days earlier than in previous years. Although a large number of peasants in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu participated in the Huai River management project, they still completed sowing without missing the farming season. Currently, only the northern Sichuan area of the Southwest region has not yet fully completed spring sowing due to drought.

The biggest characteristic of this year's spring plowing and sowing is that under the slogan of increasing yield per unit area, the broad masses of peasants have all attached importance to intensive farming, increasing fertilization, changing to improved varieties, and adopting scientific and advanced production methods. The amount of fertilizer applied in the cotton-growing areas of North China is generally 10% to 20% higher than last year. This year, cotton farmers in Pingyuan Province sowed 5 million jin of the Si-character improved cotton variety. In Jie County, Shanxi Province, the hometown of the famous cotton high-yield model Qu Yaoli, all 115,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have been plowed three times and harrowed eight to nine times. The area of cotton fields applying fine fertilizer, bone fertilizer, and fertilizer powder has increased tenfold compared to last year. Cotton seeds have all been carefully selected, with a purity reaching 90%. The amount of cotton seeds sown per mu is one-third more than in the past, and the number of seedlings retained per mu has increased from less than 2,000 in the past to about 3,000. Qu Yaoli's method of full seedling even sowing and close planting has been implemented in all cotton fields. Farmers in rice-growing areas have widely sown improved varieties. This year, the promotion of improved rice varieties in Hunan Province has expanded from 18 counties last year to 49 counties. Farmers in southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang have adopted Chen Yongkang's advanced method of "sparse rice seeds" and dense transplanting for sowing and transplanting. In ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, sowing this year has mostly changed from broadcasting to row sowing. Peasants in various places have also established many small farms and research associations to conduct experiments on improving farming techniques and varieties. After learning advanced production techniques, farmers have strengthened their confidence in completing production increases.

Currently, farmers in many places are launching appraisal campaigns to summarize spring plowing and sowing experience in order to promote summer hoeing competitions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国各地春季播种已经基本完成
    全国各地春季播种已经基本完成。广大农民在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召下，开展爱国主义增产竞赛运动，胜利地做到了适时春播，为今年农田单位面积增产打下了良好的基础。今年全国各地在提高单位面积产量，不扩大棉田面积的方针下，主要粮食作物和棉花的播种面积，一般是符合国家的计划的。截至目前，华北区全区粮、棉作物早已播种完毕，各地棉田出苗茁壮。华东区淮河以北各省所种的各种秋作物，都已出苗二、三寸高。西北区棉田以及大秋作物也已完成播种。东北区完成了大田播种，现在已开始水稻插秧。中南、西南各地以及华东产稻区，早稻插秧早已完毕，有些地区已在插中稻。现在各地夏锄已逐渐展开。
    今年入春以来，各级人民政府领导农民防旱、保墒和准备春耕，给春播创造了极其有利的条件。华北各地农民在二月初即开展了一个保墒整地的运动，使春耕得以提早开犁。西南区在春旱期间，仅有组织的农民就有一千万以上参加了抗旱，因此保证了百分之九十以上的稻田适时插秧。西北各省农民，今年春天兴修了小型水渠七千八百多条、打井近三万眼，增加灌溉面积八十五万多亩。与保墒、防旱开始的同时，全国各地农民在劳动模范和先进互助组织的带动下，展开了县、区、乡、村、组、户间的生产竞赛，保证了春耕播种的顺利完成。联名向全国农民挑战竞赛的著名劳动模范李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社、吕鸿宾、金时龙农业生产合作社和陈永康等互助组，都超计划提前完成了春耕播种，激发了各地农民的生产热情。东北区在四月中、下旬普降春雨后，热河省即开展了播种突击旬，农民们在共产党员、青年团员、互助组和积极分子的带动下，开展了挑战应战竞赛，因此，到四月底，高粱、谷子等大田作物都已种完。华东区由于广泛开展了生产竞赛，今年春播一般比往年提早了七天到十天。皖北、苏北虽有广大农民参加了治淮工程，但是仍然不误农时地完成了播种。现在只有西南川北区因天旱尚未完全完成春播。
    今年春耕播种的最大特点，是广大农民在提高单位面积产量的口号下，都重视了精耕细作、增加施肥、改种良种和采用科学的先进生产方法。华北棉区的施肥量，一般比去年增加一成到二成。平原省棉农，今年播种斯字优良棉种达五百万斤。著名棉田丰产模范曲耀离的家乡——山西省解县，全县十一万五千亩的棉田，都耕过三遍，耙、耱了八遍到九遍。施用细肥、骨肥和肥田粉的棉田，比去年增加了十倍。棉籽都经过精选，纯度达到百分之九十。每亩播种棉籽比过去多三分之一，每亩留苗由过去的二千株以下，增至三千株左右，全部棉田实行了曲耀离的全苗匀种、密植的方法。稻田区的农民广泛播种优良品种。湖南省今年水稻良种推广，已由去年的十八个县，扩大到四十九个县。苏南、浙江等地农民的播谷、插秧，都采用了陈永康的“落谷稀”和插秧密的先进方法。新疆、宁夏等少数民族地区，今年播种也多已改撒播为条播。各地农民还建立了许多小农场和研究会，作改进耕作技术和品种的试验。农民们学会了先进生产技术后，增强了完成增产的信心。
    目前，许多地方的农民正展开评比运动，总结春耕播种经验，以推动夏锄竞赛。　（新华社）
