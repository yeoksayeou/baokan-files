What I Saw in Korea
By French Writer, Kelade Luo'a

The June sun shone on the boundless ruins of Pyongyang. A young child stood at the entrance of a cave, gazing at me with curiosity and fear. His family lived among the scattered piles of broken bricks and tiles.

Faced with this scene of devastation and the child's bleak gaze, I couldn't help but wonder: What is it that my eyes and heart find most unbearable?

A piercing question swirled in my mind: Why? Why? Why?

Those Westerners who still doubt the crimes of germ warfare, the facts of bloodshed, destruction, and devastation in Korea, cannot help but ponder and dispel their doubts in the face of these scenes.

Because even before the use of bacteriological weapons (and for a long time before), the war waged by the Americans in Korea had completely lost its military character. This is no longer a classical war or a modern war, the purpose of which is to attack the enemy's military forces, to eliminate and weaken the enemy's military strength. It's not even the so-called "total war" of the Second World War—which not only attacked the enemy's military forces, but also attacked the enemy's industry, transportation, and communication hubs across the board.

No. Since the beginning of their aggression, the war waged by the so-called "United Nations" forces in Korea is not a war, but an act of extermination. Only the German Nazis and Japanese militarists could have conceived of the deeds that the "United Nations" forces are doing in Korea today. What is happening in Korea today is germ warfare. The Americans, with the most prominent hypocritical face, advocate "liberating" the Korean people. Even from the perspective promoted by the United States regarding the Korean War, a mere glance is enough to show that this is not only a completely indefensible war, but also absolutely a monstrous crime. Against whom exactly are the American planes, artillery, and troops fighting? Is it against an army, against a government, against a policy, or against an economic system?

None of these. It is against the people of a nation.

They want to exterminate the people of a nation, to wipe them off the face of the earth. Under the slogans of "humanitarianism" and "anti-communism," they are conducting a systematic and methodical massacre of the people of a nation.

What Ives Farge and I saw in Korea exceeded all the brutal facts we could encounter in our lives. I had lived in French cities that had been turned to ashes by Hitler's bombing. I had traveled through German cities occupied by Allied forces, from Aachen on the Belgian border to Berlin. The whole world knows how the Nazi army turned Warsaw into a ruined and devastated desert. However, all of this pales in comparison to what has happened in Korea. The Americans have turned many parts of Korea into a scorched earth, without exception. On a poor and primitive land, they have applied all the technically most vicious, most brutal and inhumane means to carry out destruction.

They carried out planned, methodical destruction, first destroying large cities, then small cities, and finally destroying the countryside. Their targets of attack were first soldiers, then civilians, women, and children. They threatened the Korean people with atomic bombs, driving them by the thousands and tens of thousands onto the roads; then, the Americans strafed these innocent masses. Those who escaped death were crowded into concentration camps of hunger and death. Other unfortunate prisoners encountered slaughter and starvation in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island.

Fire, iron, fraud, and slaughter could not achieve their goals, so they spread plague among the living to complete their "mission."

From Sinuiju to Pyongyang, from the north to the central part of Korea, shame and sorrow often made my throat feel constricted. I felt ashamed to be a contemporary of such despicable criminals. I felt sorrow because I witnessed such tragic suffering. At this time, I thought affectionately of my comrades in Paris, who were imprisoned because they treated Ridgway with the treatment a war criminal deserved; I thought of the French people who were fighting for truth and justice. The truth is: the American aggressors are the executioners who slaughter Korea; justice is that this heinous crime must be stopped immediately and that those who are responsible for this crime must never again engage in crimes that harm humanity.

However, these executioners are not the victors. This is the most profound impression we got during our journey. Despite the fact that the Korean people have been attacked by the world's most modern and powerful weapons, suffered casualties, poisoning, hunger, and destruction—the Korean people are still a victorious people. These farmers, whose cattle and sheep were stolen or slaughtered, whose land was poisoned; these workers, whose factories were destroyed; these soldiers, whose weapons were fewer and less complete than those of the enemy; this small and poor nation, which had not yet been completely liberated from the shackles of the Japanese, had already begun to build their new country, and today they have defeated the powerful American fleet, causing it to flee in disarray.

When I shook hands with the last Korean friend who accompanied us to the border to say goodbye, I felt that I was shaking hands with the embodiment of the noblest qualities possessed by a nation that could be a model for the world. These qualities are: confidence, courage, invincible strength, and a belief in the power of the people and the greatness of man, built on a rational foundation.

This small nation is a great nation. It bleeds, suffers, and even dies, but it never bows its head in surrender. I saw women doing men's work in the rice paddies. I saw teams of workers working day and night, regardless of bombing raids, to repair bridges and roads and to rush to repair railways. I saw the almost invisible entrances to underground factories, hospitals, schools, and universities in the midst of the destroyed ruins. In the deep underground labyrinths, temporarily excavated with explosives and human courage in a few weeks, people continued to manufacture weapons, treat wounded soldiers and civilians harmed by gasoline bombs; students also continued to attend classes here. Life above ground continued. Despite the frenzied attacks of bombers, transport teams still bravely marched to the front. The Pyongyang Museum was first looted by the Americans and then burned by them. I saw Korean archaeologists continuing to work in the underground studio of this museum, studying the murals in an ancient tomb recently discovered in northern Korea. I saw a team of Korean soldiers in the shade of a tree in a valley organizing a reading session after drills, with the literate teaching the illiterate to read. No, the Korean people have not been defeated. Only Ridgway and his fellow murderers have suffered a shameful defeat.

Their reputation is disgraced. They are isolated. The "United Nations" flag is just a false pretense. A small group of mercenaries from three or four countries cannot constitute a union of the countries of the world. However, when we come into contact with the heart of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, we feel the beating of the active heart of the people of the world. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, like athletes, are active and quick, fighting shoulder to shoulder with their Korean brothers. We cannot help but admire their bravery and discipline. The impression they give as an army is indeed that of a unified will, an experienced, capable, and efficient army. I think that the volunteer army during the French Revolution in 1792 and this army must have many characteristics in common.

I recall again an evening near Pyongyang. Several of us friends were in a command post hidden in the woods. Among them was a young Chinese volunteer soldier who had originally been a liberal arts student. There was a Hungarian doctor who worked in a field hospital donated to Korea by the Hungarian people. There were also six Korean officers and soldiers. There was also a Soviet journalist, a Polish surgeon, who was a plastic surgeon, working day and night to try to close the eyelids of people whose faces had been damaged by gasoline bombs. In addition, there was a Chinese bacteriology expert, who, along with his Korean brothers, was fighting to eradicate the scourge spread by the Americans. And there was a young Romanian diplomat and myself, a French writer.

We talked about the war, the brutal facts of the war, and the future. One of us quietly sang the tune of the Internationale. Everyone sang along with his voice. The Koreans sang in Korean, the Chinese in Chinese, the Hungarians in Hungarian, the Soviets in Russian, the Romanians and Poles in their native languages, and I in French. The pronunciations were all different, but the tune and the meaning were the same.

I heard the vast masses singing the Internationale. I have never been more moved than at this moment. The Internationale of Pyongyang, the song of hope whispered by people everywhere, amidst the vestiges of destruction…

    我在朝鲜所看到的
    法国作家　柯莱德·罗阿
    六月的太阳照耀着一望无边的平壤废墟。一个幼童站在那地洞的口上，带着好奇和惊惶的目光向我凝视。他的家庭就在这些破碎砖瓦的零乱堆中生活。
    面对这个残破的凄凉景象和儿童的惨淡的目光，我不禁寻思：什么最使我的视觉和心灵不能忍受？
    一个刺心的问题在我脑里盘旋：为什么？为什么？为什么？
    那些对于细菌战的罪行，对于朝鲜流血、破毁、炸光的事实仍抱怀疑的西方人们，在这些景象面前也不能不使他们沉思，把怀疑扫净。
    因为，甚至在使用细菌武器以前，（并且是很久以来），美国人在朝鲜所进行的战争已经完全失掉了军事的性质。这已不是一个古典的战争或是一个现代战争，其目的已不在于攻击敌方的军事力量，消灭和削弱敌人的军力。甚至也不是第二次大战时的所谓“全面战争”——不仅攻击敌人的军事力量，对于敌人的工业、运输、交通枢纽一概进行攻击。
    不是的。所谓“联合国”军队，自从它们的侵略开始，在朝鲜所进行的战争并不是一个战争，而是一个灭绝杀绝的行动。只有德国的纳粹党人和日本军国主义者才会想得出今天“联合国”军在朝鲜所干的勾当。今天在朝鲜所发生的事是细菌战。美国人以最突出的虚伪面貌倡言“解放”朝鲜人民。即使用美国所宣传的观点来看朝鲜战争，只要一瞥就可以看出，这不仅是一个完全不能够维护的战争，而且绝对是一个滔天罪行。美国的飞机、大炮、军队究竟是对谁作战？是对一个军队、对一个政府、对一个政策，还是对一个经济制度呢？
    都不是的。是对一个国家的人民。
    他们要把一个国家的人民灭绝，从地面上清洗掉。在“人道主义”和“反共”的口号下对一个国家的人民进行有方法有步骤的屠杀。
    依维斯·法奇和我两人在朝鲜所看见的超过了我们生平所能遇到的一切残暴事实。我曾经在遭受希特勒的飞机轰炸变成灰烬的法国城市里生活过。我曾经走遍了盟国军队所驻扎的德国城市，从比利时边境的亚森直到柏林。全世界的人都晓得纳粹党军怎样把华沙化为一个残破瓦砾的沙漠。然而所有这些在朝鲜面前都要显得逊色了。美国人把朝鲜许多地方不折不扣地变成为一片焦土。在一块贫穷的原始的土地上，他们应用了所有一切技术上最凶恶、最残暴不仁的手段来进行毁灭。
    他们根据预定计划，有步骤有方法地进行破坏，先毁灭大城市，然后小城市，最后毁灭乡村。他们的攻击对象，首先是兵士，然后是平民、妇女和儿童。他们拿原子弹来威胁朝鲜人民，把他们成千成万地赶到大路上；然后，美国人便向这些无辜的群众进行扫射。那些幸免于死的人们便堆挤在饥饿和死亡的集中营里。另一些不幸被俘的人便在巨济岛的俘虏营中遭遇屠杀和饥饿。
    火、铁、欺诈和屠杀不能达到目的，他们便向还活着的人们散布瘟疫，这样来完成他们的“事业”。
    从新义州到平壤，从朝鲜的北部到中部，耻辱和伤痛，使我的喉咙时常感到紧缩。我因为做着这样卑鄙罪犯的同时代人而感觉到耻辱。我因为亲眼看见这样悲惨的痛苦而感到伤痛。这时我亲切地想到在巴黎的同志们，他们被关在监牢里，因为他们以对一个战争贩子所应得的待遇去接待李奇微；我想到法国的人民在为真理与正义进行斗争。真理就是：美国侵略者是屠杀朝鲜的刽子手；正义就是必须立刻停止这个凶恶罪行并且要使那些对这罪行负责的人们从今以后永远不能再从事损害人类的罪行。
    不过，这些刽子手们并不是胜利者。这就是在我们的旅途中给我们印象最深的一件事。尽管朝鲜人民遭受世界上最新式最强有力武器的攻击，伤亡、中毒、饥饿、毁灭—朝鲜人民仍然是胜利的人民。这些农民，他们的牛羊被盗窃或被屠杀，土地染上了毒素；这些工人们，他们的工场被摧毁；这些兵士们，他们的武器比起敌人的武器来数量少而且不完备；这个弱小而贫穷的民族在还没有完全从日本人的桎梏解放出来的时候便已开始建设他们的新国家，而今天他们又使美国的强大舰队遭遇失败，望风披靡。
    当我和那陪伴我们到边境的最后一位朝鲜朋友握手道别时，我感觉到是和一个足以为世界模范的民族所具有的最高贵品质的化身在握手。这品质是：自信、勇敢、不可征服的力量，建筑在理性基础上的对人民的力量和对人的伟大所抱的信念。
    这个弱小民族是一个伟大民族。他流血、遭受痛苦、甚至死亡，然而他绝不低头屈膝。我看见在稻田里妇女做着男人的工作。我看见工人的队伍不顾飞机的轰炸日夜不停地在修桥补路和抢修铁道。我看见在破毁的废墟中间的地下工厂、医院、学校和大学的几乎看不见的出口。在临时用炸药和人的勇气在几个星期内挖掘成功的深邃的地下迷宫里，人们继续制造武器，医治受伤的战士和受到汽油弹灾害的平民；学生也继续在这里上课。地面上的生活仍然在继续。不顾轰炸机的猖狂攻击，运输队仍然勇敢地走上前方。平壤博物馆起先被美国人抢掠后来又被他们所烧毁。我看见朝鲜的考古学家就在这个博物馆的地下工作室里继续工作，研究最近在朝鲜北部发现的一座古墓中的壁画。我看见在一个山谷里的树荫下一队朝鲜兵士在演习后组织一个阅读会，识字的教不识字的读书。不，朝鲜人民没有被人打败。只有李奇微他们这些杀人犯才遭受到可耻的失败。
    他们的名誉扫地。他们是孤单的。“联合国”的旗帜不过是一个虚设的幌子。三四个国家的一小撮雇佣兵并不能构成一个世界各国的联合。然而当我们接触到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的心脏时，便感觉到全世界人民活跃的心脏在跳动。中国人民志愿军的战士们，好像运动家一般，活跃轻快，和他们的朝鲜兄弟并肩作战。我们对他们的勇敢和纪律不禁钦佩。他们作为一个军队所给人的印象，的确是一个同一的意志，有作战经验，精干而且有效率的军队。我想，在一七九二年法国大革命时的志愿军和这个军队必定有很多共同的特点。
    我又回想到在平壤附近的一个傍晚。我们几个朋友在隐藏在树林里的一个指挥部里。其中有一位年青的中国志愿军，原来是文科学生。有一位是匈牙利医生，他在一个匈牙利人民献给朝鲜的战地医院里工作。另有六位朝鲜军官和兵士。又有一位苏联记者、一位波兰外科医生，他是一个整容外科医生，日日夜夜在设法使被汽油弹所损坏了面貌的人们的眼皮重新合上。此外又有一位中国的细菌学专家，他和他的朝鲜兄弟们共同为了扑灭美国人撒下的灾祸而斗争。还有一位年青的罗马尼亚外交官和我自己，一个法国作家。
    我们谈论战争，战争的残暴事实和未来。我们中间有一个人低声唱国际歌的调子。所有人都随着他的声音唱起来。朝鲜人用朝鲜文唱，中国人用中文唱，匈牙利人用匈牙利文唱，苏联人用俄文唱，罗马尼亚人和波兰人都用他们本国文字唱，我用法文唱。发出字音全都不同，然而调子和意义都是同一的。
    我听到了广大群众高唱“国际歌”。在任何时候我从来没有比这次更受到感动。平壤的国际歌，所有各处的人们低声唱着这个希望的歌曲，在破坏的残迹当中……
