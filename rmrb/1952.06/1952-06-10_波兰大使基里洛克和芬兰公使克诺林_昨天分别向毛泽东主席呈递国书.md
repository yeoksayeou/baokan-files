Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Administration Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Xu Yixin, Deputy Director of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Liaison Department. Ambassador Kiryluk delivered a eulogy to Chairman Mao Zedong upon presenting his credentials, to which Chairman Mao Zedong replied.

    Ambassador Kiryluk's Eulogy:
    Mr. Chairman,

    I am honored to present to Your Excellency the Letter of Credence from the President of the Republic of Poland appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Poland, and at the same time to present the Letter of Recall of the former Ambassador, Mr. Burgin.

    On this solemn occasion of presenting my credentials, I would like to convey the most heartfelt and warm congratulations from the President of the Republic of Poland, Bolesław Bierut, to Your Excellency and, through Your Excellency, to the great Chinese people.

    The Polish people express their deepest admiration and respect for the heroic Chinese people. Under Your Excellency's leadership, the Chinese people have waged a long struggle to liberate themselves from the shackles of feudalism and foreign imperialism. Today, the Polish people, with the same sentiment, are watching the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people against the American aggressors. The assistance given by the People's Republic of China to Korea is a great contribution to the struggle for the cause of peace throughout the world.

    The Polish people watch with deep friendship the outstanding and comprehensive development of the People's Republic of China. The Polish people fully understand that the politically revolutionary changes and the great achievements in society, economy, and culture have made it one of the decisive countries in the Far East.

    For the first time in history, our two peoples have embarked on the path of fraternal cooperation. The increasingly consolidated political relations, the growing economic relations, shipping relations, and cultural cooperation between Poland and China are promoting the further development of our two countries and helping us to shatter the conspiracies of imperialism. The imperialists are trying to enslave free people and rule the world.

    The close ties between our two free peoples strengthen the power of the world's peaceful and progressive camp, headed by the great Soviet Union.

    Your Excellency, I assure you that I will do my best to consolidate the fraternal relations between our two peoples. I sincerely hope that in carrying out my glorious mission, I will receive the full support of Your Excellency and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

    Your Excellency, please accept my most heartfelt and sincere wishes: I wish you happiness and health, I wish the fraternal Chinese people success and happiness, and I wish the People's Republic of China prosperity.

    Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply:
    Mr. Ambassador,

    I am extremely pleased to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency from the President of the Republic of Poland and thank you for your warm congratulations.

    In the past two years, the friendly relations between China and Poland in political, economic, and cultural fields have made significant progress. The Chinese people deeply admire the moving cause of the Polish people rebuilding their motherland and moving towards socialism under the leadership of President Bierut, and sincerely rejoice in your outstanding achievements. I am deeply convinced that further close cooperation between our two peoples will not only be conducive to enhancing friendship between the two countries but also contribute to the common cause of world peace we are striving for.

    I heartily welcome Your Excellency's appointment as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Poland to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to provide you with as much assistance as possible in your work to consolidate and develop the friendship between the two peoples.

    I wish your country prosperity, your people prosperity, and your head of state good health.

At the same time, I present to you the Letter of Recall of the former Finnish Minister to China.

    I am entrusted by the President of the Republic to take this solemn occasion to convey to Your Excellency the President's high esteem for the prosperity of China and the happiness of the Chinese people, as well as his sincere wishes.

    Our government is very eager to contribute to the cause of maintaining and defending world peace, because this is a prerequisite for the Finnish people to be able to engage in friendly and beneficial cooperation with the peace-loving people of the world to continue to develop their cultural life and national economy.

    While pursuing this sincere policy of peace and friendship, our government is willing to further demonstrate the importance it attaches to maintaining and strengthening the friendly relations that already exist between the Finnish and Chinese peoples. Therefore, our government believes that it is appropriate and meaningful to send a resident envoy to Beijing as its representative to the People's Republic of China from now on.

    Personally, it is a great honor and pleasure for me to be selected to represent our country in this historically significant capital of China. I sincerely hope and firmly intend to work to enhance understanding between the two governments and to develop beneficial cooperation between the two governments, and to seek all ways to bring the Finnish and Chinese peoples closer together in the economic and cultural fields.

    I believe that Your Excellency and the Central People's Government will continue to support my efforts to achieve these goals and to fulfill my mission.

    Mr. Minister:

    I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency from the President of the Republic of Finland, and I thank Your Excellency for conveying the congratulations of Your Excellency the President on the prosperity and happiness of the Chinese people.

    The strengthening of the friendship between the Chinese people and the Finnish people, and the further development of economic and cultural relations between the two countries, would contribute to the cause of world peace which we both cherish.

    I warmly welcome Your Excellency as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Finland to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to assist Your Excellency in strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries.

    I wish your country prosperity, your people prosperity, and your head of state good health.
