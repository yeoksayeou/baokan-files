Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. State-owned and public-owned factories and mines, as well as basic construction departments in the Northeast Region, are continuing to raise their originally planned targets in formulating plans to increase production and practice economy. The planned total value has reached the equivalent of more than ten million and sixty-eight thousand tons of grain. Due to the great potential within state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, the targets of this plan are still being continuously raised. In the process of discussing national plans and formulating plans to increase production and practice economy, factories and mines in the Northeast Region have demonstrated two characteristics of this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy in the Northeast Region: First, rapid progress. Most factories and mines in various places completed the work of discussion and formulation of plans in about a month, shortening the time by one-third to one-half compared to last year. State-owned and public-owned factory and mine workers in Shenyang City had already completed the planning stage in early June and launched a production competition movement between factories, between units under factories and mines, and between individuals. State-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Harbin, Benxi, and other places have also successively formulated plans in mid-June after discussions in workshops and groups. Even in Dalian, Anshan and other cities where the campaign started relatively slowly, the plans of most state-owned factories have been drawn up. Second, most of the plans exceed the original tasks assigned by the higher authorities. According to a survey of 26 factories by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government: the planned targets for increasing production and practicing economy proposed after discussions by the leading departments of each factory were on average 28% higher than the tasks given by the various industrial administrative bureaus; after discussions by the workshops and groups of each factory, they were on average 41% higher than the tasks given by the factory headquarters. The Mechanical Industry Administration Bureau gave its affiliated factories a task of increasing production and practicing economy equivalent to 400,000 tons of grain. After layer-by-layer discussions in each factory, especially after discussions by workers in each production group, it surged to more than 940,000 tons. The Northeast Electrical Industry Administration Bureau stipulated that the task of increasing production and practicing economy for the No. 2 Electric Factory was 6,000 tons of grain. After repeated discussions by the leadership and workers of the factory six times, the final planned target was increased by more than eight times.

The reasons for the formation of these two characteristics are that the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has greatly increased the consciousness of the working masses; at the same time, the leading departments of each factory and mine have summarized and accepted the experience of increasing production and practicing economy last year, paying attention to ideological education, thereby dispelling the ideological concerns of cadres and workers, so that the vast number of workers generally recognized the importance of carrying out this movement and launched a movement to find "tricks" and learn from advanced experience.

The problem that deserves attention in the current movement is that some units did not emphasize or even neglected the issue of improving quality when discussing and formulating plans to increase production and practice economy. In order to correct this deviation, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, after piloting it, has arranged for a "re-examination of group plans and supplementary quality lessons" to be carried out in all factories, consciously combining the enthusiasm of the masses for finding "tricks" and learning from advanced experience with improving quality. The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed local party committees to learn from Shenyang's experience, conduct "quality supplementary lessons," mobilize the masses to find "tricks" to improve quality, summarize and promote advanced experience in improving quality, and integrate and supplement it into the plans for increasing production and practicing economy and technical measures plans, so as to increase products and reduce costs on the basis of improving quality.

### 东北区工业部门继续提高原订生产指标  增产节约计划总值千余万吨粮食

    东北区工业部门继续提高原订生产指标
    增产节约计划总值千余万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北区国营、公营厂矿及基本建设部门在制订增产节约计划中继续提高原订指标，计划总值已达到了一千零六十八万吨粮食的价值。由于国营工矿企业内部的潜在能力很大，现这个计划的指标仍在不断提高。东北区各厂矿在讨论国家计划和制订增产节约计划的过程中，显示出东北区今年开展增产节约运动的两个特点：一、进展迅速。各地厂、矿大部在一个月左右的时间内完成了讨论和制订计划的工作，时间比去年缩短了三分之一到二分之一。沈阳市国营、公营各厂矿职工在六月上旬就已结束了制订计划的阶段，展开了工厂间、厂矿所属单位间与个人间的生产竞赛运动；哈尔滨、本溪等地国营、公营厂矿经过车间、小组讨论，也已在六月中旬相继订出了计划；连运动开展得比较迟缓的大连、鞍山等市，绝大部分国营工厂的计划，也已订出。二、计划大都超过上级原规定的任务。据东北人民政府工业部在二十六个工厂中的调查：经过各厂领导部门讨论后提出的增产节约计划指标，比各工业管理局所给任务平均提高了百分之二十八；经过各厂的车间、小组讨论后，又比各厂厂部所给任务平均提高了百分之四十一。机械工业管理局给予所属各厂的增产节约任务是四十万吨粮食，经过各厂层层讨论，尤其是经各生产小组的工人讨论后，就激增至九十四万余吨。东北电器工业管理局规定电工二厂的增产节约任务是六千吨粮食，经过该厂领导方面和工人反复讨论了六次，最后订出的计划指标增加到八倍以上。
    形成这两个特点的原因，是由于“三反”“五反”运动的胜利大大地提高了工人群众觉悟；同时也由于各厂矿领导方面总结和接受了去年增产节约的经验，注意了思想教育工作，从而解除了干部和职工中的思想顾虑，使广大职工普遍认识了开展这一运动的重要意义，展开了找“窍门”和学习先进经验的运动。
    目前运动值得注意的问题是：某些单位在讨论和制订增产节约计划时，没有强调甚至或忽视了提高质量的问题。中共沈阳市委员会为了纠正这一偏向，经过试点后，已布置在各厂普遍进行一次“复查小组计划，进行质量补课”的工作，有意识地把群众找“窍门”、学习先进经验的热情和改进质量结合起来。中共中央东北局已指示各地党委学习沈阳的经验，进行“质量补课”，发动群众找改善质量的“窍门”，总结和推广改进质量的先进经验，把它综合和补充到增产节约计划及技术措施计划中去，以便做到在提高质量的基础上，增加产品和降低成本。
