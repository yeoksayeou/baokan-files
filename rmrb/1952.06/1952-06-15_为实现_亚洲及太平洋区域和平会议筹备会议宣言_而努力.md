Strive to Realize the "Declaration of the Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference"
Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

The Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was convened on June 3rd and successfully concluded on the 6th. During the meeting, forty-seven representatives from twenty countries reported on the progress of the peace cause in their respective countries; representatives from several countries directly subjected to aggression further described the tragic disasters brought to their people by the imperialist policies of aggression. Over the four-day session, the representatives frankly and thoroughly exchanged opinions, discussed issues, and finally, in a solemn and harmonious atmosphere, adopted the declaration of the preparatory meeting and proposals regarding the various preparatory works for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, laying a solid foundation for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing in the near future.

The process of this meeting proves that, despite the differences in race, belief, occupation, and political views among peace-loving people, they are fully capable of uniting in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

In the declaration of the meeting, it was clearly pointed out that to achieve lasting peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, the following things must be done:

(1) Achieve an armistice in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis; the American aggressors must stop employing those delaying tactics and self-deceiving tricks in the armistice negotiations, and stop using inhumane bacteriological weapons and the crimes of massacring prisoners of war. (2) The Japanese people must obtain genuine independence and enter into a peaceful life. The illegal Treaty of Peace with Japan and military agreements, etc., concocted single-handedly by US imperialism, aim to turn Japan into their naval, land, and air force base, to revive Japanese militarism, and to turn the Japanese people into their cannon fodder. The Japanese people have already launched, and are launching, a movement against the illegal treaty and demanding the withdrawal of foreign occupation troops. This movement of the Japanese people must be supported so that their struggle goals can be victoriously realized in order to guarantee lasting peace in the Far East and the Pacific region. (3) The sovereignty and territory of all countries in the entire Asian and Pacific regions must no longer be threatened and harmed by aggressive military alliances. The national independence and basic rights of all oppressed peoples—such as the people of Vietnam and Malaya—must be guaranteed. The acts of imperialists who plunder the economic resources of colonial and semi-colonial countries by all kinds of high-handed means and use them to advance war preparations must be stopped. (4) On the above basis, expand international trade, promote cultural exchanges, abolish all "embargoes," "blockades," and various artificial obstacles such as economic discrimination, and affirm that countries with different political and social systems can coexist peacefully and treat each other equally.

The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will warmly respond to these calls and promote their realization with actions.

The objective conditions for the victory of the peace forces in the Asian and Pacific regions exist. The overwhelming majority of people love peace, and only an absolute minority clamor for war. The peace movement of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions is unfolding. From the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal, from the signature campaign for the declaration calling for a Five-Power Peace Pact, from the response to the initiation and preparation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions—including the peace-loving people of the United States and Japan—have demonstrated great unity. And the convening and successful conclusion of this Preparatory Meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference further symbolizes that the unity of the people in this region has taken a big step forward. Based on this unity, and with further efforts to make the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions more extensive and stronger, it will surely be able to overcome the threat of war.

In order to successfully convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing in the near future, so as to further enhance and strengthen the peace movement in this region, the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions must use all means to further win over and absorb more groups and individuals from all social strata in various countries to participate in the work of defending peace in this region. It is necessary to adopt various effective methods to give confidence to those who doubt, strengthen those who waver, and make the peace movement more and more effectively influence the domestic political life of various countries in this region, and link this struggle for peace with the struggle for national independence and to save the economic crisis.

On this point, the Chinese people are willing to work together with the peace-loving people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions!

    为实现“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言”而努力
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席  陈叔通
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议已于六月三日召开，六日胜利闭幕。会议期间，来自二十个国家的四十七位代表报告了本国和平事业的进展；若干直接受到侵略的各国代表更叙述了帝国主义侵略政策所带给他们的人民的惨痛灾祸。在四天会期中，代表们坦白地、详尽地交换了意见，讨论了问题，最后在严肃而融洽的空气中通过了筹备会议宣言和关于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议各项筹备工作的提议，为预定在不久的将来在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议奠定了巩固的基础。
    这次会议的经过证明：尽管在爱好和平人民中间有着种族、信仰、职业、政见的种种不同，但在保卫远东以及世界和平的斗争中却是完全能够团结一致的。
    在会议的宣言中，清楚地指出了要获致亚洲及太平洋区域的持久和平，必须做到这样几件事情：
    （一）在公平合理的基础上促成朝鲜停战；美国侵略者必须停止施展那些拖延停战谈判、自欺欺人的伎俩，并停止使用非人道的细菌武器及屠杀战俘的罪行。（二）日本人民必须得到真正独立，进入和平生活。美帝国主义一手包办的非法对日和约和军事协定等等，目的是要把日本变成他们的海陆空军根据地，是要使日本军国主义复活，是要把日本人民变成他们的炮灰。日本人民现在已经展开了、并在展开着反对非法和约、要求撤退外国占领军的运动。必须支持日本人民的这个运动，使他们的斗争目标胜利实现，才能保障远东及太平洋区域的持久和平。（三）整个亚洲及太平洋区域所有国家的主权与领土不再受到侵略性军事同盟的威胁与危害。一切被压迫民族——例如越南和马来亚——人民的民族独立及基本权利必须得到保障。帝国主义者用种种横行霸道的手段来掠夺殖民地半殖民地国家的经济资源并用以推进战争准备的行为必须停止。（四）在上述基础之上，扩展国际贸易，增进文化交流，废止一切“禁运”、“封锁”及经济歧视等各种人为阻碍，肯定一切政治社会制度不同的国家可以和平共处，平等相待。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民，将热烈响应这些号召，并以行动促其实现。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国和平力量取得胜利的客观条件是存在着的。爱好和平的人民占绝大多数，叫嚣战争的人只占绝对少数。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的和平运动正在开展。从斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动上，从要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言签名运动上，从响应亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起与筹备上，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民——包括美国和日本的爱好和平的人民在内——已经表现出伟大的团结。而这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的召开及胜利闭幕，更象征着这一地区人民的团结又进了一大步。以这个团结为基础，再作更进一步的努力，使亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动能够更加广泛坚强起来，那就一定能战胜战争的威胁。
    为了开好预定在不久的将来即在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，以便把这一区域的和平运动更加提高并加强一步，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民必须用一切办法来进一步争取和吸收各国社会各阶层更多的团体和个人来参加保卫本区域的和平的工作。要采取各种有效的办法，使怀疑者产生信心，使动摇者坚定起来，使和平运动能越来越有效地影响本区域各国的国内政治生活，并把这种争取和平的斗争与争取民族独立、挽救经济危机的斗争联系起来。
    在这一点上，中国人民愿和亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的人民在一起共同努力！
