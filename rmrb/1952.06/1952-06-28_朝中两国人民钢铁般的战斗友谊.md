　　My five-month visit to China has made me more clearly aware of the revolutionary historical tradition of the fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China; this fighting friendship has grown and consolidated in the struggle against American imperialist aggression.

　　When I visited Nanjing, a 65-year-old man, Uncle Wen Linju, affectionately hugged me and said, "When I see you, I feel as happy as if I saw my son on the Korean front." He also said, "I believe my son is bravely fighting the American aggressors." He stroked my head and hands with his warm hands, and tears of joy ran down his wrinkled face. This care and concern moved me so much that I couldn't speak. I only said one sentence to comfort him: "Uncle, please rest assured, we are all well at the front."

　　We received care and concern from the Chinese people everywhere. When the Chinese people heard my report on the atrocities of the American imperialists on the territory of our motherland, they angrily raised their fists and shouted: "Avenge the Korean people and Korean children, and completely eliminate the American imperialist aggressors!" After listening to our report, a woman named Ma from Zhenjiang cried for two days. Her daughter asked her why she was crying, and she said: "The suffering of the Korean people is our suffering! You go to the Korean front immediately to avenge the people, and I will do everything in my power to support you from the rear."

　　The people of Korea and China have a solid and long-lasting fighting friendship. As early as the War of Resistance Against Japan, our respected leader, General Kim Il-sung, led many outstanding Korean sons and daughters together with the Chinese people in a heroic struggle against the evil Japanese imperialists. When I visited the Harbin Martyrs' Memorial Hall, I saw many photos of Korean martyrs on display there, and their heroic deeds were recorded. These heroic deeds have been universally praised by the Chinese people. Today, in order to help liberate the Korean people and to defend peace in the East and the world, the Chinese people have organized a strong volunteer army to fight bravely alongside the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors. The Chinese people's noble internationalist morality and the heroic and tenacious fighting style of the Chinese People's Volunteers have been praised by the Korean people and the people of the world. The Korean people warmly love the Chinese People's Volunteers and regard them as their own relatives. Korean women draw their own blood from their arms as much as possible to transfuse to wounded volunteers, so that they can quickly recover their health. The friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China have been further consolidated in the just struggle against American imperialist aggression. The blood-linked fighting friendship and unbreakable unity between the two peoples will inevitably lead to the complete failure of any military adventure by American imperialism.

　　During my visit to China, I was warmly welcomed by my Chinese brothers and sisters. Everywhere I saw them working and laboring intensely under the slogan of "Increase production and practice thrift, resist America and aid Korea." The great strength of the 475 million Chinese people, united under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, is actively assisting our struggle. This great action inspires our fighting will. In order to defend the motherland and world peace, and for the happiness and safety of the people of Korea and China, I will fire more shells and bullets at the American aggressors.

    朝中两国人民钢铁般的战斗友谊
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国海军战斗英雄  康波
    我这次在中国经过了五个月的访问，使我更清楚地认识了朝中两国人民的具有革命历史传统的战斗友谊；这种战斗友谊，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中更日益成长巩固。
    我在南京访问时，六十五岁的温林巨老大爷亲切地抱着我说：“我见了你，就好像看到了我在朝鲜前线的儿子一样高兴。”他并且说：“我相信我的儿子一定正在勇敢地打击美国侵略者。”他用温暖的手抚摸我的头和手，在他满是皱纹的脸上，高兴得流下了眼泪。这种爱护和关怀，使我感动得说不出话来，我只说了这样一句话来安慰他：“老大爷，请你放心吧，我们在前线都很好。”
    我们到处受到中国人民的爱护和关怀。当中国人民听到了我报告美帝国主义者在我们祖国疆土上的暴行后，都愤怒地举起拳头喊道：“为朝鲜人民和朝鲜儿童报仇，彻底消灭美帝国主义侵略者！”镇江的一位马大娘听了我们的报告以后，哭了两天。她的女儿问她为什么哭，她说：“朝鲜人民的痛苦就是咱们的痛苦啊！你马上到朝鲜前线去替人民报仇，我在后方会尽一切力量支援你。”
    朝中两国人民有着牢固的和长久的战斗友谊。早在抗日战争时期，我们敬爱的领袖金日成将军就领导着许多优秀的朝鲜儿女和中国人民在一起，为反对万恶的日本帝国主义进行英勇的斗争。我在参观哈尔滨烈士馆的时候，看到那里陈列着许多朝鲜烈士的照片，并且记载着他们的英雄事迹。这些英雄事迹受到中国人民的普遍赞颂。今天，中国人民为了帮助朝鲜人民的解放，为了保卫东方和全世界的和平，又组织了坚强的志愿军，和朝鲜人民军并肩向美国侵略者进行英勇的战斗。中国人民高尚的国际主义道德和中国人民志愿军的英勇顽强的战斗作风，受到了朝鲜人民和世界人民的赞扬。朝鲜人民热烈爱戴中国人民志愿军，把他们视同自己的亲人一样。朝鲜妇女们尽可能地把自己的血从胳膊上抽出来输给志愿军伤员，使他们迅速恢复健康。朝中两国人民的友谊和团结，在反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争中更加巩固起来了。两国人民血肉相连的战斗友谊和牢不可破的团结，必然会使美帝国主义的任何军事冒险遭到彻底的失败。
    我在访问中国期间，受到中国兄弟姊妹们的热烈欢迎。到处看到他们在“增产节约抗美援朝”的口号下紧张地工作和劳动着。伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下的四亿七千五百万中国人民团结一致的强大力量，正在积极援助我们的斗争。这伟大的行动鼓舞着我们的战斗意志。为了保卫祖国和世界和平，为了朝鲜和中国人民的幸福和安全，我要向美国侵略者发射更多的炮弹和子弹。
