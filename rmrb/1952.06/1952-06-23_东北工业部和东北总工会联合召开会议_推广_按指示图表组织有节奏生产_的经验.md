The Northeast Industrial Department and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions jointly convened the Advanced Experience Promotion Conference on "Organizing Rhythmic Production According to Instruction Charts," which concluded on the 12th.

The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government attached great importance to this conference. Chairman Gao Gang and Vice Chairman Lin Feng both attended the conference and gave important instructions. Soviet experts also gave special reports on how to organize rhythmic production according to instruction charts at the conference. The representatives listened to the experience of the workers of the Third Machinery Factory in learning to organize rhythmic production according to instruction charts, and visited the factory's exhibition of "Organizing Rhythmic Production According to Instruction Charts."

After four days of study, the representatives unanimously affirmed the great significance of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts. The representatives unanimously recognized that organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts can strengthen the planning and organization of production management, and it specifically embodies the superiority of socialist production management methods. This advanced experience is a major reform in production management. Learning this advanced experience can better promote various advanced technical experiences, give full play to the role of various advanced technologies, and regulate the imbalance in the production process. The chaotic situation in production management in the past, such as periods of slack and tension, work stoppages waiting for materials, overtime work, restrictions on advanced technical experience, and failure to improve product quality, can be changed from now on.

Zhang Youxuan, Director of the Mechanical Industry Administration Bureau, in his speech, in light of the experience of the mechanical industry system in learning this advanced experience, criticized the following conservative ideas: such as thinking that the product is complex, new products are constantly increasing, so there are no conditions to learn; or thinking that achieving balanced production according to instruction charts can solve all problems, while ignoring the importance of doing a good job in a series of organizational work, constantly discovering new imbalances, and solving new imbalances to continuously improve production capacity, etc.

This advanced experience is not only suitable for the mechanical industry, but also suitable for all industrial sectors. Over the past three years, all state-owned and public-private joint ventures in the Northeast have similarly shifted from restoring production to normal production, similarly undergone mass movements in various periods, and similarly accumulated experience in production management, possessing the same learning conditions. More importantly, organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts is an important reform in production management methods, which is not only possible, but also necessary to promote in all production enterprises.

The representatives clearly recognized the necessity and possibility of vigorously promoting this advanced experience. The Dalian-Lushun delegation, the Songjiang Province delegation, the railway system delegation, the electrical industry delegation, and the Shenyang mechanical industry delegation all expressed their determination and confidence in promoting this advanced experience. Some factories, such as the Fifth Electrical Factory and the Fifth Machinery Factory, have already formulated specific learning plans.

On the morning of the 12th, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally attended the meeting and rewarded the Third Machinery Factory, which achieved great success in learning to organize rhythmic production according to instruction charts, the Eighteenth Machinery Factory, which implemented the advanced experience of "Expanding Professional Planning," the small motor workshop of the Fifth Electrical Factory, which implemented the advanced experience of "Labor Division of Labor Specialization," the Second Workshop of the First Machinery Factory, which created the advanced experience of "Joint Groups," and the Liu Lifu forging group of a certain factory in Dalian-Lushun, as well as the workers of the First Farm Implement Factory, such as Yang Shoukun, the founder of the "Double Symmetrical Molding Method" and the "Sand Casting Assembly Line Method."

### 东北工业部和东北总工会联合召开会议  推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的经验

    东北工业部和东北总工会联合召开会议
    推广“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的经验
    东北人民政府工业部、东北总工会联合召开的
    “按指示图表组织有节奏生产”先进经验推广大会，已于十二日闭幕。
    中共中央东北局、东北人民政府对这次大会极为重视，高岗主席、林枫副主席都亲临大会作了重要指示。苏联专家也在会上作了如何按指示图表组织有节奏生产的专题报告。到会代表听取了机械三厂职工学习按指示图表组织有节奏生产的经验，并参观了该厂“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的展览会。
    到会代表经过四天学习，一致肯定了按指示图表组织有节奏生产的重大意义。代表们一致认识到按指示图表组织有节奏生产，可以加强生产管理的计划性和组织性，它具体地体现了社会主义生产管理方法的优越性。这一先进经验是生产管理上的重大改革，学习这一先进经验，可以更好地推广各种先进技术经验，充分发挥各种先进技术的作用，调节生产过程中的不平衡现象。过去生产中忽松忽紧，停工待料，加班加点，束缚先进技术经验，产品质量不能提高等生产管理上的混乱局面，从此可以改变了。
    机械工业管理局张有萱局长在发言中，就机械工业系统学习这一先进经验的体会，批判了下列各种保守思想：如认为产品复杂、新产品不断增加，因此没有条件学习；或认为按照指示图表达到均衡生产，就可以解决一切问题，而忽视了必须做好一系列组织工作，不断发现新的不均衡现象，解决新的不均衡现象，以不断提高生产能力的重要性等等。
    这一先进经验不但适合于机械工业，而且适合于
    一切工业部门。三年来，东北所有国公营工厂同样由恢复生产转入正常生产，同样经过各个时期的群众运动，同样积累了生产管理上的经验，具备着相同的学习条件。更重要的是，按指示图表组织有节奏生产是一个生产管理方法上的重要改革，不但可能，而且必须在一切生产企业推广。
    到会代表清楚地认识到大力推广这一先进经验的必要性和可能性。旅大地区代表团，松江省代表团，铁路系统代表团，电器工业代表团，沈阳机械工业代表团都表示有决心和信心推广这一先进经验。有的工厂，如电工五厂、机械五厂，已拟定了具体学习计划。
    十二日午前，东北人民政府林枫副主席亲自到会，奖励了学习按指示图表组织有节奏生产获得巨大成绩的机械三厂、实行“扩大专业计划”先进经验的机械十八厂、实行“劳动分工专业化”先进经验的电工五厂小型电机车间、创造“联合小组”先进经验的机械一厂第二车间、旅大某工厂的刘立富锻工小组等五单位，以及“双称造型法”“翻砂流水作业法”创始人农具一厂的工人杨守训等。
