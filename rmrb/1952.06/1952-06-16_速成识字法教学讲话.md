Seventh Lecture: Consolidating and Improving the Teaching Results of the Quick Literacy Method (Part 1)

In previous lectures, we have finished explaining the characteristics and teaching steps of the Quick Literacy Method. Today, we will talk about how to consolidate and improve the teaching results of the Quick Literacy Method. We plan to cover this issue in two parts. Now, let's first talk about: the need to correctly understand the Quick Literacy Method teaching.

First, after repeated experiments in various places, it has been proven that the Quick Literacy Method is a good method for eliminating illiteracy. It is not only suitable for cadres who are off-duty, but also for cadres who are on-duty; it is not only suitable for government offices and companies, but also for the broad masses of workers and peasants; it is not only suitable for students from northern China, but also for students from other regions. Therefore, it is not only welcomed and supported by the broad masses of commanders and fighters in the military, but also warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses of workers and peasants throughout the country. All companies and spare-time schools that use this method have achieved good results in literacy education. For example, the Fourth Field Army basically eliminated illiteracy in less than two months. Another example is Comrade Lü Hai, a soldier in the guard battalion of the North China Military Region, who had never attended school since he was a child. Since the company implemented the Quick Literacy Method teaching last December, after a month of study, he can now read the fourth volume of the national language textbook for the military. He said: "The facts have told me that the Quick Literacy Method is indeed a good way to eliminate illiteracy. Today, I have reached the equivalent of elementary school graduation in language, and I am extremely happy. I will continue to work hard and fight to the end for the construction of a modern national defense army and the defense of the motherland!" Such examples are not isolated, and we can find many in the army, factories, and rural areas. The facts prove the superiority of the Quick Literacy Method, and we should not have the slightest doubt about it. As Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, Lu Dingyi, said at the award ceremony held by the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council for Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Quick Literacy Method," Comrade Qi Jianhua's creation of the "Quick Literacy Method" is an innovation in education work. It has opened a door for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to master cultural knowledge and has a great effect on the rapid improvement of the cultural level of our people.

It has been more than two years since Comrade Qi Jianhua created the Quick Literacy Method and the military began to vigorously promote it. Since last November, it has been further clearly stated that promoting the Quick Literacy Method is a major task in the current cultural education construction work of the military; much experience has also been accumulated in teaching implementation, textbooks, and educational tools. Today, we can say that as long as we combine the specific circumstances of each unit and apply and master these experiences, we can continuously achieve victory in teaching.

Second, the entire teaching process of the Quick Literacy Method is a blitz, but reading, writing, and "writing stories" should take up a relatively long time. After learning the new characters, it is necessary to repeatedly tell the students: do not take improving your education too lightly or simply. If you learn the new characters and then abandon them, you will forget them quickly. You must read and write more, persistently and for a long time. Learning to recognize characters is relatively easy, but achieving the "four abilities" – to read, write, speak, and apply – is relatively difficult. Therefore, after achieving literacy, you must continue to study harder and never be satisfied or stop making progress.

Currently, in some units, there is a tendency to pursue "quick literacy," as if the faster the better the results. This understanding is incorrect and must be corrected in time. On the one hand, we should advocate the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and when promoting the Quick Literacy Method, we should try our best to take care of the vast majority of students and move forward steadily. On the other hand (which is also the main aspect), we should pay attention to studying methods to consolidate learning achievements, and not only focus on blitz, using the number of characters recognized to measure achievements, without asking about the degree of consolidation. After a large amount of blitz literacy, conducting considerable reading, writing, and "writing stories" activities is an essential teaching task.

Third, although the Quick Literacy Method teaching is a good way to eliminate illiteracy, it is not the entirety of the military's cultural education work. Cultural and scientific knowledge is very broad. For a person who has just learned to recognize characters, it is like just stepping into the "gate" of culture. They must continue to put in more effort to acquire cultural and scientific knowledge. At present, although we have learned to recognize characters, this is only the first step forward. Recognizing more than two thousand characters only lays the foundation for further improving reading and writing skills in the future, and creates basic conditions for learning arithmetic, common sense of natural science, history, and geography. Therefore, we cannot think that "learning more than two thousand characters is enough to be a college student." This kind of complacency will affect the progress of learning. After blitzing new characters, we must continue to consolidate and improve the teaching results of the Quick Literacy Method, prepare to connect it with the language teaching and other courses teaching in the next stage, and move forward steadily, in order to improve the cultural level of the military and build a regular and modern national defense force!

Eighth Lecture: Consolidating and Improving the Teaching Results of the Quick Literacy Method (Part 2)

The Quick Literacy Method teaching is a mass teaching activity, so it is extremely intensive. If the teachers lack a mass perspective in their thinking, do not adopt a serious, conscientious, and responsible work attitude, and do not carry out teaching with a resolute and tenacious spirit, they will often produce "dead corners" and the phenomenon of some students "falling behind" will occur.

According to the experience of the Southwest Military Region and the Central South Military Region, the number of "dropouts" in some learning units exceeds five percent. Therefore, it is very important to carefully study and analyze the causes of the "dropout" and resolutely overcome this phenomenon. The reasons for the occurrence of "dropout" are:

First, due to insufficient understanding of the "Quick Literacy Method," it is believed that phonetic symbols are awkward, difficult to learn, useless, cannot be remembered, and it is okay not to learn them. They do not understand the essentials of pinyin, cannot do three-part spelling, some know a part, and some do not even know two-part spelling. If they did not learn the previous step well, they fell behind in the next step.

Second, due to many official duties and other tasks, they did not attend every class and did not make good use of make-up lessons.

Third, due to blindly pursuing the number of characters recognized, only seeking speed but not results; or taking the acceptance ability of a few people as the standard for blitz literacy, the classes are not organized strictly or scientifically.

Fourth, due to some ideological problems among the students not being well resolved, their spirits are not concentrated; or because the mutual aid group work is not done well, they do not care about each other; or because their learning confidence is not strong, they have fallen behind.

Fifth, in a very few cases, it is due to physiological reasons, such as being too old, physically weak, having poor memory, and at the same time not having developed the habit of learning.

Based on the above, we can see that, except for a very small number and individual comrades whose learning performance is poor due to physiological reasons and must be given strengthened leadership and assistance, the average comrade can catch up with the progress. In order to avoid the occurrence of the "dropout" phenomenon, we must pay attention to:

First, the mobilization work should strive to be thorough so that the energy of each student is always focused on teaching activities. We should not be satisfied with the temporary and superficial learning enthusiasm of ordinary students. We should continue to repeatedly mobilize, collect students' opinions in a timely manner, understand their thinking and learning situations, and mobilize again in response to some major ideological problems. We should also patiently conduct individual talks with individual comrades, so that each comrade has a high degree of confidence in the Quick Literacy Method from beginning to end and is determined to learn it well.

Second, teachers should pay special attention to pinyin teaching. If the students' pinyin ability has not reached a certain level of proficiency, they should not rashly blitz new characters. Because in the Quick Literacy Method teaching, pinyin is a "major hurdle." Whether the pinyin "hurdle" is passed well will directly affect the effectiveness of blitz literacy. Therefore, teachers must master this point well. When the majority have passed the pinyin "hurdle," they can blitz new characters; those who have not passed the "hurdle" should be given strengthened individual guidance by tutoring teachers, and fully utilize the role of mutual assistance so that they can quickly keep up.

Third, the work of class scheduling should be done well before starting to blitz literacy. Literacy class scheduling should take into account the students' original level, and those with similar levels should be put into the same class to facilitate grasping the teaching progress. According to the teaching experience of the Southwest Military Region and the Central South Military Region, each company can be divided into four classes: illiterate students and those who know 200 characters are assigned to the first class; those who know 200 to 500 characters are assigned to the second class; those who know 500 to 1,000 characters are assigned to the third class; and those who know more than 1,000 characters are assigned to the fourth class. The advantage of this class scheduling method is that the students' acceptance ability is roughly similar, and the progress is easy to be consistent.

Fourth, strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid group work, and constantly conduct unity and mutual assistance education; understand the situation in a timely manner, promote the advantages, and correct bad tendencies. The work of the mutual aid group is mainly focused on helping comrades who are making slow progress, so that they can steadily improve with the help and encouragement of the masses, but avoid impatience and discouraging them. Those who lack learning confidence should be given more comfort and encouragement, and even care for their daily lives. Therefore, teachers must teach patiently and meticulously and should not adopt simplified working methods. If there are difficulties or problems, they must rely on the Party and Youth League organizations to seek solutions.

Fifth, organize more comrades who are good at learning to give reports to everyone, hold more forums, introduce learning experiences to solve the difficulties in learning methods, and eliminate the inferiority complex of some students who are afraid of not learning well.

Here is an example: Guo Chao, deputy political commissar of a certain unit of the Central South Military Region, in order to thoroughly clarify the reasons why some comrades "fell behind" in their studies, made a detailed inspection of the team on December 30th of last year and personally taught two comrades, learning that these comrades were not "stupid" and were fully capable of catching up with the progress. For example, Wang Changlin and Dong Xicheng were the two comrades considered to be the most "stupid" by everyone, and they themselves also thought they were "stupid." But after Deputy Political Commissar Guo's explanation and encouragement, they overcame their impatience, dispelled their ideological concerns, and improved their learning confidence. Then, they used the literacy "three-step method" (the first step is pinyin, the second step is literacy, and the third step is explanation. Emphasize remembering the appearance of the characters) for teaching, reviewing as they lectured. As a result, they taught ten characters in half an hour, and they were able to remember them completely. Comrade Wang Changlin said, "I can remember it if you teach it this way." The results of the examination one week later showed that the two of them not only remembered the ten characters, but also completely finished reading the first volume of the national language (Deputy Political Commissar Guo only read to the fifteenth lesson when teaching them). Out of 419 new characters, only 126 new characters could not "move". This example shows that it is wrong to attribute the reason why some comrades cannot keep up with the teaching progress to "stupidity." Emphasizing that the students are "stupid," not trying to understand their difficulties and pain of not knowing characters, and even liking "smart" people and disliking "stupid" people, is a manifestation of lacking class perspective and mass perspective. If we have this kind of wrong thinking, we will inevitably fail to grasp the teaching work and actively think of ways to help the comrades who have "fallen behind." After discovering the phenomenon of "falling behind," we should carefully check the reasons for the "falling behind," whether the students have insufficient understanding and confidence in the Quick Literacy Method in their thinking, whether they have learned phonetic symbols, whether they can use them, and whether the teaching method is correct. After the situation is well understood, then think of ways to teach them well.

In short, on the issue of "falling behind," we should adopt a proactive prevention policy. As long as we are good at prevention, the phenomenon of "falling behind" can be reduced or avoided. Now, the Central South Military Region has taken effective measures for the students who have "fallen behind," or they are gathered together for teaching in units of regiments; at the same time, the best teachers are also assigned. Or, in the company, students are exempted from official duties and given sufficient study time. Except for individual students with real physiological defects, the average comrade can generally catch up with the progress of the original class by the time the textbook teaching begins.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第七讲  巩固和提高速成识字法的教学成果（上）
    前几次，我们已经把速成识字法的特点和教学步骤讲完了。今天，我们来讲一讲，怎样巩固和提高速成识字法教学的成果。这一个问题，我们准备分两次讲完，现在先讲：必须正确地认识速成识字法教学。
    第一，经过各地的反复实验，证明了速成识字法是扫除文盲的好方法。它不仅适用于离职干部，也适用于在职干部；它不仅适用于机关，适用于连队，也适用于广大的工人和农民；它不仅适用于北方籍的学员，也适用于其他地区的学员。因此，它不仅受到部队广大指战员的欢迎和拥护，同样也受到全国工、农广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。凡是运用这个方法的连队、业余学校，在识字教育工作上都取得了良好的成绩。譬如第四野战军，在不到两个月的时间内，基本上扫除了文盲。又如华北军区警卫营战士吕海同志，从小就没有念过书，自从去年十二月连里进行了速成识字法教学以后，经过一个月的学习，就能看部队第四册国语课本了。他说：“事实告诉了我，速成识字法确实是扫除文盲的好办法，我今天在语文方面达到了相当于初小毕业的程度，我真高兴极了。我要继续努力学习，为建设现代化的国防军、保卫祖国而奋斗到底！”像这样的例子，并不是个别的，我们可以在军队、工厂和农村中发现很多。事实证明了速成识字法的优越性，不容许我们对它再有丝毫的怀疑。正如中共中央宣传部陆定一部长在政务院文化教育委员会奖励“速成识字法”的创造者祁建华大会上所说，祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”是教育工作中的一个革新，它已为广大工农兵劳动人民掌握文化知识这件事打开了一道关门，对我国人民文化水平的迅速提高有很大作用。
    从祁建华同志创造速成识字法和部队开始大力推广速成识字法以来，已经两年多了。去年十一月以后，更进一步明确地提出：推广速成识字法是当前部队文化教育建设工作中的一项重大任务；在教学实施以及教材、教育工具方面也积累了许多经验。今天我们可以说：只要结合各单位的具体情况，运用和掌握这些经验，就可以在教学上不断地取得胜利。
    第二，速成识字法的整个教学过程，都是突击的，但是阅读写字和“写话”应当占用比较长的时间。在学会了生字以后，必须再三告诉学员同志们：不要把提高文化看得太轻易太简单了，如果学会了生字，就丢开了，那是很快就会忘记的，必须持久地长期地多读、多写。学会认字是比较容易的，而要达到四会——会读、会写、会讲、会用，是比较难的。因此，在识字以后，要更加努力地继续学习，决不能满足，停止不前。
    目前，在若干单位中，存在着一种追求“识字速成”的倾向，似乎越快成绩就越大。这种认识是不对的，必须及时纠正。我们一方面应当提倡实事求是的精神，在推行速成识字法的时候，应当尽量照顾最大多数学员，稳步地前进。另一方面（也是主要的），应当注意研究巩固学习成绩的方法、不要只顾突击，以数字的多少来衡量成绩，不问巩固的程度。在大量突击识字之后，进行相当的阅读、写字、写话活动，是必不可少的教学工作。
    第三，速成识字法教学，虽然是扫除文盲的好办法，但它不是部队文化教育工作的全部。文化科学知识是非常广泛的。对于一个刚学会了认字的人来说，就好比是刚刚踏进了文化的“大门”，必须继续付出更大的力量，才能获得文化科学知识。目前，我们虽然学会了认字，但这仅仅是向前迈进的第一步。认会两千多字，只是给今后进一步提高阅读和写作能力打下了基础，给学习算术、自然科学常识、历史、地理创造了基本条件。所以，不能认为“学会两千多字就是大学生了”，就“够了”。这种自满自足的态度，是会影响学习的进步的。在突击学习生字以后，必须继续巩固和提高速成识字法教学的成果，准备把它和后一阶段的语文教学和其他课程的教学衔接起来，稳步前进，为提高部队的文化水平，建设正规化现代化的国防军而努力！
    第八讲  巩固和提高速成识字法
     的教学成果（下）
    速成识字法教学，是群众性的教学活动，因此极为紧张。如果教员在思想上缺乏群众观点，不采取严肃、认真、负责的工作态度，不以坚决、顽强的精神去进行教学，往往会产生“死角”，发生某些学员“掉队”的现象。
    根据西南军区和中南军区的经验，某些学习单位的“掉队”人数超过了百分之五，因之仔细研究和分析“掉队”的原因，坚决地把这种现象加以克服是十分重要的。发生“掉队”现象的原因是：
    第一，由于对“速成识字法”认识不足，认为注音符号蹩扭、难学，没啥用，记不住，不学也行。不懂得拼音要领，不会三拼音，有的会一部分，有的连二拼音也不会。前一步没学好，便在下一步掉了队。
    第二，由于公差勤务多，或其他任务的影响，没有做到每次都参加课堂学习，又没有很好地进行补课。
    第三，由于盲目地追求识字的数字，只求速度不求成绩；或以少数人的接受能力为突击识字的标准，班次组织得不严密、不科学。
    第四，由于学员中某些思想问题没有很好地得到解决，精神不集中；或因互助组工作没有搞好，彼此互不关心；或因学习信心不强而掉了队。
    第五，极个别的是由于生理关系，如年龄太大，体力不强，记忆力太差，同时又没有养成学习的习惯。
    据上所述，我们可以看出，除了极少数和个别的同志因生理关系，学习成绩较差，必须对其加强领导辅助以外，一般同志是可以赶上进度的。为了避免“掉队”现象的发生，我们必须注意：
    第一，动员工作应力求深入，使每个学员的精力始终贯注到教学活动上去。我们不要满足于一般学员一时的表面的学习热潮，应不断地反复地进行动员，及时地收集学员的意见，了解他们的思想和学习情况，并针对某些主要的思想问题再进行动员；对个别同志还应耐心地进行个别谈话，务使每个同志自始至终对速成识字法具有高度的信心，决心学好。
    第二，教员应特别重视拼音教学，如果学员的拼音能力尚未达到一定的熟练程度，不能贸然进行突击生字。因为在速成识字法教学中拼音是个“大关口”，拼音“关”过的好坏，会直接影响到突击识字的收效。因此教员必须掌握好这一点，当大多数都过了拼音“关”的时候，才可以突击生字；少数未过“关”的，应由辅导教员加强个别指导，充分发挥互助的作用，使他们能够很快地跟上。
    第三，在开始突击识字以前要做好编班的工作。识字编班，应照顾学员的原来程度，把程度相近的编成一班，以便于掌握教学进度。根据西南军区和中南军区的教学经验，每个连队可分为四班：文盲和识二百字的学员编为第一班；识二百字到五百字的编成第二班；识五百字到一千字的编成第三班；识一千字以上的编成第四班。这种编班方式的好处是：学员的接受能力大体相仿，进度易趋一致。
    第四，加强互助组工作的领导，不断地进行团结互助教育；及时了解情况，发扬优点，纠正不良偏向。互助组的工作主要放在帮助进步慢的同志方面，使他们在群众的帮助和鼓励下稳步提高，但切忌急躁和泼冷水。对缺乏学习信心的同志，应多给予安慰和鼓励，乃至关心他们的日常生活。因此，教员必须耐心、细致地进行教学，不能采取简单化的工作方法，如有困难问题，必须依靠党和青年团组织来求得解决。
    第五，多组织学习好的同志向大家作报告，多开座谈会，介绍学习心得，以解决学习方法上的困难问题，并解除部分学员怕学不好的自卑心理。
    这里不妨举一个例子：中南军区某部郭超副政委，为了彻底弄清一部分同志学习“掉队”的原因，在去年十二月三十日到队里作了细密的检查，并亲自教了两个同志，了解到这些同志并不“笨”，是完全能够赶上进度的。例如，王长林、董西成是大家认为最“笨”的两个同志，他俩自己也认为自己“笨”，但经过郭副政委的解释与鼓励，使他们克服了急躁情绪，打消了思想顾虑，提高了学习信心。随后即用识字“三步法”（第一步是拼音，第二步是识字，第三步是讲解。强调记字的模样）进行教学，随讲随复习，结果在半小时内就教了十个字，而且他们完全能记住。王长林同志说：“这样教，我都能记住。”一星期后检查的结果，他们两人不仅记住了十个字，而且全部读完了第一册国语
    （郭副政委教他们时，只念到十五课），在四百一十九个生字里，只有一百二十六个生字不能“搬家”。这一例子说明，如果我们把某些同志跟不上教学进度的原因归之于“笨”，这是错误的。强调学员“笨”，不去体会他们不识字的困难和痛苦，甚至喜欢“聪明”人，讨厌“笨”人，是一种缺乏阶级观点和群众观点的表现。要是我们有了这种错误思想，必然不能抓紧教学工作，积极想办法帮助
    “掉队”的同志。在发现“掉队”的现象以后，应认真地检查一下“掉队”的原因何在，学员在思想上是否对速成识字法认识不足、缺乏信心，注音符号学会了没有，会用不会用，教的方法对头不对头。情况了解好之后，再想法把他们教好。
    总之，在“掉队”问题上，我们应当采取积极预防的方针。只要我们善于预防，“掉队”现象是可以减少或避免的。现在，中南军区对已“掉队”的学员采取了有效的措施，或以团为单位把他们集中起来进行教学；同时又配备了最好的教员。或在连队免除学员的公差勤务，给予足够的学习时间。除个别生理上确有缺陷者外，一般同志到课本教学开始时，大体上都能赶上原来班次的进度。  （全文完）
