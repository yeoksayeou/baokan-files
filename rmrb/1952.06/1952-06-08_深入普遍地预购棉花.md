    The sowing of cotton throughout the country is about to be completed this year, and cotton pre-purchase work by cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas has already begun. This year, entrusted by the state, cooperatives will be planning to pre-purchase 40 percent of all new cotton. This is an arduous task, and the National Cooperative Association's designation of it as the central task of cooperatives in the second quarter is entirely necessary.
    The method of pre-purchasing cotton by cooperatives began last year. The broad masses of cotton farmers fully support this new form of organized and planned exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, which is beneficial to their own production. Because cotton is a cash crop, and cotton farmers must sell most of their cotton in order to purchase necessary supplies for living and production. For many years, they have suffered from the intermediate exploitation of merchants, forced to sell cotton at low prices in the autumn and purchase necessities at high prices in the spring and after the autumn harvest. This unreasonable situation seriously dampened their enthusiasm for production. After the cooperatives implemented pre-purchase of cotton, cotton farmers, based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, signed pre-purchase cotton contracts with the cooperatives. According to the contract, they sell the cotton to the cooperatives at a reasonable price stipulated by the state in the autumn, and at the same time purchase means of production and supplies for living from the cooperatives at reasonable prices. This enables them to carry out production with peace of mind, without having to worry about fluctuations in cotton prices and grain prices. In the past, our purchase of cotton on the free market or through merchants resulted in considerable losses for both the state and the cotton farmers. Merchants often hoarded goods and manipulated market prices, making cotton farmers unwilling to sell cotton. This undermined the state's purchase plans and harmed the interests of the peasants. Now that the state can entrust the cooperatives to pre-purchase cotton from farmers, and at the same time systematically and organizedly sell industrial products and other goods to farmers, the state's economic plan can be gradually combined with the individual economy of the farmers.
    This year, the cooperative's pre-purchase of cotton mainly focuses on "credit pre-purchase," supplemented by "credit sales pre-purchase," implementing the spirit of the cooperative serving production, which is entirely correct. "Credit pre-purchase" is based on the increased political awareness of the broad masses of farmers. After the great production movement of the past year and the year before, the lives of farmers in our country are becoming increasingly prosperous, and their political awareness is constantly improving. They understand that their interests and the interests of the country are inseparable, and they are willing to pre-sell cotton to the state without having to obtain a deposit in advance. The erroneous view of some cooperative cadres that "pre-purchase is not possible without paying a deposit" has been negated by the facts. Facts have proven that it is entirely beneficial for farmers to pre-sell cotton to the state on credit, and then purchase the materials they need for production and living from the cooperatives, from the perspective of the whole year's production and living. As for some cotton farmers who do have difficulties at present, it is of course necessary for the state to allocate funds equivalent to 10 percent of the total value of pre-purchased cotton, entrusting cooperatives to implement "credit sales pre-purchase". Cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas should effectively use this fund, convert it into means of production and supplies for living, and sell it on credit to the farmers who need it most. The tendency of some cotton-producing area cooperatives to use pre-purchase cotton deposits unevenly last year must be corrected this year.
    The cooperative's pre-purchase of cotton should be targeted at agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and member groups, and further organize the individual and scattered cotton farmers in the pre-purchase process. The cooperative's signing of pre-purchase contracts with organized farmers not only ensures the reliable execution of the contract, but also facilitates the organization and assistance to help them improve production and solve difficulties in production and living. This will further organize the farmers and consolidate and develop the cooperatives. Last year, some cotton-producing area cooperatives signed pre-purchase cotton contracts with individual farmers or with one township or one village. As a result, most of these contracts could not be fulfilled. Because if pre-purchase contracts are signed with individual farmers, the number of contracts is too large for the cooperatives to manage; and if pre-purchase contracts are signed with one township or one village, the scope of the contracts is too large for the cooperatives to inspect. This lesson should absolutely not be repeated this year.
    The cooperative should not only sign pre-purchase cotton contracts with organized cotton farmers, but also sign supply contracts (ie "order forms") with these farmers. It can not only organically organize the production and life of the farmers; but also enable the cooperative to organize its own supply and marketing operations according to the provisions of the contract, and gradually move towards planned management. The quantity of materials included in the order form does not need to be too large, it is appropriate to reach about 30% of the total value of pre-purchased cotton; the types of materials included do not need to be too many, and should be limited to several main materials that cotton farmers need most (grain, cloth, fuel, fertilizer, salt); the specifications of the materials supplied do not need to be too strict, in order to give farmers the opportunity to choose flexibly. Some supply contracts could not be fulfilled last year because problems occurred in these three aspects, and attention must be paid to this this year.

### 深入普遍地预购棉花

    深入普遍地预购棉花
    今年全国棉花播种即将完成，各产棉区合作社预购棉花的工作已经展开。今年合作社接受国家的委托，有计划地向棉农预购全部新棉的百分之四十。这是一个繁重的任务，全国合作总社把它列为合作社第二季度的中心任务，是完全必要的。
    合作社预购棉花的办法，是从去年开始实行的。广大棉农十分拥护这种有利于自己的生产，和有组织、有计划的城乡物资交流的新形式。因为棉花是商品作物，而棉农是必须售出大部棉花，然后购入必需的生活资料和生产资料的。多少年来，他们饱受商人的中间剥削，被迫在秋季以低价出售棉花，而在春季和秋后则以高价购入必需品。这种不合理的情况严重地打击着他们的生产积极性。合作社实行预购棉花以后，棉农在自愿两利的原则下，和合作社订立了预购棉花合同，根据合同，他们在秋季按照国家规定的合理价格，把棉花卖给合作社，同时按照合理的价格向合作社购买生产资料和生活资料。这就使他们能够放心地进行生产，再不必顾虑棉价涨落和粮价升降了。过去我们在自由市场上购买或经过商人收购棉花，对国家和棉农的损失都是不小的。商人往往囤积居奇，捣乱市价，使棉农不愿意出卖棉花。这就破坏了国家的收购计划，损害了农民的利益。现在国家能够委托合作社向农民预购棉花，同时有计划地有组织地把工业品和其他物品卖给农民，这就使国家的经济计划能够和农民的个体经济逐渐结合起来。
    今年合作社预购棉花，以“信用预购”为主，以“赊销预购”为辅，贯彻了合作社为生产服务的精神，是完全正确的。“信用预购”是以广大农民政治觉悟的提高为基础的。我国农民经过去年和前年的大生产运动，生活日趋富裕，政治觉悟不断提高，他们懂得了自己的利益和国家的利益不可分割的道理，也愿意把棉花预售给国家，而不必预先取得定金。某些合作社干部以为“不付定金不能预购”的错误观点已为事实所否定了。事实证明，农民按照信用预购，把棉花预售给国家，到时向合作社购买他们在生产上和生活上所必需的物资，这从全年的生产和生活上来说，对于农民是完全有利的。至于有某些在眼前确有困难的棉农，国家拨出相当于预购棉花总值百分之十的资金，委托合作社实行“赊销预购”，自然也是必须的。各产棉区合作社应该有效地运用这笔资金，把它换成生产资料和生活资料，有重点地赊给最需要它的农民。去年若干产棉区的合作社平均使用预购棉花定金的偏向，今年必须加以纠正。
    合作社预购棉花，应以农业生产合作社、互助组和社员小组为对象，并进一步在预购过程中把个体的分散的棉农组织起来。合作社和有组织的农民订立预购合同，不仅使合同的执行获得可靠的保证，而且便于组织和帮助他们提高生产，帮助他们解决生产和生活方面的困难。这将进一步使农民组织起来，并使合作社获得巩固和发展。去年，某些产棉区合作社和个体农民或一乡、一村订立了预购棉花的合同，结果，这些合同大多数不能执行。因为和个体农民订立预购合同，则合同的数量太多，合作社无法掌握；而和一乡、一村订立预购合同，则合同的范围太大，合作社无法检查。这种教训，今年绝对不应重复。
    合作社不仅应该和有组织的棉农订立预购棉花合同，而且应该和这些棉农订立供应物资合同（即“定货单”）。它既可以使农民的生产和生活有机地组织起来；又可以使合作社按照合同的规定，组织自己的供销业务，逐步走上计划经营的道路。定货单所包括的物资数量不必过大，以达到预购棉花总值的百分之三十左右为宜；它所包括的物资种类也不必过多，以棉农最需要的几种主要物资（粮食、布匹、燃料、肥料、食盐）为宜；它所规定供给的物资规格不必过分严格，以便给予农民机动选择的机会。去年有些供应合同不能执行，就是因为在这三个方面发生了问题，今年必须加以注意。
