    Tianjin Private Zhenhua Wire Factory Workers Revise Patriotic Pact, Unite with Capitalists to Improve Production
    Lin Mo
    The patriotic pact newly established by the workers of the Tianjin Private Zhenhua Wire Factory after the "Five-Anti" campaign has played a significant role in uniting capitalists to improve production and supervising capitalists to eliminate the "five evils." The qualified rate of wire produced by this factory in April has reached 85% to 100%. The wire leaving the factory is guaranteed to fully meet specifications. In the past, due to capitalists deceiving workers and cutting corners, over 90% of the wire leaving the factory did not meet specifications.

    After the victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle, the workers and staff of Zhenhua Wire Factory immediately channeled their full enthusiasm into production. Under the leadership of Li Jialan, chairman of the trade union, and Wang Changyun, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, all employees took the initiative to consult with the capitalists and formulated a year-long production increase and conservation plan. Each group, based on the factory's plan, after thorough deliberation and discussion, included its production guarantees for a certain period in the patriotic pact. One of the main contents of each group's patriotic pact was to improve product quality and prevent capitalists from cutting corners again. The slogan was to prevent a single unqualified wire from leaving the factory. In order to realize this slogan, in addition to the workers conscientiously eliminating defective products and substandard goods in various production processes, they also suggested that the capitalists implement an inspection system: First, the factory purchased instruments for testing wires—megohmmeters and test pens—and added a finished product inspection room. Second, the insulation group created a fluorescent light box to check for pinholes in the rubber. Third, the factory entrusted the Electrical Engineering Department of Nankai University to test the insulation and conductivity of the wires. Fourth, the factory started using four-part order forms. In the past, the capitalists did not allow workers to know about orders and processing contracts signed with outside parties, so they could arbitrarily reduce the amount of materials used by workers during production, use inferior materials, and not produce according to specifications; now, three copies of the four-part order form (which specifies quality and specifications) are given to the sales department, the trade union, and the workshop workers, respectively, and one copy is kept for future reference. In this way, workers can carry out production and inspection according to the predetermined specification standards. Fifth, the factory started using product delivery notes. When delivering goods to buyers, the delivery person fills in the quantity, quality, and specifications, the warehouse releases the goods, and the receiver verifies and signs the note upon delivery and returns it for future inspection in case of problems. With such layer-by-layer inspection, it is very difficult for unqualified wires to leave the factory.

    In addition, in order to prevent capitalists from applying the "five evils" again, workers, under the leadership of the trade union, organized inspection teams to periodically check the capitalists' implementation of policies and laws such as the Common Program and the Trade Union Law, as well as the resolutions of labor-capital consultation meetings and the signed processing and ordering contracts.

    The reason why the employees of Zhenhua Wire Factory are able to implement the various guarantees written in their patriotic pact is that they have truly gained the position of masters after the "Five-Anti" movement, their class consciousness has been raised, and they have recognized the importance of actively uniting with capitalists to improve production.

    Before the "Five-Anti" movement, they also had a patriotic pact, but it did not work. At that time, workers were under the oppression of capitalists, often forced to work overtime, working as long as seventeen or eighteen hours a day; the factory's sanitation facilities and workers' housing and food were very poor. The workers were exhausted, listless, and emaciated. In order to oppress and illegally exploit workers, the capitalists used despicable means to undermine the trade union three times and bribed trade union cadres, seriously undermining the workers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, Zhenhua Wire Factory had always been a very backward factory in terms of production. The capitalists relied on applying the "five evils" to make money.

    In the "Five-Anti" movement, all workers and staff united to thoroughly expose and denounce the capitalists' illegal acts and educate the capitalists to recognize their mistakes. At the same time, the political awareness of the workers and staff was raised, solidarity was strengthened, and the trade union organization was also strengthened. The workers realized that the bad wires produced by the factory in the past had caused great harm to the country and the people, and that they must not allow the capitalists to produce bad wires again in the future. At the end of the "Five-Anti" movement, the factory's grassroots trade union, under the guidance and assistance of the higher-level trade union, took the initiative to hold two labor-capital consultation meetings with the capitalists to discuss how to improve production. In the consultation, the labor representatives put forward many improvement suggestions on adjusting machines, scientifically using and maintaining tools, improving labor organization, improving technology, and reasonably improving employee welfare and sanitary facilities, which increased the capitalists' confidence in management. The capitalists also proposed to add machines, purchase more employee dormitories, and improve accounting and personnel systems. Finally, the labor and capital jointly formulated a production increase and conservation plan for 1952. All 47 employees of the factory, under the principle of ensuring quality, planned to increase production and conservation with a total value of approximately 1.46 billion yuan for the whole year.

    The reason why Zhenhua Wire Factory is able to improve production in a planned way, and the capitalists, after being educated by the "Five-Anti" movement, are able to dispel various personal concerns, repent, and sincerely accept the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class, is also an important condition. Xu Zhizhou, the manager of the factory, had committed many illegal acts in the past, with illegal gains of nearly 1.2 billion yuan. When the People's Government initially mobilized him to confess, he suspected that they wanted to elicit his confession and then arrest and severely punish him. However, after he thoroughly confessed, the People's Government not only did not arrest him but allowed him to mobilize other illegal capitalists to confess and repent. At this time, he was worried that returning the embezzled money would cause his factory to collapse. Later, because he actively mobilized others to confess and performed meritorious service to atone for his crimes, the government reduced his sentence by one degree, changing him from a semi-illegal and semi-law-abiding household to a basically law-abiding household, and reduced most of the embezzled money he should have returned. At this time, he also thought that he had oppressed the workers too severely in the past and feared that the workers would retaliate against him. However, after he confessed and repented, the workers worked even more intensely and happily, wholeheartedly discussing with the capitalists how to improve production. Only then did he feel that obeying the leadership of the working class and respecting the trade union would only help him to improve production and business on the right path. Manager Xu Zhizhou and Deputy Manager Sun Futing both said that in the past, they would walk around the factory all day long, always afraid that the workers would work less and waste more materials; now, many things are led by the trade union to be discussed and handled by everyone, and they feel much more relaxed mentally. In the future, they will study policies and advanced management methods, and under the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class, develop their own factory.

    天津私营振华电线厂职工修订爱国公约团结资方搞好生产
    林沫
    天津私营振华电线厂的工人在“五反”运动以后新订立的爱国公约，对团结资方搞好生产、监督资方去掉“五毒”，已起了显著的作用。这个厂四月份生产的电线合格律已达到百分之八十五到百分之百。出厂的电线，则保证要完全合乎规格。而在过去，因资方欺骗工人，偷工减料，出厂的电线是百分之九十以上不合规格的。
    振华电线厂的工人，职员在“五反”斗争胜利后，立即把饱满的情绪转到生产上。全体职工在工会主席李嘉兰、青年团支部书记王昌运等的领导下，主动和资方协商，订出了全年的增产节约计划。各小组根据全厂的计划，经过充分酝酿讨论，把本组在一定时期内对生产的保证，订在爱国公约中。各组爱国公约的主要内容之一，就是提高产品质量，不许资本家再偷工减料。大家的口号是不让一根不合规格的电线出厂。为实现这个口号，除工人在各个生产过程中认真负责地消灭废品、次品以外，并建议资方实行了检查制度：一、购置了试验电线的仪器——摇表和试电笔，增设了成品检查室。二、包胶组为检查胶皮的砂眼，创造了一个日光灯箱。三、委托南开大学电机系代为化验电线的绝缘及导电率。四、使用四联订货单。过去资方和外边订的定货、加工合同不让工人知道，生产时可以随便让工人少用料，用次料，不按规格要求进行生产；现在则把四联订货单（上面写明质量规格）中的三联分别交给营业部、工会及车间工人，一联留下存查。这样，工人就可以根据预订的规格标准进行生产和检查。五、使用产品出厂单。在向买主交货时，由送货人填写数量、质量和规格，由仓库领出货物，在交货时，由收货人验明签字后收回，以备日后发生问题时进行检查。经过这样层层检查，不合格的电线是很难出厂了。
    另外，工人为防止资方再施“五毒”，曾在工会领导下组织了检查小组，定期地检查资方对共同纲领、工会法等政策法令及厂内劳资协商会议的决议、所签订的加工订货合同等执行的情形。
    振华电线厂的职工所以能够执行他们写在爱国公约中的各项保证，是因为他们经过“五反”运动，真正获得了主人翁的地位，阶级觉悟提高了，认识了主动团结资方搞好生产的重要。
    在“五反”运动以前，他们也订有爱国公约，但不能起作用。那时，工人处在资本家的压迫下，经常被迫加班加点，每天工作长达十七、八小时；工厂卫生设备和工人的宿、食都很坏。工人一个个累得无精打彩，面黄肌瘦。资本家为着压迫和非法剥削工人，曾以卑鄙的手段三次搞垮工会，并收买工会干部，严重地打击了工人的生产积极性。因此，振华电线厂过去在生产上始终是很落后的一个厂。资本家就靠着施用“五毒”来赚钱。
    在“五反”运动中，全厂工人、职员团结起来，彻底揭发和检举了资方的不法行为，教育资方认识了自己的错误。同时，工人、职员的政治觉悟提高了，团结加强了，工会组织也坚强了。工人们认识到过去工厂出产的坏电线，给国家和人民造成了很大危害，今后一定不许资方再出坏电线。该厂基层工会在“五反”运动结束时，即在上级工会的指示和帮助下，主动和资方举行了两次劳资协商会议，讨论如何改进生产。在协商中，劳方代表对调整机器、科学地使用和保管工具、改善劳动组织、提高技术和合理地改善职工福利及卫生设备等方面提出了许多改进意见，提高了资方的经营信心。资方也提出要添置机器、增购职工宿舍、改进会计和人事制度。最后，劳资双方共同订出了一九五二年的增产节约计划。全厂职工四十七人，在保证质量的原则下，计划全年增产节约总值约十四亿六千万元。
    振华电线厂所以能够有计划地改进生产，资方经过“五反”运动的教育，能够打消个人的种种顾虑，改过自新，诚心接受国营经济和工人阶级的领导，也是一个重要条件。该厂经理徐志周过去曾发生许多违法行为，违法所得近十二亿元。在人民政府最初动员他坦白时，他怀疑是要套出他的口供后，再逮捕严办他。而在他彻底坦白后，人民政府不但没有逮捕他，却是让他去动员别的违法资本家坦白悔过。这时，他又担心退赃会使自己的厂子垮台。后来，政府因他积极动员别人坦白，立功赎罪，把他罪减一等，由半违法、半守法户改为基本守法户，把他应退的赃款减去了大半。这时，他又想到过去压迫工人太厉害了，怕工人反过来报复他。但是，当他坦白悔过之后，工人却工作得更加紧张、愉快，一心一意地和资方商量如何搞好生产。这时他才感到，服从工人阶级的领导，尊重工会，只会帮助自己在正当的道路上搞好生产和营业。经理徐志周和副理孙福亭都说，过去他们一天在厂里转来转去，总怕工人少干活，多费料；现在，很多事情都有工会领导着大家讨论办理了，自己精神上轻松了许多。今后则是要学习政策和进步的经营管理方法，在国营经济和工人阶级的领导下，来发展自己工厂了。
