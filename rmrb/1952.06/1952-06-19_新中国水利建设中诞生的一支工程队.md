	On the south line of the Jingjiang River Diversion Project construction site, the concrete team led by Yu Ziliang is an outstanding engineering team. The team consists of thirty-one workers, most of whom are emancipated young peasants. A little over a year ago, they had not only never done concrete work and never seen large projects, but many of them had never even seen such engineering equipment. However, with the growth of New China's water conservancy construction, they learned five or six kinds of construction engineering techniques in projects such as harnessing the Yellow River and the Huai River, transforming from migrant workers who only knew how to carry earth into skilled technical workers. In the past year, they have won two glorious red flags and many prizes.

	The process of learning technology for the members of Yu Ziliang's team was arduous. Last year, when the Shi Mantan Reservoir was being built on the Huai River, they were transferred from earthwork to concrete work due to a severe shortage of technical workers. At that time, everything and every action in concrete mixing was unfamiliar and difficult to understand for them. Many people regarded the mixed concrete as horse manure or tofu dregs, not believing that "this thing could ever harden." Yu Ziliang himself did not understand the principle that cement sets when it meets water and once smeared cement on his face and feet, almost unable to get it off. Despite being so inexperienced, they were very enthusiastic about learning technology. They watched while carrying sand, keeping in mind the proportioning, watering, shoveling, and tamping. They consulted workers for what they didn't understand, learning with an open mind. With the workers' repeated explanations and patient help, they were soon able to mix concrete themselves. They also gradually understood the principles of combining various soil types and the ratio of cement to water during mixing. When the Shi Mantan Reservoir was completed, and they saw such a huge building erected with their own hands for the first time, they were all extremely happy, saying: "This is truly contributing to the construction of the motherland with our own technology." In this way, their confidence in learning technology became even higher. Subsequently, in the Yellow River's Shitou Zhuang Overflow Weir project, some learned how to lay railway tracks and tie steel bars, while others learned how to drill holes for blasting and drive foundation piles. To adapt to the need for learning technology, they also took time out from their rest periods to study culture, regardless of fatigue. Guo Zhenyu, who was previously illiterate, now not only knows four engineering techniques but also understands "meters" and "cubic meters," which are used as units of calculation in engineering; he understands how to read slopes, measure dike heights, and calculate earthwork volumes.

	This March, this concrete engineering team, nurtured by the New China's water conservancy construction, responded to the call of the Central People's Government and came from thousands of miles away to participate in the construction of the Jingjiang River Diversion Project. They said: "To permanently eliminate the scourge of floods for the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River, we must come to support it, no matter how far away it is. Building one more project means adding one more happiness to the people, and the industrialization of our country will be further advanced." After the construction of the gate concrete pouring project began, they rushed to work day and night to "race against the flood." When other teams put down their tools to rest, they took turns persisting in hard work. The young men of the team were all as lively as dragons and tigers, driving others to continuously improve labor efficiency and playing a great role in ensuring the project. Usually, they would not leave the work site even in light rain. When it rained heavily and they couldn't work, they seized the time to study and research technology. In this way, by May 20th, they had completed the concrete work on the three-hole pier and the twelfth-hole pier. Their team had half the number of people as other teams, but their results were the same as other teams, and the quality was even better. Therefore, they won first place in concrete work.

	In order to better serve the country's future construction, Yu Ziliang's team is now actively passing on the various techniques they have learned to the People's Liberation Army comrades who have newly joined the project, using the method of taking on apprentices; at the same time, they are vigorously delving into the mechanical aspects, learning to use cement mixers.

    新中国水利建设中诞生的一支工程队
    新华社记者  罗厚仁、姚昌淦
    荆江分洪工程南线工地上，于子良领导的一支混凝土小队，是一个出色的工程队。全队三十一个工人，大部分是翻身的青年农民。他们在一年多以前，不但没有做过混凝土工作，没有见过大的工程，很多人连这些工程器材都没有见过。但是随着新中国水利建设事业的成长，他们在治黄河、治淮河等工程中学会了五、六种建筑工程的技术，由只会挑土的民工变成熟练的技术工人。过去的一年时间内，他们曾经获得过两面光荣红旗和许多奖品。
    于子良小队的队员学习技术是一个艰苦的过程。去年淮河修石漫滩水库时，由于技术工人十分缺乏，他们才从土工方面被调到混凝土工方面。那时候，混凝土拌合工作中的一切事物和动作，对他们都是生疏难懂的。许多人把拌合好了的混凝土看作马粪、豆腐渣，不相信“这玩艺怎么会凝得起来”。于子良本人也不懂水泥见水就要凝结的道理，曾把水泥涂在脸上、脚上，几乎弄不下来。尽管这样外行，他们学习技术却很热心，他们一面挑砂一面看，把配料、浇水、翻锹、打钎等样样都看在心里。看不会的他们就向工人请教，虚心学习。在工人的反复讲解和耐心帮助下，他们很快就能动手拌合混凝土了。各种土质的结合的道理，拌合时灰和水的比例等等，他们也渐渐地懂得了。当石漫滩水库完工，他们第一次看到用自己的双手做起这样一个庞然的建筑物时，一个个都高兴得了不得，都说：这才真是用自己的技术为祖国的建设事业出了力了。这样，他们对学习技术的信心也就更高了。随后他们在黄河的石头庄溢洪堰工程中，有的又学会了铺铁轨、扎钢筋的工作；有的学会开山打炮眼、打基桩的工作。为了适应学习技术的需要，他们还不顾疲劳地抽出休息时间学文化。该队郭振宇过去一字不识，现在，他除了学会四门工程技术外，还懂得工程中当作计算单位的“公尺”、“公方”；懂得看坡度、量堤高以及收方等技术。
    今年三月，这支由新中国水利建设事业培养出来的混凝土工程队，又响应中央人民政府的号召，从数千里外赶来参加兴修荆江分洪工程。他们说：为了荆江两岸人民永灭水患，再远些也要来支援。多修一个工程，就多为人民增加一份幸福，咱们国家的工业化也就更进一步了。建闸浇灌混凝土工程开始后，他们为了“和洪水赛跑”，不分日夜地突击赶工。别的队放下工具休息了，他们却轮流坚持苦干。该队的年轻小伙子们，个个像生龙活虎一样，带动别人不断地提高劳动效率，对工程起了很大的保证作用。平常下小雨，他们都不离开工场。大雨天不作工，他们就抓紧时间学习和研究技术。这样，到五月二十号他们就完成了所担负的三孔闸墩和第十二孔闸墩混凝土工程。他们小队的人数比别的队少一倍，但成绩和别队一样，质量还比人家强。因此，他们荣获混凝土工的第一名。
    为了更好地为祖国将来的建设事业服务，现在，于子良小队一面采取带徒弟的办法，积极地把已学会的各种技术传授给新参加工程的解放军同志；一面正在猛烈地向机械方面钻研，学习使用洋灰拌合机。
