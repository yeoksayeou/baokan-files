How I Created the Automatic Lathe Tool Holder
    Xiao Fuli, Oral Account; Wang Chongxun, Recorder

    I am a fifth-grade lathe operator at the Jinan Second Machine Factory of the East China Industrial Department. Before liberation, I worked in this factory. My grandfather was killed by the local tyrant Xiao Wenlong, and my father, a porter, was bombed to death by the Japanese devils. My mother was killed by the local tyrant Zhang Xiuwu. Remembering the various torments I suffered in the old society, I feel even more the greatness of the Communist Party. Therefore, after liberation, I put all my strength into production, doing as much work as I could. I have received six awards. In October 1949, I honorably joined the Communist Youth League.

    The automatic lathe tool holder I created can increase production efficiency fivefold. If it is fully implemented in our factory, it can increase the country's wealth by nearly 10 billion yuan a year.

    Speaking of the process of creating the automatic lathe tool holder, it's a long story. In the spring of 1951, I watched a movie called "High Song and Vigorous Advance." There was a scene in the film depicting a worker using high-speed cutting to machine lead screws, with a speed of only 380 revolutions. Because there wasn't enough time to retract the tool, the tool and the workpiece were damaged together. This left a deep impression on me. At that time, I thought: If the problem of tool retraction is not solved when implementing high-speed cutting, it is really worrying, and there might be accidents when operating the lathe. Wouldn't it solve all the problems of tool retraction if automatic tool retraction and automatic tool feeding methods were used instead of manual operation? From then on, I kept thinking about this matter over and over again. However, soon after, I suffered a serious illness and couldn't get out of bed for many days. As time went by, I forgot about it.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement began, the factory required "fighting tigers and production without delay." Comrade Li Zuoting, the Party branch secretary, called on all Party members and Youth League members at a meeting to actively find tricks and support the "fighting tigers" struggle with practical actions. At this time, I thought: I am a member of the Youth League and should use my brains to improve tools and respond to the Party's call. At this time, the production tasks of our lathe department were very heavy. The task of the eight-foot electric lathe was obviously impossible to complete. Coincidentally, lathe operator Li Zonggui encountered difficulties in making the five-millimeter one-thread, six-millimeter one-groove car head tile: he couldn't retract the tool at all when driving the lead screw at high speed, so he had to work slowly. Otherwise, he would damage the tool, damage the workpiece, and possibly damage the chuck. Seeing this situation, I was very anxious, but I couldn't think of a good solution. One day, I was standing gloomily by the lathe. Liu Meiting, a member of the Party branch committee (and a worker who worked on the same lathe as me), saw this situation and came over and asked me, "Xiao Fuli, what are you thinking about again! I think the difficulty raised by Li Zonggui a few days ago is indeed a big problem. Think about it, can we make the tool holder automatic?" His words reminded me. I immediately remembered the plan to create an automatic lathe tool holder after watching "High Song and Vigorous Advance." From then on, I officially began to think. At night, Liu Meiting and I discussed together and drew pictures together, often going to bed after one o'clock in the morning. During the day, I was also thinking about it while working. Sometimes, I would forget where I put the calipers I was holding. People said, "Old Xiao has gone crazy." After thinking for four or five days in a row, I came up with a preliminary idea of creating an automatic tool retraction, automatic tool engagement, and automatic tool feeding method. I thought: Use two round pieces of iron to make a variator (or called yin-yang meng) with convex and concave angles of 90 degrees each, and install it on the head of the hand-crank lead screw; add a spring to the hand-crank lead screw to push against the tool holder; then install a lever under the variator and install baffles on both ends so that the linkage on the variator pushes against the baffles. In this way, when the carriage advances to the specified dimension, the linkage touches the baffle, the variator closes, and the tool automatically retracts. When the carriage returns, the linkage touches the baffle again to open the variator, and then pulls the lead screw, and the tool automatically engages again. I also added a gear outside the variator based on the principle of the gun gear on a small planer and hooked it with a short hook. In this way, the tool can be automatically fed. As for the amount of tool feed, it can be controlled by changing the gear according to the scale on the dial.

    I told Liu Meiting my idea. Liu Meiting thought it made sense. I also went to discuss it with the team leader. The team leader, Zhang Jusen, simply said, "It needs further study." Although the team leader did not actively support me, I was not discouraged. Liu Meiting and I went to ask the director for instructions. We were afraid that the director would disagree, so we asked to work overtime to test it for him. Director Bi Yizao actively encouraged us. He said, "Don't worry, this is creation, just do it during working hours." Encouraged by the director, we jumped and ran to the scrap iron pile to find some waste materials and carefully tested them. At this time, some old workers said, "Don't think it's a good idea, the 90-degree variator will definitely not be able to be pulled open." Hearing this, I also felt that I didn't have much confidence; after dinner, I immediately ran back to the workshop and found a 90-degree angle iron and fitted it on the 90-degree inclined back of the lathe for testing. The result was feasible. Feeling confident, I began to work boldly and made the tool holder in three days. When test-driving, because the variator was not firmly engaged, the brake fell down and the tool could not be engaged. Some comrades shook their heads silently when they saw this. The first experiment failed. However, I was not discouraged. I thought: "It is not surprising that the first failure, as long as you can learn from the lessons, you will always succeed." Based on the situation of this experiment, I repeatedly checked and found that the variator was too straight, so I filed a small platform one millimeter deep on it. The result of the second experiment solved the problem of not being able to engage the tool.

    Although it could automatically engage and retract the tool, and also automatically feed the tool, the large carriage still moved forward to the specified dimension, so the hand brake had to be used first; otherwise, in high-speed conditions, the carriage would move at a speed of 150 meters per minute, which could easily damage the chuck and the tool holder. I considered: If the brake handle could also be automatically raised and lowered, there would be no danger. But how to do it? I thought back and forth, looking for examples and analogies. I found the way. I remembered that Liu Meiting had said before that the firing pin spring on a mortar could fire the shell as soon as you let go of it with your hand. If two such springs were also installed on the lifting brake, it would probably work.

    Liu Meiting and I went to the team leader and told him this idea. He said, "There is no need for automatic lifting and lowering brakes." Some individual workers also said, "This is a machine, not fooling a child, it won't be so easy, it's just nonsense." Seeing this situation, Liu Meiting was afraid of affecting my mood, so he encouraged me and said, "Because this is a new thing, it is inevitable that some people will not support it before it is successful. But after these days of efforts, we already have a foundation, as long as we continue to study, the chances of success are very high." He has been helping me with my research. Workshop Director Bi Yizao also encouraged me. He said, "You just create boldly, the department will definitely help you. If there are major difficulties, I will ask the factory director for instructions." All of this increased my courage to overcome difficulties and made me determined to study it to the end. I drew a picture according to the principle I came up with, and then made two springs according to the drawing. The experimental results showed that the brake could be automatically raised and lowered.

    After several experiments, although the difficulties were overcome, the automatic tool holder was not perfect: the carriage on the tool holder could not automatically move forward and backward. I also figured out a way for the large carriage to automatically move forward and backward based on the principle of the reverse buckle. This is to put a shallow reverse buckle on the lead screw and add a brake shoe. In this way, when the brake shoe of the lead screw falls, the brake shoe of the lead screw will rise, and the large carriage will automatically move forward. Conversely, when the brake shoe of the lead screw falls, the brake shoe of the lead screw will rise, and the large carriage will automatically return.

    On April 22, I finally worked out all three parts above. The automatic lathe tool holder was considered a complete success. On the first day of all the installations, a performance was held in the workshop, and the results were very good. Everyone rushed to shake hands with me. Comrades loved me. The success of this creation should be attributed to the cultivation of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, and to the support and help of the leaders and worker brothers.

    This automatic lathe tool holder can be used on all lathes. However, I tested it on a belt lathe. If an automatic tool holder is installed on an electric lathe, it needs to be further improved. I have improved it in three points.

    1. According to the principle of the variator, a rack is installed on the side of the large carriage, and a gear is installed on the rack; the horizontal lead screw on the tool holder is connected to this gear, and then threads are cut inside the rack to pull the lead screw; springs are installed on both ends of the rack, and when the carriage moves back to the specified place, it touches and engages the tool; when the carriage moves forward to the specified place, it touches and retracts the tool. Therefore, it can replace the variator.

    2. According to the principle of the flashlight switch, on the basis of the original lifting brake, a spring is used to strike back and forth, which can play the same role.

    3. As for the automatic forward and backward movement of the large carriage, only one spring is needed to pull it. One side of the spring is connected to the carriage, and the other side is connected to the right end of the bed surface. In this way, when the lead screw brake falls, the carriage moves forward; when it is raised, the carriage automatically returns due to the traction of the spring.

    我是怎样创造车床自动刀架的
    萧福利　口述  王崇训　记
    我是华东工业部济南第二机器厂的五级车工。解放以前，我就在这个工厂做工。我祖父被恶霸萧文龙害死了，我父亲是一个搬运工人，他被日本鬼子炸死了。我母亲被恶霸张秀武害死了。想起在旧社会里所受的各种折磨，我更感到共产党的伟大。所以，解放以后，我在生产上有多大力气就使多大力气，能干多少活就干多少活。我曾得过六次奖。一九四九年十月，我光荣地参加了青年团。
    我创造的车床自动刀架，可以提高生产效率五倍。要是在我们厂里全面推广起来，一年可以为国家增加近百亿元的财富。
    提起我创造车床自动刀架的经过，话就长了。一九五一年春天，我看过一部名叫“高歌猛进”的电影。影片里有一个镜头，描写工人用高速切削法车丝杠，转速仅仅三百八十转，因来不及退刀，连刀带活一起碰坏了。这给我留下了很深刻的印象。当时我就想：如果实行高速切削法不解决退刀的问题，真是叫人不放心，开起车来，说不定就会出岔子。要是用自动退刀、自动进刀的方法来代替手工操作，不是就解决了退刀上的一切问题了吗？从那时起，我就天天反来覆去地捉摸这件事。可是，不久，我就害了一场重病，很多日子没能起床。日子长了，也就把这件事忘了。
    “三反”运动开始后，厂里要求“打虎生产两不误”。党的支部书记李作亭同志在党员、团员会议上，号召全体党员、团员积极找窍门，用实际行动来支援“打虎”斗争。这时，我就想：我是一个青年团员，应该开动脑筋，改进工具，响应党的号召。这时候，我们车工部里的生产任务非常繁重。八呎电动车床的任务，眼看着就完不成。真巧，车工李宗桂做五米厘一扣、六米厘一糟的车头瓦遇到了困难：他开快车车丝杠，根本退不出刀来，只好慢吞吞地干。不然，就会弄坏刀，弄坏活，还可能把卡盘搞坏了。看到这种情形，我心里很着急，但又想不出好办法。有一天，我正在守着床子闷沉沉地站着，党的支部委员刘梅亭（和我在一部床子上做工的工人）看了这种情形，就过来问我：“萧福利，你又想什么事啊！我看，前几天李宗桂提出的那个困难，确实是个大问题。你想想看，咱能不能把刀架子弄成自动的？”他这几句话提醒了我。我立刻想起看了“高歌猛进”以后准备创造车床自动刀架的计划。从这时起，我就正式开始思考。晚上，我和刘梅亭两个人一起讨论，一起画图，往往到深夜一点钟以后才睡觉。白天，我干活时也在想着。有时候，手里拿着卡尺就忘了往那里放。人们都说：“老萧是得了神经病啦。”一连想了四、五天，才初步想出了创造自动退刀，自动吃刀，自动进刀的方法。我想：用两块圆铁做成凸凹各九十度的变动器（或叫阴阳盂），把它安装在手摇丝杠的头上；在手摇丝杠上再加一根簧，顶着刀架；再在变动器下边装一根杠，两头装上档板，使变动器上的连动器顶着档板。这样，当拖板前进到规定的尺度的时候，连动器碰着档板，变动器合拢起来，刀就自动退出了。当拖盘回来的时候，连动器又碰着档板使变动器张开，然后牵动丝杠，就又自动吃上刀了。我又根据小刨车上枪齿轮的原理，在变动器外边加上一个牙轮，并用一个短短的小钩把它钩住。这样，就可以自动进刀。至于进刀量，只要按着刻度盘的比例，调换牙轮，就可以掌握了。
    我把自己的想法告诉刘梅亭。刘梅亭认为很有道理。我又去和组长研究。组长张聚森只是很简单地说“还要研究。”虽然组长没有积极支持我，但我并没有灰心。我和刘梅亭去请示主任。我们怕主任不同意，就要求加夜班试做给他看。主任毕意藻积极鼓励我们。他说：“不要顾虑，这是创造，就在工作时间搞吧。”得到了主任的鼓励，我们就连蹦带跳地跑到废铁堆中找了些废料，细心地试做起来。这时候，有的老工人说：“别看想得很好，九十度的变动器准拔不开。”我听了，也觉得没有大把握；吃过晚饭，立刻跑回车间，找了一块九十度的三角铁，合在车床九十度的斜背上进行试验。结果能行。我心里有底了，就开始大胆地做，三天后就把刀架做好了。在试车的时候，因为变动器咬得不结实，闸就落下来了，吃不上刀。有的同志看了，就不言不语地摇头。第一次试验失败了。可是，我并没有泄气。我认为：“初次失败是不奇怪的，只要能接受教训，总会成功的。”根据这次试验的情况，我反复地进行了检查，发现变动器太直，便在上面锉了一米厘深的小平台。第二次试验的结果，解决了吃不上刀的毛病。
    虽然能自动吃刀、退刀，也能自动进刀了，但是大拖板到了规定的尺度，还是往前走，这就必须先用手提闸；不然的话，在高速的情况下，拖板每分钟以一百五十公尺的速度前进，很容易碰坏卡盘和刀架。我考虑：要是连闸把也是自动提，自动落，那就没危险了。可是怎么搞呢？我就想前想后，找例子，寻比方。我找到门道了。我想起刘梅亭以前曾经说过，迫击炮上的撞针簧，用手捏着，一松手就能把炮弹发出去。如果在提落闸上，也装上这样两个簧，大概也能行。
    我和刘梅亭去找组长，把这个道理告诉他。他说：“用不着自动起落闸。”也有个别工人说：“这是机器，不是哄小孩呀，那会这样容易，简直是胡闹。”刘梅亭看到这种情形，怕影响了我的情绪，就鼓励我说：“因为这是一件新事，在没有成功以前，难免有人不拥护。可是经过这些天的努力，已经有了底了，只要继续研究，成功的把握是很大的。”他一直帮助我研究。车间主任毕意藻也鼓励我。他说：“你只管大胆地创造，部里一定帮助你。如有大困难，我就去请示厂长。”这一切，都增加了我克服困难的勇气，使我决心研究到底。我按照自己想出的道理画了图，又照图样做好两个簧。试验结果，闸可以自动地起落了。
    经过几次试验，困难虽然都克服了，但自动刀架还不是尽善尽美的：刀架上的拖盘还不能自动进退。我又根据反正扣的原理，琢磨出大拖板自动进退的办法。这就是在光杠上套上浅反扣，再加上一个闸瓦。这样丝杠的闸瓦落下去，光杠的闸瓦就提起来，大拖板就自动前进。反过来，光杠的闸瓦落下去，丝杠的闸瓦就提起来，大拖板就自动退回了。
    四月二十二日，我终于把以上三个部分都研究好了。车床自动刀架也就算全部成功了。在全部装好的第一天，在车间里进行了表演，成绩很好。大家都抢着和我握手。同志们爱戴我。这个创造的成功，应归功于共产党、青年团对我的培养，归功于领导同志和工人兄弟们对我的支持和帮助。
    这个车床自动刀架，在所有的车床上都可以采用。但是，我是在皮带车床上试验的。如果在电动车床上装置自动刀架，还要进一步加以改进。我已改进了三点。
    一、根据变动器的原理，在大拖板边上装上一根牙条，在牙条上装一个牙轮；把刀架上的横丝杠串在这个牙轮里，再在牙条里边车丝扣，牵引丝杠；牙条两头都装簧，拖板往后走到规定的地方，一碰，就吃上刀了；拖板往前走到规定的地方，一碰，就退了刀。因此，可以代替变动器。
    二、根据手电门的原理，在起落闸原有的基础上，改用一根簧来回打，能起同等作用。
    三、至于大拖板自动进退，只用一根簧拉就可以了。把簧的一边衔在拖板上，一边衔在床面的右端。这样，丝杠闸落下去，拖板就前进；提起来，拖板因受簧的牵引，就自动退回。
