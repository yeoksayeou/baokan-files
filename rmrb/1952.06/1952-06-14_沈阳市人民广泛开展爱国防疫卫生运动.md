    Shenyang Municipal People Widely Launch Patriotic Anti-epidemic Health Campaign
    The Shenyang Municipal People's Government led the people of the city to widely launch a patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign, providing a good example for urban mass health work. According to incomplete statistics from March and April, the city cleared more than 208,000 tons of garbage, more than 54,000 tons of manure, and dredged more than 748,000 meters of sewage ditches, as well as improving water sources and building many toilets. In addition, more than 40,000 square meters of puddles have been filled in, and more than 100,000 livestock pens and poultry houses have been renovated.
    Through this campaign, the city's environmental hygiene and residents' personal hygiene conditions have been greatly improved. The long-standing "garbage mountains" in the South District and Tiexi District have been rebuilt into clean and beautiful squares, and a muddy street in the Shenhe District has been renovated into a flat road. Eighty-three percent of the city's sanitation industries have been repeatedly inspected and their sanitation equipment has been thoroughly improved. Most of the open-air food stalls have been banned, and other food stalls have been fitted with fly-proof gauze covers or glass covers, and the staff have put on clean white work clothes. Good hygiene habits have begun to be cultivated among most residents. In late March alone, 80 percent of the city's residents dismantled and washed their bedding, and many residents thoroughly cleaned the dust that had not been touched for many years under indoor cabinets and kang mats.
    During the campaign, the people of the city displayed unprecedented enthusiasm. The slogan "No rats in every household, no insects in every household" has become a well-known practical action. Residents of Jihong Street in Tiexi District proposed eight methods for cleaning, pest control, and rat catching: finding, hitting, burning, blocking, smearing, boiling, filling, and checking. Women in Shenhe District proposed to achieve "eight cleanlinesses" (children, body, indoor, outdoor, tableware, livestock pens, streets, toilets). Many street women organized temporary baby care classes to participate in garbage cleaning; many residents voluntarily donated materials and labor to help with cleaning work. At present, many model hygiene streets, model industries, and "fly-free" and "insect-free" model resident groups have emerged in the city.
    In the patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign, the vast number of citizens came up with a variety of effective anti-epidemic methods. A certain pancake shop in Huanggu District installed a "three-proof sealed mill cover" on the mill to prevent flies, dirt, and dust from contaminating food. Zhao Hancheng, a worker at the Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory, and Yang Xiu and Xu Xinmin, residents of Maojuntun in Beiguan District, developed a steam lice-killing device that can steam more than 100 pieces of clothing at a time. At an experience exchange conference on inventions and creations in the North District, more than 50 tools for catching rats and killing insects were exhibited.
    The successful launch of Shenyang's patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign is due to the full mobilization of the masses and the establishment of a strong people's anti-epidemic front. Anti-epidemic organizations at all levels have been universally established and improved throughout the city. Within two months, with the assistance of medical institutions, the city trained more than 65,000 mass activists, who became the core force in the anti-epidemic health campaign. In particular, the widespread mobilization of street women has added tremendous strength to the anti-epidemic front.
    Several months of experience have proven that using exhibitions and organized visits to promote typical experiences and supervise the transformation of backward areas is also an important reason for the success of Shenyang's patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign. At the beginning of the campaign, the anti-epidemic leading organs in various districts of the city successively held dirt exhibitions. Catering staff and food vendors who visited the exhibitions were inspired and expressed their determination to no longer buy or sell rotten food and to pay attention to food hygiene at all times. The South District organized a visiting group of 236 people from 17 streets to visit the residential area of Fourteenth Weilu, a model hygiene street in the district. The strictness of the street's anti-epidemic organization system, the residents' enthusiasm for participating in hygiene work, and the improvement of hygiene standards greatly influenced the visitors, and many people thereby overcame complacency and paralysis. After returning from the visit, the residents of Maluwan Street immediately held a meeting to study their advanced working methods, and the Fifth Central Group of Maluwan Street has since improved its past hygiene conditions. Through exhibitions and visits, the various advanced experiences and effective anti-epidemic tools created by the masses have been rapidly popularized and promoted. The "three-proof sealed mill cover" created by Zhang Yun, a resident of Huanggu District, has now been installed in 60 percent of the pancake shops in the district; Maojuntun in Beiguan District has adopted a "steam lice-killing device" and established three lice-killing stations, and some resident groups have become "lice-free model groups." More than 50 of the more than 100 insect-catching and anti-epidemic appliances invented and created by residents of the North District are also being promoted and tested.
    In order to maintain and continue to improve the existing level of hygiene, some areas and units in Shenyang are currently establishing fixed, regular anti-epidemic hygiene systems and formulating anti-epidemic hygiene covenants. Some are further rectifying and improving anti-epidemic hygiene organizations and establishing inspection groups for regular inspections to ensure the regularization of anti-epidemic hygiene work.

    沈阳市人民广泛开展爱国防疫卫生运动
    沈阳市人民政府领导全市人民广泛开展了爱国防疫卫生运动，给城市群众卫生工作提供一个好的例子。据三、四月份不完全统计，全市共清除垃圾二十万八千多吨，粪便五万四千多吨；疏通污水沟长达七十四万八千多公尺，并整顿水源、修建厕所多处。此外，四万多平方公尺的水坑已经填平，十万多个畜圈和禽舍都经过了翻修。
    经过这一运动，市内环境卫生和居民个人卫生状况已大为改进。南市区和铁西区陈年日久的“垃圾山”已改建为整洁美观的广场，沈河区一条泥泞街道已翻修成平坦马路。全市百分之八十三的卫生行业经过反复检查，彻底改善了卫生设备。露天饮食摊贩已大部取缔，其他食品摊贩也都设置了防蝇的纱布罩或玻璃罩，伙计们都穿上了干净的白色工作服。良好的卫生习惯已在大多数居民中开始养成。仅在三月下旬，全市就有百分之八十的居民拆洗了被褥，许多居民彻底清除了室内箱柜和炕席底下多年未动的尘土。
    在运动中，全市人民发挥了空前的积极性。“家家无鼠、户户无虫”的口号，已成为家喻户晓的实践行动。铁西区霁虹街居民提出了清扫、灭虫、捕鼠工作的找、打、烧、堵、抹、煮、填、查等八项办法；沈河区的妇女提出要做到“八净”（孩子、身体、室内、室外、食具、畜圈、街道、厕所）。许多街道妇女为了参加打扫垃圾，组织了临时婴儿看护班；许多居民自动献物、献工，帮助进行清扫工作。目前全市已出现很多卫生模范街、模范行业以及“无蝇”、“无虫”的模范居民组。
    广大市民在爱国防疫卫生运动中，想出多种多样的有效的防疫方法。皇姑区某煎饼铺在磨上安设了“三防密闭磨罩”，可以防止苍蝇、脏物和灰尘沾染食物。沈阳第一机器厂的工人赵汉城和北关区毛君屯居民杨秀、徐新民等曾研究出一种蒸汽灭虱器，一次即可蒸煮百余件衣服。北市区在一次发明创造经验交流大会上，展览出五十多件捕鼠灭虫的工具。
    沈阳市爱国防疫卫生运动的胜利开展，是由于充分发动群众，建立了强大的人民防疫战线。全市普遍建立和健全了各级防疫组织。两个月内在医务机关的协助下，全市训练了六万五千多名群众积极分子，成为防疫卫生运动中的核心力量。特别是街道妇女广泛的发动，更使防疫战线增加了巨大的力量。
    几个月的经验证明：用举办展览、组织参观的方法，推广典型经验，督促落后转变，也是沈阳市爱国防疫卫生运动收到成效的一个重要原因。在运动开始时，市内各区防疫领导机关，曾相继举办了脏物展览会，各单位前往参观的炊事人员和食品商贩，从展览会上得到启示，纷纷表示今后决心不再买卖腐烂食品，时刻注意食物卫生。南市区组织了十七个街的二百三十六人的参观团，到该区卫生模范街十四纬路的居民住宅区参观。这个街道的防疫组织制度的严密，居民参加卫生工作的积极性以及卫生水平的提高，给予参观者以很大影响，许多人因而克服了自满和麻痹思想。马路湾街的居民参观回来后，马上开会研究他们的先进工作方法，马路湾街第五中心组从此改进了过去卫生状况。经过展览和参观，群众中所创造的各种先进经验和有效的防疫工具，迅速地得到普及和推广。皇姑区居民张云所创造的“三防密闭磨罩”，现已在该区百分之六十的煎饼铺中安装；北关区毛君屯已采用“蒸气灭虱器”，设立了三个灭虱站，有的居民组已成为“无虱模范组”。北市区居民所发明和创造的一百多件捕虫和防疫用具中，也有五十多件正在推广试用。
    为了保持并继续提高现有的卫生水平，目前沈阳市若干地区和单位正在建立固定的经常性防疫卫生制度，订立防疫卫生公约。有的正在进一步整顿和健全防疫卫生组织，成立检查团，定期检查，以保证防疫卫生工作的经常化。  （新华社）
