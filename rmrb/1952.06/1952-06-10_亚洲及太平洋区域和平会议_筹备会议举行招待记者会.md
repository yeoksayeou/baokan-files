    Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Preparatory Meeting Holds Press Reception

    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held a press reception on the evening of the 8th. More than 30 representatives from China, India, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, Australia, Mexico, Vietnam, Indonesia, Canada, Burma, Ceylon, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaya, and other countries attending the preparatory meeting, and more than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the reception.

    The reception was presided over by Li Dequan, representative of the Chinese delegation. She said in her opening remarks: The gathering of representatives from twenty countries in Beijing is extremely significant for the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific regions. After four days of harmonious exchange of views and friendly discussions, the meeting has synthesized various different viewpoints into a common language and, with complete unanimity (no one opposed, no one abstained), adopted the declaration of the preparatory meeting and the proposals for various preparatory tasks for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. This is a very important achievement. After Li Dequan's speech, reporters raised questions, which were answered separately by representatives from various countries.

    Indian representative D.D. Kosambi answered a reporter's question about the achievements of the meeting. In his reply, he emphasized that the achievement of the meeting was the manifestation of the great unity of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions. Kosambi mentioned the current economic difficulties in India and pointed out that the solution was to eliminate the current international tension and restore free trade.

    Burmese chief representative U Hla answered a question about how the people would work to promote an early armistice in Korea, saying: The Korean War is closely related to world peace. Representatives must return to their countries to promote people's understanding of this issue and convey to the people of all countries the evidence they have seen with their own eyes of the imperialists conducting germ warfare.

    Soviet representative Kozhevnikov, in expressing his opinion on the meeting, emphasized the broad nature of the peace movement reflected by the meeting. He said: The guiding spirit of this meeting is the free exchange of views and the free expression of opinions. Different thoughts, viewpoints, and opinions were exchanged and discussed, and finally reached consensus on the main essential issues. This harmony and consensus is the guiding principle that runs through the work of the entire meeting and the main guarantee for the success of the meeting's future work.

    Japanese representative Tomi Kora answered reporters' questions, saying: After participating in this meeting, the Japanese representatives deeply felt how concerned the people of all countries are about the issue of Japan's re-militarization. At the meeting, every representative felt the threat of Japan's re-militarization. Kora said that a prominent memory of her participation in this meeting was that the Chinese people, on the one hand, deeply remembered the disasters that Japanese militarism had brought to them and hated them for it, but on the other hand, they clearly distinguished between the Japanese people and the Japanese militarists, and expressed their love for the Japanese people. She mentioned how the meeting respected the opinions of the Japanese representatives when formulating the declaration, and said that the declaration would help the Japanese people understand that they can rely on the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to support the Japanese people's efforts for peaceful construction.

    Pakistani representative Ghulam Muhammad Khan answered reporters' questions, saying: The two world wars, the wars in Korea and Vietnam, and the Anglo-American intervention in Egypt and Iran, these facts all show that without peace, there is nothing.

    Australian representative Van Ildere, in answering reporters' questions, pointed out that after participating in this meeting, the Australian representatives understood the real situation in the Asian and Pacific regions and broadened their horizons for the movement to defend peace. The Australian representatives must work hard to strive for peace after returning home, and they will certainly succeed.

    A reporter from the Korean Central News Agency raised the facts of the United States using bacteriological and chemical weapons at the meeting and asked the American representative to express his opinion on this issue. American representative Kingsbury said in his reply: Due to the distorted reports in American newspapers, he had doubted the accusations against the American government for conducting germ warfare and doubted the certainty of such accusations. But after arriving in Beijing, he saw irrefutable evidence in the germ warfare exhibition. Kingsbury finally praised the spirit of unity among the representatives attending the meeting, saying that this spirit can win peace and create human fraternity.

    The reception ended with mutual applause from the representatives and reporters.

    缅甸首席代表吴拉答复关于人民将如何努力来促使朝鲜早日停战的问题时说：朝鲜战争与世界和平有密切关系，代表们回国去要促进人民对这一问题的了解，并且把亲眼看到的关于帝国主义进行细菌战的证据传达给各国人民。
    苏联代表科热夫尼科夫发表对会议的意见时着重指出会议所反映的和平运动的广泛性质。他说：这次会议的主导精神是自由交换意见和自由发表意见。各种不同的思想、观点和意见经过交换和讨论，终于在主要的本质的问题上得到一致。这种和谐一致是贯彻在整个会议的工作中的指导原则，也是会议今后工作成功的主要保证。
    日本代表高良富答记者问时说：日本代表们这次参加会议之后，深深感到反对日本重新军国主义化的问题是如何为各国人民所关切。在会议上，每个代表都感到日本重新军国主义化的威胁。高良富说她参加这次会议的一个突出的记忆就是中国人民一方面深深记得日本军国主义所曾带给他们的灾祸而对它们痛恨，但另一方面他们明白地把日本人民与日本军国主义者区别开来，而对日本人民表示了友爱。她提到会议在制订宣言时如何尊重日本代表的意见，并说宣言将帮助日本人民了解他们可以信赖亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民支援日本人民和平建设的努力。

    澳大利亚代表范·伊尔德在答复记者的问题时，指出澳大利亚代表们参加了这次会议后，认识了亚洲及太平洋区域的真实情况，并扩大了对于保卫和平运动的眼界。澳大利亚代表们回国之后，一定要努力去争取和平，而且一定会获得成功。
    朝鲜中央通讯社的记者在会上提出美国使用细菌武器和化学武器的事实，请美国代表对这个问题表示意见。美国代表金斯伯利在答复中说：由于美国报纸的歪曲报道，他曾经怀疑对美国政府进行细菌战的指责，怀疑这种指责的确凿性。但在到达北京后，他看到了细菌战展览会中无可辩驳的证据。金斯伯利最后称赞了出席这次会议的代表们的团结精神，他说这种精神能够赢得和平及造成人类的友爱。
    招待会在代表们和记者们互相鼓掌声中结束。
