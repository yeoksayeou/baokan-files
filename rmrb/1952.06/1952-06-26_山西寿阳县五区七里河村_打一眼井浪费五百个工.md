Digging a Well Wasted Five Hundred Workdays

Editor:

During the spring drought resistance campaign, the masses in Qilihe Village, Fifth District, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, dug a well and wasted five hundred workdays. The water level of this well was only five feet below the ground, but the well shaft was dug to a depth of two zhang and five chi. As a result, the well shaft was full of water, and the water needed to be bailed out before bricks could be laid. Unfortunately, it rained for a day, and the well shaft collapsed. People didn't study how to remedy the situation, so they started digging again in the same place. Originally, this well could have been completed with only one hundred and twenty-five workdays, but it ended up taking six hundred and twenty-five workdays.

This loss was caused by a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Government who was sent to work in this township. This comrade didn't go deep into the work and didn't explain the rationale for digging wells to prevent drought to the masses. Instead, he forced the masses to dig wells by administrative order. Before digging the well, he didn't carry out careful planning, and the preparatory work wasn't done well, which led to the loss. In this well digging project, fourteen beneficiary households should have provided labor according to the rules, but these fourteen households were unwilling to dig the well. The staff member consulted with the village cadres and asked all the villagers to provide labor, which was assigned according to the neighborhood, averaging three workdays per person. Even Su Jianfu, a seventy-year-old man, was assigned three workdays. He also mobilized twenty-five carts to haul stones. After the well was completed, it cost a total of 800,000 yuan in loans. All the villagers and village cadres were dissatisfied with this matter. In order to prevent such unnecessary losses from happening again, we hope that the Shouyang County People's Government will pay attention to inspection and correction. We also hope that all localities will pay attention to correcting the phenomenon of forcing the masses to dig wells without investigation and research.

### 山西寿阳县五区七里河村  打一眼井浪费五百个工

    山西寿阳县五区七里河村
    打一眼井浪费五百个工
    编辑同志：山西寿阳县五区七里河村群众在今春抗旱防旱运动中，打了一眼井，浪费了五百个工。这眼井的水面离地面只有五尺深，但井筒挖了二丈五尺深。结果井筒里满都是水，需要把水掏出才能砌砖。非常不巧，下了一天雨，井筒就涨塌了。人们也不研究如何补救，就又在原地方重新打下去。本来这口井只用一百二十五个工便能打成，结果却化了六百二十五个工。
    这个损失，是县人民政府民政科派到这乡工作的一个科员造成的。这个同志工作不深入，没有把打井防旱的道理给群众讲通，就用行政命令的办法强迫群众打井。打井前又没有进行周密的计划，准备工作也没有做好，以致造成损失。这回打井，按道理应由十四家受益户出工，可是这十四家不愿意打井。那个科员就和村干部商议，叫全村群众都出工，按闾分派，平均每人派三工，连七十岁的老汉苏建富也派了三工；还动员了二十五辆大车拉石头。井打成以后，共化费贷款八十万元。全村群众和村干部对这件事都不满意。为了使工作不再受这种不应有的损失，我们除希望寿阳县人民政府注意检查纠正外，还希望各地注意纠正这种不作调查研究，强迫群众打井的现象。 崔均田刘培健
