    New Records on the Production Increase Front
    Bricklaying Workers at Jiulonggang Coal Mine Continuously Set New Records
    Workers from the Capital Construction Engineering Team of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine, Huainan Mining Bureau, have continuously set new bricklaying records for the construction of the No. 9 Mine. The workers closely combined with technicians in production, improved the previous single-line work method of being unable to lay bricks while drilling a well and being unable to drill a well while laying bricks; learned from Soviet experience, and implemented an advanced work method of simultaneous drilling and bricklaying, greatly improving bricklaying efficiency. Wang Kaicheng, a newly promoted group leader, changed the previous method of hanging a center line to hanging an edge line, allowing work to continue uninterrupted while hanging the line. The mine has also made improvements in labor organization and material storage and use, and has established various necessary systems. Since March, workers have continuously set new records. On April 12, they set a national record of bricklaying six point one meters in one day. (Xie Nan, Gao Mingge)
    Tangshan Power Plant Employees Set New Record for Shortening Overhaul Time of Generators and Boilers
    Employees of the Tangshan Power Plant, using the Soviet rapid overhaul method, set a new record for shortening the overhaul time of generators and boilers. Employees of the Tangshan Power Plant began overhauling a certain generator and boiler on May 26. Due to the full utilization of the three major characteristics of the Soviet rapid overhaul method: making good preparations, rational organization, and the use of labor power, replacing human power with mechanical power as much as possible, they completed the overhaul task nine days and nine hours ahead of schedule, saving the country ten billion yuan in value. (Shi Lianying, Wang Shuzeng, Wang Dingjiang)
    The Second Power Plant of Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's Turbine Workshop Sets New Record of 1,130 Days of Safe Operation
    Employees of the turbine workshop of the Second Power Plant of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau have set a new record of 1,130 days of safe operation. The main reason is that they have created many excellent systems to ensure safe operation. They have established a handover system, a cyclical inspection system, a periodic general survey system, a dedicated responsibility system, and a "four diligences" system of diligently asking, diligently watching, diligently touching, and diligently listening. (Wang Zhexian)
    Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Sets New Record of 500 Kilometers for the Entire Depot
    In May of this year, all the locomotives used by the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot averaged 501.8 kilometers per day. Some locomotives implemented overloading on slopes. In the movement of full loading, overloading, and 500 kilometers, leading cadres personally guided the work of the drivers, supporting the drivers in hauling 2,347 tons of goods (the standard is 1,335 tons) on a 9‰ gradient slope, breaking the conservative thinking that "overloading is not possible on slopes." Under the personal supervision of leading cadres, the dispatching office carefully made plans and strengthened the joint labor organization, shortening the locomotive dwell time, thus creating a new record of 500 kilometers. (Lan Ying, Zhu Liang)
    Xinxiang Locomotive Depot Continuously Sets New Overloading Records
    In the movement of full loading, overloading, and 500 kilometers, the Zhengzhou Railway Sub-bureau continuously set new overloading records. The Xinxiang Locomotive Depot's ㄇㄎ63351 locomotive team hauled 4,195 tons between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang on May 29, overloading 2,495 tons, creating the highest record of the Zhengzhou Railway Sub-bureau. Then, Li Yinhuai, the driver of the depot's ㄇㄎ63318 locomotive, took the initiative to request to pull more cars, and on June 1, hauled 5,433 tons, overloading 3,733 tons, setting another new overloading record for the Zhengzhou Railway Sub-bureau.

    Northeast Baichengzi Locomotive Depot Continuously Sets New Records
    The Northeast Baichengzi Locomotive Depot has continuously set new records for overloading and 500 kilometers in the movement of full loading, overloading, and 500 kilometers. The ㄇㄎ—1211 locomotive team traveled 500 kilometers every day for 36 days; the ㄇㄎ—1200 locomotive team also traveled 500 kilometers every day for 31 days and overloaded 8.25 million ton-kilometers. On May 14, the ㄇㄎ—200 locomotive team hauled 4,049 tons, overloading 2,049 tons. The reason why the Baichengzi Locomotive Depot can continuously set new records is that the crew members earnestly studied Zheng Xikun's overloading and 500-kilometer operation method, took the initiative to contact relevant departments, established a joint labor organization, and broke the past phenomenon of non-cooperation between departments. (Li Shaoxian)
    Employees of the Public-Operated Xinji Zhenxing Flour Mill Set New Record for Reducing Raw Material Consumption
    Employees of the Public-Operated Xinji Zhenxing Flour Mill in Lantian County, Hunan Province, have set a new record for reducing raw material consumption. In the past, each bag of flour required 77.32 catties of wheat, and at the highest, 84 catties of wheat were used. Now, it has been reduced to only 60.5 catties of wheat per bag of flour, and the flour yield exceeds the prescribed standard by 3.8%. (Liu Jingyu)

    在增产战线上的新纪录
    九龙岗煤矿砌井工人连续创造新纪录
    淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿基本建设工程队建设九号矿井的工人连续创造了砌井新纪录。工人们在生产中和技术人员密切结合，改进了过去凿井不能砌井，砌井不能凿井的单行工作方法；学习苏联经验，实行了边凿、边砌的先进工作方法，大大地提高了砌井效率。新提拔的大组长王开成，把过去挂中线改成挂边线，挂线时工作可以不停。该矿井在劳动组织和材料保管使用方面，都有了改进，并且建立了各种必要的制度。三月份以后，工人就连续创造新纪录。四月十二日他们创造了一天砌井六点一公尺的全国最高纪录。  （谢南、高明格）
    唐山发电厂职工创缩短检修机电炉时间新纪录
    唐山发电厂职工采用苏联快速检修法，创缩短检修机电炉时间的新纪录。唐山发电厂职工，五月二十六日开始检修某号机电炉，由于职工们充分运用了苏联快速检修法中的三大特点：作好准备工作，合理组织，运用劳动力，尽可能用机械力代替人力，提前九天零九小时完成检修任务，为国家节省十亿元的价值。（史连楹、王树增、王定江）
    天津电业局第二发电厂汽机车间创安全运行一千一百三十天的新纪录
    天津电业局第二发电厂汽机车间职工，创安全运行一千一百三十天的新纪录。主要原因是：他们创造了许多保证安全运行的优良制度。他们建立了交接班制，循回检查制；定期普查制、专责制和勤问、勤看、勤摸、勤听的四勤制。  （王哲贤）
    张家口机务段创造全段五百公里新纪录
    今年五月，张家口机务段全段所有运用的机车平均每天行驶了五百零一点八公里，有些机车在坡上实行了超轴。在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，领导干部亲自指导司机工作，支持司机在千分之九的坡道上牵引二千三百四十七吨（标准是一千三百三十五吨）的货物，打破了“坡道上不能超轴”的保守主义思想。在领导干部亲自督促下，调度所认真地做好计划，加强了联合劳动组织，缩短了机车停留时间，因而创造了五百公里的新纪录。
