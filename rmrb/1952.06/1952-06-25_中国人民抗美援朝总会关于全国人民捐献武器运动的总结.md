To all patriotic men and women of all circles across the country:

The movement to donate weapons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, initiated by this committee on June 1st of last year, has victoriously concluded after a year of joint efforts by patriotic men and women of all circles across the country, greatly exceeding the original plan. As of the end of May this year, the weapon donations remitted to this committee by the People's Banks of all provinces and cities across the country totaled RMB 5,565,062,306,834. Calculated at RMB 1.5 billion per fighter plane, this is equivalent to 3,710 aircraft, with a remaining RMB 62,306,834. The aforementioned donations have been remitted by this committee in batches and fully received by the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteers for the purpose of purchasing aircraft and other weapons.

The tremendous achievements of this patriotic donation movement have greatly strengthened the power of the Chinese People's Volunteers, enabling them to more effectively strike at the American aggressors. Over the past year, with the unfolding of the national people's weapon donation movement, the Chinese People's Volunteers have established an increasingly powerful air force and strengthened their firepower. As a result, the balance of military strength on the Korean battlefield has undergone tremendous changes that are even more favorable to our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. If it was said that a year ago our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army faced difficulties in striking the enemy due to a lack of aircraft, artillery, and other weapons, then the situation is now very different. Our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have greatly strengthened, even in terms of air force and artillery, and have full confidence in crushing the enemy's renewed offensive. This means that our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have further deprived the enemy of the ability to launch a renewed offensive, thereby further guaranteeing the final victory of our anti-aggression struggle.

This patriotic donation movement has once again vividly demonstrated that our great Chinese people, together with the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world, cannot be defeated by any aggressor. It has once again vividly demonstrated the enormous power of the unity and common action of 475 million people.

The reason why this patriotic donation movement was able to quickly achieve such great success is due to the high degree of patriotism and internationalism displayed by men and women compatriots from all walks of life across the country, and due to the correct policy of combining the weapon donation movement with the movement to increase production and increase income, and with in-depth patriotic self-education. Thanks to the unfolding of the movement to increase production and increase income, the weapon donation movement not only did not affect the country's construction and the people's lives, but on the contrary, strengthened the country's construction and improved the people's lives. By adhering to the principle that donations must be based on conscious voluntariness, and by adhering to the method of combining donations with the patriotic public agreement movement, the weapon donation movement has further enhanced the patriotic consciousness and production enthusiasm of the people across the country, and greatly strengthened the unity of the people across the country and internationalist education. Workers, farmers, intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, and people from all walks of life across the country have all contributed their strength in this donation movement to support the sacred cause of resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending their homes and country, fully demonstrating the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism. This committee expresses its deep gratitude and high respect to patriotic men and women compatriots from all circles across the country.

In accordance with the provision in this committee's December 27th "Notice on Carrying Out the Work of Concluding the Weapon Donation Movement" that "the General Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea announces the total amount of donations in major administrative regions, provinces, and major cities," the situation of the national people's weapon donation is hereby officially announced as follows:

    中国人民抗美援朝总会关于全国人民捐献武器运动的总结全国各界男女爱国同胞们：
    本会于去年六月一日发起的捐献武器支援中国人民志愿军的运动，经过一年来全国各界男女爱国同胞的共同努力，现在已经大大超过原定计划地胜利结束了。到今年五月底为止，由全国各省市人民银行汇解本会的武器捐款，共达人民币五万五千六百五十亿六千二百三十万六千八百三十四元，以每架战斗机值十五亿元计算，可折合三千七百一十架飞机，尚余人民币六千二百三十万六千八百三十四元。上述捐款业经本会分批悉数解交中国人民志愿军领导机关收讫，作为购置飞机等武器之用。
    这次爱国捐献运动所获得的巨大成就，已经极大地加强了中国人民志愿军的威力，使他们能够更有效地打击美国侵略者。过去一年来，随着全国人民捐献武器运动的展开，中国人民志愿军已经建立起一支实力日益强大的空军并且加强了自己的火力。其结果是朝鲜战场双方军事实力的对比，已经发生了更加有利于我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军方面的巨大变化。如果说，一年以前我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在打击敌人方面的困难，是飞机、大炮等武器不够多的话，那么，现在的情况已经大不相同了。我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，即使是在空军及炮兵方面，也大大加强了，有充分把握来粉碎敌人的重新进攻了。这就是说，我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，已经进一步地剥夺了敌人重新进攻的能力，因而就进一步地保证了我们的反侵略斗争的最后胜利。
    这次爱国捐献运动，又一次地生动地证明：我们伟大的中国人民和朝鲜人民及全世界爱好和平人民在一起，是任何侵略者所不能战胜的。这又一次地生动地证明：四亿七千五百万人民的团结一致和共同行动，具有多么巨大的威力。
    这次爱国捐献运动所以能够迅速地取得巨大的成就，是由于全国各界男女同胞，发挥了高度的爱国主义和国际主义的热忱，是由于全国人民执行了捐献武器运动和增加生产、增加收入的运动相结合，并与深入爱国主义的自我教育相结合的正确方针。由于增加生产、增加收入运动的展开，这次捐献武器运动的进行，不但没有影响国家的建设和人民的生活，而且相反地加强了国家的建设和改善了人民的生活。由于坚持了捐献必须根据自觉自愿的原则，坚持了捐献与爱国公约运动结合进行的办法，这次捐献运动的进行，已经进一步地提高了全国人民的爱国觉悟和生产积极性，并且大大地加强了全国人民的团结和国际主义教育。全国的工人、农民、知识分子、工商业家和其他各界人民，在这次捐献运动中，都争先恐后地贡献自己的力量，来支持抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣事业，充分地表现了爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神。本会谨向全国各界男女爱国同胞致以深切的感谢和崇高的敬意。
