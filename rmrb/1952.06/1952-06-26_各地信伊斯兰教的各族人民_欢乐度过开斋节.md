Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, June 25th: The "Eid al-Fitr" (Note: "Eid al-Fitr" is the day of breaking the fast after the end of the fasting month, also known as the Little New Year, but the dates of "Eid al-Fitr" for people of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam are not the same) of the Uighur, Hui, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Uzbek, Tatar, and Tajik ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province who believe in Islam was joyfully celebrated by the religious people of all ethnic groups in Dihua.

In order to enable all religious people of all ethnic groups to celebrate the festival happily, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government specially issued a notice before the festival to factories, enterprises, institutions, organizations, and schools in Xinjiang Province and Dihua City to give employees, staff, and students of all ethnic groups a day off. On this day, state-owned stores in Dihua City offered discounted prices for the purchase of goods by people of all ethnic groups. On the streets of Dihua, people of all ethnic groups wearing festive clothes could be seen greeting each other for the New Year. In the shade of the trees in the park, people played the "Rewap" (stringed instrument), sang and danced. All forty-six Islamic temples in the city held celebrations, the important content of which was propaganda about increasing production and practicing economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 25th: Muslims in Linxia, Pingliang, and other areas in Gansu Province where ethnic minorities who believe in Islam live in concentrated communities, celebrated "Eid al-Fitr." On this day, state-owned companies reduced the prices of large quantities of goods, especially necessities for the festival such as flour, oil, and sugar. The people of all ethnic minorities were very grateful for this care from the state. They unanimously believed that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, necessities for Muslims to celebrate the festival were hoarded, and it was impossible to buy things to eat without spending a lot of money; today, Muslims can buy large quantities of cheap necessities, which only the People's Government would do. Muslim cadres working in government agencies also received gifts from the People's Government. One Muslim cadre said with emotion: "Before liberation, we were discriminated against everywhere; today, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, we are not only equal to all ethnic groups, but also receive preferential treatment everywhere." The people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam enthusiastically celebrated this festival. Nearly 20,000 people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam in the urban and suburban areas of Linxia City held a grand "Eid al-Fitr" gathering on the morning of the 23rd. The masses who participated in the gathering were jubilant and extremely excited. The Hui people in Pingliang City, the imams of the mosques, and people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam from other places also held warm celebrations.

    各地信伊斯兰教的各族人民
    欢乐度过开斋节
    【新华社迪化二十五日电】二十四日是新疆省维吾尔、回、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、乌兹别克、塔塔尔、塔吉克等信仰伊斯兰教的兄弟民族的“开斋节”（按：“开斋节”即封斋月期满后开斋的日子，又称过小年，但各地信奉伊斯兰教的各族人民的“开斋节”日期并不是一致的）。迪化各族信仰伊斯兰教的教民欢乐地度过了这一节日。
    为了使所有信教的各族人民都能欢度节日，新疆省人民政府特地在节日前通令新疆省和迪化市的各工厂企业、机关、团体、学校对各兄弟民族的职工、工作人员、学员放假一天。在这一天，迪化市国营商店对各兄弟民族人民购买物品实行减价优待。迪化街头到处可以看到穿着节日衣服的各族人民互相拜年。在公园的林荫下，人们弹着“热瓦甫”
    （弦乐器）歌唱跳舞。全市四十六个伊斯兰教寺坊都举行了庆祝会，庆祝会的重要内容是关于增产节约的宣传。
    【新华社兰州二十五日电】甘肃省信仰伊斯兰教的民族聚居地临夏、平凉等地的伊斯兰教徒欢度了
    “开斋节”。这一天，各国营公司减价出售大量物品，特别是过节必需品如面粉、油类、糖类等。各少数民族人民对于国家对他们的这种照顾非常感激，他们一致认为，在国民党反动统治时期，伊斯兰教教徒过节时生活必需品都被囤积起来，不花大价钱就买不到东西吃；今天，伊斯兰教教徒买到大批廉价必需品，这只有人民政府才会这样。机关工作的伊斯兰教民族干部，并得到人民政府赠送的礼品，一位伊斯兰教民族干部感动地说：“解放前我们处处受到歧视；今天，在毛主席的正确领导下，我们不但和各兄弟民族一律平等了，而且还处处受到优待。”伊斯兰教的各族人民都热烈地庆祝这一节日。临夏市城区和郊区近两万信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民于二十三日上午举行了盛大的“开斋节”聚会，参加聚会的群众欢腾鼓舞，兴奋异常。平凉市的回民群众、寺坊阿訇以及其他各地信奉伊斯兰教的各族人民也都举行了热烈的庆祝。
