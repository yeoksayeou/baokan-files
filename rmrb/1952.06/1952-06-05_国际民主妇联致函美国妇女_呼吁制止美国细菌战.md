Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 4th: The Women's International Democratic Federation has issued an "Open Letter to American Women" on the occasion of the second anniversary of the U.S. launching its war of aggression against Korea, stating: American women and mothers! Irrefutable facts prove that the U.S. military, under the guise of the United Nations flag, is deliberately conducting germ warfare among the people of China and Korea, an escalation of the nearly two-year-long destructive war. The U.S. government is painstakingly preventing you from knowing the truth about these crimes because they are well aware that once the people understand the truth, they will unite to stop this shameful behavior.

The letter continues: A vigorous and massive movement has unfolded around the world, expressing unanimous indignation and hatred towards those responsible for the germ warfare crimes. After citing many specific pieces of evidence of U.S. germ warfare, the letter states: In the past, many people initially did not believe the accounts of the atrocities of the Hitler gang. Even a year ago, many of us were unaware of the atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Korea, unaware of their mass slaughter of women and children, of burning civilians alive, and of the use of napalm bombs, unaware of the things described in the report of the "International Women's Investigation Team on Atrocities of the U.S. and Rhee Armies in Korea." Do not let those who commit these acts deceive you and keep you from knowing the truth. Do not let the Pentagon turn your children, your husbands, into beasts, into weapons for conducting germ warfare that inspires deep-seated hatred. Now, Korean women are suffering unspeakable disasters. They are fighting against diseases caused by germs. But the plague knows no boundaries. Your children, your husbands, and, through their contagion, even the American people, are in danger of contracting the plague.

The letter concludes: Take immediate action to stop germ warfare! We call on you: Demand that the Washington government sign, ratify, and abide by the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, which prohibits the use of poisonous and bacteriological weapons and has been signed by all major countries except the U.S. and Japan. You, the women of America, have a special task: to force your government to stop germ warfare, withdraw U.S. troops from Korea, and let the Korean people decide their own destiny.

    国际民主妇联致函美国妇女
    呼吁制止美国细菌战
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：国际民主妇女联合会在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争行将满二年之际，特发表“致美国妇女的公开信”说：美国的妇女和母亲们！无可争辩的种种事实证明，在联合国旗帜掩饰下的侵朝美军蓄意在中朝两国人民中间进行细菌战，这是将近两年的毁灭性战争的扩大。美国政府处心积虑地不让你们知道罪行的真实情况，因为它们十分清楚，一旦人民明白真实情况，他们就要团结起来一致制止这种可耻行为。
    该信又说：世界各地蓬勃地展开了声势浩大的运动，对于细菌战罪行负责的人一致表示愤慨与憎恨。该信在引述了美国进行细菌战的许多具体证据以后说：从前也有许多人起初不相信关于希特勒匪帮的种种兽行的话。就是在一年以前，我们有很多人还不知道美军在朝鲜的暴行，不知道他们大批屠杀妇女儿童，把老百姓活活烧死以及使用凝固汽油弹的事情，还不知道“国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团”的报告中所说的事情。不要让干这些勾当的人蒙蔽你们使你们不知道真实情况。不要让国防部把你们的孩子、你们的丈夫变成野兽，变成进行令人恨入骨髓的细菌战的武器。现在朝鲜妇女遭受着不可言状的灾难。她们正在和细菌所引起的疾病搏斗着。但是瘟疫是不知道界线的。你们的孩子，你们的丈夫，而且经过他们的传染，以至美国的人民，都有染上瘟疫的危险。
    该信最后说：立即行动起来制止细菌战吧！我们向你们呼吁：要求华盛顿政府签署、批准并遵守一九二五年六月十七日缔订的除美日两国外一切大国均已签署的禁止使用毒物与细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。你们，美国的妇女，有着特殊的任务，就是：迫使你们政府停止细菌战，把美军撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己决定他们的命运。
