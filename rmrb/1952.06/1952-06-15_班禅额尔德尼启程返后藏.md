During the farewell ceremony, Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, delivered a farewell speech. He emphasized: "The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni have been closely united. In the future, we should strengthen the unity within the Tibetan ethnic group, strengthen the unity between people of all circles in Tibet and the troops of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and all staff, overcome various difficulties in the construction of Tibet, and faithfully implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, so as to achieve the goal of building a new Tibet and building a great motherland." General Zhang Guohua, commander of the Tibet Military Region, said: "The troops of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet will further unite and cooperate with all the monks and laypeople under the leadership of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and strive to implement the agreement, build a new Tibet, and consolidate national defense." In his reply, Panchen Erdeni thanked Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and the heads of the Tibet Military Region for their care and help. Then, he said: "We must further strengthen unity, resolutely implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and always under the wise leadership of the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese Communist Party, do our best to complete the glorious task of building a new Tibet and consolidating the national defense."
