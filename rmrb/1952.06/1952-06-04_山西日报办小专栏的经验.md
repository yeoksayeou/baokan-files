Shanxi Daily's small columns are well-received by the masses and have strengthened the connection between the newspaper and the people. Before September of last year, the newspaper had three small columns: agricultural technology, reading the newspaper and communication, and a propagandist training station. Later, it added small columns such as worker and staff life, worker-peasant discussion forums, where society is heading, mutual aid and cooperation, a cultural learning transmission station, and talks on the Marriage Law. The characteristics of these small columns are: clear target audience, accessible and systematic content, and fixed format. Therefore, they changed the shortcomings of the newspaper being "four large pages, one big block, unclear layout," and enriched the ideological content of the newspaper. Here are the main experiences of Shanxi Daily in running small columns:

Running small columns is a good way to enrich the ideological content of the newspaper

The various small columns of Shanxi Daily are powerful tools for conducting ideological education in close connection with the central tasks. The main content of the "Propagandist Training Station" is to explain current political issues and various central tasks, and to provide propagandists with timely propaganda materials; "Worker and Staff Life" is specifically for ideological education of the workers; "Worker-Peasant Discussion Forums" is for ideological education of workers and peasants on the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance; "Mutual Aid and Cooperation" is for educating farmers on organizing themselves; "Where Society is Heading" is to educate the broad masses of people on historical materialism and the socialist future in a popular form. These small columns have already had a significant impact on the masses. For example, the "Worker-Peasant Discussion Forums" column has effectively conducted ideological education on the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural mutual assistance for workers and peasants. Therefore, when rural cadres and farmer representatives from across the province visited various factories in Taiyuan last November, workers and peasants said as soon as they met: "Although we haven't met in person, we have met in the 'Discussion Forums'." The Party's idea of the "worker-peasant alliance" has deeply penetrated their hearts. Cadres said: In the "Worker-Peasant Discussion Forums," we saw many moving facts and received concrete education on the "worker-peasant alliance." The "Worker and Staff Life" column has not only established prestige among workers, but even members of the reading groups in Zuoquan Chengguan and other places love to read it. From it, they learned about the production and life of workers and gained a clearer understanding of the leading role of the working class.

These facts show that as long as the newspaper truly and deeply reflects the thoughts of the working people, not only workers and peasants love to read it, but also cadres love to read it. Therefore, the idea of mechanically dividing provincial newspapers into cadre newspapers and mass newspapers is incorrect. Of course, it is also wrong to turn small columns into an accumulation of trivial daily matters and use low-level interests to cater to the backward consciousness of a small number of people. This is understanding popularization as vulgarization, which is a characteristic of the "supplements" of bourgeois newspapers. Our small columns should use lively and popular forms to reflect the lives of the people and conduct ideological education, guiding the thoughts of the people to the healthy and correct path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental way for the people's newspapers to fulfill their tasks of ideological struggle.

Running small columns has paved the way for the popularization of newspapers

At the beginning of September last year, when Shanxi Daily began to reform its popularization, it emphasized that the first step was to popularize the small columns. Now it seems that the various small columns have largely achieved this requirement, especially the "Worker and Staff Life" column. The "Where Society is Heading" column, which can write theoretical articles on the path of social development in popular language, is also very good. The specific experience of running "Worker and Staff Life" is: First, use the method of good-bad comparison and the form of ideological discussion as much as possible (ideological discussion is the commentary of "Worker and Staff Life") to combine popular forms with higher ideological content. Second, use the actions of advanced elements to criticize the behavior of backward elements, and use the thoughts and language of the workers themselves to educate the workers themselves. This method of using living facts and living teaching materials for education is easily accepted by the workers.

The common features of all the small columns are: simple language, short length, writing about living people, living events, and living principles, and publishing illustrations and photographs as much as possible. In the twenty-three issues of "Worker and Staff Life" from the beginning of September to the end of October last year, a total of 109 articles were published, the vast majority of which were between 300 and 500 words. All small columns are printed in old No. 5 font, and some are printed in No. 4 font. The general feedback is: "The characters are big and the text is short, which saves effort when reading and sounds pleasant to the ear," "It speaks the language of workers and peasants, which sounds tasteful and satisfying." In the past, some comrades believed that short texts can only achieve popularization and cannot write out things with ideological content. Facts have proved that this statement is wrong.

Because Shanxi Daily started popularization from small columns, the newspaper has changed its face, and now news and commentaries are also gradually beginning to be popularized.

The method of running small columns is to rely on the masses and run them for the masses

Many of Shanxi Daily's small columns were requested by the masses when the newspaper sent people to the countryside and factories in June last year to solicit readers' opinions. Therefore, it is based on the urgent demands of the broad masses. Therefore, after the appearance of the small columns, they were immediately welcomed by the masses. In just two months, there were 173 letters from readers expressing their welcome to the small columns. The editors deeply felt: After running the newspaper for so many years, they had never received so many letters specifically praising the newspaper in such a short period of time, so they were very excited.

The success of running small columns should first be attributed to the masses. The masses not only provided opinions on what to run and how to run it, but also gave the newspaper staff encouragement and timely provided suggestions for improvement in the process of running it. The "Worker-Peasant Discussion Forums" was inspired by the fact that workers and peasants were already in very close contact with each other; "Where Society is Heading" was also set up at the repeated request of the masses. If we deviate from the requirements and wisdom of the masses, we will accomplish nothing. This profoundly educated the editorial staff: we must adopt the principle of running a newspaper that believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and follows the mass line in order to run the newspaper well.

Because the mass line of relying on the masses to run the newspaper and running it for the masses was adopted, the newspaper cultivated a group of worker-peasant correspondents and newspaper readers, and discovered many excellent worker-peasant works. Taking the industrial group as an example, before the "Worker and Staff Life" column was established, an average of more than 400 articles were received each month (only more than 10 articles from workers), and more than 60 articles were adopted, of which only three or four were from workers. After the "Worker and Staff Life" column was established in September last year, the number of articles received that month increased to 632, of which 371 were from workers; a total of 54 articles were adopted, of which 31 were from workers.

Because the appearance of small columns such as "Worker and Staff Life" and "Worker-Peasant Discussion Forums" in the newspaper, not only the number of articles from workers increased, but also workers loved to read Shanxi Daily more and more. They wrote articles, subscribed to newspapers, and read newspapers, and deeply felt the party's ideological education in their daily lives, thus deepening their feelings for the newspaper. The enthusiasm of the masses has also strengthened the mass viewpoint of the editorial staff. Therefore, the erroneous view that "worker-peasant correspondents are good, but the articles they write cannot be used" has begun to be eliminated. This proves that it is not that the workers and peasants cannot write articles, but that many editors have a purely technical point of view or lack a mass viewpoint, which blocks the voices of the broad masses of workers and peasants. At the same time, it proves that worker-peasant correspondents and newspaper reading work can be carried out, and must be carried out, because only when the newspaper is full of the voices of the masses can the newspaper have endless vitality and combat effectiveness.

In order to promote the mass line of relying on the masses to run the newspaper and running it for the masses, the editorial staff of the "Worker and Staff Life" column of Shanxi Daily adopted the following methods: First, hold small-scale seminars for worker reading groups. In this meeting, they learned about the thoughts and problems of the workers, listened to the requirements and opinions of the workers, and knew what to do when writing the manuscript. Second, go to the factory to listen to the reading group read the newspaper. This is the best way to check whether your "finished product" is qualified. Third, go to the scene to deeply understand the situation. Combining this with small seminars can help you understand the situation more. The "typical" materials learned at the meeting can become clues for on-site interviews.

Prevent complacency, overcome shortcomings, and continue to move forward

The achievements and experiences that Shanxi Daily has already made are indeed valuable; but this is just the beginning, and we need to continue to create and improve. At the same time, the newspaper is not without shortcomings in running small columns. On the contrary, there are still some more serious shortcomings: First, it has not been able to conduct ideological education and ideological struggle in a planned and step-by-step manner, so the content of the small columns appears to be disorganized, which hinders the improvement of ideology. Second, some articles are too long, the language is not popular, and there are few pictures and photos. Third, the development of various small columns is unbalanced, such as "Reading the Newspaper and Communication" which is very poorly run. Fourth, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is not strong. These shortcomings need to be overcome continuously, and there should be no complacency. In the past, the newspaper had run some good small columns, but they died prematurely due to complacency. This lesson must be deeply remembered.

    山西日报办小专栏的经验
    山西日报所办的小专栏，为群众喜闻乐见，密切了报纸和群众的联系。该报在去年九月以前就设有农业技术、读报和通讯、宣传员传授站等三种小专栏。以后，又陆续增设了职工生活、工人农民谈话所、社会往那里走、互助合作、学习文化传授站、婚姻法讲话等小专栏。这些小专栏的特点是：对象明确，内容通俗、系统，形式固定。因此，改变了报纸“四大版，一大片，眉目不清”的缺点，丰富了报纸的思想内容。现将山西日报办小专栏的几点主要经验介绍于后：
    办小专栏是丰富报纸思想内容的好方法
    山西日报的各个小专栏，是紧密结合中心工作进行思想教育的有力工具。“宣传员传授站”的主要内容，是讲解时事政治问题和各种中心工作的问题，及时供给宣传员以宣传资料；“职工生活”是专对工人群众进行思想教育的；“工人农民谈话所”是对工人、农民群众进行工农联盟、城乡互助的思想教育的；“互助合作”是对农民进行组织起来的教育的；“社会往那里走”是用通俗的形式，向广大人民进行历史唯物论和社会主义前途的教育的。这些小专栏已经在群众中发生了很大的作用。例如“工人农民谈话所”栏就有效地向工人农民进行了工农联盟、城乡互助的思想教育。因而在去年十一月全省农村干部、农民代表到太原参观各工厂时，工人农民一见面就说：“咱们虽然没见过面，可是在‘谈话所’里见过面。”党的“工农联盟”的思想已经深入到他们的心里。干部们说：我们在“工人农民谈话所”里，看到了许多的动人事实，受到了具体的“工农联盟”的教育。“职工生活”栏，不仅在工人中建立了威信，就连左权城关等地农民读报组的组员也很爱看它。他们从中了解了工人的生产、生活情况，更清楚地认识了工人阶级的领导作用。
    这些事实表明，报纸只要真实地深刻地反映了劳动人民群众的思想，不仅工农爱看，干部也爱看。所以，那种把省级报纸机械地分为干部报和群众报的思想是不对的。当然，如果把小专栏变成日常琐事的堆积，用低级趣味去迎合小部分人的落后意识，也是错误的。这是把通俗化理解成庸俗化了，这是资产阶级报纸“副刊”的特点。我们的小专栏应该用活泼通俗的形式去反映人民群众的生活，进行思想教育，把人民群众的思想引导到健康、正确的——马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的道路上，这才是人民的报纸实现其思想斗争任务的根本道路。
    办小专栏给报纸通俗化开辟了道路
    去年九月初，山西日报开始进行通俗化改革时，就强调指出：首先要使小专栏通俗化。现在看来，各个小专栏已经大体达到了这个要求，其中尤以 “职工生活”栏办得最好。“社会往那里走”这一栏，能够用通俗的语言写出社会发展道路的理论性的文章来，也是很好的。办“职工生活”的具体经验是：一、要多多采用好坏对比的方法，和思想漫谈的形式（思想漫谈是“职工生活”的评论），使通俗的形式和内容较高的思想结合起来。二、要用先进分子的行动批评落后分子的行为，用工人群众自己的思想语言教育工人群众自己。这种用活事活教材进行教育的方法，容易被工人群众所接受。
    各个小专栏的共同特点是：语言通俗，篇幅短小，都是写活人活事活道理，并尽可能地刊登了插图和照片。“职工生活”从去年九月初到十月底的二十三期中，共发稿一百零九件，其中三百字到五百字的稿子占绝大多数。所有小专栏，都是用老五号字排，有的还用四号字排。一般的反映是：“字大文短，读着省劲，听着顺耳”，“说的是工人农民的话，听着合味过瘾”。过去有些同志认为，文字短了只能作到通俗化，不能写出有思想内容的东西，事实证明这种说法是错误的。
    山西日报由于首先从小专栏着手通俗化，使报纸改变了面貌，现在新闻、评论也逐渐开始通俗化了。
    办小专栏的方法是依靠群众办、给群众办
    山西日报的小专栏，很多都是该报去年六月间派人下乡下厂征求读者意见时，群众提出来叫办的。因此它是建立在广大群众迫切要求的基础之上的。所以各小专栏出现后，立即受到了群众的欢迎。仅在两个月内就有一百七十三封读者来信，表示欢迎小专栏。编辑同志深深感到：办报许多年，从来也没有在这样短的时间中收到过这样多的专门赞扬报纸的信件，因而十分兴奋。
    办小专栏的成绩，应首先归功于群众。群众不仅提供了办什么、怎样办的意见，并且在办的过程中又给了报纸工作人员以鼓励，及时提供了改进意见。“工人农民谈话所”就是在工人农民已经相互来往非常密切的情况下，才给了编辑以启发，办了这个小专栏；“社会往那里走”也是在群众一再要求下办起来的。如果离开群众的要求、智慧，就会一事无成。这就深刻地教育了编辑工作人员：必须采取相信群众、依靠群众、走群众路线的办报方针，才能把报纸办好。
    由于采取了依靠群众办、给群众办的群众路线的作法，该报培养了一批工农通讯员和读报员，并发现了许多优秀的工农作品。以工业组为例，在未办“职工生活”栏以前，每月平均来稿四百多件（工人来稿只十多件），采用六十多件，其中采用工人来稿只三、四件。去年九月份办了“职工生活”栏以后，当月来稿增加到六百三十二件，其中工人来稿占三百七十一件；共采用稿五十四件，其中采用工人的就有三十一件。
    因为“职工生活”和“工人农民谈话所”等小专栏在报纸上的出现，不仅工人群众来稿增加，而且工人愈爱看山西日报了。他们写稿、订报、读报，在日常生活中深深感受到党的思想教育，因而加深了和报纸的感情。群众的这种热情也加强了编辑工作人员的群众观念。因此，“工农通讯员好是好，就是写来稿子不能用”的错误看法，已开始消除了。这证明不是工农群众写不了稿子，而是因为不少编辑工作人员存在着单纯技术观点或缺乏群众观点，以致堵塞了广大工农群众的声音。同时证明工农通讯员和读报工作是能够开展的，而且是必须开展的，因为只有报纸充满了群众的声音，才能使报纸具有无穷尽的生命力和战斗力。
    为了发扬依靠群众办报、给群众办报的群众路线的作风，山西日报“职工生活”栏的编辑工作人员，曾采取了这样几个办法：一、召开小型的工人读报组座谈会。在这种会上了解了工人的思想和问题，听了工人的要求和意见，编稿子就心中有数了。二、下厂听读报组读报。这是审查自己“成品”是否合格的最好方式。三、到现场深入了解情况。这点和小型座谈会结合起来，就能够更多地了解情况。会上了解到的“典型”材料，就可成为现场采访的线索。
    防止自满，克服缺点，继续前进
    山西日报已经取得的这些成绩和经验，确是可贵的；但这仅仅是开步走，还需要继续创造和提高。同时，该报在办小专栏方面，也不是毫无缺点。相反的，还存在着一些比较严重的缺点：一、还未能有计划有步骤地进行思想教育和思想斗争，因而显得小专栏内容零乱，阻碍了思想性的提高。二、有的文章过长，语言不通俗，图画照片少。三、各个小专栏的发展不平衡，如“读报与通讯”就办得很不好。四、批评和自我批评的空气不浓。这些缺点都需要继续克服，不能有任何自满的情绪。过去，该报曾经办过一些好的小专栏，但在自满情绪下夭折了。这个教训必须深刻记取。
