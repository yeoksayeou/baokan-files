Introduction to Writing Methods in Accelerated Literacy Teaching
Zhou Bin, compiled

Editor's Note: In the process of popularizing the accelerated literacy method teaching in the Central and Southern Military Region and the Fourth Field Army, Comrade Zhou Bin, a cultural education cadre of a certain unit, and cultural instructors Zeng Duanyi and Tang Bin created a relatively systematic new writing method, which is of great help to solving the difficulties of beginners in writing and rapidly developing writing activities. The experimental effect of this writing method is very good and has been welcomed by the majority of commanders and fighters of the troops. The leaders of the South China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued a commendation order on April 8, awarding each of the three comrades a merit and calling on all military educators to learn from their spirit of creation.

After the accelerated literacy teaching stage is over, writing and composition activities should follow. Writing is the beginning of composition—it is an important part of lower grade teaching and a key to developing "four skills." Therefore, the issue of writing is worth studying carefully by all teachers. Now, the preliminary results of the research of Zeng Duanyi, Tang Bin, and myself are introduced below for everyone to study together and make it a relatively complete method.

I. Characteristics of Chinese Characters

Chinese characters have three major characteristics:

Square characters are different from foreign languages. Each character is unique. At first glance, it seems difficult for beginners to learn the writing of each character. However, although there are many Chinese characters, the strokes that make up these characters are only eight types: dot, horizontal, vertical, left-falling stroke, rising stroke, right-falling stroke, hook, and turning stroke. If you learn these strokes first, writing characters will not seem difficult. This is the first characteristic of square characters.

The second characteristic of square characters is that the radicals and tops of many characters are the same, such as "室, 宣" (shì, xuān - room, declare), which both have the "宀" (mián - roof) radical; "树, 桶" (shù, tǒng - tree, bucket) both have the "木" (mù - wood) radical. If you learn some radicals and tops, and then add other strokes, you will be able to write many characters.

There are also some characters that are made up of several different or identical characters, forming another character, such as "明, 朋" (míng, péng - bright, friend). This is the third characteristic of square characters.

Secondly, for beginners in writing, which characters are difficult to write and which characters are not easy to write?

The students said: "Characters with fewer strokes are easier to write, and characters with more strokes are more difficult to write." This makes sense. This tells us that teaching should grasp the principle of "from simple to complex." However, in actual observation of their writing process, when encountering characters like 之, 心, 弓, 也, 多 (zhī, xīn, gōng, yě, duō - of, heart, bow, also, many), although there are few strokes, they are also awkward to write due to their many turns or diagonal strokes. In addition, they were also seen writing the characters "语" (yǔ - language), "课" (kè - lesson) from the language textbook and "轰" (hōng - to bomb) from bombing. Although there are many strokes, they are not difficult to write because they are composed of several simple characters. Therefore, the difficulty of writing should not be determined by the simplicity or complexity of the strokes, but the teaching method should be mastered "from easy to difficult" in combination with the stroke style and shape of the characters.

II. How to Teach?

Before teaching writing, students must first be taught the essentials of holding a pen. Often, people who start writing do not know how to hold the pen or hold the pen very tightly, fearing that it will run away. In this case, they should be told to hold the lower end of the pen shaft with the tips of the thumb and index finger, with the middle finger supporting it from behind, and the upper end of the pen resting on the intersection of the thumb and index finger. The little finger should not be tightly attached to the paper so that it is flexible to write. Afterwards, proceed in the following steps:

Step 1: Teach Strokes (1 hour).

What are strokes? Simply put, they are: "dot (、), horizontal (一), vertical (丨), left-falling stroke (丿), rising stroke (ノ), right-falling stroke (?), hook (儿), turning stroke (??)" these eight types.

When teaching strokes, write the eight basic strokes on a large piece of paper and paste them on the blackboard like teaching phonetic symbols. In addition to telling the students the name of each stroke, you must also tell the students where to pay attention to the weight, speed. For example, when writing "乚" (yin), slow down at the curved place, and slightly emphasize at the hook, and don't write "乚" as "?".

Step 2: Teach Stroke Order (1 hour).

Although there are many Chinese characters, they have certain rules. There is a certain order of where to start writing, which stroke to write first, and which stroke to write later, which is called stroke order. In summary, there are the following five principles:

(1) From left to right: such as the characters "化, 时, 班" (huà, shí, bān - transform, time, class), all write the left side first and then the right side. But there are also exceptions. For example, "进, 廷" (jìn, tíng - enter, court) etc., write the right side first, and then the left side. Only characters with the "辶" (chuò - walk) or "廴" (yǐn - long stride) shapes are like this, we treat them as special cases.

(2) From top to bottom: such as the characters "空, 是, 重" (kōng, shì, zhòng - empty, is, heavy).

(3) Horizontal before vertical: such as the characters "土, 木, 打" (tǔ, mù, dǎ - earth, wood, hit). If this principle is extended a bit, any character whose starting stroke has a horizontal stroke intersecting with other strokes should write the horizontal stroke first, such as the characters "左, 古" (zuǒ, gǔ - left, ancient).

(4) Left-falling stroke before right-falling stroke: such as the characters "八, 人, 分" (bā, rén, fēn - eight, person, divide).

(5) From outside to inside, enter first, then close the door: such as the characters "囚, 因, 固" (qiú, yīn, gù - prisoner, cause, solid).

Mastering these five principles of writing, no matter what character it is, you will know where to start writing, and you will not write it upside down. However, these five principles are not completely separate when writing, but are closely related to each other. Often, several principles must be used at the same time when writing a character.

When teaching, in addition to telling the students the principles of stroke order, you must also decompose examples to teach them.

Step 3: Teach Radicals and Tops (2 hours).

Radicals and tops were called "部首" (bùshǒu - radicals) in the old saying. It is the main part of the character, and also the beginning of the character. The same radical can form many different characters. Familiarity with commonly used radicals can reduce the difficulty of starting strokes, and it is also very helpful for memorizing characters and distinguishing word meanings. The common ones are the following nineteen types: "亻彳氵冫扌忄刂阝犭牜衤礻?宀艹??广疒". When teaching, first explain the name, and then explain the use with examples. And try to be as vivid as possible. For example, "阝" (fǔ - ear radical) can be said that isn't this like a person's ear? At the same time, it can also be appropriately linked to its position and usage. For example, our ears grow on both sides of the head, so "阝" is always on the side of the character, such as the two characters "部队" (bùduì - troops). After the explanation, ask the students to repeatedly practice these radicals and tops, without having to practice characters, until they are proficient.

Step 4: Teach Character Components (2 hours).

A character component is half of the constituent part of a character, and it is also a complete character in itself. Therefore, for any character composed of a component, its meaning is inseparable from the meaning of the component itself, such as "烧" (shāo - burn), "炒" (chǎo - stir-fry), which are composed of the "火" (huǒ - fire) radical, are always related to fire. When teaching, these principles should be told to the students to increase their interest in learning. In addition, being familiar with the component not only solves half the difficulty in writing, but also gives a deeper understanding of the meaning of the character. The commonly used components are the following twenty-seven types, "木火山土口囗女文方力巾立斤言虫月 (月) 日足石辛金食贝目雨戈门". After teaching, ask the students to practice writing (characters composed of them do not have to be written). After being proficient, it will lay the foundation for writing complex characters.

In addition to formally teaching students in the classroom, the above methods can also be used to arrange the environment and draw strokes, radicals, and components everywhere, so that students have the opportunity to learn anytime and anywhere.

III. How to Teach Students to Practice Writing

After the students have the above writing foundation, they will be further taught to practice writing. At this time, the principles of "from easy to difficult and from simple to complex" should be firmly grasped.

At the same time, in teaching, students should also be told: writing should be upright, and the top, bottom, size, and shape should be evenly matched. Of course, in the beginning, they should not be required too much. It is best to practice writing by using squared paper. When students have a foundation in writing, put forward the standards for writing: first, write correctly; second, write neatly; third, write quickly.

In order to make it easier for students to remember the essentials of writing, we have compiled a clapper talk for the students to read. The students reflect: "This is the easiest to remember." This clapper talk can be used in teaching to make students memorize:

"Learning to write has essentials, understand the basic strokes first.
Learn to write dots, horizontals, verticals, and left-falling strokes, practice rising strokes, right-falling strokes, hooks, and turning strokes carefully,
After familiarizing yourself with radicals and components, keep the principles of stroke order in mind,
Start writing from the left side, remember to go from top to bottom,
Do not mix horizontals and verticals, write verticals straight and horizontals flat,
There are regulations for writing left-falling strokes before right-falling strokes, closing the door after going from outside to inside,
The left and right lengths should be matched, the top and bottom sizes should be even,
Write the characters upright, do not be crooked,
Correct, neat, and up to standard, practice diligently and conscientiously."

IV. A Few Experiences

(1) When the teacher teaches strokes, they must write accurately and formally, without the slightest sloppiness or carelessness. Because students have a strong imitative ability, and the first impression is particularly deep; if it is wrong at the beginning, it will be difficult to change it later.

(2) After teaching a small section, make a test (dictation). The method of testing is to say the names of strokes, radicals, and components, and ask them to write them out. When free, practice "moving home" (applying what has been learned in different contexts) more often.

(3) Expand writing assistance. Otherwise, if one person writes down, many strokes will be written out of shape. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the people who write well in the group to help those who write poorly.

    速成识字教学中的写字方法介绍
    周斌整理
    编者按：在中南军区、第四野战军普遍推行速成识字法教学过程中，某部文化教育干事周斌、文化教员曾端仪、唐斌等三位同志创造出一种较有系统的新写字法，这对解决初学写字者的困难，迅速展开写话活动，有很大帮助。这一写字法的实验效果很好，受到部队广大指战员的欢迎。人民解放军华南军区首长特于四月八日发布嘉奖令，除给三位同志各记功一次外，并号召全军教育工作者学习他们这种创造精神。
    在速成识字教学阶段结束后，接着就要展开写字、写话活动；而写字又是写话的开始——它是低年级教学中的一个重要环节，同时又是向“四会”发展的一个主要关键。因此，关于写字这一问题，是值得我们所有教员很好来研究的。现在，将曾端仪、唐斌以及我的初步研究的结果，介绍在下面，以便大家共同研究，使它成为一个比较完善的方法。
    一、中国字的特点
    中国字有三大特点：
    方块字不同于外国文字，一个字一个样，初学写字的人乍一看起来，似乎要学会每个字的写法很难。但是中国字尽管多，构成这些字的笔划却只有八种——点、横、竖、撇、挑、捺、钩、折。要是把这些笔划先学会了，再写字就不觉得难了。这是方块字的第一个特点。
    方块字的第二个特点是：许多字的字头字旁是相同的，如“室、宣”等都是“宀”头；“树、桶”等都是“木”旁。要是学会了一些字头和字旁，再配上其它笔划，也就会写许多字了。
    还有一些字，是由几个异形或同形的字凑在一起，而成了另外一个字，如“明、朋”等，这是方块字的第三个特点。
    其次，对于初学写字者说来，到底那些字难写，那些字不好写呢？
    学员们说：“笔划少的字好写，笔划多的字难写。”这话是有道理的。这告诉我们教学时应掌握
    “由简到繁”的原则。但是，实际观察他们在写的过程中，遇着之、心、弓、也、多这一类的字，笔划虽然少，但由于它的转折多或是斜形笔划，写起来也很蹩扭。另外，又看见他们写语文课本的“语”、
    “课”及轰炸的“轰”字，笔划虽多，但由于它是几个简单的字凑合在一起的，知道了笔顺，写起来也不困难。因此，不能以笔划的繁简来决定写字的难易，而要结合字的笔式和形状，来掌握“由易到难”的教学方法。
    二、怎样教呢？
    在教写字以前，首先就要教学员拿笔的要领。往往开始写字的人，不会拿笔或者把笔握的很紧，深怕它会跑掉似的。遇到这种情形，就要告诉他们用大拇指和食指尖拿着笔杆的下端，中指在后面抵着，笔的上端靠着拇指和食指交叉的地方，小指不要紧贴在纸上，写起字来才灵活。以后，就分以下几个步骤进行：
    第一步，教笔划（一小时）。
    什么叫笔划呢？简单的说就是：“点（、）、横
    （一）、竖（丨）、撇（丿）、挑（ノ）、捺（?）、钩（儿）、折（??）”这八种。
    教笔划时，把八种基本笔划，用一张大纸写好，像教注音符号一样，贴在黑板上，除了告诉学员每个笔划的名称外，还要告诉学员写到什么地方要注意重轻、快慢。如写“乚”到弯的地方要慢一点，写到钩的地方要稍重一些，不要把“乚”写成“?”了。
    第二步，教笔顺（一小时）。
    中国字样子虽多，但它有一定的规律，写的时候应从什么地方写起，先写那一笔，后写那一笔，都有一定的次序，就叫笔顺。总起来，有以下五个原则：
    （一）从左到右：如“化、时、班”等字，都是先写左边后写右边。但也有例外的字。如“进、廷”等，是先把右边写好了，然后再写左边，仅仅带“辶”“廴”形一类的字是这样，我们把它当作特例看好了。
    （二）先上后下：如“空、是、重”等字。
    （三）先横后竖：如“土、木、打”等字。如果把这原则扩大一点，凡是一个字起笔处如有一横和其它笔交叉的，都要先写一横，如“左、古”等字就是这样。
    （四）先撇后捺：如“八、人、分”等字。
    （五）从外到里，先进入，后关门：如“囚、因、固”等字。
    写字掌握了这五个原则，无论什么字，都知道从什么地方写起，也就不会写倒笔了。不过这五个原则，在写字时，不是截然分开的，而是互相紧密联系着的，往往写一个字，同时要用几个原则。
    教时，除了把笔顺的原则告诉学员外，还要分解举例来教他们。
    第三步，教字旁和字头（两小时）。
    字旁和字头，在旧的说法上叫“部首”。它是组成字的主要部分，也是字的开头。同样一个部首，可以组成很多不同的字。熟练了常用的部首，就可以减少起笔的困难，并且对于记字和分别字义，也有很大的帮助。常见的有如下十九种：“亻彳氵冫扌忄刂阝犭牜衤礻?宀艹??广疒”。教时先讲名称，再举例说明用途。并尽量形象化。如“阝”可以说这不是像人的耳朵吗？同时还可以适当的联系到它的部位和用法，如我们耳朵长在头的两旁，因此
    “阝”也总是在字的侧旁，如“部队”二字。讲解后，叫学员反覆练习这些字头和字旁，不必练字，达到熟练为止。
    第四步，教字的偏旁（两小时）。
    偏旁是一个字组成部分的一半，它本身也是一个完整的字。因此，凡是有偏旁组成的字，它与偏旁本身的意义是分不开的，如“火”旁组成的“烧”、“炒”，总与火有关。在教时应把这些道理告诉学员，以提高学习兴趣。另外，熟练了偏旁，不但在写字上解决了一半困难，而且对于字义的领会更深。常用的偏旁有如下二十七种，“木火山土口囗女文方力巾立斤言虫月（月）日足石辛金食贝目雨戈门”。教后叫学员练习写（组成的字不必写）熟练后即可给写复杂的字打下基础。
    以上的几种教法，除了在课堂上正式教学员学习外，还可以用布置环境的方式，把笔划、部首、偏旁到处画上，使学员随时随地有学习的机会。
    三、怎样教学员练字
    学员有了以上的写字基础后，就进一步教他们练字了。这时应紧紧掌握“由易到难、由简到繁”的原则。
    同时在教学中还要告诉学员：写字要端正，上下大小要配匀。当然，在开始时不应对其要求过高，练字最好把纸打上方格写。当学员有了写字基础时，再向他们提出写字的标准：第一要写得正确；第二要写得整齐；第三要写得快。
    为了使学员容易记住写字的要领，我们编了一个快板给学员念，学员反映：“这样最容易记了。”这一快板可以在教学中，使学员熟记：
    “学习写字有要领，基本笔划先弄清。
    点横竖撇学会写，挑捺钩折要练精，
    字头偏旁熟练后，笔顺原则记在心，
    写字先从左边起，从上到下要记清，
    先横后竖不能混，竖要写直横要平，
    先撇后捺有规定，从外到里后关门，
    左右长短要相称，上下大小要均匀，
    写出字儿要端正，歪歪扭扭可不成，
    正确整齐合标准，快写快练要认真。”四、几点体会
    （一）教员教笔划时，一定要写得准确正规，不能有丝毫的潦草或马虎。因为学员的摹仿性很强，同时第一次接受的印象特别深；如果开始错了，以后改都不好改。
    （二）教完一小节，要作测验（默写）。测验的方法是说出笔划、部首、偏旁的名称，叫他们写出来。有空时更要熟练“搬家”。
    　（三）要展开写字互助。不然一个人写下去，会把很多笔划写走了样子。因此，就必须把小组里写得好的人动员起来，帮助写字差的。
