	Marxist-Leninist theoretical study has become an urgent need for medical intellectuals. Based on their personal experience, they have recognized the powerful and burgeoning strength of Marxist-Leninist theory. The more profoundly and fully the Soviet health workers understand the great revolutionary science, the more conscious their actions and the more clearly defined their goals will be, and at the same time, they will be able to complete their tasks more smoothly.

	Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin party, the Soviet people are successfully building a communist society. The role of advanced science, Marxist theory, in our country is great and glorious. Mass political education is of increasing importance because communism means not only the growth of social material wealth, but also the tremendous and unprecedented increase in the spiritual strength of the people, the culture and awareness of all workers. Therefore, our cadres' thirst for knowledge is natural, and their intention to grasp the Communist worldview is also understandable.

	In our country, all conditions have been created for the ideological and theoretical improvement of intellectuals. Medical workers are striving to use these conditions more widely and fully. Thousands of Party and non-Party Bolsheviks study the classics of Marxism-Leninism according to personal plans, or in small groups and classroom discussions. Many doctors and secondary medical personnel have completed their study of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." More people are studying dialectical and historical materialism, political economy, and the foreign policy of the Soviet state. In the Marxist-Leninist universities and their branches alone, there are now nearly 30,000 doctors studying.

	In this academic year of the Party's education system, which is about to end, there are many new qualitative characteristics. These characteristics are primarily the expansion in the number of experts in individual theoretical and Party history research, and the significant increase in advanced study groups. Many doctors and secondary medical personnel have completed their study of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course." More people are studying dialectical and historical materialism, political economy, and the foreign policy of the Soviet state. In the Marxist-Leninist universities and their branches alone, there are now nearly 30,000 doctors studying.

	In this academic year, ideological level has improved a lot, and the content of Party propaganda has also been significantly enriched. Doctors strive to creatively connect the principles of dialectical materialism with specific issues in their profession and the tasks before them. They observe the facts and phenomena of daily life from a Marxist standpoint, and they use the reliable and effective science of communism - an endless source of creation, a powerful tool of knowledge.

	In the ideological work system of medical institutions, popularizing and studying Pavlov's physiology and the worldview of domestic natural science classical writers occupies a considerable position. Studying the legacy of famous Russian scientists can enrich patriotic feelings and help to more deeply understand and better apply advanced materialist ideas. Pavlov's theory is a sharp and reliable weapon in the struggle against idealism in physiology and medicine, and in the struggle against old and outdated views.

	The Party organizations of medical institutions should use the positive experiences accumulated this year. The skillful combination of doctors' political study and in-depth specialized knowledge study is a guarantee of the success of ideological and theoretical education for cadres. Theoretical conferences on the study of individual works of scientists should also be supported and fully endorsed. Critically analyzing the content of these works from the standpoint of Marxist philosophy will develop dialectical thinking, the concreteness and independence of reasoning.

	The propagandist plays a decisive role in the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres. As a rule, those who now lead various political studies in hospitals and research institutes are doctors and staff of these institutions, who are the most cultivated and prestigious Communist Party members among the masses. For example, it is no accident that almost half of the more than 100 propagandists in the First Moscow Medical Institute are Doctors and Masters of Science. It is also a feature that many of those designated as advisors for personal study of Party history in the School of Malariology and Parasitology have won Stalin Prizes.

	Party district committees and municipal committees often invite doctors to give lectures, answer questions, and lead classroom discussions. This shows the ideological growth of cadres and their increased political enthusiasm; this is the result of the educational work of the Party organization, the result of doctors' hard study of Marxist-Leninist theory.

	The Party organizations of medical institutions are paying more attention to the political education of doctors, and are leading the coursework more deeply and consistently, which is an irrefutable fact. However, a formalistic attitude towards this cause has not yet been eradicated; in many places, the role of political education in training cadres is underestimated. Now, on the eve of the completion of the academic year in the education system, it is very important to expose the mistakes and omissions that have occurred recently.

	For example, in the children's treatment and prevention joint hospital in Ivanovo City, most of the staff did not study this year. This happened because the Party organization of the hospital did not care about the training of propagandists in a timely manner, but relied on sending propagandists from outside. Some people who had already completed "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" were eager to continue studying and researching other classical works of Marxism-Leninism. But they were not given leadership and help, so they stopped studying.

	There are also some Party organization leaders who only care about boasting about high figures in reporting materials. If judged according to statistical tables, for example, in the Third Municipal Hospital of Tallinn, all doctors are independently studying Party history according to personal plans. But this is only based on statistical materials. In fact, most of them have not systematically studied this year. In order to make up for the loopholes, the hospital has begun to hold theoretical conferences and symposiums to discuss several works at the same time. However, the discussions are conducted in a hurry, without due preparation, without in-depth research, and few staff members participate in the meetings. It is probably not necessary to list more significant examples of this formalistic and irresponsible attitude towards organizing the Party's educational work.

	The essence of Bolshevik propaganda work is combative, effective and specific; this kind of Bolshevik propaganda work is incompatible with stereotypes, scholastic attitudes, and formalism. The Party teaches us to judge the results of educating people not according to formal, statistical materials, but according to living, concrete facts and the creative achievements of the staff. Every Communist Party member, every non-Party Bolshevik, should strive to profoundly and consciously master the Party's theory and be good at applying the knowledge gained to practice. This is important in ideological work, and we should never forget it.

	The academic year is coming to an end. In the medical institutions in rural areas, summaries of achievements are being made; in the cities, coursework will be summarized in June, and consultation meetings and symposiums will be held to consolidate the knowledge gained during the year, find out the achievements in study, and determine where who will go to study in the new academic year. The main task now is to complete the academic year in an organized manner and at a high ideological level.

	That is to say, to organize this matter in such a way that every day is not wasted in vain, so that there is a clear, well-thought-out schedule for summarizing coursework in every medical institution. That is to say, to comprehensively and self-critically analyze the summary of the year and check all errors and omissions. That is to say, to start paying attention to the training of propagandists now and to establish an educational network for the new academic year.

	Accuracy and organization are the decisive conditions for the success of this important stage.

	Party organizations should pay special attention to summarizing the political self-study of cadres. To this end, lectures and reports on important issues of the courses studied should be expanded more widely, and the outlines of group consultation meetings, symposiums, and meetings should be considered.

	Organized completion of the academic year in the Party's education system, objective analysis of the summary of study, will help to further improve the ideological work of medical institutions and improve the quality and effect of cadre education. (Translated by Liu Jing)

### 医务工作者的马克思列宁主义教育  苏联“医务工作者”报社论

    医务工作者的马克思列宁主义教育
    苏联“医务工作者”报社论
    研究马克思列宁主义理论，已经成为医务知识分子的迫切需要了。他们根据亲身的经验，已认识了马克思列宁主义理论的强大的蓬勃的力量。苏联的卫生工作人员，愈深刻地、愈充分地通晓伟大的革命的科学，他们的行动就愈自觉，目的就愈明确，同时他们更能顺利地完成自己的任务。
    苏联人民在列宁—斯大林的党的领导下，成功地建设着共产主义社会。先进的科学，马克思主义理论在我国的作用是伟大的和光荣的。群众的政治教育，具有着愈益重大的意义，因为共产主义不仅意味着社会物质财富的增长，而且也意味着人民的精神力量、全体劳动者的文化和觉悟的巨大的空前的提高。因此，我们的干部们对知识的渴望是很自然的，同时他们掌握共产党的世界观的意图，也是可以理解的。
    在我国，为知识分子的思想—理论的提高建立了一切条件。医务工作者正在力求更广泛地、更充分地利用这些条件。成千上万的党的和非党的布尔什维克，按照个人的计划，或在小组和课堂讨论中，研究马克思列宁主义的经典著作。
    党的教育系统中即将结束的这一学年，有着许多新的质量上的特点。这些特点首先就是个人研究理论和党史的专家的数量扩大和高级学习小组显著增加。许多医生和中等医务工作人员，已经学习完“联共（布）党史简明教程”。研究辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、政治经济学和苏维埃国家对外政策等问题的人，更加多了。仅在各马克思列宁主义大学及其分院中，现在就有近三万名医生在学习。
    在这一学年中，思想水平提高了很多，党的宣传的内容也显著地丰富了。医生们力求把唯物辩证法的原理和自己的专业中的具体问题，以及他们面前的任务创造性地联系起来。他们从马克思主义的立场来观察日常生活的事实和现象，他们运用着使人信赖的、有成效的科学的共产主义的理论——创作的无尽泉源，认识的有力工具。
    在医务机关的思想工作体系中，普及和研究巴甫洛夫的生理学和本国的自然科学经典作家的世界观，占有不小的地位。对俄国著名的科学家遗产的研究，可以丰富爱国主义的感情，有助于更深刻地理解和更好地应用先进的唯物主义的思想。巴甫洛夫的学说，在与生理学和医学中的唯心论的斗争中，在与陈旧的、过了时的观点的斗争中，是一个锐利的可靠的武器。
    医务机关的党组织应当运用今年所积累起来的肯定经验。医生的政治学习和加深专门知识的学习的巧妙结合，是对干部进行思想、理论教育成功的保证。召开关于研究科学家们的个别著作的理论会议，也应当获得赞助和全面的支持。从马克思主义哲学的立场来批判这些著作的内容，将发展辩证的思维、推论的具体性和独立性。
    宣传员在干部的马克思列宁主义教育中起着决定性的作用。照例，现在领导医院和研究院的各种政治学习的，是这些机关的医生和工作人员，他们是最有修养的、在群众中享有威望的共产党员。例如，第一莫斯科医学研究院的一百多个宣传员之中，几乎一半都是科学博士和硕士，这决不是偶然的。在疟疾和寄生虫专科学校里，在被指定做为个人学习党史的顾问，有不少是荣获斯大林奖金的，这也是一种特征。
    党的区委会和市委会时常把医生们请来做讲演、解答问题并使他们领导课堂讨论。这说明干部的思想的成长和他们政治积极性的提高；这就是党组织教育工作的成果，是医生坚苦学习马克思列宁主义理论的结果。
    医务机关的党组织，对医生的政治教育问题的更加注意，更深刻地和始终如一地领导课业，这是不可反驳的事实。但是对这件事业的形式主义的态度，至今仍没有根除；许多地方，对培养干部中的政治教育的作用估计是不足的。现在，正当教育系统中的学年完成的前夕，揭露最近期间所发生的错误和疏忽是非常重要的。
    例如，伊万诺沃城的儿童治疗——预防联合医院里，大部分工作人员今年就没有学习。这件事情所以发生，就是因为医院的党组织没有适时地关心对宣传员的培养，而指望着从外面派来宣传员。早已学完了“联共（布）党史简明教程”的一些人们，渴望着继续学习和研究马克思列宁主义其他古典著作。但是对于他们没有领导和帮助，因而他们中止了学习。
    还有一些党组织的领导者，只关心夸耀报告材料上的高的数字。如果根据统计表来判断，例如，在塔林市立第三医院里，全部医生都在独立地按照个人的计划进行党史的学习。但这只是根据统计的材料。实际上，他们之中的大多数在本年内并没有有系统地进行学习。为了弥补漏洞，医院里已开始举行理论会议和同时讨论几部著作的座谈会。但讨论会进行得仓促，没有应有的准备，没有深刻的研究，参加会议的工作人员也不多。这种对于组织党的教育工作的形式主义的、不负责任的态度，恐怕不需要列举更加显著的例子了。
    布尔什维克的宣传工作，其本质是战斗的、有效的和具体的；这种布尔什维克的宣传工作，和陈规旧套、学究态度、形式主义是格格不入的。党教导我们判断教育人的成果不是按照形式上的、统计的材料，而是根据活生生的、具体的事实和工作人员创造性的成就。每一个共产党员，每一个非党布尔什维克，都应当努力深刻地和有意识地精通党的理论，并善于把已获得的知识应用到实际中去。这是思想工作中重要的，任何时候我们都不应该忘记的。
    学年将近结束。在农村的医务机关里，正在做成绩总结；在各城市里，六月内将总结课业、举行咨询会议和座谈会，其目的就是巩固一年中已获得的知识，找出学习中的成就，确定在新学年中谁将到什么地方去学习。现在主要的任务在于有组织地、在高度思想水平上来完成学年。
    这就是说，要这样把这件事情组织起来：使每天都不能白白地浪费过去，要使每个医务机关里有明确的、经过深思的总结课业的进程表。这就是说，全面地和自我批评地来分析一年的总结，检查所有的错误和疏忽。这就是说，现在就要开始注意培养宣传员，并建立起新学年的教育网。
    精确性和组织性，就是这个重要阶段的成功的决定性条件。
    党组织对干部的政治自学的总结应特别注意。为此，应更广泛展开对学习过的课程的重要问题的讲演报告，要考虑小组咨询会、座谈会和会议的提纲。
    在党教育系统中有组织地完成学年，客观地分析学习的总结，将有助于进一步提高医务机关的思想工作和改善干部教育的质量和效果。（刘竞译）
