Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th—On the 17th, the U.S. side's representatives to the Korean armistice talks once again unilaterally interrupted the negotiations, evading the negotiation meeting. On the 18th, our Chief Liaison Officer was instructed to notify the other side: the other side had no reason to unilaterally announce a three-day recess again on June 17th without mutual agreement, and to leave the meeting in the middle of it. This unilateral and unreasonable action on the part of the other side is clearly a deliberate attempt to delay the armistice negotiations. All responsibility for delaying the negotiations rests entirely with the other side.

    我首席联络官通知美方拖延谈判责任全在美方
    【新华社开城十八日电】十七日美方朝鲜停战谈判代表，又一次片面中断谈判，逃避谈判会议。十八日我方首席联络官奉命通知对方：对方没有任何理由在六月十七日未经双方协议，又一次片面宣布休会三天，并中途退出会场。对方这种片面无理行动，显然是蓄意拖延停战谈判。拖延谈判的一切责任全在对方。
