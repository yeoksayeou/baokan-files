    To the Editors: Before liberation, the people living in the border areas of Hunan and Guizhou provinces were regarded as "unassimilated barbarians" by the Kuomintang reactionaries and suffered from the poisonous "using Miao to rule Miao" policy. This area produces cinnabar, and most people make a living by mining it. At that time, the miners who mined cinnabar suffered greatly. They lived in dilapidated thatched huts that could not keep out the wind and snow, and they could not even get enough to eat vegetable roots and sweet potatoes. Generally, miners started working in rocky mountains and caves from the age of fourteen or fifteen. There were no safety and sanitation facilities in the mines. Many miners contracted lung disease and could not be treated, and often died before the age of forty. In order to resist the harsh exploitation and oppression, the miners constantly engaged in armed struggles with the rulers.
    In February 1950, this place was liberated. The people began to build beautiful homes on the land where they lived and grew up. The material life and sanitary conditions of the miners have been greatly improved. Literacy classes, newspaper reading groups, and study groups have been established in every mine. They live in newly built buildings. In winter, they have cotton clothes to wear. Their daily necessities are all supplied by the mine, and each person can also receive a subsidy of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per month. Most of the children aged seven to sixteen have entered school. Cinnabar is an important national defense material, and the miners' class consciousness has been raised, and they have put forward the slogan "Mining one more grain of cinnabar is equivalent to killing one more American devil." Their work efficiency is two or three times higher than before liberation. Like the people of the motherland, they have invested in the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
    The people in the border areas of Hunan and Guizhou provinces, who have been rescued from the abyss of suffering, are working hard for a happier tomorrow.

    湖南贵州两省边区的人民努力建设幸福的生活
    编辑同志：解放以前，湖南、贵州两省交界地方的人民，被国民党反动派当做不服教化的“边民”看待，受尽了“以苗治苗”的毒辣政策的毒害。这一带出产朱砂，人民多以开采朱砂为生。那时候，开采朱砂的矿工是非常苦的。他们住在遮不住风雪的破烂茅舍中，连菜根蕃薯都吃不饱。一般矿工从十四、五岁起，就到岩山石洞中去工作。矿内毫无安全卫生设备。许多矿工得了肺病，又无法医治，往往活不到四十岁就死了。矿工为了反抗苛重的剥削和压迫，不断和统治者进行械斗。
    一九五○年二月，这里解放了。人民开始在他们生息成长的土地上，建设美丽的家园。矿工们的物质生活和卫生条件都有了极大的改善。每个矿?里都成立了识字班、读报组、学习会。他们住在一幢幢新建起来的楼房里。在冬天，他们有了棉衣穿。他们的日用品由矿?里全部供给，每人每月还能得到二十万到三十万元的津贴费。七岁到十六岁的子弟，大半都进了学校。朱砂是重要的国防物资，矿工们的阶级觉悟提高了，提出“多采一粒朱砂，就等于多打死一个美国鬼子”的口号。他们的工作效率高出解放前二倍或三倍。他们和祖国人民一样地投入了伟大的抗美援朝运动中。
    从水深火热中被解救出来的湖南、贵州两省的边区人民，正在辛勤劳动，为更幸福的明天而工作。     怀池
