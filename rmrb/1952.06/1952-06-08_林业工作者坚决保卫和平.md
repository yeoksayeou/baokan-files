Forestry Workers Resolutely Defend Peace
    Liang Xi, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have gained liberation through arduous struggle, and also obtained true peace. The Chinese people love and cherish their peaceful life.

    While the people of the whole country are resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending their peaceful life through struggle, New China has also launched peaceful construction. In the blueprint for peaceful construction, forestry construction is greening the background of the entire blueprint with its unique color.

    New China's forestry construction work has just begun, but it has an extremely bright and promising future. For example, forest aerial surveying used to be just a dream for forestry workers. Because the corrupt and decadent Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's planes were only used to slaughter the Chinese people and carry the wealthy and bureaucratic. But in New China, in the winter of 1951, the central and northeastern forestry departments dispatched planes to inspect the forest conditions of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and estimated the timber reserves per unit area. In the spring of 1952, for two whole months, airplanes serving New China's forestry construction patrolled and watched over the northeast and Inner Mongolia, preventing mountain fires; and in May, large transport planes dropped food for the fire-fighting teams that had entered the deep mountains. Soon, New China will have formal forest aerial surveys.

    Afforestation is important, and greening is beautiful. There is an old Chinese saying: "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to nurture people." Planting trees and creating forests is a century-old plan for national construction. In the past two years, the footprints of forestry workers have been found everywhere: in the Changbai Mountains and Lesser Khingan Mountains of the northeast, the Tianshan Mountains, Qilian Mountains, Xiaolong Mountains, Tao River, and Bailong River basins of the northwest, as well as the Min River, Dadu River, and Qingyi River basins of Qinghai and the southwest, and even the Pingwu Tibetan area of northern Sichuan and the Dawei Mountain on the Yunnan border, which no one dared to inspect before. Under the leadership of the People's Government, relying on the hardworking, brave, and peace-loving people, our achievements in afforestation last year exceeded more than twice the total afforestation area of the Kuomintang reactionary government in twenty-two years. In forestry construction, we used mechanical logging equipment. In the northeast forest area, tractors are being used, large timber trucks are being purchased, river channels are being repaired every year, and forest railways are being extended every year. General forest areas have cooperatives, employee dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, and clubs. In more concentrated forest areas, there are also hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, nursing homes, spare-time schools, and schools for employees' children. The workers are working with the attitude of masters of their own affairs, and 95 percent participate in cultural studies. A large number of model workers have emerged: logging model Liu Jingui, logging and transportation model Chi Youtian, forest railway model Wang Chunwen, and lumbering model Liu Fenjiang – these names are no longer unfamiliar. Outside of the northeast, timber companies have been successively established in the southwest, northwest, central south, and Shanxi in North China, and many new lumber mills have been built. A series of emerging timber industries are booming. New China's forest areas are showing a thriving scene everywhere.

    Peace-loving people cultivate green forests with their diligent hands, generation after generation, while reactionary rulers and invaders constantly bring infinite disasters to them. Before liberation, the pine forests of Laoshan in Shandong were shaved bare by the barbarous US Navy. In the armed guerrilla areas of Hainan Island, Chiang's bandit air force used incendiary bombs to burn down many forests. In Japan, the militarists of World War II brought even greater disasters to Japanese forestry. Mr. Miyakoshi Kisuke, the Japanese representative attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, said: During the war, the excellent forests of Akita, Kochi, Gifu, Aichi, Nagano, Aomori, Yamagata, and other prefectures were subjected to the ruthless deforestation by the militarist aggressors. Large timber was snapped up by shipyards to build 250-ton and 150-ton wooden ships. Small timber was scrambled for by paper mills and rayon factories; small trees of around thirty years old were just right. As a result of the deforestation, he said: the reaction was quick; in the downstream areas of the rivers in Ōita, Miyazaki, Okayama, Hyogo, and other prefectures, floods, which were rare in history, commonly occurred. Natural disasters inevitably cause the people's suffering. The devastation of the beautiful forests of Korea by American planes is something that peace-loving people all over the world are united in their anger at.

    The Chinese people need peace. Forestry construction is a century-old plan and needs lasting peace even more. Now the locomotive of New China's forestry construction has started. Forestry workers across the country are confident that thirty years from now, we will eliminate 50 percent of barren mountains and wastelands, completely eliminate the sandy wastes in the interior and the barren mountains near villages, and basically complete the water source forests of large and small rivers. This vision is beautiful and exciting, and the prerequisite for accomplishing these tasks is to resolutely defend peace.

    The beautiful vision encourages our forestry workers across the country. We are willing to unite closely with the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region and the peace-loving people of the world, and use a hundredfold effort to fight against any conspiracy that attempts to undermine world peace and Far Eastern peace, so as to defend peace and strive for lasting peace.

    林业工作者坚决保卫和平
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员  梁希
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下经过艰苦的斗争获得了解放，也获得了真正的和平。中国人民热爱和珍惜自己的和平生活。
    在全国人民抗美援朝、以斗争来保卫自己的和平生活的同时，新中国又展开了和平建设。在和平建设的蓝图上面，林业建设以它特有的色彩绿化着整个蓝图的背景。
    新中国的林业建设工作刚刚开始，但它却具有极其光明远大的前途。举例说吧：森林航空测量，过去曾经只是林业工作者的一种梦想。因为腐败透顶的蒋介石匪帮的飞机是只用来屠杀中国人民和装载豪门官僚的。但是在新中国，一九五一年冬中央和东北林业部就派出飞机视察了大、小兴安岭的森林概况，推测了单位面积的木材蓄积量。一九五二年春，整整两个月，新中国为林业建设服务的飞机在东北和内蒙上空巡逻、了望、防备山火；还用大运输机在五月间替走入深山的救火队投了粮。不久，新中国还将具备正规化的森林航空测量。
    营林，是重要的，绿化，是美丽的。中国有句老话叫：“十年树木，百年树人”。植树造林是国家建设的百年大计。两年以来，东北的长白山和小兴安岭、西北的天山、祁连山、小陇山、洮河和白龙江流域以及青海、西南的岷江、大渡河和青衣江流域，还有从来无人敢去视察的川北平武藏区和云南边境的大围山，到处印遍了林业工作者的足迹。在人民政府的领导下，我们依靠了勤劳勇敢和爱好和平的人民，在去年一年造林的成绩，超过了国民党反动政府二十二年造林面积总和的两倍以上。在林业建设中，我们使用了机械采伐设备。在东北林区，拖拉机用起来了，运材大汽车在购置，河道年年修治，森林铁道年年延长。一般林区都有合作社、职工宿舍、食堂、澡堂、俱乐部。比较集中的林区，还有医院、疗养所、托儿所、养老院、业余学校、职工子弟学校。工人们以主人翁的态度劳动着，百分之九十五参加了文化学习。一大群一大群劳动模范涌现出来：采伐模范刘金贵、采伐运材模范迟有田、森铁模范王纯文、制材模范刘芬江，这些名字都不生疏了。东北以外，西南、西北、中南和华北的山西，都陆续成立了木材公司，新建了许多制材厂。一系列新兴的木材工业，正在蓬勃地发展。新中国的林区，无处不呈现欣欣向荣的景象。
    爱好和平的人民用勤劳的双手一代代地培植起青绿的森林，而反动统治者和侵略者则不断地带给它无限的灾害。解放以前，山东崂山的松林被野蛮的美国海军剃了光头。海南岛的人民武装游击区，蒋匪空军用烧夷弹烧毁许多森林。在日本，第二次世界大战军国主义者带给日本林业的灾害更大。出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的日本代表宫腰喜助先生说：在大战中，秋田、高知、岐阜、爱知、长野、青森、山形等县的大好森林，都遭到军国主义侵略者无情的滥伐。大材被造船厂抢购，拿去造二百五十吨与一百五十吨的木船。小材被造纸厂与人造丝工厂争买，三十年上下的小树恰合胃口。滥伐的结果，据他说：反应甚快；大分、宫崎、冈山、兵库等县河川下游的地方，普遍地遭到历史上不常见的水灾。自然的灾害必然引起人民的灾难。朝鲜美丽山林所遭受美国飞机的摧残，更是全世界爱好和平人民所一致愤怒的。
    中国人民需要和平。林业建设是百年大计，更需要持久的和平。现在新中国林业建设的车头已经开动了。全国林业工作者有信心保证：三十年以后，我们将消灭荒山荒地百分之五十，把内地沙荒及村庄附近的山荒全部消灭，把大小河流的水源林基本上完成。这一远景是美丽而令人兴奋的，而完成这些事业的先决条件是必须坚决地保卫和平。
    美丽的远景鼓舞着我们全国的林业工作者。我们愿意同亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民紧密团结，用千百倍的努力来向任何企图破坏世界和平与远东和平的阴谋进行斗争，以保卫和平，争取持久的和平。
