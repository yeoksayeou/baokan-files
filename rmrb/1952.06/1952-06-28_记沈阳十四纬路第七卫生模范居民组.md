    A Record of the Seventh Health Model Resident Group of Shisiwei Road, Shenyang
    Wei Jun
    In the South District of Shenyang, there is a quiet Shisiwei Road. At its eastern end, there is Yangcheng Lane, home to the city's famous fly-free group—the Seventh Resident Group of the Second Central Team. Yangcheng Lane is not very wide, and the rows of closely arranged blue brick bungalows are already old. There is no tap water or sewers here. Residents drink water from foreign wells, occasionally buying a load or two of sweet water. Most residents are vendors, small workers, or rickshaw pullers, with a very few workers and office staff. The entire group consists of sixty-six people living in twelve courtyards, with four or five to as many as eight or nine households in a small courtyard, and each courtyard has children, some with more than ten. In short, such a residential area has no particularly advantageous material conditions for paying attention to hygiene.
    However, when you walk into Yangcheng Lane, the first impression is: cleanliness. The ground is clean and smooth, without any discarded garbage or dirty water. The lower half of the walls are painted with white lime, and each courtyard, though small, is swept clean. Residents who keep livestock have tall chicken coops and pigsties, with no unpleasant odors. Every household has window screens and bamboo door curtains to prevent mosquitoes and flies from other places from flying in. Almost every courtyard has a covered sewage well, and the toilets are also up to standard, with no dirt around, preventing mosquitoes and flies from breeding. If you go into each home, the rooms are tidy, and although the unpainted walls reveal their original color—earthy yellow—the entire room still gives a feeling of cleanliness and order; everything is arranged methodically. If you were to meticulously touch the door frames, lift the mat, or look for the most inconspicuous corners, you would find all these places equally clean. In the home of the group leader, Cui Ying, even the small porcelain insulators on the electric wires are wiped sparkling white. It turns out that in addition to regular cleaning, the entire group also has a major cleaning every Saturday. Everyone moves out the furniture and sweeps and wipes the ceilings, corners, and other places, cleaning every corner. Because they maintain cleanliness at all times, the major cleaning is not necessarily particularly strenuous. Basically, the entire group meets the following three standards in terms of environmental hygiene: universal and comprehensive, thorough and complete, and maintained regularly.
    The improvement of environmental hygiene in the Seventh Resident Group is inseparable from the consistent concern of the People's Government for the health of the people. Since the liberation of Shenyang, due to the People's Government's concern for the residents' health and the rise in the people's living standards, the hygiene and health of the people throughout the city have been gradually improving. Last summer, the government called for the development of a general, seasonal health campaign, and the Seventh Resident Group took the initiative to become a fly-free group. They established a system of rotating duty to clean the streets and courtyards, improving environmental hygiene so that everyone could live healthier lives. In the beginning, some people's minds hadn't turned around yet, and there were often disputes. For example, when it came to sweeping the streets, if Zhang San swept the street and a strong wind blew all night, bringing a lot of garbage, Li Si refused to take over the next day, complaining to the group leader. Li Si said that Zhang San did not clean well, and Zhang San swore that he had cleaned it yesterday and that it was nothing to do with him. Also, if Aunt Li criticized Zhang Sao's child for making the yard dirty, Zhang Sao would scold and swear in the house, venting her anger on the child. However, the masses' awareness was rapidly increasing, and with the patient explanations of the street cadres, the group leader, and others, the idea of treating cleaning as a burden and being unwilling to do a little more was gradually corrected. Everyone realized that the cleaner they swept, the fewer the chances of getting sick. Therefore, last year, the Seventh Group became a fly-free group, and no one fell ill.
    This March, the American imperialists' germ-carrying pests fell on Shenyang, and the residents of the entire group, in order to protect their lives and health, urgently mobilized and went to the front line of the anti-bacterial warfare. At that time, a few people were not clear in their understanding. Old Man Liu said, "A few flies won't amount to much." And Old Man Jiang the Second, upon seeing a fly while holding his rice bowl, would panic, thinking only that once infected, there would be no good outcome. These ideas, after the health cadres and group leader's repeated propaganda on hygiene knowledge and after everyone's study and discussion, were also gradually overcome. Everyone believed that as long as we take action, no matter how much the American devils drop, we will eliminate that much, and they will be of no use! From then on, they had great confidence and were full of enthusiasm, and achieved certain results in the anti-bacterial warfare.
    In actual combat, they realized that it is not enough for one family to be good; everyone must be clean in order to prevent illness well. Their material conditions were not abundant, so they helped each other and came up with various ways to overcome difficulties. Military dependent Wang Enpu and his blind wife, Shao Suxian, had a relatively difficult life, so the government took care of them and gave them a window screen. Old Wang's family had an old door curtain and gave it to Shao Suxian, who took it back to her mother's house to repair it and hung it up. The masses also helped her take apart and wash the bedding. Some saved their children's snack money, little by little, to buy window screens. Jin Shoupeng, who sold vegetables, made a small jar with a lid to use as a spittoon. As for cleaning public places, not only were those on duty diligent, sweeping several times a day, but even if it wasn't their turn, whoever could do it would clean it. Everyone was harmonious and united, and the previous disputes could no longer be found. At the end of the lane, there was a small open space, and everyone cleaned it and installed a swing set as a place for children to play.
    On April 10th, the residents of the Seventh Group signed a patriotic health pact. The characteristic of this pact was that each family made a different pact, based on the specific circumstances of their family, making specific arrangements. For example, how many days to empty the water tank, how many days to boil the bowls and chopsticks, how many days to take a bath, change clothes, not eat cold food, and so on. They inspected the implementation of the pact once a week. Every day after breakfast, the health committee member, Old Man Gao, would come out and walk around to see if everyone had any difficulties in implementing the pact. Another health committee member, Old Lady Li, and the group leader, Cui Ying, would also often take time to check in the courtyards. According to Old Man Gao, every family consciously and voluntarily implemented the pact, and many of the contents have now become people's habits.
    Among the street residents, women are often the main force on the health front. In the case of the Seventh Group, the situation is also the same. The women are not afraid of hardship, regardless of the burden of their children, getting up early and working late, washing, wiping, and sweeping diligently, constantly maintaining cleanliness. What power makes them work so hard? What power makes them so enthusiastic? I got the answer from the conversations with the health committee member, Old Lady Li, and Shi Yuying, the mother of seven children.
    Sixty-year-old Old Lady Li has four sons, three of whom are working, and the youngest, an eighteen-year-old son, is studying in middle school, living a relatively comfortable life. The old lady has always loved cleanliness and keeps herself neat and tidy. She gets up early and goes out to sweep the streets and courtyards. During the day, when she has time, she also goes to the courtyards to check. I asked the old lady if she was tired. Old Lady Li smiled and said, "Before, at this age, who would need me! Living to be sixty years old and catching up with such a country, being able to serve the people makes me very happy, and I don't feel tired."
    In the home of Shi Yuying, the mother of seven children, adults and children all understand the importance of hygiene and have a strong hatred for the American devils. Seven-year-old Jinghui can recite health ballads, and four-year-old Xiren also knows that the germs dropped by the American devils have bacteria. His mother asked him, "Who made us eat our fill?" "Chairman Mao." I asked him, "Who dropped the germs down?" "The American devils." "Do you hate them?" "Hate them!" This short conversation fully demonstrates the shared love and hatred of their mother and son. Shi Yuying described in detail the deep suffering of living in the old society in the past. She said, "At that time, we couldn't even eat our fill, so how could we care about hygiene!" Now, life is much better than in the past. When four-year-old Xiren was in swaddling clothes, he was fed mixed noodles, and eight-month-old Ximing can eat eggs and biscuits. It's not that the mother is biased, because the whole family's life has improved. Shi Yuying said that she would never let the second generation suffer injustice, and she would never let her children be harmed by the American devils. She said, "Doing hygiene work is like fighting a war with the enemy, I'm willing to put in all my effort." She used to be afraid to catch bugs, but now, "If the American germ warfare criminals were standing in front of me, I would dare to stab them a few times!"
    This kind of feeling—love for the motherland and the new life, and a strong hatred for the American imperialists who spread germs—is universally present among the masses. This has become the great driving force for the Seventh Resident Group in the patriotic health movement.
    The Seventh Resident Group is just one of countless ordinary resident groups. As long as this feeling of the masses is correctly guided to hygiene work, then countless health model groups, countless Seventh Resident Groups, will emerge along with it.

    记沈阳十四纬路第七卫生模范居民组
    维君
    沈阳市南市区有条僻静的十四纬路，它的东头有条仰承里胡同，住着全市著名的无蝇组——第二中心小组第七居民组。仰承里胡同并不十分宽阔，一排排栉比鳞次的青砖平房已经上了年纪。这儿没有自来水、没有下水道，居民吃着洋井里的水，间或买上一两挑甜水。居民的职业多半是摊贩、小工、三轮车夫，也有极少数的工人与机关职员。全组六十六口人，大门对大门住在十二个院子里，一个小院子住有四五户到八九户不等，每个院里都有小孩，多的竟有十多个。总之，像这样的居民区，在讲究卫生方面，没有任何特殊优越的物质条件。
    但是，当你走进仰承里胡同，首先一个印象：清洁。地面上干净平整，没有扔弃的垃圾或脏水。墙的下半截都刷了白灰，每个院子虽然不大，也扫得干干净净。养有家畜的住户，都有高大的鸡笼、猪圈，没有一点难闻的味儿。家家有窗纱、竹门帘，防止别处的蚊、蝇飞入。每个院子差不多的污水井都加上盖，厕所也合格，周围没有一点脏污的东西，使蚊蝇无从孳生。你要再走进每个家庭，屋里都收拾得整整齐齐，尽管未经粉刷的墙露着本来面目——土黄色，整个房间仍然给人以洁净和秩序井然的感觉；一切住家过日子的东西都安放得有条不紊。你要挑剔地去摸摸门框、掀掀炕席或找寻最不容易使人注意的角落，你会发现所有这些地方也同样的洁净。组长崔英家里，连电灯线上的小磁瓶都擦得雪白。原来全组除了经常的清扫外，每逢星期六还有一次大扫除。大家抬出家具，在天棚、屋角等地方扫的扫、抹的抹，把各个角落打扫干净。因为平时保持清洁，大扫除时倒不一定特别费劲。基本上，全组在环境卫生方面符合这样三项标准：普遍全面、深入彻底、保持经常。
    第七居民组环境卫生的改进与人民政府一向关心人民健康是分不开的。沈阳解放后，由于人民政府的关心居民卫生情况、由于人民生活水平的上升，全市人民的卫生、健康情况都在逐渐地改进。去年夏天，政府号召开展一个一般性、季节性的卫生工作，第七居民组便发起要成为无蝇组。他们订出制度，轮流值日打扫街道和院子，改进环境卫生，好使大家过得更健康。刚开始，也有人脑筋没转过弯来，时常有纠纷。譬如扫街道吧，如果张三扫完街道后，晚上刮了一夜大风，吹来不少垃圾，第二天李四便不肯接班，闹到组长那儿。李四说张三不好好清扫，张三便赌咒立誓说昨天已经扫干净，与己无关。再譬如李大婶批评了张大嫂的孩子弄脏了院子，张大嫂便在屋内指桑骂槐，打孩子出气。但群众的觉悟是在迅速地提高，再加上街道干部、组长等耐心的解释，这种把清扫当负担，不愿多做一点的思想，逐渐得到纠正。大家认识到越打扫得干净，越减少得病的机会，因此，在去年第七组便已成为无蝇组，没有一个闹病的。
    今年三月，美帝国主义带菌的毒虫落到了沈阳，全组居民为了保护生命健康，紧急动员起来走上了反细菌战的前线。当时，也有少数人认识不清。老刘大爷说：“几个苍蝇，成不了大事。”而老姜二哥呢，端起饭碗见一个苍蝇心里就慌，光想起一旦传染上，就没个好。这些思想经过卫生干部、组长的反复宣传卫生常识，经过大家的学习讨论，也逐
    一克服了。大家都认为只要我们动手，美国鬼子扔多少，我们消灭它多少，它就什么用也不顶！从此，他们信心很高，情绪饱满，并在反细菌战中得到一定的成绩。
    他们在实际斗争中体会到：一家好还不算好，大家都干净才能预防好。他们的物质条件不充裕，大家便互济互助，并想出各种办法来克服困难。军属汪恩普和他双目失明的妻子邵素贤生活比较困难，政府便予以照顾，给了一个窗纱。老王家有个旧门帘，送给邵素贤，邵拿回娘家修理一下，一样挂上了。群众并帮助她拆洗了被褥。有人节省下孩子零食钱，一点点攒起来置买窗纱。卖菜的金寿鹏弄了个小罐，加上盖，代替痰筒使用。至于打扫公共场所，不但值日的勤勉，每天多扫几遍，即使不值日，谁得手谁就打扫了。大家既和睦，又团结，从前的纠纷再也找不到了。胡同尽头有块小小的空地，大家把它打扫得干干净净，安上秋千架，作为儿童游戏的场所。
    四月十日那天，第七组居民订立了爱国卫生公约，这个公约的特点，是家家订得不同，按照各人家庭具体情况，订出具体办法。如几天掏一次水缸，几天煮一次碗筷，几天洗一次澡，换衣服，不吃生冷东西等等。一星期检查一次执行的情况。每天早饭后，卫生委员高老大爷便出来了，走到各处看看，了解大家在执行上有什么困难，另一卫生委员老李太太和组长崔英也常抽空到各院检查。据高老大爷说，家家都自觉自愿地执行，有许多内容现已成为人们的习惯了。
    在街道居民中，妇女往往是卫生战线上的主力军。以第七组来说，情形也是如此。妇女们不怕辛苦，不顾孩子的累赘，起早贪黑，勤洗、勤抹、勤扫，经常保持清洁。究竟什么力量使她们不辞劳苦呢？究竟什么力量使她们如此热情呢？我从卫生委员老李太太和七个孩子的母亲施玉英的谈话中，得到了回答。
    六十岁的老李太太有四个儿子，三个在做事，最小的十八岁的儿子在中学读书，生活较宽裕。老太太一贯爱干净，收拾得头脚利落。清早起来，就出去扫街道、扫院子，白天有时间还上各院去检查检查。我问老太太累不累？老李太太笑着说：“早先这么大年纪，谁用得着我！活到六十岁了，赶上这样的国家，能为人民服个务，就挺高兴的了，不觉得累。”
    七个孩子的妈妈施玉英家里，大人、孩子都懂得卫生的重要，对美国鬼子有着强烈的憎恨。七岁的静惠会说卫生快板，四岁的希仁也知道美国鬼子扔下的毒虫上有细菌。他妈问他：“谁使我们吃饱了饭？”“毛主席。”我问他：“谁扔了毒虫下来？”“美国鬼子。”“你恨它不？”“恨！”这段简短的对话，充分表明了她们母子共同的爱与憎。施玉英详细地叙述过去在旧社会中生活的深重苦难，她说：“那时候，连饭都吃不饱，哪还顾得上讲卫生呀！”现在，生活比过去强得多了。四岁的希仁襁褓时喂的杂和面，八个月的希明，可以吃到鸡蛋和饼干。这不是妈妈偏心，因为全家生活都提高了。施玉英表示她决不能让第二代受屈，决不能让她的孩子受到美国鬼子的残害，她说：“我搞卫生工作，就像和敌人打仗一样，豁出一把力气干嘛。”她以前连虫子都不敢抓，现在，“要是美国细菌战犯站在我面前，我都敢扎他几下！”
    这种感情——对祖国与新生活的热爱，对撒布细菌的美帝国主义的强烈仇恨，在群众中是普遍存在的。这便成为第七居民组在爱国卫生运动中的伟大动力。
    第七居民组只是无数普通居民组中的一个，只要正确地引导群众的这种感情到卫生工作方面来，那么，无数卫生模范小组，无数第七居民组将随着出现。（原载六月二十二日东北日报）
