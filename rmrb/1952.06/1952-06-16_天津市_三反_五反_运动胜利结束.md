    Tianjin City's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements Victoriously Concluded
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, at a joint meeting held on the 5th, announced the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements throughout the city. It was also decided, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, to establish new public-private and labor-capital relations, actively develop production, prosper the economy, and guide the city's economy towards a healthier and more prosperous path.
    Mayor Huang Jing first summarized the overall situation in Tianjin at the meeting. He pointed out that the city's "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have basically concluded victoriously. The movement has yielded great results, exposing and eliminating the "three evils" and "five poisons," and repelling the frenzied attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, creating new favorable conditions for national construction. However, at the conclusion of the movement, it is necessary to pay attention to the temporary abnormal phenomena that accompany the movement and normalize them. In the "Three-Anti" aspect, in addition to the timely correction of some misjudgments and rigid approaches in certain units, economic personnel have received profound education in the movement and have become cautious about managing finances and materials. While this is good, there have been instances of excessive strictness, which are currently being actively addressed through education. In the "Five-Anti" aspect, some fluctuations have also occurred in labor-capital and public-private relations, such as certain employees and staff having excessively broad supervision and excessive demands on capitalists. In the business community, many people have developed some misconceptions and negative emotions, and are afraid to actively engage in business. These are also problems that are being addressed and need to be continuously addressed. But in general, the gains of this movement are great, and the achievements are the main aspect. The side effects mentioned above are still in the minority, individual, and temporary. This year's wheat harvest is abundant, and the autumn harvest is also very promising. Therefore, only if our entire economic structure is further activated in all aspects can it adapt to this impending prosperous situation. Therefore, how to victoriously conclude the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, adjust various economic relations, and overcome certain abnormal phenomena is what we must do at present.
    Zhang Fengshi, Secretary-General of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, reported on the conclusion and handling of the "Three-Anti" movement in Tianjin. He said that Tianjin's "Three-Anti" movement began to enter the handling phase in the second half of March. By mid-April, the "tiger-beating" work in general units had come to an end, and a full transition to handling work was made. As of now, most of the units have been fully concluded, except for a small number of units that still need about ten days to complete all handling. Zhang Fengshi pointed out that the "Three-Anti" movement in the city has been going on for more than five months and has achieved great results. Through this movement, state personnel and the broad masses of people have generally received profound education, and their political consciousness has been greatly improved. The clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style of state personnel has been further consolidated, and they and the broad masses of people have universally enhanced their sense of responsibility for protecting state property. During the movement, many state personnel deeply felt their past paralysis towards corruption and theft and raised their vigilance. At the same time, many institutions and enterprises discovered shortcomings and loopholes in organization, systems, and other aspects. These provide fully favorable conditions for future work improvement. Regarding the handling work, Zhang Fengshi pointed out that, in addition to severely punishing a very small number of individuals who refused to confess, were unwilling to repent, and committed heinous crimes, and removing them from government agencies and enterprises, the vast majority of corrupt individuals who confessed voluntarily were given lenient treatment, striving for them to atone for their crimes, make a new start, and become good staff members in the future. Such treatment fully embodies the people's government's policy of "combining severity and leniency, and combining reform and punishment."
    Wu Yannong, a member of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, said in a report on the "Five-Anti" movement: The "Five-Anti" movement in Tianjin has lasted for five months and has now basically concluded victoriously. Law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking industrial and commercial households have announced their conclusions and completed the handling; more than 400 seriously law-breaking and completely law-breaking industrial and commercial households have also been dealt with, and the results of the handling will be announced soon. Wu Yannong said that in order to properly conclude the "Five-Anti" movement and ensure that the determination of the cases and the handling work are correct, the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee recently conducted a serious review of all cases of half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking, seriously law-breaking, and completely law-breaking industrial and commercial households. In accordance with the principle of "strict struggle and lenient handling," the determination of the cases was verified. In calculating the amount of illegal income of industrial and commercial households, efforts were made to be consistent with reality. The criteria for determining the cases were not only based on the amount of illegal income, but more importantly, the consistent political performance of the industrial and commercial households, their role in economic construction, their attitude in the "Five-Anti" movement, and the circumstances of the illegal acts were considered, and then handled separately. Regarding the method of paying back the tax refunds and supplementary taxes of illegal industrial and commercial households, Wu Yannong explained that in order to avoid certain difficulties in the production and operation and capital turnover of industry and commerce, and to take into account that industrial and commercial households are currently paying income tax for 1951, the deadline for general industrial and commercial households to refund and supplement payments can be appropriately extended to after December of this year, except for individual seriously law-breaking households and completely law-breaking households who are required to pay off within a time limit. Individual refunds with larger amounts can also be resolved by other methods as appropriate to facilitate continued operation.
    Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Municipal People's Government, pointed out in his report on the current economic situation in Tianjin that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have created many conditions favorable to national construction. We should consolidate these achievements to make our economy more prosperous and production more developed. He said that in terms of urban-rural exchange and internal and external exchange, it is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles will further expand their business scope, universally restore and develop past trade relations and professional groups, and make the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and internally and externally more active. In this regard, as long as we work together, we can put Tianjin's economy on a healthier and more prosperous path. At the same time, certain temporary phenomena of sluggish sales of finished products and lack of raw materials will be quickly resolved. In terms of public-private relations, because the standards for processing orders and procurement have problems with the old ones, the new ones have not yet been formulated, and some staff members have developed an abnormal emotion of not daring to take responsibility after the "Three-Anti," some phenomena of excessive specifications, complicated procedures, and excessive demands have arisen in processing orders, taxation, and loans. In this regard, the government will give as much consideration as possible within a reasonable and legal scope regarding the issue of processing orders, relax the specifications and profit margins, try to purchase products, and help the capital turnover of industry and commerce; however, if there is a continued recurrence of the "five poisons," that is absolutely not allowed. Regarding the issue of loans, we will find ways to extend the term, simplify the procedures, etc., to achieve the goal of large-scale investment to support the recovery and development of industry and commerce. Regarding the issue of taxation, we will act in accordance with the tax law, and tax evasion and avoidance will not be allowed; at the same time, we must be fair and reasonable in a practical and realistic spirit, and the date of levy will be postponed a little to take into account the temporary difficulties of the industrial and commercial circles. Regarding the issue of labor-capital relations, the government will, on the one hand, educate workers to correctly realize leadership and supervision in accordance with the Common Program, and on the other hand, also hope that people in the industrial and commercial circles will recognize the significance of labor-capital unity in promoting production, properly exercise the rights of business management, financial control, and personnel allocation, and work together to develop production and guide the entire economy to a healthier and more prosperous path.
    After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved the above three reports. During the discussion, members of the Municipal People's Government and members of the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference Li Zhuchen, Zhu Jisheng, Bi Mingqi, Huo Peixiu, Tan Zhiqing, Wang Guangying, Sun Bingru, Fan Shuzhen, Cui Yulan, Bian Jieqing, Liu Huapu, Dong Shaochen, Pan Changyou and others spoke successively, unanimously believing that they had received a great education in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. They all believe that after the conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, industry and commerce should rapidly restore normal production and operation and develop it in a more prosperous direction to welcome the country's large-scale construction. In their speeches, they also put forward sincere and valuable opinions on issues in future public-private and labor-capital relations.
    Finally, Mayor Huang Jing made a concluding speech. He pointed out that after the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, there were relatively few problems, and it could quickly turn to normal work; after the end of the "Five-Anti" movement, there were more problems that needed to be solved. He said: "The purpose of the 'Five-Anti' movement is to develop the national economic cause and to smoothly carry out large-scale economic construction. Therefore, at the end of this movement, we must take care of the economic consequences. To this end, we must strive to be consistent with the actual situation in the verification, determination of cases, refund, and supplementary tax issues in order to take care of the development of industry and commerce. The verification should be consistent with the actual situation and calculated correctly; the determination of cases should be mainly based on political performance (including the attitude in the movement and the circumstances of the illegal acts) and the role in the national economy, and should not be based solely on the amount of illegal income. Based on such principles, some industrial and commercial households with slightly larger amounts of illegal activities, but politically very progressive, or economically more important, or technically contributing to the country, can also be classified as law-abiding or basically law-abiding households. Similarly, the deadline for paying back the tax refunds and supplementary taxes is also given as much consideration as possible. Except for individual cases, the general ones can be extended to after December of this year. If the amount of the refund is large enough to affect continued operation, other methods can also be adopted to resolve it and continue operation. These fully illustrate that the "Five-Anti" movement is not for anything else, but entirely for the development of production. Subsequently, Huang Jing also gave detailed explanations on specific issues such as product specifications and cost calculation in public-private relations after the "Five-Anti" movement, and profit distribution in labor-capital relations, the exercise of business management rights, financial control rights, and personnel allocation rights by the capitalists.
    Huang Jing finally pointed out that if the above tasks are done well, some of the temporary side effects produced in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements will be immediately eliminated, and private industry and commerce will develop more prosperously on a more sound foundation. Therefore, he hopes that people in the industrial and commercial circles will eliminate various unnecessary concerns, actively get involved, work together, do a good job in production and operation, and strive for the further improvement and prosperity of Tianjin's economic situation.

    天津市“三反”“五反”运动胜利结束
    天津市人民政府委员会和市各界人民代表会议协商委员会在五日举行的联席会议，宣告“三反”和“五反”运动在全市范围内胜利结束，并决定在“三反”“五反”运动的胜利基础上，建立新的公私关系和劳资关系，积极发展生产，繁荣经济，把全市的经济引向更健康更繁荣的道路上去。
    黄敬市长在会中首先概括地说明了目前天津市的全面情况。他指出：全市的“三反”“五反”运动基本上已经胜利结束。这一运动收获是很大的，揭发并且清除了“三害”和“五毒”，打退了不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻，为国家建设创造了新的有利条件。但在运动结束时，必须同时注意伴随运动而产生的一时的不正常的现象，使之正常起来。在“三反”方面，除了某些单位的一些错误判断和方式上的生硬等均已及时予以纠正之外，在运动中，经济工作人员受到了深刻的教育，因而对于经管财物都谨慎起来，这当然是好的，但有失之过苛的地方，目前正在积极进行教育，予以解决。在“五反”方面，劳资关系及公私关系上也曾发生一些动荡，如某些职工店员和工作人员对于资本家监督面过宽、要求过高等等，在工商界方面也有不少人产生一些错觉和消极情绪，不敢积极经营，这些也都是正在解决和需要继续解决的问题。但是总的说来，这一运动的收获是伟大的，成绩是主要的，上面所说的这些副作用还是少数的，个别的，而且是暂时的。今年麦子丰收，秋收亦极有望。因此，只有我们的整个经济机构，从各方面都进一步开动起来，才能适应这一即将到来的繁荣局面。所以，如何胜利地结束“三反”“五反”运动，把各种经济关系加以调整，克服某些不正常的现象，这就是我们目前所要做的事情。
    市节约检查委员会秘书长张逢时报告了天津市“三反”运动的结束和处理工作。他说：天津市的“三反”运动，从三月下半月即开始进入处理阶段。在四月中旬，一般单位的打“虎”工作已告结束，全面转入处理工作。截至目前，除少数单位尚需十天左右可以全部处理完毕外，一半以上的单位已经全面结束。张逢时指出：全市“三反”运动进行五个多月以来，获得了很大成绩。通过这一运动，国家工作人员和广大人民群众普遍受到深刻的教育，政治觉悟大大提高了一步。国家工作人员的廉洁、朴素、为人民服务的革命工作作风进一步巩固地树立起来，他们和广大人民普遍地增强了爱护国家财产的责任心。在运动中，很多国家工作人员深深地感到了过去对于贪污、盗窃行为的麻痹而提高了警惕性。同时，很多机关、企业发现了在组织、制度等方面的缺点和漏洞。这些都为今后工作的改进提供了充分有利的条件。关于处理工作，张逢时指出：除了对于极少数拒不坦白、不肯悔过并且罪大恶极的分子给予从重处理，并且清除出政府机关和企业以外，对于绝大多数自动坦白的贪污分子都给予宽大处理，争取他们立功赎罪、重新做人，将来成为良好的工作人员。这样的处理，充分地体现了人民政府“严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合”的方针。
    市节约检查委员会委员吴砚农在关于“五反”运动的报告中说：天津市的“五反”运动，历时五个月，现已基本上胜利结束。守法、基本守法和半守法半违法的工商户已经宣布了结论，处理完毕；严重违法和完全违法的工商户也已处理了四百多户，最近即将全部宣布处理结果。吴砚农说：市节约检查委员会为了妥善地结束“五反”运动，使得定案和处理工作做得正确，最近曾将半守法半违法、严重违法和完全违法的工商户的案件，全部进行了一次认真的审查；本着“斗争从严，处理从宽”的原则，核实定案。在核算工商户的违法所得数字时，务求合乎实际；定案的标准，不仅根据违法所得的数字，更重要的是要考虑工商户在政治上的一贯表现和在经济建设上的作用以及“五反”运动中的态度、违法情节等，然后分别进行处理。关于违法工商户退款补税的交款办法，吴砚农说明：为了避免工商业的生产经营和资金周转发生某些困难，照顾目前工商户正在缴纳一九五一年的所得税，所以除对个别严重违法户和完全违法户限期清缴外，一般的工商户退补款项的期限可以适当延至本年十二月以后开始退补；个别退款数目较大的，还可酌情采用其他方法解决，以利继续经营。
    市人民政府财政经济委员会副主任李耕涛在报告目前天津市的经济情况时，首先指出：通过“三反”“五反”运动，创造了很多有利于国家建设的条件。我们应当巩固这些成果，使我们的经济更繁荣，生产更发展。他说：在城乡交流和内外交流方面，希望工商业界更进一步广泛地开展业务，把过去的贸易关系和专业小组普遍恢复和发展起来，使得城乡和内外的物资交流更加活跃。在这方面，只要我们一致努力，就可使我们天津市的经济走上更加健康更加繁荣的道路，同时，某些成品滞销、原料缺乏的暂时现象，也就会迅速得到解决。在公私关系方面，由于加工定货和收购的标准旧的发生了问题，新的还没有订出来，以及某些工作人员在“三反”以后产生了不敢负责的不正常的情绪，在加工定货、税收、贷款等方面产生了一些规格过严、手续繁杂以及要求过高的现象。在这方面，关于加工定货的问题，政府决在合理合法的范围之内，尽量给予照顾，放宽规格和利润的尺度，尽量收购产品，帮助工商业资金的周转；但是，如有继续犯“五毒”的情形，那是绝不容许的。关于贷款问题，决设法放长期限、简化手续等，达到大量投放的目的，以扶植工商业的恢复和发展。关于税收问题，决按税法办事，不允许再有偷税漏税现象；同时，一定以实事求是的精神做到公平合理，开征日期决向后推延一些，以照顾工商业界的某些暂时困难。关于劳资关系问题，政府决一方面教育工人正确地按照共同纲领实现领导和监督，一方面也希望工商界人士认清劳资团结搞好生产的意义，恰当地运用经营管理、财务支配和人事调配的权利，共同努力发展生产，把整个经济引向更加健康和繁荣的道路上去。
    会议在进行讨论后，一致同意以上三个报告。讨论时，市人民政府委员和市各界人民协商委员李烛尘、朱继圣、毕鸣岐、霍培修、谭志清、王光英、孙冰如、范淑贞、崔毓兰、边洁清、刘华圃、董少臣、潘长有等先后发言，一致认为自己在“三反”“五反”运动中受到了很大教育。他们都认为在结束“三反”“五反”运动之后，工商业应该急速恢复正常的生产和经营，并使之向更繁荣的道路发展，迎接国家的大规模建设。他们在发言中还分别对今后的公私关系和劳资关系中的问题，提出了诚恳而宝贵的意见。
    最后由黄敬市长作总结发言。他指出：“三反”运动结束以后，问题比较少，很快即可转向正常的工作；“五反”运动结束后，需要解决的问题是比较多的。他说：“五反”运动的目的是为了发展国家经济事业，为了顺利地进行大规模经济建设。因此，在结束这一运动时，一定要照顾经济后果。为此，在核实、定案、退款、补税等问题上，一定要力求合乎实际情况，以照顾工商业的发展。核实时务求合乎实际，计算得正确；定案时应主要根据政治上的表现（包括在运动中的态度和违法情节）及对国家经济上的作用，不应单纯根据违法所得的数字。根据这样的原则来定案，就使得一些违法数字虽然稍大，但政治上很进步，或经济上作用较大，或技术上对国家有贡献的工商业户，也可列为守法或基本守法户。同样在退款补税的交款期限上，也尽量予以照顾，除个别的以外，一般的可以延展到今年十二月以后缴纳。如因退款数目较大将影响继续经营的，还可采取其他方法解决，继续经营。这些都充分说明了开展“五反”运动并不是为了别的，而完全是为了发展生产。随后，黄敬并对“五反”运动后公私关系中的产品规格、成本计算，劳资关系中的利润分配，资方行使经营管理权、财务支配权、人事调配权等具体问题，作了详尽的解释。
    黄敬最后指出：做好以上这几项工作，“三反”“五反”运动中所产生的某些暂时的副作用，就会立即消除，私营工商业就会在更健全的基础上更加繁荣地发展起来。因此，他希望工商业界人士消除各种不必要的顾虑，积极起来，共同努力，搞好生产和经营，为天津市经济情况的更加好转和繁荣而努力。  （新华社）
