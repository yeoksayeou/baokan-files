To the Editor:

    Lingdi Village's Wu Dun Dam in Lingdi Township, Guangfeng County, Jiangxi, is the main dam in the township, 42 zhang long, and its stored water can irrigate more than 80 mu of farmland. However, this dam has been down for nearly 20 years. In May last year, Zhou Xiaofang, the responsible cadre of Lingdi Township, accepted instructions from higher authorities to build water conservancy projects and led the masses to repair the dam. However, due to the lack of proper design, the dam was washed down three times in a row by heavy floods from May to August after it was repaired. After three repairs, a total of more than 500 man-days were spent. Because the dam repairs were carried out during the busy farming season, farmers' production was delayed. Last year, Lingdi Village's rice harvest was 10,000 jin less than the previous year. This year, one-third of the dam has been washed down again by heavy floods. When the masses talk about repairing the dam, they shake their heads and sigh.

    Building water conservancy projects to increase production is a good thing, and the masses of farmers also welcome it. However, Zhou Xiaofang, the leading cadre of Lingdi Township, made a mistake in leading the repair of the Wu Dun Dam, which made the local farmers lose confidence in building water conservancy projects. This matter should arouse the vigilance of comrades everywhere who are leading the construction of water conservancy projects. Zhan Zhaoxiong

### 江西省广丰县岭底乡  修坝时没有很好设计屡次返工

    江西省广丰县岭底乡
    修坝时没有很好设计屡次返工
    编辑同志：江西广丰县岭底乡岭底村的吴墩坝是全乡主要的堤坝，长四十二丈，坝内储水可灌田八十余亩。但这条坝倒了已近二十年了。去年五月间，岭底乡的负责干部周筱舫接受了上级兴修水利的指示，就领导群众修理这条坝。但由于没有进行很好设计，以致这条坝修好以后，由五月到八月，被大水连着冲倒三次。经过三次修补，共用去五百多个人工。由于修坝都是在农忙时间进行，所以耽误了农民的生产。去年岭底村的稻谷收成比前年减少一万斤。今年这条坝又被大水冲倒了三分之一。群众一谈到修这条坝，就摇头叹气。
    兴修水利能增加生产，本是好事，农民群众也很欢迎。但是岭底乡领导干部周筱舫在领导修理吴墩坝上犯了错误，就使当地农民对兴修水利失去了信心。这件事应该引起各地领导兴修水利工程的同志的警惕。 詹兆雄
