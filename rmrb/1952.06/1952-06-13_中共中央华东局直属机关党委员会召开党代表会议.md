Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. In order to consolidate the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement and improve democratic life within the Party, the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau recently convened a Party Representative Meeting. The meeting lasted three days, with a total of 286 attendees and observers.

    Tan Zhenlin, a responsible comrade of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, delivered a political report at the meeting. He first pointed out: "The 'Three-Anti' movement is the best and most powerful democratic reform movement within our Party. It has promoted the democratic spirit within our Party and exposed errors in the thinking and actions of some Party members. This has played an extremely important role in consolidating the Party's organization, improving democratic life, raising the political level of Party members, and strengthening the Party's leadership over the country." Tan Zhenlin then pointed out: "The Party Representative Meeting is an extremely important method in our Party life. Since its birth, the Chinese Communist Party has been in an extremely tense state of war, making it impossible for us to carry out Party work entirely in a normal manner. Now, we are fully capable of further building the Party's regular democratic life in a normal manner." He said: Through this Party Representative Meeting, the spirit of democratic centralism within the Party should be implemented in the lives of branches and groups, as well as in various organizations, so that every Communist Party member can improve in this regard. After recounting the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement, Tan Zhenlin called on everyone to build on the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, work hard on economic construction and professional construction. Currently, it is necessary to do a good job in production and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. We must strive to continue to achieve the task proposed by Comrade Rao Shushi of all state-owned, public-owned, and joint state-private factories, mines, and financial enterprises in East China increasing production and saving 35,000 billion yuan in wealth for the country in 1952.

    Wei Wenbo, Secretary-General of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, also delivered a summary report on the "Three-Anti" movement in the directly subordinate organs at the meeting.

    The meeting commended twenty outstanding organ workers, including Wang Fuyuan, Liu Zhong, Chen Jian, and Lu Muzhen, including twelve Communist Party members and three members of the New Democratic Youth League. These outstanding workers were selected by various branches, and their exemplary deeds were recognized by everyone, sharing the common characteristics of diligence, simplicity, devotion to duty, willingness to bear hardships, and dedication to hard work. They have a firm stance and have always maintained a hard-working and simple style since entering Shanghai. The representatives at the meeting were moved by their exemplary deeds and suggested that the leading organs compile these materials into a book to educate everyone.

    The meeting elected the Party Committee of the Directly Subordinate Organs of the East China Bureau and handled 417 proposals submitted by various branches. These proposals raised many issues and suggestions, which are of great help for future work.

    The meeting adopted five resolutions: 1. Systematically carry out ideological education to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement among cadres in the organs, further draw a clear line of demarcation in thinking, and correctly understand the duality of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the Party's policy towards the bourgeoisie. 2. Strengthen ideological and political leadership, strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and regularly conduct current affairs and policy education; combine administrative work and strengthen professional learning. Strengthen cultural learning among workers, peasants, cadres, and public service personnel. 3. Improve the Party committee system, implement the system of collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility, fully promote democracy, and improve democratic life within the Party. 4.
