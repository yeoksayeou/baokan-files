    The Morning at Taipingkou Construction Site
    Hai Bo, Li Zhi

    On the morning of June 3rd, at the Taipingkou construction site on the south bank of Jingjiang, 80,000 workers were building China's largest water gate – the Taipingkou Inflow Gate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Once the entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is completed, 5.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater from the Yangtze River will flow into the flood storage area through this gate.

    This was a morning of the forty-sixth day of intense construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. When the warm sunshine touched the construction site, the huge gate of the Taipingkou Inflow Gate, freshly painted with red oil, had spread its two wings outwards, marking that the gate's more than 80,000 cubic meters of concrete work had been basically completed, and the focus of the project had shifted to installing the gate. This giant water gate, 1,054 meters long, stands facing the Yangtze River and the mouth of the Hudu River. The floodwaters rushing out of the treacherous Three Gorges will be subdued here. The happy lives of millions of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River will be guaranteed from now on.

    In the morning, the Taipingkou construction site appeared particularly beautiful. Look! Thousands of sailboats, steamers, and landing craft on the Yangtze River are working hard to transport materials for the project. Workers are operating giant cranes transported from Leningrad to gently install the gate arm on the pier. The shovels and spades of soldiers and civilians digging earth flashed in the morning sun...

    For the construction of the motherland, the people here love every job and dedicate their wisdom and creativity. Everyone is launching a fiery labor competition with the attitude of being the masters of the country. Metalworkers Wang Xuefu and Wang Youcai, two brothers, competed to participate in this project. They created a reasonable division of labor method, increasing the work efficiency of riveting gate nails from 300 per person per day to 700 to 1,200. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which had shed blood and performed meritorious service in revolutionary wars in the past, participated in the project in tens of thousands. Their will for the peaceful construction of the motherland is as strong as annihilating the enemy. More than 4,000 people have learned the technology of operating cement mixers in a short period of time and have become the main force in the project. They said: "We want to be heroes on the battlefield and models in construction."

    Yesterday, people had completed the upstream and downstream sea embankment projects. On the morning of June 3rd, people were throwing riprap into the anti-scour trough. This is a unique and important design by Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov based on the specific conditions of the inflow gate, hence it is named "Bukov Trough." The people here are infinitely grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of the great friend, the Soviet Union, to the Chinese people and this project. On this beautiful morning, songs praising Stalin flew everywhere.

    The engineering daily report of June 3rd stated: The entire Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been 74 percent completed. This marks that the struggle of 300,000 people against the flood has achieved a decisive victory, and the project can be completed before the high-water season. On May 24th, Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, came to the construction site to present banners and condolences to the 300,000 people. The banner bore Chairman Mao's inscription: "Strive for the victory of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project for the benefit of the broad masses of the people." Now, the 80,000 laborers at the Taipingkou Inflow Gate construction site are pushing the patriotic labor competition to a new climax for their own eternal happiness.

    People sincerely thank the great leader for the happiness he has given them. The song of praise to Mao Zedong rises slowly with the sun, becoming louder and louder. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, people are advancing towards new victories.

    太平口工地的早晨
    海波、黎之
    六月三日的早晨，在荆江南岸太平口工地上，八万员工正在建设着我国最大的一座水闸——荆江分洪工程太平口进洪闸。待整个荆江分洪工程修成后，长江内将有五十五亿立方公尺的洪水从该闸流入蓄洪区。
    这是荆江分洪工程紧张施工的第四十六天的一个早晨，当和煦的阳光抹上工地的时候，太平口进洪闸上，刚涂上红油的巨大闸门，已展开了两翼向外扩展着，它标志着该闸八万多方混凝土工程已基本完成，工程重点已转到安装闸门。这座一千零五十四公尺长的巨型水闸，它面对着长江、虎渡河口屹立着。从险峻三峡冲出的洪水，将在这里就范。荆江两岸千百万人民的幸福生活，将从此得到保障。
    早上，太平口工地显得分外的美丽。看吧！长江上成千只帆船、汽船、登陆艇都紧张地为工程赶运器材。工人驾驶着从列宁格勒运来的巨型起重机将闸门支臂，轻轻安在闸墩上。军工、民工挖土的铁锨洋锹在朝阳里挥动得闪光……。
    为了祖国的建设，这里的人们热爱着每一件工作，献出了自己的智慧和创造，大家都以国家主人翁的姿态展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。五金工人王学富，王有才弟兄两个争着参加了这个工程，他们创造了合理分工的工作方法，将铆闸门钉的工作效率，由每人每日三百个提高到七百至一千二百个。过去曾在革命战争中流过血立过功的中国人民解放军，成万地参加了工程，他们为祖国和平建设的意志像消灭敌人一样的坚强，已有四千多人在短期内学会了操纵洋灰拌合机的技术，成了工程中的主力。他们说：“我们要在战场上当英雄，建设中当模范。”
    昨天，人们已将上、下游海漫工程作好，六月三日的清晨人们正将块石抛入防冲漕。这是苏联水利专家布可夫同志，根据进洪闸具体情况，特有的重要设计，因此命名为“布可夫漕”。这里的人们无限地感谢着伟大的朋友苏联对中国人民和这个工程的热情援助。在这个美丽的早晨，歌颂斯大林的歌声四处飞扬。
    六月三日的工程日报表上载着：整个荆江分洪工程已完成百分之七十四。这就标志着：三十万人和洪水的斗争已取得决定性的胜利，大汛前即可全部完成工程。五月二十四日中央人民政府水利部部长傅作义来工地给三十万人授旗和慰问，旗上是毛主席亲笔题辞：“为广大人民的利益，争取荆江分洪工程的胜利”。现在，太平口进洪闸工地上的八万民工，为了自己永远的幸福，又将爱国主义劳动竞赛推向更高潮。
    人们衷心地感谢着伟大的领袖给予他们的幸福，毛泽东颂的歌声随着太阳徐徐上升，越唱越响亮。人们在毛泽东的旗帜下，正向新的胜利前进。
