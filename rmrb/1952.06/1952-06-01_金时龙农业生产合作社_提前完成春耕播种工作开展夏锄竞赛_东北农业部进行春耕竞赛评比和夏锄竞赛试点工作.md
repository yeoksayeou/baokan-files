The Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanji County, Jilin Province, which jointly launched a challenge in the national patriotic production increase competition, completed its spring planting competition plan ahead of schedule and expanded the organization of the cooperative during the spring planting period. The cooperative is now launching a summer weeding competition. The dryland crops of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative, such as soybeans, millet, and sorghum, have all been planted, ten days ahead of the original plan and half a month ahead of previous years. Rice transplanting was also done a week earlier than in previous years. Due to the application of more fertilizer to both paddy and dry fields, and the use of high-quality varieties suitable for local soil and climate, which had been tested for germination, the emerging seedlings are growing uniformly and vigorously.

During this year's patriotic production increase competition, the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative created and piloted a "labor self-reporting system," which made the use of manpower in the cooperative more rational. The so-called "labor self-reporting system" involves careful calculation of the manpower required for various tasks from spring plowing to summer weeding, with each member self-reporting the number of labor days they can participate in during this period. This is then reviewed and approved by all members to formulate a labor plan with fixed time, quantity, and quality, which is then implemented. During spring plowing, the cooperative allocated manpower according to the established labor plan, ensuring that all ninety-plus able-bodied members had work to do every day. The previous phenomenon of individual members absenting themselves from work or arriving late and leaving early no longer occurred after the implementation of the "labor self-reporting system." All members took pride in participating in more labor days. All five production teams in the cooperative conducted daily competitions between teams and individuals, and supported each other. This ensured the early completion of the planting plan. Because the cooperative demonstrated the superiority of collective production, many farmers voluntarily joined the cooperative. Following the voluntary merger of all farmers from the Cui Tailie Agricultural Production Cooperative, six more individual farming households voluntarily joined the cooperative. As a result, the cooperative increased from the original twenty-two households to forty-seven households; the members also contributed all twenty-three head of cattle as shares and raised them collectively, overcoming the contradictions of unified allocation and scattered feeding of draught animals in the past. The cooperative now has more than twice as much labor, livestock, and cultivated land as before. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, the agricultural production cooperative also signed a supply and marketing contract with the village's supply and marketing cooperative. They hand over the produced grain, pigs, eggs, and other agricultural and sideline products to the supply and marketing cooperative for sales and promptly obtain agricultural tools, fertilizers, and other means of production and daily necessities from the supply and marketing cooperative. In this way, all members can concentrate all their efforts on participating in production. Due to the unprecedented increase in the labor enthusiasm of all members and the unleashing of potential, and the significant improvement in farming techniques, the cooperative's production increase plan has also been continuously improved. The planned yield of the main crop, rice, is 11,000 catties per hectare (fifteen mu), an increase of 500 catties compared to the original plan and 84% higher than the usual yield. The planned yields of soybeans and sorghum have increased by about 10% compared to the original plan.

After completing the planting, the cooperative held a general meeting of all members to evaluate and commend those with good work attitudes, greatly encouraging the members' enthusiasm for labor. Now, the whole cooperative has launched a summer weeding competition, and the first weeding of crops such as wheat, barley, and millet has been completed. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency. The Northeast People's Government's Agricultural Department dispatched three working groups on May 21 to Nehe in Heilongjiang, Shulan in Jilin Province, and Yixian in Liaoxi Province to conduct pilot work on spring plowing competition evaluation and the launch of summer weeding competition. This year's spring plowing competition evaluation is centered on whether the unit area yield can be increased. The content includes whether the spring plowing competition plan to increase fertilization and improve farming techniques has been completed and the experience of completing the plan, how mutual aid and cooperation organizations reasonably use labor and the experience of leading the competition. Summarizing these experiences in order to promote the summer weeding competition.

The spring sowing in Northeast China will basically end by the end of May. At present, rural areas in various places have successively begun to hoe the fields. The first weeding has been generally carried out in the counties in southern Manchuria and the fourteen counties including Bayan and Nehe in Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces in northern Manchuria. In Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, many farmers began weeding wheat fields as early as May 1st. The Yang Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, has made a summer weeding plan. The forty hectares of wheat land are contracted for weeding by male and female members separately, and weeding started on May 10th, with a plan to complete the first weeding of the fields by the end of the month. Farmers in Songtun Village, Gaiping County, and Youliang Village, Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, are actively preparing fertilizers in conjunction with weeding, in preparation for topdressing.

    提前完成春耕播种工作开展夏锄竞赛
    东北农业部进行春耕竞赛评比和夏锄竞赛试点工作
    参加全国爱国增产竞赛联名挑战的吉林省延吉县金时龙农业生产合作社，提前完成了春耕播种竞赛计划，并在春耕播种期间扩大了社的组织。目前该社正展开夏锄竞赛。金时龙农业生产合作社的旱田作物如大豆、谷子和高粱等都已种完，比预定计划提前了十天、比往年提前了半个月。水稻插秧也比往年提早了一个星期。由于水、旱田施肥多，各种作物都是采用适于当地土质和气候的优良品种，作过发芽试验，现在出土的禾苗长得又齐又壮。
    金时龙农业生产合作社在今年爱国增产竞赛中，创造并试用了“劳动自报制”，使全社人力的使用更加合理。所谓“劳动自报制”，是先精打细算，把从春耕到夏锄期间的各种工作所需的人力都计算出来，由每个社员自报在此期间能够参加的劳动日数，再经过全体社员评议通过，制订出定时、定量、定质的劳动计划，然后实施。春耕中，该社就按既定的劳动计划支配人力，使全社九十多个能劳动的社员，人人天天都有活干。从前个别社员的随便旷工和迟到早退，在实行“劳动自报制”后便不再发生了。所有社员都以多参加劳动日为光荣。全社五个生产组，每天都在开展着组与组、人与人之间的比赛，并互相支援。这便保证了播种计划的提前完成。由于该社显示出了集体主义生产的优越性，许多农民便自动地加入合作社了。继崔泰烈农业生产合作社全体农民自愿和该社合并后，又有六户个体农民自愿加入了该社。这样，该社就由原来的二十二户增至四十七户；社员们又把二十三头耕牛，全部入股，集体饲养，克服了过去耕畜统一调用和分散饲养的矛盾。现全社所拥有的劳动力、畜力和耕地，都比原来增加一倍多。为了保证增产计划的实现，农业生产合作社又与本村供销合作社签订了供销合同。他们将生产的粮食、猪、鸡蛋等农、副产品，交由供销合作社推销，并及时从供销合作社取得农具、肥料等生产资料和日用品。这样全体社员便能集中全力参加生产。由于全体社员劳动热情空前提高，潜在力得到了发挥，耕作技术有了显著改进，因而该社增产计划也不断提高。主要作物水稻每垧（十五市亩）计划产量达一万一千斤。比原订计划增加五百斤，比常年产量高百分之八十四。大豆和高粱的计划产量，都比原订计划增加百分之十左右。
    该社在完成播种后，曾举行了全体社员评比大会，对于劳动态度好的，给予表扬和奖励，大大地鼓舞起社员们的劳动热情。现在全社已展开了夏锄竞赛，小麦、大麦和谷子等作物，都完成了头遍锄草。（新华社）
    东北人民政府农业部已于五月二十一日派出三个工作组，分赴黑龙江的讷河，吉林省的舒兰和辽西省的义县，进行春耕竞赛评比和开展夏锄竞赛的试点工作，今年的春耕竞赛评比，是以能否提高单位面积产量为中心。其内容包括多施肥和改进耕作技术的春耕竞赛计划是否完成和完成计划的经验，互助合作组织如何合理使用劳动力和领导竞赛的经验。总结这些经验，以便推动夏锄竞赛。
    东北各地的春耕播种在五月末即可基本结束。目前各地农村已相继开铲大田。南满各县和北满松江、黑龙江、吉林三省的巴彦、讷河等十四个县已普遍铲了第一遍。辽西省新民县很多农民在五月一日就已开始铲麦田的杂草。黑龙江省克山县杨显亭农业生产合作社作出了夏锄计划，四十垧小麦地由男女社员分别包铲，已于五月十日开锄，计划至月末完成大田头遍铲趟。辽东省盖平县松屯村和岫岩县有良村农民正结合铲趟积极准备肥料，以备追肥。（新华社）
