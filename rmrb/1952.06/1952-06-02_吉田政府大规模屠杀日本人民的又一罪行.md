    Another Crime of the Yoshida Government: Massacring the Japanese People on a Large Scale

    The Yoshida government's hatred and atrocities against the patriotic Japanese people are becoming increasingly cruel and shameless. The bloodstains of the "May Day" tragedy have not yet dried, and the Yoshida government, under the direction of the American occupiers, once again carried out a frenzied beating, shooting, and arrest of patriotic masses who held demonstrations and parades throughout Japan on May 30. According to the confession of the Tokyo police authorities, in this tragedy, in Tokyo alone, three parading people were killed, dozens were injured, and thirty-five were arrested; according to the Japanese National Rural Police Headquarters, as of the evening of the 30th, a total of 103 parading people had been arrested throughout Japan. This is another serious crime of the Yoshida government in large-scale arrest and killing of patriotic Japanese people.
    The May 30th demonstrations and parades fully demonstrated the unyielding fighting spirit of the Japanese people in resolutely opposing American occupation and fascist rule. Since April of this year, the Japanese people have held two nationwide strikes and a massive May Day demonstration, strongly expressing their unwavering determination to strive for independence and freedom. The US-Japanese reactionaries carried out despicable divisive conspiracies against the heroic struggle of the Japanese people. After the failure of this conspiracy, they carried out bloody massacres, but all this not only failed to scare the Japanese people, but on the contrary, the Japanese people were united more strongly, and the struggle was more heroic. The May 30th demonstration was held simultaneously in sixty-two locations across the country under the severe oppression of the Yoshida government. This fully demonstrates that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people is unstoppable.
        After the "May Day" tragedy, the Yoshida government has continuously arrested more than 900 patriotic Japanese people, and regardless of the firm opposition of the Japanese people, on May 15, it forcibly passed fascist bills such as the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" in the Japanese House of Representatives in order to further strengthen fascist rule. In order to suppress the Japanese people's demonstration on May 30, the Yoshida government convened an "emergency security conference" on May 28, ordered the country to "strengthen defenses," and mobilized more than 20,000 policemen to "lay down an emergency alert." People can see how crazy the Yoshida government's hatred is towards the patriotic Japanese people. But madness does not produce strength; the Yoshida government's crazy actions in trying to suppress the Japanese people's patriotic movement with police and bayonets are enough to show that its rule is very fragile.
    The patriotic actions of the Japanese people are worthy of admiration. Their struggle will surely achieve final victory. The Yoshida government must immediately stop the bloody atrocities, otherwise it will surely be resolutely opposed by the Japanese people and peace-loving people all over the world.

    吉田政府大规模屠杀日本人民的又一罪行
    日本吉田政府对日本爱国人民的仇视和暴行越来越凶残无耻了。“五一”惨案的血迹未干，而吉田政府竟又在美国占领者的指使下于五月三十日对日本全国各地举行示威游行的爱国群众施行疯狂的殴打、枪杀和逮捕。据东京警察当局的供认，在这次惨案中，仅东京游行群众即被打死三人，打伤数十人，并有三十五人被捕；据日本国家地方警察本部供认，截至三十日晚间全日本各地被逮捕的游行群众已达一百零三人。这是吉田政府又一次大规模捕杀日本爱国人民的严重罪行。
    五月三十日的示威游行充分表现了日本人民坚决反对美国占领和法西斯统治的不屈不挠的斗争精神。自今年四月以来，日本人民已举行了两次全国规模的大罢工和五一节的声势浩大的示威游行，强烈地表现了他们争取独立自由的不可动摇的意志。美日反动派对日本人民的英勇斗争，曾施行卑鄙的分化阴谋，在这阴谋失败之后又进行了血腥屠杀，但这一切都不但没有吓倒日本人民，相反的，日本人民却团结得更为坚强了，斗争也更为英勇了。五月三十日的示威是在吉田政府严重压迫之下在全国六十二处同时举行的。这充分地说明了日本人民的英勇斗争是不可抑止的。
        在“五一”惨案之后，吉田政府已连续逮捕日本爱国人民达九百余人，并且不顾日本人民的坚决反对于五月十五日强迫日本众议院通过了“防止破坏活动法案”等法西斯法案，以便进一步加强法西斯统治。为了镇压五月三十日的日本人民的示威游行，吉田政府更于五月二十八日召开了“紧急治安会议”，命令全国“严加防备”，并动员了二万多名警察，“布下紧急戒备的阵势”。人们可以看出：吉田政府对日本爱国人民是怀着何等疯狂的仇恨。但是疯狂并不产生力量；吉田政府力图以警察和刺刀镇压日本人民爱国运动的疯狂行动，适足以说明它的统治是十分脆弱的。
    日本人民的爱国行动是值得钦敬的。他们的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。吉田政府必须立即停止血腥的暴行，否则它必将遭到日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对。
