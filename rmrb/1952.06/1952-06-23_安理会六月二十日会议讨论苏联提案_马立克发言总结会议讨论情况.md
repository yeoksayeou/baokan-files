Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 22nd: The United Nations Security Council held two meetings on June 20th to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal to call on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons. At the morning meeting, the representatives of Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Turkey spoke.

At the afternoon meeting, U.S. Representative Gross spoke, reiterating Truman's argument that the Geneva Protocol was "outdated" and continued to advocate referring the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. While Gross claimed that the Geneva Protocol was "outdated," he stated that the United States intended to resolve the issue of bacteriological weapons through a so-called "universal disarmament plan." However, everyone knows that the U.S. plan does not provide for genuine disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, nor does it provide for the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. Gross tried every means to deny the fact that the U.S. aggressor troops used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. He said that the U.S. delegation would request the Security Council to ask the International Committee of the Red Cross to investigate the matter. After the U.S. representative spoke, Soviet Representative Malik then spoke, summarizing the discussions of the Security Council meeting on June 20th. The meeting adjourned at this point. The next meeting is scheduled for June 23rd.

    安理会六月二十日会议讨论苏联提案
    马立克发言总结会议讨论情况
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：六月二十日，联合国安全理事会举行了两次会议，讨论苏联代表团提出的关于号召各国参加并批准一九二五年禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的问题。在上午会议上，有英国、希腊、荷兰、巴西和土耳其的代表发言。
    在下午会议上，美国代表葛罗斯发言，重述杜鲁门所谓日内瓦议定书已经“过时”的论调，并继续主张把苏联这个建议转交给联合国裁减军备委员会处理。葛罗斯一方面说日内瓦议定书已经“过时”，一方面表示，美国的意思是用所谓“普遍裁减军备计划”来解决细菌武器的问题；可是，谁都知道，美国的这个计划既没有规定真正裁减军备和禁止原子武器，也没有规定禁止细菌武器。葛罗斯想尽一切办法，企图否认美国侵略军在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的事实。他说，美国代表团将要求安全理事会请红十字国际委员会调查这件事。美国代表发言之后，苏联代表马立克接着发言，总结六月二十日安理会会议的讨论情况。当天的会议进行至此便告结束。下次会议定于六月二十三日举行。
