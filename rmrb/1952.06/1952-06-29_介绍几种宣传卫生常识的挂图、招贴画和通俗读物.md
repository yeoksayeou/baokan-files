Recently, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House has published eleven kinds of wall charts promoting health knowledge and eleven kinds of posters with the theme of encouraging the masses to participate in the patriotic health movement and thoroughly smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. The People's Publishing House has also recently published five kinds of popular booklets on this subject.

The characteristics of these wall charts, posters, and booklets are: clear themes, easy-to-understand text, and the wall charts and posters, in particular, attract people's interest with their beautiful and vivid colored pictures, thus achieving a better effect of publicity and education. They generally avoid the shortcomings that old health publications easily fall into, such as being detached from reality, profound and difficult to understand, and dry and boring. They are linked to the actual situation of people's daily lives and the urban and rural environment, introducing health science knowledge from all aspects, and specifically demonstrating the interrelationship between health work and the struggle against bacteriological warfare.

In the current opposition to American imperialism's bacteriological warfare and the development of the patriotic health movement, mobilizing the broad masses to eliminate flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, rats, and all other pests that spread bacteria, and constantly maintaining environmental hygiene and personal cleanliness, are the most important and basic tasks. An ordinary person only dislikes a fly for its dirtiness, but "Killing a fly is eliminating an enemy" (poster by Sha Gengsi) clearly demonstrates the political significance of fly eradication.

Several health wall charts on catching and killing flies, mosquitoes, lice, rats, and fleas, scientifically explain the harm these pests do to humans, show how they spread bacteria, and clarify the process of spreading infectious diseases, which can raise people's awareness of the dangers of these pests. The various pest control methods suggested in the above wall charts are also simple, easy to implement, and effective.

Another part of the wall charts is about improving environmental sanitation and personal hygiene habits. "Urban Public Environmental Sanitation" describes the matters that all public places, such as cinemas, theaters, hotels, restaurants, vegetable markets, cold food stores, bathhouses, barbershops, milk farms, and food stalls, should pay attention to and abide by in terms of public health. "Urban Household Environmental Sanitation" focuses on explaining the necessity of cleaning and improving sanitary facilities in residents' kitchens, toilets, indoors, and outdoors. "Rural Environmental Sanitation" depicts practical and easy-to-implement methods for improving rural sanitation. "Must Pay Attention to Personal Hygiene Habits" vividly depicts precautions for personal hygiene habits such as drinking boiled water, boiling bowls and chopsticks, washing hands before meals, getting vaccinations, vaccinations, cutting fingernails, spitting into spittoons, ironing clothes, and airing quilts. Developing these necessary habits is of great benefit to personal health and the improvement of collective environmental sanitation.

"How to Defend Against the Bacteriological Warfare of American Imperialism" depicts the technical knowledge of eliminating poisonous insects and substances spread by enemy planes.
         These wall charts were compiled and drawn by the Propaganda Department of the Central Ministry of Health and the Central Academy of Fine Arts, etc.

Among the eleven kinds of posters, our artists used different images to express the Chinese people's determination and confidence in resolutely crushing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. "Responding to the Motherland's Call, Resolutely Eliminate the Bacteriological Warfare of American Aggressors" by Liu Ji卤 and "Doing a Good Job in Disease Prevention and Hygiene is a Concrete Patriotic Action to Crush the Bacteriological Warfare of American Imperialism" by Zhang Xinmiao depict the brave and resolute image of our medical and health workers and the broad masses standing at the forefront of the anti-bacteriological warfare, carrying out sanitation work together. "Protecting Children, Resolutely Crushing the Bacteriological Warfare of American Imperialism" by Zhang Songhe typifies a mother, and also the deep-seated inner anger of mothers all over the world at the inhumane bacteriological warfare of American aggressors. Several outstanding posters thoroughly expose the ugly faces of Truman and Acheson, the executioners who used bacteriological weapons.

The five kinds of popular booklets are written for different target readers. "Common Knowledge of Disease Prevention" edited by the All-China Medical Association, provides a comprehensive and practical description of all aspects of common knowledge for defending against bacteriological warfare and preventing various infectious diseases. This knowledge is something everyone should understand. This re-edition also adds two articles for propagandists, "Everyone Participate in the Patriotic Disease Prevention and Hygiene Movement" and "Emergency Handling Methods for Defending Against Enemy-Spreading Bacteria-Carrying Insects and Toxic Substances." "Common Knowledge of Rural Disease Prevention" and "Common Knowledge of Preventing and Controlling Infectious Diseases of Livestock" are written in plain language and are accompanied by illustrations, which can help farmers with limited literacy to understand the main points. These two booklets are of great use to farmers. "Common Knowledge of Urban Disease Prevention" focuses on improving urban environmental sanitation. Factories, schools, institutions, shops, households, and public places can refer to the content of this book to improve public health facilities. "Thoroughly Defeat the Bacteriological Warfare of American Imperialism" succinctly describes the evidence of American imperialism's bacteriological warfare in Korea and within our country, and introduces some common knowledge of defending against bacteriological warfare.

How to use these wall charts, posters, and popular booklets?
         1. Local health authorities can order a number of posters and wall charts based on local conditions and post them widely in public places and street corners. Local cultural and educational institutions, libraries, urban district cultural centers, reading rooms, literacy schools, etc. can also post them.
     2. Factories, schools, institutions, mass organizations, and other public places (such as cinemas, theaters, cultural palaces, cooperatives) can post posters or wall charts. Stores can use them to decorate window displays. Propagandists and blackboards in various places can obtain propaganda materials from these pictures and booklets. When necessary, some active members of health work can be organized to conduct appropriate explanations and studies based on the content of the wall charts and booklets.

In order to help with the universal distribution of these wall charts, posters, and popular booklets, the central health department has specially instructed the publisher to reduce the prices of these publications. Xinhua Bookstores in various places should cooperate with local health authorities, do a good job in distribution in a timely and planned manner, and universally distribute these popular health publications among the masses, especially paying attention to contacting the health agencies and propaganda organizations of counties and districts to distribute them to the rural masses. In this way, it will undoubtedly be of great help to the patriotic health movement that is currently being carried out widely and deeply.

    人民美术出版社最近出版了十一种宣传卫生知识的挂图，十一种以鼓动群众参加爱国卫生运动、彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战为主题的招贴画；人民出版社最近也出版了五种有关这方面的通俗小册子。
    这些挂图、招贴画、小册子的特色是：主题明确，文字通俗易懂，而挂图和招贴画，更以其优美鲜明的彩色图画吸引人们的兴趣，因而也较易收到宣传教育的效果。它们一般都避免了旧的卫生读物所容易犯的那些脱离实际、高深难懂、枯燥乏味的缺点，联系了群众的日常生活和城乡环境的实际情况，从各方面介绍了卫生科学知识，把卫生工作和反细菌战斗争的相互关系也具体地表现出来了。
    在当前的反对美帝国主义细菌战、开展爱国卫生运动中，发动广大群众扑灭苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、虱子、老鼠及其他一切传播细菌的害虫，经常保持环境卫生和个人的清洁卫生，是最重要最基本的工作。一只苍蝇，一般人不过嫌恶它的肮脏，但是，“打死一只苍蝇，就是消灭一个敌人”（招贴画，沙更思作）明白地表现了灭蝇行动的政治上的意义。
    关于捕灭苍蝇、蚊子、虱子、老鼠和跳蚤等的几种卫生挂图，把这些害虫对人类的危害作了科学的解释，显示了它们传播细菌、明了了传播疫病的过程，就可以提高人们对这些害虫应有的警惕。上述挂图所提示的各种防虫方法，也是简而易行、行而有效的。
    挂图的另一部分是关于改善环境卫生和个人卫生习惯的。“城市公共环境卫生”描绘了各公共场所，如电影院、剧场、旅馆、饭店、菜市、冷食店、澡堂、理发店、牛奶场、饮食摊等在公共卫生方面应该注意和应该遵守的事项。“城市住户环境卫生”着重说明居民住户的厨房、厕所、室内、室外清洁扫除和改善卫生设备的必要。“乡村环境卫生”描绘了改进农村卫生的切实易行的方法。“必须注意个人卫生习惯”生动地描绘了喝开水，煮碗筷，饭前洗手，打防疫针，种痘，剪指甲，吐痰入盂，烫衣晒被等个人卫生习惯的注意事项。养成这些必要的习惯，对个人健康和集体卫生环境的改善都有很大的益处。
     “怎样防御美帝国主义的细菌战”描绘了扑灭敌机撒布的毒虫毒物的技术知识。
         这些挂图是中央卫生部宣传处和中央美术学院等合作编绘的。
    十一种招贴画中，我们的艺术家以不同的形象表现了中国人民坚决粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的力量和信心。刘继卤作的“响应祖国的号召，坚决消灭美国侵略者的细菌战”，张文新作的“作好防疫卫生工作，就是粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的具体爱国行动”，描绘了站在反细菌战最前线的我们的医务卫生工作者和广大群众在一起，进行卫生工作的勇敢坚定的形象。张松鹤作的“保卫孩子，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战”，典型地描绘了一个母亲，也是全世界的母亲们对于美国侵略者灭绝人性的细菌战的深恶痛绝的内心愤怒。好几幅出色的招贴画，把使用细菌武器的刽子手杜鲁门，艾奇逊的丑恶面目彻底揭穿了。
    五种通俗小册子是根据不同的读者对象而编写的。中华医学会总会编的“防疫常识”，对防御细菌战，防止各种传染病的各方面的常识有概括的切实的叙述，这些常识是人人应该懂得的。这次再版又增加了宣传员讲话“人人都来参加爱国防疫卫生运动”和“防御敌人撒布细菌毒虫毒物的紧急处置办法”两篇文章。“农村防疫常识”和“家畜传染病防治常识”这两种小册子内容通俗，并配有插图，可以帮助识字不多的农民读懂它的大意。这两种小册子对农民有很大的用处。“城市防疫常识”是以改善城市环境卫生为重点的，工厂、学校、机关、商店、住户和公共场所，可参考本书内容，改善公共卫生的设备。“彻底打败美帝国主义的细菌战”，扼要地叙述了美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国境内进行细菌战的罪证，并介绍了一些防御细菌战的常识。
    怎样利用这些挂图、招贴画和通俗小册子呢？
        一、各地卫生机关，可根据各地情况，订购招贴画、挂图若干，在公共场所、街道转角处广为张贴；各地文教机关，图书馆，市区文化馆，阅览室，识字学校等也可张贴。
     二、工厂、学校、机关、群众团体和其他公共场所（如电影院、剧场、文化宫、合作社）都可以张贴招贴画或挂图。商店可以用它们布置橱窗宣传。各地的宣传员、黑板报等，可以从这些图画和小册子中取得宣传材料。必要时，可组织一部分卫生工作的积极分子，根据挂图和小册子的内容，进行适当的讲解和学习。
    中央卫生部门为了帮助这些挂图、招贴画、通俗小册子的普遍发行，特地指定出版社减低了这些出版物的定价；各地新华书店应与各地卫生机关取得合作，及时地有计划地做好发行工作，把这些通俗的卫生出版物普遍地发行到群众中间去，特别是要注意联系县、区的卫生机关和宣传组织，把它们发行到农村群众中去。这样，对于目前正在广泛地深入地开展的爱国卫生运动，无疑地会有很大的帮助。
