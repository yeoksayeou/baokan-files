    **Cherish the Time of Labor Models**

    Comrade Editor: Liang Jiarui, a cotton production model from Chengjiao Village, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, completed spring plowing three days later than originally planned. The reason was that during the busy farming season, students from primary and secondary schools and cadres from government offices in the city constantly visited him and asked him to give reports. Liang Jiarui is a mutual aid team leader and village head, and he is busy enough leading the production of the entire village and team. Asking him to give "reports" or visiting him during the busy farming season inevitably delays his production. I am not against visiting labor models, but I am against delaying the production time of labor models during the busy farming season.

    **Ni Shiwen, a Farmer from Jurong County, Southern Jiangsu, Breaks Through Ideological Concerns and Actively Participates in the Increased Production Campaign**

    Comrade Editor: I used to be a poor peasant, following my father in renting land from landlords since I was a child. Every year during the harvest, we often had no grain left at home after the harvest (because all of it had been paid as rent). After liberation, we implemented land reform here, and my family was allocated 15.3 mu of land. I worked hard in production, using my father's decades of farming experience. Last year, I carefully cultivated a 4.5 mu field. In the autumn, I harvested 1,175 jin of rice per mu. My family's entire field yielded an average of 795 jin of rice per mu, which made the whole family extremely happy. After this news spread, Comrade Li from the work team came and asked me about it. I hurriedly lied and told him that this field only yielded 600 jin per mu. Why didn't I tell the truth? Because my father and some people in the village had told me: "Be careful, if you say too much, you will have to bear more burden." At that time, my own class consciousness was low, and I didn't understand the policies, so I believed them. However, when collecting public grain, my high-yield land was not required to pay more grain. At this time, I wanted to tell the truth, but I was afraid of being scolded by others, so I still didn't say it. Later, I was selected as a model in the village, but I was unwilling to be a model. In April of this year, Zong Caigui in the village told the truth. Last year, he had 2.34 mu of land, yielding 1,206 jin of rice per mu. As a result, he not only did not increase his burden, but was also commended. The county people's government also invited him to attend a meeting. Everyone said that Zong Caigui was glorious. Only then did I break through my ideological concerns. At this time, Comrade Zhao from the district committee came to the village to explain the policies, and I mustered up the courage to tell him the truth. With the help of Comrade Zhao, six households voluntarily formed a mutual aid team, and everyone elected me as the team leader. Now our whole team is participating in the increased production campaign. This year, the entire team's field is planned to achieve an average harvest of 650 jin per mu; my high-yield land will yield 1,600 jin per mu. In the future, I am determined to do the following: 1. Respond to Chairman Mao's call and take the lead in doing a good job in production. 2. Lead the mutual aid team well so that the mutual aid team can gradually consolidate and improve. 3. Learn advanced production experience, improve farming techniques, and guarantee the realization of the high-yield plan. 4. Strengthen political and cultural learning to improve ideological awareness.

    **The Work Team of Shuikou Township, Hengshan County, Should Overcome Conservative Ideas and Lead Farmers to Try Using Refined Fertilizer**

    Comrade Editor: Shuikou Township in Hengshan County, Hunan, is a key township in the agricultural high-yield movement in Hengshan County. However, the work team leading production in the township is not actively leading farmers to try using commercial fertilizers (refined fertilizers, chemical fertilizers). They believe that promoting commercial fertilizers is "helping the cooperative to do business." They even echo the masses, saying, "Commercial fertilizers are expensive and not suitable for local use." They have not recognized the benefits of using commercial fertilizers in agricultural production. The township's high-yield plan originally proposed applying 110 dan of fertilizer per mu, but in reality, only 80 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer was used per mu, without using any refined fertilizer at all. Cao Xilong, a cooperative cadre, discovered this situation and discussed the issue of supplying fertilizer to farmers with Hao Xinfu and Hu Xinping, the main cadres leading the high-yield movement in the township, on the phone, but they did not care about this matter. Later, through the efforts of the township cadres, farmers were mobilized to use a small amount of commercial fertilizer during the rice transplanting stage. The cooperative supplied more than 6,200 jin of commercial fertilizer to the township, and more than 5,000 jin are still in stock.
    The comrades of the Shuikou Township work team are completely wrong to not pay attention to the use of commercial fertilizers. We hope that the comrades of the work team will actively cooperate with the cooperative to handle the above-mentioned stored fertilizer and lead farmers to try using refined fertilizer during the topdressing period.

    **Disabled Veteran Wu Shuangxi is Determined to Join a Mutual Aid Team and Do a Good Job in Production**

    Comrade Editor: I am a disabled veteran, 41 years old this year. I joined the Eighth Route Army in 1938 and experienced the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. In fifteen years, I have received several major and minor merits. In February of this year, the superiors took care of my age and health and allowed me to return home to engage in production. The superiors gave me 3,000 jin of millet and 2 million yuan in RMB. On the one hand, I was very reluctant to leave my warm army family, and on the other hand, I was happy to return to the production post to participate in the increased production campaign. After returning home, hey! The village cadres took such good care of my family: I don't have to worry about life, my old mother is strong, and my children are also in school. I don't have to worry about resettlement at all. I am determined to use the honorary grain and money given to me by the superiors to expand production. I put 3,000 jin of millet in the credit cooperative and 1 million yuan in RMB in the People's Bank. I plan to use another 1 million yuan in RMB to buy livestock and farm tools in order to join a mutual aid team. I want to use the energy I used in fighting wars for production and strive to become a high-yield model in the autumn.

    **Suggestions for Using the "Marking Pole" Method to Catch and Beat Locusts**

    Comrade Editor: Locusts mostly breed in large areas of wilderness along rivers, lakes, and coasts. When people go to these areas to catch and beat locusts, they often waste a lot of manpower because the area is vast and it is not easy to grasp the locust situation. Based on my past experience in participating in locust control, to overcome this difficulty, it is best to use the "marking pole" method. The so-called "marking pole" is a small pole five or six feet long, inserted into the soil, with pieces of cloth of different sizes and colors tied on it to mark various different situations. When catching and beating locusts in the above areas, we first investigate the locust situation in each section and insert a "marking pole."
    We use large white cloths to indicate areas with serious locust infestations, small white cloths to indicate lighter areas, and red cloths to indicate areas that have been caught and beaten. In this way, people can see at a glance after entering the catching and beating area.
    This method has proven to be effective, and it is hoped that locust-prone areas can adopt it.

    **Farmers in Fushun County, Southern Sichuan, Find Water Sources to Overcome Drought**

    Comrade Editor: In March of this year, there was a drought in Fushun County, Southern Sichuan, and the masses in the county launched a movement to find water sources. The method of finding water sources was to mobilize farmers to recall where they had found water sources in the past, and then actively search for them in an organized manner. An old farmer in Jinshan Township, Third District, recalled: "A hundred years ago, a man named Chen fought a lawsuit over water, got angry, and blocked a water source." They went to the place pointed out by the old farmer to check and found the water source. In Anqing Township, there was a water source blocked by a large stone. Old farmers passed down the saying: "Move the big stone away, and you won't have to worry about food and clothing," but no one had ever found this water source in the past. This time, the masses organized themselves and found it. In Xinxing Village, Eleventh District, a water source the size of a teacup was found in a pond, solving the problem of water shortage for the whole village. According to statistics, in the forty days from the end of March to May 10, a total of 1,732 water sources were found in the county, irrigating more than 40,000 mu of land and overcoming the drought. Since then, local farmers have known that as long as they are willing to think of ways, they can overcome natural disasters. Now a common saying circulating among them is: "Find water sources, irrigate dry fields, and enjoy prosperity for ten thousand years."

    **Prevent Waste During the Busy Farming Season**

    Comrade Editor: During the rice transplanting period, farmers in Yutian Township, Second District, She County, Southern Anhui, experienced excessive eating and drinking. Generally, when farmers mutually help with rice transplanting or hire people to transplant rice, they have five meals a day. In the morning, each person eats three eggs first, and then eats breakfast; lunch must have at least four or five dishes and must have large pieces of pork; at four o'clock in the afternoon, they eat a meal of pasta; dinner not only has many dishes, but also wine; they smoke very good cigarettes. The direct reason for this phenomenon is that the rice transplanting time is tight and the labor force is insufficient. Some members of mutual aid teams who lack labor are afraid that the stronger members will go out to help other people and that they will not have anyone to help them and will not be able to transplant rice in time; some farmers hire people to transplant rice because they are afraid that if the food is not good, others will not work hard; some farmers also think that it doesn't matter to eat something good during the busy farming season. In this way, the phenomenon of eating and drinking waste is formed. Poor farmers have difficulties when hiring workers to help with rice transplanting. On the day when Qin Shuangxi's family transplanted rice, they managed to borrow 10,000 yuan, which was all spent at once. He said, "It's really difficult to transplant rice without money!"
    It is right for farmers to eat good meals during the busy farming season, but there should be a limit, and there should be no waste.

    要爱惜劳动模范的时间
    编辑同志：河北省石家庄市城角村棉花丰产模范梁家瑞完成春耕的时间，比原计划推迟了三天。原因是在农忙的时候，市里的中小学学生和机关干部，不断地去访问他，请他做报告。梁家瑞是互助组长，又是村长，他要领导全村全组生产，这就够忙的了。在农忙时候，请他作“报告”，或者去访问他，就必然要耽误他的生产。我并不反对访问劳动模范，但是我反对在农忙时耽误劳动模范的生产时间。

    打破思想顾虑积极参加增产竞赛
    编辑同志：我过去是个贫农，从小就跟着父亲，租种地主的田。每年收割时，常常是收割完了，家里也就没有了粮食（因为都缴了租）。解放以后，我们这里实行土地改革，我家分到十五亩三分地。我努力生产，采用我父亲几十年的种田经验。去年我在一块四亩五分大的田里精耕细作，到了秋天，每亩收获一千一百七十五斤水稻。我家全部田地，平均每亩收获七百九十五斤水稻，全家都高兴极了。这消息传开以后，工作队的李同志走来问我。我慌忙骗他说我这块田每亩只收了六百斤。我为什么不说真话呢？因为我父亲和村里个别的人曾对我说：“要注意，多说了要多负担。”当时我自己阶级觉悟低，不了解政策，就信了他们的话。但在征收公粮时，我的丰产地并没有要多缴粮。这时，我想说实话，又怕别人骂我，还是没有说。后来村里选我做模范，我还不愿当模范。今年四月间，村里宗才贵说了实话。他去年有二亩三分四厘田，每亩收了一千二百零六斤水稻。结果，他不但没有增加负担，而且受到表扬。县人民政府还请他去开会。到处都说宗才贵光荣。我这才打破了思想顾虑。这时区委赵同志来村里讲解政策，我就鼓起勇气，把实话告诉了他。在赵同志的帮助下，我们六户人家自愿成立了一个互助组，大家选我当组长。现在我们全组参加了增产竞赛，今年全组的田，计划要作到每亩平均收获六百五十斤；我那块高额产地，每亩要收获一千六百斤。今后我决心搞好下面几件事：一、响应毛主席号召，带头搞好生产。二、领导好互助组，使互助组逐渐巩固提高。三、学习先进生产经验，改进耕作技术，保证实现丰产计划。四、加强政治、文化学习，提高思想觉悟。

    衡山县水口乡工作组
    应克服保守思想领导农民试用细肥
    编辑同志：湖南衡山县水口乡是衡山县农业丰产运动中的重点乡。但在该乡领导生产的工作组，却不积极领导农民试用商品肥料（细肥料、化学肥料）。他们认为提倡商品肥料是“帮助合作社做买卖”，他们甚至跟着群众说：“商品肥料价钱贵，本地不适用。”他们没有认识使用商品肥料在农业生产上的好处。这个乡的丰产计划，每亩原拟施肥一百一十担，但实际每亩只用了八十担杂肥，完全没有使用细肥料。合作社干部曹希龙发现了这种情况，就在电话上和领导该乡丰产运动的主要干部郝新富、胡心平商量供给农民肥料的问题，但他们都不管这件事。后来经过这个乡的干部努力，才在插秧阶段，发动农民使用了少数商品肥料。合作社供应该乡商品肥料六千二百多斤，现在还存有五千多斤。
    水口乡工作组的同志这样不重视使用商品肥料，是完全不对的。我们希望工作组同志们在施用追肥时期，积极配合合作社处理上项积存肥料，领导农民试用细肥。

    决心参加互助组搞好生产
    编辑同志：我是一个荣誉军人，今年四十一岁。我在一九三八年参加了八路军，经历了抗日战争、解放战争。在十五年中，立过几次大小功劳。今年二月里，上级照顾我的年龄和健康，让我回家生产。上级发给我三千斤小米，二百万元人民币。我一方面很不愿意离开我那个温暖的军队大家庭，一方面也高兴回到生产岗位，可以参加增产竞赛运动。回家以后，嘿！村里干部把我家照顾得这样好：生活不愁，老母强壮，孩子也上了学，什么也不用我操心安置。我决心用上级给我的荣誉粮和钱来扩大生产。我把三千斤小米放在信贷合作社，把一百万元人民币放在人民银行。另外一百万元人民币，我准备买牲口和农具，以便参加互助组。我要把打仗的那股劲用到生产上来，争取秋后当个丰产模范。

    建议采用“标志竿”办法捕打蝗虫
    编辑同志：蝗虫大多产生在沿河、沿湖、沿海的大片荒野地区。人们到这些地区去捕打蝗虫时，常因地区辽阔，不容易掌握蝗情，浪费大量人力。根据我过去参加捕蝗的经验，要克服这个困难，最好采用“标志竿”的办法。所谓“标志竿”是用五六尺长的小竿子，插入土中，上面绑上大小颜色不同的布片，标志各种不同的情况。在上述地区捕打蝗虫时，我们先侦察清楚每一地段蝗虫的情况，插上一根“标志竿”。
    我们用大白布表示蝗虫严重的地区，小白布表示较轻的地区，红布表示已捕打过的地区。这样，人们进入捕打地区以后，就能一目了然。
    这个办法证明有效，希望发生蝗虫的地区能够采用。

    农民寻找水源战胜旱灾
    编辑同志：今年三月间，川南富顺县天旱，全县群众展开了一个找水源运动。找水源的办法，是发动农民回忆过去在什么地方发现过水源，然后有组织地积极地去寻找。三区金山乡一个老农回忆说：“百年前姓陈的因争水打官司，气不过，把一个水源塞住了。”他们到老农指点的地方去察看，果然找到了水源。安庆乡有个被大石头塞住的水源。老农民相传说：“搬开大石头，吃穿都不愁”，但是过去从来没有找见这一个水源。这回群众组织起来，就找见了。十一区新兴村在一口塘里找见一个茶碗大的水源，解决了全村缺水的困难。据统计，从三月底到五月十日的四十天中，全县共找到水源一千七百三十二股，灌溉田地四万亩以上，战胜了干旱。从此当地农民知道，只要肯想办法，就能战胜自然灾害。现在普遍流传在他们口中的一句话是：“找水源，灌干田，享受万万年”。

    防止在农忙季节发生浪费
    编辑同志：皖南歙县第二区堨田乡农民在插秧期间，发生了大吃大喝的现象。一般农民在互助插秧或雇人插秧时，每天要吃五顿饭，早上每人先吃三个鸡蛋，然后再吃早饭；午饭起码要有四五个菜，并且必须有大块猪肉；下午四点多钟吃一顿面食；晚饭不但要有许多样菜，而且还要喝酒；吸的是很好的香烟。发生这种现象的直接原因是插秧时间紧迫，劳力不敷需用。有些缺乏劳动力的互助组组员，害怕劳力强的组员出去帮工，自己没人互助，不能及时插秧；有些农民雇人插秧，害怕吃得不好，别人干活不起劲；也有些农民认为农忙季节吃点好的不算什么。这样，就形成了吃喝浪费的现象。贫苦的农民在雇工帮助插秧时，就发生困难了。秦双喜家插秧的那一天，好容易东奔西走，借到一万元，一下就化光了。他说：“没钱要插秧真困难啦！”
    农民在农忙季节吃些好饭，是应该的，但应有个限度，不能浪费。汪崎峰
