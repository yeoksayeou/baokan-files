    ▲The workers of the Beijing State-owned Liulihe Cement Plant completed their semi-annual production increase and economization plan ten days ahead of schedule on the 20th of this month, creating an additional 37.6 billion yuan of wealth for the country. The workers are now striving with high production enthusiasm to create another 4.1 billion yuan of wealth for the country in the last ten days of June, to welcome the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the workers, the quality of cement has been significantly improved, and the cost has been greatly reduced. The average cost for the five months of this year has been reduced by 16.4 percent compared to last year.
    ▲In order to cooperate with the summer purchase, state-owned cotton yarn, general merchandise, and native produce companies and cooperatives in the northern Jiangsu area have allocated a large amount of means of production and means of livelihood to the wheat-producing areas to meet the needs of farmers after selling their new wheat. The means of production include 2 million pieces of large and small farm implements, over 100 million jin of cake fertilizer, and a large amount of wood, bamboo, tung oil, hemp silk, medicines, medical equipment, and chemical fertilizers. The total supply has exceeded the original plan for the first half of this year by more than 20 percent.
