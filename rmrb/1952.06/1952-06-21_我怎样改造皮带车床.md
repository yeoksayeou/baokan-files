    I, Shen Dezhang, a technician from the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6. Last year, our Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6 promoted high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods. Currently, 90 percent of our lathes regularly use high-speed cutting. The roughing speed of these lathes is around 80 meters per minute, and the finishing speed is around 200 meters per minute. Lathes that frequently use multi-tool, multi-edge cutting account for 30 percent of the factory's total number of lathes. Due to the implementation of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting, a contradiction has arisen between the performance of the lathes and the new operating methods. This contradiction is manifested as follows: when belt-driven lathes, which account for more than 80 percent of the total number of lathes, process cast iron workpieces with diameters of 200 mm or more using high-speed cutting, they cannot handle large cutting depths or feeds; when we promoted multi-tool, multi-edge cutting to the water pump workshop (which processes cast iron castings), we encountered the difficulty of insufficient power in the headstock. Some workers told us, "I can use multi-tool, multi-edge cutting for my work, but the lathe doesn't have the power." Some workers suggested speeding up the lathes to increase their power.
    The difficulties encountered in promoting multi-tool, multi-edge cutting and the workers' suggestions made me realize that solving the power and speed problems of belt-driven lathes is the key to further improving cutting speeds and widely applying multi-tool, multi-edge cutting.
    I began to think of ways to improve the performance of the machine tools. Initially, I wanted to groove the belt pulleys to increase the friction between the belt and the pulleys, thereby increasing the cutting force of the lathe. After careful analysis, I felt that this method was unscientific because the belt pulleys should be smooth. Grooving them would increase their friction and traction, which would put the belt in an overloaded state and cause it to break quickly. I thought about using V-belt pulley transmission. However, this only allows for two speeds: fast and slow. Having only two speeds is not suitable for handling a wide variety of tasks. I also considered using gearbox transmission. This method is excellent, but the cost of modifying a lathe is equal to half the price of a new lathe, which is too expensive.
    I finally found a way to modify the belt-driven lathe. One night, I saw a worker in the workshop machining the middle section of a water pump. Because the diameter of the workpiece was large, he couldn't use a large cutting depth or a fast speed, and the lathe often stalled. The worker was very anxious.
    "Wouldn't it be better to widen the belt a bit?" I asked the worker.
    "That would definitely be good!"
    Then, I noticed that not all eight gears on the lathe were being used; only a few gears were being used. So, I asked, "Suppose we change the four-step pulley to a three-step pulley, would that be okay?" The worker thought for a moment and said, "That would be great!"
    Thus, I began to design and calculate the modification. I selected a lathe for preliminary calculations, comparing the torque and power at each gear after the modification with those before the modification, and asked everyone to discuss it. Everyone agreed that this would increase the power of the machine tool and offered some supplementary suggestions.
    After obtaining the consent of the factory director and section chief, I handed the drawings to the repair department for modification. We modified the old-style belt-driven lathes according to the following four principles and methods. To explain it more clearly, we will use the Northeast-made eight-foot belt-driven lathe that was actually modified as an example.
    First, increase the machine tool's horsepower.
    Increasing the belt tension is the key to increasing the machine tool's horsepower. However, the original belt was narrow (two and a half feet wide) and had few layers, which limited the traction force, so the machine tool's horsepower could not be increased. To increase horsepower, a wider belt with more layers is needed to rotate. However, the belt width is limited by the width of each pulley step, so the width of each pulley step must be widened to widen the belt. The total width of the pulleys on the headstock is fixed, so the four-step pulley must be changed to a three-step pulley to widen each pulley step. It is possible for us to do this because, in actual production, only certain gears are commonly used. Taking the lathes in our factory as an example, among the four-step pulley, eight-gear lathes, only four gears are commonly used: 55 rpm, 140 rpm, 198 rpm, and 275 rpm. The rest are hardly ever used. Since there are unused gears, the four-step pulley can be changed to a three-step pulley, and the eight gears can be changed to six gears. When the four-step pulley is used as a three-step pulley, the width of each step can be increased by one-third, while the total width of the pulley remains unchanged. The method of modifying the four-step pulley into a three-step pulley is very simple: just install three cast iron rings of different sizes on the original pulley. After being changed to a three-step pulley, we used a three-and-a-half-foot wide, five-layer thick belt to rotate, which increased the effective tension by 1.73 times.
    Second, increase the headstock speed.
    Increasing the lineshaft speed can increase the headstock speed. However, after increasing the lineshaft speed, two issues need to be considered. One is that the number of spindle speed stages should not be too long. Because belt-driven lathes are speed-changed by pulleys and back gears, their changes are relatively rigid. For example, when the spindle speed stage has eight gears, even if the first gear's speed is 60 rpm, the eighth gear's speed would have to be as high as 1092 rpm; such a speed is difficult to control on a belt-driven lathe. The other issue is that the back gear ratio cannot be too large. Because if the speed ratio is too large, the speed change from the slow gear to the fast gear is too great. It is difficult to balance both the beginning and the end. The first issue has already been solved when changing the four-step pulley to a three-step pulley. The solution to the second issue is to replace a pair of back gears to make the back gear ratio 2.75 (according to our situation). In this way, all six gears increase at an equal ratio of 1.4, from 100 rpm to 540 rpm.
    Third, matching speed and torque.
    The inability to properly match speed and torque is a fundamental flaw of unmodified lathes. When the speed is 388 rpm, the torque is only 3.66 kg-m (torque unit), which cannot handle large cutting loads. When the torque is 43 kg-m, the speed is only 20 rpm, which is too low. After modifying the pulleys and back gears, this problem is solved: the speed increases evenly, the torque decreases evenly, and the two are properly matched.
    Fourth, bearing lubrication.
    Under high-speed rotation, bearing lubrication is an important issue. In theory, the oil inlet groove should be opened at the place where the oil film pressure is the lowest so that the oil film can be maintained to prevent oil layer vaporization. However, the oil grooves of belt-driven lathes are opened on the upper bearing, forming an "X" shape, where the oil film pressure is the highest. The modification method is to eliminate the upper bearing oil groove and open a 10 mm wide oil groove parallel to the spindle on the lower bearing and connect it to a large external oil cup with a copper pipe so that the lubricating oil is brought into the bearing from the place where the oil film pressure is the lowest, maintaining the oil film. This solves the problem of bearing heating under high-speed rotation.
    We have conducted performance tests and production tests on the modified lathe, and the results are very good. During the performance test, when machining gray cast iron with a diameter of 200 mm and a Shore hardness of 23, the headstock speed was 140 rpm, the cutting speed was 88 meters per minute, the cutting depth was 5 mm, and the feed rate was 0.5 mm. Before the modification, the cutting speed of the lathe was only 88 meters per minute, the cutting depth was only 2 mm, and the feed rate was only 0.25 mm. The cutting efficiency after the modification increased fivefold compared to before the modification. When cutting steel with a tensile strength of about 55 kg, the diameter of the workpiece was 75 mm, the lathe speed was 540 rpm, the cutting speed was 127 meters per minute, the cutting depth was 3 mm, and the feed rate was 0.33 mm. Before the modification, the highest speed of the lathe was only 388 rpm, and the tensile strength was only 3.66 kg; when cutting workpieces with a diameter of 75 mm, the highest cutting speed was only 127 meters per minute. In the production test, when machining dense baked castings with a diameter of 240 mm and a Shore hardness of 28, under the same other conditions, the efficiency of the modified lathe increased by 50 percent compared to before the modification.
    We are grateful for the help of Soviet expert Comrade Brusgulin. He offered many valuable suggestions. He believes that this modification method is correct. However, since the lathe's spindle was not precision ground during manufacturing (and precision grinding of the spindle is an important condition for preventing bearing heating when increasing speed), the best lubrication method is to use an oil pump for oil supply. Because the oil pump uses pressure to supply oil, it can supply oil from the upper bearing, and the oil groove of the lower bearing can be used as a return circuit. The oil pump device is very simple; just attach a cam to the spindle.
    The help of the Soviet expert has encouraged us. We will definitely accept his suggestions and modify the lathe even better.
    The modification principles and methods mentioned above can be universally applied, but in specific applications, the spindle speed, pulley stage, and back gear ratio must be determined based on production needs (i.e., the workpiece) and the original lathe's performance and characteristics. Remembering this is very important.
    In our country's machine manufacturing industry, belt-driven lathes account for a large proportion. We must modify these lathes to further increase cutting speeds and widely promote multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods, and improve our machine efficiency a step further. These modification principles and methods can also be applied to modify old-style milling machines, shapers, etc.

    我怎样改造皮带车床
    东北机械六厂技术员  沈德彰
    我们东北机械六厂在去年推广了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法。现在，有百分之九十的车床经常实行高速切削法。这些车床的粗车速度是每分钟八十公尺左右，精车速度是每分钟二百公尺左右。经常实行多刀多刃切削的车床，占全厂车床数的百分之三十。因为实行了高速切削和多刀多刃切削，车床性能和新的操作方法发生了矛盾。这个矛盾表现在：占车床总数的百分之八十以上的皮带车床，以高速切削法加工直径二百公厘以上的铸件工作物的时候，就不能吃大刀，送大刀；当我们把多刀多刃切削法推广到制造水泵车间（这个车间加工的都是生铁铸件）去的时候，遇到了床头动力不足的困难。有些工人告诉我们说：“我的活能用多刀多刃切削，但是床子没力气。”有些工人建议把车床的速度加快些，以便增加车床动力。
    在推广多刀多刃切削法的工作中遇到的困难和工人们的建议，使我认识了解决皮带车床的动力和转速问题，是更进一步提高切削速度法和广泛地应用多刀多刃切削法的关键。
    我开始想办法提高机床的性能。最初，我想在皮带塔轮上刻沟，以增加皮带和塔轮的摩擦力，提高车床切削的力量。经过仔细分析以后，我觉得这个办法是不科学的，因为皮带塔轮应该是光滑的，如果在上面开沟，就增加了它的摩擦和牵引力量，这就会使皮带处在超负荷的状态之下，很快就要坏了。我想用三角皮带轮传动。但是，这只有快的和慢的两种转动速度。而只有两种转速是不适合做多种多样的活的。我又想用变速箱传动。这种办法是很好的，但是改装一台车床的成本，等于半台车的价钱，太不合算。
    我终于找到了改造皮带车床的途径。有一天夜里，我在车间里看到一个工人正在车水泵的中段，由于加工物的直径很大，所以不能吃大刀，打快车，床子还常常被煞住。工人很着急。
    “把皮带改宽一点不好吗？”我问工人。
    “那的确好！”
    接着，我又看到车床上的八挡速度，并没有全用上；用到的只有其中的几挡速度。于是，我又问：“假使把四级塔轮改成三级，可以不可以呢？”工人思索了一下，说：“那很好！”
    这样，我就开始作改装的设计和计算。我选了一台车床，进行初步计算，把改装后每挡速度上的力矩和动力，与改装前作比，请大家讨论。大家认为这样做能增加机床的动力，并提出一些补充的意见。
    得到了厂长、科长的同意以后，我便把图样交给修理部进行改装。我们是按照下面四个原理和方法来改造旧式皮带车床的。为了说明得清楚些，我们以实际改装的东北制造的一种八呎皮带车床为例。
    第一、提高机床马力
    增加皮带的拉力是提高机床马力的关键。但是，原来的皮带窄（二呎半宽），层数少，牵引力量被限制住了，所以机床的马力不能提高。要提高马力，就需要用宽度大的、层数多的皮带来转动。但是，皮带宽度被每级塔轮的宽度限制住了，所以，必须加宽每级塔轮的宽度，才能加宽皮带。而塔轮在床头上的总宽度是固定了的，所以必须把四级的塔轮改成三级的，才能把每一级塔轮加宽。我们是有可能这样做的。因为在实际的生产中，常用的只有一定的几挡速度。拿我们厂的车床来说，在四级塔轮、八挡速度的床子中，常用的只是每分钟五十五转、一百四十转、一百九十八转和二百七十五转中间的四挡速度，其余的几乎都没有用过。既然有用不到的挡，就可以把四级塔轮改成三级塔轮，把八挡变为六挡。四级塔轮当作三级用，每一级的宽度就可以增加三分之一，而塔轮的总宽度仍然不变。把四级塔轮改装成三级塔轮的方法很简单，只要在原塔轮上装上大小不同的三个铸铁圈就可以了。改成三级塔轮以后，我们用三点五呎宽、五层厚的皮带来转动，就提高了有效拉力一点七三倍。
    第二、提高床头转速
    提高天轴转速就能提高床头转速。但是天轴转速提高以后，要注意两个问题。一个是车床主轴的转速级数不宜太长。因为皮带车床是由塔轮和慢轮变速的，它的变化比较呆板。譬如说，主轴的转速级数有八级的时候，即使第一挡的转速是每分钟六十转，第八挡的转速也要高到每分钟一千零九十二转；这样的转速，在皮带车床上是很难控制的。另
    一个问题是后齿轮的速比不能太大。因为速比太大了，从慢挡到快挡的转速变化太大。这是很难首尾兼顾的。第一个问题在把四级塔轮改三级的时候已经同时解决了。第二个问题的解决办法是换一对后齿轮，使后齿轮的速比变为二点七五（按我们的情形）。这样，六挡转速都按一点四的等比级数上升，从每分钟一百转到五百四十转。
    第三、转速和力矩的配合
    转速和力矩不能适当地相配合，是没有改装过的车床的基本缺点。当转速每分钟是三百八十八转的时候，力矩只有三点六六公斤—公尺（力矩单位），不能担负大的切削负荷。当力矩在四十三公斤—公尺的时候，转速只有二十转，这太低了。改塔轮和改后齿轮以后，这个问题就跟着解决了：转速均匀上升，力矩均匀下降，两者适当地配合起来了。
    第四、轴承的润滑
    在高速旋转的情况下，轴承的润滑是个重要的问题。照理讲，应该把进油槽开在油膜压力最低的地方，油膜才能保持，以防止油层汽化。但是皮带车床的油沟，却是开在上轴承，成“X”形，那里的油膜压力最高。改装的办法是把上轴承油槽取消，另在下轴承开一条十公厘宽和主轴相平行的油槽，并用铜管把它接到外部的一个大油杯内，使润滑油自油膜压力最低的地方带入轴承，保持油膜。这就解决了在高转速的情况下轴承发热的问题。
    我们曾经在改装以后的车床上进行了性能试验和生产试验，成绩都很好。作性能试验时，车直径二百公厘、萧尔硬度二十三度的灰铸件时，床头转速是每分钟一百四十转，切削速度是每分钟八十八公尺，切削深度是五公厘，送刀量是零点五公厘。改装前的车床，每分钟的切削速度八十八公尺的时候，切削深度只有二公厘，送刀量只有零点二五公厘，改装后的切削效率比改装前提高了五倍。在切削抗张力五十五公斤左右的钢料时，加工物的直径是七十五公厘，车床转速是五百四十转，切削速度每分钟是一百二十七公尺，切削深度三公厘，送刀量零点三三公厘。而改装前的车床，最高转速只有三百八十八转，抗张力只三点六六公斤；切削直径七十五公厘的加工物的时候，最高的切削速度只有一百二十七公尺。在生产试验中，车直径二百四十公厘、萧尔硬度二十八度的密烘铸件时，在其他条件不变的情况下，改装后的车床比改装前提高效率百分之五十。
    我们感谢苏联专家布鲁斯古林同志的帮助。他提出了很多宝贵的意见。他认为这样的改装法是正确的。但是，由于车床的主轴在制造时没经过精磨（而主轴的精磨是提高转速时轴承不至发热的一个重要条件），润滑方法最好是用油泵给油。因为油泵是利用压力给油的，可以从上轴承进油，下轴承的油槽可以作为回路用。油泵的装置是很简单的，只要在主轴上带一个凸轮就成了。
    苏联专家的帮助鼓舞了我们。我们一定接受他的意见，把车床改装得更好些。
    上面提出的改装原理和方法是可以普遍地应用的，但在具体应用的时候，必须根据生产的需要（即加工物），根据原来车床的性能和特点，来决定主轴转速、塔轮级数和后齿轮的速比。记住这一点是十分重要的。
    在我国机器制造业里，皮带车床的比重是很大的。我们必须改装这些车床，以便更进一步地提高切削速度和广泛地推广多刀多刃切削法，把我们的机器效率提高一步。这种改造的原理和方法，也可以应用它改装旧式铣床、牛头刨床等。
