    参加奥中友好周巡回演出后
    我国青年文工团离开奥地利
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】我国青年文艺工作团在维也纳及奥地利各省巡回演出了三星期之后，已于十八日离开奥地利。在维也纳车站送行的有许多维也纳市民和自由奥地利青年联盟的代表等。托席克先生并代表奥地利奥中友好周委员会，把贝多芬全部四重奏的乐谱送给我国文艺工作团。
    我国青年文艺工作团在奥地利总共演出了二十九场，观众几乎有十万人。最后一次在维也纳市政厅前演出，吸引了好几千名观众。维也纳市政委员劳歇尔在发言中指出，尽管奥地利当局的阻难和政府各党的领袖们抱着敌意态度，中国艺术家已经取得了奥地利全体人民的衷心欢迎，因为每一个人都知道，他们的艺术表现是各国人民友好与和平的音讯。
    我国青年文艺工作团在致奥地利人民的告别书中，感谢奥地利人民的热诚招待，并感谢奥地利人民对我国人民的友谊及我国文化的热爱和尊崇。
