    Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Tokyo Delayed News: Watanabe Michio, representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions Japanese Liaison Office, issued a statement on May 10th, entitled "Exposing to the World Federation of Trade Unions and all workers worldwide the facts of the suppression in the People's Square in Japan," further revealing the truth of the "May 1st" massacre manufactured by the US and Japanese reactionaries and calling on the people of the world to continue to support the struggle of the Japanese people.
    The statement first detailed the brutal suppression by Japanese police and US military police on May 1st, in which they massacred and arrested large numbers of unarmed demonstrators in People's Square, and described the true situation of the demonstrators' heroic struggle against the reactionaries in self-defense. The statement said: In the bloody struggle, union member Masao Takahashi was barbarically shot dead. A total of nine people were shot dead by US military police or crushed by jeeps. It is estimated that another 51 people were seriously injured and 585 were slightly injured, and the actual number of injured is far greater than this. The police authorities also carried out large-scale arrests after the event, and by May 9th, the total number of those arrested had reached 475.
    The statement said: The World Federation of Trade Unions Japanese Liaison Office and the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions issued a statement on the same day, protesting to the Yoshida government, supporting the heroic struggle of workers and students, and taking appropriate measures for those arrested, injured, and sacrificed. The statement also severely condemned the slanderous statements and traitorous behavior of the "May 1st" Executive Committee controlled by right-wing elements of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan against the Japanese Communist Party.
    The statement further pointed out: The US and Japanese reactionaries are urgently preparing to implement the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" and revise labor laws and regulations in order to establish a police state. However, the Japanese people will never be silent in the face of the enemy's offensive. Japanese workers are already preparing to hold a third general strike, which is estimated to be larger in scale and stronger in strength than the previous two, and will have a more stubborn expression towards the enemy's use of violence.
    The statement concluded by saying: The vanguard of the Japanese people's fighting force for national liberation, democracy, and peace—the Japanese working class—cherishes the sympathy and support of the World Federation of Trade Unions and all peace-loving forces around the world and asks them to continue to provide support and encouragement.
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party parliamentary group issued a statement on May 31st, protesting the bloody suppression of the Japanese people by the police on May 30th. The statement pointed out that the bloody suppression incident of "May 30th" was planned and manufactured by the traitorous Yoshida government, and demanded the dissolution of these police stations that have completely turned into terrorist organizations.
    According to the National Local Police Headquarters, the number of people arrested on May 30th has increased to 130.

    世界工联日本联络事务局揭露
    美日反动派制造“五一”惨案真相
    日共国会议员团抗议吉田政府迫害爱国者
    【新华社五日讯】东京迟到消息：世界工联日本联络事务局代表渡边三知夫曾于五月十日发表“向世界工联和全世界所有工人揭露日本的人民广场镇压行为的事实”的声明，进一步揭露美、日反动派制造“五一”惨案的真相，并呼吁世界人民继续支援日本人民的斗争。
    声明首先详细叙述了日本警察和美国宪兵于五月一日在人民广场大批屠杀和逮捕手无寸铁的示威群众的镇压暴行，并叙述了示威群众为了自卫与反动派展开英勇斗争的真实情况。声明说：在流血的斗争中，工会会员高桥正夫被野蛮地枪杀了。被美国宪兵枪杀或被吉普车辗死的共有九人。据估计，另外重伤者五十一人，轻伤者五百八十五人，而实际受伤人数远超过此数。警察当局并在事后大肆逮捕，到五月九日，被捕者总数已达四百七十五人。
    声明说：世界工联日本联络事务局和全日本产业别工会会议当日发表声明，向吉田政府提出抗议，支持工人与学生所进行的英勇斗争，并对被捕者、受伤者和牺牲者采取了适当的措施。声明同时严厉地斥责了日本工会总评议会右翼分子控制下的“五一”执行委员会所发表的诬蔑日本共产党的声明和叛卖行为。
    声明进一步指出：美日反动派正急于准备实施“防止破坏活动法案”和修改劳工法规，以便建立一个警察国家。但是日本人民对于敌人的进攻，是永远不会沉默的。日本工人已经在准备举行第三次总罢工，这次总罢工估计将比前两次规模更大，力量更强，对于敌人施用暴力将会有更加顽强的表示。
    声明最后说：日本人民争取民族解放、民主与和平的战斗力量的先锋队——日本工人阶级，很珍重世界工联和全世界爱好和平力量的同情与支持，并要求他们继续给予支持与鼓励。
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团在五月三十一日发表声明，抗议警察在五月三十日对日本人民的血腥镇压。声明指出“五·三○”的血腥镇压事件是吉田卖国政府有计划制造的，并要求解散这些完全变成恐怖组织的警察局。
    据国家地方警察本部宣布，在五月三十日被捕的人数已增加到一百三十人。
