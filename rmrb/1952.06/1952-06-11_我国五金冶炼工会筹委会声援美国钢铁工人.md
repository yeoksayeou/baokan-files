Xinhua News Agency, June 10th: The China National Metal and Smelting Workers Union Preparatory Committee recently sent a telegram to the United States steelworkers, voicing support for their strike struggle to win wage increases and improved working conditions. The telegram reads as follows:

To our American steelworker brothers:

We, representing the Chinese metal workers, deeply sympathize with and resolutely support your reasonable action to win wage increases and improve working conditions. Your nationwide general strike is not only a heroic action against Wall Street's frantic attack on the living standards of the American working class, but also a serious blow to the US ruling class's war preparations and the war of aggression against Korea, and helps the world peace movement. We wish you strengthened unity and great victory.
