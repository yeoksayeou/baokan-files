Letter to the Editor Abstracts

The Mixed Warehouse of a Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district Still Has Not Addressed the Issue of Rail Handling After Newspaper Criticism

    More than a month has passed since the article "Small Rails Near the Mixed Warehouse of a Certain Unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district Should Be Dismantled and Properly Preserved" was published on the "Reader's Letters" page on April 16th. However, these thousands of meters of small rails are still being ignored.
    In February or March of last year, the Shijiazhuang Daily published a reader's letter that made the same suggestion. The person in charge of the Mixed Warehouse of a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district replied that the rails would be properly handled; but in reality, nothing was done. This year, the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page raised the issue again, and people said that this time the problem would probably be solved. But for more than a month, there has been no movement.
    I believe that the bureaucratic attitude of a certain unit of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district in not valuing the people's property and ignoring the opinions of the masses has reached an intolerable level. I suggest that the person in charge of the Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district promptly supervise the handling of these small rails by their subordinates and publicly review the mistakes made on this issue.

Suggestions for the Ministry of Forestry to Produce Slides on Afforestation and Forest Protection for In-depth Promotion in Forest Areas

    Anhui University purchased a batch of slides on afforestation, forest utilization, and hillside closure for afforestation from the Chinese Forestry Editorial Board of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government. Through the slides, the students saw the vast and magnificent mountain forests of the motherland and the operational processes of afforestation, forest protection, and mountain forest utilization. They gained a lot of practical knowledge and increased their interest in learning forest science.
    Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Forestry compile the above-mentioned materials, as well as the causes and circumstances of mountain forest fires, experiences in hillside closure for afforestation and forest protection, and model deeds, into a set of slides to be shown in forest areas. This will enable the masses in forest areas to understand the functions of forests and learn a lot of common knowledge about afforestation and forest protection.  Kang Ruming

People's Banks in Various Regions Should Not Hold Up Funds for Subsidizing Poor Revolutionary Military Dependents

    From January 19th to 21st of this year, we entrusted the Henan Provincial People's Bank Business Department to remit a batch of funds to poor revolutionary military dependents to help them solve difficulties in their lives and production. However, almost half a year has passed, and many revolutionary military dependents have written to say that they have not yet received the remittances. This not only reduces the effectiveness of these funds but also affects the lives and production of poor revolutionary military dependents. We suggest that relevant units of the People's Banks in various regions quickly correct this situation of holding up funds for subsidizing poor revolutionary military dependents.

Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau Should Immediately Repair the Yuhe River Bridge Project

    When the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau dredged the Yuhe River last year, it rebuilt several bridges over the river. However, due to problems in design and construction, several incidents have occurred in less than half a year. I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau quickly inspect these projects, immediately find ways to remedy them, and pay attention to improving the quality of the projects in future construction.

The Food Problem of Employees in the Ninyuan Dormitory of the Tianjin Railway Administration Urgently Needs to Be Resolved

    The Ninyuan Dormitory of the Tianjin Railway Administration houses more than 300 single employees, and their food problem urgently needs to be resolved. The dormitory's canteen is very small and often overcrowded. People have to queue up to get food, and even after getting it, they often can't find a seat. When the weather gets hot, the air in the canteen is bad and uncomfortable. On Sundays and holidays, the canteen does not sell food, and employees have to go out to eat, which is not only expensive but also inconvenient. The employees living in the Ninyuan Dormitory have a lot of opinions about this and hope that the relevant leading departments of the Tianjin Railway Administration will resolve this problem.

    来信摘要
    石家庄军分区某部混合仓库仍未接受报纸批评处理铁轨问题
    四月十六日“读者来信专页”刊登了“石家庄军分区某部混合仓库附近小铁轨应拆下妥为保存”一稿，至今已一个多月了。但是，这数千公尺长的小铁轨，现在仍然无人过问。
    去年二、三月间，石家庄日报登载了一篇读者来信，早已提出了同样的建议。石家庄军分区某部混合仓库负责人答复说，要适当处理这批铁轨；但实际上并没有处理。今年人民日报读者来信专页又提出了这个问题，人们都说，这次大概可以解决问题了。但一个多月以来，还是没有动静。
    我认为石家庄军分区某部对人民财产不予重视，对群众意见置若罔闻的官僚主义态度，已经达到令人不能容忍的程度。我建议石家庄军分区某部负责人迅速督促所属处理这些小铁轨，并公开检讨在这个问题上所犯的错误。  温一真
    建议林业部制造造林、护林幻灯片深入林区进行宣传
    安徽大学曾从中央人民政府林业部中国林业编辑委员会买了一批关于造林、森林利用和封山育林的幻灯片。同学们从幻灯片中，看到了祖国广大雄伟的山林情况和造林、护林、山林利用的作业过程，得到很多实际知识，增加了学习森林科学的兴趣。
    因此，我建议林业部把上述的材料，和山林火灾发生的原因、情况，封山育林和护林的经验、模范事迹等，编成一套幻灯片，到林区放映。这样会使林区群众认识森林的功用，学到很多造林、护林常识。  康汝明
    各地人民银行不应积压补助贫苦革命军人家属的用款
    我们在今年一月十九日至二十一日，曾委托河南省人民银行营业部，汇了一批款给贫苦革命军人家属，以便帮助他们解决生活和生产中的困难。但至今将近半年，有很多革命军人家属来信说，还没有收到这批汇款。这样，不仅减低了这批款的效用，而且影响了贫苦革命军人家属的生活和生产。我们建议各人民银行有关单位，迅速纠正这种积压补助贫苦革命军人家属用款的情况。

    北京市卫生工程局应立即补修御河桥梁工程
    北京市卫生工程局去年挖御河时，曾经重建该河上的几处桥梁。但由于设计施工都有毛病，至今不到半年，已经发生过好几次事件。我建议北京市卫生工程局迅速检查这些工程，立即设法补救；并在今后施工时注意提高工程质量。

    天津铁路管理局宁园宿舍职工伙食问题急待解决
    天津铁路管理局宁园宿舍住着三百多个独身职工，他们的伙食问题急待解决。这个宿舍的食堂很小，常常拥挤不堪，领菜领饭都得排队，即使领到了饭菜，还常常找不到座位。天气一热，食堂中空气恶劣，令人难受。星期日及节日食堂不卖饭，职工们只得上街去吃，不但价钱高，而且不方便。住在宁园宿舍的职工对此很有意见，希望天津铁路管理局有关领导部门解决这个问题。
