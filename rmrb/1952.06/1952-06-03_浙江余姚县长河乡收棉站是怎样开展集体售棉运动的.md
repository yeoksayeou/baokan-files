The Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station of the Yuyao County Cooperative in Zhejiang Province vigorously promoted cotton purchasing throughout the county last year by deeply organizing the masses and implementing collective cotton sales.

From September to December of last year, the Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station had to complete the task of purchasing 658,300 jin of cotton, and also called on cotton farmers to implement "actual cotton storage" to save national funds. In order to complete the above tasks, all staff of the station, under the leadership of the district purchasing committee, studied the experience of past cotton purchasing work and analyzed the current cotton purchasing situation: First, the masses responded to the call to sell cotton for patriotic reasons, and their enthusiasm for selling cotton was high; crowding and chaos may occur at the cotton purchasing station during cotton purchasing. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent accidents such as wrong accounts and wrong scales; second, farmers are in the busy season of autumn harvest and autumn plowing, and the time for farmers to sell cotton should be saved as much as possible to avoid hindering production; third, revolutionary martyrs' families and other households lacking labor face more difficulties when selling cotton, and efforts should be made to mobilize the masses to help each other; fourth, the cotton selling units should be concentrated as much as possible to save working time and improve the efficiency of the cotton purchasing station. Based on the above situation, the station decided to carry out a mass collective cotton selling movement in a planned and step-by-step manner.

However, some village cadres did not actively promote the collective cotton selling movement. They believed that selling cotton was a matter for the farmers themselves, and "there is no need to organize and lead, and the task can be completed." Therefore, they only made some simple and general propaganda to the farmers on cotton selling work. This simple and general propaganda not only failed to truly organize the masses, but also increased the farmers' concerns about trouble and lack of freedom. This further fueled the cotton farmers' idea of holding back for a better price. The collective cotton selling movement was launched with poor ideological and organizational preparation and a lack of experience, resulting in temporary chaos in cotton purchasing. For example, when Dianqiao Township sold cotton collectively to the Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station for the first time, fifteen groups concentrated on selling more than 6,000 jin of cotton, starting at 5:00 in the morning and ending at 2:00 in the afternoon. Although the work of the cotton purchasing station was tense, the efficiency was low, and there were many mistakes, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses complained: "Collective cotton selling is worse than no collective selling!"

After discovering these situations, the Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station conducted research with the district purchasing committee and decided to focus on Dianqiao Township and take the following series of steps to reverse the above deviations.

First, starting with educating cadres, convene village cadre meetings, summarize the shortcomings of the previous stage of work, clearly understand the current ideological concerns of cotton farmers, and explain the political significance of collective cotton sales to village cadres. Then, convene rural backbone activists' meetings, cotton farmer representative meetings, and cooperative member representative meetings to enlighten cadres and activists through comparative education, making them recall the tragic life before liberation when "one jin of cotton could be exchanged for twelve liang of rice; if you didn't sell, you would starve; if you sold, you would cry," enlighten their class consciousness, and increase their enthusiasm for selling cotton.

After the representatives returned to the village, they convened group leader meetings to deliberate and reorganize the cotton selling organization. Then, mass meetings were held in villages to carry out extensive and in-depth patriotic cotton selling propaganda, publicize the ten major policies of agricultural production and the cotton-grain price ratio, and put forward the slogan "Sell patriotic cotton quickly and defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible." After in-depth education, the political awareness of the masses was generally improved. In the discussion, the cotton selling groups realized that the previous cotton selling of "getting up early and going to bed late" and wasting work was mainly because the organization work was not done well, rather than the collective cotton selling method being bad. The masses' thinking changed, and a new upsurge of the collective cotton selling movement was created.

In order to improve its work, the cotton purchasing station, based on the opinions of the masses, organized the masses in each village to establish six specialized groups, and democratically elected activists to serve as the heads of each group. The six groups are:

1.  Evaluation Group: The day before the masses sell cotton, the evaluation group in the village conducts a preliminary evaluation of the cotton, so that the masses fully understand the principle of "superior grade, superior price, and inferior grade, inferior price." After democratic evaluation, the evaluation group puts forward opinions on the grade of each household's cotton, then sends the cotton to the cotton purchasing station, and tells the initial evaluation opinions to the grading personnel, and finally determines the grade.
2.  Inspection Group: Before selling, check whether the cotton is clean, whether yellow cotton and white cotton are separated, whether the grades are mixed, whether there is any water or impurities, and prevent counter-revolutionaries from sabotaging.
3.  Statistics Group: The day before the sale, count the amount of cotton sold in the village and report it to the cotton purchasing station, and then come with the cotton selling group the next day to help cotton farmers record codes and calculate accounts.
4.  Weighing Supervision Group: Calibrate the weighing in the village the day before the cotton selling, and then come to the station the next day to calibrate the scale and supervise the weighing, so that the phenomenon of inaccurate scales is eliminated, and fairness and rationality are achieved.
5.  Communication and Liaison Group: Notify the cotton purchasing station of the quantity of cotton sold in each village in advance, arrange the time, sell cotton by village and group, and keep in touch with the township and other villages at any time to avoid busyness and crowding, and to ensure order and order.
6.  Mutual Assistance Group: Help the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary workers who lack labor, as well as widowed, orphaned, and childless households to sell cotton.

The above six organizations were created by the masses themselves and have proven to be necessary in practice. The masses are generally satisfied with this approach.

The Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station in Yuyao County organized cotton farmers to sell cotton collectively, which solved many difficulties for cotton farmers in selling cotton and saved cotton farmers' time and labor. Collective cotton selling strengthened the planning of work and improved the sense of responsibility of cotton purchasing personnel for their work. In the past, four people were needed to pack bags at the station (two people pulling the bag, one person treading the cotton, and one person banging the cotton). After research, the method of pulling the bag with nails was changed, and one person could do the work of four people. The staff of the cotton purchasing station all signed patriotic covenants to ensure "to be kind and friendly to the cotton sellers, explain the significance of collective cotton sales, and persuade cotton sellers not to smoke"; the cotton inspectors guaranteed "to inspect accurately and carefully write the price list"; the scale operator guaranteed "to shout loudly (so that the billing can hear clearly), see accurately, and weigh quickly," thus greatly reducing accidents and errors in the work and improving the work efficiency of cotton purchasing.

Due to the implementation of mass evaluation in the work of collective cotton selling, the phenomenon of adulteration and dampness has been reduced. Because cotton farmers organized themselves to sell cotton to the state, the loopholes for speculators were eliminated.

Because the Changhe Township Cotton Purchasing Station adopted the working method of collective cotton selling, by the end of December last year, it had collected a total of 662,700 jin of ginned cotton in four months, exceeding the purchase target. During the cotton purchasing process, the station also handled cotton storage business. By the end of December, it had absorbed more than 190,000 jin of stored cotton (accounting for 28.8% of the total purchase). The experience of collective cotton selling in Changhe Township quickly spread throughout the county, playing a great role in promoting cotton selling work in the county. As of the end of December 1951, Yuyao County had purchased a total of 126,195 dan of ginned cotton, over fulfilling and completing the cotton purchasing task ahead of schedule.

    浙江余姚县长河乡收棉站是怎样开展集体售棉运动的
    余姚县合作总社
    浙江省余姚县合作社长河乡棉花收购站去年收购棉花时，深入组织群众，实行集体售棉，有力地推动了全县的收棉工作。
    长河乡收棉站去年九月至十二月的四个月内，要完成收购棉花六十五万八千三百斤的任务，还要号召棉农实行“棉花存实”，以节省国家资金。为了完成上述任务，该站全体工作人员在区收购委员会的领导下，研究了过去收棉工作的经验，分析了今年收棉工作的情况：一、群众响应爱国售棉的号召，卖棉情绪高涨；收购棉花时，收棉站可能发生拥挤和混乱现象。因此要防止发生错账、错秤等事故；二、农民正在秋收、秋耕的农忙时期，应当尽量节省农民卖棉时间，以免妨碍生产；三、烈军属以及其他缺乏劳动力的农户，卖棉花时困难更多，应设法发动群众互相帮助；四、要尽量使卖棉的单位集中，以节省工作时间，提高收棉站工作效率。根据以上情况，该站决定有计划有步骤地开展群众性的集体售棉运动。
    但是，部分村干部没有积极推动集体售棉运动。他们认为卖棉花是农民自己的事情，“用不着组织和领导，也能完成任务”，因而在售棉工作上对农民只作了一些简单的空泛的宣传。这种简单的空泛的宣传，不但不能真正把群众组织起来，反而使农民增加了怕麻烦、怕不自由的顾虑。这就更加助长了棉农的等价惜售思想。在思想准备和组织准备都很差，而又缺乏经验的情况下，开展了集体售棉运动，结果造成了一时收购棉花的混乱现象。如垫桥乡第一次向长河乡收棉站集体售棉时，十五个组集中出售六千多斤棉花，从早晨五点开始，到下午两点钟才售完。收棉站的工作虽然紧张，但效率既低，差错又多，引起群众普遍不满。群众纷纷反映：“集体售棉比不集体还要坏！”
    长河乡收棉站发现了这些情况之后，便和区收购委员会进行研究，决定以垫桥乡为重点，采取以下一系列的步骤，扭转上述偏向。
    首先，从教育干部着手，召开村干部会议，总结前一阶段工作的缺点，明确认识当前棉农的思想顾虑，向村干部讲明集体售棉的政治意义。然后召开农村骨干积极分子会议、棉农代表会议及合作社社员代表会议等，以对比教育的方式，启发干部和积极分子，使他们回忆解放前“一斤棉花换十二两米，不卖饿肚皮，卖掉出眼泪”的惨痛生活，启发他们的阶级觉悟，提高他们售棉的积极性。
    各代表回村以后就召开小组长会议，酝酿整理售棉组织。然后再以村为单位召开群众大会，展开广泛深入的爱国售棉宣传，宣传农业生产十大政策和棉粮比价，提出“快卖爱国棉，早日打垮美国侵略军”的口号。进行深入的教育以后，群众的政治觉悟普遍提高了。各售棉小组在讨论中认识到前一段卖棉花“起早落夜”、误工受累，主要是因为组织工作没有做好，而不是集体售棉的方法不好。群众思想有了转变，重新造成了集体售棉运动的热潮。
    收棉站为了改进工作，根据群众意见，在每个村里都组织群众建立了六个专门的小组，民主推选了积极分子担任各组负责人。这六个小组是：
    一、评议组：群众出售棉花的前一天，在村里先由评议组对棉花进行初评，使群众充分认识“优级优价，低级低价”的道理。评议组经过民主评议，对各户棉花的等级提出意见，然后把棉花送往收棉站，并把初评意见告诉验级人员，最后确定等级。二、检查组：在出售前检查棉花是否干净，黄花白花是否分开，品级是否混乱，有没有掺水掺杂情况，并防范反革命分子进行破坏。三、统计组：在售棉前一天统计村内出售棉花的数量，并报告收棉站，次日再和售棉小组同来，帮助棉农记码算账。四、监秤组：售棉前一天在村内校准秤量，并在次日来站校秤、监秤，因而杜绝了秤码不准的现象，作到了公平合理。五、通信联络组：把本村每期售棉数量，事先通知收棉站，排定时间，按村分组出售，并随时和乡及其他村联系，以免忙乱拥挤，做到秩序井然、有条不紊。六、互助组：帮助缺乏劳动力的革命烈士、革命军人和革命工作人员家属以及鳏、寡、孤、独户售棉。
    以上六种组织，是群众自己创造出来的，在实践中证明是需要的。群众对这种做法普遍感到满意。
    余姚县长河乡收棉站组织棉农集体售棉，解决了不少棉农售棉时的困难，节省了棉农的时间和劳动力。集体售棉加强了工作的计划性，提高了收棉人员对工作的责任心。站上过去装包需要四个人（二人拉袋，一人踏花，一人棒花），经过研究，改用钉钩拉袋的方法，一个人就能做四个人的工作。收棉站工作人员都订立了爱国公约，保证“要向售棉者和和气气，讲清集体售棉的意义，劝请售棉的人不吸烟”；验花员保证“验得准，仔细写好批价单”；司秤员保证“喊得响（使开票的能够听清楚），看得准，秤得快”，因而大大减少了工作中的事故、差错，提高了收棉的工作效率。
    由于在集体售棉的工作中实行了群众性的评议，掺杂、使潮的现象减少了。由于棉农自己组织起来向国家售棉，杜绝了奸商投机的空隙。
    长河乡收棉站因为采取了集体售棉的工作方法，到去年十二月底为止，四个月中共收进皮棉六十六万二千七百斤，超额完成收购任务。该站在收棉过程中，还办理了棉花存实业务，到十二月底，共吸收了十九万多斤存实棉（占整个收购数百分之二十八点八）。长河乡的集体售棉经验很快就在全县传播开来，对全县售棉工作起了很大的推动作用。截至一九五一年十二月底，余姚县计共收购了皮棉十二万六千一百九十五担，超额并提前完成了棉花收购任务。
