To the Editor: Our people's army is a force with a high level of cultural literacy. Cadres and soldiers alike regard culture as an indispensable sustenance. Even in the most intense battles, we squeeze in time to read books. During the Liberation War, the book "Days and Nights" encouraged us to seize victory, and the book "How the Steel Was Tempered" encouraged many convalescents to pick up their guns again and enthusiastically rush back to their work posts. And now, many good literary works, such as Neruda's poems, are encouraging us in the battles in Korea.

On the front lines in Korea, comrades have covered their shelters with photos from the People's Daily titled "Our Great Motherland." Many soldiers' diaries contain clippings of communications such as "Who Are the Most Lovable People" and "Soldiers and the Motherland," and transcriptions of those militant verses. We regard these excellent literary works as weapons of battle, and the heroic figures in the works as role models.

However, in our troops, we still cannot universally see excellent literary works. Last year, when we crossed the 38th parallel, we did not bring books and newspapers because they were inconvenient to carry. During the breaks in the fighting, no one could get their hands on a book to read. Later, a large number of books and magazines were sent from the motherland, but they were all thick volumes and large rolls, which we still could not carry during marches and battles. At the same time, these books were quite expensive, with a copy of "Ordinary Soldier" costing more than 20,000 yuan. We hope that the publication departments will print these excellent literary works in pocket editions and sell them cheaply to the soldiers in the troops, so that the soldiers have ample opportunity to obtain cultural sustenance.

### 建议出版部门把文学作品印成袖珍版廉价售给战士

    建议出版部门把文学作品印成袖珍版廉价售给战士
    编辑同志：我们人民的军队是一支有高度文化素养的部队，干部和战士都把文化看为一种不可缺少的食粮。就是在最激烈的战斗里，我们都在挤时间阅读书籍。在解放战争中，“日日夜夜”这本书鼓舞着我们夺取胜利，“钢铁是怎样炼成的”这本书鼓舞了许多休养员重新拿起枪支，热情奔向工作岗位。而现在，许多好的文艺作品，如聂鲁达的诗，都在鼓励我们在朝鲜的战斗。
    在朝鲜的前沿阵地上，同志们把人民日报上“我们伟大的祖国”的照片贴满了掩蔽部，不少战士的日记本内剪有“谁是最可爱的人”、“战士与祖国”等通讯，抄有那些富有战斗性的诗句。我们把这些优秀的文艺作品作为战斗的武器，把作品中英雄的人物作为榜样。
    然而，在我们部队中，我们还不能普遍看到优秀的文学作品。去年我们打过三八线时，因为书籍、报纸携带不便，就没有带去。在战斗间隙，谁也捞不到一本书看。后来大批的书报杂志从祖国送来了，但都是一厚本、一大卷的，我们在行军作战中，还是无法携带。同时这些书价钱颇贵，一本“普通一兵”要两万多元。我们希望出版部门把这些优秀的文学作品印成袖珍版本，廉价卖给部队的战士们，使战士们有充分获得文化食粮的机会。
