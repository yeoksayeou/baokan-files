    Zhang Zikai Writes:
    Stand Firm and Repel the Onslaught of Unscrupulous Merchants

    To the Editor: I have been engaged in economic work for several years, and I am currently working at the Beijing Trust Company. Over the years, although I have handled a large amount of funds and had very frequent contact with private merchants, I have never been fooled by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, I want to use my own experience to refute Comrade Dong Anping's erroneous idea that "it is inevitable to be dragged down by unscrupulous merchants when engaged in economic work."

    In the spring of 1950, I led several comrades from the trust company to take over the shares of counter-revolutionary elements in the Tongqing Company. After we arrived at the company, the manager, Deng Bonan, began to play tricks. He was very attentive to us, inviting us to meals and to see plays. He attempted to buy us off in order to conceal enemy assets. At that time, I saw it very clearly, stood firm, and was not misled by him. I solemnly told him that everything must be done in accordance with policies and laws, and there could be no ambiguity; I criticized his attempt to conceal enemy property on the spot. We lived in Tongqing Company for more than a year and consistently conducted investigations with a responsible attitude, and finally successfully completed the takeover work.

    Therefore, I believe that as long as one's own will is firm, one stands firm, and is not influenced by the bourgeois ideas of selfishness, self-interest, corruption, and degeneration, even if one deals with private merchants and manages large amounts of money, one will not engage in embezzlement and illegal activities. Before and during the "Three-Anti" movement, many loyal, honest, and selfless model economic workers emerged. They are our role models, and we should learn from their revolutionary qualities, strengthen our own position, and do a good job in economic work for the people.

    张自凯来信说
    站稳立场就能打退奸商进攻
    编辑同志：我做经济工作已经好几年了，现在我在北京市信托公司工作。多年以来，我虽然经手了大批款项，和私商有过非常频繁的接触，但是我从来没有上过奸商的当。因此，我要以我自身的经历，来批驳董安平同志的“做经济工作难免被奸商拉下水”的错误认识。
    一九五○年春，我领导信托公司的几个同志去接管同庆公司的反革命分子的股份。我们到达该公司后，经理邓伯南就耍开了鬼把戏。他向我们献殷勤，请我们吃饭，看戏。他企图收买我们，以便从中隐匿敌产。当时我看得很明白，站稳了立场，没有受他的迷惑。我严肃地向他表示，一切必须按照政策法令办事，不能有半点含糊；我当场批评了他隐匿敌产的企图。我们在同庆公司住了一年多，一贯以认真负责的态度进行清查，终于胜利地完成了接管工作。
    因此，我认为：只要自己意志坚定，站稳立场，不受资产阶级自私自利和腐化堕落的思想影响，虽然和私商打交道，经管大批钱财，也不会发生贪污违法行为。在“三反”运动以前和运动之中，涌现了许多忠心耿耿廉洁奉公的模范经济工作人员，他们就是我们的榜样，我们应该学习他们的革命品质，坚定自己的立场，为人民作好经济工作。
