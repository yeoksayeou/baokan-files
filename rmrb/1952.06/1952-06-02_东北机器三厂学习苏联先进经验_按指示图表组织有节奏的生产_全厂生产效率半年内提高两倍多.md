Northeast Machine Factory No. 3 Learns from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union

Northeast Machine Factory No. 3, by learning from the advanced Soviet experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," has strengthened the organization and planning of production management, increasing the factory's production efficiency by more than two times in half a year.

The advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" is a scientific production management method from the socialist country of the Soviet Union. Its greatest advantage is that the monthly, daily, and production plans and actual completion status of each production team and each machine tool, as well as the preparation status of auxiliary production materials and tools, are marked on various instruction charts with red and blue lines. This allows all departments of the factory to organize themselves like a well-coordinated orchestra, completing production tasks evenly and rhythmically every day.

In the past, Machine Factory No. 3 had a serious abnormal phenomenon of "stopping work at the beginning of the month to wait for materials and rushing tasks at the end of the month" for a long time, and often failed to complete production tasks. From January to August of last year, the main product, lathes, only completed 53 percent of the plan, and the quality was poor, with all products being third-class or substandard, but the cost was very high, and the factory lost money every month. The main reason for this situation was inaccurate production plans and poor production organization, with various departments unable to coordinate well. In August of last year, the factory began to learn the advanced management methods of the Soviet Union's "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts." By April of this year, it had basically reversed the abnormal situation of past production, and the production landscape had been completely renewed. The output in the first quarter of this year exceeded the plan by 30 percent, which means that under the same equipment conditions (including workers and factories), it exceeded the total output of 1950. In April, the factory's output increased by nearly two times compared to January, and third-class products were completely eliminated. First-class products reached 67 percent of all products, and the cost was reduced by 17 percent compared to last year. The production balance rate has also greatly improved. In the past, lathes could not be produced at all in the first half of the month; now, finished products can be assembled and put into storage almost every day according to the daily plan.

In the process of implementing "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," the leading cadres of Machine Factory No. 3 first gained a relatively accurate understanding of the factory's production capacity and formulated accurate and detailed production plans. In the past, the production plans of each workshop in Machine Factory No. 3 were allocated according to the overall production plan of the factory, without being discussed by the workers, and without considering the inventory of raw materials and parts, the actual production capacity of machine tools and labor, and the length of the production cycle and the urgency of needs. Therefore, this plan was not realistic and often failed. This time, before formulating the plan, a thorough inventory was conducted of the exact number of parts and raw materials in the warehouse and workshop, and the actual production capacity of machine tools and labor was accurately calculated before the plan was drawn up.

Next, various instruction charts were established to implement the workshop operation plan, so as to grasp the production progress and make it clear to all employees of the factory. In a machine manufacturing factory, to make a working machine tool, it is necessary to carry out the processing and assembly of thousands of parts. Various preparation workshops and material supply departments must also carry out a series of tasks around processing and assembly. In the past, Machine Factory No. 3, like other machinery factories, was blind to the internal connections and coordination of the entire production process. Processing workshops often could not supply the needs of assembly workshops; raw material supply departments often could not meet the requirements of processing workshops. What was worse was that these situations could not be known in advance, and were only discovered when the assembly workshop or processing workshop could not continue to work due to the lack of certain parts or raw materials. This caused the phenomenon of stopping work to wait for materials at the beginning and rushing tasks by working overtime later. This time, after formulating the plan, the factory department first established four production instruction charts based on the spirit of the Soviet production instruction chart: "Product Assembly Plan and Completion Progress Chart," "Partial Assembly Plan and Completion Progress Chart," "Parts Collection Plan and Completion Progress Chart," and "Raw Materials Collection Plan and Completion Progress Chart." From these charts, the cadres began to understand that the production cycle from blanking to finished products takes more than two months, that is to say, this month's processing is for the assembly one or two months later, so they can foresee the completion of production tasks one or two months later, and can discover problems and weak links in advance, and find ways to solve them in time, in order to achieve a balance in the production of various departments. At the same time, the materials section, supply and marketing section, and other units also established various instruction charts, through which the work of all sections and workshops of the factory was closely linked. However, the above work was mainly focused on cadres above the section and workshop level, and cadres below the foreman and workers were still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the work of the workshop, implement the workshop operation plan, and make daily production plans for teams, groups, and individuals. This work was started by the processing workshop, which was the most complex and weakest at that time. The processing workshop planner formulated "Periodic Operation Standard Plan Table," "Machine Tool Task Table," and "Periodic Operation Load Table" according to the processing tasks given by the production section, according to the principle of specialization of labor, and according to the conditions of workshop equipment, labor, and work pieces. According to these charts, the workshop's operation plan was formulated, and the work sections, groups, and individuals also formulated "Team Production Progress Table." In this way, the state's plan was transformed into each worker's own plan. Each worker's daily struggle goal was clarified, so they could all strive to complete the production plan day by day according to the instruction charts. Machine Factory No. 3 has now established more than a dozen different instruction charts, and all employees and every link of the factory are carrying out rhythmic production according to these instruction charts.

Correctly mastering the amount of reserves and turnover is the key to ensuring rhythmic production. After Machine Factory No. 3 established various instruction charts, in order to enable the assembly workshop to carry out assembly rhythmically, a certain amount of "parts reserve" was maintained in the "parts general warehouse" according to the production cycle of the parts and the possibility of the parts being scrapped, and it was ensured that all the parts needed by the assembly workshop this month were completely processed and stored in the parts general warehouse before the end of last month. Similarly, in order to ensure the rhythmic production of the machining workshop, the blanks and forgings, castings, etc. required for processing this month were also prepared by the preparation workshop or material warehouse last month and stored in the "semi-finished product warehouse." At the same time, attention was also paid to maintaining an appropriate amount of turnover. At present, the factory adds up all the reserves and production occupation (including turnover), and the materials occupied by the entire factory each month are about three to four times the task of one month. This means that the materials needed for this month's products are prepared one quarter in advance.

The above steps are important methods for organizing rhythmic production. A further requirement is how to improve labor productivity and give full play to the potential strength of the enterprise. In this regard, Machine Factory No. 3 first achieved large-scale blanking to create conditions for the implementation of "specialization of labor." In the past, the amount of materials put into the processing workshop each time was too small, so most of the production time was consumed on auxiliary time such as changing tools and reversing processes, and labor productivity was very low. In March of this year, the factory's batch input increased by three and a half times compared to August of last year, which is one of the main reasons for the 53 percent reduction in the hourly quota (ie, the time required to manufacture a machine). Implementing "specialization of labor" is an important step to improve labor efficiency. In the third quarter of last year, Machine Factory No. 3 initially implemented fixed machines, fixed people, and fixed tasks, but did not achieve reasonable specialization of the same type. This time, tasks were assigned according to machine tool performance, work piece type, worker skill level, etc. Gear, casting, standard parts, long shaft, and small shaft groups were formed in the turning section, and flat gear shaft and bevel gear shaft, milling mouth and milling square groups were formed in the milling section. In this way, labor efficiency has been greatly improved. For example, after the second work section of the third workshop of the factory implemented "specialization of labor," labor productivity increased month by month, and increased by 39 percent in March compared to December of last year.

The second is to promote high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-edge cutting, and other advanced working methods. If "organizing rhythmic production" is not enriched by other advanced experiences, it will stagnate to a certain extent. Other advanced experiences can only be effectively organized and uniformly expressed in the entire production results on the basis of "organizing rhythmic production." Otherwise, if an advanced working method is created or learned in a certain process, it can only improve the efficiency of individual parts, and the overall production efficiency cannot be improved. Machine Factory No. 3 could not persist in the past, even though it had learned high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods for this reason. This time, after "organizing rhythmic production," in order to strengthen the weak links, multi-tool multi-edge cutting and high-speed cutting methods were promoted in the processing workshop, which resulted in an increase in production capacity of more than one time on the original basis. The processing workshop jumped from the weakest workshop in the entire factory to the workshop with the strongest production capacity in the entire factory. Foundry workers and forging workers must also absorb advanced experience and increase output in order to supply the needs of the processing workshop; the assembly workshop must also improve efficiency in order to balance with the processing capacity. Therefore, the factory is preparing to disseminate Yang Shoukun's sand casting experience and Liu Lifu's forging experience, and vigorously carry out the movement to find tricks to overcome new weak links, in order to further improve the overall production efficiency.

After the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" was spread in Machine Factory No. 3, it solved the phenomenon of front-end slack and back-end tight, and stopping work to wait for materials, which had never been solved in the machinery industry for several years. This is a major reform in mechanical production management, which can be widely promoted not only in the mechanical and electrical industries, but also in all production departments and basic construction departments. In order to vigorously promote this advanced working method, the Northeast Machinery Industry Administration, the Electrical Industry Administration, and the Northeast Machinery Trade Union Preparatory Committee have established a promotion committee, and have transferred more than 70 management cadres from various factories under their jurisdiction and opened a short-term training class to prepare for convening a promotion conference.

    东北机器三厂学习苏联先进经验
    “按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”全厂生产效率半年内提高两倍多
    东北机器三厂学习苏联“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验，加强了生产管理上的组织性和计划性，使全厂生产效率在半年内提高了两倍多。
    “按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验，是社会主义国家苏联的一种科学的生产管理方法。它的最大优点是把每月、每日、每一生产小组及每一台机床上的生产计划和实际完成情形，以及辅助生产的原材料、工具等准备工作的情况，用红蓝线记号标明在各种指示图表上，使全厂各部门都按这些指示图表组织得像一个配合得很好的演奏团一样，逐日均衡地、有节奏地完成生产任务。
    机器三厂过去长期存在着严重的“月初停工待料，月末突击任务”的不正常现象，经常完不成生产任务。去年一月到八月，主要产品——车床只完成计划百分之五十三，并且质量低劣，都是三级品和不合格品，但成本却很高，工厂月月赔钱。产生这种情况的主要原因是生产计划不准确，生产没有组织好，各部门不能很好地配合。去年八月，该厂开始学习苏联“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进管理方法，到今年四月，已基本上扭转了过去生产不正常的局面，生产面貌焕然一新。今年第一季度的产量超额百分之三十完成了计划，这就是说，在同样的设备条件（包括工人和厂房）下，超过了一九五零年全年的产量。四月份，该厂的产量又比一月份提高了将近两倍，并且完全消灭了三级品，一级品已达到全部产品的百分之六十七，成本也比去年降低了百分之十七；生产均衡率更是大大提高，过去上半月根本不能出产车床；现在，每天差不多都可以按照逐日计划装出成品入库。
    机器三厂在实行“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的过程中，领导干部首先对全厂生产能力做了一番比较准确的了解，制订出了准确、周密的生产计划。过去，机器三厂各车间的生产计划是按全厂总的生产计划分摊的，既不经过工人讨论，更不考虑库存原材料和部件的情况、机床和劳动力的实际生产能力，以及生产周期的长短和需要的急缓等条件。因而这种计划就不切合实际，常常落空。这次在制订计划之前，就先彻底清查了仓库和车间的部件及原材料的确实数目，并且把机床和劳动力的实际生产能力作了准确的计算，然后订出计划。
    接着是建立各种指示图表，贯彻车间作业计划，以掌握生产进度，使全厂职工心中有数。在机器制造厂里，要做出一台工作母机，需要进行千百个部件的加工和装配工作。各准备车间、材料供应部门也必须围绕加工、装配进行一系列的工作。过去机器三厂和其他机械工厂一样，在整个生产过程的内部联系、配合上是盲目的。加工车间往往供应不上装配车间的需要；原材料供应部门又时常满足不了加工车间的要求。更糟的是这些情况事先都无法知道，只有在装配车间或加工车间因为缺少某种部件或原材料而不能继续工作时才被发现。这就造成了开始只得停工待料、以后又得加班加点突击任务的现象。机器三厂这次在制订计划之后，厂部首先根据苏联生产指示图表的精神，建立了“产品装配计划与完成进度表”、“部分装配计划与完成进度表”、“零件搜集计划与完成进度表”、“原材料搜集计划与完成进度表”等四种生产指示图表。从这些图表中，干部们开始懂得了从下料到出成品的生产周期要两个月以上，也就是说，这个月的加工是为着一两个月以后的装配，因而也就预见到一两个月以后的生产任务完成情况，就可以事先发现问题，发现薄弱环节，及时设法解决，以求得各部门的生产均衡。与此同时，材料科、供销科等单位也建立了各种指示图表，通过这些指示图表，将全厂各科股和车间的工作密切地联系起来。但上述工作主要放在科和车间一级以上干部身上，工长以下干部和工人心中还是没数。因此，必须进一步加强车间工作，贯彻车间作业计划作出班、组和个人的逐日生产计划。这一工作是由该厂最复杂也是当时最薄弱的加工车间着手的。加工车间计划员根据生产科给予的加工任务，根据分工专业化的原则，根据车间设备、劳动力和工作物等条件制订出“周期作业标准计划表”、“机床担负任务表”和“周期作业负荷表”等。根据这些图表，制订出车间的作业计划，工段、小组、个人也都制订了“班组生产进度表”。这样，就把国家的计划变成了每个工人自己的计划。每个工人每天的奋斗目标明确了，因而也就都能按照指示图表争取逐日完成生产计划。机器三厂目前已建立了十几种不同的指示图表，全厂职工和每个环节都在按照这些指示图表进行着有节奏的生产。
    正确掌握储备量和周转量是保证进行有节奏生产的关键。机器三厂建立了各种指示图表之后，为使装配车间有节奏地进行装配，就在“零件总仓库”里按照部件生产循环期和部件作废可能性的大小，保持一定数量的“零件储备量”，并做到了这个月装配车间所需要的全部部件在上月底前全部加工完毕，存入零件总仓库。同样，为了保证机械加工车间有节奏的生产，这个月加工所需要的荒料和锻铸件等，也在上个月就已由准备车间或材料仓库准备妥当，存入“半成品仓库”。同时，也注意了保持适当的周转量。目前，该厂将所有的储备量和生产占用量（包括周转量）加起来，每月全厂所占用的材料约等于一个月任务的三倍到四倍。这也就是说，本月产品所需要的材料，在一个季度以前就准备好了。
    以上几个步骤是组织有节奏生产的重要方法，再进一步就要求如何提高劳动生产率，充分发挥企业的潜在力量。在这一方面，机器三厂首先做到大批下料，为实行“分工专业化”创造条件。过去每次投入加工车间的材料数量太少，因而大部生产时间都消耗在换工具、倒工序等辅助时间上，劳动生产率很低。今年三月份该厂成批投入量比去年八月份增加了三倍半，这是使台时定额（即制造一台机器所需的时间）降低百分之五十三的主要原因之一。实行“分工专业化”是提高劳动效率的重要步骤。机器三厂在去年第三季度已初步实行定机、定人、定活，但未作到合理的同类型专业化分工。这次，又根据机床性能、工作物类型、工人技术水平等分配任务。在车工工段组成了齿轮、铸件、标准件、长轴及小轴等组，在铣工工段组成了平齿轮轴和斜齿轴、铣口和铣方等组。这样，就使得劳动效率大大提高。如该厂第三车间第二工段，实行“分工专业化”后，劳动生产率逐月上升，三月份较去年十二月份提高了百分之三十九。
    其次是推广高速切削法、多刀多刃切削法和其他先进工作方法。“组织有节奏的生产”如果没有其他先进经验来充实其内容，它将在一定程度上，停滞不前。而其他各种先进经验也只有在“组织有节奏的生产”的基础上，才能把它们有效地组织起来，统一表现在整个生产成果上。否则，某一工序创造了或学习了先进的工作方法，仅能使个别部件提高效率，总的生产效率并不能提高。机器三厂就因为这种原因，过去虽然学习了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，但不能坚持下来。这次“组织有节奏的生产”后，为了加强薄弱环节，就在加工车间推广了多刀多刃切削法和高速切削法，结果使生产能力在原有基础上提高了一倍以上，加工车间由原来全厂最薄弱的车间，一跃而为全厂生产能力最强的车间。铸工、锻工也必须吸取先进经验，提高产量，才能供应加工车间的需要；装配车间也必须提高效率，才能与加工能力平衡。因此，该厂已准备传播杨守训的翻砂经验和刘立富的锻工经验，大力开展找窍门运动，来克服新的薄弱环节，以求更进一步提高整个的生产效率。
    “按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验，在机器三厂传播后，解决了机械工业几年来从未解决的前松后紧、停工待料现象。这是机械生产管理上的一项重大改革，不仅在机械电工工业中可以普遍推广，而且其基本原则也适用于一切生产部门和基本建设部门。为大力推广这项先进工作方法，东北机械工业管理局、电器工业管理局和东北机械工会筹备委员会等单位已成立了推广委员会，并于日前抽调所属各厂管理干部七十余人，开办了短期训练班，准备召开推广大会。
