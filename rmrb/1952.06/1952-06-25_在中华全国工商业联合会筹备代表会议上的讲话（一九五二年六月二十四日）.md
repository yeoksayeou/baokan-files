Comrade Chen Yun, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, Chairman of the Presidium, esteemed delegates, and gentlemen:

    Today, on behalf of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, I extend my congratulations on the convening of the Preparatory Representative Meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and would like to share some economic information and opinions with you all.

    I remember that shortly after the founding of the Central People's Government, when our financial and economic situation was still in serious difficulty, Chairman Mao instructed us that we had difficulties, but we also had solutions and hope. He encouraged us to strive to fundamentally improve the national financial and economic situation within three years or a little longer. In the past two or three years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, governments at all levels and the people of the whole country have united as one, overcome numerous difficulties, and steadily improved the national financial and economic situation, achieving a balance of revenue and expenditure, stabilizing finance and prices, and enabling production and trade to develop steadily on a solid foundation. We have overcome the difficulties encountered by industry and commerce in the process of reorganization after price stabilization and launched a movement for exchange between urban and rural areas, creating favorable conditions for the rapid recovery of industrial and agricultural production. Recently, we launched the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to eliminate the "three evils" and "five poisons" left over from the old society that hindered our country's progress. We expect that after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, all legitimate industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood will achieve further development on a new basis.

    In the past two or three years, the recovery of our agricultural and industrial production has reached our expected requirements. In terms of agricultural production, we have generally recovered and partially exceeded the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels. Taking the total output of 1949 as 100, the total output of 1951 has increased to 128, and this year it is expected to reach 137, which will restore the average annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The output of major grains such as wheat and rice will exceed the average annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The increase in cotton production is even more significant. Taking the total output of 1949 as 100, the total output of 1951 has increased to 252, and this year's expected output will exceed last year's. In this way, our country's cotton output will far exceed the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The output of other agricultural products has also increased significantly in the past three years. Due to the recovery of agricultural production and its exceeding the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels, we can no longer rely on imported rice, wheat, and cotton, but rely entirely on our own production to meet the needs of the people and industrial production nationwide.

    In terms of industrial production, we have also recovered and partially exceeded the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels. Our heavy industry was originally very immature and suffered serious damage during the war. Now we have restored it and carried out preliminary adjustments. This year, the expected output of major products such as coal, iron, steel ingots, steel materials, and machinery can approach or even exceed the highest annual output in Chinese history. The recovery of light industry is equally significant. Taking the cotton yarn output of 1949 as 100, the cotton yarn output of 1951 has increased to 124, and this year it is expected to reach over 162, which has also exceeded the annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In addition, industries such as papermaking and rubber have also developed significantly. Even the most difficult cigarette industry's planned output this year will far exceed the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels. Now our light industry still has considerable potential, and our industrial products have an expanding domestic market. Therefore, its continued development is fully guaranteed.

    In addition to the recovery of production, we have also begun to carry out some large-scale construction projects at an unprecedented speed in Chinese history. For example, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Sichuan had been looking forward to for decades since the late Qing Dynasty but had not been built, has now been completed in two years and will be open to traffic on July 1st. The Longhai Railway can also reach Lanzhou in October this year. The great Huai River water conservancy project, which began last year, and the Jingjiang flood diversion project, which began this year, are unprecedented in Chinese history and rare in the world in terms of scale and speed. Of course, from the long-term perspective of China's economic construction, we have only taken the first step of a long march of ten thousand miles. It is entirely foreseeable that our tasks will be more arduous than they are now.

    In the past two or three years, we have not only successfully completed the economic recovery work, but also successfully carried out the adjustment and transformation of industry and commerce. With the end of inflation and the stabilization of prices, speculative trade, which was rampant for a time, gradually disappeared. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements are a social reform movement to change customs and habits, and also a movement to further transform industry and commerce. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the "three evils" and "five poisons" that eroded government organs, harmed national construction, and hindered social progress have been largely eliminated, which has created extremely favorable conditions for national economic construction and the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. From now on, industrialists and businessmen will be able to concentrate more on developing production and improving management. The enthusiasm of workers and staff for production and work will also be greatly improved. Therefore, private industry and commerce do have a future, and their future is brighter than in the past.

    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have brought a new look to the country. We need to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and labor-capital relations on a new basis, and thus some new problems have emerged that need to be resolved quickly and properly.

    The first is the issue of reasonable profits for processing orders. We believe that most of the labor and material costs and prices stipulated in our processing orders in the past were appropriate. However, some cost estimates were too high, resulting in excessive profits; others were the opposite, resulting in too little profit. We believe that those that were appropriately stipulated in the past should remain unchanged; those that were too high or too low should be adjusted appropriately. The "Five-Anti" movement revealed that many factories had falsely reported costs and sought exorbitant profits; the labor and material costs and prices of these factories should be appropriately reduced. However, some processing order contracts newly signed after the "Five-Anti" movement have stipulated labor and material costs and prices that are too low, which should be appropriately increased. The Central Ministry of Trade has urged local trade agencies to re-examine these new contracts, correctly calculate costs, and ensure that private factories receive the profits they deserve. There is currently a possibility of appropriately increasing the labor costs for cotton yarn, which has been adjusted by the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation from the first of this month.

    Everyone has requested the formulation of a reasonable standard for the profit of state processing orders. We believe that due to the different supply and demand situations of various commodities, the need to take into account the interests of manufacturers, sellers, and consumers, and the need to take care of the stability of market prices, it is difficult to stipulate a unified standard. However, it may be possible to propose a general outline, which is roughly to ensure that private factories, based on their capital, can obtain profits of about 10%, about 20%, or about 30% per year under normal and reasonable management, according to different circumstances. This profit is calculated based on the average standard of normal and reasonable management. Some factories with low costs and high quality can get more profit. Conversely, some factories with high costs and low quality will get less profit than this. This is the standard for the profit of state processing orders. We do not intend to use this standard to limit the profit amount of general private industry and commerce. If private industry and commerce, because of improving management and reducing costs, adapt to social needs, abide by state regulations, and take into account the people's consumption capacity, some profits exceeding this regulation are also acceptable and permissible.

    The second is the issue of the specifications of processing orders. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, it was found that some private factories had cut corners in manufacturing state processing orders, and many government personnel had also accepted bribes and embezzled. Therefore, the ordering agencies are now more serious in accepting goods than in the past. This is as it should be. However, because the specifications in some contracts are very vague and lack clear standards, some inspection personnel have been overly critical and rejected too many substandard products. We have ordered local finance committees to pay attention to inspection, and the Central Ministry of Trade is also preparing to hold specification meetings for relevant industries in major cities in the near future, inviting relevant departments such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, various processing enterprises, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and trade unions to participate, and to discuss specific processing order specifications as acceptance standards in accordance with the actual situation of each industry in each region. At the same time, major cities are also preparing to organize review committees for processing orders under the leadership of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, absorbing relevant departments such as various ordering agencies, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and trade unions, to handle disputes in acceptance.

    The third is how to invigorate urban-rural exchange and domestic-foreign exchange. During the most intense period of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, there was some stagnation in industry and commerce. For this reason, state trade organizations vigorously carried out processing orders, which quickly improved the market situation. However, many industrial products in major cities have not been sold, while small cities and rural markets in the interior feel the lack of industrial products and the stagnation of some local products. This shows that we still need to vigorously promote urban-rural exchange. Recently, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places held urban-rural material exchange conferences, which have achieved significant results. The good experiences they have gained should be further promoted to various places. At the same time, the Central Ministry of Trade is adjusting the regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences of general commodities. State-owned retail still aims to stabilize the market, so that legitimate private commerce can participate in material exchange. The rural prices of local products should not be raised too high, nor should they be lowered too low. Production and sales must be taken care of, and public and private commerce and cooperatives should jointly participate in urban-rural and domestic-foreign exchange.

    The fourth is the issue of bank interest rates. For several years, interest rates on bank loans in our country have been very high, which has had an adverse impact on the development of industry and commerce. The reason why bank deposit and loan interest rates were so high in the past was because prices were unstable. In the past two years, finance and prices have gradually stabilized, so the time is ripe to lower bank interest rates. Recently, we have lowered bank interest rates and expanded the scope of loans to private industry and commerce as much as possible. Needless to say, this is of great benefit to the national industry and commerce. It is hoped that the public and private sectors will work together to implement the policy of lowering interest rates.

    The fifth is the issue of taxation. Some cities have reported that our calculation of income tax for individual industries and manufacturers this year is too high, and the attitude of individual tax officials is not good. We have ordered local finance committees to conduct serious inspections. For those whose tax calculation for individual industries and manufacturers is inappropriate, either too high or too low, they can apply for review by the local tax review committee, and the excess will be refunded and the deficiency will be made up. The selection of typical industrial and commercial households for democratic appraisal should be negotiated to ensure appropriateness. Tax officials have the responsibility to collect taxes in accordance with national tax laws. It is right to strictly abide by the tax collection responsibilities in order to prevent tax evasion, but illegal tax evasion should be dealt with according to law, and other inappropriate methods should not be adopted.

    Our current tax law was drafted in June 1950 at the tax conference through consultation between the government and representatives of private industry and commerce. This tax law is generally in line with the actual situation in our country. The results of its implementation in the past two years have not only guaranteed the state's financial revenue, but also greatly developed our country's industry and commerce. Some representatives of industry and commerce have also put forward some opinions on our tax law. We will pay attention to and study these opinions, and those that do not affect the state's financial needs and can and should be modified can be considered for modification.

    The sixth is the issue of labor-capital relations. At present, there are two situations in labor-capital relations. In some private enterprises, especially large enterprises, labor-capital relations are generally normal. Some large enterprises have improved labor-capital relations because the capitalists have improved the welfare of employees, and the enthusiasm of employees for production has increased. In other private enterprises, especially some small workshops and shops, labor-capital relations are not normal. Some capitalists are dissatisfied with the employees' reporting of their "five poisons" and retaliate by stopping meals and wages; some employees have made excessive demands during the "Five-Anti" movement because of the excessively poor treatment they received in the past. All these abnormal situations should be adjusted. Acts of retaliation against employees must be stopped. The demands made by employees must be suitable for the possible situation of the enterprise operation and cannot be too high. The property of the capitalists should be protected, and the powers of operation, management, and personnel deployment in the enterprise belong to the capitalists, but they should abide by government laws and regulations. The treatment of employees should be improved as much as possible and appropriately. Disputes between labor and capital should continue to be resolved through mutual consultation and the signing of collective contracts. It is hoped that labor-capital consultation meetings can be held regularly to discuss production reform, democratic reform, and the reasonable demands of workers, so as to achieve the goals of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital.

    The seventh is the issue of preventing the "three evils" and "five poisons." The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the past few months are an unprecedented large-scale movement to transform state organs and transform industry and commerce. The purpose is to eliminate the "three evils" and "five poisons" that erode government organs, harm national construction, and hinder social progress, and to create a favorable condition for national construction. During the movement, the "three evils" of many government personnel and the "five poisons" of many private industrialists and businessmen were exposed, or they confessed themselves, proving that the harm of the "three evils" and "five poisons" is very great. The Central People's Government has adopted a policy of appropriate leniency and severity to deal with them. Government personnel and private industrialists and businessmen across the country must pay attention: all government personnel who serve the people wholeheartedly, and all industrialists and businessmen who abide by state laws and operate in a way that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood will be encouraged by the government. Those who commit the "three evils" and "five poisons" again will be severely punished by the government and the people.

    With the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the proper resolution of these problems, our industry and commerce will usher in a new era of prosperity. The reasons are: first, the scale of our country's economic construction this year is larger than last year, and our investment in construction is more than last year; second, in terms of industrial production, state-owned factories have generally completed their production plans in the first half of the year. Private factories, the more important industries and factories, were in normal production even during the "Five-Anti" period. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the labor productivity of some factories has greatly improved. The output of various industrial products this year will undoubtedly significantly exceed last year; third, agricultural production is also continuing to develop. This year's wheat harvest is also good, the tea harvest is as good as last year, and silk exceeds last year. Judging from the situation in the first half of the year, agricultural production this year is more promising than last year. All these indicate that the purchasing power of the people will rise. Therefore, we expect that after the summer harvest and autumn harvest, the market situation will quickly become active. As long as government personnel eliminate the "three evils" and private enterprises prevent the "five poisons," and under the leadership of the state-owned economy, abide by the state's economic policies, the future prosperity will be a healthier prosperity. It is hoped that public and private industrialists and businessmen can make good use of past experiences and welcome the coming autumn and winter peak season.

    In the past two or three years, we have successfully completed the work of restoring and transforming our people's economy. In the future, we will enter a large-scale planned economic construction to industrialize our country. Industrialists and businessmen across the country have already made contributions in the past economic recovery work, and will still shoulder important responsibilities in the great economic construction in the future. It is hoped that industrialists and businessmen across the country can work together with the government to complete this glorious historical task.

    在中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的讲话
    （一九五二年六月二十四日）
    政务院财政经济委员会主任　陈云主席团，各位代表、各位先生：
    今天，我代表政务院财政经济委员会，来祝贺全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的召开，并向各位代表讲一些经济情况和意见。
    记得中央人民政府成立不久，我们的财政经济尚处于严重困难情况的时候，毛主席曾指示我们，说我们是有困难的，但是有办法、有希望的，并勉励我们努力在三年或三年多一点的时期内，争取国家财政经济的基本好转。两三年来，我们各级政府和全国人民在毛主席英明的领导下，团结一致，克服了重重困难，使国家的财政经济情况日益好转，达到财政收支平衡，金融物价稳定，使生产和贸易得以在巩固的基础上日益发展。我们已克服了在物价稳定后，工商业在改组过程中所遇到的困难，并开展城乡交流运动，替工业和农业生产的迅速恢复创造了有利的条件。最近我们又开展了“三反”、“五反”运动，消除从旧社会遗留下来的阻碍我们国家前进的“三害”和“五毒”，我们预期在“三反”、“五反”运动以后，一切正当的有利于国计民生的工商业，将要在新的基础上获得进一步的发展。
    两三年来，我国农业和工业生产的恢复，已达到了我们预期的要求。在农业生产方面，我们大体上已恢复并部分地超过了抗日战争前的水平。就粮食来讲，如以一九四九年的总产量为一○○，则一九五一年的总产量已增加到一二八，今年预期可以达到一三七，将要恢复到抗日战争前的平均年产量，其中小麦和大米等主要粮食将要超过抗日战争前的平均年产量。棉花的增产更加显著，如以一九四九年的总产量为一○○，则一九五一年的总产量已增加到二五二，今年预期的产量又会超过去年，这样，我国棉花的产量就远超过了抗日战争前的最高年产量。其它农产品的产量，三年来也有同样显著的增长。由于农业生产的恢复并超过抗日战争前的水平，使我们可以不再依靠从外国运来的洋米、洋麦、洋棉，完全依靠自己的生产来满足全国人民和工业生产的需要。
    在工业生产方面，我们也同样已经恢复并部分超过抗日战争前的水平。我们的重工业原来是很幼稚的，战争中又受到了严重的破坏；现在我们已经把它恢复起来，并进行了初步的调整。今年煤、铁、钢锭、钢材、机器等主要产品的预期产量，有的可以接近，有的可以超过中国历史上的最高年产量。轻工业的恢复同样显著，就最有代表性的纺织工业来讲，如以一九四九年的棉纱产量为一○○，则一九五一年的棉纱产量已增加到一二四，今年预期可以到达一六二以上，也已超过抗日战争前的年产量。此外如造纸、橡胶等工业，都有显著的发展；就连最困难的卷烟工业，今年的计划产量也将要远超过抗日战争前的水平。现在我们的轻工业还有着相当大的潜在力量，我们的工业生产品又有着日益扩大的国内市场，因此它的继续发展是完全有保证的。
    除生产的恢复外，我们还开始以中国历史上空前的速度，进行着某些规模巨大的建设工程。如从满清末年以来四川人民盼望了几十年而没有兴修的成渝铁路，现在以两年的时间即已建设完成，下月一日即可通车；陇海铁路在今年十月也可以通到兰州。从去年开始的伟大的淮河水利工程，和今年开始的荆江分洪工程，按其规模和进行速度来讲，不但在中国历史上是空前的，即在世界上也是少见的。当然从中国经济建设的远大前途来讲，我们还只走了万里长征的第一步；今后我们的任务将比现在更加繁重，那是完全可以预料得到的。
    两三年来，我们不但胜利地完成了经济恢复工作，而且胜利地进行了工商业的调整和改造工作。跟着通货膨胀的停止和物价的稳定，曾经猖狂一时的投机贸易也就逐渐归于消灭了。“三反”、“五反”是一个移风易俗的社会改革运动，同时也是进一步改造工商业的运动。在“三反”、“五反”运动之后，一切腐蚀政府机关，危害国家建设，阻碍社会前进的“三害”和“五毒”，已被大量扫除出去，这对国家经济建设和正当的私营工商业的发展，创造了一个极为有利的条件。此后，工商业者将可更专心致志于发展生产，改善经营；职工们生产和工作的积极性也将大大提高。因此，私营工商业不是没有前途，它们的前途是比过去更加光明了。
    “三反”、“五反”运动使全国气象焕然一新，我们需要在新的基础上来调整公私关系、劳资关系，因而也就出现了一些新的问题，有待于我们来迅速地、妥善地给以解决。
    首先是加工订货的合理利润问题。过去我们加工订货所规定的工缴和货价，我们认为大多数是恰当的。但是有一部分成本估计过高，利润过大；还有一部分则与此相反，利润过小。我们认为过去规定得恰当的，应该保持原状；过大和过小的，则应该作适当的调整。在“五反”运动中发现了不少工厂有虚报成本、牟取暴利的现象；这些工厂的工缴和货价应该适当地降低。但是“五反”后新签订的加工订货合同，也有把工缴和货价规定得偏低的，这些就应该适当地提高。中央贸易部已督促各地贸易机关重新审查这些新合同，正确核算成本，保证私营工厂获得它们所应得的利润。棉纱的工缴，目前已有适当提高的可能，已经由花纱布公司从本月一日起加以调整。
    大家要求规定一个国家加工订货的利润的合理标准，我们认为由于各种货品的供求情况不同，由于需要兼顾制造者、贩卖者与消费者三方面的利益，又要照顾到市场物价的稳定，因此规定一个统一的标准是有困难的。但也不妨提出一个大概的轮廓，这轮廓大体上就是按照不同情况，保证私营工厂按其资本计算，在正常合理经营的情况下每年获得百分之十左右，百分之二十左右，到百分之三十左右的利润。这个利润是按正常合理经营的中等标准来计算的。某些工厂成本低、质量高，便可以得到比较多的利润。反之，某些工厂成本高、质量低，它们所得到的利润便会比这低一点。这是国家加工订货的利润的标准，我们并不准备用这标准来限死一般私营工商业的利润数额。私营工商业，如果因为改善经营、降低成本，在适应社会需要，遵守国家规定，又照顾了人民消费能力的情况下，有些利润超过这个规定也是可以的，容许的。
    第二是加工订货的规格问题。在“三反”、“五反”运动中，检查出过去某些私营工厂在承制国家的加工订货的时候，有偷工减料的现象，公务人员中也有许多受贿贪污分子。因此，现在订货机关在验收货品的时候，比过去认真了。这是应该的。但因有些合同上对规格的规定很不具体，缺乏明确的标准，因此亦发生了某些验收人员挑剔过严、剔出次货过多的现象。我们已令各地财委注意检查，中央贸易部亦准备于最近两月在各大城市分别召开有关各业的规格会议，请工商局、各加工企业、工商联和工会等有关部门来参加，按照各地各业的实际情形商订具体的加工订货规格，作为验收标准。同时各大城市也准备在工商局领导下，吸收各订货机关，工商联和工会等有关部门，组织加工订货的评议委员会，来处理验收中的争论问题。
    第三是如何活泼城乡交流、内外交流。在“三反”、“五反”运动最紧张的时期，工商业曾有部分呆滞的现象，为此，国家贸易机构大力进行加工订货，使市场情况迅速好转。但是现在各大城市还有许多工业品没有推销出去，内地小城市和农村市场则感到工业品的缺乏，和某些土产品的滞销。这说明我们还需要大力推广城乡交流。最近天津、上海等地召开城乡物资交流大会，均已获得显著成绩；它们所获得的好的经验，应该进一步向各地推广。同时中央贸易部正在调整一般商品的地区差价和批发零售差价，国营零售仍以稳定市场为度，使正当的私营商业参加物资交流。土产品的农村价格不宜提得过高，亦不宜压得过低；必须既照顾生产，又照顾销路，公私商业和合作社应该共同参加城乡内外交流。
    第四是银行利息问题。若干年来，我国银行贷款的利息是很高的，这对工商业的发展有不利的影响。过去银行存放款的利息所以如此高，原因是物价不稳定。两年来金融物价是逐渐稳定了，因此降低银行利息的时机已经成熟了。最近我们已经降低银行利息，并尽可能扩大对私营工商业贷款的范围，不待说，这对全国工商业的好处是很大的。希望公私共同协力，来实现降低利息的政策。
    第五是税收问题。若干城市反映，我们今年徵收所得税对个别行业厂商计算偏高，个别税务人员态度不好。我们已令各地财委认真检查，对个别行业厂商计税不当，偏高偏低者，可以经由各地税务复议委员会，进行复议，多退少补。对于民主评议的工商业户，选择典型应该经过协商，力求适当。税务人员负有按照国家税法徵收税款的责任，为了防止偷漏税款而严守徵税责任是应该的，但对于违法漏税分子，应该依法处理，而不应采取其他不适当的办法。
    我们的现行税法，是一九五○年六月税务会议中，政府和私营工商业代表协商草拟的。这个税法大体上是合乎我国现在的实际情况的，两年来执行的结果，不但保证了国家的财政收入，同时也大大发展了我国的工商业。某些工商业代表对我们的税法也提出了一些意见，对这些意见，我们将加以重视和研究，凡属不影响国家的财政需要而可能和应当修改者，可以考虑加以修改。
    第六是劳资关系问题。目前劳资关系存在着两种情况。在一部分私营企业中，首先是大的企业中，劳资关系一般是正常的。有些大企业由于资方对职工福利有所改进，职工的生产积极性提高了，因此劳资关系更加融洽了。在另一部分私营企业中，特别是一部分小的作坊、商店中，劳资关系则是不正常的。有的资方因为不满意职工检举他的“五毒”，心怀报复，实行停伙、停薪；也有一部分职工，由于过去所受的待遇过分恶劣，所以在“五反”运动时，提出了过高的要求。所有这些不正常状态，都应加以调整。报复职工的行为，必须制止。职工所提的要求，必须适合于企业经营的可能情况，不能过高。资方的财产，应受保护，对于企业中经营管理和人事调配的职权，属于资方，但应遵守政府的法令。职工的待遇应作可能和适当的改善。劳资之间的争议，应该继续采取双方协商，订立集体合同。并希望劳资协商会议能经常开会讨论有关生产改革、民主改革及工人的合理要求，以便达到发展生产，劳资两利的目的。
    第七是关于防止“三害”和“五毒”问题。过去几个月的“三反”、“五反”运动，是改造国家机关和改造工商业的一个历史上空前的大运动，目的是要把腐蚀政府机关、危害国家建设、阻碍社会前进的“三害”和“五毒”除去，为国家建设创造一种有利的条件。在运动中，许多公务人员的“三害”和许多私营工商业者的“五毒”被揭发了，或自己坦白了，证明“三害”、“五毒”的为害是很大的。中央人民政府已采取了宽严适当的方针加以处理。全国公务人员和全国私营工商业者必须注意：一切全心全意为人民服务的公务人员，一切遵守国家法令经营有利于国计民生的工商业者将得到政府的鼓励。再犯“三害”和“五毒”的分子，必将受到政府和人民的严惩。
    随着“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利结束，和这些问题的妥善解决，我们的工商业将要出现新的繁荣气象。理由是：首先，今年我们国家的经济建设规模比去年更大，我们在建设方面的投资比去年更多；其次，工业生产方面，国营工厂上半年大体上均完成生产计划，私营工厂中较重要的行业和较重要的工厂即在“五反”时期，也是正常生产的，有些工厂在“五反”之后，劳动生产率大大提高了，今年各种工业品的产量无疑地均将很显著地超过去年；再次，农业生产也是继续有发展的，今年麦子又是丰收，茶叶与去年一样好，蚕丝超过去年。从上半年的情况来看，今年的农业生产比较去年更有希望。所有这些都说明人民的购买力将是上升的。因此，我们预料在夏收、秋收以后，市场情况即将迅速活跃起来。只要公务人员清除“三害”，私营企业防止“五毒”，在国营经济领导之下，遵守国家的经济政策，则今后的繁荣将是更健全的繁荣。希望公私工商业者均能好好利用以往的经验，迎接即将到来的秋冬旺季。
    我们在过去的两三年中，已经胜利地完成了我国人民经济的恢复和改造的工作，今后我们将要进入大规模的有计划的经济建设，使我们的国家工业化。全国的工商业者在以往的经济恢复工作中，已经有了贡献；在今后伟大的经济建设中，仍将担负重要的责任。希望全国工商业家能与政府共同努力，来完成这历史上的光荣任务。
