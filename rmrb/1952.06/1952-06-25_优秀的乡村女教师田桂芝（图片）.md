Excellent Rural Female Teacher Tian Guizhi
Chen Jinyan (painting)

(Seven) She felt difficulties, but she was not intimidated by them. She remembered the encouragement given to her by the Communist Party District Committee comrades and Principal Yin: "Revolutionaries have no difficulties that cannot be overcome." She mustered her courage and resolved to continue.

(Eight) The classroom was leaking rain, and the villagers were busy with farming, so it was not convenient to ask them for help with repairs. Tian Guizhi said, "Let's repair it ourselves." So she led the students, mud and sweat, to repair the school building. In winter, the school had no firewood to burn, so she led the students to the mountains to chop firewood in the wind and snow.

(Nine) Tian Guizhi's work ethic moved the villagers. The following spring, they allocated a plot of school land to the school. Tian Guizhi led the students to the fields, taking care of everything from spring plowing to autumn harvest, without bothering anyone else. Everyone's view of her changed, saying, "She's extraordinary; the teacher can do anything!"

    （七）她感到困难了，但她没有被困难吓倒。她记得共产党区委同志和尹校长对她的勉励：“革命者没有克服不了的困难。”她鼓起了勇气，下决心干下去。
    （八）教室漏雨，老乡们正在农忙中，不好请老乡们帮着修理。田桂芝说：“咱们自个儿修吧。”她就领着学生一把泥一把汗地把校舍修补好。冬天，学校没柴烧，她又领着学生们冒着风雪上山砍柴。
    （九）田桂芝的工作精神感动了老乡们。第二年春天，他们拨给学校一垧学田。田桂芝领着学生们下地了，从春耕到秋收，没让别人操过心。大家对她的看法改变了，说：“不简单，老师什么都能干！”
