Letters from Model Grain Producers from Various Regions

Editor's Note: On March 16th of this year, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued an order to commend many model villages, model agricultural production cooperatives, model mutual aid teams, and model farmers in various regions who created new records in the patriotic agricultural production increase movement in 1951. After the list of the first batch of award winners was announced, our newspaper successively received more than forty letters from the award recipients. They unanimously stated that this honor should first belong to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and all working people, because this was the prerequisite for them to create record yields. They believe that this kind of reward has great educational significance, and it has encouraged and promoted farmers in various regions to organize and increase production. They stated that they will unite the masses, work harder in production, and create even higher production records in the future. Now, we have selected six letters from these forty-plus letters to publish below:

Model Millet Producer Zhang Tushu

Loving the New Society and Creating Record Yields

Editor Comrades: I am an old farmer, already fifty-eight years old this year. I never thought I would receive an award from the Central People's Government. If my wife could see this honor, I don't know how happy she would be; but she starved to death thirteen years ago along with my fourth son. That year, my family had seven people, farming six mu of land, and the harvest was not bad. But the traitorous army took all the grain from my family and also beat my second son to death. We were all starving like paper dolls. After my wife and fourth son starved to death, I gave one of my boys away, and the remaining three went out to flee the famine. Thinking of these past events really makes my heart ache. I have a personal hatred for the old society, and I feel particularly good about the new society. In 1946, my village was liberated. To defend the whole village, I became the squad leader of the militia, and my son became the armed forces minister. In 1948, the village implemented land reform, and my family was allocated another four mu of land, which, together with the original six mu, totaled ten mu. My whole family worked hard in production, and the ten mu of land yielded a good harvest every year. We had enough to eat and wear, and we were no longer bullied. Last year, I organized a mutual aid team, and the problems that could not be solved by working alone were solved. I could also spare time to specialize in production technology. As a result, the one mu and one fen of millet I planted yielded 1,124 jin. I understand very well that without the help of the People's Government and various aspects, this high yield and this honor would not have been possible. In the future, I will not only run the mutual aid team well, but also run the entire village's production well. Now there are fifty-one mutual aid teams in the whole village, and forty of them have already established production increase plans. I also plan to regularly go to the county's farm to learn advanced technology, and also exchange high-yield experiences of various crops in different seasons with various villages.

Model Millet Producer Chi Wanku

Determined to Lead the Masses in the Whole Village in Active Production

Editor Comrades: I am already sixty-seven years old this year. I suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society. When I was fifteen years old, I worked as a young farmhand for the landlord, with no food or clothing, and was bullied every day. When I was seventeen years old, I went to learn the craft of a cobbler. For a full nine years, I only did odd jobs and didn't learn anything. When I was twenty-six years old, I started driving a cart for the landlord, and drove for eighteen years. After that, I relied on renting land and lived that poor life in a muddle. At that time, who regarded farmers as human beings!

In 1948, our area was liberated, and the farmers finally raised their heads and stood up. Although I was getting on in years, my mind was not old. Last year, we had a drought here. I listened to the words of the People's Government and cultivated carefully and fought the drought by carrying water. As a result, we not only overcame the drought, but also achieved a high yield. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the provincial and county governments rewarded me, making me so happy that I didn't know what to say. I am now determined to work harder on the production front. Last winter, I returned from attending the provincial labor model conference and understood the benefits of being organized. I took the lead in organizing a labor exchange mutual aid team, which led one hundred and seventy-five households in the village to participate in the labor exchange mutual aid team (out of a total of two hundred and fifteen households in the village). Now there are thirty-eight teams in the whole village. The production enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village is very high, and they have proposed to strive to become a high-yield village this year.

At the county's expanded production conference, Chairman Yang Gengtian of the province called on the masses in the whole county to learn from me. In the past few days, some villages have sent challenge letters, some villages have written letters asking about high-yield experience, and some have personally come to my home to study production technology. The masses in various villages have great hopes for me, but I feel that I am far from enough. I must do my best. In addition to doing a good job in the high-yield movement with the masses in the whole village, I must also take time to help other villages to improve production as well. We must produce more grain to support the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea!

Model Corn Producer Han Liuhaizi

Helping the Masses Overcome Conservative Thinking

Editor Comrades: On April 28th, our county held an award ceremony. County Chief Liu personally presented me with the award on behalf of the People's Government, and various government departments and organizations sent me many congratulatory telegrams and congratulatory messages. The elementary school students presented me with flowers. I was so happy that I couldn't speak. I, a farmer from a hired worker background, can receive today's honor because Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led the people's revolution and also led the people to work hard in production. Therefore, I feel that the honor should belong to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and all working people. At the award ceremony, I reported my corn high-yield experience to nearly one thousand mutual aid team representatives who attended the meeting. The representatives realized that the idea of ​​"production reaching the top" is wrong. For example, Representative Li Zonghuai said: "I originally thought that in our place, the most corn that could be harvested per mu since ancient times was six or seven hundred jin. Today, after listening to Han Liuhaizi's high-yield experience, my conservative thinking was broken. He plans to harvest 1,200 jin this year. I must learn from him and strive for a good harvest for the whole team this year." Wang Jinming said: "I believe that we have not fully exploited the potential of the land. As long as we organize and improve technology, it is possible to produce more grain per mu. We must learn from the high-yield experience and achieve comprehensive high yields." On the spot, labor model Fan Jinde, on behalf of 452 mutual aid teams in the first district, jointly challenged me for the patriotic high-yield competition proposed to the whole province. They guaranteed that 79 high-yield teams and 625 high-yield households would emerge in the whole district this year, and they would create high-yield records on 5,909 mu of land. Representatives from the other two districts and three districts also expressed their challenges to me.

Although I have won the title of model corn producer, I must not be complacent. I must continue to study, improve technology, and produce more corn. Now my mutual aid team has expanded by five households. Everyone has a democratic discussion and launched a production inspection campaign to achieve high yields.

Model Rice Producer Li Youan

Eliminating Farmers' Concerns About Increasing Production

Editor Comrades: Last year, some farmer brothers in our village still looked at the new society with the eyes of the old society. Obviously, production increased, but they didn't dare to report the truth, fearing that reporting more would mean more burdens. In fact, my land not only did not have more burdens after the high yield, but also received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. This awakened these farmers. They said: "Increasing production not only does not increase burdens, but also receives rewards. We must work hard." Now 85% of the population in our village has been organized. There are 76 mutual aid teams participating in this year's patriotic high-yield competition, accounting for more than 70% of the mutual aid teams in the village. These teams generally plan to increase production by 20% to 30%, of which 100 mu of rice requires achieving the highest yield. Our mutual aid team has been upgraded to an agricultural production cooperative this year. The whole cooperative has more than 348 mu of paddy fields. This year, it is planned to produce an average of 750 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 32% compared with last year; of which 8.5 mu will be used as the highest yield land, and it is planned to produce 1,200 to 1,500 jin per mu. Everyone is working hard, and we believe that we will definitely be able to complete the high-yield plan.

Model Corn Producer Zhang Mingliang Mutual Aid Team

Putting All the Bonuses Into Production

Editor Comrades: In the old and new societies, although farmers work in the fields in the same way, they live completely different lives. In the year when I was fifteen years old, there was a drought, and my father starved to death. My mother took our three brothers to beg from door to door, and we almost starved to death. Later, my twelve-year-old brother and I went to work as farmhands for the landlord for eighteen years, suffering all kinds of animal-like treatment. In 1949, our hometown was liberated. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, how could the poor have turned over! Later, I gloriously joined the Communist Party and worked hard in production. Last year, Elder Brother Li Shunda proposed a patriotic production increase competition. I organized production with the masses in the village, proposed a challenge, and launched seasonal agricultural competitions to farmers in various places in each agricultural season. Last year, our corn harvest was the best. The average yield of three mu of corn was 750 jin per mu, and we received a reward from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. The success of this achievement is first due to the leadership and help of the Party and the government. County Chief Zhang Qingshan often came to talk to us, asked us what difficulties we had, explained the principles of patriotism, and also sent agricultural technical cadres to guide us specifically. Second, we listened to Chairman Mao's words, insisted on organizing production, solved the difficulties of working alone, and were able to achieve careful cultivation. This time, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government awarded us 2 million yuan in RMB and a medal. Our whole team agreed to use the bonus to purchase fertilizers, agricultural tools and other means of production in order to increase production even more. This award is a great encouragement to us and to the farmer brothers in the whole county. On the day of the award, there were more than 1,800 mutual aid team leaders and more than 400 high-yield households participating in the county, as well as representatives from other villages and more than 100 individual farmers. They all expressed their willingness to participate in the patriotic production increase movement on the spot. An old man from another county who had rushed from more than forty li away, who was already in his sixties, warmly held my hand, kept touching the medal I was wearing, and was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He said: "So you are Zhang Mingliang! Our farmers never thought that we would have today. Don't look at me being old, I will also organize mutual aid and also compete when I go back."

Model Cotton Producer Liang Jiarui

Leading the Whole Village to Improve Technology and Increase Cotton Production

Editor Comrades: After the news that I received the high-yield award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government spread to the village, the masses in the whole village specially held a celebration meeting for me. But I know that this is not my personal glory, but the glory of the Party.

In the old society, in addition to farming, I was also an old-fashioned doctor, but even so, I couldn't get enough to eat and wear. In 1947, Shijiazhuang was liberated, and I was allocated nine mu of land, and I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Under the cultivation and education of the Party for four years, my political consciousness has been improved, I have established the idea of ​​serving the people, and I have learned cotton planting technology. In 1950, with the help of the People's Government and farm technical experts, my cotton yield reached 480 jin per mu, and the village averaged 280 jin per mu. This improved the production confidence of the masses. Everyone supported me and elected me as the village chief. At that time, I was determined to do a good job for everyone and increase production together. In 1951, I formed a production technology research group with experienced cotton farmers in the village, and spread my own cotton planting experience and the Soviet cotton planting experience I knew to the farmers in the whole village. This year, my cotton yield reached 745 jin per mu, and the village averaged 380 jin per mu. Our village's cotton has had a good harvest for two consecutive years, and my yield has created the highest record in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City for two years. This is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao!

I also have two shortcomings: one is that I have not organized all the masses in the village, and I promise to overcome this shortcoming with practical actions this year. Another shortcoming is that the cotton seedlings are sparse. I must learn from the Soviet Union's experience of deep plowing, close planting, and more fertilizer this year, and strive for a greater harvest.

    读者来信
    各地丰产模范来信
    编者按：今年三月十六日中央人民政府农业部发布命令，奖励各地在一九五一年农业爱国丰产运动中创造丰产新纪录的许多丰产村、丰产农业生产合作社、丰产互助组和丰产模范农民，第一批得奖者的名单公布以后，本报陆续接到四十多封受奖者的来信。他们一致表示，这个光荣首先应该属于毛主席、共产党和全体劳动人民，因为这是使他们能够创造丰产纪录的前提。他们认为这种奖励的教育意义很大，它对各地农民组织起来，提高产量，都起了鼓舞和推动作用。他们表示今后要团结群众，更加努力生产，创造更高的丰产纪录。现在我们从这四十多封来信中，挑选了六封信发表在下面：
    谷子丰产模范张图书
    热爱新社会创出丰产纪录
    编辑同志：俺是个老庄稼汉，今年已五十八岁，想不到还会得到中央人民政府的奖励。这份光荣要是俺妻能见到，不知会怎样欢喜；可是她早在十三年前和俺的第四个儿子一起饿死了。那年俺家有七口人，种着六亩地，收成不坏。但汉奸军队把俺家全部粮食都拿走了，还打死了俺第二个儿子。俺们都饿得像纸糊的似的。俺妻和四儿饿死后，俺把一个男孩给了人，剩下的三人就出外逃荒去了。提起这些往事，真使俺心酸鼻酸。俺和旧社会有切身仇恨，俺就对新社会特别感到好。一九四六年俺村解放，为了保卫全村，俺就当了自卫队班长，俺儿当了武装部长。一九四八年村里实行土地改革，俺家又分得四亩地，连原有的六亩地，共有十亩地了。俺全家努力生产，十亩地年年丰收，有吃有穿，还不受气。去年俺组织了互助组，单干不能解决的问题都解决了，还能抽时间专门研究生产技术。这样，俺种的一亩一分谷子收了一千一百二十四斤。俺很明白，要是没有人民政府和各方面的帮助，这个丰产和这份光荣都是得不到的。俺今后不但要搞好互助组，而且还要搞好全村的生产。现在全村有五十一个互助组，已有四十个订立了丰产计划。俺还计划经常到县里农场去学习先进技术，还要和各村交流不同季节的各种庄稼的丰产经验。

    谷子丰产模范池万库
    决心领导全村群众积极生产
    编辑同志：我今年已经六十七岁了。我在旧社会里受尽了苦。我十五岁时给地主当小长工，有吃无穿，每天受气。十七岁时我去学皮匠手艺，整整九年，只做些杂务，啥也没有学成。二十六岁时，我又开始给地主赶大车，一直赶了十八年。以后我就靠租种土地，糊里糊涂地过那穷光景。那时谁把庄稼人当个人看哩！
    一九四八年，我们这地方解放了，庄稼人才抬起头站起身来。我虽然上了年岁，但脑筋不老。去年我们这里受了旱灾，我听了人民政府的话，精耕细作，担水抗旱。结果不但战胜了旱灾，而且还获得了丰产。中央人民政府农业部和省县人民政府都奖励我，使我高兴的不知该说什么才好。我现在决心要在生产战线上更加努力。去冬我参加省的劳动模范会回来，明白了组织起来的好处，自己先组织起了一个拨工互助组，这就带动了村中一百七十五户人家都参加了拨工互助组（全村共二百十五户人家）。现在全村共有三十八个组。全村群众生产情绪都非常高涨，提出今年要争取做丰产村。
    在县的扩大生产会议上，我省杨耕田主席号召全县群众向我学习。这几天有的村寄来应战书，有的村来信问丰产经验，还有的亲自来我家研究生产技术。各村群众对我的希望很大，但我感觉自己差得太远。我要尽我最大的力量，除了和全村群众搞好丰产运动外，还要抽时间去帮助别村，也把生产搞好。我们一定要多打粮食，支持抗美援朝的最后胜利！

    玉米丰产模范韩六孩
    帮助群众克服保守思想
    编辑同志：四月二十八日，我们县里开了授奖大会，刘县长代表人民政府亲自给我发了奖，各机关团体给我送了好多喜报和贺辞，小学生给我献了花。我真喜欢得说不出话来。我这个雇工出身的庄稼汉，能够得到今天的光荣，是因为毛主席、共产党领导人民革命，又领导人民努力生产的缘故，所以我觉得光荣应属于毛主席、共产党和全体劳动人民。在授奖大会上，我向到会的近一千个互助组的代表，报告了玉米丰产经验。代表们认识了“生产到顶”的思想是错误的。如代表李宗怀说：“我原来觉得咱这地方自古以来每亩玉茭收到六、七百斤是最多的了，今天听了韩六孩的丰产经验，打破了我的保守思想，他今年还计划要收一千二百斤，我可得向他学习，也争取全组今年丰收。”王金铭说：“我相信我们还没有尽量发挥土地的潜在力，只要组织起来提高技术，每亩地生产更多粮食是做得到的，我们要学习丰产经验，做到全面丰产。”当场，劳动模范范进德代表一区四百五十二个互助组对我向全省提出的爱国丰产竞赛联名应战，他们保证全区今年要出现七十九个丰产组、六百二十五个丰产户，要在五千九百零九亩的土地上，创造高额丰产纪录。其他二区、三区的代表也都表示向我应战。
    我虽得了玉米丰产模范的称号，但我决不能自满，还要继续研究，提高技术，打更多的玉米。现在我的互助组又扩大了五户，大家民主讨论，开展了生产检查运动，一定要达到丰产。

    水稻丰产模范李有安
    使农民消除了增产的顾虑
    编辑同志：去年我们村有些农民兄弟还拿旧社会的眼光来看新社会，明明增产了，却不敢实报，怕多报了会多负担。事实上，我的地丰产了不但没有多负担，而且还得到了中央人民政府农业部的奖励。这就使这些农民醒悟了。他们说：“增产不但不多负担，还受到奖励，我们可要下劲干了。”现在我们村已有百分之八十五的人口组织起来了。参加今年爱国丰产竞赛的互助组有七十六个，占全村互助组百分之七十以上。这些组普遍计划增产二成到三成，其中有一百亩水稻要求达到最高产量。我们的互助组今年已提高为农业生产合作社。全社有水田三百四十八亩多，今年计划每亩平均产七百五十斤水稻，比去年增产三成二；其中八亩半作为最高产量地，计划每亩产一千二百到一千五百斤。我们大家正在加紧努力，相信一定能完成丰产计划。

    玉米丰产模范张明亮互助组
    把全部奖金投入生产
    编辑同志：在新旧两个社会里，庄稼人虽然一样下地干活，可是过的是完全不同的生活。我十五岁那年天旱，我父亲活活饿死，母亲带我们兄弟三人沿门讨吃，也差一点饿死。后来我和十二岁的弟弟去给地主当长工，一当十八年，受尽了畜生般的待遇。一九四九年我们家乡解放了。没有毛主席和共产党，那有这穷人翻身的日子啊！后来我光荣地加入了共产党，努力生产。去年李顺达老大哥提出了爱国增产竞赛，我就和村里群众组织起来生产，提出应战，并且在各个农事季节向各地农民兄弟提出季节性的农事竞赛。去年我们的玉米收成最好，三亩玉米平均每亩产七百五十市斤，得到中央农业部的奖励。这个成绩的得来，第一是党和政府的领导和帮助。县长张青山同志经常来和我们谈话，问我们有啥困难，又讲解爱国道理，他还派了农业技术干部专门来指导我们。第二是我们听毛主席的话，坚持组织起来生产，解决了单干的困难，能够做到精耕细作。这次中央农业部奖给我们二百万元人民币，奖章一枚，我们全组都同意把奖金购买肥料、农具等生产资料，以便更多增产。这次奖励，对我们、对全县农民兄弟都是很大的鼓舞。那天领奖时，全县有一千八百多个互助组长和四百多个丰产户参加，还有其他村代表、单干农民等一百多人。他们都当场表示要参加爱国增产运动。从四十多里外赶来的一个别县的老乡，已经六十多岁了，他热情地拉我的手，不住地摸我身上挂的奖章，喜得合不拢嘴，他说：“你就是张明亮啊！咱庄稼人想不到也有今天，别看我年老，回去也要组织互助，也要竞赛。”

    棉花丰产模范梁家瑞
    带动全村改进技术增产棉花
    编辑同志：我得到中央农业部丰产奖的消息传到村里后，全村群众特地为我开了个庆祝会。可是我知道，这不是我个人的光荣，而是党的光荣。
    在旧社会里，我除了种地外，我还是旧式医生，就那样我也得不到温饱。一九四七年石家庄解放，我分得了九亩地，并光荣地加入了中国共产党。四年来在党的培养教育下，我的政治觉悟提高了，树立了为人民服务的思想，学会了植棉技术。一九五○年在人民政府和农场技术专家的帮助下，我的棉花每亩产到四百八十斤，全村平均每亩摘二百八十斤。这一下可提高了群众的生产信心。大家拥护我，选我当村长，那时我下定决心要好好给大家办事，和大家一道提高产量。一九五一年，我把村里种棉有经验的农民组成生产技术研究组，并把我自己的种棉经验和我知道的苏联植棉经验传播给全村农民。这年我的棉花每亩产到七百四十五斤，全村平均每亩产了三百八十斤。我们村棉花接连二年丰收，我的产量两年都创造了石家庄市郊区的最高纪录，这都是党和毛主席的功劳啊！
    我还有两个缺点：一个是没有把全村群众全部组织起来，今年我保证用实际行动克服这个缺点。还有一个缺点是棉花苗稀，我今年一定要学习苏联深耕、密植、多肥的经验，争取更大丰收。
