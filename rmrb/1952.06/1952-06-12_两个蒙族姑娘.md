Two Mongolian Girls
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

In the state-owned Chahayang Farm in Heilongjiang Province, there are two Mongolian girls, one named Saren and the other Soyolmaa. They are excellent drivers of the nationally renowned Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team—the first women's tractor team in New China. During the spring planting season this year, the two of them, driving their "Nazi" tractors, almost simultaneously set a record of planting 4.63 hectares in one hour. This exceeded the farm's standard for the national patriotic production competition among mechanized farms by more than 13 percent.

The first time I met Saren and Soyolmaa was one evening in April. The drivers had already finished work, but Soyolmaa was still busy planting on the land, which was glowing red in the sunset. The other drivers were maintaining their tractors. Under the "Nazi" tractor marked "No. 7," a tall and strong woman in a light gray uniform was tightening the axle tile with all her might. Her broad, healthy face was flushed red from the exertion. A male comrade—the mechanical technician of the Liang Jun Tractor Team—standing next to the tractor, repeatedly called out to her: "This requires a lot of strength, let me do it." But the woman always cheerfully replied with the same sentence:

"It'll be ready soon, I can do it."

This was Saren. Later, after becoming familiar with Saren and Soyolmaa, I asked Saren why she didn't accept help from others. She said, "Now he knows how to repair and can help me; who will help me when I return to Inner Mongolia?" Soyolmaa also said, "We have to understand everything, and we have to be able to do everything ourselves. Driving, repairing, agricultural knowledge…we have to learn everything. The people of Inner Mongolia sent us here to learn skills and return to build Inner Mongolia's modern agriculture, not to come back still knowing nothing and needing help with everything."

They work for a beautiful ideal. From the first day they arrived at the Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team, they overcame various difficulties with the unique fortitude and boldness of the Mongolian people, immersing themselves in a frenzy of study and labor.

In 1950, when Saren was twenty-one years old, she came to the Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team with seventeen-year-old Soyolmaa. The unfamiliar place and lifestyle presented many difficulties for the two young girls who had just left the Inner Mongolian grasslands. They had a low level of education; although they had studied for three or four years after liberation, they were still "often face to face, but didn't know their names" when it came to difficult Chinese characters. Recalling the difficult situation at the time, the cheerful Soyolmaa naively said, "If it were just for myself, I would have gone back long ago, but thinking that we were sent by all the people of the ethnic group, I gritted my teeth and persevered..." Saren, being older and a member of the Communist Youth League for two years, had also honorably joined the Communist Party three months before coming to the Liang Jun Tractor Team. Although she encountered the same difficulties as Soyolmaa, she never forgot the attitude that a Communist Party member should have in the face of difficulties, and she often encouraged the young Soyolmaa: "We must not fail the expectations of all the people of the ethnic group."

People of all ethnic groups in China living in the Mao Zedong era, no matter where they are, will feel brotherly and sisterly friendship and care as if they were in their own home. Saren and Soyolmaa deeply understand this. Comrade Liang Jun and her female tractor drivers, other students, and agricultural workers all gave them fraternal care and attention. Comrade Liang Jun paid special attention to them, often using her own personal experience to strengthen their confidence: "I'm the same as you two, if I can do it, you can do it too." She also said, "I am the first female tractor driver in New China, and you are the second Liang Jun, the first female tractor drivers in New Inner Mongolia." In order to improve their education and enable them to master the technology as soon as possible, Comrade Liang Jun often taught them word by word until late at night when everyone else was asleep; in actual operations, she gave them more opportunities to practice, allowing them to work boldly while explaining to them carefully. In less than half a year, they learned to drive tractors, and now they can independently operate a machine and perform complex combined operations.

Saren and Soyolmaa are brave and hardworking, and their labor achievements are well-known throughout the team.

This year, Saren's "Nazi" tractor "No. 7" is responsible for the pre-sowing and post-sowing compaction of the team's wheat fields. In northern Manchuria, spring operations are a very tense job. The climate here has very little rainfall in the spring, and almost all of the annual rainfall of around 400 mm is concentrated in the wheat harvest season around August. Planting ten or eight mu of wheat, if there is cloudy and rainy weather, a quick effort will bring in the harvest. With large-scale operations of tens of thousands of mu, if continuous rainy weather prevents the use of mechanical operations, the losses will be great. In order to allow the wheat to mature as soon as possible and prevent the mature wheat from suffering losses during harvest, it is necessary to change the traditional old farming methods and advance the sowing time. Similarly, in order to prevent spring drought and preserve moisture in the soil, it is necessary to implement the scientific farming methods of pre-sowing compaction and post-sowing compaction. Saren knows the importance of her task in sowing operations: "If I can complete the pre-sowing compaction early, I can advance the sowing period." "If I compact well, I can prevent and resist drought." In order to take care of the women's health, the farm leaders do not allow them to work at night, but the first work area of the Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team, which is responsible for cultivation, always has lights flashing and tractors roaring at night.

One day, it was already very dark, but Saren had not returned yet. At first, people didn't pay attention—the female generals of the Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team are all competitive, and no one is willing to stop working until it is so dark that they can't see anything. But it was already 11:00 p.m., and Saren still hadn't returned, so everyone became anxious. The director of the work area ran to the field and shouted Saren's name loudly, but there was no response! After searching for a long time in the fields, they finally found them: it turned out that Saren and her two little assistants were asleep in the field. The director of the work area became angry when he saw them: "Why didn't you go back? What if you get sick from sleeping in the wild?..." After the director of the work area finished venting his anger, Saren admitted her mistake and said, "It's already past midnight, even if we go back now, it will be dawn before we fall asleep, we will change it in the future. Let us rest here for a while today..." The director looked at his watch and saw that dawn was indeed not far away, so he had to sternly say, "If you do this again, you will definitely be punished." And then he went back—in fact, Saren and the others had just stopped the tractor and were planning to rest for a while before continuing to work, but just then they heard the director of the work area calling them, so they pretended to be asleep. As soon as the director of the work area left, they started working again.

What power made Saren forget her fatigue and refuse to return at night? On April 17th—a day of heavy rain and snow—when tractors couldn't go into the fields, I met Saren and Soyolmaa in the farm's technical guidance room and asked them such a question.

"We never know fatigue," Saren and Soyolmaa said, "The past was really called suffering."

The two Mongolian girls told me about their past miserable lives.

Saren's father grazed cattle for the herdsman, and at the same time rented some land from the landlord. Little Saren had to share the burden of family life from the age of seven or eight. When her father went to graze cattle, Saren went to the field to pull weeds; when her father went to hoe the ground, she went to the wilderness to graze. On windy and rainy autumn nights, little Saren, only covered with a piece of torn cloth, was cold and afraid. When she was sixteen years old, she couldn't bear this kind of suffering anymore, so she went to work in a wool weaving factory. During the "puppet Manchukuo" era, working in the enemy's factory was no less bitter than grazing cattle for the landlord... In the old society, the fate of the poor was the same everywhere, one more bitter than the other. When Soyolmaa was ten years old, she was tied to the back of a horse to graze for the landlord...

Liberation brought light and hope to the young Saren and Soyolmaa. Saren immediately returned to Ulanhot City and transferred to a state-owned clothing factory to work. In the people's factory, she first learned what life and freedom were, and what it meant to be a master—she herself was the master of the enterprise. Twelve-year-old Soyolmaa also went to school because her father was allocated land and livestock during the land reform. A new life unfolded before them. Soon Saren became an advanced producer envied by everyone. In 1948, Soyolmaa graduated from elementary school and joined the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, riding a galloping horse and sending the songs of freedom into the tents of the grasslands. Also in this year, Saren became a member of the Communist Youth League.

Under the education and help of the League, Saren made rapid progress, and in 1950 she honorably joined the Communist Party of China. In July of that year, she accepted the task given to her by the Party and came to the Liang Jun Women's Tractor Team with Soyolmaa to learn how to drive a tractor. In the midst of intense study and labor, Soyolmaa also joined the New Democratic Youth League last year—in 1951.

Saren and Soyolmaa also talked about the increasingly beautiful and happy lives of the Mongolian people after liberation. Both of their families were allocated land and livestock during the land reform. Saren said, "We used to farm for the landlords and graze for the herdsmen, but now we farm our own land and graze our own livestock." Soyolmaa is a lively and cheerful little girl, and on her "League Member Registration Form," many of her strengths are followed by such a weakness: "Childish nature, innocent and lively, it's good to say and laugh in bed." At this time, she laughed again: "Don't just say that our parents have turned over, we have turned over even more, if it weren't for liberation, how could we both go to school and learn technology?" Although Saren laughed at her innocent appearance, she agreed with her words and added: "This is why we don't know fatigue, Chairman Mao has given us a new life, and we must make it more beautiful."

I asked them what their future ideals were?

"To be a good tractor driver," they both replied: "To be able to drive, repair, and teach others. To build modern mechanized agriculture on the Inner Mongolian grasslands."

What simple and beautiful ideals.

It has been a long time since I visited Saren and Soyolmaa, and the brave and hardworking faces of the two Mongolian girls increasingly vividly appear in my memory. It seems that the place where I met them was not in the Chahayang Farm in Heilongjiang Province, but on the Inner Mongolian grasslands. There, huge mechanized farms are also being established, and hundreds of thousands of tractors are rolling forward, reclaiming the fertile Inner Mongolian grasslands. At the forefront are these two Mongolian girls: Saren and Soyolmaa—the second Liang Jun in New China, the first female tractor drivers in New Inner Mongolia.

    两个蒙族姑娘
    本报记者  田流
    黑龙江省国营查哈阳农场里，有两个蒙族姑娘。一个叫萨仁，一个叫索耀尔玛。她们是全国闻名的梁军女拖拉机队——新中国第一个女拖拉机队优秀的驾驶手。今年春季播种时，她俩驾驶的“纳齐”拖拉机，差不多同时，创造了一点钟播种四点六三公顷的纪录。超过该场向全国机械农场爱国丰产竞赛的标准百分之十三以上。
    我第一次遇到萨仁和索耀尔玛，是在四月的一个黄昏。那时，驾驶手们已经收工了，索耀尔玛却还在晚霞映红了的土地上紧张播种。其他的驾驶手，正在保养她们的拖拉机。在标着“第七号”的纳齐拖拉机下，一个身穿浅灰色制服，身材高大健壮的女同志，正在用力紧轴瓦。她那宽大健康的脸孔，因用力过猛胀得通红了。一位站在拖拉机旁边的男同志——梁军拖拉机队的机械技师，一再地向她喊：“这是要用大力气的，我来吧。”可是那位女同志，总是用同样的一句话快乐地回答他：
    “就快好啦，我行哪。”
    这就是萨仁。以后同萨仁和索耀尔玛熟识后，我曾问萨仁为什么不肯接受别人的帮助。她说：“现在他会修理，能来帮助我；将来回内蒙后谁来帮助我呢？”索耀尔玛也说：“我们什么都要懂得，都要自己会作。驾驶、修理、农业知识……什么都得学会。内蒙人民派我们来是要我们学好本领，回去建设内蒙现代化农业，不是叫我回去后还是事事不懂，事事要人来帮助。”
    工作为着美丽的理想。她们来到梁军女拖拉机队的第一天起，就以蒙族人民特有的刚毅豪迈的性格，克服着各种困难，沉醉在疯狂般的学习与劳动的激情里。
    一九五○年，萨仁二十一岁的时候，同十七岁的索耀尔玛，一块来到梁军女拖拉机队里。陌生的地方，陌生的生活方式，给两个刚刚走出内蒙草原的年青姑娘很多的困难。她俩文化程度低，虽然解放后读过三、四年书，但对于艰难的方块字，仍然还是“常常见面，不知名姓”。现在回忆起当时的困难情景时，快活的索耀尔玛天真地说：“要是自己来学习的，早就回去了，想到是全族人民派我们来的，就咬住牙坚持着……”萨仁年岁大些，是有两年团龄的青年团员，来梁军拖拉机队前三个月，又光荣地参加了共产党。虽然遇到和索耀尔玛同样的困难，却一时也没有忘记一个共产党员在困难面前的应有态度，她常常鼓励年青的索耀尔玛：“我们决不能辜负全族人民的期望。”
    生活在毛泽东时代的中国各民族，无论在那里，都会像在自己的家中，感到兄妹般的友谊和关怀。这一点，萨仁和索耀尔玛是体会得很深的。梁军同志和她的女拖拉机手们，其他的学员和农业工人们，都给她们手足般的关怀和照顾。梁军同志对她俩更是特别关心，常常用自己的亲身经历坚定她们的信心：“我和你俩一样，我能行，你们也能行。”又说：“我是新中国第一个女拖拉机手，你们就是第二个梁军，新内蒙第一个女拖拉机手。”梁军同志为了提高她俩的文化，使她们早一天掌握技术，常常到人们都已入睡的深夜，还不知疲倦地一个字一个字教她们；在实际作业时，更多地给她们练习的机会，一面让她们大胆地作，一面细心地给她俩讲解。这样不到半年，她俩就学会了驾驶拖拉机，现在都能单独顶一台车，进行复杂的联结作业了。
    萨仁和索耀尔玛勇敢而勤劳，两个人的劳动成绩，在全队都是有名的。
    今年，萨仁驾驶的“第七号”纳齐拖拉机，担负着全队麦田的播前镇压和播后镇压作业。在北满，春季作业是件十分紧张的工作。这里的气候，春天雨量很少，全年四百公厘上下的降雨量，差不多都集中在八月份前后的麦收季节。种个十亩八亩麦子，遇到阴天下雨，突击一下就抢收回来了。上万亩的大面积作业，如遇到连日阴雨不能使用机械作业时，损失就大了。为了使麦子早日成熟，不让成熟的麦子在收获时遭受损失，必须改变传统的旧耕作法，提前播种。同样为着预防春旱，保存地里的水分，又必须实行播前镇压和播后镇压的科学耕作方法。萨仁知道自己的任务在播种作业中的重要性：“我能提前完成播前镇压，就能提前播种期。”“我镇压得好，就能防旱抗旱。”农场领导方面为照顾女同志的身体，是不允许她们夜间作业的，但是梁军女拖拉机队负责耕作的第一作业区，夜间总是灯光闪闪，拖拉机吼声不断。
    一天，已经是大黑了，萨仁还没有回来，起初人们也不在意——梁军女拖拉机队的女将们，一个赛如一个，不到天黑得什么也看不见时，是谁也不肯收工的。但已是夜里十一点钟了，还不见萨仁回来，大家着急了。作业区主任跑到田里，高声呼喊着萨仁的名字，但哪里又有半声回应！在田野里转了好久，才找到她们：原来萨仁和她的两个小助手在野地里睡着了。作业区主任一见就火了：“为什么不回去？睡在野地上冻出病来怎么办？……”等作业区主任一阵脾气发过去后，萨仁知错认错地说：“天已半夜多了，现在就是回去，还没等到睡倒又天亮啦，以后改了就是。今天就让我们在这休息一会吧。……”主任看看表，果然离天明不远了，只得严厉地说：“以后要再这样，一定受处分。”便回去了——其实，萨仁她们刚停车不久，打算略微休息一下就再继续工作，恰在这时候听到作业区主任喊她们，才假装睡觉的样子的。作业区主任刚走，她们又开始作业了。
    什么力量使萨仁忘掉了疲劳，夜晚还不肯归去？四月十七日——一个大雨雪的日子，拖拉机不能下地，在农场技术指导室，我遇到萨仁和索耀尔玛，向她们提出了这样的问题。
    “我们从来就不知道疲劳。”萨仁和索耀尔玛说：“要说苦过去那才叫苦啦。”
    两个蒙族姑娘向我谈起了她们过去的苦难生活。
    萨仁的父亲给牧主放牛，同时租种着地主一点地。小萨仁从七、八岁时，就必须分担着家庭生活的重担了。父亲去放牛，萨仁就到田里去拔草；父亲去锄地，她就到荒草野甸中去牧放。凄风苦雨的秋夜里，只披着一块破布片的小萨仁又冷又怕。到她十六岁的时候，这种苦日子她再也忍受不住了，她到一个毛织工厂里去作工。“伪满”时代，在敌人的工厂里作工，那苦楚并不比给地主放牛少一点。……旧社会里，穷人的命运到处是一样，一个更比一个苦。索耀尔玛十岁的时候，就被拴在马背上，给地主牧放……
    解放，给年青的萨仁和索耀尔玛带来了光明和希望。萨仁立时回到乌兰浩特市，转到一个公营的被服厂里作工。在人民的工厂里，她第一次知道了什么叫人生和自由，什么叫主人——她自己就是企业的主人了。十二岁的索耀尔玛也因父亲分得了土地和牛羊，到小学里读书去了。新的生活在她们面前展开了一片新天地。不久萨仁便成了人人羡慕的先进生产者。一九四八年索耀尔玛小学毕业出来，参加了内蒙文工团，骑着飞驰的骏马，把自由的歌声，送进草原的帐篷里。也在这一年，萨仁成了青年团员。
    在团的教育帮助下，萨仁进步很快，一九五○年又光荣地参加了中国共产党。当年七月，她接受党给她的任务，同索耀尔玛到梁军女拖拉机队来学开拖拉机。在紧张的学习和劳动中，索耀尔玛也在去年——一九五一年参加了新民主主义青年团。
    萨仁和索耀尔玛还谈了许多蒙族人民解放后日益美好的幸福生活。两个人的家庭，都在土地改革中分到了土地和牛马。萨仁说：“原先给地主种地，给牧主放牛，如今种自己的土地，放自己的牛马了。”索耀尔玛是个活泼快活的小姑娘，在她的“团员登记表”上，许多优点的后面写着这样一个缺点：“小孩性质，天真活泼，睡在床上还好说好笑。”这时她又笑起来：“别光说父母翻身了，咱们翻的更大，要不解放，咱俩还能上学学技术？”萨仁虽然看了她那天真无邪的样子笑起来，却同意了她的话，并补充道：“这就是我们不知疲劳的原故，毛主席给了我们新生活，我们就要把它变得更美丽。”
    我问她们将来的理想是什么？
    “作个好拖拉机手。”她俩都这样回答：“会驾驶会修理，还能教给别人。在内蒙草原上也建设现代化的机械农业。”
    多么朴素美丽的理想啊。
    访问萨仁和索耀尔玛后，时间过去好久了，两个蒙族姑娘勇敢勤劳的面影，日益生动地浮现在记忆里。仿佛我遇到她们的地方，不是在黑龙江省查哈阳农场，而是在内蒙草原上。在那里也建立起巨大的机械农场，成千百台的拖拉机，正在滚滚前进，开垦着肥沃的内蒙草原。走在最前列的，就是这两个蒙族姑娘：萨仁和索耀尔玛——新中国第二个梁军，新内蒙第一名女拖拉机手。
