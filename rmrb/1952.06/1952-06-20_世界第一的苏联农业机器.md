    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    The World's Number One Soviet Agricultural Machinery
    The Soviet agricultural machinery exhibition opened in Moscow on the 4th of this month. This exhibition demonstrates the rapid and enormous development of Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing, thereby illustrating the highly mechanized nature of socialist agriculture.
    Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing now ranks first in the world.
    In 1950—near the end of the first post-war Five-Year Plan period—Soviet agriculture received four times the number of tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower each) and tractor-drawn plows, 3.8 times the number of combines, and almost six times the number of tractor-drawn seeders compared to the pre-war year of 1940. Last year alone, Soviet factories manufactured 137,000 tractors, 54,000 grain combines, including 29,000 self-propelled ones, and two million cultivators, seeders, and harvesters.
    The exhibition held in Moscow displayed various types of machines, including more than 80 kinds of agricultural machines currently mass-produced by Soviet industry.
    Soviet tractors are of high quality. The exhibits also included crawler tractors and rotary tractors with various different performances, a very flexible horticultural tractor equipped with a 12-horsepower engine, and a very economical "Stalin-80" model—an 8-horsepower tractor.
    In the Soviet Union, almost all plowing work has been mechanized, using tractor-drawn plows with plowshares. Five-row plows can plow to a depth of 27 centimeters. Three-row plows are very flexible, turning the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters and simultaneously breaking up the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters. Only the Soviet Union manufactures a special plow for cultivating the soil of reclaimed marshy lowlands and peat fields, as well as the soil in orchards and vineyards, plowing to a depth of 75 centimeters.
    Many types of highly productive seeders were also on display. These included: an "SZT-47" grain and pasture drill, capable of simultaneously sowing 47 rows (24 rows of grain seeds and 23 rows of pasture grass), a narrow-row drill, sowing grain seeds twice as densely as usual, which can more fully utilize a certain sowing area. Various types of grain cultivators and industrial crop cultivators were also on display.
    Soviet-made high-performance combines are world-renowned. In 1951, these combines harvested about two-thirds of the grain in collective farms' total grain fields. The "Stalin-6" grain combine can harvest two to three hectares per hour. This combine harvests grain stalks very low, so it can cut off the remaining stalks in the field at the same time. This combine, with a 40-horsepower engine, is equipped with a particularly sophisticated device that can separately collect straw and chaff. Foreign new-style combines cannot do such work. The self-propelled "KS-10" mower, which can mow 40 hectares per day, is also a highly efficient agricultural machine.
    There are also many machines used to cultivate and harvest industrial crops—flax, hemp, sugar beets, cotton, and feed forage. For example: an interesting triple sugar beet combine, which can dig out the beet roots, remove the beet leaves, then discharge the leaves into a large hopper on the machine and discharge the beet roots into another large hopper. A flax combine can harvest up to one hectare per hour, simultaneously tearing off and organizing the flax fibers, bundling the flax stems, and collecting the flax fiber bundles into bags. Also on display were: cotton pickers, self-propelled mowers, and tractor-drawn harrows, equipped with harrows as long as 14.5 meters, which can harrow 80 hectares of land per day.
    Soviet factories also manufacture special machines for afforestation and operating orchards and vineyards. Exhibits included a soil-digging plow, an afforestation machine that completely mechanizes the work of cultivating seedlings and saplings, and a universal machine for vineyards, capable of plowing, tilling, and cultivating.
    The agricultural machinery exhibition also displayed various machines used on livestock farms, as well as various machines used to prevent and control agricultural pests in fields and orchards.

    世界第一的苏联农业机器
    苏联农业机器展览会本月四日在莫斯科开幕。这个展览会显示出苏联农业机器制造业的迅速与巨大的发展，并从而说明了社会主义农业的高度机械化的特点。
    苏联的农业机器制造现在已居世界第一位。
    一九五○年——战后第一个五年计划时期快终了时——苏联农业得到了相当于战前一九四○年四倍的拖拉机（按每部十五匹马力计算）和拖拉机曳引犁，三点八倍的联合机，以及差不多六倍的拖拉机曳引播种机。单说去年苏联工厂就制造了十三万七千部拖拉机、五万四千部谷物联合收割机，其中自动的有二万九千部，两百万部耕耘机、播种机和收割机。
    在莫斯科举行的这次展览会陈列了种种不同式样的机器，其中包括苏联工业目前大规模制造的八十多种农业机器。
    苏联的拖拉机质量很高。展览品之中并且包括：具有各种不同性能的履带拖拉机和轮转拖拉机，装有十二匹马力发动机的一种十分灵便的园艺拖拉机，还有一种十分经济的“斯大林—八十”式——八匹马力的拖拉机。
    在苏联，差不多全部犁田工作都已机械化，用有犁刀的拖拉机曳引犁来进行。五行犁机犁田深度达二十七公分。三行犁机很灵便，翻土深达二十五公分，同时将土壤弄碎深度达十五公分。仅有苏联制造一种特别的犁机，用来耕耘开垦沼泽低地和泥炭田的土壤，以及果树园和葡萄园中的土壤，犁田深度达七十五公分。
    许多式样的具有高度生产力的播种机也陈列在那里。其中包括：一种“SZT—四七”式谷物与牧草条播机，能同时播种四十七行（二十四行谷物种子和二十三行牧草），一种狭行条播机，播种谷物种子比寻常稠密一倍，这就能够更充分地利用一定的播种面积。还有各种式样的谷物耕种机和工业作物耕种机陈列在那里。
    苏联制造的具有高度性能的联合收割机是全世界闻名的。一九五一年这些联合机收割了集体农场全部谷田中约三分之二的谷物。“斯大林—六”式谷物联合收割机每小时能收割二、三公顷。这种联合收割机割谷秆割得很低，这样就可以同时把田中残株切断。这种具有四十匹马力发动机的联合机，装置着一种特别精巧的设备，能分别收集草藁和糠壳。外国的新式联合机都不能做这样的工作。自动的“KS—十”式割草机，每天能割四十公顷，也是效能很高的一种农业机器。
    还有许多机器用来耕种和收割工业作物——亚麻、大麻、甜菜、棉花和饲料牧草。例如：有趣的三重甜菜联合收割机，能把甜菜根掘出来，把菜叶除去，然后把菜叶泻进机器上的一个大斗里去，把菜根泻进另一个大斗里去。有一种亚麻联合收割机，每小时能收割到一公顷，能同时把麻纤维撕下来整理好，把麻茎捆起来，并且能把麻纤维束收集到袋里去。陈列在那里的还有：摘棉机、自动的割草机、拖拉机曳引耙机，备有十四公尺半那么长的耙子，每天能耙田八十公顷。
    苏联工厂并为造林和经营果树园与葡萄园制造出特别的机器。陈列品中包括一种掘土犁机、一种使栽培子生植物与树秧工作完全机械化的造林机、一种供葡萄园用的万能机，能做犁土、碎土和耕作的工作。
    农业机器展览会中还陈列了牲畜饲养场上所用的各种机器，以及为田中和果树园中防除农业害虫用的各种机器。
