Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 28th: On the afternoon of June 28th, at 2:00 PM, the chief liaison officer of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, acting on the instructions of the chief delegate, notified the other party: "Disregarding our firm opposition and the ardent desire of peace-loving people around the world for an early armistice in Korea, your side has once again unilaterally announced a three-day recess and impolitely walked out of the meeting, demonstrating that your side is deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations and prolonging the bloody conflict in Korea. All responsibility lies entirely with your side."

    我方联络官奉命通知对方  拖延谈判责任完全在美方
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日下午二时，朝鲜停战谈判朝中代表团首席联络官奉首席代表之命通知对方：“你方不顾我方的坚决反对和世界爱好和平人民早日达成朝鲜停战的热望，又一次片面宣布休会三天，并无礼走出会场，显示你方蓄意拖延停战谈判，延长朝鲜的流血冲突，一切责任完全在于你方。”
