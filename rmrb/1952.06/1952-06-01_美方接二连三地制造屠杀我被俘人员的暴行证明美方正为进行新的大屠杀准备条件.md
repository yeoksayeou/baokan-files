Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 31st: The bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in massacring our captured personnel are occurring one after another in US prisoner-of-war camps. According to foreign news agencies and radio stations, another 28 of our captured personnel have been brutally murdered by the US side in the POW camps on Geoje Island and in Yeongcheon.

According to a broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, on May 30, another four of our captured personnel were killed and four were wounded on Geoje Island. According to a Geoje Island dispatch from the Associated Press, one of the four wounded captured personnel died of his injuries, bringing the number of those killed by the US side to five.

According to a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast on May 30, five of our captured personnel were killed and fifteen wounded in the Yeongcheon POW camp, where the US side had claimed to be detaining our captured personnel who "refused" repatriation. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on May 30, the massacre occurred between 0:30 AM and 1:00 AM on May 29th. This is another massacre by the US side of our captured personnel who were forcibly transferred to the southern mainland of Korea, following the bloody incident in the Busan POW camp. This bloodbath once again shattered the shameless lies of the US side regarding our captured personnel "refusing repatriation".

Currently, the American aggressors are spreading lies in an attempt to cover up the truth about these massacres. The American executioner Boatner on Geoje Island shamelessly described the massacre on Geoje Island on May 30 as being caused by our captured personnel attacking US guards. Another American executioner, Clark in Tokyo, viciously described the massacre in the Yeongcheon POW camp on May 29 as "infighting" among our captured personnel. But these lies cannot deceive anyone. All these bloody incidents on Geoje Island were deliberately created by the American aggressors, and their purpose is clearly to create conditions for a new massacre of our captured personnel. A spokesman for the executioner Boatner openly declared: "Many more such incidents will occur before a major crackdown." (Associated Press, Geoje Island, May 31). The executioners Boatner and Clark's ability to lie can also be demonstrated by the following incident. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on May 29, Boatner's spokesman described one of our captured personnel who was unjustifiably beaten to death and one who was wounded by US guards on the night of the 29th as having been killed and wounded in a "riot." However, a United Press dispatch from Geoje Island on the same day revealed that an American officer named Taylor, who personally investigated the incident, slapped his superior in the face. According to Taylor's confession, the camp was very quiet that night, and there was no "riot" after the incident. From the ability of American generals to call black white, one can know what their so-called "compliance with the Geneva Convention" and so-called "voluntary repatriation" are all about.

### 美方接二连三地制造屠杀我被俘人员的暴行证明美方正为进行新的大屠杀准备条件

    美方接二连三地制造屠杀我被俘人员的暴行证明美方正为进行新的大屠杀准备条件
    【新华社开城三十一日电】美国侵略者屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行，正在层出不穷地在美方战俘营中发生，据外国通讯社和广播电台透露，在巨济岛和永川的美方战俘营中，又有我方被俘人员二十八人被美方蛮横地加以杀害。
    据澳洲广播电台广播称，五月三十日，在巨济岛上又有我方被俘人员四人被杀，四人受伤。另据美联社巨济岛电称，在负伤的四名我方被俘人员中，又有一名不治身死，因此，被美方杀害的人数已增至五名。
    另据英国广播公司五月三十日广播称，在曾经被美方宣称为拘留“拒绝”遣返的我方被俘人员的永川战俘营中，有我方被俘人员五人被杀，十五人负伤。据美联社汉城五月三十日电透露，屠杀发生在五月二十九日清晨半点钟到一点钟之间。这是美方继釜山战俘营的血腥事件以后，对被强迫迁往朝鲜南部大陆上的我方被俘人员的又一次大屠杀。这次血案再次粉碎了美方所谓我方被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的无耻鬼话。
    目前，美国侵略者正散布谎言，力图掩饰这些屠杀事件的真相。巨济岛美国刽子手波纳竟把五月三十日巨济岛上的屠杀事件无耻地说成是因为我方被俘人员袭击美方守兵。东京另一个美国刽子手克拉克则把五月二十九日永川战俘营的屠杀事件恶毒地说成是我方被俘人员“自相殴打”。可是这些谎言是骗不了谁的。所有巨济岛上的这些流血事件，都是美国侵略者蓄意制造出来的，其目的显然在于准备对我方被俘人员进行新的大屠杀创造条件。刽子手波纳的发言人就曾公然宣称：“在大的弹压行动以前还会发生很多次这样的事件”（美联社巨济岛五月三十一日电）。波纳、克拉克之流的刽子手之善于撒谎，还可以从下面这件事得到证明。据美联社巨济岛五月二十九日电称，波纳的发言人把在二十九日晚上被美方守兵无故打死打伤的我方被俘人员各一人，说成是在“骚乱”中被打死打伤的，但合众社巨济岛同日电透露，亲自调查了这一事件的美国军官泰勒却回敬了他的上司一记嘴巴，据泰勒供认，那天晚上营场里是很安静的，并且在事件发生后也没有“骚乱”。人们从美国将军这种指黑为白的本领，就可以知道他们嘴里的所谓“遵守日内瓦公约”、所谓“自愿遣返”究竟是怎么一回事了。
