Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: The Central People's Government Administration Council issued instructions on June 18 regarding adjustments to several issues in the assignment of university graduates. The instructions pointed out that the assignment of university graduates in the past two years has been basically correct, but there are still some shortcomings and errors. For example, some units one-sidedly emphasized the needs of their own work, leading to some students changing professions who should not have; some units one-sidedly emphasized obeying organizational assignments, neglecting to take care of students' ideological situations, and not doing enough persuasive work; some units did not provide enough care for the actual difficulties of students. In order to properly solve the above problems, the instructions put forward the following opinions:

	(1) In the assignment work, due to the departmentalism of some units, one-sided emphasis on work needs, resulting in a portion of graduates' work not being what they studied or using what they did not study, necessary adjustments should be made. Among them, students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine should be resolutely adjusted, and they should be assigned to work in production departments as much as possible to give play to their due role.

	(2) Those who request a transfer due to illness, weakness, or not being accustomed to the regional climate (mainly students from the South assigned to work in the Northeast and Northwest) should be dealt with according to the specific circumstances. If they can still persist in their work and it does not affect their health, they should be persuaded and educated as much as possible, and given appropriate care in their lives, striving to make them feel at ease in their work. However, if they are too ill to support their work and cannot be taken care of in the region, adjustments should be considered.

	(3) Regarding those who request a transfer due to family difficulties, different situations should be identified and dealt with according to discretion. Those whose families are indeed in difficulty and cannot be taken care of without a transfer should be appropriately adjusted. Some, although having difficulties, whose difficulties have little relation to a job transfer, should be given appropriate subsidies with family grain or welfare funds to appropriately solve their difficulties, and it is not necessary to transfer their work.

	(4) Those who request a transfer due to spousal relations should generally be given appropriate consideration, and adjusted to work in the same place if the impact on work is not significant. If the two parties cannot resolve the adjustment through consultation between regions and departments (two departments not in the same place), they can report to the higher-level personnel department for consideration and resolution.

	(5) Those who are ideologically backward and not at ease in their work should mainly rely on persuasion and education to solve the problem ideologically. Simple, rigid, hasty, and rude methods should not be adopted. If the problem cannot be solved ideologically even after patient education and due criticism, and they are still not at ease in their work and affect the progress of work, their work can be considered for adjustment.

The instructions finally pointed out that in the unified assignment of university graduates, a small number of inappropriate assignments that need to be readjusted should be considered an important task. Doing this work well will improve the enthusiasm of university graduates in their work and lay a smoother foundation for future unified assignment work.

In the future, after the unified assignment of university graduates, if adjustments are needed due to improper assignment (generally about six months after the assignment), the department originally handling the assignment of university graduates will be responsible for the adjustment. The work transfer issues after proper assignment and after adjustment should be handled in the same way as general cadre transfer issues, and the personnel departments at all levels will be responsible for handling them.

    政务院发出关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院于六月十八日发出关于调整高等学校毕业生工作中几个问题的指示。指示指出：两年来高等学校毕业生的分配工作，基本上是正确的，但也还存在着一些缺点和错误；如有些单位片面地强调本单位的工作需要，以致使有些不应改行的学生改了行；有些单位片面的强调服从组织分配，忽视照顾学生的思想情况，说服工作作得不够；有些单位对学生的实际困难照顾不够。为了妥善的解决上述问题，指示提出下列意见：
        （一）对在分配工作中，由于某些单位的本位主义，片面强调工作需要，致使有一部分毕业生的工作，是学非所用，用非所学者，应进行必要的调整；其中属于理、工、农、医各科系的学生，尤应坚决地加以调整，尽可能地调到生产部门去工作，以发挥他们应有的作用。
        （二）由于生病、体弱或地区气候不习惯（主要是南方学生分配在东北、西北工作者）而要求调动工作者，应根据具体情况，分别处理；如本人尚能坚持工作，同时还不致影响身体健康者，应尽量说服教育，并在生活上予以适当照顾，争取其安心工作；但因身体过坏，确难支持工作，且在本地区又无法照顾者，应考虑予以调整。
        （三）关于因家庭困难，要求调动工作者，须鉴别不同情况酌情处理；家庭确有困难非调动工作不能照顾者，应予适当调整；有些虽有困难，但与调动工作关系不大者，应以家属补助粮或福利费酌予补助，适当解决其困难，可不必调动其工作。
        （四）因爱人关系要求调动工作者，一般应予适当照顾，在对工作影响不大的情况下，调整在一地工作；如在地区之间和部门之间（两个部门不在一地者），在调整时因双方经过协商尚不能解决者，可报上级人事部门考虑解决。
        （五）因思想落后不安心工作者，主要应依靠说服教育，求得在思想上解决问题，不应采用简单生硬急躁粗暴等办法；如经过耐心教育与应有批评而仍不能在思想上解决问题，仍不安心工作，且影响工作进行者，可考虑调整其工作。
    指示最后指出：在高等学校毕业生统一分配工作中，少数分配不当需要重行调整，应该认为是一件重要的工作。做好此项工作，会提高高等学校毕业生在工作上的积极性，会为今后的统一分配工作打下更顺利的基础。
    今后高等学校毕业生工作分配之后，如因分配不当需要调整者（时间一般约在分配工作后半年之内），仍由原办理分配高等学校毕业生之部门负责调整。分配得当和已经调整之后的工作调动问题，应与一般干部调动问题同样处理，由各级人事部门负责办理。
