    Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Tokyo: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on April 16 regarding the "Special Criminal Law Bill" formulated by the Yoshida government, calling on the Japanese people to fight to crush this fascist bill.
    The statement pointed out: In order to further complete the task of making Japan a colony of the United States, the Yoshida government has recently formulated the "Special Criminal Law Bill," attempting to send truly patriotic Japanese people to US military courts under the guise of spies and agitators for persecution.
    The statement said: According to this bill, union members in factories accepting military orders who investigate company profits when demanding wage increases, small and medium-sized enterprises manufacturing military supplies who explain the content of their business in negotiations with tax authorities, and farmers whose land has been requisitioned and fishermen who have been banned from fishing who state the actual situation in petitions, etc., will all be charged with espionage. Moreover, even holding a leaflet discussing the above issues will be considered espionage and subject to persecution.
    The statement continued: The content of this bill is not limited to this. As long as a US military judge says "hand over a certain Japanese person," even if Japanese judges or police believe he is a good citizen, they must immediately arrest him and send him away. Once sent, no matter how he is tortured, there is no law or power to protect him. On the other hand, if a person related to the US military commits robbery or murder in public, even if he is arrested by the Japanese police, he must be handed over to the US military. Such unreasonable things would not happen in any country.
    In short, according to this law, the Japanese people cannot interfere with anything the US troops stationed in Japan do. Even complaining behind their backs is not permitted.
    The statement concluded: The Japanese people will never succumb to such a traitorous and repressive decree. The Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the people and fight to crush this vicious law.

    日共号召粉碎吉田政府的法西斯法案
    【新华社十九日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部在四月十六日就吉田政府所制订的“刑事特别法案”发表声明，号召日本人民为粉碎这个法西斯法案而斗争。
    声明指出：吉田政府为了更进一步完成使日本成为美国殖民地的任务，最近又制订了“刑事特别法案”，企图以间谍和煽动者等罪名把真正爱国的日本人民送交美国军事法庭，加以迫害。
    声明说：根据这个法案，凡是接受军方订货的工厂中的工会因为要求提高工资而调查了公司的利润、承制军需品的中小企业在和税务机关谈判中说明了营业的内容、被征用了土地的农民和被禁止捕鱼的渔民在请愿中申述了实际情况等等，都将被科以间谍的罪名。不仅如此，即使手里有一张谈到上述问题的传单，也将被认为是间谍而遭到迫害。
    声明接着说：这个法案的内容还不仅此而已。美国军事法官只要说“把某一日本人交来”，即使日本的法官或警察认为他是善良的国民，也必须立即逮捕送去。一旦送去，就不论他被如何拷问，也没有保护他的法律和权力了。另一方面，和美军有关的人当众犯了抢劫、杀人的罪，即使被日本警察逮捕了，也必须送交美军。这种不讲理的事，任何国家也不会有的。
    总之，根据这个法律，美国驻军不论做什么，日本国民都完全不能过问。即使在背后发牢骚也不许可。
    声明最后说：日本人民决不屈服于这种卖国的镇压法令。日本共产党为粉碎这种恶毒法令，将站在人民的前列进行斗争。
