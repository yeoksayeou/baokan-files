    Saluting the Brave Chinese Patriots
    Soviet Stalin Prize Winner Engineer Guo Valeiov
    All Soviet people are closely watching the heroic struggle of the peace-loving Korean people, aided by the Chinese People's Volunteers, against the American aggressors for two years. Soviet people are convinced that victory in this struggle will be on the side of the Korean and Chinese people.
    The aggressors did not achieve the easy victory they had hoped for, but instead were caught in their own adventurous behavior, exposing themselves as enemies of peace, cruel barbarians, and brazen aggressors in the eyes of all progressive mankind.
    Military failures have deepened the imperialists' hatred and hostility towards the Korean and Chinese people. They have embarked on a path of crimes unprecedented in human history. The use of weapons of mass destruction against peaceful people, germ warfare, and the cowardly persecution of prisoners of war - this is a series of crimes committed by the American and British cannibals. All Soviet people, like other peoples of the world, responded to the brutal crimes of American misanthropes with a powerful protest movement. At numerous mass rallies held throughout our country, Soviet people unanimously demanded that the perpetrators of these shocking crimes be punished, and unanimously praised the selfless heroism of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who bravely repelled the aggressors' attacks.
    I have no doubt that the freedom-loving Chinese people are overcoming all the difficulties on the road to progress, and that through this road, China will become a powerful industrial country, a solid fortress - before which all the conspiracies of American imperialism will appear weak and powerless.
    Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are making great efforts to build a new life and establish a new China. The achievements of the Chinese working people in their peaceful labor are precious to every Soviet citizen. Every victory of the Chinese people on the front of peaceful labor strengthens the power of the People's Republic of China and inspires all peoples to engage in the struggle against the imperialist warmongers and for peace.
    The unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people are a reliable guarantee of world peace and an unshakable obstacle to the new warmongers in realizing their aggressive plans.
    The Soviet experience in socialist construction is an invaluable treasure for all peoples of the world.
    I am happy that the experience of Soviet Stakhanovite workers and production innovators, including my own, can benefit the great Chinese people and help them build a happy life. Communication between Chinese working people and Soviet Stakhanovite workers is still very active. In the letters I receive, Chinese workers ask me questions and tell me about the results they have achieved using our Soviet experience. In this exchange of letters, I see a moving manifestation of the solid friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.
    May the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China continue to grow and consolidate, as this friendship is a powerful factor in consolidating peace in the Far East and the world, and in strengthening the power of the entire democratic and socialist camp.

    向勇敢的中国爱国者致敬
    苏联斯大林奖金获得者工程师  郭瓦廖夫
    全体苏维埃人密切地注视着爱好和平的朝鲜人民在中国人民志愿军的援助下对美国侵略者进行已达两年的英勇斗争。苏维埃人深信，这个斗争中的胜利，将在朝鲜和中国人民这一方面。
    侵略者们没有得到他们所妄想的轻易的胜利，却陷入了自己的冒险行为中，并在全体进步人类面前暴露出自己是和平的敌人、残酷的野蛮人和厚颜无耻的侵略者。
    军事的失败加深了帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国人民的狠恶和敌视。他们已走上了人类历史从未有过的罪行的道路。使用大规模毁灭和平人民的武器，细菌战争，对战俘的胆怯的迫害——这就是美英食人者所做的一连串罪行。全体苏维埃人民，和世界其他各族人民一样，以强有力的抗议运动回答了美国仇视人类的残暴罪行。在我国各地所举行的许多群众大会上，苏维埃人都一致要求惩办这些惊人罪行的祸首，并一致颂扬坚强打退侵略者进攻的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战士们的奋不顾身的英雄主义。
    我毫不怀疑，爱好自由的中国人民正在克服向前进展的道路上的一切困难，经由这条道路，中国将成为强大的工业国家，将成为牢不可破的堡垒——在这个堡垒面前美帝国主义的一切阴谋将显得软弱无力。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党领导下，正在以巨大的努力建设新生活，建立新中国。中国劳动人民在他们的和平劳动中的成就，对于每一个苏维埃公民都是珍贵的。中国人民在和平劳动战线上的每一个胜利，都加强着中华人民共和国的力量，鼓舞着各族人民从事反对帝国主义战争贩子、争取和平的斗争。
    中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的合作，是世界和平的可靠保证，是新的世界战争贩子在实现其侵略计划的路上的不可撼动的阻力。
    苏联的社会主义建设经验，是世界各族人民的无可评价的宝库。
    苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者和生产先进者的经验，其中也包括我的经验，能对伟大的中国人民有所裨益，能帮助中国人民建设幸福的生活，这件事情使我感到幸福。在中国劳动人民和苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者之间，通信往还是很活跃的。在我所接到的那些信中，中国的劳动者向我提出问题并且告诉我他们利用我们苏联的经验所达到的成果。在这种书信的往还中，我看到中苏两国人民的牢固友谊的一个动人的表现。
    愿苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的牢不可破的友谊今后更加增长和巩固起来，这种友谊是巩固远东和世界和平的强有力的因素，是加强全体民主和社会主义阵营的威力的因素。
