My Thoughts on Comrade Le Tianyu's Mistakes
Liang Xi, Minister of Forestry, Central People's Government

I participated in the Chinese Communist Party's Chinese Academy of Sciences branch's criticism meeting regarding Comrade Le Tianyu. During this meeting, everyone exposed many of Comrade Tianyu's mistakes: His task was to unite scientific workers, but the result was that he "made relations worse and worse"; his goal was to promote the Michurin theory, but his approach was "closed-doorism"; his responsibility was to help intellectuals reform, but in his work, he "wooed backward elements"; he was a Party member who had devoted himself to the revolution for nearly thirty years, but his behavior was "disregard for the organization, disregard for the Central Committee." This time, the criticism and education the Party gave him saved him, so there's no need for me to elaborate. What I want to say is another aspect.

The Party pointed out that Le Tianyu committed sectarianism, individual heroism, and failed to unite non-Party intellectuals. This is selfless and impartial criticism. However, the more selfless and impartial the Party is, the more carefully non-Party intellectuals need to examine themselves. Because the problems he committed, most intellectuals, including myself, have committed before, and may still be committing to some extent. You must know that a single "hero" will not cause disputes, a single sect will not cause friction. Disputes and frictions are always caused by both sides, which is what the saying "it takes two to tango" means. Such sectarianism and hero-worship were common in the academic circles of old China and were not surprising, but today, the reason why Comrade Le Tianyu received such serious criticism is because there is a clear and strict Party leadership and strict organization and discipline in education. This is the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, this is the concrete manifestation of the Chinese Communist Party's leniency towards others and strictness towards itself. Can we, non-Party scientific workers, be without discipline and despise the organization? Therefore, the more selfless and impartial the Party is, the more we need to check ourselves at all times.

The Party pointed out that Comrade Le Tianyu would readily criticize biologists with different academic views with slogans such as "reactionary," "idealist," and "serving the bourgeoisie." This is indeed Tianyu's mistake. However, reactionary, idealist, and bourgeois academic theories cannot be exempted from criticism in the new China just because Tianyu was criticized. The new China does not need Morgan, but needs Michurin. However, Michurin's banner is too heavy, and Tianyu "cannot study it well" and his "work attitude is not serious", so he cannot support it alone. This cannot but hope that Chinese biologists will resolutely abandon the old genetics that capitalist countries regard as treasures, and instead learn the new genetics, develop it, promote it, and apply it to agriculture and forestry.

The Party pointed out that Comrade Le Tianyu adopted a passive and slack attitude towards the Party's policy of reforming intellectuals. Here, I don't want to talk about Tianyu, but I want to focus on intellectuals. Because I myself am also one of the non-Party intellectuals. It is already a matter of course and unquestionable that intellectuals must reform their thinking today. The question is whether to wait for others to reform me, or to quickly reform myself? If one is neither active nor willing to be passive, and merely carries the burden of a "scientist", thinking that the Communist Party needs science to build a new China, and cannot do without me; thinking that I can still earn a living even if I leave China, such incorrect ideas, we hope that the scientists of the new China who have been liberated for nearly three years will no longer have. If there are still such people, they are isolating themselves from the people. Because, in this great era, ideological reform has become a mass movement, especially for scientific workers, most of whom can distinguish right from wrong, pursue the truth, and advance bravely. Whoever ignores the masses will be left behind by the masses. Therefore, the question is whether the Chinese people need you. You are Chinese, and if the Chinese people don't need you, you are equivalent to waste.

In short, this criticism and review educated Comrade Le Tianyu and also educated non-Party intellectuals. This is my thought.

    我对于乐天宇同志所犯错误的感想
    中央人民政府林业部部长    梁希
    我参加了中国共产党中国科学院支部对于乐天宇同志的检讨会。在这会上，大家揭发了天宇同志的许多错误：他的任务是团结科学工作者，而结果却是把“关系愈搞愈坏”；他的目标是发扬米丘林学说，而做法却是“关门主义”；他的责任是帮助知识分子改造，而他在工作中却“拉拢落后群众”；他是一个献身革命将近三十年的党员，而行为却是“目无组织，目无中央”。这回，党给予他的批评教育，是挽救了他，不烦我说。我所要说的是另一面。
    党指出：乐天宇犯了宗派主义，个人英雄主义，不能团结党外知识分子。这是大公无私的批评。然而，党越是大公无私，党外知识分子越需要细心地检查自己。因为他所犯的毛病，一般知识分子，连我在内，都犯过了的，而且现在还可能或多或少犯着。要知道，单是一个“英雄”不会发生争执，单是一个宗派不会发生摩擦，争执与摩擦，总是由双方闹出来的，这就是俗话所谓“一个巴掌拍不响”。像这种闹宗派、逞英雄的事情，在旧中国的学术界已是司空见惯，不足为奇，而今天乐天宇同志之所以因此而得到严重的批评，是由于有严明的党在领导，有严格的组织和纪律在教育。这就是中国共产党的伟大，这就是中国共产党责人宽、责己严的具体表现。我们党外科学工作者，难道就可以毫无纪律，藐视组织吗？所以说，党越是大公无私，我们就越需要时刻检查自己。
    党指出：乐天宇同志对学术观点和他不同的生物学家，动辄用“反动”、“唯心”、“为资产阶级服务”等口头禅来批评。这的确是天宇同志的错误。然而反动的、唯心的、为资产阶级服务的学说，却不能因天宇同志受到批评而在新中国可以不受批评。新中国不需要摩尔根，需要米丘林。不过，米丘林这面大纛旗太重了，天宇同志既
    “不能很好的研究”，“工作态度又不严肃”，决不能独力撑持。这不得不希望中国生物学家毅然决然地抛弃资本主义国家奉为至宝的那一套旧遗传学，而改习新的，把它发挥、推广、应用于农林业。
    党指出：乐天宇同志对党的改造知识分子的政策，采取消极怠工态度。这里，我不想说天宇同志，而想专说知识分子。因为我自己也是党外知识分子之一。知识分子必须改造思想，在今天已是天经地义，不成为问题。问题是在等待人家来改造我呢，还是赶快自我改造？如果既不能自动，又不肯被动，徒然背起“科学家”的包袱，以为共产党要建设新中国，就需要科学，就少不了我；以为我离开中国也有饭吃，像这样不正确的思想，我们希望解放了将近三年的新中国科学家不会再有，如果还有，那就是自绝于人民。因为，在这个大时代里，改造思想，已成为群众性的运动，特别是科学工作者，绝大部分都能辨别是非，追求真理，勇猛前进的，谁要是不理会群众，谁就会被群众抛在后面。所以，问题是在于中国人民需要不需要你。你是中国人，中国人民不需要你，你就等于废物。
    总而言之，这次的检讨批评，教育了乐天宇同志，同时教育了党外知识分子，这就是我的感想。
