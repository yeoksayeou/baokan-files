Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th. At the plenary session of the delegations of both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 4th, General Nam Il lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding the bloody atrocities of killing and wounding ten of our captured personnel on June 2nd and June 3rd:
"According to public reports, on June 2nd, your side wounded four of our captured personnel on Geoje Island, and on June 3rd, your side killed one of our captured personnel and wounded five. I lodge a serious protest with your side. Protecting prisoners of war is an obligation that opposing sides should have. These successive murder incidents by your side are clearly intentional provocations, aimed at disrupting the armistice negotiations and expanding the Korean War. Our side absolutely cannot tolerate your side's barbaric and cowardly behavior of constantly massacring our captured personnel. Your side must immediately stop this barbaric and cowardly behavior, immediately give an unequivocal explanation for the continuous massacre incidents, and bear full responsibility for the serious consequences of these incidents."
The other side did not give any explanation for the previous massacre incidents and refused to answer our side's protest on the 4th, completely avoiding the issue. General Nam Il sternly pointed out: Silence cannot help the other side shirk responsibility for the bloody atrocities. Since the other side dares to publicly clamor outside the tent for using maximum force to massacre prisoners of war, why does it cowardly remain silent inside this tent about the bloody incidents it created? Since the other side unscrupulously commits massacre crimes, it must bear the responsibility for the crimes and cannot escape, nor can it escape. General Nam Il again demanded that the other side immediately give an unequivocal explanation for the repeated bloody incidents. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:
"Your side, disregarding our side's repeated protests and warnings, continues to massacre our captured personnel and unarmed prisoners of war, which is already shameful and cowardly behavior. Now, your commander has even further publicly claimed that he will 'use the maximum force and the fewest casualties of the Allied forces' to massacre our captured personnel, which is an intentional and open provocation. Your side's absurd plan to detain prisoners of war is blocking the road to achieving a Korean armistice. Your side's brutal behavior of massacring our captured personnel is obviously aimed at preventing the Korean armistice and expanding the Korean War. Your side is not only murdering prisoners of war; your side is murdering world peace. Your side does not provide explanations for the previous massacre cases, falsely claiming that this is not a matter within this tent. The issue discussed in this tent is precisely the prisoner of war issue, and it is absolutely not allowed for your side to daily talk about the 'humanitarian principles' for prisoners of war in this tent, while wantonly massacring prisoners of war outside the tent. Your side must provide an explanation for the previous massacre incidents. Your side has had sufficient time to investigate the previous incidents of February 18th, March 13th, April 10th, May 15th, May 17th, May 20th, May 29th, May 30th, and so on. I want to ask you, is your side prepared to provide an explanation? When can your side provide an explanation? Or is your side openly refusing to provide an explanation? It must be pointed out that your side is conducting these massacres in order to detain prisoners of war. Your side spent weeks preparing for these massacres, gathering a large force of soldiers, tanks, flamethrowers, and building machine-gun nests in order to unscrupulously commit murder. However, our heroic captured personnel would rather die than submit to your side's violence, and they persist in their just struggle. History will forever record your side's shameful and brutal behavior towards our unarmed captured personnel. History will forever record the heroic and outstanding struggle of our captured personnel in the face of heavily armed murderers. Your continuous massacres of our captured personnel have already eliminated all the excuses fabricated by your side for detaining prisoners of war. For the sake of the Korean armistice, your side must immediately stop all brutal behavior of massacring our captured personnel and withdraw the absurd plan to detain prisoners of war, which fundamentally overturns the 1949 Geneva Convention."

    美方竟在巨济岛继续制造两次血腥屠杀
    南日将军向美方提出严重抗议
    再次要美方对迭次血案作毫不含糊的交代 【新华社开城四日电】四日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，南日将军就六月二日与六月三日对方屠杀我方被俘人员，死伤十人的血腥暴行，向对方提出严重抗议：
    “根据公开的报道，六月二日你方在巨济岛打伤我方被俘人员四名，六月三日你方打死我方被俘人员一名，打伤五名。我向你方提出严重抗议。保护战俘是敌对双方应有的义务。你方这种接二连三的谋杀事件显然是有意挑衅，旨在破坏停战谈判，扩大朝鲜战争。我方绝对不能容忍你方不断屠杀我方被俘人员的野蛮卑怯行为。你方必须立即停止这种野蛮卑怯行为，立即对连续的屠杀事件作毫不含糊的交代，并对这些事件的严重后果负完全的责任。”
    对方对历次屠杀事件不作交代，对四日我方抗议拒不答复，根本避开不谈。南日将军严词指出：沉默绝不能帮助对方推脱血腥暴行的责任，对方既然敢于在帐篷外公开叫嚣使用最大武力屠杀战俘，为什么在这个帐篷内对其一手造成的血案却卑怯地一言不发？对方肆无忌惮地进行屠杀罪行，就必须担负罪行的责任，不得逃避，也逃避不了。南日将军再次要求对方立即对于迭次血案作毫不含糊的交代。南日将军主要发言如下：
  “你方不顾我方一再的抗议和警告，继续屠杀我方被俘人员，屠杀手无寸铁的战俘，这已经是可耻的卑怯行为。现在，你方司令官竟又进一步公然声称要‘使用最大的武力和联军最少的流血’来屠杀我方被俘人员，这更是有意的公开挑衅。你方扣留战俘的荒谬方案，正在堵塞着达成朝鲜停战的道路。你方这种屠杀我方被俘人员的残暴行为，显然更是旨在阻止朝鲜停战，扩大朝鲜战争。你方不仅在谋杀着战俘，你方是在谋杀着世界和平。你方对历次的屠杀案件不作交代，诡称：这不是这一帐篷之内的事。这一帐篷内所讨论的问题正是战俘问题，绝不容许你方在这一帐篷内每天侈谈对战俘的‘人道原则’，而在帐篷外却恣意屠杀战俘，对于历次的屠杀事件你方必须有所交代。你方已有充分的时间对二月十八日、三月十三日、四月十日、五月十五日、五月十七日、五月二十日、五月二十九日、五月三十日等历次事件进行调查。我要问你，你方是否准备交代？你方究竟何时可以交代？还是你方竟公开拒绝交代？必须指出，你方是为了扣留战俘而进行这些屠杀的。你方为了准备这些屠杀，花了数星期的时间，调集了庞大的兵力、坦克、喷火器，构筑了机关枪巢，以便肆无忌惮地进行杀人。但英勇战斗的我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方暴力之下，他们坚持着正义的斗争。历史将永远记录下你方对于手无寸铁的我方被俘人员所进行的可耻的残暴行为。历史将永远记录下我方被俘人员面对着武装到牙齿的谋杀者所进行的英勇卓绝的斗争。你们连续不断的对我方被俘人员的屠杀，已经取消了你方为扣留战俘所捏造出来的一切藉口。为了朝鲜的停战，你方必须立即停止一切屠杀我方被俘人员的残暴行为，撤消根本推翻一九四九年日内瓦公约的扣留战俘的荒谬方案。”
