    Nantong Agricultural School Students
    Help Farmers Select Seeds, Receive Silk Banner
    Comrade Editor: In late May, the wheat ripened. Our agricultural school students were divided into three seed selection teams to help farmers select seeds. The seed selection area of ​​my team was in Xiting District, more than fifty *li* away. We set off on the morning of May 24th. No one fell behind after walking fifty *li*. After arriving in Xiting, although life was hard, our spirits were very high.
    Initially, individual township heads and other cadres in Xiting believed that the harvest had nothing to do with seed selection, and did not pay much attention to this work. Because the wheat was already ripe, we helped them to see the importance of this work, and went into the farmer masses to work. But many farmers did not believe in the effectiveness of seed selection, so we patiently used folk proverbs to persuade them (such as "Good trees bear good peaches, good seeds produce good seedlings, what kind of vine bears what kind of melon," etc.), and also used some exemplary cases to educate them. We worked regardless of the weather. When it was sunny, we mobilized farmers to carry out field selection of wheat heads; when it rained and farmers could not go to the fields, we mobilized them to select the cut wheat heads. We worked against the clock and completed the task in a week.
    In this work, we experienced the benefits of "combining theory with practice". We applied the knowledge learned in the classroom to practice, and also learned a lot of knowledge from the farmer masses that was not available in the classroom.
    We gave full play to the spirit of the "Three No Fears" (no fear of the sun, no fear of falling, no fear of hardship), so the task was completed well. Finally, we were honored to receive a silk banner for being seed selection models. Nantong Agricultural School, Jiangsu Province, Student Zhou Tongli

    南通农业学校学生
    帮助农民选种获得锦旗
    编辑同志：五月下旬，麦子熟了。我们农业学校同学分成三个选种大队，帮助农民选种。我所属的大队的选种地区在五十里以外的西亭区。五月二十四日清晨，我们出发了。走完五十里路，谁也没有掉队。到西亭后，虽然生活较苦，但我们的精神却十分愉快。
    开始，西亭的个别乡长和其他干部认为丰收和选种无关，对这项工作很不重视。因为麦子已熟，我们就一面帮助他们打通思想，一面深入到农民群众中去工作。但是很多农民也不相信选种的功效，我们就耐心地拿民间谚语说服他们（如“好树结好桃，好种出好苗，什么样的藤结什么样的瓜”等），又用一些典范事例教育他们。我们不分晴雨地工作，天晴时动员农民进行田间穗选；雨天时农民不能下地干活，我们就动员他们把割下来的麦子进行穗选。我们抓紧时间工作，一个星期就完成了任务。
    在这次工作中，我们体验到“理论和实际结合”的好处了，我们把课堂中学来的知识运用到实际中去，又从农民群众中学到很多课堂中没有的知识。
    我们充分发挥了三不怕（不怕晒、不怕跌、不怕苦）的精神，所以任务完成较好。最后我们光荣地得到一面选种模范的锦旗。苏北南通农业学校学?    周童里
