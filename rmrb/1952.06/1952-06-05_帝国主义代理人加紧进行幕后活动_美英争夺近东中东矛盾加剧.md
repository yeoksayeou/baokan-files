Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The struggle between US and British imperialists for hegemony in the Near and Middle East is becoming increasingly acute. This has been clearly exposed by a series of behind-the-scenes activities recently carried out in the Near and Middle East by important agents of the US and British ruling groups.

As the United States attempts to exploit the difficulties encountered by Britain in its relations with Egypt and other countries in the Near East, in order to push British forces out of the Near East and seize markets and important strategic raw materials in the Near and Middle East, Britain, unwilling to be outdone, is struggling hard. In March, Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrulla Khan visited the capitals of several Near Eastern countries. Following this, British Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Land Forces, Robertson, visited the capitals of Iraq and Transjordan. In addition, the British government also sent important officials such as Field Marshal Montgomery and the head of the British Middle East Department, Mr. Leith-Ross, to various Near and Middle Eastern countries to conduct behind-the-scenes activities. According to the Italian newspaper "Avanti!", French diplomatic circles believe that the purpose of these British diplomatic trips is to have the governments of Iraq and Transjordan agree in principle to conclude a military pact with Turkey, in order to form a bloc led by Britain as a base for expanding British influence in the Islamic world, and to show the United States that Britain is capable of forming a strategic system in the Near East relying on its own strength. Britain believes that the establishment of such a Near East bloc will enable the US ruling group to refrain from adopting an arrogant attitude on issues such as appointing the commander-in-chief of the planned "Middle East Command" and the naval commander-in-chief of the US-British aggressive group in the Eastern Mediterranean.

At the same time, the United States is also actively engaged in the Near and Middle East. Immediately after Zafrulla Khan, the United States sent Franco's Spanish Foreign Minister, Attajo, to lead a special envoy to the Near East countries to "visit", to win over Arab countries to join the US-led aggressive bloc; after Montgomery's visit to Turkey, the US government hurriedly sent its Admiral Carney to Turkey; Robertson had just finished his "visit" to Transjordan and Iraq when US Assistant Secretary of State for Near East, South Asia and Africa Affairs, Byroade, immediately rushed to "tour" the Arab countries. According to the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Sarha," Byroade's visit to the Near East countries, in addition to the task of piecing together an aggressive Mediterranean bloc, is also related to the effort to eliminate British influence in the Near East. According to another report in the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Amar," the United States is drafting a broad plan to weaken British influence in the Near East countries. The newspaper claimed that the United States intends to support Egypt's demand for the withdrawal of British troops, then sign a military alliance with Egypt, and further conclude similar alliances with various Arab countries.

Britain is clearly very dissatisfied with these US conspiracies and is actively seeking countermeasures. The British Foreign Office has issued a statement saying that British Foreign Secretary Eden has decided to convene a special meeting of British diplomatic representatives in the Middle East in London next month. According to the diplomatic commentator of the London "Daily Worker": "The British and French governments stated that the US conspiracies in the Middle East have caused serious difficulties for the British and French governments, and therefore they demand the cessation of such activities."

Although contradictions have always existed between US and British imperialism in their struggle for hegemony in the Near and Middle East, and this contradiction is becoming increasingly acute, their goal of continuing to enslave the people of the Near and Middle East is completely the same. The people of the Near and Middle Eastern countries see this very clearly. The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Sarha" aptly commented on the recent continuous visits of agents of the US and British governments to the Near and Middle East, saying that the task of all these visits is to "turn our countries into a springboard for another armed aggression."

### 帝国主义代理人加紧进行幕后活动  美英争夺近东中东矛盾加剧

    帝国主义代理人加紧进行幕后活动
    美英争夺近东中东矛盾加剧
    【新华社三十日讯】美英帝国主义者争夺近中东霸权的斗争正在日益尖锐化。这已经由美、英统治集团的重要代理人物最近在近中东所进行的一连串幕后活动明显地暴露了出来。
    由于美国企图利用英国在对埃及和近东其他各国关系方面所遭遇的困难，把英国势力从近东排挤出去，夺取近中东的市场和重要的战略原料，不甘示弱的英国正在竭力挣扎。三月间，巴基斯坦外交部长查弗鲁拉汗访问了近东若干国家的首都。接着，英国驻中东陆军总司令罗伯逊又访问了伊拉克和外约旦的首都。此外，英国政府还派遣了陆军元帅蒙哥马利、英国中东司司长雷普等重要官员到近中东各国去进行幕后活动。据意大利“前进报”报道，法国外交界人士认为，英国通过这些外交旅行所要达到的目的，是要伊拉克和外约旦两国政府在原则上同意与土耳其缔结一种军事公约，以便组成以英国为盟主的集团，作为在回教世界中扩张英国势力的一个基地，并且向美国表示：英国能够依靠自己的力量在近东形成一个战略体系。英国认为，成立了这么一个近东集团，就能够使美国统治集团在例如任命策划中的“中东司令部”总司令以及地中海东部美英侵略集团海军总司令这类问题上不敢采取横骄的态度。
    与此同时，美国也在近中东进行积极活动。紧接在查弗鲁拉汗的后面，美国就派了佛朗哥西班牙的外交部长阿塔霍率领特使团到近东各国去“访问”，拉拢阿拉伯国家加入以美国为首的侵略集团；在蒙哥马利访问土耳其之后，美国政府也赶忙派遣其海军上将卡涅到土耳其去；罗伯逊在外约旦和伊拉克“访问”刚刚完毕，美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿拜娄德立刻就赶去“周游”阿拉伯各国。据黎巴嫩“阿尔·萨尔哈报”指出：拜娄德的访问近东国家，除了负有拼凑侵略性的地中海集团的任务以外，与竭力排除英国在近东的势力一事也有关系。另据黎巴嫩“阿尔·阿马尔报”报道：美国正在拟订一项广泛的计划，以便削弱英国在近东各国的势力。该报称：美国打算支持埃及要求英军撤退，然后与埃及签订军事盟约，并进一步与各阿拉伯国家都缔结类似的盟约。
    英国对于美国的这些阴谋活动显然大为不满，并积极谋求对策。英国外交部已发表声明说，英国外相艾登决定下月在伦敦召开英国驻中东各国外交代表的特别会议。据伦敦“工人日报”的外交评论员说：“英、法政府申明：美国在中东的阴谋给英、法政府造成严重的困难，因此它们要求中止这种活动。”
    美、英帝国主义在争夺近中东霸权上虽然一直存在着矛盾，而且这个矛盾正在日趋尖锐化，但是它们继续奴役近中东人民的目标却是完全相同的，对于这一点，近中东国家的人民看得很清楚。黎巴嫩“阿尔·萨尔哈报”对于美英两国政府的代理人最近不断访问近中东一事，很恰当地加以评述称：这一切访问的任务，就是要“把我们这些国家变成一个跳板，来进行又一次武装侵略”。
