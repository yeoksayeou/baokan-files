    Massively Mobilize Rural Women to Participate in Cooperative Mutual Aid Organizations, and Continue to Cultivate More Women's High-Yield Models
    Production Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    In March and June of this year, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government rewarded two batches of agricultural high-yield models for 1951, including seven female models: Li Tianying, Leng Yueying, Cui Yuxia, Li Zhuqing, Lan Chenxiang, He Sizhi, and Huang Qingfang. This proves that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the women of New China have broken free from the enslavement and oppression of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social system; have gained complete equality with men in politics, economy, culture, education, and social life; have the right to participate in the construction of the motherland on an equal footing with men, and receive the same attention and the same glorious rewards. These rewarded female high-yield models have pointed out the direction of effort for the broad masses of working women, set up examples for learning, and enabled the broad masses of rural women to actively participate in agricultural production, organize themselves, give play to the collective strength, and enthusiastically devote themselves to the patriotic production increase campaign.

    The women's high-yield models have won such honors mainly because they have displayed a high degree of patriotism and participated in and led labor mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, thus enabling them to give play to the collective strength of the masses, use the collective wisdom of the masses, increase the yield per unit area, and create high-yield records. The successful deeds of the women's high-yield models have proved that organizing mutual aid production is more beneficial to the cause of women's liberation than scattered individual production. First of all, on the basis of mutual aid production, it is easy to implement a reasonable division of labor in a planned way, so that women have full opportunities to take on work that their physical strength can handle, and it is easy to exchange production experience, learn production knowledge, and improve production technology. At the same time, under the conditions of mutual aid labor, it is also easy to use the collective strength to solve the special difficulties of women in production (for example, organizing various childcare mutual aid organizations to solve the difficulties of women in taking care of children in production), and to enable women to have more opportunities to improve their political and cultural level. These facts prove that organizing to participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations can not only fully mobilize women's enthusiasm for production, improve production efficiency, and complete production increase tasks, but also is the only way for rural women to achieve complete liberation.

    We hope that the women's high-yield models will consolidate their existing achievements, not be arrogant or complacent, and continuously improve themselves politically, organizationally, and technically, strive to create higher high-yield records in the 1952 production increase campaign, strive for greater glory, and introduce their advanced experience to the broad masses of peasants, educate and motivate the masses to participate in cooperative mutual aid organizations, and strive to increase production and assist local governments in cultivating more high-yield models.

    We call on the broad masses of rural women to learn from the women's high-yield models and learn from their experience of "organizing" to participate in production and increase yields. Women who have not participated in agricultural production in the past should actively participate in agricultural production, not only participate in auxiliary labor, but also participate in main labor. Women who have not participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations should actively participate in cooperative mutual aid organizations and establish the idea of ​​labor glory and collective labor. Women who have already participated in cooperative mutual aid organizations should give even greater play to the spirit of collective mutual aid, consolidate and improve the original cooperative mutual aid organizations, strive to learn production knowledge and advanced technology, improve labor enthusiasm and labor efficiency; and use the power of collective mutual aid to solve the special difficulties of women and protect the due interests of women. Finally, we hope that all rural working women will unite closely with the broad masses of peasants, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government on increasing production and practicing economy, improve technology, cultivate deeply and meticulously, and prevent and eliminate diseases, insects, drought, floods, and other disasters in a timely manner, and strive to complete the task of increasing the yield per unit area in 1952.

    Women's federations in various regions should take the initiative to cooperate with relevant departments to promote the experience of women's high-yield models in organizing to achieve high yields, mobilize the broad masses of rural women to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and learn from the example of advanced high-yield models. For the high-yield models that have already emerged, we must constantly educate them, raise their awareness, and help them solve specific difficulties, so that their achievements can be increasingly consolidated and gradually improved. It is also necessary to plan and cultivate a large number of new women's high-yield models, and strive for more new women's high-yield models to appear in the national high-yield models in 1952.

    大量动员农村妇女参加合作互助组织，继续培养更多的妇女丰产模范
    中华全国民主妇女联合会生产部
    中央人民政府农业部在今年三月和六月，奖励了两批一九五一年度的农业丰产模范，其中有李田英、冷月英、崔玉霞、李竹青、蓝陈香、何四祗、黄庆芳等七名妇女模范。这证明在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，新中国的妇女已经挣脱了半殖民地半封建社会制度的奴役和压迫；已经在政治上、经济上、文化教育上以及社会生活中获得了和男子完全平等的地位；已经有权利和男子完全平等地参加到祖国的建设事业中，并受到同样的重视，获得同样的光荣的奖励。这些受到奖励的妇女丰产模范，给广大劳动妇女指明了努力的方向，树立了学习的榜样，使广大农村妇女积极参加农业生产，并组织起来，发挥集体的力量，热烈投入爱国增产竞赛运动。
    妇女丰产模范们获得这样的荣誉，主要是由于她们发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，参加和领导了劳动互助组和农业生产合作社，因而能够发挥群众集体力量，运用群众集体智慧，提高单位面积产量，创造丰产纪录。妇女丰产模范们的成功事迹，证明了组织起来互助生产，比分散的个体生产，对妇女解放事业更为有利。首先，在互助生产的基础上，便于有计划地实行合理分工，使妇女完全有机会担任自己的体力所能胜任的工作，并便于交流生产经验，学习生产知识，提高生产技术。同时，在互助劳动的条件下，也便于运用集体的力量，解除妇女在生产中的特殊困难（例如组织各种托儿互助组织，解决妇女在生产中带孩子的困难），并使妇女有更多的机会提高政治文化水平。这些事实证明，组织起来参加农业互助合作组织，不但能够充分地发挥妇女的生产积极性，提高生产效能，完成增产任务，而且是农村妇女走向彻底解放的必由之路。
    我们希望妇女丰产模范们，巩固已有的成绩，不骄傲，不自满，在政治上、组织上、技术上不断地提高自己，争取在一九五二年的增产运动中创造更高的丰产纪录，争取更大的光荣，并向广大农民介绍自己先进的经验，教育和带动群众，参加合作互助组织，努力增产，协助当地政府培养更多的丰产模范。
    我们号召广大的农村妇女群众们，向妇女丰产模范看齐，学习她们“组织起来”，参加生产，提高产量的经验。过去没有参加农业生产的妇女们，要积极地参加农业生产，不仅参加辅助劳动，而且要参加主要劳动。没有参加互助合作组织的妇女们，要积极参加合作互助组织，树立劳动光荣和集体劳动的思想。已经参加合作互助组织的妇女们，要更加发挥集体互助的精神，巩固和提高原有的合作互助组织，努力学习生产知识和先进技术，提高劳动积极性和劳动效率；并运用集体互助的力量，解决妇女特殊困难，保护妇女应得利益。最后，希望全体农村劳动妇女们，紧密地团结起来，和广大农民群众在一起，热烈响应中国共产党和中央人民政府关于增产节约的号召，改进技术，深耕细作，及时防治和消灭病、虫、旱、涝等灾害，为完成一九五二年提高单位面积产量的任务而斗争。
    各地妇女联合会应主动地配合有关部门，推广妇女丰产模范组织起来实现丰产的经验，发动广大农村妇女参加互助合作组织，学习先进丰产模范的榜样。对于已经涌现出来的丰产模范，要经常教育她们，提高她们的觉悟，帮助她们解决具体困难，使她们的成绩能够日益巩固和逐步提高。还要有计划地大量地培养新的妇女丰产模范，争取在一九五二年的全国丰产模范中，出现更多的新的妇女丰产模范。
