The Preferential Treatment Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government

On June 1, 1951, the China People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association issued a "Call to the People of the Whole Country on Promoting Patriotic Pledges, Donating Airplanes and Cannons, and Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Martyrs and Servicemen." This call received a warm response from the people of the whole country. The broad masses of the people regarded doing a good job in preferential treatment work as one of the important tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Great achievements have been made in the work of tilling land on behalf of others in rural areas and organizing the production of families of martyrs and servicemen and introducing employment for families of martyrs and servicemen in cities. Respecting families of martyrs and servicemen and taking care of them in production and life has formed a broad social movement. We must pay attention to the achievements of preferential treatment work over the past year, promote experience, and correct shortcomings in order to implement the call of the China People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association.

Leading the people to implement this call are governments at all levels, democratic parties, and people's organizations. Committees of governments at all levels, administrative conferences, and people's representative conferences at all levels have discussed, studied, deployed, and inspected preferential treatment work. They have also convened representative conferences or symposiums of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and model tillers from the top down at the special district, county (city), district, and township levels to promote this work. According to incomplete statistics from 1951, all counties in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Pingyuan, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Subei, Southern Anhui, and Western Sichuan provinces (or administrative regions) held such meetings, and some counties in Chahar, Guangdong, Fujian, Hubei, Shanxi, Hebei, and Ningxia held such meetings. If we further calculate based on rural districts and townships or urban streets and lanes, the vast majority of areas have held such meetings. Taking the twelve counties of the Chanan Special District of Chahar as an example, 2,961 villages held the above-mentioned meetings around "August 1st" last year, accounting for 83% of the total number of villages in the special district. This greatly increased the patriotic enthusiasm and political enthusiasm of the masses, enabling preferential treatment work to be carried out rapidly.

Constantly carrying out patriotic education, education on loving the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and education on maintaining and carrying forward revolutionary honor for the families of martyrs and servicemen, is an important method to encourage the masses to do a good job in preferential treatment work and promote the active participation of families of martyrs and servicemen in production. These educations have played a huge role. People in various places have incorporated preferential treatment work into their patriotic pledges. In Tangshan and Dingxian Special Districts of Hebei alone, more than 80% of the villages have done so. Regardless of rural or urban areas, the people constantly provide families of martyrs and servicemen with preferential treatment, care, and comfort politically, economically, spiritually, and materially. This is not only reflected in various festivals and conferences but also in various daily tasks. Preferential treatment work has become a regular task. Children's teams across the country launched the "Do One Good Deed for Servicemen's Families Movement" during this year's Spring Festival to help families of martyrs and servicemen solve difficulties in daily life. The reports made by the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea after returning home and the thousands of reports made by the Chinese People's Volunteers Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China across the country further educated the broad masses of the people in patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, and further enhanced the love and respect of the masses for the families of martyrs and servicemen. Many models of preferential treatment for families of martyrs and servicemen and models of families of martyrs and servicemen and revolutionary disabled soldiers who actively participated in production have emerged across the country. According to statistics from the representative conferences of model families of martyrs and servicemen supporting the army in 16 counties (cities) in Liaodong Province, there were 778 model families of martyrs and servicemen and model supporters of the army out of the 2,081 attendees. Yong'an and Ninghua counties in Fujian Province also launched a campaign to evaluate and commend families of martyrs and servicemen, and one district in Ninghua County selected 15 models.

Governments at all levels and the people of the whole country attach great importance to and care about the health, recuperation, medical treatment, and learning conditions of revolutionary disabled soldiers and the wounded and sick personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army. They give them priority in staying in well-equipped hospitals and set up sanatoriums for them in beautiful environments. When the consolation groups, consolation teams, and yangko teams organized by governments at all levels conduct consolations, the leaders personally participate, giving the wounded and sick personnel great comfort and encouragement. The medical staff and workers of all hospitals are working wholeheartedly to help them recover their health as soon as possible. Appropriate resettlement and education are given to disabled soldiers who are discharged from the hospital. With the improvement of people's lives, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government also timely announced the adjustment of the standards of preferential treatment and pension funds in the preferential treatment regulations in January 1952. For young comrades with relatively minor disabilities who are willing to study, special revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools have been established to train them, improve their cultural and policy levels, and continue to serve the people. In May 1952, in order to enable various places to run the education of revolutionary disabled soldiers well, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government allocated a considerable amount of funds for the construction of such schools based on the conditions in various places.

Continuous inspection is an important method to improve preferential treatment work and an effective measure taken by governments at all levels to care about and understand the production and living conditions of families of martyrs and servicemen. From the "June 1st" call last year to the "August 1st" Army Day, a general inspection was carried out across the country, and its scale was unprecedented. For example, Liaodong Province organized 650 inspection teams with a total of 2,600 people to conduct a province-wide inspection. During the Spring Festival this year, various places also carried out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen in accordance with the "Strengthening the Work of Giving Preferential Treatment to the Families of Servicemen and Families of Martyrs" instruction in the seven resolutions on the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea passed by the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, governments at all levels focused on inspecting the use of preferential treatment funds and established necessary systems to maximize the effectiveness of the use of funds and ensure the rapid and reasonable solution of various difficulties of families of martyrs and servicemen.

In preferential treatment work, the Central People's Government and governments at all levels especially attach importance to the restoration of production and improvement of the lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas who have made the greatest contributions to the revolution, have the largest number of people joining the army, have suffered the heaviest losses, and have a glorious history, and are very concerned about their problems of eating, clothing, housing, transportation, medical treatment, reading, trade, and so on. Last year, the Central People's Government sent old revolutionary base area consolation groups to conduct consolations to the people of the old revolutionary base areas across the country and invited representatives of the people of the old revolutionary base areas to participate in the National Day celebrations. In addition to politically improving the social status of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, the government also supports them economically. On January 28, 1952, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions to strengthen the work in the old revolutionary base areas and organized the National Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committee to promote this work. It requires governments at all levels with jurisdiction over old revolutionary base areas to take the restoration of the work in the old revolutionary base areas as one of the key tasks in 1952; and allocate huge amounts of funds as temporary relief and funds for the restoration of production and construction for the people in the old revolutionary base areas, requiring to change the face of the old revolutionary base areas in three to five years. Currently, provinces with established provincial-level old revolutionary base area construction committees include Jiangxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Pingyuan, and the two administrative offices of Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui. Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have also successively convened representative conferences of the people in the old revolutionary base areas in March and April, greatly improving the political enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas and their confidence in the restoration and construction of the old revolutionary base areas.

The "June 1st" call has enabled preferential treatment work in various parts of the country to achieve great results in the past year, but this can only encourage us to continue to move forward, and there should be no complacency. The complacency growing in some areas is incorrect and should be corrected immediately. Because there are still many shortcomings in our work that need to be overcome with greater efforts. Therefore, it is necessary to: build on the basis of the 1951 preferential treatment work, broadly and deeply educate the masses to cherish the army, and improve the political status of revolutionary martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers; do a good job in commending and commemorating martyrs and helping their children enroll in school; actively educate and organize revolutionary martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers to engage in production and establish households; strengthen the work of tilling land on behalf of others, implement the fixed tilling system, and ensure that the output of the tilled land is generally not lower than the output of the masses' land; do a good job in the employment of urban martyrs' families and servicemen's families and improve their lives; and effectively run revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools and rehabilitation centers to consolidate the people's army, strengthen national defense construction, and production construction.

To make these tasks effective at the grassroots level, it is also necessary to do a good job in the clearing of civil affairs funds, improve and establish methods for the distribution of preferential treatment grain and funds, management systems, and budget and final account systems; convene representative conferences of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and revolutionary disabled soldiers and models of preferential treatment work to study methods for further implementing preferential treatment policies, inspect the status of preferential treatment work, exchange experiences, establish models, and strengthen the connection between the government and them. In areas with old revolutionary base areas, representative conferences of the people in the old revolutionary base areas should be convened to discuss and implement the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on strengthening the work in the old revolutionary base areas, so that the production and lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas can be quickly restored.

As we commemorate the first anniversary of the "June 1st" call, preferential treatment work in various places has achieved new victories in the struggle against drought and prevention of drought this spring. Now, facing the time when the people of the whole country are actively carrying out the patriotic production movement and fighting to increase the yield per unit area, let us continue to implement the "June 1st" call and further improve preferential treatment work.

### 继续贯彻“六一”号召，进一步做好优抚工作

    继续贯彻“六一”号召，进一步做好优抚工作
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    一九五一年六月一日，中国人民抗美援朝总会向全国人民发出了“关于推行爱国公约，捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属、军属的号召”。这一号召获得了全国人民的热烈响应。广大人民都把做好优抚工作当做抗美援朝的重要工作之一。农村的代耕工作和城市里组织烈属、军属生产和介绍烈属、军属就业的工作都有了很大的成绩。尊敬烈属、军属和在生产上、生活上照顾烈属、军属，已形成了广泛的社会运动。我们必须重视一年来优抚工作的成绩，推广经验，改正缺点，以贯彻抗美援朝总会的号召。
    领导人民贯彻这个号召的是各级人民政府、各民主党派和各人民团体。各级人民政府的委员会、行政会议以及各级人民代表会都曾讨论、研究、布置和检查优抚工作。并从上而下地召开了专区、县（市）、区、乡的烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人、代耕模范的代表会议或座谈会议来推动这一工作。据
    一九五一年的不完全统计，江西、浙江、平原、辽东、辽西、吉林、松江、黑龙江、热河、苏北、皖南、川西等省（或行署区）的全部县份都召开了这样的会议，察哈尔、广东、福建、湖北、山西、河北、宁夏的部分县份召开了这样的会议。如果再以农村的区、乡或城市的街道、里弄为单位来计算，则绝大部分的地区都召开了这样的会议。以察哈尔察南专区十二个县为例，在去年“八一”前后召开上述会议的有二千九百六十一村，占全专区总村数的百分之八十三。这样就大大提高了群众的爱国热情和政治热情，使优抚工作得以迅速开展。
    不断地进行爱国主义的教育、进行热爱中国人民志愿军、中国人民解放军的教育和对烈属、军属进行保持并发扬革命荣誉的教育，是鼓舞群众做好优抚工作和推动烈属军属积极参加生产的重要方法。这些教育已发生了巨大的作用。各地人民纷纷把优抚工作订入自己的爱国公约。仅河北唐山、定县两个专区，就有百分之八十以上的村庄这样作了。不论农村和城市，人民不断地从政治上、经济上、精神上、物质上给予烈属、军属以优待、照顾和安慰。这不仅表现在各种节日和会议上，而且表现在各种日常工作中。优抚工作成了经常性的工作。全国各地的少年儿童队在今年春节发起了“为军属做好一件事运动”，帮助烈属、军属解决日常生活中的困难。中国人民赴朝慰问团归国后在各地所作的报告，以及中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团在全国各地所作的数千次的报告，使广大人民进一步受到了爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的教育，更加提高了人民群众对于烈属、军属的热爱和尊敬。全国各地涌现了不少优待烈属、军属的模范，和积极参加生产的烈属、军属以及革命残废军人模范。根据辽东省十六个县（市）召开烈属、军属拥军优属模范代表会议的统计，在出席的二千零八十一人中，烈属军属及拥军优属模范有七百七十八人。福建省永安、宁化两县并开展了烈属军属评功评模运动，宁化县一个区便选出模范十五名。
    对于革命残废军人和人民志愿军、人民解放军的伤病人员，各级人民政府和全国人民都是十分重视和关怀他们的健康、休养、医疗和学习状况的。把设备好的医院尽先给他们住，在环境幽美的地方为他们筹设疗养所。各级人民政府所组织的慰问团、慰问组、秧歌队在进行慰问时，首长们都亲自参加，给伤病人员以很大的安慰和鼓励。各医院医务工作者、工作人员，无不尽心竭力为他们早日恢复健康而努力工作。对于伤愈出院的残废军人都给予了适当的安置和教育。随着人民生活的上升，中央人民政府内务部又适时地于一九五二年一月公布了调整优抚条例的优待抚恤粮款的标准。对于残废尚轻、愿意学习的青年同志，又专门筹设了革命残废军人学校以培养他们，使他们提高文化水平和政策水平，继续为人民服务。一九五二年五月，中央人民政府内务部为了使各地办好革命残废军人的教育，根据各地情况又拨出相当数量的款项用于这种学校的建筑。
    不断地进行检查是改进优抚工作的重要方法，也是各级人民政府关怀和了解烈属、军属生产、生活状况所采取的有效措施。自去年“六一”号召到“八一”建军节，全国各地普遍进行了一次检查，其规模之大是空前的。如辽东省曾组织了六百五十个检查组共二千六百人，进行了全省规模的大检查。今年春节时，各地又依照中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议所通过的关于抗美援朝工作的七项决议中的“加强优待军人家属、烈士家属的工作”的指示，开展了拥军优属运动。在伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动中，各级人民政府又着重检查了优抚事业费的使用情况，并订立了必要的制度，以发挥事业费的高度使用效能，保证迅速、合理地解决烈属、军属的各种困难。
    中央人民政府以及各级人民政府在优抚工作上，又特别重视对革命贡献最大、参军人数最多、遭受损失最重、有着光荣历史的老根据地人民的生产的恢复和生活的改善，十分关怀他们的吃饭、穿衣、住房、走路、医病、读书、贸易等问题。去年中央人民政府曾派出老根据地慰问团向全国各老根据地人民进行慰问，邀请各老根据地人民代表参加国庆观礼。政府除从政治上提高老根据地人民的社会地位外，并在经济方面扶持他们。中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年一月二十八日颁发了加强老根据地工作指示，并组织了全国老根据地建设委员会推动这一工作。要求有老根据地辖区的各级人民政府把恢复老根据地的工作作为一九五二年的工作重点之一；并拨出巨额款项作为老根据地人民临时救济和恢复生产建设的资金，要求在三、五年内改变老根据地的面貌。目前已建立省一级老根据地建设委员会的有江西、绥远、察哈尔、平原等省和皖南、皖北两行署。察哈尔、绥远两省又先后在三、四月间召开了老根据地人民代表会议，大大提高了老根据地人民的政治积极性和对恢复、建设老根据地的信心。 “六一”号召曾使一年来的优抚工作在全国各地获得了很大成绩，但这只能勉励我们继续前进，而不能有任何自满。某些地区滋长着的自满情绪是不正确的，应马上纠正。因为在我们工作中还有着不少缺点，需要以更大的努力去克服。因此必须：在一九五一年优抚工作的基础上，广泛、深入地教育群众爱护军队，提高革命烈属、军属及革命残废军人的政治地位；作好褒扬和纪念烈士的工作，帮助其子女入学；积极教育并组织烈属、军属和革命残废军人生产及建立家务；加强代耕工作，贯彻固定代耕制，保证代耕土地的产量一般不低于群众土地的产量；做好城市烈属、军属的就业工作，改善他们的生活；切实办好革命残废军人学校和教养院，以巩固人民军队，加强国防建设和生产建设。
    要使这些工作在基层政权中做出成效，还必须作好民政事业费的清理工作，改进和建立优抚粮款的发放办法、管理制度及预决算制度等；召开烈属、军属和革命残废军人及优抚工作模范的代表会议，研究进一步贯彻优抚政策的办法，检查优抚工作情况，交流经验，树立模范，密切政府和他们的联系。在有老根据地的地区，更应召开老根据地人民代表会议，讨论和实现中央人民政府政务院关于加强老根据地工作的指示，使老根据地人民的生产、生活得以迅速恢复。
    当我们纪念“六一”号召一周年的时候，各地优抚工作又在今春抗旱防旱的斗争中取得了新的胜利。目前面临着全国人民积极开展爱国丰产运动、为提高单位面积产量而斗争的时候，让我们继续贯彻“六一”号召，进一步做好优抚工作吧。
