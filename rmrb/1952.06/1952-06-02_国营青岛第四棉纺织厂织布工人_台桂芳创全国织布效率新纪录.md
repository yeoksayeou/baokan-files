    Tai Gui-fang Sets New National Record for Weaving Efficiency
    Tai Gui-fang, a weaver at the state-owned Qingdao Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, mastered the characteristics of the "1951 Weaving Method" and in April created a new national record of 50 yards of average output per loom in ten hours (twelve-pound fine cloth), with no second-grade cloth. According to the speed of the automatic looms she watches and the number of cloths that should be produced, Tai Gui-fang's production efficiency has now reached 98.2%; downtime (average per machine per day) has been reduced to ten minutes. In January of this year, Tai Gui-fang could only weave 46 yards of cloth per loom in ten hours, and there were many second-grade cloths. When the factory promoted the "1951 Weaving Method" during the "Three-Anti" movement, Tai Gui-fang took the lead in actively learning and using her brain to study the various actions of the new weaving method. As a result, in April, she created this new record. When learning the new weaving method, Tai Gui-fang discovered that the main reason for the frequent yarn breakage in the past was due to large knots or excessive fluff on the warp beam. Therefore, she carefully inspected the warp beam according to the "two-to-one patrol route" method of the new weaving method (that is, checking the cloth surface twice and the warp beam once in a large patrol), and removed any fluff she encountered. This greatly reduced the breakage rate and downtime. During the patrol process, Tai Gui-fang flexibly grasped the patrol rules. Each of her large patrols was six minutes. When a stoppage occurred due to a break, she immediately checked the cloth surface after tying the end. When inspecting the warp beam, she also often paid attention to the cloth surface and all links that might cause downtime. Therefore, she could quickly detect any second-grade cloth, shortening the time for dismantling the cloth and reducing downtime.

    台桂芳创全国织布效率新纪录
    国营青岛第四棉纺织厂织布工人台桂芳，由于掌握了“一九五一织布工作法”的特点，四月份创造了每台布机十小时平均产量（十二磅细布）五十码的全国新纪录，且无一匹次布。按照她所看的自动布机的速度和应出布数来计算，现在，台桂芳的生产效率已达到百分之九十八点二；停车时间（平均每台一天）已减少到十分钟。今年一月间，台桂芳的每台布机十小时只能织布四十六码，而且次布很多。该厂在“三反”运动中推广“一九五一织布工作法”时，台桂芳首先积极学习，开动脑筋钻研新织布法的各种动作，结果在四月间，她就创造了这个新纪录。在学习新织布法时，台桂芳发现过去经纱断头多的主要原因，是由于经轴上结头大或花毛过多。因此，她就按照新织布法的“二比一巡回路线”的方法（即一次大巡回中验两趟布面和一趟经轴），细心地检验经轴，遇到花毛便揪去。这样，就使得断头率和停车率大大减少。在巡回过程中，台桂芳灵活地掌握了巡回的规律。她每次的大巡回是六分钟，遇到因断头停车时，她接完了头立刻就去检验布面。在检验经轴时，她也经常注意布面和可能造成停车的各个环节，因此，发生了次布她能很快地发觉，使拆布的时间缩短，减少了停车时间。    （新华社）
