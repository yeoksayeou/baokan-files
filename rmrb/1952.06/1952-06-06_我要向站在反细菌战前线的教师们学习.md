I Want to Learn From Teachers on the Front Lines of the Anti-Bacterial Warfare

Editor: Professor Liu Zhiying, an entomology expert from Zhejiang University, and Teaching Assistant Li Pingshu, responded to the call of the motherland three months ago and volunteered to go to the Korean front to participate in epidemic prevention and inspection work. Their selfless work spirit and revolutionary optimism have greatly encouraged and educated us. In her first letter, Teaching Assistant Li Pingshu said: "One dark night, on the march, I unfortunately fell and got injured. But I was not discouraged, I was only filled with resentment, and I want to fight the American imperialists to the end. Later, I was quickly transferred to a mountain cave, and the volunteer comrades took care of me like brothers, I was almost moved to tears. This is the first time I have experienced the warmth of a revolutionary family, and it is the first time I have understood what is called comradely class friendship." Soon after, we received her second letter, which said: "My injury has healed. I made a cane out of pine branches and can limp around to do my work. In order to publish the enemy's atrocities to the people of the world as soon as possible, we often work until one or two o'clock in the morning." In the combat environment, they have become even stronger. Professor Liu Zhiying had stomach problems and dysentery when he first arrived in Korea due to travel fatigue, but he recovered soon after careful treatment by the doctor. After he recovered, he immediately started working. In their letters, they also told us an exciting piece of news: "One day, Commander Peng suddenly came to our place. He talked to us for half a day, which moved us greatly." Professor Liu expressed his feelings when he met Commander Peng in his letter. He wrote: "I have no way to describe the excitement in my heart. Every word and deed of Commander Peng moved me very much. At this time, I had forgotten that I was a person over half a century old, I was like a child, my eyes fixed on Commander Peng...." In their letters, they unanimously guaranteed to do their work well and never disappoint the expectations of the people of the motherland.

I should learn from them, the education they have given me is too great. The vast number of students and teachers in our school are deeply moved by their patriotic behavior. We must join hands with the teachers and move forward by leaps and bounds!

   我要向站在反细菌战前线的教师们学习
    编辑同志：我们浙江大学的昆虫学专家柳支英教授和李平淑助教，在三个月前，响应祖国的号召，志愿赴朝鲜前线参加防疫检验工作。他们的忘我的工作精神和革命乐观主义，大大地鼓舞并教育了我们。李平淑助教在第一次来信中说：“一个漆黑的夜里，在行军的道路上，我不幸跌伤了。但是我没有气馁，我只有愤恨，我要与美帝国主义者斗争到底。后来，我很快地被转移到一个山洞中去，志愿军同志们就像亲兄弟般地照料着我，我几乎被感动得流下泪来。这是我第一次体会到革命大家庭的温暖，也是我第一次懂得了什么叫做同志的阶级友爱。”不久以后，我们又接到她第二封来信说：“我的伤已经养好了。我用松树枝做了一根手杖，能够一拐一拐地做工作了。为了尽快地把敌人的暴行公布给全世界人民知道，我们时常工作到深夜一、二点钟。”在战斗的环境里，他们锻炼得更加坚强了。柳支英教授初到朝鲜，由于旅途劳累，曾闹过胃病，得了痢疾，但经过医生的悉心诊治，不久就好了。他病好以后，立刻进行工作。在他们的来信中，还告诉了我们一个令人兴奋的消息：“有一天，突然彭司令员来到了我们这里。他跟我们整整谈了半天，使我们太感动了。”柳教授在信中说出了他会见彭司令员时的心情。他写道：“我没有办法描写我心中兴奋的心情。彭司令员的一言一语，都使我非常感动。这时候，我已经忘记我是一个年逾半百的人了，我像一个小孩子，两只眼睛直盯着彭司令员……。”他们在信中一致保证做好工作决不辜负祖国人民对他们的期望。
    我应该向他们学习，他们所给予我的教育太大了。我校广大的同学和教师，都深深地为他们这一种爱国行为所感动。我们一定要和教师们一道，手挽手地大踏步地前进！
