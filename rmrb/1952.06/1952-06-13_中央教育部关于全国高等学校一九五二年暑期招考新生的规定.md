	(1)	The enrollment quotas for universities, specialized colleges, vocational schools, specialized courses, and training courses that target high school graduates or youths with equivalent qualifications as their enrollment targets shall be reported to the education (cultural and education) departments of the people's governments (military and political committees) of each major administrative region for review and approval based on the national enrollment plan (schools in the North China Region shall report to the Central People's Government Ministry of Education); enrollment methods shall also be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central and regional education departments, and random or forced enrollment is strictly prohibited.

	(2)	In order to facilitate the organization and leadership of the enrollment work of higher education institutions, the central government has established a National Higher Education Enrollment Committee. The education departments of each major administrative region should organize the enrollment committee of the major administrative region under the direct leadership of the respective departments, which shall be composed of the academic affairs directors (or academic affairs directors) of the higher education institutions (or major higher education institutions) in the region and representatives of relevant departments. The enrollment committee shall establish a specialized body to be responsible for handling the enrollment of higher education institutions in the region and contacting the enrollment committees of other regions. All national higher education institutions shall participate in the unified enrollment of each region, except for individual schools approved by the Central Ministry of Education.
	The enrollment work of higher education institutions in the North China Region shall be organized by the National Higher Education Enrollment Committee.

	(3)	This year's enrollment of higher education institutions will be carried out in the following ways:

	A.	Regarding military and government cadres who are already studying in higher education institutions: The education departments of each region shall stipulate the date for filling out application forms at the original tutoring schools and conduct entrance examinations on the subjects tutored. After passing the examination, the enrollment committee of each region shall allocate students to various schools based on the enrollment allocation plan formulated by the National Enrollment Committee and with reference to students' grades and priority of choices.

	B.	Regarding graduating high school students (including students in spring classes who are allowed to graduate early after completing five semesters) and youths with equivalent qualifications, the enrollment committee of each region shall, in conjunction with the cultural and education departments (bureaus) of each province (city), set up examination areas in large and medium-sized cities with concentrated populations during the period uniformly stipulated by the Central Ministry of Education to handle the application work. After the test papers are reviewed and passed by the enrollment committee of each region, students shall be admitted and assigned to various higher education institutions based on the enrollment allocation plan formulated by the National Enrollment Committee and with reference to grades and choices.

	(4)	When enrolling youths with equivalent qualifications as high school graduates, industrial workers, revolutionary cadres, students from ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese students shall be given lenient treatment in admission. The specific measures shall be applied in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the "Regulations on the 1951 Summer Enrollment Examination for New Students in Higher Education Institutions."

	(5)	When youths with equivalent qualifications apply for higher education institutions, if they are incumbent cadres or industrial workers, they must submit a certificate of consent to apply from the relevant agency, military unit, factory, mine, or organization; if they are out-of-school or unemployed youths, in addition to submitting relevant academic certificates sufficient to prove that they have equivalent qualifications, they must also submit a certificate from the people's government at the district level or above in their original place of residence.
	Returned overseas Chinese youths shall apply with a certificate from an overseas Chinese organization.
	Graduates of secondary specialized schools (including technical schools, normal schools, medical schools, and other secondary specialized schools) who have served in production departments or cultural and educational departments for the prescribed number of years (two years or more) and have been introduced with the consent of their original work unit may apply for higher education institutions and enter departments and disciplines that are of the same or similar nature to their original studies.

	(6)	The enrollment dates and examination subjects of higher education institutions shall be separately and uniformly stipulated by the National Enrollment Committee.
	Enrollment at other times outside the stipulated dates is strictly prohibited.

	(7)	Students currently enrolled in higher education institutions (including students on leave of absence) shall not participate in the new student enrollment. If there is any deception, once discovered, in addition to canceling their admission qualifications, the original school shall impose sanctions.

	(8)	In order to implement the planning nature of enrollment, students who have been admitted shall not request to transfer to another college, department (or major), or transfer schools.
