    "Not Much Influence?"
    Liu Zheng
    Many middle school teachers, when talking about the shameless crimes of illegal merchants, are always vehement and righteously indignant. This is correct. However, when you ask them what bourgeois ideas have influenced them, they "smugly" produce all kinds of
    "shields" to parry.
    Some say: "My family has never been tainted by the coppery smell of business; even my distant relatives rarely engage in commerce; as for myself, it goes without saying." The implication is: Since they have never had any relationship with the bourgeoisie, the ideological influence must naturally be very small.
    Some say: "I received assistance from bourgeois families and relatives during my student days, but it was limited to economic relations; as for ideological influence, it wasn't very great."
    Such examples abound. In conclusion, they always believe that bourgeois ideology has "not much influence" on them.
    However, it is these very teachers who always feel "underappreciated" teaching in middle school. When someone mentions that a certain university professor is their old friend, they always feel inferior and admire them endlessly.
    Some, upon hearing leaders talk about how new China lacks teachers, think: "Surely there will be another salary increase!" Or they think: "Things are valued when they are scarce; even if I do a little worse at work in the future, my job is secure."
    There are many, many such examples.
    What exactly is going on here?
    I remember when Su Shi entered Mount Lu, he wrote these lines: "I cannot see the true face of Mount Lu, because I am in the mountain myself." Those teachers who think they are not greatly influenced by bourgeois ideology but are full of bourgeois ideas are precisely "in the mountain themselves," so they cannot clearly recognize themselves.
    I think we should stop "smugly" claiming "not much influence," and instead, leave this mountain and take a different perspective to see our own "true face."

### “影响不大”吗

    “影响不大”吗
    刘铮
    有不少中学教师在谈起不法奸商的无耻罪行的时候，总是声色俱厉，愤慨莫名。这是对的。但是，当你问到他自己到底受到了那些资产阶级思想影响的时候，他们就“怡然自得”地拿出各式各样的
    “挡箭牌”来招架。
    有的说：“我家从祖上就没沾过作买卖的铜臭气；就连我的三亲六戚经商的也很少；至于我自己就更不用说了。”意思是说：既然从来没有与资产阶级发生过关系，思想影响么自然也就很小了。
    有的说：“我在学生时代曾经得到资产阶级家庭、亲友的接济，但也仅仅只限于经济上的关系，至于思想影响，还不很大。”
    凡此种种，不一而足。归结起来，总以为资产阶级思想对自己“影响不大”。
    然而，正是这些教师，他们总觉得在中学教书“屈才”。一提起某某大学教授是自己的老友，总觉得自己寒伧、对他们赞羡不已。
    有的在听了首长讲到新中国怎样缺乏师资的时候就想到：“准是又该增薪了！”或者想：“物以稀为贵，今后工作就是差一些，饭碗也保住了。”
    这样的例子，很多很多。
    这究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    记得苏轼进庐山的时候，写过这样的诗句：“不见庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”那些认为自己受资产阶级思想的影响不大而偏偏又满脑子资产阶级思想的教师，正是“只缘身在此山中”，所以才不能清醒地认识自己。
    我觉得，不要再“怡然自得”地声称“影响不大”了，倒是就此出山，换一个立场，来看一看自己的“真面目”的好。
