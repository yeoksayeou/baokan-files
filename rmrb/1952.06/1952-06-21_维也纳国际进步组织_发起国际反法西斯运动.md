Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 14th: The Secretariat of the "International Federation of Resistance Fighters, Victims of Fascism and Political Prisoners" issued a communique on organizing the "International Week of Anti-Fascist and Anti-War Struggle," stating that in view of the deepening danger of war as a result of the conclusion of the "General Treaty" by the United States, Britain and other countries and German militarists and revanchists, as well as the intensified fascization of public life in the countries of the Atlantic Group, it was decided to launch a large-scale international anti-fascist movement to resolutely combat serious infringements of democratic freedoms and crimes of fascism. The League will organize an International Week of Anti-Fascist and Anti-War Struggle from October 7th to 14th (the traditional memorial day for victims of German fascist rule).

    发起国际反法西斯运动
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十四日讯：“国际抵抗运动参加者及法西斯统治下受害人与政治犯联盟”秘书处发表关于组织“国际反法西斯与反战争斗争周”的公报说：鉴于美英等国和德国军国主义者与报复主义者缔结“一般性条约”的结果而使战争危险加深，以及大西洋集团的国家中公众生活的加紧法西斯化，因此决定发起一个大规模的国际反法西斯运动，以便对严重侵犯民主自由及法西斯主义的罪行进行坚决的斗争。联盟将从十月七日到十四日（德国法西斯统治下受害人的传统的纪念日）组织一个国际反法西斯与反战争斗争周。
