    Self-Criticism for Not Valuing Liu Qingxiang's Invention
    To the Editors: On May 19th, the People's Daily published a letter from model worker Liu Qingxiang, raising concerns about our delay in processing the blueprint for the drum machine he created. After reading that letter, we immediately conducted an investigation. Last November, Mu Chunyang, the head of the Rationalization Proposal Section of this association, discovered Liu Qingxiang's drum machine blueprint while working in Jinan and brought the blueprint back to Beijing for research. The original blueprint was a rough draft and lacked annotations. Comrade Mu Chunyang redrew the blueprint to explain it and collaborated with the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Science and Technology Communications Agency to study it. Later, we were busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign, and this work was delayed and not handled promptly. This fully demonstrates our serious bureaucratic style. The trade union organization does not treat workers' inventions and creations with a serious and responsible attitude; this error is serious. Now, we have made a profound self-criticism of this error and have sent the original draft to the Jinan Municipal Committee of this association, instructing them to work with the relevant administrative departments to study and handle it. We have written a letter of apology to Comrade Liu Qingxiang.

### 对不重视刘庆祥创造的检讨

    对不重视刘庆祥创造的检讨
    编辑同志：五月十九日人民日报刊载了劳动模范刘庆祥的来信，对我们迟迟不处理他创造的卷筒机图纸的事情提出意见。我们看了那封信以后，当即进行检查。去年十一月，本会合理化建议科科长穆春阳到济南工作时，发现刘庆祥创造了卷筒机图纸，就把图纸带回北京研究。原来的图纸是草图，而且缺少注解，穆春阳同志曾另行制图加以解释，并和北京农业机器厂及科学技术通讯社共同加以研究。后来我们忙于“三反”，这个工作就被拖延下去，没有及时处理。这充分表现了我们的严重的官僚主义作风。工会组织不以严肃负责的态度对待工人的发明创造，这种错误是严重的。现在，我们对这种错误已经作了深刻检讨，并把原草图寄给本会济南市委员会，责成他们会同有关行政部门研究处理。我们已给刘庆祥同志写信道歉。
