Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th. In preparation for a new massacre, the American aggressors are ordering their soldiers to open fire and provoke our captured personnel daily without cause, and to murder our captured personnel. According to American news agencies, within 24 hours from the evening of the 2nd to the evening of the 3rd, another one of our captured personnel on Geoje Island was shot dead without cause, and another eight were wounded.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on the 3rd, American guards on Geoje Island on the 3rd "had a heavy machine gun go off." One of our captured personnel in Camp 78 was killed and one was wounded. American guards also opened fire into Camp 604 without cause, wounding four of our captured personnel. Furthermore, according to an AP dispatch, on the evening of the 2nd, two of our captured personnel were shot at the gate of Camp 602; a dispatch from the International News Service from Geoje Island on the 3rd also revealed that on the evening of the 2nd, in one of the three camps, 85, 96 and 92, one of our captured personnel was shot.

Regarding the endless murders by the U.S. side, even an Associated Press dispatch from Geoje Island on the 3rd had to admit: "On Geoje Island, violent incidents are commonplace." While violent incidents by the U.S. side have become "commonplace," preparations by the U.S. side for a new massacre seem to be ready.

According to an Associated Press report, the American executioner Bonner on Geoje Island has issued an ultimatum to our captured personnel detained in Camps 85 and 96, demanding that our captured personnel submit to the U.S. persecution measures. According to a UPI dispatch from Geoje Island on the 4th, Bonner has "ordered the UN forces' tank and infantry commanders to be ready" in order to "take action" when our captured personnel resist U.S. persecution measures.

    美方命令士兵加紧寻衅
    杀伤我被俘人员九人
     【新华社开城四日电】为了准备进行新的大屠杀，美国侵略者正在命令他们的士兵每日无故向我方被俘人员开枪寻衅，并杀害我方被俘人员。据美国通讯社透露，从二日晚到三日晚二十四小时之内，巨济岛上又有我方被俘人员一人被无故打死，另有八人被打伤。
    据美联社巨济岛三日电报道，巨济岛上美方守兵在三日“把一挺重机枪弄走火”。打死七十八号营场我方被俘人员一人，打伤了一人。美方守兵并无故向六零四号营场内开枪，打伤我方被俘人员四人。另据美联社电称，在二日晚间，在第六零二号营场门口，有两名我方被俘人员被枪伤；国际新闻社巨济岛三日电又透露，二日晚间，在第八十五、九十六、九十二号三个营场中的一个营场，有一名我方被俘人员被枪伤。
    对于美方这种层出不穷的谋杀，连美联社巨济岛三日电也不得不承认：“在巨济岛，暴力事件已是司空见惯的了。”在美方的暴力事件已经是“司空见惯”的同时，美方进行新的大屠杀的准备，似乎已经就绪。
    据美联社消息，巨济岛上的美国刽子手波纳已经向被拘留在第八十五、九十六号两营场中的我方被俘人员发出最后通牒，要我方被俘人员向美方的迫害措施屈服。据合众社巨济岛四日电称，波纳已“命令联合国军坦克和步兵指挥官准备就绪”，以便在我方被俘人员抗拒美方迫害措施时“采取行动”。
