    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th: The American aggressors are continuing to disperse our captured personnel detained on Koje Island in order to strengthen their special agent rule over them and continue forced "screening" to achieve their despicable goal of detaining 100,000 of our captured personnel.
    According to reports from the Associated Press and Reuters, our captured personnel are being dispersed to many new camps, "each new camp is surrounded by eight guard towers," and all guard towers have "full fields of fire";
    "A machine gun tower in the center of the camp controls the entire area"; the camp is surrounded by four layers of barbed wire. In the new camp, our captured personnel "are divided into groups of ten, each group living in different barracks. Guards have been ordered to separate prisoners who express a strong desire to be together."
    The purpose of the American aggressors in isolating our captured personnel is to facilitate the continued persecution of them and to continue forced "screening." An Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 11th has already revealed: "According to reliable sources, the Eighth Army is planning to conduct screening again" and is preparing to move the so-called "anti-communist prisoners of war" away from Koje Island. The news also revealed that about 30,000 of the more than 80,000 of our captured personnel on Koje Island are to be moved, and the move will take place after the "dispersion work" is completed. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 12th, the so-called "United Nations Command Inspection Team" has entered the new camp "to check the identity of the prisoners," and anyone can see that this so-called "identity check" is a synonym for forced "screening." The June 2nd issue of "Time" magazine revealed the process by which the US side fabricated its unreasonable plan, saying that the Eighth Army was unable to achieve the goal of "screening", "and finally confusedly came up with a number, saying that there were 59,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who would not 'resist repatriation by violence'," and later added "half-hearted South Korean prisoners" to make 70,000. The news revealed by the Associated Press proves that the executioner Van Fleet is trying to forcibly detain another 30,000 of our captured personnel at all costs and by all bloody means to cover up his shameless lie that only 70,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are willing to be repatriated, which has been exposed.
    According to the US side, since the US side dispersed our captured personnel on the 10th, at least 189 of our captured personnel have been killed or wounded. In order to create an excuse for the new massacre, the US side is spreading rumors that "fierce battles may occur" when our captured personnel in certain camps are to be moved.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th: Although the American aggressors have categorically denied the criminal facts of the massacre and persecution of our captured personnel confessed by Col. Colson, the former head of the US Koje Island POW camp, Colson himself admitted that everything he confessed was true.
    According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th: The statement of Colson released by the US House Armed Services Committee said that his actions "were not only completely justified, but also approved by his superiors." According to a report released by the US Department of Defense, Colson's superior, Brigadier General Roount, instructed Colson to "agree to all reasonable conditions" but "not to admit anything untrue." Colson consulted Roount on the first draft of his reply to our captured personnel and read the second draft to Roount over the phone. As a result, the people of the world know that Colson truthfully confessed the US's inhuman persecution and massacre of our captured personnel under the instruction of "not admitting anything untrue".
    The June 4th issue of the "New York Post" also revealed another atrocity of the US massacre of our captured personnel. According to a special dispatch from Washington by the newspaper's reporter Allen: "The Senate Armed Services Committee withheld the most important news it received about the Koje Island incident." That is, not long before Dodd was detained by our captured personnel, the US side "killed and wounded many prisoners." This further proves that the crimes confessed by Colson are undeniable facts.

### 美方继续分散我被俘人员并阴谋强迫“甄别”  柯尔生再次承认美方虐杀战俘的罪恶事实

    美方继续分散我被俘人员并阴谋强迫“甄别”
    柯尔生再次承认美方虐杀战俘的罪恶事实
    【新华社开城十三日电】美国侵略者正在继续分散被拘留在巨济岛上的我方被俘人员，以便加强对他们的特务统治，并继续进行强迫“甄别”，以达到其扣留我方十万被俘人员的卑鄙目的。
    据合众社和路透社透露，我方被俘人员正在被分散到许多新的营场中去，“每一个新营场的周围建筑了八个岗楼”，所有岗楼都有“充分的射界”；
    “营场中央有一个机枪塔控制着整个地区”；营场周围有四层铁丝网。在新营场中我方被俘人员“被分成十人小组，每一小组住在不同的营房内。看守兵已奉命把那些表示很希望在一起的俘虏分开”。
    美国侵略者隔离我方被俘人员的目的，是为了便于继续对他们进行迫害，并继续进行强迫“甄别”。美联社巨济岛十一日电已经透露：“据可靠消息，第八军正计划重新进行甄别”，并且准备将所谓“反共战俘”迁离巨济岛。这个消息还透露巨济岛上八万多名我方被俘人员中约有三万名要被迁移出去，而迁移则要等到“分散工作”结束以后进行。据美联社巨济岛十二日电透露，所谓“联合国军查验小组”已经进入新的营场“去检查俘虏的身份”，谁都可以看出这种所谓“检查身份”就是强迫“甄别”的代名词。六月二日美国“时代”周刊透露美方制造其无理方案的经过说，第八军由于无法达到“甄别”的目的，“最后糊里糊涂地举出一个数字，说是有五万九千名北朝鲜和中国俘虏，将不‘以暴力拒绝’遣返”，后来又把“三心两意的南朝鲜俘虏”加进去变成七万人。美联社透露的消息，证明刽子手范佛里特正在不惜用一切血腥手段，企图再强迫扣留三万名我方被俘人员，以掩饰他的已经被揭穿了的所谓只有七万名朝中战俘愿意遣返的无耻谎言。
    据美方宣布，从十日美方分散我方被俘人员以来，我方被俘人员死伤至少已有一百八十九人。为了替新的屠杀制造藉口，美方正在扬言说：在要某些营场中的我方被俘人员迁移时，“也许会发生激战”。
    【新华社开城十三日电】尽管美国侵略者矢口否认前美方巨济岛战俘营负责人柯尔生所招供的屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员的罪恶事实，但是柯尔生本人却承认他所供述的都是真实的事情。
    据合众社华盛顿十日电透露：美国众议院军事委员会所公布的柯尔生的声明说，他的行动“不仅完全有理，而且也得到他上级总部的同意”。据美国国防部所公布的报告说：柯尔生的上司荣特准将曾指示柯尔生“同意所有合理的条件”，但“不要承认任何不真实的事情”。柯尔生曾向荣特请示他给我方被俘人员的复信的第一次信稿，并在电话里念给荣特听了第二次信稿。结果便是全世界人民都知道的，柯尔生在“不要承认任何不真实的事情”的指示下，照实供认了美方惨无人道地迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行。
    六月四日的“纽约邮报”还透露了又一桩美方屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行。据该报记者艾伦从华盛顿发来的专电说：“参议院军事委员会扣压了它所接到的关于巨济岛事件的最有重要性的消息。”这就是在杜德被我方被俘人员扣留之前不久，美方“曾杀伤了许多俘虏”。这就进一步证明柯尔生所供认的罪行都是无可置辩的事实。
