Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 29th: On June 25th—the second anniversary of the Korean anti-aggression war—the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, with high morale, repelled multiple small-scale enemy advances. In an area more than ten kilometers northeast of Tieyuan, two companies of the U.S. invading army's 7th Division attacked one of our hilltop positions. Four consecutive assaults were repulsed by our defending troops, resulting in over fifty enemy casualties. At 1:15 PM that day, a squadron of enemy aircraft attacked an area north of Kimhwa. Our anti-aircraft units bravely engaged them. After an hour and a half of fierce aerial combat, we shot down three enemy planes and damaged five.

In the days before June 25th, the U.S. invading army, which had repeatedly suffered severe casualties at the hands of our forces, again drove a regiment of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 9th Division to violently attack three of our hilltop positions north of Tieyuan on June 22nd. The enemy forces were supported by more than thirty tanks and dozens of aircraft, but under the staunch resistance of our defending troops, the enemy was forced to retreat after suffering more than 550 casualties. In addition, our forces also conducted small-scale counterattacks against the enemy northwest of Kimhwa and southeast of Kimseong, inflicting hundreds of casualties on the enemy. On the north bank of the Imjin River, a unit of our army, with artillery support, captured an enemy stronghold on a hill on the night of the 24th, completely annihilating a reinforced platoon of the U.S. invading army defending it, killing or wounding over ninety enemy soldiers.

    朝中部队六月二十五日击退敌军多次进犯
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】在六月二十五日——朝鲜反侵略战争二周年纪念日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军以高昂的斗志，打退了敌军的多次小股进犯。在铁原东北十余公里的地方，美国侵略军第七师的两个连向我一个山头阵地攻击，一连四次冲锋都被我守军击溃，敌军伤亡五十多名。这天下午一时十五分，一队敌机袭击金城以北某地，我防空部队奋起迎击，经过一小时半的对空激战，我击落了三架敌机，击伤了五架敌机。
    在二十五日以前的几天中，屡次遭到我军严重杀伤的美国侵略军，又驱使李承晚伪军第九师的一个团于二十二日猛犯铁原以北我军三个山头阵地，敌军并有三十多辆战车和几十架飞机的配合，但在我守军的坚强阻击下，敌军被杀伤五百五十多名后溃退。此外，我军也曾在金化西北，金城东南等地，向敌军进行小型反击，共杀伤敌军数百名。在临津江北岸，我军某部曾于二十四日夜在大炮的支援下攻占敌军的一个高地，全歼守敌美国侵略军一个加强排，毙伤敌军九十多名。
