The national spring afforestation work basically concluded at the end of April, with some individual regions completing it in early May. According to preliminary statistics, the country afforested a total of 5.02 million mu, completing 48% of the annual afforestation plan. Among these, the Northeast region accounted for 1.26 million mu, the Central South region for 1.8 million mu, and the East China region for 1.4 million mu. This spring, people across the country planted 158.28 million scattered trees, completing 40.4% of the annual plan.

This spring's national afforestation work was carried out in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" campaign and central tasks such as drought resistance, prevention, and spring plowing preparations. The development of the entire work showed the following situations and characteristics:

	I. A movement to eliminate barren mountains and waterlogging/drought disasters and vigorously plant trees and afforest was launched in a planned manner.

This spring, the people of Northeast China built protective forest belts in the western part of the Northeast region. Currently, 26,018 hectares have been afforested, exceeding the original plan by 23%, equivalent to 1.3 times the total area of farmland protective forest belts built in the Northeast region in 1951. In the lower reaches of the Yongding River in Hebei Province, four counties, including Daxing and Gu'an, completed a total length of 1470.47 li of windbreak forest networks in just 14 days, exceeding the original plan by 47%. The spring construction plans for the sand control forests in northern Shaanxi and eastern Henan, the coastal protection forests in Shandong, and the lakeside embankment forests in Hunan have all been completed. Most provinces and regions in East China and Central South China have focused on water source mountain areas to carry out tree planting and afforestation. Water source forests with both conservation and economic value have been widely established in the upper reaches of the Huai River and its tributaries Shi River and Pi River, the Yimeng Mountains in the upper reaches of the Yi River and Shu River in Shandong Province, the Fuchun River and Puyang River in Zhejiang Province, the Gan River in Jiangxi, the Li River and Wei River in Hunan, and the West River in Guangdong. The masses' understanding of afforestation has generally improved, and the benefits of afforestation, especially the benefits of building protective forests, have been accepted by the masses. For example, in the western protective forest belt of the Northeast region, erroneous ideas such as "planting trees loses land," "planting trees belongs to the public," and "planting trees brings no benefit" have been basically reversed. They say, "Ten years of afforestation are better than farming," and "We are the masters of the country, and planting trees is creating wealth for ourselves," so they actively participate in afforestation work. The masses in the lower reaches of the Yongding River enthusiastically responded to the call of the People's Government. They invested in building auxiliary forest belts themselves and proposed that "wherever the main forest belt is built, the auxiliary forest belt will follow." Wang Xiaozhai Village in Anci County, Tianjin Prefecture, had 28 women build a 300-meter-long "Women's Patriotic Forest Belt" and wrote to Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of Hebei Province, guaranteeing to respond to the call of the People's Government to eliminate sandstorms. One hundred and thirty-five women in Cangsang Township, Laiyang County, Shandong, formed an afforestation team and vigorously planted trees and afforested under the slogan "Women unite to fight against the coast." In Shangdu County and Huailai County in Chahar Province, as well as along the banks of the Luo River in Ye County in Pingyuan Province and Dali County in Shaanxi, windbreak forest networks and bank protection forests have begun to be built this spring.

In addition, people in areas with no previous afforestation habits, such as Pinglu County in Chahar Province, Lin County in Pingyuan Province, and Xuyong, Nanxi, and Pingshan Counties in southern Sichuan, have begun afforestation work. The People's Congress of Lin County resolved to green 150,000 mu of barren hills and wasteland in the county within three years, and more than 64,000 mu have been completed this spring. In addition, the masses in Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, enthusiastically promoted the "ten seedlings per person" campaign, and Naxi Village in Jinyun County achieved "afforestation in every household," so that this spring's afforestation work formed a broad mass movement.

	II. The survival rate of afforestation has been generally improved. In 1951, the national average afforestation survival rate was only 65%, which means that at least 35% of the afforested area was lost. In order to improve planting techniques and increase the survival rate of planting, the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government instructed all regions this spring that in addition to completing the afforestation plan, they should also take improving the afforestation survival rate as the main goal. This instruction aroused the attention of various regions. The Northwest region, the Central South region, and provinces such as western Liaoning, Rehe, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Shandong have all issued the same instructions. Farmers in various places have studied the central government's afforestation instructions, and many afforestation teams have responded to the call and proposed guarantees to improve the survival rate. The Northeast region emphasized drought resistance and seedling protection. Most drought-stricken areas were able to soak seedlings in water, plant them while sitting in water (i.e., watering first after digging a pit, then planting trees), or water them after planting. In western Liaoning Province, more than 14,000 hectares were afforested. Those with good conditions were planted while sitting in water, and those with poor conditions were planted using the method of soaking seedlings in water, all of which were done to resist drought and protect seedlings. In the five western counties of Jilin Province, most of the protective forest belts built this spring, in addition to planting by burying dry branches, were planted while sitting in water. On the day of afforestation in Sheli Street, Anguang County, Heilongjiang Province, the entire village dispatched 35 large carts to fetch water. The masses in the western protective forest belt of Northeast China re-tilled and compacted the forests planted last autumn to ensure survival. This is an unprecedented action in large-scale afforestation this spring. In order to consolidate the achievements, the Northeast Forestry Department called on further drought prevention, tending, and strengthening protection and management in the afforestation summary meeting to ensure and improve the survival rate of afforestation. This example provides a new standard for national afforestation work.

	III. The policies of organizing and "whoever plants it, owns it" have been implemented. Organizing and cooperative afforestation have been carried out nationwide. Most areas of the western protective forest belt in the Northeast region, the windbreak forest network in the lower reaches of the Yongding River, and the coastal protection forest areas in Laiyang and Wendeng prefectures in Shandong have all completed this spring's construction plan through public-private cooperation and private cooperation. Cooperative afforestation accounted for 90.6% of the more than 14,000 hectares afforested in western Liaoning Province. Most of the afforestation in Jiangxi Province this spring was public-private cooperation. In Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, just three districts organized 78 forestry production cooperatives, afforesting more than 18,000 mu. Xue Dongfan, a provincial forestry model worker in Kazuo Banner, Rehe Province, planted 250,000 black pine seedlings cultivated by his mutual aid group. Under the leadership of Zhang Junxiang, a provincial forestry labor model in the thirteenth district of Jianping County, five villages, 107 households, and 22 groups were organized to cultivate 8 mu of seedlings, ensuring self-cultivation and self-planting, and planning to complete the greening task of the village in 1954. In various places in the Northeast region, agricultural production mutual aid groups and afforestation mutual aid groups were combined to give play to the cooperative and mutual aid power of labor and tools and improve work efficiency. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation, the policy of "whoever plants it, owns it" was implemented in various places, and the masses were helped to solve the difficulties of seedlings and land. In Xishui County, Hubei, the public provided advances and mobilized the masses to purchase private seedlings, so the county planted more than 25 million masson pine trees, which not only promoted afforestation work but also improved the masses' confidence in seedling cultivation. In particular, in Shandong Province, in order to determine forest rights and land rights and eliminate the concerns of the masses, before afforestation, the masses were led to divide mountains and delineate boundaries on the principles of mutual respect and mutual concession for barren hills and wasteland where land rights had not been clearly delineated or had been improperly distributed in the past, and a spring afforestation plan was drawn up. The masses all expressed that they would never infringe upon each other and were willing to jointly develop forestry. The 2,800 mu of public beach in Haiyang County had been barren for a long time before it was divided. This spring, after it was handled, the nearby masses were overjoyed and organized to carry out spring afforestation.

	IV. Leading cadres in various places have attached importance to afforestation work, personally arranged it, and organized and mobilized the masses to plant trees. For example, the People's Governments of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and northern Anhui provinces and regions summarized experience and allocated seedlings last winter. Before afforestation this spring, a large number of cadres were sent to specifically arrange the planned afforestation of each prefecture and key county, and specialized agencies for guiding afforestation were established in each prefecture and county. Ma Jia, the county magistrate of Guangchang County, Jiangxi Province, personally led 10,000 farmers to complete the afforestation task of 40,000 mu in 35 days. In the key afforestation counties of Shandong Province, county, district, and village cadres, labor models, and activists were convened in late February to conduct five-day short-term training, convey forestry policies, and practice afforestation techniques, which played a great role in promoting afforestation. This spring, the Shandong Provincial People's Government also sent 138 cadres to form an afforestation team to specifically guide coastal afforestation work. In this spring's afforestation in Hebei Province, bulletins were frequently issued to disseminate and exchange experience, which greatly promoted afforestation work throughout the province. After the cadres of leading organs at all levels in the Northeast region realized the great political and economic significance of afforestation work in the new democratic economic construction, they enthusiastically responded to Chairman Gao Gang's call at the enlarged meeting of the western protective forest belt, actively transferred and trained a large number of cadres, and mobilized the masses to launch a large-scale and unprecedented afforestation upsurge. Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, personally went to various counties focusing on the construction of protective forest belts to supervise and inspect, and personally led afforestation in Baicheng County, gained experience, and promoted it in a timely manner, enabling counties with slow action to catch up. Luo Chengde, Chairman of the Rehe Provincial People's Government, personally went to Pingquan, Lingyuan, and other counties to specifically arrange and deeply inspect afforestation and seedling cultivation work, which lasted for a month. In terms of working methods, most counties and districts in western Liaoning, Jilin, and various counties building protective forests in the lower reaches of the Yongding River have established a system of dividing areas, sections, and contracting responsibilities. Western Liaoning Province also piloted a three-part form seedling transportation responsibility system, creating experience in technical management such as seedling cultivation, seedling selection, seedling digging, and transportation for the future. After afforestation, various places vigorously organized a general review, and many shortcomings in afforestation were corrected in a timely manner.

There are also some shortcomings in this spring's afforestation work. For example, leading cadres in some provinces and regions have not paid enough attention to afforestation work, so they are far from completing the annual plan. It is especially worth noting the phenomenon of insufficient seedling supply. For example, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong, and other places generally lack tree seedlings. Some areas in southern Sichuan, Jiangxi, Shandong, and other provinces and regions dug wild tree seedlings or tree roots for afforestation. Farmers in the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan went to northern Shaanxi to buy tree seedlings at a cost of 3,000 yuan per plant. In the Northeast region and Chahar Province, many mother trees suffered undue losses due to the adoption of cuttings. Due to the failure to do a good job in planning and preparation in the Northeast region, the loss of seedlings alone is enough for afforestation on both sides of the entire Northeast highway. In Rehe, Zhejiang, and other provinces, the seedlings cultivated by individual public nurseries failed to meet the needs of the masses, which also caused waste. All of these should arouse high vigilance in various places. In the future, various places need to pay attention to inspecting and summarizing experience, improve the operation and management of public nurseries, vigorously mobilize farmers to cultivate seedlings, and plan autumn seed collection well in order to meet the larger-scale afforestation movement in the future.

    全国春季造林的情况和特点
    全国春季造林工作于四月底基本结束，个别地区到五月上旬亦告完成。根据初步统计，全国共造林五百零二万亩，完成全年造林计划的百分之四十八。其中东北区为一百二十六万亩，中南区为一百八十万亩，华东区为一百四十万亩。今春全国各地群众零星植树一亿五千八百二十八万株，完成全年计划的百分之四十点四。
    今春全国造林工作是结合“三反”运动和抗旱防旱备耕等中心工作进行的，整个工作的开展，表现了如下几种情况和特点：
    一、有计划地展开了消灭山荒和水旱灾害、大力植树造林的运动
　今春东北人民营造东北区西部防护林带，现已造林二万六千零一十八垧，超过原计划百分之二十三，等于东北区一九五一年全年农田防护林带营造面积的一点三倍。河北省永定河下游大兴、固安等四县在短短十四天内完成防风林网总延长达一四七○·四七里，超过原计划百分之四十七。陕北、豫东的防沙林，山东的海滩防护林以及湖南的滨湖堤垸林，均已完成春季营造计划。华东区和中南区的大部省区均以水源山区为重点展开植树造林。淮河上游及其支流史河、淠河山区，山东省沂河、沭河上游的沂蒙山区，浙江省的富春江、浦阳江，江西赣江，湖南澧水、沩水以及广东的西江等河流上游均普遍营造了具有保安和经济性质的水源林。群众对造林认识普遍提高，造林的好处，特别是营造防护林的好处已为群众所接受。如东北区西部防护林带群众对“栽树亏地”“栽树归公”“栽树不得利”等等错误思想已经基本扭转，他们说，“造林十年，强如种田”，“我们是国家的主人，栽树就是替我们自己创造财富”，因而都积极参加造林工作。永定河下游群众热烈响应人民政府号召，他们自己投资营造副林带，并且提出“主林带造到那里，副林带跟到那里”。天津专区安次县王小寨村，二十八个妇女营造了三百公尺长的“妇女爱国林带”并上书河北省主席杨秀峰，保证响应人民政府号召消灭沙荒。山东掖县仓上乡妇女一百三十五人组成一支造林队，在“妇女团结起来向海滩作斗争”的口号下大力植树造林。察哈尔省商都县、怀来县一带，以及平原省邺县和陕西大荔县洛河沿岸的沙荒均在今春开始营造防风林网和护岸林。
    另外向无造林习惯的地区如察哈尔省平鲁县和平原省林县以及川南区的叙永、南溪、屏山等县群众纷纷开展造林工作。林县人民代表会上决议三年内绿化全县荒山荒地十五万亩，今春已完成六万四千多亩。此外浙江省建德县群众热烈推行了“一人十苗”运动，缙云县南溪村做到“家家造林”，这样就使今春造林工作形成了广泛的群众运动。
    二、普遍提高了造林的成活率　一九五一年全国平均造林成活率仅为百分之六十五，也就是说已造的林至少损失百分之三十五。为改进植树技术提高植树的成活率，中央人民政府林业部今春指示各地除完成造林计划外并应以提高造林成活率为主要奋斗目标。这个指示引起了各地区重视，西北区、中南区、以及辽西，热河，绥远，察哈尔，河北，山东等省区都发布了同样的指示。各地农民纷纷研究中央的造林指示，许多造林小组响应号召，提出了提高成活率的保证。东北区强调了抗旱保苗后，大部分干旱地区都能做到了水浸苗、座水栽（即挖坑后，先浇水，后栽树）或栽后灌水等。辽西省造林一万四千多垧，条件好的就座水栽，条件差的就用水浸苗的办法栽种，全部作到了抗旱保苗。吉林省西部五县今春造防护林带除埋干造林外，大部是座水栽的。黑龙江省安广县舍力街在造林那天全屯就出动了三十五辆大车拉水。东北西部防护林带地区的群众对去年秋天造的林都重行培土镇压，保证成活。这是大面积造林在今春出现的空前未有的行动。为了巩固既得成绩，东北林业部在造林总结会议中号召进一步防旱，抚育和加强保护管理以保证提高造林成活率。这一事例给全国造林工作提出了新的标帜。
    三、贯彻了组织起来和谁种归谁的政策组织起来，合作造林，已在全国范围内开展。东北区西部防护林带的大部分地区、永定河下流防风林网以及山东莱阳、文登两专区的海滩防护林地区，全部是以公私合作和私人合作方式完成今春营造计划的。辽西省造林一万四千多垧，合作造林即占百分之九十点六。江西省今春造林大部为公私合作。浙江省杭县仅三个区就组织了七十八个林业生产合作社，共造林一万八千多亩。热河省喀左旗的省林业模范薛东藩造林互助组栽植了自育的黑松苗二十五万株。建平县十三区在省林业劳动模范张俊祥的发动下，组织五个村，一○七户，二十二个小组，共育苗八亩，保证自栽自育，计划一九五四年完成本村绿化任务。东北区各地更以农业生产互助组和造林互助组结合起来，发挥了劳力、工具合作互助力量，提高工作效率。为了鼓励群众造林情绪，各地都贯彻了“谁种归谁”的政策，并帮助群众解决了种苗，土地困难。湖北浠水县由公家垫款，并动员群众购用私苗，因此全县栽植马尾松二千五百多万株，不仅推动了造林工作，同时也提高了群众育苗信心。特别是山东省，为了确定林权地权，解除群众顾虑，在造林前，领导群众，在互尊互让的原则下，对未划清地权或过去分配不当的荒山荒滩，进行了分山划界，并订出今春造林计划。群众都表示决不相犯，愿意共同发展林业。海阳县二千八百亩公滩，未分前长久荒废，今春处理后，附近群众兴高彩烈，纷纷组织起来，展开春季造林。
    四、各地领导干部都重视了造林工作，亲自布置，组织发动群众造林如广东、江西、皖北等省、区人民政府在去年冬季即进行了总结经验，调配种苗。今春造林前，又派出大批干部具体布置各个专区和重点县计划造林，各专区和县以下都建立了指导造林的专门机构。江西省广昌县县长马加并亲自领导一万个农民在三十五天内完成四万亩的造林任务。山东省各造林重点县先后于二月下旬，召集县、区、村干部、劳动模范和积极分子，进行五天短期训练，传达林业政策，实习造林技术，在造林中起了极大的推动作用。今春山东省人民政府又派出干部一百三十八人组成造林队专门指导海滩造林工作。河北省在今春造林中经常发布通报，传播和交流经验，对全省造林工作起了很大的推动作用。东北区各级领导机关干部认识到造林工作在新民主主义经济建设中的重大政治意义和经济意义后，都热烈地响应了高岗主席在西部防护林带扩大会议上的号召，积极地抽调和训练了大批干部，发动群众展开了大规模的空前的造林热潮。黑龙江省人民政府主席于毅夫亲自到防护林带重点营造的各县督促检查，并在白城县亲自领导造林，获得了经验及时推广，使行动迟缓的县份得以迎头赶上。热河省人民政府主席罗成德亲赴平泉、凌源等县具体布置，深入检查造林育苗工作，历时一月。在工作方法上，辽西、吉林大部县区以及永定河下游营造防护林各县，都建立了分区分段包干负责制。辽西省并试行三联单运苗责任制，给今后育苗、选苗、掘苗、运输等技术管理上创造了经验。造林后各地又大力组织过普遍复查工作，造林中许多缺点都及时地得到纠正。
    今春造林工作中也存在着一些缺点。例如某些省区领导干部未很好重视造林工作，因而距完成全年计划相去尚远。尤其值得注意的是苗木不够供应的现象。例如察哈尔、绥远、河北、山东等地普遍缺乏树苗。川南、江西、山东等省区部分地区挖野生树秧或树根来造林。绥远伊克昭盟农民远赴陕北花三千元一株的代价买树栽子。东北区及察哈尔省很多母树因采取插条而遭到不应有的损失。东北区由于未作好计划和准备工作仅苗木损失即足供全东北公路两侧造林之用。热河、浙江等省个别的公营苗圃所育苗木未能适合群众需要，也形成浪费。这些都应引起各地的高度警惕。今后各地需注意检查和总结经验，改进公营苗圃的经营管理，大力发动农民育苗，并很好计划秋季采种工作，以便迎接今后更大规模的造林运动。（新华社）
