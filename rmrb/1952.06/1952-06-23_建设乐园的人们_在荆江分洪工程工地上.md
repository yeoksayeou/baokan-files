People Building Paradise
--On the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Construction Site
By our correspondent Bai Yuan

In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from Zhijiang County in Hubei Province to Chenglingji in Hunan Province, lies what people call the Jingjiang River. The mighty Yangtze, after passing through the perilous Three Gorges, flows into a vast plain here. The silt carried by the river from upstream accumulates here, creating many large and small sandbars in the river, and countless shallow shoals on the riverbed. The blocked river water often overflows, bringing endless disasters to the people on both banks.

The days that people have dreamed of for generations have finally arrived. In order to conquer the flood, the People's Government began to harness the Yangtze River. According to the first step of the People's Government's plan, a flood diversion area will be established from Taipingkou on the south bank of the Yangtze River to Ouchikou, and from the north bank of Anxiang River to the east bank of the Hutuo River to the bank of the Yangtze River; at Taipingkou at the northern end of this flood diversion area, a huge flood gate will be built; once the Yangtze River flood breaks out, the flood will be released from here into the flood diversion area. In order to control the flood, a control gate will be built at the southern end of the flood diversion area, at the foot of Huangshantou in Shishou County, Hubei Province, and the embankments around the flood diversion area will be repaired and reinforced at the same time.

A train of sailing boats, along the Yangtze River, carries sand, stones and steel. A total of more than 200,000 migrant workers and soldiers have come here to participate in this great construction. At night, the banks of the Yangtze River are brightly lit, and the songs of labor are sung from one morning to another.

Thirty miles west of Shashi by small steamboat is Taipingkou. Standing on the Yangtze River embankment here and looking forward, the vast wilderness is covered with temporary thatched houses. Countless red flags are scattered on the construction site. More than 100 miles of light railway extend throughout the construction site. The PLA soldiers, workers and farmers participating in the transportation are pushing long dump trucks full of stones and speeding forward. At the entrance of the light railway, a red and green light made of wooden boards is installed. The inspectors standing at each railway intersection are constantly waving red and green flags, directing the traffic of the entire construction site. "Hurry up, come on!" Groups of PLA soldiers shouted and ran behind the rumbling dump trucks. Those farmers who had never pushed a dump truck before often ran and pushed for a while, then jumped on the frame and let the truck speed forward automatically. They stood on the frame and laughed heartily.

Walk along the crisscrossing light railways towards the center of the construction site. Bypass the grass sheds with roaring motors, and in a triangular area on the east bank of the Hutuo River and the south bank of the Yangtze River is the location of the first large water gate in New China - the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate. From the revetment of the sluice gate to the erected gate top, the working people blocked the sky. Countless large loudspeakers on both sides of the sluice gate broadcast all kinds of beautiful music and moving songs in the world. In the rumbling sound of the concrete mixer and the collision of steel, a earth-shattering shout rang out:

"Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!..." A young female comrade held a large loudspeaker and stood in the rolling crowd, shouting with a loud voice. A huge song of labor echoed her:

Comrades,
--Hey yo ho!
Work hard,
--Hey yo ho!
Conquer the flood,
--Hey yo ho!
Build paradise!
--Hey yo ho...

The project is progressing rapidly. The workers climbed on the high scaffolding and began to install the gate. They waved the hammers in their hands and shook the entire sky. Countless pneumatic riveters made a "giggling..." laugh.

The sun quietly set, and the lights on the construction site lit up. People worked day and night. The white light of the electric lights shone on the sky, and the electric light net weaved a brilliant Milky Way along the sluice gate. The welders installing the gate emitted dazzling lightning in their hands. Next to the sluice gate, the workers and PLA soldiers were building the revetment of the sluice gate. The concrete mixer kept turning along the revetment. The workers took care of the machine and directed the PLA soldiers to load gravel, sand, cement and water into the machine. The PLA soldiers pushed handcarts, filled with cart after cart of concrete mixed by the machine, and sped towards the revetment. They were engaged in a labor competition. Dozens of mixers rumbled, and the concrete was constantly poured on the base plate of the revetment, filling one piece after another. A soldier pushed a handcart and walked to a steep slope. There was a puddle of mud at the corner of the steep slope, and he stood there hesitantly for a while. Another soldier ran over, trying to snatch the handcart. Because he ran too fast, he slipped into the puddle of mud. The soldier in front put down the handcart and helped the soldier who had slipped out of the mud, laughing and saying, "Look at you! So anxious." The soldier who stood up from the mud said, "You are not anxious, but I am! Who can watch others become heroes and fall behind? Hurry up! You alone will drag everyone behind!" A worker standing next to the machine silently took a straw mat and laid it on the puddle of mud, so that the handcart could continue to speed past. Looking at these moving scenes, anyone would think: how lovely people are! Here, there is no estrangement, no jealousy. People are holding hands, singing and working together for a common cause. No force can separate them.

The half-moon was covered by dark clouds, and the wind blew with rain. The climate in the wilderness suddenly became like late autumn. Should we go to the work shed to take shelter? No one thought so, let alone did so. A worker holding an iron shovel, soaked all over, stood in front of a small shed, staring blankly. The lights on all sides reflected his smiling face, making people feel happy and joyful.

One morning, a long line of people walked over to the river where the sailing boats were parked. There was a flag in front of the team, and there were many women dressed in red and green in the team. They walked and sang. This is the team composed of sailors and their families. They participated in the great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. After completing the transportation task, they came to carry out voluntary labor. They call this voluntary labor the Stone Donation Movement. They want to transport the stones they transported to the construction site instead of the porters. There was a nine-year-old girl named Chen Cuie, and a ten-year-old girl named Tang Jinlian. The two of them carried a small basket, and their cheeks were flushed from exertion. When those adults saw them, they always told them with praise: "Cuiezi, Jinlianzi, carry them well, don't hit your feet!"

Speaking of women, there are many stories. On the construction site of the Huangshantou Control Gate, there were more than 300 women from Yichang City aged from 15 to 40 years old. When the news of the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project reached Yichang, everyone went to the government to sign up, and the women also wanted to participate. At the beginning, the local government did not allow women to participate because of taking care of women's health. So they clamored: "Saying that women have turned over, such a big thing does not allow us to go, what kind of turn over is it!" They repeatedly asked the government, and finally they were approved.

There is a woman from Yidu County named Zhang Maozhen, who is only twenty-one years old this year. However, the suffering she has suffered in the past cannot be described in a lifetime. Her father and mother died early because they could not bear the suffering of the old society. A lonely girl, carrying water, doing odd jobs, and suffering bullying and humiliation. After liberation, Zhang Maozhen was no longer bullied by others. She slowly got better by her own hard work. Last year, she married a young man from her hometown, and the two lived a happy life together. When everyone began to participate in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the two of them signed up together. At that time, everyone was afraid that her body could not bear it, and when she arrived at the construction site, they still persuaded her to go home, but she refused. Some people said, "Look, no other couple came here together, only you two, you just can't bear to leave him, that's why you don't want to go back!" She said that she just couldn't bear to leave him, couldn't bear to leave today's happy life, so she came here. She worked actively on the construction site and has been admitted to the New Democratic Youth League and became a special model for the great construction of the motherland.

In just two and a half months, the Chinese people completed this great construction project at a speed rare in the world. Now, the rice seedlings are green on both sides of the Yangtze River, and millions of mu of fertile land will no longer be threatened by floods; the happy days have finally arrived.

    建设乐园的人们
    ——在荆江分洪工程工地上
    本报记者　白　原
    在长江的中游，从湖北省的枝江县到湖南省的城陵矶，这就是人们所说的荆江。滚滚的长江经过险峻的三峡，在这里流入一片广阔的平原。江水从上游带来的泥沙，在这里淤积起来，在江流中造成许多大大小小的沙洲，和无数江底的浅滩。被阻塞的江水常常泛滥，给两岸的人民带来无穷无尽的灾难。
    人们世世代代梦想的日子终于来到了。为了战胜洪水，人民政府开始治理长江。按照人民政府的第一步计划，由长江南岸的太平口南至藕池口和安乡河北岸，由虎渡河东岸东至长江岸边，建立一个分洪区；在这个分洪区北端的太平口，建筑一座巨大的进洪闸；一旦长江洪水暴发，即将洪水从这里放进分洪区。为了节制洪水，在分洪区南端、湖北省石首县黄山头脚下，建筑一座节制闸，同时修筑和加固分洪区周围的堤岸。
    一列一列的帆船，沿着长江，载来沙子、石头和钢铁。到这里来参加这个伟大建设的民工和军工，一共有二十多万人。入夜，长江岸上电灯辉煌，劳动的歌声，从一个早晨唱到另一个早晨。
    从沙市乘小汽船西行三十里，就是太平口。站在这里的长江堤岸上往前一望，茫茫的原野上，布满了临时搭起的草房。无数红旗散布在工地上。一百多里长的轻便铁路在整个工地上伸延着。参加运输的解放军战士、工人和农民，推着长长的装满石块的斗车，向前飞奔。在轻便铁路的进口处，安设了一盏用木板做成的红绿灯，站在每一个铁路交叉线上的纠察队员，不停地挥动红绿旗子，指挥着整个工地的交通。“快呀，加油呵！”一群一群的解放军战士，在隆隆飞驰着的斗车后面吆喝着，奔跑着。那些从来没有推过斗车的农民，常常飞跑着推了一段，然后跳上车架，让车子自动地向前飞驰。他们则站在车架上纵情大笑。
    沿着纵横交错的轻便铁路向着工地的中心走去。绕过那些响着马达的草棚，在虎渡河的东岸和长江南岸的一个三角地带上，这就是新中国的第一个大水闸——太平口进洪闸的所在地。从水闸的护坡到已经架设起来的闸顶上，劳动的人群遮住了天空。水闸两旁的无数大广播筒，播送着世界上各种美妙的音乐和动人的歌曲。在那混凝土拌合机的隆隆声和那钢铁的碰击声中，响起了震动天地的喊声：
    “快呀！快呀！快呀！……”一个年青的女同志举着一个大喇叭筒，站在那滚滚的人群中间，用响亮的嗓子呼喊着。一片巨大的劳动的歌声回应着她：
    同志们呀，
    ——咳哟嗬！
    快快干哪，
    ——咳哟嗬！
    战胜洪水，
    ——咳哟嗬！
    建乐园呵！
    ——咳哟嗬……
    工程飞快地进展着。工人们爬在高高的棚架上，开始安装闸门了。他们挥着手上的铁锤，把整个天空都敲打得震动起来了。无数风铆机的铆钉，发出一片“咯咯咯咯……”的笑声。
    太阳悄悄地落下去，工地上的电灯亮起来。人们夜以继日地劳动着。电灯的白光照耀着天空，电灯网沿着水闸，织成一条灿烂的银河。安装闸门的电焊工人手上发出耀眼的闪电。在水闸的旁边，那些工人和解放军的战士们正在建筑水闸的护坡。混凝土拌合机沿着护坡不停地转动着。工人们一边照管机器，一边指挥解放军的战士们往机器里装碎石、沙子、水泥和水。解放军的战士们推着手车，装满了一车车由机器拌好了的混凝土，向护坡上飞驰而去。他们正在进行着劳动竞赛。数十部拌合机隆隆地响着，混凝土不断地倾倒在护坡的底板上，灌满一片又一片。有一个战士推着一辆手车，走到一个陡坡上。陡坡的转角处有一滩泥水，他站在那里犹疑了一会儿。另一个战士跑过来，想把手车抢上去。因为跑得太急，一下子滑倒在那一滩泥水里。前边的战士把手车放下，把那个滑倒了的战士从泥水里扶起来，一面咯咯地笑着：“你看你！急成这个样子。”从泥水里站起来的战士说：“你不急，我可急！谁能看着人家当英雄，自己落在后面？还不快跑！你一个人要把大家都拖在后面了！”一个站在机器旁的工人，不声不响地拿着一块草垫子，铺在那一滩泥水上，让手车继续飞跑过去。看着这些动人的情景，谁都会想：人是多么可爱呵！在这里，没有隔阂，没有妒忌，人们为了一个共同的事业，手挽着手，一同歌唱，一同劳动，无论什么力量，也不能分开他们的。
    半圆的月亮被乌云遮住了，风夹着雨吹过来了。荒野上的气候，骤然变得好像深秋一样。到工棚里躲一躲吗？没有人这样想，更没有人这样作。一个工人手里拿着一把铁锨，全身淋得湿漉漉的，站在
    一个小棚子前面，呆呆地看着。四面的灯光映照着他那张微笑的面孔，使人感到幸福和愉快。
    一个早晨，在那些帆船停泊的江边，一列长长的队伍走过来。队伍前面举着一面旗子，队伍里面有许多穿得红红绿绿的妇女。他们一边走着，一边唱着。这是船员们和他们的家属所组成的队伍。他们参加了伟大的荆江分洪工程，他们完成了运输任务以后，又来实行义务劳动。他们把这种义务劳动叫做献石运动。他们要把自己运到的石头，代替搬运工人，运到工地上去。有一个九岁的女孩子叫陈翠娥，一个十岁的女孩子叫唐金莲，她们两个人抬着一个小筐子，她们的脸颊因为用力而涨得通红。那些大人们看见她们，总是带着夸奖的口气嘱咐她们：“翠伢子，金伢子，好好抬，不要把脚打着呵！”
    提起妇女们来，故事可多呢。在黄山头节制闸那边的工地上，有三百多个四十多岁到十五岁的从宜昌市来的妇女。建设荆江分洪工程的消息传到宜昌的时候，大家都到政府去报名，妇女们也要参加。开始的时候，当地政府因为照顾妇女们的身体，不让妇女们参加。于是她们就嚷着：“说妇女翻身，这样大的事情也不让我们去，翻个什么身呀！”她们一次又一次地向政府请求，最后还是被批准了。
    有一个宜都县的妇女，名叫张茂贞，今年才二十一岁。但是，她过去所受的折磨，一辈子也说不完。她的父亲和母亲，因为受不了旧社会的苦，很早就死了。一个孤零零的女孩子，给人家挑水、做零工，受尽了欺负和侮辱。解放以后，张茂贞再也不受人家的欺负了。她靠着自己辛勤的劳动，生活慢慢地好起来了。在去年她和本乡的一个年青人结了婚，两个人在一起过着幸福的生活。大家开始参加荆江分洪工程的时候，他们两个人一起报了名。那时候，大家怕她的身体受不了，到了工地上，还是劝她回家去，但是她怎么也不肯。就有人说：“你看别人没有两口子一起到这里来的，只有你们两口子，你就是舍不得他才不肯回去吧！”她说，她就是舍不得他，舍不得今天的幸福生活，所以才来到这里的。她在工地上积极劳动，已被吸收参加了新民主主义青年团，并且成为祖国伟大建设的特等模范。
    仅仅两个半月的时间，中国人民以世界上稀有的速度，完成了这个伟大的建设工程。现在，长江两岸禾苗青青，几百万亩肥沃的土地，再也不会遭受洪水的威胁；幸福的日子终于到来了。（附图片）
