    Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government
    Response to Opinions from Various Parties Regarding Subsidy Standards

    Since the trial implementation of the unified increase in subsidy measures for personnel under the supply system nationwide in March of this year, personnel from various localities and units have continuously written letters to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and the People's Daily, reflecting the trial implementation situation and proposing improvement suggestions. These letters have been carefully studied by the Ministry. Correct and reasonable opinions that can be implemented at present have been adopted in the revised subsidy standards; some opinions that cannot be adopted temporarily for some reason will be reserved for further study later. The new draft standard is currently under review by the Government Administration Council; if there are still opinions from various parties after it is promulgated, we hope you will inform us at any time.

    中央人民政府人事部
    答覆各方面关于津贴标准的意见
    今年三月全国供给制工作人员统一增加津贴办法试行以来，各地方、各单位的工作人员，曾陆续写信给毛主席、周总理和人民日报，反映试行情况和提出改进意见。这些信件均经本部慎重研究。其中正确的、合理的、目前可能执行的意见，已在修订津贴标准时予以采纳；其中部分意见因某种原因暂时还不能采纳的，则留待以后继续研究。现在新的标准草案，政务院正在审核中；颁行后各方面如仍有意见，希望随时告诉我们。
