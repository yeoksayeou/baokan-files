    Do a Good Job in Grain Storage
    Zhou Kangmin, Manager of China National Grain Corporation
    During the current season, grain in granaries across the country is most susceptible to mold and insect infestation. Cadres responsible for grain storage should strengthen their efforts to protect the grain. Since the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Grain Storage Work" in mid-March, many state-owned grain enterprises, under the leadership of local Party and government departments, have successively convened meetings on grain protection, organized forces to inspect grain warehouses, and prevented and dealt with incidents of grain spoilage in some units. However, up to now, some state-owned grain enterprises in some regions have relaxed their grain storage work, and the phenomena of grain continuing to heat up, mold, and be eaten by insects are still very serious. According to incomplete statistics from the North China, Central South, and East China regions, the total amount of grain damaged by insects, mold, and deterioration has reached more than 200 million catties. For example, in Guangdong and Henan in the Central South region, and in southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong in the East China region, the total amount of grain infested with insects has reached 200 million catties. The fourth warehouse in Guangdong Province had 42 insects per catty of rice; the rice eaten by insects in Gaolei Branch Company crumbled into powder when pinched; 80 percent of the wheat and sorghum in Huaidian Branch Company in Henan Province were eaten by insects. In Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang in southern Jiangsu in East China, each catty of wheat had 332 insects; according to preliminary inspections of grain storage in Shanghai, 4.8 million catties of white rice, 2 million catties of brown rice, and 4 million catties of rice paddy have changed color and taste, and there is a phenomenon of heating up. The phenomenon of mold and insect infestation in grain storage in North China is also very serious. This serious situation cannot be allowed to continue to develop and urgently needs to be changed, otherwise it will cause more serious losses to the country.
    The reasons for the mold and insect infestation of stored grain in various regions are mainly due to the fact that some cadres responsible for grain work do not adequately recognize the importance of grain storage and demonstrate an intolerable attitude of麻痹, carelessness, and indifference towards the country's grain; they have various subjective, one-sided, and incorrect ideas. For example, some state-owned grain enterprises in North China mistakenly believe that "the climate is good in the north in spring, and the grain will not spoil," and "there were no major problems with grain last spring, and there will be no problems this year." They lack in-depth supervision and inspection in their work, thus causing damage to the grain.
    Some cadres have also emphasized the current difficulties in grain storage work but lack the confidence and determination to overcome them. Are there any difficulties in the current grain storage work? Yes, there are. For example, there was a lot of rain in various places last year, and the harvested grain had a high moisture content. The moisture content of grain entering the pass from Northeast China is generally around 24 percent, and the moisture content of miscellaneous grains nationwide is generally between 15 and 17 percent; also, the storage tasks are large, but the equipment and construction of grain warehouses are far from meeting the needs of the tasks; some grain storage and transportation organizations are not sound, and there is a shortage of personnel, etc., all of which are difficulties in grain storage work. However, as long as the cadres of our state-owned grain trading enterprises work together and fully exert their work enthusiasm and creativity, it is possible to overcome difficulties and ensure that the country's grain suffers little or no loss.
    A few grain cadres in some regions even use the "Three-Anti" movement and being busy with work as excuses for grain spoilage and shirk their responsibilities, which is extremely wrong. The "Three-Anti" movement is to clear the way for a large-scale increase in production and savings movement, so we must never pit the "Three-Anti" movement against the current work and sit idly by while the country's grain suffers losses. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the thinking of the vast majority of cadres in state-owned grain enterprises has been improved, but a few cadres have seen that there are many grafters in the storage and transportation departments in the "Three-Anti" movement, and the current storage task is heavy and there are many difficulties, so they have developed pessimistic ideas such as "grain work is not rewarding" and "there is no future," which should be quickly overcome. It should be known that doing a good job in grain storage is a great contribution to the country and the people. Grafters are punished because they have betrayed the interests of the people, and only by eliminating these grafters can we ensure that the work is done well.
    In response to the above situation, in order to strengthen grain protection work, the grain storage departments in various regions must take the following measures:
    First, state-owned grain enterprise units in various regions and provinces must attach importance to grain protection work and regard the current grain protection work as one of the most important central tasks. Responsible cadres of state-owned grain enterprises at all levels should personally lead this work and not just hand it over to the storage and transportation departments; and they should quickly mobilize all employees, educate employees to actively participate in grain protection work with the spirit of patriotism, and completely eliminate the phenomena of mold and insect infestation in grain warehouses.
    Second, state-owned grain enterprise units in various regions and provinces should take an active attitude, under the leadership of local Party and government departments, quickly adjust cadres, improve storage and transportation organizations and grain protection organizations, organize forces, and conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of stored grain.
    Third, in grain protection work, we must effectively grasp the moisture content of the grain, the degree of insect infestation and mold, etc., so that we know what we are doing. In order to facilitate the grasp of the grain moisture situation, the grain can be roughly divided into four categories: The first category is safe grain, that is, grain with a moisture content of 13 percent or less. As long as you pay attention to regular inspections of this type of grain, you can safely spend the summer without turning over or ventilating. The second category is sorted grain, that is, grain with a moisture content of more than 13 percent to 16 percent. For this type of grain, ventilation and turning over are necessary. The third category is dangerous grain, that is, grain with a moisture content of more than 16 percent to 18 percent. This type of grain must be spread out, turned over, and dried. The fourth category is processed grain, that is, grain with a moisture content of more than 18 percent. For this type of grain, we must take measures such as selling and processing it.
    Fourth, regarding the problem of insect infestation, grain that has been infested with insects should be eliminated with insecticidal powder, agents, and other effective methods. For warehouses that have not yet been infested with insects, the surrounding environment of the warehouse should be cleaned and disinfected.
    Fifth, restore and improve various systems. Make full preparations for rain and flood prevention.
    Sixth, grain enterprises in various regions should report the situation and difficult problems of grain protection, such as drying yards, repairing warehouses, and adding utensils, to the local leading organs in a timely manner and study solutions. When there are not enough warehouses, it can be suggested that the local financial committee uniformly adjust the use, lease, or borrow them.
    All employees of state-owned grain enterprises have improved in their thinking and work after this great "Three-Anti" movement. In the future, they must continue to strive for the complete victory of grain protection work on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement.

    做好粮食保管工作
    中国粮食公司经理  周康民
    在目前的季节里，各地粮食仓库的粮食，最容易发生霉烂、生虫事故，保管粮食的有关干部，应加强护粮工作。自三月中旬中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会发出“加强粮食保管工作指示”后，不少国营粮食企业在当地党政部门领导下，先后召开了护粮工作会议，组织力量检查粮食仓库，防止并处理某些单位粮食霉坏的事件。但至目前为止，仍有部分地区的国营粮食企业单位，放松了对存粮的保管工作，存粮继续发热、霉烂、被虫蚀等的现象仍很严重。就华北、中南、华东三区不完全统计，虫蚀、霉坏、变质的粮食总数已达二亿多斤。如中南区的广东、河南，华东区的苏南、皖北、山东等地，生虫的粮食总数达二亿斤。广东省第四仓库稻谷每斤有虫四十二只；高雷分公司被虫蚀的大米一捏成粉；河南省槐店支公司的小麦、红粮被虫蚀的占百分之八十。华东区苏南无锡、常州、镇江每斤小麦生虫三百三十二个；上海市的粮食保管情况，据初步检查，已有白米四百八十万斤、糙米二百万斤、稻谷四百万斤变色变味，且有发热现象。华北区存粮霉烂、生虫现象也很严重。这一严重情况不容许继续发展，急需加以改变，否则将会给国家造成更严重的损失。
    各地存粮发生霉烂、虫蚀的原因，主要是由于某些负责粮食工作的干部对保管粮食的重要性认识不足，对国家的粮食表现了不能容忍的麻痹、大意和漠不关心的态度；他们有各种各样主观、片面、不正确的思想。例如华北地区某些国营粮食企业单位，有的领导干部错误地认为“北方春季气候好，坏不了粮食”，“去年春天粮食没大问题，今年也不会出毛病”。他们在工作上缺乏深入的督促和检查，因而造成粮食的损坏。
    也有一些干部，强调了当前在粮食保管工作上的困难，但缺乏克服困难的信心和决心。当前在粮食保管工作上有没有困难呢？有的。如去年各地雨水多，收获粮食水分大，东北进关粮食所含水分一般在百分之二十四上下，全国杂粮所含水分一般在百分之十五至十七；又如储存任务大，但粮食仓库的设备和修建远赶不上任务的需要；某些粮食储运机构不健全，人员不足等，都是粮食保管工作上的困难。但是，只要我们国营粮食贸易企业的干部齐心努力，充分发挥工作积极性、创造性，是可以克服困难，使国家的粮食免受或少受损失的。
    有些地区的少数粮食干部竟以进行“三反”运动，工作忙，为霉烂粮食的藉口，推卸责任，这更是极端错误的。“三反”运动是为了给大规模增产节约运动扫清道路，所以绝不能把“三反”运动和当前工作对立起来，坐视国家粮食遭受损失。“三反”运动以后，广大国营粮食企业的干部思想已经提高了一步，但有少数干部看到“三反”运动中储运部门贪污分子较多，目前保管任务重，困难多，因而产生了“粮食工作费力不讨好”，“没有前途”等的消极思想，这都应该迅速克服。须知做好粮食保管工作就是对国家对人民极大的贡献。贪污分子受惩罚，是因为他们背叛了人民的利益，也只有肃清了这些贪污分子，才能保证把工作做好。
    针对上述情况，为了加强护粮工作，各地保管粮食的部门必须采取如下措施：
    第一、各区省国营粮食企业单位要重视护粮工作，要把目前护粮工作作为最主要的中心工作之一。各级国营粮食企业负责干部应亲自领导这一工作，不能把它只交给储运部门去做；并应迅速发动全体职工，教育职工以爱国主义的精神积极参加护粮工作，彻底消灭粮食仓库中的霉坏和虫害现象。
    第二、各区省国营粮食企业单位，应采取积极态度，在当地党政部门的领导下，迅速调整干部，健全储运机构和护粮组织，组织力量，全面地深入地进行库存粮食的检查工作。
    第三、在护粮工作中要切实掌握粮食水分大小，虫害、霉坏程度等情况，作到心中有数。为了便于掌握粮食水分情况，可以把粮食大体分为四类：第一类，安全粮，即水分在百分之十三以下者。对这类粮食只要经常注意检查，就可以安全度夏，不再进行翻倒出风等工作。第二类，整理粮，即水分在百分之十三以上至十六的粮食。对这类粮食，必须进行出风倒垛。第三类，危险粮，即水分在百分之十六以上至十八的粮食。对这类粮食必须进行摊晾、翻晒、烘干。第四类，处理粮，即水分在百分之十八以上的粮食。对这类粮食，要采取出售、加工等办法，积极处理。
    第四、关于虫害问题，已生虫的粮食，要用杀虫药粉、药剂及其他有效的办法消灭。对现在还没有发生虫害的仓库，要进行仓库周围环境的清洁卫生和包装器材的消毒工作，消灭遗虫、遗卵。
    第五、恢复与健全各种制度。对防雨、防汛、要作充分的准备工作。
    第六、各地粮食企业单位，应把护粮的情况和困难问题如晒场、补修仓库、添置用具等，向当地领导机关及时汇报并研究解决。仓库不足时可建议当地财委统一调整使用，或租赁，或借用。
    全体国营粮食企业单位的职工经过这次伟大的“三反”运动，在思想、工作方面都提高了一步，今后必须在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，继续争取护粮工作的完全胜利。
