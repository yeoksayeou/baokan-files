Martyr Fang Zhimin's posthumous work "Lovely China" was previously photo-offset printed in three thousand copies by the Shanghai Publishing Company last year. In order to make this work, full of revolutionary fighting spirit and enthusiastic patriotism, widely available, the People's Literature Publishing House has typeset a popular edition based on the photo-offset edition. Feng Xuefeng's explanation for the photo-offset edition is still attached to the end of the book. Feng Xuefeng's explanation recounts the origin of these posthumous works brought out of prison, and believes that this is a book that will have a long-term educational effect on young people, and also a very real, beautiful, and powerful literary work.

    方志敏烈士遗著“可爱的中国”出版
    方志敏烈士的遗著“可爱的中国”，曾于去年由上海出版公司影印三千册。为使这本充满革命的战斗精神和热情的爱国主义思想的著作能够普遍发行起见，人民文学出版社根据影印本排印了一种普及本。冯雪峰为影印本写的说明仍附书末。冯雪峰的说明记述了这些从狱中携出的遗著的来历，并认为这是一本将对青年发生长远教育作用的书，也是一部非常真实、优美和有力量的文学作品。
