    Striving for High Yields Per Unit Area
    -- On the Patriotic Production Increase Movement of the Chahayang Farm
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    Visiting the Chahayang Farm during the spring plowing season is particularly exciting. Tractors roar as they cultivate the fields; trucks, one after another, transport seeds and fertilizers to the fields; workers at the water conservancy project tirelessly build new irrigation canals with strong arms. Everywhere there is intense labor, everywhere there are joyful songs.
    The Chahayang Farm is located on the great plains east of the Greater Khingan Mountains and west of the Nenjiang River. It is the largest state-run mechanized farm for both paddy and dry land in Heilongjiang Province. Currently, the farm's more than one thousand employees are working hard to fulfill the patriotic production increase competition conditions they proposed to state-run farms across the country. They said:
    "We must ensure that every piece of land on the farm yields high output." They aim for 5,560 catties of rice per hectare, 2,284 catties of wheat, and 2,944 catties of soybeans; which is 39 percent, 63 percent and 28 percent higher than the yields of local farmers respectively. Under the climatic conditions of northern Manchuria, it is truly gratifying to be able to achieve such high average yields on 3,320 hectares of rice, 755 hectares of wheat, and 544 hectares of soybeans. But the workers of Chahayang Farm are not satisfied with this. They said: In addition to completing the state's production tasks, we will increase production and save 5 million catties of rice, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and support our most beloved people -- the Chinese People's Volunteers."
        One sunny day, I visited the Fourth Work Zone. The Fourth Work Zone has a total of 1,100 hectares of land, all of which are paddy fields. Except for 30 hectares of land used for crop rotation to grow soybeans and pasture, all cultivated land is planted with rice. In order to better fulfill the demonstration role of state-run farms in production, Chahayang Farm has designated demonstration areas for all the crops it cultivates. The farm's 200-hectare rice demonstration field is located in the Fourth Work Zone. These 200 hectares of demonstration rice are expected to reach a high yield of 8,000 to 10,000 catties per hectare, one to one and a half times higher than the yields of local farmers.
    The Fourth Work Zone is cultivated by Wang Shilin's mechanized耕作 team.
    Wang Shilin is the son of a farmhand. He came to the farm to learn how to operate tractors when the farm was established in 1948. In 1950, he applied advanced Soviet experience to implement joint operations with tractors pulling multiple agricultural implements, creating a record of plowing 127.69 hectares in one day, exceeding the state's efficiency quota by 50 percent; fuel consumption was also reduced by 50 percent. When sowing wheat in 1951, he exceeded the state quota by 39 percent, creating a new record of sowing 96 hectares per day. Because of his great achievements in production, he was selected as a special-class labor model in Heilongjiang Province. This year, he was promoted to captain of the mechanized耕作 team of the Fourth Work Zone.
    Even after becoming captain, Wang Shilin cannot stay away from his beloved tractor. He patrols the fields from morning till night, going from one mechanized耕作 team to another, climbing from one tractor to another, inspecting and giving instructions. To help his team members master the technology more quickly, he often jumps onto the tractor and operates it himself, demonstrating for the novices. Wang Shilin is the secretary of the Communist Youth League in the Fourth Work Zone. He attaches great importance to the education of the League members and the League's mass work. When inspecting work, he always reads the newspaper and talks about current affairs to everyone. From April 14th to 20th, it rained and snowed heavily for several days in a row, and the tractors could not go down to the fields to plow. He took advantage of this opportunity to lead each team to study operating procedures and review the patriotic pacts during the day, and in the evenings he mobilized everyone to hold entertainment parties. Under his leadership, the team members worked both hard and happily.
    The weather in northern Manchuria is very cold. There are only 120 frost-free days throughout the year. The growing season for rice is also 120 days. Therefore, it is necessary to sow in a timely manner. A slight delay will cause the rice to be harvested poorly due to insufficient growing season. In order to seize the time, Wang Shilin's tractor team moved to the fields to live, so as to avoid wasting time going back and forth. There were no houses in the fields, so they built temporary shacks. At night, the weather was cold, and people shivered in the damp shacks, but no one complained of hardship. They worked day and night in order to seize the time. It is very difficult to plow at night, and it is easiest to repeat and miss areas. Repetition wastes working time and fuel; omissions affect the quality of work, and the crops will not grow well in the future. The tractor of Hu Jiye's team did not have lights, which made the work even more difficult. But the team members said: "The season waits for no one, we'll work without lights." The assistant waved a white towel to lead the way in front, and the driver watched the shadow in front to move forward. The weather got colder in the second half of the night, and the "puddled" mud stuck to the harrow blades, freezing in a short time. This situation seriously affected the efficiency of the operation. The quality of the plowed land was also not good. Shi Jinsheng, the tractor assistant of Kou Wenyuan's team and a member of the Communist Youth League, used his hands to remove the mud sticking to the harrow blades, creating favorable working conditions for the driver. The next night, he brought a small iron rod and used the iron rod to knock off the mud on the harrow blades. Who would be willing to fall behind in the patriotic production increase movement? Shi Jinsheng's creative labor immediately spread throughout the team and quickly became everyone's practical action.
    This is how Wang Shilin's mechanized耕作 team worked. They not only overcame the difficulties given by nature and completed the spring plowing work as scheduled, creating conditions for timely sowing, but also created new working methods in the operation. According to the land conditions, the farm's technical guidance office planned to harrow six times to meet agricultural requirements. The Wang Shilin's mechanized耕作 team members gave full play to their creativity, increased the weight of the harrow implement, and attached a "拖子 [trailer-like object]" behind the harrow. In this way, four harrowings achieved the quality of six harrowings, not only saving the machine wear and manpower of those two harrowings, seizing time, but also saving the fuel for those two harrowings. Comrade Wang Shilin said: "This is just the beginning. In the future, we must do everything possible in sowing, harvesting,耕地 [plowing]... to improve efficiency and save fuel. We will save 40,000 catties of diesel fuel for the country throughout the year." This is just a corner of the production increase and conservation situation in the Fourth Work Zone. In the entire work zone, the mechanized耕作 teams have their own production increase and conservation plans, the agricultural work teams have their own production increase and conservation plans, the collectives have their own plans, and individuals have their own plans. The entire work zone plans to increase rice production by more than 1.6 million catties by increasing the yield per unit area. Together with other aspects of production increase and conservation, this year it will create more than 2.3 million catties of above-plan wealth for the country.
    "We are a group of brave girls,
        All have lofty ideals for building the motherland...
        From the emancipated countryside... we came to this border of the motherland.
        Forming the first female tractor team in new China,
        Liang Jun is our captain."
    This is a song sung by the young members of the Liang Jun Female Tractor Team as they drive their "steel horses" and sow wheat intensively in the spring fields. This year, the area sown with wheat in the First Work Zone accounts for more than half of the farm's total wheat area. In northern Manchuria, sowing wheat on a large area is an intense struggle. Northern Manchuria often experiences spring droughts and autumn floods. When the seeds germinate and grow and need water, the weather is dry and the ground is dry; during the wheat harvesting season, there is often continuous rainy weather. This kind of natural disaster is particularly harmful to large-area operations. In 1951, although the farm's more than 1,600 hectares of wheat grew very well, it rained for more than 60 consecutive days before and after the wheat harvest. The machines could not go down to the ground. How could such a large area be harvested manually? As a result, much of the wheat was not harvested, "yielding a bumper crop but not reaping a bumper harvest." To obtain a bumper harvest, it is necessary to implement a new cultivation method -- sowing early. In this way, the water from melting snow can be used to make the seeds germinate smoothly, so as to advance the maturity period and avoid the harm of rainy weather. Therefore, spring wheat sowing operations have become a very tense combat operation, and the labor enthusiasm and wisdom of everyone must be fully utilized, and the efficiency of the machinery must be fully utilized. Only by competing with time and defeating time can a bumper harvest be obtained. The Liang Jun Female Tractor Team won the victory in the struggle and completed the wheat sowing task as scheduled. Zhao Da, Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, said after inspecting their work: "The operation quality meets agricultural requirements and has laid a good foundation for a bumper harvest."
    One evening after dinner, I went to the farm club to watch the workers rehearse a play. The tall club was brightly lit by electric lights, and the room was crowded with people. Over here, a group of people were practicing singing around the reed organ, and over there, a group of people were learning the red silk dance. In the crowd rehearsing the opera "Zhao Xiaolan," I saw Liu Shuxin. Her situation now is completely different from that in the fields. Her clothes are neat and fit, and her beautiful face is glowing with healthy radiance. She is only twenty years old and is the daughter of a long-term worker. During the intense wheat sowing operation, she and another female tractor driver, a Mongolian girl named Sa Ren, created the record of sowing 4.63 hectares per hour almost simultaneously, exceeding the efficiency standard of the farm's competition with mechanical farms across the country by more than 13 percent.
    It is impossible and unnecessary to report on all aspects of the patriotic production increase movement of the Chahayang Farm one by one. Every corner is boiling with patriotic labor enthusiasm, and everyone is contributing their wisdom and strength in their own positions. Although the car driver Lao Liang is more than fifty years old, he is more anxious to work than the young lads. When transporting excellent Soviet wheat seeds from Qiqihar to the farm, he transports more than 6,000 catties at a time, exceeding the load by one-third. Asked why he did this? He said, "Increase production and conservation!" The master chefs in the kitchen also participated in the patriotic production increase movement. They assured the workers that they would not only make the food delicious, but also ensure that there would be hot food and boiled water at all times.
    On the morning I left the farm, Deputy Director Zhao Da clearly told me about the farm's bumper harvest movement. He was originally the farm director and was only recently transferred to Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture. This time, he came to the farm to inspect the spring耕作 work. He said that the conditions for the farm to achieve a bumper harvest this year are, first, the land is well prepared. Crops grow on the ground, and good ground will inevitably lead to strong crops. Second, the seeds have all been carefully selected and disinfected, and more than one-third of them are excellent varieties that have been cultivated for many years. Third, universal and large-scale fertilization, which did not exist in previous years. "Finally, and most importantly," Deputy Director Zhao said in a more emphatic tone, "is the high patriotic labor enthusiasm of all employees, which can create any production miracle."
    The patriotism labor of the working class can create any production miracle. I saw that the patriotic production increase plans of each work zone greatly exceeded the goal of increasing production and saving 5 million catties of rice proposed by the general farm, and the actual labor of the employees greatly exceeded their own plans. All the employees of the Chahayang Farm have created many production miracles, and they are still creating new miracles. While we were talking, a loud singing voice came from the field:
    "The tractor and we sing together,
    The Great Northern Wilderness has changed its old appearance.
    The green paddy fields, the golden wheat waves;
    The beautiful orchards, the herds of cattle and sheep,
    Happiness is flourishing here,
    Our labor is more pleasant,
    We must change the whole of China to be beautiful and prosperous."

    在每一单位面积上争取高额产量
    ——记查哈阳农场的爱国丰产运动
    本报记者　田流
    春耕季节访问查哈阳农场，使人格外兴奋。拖拉机吼叫着在原野上耕耘；汽车一辆紧跟一辆，往田里运送种子和肥料；水利工程处的工人挥舞着两条有力的臂膀，不知疲倦地修筑着新的灌溉渠道。到处是紧张的劳动，到处是快乐的歌声。
    查哈阳农场在大兴安岭东麓，嫩江西面的大平原上。它是黑龙江省最大的省营水旱田机械农场。现在，该场一千多职工，正为实现他们向全国各国营农场提出的爱国丰产竞赛条件而努力。他们说：
    “要使农场的每一块土地，都获得高额产量。”使水稻每公顷收获五千五百六十斤，小麦二千二百八十四斤，大豆二千九百四十四斤；比当地农民的产量高出百分之三十九、百分之六十三和百分之二十八。在北满的气候条件下，能够使三千三百二十公顷水稻，七百五十五公顷小麦和五百四十四公顷大豆，平均得到这样的高额产量，真是十分可喜的事情。但查哈阳农场的工人，并不以此为满足。他们说：除了完成国家的生产任务外，再增产节约五百万斤水稻，响应毛主席的号召，支持我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。”
        一个晴朗的日子，我去访问第四作业区。第四作业区共有一千一百公顷土地，都是水田。除了三十公顷土地用轮作法种植大豆和牧草外，全部耕地都种水稻。查哈阳农场为了更好地担负起国营农场在生产上的示范作用，在农场经营的各种作物中，都划出了示范区。农场的二百公顷水稻示范田就在第四作业区里。这二百公顷示范水稻，每公顷要达到八千到一万斤的高额产量，比当地农民的产量高一倍到一倍半。
    第四作业区是王士林机耕队负责耕作的。
    王士林是个雇农的儿子，一九四八年成立农场时，到农场来学拖拉机。一九五○年，他运用苏联的先进经验，实行拖拉机牵引多台农具机的联结作业，创造了一天耙地一百二十七点六九公顷的纪录，超过国家的效率定额百分之五十；燃料消耗也降低了百分之五十。一九五一年播种小麦时，又超过国家定额百分之三十九，创造了日播九十六公顷的新纪录。因为他在生产上有巨大成就，被选为黑龙江省的特等劳动模范。今年，他升任为第四作业区的机耕队长。
    王士林当了队长，还是离不开他那心爱的拖拉机。他从早到晚成天价在田里奔波巡视，从这个机耕小队走到那个机耕小队，从这台拖拉机爬上那台拖拉机，检查和指示工作。为了帮助队员们更快地掌握技术，他常常跳上拖拉机，亲自操作一阵，给新手们示范。王士林是第四作业区的青年团书记。他对团员们的教育和团的群众工作非常重视，检查工作时，总要给大家读报讲时事。四月十四日到二十日，接连下了几天大雨雪，拖拉机不能下地耕作。他就利用这个机会，白天领导各小队学习操作规程和检查爱国公约，晚上发动大家开娱乐晚会。队员们在他的领导下，劳动得又紧张又快乐。
    北满天气很冷。全年只有一百二十天无霜期。水稻的生长期也是一百二十天。因此必须适时播种。稍一迟延，水稻便会因生长期不足而歉收。王士林拖拉机队为了夺取时间，搬到田里去住，免得往返走路，耽误时间。田里没有房子，就搭起临时窝棚。夜里天气冷，人们在潮湿的窝棚里冻得直打颤，但是没有一个人说难道苦的。为了夺取时间，他们日夜工作。夜间耙地是很困难的，最容易重复和遗漏。重复则浪费工作时间和油料；遗漏则影响工作质量，将来庄稼长不好。胡继业小队的拖拉机上没有灯，工作起来更是困难。可是队员们说：“季节不等人，没灯咱也干”，助手挥着白手巾在头前引路，驾驶员看着前面的人影前进。后半夜天气冷起来，“泛浆”的泥土沾在耙片上，不大一会就冻住了，这种情况严重地影响了作业效率。耙出来的地，质量也不好。寇文元小队的拖拉机助手、青年团员史金生，用手把沾在耙片上的泥土扣下来，给驾驶员创造出顺利的工作条件。第二天夜里，他带着一根小铁棍，用铁棍打掉耙片上的泥土。爱国丰产运动中谁肯落后呢？史金生创造性的劳动，立时在全队传播开来，很快成为每个人的实际行动。
    王士林机耕队就是这样地工作着。他们不仅战胜了自然界给予的困难，如期完成了春季耙地工作，给及时播种创造了条件，而且在作业中创造了新的工作方法。农场技术指导室根据土地的状况，计划耙六遍才能达到农业上的要求。王士林机耕队员们发挥了创造性，加重耙具机的重量，并在耙具后面带上“拖子”。这样，耙四遍就达到了六遍的质量，不仅节省了那两遍的机器磨损和人工，争取了时间，还节省了那两遍的油料。王士林同志说：“这只是开始，以后在播种、收割、耕地……中，都要想尽一切办法，提高效率，节省燃料，全年要为国家节省四万斤柴油。”这只是第四作业区增产节约的一个角落的情况。在全作业区，机耕队有机耕队的增产节约计划，农工队有农工队的增产节约计划，集体有集体的计划，个人有个人的计划。全作业区准备从提高单位面积产量上，增产一百六十余万斤水稻，连上其他方面的增产和节约，今年共为国家创造二百三十万斤水稻的超计划财富。
    “我们是一群勇敢的姑娘，
        都有建设祖国的远大理想……
        从翻身的农村……来到这祖国的边疆。
        组成新中国第一个女拖拉机队，
        梁军就是我们的队长。”
    这是梁军女拖拉机队年青的队员们唱的歌，她们正驾驶着自己的“钢马”，在春天的田野上紧张地播种小麦。今年第一作业区播种小麦的面积，占全场小麦面积一半还多。在北满，在大面积上播种小麦，是一场紧张的斗争。北满常是春旱秋涝，正当种子发芽生长、需要水分的时候，天旱地干；在麦子成熟的收割季节，又常常碰到连绵的阴雨。这种自然灾害，对于大面积作业的危害特别严重。一九五一年，农场的一千六百多公顷麦子，虽然长的都很好，但麦收前后一连落了六十多天雨。机器下不了地，这样大面积用人工收割，那能来得及呢？结果，许多麦子没有收回来，“丰产了但是没有丰收”。要获得丰收，就必须实行新的耕作法——提前播种。这样，便可利用溶雪的水分，使种子顺利发芽，以便提前成熟期，躲开阴雨的危害。因此，春季的小麦播种作业，便成了一件非常紧张的战斗作业，要充分发挥每个人的劳动热情与智慧，要充分发挥机械的效能。和时间竞赛并战胜时间，才能获得丰收。梁军女拖拉机队在斗争中获得了胜利，如期地完成了播麦任务。黑龙江省农业厅赵达副厅长检查了她们的工作以后说：“作业质量合乎农业要求，给丰产打下了良好基础。”
    一天晚饭后，我到农场俱乐部去看工人们排戏，高大的俱乐部被电灯照得雪亮，屋里挤满了人。这边一群人围着风琴练习唱歌，那边一群人学习红绸舞。在彩排歌剧“赵小兰”的人群中，我看到了刘淑新。她现在的情形，和在田野上完全不同了。她的衣服整洁合体，秀丽的脸上泛着健康的红光。她才二十岁，是个长工的女儿。她在紧张的播麦作业中，同另一位女拖拉机手，名叫萨仁的蒙族姑娘，差不多同时地创造了每小时播种四点六三公顷的纪录，超过农场向全国各机械农场竞赛的效率标准百分之十三以上。
    要想把查哈阳农场的爱国丰产运动的各方面，一一加以报道，这是不可能，也不必要的。每个角落都沸腾着爱国主义的劳动热潮，每一个人都在自己的岗位上，贡献着自己的智慧和力量。汽车司机老梁，虽已五十多岁，干起工作来，比年青的小伙子还急性。从齐齐哈尔往农场运输苏联优良麦种时，一次就运六千多斤，超过负荷三分之一。问他为什么这样干？他说：“增产节约啊！”伙房的大师傅也参加到爱国丰产运动中来了，他们向工人保证：不但要把饭菜作好，还要保证随时都有热饭和开水。
    离开农场的那天早晨，赵达副厅长条理清楚地向我谈起农场丰产运动。他原是农场场长，不久前才调任黑龙江省农业厅副厅长，这次是来农场检查春耕工作的。他说，农场今年取得丰产的条件，第一是地整的好。庄稼是在地上长的，地好必然庄稼壮。第二是种子都经过精选和消毒，并且有三分之一以上是经过多年培育的优良品种。第三，普遍大量施肥，这是往年没有的。“最后，也是最重要的”，赵副厅长加重语气说：“是全体职工高度的爱国主义劳动热情，它可以创造出任何生产奇迹。”
    工人阶级的爱国主义劳动，可以创造出任何生产奇迹。我看到各个作业区的爱国增产计划，极大地超过总场提出的增产节约五百万斤水稻的目标，而职工的劳动实际，又极大地超越了自己的计划。查哈阳农场全体职工，已经创造出不少生产奇迹，还正在创造着新的奇迹。我们正在谈话的时候，田野上传来嘹亮的歌声：
    “拖拉机和我们一同歌唱，
    北大荒改变了旧日的模样。
    那碧绿的稻田，那金色的麦浪；
    那美丽的果园，那成群的牛羊，
    幸福在这里蓬勃生长，
    我们的劳动更愉快，
    要把全中国都改变得美丽富强。”
