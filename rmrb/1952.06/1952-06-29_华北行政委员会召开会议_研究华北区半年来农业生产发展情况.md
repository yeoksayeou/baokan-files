Xinhua News Agency, June 28th—The North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council convened a meeting on June 18th to study the development of agricultural production in the North China region over the past six months. Director Liu Lantao also gave clear instructions on future work.

    The information gathered at the meeting revealed that due to the in-depth development of the patriotic production increase competition movement in rural areas, the achievements made in agricultural production in the North China region in the past six months far exceeded any previous year. The agricultural planting in various regions was generally carried out according to the original plan, and a bumper wheat harvest was achieved, with the yield per unit area exceeding the original plan by about 10 percent. Various regions have been able to quickly and effectively organize forces to eradicate insect pests. Digging wells and opening canals have become a mass movement. The total area of ​​paddy fields expanded in the past six months is approximately equivalent to one-third of the total area of ​​paddy fields in the past, exceeding the planned target by 36 percent. The state has also systematically strengthened its support for agriculture, promoting more than 66,000 new agricultural tools and machinery, and selling more than 600 million jin of various refined fertilizers. The blindness of farmers in production during the process of completing national production plans has been further overcome. The planting areas of cash crops such as cotton, sunflowers, and flax in Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Chahar provinces have all been completed according to the state-controlled planned figures.

    The work in the past six months has proved that the patriotic production increase competition movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation is the best way to organize and promote farmers to complete their production increase plans. The competition movement was very unbalanced in the early stages when Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli and others initiated the joint challenge competition. After local leading organs transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to inspect and help, the movement gradually became widespread. Mutual aid teams have been further consolidated and greatly developed in the competition movement. Among the 330,000 mutual aid teams of different types in Shanxi Province, 150,000 were developed during the competition movement. With the goals and plans for the competition, the mutual aid teams have greatly changed the past laissez-faire state in some areas. Mutual aid teams have actively demanded that cadres strengthen their leadership. The competition movement has also prompted farmers to invest heavily in land, changing the past mentality of simply relying on state loans. According to incomplete data, this year the total investment of farmers in Hebei Province in waterwheels and wells alone has reached 200 billion yuan. In the past, the promotion and seed soaking and mixing of improved varieties had to be completed by government personnel going door-to-door to mobilize and persuade. This year, some farmers had preserved improved varieties that the leadership had not yet discovered and were exchanged by everyone. In some old areas of Shanxi, 100 percent of farmers have implemented seed soaking, and Chahar has also reached 80 percent.

    At the meeting, Director Liu Lantao pointed out that the leadership must focus on the following three things in the future: First, continue to strengthen the leadership of the patriotic production increase competition movement, and not be satisfied with the existing achievements. From now until the beginning of autumn, a comparison movement centered on fertilizer accumulation, seedling cultivation, weeding, and top dressing should be carried out (the focus can be determined according to local conditions). At all levels, there should be special personnel in charge of the judging of the competition, and the evaluation and observation movement that has been launched in rural areas should be developed with leadership, so that it can play a greater role in exchanging experiences. The evaluation movement is an important method to promote science and technology, constantly encourage farmers' enthusiasm, and enable the competition movement to continue to develop. Local leading cadres should give it sufficient attention. The second is to strengthen the leadership of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. The mutual assistance and cooperation policy is the country's basic policy in rural areas, and it must be actively and correctly implemented. Some phenomena of coercion and command that have arisen in the rapid and rapid development must be corrected in a timely manner. Strengthen the political leadership of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, so that farmers can gradually understand the benefits of mutual assistance and cooperation from their own personal experience, and understand the inseparability of individual interests, collective interests, and national interests. Third, in the case that the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for increasing production has been encouraged, technical guidance is more important than in the past. It is necessary to give full play to the leading role of state farms, prepare to supply a large number of new agricultural tools and machinery and medicines, train a large number of agricultural technicians, continue to mobilize the masses to study agricultural technology, and further promote advanced experience in agricultural production, so that scientific agricultural technology can be gradually mastered by the vast number of farmers.

    Regarding the interrelationship between industrial and agricultural production, Liu Lantao emphasized the position of agricultural production in the current work. He said: We cannot neglect and relax the leadership of agricultural production because the current focus of leadership has shifted to industrial production. The importance of industrial production is because it is the decisive link in transforming our country's economy from backward to advanced. The development and improvement of agriculture must rely on industry to supply a large number of machines and implement agricultural mechanization. All of this is impossible without the development of industry. But this does not mean that agricultural production is not important at present. The status of agricultural production cannot be reduced because of the importance of the industrial status. On the contrary, it becomes more important with the development of industry. Industrial development is also impossible without the support of agriculture, because the countryside is the main market for industry. The supply of grain and industrial raw materials is becoming increasingly important with the development of industry. The leadership must clearly recognize this issue, otherwise, mistakes will be made. Strengthening the leadership of agricultural production must also pay attention to planning. Strengthening agricultural production plans will directly guarantee the smooth implementation of the country's industrial construction plans. It is a great victory that this year's agricultural production in North China can be carried out largely according to the original plan. In the future, we not only need a production plan for the current year, but also need to formulate a longer-term plan, which is an indispensable link in welcoming the country's planned large-scale construction.

    Finally, in view of the drought situation in North China, Liu Lantao asked everyone to be vigilant against the threat of drought as early as possible, and never be careless. We must give full play to the rich experience accumulated by the people of North China in fighting drought over the years, and the leadership must comprehensively promote these experiences.

    华北行政委员会召开会议
    研究华北区半年来农业生产发展情况
     【新华社二十八日讯】政务院华北行政委员会于六月十八日召开会议，研究了华北区半年来农业生产发展情况，刘澜涛主任并对今后工作做了明确的指示。
    从会议上所集中的情况看出：由于爱国增产竞赛运动在农村的深入开展，华北区半年来在农业生产上所获得的成就远超过以往任何一年。各地农业种植大体都是按照原订计划进行，小麦已获得丰收，单位面积产量超过原计划约百分之十；各地对于虫害已能迅速有效地组织力量予以扑灭；打井开渠成为群众性的运动，半年来水田扩大的总数约相等于过去水田总数的三分之一，超过预定计划百分之三十六；国家并有计划地加强了对农业的支援，推广各种新式农具、农械六万六千余部，推销各种细肥六亿余斤。进一步克服了农民在完成国家生产计划过程中在生产上的盲目性，河北、山西、平原、察哈尔等省棉花、葵花、胡麻等经济作物种植面积，都按国家控制的计划数字完成。
    半年来的工作，证明了以互助合作为中心的爱国增产竞赛运动，是组织与推动农民完成增产计划的最好形式。竞赛运动在李顺达、曲耀离等人发起联合挑战竞赛的初期是很不平衡的，当各地领导机关抽调大批干部下乡检查帮助以后，这个运动就逐渐普遍了。互助组在竞赛运动中进一步巩固并且有很大发展。山西省三十三万个不同类型的互助组中有十五万个是在竞赛运动中发展的。互助组有了竞赛的目标与计划，大大改变了已往若干地区的自流状态。互助组都积极要求干部加强对他们的领导。竞赛运动并促使农民对土地进行大量投资，改变了过去那种单纯依赖国家贷款的情绪。据不完全材料，今年河北省农民仅水车、水井两项投资的总数已达两千亿元。良种的推广和浸种、拌种，过去要经过政府工作人员挨户动员说服才能完成，今年有些农户保存的良种，领导方面还没有发现，就被大家换完了。实行浸种的农户，山西一部分老区已达百分之百，察哈尔也已达到百分之八十。
    会上，刘澜涛主任指出今后领导上必须抓住以下三件事：第一是继续加强对爱国增产竞赛运动的领导，不可满足于已有的成绩。从现在起到立秋前要开展一个以积肥、锄苗、除草、施追肥为中心的评比运动（以何为主，可依当地具体情况确定）。各级要有专人掌握竞赛的评判工作，要有领导地发展农村已经开展起来的评比观摩运动，使其在交流经验方面发生更大的作用。评比运动是推广科学技术，不断地鼓舞农民热情、使竞赛运动能够持续发展的
    一个重要方法，各地领导干部应予以足够的重视。第二是加强对于互助合作运动的领导。互助合作政策是国家在农村中的基本政策，必须积极正确地贯彻实施。在猛烈飞速发展中所产生的一些强迫命令现象，必须及时加以纠正。加强对互助组与农业生产合作社的政治领导，使农民能从自己的切身经验中逐步体会到互助合作的好处，懂得个人利益与集体利益、国家利益的不可分离性。第三，在广大农民增产热情已被鼓舞起来的情形下，技术指导显得比过去更加重要，要充分发挥国家农场的领导作用，要准备供应大量的新式农具和药械，训练大批的农业技术人材，继续发动群众研究农业技术，进一步推广农业生产的先进经验；使科学的农业技术逐渐为广大农民所掌握。
    关于工农业生产的相互关系问题，刘澜涛着重指出农业生产在目前工作中的位置。他说：不能因为目前领导重点转向工业生产而忽视与放松农业生产的领导。工业生产的重要，是因为它是我们国家经济由落后变为先进的决定环节，农业的发展与改进，必须依靠工业供给大量的机器，实行农业机械化，而这一切如果离开工业的发展是不可能的。但这并不是说目前农业生产就不重要了，农业生产的地位不仅不能因为工业地位的重要而减轻，相反的，它随工业的发展，也显得更加重要了。工业没有农业的支援也是不可能发展起来的，因为农村是工业的主要市场。粮食、工业原料的供给随着工业的发展愈益重要。领导方面必须清醒地认识这个问题，否则就要犯错误。加强农业生产的领导，也必须注意计划性，农业生产计划的加强，将直接保证国家工业建设计划的顺利进行。华北今年的农业生产，能大体按照原定计划进行是一个很大的胜利。今后我们不仅需要有一个当年的生产计划，而且还要制定一个较长远的计划，这是迎接祖国有计划的大规模的建设所不能缺少的环节。
    最后，刘澜涛针对华北区干旱情况，要求大家及早警惕旱灾的威胁，决不可麻痹大意，要充分发扬华北人民在与干旱作斗争方面历年所积累起来的丰富的经验；领导方面要全面地推广这些经验。
