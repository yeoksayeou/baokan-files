The Beijing Municipal Factory Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition Movement Office
Calls for Preparations for Launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement

The state-owned factories and mines in Beijing will universally launch a patriotic increase production and practice economy competition movement in mid-June. In order to ensure that this movement is carried out in a planned and organized manner, the Beijing Municipal Factory Increase Production and Practice Economy Competition Movement Office requires all factories and mines to seize the time and make preparations. The preparations are as follows:

First, it is necessary to formulate an increase production and practice economy competition plan. The plan should include an increase production and practice economy plan and a production competition plan. All factories and mines should, based on the completion of the plan in the first five months of this year, propose specific goals for surpassing the state plan in terms of output, quality, and cost for the enterprise and each workshop this year, and revise the 1952 increase production and practice economy plan formulated at the end of last year. In order to guarantee the completion of this increase production and practice economy plan, a practical production competition plan should be formulated, clarifying which key problems (such as output, quality, cost, scrap rate, etc.) need to be solved in this competition movement, and how to solve these key problems; which advanced production experiences and advanced working methods should be promoted, and how to promote them, etc.

Second, adjust the organization and supplement cadres. Inappropriate organizations should be adjusted quickly, and cadres who have collapsed or been transferred in the "Three-Anti" campaign should be supplemented quickly.

Third, prepare a plan for the supply of raw materials and a plan for improving labor conditions. The material supply plan includes purchasing, transportation, and inventory inspection, and must ensure timely supply; study various labor conditions, especially the ventilation and safety equipment of the workshops, and make specific improvement plans.

Fourth, the main wastes in all aspects must be checked out (units with less urgent production tasks can set aside a period of time to carry out an anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy movement), and necessary systems must be established. In conjunction with the materials and problems exposed in the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, leading cadres should conduct sincere and profound self-criticism of their own bureaucracy and mobilize employees to discuss.

Fifth, summarize advanced production experiences and cultivate typical examples. There have been many new advanced production experiences, advanced working methods, inventions, and new records in various units, departments, types of work, and aspects. They should be immediately summarized, and model banners (groups, individuals, workshops) should be established and cultivated, and specific promotion steps and goals should be formulated, and vigorously publicized and promoted.

Sixth, in conjunction with the discussion of the increase production and practice economy plan, conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization, call on employees to work hard to study production, find tricks, and improve the increase production and practice economy plan. Mobilize various forces to engage in the propaganda of the increase production competition, and encourage employees' enthusiasm for competition through employee representative meetings, large lectures, revision of patriotic pacts, and holding exhibitions.

    北京市工厂增产节约竞赛运动办公室
    号召做好开展增产节约运动的准备工作
    北京市国营厂矿将在六月中旬普遍开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动。为使这一运动有计划有组织地开展起来，北京市工厂增产节约竞赛运动办公室，要求各厂矿企业抓紧时间做好准备工作。准备工作如下：
    第一、要制订增产节约竞赛计划。计划内容包括增产节约计划和生产竞赛计划。各厂矿企业应根据今年前五个月完成计划的情况，提出本企业和各车间今年在产量、质量及成本上超过国家计划的具体奋斗目标，修订去年年底所制订的一九五二年增产节约计划。为了保证这个增产节约计划的完成，应该制订切合实际的生产竞赛计划，并明确这次竞赛运动要解决那些关键问题（如产量、质量、成本、废品率等），怎样解决这些关键问题；要推广那些先进生产经验与先进工作方法，怎样推广等等。
    第二、调整机构，补充干部。不适当的机构要迅速调整，在“三反”中垮了的和被调动了的干部应迅速补充。
    第三、做好原材料供应计划及改进劳动条件的计划。材料供应计划包括购买、运到和检查库存等方面，务必保证供应及时；研究各种劳动条件，特别是场房通风安全设备的情况，并做出具体的改进计划。
    第四、把各方面主要的浪费要检查出来（生产任务不甚紧迫的单位，可划出一段时间开展反浪费反官僚主义运动），必要的制度要建立起来。结合反贪污、反浪费运动所揭发出来的材料与问题，领导干部要对自己的官僚主义进行诚恳而深刻的检讨，并发动职工讨论。
    第五、总结先进生产经验，培养典型。各单位各部门、各工种、各方面曾有不少新的先进生产经验、先进工作方法、创造发明、新纪录，应立即加以总结，树立并培养模范旗帜（小组、个人、车间），并订出具体的推广步骤和目标，大力宣传和推广。
    第六、结合讨论增产节约计划，深入进行宣传动员，号召职工努力钻研生产、找窍门，提高增产节约计划。动员各种力量从事增产竞赛的宣传，通过职工代表会议、上大课、修订爱国公约、举办展览会等方式鼓动职工竞赛热情。
