Strengthen this year's summer grain requisition and storage work
Liang Zhuhang, Director of the General Administration of Grain Management, Central Ministry of Finance

The summer grain requisition work of 1952 is about to begin. In order to do a good job in the storage of summer grain requisition this year, the General Administration of Grain Management of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Finance recently issued "Instructions on the Grain Storage Work of Summer Requisition in 1952," requiring all regions to carry forward past experience and further strengthen the planning and organization of this year's summer grain requisition and storage work. Grain departments at all levels should earnestly and conscientiously implement these instructions and do a good job in this year's summer grain requisition and storage work.

Reasonably stipulating the grain quality standards for public grain is the main link in doing a good job in the requisition work. In this regard, there was significant progress in 1951 compared to 1950. In 1951, most regions generally implemented the principle of "dry, clean, and full," which greatly improved the quality of public grain. This was due, on the one hand, to the generally increased awareness of the masses; on the other hand, it was due to the relatively careful inspection of the quality of public grain by requisition personnel, and the creation of several better inspection methods. Last year, some regions implemented the methods of "inspecting each household," "inspecting each village," and "inspecting at the warehouse"; some regions also mobilized the masses to compare and evaluate each other before collective grain delivery, and bad grain was rectified or replaced at any time; some regions implemented the method of letting the masses inspect samples first, so that the masses could understand the quality and standards that public grain should have. In order to appraise grain quality, some regions have begun to adopt a combination of various sensory appraisals and scientific instrument corrections. These methods have achieved great results, and the masses are also very satisfied, proving that they can be promoted. This year, all regions must consolidate these achievements, continue to implement the principle of "dry, clean, and full," and maintain last year's moisture standard for public grain. The public grain stored this year should be based on the local average or above average grain of this year. As far as possible, the dust, mustard, ash, and other impurities should not exceed 0.5 percent. All regions must set aside a certain amount of time to centrally train grain quality appraisal personnel, so that they can master the technology skillfully and correctly grasp the quality of grain stored.

Last year, various regions created many experiences in the handover, transportation, and allocation of public grain. Among them, there are three relatively mature experiences that can be promoted. First, sign collective storage contracts. Last year, Henan Province and other regions promoted this method and achieved results. This kind of collective storage contract is generally agreed upon and signed by the grain receiving department and the township and district governments. Its main spirit is to stipulate the quality of the stored public grain, the date of handover, the location of handover, the quantity, and the obligations that both parties should fulfill through the form of a contract. The grain delivery side guarantees to deliver the grain to the warehouse in an organized and orderly manner in accordance with the provisions of the contract; the grain receiving side guarantees to receive the grain delivered in accordance with the provisions of the contract on the same day, so that the masses do not have to wait, and to provide the grain delivery masses with necessary and appropriate hospitality, and to treat their acute illnesses. Second, the method of requisitioning and hiring transportation. According to national regulations, transporting public grain to the warehouse as a public service is the duty of the people. Based on this spirit, Pingyuan Province created the method of requisitioning and hiring transportation. This method does not directly require the masses to transport the grain themselves, but requires the masses to pay a portion of transportation grain (generally 2.15 percent of the burden amount, but the actual expenditure in various regions has a surplus) when paying public grain, and the government hires people to transport it. In this way, on the one hand, the burden on the masses is balanced, achieving the goal of those with money contributing money, and those with strength contributing strength, and eliminating the serious phenomenon of the old, weak, and livestock participating in transportation, resulting in casualties; on the other hand, because the method of transportation based on labor is implemented, the enthusiasm of the masses for transportation is greatly stimulated, and manpower and animal power are saved. Third, combine requisition and storage, and transfer trade grain in one go. The implementation of this method saves the time of handover and the manpower of handover, and saves a lot of expenses for the country. Now some regional grain bureaus and grain companies have already implemented joint offices, which makes the implementation of this method even more convenient.

In order to strengthen the storage of public grain, all regions must, based on actual conditions, plan for merging warehouses as early as possible, and generally inspect and repair existing warehouses. Disinfection should be carried out before public grain is stored. Larger centralized warehouses, transit dispatch warehouses, and warehouses that are prepared for long-term storage or have been infested with insects must be thoroughly disinfected with chemicals; smaller rural warehouses and warehouses that have not been infested with insects should also be coated with thick lime water on doors, windows, walls, floors, etc. All regions should organize grain cleaning and disinfection work teams in a timely manner to patrol and disinfect, so as to create good storage conditions for the summer grain requisition that is about to be stored.

### 加强今年夏征公粮入库工作

    加强今年夏征公粮入库工作
    中央财政部粮食管理总局局长  梁竹航
    一九五二年的夏征工作即将开始。为了作好今年夏征公粮的入库工作，中央人民政府财政部粮食管理总局最近发出“关于一九五二年夏征入库工作的指示”，要求各地发扬过去的经验，进一步加强今年夏征入库工作的计划性和组织性。各级粮食部门，应该切实、认真地执行这一指示，把今年夏征公粮入库工作作好。
    合理地规定公粮粮质的标准，是作好征收工作的主要环节。在这一方面，一九五一年较一九五零年有了显著的进步。一九五一年各地一般地执行了“干、净、饱”的方针，使公粮质量大为提高。这一方面是由于群众觉悟程度普遍提高；另一方面是由于征粮人员对公粮粮质实行了比较认真的检查，并创造了若干较好的检查方法。去年有些地区，曾实行了“逐户检查”“逐村检查”和“就库检查”的办法；有些地区并在集体送粮前，发动群众互相评比，发现有坏粮，随时整治或调换；有些地区实行了先让群众验看样品的方法，使群众了解公粮应有的质量和标准。为了鉴定粮质，有些地区已开始采用各种感官鉴定和科学仪器校正相结合的方法。这些办法，收到了很大的效果，群众也很满意，证明是可以推广的。今年各地必须巩固这些成绩，继续执行“干、净、饱”的方针，并保持去年的公粮水分标准。今年入库公粮，应以当地今年中等以上的粮食为标准，在可能范围内，不使尘、芥、灰、杂超过百分之点五。各地必须抽出一定的时间，集中训练粮食品质鉴定人员，使之熟练技术，正确地掌握入库粮质。
    去年各地创造了许多公粮交接、运输和调拨的经验。其中有三个比较成熟的经验，是可以加以推广的。一、订立集体入库合同。去年河南省及其他某些地区，都推行了这个办法，并获得了成绩。这种集体入库合同，一般是由接粮部门和乡、区政府协议订定的。其主要精神是把入库公粮的质量、交接日期、交接地点、数量及双方应尽的义务，通过合同的形式订定下来。交粮方面保证按照合同的规定，有组织、有秩序地把粮食送到仓库；接粮方面则保证把按照合同规定送到的粮食，在当日接收完毕，不使群众等待，并给送粮群众以必要和适当的招待，救治其急发的疾病。二、征雇运输办法。按照国家规定，义运公粮入库是人民应尽的职责。根据这一精神，去年平原省创造了征雇运输办法。这种办法是不直接由群众自行运输，而由群众在缴纳公粮时，附带缴纳一部分运费粮（一般为负担额的百分之二点一五，但各地实际开支均有结余），由政府雇人输送。这样一方面平衡了群众的负担，达到有钱出钱，有力出力，杜绝了以往老弱人畜参加运输，以致发生人畜伤亡的严重现象；另一方面，因为实行了按劳给资的运输办法，大大刺激了群众运输的积极性，节省了人力畜力。三、结合征收入库，一次拨交贸易粮。实行这种方法，节省了交接的时间和交接的人力，给国家节省了大量的开支。现在有的地区的粮食局和粮食公司已经实行联合办公，对于这一办法的执行就更加便利。
    为了加强公粮保管工作，各地必须根据实际情况，及早计划并仓，并普遍检查和修补现有仓库。公粮入库前，要进行消毒工作。较大的集中仓库，转运调度仓库，以及准备长期保管或生过虫的仓库，均须用药剂彻底消毒；农村较小的仓库和没有生过虫的仓库，也要用浓石灰水涂刷门窗、墙壁、地板等。各地区要及时组织清仓消毒工作队，巡回消毒，以便为即将入库的夏征公粮，创造良好的保管条件。
