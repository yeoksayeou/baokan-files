    "Tiger Flower" Can Kill Rice Seedling Pests
    Editor: "Tiger flower" is a kind of poisonous flower that grows on the mountains, about two and a half feet tall, with oval, green leaves and butterfly-shaped petals with slender stamens in the middle. This flower blooms in March and withers by May at the latest. The person who discovered that this flower has insecticidal properties was an old woman from Yangqiubu Township, Eighth District, Lingling County, Hunan Province. She puts the flower (the root has the same effect) in a pot, boils it with water, and then adds some soap (soap contains caustic soda). After the water cools, she removes the residue, fills a watering can or dips a broom in it, and sprays the rice seedlings. The insects die from the poison in just fifteen minutes. This potion can kill pests on pumpkin, cucumber, and cowpea seedlings. This old woman has been using "tiger flowers" to control insects for several years, and the results have been very good. It was only when the whole township discussed pest control methods this time that the old woman revealed this method. After experimentation, it has been proven that this flower does have insecticidal effects. We are willing to introduce this insect control method.

### “老虎花”能杀除秧苗害虫

    “老虎花”能杀除秧苗害虫
    编辑同志：“老虎花”是生在山上的一种毒花，高约二尺五寸，叶呈楕圆形，绿色，花瓣状如蝴蝶，中间有细长的花蕊。这种花在三月间开放，最迟到五月间凋谢。发现这种花有治虫效能的是湖南零陵县八区秧丘埠乡的一位老婆婆。她把花（花根也有同样作用）放在锅里，用水煮沸，再放入一些肥皂（肥皂含火碱）。等水冷了，除掉渣滓，用喷壶盛上，或用扫帚醮上，喷洒秧苗。只十五分钟，虫就受毒而死。这种药水，能杀除南瓜秧、黄瓜秧、豆角秧上的害虫。这位老婆婆使用“老虎花”治虫已有几年了，效果都很好。这回全乡群众讨论除虫办法时，老婆婆才把这个办法说出来。经过实验，证明这种花确实有杀虫功效。我们愿意把这个治虫办法介绍出来。
