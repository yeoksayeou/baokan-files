Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The National Cooperative Headquarters convened a national cooperative fertilizer supply meeting in Beijing from June 2nd to 8th, to review the implementation of the base fertilizer supply for spring planting and the annual fertilizer supply plan, and to arrange the task of supplying topdressing fertilizer for summer. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and relevant central government agencies, a total of twenty-seven people, from major regions such as East China, North China, Central South, Southwest, Northwest, and provinces such as Shandong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, Guangdong, and Shaanxi, attended the meeting.

The work of supplying base fertilizer for spring plowing and sowing to farmers nationwide by cooperatives this year has basically concluded. The majority of vegetable oil cake and chemical fertilizers required by farmers for spring plowing, excluding soil fertilizer, are the responsibility of the cooperatives to supply. By the end of May, cooperatives at all levels across the country had sold a total of 1.3 billion jin of vegetable oil cake, equivalent to 245% of the same period last year. As a result of vigorously educating farmers on the use of chemical fertilizers, the sales volume of chemical fertilizers has greatly increased, reaching 120 million jin, equivalent to 537% of the same period last year.

The meeting reviewed the implementation of the annual fertilizer supply plans of cooperatives in various regions. According to the original plan, 4 billion jin of vegetable oil cake would be supplied throughout the year, accounting for more than 50% of the national demand of farmers. The purchase of chemical fertilizers has reached 600 million jin, with a total value of 3 trillion yuan, exceeding the national fertilizer loan of 1.5 trillion yuan by one time. Under favorable weather conditions, the above fertilizers can guarantee an increase of 10 billion jin of rice or 19 million dan of cotton.

The meeting studied in detail the summer topdressing fertilizer situation of farmers in various regions, and determined that selling large quantities of fertilizer and correctly implementing the fertilizer sales method are the central tasks of the cooperatives at present. The meeting pointed out that vegetable oil and chemical fertilizers are mainly used for summer topdressing. Because sufficient topdressing is the key to increasing fertilizer production throughout the year for farmers, the supply of summer topdressing accounts for about 60% to 70% of the annual fertilizer demand of farmers. Therefore, this meeting decided to vigorously carry out the summer fertilizer sales campaign in a planned way starting from mid-June, resolutely oppose the conservative idea of being reluctant to sell. In addition to planning to retain a certain amount as base fertilizer for autumn planting, the rest must be completely sold out during the summer topdressing season. However, sales must be directly to farmers who need fertilizer, and no wholesale to the market is allowed. The price policy should be correctly grasped, and the selling price should not be raised arbitrarily. For sales in old liberated areas, due to the higher purchasing power of farmers, cash sales should be the main method. For poor farmers in new areas and particularly poor farmers such as military families, revolutionary martyrs' families, and workers' families in old areas, implement "credit sales and ordering" (that is, credit fertilizer is given in summer, and their autumn products are ordered at the same time). In addition, the meeting emphasized and required all regions to continue to educate farmers on the application of chemical fertilizers, oppose the conservative thinking of some cadres who emphasize that "farmers are not used to it" and therefore do not actively promote it, in order to supplement the shortage of domestic oil cake. At the same time, it is stipulated that areas that do not produce soybean cake or have very little output should focus on promoting chemical fertilizers, combined with other plant fertilizers produced locally for mixed use. Encourage farmers to purchase fertilizer collectively, and establish combined contracts through "credit sales and ordering" and mutual aid groups.

In addition, the meeting made a resolution on the recovery of fertilizer loans: It must be made clear to farmers that the "spring loan, summer repayment" portion must be fully recovered in July and August; the "summer loan, autumn repayment" portion must be recovered before the end of November. If it is really impossible to repay on time due to crop failure or other reasons, formal procedures for "postponement of repayment" must be completed. And educate farmers to establish the idea of "having credit and repayment, maintaining credit." After the cooperative recovers the loan, it must return it to the bank on time, and must not misappropriate it without authorization, and thoroughly implement the principle of special funds for special use.

Specific arrangements were also made for formulating next year's fertilizer supply plan, and the overall task will be doubled compared to this year. At the same time, in order to reduce national loans, preparations are being made to launch a credit business of "saving in kind and pre-selling" by farmers after the autumn harvest, planning to absorb 2 trillion yuan of farmers' funds for fertilizer processing and procurement.

Finally, everyone unanimously believed that on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, it is necessary to strengthen the economic accounting system. In the national headquarters' transportation of 350,000 tons of fertilizer in the spring, a total of 200 billion yuan was saved due to the implementation of direct unloading and improved loading and unloading methods to reduce losses. This experience should be promoted throughout the country, and it was resolved to take the actual expenses, losses, and turnover of the first quarter as the base, reduce the cost by another 10%, and strive to overfulfill the task.

    全国合作总社在京召开肥料供应会议
    确定有计划地大力开展夏季销肥运动
    【新华社十三日讯】全国合作总社于六月二日至八日在北京召开了全国合作社肥料供应会议，检查春种底肥供应及全年肥料供应计划的执行情况，并布置夏季追肥供应任务。到会者有华东、华北、中南、西南、西北等大区和山东、浙江、河北、平原、河南、广东、陕西等省合作总社及中央有关机关代表共二十七人。
    今年合作社供应全国农民春耕播种施用的底肥工作，已基本结束；今年农民春耕所需底肥除土肥外，植物油饼及化学肥料绝大部分是由合作社负责供应的。到五月底止，全国各级合作社共销出植物油饼十三亿斤，相当于去年同期的百分之二四五；因为大力教育农民使用化学肥料的结果，大大提高了化学肥料的销售量，计达一亿二千万斤，相当于去年同期的百分之五三七。
    会议检查了各地合作社全年肥料供应计划的执行情况；按原计划全年供应植物油饼四十亿斤，约占全国农民需要量的百分之五十以上。订购化学肥料已达六亿斤，合计总值达三万亿元，超过国家一万五千亿肥料贷款的一倍。以上肥料，在风调雨顺的情况下，可保证增产一百亿斤稻谷，或一千九百万担棉花。
    会议详细研究了各地农民夏季追肥情况，并确定大量出售肥料及正确贯彻销肥办法是合作社当前的中心任务。会议指出植物油和化学肥料，主要用于夏季追肥。因为上足追肥，是农民全年施肥增产的关键，夏季追肥的供应约占农民全年需肥量的百分之六十到七十。因此，这次会议决定从六月中旬开始，有计划地大力开展夏季销肥运动，坚决反对保守惜售思想，各地除了计划保留一定数量作为秋种底肥外，其余的都必须于夏季追肥季节完全销出。但销售时必须直接售于需肥农民，不得向市场批发，并应正确掌握价格政策，不得随意抬高售价。对老区的销售，由于农民购买力较高，应以现售为主；对新区的贫苦农民及老区军、烈、工属等特别贫困的农户，实行“赊销订购”（即夏季赊给肥料，同时订购其秋季产品）。另外，会议强调要求各地继续教育农民施用化学肥料，反对某些干部强调“农民不习惯”因而不积极推广的保守思想，以补助国产油饼的不足。同时规定不产豆饼或产量很少的地区，应以推广化学肥料为主，结合当地生产之其他植物肥料搀合使用。鼓励农民集体购肥，并通过“赊销订购”和互助组订立结合合同。
    此外，会议对肥料贷款收回工作作出决议：与农民言明“春贷夏还”部分，须于七、八月份全部收回；“夏贷秋还”部分，须于十一月底前收回。如因歉收或其他原因，实在无法按期归还者，必须办理“延期归还”的正式手续。并教育农民建立“有赊有还，保持信用”的思想。合作社收回贷款后，必须按期归还银行，不得擅自挪用，彻底贯彻专款专用原则。
    关于制订明年供肥计划，也作了具体布置，总任务将超过今年一倍；同时为了减少国家贷款，准备于秋收后发动农民“存实预售”的信用业务，计划吸收农民资金二万亿元，用于肥料的加工与采购方面。
    最后大家一致认为在“三反”胜利的基础上，必须加强经济核算制，全国总社在春季三十五万吨的肥料调运中，由于贯彻了直达卸货，改善了装卸方法，减少损耗等共节约二百亿元，这一经验应推广全国，并决议以第一季的实际费用、损耗和周转为基数，将成本再降低百分之十，并争取超额完成。
