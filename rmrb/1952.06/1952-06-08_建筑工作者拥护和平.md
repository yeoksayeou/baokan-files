Construction Workers Support Peace
Liang Sicheng, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Architectural Society of China

Many cities in many countries were destroyed by the frenzied wars launched by the fascists during World War II and became ruins. The lives, property, cultural treasures, work and ideals of the people there were destroyed and tormented day and night by the terrible war fire for several years. Countless people lost the happiness of peaceful life. They had spared no effort to resist the invaders with all their spirit and their entire lives, defending their homes and homeland. They finally defeated the invaders and ended the war. The end of the war, which was exchanged for countless lives and tears, is so precious!

The last war ended, but in the years that followed, returning from the abyss of suffering to their destroyed homes, rebuilding houses, streets, factories, schools, nurseries, parks, libraries, hospitals... No one knows the arduousness and difficulty of this process better than our generation of workers, engineers and architects.

What a strange and undue contrast! While Stalingrad, Warsaw, democratic Germany's Berlin, Kiev, Budapest, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Guilin have been heroically rebuilt, and built more grandly and beautifully than before, not only are most of Rotterdam, Coventry, Cologne, Hiroshima, and Manila still in ruins, with no signs of reconstruction, but even the destroyed areas of London, which were not occupied by the enemy, have only had some rubble cleared away. Moreover, the beautiful historical city, Pyongyang, the ancient capital of Korea, and many towns with cultural relics were barbarously razed to the ground by "the most modern" and "most scientific" weapons! What is the reason for this? The reason is obvious. Today, the peaceful construction in many countries can proceed because it is the universal desire of the people and has received unanimous support from the whole country. The government and the people work together with the greatest strength and confidence. Conversely, in some other countries, the people's wishes are obliterated, and calls are stifled; war-mongers, for their own bloody greed, violate the most basic requirement of mankind - peaceful life - and concentrate their efforts to extort the people's blood and sweat to prepare for another war of aggression. It is the huge military budget that deprives the people of their income; it is the frantic military production that seizes the raw materials for daily consumer production and building materials. Therefore, many cities are left in ruins and cannot be repaired or rebuilt. Moreover, when the heinous war propaganda develops into provocation and "experimental" aggression, countless innocent young people are deceived to the battlefield to destroy other people's homelands.

Today, the facts are so clearly laid out before us: peace and war - one side is human happiness, the other side is human disaster. On the side of peace is the continuation and promotion of the fine traditions of human culture, brilliant construction, and a better life every day; on the side of war is the destruction of human culture, heinous greed, bringing unemployment, hunger, death, burning bombs, poison gas bombs and epidemic bacteria to the world, ruins!

More specifically: one side is the joy of the people, the enthusiastic selfless labor and great construction, manifested in the magnificent reconstruction projects such as Stalingrad or Warsaw; manifested in the huge scale and amazing completion speed of the Volga-Don Canal project in the Soviet Union; manifested in the scale of the Huai River control project in New China and the enthusiasm of millions of people working; manifested in the number of millions of square meters of houses built in New China in two years and a few months. The other side is the pain, disappointment, and frantic war preparations of the war-mongers, which is reflected in the decline of people's lives in many countries, the disrepair of cities, the lack of fuel and food, and the stagnation of production, etc.; reflected in the strange phenomenon of the country that propagates the production of atomic bombs causing major rivers to flood, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless; reflected in the "civilized" countries using a large number of planes and ships to load tens of millions of young people, bypassing half the earth, to bomb countless peaceful cities and villages in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and cruelly massacre residents in large numbers, such barbaric and shameful facts.

Due to the painful lessons of the last war, more and more people are convinced today that ensuring human happiness requires first of all stopping and extinguishing war; and the responsibility for stopping and extinguishing war lies with each of us. As long as each of us strives to win and defend peace with various actions, the power of peace must be greater than the power of the evil war propagandists.

We, who are engaged in construction work, because we know how beautiful, pleasant, but also complicated and detailed it is to build houses, streets and cities with our own hands, feel that striving for peace is our sacred duty. We understand best how the colleagues of the past, for decades or hundreds of years, or even thousands of years, have built many beautiful buildings around the world that we are proud of today with their own hands, and thus we are even more indignant and hateful of the heinous bombing that destroys entire cities.

We Chinese construction workers love our own creations, because our work is to create a better environment for the better life of the next generation, to build better factories for our workers, to build convenient farms for our farmers, to create conditions for annual harvests, to build thousands of brand-new towns and villages for our 500 million people, and to build our beautiful and solemn capital Beijing more magnificently and brilliantly. All our work is for peace; all our work needs peace. The misfortune suffered by our brothers and sisters in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and the destruction of their cities, is like a bomb falling beside us. The destruction of their peaceful construction achievements makes us feel the same pain as the destruction of our own construction achievements. Moreover, we believe that if we allow barbaric war to wantonly destroy in one, two, ... places without stopping it, the destruction in more other places will become more possible. Chinese construction workers fully support the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and support the national liberation struggles of all colonies and dependent countries, in order to extinguish the imperialists' wars of aggression and preparations for aggression in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and other places, for the restoration of the peaceful life of the people of the world, and also to ensure our own peaceful construction.

Comrade Joseph Szukal, the chief engineer of Warsaw, suggested (see "Defend Peace" magazine, issue 8, January 1952) that a conference be convened for architects and builders from the cities that have suffered the most from the war to discuss how to rebuild the destroyed cities or cities that are being destroyed, and to jointly find ways to save other cities. He believes that architects from any city and any country, no matter what system they are under, have a responsibility to coordinate with each other to discuss these issues together. We fully agree with Comrade Szukal's opinion.

The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has been held in Beijing. Chinese construction workers unanimously support and support this conference. We would like to extend our warmest congratulations to its success and wish the official meeting to be held as scheduled. We want to stand with the people of the entire Asia and Pacific region to strive for and defend peace in the Asia and Pacific region, because peace in Asia and the Pacific is part of world peace; ensuring peace in Asia and the Pacific can further promote world peace, so that kind people all over the world can return to peaceful life, so that peaceful construction all over the world can be carried out, and build a better living environment for mankind day by day.

    建筑工作者拥护和平
    中国建筑工程学会筹备委员会主任委员　梁思成
    第二次世界大战中许多国家的许多城市，曾被法西斯蒂所发动的疯狂战争所破坏而成为废墟。那里人民的生命、财产、文化宝藏、工作和理想，曾在几年中日夜被可怕的战争炮火摧毁着，磨折着。无数的人民丧失了和平生活的幸福。他们曾不顾一切地以全付精神、整个生命来抵抗侵略者，保卫着自己的家乡和国土。他们终于战胜了侵略者，结束了大战。这无数生命和血泪所换来的战争之结束是太可宝贵了！
    上次大战结束了，但几年中从悲苦的深渊重新回到被毁过的家乡，从灰烬上面重新建造房屋、街道、工厂、学校、托儿所，公园、图书馆、医院、……这中间的艰巨繁难，没有谁比我们这一代的工人和工程师、建筑师们知道得更清楚了。
    多么奇异与不应有的对比！当斯大林格勒、华沙、民主德国的柏林、基辅、布达佩斯特，重庆、广州、桂林这些城市英勇地重建起来，而且建造得比以前更加庄严美丽的时候，不但鹿特丹、哥文特里、哥龙、广岛、马尼拉等城市至今大部仍是一片瓦砾，没有恢复建设的迹象，连没有被敌人侵占的伦敦的被毁过的区域也仅仅清除了一些残砖碎瓦。而且美丽的历史名城，朝鲜的古都平壤和许多有文物古迹的城镇反被“最现代的”“最科学的”武器野蛮地夷为一片平地！这是什么原故呢？原因很明显。今天许多国家中的和平建设所以能够进行，就是因为它是人民普遍的愿望，而得到了全国一致的支持，政府和人民一起以最大的力量和信心来努力的结果。反之，在其他一些国家中，人民的愿望被抹煞，呼吁被窒息；战争贩子为了自己血腥的贪欲，违反人类最基本的要求——和平生活——集中力量，搜刮人民血汗来准备另一次侵略战争。是庞大的军事预算剥夺了人民的收入；是疯狂的军事生产夺取了日常消费生产和建筑材料的原料。因此，很多的城市便停止在废墟的情况中，不得修整或重建。而且，当罪恶的战争宣传发展到了挑衅和“试验”侵略的时候，无数的天真青年便被欺骗到战场去破坏他人的乡土家园。
    今天事实就是这样明白地摆在我们面前：和平和战争——一边是人类的幸福，一边是人类的灾难。在和平一边是人类文化优良传统的持续与发扬，辉煌的建设，每日每时地走向更美好的生活；在战争一边是人类文化的摧毁，罪恶的贪婪，给全世界带来失业、饥饿、死亡，也带来燃烧炸弹、毒气弹和疫病的细菌，废墟！
    更具体地来说：一边是人民的喜悦，热情忘我的劳动和伟大的建设，表现在斯大林格勒或华沙那样辉煌的重建工程上；表现在苏联的伏尔加—顿运河工程的巨大规模和惊人的完成速度上；表现在新中国治淮工程的规模与几百万人热烈工作的情绪上；表现在新中国在两年零几个月中所建成的数百万平方公尺的房屋数量上。另一边却是人民的痛苦、失望和战争煽动家疯狂的备战，这表现在许多国家人民生活的低降，城市的失修，燃料食品的缺乏和生产的停滞等等悲惨境遇上；表现在宣传制造原子弹的国家里让大河流泛滥为灾，十万人无家可归的奇异现象上；表现在“文明”的国家用大量飞机轮船装载了千千万万的青年，绕过半个地球，去炸毁朝鲜、越南、马来亚的无数和平城市村庄，并残酷地大量屠杀居民，这样野蛮而可耻的事实上。
    由于上次大战的惨痛教训，今天已有越来越多的人确信：确保人类的幸福首先就要制止战争、扑灭战争；而制止战争、扑灭战争的责任就在我们每一个人身上。只要我们每个人努力以各种行动争取和平，保卫和平，和平的力量一定大过于罪恶的战争宣传者的力量。
    我们做建筑工作的人，因为知道用自己的双手建造房屋、街道、城市是一种怎样美好、愉快但也繁难细致的工作，所以感到争取和平乃是自己神圣的义务。我们最了解过去的时代里，几十年或几百年乃至几千年的同业者，怎样用他们的双手给我们建造起我们今天所引为骄傲的全世界许多美丽的建筑物，因而对于摧毁整个城市的罪恶的轰炸就更加愤慨和憎恨。
    我们中国的建筑工作者爱我们自己的创造，因为我们的工作是为下一代更美好的生活创造更美好的环境，为我们的工人建造更好的厂房，为我们的农民建造工作方便的农庄，创造年年丰收的条件，为我们五亿人民建造千千万万的崭新的城镇村庄，把我们美丽庄严的首都北京建设得更加辉煌灿烂。我们的一切工作是为了和平；我们的一切工作需要和平。朝鲜、越南、马来亚的兄弟姊妹所遭受的不幸，他们的城市之被毁，就像炸弹落在我们自己身旁一样。他们的和平建设的成果之被破坏，使我们感受到同自己的建设成果被破坏一样的悲痛。不但如此，我们相信，如果我们让野蛮的战争在一个、两个、……地方肆意破坏而不加以制止，另外更多地方的破坏就愈变成可能。中国的建筑工作者全力支援英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，声援一切殖民地、附属国的民族解放斗争，就是为了要扑灭帝国主义者在朝鲜、越南、马来亚等地的侵略战争和侵略准备，为了全世界人民和平生活的恢复，也为了保障我们自己的和平建设。
    华沙的总工程师约瑟·须嘉林同志曾建议（见“保卫和平”杂志第八期，一九五二年一月）召集一个会议，由遭受战祸最惨的城市底建筑师和营造者提出对于破坏了的城市或者正在有人加以破坏的城市如何重建的问题加以讨论，并共同寻找可以挽救别的城市的方法。他认为任何城市和任何国家的建筑师，不问他们处在什么制度之下，都有责任彼此取得协调，一起来讨论这些问题。我们完全赞同须嘉林同志的意见。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议已在北京举行。中国的建筑工作者一致拥护并支持这个会议。我们谨以最大的热忱祝贺它的成功，并预祝正式会议的如期召开。我们要同全亚洲和太平洋区域的人民站在一起争取并保卫亚洲和太平洋区域的和平，因为亚洲和太平洋的和平是世界和平的一部分；亚洲和太平洋的和平有了保障就更可以促进全世界的和平，使全世界善良的人民得以回到和平的生活，使全世界的和平建设得以进行，为人类建造一天比一天美好的生活环境。
