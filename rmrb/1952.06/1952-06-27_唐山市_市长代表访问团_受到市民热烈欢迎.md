To the Editor: I am reporting something to you.

In mid-April of this year, the Tangshan City People's Government of Hebei Province, in order to collect citizens' opinions on the work of the People's Government and to understand the living conditions of citizens, organized a "Mayor's Representative Visiting Group" to go deep into various districts and streets of the city to visit the masses. The people of Tangshan City put forward many constructive opinions to the visiting group, and also raised problems that they had been eager to solve for several years. For example, all employees in the city requested the government to solve their housing problems; the government has decided to build 15,000 staff and workers' housing units in 1952, and decided to completely solve the housing problems of employees within three years. Another example is that citizens requested the construction of schools; the government decided to build schools to meet the needs of the masses. When the "Mayor's Representative Visiting Group" visited Linxi in the Seventh District, local women requested the government to handle the case of Chen Yukui killing his wife. The Tangshan City People's Court immediately began preparations and convened a public trial of Chen Yukui on June 13. In accordance with the judgment approved by the higher court, Chen was sentenced to death on the spot. Many women who participated in the public trial reflected: "Now what we women say really matters. As long as what we ask for is reasonable, the government will agree."

The people of Tangshan City are quite satisfied with the work of the "Mayor's Representative Visiting Group." I think this working method of Tangshan City can be used as a reference for other regions.

### 唐山市“市长代表访问团”受到市民热烈欢迎

    唐山市“市长代表访问团”受到市民热烈欢迎
    编辑同志：我报告你们一件事情。
    今年四月中旬，河北省唐山市人民政府为了搜集市民对人民政府工作的意见和了解市民的生活情况，曾经组织了“市长代表访问团”，深入全市各区、街，向群众进行访问。唐山市人民向访问团提出了许多建设性的意见，也提出了几年来渴望解决的问题。如全市职工要求政府给他们解决住房问题；政府已决定在一九五二年盖工房一万五千间，并决定在三年中彻底解决职工住房问题。又如市民要求修建学校；政府就决定修建学校，以满足群众要求。当“市长代表访问团”到七区林西访问时，当地妇女要求政府处理陈玉魁杀妻案，唐山市人民法院便立即进行准备工作，并在六月十三日召开了公审陈玉魁的大会，当场依照上级法院批准的判决，把陈犯处死刑。许多参加公审大会的妇女反映：“现在咱们妇女说的话真顶事。咱们要求的事只要合理，政府就答应。”
    唐山市人民对“市长代表访问团”的工作是相当满意的。我认为唐山市的这一工作方法可以供其他地区参考。 周荫铎
