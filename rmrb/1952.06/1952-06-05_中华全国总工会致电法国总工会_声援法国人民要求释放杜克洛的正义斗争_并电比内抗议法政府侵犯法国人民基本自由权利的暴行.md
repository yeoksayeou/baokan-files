(Xinhua News Agency, June 4th) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor, voicing support for their just struggle demanding the release of Duclos and other patriots; and sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Pinay, protesting the French government's illegal atrocities violating the basic freedom rights of the French people. The texts of the two telegrams are as follows:

    Telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor:
    We are extremely indignant upon hearing the news of the illegal arrest of Duclos, the great son of the French people, and many other patriots. This is a shameful fascist atrocity by the French government, under the direction of American imperialists, to systematically suppress the heroic struggle of the French working class and the French people to win national independence and defend peace. The Chinese working class expresses its resolute protest against this atrocity. We extend our highest respect to those French patriots who held demonstrations against the germ warfare criminal Ridgway and American war plans! We firmly support your just actions demanding the release of Duclos and other patriots, and we wish you glorious victory in the struggle against American war plans and in defense of peace.
                                                            
                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions, June 4th

    Protest Telegram to the French Government:
    To Mr. Pinay, Prime Minister of France:
    We are extremely indignant upon hearing the news of the illegal arrest of Duclos, the loyal son of the French people, and other patriots. The French people's opposition to the arrival in France of the germ warfare criminal Ridgway and to American war plans is a just struggle to win national independence and defend peace. Therefore, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Chinese working class, expresses its resolute protest against this measure by the French government, which violates the basic freedom rights of the French people, and demands the immediate release of Duclos and other French patriots.
                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions, June 4th
