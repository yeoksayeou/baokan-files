    Reflections on International Children's Day
    Xu Zhengfan
    (I)
    The notorious Washington "Herald" once published an article full of bloody smell: "The purpose of our war is to eliminate enemy countries... Our planes will fly at an altitude of 40,000 feet, carrying atomic bombs, incendiary bombs, germ bombs and bombs, in order to kill children in their cradles, kill the old people in their prayers, kill the workers in their work..."
    This is truly an inhuman howl! Millions of loving mothers are looking forward to their children's growth day and night, but some people are planning and implementing "killing children in their cradles."
    "People" who have no confidence in tomorrow will never value the future of mankind, and will never cherish the continuators of human life—children. The dying class plans this way: to bury the whole world with them.
    But children will still grow up all over the world. Every warmonger struggles to death, but only stinks a few square feet of earth.
    Just as the earth will never stop its movement just because it carries the corpses of this group of warmongers, society will still develop according to the law: "The demise of the bourgeoisie and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable." (Marx and Engels)
    (II)
    A document from the New York Board of Education reads: "We should perhaps learn how to defend against (should be read as "use") atomic bombs, just as we have learned to brush our teeth every day to protect our teeth from decay."
    Using atomic bombs to kill people has become a daily compulsory course. It should be said that this is a unique content of American education of "civilization". Brushing your teeth every day can indeed protect children's teeth, and forcing children to "learn" to kill people with atomic bombs every day can indeed corrode their hearts. What the warmongers need is not white teeth, but dark hearts.
    American laborers have no money to send their children to school anyway. However, let us think about what kind of damage will be done to the minds of those naive children who have the money to enjoy atomic bomb education! Harming children is harming the future of mankind. By then, the United States may have fallen into the abyss of destruction. However, the facts must not be so, because there is a proletariat in the United States.
    (III)
    The American Ku Klux Klan, notorious for its expertise in murder and arson, has officially established its own children's organization, including children as young as five years old. The purpose is to "cultivate" children's killing habits and "nurture" them with the spirit of hatred for mankind.
    The sin of American imperialism lies not only in turning living children into bloody corpses; it also lies in their attempt to strangle the kind hearts of children, and cast them into killing machines—turning the continuators of human life into destroyers of human life.
    However, the blood of the killed children will wash people's eyes bright.

    国际儿童节杂感

    （一）
    臭名远扬的华盛顿“导报”，曾经刊出这样一篇充满血腥气味的文章：“我们战争的目的是消灭敌对国家……我们的飞机将飞翔在四万英尺的高空，载着原子弹、烧夷弹、细菌弹和炸弹，为了杀死儿童在他们的摇篮里，杀死年老人在他们祈祷时，杀死工人们在他们的工作中……”
    这真是地地道道的绝灭人性的狂吠！千百万慈母日日夜夜期待着孩子的成长，有人却计划着并实行着“杀死儿童在他们的摇篮里”。
    对明天没有信心的“人”，绝不会重视人类的将来，绝不会珍惜人类生命的延续者——儿童。垂死的阶级这样打算：拿全世界殉葬。
    但孩子们仍然要在世界各地长大起来。每一个战争贩子挣扎到死，也不过臭掉地球上的几方尺土。
    正像地球绝不因载着这批战争贩子的尸体而就停止其运动一样，社会也仍然会合规律地发展下去：“资产阶级底灭亡和无产阶级底胜利同样是不可避免的。”（马克思、恩格斯）
    （二）
    纽约教育当局的一个文件上这样写道：“我们也许应该学习怎样防备（应读为“使用”）原子弹，就如同我们曾学习每天刷牙来保护我们的牙齿不受腐蛀一样。”
    用原子弹杀人成为每日必修的课程，应该说这是“文明”的美国教育特有的内容。每天刷牙的确可以保护儿童的牙齿，每天逼着孩子们“学习”用原子弹杀人，也的确可以腐蚀他们的心灵。战争贩子所需要的不是洁白的牙齿，而是污黑的心灵。
    美国劳动者横竖是没有钱把儿女送进学校的。但是，我们想一想，那些有钱去享受原子弹教育的天真的孩子们，他们的心灵会遭到怎样的摧残！伤害儿童就是伤害着人类的未来，到那时，美国也许已经堕入了毁灭的深渊。然而，事实一定不至如此，因为美国有无产阶级在。
    （三）
    因擅长杀人放火而臭名昭著的美国三K党，正式建立了自己的儿童组织，包括有五岁的儿童。其目的是：“培养”儿童的杀人习惯，以仇恨人类的精神“哺育”他们。
    美帝国主义者的罪恶，不仅仅在于他们把活生生的儿童变成血淋淋的尸体；还在于他们企图绞杀儿童善良的心地，把他们铸造成为杀人的机器——变人类生命之延续者为人类生命之毁灭者。
    但是，被杀的孩子们的血，会洗亮人们的眼睛。
