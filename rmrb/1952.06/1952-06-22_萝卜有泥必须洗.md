Radishes Have Mud, They Must Be Washed
    Sun Juping
    Some teachers, after liberation, have not undergone serious and conscious ideological remolding, and to this day still retain bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts, even reactionary thoughts, brought from the old society, and use them to educate students. One teacher, when conducting health education for students, said: "Only with a healthy body can you travel and enjoy the scenery, live by the piano, and have happiness." Another teacher, when talking about the Boxer Indemnity, said: "Because the United States felt that the oppression of China was too severe, they abandoned aggression and used the Boxer Indemnity to establish schools." There are many such examples.

    However, the seriousness of the problem does not stop there. What is more serious is that some teachers, although they know that their thinking is backward, even reactionary, are fundamentally unwilling to remold themselves. They say: "There is a shortage of teachers at present. If there is a shortage of radishes, you don't wash the mud off. If they don't want you here, they'll want you there." Meaning, even without ideological remolding, there is still no problem in being a teacher. They clearly know that there is a problem with their thinking, but because there is a shortage of teachers at present, they are unwilling to remold themselves. They know they "have mud," but they are unwilling to wash it off.

    Obviously, in the minds of these teachers, there is only the individual and no people. They are only willing to enjoy the name of people's teacher, but do not intend to have the substance of a people's teacher; they never consider improving their work or teaching students well. They do not see the glorious task of teachers and the brilliant future of the people's education cause, only seeing the point that "there is a shortage of teachers," and think they are a rare commodity. This is precisely the manifestation of bourgeois selfishness, self-interest, and speculative thinking.

    "There is a shortage of teachers at present," this is a fact. But what kind of teachers are we short of? What we are short of are teachers who can arm students with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and scientific knowledge; what we are short of are teachers who can cultivate outstanding talents for national construction; what we are short of are teachers who love the people, love young people and children, and can humbly learn from them and serve them wholeheartedly. We do not lack teachers who only plan for themselves, disregarding the future of the country and students; we do not need teachers who poison young people and children with a head full of backward and reactionary thoughts.

    Since these teachers have already seen the mud on their radishes, then they should not hesitate and quickly jump into the sea of ideological remolding to take a bath. When you can't wash it off yourself, everyone helps each other and is determined to wash off the mud, so that you become a clean and beautiful sweet radish. Only in this way can people get nourishment from you without being poisoned!

    The ideological remolding movement is being carried out universally and deeply. The people of the whole country and young students are welcoming us to do this with excitement and enthusiasm, and we must also do so.

    Therefore, we say: "Radishes have mud, they must be washed!"

    “萝卜有泥必须洗”
    孙居平
    有些教师解放后没有经过认真的自觉的思想改造，到今天还保留着从旧社会带来的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，甚至反动思想，并用它来教育学生。一位教师对学生进行健康教育时说：“只有健康的身体，才能游山玩水，才能坐在钢琴旁边生活，才能有幸福。”一位教师在讲庚子赔款时说：“因为美国感到对中国的压迫太厉害了，所以才放弃侵略，用庚子赔款来办学校。”像这样的例子是很多的。
    然而，问题的严重性并不止此，更严重的是有些教师虽知道自己的思想是落后的，甚至反动的，却根本不愿意改造。他们说：“目前教师缺少，萝卜缺了不洗泥，这里不要那里要。”意思是，不改造思想，当个教师还没有问题。他们明明知道自己的思想是有问题的，却因目前教师缺乏，就不愿意改造。他们自知“有泥”，却不愿意洗一洗。
    很明显，在这些教师的心目中，只有个人而没有人民。他们只愿享有人民教师的名，却不打算具有人民教师的实；他们从来不考虑改进工作，教好学生的事。他们看不到教师的光荣任务和人民教育事业的辉煌前途，单看到“教师缺少”这一点，就认为奇货可居了。这正是资产阶级自私自利、投机取巧思想的表现。
    “目前教师缺少”，这是事实。但是，我们所缺少的是什么样的教师呢？我们所缺少的是，能够以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和科学知识去武装学生的教师；我们所缺少的是能够给国家培养出优秀的建设人才的教师；我们所缺少的是热爱人民、热爱青年和儿童，并能虚心向他们学习、全心全意为他们服务的教师。我们并不缺少专为个人打算，置国家、学生的前途于不顾的教师，我们并不需要以满脑袋落后思想、反动思想来毒害青年和儿童的教师。
    既然这些教师已经看到了自己萝卜上的污泥，那么，就应该毫不迟疑，赶快跳进思想改造的大海里洗一洗澡。自己洗不掉时，大家互相帮助，下决心把污泥洗掉，使自己变成一个清洁而美丽的甜萝卜。只有这样，人们才能从你那里得到营养而不致中毒！
    思想改造运动，正在普遍而深入地开展着。全国人民和青年学生，都正在以兴奋热烈的心情欢迎着我们这样做，我们也必须这样做。
    因此，我们说：“萝卜有泥必须洗！”
