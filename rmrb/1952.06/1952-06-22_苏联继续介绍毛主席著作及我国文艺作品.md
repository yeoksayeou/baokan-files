The Soviet cultural circles continue to introduce Chairman Mao's works and the works of Chinese writers, and widely introduce Chinese art and general conditions. Following the publication of the Russian translation of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong", Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" has recently been translated into Russian and published in the ninth and tenth issues of the bi-monthly "Bolshevik" in May. Among the Chinese literary works recently published in the Soviet Union is a new edition of Mao Dun's novel "Midnight", translated by Lydman, with a new preface written by the translator. Zhao Shuli's "Rhymes of Li Youcai" and Chen Dengke's "Living Tomb" have been translated into Russian by Rogov and published in "New World Literature Monthly". "Rhymes of Li Youcai" was also printed as a separate book by the Pravda Publishing House and included in the "Little Spark Picture Album Series". Ai Qing's collection of poems "Dawn's Notice" has recently been translated into Russian by Gitovich, including twenty-four poems such as "Dawn's Notice", "Defend Peace", and "Dedicated to Stalin". The collection includes a preface written by Petrov and was edited by Rogov.

The Soviet Art Publishing House published a book entitled "Chinese Art", which includes articles such as "The Art of a Great Nation" by the famous painter Gerasimov, "The Creative Tasks of New Chinese Painters" by Yan Han, "Ancient Chinese Art" by Zheng Zhenduo et al., "Modern Chinese Art" by Cai Ruohong et al., "Chinese Art Heritage" by Grukhalyova, "Art of the People's Republic of China" by Chigadaev, and "Soviet Audience's Criticism of the Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of China" by Vinogradova.

Recently, the Moscow Vakhtangov Theatre is rehearsing the play based on Rogov's latest translation and will soon be publicly performed. The play adopts the form of a drama, changing from five acts to four acts, and the music has also been rewritten by the famous composer Kolchmarev.
