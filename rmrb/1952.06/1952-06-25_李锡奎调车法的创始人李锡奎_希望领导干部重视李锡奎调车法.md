To the Editor:

In late May, the Director of the Rolling Stock Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Comrade Zaderojny, a Soviet expert, and I inspected the implementation of the Li Xikui shunting method in the Zhengzhou, Hengyang, Shanghai, and Jinan Railway Administrations. I learned that all stations have begun to promote the Li Xikui shunting method; however, due to different promotion times and varying degrees of importance attached by leading cadres, the promotion work is not balanced enough. All shunting teams in Zhengzhou Station have implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, but Shanghai Maigen Road Station and Hankou Jiang'an Station have just started to promote it. Some station leaders attach great importance to the promotion work, so it is done well, while some station leaders do not attach importance to the promotion work, so it is not done well. I deeply feel that the key to doing a good job in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method lies in leadership. Some leading cadres do not attach importance to the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method because they still have conservative ideas. They are indifferent to new things and do not understand what the Li Xikui shunting method is all about, believing that "any shunting method that shortens dwell time is a good shunting method," so they do not actively lead workers to implement it. Some leading cadres emphasize "poor equipment" and "prone to accidents," adopting a passive attitude towards promotion work. Some leading cadres even stifle the enthusiasm of on-site workers to actively learn the Li Xikui shunting method, saying things like "nothing can be promoted without changing the line" and "if there is an accident with continuous shunting, I will not be responsible." Some leading cadres are unconventional, arbitrarily changing the content of the Li Xikui shunting method, changing the "three-car system" to a "five-car, three-car, one-car five-meter system," which is neither practical nor effective. All of these seriously hinder the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method.

In order to better carry out the full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement, I believe that it is necessary to further and conscientiously implement the Li Xikui shunting method. Therefore, I urge railway leaders at all levels to attach importance to the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method, support the on-site workers in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, and help solve the difficulties encountered by the workers in the promotion process.

    希望领导干部重视李锡奎调车法
    编辑同志：五月下旬，我和铁道部车务局局长及苏联专家札得罗日内同志，到郑州、衡阳、上海、济南等铁路管理局检查李锡奎调车法推行情况。我了解到各站都开始推广李锡奎调车法；但由于推广的时间不同，领导干部重视的程度不一样，因此推广工作还不够平衡。郑州站全部调车组都实行了李锡奎调车法，但上海麦根路站、汉口江岸站还刚刚开始推行。有的站的领导干部比较重视推广工作，因之就做得比较好，有的站的领导干部不重视推广工作，因之就做得不好。我深深感到做好李锡奎调车法的推广工作的关键是在于领导。有些领导干部所以不重视李锡奎调车法的推广工作，主要是因为他们还有保守思想。他们对于新事物漠不关心，还不了解李锡奎调车法是怎样一回事，认为“什么李锡奎，李金奎，缩短停留时间，就是好调车法”，所以他们不积极领导职工去实行。有些领导干部强调
    “设备不好”“容易出事故”，对推广工作采取了消极态度。甚至有些领导干部打击现场工友积极学习李锡奎调车法的情绪，说什么“不改线，什么也推行不了”“连续溜放，出了事故，我可不负责”。有的领导干部标新立异，随便改变李锡奎调车法的内容，把“三车制”改为“五车、三车、一车五公尺制”，既不切合实际，亦不起作用。所有这些，都严重地阻碍了李锡奎调车法的推广工作。
    为了很好地开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，我认为必须进一步认真地贯彻李锡奎调车法。因此我要求铁路各级领导干部重视李锡奎调车法的推广工作，支持现场工人们推广李锡奎调车法，并帮助解决工人们在推广过程中的困难问题。
