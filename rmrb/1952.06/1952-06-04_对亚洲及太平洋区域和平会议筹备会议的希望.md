    Under the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of peace-loving people in Asian and Pacific countries, the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is being held in Beijing starting June 3rd. This is a major event in the cause of peace for the people of Asian and Pacific countries; this is an important link in the struggle for lasting world peace.
    Since eleven prominent figures in our country's peace efforts, including Soong Ching Ling, Guo Moruo, and Peng Zhen, representing the peace aspirations of the Chinese people and accepting the suggestions of India and other friendly countries, jointly sent a telegram on March 21st inviting prominent figures who love peace and justice in Asian and Pacific countries to jointly initiate the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, it quickly received an enthusiastic response from peace-loving people in Asian and Pacific countries. Various countries have successively established their own preparatory committees for participation in the conference, nominated patriotic, reputable, and peace-loving people to participate in the joint initiation, and with the consent of the initiators from various countries, decided to first hold the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing.
    Thanks to the concerted efforts of peace movement leaders and the broad masses of peace-loving people from various countries in the past two months, much preparatory work has been actively carried out. Currently, forty-five representatives from nineteen countries have gathered in Beijing to begin holding the preparatory meeting. Two secretaries from the Secretariat of the World Peace Council and two members of the Asian-Australian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions are also participating in this meeting. Representatives from five other countries are on their way to Beijing. Among the representatives from various countries participating in this preparatory meeting, there are people of various nationalities, different classes, different religious beliefs, and different political views; among them are scientists, educators, writers, scholars, professors, artists, journalists, trade union leaders, peasant movement leaders, women leaders, national industrialists and businesspeople, agricultural operators, religious figures, peace movement workers, and other peace-loving people. Although this is a preparatory meeting, it possesses broad representation. The people of all Asian and Pacific countries have placed infinite hopes on this preparatory meeting; the people of our country warmly congratulate the success of this preparatory meeting.
    At a time when world peace and security are repeatedly facing serious threats, and the peace of the Asian and Pacific region is facing direct danger, the holding of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will undoubtedly make a great contribution to further preparing for the early convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, to strengthening the unity of the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and to defending peace and preventing new schemes of aggressive war.
    The struggles of the people of Asian and Pacific countries for peace have been glorious and inspiring. The strength of the Japanese people in their struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace is growing stronger day by day; the peace movement of the people of Southeast Asia and Australia is developing more vigorously; and the strength of the people of North and South American countries in their struggle for independence and peace is also growing stronger day by day. The demands of the people of Asian and Pacific countries for the development of mutual cultural and trade relations are also increasingly manifested in many practical actions. These fully demonstrate that the desire for peace of the people of Asian and Pacific countries has been constantly manifested as active struggles and various practical actions. However, in order to make these struggles and practical actions achieve the greater effect they deserve, it is still necessary to further unite the strength of the people of Asian and Pacific countries. This broad unity has become an increasingly urgent demand of the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and this demand is completely reasonable.
    Now, the holding of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is a symbol and beginning of the further unity of the strength of the people of Asian and Pacific countries. We firmly believe that this preparatory meeting will effectively promote this unity, and only this unity can defeat all the destructive schemes of the enemies of peace. We must fully estimate that the instigators of war will inevitably adopt various despicable means to obstruct and undermine the unity of the people of Asian and Pacific countries and this preparatory meeting and future peace conferences. In order to defeat the destructive schemes of the enemies of peace, closer unity among the people of all countries is even more necessary. As the eleven Chinese peace advocates said in their initiation letter, "Peace cannot wait; peace requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it. If the people of the Asian and Pacific region mobilize and strive for peace, the peace of the Asian and Pacific region can be guaranteed."
    The representatives participating in the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, the broad masses of peace-loving people in all Asian and Pacific countries, must all be fully vigilant to prevent the enemies of peace from carrying out destructive activities against this conference. Everyone must take the interests of the entire peace cause as a prerequisite, unite and be consistent on general principles, so that all the tricks of sowing discord, slander, and defamation played by the enemies of peace cannot be used. We will not do anything that the enemies of peace like; we must do what the enemies of peace consider a headache. Putting the common interests of peace-loving people in the primary position, and using this to divide the boundaries between justice and injustice, good and evil, should be the goal that this conference strives to achieve.
    As the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference begins, the people of our country sincerely congratulate this meeting and the representatives participating in the meeting on their eternal victory in the great cause of defending peace. Let the desire for peace and unity of the people of all Asian and Pacific countries be transformed into an invincible iron will and strength for defending peace!

    对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的希望
    在亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国广大爱好和平的人民热烈拥护之下，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议，从六月三日起在北京举行。这是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民保卫和平事业中的重大事件；这是争取世界持久和平的斗争的一个重要环节。
    自从我国努力和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若、彭真等十一人，代表我国人民的和平意愿，并接受印度及其他友邦人士的建议，于三月二十一日联名发电邀请亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平与正义的著名人士，共同发起亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议以后，迅速得到了亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平人士的热烈响应。各国纷纷成立了本国参加会议的筹备委员会，推定了本国对和平事业有贡献有声望的及爱好和平的人士参加联名发起，并经过各国发起人的同意，决定在北京首先举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。
    由于近两月来各国和平运动领袖及广大爱好和平人民的一致努力，积极进行了许多准备工作，现已有十九个国家的四十五位代表聚集北京，开始举行筹备会议。世界和平理事会书记处两位秘书、世界工会联合会亚澳联络局两位委员也参加了这个会议。还有五个国家的代表正在来北京的途中。参加这个筹备会议的各国代表中，有各种不同的民族、不同的阶层、不同的宗教信仰以及不同的政治见解的人士；其中有科学家、教育家、文学家、学者、教授、艺术工作者、新闻工作者、工会领袖、农民运动领袖、妇女领袖、民族工商业家、农业经营者、宗教家、和平运动工作者以及其他爱好和平的人士。这虽然是一个筹备会议，但它具备了广泛的代表性。全亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对于这个筹备会议都寄予了无限的希望；我国人民更热烈地祝贺这个筹备会议的成功。
    当着全世界的和平与安全一再遭受到严重的威胁，而亚洲及太平洋区域的和平更遭受到直接危害的时候，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的举行，对于进一步准备早日召开亚洲及太平洋区域的和平会议，对于加强亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的团结，对于保卫和平及制止新侵略战争的阴谋，无疑地都会有巨大的贡献。
    亚洲及太平洋沿岸的各国人民在为争取和平而进行的斗争，曾是可歌可泣的。日本人民为民族独立、民主与和平而斗争的力量正日益增强；东南亚洲及澳洲各国人民保卫和平的运动正日益蓬勃发展；南北美洲各国人民为争取独立与和平而斗争的力量也正日益壮大。亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民对于发展相互间的文化和贸易的要求，同样日益表现在许多实际的行动上。这些都充分地说明，亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民对于和平的愿望，已经不断地表现为积极的斗争和各种实际的行动了。然而，要使这些斗争和实际行动收到应有的更大的效果，就还必须使亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的力量进一步团结起来。这种广泛的团结，已经成为亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民日益迫切的要求，而这种要求是完全合理的。
    现在，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的举行，就是亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民力量进一步团结起来的象征和开端。我们深信这个筹备会议一定能够有效地促进这种团结，只有这种团结才能够战胜和平的敌人的一切破坏阴谋。我们必须充分地估计到战争的挑拨者们对于亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的团结和这个筹备会议及今后的和平会议，必将采取各式各样的卑劣手段，企图加以阻挠和破坏。为了战胜和平的敌人的破坏阴谋，就更需要各国人民的紧密团结。正如我国十一位和平人士在发起书中所说的，“和平绝不能等待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民动员起来，争取和平，亚洲及太平洋区域的和平即能得到保证。”
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的代表们，全亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平的广大人民，大家都要有充分的警惕性，防止和平的敌人可能进行对于这个会议的破坏活动。大家要以整个的和平事业的利益为前提，在总的原则上团结一致，使和平的敌人所玩弄的挑拨离间、诽谤中伤等一切伎俩都不能施展。凡属和平的敌人所喜欢的事情，我们都不做；凡属和平的敌人所认为头痛的事情，我们就一定要做。把爱好和平人民的共同利益放在首要的地位，并以此来划分正义与非正义、善与恶的界限，这应该是这个会议所要努力实现的。
    当此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议开始举行的时候，我国人民热诚地祝贺这个会议和参加会议的代表们在伟大的保卫和平的事业中永远胜利。让全亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的和平与团结的愿望，变成保卫和平的不可战胜的钢铁意志和力量！
