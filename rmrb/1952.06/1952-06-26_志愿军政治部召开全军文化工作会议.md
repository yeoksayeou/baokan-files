The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened a nine-day All-Army Cultural Work Conference in late May. This conference was held to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," to further implement the policy of "comprehensively developing mass-based and combat-oriented recreational work" and the principle of "facing the company" and "serving the soldiers," and to review the army's literary and artistic ideology and troop recreational work. At the meeting, the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Volunteer Army Political Department first conveyed the instructions of higher authorities and put forward specific methods for realizing this policy.

In their reports, various units generally reflected that the recreational activities of various troops had begun to form a mass movement. The majority of units in the army had strengthened the work of company clubs, regularly organized evening parties, carried out singing, dancing, and wall newspapers, organized soldiers' creations, organized performances and awards, and systematically trained recreational backbones. For example, three battalions and directly subordinate units of a certain unit had 22 amateur soldier theater troupes, with a total of more than 600 people. Each company in the unit held weekly evening parties, and each month the battalions held a joint performance, selecting good programs for exchange performances. The Second Battalion of the unit created more than 1,200 Allegro pieces from August to mid-November last year. A certain unit held 71 small evening parties in the company in nearly half a year, performing more than 2,800 programs. Each company had a storytelling and singing group, and each squad had a cultural soldier. The Fifth Company of the First Battalion of a certain unit performed more than 90 programs in a competition. A certain unit launched a dance movement, and most commanders and fighters learned four or five dances. Everyone unanimously expressed in the discussion: resolutely and thoroughly implement the policy of "facing the company, serving the soldiers" and "comprehensively developing mass-based and combat-oriented recreational work."

In his concluding speech at the general meeting, Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, said: Judging from the current recreational work of the entire army, encouraging achievements have been made. In the future, cultural work should advocate singing combat songs, performing small dramas (especially operas), carrying out mass-based and magnificent dances, creating small Pingci, cross-talk, Allegro, Shulaibao, and strengthening film, slide, shadow play, and company libraries. Director Gan Siqi also made a brilliant analysis of how to improve the ideological content of works. He pointed out that the main task of cultural workers should be to provide the troops with spiritual food in terms of cultural entertainment. And cultural entertainment should be based on the word "joy." The joy mentioned here is not the joy of the bourgeoisie, but the joy that represents the proletariat. This kind of joy is the joy of resisting America and aiding Korea, the joy of fighting, the joy of enduring hardship and hard work, the joy of criticism and self-criticism, and the joy of painstaking research. Our creations, especially the ideology of our creations, should reflect these things. (Xinhua News Agency)

    志愿军政治部召开全军文化工作会议
    中国人民志愿军政治部于五月下旬召开历时九天的全军文化工作会议。这次会议是为纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年，更进一步贯彻“全面发展群众性战斗性的文娱工作”及“面向连队”“为兵服务”的方针，并检查全军文艺思想与部队文娱工作。会议先由志愿军政治部宣传部副部长传达上级指示，并提出实现这一方针的具体办法。
    各单位在汇报中，普遍反映各部队的文娱活动已开始形成群众性的运动，全军多数单位都已加强了连队俱乐部工作，经常组织晚会，开展演唱、舞蹈、墙报，组织战士创作，组织会演、评奖以及有计划地训练文娱骨干等工作。如某部的三个大队和直属队：即有战士业余剧团二十二个，共六百余人。该部各连每周都举行晚会，每月以营为单位会演一次，并选出好的节目交流演出。该部二大队在去年八月至十一月中，创作快板一千二百多个。某部在将近半年内，举行连的小型晚会七十一次，演出节目两千八百多个，各连都有说唱组，每班都有一个文化战士。该部一大队第五连在一次比赛会上，演出节目九十多个。某部展开舞蹈运动，大多数指挥员和战斗员都学会四、五个舞。大家在讨论中一致表示：坚决彻底贯彻“面向连队，为兵服务”与“全面发展群众性战斗性的文娱工作”的方针。
    志愿军政治部甘泗淇主任在总结大会讨论的发言中说：就目前全军文娱工作来看，已取得了令人兴奋的成绩。今后文化工作应提倡唱战斗性的歌，演小型的戏剧（特别是歌剧），开展群众性的雄壮的舞蹈，创作小型的平词、相声、快板、数来宝，以及加强电影、幻灯、影戏和连队图书馆等工作。甘泗淇主任对如何把作品思想性提高一步的问题，也作了精辟的分析。他指出文化工作者的主要任务，应该是供给部队文化娱乐方面的精神食粮。而文化娱乐，应以“乐”字为主。这里所说的乐，不是资产阶级之乐，而是代表无产阶级姿态的乐。这种乐，是乐于抗美援朝，乐于战斗，乐于吃苦耐劳，乐于批评和自我批评和乐于苦心钻研等。我们的创作，特别是创作的思想性，应该表现这些东西。（新华社）
