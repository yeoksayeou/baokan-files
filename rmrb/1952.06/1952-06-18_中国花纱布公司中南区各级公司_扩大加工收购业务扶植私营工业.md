The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Central South District Company and its affiliated branches, in addition to supplying raw cotton according to established processing contracts to ensure the normal production of large textile factories in the entire region, continue to expand their processing and purchasing business, vigorously supporting the production of private yarn and dyeing factories. The average quantity of products processed and purchased in the first and second quarters in the Central South District exceeded the original planned quantity by 20 percent. Among them, in Guangzhou and Xingmei, Guangdong, which are among the concentrated areas of the weaving industry in the Central South District, the products entrusted for processing and purchase increased by 100 percent. In Kaifeng and Luoyang in Henan, Jiujiang and Fuliang in Jiangxi, Xiangyang, Fancheng, Tianmen, and Huanggang in Hubei, processing orders increased by 20 to 50 percent.

The cotton yarn and cloth companies in various parts of the Central South District not only helped the production of private spinning and dyeing factories through processing and purchasing work, but also helped them change the production of certain slow-selling products in various aspects. For example, Guangzhou Tianlong Canvas Factory and Tiangong Canvas Factory used to produce canvas. Currently, because there is no market for canvas, the cotton yarn and cloth company discussed with Tianlong Canvas Factory to convert the canvas looms to weave "Pang Bielin" cloth (heavy twill); and based on the machine equipment of Tianlong Canvas Factory, converted 50 canvas looms to weave light-weight fine canvas for shoe making; and signed a processing contract with the factory to weave 3,500 pieces of light-weight canvas. The Kaifeng Second Weaving Production Cooperative in Henan also received assistance from the local cotton yarn and cloth company to switch to weaving cotton bale cloth, weaving 2,796 pieces of cotton bale cloth in three and a half months from May 6 to August 21. In Xingmei, Guangdong, in order to help hand-weaving workers tide over the spring famine, processing yarn was allocated in the form of lending yarn and regularly recovering cloth, totaling 3,000 pieces.

The processing and purchasing contract agreements signed by the cotton yarn and cloth companies in various parts of the Central South District with private textile and dyeing industries after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were closely linked with the workers of each factory beforehand to understand the true cost situation. The capitalists received profound education in the "Five-Anti" movement, so the amount of cotton used in cotton yarn and cotton cloth, dyeing materials, and cotton packaging costs were reduced by an average of 6.04 percent compared to the past. According to the production volume of the Central South District, it can save the state more than 60 billion yuan in raw material costs throughout the year.

After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the workers' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, the rate of substandard cloth in yarn factories and small weaving factories has significantly decreased, and the color of dyed cloth added by dyeing factories also meets the specified standards. Many workers said: We must not only improve product quality, but also urge capitalists to operate honestly under the leadership of state-owned enterprises and seek development from reasonable profits.

    中国花纱布公司中南区各级公司
    扩大加工收购业务扶植私营工业
    中国花纱布公司中南区公司及所属分、支公司除根据已订的加工合同供应原棉，保证了全区大型纺织厂的正常生产外，并继续扩大加工收购业务，大力扶植私营纱厂、染织厂的生产。中南区第一、二季度加工和收购的产品平均比原计划的数量扩大了百分之二十。其中，在中南区织布业集中地区之一的广州和广东兴梅，委托加工和收购的产品扩大了百分之一百，在河南的开封、洛阳，江西的九江、浮梁，湖北的襄阳、樊城、天门、黄冈等地扩大加工定货百分之二十至五十。
    中南区各地花纱布公司不但通过加工收购工作，帮助私营纺纱、染织工厂的生产，并且在各方面帮助他们改变某些滞销产品的生产。如广州天龙帆布厂和天工帆布厂，过去生产帆布。目前因为帆布没有销路，花纱布公司就和天龙帆布厂研究，把帆布机加工改织胖别林布（重磅斜纹布）；又根据天龙帆布厂的机器设备情况，把该厂五十台帆布机改织制鞋用的轻磅细帆布；并和该厂签订了代织轻磅帆布三千五百匹的加工合同。河南开封第二织布生产合作社，也得到该地花纱布公司的协助，改织棉花包布，从五月六日到八月二十一日三个半月中，代织棉花包布二千七百九十六匹。在广东兴梅则为了帮助手工织布工人度过春荒，用贷纱定期收回布匹的方式拨给了加工纱三千件。
    中南区各地花纱布公司在“三反”“五反”运动以后和私营纺织、染织业所订的加工收购合同协议，事前都和各厂工人取得了密切联系，了解真实成本情况。资方在“五反”运动中受到了深刻的教育，因而在棉纱、棉布的用棉量、染布原料、棉花打包成本等方面，平均比较以前降低了百分之六·○四，按照中南区生产量计算，全年约可为国家节省原料费用六百多亿元。
    经过“三反”“五反”运动，工人生产积极性大大提高，纱厂和小型织布厂的次布率显著降低，染厂加染布匹的色泽也都合乎规定标准。许多工人表示：我们不但要把产品质量提高，还要督促资本家在国营企业领导下老老实实地经营，从合理利润中求得发展。（靳吾）
