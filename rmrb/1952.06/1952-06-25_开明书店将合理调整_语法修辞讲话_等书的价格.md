    Kaiming Bookstore to Reasonably Adjust Prices of "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" and Other Books
    To the Editorial Department: We highly value Comrade Zhang Zheng'an's suggestion, published in the June 1st "Reader's Letters" page, that our bookstore appropriately reduce the prices of certain books. Taking "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" as an example, as cited by Comrade Zhang, the pricing is indeed a bit high. Initially, our bookstore's estimate of the sales volume of "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" was incorrect, and we treated it as a general book in terms of royalties and cost calculation, resulting in a higher price. Later, the book's sales volume continued to increase, but the price was not reduced, which was incorrect. Recently, general commodity prices have decreased, and publishing colleagues are planning to reduce book prices. The pricing of our bookstore's "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric" and other books will naturally be reasonably adjusted based on costs. Kaiming Bookstore General Management Office

### 开明书店将合理调整“语法修辞讲话”等书的价格

    开明书店将合理调整“语法修辞讲话”等书的价格
    编辑同志：我们十分重视六月一日“读者来信专页”刊载的张正安同志建议我店适当降低某些书籍价格的意见。就拿张同志所举的“语法修辞讲话”来说，定价确实是高了些。我店最初对“语法修辞讲话”的销数估计得不正确，把它当作一般书籍来处理版税和计算成本，因此定价较高。后来该书销数续有增加，而定价却没有减低，这是不对的。最近一般物价降低，出版同业正在筹划减低书价，我店“语法修辞讲话”等书定价，自当根据成本，合理地加以调整。　开明书店总管理处
