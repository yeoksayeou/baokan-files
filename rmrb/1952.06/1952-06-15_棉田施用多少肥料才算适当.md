The amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields must be appropriate. Applying too much or too little fertilizer will not achieve the goal of increasing yield per unit area. So, how much fertilizer should be applied to cotton fields to be appropriate? This depends on the soil composition, irrigation conditions, etc., in each region. Here, we introduce the fertilization situation of the Wulidian State Farm in the suburbs of Beijing and the high-yield model workers such as Qu Yaoli in Shanxi and Liang Jiarui in Hebei for your reference.

This year, the cotton fields of the Wulidian State Farm in the suburbs of Beijing are implementing increased fertilization and close planting. Each mu is planted with 4,500 plants. The farm has 800 mu of irrigated cotton fields this year, requiring a yield of 550 jin of seed cotton per mu, and 900 mu of dryland cotton fields, requiring a yield of 450 jin of seed cotton per mu. For irrigated land, apply 2,000 jin of base fertilizer soil manure, 200 jin of cottonseed cake, 40 jin of lime nitrogen, and 20 jin of superphosphate per mu. These fertilizers are first mixed into granular form, sprinkled on the ground, and turned into the soil during spring plowing. Topdressing uses 200 jin of cottonseed cake per mu, applied once when the cotton plants show buds and once when they flower, and then 10 jin of ammonium sulfate is applied again when the cotton plants are in full bloom (applied in trenches in the soil). For dry land, apply 2,000 jin of base fertilizer soil manure, 100 jin of cottonseed cake, 40 jin of lime nitrogen, and 20 jin of superphosphate per mu, mixed into granular form, sprinkled on the ground, and turned into the soil with a disc harrow in the spring. Topdressing uses 100 jin of cottonseed cake per mu, applied once when the cotton plants show buds and once when they first flower, and then 10 jin of ammonium sulfate is applied again when the cotton plants are in full bloom. All are buried in the soil in trenches. Cake fertilizers are all applied after fermentation.

Qu Yaoli, a high-yield model in Shanxi Province, produced 912 jin of seed cotton per mu on his high-yield land last year. He used a total of 12,000 jin of farm manure (mule, horse, sheep manure, etc.) as base fertilizer, and 16 jin of ammonium sulfate as topdressing, applied twice around Mangzhong (Grain in Ear) and Xia Zhi (Summer Solstice). This year, Qu Yaoli's three mu of high-yield land are planted with 3,500 plants per mu, with a planned yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu. A total of six large carts of base fertilizer (four carts of mule and horse manure, two carts of sheep manure, about 10,000 jin), and 50 jin of bone meal are applied and turned into the soil during spring plowing. He also plans to use 20 jin of ammonium sulfate, applied in three times: once around Mangzhong, once half a month later, and once when the cotton plants flower. After each topdressing, immediately cover the soil and water it to dissolve the fertilizer quickly.

Liang Jiarui, a high-yield model in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, produced 745 jin of seed cotton per mu on his irrigated high-yield land last year. He applied a total of 9,000 jin of base fertilizer (manure, hay, and soil each accounting for one-third), 150 jin of flaxseed cake, 100 jin of soybean cake, and 100 jin of bone meal, mixed together, and sprinkled after rotting and fermenting, and turned into the soil during the first spring plowing. Topdressing was applied in three times: 15 jin of ammonium sulfate after Xiaoshu (Minor Heat), 12 jin after Dashu (Major Heat), and 7 jin around Liqiu (Autumn Begins). This year, his high-yield land requires a yield of 900 jin of seed cotton per mu, and he plans to apply 9,000 jin of farm manure, 100 jin of soybean cake, 100 jin of cottonseed cake, 100 jin of bone meal, and 20 jin of superphosphate as base fertilizer. Topdressing is applied in three times: the first time at the initial budding stage of the cotton plants, use 50 jin of flaxseed cake and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate; the second time at the initial flowering stage of the cotton plants, use 50 jin of plant ash and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate using the alternate furrow application method; the third time during the full bloom period of the cotton plants, apply 50 jin of plant ash and 10 jin of ammonium sulfate. Cake fertilizers are all applied after fermentation.

The Wulidian State Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, Qu Yaoli, and Liang Jiarui all apply a large amount of farm manure as base fertilizer, or mix fine fertilizer and soil manure as base fertilizer; at the same time, they apply topdressing in stages. Their fertilization methods and timing are basically appropriate. Only Liang Jiarui's third topdressing last year was around Liqiu, which was too late and should be advanced to Dashu.

    棉田施用多少肥料才算适当
    中央人民政府农业部
    棉田施肥必须适当。施肥过多或者过少，都不能达到提高单位面积产量的目的。那末，在棉田施用多少肥料才算适当呢？这要依照各地的土壤成分、灌溉条件等等而定。这里把北京郊区五里店国营农场和山西曲耀离、河北梁家瑞等丰产模范施肥的情况介绍一下，供各地参考。
    今年京郊五里店国营农场的棉田，实行增肥密植。每亩种植四千五百株。该农场今年有八百亩水浇棉田，要求每亩产籽棉五百五十斤，九百亩旱地棉田，要求每亩产籽棉四百五十斤。水浇地每亩施基肥土粪二千斤、棉籽饼二百斤、石灰氮四十斤、过磷酸钙二十斤，这些肥料首先混合成颗粒状，撒于地面，在春耕时翻到地下。追肥每亩用棉籽饼二百斤，在棉株现蕾时和开花时，各施一次，在棉株盛花时，再追施硫酸铵十斤（开沟施在土里）。旱地每亩施基肥土粪二千斤，棉籽饼一百斤、石灰氮四十斤、过磷酸钙二十斤，混合成颗粒状，撒在地面，在开春时用圆盘耙翻到地下。追肥每亩用棉籽饼一百斤，在棉株现蕾时和初花时各施一次，棉株盛花时再施硫酸铵十斤。都是开沟埋在土里。饼肥都是在发酵后施用的。
    山西省丰产模范曲耀离，去年每亩丰产地产籽棉九百一十二斤，基肥共用厩肥（骡、马、羊粪等）一万二千斤，追肥用硫酸铵十六斤，在芒种和夏至左右，分两次施用。今年曲耀离的三亩丰产地，每亩种植三千五百株，计划每亩产籽棉一千斤。共施用基肥六大车（骡、马粪四车，羊粪两车，约一万多斤）、骨粉五十斤，在春耕时翻到地下。还准备用硫酸铵二十斤，分三次施用：芒种左右施一次，半月后施一次，棉株开花时再施一次。每次上追肥后，立即盖土浇水，使肥料很快溶化。
    河北省石家庄丰产模范梁家瑞，去年每亩水田丰产地产籽棉七百四十五斤，共施基肥（粪、禾草、土各占三分之一）九千斤，胡麻饼一百五十斤、黄豆饼一百斤、骨粉一百斤，混合一起，俟腐熟发酵后撒施，在第一次春耕时翻入土内。追肥分三次施用：小暑后用硫酸铵十五斤，大暑后用十二斤，立秋左右用七斤。今年他的丰产地，要求每亩产籽棉九百斤，准备施厩肥九千斤、黄豆饼一百斤、棉籽饼一百斤、骨粉一百斤、过磷酸钙二十斤为基肥。追肥分三次施用：第一次在棉株初蕾时，用胡麻饼五十斤，硫酸铵十斤；第二次在棉株初开花时，用隔垅分施法施草木灰五十斤，硫酸铵十斤；第三次在棉株盛花期，施草木灰五十斤、硫酸铵十斤。饼肥都是发酵后施用的。
    京郊五里店国营农场、曲耀离、梁家瑞都大量施用厩肥作基肥，或以细肥和土粪混合作基肥；同时分期施用追肥。他们的施肥方法和施肥时间，基本上是适当的。只是梁家瑞去年第三次施用追肥，是在立秋左右，为时过晚，应提早到大暑时施用。
