    Pengze County Launches Mass Cotton Field Appraisal Campaign
    Everyone Agrees That Wu Xuanwen's Cotton Seedlings Grow Best
    In order to promote the patriotic production increase movement, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, is universally carrying out mass cotton field inspections and appraisals. The county production office first issued appraisal outlines to various districts and townships, and mobilized various mutual aid groups to discuss the appraisal work. Then, the leaders sent ten mutual aid groups that challenged Wu Xuanwen's mutual aid group to inspect and appraise the cotton fields of Wu Xuanwen's mutual aid group in Furong Township, the county's cotton high-yield area, on May 24, as the first step in launching an appraisal campaign throughout the county. They held meetings in the fields to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each cotton field; then they held a general appraisal meeting to assess who was good and who was bad, how to learn from the good, how to remedy the bad, and what issues to pay attention to in the future. Everyone unanimously agreed that Wu Xuanwen's cotton seedlings were the best: they grew neatly, the spacing was appropriate, the leaves were green, and the stems were thick; the soil was deeply plowed and finely harrowed; the ridges were good and the ditches were deep for easy drainage; the fertilizer was properly mixed; and the thinning was timely. Next to the land cultivated by Wu Xuanwen's mutual aid group was the cotton field of Lei Zecai, an individual farmer. This field was far inferior to the mutual aid group's field, the seedlings did not grow well, and many weeds grew. Now Lei Zecai is requesting to join Wu Xuanwen's mutual aid group. Everyone praised Wu Xuanwen's cotton field and unanimously expressed their desire to learn from Wu Xuanwen. After inspecting the cotton fields of five mutual aid groups in Furong Township, everyone believed that these mutual aid groups had basically completed their production plans in the spring and that a bumper harvest was guaranteed. The inspection also revealed that a small number of cotton fields did not meet the standards, mainly because the cotton seedlings were too sparse or missing, the ridges were not well made, the drainage ditches were too shallow, and some fields had too much bean cake fertilizer but no phosphate fertilizer, etc. At the appraisal meeting, everyone pointed out these shortcomings and also suggested remedies. The mutual aid groups that were inspected and the mutual aid groups and farmers with the same shortcomings all stated that they would revise and supplement their production plans. The inspection revealed that some mutual aid groups did not pay attention to production plans and did not strictly follow the plans; such mutual aid groups were determined to make up for the areas that had not been done as much as possible.
    This inspection and appraisal broke the conservative thinking of some farmers. For example, Tang Changhuai's conservative thinking was very serious, and he stubbornly refused to believe that Wu Xuanwen harvested more than 800 jin of cotton per mu last year. This year, he said angrily, "If Wu Xuanwen can harvest 1,000 jin, so can I!" But he still followed his old methods: leaving only more than 600 seedlings per mu; applying too much fertilizer when sowing, as if throwing the cotton seeds into a manure pit. Because the thinning was delayed and no attention was paid to pest control, the cotton seedlings grew very thin and there were many insects. The ridges were not well made, and the bone meal was not well applied and was exposed on the ground. Before seeing Wu Xuanwen's cotton, he was still very happy, thinking that his cotton seedlings were tall and not inferior to those. After this appraisal, he regretted it. At the appraisal meeting, he said, "Don't blame anyone else, just blame my stubborn mind for not accepting advanced experience. In the future, I must listen to the government, accept scientific and technological guidance, and learn from Wu Xuanwen."
    At the appraisal meeting, everyone also exchanged experiences in leading mutual aid groups and in cotton field cultivation and fertilization, and all felt that they had gained a lot. Now the county is carrying out a mutual visit, inspection, and appraisal campaign between townships and townships, groups and groups, and households and households.

    彭泽县开展群众性的棉田评比运动
    大家一致认为吴宣文的棉苗长得最好
    为了推进爱国丰产运动，江西省彭泽县正在普遍进行群众性的棉田检查和评比。县生产办公室先向各区乡发出评比提纲，发动各互助组讨论了评比工作。然后领导向吴宣文互助组应战的十个互助组，在五月二十四日到全县棉花丰产区芙蓉乡检查评比吴宣文互助组的棉田，作为在全县开展评比运动的第一步。他们在地头开会，评出每块棉田的优缺点；然后召开总的评比会，评比谁好谁坏，好的怎样学习，坏的怎样补救，今后注意哪些问题。大家一致认为，吴宣文的棉苗最好：长得整齐，距离合适，叶青茎肥；泥土耕得深耙得细；畦好沟深便于排水；肥料配合得当；间苗及时。吴宣文互助组耕地的旁边，是单干户雷着才的棉田。这块田比起互助组的棉田差远了，苗长得不好，生了许多草。现在雷着才正要求参加吴宣文互助组。看了吴宣文的棉田，人人称赞，一致表示要向吴宣文学习。检查了芙蓉乡的五个互助组的棉田之后，大家都认为他们这几个互助组在春季基本上完成了生产计划，丰产是有把握的。在检查中也发现有少数棉田不合标准，主要是棉苗太稀或缺苗，畦做得不好，水沟挖得太浅，有的地豆饼下得太多，但没有下磷肥等。在评比会上，大家指出这些缺点，也指出了补救的办法。被检查的互助组和有同样缺点的互助组和农民，都表示回去要重新修订补充生产计划。检查中发现有的互助组不重视生产计划，没有严格按照计划做；这样的互助组决心把没作到的地方尽量补上。
    这次检查评比，打破了有些农民的保守思想。如汤昌怀保守思想很严重，硬不相信吴宣文去年一亩地收八百多斤棉花。今年他赌气说：“吴宣文能收一千斤，我也能！”可是他还是按他的老法子办：一亩地只留六百多棵苗；播种时施肥太多，像把棉籽丢在粪窖里一样。因为间苗间得迟，没有注意防治虫害，棉苗长得很瘦，虫很多。畦做得不好，骨粉也没下好，露在地面。来看吴宣文的棉花以前，他还很高兴，认为自己的棉苗长得高，不比那个差。经过这次评比，他才后悔了。在评比会上，他说：“不怪别的，就怪我这死脑筋，不接受先进经验。今后我一定要听政府的话，接受科学技术指导，向吴宣文学习。”
    在评比会上，大家还交流了领导互助组的经验，和棉田耕作、施肥的经验，都认为收获很大。现在全县正开展乡和乡、组和组、户和户的互相参观、检查、评比运动。（中共江西省彭泽县委员会）
