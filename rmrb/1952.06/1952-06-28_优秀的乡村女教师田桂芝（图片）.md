    (Sixteen) Tian Guizhi said: "There are no backward masses. If you see the masses as backward, it only shows that your work has not been done well, and you have not understood, organized, or educated them." Wang Fengjiang, the "backward" cadre in the village, also participated in night school learning with the encouragement of the masses and Tian Guizhi's patient help. His thinking was transformed, and he later became a popular cadre in the village.
    (Seventeen) Some women had difficulties and were not enthusiastic about learning. On rainy days, Tian Guizhi picked them up, and after school, she sent them home. Later, she came up with the idea of ​​"bedside study groups," asking elementary school students to be teachers and go to the women's homes to teach them.
    (Eighteen) During the busy farming season, the villagers could not attend classes on time, so Tian Guizhi came up with a new method of segmented classes. Classes were held once or twice a week, and homework was left for them, allowing everyone to discuss it while working and then write it out when they got home. In this way, Yongsheng Village was filled with a learning atmosphere, which greatly encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for labor.

    （十六）田桂芝说：“没有落后的群众。如果你看到群众落后，那正说明你的工作没有做好，你没去了解、组织、教育他们。屯里“落后”干部王凤江在群众的鼓励和田桂芝的耐心帮助下，也参加了夜校学习，思想得到了改造，后来成为屯里呱呱叫的干部。
    （十七）有些妇女有困难，对学习不热心。雨天，田桂芝去接她们，放学时又送她们回家。后来她又想出炕头小组的办法，叫小学生当先生，到妇女家里去教她们。
    （十八）农忙时，老乡不能按时上课，田桂芝又想出分段上课的新办法。一星期上一两次课，留功课给他们，让大家在干活时讨论，回家再写出来。这样一来，永胜屯便充满了学习空气，大大鼓舞了大家的劳动热情。
