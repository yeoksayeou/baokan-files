Five Seas Navigation
By Bolei Wo Yi, Soviet Union

Editor's Note: This article by Bolei Wo Yi was specially written for this newspaper to celebrate the successful completion of the world's first communist construction project, the Volga-Don Canal. Bolei Wo Yi conducted long-term dedicated interviews during the construction of the Volga-Don Canal and continuously published many communications about the Volga-Don Canal in "Pravda." Bolei Wo Yi's book "A Real Man" was translated into Chinese long ago. This book made him one of the Soviet writers well-known to Chinese readers.

At the end of last year, I gave a report to intellectuals in London on the great communist construction projects being undertaken in the Soviet Union. So many people wanted to hear this report that the meeting had to be moved from a small room to a spacious hall to barely accommodate those who were very interested in the report. The report lasted 45 minutes, but the question-and-answer session lasted two and a half hours.

All of this is very noteworthy. It shows that the brilliant, clear, and invincible truth of our socialist life breaks through the lies and slanders that the so-called "Great" Britain's press spreads every day. It shows that ordinary people, even intellectuals in an imperialist country like Britain, pay attention to, are enthusiastically interested in, and are excited about the great construction work now being carried out in our socialist world, regardless of the mad cries of neo-fascist American propaganda or all kinds of strange noises, and regard our peaceful labor and the creative achievements of our people as the bright future of mankind.

The people who came to listen to the report had different worldviews. One of them, in terms of belief, was a conservative; in terms of specialized skills, he was an engineer. It is said that he is not only one of the best hydraulic engineering experts in Britain but also in the entire capitalist Europe. He said very frankly:

"What we hear here is like a myth. But there is always an insurmountable distance between myth and reality. I don't believe that such a construction project can be carried out at the current level of technology, especially under the current international situation, and completed within the time limit announced by the Soviet government. It is truly unimaginable."

Now, as the first communist construction built according to the large-scale Stalin Plan is completed within the time limit set by the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, I am reminded of these words. Such a construction, with its brilliant design, unprecedented scale, and extremely humane purpose, is indeed completely unimaginable in the capitalist world shrouded in war psychosis. But what is completely unimaginable for them is commonplace for the people of our Soviet country. The great victory of communist construction, the opening of the canal connecting the five seas of the Soviet Union, proves this clearly and unshakably.

To connect the Volga and Don rivers, our two major rivers, has been a long-standing dream of our capable and hardworking people. This dream has lived for hundreds of years in the songs and myths that tell of Mother Volga and Father Don meeting. But only in our Soviet era, only in the magnificent days of unprecedented creative labor—days we Soviet people call the Stalin era—was this centuries-old dream finally realized.

The great Chinese people, who have victoriously completed the feat of liberating the motherland and are now engaged in the great work of transforming the national economy, are particularly able to understand and appreciate the full significance of the work we Soviet people have just completed. Please look at the vast map of the Soviet Union. Find the closest point between the Volga River, the largest river in Europe, and the Don River. Here, the Volga-Don Navigation Canal now runs through the grasslands, across the hills, and over the watershed, setting a course of 101 kilometers in length. From now on, the five seas that wash the shores of our motherland—the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea—have been forever connected to each other through convenient inland river transportation. A direct waterway has been opened through our country—from the Arctic to the subtropics.

The geographical location of this new canal alone explains its great significance to the national economy. Even in our country, which is famous for large-scale water conservancy projects, even among the huge constructions such as the Dnieper River Hydropower Project, the Moscow Canal, and the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal, the Volga-Don Canal occupies a special position. The constructions I have mentioned basically solve one task, namely, the task of power or transportation. However, this new canal, the newborn of communist construction, solves three tasks at once: transportation, power, and irrigation. Since the Volga-Don Canal is the great passage of the five seas of the Soviet Union and a powerful source of power for industry, irrigation systems, and agricultural electrification, it also serves the great cause of transforming nature that our Soviet people are engaged in.

The vast territories in the southeast, which are famous for their fertile soil but have been threatened by drought and dry winds since ancient times, are now receiving a large amount of revived moisture, rationally sent to the fields by the creative will of man. In the southwestern part of the Stalingrad region, 150,000 hectares of land are irrigated, and 1 million hectares of land have water supply. In the Rostov region, 600,000 hectares of land will be irrigated, and 1 million hectares of land will have water supply. In this way, the Soviet farmers in southeastern Russia, whose labor was always threatened by drought and vicious dry winds in the past, are now forever free from it.

The basic intention of this powerful newborn of communist construction, the Volga-Don Canal, is to solve this trinity of tasks, which is extremely humane in content, very bold in intention, and large in scale.

Last year, when the construction work was in full swing, I, as a writer, was fortunate enough to spend the summer here. On this great route of the dry grassland, which was still saline land at that time, locks, dams, pumping stations, breakwaters, and lighthouses were being built.

For a creative person, this is a happy journey in the communist world of tomorrow, in the world of buildings that have never existed on our old planet, in the world of future technology—huge, intelligent, sophisticated technology that is completely subject to the creative will of the staff.

We were already surprised before we reached the construction site. In the grassland in front of us, like a separate mountain range, a huge embankment made of earth was revealed, 35 meters high and even larger in diameter. It seemed that such an embankment could never be created by human power. This cliff protruding from the ground was the result of some geographical change. In fact, no large group of people could be seen on the embankment anyway. Two rows of thick pipes with supports extended above the embankment. Dense and turbid sewage was discharged from the mouths of these pipes. A few people were walking slowly along these pipes. That was all!

It turned out that below, in the riverbed of the Don River, a whole team of suction dredgers managed by only a small group of people was parked. These seemingly clumsy ships were selecting large amounts of sand and soil in this quarry, mixing it with water, and then sending it into the pipes and piling it on top of the high embankment.

Now that this embankment has been built, and the waves of the newborn Tsimlyansk Sea have splashed onto its paved slopes, some information about its birth can be reported. This huge foundation, 12.8 kilometers long, was completed in one year with the power of suction machines. If a large number of diggers were used, it would take 10 to 12 years to build.

To realize the great construction of the Volga-Don Canal, a large amount of concrete, an unprecedented amount, was needed. I was told that this concrete was manufactured by 16 cement plants working for this construction project, using automated mechanical equipment. If you have not visited such a factory and seen its technical equipment, it will still be difficult to imagine this unusual enterprise.

Visiting such a cement plant in the Tsimlyansk Hydropower Station construction area was a special trip for me in the technical world of tomorrow, the communist future. The factories we visited stood above the entire construction site. They worked day and night. Powerful "MA3" brand trucks carrying cement, each carrying seven tons of concrete, formed a continuous line, maintaining an average interval, and driving from the factory to the dams and locks day and night. This mobile conveyor belt composed of trucks was three kilometers long. These three interconnected factories could turn several trains of cement, gravel, and sand into liquid concrete in one day and one night, and then pour it out in large quantities. In these three factories, there were dozens of complex machines, conveyor belts, giant cranes, and mixing machines, but only one person, an engineer on duty sitting in front of a huge electrical control panel, managed it. He observed the entire work process from various light bulbs without taking a step out of the room; he twisted electrical switches and directed the entire work of the three factories. This huge production complex seemed to me to be a huge, complex steel organism, and this tiny but infinitely powerful man was the brain that commanded the various functions of this organism.

The high degree of mechanization of concrete, steel frames, and various construction works enabled us to place 8,000 cubic meters of concrete into the building in one day, and on the eve of our great National Day, November 6 last year, we created an unprecedented record of 12,499 cubic meters.

Finally, let's talk about the huge excavators that played such a big role in building this great route. I remember when we flew to this construction site, we asked the chief engineer to send us to the place where the biggest work was going on. We went to the watershed of the Volga-Don Canal, where the builders had to open a very wide gap in a high ground. I had seen the construction of the Moscow Canal and visited canal construction sites abroad. Of course, I thought I would see tens of thousands of people at such a great project.

How surprised I was when I couldn't see a single person. A huge grassland warrior—an "ЭЩ—14—65" type excavator was digging a large amount of soil. Its bucket could hold 14 cubic meters of soil at a time, and the 65-meter-long steel rod lifted them high, sent them more than 100 meters away from the excavation site, and then threw them onto the slope that looked like a mountain range.

This huge machine, which performs the work of tens of thousands of diggers, is managed by an excavator team of only five people.

Hundreds of Soviet excavators of various brands are undertaking the main work. Among them, the "ЭЩ—1" type small mobile excavators and the electric crawler excavators that can hold three cubic meters of soil per bucket occupy the main position. Teams of suction dredgers, hundreds of ordinary bulldozers and crawler bulldozers, thousands of dump trucks, and dozens of multi-bucket excavators are helping them. These machines are following behind the excavators, as if they are combing the inclined canal bank.

Walking through the various places of this construction project, I saw the great victory of Soviet technology and remembered the wise words that Stalin said as early as 1931: "...If we think that we can support our construction speed and production scale without implementing mechanization, it is equivalent to hoping to suck up all the seawater with a spoon." The Soviet people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, because they remembered these words of the great leader, created powerful, unprecedented technology in the world; and this technology, with all its power, greatly helped us solve the task of communist construction on an unprecedented scale.

The people we met on our canal trip, the builders we knew and made friends with, also surprised us greatly. These are our compatriots, ordinary Soviet people. But when working on construction projects of this design scale that mankind has never seen before, when working on these machines that Soviet industry supplies them with that mankind has never seen before, when applying the latest achievements of Soviet science to practice, they, these people, seem to have transcended the times and have learned to live and think according to communist standards.

A large number of such people walked past us. Everywhere we saw a remarkable phenomenon that was very illustrative of the characteristics of this construction—complex and flexible machines eliminated physical labor. The staff managing these machines are workers from special practical technologies. People sometimes feel that their knowledge is not enough. Although the progress of these construction works and the whole life is very rapid, these builders still find free time to study in middle schools and technical schools, participate in middle school graduation exams, and strive for technical certificates.

I said at the beginning of this article that this newborn of communist construction—the Volga-Don Canal—solved three great tasks, but in addition to these three, this construction project also solved a fourth task that is almost equally important. It is a special laboratory, a "shooting range" for testing new large-scale technologies, for other larger-scale constructions that the great Soviet people are now carrying out on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, and the Amu Darya. The valuable experience accumulated by the builders of the Volga-Don Canal will greatly help the builders of other constructions…

I am glad to tell all this to the great free Chinese citizens who are planning and carrying out construction work unprecedented in this ancient country. Your ancestors once built the Great Wall, one of the amazing buildings in the world's architectural technology. You, the free Chinese people, who are so successfully subduing the mighty and unruly Huai River under the leadership of the Communist Party, I believe that you will feel happy and pleased to know about the victory of the builders of the Volga-Don Canal.

And we Soviet people, together with the builders, regard the day of the completion of the great new water route of the Five Seas as our common festival.

This is a great new victory won under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. This is a victory of peace. This is a victory of communism.

    五海通航
    苏联  波列伏依
    编者按：波列伏依此文是应本报特约为庆祝世界第一个共产主义建设工程伏尔加—顿运河的胜利完成而写的。在伏尔加—顿运河的建设过程中，波列伏依曾经进行长期的专门的采访，并在“真理报”连续发表许多篇关于伏尔加—顿运河的通讯。波列伏依所著“真正的人”一书早有中文译本。这书使他在中国成为广大读者所熟知的苏联作家之一。
    去年年底，我给伦敦城的知识分子作了一次关于苏联进行共产主义伟大建设工程的报告。希望听这个报告的人非常之多，以至报告会不得不从一个不大的房子迁到一所宽敞的大厅去举行，才勉强地把那些对报告很有兴致的人容纳下来。报告历时四十五分钟，可是提问题的时间却有两个半钟头。
    所有这一切是很值得注意的。这说明了我们社会主义生活的光辉明朗的、能战胜一切的真实，突破了所谓“大”不列颠的报刊每天散布出来的谎话和诽谤。这说明了普通的人们，甚至就是像英国这样一个帝国主义国家的知识分子，也不顾新法西斯的美国宣传的疯狂叫嚣或各种各样的怪叫，而注意地、兴致勃勃地、兴奋地注意着现在正在我们社会主义世界中进行的伟大建设工作，并且把我们的和平劳动，把我国人民的创造性的伟绩看作是人类的光辉的未来。
    来听报告的人，有着各种不同的世界观，其中有一个人就信仰而论是保守分子；就专门技能而论是工程师。据说他不仅是英国的，而且也是整个资本主义欧洲最出色的水利工程专家之一。他非常坦白地说道：
    “我们在这里听到的，真像一个神话。但在神话和现实之间总是有一段不可征服的距离。我不相信在现代的技术水平上，尤其是在现在的国际情势之下，能够进行这样的建设工程，而且在苏联政府所宣布的期限内完成。这真是不可想像的。”
    现在，当根据规模宏大的斯大林计划建设起来的第一个共产主义建设，在布尔什维克党和苏联政府规定的期限内完成的时候，我想起了这一段话。这种设计英明、规模空前而且目的又极为人道的建设，在战争精神病笼罩之下的资本主义世界，的确是完全不可想像的。但他们完全不可想像的事情，对于我们苏维埃国家的人来说，则是日常的东西。共产主义建设的伟大的胜利，连结苏联五个海的大运河的通航，显明地和不可动摇地证明了这一点。
    把伏尔加河和顿河这两条我国的大河连接起来，是我们的能干和热爱劳动的人民长久以来的梦想。这个梦想是好几百年来就活在那些讲伏尔加妈妈和顿河爸爸会面的歌谣和神话中的。但是只有在我们苏维埃时代，只有在空前的创造性的劳动高潮的雄伟的日子里，——我们苏维埃人称为斯大林时代的日子里，这个几百年来的梦想才最后实现了。
    胜利完成了解放祖国的丰功伟绩而现在又进行着改造国民经济这个伟大工作的伟大的中国人民，是特别能够理解和评价我们苏维埃人刚刚完成的工作的全部意义的。请看那苏联国土广大无边的地图。请找那条欧洲最大的河流伏尔加河和顿河最接近的地方。在这里，伏尔加—顿通航运河现在通过草原，穿过山岗和分水岭，定下了全长一百零一公里的路线。从今以后，冲洗着我们祖国海岸的五个海——白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海及黑海，已经由于有了便利的内河交通而彼此永远连结起来了。穿过我们全国——从北极地带到亚热带，开辟了一条直通船舶的交通线。
    这条新运河的地理位置，本身就已说明了它在国民经济上的伟大意义。甚至在我们这个以大规模水利建设出名的国家中，甚至在像第聂泊河水电工程、莫斯科运河、白海——波罗的海运河等类的巨大建设当中，伏尔加—顿这条运河也占着特殊的地位。我所举出的这些建设，基本上是解决一项任务，就是动力或运输的任务。然而这条新的运河，这个共产主义建设的初生儿，却一举而解决了三项任务，这就是运输的、动力的和灌溉的任务。伏尔加—顿运河既然是苏联五个海的伟大通路，既然是工业、灌溉系统和农业电气化的强大电力泉源，因此同时也就是为我们苏联人民所从事的改造自然的伟大事业服务。
    东南部分的广大领土，是以其土壤之富饶出名的，但自古以来就遭受着旱灾和干风的威胁，现在这一带地区却得到了大量复苏的、由人的创造性意志合理地送到田野里来的水分。在斯大林格勒州西南一带地区，有十五万公顷土地受到灌溉，一百万公顷土地有水供应。在罗斯多夫州将有六十万公顷土地受到灌溉，一百万公顷土地有水供应。这样，东南俄罗斯的苏维埃农民，他们的劳动过去总是受到旱灾和凶恶的干风的威胁，现在是永远摆脱了。
    这个共产主义建设的强大的初生儿，伏尔加—顿运河的基本意图，就是要解决这个三位一体的、内容极为人道的、意图非常大胆的和规模宏大的任务。
    去年建设工作正紧张进行的时候，作为一位作家的我，很幸运地在这里度过了夏天。在这条当时还是盐土地带的干燥草原的伟大路线上，正在修建闸门、堤坝、抽水站、防波堤和灯塔。
    对于一个从事创作的人来说，这是在明天的共产主义世界里，在我们这个旧星球还不曾有过的那些建筑物的世界里，在未来技术——巨大的、智慧的、精细的、完全服从工作人员的创造意志的技术——的世界里的一次幸福的旅行。
    我们还没有到达这个建设工程跟前的时候，已经感觉到吃惊了。在我们面前的草原上，好像是分出来的一条山脉一样，显露着巨大的泥土堆成的堤坝，高度有三十五公尺，直径还要大。看起来，这样的堤坝决不是人力所能创造出来的，这个从地面上凸出来的断崖，是某种地理变化的结果。事实上，无论如何是看不见堤坝上有大群的人的。堤坝上面伸出两排有支架撑着的粗管子。浓密而浑浊的污水从这些管子的口中送出来。几个人沿着这些管子不急不忙地走着。如此而已！
    原来在下面，在顿河的河床里，停着一整队只有一小组人管理的吸土船。这些表面显得很笨的船只，正在这个采石场上挑选着大量的沙土，拌和着水以后就把它们送到管子里，堆到高高的堤坝上面。
    现在，当这个堤坝已经修建起来，而且新生的齐姆良海的浪花已经溅到它那铺着砖石的斜坡上来的时候，可以报道一些关于它的诞生的材料了。这个长达十二点八公里的巨大堤基，是依靠吸土机器的力量在一年内完成的。如果用大批掘土工人，得十年至十二年才能修筑起来。
    为了使伏尔加—顿运河的伟大建设实现，需要用大量的、为数空前的混凝土。人们告诉我，这些混凝土是由十六个为这项建设事业工作的水泥厂，以自动化的机械设备制造出来的。如果没有访问过这样的工厂，没有看过它的技术设备，仍然会很难想像这种不平常的企业。
    在齐姆良水利站建设区访问这样的水泥厂，对于我来说，乃是在明天的、共产主义未来的技术世界中作了一次特殊的旅行我们访问的一批工厂，屹立在整个建筑场上面。它们日夜不停地工作着，威力强大的运载水泥的“MA3”牌汽车，每辆可以载七吨混凝土，它们结成一条不断的行列，保持着平均的间隔，不分昼夜地从工厂开往堤坝和闸门。这种用汽车组成的活动传送带，拖了三公里长。这三家联结在一起的工厂，一天一夜就可以把好几列车的洋灰、石子和沙土变成液体混凝土，然后大量倾泻出来。在这三家工厂中工作的，有几十部复杂的机器、输送带、巨型天秤、调配机，但只有一个人，一个坐在巨大的电气控制台面前的值班工程师在管理它，他从各种灯泡观察全部工作的进程。他一步也不走出房间，按着无数的电钮；他扭着电气开关，指挥着三个厂的全部工作。这个巨大的生产综合设备，在我看来是一个巨大的、复杂的钢铁有机体，而这个渺小但具有无限威力的人，就是这个有机体的指挥各种机能的脑子。
    混凝土、钢架以及各种建筑工作这样高度的机械化，使我们能在一天之内把八千立方公尺的混凝土安置到建筑物里面，而在去年十一月六日，我们的伟大的国庆节前夜，又创造了空前未有的纪录——一万二千四百九十九立方公尺。
    最后，谈谈在修建这条伟大航路中起了那么大作用的巨大的掘土机罢。记得飞到这个建设场所的时候，我们要求总工程师送我们到那个正在进行最大的工作的地方。我们去到伏尔加—顿运河的分水岭，那里建设者们必须在一处高地开一个很宽的缺口。我看过莫斯科运河的修建工作，到过国外运河建设的地方，当然我以为会在这种伟大工程的地方看到成千成万的人。
    当我连一个人也看不到的时候，我是多么惊奇呵。一个巨大的草原勇士——“ЭЩ—14—65”式掘土机正在大量地掘土。它的槽斗一下就可以装十四立方公尺的土，六十五公尺长的钢杆把它们高高举起，送到离挖掘地点一百余公尺的地方，再抛到看来好像山脉似的坡上。
    这个执行几万名掘土工人的工作的庞大机器，是由只有五个人组成的掘土机小组管理的。
    几百部苏联各种牌子的掘土机担任着主要的工作。其中占主要地位的，是“ЭЩ—1”式小型移动掘土机和每槽斗能容三立方公尺土的电动履带掘土机。成队的吸土船，几百部普通铲土机和履带式铲土机，几千辆自卸卡车，几十部多斗掘土机都在帮助它们。这些机器跟在掘土机后面，好像是在梳理倾斜的运河河岸。
    在这项建设工程的各个地方走过的时候，我看到了苏联技术的极大的胜利，并且想起斯大林早在一九三一年所说过的英明的话：“……如果以为我们不必实行机械化，便能支持我们的建设速度和生产规模，那就等于希望可用匙子吸尽海水了。”在布尔什维克党领导下的苏联人民，由于记住了伟大领袖的这几句话，所以创造了强大的、世界上空前未有的技术；而这种技术又以自己的全部威力大大地帮助我们解决规模空前的共产主义建设的任务。
    我们在运河旅行的时候，我们所遇见的那些人，我们认识并且作了朋友的那些建设者们，也使我们感到很大的惊讶。这是我们的同胞，是普通平凡的
    苏维埃人。但在这种为人类所未曾看到过的设计规模的建设事业上工作的时候，在苏联工业供给他们的这些人类还未曾见过的机器上工作的时候，在把苏联科学上的最新成就运用到实际中来的时候，他们，就是这些人，好像是超越了时代，已经学会以
    共产主义的标准来生活和思考了。
        一大批这样的人从我们眼前走过去。在任何地方我们都看见一个显著的、很能说明这种建设的特征的现象——复杂而灵活的机器，排除了体力劳动。管理这种机器的工作人员，是出身于特殊的实用技术的工人。人们有时候感觉到自己的知识不够。虽然这些建设工作和全部生活的进度是很迅速的，但这些建设者仍然找得到空闲时间去中学校、技术专科学校里学习，参加中学毕业考试，争取技术证书。
    我在这篇文章的开头已经说过，这个共产主义建设的初生儿——伏尔加—顿运河解决了三项伟大的任务，但除了这三项以外，这个建设事业也解决了第四个差不多同等重要的任务。它是一个特殊的实验所，对于考验新的大规模技术来说，对于伟大苏联人民现在正在伏尔加河、第聂伯河和阿姆河进行的规模更大的其他建设来说，它是一个“打靶场”。伏尔加—顿运河的建设者们所累积起来的宝贵经验，会给其他各个建设的建设者们以不小的帮助……
    我高兴把所有这一切告诉计划了并正在全国进行着为这个古国所空前未有的建设工作的伟大的自由的中国公民们。你们的祖先曾经修建了世界建筑技术上惊人建筑物之一的万里长城。你们，在共产党领导下如此顺利地制服着强大而不驯服的淮河的自由的中国人，我相信你们知道了伏尔加—顿运河的建设者们的胜利，是会感到高兴和愉快的。
    而我们苏维埃人，也和建设者们一起，把伟大的五海的水上新道路完成的日子，看作是我们共同的节日。
    这是在布尔什维克党领导下所赢得的伟大的新胜利。这是和平的胜利。这是共产主义的胜利。
