American imperialism, which is attempting to dominate the world, is running amok like a mad dog in order to find a way out of the dead end of its deeply frustrated policies of aggression. The peace and security of the Asian and Pacific region, like that of Europe and the Atlantic region, is being seriously threatened by American imperialism.

    In order to occupy Japan for a long time and intensify the arming of Japan, the United States, disregarding the opposition of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region, signed a separate "peace treaty" with Japan, as well as the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," and announced on April 28th of this year that these treaties had "come into effect." As a result, Japan has become the center of American aggression and a military base in the Far East. The United States controls fourteen important naval ports in Japan and has built more than fifty air force bases. Under the support of the American occupation forces, Japanese militarism is being revived. Under the guise of "Police Reserve Force" and "Maritime Safety Force," the Japanese army will be expanded to 250,000 men, and the Japanese navy will have ships totaling 250,000 tons. More than 100,000 Japanese militarists, including many important war criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region, have been illegally released and purged, and have infiltrated political and military institutions to assume important positions. The Japanese economy is being led onto the path of a war economy, and military production is expanding. A fascist system aimed at suppressing the Japanese people and clearing the way for rearmament is being restored.

    American imperialism, with Japan as its pivot, has established a huge network of military bases in the Pacific. This base network extends from Alaska, through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, to Thailand. The United States has also established dense military bases on other islands in the Pacific.

    American imperialism, with Japan as its center, has carried out a series of arrangements for preparing aggressive wars in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Before and after the signing of the illegal separate "peace treaty" with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," the United States also signed the "US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Philippine government, and the "ANZUS Security Treaty" with the governments of Australia and New Zealand. The United States is attempting to use these two treaties to bind the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand to the American war chariot. At the beginning of this year, the United States also gathered the chiefs of staff of Britain and France for secret meetings to plan the expansion of aggressive activities in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it instructed the Japanese reactionary government to conclude a so-called "treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. These facts prove that American imperialism is plotting to establish a "Pacific Group" in the Far East similar to the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" in order to collect cannon fodder and piece together an invading army.

    American imperialism, relying on its bases in Japan, brazenly launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the Truman government issued a statement that undermined peace in the Far East and provoked aggression, and even sent its Seventh Fleet to openly invade and occupy our country's Taiwan. American imperialism has sent a military advisory group to Saigon, accelerating the shipment of arms to the French invading army in Vietnam, while strengthening its control over the Philippines. This marks the transformation of American aggression in the Far East and Southeast Asia from aiding various reactionary factions to open armed intervention.

    The American aggressors, who suffered a decisive defeat on the Korean battlefield, have recently used bacteriological weapons with utter inhumanity. The American aggressors continue to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice talks, so that the armistice agreement has not been reached and peace in Korea has not been restored.

    On the American continent on the east coast of the Pacific, the United States first turned Canada into its own naval and air force base, with the US military carrying out military conspiracies in northern Canada. As early as 1947, American imperialism signed the "Rio Treaty" with the reactionary governments of Latin American countries. This treaty stipulates that they must support American wars of aggression. Recently, the United States, based on the so-called "Mutual Security Act" that interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, is separately concluding so-called "bilateral military agreements" with the rulers of Latin American countries in order to drive the people of Latin American countries to be sacrifices in wars of aggression.

    Another aspect of American war policy is the frantic implementation of economic monopoly and plunder against the people of various countries. Under the guise of the US-Canada "Post-War Cooperation" agreement, Canadian industry has become an appendage of American military production. American monopoly capital controls almost all iron sand production in Latin America, more than nine-tenths of the copper, and more than half of the oil. Latin America supplies one-third of America's total imports, most of which are strategic raw materials. American monopoly capital penetrates Japan and Southeast Asia without any gaps, extracting huge profits and seizing rubber and tin ore from Malaya, manganese and copper from the Philippines, oil and bauxite from Indonesia, forests from Thailand, non-ferrous metals from Burma, and resources from other countries. American imperialism is also attempting to cut off the natural economic ties between these regions and New China through "blockades" and "embargoes." This economic plunder and reactionary measures by the United States are causing the peaceful economies of many countries in the Asian and Pacific region to decline and go bankrupt, and the living standards of the people of these countries are declining day by day.

    Within the United States, the Truman government is frantically expanding its military and preparing for war. The total amount of US military expenditure for the 1950-51 fiscal year reached 65 billion US dollars. The 1951-52 fiscal year saw an unprecedentedly large increase to 81.8 billion US dollars. In the first year after the outbreak of the Korean War, American military institutions and monopoly capitalists signed military order contracts worth 42 billion US dollars. In the two budget years of 1950-51 and 1951-52, the US government planned to issue military orders worth 87 billion US dollars.

    However, the war policy of American imperialism has met with strong opposition from the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific region. The defeat of the American aggressors in Korea has declared their defeat in the Asian and Pacific region. The Chinese and Korean People's Forces have tolled the death knell of the era of American aggressors' tyranny. In Japan, which serves as an important American military base, and in Southeast Asia, and in Latin America, which serves as an important supplier of American strategic raw materials, a powerful movement to defend peace and fight for freedom is flourishing. As Malenkov pointed out in 1949: "The national liberation struggle in Asian countries, the Pacific coastal regions, and the entire colonial world has risen to a new and much higher stage." The conspiracy of American imperialism to enslave the people of the Asian and Pacific region and drag them into war is doomed to failure.

    Recently, eleven prominent figures in our country who are working for peace, representing the will of our people, initiated the convening of the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." This is an event of great significance and encouragement for the peace-loving people of the Asian and Pacific region, and has therefore been enthusiastically responded to and supported by them. The people of the Asian and Pacific region will unite even more closely and fight to defend peace and security, to strive for national independence, to improve the economic lives of the people of all countries, and to promote cultural exchanges.

### 美帝国主义严重威胁亚洲及太平洋区域的和平

    美帝国主义严重威胁亚洲及太平洋区域的和平
    妄图统治全世界的美帝国主义，为了从已经遭受严重挫败的侵略政策的死胡同里寻找出路，正像疯狗一样到处乱闯。亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全，正和欧洲及大西洋区域一样，遭到美帝国主义的严重威胁。
    美国为了长期占领日本和加紧武装日本，不顾亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的反对，签订了单独对日
    “和约”、以及美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”，并于今年四月二十八日宣布这些条约“生效”。日本因此已变为美国在远东的侵略中心和军事基地。美国控制着日本十四个重要军港，并修建空军基地五十余处。在美国占领军的扶植下，日本的军国主义正在复活。在“警察后备队”和“海上保安队”等名义掩盖下，日本陆军将扩充到二十五万人，日本海军拥有的舰艇将增到二十五万吨。十余万日本军国主义分子，包括双手染满亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民鲜血的许多重要战犯，已被非法释放和解除整肃，并潜入政治和军事机构中担任要职。日本经济被导入战争经济的轨道，军事生产正在扩大。旨在镇压日本人民而为重新武装扫清道路的法西斯制度，正在恢复。
    美帝国主义以日本为枢纽，在太平洋上建立了一个庞大的军事基地网。这个基地网从阿拉斯加起，经过阿留申群岛、日本、台湾、菲律宾、越南，直伸到泰国。美国在太平洋其他岛屿上也建立了密布的军事基地。
    美帝国主义以日本为中心，在东南亚和太平洋区域进行了一连串准备侵略战争的布置。在非法的单独对日“和约”及美日“安全条约”签订前后，美国又和菲律宾政府签订了“美菲联防条约”，和澳大利亚、新西兰政府签订了“美澳新三边安全条约”。美国企图用这两个条约把菲、澳、新三国缚在美国战车上。今年年初，美国又纠集英法两国的参谋长开秘密会议，策划在东南亚扩大侵略活动。同时指使日本反动政府和台湾的蒋介石匪帮订立所谓“和约”。这些事实证明，美帝国主义阴谋在远东建立类似“北大西洋公约”的“太平洋集团”，以便搜罗炮灰，拼凑侵略军。
    美帝国主义以日本基地为依托，在一九五○年六月，悍然发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。杜鲁门政府在朝鲜战争爆发后，又发表了一个破坏远东和平与挑衅的声明，竟派遣其第七舰队公开地侵占了我国的台湾。美帝国主义派遣了军事顾问团驻在西贡，加速运送军火给越南的法国侵略军；同时并加强控制菲律宾。这标志着美国对远东和东南亚的侵略，已由援助各国反动派变为公开的武装干涉。
    在朝鲜战场上遭到决定性失败的美国侵略者，最近竟灭绝人性地使用了细菌武器。美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判中继续进行拖延和破坏，使停战协议一直不能达成，朝鲜的和平一直不能恢复。
    在太平洋东岸的美洲，美国首先把加拿大变为自己的海空军基地，由美军在加拿大北部进行军事的阴谋活动。还在一九四七年，美帝国主义就和拉丁美洲各国反动政府签订了“里约热内卢公约”。这个公约规定它们必须支持美国的侵略战争。最近美国又根据干涉他国内政的所谓“共同安全法”，正分别和拉丁美洲各国的统治者订立所谓“双边军事协定”，以驱使拉丁美洲各国人民作侵略战争的牺牲品。
    美国战争政策的另一面，是疯狂地对各国人民实行经济垄断和掠夺。在美加“战后合作”协定的伪装下，加拿大工业已成为美国军火生产的附属品。美国独占资本控制了拉丁美洲几乎全部的铁砂生产，十分之九以上的铜和一半以上的石油。拉丁美洲供应着美国总输入的三分之一，其中大部都是战略原料。美国独占资本无孔不入地侵入日本和东南亚，榨取巨额利润，攫取马来亚的橡胶和锡砂，菲律宾的锰和铜，印度尼西亚的石油和铁矾土，泰国的森林、缅甸的非铁金属及其他国家的资源。美帝国主义并企图以“封锁”“禁运”来切断这些地区与新中国的自然的经济联系。美国这种经济掠夺和反动措施使亚洲及太平洋区域许多国家的和平经济走向萎缩和破产，使这些国家人民的生活水平日益降低。
    在美国国内，杜鲁门政府正在疯狂地进行扩军备战。一九五零—五一年度美国军事费总额达六百五十亿美元。一九五一—五二年度更增为八百十八亿美元的空前庞大数字。朝鲜战争爆发后的第一年中，美国军事机构和独占资本家签订了四百二十亿美元的军事定货合同。在一九五零—五一和一九五一—五二这两个预算年度中，美国政府预定发出价值八百七十亿美元的军事定货。
    但是，美帝国主义的战争政策，遭到了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的坚强反对。美国侵略者在朝鲜的败北，宣告了它在亚洲及太平洋区域的败北。中朝人民部队给美国侵略者的横行霸道时代敲了丧钟。在作为美国重要军事基地的日本以及东南亚，在作为美国战略原料重要供应地的拉丁美洲，保卫和平、争取自由的强大运动正在蓬勃发展。马林科夫在一九四九年就已指出：“亚洲各国，太平洋沿岸地区以及全部殖民地世界中的民族解放斗争，都升到了新的、更高得多的阶段。”美帝国主义企图奴役亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，并把他们拖入战争的阴谋计划，是注定要失败的。
    最近我国努力和平事业的十一位著名人士，代表我国人民意志，发起召开“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”。这对亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平的人民，是一件具有极大意义和鼓舞人心的事件，因此获得他们的热烈响应和拥护。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民必将更加紧密地团结起来，为保卫和平与安全，为争取民族独立，为改善各国人民的经济生活和促进文化交流而斗争。（崔奇）
