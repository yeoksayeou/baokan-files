The second lecture: Conscientiously doing a good job in ideological mobilization is a prerequisite for the victorious completion of the teaching task

Last time we talked about the characteristics of the quick literacy method. Today, we will begin to introduce the first step of quick teaching—ideological mobilization. This is an important step in quick literacy teaching. Originally, ideological mobilization is necessary for any work, and ideological mobilization for quick literacy teaching is of particular importance. On the one hand, most of the students do not yet understand this new method and feel that learning culture is difficult. On the other hand, the characteristic of this teaching method is that it requires students to concentrate their energy and learn in a fighting and assault posture. Therefore, the experience of many units has proved that without in-depth ideological mobilization, the victorious completion of the teaching task cannot be guaranteed.

How to carry out ideological mobilization?

First, the quick literacy teaching process is not simply a matter of cultural teachers teaching. Like other work, it will encounter many ideological obstacles and specific difficulties from beginning to end, and everyone must be mobilized to overcome them. This requires the leadership's attention, the head's responsibility, the guarantee of the Party and the Youth League, and the cooperation of the administration. Ideological mobilization must be carried out repeatedly among cadres and soldiers, from inside the Party to outside the Party, through various large and small meetings and individual talks, to ensure that it is universally and deeply penetrated into every unit and every individual, to eliminate dead corners, and to break down various obstacles and solve the difficulties of teachers and students in a timely manner. The head must carefully check and personally grasp the mobilization work.

Second, the content of the mobilization work: First of all, it must be explained that the quick literacy method is the key to opening the "door of culture." Only by correctly mastering and using it can our comrades of worker and peasant origin quickly improve their cultural level, master science and technology, and enable our army to accelerate its development into a modern national defense force, to complete the great task of defending the motherland, defending the Far East, and world peace. At the same time, we must criticize some incorrect ideas about cultural learning and raise the importance of cultural learning to a matter of principle.

In terms of method, it is necessary to explain clearly to all students: (1) Why can literacy be achieved quickly? (2) How can it be achieved quickly? To dispel the students' concerns. However, ideological concerns cannot be resolved all at once; our mobilization work must be step by step, one more powerful than the other, until a climax is created. When students first hear about the quick literacy method, everyone has various ideas. For example, some people say: "Even if you rack your brains, you can't cram hundreds of characters into your head in one day!" They feel that they couldn't learn even three or five characters a day in the past, so how can they learn well now? But after deliberation among cadres, among Party members and Youth League members, mobilization at military conferences, discussions in squads and platoons, and individual talks with Party members, Youth League members, and the masses, the students initially understood the principle that literacy can be achieved quickly and no longer doubted it. At this time, it is necessary to pay attention to their other concern: doubting whether they have the possibility of learning two or three hundred characters a day. They hold a "try it" attitude. At this time, it is necessary to introduce the achievements of other units, exhibit homework, and report the learning experience of students to gradually overcome their doubts and concerns. In addition, some people may think: "Others are smart and can learn; I am stupid (or old), I am afraid I can't!" At this time, the head can clearly assign tasks and call on everyone to resolutely complete the learning plan to strengthen their determination to learn; the teachers will guarantee to patiently teach everyone well to strengthen their confidence. In this way, after the masses' thoughts and the leadership's thoughts are aligned and a completely conscious and voluntary mass learning movement is created, the completion of the quick literacy teaching plan is guaranteed.

Third, the initial mobilization should be a combat mobilization. Because one of the characteristics of the quick literacy method is to rely on the students' assault spirit to improve teaching efficiency and achieve the purpose of teaching; therefore, a combat mobilization method must be adopted during mobilization. At the opening ceremony, call on the students to learn with the same energy as in the Huaihai Campaign and encourage the students. And take the spirit of the volunteers overcoming difficulties on the Korean front to inspire everyone, so that when they encounter difficulties in learning, they will think: How bright and happy the prospects of our motherland are, and how glorious is the task of building national defense and consolidating national defense. Our People's Liberation Army has a glorious tradition of not fearing hardships and difficulties. We can seize the enemy's planes and cannons, can we still be stumped by these few new characters? In this way, we can greatly promote everyone's spirit of hard study, hard practice, and not fearing difficulties.

Fourth, ideological mobilization work should be implemented throughout the entire teaching process and should be carried out continuously. Ideological mobilization work does not mean that everything is fine after the "spirit" is drummed up at the beginning. It must be continuously mobilized in the teaching process, combined with the progress of learning. Students are not familiar with the entire teaching process of the quick literacy method, and they will encounter new difficulties at any time. Such as: "Phonetic symbols are not easy to remember," "Pinyin is too difficult, I can't get my tongue around it," "Too many new characters are taught," "I can't read if I leave the phonetic symbols," "It's okay to just teach reading and not writing," "Writing is too difficult, my mind is blank and I have nothing to write," and so on. These concerns should be resolved in a timely manner so that students can always maintain full and vigorous learning enthusiasm.

When Comrade Qi Jianhua was mobilizing, he said to the students at the beginning: "I guarantee that everyone will learn at least forty characters a day! But everyone must have enough confidence! We can catch the running enemies; can't we catch these characters that don't run?" Qi Jianhua then asked the students: "Do you need weapons to fight?" Everyone said: "Yes!" He asked, "Do you need tools for production?" Everyone said: "Yes!" He then asked: "Do you need methods for learning?" Everyone said: "Yes!" So he said loudly: "Okay, the quick literacy method is a good method for us to learn literacy; it is a good 'crutch' for our literacy!" After such a lively mobilization, the soldiers' learning enthusiasm was improved.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第二讲  认真做好思想动员工作是胜利完成教学任务的先决条件
    上次我们谈过了速成识字法的特点，今天我们开始介绍速成教学的第一个步骤——思想动员工作。这是速成识字教学中的一个重要步骤。本来，进行任何工作，都必须要有思想动员，而速成识字教学的思想动员工作，更具有特殊重要的意义。这一方面是由于绝大部分的学员，对这个新的方法还不了解，对学习文化感觉困难；另一方面，这个教学法的特点是：要求学员集中精力，以战斗、突击的姿态来进行学习。因此，许多单位的经验证明，没有深入的思想动员，就不能保证教学任务的胜利完成。
    怎样进行思想动员呢？
    第一，速成识字教学过程，不单纯是文化教员的教课问题。它和其他工作一样，从头到尾都会遇到许多思想障碍和具体困难，必须全体动员起来克服它。这就需要领导方面的重视、首长负责、党和青年团的保证、行政的配合。思想动员工作必须在干部、战士中，从党内到党外，通过各种大小会议及个别谈话等方式，反复地进行，务求普遍深入到每一个单位、每一个人，消灭死角，及时打破各种障碍，解决教员与学员中的困难。首长必须认真检查、亲自掌握动员工作。
    第二，动员工作的内容：首先要说明速成识字法是打开“文化大门”的钥匙，只有正确地掌握和运用它，我们工农出身的同志才能很快地提高文化水平，掌握科学技术，使我们的部队加速地发展为现代化的国防军，完成保卫祖国、保卫远东和世界和平的伟大任务。同时必须批判某些对文化学习的不正确的思想，把学习文化的重要性提到原则的高度。
    在方法上，一定要向全体学员交代清楚：（一）为什么识字可以速成？（二）怎样才能速成？以解除学员的顾虑。但是，思想顾虑不是一下子就能解决的；我们的动员工作必须一步接着一步，一个比一个有力，直到造成高潮。学员开始听到速成识字法时，每个人有着种种不同的想法。譬如，有人说：“敲破脑壳，一天也装不进几百字！”他们觉得以往学文化，每天学三、五个字还学不好，现在就能学好吗？但经过在干部中、在党员和青年团员中的酝酿，军人大会上的动员，班排的讨论，以及对党员和青年团员、群众的个别谈话以后，学员初步懂得了识字可以速成的道理，不再怀疑了。这时，必须注意到他们的另一顾虑：怀疑自己是否有一天学两三百字的可能。他们抱着“试试看”的态度。这时必须通过其他单位的成绩介绍、作业展览和学员的学习经验报告，使他们逐渐地克服自己的怀疑和顾虑。另外，有些人也许会这样想：“别人聪明，能学会；我笨（或年纪大），恐怕不行！”这时，可以由首长明确交代任务，号召大家坚决完成学习计划，以坚定他们的学习决心；教员则保证耐心教好大家，以坚定他们的信心。这样使群众的思想与领导思想达到一致，造成完全自觉自愿的群众性的学习运动后，速成识字教学计划的完成就有了保证。
    第三，开始的动员应该是一个战斗性的动员。因为速成识字法的特点之一，就是要依靠学员的突击精神，来提高教学效率，达到教学的目的；所以在动员时必须采取战斗动员的方式。在开学典礼上，号召学员拿出打淮海战役的劲头来学习，鼓励学员。并且拿志愿军在朝鲜前线克服困难的精神来激发大家，使大家在学习中遇到困难时，就想到：我们祖国的远景多么光明幸福，建设国防、巩固国防的任务又是多么光荣。我们解放军具有着不怕艰苦困难的光荣传统。敌人的飞机大炮我们都能夺过来，难道还能被这几个生字难住？这样就可以大大地发扬大家的苦学苦练、不怕困难的精神。
    第四，思想动员工作应贯彻在整个的教学过程中，要连续进行。思想动员工作，不是一开始把“气”给鼓起来就算万事大吉了，必须在教学过程中，结合学习进展的情况，不断地进行动员。学员对于速成识字法的整个教学过程是不熟悉的，他们随时都会碰到新的困难。如：“注音符号不好记”“拼音太难，绕不过嘴来”“生字教的太多了”“撇开注音符号不会念呀”“光教念不教写还行”“写话太难，脑子空空的没啥可写”等等。这些顾虑，应该及时加以解决，才能使学员始终保持饱满旺盛的学习情绪。
    祁建华同志在动员时一开头就向学员们说：“我保证大家每天最少学会四十个字！不过大家要有足够的信心！会跑的敌人我们都能捉住；这些不会跑的字，我们还不能把它捉住吗？”祁建华又问学员：“打仗要不要武器？”大家说：“要！”问“生产要不要工具？”大家说：“要！”他又问：“学习要不要方法？”大家说：“要！”于是他就大声地说：“好了，速成识字法就是我们学识字的好方法；是我们识字的好‘拐棍’！”经过这样生动活泼地动员之后，战士的学习情绪便提高了。
