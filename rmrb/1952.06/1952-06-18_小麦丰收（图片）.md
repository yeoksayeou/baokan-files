    Wheat Bumper Harvest
    This year, the nation has experienced a widespread bumper harvest of wheat. The picture shows male and female members of the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province harvesting wheat. This year, the average wheat yield of the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative is 300 jin per mu, with high-yield areas reaching around 500 to 600 jin. (The photos in this issue of the pictorial are taken by Zhu Bo of this newspaper.)
    The Shuangqiao Practice Farm of the Central Ministry of Agriculture's Mechanized Farming School is using Soviet-made Stalin-6 combine harvesters for wheat harvesting. Using this type of machinery can harvest 20 to 25 mu of wheat per hour, fully demonstrating the superiority of agricultural mechanization.
    This is the Stalin-4 combine harvester in operation during wheat harvesting. Using this machinery, 16 to 20 mu of wheat can be harvested per hour.
    Members of the Liu Dongdong Mutual Aid Team in Hebei Province are performing "winnowing" work on the threshing ground to remove impurities from the wheat kernels.
    After the wheat harvest is completed, farmers immediately transport large quantities of fertilizer to the fields, preparing to strive for a bumper harvest of the next season's crops. This is a scene of members of the Di Heisan Mutual Aid Team in Hebei Province delivering manure.
    The agricultural workers at the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Experimental Farm are all from farming families and understand that "good seeds produce good seedlings, and a good gourd is split from a good ladle." To strive to increase next year's wheat yield, they are universally carrying out field seed selection work before the wheat harvest begins.
    Members of the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province are loading bundles of wheat onto large carts, preparing to transport them to the threshing ground.
    Members of the Liu Dongdong Mutual Aid Team in Hebei Province are happily loading full wheat kernels into bags.
    Male and female members of the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province are cutting the wheat ears with a chaff cutter.
    Agricultural workers at the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Experimental Farm are using an electric thresher to thresh wheat. Using this type of thresher can complete the wheat threshing work of about 100 mu per day.
    The Liu Zhicheng Mutual Aid Team in Hebei Province lays the harvested wheat on the threshing ground, and after being exposed to the sun, it is then pressed and rolled by animal power.
    Farmers are eating in the wheat fields to speed up the wheat harvest. This is a scene of female members of the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Production Cooperative bringing food to the fields.

    小麦丰收
    今年全国小麦普遍丰收。这是河北省许思曾农业生产合作社的男女社员们在收割小麦时的情形。许思曾农业生产合作社今年小麦的产量平均每亩收三百斤，丰产地可以收五百斤到六百斤左右。（本期画刊照片是由本报朱波拍摄的）
    中央农业部机耕学校双桥实习农场采用苏联制造的斯大林——六号拖拉收割机正在进行小麦收割工作。利用这种机械收割小麦，每小时可以收割小麦二十亩到二十五亩，充分显示了农业机械化的优越性。
    这是斯大林——四号联合收割机正在收割小麦时的情形。利用这种机械，每小时可以收割小麦十六亩到二十亩。
    河北省刘洞洞互助组组员们在打麦场上进行“扬场”工作，清除麦粒中的杂物。
    小麦收割完了后，农民们紧接着就往地里运送大量肥料，准备争取下一季农作物的丰收。这是河北省狄黑三互助组组员送粪时的情形。
    河北省农业试验场的农业工人，都是来自农家，他们懂得：“好种出好苗，好葫芦剖好瓢”。为了争取提高明年的小麦产量，他们在麦收开始前，普遍地进行田间选种工作。
    河北省许思曾农业生产合作社的社员们把一捆捆的小麦装上大车，准备拉到打麦场上去。
    河北省刘洞洞互助组组员们愉快地把丰满的麦粒装进袋里去。
    河北省许思曾农业生产合作社的男女社员们把麦穗用铡刀铡下来。
    河北省农业试验场的农业工人正在利用电力脱粒机进行小麦脱粒工作。利用这种脱粒机每天可以完成一百亩左右的小麦脱粒工作。
    河北省刘志成互助组把割回来的小麦铺在打麦场上，经过太阳曝晒后，冉用畜力压碾。
    农民们为了加紧收割小麦，都是在麦田里吃饭。这是许思曾农业生产合作社的女社员们正向田里送饭时的情形。
