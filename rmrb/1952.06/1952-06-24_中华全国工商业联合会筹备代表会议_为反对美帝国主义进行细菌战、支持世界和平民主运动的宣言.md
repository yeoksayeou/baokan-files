    The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is now being held in Beijing, the capital of our motherland. We are 414 representatives from all over the country (including ethnic minority areas), representing large, medium, and small cities, public and private enterprises, cooperatives, large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen, as well as overseas Chinese. We are discussing the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and other issues. We, the industrialists and businessmen of the whole country, together with the people of China, are striving to develop production, prosper the economy, and build an independent, free, peaceful, and happy New China on the road led by our great Chairman Mao Zedong. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to the peace and security of our country, nor can we ignore the threat of imperialists making war and creating unrest to the peace and security of our country. For this reason, we hereby make the following declaration:
    First, US imperialism is still continuing its war of aggression against Korea, slaughtering the peaceful people of Korea day and night, and a large number of innocent women and children are dying every day. US imperialism is using extremely shameless means to delay and obstruct the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. It openly violates the 1949 Geneva Convention regarding the humane treatment of prisoners of war and the immediate and complete repatriation of prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, illegally carrying out "screening" of captured personnel from China and Korea with the terror of death, and carrying out large-scale massacres. US imperialism is even more inhumanly conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. US imperialism had long been preparing for this ugly crime. After World War II, the US government immediately recruited Japanese germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii, Nazi germ warfare criminal Schreiber, and others to open germ factories and manufacture germ weapons. In order to deliberately prepare and use germ weapons, US imperialism even refused to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and Bacteriological Methods of Warfare. Now US imperialism is using inhumane germ weapons to slaughter human beings, which violates the Hague Convention of 1899 and 1907 regarding the laws and customs of war on land prohibiting the use of poisons and poisonous weapons, violates the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and violates the "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" passed by the Third General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. We have seen with our own eyes at the exhibition in Beijing the germ bombs dropped by US imperialism in Korea and Northeast China; we have seen flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, fleas, crickets, snakes, rats, feathers, etc. spread by germ bombs, as well as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, plague, anthrax, and other germs separated from these insects and objects; we have also seen with our own eyes the handwritten confessions of US imperialist germ warfare prisoners Quinn and Enoch, and we have also heard with our own ears the recorded confessions of Quinn and Enoch. These are undeniable ironclad evidence. We absolutely cannot tolerate US imperialism using germ weapons to slaughter human beings. We firmly oppose the US government's germ warfare. We call on all peace-loving people around the world to unite and stop the heinous germ warfare. We insist on achieving an armistice in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis, peacefully resolving the Korean issue, and realizing the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world.
    Second, US imperialism arbitrarily declared the San Francisco separate peace treaty with Japan to be effective on April 28 this year, and at the same time announced the so-called US-Japan Security Treaty to be effective, in order to continue to occupy Japan, actively arm Japan, and turn Japan into a military bridgehead for the United States in the Far East, and instructed the Japanese Yoshida government to sign a so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, completely obliterating the sacred right of the 500 million Chinese people in the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. US imperialism is also attempting to form a Pacific aggressive bloc with Japan as the center. We firmly oppose the US-made separate peace treaty with Japan, and firmly oppose the so-called peace treaty between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. These two so-called "peace treaties" are fundamentally illegal and therefore fundamentally invalid. We firmly oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and oppose turning Japan into a base for US imperialism's aggression against the Asian people, threatening the peace and security of Asia and the Pacific region. Therefore, we respond to the declaration of the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, and strive to unite peaceful people and realize peace in the Asian and Pacific region!
    Third, US imperialism is playing with fire in front of the people of the world. It is not only delaying the Korean War and rearming Japan, but also expanding its armaments and preparing for war in many ways to enrich the Wall Street monopoly capital group, seriously threatening world peace. US imperialism is also stepping up the arming of West Germany, expanding the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and is mass-producing atomic weapons, and is blockading and imposing embargoes on peaceful and democratic countries, especially on New China. All this is seriously endangering world security and peace. We firmly believe that countries with different political systems can coexist peacefully, and any international problem can be solved peacefully. Therefore, we firmly oppose the expansion of armaments and preparation for war. We demand universal disarmament in the world, and absolutely prohibit the use of atomic weapons, germ weapons, and chemical weapons; we firmly oppose embargoes and blockades; we demand the development of international economic relations and the conduct of equal and mutually beneficial trade exchanges that respect sovereignty; we demand extensive cultural exchanges to develop peaceful factors between countries; we demand the convening of a five-power conference and the conclusion of a five-power peace treaty. We, the industrialists and businessmen of New China, together with the people of China, resolutely support the world peace and democracy movement and strive to defend world peace and security!

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议
    为反对美帝国主义进行细菌战、支持世界和平民主运动的宣言
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，现在正在我们祖国的首都北京开会。我们来自全国各地（包括少数民族地区），代表了全国大、中、小城市，公私营企业、合作社和大、中、小工商业者，以及国外侨胞的四百一十四位代表，正在讨论成立中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会等问题。我们全国的工商业者正和全中国人民一道，在我们伟大的毛泽东主席所领导的道路上，努力发展生产，繁荣经济，为建设一个独立、自由、和平、幸福的新中国而奋斗。因此，我们不能不注意到我们国家的和平与安全，也不能不注意到帝国主义者制造战争，制造不安，对于我们国家的和平与安全的威胁。为此，我们特作以下的宣言：
    第一、美帝国主义还在继续进行着侵略朝鲜的战争，日日夜夜地屠杀朝鲜的和平人民，每天有大量的无辜的妇女与儿童在死亡着。美帝国主义正在用极无耻的方式拖延和阻挠着板门店停战谈判。它公然破坏一九四九年关于对战俘人道待遇及战争停止后立即全部遣返战俘的日内瓦公约，对中朝被俘人员以死亡的恐怖非法进行“甄别”，大举屠杀。美帝国主义更灭绝人性地在朝鲜及中国东北各地进行细菌战争。美帝国主义老早就在准备着这种丑恶罪行。第二次世界大战后，美国政府立即网罗日本细菌战犯石井四郎，纳粹细菌战犯施莱勃等开办细菌工厂，制造细菌武器。美帝国主义为了蓄意准备并使用细菌武器，甚至拒绝批准一九二五年关于禁用窒息性有毒的或其他瓦斯以及细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。现在美帝国主义正以惨无人道的细菌武器来屠杀人类，这是违反一八九九年暨一九○七年关于禁用毒物及有毒武器的陆战法规与惯例的海牙公约，违反一九二五年日内瓦议定书，并违反一九四八年联合国第三次大会通过的“防止并惩办灭种性的屠杀罪公约”的。我们在北京的展览会亲眼看到美帝国主义在朝鲜及我东北地区投下的细菌弹；看到用细菌弹散布的苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、跳蚤、蟋蟀、蛇、鼠、羽毛等等以及由这些昆虫、物体分离出来的伤寒、霍乱、痢疾、鼠疫、炭疽等病菌；我们还亲眼看到美帝国主义细菌战俘虏奎恩与伊纳克二人的亲笔供词，我们也亲耳听到奎恩与伊纳克的供词录音。这都是无可狡赖的铁证。我们绝对不能容忍美帝国主义以细菌武器屠杀人类，我们坚决反对美国政府进行细菌战，我们呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民一致起来，制止万恶的细菌战。我们坚持在公平合理的基础上，实现朝鲜的停战，和平解决朝鲜问题，实现全世界人民的和平愿望。
    第二、美帝国主义专横地宣布旧金山单独对日和约于今年四月二十八日生效，同时并宣布所谓美日安全条约生效，以便继续占领日本，积极武装日本，变日本为美国远东军事的桥头堡，并指示日本吉田政府与台湾蒋介石匪帮签订所谓“中日和约”，完全抹杀五万万中国人民八年对日抗战的神圣权利。美帝国主义又企图以日本为中心而组成一个太平洋侵略集团。我们坚决反对美制对日单独和约，坚决反对日本与蒋匪帮间的所谓和约。这两个所谓“和约”是根本非法的，因而是根本无效的。我们坚决反对复活日本军国主义，反对把日本变成美帝国主义对亚洲人民的侵略基地，以威胁亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全，因此，我们响应亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的宣言，为团结和平人民，为实现亚洲及太平洋区域的和平而努力！
    第三、美帝国主义正在世界人民面前玩火，它不仅拖延着朝鲜战争，重新武装日本，还在多方面地进行扩军备战，以养肥华尔街垄断资本集团，严重威胁着世界和平。美帝国主义也在加紧武装西德，扩大北大西洋侵略集团，并在大量制造原子武器，对和平民主国家特别是对新中国进行封锁与禁运，这一切都是严重地危害着世界的安全与和平。我们深信各种不同的政治制度的国家之间，是可以和平共存的，国际间的任何问题都是可以用和平方式来解决的。因此，我们坚决反对扩军备战，我们要求世界普遍裁军，绝对禁止使用原子武器、细菌武器及化学武器；我们坚决反对禁运与封锁；我们要求发展国际经济关系，进行平等互利、互相尊重主权的贸易来往；我们要求广泛进行文化交流，以发展国际间的和平因素；我们要求召开五大国会议，缔结五大国和平公约。我们新中国工商业者，与全中国人民一道，坚决支持世界和平民主运动，为保卫世界的和平与安全而奋斗！

    一九五二年六月二十三日
