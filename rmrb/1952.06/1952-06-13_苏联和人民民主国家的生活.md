    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw—A Precious Gift from the Soviet Union to Poland
    According to the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Poland on April 5th of this year, the Soviet Union will build a Palace of Culture and Science for the Polish people on the central square of Warsaw. This Palace of Culture and Science will be the most magnificent building in Warsaw. Its height will be 220 meters, its volume approximately 800,000 cubic meters, and the total area of the internal room floors will be over 66,000 square meters, capable of accommodating 12,000 people simultaneously.

    The construction of the Palace of Culture and Science is the first step in building the new center of Warsaw, which will extend from the Gdansk Railway Station to Rakowiecka Street.

    The Palace of Culture and Science will not be the only large building in Warsaw. In other locations in Warsaw, new buildings will be erected to complement the Palace of Culture and Science, and the silhouette of the new Warsaw will rise against the backdrop of the old Warsaw.

    The designers of the Palace of Culture and Science held a meeting in Moscow in 1951, where Soviet and Polish designers and urban planners discussed the location of this tallest building in Poland. Soviet architects and designers visited many places in Poland, which have monuments of Polish national architecture.

    In February of this year, Polish architects and designers went to Moscow to discuss four architectural plans drafted by Soviet designers with their Soviet counterparts. The discussion resulted in a fifth plan. This final plan has been approved by the government of the Polish Republic.

    The Palace of Culture and Science will be surrounded by trees, and beyond that, gardens. The gardens will feature beautiful sculptures and fountains. The Palace of Culture and Science consists of five basic parts, the uppermost of which will house the Polish Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Scientific Cadres, and the Society for the Popularization of Knowledge.

    The lower four floors of the building will be the Academy of Sciences' portico and conference hall. In addition, the agencies under the Academy of Sciences will occupy approximately 250 rooms and studios, as well as six two-story classrooms. The Society for the Popularization of Knowledge will occupy 50 studios, a large theater with 400 seats, and two smaller theaters with 200 seats each. The Academy of Scientific Cadres will occupy 120 rooms and 52 studios for scientific workers, a large library and reading room, 12 lecture halls, and an auditorium that can accommodate 400 people.

    The largest space in the Palace of Culture and Science will be occupied by the Palace of Youth. The Palace of Youth will be divided into a study department, an arts and crafts department, a laboratory, and a technical department, as well as all necessary sports facilities, such as a 10-meter deep swimming pool for diving, a gymnasium, and shooting range equipment.

    The ground floor of the building will be a museum and exhibition hall, including a permanent industrial and technical exhibition hall.

    The special conference hall in the Palace of Culture and Science can accommodate 3,700 people. The total area of the various halls is 8,850 square meters, including a theater with 800 seats, a concert hall with 600 seats, a lecture hall with 580 seats, and two cinemas each with 480 seats.

    Currently, clearing work is underway on the ground where the Palace of Culture and Science will be built. The main cornerstone of the Palace of Culture and Science will be laid in the second half of this year. On the construction site, one can see many of the finest and most modern Soviet excavators, tractors, and pneumatic drills, clearing garbage and rubble from the destroyed houses.

    New machines, equipment, and construction materials are arriving from the Soviet Union every day. The equipment and materials shipped to Warsaw have reached 1,239 train cars.

    2,500 workers are already participating in the preparatory work for the construction of the Palace of Culture and Science. By 1953, the number of workers engaged in the construction of this grand building will increase to 10,000, including 4,000 Soviet workers, technicians, and engineers. The builders of the tallest buildings in Moscow, who employ the latest working methods and advanced Soviet technology, will teach their working skills to Polish workers, technicians, and engineers.

    The expenses for the Palace of Culture and Science and its affiliated buildings are fully borne by the Soviet Union. All construction materials, machines, and equipment are supplied by the Soviet Union.

    The construction of the Palace of Culture and Science vividly demonstrates the Soviet Union's fraternal and selfless assistance to Poland and the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    华沙文化科学宫—苏联给波兰的珍贵礼物
    根据今年四月五日苏联和波兰所签订的协定，苏联将为波兰人民在华沙的中央广场上建筑一座文化科学宫。这个文化科学宫将是华沙最壮丽的建筑物。它的高度为二百二十公尺，体积约为八十万立方公尺，内部房间地板的总面积为六万六千平方公尺以上，可以同时容纳一万二千人。
    文化科学宫的建筑是建设华沙新中心的第一步，这个新中心从革但斯克车站一直伸展到拉科维茨基大街。
    文化科学宫将不是华沙唯一的大建筑物。在华沙的其他地点，也要建起新的大厦与文化科学宫交相辉映，在旧华沙的背景上将升起新华沙的轮廓。
    文化科学宫的设计者一九五一年在莫斯科召开了一次会议，会上苏联和波兰的设计师和城市建筑学家们讨论了这个波兰最高建筑物的座落地点。苏联的建筑师和设计师参观了波兰的许多地方，这些地方有着波兰民族建筑的古迹。
    今年二月，波兰建筑师和设计师前往莫斯科，和苏联设计师一起讨论了苏联设计师所草拟的四个建筑方案。讨论的结果产生了第五个方案。这个最后方案已被波兰共和国政府批准。
    文化科学宫的四周将栽植树木，再外边是花园。花园里有优美的雕塑和喷泉。文化科学宫由五个基本部分构成，最上边的一部分将是波兰科学院、科学干部学院和知识普及协会。
    这个大厦下部的四层是科学院的门廊和会议厅。此外，科学院所辖机关将占有约二百五十个房间和工作室，以及六个两层的大教室。知识普及协会将占有五十个工作室，一个有四百座位的大剧院和两个各有二百座位的小剧院。科学干部学院将占有一百二十个房间和供给科学工作者用的五十二个工作室，一个大图书馆和阅览室，十二个讲堂和一个可容四百人的礼堂。
    在文化科学宫中占地方最大的是青年宫。青年宫内将分为学习部、技艺部、实验室、技术部，还有一切必要的体育设备，例如可供跳水的十公尺深的游泳池、健身房和打靶设备等。
    大厦的底层将是博物馆和陈列室，其中有固定的工业与技术展览馆。
    文化科学宫中的特别会议厅可容纳三千七百人。各个大厅的总面积为八千八百五十平方公尺，包括可容八百人的剧场，可容六百人的音乐厅，可容五百八十人的讲演厅和两个各容四百八十人的电影院。
    现在，在建筑文化科学宫的地面上正进行着清除工作。文化科学宫的主要基石将在今年下半年奠定。在建筑的现场上，人们可以看到许多最漂亮最新式的苏联掘土机、曳引机和气钻，正从毁坏了的房屋中清除垃圾和瓦砾。
    每天都从苏联运来新的机器、装备和建筑器材。运到华沙的器材和装备已达一千二百三十九车厢。
    参加建筑文化科学宫的准备工作的工人已有两千五百人。到一九五三年，从事建筑这个宏大建筑物的工人将增为一万人，其中有四千人是苏联工人、技师和工程师。采用最新的工作法和先进的苏维埃技术的莫斯科最高建筑物的建筑者，将把他们的工作艺术教给波兰的工人、技师和工程师。
    文化科学宫及其附属建筑的经费全由苏联负担。建筑器材、机器和装备全由苏联供应。
    文化科学宫的建筑，十分生动地表现了苏联对于波兰的兄弟般的无私援助和苏波人民间的牢不可破的友谊。
