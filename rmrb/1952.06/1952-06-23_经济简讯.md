	▲ The patriotic production increase campaign of all ethnic groups in Suiyuan Province has been extensively and deeply developed. Nearly a thousand Mongolian, Han, and Hui mutual aid teams have joined the chain competition. The basic experience of Suiyuan Province in universally and deeply carrying out the patriotic production increase competition campaign is: they organized a production work team of more than two thousand cadres to regularly help with work in rural areas. Yang Zhillin, the vice chairman of the provincial government, Kui Bi, and other responsible cadres also continuously went deep into farmers' households to personally help farmers solve difficulties and come up with ways to complete the plan, which gradually promoted the movement.
	▲ After more than twenty days of intense and organized struggle, the people of Huanghua County, Hebei, have completely eliminated nearly 60,000 mu of locust nymphs. After the locust nymphs were wiped out, in order to do a good job in long-term prevention and control work, the county organized a 419-person inspection team carrying medicine and equipment to patrol the low-lying areas every day. Once locust nymphs are found, they are immediately eliminated.
