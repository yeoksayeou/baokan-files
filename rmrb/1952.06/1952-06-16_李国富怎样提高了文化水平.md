Comrade Li Guofu is the squad leader of the Eighth Squad of the First Company of a certain regiment in the Central and Southern Military Region. Last year, during military training, he was a well-known training model. This time in cultural studies, his achievements are particularly good. Before the implementation of accelerated literacy teaching, he only knew a few hundred characters. Now he has learned more than two thousand characters, can write articles of more than a thousand characters, written with a beginning and an end, with specific and vivid content, a clear central idea, distinct paragraphs, and less than one percent of typos. He can fully understand popular books and newspapers and relatively simple articles in general publications, and can also see the writing advantages of each article, learning from these advantages to improve his writing skills.

Li Guofu's great success in learning culture is primarily because he recognized the significance of learning culture. He said, "Without culture, you can't learn skills, and without skills, you can't eliminate the enemy." His attitude towards learning is good, and his learning methods are also good. He uses his brain, thinks of ways, and finds "tricks"; he studies diligently and practices intensely; he grasps the key points of learning, and concentrates on studying the key points in listening to lectures, doing homework, and reading.

Li Guofu's improvement in writing ability went through the following four stages:

First stage: Reading aloud, copying, developing "four skills," writing sentences.

At the end of accelerated literacy teaching, Li Guofu was about the same level as a current junior high school student. He couldn't read fluently, adding or omitting words, unable to catch his breath, and unable to understand the central idea. At this time, the focus of his study was on reading aloud. He chose easy-to-understand articles to read, looking at each character and each word clearly, and reading aloud like he was speaking. When he was familiar with reading aloud, he understood the main idea and emotions of the text. By reading a lot in this way, he gained a preliminary understanding of grammar.

When he started writing, he wrote very slowly. He thought, "If I want to write fast, I must practice more." So he spent four days copying and writing intensely. He knew that copying could consolidate new characters, so he first copied unfamiliar characters, and then copied them by type. For example, when writing the characters "烧" (shāo - burn), "浇" (jiāo - pour), "绕" (rào - wind), and "晓" (xiǎo - dawn), he thought about the pronunciation and meaning of these characters while copying, analyzing which places were the same and which were different. After four days of copying like this, combined with reading, the more than two thousand characters he knew gradually developed from "two skills" to "three skills," and from "three skills" to "four skills."

Once he was familiar with writing characters, his dictation improved quickly. In just a few days, he increased from dictating seven characters per minute to fourteen characters per minute, and reduced typos from ten percent to two percent. In this way, he had the conditions to start writing sentences.

When he started writing sentences, he followed what the teacher said and wrote in his own words, finding things to write about from his daily life, writing about what he heard, saw, and thought. As the scope of writing expanded and his thoughts unfolded, his enthusiasm for writing sentences became even higher. Later, whenever he encountered a new character or word, he would ask to understand it and then use it to write a sentence. In this way, he developed from writing sentences to making sentences. After writing, he would read it to himself, revise it, and also read it to others, asking for their opinions. In this way, in a few days, he progressed from writing one sentence in ten minutes to writing one sentence in five minutes, and the number of sentences with problems also decreased from four out of ten to one out of ten.

In this way, in half a month, he opened up his thinking and expanded the scope of his writing, laying the foundation for the next stage of writing.

Second stage: Writing a paragraph, learning new words, using conjunctions, reducing typos, correcting repetition and verbosity.

How to connect sentences when developing from writing one sentence to writing a paragraph; how a character can combine with other characters to become many words, and how to master and use them; how to correct typos; what to do with repetitive and verbose sentences... Li Guofu decided to "concentrate firepower and defeat them one by one."

His key was: "Before class, find the difficult points in the text and the difficult points in your own writing, and pay attention to listening during class." When previewing, he marked the places in the text that he didn't quite understand, and paid special attention to these places during class. He marked many "○" and "×" in his book. He marked good sentences and important conjunctions that he wanted to learn to use with "○." He marked things that the teacher didn't explain thoroughly with "×," and asked about them after class. He said, "Every time I listen to a lesson, I must have a focus; if I divide my energy equally, it will be impossible to understand thoroughly."

He paid attention to listening in class and practiced intensely after class. After understanding new words and conjunctions in class, he used them to write a lot of sentences after class. At the same time, during this stage, when he did extracurricular reading, the focus was also on learning new words and using conjunctions.

He prepared a small notebook and wrote down all the words he had used incorrectly or misspelled in each assignment, and reviewed them frequently. Once he misused the two characters "已" (yǐ - already) and "以" (yǐ - with), so he made many sentences with these two characters. His determination was: "If I make a mistake once, I won't allow myself to make it a second time!" In this way, his typos slowly decreased.

In order to correct the problem of repetition and verbosity, he always read his assignments several times after writing them, deleting the repetitive parts; he also read them to others to see which sentences could be removed. In this way, he gradually overcame the problem of repetition and verbosity.

In this stage, he spent more than half a month and achieved the ability to write a paragraph of four hundred characters, explaining a matter.

Third stage: Imitating model essays, learning writing methods.

This stage is very important. From model essays, he learned many good sentences, learned how to select materials, learned how to illustrate a problem through an event, and also exercised his thinking ability.

After each lesson, Li Guofu would think: "What problem does this lesson explain? What 'methods' did the author use to write it?" After thinking it through, he would choose a topic similar to the model essay and write an article. For example, after the teacher taught the fifth volume of "Four Stinky Meats," he wrote a story about landlords oppressing peasants; after reading "White Tiger Company" in "Soldier's Life," he wrote "Battle of Tashan."

If you want to write well, you have to practice more, so he wrote at least one article every day and three articles on Sundays. But writing a lot is not random writing; he wrote about things he was familiar with.

"Think carefully before writing; revise a lot after writing." This is the "trick" that Li Guofu discovered. At first, when he wrote, he modified as he wrote, pondering over a word for a long time and forgetting what was below. Later, he felt that this way of writing was "not getting to the point," so he first thought about the detailed content of the article, drafted an outline, and then wrote it down in one go, without thinking about the words and sentences. After writing, he first corrected typos, then corrected awkward and unclear sentences, then revised the content, then checked whether the central issue was explained clearly, and then deleted unimportant parts. He revised a total of five times before considering it done. After the teacher revised it, he carefully studied and understood it. In this way, he progressed quickly.

Fourth stage: Independent writing, grasping the center, learning the organization structure of articles.

At this stage, he "dropped his crutches" -- broke away from model essays and wrote independently. Before writing, he first considered carefully: what to write, how to write, how to select typical examples, how to organize materials, how to divide paragraphs, how to connect them. After thinking it all through, he drafted a detailed outline. When writing about an event, he divided the paragraphs according to the development of the event; when writing about a problem, he divided it into several aspects.

The focus of listening to lectures and reading in this stage was also on the organizational structure of the article, how to start and end, how to divide paragraphs, and the writing characteristics of the article.

He has not yet fully reached the requirements of the fourth stage, and he is continuing to work hard and move forward.

    李国富怎样提高了文化水平
    孙以翱
    李国富同志是中南军区某团一连第八班班长。去年练兵当中，他是有名的练兵模范。这次文化学习，他的成绩又特别好。在实施速成识字教学以前，他只识几百字，现在已学会了两千多字，能写一千多字的文章，写得有头有尾，内容具体生动，中心明确，段落分明，错别字还不到百分之一；能完全看懂通俗书报和一般报刊上比较浅的文章，还能看出每篇文章写作上的优点，学习这种优点，以提高自己的写作能力。
    李国富学文化得到这样大的成绩，首先是因为他认清了学习文化的意义。他说：“没有文化就学不到本领，没有本领就消灭不了敌人。”他的学习态度好，学习方法也好。动脑筋，想办法，找“窍门”；钻得勤，练得猛；掌握住学习的重点，听课、作业、阅读，都抓紧重点来钻研。
    李国富写作能力的提高，是经过了下述四个阶段：
    第一阶段：朗读，抄写，发展“四会”，写话。
    速成识字教学结束的时候，李国富和现在初二级的学员差不多，阅读不成句，添字漏字，接不上气，也看不出中心大意来。这时，他学习的重点就放在朗读上。他选择容易懂的文章来读，一个字、一个词，看得清清楚楚，大声地念，念得像说话一样。朗读熟了，就领会了课文大意、文章感情。这样读得多了，对语法也就有了初步的概念。
    他开始写字的时候，写得很慢。他想：“要想写得快，一定要多练。”于是就用了四天时间，猛抄猛写。他知道抄写可以巩固生字，就先抄不熟的字，然后分别类型来抄。比如写“烧”“浇”“绕”“晓”这些字，一面抄，一面想这些字的字音、字义，分析它们哪些地方相同，哪些地方不同。经过这样四天的抄写，同时结合阅读，他所认识的两千多字就逐渐从“两会”到“三会”，从“三会”向“四会”发展了。
    字写熟了，听写也就进步得很快。不过几天的时间，他就从每分钟听写七个字增加到十四个字，错别字从百分之十减少到百分之二。这样，进行写话也就有了条件了。
    开始写话，他就照教员讲的，写自己的话，从日常生活里找话写，听到的、见到的、想到的，都写。写的范围扩大了，思想展开了，写话的劲头也就更加高涨。后来，他每见到一个生字生词，问懂了，便用它写一句话。这样，就从写话发展到造句了。写完了，自己念一念，改一改，还念给别人听，请别人提意见。这样，几天的时间，他就从十分钟写一句话进步到五分钟写一句，有毛病的句子也从十分之四减少到十分之一了。
    这样，在半个月里，就打开了思路，扩大了写话的范围，给下一阶段的写作打下了基础。
    第二阶段：写一段话，学习新词，使用连接词，减少错别字，纠正重复啰嗦。
    从写一句话发展到写一段话，句和句怎样衔接；一个字和其他的字结合，可以变成很多的词，怎样掌握它们，使用它们；怎样纠正错别字；句子重复啰嗦怎么办……这些个难点，李国富决定“集中火力，各个击破”。
    他的要领是：“在课前，找出课文上的难点，和自己写作上的难点，上课时注意听。”在预习的时候，他把课文中不十分懂的地方，作上记号，上课时就特别用心听这些地方，他书上划了许多“○”和“×”。凡是教员讲的好句子，重要的连接词，自己要学习使用的，就划上“○”。教员没讲透的，就划上“×”，下课再问。他说：“每听一课书，自己必须有个重点；要是平分精力，就不可能领会透彻。”
    他上课注意听，下课练得猛；上课弄懂了新词和连接词，下课便用它们大量写话。同时，在这个阶段中，他进行课外阅读的时候，重点也是学习新词，使用连接词。
    他预备了一个小本，把自己每次作业中用错写错的字都记上，经常复习。有一次他把“已”“以”两个字用错了，他就用这两个字造了很多句子。他的决心是：“错了一次，就不许错第二次！”这样，他的错别字慢慢就减少了。
    为了纠正重复啰嗦的毛病，他每次把作业写好后，总要看好几遍，把重复的地方删去；还念给别人听，看哪句可以不要。这样，逐渐就克服了重复啰嗦的毛病。
    这一阶段，他用了半个多月的时间，就达到能写四百字的一段话，说明一件事情了。
    第三阶段：模仿范文，学习写作方法。
    这一阶段很重要。他从范文中，学习了很多好的语句，学会了怎样选择材料，学会了怎样通过一件事情说明一个问题，而且还锻炼了思考能力。
    每上完一课，李国富就想：“这课是说明一个什么问题？作者是用什么‘道道’来写的？”想透彻以后，自己就选择一个和范文相像的题目，来写一篇文章。比如教员讲了第五册的“四臭肉”，他就写一篇地主压迫农民的故事；看了“战士生活”上的“白老虎连”，就写了一篇“塔山战斗”。
    要想写得好，就要多练，所以，他每天至少写一篇文章，星期日写三篇。但多写并不是乱写，他写的都是自己熟悉的事物。
    “写以前；要想好；写以后，要多改。”这是李国富摸出来的“窍门”。最初他写作时，边写边修改，为一个词捉摸好半天，把下面的也忘了。以后他觉得这样写“不得要领”，就先把文章的详细内容都想好了，拟出提纲，然后一口气写下去，写的时候不琢磨字句。写完了，先改错别字，再改不通顺、不简明的句子，再修改内容，再看中心问题说清楚了没有，再删去不关紧要的部分。一共改五次，才算作好了。教员修改以后，他再仔细揣摩、体会。这样进步就很快。
    第四阶段：独立写作，抓住中心，学习文章的组织结构。
    到这一阶段，他就“丢拐棍”——脱离范文，独立写作。写以前，先考虑成熟：写什么、怎样写、怎样选择典型、怎样组织材料、怎样分段、怎样衔接。都想好了，就拟一个详细的提纲。写一件事，就根据事情的发展，划分段落；写一个问题，就分成几方面来写。
    这一阶段的听课和阅读，重点也是放在文章的组织结构、怎样开头结尾、怎样分段，以及文章的写作特点上。
    现在第四阶段还没有完全达到要求，他正在继续努力，大步前进。
