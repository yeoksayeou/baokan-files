The central theme of the May production competition at the Shijingshan Power Plant was to reduce fuel costs. The plant planned to burn 7,335 tons of low-quality coal (coal washing stone from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant) in May to reduce fuel costs by 5%. By May 30, the plant had actually burned 8,812 tons of low-quality coal, exceeding the original plan by 20%, reducing fuel costs by 9.09%, exceeding the state's assigned task.

Burning low-quality coal is one of the important advanced experiences in the power industry system to increase production, practice economy, and reduce costs. The plant began to test burning low-quality coal last year. In March of this year, the plant appropriately mixed coal washing stone, hard coal, and bituminous coal, which can reduce fuel costs by more than 20%. After opposing waste and carefully calculating accounts, the masses clearly established a concept of cost. The plant leadership seized this central link and put forward the slogan of burning low-quality coal and reducing costs.

The vast number of employees accepted the task of burning low-quality coal and immediately revised the patriotic convention around the May collective contract and signed workshop competition contracts and three-shift competition contracts. Coal pulverizer and other groups took the initiative to request burning low-quality coal. However, some cadres, workers, and technicians did not sufficiently understand the important significance of burning low-quality coal, so the competition encountered ideological obstacles.

The first problem encountered was whether it could be burned or not. Some technicians emphasized that "the plant's boiler was designed to burn good coal," and "burning low-quality coal will affect the boiler's output." Some workers also said: "We are afraid that we won't be able to maintain steam pressure." However, most workers believed that burning one-ten-thousandth of low-quality coal was possible. The plant leadership studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in burning low-quality coal, summarized the achievements of trial burning, and affirmed that the view of opposing safety and economy was incorrect. The Party committee made a resolution, calling on Party members to take the lead in overcoming difficulties, and organized technical personnel to go deep into the front lines and combine with workers to resolutely burn low-quality coal well.

Burning low-quality coal did encounter many difficulties: the steam temperature decreased, more coal clinkers formed, and the output of the coal mill was low. Therefore, some people became afraid again and said: "Don't overdo it." They advocated changing the ratio of good coal to bad coal in the pulverized coal furnace from two to one to five to one. All the workers actively used their brains and worked with the technical personnel to find solutions, and finally overcame a series of technical obstacles. In order to solve the problem of decreasing steam temperature, the workers accepted the Soviet expert's suggestion and implemented the "dust blowing" method, and found out the rules of dust blowing, increasing the steam temperature from 390 degrees to 425 degrees, which can save more than 500 tons of coal per month. In order to solve the problem of clinker formation, the workers proposed the method of "burning from above and hitting from below" (burning with the flame inside the boiler while hitting with the furnace bars) to ensure that the furnace would never be shut down due to clinker formation within five months, reducing losses by 5.88 million yuan per month.

### 石景山发电厂燃烧劣质煤成功

    石景山发电厂燃烧劣质煤成功
    石景山发电厂五月份生产竞赛的中心内容是降低燃料成本。该厂准备在五月份烧劣质煤（石景山钢铁厂的洗煤石）七千三百三十五吨，以便降低燃料成本百分之五。到五月三十日为止，该厂实烧劣质煤八千八百一十二吨，超过原订计划百分之二十，降低燃料成本百分之九点零九，超过了国家给予的任务。
    烧劣质煤是电业系统中增产节约、降低成本的重要先进经验之一。该厂去年就开始试烧劣质煤。今年三月，该厂将洗煤石、硬煤、烟煤适当混烧，可降低燃料成本百分之二十以上。经过反浪费，算细账，群众明确地树立了成本观念，该厂领导方面就抓住这一中心环节，提出烧劣质煤，降低成本的口号。
    广大职工接受了烧劣质煤的任务，立即围绕着五月份的集体合同，修订了爱国公约，签订了车间竞赛合同和三值竞赛合同。煤粉炉等小组，主动地要求烧劣质煤。但也有一部分干部、工人和技术人员，对烧劣质煤的重要意义认识不足，因此竞赛遇到了思想障碍。
    首先遇到的是能烧不能烧的问题。有些技术员强调“本厂锅炉就是为烧好煤设计的”，“改烧劣质煤会影响锅炉出力”。有的工人也说：“怕顶不上汽。”但大部分工人认为：烧万分之一的劣质煤是可以的。该厂领导方面研究了苏联烧劣质煤的先进经验，总结了试烧的成绩，肯定了把安全与节约对立起来的看法是不对的。党委做出了决议，号召党员带头克服困难，并组织技术人员深入现场，和工人结合，坚决烧好劣质煤。
    烧劣质煤确实遇到了不少的困难：蒸汽温度降低了，煤熘子结多了，磨煤机产量低了，因此，有人又害怕起来，说：“可别过火了。”他们主张把煤粉炉好坏煤的比例，从二比一改为五比一。全体工人积极开动脑筋，和技术人员一道想办法，终于克服了一系列的技术障碍。为了解决汽温降低问题，工人接受苏联专家建议，实行了“吹尘”的办法，并且摸出了吹尘的规律，使汽温从三百九十度提高到四百二十五度，全月约可省煤五百吨以上。为了解决结榴子问题，工人们提出了“上烧下打”（用锅炉内的火焰烧，同时用炉条打）的办法，保证五个月内绝不因结榴子而停炉，每月减少损失五百八十八万元。
