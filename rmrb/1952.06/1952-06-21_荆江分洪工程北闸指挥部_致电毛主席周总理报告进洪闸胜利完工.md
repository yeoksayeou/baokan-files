    Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project North Sluice Headquarters
    Sends a telegram to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou reporting the successful completion of the flood diversion sluice
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, 20th] The Taipingkou Flood Diversion Sluice (i.e., the North Sluice) of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project was completed on June 18th. Gate opening and closing tests have been carried out, and the results are good. The North Sluice Headquarters of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou reporting the successful completion of this massive project. The telegram is as follows:
    The Taipingkou Flood Diversion Sluice in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area commenced construction on April 5th and was completely and successfully completed on June 18th. The construction of the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Sluice took more than seventy days, with less than forty days of actual construction time excluding rainy days. In this very short period, we completed this massive project, which included millions of cubic meters of earthwork and 85,000 cubic meters of concrete work. Now, this 1,054-meter-long, 54-hole modern giant sluice gate stands like a Great Wall at the entrance of the flood diversion area on the south bank of the Jingjiang River.
    Thanks to your correct leadership, and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and thanks to the eight thousand workers, peasants, and soldiers who displayed a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm, and the strong support of party and government organizations at all levels, we have achieved this great victory. People are amazed that this is a miracle. It is unimaginable and unbelievable that such a large project could be completed in such a short period of time in capitalist countries, colonial countries, and old China. Today, the emergence of this miracle in New China once again proves the superiority of the new democratic social system and the infinite power of the hardworking, brave, and intelligent working people. Therefore, this glory should first belong to you and the people of the whole country. We will never be arrogant and complacent because of this great victory. We will thoroughly summarize the experiences and lessons learned during the construction process as weapons for us to strive for even greater victories in the construction projects of the motherland. Thank you for your instructions and concern.

    荆江分洪工程北闸指挥部
    致电毛主席周总理报告进洪闸胜利完工
    【新华社沙市二十日电】荆江分洪工程中的太平口进洪闸（即北闸）已于六月十八日落成。已举行闸门启闭试验，结果良好。荆江分洪工程北闸指挥部特电毛主席、周总理报告这一巨大工程胜利完工。电文如下：
    荆江分洪区的太平口进洪闸于四月五日开工，到六月十八日已全部胜利完工。修太平口进洪闸历时七十多天，除雨天外，施工时间不到四十天。在这很短的时间内，我们就完成了这一包括几百万土方和八万五千公方混凝土工的巨大工程。现在，这座一千零五十四公尺长、五十四孔的现代化的巨型水闸，已像一座长城似地横卧在荆江南岸分洪区的进口处。
    由于您和中国共产党、中央人民政府的正确领导，由于八万工农兵发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热情，和各级地方党政组织的大力支援，我们取得了这个伟大的胜利。人们都惊讶着这是一个奇迹。在资本主义国家、殖民地国家和旧中国要在这样短的时间内修成这样大的工程是不可想像的，而且是难以置信的。今天在新中国出现这个奇迹，再次证明了新民主主义社会制度的优越性和勤劳勇敢智慧的劳动人民的无限力量。因此，这个光荣应首先属于您和全国人民。我们决不为这个伟大的胜利而骄傲自满，我们将详尽地总结施工中的经验和教训，作为我们争取祖国建设工程更大胜利的武器。感谢您的指示与关怀。
