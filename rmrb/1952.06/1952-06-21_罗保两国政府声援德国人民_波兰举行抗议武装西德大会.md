Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS, governments and people of various European People's Democratic countries have successively issued statements opposing the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty," supporting the Soviet Union's proposal on unifying Germany and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and supporting the struggle of the German people.
    The Romanian government issued a statement saying that the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty" signed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France with the Adenauer government created insurmountable difficulties for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany, rebuilt the German aggressor army headed by fascist Hitler generals, and dragged West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc. Thus, the United States, Britain, and France once again grossly violated their obligations under the Potsdam Agreement. The Romanian people, with justified indignation, are watching these bandits' conspiracies. They are determined to support with all their strength the struggle for a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany, and to oppose the imperialists' conspiracies aimed at deepening the division of Germany and rebuilding aggressive militarism in West Germany. The Romanian people wholeheartedly welcome the German people's struggle for a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany, and against the conspiracies of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France and the Adenauer government bandits. The Romanian government firmly supports the Soviet proposal in its note on the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany.
    The Bulgarian government issued a statement saying that the Bulgarian government believes that the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty" clearly violate the interests of peace-loving countries and threaten the peaceful development of European countries, and violently violate the Potsdam Agreement and the Yalta Agreement. Therefore, these treaties cannot be considered legitimate international treaties. The Bulgarian people oppose all attempts to revive aggressive German militarism in any way. The Bulgarian people wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's proposals in its note of May 24 this year regarding the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. The Bulgarian people warmly welcome the German people's heroic struggle for a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany, and for the complete defeat of the aggressive imperialist policies of the United States, Britain, and France and their puppet Adenauer.
    A national conference protesting the remilitarization of West Germany and striving for a peaceful solution to the German question was held in Poland. The conference passed a declaration to German patriots, saying that the Polish people fully support the German patriots' struggle against the so-called "General Treaty," against the remilitarization of West Germany, and for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The Polish people believe that this struggle is a major contribution of the German people to the struggle to defend world peace. The Polish people strive to further consolidate the friendly and fraternal comprehensive cooperation with the German Democratic Republic for the benefit of both Poland and Germany. We support every measure taken by the German Democratic Republic to strengthen its defense and security, because these measures serve the great cause of defending peace.

    罗保两国政府声援德国人民
    波兰举行抗议武装西德大会
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：欧洲各人民民主国家政府及人民相继发表声明，反对“一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团条约”，拥护苏联关于统一德国并缔结对德和约的主张，声援德国人民的斗争。
    罗马尼亚政府发表声明说：美、英、法三国政府与阿登纳政府签订的“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团条约”，对缔结对德和约及统一德国制造了难以克服的困难，重建了以法西斯希特勒将领为首的德国侵略军，并且把西德拉进了侵略性的北大西洋集团，因而美、英、法三国再次粗暴地违背了它们根据波茨坦协定所承担的义务。罗马尼亚人民怀着理由正当的愤慨，注视着这些匪徒的阴谋。他们决心以全力支持争取统一、民主、独立与爱好和平的德国的斗争，并且反对帝国主义者旨在加深德国分裂并在西德重建侵略性军国主义的阴谋。罗马尼亚人民全心全意地欢迎德国人民为争取统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国、为反对美、英、法三国政府及阿登纳政府匪徒的阴谋而进行的斗争。罗马尼亚政府坚决支持苏联照会中提出的关于立刻缔结对德和约，建立一个统一、民主、独立与爱好和平的德国以及占领军自德国撤退的建议。
    保加利亚政府发表声明说：保加利亚政府认为：“一般性条约”及“欧洲防务集团条约”显然违反爱好和平的各国人民的利益，使欧洲各国的和平发展受到威胁，横暴地破坏了波茨坦协定和雅尔塔协定。因此，这些条约决不能认为是合法的国际条约。保加利亚人民反对以任何方式恢复侵略性的德国军国主义的一切企图。保加利亚人民全心全意地拥护苏联政府在今年五月二十四日的照会中所提出的关于立即缔结对德和约，关于成立一个统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国、关于从德国撤退占领军的各项建议。保加利亚人民热忱地欢迎德国人民为争取统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国、为争取完全打败美、英、法三国及其傀儡阿登纳的侵略性的帝国主义政策而进行的英勇斗争。
    波兰举行全国抗议西德重新军国主义化及争取和平解决德国问题大会，大会通过告德国爱国分子宣言说：波兰人民完全支持德国爱国分子为反对所谓“一般性条约”、为反对西德重新军国主义化、为争取统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国而进行的斗争。波兰人民认为这个斗争是德国人民对于保卫世界和平的斗争的一大贡献。波兰人民力求为着波德两国的利益进一步巩固对德意志民主共和国的友好及兄弟般的全面合作。我们支持德意志民主共和国为加强它的防御与安全而采取的每一措施，因为这些措施是为保卫和平这一伟大事业而服务的。
