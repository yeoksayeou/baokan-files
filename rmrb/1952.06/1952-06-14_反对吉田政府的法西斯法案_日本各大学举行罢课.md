Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Echoing the Japanese workers' strike against the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill," Japanese students also held a nationwide strike on the 10th, expressing their determination to oppose this fascist bill.

On this day, many universities across Japan held separate or joint strikes, protest rallies, and demonstrations. According to statistics, in addition to universities in Tokyo, many schools such as Nagoya University, Yokohama National University, Aichi University, Hiroshima University, Miyazaki University, and Oita University participated in this struggle, with a total of 8,000 to 10,000 students. Students from Ochanomizu Women's University in Tokyo, despite the school authorities' ban, broke the school's stubborn conservative tradition of 73 years and joined the strike movement.

In Tokyo alone, about 4,000 students from ten universities, disregarding the school authorities' orders prohibiting gatherings and demonstrations on campus, converged at Waseda University and held a "General Uprising Rally Against the Anti-Subversive Activities Bill." At the meeting, students shouted slogans such as "Oppose the Anti-Subversive Activities Bill" and passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill" and demanding the reactionary Yoshida government resign immediately.

After the meeting, students also held demonstrations in the city. The march was suppressed by 400 policemen near Shibuya Station. According to the Associated Press, nine students participating in the demonstration were illegally arrested by the police.

    反对吉田政府的法西斯法案
    日本各大学举行罢课
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：和日本工人反对“防止破坏活动法案”的罢工斗争相呼应，日本学生也在十日举行了全国性的罢课，表示他们同样反对这一法西斯法案的决心。
    日本全国的许多大学在这一天分别或联合举行了罢课、抗议集会和示威游行。据统计，参加这次斗争的除了有东京各大学以外，还有名古屋大学、横滨国立大学、爱知大学、广岛大学、宫崎大学、大分大学等许多学校，共计有学生八千名到一万名。东京的御茶水女子大学的学生也不顾学校当局的禁令，打破了学校七十三年来的顽固的保守传统，参加了罢课运动。
    仅在东京一地，就有十个大学的学生约四千人，不顾学校当局禁止在校内集会示威的命令，汇合在早稻田大学，举行了“反对防止破坏活动法案总奋起大会”。学生们在会上高呼“反对防止破坏活动法案”的口号，并通过决议，要求废除“防止破坏活动法案”，要求反动的吉田政府立即辞职。
    会后，学生并在市区举行示威游行。游行队伍在涩谷车站附近遭到了四百名警察的镇压，据美联社讯，九名参加示威游行的学生被警察非法逮捕。
