    To the Editors:
    "June 1st" International Children's Day is coming. We imagine that the children of the motherland are greeting this happy day with great enthusiasm. We are Chinese students living in Korea. Our parents have been away from our beloved motherland for many years. In the past, we suffered from the oppression of Japanese imperialism. Fortunately, the Soviet Red Army uncles rescued us from the pit of fire. Under the leadership and love of General Kim Il-sung, we enjoy equal treatment, and our lives are becoming richer day by day. The American aggressors launched a war of aggression against Korea, burning, killing, looting, and destroying our good life everywhere. But no matter how crazy American imperialism is, its defeat is already doomed. The Korean people are a heroic people. Under the severe blows of the Chinese and Korean people, the American aggressor troops have suffered heavy casualties.
    Our school was bombed by the evil American imperialism, but we are strong and unyielding. We have officially started classes again in a house in the suburbs. Here, we have air-raid shelters we dug, books sent by the people of the motherland, and teachers sent by the motherland to lead us in our studies. In April this year, we added a library, which displays newspapers and books sent by the children of the motherland. We deeply thank Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland! On the occasion of celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day, we are determined to learn from the children of the motherland, and hope that you will often write to us to tell us about the construction of the motherland and the learning situation of the children.
                                All Students of Qingjin People's School, Korea

    侨居朝鲜的中国学生
    怀念着祖国的小朋友们
    编辑同志：“六一”国际儿童节到来了。想来祖国的小朋友们正以满怀的热情来迎接这个愉快的日子。我们是侨居朝鲜的中国学生，我们的父母离开亲爱的祖国已经多年了。我们过去受尽了日本帝国主义的压迫，幸亏苏联的红军叔叔把我们从火坑里拯救出来。我们在金日成将军的领导和热爱下，享受到了平等的待遇，生活一天天地富裕起来。美国侵略者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，到处烧杀掠夺，破坏了我们的美好生活。但是不论美国帝国主义如何疯狂，它的败局是已经注定了的。朝鲜人民是英雄的人民。在中朝人民的严重打击下，美国侵略军已遭受到了惨重的伤亡。
    我们的学校被万恶的美帝国主义炸毁了，但是我们是坚强不屈的，我们又在郊外一所房子里正式开课了。这里有我们挖好了的防空洞，有祖国人民送来的书籍，有祖国派来的教师领导我们学习。今年四月间，我们又增设了一个图书馆，里面陈列着祖国小朋友送来的书报。我们深深地感谢毛主席，感谢祖国人民！在庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的今天，我们决心向祖国的小朋友们学习，希望你们常常来信告诉我们关于祖国的建设和小朋友们的学习情况。
