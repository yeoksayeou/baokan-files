Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, June 8th: The Oriental Manuscript Museum of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is preparing to publish the first four volumes of the Russian translation of the famous Chinese "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government" (通鉴纲目). This was translated by the Russian scholar Bichurin in the last century but has never been published. The museum preserves the rich literary legacy of this outstanding scholar, who spent thirteen years in China deeply and extensively studying the language, culture, and life of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union is now publishing a selection of Bichurin's works, including "On Ancient Chinese Coins," "Consolidating the Dikes of the Yellow River," and "On Tea," all of which are of scientific interest.

    苏联将出版俄译“通鉴纲目”
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社列宁格勒八日讯：苏联科学院东方问题研究所东方手稿博物馆准备印行著名的中国“通鉴纲目”的俄文译本头四卷。这是由上一世纪的俄罗斯学者比邱林翻译的，但从未刊印过。博物馆保存有这位杰出学者丰富的文学遗产，他曾耗费了十三年的时间在中国深入而广泛地研究中国人民的语言、文化和生活。现在苏联正在刊印比邱林著作的选集，选集包括“谈中国古钱”、“巩固黄河堤坝”和“论茶”等作品，它们都是饶有科学趣味的。
