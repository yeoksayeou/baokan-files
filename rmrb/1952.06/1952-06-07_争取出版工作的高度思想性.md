Striving for a High Degree of Ideological Content in Publishing Work
*Pravda* Editorial

The enormous scale of our country's publishing industry is a sign of the Communist Party and the Soviet government's concern for satisfying the spiritual needs of the people. The total number of books published annually in the Soviet Union is almost ten times greater than the number of books published in pre-revolutionary Russia.

Soviet books should be highly ideological, rich in content, and of perfect literary form and standard. Our works, which actively support new and advanced things, expose bad phenomena and hypocritical figures, and help the Party educate the working people in the spirit of communism, have won the approval of the people.

The resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Comrade Stalin's instructions on ideological issues are the battle program for all workers of the Bolshevik press. The staff of publishing houses, like all our press workers, should follow the policies that constitute the foundation of the Soviet system. Our books should promote the ideas of Soviet patriotism, the ideas of friendship between nationalities, and should reflect the moral and political unity of Soviet society.

The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the magazines "Zvezda" and "Leningrad" states: "The strength of Soviet literature—the most advanced literature in the world—lies in the fact that it has no and cannot have any interests other than the interests of the people and the interests of the state. The task of Soviet literature is to help the state accurately educate young people, answer their questions, and educate a new generation to be spiritually strong, confident in their cause, unafraid of obstacles, and prepared to overcome any obstacles."

Publishing good books is the top priority for every Soviet publishing house. The success of any publishing house's work depends on the high and strict requirements for every book and every literary work to be published, and on constantly paying attention to improving their ideological, scientific, and artistic level.

Many of our publishing houses have implemented the Party's instructions and achieved significant successes in their work. At the same time, facts show that there are still serious errors and shortcomings in the work of individual publishing houses. For example, the work of the State Legal Publishing House is not satisfactory. The books it publishes do not meet the requirements of Soviet legal science and lag behind the needs of practical workers. Many books published by this publishing house, as already pointed out in the Party press, have serious ideological errors, and some of them are politically harmful. The publishing house is careless in selecting authors, allowing some people who cannot correctly solve problems and who do not have the necessary knowledge to write books.

Due to the indifference of the publishing house's leaders, the preparation for the publication of books on the government organizations of the People's Democratic countries has been monopolized by a small group of people with incorrect ideas. The serious errors in the publishing house's work primarily show that the editorial work here is not properly organized, lacks criticism and self-criticism, and creates a situation of tolerance and complacency.

Recently, the strict requirements for the quality of reprinting and editing works of Russian and foreign classical writers have been lowered by some publishing houses. Soviet readers want to obtain excellent versions of the works of classical and Soviet writers. This obliges the editors of published works to treat the published manuscripts carefully and cautiously. Unfortunately, many leaders of publishing houses have forgotten their responsibility to readers and often entrust the preparation of published literary works to inexperienced and insincere people.

Serious errors and distortions of the original text often occur during the reprinting of certain literary works. For example, the State Literary Publishing House and the Military Books Publishing House, when editing Demyan Bedny's anthology, took a domineering and unauthorized attitude towards the poet's original text. As a result, many of his poems were distorted, and in some places, the original text was simply a bourgeois liberal forgery. The editor of the anthology, Legenin, treated the work entrusted to him in an insincere manner: he included in the selected works not the poet's final drafts, but earlier works that had been criticized by the poet himself; he did not notice that Bedny had long since revised his works, and in many cases, this revision was completed under the influence of Party criticism. The leaders of the State Literary Publishing House and the Military Publishing House were irresponsible in the printing of Bedny's works, completely transferring this matter to editors who were ignorant of the original manuscripts, politically indifferent, and did not use their minds.

The perfunctory and irresponsible attitude towards publishing books can only be explained by contempt for readers and disregard for their interests. All staff of our publishing houses have a top priority task, which is to fight in the Bolshevik spirit for publications with a high degree of ideological, scientific, and artistic level. The interests of readers require that careful scientific preparation of the original text be ensured when reprinting works.

The success of things depends on people, depends on cadres. The leaders of publishing houses should establish due order in the work of writers, guide qualified experts to write books, arrange creative discussions well, and conduct serious reviews of manuscripts being prepared for publication.

Strengthening publishing houses with skilled and well-trained editors and publishing staff, improving the working ability of editors and publishing staff, and improving their education are important conditions for ensuring the quality of editing manuscripts. In this regard, the General Administration of Printing and Publishing should pay serious attention. In the past, it did not ensure supervision of the quality of publications, did not ensure the improvement of publishing work, and was not concerned about improving the political and specialized knowledge of editors.

The work of publishing houses is an important part of ideological work. Local Party organizations should pay constant attention to the work of publishing houses and should care about and improve the quality of publications. However, it should be pointed out that some Party committees have never given due attention to this matter. For example, when the Chkalov Publishing House and the Chita Publishing House planned to publish the anthology of the writer Mikhailov, Facheyev, who was responsible for editing the book, made crude mistakes in editing this book. However, the Chkalov and Chita All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Oblast Committees turned a blind eye to these errors of the publishing houses.

Party organizations should improve the leadership of local publishing houses, pay close attention to the content of their work, and strictly pay attention to the high degree of ideological content of books.

Our publishing houses have the possibility to gloriously and smoothly complete the serious and responsible tasks before them. The responsibility of the staff of Soviet publishing houses is to better meet the growing demands of the people, to do their best to improve the ideological level of publications, to bring the great ideas of the Party of Lenin and Stalin to the masses, and to promote the achievements of our motherland in the struggle for communism.

    争取出版工作的高度思想性
    真理报社论
    我国出版事业的巨大规模，就是共产党和苏维埃政府关怀满足人民精神需要的标志。苏联每年出版的书籍，其总数几乎超过革命前俄罗斯出版书籍数量的十倍。
    苏维埃的书籍应当是有高度思想性的，有丰富内容的，具有完美的文学形式和水平的出版物。我们的那些积极赞助新的和先进的事物、揭露坏现象和伪善人物的著作，帮助党用共产主义精神教育劳动人民的著作，都获得了人民的赞许。
    联共（布）中央委员会的决议，斯大林同志对思想问题的指示，是布尔什维克报刊全体工作人员行动的战斗纲领。出版局的工作人员，也像我们报刊全体工作人员一样，应当遵循着构成苏维埃制度生活基础的政策。我们的书籍应当宣传苏维埃爱国主义的思想，宣传各民族友爱的思想，并应反映出苏维埃社会的道德——政治的统一。
    联共（布）中央委员会关于“星”和“列宁格勒”杂志的决议中说：“苏维埃文学——世界上最先进的文学——的力量，就在于它除掉人民的利益，除掉国家的利益外，是没有而且也不可能有其他的利益的。苏维埃文学的任务就是在于帮助国家准确地教育青年，答复他们的询问，教育新的一代成为精神百倍，相信自己事业，不怕障碍，准备克服任何障碍的人。”
    出版好的书籍，是苏维埃每一个出版局的头等重要任务。任何一个出版局的工作的成功，决定于对所要出版的每本书、每本文学作品的高度的严格要求，决定于时时注意提高它们的思想、科学和艺术水平。
    我们许多出版局执行了党的指示，在其工作中获得了显著的成就。同时事实证明，在个别出版局的工作中，仍存在着严重的错误和缺点。例如，国立法律书籍出版局的工作就不能令人满意。它所出版的书籍不能适合于苏联法律科学的要求，落后于实际工作者的需要。这个出版局所出版的许多书籍，正如党报中已经指出来的，有着严重的思想上的错误，其中有些书在政治上是有害的。出版局在选择作者方面是草率的，让一些不能正确解决问题的、没有必要的知识的人来写书。
    由于出版局的领导者们漠不关心，关于人民民主国家的政府组织机构的书籍出版准备工作，为一小群思想不正确的人垄断了。出版局工作中的严重错误，首先说明了这里的编辑工作没有正确地组织起来，缺乏批评和自我批评，造成了宽容和自满的情况。
    近来，对俄国的和外国的古典作家文艺作品的再版工作和编辑工作质量的严格要求，为某些出版局降低了。苏联的读者是想要获得古典作家和苏联作家的创作的优良版本的。这责成出版作品的编辑们细心地和谨慎地去对待出版的原稿。可惜，许多出版局的领导者忘记了自己对读者的责任，时常把出版文学作品的准备工作委托给没有经验的和没有诚心的一些人去作。
    在某些文学作品再版的时候，时常发生严重的错误和对原文歪曲的地方。例如，国立文学出版局和军事书籍出版局在编辑杰米扬·别德内依文集时，就对这位诗人的原文采取了专横的擅自处理的态度，其结果，他的许多诗都被歪曲了，甚至有些地方的原文简直成了资产阶级自由主义的伪造。文集的编辑列吉宁用一种毫无诚意的态度对待所委托给他的工作：他收在选集中的，不是诗人最后的定稿，而是较早的，被诗人自己挑剔出去的作品；他没有注意到别德内依早已修改了自己的作品，在许多情况下这种修改是在党的批评影响下完成的。国家文学出版局和军事出版局的领导者，对待别德内依作品的付印工作是不负责任的，把这件事情完全转托给对原稿无知的、对政治漠不关心的和不用心思的编辑们。
    对出版书籍的粗枝大叶和不负责任的态度，除了蔑视读者，轻视他们的利益之外是不能再有其他解释的。在我们出版局的全体工作人员面前，有着一个头等重要的任务，这就是以布尔什维克的精神为争取具有高度思想、科学和艺术水平的出版物而斗争。读者们的利益是要求作品再版时，要保证作好对原文的细心的科学的准备工作。
    事情的成功决定于人，决定于干部。出版局的领导者应当在对作家的工作方面，建立起应有的秩序，引导有资格的专家来写书，要把创作讨论会安排得很好，并对准备出版的原稿作认真的审查。
    用熟练的和经过锻炼的编辑、出版工作人员来加强出版局，提高编辑、出版人员的工作能力，改善对他们的教育工作，是保证原稿的编辑质量的重要条件。在这一方面，印刷出版总局应该加以严重注意。过去，它没有保证对出版物质量的监督，没有保证改善出版工作，对于提高编辑的政治和专门知识的问题毫不关心。
    出版局的工作是思想工作的一个重要部分。地方党组织应当经常地注意出版局的工作，应当关怀和提高出版物的质量。但是，应当指出，某些党委会对于这件事从没有给予应有的注意。例如，在契卡洛夫出版局和赤塔出版局计划出版作家米哈依洛夫文集的时候，负责编辑工作的法切也夫就在编辑这本书时犯了粗暴的错误。但是契卡洛夫和赤塔联共（布）州委会对于出版局的这些错误熟视无睹。
    党组织应当改善对地方出版局的领导工作，深刻地注意它们工作的内容，严格地注意书籍的高度思想性。
    我们的出版局具有光荣地顺利地完成他们面前的严重的和负责的任务的可能性。苏联出版局工作人员的责任，就是要更好地满足人民增长着的要求，尽力提高出版物的思想水平，把列宁、斯大林党的伟大思想带给群众，宣传我们祖国在争取共产主义斗争中的成就。
