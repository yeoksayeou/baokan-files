(Xinhua News Agency, 18th) The unreasonable delay of the Korean armistice negotiations by the United States and the brutal massacre of Korean and Chinese war prisoners have aroused great dissatisfaction among the British people. British Defense Minister Alexander and Deputy Foreign Secretary Lloyd were dispatched from London on June 6 to Japan and South Korea to study "the critical situation that Churchill and his cabinet consider" (National News Agency). After arriving in Japan, Alexander and Lloyd held a "secret meeting" with Clark on the 12th. On the 13th, accompanied by Clark, they flew to Korea for "inspection."

Alexander and Lloyd were sent by the British government to ease the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people at home. As the US's deliberate delay and sabotage of the negotiations has brought the Korean armistice negotiations to a serious crisis, and the British government is still catering to this US policy, the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people in the UK has been increasing. Even many British bourgeois newspapers have reflected this sentiment. For example, the Labor Party's "Sunday Pictorial" commented on the 8th, saying: "An unavoidable fact facing Alexander and his colleagues in Korea is: this is a war that no one wants to fight, and no one can win. ... Frankly speaking, we are not happy about this war." The "Reynolds News" editorial wrote: "It is intolerable if we stand weakly aside and our destiny is manipulated by others. We must make it clear to the world that Britain must not be blindly and confusedly dragged into MacArthur's war of revenge like a blind man and a mute." According to a United Press report from London on the 12th, this state of public outrage has put the Churchill government "under increasing pressure from public opinion, Labor figures, and even some Conservative members themselves, demanding that Britain be more actively in control of developments on the Korean stage." Even "some people in the cabinet have openly expressed resentment at the practice of dispatching British troops to Geoje Island without consulting London in advance." (National News Agency, London, June 6th) Thus, Churchill had to hurriedly "personally order Alexander to set aside other affairs and rush to Korea." (National News Agency, London, June 6th)

According to a United Press report from London on the 12th, the specific purpose of Alexander and Lloyd's trip is to "demand that the United States allow Britain to have a greater say and participate in higher-level decisions of the United Nations Command in Korea," so as to ease the dissatisfaction of the British people. Alexander publicly stated when passing through Hong Kong on the 9th that if Clark proposed sending a British representative to participate in the armistice negotiations, "he would gladly agree."

It must be pointed out that under the circumstances that the British government blindly follows the US policy, it is impossible to alleviate the British people's dissatisfaction with the US side's delay in negotiations, tense situation, massacres, and attempts to detain prisoners of war. Even if a British representative participates in the negotiations, it will not play a significant role in improving the situation. Moreover, the US side is unwilling to allow Britain to participate in the negotiations because it is afraid of further exposing its ignorance and incompetence and fears that Britain will compete for its leadership. Therefore, despite the British Conservative government's best efforts to "maintain Anglo-American consistency on Korean strategy" and humbly cater to the United States, the US government has rejected this request. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 11th: "US officials confirmed that the United States is currently firmly opposed to expanding the number of member states of the United Nations Armistice Negotiation Delegation and does not approve of Britain sending representatives to participate." Thus, "The Times" had to sadly admit in its editorial on the 10th: "Neither Alexander nor Lloyd is likely to bring back optimistic news."

### 亚历山大和劳埃德在日本和朝鲜的活动决缓和不了英国人民对朝鲜局势的不满

    亚历山大和劳埃德在日本和朝鲜的活动决缓和不了英国人民对朝鲜局势的不满
    【新华社十八日讯】由于美国无理拖延朝鲜停战谈判和残暴屠杀朝中战俘的行为，已在英国广大人士中引起极大的不满，英国国防大臣亚历山大与外交副大臣劳埃德奉派于六月六日由伦敦启程到日本与南朝鲜，研究“邱吉尔及其内阁认为是危急的形势”（国新社）。亚历山大、劳埃德抵达日本后，曾于十二日与克拉克举行了“秘密会议”。十三日，并由克拉克伴同飞朝鲜“视察”。
    亚历山大与劳埃德是英国政府为了缓和国内广大人民的不满情绪而派遣的。在美国蓄意拖延、破坏谈判的政策已使朝鲜停战谈判面临严重危机，而英国政府仍然对美国的这种政策曲意逢迎的情况下，英国国内广大人民的不满情绪已经日益高涨起来。连许多英国资产阶级的报纸，也反映出了这种情绪。例如工党的“星期日报”在八日著论称：“亚历山大和他的同僚们在朝鲜面临的一个不可回避的事实是：这是一个没有人要打的、也是没有人能够赢得的战争。……坦白说来，我们对于这个战争并不感到愉快。”“雷诺新闻”社论写道：“如果我们软弱地站在一旁，而我们的命运由别人来摆布，这是不能容忍的。我们必须向全世界明白表明：英国决不能像瞎子与哑吧一样地糊里糊涂被拖入麦克阿瑟的报复战争中去。”这种群情激愤的情况，据合众社伦敦十二日电承认，使邱吉尔政府“受到舆论、工党人士和甚至某些保守党员自己的愈来愈大的压力，要求英国能更积极地控制朝鲜舞台上的发展”。甚至“内阁里面有些人对于事先不和伦敦方面协商即调遣英国军队去巨济岛的作法，也公然表示愤懑。”（国新社伦敦六日电）这样，邱吉尔就不得不慌忙地“亲自命令亚历山大摆脱其他事务，赶紧到朝鲜去”。（国新社伦敦六日电）
    亚历山大、劳埃德此行的具体目的，据合众社伦敦十二日电透露：是企图“要求美国让英国有比较大的发言权，参与朝鲜联合国军司令部的比较高级的决定”，这样来缓和英国人民的不满情绪。亚历山大九日在路过香港时，即曾公开表示：如果克拉克提出派遣一位英国代表参加停战谈判，“他将欣然同意”。
    必须指出：在英国政府一味追随美国政策的情况之下，英国人民对于美方拖延谈判，紧张局势，大批屠杀并企图扣留战俘的不满情绪是不可能缓和的。即使英国代表参加谈判，也不会对情况的改善起大作用。何况美方为了害怕更进一步暴露其无知无能，并害怕英国要争夺其领导权，对英国参加谈判是不愿意的。因此，尽管英国保守党政府极力企图“保持英美在朝鲜战略问题上的一致”，卑躬屈节逢迎美国，美国政府却拒绝了这种要求。据合众社华盛顿十一日电称：“美国官方人士证实，美国目前坚决反对扩大联合国停战谈判代表团的成员国，不赞成英国派代表参加。”这样，“泰晤士报”在十日的社论中就只好悲哀地承认：“无论亚历山大或者劳埃德都不可能会带回令人乐观的消息。”
