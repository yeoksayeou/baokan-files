[This newspaper's report] According to the Changjiang Daily: As of June 11th, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project had been 87.5% completed. Recently, the construction site has been sunny for several consecutive days. Hundreds of thousands of laborers continue to work with tense and joyful spirits, making a final assault on the engineering tasks. At present, the original planned concrete work of the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate has been victoriously completed in its entirety, and the newly added concrete engineering tasks can also be poured within days. Green grass has been planted on the new soil of the upstream and downstream apron revetments, forming a neat and beautiful lawn in front of the gate. All 54 gate arm supports have been installed, and the arduous riveting work in installing the gate doors has been completed for 46 of them. The winches for opening and closing the gates have been installed for 16 of them. The entire North Sluice Gate—the Taipingkou Flood Diversion Gate project—is more than 88% complete. The concrete pouring work for the South Sluice Gate—the Huangshantou Control Gate—has been 98.5% completed, and the earthwork for the dam has been 34.6% completed. The control gate has also been equipped with 30 gate doors, and the downstream revetment has begun to be built with riprap. The newly added upstream cut-off wall is being poured with concrete, and the gate winches are also being installed. The embankment project of the flood diversion area has been 94.8% completed. The North and South Sluice Gate Headquarters and the entire engineering labor force are full of confidence in completing all engineering tasks before June 18th.

Great post-completion preparations are underway at the Jingjiang Flood Diversion construction site. Most of the ships and machinery have begun demobilization. The Materials Clearing Committee is vigorously carrying out the clearing and transfer of materials. Many units have voluntarily organized to collect all scattered large and small equipment parts and useful items on the construction site to avoid waste, and resolutely implement the slogan of "clean the site after the work is completed."

Tens of thousands of migrant workers who have successfully completed their tasks, after evaluating merits, commending models, and receiving certificates of merit, awards, and glorious completion certificates, have embarked on their victorious journey home. Before leaving, they voluntarily increased their contributions of earthwork or stonework, and firmly expressed their determination to play a leading role in agricultural production.

The Jingjiang Dike is organizing mass pre-flood general inspection and processing work to further reinforce the dike body.

    荆江分洪工地上正在进行着巨大的善后准备工作。大部的船只和机器已开始复员。器材清理委员会正在大力进行清理、转运器材。很多单位自动组织起来，收拾一切散落在工地的大小器材零件和有用的东西，以免浪费，坚决贯彻“工完场清”的口号。
    胜利完成任务的数万民工，在评功、表扬模范、领到奖状奖品和光荣完工证后，踏上胜利归途。他们在临行前，自动地增献土方或石方工程，并坚决表示一定要在农业生产中起模范带头作用。
    荆江大堤正组织群众性的汛前普查加工工作，进一步加固堤身。
