    The Victory of Unity Between Tibetan and Han People in the Fourth District of Minxian and Dangchang
    Editor: I am reporting a joyous situation to you.
    The Fourth District of Minxian and Dangchang in Gansu Province is a region where Tibetan and Han ethnic groups live together. Before liberation, the Tibetan and Han people living here often had disputes. At that time, like the Han people, seventy to eighty percent of the Tibetan people living here had no land, or only very little land. They all relied on collecting firewood and burning charcoal to maintain their lives; when it rained or snowed, they could not go into the mountains and had to go hungry.
    Now, the situation has completely changed. During the land reform, the Tibetan and Han farmers united closely, overthrew the feudal landlord class, and jointly received land, houses, livestock, farm tools, and grain. In the distribution process, the Tibetan and Han farmers helped and yielded to each other, and the distribution was fair and reasonable. Due to hard work in production, the lives of the Tibetan and Han people are much better than before. They have also newly established schools. This year, they have already drawn up patriotic pledges, determined to strengthen national unity, work hard to increase production, and practice strict economy.

    岷县宕昌区第四乡藏汉两族人民团结的胜利
    编辑同志：我向你们报告一个令人喜悦的情况。
    甘肃省岷县宕昌区第四乡是个藏汉民族杂居的地区。解放以前，住在这里的藏汉两族的人民，常常发生纠纷。那时住在这里的藏族人民和汉族人民一样，十分之七、八没有土地，或者只有很少的土地。他们全靠打柴、烧炭来维持生活；下雨下雪时，不能进山，只好饿肚子。
    现在，情况完全改变了。在土地改革中，藏汉两族的农民亲密团结，打倒了封建地主阶级，共同分到了土地、房屋、牲畜、农具和粮食。在分配过程中，藏汉两族的农民互助互让，分得公平合理。由于努力生产，藏汉两族人民的生活比以前好多了。他们还新成立了学校。今年，他们已经订好了爱国公约，决心加强民族团结，努力增加生产，厉行节约。　民禾
