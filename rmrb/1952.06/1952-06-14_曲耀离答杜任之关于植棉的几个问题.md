Qu Yaoli Answers Du Renzhi's Questions About Cotton Planting

Du Renzhi, Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, discovered several problems in cotton planting during his inspection of spring plowing in southern Shanxi: (1) In the past, the masses planted only 1,800 to 2,200 plants per mu of cotton field; this year, the government, based on advanced Soviet experience and Qu Yaoli's experience, advocated dense planting (3,000 to 3,500 plants per mu), and some people are skeptical of this method; (2) After planting cotton, some cotton seedlings emerge fully, some do not emerge fully, and some have not emerged at all; (3) The masses have different opinions on the types and amounts of fertilizer applied to cotton fields, and they do not know what is the most reasonable; (4) How to prepare to eliminate cotton aphids. In order to solve these problems, Du Renzhi specially visited Qu Yaoli, a national cotton planting model, in Jie County. Qu Yaoli's cotton seedlings emerged fully, and were lush and green. Qu Yaoli was hoeing the first seedlings. Du Renzhi asked Qu Yaoli several questions, and Qu Yaoli answered them one by one. Now we write down their conversation for the reference of cotton farmers in various places.

Du asked: Along the way, I saw that some cotton seedlings emerged fully, some did not emerge fully, some emerged early, some emerged late, and some have not emerged until now. What is the reason for this?

Qu replied: To ensure that cotton seedlings emerge fully, in addition to paying attention to seed selection, you should also pay attention to mastering the appropriate depth when sowing. It is best to soak the seeds in warm water before sowing, then take them out and mix them with firewood ash. The time for mixing seeds can be flexible. If you don't need to sprout early, soak them slightly, then take them out and let them cool before sowing; if you need to sprout early, soak the seeds for a little over an hour, then take them out, pile them up, cover them with sacks, and sow them after they heat up for more than a day, and they will sprout four or five days earlier. My cotton fields emerged about seven days after sowing, and were relatively complete, because I used this method. Some people are afraid of trouble and soak the seeds in cold water, so the cotton seedlings have not emerged until now. If they do not emerge in two days or do not emerge completely, they will have to replant or transplant seedlings, which is even more troublesome. I use firewood ash to mix seeds. One household in our village used fertilizer powder to mix seeds, and another used soybean cake to mix seeds, but the cotton seedlings did not emerge because they were burned to death.

Du asked: What are the benefits of dense planting? How many plants per mu is just right? Please tell me your opinion.

Qu replied: The cotton plants in densely planted fields produce bolls that can all bloom, resulting in a larger harvest. Last year, my cotton fields generally had more than 2,700 plants per mu, and more than 3,100 plants per mu in high-yield areas. Some people only want the cotton seedlings to be strong and large, and plant only 1,800 to 2,200 plants per mu. Although each plant has many cotton bolls, they cannot fully open. In the end, the number of bolls is still small, and the harvest is also small. This year, I planted 3,500 cotton plants per mu in high-yield areas, with a row spacing of 1.8 chi and a plant spacing of 9 cun, with three thinnings. Ten days after the seedlings emerge (this year, they grow slowly due to the slightly cooler weather), thin them once by hand, thin them once with a hoe in five or six days, and finally thin them in eight or nine days. This is the method of protecting seedlings. Last year, each plant produced 22 bolls. This year, there are 400 more plants per mu, which may produce more than 8,000 more bolls. Calculating 80 cotton bolls per jin of seed cotton, the yield can be increased by more than 100 jin of seed cotton. It is estimated that each mu of high-yield land can produce more than 1,000 jin. If the use of bone fertilizer this year reduces boll shedding of cotton plants, high yields will be even more guaranteed.

Du asked: How much fertilizer did you apply per mu of your cotton field this year? How much topdressing fertilizer will you apply later? What kind of fertilizer will you apply?

Qu replied: Fertilization should be properly applied as base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer should be applied in a timely manner. This year, my high-yield cotton field applied six large carts (about 10,000 jin) of base fertilizer per mu, including four carts of manure and two carts of sheep manure, as well as 50 jin of bone fertilizer. After the base fertilizer is fully applied, I also plan to apply topdressing fertilizer. Apply 30 jin of fertilizer powder for topdressing, and flexibly control it according to the situation, using it about three times (once during the Mangzhong solar term, once half a month later, and once during flowering). After each topdressing, cover with soil and water to quickly dissolve the fertilizer, fully exert its fertilizer effect, and make it easy for cotton plants to absorb. Hoeing should be done a total of eight or nine times, about three times before wheat harvest, and then five or six times until boll formation.

Du asked: The weather was warm last winter, and many insect eggs did not freeze to death. Wheat aphids were discovered in southern Shanxi this spring, but fortunately, the masses worked together to eliminate them completely. Cotton aphids are also likely to occur early this year. How do you plan to eliminate possible cotton aphids and ensure a bumper cotton harvest?

Qu replied: We have prepared more than one jin of pesticides per mu on average. We have 666, DDT, tobacco leaves, and cotton oil soap, and we have enough sprayers. As soon as we find cotton aphids, we can eliminate them cleanly in a short time. If cotton aphids are found when the cotton seedlings are still tender, you can spray with tobacco leaf water first, so as not to harm the cotton seedlings.

Du said: I wish your high-yield cotton a victory of exceeding 1,000 jin! Qu said: There are many people competing this year. I have received many letters from farmers who say that they guarantee a high yield of 1,050 jin of cotton per mu and challenge me. Let's learn from each other, work hard to produce, and strive for a national victory in high yield! (Recorded by Han Zhaozhang)

    曲耀离答杜任之关于植棉的几个问题
    山西省财政经济委员会秘书长杜任之到晋南检查春耕工作时，在植棉方面发现了几个问题：（一）群众过去的棉田每亩只植一千八百至二千二百株；今年政府根据苏联先进经验和曲耀离经验，提倡密植（每亩植三千至三千五百株），有些群众怀疑这种方法；（二）种棉后，棉苗有的出的齐全，有的出的不齐全，还有一些没有出苗；（三）群众对于棉田施肥的种类、多少，说法不一，不知道怎样才算最合理；（四）如何准备消灭棉蚜。杜任之为了解决这些问题，特地到解县访问了全国植棉模范曲耀离。曲耀离的棉苗出的齐全，油绿可爱。曲耀离正在锄初次苗。杜任之向曲耀离提出几个问题，曲耀离一一作了答复。现在把他们的谈话写出来，供各地棉农参考。
    杜问：我一路看见棉苗有出的齐全的，有出的不齐全的，有出的早的，有出的晚的，还有直到现在没有出苗的，这是什么原因？
    曲答：要棉苗出的齐全，除注意选种外，应该在下种时注意掌握深浅适度才好。种籽最好在下种前用温水浸种，然后捞出来用柴灰拌起。拌种时间可以灵活，如不需要早出，稍微浸一下，就可以捞出，凉一凉再下种；如需要早出，种籽浸上一点多钟，然后把它捞出来堆起，用麻袋盖住，放一日多，发热以后下种，就可早出四五天。我的棉田在下种后约七天就出苗，而且比较齐全，就是用的这个办法。有的人怕麻烦，用冷水浸种，所以到现在棉苗还没有出来，如过两天出不来或出不全，他们还得补种或补苗，那就更麻烦了。我用柴灰拌种。我村有一家用肥田粉拌种，一家用豆饼拌种，棉苗都没有出来，是烧死了。
    杜问：密植有什么好处？每亩多少株才算恰好？请你讲讲你的意见。
    曲答：密植的棉株结的桃，全能开花，收成较大。我的棉田，去年每亩一般植二千七百多株，丰产地植三千一百多株。有的人只图棉苗壮大，每亩只植一千八百到二千二百株，各株棉桃虽多，但不能完全开放，总算起来，桃数还是少，收成也小。我今年在丰产地每亩植棉三千五百株，行距尺八，株距九寸，三次定苗。苗出十天以后（今年因天气稍凉长得慢）用手间苗一次，过五六天用锄间苗一次，过八九天最后定苗。这是保苗的办法。去年每株生二十二个桃，今年每亩多四百株，可能多长八千多个桃，以八十个棉桃合一斤籽棉计算，就可增产一百多斤籽棉。估计丰产地每亩可产一千多斤。如果因今年使用骨肥而使棉株减少落桃，丰产就更有保证了。
    杜问：你的棉田今年每亩施肥多少？以后上追肥多少？施什么肥？
    曲答：施肥要底肥恰当，追肥适时。今年我的丰产棉田，每亩施底肥六大车（约一万多斤），其中圈粪四车，羊粪两车，还有骨肥五十斤。底肥施饱了还准备施追肥。追肥施肥田粉三十斤，根据情况机动掌握，约分三次使用（芒种节一次，半月后一次，开花时再一次）。每次施追肥后，就盖土，浇水，使肥料很快溶化，充分发挥肥效，棉株易于吸收。锄田总共要锄八九次，约麦收前锄三遍，以后锄五六遍，一直锄到结桃时为止。
    杜问：去年冬天天气温暖，很多虫卵都没有冻死，晋南今年春天发现麦蚜，幸亏群众一齐动手才把它扑灭干净。今年棉蚜也很可能早发生。你准备怎样消灭可能发生的棉蚜，保证棉花丰产？
    曲答：我们平均每亩准备了一斤多农药，六六六，滴滴涕，烟叶，棉油皂都有，喷雾器也够使用。一发现棉蚜，我们就能在短时间内把它消灭干净。如在棉苗还嫩的时候就发现棉蚜虫，可先用烟叶水喷，这样不至伤害棉苗。
    杜说：预祝你的丰产棉花获得超过一千斤的胜利！曲说：今年赛跑的人多着哩，我已经接到许多农民来信，都说保证每亩要丰产棉花一千零五十斤，向我挑战。大家相互学习，努力生产，争取全国丰产的胜利吧！  （韩照章记录）
