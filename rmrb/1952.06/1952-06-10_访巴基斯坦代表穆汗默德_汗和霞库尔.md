    Visits to Pakistani Representatives Muhammad Khan and Shakur

    Our reporter interviewed Ghulam Muhammad Khan and Shakur, the Pakistani representatives attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    "The people of Pakistan need peace. Peace organizations at all levels have been established, and the peace movement is developing faster and faster every day." Muhammad Khan summarized the current situation of the peace movement in Pakistan to the reporter. Muhammad Khan is the Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan Peace Committee. He has traveled around giving peace speeches. He said, "At a peace rally in Lahore—an ancient city—more than 50,000 people participated. This reflects the people's urgent desire for peace and their enthusiastic participation in peace rallies." Ghulam Muhammad Khan emphasized the breadth of the peace movement. Participants in the peace movement include ordinary workers, professors, writers, doctors, lawyers... people from all walks of life. Prominent figures such as the former premiers of Bengal and Sindh provinces have joined the ranks of peace, and several members of the National Assembly and provincial assembly have also signed the peace declaration.

    When the topic turned to the holding of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, Ghulam Muhammad Khan said excitedly: "The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is a great encouragement and impetus to the peace movements in Pakistan and other Asian countries. Now that the preparatory meeting for the peace conference has successfully concluded, our Pakistani people will greet the upcoming peace conference with a broader peace movement."

    Ghulam Muhammad Khan also talked about how to strengthen friendship between Pakistan and China. He said, "Pakistan and China are geographically connected, and the cultures of the two countries are closely related. Moreover, the friendship between the people of Pakistan and China is growing day by day. The establishment of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association and the Pakistan-China Cultural Association is proof of this. There are many ways to promote the friendship between the two peoples. Sending delegations to visit each other is a good way to strengthen mutual understanding and enhance the friendship between the two peoples." He also said that after returning home this time, he will definitely do his best to further promote and develop the traditional friendship between the people of Pakistan and China.

    Shakur is the Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association and the Vice-Chairman of the Karachi Peace Committee, the capital of Pakistan.

    He told the reporter: "Our country, Pakistan, is a young country, only five years old since its establishment. We face some huge problems. We want to modernize our agriculture; our industry has no foundation, and we want to build various industries; illiteracy is a big problem in Pakistan, and we want to massively develop our education; our health services are very substandard, and we want to properly expand our medical supply facilities. We must increase production in industry and agriculture to improve the living standards of the people. Therefore, we urgently need arduous and sustained construction work. If our country and the world do not have peace, construction work cannot be carried out. This is why our people yearn for peace."

    Shakur also briefly introduced the development of the peace movement in Pakistan: "The peace movement in Pakistan began in 1949. In that year, under the joint call of the Progressive Writers Association, trade union organizations, and democratic groups, Karachi held its first peace conference. In addition, several peace rallies were held in Karachi, Lahore, and other places, with a large number of participants. In 1950, the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign was launched, and more than 70,000 signatures were collected. Later, we collected more than 80,000 signatures on the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact.

    "The peace movement in Pakistan faces some difficulties and obstacles, some of which are man-made. We are overcoming these difficulties. The people of Pakistan are gradually realizing the necessity of the peace movement, and the number of people participating in this movement is increasing. It should be explained that the number of signatures collected twice is not enough to truly represent the number of Pakistani people who long for peace and are enthusiastic about defending peace. The number of Pakistani people who are ardent supporters of the peace movement is far greater than this. Many of them still have some concerns about publicly participating in this movement. We are confident that these concerns will gradually be eliminated.

    "We held a signature campaign in support of the Vienna resolution on the independence and freedom of the Middle East and North African countries. Recently, we launched a signature campaign against bacteriological warfare in Korea. The chairman of the Karachi Peace Committee convened a press conference and issued a declaration protesting against bacteriological warfare. Reports on this press conference were published in many newspapers. Many newspapers in Pakistan also wrote editorials denouncing bacteriological warfare. The Karachi Peace Committee also distributed leaflets and appeals to inform the people of the serious crimes of bacteriological warfare and its harm to Asian countries.

    "The Pakistan Peace Committee has recently been reorganized. We now have a provincial peace committee in each province. In order to coordinate the work of the provincial peace committees, we recently organized a central committee, called the National Peace Committee of Pakistan. This was decided at the All-Pakistan Peace Conference held in Lahore from May 17th to 19th this year. We hope that after this adjustment, the peace movement in Pakistan can have further new developments in the future." Shakur finally emphasized: "The reaction of the Pakistani people to the proposal to hold the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is very enthusiastic." He specially took out a Pakistani newspaper he brought with him. This newspaper published the resolution passed by the All-Pakistan Peace Conference in May this year welcoming and responding to the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Then, he said confidently: "China has 500 million people, India has more than 340 million people, Pakistan and Indonesia each have more than 75 million people..., Asia accounts for more than half of the world's population. If the people of Asia and the people of the Pacific countries unite to defend peace, then peace in Asia and the Pacific region can be guaranteed, and world peace can also be greatly guaranteed."

    访巴基斯坦代表穆汗默德·汗和霞库尔
    记者访问了出席这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的巴基斯坦代表吴拉姆·穆汗默德·汗和霞库尔。
    “巴基斯坦人民需要和平，各级和平组织已经成立了，和平运动正在一天比一天更快地发展着。”穆汗默德·汗向记者概括地说明了巴基斯坦和平运动的当前情况。穆汗默德·汗是巴基斯坦和平委员会的副主席。他曾旅行各地进行和平演说，他说，“在拉合尔——一个古老的城市的一次和平集会，便有五万多人参加，这反映了人民要求和平的殷切愿望，也反映了人民参加和平集会的热烈情绪。”吴拉姆·穆汗默德·汗着重指出和平运动的广泛性。参加和平运动的人士有普通的劳动者、有教授、作家、医生、律师……各界人士，孟加拉及新德两省的前总理等著名人士参加了和平行列，若干名国会及省议会议员也在和平宣言上签了名。
    当话题谈到举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的时候，吴拉姆·穆汗默德·汗兴奋地说：“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，对巴基斯坦和亚洲各国的和平运动是一个很大的鼓舞和推动。现在和平会议的筹备会议胜利闭幕了，我们巴基斯坦人民将以更广阔的和平运动来迎接不久到来的和平会议的召开。”
    吴拉姆·穆汗默德·汗还谈到如何加强巴、中友谊问题。他说：“巴基斯坦和中国国土相联，两国文化也有着密切联系，而且巴中人民的友谊是日益增进了。现在，巴基斯坦已成立了巴中友好协会和巴中文化协会的组织，便是一个证明。促进两国人民的友谊有许多办法，两国人民相互派代表团进行访问，便是加强两国人民相互了解，增进两国人民友谊的一个好办法。”他并表示此次归国后，一定要尽自己的努力来进一步促进和发展巴中人民的传统友谊。
    霞库尔是巴中友好协会的副主席，巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩和平委员会副主席。
    他向记者说：“我们的国家，巴基斯坦是年轻的国家，成立以来才只五年。我们面对着一些巨大的问题。我们要使我国的农业现代化；我国的工业是没有什么基础的，我们要把各种工业建设起来；文盲在巴基斯坦是一个大问题，我们要使我国的教育事业大量地发展；我国的卫生事业很不合格，我们要好好扩充我国医药供应的设备。我们在工业和农业方面都要增加生产来提高人民的生活水平。因此我们迫切地需要着艰苦持久的建设工作。如果我国和全世界没有和平，建设工作是无法进行的。这就是我国人民渴望和平的原因。”
    霞库尔又扼要地介绍了巴基斯坦保卫和平运动的发展情况：“巴基斯坦和平运动是在一九四九年开始的。那一年，在进步作家协会，各工会组织和各民主团体的联合号召之下，喀拉蚩举行了第一次和平大会。此外，喀拉蚩，拉合尔及其他各地还举行了几次和平集会，参加人数都很多。一九五○年发动了斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动，所征集的签名人数到达七万人以上。后来在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上，我们又征集了八万多人的签名。 “巴基斯坦和平运动面对着一些困难和障碍，有些困难是人为的。我们正在克服这些困难。巴基斯坦人民逐渐地认识到和平运动的必要性，参加这个运动的人数是愈来愈多了。应该说明两次所征集签名人数并不足以真正代表渴望和平以及热心于保卫和平的巴基斯坦人民的数量。人数远大于此的巴基斯坦人民是和平运动的热烈拥护者。其中有许多人还对公开参加这个运动有些顾虑，我们确信这种顾虑是会逐渐消除的。
    “我们举行过一次拥护关于中东及北非国家的独立、自由问题的维也纳决议的签名运动。最近我们发动了反对在朝鲜进行细菌战的签名运动。喀拉蚩和平委员会主席召集了一次记者招待会，发出一个宣言，对细菌战表示抗议。关于这次记者招待会的报道是在许多种报纸上发表了。巴基斯坦有好多报纸还撰写社论痛斥细菌战。喀拉蚩和平委员会还散发了一些传单和呼吁书，向人民说明细菌战的严重罪恶及其对于亚洲国家的危害。
    “巴基斯坦和平委员会最近已经改组了。现在我们在每省都设有一个省区的和平委员会。为了联系各省和平委员会的工作，我们最近组织了一个中央委员会，名为巴基斯坦全国和平委员会，这是今年五月十七日到十九日在拉合尔举行的全巴基斯坦和平大会所决定的。我们希望经过了这一番调整，今后巴基斯坦和平运动能有更进一步的新的发展。”霞库尔最后强调说：“巴基斯坦人民对于举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的建议的反应是很热烈的。”他特意找出他随身带来的一份巴基斯坦报纸，这张报纸上便登载着今年五月间全巴基斯坦和平大会所通过的欢迎与响应召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议。接着他充满信心地说：“中国有五亿人口，印度有三亿四千多万人口，巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚各有七千五百多万人口……，全亚洲占世界人口的二分之一以上。如果亚洲人民和太平洋各国人民都团结起来保卫和平，那么亚洲和太平洋区域的和平是可以得到保证的，同时世界和平也可以得到了很大的保障。”（林列、力文）
