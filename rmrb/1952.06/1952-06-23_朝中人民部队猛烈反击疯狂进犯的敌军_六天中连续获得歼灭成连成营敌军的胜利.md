Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 22nd: In the six days from the 15th to the 20th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers launched a series of counterattacks against frantically advancing enemy troops, continuously annihilating enemy units at the company and battalion levels.

	In the area west of Tieyuan, a certain unit of our army launched a courageous counterattack against two hilltop positions late on the 15th, with the cooperation of fierce artillery fire, annihilating an entire battalion of the US aggressor army's 45th Division occupying the area, killing and wounding nearly a thousand enemy soldiers. On the night of the 20th, our army launched another counterattack against the Shixian Cave area west of Tieyuan. The soldiers charged onto the enemy's hilltop positions, which were covered with barbed wire and log obstacles, and completely annihilated a company of the US 45th Division. Thus, since the US aggressor army's 45th Division began its frantic advance into the area west of Tieyuan on the 8th of this month, it has been annihilated by our defending forces to the tune of an entire battalion, three entire companies, and one entire platoon.

	In the area east of the central front, a certain unit of our army launched a fierce artillery bombardment on an enemy hilltop position east of Jin Cheng late on the 15th. Then, a heroic assault force stormed the hilltop, completely annihilating two platoons of the defending enemy. In the area southeast of Jin Cheng, another infantry unit of our army, with the cooperation of dense artillery fire, counterattacked a high ground. After only twelve minutes of fierce fighting, they annihilated most of a company of the Li pseudo-army entrenched on the hilltop, killing and wounding more than a hundred enemy soldiers. On the 19th, an enemy battalion, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced on the area, launching more than twenty consecutive assaults, all of which were repelled by our closely coordinated infantry and artillery units. Later, the enemy added another battalion of troops and continued its frantic advance on the area, but was still heroically repelled by our army. In this fierce blocking battle, our army killed and wounded more than five hundred enemy soldiers.

	In other areas of the front, our army continued to repulse multiple enemy advances. On the eastern front, a certain unit of our army repelled a battalion of enemy troops' attacks for more than seven consecutive hours in the Yandong area west of Wendeng-ri on the 18th, killing and wounding more than one hundred and twenty enemy soldiers. In the course of combat, our artillery units destroyed a total of three enemy artillery positions, destroyed four enemy mountain guns, three howitzers, and destroyed one enemy ammunition depot.

    朝中人民部队猛烈反击疯狂进犯的敌军
    六天中连续获得歼灭成连成营敌军的胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】在十五日到二十日的六天中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军向疯狂进犯的敌军进行了一连串的反击战，不断地歼灭成连成营的敌军。
    在铁原以西地区，我军某部十五日深夜在猛烈炮火配合下，向两个山头阵地发起勇猛反击，一举将占据该地的美国侵略军第四十五师一个营全部歼灭，杀伤敌军近千名。二十日夜，我军又向铁原以西石岘洞地区进行反击，战士们以勇猛的动作冲上满布铁丝网、鹿砦的敌军山头阵地，又全歼美军第四十五师一个连。至此，自本月八日开始向铁原以西地区疯狂进犯的美国侵略军第四十五师，已被我守军歼灭一个整营三个整连和一个整排。
    在中线偏东地区，我军某部十五日深夜向金城以东敌军的一个山头阵地发射猛烈炮火，接着英勇的突击部队就杀上这个山头，将守敌两个排全部歼灭。在金城东南地区，我军另一支步兵部队在密集炮火配合下，反击一个高地，仅仅经过十二分钟激战，即将盘踞在山头上的李伪军一个连大部歼灭，毙伤敌军一百多名。十九日，敌军一个营在炮火掩护下向该地进犯，连续二十多次冲锋，都被我严密配合作战的步兵部队和炮兵部队击退。后来敌军又增加一个营兵力继续向该地疯狂进犯，仍被我军英勇击退。在这次激烈的阻击战中，我军共杀伤敌军五百多名。
    在前线其他地区，我军继续打退敌军多次进犯。东线我军某部十八日在文登里以西岩洞地区击退一个营敌军连续七个多小时的攻击，杀伤敌军一百二十多名。我军炮兵部队在作战中，共摧毁敌军炮兵阵地三处，击毁敌军山炮四门，榴弹炮三门，并击毁敌军弹药所一处。
