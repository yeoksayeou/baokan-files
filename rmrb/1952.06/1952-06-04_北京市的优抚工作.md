After the Chinese People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Headquarters issued the call on June 1, 1951, regarding doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, the broad masses of Beijing realized that doing a good job in preferential treatment work was a practical patriotic action to resist America, aid Korea, and strengthen national defense. An upsurge of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers quickly formed throughout the city. Beijing conducted two comprehensive inspections of preferential treatment work throughout the city in June and around the "August 1st" Army Day last year. The leading organs understood the situation of preferential treatment work, discovered shortcomings in the work, and formulated plans to improve it, changing the past situation of being rushed and passive. In July, people from all walks of life established municipal and district preferential treatment work committees, making the development of preferential treatment work even smoother. In order to improve the political awareness of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the government also organized political study classes for the families of martyrs and soldiers, with more than 1,800 people participating in the study successively. Through study, they recognized the glory of being families of martyrs and soldiers and the role they should play among the masses, and criticized the ideas of some families of martyrs and soldiers who took credit for their status and relied on the government. In order to cultivate the employment conditions of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the government also organized them to learn skills. At present, Beijing's preferential treatment work has achieved great results. This is mainly reflected in:

I. The social and political status of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers has been generally improved. According to statistics, nine family members of martyrs and soldiers were elected as representatives to the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, eighty-three were elected as representatives to the District People's Congress, six were elected as members of the District People's Government, two were elected as deputy district heads, and 370 were elected as representatives of street organizations. All aspects of society automatically provide preferential treatment and care to the families of martyrs, soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. People from all walks of life have also incorporated preferential treatment work into patriotic covenants. 2,645 children of martyrs and soldiers have priority in enrollment. 1,340 families of martyrs and soldiers have received reduced or exempted medical expenses. During festivals and anniversaries, stores offer discounts to the families of martyrs and soldiers. Some citizens automatically reduce or waive rent for the families of martyrs and soldiers, or help them with lighting fires, cooking, washing clothes, carrying water, taking care of children, and sweeping the yard, while others automatically send rice, meat, and coal to the families of martyrs and soldiers. They take various actions to care for the families of martyrs and soldiers and often comfort them. This makes the families of martyrs and soldiers and the masses feel the glory of being a family member of a martyr or soldier, and improves the social status of the families of martyrs and soldiers.

II. A large number of families of martyrs, soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers have been organized to participate in production or have been introduced to jobs. Beijing currently has 25,380 households and 100,226 people who are families of martyrs, soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, making it the city with the largest number of families of martyrs and soldiers among major cities in the country. Past work experience has proven that organizing the families of martyrs and soldiers in urban areas to engage in production and introducing them to employment is the best way to solve their livelihood problems. Beijing currently has 37 production organizations for the families of martyrs and soldiers, including clothing, sewing, binding, and burlap sacks, with 1,492 family members of martyrs and soldiers participating in production. In 1951, the profit (including wages) was 3,544,346,500 yuan, exceeding 66% of the total amount of preferential grain distributed throughout the year. If the monthly living expenses per person are calculated at 60,000 yuan, it can solve the annual living problems of 4,922 people. In terms of job introductions, as of April 1952, 5,130 people (including temporary workers) had been introduced to work in government agencies, people's organizations, factories, and schools. If we calculate that each employed person supports an average of 2.5 people (including the employed person), it can solve the living problems of 12,825 people. In addition, various districts have organized a total of 1,206 military family members to participate in accounting, sewing, and other technical studies. This lays the foundation for the employment of military families.

A fixed system of substitute farming has been implemented for the families of martyrs and soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers in suburban areas who lack labor; a contract farming system has been adopted for the orphaned, elderly, and those without labor. The shortcomings of temporary dispatch of labor have been basically overcome, and timely cultivation has been achieved, so that the land yield of the families of martyrs and soldiers is generally not lower than that of ordinary farmers.

III. In terms of issuing preferential grain, Beijing has adopted the method of focusing on key use, and this method has proven to be effective. Based on the living conditions of the families of martyrs and soldiers, the number of households and the amount of grain to be given preferential treatment are determined through discussions by representatives of the families of martyrs and soldiers, group leaders, etc., and are distributed quarterly or monthly. There are 8,763 households and 23,181 people in the city enjoying in-kind preferential treatment, accounting for 23% of the total number of families of martyrs and soldiers in the city. Due to the results of organizing production and introducing employment, the number of households enjoying preferential treatment has decreased by 11% compared to the end of 1950. The total amount of preferential grain issued throughout the year last year was 2,132,461,200 yuan, which basically solved the living problems of the families of martyrs and soldiers throughout the city.

Beijing's preferential treatment work has made great achievements in the past year. However, there are still shortcomings. For example, the employment problem of individual elderly or less educated military family members has not been well resolved; the in-kind preferential treatment has not been fully focused on key use to maximize its effectiveness. These shortcomings need to be corrected as soon as possible in order to improve the preferential treatment work a step further on the existing basis.

    北京市的优抚工作
    一九五一年六月一日抗美援朝总会发出关于作好优待烈属、军属的号召以后，北京市广大群众都认识到做好优抚工作是抗美援朝、加强国防的一种实际爱国行动。拥军优属活动很快在全市形成热潮。北京市曾在去年六月及“八一”节前后对全市优抚工作进行了两次全面大检查，领导机关了解了优抚工作的情况，发现了优抚工作中的缺点，订出了改进这一工作的计划，改变了过去忙乱、被动的状况。七月份各界人民又成立了市、区优抚工作委员会，使优抚工作的开展更加顺利。为了提高烈属、军属的政治觉悟，政府又组织了烈属、军属政治学习班，先后有一千八百余人参加了学习。通过学习，他们认识了烈属、军属的光荣和在群众中应起的作用，批判了某些烈属、军属居功和依赖政府的思想。为了培养烈属、军属的就业条件，政府还组织他们学习技术。目前，北京市的优抚工作已经取得了很大的成绩。这主要表现在：
    一、烈属、军属、革命残废军人的社会、政治地位普遍提高。据统计，烈属、军属被选为市各界人民代表会议代表的九人，被选为区各界人民代表会议代表的八十三人，被选为区人民政府委员的六人，被选为副区长的二人，被选为街道团体代表的三百七十人。社会各方面对烈属、军属、革命残废军人都自动进行优待和照顾。各阶层人民并纷纷将优抚工作订入爱国公约中。烈士、军人子弟优先入学的有两千六百四十五人。烈属、军属治病，得到减免医药费优待的有一千三百四十人。在年节、纪念日，商店减价，优待烈属、军属。有的市民对烈属、军属自动减免房租，或帮助生火、做饭、洗衣、担水、看孩子、扫院子，有的则自动给烈属、军属送米、送肉、送煤等，他们以各种不同的行动来照顾烈属、军属，并经常慰问烈属、军属。这样就使烈属、军属和群众都感到做烈属、军属的光荣，提高了烈属、军属的社会地位。
    二、组织大批烈属、军属、革命残废军人参加了生产或介绍他们参加了工作。北京市现有烈属、军属、革命残废军人两万五千三百八十户、十万零二百二十六人，是全国大城市中烈属、军属人数最多的一个城市。过去的工作经验证明，在城区组织烈属、军属生产、介绍就业是解决烈属、军属生活问题的最好办法。北京市现已有被服、缝纫、装订、麻袋等三十七个烈属、军属的生产组织，烈属、军属参加生产的有一千四百九十二人。一九五一年获利（连工资在内）三十五亿四千四百三十四万六千五百元，超过了全年发放优待粮总数的百分之六十六。如每人每月生活费按六万元计算，可解决四千九百二十二人全年的生活问题。在介绍就业方面，截至一九五二年四月份止，介绍到政府机关、人民团体、工厂、学校工作的有五千一百三十人（包括临时工）。若以就业者每人平均养活两个半人（包括就业者本人在内）计算，可解决一万二千八百二十五人的生活问题。此外，各区组织军属参加会计、缝纫及其他技术学习的共一千二百零六人。这为军属打下了就业的基础。
    对郊区缺乏劳力的烈属、军属及革命残废军人都实行了固定代耕制；对孤、老无劳动力的采取了包耕制。基本上克服了临时派工的缺点，并作到了耕种及时，因而使烈属、军属的土地产量一般不低于一般农民土地的产量。
    三、在发放优待粮方面，北京市采取了重点使用的办法，并且证明了这种办法是行之有效的。根据烈属、军属的生活情况，经烈属、军属代表、小组长等评议，确定享受优待户数和粮食数量，按季或按月发放。全市享受实物优待的有八千七百六十三户、两万三千一百八十一人，占全市烈属、军属总人数的百分之二十三。由于组织生产和介绍就业的结果，享受优待户较一九五零年底降低了百分之十一。去年全年发放优待粮共折款二十一亿三千二百四十六万一千二百元，基本上解决了全市烈属、军属的生活问题。
    北京市一年来的优抚工作是有很大成绩的。但是，也还是有缺点的。如对个别年老或缺少文化的军属的就业问题，还没有能够很好地解决；实物优待也没有完全作到重点使用，以发挥其更大的效用。这些缺点都需要尽速纠正，以便将优抚工作在现有的基础上提高一步。
