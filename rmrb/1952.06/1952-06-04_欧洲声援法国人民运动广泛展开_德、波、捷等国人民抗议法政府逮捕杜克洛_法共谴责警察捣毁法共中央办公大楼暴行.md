Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: The movement in support of the French people, who are bravely defending peace and resisting fascist suppression, is unfolding vigorously in Europe.

The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Groot, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste, Vidali, have successively sent telegrams to the French Communist Party to express their support for the struggle of the French people. The telegram from the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party stated: The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and all true peace fighters in Germany resolutely protest the French government's arrest of Comrade Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, on the orders of the germ warfare general Ridgway. "We support your and all peace-loving French people's strong struggle to defend peace and the independence of your country, and demand the release of Duclos!" The telegram from the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party stated: The working people of Bulgaria protest the illegal arrest of Duclos, the leader of the French working people, and fully support the French working people's resolute demand for the immediate release of Duclos and Stie, editor-in-chief of "L'Humanité." The General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, Groot, expressed his support to the French people on behalf of the Dutch working people in a telegram and protested to the French and American embassies in The Hague. He demanded the immediate release of Duclos. The General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste, Vidali, also paid tribute to the French people who are fighting against war and the "plague general" Ridgway on behalf of the Communists and all working people in the Free Territory of Trieste, and protested against the illegal arrest of Duclos by the French government.

In Czechoslovakia, meetings were held in many factories, mines, government offices, schools, agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural machinery stations across the country, and resolutions were passed protesting the French government's illegal arrest of Duclos, Stie, and other patriots. The Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia, the Women's Federation, the Anti-Fascist Fighters Alliance, and many other people's organizations also made the same demands.

In Poland, the chairmen of the parliamentary party groups of various parties in the National Assembly jointly telegraphed the Speaker of the French National Assembly, Herriot, protesting the French government's illegal act of openly arresting Duclos, chairman of the French Communist Party parliamentary group.

In Romania, the National Assembly, which is in session, passed a resolution protesting the fascist atrocities of the French government. The Central Committee of the Romanian General Trade Union, the Romanian branch of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and other organizations also sent telegrams to the French government to express their protest.

In Albania, working people across the country held meetings to express their support for French patriots. The Albanian Peace Committee, the Albanian General Trade Union, Albanian women's and youth organizations, and other people's organizations sent telegrams to the French government to protest.

In Italy, Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, telegraphed Duclos, representing all the working people and democrats of Italy, to express fraternal support to Duclos. The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor also telegraphed the General Secretaries of the French General Confederation of Labor, Frachon and Le Léap, to express support for the struggle of the French people. At the same time, Professor Fredda, director of the Italian "Criminal Law Magazine" and the famous legal worker Renier, published articles in "Unità," pointing out that the arrest and "indictment" of Duclos was illegal.

In Austria, many factories in Vienna held protest rallies. The factories of the Lower Austrian Petroleum Enterprise sounded their sirens for one minute to protest the fascist atrocities of the French authorities. The Austrian Youth Peace Fighters demonstration held in Linz in the American occupation zone on May 31 also unanimously passed a resolution demanding the release of Duclos and Stie.

The Danish branch of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers also telegraphed French President Auriol, demanding the immediate release of Duclos and Stie.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 3rd: The French Communist Party issued the following statement regarding the destruction of the French Communist Party Central Committee office building by the French police:

The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party protests the recent atrocities committed by the Pinay government against the French Communist Party and other democratic groups. On May 31, the police, under the pretext of carrying out inspections, broke into the Communist Party Central Committee office building, searched the offices extensively, and destroyed the offices and furniture. The Secretariat angrily exposes the government and its police's lawless behavior.

The police broke into the offices of the Communist Party Central Committee and the Seine Provincial Committee, including the offices of comrades enjoying parliamentary privileges, and destroyed these offices in the absence of staff, regardless of all legal guarantees.

In this situation, the government can obviously first place the forged documents in the archives, and then let the police take the archives away, and finally announce what documents were found in these archives.

Therefore, the Secretariat specifically requires the French working people to recognize that the so-called search results are purely fabricated by the police authorities, and their purpose is to hinder the development of joint actions against fascism and against war. The Secretariat calls on the working class and the people of the whole country to strengthen this joint action and never give up until victory to answer this conspiracy.

The purpose of the Pinay government is obviously to prevent the French Communist Party from carrying out legal activities; therefore, the Secretariat of the Party decided that before the office building of the Party Central Committee is repaired, it will temporarily move to the office of the Communist Party parliamentary group of the National Assembly to continue its work.

    【新华社三日讯】对英勇保卫和平、反抗法西斯镇压的法国人民的声援运动，正在欧洲如火如荼地展开。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会、保加利亚共产党中央委员会、荷兰共产党总书记格鲁特和的里雅斯特自由区共产党总书记维达里先后致电法国共产党，声援法国人民的斗争。德国统一社会党中央委员会的电报说：德国统一社会党中央委员会和德国一切真正的和平战士们坚决抗议法国政府奉细菌战将军李奇微的命令逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛同志。“我们声援你们和一切爱好和平的法国人民为保卫和平和你们祖国的独立而进行的坚强斗争，并且要求释放杜克洛！”保加利亚共产党中央委员会的电报说：保加利亚劳动人民抗议非法逮捕法国劳动人民的领袖杜克洛，并且全力声援法国劳动人民坚决要求立即释放杜克洛和“人道报”总编辑斯梯的斗争。荷兰共产党总书记格鲁特在电报中代表荷兰劳动人民向法国人民表示声援，并且向法、美两国驻海牙大使馆提出抗议。要求立即释放杜克洛。的里雅斯特自由区共产党总书记维达里也代表的里雅斯特自由区的共产党员和全体劳动人民，向正在进行斗争反对战争和“瘟疫将军”李奇微的法国人民致敬，并且抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，全国许多工厂、矿场、机关、学校、农业合作社和农业机器站都举行了集会，通过了决议，抗议法国政府非法逮捕杜克洛、斯梯及其他爱国者。捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会、妇女联合会、反法西斯战士联盟及其他许多人民团体也提出了同样的要求。
    在波兰，国民议会各政党议会党团主席联名打电报给法国国民议会议长赫里欧，抗议法国政府公然逮捕法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛的非法行为。
    在罗马尼亚，正在开会的国民议会通过了决议，抗议法国政府的法西斯暴行。罗马尼亚总工会中央委员会、国际民主法律工作者协会罗马尼亚分会及其他组织，也都打电报给法国政府表示抗议。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，全国各地劳动人民纷纷集会，声援法国爱国者。阿尔巴尼亚和平委员会、阿尔巴尼亚总工会、阿尔巴尼亚妇女和青年的组织以及其他人民团体，都打电报向法国政府提出抗议。
    在意大利，意大利总工会总书记维多里奥打电报给杜克洛，代表意大利全体劳动人民和民主分子，向杜克洛表示兄弟的声援。意大利总工会书记处也打电报给法国总工会总书记佛拉商和勒里普，声援法国人民的斗争。同时，意大利“刑法杂志社”社长弗烈德教授和著名的法律工作者列尼尔在“团结报”发表文章，指出逮捕和“控告”杜克洛是非法的。
    在奥地利，维也纳的许多工厂都举行了抗议大会。下奥地利石油企业各工厂都鸣笛一分钟，表示抗议法国当局的法西斯暴行。五月三十一日在美国占领区林嗣地方举行的奥地利青年和平战士示威大会也一致通过决议，要求释放杜克洛和斯梯。
    国际民主法律工作者协会丹麦分会也打电报给法国总统阿里奥尔，要求立则释放杜克洛和斯梯。 【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎三日讯：法国共产党就法国警察捣毁法国共产党中央委员会办公大楼事发表声明如下：
    法国共产党中央委员会书记处抗议比内政府最近对法国共产党和其他民主团体所行使的暴行。五月三十一日，警察以进行检查为藉口，闯进共产党中央委员会办公大楼，在各办公室内大事搜查，捣毁办公室和家俱。书记处忿怒地揭露政府及其警察这种目无法纪的行为。
    警察闯入共产党中央委员会和塞纳省委员会的办公室，包括享受议员特权的同志们的办公室在内，不顾一切法律保障，在工作人员不在场的情况下，捣毁了这些办公室。
    在这种情况下，政府显然能够先把伪造好的文件安置在档案中，然后再让警察把档案拿走，最后就宣布在这些档案中发见了什么文件。
    因此，书记处特预先要求法国劳动人民要认清所谓搜查的结果纯粹是警察当局的捏造，其目的在妨碍反对法西斯主义和反对战争的联合行动发展。书记处号召工人阶级和全国人民加强这种联合行动，不到胜利决不罢休，这样来回答这种阴谋。
    比内政府的目的显然是要阻止法国共产党进行合法活动；因此，本党书记处决定：在本党中央委员会办公大楼修复之前，暂迁至国民议会共产党议员团办公处继续办公。
