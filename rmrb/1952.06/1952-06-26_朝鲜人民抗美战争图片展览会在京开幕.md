Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The "Korean People's Anti-American War Picture Exhibition," organized by the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War, opened at the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park, Beijing, on the morning of the 25th. The opening ceremony was personally presided over by Kwon O-jik, the Korean Ambassador to China.

Those attending the ceremony included Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, as well as Zhang Xiruo, Li Dequan, Zhang Hanfu, Ding Xilin, Yu Xinqing, Tang Yongtong, Chen Yuan, Ai Qing, Hong Shen, and more than one hundred others.

The ambassadors to China from the Soviet Union, Romania, Mongolia, Hungary, Vietnam, and Czechoslovakia, as well as the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic in China and the Chargé d'affaires of the Bulgarian and Polish Embassies in China, were also invited to attend.

Korean Ambassador to China Kwon O-jik delivered the opening speech. He first paid tribute to the Chinese people, who sent their outstanding sons and daughters to Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, and to Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people. He said: The American imperialists, in order to turn Korea into their colony and use it as a base for attacking China and the Soviet Union, launched a war of aggression against Korea. For two years, the entire Korean people have united around their beloved leader, General Kim Il-sung, and have persevered in a solemn and arduous struggle for the victory of the motherland, displaying a noble spirit of patriotism and internationalism. The American imperialists have suffered heavy blows in the past two years. Therefore, they have become even more frantic. They have abandoned all human morality, justice, and conscience, violated all international agreements, used bacteriological weapons on a large scale, barbarously murdered our captured personnel, and continued to indiscriminately bomb peaceful residents, attempting to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations. However, the facts of the past two years have proved how powerful the united strength of peace-loving people around the world is, and have also proved that the moribund Anglo-American imperialist aggressor group will inevitably fail. He pointed out: The content of the exhibition shows the victorious and heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people, exposes the crimes of aggression of American imperialism, and demonstrates that the struggle of the Korean people to liberate their motherland and defend world peace will surely be victorious.

Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen then delivered a speech. He said: The Korean People's Anti-American War Picture Exhibition will play a great role in exposing the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the American aggressors and in strengthening the confidence of the Chinese and Korean people in defeating the aggressors and defending peace. The past two years have been a time when the heroic Korean people have moved from victory to victory in resisting American aggression, a time when the brotherly friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people have continued to grow and be consolidated in battle, and a time when the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has thwarted the war-mongers' dreams of aggression. All of this has been proven by the great reality of the past two years, and this exhibition will more concretely demonstrate such a great and rich content. He said: American imperialists are the most shameless and despicable aggressors in human history, the destroyers of human civilization, and the most ferocious enemies of world peace. When it cannot achieve its aggressive goals by slaughter and violence, and cannot achieve this goal at the negotiating table, it violates human conscience and international conventions, conducts bacteriological warfare, and tortures Chinese and Korean prisoners of war in every possible way to delay negotiations. However, these barbarous and shameless atrocities of the aggressors cannot shake the Chinese and Korean people's confidence in victory. On the contrary, they further expose the original evil form of the aggressors, exposing that it has come to the end of its road and is making a dying struggle like a trapped beast, making it more isolated. He pointed out: The struggle of the Korean and Chinese people is also the struggle for peace for all peace-loving people in the world. No matter how barbaric and cruel the American aggressors are, victory will surely be ours, and failure will surely be theirs. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, we will surely be able to defeat the aggressors.

After the speech, Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen cut the ribbon. Ambassador Kwon O-jik then accompanied the guests into the exhibition hall for a tour.

The exhibition contains a total of 170 photographs and 19 Korean posters, displayed in nine sections, respectively explaining the conspiracy of the American and Li cliques to launch the war of aggression against Korea, the Korean People's Army bravely striking out to defend the motherland, the atrocities of the American and Li cliques, the Korean and Chinese People's troops fighting side by side, the Korean guerrillas active behind enemy lines, the Korean people in the rear supporting the front lines, American imperialism sabotaging the armistice negotiations and massacring prisoners of war, the United States conducting bacteriological warfare, and the situation of people all over the world supporting the Korean people. The exhibition will be open from the 26th, with the exhibition period scheduled for one month.

    朝鲜人民抗美战争图片展览会在京开幕
    【新华社二十五日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使馆为纪念朝鲜人民解放战争二周年而举办的“朝鲜人民抗美战争图片展览会”，于二十五日上午在北京中山公园水榭举行开幕典礼。开幕礼由朝鲜驻华大使权五稷亲自主持。
    参加典礼者有：中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会副主席彭真、陈叔通以及张奚若、李德全、章汉夫、丁西林、余心清、汤用彤、陈垣、艾青、洪深等一百多人。
    苏联、罗马尼亚、蒙古、匈牙利、越南、捷克斯洛伐克等国的驻华大使，德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团和保加利亚、波兰驻华大使馆的临时代办也应邀参加。
    朝鲜驻华大使权五稷致开幕词。他首先向派遣自己优秀的儿女到朝鲜和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民及中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席致敬。他说：美帝国主义为了想把朝鲜变为它的殖民地，并想把它作为进攻中国和苏联的基地，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。两年来，全朝鲜人民团结在自己敬爱的领袖金日成将军的周围，为了祖国的胜利，坚持进行了庄严而艰苦的斗争，发挥了高尚的爱国主义和国际主义精神。美帝国主义者两年来遭受到沉重的打击。因此，它更加疯狂了。它背弃了人类的一切道德、正义和良心，违反一切国际协定，大量使用着细菌武器，野蛮地屠杀我方的被俘人员，继续滥炸和平居民，企图拖延和破坏停战谈判。但是，两年来的事实证明了全世界爱好和平人民的团结力量是何等强大，也证明了日暮途穷的美英帝国主义侵略集团必将失败。他指出：展览会的内容显示出朝中人民的胜利的英勇斗争，揭露了美帝国主义的侵略罪行，说明朝鲜人民争取祖国解放、保卫世界和平的斗争一定会获得胜利。
    彭真副主席接着致词。他说：朝鲜人民抗美战争图片展览，对于揭穿美国侵略者外强中干的本质和加强中朝两国人民战胜侵略者和保卫和平的信心，有很大的作用。两年来的日子，是英雄的朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略由胜利走向胜利的日子，是中朝两国人民兄弟般的友谊团结在战斗中继续成长巩固的日子，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营挫败战争贩子侵略迷梦的日子。所有这些，已经为两年来的伟大现实所证明，这个展览会更将具体地表现出这样一个伟大而丰富的内容。他说：美帝国主义者是人类历史上最无耻的、最卑鄙的侵略者，是人类文明的破坏者，是世界和平最凶恶的敌人。当它既不能用屠杀、用暴力达到它的侵略目的，而在谈判桌上也不能达到这个目的时，它竟违背人类良知和国际公约，进行细菌战，并且虐杀中朝被俘人员，千方百计地拖延谈判。但是，侵略者这些野蛮无耻的兽行，不仅不能动摇中朝人民的胜利信心，相反地，是更加暴露了侵略者的罪恶原形，暴露它已经穷途末路在作困兽般的垂死挣扎，使它更加陷于孤立的困境。他指出：朝中人民的斗争也是为全世界爱好和平的人民的斗争，为和平的斗争。不管美国侵略者如何野蛮残暴，胜利的一定是我们，失败的一定是他们。在全世界爱好和平的人民的支援下，我们一定能战胜侵略者。
    词毕，由彭真副主席剪彩。权五稷大使随即陪同来宾进入展览室参观。
    展览会中共有图片一百七十帧及朝鲜招贴画十九幅，分作九个部分陈列，分别说明美、李匪帮阴谋发动侵朝战争、朝鲜人民军为保卫祖国奋勇出击、美李匪帮暴行、朝中人民部队并肩作战、在敌后活跃的朝鲜游击队、朝鲜后方人民支援前线、美帝国主义破坏停战谈判屠杀战俘、美国进行细菌战、全世界人民支援朝鲜人民的情形。展览会自二十六日起开放，展期预定一个月。
