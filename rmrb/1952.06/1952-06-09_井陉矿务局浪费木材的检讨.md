    Jingxing Mining Bureau's Self-Criticism on Wasting Timber

    To the Editor:
        The letter from reader Wen Tingbi, published in the People's Daily on March 20th, criticized our bureau for wasting timber. This criticism is correct.

        In 1951, the timber used by our bureau was entirely supplied by the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Timber Supply General Station. Because the supplied timber did not meet the specifications, our bureau repeatedly raised objections to the Supply General Station and the Coal Mine Management General Bureau, and raised this issue at the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Equipment Conference; however, due to the difficulty of logging, this issue has not been thoroughly resolved to date. The reader pointed out that our long-term open-air storage of substandard timber, allowing it to be eroded by wind and rain, fully demonstrates that our leadership does not sufficiently value state property. We will expedite measures to deal with this matter.
                                                        Jingxing Mining Bureau

### 井陉矿务局浪费木材的检讨

    井陉矿务局浪费木材的检讨
    编辑同志：三月二十日人民日报刊载了读者温廷壁的来信，对我局浪费木材的现象提出批评，这一批评是正确的。
    一九五一年我局所用的木材，完全由中央燃料工业部木材供应总站统一供应。因为供应的木材不合规格，我局曾多次向供应总站及煤矿管理总局提出意见，并在中央燃料工业部器材会议上提出这个问题；但因采伐困难，这个问题迄今没有得到彻底的解决。读者指出：我们把不合规格的木材长期露天放置，任凭风雨剥蚀，这充分说明，我们领导方面对国家财产是不够重视的。我们将尽速设法处理这件事情。
                                         井陉矿务局
