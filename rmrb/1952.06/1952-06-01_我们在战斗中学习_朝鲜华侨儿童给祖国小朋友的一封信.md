    We Learn in Battle
    —A Letter from Korean Overseas Chinese Children to Children in the Motherland
    Dear children of the motherland:
    We are children of Chinese descent living in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Before the liberation of Korea, most of us couldn't afford to go to school. After liberation, with the help of the Korean People's Government, overseas Chinese schools were established in various places. Here in a remote village in North Pyongan Province, where there are only thirty or so overseas Chinese children, a school was also established. From then on, we started to study. Unexpectedly, after only a few years of happy life, American imperialism launched a war of aggression. Many of our parents were bombed to death, our houses and clothes were burned, and even our beloved school and books were bombed by the American bandits.

    Dear children: But we were not intimidated by the American bandits. Although American planes come to bomb several times a day, we are not afraid at all now, because we are protected by the uncles of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Although we are in very small classrooms, sometimes even in air-raid shelters or in the fields, we do not feel distressed or tired at all. We have set up observation posts, and students take turns to monitor enemy planes, so that everyone can study with peace of mind. We not only study hard, but also reclaim wasteland and grow vegetables in our spare time to subsidize the lives of poor students.

    The volunteer uncles care about us very much and often come to visit us, telling us stories about fighting the American devils. They also gave us a large number of books and stationery that the people of the motherland had sent to comfort them.

    We are very united and friendly with the Korean children here. We have parties and play hide-and-seek with them. We and they hate American imperialism. We will study harder, support the Korean People's Government, and support the uncles of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to eliminate the American aggressors and the Li Chengwan puppet army as soon as possible, and live a happy study life like you.

    Finally, we hope you will write to us about the construction of our motherland and your studies.

    Wish you study hard!

    Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

### 我们在战斗中学习——朝鲜华侨儿童给祖国小朋友的一封信

    我们在战斗中学习
    ——朝鲜华侨儿童给祖国小朋友的一封信亲爱的祖国小朋友们：
    我们是侨居在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的儿童。朝鲜解放以前，我们大多数上不起学。解放后，在朝鲜人民政府的帮助下，各地都成立了华侨学校。我们这里——平安北道一个偏僻的村镇——华侨儿童不过三十人，也成立了一所学校。从那时起，我们就开始读书了。没想到刚过了几年快乐的生活，美帝国主义就发动了侵略战争。我们许多人的父母被炸死了，我们的房子、衣服被烧光了，连我们最心爱的学校和书籍，也被美国强盗炸毁了。
    亲爱的小朋友们：可是我们没有叫美国强盗吓倒。虽然美国飞机一天来轰炸几次，现在我们一点也不害怕，因为有中国人民志愿军叔叔和朝鲜人民军叔叔保护我们。我们虽然在很小的教室里，有时还在防空壕里或野地里去上课，可是一点也不感到苦恼和疲劳。我们设立了了望哨，同学们轮流去监视敌机，使大家能安心上课。我们不光努力学习，还在课余开荒种菜，补助贫苦同学的生活。
    志愿军叔叔很关心我们，时常到我们这里来访问，给我们讲打美国鬼子的故事。他们还把祖国人民慰劳他们的大批书籍和文具，送给了我们。
    我们和这里的朝鲜小朋友们非常团结友爱。我们和他们在一起联欢，捉迷藏。我们和他们都恨透了美帝国主义。我们要更加努力地学习，拥护朝鲜人民政府，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军叔叔们，早日消灭美国侵略军和李承晚傀儡军，和你们一样地过快乐的学习生活。
    最后，希望你们把咱们祖国的建设的情形和你们的学习情形写信告诉我们。
    祝你们努力学习！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
