Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 26th: More than 1,000 returned Overseas Chinese from Malaya, recently unreasonably deported by the British colonial authorities, and representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou, held a rally on the 24th to denounce the atrocities of British imperialism in persecuting Overseas Chinese in Malaya. At the meeting, many Overseas Chinese who had personally suffered persecution made angry accusations. Xu Cheng, a carpenter whose leg was broken by British military police, supported himself with a wooden leg and was the first to take the stage to accuse: "I was a carpenter working in a plank factory in Fengsheng Port, Johor. On July 18, 1948, the British imperialists suddenly dispatched six trucks of British police to surround the factory and fired wildly into it. I was shot and fell unconscious on the spot. When I woke up, I found I had been arrested. My right leg was broken and my left leg was hit by three bullets. After being brutally interrogated by the British police, I was imprisoned in a concentration camp. On the night of my arrest, British imperialist planes indiscriminately bombed the village where I lived. Nine of my family of eleven were killed. Even two grandchildren who were not sensible were killed. The remaining daughter was forced to wander to Sumatra. British imperialism has ruined my family. I must have revenge! I want to accuse the people of the whole country, and I ask the people of the whole country to avenge me!" Xu Cheng's tearful accusations aroused great anger among all those present, and the audience unanimously shouted: "Avenge the persecuted compatriots!" Then, Shi Kesheng, a rubber tapper from Jidalipu, Dingajalu, took the stage to accuse. Shi Kesheng had been working in Malaya for fifteen years. On January 19, 1949, the barbaric British military police suddenly surrounded his home and fired wildly. He was shot in the left leg and fell to the ground. The British police arrested him, put him in a rice bag, tied the mouth of the bag tightly, and carried him back to the police station. There, he was beaten to death by the British police. The next day, the British police sent him to a hospital, but not really to treat him, but to inflict more torture on him. Shi Kesheng said: "Compatriots: listen to how barbarously they ‘treated’ me! They used an iron bar to pierce through my wound, hanging sandbags on both ends, and I immediately fainted with pain! Later, they sent me to a mental hospital, tied me up, and let the lunatics beat me and dig my wound with their fingers, causing my whole body to bleed. Now my body is covered with scars." Shi Kesheng finally angrily said: "Today, I have returned to the people's motherland, and I want to expose the British imperialists' insane persecution of Overseas Chinese in Malaya to the people of the whole country!" Miner Ye Xing, vegetable farmer Liu Zhenrong, and editor-in-chief of the Nanyang Chinese Daily, Hu Weifu, successively took the stage to accuse their experiences of persecution. Ye Xing's left leg had been crippled by the British police and he had been detained in a concentration camp for nearly four years. When Ye Xing showed his left leg and his scarred body to the compatriots present, the audience erupted in an angry roar of "Resolutely protest against the British imperialists' atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese in Malaya."
    Finally, He Youdi, acting director of the Guangzhou Office of the Repatriated Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, was invited to speak. He said: The people of the whole country will never forget the cruel persecution of Overseas Chinese in Malaya by British imperialism. He called on the compatriots forced to return to the country to work hard to participate in the construction of the great motherland, strengthen the strength of the motherland, and resolutely support the more than two million Overseas Chinese still residing in Malaya in their just struggle to defend their legitimate rights and oppose persecution!

    被迫返广州的马来亚华侨集会
    控诉英帝国主义暴行
    【新华社广州二十六日电】最近被马来亚英国殖民当局无理驱逐出境返抵广州的华侨和广州市各界人民代表一千多人，在二十四日举行控诉英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨暴行大会。会上，许多曾身受迫害的华侨纷纷提出愤怒的控诉。被英国军警用枪打断了一条腿的木工许成撑着木脚首先上台控诉说：“我是在柔佛州丰盛港一家木板厂工作的木工，一九四八年七月十八日，英帝国主义者突然出动六卡车英警把工厂包围，并向厂内疯狂地开枪射击。我当场中弹昏倒，醒来时发现已被逮捕，右脚被打断了，左脚也中了三枪。我受到英警的酷刑讯问后，被关进了集中营。在我被捕的当晚，英帝国主义的飞机又滥炸了我所住的村庄。我一家十一口被炸死了九个。连两个还不懂事的孙儿也被炸死了，剩下一个女儿被迫流浪到苏门答腊。英帝国主义害得我家破人亡，我一定要报仇！我要向全国同胞控诉，我要求全国同胞替我报仇！”许成的血泪控诉，激起了全体到会者的极大愤怒，全场一致高呼：“为受迫害的同胞报仇！”接着，丁加奴吉打里埠的橡胶园割胶工人史克胜登台控诉。史克胜在马来亚做工已有十五年。一九四九年一月十九日，野蛮的英国军警突然包围了他的家，并疯狂地开枪扫射。他的左腿中弹，跌倒在地下。英警把他逮捕后，将他装进一个米袋里，紧扎住袋口，扛回警察局去。在那里，他又被英警打得死去活来。第二天，英警把他送进医院，但并不是真的替他治疗，而是对他施行更多的折磨。史克胜说：“同胞们：你们听听他们多么野蛮地给我‘治疗’啊！他们用一根铁条从我的伤口穿过去，两头都挂上砂包，我立刻痛得昏倒了！后来他们又把我送到一个疯人院，把我缚住，让那些疯人围殴和用手指挖我的伤口，弄得我全身鲜血直流。现在我的身上到处都是伤痕。”史克胜最后愤怒地说：“今天，我已回到了人民祖国，我要向全国同胞揭露英帝国主义这种疯狂迫害马来亚华侨的暴行！”矿工叶兴、种菜工人刘振荣、南侨日报总编辑胡伟夫等相继登台控诉受害的经过。叶兴的左腿已被英警打成残废，并被拘禁在集中营中近四年之久。当叶兴将他的左腿和满身伤痕展示给到会的同胞看时，全场响起一片“坚决抗议英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨的兽行”的愤怒吼声。
    大会最后邀请归国难侨处理委员会广州办事处代主任何友逖讲话。他说：我们全国同胞都永不会忘记英帝国主义对马来亚华侨的残酷迫害。他号召被迫回国的侨胞努力参加伟大祖国的建设工作，增强祖国力量，坚决支持现尚居留在马来亚的两百多万华侨为保卫正当权益和反对迫害而进行的正义斗争！
