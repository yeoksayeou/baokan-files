    Civil Affairs Section of the Neiqiu County People's Government, Hebei Province
    Reimbursed Zhao Shuangde's Medical Expenses for Injury Treatment
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" page on June 1st published Comrade Fan Jingxing's letter, criticizing the Neiqiu County Civil Affairs Section for neglecting the festering wound of revolutionary disabled soldier. Based on this letter, we conducted a review of our preferential treatment work. Through this review, we discovered many shortcomings in our preferential treatment work, such as not resolving some issues for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers, promptly enough, and sometimes not explaining patiently enough the specific demands of individual families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, or revolutionary disabled soldiers, that could not be met at present, leading to dissatisfaction with the preferential treatment work among some families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers. These are issues that we should immediately correct and pay constant attention to.
    The circumstances regarding the matter of revolutionary disabled soldier Comrade Zhao Shuangde are as follows: After Comrade Zhao Shuangde's wound recurred, he went to the county hospital for treatment on May 12th. Dr. Wang Jingchen of the hospital asked Comrade Zhao Shuangde to get a letter of introduction from the Civil Affairs Section. At that time, our county was conducting the "Three-Anti" campaign, and only one person in the section was maintaining operations. When Comrade Zhao Shuangde arrived, Comrade Zhao Demin of our section who was maintaining operations was working in the countryside, and some comrades from other agencies were inside doing accounting. These comrades did not try to help Comrade Zhao Shuangde solve this problem, and Comrade Zhao Shuangde had to return to the hospital and pay for the treatment himself. After the treatment, Dr. Wang Jingchen told him to go back the next day for a dressing change. But later, Comrade Zhao Shuangde had his dressing changed at the local garrison hospital and did not go back to the county hospital. On May 24th, when Comrade Zhao Shuangde went to the Civil Affairs Section for the second time, the wound had basically healed. After Comrade Zhao Demin learned about the above situation, he reimbursed Comrade Zhao Shuangde for the 7,000 yuan in medical expenses he had paid.

### 河北内邱县人民政府民政科  已偿付赵双德治伤的医药费

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河北内邱县人民政府民政科
    已偿付赵双德治伤的医药费
    编辑同志：六月一日“读者来信专页”刊载范景星同志的来信，批评内邱县民政科对革命残废军人伤口发作置之不理的错误。我们根据这件来信，对优抚工作进行了一次检查。经过检查，我们发现了优抚工作中的不少缺点，如对烈属军属及革命残废军人的某些问题解决不够及时，有时对个别烈属军属或革命残废军人的某些目前尚不能满足的要求，解释得也不够耐心，以致某些烈属军属及革命残废军人，对优抚工作不满意。这是我们应该立即纠正和经常注意的问题。
    关于革命残废军人赵双德同志的问题，经过的情形是这样：赵双德同志伤口复发后，五月十二日到县卫生院医治，该院王景辰医生就请赵双德同志到民政科开介绍信。当时我县正进行“三反”运动，科内只有一个人坚持工作。赵双德同志来时，本科坚持工作的赵德民同志正下乡工作，有几个别的机关的同志在里面算账。这些同志没有设法帮助赵双德同志解决这个问题，赵双德同志只得回卫生院，自己出钱治疗。治疗以后，王景辰医生告诉他第二天再去换药。但后来赵双德同志由当地驻军医院换了药，没再到卫生院去。五月二十四日，赵双德同志第二次到民政科时，伤口基本上已好了。赵德民同志知道上述情况后，就偿还了赵双德同志垫出的七千元医药费。
