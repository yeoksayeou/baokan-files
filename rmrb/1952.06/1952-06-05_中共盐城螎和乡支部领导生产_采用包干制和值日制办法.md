    CCP Yancheng Ronghe Township Branch Leads Production: Adopting a Contract System and a Duty System

    Editor: How township and village cadres who do not detach themselves from production can lead mass production without delaying their own production is a problem that we have not completely solved for several years. The Communist Party members of Ronghe Township, Qinnan District, Yancheng County, have implemented a "contract system" and a "shift duty system," which has basically solved this problem.

    Ronghe Township has a total of eighty-seven Party members, distributed in four villages. Eighty-four Party members lead mutual aid groups. The Party branch allocates the work of Party members according to their work ability and nature, following the principles of adapting to local conditions, clarifying division of labor, pairing with groups and households, and being responsible under contract. The branch divides Party members into groups by village and implements a "shift inspection duty system" for collective leadership. For example, in Xiji Village, there are three branch committee members and nine Party member cadres. Their division of labor is that two branch committee members are responsible for overall leadership, and the remaining ten people are divided into five shifts, with two people on duty each day, rotating every five days. The branch committee members lead Party members in each village to earnestly implement the duty system, and the responsibilities of the duty personnel are: key inspection, understanding the situation, and solving problems. The Party members on duty meet at the beginning and end of each day to introduce the situation and hand over responsibilities. All Party members in the village hold a meeting every five days to check and summarize, and formulate a work plan for the next five days.

    The implementation of this method has solved the contradiction between Party member cadres leading mass production and their own production, and their work enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been improved.

    This method is currently still being tested, and the experience is preliminary. I think it can be introduced for everyone to study. Wang Fu

    中共盐城螎和乡支部领导生产
    采用包干制和值日制办法
    编辑同志：不脱离生产的乡、村干部如何领导群众生产而又不耽误自己的生产，这是我们几年来都没有彻底解决的问题。盐城县秦南区螎和乡的共产党员实行了“包干制”和“分班值日制”，把这个问题基本上解决了。
    螎和乡共有八十七个党员，分布在四个村子里。有八十四个党员领导互助组。党支部按照党员的工作能力和工作性质，按照因地制宜、明确分工、顶组顶户、包干负责的原则，分配党员的工作。支部把党员以村为单位编成组，实行“分班检查值日制”，进行集体领导。如西季村有三个支部委员，九个党员干部，他们的分工就是两个支部委员负责全面领导，其余十个人分五班值日，每天两个人，五天轮换一次。支部委员分头在各村领导党员切实执行值日制，值日人员的责任是：重点检查，了解情况，解决问题。值日的党员每天上班和下班时接一下头，介绍情况，交代责任。全村党员每五天开会检查总结一次，并订出下五天的工作计划。
    实行这个办法，解决了党员干部领导群众生产和自己生产的矛盾，他们的工作积极性和生产积极性都提高了。
    这个办法目前还正在试行，经验也是初步的，我认为可以介绍出来，供大家研究。王甫
