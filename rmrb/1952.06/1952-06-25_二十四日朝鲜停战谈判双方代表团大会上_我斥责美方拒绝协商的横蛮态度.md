(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 24th) At the plenary session of the Korean armistice talks on the 24th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that the other side's actions inside and outside the meeting were completely contrary to their so-called willingness to negotiate and make peace. Disregarding our side's and the world's people's solemn opposition, the other side continued to illegally conduct "screening" of our captured personnel, attempting to legalize this thoroughly bankrupt "screening." General Nam Il sternly pointed out: Any trick to deceive the people of the world, and any whitewash by the other side's kept organs, cannot change the fact that the so-called "screening" is a complete violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention. The other side's continued illegal "screening" can only indicate their determination to detain prisoners of war and not to have a Korean armistice. General Nam Il also pointed out that the other side's assertion that the POW issue is a simple matter of returning the number of our personnel is fundamentally absurd. The issue of POW repatriation is fundamentally a matter of principle, and must be resolved on the reasonable basis of our May 2nd proposal, which enables both sides' POWs to return home and live peaceful lives, in accordance with the basic principles of the Geneva Convention. General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

    "You say you are willing to negotiate and willing to make peace, but your actions inside and outside the meeting are completely contrary to your statements. Disregarding our protests and the condemnation of world opinion, you continue to massacre our captured personnel. You are attempting to unilaterally and illegally dispose of 27,000 of our captured personnel. You are violating the 1949 Geneva Convention and the public promises of your POW camp commanders, and you continue to illegally conduct 'screening' of our captured personnel. At the meeting, you insist on a one-sided and unreasonable plan to detain prisoners of war, and refuse to conduct any negotiations. These unreasonable and provocative actions of yours are making it increasingly difficult to resolve the issue of POW repatriation, and are preventing the realization of an armistice in Korea. In fact, you are taking dangerous steps that could expand the Korean War. You say that the POW issue is a simple matter of returning the number of our personnel. This is an absurd statement, and our side cannot agree to it at all. The issue of POW repatriation is fundamentally a matter of principle, the principle of whether the belligerents will repatriate or detain the prisoners of war they hold after the armistice. Any claim to detain prisoners of war is a violation of the Geneva Convention, a violation of basic humanitarian principles, and absolutely cannot be tolerated. Our side resolutely opposes it. In order to negotiate a solution to the POW repatriation issue on a reasonable basis, our side has made many major efforts, and based on an agreement between both sides to guarantee that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War, we have put forward a concrete plan to enable both sides' prisoners of war to return home and live peaceful lives. Our May 2nd proposal fully complies with the Geneva Convention and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the POW repatriation issue. The POW repatriation issue must be resolved in accordance with the basic principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention. This is our firm and unwavering position. If your side is truly sincere in conducting negotiations to reach an armistice in Korea, you should immediately cease all unreasonable and provocative actions, abandon your arrogant attitude of refusing to negotiate, withdraw your illegal plan to detain prisoners of war, and honestly accept our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2nd as the basis for resolving the only remaining issue hindering the armistice."

    二十四日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我斥责美方拒绝协商的横蛮态度
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指责对方在会内外的行为和对方所谓愿意协商愿意停战的发言完全相反，对方不顾我方和全世界人民的严正反对，继续对我方被俘人员非法进行“甄别”，企图使这种早已彻底破产的所谓“甄别”合法化。南日将军严词指出：任何企图欺骗世界人民的诡计，和对方御用机构的粉饰，都不能改变所谓“甄别”是彻底违反一九四九年日内瓦公约的这一事实。对方继续非法进行“甄别”，只能表示对方决意扣留战俘，不要朝鲜停战。南日将军同时指出，对方所谓战俘问题是一个简单的遣返我方人数的问题，是根本荒谬的。战俘遣返问题根本上是一个原则问题，战俘遣返问题必须根据日内瓦公约的基本原则，在我方使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的五月二日方案的合理基础上求得解决。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “你们说你们愿意协商，愿意停战，但你们在会内外的行动和你们的发言完全相反。你方不顾我方的抗议和世界舆论的谴责，继续屠杀我方被俘人员。你方企图片面非法处理二万七千名我方被俘人员。你方违反一九四九年的日内瓦公约和你方战俘营长官的公开诺言，继续对我方被俘人员非法进行
    ‘甄别’。你方在会内坚持扣留战俘的片面无理方案，拒绝进行任何协商。你们的这些无理挑衅行为，使战俘遣返问题的解决日益困难，使朝鲜的停战不能实现。事实上你们正在采取着不惜扩大朝鲜战争的危险步骤。你们说战俘问题是一个简单的遣返我方人数的问题，这是一个荒谬的说法，我方完全不能同意。战俘遣返问题，根本上是一个原则问题，交战双方在停战后遣返或扣留其所收容的战俘的原则问题，而任何扣留战俘的主张都是违反日内瓦公约，违反起码的人道原则，绝对不能容许的，我方坚决反对。为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，我方作了多次重大努力，根据双方保证战俘不再参加朝鲜战争的协议，提出使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的具体方案。我方五月二日方案完全符合日内瓦公约，是解决战俘遣返问题唯一合理的基础。战俘遣返问题必须根据一九四九年日内瓦公约的基本原则求得解决，这是我方坚决不可动摇的立场。如果你方确有进行协商达成朝鲜停战的诚意，你们就应该立即停止一切无理挑衅行动，放弃拒绝协商的横蛮态度，撤消扣留战俘的非法方案，老老实实地接受我方五月二日的合理折衷方案为基础，解决目前阻碍着停战的唯一剩余问题。”
