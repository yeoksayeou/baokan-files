Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 23rd - "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 21st entitled "The Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army are Our True Friends," stating: The Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War has been conducted under the active support and vocal backing of the world's peace and democracy camp. Since U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, the movement of the people of various democratic countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, to aid the Korean people has expanded daily. All progressive humanity deeply sympathizes with and supports us. Especially during the most critical period of our Fatherland Liberation War, our neighbor, our true friend, the Chinese people, organized the Volunteer Army and sent it to the Korean battlefield to assist us.

Therefore, the Korean people understand more profoundly than ever the significance of uniting in difficult circumstances with peace-loving people throughout the world who possess a great spirit of internationalism.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who rose up in unison to resist the common enemy, have continuously shattered the enemy's aggressive attempts in heroic battles, dealing the enemy irreparable and fatal blows militarily and politically. The invincible strength and brilliant victories of the heroic Korean People's Army and the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting side by side have demonstrated to the people of the world the model of true internationalism and its formidable power.

The editorial pointed out: The reason why the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are able to display unparalleled heroism in every battle, defeating the aggressive armed forces of the U.S. and British imperialism, who are the most experienced in aggressive warfare and boast of being the strongest in the world, is because they are fighting for the freedom and independence of their own countries and for world peace, and therefore feel supremely honored and proud.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is composed of true patriots and their outstanding sons and daughters from among the Chinese people who have bravely resisted reactionary forces at home and abroad. Therefore, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for their own country and people at any time and in any place. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a force trained in patriotism and internationalism, and therefore it is full of the great spirit of respecting the sovereignty and independence of other nations and maintaining and strengthening peaceful and friendly relations with the people of neighboring countries, and it exerts a brave and resolute strong force in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of peace.

The editorial said: These are the factors that enable the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to win every battle and possess infinite power in their joint operations, and they are also the guarantee for them to move from victory to greater victory. Now these factors are becoming increasingly apparent.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have grown and strengthened in fierce battles into invincible armed forces with the latest technology and outstanding combat experience. They are standing even more firmly on the forefront of safeguarding Asian security and peace. If U.S. imperialism should undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and expand its war of aggression, then the Korean People's Army, together with its true friend, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, will surely give the aggressors a decisive blow.

    “民主朝鲜”报发表社论
    赞扬我志愿军对朝鲜人民的友谊援助
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】“民主朝鲜”报二十一日以“英雄的中国人民志愿军是我们真正的朋友”为题发表社论说：朝鲜人民的正义的祖国解放战争，一直是在全世界和平民主阵营的积极支持和声援之下进行的。自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，以伟大的苏联为首的各民主国家的人民援助朝鲜人民的运动即日益广泛地展开。全体进步人类都深切地同情和声援我们，特别是在我们祖国解放战争的最严重时期，我们的邻邦、真正的朋友——中国人民组织了志愿军，派到朝鲜战场来援助我们。
    因此，朝鲜人民比任何时期都深刻地体会了在艰苦的环境中与具有伟大的国际主义精神的全世界爱好和平的人民团结的意义。
    为了抗击共同的敌人而一致奋起的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在英雄的战斗中，连续粉碎了敌人的侵略企图，在军事上、政治上都给了敌人以无可挽救的致命打击。英雄的朝鲜人民军与光荣的中国人民志愿军并肩作战的无敌力量及其辉煌的胜利，在全世界人民面前显示了真正的国际主义的榜样和它的雄厚威力。
    社论指出：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军所以能够在每个战斗中发挥无比的英雄主义精神，战胜了世界上最富有侵略战争经验并自己吹嘘为最强大的美英帝国主义的侵略武装，是因为他们都是为自己祖国的自由、独立与世界和平而战，并因此而感到无上光荣与自豪。
    中国人民志愿军是由英勇反抗国内外反动势力的中国人民中的真正爱国者和他们的优秀儿女所组成的，因此他们随时随地都甘愿为自己祖国和人民献出自己的生命。中国人民志愿军是爱国主义与国际主义训练成的队伍，因此它充满了尊重其他民族的主权、独立和保持与加强对邻国人民的和平友好关系的伟大精神，在反对帝国主义与保卫和平的斗争中发挥了勇敢坚毅的强大力量。
    社论说：以上这些就是中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在并肩作战中百战百胜、力量无穷的因素，也是他们由胜利走向更大胜利的保障。现在这些因素是愈来愈显然了。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军已在激烈的战斗中成长壮大为具有最新的技术和卓越的战斗经验的无敌武装力量。他们正在更加坚强地屹立在保卫亚洲安全与和平的最前线。假如美帝国主义竟然破坏朝鲜停战谈判而扩大其侵略战争，那么，朝鲜人民军和自己的真正的朋友——中国人民志愿军一道，必将给侵略者以决定性的打击。
