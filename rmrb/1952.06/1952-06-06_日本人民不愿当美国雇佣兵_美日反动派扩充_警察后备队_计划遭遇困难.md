Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch from Tokyo: Despite the continuous urging from the American occupiers for Japan to accelerate its rearmament, even the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" had to admit on the 2nd that due to the opposition of the Japanese people and the poverty of Japan's finances and economy, the US-Japan reactionaries' plan to expand Japan's "Police Reserve Force" has encountered difficulties. According to the Yoshida government's plan, the first stage of expanding the new Japanese army disguised as the "Police Reserve Force" is to increase the 75,000-strong "Police Reserve Force" to 110,000 during this fiscal year, and to recruit the additional 35,000 personnel by this autumn. However, "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the Japanese people have had a "very bad reaction" to this expansion plan, believing that the "Police Reserve Force" are "mercenaries to be used as cannon fodder for American imperialism." Therefore, the Yoshida government's implementation of this plan is "not progressing as smoothly as expected." Although the deadline for new recruits to apply was extended by ten days, so far only 90,000 people have applied. And after physical examinations, only about 50,000 people are initially qualified to be new recruits. "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that it is expected that for reasons of "ideology and political inclination," the "Police Reserve Force" authorities will only select about 10,000 people from these 50,000. But the problem does not stop there; among the current 75,000 "Police Reserve Force" personnel, about 20,000 will be discharged this autumn because their two-year service term will be completed in October. In other words, if they are discharged as expected, "the authorities will simply not be able to achieve the plan to increase the personnel to 110,000."
    In order to complete its plan, the Yoshida government is plotting to force personnel whose terms of service have expired to continue serving and is conducting deceptive propaganda in an attempt to eliminate the people's hatred of the "Police Reserve Force." "Yomiuri Shimbun" revealed that the authorities are trying to minimize the number of people discharged this autumn and are planning to launch a propaganda campaign to realize their plan.
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" also revealed that despite this, the United States is not satisfied with the Yoshida government's military expansion plan. It demanded that the Yoshida government use "all means" to expand the "Police Reserve Force" to 180,000 this year. Faced with this demand from the United States, Yoshida showed hesitation in view of the many difficulties. On the one hand, he has ordered the "Police Reserve Force" authorities to study the American plan and to recruit 5,000 officer candidates, increasing the number of officers to 10,000, which is enough to command the 180,000 personnel required by the United States; on the other hand, he told US Ambassador to Japan Murphy at a meeting held on May 26: "It is currently impossible to further increase the personnel of the National Police Reserve Force."
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" quoted "people close to Yoshida" as revealing the reasons why Yoshida felt it was difficult to implement the American proposal. From these reasons, it can be seen that Yoshida's biggest concern is that if his government blatantly engages in large-scale rearmament, it will inevitably be met with more opposition and abandonment from the people, and the Japanese general election is about to be held in a few months, before which Yoshida needs to continue to wear the mask of "peace." Financial difficulties also prevent Yoshida from resolutely implementing the American proposal. "People close to Yoshida" said: The "Police Reserve Force" already spends about 800,000 yen per member each year, rather than the 500,000 yen estimated by the United States, and in the future the Yoshida government must double the "Police Reserve Force" budget because it must establish new training centers and facilities. Therefore, even if all 56 billion yen under the "security expenses" item in the Japanese budget is used to expand the "Police Reserve Force" according to the American opinion, it is completely insufficient to increase it to 180,000 people.

### 日本人民不愿当美国雇佣兵  美日反动派扩充“警察后备队”计划遭遇困难

    日本人民不愿当美国雇佣兵
    美日反动派扩充“警察后备队”计划遭遇困难
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：尽管美国占领者在不断地催促日本加速重新武装，但是，甚至日本资产阶级报纸“读卖新闻”在二日也不得不承认：由于日本人民的反对和日本财政经济的贫困，美、日反动派扩充日本“警察后备队”的计划遭遇到了困难。根据吉田政府的计划，扩充以“警察后备队”为外衣的日本新陆军的第一个阶段是：在本会计年度把七万五千名的“警察后备队”增加到十一万名，并在今年秋季以前募足这增加的三万五千名人员。但是，“读卖新闻”说，日本人民对于这个扩军计划产生了“很坏的反应”，他们认为“警察后备队”是“充当美帝国主义炮灰的雇佣兵”。因此，吉田政府在实行这个计划时，“进行得并不像预料那样顺利”。虽然新兵的报名期限延长了十天，但是，迄今为止，只有九万人报名。而经过体格检查之后，只有五万人左右初步有资格当新兵。“读卖新闻”说，预料为了“思想和政治倾向”的缘故，
    “警察后备队”当局将从这五万人中只挑选出一万人左右。而问题还不止此，在目前的七万五千名
    “警察后备队”人员中，约有两万人将在今年秋天退伍，因为他们的两年服役期到十月就满了。换句话说，假如他们像预料那样退伍的话，“当局就根本实现不了把人员增为十一万人的计划”。
    吉田政府为了完成它的计划，正阴谋强迫服役期满的人员继续服役，并进行欺骗宣传，借图消除人民对“警察后备队”的憎恶。“读卖新闻”透露，当局正设法尽量减少在今年秋天退伍的人数，并在设法发动一个宣传运动，以实现它的计划。
    “读卖新闻”并透露，尽管如此，美国对吉田政府的扩军计划，并未感到满足。它要求吉田政府用“一切办法”在本年度把“警察后备队”扩充为十八万人。对于美国这一要求，吉田鉴于困难重重，表现出犹豫的态度。一方面，他已命令“警察后备队”当局研究美国的计划，并使它征募了五千名候补军官，使军官人数增为一万人，足以指挥美国所要求的十八万人员；另一方面，他又在五月二十六日举行的一次会议上告美国驻日大使墨菲说：“目前不可能进一步增加国家警察后备队的人员”。
    “读卖新闻”引述了“接近吉田的人士”所透露的吉田所以感到难以执行美国的建议的原因。从这些原因中人们可以看出，吉田最大的顾虑是：他的政府如果露骨地从事大规模的重新武装，必将遭到人民更多的反对和唾弃，而日本的大选即将在数月之后举行，在这以前，吉田有必要继续戴着“和平”的假面具。财政上的困难也使吉田对美国的建议不能坚决执行。“接近吉田的人士”说：“警察后备队”每年已为每一队员花费八十万日元左右，而不是美国所估计的五十万日元，并且今后吉田政府必须把“警察后备队”的预算加倍，因为它必须建立新的训练中心和设施。因此，即使根据美国的意见把日本预算中“安全费用”项目下的五百六十亿日元全部用于扩充“警察后备队”，要增加到十八万人，也是完全不够用的。
