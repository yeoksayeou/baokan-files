    Punish American Criminals Who Destroy Peace Facilities
    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China

    The numerous crimes committed by American aggressors on Korean soil have long aroused the public indignation of all kind people in the world. After launching germ warfare, disrupting the armistice negotiations, and massacring our captured personnel, these American criminals ruthlessly bombed power plants on the Yalu River and other places, which have no military significance, on the 23rd and 24th! They have "blown to smithereens" the welfare facilities necessary to maintain the lives of millions of peaceful people in Korea! These criminals, vainly attempting to achieve the goals they could never achieve on the disastrous battlefield of the Korean War, have resorted to such heinous means of violating international law and creating even greater disasters, which are violations of humanity!

    For the sake of the happiness and health of the broad masses of the Korean people, the Red Cross Society of China voluntarily organized seven international medical and health service teams, with a total of 660 medical personnel, to go to Korea to assist the Korean people in their medical and health work to eliminate disasters. However, the American aggressors have repeatedly inflicted man-made disasters on the Korean people. We absolutely cannot tolerate this heinous act of completely opposing the peace and happiness of all mankind!

    The American aggressors' barbaric atrocities, which are utterly contrary to humanity, have aroused the irrepressible anger of all the staff of our New China Red Cross. We lodge a serious protest against this criminal act and call on Red Cross workers with humanitarian hearts and all peace-loving people in the world to face up to the criminal behavior of the American criminals, who must bear serious consequences. We will take practical actions to give the American criminals the punishment they deserve.

    制裁破坏和平设备的美国罪犯
    中国红十字会总会会长  李德全
    美国侵略者在朝鲜国土上所犯的累累罪行，早已激起了全世界善良人民的公愤。而这些美国的罪犯们竟又于发动细菌战、破坏停战谈判及大肆屠杀我被俘人员之后，残忍地在二十三、二十四两日，滥炸毫无军事性质的鸭绿江等处发电厂，将那些维系着朝鲜千百万和平人民生活所必需的福利设备“炸得稀烂”！这些罪犯们妄想达到它们在惨遭失败的侵朝战场上所绝不能达到的目的，竟采取了这样背弃国际公法、制造更大灾难的违反人道的罪恶手段！
    中国红十字会为了广大朝鲜人民的幸福与健康，曾志愿组织了共有六百六十个医护人员的七个国际医防服务大队，到朝鲜去致力于协助朝鲜人民消灭灾难的医疗救护工作。而美国侵略者却一次再一次的予朝鲜人民以人为的灾难，这种彻底敌视全人类和平与幸福的罪恶行为，是我们绝不能容忍的！
    美国侵略者彻底违反人道的野蛮暴行，激起了我们新中国红十字会全体工作人员不可遏制的愤怒，我们对这种罪恶行为提出严重的抗议，并呼吁全世界具有人道心肠的红十字工作者及全世界爱好和平的人民，正视美国的罪犯们这一必须担负严重后果的罪恶行为。我们将以实际行动，予美国罪犯们以应得的制裁。
