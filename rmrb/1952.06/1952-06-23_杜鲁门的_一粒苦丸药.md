Truman's "Bitter Pill"

In the current Korean negotiations, the American aggressors, regarding the POW issue, the only obstacle to progress, completely lack the courage to admit their crimes against the Geneva Convention and refuse to abandon their absurd claims of "voluntary repatriation" and "re-screening." However, they are now devoid of any reasonable arguments. In the face of this mountain of crimes and complete lack of justification, the US side is racking its brains, trying every despicable and rogue means to continue to delay and deny. The repeated shameful escapes of the US representatives from the Panmunjom negotiating table are well-known; however, people should also pay attention to another shameless tactic the US is employing, namely the conspiracy of Truman himself to instigate a so-called "neutral nation" investigation of the Geoje Island POW camp.

According to recent reports from American news agencies, Truman wrote to his Secretary of Defense Lovett on the 11th of this month, suggesting inviting India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Sweden, and Switzerland to send officers to Geoje Island to investigate the situation of the POWs. What is the purpose of this? Anyone can see that this is an attempt by the US to use these countries to whitewash its bloody crimes of cruelly slaughtering POWs. The American "San Francisco Chronicle" commented on the 16th of this month, admitting: "President Truman said that this proposal has many benefits" because "the report of this inspection team to the world will clear the United Nations forces of the crimes accused by the communists and expose the communist lies." The US's conspiratorial purpose is clearly revealed here.

However, facts have proven and will continue to prove that the US's attempt to whitewash its crimes is impossible. The US's heinous crimes of slaughtering POWs cannot be concealed. The crimes of the US in slaughtering POWs that are already known to people, though only a fraction of the actual situation, are already too numerous to count; moreover, all these crimes can be fully confirmed without any further investigation or inspection. This is not some "communist lie," but is confirmed by the US's own published materials. People will remember that the materials in which Dodd and Colson confessed to the US's torture and killing of our captured personnel were published in Clark's statement; materials of the US's large-scale slaughter of our captured personnel on Geoje Island on various occasions were all published by American news agencies such as the Associated Press and United Press International. Only the shameless American aggressors themselves would deny the facts they have confessed to and lie through their teeth.

Now Truman is still trying to use a "neutral nation's" "investigation" and "inspection" to "clear" the crimes, which is obviously wishful thinking. Because this kind of "investigation" and "inspection" has already been carried out. Even the "International Committee of the Red Cross," which has always been under the wing of the United States, could not completely cover up the bloody atrocities of the United States. Let us look at the report of this "International Committee of the Red Cross" on the Geoje Island massacre of February 18. The report stated: "From February 9th to 17th, representatives of the Red Cross were inspecting various POW camps on Geoje Island. Early in the morning of February 18th, they learned that a serious incident had occurred in the evening at the 62nd POW camp. The Red Cross representatives rushed to the scene as quickly as possible and realized that the POW camp authorities were conducting a designed re-screening with military support before dawn"; "Approximately a regiment of troops, armed, stormed into the barracks. Almost all the prisoners were detained in a tent under surveillance." "These detainees, under the threat of bayonets, did not know what was going to happen. Several who wanted to leave the tent were shot. After hearing this, the detainees believed that they were all going to be killed, so they went out to defend themselves and see what was happening. The troops then attacked them with weapons." This on-site inspection and investigation report could not but expose certain aspects of the US's so-called "re-screening," precisely because the US's crimes were massive and extremely serious, and therefore could not be completely concealed. However, the US has never dared to face up to even such inspection and investigation reports. Therefore, it is easy to see what Truman's intention is in organizing a "neutral nation" to "inspect" and "investigate" now.

American official commentators are desperately trying to comfort themselves, saying how "clever" Truman's proposal is; they are also putting on the stinking airs of the capitalist world's hegemon, thinking that they can still manipulate some countries at will. However, in today's world, the American aggressors' attempt to drive these countries to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the US is not entirely unopposed. No truly neutral country or organization would agree to or participate in the US government's obvious criminal activities. Now that the American aggressors' crimes of large-scale slaughter of POWs are known to the world, no truly neutral country or organization will willingly act as a tool of the American aggressors to wash away the bloodstains of their crimes. The American "Rochester Union and Advertiser" called Truman's so-called "neutral nation" "investigation" plan a "bitter pill" and believes that "this pill must be swallowed." We should say that Truman is peddling "a bitter pill," and whoever is deceived into "swallowing" it will be poisoned beyond redemption.

### 杜鲁门的“一粒苦丸药”

    杜鲁门的“一粒苦丸药”
    美国侵略者在目前朝鲜谈判中，对于唯一障碍目前谈判进展的战俘问题，完全没有勇气承认它违反日内瓦公约的罪行，不肯放弃它的所谓“自愿遣返”和“重新甄别”的荒谬主张，然而它又已经毫无道理可说了。在这罪案如山、理屈词穷的情况下，美方就挖空心思，想用尽一切卑鄙无赖的手段，继续拖延与抵赖。美方代表屡次不知羞耻地从板门店谈判桌子上一溜而逃，这是人们所共见共知的了；然而人们还应该注意到美方正在耍弄的另一个无耻的手段，这就是杜鲁门亲自策划的所谓“中立国”调查巨济岛战俘营的阴谋。
    据美国通讯社最近的消息透露：杜鲁门在本月十一日写信给他的国防部长罗维特，建议邀请印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、瑞典、瑞士五国，派遣军官到巨济岛调查战俘情况。这样做的目的是什么呢？人们一看就会知道，这是美国企图利用这些国家，去替美国洗刷它残酷地屠杀战俘的血腥罪迹。美国“旧金山纪事报”本月十六日的评论供认：“杜鲁门总统说，这个建议有许多好处”，因为“这个视察团对全世界的报告，将刷清共方加在联合国军身上的罪名，揭穿共方谎言”。美国的阴谋目的，从这里已经非常明显地暴露出来了。
    但是，事实已经证明并将继续证明，美国企图洗刷罪行是不可能的。美方屠杀战俘的滔天罪行，是绝对掩盖不住的。人们所已经知道的美方屠杀战俘的罪行，虽然还不及实际情况的万一，但也已经是罄竹难书的了；而且，这一切罪行，已经不必要再做什么调查和视察就完全可以确定的了。这也根本不是什么“共方谎言”，而是美国方面自己发表的材料所证实的。人们都会记得，杜德和柯尔生供认美方虐杀我方被俘人员的材料，是在克拉克的声明中发表的；美方历次在巨济岛上大规模屠杀我方被俘人员的材料，无一不是由美国的通讯社如美联社、合众社等所发表的。只有毫无羞耻的美国侵略者自己，才会在他们自己所供认的事实面前，百般抵赖，满口扯谎。
    现在杜鲁门还企图用什么“中立国”的“调查”和“视察”来“刷清”罪行，这显然是枉费心机的。因为这一类的“调查”和“视察”也早已进行过了。一向在美国卵翼之下的“红十字国际委员会”都不可能把美方的血腥暴行完全掩盖起来。我们就看一看这个“红十字国际委员会”关于巨济岛二月十八日大屠杀事件的报告吧。这个报告中说：“从二月九日至十七日，红十字会的代表正在巨济岛各战俘营视察。二月十八日一早获悉第六十二号战俘营在晚上发生了严重事件。红十字会的代表们尽其所能地赶快赶到现场，才明白战俘营当局在拂晓以前，以军队为支援进行其所设计的重行甄别”；“大约有一团人的部队，武装冲入营房。差不多所有被俘者在监视下被扣在一个帐幕里”。“这些被扣者在刺刀的威胁下，不知道要发生什么事情，有几个想离开帐幕的，便遭到了枪击。被扣者听见了这以后，认为他们要全体被杀，便走出去保卫他们自己，并看看到底发生什么事情，这些部队便用武器攻击他们。”这个现场的视察和调查报告，所以不能不暴露了美方所谓“重新甄别”的某些情况，就因为美方的罪行是大量的、极端严重的，因而是无法完全掩饰的。然而，就是对于这样的视察和调查报告，美方也一直不敢予以正视。因此，现在杜鲁门又要组织什么“中立国”去“视察”和“调查”，其用心何在也就可想而知了。
    美国的官方评论正极力安慰他们自己，说杜鲁门的这个建议如何“聪明”；他们还大摆其资本主义世界霸主的腐臭架子，以为他们还可以把某些国家随意玩弄于其股掌之间。但是，在今天的世界上，美国侵略者企图驱使这些国家来为美国火中取栗的做法，也不是完全能够不受阻难的。任何真正中立的国家或机构，都不会同意或参与美国政府明显的罪恶活动。当着美国侵略者大规模屠杀战俘的罪行已为举世所周知的今天，决不会有任何真正的中立国家或机构甘心去充当美国侵略者的工具，去洗刷美国侵略者罪行的血迹。美国“罗彻斯特联合时报”把杜鲁门的这个所谓“中立国”的“调查”计划叫做“一粒苦丸药”，并且认为“这粒丸药非吞下去不可”。我们应该说，杜鲁门是在出卖着“一粒苦丸药”，谁要是被骗而把它“吞下去”，谁就会中毒而不可救。
