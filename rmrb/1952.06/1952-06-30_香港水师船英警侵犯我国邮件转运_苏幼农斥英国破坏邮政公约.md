Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The Chinese steamship "Xinchang," sailing between Guangzhou and Shantou, was unreasonably inspected by Hong Kong naval vessel No. 3 at approximately 18:30 on March 30, 1952, after departing Dachanshan at 16:40 and sailing through the waters off Castle Peak. The British police officers on the naval vessel brazenly opened three of the Chinese domestic mailbags being transported by the "Xinchang" – one bag of printed matter No. 85 from Guangzhou to Shantou, one parcel No. 94 from Guangzhou to Chao'an, and one parcel No. 6 from Tianjin to Shantou. They tore off the bag tag and lead seal of the Tianjin to Shantou bag and threw them into the sea, and cut open two cans of seasoning powder inside a parcel with a knife.

The Hong Kong naval vessel British police officers' illegal opening of Chinese mailbags, tearing off of bag tags and seals, and cutting open of parcels constitute a clear violation of China's freedom of mail transit and a breach of the Universal Postal Convention, which the British government has signed and ratified. Su Younong, Director-General of the Chinese Postal Administration, has protested the aforementioned illegal actions of the Hong Kong naval vessel British police officers and has requested that the 13th Universal Postal Congress, currently being held in Brussels, Belgium, take the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such illegal incidents.

    香港水师船英警侵犯我国邮件转运
    苏幼农斥英国破坏邮政公约
    【新华社二十九日讯】我国行驶广州、汕头间的新昌轮船于一九五二年三月三十日十六时四十分驶离大铲，至十八时三十分左右，驶经青山地方海面，遇香港水师第三号水师船，横遭其无理检查；该水师船英警竟将新昌轮所载运之我国国内邮袋拆开三袋，计广州寄汕头第八五号印刷品一袋，广州寄潮安第九四号邮包一袋，天津寄汕头第六号邮包一袋；将天津寄汕头一袋的袋牌及铅质封志撕下，掷入海中，并将内装包裹一件所装之调味粉用刀割破两罐。
    香港水师船英警非法开拆我国邮袋、撕毁袋牌封志，并割破邮包，显系侵犯我国邮件转运自由，以及破坏业经英国政府签字并批准的万国邮政公约。我中华邮政总局局长苏幼农已就上述香港水师船英警的非法行为表示抗议，并请现正在比利时布鲁塞尔举行的第十三届万国邮政大会采取必要的措施，制止此类违法事件的再度发生。
