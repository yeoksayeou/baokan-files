Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: Over 70,000 Hui people in Beijing held prayers in 49 mosques on the 25th to celebrate the Islamic Eid al-Fitr and commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against US aggression.

    The famous Niujie Mosque and Dongsi Pailou Mosque held grand festival ceremonies. In the early morning, the temples were already crowded with Hui people dressed in festive costumes. After completing the religious ceremonies, they held meetings where they expressed their strong will to oppose wars of aggression, strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and defend human peace. The Ahong of the Dongsi Pailou Mosque spoke first, expressing his infinite gratitude for the People's Government's resolute implementation of the policy of religious freedom and national equality and unity. He called on Hui compatriots to redouble their efforts to participate in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, to defend our beloved motherland, and to defend world peace. Ma Jian, professor at Peking University and one of the heads of the Beijing Hui People's Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, said: We Hui people who believe in Islam love peace. To defend peace, we resolutely oppose aggression. Today, we want to accuse the US imperialists of their heinous crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China to peace-loving people all over the world. We support the just proposal made by Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik in the Security Council. In the Niujie Mosque, as soon as Ma Yuhuai, chairman of the Beijing Hui People's Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, finished speaking, Li Yongxiang, a Hui person, stood up and said: "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries did not treat us Hui people as human beings. We have lived in pain for many years; Chairman Mao came and led us from darkness to light, and we will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness." Finally, the entire audience unanimously passed a letter of respect to Chairman Mao, and at the same time sent a telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers saying: "We guarantee to you: to increase production and practice economy, step up the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, unite with compatriots of all ethnic groups, and strive for peace and for the construction of a great motherland."
    In order to facilitate the festival for Hui civil servants, soldiers, and teachers and students, all agencies, organizations, troops, and schools in Beijing were given a day off today. In the afternoon, the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission also invited Lian Pusheng, Ma Jian, Bai Shouyi, Ahong, and other famous Islamic figures in Beijing to celebrate the festival together. State-owned department stores, retail companies, Xinhua bookstores, and cooperatives all offered discounts for one day to give preferential treatment to the Hui people. The state-owned slaughterhouse slaughtered twenty head of cattle specifically to supply meat to the Hui people.

    【新华社二十五日讯】北京市七万多回族人民，二十五日分别在四十九座清真寺内举行礼拜，欢度伊斯兰教的开斋节，并纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年。
    著名的牛街清真寺和东四牌楼清真寺，举行了隆重的节日仪式。清晨，寺院里就已挤满了穿着节日盛服的回族人民，他们作罢宗教仪式之后，便举行会议，会上大家表示了反对侵略战争、加强抗美援朝和捍卫人类和平的坚强意志。东四牌楼清真寺阿訇首先讲话，他对人民政府坚决贯彻宗教信仰自由和民族平等团结的政策，表示无限的感奋。他号召回族同胞要加倍努力地参加抗美援朝运动，保卫可爱的祖国，保卫世界和平。北京回民抗美援朝会负责人之一、北京大学教授马坚说：我们信奉伊斯兰教的回族人民是爱好和平的，为了保卫和平，我们坚决反对侵略。今天，我们要向全世界爱好和平的人民控告美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的滔天罪行。我们拥护苏联驻联合国代表马立克在安全理事会上正义的建议。在牛街清真寺里，北京市回民抗美援朝会主席马玉槐刚讲完话，回民李永祥就站起来说：“过去国民党反动政府把我们回民不当人看，我们多少年来都在痛苦中过日月；毛主席来了，把我们从黑暗里领到光明，我们永远忘不了毛主席的恩德”。最后，全场一致通过写信给毛主席致敬，同时发电报给中国人民志愿军说：“我们向你们保证：作到增产节约，加紧抗美援朝，团结各民族同胞，为争取和平，为建设伟大的祖国而奋斗。”
    为了便于回族公务人员、战士和师生度节，北京各机关团体、部队和学校今天都放假一日。下午，中央民族事务委员会并邀请在京的伊斯兰教著名人士连蒲生、马坚、白寿彝及阿訇等多人在一块过节。国营百货公司、零售公司、新华书店及合作社，都减价一日，优待回族人民。公营屠宰场并为供应回族人民肉食，特宰牛二十头。
