Hebei Ninghe Sixth District Women, Over 1,700 Strong
Form Locust Egg Excavation Brigade to Ensure This Year's Agricultural Harvest

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are 1,750 women from 46 villages in the Sixth District of Ninghe County, Hebei, participating in the locust egg excavation campaign. Under the leadership of the People's Government, we have formed a women's brigade to excavate locust eggs in order to eliminate locust plagues and ensure a bountiful agricultural harvest this year.

In 1951, our district experienced a severe locust plague. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the masses actively caught and killed locusts, eliminating a total of 2.5 million jin of locusts. This year, the government proposed the locust control policy of "prevention is more important than treatment." From March 14th to May 1st, we excavated an area of 7,100 mu, excavating over 4,200 jin of locust eggs, which is equivalent to eliminating 211.74 million locusts.

Now we are working as usual, braving the spring rain. Recently, the reeds in the wasteland have grown two chi high, and we can't squat down, so we have to half-bend over to dig; at the same time, the egg holes are also difficult to find. But we still persevere, because when we think of our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—we are not afraid of anything and can overcome any difficulties. Sometimes people hurt their feet in the grassy puddles, they immediately bandage their feet and continue to work without even a groan. Our shoes are almost worn out every three or four days, and we take the time to make a pair to replace them. All of our women on the egg-digging front have made a pact, determined "never to withdraw until a complete victory is won," and are determined to fight the locust eggs to the end.

The Entire Team of the Women's Locust Egg Excavation Brigade of the Sixth District of Ninghe County

    河北宁河第六区妇女一千七百余人
    组成挖掘蝗卵大队保障今年农业丰收
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是河北宁河县第六区四十六个村参加挖蝗卵战斗的一千七百五十个妇女。我们在人民政府的领导下，组成一个妇女大队，挖掘蝗卵，以便消灭蝗灾，保障今年的农业丰收。
    一九五一年我们这区曾发生严重的蝗灾，在人民政府的领导下，群众积极捕打，共消灭蝗虫二百五十万斤。今年，政府提出了“防重于治”的灭蝗方针。我们从三月十四日开始到五月一日止，挖掘面积达七千一百亩，共已挖出蝗卵四千二百多斤，等于消灭蝗虫两万万一千七百四十万个。
    现在我们冒着春雨照常工作着。近来荒地的芦苇已有二尺高，我们蹲不下，只有半弯着腰去挖；同时卵孔也很难找了。但我们仍然坚持着干下去，因为我们一想到我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，我们便什么都不怕，什么困难都能克服了。有时人们在草洼里扎坏了脚，便马上把脚包扎起来继续工作，哼也不哼一声。我们的鞋子差不多三四天就扎破一双，我们就抽空赶做一双换上。我们全体妇女在挖卵战线上订出了公约，抱定“不获全胜决不收兵”的决心，坚决和蝗卵斗争到底。
