    Since the mobilization to launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy on May 7, more than a month has passed. In the past month or so, the movement has progressed rapidly, with the vast number of workers and staff acting enthusiastically, and most factories and mines have formulated their own plans to increase production and practice economy. According to preliminary statistics, the total value of the increase in production and economy plans of state-owned and public industries in the entire region has exceeded 10 million tons of grain, and this number will be exceeded after mass discussion. Cadres and the masses have a high degree of enthusiasm for increasing production and practicing economy, and are full of the victorious confidence of "only exceeding, not falling behind" in their plans, and are actively trying to find ways to find tricks. In Shenyang alone, 11,700 tricks have emerged since the start of the campaign (compared to only 4,500 in the three months after the start of the increase production and practice economy campaign last year). All this shows that this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, under many new favorable conditions, has developed more fully and vigorously than last year. However, the development of the movement is not balanced. By system, units under the Industrial Department are better, while other departments, bureaus, and local industries are worse. By region, the Shenyang area is better, while Anshan, Dalian, and other places are worse. Some regions and units will not be able to discuss and finalize their plans until the end of June. In the discussion of the plans, many factories and mines have not specifically discussed the issue of improving quality, nor have they specifically discussed the issue of safety and welfare. There are also some ideological and organizational problems in the increase production and practice economy and the promotion of advanced experience.
    In order to make the increase production and practice economy campaign more deeply and fully carried out, and to further push the movement to a climax, the following issues must be focused on:
    (1) Ensure the quality of products and projects, and comprehensively complete the national plan and the increase production and practice economy plan
    Every comrade must clearly understand that the specific requirements for completing the national plan and overfulfilling the plan for increasing production and practicing economy are: ① not only should the plan be completed and exceeded on average by each industrial sector, but also each enterprise, workshop, group, and machine tool should overfulfill the plan; ② not only should the plan be completed and exceeded according to the total value of production, but also each product (especially the main products) should overfulfill the plan; ③ not only should the plan be completed and exceeded according to quantity indicators, but also the quality and cost indicators should be overfulfilled; ④ not only should the plan be completed and exceeded on an annual and quarterly basis, but also the plan should be overfulfilled on a monthly, weekly, and even daily basis.
    When discussing the national plan and formulating the increase production and practice economy plan, many advanced factories and mines have fully discussed the plan according to the above requirements, paid attention to completing various indicators, and stipulated specific measures plans. However, some factories and mines have not specifically discussed the issue of improving product quality, have not stipulated indicators for improving product quality, and have not formulated specific technical measures plans. This will result in fewer tricks for improving product quality and the phenomenon of poor product quality cannot be quickly eliminated. This deserves serious attention. In view of the fact that the quality of our industrial products is not high, and the quality of products directly affects people's lives and current production and construction, as well as the foundation for China's long-term industrial construction in the future, the Northeast People's Government Industrial Department vigorously carried out the quality inspection campaign last year and achieved great gains. However, the quality problems of some products have not been completely resolved in the quality inspection campaign. Since the "Three-Anti" movement, some factories and mines have relaxed the implementation of inspection systems and technical operating procedures, so that the quality of some products has declined again. Therefore, in the increase production and practice economy campaign, we must seriously pay attention to solving the quality problem. No matter which factory or mine enterprise, if it has not paid good attention to the quality problem when discussing the plan, it should review the already formulated plan and conduct a "quality make-up lesson," mobilize all employees to discuss quality indicators, formulate specific technical measures plans, strictly implement the inspection system and technical operating procedures, and reward employees who find tricks to improve quality, in order to arouse universal attention to improving product quality and prevent and oppose the bias of "only emphasizing quantity and not quality."
    As for basic construction, it is the most important component of the current national plan, and it must be completed on schedule and with special attention to ensuring quality, which is the greatest increase in production and economy in basic construction. Therefore, all employees engaged in basic construction must fully understand the significance of ensuring quality and completing the work on schedule, learn and promote advanced experience, and formulate specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy, so as to ensure that the project is done "well, quickly, and economically."
    (2) Pay attention to security work and employee welfare
    Judging from the situation of the factories and mines under the Industrial Department, many units have not done a good job in this year's security work, and casualties continue to occur. In five months, there have been 25 major fires, with losses of approximately 37 billion yuan. These situations are serious and must be paid attention to. All factories and mines must seriously discuss security work, formulate safety measures plans, include them in the increase production and practice economy plans of factories, mines, workshops, and groups, designate special personnel to be responsible, and complete them within a time limit. Education on security work should be carried out among all employees, the maintenance of machinery and equipment should be strengthened, measures to prevent accidents should be taken, and safe production should be ensured. The main administrative cadres should strengthen their leadership over security work and continue to strictly enforce the responsibility system, and legal sanctions should be given to all those who neglect their duties.
    For the employees' livelihood and welfare issues, all those that urgently need to be resolved at present and can be resolved should be actively sought to be resolved. In addition to checking the production situation, party committees, administrative departments, and trade union organizations at all levels must also pay attention to checking the employees' livelihood and welfare, pay attention to the employees' reflections and requirements, quickly study improvement methods, formulate specific plans, designate special personnel to be responsible, and resolve them within a time limit. A bureaucratic attitude should not be adopted. The ideological and political leadership of personnel in the general affairs section, medical clinic, canteen, cooperative, and other departments should be strengthened, their political awareness should be improved, their work style should be improved, and they should do their work better and better serve the working class and the country's industrialization.
    The party committees, administrative departments, and trade unions of all factories and mines should specifically discuss the issue of security work and employee welfare in order to improve the work in this area.
    (3) Promote advanced production experience with leadership and organization
    At the beginning of this increase production and practice economy campaign, we emphasized that we should pay attention to the promotion of advanced production experience. When organizing employees to discuss the national plan and formulate the increase production and practice economy plan, many factories and mines paid attention to simultaneously conducting education on "digging potential and finding tricks" among employees. Therefore, since the start of the campaign, a large number of tricks have emerged, enabling production to be improved and enhanced. The Industrial Department, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, and the party committees of various localities have also paid attention to promoting important advanced production experience and advanced production management methods with universal significance under leadership, such as Su Changyou's bricklaying method in basic construction, high-speed and rapid cutting and multi-tool and multi-blade cutting methods in the machinery industry, and the "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" promoted this time. These measures are correct and should be continued.
    However, the leading comrades of some factories and mines still do not pay much attention to this important work. The publicity for finding tricks and learning tricks among employees is relatively poor. The number of tricks that have emerged in such factories and mines in the past month or so is very small. There are also some leaders of factories and mines who, when some tricks appear among employees, do not promptly organize technical personnel to combine with workers to comprehensively improve them, and find out the ones with universal significance to vigorously organize and promote them, but instead adopt varying degrees of laissez-faire attitude. These attitudes are of course incorrect and should be corrected. Currently, it is common for factories under the leadership of the same management bureau not to know about each other's achievements, but are busy "inventing" things that others have already invented. It is even more common for enterprises in the same city not to know about the experience of advanced units. Therefore, organizing the promotion of advanced experience within the Northeast region and within various provinces and cities according to the industrial system has become an urgent task.
    Promoting advanced production experience and turning every advanced production experience into everyone's experience and social wealth is the most important regular task of economic management agencies and trade union organizations. The so-called formalism in leading production competition movements is mainly manifested in being limited to general political mobilization and not specifically organizing the promotion of advanced production experience. Obviously, such competition cannot be sustained and regular. This year's increase production and practice economy competition should completely avoid this problem. In order to promote advanced production experience well, the leaders of all enterprise agencies must study economic knowledge and be proficient in their own business. First of all, they must understand the nature and role of every advanced production experience in the enterprise, understand the significance of every rationalization proposal of the masses, and be keenly aware of all new things in production, so that they can more effectively promote and organize employees to learn advanced production experience, and truly achieve specific leadership, rather than so-called "general" leadership.
    For the promotion of important advanced production experience and advanced production management methods with universal significance, specific plans should be formulated, progress should be stipulated, and inspections should be carried out on schedule. A laissez-faire attitude must not be adopted. This work should be personally responsible by the leading comrades of various enterprise agencies and trade union organizations, and special personnel should be designated to carry out daily work.
    In order to ensure the smooth promotion of advanced production experience, the correct wage and reward policy must be implemented. The quota problem should be resolved in accordance with the national regulations on quota policy, and the quota should not be modified frequently and casually, which affects the workers' production mood. For management personnel, technical personnel, and political work cadres who have made achievements in organizing and promoting advanced production experience, appropriate reward methods should be stipulated and rewarded.
    (4) Promote the organization of rhythmic production according to instruction charts
    With the emergence of various advanced experiences in production technology, our enterprise production management methods are required to undergo new reforms in order to better organize various advanced production experiences, adjust the imbalance in the production process, and give full play to the advanced role of various advanced production experiences. Organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts is an important reform of such a production management method. Shixian Paper Mill first learned this advanced experience in 1950. With the improvement of our enterprise management level, now we have learned this advanced experience in the most complex machinery industry, Machine Factory No. 3. This is a major progress in our enterprise management methods.
    On the one hand, organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts strengthens the organization and planning in production management. Relying on this scientific method, the leaders and all employees have a clear idea and avoid the blindness in production. Therefore, it completely overcomes the phenomenon of tightness and looseness caused by uneven production. This tightness and looseness in production not only damages the physical health of employees (requiring overtime and rush production), but also often affects product quality and increases non-production expenses. It is a disaster in enterprise production. Especially, the more advanced production methods that appear, the easier it is to cause imbalance in the production process (because some departments have made great strides, while other departments have not kept up). Therefore, the more advanced production experience is advocated, the more necessary it is to organize rhythmic production according to instruction charts. On the other hand, this new production management method can also specialize labor division (implementing the "three fixings" of fixed machine, fixed person, and fixed work), which is convenient for improving the technology and labor productivity of employees and improving product quality. Therefore, learning this scientific production management method can give full play to the role of various advanced production experiences, continuously overcome the imbalance in production development, maintain the balance in progress, and achieve rhythmic production. Just like the conductor of an orchestra, when he truly masters the complex rhythm of a piece of music, he can give full play to the skills of each performer without causing discordant tones.
    Organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts is an important reform in production management methods and should be promoted in all production enterprises, not just in the machinery industry. On the contrary, since it can be learned and promoted in the most complex machinery industry, it shows that today's management level has the conditions to gradually organize learning and promote this advanced production management method in all production enterprises.
    (5) Continue to deepen political work and fully mobilize the masses
    Through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the increase production and practice economy campaign last year, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and workers have been greatly improved. The rapid development of this increase production and practice economy campaign, with far fewer ideological obstacles than last year, and the greatly exceeded plans and the large number of tricks that have emerged, have fully proved this. We believe that the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses will continue to improve. Therefore, any conservative ideas that underestimate the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, any negative emotions that are afraid of new things (such as organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts), and any "stage theory" practices that do not meet the requirements of the movement must be criticized and corrected. The masses are actively moving forward by leaps and bounds, and we must strive to always be in front.
    However, we must not conclude from this that the leadership can be laissez-faire and blindly optimistic. We must deeply understand the various new ideological trends among the masses, various new problems in production, and solve them at any time in order to improve the masses' awareness and promote the increase production and practice economy campaign. For example: at present, there is a conservative idea among some workers that "the potential has been exhausted and the tricks have been found." Some workers also have so-called "four fears" (fear of losing points, fear of being transferred, fear that the plan is too high to complete, fear that the supply of materials will not keep up after the increase in production); cadres have so-called "two fears" (fear that the supply of materials will not keep up, fear of production imbalance); technical personnel and staff have four kinds of concerns (raw materials are not supplied, production is unbalanced, promoting tricks is not beneficial to individuals, managing money and materials is sticky). Without sweeping away these ideological obstacles, the increase production and practice economy campaign cannot move forward smoothly.
    Therefore, political work should be continuously strengthened with the deepening of the movement, and new ideological education should be conducted for employees. Some advanced factories have created some experience in deepening ideological education in this campaign, cultivated and established typical examples of advanced figures, and展开ed discussions through typical ideological reports, which have been very effective. This lively and vivid political work method is worth promoting. However, some factories and mines have not sufficiently conducted in-depth ideological education for employees in the discussion and formulation of plans, and the masses have not been fully mobilized. All such factories and mines should combine the promotion of advanced production experience and seriously conduct education on the increase production and practice economy campaign for employees, so as to mobilize every employee. All factories and mines that have not started ideological criticism and democratic make-up lessons should make some preparations in June and gain pilot experience, so as to展开 them under leadership in July and August in order to improve the thinking of factory and mine cadres relying on the working class and the political awareness of the masses of employees. The experience of Northeast-level agencies has proven that this is a very important ideological construction work and should be carried out seriously.

    高岗同志在东北工业部和东北总工会联合召开的先进生产经验推广大会上的讲话
    从五月七日动员开展增产节约运动以来，已经一个多月了。一个多月来，运动的进展是迅速的，广大职工已经热烈地行动起来，大多数厂矿已经制订出自己的增产节约计划。根据初步的统计，全区国营公营工业增产节约计划总值已经超过了一千万吨粮食，这个数目在经过群众讨论后，还将超过。干部和群众对增产节约的积极性很高，对自己制订的计划满怀着“只能超过，不能落后”的胜利信心，并纷纷想办法找窍门，仅沈阳一地，运动以来就出现了一万一千七百个窍门（去年增产节约运动开始后三个月仅出现四千五百个）。这些，都说明今年的增产节约运动，在许多新的有利的条件下，比去年发展得更为饱满和富有生气。但是，运动的发展并不是平衡的，按系统说，工业部所属单位较好，其他部、局及地方工业较差；按地区说，沈阳地区的较好，鞍山、大连等地较差。有的地区和有些单位，要到六月底才能讨论和订好计划，在讨论计划中，有不少的厂矿没有具体地讨论提高质量的问题，也没有具体地讨论安全福利问题，增产节约和推广先进经验中也还存在着一些思想问题和组织问题。
    为了使增产节约运动更深入地和更饱满地开展起来，把运动进一步推向高潮，必须着重解决以下几个问题：
    （一）保证产品和工程质量，全面完成国家计划和增产节约计划
    我们每个同志必须清楚了解，完成国家计划和超计划地增产节约，其具体要求是：①不仅要按照各工业部门来平均完成和超过计划，而且要每个企业、车间、小组和机台都超额完成计划；②不仅要按照生产总值完成和超过计划，而且要每种产品（特别是主要产品）都超额完成计划；③不仅要按照数量指标完成和超过计划，而且要在质量和成本指标上超额完成计划；④不仅要按年按季完成和超过计划，而且要按月按周甚至按日超额完成计划。
    在讨论国家计划和制订增产节约计划时，许多先进的厂矿都做到了按照上述要求全面地讨论计划，注意完成各方面的指标，并规定出具体的措施计划。但也有一些厂矿，没有具体地讨论提高产品质量问题，没有规定产品质量提高的指标，更没有制订具体的技术措施计划，这样就会使改进产品质量的窍门出现的少，产品质量低劣的现象不能很快消灭，这是值得严重注意的。鉴于我们的工业产品质量不高，而产品质量好坏不仅直接关系着人民的生活和当前的生产建设，也关系着今后我国的长期工业建设基础，因此，东北人民政府工业部在去年曾大力开展质量检查运动，并有了很大的收获，但某些产品的质量问题，在质量检查运动中，尚未完全解决；而“三反”运动以来，有些厂矿对检查制度和技术操作规程的贯彻执行有些松弛，以致有些产品的质量又有些下降。因此，在增产节约运动中，必须认真注意解决质量问题，不论哪一个厂矿企业，凡是讨论计划时没有很好注意质量问题的，应对已经制订的计划实行复查，进行一次“质量补课”，发动全体职工讨论质量指标，订出具体的技术措施计划，严格贯彻检查制度和技术操作规程，对找到提高质量的窍门的职工，进行奖励，以引起普遍重视改善产品质量，防止和反对“只重数量，不重质量”的偏向。
    至于基本建设，则是当前国家计划中最重要的组成部分，必须做到按期完工，并特别注意保证质量，而这就是基本建设中最大的增产节约。因此，必须使进行基本建设的全体职工充分认识保证质量和按期完工的意义，学习和推广先进经验，制订增产节约具体计划，以保证工程做的“又好、又快、又省”。
    （二）注意保安工作和职工福利
    从工业部所属厂矿的情况来看，有不少单位对今年的保安工作是做得不好的，伤亡事故不断发生，五个月已发生重大火灾二十五次，损失约三百七十亿元，这些情况是严重的，必须引起注意。各个厂矿均须认真讨论保安工作，订出安全措施计划，列入厂矿、车间、小组的增产节约计划中，指定专人负责，限期完成。要在全体职工中进行保安工作的教育，加强机械设备的检修工作，做好防止事故的措施，保证安全生产。主要行政干部要加强对保安工作的领导，并继续严格责任制度，对一切失职者要给以法律制裁。
    对于职工的生活福利问题，凡是当前迫切需要解决而又可能解决的，均应积极设法解决。各级党委、行政、工会组织，除检查生产情况外，必须同时注意检查职工的生活福利，重视职工的反映与要求，迅速研究改进的办法，订出具体计划，指定专人负责，限期解决，不应当采取官僚主义的态度。对于总务科、医务所、食堂、合作社等部门的人员，应加强思想政治领导，提高他们的政治觉悟，改善他们的工作作风，使他们把自己的工作做好，更好地为工人阶级和国家的工业化服务。
    所有厂矿的党委、行政、工会均应专门讨论一次保安工作和职工福利问题，以改进这一方面的工作。
    （三）有领导有组织地推广先进生产经验
    这次增产节约运动开始时，我们就强调要注意先进生产经验的推广。许多厂矿在组织职工讨论国家计划和制订增产节约计划时，就注意了在职工中同时进行“挖潜力、找窍门”的教育，因而从运动开始以来，出现了大量的窍门，使生产获得改进和提高。工业部、东北总工会以及各个地方党委，又注意了有领导地推广带有普遍意义的重要先进生产经验与先进的生产管理方法，如基本建设施工中的苏长有砌砖法，机械工业中的高速与快速切削及多刀多刃切削法，以及此次推广的“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”等，这些措施都是正确的，应当继续坚持下去。
    但有些厂矿的领导同志，至今对这一重要工作还不很重视，在职工中宣传找窍门和学习窍门做得比较差，这样的厂矿一个多月来出现的窍门寥寥无几。也有一些厂矿的领导者，当职工中出现了一些窍门时，没有及时组织技术人员结合工人去加以综合提高，并从中找出具有普遍意义的大力加以组织推广，而是采取了不同程度的放任自流态度。这些态度当然是不正确的，应当加以改正。目前，同属于一个管理局领导的各工厂而不知道相互间的成就，却忙于“发明”别人早已发明出的东西，是常有的事；而同在一个城市里的企业互不知道先进单位的经验，更是普遍的现象。因此，在东北全区范围内和各个省市范围内，按产业系统组织先进经验的推广，已成为一个迫切的工作。
    推广先进生产经验，把每一个先进生产经验变成大家的经验和社会的财富，是经济管理机关及工会组织最重要的经常的任务。所谓领导生产竞赛运动中的形式主义，其主要表现是只限于进行一般的政治鼓动，不去具体地组织先进生产经验的推广，显然的，这样的竞赛是不能持久和经常的，今年的增产节约竞赛，应当完全避免这种毛病。为了很好地推广先进生产经验，一切企业机关的领导者，必须学习经济知识和通晓自己的业务，首先使自己懂得企业中每一个先进生产经验的性质和作用，懂得群众每一个合理化建议的意义，敏锐地对待生产中的一切新事物，才能更有效地去推动和组织职工学习先进生产经验，才能真正做到具体领导，而不是所谓“一般地”领导。
    推广带普遍意义的重要先进生产经验与先进的生产管理方法，应当订出具体的计划，规定进度，并按期检查，决不能采取自流的态度。这个工作应当由各企业机关和工会组织的领导同志亲自负责，并指定专人进行日常工作。
    为了保证先进生产经验的顺利推广，必须贯彻执行正确的工资和奖励政策。要按照国家规定的定额政策解决定额问题，不许随便频繁地修改定额，影响工人生产情绪。对于组织推广先进生产经验有成绩的管理人员、技术人员以及政治工作干部，应规定适当的奖励办法予以奖励。
    （四）推行按指示图表组织有节奏生产
    随着生产技术上各种先进经验的出现，要求我们的企业生产管理方法进行新的改革，以便更好地组织各种先进生产经验，调节生产过程中的不平衡现象，充分发挥各种先进生产经验的先进作用。按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，正是这样一种生产管理方法的重要的改革。一九五○年石岘造纸厂最早学习了这种先进经验，随着我们企业管理水平的提高，现在我们在生产管理最复杂的机械工业中，机器三厂又学习了这一先进经验，这是我们企业管理方法上的一大进步。
    按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，一方面，加强了生产管理中的组织性和计划性，依靠这种科学的方法，使领导者和全体职工都心中有数，避免了生产中的盲目性，因而也就彻底克服了由于生产不均衡所形成的忽松忽紧现象，而这种生产中的忽松忽紧，既损害了职工的身体健康（要加班加点突击生产），又常常影响了产品质量和增大了非生产的开支，是企业生产中的灾害。特别是先进生产方法出现的越多，就越容易发生生产过程中的不平衡（因为有的部门前进了很大一步，而另一些部门还未跟上来），因此越是提倡先进生产经验，就越需要按指示图表组织有节奏的生产。另一方面，这种新的生产管理方法，又可能使劳动分工专业化（实行定机器、定人、定活的“三定”），便于提高职工的技术和劳动生产率，并提高产品质量。因此，学会了这一科学的生产管理方法，就能够充分发挥各种先进生产经验的作用，就能够不断克服生产发展中的不平衡现象，保持前进中的均衡性，做到有节奏地生产。正像一个乐队的指挥者一样，当他真正掌握了一个乐曲的复杂的节奏时，他才能充分发挥每个演奏者的技能，而又不至于发生不合谐的音调。
    按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，既是一个生产管理方法上的重要改革，就应当在一切生产企业推广，并不是只在机械工业中适用。相反的，既然在生产管理最复杂的机械工业中可以学习和推广，那就说明今天的管理水平，已有条件逐步地在所有生产企业中组织学习和推广这个先进生产管理方法了。
    （五）继续深入政治工作，充分发动群众
    通过“三反”“五反”及去年增产节约运动，广大干部及职工群众的政治觉悟与生产热情大大地提高了，这次增产节约运动的迅速开展，思想障碍的远较去年为少，计划的大大超过和窍门的大量出现，已经可以充分证明这一点。我们相信群众的积极性、创造性还会不断提高。因此，任何对群众积极性、创造性估计不足的保守思想，任何对新鲜事物（如按指示图表组织有节奏的生产）畏缩不前的消极情绪，任何不适合运动要求的“阶段论”的做法，都要批判改正。群众正在积极地大踏步前进，我们必须努力地经常走在前面。
    但从这里决不能得出结论说领导上可以自流，可以盲目乐观。我们必须深入了解群众中的各种新的思想动态，生产中的各种新的问题，随时解决，以提高群众觉悟，推进增产节约运动。譬如：目前有一部分工人当中存在着“潜力挖光、窍门找绝”的保守思想，有些工人还有所谓“四怕”（怕掉点，怕调动，怕计划高了完不成，怕增产后材料供应不上）；干部中有所谓“两怕”（怕材料供应不上，怕生产不平衡）；技术人员和职员中有四种顾虑
    （原材料供应不上，生产不平衡，推广窍门对个人没利益，管钱管物沾包）。不扫清这些思想障碍，增产节约运动就不能顺利地前进。
    因此，应当随着运动的深入，不断加强政治工作，对职工进行新的思想教育。有些先进工厂在这次运动中，创造了一些深入思想教育的经验，培养和树立先进人物的典型，通过典型思想报告，展开讨论，收效很大，这种生动活泼的政治工作方法，值得推广。但有些厂矿在讨论制订计划中，对职工深入进行思想教育不够，群众发动的不充分，所有这样的厂矿，应当结合推广先进生产经验，再认真对职工深入进行增产节约运动的教育，务求把每一个职工都发动起来。凡是没有开始进行思想批判和民主补课的厂矿，应当在六月份进行一些准备，取得试点经验，以便在七、八月份有领导地展开，以提高厂矿干部依靠工人阶级的思想和职工群众的政治觉悟。东北一级机关的经验证明，这是一项很重要的思想建设工作，应当认真进行。
