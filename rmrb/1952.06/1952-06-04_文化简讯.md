Cultural Briefs

    ▲ Since the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Shanghai Second Military Medical University Hospital began implementing painless childbirth methods in March of this year, the results have been good. According to statistics, among 34 parturients, 23.4% had excellent results, 52.9% had good results (meaning they only felt tired after childbirth), 20.8% had fair results (meaning the parturients felt slight soreness during childbirth but did not cry out in pain), and 2.9% had no effect. Obstetricians and gynecologists in Shanghai are also interested in the Soviet Union's painless childbirth methods and have expressed their willingness to study them diligently.
    ▲ In order to promote the "wheat aphid pushing cart" created by farmer Jin Hongle of the 13th District of Beijing and to further research and improve it, the Chinese Academy of Sciences invited experts from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the North China Agricultural Science Institute, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and relevant cadres from the Beijing Suburban Work Committee and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization to a symposium on May 24. The creator, Jin Hongle, was also invited to participate. All the experts unanimously praised this creation, believing it has a great effect on capturing pests such as wheat aphids, wheat sawflies, and red spiders. The symposium decided to establish a small group including Jin Hongle, agricultural tool experts, and entomology experts to specifically study and improve the method, so as to suggest large-scale promotion to relevant departments.
    ▲ In order to consolidate the achievements of last year's winter literacy campaign and prepare for carrying out a comprehensive literacy campaign this year, the People's Government of Licheng County, Shanxi Province, will organize all primary school teachers and intellectuals in rural areas to establish a "Promotion Association for the Qi Jianhua Rapid Literacy Method." It plans to train 2,000 teachers in July to take on the teaching work of the rapid literacy method.
