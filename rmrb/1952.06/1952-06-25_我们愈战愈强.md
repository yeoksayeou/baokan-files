Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Korean People's War of Resistance Against America

    We Grow Stronger With Each Battle
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Cui Jianguo
    The Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the American imperialist aggression has been going on for two years. In the past two years, the Korean people, with the support of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, have fought bravely and achieved brilliant victories. Two years ago, the American aggressors launched an offensive north of the 38th Parallel. After fighting for two years and paying a heavy price, they are still struggling near the 38th Parallel today. The plan of American imperialism to cross the Yalu River and expand the war of aggression has been completely shattered by us and will never be realized.
    In the winter of the year before last, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, shouldering the sacred mission of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," went abroad to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, demonstrating unparalleled heroism and tenacity. Relying on light weapons such as rifles and hand grenades, we defeated the enemy with superior equipment, drove them from the Yalu River to south of the 38th Parallel, and liberated vast territories in northern Korea. The reason why we are able to fight fearlessly in spite of all difficulties and win battles under extremely difficult conditions is because we possess a lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism. We love our motherland, we love peace, and we recognize that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people of the world, so we are fearless, and we can dedicate everything to the cause of defending our motherland and defending world peace. This is completely different from the enemy's soldiers, who still don't know why they are fighting. Two years of fighting have already proved to the people of the world that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are the bravest and most capable armies in the world, and that the Chinese and Korean people are an invincible force. Our victory is inseparable from the wise leadership of the great leaders of China and Korea, Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, and the enthusiastic support of the people of the world. In the past two years, we have grown stronger with each battle. Today, we not only have rich war experience, but our equipment has also been greatly improved. We have more favorable conditions to defeat the enemy. The myth of American imperialism's so-called "air superiority" has been completely shattered.
    A year ago, the American aggressors, because of their disastrous defeats on the battlefield, were forced to accept armistice negotiations. However, the United States has been arrogant and unreasonable in the negotiations, using all kinds of despicable means to obstruct the reaching of an agreement; at the same time, it has continued to provoke incidents outside the conference, destroy the neutral zone, and murder our negotiators and guards in order to delay and sabotage the negotiations. This fully proves that the United States lacks the sincerity to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. But we have enough strength to crush the American conspiracy to delay and sabotage the negotiations, and if the American aggressors dare to sabotage the negotiations, we will resolutely give them a merciless blow.
    American imperialism, at the end of its rope, has even used the genocidal bacteriological weapons in an attempt to poison the Chinese and Korean people and save their defeated fate; recently, it has also shamelessly abused and massacred our captured personnel. These atrocities have aroused great anger among the people of the world. The soldiers of our Volunteer Army hate these cruel and criminal acts of the enemy even more, and we must redouble our efforts to strike at the enemy and avenge our suffering brothers and sisters.
    The commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are closely watching the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom, resolutely supporting the reasonable demands put forward by our representatives, while remaining vigilant and preparing to defeat the enemy's offensive at any time. Because I personally completed my combat missions on the front lines, I have been rewarded and loved by the Korean people and the people of the motherland. I will never let down the honor they have given me, and I am determined to earn more merits to repay the love of the Chinese and Korean people. We firmly believe that peace in Korea will surely be realized, and that victory will surely belong to the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.

    我们愈战愈强
    中国人民志愿军战斗英雄  崔建国
    朝鲜人民抵抗美帝国主义侵略的卫国战争进行两年了。两年来朝鲜人民在中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支援下英勇作战，取得了辉煌的胜利。两年前，美国侵略者向三八线以北发动进攻，打了两年，付出了很大代价，结果到今天还在三八线附近挣扎。美帝国主义越过鸭绿江扩大侵略战争的计划，已被我们彻底粉碎，永远不能实现了。
    我们中国人民志愿军前年冬天负着“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的神圣任务出国与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，表现了无比的英勇和顽强。我们靠步枪、手榴弹等轻武器就战胜了优势装备的敌人，把敌人从鸭绿江边赶到三八线以南，解放了朝鲜北部广大的土地。我们所以能够不怕一切困难，奋不顾身地作战，在极度艰苦的条件下打胜仗，就是因为我们具有崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神。我们热爱我们的祖国，热爱和平，我们认识美帝国主义是世界人民的死敌，所以我们是无畏的，我们能把一切献给保卫祖国与保卫世界和平的事业。这和敌人的士兵到现在还不知道他们为何而战是完全不同的。两年的战斗，已在世界人民面前证明了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军是世界上最勇敢善战的军队，证明了中朝人民是不可被战胜的力量。我们的胜利，是和中朝两国伟大领袖毛主席和金日成将军的英明领导，和世界人民的热烈支援分不开的。两年以来，我们是愈战愈强了。今天我们不仅有了丰富的战争经验，我们的装备也已大大改善。我们有更多有利的条件击败敌人。美帝国主义什么“空中优势”之类的神话都完全破产了。
    一年以前，美国侵略者因为在战场上遭到悲惨的失败，被迫接受进行停战谈判。但是，美国在谈判会议中蛮横无理，用各种卑鄙手段阻挠达成协议；同时不断在会外进行挑衅，破坏中立区，谋杀我方谈判代表和守卫人员，以拖延和破坏谈判。这充分证明美国是缺乏和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意的。但是我们有足够的力量粉碎美国拖延和破坏谈判的阴谋诡计，如果美国侵略者胆敢破坏谈判，我们决予以无情的打击。
    美帝国主义穷途末路，竟使用灭绝人性的细菌武器，妄图毒害中朝人民，挽救他们失败的命运；最近又无耻地虐待和屠杀我们的被俘人员。这些暴行都已激起了全世界人民的极大愤怒。我们志愿军的战士们，对于敌人这种残暴的罪恶行为更是切齿痛恨，我们一定要加倍打击敌人，为我们受难的兄弟姊妹复仇。
    我们志愿军和朝鲜人民军的指战员们，都密切注意着板门店的停战谈判会议，坚决拥护我方代表提出的合理主张，同时提高警惕，准备随时击败敌人的进攻。我本人因为在前线完成了战斗任务，受到朝鲜人民和祖国人民的奖励和爱护，我绝不辜负他们给我的荣誉，决心争取立更多的功劳，来回答中朝人民的热爱。我们坚信朝鲜的和平一定能够实现，胜利必然属于中朝人民和世界人民的。
