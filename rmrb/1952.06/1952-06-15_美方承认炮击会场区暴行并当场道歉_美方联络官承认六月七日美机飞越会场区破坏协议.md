    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th: Our liaison officer, at the request of the U.S. liaison officer, jointly investigated the incident on June 5th in which the U.S. side shelled the conference area, injuring Korean children within the area. The U.S. Chief Liaison Officer, Mr. Murray, personally saw many shrapnel fragments and impact marks within the conference area, and heard the testimonies of local residents. However, he still stated that he could not draw a conclusion and requested that the liaison officers of both sides continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. In fact, the U.S. side's violation of the agreement on June 5th had already been admitted by the U.S. side during the joint investigation by the security officers of both sides. At the very beginning of the on-site investigation on the 13th, Murray attempted to deny the fact that the U.S. shells had landed in the conference area by claiming that the wooden stakes, which had been jointly used as boundary markers for the conference area by both sides for more than seven months, were inaccurately set. He insisted that the markers were inaccurate and did not count, even though the shrapnel clearly fell within the marked boundary of the conference area. He stubbornly argued that the shrapnel falling within the marked boundary was not within the conference area. Our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, solemnly pointed out: The markers jointly established by the security officers of both sides, executing the instructions of the liaison officers of both sides, have been in place for more than seven months, and their validity is beyond question. U.S. shrapnel falling within the marked boundary means it fell within the conference area, and there is no room for denial. Murray stood in a wheat field within the conference area, which was covered in impact marks, sometimes smirking, sometimes looking around, not wanting to investigate the facts at all, and repeatedly making his sophistical arguments for up to two hours.
    Next, Colonel Zhang pointed out: The shrapnel not only fell in the area that Murray was trying to insist was outside the conference area, but also in other areas more internal to the conference area. Murray tried various means to evade the issue without success, and had to go back to investigate. In a wheat field, several pieces of U.S. shrapnel were immediately found. And this area, even according to Murray's definition of the boundary of the conference area, was within the conference area. At this point, Murray followed Colonel Zhang in silence to question the witnesses. Residents of the conference area, Yin Yongxian and Wu Rongxue, not only truthfully reported the situation of the U.S. shelling of the conference area, but also righteously described the tragic scene of U.S. shells killing and injuring Korean children.
    Faced with irrefutable witness testimony and physical evidence, Murray, who had originally wanted to exploit loopholes to deny what the U.S. security officer had already admitted, had nothing more to say. However, he still requested to continue the discussion on the morning of the 14th. But in the discussion at 9:00 AM on the 14th, finally, because the evidence was conclusive and could not be denied, the U.S. side had to admit that they had shelled the conference area and apologized on the spot.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th: The U.S. side admitted on the 14th that two jet aircraft violated the agreement on June 7th by flying over the Panmunjom conference area. At the liaison officers' meeting on the morning of the 14th, the U.S. liaison officer Murray expressed "regret" over the occurrence of this incident and stated that they would "continue to strive to avoid flying over." Just over a week ago, the U.S. side admitted that their military aircraft flew over the conference area on May 23rd. At that time, they also claimed to "regret" it and guaranteed that they would "continue to strive to avoid flying over."

    美方承认炮击会场区暴行并当场道歉
    美方联络官承认六月七日美机飞越会场区破坏协议
    【新华社开城十四日电】十三日我方联络官应美方联络官的要求，共同调查六月五日美方炮击会场区打伤区内朝鲜儿童事件。美方首席联络官穆莱亲眼看到会场区内许多弹片、弹痕，亲耳听到当地居民的证词，但还说尚不能得出结论，要求十四日上午九时双方联络官继续会晤。事实上，六月五日美方违反协议的事件，在双方安全军官共同调查中，美方已经承认。十三日刚一开始现场调查，穆莱就以七个多月双方共同用作标志会场区区界的木桩设置不准确为由，企图抵赖美方炮弹打进会场区内的事实。明明弹片落在会场区的明显标志界内，他硬说标志不准确，不算数，硬说落在标志界内的弹片不是落在会场区内，我方首席联络官张春山上校严正指出：双方安全军官执行双方联络官指示共同确立的标志，已经七个多月，其有效性无可置疑。美国弹片落在标志界内，就是落在会场区内，不容抵赖。而穆莱站在会场区内的一片到处都有弹痕的麦地上，时而冷笑，时而四处张望，根本不想调查事实，一味重复他的诡辩，先后达两个多小时。
    接着，张上校指出：弹片不但落在穆莱企图硬说成是会场区外的这块地方，而且还落在其他在会场区更内部的地方。穆莱多方企图逃避未果，只好再去调查。在一块麦地里，立刻就检出了好几块美国弹片。而这一块地方，即使按照穆莱所说的会场区界，也是在会场区内的。这时，穆莱才默无一言地跟着张上校去询问证人。会场区内居民尹永宪和吴容学，不仅把美方炮击会场区的情况据实以告。并且理直气壮地叙述了美国炮弹杀死打伤朝鲜儿童的凄惨情景。
    在无可辩驳的人证、物证面前，本来想钻空子抵赖美方安全军官已经亲口承认的事实的穆莱，再也无话可说。但是他还要求十四日晨继续讨论。但在十四日上午九时的讨论中，终于因为证据确凿，无法抵赖，美方不得不承认他们炮击会场区，并当场表示道歉。
    【新华社开城十四日电】美方十四日承认六月七日曾有两架喷气式飞机破坏协议，飞越板门店会场区上空。在十四日晨的双方联络官会议上，美方联络官穆莱对此事的发生“引为遗憾”，并称将“继续努力避免飞越”。仅仅一周多前，美方曾承认五月二十三日他们的军用飞机飞越会场区，当时他们也同样声称“引为遗憾”，并保证“将继续努力避免飞越”。
