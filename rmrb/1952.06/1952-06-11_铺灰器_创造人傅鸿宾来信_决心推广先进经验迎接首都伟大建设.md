To the Esteemed Editor: I accept the glorious task of participating in the construction of the capital with unparalleled excitement. Since arriving in Beijing from Tianjin, I have been warmly welcomed by fellow workers everywhere I go. I am so moved that I can't even sleep. I deeply realize that the working class is truly in charge now. The era of "construction workers suffering forty li of wind and stench" will never return.

    Looking back on the old society, we were oppressed and exploited by contractors and foremen. No matter how loudly we swung our trowels, we were still half-starved. We couldn't even afford clothes, let alone decent housing! If we got sick, nobody cared, and we were often unemployed. After liberation, the lives of workers changed dramatically. The People's Government promulgated the "Trade Union Law" and the "Labor Insurance Regulations," providing certain guarantees for workers' lives, old age, illness, disability, and employment. I became a long-term worker in a state-owned construction company, with work available year-round. The company established training classes to help us learn culture, politics, and improve our skills. And what about our living conditions on the construction site? We eat fine grains three times a day, and cooked vegetables too. The dormitories have screens on all the windows and doors. The work area has a cooperative store, a barber shop, and a bathhouse. The People's Bank regularly comes to the site to handle deposit and remittance services. A movie is shown every two weeks. The trade union is also planning to open a night school. The club is under construction and will soon be open for us to enjoy. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would never have dreamed of having such a happy life. The thought of Chairman Mao fills me with energy, and I can overcome any difficulty.

    Last year, Comrade Su Changyou came to Tianjin to demonstrate the "three-section continuous bricklaying method," which inspired my creative enthusiasm. After more than thirty experiments with my group, we created the "spreader," increasing work efficiency by more than threefold, and immediately received praise from the people. Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, encouraged me. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League awarded me a Five-Star Leader Image Model Medal. Students from schools all over sent me souvenirs. After I arrived in Beijing, Zhang Jin, Chairman of the National Construction Trade Union, and Yuan Zhi, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Construction Trade Union, also showed great concern for me. I have only done this little thing for the people, and I have received such respect and honor. This glory belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao! It belongs to the broad masses of the working people.

    Now, under the leadership of the Party, our work area has organized a committee for promoting advanced working methods. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has sent a working group, and the construction company has sent cadres to provide specific assistance. Engineers are working with us to study ways to improve technology, and the administrative department has prepared materials and tools. With determination from the leadership and confidence from us workers, we are prepared to fully promote these advanced working methods in August. We have already organized six groups to try out Su Changyou's "two-handed mortar squeezing bricklaying method," and have already achieved preliminary results.

    In this movement to promote advanced working methods, I guarantee that I will not be arrogant or complacent, and will humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the Northeast. I will improve my own cultural, political, and technical levels, better organize the labor force, and strengthen the connection between the transportation group and the bricklaying group, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy," and strive towards "faster, better, and more economical" construction to welcome the great construction of the capital.

    “铺灰器”创造人傅鸿宾来信
    决心推广先进经验迎接首都伟大建设
    编辑同志：我以无比兴奋的心情，接受参加首都建设的光荣任务。从天津来到北京，每到一个地方，我都受到工人同志们的热烈欢迎。我感动得觉都睡不着。我深深地体会到：工人阶级真正当家作主人了。“建筑工人顶风臭四十里”的时代再不会回来了。
    回想起在旧社会时，我们受着包商和把头的压迫、剥削，瓦刀敲得再响，也是饿着半个肚子。衣服都穿不上，住处更不用提啦！生了病没人管，还经常失业。解放后，工人的生活变了样。人民政府公布了“工会法”和“劳动保险条例”，工人的生、老、病、残和职业问题，有了一定的保障。我到国营建筑公司当长期工，一年四季有活干。公司开办训练班，帮助我们学文化、学政治和提高技术。再说我们施工现场的生活吧，一天三顿细粮，还吃熟菜。宿舍前后都有纱窗，工区设有合作社、理发馆和澡塘。人民银行定期来现场办理存款和汇款业务。隔两个星期还放映一次电影。工会还准备办夜校。俱乐部正在修盖，不久就可以进去玩了。要不是共产党和毛主席的领导，我作梦也没有想到会有这样幸福的日子。我一想起毛主席，混身有了劲，啥困难都能克服了。
    去年苏长有同志到天津表演“三段连续砌砖法”，启发了我的创造热情。我和小组的同志们经过三十多次的试验，创造了“铺灰器”，提高工作效率三倍多，立即得到人民的赞扬。天津市总工会黄火青主席鼓励了我。青年团天津市工作委员会奖给我五星领袖像模范奖章。各地学校的学生纷纷给我送纪念品。我到了北京，中华全国总工会建筑工会张进主席和北京市建筑工会袁峙副主席也十分关怀我。我只给人民作了这一点事，就获得这样的尊敬和荣誉。这光荣应该归于伟大的领袖毛主席！归于广大的劳动人民。
    现在，在党的领导下，我们工区组织了推广先进工作方法委员会。北京市总工会派来了工作组，建筑公司派来了干部，具体帮助我们。工程师和我们一起研究改进技术的办法，行政方面准备了材料和工具。领导方面有决心，我们工人有信心。我们准备在八月份全面地推广这些先进工作方法。目前我们已组织了六个小组，试行苏长有的“双手挤浆砌砖法”，并已获得初步成绩。
    在这次推广先进工作方法运动中，我保证不骄不傲，虚心学习苏联和东北的先进经验；提高自己的文化、政治和技术；更好地组织劳动力，加强运输组和砌砖组的联系，以便响应毛主席“增加生产厉行节约”的号召，向“又快、又好、又省”的方向努力，来迎接首都的伟大建设。
