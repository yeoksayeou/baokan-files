    I want to teach everyone my type-selection method
    Comrade Editor: This time I represented the workers of Henan to participate in the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations in the capital. On May 9th, I saw Chairman Mao in person at the music evening in Huairen Hall. Chairman Mao was very close to us. He saw that we were wearing red ribbons and knew we were labor model representatives, so he waved to us. I was so excited that I was sweating all over. Looking at today, I think even more of the pain of yesterday. In the old society, we printing workers had no job security, working here for three months and there for five months, living a life worse than animals. The capitalists said I was short-sighted and had no future. But now I still have these two hands, and I have received such great glory. The workers of our New China are now living very well, but we know that socialist life is even happier. We workers must strive for its speedy arrival. Therefore, we must work hard in production, learn advanced experiences, and create more wealth for the motherland. In the future, I will definitely study technology, connect with the masses, teach my working methods to everyone, help everyone improve their skills, and improve the old type-selection work method. 　Zhang Jiying

    我要把我的拣字法教给大家
    编辑同志：我这次代表河南工人到首都参加“五一”劳动节观礼。五月九日，我在怀仁堂的音乐晚会上亲眼看到了毛主席。毛主席离我们很近，他看见我们带着红条子，知道是劳动模范代表，就向我们招手。我兴奋得满头出汗。我看看今天，更想起了昨日的痛苦。我们印刷业工人在旧社会里工作没有保障，这里干三个月，那里干五个月，过着牛马不如的生活。资本家说我指短头小没出息。但我现在还是这两只手，却得到了这样大的荣耀。我们新中国的工人现在生活得都很好，但我们知道社会主义的生活是更幸福的。我们工人必须争取它的尽速到来。因此，我们要努力生产，学习先进经验，为祖国创造更多的财富。我今后一定钻研技术，联系群众，把我的工作方法教给大家，帮助大家提高技术，改进旧的拣字工作法。　张继英
