Visiting Burmese Representative U Law

On the eve of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, reporters visited Burmese representative U Law.

“The Burmese people are peace-loving and urgently need peace,” U Law said first. “During World War II, the Japanese imperialist army invaded Burma and turned Burma into a battlefield. The lives and property of the people, as well as cultural and artistic treasures, suffered great losses. Some cities were so badly damaged that not even one complete house remained. Therefore, no matter how the imperialists clamor for war, the Burmese people will not believe them. The imperialists ruled Burma for decades, but when the Japanese imperialist army invaded Burma, the imperialists fled Burma. This made the Burmese people realize that only the Burmese people themselves can defend their motherland.”

Painful experience has taught the Burmese people this truth. They abandoned their illusions about the imperialist rulers and took action themselves to safeguard peace and defend their country.

U Law briefly reviewed the development of the Burmese people's peace movement. Like the people of all countries in the world, after the victorious conclusion of the Prague World Congress for the Defense of Peace in 1949, a broad peace movement involving people from all walks of life also unfolded in Burma. The organization of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace was first established in large cities and then gradually expanded to small and medium-sized cities and counties. Participants in the peace movement included workers, farmers, youth, students, cultural and artistic workers, journalists, monks, and it also attracted some city councilors and members of parliament. U Law said, "In the peace movement, the political awareness of the Burmese people gradually increased, and they began to understand that the peace propagated by imperialism was not real peace." When the Korean War first broke out, the imperialists spread rumors that it was "North Korea's aggression" and that "the United Nations sending troops to Korea was justified." At this time, the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace collected a lot of materials and held mass rallies in various regions to explain that the Korean War was an aggressive war launched by the imperialists. After the Chinese People's Volunteers went to aid the Korean people, the imperialists again spread rumors and slandered, saying, "China has joined the war, and a world war is about to break out." The Peace Committee carried out extensive propaganda and education work to make the Burmese people understand that the Chinese People's Volunteers went to Korea to fight in order to defend their motherland and to defend true peace. Talking about this, the reporter recalled that when he visited Zhang Guozhuang in the suburbs of Beijing a few days ago, he specifically visited the wife of a volunteer soldier. Before leaving, he sincerely shook the hand of this glorious military family member and said:

"The Burmese people support your husband because he is fighting for peace."

In order to promote the peace movement, the All-Burma Congress for the Defense of World Peace was held from May 10th to 14th this year in the Jubilee Hall in Yangon. In addition to Yangon, representatives from twenty-two counties and representatives of various ethnic groups, a total of 328 people, participated in the congress, and 347 people attended as observers. The other eleven counties did not attend due to long distances, inconvenient transportation, and other reasons. U Law also summarized the sixteen resolutions on defending peace adopted by the congress:

1.  Demand that imperialists dismantle military bases in Asia;
2.  Oppose the rearmament of Japan;
3.  Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and germ warfare;
4.  Oppose French imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and British imperialism's aggression against Malaya;
5.  Imperialist troops get out of the Near East, the Middle East, and African countries, and do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries;
6.  Oppose the arming of West Germany, and unify Germany according to the will of the German people;
7.  Prohibit atomic weapons, germ bombs, and other weapons of mass destruction, and reduce armaments;
8.  Submit a protest to the United Nations, protesting U.S. imperialists' germ warfare and poison gas attacks in Korea;
9.  Promote cultural exchanges between countries to consolidate peace;
10. Establish normal, fair, and reasonable trade relations between countries to consolidate peace;
11. Raise funds for the World Peace Council, calling on the Burmese people to donate one anna (Burmese currency) each;
12. The Burmese people not only wholeheartedly support world peace and participate in the world peace movement, but also hope to stop domestic frictions, achieve domestic peace and unity, and prevent their motherland from becoming a battlefield again;
13. Drive the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's army out of Burma;
14. Cancel the U.S. imperialist "Mutual Security Act" in Burma;
15. Demand full democratic rights from the government;
16. Continue to collect signatures for the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact.

During the congress, a peace photo exhibition was also held, and the audience was very crowded every day. There were also literary, drawing, poetry, and music competitions centered on peace. At the same time, a drama about peace was staged in the Jubilee Hall. On the last day of the congress, the representatives of the congress and workers, farmers, and peace-loving people from all walks of life near Yangon held a demonstration parade to defend peace. According to the customs of the Burmese people, when mass rallies are held in cities and counties, they can solicit rice packages (rice and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves) from local residents. On that day, the Peace Committee collected more rice packages from the citizens of Yangon than the number of demonstrators. The people directly and indirectly supported the peace movement in this way, and more and more people experienced that the question of "peace or war?" was closely related to their lives.

"Currently, from big merchants to poor people who can barely make ends meet, their business and their lives are feeling difficult. Prices have risen slightly, but incomes have not increased," U Law said. "If it is said that some big merchants have suffered losses because they do not believe in world peace, I believe it is not wrong. Because some people listened to the imperialists' war propaganda, hoarding goods and seeking exorbitant profits; but the war did not break out, the people's purchasing power could not be improved, the goods could not be sold, the capital turnover was not smooth, and the bank was urging them to repay the loans, and some went bankrupt. If they believed in peace and ran legitimate businesses, maybe it wouldn't be like this." He mentioned the Moscow International Economic Conference, saying, "This conference has also greatly awakened the Burmese business community and broadened their horizons. They are preparing to communicate trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and they are looking forward to a peaceful and beautiful future for international trade."

The content of peace is also growing in the cultural life of the Burmese people. Many newly emerging young literary workers are praising peace in their works; art workers are depicting peace; music workers are singing peace; when the "Water Splashing Festival" (a Burmese holiday) arrives, people gather to celebrate, and peaceful songs are rippling everywhere, peaceful dances are jumping, and peace doves symbolizing the noble aspirations of mankind are floating in the队伍. U Law said, "Burmese cultural and artistic workers are engaged in creation not for money, so their lives are difficult, and they often do not have enough to eat and wear, but they can endure it for peace."

U Law himself is a writer, journalist, and publisher, and is also engaged in the peace movement. He is the editor of the Burmese People's Daily and People's Magazine, the chairman of the Upper Burma Newspaper Workers Association, the vice chairman of the Writers Association, and the special commissioner of the Upper Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace in Burma. U Law took out a recent Burmese People's Daily, which contained an editorial on the All-Burma Congress for the Defense of World Peace, news about the Japanese workers' "May Day" general strike, the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle, and U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. He said excitedly, "In Burma, this is the only newspaper that publishes news from Beijing Radio. In Yangon, some Chinese young students are selling newspapers for us. As far as I know, there are five subscribers in Beijing." U Law is one of the initiators of the Burmese people's peace movement. After the Stockholm Declaration was issued, U Law and his wife—the Burmese translator of "The Challenge of Red China"—as well as other cultural workers and students, once collected signatures door-to-door in Mandalay every day, and held mass meetings in various districts in the evening to promote peace. The peace advocates of Burma are working for peace day and night in this way. (Yang Zhaolin)

### 访缅甸代表吴拉

    访缅甸代表吴拉
    在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的前夕，记者们访问了缅甸代表吴拉。
     “缅甸人民是热爱和平、迫切需要和平的。”吴拉首先这样说：“在第二次世界大战当中，日本帝国主义军队侵入缅甸，把缅甸变成了战场，人民的生命财产、文化艺术宝藏都遭受了很大的损失，有些城市甚至破坏到连一间完整的房子都没有了。因此，无论帝国主义者如何叫嚣战争，缅甸人民都是不会相信的。帝国主义者统治缅甸几十年，而当日本帝国主义军队侵入缅甸的时候，帝国主义者却从缅甸逃跑了。这使缅甸人民认识到：只有缅甸人民自己才能保卫自己的祖国。”
    痛苦的经验使缅甸人民懂得了这一条真理，抛弃了对帝国主义统治者的幻想，自己行动起来维护和平、保卫祖国。
    吴拉简单地回顾了缅甸人民和平运动的发展状况。和世界各国人民一样，在一九四九年布拉格世界保卫和平大会胜利闭幕以后，包括各阶层人民的广泛的和平运动也在缅甸展开了。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会的组织首先在大城市建立起来，以后就逐渐扩展到各中小城市和各县去。参加和平运动的人有工人、农民、青年、学生、文化艺术工作者、新闻工作者、和尚，并且吸引了一部分市议员和国会议员。吴拉说：“在和平运动当中，缅甸人民的政治觉悟渐渐提高了，他们开始了解帝国主义所宣传的和平并不是真正的和平。”当朝鲜战争刚爆发的时候，帝国主义者造谣说那是“北朝鲜侵略”，“联合国派军队到朝鲜去是正当的”。这时候，缅甸保卫世界和平委员会就搜集了很多材料，在各个区域举行群众集会，说明朝鲜战争是帝国主义者发动的侵略战争。当中国人民志愿军出动援助朝鲜人民以后，帝国主义者又造谣中伤，说“中国参加战争了，世界大战就要爆发了”。和平委员会又进行了广泛的宣传教育工作，使缅甸人民了解：中国人民志愿军到朝鲜作战，是为了保卫祖国，是为了保卫真正的和平。吴拉谈到这里，记者回想起日前他参观北京市郊张郭庄的时候，曾经特地访问了一位志愿军的妻子。在临别的时候，他诚恳地握着这位光荣军属的手说：
    “缅甸人民是支持你的丈夫的，因为他是在为和平而斗争。”
    为了推进和平运动，今年五月十日到十四日，在仰光市柔美里厅，举行了全缅甸保卫世界和平代表大会。除了仰光市以外，有二十二个县的代表和各民族的代表一共三百二十八人参加大会，列席的有三百四十七人。其他的十一县，因为路途遥远、交通不便等原因，没有到会。吴拉并且概括地叙述了大会所通过的保卫和平的十六项决议：
    一、要求帝国主义者取消在亚洲的军事基地；
    二、反对重新武装日本；
    三、反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和进行细菌战；
    四、反对法帝国主义侵略越南，反对英帝国主义侵略马来亚；
    五、帝国主义军队从近东、中东和非洲各国滚出去，不要干涉别国的内政；
    六、反对武装西德，根据德国人民的意志统一德国；
    七、禁止原子武器、细菌弹和其他大规模毁灭人类的武器，裁减军备；
    八、向联合国提出抗议书，抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行细菌战和投掷毒气弹；
    九、促进各国之间的文化交流以巩固和平；
    十、建立各国之间的正常的、公平合理的贸易关系以巩固和平；
    十一、为世界和平理事会募集经费，号召缅甸人民每人捐一安（缅币）；
    十二、缅甸人民不仅全心全意地拥护世界和平，参加世界和平运动，而且希望停止国内的磨擦，实现国内的和平、团结，使自己的祖国不要再变成战场；
    十三、从缅甸境内赶走蒋介石残余军队；
    十四、取消美帝国主义在缅甸的“共同安全法”；
    十五、向政府要求充分的民主权利；
    十六、继续征集关于缔结五大国和平公约的签名。
    在大会期间，并且举行了和平图片展览会，每天的观众都是非常拥挤的；还举行了以和平为中心内容的文学、图画、诗歌、音乐比赛；同时在柔美里厅中上演了关于和平的话剧。在大会的最后一天，大会的代表和仰光市附近的工人、农民以及各界爱好和平的人民，举行了保卫和平的示威游行。按照缅甸人民的习惯，在各城、各县举行群众集会的时候，可以向当地居民募集饭包（用芭蕉叶子包着饭菜）；那一天，和平委员会从仰光市民那里募集来的饭包，超过了游行示威者的人数；人民这样直接和间接地支持着和平运动，越来越多的人体验到：“和平还是战争？”这个问题密切地关连着自己的生活。
    “目前从大商人一直到只能勉强度日的穷人，他们的营业和他们的生活都感到困难。物价稍有上涨，而收入却没有增加。”吴拉说：“如果说有些大商人是因为不相信世界和平才遭受了损失，我相信是不会错的。因为有的人听信了帝国主义者的战争宣传，囤积货物，贪图暴利；但是战争并没有爆发，人民的购买力也不能提高，货物销不出去，资金周转不灵，银行又在催还借款，有的就破产了。如果他们相信和平，经营正当的业务，也许不会这样。”他提到了莫斯科国际经济会议，他说：“这次的会议也使缅甸的工商界大大觉悟起来了，把眼光放远了。他们正在准备和苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家沟通贸易关系，他们正在展望着和平的、美好的国际贸易的前途。”
    在缅甸人民的文化生活里也增长着和平的内容。新出现的很多年青的文学工作者，在他们的作品里颂扬着和平；美术工作者在描绘和平；音乐工作者在歌唱和平；当“泼水节”（缅甸人民的节日）到来的时候，人民集会庆祝，到处荡漾着和平的歌声，跳跃着和平的舞蹈，队伍里面游动着象征人类崇高愿望的和平鸽。吴拉说：“缅甸文化艺术工作者从事创作，不是为了金钱，所以他们的生活是困难的，吃的和穿的都常常不够，但是他们为了和平是能够忍受的。”
    吴拉自己是作家、新闻工作者和出版家，同时从事于和平运动。他是缅甸人民日报和人民杂志的编辑，是上缅甸的报纸工作者协会主席和作家协会副主席，是缅甸保卫世界和平委员会上缅甸特别委员。吴拉拿出了一张最近的缅甸人民日报，那上面登载着关于全缅甸保卫世界和平大会的社论，登载着关于日本工人“五一”大罢工、埃及人民反帝国主义斗争和美帝国主义进行细菌战等新闻，他兴奋地说：“在缅甸，这是唯一的一家登载北京广播新闻的报纸。在仰光，有些中国的青年学生在为我们推销报纸。据我所知道的，北京还有我们的五家订户呢。”吴拉是缅甸人民和平运动的发起人之一。在斯德哥尔摩宣言发表以后，吴拉和他的夫人——“红色中国的挑战”的缅甸文译者——以及其他文化工作者和学生们，曾经每天在曼德勒城挨家挨户征集签名，到晚上就在各区召开群众会，宣传和平。缅甸的和平拥护者就是这样日夜地为了和平在工作着。             （杨兆麟）
