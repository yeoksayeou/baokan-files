    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Under your care and leadership, the national physical education movement has vigorously developed for more than two years. Based on this, the inaugural meeting of the All-China Sports Federation opened in Beijing on June 20th. The conference lasted for five days, determined the future direction and tasks of the sports movement, adopted the constitution, and elected the leadership. Today, it successfully concluded. We will certainly follow your instruction to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique," and, together with the people of the whole country, work even harder and actively strive for the popularization and regularization of national physical education, so that sports can play a greater role in promoting people's health and strengthening national defense and production.
    We respectfully wish you good health!
    Inaugural Meeting of the All-China Sports Federation
    June 24, 1952
