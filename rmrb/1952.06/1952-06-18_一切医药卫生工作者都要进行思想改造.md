A brief commentary

    All Medical and Health Workers Must Undergo Ideological Remolding
    Our country's medical and health work has achieved great success. Numerous exemplary deeds of saving lives and healing the wounded, as well as heroic figures, continue to emerge on the health front. However, even today, a considerable number of medical and health workers still treat their glorious mission with an irresponsible, even criminal, attitude, leading to a constant stream of medical accidents. The reader's letters published in this newspaper today provide several realistic examples of this problem.
    Why does such a terrible phenomenon of refusing to save lives still exist among medical and health personnel in New China? This is because some medical and health personnel still harbor a rather strong bourgeois ideology. They have either received direct bourgeois education or have been influenced by bourgeois thought, to the extent that their solidified, purely technical, economic, and employment-based viewpoints have not yet been completely overcome and corrected.
    In order to thoroughly correct this seriously irresponsible medical style, a deep ideological remolding movement must be launched among all medical and health workers, mobilizing them to conduct criticism and self-criticism based on ideological awareness, systematically criticize bourgeois ideology, and eliminate that irresponsible style. We believe that only when medical and health workers truly establish a viewpoint of serving the people can they realize the glorious mission indicated by Chairman Mao: "Heal the wounded, rescue the dying, and promote revolutionary humanitarianism."

    一切医药卫生工作者都要进行思想改造
    我国人民的医药卫生工作，是有巨大的成绩的。许多救死扶伤的模范事迹和英雄人物，不断地在卫生战线上涌现出来。但是，直到今天，还有相当一部分医药卫生工作者，以毫不负责的甚至是罪恶的态度，对待自己的光荣的任务，以致医疗事故层出不穷。本报今天发表的关于这个问题的读者来信，提供了若干现实的例证。
    为什么在新中国的医药卫生工作人员中，还存在着这种见死不救的恶劣现象呢？这是因为，某些医药卫生人员还存在着相当浓厚的资产阶级思想。他们或者受了资产阶级直接的教育，或者受了资产阶级思想的影响，以致他们的凝固的单纯技术观点、经济观点和雇佣观点，直到现在还没有彻底克服和纠正。
    为了彻底纠正这种严重的不负责任的医疗作风，必须在一切医药卫生工作者中开展一个深入的思想改造运动，发动他们在思想自觉的基础上，开展批评和自我批评，系统地批判资产阶级思想，清除那种不负责任的作风。我们相信，医务卫生工作者只有真正树立了为人民服务的观点，才能够实现毛主席所指示的“救死扶伤，发扬革命人道主义”的光荣任务。
