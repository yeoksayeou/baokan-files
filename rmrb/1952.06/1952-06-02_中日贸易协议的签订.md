    Signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement

    Following the conclusion of the International Economic Conference in Moscow, the Chinese delegation attending the conference signed trade agreements with economic representatives from countries including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ceylon, Indonesia, Pakistan, Finland, and Italy. The total import and export value specified in these agreements amounted to over US$223 million. Now, Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, has signed the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in Beijing, the capital of our country, with Japanese representatives attending the International Economic Conference, including Takayoshi Kora, Koashi Kei of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, and Miyakoshi Kisuke, Director-General of the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade. The total import and export value specified in this agreement amounts to £60 million. This is another testament to our consistent advocacy for establishing peaceful international trade relations with the people of all countries based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance, and cooperation.

    The signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement aligns with the common aspirations of the peace-loving people of China and Japan. The Chinese people are willing to see Japan healthily develop its peaceful economy, normally restore and develop trade relations between China and Japan, enable the Japanese people to avoid the disasters caused by the resurgence of militaristic aggression, and improve the living conditions of the Japanese people. The Japanese people, possessing peaceful aspirations and national self-esteem, have long been unable to endure the plight of Japanese industry and commerce and the precarious living conditions of the Japanese people.

    Where do the serious disasters facing Japanese industry and commerce and the hardships in the lives of the Japanese people come from? This is because the current Japanese economy is increasingly being forced onto the path of rearmament and war preparation, turning the Japanese economy into an appendage of the American economy. In recent years, the Japanese people have been burdened with a massive war budget. This year, Japan's military budget accounts for approximately one-fifth of the gross national income. Kawakita Teiichi, Manager of the Industrial Bank of Japan, stated in the Japanese magazine "Economist" published on January 1st of this year: "It is entirely predictable that the fiscal scale of 850 billion yen for the fiscal year 1952 will exert considerable pressure on the national economy." Under such pressure, Japan's peaceful industries cannot but decline. According to materials published in the same magazine on February 1st, from last spring to November, 260 Japanese textile companies and firms have already gone bankrupt. Economic ties between Japan and China and other major regions of Asia have been forcibly severed, depriving Japanese industry and commerce of legitimate sources of raw materials and foreign markets. In 1950, Japan's foreign trade volume was only one-third of the average foreign trade volume from 1934 to 1936. This inevitably caused Japan's peaceful industries to fall completely into a state of depression, and inevitably lowered the living standards of the Japanese working people to the starvation line. This situation, in turn, has further shrunk the Japanese domestic market and exacerbated the economic crisis.

    To improve the current economic situation in Japan and the living conditions of the Japanese people, the economic relations between Japan and major regions of Asia must first be restored. The signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement should serve as a starting point for restoring this normal relationship, and the restoration and development of this normal trade relationship requires continued joint efforts from the people of China and Japan.

    The restoration and development of normal trade relations between China and Japan is highly possible. Japanese industry needs Chinese coal, salt, soybeans, oilseed raw materials, and other products, while China can accommodate Japanese industrial machinery, materials, raw materials, semi-finished products, and industrial goods. In 1950, trade between China and Japan had somewhat recovered, but due to restrictions imposed by the Japanese government under American influence, the once-recovering Sino-Japanese trade relations came to a halt, with the result that Japanese industry could not obtain cheaper materials from China and had to purchase them from the United States at high prices. The United States is doing its utmost to control Japan, forcing Japan to engage in arms production while stifling Japan's peaceful industries, and completely restricting Japan's normal foreign trade relations. This unreasonable and unfree situation must be changed, and it is only natural that the Japanese people cannot tolerate the overbearing control of the United States. The demands of the Japanese people and Japanese business circles for the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade cannot but arouse the sympathy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are willing to establish and develop economic relations with all countries on the basis of peace, friendship, equality, and mutual benefit; and the desire for the restoration and development of Sino-Japanese trade relations has now been manifested through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    The Chinese people are willing to see the restoration of trade relations between the people of China and Japan, starting with this agreement, and are willing to see the trade between the two peoples continue to develop further.

### 中日贸易协议的签订

    中日贸易协议的签订
    在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议闭会以后，我国出席国际经济会议的代表团曾先后与英国、法国、比利时、荷兰、瑞士、锡兰、印尼、巴基斯坦、芬兰、意大利等国经济界代表签订了贸易协议。各项协议中规定的进出口总额共值美金二亿二千三百余万元。现在我国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸又与日本出席国际经济会议代表高良富、日本的中日贸易促进会代表帆足计、中日贸易促进议员联盟理事长宫腰喜助等在我国首都北京签订了中日贸易协议。此项协议中规定的进出口总额共值六千万英镑。这是我国人民和各国人民之间，在平等互利、互助合作的原则下，建立和平的国际贸易关系的一贯主张的又一证明。
    中日贸易协议的签订是符合于爱好和平的我国人民和日本人民的共同愿望的。我国人民愿意看到日本能够健全地发展自己的和平经济，能够正常地恢复和发展中日两国间的贸易关系，使日本人民能够避免军国主义再起侵略所造成的灾害，使日本人民的生活条件能够得到改善。具有和平愿望与民族自尊心的日本人民，久已不能忍受日本工商业的痛苦境遇和日本人民生活的危困状况了。
    日本工商业所面临的严重灾难和日本人民生活的困苦是从何而来的呢？这是因为目前的日本经济正日益被迫走上重新武装和备战的道路，使日本经济变成了美国经济的附庸的缘故。近几年来，在日本人民身上负担着庞大的战争预算。今年日本的军事预算约占国民总收入的五分之一。日本兴业银行经理川北祯一在今年一月一日出版的日本“经济学人”杂志上说：“一九五二年度的八千五百亿财政规模，将给予国民经济以相当压力是完全可以预测的。”在这样的压力之下，日本的和平工业就不能不日趋萧条了。据同一杂志二月一日刊载的材料，从去年春季到十一月间，日本纺织公司和商号倒闭的已达二百六十家。日本与我国及亚洲主要地区的经济联系更被强迫切断了，使日本工商业失掉了正当的原料来源和国外市场。一九五○年日本的对外贸易额，只等于一九三四年至一九三六年平均对外贸易额的三分之一。这就不可避免地使日本的和平工商业完全陷于萧条状态，使日本劳动人民的生活水平不可避免地降低到饥饿线上了。这种情况反转过来又使日本的国内市场更加萎缩，经济危机愈加严重。
    改善目前日本的经济情况和日本人民的生活状况，首先应该使日本与亚洲主要地区的经济关系恢复起来。现在中日贸易协议的签订应该成为恢复这种正常关系的一个开端，而这种正常的贸易关系的恢复与发展，还需要中日两国人民继续共同努力。
    中日两国正常的贸易关系的恢复与发展是有很大可能的。日本工业需要中国的煤、盐、大豆、油脂原料及其他产品，中国也能容纳日本的工业机器、材料、原料、半制品及工业品。一九五○年中日两国的贸易也曾有某种程度的恢复，但因日本政府受了美国的限制，又使一度开始恢复的中日贸易关系陷于停顿，以致日本工业不能得到中国较便宜的物资而必须以高价向美国购买。美国极力控制日本，强迫日本进行军火生产，而扼杀日本的和平工业，完全限制了日本对外的正常贸易关系。这种不合理的不自由的状况是必须加以改变的，日本人民不能忍受美国的蛮横控制是极当然的。日本人民和日本工商界人士要求恢复中日贸易的呼声，不能不引起我国人民的同情。我国人民对于各国的经济关系，都愿意在和平友好、平等互利的基础上加以建立和发展；对于中日贸易关系的恢复与发展的愿望，现在则已经由中日贸易协议的签订而表现出来了。
    我国人民愿意看到以这个协议为开始的中日两国人民间贸易关系的恢复，愿意看到两国人民间的贸易能继续有进一步的发展。
