    "Pravda" Paris Correspondent Reports
    Increase in Membership of the French Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th] According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 4th, "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Zhukov, reports: French patriots are uniting their ranks more closely and resolutely and forcefully rebuffing the anti-peace and anti-people fascist conspiracies of the Pinay government.

    Zhukov said: After the failure of the French authorities' conspiracy to frame the French Communist Party and various democratic groups, they are plotting new conspiracies. Now, the reactionary newspapers are clamoring loudly, on the one hand, threatening to use repressive measures against the working class, and on the other hand, advising them "not to easily believe other people's propaganda," but to listen to the instructions of the right-wing Socialist Party, and should only strive for economic demands and should not interfere with politics.

    Zhukov pointed out: However, these measures are not producing any results. It is worth noting that the sales of "l'Humanité" have greatly increased in the past few days. Workers are actively promoting their own newspaper. More and more people are voluntarily donating to this newspaper of the working class. But, of greatest significance is that right now, when the fascist police rule in France is becoming more and more frantic, when reactionary newspapers are clamoring that the Communist Party may be declared illegal, and when Communist Party Secretary Duclos is in prison, the number of people joining the Party is constantly increasing throughout the country. Zhukov stressed that as long as one clearly recognizes the oppressive suffocating atmosphere in France under the fascist police rule, it is not difficult to imagine what it means for people to join the Communist Party now.

    Zhukov finally wrote: General Ridgway, the butcher who massacred the Korean people, dreamed of making a career in Europe to win more blood-stained rewards, boasted that he came to France to prepare to extinguish communism with the help of God. The development of the situation shows that the American imperialists and their agents in Western Europe do not only have the task of an anti-communist crusade, they have a broader plan to suppress all democratic forces in Western Europe. The recent actions of the French reactionaries in Paris are only the first step in realizing this plan. However, just like the fascist adventurers of the past, they overestimated their chances of success and underestimated the resistance of the working class.

    “真理报”驻巴黎记者报道
    法共党员人数增加
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“真理报”驻巴黎记者朱可夫报道：法国爱国者正在更加紧密地团结自己的队伍，坚决有力地反击比内政府反和平、反人民的法西斯阴谋。
    朱可夫说：法国当局在其诬陷法国共产党和各民主团体的阴谋失败以后，又在策划新的阴谋。现在，反动报纸正在大肆叫嚣，一面恫吓着要用镇压手段对付工人阶级，一面又劝告他们“不要轻信别人的宣传”，而要听从右翼社会党的指示，只应该争取经济要求，而不应该过问政治。
    朱可夫指出：可是，这些措施产生不了什么作用。值得注意的是：“人道报”这几天来销路已经大大增加。工人们都积极推销他们自己的报纸。越来越多的人自动捐款给这家工人阶级的报纸。但是，有最重大的意义的是：就在现在，正当法国的法西斯警察统治愈来愈疯狂，正当反动报纸在叫嚣着可能宣布共产党非法，而共产党书记杜克洛又身系狱中的时候，全国各地入党的人数却在不断增加。朱可夫着重指出：只要清楚地认识到法国当前在法西斯警察统治下迫人的窒息气氛，就不难想见，人民现在参加共产党具有怎样的意义。
    朱可夫最后写道：屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手李奇微将军梦想在欧洲干一番事业以博取更多沾满血腥的奖赏，便夸下海口，说他到法国来准备在上帝的帮助下扑灭共产主义。形势的发展表明：美帝国主义者和他们在西欧的代理人并不是仅有反共十字军这样一个任务，他们有着更广泛的镇压西欧一切民主力量的计划。法国反动派最近在巴黎的所作所为，只不过是实现这计划的第一步罢了。然而，正如历来的法西斯冒险者一样，他们过高估计了他们成功的可能，过低估计了工人阶级的抵抗力量。
