Heroic Reconnaissance Soldiers
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jie

On the Korean front lines, there is a crystal-clear small river. Reconnaissance soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army often cross this river to capture prisoners on the enemy's positions who can provide intelligence. They also frequently use tactics such as surprise attacks, ambushes, and counter-ambushes to eliminate small groups of enemies.

One cold night, reconnaissance platoon leader Li Zongming and several reconnaissance soldiers disguised themselves to match the color of the snowy ground. They waded across the frozen river and followed a familiar path toward the enemy's position. When the moon came out, they绕道 (raodao, detoured) to the dark side of the hillside, avoiding the eyes of the enemy sentries as they crawled forward. Not far away, an enemy patrol was approaching. Li Zongming decided to eliminate this patrol. They were at the foot of a hillside, and the enemy's machine gun position was on top of the hill, about forty meters away. The reconnaissance soldiers laid a net to eliminate the enemy right under the enemy's nose. When the enemy patrol entered this net, they were caught in a surprise attack from several directions. Most of the patrol soldiers were hit by bullets flying from all sides. One enemy soldier, not yet understanding what was happening, was captured alive by two reconnaissance soldiers who jumped up from the snow. The enemy on the hillside blindly fired their machine guns in panic. The reconnaissance soldiers, however, remained calm under the machine gun fire, carrying the captured weapons and prisoner back to their own position.

The enemy, made uneasy by the reconnaissance soldiers, tried many ways to guard against the sudden attacks of our army's reconnaissance soldiers. Once, the enemy also sent thirteen reconnaissance soldiers wearing camouflage to ambush our reconnaissance soldiers. These enemy soldiers walked cautiously, stopping at almost every slight sound. As they approached the area they were preparing to ambush, eleven enemy soldiers went into a small house, while only two enemy soldiers continued to search forward. These two enemy soldiers carefully observed the scenery on both sides of the road, and when they felt there was nothing suspicious, they walked forward with peace of mind. Suddenly, with the sound of a rifle being cocked, one enemy soldier was pressed to the ground and his head was tightly covered; the other enemy soldier was shot down by a sudden burst of fire as he tried to escape. This counter-ambush battle was fought by the Volunteer Army's reconnaissance soldiers Kang Borong, Yin Keming, and Xie Songbo. When Kang Borong and the others returned to their position with the prisoner whose head was covered, and learned that this prisoner was a "seasoned reconnaissance soldier" from the U.S. 24th Division, the reconnaissance soldiers couldn't help but laugh heartily.

Later, the enemy retreated into their fortifications before dark. The reconnaissance soldiers then tried to capture prisoners during the day. In early April, the mountains were already green. In the morning, several Korean villagers were rushing to harvest the corn left over from last winter in the fields in front of the Volunteer Army's position. At this time, three enemies sneaked over, carefully observing every mound in the field as they walked, looking for any concealed Volunteer Army reconnaissance soldiers. They had only gone halfway when a grenade suddenly landed beside them and exploded. Two enemy soldiers were killed on the spot, and the remaining one was captured by the reconnaissance soldiers who suddenly emerged from the ridges between the fields. This enemy soldier said to the reconnaissance soldiers with great dismay: "We originally wanted to capture two villagers to investigate the situation of the Volunteer Army, but we never expected that I myself would become your prisoner."

The reconnaissance soldiers active on the front lines and behind enemy lines are not only good eyes and ears for the commanders, but also have fought many small annihilation battles, killing and wounding many enemies. A reconnaissance platoon led by Li Zongming had already annihilated one hundred and four enemies. Li Zongming was awarded a first-class merit for this. Now the mountains and fields are full of lush trees, which is even more conducive to the activities of the reconnaissance soldiers. They are currently formulating new plans to achieve meritorious service on the position.

    神勇的侦察兵
    新华社记者  张结
    在朝鲜前线某地有一条晶莹的小河。志愿军某部的侦察兵们常常越过这条小河，到敌人阵地上捕捉提供情报的俘虏。他们还常常用偷袭、伏击、反伏击等等战法消灭小股敌人。
    一个寒冷的夜里，侦察班长李宗明和几个侦察兵伪装得和雪地的颜色一样，涉过冰冻的小河，沿着早已摸熟了的道路走向敌阵。月亮出来了，他们就绕到山坡的阴暗面，避开敌人哨兵的眼睛向前爬去。不远处有敌人的一个巡逻班走来了，李宗明就决定歼灭这一班敌人。这时他们正在一个山坡底下，山坡上就是敌人的机枪阵地，两者相距约四十公尺。侦察兵们就在这块敌人鼻子底下的地方布下了歼敌的罗网。当敌人巡逻班一进入这个罗网，就遭到意外的突然袭击，大部巡逻兵吃到了从几面飞来的枪弹。有一个敌人还没有弄清是怎么一回事，就被从雪地上猛跳起来的两个侦察兵活捉了，山坡上的敌人张慌地用机枪盲目扫射。侦察兵们却在机枪的弹道底下，带着缴获的枪枝和俘虏泰然走回自己的阵地。
    被侦察兵们弄得惶惶不安的敌人，曾想了许多办法来防范我军侦察兵的突然袭击。有一次，敌人也派了十三个披着伪装衣的侦察兵来伏击我们的侦察兵。这些敌兵战战兢兢地走着，几乎一个细小的声响都使他们悚然止步。当他们走近他们预备伏击的地区时，有十一个敌兵走进一间小屋子去了，只有两个敌兵继续向前搜索。这两个敌兵仔细观察着道路两旁的景物，觉得没有一点可疑时才放心地向前走去。忽然，随着一下拉枪拴的声音，一个敌人已被按倒在地上，头被紧紧地蒙住；另一个敌人刚想逃跑，就被突发的子弹打倒了。这个反伏击的战斗，是志愿军的侦察员亢伯荣、尹克明和谢松伯三人打的。当亢伯荣他们带着这个被蒙住头的俘虏回到自己的阵地上，并且知道这个俘虏是美军二十四师一个“老练的侦察兵”时，侦察兵们都不禁哈哈大笑起来。
    后来敌人天不黑就龟缩进工事里。侦察兵们就想法在白天捕捉俘虏。四月初，山上已是一片青绿。早晨有几个朝鲜老乡在志愿军阵地前的田地里抢收去冬留下的苞谷。这时，有三个敌人偷偷地走过来，他们一面走一面仔细地观察着田野上的每一个土堆，看看是否埋伏着志愿军的侦察兵。他们刚走到半路，忽然飞来的一颗手榴弹落在他们身旁炸响了，两个敌人当场被炸死，留下的一个被从田垄间突然冒出来的侦察兵们捉住了。这个敌人十分懊丧地对侦察兵说：“我们原想来抓两个老乡去调查志愿军的情况，却想不到我自己反当了你们的俘虏。”
    活跃在前线和敌后的侦察兵们，不但是指挥员很好的耳目，而且打了许多次小歼灭战，杀伤了许多敌人。李宗明带领的一个侦察班，就已经歼灭了一百零四个敌人。李宗明因此荣立了一等功。现在山岭田野间已经长满了枝叶茂盛的树丛，这是更加有利于侦察兵们的活动的，他们正在阵地上拟订他们新的立功计划。
