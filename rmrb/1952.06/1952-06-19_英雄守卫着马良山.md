    On the eve of the second anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, this reporter visited Ma Liang Mountain, which stands tall on the western front, and interviewed the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers fighting on this ridge.

    When Van Fleet launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive" last September, the American generals clamored to seize Ma Liang Mountain, this "strategic high ground," but the reality of the war ruthlessly shattered their arrogant attempt. In the past nine months, the enemy forces attacking Ma Liang Mountain have been replaced four times: first the British accomplice army's 29th Brigade, which was crippled and replaced by the British accomplice army's 28th Brigade, which was also battered and replaced by the U.S. invading army's 3rd Division, and in April this year, the Syngman Rhee puppet army's 1st Division was brought in. The U.S. and British invading forces have lost more than 6,000 officers and soldiers on this mountain, but their goal of invading - Ma Liang Mountain - can still only be seen in their telescopes.

    Artillery fire roars day and night on Ma Liang Mountain, and the natural appearance of the ridge has changed: the forests on the mountain have long been uprooted and burned to ashes; the spire on the main peak has also been flattened by artillery fire, becoming a bare, bald head. Every crater and every stone on the top of the mountain is engraved with the victorious achievements of the heroic Volunteer Army soldiers.

    On this heroic mountain ridge, there is a crater-filled 216.8 high ground, which is where the "Ma Liang Mountain Blocking Hero Company" annihilated more than 700 enemies. On October 5th last year, heroic company commander Yan Zhigang led twenty-odd soldiers, with great courage and skillful tactics, to repel the attack of more than four hundred enemies, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At that time, the enemy had occupied the peak, and the three large bunkers guarded by Yan Zhigang and his men were attacked fiercely by the enemy. Incendiary grenades exploded at the entrance of the bunkers, and the flames burned Yan Zhigang's and the soldiers' clothes. They put out the fire while firing fiercely, causing waves of charging enemies to fall down. Later, Yan Zhigang led the soldiers to counterattack the peak and drove the enemy down the mountain.

    On Ma Liang Mountain, there is a section of trench where fierce fighting took place, which is where combat heroes Zhang Hao, Pan Shan, Chen Zhongxing and their comrades-in-arms established their military exploits and was praised as the "Three-Sided Iron Wall". On October 6th last year, the heroes repelled the fierce attack of nearly a thousand enemies: Chen Zhongxing used an anti-tank mine to kill sixteen enemy soldiers; the 60-cannon squad leader Pan Shan finished his shells and picked up a submachine gun to shoot at the enemy; combat hero Zhang Hao continuously threw grenades at the enemy; the signalman also rushed around on the position, delivering handfuls of grenades with the caps removed and submachine gun magazines full of bullets to the soldiers. Every part of this trench spewed out the flames of revenge on the enemy, and all that fell in front of it were piles of enemy corpses, numbering more than five hundred.

    After many fierce battles for Ma Liang Mountain and its peaks, our army temporarily and proactively withdrew from this ridge. However, when the British accomplice army's 29th Brigade climbed the peaks of Ma Liang Mountain, they were already exhausted from being battered, and they paid a heavy price of 2,600 casualties. The British accomplice army had to transfer the 28th Brigade to replace the 29th Brigade.

    But the British 28th Brigade suffered equally heavy blows on Ma Liang Mountain. The Scottish Border Regiment of this brigade built fortifications on Ma Liang Mountain for a month, with bunkers standing tall on the mountain, filled with landmines, illuminating mines, and dense layers of barbed wire. The heroic Volunteer Army soldiers, however, recaptured all the peaks of Ma Liang Mountain in less than an hour of counterattack, and the Scottish Border Regiment was almost completely annihilated.

    This counterattack was a masterpiece of the ever-stronger Chinese People's Volunteer Army infantry and artillery. At 3:00 p.m. on November 4th, the order to counterattack Ma Liang Mountain was simultaneously transmitted to the infantry and artillery units, and the silent front suddenly boiled. The artillerymen fiercely bombarded the peaks of Ma Liang Mountain, the illuminating mines on the enemy's forward positions were detonated, and the enemy's bunkers were blasted down one after another. Grass bags, wood, and barbed wire were blown into the air. When the infantry assault team launched a brave charge, all the artillery fire was extended and bombarded together, building a wall of fire behind the enemy's position, blocking the fleeing enemy and the enemy coming to reinforce. The heroes who counterattacked the 216.8 high ground occupied the position in just eighteen minutes. Then the victory signals of the counterattack were successively raised on the peaks of Ma Liang Mountain.

    The British accomplice army's 28th Brigade was annihilated with 2,700 people in this battle. The U.S. invading army had to transfer its 3rd Division to take over. But the U.S. 3rd Division was also met with a strong blow from the Volunteer Army forces.

    After Ma Liang Mountain returned to the hands of the Volunteer Army, the heroes built a new Ma Liang Mountain as strong as steel with tenacious will. The huge sound of the heavy shells fired by the enemy on the top of the mountain, only passed into the fortifications as a muffled low rumble. When the enemy comes to attack this ridge, as long as the sentry reports, every fortification on the ridge has grenades and machine guns waiting for them.

    On the snowy night of January 9th this year, a battalion of enemies wearing white clothes sneaked into Ma Liang Mountain. At that time, the mountain was silent, as if no one was guarding it. But when the enemy approached to more than thirty meters from the position, suddenly a shot rang out, and hail-like grenades, crisscrossing machine gun bullets, and whistling small cannon shells, like having eyes, fiercely attacked the enemy, killing and wounding them, and rolling down the mountain. The enemy suffered such a disastrous defeat every time they attacked this ridge.

    The heroes guarding Ma Liang Mountain not only struck the enemy on the land, they also severely punished the U.S. air bandits, shooting down or damaging thirteen enemy planes in April this year alone.

    After the U.S. invading army's 3rd Division withdrew from Ma Liang Mountain with wounds, the Rhee puppet army's 1st Division was transferred there to die in April this year. Summer has dyed the mountains of Korea into a lush green, but Ma Liang Mountain still stands proudly in front of the enemy with its distinctive black and yellow bald top. The Volunteer Army heroes who have fought on this ridge for nine months are forever radiating the light of victory.

    英雄守卫着马良山
    新华社记者  王玉章
    在抗美战争第二周年纪念日即将来临的时候，记者到了屹立在西部战线上的马良山，访问了战斗在这座山岭上的英雄的志愿军战士们。
    去年九月底范佛里特发动所谓“秋季攻势”的时候，美国将军们就叫嚣着要攻下马良山这座“战略山头”，但战争的实际却严酷地粉碎了他们的狂妄企图。九个多月来，攻击马良山的敌军已经更换了四次：先是英国帮凶军第二十九旅，这个旅被打残废了，换上英国帮凶军第二十八旅，这个旅又被打得焦头烂额，就又换上美国侵略军第三师，今年四月间又换了李承晚伪军第一师。美、英侵略军已在这座山上损失了六千多名官兵，但他们妄图侵占的目标——马良山，却仍然只能在他们的望远镜里看到。
    炮火日夜地在马良山上轰鸣着，山岭的自然面貌已经改变了：山上的丛林早已被连根拔起，烧成灰烬；主峰上的尖顶也被炮火削平，成为光溜溜的秃头。在山顶上的每一个弹坑，每一块石头，都镌刻着志愿军英雄们的胜利业绩。
    在这座英雄山岭上，有个弹坑累累的二一六点八高地，那就是“马良山阻击英雄连”先后歼敌七百余人的地方。在去年十月五日，英雄连长阎志刚率领二十几个战士，以高度勇气和巧妙战术迎击四百多个敌人的进攻，使敌人遭受惨重的伤亡。当时敌人已侵占了山峰，阎志刚他们据守的三个大地堡受到敌人的猛袭，燃烧手榴弹炸在地堡门口，火焰烧着了阎志刚和战士们的衣服。他们一边扑火一边猛烈射击，使冲锋过来的敌人一批又一批地倒下去。后来阎志刚率领战士们反扑到山峰上，把敌人打下山去。
    在马良山上有一段勇猛地战斗过的堑壕，这就是被赞为“三面铁墙”的战斗英雄张豪、潘山、陈忠兴和他们的战友们立下战功的地方。去年十月六日，英雄们迎击近千个敌人的猛烈进攻：陈忠兴用一颗反坦克雷炸死了十六个敌兵；六零炮班班长潘山打完了炮弹又拿起冲锋枪来射击敌人；战斗英雄张豪连续向敌人猛掷手榴弹；通讯员、司号员也奔忙在阵地上，将一大把一大把揭开盖子的手榴弹和压满子弹的冲锋枪梭子输送到战士们面前。这条堑壕没有一处不向敌人喷吐复仇的火焰，打得倒在前面的尽是一堆堆敌人的尸体，数目足有五百多具。
    马良山诸峰经过了许多次激烈的争夺战，我军暂时主动撤离这座山岭。但英国帮凶军第二十九旅爬山马良山诸峰时，已被打得疲惫不堪了，他们足足付出了死伤二千六百人的惨重代价。英国帮凶军只好把二十八旅调来替换二十九旅。
    但英军二十八旅在马良山上同样遭受到惨重的打击。该旅苏格兰边防团在马良山上修了一个月的工事，山上碉堡林立、布满了地雷、照明雷和密密层层的铁丝网。志愿军英雄们却在不到一小时的反击战斗中，就把马良山诸峰全部夺了回来，苏格兰边防团几乎全部被歼。
    这次反击战是愈战愈强的中国人民志愿军步兵和炮兵共同的杰作。十一月四日下午三点钟，反击马良山的命令同时传到了步兵和炮兵部队，沉寂的前线突然沸腾起来了。炮兵们向着马良山诸峰猛烈轰击，敌人阵地前沿的照明雷被炸响了，敌人的地堡一个又一个地被打塌了。草包、木头、铁丝网被掀到半空。当步兵突击队发起勇猛的冲锋后，所有的炮火一齐延伸轰击，在敌人阵地的后面筑成了一道火墙，挡住了溃逃的敌人和前来增援的敌人。反击二一六点八高地的英雄们仅在十八分钟时间内就占领了阵地。接着马良山诸峰都先后升起了反击胜利的信号。
    英国帮凶军第二十八旅在这次战斗中被歼二千七百人。美国侵略军又不得不调它的第三师来接替。但是美三师同样遭到了志愿军部队的坚强打击。
    马良山回到志愿军的手中以后，英雄们以坚韧的意志修建了一座新的坚如钢铁的马良山。敌人打在山顶上的重炮弹，爆炸的巨响传到工事里面只是一阵阵沉闷的低微的哄响。敌人来向这座山岭进攻，只消哨兵一声报告，遍及山岭的每一个工事，都有手榴弹和机关枪在等着他们。
    今年一月九日下雪的晚上，一个营敌人披着白衣偷袭马良山。当时满山一片寂静，好像没有人在守卫。但当敌人接近到离阵地三十多公尺的时候，忽然一声枪响，冰雹一样多的手榴弹、交错射出的机关枪弹和飞啸的小炮弹，就像长着眼睛一样地猛击着敌人，杀得敌人死伤枕藉，滚下山去。敌人每次向这座山岭进攻，都遭到了这样的惨败。
    守卫在马良山上的英雄们不仅打击了陆地上的敌人，他们还严惩了美国空中强盗，仅在今年四月份就击落击伤了十三架敌机。
    美国侵略军第三师带着创伤从马良山前撤走后，今年四月间李伪军第一师又被调到那里去送死。夏天已把朝鲜的群山染成一片翠绿，马良山却仍以它那特有的黑黄色的秃顶傲然屹立在敌人面前。九个月来战斗在这座山岭上的志愿军英雄们，永远放射着胜利的光芒。
