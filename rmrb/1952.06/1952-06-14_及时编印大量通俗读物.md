A Brief Comment on Cultural Life

    Promptly Publish a Large Number of Popular Readers
    Wang Mian’s "Cultural Great March," published in this newspaper yesterday, is a vivid example of how literacy can be quickly achieved. The successful experience of Zhang Laifu, a People's Liberation Army soldier who studied in the accelerated literacy experimental class, can dispel all doubts about the accelerated literacy method, alleviate the ideological concerns of workers, peasants, and soldiers about learning culture, and encourage their confidence in "cultural emancipation."

    Before the advent of the accelerated literacy method, Zhang Laifu set a "three-year plan" to learn one thousand characters a year, but "after studying for half a year, I only recognized one or two hundred characters, couldn't read books, couldn't write manuscripts, and forgot almost everything when the central task came." From 1949 to July of this year, "I only knew three hundred and twenty characters." But after studying in the accelerated literacy experimental class for four weeks, he could also read Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," only twenty-four characters were unknown to him, no wonder he was "so happy that he jumped up." Accelerated literacy experimental classes in various places have already provided many examples of this kind. This seems to be an incomprehensible "miracle," but it is completely understandable if you take a close look at "Cultural Great March." The main characteristics of the accelerated literacy method are that it starts from the urgent demands of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the new China to learn culture, gives full play to the advantages of adults' rich life experience, comprehension, and association, and uses phonetic symbols as a tool for entry, while implementing the spirit of learning and using consistently throughout the entire teaching process. The characteristics of the accelerated literacy method and its astonishing effects are powerfully demonstrated in the article "Cultural Great March." "Cultural Great March" is a good model for accelerated literacy teaching, which uses storytelling to specifically and vividly describe the entire teaching process of the accelerated literacy method and the rapid literacy of the students.

    Of course, troops, factories, and rural areas have different specific situations, such as the troops are more concentrated, and the farmers are more dispersed. In terms of learning time, teaching organization, and teaching leadership, factories and rural areas must flexibly apply the experience of the troops according to their actual situation and learning conditions, and should not mechanically copy them. At present, some places are promoting the accelerated literacy method among the peasant masses, but rigidly adopting the team organization and large class formats used in the troops, which affects agricultural production. These phenomena should be prevented. But the accelerated literacy method itself is equally applicable to workers and peasants, as has been proven by many facts.

    The main problem at present, in addition to mobilizing the masses to universally promote the accelerated literacy method in a planned and step-by-step manner, is to consolidate and improve the literacy achievements that have already been made. An effective method is to read and apply them frequently. This puts forward a major and urgent task for the cultural and educational circles: to promptly compile and publish a large number of popular readers that suit the tastes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially popular literary readers and interesting popular science readers. With the gradual promotion of the accelerated literacy method and the rapid elimination of a large number of illiterates, the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers with preliminary reading abilities will inevitably reach out to the cultural and educational circles for the readers they like to see. In fact, the masses' demand for healthy popular readers is growing louder day by day. The new China's cultural, educational, and publishing circles, which serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers first, must make the greatest efforts to meet the above practical requirements. Therefore, the relevant leading departments should quickly mobilize and organize forces, conduct extensive and in-depth investigation and research work on a regular basis, understand the actual needs of the masses in this regard, and promptly compile and publish a large number of popular readers. At the same time, cultural workers in all aspects, especially literary writers, must deeply recognize the great significance of writing excellent popular readers, and unify popularization and improvement well, and earnestly serve the people. "Cultural Great March" and many other articles on the experimental effectiveness of the accelerated literacy method have given us very clear inspiration, and we cannot delay any longer. We should act quickly!

### 及时编印大量通俗读物

    及时编印大量通俗读物
    本报昨天发表的王勉执笔的“文化大进军”，是识字可以速成的生动例证。人民解放军战士张来福在速成识字实验班学习的成功经验，可以扫清一切对速成识字法的怀疑，解除工农兵对学习文化的各种思想顾虑，鼓舞他们对“文化翻身”的信心。
    张来福在速成识字法未出现以前，订了一年学一千字的“三年计划”，可是“学了半年，认得一二百字，看不了书，写不了稿，中心任务一来，就忘得差不多了。”从一九四九年学到今年七月，“我才认识三百二十个字”。但他在速成识字实验班学习了四个星期，毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，也能读了，只有二十四个字不认识，怪不得他要“高兴得跳起来”。各地速成识字法实验班已经提供了不少这一类的例子。这似乎是不可理解的“奇迹”，但只要你仔细看看“文化大进军”，那是完全可以理解的。速成识字法的主要特点，就是从新中国工农兵对学习文化的迫切要求出发，发挥成年人生活经验丰富、理解力和联想力强的优点，并利用注音符号作为入门的工具，而在整个教学过程中贯彻着学用一致的突击精神。速成识字法的这一特点及其所获得的惊人效果，在“文化大进军”一文中非常有力地表现出来了。“文化大进军”是一个很好的速成识字教学范本，它用讲故事的方法，把速成识字法的整个教学过程和学员识字速成状况，具体生动地描绘出来。
    当然，部队、工厂、农村，各有不同的具体情况，如部队战士比较集中，农民就比较分散。在学习时间，教学组织和教学领导等方面，工厂和农村必须根据自己的实际情况和学习条件，灵活运用部队的经验，不可机械地硬搬。目前有些地方，在农民群众中推行速成识字法，却生硬地采取部队中的分队编制、上大课等方式，以致影响农业生产。这些现象应该防止。但速成识字法本身同样适用于工人和农民，已经由许多事实证明了。
    当前的主要问题，除有计划、有步骤地动员群众力量普遍推行速成识字法外，就是巩固和提高已经取得的识字成绩，有效的方法则是经常阅读和应用。这就向文化教育界提出了一个重大而迫切的任务：及时编印大量适合工农兵口味的通俗读物，尤其是通俗文艺读物和有趣味的通俗科学读物。跟着速成识字法的逐步推广和大量文盲的迅速扫除，具有初步阅读能力的广大工农兵，必然会伸手向文化教育界要自己喜欢看的读物。实际上，群众要求健康的通俗读物的呼声，已经一天高似一天了。而首先为工农兵服务的新中国文化界、教育界和出版界，就不能不以最大努力来满足上述的实际要求。因此，各有关领导部门应该迅速动员和组织力量，经常进行广泛而深入地调查研究工作，了解群众在这方面的实际需要，及时地编印大量通俗读物。同时各方面的文化工作者，尤其是文艺作家们，必须深刻认识编写优秀通俗读物的重大意义，把普及工作和提高工作很好地统一起来，切实做到为人民服务。“文化大进军”和其他许多关于速成识字法的实验成效的文章，给了我们非常明确的启示，不容大家再拖延了。应该迅速行动起来！
