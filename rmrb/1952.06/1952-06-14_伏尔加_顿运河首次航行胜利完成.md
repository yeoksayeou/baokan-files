Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The recently completed Volga-Don Canal has brought another exciting piece of good news. According to TASS: Following the successful completion of the test voyage that began on the 1st, the first voyage of the Volga-Don Shipping Canal has been victoriously completed. On the evening of the 9th, a Soviet-made motor vessel sailed to the town of Kalach on the Don River and docked. It departed from the city of Krasnoarmeysk on the Volga side. After setting off, it steadily passed through nine locks upstream, and finally passed through four locks and three large reservoirs, successfully sailing downstream to the east bank of the Don River. Due to the triumphant maiden voyage of the canal, ships of eight transport fleets are now sailing on the canal, and the number of ships anchored at the berths of Krasnoarmeysk is constantly increasing. There, people can not only see new ships with the words "Volga-Don Shipping Company" written on them, but also many employees who used to work on the Dnieper, Don, Volga, and Oka rivers. The workers at the berths are busy from morning till night, directing the mooring of cargo ships and serving short-distance cruise ships.

On another section of the canal—the section connecting the Tsimlyansk Reservoir and the lower reaches of the Don River—the test voyage of ships sailing towards each other was also successfully completed. On June 3rd, two diesel ships, towing an 800-ton barge, entered Lock No. 14 from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir. Since the operation of all hydraulic engineering equipment was normal, they smoothly passed through the lock. At the same time, the last lock of the Volga-Don Canal—Lock No. 15—released two diesel ships towing a barge and several other barges, allowing them to sail majestically towards the Tsimlyansk Reservoir. Finally, the two fleets met between Lock No. 14 and Lock No. 15 of the canal. Tens of thousands of construction workers and guests gathered on the shore, applauding and cheering to warmly celebrate another brilliant victory of the Volga-Don Canal.

    伏尔加—顿运河首次航行胜利完成
    【新华社十三日讯】最近完工的伏尔加—顿运河又传来了振奋人心的喜讯。据塔斯社消息：继一日开始的试航工作完满结束之后，伏尔加—顿通航运河的首次航行已经胜利完成，九日晚上一艘苏联制造的摩托船已经开到顿河那一边的卡拉奇镇停泊了。它是由伏尔加河这一边的红军城出发的，启行之后，它安稳地穿过九道水闸溯水而上，最后又通过四道水闸和三个大水库，胜利地下驶到顿河东岸。由于通航运河初航的胜利，现在已有八个运输船队的船只在通航运河上行驶，在红军城的泊船处碇泊的船只正在不断增加。人们在那里不仅可以看到写着“伏尔加河—顿河航运公司”字样的新式船只，而且也可以看到许多从前在第聂伯河、顿河、伏尔加河、奥卡河上工作过的员工。泊船处的工人从早到晚忙个不停，他们一面要指挥货船的碇泊，一面又要为短程航路的游览客船服务。
    在运河的另一段航道——连接齐姆良海和顿河下游的一段运河上，船只相向开行的试航工作也胜利地完成了。六月三日，两艘柴油船拖着一条八百吨的驳船，从齐姆良海开进第十四号水闸，由于一切水力技术工程设备的操作都很正常，它们顺利地穿过了水闸。同时，伏尔加—顿运河的最后一道水闸——第十五号水闸，放过了两艘柴油船拖着的一艘驳船和其他几艘驳船，使它们浩浩荡荡地开向齐姆良海。最后，这两支船队在运河的第十四号水闸和第十五号水闸中间相遇了。集合在岸上的成千成万的建筑工人和来宾们鼓掌欢呼，热烈庆祝伏尔加—顿运河的又一个辉煌的胜利。
