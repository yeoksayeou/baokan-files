    Movie Theaters, Theaters Should Pay Attention to Improving Ventilation Equipment
    Editor: Now that the weather is hot, movie theaters and theaters in Beijing have not paid enough attention to summer hygiene. The air inside is unusually stuffy, making it difficult for the audience to bear. Because there is no or a lack of ventilation equipment, even turning on electric fans cannot change the above situation. Moreover, the electric fans are turned off after the performance starts, which greatly affects the health of the audience. I hope this issue can attract the attention of relevant departments and quickly change this situation.

    电影院、剧院应注意改善通风设备
    编辑同志：现在天气炎热，北京市各电影院和剧院，还没有足够注意到夏季卫生，场内空气异常闷塞，使观众难以忍受。因为没有或缺乏通风设备，开电扇也不能改变上述情况，且在开演后电扇反而停止，影响观众健康甚大。希望这个问题能引起有关方面的注意，迅速改变这种情况。        于策
