    Carries Out Slide Show Propaganda Work in Rural Areas

    Editor: In the past, the propaganda work of the Panshi County China-Soviet Friendship Association in Jilin Province was limited to areas with larger urban populations and failed to expand widely and deeply among the masses. Since Jilin Province started slide show operator training classes, the Panshi County China-Soviet Friendship Association began to pay attention to carrying out slide show propaganda work in a planned way, and promoted this propaganda work to the vast rural areas. Our slide show propaganda work is very popular among the masses. People in some places send people to pick us up before we even go to show the slides, and they prepare all kinds of performance preparations for us, and even act as assistants to pull the slides for us. When we performed in Matitun, many Korean women from Hengdaohezi Village carried their children and crossed the icy river to watch the slide show. When we performed in places like Changgebei and Bingjiaotun, many viewers came from ten or twenty miles away. After we finished the show, the audience was reluctant to leave and asked us to show it again. This kind of situation is very common.

    In the process of carrying out slide show propaganda, we realized that slide shows are an effective propaganda tool that is popular with the masses. The structure of the slide projector is simple and lightweight, making it easy to travel around in rural areas for screenings. Slide show propaganda is easily understood by farmers, unlike movies that flash by. In slide show propaganda, many people saw the prospects of electrification and mechanization of our motherland, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly improved. Chen Yawen, a female member of the Communist Youth League, said after watching the film "Deeds of China-Soviet Friendship": "Without the help of the Soviet Union, our national construction could not have progressed so quickly." We showed the film "No Arranged Marriages, New Things Done in a New Way" to promote the Marriage Law, and many backward parents have changed their minds. They realized that arranging their children's marriages was wrong. We showed films about cleanliness and hygiene, and many women changed their past thinking of "not clean, not dirty, eating will not cause illness." As a result, the streets of Baishui West Village were swept clean, and the people there also launched a rat-catching campaign.

    In carrying out slide show propaganda work, we have gained a little experience: using local real people and real events for propaganda and education has the greatest effect. The effect we got from showing the film "No Arranged Marriages, New Things Done in a New Way" is a good example.

### 吉林省磐石县中苏友好协会  在农村开展幻灯宣传工作

    吉林省磐石县中苏友好协会
    在农村开展幻灯宣传工作
    编辑同志：吉林省磐石县中苏友好协会过去的宣传工作，只局限于城区人口较多的地方，未能广泛而深入地在群众中间展开。自从吉林省开办幻灯工作人员训练班以后，磐石县中苏友好协会就开始注意有计划地开展幻灯宣传工作，并把这种宣传工作推广到广大农村中去。我们的幻灯宣传工作很受群众欢迎。有些地方的人民，不等我们去放映，他们就派人来接，并替我们作好了演出的种种准备工作，甚至替我们当拉片的助手。我们在马蹄屯演出时，横道河子屯就有很多朝鲜族妇女，背着孩子，涉过冰河，来看幻灯放映。我们在长胳臂、冰窖屯等地方演出时，许多观众都是从十里、二十里路以外赶来的。我们演完了，观众都舍不得走，要求我们再次放映。这种情形是非常多的。
    在进行幻灯宣传工作中，我们认识了幻灯是一种为群众喜闻乐见的有效的宣传工具。幻灯机的构造简单轻便，便于在农村中巡回放映。幻灯宣传容易为农民们所理解，不像电影一幌就过了。许多群众在幻灯宣传中，看到了我们祖国电气化、机械化的远景，他们的生产劲头大大提高了。女青年团员陈雅文看了“中苏友好事迹”的片子以后说：“要是没有苏联的帮助，我们的国家建设就不能进步得这么快。”我们放映了宣传婚姻法的“不能包办，新事新办”的片子，好多落后的父母都转变过来了。他们认识到包办儿女的婚事是错误的。我们放映了关于清洁卫生的片子，许多妇女都改变了过去的“不干不净吃了没病”的思想。白水西屯的街道上因此打扫得干干净净，那里的人民还掀起了一个捕鼠运动。
    在开展幻灯宣传工作中，我们得到了一点体会：以当地的真人真事来进行宣传教育，收效最大。我们放映“不能包办，新事新办”的片子所得到的效果，就是一个很好的例子。
