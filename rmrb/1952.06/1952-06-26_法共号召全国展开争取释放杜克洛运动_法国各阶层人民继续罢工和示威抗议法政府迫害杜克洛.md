Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: According to TASS, Paris: "L'Humanité" published on the 21st the resolution of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party's plenary session on launching a nationwide campaign to secure the release of Duclos.

The Central Committee of the French Communist Party emphasized in the resolution that the current goal of the struggle for peace and national independence is to secure the release of Duclos and all patriots. The government, acting on the instructions of Ridgway, blatantly violates the constitution and persecutes all national and democratic forces that oppose the war policy. To fight against this persecution, all anti-fascist republicans, patriots, and peace advocates must form the broadest alliance and launch a vigorous nationwide protest movement. This movement should combine the demands of various mass movements and mass organizations, and be carried out in all production units and residential areas until the conspiracies of the warmongers are defeated. Communists should strive to establish committees to defend democratic freedoms, uniting men and women from all walks of life to fight. Party organizations at all levels should organize protests and demonstrations in factories and regions as appropriate, and hold struggle days to secure the release of Duclos and all peace advocates.

The Central Committee of the French Communist Party then called for the launch of a glorious new membership drive to pay tribute to Duclos. The Central Committee urged party organizations at all levels and all activists to bravely call on the most resolute republicans, the most ideologically sound patriots, and the most outstanding peace fighters to actively join the ranks of the great Communist Party to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Central Committee of the French Communist Party finally emphasized that if this movement is successful, it will lead to the release of Duclos, which will also be a victory for democracy and peace, a victory for the working people, democrats, and all patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: According to TASS: The movement of people from all walks of life in France to defend Duclos and oppose fascist persecution continues to grow.

People across France continue to hold strikes, demonstrations, and rallies to protest the persecution of Duclos. In many places, working people from all walks of life, regardless of political ideology and religious belief, have sent delegations to the National Assembly to petition for the release of Duclos. For example, the people of the 14th arrondissement of Paris organized a Committee to Defend Duclos and went to the Palace of Justice to petition for the release of the arrested patriotic fighters. The French Veterans League of Lyon also sent a delegation to see the Chief of Police to request the release of their honorary executive member, Duclos.

Legal professionals in Paris met at the "Unity Palace" on the 20th to protest and condemn the Pinay government's illegal persecution of Duclos and democratic organizations. The National Union of Higher Education and Scientific Research Workers of France organized a meeting. Professor Barabé of the Sorbonne and Pastor Bosk, among others, spoke at the meeting, calling on everyone to join the anti-persecution struggle. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution protesting the authorities' atrocities. Members of the Teachers' Union met in Montargis, Loire, and unanimously condemned the French authorities' "recent fascist measures." More than 300 teachers in Haute-Loire and many teachers in Versailles also raised the same protests. Artisans, merchants, and small industrialists in the 13th arrondissement of Paris passed a resolution demanding the immediate release of Duclos.

Many directors and lawyers of the French National Peace Council, including Bruguière and Méniais, wrote to the examining magistrate Jaquinot, protesting the authorities' illegal search of the French National Peace Council's office. The Orléans branch of the Human Rights League announced that it would fight to defend Duclos and Stiel.

The municipal councils of Célinac (Tarn-et-Garonne) and Polignac (Dordogne), and the five mayors of Savines in the Hautes-Alpes participated in the protest movement. Some prominent figures in the Socialist Party and the Catholic Church have also risen to defend Duclos. Former National Assembly member and Socialist Auguste Reynaud wrote in the Communist newspaper "Le Marseillais" that the imprisonment of Duclos violated personal freedom. De Pédailles, a Socialist member of the Vaucluse Departmental Council, and Madame Romeo, a municipal councillor of Nas, also expressed their support for Duclos. Maillec, a Socialist Senator of Haute-Garonne, said that he was prepared to question the Senate of the Republic about the arrest of Duclos. The secretariat of the Catholic Labor League of Hérault protested the illegal arrest of patriots and the persecution of democratic organizations. Domenach, editor-in-chief of the Catholic newspaper "Esprit," and thirty-one staff members and Catholic writers jointly wrote to President Auriol, protesting the fascist atrocities of the authorities.

The French people's massive protest movement continues to achieve some victories. The Lower Seine Railway Administration has been forced to agree to reinstate the thirty railway workers who were illegally dismissed for participating in the June 4th strike to defend Duclos and oppose Ridgway.
