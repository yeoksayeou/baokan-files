Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 16th. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed Mrs. Takayoshi Tomi, a Japanese representative currently visiting Shanghai and attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, on June 16th. They asked her to clarify the rumors in Japanese newspapers that she had telegraphed Japan on the 9th of this month, saying, "If Japan can sign a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will repatriate 182,000 Japanese prisoners of war." Mrs. Takayoshi Tomi declared to the reporter: she had not sent such a telegram, and the telegram was a complete malicious fabrication. She said, "I did not have the task of discussing the conclusion of a peace treaty this time I went to the Soviet Union. I personally only heard in the Soviet Union that there are now more than 1,400 war criminals in the Soviet Union. I have no knowledge whatsoever of the so-called claim that there are more than 180,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union." Regarding the fabricated telegram, she said: "I heard that this telegram was sent from Hong Kong to Japan on the 9th of this month in my name. However, on this day, I was taking a plane from Beijing to Hankou and did not send a telegram at all. At the same time, this telegram is not only completely inconsistent in terms of time and place, but I also heard that the telegram was sent to Komakichi Matsuoka. I belong to a different political party from him, and our political views are different, so there is no reason for me to send him a telegram." Regarding who fabricated this telegram and what their intention was, she said: "It is completely unfounded to spread rumors. There are such people in Hong Kong. It is legally and morally impermissible for them to send such telegrams in my name. Perhaps some people can gain some benefits from rumors, but it is obvious that these people are not for peace. Their purpose is to provoke and undermine the cause of peace." Mrs. Takayoshi Tomi told the reporter that she had sent a telegram to Japan yesterday in response to an inquiry from the "Yomiuri Shimbun" newspaper, denying the fabricated telegram. She said: "I hope my statement can dispel the misunderstandings caused by this rumor, and I hope the Japanese people will not be misled by this rumor."

    高良富夫人辟谣
    关于苏联将遣返十八万二千名日俘的电报完全是恶意的捏造
    【新华社上海十六日电】新华社记者十六日访问了正在上海参观的、参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的日本代表高良富夫人，就日本报纸关于高良富夫人曾在本月九日电告日本国内说“如果日本能和苏联签订和约，苏联将遣返十八万二千名日本战俘”的谣言，请她加以说明。高良富夫人对记者声明：她没有发过这样的电报，这个电报完全是恶意捏造的。她说：“我这一次去苏联，并未负有讨论缔结和约的任务。我个人在苏联仅听说现在苏联还有一千四百多名战犯，所谓苏联还有十八万余名日本战俘的说法，我根本不知道。”关于那份捏造的电报，她说：“听说这份电报是本月九日用我的名义从香港发到日本的，但是，这一天我正从北京坐飞机到汉口，根本没有发过电报。同时，这一电报不但时间和地点完全不符，而且听说电报是拍给松冈驹吉的。我与他政党不同，政见也不同，没有通电报的关系。”关于谁捏造这份电报？用意何在？她说：“完全不根据事实而造谣，在香港是有这种人的，他们用我的名义发这样的电报，无论在法律上、道德上都是不能允许的。也许有一些人可以利用谣言获得一些利益，但这些人不是为了和平，那是很明显的。他们的目的是在对和平事业进行挑拨和破坏。”高良富夫人告诉记者，她昨天已发了一份电报去日本，答复“读卖新闻”报社的询问，否认了这个捏造的电报。她说：“我希望我的声明能够解开由于这个谣言所引起的误解，我希望日本人民不要为这个谣言所迷惑。”
