Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. U.S. aggressor army commander in Korea, Clark, publicly declared on the 2nd that he would use the most brutal means to slaughter our captured personnel on Koje Island. Simultaneously with Clark's arrogant clamoring, according to U.S. news agencies, the U.S. aggressors continued to provoke our captured personnel and again groundlessly shot and wounded one of our captured personnel.

Clark and commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Van Fleet, went to Koje Island on the 2nd, and their purpose was obviously to inspect the preparations for a new slaughter of our captured personnel. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 2nd, Clark publicly declared at a press conference that he "would use the greatest force" to suppress our captured personnel. Clark made no secret of the fact that he would use the most brutal means to carry out a large-scale slaughter. He said that in carrying out the suppression, all he cared about was that "his own troops shed the least blood," in other words, in order to suppress the just resistance of our captured personnel to the U.S. atrocities, Clark would not hesitate to use the most brutal slaughter weapons against our unarmed prisoners of war - including the tanks and flamethrowers that the U.S. has already announced. Clark also preposterously described the just resistance of our captured personnel on Koje Island, who are under the strict surveillance of the U.S. aggressor army, as a "riot" directed by the Korean-Chinese representatives at Panmunjom, hundreds of kilometers away from Koje Island, in an attempt to shirk his serious guilt for persecuting and slaughtering our captured personnel. But this lie was so clumsy and absurd that Clark had to immediately slap himself in the face, saying: "The United Nations forces have not received any positive information to prove that there is a direct link between Koje Island and Panmunjom."

As part of Clark's bloody conspiracy, according to an International News Service dispatch from Koje Island on the 2nd, two U.S. Patton tanks and a company of U.S. infantry rushed into Camp No. 602 to carry out new armed provocations against our captured personnel. According to an Associated Press report, half an hour after Clark left Koje Island, one of our captured personnel was shot and wounded without any reason in Camp No. 66.

    克拉克公然叫嚣将残暴屠杀我被俘人员
    美方坦克竟冲入战俘营寻衅并枪伤我被俘人员一名
    【新华社开城三日电】美国侵朝军总司令克拉克在二日公然宣称要用最残暴的手段对巨济岛上我方被俘人员进行屠杀。与克拉克的狂妄叫嚣同时，据美国通讯社透露，美国侵略者继续向我方被俘人员寻衅，并又无故枪伤我方被俘人员一人。
    克拉克和美国第八军军长范佛里特已在二日前往巨济岛，其目的显然是在检查对我方被俘人员进行新屠杀的准备工作。据美联社巨济岛二日电透露，克拉克在记者招待会上公然宣称“要使用最大的力量”来镇压我方被俘人员。克拉克毫不掩饰他将用最残暴的手段来进行大规模屠杀。他说在进行镇压中他所关心的只是使美方“自己的部队流最少的血”，换句话说，为了压制我方被俘人员对于美方暴行的正义反抗，克拉克将毫不踌躇地对我方赤手空拳的战俘使用最残暴的屠杀武器——包括美方已经宣布的坦克和喷火器在内。克拉克还信口雌黄地把在美国侵略军严密监禁下的巨济岛上我方被俘人员的正义反抗，说成是由远离巨济岛数百公里的板门店的朝中代表所指挥的“暴动”，企图这样来推卸自己迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的严重罪责。但是这个谎是撒得如此拙劣如此荒乎其唐，以致克拉克不得不马上自打耳光说：“联合国军没有得到任何正面的情报足以证明巨济岛和板门店之间有着直接联系。”
    作为克拉克的血腥阴谋的一部分，据国际新闻社巨济岛二日电透露，两辆美国的巴顿式坦克和一连美国步兵冲进了第六○二号营场，向我方被俘人员进行新的武装挑衅。另据美联社消息，在克拉克离开巨济岛以后半小时，在第六十六号营场又有我方被俘人员一人被无故枪伤。
