    Workers in the First Workshop of the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1
    Improved the Quality of Shaping Machines
    Comrade Editor: The shaping machines produced by the First Workshop of the Northeast Machinery Industry Bureau's Factory No. 1 never had high quality in the past, and never produced a first-class product. Workers Liu Yinglie and Wang Fengkun worked hard to improve the technology and produced four second-class products in March and April of this year, but the vast majority of products were still third-class. The main reason for the low product quality was that the sliding surface of the machine tool was uneven and had poor precision.

    Zhang Jinglin (Communist Party member), the head of the First Workshop, went deep into the work groups to solve this problem and carefully observed each worker's movements, believing that the workers' operating methods were not the problem. He went to the general assembly group to study and saw that the workers could find the problems when they installed the sliding surface on the large frame. He thought: Wouldn't it be more accurate to grind the sliding surface with the large frame laid down? After discussing it with veteran workers Hu En'hui and Zhang Qishan, they found a waste large frame with insufficient hardness, buried it in the ground with cement, leveled it, and ground the sliding surface on the large frame, resulting in good results. Since then, the First Workshop has never produced any returned products. Following the same principle, the workers further used the waste ram as a grinding tool, which also solved the problem of uneven ram scraping. This not only improved the quality of the sliding surface and ram, but also increased work efficiency by 30 percent. According to the production figures for the entire quarter, this created wealth equal to 1,200 tons of grain for the country.

    东北机械一厂第一车间工人
    提高了牛头刨床的质量
    编辑同志：东北机械工业管理局第一厂第一车间生产的牛头刨床，过去质量总是不高，从来没有出过一级品。工人刘英烈、王凤坤努力改进技术，在今年三、四月份制成四台二级品，但绝大部分产品还是三级品。产品质量不高的原因，主要是车床滑面不平，精密度差。
    第一车间负责人张景林（共产党员）为了解决这个问题，深入到小组中，仔细观察每一工人的动作，认为工人的操作方法并没有问题。他又到总装配组去研究，看到工人把滑面安在大架上，就能找出毛病。他就想道：如果把大架子放倒，用它研平滑面，不是就准确了吗？他和老工人胡恩惠、张岐山商量好了，找来一个硬度不够的废大架子，用洋灰埋在地下，找平度数，把滑面放在大架子上研，结果成绩良好。从此，第一车间再也不出退修品了。按照同样的道理，工人们进一步用废牛头作研具，把牛头刮研不平的问题也解决了。这样，不但提高了滑面和牛头的质量，而且提高了工作效率百分之三十，按全季生产数字计算，为国家创造了等于一千二百吨粮食的财富。    姜盛年
