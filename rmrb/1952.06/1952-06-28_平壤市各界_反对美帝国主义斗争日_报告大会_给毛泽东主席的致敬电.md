    Pyongyang City's "Day of Struggle Against US Imperialism" Report Meeting
    Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao Zedong

    To the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely aids the just Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people:

    Today, as we welcome the second anniversary of the "June 25th" Fatherland Liberation War, waged by all the Korean people for independence and honor – "Day of Struggle Against US Imperialism" – we extend our warm congratulations and national gratitude to you, our respected Chairman, and the fraternal Chinese people.

    Two years ago today, the American aggressors, in order to enslave the Korean people, attack China, and further transform Asia into their colony, launched a war of aggression against the peace-loving Korean people.

    In the past two years of the Fatherland Liberation War, our Korean people, hand in hand with the Chinese People's Volunteers, have victoriously crushed the American aggressors, the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and have gloriously defended our country's independence and freedom, making a great contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    The Korean people will forever remember the great favor bestowed upon us by the 500 million Chinese people led by you, who, during the most difficult period of the war, raised the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country," and sent the People's Volunteers, composed of their most loyal and outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean battlefield; we will remember the brilliant and great combat achievements established by the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers in our country; and we will remember their noble moral qualities.

    Today, in the historically significant struggle against the American aggressors, the brotherly friendship and unity cemented in blood between the Korean and Chinese peoples has become an invincible force and a guarantee of victory for our Korean people.

    Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! Today, the American armed aggressors, who have suffered repeated and惨敗 defeats in the face of the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples, have not abandoned their ambition to invade our Korea. They are not only deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations, but also using bacteriological weapons with the aim of mass slaughtering our people, and committing atrocities of massacring our captured personnel. As they welcome the "Day of Struggle Against US Imperialism," all the Korean people are filled with the determination to further strengthen their combat solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people, further strengthen the combat effectiveness of the heroic Korean and Chinese People's Armies, severely strike the American aggressors, and strive for more glorious victories.

    The just struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples, which is receiving the warm support and solidarity of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the great Soviet people, will surely achieve complete victory.

    For the more consolidated unity of the Korean and Chinese peoples, and for the happiness of the Chinese people, we wish you, our respected Chairman, a long life, without bounds.

    平壤市各界“反对美帝国主义斗争日”报告大会
    给毛泽东主席的致敬电
    伟大的中国人民领袖、诚挚地援助朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争的毛泽东主席：
    今天我们在迎接“六·二五”全朝鲜人民为争取独立和荣誉而进行的祖国解放战争二周年纪念日——“反对美帝国主义斗争日”的时候，谨向敬爱的您和兄弟般的中国人民致热烈的祝贺和全民族的感谢。
    美国侵略者为了奴役朝鲜人民，进攻中国，并进而变亚洲为其殖民地，在两年前的今天，发动了对爱好和平的朝鲜人民的侵略战争。
    我们朝鲜人民在过去两年的祖国解放战争中，和中国人民志愿军手携着手，胜利地击溃了朝中两国人民的共同敌人美国侵略者，光荣地保卫了我国的独立和自由，对亚洲与全世界的和平事业作了巨大的贡献。
    朝鲜人民将永远铭记着：在战争最艰苦的时期，您所领导的五万万中国人民高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的旗帜，派遣自己最忠实最优秀的儿女组成的人民志愿军到朝鲜战场来的惠泽；铭记着中国人民志愿军指战员在我国建立的灿烂的伟大的战斗功勋；并铭记着他们崇高的道德品质。
    今天，在反抗美国侵略者的有历史意义的斗争中，朝中两国人民以鲜血结成的兄弟般的友谊团结，已成为必胜不败的力量和我们朝鲜人民的胜利保障。
    敬爱的毛泽东主席！今天在朝中两国人民英雄的斗争面前屡遭惨败的美国武装侵略者，尚未放弃其对我们朝鲜侵略的野心，它不仅正在故意拖延停战谈判，而且还使用了目的在于大量屠杀我们人民的细菌武器，制造着屠杀我方被俘人员的暴行。全朝鲜人民在迎接“反对美帝国主义斗争日”之际，充满了这样的决心，坚决地要进一步加强与兄弟般的中国人民的战斗团结，进一步加强英雄的朝中人民军队的战斗力，沉重地打击美国侵略者，争取更光辉的胜利。
    受着以伟大的苏联人民为首的全世界爱好和平的人民热烈支持和声援的朝中两国人民的正义斗争，是一定会取得完全胜利的。
    为了朝中两国人民更巩固的团结，为了中国人民的幸福，谨祝敬爱的您万寿无疆。平壤市各界“反对美帝国主义斗争日”报告大会  一九五二年六月二十四日
