	Economic Briefs
	▲ The third phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou was completed at the end of May. The problems of 44,000 industrial and commercial households (accounting for 96.5% of the city's total) have been clarified, with only a very small number of households requiring further investigation. Thus, Guangzhou's "Five-Anti" struggle has achieved a basic victory and entered a stage of comprehensive case settlement. At the same time, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee is also vigorously carrying out construction work to consolidate the victory of the "Five-Anti" and develop production.
	▲ Private industrial and commercial households in Chengdu are actively developing their businesses after the "Five-Anti" movement. According to preliminary statistics, industrial and commercial households in more than 40 industries, including Chinese medicine, chemicals, machinery, and printing, have increased their capital. For example, Limin Gunny Sack Factory, Zhonghua Paper Mill, and Zhenxing Iron Factory have increased their capital by more than 800 million yuan. The processing fees and order prices for processing orders from the state have been reasonably reduced compared to before the "Five-Anti" movement, and the defect rate has also been greatly reduced. As industrial and commercial households began to actively operate, various trading markets in Chengdu gradually became active in April. According to statistics from the city's 16 trading markets, the transaction volume in April increased by 29.9% compared to March.
	▲ The "Five-Anti" movement in Shenyang has achieved a basic victory. 99.57% of private industrial and commercial households have basically cleared their problems and received case closure notices. Only a very small number of illegal households were left for special case handling due to complex issues. In the later stage of the "Five-Anti" movement, state-owned enterprises in Shenyang purchased a large number of stockpiled products from private factories, with a total purchase amount of more than 16 billion yuan, thus solving the financial difficulties of some private factories.

    ▲广州市“五反”运动第三期工作已在五月底完成。有四万四千家工商户（占全市工商户总数的百分之九十六点五）的问题已调查清楚，只有极少数工商户还要继续追查。至此，广州市的“五反”斗争已经取得基本胜利，进入全面定案处理阶段。与此同时，市“五反”运动委员会还大力进行巩固“五反”胜利和发展生产的建设工作。
    ▲成都市私营工商户“五反”后正积极开展业务。据初步统计：目前该市已有国药、化工、机械、印刷等四十多个行业的工商户增加了资金。如利民麻袋厂、中华造纸厂、振兴铁工厂等三家就增加了资金八亿多元。各厂、坊在承受国家的加工定货中的加工工缴费及定货价格，已较“五反”运动前合理地降低，次品率也大为减少。由于工商业户开始积极经营，四月份，成都市各交易市场已逐渐活跃。据该市十六个交易市场的统计：四月份的成交量已较三月份增加了百分之二十九点九。
    ▲沈阳市“五反”运动已取得基本胜利。已有百分之九十九点五七的私营工商户基本交清了问题，并已领到结案通知书，只有极少数违法户因问题复杂留作专案处理。在“五反”运动后期，沈阳市各国营企业收购了私营工厂的大批积压产品，收购总额共达一百六十多亿元，这样就解决了一些私营工厂资金周转的困难。
