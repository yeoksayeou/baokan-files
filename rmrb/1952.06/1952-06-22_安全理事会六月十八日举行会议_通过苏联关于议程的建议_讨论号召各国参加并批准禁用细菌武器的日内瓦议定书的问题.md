Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: The Security Council held a meeting on June 18th under the chairmanship of Soviet representative Malik.

    The two issues submitted by the Soviet representative for discussion by the Security Council have been included in the preliminary agenda:
    The first issue is about calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons.
    The second issue is the adoption of a recommendation to the United Nations General Assembly advocating that fourteen countries that have already applied to join the United Nations be allowed to join the United Nations simultaneously.
    The Soviet delegation has submitted the following draft resolution on the first issue for discussion by the Security Council.
    “The Security Council
    (1) In view of the divergence of opinions among politicians and public leaders regarding the permissibility of the use of bacteriological weapons;
    (2) In view of the fact that forty-two countries have signed the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, thus demonstrating the unanimous and just condemnation of the use of bacteriological weapons by world public opinion;
    (3) Therefore decides: to call upon all countries that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, whether or not they are members of the United Nations, to accede to and ratify the aforementioned protocol.”
    The draft resolution on the second issue submitted by the Soviet delegation advocates that the Security Council recommend that the General Assembly simultaneously allow the following countries that have already applied to join the United Nations to join:
    Albania, Mongolian People's Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Transjordan, Austria, Ceylon, Nepal, and Libya.
    During the discussion on the approval of the preliminary agenda, the American and British representatives did not dare to openly oppose the issues submitted by the Soviet representative for discussion by the Security Council. However, they attempted to use various procedural tricks, under the guise of "amendments," to change the substance of the issues raised by the Soviet representative.
    Malik constantly exposed and pointed out that the arguments put forward by the American and British representatives were unfounded, and at the same time refuted their amendments to the provisional agenda proposed by the Soviet Union.
    The Security Council adopted the Soviet Union's two proposals regarding the agenda without any modifications. The agenda also included a proposal jointly put forward by the Chilean and Dutch representatives to consider Resolution 506—Resolution 6 of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the admission of new members to the United Nations—as an appendix to the second item on the agenda (admission of members to the United Nations).
    After the adoption of the agenda, the Security Council proceeded to study the first item on the agenda regarding calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons. The discussion of this issue began with a speech by Malik. (The full text of Malik's speech will be sent separately)
    Subsequently, U.S. Representative Gross spoke. He said he would like to make a "few opening remarks" first. This U.S. representative tried every means possible to evade the issue and draft resolution put forward by the Soviet delegation. He openly and contemptuously denied that the U.S. armed forces used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, and talked at length about some issues that had nothing to do with the Security Council's discussion of calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons.
    Security Council President Malik immediately interrupted the U.S. representative, drawing the attention of the Security Council members to the fact that the U.S. representative's speech was completely against the rules, that he was not talking about the issue the Security Council was discussing, that he was talking about the Korean situation, while the issue on the agenda was the issue of participating in and ratifying the Geneva Protocol. Malik said: In my capacity as President of the Security Council, I would like to draw the attention of the Security Council members to the fact that the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation has nothing to do with the Korean situation. As the Soviet representative, I want to emphasize that as the Soviet representative to the Security Council who raised this issue and the draft resolution, I am only concerned with the issue of participating in and ratifying the Geneva Protocol in this matter. The Soviet delegation has not touched upon any other issues, nor has it raised any other issues. Therefore, every word the U.S. representative is saying now has nothing to do with the Security Council's agenda. I draw the attention of all members of the Security Council to this fact, and reiterate that the Soviet delegation emphasizes that it is only concerned with the issue of participating in and ratifying the Geneva Protocol.
    This statement by the Soviet representative clearly made the U.S. representative embarrassed. Unable to continue talking about the issues he had initially raised, the U.S. representative crudely slandered the Soviet Union's peace policy. The U.S. representative clumsily attempted to conceal the fact that the U.S. had refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol, using fabricated and distorted means to misrepresent the Soviet Union's reservation made when signing the Geneva Protocol: that the Protocol would only be binding on the Soviet government when it involved countries that had signed and ratified the Geneva Protocol, or had eventually acceded to it. The Protocol would not be binding on the Soviet government when the armed forces of an enemy country, as well as its formal or de facto allies, disregarded the prohibitions that constituted the purpose of the aforementioned Protocol.
    The U.S. representative could not conceal the fact that the U.S. had not ratified the Geneva Protocol it had signed for more than twenty years, and that in 1947, President Truman had actually withdrawn the Protocol, preventing the Senate from ratifying it, on the pretext that the Protocol was "outdated." Therefore, the U.S. representative had to resort to a nonsensical remark to evade the issue: that historians should explain why the U.S. had not ratified the Geneva Protocol before the war.
    Subsequently, the U.S. representative talked about the need to ensure and supervise the implementation of the ban on the use of bacteriological weapons. He concluded his speech by proposing that the draft resolution put forward by the Soviet Union regarding the request for countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons be handed over to the United Nations Disarmament Commission.
    The Soviet representative immediately responded to the U.S. representative.
    Malik said that the Soviet delegation reserves the right to comment on the absurd slanderous remarks of the U.S. representative. At present, the Soviet delegation only urges the Security Council to pay attention to some of the bankrupt arguments used by the U.S. representative.
    Malik continued, saying that it is clear to everyone that the U.S. representative is in a state of panic because he originally had his own arrangements, and it is difficult to change direction all of a sudden. He had determined another direction. Therefore, it is very difficult for him to abandon the intentions he had when he attended today's meeting, which he had already revealed in the newspapers, because just a few days ago, American newspapers published a lie he wrote, falsely claiming that the Soviet delegation intended to raise the issue of the Korean situation to the Security Council, while the Soviet delegation said today that it had raised the issue of requesting countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol, and said that it was only concerned with this issue. The events in Korea and the deeds of the American aggressors there are another matter. If the American delegation intends to discuss this issue in the Security Council, then it should put forward its proposal. If it raises such an issue, we will definitely express our opinion on this issue.
    Malik then said that the U.S. representative insisted on taking a different path, a cowardly path.
    While the Security Council was discussing the Geneva Protocol, in order to divert the Security Council's attention, he went on to talk about completely irrelevant issues that had nothing to do with the Security Council's agenda. Malik pointed out that for this reason, I, as President of the Security Council, interrupted the U.S. representative's speech on completely legitimate grounds, because it was not only against the rules but also shameless in form and aggressive in content. The U.S. representative wanted to use his untenable sophistry to cover up the truth that the U.S. government was unwilling to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons. He did not say anything about why the U.S. government had not acceded to this Protocol for twenty-two years and then suddenly discovered that this Protocol was "outdated." Not only that, but he also put forward various untenable arguments. His speech and his arguments—if they can be called arguments—are an insult to the forty-two countries and the people of these countries, which have all acceded to and ratified the Geneva Protocol, and believe that this Protocol is an important international legal standard that must be observed by the conscience and practical actions of the people of all countries. This kind of international agreement must not be disregarded, and today's aggressors can never eliminate such an important precept in the international relations system: the Geneva Protocol, which has been agreed to by forty-two countries, their governments, and their people, has become an important and recognized standard of international law and international relations. Only the U.S. government and its delegation attending the Security Council would come out against this international agreement, trying their best to defame this agreement. This fact has been confirmed today by the Security Council and all representatives attending the Security Council meeting.
    Malik pointed out: The U.S. representative's argument is obviously untenable. He mentioned reservations. But the U.S. representative obviously does not know that every country has the right to make reservations when signing international agreements. These are legitimate reservations. Official documents prepared by the United Nations Secretariat indicate that approximately twenty of the forty-two countries that ratified the Geneva Protocol made reservations of the same nature as those made by the Soviet Union. How can the U.S. representative say that the Soviet Union's reservations are "illegal"? For example, when signing and ratifying the Geneva Protocol, Britain and France made reservations of the same nature as those made by the Soviet Union. Why doesn't the U.S. representative attack these reservations made by Britain and France? Approximately twenty countries have made the same reservations. Therefore, the U.S. representative's statement insults all approximately twenty countries that made reservations on the Geneva Protocol. This is also an insult to all forty-two countries that ratified this international agreement.
    Malik continued: The U.S. representative is arguing about the right to make reservations, but this is a universally recognized right that every country should have. How can the U.S. representative's argument stand? He has no reason and nothing to use to cover up the fact that the U.S. government refuses to ratify the Geneva Protocol. Therefore, he is trying to find fabricated arguments. But this argument is instead unfavorable to the U.S. itself. The U.S. representative cannot use these statements to cover himself up, because these statements only expose the U.S.'s unwillingness to ratify the Geneva Protocol.
    Malik continued: The U.S. representative insisted that the U.S. government has put forward suggestions for banning bacteriological weapons, this saying is completely inconsistent with the facts. No one has ever seen or read any specific suggestions from the U.S. on banning the various bacteriological weapons listed in the Geneva Protocol at any place or at any time. The U.S. has not put forward this kind of suggestion. The general speech made by U.S. representative Cohen in the United Nations Disarmament Commission has nothing in common with specific suggestions for banning bacteriological weapons. The general speeches made by the U.S. representative in the United Nations Disarmament Commission and at the Security Council meetings are aimed at obstructing the banning of bacteriological weapons, in order to facilitate the preparation of bacteriological warfare. Therefore, the U.S. representative's second "argument" is also untenable, and it is inconsistent with the facts.
    Malik then exposed that the U.S. representative's third "argument" is also untenable. This argument is about the so-called "guarantees" and "controls" regarding the banning of bacteriological weapons. It is said that because there are no such "guarantees" and "controls," the U.S. government cannot ratify the Geneva Protocol. Malik cited the findings of an investigation by a special committee of the League of Nations, which showed that it is impossible to control and supervise the preparations for bacteriological warfare. Malik pointed out that this was twenty-five years ago. American scientists have also reached the same conclusion at present. The New York branch of the American Federation of Scientists sent a letter to President Truman on May 6th of this year, and the association gave a copy of this letter to the members of the Security Council. I have this letter here now. The American Federation of Scientists said in this letter that it is impossible to control and supervise bacteriological weapons. Therefore, it is even more urgent to ban bacteriological weapons and pass measures to punish those who use bacteriological weapons. Based on these authoritative investigations, only one conclusion can be drawn. The best guarantee is to ban the use of bacteriological weapons. The Geneva Protocol stipulates this. Malik pointed out that it can be seen from all of this that the U.S. delegation and the U.S. government are using unreasonable and despicable arguments to cover up its refusal to ratify the Geneva Protocol, using the empty talk about so-called "guarantees" as a cover.
    Malik also said: The U.S. delegation's suggestion to transfer this issue to the United Nations Disarmament Commission is also equally untenable. Everyone knows that the Soviet delegation suggested in the United Nations Disarmament Commission that the issue of banning bacteriological weapons and measures to punish those who violate the ban be discussed. But the U.S. delegation rejected the Soviet Union's suggestion. Now the Soviet delegation is making a suggestion in the Security Council, asking the Security Council to call on countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol, in order to consolidate peace and security, but the U.S. delegation is again suggesting that this issue be transferred to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. It turns out that the U.S. delegation is treating this issue like it's kicking a soccer ball. But we must never turn a serious international document into a soccer ball. This document has become an important standard of international law, and forty-two countries, including four of the five permanent members of the Security Council, have signed and ratified this document. In view of all these facts, it is completely clear that the U.S. delegation's arguments are extremely untenable. Equally clear is that the purpose of this argument is to avoid directly answering the question of whether the U.S. government agrees to ratify the Geneva Protocol.
    Malik continued: The Soviet delegation pointed out in its statement that the lengthy discussions in the United Nations on the issue of banning atomic weapons have diverted people's attention from the important issue of banning bacteriological weapons and the Geneva Protocol, which has become an international legal standard. The Soviet delegation calls the Security Council's attention to the fact that politicians and social leaders in many countries now have various divergent opinions about whether bacteriological weapons banned by the Geneva Protocol can be used. The Soviet delegation urges the Security Council to pay attention to the need to study this issue because some countries are preparing for bacteriological warfare, which poses a threat to the peace and security of all countries. What reason does the Security Council have not to pay attention to the Geneva Protocol? What reason does the Security Council have to disregard the fact that the overwhelming majority of countries in the world have acceded to and ratified this Protocol? What reason does the Security Council have not to issue an appeal to all other countries, asking them to accede to this Protocol and ratify it? Isn't this a step towards consolidating international peace and security? Without a doubt, this is a very important and positive step, and only the U.S. government is trying every means possible to obstruct the consolidation of international peace and security. Everyone will inevitably draw this conclusion from the statement made by the U.S. representative today.
    The Security Council meeting ended here.
    The next meeting will be reopened on June 20.

    安全理事会六月十八日举行会议
    通过苏联关于议程的建议
    讨论号召各国参加并批准禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十日电：安全理事会六月十八日在苏联代表马立克主持下举行会议。
    苏联代表提交安全理事会讨论的两个问题已列入初步议程：
    第一个问题是关于号召各国参加并批准一九二五年签订的禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的问题。
    第二个问题是通过一项致联合国大会的建议主张准许十四个已经申请参加联合国的国家同时加入联合国。
    苏联代表团已把以下关于第一个问题的决议草案提交安全理事会讨论。
    “安全理事会
    （一）鉴于各国政治家和公众领袖对能否容许使用细菌武器的问题存在着分歧的意见；
    （二）鉴于四十二个国家签订了一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，因而表现了全世界舆论一致公正地谴责使用细菌武器；
    （三）因此决定：号召凡是至今仍未批准或参加一九二五年六月十七日签订的关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家，不论其是否为联合国会员国，应一律参加并批准上述议定书。”
    苏联代表团所提的关于第二个问题的决议草案主张安全理事会建议大会同时准许下述已经提出过申请的国家加入联合国：
    阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰、意大利、葡萄牙、爱尔兰、外约旦、奥地利、锡兰、尼泊尔和利比亚。
    在讨论批准初步议程问题时，美国和英国代表不敢公然反对苏联代表提交安全理事会讨论的问题。但是他们企图利用各种程序上的花样，以“修改”做幌子来改变苏联代表所提的问题的实质。
    马立克不断地揭露并提出美英代表提出的论点毫无根据，同时驳斥了他们对苏联所提的临时议程的修正案。
    安全理事会通过了苏联的关于议程的两个建议，未作任何修改。议程中也包括了智利和荷兰代表联合提出的考虑第五百零六项决议——联合国第六届大会第六项决议关于联合国接纳新会员的决议——的提案，作为议程第二项（联合国接纳会员）的附录。
    在通过议程后，安全理事会接着研究关于号召各国参加并批准一九二五年签订的禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的第一项议程。这个问题的讨论以马立克的发言开始。（马立克的发言全文另发）
    接着，美国代表葛罗斯发言。他说他先来“几句开场白”。这位美国代表想尽了一切办法来规避苏联代表团提出的问题和决议草案，他公然以轻蔑的语调否认美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，而大谈其一些与安全理事会讨论的号召各国参加并批准一九二五年禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书毫无关系的问题。
    安全理事会主席马立克当即打断了美国代表的话，提请安全理事会理事注意，美国代表的演说完全不合规则，他所谈的不是安全理事会正在讨论的问题，他谈的是朝鲜局势，而议程上的问题是参加和批准日内瓦议定书的问题。马立克说：我以安全理事会主席的身份请安全理事会理事注意，苏联代表团提出的建议与朝鲜局势毫无关系。作为苏联代表，我要强调说明，作为提出这个问题和决议草案的苏联驻安全理事会代表，在这件事情上我所关心的只是参加和批准日内瓦议定书的问题。苏联代表团并未触及任何其他问题，也没有提出任何其他问题。因此，美国代表现在所说的每一句话，都与安全理事会的议程没有任何关系。我提请安全理事会各位理事注意这个事实，并且再度强调指出，苏联代表团着重声明：它所关心的问题，只是参加和批准日内瓦议定书的问题。
    苏联代表的这个声明显然使美国代表困窘不堪。美国代表由于不敢再谈他在一开头所谈的问题，就粗暴地大肆诬蔑苏联的和平政策。美国代表拙劣地企图掩饰美国拒绝批准日内瓦议定书的事实，就用虚构和曲解的手段来歪曲苏联在签署日内瓦议定书时所作的这样的保留：只有在涉及那些签署和批准日内瓦议定书、或终于加入日内瓦议定书的国家的时候，议定书才对苏联政府有约束力。在敌国的武装部队以及它的正式的或实际上的盟国不理会构成上述议定书目的的禁令的时候，议定书对苏联政府没有任何约束力。
    美国代表无法掩饰这样的事实：美国在二十多年期间一直不曾批准它所签署的日内瓦议定书，而在一九四七年，杜鲁门总统竟以议定书“已经过时”为借口，收回议定书不叫参院批准。因此美国代表只好用这样一句莫名其妙的话来搪塞：美国究竟为什么在战前没有批准日内瓦议定书，应由历史学家来解释。
    接着，美国代表谈到有必要保证与监督不准使用细菌武器的禁令之实施的问题。他在结束他的演说时，提出一个建议，主张把苏联所提出的关于要求各国参加并批准一九二五年签订的禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的决议草案交给联合国裁减军备委员会。
    苏联代表立即发言答复美国代表。
    马立克说，苏联代表团对于美国代表的荒谬的诽谤言论，保留发表意见的权利。目前，苏联代表团只促请安全理事会注意美国代表所利用的一些破产的论据。
    马立克继续说，人们都看得很清楚：美国代表是手忙脚乱了，因为他原来有他自己的部署，一下子要改变方向是很困难的。他所确定的是另一个方向。因此，他是很难放弃他来参加今天会议时所怀的意图的，这种意图，他已在报纸上透露出来了，因为就在前几天，美国报纸刊载了他的一篇谎话，硬说苏联代表团打算向安全理事会提出关于朝鲜事件的问题，而苏联代表团今天却说，它提出了要求各国参加并批准日内瓦议定书的问题，并且说，它只注意这个问题。朝鲜的事件以及美国侵略者在那里所干的勾当，是另外一个问题。如果美国代表团打算在安全理事会中讨论这个问题，那么它提出它的建议好了。如果它提出这种问题，我们一定发表我们对这个问题的意见。
    马立克接着说，然而美国代表偏要采取一条不同的道路，一条卑怯的道路。
    正当安全理事会讨论日内瓦议定书的时候，他为了分散安全理事会的注意，却去谈论一些与安全理事会议程没有关系的完全不相干的问题。马立克指出，就为了这种原因，我才以安全理事会主席的资格，根据完全合法的理由，打断了美国代表的话，因为这不仅不合乎规则，而且在形式上是无耻的，在内容上是气势汹汹的。美国代表想用他那站不住脚的诡辩，来掩饰美国政府不愿意批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的真相。他丝毫没有谈到为什么美国政府在二十二年期间没有参加这个议定书并且后来又突然发现这个议定书已经“过时”。非但如此，他还提出各种站不住脚的论据。他的演说以及他的论据——假若能够称为论据的话——是对于四十二个国家以及这些国家的人民的侮辱，这些国家都参加和批准了日内瓦议定书，并且认为这个议定书是各国人民的良心和实际行动所必须遵守的重要国际法标准。这种国际的协定绝对不容置之不顾，今天的侵略者绝对无法在国际关系体系里消除这样的重要箴言：得到四十二个国家，它们的政府与人民的同意的日内瓦议定书，已经成为国际法与国际关系的重要的公认的标准。只有美国政府及其出席安全理事会的代表团才会出来反对这个国际协定，竭力想毁谤这个协定。这种事实今天已为安全理事会以及出席安全理事会会议的一切代表们所证实。
    马立克指出：美国代表的论据之不能成立是很明显的。他提到保留。但是美国代表显然不知道每个国家在签订国际协定时都有权利作保留。这些是合法的保留。联合国秘书处准备的正式文件中指出，批准日内瓦议定书的四十二个国家中，约有二十个国家作了与苏联所作的同样保留。美国代表怎么能说苏联的保留是“非法性”的呢？例如：在签订与批准日内瓦议定书时，英国与法国作了与苏联所作的同样性质的保留。为什么美国代表不抨击英国与法国作的这些保留呢？约有二十个国家都作了同样的保留。因此，美国代表的说法侮辱了在日内瓦议定书上作保留的所有约二十个国家。这也是对批准这个国际协定的所有四十二个国家的侮辱。
    马立克继续说：美国代表在保留的权利上进行争执，但这是一个普遍公认的、每个国家所应有的权利。美国代表的这种论据怎样能够成立呢？他并没有理由，也并没有任何东西可以用来掩盖美国政府拒绝批准日内瓦议定书这件事。因此，他企图寻找虚构的论据。但是这个论据反而是不利于美国自己。美国代表无法用这些说法来掩饰自己，因为这些说法只是暴露了美国不愿意批准日内瓦议定书。
    马立克继续说：美国代表硬说美国政府已经提出了禁止细菌武器的建议，这种说法是与事实完全不符的。没有任何人在任何地方或任何时候看到过或读到过美国关于禁止日内瓦议定书中所列举的各种细菌武器的任何具体建议。美国并没有提出过这种建议。美国代表柯亨在联合国裁减军备委员会中所发表的一般演说，与禁止细菌武器的具体建议也没有任何共同的地方。美国代表在联合国裁减军备委员会和安全理事会会议上的一般发言，其目的是要阻挠禁止细菌武器，以便于准备细菌战争。因此，美国代表的第二个“论据”也是站不住脚的，它与事实不符。
    马立克继又揭穿美国代表的第三个“论据”也站不住脚，这个论据是关于禁止细菌武器一事的所谓“保证”与“管制”问题。据说因为没有这种“保证”与“管制”，所以美国政府不能批准日内瓦议定书。马立克举出国际联盟一个专门委员会的调查结果，这个调查结果表明，管制与监督细菌战的准备工作是不可能的。马立克指出，这是二十五年以前的事情。美国的科学家们在目前也得出了同样的结论。美国科学工作者协会纽约分会今年五月六日曾给杜鲁门总统一封信，该协会把这封信的副本交给了安全理事会的理事，我这里现在就有这封信。美国科学工作者协会在这封信里说管制和监督细菌武器是不可能的，因此，这就更迫切需要禁止细菌武器并通过惩办使用细菌武器的人们的措施了。根据这些权威的调查只能得出一个结论。最好的保证就是禁止使用细菌武器。日内瓦议定书作了这样的规定。马立克指出，从所有这些可以看出，美国代表团和美国政府在利用无理的卑鄙的论据来掩饰它拒不批准日内瓦议定书，利用关于所谓“保证”的空话来作掩护。
    马立克又说：美国代表团建议将这个问题移交联合国裁减军备委员会，这个建议也是同样站不住脚的。大家知道，苏联代表团在联合国裁减军备委员会上曾建议讨论禁用细菌武器和惩办那些破坏禁令者的措施问题。但是美国代表团拒绝了苏联的建议。现在苏联代表团在安全理事会上提出建议，要求安全理事会号召各国参加并批准日内瓦议定书，以巩固和平和安全，而美国代表团却又建议把这个问题移交联合国裁减军备委员会。原来美国代表团竟然用和踢足球一样的办法来对待这个问题。但我们决不能把一个严肃的国际文件变成足球，这个文件已经成了国际法的一个重要标准，有四十二个国家包括安全理事会五个常任理事国中的四个国家，已经签署并批准了这个文件。鉴于所有这些事实，美国代表团的论点的极端站不住脚是完全明显的，同样明显的是：这种论据的目的在于逃避直接答复美国政府是否同意批准日内瓦议定书这个问题。
    马立克继续说：苏联代表团在它的声明中指出，在联合国中对禁止原子武器问题的长期讨论，分散了人们对于禁止细菌武器这个重要问题和已经成为国际法律的标准的日内瓦议定书的注意力。苏联代表团唤起安全理事会注意这一事实：许多国家的政治家及社会领袖们，对于是否可以使用为日内瓦议定书所禁止的细菌武器一节，现在有着各种分歧的意见。苏联代表团促请安全理事会注意有必要研究这个问题，因为有些国家正在进行细菌战的准备，这对各国的和平与安全造成了威胁。安全理事会有什么理由不注意日内瓦议定书？安全理事会有什么理由不顾到世界上压倒多数国家已参加并批准这个议定书的这个事实呢？安全理事会有什么理由不向所有其他国家发出呼吁，要求它们参加这个议定书并加以批准呢？难道这不是巩固国际和平与安全的一个步骤吗？毫无疑问，这是一个十分重要而且积极的步骤，只有美国政府才想尽各种办法来阻挠国际和平与安全的巩固。每个人都必然会从美国代表今天的声明中得出这个结论。
    安全理事会会议到此结束。
    下一次会议将在六月二十日再开。
