To raise the artistic level of short stories
    The Soviet Literature newspaper published an editorial on May 15th, pointing out the importance of raising the artistic level of short stories. The summary is as follows:
    For writers, engaging in short story creation is a school for honing writing skills. Therefore, it is no accident that Gogol's creation began with "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" and Turgenev's writing began with "A Sportsman's Sketches."
    Short stories are very clear from beginning to end in front of readers. Short stories do not allow for any structural laxity or stylistic weakness. Any frivolous wording will harm the story itself. "Expressing many things in a small space" is the artistic rule of this kind of work.
    In the post-war period, our interest in short stories had declined somewhat (not from readers, but from writers and editors!). In the past two years, short stories have begun to show a new and significant wave of activity. At the same time, magazines, publishers, and critics have also increased their attention to short stories, caring about the development of this type of literature.
    However, not all literary magazines and publishers have shown the necessary concern for the development of short stories. For example, "October" magazine did not publish a single short story in the entire year of 1951, which is unacceptable.
    In this literary genre of short stories, many shortcomings of our prose can be seen. Some short stories are still written with poor content, only skimming the surface of life, while using gorgeous rhetoric to replace the real description of reality, and using crude effects to replace real conflicts. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that we often cannot see short stories that can impress readers, excite them, and enrich their inner lives when we browse through some magazines.
    The field of short story creation is endless. The genre of Soviet short stories is very diverse, both in terms of its stylistic characteristics and its themes.
    One can often hear some incorrect opinions: it seems that small forms can only include small content, small characters, and small ideas. The process of this argument is like this: those materials and plots that cannot be used as novels and novellas due to their smallness are naturally collected by short stories into "their own net."
    This is an extremely wrong and harmful "concept"! Judging from its impact on short stories, it will undoubtedly reduce the ideological nature of this noble literary writing genre.
    A short story is by no means a corner of a painting, or a fragment, but the painting itself. It should be recognized as an artistic work with complete value, because such works can give readers' consciousness and feelings rich content. Of course, we should also consider the characteristics of this style: we cannot require short stories to explain all the causes and consequences as large works must. Unnecessary details, secondary narratives, and even repeatedly stated ideas should not be piled up in short stories.
    Finding out some good and bad trends that have played a role in short stories in recent years, and discovering and paying attention to these trends from the materials of the works, is the responsibility of our critics. Critics should help short story writers find ways to creatively overcome their shortcomings.

### 提高短篇小说的艺术水平

    提高短篇小说的艺术水平
    苏联文学报五月十五日发表社论，指出提高短篇小
    说的艺术水平的重要，摘要如下：
    从事短篇小说的创作，对于作家来说，是锻炼写作技巧的学校。因此，果戈理的创作从“狄肯加邻村的夜晚”开始，屠格涅夫的写作从“猎人日记”开始，都不是偶然的。
    短篇小说在读者面前从头到尾是非常清晰的。短篇小说中，不容许有任何结构松弛和文体萎靡的现象。任何一个轻率的词句，都会使小说本身受到损害。“不大的篇幅表达很多的事物”，便是这种作品的艺术法则。
    在战后时期，我国对短篇小说的兴趣曾有一些低落（不是来自读者，而是来自作家和编辑方面！）。近两年来，短篇小说又开始有了新的显著的活跃气象。同时各杂志、出版社和批评家也提高了对短篇小说的注意，关怀这一类文学的发展。
    但是，并不是所有的文学杂志和出版社都对短篇小说的发展表现了必要的关怀。例如，“十月”杂志在一九五一年全年，就没有刊登过一篇短篇小说，这种现象是不能令人容忍的。
    在短篇小说这种文学体裁中，可以看出我们的散文中的很多缺点。一些短篇小说仍是写得内容贫乏，只从生活的表面滑过，同时用华丽的词藻来代替对现实的真正描写，以粗劣的效果来代替真实的冲突。也许正是因为这样，才使我们在翻阅一些杂志时，经常看不到能使读者留下印象，能激动他们并充实他们内心生活的短篇小说。
    短篇小说的创作领域是无穷无尽的。苏联短篇小说的体裁不论是就它的风格特点或它的主题而论，都是非常富于多样性的。
    经常可以听到一些不正确的意见：似乎小的形式就只能包括小的内容，小人物和小的思想。这种议论的过程是这样的：那些由于小而不能作为长篇和中篇小说的材料和情节的东西，自然就由短篇小说收集到“自己的网”中了。
    这是一个极端错误而有害的“概念”！以它对短篇小说的影响来看，无疑地会降低这一高尚的文学写作体裁的思想性。
    短篇小说决不是一幅画的一角，或一个断片，而是画面本身。它应当被认作是一种具有完全价值的艺术作品，因为这样作品能够给读者的意识和感情以丰富的内容。当然，我们也应当考虑到这一文体的特点：不能要求短篇小说像大作品所必需的一样能说明全部原因和结果。不能把不必要的细节、次要的叙述、甚至是一再申述的思想，都堆积于短篇小说中。
    找出近年以来在短篇小说中起作用的一些好的和坏的倾向，从作品的材料中发现和注意这些倾向，这就是我们的批评家的责任。批评家应当帮助短篇小说作家找出创造性地克服缺点的途径。
