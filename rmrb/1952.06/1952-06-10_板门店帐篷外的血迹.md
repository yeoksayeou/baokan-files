    Bloodstains Outside the Panmunjom Tent
    Liu Baiyu

    From Kaesong, advancing along the ten-li highway, under a sparse scattering of pine trees, a cluster of tents is pitched – this is the Panmunjom armistice negotiation site. Although this place is small, it represents the decision of world-shaking importance. Logically, the establishment of this venue is for peace, but when I visited Panmunjom for the fourth time, I personally saw the blood of Koreans killed by American bombs within the conference area. This tragedy occurred at 8:40 AM on June 5th, when American invaders used seventy air-burst bombs to bombard the northern part of the conference area. Although this area is located on the front lines, according to the conference area agreement, "no hostile actions should be conducted in the conference area as stipulated above." This place should have been tranquil. The American army itself raised balloons in the four corners of the conference area and also placed red cloth boards on the edges. The day before, there had been a good rain, and this morning, farmers went to the fields with joyful hearts. Min Bingji's parents were hoeing in their bean field when the bombs suddenly exploded around them. Braving the whistling shrapnel, the parents immediately ran to their children. Two children playing on the ridge had already been knocked down by the explosions. Blood gushed from three-year-old Bingshun's head and eleven-year-old Bingji's leg, flowing onto the land within the conference area. At the same time, Cui Songyu's mother also dropped her work and hurried to find Songyu, but this twelve-year-old girl had fallen to the ground. Shrapnel had already pierced her small, tender heart, and she lay pale, with blood flowing from the corner of her mouth. Also at the same time, a dozen yards outside the edge of the conference area, a Korean woman, Jin Qingshi, happily carried her infant on her back, leading her two-year-old son Chenghuan by the hand. The mother, along with her eldest daughter, Yu Ji, and second son, Shihuan, were walking along the road. The beloved mother and children were walking when the bombs exploded. She and the son she held in her hand were immediately killed. The baby on her back cried miserably, with bright red blood oozing from one of its small feet. No more than ten steps away from them, the young farmer Wu Yonghua was working in the field when the bombs struck him, severing his right arm. But he did not die. He gritted his teeth and ran to his brother's house. He died without saying a word after arriving. In this cruel bombardment, five people died and nine were injured. Blood was splattered everywhere inside and outside the conference area. I personally saw the blood of these peaceful Korean women, youths, and infants, the brains and shredded hair scattered on the ground. Did they commit any crime? Listen, the old grandmother is wailing in grief, and the little girl Song Yuji, who escaped from the horror of death, has no tears in her eyes, only hatred. She said, "You must avenge us!" Anyone with a bit of humanity, who could see this scene without feeling sorrow and anger? This is what the American negotiating representatives sitting at the Panmunjom negotiating table have done to sabotage the negotiations. We must solemnly warn them that they have already fired bombs into the conference area and splashed the blood of innocent, kind Korean children in the conference area. These bloodstains will remain forever as evidence. Even when our security officer Li Qiang and American security officer Lieutenant Haines conducted an investigation on the same day, he had to lower his head and confess.
    Li Qiang: "What is your opinion of the results of the on-site investigation?"
    Haines: "I think this is an incident within the conference area."
    Li Qiang: "After listening to the witnesses' testimonies and seeing the physical evidence of the shrapnel, do you believe that this was your side's doing?"
    Haines: "I admit it."
    But if you only think that the American invaders' shamelessness lies in their bestial and bloody massacre, then you do not yet understand today's American fascists. They also want to make shameless denials for the massacre. The armistice negotiations have been going on for more than eleven months, and the tents at Panmunjom have faded to white with the wear and tear of time, but what exactly have the American invaders done outside the tents? The first time I stood at Panmunjom, it was precisely on the day that Joy handed over the position of chief representative to Harrison. This pale and dry man said his last words at the negotiating table: "May God be with you." But it is these people who constantly mutter about their "God" who are the most shameless people in the world. Their characteristic is that they can deny their own words. They talk about "humanitarian principles" in meetings, but reach out to murder. They are businessmen at store counters, they have no flesh-and-blood conscience, only a black heart full of greed and sinister eyes. I would like to use one fact to illustrate these American imperialist elements, because just a few days ago I happened to have visited the area that was bombarded today. I wasn't there to see the green wheat fields or rice paddies, but to investigate another bloody case committed by the American invaders in this place eight months ago. That time, three jet planes murdered a lively and young twelve-year-old child, Jiang Yongdun. When the bloody and mangled dead child was placed before him, even the American liaison officer's face turned pale. Jiang Yongdun's father grabbed the American officer by the collar: "You are an American, you have to be responsible, give me back my son." Under the just accusation, the American officer begged in embarrassment: "Let me go! This matter is the responsibility of our representatives." But as soon as he turned his face, he drew a sketch of a swept-wing volunteer jet aircraft on the ground, intimidating the child witness Jiang Yongyun to confess. As soon as he left the investigation site, escaped from the old father's righteous gaze, with the bloody dead child still in front of his eyes, he sat in their jeep and laughed inhumanly. Even more typical was an investigation into an incident of aircraft strafing the Kaesong urban area. The evidence was undeniable, and finally, the American imperialist element named Dairo absurdly and shamelessly said: "Unless I was personally present at the time, I have no way of determining." Our liaison officer made a most appropriate annotation for him: "In this case, the only solution is that you fell from the plane and landed here at the time." All of this is the rogue face of today's American fascists, and it is such people who can do such things. If you stand at Panmunjom, opposite you are Harrison, Libby, or Tenner, think of the barbed wire of Geoje Island, the flamethrower tanks, tear gas, high-temperature torture chambers, and the fresh blood of the Chinese and Korean prisoners of war that flows every day. Think again of Dodd and Colson, who bowed their heads and confessed to the heroic prisoners of war, and then think again of Clark, who shamelessly denied it, then think again of Bonner, with his blood-stained hands, and finally return to the Panmunjom negotiating table and listen to Harrison's daily recitation of "just" "screening of prisoners of war." What would you think? Not long ago, I went to Southeast Asia. I heard that there is a huge animal similar to a bat in the great forests of Southeast Asia. Its blood is cold, but it sucks human hot blood to suck people to death in order to fatten itself. Isn't this the portrait of American imperialism? I remember that everyone who saw the movie "Nuremberg Trials" was indignant that Hitler actually used human skin to make gloves, but isn't the repatriation of prisoners of war, which is the crux of today's armistice negotiations, the American cannon fodder dealers plotting personal gain to fatten themselves? Today's blood tragedy that I witnessed with my own eyes even more severely exposes the American invaders' consistent crimes of destroying the neutral zone, because this is no longer a problem of the neutral zone, but a problem of the conference area. But look at their "Panmunjom Five Days" news! He said: "One thousand yards outside the neutral zone", "This morning, the Allied forces' artillery bombarded the Communist army's trench area". Forget it! This is not a reporter, this is a dog barking after its shameless master. Isn't that the conference area? Is that loving mother with four children a soldier in the trenches? Is that infant who can't even walk digging trenches? Is the blood of Cui Songyu, whom I saw dying in the hospital today, flowing outside the conference area? Is Lieutenant Haines slapping himself in the face again? The facts are clear: If we draw a battle line in the middle of the Panmunjom negotiating table, on this side of the line are the people who defend peace, and on the other side of the line are the people who conspire war. Look at Harrison, the pretentious person on that side of the line, his hands holding the speech manuscript. Maybe the back of his hands are wiped clean, but what about his palms? Aren't they covered with the blood of the people in the front and rear of the Korean War, the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, and next to the tents? Every day the meeting begins, the American invaders' artillery frantically bombard the forward positions of our army outside the tents. According to their reporters, they use shells as punctuation marks for their speeches, which portrays the face of the butcher. But no conspiracy can escape the righteous eyes on this side of the negotiating table. When I visited Panmunjom, I saw General Nam Il and his companions solemnly walking into the meeting every day, fighting strongly for the victory of peace in Korea and the world. People all over the world can hear their just voices from Panmunjom, more solemn and louder day by day, because this voice comes from the hearts of people all over the world, the voice demanding peace, the voice accusing the American invaders' crimes.

    板门店帐篷外的血迹
    刘白羽
    由开城前进十几里公路边，稀稀的几株松树下搭了一片帐篷，这就是板门店停战谈判会场，这个地方虽然小，但表示决定着有关世界的大问题。按道理讲这个会场的设置是为了和平，但当我第四次访问板门店的时候，我却亲眼看见会场区内美国炮弹炸死的朝鲜人的血。这个悲剧发生在六月五日早晨八点四十分钟，美国侵略者用七十发空炸炮弹轰击了会场区的北部，这个地区虽处于前线，可是按照会场区协议“对于如上规定的会场区……均不得进行任何敌对行动”，这里应该是宁静的，美国军队自己在会场区四角升起气球，还在边沿安置下红布板。头一天落过一场好雨，这个清早，农民们都带着欣喜心情下地。闵丙姬的父母在自己的豆子地上锄土，可是炮弹就在周围突然爆炸起来。父母冒着飞啸的弹片立刻向孩子们奔去，两个在田垅上玩耍的孩子已被炸倒，血从三岁的丙顺头部、十一岁的丙姬腿上涌出，血流在会场区内土地上。同一个时间崔松玉的母亲也丢下手里的活，赶紧找松玉，可是这个十二岁的小姑娘倒在地下，弹片已经打进她小小的稚嫩的心脏，她面色苍白顺着嘴角流出鲜血。也是同一个时间，在会场区边缘外十几码的地方，朝鲜妇女金庆锡欢欢喜喜地驮着幼小的婴儿，一手领着两岁的爱儿承焕。妈妈前边走着大女儿玉姬和第二个儿子世焕。亲爱的母子们正走在路上，炮弹爆炸了，她和手上领的儿子立刻被炸死，背上的婴儿悲惨的哭了，他的一只小小的脚上冒出鲜红的血。距她们不过十步，青年农民吴勇花正在田里劳作，炮弹把他崩倒，砍去右臂，可是他没死，他紧紧咬着牙往哥哥家跑，他跑到家没说一句话就死了。在这残酷的一阵炮击下，死亡五人，负伤九人，会场区边缘里外到处沾着鲜血。我亲眼看见这些和平的朝鲜妇女、青年和婴儿的鲜血，流在地下的脑浆和撕碎的头发。难道他们有什么罪吗？你听，老祖母哀哀痛哭，从死亡的恐怖下逃出来的小姑娘宋玉姬眼中没有泪只有仇恨。她说：“一定要给我们报仇呀！”凡是有一点人性的人，谁能看了这情景不沉痛，不愤怒？这就是坐在板门店谈判桌那面的美方谈判代表所做的破坏谈判的事。我们要严正警告他们，他们已经把炮弹打入会场区，他们把无辜的善良的朝鲜孩子的血溅在会场区，这些血迹将永远留下作证。就是当天我方安全军官李强和美方安全军官海恩斯中尉进行调查时，他也不得不低头认罪。
    李强：“对于调查现场的结果，你的看法如何？”
    海恩斯：“我认为这是在会场区内的事件。”
    李强：“听取证人的证词及看了物证炮弹片以后，你是否认为这是你方的行为。”
    海恩斯：“承认。”
    可是如果你只认为美国侵略者的无耻只在于他那兽性的血腥屠杀，那你还不了解今日的美国法西斯，他们还要为屠杀作无耻抵赖。停战谈判已经十一个多月了，板门店的帐篷已在时日磨损中褪为白色，但是美国侵略者究竟在帐篷外做了些什么事呢？我第一次站在板门店，恰好是乔埃把首席代表位置移交给哈利逊那一天。这个面色苍白而枯燥的人讲他在谈判桌上的最后一句话：“愿上帝与你同在”。可是就是这嘴头上常常叨念他们的“上帝”的人，是世界上最无耻的人。他们的特点是他们自己嘴里说出的话，自己就可以不认账。他们在会议上讲着“人道原则”，却伸手在谋杀。他们是贩卖店柜台上做生意的人，他们没有血肉的良心，只有充满利欲的黑心和阴险的眼睛。我想拿一件事实来说明这些美帝国主义分子，因为就在几天前恰巧我到过今天被炮击的地区。我不是为了看青青的麦地或稻田，而是调查八个月以前美国侵略者在此地所犯的另一血案。那一次是三架喷气式飞机谋杀一个活泼而幼小的十二岁儿童姜永敦，当这个血肉模糊的死孩子摆在面前，把美国联络官脸也吓白了。姜永敦的父亲一把抓住这个美国军官衣领：“你是一个美国人，你就要负责，你还我的儿子来。”在正义的责罚下，这个美国军官狼狈哀求：“你放了我吧！这事由我们代表负责。”可是一转过脸，他就在地下画一架翅翼后掠的志愿军喷气式机的样式威吓作证人的小孩姜永运承认。等到一离开调查现地，从老父亲正义的眼光下逃出，血淋淋的死孩子还在眼前，一坐上他们的吉普就毫无人性地嘻笑起来。更典型的是一次调查飞机扫射开城市区事件。证据已经无可抵赖，最后那个叫戴罗的美帝国主义分子竟荒唐无耻的说：“除非我当时亲自在场，否则我没有方法可以确定。”我们的联络官给他做了一个再恰当不过的注解：“在这种情况下，唯一办法是当时你从飞机上摔下来落在此地。”这一切就是今天美国法西斯的流氓面目，就是这样的人做得出这样的事。你如果站在板门店，对面就是哈利逊、李比或者滕纳，你想一想巨济岛的铁丝网、喷火坦克、催泪瓦斯、高气温的刑室，每天在流着的中朝战俘的鲜血。你再想一想在英勇战俘面前低头认罪的杜德和柯尔生，你再想一想厚颜无耻矢口否认的克拉克，再想一想双手鲜血的波纳，最后你再回到板门店谈判桌上听听哈利逊每天诵念的“公正”的“甄别战俘”，你会怎样想呢？我不久以前到过东南亚，我听说东南亚大森林中有一种类似蝙蝠的巨大动物，它的血是冷的，但它要吸人的热血，把人吸死，以养肥自己。这不就是美帝国主义的肖像吗？我记得每个人看了“纽伦堡审判”这部电影，莫不愤恨希特勒竟然拿人皮做手套，可是今天停战谈判症结所在的遣俘问题不就是美国炮灰贩子在这里面图谋私利以自肥吗？今天我亲眼所见的血的悲剧就更严厉地揭露美国侵略者一贯破坏中立区的罪行，因为这已不是中立区的问题，而是会场区的问题。可是你看看他们这条“板门店五日”的新闻吧！他说：“中立区外一千码”、“今晨联军大炮轰击共军的战壕区”。算了吧！这不是记者，这是狗跟着无耻的主子作吠。难道那不是会场区吗？难道那个带着四个孩子的慈爱的母亲是战壕里的军人吗？难道那还不会走路的婴儿是挖战壕的吗？难道我今天在医院里看见的奄奄一息的崔松玉的血是流在会场区以外吗？难道海恩斯中尉的手又在打自己的嘴巴吗？事实是分明的，如果我们在板门店谈判桌中间划一条战线，线这一面是保卫和平的人，线那一面是阴谋战争的人，你看看线那面的那个矫揉造作的哈利逊，他那捧着讲话稿子的手，那手背也许揩干净了，但手心里呢？不是涂满朝鲜前线和后方的巨济岛战俘营的以及帐篷旁边的人民的鲜血吗？每天会议开始，美国侵略者的炮就疯狂地轰击帐篷外面我军前沿阵地，据他们的记者说，他们是拿炮弹当他们讲话的标点的，这倒形容出了屠夫的面目。可是任何阴谋也难逃避谈判桌这面的正义的眼光。我在板门店访问的时候，我瞧见南日将军和他的同伴每天郑重地走入会场，他们为了获得朝鲜的也是世界的和平胜利而坚强地斗争着。全世界人民都听得见他们从板门店发出的正义的声音，一天比一天庄严宏亮，因为这声音就是来自世界人民心底的声音，要求和平的声音，控诉美国侵略者罪行的声音。    （新华社）
