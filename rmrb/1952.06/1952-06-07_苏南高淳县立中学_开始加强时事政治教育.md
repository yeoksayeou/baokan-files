Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Gaochun County Middle School in Southern Jiangsu
    Begins to Strengthen Current Affairs and Political Education
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on May 17th published Wang Zhaoyu's letter, which criticized our school for neglecting to lead students in regular current affairs study. This criticism is entirely correct. Since the beginning of this semester, we have not paid attention to the students' current affairs learning. Although we scheduled half an hour of newspaper reading class every Tuesday and Friday afternoon, the system became a mere formality due to a lack of leadership. Students usually did not care much about current affairs, and few people read newspapers in the reading room. We had not paid attention to this serious tendency of neglecting politics until we held a current affairs test and realized the seriousness of the problem. Now we have organized a newspaper reading committee to lead the entire school in newspaper reading and study, and have stipulated a daily newspaper reading time, strengthening political education in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" and "Epidemic Prevention and Hygiene" movements. The result of doing so has played a significant role in the ideological transformation of teachers and the ideological education of students. However, because we only paid attention to reading newspapers in conjunction with political movements, we talked very little about other current affairs issues, and students still lacked the necessary understanding of certain current affairs issues. In the future, we must conduct current affairs and political education in a planned and step-by-step manner, combined with the students' ideological situation.

### 苏南高淳县立中学  开始加强时事政治教育

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    苏南高淳县立中学
    开始加强时事政治教育
    编辑同志：五月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了汪昭瑜的来信，对我校忽视领导学生进行经常性的时事学习提出了批评，这个批评是十分正确的。本学期开学以后，我们没有重视同学们的时事学习，虽然在每星期二、五两天下午排了半小时的读报课，但是因为缺乏领导，制度流于形式。同学们平时对时事问题很不关心，阅报室里很少有人看报。对这种严重的忽视政治的倾向，我们一直没有注意，直到举行了一次时事测验，才发觉了问题的严重性。现在我们已组织了读报委员会领导全校读报学习，并规定了每天的读报时间，配合“三反”及“防疫卫生”运动加强了政治教育。这样做的结果，对教师的思想改造和同学们的思想教育，起了很大作用。但是由于我们只注意配合政治运动进行读报，因此对其他时事问题讲得很少，同学们对某些时事问题仍然缺乏应有的认识。今后我们一定要结合同学们的思想情况，有计划、有步骤地进行时事和政治教育。
