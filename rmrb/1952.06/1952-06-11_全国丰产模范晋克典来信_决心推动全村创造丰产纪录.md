Letter from National Model Farmer Jin Kedian
Determined to Promote the Village to Create a丰产 Record

To the Editor: The Communist Party and the People's Government care for us peasants in every possible way. After liberation, we not only received land, but the government also lent us fertilizer, waterwheels, new farm implements, and improved seeds, and introduced us to advanced production techniques. My wheat丰产 this year is entirely due to the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. I want to create even higher丰产 records on the basis of organization, and motivate every household in our village to achieve丰产 results, in order to repay the Communist Party and the People's Government. I deeply realize that in our New Democratic country, the relationship between the working people and the People's Government is an invincible productive force.

In the era of reactionary rule, even though we exerted all our strength, we still suffered from hunger. After liberation, my family received more than thirty mu of land. The whole family was happy and said, "Our land has returned home!" I immediately applied fertilizer and processed it. I did whatever the government called for. Since 1948, I have had丰产 every year. My production is good, and my life has improved rapidly. Now my living standards have increased two or three times. Even the bedding on the kang, the clothes on my body, the kitchen utensils, and sanitation facilities have slowly been replaced with new ones. Special attention is also paid to cleanliness in the place where livestock are raised. Originally, I only had one ox, but in 1950 I added two more. I had a new-style seven-inch walking plow and started learning new farming methods such as warm water seed soaking, seed selection, and using pesticides to kill insects. My good production has also promoted the production work of the whole village. People in neighboring villages reflect that "Pule Village has good land." In fact, it's not that Pule Village has good land, it's really that everyone's production enthusiasm has been raised and production is energetic. Since I received the award from the Central People's Government, the masses have come to congratulate me. This is an honor I have never had in my life. The peasants also recognize the glory of labor, and everyone wants to strive to be a model. On the spot, everyone cheered: We must strive to win victories on the production front.

    全国丰产模范晋克典来信
    决心推动全村创造丰产纪录
    编辑同志：共产党和人民政府对我们农民的关心是无微不至的。解放后我们不但分到了土地，政府还贷给我们肥料、水车、新式农具和优良种籽，给我们介绍先进的生产技术。今年我的小麦能够丰产，完全是依靠了党和人民政府的领导。我要在组织起来的基础上，创造更高的丰产纪录，并带动我们村里家家户户都创造丰产成绩，以报答共产党和人民政府。我深深体验到，在我们新民主主义国家里，劳动人民和人民政府这种乳水交融的关系，是不可战胜的生产力量。
    在反动派统治的时代，我们虽然出尽了力气，还得挨尽饥饿。解放以后，我家分得了三十多亩土地。全家人都喜欢，说：“我们的土地回到老家了”！我立即施肥加工，政府怎么号召，我就怎么干。由一九四八年起，每年我都丰产。我生产得好，生活也就上升得快。现在生活提高了两三倍，连炕上的被褥、身上的衣服、灶房用具、卫生设备都慢慢换成新的了。喂养牲口的地方也特别注意清洁。原来我只有一头牛，到一九五○年又添了两头牛。有了新式的七寸步犁，开始学习温汤浸种、选种、用药剂杀虫等新式耕作方法。我的生产好了，也推动了全村的生产工作。邻村群众反映说：“普乐村的地好。”其实并不是普乐村的地好，实在是大家的生产情绪提高了、生产带劲了。自从我受了中央人民政府的奖励，群众都来祝贺我。这是我有生以来未曾有过的荣誉。农民们也认识到劳动的光荣，大家都要争取当模范。当场大家都欢呼：要在生产战线上争取打胜仗。
