A short commentary:

    Correct the Phenomenon of Neglecting the Patriotic Health Campaign
    Currently, the Patriotic Health Campaign has been launched in many regions. However, on a national scale, the progress of the movement still has shortcomings of being uneven, not widespread, and not in-depth. Apart from a few large and medium-sized cities that are doing better, most rural areas have not yet been mobilized. Within the cities, the hygiene work of the troops and the general public is better, while the work of government offices, factories, schools, and organizations is relatively poor; especially some government offices and factories, which have almost become "dead corners" of hygiene work.
    The fundamental reason for the above situation is that many cadres (including hygiene workers) still lack a correct understanding of the Patriotic Health Campaign.
    Some cadres view the Patriotic Health Campaign as opposed to the patriotic production increase and economy campaign in factories and rural areas. They emphasize being busy with work and production; they believe that carrying out hygiene work will hinder production and delay work. Some factory leaders even fail to mobilize employees to get vaccinations, fearing that the reactions caused by the injections will affect production. They also ignore employees' suggestions for catching rats and flies. They fail to see the possible consequences of neglecting hygiene and emphasize that "it has always been like this in the past, and there is nothing serious about it." If these units are engaged in production increase and economy competitions, they are even less willing to launch a hygiene campaign. These comrades do not understand that the health of employees and farmers is an important guarantee for the smooth development of the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. To ensure good health, hygiene work must be done well. Therefore, the production increase and economy campaign and the hygiene campaign should and can be combined completely. As for the contradiction in time, as long as the consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses are fully mobilized, and everyone comes up with solutions, it can certainly be overcome. The experience of some factories in Northeast China fully proves this. In some rural areas, the development of the hygiene campaign has not only reduced diseases and enhanced labor productivity but also increased a lot of fertilizer.
    Some hygiene workers simply rely on higher authorities and emphasize poor objective conditions. They just wait for the higher authorities to send health teams and wait for sufficient equipment and funds to solve problems, but they neglect the power of the millions of masses. As a result of waiting, hygiene work stagnates. Cleaning, sweeping, catching rats, and catching flies, which can be completely done by the masses, are all delayed.
    There are also some cadres who do not regard hygiene work as a long-term construction task but as a simple formality, just to get it over with. The staff of the Xinmin County People's Government in Northeast China refused a hygiene inspection, declaring that "the movement has reached the consolidation stage." However, the final inspection revealed that piles of cattle and horse manure had accumulated in the yard again.
    The lack of emphasis on hygiene publicity in some places also affects the development of the movement. For example, newspapers such as Songjiang Daily in Northeast China, Chuannan Daily in Southwest China, Southern Daily in Central South China, Guangxi Daily, Jiangxi Daily, and Gansu Daily in Northwest China do not pay enough attention to hygiene publicity.
    All of the above phenomena show that some cadres still have not realized that carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign is a practical action against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism and is a serious political task of the Chinese people at present. In response to these phenomena, we must strengthen publicity and education work to make the broad masses of cadres and people realize the great political significance of this movement, understand the relationship between this movement and the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, overcome the idea of simply relying on higher authorities and emphasizing objective difficulties, rely on the broad masses, persist in carrying it out unremittingly, and prevent the phenomenon of things returning to the way they were after the movement is over. In mobilizing the masses, special attention should be paid to mobilizing women. Because, whether in urban or rural areas, most of the cleaning and hygiene affairs of families are usually undertaken by women, and they are the main force for doing a good job in personal and environmental hygiene. For areas and units where hygiene work is backward, effective steps must be taken immediately to strengthen this work; for areas and units that have already achieved results, inspections should also be carried out at any time to consolidate the results.

### 纠正忽视爱国卫生运动的现象

    纠正忽视爱国卫生运动的现象
    目前，爱国卫生运动已经在许多地区开展起来。但就全国范围说，运动的进展，仍然存在着不平衡、不普遍、不深入的缺点。除了一部分大、中城市开展得较好以外，大部分农村还没有动起来。在城市内，则是部队和一般市民的卫生工作做得较好，机关、工厂、学校、团体做得比较差；特别是一部分机关、工厂，几乎成了卫生工作的“死角”。
    造成以上情况的根本原因，是许多干部（包括卫生工作干部）对于爱国卫生运动还缺乏正确的认识。
    有些干部把爱国卫生运动和工厂、农村的爱国增产节约运动对立起来看待。他们强调工作忙，生产忙；认为开展卫生工作会妨害生产、耽误工作。有的工厂负责人甚至不动员职工打防疫针，怕因打针引起的反应影响了生产。对于职工捕鼠灭蝇的建议，也不理睬。他们看不到不讲究卫生可能发生的后果，而强调“过去从来如此，没有什么了不起”。这些单位如果正搞增产节约竞赛，就更不愿意发动卫生运动。这些同志不了解职工和农民身体的健康，是顺利开展爱国增产节约运动的重要保证。而要保证身体健康，就必须做好卫生工作。所以增产节约运动和卫生运动是完全应该而且也能够结合进行的。至于时间的矛盾，只要充分发动群众的自觉性和积极性，大家都来想办法，是一定能够克服的。东北某些工厂的经验，完全证明了这一点。在若干农村，卫生运动的开展不仅减少了疾病，增强了劳动力，而且还增加了许多肥料。
    有些卫生工作干部单纯依赖上级和强调客观条件不好，他们只是等待上级派卫生队来，等待足够的设备和经费来解决问题，但却忽略了千百万群众的力量。等待的结果，是卫生工作停滞不前。清洁、扫除、捕鼠、捕蝇等完全可以由群众进行的工作，都被耽误了。
    还有一部分干部，不是把卫生工作看作长期的建设任务，而是看作简单的公事，应付过去就算完事。东北新民县人民政府人员拒绝卫生检查，声明
    “运动已到巩固阶段”。但最后检查的结果，却发现院中牛马粪又累积成堆了。
    有些地方至今不重视卫生的宣传，也影响了运动的开展。如东北的松江日报、西南的川北日报、中南的南方日报、广西日报、江西日报、西北的甘肃日报等报纸，对卫生宣传都没有足够的重视。
    所有上述现象，都说明有些干部至今没有认识到开展爱国卫生运动是反对美帝国主义细菌战的实际行动，是当前我国人民严重的政治任务。针对这些现象，我们必须加强宣传教育工作，使广大干部群众认识这一运动的重大政治意义，认识这一运动和爱国增产节约运动的关系，克服单纯依赖上级和强调客观困难的思想，依靠广大群众，坚持不懈地进行下去，防止运动一过依然如故的现象。在发动群众中，特别要注意发动妇女。因为无论城乡，多数家庭的清洁卫生事务总是由妇女担任的多，她们是搞好个人卫生和环境卫生的主要力量。对于卫生工作落后的地区和单位，要立即采取有效步骤加强这一工作；对于已有成绩的地区和单位，也要随时检查，巩固已得的成绩。
