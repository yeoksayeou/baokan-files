Two War Treaties Threatening European Peace

On May 26th, the U.S., British, and French imperialists and the West German puppet government signed the so-called "General Treaty." On May 27th, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany signed the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty. Both treaties were signed under the duress of the United States. U.S. imperialism is using these two treaties to accelerate the revival of German militarism, divide Germany, and turn West Germany into the military core of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, in preparation for launching a new war of aggression in Europe.

In order to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government, on May 24th, two days before the signing of the "General Treaty," once again submitted new notes to the U.S., Britain, and France, reiterating its proposal to immediately begin discussions on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany. However, the U.S., British, and French governments completely disregarded the Soviet government's peaceful efforts and hastily signed the so-called "General Treaty" with the West German puppet government, attempting to block the path to a peaceful resolution of the German question. The "General Treaty" and the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, which the United States forced its Western European vassal states to sign with West Germany, are entirely treaties for preparing for war. The so-called "General Treaty" and its "Subsidiary Agreements" stipulate the granting of unlimited rights to Western countries to station troops in West Germany; stipulate that West Germany bear all the expenses of the Western occupation forces, the expenses of establishing and maintaining troops within the "European Army" system; and in effect retain the military occupation rights of Western countries in West Germany, keeping West Germany in a state of enslavement. The purpose of the "European Defense Community" treaty, which lasts for fifty years, is to establish a so-called "European Army" under the command of the North Atlantic Military Command, so that twelve divisions of West German Nazi troops can participate in the "European Army" as its backbone. According to the provisions of this treaty, the command of the "European Army" will be directly controlled by the North Atlantic aggressive military headquarters controlled by the United States; that is to say, the national defense sovereignty of the five member states of the "European Defense Community" and West Germany will be handed over to the United States. The signing of these two war treaties will undoubtedly further exacerbate the tension in the European situation.

These war preparations by the United States in Europe have aroused the anger of people in various countries. An unprecedentedly powerful movement protesting the "General Treaty" has unfolded throughout Germany. Mass demonstrations have been held in Berlin, Halle, Rostock, Mecklenburg, and other places in the German Democratic Republic, opposing the "General Treaty" and the European Army treaty, and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany. Protest rallies have also been held in Munich, Nuremberg, and other places in West Germany. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on May 29th, pointing out that the entire French people are extremely angry at the revival of the forces of German revanchists and militarists. Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, expressing support for the German working people's movement against the "General Treaty" and calling on them to fight for shattering this militarist treaty, striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and defending peace in Europe and the world.

### 威胁欧洲和平的两个战争条约

    威胁欧洲和平的两个战争条约
    五月二十六日，美、英、法帝国主义和西德傀儡政府签订了所谓“一般性条约”。五月二十七日法、意、比、荷、卢五国和西德签订了所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。这两个条约都是在美国的高压下签订的。美帝国主义正利用这两个条约加紧复活德国军国主义，分裂德国，把西德变成北大西洋侵略集团的军事核心，以准备在欧洲发动新的侵略战争。
    苏联政府为了争取缔结对德和约，于五月二十四日，即“一般性条约”签订的前两天，又一次向美英法提出新的照会，重申立即开始讨论对德和约问题与统一德国的建议。然而美、英、法政府竟完全不顾苏联政府的和平努力，匆忙地和西德傀儡政府签订了所谓“一般性条约”，企图阻塞和平解决德国问题的道路。美国强迫其西欧附庸国家与西德所签订的“一般性条约”和所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约，完全是准备战争的条约。所谓“一般性条约”及其“附属协定”，规定给予西方国家在西德驻扎军队的无限权利；规定西德担负西方占领军的全部费用，在“欧洲军”的体系下建立军队及维持军队的费用；并在实际上把西方国家在西德的军事占领权保留下来，使西德仍然处于被奴役的地位。而为期五十年的“欧洲防务集团”条约的目的，则是为了在北大西洋军司令部的指挥下建立所谓“欧洲军”，使十二个师的西德纳粹军队参加到“欧洲军”里去作为它的骨干。按照这个条约的规定，“欧洲军”的指挥权将直接掌握在由美国控制的北大西洋侵略军司令部手里；这就是说，“欧洲防务集团”的五个成员国和西德的国防主权都要交给美国。这两个战争条约的签订，无疑地将进一步造成欧洲局势的紧张。
    美国在欧洲的这种备战措施，已激起各国人民的愤怒。抗议“一般性条约”的空前强大的运动已在全德国各地展开。德意志民主共和国的柏林、哈雷、罗斯托克、梅格林堡等地都举行了群众示威，反对“一般性条约”和欧洲军条约，要求缔结对德和约和统一德国。西德的慕尼黑、纽伦堡等地也举行了抗议大会。法国共产党政治局于五月二十九日发表的声明指出：法国全体人民对于复活德国复仇主义者和军国主义者的力量极表愤怒。世界工会联合会总书记赛扬致电自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克，声援德国劳动人民反对“一般性条约”的运动，并号召他们为粉碎这一军国主义条约，争取缔结对德和约，保卫欧洲和世界的和平而斗争。
