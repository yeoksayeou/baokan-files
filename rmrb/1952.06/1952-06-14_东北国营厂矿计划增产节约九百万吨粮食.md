Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 13th: State-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have proposed preliminary targets for increasing production and practicing economy, totaling nine million tons of grain. Judging from the results of mass discussions of plans in various factories and mines, the actual plan will greatly exceed this number.

    After Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government called for increasing production and practicing economy to yield eight million tons of grain, the Northeast enterprise management departments, in order to do a good job in formulating plans, studied the relevant documents on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, summarized the experience of the campaign to increase production and practice economy last year, and analyzed the production situation in the first four months of this year and the various favorable conditions that emerged after the "Three-Anti" movement, thereby identifying the potential for production. After the preliminary plan targets were drafted, the enterprise management departments convened meetings of responsible cadres from their subordinate factories and mines for discussion. The discussion focused on criticizing conservative thinking and complacency, so the plans formulated were all higher than the state's requirements. For example, after the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Industry researched the various new situations in its subordinate factories and mines and the various advanced production experiences that had emerged, it set a plan to increase production and practice economy by 200,000 tons of grain, exceeding the task assigned by the Ministry of Industry by 33 percent. When the Industry Department of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government convened responsible cadres from its subordinate factories and mines to formulate plans, in addition to pointing out the potential capabilities of the factories and mines, it also mobilized everyone to review the conservative thinking that "there is not much potential left" and the bureaucratic work style that ignored the creativity of employees. As a result, a plan was formulated to increase production and practice economy by 400,000 tons of grain, exceeding the tasks assigned by the higher authorities by more than 28 percent.

    At the same time, all units have drafted measures plans to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy. The most common measure is to vigorously promote advanced production experience. The various bureaus of the Ministry of Industry plan to promote more than 50 kinds of advanced production experience within their respective systems. The Local Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government has also formulated plans to promote various advanced experiences in local paper making, grain processing, match making, weaving, oil and other industries. It is estimated that simply by promoting the experience of a certain paper mill in Fushun in speeding up paper copying in the entire Northeast local paper making industry, more than 87,000 tons of grain wealth can be increased and saved in a year. Many measures plans are formulated based on the specific conditions of each factory and mine and key production issues. For example, some factories under the Electrical Industry Bureau must solve the problem of coordinating production in order to increase production, so they formulated plans for mutual coordination of production. The factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have formulated measures plans to ensure product quality and create wealth for the country. The Coal Mine Industry Bureau has formulated plans to adjust labor organization in order to improve the labor productivity of its subordinate factories and mines.

    After the enterprise management departments formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, in order to supervise the thorough implementation of the plans by their subordinate factories and mines, summarize experience, and promote the movement, they organized work teams to go to various places for inspection with a focus. Work teams organized by the Chemical Industry Bureau, the Power Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and the Local Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government have all set off for inspection in mid-May.

    东北国营厂矿计划增产节约九百万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北国营、公营厂矿已提出的增产节约的初步指标总数达九百万吨粮食。如从各厂矿群众讨论计划的结果来看，实际计划还要大大超过此数。
    东北企业管理部门，在东北人民政府高岗主席号召增产节约八百万吨粮食后，为了把制订计划工作做好，都学习了有关开展增产节约运动的文件，总结了去年增产节约运动的经验和分析了今年头四个月的生产情况和经过“三反”运动后出现的各种有利条件，从而找出了生产潜力的所在。初步计划指标拟订后，各企业管理部门又召集所属厂矿负责干部会议进行讨论，讨论中着重批判了保守思想和自满情绪，因此制订的计划都高于国家的要求。如工业部有色金属管理局在研究所属各厂矿各种新的情况和已经出现的各种先进生产经验后，订出了增产节约二十万吨粮食的计划，超过工业部布置任务百分之三十三。辽东省人民政府工业厅，在召集所属厂矿负责干部制订计划时，除指出各厂矿潜在能力所在外，并发动大家检讨了认为“潜力不多了”的保守思想和忽视职工创造的官僚主义作风，结果订出增产节约四十万吨粮食的计划，超过上级布置任务的百分之二十八以上。
    同时，各单位都已拟订了实现增产节约计划的措施计划。最普遍的措施是大力推广先进生产经验。工业部各管理局计划在本系统内推广五十多种先进生产经验。东北人民政府地方工业管理局也订出了在地方造纸、粮米加工、火柴、织布、油脂等工业中分别推广各种先进经验的计划。据计算，仅在全东北地方造纸工业中推广抚顺某造纸厂加快抄纸速度的经验，一年即可增产节约八万七千多吨粮食的财富。许多措施计划，是根据各厂矿具体情况和生产关键问题拟订的。如电器工业管理局某些工厂要增产必须解决配合生产的问题，所以他们就拟订了互相配合生产的计划。鞍山钢铁公司各厂拟订了保证产品质量的措施计划，为国家创造财富。煤矿工业管理局为提高所属各厂矿劳动生产率，制订了调整劳动组织的计划。
    各企业管理部门制订增产节约计划后，为督促所属各厂矿认真贯彻和总结经验，推动运动，都组织了工作组有重点地分赴各地进行检查。工业部化学工业管理局、电业管理局以及东北人民政府地方工业管理局等单位组成的工作组，都已在五月中旬出发进行检查。
