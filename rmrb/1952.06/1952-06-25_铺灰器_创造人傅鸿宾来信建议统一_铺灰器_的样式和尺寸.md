    Fu Hongbin, Creator of the "Ash Spreader," Writes to Suggest Unifying the Style and Size of the "Ash Spreader"
    Comrade Editor: With the continuous education and cultivation from the leadership, based on learning from Su Changyou's advanced experience, I created the "ash spreader." Although this has made a small contribution to the people, it is still far behind the needs of the work. Therefore, I will never be arrogant or complacent, and I guarantee to continue to work hard and use my brains, learn humbly, and play a backbone role in my work in order to create more wealth for the people. Now, in some places, the inconsistent appearance and form of the "ash spreader" affects the work. Therefore, I suggest that the appearance, form, and size of the "ash spreader" be uniformly specified to facilitate use in various places. I don't know if my suggestion is correct, please consider it. Fu Hongbin

    “铺灰器”创造人傅鸿宾来信
    建议统一“铺灰器”的样式和尺寸
    编辑同志：我在学习苏长有先进经验基础上，由于领导方面的不断教育和培养，创造了“铺灰器”。这虽然对人民有一点点贡献，但还远远落后于工作的需要。因此，我决不骄不傲，保证再接再厉开动脑筋，虚心学习，在工作中起骨干作用，以便为人民创造更多的财富。现在有些地方，因为“铺灰器”的样子形式不一致，而影响了工作。因此，我建议把“铺灰器”的样子、形式、尺寸统一规定，以便于各地使用。我的建议不知是否正确，请有关方面考虑。　傅鸿宾
