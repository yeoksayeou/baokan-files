    Introducing the Central Institute for Nationalities
    Central Institute for Nationalities Correspondence Group
    The Central Institute for Nationalities has been established for a year now. When this institute was founded on June 11, 1951, it only had the military and political cadre training class and the Tibetan language group of the Chinese Language Department, and it was of a pilot nature. Now, the school has developed greatly compared to its initial establishment. The first class of students in the military and political cadre training class has graduated; the Chinese Language Department has added seven ethnic minority languages; the Research Department and the Nationalities Art Troupe have been established; and the Mongolian-Tibetan School has been merged into the affiliated middle school. Recently, the Political Science Department will be opened, efforts will be made to strengthen the Research Department and the Art Troupe, and preparations will be made to expand the school buildings. In this year, students from thirty-four ethnic groups have gathered here and are studying happily.
    The tasks of the Central Institute for Nationalities, as stipulated by the Government Administration Council, are: 1. To train senior and middle-level cadres for the implementation of regional autonomy for ethnic minorities and the development of political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings of ethnic minorities. 2. To study Chinese ethnic minority issues, as well as the languages, scripts, history, culture, and social economy of various ethnic minorities, and to promote and introduce the excellent historical culture of various ethnic groups. 3. To organize and lead the editing and translation work related to ethnic minorities.
    These tasks are important and urgent. Because the founding of the People's Republic of China fundamentally eliminated the ethnic oppression system of successive reactionary ruling classes, realized ethnic equality and unity, and established a loving and cooperative family, various ethnic minorities, encouraged by Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, have universally put forward the demand to develop political, economic, and cultural and educational construction undertakings. The need for ethnic minority cadres has become increasingly urgent. Universally and massively training cadres of various ethnic minorities themselves has become the central link in promoting all ethnic work. In order to shoulder its glorious mission, the Central Institute for Nationalities hastily started school after only a short period of preparation, under conditions of lack of teachers, lack of equipment, and lack of work experience. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the higher authorities, the efforts of the staff, and the enthusiasm of the students, they finally overcame various difficulties and achieved the results they have today.
    The military and political cadre training class has the nature of a short-term political training class. After graduation, students will return to their ethnic regions to participate in work. Therefore, the task of this training class is to cultivate and strengthen students' patriotism and concept of the motherland in a short period, while enabling them to understand ethnic policies and ethnic issues, and to establish a life outlook of serving the people. In order to achieve this goal, the training class stipulates nine required courses: A Brief History of China, Chinese Situation, Ethnic Policies and Ethnic Issues, Common Program, Communist Party of China, Chinese People's Liberation Army, History of Social Development, Revolutionary Outlook on Life, and Current Affairs and Politics. The content of the lectures mainly introduces the situation of the great motherland in various aspects and the history of revolutionary struggle; explains the ethnic policies in the Common Program; and at the same time, explains the position, viewpoints, morals, qualities that a revolutionary worker should possess, and how to cultivate oneself.
    Due to the special circumstances of the students of the Institute for Nationalities, the teaching methods are also slightly different from those of ordinary schools. One of the urgent wishes of students from various ethnic minorities who come to Beijing to study is to see the central leaders. Therefore, inviting responsible comrades from the central government to meet with students and give reports to students is the greatest encouragement for the students and can most enlighten the students' revolutionary consciousness. In lecturing, adopting the method of first talking about the situation and history, and then talking about basic knowledge and policies, from concrete to abstract, and from the present to the history, is most suitable for the students' requirements and is easy to be effective. Combining classroom learning with extracurricular activities is also very necessary. The primary task here is to make students earnestly participate in important political movements. For example, students participated in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Defend World Peace, which improved their patriotic consciousness, deepened their hatred of U.S. imperialism, and recognized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of all ethnic groups in China, all oppressed nations in the world, and all peace-loving people. Therefore, all the students actively participated in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and signed the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty. Another example is participating in the movements to suppress counter-revolutionaries, review cadres, and the "Three-Anti" campaign, which not only distinguished between the enemy and ourselves and recognized the harm of bourgeois ideology, but also further transformed their own thinking. In addition, the Central Institute for Nationalities also organizes students to visit, tour, and participate in various commemorative festivals. After visiting the mechanized farm, many students said, "Our ethnic group will also build such a farm in the future." After visiting the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition held in Tianjin, the students said, "Our motherland has everything, it is so great, we are not afraid of any imperialism." When visiting factories, they said, "Now we see that the worker brothers are really progressive, and we further understand the truth that the revolution must be led by the working class."
    Due to the language barriers and uneven cultural level of the students, there are many difficulties in teaching. Therefore, the counselor must adopt various methods and languages of various ethnic groups to repeat each lesson according to the special circumstances of the students. At the same time, when teachers cannot use the languages of various ethnic groups to teach, it is very necessary to strengthen mutual assistance among students of the same ethnic group. The Central Institute for Nationalities adopted these methods and solved many difficulties in teaching.
    After eight months of study, the students of the military and political cadre training class have significantly improved their patriotic consciousness and have gained certain basic political common sense. They personally feel the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's ethnic policies, strengthened their confidence in ethnic equality and unity, and stimulated their courage and determination to seek progress. Now the first class of students has graduated and returned to their ethnic regions to participate in work. They often write letters back to the institute, reporting various encouraging situations in their hometowns, their confidence in their work, and their nostalgic feelings for Chairman Mao and the people's capital.
    In order to train cadres who are proficient in both Chinese and ethnic minority languages for translation, research, and publicity work, the Central Institute for Nationalities established the Chinese Language Department. Last June, 34 Han students who volunteered to work for ethnic minorities and had graduated from high school or above were recruited, and the Tibetan language group of the Chinese Language Department was established first to study Tibetan language and script. With the assistance of the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University, this group has made considerable progress in its studies.
    The Tibetan language has a script, and it is a phonetic script. However, because the original letters do not express certain pronunciations and tones, and the text written with these letters is very different from the common language, students who are new to Tibetan language have great difficulties if they start with Tibetan script. For the convenience of learning, the Central Institute for Nationalities has adopted a set of phonetic symbols as a tool for learning the language. This set of symbols can achieve 95% accuracy in pronunciation and 80% accuracy in tones when expressing Lhasa Tibetan.
    The teaching process of the Tibetan language group can be divided into three stages in the past year.
    1. Mastering the phonetic symbols of the language learning tool and learning simple conversations. The purpose of learning phonetic symbols is to practice correct pronunciation and to be able to record what you hear according to the tone. After students have a preliminary understanding of phonetic symbols, they combine them with simple conversations in life and practice repeatedly until they can pronounce and record sounds accurately.
    2. Exercising the ability to listen and speak to make them proficient. In this stage, the teachers tell stories in class, talk to the students more outside the classroom, and further organize the students to talk to each other in Tibetan.
    3. Learning Tibetan script. This is divided into two steps: The first step is to learn Tibetan letters and use Tibetan letters to spell Tibetan, which is equivalent to colloquial Chinese in Chinese. The second step is to learn the currently popular "literary language" and classics in Tibet from simple to deep. Now the Tibetan language group can select and read simple and accessible popular literary language.
    The correct learning method from tones to conversation, from language to script, from "writing words" to "literary language", coupled with the students' high political awareness, their ability to regard learning as a political task, and their love for the Tibetan people, has resulted in great learning achievements.
    After gaining initial experience from the Tibetan language group, the Chinese Language Department began to prepare for the establishment of seven language groups: Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Naxi, Zhuang, Zhongjia (Buyi), and Yao. Except for the Uyghur language, the rest need to determine the phonetic symbols first before learning can be carried out. During the preparation period, we received assistance from the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which compiled phonetic symbols and trial textbooks for various dialects, a total of thirteen types. In order to train teachers, students of various ethnic groups were selected from the military and political cadre training class, and the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences taught them to learn new symbols and participate in compiling textbooks. These teachers in training, encouraged by the ethnic policies in the Common Program, worked day and night under the guidance of experts and finally completed the task as planned. In February of this year, these seven (thirteen groups) ethnic language groups began classes.
    The students studying these seven ethnic minority languages were transferred from various universities, a total of 65, mainly Han Chinese. After arriving at the school, they first went through political study and attached importance to their tasks ideologically. There was also the experience of the Tibetan language group in learning methods, so the progress was faster. After four months of study, most of them have been able to have simple conversations in the ethnic minority languages they have learned. When ethnic minority visiting delegations from the Southwest came to visit the Central Institute for Nationalities, the students used various ethnic minority languages to talk to them.
    The Central Institute for Nationalities itself is a big family of nationalities. In the past year, students from 34 ethnic groups have gathered together. This reflects the new relationship of friendship and cooperation between the people of all ethnic groups. The Central Institute for Nationalities not only trains cadres who can implement ethnic policies, but is itself a concrete practice of ethnic policies. Therefore, all the facilities of the school must start from ethnic policies.
    The religious beliefs and customs of all ethnic groups are respected. Students who believe in Islam have their own rooms in the dormitory for daily worship and can go to the mosque for worship every week. Their dietary habits are different from those of other ethnic groups, so they have their own cafeteria; special care is also given during "fasting." Various ethnic groups have different ethnic festivals, and the school helps them to organize festival activities in their own ethnic forms and welcomes students from other ethnic groups to participate. Students are free to wear their ethnic costumes. In addition to the ordinary uniforms, the school also has ethnic costumes. Students reflect: "Chairman Mao is more considerate to us than our own parents."
    Students' recreational activities also try to promote their ethnic characteristics. After class, you can often see them dancing various ethnic dances and singing various ethnic songs. Moreover, through you teaching me and I teaching you, students of various ethnic groups learn from each other, which strengthens cultural exchanges between ethnic groups. After they return to their hometowns, they will also bring back the excellent art of various ethnic groups.
    What students are most interested in is the get-together with students from various schools and workers from various factories. This kind of get-together is held frequently, and they are warmly welcomed everywhere. When visiting Tianjin, the students of Nankai University gave their beds to them to sleep and let them eat first. They sang "Unity is Strength" until their throats were hoarse. They said after they came back, "The big family is really warm. Who looked up to us before! Now Chairman Mao has educated everyone, we are closer than our own brothers."
    Because the Central Institute for Nationalities embodies the spirit of ethnic equality and unity, the representatives of ethnic minorities who come to Beijing to visit say: "This is our home." Ethnic minorities in various places care about it and hope that it will grow faster and train more and better cadres to serve them.

    介绍中央民族学院
    中央民族学院通讯组
    中央民族学院成立迄今已经一年了。当一九五一年六月十一日这个学院成立的时候，还只有军政干部训练班和语文系的藏文组，而且带有试办的性质。现在，学校比初成立时已有了很大的发展。军政干部训练班第一期学员已经毕业；语文系增加了七种民族语言；研究部和民族文工团都已建立起来；合并了蒙藏学校为附属中学。最近将开办政治系，着手加强研究部和文工团，并准备扩充校舍。在这一年中，有三十四个民族的学生聚集在这里，愉快地学习。
    政务院所规定的中央民族学院的任务是：一、为国内各少数民族实行区域自治以及发展各少数民族的政治、经济、文化建设事业培养高级和中级的干部。二、研究中国少数民族问题，以及各少数民族的语言文字、历史文化、社会经济，发扬并介绍各民族的优良历史文化。三、组织和领导关于少数民族方面的编辑和翻译工作。
    这些任务是重大而迫切的。因为中华人民共和国的成立，根本消灭了历代反动统治阶级的民族压迫制度，实现了民族平等和团结，建立起友爱合作的大家庭，各少数民族在毛主席的民族政策鼓舞下，普遍提出了发展政治、经济和文化教育建设事业的要求。少数民族干部的需要随之日见迫切。普遍地和大量地培养各少数民族自己的干部，已成为推行一切民族工作的中心环节。中央民族学院为了担负起自己的光荣任务，只经过短期的筹备，便在缺乏教师、缺乏设备和缺乏工作经验的条件下，匆匆开学了。但是，由于上级的正确领导，工作人员的努力和学生的热情，终于克服了种种困难，获得了今天这样的成绩。
    军政干部训练班有短期政治训练班的性质，学生毕业以后就要回到本民族地区参加工作。因此，这个训练班的任务是在短期间内培养和加强学生的爱国主义思想和祖国观念，同时使他们了解民族政策和民族问题，并建立为人民服务的人生观。为了达到这个目的，训练班规定了九种必修课程：中国简史，中国情况，民族政策及民族问题，共同纲领，中国共产党，中国人民解放军，社会发展史，革命人生观和时事政治。讲课内容，主要是介绍伟大祖国各方面的情况和革命斗争的历史；讲解共同纲领中的民族政策；同时要说明一个革命工作者应具有的立场、观点、道德、品质及如何修养的问题。
    由于民族学院学生情况特殊，教学方法也和一般学校略有区别。各少数民族学生来北京学习，其迫切愿望之一是要见到中央首长。因此，请中央负责同志和学生见面并给学生做报告，对学生的鼓励最大，也最能启发学生的革命觉悟。在讲课时，采用先讲情况、历史，后讲基础知识和政策，从具体到抽象，从现状到历史的讲法，最适合于学生的要求，也容易生效。课堂学习和课外活动相结合，也是非常必要的。这里首要的是使学生认真参加重要的政治运动。例如学生参加了抗美援朝和保卫世界和平的运动，就提高了爱国主义觉悟，加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨，认识了美帝国主义是中国各民族、世界各被压迫民族和一切和平人民的共同敌人。因而，全体学生踊跃地参加了支援中国人民志愿军的捐献飞机大炮运动，并在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。又如参加了镇压反革命、审干、“三反”等运动，不但划清了敌我界限，认识了资产阶级思想的危害性，而且使自己的思想得到了进一步的改造。此外，中央民族学院还组织学生参观、游览和参加各纪念节日的活动。参观了机耕农场后，很多学生说：“将来我们民族也要建设这样的农场。”参观了在天津举行的华北区城乡物资交流展览会，学生们说：“我们祖国什么都有，真伟大，什么帝国主义都不怕。”参观工厂时说：“现在才看到工人兄弟们真进步，进一步明白了革命必须由工人阶级来领导的道理。”
    由于学生的民族语言的隔阂和文化水平的不齐，在教学上有很多困难。因此，必须由辅导员根据学生的特殊情况，采取各种方式和各民族的语言复讲各课。同时，在教员还不能用各民族语言讲课时，加强同民族学生间的互助，是非常必要的。中央民族学院采用了这些办法，解决了教学上的不少困难。
    军政干部训练班的学生经过八个月的学习，爱国主义觉悟有了显著提高，并且获得了一定的基本政治常识。他们亲身感觉到毛主席和中央人民政府的民族政策的伟大、正确，加强了民族平等团结的信心，激发了求进步的勇气和决心。现在第一期学生已经毕业，回到本民族地区参加工作了。他们经常写信回院，报告他们家乡的各种令人鼓舞的情况、自己对工作的信心以及对毛主席和人民首都的怀念心情。
    为培养能兼通汉族语文和少数民族语文的干部，以担任翻译、研究和宣传工作，中央民族学院成立了语文系。去年六月招收高中毕业以上的志愿作少数民族工作的汉族学生三十四名，首先成立了语文系的藏语组，学习藏语藏文。在北京大学东方语文系的协助下，这个组的学习已取得相当成绩。
    藏族是有文字的，而且是拼音文字。但因原有字母并不表达一定的发音和声调，而且用这些字母写成的文字和普通语言有很大距离，所以初学藏语的学生如果从藏文入手，就有很大困难。为了学习方便，中央民族学院采用了一套记音符号作为学习语言的工具。这套符号在表达拉萨藏语时，发音上可以达到百分之九十五的正确性，声调上可以达到百分之八十的正确性。
    藏语组的教学过程，在过去一年中可分为三个阶段。
    一、掌握学习语言工具的记音符号及学会简单会话。学习记音符号的目的是练习正确的发音，并能把听到的话按音调记录下来。学生在初步认识音符后，就结合生活中的简单会话，反复练习，达到能准确地发音和记音。
    二、锻炼听和说的能力使之熟练。在这个阶段中，教员在课堂上讲故事，在课堂外多和学生谈话，进一步组织学生相互间用藏语交谈。
    三、学习藏文。这分两个步骤：第一步是学藏文字母，用藏文字母来拼写藏语，这种拼写出来的藏语，相当于汉文中的白话文。第二步，由浅入深，学习现在西藏通行的“文言”和经典。现在藏语组已能选读浅近的通行文言。
    从音调到会话、从语言到文字、从“写话”到“文言”的正确学习方法，加上学生们政治觉悟较高，能把学习当成政治任务，并热爱藏族人民，所以学习成绩较大。
    从藏语组取得初步经验后，语文系就开始筹备成立维吾尔、苗、彝、纳喜、僮、仲家（布伊）、瑶等七种语言组。除维吾尔语文外，其余都需要先定出记音符号，然后才能进行学习。在筹备期间，得到了中国科学院语言研究所的帮助，依各族方言，编定了记音符号和试用课本，共十三种。为了培养教员，从军政干部训练班中选调了各族学生，由中国科学院语言研究所教他们学会新符号，并参加编定课本。这些培养中的教员，受着共同纲领中的民族政策的鼓舞，日以继夜地在专家们的指导下，努力学习，终于按计划完成了任务。今年二月，这七种（十三组）民族语言组开始上课了。
    学习这七种民族语言的学生是从各大学调来的，共六十五名，主要是汉族。他们到校后，先经过政治学习，从思想上重视了他们的任务。学习方法上又有藏语组的经验，所以进步较快。经过四个月的学习，大部分已经能用所学的民族语言作简单会话。西南各民族参观团到中央民族学院参观时，学生们都用各民族的语言和他们谈话。
    中央民族学院本身就是一个民族大家庭。过去一年中，已经有三十四个民族的学生聚在一堂。这里反映了各民族人民间友爱合作的新关系。中央民族学院不但要培养能执行民族政策的干部，而且本身就是民族政策的具体实践。因此，学校的一切设施，都必须从民族政策出发。
    各民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，都受到尊重。信奉伊斯兰教的学生，宿舍里有他们的专用房间，以便于日常的礼拜，并可以每周去清真寺礼拜。他们的饮食习惯和其他民族不同，所以设有专用的食堂；“把斋”时也得到特殊的照顾。各民族有不同的民族节日，学校就帮助他们分别组织自己民族形式的过节活动，并欢迎其他民族的学生参加。学生们可以自由穿着他们民族的服装。学校除供给普通制服外，并备有民族服装。学生们反映：“毛主席对我们比亲生父母更体贴。”
    学生们的文娱活动，也尽量发扬他们的民族特点。在课后，经常可以看到他们跳着各种民族舞蹈，唱着各种民族歌曲。而且经过你教我、我教你、各民族学生间互相学习，更加强了民族间的文化交流。他们回到家乡后，也就会把各民族优秀的艺术带回去。
    学生们最感兴趣的，是和各学校的学生、各工厂的工人们联欢。这种联欢会经常举行，他们到处受到热烈的欢迎。到天津参观时，南开大学的学生们把自己的床让给他们睡，把饭让给他们先吃。他们高唱“团结就是力量”，把嗓子都喊哑了。他们回来以后说：“大家庭真是温暖。以前谁看得起我们！现在毛主席教育了大家，我们比亲兄弟还亲热。”
    由于中央民族学院体现了民族的平等、团结的精神，因而少数民族来京参观的代表们说：“这是我们的家。”各地少数民族都关心它，希望它更快地成长，从这里培养出更多更好的为他们服务的干部。
