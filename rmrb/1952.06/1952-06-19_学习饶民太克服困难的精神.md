    Learning from Rao Mintai's Spirit of Overcoming Difficulties

    In the face of a difficult task, what attitude should a Communist Party member adopt, and what methods should they use to overcome difficulties? Rao Mintai's actions provide a vivid example.

    For Rao Mintai, who did not understand technology, completing the construction of a dam in a very short period of time was indeed a very difficult task. Faced with such a difficult task, he was not afraid at all. He believed that being able to accept such a task was an honor, and therefore he greeted the task with an indomitable and determined attitude. When the engineering situation was critical, and it required him to disregard his own life in order to reverse the situation, Rao Mintai did not hesitate to be the first to jump onto the turbulent boat, bravely shouting: "For the sake of tens of millions of people, I will take the risk first." His efforts received the support of the masses, and thus he achieved brilliant results. This excellent Bolshevik quality is the real reason why he was able to complete the breaching task in seven days and eight nights.

    There are many comrades like Rao Mintai in our Party. However, some comrades are often timid and fearful in the face of difficulties, even panicking, showing the shameful wavering of the petty bourgeoisie. Some comrades are full of complaints in the face of difficult tasks, moaning and groaning, unable to do even the slightest thing, yet boasting and promoting themselves everywhere, afraid that others will not know about their little achievements. After reading this article about Rao Mintai, such comrades should be vigilant and strive to overcome their wavering, otherwise, they cannot become good Communist Party members.

    The reason why Rao Mintai was able to complete the seemingly impossible task was also because he adopted the mass line method to overcome the many difficulties on the road forward. In this way, he closely integrated the spirit of the communist cause with scientific working methods. His mass line method is not only manifested in truly integrating with the people, carrying soil and digging soil with the peasants, and eating with them; but also in his ability to educate peasants, unite technicians, and summarize the experiences of the masses. After he did this, he truly realized the belief that "in front of a Communist Party member, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome."

    Now, we are preparing for large-scale economic construction, and a large number of Party cadres have already taken and will take on economic work posts. At this time, it is very beneficial for us to learn from Rao Mintai's attitude and methods in dealing with difficulties.

    学习饶民太克服困难的精神
    在困难的任务面前，一个共产党员究竟应该采取什么态度，用什么方法去克服困难？饶民太的行动提供了一个活的榜样。
    对于不懂技术的饶民太来说，在很短的时间内完成一道拦河坝的修建工程，的确是一个十分艰难的任务。对于这样艰难的任务，他毫不畏惧，他认为能够接受这样的任务是光荣的，因而以百折不挠的坚毅态度，迎接了这个任务。而在工程情况危急，需要他不顾自己的生命以扭转这种情况的时候，饶民太毫不犹豫地第一个跳到颠簸的船上，英勇地呼喊着：“为了几千万人民，有危险我先当。”他的努力得到了群众的支持，因而获得了光辉的成果。这种布尔什维克的优秀品格，正是他能够在七天八夜的时间内，完成堵口任务的真正原因。
    像饶民太这样的同志，在我们党内是很多的。但是，也有些同志，在困难面前常常畏首畏尾，甚至惊慌失措，表现了那种小资产阶级的可耻的动摇性。有的同志则在困难的任务面前牢骚满腹，叫苦连天，作不了一点点事情，就到处吹嘘，自我宣扬，生恐别人不知道他的那点点成绩。这样的同志在读了关于饶民太的这篇通讯以后，应该知所警惕，努力克服自己的动摇性，否则，他们是不能成为一个好的共产党员的。
    饶民太所以能够完成那看来不易完成的任务，还在于他采取了群众路线的方法，战胜了前进道路上的重重困难。这样，他就把共产主义的事业精神和科学的工作方法紧密地结合了起来。他的群众路线的方法，不仅表现在真正和人民群众打成一片，和农民一块挑土、挖土、一块吃饭；而且表现在他善于教育农民，善于团结技术人员，善于总结群众经验。在他这样作了以后，就真正实现了“在共产党员面前，没有克服不了的困难”的信念。
    现在，我们正为大规模的经济建设作准备，已经有并且还会有大批党员干部走上经济工作岗位，在这样的时候，我们来学习饶民太对待困难的态度和方法，是很有益的。
