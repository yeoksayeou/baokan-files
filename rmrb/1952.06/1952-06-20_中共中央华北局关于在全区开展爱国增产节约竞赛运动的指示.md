    The "Three-Anti" movement in all counties and above throughout the North China region and the "Five-Anti" movement in major and medium-sized cities have victoriously concluded. The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have cleared the way for the country's upcoming large-scale economic construction and have prepared ample favorable conditions in all aspects. At present, the overriding central task facing the entire Party and all levels of the People's Government is to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural production and broadly promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas on the basis of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, so as to strengthen economic construction.

    The core of economic construction is industrial construction. Therefore, it is completely necessary and possible to organize a region-wide patriotic production increase and economy drive at this time. This is an important link in developing industrial production and thus driving comprehensive economic construction.

    According to the tasks of the national plan, state-owned and public industrial and mining enterprises in the North China region will strive to complete and exceed the total target of 4 trillion yuan in production increase and economy in four main areas: increasing production, reducing costs, saving working capital, and strengthening capital construction. The great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the working class's high patriotic enthusiasm for production, the powerful coordination and support of the agricultural production competition movement, and the past experience in organizing industrial production competition movements are all favorable conditions for completing and striving to exceed this year's production increase and economy tasks. There are also some difficulties at present, such as sluggish economy, product backlog, and poor supply and marketing, but these are temporary difficulties in the course of victorious advance and can be and certainly will be gradually overcome. It is necessary to soberly assess the conditions in all aspects, carefully organize the competition movement in accordance with the specific circumstances of each department, and formulate planned targets for each department, workshop, group, machine tool, various products, and quantities, quality, and costs, and strive to overfulfill the plan.

    To lead, plan, and take step to promote advanced production experience, and to strengthen leadership over the movement is the most important key issue in organizing the competition. To this end, it is necessary to attach importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in various related aspects, universally mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, and promptly organize and promote experiences of universal significance, vigorously support workers' and staff's rationalization proposals; it is necessary to implement new reforms in production management, conduct investigation and determination work and cost management work, establish and improve various scientific systems, and strengthen the organization and planning in production management; always pay attention to security work, rewards work, and workers' and staff's welfare. In terms of leadership, organize and strengthen the production increase and economy competition committees at all levels, give full play to the role of various organizations such as the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League under highly unified and truly efficient leadership, implement a full mass line, and at the same time strengthen political and ideological leadership, and resolutely struggle against all backward conservative ideas and capitalist ideas and all bureaucratic phenomena that hinder the progress of the movement; on the other hand, it is also necessary to resolutely struggle against all destructive activities that are hostile to the interests of the people, in order to protect the safe conduct of the competition movement.

    The provincial and municipal Party committees should immediately place the specific organization of the competition movement in an important position in their current work; call on all Communist Party members, labor models, Communist Youth League members, trade union members, and all workers and staff in all industrial and mining enterprises to fight for the victorious completion and surpassing of the four trillion yuan of wealth produced and saved for the country, for laying the foundation for economic accounting, for preparing for large-scale national economic construction on this basis, and for further improving the lives of workers and staff.

    中共中央华北局关于在全区开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动的指示
    华北全区县以上的“三反”运动和各大中城市的“五反”运动业已胜利结束。伟大的“三反”、
    “五反”运动为国家行将到来的大规模的经济建设扫清了道路，并在各方面准备了充分的有利条件。目前摆在全党和各级人民政府面前压倒一切的中心任务，是在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的基础上，全力发展工农业生产，广泛促进城乡物资交流工作，以加强经济建设工作。
    经济建设的中心是工业建设，因此，在目前组织一个全区规模的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，是完全必要和完全可能的，这是发展工业生产从而带动全面经济建设的重要环节。
    根据国家计划的任务，今年华北全区国营和公营工矿企业，将在增加生产、降低成本、节约流动资金和加强基本建设等四个主要方面，为完成并超过增产节约四万亿元的总任务而奋斗。“三反”、“五反”运动的伟大成果，工人阶级的高度爱国生产热情，农业生产竞赛运动的有力配合和支援，以及过去组织工业生产竞赛运动的经验，这些就是完成并争取超过今年增产节约任务的有利条件；目前也有若干困难，比如某些经济呆滞、产品积压、供销不畅等等，但这些都是胜利前进中的暂时的困难，是完全可以并且一定能够逐步克服的。必须清醒地估计到各方面的条件，将竞赛运动按照各个部门的具体情况加以周密的组织，制定各部门、车间、小组、机台、各种产品及数量、质量和成本等计划指标，争取超额完成计划。
    有领导有计划有步骤地推广先进生产经验，加强对运动的领导，是组织竞赛中最主要的关键问题。为此，必须重视学习苏联各项有关的先进经验，普遍发动广大职工的创造性、积极性，并及时地组织推广具有普遍意义的经验，大力支持职工的合理化建议；必须在生产管理上实行新的改革，进行查定工作和成本管理工作，建立与健全各项科学制度，加强生产管理中的组织性和计划性；时刻注意保安工作、奖励工作和职工福利。在领导方面，组织并加强各级的增产节约竞赛委员会，在高度统一的真正有效率的领导下，发挥党、行政、工会、青年团等各种组织的作用，实行充分的群众路线，同时加强政治思想领导，对一切落后的障碍运动前进的保守思想和资本主义思想及一切官僚主义现象作坚决斗争；另一方面又必须对各种敌视人民利益的破坏活动作坚决斗争，以保卫竞赛运动的安全进行。
    各省委、市委应即把具体组织竞赛运动放到当前工作的重要地位；号召各工矿企业中的所有共产党员、劳动模范、青年团员、工会会员以及全体职工同志们，为胜利地完成并超过为国家增产节约四万亿元的财富，为打下经济核算制的基础，为在这个基础上准备国家大规模经济建设，并进一步改善职工生活而斗争。六月十四日
