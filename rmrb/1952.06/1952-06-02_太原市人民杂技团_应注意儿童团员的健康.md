    Taiyuan People's Acrobatic Troupe
    Should Pay Attention to the Health of Child Performers
    Editor: On the evening of "May Day" Labor Day, the Taiyuan People's Acrobatic Troupe performed acrobatics at the People's Theater in Wu'an County. One act was: A young woman, hooking a suspended tray with her toes, her head hanging down, biting a rope in her mouth. The other end of the rope was tied to a child under ten years old. The young woman twisted the child with her hands, turning him like a flywheel, for five minutes. After the performance, the child stumbled several times before barely standing firm. I believe this is a very barbaric performance that will affect the physical and mental health of children. I hope relevant departments will pay attention to it.

    Editor's Note: All theater troupes and acrobatic troupes should pay attention to protecting the health of child performers. This newspaper's reader, Comrade Wang Baolin, raised this issue two months ago (published in the "Reader's Letters" column of this newspaper on March 4th); and on November 29th of last year, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government had already proposed handling measures for this issue to cultural and educational departments in various regions (see "Reply from the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture to Comrade Wang Baolin's Opinions" in the "Reader's Letters" column of this newspaper on March 4th). This issue should be given attention by cultural and educational departments, circuses, and acrobatic troupes in various regions.

### 太原市人民杂技团  应注意儿童团员的健康

    太原市人民杂技团
    应注意儿童团员的健康
    编辑同志：“五一”劳动节晚上，太原市人民杂技团在武安县人民剧院演出杂技。有一场演的是：一个青年女子，足尖钩着空悬的套盘，头下垂，嘴里咬着一条绳子，绳子的另一头捆着一个不满十岁的儿童。这个青年女子用手扭转儿童，转得好像飞轮一样，转了五分钟之久。这个儿童在表演之后，连跌了几跤，才勉强站稳。我认为这是一种非常野蛮的表演，会影响儿童的身心健康，希望有关部门予以注意。                                   　宋作均
    编者按：所有剧团和杂技团应该注意保护儿童艺人的健康。本报读者王保林同志在两个月以前就提出了这个问题（载三月四日本报“读者来信”栏）；而在去年十一月二十九日，中央人民政府文化部已向各地文教部门提出了这个问题的处理办法（见三月四日本报“读者来信”栏“中央文化部艺术事业管理局对王保林同志意见的答复”）。这个问题应该引起各地文教部门、马戏团和杂技团的重视。
