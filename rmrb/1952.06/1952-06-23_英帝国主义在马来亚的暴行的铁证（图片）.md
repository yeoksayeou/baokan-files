    Ironclad Evidence of British Imperialist Atrocities in Malaya

    This is a photograph originally published in the British "Daily Worker" on April 28th. The group of people in the photo, gleefully holding human heads, are none other than the British troops who claim to be "civilized" and "free" while engaging in barbaric acts of murder in Malaya. What they are holding are the heads of Malayan patriotic fighters who fought valiantly for national independence.

    In its war of plunder in Malaya, British imperialism has used every despicable and malicious means, from jet planes and rocket launchers to spraying chemical poisons to destroy crops in areas occupied by Malayan people's armed forces. Like the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea, the British invaders have also adopted horrific, bloody means of slaughter to deal with Malayan patriotic fighters. This photograph is ironclad evidence of the atrocities of the British imperialists.

    The people of the world must rise up to stop such barbaric crimes by imperialism and allow every nation to achieve independence and freedom. The blood debts owed to the people of all nations by the imperialist aggressors must be repaid, and they must be subjected to the just sanctions of the people of the world!

    英帝国主义在马来亚的暴行的铁证
    这是一张原来刊载在四月二十八日英国“工人日报”上的照片。照片里提着人头洋洋得意的一群，就是那些自称“文明”、
    “自由”而在马来亚干着野蛮的杀人勾当的英国军队；他们手里提着的是为争取民族独立而英勇战斗的马来亚爱国志士的头颅。
    英帝国主义在马来亚的掠夺战争中使用了一切卑鄙恶毒的手段，从喷气飞机、火箭炮直到在马来亚人民武装占领地区的上空撒布毁灭谷物的化学毒品。和美国侵略军在朝鲜的暴行一样，英国侵略者也采用了恐怖的血腥屠杀手段来对付马来亚的爱国志士。这张照片就是英帝国主义者的暴行的铁证。
    世界人民必须起来制止帝国主义这种野蛮的罪行，让每一个民族都能得到独立和自由。帝国主义侵略者对各族人民欠下的血债必须偿还，他们必须受到全世界人民的正义制裁！
