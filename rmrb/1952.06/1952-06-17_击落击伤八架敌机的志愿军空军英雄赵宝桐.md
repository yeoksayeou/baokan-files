In the command room of a field airport in Korea, the commander was at his desk drafting a telegram:

	"...During the brief period of air combat, many heroes emerged from our unit. Among them, pilot Comrade Zhao Baotong has shot down six enemy aircraft and damaged two, totaling eight enemy aircraft shot down and damaged..."

As the commander wrote, he thought: he was not only writing a combat telegram to his superiors, but he seemed to be reporting to the Korean people, the people of the motherland, and all peace-loving people around the world that the young Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force was rapidly growing in the fight against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. When he wrote the name Zhao Baotong, he thought of these young pilots who, nurtured by the Party and the people, were gradually becoming eagles capable of overcoming storms. "How difficult it was for a child who herded pigs, a lathe worker, to quickly master advanced flying skills and grow in battle."

Zhao Baotong is only twenty-five years old this year, from Fushun, Northeast China, and a member of the Communist Party. When he was very young, his family's few acres of land were seized by the landlord because his grandfather couldn't pay the rent. From then on, he and his grandfather worked for the landlord. He herded pigs for the landlord. Later, he went to a factory in Fushun to learn lathe work. It wasn't until after the "August 15th" liberation of Northeast China by the Soviet Red Army that he was liberated.

Since joining the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, Zhao Baotong and his comrades have been constantly striking at the enemy in the air. He and his comrades all love their motherland and the Korean people, and have boundless hatred for the heinous American imperialists. A burning heart prompts them to bravely realize their determination. Here, we will only describe the circumstances of his first air combat in which he shot down two enemy aircraft.

That was on November 4, 1951:

The sky sparkled with fading morning stars, and the sound of motorcycles was already heard at the airport. The mechanics got up earlier than the sun, and they had already prepared the planes. When Zhao Baotong and his comrades jumped out of the car and ran into the cockpit, the morning glow reddened the silvery-white "Little Swallows." The mechanics checked the plane again, the ordnance men filled it with shells, and they surrounded the cockpit and said to Zhao Baotong:

	"Look, the weather is so good today, you're sure to hit something, I wish you shoot down enemy planes today!"

	"Press the cannon button a few more times when you see enemy planes, and fire a few shots for us too!"

These words deeply touched Zhao Baotong's heart. The ground crew got up with the stars and went to bed with the moon, squatting under the wings day and night, checking the planes, troubleshooting, and ensuring flight. Logistics personnel, political staff, staff officers, were all busy day and night, with one purpose: to shoot down enemy planes! Not to mention the strong support of the people of the whole country. Zhao Baotong had participated in several air battles, and the aerial warriors of brother units had shot down many enemy planes, but their squadron had not yet shot down any enemy planes. Were they not brave enough? No, that's not the case at all, they are very brave.

Once the commander asked them:

	"Comrades! The enemies are all cunning and slippery pilots, old robbers, are you confident to shoot them down?"

Zhao Baotong said: "Don't think these enemies have been flying for a long time, but they are afraid of death, I'll ram them down!"

Yes, our war is just, therefore, we will be brave and invincible. However, the commander said:

	"What the comrades said is right, we must be brave. However, that's not entirely correct, we should also talk about tactics and improve technology, so that we can shoot down more enemy planes. You should become such pilots, as fierce as tigers and as alert as eagles."

The Party and superiors constantly help them improve their tactics and technology. Now, as soon as they fly into the sky, they divide the work to observe, discover enemy planes, and then enter air combat in an organized manner...

Thinking of this, Zhao Baotong's confidence and courage grew even more, and he said to the ground crew comrades:

	"Don't worry! Comrades, I will definitely answer the people of the motherland with shooting down enemy planes, and answer your tireless work spirit!"

At this moment, the command post's signal flares "bang! bang!" sounded, two brilliant green fireballs flew into the sky, this is the signal for battle, our planes are going to take off for combat!

In an instant, the engine roared, and pairs of "silver swallows" bravely slid onto the runway and took off neatly. After Zhao Baotong piloted the "silver swallow" into the air, he thought to himself: "No matter what, I must shoot down an enemy plane today." They vigilantly searched and advanced in the air. When the heroic squadron flew to the sky above ××, the ground command post notified our squadron commander by radio:

	"There are more than thirty enemy planes in front of you, fly up and eliminate the aerial bandits!"

	"Yes, fly up and eliminate them!"

At this time, Zhao Baotong had already seen a group of small black dots moving forward, vaguely, on the edge of a white cloud in the sea sky. All the flying warriors dropped their auxiliary fuel tanks, pushed the throttle and increased their speed to fly forward. When our aircraft flew to the front of the enemy aircraft, these cunning aerial robbers, a group of cross-shaped enemy aircraft, wanted to escape to the sea.

	"Launch the attack!" The team leader issued an order with an iron voice through the radio.

Zhao Baotong was the first to push his nose down and rush towards the enemy aircraft group; his comrade Fan Wanzhang closely guarded him from behind. The enemy aircraft group was disrupted by us. Enemy aircraft fled everywhere, and our aircraft chased everywhere. Suddenly flying up, suddenly flying down, one aircraft passed from the left for a while, and then another "swish" sound passed from the right for a while. Jet aircraft spat out strips of white smoke high in the sky, cutting through the blue sky of the early morning in a chaotic fashion, the air combat was very fierce.

Zhao Baotong rushed into the enemy aircraft group, wanting to hit the one on the left, wanting to hit the one on the right, flying up for a while to give the enemy aircraft above a few shots, and then diving down to give the ones below a few shots. He fought up and down, left and right, for a while, and then he thought that this would not work, I have to find a way to shoot one down to avenge the Korean people. He pulled the control stick and rose, he circled high in the sky like an eagle looking for the weakness of the enemy aircraft group. He had just flown up when he saw an enemy aircraft in his lower left corner about to turn and escape to the sea.

	"Where are you running!" He pushed his head down to chase. When he was only over a hundred meters away from the enemy aircraft, he opened fire on the enemy aircraft. Streaks of fire shot towards the enemy aircraft, he watched as the wings of this enemy aircraft shook and then dragged a long black plume of smoke, mixed with clusters of fireballs, and fell down.

All the enemy aircraft were either shot down or ran away.

Zhao Baotong and his comrades ascended into the sky with the joy of victory and returned. At this time, Zhao Baotong looked down and saw that on the coast, an enemy plane was tail up, its head stuck in the mud and burning; on the other side of the small mountain, an enemy plane was also burning with a raging fire; next to a white highway farther away, enemy planes were also burning after being shot down by us.

When they flew over a small city, they found two enemy planes bombing and strafing the city. "Dog robbers, can we let you go? You are here to strafe Korean women and children again, I must beat you down!" He asked the aerial commander for instructions, and after receiving permission, he took his comrade Fan Wanzhang and rushed towards the enemy planes! As soon as these two enemy planes saw Zhao Baotong, they turned their heads and ran away. Zhao Baotong chased them fiercely. In the blink of an eye, before one of the enemy planes could turn around, Zhao Baotong flew up and gave it a burst of fierce fire, and this enemy plane was finally shot down by him.

When they were fighting fiercely in the air, the ground crew and political staff were all gathered in the command vehicle listening to reports of the air battle. When they heard that this squadron had shot down many enemy planes today, everyone excitedly ran out to greet the returning air force heroes.

Pairs of lovely "silver swallows" landed steadily, all flying back victoriously. Zhao Baotong's plane was the last to land. When he taxied the plane to the refueling line, just turned off the engine, and before he could step out of the cockpit, his comrades surrounded him and asked:

	"Zhao Baotong, how many did you shoot down?"

He stretched out two fingers from the cockpit, and then said loudly:

	"Two! I made one of them kiss the mud, tail up and burning, and the other was shot down by me while it was strafing the Korean people."

Afterwards, Zhao Baotong was taken out of the cockpit by everyone, and everyone happily threw him into the sky...

In the subsequent air combat of less than thirty days, Zhao Baotong shot down and damaged a total of eight enemy aircraft. Because of his brave and resourceful combat, he made a battle contribution to the motherland, the Korean people, and peace-loving people all over the world. The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army awarded him a special merit once. He and his comrade Fan Wanzhang were awarded the "Military Service Medal" by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    击落击伤八架敌机的志愿军空军英雄赵宝桐
    刘大为
    在朝鲜一个野战机场的指挥室里，指挥员正伏案起草一个电报：
    “……我部在短短的空战时间当中，出现了很多英雄。其中飞行员赵宝桐同志，已经击落敌机六架，击伤二架，共击落击伤敌机八架……”
    指挥员一面写着一面想着：他不只是给上级写作战电报，他好像是在向朝鲜人民、祖国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民报告年青的中国人民志愿军空军，正在抗美援朝的战斗中迅速地成长。当他写到赵宝桐这个名字时，他想起这些年青的飞行员，在党和人民的抚育之下，逐渐变成能战胜风暴的雄鹰。“多么不容易啊，一个放猪出身的孩子，一个镟盘工人，迅速地掌握了高度的飞行技术，在战斗中成长起来了。”
    赵宝桐今年才二十五岁，东北抚顺人，共产党员。他很小的时候，由于祖父还不起地主的租子，他们家仅有的几亩地，也被地主霸占过去了。从此，他就和祖父一起给地主扛活。他给地主放过猪。后来，又到抚顺的一个工厂里去学镟盘工。一直到“八一五”苏联红军解放东北之后，他才得到解放。
    赵宝桐自从参加志愿军空军以后，他就和他的战友们在空中不断地打击敌人。他和他的战友们都同样热爱着自己的祖国，热爱朝鲜人民，对罪恶滔天的美帝国主义有无限的憎恨，一颗火热的心促使他们勇敢地实现自己的决心。这里，我们只叙述他第一次击落两架敌机的空战情况。
    那是一九五一年十一月四日的事情：
    天空闪耀着将要熄灭的晨星，机场上已经发出摩托响声。机械师们比太阳起的还早，他们已经把飞机准备好了。当赵宝桐和他的战友跳下汽车跑入座舱的时候，朝霞映红了银白色的“小燕”。机械师再一次地检查完了飞机，军械员们把炮弹装满了，他们围着座舱对赵宝桐说：
    “你看，今天天气这么好，一定能打上，祝你今天击落敌机！”
    “看见敌机多按几下大炮电钮，也替我们狠狠地打他几炮！”
    这些话深深地打动着赵宝桐的心坎。地勤人员迎着星光起床，带着月亮睡觉，日日夜夜地蹲在机翼底下，检查飞机，排除故障，保证飞行。后勤人员、政治工作人员、参谋人员、都日夜在忙碌，目的还不是为了一个，要击落敌机！更不要说全国人民的大力支援了。赵宝桐参加过好几次空战了，兄弟部队的空中勇士击落很多敌机，可是他们的这个机群还没有击落过敌机呢。是他们不勇敢吗？不，绝不是这样的，他们是非常勇敢的。
    有一次指挥员问他们：
    “同志们！敌人都是些老奸巨滑的飞行员，老强盗，你们有把握把他们打下来吗？”
    赵宝桐说：“别看这些敌人飞行的时间长，可是他们怕死，我撞也把他撞下来！”
    是的，我们的战争是正义的，因此，我们就会勇猛无敌。可是，指挥员说了：
    “同志们说的对，我们要勇敢。可是，这样说不完全，我们还应该讲战术，提高技术，这样才会更
    多地打下敌机来。你们应该成为这样的飞行员，像
    虎一样勇猛，像鹰一样机警。”
    党和上级不断地帮助他们提高战术、技术。如今，
    他们只要一飞上天空，就分工观察，发现敌机，然
    后有组织地进入空战……。
    赵宝桐想到这里，信心和勇气更大了，他对地勤
    同志们说：
    “放心吧！同志们，我一定以击落敌机来回答祖
    国人民，来回答你们日夜不倦的工作精神！”
    正在这时，指挥所的信号弹“砰！砰！”响了，两颗灿烂的绿色火球飞上天空，这是战斗的信号，我们的飞机要起飞作战去了！
    刹时，马达发出轰隆巨响，一对对的“银燕”勇敢地滑上跑道整整齐齐起飞了，赵宝桐驾驶着“银燕”腾空之后，他心里想道：“无论如何，今天非打下敌机来不可。”他们机警地在空中搜索前进。当英勇的机群飞到××上空的时候，地面指挥所用无线电通知我们机群的指挥员：
    “在你们前面有三十多架敌机，飞上去，消灭空中强盗！”
    “是，飞上去，消灭它！”
    这时赵宝桐已经看到在海面上空，一朵白云的边沿上，黑糊糊地向前移动着一群小黑点。所有的飞行勇士们，投掉了副油箱，一推油门加大速度向前飞去。等到我机飞临到敌机跟前时，这些狡猾的空中强盗，一群十字架形的敌机，想往海上逃窜。
    “投入攻击！”带队的指挥员用无线电斩钢截铁地下了命令。
    赵宝桐第一个一推机头向敌人机群冲去；他的战友范万章紧紧地在后面掩护着他。敌人机群被我们打乱了。敌机到处逃跑，我机到处追赶。忽然飞上，忽然飞下，一会儿从左边过去一架，一会儿又“刷”的一声从右边过去一架。喷气式飞机在高空喷出一条条白烟，七上八下的划破清晨的蓝色天空，空战打的十分炽烈。
    赵宝桐冲入敌人机群，看看左面的也想打，右面的也想打，一会飞上去给上面的敌机几炮，一会又扎下来给下面的几炮。他上下左右地打了一阵，这时，他想总这样不行呵，我得想法揍下一架来，为朝鲜人民报仇。他一拉操纵杆上升了，他像一只雄鹰一样，盘旋在高空寻找敌人机群的弱点。他刚刚飞上来就看见在他左下方有一架敌机正要转弯向海上逃跑。
    “那里跑！”他一推把头追下去了。当他离敌机只有一百多公尺的时候，他向敌机开火了。一条条的火练向敌机射去，他眼看着这架敌机翅膀抖了抖就拖着黑长的烟柱，夹杂着一团团的火球跌落下去了。
    所有的敌机都打落的打落，逃跑的逃跑了。
    赵宝桐和他的战友们带着胜利喜悦心情升入高空返航了。这时，赵宝桐向下看去，在海岸上，有一架敌机尾巴朝天，脑袋插在泥里正在燃烧；在小山那边也有一架敌机燃起熊熊大火；在更远的一条白色公路旁边，也有敌机被我们击落后在燃烧着。
    当他们从一个小城市的上空飞过时，发现两架敌机正在轰炸扫射这个城市。“狗强盗，这还能放过你们去吗？你们又来扫射朝鲜的妇女、儿童，我一定要把你揍下来！”他请示空中指挥员，得到允许之后，就带着他的战友范万章，向敌机冲去！这两架敌机一见赵宝桐吓得转头就跑，赵宝桐狠狠地追上去，说时迟那时快，一架敌机还没转过弯来呢，赵宝桐就飞上去，给了他一阵猛烈的炮火，这架敌机终于被他击落了。
    当他们在空中进行激烈战斗的时候，地勤人员，政治工作人员，都围在指挥车房听报告空战的情形，他们听到这队机群，今天击落了很多架敌机，大家都兴奋地跑出去迎接凯旋归来的空军英雄。
    可爱的“银燕”一对对地稳健地着陆了，全部胜利地飞回来了。赵宝桐的飞机是最后着陆的。当他把飞机滑到加油线上，刚刚关了车，还没跨出座舱的时候，同志们就围上来问了：
    “赵宝桐你打掉几架？”
    他从座舱里伸出两个手指头来，然后大声说道：
    “两架！我让他一架嘴啃泥，尾巴朝天的烧着了，另外一架正在扫射朝鲜人民的时候被我打掉了。”
    随后赵宝桐就被大家从座舱里抱出来，大家高兴地把他抛入天空……
    在以后不到三十天的空战当中，赵宝桐一共击落击伤八架敌机。由于他作战英勇机智，为祖国、为朝鲜人民，为全世界爱好和平的人民，立下了战功，中国人民志愿军司令部给他立特等功一次。他和他的战友范万章同志并荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的“军功章”。
