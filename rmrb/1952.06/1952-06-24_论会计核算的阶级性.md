Regarding the issue of the class nature of certain economic sciences, even now, some intellectuals in our country still lack a clear understanding. Therefore, they continue to spread arguments claiming that many economic sciences are devoid of class nature, and that the content of these sciences remains unchanged in any socio-economic formation.

This view also exists in our country's accounting field. Until now, one can still see the claim that accounting science has no class nature in publications. For example, Tao De, the author of the article "'Reflections on How to Establish the Theoretical Foundation of New China's Accounting'" published in the fourth issue of "New Accounting Monthly" in 1951, wrote:

"I... believe that accounting theory is essentially devoid of class nature; it is merely an applied technique combining writing and numbers." And Pan Xulun, who has many works on accounting, completely fails to see the difference between capitalist accounting and socialist accounting. This is particularly evident in some of his recent works. In his book "Advanced Commercial Bookkeeping Tutorial" (1951 edition), he applies the term "capital" to the socialist economy, uses the same method to classify the sources of operating funds for state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and treats the state as the same as capitalist entrepreneurs in terms of enterprise relations. He explained the sources of assets as follows: "Every enterprise should have its founder or basic investor. From a bookkeeping perspective, these people are called the owners of the enterprise. The owner of a state-owned enterprise is the state, the owner of a public enterprise may be a certain level of government or certain public organizations; the owner of a private enterprise may be one or several natural persons or private legal persons. The enterprise is the business founded and maintained by the owner, and should be provided with the assets necessary for business operations by the owner. These assets provided by the owner are called the owner's investment, also known as the enterprise's capital." (See Pan Xulun, "Advanced Commercial Bookkeeping Tutorial," 1951 edition, page 8.)

From these arguments and works, one can conclude that it seems that not only the methods and techniques of accounting, but even its content, purpose, and tasks, remain unchanged when one social system is replaced by another. This is a completely wrong and very harmful argument. This argument not only defends the principles and organization of capitalist accounting, but also promotes the preservation of these principles and organization under the conditions of the New Democratic system. In fact, only those who do not know the history of the development of this science, only those who do not understand the role of accounting in a class society, would deny the class nature of accounting.

In fact, accounting has been one of the tools of exploitation throughout its historical development. From the moment it arose, it has been used by the ruling class to supervise the amount of income earned and to find ways to increase that income. At this time, the task before accounting was not only to find out the amount of income earned by the enterprise owner, but also to present this income as not the result of exploitation, but as the reward for the "labor" contributed by the owner to his enterprise.

Initially, accounting was practiced in palaces, churches, and large landowners as far back as ancient times (two to three thousand years ago). Accounting was relied upon to observe the wealth of these economies, to observe their income and expenditure. For example, in our country, according to verifiable records, accounting already existed during the reigns of King Xuan, King You, and King Ping of the Zhou Dynasty (800-700 BC). At that time, accounting was mainly used to supervise the income of tributes and taxes levied from subjects. In medieval Europe, accounting developed greatly in the church. At that time, the church was one of the largest landowners. The power of the church, represented by the Pope of Rome, controlled a large part of the land and material wealth. In addition to its direct functions, the representatives of the church were also very actively engaged in lending and usury. In order to supervise all this wealth and business, it was necessary to establish very strict accounting. In the late Middle Ages (14th-15th centuries), the significant development of productive forces led to the growth of capitalist elements in the economy, which further developed and improved accounting. At this time, accounting began to be handled according to certain systems; these systems were described in some of the earliest works on accounting. It must be pointed out that these works not only did not conceal the class nature of accounting, but openly emphasized it. For example, one of the earliest authors of accounting books in Europe, the Italian monk Luca Pacioli (15th century), argued in his works that the important role of merchants in economic life should be recognized, and that the purpose of accounting was to help merchants obtain the greatest profits; he also introduced to merchants certain methods of protecting their commercial secrets.

Under the capitalist system, accounting developed in the direction of protecting the new ruling class – the bourgeoisie. Here, it fulfills the role of a clear class function, becoming the accounting of individual enterprises, becoming the accounting necessary for and serving the enterprise owner. The main task facing capitalist accounting is to show the profits obtained by the capitalist. With the help of accounting, capitalists can find new ways to increase profits by increasing the degree of exploitation of workers.

Capitalist enterprises, due to the anarchy of production, the fierce struggle for sales markets, and mutual competition between enterprises, try every means to protect their commercial secrets. Capitalists use commercial secrets as a tool to defend against competitors, and also to conceal the true sources of their profits from workers.

Lenin wrote about this:

“In large-scale economy, however, the business affairs are anyway known to hundreds if not more people. The law which protects commercial secrecy serves here not to satisfy the needs of production or exchange, but to conceal speculation and illegitimate methods of enrichment, and downright swindling, which, as we know, is particularly rife in joint-stock companies, where it is most skilfully concealed from the public by means of cooked accounts and balance-sheets.” (Lenin, Selected Works, Two-Volume Edition, Chinese Translation, Volume II, page 111.)

Under the capitalist system, accounting has been greatly developed, and various theories of accounting have begun to emerge. These theories do not conduct in-depth research on the content of accounting, but only attempt to find the basis for some of the main methods of accounting. Bourgeois theorists, because they regard capitalism as the eternal and best structure of human society, of course cannot truly scientifically establish the theory of accounting. But the discussions they made in some of the works on the theoretical basis of accounting are very useful to us, because these discussions can once again prove the class nature of accounting. For example, one of the earliest representatives of accounting theory in Europe declared that the economic owner is the center of economic life and economic undertakings, so all accounting records should be established in such a way as to show the significance of the owner to the economy. According to this theory, the income of the capitalist – the owner is not the result of exploiting workers, but only the "hard" reward for his "great labor" in organizing and leading the economy.

Some other representatives of this kind of accounting theory believe that accounting can not only provide materials to supervise economic activities, but also provide materials to solve the social problems of the current turbulent world. They do not put capitalists and workers in opposition, but put capitalists in opposition to each other, thereby concealing the true source of capitalist income - unpaid labor.

In his research on accounting theory, Pan Xulun is also developing this bourgeois view. Even in his recent books published under the conditions that our country has established the New Democratic system, he is still defending the idea that private ownership is eternal and unchanging, and concealing the class nature of accounting, trying to prove the legitimacy of capitalists seizing profits (see Pan Xulun's "Basic Accounting," 1950 edition, Chapters 2 and 3). He uses the formula "sales revenue minus cost equals profit" as the basis for his argument; at the same time, he also argues that profits are generated in the circulation process, concealing the fact that capitalists seize the surplus value created by workers in the production process, that is, concealing the capitalists' exploitation of workers (see Pan Xulun's "Basic Accounting," 1950 edition, Chapter 4).

Now, when our government is striving to develop the national economy as much as possible in order to better meet all the needs of the people, Pan Xulun actually made such a wrong argument, saying that "factories, shops and other enterprises, in principle, are aimed at making profits. The so-called profit is to hope to use less consumption or use of property as a means to obtain more property" (Pan Xulun, "Advanced Commercial Bookkeeping Tutorial," 1951 edition, page 4).

In his own various arguments, Pan Xulun directly repeats the arguments of American and European capitalist scholars. Most of the main "theories" developed in his works have already been included in the works of these scholars. For example, the famous German scholar Sombart in the 19th and early 20th centuries believed that the main use of accounting is to reflect the circulation of capital with various equations. He believes that "individual management (that is, private management) is the main form of people's economic activities," "double-entry bookkeeping is only accounting for private capital"; the profits obtained by capitalists "... in its essence, is nothing else, but an expense that is not recorded in the account, used as the remuneration of the entrepreneur, the interest of private capital, the surplus of speculation, the remuneration of various labor services recorded carefully, etc." Finally, according to Sombart's opinion, as well as Pan Xulun's opinion, it is believed that accounting is the same in any social economic form. Sombart wrote: "In the case of using accounting and balance sheet, no matter what kind of management method is used, the accounting structure in individual management is always the same...." The various arguments of the above-quoted bourgeois theorists indicate that they all avoid the essence of production relations in their accounting theories, and do not seek the true scientific basis of accounting. They believe that concealing the secrets of capitalist accumulation and theoretically defending and consolidating the rule of the bourgeoisie is their direct and main task. Lenin rightly pointed out this essence of bourgeois "theory." He wrote:

“Only socialism will liberate science from the bourgeois fetters, from its enslavement to capital, from its state of slavery to the self-interested interests of capitalism.” (“Lenin’s Complete Works”, Moscow Third Edition, Volume 23, page 41.)

×　　×　　×

Above, we have briefly studied the history of the development of accounting and the various "theoretical" claims developed by many bourgeois scholars in their works. All of these undeniably indicate that accounting is a science with class nature, a science that always only fulfills the purposes and tasks given to it by the ruling class of that society.

When the capitalist system is replaced by the socialist system or the New Democratic system, the purpose and tasks of accounting undergo fundamental changes. In the new system, accounting should not serve the interests of a few exploiters, but should serve the interests of the broad working people, should help to show the essence of the various processes that occur, rather than conceal them; should point out the way to improve the material life of the working people, rather than make it worse.

If, in the first few years of establishing the new system, the form and technology of accounting still retain the previous form and change relatively slowly, this does not mean that the entire accounting should be kept the same as the accounting in the previous capitalist society.

In the new system, the essence, purpose, and tasks of accounting have changed so drastically compared with the capitalist period, and this change will also cause changes in the form and technology of accounting in a short period of time. The experience of the Soviet Union has confirmed this. In the Soviet Union, accounting has gradually acquired the special forms and techniques that are unique to socialist accounting.

There is no doubt that the further work of the relevant leading departments of our government in establishing accounting is to formulate accounting forms and technologies that can fully undertake this task, according to the requirements of the New Democratic system and according to the tasks that accounting should bear in state-owned enterprises.

Progressive people in our country's accounting scholars should actively participate in this work. At present, they should not only help the government's leading departments in formulating new accounting, but also organize the work of criticizing the various viewpoints of the representatives of wrong accounting science. In addition, they should actively learn from the advanced experience of Soviet accounting, create new accounting theory works to reflect China's modern accounting practices, and point out the way to further improve this practice on the basis of adopting advanced Soviet experience.

    论会计核算的阶级性
    马洛
    关于某些经济科学的阶级性问题，直到现在，在我国某些知识分子中间还没有一个明确的概念。因而他们还在散布着这样的论调，说什么许多经济科学没有阶级性，这些科学的内容在任何社会经济形态中都是不变的。
    这种观点，在我国的会计核算方面也是存在的。直到现在，在出版物中还可看到关于会计科学没有阶级性的这种主张。例如，“新会计月刊”一九五一年第四期所登载的“‘怎样建立新中国会计理论基础’读后”这篇文章的作者陶德即曾写道：
    “我……认为会计理论在本质上是无所谓阶级性的，它只是文字和数量相结合的应用技术罢了。”而在会计方面有许多著作的潘序伦则完全没有看到资本主义会计和社会主义会计之间的区别。他最近的一些著作特别明显地表现了这一点。在他所著“高级商业簿记教程”（一九五一年版）一书中，就对社会主义经济应用了“资本”这个术语，对国营企业和对私营企业都用了相同的方法来进行经营资金来源的分类，在企业的关系上把国家看作同资本主义的企业主一样，他对于资产的来源曾作了如下的解释：“每一企业总该有它的创办人或基本投资人，这些人在簿记的立场称为该企业的业主。国营企业的业主就是国家，公营企业的业主可能是某级政府或某些公共团体；私营企业的业主可能是一个或几个自然人或私法人，企业就是业主所创办并予继续维持的营业，自应由业主给以营业上所必须应用的资产。这些由业主所供给的资产额称为业主的投资，也称为企业的资本。”（见潘序伦编著“高级商业簿记教程”，一九五一年版，第八页。）
    从这些论调和著作中可以得出结论，似乎不仅会计核算的方法和技术，连其内容以及目的和任务，在一个社会制度被另一个社会制度所代替的时候都是不变的。这是完全错误而又十分有害的论调。这种论调不仅是在替资本主义会计的原则和组织辩护，而且是要在新民主主义制度的条件下提倡保存这些原则和组织。其实，只有那些不知道这门科学的发展历史的人，只有那些不了解会计在阶级社会中所起的作用的人，才会否认会计核算的阶级性。
    事实上，会计在其以往历史发展的全部过程中曾是人剥削人的工具之一。它从发生的时刻起，就一直被统治阶级用来监督所得收入的数量和用来寻找可以增加这些收入的方法。这时，摆在会计面前的任务不仅是要查明企业占有者所得收入的数量，同时还要将这些收入表现为不是剥削的结果，而是由于占有者对自己企业所贡献的“劳动”而得到的报酬。
    起初，还在古代时候（二三千年以前），就在皇宫中以及在教堂中和大土地占有者那里实行了核算。依靠核算来观察这些经济所具有的财富，观察他们的收入和支出。例如，在我国，根据可考的记载来说，远在周宣王、幽王、平王时代（纪元前八百年——七百年）即已有核算。当时核算主要是用来监督贡物收入和从臣民征取的税款收入。在中世纪的欧洲，核算在教堂中得到了很大的发展。当时，教会是最大的地主之一。以罗马教皇为代表的教会权力支配着很大一部分土地和物质财富。此外，除本身的直接职能而外，教会的代表还非常积极地经营借款业务和高利贷。为了监督所有这些财富和业务，就要求非常严格地建立核算。在中世纪末叶（十四——十五世纪），由于生产力显著的发展，引起经济中资本主义成分的成长，使核算得到了进一步的发展和改善。这时，核算已开始按照一定的制度来处理；这些制度，在会计方面最早的一些著作中曾经叙述过。必须指出，在这些著作中不仅没有掩盖会计核算的阶级性，反而把它公开地强调出来。例如，欧洲最早的会计核算书籍的著作者之一——意大利的修道士陆基·巴其阿勒（十五世纪）在其著作中就主张承认商人在经济生活中的重要作用，并认为核算的目的就是要尽力帮助商人获得最大的利润；他还顺便给商人介绍了保护他们商业秘密的某些方法。
    在资本主义制度下，会计核算向保护新统治阶级——资产阶级的方向发展了。在这里，它实现着鲜明的阶级职务的作用，成为各个单独企业的核算，成为企业占有者所必需的并且为他服务的核算。摆在资本主义核算面前的主要任务，是要显示出资本家所得到的利润。借会计核算的帮助，资本家可以寻找新的方法，提高对工人剥削的程度，来增加利润。
    资本主义企业，由于处在生产的无政府状态、为销售市场而进行的残酷斗争及各企业之间互相竞争的情况下，所以要千方百计地来保护自己的商业秘密。资本家利用商业秘密作为防备竞争对手的工具，而且也是为了要对工人隐瞒自己所得利润的真实来源。
    列宁关于这一点写道：
    “在大经济中，其营业情形反正有几百以至更
    多的人知道。保持营业秘密的法律在这里并不是
    为了满足生产或交换上的需要，而是用来掩盖投
    机和极不正当的谋利方式，掩盖公然欺诈的行
    为。大家知道，在股份公司中，这种欺诈行为是特
    别流行，是用足以欺骗大众的伪造帐目和决算书
    办法来特别巧妙地掩盖着的。”（“列宁文选”两
    卷集，中译本第二卷第一一一页。）
    在资本主义制度下，会计已经得到很大的发展，于是开始出现形形色色的会计核算理论。这些理论并不是对于会计内容进行深刻的研究，而只是企图为会计上的一些主要方法寻找根据。资产阶级的理论家们，由于他们将资本主义看作永恒不变的最好的人类社会的结构，当然不可能真正科学地建立起会计核算的理论。但是他们在会计理论根据方面的一些著作中所做的论述对我们是很有用处，因为这些论述可以再一次地证明会计核算的阶级性。例如，欧洲最早的核算理论代表之一，曾宣称经济占有者是经济生活和经济事业的中心，因此一切核算记录都应该这样来建立，就是要能显示出占有者对于经济的意义。依照这个理论，资本家——占有者的收入并不是剥削工人的结果，而只是由于他在组织和领导经济方面的“巨大劳动”而得的“清苦”的报酬。
    这种核算理论的另一些代表认为：会计不仅可以提供材料来监督经济活动，而且还可以提供材料来解决现在动荡世界的那些社会问题。他们不将资本家和工人对立起来，而将资本家互相对立起来，从而掩盖资本主义收入的真实来源——无偿劳动。
    潘序伦在他对于会计核算理论的研究中，也在发展着这种资产阶级的观点。甚至于在我国已经建立新民主主义制度的条件下他所出版的几本最近的著作中，也还在替私有制永恒不变这种思想辩护，并隐蔽会计学的阶级性，力图证明资本家攫取利润的合法性（参看潘序伦著“基本会计学”，一九五○年版，第二章和第三章）。他以“销货收入减去成本等于利润”这个公式做为他这种论点的基础；同时，他还主张利润是在流通过程中产生的，隐蔽资本家攫取工人们在生产过程中所创造的剩余价值的事实，也就是掩盖资本家对于工人的剥削（参看潘序伦著“基本会计学”一九五○年版，第四章）。
    现在，当我国政府力图尽量发展国民经济，以便更好地满足人民的一切需要时，潘序伦竟然发出这样的错误论调，说什么“工厂商店等企业，在原则上都是以营利为目的。所谓营利，就是希望以较少财物的耗费或利用为手段，以获得较多的财物”（潘序伦编著，“高级商业簿记教程”，一九五一年版第四页）。
    潘序伦在他自己的各种主张中，直接了当地重复着美国和欧洲资本主义的学者们的论调。在他的作品中所发展起来的各种主要“理论”，大多数都早已包括于这些学者的著作中。例如，十九世纪和二十世纪初的德国著名学者塞尔认为：会计学的主要用途就是以各种方程式来反映资本的循环。他认为“单独经营（也就是私人经营）是人们经济活动底主要形式”，“复式簿记只是核算私人资本”；资本家们所得到的利润“……按其本质来讲，并不是什么别的东西，而是没有记入帐户的一项支出，用来做为企业主的酬劳，私人资本底利息，投机的盈余，经过细心记载的各种劳务的报酬等等”。最后，根据塞尔的意见，也正和潘序伦的意见一样，认为会计学在任何社会经济形态下都是一样的。塞尔曾写道：“在使用会计和平衡表的情况下，无论是怎样的经营方式，在个别经营中的会计结构总是一样的……。”以上所引证的资产阶级理论家们的各种主张，表示着他们在自己的会计理论中都躲避开生产关系的本质，并不寻求会计学的真正的科学基础。他们认为：隐蔽资本主义积累的秘密和在理论上来辩护和巩固资产阶级的统治，就是他们的直接的和主要的任务。列宁恰好指出来资产阶级“理论”的这种本质。他曾写道：
    “只有社会主义才把科学从资产阶级的桎梏中，
    从资本的奴役下，从它在森严的资本主义自私自
    利利益面前的奴隶地位解放出来。”（“列宁全
    集”，莫斯科第三版，第二十三卷，第四十一
    页。）
    ×　　×　　×
    以上我们简括地研究了会计的发展历史和许多资产阶级学者在其著作中所发展的各种“理论”上的主张，所有这些都无可置辩地表示着会计是一种有阶级性的科学，是永远只完成该社会统治阶级所赋予它的那种目的和任务的科学。
    当资本主义制度被社会主义制度或新民主主义制度所代替之后，会计的目的和任务就发生了根本的变化。在新的制度中，核算不应该服务于少数剥削者的利益，而应服务于广大的劳动人民的利益，应该帮助着显示出所发生的各种过程的本质，而不是掩盖它们；应该指出改善劳动人民物质生活的道路，而不是使其恶化。
    如果在建立新制度的最初几年内核算的形式和技术仍然保留着以前的形式并改变得比较缓慢时，这并不等于说要把整个的会计都保持着和以前资本主义社会中的会计一样。
    在新的制度中，核算的本质、目的和任务，和资本主义时期比较是有着那样急剧的改变，而这种改变也会使核算的形式和技术在短期间内发生变化。苏联的经验就证实了这一点。在苏联，会计已经逐渐取得了只为社会主义核算所特有的那种特殊的形式和技术。
    毫无疑问，我国政府的有关领导部门在建立会计核算这方面的进一步的工作，就是要根据新民主主义制度的要求，按照核算在国营企业中所应负的任务，而制订出能充分担负起这种任务的核算形式和技术。
    我国会计学者中的进步人士应该积极地参与这种工作。目前不仅应在制订新的会计方面帮助政府领导部门，而且应该组织对于错误的会计科学代表人的各种观点进行批判的工作，此外，积极学习苏联会计核算的先进经验，创作新的会计理论著作，来反映中国现代的会计实务，并在采用苏联先进经验的基础上指出进一步改善这种实务的道路。
