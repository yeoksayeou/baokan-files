    The Leadership of Jiaxing Silk Weaving Factory
    Should Value Workers' Inventions and Creations
    To the Editor: The leadership of our Jiaxing Silk Weaving Factory does not pay enough attention to workers' creations. The worker Du Xuecheng invented a method of using leather roller linings instead of boxwood on the spinning machine. This method has a great effect on production. But his creation has not received the support and promotion of the leadership and has been buried.
    I once proposed a rationalization suggestion for installing a certain type of electric stop motion device. The factory director accepted my suggestion and asked me to manufacture it. I encountered the following difficulties when manufacturing this machine in my spare time. First of all, there are many group meetings, and many things are left to us model workers, which leaves me with very little free time. Secondly, I did not receive technical help. When I designed the machine, I asked the comrades in the group for their opinions, but the technician in the group said that I did not understand invention and creation and did not support me. As a result, I had to draw the design and make it myself according to the drawing. Because no one helped me, I suffered countless failures and could not sleep at night. The leadership did not help solve these difficulties in time. Once, we organized a group of three to改造 (transform) the device for unloading 皮棍 (leather sticks). Some staff members opposed doing so and ordered the assembled device to be dismantled. The leadership knew about this, but did not say a word. I don't think this is right either.

### 嘉兴绢纺厂领导方面  应该重视工人的发明创造

    嘉兴绢纺厂领导方面
    应该重视工人的发明创造
    编辑同志：我们嘉兴绢纺厂领导方面对工人的创造不太重视。工人杜学成创造了在精纺机上用皮辊内衬代樛木的方法，这个方法在生产上有很大的作用。但他的创造没有得到领导方面的支持和推广，竟被埋没了。
    我曾提了一个装置某种电动停止机的合理化建议。厂长接受我的建议，要我制造。我在利用工余时间制造这个机器时，又有以下的困难。首先是小组会多，许多事让我们劳动模范做，使我空闲的时间很少。其次，我在技术上得不到帮助。我设计这个机器的时候，曾请小组同志发表意见，但小组中的技师说我不懂创造发明，不支持我，结果我只好自己绘图设计和按图制作。因为没有人帮助，我不知遭受了多少次失败，弄得夜里失眠。对我这些困难，领导方面都没有及时帮助解决。有一次，我们组织了三人小组，改造卸皮棍的装置。有些职员竟反对这样做，命令把已装置成的东西拆掉。领导方面知道了这件事，也一声不响。我认为这也是不应当的。
