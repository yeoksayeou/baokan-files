Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, 21st: The massive Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were fully completed on June 20th. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Headquarters has issued a public announcement, the full text of which is as follows:
The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, marking the great creation of the Chinese people, has been fully completed this month on the 20th. Among them, the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project was completed on June 14th, the Taipingkou Floodgate was completed on the 18th, and the final Huangshantou Control Gate and the flood diversion area dike were completed simultaneously on the 20th.
In accordance with the regulations of the Central People's Government’s Government Administration Council regarding the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, we completed the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project according to plan, and at the same time, we went all out to complete the south bank flood diversion area dike, control gate, and floodgate before the flood season. The floodgate is 1,054 meters long, making it the largest gate in our country. In completing all the above projects, we completed more than 7.8 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than 100,000 cubic meters of concrete, tens of thousands of cubic meters of stonework, and thousands of tons of steel reinforcement. At the same time, we also completed more than 100 million ton-kilometers of transportation of equipment, tools, grain, and fodder. Originally, the Central People's Government’s Government Administration Council and the Central South Military and Political Committee stipulated that the entire project would be completed in three months (90 days). Now, we have not only shortened the time, completing the task in 75 days, but also exceeded the engineering quotas in the construction process. Among them, the concrete project exceeded the original plan by 6%, and the earthwork exceeded the original plan by 3.6%. The reinforced Jingjiang Dike, even if it encounters a flood like that of 1949 again, the top of the dike will still be one meter above the water surface. Although it is not planned to divert floodwaters this year into the flood diversion area formed by the floodgate, control gate, and dike, if the Jingjiang flood is too large and the Jingjiang Dike is in danger, the floodwaters may be diverted to reduce the burden on the Jingjiang Dike.
The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is a large-scale, short-time, and difficult water conservancy construction project. Since the project started on April 5th, it has encountered eleven full rainy days and nine half-rainy days, which made the construction time even more urgent. The complex technical problems in the project caused us many difficulties from design to construction. However, thanks to the help of Soviet expert Comrade Bukov, and relying on the masses with a revolutionary spirit, and adopting a series of revolutionary methods, we were finally able to overcome the difficulties and achieve this great victory in a short time. The 300,000 employees participating in the project, composed of advanced workers, the People's Liberation Army, and emancipated peasants, formed a strong labor army. With their high political consciousness and patriotic labor enthusiasm, they accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, broke all conventions, and completed the engineering tasks, while meeting the requirements of good, fast, and economical. During the construction process, the efficiency of various tasks was very high. The efficiency of earthwork was doubled compared to the efficiency before liberation, and the efficiency of concrete was also higher than before liberation. The improvement of transportation efficiency played a great guarantee for the early completion of the project.
Now, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been fully completed, and only the follow-up work remains. Tens of thousands of labor heroes and labor models have emerged in this project, and we are preparing to hold a grand celebration meeting in the near future. A water release ceremony will be formally held at the control gate. Our 300,000 labor heroes have expressed that they must, on the basis of summarizing existing experience, meet the larger-scale peaceful construction tasks of the motherland and strive to achieve greater and more glorious victories in the construction of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, 21st: All employees participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. The abstract of the original letter is as follows:
Dear Chairman Mao:
The great Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, under your wise leadership, was successfully completed on the 20th of this month. We report to you the completion of this project with great excitement and joy. Hundreds of millions of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River are overjoyed. They are enthusiastically chanting your name and thanking you.
Since the day of the start of construction, the 300,000 People's Liberation Army and working people participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project have gone all out and resolutely struggled to realize your wise and great decision. There were many difficulties in the construction. For example, the project was large-scale, the construction time was tight, the transportation was inconvenient, and the technical conditions were insufficient and there were too many rainy days. However, we resolutely implemented your consistent teaching of adhering to relying on the broad masses and adopting a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to overcome difficulties, so we completed the task fifteen days ahead of schedule. For example, in the Huangtianhu silt removal project, our soldiers came up with many methods to overcome amazing difficulties. Huangtianhu was a large mud pit, with 70% of the silt inside being rotten plant fibers, and covered with thorny wild water chestnuts. They overcame difficulties to remove the silt from the lake and built a new four-kilometer-long flood barrier dike through the heart of the lake. Another example is Tan Yuncui, a seventeen-year-old female worker from Yidu County, who pushed a trolley on a light railway. In order to race against the flood, she pushed the trolley all night regardless of fatigue. Once, she fell on the track at night and her left hand was crushed by the trolley. However, she greeted the companions who came to help her, "Hurry up and move forward, the task is important." She said:
"My family is poor peasants. Chairman Mao led us to turn over and have a good life. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call, as long as the Jingjiang flood is controlled, I still have a right hand to work." People like this with great patriotism and selfless spirit, who represent the noble qualities of the working people of the new China, are not few among our workers, peasants, soldiers, technicians, administrative personnel, political workers, and logistics personnel. Tens of thousands of people have made contributions and become heroes and models this time. In addition, we also used the method of carrying out rationalization proposals to improve labor efficiency. Whether it is tying steel bars, pouring concrete, exploring stone, or transporting, the efficiency of each work has generally increased by one to several times this time. Especially in earthwork efficiency, it has increased by more than double compared to before liberation. Soldier Dai Guofa created a record of transporting sixteen cubic meters of soil per day within a transport distance of 119 meters this time. Engineers Li Fen and Wang Xiancheng improved the design of the bottom plate and gate of the control gate this time, saving a lot of steel for the country. The workers made the gates, and made the punching and riveting the best and the highest quality. In particular, the commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army, they are "both combat teams and production teams." For the sake of the motherland's construction cause, they have learned many technologies in a short period of time.
Many people say that the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is a great miracle. Indeed it is. Therefore, we are proud of it. But this glory should belong to you and to the broad masses of the people. Under your leadership, we will surely have more confidence and determination to do everything well, use the rich experience gained this time to meet the larger-scale construction tasks of the motherland, build our motherland as soon as possible, and make the new China move victoriously towards the road of socialism! We hereby report and look forward to your instructions.
Finally, we shout:
Long live Chairman Mao!

Tang Tianji, Li Xiannian, Wang Shusheng, Lin Yishan, Xu Ziwei, Tian Weiyang, Yuan Zhen, Huang Zhiyong, Lan Qiao, Bai Wenhua and all the personnel participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project are respectfully yours.
June 21, 1952

    荆江分洪工程全部完工  全体员工向毛主席报捷
    【新华社沙市二十一日电】长江中游巨大的荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程已于六月二十日全部完工。荆江分洪工程总指挥部顷发表公报，全文如下：
    标志着中国人民伟大创造的荆江分洪工程，业已在本月二十日全部竣工。其中，荆江大堤加固工程于六月十四日竣工，太平口进洪闸工程于十八日竣工，最后黄山头节制闸和分洪区围堤于二十日同时竣工。
    根据中央人民政府政务院关于荆江分洪工程的规定，我们按计划的完成了荆江大堤加固工程，并同时全力以赴，在汛前完成了南岸分洪区围堤和节制闸、进洪闸等工程，其中进洪闸长一千零五十四公尺，为我国第一大闸。在完成上述全部工程中，我们共作土方七百八十多万公方，混凝土十多万公方，砌石数万公方，扎钢筋数千吨。与此同时我们还完成了运输器材、工具、粮秣等一亿多吨公里。本来中央人民政府政务院和中南军政委员会规定以三个月（九十天）完成全部工程，现在我们不仅缩短了时间，七十五天就完成了任务，而且在施工中都超额完成了工程定量。其中如混凝土工程，比原订计划超过百分之六，土方比原计划超过了百分之三点六。加固后的荆江大堤，即使再遇一九四九年一样的洪水，堤顶还高出水面一公尺。进洪闸、节制闸和围堤构成的分洪区，虽然今年不拟分洪，但如遇荆江洪水过大，荆堤危险，即可能分洪以减轻荆堤的负担。
    荆江分洪工程是个规模大、时间短、困难多的水利建设工程，工程从四月五日开工后，先后遇到十一个全雨天、九个半雨天，这样就使施工的时间更加紧迫。工程中复杂的技术问题使我们从设计到施工遇到许多困难。但由于我们有苏联专家布可夫同志的帮助，又以革命的精神依靠了群众，采取了一系列的革命办法，所以终于能克服困难，在短时间内取得了这一巨大的胜利。参加工程的三十万员工，他们是由先进的工人、人民解放军和翻身农民所组成的一支坚强的劳动大军，凭着他们高度的政治觉悟和爱国主义劳动热情，接受了苏联的先进经验，打破了一切陈规，完成了工程任务，而且符合好、快和节省的要求。施工中，各种工作效率都很高，土工效率较解放前的工效提高了一倍，混凝土也比解放前为高。而运输效率的提高，更对工程提前完成起了很大的保证作用。
    现在，荆江分洪工程已经全部竣工了，剩下的只是善后工作。这次工程中涌现出数以万计的劳动英雄和劳动模范，我们正在准备不日举行一个盛大的庆功会。节制闸并将正式举行放水典礼。我们三十万劳动健儿，都纷纷表示，一定要在总结现有经验的基础上，来迎接祖国更大规模的和平建设任务，争取在祖国的建设事业上，取得更大更加光荣的胜利。
    【新华社沙市二十一日电】参加荆江分洪工程的全体员工写信向毛主席报告荆江分洪工程胜利完工。原信摘要如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    伟大的荆江分洪工程在您的英明领导下，已经在本月二十日胜利完工了。我们以极大的兴奋和愉快的心情，向您报告这个工程的完成。荆江两岸千百万人民都欢欣若狂。他们正在热烈欢呼着您的名字，感谢您。
    自从开工的那一天起，我们参加荆江分洪工程的三十万人民解放军和劳动人民，便全力以赴，为实现您的英明伟大的决策而坚决奋斗。施工中有很多困难。例如，工程规模浩大，施工时间紧迫，交通不便，以及技术条件不够和雨日过多等。但是，我们坚决执行了您历来教导的坚持依靠广大群众，采取革命的精神和革命的办法来克服困难，所以提前十五天完成了任务。譬如，在黄天湖排淤工程中，我们的战士便想出了许多办法，克服了令人惊奇的困难。黄天湖是一个大泥潭，里面的淤泥十分之七是腐烂植物的纤维，并且有满湖刺人的野菱角。他们克服困难排除了湖里的淤泥，穿过湖心修成了一条长达四公里的拦洪新堤。又如宜都县十七岁的女工谭云翠，她在轻便铁道上推斗车。为了和洪水抢时间，她连夜不顾疲乏地推车。有一次夜间推车她摔倒在轨道上，被斗车压断了左手。但是，她却招呼来扶她的同伴“赶快前进，任务要紧”。她说：
    “我家是贫农，毛主席领导我们翻了身，有了好日子。为了响应毛主席的号召，只要把荆江洪水治好，我还有一只右手可以工作。”像这样具有伟大的爱国主义和忘我精神的人，代表新中国劳动人民的高贵品质的人，在我们的工人、农民、战士、技术人员、行政人员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员中间是不少的。上万的人这次立了功，当了英雄和模范。此外，我们还用开展合理化建议的办法，提高了劳动的效率。扎钢筋、浇灌混凝土、探石、运输等无论那一项工作的效率，这次都普遍提高了一倍到几倍。尤其在土工效率，比解放前提高了一倍以上。战士戴国法这次创造了在一百一十九公尺运距内，每日能运土十六公方的纪录。工程师李芬和王咸成这次改进节制闸闸底板和闸门的设计，为国家节省了大量钢料。工人们制闸门，把冲眼和铆钉都做得最好，质量最高。特别是我们的人民解放军的指战员们，他们是“战斗队又是生产队”。为着祖国建设事业，他们在短短的时间内学会了好些技术。
    许多人说：荆江分洪工程的胜利完成是一个伟大的奇迹。的确是这样。因此，我们引为无上的光荣。但这个光荣是应当属于您的，属于广大人民的。我们在您的领导下一定会更有信心和决心把一切事情做好，以这次获得的丰富经验来迎接祖国更大规模的建设任务，把我们的祖国早日建设好，使新中国朝着社会主义的道路胜利迈进！谨此报告，并盼望您的指示。
    最后我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！唐天际、李先念、王树声、林一山、许子威、田维扬、袁振、黄志勇、蓝侨、白文华暨参加荆江分洪工程的全体人员谨上。
    一九五二年六月二十一日
