    People's Opinions on Film Screenings
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    Farmers Demand More Films to Go to the Countryside

    Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers in small and medium-sized cities, reflecting the enthusiastic welcome from the masses when film teams go to the countryside to show movies to farmers. They hope that more films will be shown in the countryside for the farmers. Yang Jilong from Gaochun County, Southern Jiangsu, wrote that he saw movies with farmers in Gaochun County, Southern Jiangsu, last year, and the farmers were extremely happy. He said that Gaochun County showed movies once in the second half of last year, and the farmers really liked watching them. They are always hoping to see movies again sometime, but it never happens. They said that if there is a film team in Southern Jiangsu, please be sure to go to Gaochun County to show movies to the farmers, especially movies about collective farms.

    Guan Xiangming from Weifang, Shandong, wrote that recently the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education went to the Ninth District of Weixian County, Shandong Province, to show the film "Sons and Daughters of China," and in one evening, more than 10,000 viewers gathered. This shows how much the farmers love movies. He believes that films with educational significance and depicting the lives of farmers should be shown more in rural areas, especially films like "Happy Life" and "Beautiful Rivers and Mountains," which have a great impact on the production and ideological education of farmers and will make farmers love the motherland more and have more confidence in their future. The farmers were very excited to see the happy lives of Soviet farmers and the advanced methods of using machines for farming and harvesting in "Happy Life".

    Long Minzhen of the Jiaodong Fruit Tree Horticulture Command in Yantai wrote: Several workers in a certain orchard who had just come from the countryside to work, after watching the movie "Happy Life," said excitedly, "The life of Soviet farmers is so happy, let's work hard, and in the future, when Chinese farmers implement the collective farm system, they can also live a happy life like them!" This film is very enlightening to the masses of farmers. He said that currently, movies are shown more in big cities, but not enough in small counties and rural areas. He hopes that film projection teams will often go to the countryside to show movies depicting the lives of Soviet collective farmers to educate farmers.

    Li Tianjiu from the Pingyuan Daily wrote that because of various limitations, movies cannot be shown extensively in rural areas yet, so he hopes to print a large number of movie picture books. If a village buys one, the whole village can take turns to see it, which can make up for the shortage of movies. Cong Sen and other readers from Shandong Normal College in Jinan suggested that Chinese filmmakers create and shoot more films with significant educational value and take them to the countryside to show them.

    He Yatian of a certain PLA factory and a group from a certain PLA unit suggested that Soviet films such as "The Village Teacher" and "Dan Niang" be shown in rural areas. The former will have a profound educational significance for elementary school teachers teaching in rural areas; the latter will educate young people to bravely fight against the enemy for the motherland and for peace.

    More Publicity Work Should Be Done Before and After Film Screenings

    After the "Helping Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Watch Movies" brief commentary was published in this newspaper on June 15, we have continuously received letters from readers suggesting that movie theaters should print more film brochures or have specialists explain the content of the film before the screening to help workers, peasants, and soldiers watch movies. We now publish a summary of readers' opinions below:

    Deng Tinghuan of the Supreme People's Court suggested that movie theaters universally print film brochures. He said: "Some films have too fast a change of shots, some people's names in translated films cannot be remembered, and some are not clear; some films have complex content, and the audience cannot fully understand and accept the content of the film. In short, without a brochure as a guide, it will hinder the audience from accepting the content of the film." Yuan Heng of Renmin University and Feng Fan of the State Taxation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Finance also have the same opinion. Feng Fan said that the lives, customs, etc. of foreign people depicted in translated films, the artistic expression methods of these films, and the speed of the moving shots are relatively unfamiliar to Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, there are many difficulties in understanding the content of the film. If translated films are taken to the countryside to be shown, the detailed introduction work before the screening is even more important.

    After the Soviet film "Guilty Without Guilt" was shown in various places, Dong Ke from Beijing and Da Yinglu from the Affiliated Middle School of Nanjing University wrote to reflect that many viewers did not understand the story of the film. Dong Ke said that the work of translating films into Chinese dialogue has achieved great results, but this cannot completely solve the problem of the audience not understanding all the content of the film. How to help the audience understand the film and deeply understand its educational significance is very important. He hopes that film publicity agencies can print more brochures to solve this problem. Da Yinglu said: "Without a certain level of ideological and historical knowledge, it is impossible to understand the full content of 'Guilty Without Guilt.'" He said that the People's Daily published a review article on the film, helping some viewers to recognize the positive significance of this film; but not everyone who watches the film can see the newspaper's review article, so he believes that it is very important to briefly and succinctly explain the content of the film to the audience before the film is shown.

    Wang Zhenchao of the Xishan Hot Spring Middle School in Beijing wrote to raise objections to the fact that the songs in translated films only have Chinese subtitles and the songs are not translated. He said: The songs in the Soviet film "Happy Life" were not translated into Chinese (The interlude in the film "Happy Life" already has a Chinese translation in the 30th issue of "Popular Cinema". Currently, it is technically difficult to require that the songs in translated films be translated into Chinese and sung in the film. But the demands of the masses are worth noting. - Editor), only Chinese subtitles. When this film was shown in the countryside, many farmers could not understand the songs and could not understand the subtitles. Even literate people could not see the characters' actions because the shots moved so quickly that they were busy reading the words. Many farmers could not understand or hear what was going on.

    Li Qingshan of the Suzhou District Taxation Bureau in Southern Jiangsu wrote that the Soviet film "The Man with the Gun" had a brief Chinese explanation, which could help some urban audiences understand the content of the film. He thinks this is a good thing to do.

    Tong Beipei of Landianchang in the Western Suburbs of Beijing wrote to agree with some of the methods proposed in the brief commentary "Helping Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Watch Movies" in this newspaper. He said that when the Soviet films "Spring in the Mountains" and "Lenin in 1918" were shown in Landianchang in the Western Suburbs of Beijing, many viewers did not fully understand what was being depicted in the film after watching it. He believes that publicity and explanation work is very important.

### 群众对放映电影的意见——读者来信综述情况  农民要求更多的电影下乡

专栏：读者来信

    群众对放映电影的意见
    ——读者来信综述情况
    农民要求更多的电影下乡
    近来本报收到许多中小城市读者的来信，这些来信反映了电影队下乡给农民放映电影，受到群众热烈欢迎的情形。他们希望有更多的电影下乡，给农民放映。苏南高淳县杨继龙来信说，他去年在苏南高淳县和农民一起看到了电影，农民高兴极了。他说，高淳县在去年下半年就放过一次电影，农民实在喜欢看。他们总盼望着啥时候再看看电影，但总盼不来。他们说，苏南如果有电影队，请一定到高淳县给农民放映一下，尤其盼望看到关于集体农庄的电影。
    山东潍坊官象明的来信说，最近山东省文教厅曾到山东潍县第九区放映电影“新儿女英雄传”，一个晚上，便集合了观众一万多人。这说明了农民多么喜爱电影。他认为富有教育意义的、表现农民生活的影片应多到农村去放映，特别像“幸福的生活”“锦绣河山”一类影片，对农民的生产和思想教育都有很大作用，会使农民们更热爱祖国，对自己的未来更有信心。农民们看到“幸福的生活”中苏联农民的幸福生活和用机器耕作和收割的先进方法，都十分兴奋。
    烟台胶东果树园艺指挥所龙敏珍的来信说：某一果园里有几个新从农村出来参加工作的工人，看了电影“幸福的生活”以后，兴奋地说：“苏联农民的生活多么幸福，我们好好干吧，将来中国农民实行集体农庄制后，也能过他们一样的幸福生活！”这部影片对农民群众的启发是很大的。他说，目前，电影在大城市中放映得多，而到小县城和农村放映得还很不够，希望电影放映队经常到农村放映描写苏联集体农民生活的影片，以教育农民。
    平原日报李天久来信说，现在因各种条件的限制，电影还不能大量地到农村中去放映，所以希望大量地印制电影小人书。一个村子买了，全村的人可以轮流看到，这可以补救电影数量的不足。济南山东师范学院丛森及其他读者来信建议中国的电影工作者多创作、拍摄具有重大教育意义的影片，拿到农村中去放映。
    解放军某工厂何亚田、解放军某部一行等来信建议，把苏联影片“乡村女教师”“丹孃”等拿到农村放映。前者将对在农村教书的小学教师们有深刻的教育意义；后者将教育青年们为祖国、为和平而勇敢地同敌人斗争。
    电影放映前后应多作宣传工作
    六月十五日本报发表了“帮助工农兵看电影”的简评以后，连续收到一些读者来信，这些来信建议各电影院多印发电影说明书，或在电影放映前由专人讲解影片的内容，以帮助工农兵观众看电影。现在把读者的意见摘要发表于后：
    最高人民法院邓庭焕建议各电影院普遍印发电影说明书。他说：“有些影片的镜头变换太快，有些翻译影片中的人物名称记不住，有的话也听不清；有些影片内容复杂，而观众对于影片的内容不能充分理解和接受。总之，没有说明书做向导，会妨碍观众接受影片内容。”人民大学袁蘅、中央财政部税务总局冯凡等也都有同样的意见。冯凡说，翻译电影中所描写的外国人民的生活、风俗等，这些电影艺术的表现手法、镜头移动的速度，对于中国的工农兵观众是比较生疏的。所以在理解影片的内容上有不少困难。如果把翻译影片拿到乡村放映，放映前的详细介绍工作就更重要。
    苏联电影“无罪的人”在各地放映以后，北京董克、南京大学附中达英禄等来信反映：有不少观众看不懂这个影片的故事。董克说，翻译影片在译成华语对白的工作上是有很大成绩的，但这并不能完全解决观众看不懂影片内容的全部问题。如何帮助观众看懂影片和深刻了解它的教育意义，这个工作是很重要的。他希望电影宣传机构能多印发说明书来解决这个问题。达英禄说：“如果没有一定的思想水平和历史知识，是不能理解‘无罪的人’的全部内容的。”他说人民日报登载了该影片的评介文章，帮助某些观众认识了这部影片的积极意义；但报纸的评介文章不是所有看电影的人都能看到的，所以他认为在电影放映以前，向观众简单扼要地说明影片的内容是很重要的。
    北京西山温泉中学王振朝来信对翻译影片中的歌曲只有中文字幕，没有把歌子翻译出来，提出意见。他说：苏联影片“幸福的生活”中的歌曲没有译成中文（影片“幸福的生活”中的插曲，在“大众电影”第三十期上已有中文译文。目前要求翻译影片中的歌曲都能译成中文，并在片中演唱，在技术上还有困难。但群众的要求是值得注意的。——编者），只有中文字幕，这部影片在农村放映时，有不少农民听不懂歌，也看不懂字幕。识字的人也因镜头移动得快，顾得看字，顾不得看人物的动作。有不少农民看不懂，也听不懂是怎么回事。
    苏南苏州专区税务局李青山的来信说，苏联影片
    “带枪的人”有简短的中文说明，可以帮助城市一部分观众领会影片的内容，他认为这样做很好。
    北京西郊蓝靛厂佟北培来信，赞成本报“帮助工农兵看电影”简评中提出的一些办法。他说在北京西郊蓝靛厂放映苏联电影“山野的春天”“列宁在一九一八”时，不少观众看完后不完全明白电影中所描写的是怎么回事。他认为宣传解释工作很重要。
