Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th: The American aggressors are transporting Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war from Koje Island to Jeju Island, plotting to detain all Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants.

After the American aggressors carried out bloody massacres of captured personnel from Korea and China, they claimed that they would continue to "screen" the prisoners of war and announced that 30,000 prisoners of war would be moved from Koje Island. Based on the U.S. side's past actions, the so-called "relocation" is a synonym for "forced detention." According to the U.S. announcement, among the prisoners of war about to be moved from Koje Island, there are 5,500 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. An Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 17th stated that the U.S. side had "moved these 5,500 Chinese prisoners of war by wagon to a rebuilt camp near the dock area." "They will soon be transported to Jeju Island. This is an island overseas from South Korea, where 15,000 Chinese prisoners of war who expressed their unwillingness to return to Communist rule were sent two months ago."

The American aggressors have thoroughly exposed their conspiracy to detain Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war here. In April, when the U.S. side dispersed a large number of our captured personnel on Koje Island, U.S. spokesman Hickman once declared: "Those who say they do not want to be sent back" are being sent to "prison camps on the mainland." But the facts now prove that the U.S. side secretly sent 15,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to Jeju Island, which is outside the mainland. And now they are going to smuggle another 5,500 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war there. The despicable intention of the U.S. side is very obvious, that is, to detain all the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war silently, and in the future send them directly from Jeju Island to Taiwan, so as to arbitrarily persecute them or force them to serve as cannon fodder for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants, the mortal enemies of the Chinese people.

People's Volunteer Army personnel here pointed out: The U.S. side is not only stubbornly refusing to accept our reasonable compromise plan in Panmunjom, but is also intensifying its activities of detaining large numbers of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, especially attempting to detain all our Volunteer Army prisoners of war, which we absolutely cannot allow. This conspiracy of the U.S. side fully demonstrates the extreme hostility of the American aggressors towards the Chinese people. This can also be seen from the absurd plan of the U.S. side on April 28. In that plan, the U.S. side detained a particularly large proportion of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. This conspiracy of the U.S. side exposes that the U.S. side not only has no intention of reaching a truce agreement at all, but also attempts to break up the negotiations. The American aggressors must bear the responsibility for all the serious consequences of this.

### 美方阴谋扣留我志愿军全部战俘

    美方阴谋扣留我志愿军全部战俘
    【新华社开城十八日电】美国侵略者正在把巨济岛上的中国人民志愿军被俘人员运往济州岛，阴谋扣留全部中国人民志愿军被俘人员，把他们送给蒋介石残余匪帮。
    美国侵略者在对朝中被俘人员进行了血腥屠杀以后，就声称将继续对战俘进行“甄别”，并宣布要将三万战俘迁离巨济岛。根据美方过去的行动判断，所谓“迁离”，就是“强迫扣留”的代名词。据美方宣布，在这批即将被迁离巨济岛的战俘中，有五千五百名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。美联社巨济岛十七日电称，美方已将“这五千五百名中国战俘用大篷车迁到码头区附近一个重建的营场”。“他们不久将被运往济州岛。这是南朝鲜海外的一个岛屿，两个月前，有一万五千名表示不愿回到共产党统治下的中国战俘被送到了那个岛上。”
    美国侵略者在这里彻底暴露了它的扣留中国人民志愿军战俘的阴谋。在四月间美方将巨济岛上我方被俘人员大量分散的时候，美方发言人希克曼曾经宣称：“那些说他们不愿被送回的人们”是被送到“大陆上的俘虏营”去的。而现在事实证明，美方偷偷地将一万五千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员送到在大陆以外的济州岛上去了。而现在又要将五千五百名中国人民志愿军被俘人员偷运到那里去。美方的卑鄙用心是很明显的，这就是想把中国人民志愿军被俘人员不声不响地全部扣留下来，并在将来把他们直接从济州岛送往台湾。以便任意残害或强迫他们充当中国人民的死敌蒋介石残余匪帮的炮灰。
    此间中国人民志愿军人士指出：美方不但在板门店顽固地拒绝接受我方的合理折衷方案，反而在加强其大批扣留朝中被俘人员的活动，特别是企图扣留我志愿军全部被俘人员，这是我们绝对不能容许的。美方这个阴谋，充分说明了美国侵略者对中国人民极端的敌视。这点从美方四月二十八日的荒谬方案中也可以看出。在那个方案中，美方扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的比例特别大。美方这个阴谋，暴露出美方不仅根本无意于达成停战协议，而且企图破裂谈判。对于这点，美国侵略者必须负担其一切严重后果的责任。
