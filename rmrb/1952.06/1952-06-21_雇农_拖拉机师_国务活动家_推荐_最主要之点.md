Hired Peasant - Tractor Driver - Statesman
——A Recommendation of "The Most Important Thing"
Chen Weiren
    "The Most Important Thing" is written by Basha Angelina, the Soviet socialist labor hero, Stalin Prize winner, and representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. It was published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House in 1951. In this booklet, the author vividly writes about her major experiences over the past thirty years. As the author said, she herself emerged and became a hero along with the people of the whole country. Therefore, it can also be said to be the common experience of 200 million ordinary people in the Soviet Union.

    The author wrote this book in 1947, after the victory of the Great Patriotic War. At that time, she had just gone through the difficult years of the war, but the United States was frantically carrying out the "Cold War," and the shadow of war was threatening the people of the world again. In such circumstances, Angelina, as an ordinary Soviet person, told her friends at home and abroad, especially those foreigners who did not understand or did not fully understand the Soviet Union, what she wanted to say, and wrote down her great thirty years of creating a new life and fighting for peace rather than war along with the people of the whole country.

    Angelina's experience is ordinary. She and her parents were once hired peasants. After the October Revolution, her family became mortal enemies of the rich peasants and saboteurs. The enemy took potshots at her, and a cart ran over her, causing her to faint covered in blood. When the Party and Stalin decided to implement the great socialist transformation in the countryside, she became a female tractor driver in 1930. Because of her special contribution to this glorious combat post, the people elected her as a representative to the Supreme Soviet. Her resume is like this: hired peasant - tractor driver - statesman.

    Being a tractor driver can be said to be the most important point in her entire experience. In the early days of the Patriotic War, the German invaders occupied her hometown, the village of Starobeshevo in the Stalin region. She and the tractor team she led retreated driving tractors. She said: "'Tractor,' as a concept, means not only 'a traction machine with an internal combustion engine' for me personally and for the entire Soviet people, but also has a much greater meaning. The tractor helped the countryside to renovate the entire life, it eliminated the boundaries that divided the land into countless pieces, and it dragged millions of farmers into the collective farm life..." She felt proud that she had been a female tractor driver for a long time. She said: "This is not 'just my job'. This is my position in the struggle to complete our country's five-year plans, my combat post during the days of the Patriotic War, and a source of happiness, abundance, and glory."

    Indeed, Angelina participated in the struggle of the Soviet Union's five-year plans. When she became a tractor driver in the spring of 1930, it was the time when the Soviet Union was carrying out the first five-year plan intensely, and "new construction projects appeared everywhere on the vast Soviet land." Throughout the Soviet Union, the collective farm movement had entered the stage of overall collectivization since the summer of 1929, and there were about 60,000 tractor drivers in the Soviet Union in 1930. In order to thoroughly liberate the peasants from poverty, the Bolshevik Party unswervingly pushed this movement forward. How broad and smooth is Angelina's path! But things were not that simple. She said: "It is certainly easy to say now, 'If you want to do it, do it well.' But in those days, in the spring of 1930, it was so difficult and so much suffering!" The reason is that she was the only woman among these approximately 60,000 tractor drivers, and she was the first female tractor driver in the Soviet Union. People were not used to seeing a woman do such a thing. "Old religious women, according to the whispers in the ears of the priests, spat when they saw 'shameless Basha' wearing work clothes and driving a tractor." Once she was transporting grain and encountered a thunderstorm on the road. She was thrown off the ox cart, and rumors spread throughout the village, saying that "Heaven is punishing Basha." Not only that, but even some of her colleagues, male tractor drivers, ridiculed her: "Women can't do anything!" Even when the facts proved that Basha's work performance exceeded other colleagues, they said they wanted to "promote" her to the gasoline depot to do the work of distributing gasoline. In short, "women can't drive tractors."

    Even so, Angelina did not lose heart, because she knew for sure: "When initiating any legitimate cause, one can expect the support of the Party." The fact is exactly like this, the Party fully supported and encouraged her. Ivan Kurov, the director of the political department of the agricultural machinery station and a Bolshevik Party member, paid special attention to her new plan to establish a "female tractor team." On February 19, 1933, Comrade Stalin also clearly pointed out in his speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers: "Women are a great force in collective farms. It is a crime to bury this force. Our responsibility is to promote women in collective farms and use this force." (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism" page 558)

    It is precisely because of the Bolshevik Party and Stalin that, as Angelina said, although at that time "our collective farmers have not yet enjoyed the fruits of the new life, they have firmly believed in this new life." Angelina and her female tractor team created miracles time and time again. Their cause and achievements have finally "developed into a universal phenomenon that can affect the fate of the country." By 1939, Angelina and her partners issued a call to women all over the Soviet Union:
    "100,000 female comrades go to drive tractors," and 200,000 people rose up to respond. What a magnificent team! This movement made a huge contribution to the Soviet Great Patriotic War.

    Angelina's struggle process has opened up a broad road for Soviet women to create a better life. This is also an extremely beneficial inspiration for the Chinese people today.

    Many people who grew up in capitalist countries cannot imagine why there would be a resume of "hired peasant - tractor driver - statesman" in the Soviet Union. The editors of the American "Who's Who in the World" listed Angelina as a "celebrity," and absurdly thought that her "rapid advancement" was no different from that of members of the House of Lords. Therefore, what they asked Angelina was certainly not what she needed to say. What she needed to say most was what the American farmer Martin expressed his greatest concern in his letter: What exactly is it due to that an illiterate hired peasant in the Soviet Union can become a statesman? In the booklet "The Most Important Thing," the author gave a thorough answer to this question.

    In capitalist countries, labor is considered a shameful thing, and of course such a thing has become an incredible anecdote; while in the Soviet Union, labor is considered the most glorious thing by people. Angelina is working with a noble sentiment of loyalty to the motherland, loyalty to the people, loyalty to the Party, and loyalty to Stalin. Under the quota stipulated by law of cultivating 300 hectares of land per tractor with 15 horsepower, she guaranteed to Comrade Stalin that she would reach a workload of 1,200 hectares. By 1939, her tractor team had achieved a high quota of cultivating 2,000 hectares of land per tractor. During the Great Patriotic War, although the German invaders destroyed the peaceful life of the Soviet people, Angelina still stubbornly attacked the "highest limit" on the agricultural production front, "as if the fate of the war depended on it."

    Angelina has met Comrade Stalin many times and won the Order of Lenin twice. She once participated in the extraordinary Eighth Soviet Congress as a representative to approve the Stalin Constitution. In Stalinon, there is also a "Basha Angelina" street. Her honors are endless.

    She said: "In our country, becoming a glorious person means obtaining a high evaluation of one's labor from the people." Obviously, such glory cannot be achieved by a "beautiful flight," but by "tenacious, selfless labor."

    What the Soviet people need is labor, is peace, and definitely not war. They are very disgusted with war.

    Angelina's daughter was born in the sound of air raids. Therefore, Angelina, as the mother of thousands of children in the Soviet Union, told the instigators of war: "No! We never want war, and we never intend to bomb New York and suffocate the children of the American farmer Martin." She also said: "Because we have Stalin, we have absolute certainty to look forward to our future. We will certainly build our happy future; if necessary, we will certainly defend our future."

    The above is the most important point in Angelina's life that she said in "The Most Important Thing." In the Soviet Union, there can be such people's experiences; in China, in the era of Mao Zedong, there have also begun to be batches of female tractor drivers, female train drivers, female aviators, female engineers, and female dispatchers.... The women of New China have appeared one after another in positions that were previously unimaginable. This is a huge force for developing production and defending peace. Everyone will regard improving labor efficiency and striving for peace as the most important point in our lives today in their own positions.

    雇农—拖拉机师—国务活动家
    ——推荐“最主要之点”
    陈维仁
    苏联安格林娜著莫斯科外国文书籍出版局一九五一年出版
    “最主要之点”一书，是苏联社会主义劳动英雄、斯大林奖金获得者、苏联最高苏维埃代表芭莎·安格林娜写的。在这本小册子里作者生动地写着自己三十年来的主要经历。正如作者所说，她自己是和全国人民一块出头，一块成为英雄的，所以，它同时又可说是苏联两万万普通人民的共同经历。
    作者写这本书时，是在伟大卫国战争胜利以后的一九四七年。那时她刚度过苦难的战争岁月，可是美国却又在狂热地进行着“冷战”，战争的阴影重新威胁着世界人民。安格林娜就在这样的情况下，以一个普通苏联人的身份，向国内外的朋友们，特别是对不了解或不完全了解苏联的那些外国人，说出了自己所要说的话，写下了自己跟全国人民一道为创造新的生活，为和平而不是为战争的伟大的三十年。
    安格林娜的经历是平凡的。她和她的父母都曾经是雇农。十月革命以后，她的一家都成了富农暗害分子的死对头。敌人向她放过冷枪，马车从她的身上碾过，以致曾使她满身血淋淋地昏过去。当党和斯大林决定在农村中实行伟大的社会主义变革时，从一九三○年起，她就当了女拖拉机师。由于她在这个光荣的战斗岗位上有了特殊的贡献，人民推举她为最高苏维埃代表。她的履历就是这样：雇农——拖拉机师——国务活动家。
    当拖拉机师，可说是她全部经历中的最主要之点。在卫国战争初期，德寇侵占了她的家乡——斯大林省斯达洛贝舍沃村。她和她所领导的拖拉机队，都是驾着拖拉机撤退的。她说：“‘拖拉机’这一概念，对于我个人和全体苏联人民说来，不仅意味着‘带有内燃发动机的曳引机器’，而且具有更大得多的意义。拖拉机帮助农村革新了全部生活，它消灭了把土地机体分成无数段块的地界，它把千百万农民拖进了集体农庄生活中……”她对于自己能长期地作为一个女拖拉机师感到自豪。她说：“这不‘仅仅是我的职务’。这是我在为完成我国各届五年计划而斗争的位置，是我在卫国战争时日的战斗岗位，是快乐、丰裕、光荣的泉源。”
    的确，安格林娜是参加了苏联各届五年计划的斗争的。当她在一九三○年春做拖拉机师时，正是苏联紧张进行第一个五年计划的时候，“在辽阔无垠的苏联国土上，到处都有新建筑工程出现”。就全苏联来说：集体农庄运动，从一九二九年夏季起，就已经进到全盘集体化的阶段，在一九三○年间全苏联已经有了约六万名拖拉机师。布尔什维克党为了把农民从贫困的境遇中彻底解放出来，坚定不移地把这个运动推向前进。安格林娜的道路是多么广阔平坦呵！但事情并不是那样简单的。她说：“‘要当，就当成了’这句话，现在说起来当然很容易。但在当时一九三○年春天，这是多么困难，多么吃苦受罪的事啊！”原因是在这约六万名拖拉机师中，只有她一个女子，而她又是苏联第一名女拖拉机师。人们还不习惯于看到一个女人去做那种事。“信神的老太婆们依照神父的耳边细语，一看见‘不要脸的芭莎’穿着工作服在开拖拉机时，就吐起口沫来。”她有一次运粮，在路上遇着雷雨，她被摔下牛车，全村内就谣言四起，说“这是天老爷在惩罚芭莎”。不仅如此，连她的一些同事，男拖拉机师们，也讥笑她：“女人干不了什么！”甚至事实证明了芭莎的工作成绩超过其他同事时，还说要“提拔”她到汽油库去做发汽油的工作。总而言之，“女人是驾驶不了拖拉机的”。
    虽然如此，安格林娜并不灰心，因为她确切知道：“在发起任何一种正当事业时，都可指望党来支持。”事实正是这样的，党全力地支持和鼓舞了她。农业机器站政治部主任布尔什维克党员依万·库罗夫对她要成立“女子拖拉机队”的新方案特别重视。一九三三年二月十九日，斯大林同志在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说中，也曾经明确地指出：“妇女在集体农庄中是个巨大的力量。埋没这个力量，就是犯罪了。我们的责任，就是要在集体农庄中提拔妇女，运用这个力量。”（斯大林：“列宁主义问题”五五八页）
    正因为有了布尔什维克党和斯大林，像安格林娜所说，虽然在当时“我们集体农民虽还没有享受到新生活的果实，但已经坚决不渝地相信到这种新生活”了。安格林娜及其女拖拉机队一次又一次地创造出奇迹。她们的事业和成就，终于“发展成了一种能以影响到全国命运的全民的普遍现象”。到一九三九年间，安格林娜及其伙伴向全苏联妇女发出了
    “十万女同志去驾驶拖拉机”的号召，而起来响应的就达二十万人。这是多么雄壮的队伍啊！这个运动对于苏联伟大卫国战争有着十分巨大的贡献。
    安格林娜的奋斗过程为苏联妇女开创了一条创造美好生活的康庄大道。这对于今天的中国人民来说，同样是一个极其有益的启示。
    有许多生长在资本主义国家的人，对于在苏联国家内，为什么会有“雇农——拖拉机师——国务活动家”这样一个履历，是完全不可想像的。美国“世界名人大全”编辑部把安格林娜列入“名人”之列，竟荒谬地以为她的“飞黄腾达”和贵族院议员一类的人物没有什么两样，因而他们向安格林娜所询问的，当然不是她需要说的。她最需要说的，却是美国农民马丁给她的信中表示最关心的：到底由于什么在苏联一个不识字的雇农，可以变成了国务活动家？在“最主要之点”这个小册子里，作者对此作了透澈的解答。
    在资本主义国家里，劳动被认为是可耻的事情，当然这样的事就成了使人无法置信的奇闻；而在苏联，劳动却被人们认为最光荣的。安格林娜是以忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于党、忠于斯大林的高尚情操在劳动的。她在法定的每辆十五匹马力的拖拉机耕作三百公顷田地的定额下，向斯大林同志保证达到了一千二百公顷的工作额。到一九三九年，他的拖拉机队每辆拖拉机达到耕作二千公顷田地的高额。在伟大卫国战争期间，虽然德寇破坏了苏联人民的和平生活，但是安格林娜依然在农业生产战线上顽强地向“最高限额”进攻，“好像战争的命运是以此为转移似的”。
    安格林娜曾经多次会见斯大林同志，两次获得列宁勋章。她曾经以代表的资格，参加过批准斯大林宪法的非常第八届苏维埃代表大会。在斯大林诺市内，还有一条“芭莎·安格林娜”街。她的荣誉是说不完的。
    她说：“在我国，成为光荣的人——这就是从人民方面获得对自己劳动的崇高评价。”显然，这样的光荣并不是用“漂亮的一飞”所能达到的，而是要用“顽强的、奋不顾身的劳动，才能达到的”。
    苏联人民所需要的东西，是劳动，是和平，而绝不是战争。他们十分厌恶战争。
    安格林娜的女儿是在空袭声中生下的。因此，安格林娜以苏联千千万万孩子的母亲的资格，告诉战争挑拨者们：“不！我们决不想战争，决不打算炸毁纽约和窒杀美国农民马丁的孩子。”她并且说：“因为有斯大林，我们就有绝对把握瞻望着自己的未来。我们定能建立我们的幸福未来；必要时，我们也定能捍卫住我们的未来。”
    以上就是安格林娜在“最主要之点”中所说的自己生活中的最主要之点。在苏联能够有着这样的人的经历；在中国，在毛泽东的时代，也开始有了成批的女拖拉机师、火车女司机、女航空员、女工程师、女调度员……。新中国的妇女，已经接二连三地出现在从前梦想不到的岗位上。这对于发展生产，保卫和平，是一个巨大的力量。每一个人都将在自己的岗位上，把提高劳动效率，争取和平，当作我们今天生活中的最主要之点。
