Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Korean War Against Aggression

In the great struggle to defend world peace and oppose American aggression, the Chinese and Korean People's forces have not only heavily struck the frenzied enemy, but have also developed and grown stronger in battle. This is the heroic posture of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army heroes in the Battle of Ma Liang Mountain.

Thanks to the enthusiastic donation of weapons from the people of the motherland, the armed forces of the Volunteer Army have been further strengthened. The Volunteer Army heroes cherish the weapons donated by the people of the motherland very much. During the gaps in combat, they polish the cannons brightly, preparing to strike the enemy more effectively.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army anti-aircraft artillery units, in day and night intense operations, have continuously created new records in shooting down enemy planes, completely shattering the so-called "air superiority" of the American aggressors.

During the gaps in combat, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army helps the Korean people on a large scale to build dikes and dams and repair sluice gates. This is a "China-Korea International Friendship Dam" specifically named by the people of a certain place in Korea to thank the Volunteer Army for their contribution to building dikes and dams.

In the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea, the motor transport units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with selfless spirit, overcame numerous difficulties and completed the huge task of supplying the front lines with materials in a timely manner.
