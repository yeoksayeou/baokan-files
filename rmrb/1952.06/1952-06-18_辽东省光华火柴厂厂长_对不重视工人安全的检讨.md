    The Director of Liaoning Province Guanghua Match Factory's Self-Criticism for Not Emphasizing Worker Safety
    To the Editors: The People's Daily published a letter from readers Wang Tianxiang and others on April 2nd, criticizing our factory for not emphasizing worker safety. I believe their opinions are correct. Our factory has repeatedly experienced worker injuries, mainly because I was ideologically negligent and did not pay enough attention to worker safety in production. On February 8th of this year, our factory had an accident where worker Liu Qingnian's right arm was severed by a belt. At that time, we only held one meeting to investigate the responsibility for the accident. We did not seriously conduct safety education for the workers, nor did we take emergency measures to improve safety equipment. Therefore, on March 21st, another accident occurred in which worker Qu Huanzhang's finger was severed by a machine wheel. After this accident occurred and the newspaper criticized us, we began to improve our safety work. In April, we conducted a major safety inspection and found that many machines, buildings, and fire prevention equipment needed improvement. We immediately instructed the relevant departments to resolve these issues before the "May 1st" Labor Day. On May 2nd, I also made a self-criticism at the staff meeting for not emphasizing worker safety. In the future, we will continue to pay attention to this issue.
    Director of Liaoning Province Guanghua Match Factory, Zhang Yishan

    辽东省光华火柴厂厂长
    对不重视工人安全的检讨
    编辑同志：四月二日人民日报登载读者王天祥等的来信，对我厂不重视工人安全的现象提出批评。我认为他的意见是正确的。我厂屡次发生工人受伤事故，其主要原因，是我思想麻痹大意，不重视工人安全生产。今年二月八日，我厂发生了工友刘庆年右胳膊被皮带绞断的事故，当时只开了一次会，追查事故责任，并没有认真对工人进行安全教育，也没有采取紧急措施，改进安全设备。因此，三月二十一日又发生了工友曲焕章被机轮绞断手指的事故。这次事故发生以后，报纸又进行批评，我们才开始改进安全工作。四月份，我们进行了保安大检查，发现机器、房屋、防火设备需要改进的地方很多，并即责成有关部门，在“五一”劳动节前，把这些问题都解决了。五月二日，我又在职工大会上检讨了不重视工人安全的错误。今后，我们要继续注意这个问题。
    辽东省光华火柴厂厂长  张义山
