    The spring planting competition movement in the rural areas of Northeast China has come to an end, and evaluations are now underway, with preparations being made to launch a summer hoeing competition. The spring planting competition in the rural areas of Northeast China, initiated by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams led by labor models such as Han En and Jin Shilong, quickly received enthusiastic responses from farmers in various places. According to incomplete statistics from the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin, there are more than 51,000 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams participating in the spring planting competition. More than 1,300 villages in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces have also launched planting competitions between villages.
    The spring planting competition, with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as the backbone, has achieved many results: First, it greatly increased the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers for increasing production. All mutual aid teams and individual farmers participating in the competition formulated production increase plans centered on increasing yield per unit area. The production increase targets they proposed were generally 10 to 30 percent higher than last year's output, and some even exceeded it by 100%. Villages and settlements participating in the linked competitions between villages and settlements all achieved "no idle people in every household" during the spring plowing; some people who were usually called "lazybones" were also involved in the competition movement. For example, in Liangshan Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, all 770 households in the village, except for 13 households without labor, participated in the planting competition. Secondly, it accelerated the progress of spring plowing and sowing. The entire region basically completed large-field sowing in late May, about ten days earlier than in previous years. Thirdly, advanced production experience was promoted, and farming techniques were improved. Deep plowing and meticulous sowing were achieved in spring planting in various places. Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience has been widely promoted in the cotton planting areas of southern Northeast China this year. Songjiang Province also promoted the wheat planting experience of Lan Guohuan, a model of high yield in Shuangcheng County, the province. The selection of seeds, fertilization, and other tasks have also been strengthened in various places compared with previous years. Many mutual aid groups have also improved the soil of large tracts of low-yield cultivated land.
    The following good experiences have been gained in the spring planting competition in various places:
    (1) Regularly strengthening the leadership and inspection of the competition movement, and timely correcting the deviations that occur in the movement, is the decisive key to ensuring the normal development of the movement. For example, in Heilongjiang and Western Liaoning provinces, because the party and government leading organs paid attention to strengthening the leadership of the production increase competition and constantly sent cadres to various places for inspection, the competition formed a mass movement throughout the province. On the contrary, in Songjiang and Jilin provinces, because the leading organs relaxed the leadership of the production increase competition movement in the early stage of the competition movement, the development of the competition movement was very uneven. Later, Songjiang Province corrected the above-mentioned deviations, and the number of mutual aid teams participating in the competition in the province increased from 4,000 to more than 22,000. (2) Strengthening ideological education for farmers and overcoming the conservative thinking of "production increase reaching the top" that is more common among farmers is another important link in universally carrying out the production increase competition movement. In the early stages of launching the production increase competition movement in various places, they encountered resistance from various conservative ideas of farmers. More common was that the production increase plan was set too low, and some even used "competing is also farming, and not competing cannot throw the land away" as an excuse and were unwilling to participate in the competition. However, after repeated education, they finally broke through their conservative thinking, and many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams revised their production increase plans several times. (3) Use various methods to make the competition movement develop in an all-round way and create a boom. For example, the Second District of Heishan County, Western Liaoning Province, used the method of organizing a "production increase network" to quickly launch the competition movement in the entire district. Some villages in Yi County used the method of "grading and posting lists" to keep farmers in a full state of competitive enthusiasm. However, Tie岭 County was satisfied with the competition of labor models and key villages, which resulted in the competition movement being limited to a small circle of a few labor models and key villages, and failed to form a mass movement. (4) Solve the difficulties in the competition in a timely manner according to the needs of increasing production, so as to ensure the continuous and in-depth development of the competition movement. Chengde County, Hebei Province, mobilized farmers to launch a manure source finding movement to solve the difficulty of insufficient manure fertilizer, and ensured the in-depth development of the sowing competition. Minji Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, launched a reasonable loan between farmers to help households in difficulty solve the difficulty of insufficient means of production, so that all farmers in the village participated in the spring planting competition.
    At present, Northeast China is carrying out the evaluation work of spring plowing and spring sowing. The content of the evaluation mainly revolves around the requirement of increasing yield per unit area, checking the spring plowing and sowing plan, especially the degree of completion of plans to improve farming techniques such as manure application, seed selection, fine cultivation and meticulous work, and at the same time carrying out seedling inspection and seedling replenishment. The evaluation method in various places is to conduct mass inspection and evaluation in a guided manner. The competition between mutual aid groups is evaluated by village; the competition between villages is evaluated by district. Various localities will also use this evaluation to reward spring plowing competition models, discuss and formulate summer hoeing plans, and prepare for the launch of the summer hoeing competition.

### 东北农村组织春耕播种竞赛的经验

    东北农村组织春耕播种竞赛的经验
    东北农村春耕播种竞赛运动已告结束，现正进行评比和酝酿展开夏锄竞赛。东北农村的春耕播种竞赛，由韩恩、金时龙等劳动模范所领导的农业生产合作社和互助组发起后，很快得到各地农民的热烈响应。据黑龙江、松江、吉林三省的不完全统计，参加春耕播种竞赛的农业生产合作社和互助组，共达五万一千多个。黑龙江、松江两省并有一千三百多个村，展开了村与村之间的播种竞赛。
    以农业生产合作社和互助组为骨干的春耕播种竞赛，所获得的成绩是多方面的：首先是大大提高了农民的爱国增产热情。所有参加竞赛的互助组和个体农民，都制订了以提高单位面积产量为中心的增产计划。他们所提出的增产目标，一般都比去年产量高百分之十到三十，有些甚至超过了一倍。凡参加村与村、屯与屯连环竞赛的村屯，在春耕中都做到了“家家无闲人”；有些往常被称为“懒汉”的人，也卷入了竞赛运动。如吉林省舒兰县亮山村全村七百七十户，除十三户无劳动力外，全部参加了播种竞赛。其次是加速了春耕播种进度。全区在五月下旬已基本上完成了大田播种，比往年提早十天左右。再次是推广了先进的生产经验，改进了农作技术。各地的春耕播种，做到了深耕细播。曲耀离的植棉经验，今年已在东北南部植棉区广泛推广了。松江省还推广了该省双城县丰产模范蓝国焕的种麦经验。各地的选种、施肥等工作也比往年加强。许多互助组还改良了大片产量不高的耕地的土壤。
    各地在春耕播种竞赛中，已获得下列的好经验：
    （一）经常加强对竞赛运动的领导和检查，及时纠正运动中所发生的偏向，是保证运动正常发展的决定关键。如黑龙江、辽西两省因为党、政领导机关注意加强对增产竞赛的领导，不断派干部到各地进行检查，竞赛便在全省范围内形成了群众性的运动。相反，如松江、吉林两省领导机关在增产竞赛运动初期因放松对竞赛运动的领导，竞赛运动的发展便很不平衡。后来，松江省纠正了上述偏向，全省参加竞赛的互助组便由四千个增加到二万二千多个。（二）加强对农民的思想教育，克服农民中较普遍存在的“增产到顶”等保守思想，是普遍开展增产竞赛运动的另一重要环节。各地在开始发动增产竞赛运动的初期，都遇到了农民各种保守思想的抵抗，较普遍的是增产计划订得过低，有的甚至以“竞赛也种地，不竞赛也不能扔地”为藉口，不愿参加竞赛。但经过反复教育，他们终于打破了保守思想，许多农业生产合作社和互助组，几次修正增产计划。（三）利用各种办法使竞赛运动全面发展，造成热潮。如辽西省黑山县二区利用组织“增产网”的办法，使竞赛运动很快在全区中展开。义县有些村利用“分等张榜”的办法，使农民经常保持着饱满的竞赛热情。但铁岭县因为县区干部满足于劳动模范和重点村的竞赛，致使竞赛运动局限于少数劳动模范和重点村的小圈子里，未能形成群众性的运动。（四）根据增产需要，及时解决竞赛中的困难，以保证竞赛运动不断深入地发展。热河省承德县发动农民展开找粪源运动，解决了粪肥不足的困难，保证了播种竞赛的深入开展。黑龙江省绥化县民吉村发动农民之间开展合理借贷，帮助困难户解决了生产资料不足的困难，使全村农民都参加了春耕播种竞赛。
    现在，东北各地正在进行春耕春播的评比工作。评比内容主要是围绕提高单位面积产量的要求，检查春耕播种计划，特别是施粪、选种、精耕细作等改进农作技术计划的完成程度，同时进行查苗、补苗工作。各地评比方法是有领导地展开群众性的检查和评比。互助组与互助组之间的竞赛，以村为单位进行评比；村与村之间的竞赛，则以区为单位进行评比。各地并将通过这次评比奖励春耕竞赛模范，讨论和制订夏锄的计划，酝酿开展夏锄竞赛。        （新华社）
