Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 7th: The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 4th that twenty-five mothers and wives of British prisoners of war in Korea issued a declaration demanding that both sides repatriate all prisoners of war in order to achieve a ceasefire in Korea. The declaration called on all women who have sons or husbands in Korea to participate in a national women's conference scheduled to be held in the House of Commons on June 25th—the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War—to hold a demonstration. The declaration said: "This war has taken away our sons and destroyed our families." This war has brought unspeakable suffering to the Korean people and caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of their children. "Some of our children are prisoners of war in Korea. Our men could have returned home by Christmas, but the United States refused to exchange prisoners of war, and Britain has no say in the peace talks." The declaration added: "Our voice can help stop the war, bring our children home, and prevent the Korean War from escalating into a Third World War. Let us go together to see our members of parliament and Prime Minister Churchill and tell them that we firmly demand: peace talks should immediately bring peace to the world. Let us tell them that we demand an immediate exchange of all prisoners of war and that Britain send representatives to the peace talks. Britain must not completely entrust the peace talks to the United States. We will not allow this terrible war to continue."

    英俘家属发表宣言
    要求双方遣返全部战俘
    【新华社布拉格七日电】伦敦“工人日报”四日报道：二十五位朝鲜英国战俘的母亲和妻子发表宣言，要求双方遣返全部战俘，以便在朝鲜获致停战。宣言号召凡是有儿子或丈夫在朝鲜的妇女一齐参加全国妇女大会定于六月二十五日——朝鲜战争爆发二周年纪念日——在下议院举行的示威运动。宣言说：“这个战争夺走了我们的儿子，并且破坏了我们的家庭。”这个战争已经给朝鲜人民带来了不可言喻的痛苦，并且造成了他们的数十万儿女的死亡。“我们有些孩子在朝鲜做了战俘。我们的男人本可在圣诞节的时候回到家里来，但是美国拒绝交换战俘，而英国在和平谈判中却没有发言权。”宣言又说：“我们的呼声可以有助于制止战争，可以使我们的孩子回到家里来，可以防止使朝鲜战争扩大为第三次世界大战。让我们一同去见我们的议员和邱吉尔首相，并告诉他们，我们坚决要求：和平谈判应该立刻为世界带来和平。让我们告诉他们，我们要求立即交换全部战俘，并要求英国派代表参加和平谈判。英国决不能把和平谈判完全交托给美国。我们决不允许让这个可怕的战争继续下去。”
