Common Knowledge About Typhoons and Typhoon Warnings
Technician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Yang Jianchu

Typhoons are fierce storms originating from the tropical waters of the western North Pacific. They frequently strike China's coast during the summer and autumn seasons, historically causing severe damage to shipping, fishing, salt production, and the lives and property of coastal residents. Since liberation, to protect the interests of the coastal people, meteorological stations along the coast issue typhoon warnings whenever there is a possibility of a typhoon approaching. Governments at all levels then organize the masses to do their best in preventive work based on these warnings, which plays a certain role in safeguarding the lives and property of the coastal people. However, there are still a few cadres and masses who, due to insufficient understanding of typhoons and typhoon warnings, or through negligence and indifference, fail to actively prepare for prevention when a typhoon is approaching, thus causing unnecessary losses; or who are overly alarmed, and upon hearing a typhoon warning, without carefully studying the time and location of the typhoon's arrival, blindly scare each other, thus causing waste of manpower and resources.

Typhoons in the western North Pacific mainly appear during the summer and autumn seasons, especially in July, August, September, and October. Typhoons that strike China's coast also generally occur during these four months, so these four months are commonly referred to as the typhoon season. Although typhoons also appear in the Pacific during the winter and spring seasons, their winds are generally weaker, and they rarely affect China's coast. From 1880 to 1940, in sixty-one years, a total of one thousand two hundred and forty-nine typhoons appeared in the western North Pacific, averaging about twenty per year. The most in a single year (1910) was thirty-eight, and the least (1936) was only eight, with large annual variations.

On average, about five or six typhoons make landfall on China's coast each year. According to statistics from the twenty-nine years between 1912 and 1940, a total of one hundred and sixty-six typhoons made landfall in China, with the most in a single year being nine and the fewest only two. Among all the months of the year, August has the most, followed by July and September, and there are almost none from November to April of the following year.

Most of the typhoons that strike China's coast during the typhoon season make landfall in Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The number of typhoons making landfall north of Wenzhou in Zhejiang is small. On average, only one of the five or six typhoons that make landfall on China's coast each year is likely to make landfall on the coast north of Zhejiang. Typhoons that strike Fujian and Zhejiang often pass through Taiwan. An average of four typhoons pass through Taiwan each year, with as many as seven or eight in some years, making it the province most affected by typhoons in China.

A typhoon is a type of vortex in the atmosphere. The scope of the vortex can be as small as four or five hundred li or as large as one or two thousand li. The shape of this air vortex is approximately circular. The wind is very weak at the center of the vortex. Within five hundred li of the vortex center, the wind is very strong. Encountering this kind of strong wind, not only will fishing boats and merchant ships at sea be overturned, but ordinary houses on land may also be blown down. In the area five hundred to one thousand li from the center, although the wind is not small, the damage is relatively less. As for places beyond one thousand li, destructive gales are not common. In addition to strong winds, typhoons often bring heavy rain. Therefore, once a typhoon strikes a coastal area, there is often flooding after the wind disaster.

The area where typhoons are generated is the tropical waters of the western North Pacific. The vast ocean areas east of the Philippine Islands and in the South China Sea are the cradle of typhoons. After a typhoon is generated, it often moves westward or northwestward. In this way, after a few days or ten days, some pass through the Philippine Islands and enter the South China Sea, striking the coasts of Guangdong and Guangxi or Vietnam; some cross Taiwan and make landfall in the coastal areas of Fujian or Zhejiang; and some turn north or northeast near the Ryukyu Islands, striking Korea or Japan. The speed at which each typhoon moves is different, and the same typhoon also changes from time to time. Generally speaking, when it is moving westward or northwestward, it averages about thirty or forty li per hour; the process of changing direction is very slow; after turning, the movement speeds up, often reaching seventy or eighty li or even more than one hundred li per hour.

The lifespan of a typhoon rarely exceeds two weeks, and often it dies out in less than ten days. Short-lived typhoons even last only three days from generation to death. Typhoons that make landfall, if they continue to penetrate inland, disappear quickly. However, if a typhoon makes landfall and then quickly turns back to the sea, it is likely to get a chance to redevelop, so the areas it passes through must still pay attention to prevention.

Issuing typhoon warnings is one of the important tasks of meteorological stations. Typhoon warnings are divided into three categories: The first category is called "Typhoon Information." When a typhoon is born east of the Philippine Islands or in the ocean area of the South China Sea, the meteorological stations immediately pay attention to it, measuring its intensity changes, direction of movement, and speed of wind. According to its direction and speed of movement, predicting that it may affect China's sea area within one or two days, the meteorological stations issue "Typhoon Information" to warn ships sailing at sea not to navigate into the typhoon area, to avoid accidents. After that, depending on the situation, it is sent again every twenty-four hours or twelve hours. If the typhoon does not continue to invade the inland sea and detours away, the publication of "Typhoon Information" is stopped. The second category is "Typhoon Warning." When a typhoon has already invaded China's sea area and continues to move towards the mainland of China, the meteorological stations will issue a "Typhoon Warning." After that, it is sent again by telegraph every six to twelve hours, and relevant departments in various places are notified to step up defense work to reduce the damage that the typhoon can cause. The third category is "Typhoon Warning Cancellation." When a typhoon has gradually disappeared on land or turned away from China, estimating that it will no longer affect any area of China, the meteorological stations will issue a "Typhoon Warning Cancellation," stating that the typhoon has disappeared or left. After that, no more information about the typhoon will be issued.

The content of a typhoon warning generally includes the following items:

(1) The location of the typhoon center: This is the most important item in the typhoon warning. It describes where the typhoon center is at that time, usually expressed in longitude and latitude. If the typhoon is approaching certain islands, or is close to the coast, or has already made landfall, the location of the typhoon can also be described using place names.

(2) The intensity of the typhoon: Usually, only the sea level pressure at the typhoon center is reported, using millibars as the unit. When there is no typhoon, the sea level pressure in the tropical ocean area is around one thousand and twenty millibars. Once a typhoon occurs, the pressure drops sharply, and the sea level pressure at the typhoon center often drops below nine hundred and ninety-five millibars, or even lower. The lower the pressure, the stronger the typhoon. Therefore, the level of the sea level pressure at the typhoon center indicates the intensity of each typhoon. In addition, the intensity of the typhoon can also be expressed by the size of the wind force inside the typhoon. The greater the intensity of the typhoon, the more serious the damage it causes.

(3) The direction of movement of the typhoon: The areas directly affected by a typhoon are only within several hundred to one thousand li on both sides of its path. Other areas are not greatly affected. Therefore, in addition to describing the position and intensity, the typhoon warning must also indicate the future direction of the typhoon's movement, so that the areas it will pass through can prepare in advance, so this is also a very important item in the typhoon warning. The direction of typhoon movement is usually expressed in sixteen directions: north, north-northeast, northeast, east-northeast, east, east-southeast, southeast, south-southeast, south, south-southwest, southwest, west-southwest, west, west-northwest, northwest, north-northwest.

(4) The speed of movement of the typhoon: This is how fast the typhoon is moving in a certain direction. It is usually calculated in nautical miles per hour (one nautical mile is approximately equal to three point six Chinese li). For example, if a typhoon is moving westward at ten nautical miles per hour, then after twenty-four hours, the typhoon will have moved two hundred and forty nautical miles westward from its original position. Knowing the current location, direction of movement, and speed of movement of the typhoon, it is possible to predict where the typhoon will arrive at what time (but only one or two days can be predicted, because the direction and speed of movement of the typhoon will change).

(5) The intensity and range of strong winds appearing in the typhoon: In addition to the above four main items, the typhoon warning must also indicate the range of various strong winds inside the typhoon. For example, the warning says: At a distance of fifty nautical miles from the typhoon center, the wind speed reaches one hundred and twenty nautical miles per hour; at a distance of one hundred nautical miles from the typhoon center, the wind speed is eighty nautical miles per hour. This more specifically illustrates the intensity and range of the typhoon. Because each typhoon has differences in the size of the wind in its area, the damage caused also varies in severity. The meteorological station divides the wind size into thirteen levels. The higher the level, the stronger the wind. Winds from level zero to level five are relatively small and do not cause any damage; winds above level six have some slight impact, and winds above level eight may cause disasters.

(6) When a typhoon directly strikes China, the meteorological stations should clearly state in the typhoon warning issued which areas of China will be attacked or affected in the next twenty-four hours, so that those areas can make necessary preparations, and other unaffected areas do not need to panic excessively, taking unnecessary measures, to avoid wasting manpower and resources.

    关于台风和台风警报的常识
    中国科学院技师    杨鉴初
    台风是从北太平洋西部热带洋面来的一种猛烈的风暴，在夏、秋两季不时地侵袭我国沿海，过去对航业、渔业、盐业以及沿海居民的生命财产，常造成严重的损害。解放以后，为了保护沿海人民的利益，沿海的气象台站每逢有台风来袭的可能时，事先都发布台风警报，各级人民政府就根据台风警报，组织群众，尽力做好预防工作。它对沿海人民的生命财产，起了一定的保障作用。但是也还有少数干部和群众，由于对台风和台风警报认识不足，或者是麻痹大意，漠不关心。台风将到，不积极做好预防工作，因而造成不必要的损失；或者是过分惊慌，一听到有台风警报，不详细研究台风来侵的时间和侵袭的地点，就盲目地自相惊扰，因而造成人力、物力的浪费。
    北太平洋西部台风的出现主要是在夏、秋两季，尤以七、八、九、十月为最多。台风侵袭我国沿海也大致都在这四个月里，因此这四个月通称台风季。冬、春两季太平洋上虽然也有台风出现，但风力一般都比较弱，而且很少能影响到我国沿海。从
    一八八○年到一九四○年的六十一年中，北太平洋西部一共出现了一千二百四十九个台风，平均每年大约有二十个。最多的一年（一九一○年）有三十八个，最少的一年（一九三六年）只有八个，逐年变动很大。
    在我国沿海登陆的台风，平均每年大约有五、六个。根据一九一二年到一九四○年二十九年间的统计，登陆我国的台风共计一百六十六个，最多的年份有九个，最少的年份只有二个。全年各月份以八月为最多，其次是七月和九月，从十一月到次年四月的六个月里几乎完全没有。
    台风季里侵袭我国沿海的台风，大半都在福建和广东两省登陆。在浙江温州以北登陆的台风，数量是不多的。平均说来，每年在我国沿海登陆的五、六个台风，只有一个可能在浙江以北沿海登陆。台风袭击福建、浙江，多半要借道台湾。由台湾过境的台风每年平均有四个，最多的年份多到七、八个，这是我国受台风影响最大的一省。
    台风是大气里面的一种漩涡。漩涡的范围小则四、五百里，大的可以到一、二千里以上。这种空气漩涡的形状差不多是正圆形的。漩涡中心的风很小。离漩涡中心五百里以内地区，风力非常强大。遇到这种大风，不但海上的渔船、商船会被吹翻，就是陆地上一般的房屋也可能被它吹垮。离中心五百到一千里的地带，风力虽也不算小，但危害已比较少。至于一千里以外的地方，具有摧毁性的狂风是不常见的。台风区内除了大风之外，往往有暴雨。因此沿海的地方，一旦有台风侵袭，往往风灾之余，又是水灾。
    台风生成的地带为北太平洋西部的热带洋面。菲律宾群岛以东和南海辽阔的海洋面上就是台风出生的摇篮。台风生成之后，往往就向西或西北方向移动。这样，过了几天或十几天，有的就经过菲律宾群岛进入南海，侵袭我国两广或越南沿海；有的横过台湾在福建或浙江沿海地区登陆；也有的到琉球群岛附近就转向北或东北移动，袭击朝鲜或日本。每个台风移动的快慢，都不一样，同一个台风也时时有变动。一般说来，在它向西或西北方向走的时候，平均大约每小时走三四十里；改变方向的过程中，走得极慢；转向之后，移动就加快起来了，每小时往往可以走到七八十里甚至一百里以上。
    台风的寿命很少能超过两星期，往往不到十天就消灭了。短命的台风从生成到死亡甚至不过三天。登陆的台风，如果一直向内陆深入，就消失得很快。但是如果台风登陆以后，短时间内即行转向，回到海面上去，就很可能得到重新发展的机会，因此它要经过的地带仍必须注意预防。
    发布台风警报是气象台的重要任务之一。台风警报共分三类：第一类叫做“台风情报”。当台风在菲律宾群岛以东或者在南海的海洋面上出生之后，气象台站就立即加以注意，测量它的强度变化、移动的方向和风速的快慢。按照它的移动方向和快慢，预测一两天之内有影响我国海面的可能时，气象台站即发出“台风情报”，警告航行海上的船只，不要航行到台风范围以内去，免得发生意外。以后看情况每隔二十四小时或十二小时再发送一次。如果台风不继续侵入内海，绕道离去时，“台风情报”即停止发布。第二类为“台风警报”。当台风已经侵入我国海面，并继续向我国大陆行进时，气象台站就要发布“台风警报”。以后每隔六小时到十二小时再用电讯发送一次，并通知各地有关部门加紧防御工作，以减少台风所能造成的灾害。第三类为“台风解除警报”。当台风已经在陆地上逐渐消灭或者转向离开我国他去，估计不会再对我国任何地区发生影响时，气象台站就要发出“台风解除警报”，说明这个台风已经消失或者离去。以后便不再发布有关这个台风的情报。
    台风警报的内容一般包括下列几项：
    （一）台风中心的位置：这是台风警报中最应注意的一项。它说明台风中心当时在什么地方，通常用经纬度表示。如果台风接近某些岛屿，或者已经靠近沿海，或者已经登陆，则同时可以用地名来说明台风的所在。
    （二）台风的强度：通常只报告台风中心的海平面气压，用毫贝为单位。没有台风的时候，热带洋面海平面气压大约在一千零二十毫贝上下。一旦发生台风，气压骤降，台风中心的海平面气压经常降到九九五毫贝以下，甚至更低些。气压愈低，台风愈强。所以台风中心海平面气压的高低，就说明了每个台风的强度。此外也可以用台风里面风力的大小来表示台风的强度。台风强度愈大，它所造成的灾害也愈重。
    （三）台风的移动方向：台风直接影响到的地区只在它所经过的两旁数百里到千里之内，其他地区并无多大关系。因此台风警报中除掉说明位置和强度以外，更要指示台风的未来行动方向，这样就可以使得它将要经过的地带，预作防备，所以这也是台风警报中很重要的一项。台风移动方向通常用北、北偏东、东北、东偏北、东、东偏南、东南、南偏东、南、南偏西、西南、西偏南、西、西偏北、西北、北偏西等十六个方位来表示。
    （四）台风的移动速度：这就是台风向某一个方向走动的快慢。通常用每小时移动多少海里（一海里约合三点六华里）计算。例如有一个台风向西移动，每小时十海里，那末二十四小时以后，这个台风就从它原来的位置向西移动了二百四十海里。知道了台风的现在位置，移动方向和移动速度，就能推测台风在什么时候会到什么地方（但只能推测一天或二天，因为台风的移动方向和速度会改变的）。
    （五）台风中出现大风的强度及其范围：台风警报中除开包括上述四项主要内容以外，还要指明台风内部各种强风的范围。例如，警报中说：离台风中心五十海里的地方，风速每小时达到一百二十海里；离台风中心一百海里的地方，风速每小时为八十海里。这就更具体地说明了台风的强度和它的范围。每个台风由于它的区内风的大小有差别，造成的损害也有轻重之分。气象台把风的大小分为十三等级。级别愈大，风力愈强。从零级到五级的风比较小，不会造成什么损害；六级以上的风，稍有些影响，八级以上的风就可能造成灾害。
    （六）当台风直接向我国袭来时，气象台站就要在发出的台风警报中明确地说明未来二十四小时内，我国什么地方要被袭击或受到影响，使那些地方预作必要的准备，其他不受影响的地方就不必过分惊慌，徒作不必要的措施，以免人力、物力的浪费。
