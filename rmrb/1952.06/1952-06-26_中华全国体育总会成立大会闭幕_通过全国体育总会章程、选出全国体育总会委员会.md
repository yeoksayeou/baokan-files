Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: The inaugural meeting of the All-China Sports Federation successfully concluded on the 24th. The meeting unanimously elected Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government as Honorary Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation. Simultaneously, the All-China Sports Federation Committee, headed by Ma Xulun, was elected, officially announcing the establishment of the All-China Sports Federation.

This meeting summarized the achievements of sports activities over the past two years and defined the future direction and tasks. The guiding principle for future sports work is: based on the existing foundation, proceeding from reality and integrating with reality, to popularize and regularize sports activities, actively develop sports, enhance people's physical fitness, and serve to strengthen production and defense construction. In order to implement this principle, vigorously carrying out regular mass sports activities in grassroots units such as schools, government offices, factories, troops, and rural areas is the central task of the current sports movement.

The delegates attending the meeting listened to Rong Gaotang's report, "Strive for the Popularization and Regularization of National Sports," and unanimously approved the report on the spot. The meeting also focused on exchanging experiences in carrying out sports activities in various regions and grassroots units and adopted the Charter of the All-China Sports Federation. The meeting elected Ma Xulun as Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, Wei Que, Xiao Hua, Liu Ningyi, Li Dequan, Rong Gaotang, and Ma John as Vice Chairmen, and Fan Changjiang, He Cheng, Liao Chengzhi, Liu Zihui, Chen Yi, Kang Keqing, Chen Shaomin, and seventy-two others as members of the committee.

At the closing ceremony, Ma Xulun delivered a speech. He pointed out that this meeting had important gains, showing that the increasingly developing sports movement had taken a big step forward. He said: This meeting is broadly representative, which makes us even more convinced that sports is a major event related to the vast masses of the country and national defense and production construction. With the joint efforts of the broad masses of people, sports workers, and relevant parties, sports activities will inevitably be widely and smoothly developed. We must follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "Develop sports and enhance the people's physical fitness," proceed from reality, and actively and steadily popularize and regularize national sports. He emphasized that sports activities should be oriented towards the vast masses in grassroots units such as factories, rural areas, troops, schools, and government offices, adopt various forms, promote diverse sports activities, and advance the country's sports activities on the existing basis, so as to train and cultivate more physically strong, intelligent, and courageous defenders and builders of the motherland.

Finally, the meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
