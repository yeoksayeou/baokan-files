The vivid story of Communist Party member Habib leading the Dongxiang ethnic peasants to overcome drought and flood has spread to every corner of the Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Gansu. When many Dongxiang peasants mention Habib, they praise him, saying, "He is always seeking benefits for us peasants, truly a good Party member of Chairman Mao." Habib was originally a poor Dongxiang peasant. Before liberation, because the Ma Bufang bandit gang抓他当兵, he sold his only one mu of land to pay for it. From then on, he lived a vagrant life. After the liberation of the Dongxiang area in 1949, he returned to his hometown with the People's Liberation Army. At that time, the social environment in the Dongxiang area was extremely unstable, so he led the Dongxiang peasants to actively suppress bandits with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army; he killed a bandit leader and was commended by the local Communist Party committee. Later, he played an exemplary leading role in various tasks such as production and disaster relief. In April 1950, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Under the Party's continuous education and cultivation, he has now become a model Party member leading peasants to develop production. Last winter, Habib was transferred to work in Longquan Township. Originally, Longquan Township was a mountainous area where "a dry sheepskin won't stick to grass," frequently threatened by drought, and the yield of various crops was very low. The peasants in the township generally had the idea of "relying on the heavens for food." During this year's spring plowing, Habib organized the peasants to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy. He told the peasants, "Chairman Mao led us to divide the land, we must work hard and produce more grain to repay the motherland and Chairman Mao." When he proposed to the peasants a plan to increase grain production by five jin per mu this year, the peasants started to discuss it. Some peasants said, "Our place is dry nine years out of ten, and sometimes we don't even harvest enough seeds, so how can we increase production?" His proposal was rejected by the peasants. But he was not discouraged. He thought, "I am a Communist Party member and a cadre, I cannot bow my head to difficulties. As long as I discuss it with the masses, there will be a way to increase production." At the same time, he discovered that the key to increasing grain production in Longquan Township was how to lead the peasants in drought prevention and resistance. Therefore, he often studied drought resistance methods with the peasants. He used the specific example of old farmer Abudukelimu from Yaitouling Village digging a water cellar last year to accumulate mountain water for irrigation, which increased the yield by thirty jin per mu, to educate the peasants, and organized the peasants to visit the water cellar on the spot. Through his repeated publicity and education, he gradually broke the peasants' conservative idea of "relying on the heavens for food." Once their thinking was clear, the peasants in the whole township consciously and voluntarily organized themselves. Some dug water cellars, some opened mountain ditches, and a competition to dig water cellars was launched. After more than a month of hard work, water cellars were dug on every hillside in the township. Whenever it rained, the peasants were busy diverting the mountain water into the water cellars; when the crops needed irrigation, they released the water from the water cellars into the fields. In this way, all 18,000 mu of mountain land in the township was not threatened by this year's spring drought. From then on, the peasants also increased their confidence in increasing production. They said happily, "Habib's idea is really good. The place that used to be 'a dry sheepskin won't stick to grass' now grows good crops." It is estimated that this year, the township can increase grain production by at least ten jin per mu due to digging water cellars for drought prevention (twice as much as Habib's first proposed production increase plan), and the township can increase grain production by a total of 180,000 jin this year.

In April of this year, Habib accepted the order from his superiors to inspect spring plowing production in Hongta and Xinhua townships. At that time, he found that there were still more than 200 mu of land in these two townships that had not been sown. After his investigation, it turned out that the cultivated land in Hongta and Xinhua townships was bordered by a mountain ditch. In the past, because the Dongxiang and Han peasants were not united, they were unwilling to repair the ditches. Therefore, whenever mountain floods broke out, the fields in both townships were often damaged by floods. During this year's spring plowing and sowing, the local peasants left the 200 mu of land beside the ditch to lie fallow. After learning about this situation, Habib was very anxious. He thought, "If the peasants in the two townships are not united to repair the ditches and sow, the task of increasing production this year cannot be completed, which is a loss to the country and the peasants." Therefore, he went deep into every village and every household to educate the peasants that "peasants all over the world are one family," and used the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's Army fighting against the American robbers side by side to carry out internationalist propaganda. As a result, many peasants were greatly moved and joined the ditch repair. When repairing the ditches, Habib personally led the peasants to move stones and dig soil, which further inspired the peasants' enthusiasm for repairing the ditches. In ten days, eight flood prevention ditches were built, and more than 200 mu of barren land were also planted with corn and potatoes in time. Then he led the peasants to repair the ditch dikes. When mountain floods broke out this year, the flood flowed down the ditches without flooding a single mu of field, ensuring a bumper harvest for all the farmland in the two townships.

    领导农民战胜旱灾洪水的共产党员哈彼布
    新华社记者  吴玉森  王得温
    共产党员哈彼布领导东乡族农民战胜旱灾洪水的生动事迹，已传遍了甘肃东乡自治区的每一个角落。许多东乡族的农民一提起哈彼布，就满口夸奖说：“他处处为咱们农民谋福利，真是毛主席的好党员。”哈彼布原是一个东乡族的贫苦农民，解放前，因为马步芳匪帮抓他当兵，他出卖了仅有的一亩多地，顶了兵款。从此，他就过着流浪生活。一九四九年东乡地区解放后，他随着解放军回到了自己的家乡。当时，东乡地区社会环境极不安定，他便领导东乡族农民协助解放军积极剿匪；他击毙了一名匪首，获得当地中共党委的表扬。以后他又在生产救灾等各项工作中起着模范带头作用。一九五零年四月，他光荣地参加了中国共产党；在党的不断地教育和培养下，现在他已成为领导农民发展生产的模范党员。去年冬天，哈彼布被调到龙泉乡工作。原来龙泉乡是一个“干羊皮不黏草”的山区，经常遭到旱灾的威胁，各种作物的产量很低，该乡农民普遍存在着“靠天吃饭”的思想。今年春耕期间，哈彼布组织农民响应毛主席的增产节约号召，他向农民宣传说：“毛主席领导咱们分了地，咱们要好好劳动，多打粮食，来报答祖国和毛主席。”当他向农民提出今年每亩地增产五斤粮食的计划时，农民们纷纷议论起来，有些农民说：“咱们这个地方十年九旱，有时连种子都收不够，那还能增产呢？”他的提议被农民拒绝了。但是他并没有灰心，他想：“我是一个共产党员，又是一个干部，不能向困难低头，只要和群众多商量，就会有办法增产。”同时，他发现龙泉乡增产粮食的关键，就是如何领导农民进行防旱抗旱。因此他就经常和农民们研究抗旱的办法。他用崖头岭村老农阿不都克里木去年挖涝池积山水灌田，使每亩地增产三十斤粮食的具体事例教育农民，并组织农民实地参观涝池。经过他反复地宣传和教育，逐步地打破了农民“靠天吃饭”的保守思想。思想打通了，全乡农民就自觉自愿地组织起来，有的挖涝池，有的开山沟，开展了挖涝池的竞赛运动。经过一个多月的艰苦劳动，全乡每一个山坡都挖了涝池。一到雨天，农民们就忙着把山水引到涝池里；当庄稼需要灌溉的时候，就把涝池里的水放到田里去。这样，就使全乡一万八千亩山地没有受到今春干旱的威胁。从此，农民们也就提高了增产的信心，他们高兴地说：“哈彼布的主意真好，过去‘干羊皮不黏草’的地方，现在也长出了好庄稼。”据估计，今年全乡因为挖涝池防旱，每亩地至少可以增产十斤粮食（比哈彼布第一次提出的增产计划提高一倍），全乡今年共可增产粮食十八万斤。
    今年四月，哈彼布接受上级的命令到红塔、新华两乡检查春耕生产。当时，他发现这两个乡还有二百多亩土地没有播种。经他调查结果，原来红塔、新华两乡的耕地是以一条山沟为界，过去因为东乡族和汉族农民不团结，都不愿整修沟渠，因此每当山洪暴发，两乡的田禾常被洪水冲坏。在今年春耕播种时，当地农民便把沟旁的二百亩土地，任其荒芜。哈彼布了解到这个情况后，心里非常焦急，他想：“如果两乡农民再不团结修渠播种，今年的增产任务就无法完成，这对国家和农民都是损失。”于是，他便深入到每村每户，向农民进行“天下农民是一家”的教育，并且以中朝人民部队并肩打击美国强盗的英雄事迹，进行国际主义宣传。结果许多农民大受感动，纷纷参加修渠。在修渠时，哈彼布亲自带领农民搬石头，挖土块，更加鼓舞了农民的修渠情绪。十天工夫，八道防洪沟渠就建筑起来了，二百多亩荒芜的土地也及时种上了苞谷和洋芋。接着他又领导农民整修渠堤。在今年山洪暴发时，洪水顺沟而下，没有淹没一亩田禾，保证了两乡全部农田的丰收。
