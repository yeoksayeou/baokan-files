    Reader Raises Questions About Refractory Brick's Fire Resistance
    Editor: The People's Daily published the response of Li Xuesan, head of the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home, at the welcome meeting of people from all walks of life in the capital on May 25th. This response mentioned, "We saw at the Chengdu Exhibition that our motherland has produced refractory bricks that can withstand temperatures of 1400 degrees Celsius." I think this statement may be incorrect. The refractory bricks manufactured by various refractory material factories in our country (such as the Refractory Materials Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant) generally have a fire resistance of over 1500 degrees Celsius. Refractory bricks with a fire resistance of 1400 degrees are not of good quality. Please consider and research this opinion. Xu Jin
    Editor's Note: Reader Xu Jin's opinion is correct. We asked the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, which stated: "The fire resistance of refractory bricks has generally reached 1700 degrees Celsius, and at least 1580 degrees Celsius."

    读者对耐火砖的耐火度提出疑问
    编辑同志：人民日报五月二十五日刊载了中国人民志愿军归国代表团李雪三团长在首都各界人民欢送会上的答词，这个答词谈到“我们更从成都展览会上看到我们祖国已制出可耐摄氏一千四百度高温的耐火砖”。我认为这句话可能有错误。我国各耐火材料厂（如太原钢铁厂耐火材料部等）制造的耐火砖，一般耐火度都在一千五百度以上，耐火度在一千四百度的耐火砖质量并不好。这个意见，请你们考虑、研究。                徐进
    编者按：读者徐进的意见是对的。我们问了中央重工业部钢铁工业局，据称：“耐火砖的耐火度一般已达到一千七百度，至少也已达到一千五百八十度。”
