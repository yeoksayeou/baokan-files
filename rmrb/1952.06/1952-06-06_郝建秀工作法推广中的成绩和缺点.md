Economic Work Review

    Editor's Note: In order to systematically introduce the great achievements of our people on the economic front and solve various problems occurring in economic work, in addition to regularly publishing various news and articles on this page, we have decided to add a "Economic Work Review" column. This column will systematically introduce and critique the improvement of our country's industrial, agricultural, trade, and cooperative work, especially focusing on introducing and critiquing the promotion of various advanced experiences.

    Last August, the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government accepted the suggestion of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and decided to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method nationwide. In the past ten months, 90% of the roving frame workers nationwide have studied this work method. In Qingdao and Tianjin, where textile mills are more concentrated, 90% of the roving frame workers in most textile mills have learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The leading organs of the Qingdao textile industry pay more attention to the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, so the promotion work in the city has been done relatively well. Among the 301 roving frame workers at the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Mill, 254 are proficient in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method; more than 100 of them have surpassed Hao Jianxiu's record in reducing roller lapping (Hao Jianxiu's roller lapping rate is 0.25). All textile mills in Tianjin have promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but no systematic consolidation work has been carried out. Shanghai started promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method relatively late, and only began promoting it city-wide at the end of last November. Now, except for the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill and the private Shenxin No. 9 Mill, other factories have completed the promotion work. When textile mills in Wafangdian, Jinzhou, Dalian, Yingkou, Shenyang and other places in Northeast China began to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, formalistic deviations occurred because some leading cadres did not fully understand the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. The Northeast Textile Administration Bureau and the Northeast China Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China promptly conducted inspections and criticisms, and this deviation has been gradually corrected. At present, all roving frame workers in Northeast China have received training in the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Textile mills in the Northwest region have also widely promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and have achieved many results. The promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in textile mills in the Central South and Southwest regions has not yet become an organized and led mass movement, which should be noted.

    In the past, the roller lapping that could not be reduced for a long time in China's textile production has been generally reduced after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Before the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the average roller lapping rate in China's textile production was 1.85%, and after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, it has been reduced to below 1%. As a result of the reduction in the roller lapping rate, the country can produce approximately 26,550 more bales of yarn each year. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the output of roving frame yarn in textile mills generally increased by 3% to 5% compared to the past. The quality has also greatly improved.

    The workers in various textile mills have learned Hao Jianxiu's scientific operating techniques, have changed from being slaves to machines to being masters of machines, and have changed from blind and unplanned work to unhurried and rhythmic work, thereby reducing labor intensity. Guo Jinzi, a worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, used to run around the workshop and felt sore legs and back after work, and could not even eat; she still produced two or three pounds of roller lapping every day. After learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, she felt relaxed and happy at work, and the roller lapping was also reduced. The workers' ability to watch spindles has been significantly improved due to the implementation of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Workers in the roving frame workshop of the Yuxiang Yarn Factory in Hunan Province used to watch 216 spindles per person, but now they have increased to 280 spindles. Ning Shuzhen and Ma Shufang of the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill have even created a new record of watching 1,100 spindles.

    In textile mills that have promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, workers in other departments besides the roving frame workshop have also improved their skills based on the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, which has further helped the roving frame workshop to smoothly promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. After the Jinzhou Textile Mill in Northeast China promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the production of the slubbing workers could not keep up with the needs of the roving frame workshop; the workers in the slubbing workshop, based on the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, used the Guo Valiaofu Work Method and concentrated the technical advantages of 27 slubbing workers to create the "27" operating method. This operating method improved the technical level of the workers in the slubbing workshop and met the new needs of the roving frame workshop. Recently, workers at the state-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Mill have further developed the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and created a new roving frame doffing method, which further closely coordinated the doffing workers and the machine operators.

    A relatively common shortcoming in the process of promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in many textile mills is the failure to carry out consolidation work well. Therefore, the achievements of many textile mills in promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method have not been consolidated.

    Why have many textile mills failed to carry out consolidation work in a timely manner? The main reason is that many leading cadres have not truly recognized the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Even today, some cadres do not deeply believe in the superiority of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Under the call of their superiors, they reluctantly promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but they were not convinced in their hearts and always wanted to do something else. For example, the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill was originally a key factory in Shanghai for promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but the leading cadres of the factory not only failed to carry out the consolidation work of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method in depth, but also asked workers to learn another set of roving frame work methods. Some cadres saw that the Hao Jianxiu Work Method had been fully promoted in their factory and had achieved certain results, and thought it was "almost there"; so they relaxed their leadership over the "little teachers" and even canceled the inspection team. The state-owned Qingdao No. 7 Cotton Mill and the No. 1 Cotton Mill of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau have both experienced such situations.

    Due to the erroneous attitude of some leading cadres towards the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, they did not mobilize technicians to participate in the promotion work in order to help workers solve technical problems. Some workers learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, but many new problems arose, and no one helped to solve them, so their enthusiasm for learning the Hao Jianxiu Work Method slowly disappeared. Therefore, to do a good job in consolidating the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, we must first correct the attitude of the leading cadres and thoroughly eliminate these erroneous conservative ideas. Without such a prerequisite, there is no point in talking about promoting and consolidating the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    Some leading cadres of textile mills, although they also know the importance of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, have not mobilized the staff to do a good job in consolidation. They do not yet recognize that promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is a complex and meticulous task, a process of struggle between new and old ideas, and that widespread promotion is only the beginning of the matter. We must continuously carry out ideological education among the masses, improve the political consciousness of the workers, and transform the learning of advanced experience into a conscious action of the broad masses of workers. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the broad masses of staff to learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method be consolidated, and only in this way can the consolidation work be done well.

    The failure to change the old wage system in a timely manner and the failure to establish a new reward system in a timely manner have also hindered the in-depth promotion and consolidation of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. Many roving frame workers have learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and their output has increased and the quality has improved, but their wages have not increased accordingly. This is because the wages of roving frame workers in many textile mills are not calculated according to the actual output of the workers, but according to "hanks". Even more unreasonable is that the wages of roving frame workers in some factories are calculated solely based on their ability to watch spindles or according to their working hours, while the amount of roller lapping and the level of output have nothing to do with the amount of their wages. Therefore, there is no difference in wages between workers who actively learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to reduce roller lapping and workers who do not actively learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. This wage system is not in line with the principle of "to each according to his work" and cannot encourage workers to learn the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. After the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, the new reward system has not been established in a timely manner. Workers who perform well do not receive timely praise and rewards, which also affects the enthusiasm of workers to learn and consolidate the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

    Doing a good job in the consolidation work after the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method is a problem that many textile mills urgently need to solve. The leading organs of the textile industry in various places should conduct a focused and in-depth inspection of the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and criticize and correct the phenomenon of not paying attention to consolidation work. The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of textile mills that have already promoted the Hao Jianxiu Work Method should, in conjunction with the Hao Jianxiu group competition movement, treat the consolidation work as the central task of the current promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method.

### 郝建秀工作法推广中的成绩和缺点

    郝建秀工作法推广中的成绩和缺点
    编者按：为了系统地介绍我国人民在经济战线上获得的伟大成就，解决经济工作中发生的各种问题，我们除了在本版经常刊登各项消息、论文以外，现决定增设“经济工作述评”专栏。本栏将系统地介绍和批判我国工业、农业、贸易、合作等工作改进的情况及问题，特别着重介绍和批判各种先进经验推广的情况和问题。
    去年八月，中央人民政府纺织工业部接受了中国纺织工会全国委员会的建议，确定在全国范围内推广郝建秀工作法。十个月来，全国已经有百分之九十的细纱工人，学习了这个工作法。纺织厂比较集中的青岛、天津，大部分纺织厂中的百分之九十的细纱工人，已经学会了郝建秀工作法。青岛纺织业的领导机关，比较重视郝建秀工作法，因此，该市的推广工作也做得比较好。国营青岛第六棉纺织厂的三百零一个细纱工人中，已经有二百五十四人精通郝建秀工作法；其中一百多人减少皮辊花的纪录，已经超过了郝建秀（郝建秀的皮辊花率是零点二五）。天津市各纺织厂都推广了郝建秀工作法，但没有系统地进行巩固工作。上海推广郝建秀工作法较晚，直到去年十一月底，才开始在全市范围内推广。现在，除国营上海第十七棉纺织厂和私营申新九厂外，其他各厂都已完成推广工作。东北瓦房店、金州、大连、营口、沈阳等地纺织厂开始推广郝建秀工作法时，由于某些领导干部对郝建秀工作法的意义认识不足，曾经发生了形式主义的偏向。东北纺织管理局、中国纺织工会东北区委员会及时进行检查和批评，这种偏向已逐渐纠正。目前，全东北的细纱工人，都已受过郝建秀工作法的训练。西北区各纺织厂也普遍地推广了郝建秀工作法，并收到了不少的成果。中南、西南区各纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法的工作，还没有成为有组织、有领导的群众运动，这是应该加以注意的。
    过去，我国纺织生产中长期无法减少的皮辊花，在推广郝建秀工作法以后，便普遍减少了。在推广郝建秀工作法以前，我国纺织生产中皮辊花平均率为百分之一点八五，推广郝建秀工作法以后，已降到百分之一以下。皮辊花率降低的结果，全国每年约可增产二万六千五百五十件纱。推广郝建秀工作法后，纺织厂细纱产量，一般比过去提高了百分之三至五。质量也大大提高。
    各纺织厂的工人学会郝建秀科学的操作技术，已由机器的奴隶变成了机器的主人，由盲目的无计划的工作变成不慌不忙的有节奏的工作，从而减轻了劳动强度。国营天津第三棉纺织厂工人郭锦子，过去在车间跑来跑去，下班后腿酸腰痛，饭都吃不下；每天照常要出二、三磅皮辊花。他学习了郝建秀工作法以后，工作时感到轻松愉快，皮辊花也减少了。工人的看锭能力，由于实行郝建秀工作法而显著提高。湖南省裕湘纱厂细纱车间工人，过去每人看二百一十六锭，现在提高到二百八十锭。国营天津第五棉纺织厂寗淑珍、马淑芳，更创造了看锭一千一百个的新纪录。
    推广了郝建秀工作法的纺织厂，除细纱车间以外，其他部门的工人，也本着郝建秀工作法的基本精神，改进了自己的技术，这就进一步帮助了细纱车间顺利推广郝建秀工作法。东北锦州纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法以后，粗纱工人的生产赶不上细纱车间的需要；粗纱间的工人，根据郝建秀工作法的精神，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，集中了二十七个粗纱工人操作技术上的优点，创造了“二七”操作法。这个操作法提高了粗纱车间工人的技术水平，满足了细纱车间的新的需要。最近，国营上海第十二棉纺织厂工人，又发扬了郝建秀工作法的精神，创造出新的细纱落纱工作法，使落纱工和挡车工进一步密切配合起来。
    许多纺织厂在推广郝建秀工作法过程中发生的比较普遍的缺点，是没有很好地进行巩固工作。因此，许多纺织厂推广郝建秀工作法的成绩，没有巩固下来。
    为什么许多纺织厂没有及时进行巩固工作呢？主要的原因是许多领导干部还没有真正认识郝建秀工作法的意义。直到今天，有些干部还不深信郝建秀工作法的优越性。他们在上级的号召下，勉强推广了郝建秀工作法，但是心里并不服气，总想另外搞
    一套。例如，国营上海第一棉纺织厂原是上海推广郝建秀工作法的重点厂，但是，该厂领导干部不仅没有深入地进行郝建秀工作法的巩固工作，反而叫工人学习另一套细纱工作法。有的干部看见郝建秀工作法已在他们厂里全面推广了，而且收到了一定的成绩，就认为“差不多”了；于是放松了对“小先生”的领导，甚至取消了检查组。国营青岛第七棉纺织厂、西北纺织管理局第一棉纺织厂，都曾发生过这样的情况。
    由于某些领导干部对于推广郝建秀工作法采取了这些错误的态度，所以，他们就不去发动技术人员参加推广工作，以便帮助工人解决技术上的问题。有些工人学会了郝建秀工作法，但是发生了许多新的问题，没有人帮助解决，他们学习郝建秀工作法的热情，因而慢慢地就消失了。所以，要做好郝建秀工作法的巩固工作，必须首先端正领导干部的态度，彻底肃清这些错误的保守的思想。没有这样一个前提，就谈不到推广和巩固郝建秀工作法。
    有些纺织厂的领导干部，虽然也知道郝建秀工作法的重要意义，但是没有发动职工做好巩固工作。他们还不认识推广郝建秀工作法是一项复杂细致的工作，是一个新旧思想的斗争过程，而普遍推广仅仅是事情的开始。必须不断向群众进行思想教育工作，提高工人的政治觉悟，把学习先进经验变成广大工人自觉的行动。这样，广大职工学习郝建秀工作法的热情才能巩固起来，也只有这样，才能把巩固工作做好。
    旧的工资制度不能及时地改变，新的奖励制度没有及时地建立，也阻碍了郝建秀工作法的深入推广和巩固。许多细纱工人学习了郝建秀工作法，产量增加了，质量提高了，但是工资却没有随着提高。这是因为许多纺织厂中计算细纱工人的工资，不是按照工人的实际生产量计算，而是根据“亨司”计算的。更不合理的是：有些厂的细纱工人的工资，单纯按照看锭能力或按照工作时间计算，而皮辊花的多少、产量的高低却和工资的多少不发生关系。因此，积极学习郝建秀工作法减少了皮辊花的工人和不积极学习郝建秀工作法的工人，在工资上毫无分别。这种工资制度，是不符合“按劳付酬”的原则的，是不能够鼓励职工学习郝建秀工作法的。推广郝建秀工作法以后，新的奖励制度也没有适时地建立起来。成绩好的工人，得不到及时的表扬和奖励，这也影响了工人学习和巩固郝建秀工作法的热情。
    做好推广郝建秀工作法以后的巩固工作，是许多纺织厂迫切需要解决的问题。各地纺织工业领导机关，应该有重点地深入地检查一次郝建秀工作法推广工作的情况，批评和纠正不重视巩固工作的现象。已经推广了郝建秀工作法的纺织厂的党、行政、工会、青年团，更应结合郝建秀小组竞赛运动，把巩固工作当作当前推广郝建秀工作法的中心工作来做。
