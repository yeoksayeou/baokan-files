Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: Li Xiannian, Director of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project Committee, published a special article in the local Changjiang Daily entitled "Celebrating the Completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project According to Plan."

Li Xiannian pointed out: The successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is the result of the commanders, political workers, technical workers, medical personnel, cultural workers, especially the 300,000 military and civilian workers, transport workers, and machine workers who manufactured the闸门, responding to Chairman Mao's call to "Strive for the victory of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project for the benefit of the broad masses of people!" overcoming all difficulties and working day and night in a short period of time. The achievement of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship. We know that only under the leadership of the working class through its party—the Communist Party, only under the leadership of the People's Government, can it be done, can the partial interests be subordinated to the overall interests, can the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the north and south banks be taken care of, and can equipment and manpower be uniformly allocated. These things could not be done under reactionary rule. On the other hand, the construction and completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is a typical example of the joint construction of the motherland by workers and peasants. From the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, we see steel transported from the Northeast and Shanghai, equipment transported from Beijing and Tianjin, transportation tools transferred from Central South and Southwest, 闸门 manufactured in Hankou and Hengyang, a large number of engineering and technical personnel transferred from various places, and nearly 200,000 farmers from Hunan and Hubei provinces, which shows the great combination of workers and peasants and the combination of the masses. We see the greatness of this power from the rapid completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. The economic consequences of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project are conducive to the development of China's industrial and agricultural production, thus strengthening and consolidating the alliance of the working class and the peasantry.

Li Xiannian also pointed out: We know that in order to rapidly industrialize the motherland, in order to strive for a beautiful, free, and happy new life, we should adopt a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods to carry out the major construction undertakings of the motherland. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is a model of carrying out water conservancy projects with such a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods. In the course of more than two months of intensive construction, we closely relied on the masses and believed in the power of the masses, and only then did we quickly overcome various difficulties. We strengthened the organization and allocation of labor and continuously improved labor efficiency. In the reinforcement of the Jingjiang Dam and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, thousands of heroic model figures and units emerged. In addition, thanks to the help of Soviet experts, thanks to our emphasis on combining theory with practice, combining technology with the masses, valuing the creativity and wisdom of the masses, opposing the conservative technical views of the bourgeoisie, and fully absorbing Soviet experience, a mass movement to improve technology appeared in labor competitions and rationalization proposals. Engineers Wang Xiancheng, Li Fen, Ding Yu, Liu Yingzhou, etc., saved a lot of wealth for the country by boldly revising the original design of the 闸门 project and the steel reinforcement project of the 闸门 foundation floor. In terms of transportation, due to our breaking with conservative shipping views and successfully implementing the advanced Soviet "single-row towing method," we not only greatly strengthened transportation capacity, but also greatly shortened shipping time, thus completing the transportation task of equipment one month ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. In the construction of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, there are valuable experiences in all aspects, whether it is engineering technology, labor organization, transportation and storage, supply and sanitation, political work... and so on.

Li Xiannian finally pointed out: Our country is thriving day by day. The successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the Jingjiang Dam Reinforcement Project reveals the unparalleled potential power of our people, making us more confident in the large-scale economic construction and the beautiful prospects of the motherland that are coming!

    庆祝荆江分洪工程按预订计划完工
    【新华社武汉二十一日电】荆江分洪工程委员会主任李先念在此间长江日报上以“庆祝荆江分洪工程按预订计划完工”为题，发表专文。
    李先念指出：荆江分洪工程的胜利完成，是前后方的指挥员、政治工作人员、技术工作者、医务人员、文化工作者，特别是三十万的军工、民工、运输工人，以及承制闸门的机器工人，响应毛主席“为广大人民的利益，争取荆江分洪工程的胜利！”的号召，在短短时间内，克服了一切困难，夜以继日，紧急施工的结果。荆江分洪工程的成就，充分说明了人民民主专政的优越性。我们晓得，只有工人阶级通过他的政党——共产党的领导，只有在人民政府的领导下，才办得到，才能将局部利益服从全体利益，长江上游和下游、北岸和南岸才能照顾，器材、人力才能统一调拨。这些，在反动统治下是做不到的。另一方面，荆江分洪工程的兴建和完成，是工人农民联合建设祖国的一个典型实例。我们从荆江分洪工程的兴建中，看到东北和上海运来钢铁，京津运来器材，中南和西南调来的交通工具，汉口和衡阳承制的闸门，各地调来的大批工程技术人员，来自湖南、湖北两省的将近二十万农民的事实，便看出这个伟大的工农结合和群众结合。我们从荆江分洪工程迅速完成，看到这个力量的伟大。荆江分洪工程所产生的经济后果，是有利于发展我国的工农业生产的，因而它又加强与巩固了工人阶级与农民的联盟。
    李先念又指出：我们晓得，为了祖国的迅速工业化，为了争取美好、自由、幸福的新生活，我们应该采取革命的精神和革命的办法来举办祖国的重大建设事业。荆江分洪工程，正是这种采取革命精神和革命办法兴办水利工程的范例。在两个多月的紧张施工过程中，我们紧紧依靠群众，相信群众的力量，才迅速地克服了各种困难。我们加强了劳动力的组织与调配，不断地提高了劳动效率。在荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程中，涌现了成千上万的英雄模范人物和单位。此外，由于我们有苏联专家的帮助，由于我们强调了理论与实际结合，技术与群众结合，重视群众的创造与智慧，反对资产阶级的保守的技术观点，充分吸收苏联的经验，因而在劳动竞赛与合理化建议中，出现了改进技术的群众性运动。工程师王咸成、李芬、丁昱、刘瀛洲等，因大胆修正了原闸门工程和闸基底板扎钢筋工程的设计，为国家节省了大量的财富。运输方面，由于我们打破了保守的航运观点，实行了苏联先进的“一列式拖带法”成功，不但大大加强了运输能力，并大大缩短了航运时间，因而提前一个月，超额完成了器材的运输任务。荆江分洪工程的兴修中，无论工程技术、劳动组织、运输保管、供给卫生、政治工作……等等各方面，都有可贵的经验。
    李先念最后指出：我们的国家正在一天天地欣欣向荣，荆江分洪工程和荆堤加固工程的胜利完成，显露了我国人民无比的潜在力量，使我们即将到来的大规模经济建设和祖国的美丽远景，更加充满了信心！
