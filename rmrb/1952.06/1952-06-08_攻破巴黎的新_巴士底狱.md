Storming the New "Bastille" of Paris
Li Gao

Two years ago, the outstanding French peace fighter, Vercors, in his book "The French Republic in Danger," cried out: "We have entered the era of the Bastille (note). These Bastilles are visible, overbearing, and threatening us. We must storm them. They are an insult to us, a challenge, and the French people cannot endure them for long.”

Today, the "Bastille" of Paris, under the bayonets of the American occupiers and their French lackeys, appears even more sinister. After the Bidault government arrested French Communist Party Central Committee member and editor-in-chief of "l'Humanité," Stil, on May 24th, it arrested French Communist Party Secretary and National Assembly member, Duclos, on the 28th. Following this, thousands of French patriots were arrested. On the 31st, fully armed French police stormed the French Communist Party Central Committee office building, the French National Peace Council, and local Communist Party and democratic group headquarters, conducting an "unprecedented nationwide search operation" (New China News Agency). The police brought pre-prepared stolen goods with them, and the reactionary press clamored, "It is said that evidence of a conspiracy to harm the country has been found." The despicable trick of the "Reichstag fire" played by Hitler twenty years ago has been "reprinted" in Paris.

This event occurred neither too early nor too late, just after the so-called "General Treaty" and "European Defense Community Treaty" for the rearmament of West Germany, directed by the United States, were signed, and just as Ridgway arrived in Paris to take over as Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic invasion forces. Anyone concerned about world peace, anyone with eyes to see, can easily discern the inside story. This is why this event quickly aroused the anger of the people of France and the world.

For a long time, anti-communist dark dealings have been the prelude to reactionary rulers manufacturing large-scale war tragedies. Hitler's and Japanese militarists' "Anti-Comintern Pact" ultimately caused blood to flow from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Today, the cries of Washington's bloodthirsty elements and their accomplices are completely identical to Goebbels' tone. They are waving the banner of an anti-communist crusade, desperately trampling and ravaging people who yearn for peace and democracy wherever their hooves reach, and moving towards fascism step by step. In their plan to clear the way for their war chariots, the Communist Party and the people's peace and democratic organizations are always the first to be targeted.

The French Communist Party has two million members. During the last World War, they led the people in a heroic struggle against the German occupation forces, maintaining and developing the glorious traditions of France. In the years since the war, the French people have united around the French Communist Party and have been fighting tirelessly against the new warmongers. More than ten million French people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal; another ten million French people signed the declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. The French people have declared to the world their will and strength to defend peace. They indignantly tell Wall Street: Your war chariots shall not pass here!

The French people's desire for peace is not accidental. In thirty years, they have twice been thrown into the center of the disastrous vortex of world war. Not long ago, Parisian patriots distributed leaflets to the people. One leaflet reminded people, "In Colombes alone, the cost of the last World War was: 130 people were bombed to death, 80 were shot, 300 were exiled for political crimes, 800 were seriously injured, 2,000 prisoners, and 2,000 homes were destroyed." In fact, no reminder is needed; the French people will not forget the tragic history of war. The tears of orphans and widows have not yet dried, many ruins are still piled with broken bricks and tiles, and the wormwood and thorns in the vineyards still sigh in the wind for their diligent masters of the past. Yet today, someone is shouting to France: Tighten your belts, pick up your rifles, and charge with tanks from across the ocean. What more abominable language could there be than this that should be cursed?

The French people once welcomed the Allied forces landing in Normandy with blood and sincerity. But after the Parisian guerrillas handed over the capital, which they had liberated from the Nazi SS at the cost of their lives, they found that their country had immediately become an American occupation zone. The U.S. General Staff not only regarded France as a transportation zone and arsenal center, but also arranged it as a battlefield. Here is a naval base, there is an airport, and arsenals are everywhere. A French traveler will encounter "restricted area" signs signed by Americans everywhere. In places where American soldiers go, the best buildings become American soldiers' bars. The reactionary French government quickly stopped restoring housing for the people who suffered in the war and busied itself building barracks for the Americans. The Marshall Plan and "American aid," expansion of armaments and preparations for war, fattened the American bosses and a small number of French arms manufacturers who cooperated with them, but devoured the shirts and bread of ordinary French people. According to a report by the Federal Economic Research Institute, before the implementation of the Marshall Plan in 1947, the income of wage earners accounted for 40 percent of the national income; now it has dropped to 29.5 percent. And the profits of capitalists have risen from 34.5 percent of the national income to 54 percent. Military spending has truly become astronomical: 463 billion francs in 1950; 857 billion francs in 1951; and 1.4 trillion francs in 1952. Every French man, woman, and child has to pay 30,000 francs this year to feed the cannons, while real wage income has decreased by more than half compared to 1938. The production of peaceful industries is shrinking year by year, and hundreds of thousands of unemployed people are being thrown into the streets. Accompanying the Marshall Plan, 18,000 ordinary industrial and commercial households declared bankruptcy and closure, and 90 coal mines closed their doors. In the third quarter of 1951, French factories only manufactured six locomotives per month. People cannot help but feel that France's peaceful industry seems to be returning to the era before Louis XVI!

There are many other things that make French youth doubt their ears when they hear them for the first time. The radio announced to the people: The French government agrees to allow several West German divisions to join the North Atlantic "Allied Defense Forces." Many of the commanders of these armies are familiar names to French youth, such as Ramcke, Speidel, and Guderian. These Nazi generals, who once wore eagle-crested military caps and swastika armbands, constantly hanged the fathers and brothers of French youth in the occupied areas of France a few years ago. Now, the French government, obedient to the will of the United States, is trying to force French youth to raise their hands in salute to these Nazi generals whose hands are stained with the blood of the French people, listen to their command, and attack the Soviet youth who are joyfully singing songs of peace, building canals on the Don River to connect the five seas, reclaiming cotton fields in the deserts of Central Asia, and planting fruit trees in the Arctic Circle! What a great provocation and insult! French youth have to issue a declaration: "We will never be cannon fodder!" "We will never fight against the Soviet Union!"

Things are getting closer and closer to the moment of crisis. That plague general Ridgway, who makes French children afraid to cry at night, suddenly descended on French soil. As soon as this executioner, covered in blood and bacteria, arrived in Paris, he immediately promised: "He will promote Allied unity by using methods that have been tested in the Korean War and strive to establish a 'defense' of Western Europe" (Associated Press). What are these "methods that have been tested in the Korean War?" The facts of the past year have already provided an explanation for him: dropping tons of explosives and napalm on the homes, schools, hospitals, and nurseries of peaceful people, and spreading poisonous insects and bacteria on the sleeping chairs where the elderly rest and the cradles where infants sleep. This method is one that even the deceased Hitler could not have surpassed. However, it cannot but make French old people, women, and children disgusted. Therefore, the French people shouted in unison: "Ridgway, go home!" The French people cursed in unison "Executioner Ridgway!" "Plague God Ridgway!" Tens of millions of workers left their machines and ran out of factories, tens of millions of women put down their children and took to the streets, and tens of millions of farmers came out from under the grapevines. On May 28th, they launched a large-scale demonstration to protest Ridgway's arrival in Paris.

The American plague demon was shocked, and a small group of rats and flies in Paris, such as Bidault and Schuman, were even more panicked and trembling. Bidault, the leather merchant who shouted three months ago when he came to power that he wanted to "get rid of politics" and concentrate all his efforts on carrying out "purely technical" tasks, nakedly revealed the full appearance of a lackey. At this time, all the skills he learned from the Germans during the Vichy government period came in handy. Search! Arrest! Shoot! Arrest again! Shoot again! They thought the ghost of the "Bastille" would miraculously appear today. They thought that arresting the bell ringer would stop the sun from rising!

While shooting and arresting, they held emergency cabinet meetings, and long-distance telecommunications were busy. The police department planned to mobilize all its forces to "protect Americans and American property." However, the bloody hands of the butchers cannot stop the hands of millions of French workers from striking; the gunshots of the police cannot suppress the voices of millions of men and women demanding peace, freedom, and bread. Letters and telegrams of protest from peace-loving people all over the world flew to Paris like snowflakes. Hundreds of millions of eyes and hundreds of millions of fingers pointed angrily at Ridgway and Bidault. The ghost of the "Bastille" cannot save the war-mongers from failure! People must storm the new "Bastille" of France!

(Note) Bastille – The political prison of the French feudal dynasty, a symbol of autocratic dictatorship. It was stormed by the people of Paris during the French Revolution in 1789.

    攻破巴黎的新“巴士底狱”
    李高
    两年前，法国杰出的和平战士法奇在他所著“法兰西共和国在危难中”一书里大声疾呼：“我们走进了巴士底狱（注）的时代。这些巴士底狱是看得见的、盛气凌人的、威胁着我们的。我们一定要攻破它们。它们对我们是侮辱，是挑战，法兰西人民不能长久地忍受了。”
    今天，巴黎的“巴士底狱”在美国占领者和它的法国奴才们的刺刀下，更显得面目狰狞了。比内政府在五月二十四日逮捕了法国共产党中央委员、“人道报”总编辑斯梯之后，又在二十八日逮捕了法国共产党书记、国民议会议员杜克洛。紧接着，法国的爱国人民有上千人被捕。三十一日，全副武装的法国警察又冲进法国共产党中央委员会办公楼、法国全国和平理事会与全国各地共产党党部和民主团体所在地，进行了“空前未有的全国性搜查行动”
    （国新社语）。警察们搜查时把预先做好了的赃物带在身边，于是，反动报刊又叫嚷着，“据说已搜获危害国家阴谋的证据”了。二十年前希特勒所玩的“国会纵火案”的卑劣把戏，又在巴黎“再版”问世。
    这件事发生得不迟不早，正是在美国导演的重新武装西德的所谓“一般性条约”与“欧洲防务集团条约”刚刚签字、李奇微刚到巴黎接任北大西洋侵略军总司令的时候，每一个关心世界和平的人，长着眼睛的人，都不难看出事情的内幕。这就是这一事件很快地激起全法国以至全世界人民愤怒的原因。
    很久以来，反共的黑暗勾当早就成为反动统治者制造大规模战争悲剧的前奏。希特勒和日本军国主义者的“共同防共”，终于使鲜血从太平洋流到大西洋。今天，华盛顿的嗜血者及其帮凶们的叫嚣，和戈培尔的腔调已经完全一模一样了。他们打着反共十字军的旗帜，在他们蹄爪所及的地方，死命践踏与蹂躏渴望和平民主的人民，一步紧一步地走向法西斯化。在他们的清扫战车前进道路的计划里，首当其冲的总是共产党和人民的和平、民主组织。
    法国共产党拥有两百万党员。在上次世界大战中间，他们领导人民和德国占领军进行了英勇的斗争，保持和发扬了法兰西的光荣传统。战后几年来，法国人民团结在法国共产党的周围，一直在和新的战争制造者不停息地斗争着。一千多万法兰西人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名；又一个一千万法兰西人在要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言上签了名。法兰西人已经向全世界宣示了他们保卫和平的意志和力量。他们愤激地告诉华尔街：你们的战车在这儿通不过！
    法兰西人民渴望和平不是偶然的。在三十年中间，他们曾两度被抛入世界大战的灾难漩涡的中心。不久以前，巴黎的爱国者向人们散发传单。有一张传单提醒人们的记忆说：“仅仅在哥伦布，上次世界大战的代价是：一百三十人被炸死，八十人被枪杀，三百人因政治罪被放逐，八百人受重伤，两千个囚犯，两千所住房被毁坏。”其实，不用提醒，法国人民是不会忘记战争的惨痛历史的。孤儿、寡妇的眼泪还没有干，许多废墟上还乱堆着残砖碎瓦，葡萄园里的蓬蒿荆棘还在迎风叹悼往日勤劳开垦的主人。然而，今天又有人在向法兰西叫嚷：束紧你的腰带，拿起你的步枪，跟着大洋对岸来的坦克冲锋。还有什么可恶的语言比这更应该受咀咒呢？
    法兰西人民曾经用鲜血和赤忱欢迎过登陆诺曼底的盟军。但是，当巴黎的游击队员把自己拚着性命从纳粹党卫军手中解放出来的首都交出之后，他们发现自己的祖国立刻变成了美国的占领区。美国参谋本部不仅把法国当做交通地带和军火库中心，而且把它布置成为战场。这儿是海军基地，那儿是飞机场，军火库到处林立。一个法国的旅行者，到处会碰到美国人签署的“禁区”告示。在美国兵所到的地方，最好的建筑物变成了美国兵的酒吧间。法国的反动政府很快就停止了替大战中遭难的人民恢复住宅，忙着为美国人建造兵营。马歇尔计划和“美援”，扩军和备战，喂肥了美国老板和一小撮与他们合作的法国军火制造商，却吞噬了法国普通人的衬衫与面包。据联邦经济研究所的报告，在一九四七年马歇尔计划实行以前，工资收入者的收入在国民收入中占百分之四十；现在降低到了百分之二十九点五。而资本家的利润却从国民收入的百分之三十四点五上升到了百分之五十四。军费真正成了天文数字：一九五○年，四千六百三十亿法郎；一九五一年，八千五百七十亿法郎；一九五二年，一万四千亿法郎。每一个法国的老小，今年要付出三万法郎去喂炮，而实际工资的收入却比一九三八年减少了一半多。和平工业的生产一年一年在缩减，失业者成千成万地被抛向街头。和马歇尔计划伴奏的，有一万八千家普通工商户宣告破产和倒闭，九十个煤场关了门。在一九五一年第三季，法国的工厂里每月只制造六个火车头。人们不能不感到，法国的和平工业仿佛要回到路易十六以前的时代去了！
    还有许多事情，使法国青年初次听来要怀疑自己的耳朵。电台向人民宣布：法国政府赞成让几个西德师团加入北大西洋“联防军”。这些军队的指挥者中有许多名字是法国青年所熟习的，比如拉姆凯、斯派达尔和古德林，这些曾经戴着鹰徽军帽和卐字臂章的纳粹将军，几年之前曾在法国沦陷区不停地绞死法国青年的父兄。现在，服从美国意志的法政府却企图强迫法国青年向这些手上沾满法国人民鲜血的纳粹将军举手敬礼，听他们的指挥，和他们一道向欢乐地唱着和平之歌，在顿河上建造沟通五大海的运河的、在中亚细亚的沙漠上开辟棉田的、在北极圈内种植果树的苏联青年进攻了！这是多么大的挑衅和侮辱！法国的青年不得不发表宣言：“我们决不当炮灰！”“我们决不向苏联作战！”
    事情一步步迫近眉睫。那位使法国小儿闻声不敢夜啼的瘟疫将军李奇微忽然降临到法国本土了。这个浑身沾满了鲜血和细菌的刽子手一到巴黎，立刻就提出保证：“他将以在朝鲜战争中考验过的方法来促进盟国团结，努力建立西欧的‘防御’”（合众社）。这种“在朝鲜战争中考验过的方法”是什么呢？一年多来的事实早已替他作了解释：把成吨的炸药和凝固汽油丢向和平人民的住宅、学校、医院和托儿所，把毒虫细菌撒向老年人休息的睡椅和婴孩酣睡的摇篮。这种方法是可以使已死的希特勒自叹弗如的。然而，它不能不使法国的老人、妇女和儿童憎恶。因此，法国人民一齐喊着：“李奇微滚回去！”法国人民同声咀咒“刽子手李奇微！”“瘟神李奇微！”千万工人丢下机器跑出工厂，千万妇女放下孩子走上街头，千万农民从葡萄架底下走出来，在五月二十八日这一天，掀起了抗议李奇微抵达巴黎的大示威。
    美国瘟魔吃惊了，而巴黎的一小撮老鼠、苍蝇，如比内、舒曼之辈，更慌得发抖。比内，这个三个月前上台时嚷着要“摆脱政治”，集中一切努力来执行“纯技术性”任务的皮货商，赤裸裸地把奴才的本相全部露出来了。这时候，他在维琪政府时期从德国人那儿所学到的本领全都有用了。搜查！逮捕！开枪！再逮捕！再开枪！他们以为“巴士底狱”的幽灵今天会赫然显圣。他们以为逮捕了报晓的敲钟老人就能阻止太阳的上升！
    一面开枪，逮捕，一面召开紧急的内阁会议，长途电讯忙个不停。警察局计划着动员全部兵力来“保护美国人和美国财产”。可是，屠夫们的血手阻不住数百万法国工人罢工的手；警察的枪声压不住千万男女要求和平、自由与面包的呼声。世界各地爱好和平人民的抗议函电，雪片一样飞向巴黎。亿万双眼睛和亿万只手指愤怒地指向李奇微和比内。“巴士底狱”的幽灵挽救不了战争贩子的失败！人们一定要攻破法兰西的新“巴士底狱”！
    （注）巴士底狱——法国封建王朝的政治监狱，专制独裁的象征。一七八九年法国革命时，它被巴黎人民攻破了。
