    All-China Women's Federation
    Congratulates Women's Agricultural Bumper Harvest Models for 1951
    The All-China Women's Federation recently wrote letters to congratulate the women who won the title of Agricultural Bumper Harvest Models for 1951. These female bumper harvest models are: Li Tianying, a comprehensive bumper harvest model from Guangrao County, Shandong Province (the agricultural production cooperative she led won the honorary title of comprehensive bumper harvest model); Leng Yueying, a rice bumper harvest model from Dayi County, Western Sichuan District (the mutual aid group she led was named a rice bumper harvest model); Cui Yuxia, a wheat bumper harvest model from Suining County, Northern Jiangsu District (the mutual aid group she led was named a wheat bumper harvest model); Li Zhuqing, a soybean bumper harvest model from Lishu County, Western Liaoning Province; Lan Chenxiang, a rice bumper harvest model from Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province; He Sizhi, a rice bumper harvest model from Xingning County, Guangdong Province; and Huang Qingfang, a silkworm breeding model from Liyang County, Southern Jiangsu District. Their outstanding achievements in agricultural production have greatly encouraged women across the country to participate in the patriotic production increase movement. For this reason, the All-China Women's Federation specially wrote letters to these female bumper harvest models to congratulate them; and called on them to continue to work hard to create greater achievements and increase more wealth for the country. The original letter is as follows:
    Dear Comrades Li Tianying, Leng Yueying, Cui Yuxia, Li Zhuqing, Lan Chenxiang, He Sizhi, Huang Qingfang, and other bumper harvest models:
    First of all, let us here extend our cordial and warm congratulations to you for the new records you have created in agricultural production and for the glorious title and reward of 1951 Bumper Harvest Models awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government!
    Because you actively participated in and led agricultural cooperative mutual aid organizations, brought into play collective strength, improved farming techniques, and enabled women to undertake work suitable for themselves, you have created new bumper harvest records. Your glorious achievements have increased the country's wealth, improved family life, and raised the status of women, setting a brilliant example for women's participation in labor production!
    We earnestly hope that you will work even harder in the future: not be arrogant or complacent, consolidate and improve your existing achievements, constantly create newer bumper harvest records and experiences, and encourage more men and women farmers to participate in agricultural cooperative mutual aid organizations, produce more wealth for the country, and create a richer and more beautiful life for yourselves.
    Glory is yours, and also that of women and people all over the country. We are sincerely concerned about you. And we congratulate you and all the men and women farmers for continuing to work hard to strive for increased yields per unit area in 1952, to achieve greater harvests across the country, and to see the emergence of more bumper harvest models!
    All-China Women's Federation
