    Strive to Complete the Collection of Agricultural Tax in 1952
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has promulgated the "Instructions on the Work of Agricultural Tax Collection in 1952," which clearly stipulates that the guiding principle for this year's agricultural tax collection work is: "Implement land surveying and production determination, calculate and levy taxes according to rates, reduce or exempt taxes according to law, gradually realize unified progressive taxation, and abolish all surcharges." According to this principle, whether the agricultural tax collection work in various regions completes its tasks in the future should be judged solely by whether they have completed the tasks of land surveying and production determination, calculating and levying taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. In the future, governments at all levels should also use whether they have earnestly implemented the principles of land surveying and production determination, calculating and levying taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law as the standard for inspecting agricultural tax collection work. There should be no other standards besides this. The implementation of this instruction from the Government Administration Council will not only make the burden on farmers more fair and reasonable and ensure the state's tax revenue but will also further increase farmers' enthusiasm for production and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    Starting from the summer tax collection of 1952, all agricultural tax surcharges throughout the country will be abolished. In the future, agricultural tax collection will only be a single agricultural tax collected uniformly by the central government. This is a major reform of the agricultural tax system. In the past two years, because the Central People's Government was newly established, we had to first concentrate our efforts on stabilizing prices and supporting the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. For township finances, we had to temporarily allow local governments to manage them independently and collect a certain percentage of local surcharges in addition to the regular tax as the main source of income for township finances. Over the past two years, most localities have collected surcharges according to the proportions prescribed by the central government; however, many localities have increased the surcharge proportions due to insufficient funding for education and local administration. Some localities have levied grain and money in addition to the surcharges; and individual unreformed rural regimes have even inherited the Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and levies, arbitrarily collecting taxes from farmers. This phenomenon can no longer be allowed to continue. Now the state's financial situation has further improved. Abolishing the surcharge system, prohibiting arbitrary apportionment, and implementing unified management of national township finances, we have the initial conditions for financial work. Therefore, the Government Administration Council has timely decided to abolish all surcharges, prohibit arbitrary apportionment, and instead have the central government uniformly supply the needs of township finances. Governments at all levels, especially township governments, should fully recognize the significance of this decision, overcome certain temporary difficulties, and resolutely ensure the expenditure of certain funds, such as the expenses of village cadres and village government offices, the expenses of primary school teachers and primary school offices, and resolutely suspend certain non-urgent matters, in order to correctly implement this decision to the end.
    The Government Administration Council's instructions stipulate that in the future, the national agricultural tax system should gradually implement the principle of "unified progressive taxation." This is in line with the current rural economic situation. In the newly liberated areas, it is entirely correct to retain rich peasants during the land reform and implement a progressive tax system after the land reform. In the old liberated areas, land was largely evenly distributed among all classes during the land reform, so it was also correct to implement a proportional tax system at that time. At present, the rural economic situation in the old liberated areas, in the general trend of gradual rise, has undergone many changes; in order to adapt to the affordability of farmers of all classes, it is also entirely necessary and appropriate to temporarily continue to adopt the proportional tax system this year and switch to a progressive tax system next year. Now governments at all levels in the old liberated areas should immediately conduct publicity among the vast numbers of cadres and the masses through various means, explaining the fairness and rationality of the progressive tax system, in order to continue to stabilize and improve the farmers' production enthusiasm; at the same time, they should start investigation and research, draft plans, and conduct typical experiments to prepare for the implementation of the progressive tax system next year.
    According to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, the tax rates on cash crops should be appropriately balanced in the future. This is put forward based on the current agricultural production policy and the principle of fair and reasonable burden. According to the situation of agricultural production in our country, the yield of cash crops planted on the same land often exceeds that of grain crops by one to five times. In the past two years, cash crops and grain fields were taxed equally with agricultural tax, but the burden of cash crops was much lighter. This method has played a positive role in promoting the recovery and development of cash crops, so that the production of cash crops can largely guarantee the current needs of industry. The new problem that has arisen at present is that because planting cash crops is very profitable, many places have blindly developed cash crops, relatively reducing the production of commercial grain. Now the area of cash crops has developed to a certain extent; in the future, the focus of agricultural production increase is to improve the yield per unit area and prevent the blind expansion of the planting area of cash crops. Therefore, in areas where the burden of cash crops was originally too light, the agricultural tax rate should be appropriately increased in order to balance the burden on farmers.
    The Government Administration Council's instructions emphasize: "In order to stabilize the burden on farmers and reassure farmers to produce, it is necessary to implement land surveying and production determination, calculate and levy taxes according to rates, and reduce or exempt taxes according to law." This policy was implemented in most parts of the country in 1951. Land surveying and production determination are the basis for calculating and levying taxes according to rates and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. Over the past two years, the people's governments in most areas have been working very hard on the work of land surveying and production determination. But we know that rural work is very busy, especially in areas where land reform has not yet been completed, the work is even busier, and it is indeed difficult for them to spare time and allocate forces to carry out land surveying and production determination work. But this difficulty can be overcome. Last year, after the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China completed the land reform, it organically combined the clearing of land, determining output, resolving the remaining issues of land reform, issuing land certificates, and turning to production and democratic governance. As a result, all kinds of work were done very well. This is an example of completing land surveying and production determination work in conjunction with the completion of land reform and can be used as a reference for various localities. Today, the land figures in most parts of the country are not accurate enough, and the average annual yield is generally set too low (in some individual areas, it is too high). We must truthfully verify the land yield throughout the country in order to create good conditions for calculating and levying taxes according to rates and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. Only after the land is verified and the output is determined can the agricultural burden be fixed within a certain period, such as three to five years, and those who harvest more will not bear more burden, so that farmers can have a fixed plan every year. This is the best way to stabilize farmers' production enthusiasm and develop agricultural production.
    The work in the countryside in 1952 is very busy. It is now late June, and the preparation time for collecting agricultural tax is quite pressing. It is hoped that governments at all levels will follow the instructions of the Government Administration Council, seize the opportunity, immediately take effective measures, stop local surcharges on agricultural tax, prohibit arbitrary apportionment, combine production, publicize the policy of agricultural tax collection, and choose an appropriate time to carry out land surveying and production determination work. In the summer tax collection areas, it is necessary to organize forces and immediately invest in the summer tax collection work. Agricultural tax work is not only a financial work but also a major political task, which is a major event related to more than 400 million farmers. The staff of governments at all levels must fully recognize the importance of the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on the Work of Agricultural Tax Collection in 1952" and fight for the implementation of these instructions!

### 努力完成一九五二年农业税的征收工作

    努力完成一九五二年农业税的征收工作
    中央人民政府政务院公布了“关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示”，明确规定今年农业税收工作的方针是：“贯彻查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，逐步实现统一累进，并取消一切附加。”根据这个方针，今后各地农业税收工作是否完成任务，其唯一正确的标准，应当看他们是否完成查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的任务。今后各级人民政府检查农业税收工作，也应该以是否认真执行了查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的方针为标准。除此以外，不能再有其他标准。对于政务院的这一指示的贯彻执行，不仅可以使农民的负担更加公平合理，使国家的税收更有保证，而且将会进一步提高农民生产的积极性，巩固工农联盟。
    从一九五二年夏征开始，全国各地的农业税附加即将一律取消。今后农业税收，只由中央统一征收一种农业税。这是农业税收制度的一个重大改革。在过去的两年间，由于中央人民政府成立不久，当时我们还必须首先集中力量于稳定物价和支援抗美援朝，对于乡镇财政，不得不暂由地方自行管理，在正税之外，征收一定比例的地方附加，作为乡镇财政的主要收入。两年以来，多数地方是按照中央规定的附加比例征收的；但也有不少地方，由于教育经费和地方行政费的不足，增加了附加比例；有些地方并在附加之外，另派粮款；个别未经改造的乡村政权，甚至承袭了国民党的苛捐杂税，任意向农民征收。这种现象是不能再让其继续下去的。现在国家财政情况已经进一步好转，取消附加制度，禁止任意摊派，实行全国乡镇财政的统一管理，在财政工作方面已经具备了初步的条件。因此，政务院及时决定取消一切附加，禁止任意摊派，而由中央统一供给乡镇财政的需要。各级人民政府，特别是乡镇人民政府，应该充分认识这一决定的重大意义，克服某些暂时的困难，坚决保证某些经费如乡村干部和乡村政府办公费、小学教职员经费和小学办公费等的开支，坚决停办某些并非急要的事务，以便把这一决定，正确地贯彻执行到底。
    政务院的指示中规定：今后全国农业税的税制，应当逐步实行“统一累进”的原则。这是符合于当前的农村经济情况的。晚解放的地区，在土地改革中保留了富农，在土地改革后实行累进税制，是完全正确的。老解放区土地改革时，各阶层的土地大体上平分了，因此，在当时实行比例税制，也是正确的。目前老解放区的农村经济状况，在逐渐上升的总趋势中，已经发生了不少变化；为了适应各阶层农民的负担能力，在今年暂时继续采行比例税制，到明年改行累进税制，这也是完全必要和适宜的。现在老解放区各级人民政府，应该立即通过各种方式，向广大干部和群众进行宣传，说明累进税制的公平合理，以便继续稳定并提高农民的生产情绪；同时着手调查研究，草拟方案，进行典型试验，为明年实行累进税制做好准备。
    依照政务院的指示，今后要适当地平衡经济作物的税率。这是根据当前的农业生产方针和公平合理的负担原则提出的。根据我国农业生产的情况，以同等土地种植经济作物，其产量往往超过粮食作物的一倍至五倍。过去两年来，经济作物和粮田同样计征农业税，而经济作物的负担要轻得多。这种办法，对于推动经济作物的恢复和发展，曾起了积极的作用，使经济作物的生产，大体可以保证目前工业上的需要。现时发生的新的问题是：由于种植经济作物非常有利，因而有许多地方盲目发展经济作物，相对减少了商品粮食的生产量。现在经济作物的面积已发展到一定的程度；今后农业增产的重点是提高单位面积产量，防止盲目扩大经济作物的种植面积。因此，凡是原来经济作物负担过轻的地区，其农业税率应当适当地加以提高，以便平衡农民的负担。
    政务院指示着重指出：“为了稳定农民负担，使农民安心生产，就必须实行查田定产、依率计征、依法减免”。这个方针，一九五一年已在全国大部地区实行。查田定产是依率计征和依法减免的基础。两年以来，大部地区的人民政府，对查田定产工作是抓得很紧的。但我们知道农村工作很忙，特别是在土地改革尚未完成的地区，工作更忙，他们再要抽出时间、调配力量进行查田定产工作，确有困难。但这种困难是可以克服的。去年中共陕西省委员会在完成土地改革之后，把清丈土地、订定产量和解决土地改革的遗留问题、颁发土地证、转入生产和民主建政，有机地结合起来，结果各种工作都作得很好。这是结合土地改革完成查田定产工作的一个范例，可资各地参考。今天全国大部地区的田亩数字，还不够真实，常年应产量一般是订得偏低的（也有个别地区偏高）。我们必须实事求是地把全国的土地产量核定真实，以便为依率计征和依法减免造成良好的条件。只有把田亩查实、产量定好之后，才可以在一定时期之内，比如在三五年内，把农业负担固定下来，多收者不多负担，使农民每年可以有一个固定计划。这是稳定农民生产情绪，发展农业生产的最好办法。
    一九五二年农村中的工作是很繁忙的。现在已是六月下旬，征收农业税的准备时间已经相当紧迫。希望各级人民政府遵照政务院的指示，抓紧时机，立即采取有效办法，停止农业税的地方附加，禁止任意摊派，结合生产，宣传农业税征收的政策，选择适当时机，开展查田定产工作。在夏征地区必须组织力量，立即投入夏征工作。农业税工作不仅是一个财政工作，而且是一个重大的政治任务，是关系四亿多农民的大事。各级人民政府的工作人员，必须充分认识政务院“关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示”的重要性，为贯彻实施这一指示而斗争！
