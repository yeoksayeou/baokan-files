Title: Temporarily Unused Land in the Suburbs Should Be Distributed to Farmers for Cultivation

To the Editor:

There are over 1,000 mu of fertile land in Beiyuan, in the northern suburbs of Beijing, which are currently lying barren. This land was confiscated and nationalized during the land reform in the suburbs and distributed to the farmers in nearby villages for cultivation. In December 1951, the People's Government reclaimed this land for basic construction projects with appropriate compensation. However, several months have passed, and construction has not yet begun. Over 1,000 mu of fertile land, except for a few small trees, are completely barren. If early-harvest crops (such as peas and barley) had been planted, they would be ready for harvest now. This is a significant loss for the country.

I believe that if the government is not going to begin construction on this land this year, it should seize the time and immediately distribute this land to the farmers in nearby villages for temporary cultivation under reasonable conditions. If corn and beans are planted now, each mu can yield at least 80 jin of grain, excluding labor and material costs. One thousand mu of land could add 80,000 jin of grain to the country's wealth. This will prevent the land from being barren and will not affect the government's construction next year. I hope that the relevant authorities will quickly resolve this issue.

A Farmer from the Fourteenth District of Beijing

Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from a farmer in the Fourteenth District of Beijing, we immediately conducted an investigation in the area and discussed the issue with the relevant authorities. In the past, some organizations applied for excessive amounts of suburban construction land from the Beijing Municipal People's Government. The authorities responsible for reviewing these applications did not exercise strict control, resulting in an over-allocation of land. Many organizations did not start construction immediately after receiving the land, leading to the abandonment of much cultivated land and causing unnecessary losses to the country.

To correct this phenomenon, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued a notice to all relevant units in March of this year, stating that "land not scheduled for construction until after the autumn harvest should be temporarily handed over directly to the local district government at no cost, to be organized for cultivation by local farmers." Some units have implemented this regulation, but a few have not. The land in the northern suburbs mentioned in the reader's letter was requisitioned by a certain school of the People's Liberation Army. The school requisitioned over 1,100 mu of land in November 1951, but only used 300 mu at the time. After receiving the notice from the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the school only handed over a little more than 10 mu of land and has not returned the remaining 800 mu.

We suggest that the school immediately hand over the land to the local district government to organize farmers to cultivate it, to prevent the land from continuing to lie barren. In the future, when various construction units apply for construction land, they must conscientiously prepare construction plans, and the competent authorities should carefully review the applications during the approval process, so that this wasteful phenomenon does not occur again.

### 市郊暂不兴工的土地应该分给农民耕种

    市郊暂不兴工的土地应该分给农民耕种
    编辑同志：北京市北郊北苑有一千多亩土质很好的土地，现在被荒芜着。这些土地在郊区土地改革时，已经收归国有，分配给附近各村农民耕种。一九五一年十二月，人民政府为了在该地进行基本建设，就用适当代价收回了。但至今数月，尚未施工。一千多亩良田，除了有寥寥几株小树外，完全荒芜了。如果这些土地种上早收作物（如豌豆、大麦等），现在都要收割了。这对国家是一个很大的损失。
    我认为，政府如果今年还不在这些土地上动工建筑，应该抓紧时间，立刻在合理的条件下，把这些土地分给附近各村农民暂时耕种。如果现在种上玉米、豆子，每亩除工料外，最低可以收获八十市斤粮食，一千亩土地，就能给国家增添八万斤粮食的财富。这既免得土地荒芜，也不致影响政府来年的建筑。希望有关机关迅速解决这个问题。
    北京市十四区一农民
    编者按：我们接到北京市十四区一农民的来
    信后，马上到当地进行了调查，并和有关机关
    研究了这个问题。过去某些机关向北京市人民政府领用郊区建设用地时，申请的数目太多；负责审查的机关，又没有给以严格的控制，这就形成了领用土地过多的现象。许多机关领用土地后，又不立即施工，以致很多耕地荒芜起来，给国家造成不应有的损失。
    为了纠正这种现象，北京市人民政府曾在今年三月，通知各有关单位，把“在秋后始行建设之土地，一律无代价地直接暂交当地区政府，组织当地农民耕种”。有些单位执行了这一规定，但有少数单位，还没有执行这一规定。这封读者来信指出的北郊的土地，是解放军某学校领用的。该校在一九五一年十一月，领用土地一千一百余亩，当时只用了三百多亩。该校在接到北京市人民政府的通知后，只交出土地十余亩，其余八百多亩土地则迄未交出。
    我们建议该校立即把土地暂交当地区政府，组织农民耕种，以免土地继续荒芜。今后各兴建单位领用建设用地时，必须认真作好建设计划，主管机关在批准用地时，亦应慎重审查，使这种浪费现象不再发生。
