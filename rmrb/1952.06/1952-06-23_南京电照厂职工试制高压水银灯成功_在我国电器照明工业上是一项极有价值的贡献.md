    Nanjing Electric Lighting Factory Workers Successfully Trial-Produce High-Pressure Mercury Lamps
    An Extremely Valuable Contribution to China's Electrical Lighting Industry

    Following their successful trial production of fluorescent powder and fluorescent lamps in May, the workers of the Nanjing Electric Lighting Factory, under the leadership of labor model and engineer Yin Yousan, have victoriously completed the trial production of high-pressure mercury lamps. This is an extremely valuable contribution to China's electrical lighting industry.

    High-pressure mercury lamps are still a novelty in China, and they have great value in China's industrial construction. This type of light bulb has a very strong luminous intensity. One 500-candlepower high-pressure mercury lamp is four times brighter than a 500-candlepower ordinary light bulb. This greatly helps save electricity for industrial power. Another feature of this light bulb is that its lifespan is five times longer than that of ordinary light bulbs, and the cost is lower than that of ordinary light bulbs. The bright and dazzling light of high-pressure mercury lamps is suitable for outdoor squares.

    During the trial production of high-pressure mercury lamps, the factory workers, under the leadership and encouragement of labor model Yin Yousan, overcame numerous difficulties. They were not afraid of repeated failures and finally succeeded in the trial production after four months. The testing of each component of the high-pressure mercury lamp was carried out under very rudimentary conditions, with dozens of tests required for each success. Ordinary light bulbs emit light by burning tungsten filaments, while high-pressure mercury lamps emit light by electrons emitted from the filament colliding with mercury vapor inside the bulb. Therefore, to make the mercury lamp emit a strong light, the filament needs to be able to emit electrons. This is a very important step. To make the filament emit electrons, it is necessary to use high-voltage electricity to shock the filament. However, the Nanjing Electric Lighting Factory did not have such equipment. The workers solved this problem by passing electricity through the filament. However, as soon as the electricity was turned on, a chemical powder coated on the filament peeled off, completely losing its effectiveness. Master worker He Shande tried twenty or thirty times, all of which failed. But he never lost heart and continued to study diligently, finally finding a solution. He wrapped two filaments together and passed current through them. In this way, the filaments could emit electrons.

    During the entire trial production process, the workers received help from many comrades. For example, high-pressure mercury lamps require special glass shells that can withstand high temperatures, but the ordinary glass shells produced by the factory's glass workshop soften and deform at a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius. In order to formulate a suitable special glass shell, technician Zhang Jianxun and the master workers of the glass workshop worked together and, after many experiments, finally produced a heat-resistant glass, solving the problem of the inner glass shell and strongly supporting the trial production of high-pressure mercury lamps.

    The factory workers are now continuing to research and improve the lamps, and have already sent samples to the Guangzhou Street Light Management Office for trial use to solicit opinions. After further improvements, they will proceed to mass production.

### 南京电照厂职工试制高压水银灯成功  在我国电器照明工业上是一项极有价值的贡献

    南京电照厂职工试制高压水银灯成功
    在我国电器照明工业上是一项极有价值的贡献
    南京电照厂职工在五月里试制荧光粉、荧光灯成功以后，又在劳动模范、工程师尹友三领导下，胜利地完成了高压水银灯的试制工作。这在我国电器照明工业上是一项极有价值的贡献。
    高压水银灯在我国还是新奇的东西，它在我国工业建设中具有很大的价值。这种灯泡的光度很强，一只五百支光的高压水银灯泡，四倍于五百支光的普通灯泡，这对节省电力以供给工业动力，有很大的帮助。这种灯泡的另一个特点是，它的使用寿命比较普通灯泡要长五倍，而且成本比普通灯泡低。高压水银灯的光亮灿烂夺目，适用于户外广场上。
    在试制高压水银灯的过程中，该厂职工在劳动模范尹友三的领导和鼓励下，克服了重重的困难，不怕屡次失败，经过四个月的时间，终于试制成功。高压水银灯的每一个组成部分的试验，都是在设备很简陋的情况下，经过数十次的试验才获得成功的。普通灯泡是由于电力燃烧了钨丝而发亮的，高压水银灯是由于灯丝发出的电子和内层的水银气冲击后发光的，所以要水银灯发出强的光亮，就需要灯丝能发出电子。这是很重要的环节。要让灯丝发出电子，必须用高压电冲击灯丝。但南京电照厂没有这种设备。职工们就在灯丝上通电来解决这个问题，但电一通上去，涂在灯丝上的一种化学药粉就给剥落下来了，这样就完全失去了效用。老师傅贺善德试验了二、三十次，都失败了。但他始终不灰心，继续苦心钻研，终于找到了门路。他把两条灯丝绕起来通电流，这样一来灯丝就能发出电子了。
    工人在整个试制过程中，得到了许多同志的帮助。譬如高压水银灯需要能耐高热的特种玻壳，而该厂玻璃工场所出的普通玻壳，在摄氏五百度的温度下就软化变形。为了配制合适的特种玻壳，玻璃工场技术员张建勋和老师傅们共同研究，经过许多次的试验，终于制出了能耐高热的玻璃，解决了内层玻壳的问题，有力地支援了高压水银灯的试制工作。
    该厂职工现在仍在继续研究改进，并已经把样品寄给广州市路灯管理所试用，征求意见，准备再作进一步改进后，即行大量生产。
