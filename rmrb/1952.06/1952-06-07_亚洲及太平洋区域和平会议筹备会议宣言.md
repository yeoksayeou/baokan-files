We, the forty-seven representatives from twenty countries in Asia, Australia, South America, and North America attending this preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing from June 3 to 6, 1952, make an urgent appeal to the people of the Asian and Pacific Regions: Peoples of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions, unite, strengthen, and expand the movement to defend peace.

We come from different countries and speak different languages. Although we hold various political views and religious beliefs, we represent the common will of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions to strive for peace. We deeply know that the people demand peace and hate war; the people oppose aggression and will never aggress against others; the people demand trade and oppose embargoes and blockades; the people are willing to understand each other and be friendly to each other and are unwilling to be obstructed and isolated; the people need a life of abundance and hate atomic bombs, germ bombs, and chemical weapons.

However, today, the good wishes of the 1.6 billion people of all countries in our Asian and Pacific Regions are being threatened by the shadows of war and preparation for war.

All peace-loving people have long urgently demanded a ceasefire in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis in order to end the tragic disaster suffered by the Korean people and to pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the Far East issue. Now this ceasefire is being delayed. At the same time, the use of extremely cruel weapons of indiscriminate massacre has made the war even more dangerous of expanding. In addition, in other parts of Asia, such as in Vietnam and Malaya, existing military conflicts are also causing significant losses to people's lives and property and endangering the peace of other regions.

The imposition of a separate peace treaty and military agreement with Japan violates existing international agreements and the desire of the Japanese people to achieve complete independence and a peaceful life through a genuine peace treaty with Japan. This brings new suffering to the Japanese people. During World War II, aggressive Japanese militarism caused great disasters to the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions. Now these people feel the threat of the revival of Japanese militarism. With foreign troops stationed on Japanese territory, the Japanese people also face the danger of being dragged into a new war.

Throughout the Asian and Pacific Regions, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of many countries are endangered by aggressive agreements. These agreements burden the people with the heavy burden of armaments, station foreign troops in their countries, and deprive the people of the resources they need for their own welfare and economic development. Widespread war preparations and existing military conflicts in Vietnam, Malaya, and other places have led to increasing suppression of national liberation movements and movements to defend national independence, which, because they aim to end national oppression and national enslavement, make a great contribution to creating a basis for the peaceful coexistence of countries. Under the guise of strategy, free economic and cultural exchanges between countries are increasingly obstructed, and such exchanges are essential for the prosperity of the people and mutual understanding between peoples.

Unified action by the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions for peace can change this situation, end all existing and latent conflicts in Asia, and defeat the threat of war. If they can transform their common will for peace into a united force for defending peace, they can win the conditions for peace to ensure complete national independence, end the disasters they are now suffering from the arms race; ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different political and economic systems on the basis of equality among all nations and the right of all nations to manage their own affairs without foreign interference; enable the principles and spirit of the United Nations Charter, which call for peaceful settlement of international disputes and the reaching of agreements among major powers, to be realized; and stop the wasteful arms race through international disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, germ weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction; destroy all obstacles hindering world trade and cultural exchanges among peoples.

Peace cannot be waited for; peace requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it.

Combined with the peace-loving people in other parts of the world who have the same aspirations, the people of the Asian and Pacific Regions can make peace triumph over war.

To achieve this great goal, we call on all peace-loving individuals and organizations in all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, national differences, and professional categories, to unite more widely under the promotion of the preparatory committees that have been and will be formed in various countries, to launch discussions on the above issues, and to elect representatives to hold the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing in the near future to consult and seek effective solutions to consolidate peace and security in the region.

We ask the peace-loving people and organizations of all countries outside the Asian and Pacific Regions to give us warm support and valuable opinions.

The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions have demonstrated great solidarity in enthusiastically responding to the initiation and preparation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. This force is clearly continuing to grow and expand. The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific Regions have recognized their own strength and therefore have firm confidence in the victory of the movement to defend peace.

If peace in the Asian and Pacific Regions can be ensured, it will make a great contribution to world peace.

Let us unite more widely and closely, act more resolutely and consistently, and undertake the noble cause of defending peace more strongly.

Human reason and international justice will surely triumph over the violence and war of aggression.

Beijing, June 6, 1952

### 亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议宣言
    我们，出席这次一九五二年六月三日至六日在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的，来自亚洲、澳洲、南美洲、北美洲二十个国家的四十七位代表，向亚洲及太平洋区域的人民提出一个迫切的呼吁，那就是，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民团结起来，加强和扩大保卫和平的运动。
    我们来自不同的国家，说着不同的语言。我们虽然抱着各种不同的政治见解和宗教信仰，然而我们却代表亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取和平的共同意志。我们深切知道人民要求和平而厌恨战争；人民反对侵略亦决不侵略别人；人民要求贸易来往而反对禁运和封锁；人民愿意互相了解、互相友好而不愿意遭受阻碍和隔绝；人民需要丰衣足食的生活而痛恨原子弹、细菌弹和化学武器。
    然而在今天，我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国十六亿人民的善良愿望，却正在遭受着战争和备战的魔影的威胁。
    一切爱好和平的人民长久以来就迫切地要求在公平合理的基础上在朝鲜停战，以便结束朝鲜人民所遭受到的惨重灾难，并为和平解决远东问题开辟道路。现在这个停战正在被延迟中。与此同时，极残酷的滥施屠杀的武器之被使用，使战争反而有扩大的危险。此外，在亚洲其他地方，譬如在越南和马来亚，现有的军事冲突也正在使人民的生命财产受到重大损失，并危害及其他地域的和平。
    在日本强施单独对日和约及军事协定，违反了现有国际协定，违反了日本人民想通过真正对日和约来获得完全独立及和平生活的愿望。这样就给日本人民带来新的苦难。在第二次世界大战中，侵略性的日本军国主义，曾使亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民遭受重大灾害。现在这些人民又感受到日本军国主义复活的威胁。由于有外国军队驻在日本领土，日本人民也有被卷入新战争中的危险。
    在整个亚洲及太平洋区域，许多国家的主权与领土完整受到侵略性的协定的危害。这些协定使人民背负了军备的重担，使他们的国境内驻扎着外国军队，并剥夺了人民所需要用于自己福利及经济发展的资源。广泛的备战和越南、马来亚等地现有的军事冲突使民族解放运动和保卫民族独立运动受到日甚一日的镇压，而这种运动，由于其旨在结束民族压迫和民族奴役，对于为各国和平共存创造基础，是有极大贡献的。在战略的藉口下，国家相互间自由的经济和文化交流，日益受到阻挠，而这种交流对于人民的兴旺与人民间的相互了解是非常必要的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为了和平而采取一致行动，就能够改变这种情势，就能够结束亚洲一切现存的和潜伏的冲突，并打退战争的威胁。如果他们能够把要求和平的共同意志，变成保卫和平的团结一致的力量，就能够赢得和平的条件，以保证完全的民族独立，终止他们现在所正遭受着的由扩军备战所带来的灾难；就能够在各民族平等及各民族有权处理自己的事务而不受外来干涉的基础上，保证不同政治经济制度的国家和平共存；就能够使要求和平解决国际分歧和达成大国协议的联合国宪章的原则与精神得以实现；就能够通过国际裁军和禁止原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器及其他大规模屠杀的武器等方法，来停止浪费财富的扩军竞赛；就能够摧毁一切阻挠世界贸易及人民间文化交流的障碍。
    和平不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。
    与世界其他地区抱有同样愿望的爱好和平的人民结合在一起，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民是能够使和平战胜战争的。
    为了达到这个伟大的目的，我们号召亚洲及太平洋区域各国的所有爱好和平的人士和社团，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，都在各国业已组成和行将组成的筹备委员会的推动之下，更广泛地团结起来，展开关于上述这些问题的讨论，并选出代表来，以便在短期内在北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，来协商并求得巩固本区域的和平与安全的有效方案。
    我们要求亚洲及太平洋区域以外的各国爱好和平的人民和社团，给予我们以热烈的支持和宝贵的意见。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人民业已在热烈响应亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起和筹备上，表现出了伟大的团结力量。这力量显然还在继续增长和扩大中。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民已经认识到了自己的这个力量，因而对保卫和平运动的胜利怀有坚定的信心。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的和平如能确保，那对于世界和平就会有莫大的贡献。
    让我们更广泛地紧密团结，更坚决地一致行动，更坚强地把保卫和平的崇高事业担当起来。
    人类理性和国际正义必定会战胜侵略的暴力和战争。
                            一九五二年六月六日——北京
