Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 4th. The Hao Jianxiu Group, in the first month (May) after challenging fine yarn workers nationwide, exceeded all challenge conditions except for the reduction of waste cotton. They increased national cotton yarn production by 41.995 pieces, exceeding the original production plan by 5.47 percent. The group's May achievements were: an average of 0.528 pounds of 23-count yarn produced per spindle in ten hours, a reduction in leather roller licker-in waste to 0.276 percent, defective yarn rate of only 0.027 percent, a reduction in doffing time to 24.2 seconds per cycle, an attendance rate of 96.4 percent, and an average score of 97.8 for the Hao Jianxiu work method assessment for the entire group. All of these exceeded their challenge conditions. Only the total waste cotton produced averaged 14.3 taels per day, which did not meet the original condition (originally set at no more than 13 taels per day).

In May, the Hao Jianxiu Group systematically and centrally resolved the main problems existing in the group's production. For example, in April, their defective yarn rate was about 0.1 percent, and the leather roller licker-in waste rate was 0.338 percent, both of which were far from the challenge conditions. After the competition began, they re-examined the cooperation between the doffers and the machine operators. They changed the method of the doffer first dumping the yarn box after doffing and then returning to help the machine operator piece the broken ends to immediately focusing on helping the machine operator piece the broken ends after doffing, and then dumping the yarn box. This way, the doffer ran less, and caught the time when there were the most broken ends to help with piecing; at the same time, they also flexibly handled the rubbing board movements, which greatly reduced the leather roller licker-in waste and reduced the production of feathery yarn. In reducing defective yarn, Wang Shumei, the union group leader, urged everyone not to drag the yarn too long when doffing, not to wrap the yarn around the yarn package twice before starting a new end, and to start a new end according to the standard. At the same time, in order to avoid the production of "hairy end yarn" and "hairy foot yarn," they regularly paid attention to the cleaning of the lifting rod, which significantly reduced defective yarn. They also made efforts to reduce waste cotton. Although this item has not yet reached the challenge condition of 13 taels, the results are still very significant, considering that the most waste cotton produced in one day at the beginning of the month was 21 taels, while in the second half of the month it gradually decreased to 10 taels, and the least amount produced in one day was only 6 taels.

When solving the above production problems, the group implemented the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and corrected the conservative thinking of individual workers. They studied the day's work every day when they went to work, so that everyone had a clear idea of what to do and had new goals to strive for every day.

    郝建秀小组五月份基本上完成挑战条件
    增产棉纱四十一点九九五件，超过计划百分之五点四七
    【新华社青岛四日电】郝建秀小组在向全国细纱工人挑战后的第一个月（五月份），除减少回丝一项外，都已超额完成了挑战条件，共为国家增产棉纱四十一点九九五件，超过原订的增产计划百分之五点四七。她们小组五月份的成绩是：二十三支纱平均十小时每锭产量达零点五二八磅，皮辊花率降至百分之零点二七六，坏纱只达万分之二点七，落纱时间减为每次二十四点二秒，出勤率达到百分之九六点四，郝建秀工作法测定分数全组平均是九七点八分，都超额完成了她们的挑战条件；只有回丝总量平均每日出到十四点三啢，尚未达到原订条件（原订每日不超过十三啢）。
    郝建秀小组在五月份曾有步骤地、集中地解决了小组在生产上存在的主要问题。如四月份她们的坏纱率约达万分之十，皮辊花率达百分之零点三三八，这些都距离挑战条件较远，竞赛展开后，她们重新研究了落纱工和看车工合作的办法，把过去落纱工落完纱后先将纱盒倒了然后回来帮助看车工接头的办法，改为落完纱后马上集中精力帮助看车工去接头，然后再去倒纱盒，这样落纱工少跑了路，又抓住断头最多的时间去帮助接头；同时她们又机动地处理了打擦板动作，这些都使皮辊花大大降低，羽毛纱也少出了。在减少坏纱方面，由工会小组长王淑美督促大家落纱时拖线不要太长，不要绕纱两圈再去生头，要按照标准生头；同时为了避免“毛头纱”“毛脚纱”的产生，并经常注意升降杆的清洁工作，这样就使坏纱显著减少。她们在减少回丝上也做了一番努力，虽然这一项尚未达到十三啢的挑战条件，可是从月初时回丝最多一天曾达二十一啢，而在下半月后逐步降至十啢，最少的一天只出六啢来看，成绩依然是很显著的。
    小组在解决以上生产问题时，贯彻了批评与自我批评精神，纠正了个别工人的保守思想。每日上班时她们研究一下当天工作，使大家心中有数，每天都有新的奋斗的目标。
