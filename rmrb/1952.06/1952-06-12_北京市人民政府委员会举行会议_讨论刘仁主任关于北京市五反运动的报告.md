    Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee Holds Meeting
    Discusses Director Liu Ren's Report on the "Five-Anti" Campaign in Beijing
    [By Our Own Correspondent] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its 14th meeting of the Second Session on the afternoon of the 6th to hear and discuss the report by Liu Ren, Director of the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Inspection of Economy, on the handling of the "Five-Anti" campaign in Beijing.
    Director Liu Ren first explained that Beijing's "Five-Anti" campaign, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and relying on the broad masses of the people, especially the persistent struggle of workers and shop assistants, has achieved great victory. Director Liu Ren made a concise explanation of the handling of illegal industrial and commercial households. He said: We have handled illegal industrial and commercial households based on Chairman Mao's instructions: "leniency in the past, strictness in the future; leniency towards the majority, strictness towards the minority; leniency for those who confess, strictness for those who resist; leniency towards industry, strictness towards commerce; leniency towards ordinary commerce, strictness towards speculative commerce" and "strictness in struggle, leniency in handling." The standard for handling cases is not only based on the amount of illegal income, but also on the circumstances of the illegal activities and the performance in the past and during the "Five-Anti" campaign. Some people who confessed thoroughly or made meritorious contributions by reporting others were given a reduction of one or two levels of punishment; some people who had done a lot of work for the country and the people in the past were also given a lighter or reduced punishment of one or two levels.
    Regarding the illegal income of industrial and commercial households, because some of the figures reported by the industrial and commercial households were higher and some were lower, it was necessary to verify and correct them during the handling process. In order to take care of the production and business of private industrial and commercial households, the time for refunding illegal income could be postponed until after September and October, and the refunds could be made in installments.
    The temporary difficulties existing in private industry and commerce have improved through government support and the efforts of both labor and management. However, it is still necessary to overcome the passive waiting or simple reliance on state support by some private industrial and commercial households, and they should take the initiative to improve management and open up sales channels. At the same time, labor and management should negotiate well and do a good job in production and business. In his report, Director Liu Ren especially pointed out that the government has done a lot of work to help the recovery and development of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, mainly through processing, ordering, purchasing finished products, and providing loans. Up to now, more than 7,200 industrial and commercial households have received support.
    Municipal People's Government Committee members Le Songsheng, Zheng Yun, Li Guorui, Xu Chubo, Wang Feiran, Lei Jieqiong, and Shu Sheyu successively spoke, unanimously agreeing that the principle of "strictness in struggle, leniency in handling" adopted in the "Five-Anti" campaign was very correct. Le Songsheng, Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles: The People's Government's handling of industrial and commercial households is very reasonable, especially the recent detailed accounting for industrial and commercial households, verifying the overstated or understated illegal amounts of industrial and commercial households during the campaign, which convinced the illegal industrial and commercial households. Everyone is very impressed with Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership. Now the government allows illegal industrial and commercial households to pay the refundable, payable, and fined amounts in installments and deferred payments, which is extremely benevolent and righteous. On behalf of the industrial and commercial circles, I pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Mayor Peng. In the future, we have greater confidence and are determined to take the initiative to do a good job in production and business.
    In the speeches of the Municipal People's Government Committee members, some talked about the many new atmospheres that have emerged in the market after the "Five-Anti" campaign; some expressed their opinions on some of the current problems in labor-management relations.
    Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen made a concluding speech. He said: Handling illegal industrial and commercial households based on the principle of "strictness in struggle, leniency in handling" is beneficial to the country, the people, and economic construction. Our handling of industrial and commercial households has been lenient again and again. The purpose of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns is mainly to give everyone a profound education, eliminate the dirt and poison left over from the old society, and transform society. Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen also gave important instructions on some of the current problems in labor-management relations.
    At the end of the meeting, the partial adjustment of the institutions under the Municipal People's Government and a list of personnel appointments and removals were retroactively approved and submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval by the Municipal People's Government.

    北京市人民政府委员会举行会议
    讨论刘仁主任关于北京市五反运动的报告
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府委员会在六日下午举行第二届第十四次会议，听取并讨论北京市节约检查委员会主任刘仁关于北京市“五反”运动处理情况的报告。
    刘仁主任首先说明：北京市的“五反”运动，在中央人民政府领导下，依靠广大人民，特别是工人店员的坚持斗争，已经取得了极大胜利。对违法工商户的处理情况，刘仁主任作了扼要的说明。他说：我们对违法工商户，是根据毛主席指示的“过去从宽，今后从严；多数从宽，少数从严；坦白从宽，抗拒从严；工业从宽，商业从严；普通商业从宽，投机商业从严”以及“斗争从严，处理从宽”的原则来进行处理的。处理的标准不仅是根据违法所得的数目，而且还根据违法的情节和过去及在“五反”运动中的表现。有些人坦白彻底或有检举立功表现，就减一级或两级处理；还有一些人过去为国家、人民做了不少工作，对这些人也给以从轻或减轻一级或两级处理。
    对工商户的违法所得，因为工商户的自报数字，有的说得多一些，有的却说少了，在处理时就必须经过核实改正。为了照顾私营工商业户的生产和营业，在退补违法所得方面，交款时间可以推迟到九、十月以后，并且分期退款。
    对于私营工商业暂时存在的困难，经过政府的扶植，和劳资双方的努力，现在已经好转，但仍须克服一部分私营工商业户消极等待或单纯依靠国家扶植的思想，而应该主动努力，改善经营，打开销路。同时，劳资双方应当好好协商，搞好生产与营业。刘仁主任在报告中特别指出：政府为了帮助有利国计民生的工商业的恢复与发展，已做了很多工作，主要是加工、定货、收购成品和贷款。到现在为止，受到扶植的工商户已达七千二百多户。
    市人民政府委员乐松生、郑芸、李国瑞、徐楚波、王斐然、雷洁琼和舒舍予相继发言，对“五反”运动中所采取的“斗争从严，处理从宽”的原则，一致认为十分正确。北京市工商业联合会副主任委员乐松生代表工商界说：人民政府对工商户的处理是非常合理的，特别是最近替工商户算细帐，把工商户在运动中多说或少说的违法数目，核对确实，使违法工商户都心服口服。毛主席这样英明的领导，使每个人都非常佩服。现在政府允许违法的工商户分期延期缴纳应退、应补、应罚的款项，更是仁至义尽。我代表工商界向毛主席、彭市长致敬。今后，我们有更大的信心，并且决心主动地搞好生产和营业。
    在市人民政府委员的发言中，有的谈到“五反”运动后，市面上出现的许多新气象；有的就目前劳资关系中的一些问题，发表了意见。
    最后由彭真市长作总结发言。他说：处理违法工商户，本着“斗争从严，处理从宽”的原则，是对国家、对人民、对经济建设都有利的。我们对工商户的处理，已经一再从宽。“三反”“五反”运动的目的，主要是使大家受到深刻的教育，肃清旧社会遗留的污毒、改造社会。最后彭真市长并对目前劳资关系中的一些问题，作了重要的指示。
    会议最后追认通过市人民政府所属机构的部分调整和一批人事任免名单，并由市人民政府报请政务院批准。
