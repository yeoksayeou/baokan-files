    Sino-Soviet Children's Friendship Song
    Editor's Note: When the Soviet composer Kabalevsky visited China in 1951, he invited Yuan Shuipai to write a poem for a song about the friendship between Chinese and Soviet children, so that he could compose the music. He felt that it would be particularly interesting for a song like this to be a collaboration between two artists, one from China and one from the Soviet Union. After Kabalevsky took the original poem back to the Soviet Union, he asked the poet Marshak to translate it into Russian, and then composed the music. The melody is very beautiful and pleasant, blending the flavors of Chinese and Soviet folk music. It should be noted that when matching the Chinese lyrics, the wording was changed, so Marshak's name was not signed. This song will be taught on the Central People's Broadcasting Station's children's program at 6:30 p.m. on June 11th and 12th.

### 中苏儿童友谊之歌（歌曲）

    中苏儿童友谊之歌 
    编者按：苏联作曲家卡巴列夫斯基于一九五一年访问中国时，约请袁水拍作一首歌唱中苏儿童友谊的诗，以便作曲。他觉得这样一首歌曲由中国和苏联的两个艺术工作者来合作，是特别有意思的。卡巴列夫斯基把原诗带回苏联之后，请诗人马尔夏克编译为俄文，然后作了曲。这支曲调十分优美悦耳，混和着中苏两国的民族音乐的风味。要说明的是，在配中文歌词的时候，字句有了变动，因此没有署上马尔夏克的名字。这个歌在六月十一日和十二日下午六时半在中央人民广播电台少年儿童节目教唱。
