In order to respond to this call, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby notifies the following:

    I. Trade union organizations in various regions may, based on the specific circumstances of each region and under the principles of not hindering production and the voluntary participation of employees, hold small-scale mass commemorative meetings on June 25th, taking factories, mines, and large stores as units (small factories and stores may be appropriately combined). At the meetings, letters of respect and greetings to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers may be adopted.

    II. Please have responsible comrades from the local area deliver reports on the current situation of the world peace movement and the Korean battlefield, as well as on how to strive to increase production and practice thrift, strengthen economic construction, consolidate national defense, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and defend world peace.

    In carrying out this work, contact and cooperate with relevant organizations such as the Communist Youth League and the Democratic Women's Federation, and report to us on the situation of the commemorative meeting, the number of attendees, and the experiences gained.

                                      All-China Federation of Trade Unions, June 19, 1952
