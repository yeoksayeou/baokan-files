Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 25th: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held an enlarged meeting of all members from May 13th to 20th. At the meeting, Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau, delivered a report on "Basic Summary of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' Movements in the Northeast Region." Based on this report, the meeting focused on discussing the consolidation of the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the strengthening of economic construction, and made relevant resolutions and instructions.

    In his summary report, Comrade Gao Gang elaborated on the great significance and gains of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, analyzed the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast and the shortcomings existing within the Party, and put forward the tasks of strengthening economic work and strengthening Party building.

    Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that the significance of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles lies in further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidating the leadership of the working class, and consolidating the people's democratic united front ideologically, politically, and economically. Its most fundamental significance lies in removing obstacles and preparing conditions for our country to carry out large-scale economic construction, thereby ensuring the continued development of the New Democratic revolution and clearing the way for a victorious transition to socialism in the future.

    Regarding the gains of this movement, he said: The "Five-Anti" movement effectively打击 (dǎ jī - cracked down on) and curbed the "five poisons" activities of illegal bourgeois elements, ensuring the implementation of the Common Program. This makes it easier for the Party and the government to better lead and unite the bourgeoisie and develop our country's economic undertakings. The "Three-Anti" movement effectively打击 (dǎ jī - cracked down on) and curbed the illegal and undisciplined behavior of corrupt elements, enhanced the concept of integrity and public service among state personnel, and changed some of the serious extravagance and waste and bureaucratic styles in state organs. This movement prepared extremely favorable conditions for a large-scale production increase and frugality campaign, enriched the content of Party rectification, made the Party more pure and consolidated organizationally and ideologically, further strengthened the Party's ties with the masses, and greatly strengthened the Party's combat effectiveness. At the same time, this movement was also a large-scale ideological transformation and social reform movement. Through this movement, not only did Party members, cadres, and the broad masses of workers draw a clear ideological line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but also established a new atmosphere of thrift and frugality among the people and raised the patriotic enthusiasm and awareness of being masters of the country among the broad masses. The illegal activities of illegal bourgeois elements, corrupt elements, and extravagant waste and bureaucratic styles will be subject to greater supervision by the broad masses. The contamination left over from thousands of years of reactionary rule will be cleansed as a result. It can be seen that the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements is another great victory following the three major victories of land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the resistance against US aggression and aid to Korea.

    Regarding the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast region, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out: The proportion of the state-owned economy in the Northeast is extremely large, and its development is extremely rapid. Private capitalist economy is highly dependent on the state-owned economy. After liberation, with the development of the state-owned economy, private industry and commerce in the Northeast also developed greatly. Taking Shenyang City as an example: the number of private industrial enterprises was only 6,546 at the end of 1948, increased to 11,752 in 1949, increased to 15,727 in 1950, and increased to 18,421 in 1951; the number of employees in private industrial enterprises: 26,008 in 1948, increased to 47,506 in 1949, increased to 66,228 in 1950, and increased to 80,568 in 1951, more than doubled in three years. The number of private commercial establishments was only 11,034 in 1948, increased to 17,149 in 1949, increased to 18,143 in 1950, and 15,605 in 1951; the total sales value: 762,700,234 yuan in 1949, 1,235,000,755 yuan in 1950, and 1,826,700,4504 yuan in 1951, also nearly doubled in two years. However, illegal bourgeois elements were not only unwilling to accept the leadership of the state, but instead carried out the "five poisons" everywhere, and took advantage of their close relationship with the state-owned economy to steal state property by all means. Based on the materials exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, Comrade Gao Gang analyzed the specific manifestations of the theft and speculation of illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast region. He said: All illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast, in addition to universally evading taxes, almost all relied on stealing state property to develop (such as some completely illegal households in iron shops, construction companies, timber, hardware, and electrical materials sales). They once colluded with corrupt and degenerate elements within state organs, stealing or illegally reselling in large quantities materials produced by state-owned enterprises and controlled by the state, and then selling them back to the state at high prices; they massively adulterated goods and cheated on workmanship and materials in processing and procurement entrusted by the state, fraudulently obtaining illegal profits. Therefore, some industries in private industry and commerce were able to jump to become "nouveau riche." Their extreme speculation is manifested in: they do not rely on improving management methods to obtain legitimate profits, but rely on speculation and profiteering to obtain illegal profits; the illegal profits they seized are not invested in industrial construction or expanded production and legitimate operations, but are used to purchase and hoard gold, or dispersed and transferred, or invested in speculative commercial markets; they have little interest in operating industries and a great interest in engaging in commercial speculation, and many industrial funds have been diverted to speculative commerce. In operating industries, they do not pay attention to improving product quality and maintaining product reputation, but aim at "making a quick buck"; many owners in commerce do not engage in fixed industries at all, but drill into whatever is profitable. In order to cover up this illegal activity, they also manifest as: frequently changing the names of factories or stores; narrow storefronts and fat dark warehouses; one set on the surface and another in secret; to the point that they are nominally industrial but actually commercial, nominally shopkeepers but actually peddlers, and so on. From the above situation, it is clear that among the illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast region, "five poisons" behavior is most serious among the big speculators. Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that the theft and speculation activities of the illegal bourgeois elements in the Northeast region are mainly directed at state economic organs and state-owned enterprises, thus directly harming the country's economic construction. But they also launched extensive attacks on the urban and rural people, damaging the people's economic life. In addition to economic attacks, they also adopted methods of ideological erosion and organizational infiltration to attack the Communist Party, the working class, and state organ personnel, attempting to weaken or even usurp the leadership of the working class.

    Based on the materials exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, Comrade Gao Gang analyzed the shortcomings existing within the Party. He pointed out: Over the past three years, the Party organizations in the Northeast region, together with all the people of the Northeast, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, have correctly implemented the Party Central Committee's line and policies, continued to maintain the glorious tradition of hard struggle, actively supported the resistance against US aggression and aid to Korea, developed economic construction, and initially improved the people's lives, and have continuously conducted sharp criticism and struggle against the right-leaning thoughts and corruption of some cadres within the Party; therefore, the revolutionary and construction undertakings in the Northeast region have achieved great achievements. However, after the national revolutionary victory, the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie also eroded the ideology of some Party organizations and many Party members to a certain extent, and harmed the construction undertakings of the Party and the state to a certain extent. This shortcoming is specifically manifested in: (1) There are some serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the state power organs and various work departments led by the Party. (2) Some Party organizations in cities have extremely weak or even weak leadership over the bourgeoisie, extremely weak contact with and education of the working masses in private enterprises, so that the "five poisons" of illegal bourgeois elements took the opportunity to spread, but they could not rely on the broad masses of workers to expose and stop them in time. Among the Party members and cadres in rural areas, some capitalist tendencies have grown, such as some Party members hiring long-term workers and participating in usury and rural commercial speculation. (3) Serious departmentalism exists in some organs and cadres, resulting in behaviors such as "transforming public ownership into small collective ownership" and "transforming public ownership into private ownership." In engaging in organ production, some cadres have degenerated and corrupted, undermining the state's financial discipline and harming the state's economic construction. (4) A small number of class aliens and degenerate elements who have infiltrated the Party, under the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, echoed them from within and without, and became thieves who devoured a large amount of state wealth.

    Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that the reason why the above-mentioned situations occurred in the Party and the state power, economic organs, and enterprises led by the Party, and the reasons for the failure to stop them in time, are objectively due to: the peaceful construction environment after the national victory, the wide and complex contact between cadres and the bourgeoisie, the retention of a large number of old personnel and bourgeois intellectuals in state organs, etc.; but the most fundamental reasons are: (1) Many Party members and cadres lack a clear understanding of the new changes in domestic class relations after the national revolutionary victory, lack sufficient vigilance against the ideological erosion and illegal attacks of the bourgeoisie, and therefore cannot correctly grasp the new laws of uniting and struggling with the bourgeoisie under the new conditions. (2) Many Party organizations lack strong political and ideological leadership, and have developed vulgar liberalist thoughts and styles. (3) Many leading organs have developed serious bureaucratic and formalistic styles that are divorced from reality and the masses, lack in-depth study of the Party's instructions, especially failing to pay attention to checking work, so that the Party's resolutions cannot be well implemented. (4) The number of non-working class components, especially petty-bourgeois components, in the Party is very large, and theoretical education and political education have not been done well enough. All these are the root causes of various right-leaning thoughts in the Party, and these right-leaning thoughts have opened the door for illegal bourgeois elements to launch rampant attacks.

    Comrade Gao Gang emphasized that the decisive link in consolidating and developing the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements lies in doing a good job in economic construction. He said: Due to the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the major corrupt elements and economic internal traitors within state-owned enterprises and organs have been eliminated, various loopholes have been plugged, state financial discipline has been further strengthened, and the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees have been improved. In addition, the government has recently increased wages and lowered prices. These factors have prepared extremely favorable conditions for carrying out a large-scale production increase and frugality campaign. Therefore, the current focus of the Party's leadership should quickly and resolutely shift to economic work; if we still do not pay attention to strengthening economic work now, delay the opportunity, it will cause irreparable losses to the country and we will commit serious mistakes.

    Comrade Gao Gang briefly pointed out the important key issues in strengthening economic work:

    Industry: (1) In order to adapt to the situation where the recovery phase of Northeast industry is nearing completion and large-scale economic construction with key points has begun, the Party's leadership over state-owned industry should put basic construction work in the primary position. This requires the Party's leading cadres, especially industrial leading cadres, to reach a complete consensus on the guidelines and policies for developing industry; and on the basis of consistent understanding, make the greatest efforts to strengthen the leadership of basic construction, strengthen the forces of basic construction, strengthen the Party's work and mass work in basic construction departments, and mobilize all employees to ensure the completion of this year's basic construction plan. At the same time, we must accelerate the exploration of resources and the cultivation of industrial reserve forces, and start drafting a long-term plan for developing industry to meet the nationwide upsurge of large-scale economic construction. (2) Carry out the production increase and frugality campaign in industrial production, and require the realization of the task of increasing production and saving eight million tons of grain value beyond the plan this year. To this end, the focus of the Party's leadership should be on fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of workers and technicians, carrying out labor competitions, promoting advanced experiences and advanced production methods, and opposing conservative ideas as the main content of work. (3) Develop local industry: Due to the takeover of a large number of organ production enterprises and the new situation in market supply, and in order to adapt to the development of the Northeast national economy and the division of labor between state-owned industry and local industry, it is necessary to determine the direction and construction plan for the development of local industry based on the characteristics of each region; currently, local industry should solve the problems in the supply of raw materials and the sales of products, strive to learn from the experience of state-owned factories and mines, earnestly improve the management of local industry, and strengthen the economic accounting system.

    Agriculture: Due to industrial development, a large amount of grain and industrial raw materials are needed. Therefore, the agricultural sector and rural Party organizations must seize the patriotic production increase movement and strive to harvest 20 million tons of grain this year and complete the planned output of other industrial crops; and strive to double the total value of Northeast agricultural production five years later than 1952, so that agricultural production meets the requirements of industrial development. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Increase the unit yield of existing cultivated land: build water conservancy projects, apply more fertilizer, improve seeds, prevent and control pests and diseases, breed horses, promote new agricultural tools, and promote agricultural cooperativization in a guided, planned, and steady manner. The requirements are: five years later, agricultural production cooperatives will dominate the rural economy, and new agricultural tools and some tractors will be widely used in agricultural production cooperatives, changing the past farming methods. (2) Expand the area of cultivated land: in addition to investing a part of the labor force saved by promoting cooperativization and using new agricultural tools in this work, it should also be planned, organized, and prepared to migrate from Southern Manchuria and within the Guan (关) to Northern Manchuria for reclamation, build new villages, and establish state-owned farms and collective farms. Therefore, it is necessary to train a large number of agricultural technicians, start soil surveying, area measurement, house repair and other preparatory work, quickly determine the five-year immigration plan and national investment plan, and ensure its completion year by year.

    Trade: Due to the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the increasing purchasing power of the people, the increase in the supply and marketing business of state-owned commerce after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the development of international trade, it is necessary to strengthen the work of state-owned commerce and cooperatives. The Party organizations in the commercial sector should ensure the completion of this year's national trade plan and achieve the task of increasing production and saving a value equivalent to 2.4 million tons of grain; it is necessary to strengthen the supply and marketing of industrial equipment and building materials; strengthen warehouse management; expand the retail network, so that this year's retail sales of state-owned commerce and cooperatives in the region will account for more than 60% of the total social retail sales in the region (only 16% in 1949). To this end, it is necessary to quickly transfer cadres to strengthen the state-owned commercial sector, and promote new activists from the state-owned commercial sector, clean up economic internal traitors and corrupt and degenerate elements; it is necessary to strengthen the management of private commerce, implement the policy towards private commerce, study and formulate necessary management systems to plug all loopholes; it is necessary to establish a political work system in the state-owned commercial sector, and local Party committees should regularly check the work of state-owned commerce.

    Private Industry and Commerce: In order to strengthen economic construction, it is necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of private capital after the "Five-Anti" movement and prevent it from carrying out the "five poisons" again. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Correctly handle the conclusion of the "Five-Anti" work, and re-verify the amount of refunds and tax supplements for private industry and commerce in a pragmatic spirit. The repayment time should also be allowed to be extended or paid in installments according to the actual situation. In the verification, more care should be given to industrial households that are conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in order to encourage capitalists to actively operate industries and expand production. (2) Restore all processing orders that can be restored, and actively purchase products from private industry; for those who have real difficulties in production, the government may also grant necessary credit loans to maintain production at its discretion. (3) Actively organize the transfer, resettlement, and relief of unemployed workers in private enterprises after the "Five-Anti" movement. Although the number of unemployed workers in the Northeast region is very small, it should be ensured that no worker is unemployed. (4) Based on the experience of the "Five-Anti" movement, strengthen the government's management of private industry and commerce to prevent it from carrying out the "five poisons" again. It is necessary to gradually organize the strength of private industry under the state's planned economy; at the same time, it is necessary to rectify and strengthen the Party work and trade union work in private enterprises.

    Regarding strengthening Party building, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen ideological education and organizational work on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to consolidate the achievements of this movement. To this end, it is necessary to: (1) Launch ideological inspection and ideological criticism to further draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie. Leading cadres who have not yet made a review to the masses in the movement must conduct democratic make-up lessons. The Party's leading departments at all levels must constantly prevent the erosion of bourgeois ideology in all aspects in the future, and regard the struggle against all bourgeois ideological styles that have invaded the Party as a long-term and major political task. To this end, it is necessary to organize cadres and Party members to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in a planned way to improve their theoretical and ideological level. (2) Correctly handle corrupt elements, clean up bad elements from the Party, explain the relationship between cadres and the bourgeoisie, review cadres, and complete the reorganization. (3) Promote and cultivate cadres in large numbers: On the one hand, it is necessary to promote a large number of activists who emerged in the movement to meet the urgent needs of current work; on the other hand, in order to meet the needs of large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of new technical cadres, run specialized schools and various technical schools well, and organize spare-time technical learning. The Party organizations at all levels should guarantee the completion of this task. (4) Actively develop new Party members, and absorb outstanding activists into the Party in a planned and step-by-step manner among the working masses, in organs, enterprises, and schools, and in mutual aid groups, production cooperatives, state-owned farms, and collective farms in rural areas. (5) Improve the leadership style, promptly contact business, grasp the key, check work, discover problems and solve problems, and summarize advanced experiences to improve policy level and business level and promote work progress; oppose the "post-mortem" type of, formulaic, formalistic summary, and thoroughly change the bureaucratic style.

    The meeting unanimously agreed with Comrade Gao Gang's report. In the group and general discussions, everyone's speeches were filled with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. It was unanimously believed that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements called for and led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee were great revolutionary movements with historical significance, which were completely timely and completely correct, and the leadership of the Party Central Committee was extremely wise. The Party organizations in the Northeast region implemented the Party Central Committee's line and policies, achieved the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, improved the ideological level and political awareness of the entire Party, consolidated and purified the Party organization, and greatly strengthened the Party's combat effectiveness. Therefore, everyone has more confidence in completing various work tasks in the future. After the meeting, the resolution of the conference was immediately put into action. The Northeast Bureau mobilized some leading cadres according to the situation after the "Three-Anti" movement; at the same time, the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Military Region organized a group of cadres to conduct strict inspections of the work of various departments to ensure the effective implementation of the spirit of the conference.

    中共中央东北局举行扩大会议
    高岗同志总结全区“三反”“五反”运动
    并提出加强经济工作和党的建设的任务
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】中共中央东北局在五月十三日到二十日举行全体委员扩大会议，会上东北局书记高岗作了“关于东北地区‘三反’‘五反’运动的基本总结”的报告。会议根据这个报告，着重地讨论了巩固“三反”“五反”运动的成果和加强经济建设工作等问题，并作出了有关的决议和指示。
    高岗同志在总结报告中，阐述了“三反”“五反”运动的伟大意义和收获，分析了东北不法资产阶级分子猖狂进攻的情况和党内所存在的缺点，并提出了加强经济工作和加强党的建设的任务。
    高岗同志指出：“三反”和“五反”斗争的意义，在于从思想上、政治上和经济上进一步巩固人民民主专政，巩固工人阶级的领导权，巩固人民民主统一战线；其最根本的意义，则在于为我们国家进行大规模的经济建设清除障碍和准备条件，从而保证新民主主义革命事业的继续发展，并为将来胜利地转入社会主义扫清道路。
    关于这一运动的收获，他说：“五反”运动有力地打击了和制止了不法资产阶级分子的“五毒”活动，保证了共同纲领的贯彻。这就便于党和政府更好地领导和团结资产阶级，发展我国的经济事业。“三反”运动有力地打击了和制止了贪污分子的违法乱纪行为，在国家工作人员中增强了廉洁奉公的观念，改变了国家机关中若干严重的铺张浪费现象和官僚主义作风。这一运动为大规模的增产节约运动准备了极有利的条件，丰富了整党的内容，使党在组织上和思想上更加纯洁和巩固了，使党和人民群众的联系进一步加强了，大大地加强了党的战斗力。同时，这一运动也是一个大规模的思想改造和社会改革运动。经过这一运动，不仅使党员、干部和广大工人群众划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，而且在人民群众中树立起新的俭朴、节约的风气，提高了广大人民的爱国主义热情和国家主人翁的自觉。不法资产阶级分子的违法活动、贪污分子以及铺张浪费和官僚主义作风，将由此而更加受到广大人民的监督。数千年来反动统治所遗留下来的污毒，将由此而被清洗。由此可见，“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，是继土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝三大运动胜利后的又一次伟大胜利。
    关于东北地区的不法资产阶级分子猖狂进攻的情形，高岗同志指出：东北国营经济的比重极大，发展极为迅速，私人资本主义经济对国营经济存在着极大的依赖性。解放后，随着国营经济的发展，东北的私营工商业也有很大的发展。以沈阳市为例：私营工业在一九四八年底只有六千五百四十六户，
    一九四九年增加到一万一千七百五十二户，一九五○年增加到一万五千七百二十七户，一九五一年增加到一万八千四百二十一户；私营工业的职工人数：一九四八年为二万六千零八人，一九四九年增加到四万七千五百零六人，一九五○年增加到六万六千二百二十八人，一九五一年增加到八万零五百六十八人，三年内发展两倍多。私营商业在一九四八年只有一万一千零三十四户，一九四九年增加到一万七千一百四十九户，一九五○年增加到一万八千一百四十三户，一九五一年为一万五千六百零五户；销售总值：一九四九年为七亿六千二百七十万二千零三十四元，一九五○年为十二亿三千五百万七千五百五十五元，一九五一年为十八亿二千六百七十万四千五百零四元，两年内也发展了将近两倍。但是，不法资产阶级分子却不但不甘于接受国家的领导，反而到处施行“五毒”，并利用了他们与国营经济的密切关系，用一切办法盗窃国家的财产。高岗同志根据“三反”“五反”运动中所暴露的材料，分析了东北地区的不法资产阶级分子的盗窃性和投机性的具体表现。他说：东北所有的不法资产阶级分子，除了普遍地偷税漏税外，几乎都是依靠盗窃国家财产发展起来的（如铁店、建筑行、木材及五金、电料贩卖业中的若干完全违法户）。他们曾经勾结国家机关内部的贪污蜕化分子，大量地盗窃或违禁倒卖国家企业所生产并为国家所统制的资材，转手又以高价卖给国家；他们在国家所委托的加工和采购中，大量地搀假作弊，偷工减料，
    骗取非法暴利。因此，私营工商业中的某些行业才得以一跃而为“暴发户”。他们极大的投机性表现在：他们不依靠改进经营方法获得正当利润，而是依靠投机倒把牟取非法暴利；他们用非法手段攫取的暴利，不是投资于工业建设或扩大生产和正当经营，而是购囤黄金，或分散转移，或投入投机商业市场；他们经营工业的兴趣少，从事商业投机的兴趣大，有不少的工业资金转向了投机商业。在经营工业中，他们不注意提高产品质量，保持产品信誉，而是以“捞一把”为目的；商业中的许多业主根本不从事于固定的行业，而是什么利大就钻营什么。他们为了掩盖这种违法活动，又表现为：经常改换工厂或商店的名称；门面瘦、暗库肥；表面一套、暗中一套；以至名为工业实为商业、名为座商实为行商等等。从上述情况看，显然地，东北地区的不法资产阶级分子中，“五毒”行为尤以大投机商最为严重。高岗同志指出：东北地区的不法资产阶级分子这种盗窃、投机活动，是以国家经济机关和国营企业为主要进攻对象，因此直接损害了国家的经济建设。但他们同时也向城乡人民进行了广泛的进攻，破坏人民的经济生活。除了经济上的进攻外，他们还采取思想上侵蚀和组织上渗透的方法，向共产党、工人阶级内部和国家机关工作人员进攻，企图以此来削弱以至篡夺工人阶级的领导权。
    高岗同志根据“三反”“五反”中所暴露的材料，分析了党内存在的缺点。他指出：三年来，东北地区党的组织，和全东北人民在一起，在毛主席和党中央的领导下，正确地执行了党中央的路线、政策，继续保持了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，积极支援了抗美援朝斗争，发展了经济建设事业，初步地改善了人民的生活，并曾经不断地对党内若干干部的右倾思想和贪污腐化现象，进行过尖锐的批判和斗争；因此，使东北地区的革命事业和建设事业获得了很大的成就。但是，全国革命胜利后，资产阶级的思想影响，也在一定程度上侵蚀了党的若干组织和不少党员的思想，并在一定程度上危害了党和国家的建设事业。这一缺点具体表现在：（一）在党所领导的国家政权机关和各种工作部门中，存在着若干严重的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象。（二）党在城市的若干组织，对资产阶级的领导极为薄弱甚至软弱无力，与私营企业中工人群众的联系以及对他们的教育工作极为薄弱，以致不法资产阶级分子的
    “五毒”乘机蔓延，却不能依靠广大工人群众及时地加以揭发和制止。在农村的党员和干部中，则滋长着某些资本主义倾向，如有些党员雇了长工，参与了高利贷剥削和农村的商业投机活动。（三）某些机关和干部中存在着严重的本位主义，因而产生了“化大公为小公”、“化公为私”等行为，在从事机关生产中，有一部分干部蜕化堕落，败坏了国家的财政纪律，损害了国家的经济建设事业。
    （四）少数混进党内的阶级异己分子以及蜕化变质分子，在不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻下，更与他们内外呼应，沦为大量吞噬国家财富的盗贼。
    高岗同志指出：在党内和党所领导的国家政权、经济机关和企业中之所以发生上述情况，以及未能及时制止的原因，客观上是由于：全国胜利后的和平建设环境，干部与资产阶级的接触面广而复杂，国家机关中留用了大批的旧人员和资产阶级的知识分子等等；而最根本的原因则在于：（一）许多党员和干部对于全国革命胜利后国内阶级关系的新的变化缺乏清醒的认识，对资产阶级的思想侵蚀及其违法的进攻缺乏足够的警惕，因而不能正确地掌握在新的条件下与资产阶级联合和斗争的新的规律性。（二）不少党的组织中缺乏坚强的政治领导和思想领导，发展了庸俗的自由主义的思想、作风。
    （三）不少的领导机关滋长了严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义和形式主义作风，对党的指示缺乏钻研，尤其是不注意检查工作，使党的决议不能很好地贯彻。（四）党内非工人阶级成份特别是小资产阶级成份的数量很大，而理论教育和政治教育工作又做得不够。所有这些，就是党内各种右倾思想的根源，而这些右倾思想就给不法资产阶级分子开放了猖狂进攻的方便之门。
    高岗同志着重指出：巩固和发展“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，其决定的环节在于搞好经济建设。他说：由于“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，国家企业、机关内部的大贪污分子和经济内奸被扫除，各种漏洞被堵塞，国家财政纪律更加加强，广大职工的政治觉悟和劳动积极性提高，加上最近政府又提高了工资和降低了物价，这些因素，就给开展大规模的增产节约运动准备了极有利的条件。因此，目前党的领导工作重点应当迅速地、坚决地转到经济工作方面来；如果现在还不注意加强经济工作，迁延时机，就会给国家造成不可弥补的损失，就要犯严重的错误。
    高岗同志扼要地指出了加强经济工作的重要关键问题：
    工业方面：（一）为适应东北工业的恢复阶段接近结束和有重点的大规模经济建设已经开始的情况，党对国营工业的领导，应把基本建设工作提到首要的地位。这就必须使党的领导干部首先是工业领导干部，对发展工业的方针、政策取得完全一致的认识；并在认识一致的基础上，以最大的努力加强对基本建设的领导，充实基本建设的力量，加强基本建设部门党的工作和群众工作，动员全体职工保证今年基本建设计划的完成。同时，必须加紧资源的勘察和工业后备力量的培养，着手制订发展工业的长期计划草案，以迎接全国范围的大规模经济建设高潮。（二）在工业生产中开展增产节约运动，要求实现今年超计划增产节约八百万吨粮食的价值的任务。为此，党的领导重点，应以充分发动工人群众和技术人员的积极性、开展劳动竞赛、推广先进经验和先进生产方法、反对保守思想为主要工作内容。（三）发展地方工业：由于大批机关生产企业被接收，以及市场供应发生了新的情况，同时为适应东北国民经济的发展和国营工业与地方工业的分工，必须根据各地的特点，确定地方工业的发展方向和建设计划；目前地方工业应解决原料供应和产品推销中的问题，努力学习国营厂、矿的经验，切实改进地方工业的经营管理，加强经济核算制度。
    农业方面：由于工业发展，需要大量的粮食和工业原料，因此，农业部门和农村党的组织必须抓紧进行爱国丰产运动，争取今年收获两千万吨粮食及完成其他工业作物产量的计划；并争取五年后东北农业生产的总值比一九五二年增加一倍，使农业生产与工业发展的要求相适应。为此，必须：（一）提高现有耕地面积的单位产量：兴修水利，多施肥，改良种籽，防治病虫害，繁殖马匹，推广新式农具，有领导地、有计划地、稳步地推行农业合作化。要求达到：五年后使农业生产合作社在农村经济中居于优势，并在农业生产合作社内普遍使用新式农具以及部分的拖拉机，改变过去的耕作方法。（二）扩大耕地面积：除以推行合作化及使用新式农具所节余的劳动力的一部投入这一工作外，并应有计划地、有组织地、有准备地从南满和关内移民到北满进行垦荒，建立新村，建立国营农场和集体农场。因此，必须大量培养农业技术人员，开始土壤测量、面积测量、房舍修缮等准备工作，迅速确定五年移民计划和国家投资计划，并保证其逐年完成。
    贸易方面：由于工农业生产的迅速发展和人民购买力的日益提高，“三反”、“五反”以后国营商业供销业务的增加，以及国际贸易的发展，必须加强国营商业和合作社的工作。商业部门党的组织应保证完成今年的国家贸易计划，并实现增产节约价值等于二百四十万吨粮食的任务；必须加强工业器材和建筑器材的供销工作；加强仓库管理工作；扩大零售网，使今年国营商业和合作社的区内零售额，达到占全区社会零售额的百分之六十以上（一九四九年仅占百分之十六）。为此，必须迅速抽调干部充实国营商业部门，并从国营商业部门中提拔新的积极分子，清洗经济内奸和贪污蜕化分子；必须加强对私营商业的管理，贯彻对私营商业的政策，研究并制订必要的管理制度，以堵塞一切漏洞；必须在国营商业部门建立政治工作制度，地方党委应经常检查国营商业的工作。
    私营工商业方面：为了加强经济建设，必须在“五反”运动后发挥私人资本的积极性，并防止其再施
    “五毒”。为此，必须：（一）正确地处理“五反”结案工作，以实事求是的精神，重新核实私营工商业退财、补税的款额，退补时间亦应根据实际情况，允许其延期、分期交付。在核实中，对有利于国计民生的工业户，应给以更多的照顾，以鼓励资本家积极经营工业、扩大生产。（二）恢复一切可以恢复的加工订货，积极收购私营工业的产品；对生产中确有困难者，并可由政府酌贷必要的维持生产的信用贷款。（三）积极组织“五反”后私营企业中的失业工人的转业、安置、救济等工作，虽然东北地区的失业工人为数很少，但应做到不使一个工人失业。（四）根据“五反”运动的经验，加强政府对私营工商业的管理工作，防止其再施“五毒”，要在国家的计划经济下，逐步把私营工业的力量组织起来；同时，要整顿和加强私营企业中的党的工作和工会工作。
    关于加强党的建设，高岗同志指出：要在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，加强思想教育和组织工作，以巩固这一运动的成果。为此，必须：（一）展开思想检查和思想批判工作，进一步划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限。领导干部在运动中尚未向群众作过检讨者，须进行民主补课。党的各级领导部门，今后必须在各方面经常防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，并把与侵入党内的一切资产阶级思想作风作斗争当作一个长期的、重大的政治任务。为此，必须有计划地组织干部、党员学习马克思、列宁主义，学习毛泽东思想，以提高理论水平和思想水平。（二）正确地处理贪污分子，清洗坏分子出党，交代干部与资产阶级的关系，审查干部，完成整编。（三）大量提拔和培养干部：一方面，要提拔在运动中涌现的大批积极分子，以应当前工作的急需；另方面，为了适应大规模经济建设的需要，必须大量培养新的技术干部，办好专门学校和各种技术学校，组织业余的技术学习，各级党的组织应保证这一任务的完成。（四）积极发展新党员，有计划地、有步骤地在工人群众中、在机关、企业和学校中，在农村的互助组、生产合作社、国营农场和集体农场中，吸收优秀的积极分子入党。（五）改善领导作风，及时联系业务、抓住关键、检查工作、发现问题和解决问题、总结先进经验，以提高政策水平和业务水平，推动工作前进；反对那种“马后炮”式的、公式主义的、形式主义的总结，彻底转变官僚主义的作风。
    会议一致同意了高岗同志的报告，在小组和大会的讨论中，大家的发言充满了批评和自我批评的精神，一致地认为：毛主席和党中央所号召和领导的“三反”“五反”运动，是一个具有历史意义的伟大革命运动，是完全适时的和完全正确的，党中央的领导是十分英明的。东北地区党的组织，执行了党中央的路线和政策，取得了“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，提高了全党的思想水平和政治觉悟，巩固了和纯洁了党的组织，大大地加强了党的战斗力。因此，大家对于完成今后各项工作任务，更加具有充分信心。会议结束后，大会的决议马上见诸行动，东北局根据“三反”运动后的情况，调动了若干领导干部；同时，东北局和东北军区都组织了一批干部，对各部门的工作进行严格的检查，以保证会议精神的切实贯彻。
