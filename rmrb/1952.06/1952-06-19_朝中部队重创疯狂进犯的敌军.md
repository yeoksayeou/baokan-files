Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th: The American aggressors, using every trick to delay the armistice negotiations, have launched frantic offensives in many areas along the front, the likes of which haven't been seen in over four months. They are using forces of up to a regiment in size, firing 50,000 to 70,000 artillery shells along the entire line each day. In the battles to bravely repel the advancing enemy, the infantry and artillery units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have played a huge role, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy's manpower.

On the Western Front, the US aggressor army's 45th Division, on the 12th, with approximately two battalions of troops, under the cover of 52 aircraft, 34 tanks, and a large amount of artillery fire, fiercely attacked Hill 190.8 west of Tieyuan and the surrounding hills. Seven charges were repelled by our army's fierce firepower. The enemy suffered more than 400 casualties in one day. Since then, the enemy has continued to relentlessly attack the area, but has still been heavily battered by our army. Our infantry, relying on solid fortifications and the support of powerful artillery, engaged the enemy in fierce mountain battles. As of the 15th, fighting was still raging in the area. According to preliminary calculations, the US aggressor army has suffered nearly a thousand casualties.

On the Central Front, the enemy, about a regiment in size, advanced on two high ground southeast of Kimhwa on the 12th, in coordination with tanks and artillery fire. More than 30 consecutive charges were crushed by our army, and the enemy suffered more than 600 casualties. On the 13th, the enemy again used seven companies of troops, under the cover of 24 tanks, to continue attacking the area. Our defending forces immediately bombarded the enemy with fierce artillery fire and continuously launched counterattacks, repelling more than 30 enemy charges, killing and wounding more than 500 enemy soldiers, destroying five enemy tanks, and damaging two. On the 14th, a battalion of the US aggressor army's 40th Division attacked a high ground southwest of Kimhwa three times, but were repelled by our army, and the enemy suffered more than 100 casualties.

On the Eastern Front, an enemy battalion attacked Hill 890.2 west of Mundung-ri on the 13th. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were repelled by our army, and the enemy suffered more than 170 casualties.

    朝中部队重创疯狂进犯的敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】用尽一切伎俩来拖延停战谈判的美国侵略者，又在前线许多地方发动四个多月来所没有过的疯狂进犯。使用兵力多到一个团，每天在全线向我发射炮弹五万发到七万多发。在奋勇迎击进犯敌人的战斗中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的步兵部队和炮兵部队都发挥了巨大的作用，使敌军有生力量遭到惨重的损失。
    在西线，美国侵略军第四十五师十二日以约两个营的兵力，在五十二架飞机、三十四辆战车及大量炮火掩护下，猛犯铁原以西一九零点八高地及其附近山头，七次冲锋都被我军猛烈火力击退，敌军在一天中死伤四百多名。此后敌军继续不断地向该地猛扑，但仍然受到我军的痛击。我军步兵凭借坚固的工事和强大炮兵的支援，与敌展开激烈的山地争夺战。到十五日为止，战斗仍在该地激烈进行中。据初步计算，美国侵略军先后已伤亡了近千名。
    在中线，敌军约一个团，十二日在战车和炮火配合下进犯金城东南的两个高地，连续冲锋三十多次，都被我军击溃，敌军伤亡六百多名。十三日，敌军又以七个连兵力，在二十四辆战车掩护下继续向该地进犯。我守军当即以猛烈炮火轰击敌军，并不断地进行阵地反击，打垮敌军三十多次冲锋，杀伤敌军五百多名，并击毁敌战车五辆，击伤两辆。十四日，美国侵略军第四十师一个营，三次进犯金城西南的一个高地，都被我军击退，敌军伤亡一百多名。
    在东线，敌军一个营十三日进犯文登里以西八九零点二高地，激战两个小时，被我军击退，敌军死伤一百七十多名。
