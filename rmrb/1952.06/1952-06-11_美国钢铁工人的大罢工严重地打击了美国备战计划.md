    The Great Strike of American Steel Workers Seriously Hits the U.S. War Preparation Plan

    Six hundred and fifty thousand American steel workers began a nationwide strike on the 2nd of this month to fight for higher wages and improved working conditions. At the same time, workers in other related industries who were shut down due to the steel industry strike reached 100,000; as of the 4th of this month, the total number of strikers in the United States was 750,000. This is the largest strike action by American workers in recent years.

    This strike, occurring in the steel industry, an important military production sector in the United States, fully exposes the serious crisis in the U.S. war preparation economy.

    As a result of the Truman government's frantic pursuit of an arms expansion and war preparation policy, the living conditions of the American working people are constantly deteriorating. The heavy burden of military spending has almost plundered 50 percent of the average income of American workers and employees; at the same time, their real wages are also decreasing, having fallen by 20 to 25 percent in 1951 alone compared to the pre-war period. Clearly, the U.S. war preparation economy has completely plunged the American working people into abject poverty. This cannot but make the American working people rise up and fight to improve their living conditions. The growth of the American strike movement vividly illustrates this fact.

    The great strike of American steel workers proves that the contradictions between the American working class and American monopoly capitalists, which have been sharpened by arms expansion and war preparation, have reached an irreconcilable level. American steel workers have been negotiating with American steel industry capitalists for seven months since the end of last year to demand higher wages and improved working conditions. During this period, U.S. President Truman and the right-wing leader of the Steelworkers Union, Murray, exhausted all methods, even adopting the means of government takeover of the steel industry, to delay and undermine the workers' strike actions. However, the capitalists who have made huge fortunes in the arms expansion and war preparation movement have refused to make concessions even to the suggestions put forward by the U.S. government's "Wage Stabilization Board" to partially meet the workers' demands. Therefore, the workers resolutely took strike action when they could no longer endure it.

    This has made the myth of the "prosperity" of the U.S. war economy even more thoroughly bankrupt. The fact that the U.S. civilian industry has been drastically reduced due to arms expansion and war preparation has long sounded the alarm for the crisis in the U.S. war preparation economy, and now the great strike of 650,000 steel workers further shows that even in the U.S. military production sector, there are irresolvable contradictions and crises. This is enough to illustrate the seriousness of the U.S. war preparation economic crisis.

    This is, of course, a serious blow to the U.S. arms expansion and war preparation plan. The U.S. warmongers have therefore felt great panic and annoyance. However, if the Truman government continues its arms expansion and war preparation policy, it will inevitably suffer even greater political and economic crises one after another!

### 美国钢铁工人的大罢工严重地打击了美国备战计划

    美国钢铁工人的大罢工严重地打击了美国备战计划
    美国六十五万钢铁工人为了争取提高工资和改善劳动条件，已于本月二日开始举行全国性的大罢工。同时，因受钢铁工业罢工影响而停业的其他有关产业的工人亦达十万人；至本月四日为止，美国罢工人数总共为七十五万人。这是美国工人近年来规模最大的一次罢工行动。
    这次罢工发生在美国重要军事生产部门的钢铁业中，充分暴露了美国备战经济的严重危机。
    由于杜鲁门政府疯狂地推行扩军备战政策的结果，美国劳动人民的生活状况正不断恶化。沉重的军费负担，几乎掠夺了美国工人和雇员平均收入的百分之五十；与此同时，他们的实际工资也在减少，仅在一九五一年即较战前降低了百分之二十至二十五。显然，美国的备战经济已使美国劳动人民完全陷入赤贫了。这不能不使美国劳动人民为争取改善生活状况而奋起斗争。美国罢工运动的增长生动地说明了这一事实。
    美国钢铁工人的大罢工，证明了美国工人阶级与美国独占资本家之间，因扩军备战而更加尖锐化了的矛盾已经到了难以缓和的程度了。美国钢铁工人为要求提高工资和改善劳动条件，自去年年底以来已与美国钢铁业资本家进行了七个月的谈判。在此期间，美国总统杜鲁门和钢铁工会的右翼领袖莫莱，为了缓和工人们的反抗，曾用尽了一切方法，甚至采用了由政府接管钢铁工业的手段，来拖延和破坏工人们的罢工行动。但是，在扩军备战运动中发了大财的资本家们，甚至对美国政府“工资稳定委员会”所提出的部分满足工人要求的建议，也拒绝让步。因而工人们在忍无可忍的情况下坚决地采取了罢工行动。
    这使美国战争经济的“繁荣”的神话更加彻底地破产了。美国民用工业因扩军备战而急剧缩减的事实，早已为美国备战经济的危机敲了警钟，而现在六十五万钢铁工人的大罢工，更显示出即使在美国的军事生产部门中，也都存在着不可解决的矛盾和危机。这就足以说明美国备战经济危机的严重性了。
    对于美国的扩军备战计划，这当然是一个严重的打击。美国战争贩子们已因此而感到了极大的恐慌和烦恼。但是，杜鲁门政府如果继续它的扩军备战政策的话，它就一定要遭受到接踵而来的更大的政治和经济的危机！
