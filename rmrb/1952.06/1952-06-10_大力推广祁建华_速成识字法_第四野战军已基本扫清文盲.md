Vigorously Promote Qi Jianhua's "Accelerated Literacy Method"
The Fourth Field Army Has Basically Eliminated Illiteracy
Since the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army began vigorously promoting Qi Jianhua's accelerated literacy method, it has basically eliminated illiteracy in less than two months. Now, the vast majority of officers and soldiers can generally read magazines and newspapers such as "Soldier's Life" and "Combatant" published by the army, and a large number of comrades can already write short articles of several hundred words. Nearly half of the contributions to the tenth issue of the "Combatant" newspaper were written by the soldiers themselves, who introduced their learning experiences. In the companies, popular newspapers like "Combatant" have become the favorite reading material for officers and soldiers. The entire army's learning outlook has been completely renewed. What used to take us several years to accomplish, we have now solved in two months. This is a major victory in the cultural and educational construction of our army, laying the foundation for the army to move towards a modernized national defense force. From this learning process, we see that the people's soldiers are not only hardworking and brave, but also intelligent. We have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and we have the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so we can overcome any difficulties.

The leading organs of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army attach great importance to the creation of accelerated literacy methods. As early as April of last year, Qi Jianhua was invited to give demonstration lessons and introduce his experience; the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army also sent special personnel to assist in summarizing the experience. The results proved that Qi Jianhua's accelerated literacy method is a good method for quickly eliminating illiteracy. Whether it is cadres, soldiers, young people, or old people, southerners or northerners, all have achieved good results after concentrated teaching. After having relatively complete experience, the Fourth Field Army promoted it throughout the army this year. The leading organs of the department first convened a representative meeting of cultural instructors from the entire army, widely introduced the teaching experience of accelerated literacy, systematically trained the instructors, and made on-site observations.

Let’s take two examples: The accelerated literacy education in a certain division began on January 5th of this year and ended on March 7th (according to the schedule, it was supposed to end on March 15th), with a total of 278.5 hours of study (the actual crash course on new characters took up 76.5 hours). According to the test results: the average achievement of the entire division's students in consolidating single characters was 2,351 characters, of which 85% of the students achieved 2,300 characters or more; the worst was 2,000 characters, accounting for 0.8% of the students. A certain division began teaching using the accelerated literacy method on January 5th of this year, and conducted a test at the end of February. The results were: the first teaching class averaged 2,128 characters recognized per person, with 89% of the characters being consolidated; the second teaching class averaged 2,306 characters recognized per person, with 96.7% being consolidated; the third teaching class averaged 2,353 characters recognized per person, with 98.5% being consolidated; the fourth teaching class averaged 2,376 characters recognized per person, with 99.5% being consolidated. However, it should be explained here that this test was conducted fifteen days before the end of the accelerated literacy teaching. It is expected that by the end, all students in the division will be able to consolidate more than 2,000 single characters.

Cadres and soldiers used the spirit of charging into battle to learn. Some had their mouths swollen from reciting pinyin letters, but they still persisted until they learned them. In order to study during the day, they would rather work night shifts; some secretly used small flashlights to recognize characters while lying in their quilts; or used their fingers to draw back and forth on their bodies; some soldiers gave up their tobacco pipes and saved their allowances to buy pens and dictionaries.... A large number of learning heroes emerged.

Comrade Pang Jinman, a soldier from a hired peasant background, is a reconnaissance man in a certain unit. Since joining the army in 1948, he has deeply realized the difficulties of being uneducated in several years of arduous combat life. After the superiors proposed using the accelerated literacy method to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy in the army, he immediately responded to this call. He hoped to start learning from the first word and quickly improve his cultural level to become a modern national defense soldier with both literacy and military skills. Because he had such a correct ideological foundation, he could actively engage in learning. He listened attentively in class and reviewed diligently after class. He cut the new characters he learned each day into paper pieces and put them in one pocket; the ones he didn't know were put in another pocket, and he seized every spare moment to review them at any time until he learned them all. Due to diligent study and hard practice, he created a record of learning 2,128 new characters in thirty hours.

Examples like Comrade Pang Jinman are not isolated cases. We can find a large number of such figures in the companies. For example, Comrade Lu Shiyuan, a soldier of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, was a miner before joining the army and didn't even know his own name. But in five days of study, he recognized 1,800 new characters and was able to pick up popular books and newspapers and read them. In the past, Comrade Lu Shiyuan often said to others: "Now that the entire mainland of the country has been liberated, if we don't have culture, how can we be good soldiers of a modern national defense force in the future!" After the army started accelerated literacy education, he threw himself into the learning movement. But Lu Shiyuan did not have no difficulties in learning. On the first day of learning, although Lu Shiyuan memorized all thirty-seven phonetic symbols, he couldn't pronounce some of the sounds accurately, and his tongue couldn't get around them, so he was so anxious that he was covered in sweat. But he thought: "Who am I learning for? Isn't it for the motherland, for the people. In the past, I crossed mountains as high as ten thousand mountains and crossed seas as deep as the Qiongzhou Strait for the motherland and the people. Can new characters stop me?" So he mustered up his courage and successfully broke through this barrier. By the fifth day, he had rushed through the single-character book of 1,800 characters; in the evening, he picked up the army's third-grade primary school Chinese textbook and read it from beginning to end. In the book, he saw the names of Stalin and Mao Zedong with his own eyes, and read the stories of the Chinese people loving their leaders - he had heard and told these stories countless times in the past, but never felt so close to them as this time. Lu Shiyuan was so excited that he didn't sleep well all night.

After the accelerated literacy education, the erroneous views of some people that "workers and peasants are stupid; old people have poor memory and can't learn well!" have been corrected. In fact, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, thinks of more ways, and patiently helps the cadres and soldiers, they can also learn quickly and well.

For example, Comrade Xu Diansheng, the squad leader of a certain unit, is thirty-seven years old this year. When he started learning, his memory was indeed worse than that of ordinary young people, but judging from his past combat experience, he was a brave and resourceful person - he was a famous lone hero in the entire company, who had captured many enemies and made great contributions. When the accelerated literacy education began, the instructor did not understand his level of acceptance well, but treated him as an ordinary person and subjectively asked him to keep up with the progress. Before he had learned the phonetic symbols well, he turned to crashing the new characters, almost having to crash one or two hundred characters every day. When studying, he was always anxious and sweaty, following others to catch up. As a result, he forgot the old ones after learning the new ones, and he was so angry that he often beat his head with his fists, thinking that he was "stupid" and there was no way. He was very sad to see that others were advancing rapidly. He thought: "I am a party member and a squad leader. I have never fallen behind in combat and work in the past. Will I fall behind in cultural learning?" He didn't believe he would. He also thought of the spirit of the volunteers overcoming difficulties and defeating the enemy, and his courage came. The comrades who inspected the work encouraged him and pointed out that the reason why he did not learn well was not that he was stupid, but that his learning method was not right. Later, he and several other comrades who had "fallen behind" were gathered together and started learning anew. In the beginning, he was taught less and asked to review more; and he was patiently guided to open the "door" in his mind. On the first day, Xu Diansheng cut the new characters he learned into thirty small squares of paper and carried out "individual breakthroughs". By the evening, he had memorized the thirty characters thoroughly. The next day, he learned seventy characters and memorized fifty of them. After that, he made progress day by day, and learned more than 400 characters in a few days. From then on, no one in the company said he was stupid anymore, and he also put down the burden of being "stupid". Comrade Xu Diansheng's example shows that adults' memory is not bad. They have the advantage of "strong comprehension". As long as they make good use of this advantage, they can also learn very well.

The cultural instructors of the troops, because they established the concept of "serving the soldiers", played an active and creative role in teaching, and they wholeheartedly strived to improve the cultural level of the troops. When many instructors make lesson plans, they always take the lesson plans to the class and solicit the opinions of the soldiers at any time to meet the needs of the soldiers; they learn the vocabulary of the soldiers and pay attention to improving teaching methods and inspiring the wisdom of the soldiers at all times. They all said: "We have taught the soldiers, and at the same time, we have learned a lot from the soldiers and enriched our knowledge."

The main reason why the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army has achieved success in accelerated literacy education is that our party and our army have always attached importance to cultural education. At the end of last year, the entire army held the first cultural and educational representative meeting, and arranged the work of accelerated literacy education. The units at all levels also convened many meetings to carry out ideological mobilization, formulate teaching plans, and make necessary material preparations. The political work of the troops ensured the completion of the teaching tasks.

In order to further carry out the cultural and educational work of the troops, all commanders and fighters are mobilizing all their strength, overcoming all difficulties, and carrying forward the revolutionary heroic spirit to complete the historical task of improving the culture of the troops.

    大力推广祁建华“速成识字法”
    第四野战军已基本扫清文盲
    中国人民解放军第四野战军部队，自大力推行祁建华速成识字法以来，在不到两个月的时间中，基本上扫清了文盲。现在广大的干部、战士一般都能阅读部队出版的“战士生活”、“战斗员”等杂志报刊，有一大部分同志已经能写几百字的短文了。第十期“战斗员”报上面有近一半的稿子是战士自己写的，他们介绍了自己的学习心得。在连队中，像“战斗员”这样的通俗报纸已成为干部和战士们最爱好的读物了。整个部队的学习面貌已为之焕然一新。过去我们需要几年才能做到的事情，现在我们在两个月内就解决了。这是我们部队文化教育建设上的一大胜利，给部队打下了走向现代化国防军的基础。从这个学习过程中，我们看到人民的战士不但勤劳、勇敢，而且聪明。我们有着光荣的革命传统，我们有共产党和毛主席的领导，什么样困难都能克服。
    人民解放军第四野战军领导机关非常重视速成识字法的创造。远在去年四月，即聘请祁建华来作示范教学，介绍经验；第四野战军政治部并派专人协助总结经验。结果证明：祁建华速成识字法是迅速消灭文盲的好方法，无论干部、战士、青年或老年，南方人和北方人，经集中教学后，都获得良好的成绩。第四野战军在有了比较完整的经验后，即于本年度在全军推广。该部领导机关先召集了全军文化教员代表会议，广泛介绍速成识字教学经验，有计划地训练了教员，并作了实地观摩。
    这里举两个例子来说吧：某师的速成识字教育，是从今年一月五日开始的，到三月七日结束（按进度是三月十五日结束），共经过了二百七十八点五小时的学习（实际突击生字占去七十六点五小时）。根据测验的结果：全师学员巩固单字的成绩总平均为二千三百五十一个字，其中个人成绩达二千三百字以上者占学员总数的百分之八十五；最差的是两千字，占学员总数的百分之零点八。某师在今年一月五日开始用速成识字法进行教学，二月底进行了
    一次测验，结果是：第一教学班平均每人识二千一百二十八个字，能巩固的字占百分之八十九；第二教学班平均每人识二千三百零六个字，能巩固的占百分之九十六点七；第三教学班平均每人识二千三百五十三字，能巩固的占百分之九十八点五；第四教学班平均每人识二千三百七十六个字，能巩固的占百分之九十九点五。但这里应该加以说明，这次测验离速成识字教学结束时间还有十五天，预计到结束时，全师学员能巩固两千个以上的单字。
    干部和战士都用打冲锋的精神来进行学习。有的因为念拼音字母把嘴都念肿了，但他们还是坚持着直到念会为止。为了白天的学习，他们宁愿在夜晚值勤；有的睡在被窝里的时候还偷偷地用小手电照着认字；或者用手指在自己的身体上来回地划着；有的战士甩掉了烟袋，节省下津贴费去买钢笔、字典……。大批的学习英雄涌现出来了。
    雇农出身的战士庞金满同志，是某部的侦察员。他从一九四八年参军以来，在几年的艰苦战斗生活中，深深地体会了没有文化的困难。上级提出了用速成识字法来完成扫清部队中文盲的任务后，他马上响应了这个号召。他希望从第一个字开始学起，很快地把自己的文化水平提高，当一个文武双全的现代化国防军战士。因为他有了这样正确的思想基础，才能积极地进行学习。他上课时用心听，下课后勤复习，他把每天学得的生字，剪成纸块放在一个裤袋里；不会的放在另一个裤袋里，抓紧每一个空隙时间随时进行复习，直到全部学会了为止。由于苦学苦练，他创造了三十个小时学会二千一百二十八个生字的纪录。
    像庞金满同志这样的例子并不是个别的，我们可以在连队中大量地发现这样的人物。如某部四中队战士鹿世元同志，参军前是个矿工，连自己的名字也不认识。但他在五天的学习中认识了一千八百个生字，而且能拿起通俗的书报来念了。以前鹿世元同志经常对别人说：“现在全国大陆都解放了，咱没有文化，将来怎么当好一个现代化国防军的战士呀！”部队开始速成识字教育以后，他就投入了学习运动。但鹿世元在学习中并不是没有困难的。学习的第一天，鹿世元虽然把三十七个注音符号都记会了，可是有几个字音咬不准，舌头总绕不过弯来，因此使他急得满头大汗。但他想到：“我是为谁学习呢？还不是为了祖国，为了人民。以前我为祖国为人民曾经越过了像十万大山那样高的山，渡过了像琼州海峡那样深的海水，难道生字就能把我绊住吗？”于是他鼓起了勇气，胜利地突破了这一关。到第五天，他就突击完了一千八百个字的单字本；晚上，他拿起了部队的小学国语第三册课本，从头念到尾。在书上他亲眼看到了斯大林、毛泽东的名字，读到中国人民热爱领袖的故事——这些事他过去不知讲过和听过多少遍了，可是总没有这一次亲切。鹿世元兴奋得一晚上没有很好地睡觉。
    经过了速成识字教育以后，某些人的“工农出身的人脑子笨；年纪大记忆力差，学不好！”的错误观点被纠正过来了。事实上只要领导方面重视，多想办法，耐心地给干部和战士以帮助，他们同样可以学得快，学得好。
    譬如，某部班长徐殿生同志，今年三十七岁了。开始学习时，他的记忆力确比一般青年人差些，但从他过去的战斗经历来看，他是个英勇、机智的人——他是全中队有名的孤胆英雄，曾经俘掳过很多敌人，立过大功。速成识字教育开始时，教员没有很好地了解他的接受程度，而把他当作一般人看待，主观地要求他赶进度。他还没有学好注音符号，就转入了突击生字，几乎每天都要突击上一二百字。学习时他总是急得满头大汗，跟着别人赶。结果学了新的忘了旧的，气得他时常用拳头捶自己的脑袋，认为自己“笨”，没有办法。他看到别人都飞快地前进了，他心里十分难受。他想：“自己是个党员，又是个班长，过去在战斗和工作中都没有落后过，难道在文化学习上就会掉队吗？”他不相信自己会这样。他又想到志愿军克服困难战胜敌人的精神，他的勇气就来了。检查工作的同志便鼓励他，指出他学习不好的原因不是心笨，而是学习的方法不对头。后来就把他和其他几个“掉了队”的同志集合起来，从新学习。开始时讲得少，让他多多复习；并耐心地加以指导，打开他脑子里的“窍门”。第一天，徐殿生把学的生字用纸片剪成三十个小方块，进行“各个突破”，到晚上，三十个字已记得烂熟了。第二天学了七十个字，他记住了五十个。以后，他便一天比一天进步了，几天中就学会了四百多字。从此，中队里再也没谁说他笨了，他自己也放下了“笨”的包袱。徐殿生同志的例子，说明了成年人的记忆力并不差。他们具有着“理解力强”的优点，只要很好地发挥他们的这一优点，他们同样能学得很好。
    部队的文化教员由于确立了“为兵服务”的观点，在教学中发挥了积极性和创造性，他们全心全意为提高部队文化水平而努力。许多教员作教案时，总是把教案拿到班里去做，随时征求战士的意见，满足战士的需要；学习战士的语汇，时刻注意改进教学方法，启发战士们的智慧。他们都说：“教了战士，同时也向战士们学了不少东西，丰富了自己的知识。”
    人民解放军第四野战军速成识字教育取得成绩的主要原因，乃是由于我党我军一贯地重视文化教育。去年末，全军举行了第一届文教代表会，布置了速成识字教育工作。各级部队又专门召开了多次的会议，进行思想动员，制订教学计划，并做好了必要的物质准备。而部队的政治工作则保证了教学任务的完成。
    为了进一步开展部队的文化教育工作，全体指战员正动员一切力量，克服一切困难，发扬革命的英雄主义精神，完成提高部队文化的历史任务。
