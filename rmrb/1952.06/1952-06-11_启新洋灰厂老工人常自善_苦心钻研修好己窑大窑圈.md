    Qixin Cement Plant's Veteran Worker Chang Zishan
    Painstakingly Studies and Repairs the Big Kiln Ring of No. 6 Kiln
    Editor: Chang Zishan, a veteran worker in the calcination workshop of Qixin Cement Plant in Tangshan, has repaired the large kiln ring of No. 6 kiln through painstaking research, paving the way for the plant's patriotic production competition.
    No. 6 kiln was installed by a Briton named Winter (transliteration) in 1940. During installation, the center line was not properly set, and the contact force between the kiln ring and the rollers below was uneven. It gradually became uneven due to wear, causing the kiln to vibrate violently when rotating, preventing it from fully exerting its production efficiency. For eight years, this has been a major obstacle in the production of Qixin Cement Plant. If it is not repaired, there is a risk of cracking the machine base and electric rollers. However, due to the length and weight of the kiln body, dismantling the kiln ring for repair would require hundreds of workers; at the same time, the suspension of work for repairs would cause significant production losses. Some technicians believed that if the "foreigners" could not install it well, we would not be able to repair it either. Therefore, No. 6 kiln has never been repaired.
    Chang Zishan is fifty-nine years old this year and is an old technician with more than thirty years of experience in the factory and rich technical expertise. In October 1951, Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy. Chang Zishan responded to Chairman Mao's call and resolved to repair No. 6 kiln. The encouragement from the trade union strengthened Chang Zishan's confidence. Initially, he racked his brains, found many tricks, and the test results all failed. But he was not discouraged. He came early and left late every day and continued to actively think of ways. In January of this year, he finally came up with a solution: to build a "jiaoshou" (a frame made of wood) under the kiln ring and install a simple lathe on the "jiaoshou" board to smooth the uneven surface of the kiln ring as the kiln rotates. In order to resist vibration and pressure, he designed a baffle and tightly inlaid the cutter on the baffle to keep the cutter at a certain depth relative to the large ring. Two disc springs were placed behind the baffle to prevent excessive vibration of the cutter.
    The administrative side approved this method. With the help of five workmates, Li Yuancheng, Wang Chuanping, Lin Ruiping and others, Chang Zishan found the materials and equipped the furniture. Starting on March 29, Chang Zishan and his workmates worked non-stop to smooth the large kiln ring. Because No. 6 kiln was still running, the temperature was very high. Their eyes were smoked so much that they couldn't open them, and their clothes were soaked with sweat, but they still insisted on working for forty-eight hours and finally completed the repair task. After this repair, the vibration of No. 6 kiln during rotation was no longer as severe as before. By the end of April, the third large kiln ring of No. 6 kiln had also been smoothed.  Liu Enzhong

    启新洋灰厂老工人常自善
    苦心钻研修好己窑大窑圈
    编辑同志：唐山启新洋灰厂烧成车间老工人常自善，经过苦心钻研，修好了己窑大窑圈，为该厂爱国主义生产竞赛铺平了道路。
    己窑是在一九四○年由英国人温特（译音）安装的。安装时，中心线没有定好，窑圈和下面的滚轮接触力不平均，它渐渐被磨得凹凸不平，以致窑罐转动起来，震动很厉害，不能充分发挥生产效能。八年来，这已成为启新洋灰厂生产中的一个大障碍。如果不把它修理好，机台和电滚子都有震裂的危险。但由于窑身长，重量大，如将窑圈拆下来修理，需要用几百个工；同时停工修理，还要使生产受到很大损失。有些技术人员认为，“外国人”没办法安装好，我们也没有办法修理好。因此，己窑一直没有修成。
    常自善今年五十九岁，是一个有三十多年厂龄和丰富的技术经验的老技工。一九五一年十月，毛主席提出增产节约的号召，常自善响应毛主席的号召，决心要把己窑修好。工会的鼓励增强了常自善的信心。起初，他费了很多脑筋，找出许多窍门，试验结果都失败了。但他并不灰心，每天早来晚走，继续积极想办法。今年一月份，他终于想出了办法：在窑圈下搭个“交手”（用木头搭成的架子），“交手”板上安装简单的车床，随着窑的转动，镟光窑圈的不平面。为了抵抗震动及压力，他设计了一个挡板，把刀紧镶在挡板上，使车刀对大圈，保持一定的深度。在挡板后面顶住两个盘簧，防止车刀过分震动。
    经行政方面同意了这个办法。常自善在同组工友李元成、王传平、林瑞平等五人帮助下，找来工料，把家具装备妥当。三月二十九日开始，常自善和工友们时刻不停地镟大窑圈。因为己窑还在运转，温度很高。他们被熏得眼睛都睁不开，衣服都湿透了，但仍坚持工作四十八小时，终于完成了修理任务。经过这次修理，己窑转动时不再像从前那样震动了。到四月底，又将己窑的第三道大窑也镟完了。  刘恩中
