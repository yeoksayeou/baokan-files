    Inspection of the Yuanyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Unauthorized Reduction of Native Product Purchase Prices
    Editor: On May 16th, the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily published a reader's letter criticizing the Yuanyang County Cooperative in Pingyuan Province for violating its contract and unilaterally lowering the purchase price of native products. After seeing this criticism, we sent staff to investigate. We are now presenting the findings of the investigation and our handling of the matter as follows:
    In November of last year, the Yuanyang County Cooperative signed a contract with the Jiaozuo Native Products Company to purchase 70,000 jin of crude alkali on their behalf, but only signed contracts with disaster victims to purchase 40,000 jin of crude alkali. During the purchase, 40,000 jin were executed according to the contractually agreed price (with a difference of only 100 yuan per jin for third-grade alkali). However, when purchasing the remaining 30,000 jin of crude alkali, the county cooperative, without consulting the company, unilaterally lowered the purchase price (the price of first-grade alkali was reduced from 2,000 yuan per jin to 1,200 yuan; second-grade alkali from 1,800 yuan to 800 yuan; and third-grade alkali from 1,300 yuan to 600 yuan), while still quoting the original agreed-upon prices to the company. In this way, the county cooperative obtained an exorbitant profit of more than 24.5 million yuan. In addition, in the work of purchasing homespun cloth on behalf of the company, in addition to the 49,900 square feet that were reimbursed at the original agreed-upon price, the remaining portion was over-reported by more than 640,000 yuan.
    We believe that the Yuanyang County Cooperative's erroneous behavior of violating the contract and falsely reporting prices this time is quite serious. This fully demonstrates that the cooperative's leadership lacks clear policy viewpoints and a legal concept of abiding by contracts; it reflects a capitalist management style. However, the prices stipulated in the purchase contracts for the crude alkali and homespun cloth from disaster victims were originally set too high, so after reducing the purchase prices (which should have been adjusted), the disaster victims had no other objections. Based on the above situation, we propose the following handling suggestions for the county's erroneous behavior: First, the Yuanyang County Cooperative is ordered to conduct a thorough self-criticism of the matter and publish the results in the newspaper, guaranteeing that similar errors will not be repeated; second, we agree with the opinion of the Xinxiang Special District Financial and Economic Committee: the illegal profits obtained should be returned to the Jiaozuo Native Products Company.

### 关于原阳县供销社擅自降低土产收购价格的检查

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    关于原阳县供销社擅自降低土产收购价格的检查
    编辑同志：五月十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表读者来信，对平原省原阳县合作社违反合同擅自降低收购土产价格提出批评。我们看到这一批评以后，就派员前往进行检查。现在把检查情况和我们对这件事的处理意见分述如下：
    原阳县合作社在去年十一月和焦作土产公司签订了七万斤代购土碱合同，但与灾民只订了四万斤收购土碱的合同。在收购中，有四万斤是按照合同规定的价格执行的（其中只三等碱每斤相差一百元）。但是县社在收购其余三万斤土碱时，没有商得公司方面的同意，就擅自降低价格收购（头等碱每斤由二千元减至一千二百元；二等碱由一千八百元减至八百元；三等碱由一千三百元减至六百元），而向公司报价时则仍按原来议定的价格。这样，该县社就从中获得暴利二千四百五十多万元。此外，该社在代购土布工作中，除有四万九千九百平方尺是按原议定价格实报实销外，其余部分共多报了六十四万多元。
    我们认为原阳县合作社这次违反合同、虚报价格的错误行为是相当严重的。这十足地说明该社领导思想上缺乏明确的政策观点和遵守合同的法律观念；表现了资本主义经营作风。但是这次所订收购合同，收购灾民土碱、土布的价格本来订得过高，所以在减低价格（这是应当调整的）收购以后，灾民还没有其它意见。基于以上情况，我们对该县的错误行为提出以下处理意见：一、责令原阳县合作社对这件事作深刻检讨，并把结果在报纸上公布，保证不再犯类似错误；二、同意新乡专区财经委员会的意见：把获得的非法利润退还焦作土产公司。
