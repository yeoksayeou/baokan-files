Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: In the two years since Wall Street launched the war of aggression against Korea, history has recorded a shameful record of repeated defeats for the American aggressors. The American aggressors' military adventure has been thoroughly bankrupted by the powerful blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. Faced with the lessons of reality, many leading figures in the once all-powerful American ruling clique have had to hang their heads and admit defeat.

Since the Korean and Chinese People's Armies began fighting side by side in the winter of 1950, they have won successive victories, while the American aggressor forces have suffered repeated defeats and have become demoralized. This situation has caused great shock and confusion within the American ruling clique. First, after MacArthur's so-called "Christmas Offensive" was crushed, cries of panic erupted in the United States. The Republican "New York Herald Tribune" called MacArthur's defeat "the greatest defeat in the history of the American Army." Taft, a prominent Republican figure, also said that the American failure in Korea was "the most complete failure the United States has ever suffered." On December 20th of the same year, another Republican figure, former U.S. President Hoover, delivered a famous speech, shouting that "the United States has been defeated in Korea by Communist China. There are not enough troops in the world to defeat them." Hoover concluded that the Truman administration's method of aggression had failed. He said: "To engage in land warfare with the sparse ground forces of non-communist countries (i.e., the imperialist camp) against this communist continent (i.e., the peace and democracy camp) will be a war with no hope of victory, a war with no victorious political outcome."

After U.S. aggressor forces commander MacArthur was dismissed by Truman in April 1951 due to his defeats in the war of aggression against Korea, an unprecedented foreign policy "great debate" broke out in the United States. Marshall, one of the decision-makers of the Truman administration, openly admitted the predicament of the American aggression, having the will but not the means to win. He warned those American generals and politicians who were妄想 (literally "wildly fantasizing") about saving the Korean defeat by expanding the war that they could not launch a full-scale war of aggression at present because "our military strength is still insufficient to engage in a showdown," "America's strength is not strong enough," and "I am convinced that we are not ready."

Thus, the war of aggression against Korea has become a deeply regrettable and unprofitable business for the American capitalists. Even MacArthur, the culprit of the war of aggression against Korea, had to admit that the Korean War was a "clear failure." He told Democratic Congressman Kennedy last May: "We have not inflicted fatal damage on them (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Armies), but we ourselves are suffering heavy losses. American blood is being shed more and more." On March 22nd of this year, in a speech in Jackson, he again admitted that the goal of the United States in launching the war of aggression against Korea "is no closer to realization now than it was at the beginning." Moreover, the United States has exposed its fatal weakness to the world. MacArthur sadly said: "Since the founding of the country, the prestige of our country in the world has never been as low as it is now." Taft, who had supported MacArthur a year ago and clamored for expanding the Korean War, also changed his crazy tone by the end of last year. Now he says: "Every goal of the Korean War has failed." "We cannot find a more tragic example than the Korean War."

The admission of failure comes not only from the so-called "opposition" attacking the current government but also from the Truman administration itself. General Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted in a radio address last September: "The Korean War is the most costly and bloodiest war the United States has ever fought." This heavy sacrifice and failure were indeed beyond the expectations of the American aggressor chieftains. On January 1st of this year, Dulles, then a senior adviser to the U.S. State Department and one of the creators of the war of aggression against Korea, admitted in a radio address that the "terrible sacrifices" suffered by the United States had not brought about the so-called "unification" and "security" of Korea (referring to the U.S. occupation of the entire Korean peninsula). Moreover, the failure of the war of aggression against Korea has made Dulles lose confidence in the current American policy of aggression, which he himself had helped to formulate. In a speech on May 15th of this year, he lamented that the United States had fallen into the quagmire of the Korean War, saying that the American policy of aggression "costs too much and gains too little" and that this policy is very inappropriate.

It is precisely because all plans have failed that the United States has accepted the proposal to hold armistice negotiations. However, it still wants to use all kinds of despicable means to obstruct and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations,妄想 (literally "wildly fantasizing") to obtain at the negotiating table what they cannot obtain on the battlefield, but this approach will only bring greater failures and more serious consequences to themselves. Paul Baldwin, a reactionary American military commentator, wrote in the "New York Times" on March 27th that delaying the armistice negotiations is not good for the United States because "time is on the enemy's side." Another commentator, Lippmann, admitted that delaying the Korean armistice negotiations will undermine morale on the American front and at home, saying that the current negotiating method has had "a great and frustrating effect on (American) people's confidence."

As the war prolongs, the American aggressors cannot but fearfully see the fact that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are becoming stronger and stronger, while the American aggressor forces are being weakened day by day. Van Fleet recently told "U.S. News & World Report" that "the enemy in Korea is now stronger than ever before. ... It has greater strength in both offensive and defensive aspects than it had last summer." On May 26th, United Press International Washington also revealed that Ridgway also said in secret testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that "if the United Nations forces (i.e., the U.S. aggressor forces) launch a new offensive, they will suffer heavy casualties because the Chinese communists have good positions and their troops have been strengthened." Even clearer was the "Time" magazine published on March 10th. This important mouthpiece of Wall Street said: "It is now clear that the United States will not win the Korean War. ... In the eight months of armistice negotiations, the American army has become weaker and weaker, while the enemy (referring to the Korean and Chinese People's Armies) has become stronger and stronger." The facts will eventually tell the American aggressors that their delaying the armistice is nothing but a foolish act that outweighs the gains.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Allison said: "There is too much defeatism" in the discussion of the Korean issue (Associated Press, Philadelphia, March 5th). Needless to say, the "defeatism" of the American ruling clique is only because it cannot change the fact that the American aggressors cannot reverse the established defeat no matter what means they use.魏冈特 (Wei Gangte), a reporter for the reactionary American Hearst newspaper group, summed up the tragic end of the American military adventure in Korea in a telegram on June 4th, saying that Washington has "failed to defeat the enemy and failed to achieve victory" in the Korean War it directed for two years. That is to say, the Korean War has become a stone that the United States lifted only to drop on its own feet.

### 美统治集团承认侵朝战争失败

    美统治集团承认侵朝战争失败
    【新华社二十六日讯】在华尔街发动侵朝战争的两年间，历史写下了美国侵略者一败再败的可耻纪录。美国侵略者的军事冒险在朝中人民军队的强大打击下已经彻底破产。在事实的教训面前，曾经是不可一世的美国统治集团中许多首脑人物，已不得不垂头丧气，承认失败。
    朝中人民军队自从一九五○年冬并肩作战以来，连战连胜，美国侵略军则连战连败，一蹶不振。这种情况使美国统治集团中间发生了极大的震动和混乱。首先从麦克阿瑟的所谓“圣诞节攻势”被粉碎以后，美国国内就发出了一片惊慌的喊叫。共和党的“纽约先驱论坛报”把麦克阿瑟的失败叫做“美国陆军史上最大的失败”。著名的共和党头子塔夫脱也说：美国在朝鲜的失败是“美国从未遭受到的最完全的失败”。同年十二月二十日，又一个共和党头子，美国前总统胡佛发表了著名的演说，大叫
    “美国在朝鲜已被共产党中国所打败了。世界上没有足够的部队来打败他们。”胡佛断定杜鲁门政府的侵略方法到此已经破产。他说：“以非共产主义国家（按即帝国主义阵营）的稀少的地面部队，去和这个共产主义大陆（按即和平民主阵营）进行陆地战争，将是一个没有胜利希望的战争，没有胜利的政治结局的战争。”
    在一九五一年四月美国侵略军总司令麦克阿瑟因侵朝败绩而被杜鲁门撤职以后，美国国内又爆发了历史上空前的外交政策“大辩论”。杜鲁门政府的决策人之一马歇尔公开承认美国侵略有心、求胜无方的苦衷。他告诫那些妄想借扩大战争来挽救朝鲜败局的美国将领与政客目前还不能发动全面的侵略战争，原因是：“我们的军事力量仍然不足以进行摊牌”，“美国的力量还不够强大”，“我确信我们还没有准备好”。
    这样，侵略朝鲜的战争对美国大资本家说来已成为一笔伤心透顶的蚀本生意。甚至侵朝战争的祸首麦克阿瑟都不能不承认：朝鲜战争是一场“明白无疑的失败”。他在去年五月向民主党众议员肯尼第说：“我们并没有使他们（按指朝中人民军队）遭受致命的损害，而我们自己却在遭受重大的损失。美国人流的血越来越多了。”今年三月二十二日，他在杰克逊发表的演说中又承认：美国发动侵朝战争的目的“现在并没有比开始时更接近实现”。不仅如此，美国反而在全世界面前暴露了自己致命的脆弱性，麦克阿瑟伤心地说：“自从开国以来，我国在全世界的声望从来没有像现在这样低落过。”一年以前还曾支持麦克阿瑟、叫嚣扩大朝鲜战争的塔夫脱，到去年年底也改变了那种疯狂的论调。现在他的说法是：“朝鲜战争每一个目标都失败了。”“我们找不出比朝鲜战争更悲惨的例子了。”
    自认失败不仅来自攻击现政府的所谓“反对派”，而且也来自杜鲁门政府本身。美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷去年九月曾在广播演说中承认：“朝鲜战争是美国所进行的一次代价最大、流血最多的战争。”这种惨重的牺牲和失败，确实出于美国侵略头子们当初的预料之外。今年一月一日，侵朝战争的制造人之一，当时的美国国务院高级顾问杜勒斯在广播演说中承认，美国所遭受的“可怕的牺牲”并没有带来他所谓的朝鲜的“统一”与“安全”
    （按指美国对全朝鲜的占领）。不仅如此，侵朝战争的失败还使杜勒斯对于他自己曾亲手参与制定的美国现行侵略政策都丧失了信心。他在今年五月十五日发表的演说中惋惜美国陷入朝鲜战争的泥淖，他说：美国的侵略政策“代价太大而收获太少”，这种政策很不适当。
    正是因为一切计划都失败了，所以，美国才接受了举行停战谈判的建议。但是，它却还想使用种种卑鄙手段来阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，妄想在会议桌上取得他们在战场上所不能取得的东西，但是这种做法只有给他们自己带来更大的失败和更严重的恶果。美国反动军事评论家鲍尔温在三月二十七日的“纽约时报”撰文说：停战谈判拖延下去对美国没有好处，因为“时间对敌人是有利的”。另一个评论家李普曼承认，拖延朝鲜停战谈判将瓦解美国前后方的士气，他说，目前的谈判方式“对（美国）人民的信心”产生了“很大的令人沮丧的作用”。
    随着战争的延长，美国侵略者还不能不恐惧地看到朝中人民军队愈战愈强、美国侵略军却日益削弱的事实。最近范佛里特向“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志发表谈话说：“现在敌人在朝鲜比已往任何时候都强大。……它在进攻和防御两方面都有比去年夏天更大的力量。”五月二十六日，合众社华盛顿电又透露，李奇微在参院军事委员会秘密作证时也说：“联合国军（按即美国侵略军）如发动新攻势，就会遭受重大伤亡，因为共军已有良好阵地，他们的部队已经增强。”说得更明白的是三月十日出版的“时代”周刊，这家华尔街的重要喉舌说：“现在明显的是：美国不会赢得朝鲜战争了。……在八个月的停战谈判中，美国的军队愈来愈弱了，而敌人（指朝中人民军队）却愈来愈强。”事实终将告诉美国侵略者，他们延不停战不过是得不偿失的愚蠢行为而已。
    美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿艾利逊说：在朝鲜问题的讨论中，“失败主义太多了”（美联社费城三月五日电）。不消说，美国统治集团的“失败主义”只是由于无法改变这样的事实：美国侵略者不论使用什么手段都不能挽回业已铸定的败局。反动的美国赫斯特系报纸记者魏冈特在六月四日的电讯里总结美国在朝鲜的军事冒险的悲惨结局说：两年来，华盛顿在它所导演的朝鲜战争中“没有能够打败敌人，没有能够取得胜利”。这就是说，朝鲜战争已经成为美国搬起来打在自己脚上的石头。
