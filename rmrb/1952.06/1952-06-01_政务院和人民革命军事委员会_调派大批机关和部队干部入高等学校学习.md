Xinhua News Agency, 29th: In order to cultivate a large number of senior construction talents to meet the needs of the country's upcoming large-scale construction, the Central People's Government Administration Council and the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission have decided to transfer a large number of cadres from government organs and military units to study in universities. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, together with relevant departments, has studied and discussed specific issues such as allocation plans, admission requirements for cadres, and post-admission treatment. After preparations and review by various regions, the cadres transferred from various regions have now been concentrated in designated schools in their respective regions. Several universities in North China have received more than 2,000 cadres from government organs and military units and have begun remedial studies.

　　Those transferred this time generally have a cultural level equivalent to the second year of high school or above, are in good health, ideologically progressive, have a clear history, and are cadres under the age of thirty. After entering the school, they are assigned to "cadre training classes" specially established for them by each school. Each school has begun to vigorously and selectively tutor them in basic courses such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry. It is planned to provide about three months of remedial training, and then, based on their grades and preferences, they will be assigned to various departments and faculties of the schools.

　　These cadres, especially military cadres, have a relatively high political awareness, have been tempered, and have a strong sense of organization and discipline. They are enthusiastic about political and cultural studies. They generally love labor and are simple and hardworking. All of these qualities have aroused the love of teachers, students, and staff of the schools. Students have expressed that they will learn from them.

    调派大批机关和部队干部入高等学校学习
    【新华社二十九日讯】为了大量培养高级建设人才，以适应国家即将到来的大规模建设需要，中央人民政府政务院、中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会决定调派机关和部队的大批干部进入高等学校学习。中央人民政府教育部与有关部门经过研究讨论，解决了调配计划、入学干部条件、入学后待遇等具体问题。经过各地区的准备和审查工作，目前各地区所调干部均已分别在各地区指定的学校集中。华北区几个高等学校已接收了机关和部队干部二千余人，开始了补课学习。
    这次抽调的一般都是相当于高中二年级以上程度的文化水平，身体健康，思想进步，历史清楚，年龄在三十岁以下的干部。他们入学后，被编入各校专门为他们成立的“干部补习班”。各校已开始大力地、有重点地为他们补习数学、物理、化学等基本课程。预备补习三个月左右，然后根据成绩与志愿，分配到各校各系科学习。
    这些干部，尤其是部队干部，由于政治觉悟较高，锻炼较多，组织性和纪律性也较强，有政治、文化学习的积极性，他们一般热爱劳动、艰苦朴素，这些都引起了各校师生员工的敬爱，学生们都表示要向他们学习。
