A Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Huadong Transportation College's Reply to Readers' Criticism
    To the Editors: On December 3rd of last year, the People's Daily published a reader's letter in its "Letters from Readers" column criticizing the chaotic situation at the Huadong Transportation College in Shanghai. We held a general meeting to discuss this matter. Now, we respond as follows:

    Our school began preparations in early August of last year and opened in mid-September. Due to limitations in material conditions, it was impossible to have complete teaching equipment. However, to run the school well, the school leadership is systematically and methodically improving the academic system and supplementing various teaching facilities. First, regarding the academic system, our school accepted some students from the private Nanjing Industrial College and the Guanghua University Special Course, and also enrolled some new students. Students studying and living together under the leadership of the same administrative system is precisely to save national expenditures and cultivate more talent; there was no chaotic situation. Second, regarding the construction of the auditorium, our school's original school buildings were insufficient, so an engineer from the East China Transportation Department volunteered to design and build an auditorium. The total construction cost was only 600 million yuan, not 2 billion yuan. Third, regarding engineering equipment: Our school's practice factory equipment is already somewhat established and is still being supplemented. As for various instruments, they have been largely procured. Fourth, regarding library equipment: Our school began preparing to establish a library after the start of the school year and has successively purchased more than 3,000 new books. New books are still being added continuously. Transportation departments in various provinces and regions of East China have also donated a large number of books. Fifth, our school's campaign to establish a patriotic pact began in October of last year, and it played a significant enlightening and promoting role for teachers and students. In terms of conservation, the consumption of water and electricity alone was reduced by one-third in November of last year. Sixth, our school's opening ceremony was held on the large playground. The platform was built by the students themselves, and the scene was simple and unadorned; there was no extravagance or waste. As for students withdrawing or transferring, it was all done in accordance with regulations. Teachers have not taught in English.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    华东交通专科学校对读者批评的答复
    编辑同志：去年十二月三日人民日报读者来信栏发表读者来信，批评上海华东交通专科学校存在混乱现象。我们曾经召开大会，讨论了这件事情。现在，我们答复如下：
    我校于去年八月初开始筹办，九月中旬开学。由于物质条件的限制，教学设备不可能求其完备。但为了把学校办好，学校领导方面正在有计划、有步骤地改进学制和充实各项教学设备。第一，在学制方面，我校接收私立南京工业专科学校和光华大学专修科学生一部分，并招考一部分新生。在同一行政系统领导下，同学在一起学习、生活，正是为了节省国家开支，培养更多的人才，并没有发生混乱现象。第二，关于大礼堂的修建问题。我校原有校舍不敷应用，因此，由华东交通部的工程师义务设计，建造了一座礼堂。全部建筑费用只六亿元，并不是二十亿元。第三，关于工科设备：我校实习工厂设备已略具规模，现在仍在陆续充实，至于各种仪器，已大体置齐。第四，关于图书设备：我校在开学以后就着手筹设图书馆，陆续添购到三千多册新书。新的图书仍在不断添置中。华东各省区交通部门，也曾捐赠大批图书。第五，我校订立爱国公约的运动，是在去年十月展开的，它对教师、同学起了很大的启发和推动作用。节约方面，仅水电两项的消耗，去年十一月份节省了三分之一。第六，我校开学典礼是在大操场上举行的，台子是同学们自己搭的，场面简单朴素，没有铺张浪费的情形。至于同学退学、转学事宜，都按规定手续办理。教员也没有用英语讲授的情事。　华东交通专科学校
