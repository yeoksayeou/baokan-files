    Concentrate Strength to Lead the Masses to Struggle to Overcome Drought
    In the past month or so, severe drought has occurred in parts of North China, Northwest China, and Central South China. In many areas, autumn crops have not been planted, summer sowing of wheat fields has not been carried out in time, and shallow-rooted crops in many areas are withering due to the drought. Therefore, urgently mobilizing and launching a drought resistance struggle has become the overriding task of rural work in the aforementioned areas.
    As early as February 8th of this year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision calling for vigorously launching a mass-based drought prevention and resistance movement. Now, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued an urgent instruction calling for mobilizing the masses to launch a drought resistance struggle. We must act immediately to respond to this correct and timely call.
    Drought is a natural disaster that poses a significant threat to our agricultural production. If we lack understanding and become complacent and lax, agricultural production will suffer once a drought occurs, and it may lead to disasters such as epidemics, insect pests, and livestock deaths, which in turn will create difficulties in our economic construction. This is something we must always keep in mind.
    Drought can be overcome. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese people have fought against drought over the years, not only achieving great success but also accumulating rich experience. Experience tells us that the most important key is to fully carry out ideological mobilization and mass mobilization work, to educate the masses to understand the principle of "man can conquer nature," to overcome negative emotions and a fluke mentality among the masses, and to inspire the masses' initiative and creativity. As long as we do this, we can overcome the drought and ensure a normal harvest. In some areas where drought has already appeared this year, preliminary achievements have been made in the struggle against drought because the leading organs paid attention early and the masses' drought resistance struggle was launched early. For example, in the Anyang and Xinxiang regions of Pingyuan Province, even during the wheat harvest season, they began to pay attention to mobilizing the masses to water the land, achieving the goal of watering the land in the morning and threshing in the afternoon, ensuring that both the wheat harvest and summer sowing were not delayed.
    This year's summer drought in many areas is indeed very severe. We must mobilize all available forces to launch a drought resistance struggle. We need to do the following things well: first, strive to plant all the autumn crops; second, strive to plant crops on the wheat stubble land; third, strive to save the seedlings of existing crops. Our slogan is: "Do not leave an acre of land uncultivated, do not let a single seedling die!" To do these things well, we must organize and implement emergency planting and seedling protection. This requires fully utilizing all water sources, fully using all irrigation equipment, widely promoting various simple and effective irrigation methods, and strengthening management, paying attention to conservation, and reducing the amount of irrigation water to the lowest limit in order to expand the irrigated area and improve irrigation efficiency.
    The most serious responsibility must be borne by the leading organs of the Party and the People's Government at all levels. If we are indifferent or complacent and lax on such an issue that concerns the lives of the broad masses, if we fail to prepare in advance and are at a loss afterwards, it is a serious dereliction of duty and a serious act of bureaucratism! As long as the leading organs of the Party and the People's Government at all levels attach importance to this struggle and concentrate their strength to lead this struggle, we have the confidence to overcome the drought and ensure the smooth completion of this year's patriotic production increase plan for agriculture.

### 集中力量领导群众为战胜旱灾而斗争

    集中力量领导群众为战胜旱灾而斗争
    最近一个多月以来，华北、西北和中南部分地区发生严重旱象。许多地区的大秋作物没有种上，许多地区的麦田夏种没有及时进行，许多地区的浅根作物也因受旱而日趋枯萎。因此，紧急动员起来，开展抗旱斗争，已经成为当前上述地区农村工作中压倒一切的任务。
    早在今年二月八日，中央人民政府政务院就曾发布一项决定，号召大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动。现在，中央人民政府政务院又发布一项紧急指示，号召动员群众开展抗旱斗争。我们必须立即行动起来，响应这个正确适时的号召。
    旱灾对于我国的农业生产是具有重大危害的一种自然灾害。如果认识不足，松懈麻痹，一旦旱灾发生，农业生产就会受到损失，并可能引起疫疠、虫害和牲畜死亡等灾害，进而造成经济建设事业上的困难。这是我们要时刻紧记在心的。
    旱灾是可以战胜的。中国人民在共产党和人民政府领导之下，历年对旱灾进行斗争，不但获得了很大的成绩，而且积累了丰富的经验。经验告诉我们，最重要的关键，就是充分做好思想动员和发动群众的工作，教育群众懂得“人定胜天”的道理，克服群众中的消极情绪和侥幸心理，启发群众的积极性和创造性。只要做到这一点，就能战胜旱灾，保证常年的收成。就在今年已呈旱象的地区，有些地区由于领导机关注意得早，群众抗旱斗争发动得早，就已经获得与旱灾进行斗争的初步成绩。如平原省安阳、新乡两专区，还在麦收时期就开始注意发动群众浇地，做到了上午浇地，下午打场，麦收夏种两不误。
    今年许多地区的夏旱确是很严重的。我们必须动员一切可以动员的力量，来开展抗旱的斗争。我们要办好这样几件事：第一、争取把大秋作物都种上；第二、争取把麦茬地的庄稼都种上；第三、争取把现有庄稼的禾苗都救活。我们的口号就是：“不荒一亩地，不死一颗禾苗！”要办好这几件事，就要组织起来，实行抢种保苗。这就要充分利用一切水源，充分使用一切灌溉设备，广泛推行各种简易的行之有效的灌溉办法，并加强管理，注意节约，把灌水量减到最低限度，以扩大灌溉面积，提高灌溉效能。
    最严重的责任要由各级党的和人民政府的领导机关来担负。在这样有关广大群众生活的问题上，如果漠不关心或松懈麻痹，事先未作准备，事后又束手无策，就是严重的失职，就是犯了严重的官僚主义的错误！只要各级党的和人民政府的领导机关重视这一斗争，集中力量领导这一斗争，我们就有把握战胜旱灾，保证今年农业的爱国增产计划的顺利完成。
