    After the Japanese publishing industry translated Mao Zedong's Selected Works and published them through "Sanichi Shobo," they were warmly welcomed by people of all walks of life in Japan. The first volume of the Selected Works was published in two volumes in Japan. The first Japanese edition of the Selected Works was first published on February 10th, and reprinted on February 20th. Currently, they are rushing to translate the second volume of Mao Zedong's Selected Works published in Beijing. The Japanese people's eagerness to understand the Chinese revolution and study Mao Zedong's Selected Works can be seen from the following facts: In order to cooperate with readers' study of Mao Zedong's Selected Works and strengthen Japanese readers' understanding of the content of the Selected Works, the Japan-China Friendship Association held "China Evenings" in Kyoto and Osaka on April 12th and 14th respectively. Professor Kiyoshi Matsui of Kyoto University, Professor Kakuzo Maeshika of Ritsumeikan University, and Michio Iwamura, director of the China Research Institute, gave lectures on Chinese issues and Mao Zedong's Selected Works. In Osaka alone, more than 4,000 people attended the evening. Since late April, the Japan-China Friendship Association has also been holding regular "Mao Zedong's Selected Works Study Lecture Meetings" in Kyoto and Osaka, with enthusiastic audiences. According to the demands of the vast number of readers, the Japanese "Mao Zedong's Selected Works Publication Association" has also selected and translated papers by Chen Boda and others, and published a "Study Reference Material for Mao Zedong's Selected Works." Now, a wave of studying Mao Zedong's Selected Works has been set off in Japan. (Li Gongchuo)

    毛泽东选集在日本受到热烈欢迎
    捷克斯洛伐克出版“中国共产党的三十年”译本
    毛泽东选集经日本出版界翻译，由“三一书房”出版发行后，日本各阶层人民热烈欢迎。选集第一卷在日本分为两卷刊行，日本版选集第一卷于二月十日发行初版，二月二十日即已再版。现又正在赶译北京出版的毛泽东选集第二卷。日本人民渴望了解中国革命，学习毛泽东选集的热烈情形，从下列事实可以看出：日中友好协会为了配合读者对毛泽东选集的学习，加强日本读者对选集内容的了解，于四月十二、十四两日分别在京都、大阪两地举办了“中国晚会”，由京都大学教授松井清、立命大学教授前芝确三、中国研究所理事岩村三千夫等作了关于中国问题和毛泽东选集的讲演，仅大阪一地出席晚会的群众即达四千余人。自四月下旬起，日中友好协会并在京都、大阪两地举办经常性的定期的“毛泽东选集学习讲演会”，听众异常踊跃。根据广大读者的要求，日本“毛泽东选集刊行会”又选译了陈伯达等的论文，出版了一本“毛泽东选集学习参考资料”。现在，日本已经掀起了一个学习毛泽东选集的热潮。　（李公绰）
