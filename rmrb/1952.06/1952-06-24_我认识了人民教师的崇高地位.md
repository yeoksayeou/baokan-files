To the Editor:

In February 1950, I was admitted to Huanggang Normal School in Hubei. My motive for applying to Huanggang Normal School was impure. I applied to the normal school to "borrow shelter from the rain" because my family was in financial difficulty and I could not attend high school. Therefore, after entering Huanggang Normal School, I was often full of complaints, thinking that "studying at a normal school is tantamount to ruining my bright future and burying my beautiful youth."

In the past, for a period of time, my mind was filled with all sorts of fantasies. Today I wanted to be a writer, tomorrow I wanted to be a combat hero. Becoming a writer or a combat hero is certainly very good, but someone like me, who is fickle and always thinking of myself, cannot become anything.

In March of this year, I went to the affiliated elementary school for teaching practice and deeply felt the loveliness of the children of New China and the greatness of the education profession. I began to feel that living with children is very happy and enjoyable. During my internship, a teacher named Liu Zhenya fell ill, and the students immediately elected representatives to visit him and say, "Teacher, are you feeling better? We really miss you!" What pure and innocent voices! This deeply moved me.

When I wrote the words "Long live" and asked them to make a sentence, they immediately wrote: "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!" At such a young age, they already know how to love their leader. How lovely!

Whether I am lecturing in the classroom or playing games with them on the sports field, they call me affectionately, which makes me deeply feel that the people's teachers of the Mao Zedong era are very worthy of pride and self-esteem. I want to irrigate the flowers of the motherland—the children—with my own blood and sweat, so that our motherland can be built more beautifully. Educational work is of great significance to the construction of the motherland. It is like heavy industry in industry, the master machine in machinery, and it is the fundamental work of national construction. I must eliminate my incorrect thoughts, establish the idea of a career, and fight for the people's education cause to the end.

    我认识了人民教师的崇高地位
    编辑同志：一九五○年二月，我考入湖北黄冈师范学校。我投考黄冈师范学校的动机是不纯的。我是因为家庭经济困难，不能读高中，而投考师范学校来“借屋躲雨”的。因此，我进了黄冈师范学校以后，常常牢骚满腹，认为“读师范学校等于断送自己的光明前途，葬送自己的美丽青春”。
    过去有一段时间我的脑子里是充满着各色各样的幻想的，今天想做一个文学家，明天想当一个战斗英雄。做文学家，当战斗英雄当然也很好，但是像我这样心猿意马，处处为自己打算的人，是什么也当不上的。
    今年三月，我到附属小学试教，深深地感到新中国儿童的可爱，教育专业的伟大。我开始感到和儿童生活在一起是非常幸福愉快的。在我实习时，有
    一位教师刘振亚病倒了，学生当即选出代表去探望他说：“老师，好了没有，我们真想念你呀！”这是多么纯洁天真的声音呀，这使我深深地感动了。
    当我写出“万岁”二字，要他们造句时，他们立刻就这样写：“伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！”小小的心灵就知道热爱自己的领袖，这是多么可爱呀！
    不论我在课堂上讲课或在运动场上和他们一起游戏，他们都亲热地叫唤我，使我深感到毛泽东时代的人民教师是非常值得骄傲和自豪的。我要用我自己的血汗灌溉祖国的花朵——儿童，使我们的祖国建设得更美丽。教育工作对祖国的建设是有着非常重大的意义的，它好比工业中的重工业，机器中的母机，它是国家建设的根本工作。我一定要清除自己不正确的思想，确立事业思想，为人民教育事业奋斗到底。　　　　　唐启初
