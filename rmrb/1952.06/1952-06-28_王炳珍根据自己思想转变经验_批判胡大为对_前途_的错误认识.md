    Wang Bingzhen, Based on his own Experience of Ideological Transformation, Criticizes Hu Dawei's Erroneous Understanding of "Future"

    To the Editor: I have been doing general affairs work for several years now, and I am currently an administrator at the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. When I started doing general affairs work, I was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm. Later, I encountered many obstacles in my work, and I heard some people's incorrect "evaluations" of general affairs work, so I developed the erroneous idea that "doing general affairs work is not promising, has no future, and is inferior to other jobs." This idea once made me uneasy about my work and I requested a change of profession. After the "Three-Anti" movement, with the education of the Party and the help of my comrades, I thoroughly criticized my individualistic thoughts. I am now settled in my work and interested in it. Now, I use my own ideological transformation process to criticize Comrade Hu Dawei's erroneous understanding of not wanting to do general affairs work.

    The issue of "doing general affairs work has no future." What is "future"? On this issue, Hu Dawei's view is incorrect. I used to mistakenly think that "future" meant being promoted by the leadership to some kind of "chief," having fame and status, being able to be high up and command others. Later, I gradually realized that this was a decadent bourgeois individualistic thought. In the revolutionary camp, the individual's future is consistent with the revolutionary future, and the success and victory of the revolution is also one's own success and victory. Comrade Hu Dawei is seeking personal future apart from the interests of the revolution, and this is the mischief of selfish individualistic thoughts.

    Comrade Hu Dawei believes: "If I can have a suitable position, I can definitely do something beneficial for the country." This is also an unrealistic idea. When I first joined the revolution, I was doing tax work. Later, I felt that "tax work often involves contact with businessmen, which is easy to be suspected," so I asked to do education work. After doing education work, I thought that being a teacher was not as good as being a district cadre. Finally, after doing general affairs work, I was still not at ease. Why was I always "looking at the mountain over there while standing on this one"? Because I was considering the problem from the perspective of personal "future" and "desire." As a result, I transferred many jobs, but I didn't do any of them well. Therefore, someone wrote a jingle for me: "Wang Bingzhen has great skills, carrying Marxism-Leninism everywhere, being very strict with others, but having difficulties with himself..." This criticism is very accurate. From this point of view, if Comrade Hu Dawei's individualistic thoughts cannot be overcome, even if he is transferred to another job, it is impossible to do anything beneficial for the revolution. Therefore, Comrade Hu Dawei should thoroughly solve the fundamental problem of the relationship between the individual and the revolution, and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. Only in this way can the problem of uneasiness at work be solved.

    王炳珍根据自己思想转变经验
    批判胡大为对“前途”的错误认识
    编辑同志：我做总务工作已经好几年了，现在在中华全国总工会华北工作委员会当管理员。我开始做总务工作的时候，抱着满腔的革命热情；后来在工作上碰了许多钉子，又听到某些人对总务工作不正确的“评价”，于是就产生了“做总务工作没出息、没前途，比其他工作低一等”的错误思想。这种思想一度使我不安心工作，而要求改行。经过“三反”运动，在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，我彻底地批判了自己的个人主义思想。我的工作安心了，对工作也有兴趣了。现在我以自己的思想转变过程，来批判胡大为同志不愿意做总务工作的错误认识。
    “做总务工作没有前途”问题。什么是“前途”呢？在这个问题上，胡大为的看法是不对的。我过去曾错误地认为“前途”就是领导上把自己提拔成一个什么“长”，有名誉，有地位，可以高高在上，指挥别人。后来，我逐渐认识了这是一种腐朽的资产阶级的个人主义思想。在革命阵营中，个人前途和革命前途是一致的，革命的成功和胜利，也就是自己的成功和胜利。胡大为同志脱离了革命的利益来寻求个人的前途，这是自私自利的个人主义思想在作祟。
    胡大为同志认为：“我如果能有一个适合的岗位，一定可以为国家干些有益的事。”这也是不现实的想法。我刚参加革命的时候，是做税务工作。后来觉得“税务工作经常和商人接触，容易被人怀疑”，就要求做教育工作。做了教育工作以后，又认为当教员不如当区干部好。最后做了总务工作，还是不安心。为什么我总是“这山望着那山高”呢？因为我是从个人“前途”和“愿望”出发来考虑问题。结果，调动了很多工作，但什么工作都没有做好。因此，有人给我编了个顺口溜：“王炳珍本领高，背着马列主义遍地跑，对待别人很严格，对待自己就困难了……”这个批评是很对的。由此看来，如果胡大为同志的个人主义思想不能克服，就是给他调换一个工作，也不可能为革命作什么有益的事。因此，胡大为同志应该彻底解决个人和革命的关系这个根本问题，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。只有这样，才能解决不安心工作的问题。王炳珍
