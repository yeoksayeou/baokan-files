    Supplementary Explanation Regarding Factories and Mines Preparing to Assist Students with Summer Internships
    Comrade Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Shen Liang'an on May 7th, "Suggestions for Factories and Enterprises to Actively Prepare to Assist Students with Summer Internships." This suggestion is good. However, a few days ago, Tianjin University announced a notice from the Ministry of Education, the gist of which is: "This year, because schools are carrying out the 'Three-Anti's' movement, students' studies have been affected to some extent. To give students the opportunity to make up for their studies, it has been decided to postpone the summer vacation by one month. This semester will be extended to early August for vacation, and the next semester will be extended to late September for the start of school. Therefore, summer internships in factories and mines for students of science and engineering colleges will be suspended for one year." According to this notice, a supplementary explanation must be made: Factories and mines do not need to expend manpower and resources to engage in preparations to assist students with summer internships this year.
                                    Su Liang
    Editor's Note: Reader Su Liang's opinion is very important. We hope all factories and mines will take note.

### 对各厂矿应准备帮助学生进行暑期实习的补充说明

    对各厂矿应准备帮助学生进行暑期实习的补充说明
    编辑同志：人民日报五月七日刊载了读者沈亮庵“建议各厂矿、企业应积极准备帮助学生进行暑期实习”一信。这个建议是好的。但是前几天，我们天津大学公布教育部的通知，大意是：“今年因为学校进行‘三反’运动，同学们在学业上受到一定的影响。为使同学们有机会补习，决定今年暑假期改迟一个月，本学期延至八月初放假，下学期延至九月底开学。理工学院同学暑期工厂、矿山实习，因此暂停一年。”根据这个通知，就必须作一个补充说明：各工厂、矿山今年不必再拿出人力、物力来从事帮助学生暑期实习的准备工作。
                                    苏亮
    编者按：读者苏亮的意见很重要，希望各工厂、矿山注意。
