Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: Due to the U.S. side's unilateral interruption of the Korean armistice negotiations and refusal to attend the meeting, the plenary session of the delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations still failed to be held on the 9th. At 1:00 p.m. on the 9th, our liaison officer, acting on the order of the chief representative, notified the other side: The other side's continuous refusal to attend the meeting for two consecutive days clearly shows a deliberate attempt to sabotage the armistice negotiations, and there is no reason whatsoever. The other side cannot defend its unilateral and unreasonable plan to detain prisoners of war at the meeting, nor can it oppose our fair and reasonable plan to repatriate prisoners of war to their homes, but attempts to achieve its goal of detaining prisoners of war by means of a unilateral recess. However, this rude and provocative behavior of the other side can only expose its conspiracy to deliberately sabotage the armistice negotiations, and cannot achieve any other purpose. Our side insists on the normal progress of the meeting and demands that the other side come to the meeting at 11:00 a.m. on the 10th.

At 5:00 p.m. on the 9th, our chief liaison officer, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, met with the other side's chief liaison officer, Senior Colonel Kinney, in Panmunjom. Senior Colonel Zhang handed over a letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to General Clark (see separate dispatch) to Senior Colonel Kinney for forwarding.

    我方联络官奉命继续通知美方前来开会
    【新华社开城九日电】由于美方片面中断朝鲜停战谈判，拒不出席会议，朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会在九日仍然未能举行。九日下午一时，我方联络官奉首席代表之命通知对方：对方连续两天拒绝前来开会，显系蓄意破坏停战谈判，没有任何理由。对方在会上无法辩护其片面无理的扣留战俘的方案，无法反对我方公平合理的遣返战俘回家的方案，却企图以片面休会的方式来达到其扣留战俘的目的。但对方这种无礼挑衅行为，只能暴露其蓄意破坏停战谈判的阴谋，而不能达到任何其他目的。我方坚持会议正常进行，要求对方在十日上午十一时前来开会。
    九日下午五时，我方首席联络官张春山上校与对方首席联络官肯尼上校在板门店会晤，张上校将我方金日成和彭德怀两将军致克拉克将军公函一件（见另电）交给肯尼上校转去。
