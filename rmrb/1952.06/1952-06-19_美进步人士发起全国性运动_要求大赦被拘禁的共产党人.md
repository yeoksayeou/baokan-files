    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: TASS, New York, June 17th: American progressive labor unions and other organizations have launched a national movement demanding amnesty for Communists and other progressive leaders who have been arrested and convicted under the reactionary Smith Act.
    "The Worker" reported that representatives from various states held a congress in New York to launch this movement and elected a standing committee to organize amnesty activities.
    The congress was chaired by Professor Frank, a famous American lawyer. He delivered a speech at the close of the congress, saying, "It is something that makes me feel proud to be here with you all, not hiding behind the front line of this struggle for freedom." Frank is currently prosecuting the authorities for convicting Meyers, chairman of the Baltimore, Maryland branch of the Communist Party, and five other victims of the Smith Act.
    Jackson, a black leader and staff member of the progressive Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers union, also spoke at the congress, saying, "I come before you to pledge to force the prison gates open and restore the freedom of these working-class political leaders."
    Also speaking at the meeting were the famous writer Fast, surgeon Barsky, and writer Aptheker.

    美进步人士发起全国性运动
    要求大赦被拘禁的共产党人
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：美国进步工会和其他组织发起了要求赦免根据反动的史密斯法而被逮捕和判罪的共产党人和其他进步领袖的一个全国性的运动。
    “工人日报”报道：各州的代表们在纽约举行了发起这个运动的大会，并且选出了一个常设委员会来组织要求大赦的活动。
    大会由美国著名律师法朗斯教授担任主席。他在大会闭幕时发表演说称：“我能够在这里和你们大家在一起，而不躲藏在这一场为自由而斗争的战线的后方，这是使我感觉自豪的事情。”法朗斯目前正在控诉当局将马里兰州巴尔的摩地方的共产党主席梅尔斯和其他五名史密斯法受难者判罪的行为。
    黑人领袖和进步的开采冶炼工人工会的工作人员杰克逊也在大会上发言说：“我来到你们的面前，保证要促使狱门打开，使这些工人阶级的政治领袖们恢复自由。”
    在会上发言的还有著名作家法斯特、外科医生巴尔斯基、作家阿普脱克等人。
