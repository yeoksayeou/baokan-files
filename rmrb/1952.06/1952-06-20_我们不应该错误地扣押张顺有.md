    We Should Not Have Wrongfully Detained Zhang Shunyou
    Yanggao County Public Security Bureau, Chahar Province

    Due to our poor bureaucratic work style, on November 11, 1951, we made the mistake of detaining cart driver Zhang Shunyou along with the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude. We also failed to earnestly resolve the issue of Song's deduction of Zhang Shunyou's wages. The facts are as follows: On September 17, 1951, Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver from Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, took a letter of introduction from the Fourth District People's Government of our county to the court to accuse the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude. The court president, Zheng Guang, endorsed the letter of introduction to the Public Security Bureau. Zhang Shunyou went to the execution section of the Public Security Bureau and verbally accused Song of his crimes, requesting a letter of introduction to go to Suiyuan to arrest Song. At that time, Wang Tingshi, a staff member of the execution section, replied to Zhang Shunyou: You don't need to go; we can write a letter to Gui Sui to arrest Song. However, after Zhang Shunyou left, we never sent a letter to Gui Sui.

    On November 10, the Gui Sui Public Security Bureau sent Song and Zhang Shunyou back to the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau. At that time, Wu Xiang, a warden in the detention center, without asking any questions, ordered the guards to send the worker Zhang Shunyou and Song to the court detention center and detained them for two hours. Later, it was discovered that the detention of Zhang Shunyou was a mistake, and he was released.

    Our illegal detention of Zhang Shunyou was a serious violation of human rights and a serious dereliction of duty. The reason for this error is mainly our serious bureaucratic work style. When Zhang Shunyou first came to the Public Security Bureau to make accusations, the leadership was completely unaware. When Zhang Shunyou was detained by Wu Xiang, the warden, the leadership was still unaware. Later, the director discovered the matter, but still did not take it seriously. This serious bureaucratic work style is intolerable. Second, we have not paid close attention to the study of cadres on a regular basis, and policy education is very poor. There is a serious lack of organization and discipline among the cadres. When Zhang Shunyou was detained, the warden Wu Xiang did not discuss it with the section chief. After Song's case was closed, the section chief did not report to the director, and the director did not check. It was not until a letter from Shanxi Province inquired about the detention of Zhang Shunyou that the problem was found to be serious. However, the director still did not report to the higher party committee and government. This is also the main reason for this error. Third, the work system is not strict, and a scientific and regular work system and handover procedures have not been established. This has also fueled the lack of organization and discipline among the cadres.

    The incident in which Zhang Shunyou's report of a counter-revolutionary element was obstructed is of great educational significance to us. Accepting the lessons of this incident, in the future, first, in addition to making a public self-criticism in the newspaper, we will also launch a discussion among all personnel of the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly examine the bureaucratic work style and ensure that we resolutely implement the "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People's Work" of the State Council of the Central People's Government.

    Second, establish a scientific and regular work system and handover procedures, and strictly abide by them. When section members encounter problems in their work, they should consult with the section chief at any time. When section chiefs encounter problems in their work, they should report to the director or secretary at any time. The secretary should report the daily situation to the director. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the working relationship between various sections.

    Third, strengthen the political and theoretical study of cadres, and enable every cadre to establish the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    In addition, we have sent Zhang Zhiying, the investigation section chief, and Wang Shangzhi, the court president, to Gui Sui City to investigate the issue of Song Yude's deduction of Zhang Shunyou's wages, and we guarantee to recover them. We will be responsible for compensating Zhang Shunyou for the travel expenses he spent on reporting Song's crimes. Finally, we apologize to worker Zhang Shunyou and sincerely accept the punishment given to us by the higher authorities.

    我们不应该错误地扣押张顺有
    察哈尔省阳高县人民政府公安局
    由于我们有恶劣的官僚主义作风，在一九五一年十一月十一日发生了把赶车工人张顺有和反革命分子宋郁德一同押入监所的错误。对宋犯克扣张顺有工资的问题，也没有给予认真的解决。事实经过是：山西崞县赶车工人张顺有在一九五一年九月十七日拿着我县四区人民政府的介绍信，到法院控诉反革命分子宋郁德。法院院长郑广把介绍信批到公安局。张顺有到公安局执行股口诉了宋犯的罪恶，要求开介绍信到绥远去逮捕宋犯。当时执行股股员王廷仕答复张顺有说：你不用去了，我们可以给你往归绥写信扣捕宋犯。但张顺有走后，我们根本没有给归绥去过信。
    十一月十日，归绥市公安局派人把宋犯和张顺有一并送回阳高县公安局。当时看守所干事武祥不问青红皂白，就叫看守员把工人张顺有和宋犯一同送到法院看守所押了两个钟头，后来发觉扣押张顺有是错误的，才把他放出来。
    我们非法扣押张顺有，是严重的侵犯人权的行为，严重的失职行为。发生这种错误的原因，主要是我们存在着严重的官僚主义作风。张顺有第一次来公安局控诉时，领导方面根本不知道；张顺有被看守所干事武祥扣押时，领导方面仍不知道；后来局长发觉了这件事，但仍未认真处理。这种严重的官僚主义作风，实在不能容忍。第二，平时对干部的学习抓得不紧，政策教育很差，干部中有着严重的无组织无纪律现象。扣押张顺有时，干事武祥并没有和股长研究。宋犯结案后，股长也没有向局长报告，而局长也没有检查。当山西省来信追问扣押张顺有的情形时，才发现问题是严重了。但局长仍没有向上级党委和政府汇报。这也是这次产生错误的主要原因。第三，工作制度不严密，没有建立起科学的、正规的工作制度和接交手续。这也助长了干部中的无组织无纪律行为。
    张顺有检举反革命分子受到阻难的事件，对我们的教育意义非常重大。接受这一事件的教训，今后，第一，我们除在报纸上作公开检讨外，并要在公安局全体人员中展开讨论，彻底检查官僚主义作风，保证今后坚决执行中央人民政府政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”。
    第二，建立科学的、正规的工作制度和接交手续，并严格遵守。股员在工作中遇到问题时，要随时和股长研究；股长在工作中遇到问题时，要随时向局长或秘书汇报。秘书要把每日情况向局长汇报。同时，要加强各股间的工作联系。
    第三，加强干部的政治、理论学习，要使每一个干部树立起全心全意为人民服务的观念。
    另外，对宋犯郁德克扣张顺有工资的问题，我们已派调查股长张志英协同法院院长王尚志到归绥市调查，保证追还；对张顺有检举宋犯所花去的路费，我们一定负责补偿。最后，我们向工人张顺有道歉，并诚恳地接受上级给我们的处分。
