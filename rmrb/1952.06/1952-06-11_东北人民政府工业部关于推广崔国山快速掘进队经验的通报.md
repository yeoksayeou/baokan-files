Notice from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government on Popularizing the Experience of the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team

    (1)
    In the past two years, due to insufficient attention paid to tunneling work by some leading cadres in the coal mining industry, the tunneling work in many mines has often failed to be completed according to plan. As a result, the progress of tunneling has lagged far behind the needs of production development, and even hindered further improvement in production. Therefore, how to use the most effective methods in the shortest period of time to make the tunneling progress catch up with and exceed the requirements of production increase has become an important task in carrying out the production increase and conservation movement in the coal mining industry.
    The way to accomplish this task, in addition to carefully adjusting the tunneling plan to ensure that it truly meets the needs of production, and appropriately reducing unnecessary or less urgent raises and entries based on the actual situation in order to concentrate efforts on tunneling the main roadways, is to vigorously organize and promote rapid tunneling methods and implement mechanized tunneling operations.

    (2)
    In accelerating roadway tunneling, the advanced producer in the coal mining industry—the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team of the Jixi Mining Bureau—has created excellent achievements and extremely valuable advanced experience. These achievements and experiences point out the path for us to complete the tunneling task. The Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team was established in October 1951, with a total of 67 members, using Soviet loaders to carry out tunneling in double-track roadways (tunneling both the raises and entries of the same roadway simultaneously). In October 1951, the average daily progress was 26 meters; in December, the average daily progress increased to 27 meters; and in March of this year, the daily progress was further increased to over 40 meters. The average daily labor productivity of tunneling workers increased to 0.4 meters.
    The achievements of the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team are much better than those of general tunneling groups (with about 10 people); their labor efficiency is twice as high as that of general tunneling groups (general tunneling groups advance 0.2 meters per work day); their explosive consumption is 40 percent lower than that of general tunneling groups, and their detonator consumption is 45 percent less; therefore, their cost of tunneling one meter is 40 percent lower than that of general tunneling groups.
    The main reasons why the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team was able to create these excellent achievements are:
    First, the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team improved the past labor organization by centering on the loader, implemented a division of labor and responsibility system, closely coordinated various types of work, implemented division of labor and cooperation, and made full use of working time to carry out work rhythmically. Therefore, they can drill more holes and blast more frequently. They can drill three rounds of holes and blast three times in each shift, and sometimes they can blast four times. This speeds up the progress of tunneling. In general tunneling groups, due to unreasonable labor organization, they can generally only blast once in a shift.
    Second, the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team mainly focuses on level roadway tunneling, and carries out raise and entry tunneling at the same time as level roadway tunneling. This changes the past operating methods and tunnels three roadways simultaneously; this makes it easier to organize drilling and blasting, give full play to the loader's capabilities, and rationally use labor, which makes it possible to speed up the tunneling.
    Third, another important reason for the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team's faster daily progress is that they have implemented mechanized tunneling and given full play to the effectiveness of the loader. However, many mining bureaus under the Coal Mining Administration have not yet utilized loaders, and this situation must be changed.
    Fourth, the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team, due to its emphasis on political work and earnest strengthening of the education of employees and technicians, has greatly stimulated the creativity and enthusiasm of workers and technicians, and has continuously researched and improved technical operations and technical procedures, so that the tunneling speed is increasing month by month.

    (3)
    The important significance of the experience created by the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team lies in the fact that it points out to all coal mine employees the methods to accelerate tunneling progress and improve labor productivity. If this advanced experience is earnestly promoted and made a weapon that can be mastered by the majority of employees, it will generally improve the labor productivity of tunneling and give the tunneling work a new look. Therefore, leading cadres and engineering technicians at all levels of the coal mining industry should carefully study the advanced experience of Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling and strive to make up for the previously uncompleted tunneling tasks as soon as possible. It is required that each mining bureau cultivate and create two to five Cui Guoshan-style rapid tunneling teams before the third quarter of this year, in order to improve the level of the entire tunneling work by one step.

    (4)
    In the tunneling work of all ferrous and non-ferrous metal mines, and in the tunneling projects of various mine constructions, the experience of Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method should be vigorously promoted in light of the actual conditions of the unit, in order to make the tunneling work meet the needs of production development and accelerate the speed of mine construction.

### 东北人民政府工业部关于推广崔国山快速掘进队经验的通报

    东北人民政府工业部关于推广崔国山快速掘进队经验的通报
    （一）
    近两年来，由于煤矿工业部门部分领导干部对掘进工作重视不够，不少矿山的掘进工作经常不能按计划完成，结果使掘进的进度远远落后于生产发展的需要，甚至阻碍着生产进一步的提高。因此，如何在最短期间内，用最有效的方法，使掘进进度赶上而且超过产量增涨的要求，已成为在煤矿工业中开展增产节约运动的一个重要任务。
    完成这一任务的方法，除周密地调整掘进计划，使其确实符合于生产的需要，并根据实际情况，适当地减少不必要或不太急需的上山和顺槽，以便集中力量掘进主要的巷道之外，必须用大力组织和推行快速掘进法，并实行掘进的机械化作业。
    （二）
    在加速巷道掘进中，煤矿工业的先进生产者——鸡西矿务局崔国山快速掘进队已经创造了优良的成绩和极其宝贵的先进经验。这些成绩和经验给我们指出了完成掘进任务的道路。崔国山快速掘进队成立于一九五一年十月，全队六十七人，使用苏联装煤机，在双轨巷道里实行掘进（同时掘进同一巷道的上山和顺槽）。在一九五一年十月份日平均进度是二十六公尺，十二月日平均进度提高到二十七公尺；在今年三月份，更把日进度提高到四十公尺以上。掘进工人的日平均劳动生产率提高到零点四公尺。
    崔国山快速掘进队的成绩比一般的掘进组（人数约十人左右）优异得多；他们的劳动效率比一般掘进组提高了一倍（一般掘进组一工日进零点二公尺）；他们在火药消耗上比一般掘进组低百分之四十，在雷管消耗上少百分之四十五；因此，他们掘进一公尺的成本比一般掘进组低百分之四十。
    崔国山快速掘进队所以能创造出这些优良成绩，其原因主要是：
    第一，崔国山快速掘进队以装煤机为中心，改善了过去的劳动组织，实行了分工专责制，密切了各种工种之间的配合，实行分工协作，充分地利用了工作时间，有节奏地进行工作，因此能够多打眼多放炮。他们每一班内能打三遍眼，放三遍炮，有时可以放四遍炮。这就加快了掘进的进度。而一般的掘进小组，由于劳动组织不合理，一般地只能在一班中放一次炮。
    第二，崔国山快速掘进队是以平巷掘进为主要作业场所，在平巷掘进的同时，并进行上山和顺槽掘进，这就改变了过去的作业方法，在三个巷道同时掘进；这就更加便于组织打眼放炮，发挥装煤机的能力，合理使用劳动力，因而也就可能加快掘进的速度。
    第三，崔国山快速掘进队每日进度较快的另一个重要原因，是他们实行了掘进机械化，充分发挥了装煤机的效能。但目前煤矿管理局所属的矿务局，有不少的装煤机还没有加以利用，这种情况必须改变。
    第四，崔国山快速掘进队，由于重视政治工作，认真加强职工与技术人员的教育，因而工人与技术人员的创造性与积极性大大发挥，不断地研究与改善技术操作，改善技术工艺程序，使掘进的速度月月在提高。
    （三）
    崔国山快速掘进队所创造的经验的重要意义，就在于它给全体煤矿职工指出了加速掘进进度和提高劳动生产率的方法。如把这一先进经验加以认真地推广，使其成为多数职工都能掌握的武器，就能普遍地提高掘进的劳动生产率，使掘进工作面貌一新。因此，煤矿工业的各级领导干部和工程技术人员，都应该认真研究崔国山快速掘进的先进经验，争取尽早地补上以前未完成的掘进任务。要求各矿务局在今年第三季度以前，各培养与创造两个至五个崔国山式的快速掘进队，以便把整个掘进工作的水平提高一步。
    （四）
    在所有黑色金属及有色金属矿山的掘进工作上，在各个矿井建设的掘进工程上，都应当根据崔国山快速掘进法的经验，结合本单位的实际情况，大力地加以推广，以便使掘进工作满足生产发展的需要与加快矿井建设的速度。
