Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 27th: Unable to force our side to accept its barbaric and unreasonable proposals at the negotiating table, the American aggressors are attempting to achieve their despicable goals through military pressure. After the failure of a series of U.S. military offensives on the front lines, the U.S. Air Force barbarically bombed hydroelectric power stations in the rear of Korea on the 23rd. This serious provocative incident is part of the U.S.'s so-called "tough policy."

While U.S. officials publicly deny that this new provocation "contains any political significance," they are trying their best to promote the "political significance" of this bombing through so-called government officials and foreign news agencies. The most typical example of this is the conversation with "a defense official." According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 23rd, this official said: "This large-scale bombing of power plants on the Yalu River is the result of the stalemate in the Korean armistice negotiations in Panmunjom." He added: "We now realize that the best way to break the deadlock in Panmunjom is to use all our strength to strike the enemy." A Washington dispatch from United Press on the 24th revealed the words of "U.S. officials," who made even more unscrupulous threats and intimidations. These officials said that they intend to use "a lot" of this military pressure. They said that they will continue to bomb these power stations "until the Chinese and North Korean negotiators accept the 'final' armistice proposal of the United Nations forces."

In addition to this, the American aggressors are also attempting to use this provocative incident to create a tense atmosphere in the United States and create conditions for continuing to expand armaments and prepare for war. A dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Washington on the 24th revealed that Washington pointed out: "Showing power like bombing facilities on the Yalu River may rekindle the enthusiasm of the American people for the Korean War."

Observers here pointed out that the U.S. plan to forcibly detain our 100,000 prisoners of war is extremely unreasonable and completely violates the Geneva Convention, and therefore is absolutely unacceptable. Since the U.S. cannot get at the negotiating table what they cannot get in military offensives, they certainly should not even think about using the bankrupt military pressure to get what they cannot get at the negotiating table. The great Korean and Chinese people have demonstrated indestructible strength in the two years of the anti-aggression war, beating the once invincible American imperialism so that it can only sit down and negotiate. They will never be intimidated by any military pressure. For its own unspeakable and despicable purposes, American imperialism is conspiring to use various shameless means and barbaric acts to undermine the armistice negotiations. At the same time, it continues its rude and provocative acts of interrupting negotiations and regularly evading meetings. This is the cowardly face of the outwardly strong but inwardly weak American aggressor. Unless the U.S. publicly announces the breakdown of the negotiations, our side will continue to resolutely fight to realize our fair and reasonable proposals. Any barbaric provocation by the U.S. will not only fail to change our firm position in the slightest, but will inevitably swallow the serious consequences arising therefrom.

### 美方妄图用军事压力迫使我接受无理方案

    美方妄图用军事压力迫使我接受无理方案
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美国侵略者无法在谈判桌上迫使我方接受其蛮横无理的方案，就企图用军事压力来达到其卑鄙的目的。在美军对前线的一连串进攻遭到失败以后，美国空军二十三日野蛮地轰炸了朝鲜后方的水电站。这一严重的挑衅事件就是美方这种所谓“强硬政策”的一部分。
    美国官方一方面矢口否认这次新挑衅“含有任何政治意义”，一方面却通过所谓政府官员以及外国通讯社极力宣传这次轰炸的“政治意义”。在这方面，最典型的是“一位国防官员”的谈话。据美联社华盛顿二十三日电称，这位官员说：“这次对于鸭绿江上发电厂的大轰炸是由于板门店朝鲜停战谈判停滞不前的后果。”他又说：“现在我们认识到，打破板门店僵局的最好的办法，无过于用我们所有的力量来给敌人以打击。”合众社华盛顿二十四日电透露的“美国官员们”的话，更肆无忌惮地进行了威胁和恫吓。这些官员们说，他们打算使用“不少”这种军事压力。他们说，他们将继续轰炸这些发电站，“直到中国和北朝鲜谈判代表接受联合国军的‘最后’停战建议为止”。
    除此而外，美国侵略者还企图用这种挑衅事件来在美国国内制造紧张气氛，为继续进行扩军备战制造条件。法新社华盛顿二十四日电透露，华盛顿方面指出：“像轰炸鸭绿江上设备那样显示威力，可能重新鼓起美国群众对于朝鲜战争的热情。”
    此间观察家指出，美方强迫扣留我方十万战俘的方案是极端无理的，完全破坏日内瓦公约的，因而也是绝对不能接受的。美方既然不能在谈判桌上得到他们在军事进攻中所不能得到的东西，他们当然更不要想用早经破产了的军事压力来得到他们在谈判桌上所不能得到的东西。伟大的朝中人民已经在两年的反侵略战争中显示了不可摧毁的力量，把曾经不可一世的美帝国主义打得只能坐下来进行谈判，他们决不是任何军事压力所能吓倒的。美帝国主义为了不可告人的卑鄙目的，阴谋用各种无耻手段和野蛮行为来破坏停战谈判，同时，又继续其中断谈判、定期逃会的无礼的挑衅举动，这就是外强中干、色厉内荏的美国侵略者的卑怯面目。除非美方公开宣布谈判破裂，我方将继续坚决为实现我方公平合理的方案而进行斗争，美方的任何野蛮挑衅行为都不但不能丝毫改变我方的坚定立场，而且必将自食其由此而产生的严重后果。
