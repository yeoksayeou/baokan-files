Chongqing State-Owned No. 101 Factory Steelmaking Shop
Sets National Smelting Record with 402 Heats
    The Chongqing State-Owned No. 101 Factory's steelmaking shop set a new national smelting record of 402 heats. The No. 1 open-hearth furnace of the factory began producing the first heat of the 32nd round of steel on January 24th of this year. Due to the application of the Kovalev method by all employees during the smelting process, along with cross-patching and charging, the smelting time was greatly reduced. Previously, after each heat of steel was produced, patching and charging would take one and a half to two hours. At the same time, charging after tapping reduced the furnace temperature, which prolonged the smelting time. Now, each charging takes only 45 minutes, and the patching time has been reduced by an average of 20 minutes. Based on the time saved on patching alone, the country saves 380 million yuan each month. While learning and applying the Kovalev method, the shop's workers also implemented technical quotas and the Soviet shift system, allowing three-shift workers to rotate one day off per week. This not only protects the health of the workers but also improves production efficiency. Due to the application of these advanced experiences, the No. 1 open-hearth furnace broke the record of 333 heats on the afternoon of May 18th, while also increasing production by 9.83% compared to last year, reducing defective products by 81.55%, reducing scrap by 64.16%, and shortening the smelting time by 10.77%, while the furnace remains normal. This further increased the workers' enthusiasm, and the entire shop shouted the slogan "March towards 400 heats!" as a gift to the Party's birthday. By 2:25 AM on June 15th, the shop had created an unprecedented new record of 402 heats. After the news of the entire steelmaking shop's creation of a new record spread, the factory's Party committee, administration, trade union, and Youth League each wrote letters congratulating all employees of the steelmaking shop on their great victory on the production front!

    重庆国营一○一厂炼钢场
    创四○二炉的全国冶炼新纪录
    重庆国营一○一厂炼钢场创四○二炉的全国冶炼新纪录。该厂一号平炉自今年一月二十四日开始出三十二届第一炉钢。由于全体职工在冶炼过程中运用了郭瓦廖夫工作法，交叉补炉进料，大大缩短了冶炼时间。以前每出一炉钢之后，再补炉进料，时间要一个半小时到两小时；同时，出钢后再进料，炉内温度已降低，又拖长了冶炼时间。现在每炉进料时间只需四十五分钟，补炉时间也平均缩短二十分钟，单以补炉节省的时间计算，每月就替国家节省了三亿八千万元。在学习和运用郭瓦廖夫工作法的同时，该场工人又实行了技术定额和苏联的轮休制度，使三班制的工人，每星期轮流休息一天。这样不但保护了工人的健康，又提高了生产效率。由于运用了这些先进经验，五月十八日下午该号平炉便突破了三百三十三炉的纪录，同时比去年产量提高了百分之九点八三；次品降低了百分之八一点五五；废品降低了百分之六四点一六；冶炼时间缩短了百分之十点七七；而炉子仍无异样。因此更增加了工人们的劳动热情，全场喊出“向四百炉前进！”的口号，作为对党的生日的献礼。到六月十五日早晨二时二十五分为止，该场创造了四○二炉的空前新纪录。炼钢场全体职工创造新纪录的消息传出以后，该厂党、行政、工会、青年团分别写信向炼钢场全体职工祝贺他们在生产战线上的伟大胜利！
