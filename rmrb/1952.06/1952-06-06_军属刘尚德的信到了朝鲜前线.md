    Military Family Member Liu Shangde's Letter Arrives at the Korean Front

    A letter written by Liu Shangde, a military family member, to his son, Liu Guangzi, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, was broadcast from the air to the Korean front on the evening of May 13th. The letter was received by commanders of Liu Guangzi's unit while listening to a broadcast from the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. Liu Guangzi had previously captured sixty-three soldiers from the British mercenary army's 29th Brigade in a single action on the front lines of Mount Komak, earning him a first-class merit. On April 23rd, the Anti-American Aid-Korea Branch of the Shanba District of Suiyuan Province, Liu Guangzi's hometown, held a celebration rally for him in Shanba Town with 20,000 people. In the letter, Liu Shangde described the grand scale of the rally. As the announcer read the letter in a warm tone, the commanders' faces frequently lit up with joyful smiles.

    The next morning, the commanders sent someone to deliver the recorded letter to Liu Guangzi's company. The news of the celebration rally held in Liu Guangzi's hometown immediately spread throughout the company. Soldiers came to congratulate Liu Guangzi, joyfully lifting him up and tossing him into the air. The political instructor was surrounded by the soldiers and stood on a stage in the combat zone clubhouse, reading the letter aloud twice. But everyone was not satisfied, so they asked the cultural instructor and clerk to read it twice more.

    When it was read that at the rally, "Many people spoke, saying that they wanted to learn from you and unite to carry out the patriotic production increase movement to support the Volunteers. A primary school student said: I must learn from the spirit of Uncle Liu Guangzi, study hard, exercise, and become a hero to defend the motherland in the future," enthusiastic applause and slogans erupted from the audience.

    When it continued to be read that "After the rally, your brother Guangqian, your sister Jinjin, and your wife rode horses, wearing red flowers, and paraded through the streets. The streets were filled with crowds welcoming us. The next day, when we returned to the village, more than 5,000 representatives from the county and villagers from nearby were lined up to welcome us. The villagers said: We will use patriotic production increases to celebrate Liu Guangzi's meritorious service. On the spot, eight mutual aid teams launched a challenge for a bumper harvest competition to the whole county," enthusiastic applause and slogans erupted from the audience again.

    Liu Guangzi was also listening happily from the audience while the letter was read. As soon as the letter was finished, he was embraced onto the stage amidst cheers and applause from the soldiers, the medal on his chest shining brightly, his face flushed red. He said excitedly: "This is not only my personal honor, but also the honor of the people of the motherland to our entire army. This is the result of the education of the Party and the superiors, glory to the Party and Chairman Mao! I must redouble my efforts and strive for greater victories to repay the love and hope of the people of the motherland to us." Then many soldiers, encouraged by the lofty honor, scrambled to the stage to express their determination to perform meritorious deeds. Their attitude was as solemn as when they held the oath-taking rally before the expedition. Zhang Fengjun, a new soldier who had been led by Liu Guangzi, said at the meeting: "Liu Guangzi's heroic spirit has encouraged me, and I have also performed meritorious service. In the future, I will continue to improve my tactical skills and strive for greater glory!"

    At noon, representatives sent by soldiers from various fraternal companies came to congratulate Liu Guangzi with flowers and drums. They carried Liu Guangzi out of the shelter, put flowers on him, performed clapper talk and the yangko dance in front of him. A joyous scene of heroes appeared on the hillside.

    This news, like a victory bulletin, quickly spread to the forefront of the front. That night, representatives sent by the soldiers on the forward positions came to congratulate Liu Guangzi through the enemy's artillery blockade zone. They said: "The glory of Comrade Liu Guangzi is also our glory. The instructions of Father Liu that he should work harder to kill the enemy are also the instructions of the people of the motherland to us. We must hold our positions and kill more enemies to repay the love of the people of the motherland to us!" The "Great Merit Company" where Liu Guangzi used to be also sent representatives to congratulate him, and promised to carry forward the honor and create more heroes like him.

    Liu Shangde's family letter spread from one position to another, encouraging the fighting spirit of the soldiers to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds. Liu Guangzi himself also wrote a letter to General Peng Dehuai, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, expressing his determination to bravely kill the enemy and strive for greater honor. He also wrote a reply to his father. The letter said: "My comrades and I are killing more enemies at the front, and you and the villagers are working hard to increase production in the rear. Let us work together to strive for an early victory in the war to resist America and aid Korea!"

    军属刘尚德的信到了朝鲜前线
    新华社记者　曾思明
    军属刘尚德写给儿子——志愿军英雄刘光子的一封信，在五月十三日晚上从空中传到了朝鲜前线。这封信是刘光子所在部队的指挥员们在收听北京中央人民广播电台的广播时收听到的。刘光子曾在绀岳山前线一次活捉了六十三个英国帮凶军第二十九旅的士兵，因而立了一等功。刘光子的家乡——绥远省陕坝专区的抗美援朝分会，四月二十三日在陕坝镇为他开了一个两万人的庆功大会。刘尚德在信中述说了这个大会的盛况。当播音员用亲切的口吻读着这封信的时候，指挥员脸上不时地露出愉快的笑容。
    第二天一早，指挥员派人将记录下来的信送到了刘光子所在的连队，刘光子家乡给他开庆功大会的消息立即在连队里传开了。战士们纷纷前来向刘光子道喜，高兴得将他抬起来抛到空中。政治指导员被战士们簇拥到战地俱乐部，站在台上高声地将信念了两遍。但大家听得还不满足，又请文化教员和文书念了两遍。
    当念到大会上“有许多人讲话，他们都说要向你学习，要一致起来开展爱国增产运动，支援志愿军。一个小学生说：我一定要学习刘光子叔叔的精神，努力学习、锻炼身体，将来作一个保卫祖国的英雄。”的时候，台下就响起了热烈的掌声和口号声。
    当继续读到“大会后，我和你弟弟光前，你妹妹金金和你妻子，骑着马、戴着红花，在大街上游行。满街人山人海欢迎我们。第二天回家。到村时，全县代表和附近的老乡五千多人排着队欢迎我们。老乡说：要用爱国增产来给刘光子庆功。当场就有八个互助组向全县发起丰产竞赛挑战。”的时候，台下又响起了热烈的掌声和口号声。
    念信时，刘光子也在台下喜孜孜地听着。信一念完，他就在战士们的欢呼声和鼓掌声中被拥上讲台，胸前的奖章闪着光亮，脸孔涨得红红的。他激动地说：“这不只是我个人的光荣，也是祖国人民给我们全军的光荣。这是党和上级教育我的结果，光荣归于党和毛主席！我一定要加倍努力，争取更大的胜利来回答祖国人民对我们的热爱和希望。”接着有许多被崇高荣誉鼓舞着的战士们，争着上台表示了自己的立功决心。他们的态度像在出征前举行誓师大会时一样的庄严。被刘光子带领过的新战士张凤君在会上说：“刘光子的英勇精神鼓舞了我，我也立了功。今后我还要不断提高战术技术，争取更大的光荣！”
    中午，各兄弟连队战士们派的代表，带着鲜花、敲着锣鼓来向刘光子道喜。他们把刘光子从掩蔽部里抬出来，给他带上鲜花，在他面前说快板，扭秧歌。山坡上出现了英雄们的欢乐景象。
    这消息又像捷报一样迅速地传到了最前沿的阵地。当晚前沿阵地上的战士们派出的代表，通过敌人的炮火封锁区来向刘光子道喜。他们说：“刘光子同志的光荣也就是我们的光荣。刘老伯要他更加努力杀敌的嘱咐，也就是祖国人民给我们的嘱咐。我们一定要坚守阵地，多杀敌人，回答祖国人民对我们的热爱！”刘光子以前所在的“大功连”，也派代表来向他道喜，并保证要发扬荣誉，创造更多像他一样的英雄。
    刘尚德的家信从这个阵地传到那个阵地，鼓舞了战士们杀敌立功的战斗精神。刘光子自己也给志愿军司令员彭德怀将军写了一封信，表示了自己英勇杀敌、争取更大荣誉的决心。他又给父亲写了回信。信中说：“我和同志们在前线多杀敌人，你和老乡们在后方努力生产，咱们一齐努力，争取抗美战争早日胜利！”
