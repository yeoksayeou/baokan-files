    World Federation of Trade Unions Pays Tribute to the Korean People and the Chinese People's Volunteers
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 25th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions received a telegram from the World Federation of Trade Unions on the 24th, commemorating the International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace. The telegram reads as follows:
    On this International Day for the Defense of Peace, June 25, 1952, the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of 80 million organized workers worldwide, pays tribute to the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting for freedom and world peace. The World Federation of Trade Unions demands: the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war; the prohibition of the use of all weapons of mass destruction.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions is extremely outraged by the inhumane methods used by American imperialism in prisoner-of-war camps and by bacteriological warfare; at the same time, it expresses its utmost admiration for the courage and determination of the Korean and Chinese brothers in resisting this barbaric behavior. Like you, we deeply know that a great future awaits us. The World Federation of Trade Unions reiterates its demand for an end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction; at the same time, it demands the immediate trial of war criminals who used bacteriological weapons on the Korean front and in Northeast China.
    General Secretary Louis Saillant, June 24, 1952
