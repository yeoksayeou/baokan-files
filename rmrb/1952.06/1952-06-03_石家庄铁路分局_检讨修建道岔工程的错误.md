    Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau
    Self-Criticism for Errors in Siding Construction Project

    To the Editor: We read the letter from the Xingtai Branch of the China Coal Construction Company published in the People's Daily on April 2nd, requesting a solution to the siding construction problem. After reading it, we conducted an investigation and sincerely accept this criticism.

    This siding project began construction in October last year. After receiving a telegram from the Tianjin Railway Administration, we re-examined and reviewed the project and proposed a suspension, and the project was halted. Why was it suspended? The Xingtai Station already had six tracks, which could handle the loading and unloading tasks of the Coal Construction Company. Constructing a dedicated siding would be a waste of existing facilities. Moreover, Xingtai Station does not have a dedicated shunting engine. If train locomotives were used to pick up and deliver from the dedicated line, it would increase the dwell time of freight trains at intermediate stations and prolong the turnaround time of locomotives and rolling stock. This would cause even greater losses to the country. However, in this matter, we exhibited serious bureaucracy. We failed to consider the utilization of Xingtai Station's existing equipment capacity beforehand, and we also failed to consider the losses after construction, blindly agreeing to the construction, resulting in a waste of construction funds. Before the suspension, we did not proactively contact the Coal Construction Company in a timely manner, which was also an error. We will resolutely correct this style of work in the future. On May 8th, we notified the Xingtai China Coal Construction Company of the superior's instructions approving the suspension.

### 石家庄铁路分局  检讨修建道岔工程的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    石家庄铁路分局
    检讨修建道岔工程的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报四月二日刊载中国煤建公司邢台支公司的来信，要求解决道岔工程问题。我们读后进行了检查，我们诚恳接受这个批评。
    这个道岔工程在去年十月开始修建。接到天津铁路管理局电示后，我们重新研究审查，提出了停修意见，工程于是停顿。为什么要停修呢？邢台车站原有六股道，可以负担煤建公司的装卸任务。如果另修专用道岔，就浪费了原有设备。而且邢台车站也没有专用调车机，若使用列车机车到专用线取送，将增加货物列车中间站的停留时间，也延长了机车车辆的周转时间。这会给国家造成更大的损失。但在这个问题中，我们是有严重的官僚主义的。我们在事前没有考虑到发挥邢台车台现有的设备能力，也没有考虑到修建后的损失，即盲目同意修建，结果浪费了工程费。在停修前，我们没有主动地和煤建公司及时联系，这也是错误。我们今后在工作中要坚决纠正这种作风。五月八日，我们已把上级准予停修的指示通知了邢台中国煤建公司。
