    An Event of Great Historical Significance
    By Bo Gejin, Correspondent of the Soviet "Pravda" in Stalingrad Oblast
    The city of Stalingrad stretches for dozens of kilometers along the banks of the Volga River. Between the tractor factory in the northernmost part of the city and the workers' residential area in the southern suburbs—Red Army City—there is an excellent asphalt road. This road does not end at Red Army City. It extends further south and southwest, running parallel to the navigable canal, all the way from Stalingrad to Kalach.
    New residential areas for the canal's river affairs staff, consisting of comfortable little houses, have appeared behind the old city. There is a club and a good school here. The streets are lined with fresh asphalt and lush young poplars and maples. This residential area was built on a wilderness where, not long ago, sheep were grazing.
    Not far from here is the lock at the entrance to the Volga-Don Canal. We saw the gates of the canal—the triumphal arch of the first lock. Ships, barges, and motorboats from the Volga River to the Don River and from the Don River to the Volga River will pass through this gate. The canal entrance is located not far from the opposite side of the Little Salpin Peninsula. Here, on the corner of a cliff, stands a beautiful twenty-meter-high lighthouse. It will guide ships to the canal.
    Slightly to the side, a huge bronze statue of Comrade Stalin, the leader of all nationalities, towers over the Volga River. It can be seen from afar—from the streets and squares of Stalingrad, from the ships sailing in the Volga River.
    Just a few days ago, the Volga River was surging beside a huge embankment separating the river water from the first lock. Below, in the deep lock chamber, the final construction work was still underway, and dozens of machines were operating in the low-lying area of the lock. But now, the Volga River, through the hospitable gates opened before it, has poured into and filled the lock chamber.
    At this time, the waters of the Don River, pumped to the watershed by pumping stations, continued to flow down the huge lock ladder toward the Volga, to greet the waters of the Volga. On May 24th, a temporary dam not far from the Varvarovka Reservoir was still separating the waters of the Don River from the Volga side. However, on the evening of May 27th, the river water filled the watershed section of the canal, as well as the ninth and eighth locks, flowing to the high gates of the seventh lock.
    On May 30th, the gates of the sixth lock were opened. A green torrent poured into the lock chamber, spreading widely over the Solyanka depression. The buoys, pre-set by the river affairs workers along the route and tied to anchors, rose and floated.
    The waters of the Don River continued to flow unhindered along the "green street"—or what the canal builders themselves called the "passage." The surging water flow in the canal bed was accelerating its speed every hour. The Don River rushed irrepressibly towards the Volga. Soon it passed through the fifth and fourth locks—the last two locks of the Chapurnikov ladder.
    Beyond the fourth lock is the Red Army construction area, which built the locks closest to the Volga River—the third, second, and first locks. These were long prepared to receive the water. In the eight-kilometer section between the fourth and third locks, all basic work was completed last year. Now the banks of the canal are clad in sturdy stone shirts. The riverbed has been flattened and cleared.
    The water flowed in the bottom of the flat canal bed. The rushing torrent washed the stone slopes of the canal banks. The water level in the canal rose very quickly, visibly higher and higher. Hundreds of people happily welcomed this surging torrent, celebrating the birth of this new waterway that forever unites the Don and Volga Rivers.
    …People were waiting for the waters of the Don River at the third lock. The construction scaffolding on the control tower had been removed the day before. The bright, dazzling white of these scaffolds stood out beautifully against the green background of the grassland. The builders of the third lock had expended a great deal of effort, energy, and talent to ensure that this outstanding building was put into use on time. Leading this construction was the young engineer and Communist Party member, Yaroslav Sobolev.
    Sobolev, like the other builders of the lock, was happily excited today. Of course! This was a solemn day, a day they had eagerly awaited and accelerated its arrival with selfless labor.
    Hundreds of people gathered near the lock and on the long reinforced concrete docks of the gate. Everyone intently watched the distance, watched the watershed side, from which the water of the canal would flow. Finally, someone shouted with joy:
    "The water is coming!"
    In fact, the just visible ribbon of light was still about one and a half kilometers away. The water quickly approached. Soon the water flow foamed on the dockside, hitting the metal gate. This was the morning of May 31st. The water increased rapidly. Finally, it reached the required height. An order was given: "Open the sluice!"
    The sluice—the latch on the water gate. The water rushed like a noisy waterfall through the lock into the deep reinforced concrete lock chamber, splashing out of the lock chamber like a huge spring beyond the low gate, and unceasingly sped forward along the canal—towards the second lock.
    The history of this lock is extraordinary. It was built with Caspian clay. This type of soil can only be found in this area that was once the seabed of the Caspian Sea. Caspian clay is a very solid and heavy soil. The excavator operators had to exert a great deal of effort before excavating the lock's recess. After the cement pouring work began in front of the lower layer of the lock, an unexpected event occurred: thirty thousand cubic meters of clay collapsed into the recess, burying the formwork prepared for laying the cement.
    But all the staff gloriously completed the task entrusted to them. To eliminate this obstruction, they adopted a double-mold grouting method—a new and efficient method of pouring cement. At the Party meeting in the construction section, the first person to come up with this valuable idea was the formwork worker Shmakov. Communists and the construction director Alexandrov supported the innovator's proposal. As a result, great achievements were obtained: the speed of cement laying increased threefold. A lot of funds, materials, and manpower were saved.
    People were waiting for the waters of the Don River at the second lock with extraordinary enthusiasm.
    Today, May 31st, the morning in Stalingrad was overcast. A warm spring drizzle was falling. But this did not prevent the celebration. Thousands of canal construction workers, employees of various enterprises in Stalingrad, and members of nearby collective farms came to the line between the first and second locks, where a historically significant event would take place—the waters of the Don River would travel a hundred kilometers to meet the waters of the Volga River.
    It was already noon. The clouds had dissipated, and the canal, like a flexible steel band, shimmered in the sun. The grassland exuded the fragrance of grass and flowers. It seemed that nature itself was also joyful and reveling with the people.
    The workers slightly opened the upper gates of the second lock. The waters of the Don River poured into the lock chamber and flowed into the waterway below the canal gate. At the same time, an excavator also dug a gap in the embankment near the upper gate of the first lock. The powerful water flow of the Volga River rushed forward to meet the waters of the Don River.
    The first and second locks are one thousand three hundred meters apart. After twenty minutes, the two giant flows met almost exactly in the middle of the two locks. The river water foamed, boiled, and then calmed down, steadily filling the canal's cobblestone-paved sloping banks.
    This happened at 1:55 PM Moscow time.
    The triumphant melody of the Soviet national anthem broadcast far and wide. Thousands of people gathered here greeted the convergence of Russia's two mighty rivers—the Volga and the Don—with jubilant hearts. Warm slogans of "Glory to the great Stalin" and shouts of "Ura" echoed endlessly on both banks of the canal. People hugged each other and congratulated each other.
    The gratifying and historically significant event was completed. The Volga and Don Rivers are connected! The dream of the Russian people for many centuries has been realized.
    …We crossed the first lock and reached the high slope of the Volga River. From here, one can look out over the Volga River. Along its mirror-smooth surface, in endless rows, sailed fleets of barges, rafts, steamships, and small boats. For the time being, they are still sailing in two directions—up or down the Volga River. Now the Volga River's powerful fleet will soon acquire a new route—heading to the Don River, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea. Ships carrying timber from the Kama River and the upper reaches of the Volga River, coal from the Donets, wheat from the Kuban, oil from Baku, and machinery will travel along the canal in both directions.
    The Volga-Don Canal is ready for navigation. Now the final construction and finishing work along the canal line has been completed. Cement factories and other installations have begun to be dismantled.
    River affairs staff came to the canal as early as last winter. They first observed and became accustomed to the environment, and then studied the canal and its construction. Now they solemnly assume the rights of the canal's owners. Electrical mechanics, buoy installers, supervisors, photographers—all river transport workers are prepared to work resolutely for the canal. They have all been transferred to serve on this new waterway transport line from Stalingrad to Rostov.
    In the bends of the Volga and Don Rivers, the ships prepared to navigate the new waterway have been re-equipped. Some new ports have been renovated and built on both banks of the river.
    In accordance with the will of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the great route built by the Soviet working people—the first great project of communist construction—will soon become an active transportation artery.

    富有历史意义的事件
    苏联“真理报”驻斯大林格勒州记者  波哥金
    斯大林格勒城沿伏尔加河岸延展有数十公里。城最北边的拖拉机工厂和城南郊的工人住宅区——红军城——之间，有一条最好的柏油公路。这条公路到红军城并没有终止。它又向南方和西南方伸展出去，与通航运河平行着，一直由斯大林格勒到卡拉奇。
    由舒适的小房子组成的运河的河务工作人员的新住宅区，在以前的城市后边出现了。这里有一个俱乐部、一所很好的学校。街上是新鲜的柏油路和翠绿的小杨树和枫树。这个住宅区是建立在一片荒野上的，不久以前这儿还牧放着羊群。
    离这里不远，就是伏尔加—顿运河入口处的水闸。我们看到了运河的大门——第一个闸的凯旋门。由伏尔加河到顿河和由顿河到伏尔加河的轮船、驳船和汽艇将通过这个门。运河的进口处在距小萨尔宾半岛对面不远的地方。这儿，在断崖的角上，竖起了一个美丽的二十公尺高的灯塔。它将指给船只通向运河的道路。
    稍为旁边一点，一座各族人民的领袖斯大林同志的巨大的铜像，高高耸立在伏尔加河上。从很远的地方——从斯大林格勒的大街和广场上，从伏尔加河中航行的船只上，都可以看见它。
    还是在几天以前，伏尔加的河水就在一条隔开河水和第一道水闸的巨大的横堤旁澎湃着。下边，在深深的闸舱中，还在进行着最后的建筑工作，在水闸低处的凹地，开动着数十架机器。但是现在，伏尔加的河水通过了它面前那殷勤好客地敞开着的闸门，注满了闸舱。
    这时，被抽水站抽到分水岭的顿河的河水，继续沿着巨大的水闸梯向伏尔加这方面流下来，来迎接伏尔加的水。在五月二十四日时，距瓦尔瓦罗夫卡水库不远的一座临时堤坝还在把顿河的水和伏尔加这方面隔开着。但是，在五月二十七日晚上，河水注满了运河的分水岭部分，也注满了第九闸和第八闸，流到了第七道水闸的高门。
    五月三十日，第六闸的闸门打开了。带有绿色的洪流涌入了闸舱，广阔地漫过了索凉卡洼地。这个地方由河务工作者们预先沿路设置的系在铁锚上的浮标上升了，漂浮起来了。
    顿河的水继续毫无阻碍地沿着“绿街”——或者像运河建筑者们自己所称为的“通路”——流下去。运河河床中汹涌的水流，每小时都在加快着奔跑的速度。顿河不能抑制地奔向伏尔加。很快就通过了第五闸和第四闸——查普尔尼科夫梯最后的两道水闸。
    过了第四闸，就是红军建筑区的地带，这个区建设了距伏尔加河最近的几个闸——第三、第二和第一闸。这里早已准备好来接受水了。在第四闸与第三闸之间的八公里的地段，一切基本工作还在去年时就结束了。现在运河的河岸都穿上了牢固的石衬衣。河底已经平坦了，清除过了。
    河水在平坦的运河河床底部涌流着。急奔的巨流冲洗着运河河岸的石斜坡。运河中的水位上升得非常快，眼看着愈来愈高。数百人快乐地迎接这奔腾的急流，庆贺这条使顿河和伏尔加河永远结成亲戚的新航路的诞生。
    ……人们已经在第三闸上等待着顿河的水。操纵塔上的建筑架，前一天已经拆除。这些建筑架的光亮的耀眼的白色，在草原的绿色背景下，显得异常美丽。为了使这个卓越的建筑物按时开始应用，第三道闸的建筑者们，曾费了不少的力量、精力和才能。领导这个建筑的是年青的工程师、共产党员雅罗斯拉夫·索勃列夫。
    索勃列夫今天和水闸的其他建筑者一样很快乐地激动着。当然！这是一个隆重的日子，这个日子他们曾急不可耐地等待着并且以忘我的劳动来加快它的到来。
    数百人集合在闸旁和闸上门的长长的钢筋混凝土的码头附近。大家都紧张地注视着远方，注视着分水岭那方面，运河的水将从那边流过来。最后，不知是谁欢呼了一声：
    “水来了！”
    事实上，刚刚看得见的光亮的带子，还离此地约有一公里半。水很快地临近了。水流不久便在码头岸边翻着水泡，碰到金属的闸门。这是今天，五月三十一日早晨的事。水很快地增多了。最后，达到了需要的高度。下了一声命令：“打开闸闩！”
    闸闩——是水门上的闩。水像噪闹的瀑布一样冲过水闸进入深深的钢筋混凝土的闸舱，像巨大的涌泉一样从闸舱溅出到低门以外，不停留地沿运河向前奔驰而去——奔向第二道闸。
    这一个水闸的历史是不平凡的。它是用里海的粘土筑成的。这种土只有在以前曾是里海海底的这个地方才找得到。里海的粘土是一种很坚实、分量很重的土壤。挖掘机的机手们在挖好水闸的凹地以前，曾费了很大的力气。当在水闸低层前部开始了浇灌水泥的工作后，发生了一件意外的事：三万立方公尺的粘土倾塌入凹地中，埋住了准备用来敷设水泥的模板。
    但全体工作人员们仍然光荣地完成了所负的任务。为了消除这种阻滞，他们采用了双模灌浆法——一种浇灌水泥的新的高效率方法。在该工段的党的会议上，第一个想到这一宝贵意见的，是模板制造工人什马可夫。共产党员们和建筑区的主任亚历山德罗夫支持了革新者的建议。于是获得了巨大的成绩：敷设水泥的工作速度提高到三倍。资金、材料和人力，都节省了很多。
    人们正在第二道水闸处，以异常高度的热情等候着顿河的水。
    今天，五月三十一日，在斯大林格勒一清早便是阴天。下着暖和的春天的毛毛细雨。但这并没有能妨碍这次的庆祝。数千名运河建筑工作者、斯大林格勒各个企业的职工，附近各集体农庄的庄员们都来到第一道水闸和第二道水闸间的线路上，具有历史意义的事件将在这里发生——顿河的水将行经一百公里的路程，与伏尔加河的水在这里汇合。
    已经是正午的时候了。乌云已经消散，运河像一条有弹性的钢做的带子一样，在太阳下面闪烁着。草原发出了草和花的芳香。好像大自然本身也在和人们一道愉快和狂欢。
    工人们微微地打开了第二道水闸上部的闸门。顿河的水涌进闸舱，流入运河水门下部的水道。与此同时，挖掘机也在第一道水闸上部闸门附近的横堤上，挖开了一个缺口。伏尔加河的强有力的水流急奔向前去迎接顿河的水。
    第一道水闸和第二道水闸彼此相距一千三百公尺。过了二十分钟，这两道巨流几乎正是在两道水闸的中点相遇了。河水吐着泡沫，沸腾着，然后又安静了下来，平稳地灌满了运河的铺砌着圆石的倾斜的河岸。
    这发生在莫斯科时间下午一点五十五分。
    苏联国歌的胜利的旋律远远地在四周播送着。数千名聚集在这儿的人们怀着狂欢的心情迎接俄国的两条强大的河流——伏尔加河与顿河——的汇合。热烈的口号声“光荣归于伟大的斯大林”和“乌拉”声长久不息地在运河的两岸上响着。人们互相拥抱并彼此祝贺。
    可喜的具有历史意义的事件完成了。伏尔加河和顿河联结了！俄国人民好多世纪以来的梦想实现了。
    ……我们越过第一道水闸到达了伏尔加河的高高的斜坡上。从这里可以遥望伏尔加河。沿着它的镜子般平滑的水面上，以无穷无尽的行列，航行着驳船、木筏、汽轮和小艇的船队。暂时它们还是沿着两个方向航行——沿着伏尔加河上驶或下行。现在伏尔加河的强大的船队将很快获得新的航线——驶向顿河、亚速海和黑海。装有喀马河和伏尔加河上游的木材、顿尼茨的煤和库班的小麦、巴库的石油和机器的船只，将沿着运河的两个方向行驶。
    伏尔加—顿运河已经准备开航。现在沿运河线路的最后的建筑和装修工作已经完成。水泥工厂和其他的装置已经开始拆卸。
    河务工作人员们早在去年冬天即已来到运河上。他们首先观察、习惯环境，然后研究运河和它的建筑。现在他们郑重地担负起运河的主人的权利。电气机械装置师，装设浮标的工人，监工，摄影师——所有的河运工作者，都准备着坚毅地为运河工作。他们都是被调到由斯大林格勒到罗斯多夫的这条新的水路运输干线上来服务的。
    在伏尔加河和顿河的河湾，已经重新装备了预备在新的水路上航行的船只。在河的两岸上重新修盖和建筑了一些新的港口。
    依照着列宁—斯大林党的意志，由苏联劳动人民所建造的伟大的航线——共产主义建设的第一个伟大工程——将很快地成为一个活跃的运输干线。（君强、振亚合译，原载六月一日苏联真理报）
