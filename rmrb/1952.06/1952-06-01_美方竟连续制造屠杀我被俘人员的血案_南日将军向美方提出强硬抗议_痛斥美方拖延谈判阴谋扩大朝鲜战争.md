Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 31st: At the plenary session of the delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on May 31st, our chief representative lodged a strong protest with the other side regarding the bloody incidents of the U.S. side's slaughtering of our captured personnel on May 29th and 30th:

"On May 29th, your side killed three of our captured personnel and injured thirteen at the Yongcheon prisoner-of-war camp. On May 30th, your side killed four of our captured personnel and injured three at the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. I lodge a strong protest with your side, demanding that you immediately cease the slaughter of our captured personnel. Your side has not provided any explanation for the previous incidents of slaughtering our captured personnel, and brazenly disregards our repeated solemn protests and the unanimous angry condemnation of the people of the world, and blatantly continues to slaughter our captured personnel. This is clearly an intentional act of provocation, aimed at obstructing the resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue, delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, creating a tense atmosphere, and plotting to expand the Korean War. Your side must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom."

General Nam Il went on to point out that since May 2nd, the other side has not only refused to conduct consultations within the meeting, but has also continuously slaughtered our captured personnel outside the meeting, clearly deliberately obstructing the reasonable resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue, delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations, creating a tense atmosphere, and plotting to expand the Korean War. General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

"The bloody incident of your side once again openly slaughtering our captured personnel once again proves that your side's plan to detain our captured personnel is a bloody, barbaric, illegal, and criminal conspiracy. The bloody facts expose all the deceptive lies. No slander or fabrication can cover up the fact that your side is the murderer of prisoners-of-war. No slander or fabrication can cover up the fact that our captured personnel, who are fighting heroically, would rather die than submit to your side's conspiracy to detain them by force. The plan put forward by your side on April 28th, which attempts to detain our captured personnel, is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles. The confession of your prisoner-of-war camp commander to the world and the continuous occurrence of slaughter incidents have irrevocably declared the complete bankruptcy of your side's plan. Any fabrication or rumor-mongering by your side at this meeting cannot save this plan from bankruptcy, and any arrogant expression cannot cover up the crime of this plan. Since the discussion of the prisoner-of-war issue began last December, your side has never made any concessions and has always insisted on the claim to detain our captured personnel. Our side has made a series of efforts on the prisoner-of-war issue based on our consistent position of resolving the issue through consultation within a reasonable scope. In order to dispel your side's so-called excuse that the complete repatriation of prisoners-of-war would increase the military strength of one of the belligerents, our side suggested on February 3rd that the commanders of both sides guarantee that the prisoners-of-war of both sides would live peacefully after repatriation and would no longer participate in war actions. In order to take into account the situation that some of the prisoners-of-war held by both sides had their original residences in the side holding them, our side also put forward on March 27th the principle of adjustment that would enable the prisoners-of-war of both sides to immediately return home and live peacefully after the armistice. Our side's plan on the prisoner-of-war issue is a plan to guarantee that the prisoners-of-war of both sides return home and live peacefully. This is the fairest and most reasonable compromise plan for resolving the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation. If your side has the sincerity to stop the Korean War, your side can have no reason to oppose resolving the prisoner-of-war issue, which is the only obstacle to the Korean armistice, based on our side's plan. However, since May 2nd, your side has been adopting an arrogant and domineering attitude in the meeting, using arbitrary and intimidating language, treating unreasonableness as strength, and refusing to conduct any consultation. Outside the meeting, your side disregards our repeated protests and continuously slaughters our captured personnel, not hesitating to turn your prisoner-of-war camps into murder factories in order to realize your side's disgraceful plan to detain our captured personnel. The purpose of your actions is clearly not to resolve the issue through consultation, but to systematically obstruct the reasonable resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue, to systematically delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations, to systematically create a tense atmosphere by various despicable means, and to systematically plot to expand the Korean War. The Korean armistice could have been easily achieved, but the fact that Korea has not yet achieved an armistice, the prisoners-of-war of both sides have not yet returned home, and the tense situation in the world has not been relaxed is entirely the responsibility of your side. For the sake of the Korean armistice, your side must immediately stop slaughtering our captured personnel, change your unreasonable attitude, withdraw the claim to detain prisoners-of-war, and accept our side's plan of May 2nd as the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue."

    美方竟连续制造屠杀我被俘人员的血案
    南日将军向美方提出强硬抗议
    痛斥美方拖延谈判阴谋扩大朝鲜战争
    【新华社开城五月三十一日电】五月三十一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表就五月二十九日与三十日美方两次屠杀我方被俘人员的血案，向对方提出强硬抗议：
    “五月二十九日，你方在永川战俘营杀死我方被俘人员三名，伤十三名。五月三十日你方在巨济岛战俘营杀死我方被俘人员四名，伤三名。我向你方提出强硬抗议，要求你方立即停止屠杀我方被俘人员。你方对于历次屠杀我方被俘人员事件未作任何交代，悍然置我方历次的严正抗议和世界人民一致的愤怒指责于不顾，明目张胆地继续屠杀我方被俘人员。这显然是有意的挑衅行为，旨在阻挠战俘问题的解决，拖延朝鲜停战谈判，制造紧张空气，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争。你方必须担负由此而产生的一切严重后果。”
    南日将军继指出对方自五月二日以来，不但在会内拒绝进行协商，更在会外不断屠杀我方被俘人员，显然是故意阻挠战俘问题的合理解决，拖延和破坏停战谈判，制造紧张空气，阴谋扩大朝鲜战争。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “你方又一次公然屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件，再一次证明了你方扣留我方被俘人员的计划是血腥的、野蛮的、非法的、犯罪的阴谋，血的事实揭穿了一切的欺骗谎言。任何诬蔑与捏造都不能掩盖你方是谋杀战俘的凶手。任何诬蔑与捏造都不能掩盖英勇战斗的我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方阴谋扣留的暴力之下。你方在四月二十八日提出的企图扣留我方被俘人员的方案是彻底违反日内瓦公约和人道原则的。你方战俘营长官向全世界的招供和连续发生的屠杀事件，已经不可挽回地宣布了你方方案的彻底破产。你方在这一会上任何捏造和造谣都不能挽救这一方案的破产，任何横蛮的表示都不能掩盖这
    一方案的罪恶。自从去年十二月开始讨论战俘问题以来，你方从未作任何让步而始终坚持扣留我方被俘人员的主张。我方在战俘问题上本着在合理范围内协商解决问题的我方一贯立场曾作一系列的努力。为解除你方所谓全部遣返战俘将增加交战一方的军事力量的藉口，我方在二月三日建议双方司令官保证双方战俘在遣返后过和平生活，不再参加战争行动。为照顾双方收容的战俘中有原籍在收容者
    一方的情况，我方又在三月二十七日提出了使双方战俘在停战后得以立即回家过和平生活的调整原则。我方在战俘问题上的方案，是保证双方战俘回家过和平生活的方案，这是解决战俘遣返问题的最公平、最合理的折衷方案。如果你方有停止朝鲜战争的诚意，你方就不可能有任何理由反对以我方方案为基础，解决唯一阻碍着朝鲜停战的战俘问题。但自从五月二日以来，你方在会内一直采取横蛮霸道的态度，使用武断恐吓的语言，把蛮不讲理当做力量，拒绝进行任何协商。在会外，你方置我方的历次抗议于不顾，不断屠杀我方被俘人员，不惜把你方的战俘营变成一个谋杀工厂，来实现你方扣留我方被俘人员的可耻计划。你们这样做的目的，显然不在协商解决问题，而是有计划地阻挠战俘问题的合理解决，有计划地拖延和破坏停战谈判，有计划地用各种卑鄙手段制造紧张空气，有计划地阴谋扩大朝鲜战争。朝鲜停战本来很容易就可实现，但至今朝鲜未能停战，双方战俘未能回家，全世界的紧张局势未能松弛，其责任完全在于你方。为了朝鲜的停战，你方必须立即停止屠杀我方被俘人员，改变蛮不讲理的态度，撤消扣留战俘的主张，接受我方五月二日的方案为解决战俘问题的唯一合理基础。”
