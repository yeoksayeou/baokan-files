    Su Dianxuan Leads Model Labor Network
    Discusses Summer Harvest, Summer Selection, and Summer Planting Methods
    The model labor network led by Su Dianxuan, a labor model from Lushan, Henan, held a meeting as the spring plowing ended and the wheat harvest approached. Thirty-two labor models from ten townships attended the meeting. They reported on drought prevention, pest control, and other work, focusing on discussing methods for the summer harvest, summer selection, and summer planting. Su Dianxuan proposed that to achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick planting, and harvesting, threshing, and planting simultaneously, two methods should be adopted: 1. Organize rural nurseries or child care groups to mobilize women's labor force as much as possible. Women's wheat cutting is no slower than male labor. With women cutting wheat, men can thresh at the same time. 2. Maximize the effectiveness of collective production. Mutual aid and cooperative organizations can collectively harvest and send people to carry the harvest immediately without using livestock, freeing up livestock so the land where wheat has been harvested can be plowed, harrowed, and sown immediately. Regarding seed selection, after discussion, everyone recognized the relationship between this work and next year's bumper harvest, and seriously discussed seed selection methods. It was decided to observe carefully in the field, determine the selection area, and pay attention to ear selection. The types of selected seeds should be determined based on the specific conditions of the soil in each area, without making unified regulations. They also discussed the selection of corn seeds for summer planting, deciding to prepare two kinds of superior seeds: "Horse Tooth" corn should be planted early when it rains, and "Golden Club" corn, which matures faster, should be planted later when it rains. This meeting was very successful, increased everyone's confidence in increasing production, and played an active role in the model labor network. (Lu Lian)

    苏殿选领导的劳动模范网
    讨论夏收夏选夏种办法
    河南鲁山劳动模范苏殿选领导的劳动模范网，在春耕结束、麦收即将到来的时候开了一次会，到会的有十个乡的三十二个劳动模范，他们汇报了防旱治虫等工作，着重讨论了夏收夏选夏种的办法。苏殿选提出：要做到快收快打快种和边收边打边种，须采取两个办法：1、要组织农忙托儿所或看孩小组，把妇女劳动力尽量动员出来。妇女割麦不比男劳动力慢。妇女割麦，男子就可以同时打场。2、要尽量发挥集体生产的效力。互助合作组织集体收割，可以抽出人来随割随担，不用牲口拉，把牲口腾出来，割过麦子的地就可以随即犁耙播种。关于选种，经过讨论大家认识了这个工作和明年丰产的关系，认真地讨论了选种方法。决定要在田间仔细观察，决定选区，注意穗选。选的种类，依各地的土质等具体情况来决定，不作统一的规定。他们还讨论了夏播的玉米选种问题，决定准备两种优良种籽：落雨早就种“马牙”玉米，落雨晚就种成熟较快的“金棒锤”。这次会开得很好，增加了大家的增产信心，起了劳动模范网的积极作用。（鲁联）
