Xinhua News Agency, June 5th:

    The broad masses of the Soviet people continue to hold rallies, angrily protesting the atrocities of the US imperialists in massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.
    The two largest factories in Leningrad—the Stalin Metal Factory and the Kirov Electrical Factory—held mass rallies to protest the atrocities committed by the American aggressors on Koje Island. Speakers at the rallies—engineers, workers, and staff members—expressed boundless indignation when speaking about the barbaric crimes committed by the US aggressors at the Koje Island and Busan prisoner of war camps. The masses participating in the rallies unanimously passed a resolution strongly protesting the bloody atrocities of the US military in Korea.
    The working people of Donbas are extremely angered by the new crimes committed by the US imperialists in Korea. To express their protest, the metallurgical workers of the Stalinno Factory held a mass rally on June 3rd. Glazkov, the director of the open-hearth furnace department and a Stalin Prize winner, said at the rally: The massacre of defenseless prisoners of war on Koje Island and in Busan, and the testing of poisonous gas and deadly bacteria on them, reveals the barbarity of the US imperialists to the world. Humanity will never forget, nor will it forgive their bloody crimes. We, the metallurgical workers of this factory, like the Soviet people in general, express fraternal sympathy for the heroic defenders of freedom-loving Korea. The rally unanimously passed a resolution firmly protesting the US aggressors' barbaric and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war.
    At a rally at the Kiev Machine-Building Factory, Chief Engineer Ostafyev delivered a speech saying: The Soviet people and all honest men and women in the world strongly protest the atrocities of the US imperialists. The US imperialists' towering crimes of massacring defenseless prisoners of war are more brutal than the atrocities committed by Hitler in the death camps of Auschwitz and Maidanek.
    The staff of the Kasimirovka Machine and Tractor Station in the Mogilev Oblast of Soviet Belarus held a rally. Agricultural worker Lidia Mankevich delivered a speech saying: We Soviet women protest the atrocities of the American cannibals in Korea and demand the punishment of the executioners who massacred the Korean people.
    Thousands of workers at the Tbilisi Railway Repair Factory, workers at the Ural Machine Factory, and many industrial enterprises, institutions, and higher education institutions in cities such as Minsk, Yerevan, and Tashkent also held rallies. In their unanimously passed resolutions, factory workers, scientific and cultural workers all condemned the shamelessness of the American aggressors and demanded an immediate end to the shameful war in Korea.
    Enterprises, institutions, and schools in Tashkent, the capital of the Soviet Uzbek Republic, held protest rallies on June 2nd against the US aggressors' crimes of massacring prisoners of war. More than 5,000 people participated in the rally at the Tashkent Stalin Textile Factory. Spinning worker Milkhashimova delivered a moving speech, saying: We textile workers, along with millions of peace fighters, express our anger and demand that the US imperialists' massacres in Korea be stopped immediately and that war criminals be severely punished.
    Uzbek scientists also angrily condemned the crimes of the American barbarians. The participants in many mass rallies unanimously passed resolutions, expressing support for the Korean people who are bravely fighting for their country's freedom and independence, and firmly demanding an end to the US imperialists' bloody atrocities.
    Towns, villages, machine and tractor stations, and state farms in Altai held rallies to protest the unprecedented crimes of the American murderers in massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. At a rally held by farmers of the Communist Road Collective Farm in the Loktevsky District, Balkov, the leader of a field work team, said: We are extremely indignant after learning about the towering crimes of the American murderers and their accomplices who are massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island and other prisoner of war camps. The US aggressors, enraged by military defeats, are venting their anger by massacring defenseless prisoners of war. But the Korean people cannot be intimidated! On their side is the justice and sympathy of all progressive humanity! The American murderers cannot escape responsibility! Collective farms in many other areas of Altai also held mass rallies to protest the atrocities of the American barbarians.

    [Xinhua News Agency News] According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 3rd telegraph: Vietnam News Agency recently published a commentary entitled "New Crimes of US Imperialists in Korea," exposing the crimes of US imperialists who massacred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island and Busan. The commentary stated: US imperialists recently massacred hundreds of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island and Busan, because they could not force these soldiers to betray their motherlands - Korea and China - and go to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and also because the heroic struggles of the Korean and Chinese soldiers exposed the shameless pretext of the US imperialists' so-called "voluntary repatriation," which is currently hindering the Korean armistice talks.
    The US imperialists fantasize that by using this kind of barbaric massacre they can suppress the patriotic zeal of the Korean and Chinese soldiers in their hands. But in fact, they did not achieve their goal, because the Korean and Chinese soldiers they captured bravely opposed the vicious conspiracies of the brutal US imperialists. The events that occurred in the Koje Island and Busan slaughterhouses further revealed the hideous faces of the imperialist aggressors who attempted to obtain huge profits from war and gunfire, arousing hatred and anger among the people of the world towards the barbaric crimes of the imperialists, and making them intensify their struggle to stop the crimes of the war-mongers.
    The Vietnamese people hate the evil crimes committed by the US imperialists in Korea, and hate the US imperialists for helping the French colonialists continue the war of aggression in Vietnam, therefore they are determined to actively compete in the areas of fighting the enemy and increasing production and practicing economy to strengthen their war of resistance, and in the struggle against imperialism and for lasting world peace, to unite more closely with the Korean and Chinese people and other people of the world.

    苏联人民继续声讨侵朝美军屠杀战俘罪行
    越南通讯社发表评论斥美国扣留战俘的恶毒阴谋
    【新华社五日讯】广大苏联人民继续纷纷举行集会，愤怒地抗议美帝国主义者屠杀朝中战俘的暴行。
    列宁格勒的最大的两个工厂——以斯大林为名的五金工厂和以基洛夫为名的电力工厂——都举行了群众大会，抗议美国侵略者在巨济岛所犯的暴行。大会上发言的人们——工程师、工人和职员们——讲到美国侵略者在巨济岛和釜山战俘营所犯的野蛮罪行时，都表示无比的愤慨。参加大会的群众一致通过一项决议，强烈地抗议美国军队在朝鲜的血腥暴行。
    顿巴斯的劳动人民对于美帝国主义者在朝鲜干出的新的罪行极为愤怒。为了表示抗议，斯大林诺工厂的冶金工人在六月三日举行了一次群众大会。平炉部主任、斯大林奖金获得者格拉兹科夫在大会上说：屠杀巨济岛和釜山的赤手空拳的战俘，并在他们身上试验毒气和致命细菌，这就向全世界揭露了美帝国主义者的野蛮性。人类永不会忘记，也永不会饶恕他们的血腥罪行。我们这个工厂的冶金工人，和一般苏联人民一样地对爱好自由的朝鲜的英勇保卫者表示兄弟般的休戚相关的感情。大会一致通过一项决议，坚决抗议美国侵略者野蛮地、不人道地对待战俘。
    在基辅机器制造厂的一个大会上，总工程师奥斯塔费耶夫发表演讲说：苏联人民和全世界的一切正直的男女强烈抗议美帝国主义者的暴行。美帝国主义者屠杀不能自卫的战俘的滔天的罪行，其残暴程度超过了希特勒在奥斯威辛和麦丹尼克的死亡营中所犯的暴行。
    苏维埃白俄罗斯莫希列夫州卡西米罗夫卡机器拖拉机站的工作人员举行了一次大会，农业家丽迪亚·曼凯发表演讲说：我们苏联妇女抗议美国吃人生番们在朝鲜的暴行，并要求惩办屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手。
    第佛利斯铁路修理厂的数千名工人，乌拉尔机器工厂的工人，和明斯克、埃里温、塔什干等城市中的许多工业企业、机关和高等教育机关也都举行了大会。工厂的职工们与科学及文化工作者们在他们一致通过的决议中都斥责美国侵略者的无耻，并要求立即停止在朝鲜的可耻的战争。
    苏维埃乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干的各企业、机关和学校曾在六月二日举行抗议大会，反对美国侵略者屠杀战俘的罪行。塔什干斯大林纺织厂的大会共有五千多人参加。纺纱工人米尔哈希莫娃发表了一篇动人的演说，她说：我们纺织工人们跟千百万和平战士一致表示愤怒，要求立刻制止美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的屠杀并且严厉惩办战争罪犯。
    乌兹别克的科学家们也愤怒地谴责美国野蛮人的罪行。许多群众大会的参加者一致通过决议，声援为祖国的自由与独立而英勇奋斗的朝鲜人民，并且坚决要求制止美帝国主义者的血腥暴行。
    阿尔泰各城镇、乡村、机器和拖拉机站、国营农场都纷纷举行集会，抗议美国杀人犯屠杀巨济岛朝、中战俘的空前罪行。在洛克特夫斯基区的共产主义之路集体农场农民们举行的一个集会上，一个田间工作组组长巴尔科夫说：我们知道了美国杀人犯和他们的同谋者正在屠杀巨济岛及其他战俘营中的朝、中战俘的滔天罪行之后，极为愤慨。美国侵略者因军事失利而恼羞成怒，屠杀赤手空拳的战俘来出气。但是朝鲜人民是吓不倒的！在他们这一边有着一切进步人类的正义和同情！美国杀人犯无法逃避责任！阿尔泰的其他许多地区的集体农场也举行了群众集会，抗议美国野蛮人的暴行。
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社北越三日电：越南通讯社最近发表了一篇题为“美帝国主义者在朝鲜的新罪行”的评论，揭发美帝国主义者屠杀巨济岛和釜山的朝中战俘的罪行。评论称：美帝国主义者最近在巨济岛和釜山屠杀了数百个朝中战俘，因为他们无法逼使这些战士背叛他们的祖国——朝鲜和中国——而到李承晚和蒋介石那里去，同时也因为朝中战士的英勇斗争揭穿了美帝国主义者的所谓“自愿遣返”的无耻藉口，这个藉口目前阻碍着朝鲜停战谈判。
    美帝国主义者幻想他们利用这种野蛮的屠杀便可以压制在他们手中的朝中战士的爱国热忱。但是事实上他们没有达到目的，因为被他们俘掳的朝中战士勇敢地反对残暴的美帝国主义者的恶毒阴谋。巨济岛和釜山屠场中所发生的事件，更进一步地揭发了那些企图从战争和炮火中获得庞大利润的帝国主义侵略者的狰狞面目，激起了全世界人民对帝国主义者野蛮罪行的仇恨和愤怒，使他们加紧为制止战争贩子的罪行而斗争。
    越南人民痛恨美帝国主义者在朝鲜所犯的万恶的罪行，痛恨美帝国主义者帮助法国殖民者继续在越南进行侵略战争，因此他们决心在对敌斗争、增产节约方面积极竞赛以加强他们的抗战，并且在反对帝国主义争取世界持久和平的斗争中，与朝鲜和中国人民及全世界的其他人民更紧密地团结起来。
