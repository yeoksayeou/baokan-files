Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 12th: Letters from the Korean People's Army prisoners of war detained on Koje Island have further aroused the Korean people's unparalleled anger at the American aggressors' crimes of massacring prisoners of war. Responsible individuals from various democratic political parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life in Korea have successively issued statements and held meetings in recent days, unanimously expressing their determination to sever the bloody hands of the American butchers with practical struggle and completely crush the enemy's sinister plot to detain our prisoners of war.

Han Sol Ya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, said: "The enemy's retaliatory and brutal acts of slaughter are being carried out in coordination with their dealings in Panmunjom. Peace-loving people all over the world are enraged by the atrocities of the American murdering devils, and they have become even clearer about who is humanity's mortal enemy. We, along with peace-loving people all over the world, must resolutely stop the American aggressors' crimes of abusing and killing prisoners of war. We must rescue our prisoners of war from the enemy's clutches, where they are threatened with death."

Cho Bok Rye, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League, said: "We Korean women are listening to the accusations and appeals of our prisoners of war on Koje Island with great sorrow and anger. No force can frustrate our determination to rescue our husbands, sons, and brothers. The just struggle of the Korean people, supported and echoed by progressive humanity all over the world, will surely be victorious. We must severely punish the American imperialist murderers."

Jeong Seong-eon, Vice-Chairman of the Democratic Party, said: "Is it possible that the just behavior of our prisoners of war in demanding humane treatment, refusing to betray their motherland, and refusing to serve as cannon fodder for aggression is the reason for the thugs to persecute them with tanks, machine guns, and tear gas? American imperialism is such a desperately vicious and unreasonable group of thugs! In order to stop the enemy's atrocities of massacring our prisoners of war on a large scale with modern weapons, we will fight to the end with unyielding spirit!"

Kim Dal-hyeon, Chairman of the Korean Cheondoist Chongu Party, said: "We cannot tolerate the precarious situation of our prisoners of war on Koje Island. Our compatriots throughout the country will do everything possible to rescue them. Before the just opinion of the world, before all peace-loving people, we once again accuse the crimes of the American aggressors and resolutely demand sanctions against the criminals who participated in and organized the atrocities of massacring our prisoners of war. The American aggressors must bear full responsibility for their crimes."

Kang Ryang-uk, Chairman of the Korean Christian Federation, and Kim Se-ryul, Chairman of the North Korean Buddhist Federation, also issued statements denouncing the American aggressors' ever-increasing crimes of massacring prisoners of war and insisting on the absurd claim of detaining our prisoners of war. They unanimously expressed their determination to fight to save our tormented prisoners of war.

Workers, peasants, and people from cultural, artistic, and religious circles in various parts of Korea have held meetings one after another, seriously protesting against the American aggressors' atrocities of massacring our prisoners of war. The protest meeting of working women in Pyongyang was held on the 9th. Oh Bok-hyeon, Chairman of the Pyongyang Democratic Women's League, called on all Korean women and peace-loving people all over the world to rise up together at the meeting to sanction the war criminals Truman, Acheson, Ridgway, Clark, and Bonner. She emphasized: "We Korean women must accomplish our glorious task, strike the enemy more heavily, actively strive for peace, and fight to the end to enable our compatriots to return home!" Those who spoke at the meeting unanimously expressed their confidence in severing the enemy's bloody hands of killing prisoners of war and crushing the enemy's conspiracy to detain our prisoners of war.

Cultural and art workers in various places resolutely stated at the protest meeting that they would thoroughly expose the decadent nature and ugly faces of the aggressors, so as to further strengthen the Korean people's animosity and fighting spirit, strive for greater victory, and enable our prisoners of war to get rid of the dark hell and return home to live a peaceful life as soon as possible.
