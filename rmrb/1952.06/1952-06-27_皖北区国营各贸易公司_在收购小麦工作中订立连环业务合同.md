    State-Owned Trading Companies in the Wanbei Area Establish Interlocking Business Contracts in Wheat Procurement
    The state-owned trading companies in the Wanbei area have greatly improved their working methods by establishing interlocking business contracts in the wheat procurement process. Wheat has already been released onto the market in the Wanbei area, with the main distribution center in Hefei City seeing an average daily market volume of 350,000 jin. The Anhui South and Anhui North branches of the China National Grain Company and various trade departments jointly established a wheat harvest market in Hefei City at the end of May. Acquisition sheds were set up in the market, and the number of scales was increased or decreased at any time depending on the number of farmers selling wheat each day, so that farmers did not have to wait too long to sell their wheat. Revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, and mutual aid teams selling collectively were given preferential treatment with early purchases. Service personnel dispatched by the Grain Company in the market solved various difficulties for farmers and maintained market order at all times. Loudspeakers constantly promoted the people's government's good wheat, good price policy to the farmers, and farmers who sold excellent wheat were invited to broadcast their production experience to everyone.
    The State-Owned Grain Company also signed interlocking business contracts with the Anhui South and Anhui North branches of the China Salt Industry Company and the Anhui South and Anhui North branches of the People's Bank of China, simplifying procedures, improving work efficiency, and making it more convenient for farmers to buy and sell. After selling their wheat, farmers can take the sales ticket issued by the Grain Company to the People's Bank working group to withdraw money. If they need to buy salt, they can also take the sales ticket to the salt company's business group in the market. The Anhui South and Anhui North branches of the China National Department Store and the China National Native Produce Company also organized promotion teams to transport a large number of daily necessities to supply to farmers. At present, various daily necessities worth about six to seven million yuan are sold to farmers every day. In order to further facilitate farmers' purchase of various goods, the Grain Company is also preparing to sign interlocking business contracts with state-owned companies such as department stores and native produce companies.

    皖北区国营各贸易公司
    在收购小麦工作中订立连环业务合同
    皖北区国营各贸易公司在收购小麦中订立了连环业务合同，工作方法大大改进。皖北区小麦已经上市，该区主要集散地合肥市，平均每天上市量有三十五万斤。中国粮食公司皖南、皖北分公司和各贸易部门在五月底已在合肥市联合成立了午收市场。市场内搭起了收购棚，收购时根据每天售麦农民的多少来随时增减磅秤，使农民不必等候过久就可把麦子卖掉。对前来出售小麦的革命烈士、革命军人家属及互助组集体售卖的，并给予提前收购的优待。市场上粮食公司派出的服务员，随时随地解决农民的各种困难和维持市场秩序。扩音机随时向农民宣传人民政府的好麦好价政策，并邀请出售优良麦子的农民向大家广播自己的生产经验。
    国营粮食公司还和中国盐业公司皖南、皖北分公司及中国人民银行皖南、皖北分行签订了连环业务合同，简化手续、提高工作效率，使农民卖买时更便利。农民卖掉麦子后拿粮食公司发给的售货票，便可到人民银行的工作组去取款，需要购买食盐，也可拿着售货票到市场内盐业公司营业组去买。中国百货公司皖南、皖北分公司和中国土产公司皖南、皖北分公司，也分别组织了推销小组，运去大批日用品供应农民。现在每天卖给农民的各种日用品约值六、七百万元。为了更加便利农民购买各种物品，粮食公司并准备与百货、土产等国营公司也订立连环业务合同。（新华社）
