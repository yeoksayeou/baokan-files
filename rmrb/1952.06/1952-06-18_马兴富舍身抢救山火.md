Ma Xingfu Sacrifices Himself to Rescue a Mountain Fire

To the Editor: Ma Xingfu, a member of the Communist Youth League from Yushi Village, Jiulong Township, Yanzhong District, Xichang County, Xikang Province, gloriously sacrificed his life to rescue a burning forest. The great spirit of Comrade Ma Xingfu, who loved national property and did not hesitate to sacrifice himself, deeply moved me. Therefore, I am telling you about his glorious deeds, hoping that you will publish them so that everyone can learn from him.

On March 2nd of this year, Ma Xingfu finished digging a ditch and was resting by the field. At this time, a fire suddenly broke out in the forest on the mountain. Ma Xingfu didn't even bother to put on his shoes, immediately went home to get a machete, and went up the mountain with seven farmers to fight the fire. They cut down green wood branches to beat the fire around the fire, preventing the fire from spreading. Before long, the leaves on the green wood branches were burned out. Disregarding the danger, Ma Xingfu climbed up a pine tree to cut pine branches. Just then, the pine tree was surrounded by fire. He cut two pine branches and jumped down. Flames taller than a person swept towards him with the wind. He rushed out of the flames, took seven or eight steps, and passed out. The farmers quickly helped him away. At that time, both of his soles were burned, his legs were burned, and his head was swollen.

On March 19th, Comrade Ma Xingfu gloriously sacrificed himself due to his serious injuries. Before his death, he said to his mother: "Mom, that year you took me to weed rice seedlings for the landlord. When we got to the field, the landlord thought I was too small and didn't want me. Do you still remember the misery of that time! Now Chairman Mao is leading us to turn ourselves over. I went to fight the fire to prevent the forest from being damaged. This is for everyone's benefit. I went consciously and voluntarily, this is what I should do. Don't be sad when I die." He also asked his mother to tell his brother, who was working in the district people's government, to work hard.

Martyr Ma Xingfu was a Hui youth, 22 years old, from a poor peasant background. Before liberation, his family had no land or house and suffered from the landlord's oppression and exploitation. His father died when he was four years old. His mother and brother worked hard all year round, but the family still lacked food and clothing. He started working for others at the age of eleven. Therefore, he understood what class and exploitation meant at a very young age.

After liberation, under the education of the Party, he actively participated in revolutionary work. In June 1951, he requested to join the Volunteer Army, but was not approved, so he was determined to do a good job in the rear. He actively took the lead in farming land for the families of the Volunteer Army, and the military families were very satisfied. During the land reform, he struggled resolutely and was very busy with his work, often neglecting to eat. The masses supported him very much. In October of the same year, he gloriously joined the Communist Youth League.

When Martyr Ma Xingfu was buried, the villagers voluntarily took out cloth, rice, and oil to prepare for his funeral. All the men, women, and children in the village came to the funeral. In order to commemorate him, the villagers are determined to do a better job in fire prevention and forest protection. Now the village has strengthened the work of the forest protection team and decided to build a pine forest on the top of the mountain as a memorial forest for Martyr Ma Xingfu. Li Rong

    马兴富舍身抢救山火
    编辑同志：西康省西昌县盐中区九龙乡玉石村青年团员马兴富，为了抢救失火的山林，光荣地献出了自己的生命。马兴富烈士爱护国家财富而不惜牺牲自己的生命的伟大精神，深深地感动了我。因此我把他的光辉事迹告诉你们，希望你们登载出来，让大家向他学习。
    今年三月二日，马兴富挖完了沟，在地边休息。这时山上的树林突然起了大火。马兴富连鞋都顾不上穿，立刻回家拿了一把砍刀，和七个农民到山上去救火。他们砍下青木树枝围着火场打火，防止火势蔓延。没有多久，青木树枝上的叶子就被火烧光了。马兴富不顾危险，爬到松树上去砍松枝。就在这时，松树被火围住了。他砍了两根松枝，就往下跳。比人还高的火焰，随风向他扑来。他冲出火焰，走了七八步，就昏过去了。农民们赶紧把他扶走。那时，他两个脚掌被烧焦了，腿被烧烂了，头也被烧肿了。
    三月十九日，马兴富同志终因伤势过重，光荣地牺牲了。他在临死时对他母亲说：“妈，那年你带我去给地主薅大秧。走到田边，地主嫌我小，还不要我。你还记得那时的惨处吧！现在毛主席领导我们翻了身，我去救火，为的使树林不受损失。这是为的大家的利益。我是自觉自愿地去的，这是应该的。我死了，你不要难过。”他还让母亲转告他参加区人民政府工作的哥哥，好好工作。
    马富兴烈士是个回族青年，现年二十二岁，贫农成分。解放前，他家无地无房，受尽地主的压迫剥削。他四岁时，父亲就死了。母亲、哥哥终年做苦工，家里还是少吃没穿。从十一岁起，他就帮人做活。因此，他年纪很小，就懂得了什么叫阶级，什么叫剥削。
    解放后，在党的教育下，他积极参加了革命工作。一九五一年六月，他要求参加志愿军，没被批准，就决心在后方做好工作。他积极带头给志愿军家属代耕，军属都很满意。土地改革中，他坚决斗争，工作很忙，常常顾不上吃饭。群众都很拥护他。同年十月，他光荣地加入了青年团。
    马兴富烈士安葬的时候，村里的群众自动地拿出布、米和油，替他筹备丧事。全村男女老幼都来送葬。全村群众为了纪念他，决心把防火护林工作做得更好。现在该村已经加强了护林小组的工作，并决定在山顶上造一片松林，作为马兴富烈士纪念林。  李荣
