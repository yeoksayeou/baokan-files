    Go to Xikang

    I had just finished traveling in Sichuan last December when a batch of military vehicles were heading to Garzê. I decided to take this opportunity to see the Xikang Plateau.
    We departed from Chengdu in the morning and arrived in Ya'an, the capital of Xikang Province, a little after two in the afternoon. Separated from Sichuan by only a mountain, it is surrounded by towering peaks, with a fertile basin in the middle. We passed through the center of the basin, our eyes catching glimpses of small villages hidden in bamboo groves, broad bean fields with blue flowers blooming in the warm sunshine, and crisscrossing rice paddies. It was almost impossible to tell the difference from the Chengdu Plain.
    The flat basin quickly receded, and the road wound its way up the mountain slopes. The car circled around the mountain several times and reached the county seat of Tianquan in the evening.
    In 1935, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was on the Long March, one of the Red Army units passed through Tianquan. They established a people's government here and distributed the land of landlords and local bullies. Traces of slogans written at that time can still be seen on some of the walls. Many residents here participated in the peasant associations at that time, and they talked to me with great enthusiasm about that exciting era, their impressions so vivid as if everything had happened yesterday.
    Now, these members of the peasant associations from fifteen years ago have rejoined the associations. Land reform is underway here. It is said that each person can be allocated an average of two mu of paddy fields and one mu of dry land. Each mu of paddy field here can produce 350 jin of unhusked rice. The yield on the Chengdu Plain is twice as high as here, but the amount of land owned by farmers there is far less than here.
    Outside Tianquan in the evening, clusters of firelight could be seen, lit by passing Tibetan merchants. Generally, passing Han people would have already found a hotel on the street at this time, but those Tibetan merchants from the western plateau continued on their way. They casually found a place with water by the roadside to unload their livestock, and then gathered some branches to light a fire, which completed the preparations for the night's lodging and cooking. They carried ghee, tea, "tsampa," and beef with them, so there was no need to go out to buy anything temporarily. What I saw seemed to be a whole family, including three women and a child. After eating and drinking, each person stuffed their bowl and the remaining beef into their bosom, casually fell down around the fire, and one by one drifted into sweet dreams.
    We continued on from Tianquan, and we encountered more and more Tibetan merchants along the way. Each group of such merchants carried several horses, those coming from the west loaded with medicinal herbs, and those returning from the east loaded with brick tea. Each of them was so strong and healthy, it was hard to find one who was hunchbacked. When they saw our large convoy of cars speeding past them, they often forgot about their surprised horses, which happily jumped around. Here I heard the singing of many musical geniuses, using the unique high-pitched and melodious voices of the plateau pastures, singing moving mountain songs one after another. I once asked a comrade who understood Tibetan to translate the meaning of a song for me. The lyrics of that song were like this:
    "Chairman Mao's troops came to our village,
    The dark Ula system was swept away,
    Today,
    We can ride our own horses,
    Happily riding to the city to buy things."
    The car stopped at a small town at the foot of Erlang Mountain to rest. The driver crawled under the car to check the engine, preparing for the mountain crossing.
    We wound our way up the northern slope of Erlang Mountain. What first caught our eyes was the vast and boundless primitive forest covering the mountains and valleys. Pine trees and fir trees seemed to have laid a layer of emerald velvet on this ten-thousand-foot-high mountain. Our motherland is so magnificent, it cannot help but evoke a sense of pride. The road we initially took uphill was a bit muddy, but halfway up the mountain, the ground had already solidified into hard ice. Ice columns as long as ten feet hung down from the cliffs like sharp teeth. The car revved up its engine and climbed upwards again. White snow covered everything. The trees could not be seen with branches or leaves. From a distance they looked like silver spires. Before going up the mountain, the driver had told me that you could see the different scenery of spring, summer, autumn and winter from this mountain. Now it was indeed true.
    We climbed to the top of the mountain and looked back at the road we had traveled, winding around like a tangled mess. At this time, I really didn't know how the car had squeezed through. Only by coming here can one gain a deeper understanding of the hardships and difficulties the People's Liberation Army encountered when building the road on this mountain. Now those heroes who opened up this high mountain have taken the rich experience they gained here to move further forward. They left the four large characters "贯通康藏" [Guantong Kangzang - Opening up Kangzang (Xikang and Tibet)] on the top of Erlang Mountain, which were written on a wooden archway. When we passed this archway, our hearts were filled with admiration.
    On the northern slope of Erlang Mountain, dark clouds hung low in the sky, but after crossing the summit, it immediately turned into a clear sky with not a cloud in sight, and the sun shone brightly. The barrier of high mountains has such a significant impact on climate change. On the southern side of Erlang Mountain, because the climate is dry, trees are rarely seen. The weeds are also not as lush as on the northern side of the mountain. We spiraled down the bare mountainside for about three or four hours and arrived at the historically significant Dadu River.
    Seeing this clear and jade-like Dadu River, deeply embedded in the valley, one cannot help but feel admiration for the revolutionary heroes from the bottom of one's heart. The cause of our people's revolution has experienced such a difficult road, and our heroic army has overcome such serious difficulties! Although the Dadu River appears to be only about a hundred meters wide, because it flows through deep mountain valleys, the water flows especially fast and the impact is particularly strong. We used wooden sticks to probe into the water for testing, and we could not make them vertical even with all our strength. This is a river that is not easy to swim across to the other side, and it is even impossible to build a bridge. This natural barrier once caused Shi Dakai's entire army to be wiped out here a hundred years ago. In 1936, the reactionary army of the Kuomintang also wanted to rely on this natural barrier to block the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the Long March, but the will of the people's revolution could not be stopped, and the Red Army crossed the Dadu River.
    We crossed the Luding Iron Chain Bridge, which the Red Army forced across in the past, and reached the west bank of the Dadu River. Here, Mao Zedong's poem about the Red Army's forced crossing of the Dadu River is engraved on the stone cliffs. It was carved last year by the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet. We all stopped the cars and recited it repeatedly, our hearts filled with unspeakable reverence.

### 到西康去

    到西康去
    新华社记者  千峰
    去年十二月下旬，我在四川旅行刚刚结束，这时恰好有一批军车开往甘孜，于是决定趁着这个机会，到西康高原上去看看。
    早晨从成都出发，下午两点多钟便到了西康省会雅安。这里和四川只有一山之隔，周边环绕着丛山，中间是一块富庶的盆地。我们从盆地正中穿过，眼睛里出现着一个个隐蔽在竹林里的小小村庄，在温暖阳光下盛开着蓝色花朵的蚕豆田，阡陌纵横的稻田。几乎使人看不出和成都平原上有什么区别。
    平坦的盆地很快地过去，公路蜿蜒着爬上了山坡。汽车在山?里兜了几个圈子，傍晚时分到达天全县城。
    一九三五年中国工农红军长征时，有一路红军曾经路过天全。并且在这里建立了人民政权，和分配了地主豪绅的土地。如今有的墙壁上还留着当时写过标语的痕迹。这里很多居民都曾参加过当时的农会，他们兴致勃勃地给我谈着那个轰轰烈烈的时代，印象的深刻好像一切昨天才发生一样。
    现在这些十五年前的农会会员，又重新加入了农会。这里正进行着土地改革。据说平均每人可以分到二亩稻田和一亩旱地。此地每亩稻田可产三百五十市斤黄谷，成都平原上的产量比这里要高出一倍，但那里农民所占有的土地数量却远不如这里多。
    傍晚的天全城外可以看到一簇一簇的火光，那是过路的藏商所点燃的。一般过路的汉人，到了这时早已在街上找定了旅店，但那些西边高原上来的藏族商人，却继续前进着。他们随便在路边找个有水的地方将牲口卸下，然后拾上几根树枝点起火来，这就完成了晚上住宿和做饭的准备。他们随身携带着酥油、茶叶、“藏粑”和牛肉，因此一切东西都用不到临时上街去买。我看到的好像是一个全家，其中有三个妇女和一个孩子。他们吃喝完毕，每人把饭碗和剩下的牛肉向着怀里一塞，随便围着火堆一倒，便一个个进入甜蜜的梦乡了。
    我们从天全继续前进，路上遇到的藏商越来越多。每一帮这样的藏商都带着若干马匹，从西边来的驮着药材，从东边回去的驮着陀茶，一个个身体都是那样的矫健，百个之中也很难看到一个弯腰驼背的。他们看到我们这大队的汽车从身旁驰过，往往忘了那些吃惊的马匹欢乐得跳跃起来。在这里我听到了许多天才音乐家的歌唱，他们用着那种高原牧场上特有的高亢和婉转的声音，一个接一个地唱着动人的山歌。我曾经请一个懂藏话的同志把一首歌的意思翻译给我听，那首歌的歌词是这样：
    “毛主席的队伍来到我们的村，
    黑暗的乌拉制度一扫净，
    到今天，
    自己的马儿才能自己骑，
    欢欢喜喜地骑到城里去买东西。”
    汽车停在二郎山脚下一个小镇上休息，司机爬在车下检查机件，这是翻越大山的准备。
    我们从二郎山的北麓蜿蜒而上。首先跃入眼帘的是满山满谷辽阔无边的原始大森林，松树、杉树，好像给这万丈高山铺了一层碧绿的绵绒。我们祖国是这样富丽，不由得使人发生一种自骄的心情。我们起初上山的道路有些泥泞，但到半山腰，地上已经凝结成坚硬的冰块，长达丈许的冰柱，从悬崖上像一个个锐利的牙齿下垂着。汽车开足了马力再向上爬，白雪覆盖了一切，树木看不见枝叶，远远看去倒像一座座银色的尖塔。上山以前司机曾告我说，从这一座山上可以看到春夏秋冬四季不同的景色，现在果真不错。
    我们爬到了山顶，回头看看所走过的公路，像一把乱丝似地盘来盘去，这时真不知道汽车是怎样钻出来的。解放军进藏部队修筑这座大山上的公路时，经过了多少艰苦和困难，只有到了这里才能得到更深刻的体会。现在那些打通了这座高山的英雄们，已经带着从这里取得的丰富经验到更前面去了，他们在这个拔海两千五百公尺的二郎山顶上留下了“贯通康藏”四个大字，那是写在一个木头牌坊上的，我们经过这个牌坊的时候，衷心的充满着敬佩。
    在二郎山的北麓，天空里低低地压着乌云，但翻过山顶，即刻变成了一个万里无云的晴空，太阳明朗地照耀着。高山的壁障，对于气候的变化是发生着如此显著的影响。二郎山的南面，因为气候干燥，很少看见树木。杂草也不如山的北面茂盛。我们顺着光秃秃的山坡盘旋而下，约摸三四个钟头，到了富有历史意义的大渡河畔。
    看到这个深陷在夹谷里的清碧如带的大渡河，不由人从内心里发出对于革命英雄们的景仰。我们人民革命的事业曾经经历过了这样艰难的道路，我们英雄的军队曾经战胜了这样严重的困难！大渡河的河身，虽然看来只不过宽达百米左右，但因为它在深山夹谷中流过，水的流速特别大，冲击力也特别强。我们曾用木棍探到水里试验，用尽了气力都不能使它垂直。这是一个不容易横游到对岸的河流，更无法安桩架桥。这个天险，一百年前曾经使得石达开在这里全军覆没。一九三六年，国民党的反动军队也想凭借着这个天险来阻挡长征中的工农红军，但人民革命的意志是阻挡不住的，红军渡过了大渡河。
    我们穿过当年红军强渡的泸定铁索大桥，到达大渡河的西岸。这里石崖上刻着毛主席当年咏红军强渡大渡河的诗，是去年人民解放军进藏部队刻制的。我们全体停下车来翻复诵读着，心里带着说不出的崇敬。
