Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th: General Mark W. Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, sent a letter (attached) to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, on June 11th, providing an unreasonable justification for the U.S. representatives' rude and provocative walkout. The spokesperson of the Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following statement to reporters regarding this matter:

    In his reply, General Clark, fully aware that everything stated in Generals Kim and Peng's letter of June 9th to him was undeniable truth, stubbornly described the rude provocations as "commendable" "patience," because the various rude and provocative actions taken by the U.S. representatives in the negotiations were his own proposals. At the same time, he had to admit that this rude and provocative "negotiation style" was "fully approved" by him. Then, General Clark incorrectly stated that "there is no understanding or precedent requiring daily meetings." This statement obviously ignores the facts of the Korean armistice negotiations over the past year. The entire record of the armistice negotiations proves precisely that daily meetings were the understanding and frequently existing precedent in the negotiations, and that in the past, meetings were held daily without interruption, except when both sides agreed, or when the U.S. side deliberately created incidents to make the meetings impossible. This time, the U.S. side adjourned the meeting unilaterally without agreement, which is precisely a violation of the understanding and precedent that meetings must be held daily. This proves that the U.S. side has adopted an extremely unreasonable and extremely irresponsible attitude towards the armistice negotiations that the world is concerned about.

    As the world knows, the U.S. delegation, headed by Harrison, adopted a rogue-like "negotiation style" in the meeting hall because they were at a loss for words. They engaged in trivial acts such as whistling, pretending to sleep, and leaving the meeting without permission before it was over, treating the extremely serious negotiation meeting as child's play. More seriously, they refused to answer questions, proposed indefinite adjournments every day, and finally walked out of the meeting midway, unilaterally interrupting the negotiations, in order to escape the embarrassment of facing the truth. All of this is what General Clark called "commendable" "patience," but it is a rude and provocative act that the people of the world cannot tolerate.

    In his reply, General Clark also attempted to dismiss the U.S. crimes of massacring prisoners of war with the words "malicious slander." However, these crimes of the U.S. side have already been confessed by Colson, the former commander of the Geojedo prisoner-of-war camp. And Colson's confession was published in a public statement by General Clark himself. Since then, a series of new massacres of our captured personnel by the U.S. side have been publicly announced by the "United Nations Command Headquarters" or the "U.S. Eighth Army Headquarters." Just one day before General Clark's reply (June 10th), the U.S. side killed more than 30 of our captured personnel and wounded more than 130 seriously and over 100 lightly in Geojedo again, and the whole world knows these facts. Even General Clark, in his letter, could not help but attempt to blur and cover up these facts by admitting that they were "half true and half false." However, the same General Clark, after admitting that these facts are "half true and half false," wants to use the statement "malicious slander" to cover up these blood cases created by the U.S. side, which will forever be in vain.

    General Clark further stated that the United Nations Command delegation will only "come to meetings" when it is "practically feasible." This fully proves that the U.S. side is still trying to continue to delay and disrupt the negotiations. Because in the negotiations, as long as the U.S. side adopts a consultative attitude and solves the only remaining issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation in the armistice negotiations according to the agreements already reached by both sides, then negotiations can make "practically feasible" progress at any time. However, now the U.S. side is still refusing to reason, refusing to negotiate, and even trying to refuse to meet again. Under such circumstances, the responsibility for the failure of the negotiations to achieve "practically feasible" progress lies entirely with the U.S. side.

    According to past understandings between the two sides, official letters should be published in full. However, in order to avoid facing the serious accusations raised in Generals Kim and Peng's letter of June 9th, and in order to cover up the truth from the people of the world, General Clark withheld Generals Kim and Peng's letter and refused to publish it, hoping to cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand in order to delay the problem and not solve it. This is also a cowardly manifestation of the U.S. side's fear of facing the truth and facts.

    We believe that in order to solve the only remaining issue in the negotiations and to achieve the long-awaited Korean armistice as soon as possible, the normal conduct of the meeting is absolutely necessary. The Korean-Chinese side will resolutely oppose the U.S. side's unilateral interruption of the negotiations in any form, and will insist on resolving the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation through consultation in accordance with the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and quickly realize the Korean armistice. The rude and provocative actions of the U.S. side will never achieve the goals they are pursuing.

    Attached: Clark's letter to General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    The representatives of the United Nations Command have for many days endured the malicious accusations made by your side in the general assembly, which are based on distorted and half-true facts for propaganda purposes only. Their patience has been commendable at all times, and their manner of conducting negotiations has my full approval. There is no understanding or precedent requiring daily meetings. If any delegation, for its own reasons, wishes to adjourn until a day later, the other delegation has no reason to object unduly, unless it has a new proposal to offer that provides a possibility of making substantial progress towards an armistice. Your delegation has made no such proposal. The United Nations Command delegation has been and will continue to come to meetings when it is practically feasible, and at any time that your delegation gives a positive indication that there is hope of making progress towards achieving an honorable armistice. The United Nations Command delegation will be prepared at all times to have members of the delegation explain to you the methods proposed in our April 28th proposal. My delegation will be prepared at all times to discuss with your delegation any fair and aboveboard method that will guarantee that none of the prisoners of war on either side will be forcibly repatriated against their freely expressed will.

### 朝中代表团发言人发表谈话  驳斥克拉克为美方代表中途退会的挑衅举动所作的无理辩解

    朝中代表团发言人发表谈话
    驳斥克拉克为美方代表中途退会的挑衅举动所作的无理辩解
    【新华社开城十四日电】联合国军总司令克拉克将军于六月十一日以复函一件（附后）致朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军及中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，为美方代表中途退会的无礼挑衅举动作毫无理由的辩解。朝中代表团发言人特就此事对记者发表谈话如下：
    克拉克将军在他的复函中，明知金、彭两将军六月九日致克拉克将军信中所述的一切是无可辩驳的真理，但由于美方代表在谈判中所采取的种种无礼的挑衅行动，就是克拉克将军自己的主张，所以他就硬将无礼的挑衅说成是“可嘉的”“忍耐”，而同时，又不得不承认这种无礼挑衅的“谈判方式”是得到他“完全批准”的。接着，克拉克将军更错误地说“没有谅解或前例需要每天开会”。他这种说法显然是抹煞了朝鲜停战谈判一年来经过的事实。停战谈判的全部记录恰恰证明：每天开会正是谈判中的谅解和经常存在的前例，而在过去，除了经过双方协议，或美方故意制造事件使会议无法进行之外，会议是每天都在进行从未间断的。美方这次不经协议而擅自休会，才恰恰是破坏每天必须开会的谅解和前例。这证明美方对举世关心的停战谈判采取了极端无理、极端不负责任的态度。
    世所共知，以哈利逊为首的美国代表团，因为理屈词穷，就在会议席上采取了无赖的“谈判方式”，小如吹口哨，假装睡觉，未等开会完毕就擅自离席，把极端严肃的谈判会议视同儿戏；大如拒绝回答问题，天天提议无限期休会；最后更中途退会，片面中断谈判，以逃避面对真理的窘境。这一切，就是克拉克将军所说的“可嘉的”“忍耐”，而却是全世界人民所不能容忍的无礼挑衅的举动。
    在他的复信中，克拉克将军又企图把美方屠杀战俘的罪行，用“恶意的诬控”几个字一笔勾销。但是美方这些罪行是巨济岛前任战俘营长官柯尔生早已供认的。而柯尔生的这一供状，正是在克拉克将军本人的一篇公开声明里发表的。这以后美方对我方被俘人员所进行的一系列新的屠杀又都是“联合国军总部”或“美国第八军司令部”公开发布的。就在克拉克将军复信的前一天（六月十日），美方在巨济岛再度杀死我方被俘人员三十余人，打伤一百三十余人，轻伤一百余人，全世界也都知道这些事实。甚至克拉克将军在他的来信中都不能不企图用承认这些事实是“半真半假”来加以模糊和掩盖。可是同一个克拉克将军在承认这些事实是“半真半假”之后，竟又想用“恶意的诬控”的说法，来掩盖美方一手制造的这些血案，这将永远是徒劳的。
    克拉克将军更表示，联合国军代表团只将在“实际可行”时，才“前来开会”。这完全证明美方仍在企图继续拖延谈判和破坏谈判。因为在谈判中只要美方采取协商态度，根据双方已经达成的协议来解决停战谈判剩下的唯一的战俘遣返问题，则任何时间都可使谈判取得“实际可行”的进展。可是，现在美方仍在拒绝说理，拒绝协商，甚至企图再次拒绝开会。在这样情形之下，谈判之不能得到“实际可行”的进展，其责任完全在于美方。
    根据双方过去的谅解，双方来往公函应该予以全文发表。而克拉克将军为了害怕面对金、彭两将军六月九日去信中所提出来的严正指责，为了在世界人民面前掩盖问题真相，竟将金、彭两将军的去信扣留不予发表，希图以一手掩尽天下人的耳目，以便其拖延问题，不加解决。这也是美方畏惧面对真理和事实的怯弱表现。
    我们认为：为要解决谈判中的唯一剩余问题，以早日实现举世切盼的朝鲜停战，会议的正常进行，是绝对必要的。朝中方面将坚决反对美方在任何形式下所采取的片面中断谈判的举动，并将坚持按照一九四九年日内瓦公约的原则，协商解决战俘遣返问题，迅速实现朝鲜停战。美方的无礼挑衅的举动，将永远不能达到他们所追求的目的。
    附：克拉克来信朝鲜人民军金日成最高司令官中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员：
    联合国军的代表们已多日忍受你方在大会上仅是为了宣传目的，根据歪曲和半真半假的事实而提出的恶意的诬控。他们的忍耐在一切时候都是可嘉的，他们进行谈判的方式得到我完全的批准。没有谅解或前例需要每天开会。如果任何一方代表团由于它本身的理由愿意休会至次日以后，另一代表团没有理由不适当地加以反对，除非它要提出新方案，这个新方案系提供向停战作实质进展的可能性的。你们的代表团并没有提出这样的方案。联合国军代表团已经并将继续在实际可行时前来开会，并在你们的代表团作出肯定表示，有希望向达成光荣停战作进展的任何时候前来开会。联合国军代表团将在一切时候准备由代表团人员来向你们解释我方四月二十八日方案所提出的办法。我的代表团将准备在一切时候和你们的代表团研讨任何光明正大的方法，这种方法将保证双方的战俘没有一个被违背其自由表示的意志而遭强迫遣返。
    联合国军总司令美国陆军上将马克·Ｗ·克拉克
    一九五二年  六月十一日
