    Chinese Nursing Association Congratulates the Opening of Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital

    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese Nursing Association wrote a letter on June 21st to the Soviet medical workers of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, congratulating the hospital on its opening in Beijing. The full text of the original letter is as follows: Dear Soviet medical worker comrades:

    First of all, the Chinese Nursing Association, on behalf of all nurses in China, extends heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet Red Cross Hospital.

    The opening of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital is another concrete manifestation of cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, and a major event in promoting China's health construction. This fully demonstrates the noble internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and their concern for the people of our country. Although modern nursing work in China has a history of more than one hundred years, it was completely monopolized by Anglo-American imperialists in the past. With the liberation of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the level of awareness of our country's nurses has been raised. They have recognized that American imperialism, under the guise of science and technology, established hospitals and nursing schools in the past entirely to achieve its goal of carrying out cultural aggression against our country, and numbing and enslaving our people. Therefore, we must thoroughly eliminate it.

    Today, our great friend, the Soviet people, with a sincere and selfless spirit, have established the Soviet Red Cross Hospital in our country's capital, and sent thirty-seven Soviet medical workers to relieve the pain of diseases for our working people, train medical workers, and introduce advanced Soviet experience. In this way, the Soviet Union has once again given us significant assistance in medical and health construction. The Soviet Red Cross Hospital will be a banner for our country's medical institutions. All of us nursing workers are determined to learn from the achievements of advanced Soviet medicine, strengthen the connection between Soviet nursing workers and us, and sincerely hope that you will continue to provide academic and experiential guidance.

    We wish all comrades of your hospital good health.

    Chinese Nursing Association

    中华护士学会贺北京苏联红十字医院开幕
    【本报讯】中华护士学会于六月二十一日写信给北京苏联红十字医院的苏联医务工作者，祝贺该院在北京开幕。原信全文如下：亲爱的苏联医务工作者同志们：
    首先，中华护士学会代表全中国的护士，向苏联红十字医院致以衷心的祝贺。
    北京苏联红十字医院的开幕，是中苏两国文化交流的又一具体表现，是推进中国卫生建设的一件大事。这充分表现了苏联人民的崇高国际主义精神和苏联人民对我国人民的关怀。我们中国的近代护理工作虽然有了一百多年的历史，但过去完全是被英美帝国主义者所垄断的。随着中国的解放，我国护士们在共产党和毛主席的领导下，觉悟程度提高了，认识了美帝国主义过去打着科学技术的幌子，开办医院和护士学校，完全是为了达到它对我国进行文化侵略，麻痹和奴役我国人民的目的。所以我们要彻底消灭它。
    今天我们伟大的友人苏联人民，以赤诚无私的精神，在我国的首都开办了苏联红十字医院，并派来苏联三十七位医务工作同志，为我国劳动人民解除疾病痛苦，训练医务工作人员，并介绍苏联的先进经验。这样，苏联在医药卫生建设方面，再一次给了我们重大的援助。苏联红十字医院将是我国医疗机关的一面旗帜，我们全体护理工作者，决心学习苏联先进医学的成就，加强苏联护理工作者和我们之间的联系，并诚恳地希望你们不断地给予学术上经验上的指导。祝贵院全体同志健康
    中华护士学会
    一九五二年六月二十一日
