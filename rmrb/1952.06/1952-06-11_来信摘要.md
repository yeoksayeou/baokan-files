    Letter Summary
    Suggestion to Organize Waterborne Women by the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation
    Shanghai has a waterborne population of fifty to sixty thousand, including more than twenty thousand women. They urgently request to participate in various related organizations, but until now, the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation has not organized them.
    According to my understanding, the waterborne women of Shanghai bear a heavy labor burden in shipping work. Before liberation, they were directly subjected to the insults and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, feudal forces, and imperialist navies. After liberation, the people of the entire city have improved politically and culturally; however, the waterborne women have progressed slowly due to their frequent dispersed and mobile state, and lack of organization and leadership.
    For the sake of the motherland's production and construction cause, and for the complete liberation of waterborne women, I believe that organizing them, raising their political awareness, and giving play to their labor enthusiasm is very necessary. I suggest that the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation dispatch appropriate cadres, study proper methods according to the special circumstances on the water, and quickly organize them.

    Suggestion to Publish a Large Number of Popular Books and Newspapers with Phonetic Symbols
    The "Quick Literacy Method" using phonetic symbols for teaching has achieved good results in experiments in troops, factories, and rural areas across the country. This is one of the most effective ways to improve the cultural level of the working people. However, in the process of quick learning, "discarding crutches" and consolidating the already mastered new characters is a relatively difficult step in both teaching and learning. In order to facilitate the vast number of working people in consolidating the new characters they have learned in crash courses and to meet their needs for improving various kinds of knowledge, it is very necessary to publish a large number of popular books and newspapers with phonetic symbols. I suggest that publishing departments in various regions pay attention to solving this problem.

    Nankou Water Supply Station Should Adjust Water Supply Time
    The town of Nankou on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway has tens of thousands of people, and the water supply station only has five or six water pipes, and the stipulated water carrying time is too short—6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., and no water is released after the time limit. In order to buy water, the townspeople have to get up early to line up, which delays production, so the masses are very dissatisfied. They said: "It doesn't matter to pay for water, but the time limit is too strict. Are they (referring to the water supply station) serving the people!" In order to facilitate the townspeople to buy water, it is suggested that the water supply station adjust the water supply time and system.

    Love of Children Has Become a New Morality in the New Society
    I live at 106 Dongzhimen Street, Beijing. At noon on May 3, my seven-year-old child, Zu Xin (Zǔ Xīn), fell into a roadside pool, injured his head, and was bleeding profusely. Comrade Wang Zhongsheng (Wáng Zhòngshēng) of a certain unit of the People's Public Security Forces passed by and picked up the child from the pool and sent him to the hospital to register for "emergency treatment." After I arrived at the hospital, Comrade Wang Zhongsheng described the circumstances of the child's injury to me, handed the child over to me, and was about to leave. I offered him money for the ride, but he refused. I thanked him, and he sincerely said: "This is my duty. Children are our second generation, and we should take good care of them." Now, my child has gradually recovered.
    This incident really moved me. I realize that love of children has become a new morality in the new society.

    Workers and Shop Assistants in Taiyuan Unite with Capitalists to Actively Produce
    After the "Five-Anti" Movement, the workers and shop assistants in Taiyuan actively engaged in production and urged the capitalists to operate in accordance with the law. Some capitalists in private cotton weaving factories used to be greedy for exorbitant profits, and an average of 15 to 20 percent of the cloth they processed was substandard. Now, under the supervision of the workers, the quality of the cloth has been greatly improved. The cloth woven by workers with good skills has exceeded the standard. The workers of Dongshengtai (Dōngshēngtài) Iron Factory saw that the deadline for delivering water carts was approaching, so they took the initiative to urge the capitalists to prepare materials and work overtime.
    Before the "Five-Anti" Movement, Yong'an (Yǒng'ān) Flour Mill produced very poor quality goods that could not be sold. Now, the shop assistants study their work and turn the substandard flour into good flour, and the output has increased from four jars to six jars per day. Because the goods are good, the goods produced every day are not enough to sell, which has increased the enthusiasm of the capitalists to operate. The capitalists have adjusted wages, improved meals, and established a meeting system. The workers said: "In the past, the capitalists did everything themselves and did not rely on us; now they have begun to implement democratic management, and production will definitely develop."

    来信摘要
    建议上海市民主妇联把水上妇女组织起来
    上海市的水上人口有五、六万人，其中妇女有两万多人。她们迫切地要求参加各种有关的组织，但直到现在，上海市民主妇女联合会还没有把她们组织起来。
    根据我的了解，上海市的水上妇女，在航运工作中，担负着沉重的劳动。解放前，她们直接受着国民党反动政府、封建势力和帝国主义海军的侮辱与压迫；解放后，全市的人民在政治上文化上都提高了；但水上的妇女们由于经常处在分散流动的状况下，并且缺乏组织和领导，因而进步较慢。
    为了祖国的生产建设事业，为了彻底解放水上妇女，我认为，把她们组织起来，提高她们的政治觉悟，发挥她们的劳动热情，是非常必要的。我建议上海市民主妇女联合会派遣适当的干部，按照水上的特殊情况，研究妥善办法，迅速把她们组织起来。

    建议大量出版带注音符号的通俗书报
    利用注音符号教学的“速成识字法”，在全国各地部队、工厂、农村中实验，都得到了良好的成绩。这是提高劳动人民文化水平的最有效办法之一。但是，在速成教学过程中，“丢拐棍”巩固已经突击学会的生字，在教与学两方面都是比较困难的一步。为了便利广大劳动人民巩固已经突击学会的生字，满足他们提高各种知识的要求，大量出版带有注音符号的通俗书报是非常必要的。我建议各地出版部门，注意解决这个问题。

    南口给水站应调整给水时间
    京绥道上的南口镇有一万数千人，给水站只有五、六处给水管，且规定的担水时间太短——上午六时至十时，下午十二时至四时，逾时不再放水。镇民为了买水，不能不起早去站队，以致耽误生产，所以群众很不满意。他们说：“花钱买水没关系，时间限制太厉害，他们（指给水站）那是为人民服务呀！”为便利镇民们买水，建议给水站调整给水时间和制度。

    爱护儿童已成为新社会的新道德
    我住在北京市东直门大街一○六号。五月三日中午，我七岁的孩子祖新跌入路旁一水池内，头部受伤，血流满面。人民公安部队某部王仲生同志路过该处，就将孩子从水池中抱起，送入医院挂“急诊号”医治。我赶到医院后，王仲生同志向我叙述了孩子跌伤的情形，把孩子交给我，就要走。我还他车钱，他也不要。我向他道谢，他诚恳地说：“这是我应尽的责任。儿童是我们的第二代，我们应该好好地爱护他们。”现在，我的小孩已经逐渐痊愈了。
    这件事实在使我感动。我认识到爱护儿童已经成为新社会的新道德。

    太原市工人店员团结资本家积极生产
    太原市的工人、店员，在“五反”运动后，积极进行生产，督促资本家守法经营。有些私营棉织厂的资本家，过去贪图暴利，他们加工的布匹，平均有百分之十五到二十不合格。现在，在工人的督促下，布的质量已大为提高。技术好的工人织出的布，已经超过了标准。东生泰铁工厂的工人看见交水车的期限快到了，就主动督促资本家准备材料，并加班赶活。
    永安粉坊在“五反”运动以前，出的货很次，卖不出去。现在，店员们研究业务，把次粉改为好粉，产量还由每天四缸增加到六缸。因为货好，每天所出的货都不够卖，这就提高了资本家经营的积极性。资本家调整了工资，改善了伙食，还订立了开会制度。工人们说：“过去资本家一手包办，不依靠我们；现在开始实行民主管理，生产是一定可以发展的。”
