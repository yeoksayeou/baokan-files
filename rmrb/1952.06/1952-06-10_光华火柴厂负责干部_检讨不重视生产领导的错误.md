    Guanghua Match Factory Responsible Cadre
    Self-Criticism for Neglecting Production Leadership Errors
    Editor: In the People's Daily "Reader Letters" column on March 23rd, a reader's letter criticized the leading cadres of our factory for having serious bureaucratic work styles and neglecting leadership over production. I sincerely accept this criticism.

    In June of last year, our factory had a stock of over 4,000 sets of veneer panels. Based on the general output at the time, these veneer panels were sufficient for the second half of the year; however, I neglected the increased usage during the fourth quarter when production increased. In December, after I discovered this problem, I purchased 3,000 sets of old veneer panels from the Guandong Company. These old goods were of poor quality, and the daily consumption doubled. In January of this year, our factory borrowed 500 sets of veneer panels from the Sanming Company, which were used up in a few days. After that, the production volume of our factory decreased daily, and the production plans for January and February were not completed. The reason for this error was that I underestimated the market situation. I subjectively believed that there would be no shortage and did not conduct in-depth investigations, but simply waited. This is a lesson, and I am determined to correct this error in the future.

    光华火柴厂负责干部
    检讨不重视生产领导的错误
    编辑同志：三月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了读者来信，批评我厂领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，不重视对于生产的领导。我诚恳地接受这一批评。
    去年六月，我厂库存夹立板四千多套。按当时一般产量计算，这些夹立板还足够下半年的需要；但我忽视了第四季度增产时增加的用量。到十二月份，我发现这个问题后，购买了关东公司旧存夹立板三千套。这些旧货品质低劣，每天消耗量增加了一倍。今年一月，我厂又借用三明公司的夹立板五百套，几天就用完了。此后我厂生产量日减，一、二月份生产计划没有完成。造成这一错误的原因，是我对市场情况估计不足。我主观地认为不至于缺货，又没有深入地去调查，只是一味地等待。这是一个教训，我今后决心改正这种错误。
