    Newspapers Should Fully Publicize Advanced Experiences in Agricultural Production
    Comrade Editor: The article "On Agricultural Technology Problems" written by Lysenko, published on page two of the People's Daily on May 14, powerfully criticized bourgeois and conservative ideologies in agricultural production. As far as I know, some cadres leading agricultural production still have more or less resistant attitudes towards the promotion of agricultural technology. They mistakenly believe that production is "rough work for farmers" and "doesn't require any technology; it's just however much you get." Last year, I heard a report in Beijing about the Soviet Union harvesting 1,976 jin of seed cotton per mu. When I returned to the Henan Province Agricultural Implement Station and told my colleagues, no one believed it. They said it was probably because Soviet mu were larger, otherwise it would be impossible. Last year, when the newspaper published the news of cotton-growing expert Qu Yaoli creating a new record for cotton production, many people were skeptical. They especially couldn't understand Qu Yaoli's advanced experience of implementing close planting and heavy fertilization of cotton. This is just as Lysenko pointed out: "Bourgeois scholars believe that production cannot be increased beyond a certain limit." These erroneous thoughts and theories have already hindered the promotion of advanced experiences. Therefore, I suggest that local newspapers, in addition to conducting in-depth criticism of these erroneous thoughts and theories, should also, in accordance with the spirit of Lysenko's statement that "we must arm ourselves with science; we must make production forever advance with the progress of technology and knowledge," correctly publicize and summarize the advanced agricultural technology experiences of the masses, and educate the broad masses of cadres and people, so that the movement for agricultural bumper harvests becomes a widespread mass movement.　Kou Qintian

    报纸要充分地宣传农业生产的先进经验
    编辑同志：五月十四日人民日报第二版发表的卢森科所写的“关于农业技术问题”一文，对农业生产中的资产阶级思想、保守思想作了有力的批判。据我所知，有些领导农业生产的干部，对农业技术的推广，还或多或少地存在着一些抵抗的情绪。他们错误地认为生产是“庄稼老粗活”，“不需要什么技术，该打多少就是多少”。我去年在北京听了苏联每亩收一千九百七十六斤籽棉的报告，回到河南省农具总站，告诉别的同志们，当时就没有人相信，他们说大概是因为苏联亩大，否则是不可能的。去年报纸公布了植棉能手曲耀离创造棉花丰产新纪录的消息，有许多人半信半疑。他们特别对曲耀离实行棉花密植多肥的先进经验想不通。这正如卢森科所指出的：“资产阶级学者以为生产到了一定限度，就不能再增加。”这些错误的思想和理论，已经障碍了先进经验的推广。因此，我建议各地报纸除对这种错误的思想和理论，进行深刻的批判外，并应依据卢森科所说的“我们必须用科学来武装自己；我们要随着技术和知识的进步，使生产永远上进”的精神，正确地宣传和总结群众的农业技术先进经验，教育广大干部和群众，使农业丰产运动变成为广泛的群众运动。　寇勤田
