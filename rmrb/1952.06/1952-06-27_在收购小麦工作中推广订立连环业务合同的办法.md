    Promoting the Method of Concluding Serial Business Contracts in Wheat Procurement Work
    After the wheat harvest, the vast number of farmers urgently need to sell new wheat in exchange for essential means of subsistence and means of production. State-owned grain companies and other state-owned trading departments should purchase large quantities of new wheat at this time and promote the sale of various industrial products. All state-owned trading departments should cooperate with cooperatives to jointly complete this major task.
    The serial business contracts signed by the state-owned grain companies and other trading departments in southern and northern Anhui are a good way to leverage the collective strength of various state-owned trading departments to complete the task of wheat procurement and industrial product promotion. This kind of serial business contract systematically combines procurement and supply, enabling state-owned trading companies to supply farmers with daily necessities on the spot after procuring wheat. This facilitates farmers who sell wheat and purchase industrial products, ensures that various state-owned trading departments can complete their procurement and promotion tasks in a timely manner, and promotes the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This method should be promoted in the large-scale procurement of various agricultural products.
    When concluding serial business contracts, some grain companies have not yet closely cooperated with cooperatives, which is a shortcoming. State-owned trading companies must conclude serial business contracts with cooperatives in order to leverage the enormous power of the cooperatives and further facilitate farmers.

    在收购小麦工作中推广订立连环业务合同的办法
    麦收以后，广大农民急需出售新麦，换取必需的生活资料和生产资料。国营粮食公司和其他国营贸易部门，应该在这时候大量收购新麦，并推销各种工业品。各国营贸易部门应该和合作社互相配合，共同完成这一重大任务。
    皖南、皖北国营粮食公司和其他贸易部门订立的连环业务合同，是发挥各个国营贸易部门的集体力量，完成收购小麦和推销工业品任务的良好形式。这种连环业务合同，把收购和供应有计划地结合起来，使国营贸易公司在收购小麦后，能够当场供应农民日用必需品。这就便利了出售小麦和购买工业品的农民，保证了各国营贸易部门能够及时完成收购和推销的任务，也促进了城乡的物资交流。这种办法，在大规模收购各种农产品的工作中，都应该加以推广。
    在订立连环业务合同时，有些粮食公司还没有和合作社密切配合起来，这是一个缺点。国营贸易公司必须和合作社订立连环业务合同，以便发挥合作社的巨大力量，更加便利农民。
