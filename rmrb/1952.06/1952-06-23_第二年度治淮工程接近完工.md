    The spring phase of the second year of the Huai River project has achieved a decisive victory. As of the first half of June, over 90 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The entire spring project is more than 90% complete.
    Since the full-scale commencement of the Huai River project this spring in March, the construction period has lasted for more than three months, with the participation of 2 million civilian workers. Over the past three months, significant achievements have been continuously made on construction sites along the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River, and the Huai River basin is undergoing new and rapid changes. In Henan Province, the upper reaches of the Huai River, the main projects this spring were the continued construction of the Banqiao Reservoir and the Baisha Reservoir, and the management of the Hong River, Ru River, Ying River and other tributaries of the Huai River. Now, following the completion of the Banqiao Reservoir, the river management projects of the Hong River, Ru River and other rivers have also been completed successively at the beginning of this month. The Baisha Reservoir is currently rushing to complete the closure of the earthen dam. Except for the gate of the tunnel, all projects are expected to be basically completed by the end of June. In Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the Huai River, the foundation clearing work for the Foziling Reservoir project has been mostly completed. Site traffic is now being actively arranged, and it is about to enter the stage of pouring concrete. The diversion project of the main and tributary streams of the Huai River below Wuhe County has completed 9 million cubic meters of earthwork this spring. Together with the earthwork completed last winter, the entire project has completed 73.7%. Now, below Wuhe County, a new riverbed, 100 meters wide and 6.7 meters deep, has appeared through Fengshan. The unfinished part of the diversion project is planned to be continued this winter. The dredging and management projects of more than ten tributaries of the Huai River, such as the Xifei River, Tuo River, and Tang River, as well as the Menghe Depression and Wabuhu flood storage projects within Anhui Province, have all been completed, with a total earthwork of more than 30 million cubic meters. After the completion of the earthwork part of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the lower reaches of the Huai River, the Gaoliangjian water intake gate and the YunDong diversion gate on the Irrigation Main Canal are also about to be completed. The pouring of concrete has been basically completed, and the gates are being installed in a tense manner, striving to complete all projects by the end of June and release water in early July.
    With the victorious progress of the Huai River project, the 2 million civilian workers and workers participating in the project this spring see that the people in the Huai River basin are gradually moving from the abyss of disaster to a paradise of happiness. Therefore, their enthusiasm in construction has been unprecedentedly improved, and they have universally engaged in patriotic labor emulation campaigns. In the heated competition, they all paid attention to the improvement of labor organization and the improvement of working methods, making the general work efficiency greatly exceed the level of last winter. For example, the earthwork efficiency of Banqiao Reservoir and Baisha Reservoir in Henan Province has increased by an average of one time compared with last winter. In the Chonghe and Tonghe dredging projects in northern Anhui, the Huaiyuan County Huai River project model youth league member Zhu Huai Shun civilian worker team encountered seven rain and snowfalls in succession, and also overcame difficult works such as loess and quicksand, and over-fulfilled the task of 300 cubic meters of earthwork; During construction, they also created a set of advanced earthwork working methods. After the popularization of Zhu Huaiyuan's working method in various construction sites in northern Anhui, the work efficiency has been greatly improved. After learning this advanced method, 30,000 civilian workers in Lingbi County saved a total of 480,000 workdays. At the Gaoliangjian water intake gate construction site in northern Jiangsu, the concrete mixing machine workers doubled the efficiency of mixing concrete, ensuring the completion of pouring concrete on schedule.
    At present, the second year of the Huai River project is nearing completion. Various construction sites are actively preparing to evaluate merits, elect models, and prepare to reward those who have contributed to the second year of the Huai River project. (Xinhua News Agency)

    第二年度治淮工程接近完工
    第二年度治淮春季工程已获得决定性的胜利，到六月上半月止，已完成土工约九千多万公方；整个春季工程已完成百分之九十以上。
    今春治淮工程从三月份全面开工以来，施工时间共三个多月，参加的民工二百万人。三个多月来，淮河上、中、下游各处工地上都连续获得巨大的成绩，淮河流域的面貌正日新月异地发生新的变化。淮河上游河南省今春主要工程是继续修建板桥水库和白沙水库，整理洪河、汝河、颍河等淮河支流。现在继板桥水库的完工之后，洪河、汝河等河道整理工程也在本月初陆续完工。白沙水库目前正在突击土坝合龙的工程。除隧洞的闸门外，全部工程预计在六月底可基本完工。淮河中游皖北的佛子岭水库工程，清基工程已大部做好，现正积极布置工地交通工作，即将进入浇灌混凝土阶段。五河县以下的淮河干、支流分流工程，今春已完成土工九百万公方，连同去冬所作土方，全部工程已完成百分之七十三点七。现在五河县以下已出现了一条穿过峰山的一百公尺宽、六点七公尺深的新河床。分流工程还没有完成的部分，准备今冬继续施工。现在皖北境内的西淝河、沱河、唐河等十多条淮河支流的疏浚整理工程，以及濛河洼地、瓦埠湖蓄洪工程，土工都已全部结束，共作土方三千多万公方。淮河下游苏北灌溉总渠土工部分完工后，灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸和运东分水闸也快修成，现在浇灌混凝土已基本完工，正紧张安装闸门，争取六月底结束全部工程，七月初放水。
    参加今春治淮工程的二百万民工和工人，随着治淮工程胜利进展，眼看淮河流域的人民正从灾难的深渊逐步走向幸福的乐园，因此他们在施工中积极性空前提高，普遍投入了爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。他们在热烈竞赛中，都注意了劳动组合的改进和工作方法的改良，使一般工作效率大大超过了去年冬季的水平。如河南省板桥水库和白沙水库的土工效率，平均比去冬提高一倍。皖北漴河、潼河疏浚工程中，怀远县治淮模范青年团员祝怀顺民工小队，先后遇到了七次雨雪，又战胜了黄土、流沙等难工，并超额完成土方三百公方的任务；施工中他们还创造出一套先进的土工工作方法。皖北各工地推广了祝怀远的工作法后，工作效率大为提高。灵璧县三万治淮民工学习了这个先进方法后，共节省了四十八万个工作日。苏北高良涧进水闸工地上，混凝土拌合机工人，把拌合混凝土的工作效率提高了一倍，保证按期完成了浇灌混凝土。
    目前，第二年度治淮工程已接近完工，各工地正积极筹备评功、选举模范，准备奖励第二年度治淮有功的人员。　　　（新华社）
