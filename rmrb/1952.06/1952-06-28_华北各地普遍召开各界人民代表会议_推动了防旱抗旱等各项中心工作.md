People's representative conferences were universally held in the 330 counties and equivalent administrative units in North China during March and April of this year, effectively uniting the broad masses of people and promoting various central tasks.

After the First North China County Heads Conference last September, North China transmitted and reported the content and spirit of the conference's resolutions to cadres, organized study and discussion, enabling everyone to further recognize that "the People's Congress and People's Representative Conferences are the basic system of our country." Based on this, they reviewed and corrected their past erroneous ideas that People's Representative Conferences were "ineffective," "affect central work," and "not as effective as cadre meetings." This year, when the North China Administrative Committee deployed spring plowing, production, drought prevention, and disaster relief work to the provinces, it emphasized the necessity of universally convening people's representative conferences. These measures have led to a preliminary consensus among cadres at all levels regarding the understanding of People's Representative Conferences, thereby strengthening leadership over this work. For example, the Chairman of the Chahar Provincial People's Government and the heads of various departments and bureaus went to various counties to guide and assist in convening People's Representative Conferences. The leading organs of Hebei Province first convened a People's Representative Conference in Hejian County to create experience, and promptly communicated the local experience to the entire province. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office promptly criticized Xie County for merging the People's Representative Conference with an expanded cadre meeting and ordered the county to conduct a review. Before holding People's Representative Conferences, counties generally made more adequate preparations: publicizing the central content of the meeting to the masses, mobilizing representatives to widely collect various proposals, and paying attention to the purity and breadth of representative composition. During the meeting, there were fewer reports and more discussions. The responsible cadres of the county people's government listened to the opinions of the representatives with humility and earnestly handled the proposals, resulting in good results.

The People's Representative Conferences in the counties of North China, based on the instructions of the higher-level people's governments and the demands of the masses, convened meetings with the correct implementation of the policies of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the development of drought resistance, drought prevention, and spring plowing production as the central topics. Because the meetings were generally convened relatively timely and were better than in the past, the enthusiasm of the representatives was further enhanced, and the representatives enthusiastically put forward opinions in various aspects. The results of the meeting proved that the People's Representative Conference not only did not hinder the central work, but also powerfully promoted the current central work.

Through the People's Representative Conferences in various counties, various rumors that had once occurred in many places were first exposed, clarifying the confused thinking of some cadres and the masses, and stabilizing the mood for production and work. During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, because policies were not explained to district and village cadres in a timely manner, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, disseminating absurd rumors such as "Land reform struggles against landlords, Three-Anti struggles against cadres, struggling against cadres means struggling against the masses," and "Five-Anti is eating from the big pot," causing ideological confusion among many farmers and district and village cadres, adversely affecting production and work: some village cadres even left home to hide; some small vendors did not dare to enter the city to do business; and in individual places, there were also phenomena of farmers selling land for fear of struggle. In response to this situation, most counties in North China focused on explaining the policies of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements at the People's Representative Conferences, reiterated the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and explained that district and village cadres with corruption could be given lenient treatment as long as they actively led the masses in spring plowing production and made meritorious deeds. This shattered various rumors, dispelled the ideological concerns of the masses and district and village cadres, and enabled everyone to actively start production and work. Many village cadres, after hearing the report on the resolutions of the county People's Representative Conference, confessed their corruption and resolved to make meritorious deeds in leading the masses in drought prevention and production.

Second, most counties educated the delegates through general meetings, group discussions, and especially by organizing some representatives to introduce past experiences in overcoming disasters. This allowed them to recognize that "relying on heaven for rain" could only lead to "disaster upon disaster." They established the concept of "being prepared for unforeseen circumstances" and "man can conquer nature," and actively researched and discussed specific methods for drought resistance and prevention, and launched a drought resistance and prevention campaign after the meeting. For example, the original plan of Pingyuan Province was to dig 20,000 wells, but after discussion by the People's Representative Conferences in various counties, the result was increased to more than 42,000 wells.

Third, because patriotism education was generally carried out at the People's Representative Conferences in various counties, the political awareness of the representatives was raised, democracy was further promoted, and the responsible cadres of the county people's governments humbly listened to the opinions of the representatives. Therefore, the representatives put forward many revisions and supplements to the drought resistance and prevention and high-yield plans drafted by the government, making the entire plan more substantial and practical. For example, after detailed research and analysis of the government's proposed work plan based on the actual situation in the county, the People's Representative Conference of Xin County, Shanxi, revised the plan to build 82 small canals to 209. The People's Representative Conference of Lingshi County in the province also suggested that the government organize the masses to build 88 small canals. The People's Representative Conferences in various places have put forward many such constructive opinions. Issues such as converting dry land into paddy fields, agricultural implements and pesticides, organizing nurseries during the busy farming season, and substitute farming were all discussed by the People's Representative Conferences, supplementing the local production plans. The People's Representative Conferences in many counties also organized production model figures among the delegates to introduce high-yield experiences, targeting the conservative ideas of some delegates and masses, such as "production has reached its peak" and "it is difficult to harvest 100 shi of grain without planting 100 mu of land," which greatly increased the farmer representatives' confidence in improving the yield per unit area. For example, some representatives in Wuyuan County, Suiyuan Province, originally believed that the land in the county could not be fertilized, plowed, planted with trees, or planted with peas and lentils. However, after mutual enlightenment through general meetings and small meetings, they cleared their minds and unanimously agreed to hoe more, fertilize more, water more, and ensure that the average grain yield per mu of cultivated land in the county would increase by 15 jin this year.

Some counties also introduced the experience of typical mutual aid groups at the People's Representative Conferences, giving farmer representatives a further understanding of the direction of "organizing and gradually moving towards collectivization." Many farmer representatives excitedly said: Chairman Mao is leading us on a new road, no longer taking the old road of people exploiting people in the past; we will definitely reach a happy socialist society!

However, on the other hand, the leaders of the people's governments of a few counties have not seriously understood the spirit of the North China County Heads Conference, have not complied with the instructions of higher-level governments, and have still made excuses for fear of affecting the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements or other central work. They have failed to convene People's Representative Conferences on schedule or have still merged People's Representative Conferences with cadre meetings, and have not paid enough attention to the democratic rights of representatives and the handling of proposals, thereby reducing the role of the conference. This situation must be diligently changed.

    华北各地普遍召开各界人民代表会议
    推动了防旱抗旱等各项中心工作
    华北区的三百三十个县和相当于县的行政单位，都在今年三四月间召开了各界人民代表会议，有效地团结了广大人民，推动了各项中心工作。
    在去年九月华北第一次县长会议以后，华北各地都把这次会议的决议的内容和精神向干部作了传达报告，组织了学习、讨论，使大家进一步认识到“人民代表大会和人民代表会议是我们国家的基本制度”，并据此检讨和纠正了自己过去认为人民代表会议“不顶事”、“影响中心工作”以及“不如干部会起作用”等错误思想。今年华北行政委员会在向各省布置春耕、生产、防旱和救灾工作时，都强调了普遍召开各界人民代表会议的必要。这些措施，使各级干部对人民代表会议的认识初步趋于一致，因而加强了对这一工作的领导。例如察哈尔省人民政府主席和各厅长各局长曾分赴各县指导和协助召开各界人民代表会议。河北省领导机关则首先在河间县召开人民代表会议，创造经验，并及时将该地经验通报全省。山西省人民政府和运城专署对解县将人民代表会议和扩大干部会合并举行的错误，及时提出了批评，并责令该县做了检讨。各县在举行各界人民代表会议以前，一般都作了较为充分的准备工作：向群众宣传会议的中心内容，发动代表们广泛收集各种提案，注意了代表成分的纯洁和代表的广泛性。在会议期间，报告少，讨论多，县人民政府的负责干部虚心地听取了代表的意见，认真地处理了提案，使会议收到良好的效果。    华北各县的各界人民代表会议根据上级人民政府的指示和群众的要求，以正确贯彻执行“三反”和
    “五反”运动的政策，开展抗旱、防旱、春耕生产等为中心议题，召开会议。因会议一般召开得比较及时，而且比过去开得好，进一步发挥了代表们的积极性，代表们都热烈地提出了各方面的意见。会议的结果证明，人民代表会议不但没有妨碍中心工作，而且有力地推动了当前的中心工作。
    通过各县人民代表会议，首先揭穿了曾经一度在很多地方发生的各种谣言，使一部分干部和群众的混乱思想得以澄清，生产和工作情绪安定下来。在“三反”和“五反”运动期间，由于没有及时向区村干部交代政策，反革命分子和坏分子趁机造谣惑众，散布了所谓“土改斗地主，三反斗干部，反了干部反群众”，“五反就是吃大锅饭”等等无稽谣言，引起许多农民和区村干部的思想混乱，给生产和工作以不利影响：有的村干部甚至离家躲避；一些小商贩不敢进城作买卖；个别地方还出现了农民因怕斗争而出卖土地的现象。针对这种情况，华北大多数县份都在人民代表会议上着重地解释了“三反”和“五反”运动的政策，重申镇压反革命的政策，并且说明区村干部有贪污行为的，只要积极领导群众春耕生产，可以立功赎罪，取得宽大处理。这样便粉碎了各种谣言，解除了群众和区村干部的思想顾虑，使大家开始积极生产和工作。并有不少村干部在听了县人民代表会议决议的传达报告后，坦白了自己的贪污行为，决心在领导群众防旱生产中立功赎罪。
    第二，多数县份都通过大会报告，小组讨论，特别是组织某些代表介绍过去战胜灾荒的经验，教育了到会代表，使他们认识了“靠天等雨”只能“灾上加灾”，树立了“有备无患”和“人定胜天”的观念，积极地研究和讨论了抗旱防旱的具体办法，在会后领导群众展开了抗旱防旱运动。如平原省原计划打井两万眼，但经各县人民代表会议的讨论，结果增加到四万二千多眼。
    第三，由于各县一般都在人民代表会议上进行了爱国主义教育，提高了代表的政治觉悟，进一步发扬了民主，县人民政府的负责干部虚心听取了代表们的意见，因而代表们对政府草拟的抗旱防旱和丰产计划提出了许多修改和补充的意见，使整个计划更加充实和切合实际。如山西忻县人民代表会议根据全县的实际情况，对政府提出的工作计划作了详细的研究分析以后，把兴修小型水渠八十二道的计划改订为二百零九道。该省灵石县人民代表会议也建议政府组织群众兴修小型水渠八十八道。各地人民代表会议都提出了很多像这样的建设性的意见。如旱地变水地问题，农具、农药问题，组织农忙托儿所问题以及代耕问题等，都经人民代表会议讨论，补充了当地的生产计划。不少县的人民代表会议还针对一部分代表和群众的“生产到顶”、“不种百亩地，难打百石粮”等保守思想，组织到会代表中的生产模范人物介绍了丰产经验，大大地提高了农民代表对提高单位面积产量的信心。如绥远省五原县有的代表原来认为本县的土地不能上粪，不能行犁，不能种树，不能种豌豆、扁豆；但是经过大会小会互相启发以后，打通了思想，一致通过今年要多锄，多上粪，多浇地，保证全县每亩耕地平均多打粮食十五斤。
    有些县还在人民代表会议上介绍了典型互助组的经验，使农民代表对“组织起来，逐步走向集体化”的方向有了进一步的认识。许多农民代表兴奋地说：毛主席领导着我们走新道路，不再走过去人剥削人的老路；我们一定能走到幸福的社会主义社会！
    但另一方面，也还有少数县人民政府的领导人没有认真地体会华北县长会议的精神，不遵守上级政府的指示，仍然藉口恐怕影响“三反”“五反”运动或其他中心工作，而不按期召开人民代表会议，或者仍然把人民代表会议和干部会合并召开，对于代表的民主权利和提案的处理不够重视，因而减低了会议的作用。这种情形必须努力加以改变。
