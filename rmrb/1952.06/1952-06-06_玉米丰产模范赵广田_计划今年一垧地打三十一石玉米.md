Corn Abundance Model Zhao Guangtian
Plans to Harvest Thirty-One Shi of Corn Per Hectare This Year

To the Editor: Last spring, our village launched a red flag competition. At that time, I actively participated in this competition, and County Chief Zhang of the County People's Government personally helped me formulate a plan to achieve a yield of three shi of corn per mu. But at first, I thought that I had never heard of a mu of land producing so much corn. County Chief Zhang patiently said to me: As long as we can improve technology and break with conservative ideas, it is not a problem to produce so much corn. Only then did my confidence become firm. Unexpectedly, just as the seedlings emerged from the soil, we encountered a drought, so I carried water to irrigate the land all day long. Although carrying water made my shoulders swollen, I finally overcame the drought. I planted corn that was a hybrid of "Ma Yazi" and "Jin Dingzi." When the Ma Yazi corn just sprouted, comrades from the county agricultural science department came to help me study the method of artificial pollination to carry out corn hybridization. As a result, the corn grew very well, and one mu and four fen of land yielded three shi, eight dou, and one sheng of corn.

When I gloriously accepted the state award, all the villagers came to cheer and congratulate me. It was noon at this time, and the villagers from nearby villages didn't even bother to take a break, saying, "Quick, let's go see our farmers' 'crop champion'!" The villagers scrambled to touch my medal and certificate. Women's representative Zhai Suqing said: "This is so glorious! It's even happier than marrying a wife!" Old fellow Wang Fa said: "I must learn from you. This year our mutual aid group must also create a new record of high yield and compete with you."

I think that without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and the help of the people's governments at all levels, I could not have created a high-yield record with my personal strength. The above is the true story of my experience in creating a high corn yield. I am determined not to be arrogant or complacent, but to continue to improve yields continuously. This year, I have set aside another hectare of high-yield experimental land, and I guarantee to harvest thirty-one shi of corn from this hectare.

    玉米丰产模范赵广田
    计划今年一垧地打三十一石玉米
    编辑同志：去年春天，我村展开了红旗竞赛运动。当时我积极参加了这个竞赛，县人民政府张县长亲自帮助我制订了一亩打三石玉米的丰产计划。但是开始我寻思自古以来也没听说过一亩地能打这么多玉米，张县长耐心地对我说：只要能提高技术，打破保守思想，打这么多玉米是不成问题的。这时我的信心才坚定起来。不料小苗刚出土，就赶上天旱，我就整天挑水浇地，虽然挑水把肩头都压肿了，但到底战胜了旱灾。我种的是“马芽子”和
    “金顶子”杂交的玉米。马芽子玉米刚出蓼时，县农业科的同志就来帮我研究用人工授粉的办法实行玉米杂交，结果玉米果然长得很好，一亩四分地打了三石八斗一升玉米。
    当我光荣地接受国家奖励时，全村老乡都来欢呼祝贺。这时正是晌午，附近村的老乡也顾不得歇晌，都说：“快看咱庄稼人的‘庄稼状元’去！”老乡们争着摸我的奖章奖状，妇女代表翟素卿说：
    “这多么光荣啊！比娶媳妇都高兴！”王发老乡说：“我一定向你学习，今年我们互助组也一定要创造丰产新纪录，和你比一比。”
    我想，如果没有毛主席、共产党的领导，和各级人民政府的帮助，我个人力量是创不出丰产纪录的，我上面说的创玉米丰产经过就是事实。我决心不骄傲，不自满，要继续不断地提高产量。今年我又划出一垧丰产试验地，这垧地我保证打三十一石玉米。
