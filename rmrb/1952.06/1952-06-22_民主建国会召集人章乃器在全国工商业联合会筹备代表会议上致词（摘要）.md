Comrades of the Presidium, Representatives, and Comrades:

	This meeting is an unprecedented grand gathering in the history of China's industrial and commercial circles. Having gone through the great "Five-Anti" Movement and now participating in this grand meeting, I think our representatives of the industrial and commercial circles will all feel it is a great honor and of great significance.

	The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles is very great. From the perspective of the entire new country, it has basically eliminated the three evils and five poisons, cleared the obstacles to large-scale national construction, consolidated the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and ensured that the course of New Democracy does not take detours. From the perspective of industrialists and businessmen, through mass criticism and education in the "Five-Anti" struggle, and through self-ideological struggle, they have recognized their negative and positive aspects, recognized their bright future, recognized the greatness of the power of the masses, recognized the great spirit of the working class, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government in combining magnanimity and seriousness, public-mindedness, and goodwill towards others, and also recognized the beautiful prospects of the New China.

	The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles have given us all self-knowledge – knowledge of ourselves. When people still have some arrogant ideas, it is necessary to recognize the insignificance of the individual through mass struggle. Otherwise, they will not see the masses or the leadership; they will put themselves in an inappropriate position – out of place. However, if, after the struggle, self-arrogance turns into inferiority, then one is putting oneself in another inappropriate position in the opposite direction – another way of being out of place. The cooperation of the various components within the people's democratic united front is to achieve that each finds its proper place under organized and led conditions. The facts of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles may prove this point: Even if an arrogant person can exert some initiative, that initiative will not be correct, and may even have the opposite negative effect. A person who is inferior will have no initiative at all. A person must be neither arrogant nor inferior in order to exert correct initiative.

	Everyone recognizes the beauty of the New China's future. In less than three years since the founding of the country, there has been rapid progress in political, economic, and cultural construction domestically; internationally, the Chinese people have been loved and praised by the people of the world, and China has become a first-class power in the world. In a few more three-year periods, the glory and happiness of the Chinese people will surely exceed our imagination today. The Chairman's opening remarks pointed out: "We must broaden our horizons." I think everyone has improved themselves in the "Five-Anti" movement, and this can be done. As long as industrialists and businessmen eliminate the five poisons and never commit them again, they are still a part of the Chinese people's team, united and helping each other. We can go hand in hand with the people of the whole country and the people of the world towards a beautiful future. What reason do we have not to increase our initiative and contribute our share of strength!

	This meeting will solve a series of problems. The first step in solving all problems is to grasp the overall situation. This depends on the representatives actively reflecting the real situation. The second step is to pool the wisdom of the masses and determine the methods and steps to solve the problems, which depends even more on the representatives actively contributing their opinions. It must be believed that only under the leadership of the Communist Party is democracy real and full. It is extremely important to fully believe in the call of the Communist Party and to mobilize everyone to use their brains and actively hold a good meeting. This meeting will test whether everyone has established sufficient initiative after the "Five-Anti" movement. If everyone exerts their initiative, we will definitely be able to hold a good meeting, and we will definitely be able to improve the operational initiative of the national industrial and commercial circles. The national working class has already set off a wave of increasing production and practicing economy, and the material exchange conferences in various urban and rural areas have achieved great results. This fact proves that a bright and proper development prospect is waiting for our industrialists and businessmen. In order to live up to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we must guarantee that we strive for the great victory of the meeting with the greatest initiative.

    民主建国会召集人章乃器在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上致词（摘要）主席团、各位代表、各位同志：
    这次会议是中国工商界历史上空前的盛会。经过了伟大的“五反”运动，又参加了这一次盛大的会议，我想我们工商界的代表们一定会共同感到是很荣幸的，是有重大意义的。
    “三反”、“五反”斗争的胜利是很伟大的。从整个新国家来说，它基本上消除了三害和五毒，扫清了进行大规模国家建设的障碍，巩固了工人阶级和国营经济的领导，保证了新民主主义的行程不走弯路。从工商业者来说，在“五反”斗争中通过了群众的批评教育，经过了自我思想斗争，认识了自己的消极面和积极面，认识了自己的光明前途，认识了群众力量的伟大，认识了工人阶级、中国共产党和人民政府的宽大与严肃相结合的大公无私、与人为善的伟大精神，也认清了新中国美丽的远景。
    “三反”、“五反”斗争使我们大家有了自知之明——认识了自己。当人们还有一些自高自大思想的时候，经过群众斗争，认识个人的渺小是必要的。否则便要看不见群众，也看不见领导；便会把自己放在一个不适当的地位——不得其所。但，倘使经过了斗争，由自高自大变成了自卑，那又是在相反的方向把自己放在另一个不适当的地位——另一种方式的不得其所。人民民主统一战线之内各个组成部分的配合，是要在有组织、有领导的条件之下达到各得其所。“三反”、“五反”斗争的事实，可能证明这一点：自高自大的人即使能够发挥一些积极性，那种积极性是不会正确的，甚至是会起了相反的消极作用的。自卑的人就根本不会有积极性。一个人必须是既不自高自大，又不自卑，才能发挥正确的积极性。
    新中国前途的美丽，大家都是认识的。建国还不到三年，在国内，是政治、经济、文化建设的突飞猛进；在国际上，中国人民已经得到全世界人民的热爱和歌颂，中国已经成为世界上第一等强国。再过几个三年，中国人民的光荣和幸福一定会超过我们今天的想像。主席的开会词指出：“我们必须把眼光放远放大”。我想，大家都已经在“五反”运动中提高了自己，这一点是可以做得到的。工商业者只要消除了五毒，决不再犯，就仍然是中国人民队伍当中团结互助的一分子。我们能够和全国人民一道，和全世界人民一道，走向美丽的前途，我们还有什么理由不提高积极性，贡献自己的一分力量呢！
    这次会议要解决一系列的问题。一切问题的解决，第一步必须掌握全面的情况。这就有待于各位代表积极反映真实情况。第二步还要集思广益，确定解决问题的方法和步骤，这更有赖于各位代表积极贡献意见。必须相信，只有在共产党领导之下，民主才是真实的，充分的。完全相信共产党的号召，大家一致开动脑筋，积极开好会议，是极端重要的。这次会议将测验大家在“五反”运动之后是否建立起来足够的积极性。大家都发挥了积极性，就一定可以开好会议，也一定可以提高全国工商界的经营积极性。全国工人阶级已在掀起增产节约运动的热潮，各地城乡物资交流大会都获得巨大的成绩。这种事实证明，一个光明的正当发展前途，正在等待着我们工商业者。为要不辜负中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，我们必须保证以最大的积极性争取会议的伟大胜利。
