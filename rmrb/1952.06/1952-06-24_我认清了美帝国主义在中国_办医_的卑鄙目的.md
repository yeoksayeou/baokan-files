    I Recognize the Despicable Purpose of American Imperialism in "Running Hospitals" in China
    Editor: The article "Startling Evidence of Crimes" once again exposes the ugly true face of American imperialism. Under the guise of "running hospitals" and "running schools," American imperialism harbored the most vicious conspiracies against China and committed countless bloody deeds! I remember more than ten years ago, my grandfather once told me: "You must not go to Peking Union Medical College Hospital! It is a place that harms people. Your uncle died there from a tooth extraction, and your grandfather went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for stomach pain, and he died on the way back.” However, at that time, I mistakenly thought that he did not believe in science.
    Today, after seeing this true depiction, I understand the nature of American imperialism's "charity." American imperialism, in the name of "charity," has numbed and deceived countless people with weak wills! I myself was once deceived. Now, I understand the reasons for the deaths of my uncle and grandfather.　　　　　Cai Boying

### 我认清了美帝国主义在中国“办医”的卑鄙目的

    我认清了美帝国主义在中国“办医”的卑鄙目的
    编辑同志：“怵目惊心的罪证”一文又一次揭露了美帝国主义丑恶的原形。美帝国主义在“办医”、“办学”的遮羞布的掩盖下，对中国怀着何等恶毒的阴谋，干了多少血腥的勾当！记得十多年前，我的祖父就曾经对我说过：“协和医院去不得呀！那是害人的地方，你的叔父是在那里拔牙死的，你的外祖父肚子痛去协和医院看病，在回来的途中就不行了。”但是，那时我还错误地以为他老人家不相信科学。
    今天我看了这一幅真实的写照，我明白了美帝国主义的“慈善事业”的本质。美帝国主义假“慈善”之名不知麻痹、欺骗了多少意志薄弱的人！我自己就是曾经被蒙蔽的一个。现在，我明白了我叔父和外祖父死亡的原因了。　　　　　蔡伯英
