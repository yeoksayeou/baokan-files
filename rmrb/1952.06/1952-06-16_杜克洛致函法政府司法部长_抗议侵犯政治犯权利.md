    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 14th: Duclos, the secretary of the French Communist Party, currently in prison, has written to the Minister of Justice, Mr. Debre, of the Pinay government, protesting the government's violation of legal regulations regarding the rights of political prisoners. He protested the discriminatory measures taken against him and all patriots who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned on the false charge of "endangering domestic security," and the restrictions on their visits. In his letter, Duclos pointed out that the Pinay government's treatment of political prisoners was "even less lenient than during the time of Napoleon III." Duclos vehemently denounced the authorities' illegal framing, saying that the French judicial authorities were arresting people on the basis of fabricated "conspiracies" without being able to produce any evidence, and were taking discriminatory measures against those arrested, which was illegal.
    Since his illegal arrest on May 28th, Duclos has been subjected to various illegal abuses by the judicial authorities. On the night of his arrest, he was taken to the 10th District Police Station in Paris. The next day, after a cursory interrogation, the judicial authorities sent Duclos to the Fresnes prison, ten miles south of Paris, and imprisoned him with ordinary criminals, completely disregarding the respect and rights that political prisoners are entitled to by law. It was not until May 31st that the French government, under Duclos's stern protests and the people's indignation, transferred Duclos to the Santé prison and granted him the treatment due to a political prisoner. However, the judicial authorities have not abandoned their various illegal persecutions of Duclos. They have not only infringed upon his rights as a political prisoner, but also disregarded the doctor's advice, causing Duclos's existing diabetes to worsen. This unbridled behavior of the French government in harming the leader of the French people has aroused great anger among the French people and the people of the world.

    杜克洛致函法政府司法部长
    抗议侵犯政治犯权利
    【新华社十四日讯】巴黎消息：现在狱中的法国共产党书记杜克洛写信给比内政府的司法部长德勃拉，抗议政府违背法律对政治犯应享权利的规定，对他和一切被诬以“危害国内安全”罪而被非法逮捕和监禁的爱国者采取歧视措施，限制他们接见探望者。杜克洛在信里指出：比内政府对政治犯的待遇，“甚至还不如拿破仑第三时代宽大”。杜克洛痛斥当局的非法陷害说：法国司法当局以凭空臆造的所谓“阴谋”为罪名，逮捕人民，但是不能提出一点证据，并且对被捕者采取歧视待遇，这是非法的。
    杜克洛自从在五月二十八日被非法逮捕以后，就遭到司法当局的种种非法虐待。被捕的当晚，他被押到巴黎第十区警察局。第二天，司法当局草草讯问过杜克洛后，就把他送到了巴黎以南十英里的费雷纳监狱，和普通刑事犯关在一起，完全无视法律规定政治犯所应受到的尊重和应享的权利。一直到五月三十一日，法国政府迫于杜克洛严正的抗议和人民的义愤，才把杜克洛送到桑台监狱，予以政治犯待遇。但是，司法当局仍然没有放弃对杜克洛的种种非法迫害，他们不但侵犯了他的政治犯权利，而且不顾医生的劝告，使得杜克洛原来所患的糖尿病病势加重。法国政府肆无忌惮危害法国人民领袖的这种行径，已经引起法国人民和全世界人民极大的愤怒。
