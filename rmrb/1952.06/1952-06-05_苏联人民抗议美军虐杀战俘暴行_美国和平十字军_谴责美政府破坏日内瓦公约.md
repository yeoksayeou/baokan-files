Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Workers, engineers, and scientists throughout the Soviet Union continue to protest the atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea.

    At a rally at the Lenin Forging Plant in Kiev, engineer Ostafyev said: It is the sacred duty of every honest person to strongly demand an end to the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in mistreating and slaughtering prisoners of war, and to demand the most severe punishment for those war criminals who have violated human morality and the principles of international law. Kaliuzhny, a lathe worker at the plant, said: Now, the American executioners are once again causing rivers of blood to flow, as they gun down defenseless people in prisoner-of-war camps. But the executioners on Koje Island will not escape the judgment of the people's tribunal!
    At a mass rally held at the largest enterprise in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the Leather and Shoe Factory, young worker Baciulite said: The barbaric atrocities of the American imperialists and their accomplices in Korea are truly endless. They have turned Koje Island into an execution ground, where they massacre Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in large numbers. Our consciences can no longer remain silent! We demand an end to American atrocities in Korea! An elderly worker at the plant, Bogdanov, delivered a moving speech, saying: The instigators and participants of the war of plunder on Korean soil cannot conceal their crimes! All honest people in the world are outraged by the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors and their accomplices! Other enterprises in Vilnius have also held mass rallies to protest American atrocities in Korea.
    In their resolutions, the Soviet people demanded an immediate end to the slaughter and torture of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and expressed brotherly solidarity with the heroic Korean people who are defending their country's freedom and independence.
    Professor Kursanov, a renowned Soviet scientist and Director of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told a TASS reporter: American aggressors are experimenting on prisoners with deadly bacteria, various poisonous gases, and toxins. Reactionary scientists are thus helping the executioners in American military uniforms to commit evil deeds. Scientists who help war criminals commit crimes against humanity have no right and cannot be called scientific workers.
    Professor Korovin, a leading Soviet legal authority and Director of the Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, issued a statement on the crimes committed by American aggressors in Korea, saying: The Americans in Korea systematically kill Korean civilians and barbarously destroy peaceful Korean cities, conduct heinous bacteriological warfare, mistreat, torture, and kill defenseless Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, use prisoners of war to conduct chemical, atomic, and bacteriological weapons experiments, and attempt to force prisoners of war to refuse repatriation through threats of abuse and death. American monopoly capitalists and their accomplices completely disregard the long-recognized principle of treating disarmed enemies with humanity. We must especially point out that the Hague Convention and the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war have been signed by the American government. The Hague Convention, the 1929 Geneva Convention, and the 1949 Geneva Convention all stipulate that prisoners of war should be treated humanely. All of the above conventions clearly stipulate the principle of complete and unconditional repatriation of prisoners of war at the end of the war. In short, the crimes of the American aggressors in Korea have flagrantly violated the laws and customs of war. These crimes are stipulated by the decree of the Nuremberg International Tribunal and were also affirmed by the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946. Therefore, all justice-loving people throughout the world unanimously demand an immediate end to American atrocities in Korea and demand that war criminals be severely punished.

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: TASS Leningrad, May 31st: The working people of Leningrad, together with the entire Soviet people and progressive humanity, express great anger at the bloody atrocities of the American military in slaughtering captured Korean and Chinese personnel. On May 30th, workers and staff of the Kirov plant held a rally to protest the crimes of the American interventionists who turned Koje Island into an island of death. Baikov, a foreman of a steel rolling workshop, said: All honest people in the world solemnly protest the crimes of the enemies of humanity—the American imperialists and their mercenaries. We demand an end to the American imperialists' shameless atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. All speakers at the meeting expressed deep anger at the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors on Koje Island. The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting condemned the crimes committed by American murderers in Korea and demanded an end to these crimes.

Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: TASS New York, May 31st: "American Peace Crusaders" wrote to Truman demanding the exchange of all prisoners of war and an immediate end to the Korean War.

    The letter was signed by Richardson and Uphaus, National Chairmen of the "American Peace Crusaders." The letter said: "The United States has violated the 1949 Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, placing our country in an embarrassing position before the people of the world. The Geneva Convention stipulates the repatriation of prisoners of war 'without delay' and prohibits any screening. "The Koje Island and Busan incidents have exposed that screening is carried out through coercion and violence. American General Colson admitted that 'there have been bloodshed incidents resulting in many prisoners of war being killed and injured by American troops.'"
    The letter continued: "The issue of prisoners of war has stalled the Korean armistice talks for several months. It is clear that the current attitude of American spokesmen on this issue is not based on the facts of the situation. "The consequences of our current attitude are already being felt. Canada has protested the use of Canadian troops on Koje Island. Prime Minister Nehru has expressed regret that the stalemate in the armistice talks and the threat to world peace over the issue of prisoner exchange."
    The letter continued: "The prisoners of war want to go home. Their families want them to go home. The soldiers who face the threat of death every day because the armistice talks are delayed want to end this meaningless killing. Their families want to see their loved ones come home alive and well, rather than come home crippled or lying in a coffin."
    The letter concluded: "The vast majority of the American people have expressed in many different ways over the past year that they want an end to the Korean War. Labor, religious, and educational leaders are increasingly advocating a negotiated solution to achieve peace in Korea and world peace. We ask our government to now adapt to this growing sentiment, abide by the Geneva Convention, the provision of complete repatriation of prisoners of war without delay, and immediately end the Korean War."

    苏联人民抗议美军虐杀战俘暴行
    “美国和平十字军”谴责美政府破坏日内瓦公约
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各地的工人、工程师、科学家继续抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行。
    在基辅列宁锻冶厂的一个大会上，工程师奥斯塔夫耶夫说：强硬地要求制止美国侵略者虐待和屠杀战俘的血腥暴行，要求最严厉地惩办那些蹂躏人类道义与国际公法原则的战争罪犯，是每一个正直的人的神圣责任。该厂的车床工人卡利乌日尼说：现在，美国刽子手又在使人类流血成河了，他们在枪杀战俘营中手无寸铁的人们。但是，巨济岛上的刽子手们是逃不脱人民法庭的审判的！
    在立陶宛首都维尔那最大的一个企业制革与制鞋工厂所举行的群众大会上，青年工人巴楚利泰说：美帝国主义者及其帮凶在朝鲜的野蛮暴行真是没有止境。他们已把巨济岛变为一个刑场，在那里大批屠杀朝中战俘。我们的良心不能再缄默了！我们要求制止美国在朝鲜的暴行！该厂年老的工人波格达诺夫发表了一篇动人的演说，他说：朝鲜国土上掠夺战争的发动者和参加者隐瞒不了他们的罪行！世界上一切正直的人民都因为美国侵略者及其同谋犯的血腥暴行而愤怒了！维尔那的其他企业也曾举行群众大会，抗议美国在朝鲜的暴行。
    苏联人民在他们的决议中要求立刻制止屠杀和拷打朝中战俘，并对正在保卫他们国家自由与独立的英勇的朝鲜人民表示兄弟般的声援。
    著名苏联科学家、苏联科学院生物化学研究所所长库尔萨诺夫教授对塔斯社记者说：美国侵略者正在俘虏们身上试验着致命细菌、各种毒气和毒物的反应。反动科学家就这样帮助穿着美军制服的刽子手们为非作恶。帮助战犯对人类干出罪行的科学家没有权利、也不能被称为科学工作者。
    苏联著名法学界权威、苏联科学院法律研究所所长柯罗文教授就美国侵略者在朝鲜犯下的罪行发表谈话说：美国人在朝鲜有计划地杀害朝鲜平民与野蛮地毁灭朝鲜的和平城市，进行罪恶滔天的细菌战，虐待、拷打、杀害赤手空拳的朝中战俘，以战俘来进行化学武器、原子武器与细菌武器试验，并企图以虐待与死亡的威胁来迫使战俘们拒绝遣返。美国独占资本家与他们的帮凶们根本不理会以人道对待解除了武装的敌人是全人类长久以来公认的法律。我们要特别指出：关于对待战俘问题的海牙公约与日内瓦公约都有美国政府的签字。海牙公约、
    一九二九年的日内瓦公约、一九四九年的日内瓦公约都规定战俘应该受到人道的待遇。所有上述公约都明白规定在战争终了后全部无条件遣返战俘的原则。总之，美国侵略者在朝鲜的罪行已横暴地破坏了战争的法规与习惯。这些罪行都是纽伦堡国际法庭的法令所规定的，并且也是一九四六年联合国大会决议所确定的。因此，全世界一切有正义感的人民一致要求立即制止美国在朝鲜的暴行，并要求严惩战犯。 【新华社一日讯】塔斯社列宁格勒五月三十一日讯：列宁格勒的劳动人民，与全体苏联人民和进步人类一起，对于美军屠杀朝中被俘人员的血腥暴行，表示极大的愤怒。五月三十日，基洛夫工厂的工人和职员举行了一个大会，抗议把巨济岛变成死亡岛的美国干涉者的罪行。一个辗钢车间的工长白科夫说：世界上一切正直的人都严正地抗议人类公敌——美帝国主义者及其雇佣兵的罪行。我们要求中止美帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国战俘的无耻暴行。会上一切发言者都对美国侵略者在巨济岛上所犯的滔天罪行表示深切的愤怒。大会一致通过的决议，谴责美国杀人犯在朝鲜所犯的罪行，并要求中止这些罪行。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约五月三十一日讯：“美国和平十字军”写信给杜鲁门，要求交换全部战俘和立刻停止朝鲜战争。
    这封信是由“美国和平十字军”全国主席李查逊和厄普豪斯署名的。信上说：“美国破坏了一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约，使得我国在全世界人民面前处在一个难堪的地位。日内瓦公约规定‘毫不延迟地’遣返战俘，并且禁止任何甄别。 “巨济岛和釜山事件暴露了甄别是用威迫和暴力的方法来进行的。美国将军柯尔生承认‘有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被美国军队打死和击伤’。”
    信上又说：“战俘问题使得朝鲜停战谈判僵持了好几个月。事实很清楚，美国发言人目前在这个问题上的态度不是根据情势的事实出发的。 “我国目前态度的后果，现在已经感受到了。加拿大已抗议在巨济岛上使用加拿大军队。尼赫鲁总理表示，停战谈判僵持不决，在交换战俘的问题上竟使世界和平遭到威胁，这使他感到遗憾。”
    这封信又说：“战俘们希望回家。他们的家人希望他们回家。因停战谈判拖延下去而天天面临死亡威胁的兵士们，希望结束这个没有意义的杀戮。他们的家人希望看到他们的亲人健全地活着回家，而不是残废地回来或者是躺在棺材里回来。”
    这封信最后说：“绝大多数美国人民在过去一年中曾用许多不同的方法表示他们希望结束朝鲜战争。劳工、宗教及教育界的领袖们愈来愈主张用谈判办法来获致朝鲜和平与世界和平。我们要求我国政府现在适应这种日益强烈的情绪，遵守日内瓦公约，毫不延迟地全部遣返战俘的条款，立刻结束朝鲜战争。”
