    Friends of Peace, Friends of Life
    By Jùzàn Fǎshī
    Fifteen hundred years ago, the Armenian historian Moses, in his historical work, said: China opened up early, its culture is prosperous, its people are affluent, and their temperament is gentle. They can not only be "friends of peace" but also "friends of life." Mr. Moses's record shows that the Chinese people have always loved peace and opposed aggression. At the time of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, savoring this record, I felt it had an especially profound meaning.
    The exact time when China's exchanges with its neighbors began still needs to be researched. However, China was already mentioned in the historical book "Arthashastra" of the Indian Chandragupta Dynasty between 320 BC and 315 BC. It can be seen that China and India have been interacting for at least two thousand three or four hundred years. In these two thousand three or four hundred years of long-standing exchanges, China and India have always assisted each other with their respective national wisdom and labor achievements to promote the development of the cultures of the two major nations.
    As a Buddhist, I might as well briefly illustrate this further using the example of Buddhism's introduction from India to China. Buddhism was introduced to China from India around 60 AD. At that time, China's own culture had already spanned at least three thousand years. However, the Chinese people at that time absorbed Indian Buddhist culture with a zeal for seeking truth, without any prejudice whatsoever. Therefore, Buddhism has been able to spread in China to this day. After 700 AD, although the introduction of Indian thought gradually decreased, China's commerce with the Arabian and Persian regions greatly prospered. At that time, the footprints of Arabian and Persian merchants were almost everywhere in China. In Guangzhou alone, as many as 100,000 Arabian and Persian merchants gathered at the end of the Tang Dynasty. This kind of cultural exchange and peaceful trade promoted the development of our country's culture. At the same time, Chinese culture also spread all over the world. In the fourth century BC, Chinese silk and tea were transported to India. In Sanskrit vocabulary, some metals and fruits, such as iron, steel, lead, peaches, and pears, indicate that they came from China. Silkworm seeds were introduced to Persia around 550 AD, and papermaking was introduced to Arabia around 713 AD. These are all important matters in world cultural history and are of great significance to the development of world civilization.
    Looking back at the past of history and exploring the connotation of culture, we feel extraordinarily close to the culture and art of India and other Asian countries. The people of India and other countries must also feel the same closeness to Chinese culture and art. In modern times, transportation has developed, shortening the distance on the earth, and we are also feeling closer to the people of all nationalities across the Pacific Ocean and even all over the world day by day. There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Treat people as my own siblings, and treat things as my companions." This sentence shows our people's desire to treat all nations in the world equally and live in peace.
    We Buddhists advocate "equality of all beings," which is precisely this wish. However, in modern times, there has been imperialism, which has enslaved the people all over the world and has twice brewed world wars, in which countless lives have been killed. Now, the suffering of World War II has not yet subsided, and the imperialists have once again developed murderous intentions, and peace in Asia, the Pacific, and even the whole world is facing serious threats. Today, peace-loving people from all countries in Asia and the Pacific Rim gather together to seek unity and cooperation and to defend the great cause of peace. I believe that Buddhists from all countries will work together to respond to the call of this conference and strive for world peace, so that all nations in the world can become friends of peace and friends of life.

### 和平之友，生命之友

    和平之友，生命之友
    巨赞法师
    一千五百年前，亚美尼亚的历史学家摩西先生在他所著的历史书中说：中国开化早，文化盛，人民富裕，性情温和，不但可以做“和平之友”，同时也是“生命之友”。摩西先生的记载，说明我们中国人民历来就是爱好和平，反对侵略的。在这亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议在北京召开的时候，玩味着这个记载，格外觉得意味深长。
    中国和其四邻的交往，究竟开始于什么时候，还待研究。但在公元前三百二十年至三百十五年间，印度栴陀罗笈多王朝的历史书“考铁利亚”当中已经提到中国。可见中国和印度的交往，至少在二千三四百年以前。在这二千三四百年悠久的交往之中，中国和印度一直是以彼此的民族智慧和劳动成果互相协助，来促进两大民族文化的发展。
    我是一个佛教徒，不妨再拿佛教自印度传入中国以后的例子略加说明。佛教自印度传入中国，大约在公元六十年前后，那时中国自己的文化，至少已经绵历了三千年。但那时的中国人以一种追求真理的热忱来吸收印度佛教文化，绝无丝毫偏见存在。因此佛教能够在中国流传到现在。公元七百年以后，印度思想的传入虽然逐渐减少，但中国对于阿拉伯和波斯一带的通商，却大大繁盛起来。那时中国各地几乎都有阿拉伯和波斯商人的足迹。只广州一埠，在唐朝末年还麇集阿拉伯和波斯商人十万之众。这种文化交往与和平通商，曾促进了我国文化的发展。与此同时，中国文化也传遍了全世界。在公元前第四世纪的时候，中国的丝和茶运到了印度。在梵文的辞汇中，有些金属和果品，如像钢铁、铅、桃子、梨子之类，都是表明从中国去的。蚕种的输入波斯约在公元五五○年，造纸法的输入阿拉伯约在公元七一三年左右。这许多都是世界文化史上的重要事项，对于世界文明的发展是有很大的关系的。
    回溯历史的既往，探究文化的内涵，我们对于印度以及其他亚洲国家的文化和艺术感到异常的亲切，印度以及其他各国的人民对于中国的文化和艺术，一定也感到同样的亲切。近代交通发达，缩短了地球上的距离，我们和太平洋对岸各民族以至全世界各地的人民，也彼此一天一天感到亲切起来了。中国有一句古语，叫做“民吾同胞，物吾与也”，这句话显示了我国人民与世界各民族平等相待、和平相处的愿望。
    我们佛教主张“众生平等”，也正是这种愿望。但近世有了帝国主义，他们奴役世界各地的人民，并且两次酿成世界大战，无数生灵被他们杀害。现在，第二次世界大战的苦难未平，而帝国主义者又起了杀机，亚洲、太平洋以至全世界的和平都感受严重威胁。今天，亚洲、太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平的人士聚会一堂、谋求团结合作、保卫和平的大业，我相信各国的佛教徒，都将同心协力，响应这次会议的号召，为争取世界和平而努力，使世界各民族都成为和平之友，生命之友。
