    The Propaganda Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Inspects Cadres' Current Affairs Learning

    Editor: Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China抽查 conducted a random check on the newspaper reading and learning of cadres in seven units within the city's financial and economic system. It was found that many cadres and individual leading comrades did not pay enough attention to newspaper reading and learning, and had very little understanding of current affairs issues. A small number of people read newspapers in order to improve their professional skills, and they only read materials related to their own work. Some people only pay attention to novel things happening in the city, and pay no attention to major domestic and international events. Most people only skim the headlines when reading newspapers, without reading the content; even if they do read the content, they only glance at it superficially. This group of people has a relatively limited understanding of current affairs issues. For example, Zhang Yu, the manager of the Tangshan Salt Company, only knew that Song Qingling and ten others in our country had initiated the convocation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, but did not know why the conference was being held. He knew nothing about why the Korean armistice negotiations have not made progress. Some people rarely read newspapers, or only look at the daily market quotations, movie, and theater advertisements. For example, Wang Yixin, the manager of the Coal Construction Company, subscribes to quite a few newspapers, but rarely reads them systematically. Yang Runtian, the deputy manager of the Native Produce Company, only looks at the daily "Native Produce Market."

    In summary, we can see that the situation of economic work cadres in Tangshan City neglecting current affairs learning is quite serious. The main reason why this situation has not been overcome and changed for a long time is that the leading organs do not pay enough attention to cadres' current affairs learning; secondly, some cadres have purely technical viewpoints and a tendency to neglect politics. They do not understand that newspapers are an important tool for the Party to implement policies, connect with the masses, and guide work. Therefore, they feel that "you can't get by without learning technology and business, but it doesn't matter much if you don't learn current affairs and politics." In order to reverse this situation, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department has begun to formulate specific measures to improve newspaper reading and learning, and strengthen the leadership of current affairs learning for cadres throughout the city.

    检查干部时事学习情况
    编辑同志：最近，中共唐山市委宣传部，在市财经系统中，抽查了七个单位的干部的读报学习，发现不少干部和个别领导同志不重视读报学习，对时事问题了解很少。有少数人是为了提高自己的业务水平而看报，他们只看一些与自己的业务工作有关的材料。有一部分人只看本市发生的新奇事情，至于国内外大事，则一点也不注意。多数人看报时只是浏览大标题，不看内容，即使看内容，也是走马观花，一扫而过。这部分人对于时事问题是了解得较少的。如唐山盐业公司经理张玉，他只知道我国宋庆龄等十一人发起召集亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，但不知道为什么召开这个会议。他对于目前朝鲜停战谈判为什么得不到进展，一无所知。还有些人很少看报，或者只看看当天的行情、电影、戏剧广告等。例如：煤建公司经理王一新，订的报纸倒不少，但是很少进行系统的阅读。土产公司副经理杨润田，每天只看看当天的“土产行情”。
    综上所述，我们可以看到唐山市经济工作干部忽视时事学习的情况是相当严重的。这种情况很长时间没有得到克服和改变，主要原因是领导机关对干部的时事学习重视不够；其次是有些干部存在着单纯技术观点和忽视政治的倾向，他们不懂得报纸是党贯彻政策、联系群众、指导工作的重要工具，因此觉得“不学技术不懂业务吃不开，不学时事不学政治没有多大关系”。为了扭转这种情况，市委宣传部已着手拟定改进读报学习的具体办法，加强全市干部时事学习的领导。
