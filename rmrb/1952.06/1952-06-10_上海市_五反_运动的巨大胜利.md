The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has, up to now, resolved the issues of over 90% of the city's 160,000 industrial and commercial households, except for a very small number of illegal merchants who have consistently engaged in illegal activities and refuse to confess. They are now rapidly shifting to production. The entire "Five-Anti" movement has won the expected great victory.

The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai was officially announced to have begun on March 25th. The development of the movement was divided into four phases: The first phase, in late March, was the key pilot stage. The Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee announced the guidelines, policies, and discipline of the "Five-Anti" movement, trained a large number of "Five-Anti" work cadres, organized a powerful "Five-Anti" inspection team, and selected 74 illegal industrial and commercial households from 36 industries for key pilot projects. In this phase, thanks to thorough preparations, careful arrangements, and the cooperation of workers, shop assistants, and senior staff, the initial battle was a complete victory. The prestige of the inspection team was greatly enhanced, and the arrogance of the lawless capitalists suffered a heavy blow. Most importantly, the "Five-Anti" staff gained rich combat experience through this key pilot project, creating conditions for the large-scale development of the movement in the future. April 1st to 12th was the second phase, and the movement was fully launched. The Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee mobilized workers, shop assistants, senior staff, and the families of capitalists to participate in the struggle on a large scale, and organized 1,000 inspection teams to stand by, forming an incomparably powerful force. The law-breaking capitalists who had confessed in the first phase were grateful for the lenient treatment by the People's Government and asked to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and they also participated in the struggle. At the same time, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee repeatedly explained the policies and ordered the law-breaking capitalists to confess automatically to avoid inspection. Faced with such clear policies, the law-breaking capitalists felt that the situation was irresistible and expressed their willingness to confess their problems automatically. This brought a new situation to the movement. With the development of the situation, the method of capitalists' "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation" began to replace the struggle method mainly based on inspection in the first phase, and the emphasis shifted from face-to-face struggle to back-to-back struggle. On the one hand, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committees in each district organized the key law-breaking capitalists who were willing to confess automatically into groups, and carried out self-reporting and mutual evaluation under the supervision of the inspectors to explain the problems. On the other hand, the staff fully mobilized the masses of workers and shop assistants in various factories and shops to report and provide materials, creating a powerful momentum to force the law-breaking capitalists to thoroughly confess in "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation." At the same time, based on the mobilization of workers and shop assistants, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee began to handle the problems of a number of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households. These industrial and commercial households actively participated in the struggle after receiving lenient treatment, and gradually formed a united front for the "Five-Anti" movement. After the end of the second phase of work, after a week of rest, the third phase began on April 20th. After the first two phases, the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai gained mature and complete experience, and the staff became more familiar with the art of struggle. Therefore, the movement formed a situation of pursuing the victory and scale became even greater after entering the third phase, becoming the climax of the entire movement. In this phase, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee generally used the method of combining fully mobilizing the masses and supervising the capitalists' "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation" to solve the problems of key law-breaking industrial and commercial households. Tens of thousands of people participated in "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation" meetings every day, and progress was rapid. An average of 1,000 industrial and commercial households automatically confessed their problems every day. The policy of combining leniency and strictness was adopted for small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, and they were handled quickly. After three phases of work, the problems of more than two-thirds of the city's industrial and commercial households were resolved, and the entire movement achieved a basic victory. This phase of work ended in early May, and then entered the fourth phase. In the fourth phase, in addition to continuing to solve the remaining problems of industrial and commercial households, the focus was on handling work and leading production, consolidating the achievements of the "Five-Anti" movement. Now, the entire movement has won the expected great victory.
    The above is an overview of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai.

The biggest feature of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai is that it has always implemented the principle of combining the "Five-Anti" with production. At the beginning of the movement, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee put forward the slogan of "No Mistakes in Both Five-Anti and Production". Even in the factories and shops inspected in the first phase, the staff mobilized workers and shop assistants to maintain normal production and operation. Because the "Five-Anti" movement improved the political consciousness of the workers, many factories increased their output. After the end of each phase of the movement, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee convened meetings of worker representatives and capitalists who had confessed to explain the significance and policies of the "Five-Anti" movement, calling on workers to unite with capitalists who had eliminated the "five poisons" to do a good job in production, and pointing out the future to the capitalists, calling on them to improve management. At the same time, the Municipal People's Government continued to expand the processing, ordering, procurement, and lending work of private enterprises, helping private enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to achieve normal development. In the later stage of the movement, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee emphasized the work of leading production even more. After the end of the third phase of the movement, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee convened a series of meetings of trade union cadres, worker representatives, senior staff representatives, capitalists and their agents, and family members, repeatedly explaining policies and clarifying some of the confused ideas of workers and capitalists. On this basis, labor-management consultation meetings centered on doing a good job in production were generally held in private factories and shops, and labor and management jointly worked out specific measures to overcome difficulties and improve management. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the workers was further improved, and many factories increased the output and quality of their products. Under the enthusiastic encouragement of the workers, the capitalists also strengthened their confidence in management, took the initiative to overcome the difficulties of funds and raw materials, and some even planned to expand equipment and expand production. Some factories and shops that had closed down before the "Five-Anti" movement have now gradually resumed production and business. Therefore, the "Five-Anti" movement has opened up broad prospects for the new healthy development of Shanghai's industry and commerce.

The outstanding success of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai lies in the firm and flexible mastery of the "Five-Anti" policy. From the perspective of the entire movement, the struggle of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai was serious, resolutely implementing the policy of repelling the frantic attack of the bourgeoisie and eliminating the "five poisons" of the bourgeoisie, but the specific steps were flexible. At the beginning of the movement, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, on the one hand, classified the industrial and commercial households in Shanghai according to the Beijing standards for classifying industrial and commercial households based on the materials of investigation and research, so as to grasp and handle them separately. On the other hand, because the arrogance of the law-breaking capitalists was still great, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, in addition to openly and repeatedly explaining the policies, focused on emphasizing the struggle. The Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee first organized a powerful "Five-Anti" inspection team to focus on inspecting 74 households, striking down the arrogance of the law-breaking capitalists. However, after these capitalists thoroughly confessed, surrendered and pleaded guilty, and eliminated the "five poisons", the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee gave them lenient treatment and absorbed them into the "Five-Anti" struggle, giving them the opportunity to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. In this way, not only did the law-breaking capitalists who had confessed were convinced by the government's policies, but it also helped the development of the movement in the future. After the first phase of serious struggle, the front of the law-breaking capitalists began to collapse, and the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee promptly put forward a new method of struggle, replacing inspection with "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation", and determined to concentrate its efforts to solve the problems of large and small households first, so as to quickly win the majority in terms of the proportion of productivity and the proportion of households, making the "Five-Anti" united front increasingly consolidated and expanded. The development of the movement was therefore smoother and faster. After the movement had achieved a basic victory, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee further emphasized uniting with the capitalists who had eliminated the "five poisons" in order to do a good job in production. This policy was especially reflected in the handling of work. The staff carried out the work of verification and finalization according to the instructions of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee. It was necessary to ensure that the amount of illegal funds of the law-breaking capitalists cleared out in the struggle was verified to be in line with the actual economic situation, and the confession materials and specific circumstances of each industrial and commercial household were analyzed and studied, and the policy of "strict struggle and lenient handling" was implemented in order to be conducive to production and unity. In this way, not only were the "five poisons" of the law-breaking capitalists eliminated, but also it was conducive to production and construction, truly achieving the goal of "Five-Anti is to develop production". The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai successfully mastered the principle of "both struggle and unity" towards the bourgeoisie instructed by Chairman Mao, so that the movement was always carried out normally and healthily.

Another feature of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai is the successful combination of fully mobilizing the masses and strict control. First of all, the principle of fully mobilizing the masses was emphasized. Before the movement officially started, the Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee mobilized workers and shop assistants to report, providing sufficient materials for the movement. Then, various training classes were opened to train a large number of workers, shop assistants, and senior staff, making them the backbone of the movement. After the movement was officially announced to have started, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee emphasized fully mobilizing the staff to participate in the struggle, and organized work groups composed of trained backbone members to go deep into factories and shops to establish "Five-Anti" committees and "Five-Anti" work teams, leading the masses of workers and shop assistants to launch a grievance campaign, enlightening their class consciousness, and then guiding the class hatred of the staff to the "Five-Anti" struggle, and launched a wider and deeper reporting movement, and carried out a back-to-back struggle with the capitalists. Through such a struggle, a large number of criminal facts of law-breaking capitalists harming the country and the people and frantically attacking the working class were exposed, and the staff further clarified the class boundaries politically. According to incomplete statistics, more than 80% of the city's workers and shop assistants participated in grievance and reporting. In Changning District alone, 596 large and small accusation meetings were held, with more than 26,000 people participating. Eighty percent of the staff of Yuanchang Steel Plant carried out reporting, reporting more than 400 cases of illegal facts by the capitalists. Many staff members who were originally relatives or fellow villagers of the capitalists broke their concerns, stood firm, and launched a struggle with the law-breaking capitalists. Fan Zongwen, the nephew-in-law, and Ni Menghou, the brother-in-law of the boss of Huaxin Instrument Stationery Factory, reported more than 30 illegal facts by the capitalists. Senior staff who had been used by the capitalists in the past also returned to the team and returned to the ranks of the working class, and the staff became more united. However, mobilizing the masses is closely combined with strict control. Before the movement officially started, because the preparations were not yet mature, at an appropriate time in the initial reporting movement, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee made appropriate adjustments to the work of mobilizing the masses in order to concentrate its efforts on organizing and training the team and carrying out class education, policy education, and discipline education, so as to make organizational and ideological preparations for the formal launch of the movement. At the beginning of the movement, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee announced eight disciplines to ensure that the movement was carried out in an orderly manner. With the development of the struggle situation, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee paid more attention to educating the masses at every important link and changing the way of struggle. For example, in the early stage of the movement, the emphasis was on tearing up feelings and fighting bravely. When the activists had risen, the law-breaking capitalists had repented, and the middle and backward elements among the staff still had concerns, the emphasis was placed on back-to-back struggle in order to mobilize the masses more universally and deeply. After the staff had been tempered by the back-to-back struggle and grasped the policies, they returned to face-to-face education and reasoning. In this way, the staff was fully mobilized, and the struggle was reasonable, beneficial, and restrained. After the law-breaking capitalists had eliminated the "five poisons", the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee emphasized uniting with the capitalists to do a good job in production, and called on the staff to consider the long-term interests and take the initiative to unite with the capitalists. Therefore, the entire movement was carried out in a very disciplined and orderly manner.

After the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai, not only was the normal economic state maintained, but also a number of new atmospheres appeared. First of all, the "five poisons" of the law-breaking capitalists were eliminated, and the face of society was changed. Before the "Five-Anti" movement, Shanghai's market transactions were extremely speculative and fraudulent, fake medicines and fake goods were everywhere, and speculation and profiteering were even more common. But after the "Five-Anti" movement, these phenomena disappeared. Jimai Pharmacy, which used to sell fake medicines, cleaned up and destroyed the bad medicines after the "Five-Anti" movement. Tianfeng Pharmaceutical Factory has stopped selling the new stibicon needles with excessive toxicity and unsuitable for use, and has recovered those that have been sold. Because Shanghai is the center of national industry and commerce, and most of Shanghai's products are transported and sold to all parts of the country, the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai is directly beneficial to the national economic construction. Secondly, a new public-private relationship has emerged. In the past, law-breaking capitalists not only did not obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, but also embezzled state property by stealing materials and reducing workmanship in transactions with state-owned enterprises. This bad habit of stealing materials and reducing workmanship has now begun to be eliminated. Private factories have improved the quality of their products in undertaking state orders, and delivered them on time in accordance with the contract. For example, the processing orders for the first phase of the Huai River project have been completely up to standard and completed on schedule. This is not only beneficial to the operation of the capitalists, but also more beneficial to national construction. Thanks to the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, the interests of both public and private sectors were truly taken into account, and the leading position of the state-owned economy was established. At the same time, there have been significant changes in labor-management relations. The workers have established the idea of being the masters of the country, and the capitalists have also recognized the leading role of the working class. Therefore, labor-management relations have been improved, and everyone is further united under the premise of doing a good job in production, and striving for the construction of the motherland and opposing the aggression of American imperialism. The staff of private factories and shops have played their labor enthusiasm, improved output and quality, and the capitalists have also improved their confidence in management.

The success of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai, in addition to correctly implementing the "Five-Anti" policy, also lies in: (1) The victory and prestige of the national "Five-Anti" struggle. Only under the victorious situation of the whole country can Shanghai's victory be so rapid and great. (2) Absorbing the struggle experience of various places, and summarizing its own experience in a timely manner according to the characteristics of Shanghai, so as to guide the movement. For example, after the end of the first phase of the struggle, the leading organs timely summarized ten experiences and quickly launched the second phase of work. After the second phase of struggle, the experience of the first phase was further enriched, creating mature and complete experience for the entire movement. (3) Centralized unity and close cooperation are also important reasons for success. For example, in order to mobilize the masses in a planned way, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee unified the workers, youth, and women's mass organizations. While mobilizing the staff to participate in the struggle, it also attached importance to the work of the families and children of the capitalists. This created a situation of internal and external attacks on the law-breaking capitalists, making the law-breaking capitalists completely isolated and had to confess their problems. For example, while struggling against the "five poisons" of the law-breaking capitalists, state-owned enterprises continued to expand the processing, ordering, and投放 (toufang - literally "putting in", referring to investment), and procurement of private enterprises, maintaining normal production and operation.

Now, the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai is close to the final and complete victory. It can be expected that on the basis of the new atmosphere that has already appeared, after the final victory of the movement, Shanghai's production and economic prosperity will surely achieve greater development and play a huge role in the national economic construction.

    上海市“五反”运动的巨大胜利
    新华社记者
    上海市的“五反”运动，到目前为止，除极少数一贯进行非法活动而又拒不坦白的不法商人的问题须要继续解决外，全市十六万工商户中已有百分之九十以上交清问题，迅速转入生产。整个“五反”运动，已赢得预期的伟大胜利。
    上海市的“五反”运动是在三月二十五日宣布正式开始的。运动的发展分为四期：第一期在三月下旬，是重点试验阶段。市增产节约委员会宣布了“五反”运动的方针政策和纪律，训练了大批“五反”工作干部，组织了强大的“五反检查队”，选择了包括三十六个行业的七十四户违法工商户进行重点试验。在这期中，由于事先准备充分，布置周密，以及工人、店员和高级职员的配合，初战即获全胜。检查队的声威大振，不法资本家的气焰遭到了沉重的打击。尤其重要的是：“五反”工作人员通过这一重点试验取得了丰富的斗争经验，为以后大规模开展运动创造了条件。四月一日到十二日为第二期，运动即全面展开。市增产节约委员会一面大规模地发动工人、店员、高级职员和资本家家属参加斗争，一面又组织了一千个检查队待命出发，形成了强大无比的威力。第一期已经坦白的违法资本家感激人民政府对他们的宽大处理，要求立功赎罪，也纷纷参加了斗争。同时，市增产节约委员会再次反复交代政策，责令违法资本家们自动坦白，争取免予检查。在这样鲜明的政策面前，不法资本家们都感到势不可当，表示愿意自动交代问题。这样就给运动带来了新的形势。随着形势的发展，开始以资本家“互助互评”的方式代替了第一期以检查为主的斗争方式，从强调面对面的斗争转到背靠背的斗争。一方面，各区增产节约委员会把愿意自动坦白的重点违法资本家编成小组，在检查队员的监督之下进行自报互评，交代问题。另一方面又在各个工厂商店充分发动职工群众进行检举，提供材料，造成强大的声势，迫使不法资本家在“互助互评”中不能不彻底交代。同时，在发动工人、店员的基础之上，增产节约委员会开始处理了一批中小工商户的问题。这些工商户在受到宽大处理后又积极参加斗争，因而逐渐形成了“五反”统一战线。第二期工作结束后，经过一个星期的休整，在四月二十日进入第三期。经过一、二两期，上海市“五反”运动取得了成熟而完备的经验，工作人员对斗争艺术已更为熟习。因此运动在进入第三期后即形成了乘胜追击的局面，规模更加浩大，成为整个运动的高潮。在这期中，市增产节约委员会普遍运用了充分发动群众与监督资本家“互助互评”相结合的方式来解决重点违法工商户的问题，每天都有数以万计的人参加“互助互评”会议，进展很快，平均每天有一千户工商户自动交代问题。对于中小工商户更采取了宽大与严肃相结合的方针，作了迅速的处理。经过三期的工作，解决了全市三分之二以上的工商户的问题，使整个运动获得了基本的胜利。这一期工作在五月初结束后，随即转入第四期。在第四期中，除了继续解决剩余的工商户的问题外，着重进行了处理工作和领导生产的工作，巩固“五反”运动的成果。现在，整个运动已赢得了预期的巨大胜利。
    以上就是上海“五反”运动的概貌。
    上海市“五反”运动的最大特点，是始终贯彻了“五反”结合生产的方针。运动一开始，市增产节约委员会即提出了“五反生产两不误”的口号。就是在第一期检查的工厂商店中，工作人员也发动工人、店员维持了正常的生产经营。由于“五反”运动提高了职工的政治觉悟，许多工厂都提高了产量。在运动的每一期结束后，市增产节约委员会都召开了职工代表会议和已坦白的资本家会议，说明“五反”运动的意义和政策，号召职工团结已经清除“五毒”的资本家搞好生产，并给资本家指明前途，号召他们改善经营。同时，市人民政府继续扩大了对私营企业的加工定货和收购贷放工作，帮助有利国计民生的私营企业获得正常发展。到了运动的后期，市增产节约委员会更加强调领导生产的工作。在运动的第三期结束后，增产节约委员会分别召开了一系列的工会干部会、工人代表会、高级职员代表会、资本家及其代理人会和家属会议，反复说明政策，澄清了职工和资本家的某些混乱思想。在这一基础上，各私营工厂商店普遍召开了以搞好生产为中心的劳资协商会议，劳资双方具体订出了克服困难、改善经营的办法。因此，职工更加提高了生产积极性，许多工厂都提高了产品的产量和质量。在职工的热情鼓舞之下，资本家也加强了经营信心，主动克服资金和原料的困难，有的还计划扩充设备，扩大生产。一部分在“五反”以前即已歇业的工厂商店，现在也已逐渐恢复生产和营业。因此，“五反”运动已为上海工商业新的健康发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    上海市“五反”运动的突出成功处，是坚定而又灵活地掌握了“五反”政策。从整个运动来说，上海市“五反”运动的斗争是严肃的，坚决贯彻了打退资产阶级猖狂进攻、肃清资产阶级“五毒”的方针，但在具体步骤上又是灵活的。在运动开始时，增产节约委员会一方面根据调查研究的材料，按照北京市关于工商户分类标准，把上海市工商户作了初步分类，以便掌握和分别处理；另一方面，由于不法资本家的气焰还大，增产节约委员会除了公开地反复地讲清政策之外，着重强调了斗争的一面。市增产节约委员会首先组织了强大的“五反”检查队，重点检查了七十四户，打下不法资本家的气焰。但当这些资本家彻底坦白、俯首认罪、清除“五毒”之后，增产节约委员会又给予他们以宽大处理，并吸收他们参加“五反”斗争，给予立功赎罪的机会。这样，不仅使已经坦白的不法资本家对政府的政策口服心服，而且有助于以后运动的开展。经过第一期的严肃斗争，不法资本家的阵线开始崩溃，增产节约委员会便及时提出了新的斗争方式，以“互助互评”代替了检查，并确定集中力量先解决大户和小户的问题，以求得在生产力的比例上和户数的比例上，都迅速争取多数，使“五反”统一战线日益巩固和扩大。运动的发展因此更加顺利和迅速。当运动已取得基本胜利之后，增产节约委员会更进一步强调团结已经清除“五毒”的资本家，以便搞好生产，在处理工作上，尤其表现了这一方针。工作人员按照增产节约委员会的指示，进行核实定案工作。务使在斗争中清出来的不法资本家的违法款额核到合乎实际经济情况，根据每一工商户的坦白具结材料和他们的具体情况作了分析和研究，贯彻执行了“斗争从严、处理从宽”的方针，以便有利于生产和团结。这样既消除了不法资本家的“五毒”，又有利于生产建设，真正达到了“五反是为了发展生产”的目的。上海市“五反”运动就是这样成功地掌握了毛主席指示的“又斗争又团结”的对待资产阶级的原则，使运动始终正常健康地进行着。
    上海市“五反”运动的另一特点，是充分发动群众与严密控制相结合的成功。首先是强调充分发动群众的方针。在运动尚未正式开始之前，市增产节约委员会即发动工人、店员进行检举，为运动提供了充分的材料。接着开办了各种训练班，训练了大批的工人、店员和高级职员，使他们成为运动的骨干。当运动宣布正式开始以后，增产节约委员会更强调充分发动职工参加斗争，以经过训练的骨干分子组成工作组，深入工厂商店建立“五反”委员会和“五反”工作队，领导工人店员群众展开诉苦运动，启发他们的阶级觉悟，然后再把职工的阶级仇恨引导到“五反”斗争，展开了更广泛更深入的检举运动，和资本家进行了背靠背的斗争。经过这样的斗争，大量揭发了不法资本家违害国家人民、向工人阶级猖狂进攻的罪恶事实，职工们从而进一步从政治上划清了阶级界线。根据不完全的统计，全市有百分之八十以上的工人店员参加诉苦、检举，仅长宁区一个区即举行过五百九十六次大小控诉会，参加人数达二万六千多人。元昌钢厂的职工百分之八十都进行了检举，共检举资方违法事实四百多件。许多职工原是资本家的亲戚或同乡，都打破顾虑，站稳立场，和不法资本家展开了斗争。华新仪器文具厂老板的甥女婿范宗文、舅子倪孟侯，即检举了资方违法事实三十多件。过去被资本家所利用的高级职员也纷纷归队，回到了工人阶级的队伍，职工之间也更加团结了。但是，发动群众是与严密控制密切结合的。当运动正式开始之前，由于准备尚未成熟，在初期的检举运动达到适当的时机，增产节约委员会便对发动群众工作作了适当收缩，以便集中力量组织和训练队伍，进行阶级教育、政策教育和纪律教育，为正式开展运动作好组织准备和思想准备。在运动开始时，增产节约委员会又宣布了八项纪律，使运动进行得秩序井然。随着斗争形势的发展，增产节约委员会更抓紧每一个重要环节向群众进行教育，改变斗争方式。如在运动初期，是强调撕破情面，勇敢斗争。当积极分子已经起来，不法资本家已经悔罪，而职工中的中间分子和落后分子还有顾虑的时候，又强调了背靠背的斗争，以便更普遍更深入地发动群众。等职工群众经过背靠背斗争的锻炼，并掌握了政策之后，再回到面对面的教育和说理。这样既充分发动了职工群众，又使斗争有理有利有节。到不法资本家已经消除“五毒”之后，增产节约委员会便强调团结资本家搞好生产，并号召职工从长远利益打算，主动团结资本家。因此，整个运动进行得极有纪律和秩序。
    上海市经过“五反”运动之后，不仅保持了正常的经济状态，而且出现了若干新的气象。首先，是清除了不法资本家的“五毒”，使社会的面貌为之改观。在“五反”以前，上海的市场交易带有极大的投机性和欺诈性，假药、假货到处充斥，投机倒把的事更为普遍。但经过“五反”运动后，这些现象没有了。过去卖假药的集美药房，在“五反”以后即把坏药清理出来销毁。天丰药厂已将毒性过大、不适于使用的新锑康针药停止出售，并将已经出售的收回。由于上海是全国工商业的中心，上海的出品绝大部分运销全国各地，所以上海“五反”运动的胜利，也就直接有利于全国的经济建设。其次，是出现了新的公私关系。在过去，不法资本家不仅不服从国营经济的领导，而且在和国营企业部门交易中，大量偷工减料，盗窃国家资财。这种偷工减料的恶习现在已开始清除。各私营工厂在承制国家定货中，都提高了产品的质量，并按照合同规定如期交货。如第一期治淮工程的加工定货已做到了完全合规格，并按期完成。这样，既有利于资本家的经营，更有利于国家建设。由于“五反”运动的胜利，才真正做到了公私兼顾，确定了国营经济的领导地位。同时，在劳资关系上也有显著的改变。工人树立了国家主人翁的思想，资本家也认识了工人阶级的领导作用。因此，劳资关系得到了改善，大家都在搞好生产的前提下，进一步团结起来，为祖国的建设和反对美帝国主义侵略而奋斗。各私营工厂商店的职工发挥了劳动热情，提高了产量和质量，资本家也提高了经营信心。
    上海“五反”运动的成功，除了正确地贯彻了“五反”政策之外，还在于：（一）全国“五反”斗争的胜利声威的配合。只有在全国的胜利形势下，上海的胜利才会如此迅速和巨大。（二）吸收了各地的斗争经验，并根据上海的特点，及时地总结自己的经验，以指导运动。如在第一期斗争结束后，领导机关及时总结了十条经验，迅速开展了第二期工作。经过第二期斗争就更丰富了第一期的经验，为整个运动创造了成熟而完备的经验。（三）集中统一，密切配合，也是成功的重要原因。如增产节约委员会为了有步骤有计划地发动群众，统一了工人、青年、妇女群众团体；在发动职工参加斗争时，同时重视了资本家家属及子女工作，这就对不法资本家造成内外夹攻之势，使不法资本家完全陷于孤立，不得不交代问题。又如在斗争不法资本家“五毒”的同时，国营企业继续扩大对私营企业的加工、定货和投放、收购，维持了正常的生产和经营。
    现在，上海市的“五反”运动已接近最后的彻底胜利，可以预期：在现在已经出现的新的气象的基础之上，在运动最后胜利之后，上海的生产事业和经济繁荣，必然会获得更大的发展，发挥其在全国经济建设中的巨大作用。
