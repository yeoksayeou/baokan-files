    Planfully Promote Qu Yao Li's Cotton Abundance Experience
    In order to universally increase the per-unit area yield of cotton, the people's governments in various cotton-producing areas are gradually promoting the advanced experience of Qu Yao Li, a model of cotton abundance, in accordance with local conditions.
    Since the news of Qu Yao Li's cotton abundance was published last September, personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, and visiting groups organized by Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, and Shanxi provinces, including farm workers, technical cadres, and agricultural labor models, and cadres, labor models, and the masses from counties near Jie County, totaling more than 5,000 people, have visited Qu Yao Li's abundant cotton fields. Last November, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government announced the investigation report on Qu Yao Li's cotton abundance achievements and technical experience. Governments at all levels in most cotton-producing areas across the country organized experts, cadres, and labor models to study and discuss this report, and used it as teaching material in labor model conferences, agricultural technology training classes, mutual aid team leader representative meetings, and farmer's spare-time schools at all levels. From last winter to this spring, more than 5,000 people in Shanxi Province's labor model conferences and the masses near Jie County personally heard Qu Yao Li's abundant production technology report.
    This year, based on the cotton planting abundance experience of Qu Yao Li and others, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government issued instructions on improving cultivation techniques and increasing per-unit area yield; administrative regions and provinces such as Northeast, North China, Southwest, Shandong, and Shanxi, as well as some special areas and counties, have, according to Qu Yao Li's experience and the instructions of higher levels, combined with the experience of local abundance models, criticized the shortcomings in local cotton farming and cultivation, and formulated specific technical guidance outlines for increasing per-unit area yield of cotton. This has changed the view of many people who believed that "the government calls for a lot, but there is little concrete technical guidance, and problems cannot be solved," and at the same time, it has given many technical extension personnel a new weapon. Dezhou and Jiaozhou special districts in Shandong Province have also printed Qu Yao Li's abundance experience into special booklets and distributed them to district and village cadres and labor models as learning materials.
    There is no doubt that promoting Qu Yao Li's abundance experience in the vast cotton-producing areas is of extreme importance for increasing the per-unit area yield of cotton. His abundance experience has broken the conservative concepts and the idea that production has reached its limit of many people (including experts, professors, cadres, and farmers), and has increased the confidence of the vast cotton farmers in increasing per-unit area yield. In 1950, when Soviet experts introduced the situation of Soviet cotton fields producing 1,800 catties of seed cotton per mu, many people were very skeptical; but after learning Qu Yao Li's abundance experience, the number of people holding skeptical attitudes decreased day by day. At the abundance symposium in Yishui Special District, Shandong, some people were initially very skeptical about Qu Yao Li's yield. They asked: "What kind of mu is this that produces 900 catties of seed cotton per mu?" After careful study and research, they also believed it. Yang Zhaoxin, a cotton planting expert in Changqing County, has been planting cotton for more than 20 years, and the yield per mu has always been 100 to 200 catties of seed cotton. He thought that such a yield had "reached its limit." After learning Qu Yao Li's experience, he found the problems in his cotton cultivation and planned to increase the yield per mu to 320 catties of seed cotton. Many mutual aid teams across the country have proposed to catch up with Qu Yao Li's cotton yield.
    All localities have used Qu Yao Li's experience to criticize and correct the shortcomings in local cotton cultivation techniques. Most cotton-producing areas across the country are correcting the idea of sparse planting and steadily promoting the method of close planting; many areas have corrected the habit of under-watering and over-watering in cotton field irrigation, and promoted the experience of light and frequent watering. After learning Qu Yao Li's experience, many mutual aid teams in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, criticized the old farming methods of shallow winter plowing and deep spring plowing, over-watering and under-watering during irrigation, and neglecting pruning. After Qu Yao Li's experience was spread in the main cotton-producing areas of Shandong, the shortcomings of not daring to apply fertilizer to cotton fields (fearing excessive growth), topping cotton plants too early, planting cotton too sparsely, and not thoroughly controlling aphids were corrected. Zhong Maolin, a cotton planting expert in Sishui County, Shandong Province, planted 1.03 mu of cotton in 1951, with a total of 750 cotton plants, and thought that the density was very appropriate; after study and discussion, he voluntarily proposed that this year he must plant densely to 2,000 plants. Song Chengquan, a farmer in Handan County, Hebei Province, originally planned to produce 1,000 catties of abundant cotton per mu last year due to applying too much cake fertilizer (1,000 catties per mu), leaving too few seedlings (1,600 plants per mu), and not promptly controlling pests, but only received more than 400 catties; this year, he is determined to improve the mutual aid team, learn Qu Yao Li's method of timely sowing and thoroughly controlling aphids, and increase the cotton seedlings to 3,000 plants per mu, striving for a yield comparable to Qu Yao Li.
    This year, thanks to the vigorous organization of study and promotion of Qu Yao Li's abundance experience by party committees and governments at all levels, cotton planting technology in many areas has improved a step further. For example, governments at all levels and cotton farmers recognized that timely sowing and ensuring full seedlings are the primary key to ensuring abundance, and most of them have achieved timely cultivation and harrowing, preserving moisture and preventing drought; in addition, the rainfall this spring was timely, and most areas have achieved timely sowing, which is five days to half a month earlier than last year. Many areas have promoted the method of replanting and transplanting seedlings. The phenomenon of not applying fertilizer or not daring to apply fertilizer in cotton fields in the past has begun to be eliminated; many labor models plan to apply topdressing fertilizer in cotton fields in stages. Whether or not cotton needs to be pruned has been a long-standing and unresolved issue in the past; some people have also doubted the method of increasing fertilizer and close planting. This year, most areas have recognized that pruning and increasing fertilizer and close planting are important methods for achieving abundance. Qu Yao Li's hometown, Jie County, Shanxi, has a total of 115,000 mu of cotton fields, all of which have been cultivated three times and harrowed eight to nine times; the cotton fields using fine fertilizer, bone fertilizer, and fertilizer powder have increased tenfold compared with last year; the cotton seeds have been carefully selected, and the purity has reached 90%; all cotton fields have implemented Qu Yao Li's full seedling, uniform sowing, and close planting method. The amount of cotton seeds sown per mu has increased by one-third compared with the past, and the number of seedlings left per mu has increased from more than 2,000 plants in the past to about 3,000 plants.
    In order to better promote Qu Yao Li's advanced experience, all localities should pay attention to the following points.
    1. All localities should formulate technical guidance outlines applicable to local conditions based on the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government's instructions on improving cotton cultivation techniques, the cotton abundance guidance outline, and Qu Yao Li's experience (of course, including the experience of local abundance models). This is the primary link in promoting advanced experience. Not only should large administrative regions and provinces formulate such technical guidance outlines, but also agricultural production leadership organs at all levels. Now, large administrative regions such as Northeast, North China, and Southwest, and Shanxi Province, Shandong Province, and Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi Province have put forward technical guidance outlines suitable for local conditions, clearly stipulating which advanced experiences should be promoted immediately in the local area, which experiences need to be tested in the local area before a decision is made, and which experiences are the focus of study and promotion. These technical guidance outlines have a great role in specifically guiding local technical improvements. Because the conditions for agricultural production are relatively complex, and the natural environment and cultivation conditions vary from place to place, when promoting advanced experience, it is necessary to understand its principles and essence, and should not mechanically copy it. For example, Qu Yao Li's experience in preserving moisture and preventing drought and timely sowing can be universally promoted; but some of his specific methods for preserving moisture are not applicable in the Northeast (the Northeast's technical guidance outline has formulated specific methods for preserving moisture suitable for the Northeast). For example, close planting of cotton is an important condition for Qu Yao Li to achieve abundance, but it must be combined with deep plowing, increasing fertilizer, and steadily increasing density, and should not plant more than 3,000 plants per mu regardless of the original situation in the local area.
    2. After the technical guidance outline is formulated, mass technical training should be carried out, which is an important method for learning advanced experience. The technical training classes held in various places from last winter to this spring, and the technical dissemination campaign month currently being held in Hebei Province, are all good methods. Technical training should focus on the vast number of cadres, especially grassroots cadres. Because grassroots cadres are the people who directly lead production, if they cannot deeply understand advanced production experience, it will be difficult for them to organize the masses to learn and adopt advanced technology. For example, village cadres in the fifth township of Sanqiao District, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, initially knew very little about Qu Yao Li's experience, so they could not lead farmers to learn. Later, the district and township cadres in this district studied Qu Yao Li's experience and local cotton planting methods item by item, and then discussed them with all Communist Party members, Youth League members, and mutual aid team leaders, so that the masses accepted Qu Yao Li's advanced experience in watering, deep plowing, close planting, and pruning.
    3. Promoting advanced experience should be carried out continuously from beginning to end according to the production season; the improvement of agricultural tools, water conservancy, fertilizer, and production organization should be closely coordinated with the promotion of advanced experience. Promoting advanced technology is not only a propaganda work, but also an organizational work. The agricultural season is long, and various yield-increasing factors are continuous; therefore, learning advanced experience must be implemented in every agricultural season to achieve the effect of increasing production. For example, this year, most areas have achieved timely sowing of cotton, and many farmers have implemented close planting. The work of applying topdressing fertilizer, watering, controlling pests, and pruning is next. If these tasks are not done well, the certainty of abundance is still not great. In addition, the promotion of advanced experience will inevitably lead to a series of changes in agricultural technology. For example, promoting deep plowing and changing from broadcast sowing to strip sowing in the southern cotton area must first solve the problems of new-style plows, seeders, and the selection of previous crops. To implement close planting, it is necessary to increase the application of fertilizer and pay attention to pruning. To promote the method of frequent and light watering, it is necessary to carry out water conservancy work in places where water conservancy can be increased, and reform irrigation methods in places where water conservancy is already available. The improvement of various agricultural technologies must rely on mutual aid and cooperation organizations to achieve greater results. If this series of tasks cannot be adapted to each other, the abundant experience cannot be well promoted, and may even fail to be promoted. Therefore, promoting advanced experience must be a technical improvement movement that is continuous, uninterrupted, planned, and led, comprehensive, and participated in by the broad masses.
    4. To promote advanced abundance experience, it is necessary to overcome the conservative thinking of cadres and the masses. This cannot be achieved by means of coercion and command. The best way is to educate farmers with visible facts and concrete benefits. It is necessary to give play to the superiority of collective production in state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and set an example of achieving abundance by learning advanced technology. Last year, the cotton fields in the Beijing Shuangqiao State-owned Farm that conducted cotton close planting trials had a yield per mu nearly twice as high as that of the local masses, providing a strong basis for promoting cotton close planting this year.
    At present, the cotton sowing work has ended, and the season for protecting seedlings, applying topdressing fertilizer, pruning, watering, and controlling pests has arrived. Areas that have not yet formulated a cotton technical guidance outline suitable for local needs should hurry up and formulate it; areas that have already formulated such an outline should organize the masses to implement it in a planned manner according to the local production season. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and labor models in various places that have planted cotton should conduct an inspection of the previous stage of cotton planting work, so as to better formulate a production plan for the next stage based on advanced experience and ensure the completion of this year's cotton abundance plan. Because people who seriously adopt advanced experience this year will reap a bumper harvest, advanced experience will be easier to popularize next year.

    有计划地推广曲耀离的棉花丰产经验
    为了普遍地提高棉花的单位面积产量，各产棉区人民政府，正在按照各地具体情况，逐步地推广棉花丰产模范曲耀离的先进经验。
    自去年九月曲耀离棉花丰产的消息发表以后，先后有中央农业部、华北农业科学研究所的人员，河北、平原、河南、山西等省组织的包括农场工作人员、技术干部、农业劳动模范的参观团，解县附近各县的干部、劳动模范和群众，共约五千多人，前往参观曲耀离的丰产棉花。去年十一月中央农业部公布了曲耀离棉花丰产成绩和技术经验的考察报告，全国大部棉区的各级政府，纷纷组织专家、干部、劳动模范学习和讨论了这个报告，同时把它作为教材，在各级劳动模范大会、农业技术训练班、互助组长代表会和农民业余学校中，进行了传达和讲授。去冬今春，山西省各级劳动模范会议和解县附近的群众，亲自听到曲耀离丰产技术报告的也有五千多人。
    今年中央农业部根据曲耀离等人的植棉丰产经验，发布了改进栽培技术，提高单位面积产量的指示；东北、华北、西南、山东、山西等行政区、省及部分专区和县，都根据曲耀离的经验和上级的指示，结合当地丰产模范的经验，批判了当地棉花耕作栽培上的缺点，制订了提高棉花单位面积产量的具体技术指导纲要，这就改变了许多群众认为“政府号召多，具体技术指导少，不能解决问题”的看法，同时使许多技术推广人员，掌握了新的武器。山东德州、胶州专区并将曲耀离的丰产经验印成专册，发给区村干部和劳动模范，作为他们学习的资料。
    毫无疑问，在广大棉区推广曲耀离的丰产经验，对提高棉花的单位面积产量，有极为重要的意义。他的丰产经验，打破了许多人（包括专家、教授、干部和农民群众）的保守观念和生产到顶的思想，使广大棉农增加了提高单位面积产量的信心。一九五○年，当苏联专家介绍苏联每亩棉田产籽棉一千八百斤的情况的时候，许多人都很怀疑；而在学习了曲耀离的丰产经验以后，抱怀疑态度的人是一天比一天减少了。在山东沂水专区丰产座谈会上，有些人最初对曲耀离的产量还很怀疑，他们问：“一亩地产九百斤籽棉，这是什么亩。”经过仔细地学习和研究以后，他们也相信了。长清县植棉能手杨兆新，种棉二十多年，历年每亩产量都是一百斤到二百斤籽棉。他自认为这样的产量已经“到顶”了。学习了曲耀离的经验以后，他找出了自己栽培棉花的毛病，计划把每亩产量提高到三百二十斤籽棉。全国很多互助组，都提出要向曲耀离的棉花产量看齐。
    各地都用曲耀离的经验批判和纠正了当地棉花栽培技术方面的缺点。全国大部棉区正在纠正稀植的思想，稳步地推广密植的办法；许多地区纠正了棉田灌溉中的少浇、饱浇的习惯，推广了轻浇、勤浇的经验。陕西省长安县很多互助组，在学习曲耀离的经验以后，纷纷批判当地棉田整地时冬耕浅、春耕深，浇水时饱浇、少浇，以及不注意整枝等旧的耕作方法。山东的主要棉区传播了曲耀离的经验以后，纠正了当地的棉田不敢施肥（怕长疯）、棉株打顶太早，种棉太稀和没有彻底治蚜等缺点。山东省泗水县植棉能手钟茂林，一九五一年种棉花一亩零三厘，共植棉七百五十株，自认为稀密很适当；经过学习讨论以后，他自动提出今年必须密植到二千株。河北省邯郸县农民宋成全的棉田去年由于施饼肥太多（每亩一千斤），留苗太稀（每亩一千六百株），防治虫害不及时，原订每亩丰产棉花一千斤，结果只收到四百多斤；今年他决心把互助组搞好，学习曲耀离的及时播种、彻底治蚜的办法，并把棉苗提高到每亩三千株，争取产量和曲耀离看齐。
    今年，由于各级党委、政府大力组织学习和推广曲耀离的丰产经验，许多地区的植棉技术提高了一步。例如，各级政府及棉农认识到及时播种，保证全苗是保证丰产的首要关键以后，大多作到了及时耕耙，保墒防旱；加以今春雨水及时，大部地区都作到了适时播种，比去年提早播种五天至半月。很多地区推行了补苗、移苗的办法。以前棉田不施肥及不敢施肥的现象，已开始消除；许多劳动模范都计划在棉田中分期施用追肥。棉花要不要整枝，在过去是一个争执很久而不得解决的问题；增肥密植的方法也曾有人怀疑。今年多数地区都认识到整枝和增肥密植是丰产的重要办法。曲耀离的家乡山西解县，共有十一万五千亩棉田，都耕过三遍，耙耱了八遍到九遍；施用细肥、骨肥和肥田粉的棉田比去年增加了十倍；棉籽都经过精选，纯度达到百分之九十；全部棉田实行了曲耀离的全苗匀种密植方法。每亩播种棉籽比过去增加三分之一，每亩留苗由过去的二千余株，增至三千株左右。
    为了把曲耀离的先进经验推广得更好，各地应该注意以下几点。
    一、各地应根据中央农业部关于改进棉花栽培技术的指示，棉花丰产指导纲要和曲耀离的经验（当然也包括当地丰产模范的经验），制订适用于当地的具体情况的技术指导纲要。这是推广先进经验的首要一环。不但大行政区和省要制订这种技术指导纲要，各级农业生产领导机关，也应该制订。现在东北、华北、西南等大行政区和山西省、山东省、山西省运城专区，已经提出了适合当地的具体情况的技术指导纲要，明确规定了那些先进经验在当地应该马上推广，那些经验需要在当地试验以后再作决定，那些经验是学习推广的重点等。这些技术指导纲要，对具体指导当地技术改进，有很大的作用。因为农业生产的条件比较复杂，各地的自然环境和耕作条件不同，所以，在推广先进经验的时候，要领会它的原则和实质，而不应机械地搬用。比如曲耀离的保墒防旱、及时播种的经验，是可以普遍推广的；但他的具体的保墒方法，有些在东北就不适用（东北区的技术指导纲要已制订了适合东北的具体情况的保墒方法）。再如棉花密植是曲耀离达到丰产的重要条件，但须配合深耕、增肥，稳步地加密，而不应不管当地原来的情况，一律每亩种三千多株。
    二、技术指导纲要制订以后，即进行群众性的技术训练，这是学习先进经验的重要方法。去冬今春各地开办的技术训练班，河北省正在举行的技术传授运动月，都是很好的方法。技术训练应以广大干部、尤其是基层干部为主。因为基层干部是直接领导生产的人，他们如不能深刻体会先进的生产经验，就很难组织群众学习和采用先进的技术。例如，陕西省长安县三桥区五乡的村干部，开始对曲耀离的经验都懂得很少，他们就无法领导农民进行学习。后来，这个区的区乡干部逐条研究了曲耀离的经验和当地的植棉方法，然后和全体共产党员、青年团员、互助组长等在一起讨论，使群众接受了曲耀离的浇水、深耕、密植、整枝等先进经验。
    三、推广先进经验，要自始至终地根据生产季节，不间断地进行；农具、水利、肥料、生产组织的改进，要和推广先进经验密切配合。推广先进技术，不但是一个宣传工作，而且是一个组织工作。农业季节时间较长，各种增产因子又是连贯着的；因此，学习先进经验，必须贯彻到各个农事季节，才能得到增产的效果。比如，今年大部地区的棉花作到了及时播种，很多农民实行了密植，紧接着而来的，还有施用追肥、浇水、防治虫害、整枝等工作。这些工作如果不能做好，丰产的把握仍然不大。另外，推广先进经验也必然要引起农业技术上一系列的变化。例如：推行深耕和在南方棉区推行变撒播为条播的耕作法，这就先要解决新式步犁、播种器和前作物的选择等问题。要实行密植，就要增施肥料，注意整枝。要推广勤浇、轻浇的浇水方法，必须在能增加水利的地方开展水利工作，在已有水利的地方改革灌溉方法。各种农业技术的改进，必须依靠互助合作组织，才能得到更大的效果。如果这一系列的工作不能互相适应，丰产经验就不能很好地推广，甚至会推广不起来。因此，推广先进经验，必须是有始有终的、不间断的、有计划有领导的、全面的、有广大群众参加的技术改进运动。
    四、推广先进丰产经验，要克服干部群众的保守思想。这是不能用强迫命令的方法达到目的的。最好的办法是用看得见的事实和具体的利益教育农民。要发挥国营农场和农业生产合作社、互助组的集体生产的优越性，作出学习先进技术达到丰产的榜样。去年北京双桥国营农场进行棉花密植试验的棉田，每亩产量较当地群众提高将近两倍，对今年推行棉花密植提供了有力的根据。
    目前棉花播种工作已经结束，保苗、施用追肥、整枝、浇水、防治虫害的季节已经到来。还没有订出适合当地需要的棉花技术指导纲要的地区，应当赶快拟订；已订出这种纲要的地区，要按照当地生产季节，有计划地组织群众实行。各地种了棉花的国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和劳动模范，应对前一阶段的植棉工作，进行一次检查，以便更好地根据先进经验，定出下一阶段的生产计划，保证今年棉花丰产计划的完成。因为今年认真采用先进经验的人们得到了丰收，明年先进经验就更加容易普及。
