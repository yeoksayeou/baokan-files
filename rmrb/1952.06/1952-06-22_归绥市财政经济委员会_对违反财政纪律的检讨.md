    Gui Sui City Finance and Economics Committee
    Self-Criticism for Violating Financial Discipline

    Editor: The criticism by Comrade Tang Fu published in the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column regarding the Gui Sui City Finance and Economics Committee's violation of national financial discipline is entirely correct. For the past two years, we have consistently believed that Gui Sui City, as a provincial-level city, could function as a first-level financial entity. In fact, last year's decision by the Government Administration Council on further consolidating urban local finances only stipulated that municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the Greater Administrative Areas could be first-level financial entities. Provincial-level municipalities must be approved by the provincial people's government based on the actual situation before they can function as first-level financial entities. Gui Sui City has never been approved as a first-level financial entity, yet we have referred to ourselves as such, independently managing financial revenue and expenditure, which is a violation of financial discipline.
    The property confiscated from reactionary Taoist sects and secret societies can be used by the provincial people's government as a fund for local welfare undertakings. Gui Sui City, not being a first-level financial entity, has been independently disbursing funds, including "working expenses," which not only violates financial discipline but also encourages corruption and waste. The Public Security Bureau, the court, and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee have used 66 million yuan of property confiscated from the Yiguandao sect, and there has indeed been some waste, for which the relevant responsible comrades have already made a self-criticism. The Public Security Bureau has also made a self-criticism regarding the borrowing of 40 million yuan, guaranteeing that it will not repeat this error in the future.
    The extraction of 80 million yuan in surplus from the New Sui Flour Mill to subsidize organ expenditures was also incorrect. We invested the original working capital of the organs into local enterprises to make money, which demonstrates that we have serious departmentalism, benefiting the smaller collective at the expense of the larger collective, and engaging in muddling through for personal gain.
    The above facts demonstrate that our understanding of financial discipline is insufficient, to the extent that even after being reported, we could not conduct a proper ideological self-criticism. In the future, in addition to establishing a strict inspection system, we will also regularly examine ourselves ideologically in order to better complete the financial and economic tasks for 1952.

### 归绥市财政经济委员会  对违反财政纪律的检讨

    归绥市财政经济委员会
    对违反财政纪律的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报“读者来信”栏所载唐富同志对归绥市财政经济委员会违反国家财政纪律的批评，是完全正确的。两年来，我们始终认为归绥市是个省辖市，可以作为一级财政。事实上去年政务院关于进一步整理城市地方财政的决定中，只确定中央直辖市和大行政区直属市为一级财政，而省辖市须按实际情况，经过省人民政府批准，才能作为一级财政。归绥市一直未被批准为一级财政，而我们自称为一级财政，自理财政收支，是违反财政纪律的。
    对没收的反动道门和会门的财产，省人民政府可用它作为地方福利事业的基金。归绥市不是一级财政，却自行开支，并开支“工作费”，不仅违犯了财政纪律，而且助长了贪污浪费。公安局、法院、市委宣传部动用的没收自一贯道的财产六千六百万元，其中确有部分浪费，有关负责同志对这件事已经作了检讨。公安局对借用四千万元的事情也作了检讨，保证今后不再犯这种错误。
    关于提取新绥面粉厂盈余八千万元补助机关开支的事情，也是错误的。我们把原来机关生产资金投入地方企业去赚钱，这说明我们存在着严重的损大公肥小公，混水摸鱼的本位主义思想。
    以上事实，说明我们对财政纪律的认识是不够的，以致别人检举以后，还不能从思想上很好地进行检讨。今后我们除建立严格的检查制度外，并要经常从思想上检查自己，以便很好地完成一九五二年的财政经济任务。　归绥市财政经济委员会
