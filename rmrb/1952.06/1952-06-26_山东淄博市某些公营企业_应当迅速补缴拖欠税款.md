Certain State-Owned Enterprises in Zibo City, Shandong Province
Should Promptly Pay Overdue Taxes

Dear Editor: The Zibo City State-Owned Coking Bauxite Mine has not yet paid its 1951 annual income tax and its business tax for January to April 1952. Despite repeated reminders from the tax bureau, they have consistently ignored them. According to the central tax law, the business tax for each month must be paid to the national treasury before the 7th of the following month (for example, the tax for May should be paid before June 7th); however, this mine is now more than five months overdue and still has not paid. Similarly, the Boshan Waterworks Department, under the leadership of the Zibo City People's Government Construction Section, is also more than five months overdue in paying its business tax for January to April 1952, and still has not paid despite repeated notices from the tax bureau. In addition, the Zibo Native Produce Sales Station Dasheng Kiln Factory Outlet, the Zibo Liquor Monopoly Bureau, the Zibo Construction Committee (all state-owned), and the Zibo Round Furnace Cooperative also have overdue taxes. Even more seriously, the state-owned Shandong Pottery Factory evaded over 20 million yuan in capital account stamp tax in 1951; the Boshan Business Office of the Luzhong Electric Power Bureau also has tax evasion. I believe that these production units' violations of the state's tax policies and laws, and their failure to pay taxes on time and tax evasion, are extremely inappropriate. Therefore, in addition to suggesting that the above units promptly pay the tax arrears into the treasury, the relevant responsible personnel should also conduct a thorough self-criticism of this issue.

    山东淄博市某些公营企业
    应当迅速补缴拖欠税款
    编辑同志：淄博市公营焦宝石矿一九五一年应缴的全年所得税，及一九五二年一至四月应缴的营业税至今未缴。税局方面虽再三函催，但他们却始终置之不理。按中央税法规定每个月的营业税必须于次月的七日前（例如五月的应在六月七日前缴）解缴国库；但该矿已过期五个月仍不缴纳。再如：淄博市人民政府建设科所领导的博山水道部，一九五二年一至四月份的营业税亦过期五个多月至今仍不缴纳。税局也曾再三函告，但他们至今仍是不理睬。此外，淄博土产运销站大生窑厂门市部、淄博酒业专卖处、淄博建筑委员会（都是公营）和淄博圆炉合作社也都有拖欠税款的情况发生。更严重的是国营山东窑业厂一九五一年曾漏贴资本账簿印花税二千多万元；鲁中电业局博山营业所也有漏税行为。我认为这些生产单位违反国家的税收政策法令，不按期缴税和漏税的行为是极不应当的。因此除建议以上单位迅速将税款补交入库外，有关负责人员并应对此问题进行深刻检讨。张悦朴
