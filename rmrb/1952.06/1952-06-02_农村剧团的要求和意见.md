    Requirements and Opinions of Rural Theatrical Troupes

    Editor: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, many articles by literary and art workers have been published in the newspapers. These articles are mostly based on Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction to examine themselves. We welcome this practice. I think workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places should express more opinions for the reference of literary and art workers.

    I feel that what is most lacking in the countryside now are short and pithy works that reflect the lives and production of peasants, especially ballads, clappercracks, and plays that can be sung. Taking the 11th District of Beijing as an example, there are nearly 40 new and old theatrical troupes, Yangge teams, and opera troupes in the 51 villages of the district. These peasant cultural and recreational organizations are all urgently requesting that they be supplied with materials and helped. Amateur old opera troupes also need to discard the old and stage new scripts. In order to find scripts, everyone has run to bookstores in the city countless times, but still can't find them. The work of helping peasants develop cultural and artistic activities is also very poor. For example, there are many rural theatrical troupes in the suburbs of Beijing, but too few receive help. Many of us hope that literary and art workers can sacrifice some rest time on Sundays and go to the countryside to help us. When the Central Academy of Drama and the Youth Art Theatre sent people to Nanyuan to help the literary and art group rehearse plays, the group was improved in all aspects. Everyone is looking forward to literary and art workers going to the countryside, and even more welcome them to perform in the countryside.

    Finally, we want to give an opinion to the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Literary and Art Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League. Whenever they need rural theatrical troupes (such as for performances), they grab our theatrical troupes, and then they don't care about us afterwards. This temporary approach is not helpful to us.

    农村剧团的要求和意见
    编辑同志：纪念毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表十周年的时候，报上发表了很多文艺工作者的文章，这些文章大都是根据毛主席所指示的文艺方向来检查自己，我们欢迎这种作法。我认为各地的工人、农民和战士应该多表示一些意见，供文艺工作者作参考。
    我觉得现在农村最感缺乏的，是短小精悍的反映农民生活、生产的作品，特别是能演唱的鼓词、快板、剧本等。拿北京市第十一区来说，全区五十一个村子，有新旧剧团、秧歌队、戏班子近四十个，这些农民的文娱组织都迫切要求供给他们材料并帮助他们。业余的旧戏班子也需要扔掉旧的东西，排演新剧本。为了找剧本，大家往城里的书店不知跑了多少次，结果还是找不到。帮助农民开展文艺活动的工作也是很差的。比如北京郊区的农村剧团很多，而受到帮助的却太少了。我们很多人希望文艺工作者在星期日能牺牲点休息时间，下乡来帮助我们。中央戏剧学院、青年艺术剧院派人到南苑帮助文艺小组排剧时，曾使该组在各方面得到改进。大家都盼望文艺工作者下乡，更欢迎他们下乡来演出。
    最后，我们要给北京市文学艺术界联合会及北京市新民主主义青年团工作委员会文艺部提个意见。他们每逢用得着农村剧团的时候（如搞会演），就把我们剧团抓一下，过后就不闻不问了。这种临时抓一把的做法对我们是没有帮助的。
