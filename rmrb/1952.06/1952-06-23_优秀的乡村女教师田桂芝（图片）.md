Excellent Rural Female Teacher Tian Guizhi

    (I) Victory Village, Yongsheng Tun, Dunhua County, Jilin Province, is a plain surrounded by mountains, with the rushing Mudanjiang River winding through it. Groups of farmers are working in the vast fields piled with manure, happily humming newly learned songs: "Mao Zedong, Stalin, shine like the sun in the sky..."
    (II) But in the early days of liberation in Yongsheng Tun, the vast majority of farmers were illiterate, and they had to ask others to write a letter or a couplet.
    (III) In the spring of 1948, a new thing suddenly spread throughout the village: "Guizhi from the old Tian family is back and wants to start a school in our village!" Some people said: "Oh! Can a seventeen-year-old girl teach?"

    （一）吉林省敦化县胜利村永胜屯是一片为群山环绕着的平原，牡丹江的急流从这里蜿蜒而过。一组一组的农民正在那堆满粪肥的辽阔田地上劳动着，愉快地哼着新学的歌儿：“毛泽东，斯大林，像太阳在天空照……”
    （二）但在永胜屯初解放时，屯里绝大部分农民都是文盲，写封信或写一副对联都得求别人。
    （三）一九四八年春天，屯里忽然传遍了一个新鲜事儿：“老田家的桂芝回来了，要给咱屯里办学呢！”有的就说：“哟！十七岁的毛丫头也能教学！”
