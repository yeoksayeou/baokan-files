For more than a year, various factories in Shenyang have been promoting high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods.

In ten major state-owned machine manufacturing factories in Shenyang, an average of 85 percent of Soviet machine tools, 70 percent of domestically produced machine tools, and 60 percent of belt lathes have adopted high-speed cutting, rapid cutting, and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods. Due to the adoption of these advanced working methods, the speed of motor lathes generally reaches 500 to 800 revolutions per minute, with the highest reaching 1,200 revolutions per minute. The cutting speed per minute generally reaches about 130 meters, with the highest reaching 800 meters. Cutting efficiency has generally increased by one to five times compared to before the implementation of these advanced working methods, and a few have increased by up to seventeen times.

Because of the widespread implementation of these advanced working methods, the overall production efficiency of various machine factories has increased compared to the past. In the first quarter of this year, the processing workshop of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant implemented high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods and organized joint teams, which increased output by nearly four times compared to the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year. Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant increased its output in April of this year by three times compared to August of last year due to the widespread adoption of these advanced cutting methods and the implementation of "organized rhythmic production according to instruction charts."

However, more than 30 percent of the machine tools in the city have not yet adopted these advanced cutting methods. Among the machine tools that have adopted high-speed cutting, only one-third of them truly give full play to the effectiveness of high-speed cutting; two-thirds of the machine tools only achieve the effect of rapid cutting, which is still far from true high-speed cutting. And the production quality and production efficiency of most factories have not been improved to a level commensurate with the cutting rate.

So, what are the urgent problems that need to be solved in the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods? And how should these problems be solved?

First, some cadres have not realized that the adoption of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods is a major reform in the technology of the machine manufacturing industry. Some cadres believe that promoting these advanced experiences is an easy task, and therefore have not carried out arduous and concrete organizational work, and have not paid attention to and supported the promotion work. The leading cadres of individual factories even disbanded the high-speed cutting promotion team and transferred the cadres in it to other departments. Some leading cadres of factories have pitted the promotion of these advanced experiences against the completion of production tasks, believing that "completing tasks comes first, and promoting advanced experiences comes second." In fact, they are using "completing tasks" as an excuse to cancel the work of promoting advanced experiences. Some cadres are afraid that after adopting high-speed cutting, there will be work stoppages due to lack of materials, which will cause imbalances between various processes and affect rhythmic production. Some cadres are afraid that the implementation of multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods will inevitably require the setting up of various tools and fixtures, which will increase product costs. Some administrative cadres believe that promoting advanced experiences is the responsibility of the trade union, and the administrative side is only "producing step by step," so they do not help workers solve the difficulties encountered in the promotion work. Some trade union cadres have not actively asked the leading cadres of the Party and administrative departments for support, simply complaining that others "do not pay attention," and are helpless in the face of difficulties. In order to earnestly promote these advanced working methods, the above-mentioned ideological obstacles must be overcome. Factories should overcome these ideological obstacles and strengthen ideological and organizational leadership by organizing performances, visits, and various symposiums; establish and improve the "Advanced Experience Promotion Committee," make a practical and feasible promotion plan for a certain period, and carry out promotion work in an organized and step-by-step manner.

Second, some workers have not yet mastered the basic theoretical knowledge of high-speed cutting; the old production management and technical management systems have conflicted with the new situations that have emerged after the promotion of high-speed cutting.

The experience of Shenyang No. 6 Machine Tool Plant in solving this problem is worth learning. The leading cadres of the plant attach great importance to and support the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods. They first conducted technical theoretical knowledge education on high-speed cutting for workers, and with the workers who graduated from the high-speed cutting training class as the backbone, they organized amateur technical learning classes throughout the plant to specially teach the theory of high-speed cutting, so that workers could master the basic theoretical knowledge of high-speed cutting in a timely manner. They promptly organized technicians to participate in this work and asked technicians to formulate technical operating procedures related to high-speed cutting. They asked technicians to go deep into the front line, continuously conduct technical theoretical education for workers, and help workers solve technical difficulties. They planned to set up more than 160 kinds of tools and fixtures related to the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting. Technicians and workers combined to transform belt lathes and overcome the difficulties of insufficient power and heating of the bushings when performing high-speed cutting on belt lathes. This greatly promoted the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods.

Third, strengthen the management of cemented carbide tools to ensure the rational use of cemented carbide tools. At present, our country is very short of cemented carbide tools, and various units are very wasteful when using this kind of tool. This situation has already produced two bad results: First, because cemented carbide tools cannot be bought, high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods cannot be implemented frequently; second, because the loss of cemented carbide tools is too great, although cutting efficiency has been improved, the processing cost has also increased. To solve this problem, in addition to strengthening political education for workers so that they understand the great significance of saving cemented carbide tools for our country's economic construction, we must also establish a strict system for the receipt, return, and storage of cemented carbide tools in order to rationally use cemented carbide tools; and we must establish a unified tool grinding system, set up special personnel for tool grinding, and solve the equipment problems for tool grinding. This is a problem that must and can be solved in the current vigorous promotion of high-speed cutting methods.

Fourth, production using high-speed cutting methods requires relatively skilled operating techniques and technical theoretical knowledge, and requires relatively high labor intensity. This is a new problem that has arisen in the promotion of high-speed cutting work. Therefore, properly resolving the wage issue for workers and rewarding those workers who have made outstanding achievements is an important task for further promoting high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods.

Finally, there is a long-standing but unresolved problem: work stoppages due to lack of materials constantly occur in the process of promoting high-speed cutting methods. The casting workshop and forging workshop cannot supply processing parts, which affects the mood of workers who adopt high-speed cutting. Some workers said: "I dare not implement high-speed cutting, because once I implement it, I will have no work to do in the afternoon." The solution to this problem is to promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts." In this regard, Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant has already made good achievements.

### 进一步推广高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法

    进一步推广高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法
    沈阳各工厂推广高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，已有一年多了。
    沈阳市十个主要的国营机器制造厂，平均有百分之八十五的苏联机床，百分之七十的国产机床和百分之六十的皮带车床，采用了高速切削、快速切削和多刀多刃切削法。由于采用了这些先进的工作法，马达车床的转速，一般都达到每分钟五百转到八百转，最高的达到了一千二百转。每分钟的切削速度，一般的达到一百三十公尺左右，最高的达到八百公尺。切削效率比没有实行这些先进工作法以前，一般的提高了一倍到五倍，少数的提高到十七倍。
    因为广泛地实行了这些先进的工作法，各机器工厂的综合生产效率，都比过去提高了。沈阳第一机器厂加工车间，在今年第一季度，实行了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，组织了联合小组，使产量比去年第四季初提高了将近四倍。第三机器厂由于普遍地采用了这些先进切削法和实行了“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”，今年四月份的产量比去年八月份的产量提高了三倍。
    但是，该市还有百分之三十以上的机床，没有采用这些先进的切削方法。在已经采用高速切削法的机床中，只有三分之一的机床真正充分发挥了高速切削的效能；三分之二的机床只收到快速切削的效果，离真正的高速切削还很远。而大部分工厂的生产品和生产效率，并没有提高到和切削率相适应的程度。
    那末，在推广高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法的工作中，究竟还有那些急需解决的问题呢？这些问题应该怎样来解决呢？
    第一、有一部分干部，没有认识到采用高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，这是机器制造工业技术上的重大改革。有的干部认为推广这些先进经验是轻而易举的事，因而没有进行艰苦的具体的组织工作，没有重视和支持推广工作。个别厂的领导干部，竟解散了高速切削法推广小组，而把其中的干部调到别的部门去。还有些厂的领导干部，把推广这些先进经验和完成生产任务对立起来，认为“完成任务第一，推广先进经验第二”。实际上，他们是藉口
    “完成任务”，把推广先进经验的工作取消了。有的干部害怕采用了高速切削法以后，会发生停工待料现象，引起各工序间的不平衡，影响了有节奏的生产。有些干部害怕实行多刀多刃切削法必然设置各种刀具、卡具，会提高产品成本。有的行政干部认为推广先进经验是工会的事，行政方面只是
    “按步就班地生产”，因此就不去帮助职工解决在推广工作中遇到的困难问题。有一部分工会干部，没有主动地要求党、行政方面的领导干部加以支持，单纯埋怨别人“不重视”，在困难面前束手无策。为了认真地推广这些先进工作法，必须克服上述各种思想障碍。各厂应该通过组织表演、参观、召开各种座谈会等方式，克服这些思想障碍，加强思想和组织领导；建立并健全“先进经验推广委员会”，作出一定时期的切实可行的推广计划，有组织有步骤地进行推广工作。
    第二、有些工人还没有掌握高速切削法的基本理论知识；旧的生产管理及技术管理制度，和推广高速切削法以后出现的新情况发生了矛盾。
    沈阳第六机器厂解决这个问题的经验，是值得学习的。该厂的领导干部十分重视和支持推广高速切削和多刀多刃切削法。他们首先对工人进行高速切削法的技术理论知识的教育，以在高速切削法训练班毕业的工人为骨干，组织全厂范围的业余技术学习班，专门教授高速切削的理论，使工人及时地掌握高速切削法的基本理论知识。他们及时地组织技术人员参加这一工作，请技术人员制订有关高速切削法的技术操作规程。他们请技术人员深入现场，不断地向工人进行技术理论教育，帮助工人解决技术方面的困难。他们有计划地设置了有关推广高速切削和多刀多刃切削的工具、卡具达一百六十多种。技术人员和工人相结合，改造了皮带车床，克服了在皮带车床上进行高速切削时动力不足和轴瓦发热的困难。这就大大促进了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法的推广工作。
    第三、加强硬质合金刀的管理，保证硬质合金刀的合理使用。目前我国非常缺乏硬质合金刀，而各单位在使用这种刀时又十分浪费。这种情况已经产生两种不好的结果：一、因买不到硬质合金刀，不能经常地实行高速切削和多刀多刃切削法；二、因硬质合金刀的损失太大，虽然提高了切削效率，但同时提高了加工成本。要解决这个问题，除了加强对工人的政治教育，使他们明了节约硬质合金刀对我们祖国经济建设的重大意义之外，还必须建立严格的硬质合金刀的领取、交还、保管制度，以合理使用硬质合金刀；并须建立统一磨刀制度，设专人磨刀，并解决磨刀的设备问题。这是当前大力推广高速切削法工作中必须解决和能够解决的问题。
    第四、用高速切削法进行生产，需要比较熟练的操作技术和技术理论知识，需要比较高的劳动强度。这是在推广高速切削工作中所产生的新问题。因此，适当地解决工人的工资问题，奖励那些成绩卓越的工人，是进一步推广高速切削和多刀多刃切削法的重要工作。
    最后还有一个长期存在而没有解决的问题，就是在推广高速切削法的过程中，不断有停工待料现象发生。铸造车间、锻造车间供不上加工部件，影响了采用高速切削的工人情绪。有的工人说：“不敢实行高速切削，因为一实行了，下午就没有活干了。”解决这一问题的办法，就是推广苏联的“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进经验。在这方面，沈阳第三机器厂已经作出了良好的成绩。
