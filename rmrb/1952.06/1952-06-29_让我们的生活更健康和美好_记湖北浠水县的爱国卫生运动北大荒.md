    Let's Make Our Lives Healthier and More Beautiful
    -- On the Patriotic Health Campaign in Xishui County, Hubei Province
    Bei Da Huang
    Just as the wheat is ripening, the seedlings are growing strong, and the white flowers of the bottle gourds are blooming all over the fields, a patriotic health campaign has swept across Xishui County, from the mountains to the plains, from towns to villages. People want to use the health campaign to fight back against the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare, and thereby improve their own health, making their lives more fulfilling and happier.

    In the town of Chengguan, more than two thousand men, women, and children were mobilized to sweep the ground clean, both indoors and outdoors. Lime and sand were sprinkled in damp corners, and wooden covers were added to the toilets. The streets, paved with foreign sand and stone slabs, were as clean as if they had been washed with water. The dirty and muddy alleys that used to reek with foul odors have also been completely transformed. Low walls have been built along the roadsides to prevent soil from flowing onto the streets due to rain erosion. The swept streets are covered with a layer of yellow sand. The sunlight shines on it, shimmering with a golden light.

    In the countryside, although it is the busy farming season, with everyone busy removing insects, weeding fields, applying fertilizer, operating waterwheels, and hoeing weeds, health work has not been neglected. The women of all 184 townships in the county, having just put down their sickles and flails, picked up brooms and shovels again. According to the memories of the elderly in Zhengjiawan in Hedong Township, the ditches in the village had never been cleaned before; now, under the leadership of Li Cuiying, the head of the women's group, the accumulated dirt of many years has been cleared. Many farmers used to only sprinkle a layer of yellow soil in front of their doors during the New Year (Spring Festival); now the villages are covered with yellow sand, making the tranquil farms even more beautiful. Every day, a group of young women walks through each village. These are the members of the women's hygiene inspection team, who are conscientiously carrying out their work. If they see any place that is slightly unclean, they offer suggestions.

    On the Dragon Boat Festival, racing dragon boats sped along the Xishui River. The banks of the river were crowded with spectators, and brand-new, colorful clothes set off the riverbanks like a springtime full of flowers. Right there on the sun-baked sandy beach, the Young Pioneers of Xishui Middle School, carrying red flags and propaganda posters against bacteriological warfare, used skits and antiphonal singing to tell the masses about the heinous crimes of American imperialism, and encouraged everyone to further improve sanitation work.

    Looking at the children's flushed faces, looking at the rice seedlings in the fields growing against the wind, and looking at the dragon boats racing on the river, how can people allow the American wolves to extend their plague-ridden claws to destroy our happy lives!

    Since the beginning of summer, the county's sanitation work has entered a new climax, becoming a central task that is well-known and understood by every household, and is being earnestly implemented. Patriotic health competitions have been widely carried out in all townships throughout the county. Panlong Township mobilized more than 300 people and caught more than 1,400 rats in three days. In the past, due to the long-term rule of the feudal class in rural areas, farmers were oppressed by poverty, and a single room served as both bedroom and kitchen, and sometimes even the toilet was inside. Now, women have broken free from feudal constraints and have moved their toilets outside.

    After carrying out sanitation work in the countryside, there is also an additional benefit, which is the increase in the source of topdressing fertilizer for rice paddies. The dust swept from the roofs, the moist soil dug from the corners of the houses, the ash from the streets, and the dregs from the kitchens are all good fertilizers. The women of the Ninth Natural Village of Nanyue Township swept up 8,600 jin of dust and dregs in one morning; the Zhu Meiying Women's Mutual Aid Group in Sandian Township, while doing a good job of environmental sanitation, also paid attention to accumulating fertilizer, collecting more than 70 dan of brick soil, dust, etc., which is equivalent to 2,000 jin of vegetable cakes. They said, "This is sanitation and fertilizer accumulation, killing two birds with one stone."

    This year, under the slogan of "Increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the farmers of Xishui County have launched a county-wide patriotic bumper harvest competition, with plans for more than 10,000 mu of rice paddies to yield 1,000 jin per mu. Now, the rice seedlings in the paddy fields are growing well, and a gust of wind blows, rolling endless green waves, which is a forecast of golden grains filling the granaries after autumn! The people of Xishui are confident in achieving a double victory on the production front and the sanitation front, so that the shameless conspiracy of American imperialism will be completely bankrupt, and so that our lives will be healthier and more beautiful!

    让我们的生活更健康和美好
    ——记湖北浠水县的爱国卫生运动
    北大荒
    正当麦子透熟、秧苗茁壮、戽子瓜的白花开满田园的时候，浠水全县，从山地到平原，从城镇到乡村，到处掀起了爱国卫生运动。人们要用卫生运动来回击美国侵略者的细菌战，并从而提高自己的健康水平，使自己的生活更加美满，更加幸福。
    城关镇发动了男女老幼两千多人，从室内到室外，把地面扫得干干净净。阴湿的角落里洒上了石灰和砂土，厕所加上了木盖。在街道上，洋砂、石片的路面，像水冲洗过一样洁净。过去脏污泥泞，散发着恶臭的小巷，现在也完全变样了。路边砌起了矮墙，让泥土不致因雨水冲洗而流到街面上来。扫净的街道上都铺上了一层黄砂。太阳光射在上面，闪动着金色的光。
    在农村，虽然是农忙季节，大家忙着除虫、薅田、追肥、车水、锄草，但也没有放松卫生工作。全县一百八十四个乡的妇女群众，刚放下镰刀和连笳，又拿起了扫帚和铁铲。河东乡郑家塆的屋沟，据塆里老年人的记忆，从没看见打扫过；现在在妇女组长李翠英的带头下，把积存多年的灰土清除了。许多农民过去只有过年（春节）时才在门前洒上一层黄土；现在村里到处铺满黄砂，使恬静的农庄显得更美丽。每天，每个塆子里都要走过一群年轻的妇女。这是妇女清洁卫生检查组的组员，在认真地执行自己的工作。她们看到任何地方稍为有些不清洁，就提出意见。
    端午节那天，浠河里奔驰着竞赛的龙舟。河两岸挤满参观的群众，崭新的五彩颜色的衣服，把河岸衬托得像满开花朵的春天。就在那烈日照射的沙滩上，浠水中学的少年儿童队员们打着红旗，扛着反对细菌战的宣传画，用活报和对唱形式，向群众讲述美帝国主义的滔天罪行，并鼓舞大家进一步做好清洁卫生工作。
    看着孩子们涨红的脸，看着田野里迎风上长的稻苗，看着河面上驰骋的龙舟，人们怎能允许美国狼伸出瘟疫的爪子来破坏我们的幸福生活呢！
    入夏以后，全县的卫生工作又进入了一个新的高潮，它已成为家喻户晓、人人皆知，而且被切实执行的中心任务。全县各乡普遍开展了爱国卫生竞赛。盘龙乡在三天内发动群众三百多人，捕捉了老鼠一千四百多只。过去农村中由于长期被封建阶级统治，贫困压迫着农民，一间房子里又是寝室，又是厨房，有的连厕所也在里面。如今，妇女打破了封建束缚，纷纷把厕所搬到屋外。
    农村里开展清洁卫生工作以后，还有一个附带的收获，这就是增加了稻田追肥的来源。从房顶上扫下的扬尘，从屋角里刨下的潮湿地皮，街上的灰土和厨房的渣滓，都是很好的肥料。南岳乡第九自然村的妇女，一个早晨就扫集了扬尘、渣末八千六百多斤；三店乡朱美英妇女互助组，一面搞好环境卫生，一面注意积肥，共收集了砖土、扬尘等七十多担，能抵菜饼两千斤。她们说：“这是卫生、积肥，一举两得。”
    今年，浠水县农民在“增加生产，厉行节约，支援中国人民志愿军”的口号下，全县展开了爱国丰产竞赛运动，计划产量达一千斤的稻田在万亩以上。现在，水田里的稻苗长得正好，一阵风吹过去，翻滚着无边无尽的绿浪，这便是秋后金黄谷粒盈仓的预告！浠水人民有信心取得生产战线和卫生战线上的两重胜利，让美帝国主义的无耻阴谋，全部破产，让我们的生活更健康和美好！
