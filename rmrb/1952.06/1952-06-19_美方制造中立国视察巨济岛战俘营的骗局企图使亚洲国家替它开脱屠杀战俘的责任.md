Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. The American aggressors' atrocities of slaughtering Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have aroused great anger among the people of the world. In order to deceive world opinion, the American aggressors are actively arranging a fraudulent scheme of so-called "military observers from five neutral countries to investigate the management of the Geoje Island POW camp."

This scheme was put forward by US President Truman on the 11th in the form of a "suggestion" to the US Department of Defense. On the 13th, US Deputy Secretary of Defense Foster replied to Truman, saying that the Department of Defense, in accordance with Truman's suggestion and after consultation with the State Department, was making "necessary preparations." At the same time, the US State Department was exerting diplomatic influence on the five countries that Truman intended to "invite," namely India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Sweden, and Switzerland, in an attempt to induce them to accept this so-called "suggestion." A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 14th revealed that the State Department had "invited" representatives of the above five countries on the 13th to "discuss" the issue. The dispatch also stated that once the governments of these countries indicated their attitude, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie would issue a formal letter of invitation.

This scheme, praised by the reactionary American newspapers as a "clever suggestion," is clearly not clever at all. Anyone with a little political experience can see that this is just a clumsy means by the American aggressors to use these countries to cover up their barbaric crimes. Truman himself and the American bourgeois newspapers do not deny this. When making this suggestion, Truman believed that this method of "having senior military observers from neutral countries go to Geoje Island to refute the 'large number of lies' about the Allied forces mistreating Communist prisoners of war that the 'Communist propaganda machine is broadcasting to the world'" had "many advantages" (Associated Press, Washington, 11th). The *San Francisco Chronicle* stated in its editorial that "simply allowing a group of observers to observe would shatter the Communist claim that the UN forces are 'systematically violating' the Geneva Conventions on Geoje Island" (US Information Service, Washington, 16th). The *New York Times* on the 13th greatly praised the fraudulent scheme of inviting Asian countries to conduct a so-called "investigation." The newspaper said, "Putting India, Indonesia, and Pakistan at the top of the list of countries invited to investigate Geoje Island is a clever and correct approach." From these remarks, one can clearly see that even before this "neutral country military observer" investigation team is formed, the American aggressors have already prescribed its task in advance. This task is to exonerate the American aggressors from their heinous crimes of violating the Geneva Conventions and using massacre methods to screen and detain prisoners of war. Because those being mistreated and slaughtered by the United States are Chinese and Korean prisoners, they have specifically selected Asian countries to conduct the "visit" in an attempt to deceive and hoodwink the Asian people.

People still remember that a month ago, when the Dodd and Colson incidents revealed the truth about the American aggressors' slaughter and persecution of prisoners of war, the extremely embarrassed Truman and Acheson dared not talk about the issue. Acheson said at a press conference that it would be "unwise for the State Department to issue any statement" on the matter. However, less than a month later, both Truman and the State Department have come out to actively intervene in the issue of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. What factors prompted Truman and Acheson to suddenly become "smart"? People only need to look at the events that have occurred on Geoje Island in the past month to know why Truman put forward this "clever method" precisely after the bloody massacre on Geoje Island on June 10.

In the past month, the American aggressors have been working hard on Geoje Island to destroy all traces and evidence of their crimes of slaughtering and persecuting our captured personnel, and are preparing and manufacturing a set of things for the "neutral country military observers" to observe. This is the "necessary preparation work" referred to by US Deputy Secretary of Defense Foster. Since the executioner Boatner took office, the residents of Geoje Island who had witnessed the atrocities of the US side were driven away; the news blockade against American journalists was even tighter; American tanks and infantry rushed into the prisoner-of-war camps, dismantling and burning the torture chambers, steam rooms, and gallows set up by the US side in the prisoner-of-war camps. This work of destroying evidence by the US side reached its climax with the bloody massacre on June 10. In this massacre, the American aggressors launched a large-scale attack on our unarmed captured personnel with various weapons, killing hundreds of our captured personnel, forcing the prisoners of war to small camps, in groups of ten, under the closer surveillance of US secret agents, and moving more prisoners of war away from Geoje Island to other more distant islands or the Korean mainland; at the same time, the original prisoner-of-war camps were "burned to the ground," destroying all evidence.

After this, the US side successively dispersed our captured personnel from the original prisoner-of-war camps to new small camps, and claimed that the original camps would be "cleaned up." Subsequently, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities used the American news agency to spread rumors, preposterously claiming that the bodies of their comrades, who had been killed by American executioners and buried in the camps by our captured personnel, were "killed" by our captured personnel themselves, in an attempt to use this shameless conspiracy of "planting evidence and making false accusations" to wash away their bloodstained evidence of crimes.

Obviously, Truman put forward this so-called method of investigation by neutral country "observers" after he believed that the prisoners of war were under his bloody control and that he was confident in destroying the evidence.

Observers here point out that Truman's self-deceiving method cannot deceive anyone. Truman may be able to destroy corpses and eliminate evidence on Geoje Island, but Truman cannot destroy the confession of American General Colson, which is written in black and white. More and more news proves that the various crimes of slaughter, persecution, and forced "screening" of our captured personnel confessed by Colson are all facts. Even Colson himself admitted that there was nothing untrue about what he had admitted. In the face of such ironclad facts that cannot be overturned by any denial or statement, no upright government or kind individual will be fooled by the American aggressors. Acting as a tool for the American aggressors to cover up their crimes will only stain oneself with the stench of blood.

Observers further pointed out that the American imperialists, who have always regarded the Asian people as objects of enslavement and plunder, after carrying out a massacre with horrifying and brutal means in an attempt to detain prisoners of war, now want to drive Asian countries to harm their friendship with the Chinese and Korean people in order to exonerate themselves. This arrogant conspiracy of the American imperialists, who regard Asians as deceivable, is a great insult to all Asian countries and all Asian people, and is absolutely intolerable to all Asians with self-esteem. This shameless fraud by the American aggressors is bound to suffer a shameful failure.

    美方制造中立国视察巨济岛战俘营的骗局企图使亚洲国家替它开脱屠杀战俘的责任
    【新华社开城十八日电】美国侵略者屠杀朝中战俘的暴行，已经引起了全世界人民的极大愤怒。为了欺骗世界舆论，美国侵略者正在积极布置所谓“由五个中立国的军事观察家去调查巨济岛战俘营的管理情况”的骗局。
    这个骗局是由美国总统杜鲁门在十一日以“建议”形式向美国国防部提出的。十三日，美国国防部副部长浮斯特复信给杜鲁门说：国防部遵照杜鲁门的意见，在和国务院商议以后，正在进行“必要的准备”。与此同时，美国国务院就对杜鲁门准备“邀请”的印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、瑞典、瑞士等五个国家运用外交影响，想诱使它们接受这个所谓“建议”。合众社华盛顿十四日电透露，国务院在十三日“邀请”上述五国的代表们“商讨”了这个问题。该消息还说：一俟这些国家政府表明态度之后，联合国秘书长赖伊就将发出正式的邀请书。
    这个被美国反动报纸称赞为“聪明的建议”的骗局，显然是一点也不聪明的。稍有政治经验的人们都可以看穿，这只是美国侵略者企图利用这些国家来掩饰其野蛮罪行的拙劣手段。关于这一点，就是杜鲁门自己以及美国的资产阶级报纸都毫不讳言。杜鲁门在提出这个建议时就认为，这个“由中立国派高级军事观察员到巨济岛去，以驳斥‘共产党宣传机器正向世界广播的’关于联军虐待共军战俘的‘大量谎言’”的办法有“许多优点”（美联社华盛顿十一日电）。“旧金山纪事报”在其社论中指出，“只要允许一个观察团去观察，就可以打破共方所说的联合国军正在巨济岛上‘有计划地破坏’日内瓦公约的说法”（美国新闻处华盛顿十六日电）。十三日的“纽约时报”更大为赞赏邀请亚洲国家进行所谓“调查”的骗局。该报说：“把印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦列入被邀请往巨济岛调查的名单的首位是很聪明而正确的办法。”人们从这些言论中已经可以清楚地看到，美国侵略者甚至在这个“中立国军事观察家”的调查团还没有组成之前，就已经预先为它规定了任务。这任务就是要替美国侵略者破坏日内瓦公约和以屠杀手段来甄别并扣留战俘的滔天罪行开脱罪责。由于美国所正在加以虐待和屠杀的是中国和朝鲜的被俘人员，因此，他们特别选中了用亚洲国家去进行“访问”，企图借此来欺骗和蒙蔽亚洲人民。
    人们都还记得在一个月以前，当杜德、柯尔生事件使美国侵略者屠杀迫害战俘的真相大白于世的时候，尴尬万分的杜鲁门和艾奇逊都不敢谈这个问题。艾奇逊在一次记者招待会上说，对于这个问题，“国务院如果发表任何声明是不智的”。可是时间过了不到一个月，杜鲁门和国务院却都出来积极地过问巨济岛俘虏营的问题了。究竟是些什么因素促使杜鲁门和艾奇逊忽然“聪明”起来了呢？人们只要看一看最近一个月来巨济岛上所发生的事件，就可以知道为什么杜鲁门恰恰在巨济岛上六月十日的血腥屠杀事件以后提出了这个“聪明的办法”。
    在过去一个月里，美国侵略者在巨济岛上紧张地进行了毁灭一切屠杀迫害我方被俘人员的罪迹和证据的工作，并且正在准备和制造一套供“中立国军事观察家”观察的东西。这就是美国国防部副部长浮斯特所称的“必要的准备工作”。自从刽子手波纳上任以后，曾经亲眼目睹美方暴行的巨济岛上的居民被赶走了；对美国新闻记者的新闻封锁也更严密了；美国的坦克和步兵冲进战俘营里，拆掉和烧掉了美方设在战俘营中的酷刑室、蒸气间和绞刑架。美方这种毁灭罪证的工作到六月十日的血腥大屠杀达到了最高点。在这次屠杀中，美国侵略者用各种武器对赤手空拳的我方被俘人员发动了大规模的进攻，杀害了数百名我方被俘人员，把战俘强迫送到小营场里去，十个人一组，受美方特务的更严密的监视，把更多的战俘迁离巨济岛，送到更远的其他岛屿或朝鲜大陆上去；同时把原来的战俘营场“烧得精光”，毁灭了一切罪证。
    在这以后，美方就陆续将原来各战俘营中的我方被俘人员分散到新的小营场去，并扬言要把原来的各营场加以“清理”。随着，美方俘虏营当局就通过美国通讯社大事造谣，把被美国刽子手杀害而由我方被俘人员掩埋在营场里的他们的同伴的尸首，荒谬绝伦地硬说是我方被俘人员自己“杀害”的，企图用这种“栽赃诬控”的无耻阴谋，来洗刷自己的血迹斑斑的罪证。
    显然，杜鲁门是在自以为战俘在其血腥控制之下，不可能有所申诉，对于毁灭罪证又有了把握之后，才提出这个所谓由中立国“观察家”调查的办法来的。
    此间观察家指出：杜鲁门这种自欺欺人的办法是骗不了谁的。杜鲁门尽管可以在巨济岛上毁尸灭迹，消灭罪证；可是杜鲁门却无法销毁黑字写在白纸上的美国将军柯尔生的供词。愈来愈多的消息证明了柯尔生所招供的对我方被俘人员所进行的种种屠杀迫害、强迫“甄别”的罪行都是事实。就连柯尔生自己也供认他所承认的没有任何不真实的事情。在这样铁一般的、任何否认和声明都推翻不了的事实面前，任何正直的政府和善良的个人，决不会受美国侵略者的愚弄。给美国侵略者充当掩饰罪行的工具，因而使自己也染上一身膻腥。
    观察家进一步指出：一向把亚洲人民看作奴役和掠夺对象的美帝国主义者，在用骇人听闻的残暴手段进行大屠杀企图借此扣留战俘以后，竟然又想驱使亚洲国家危害他们对中朝人民的友谊，来替它开脱责任。美帝国主义者这种以亚洲人为可欺的狂妄阴谋，是对于一切亚洲国家和全体亚洲人民的极大侮辱，是一切有自尊心的亚洲人所绝对不能容忍的。美国侵略者这个无耻的骗局，必然要遭到可耻的失败。
