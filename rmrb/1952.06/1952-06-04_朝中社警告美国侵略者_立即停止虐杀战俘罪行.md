    Korean Central News Agency Warns American Aggressors
    Immediately Stop the Crime of Massacring Prisoners of War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 2nd entitled "American Aggressors Must Immediately Stop the Retaliatory Massacre of Our Captured Personnel," stating: The American aggressors are panicked by the thorough exposure of their "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy by the just and heroic struggle of our captured personnel, but the aggressors are cruelly murdering our captured personnel by even more brutal and insidious means. The commentary said that the fact that another bloody crime by the aggressors in killing and wounding sixty of our captured personnel on Geoje Island on April 10 was not made public until May 24 has further angered the kind people of the world, who have already been enraged by the continuous atrocities committed by the aggressors.
    The commentary pointed out various facts, illustrating the bloody and terrifying atmosphere in which the aggressors' plot to forcibly detain our captured personnel was carried out, while the American imperialist murderers still cover their hideous faces with the so-called "humanitarian" mask in the armistice negotiations. They still attempt to deceive world public opinion by legalizing illegal claims such as "voluntary" and "screening"; they are still clamoring that their unreasonable plan is the so-called "unalterable final plan."
    The commentary emphasized that our unarmed captured personnel are now continuing their heroic struggle under the threat of aggressors' tanks and machine guns in order to realize their legitimate demands. Their righteous cries in the blood have aroused the anger of people all over the world. Protests to stop the aggressors from massacring our captured personnel have shaken the world. No threat or suppression by the enemy can conquer the will of our captured personnel to continue their heroic struggle; the valiant soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will never sit idly by and allow their comrades to be wantonly massacred by the aggressors. The American aggressors must bear full responsibility for all crimes of massacring our captured personnel. The aggressors will not escape the severe punishment they deserve.
    If the aggressors have the slightest sincerity in hoping for a ceasefire in Korea, they must abandon their ambition to forcibly detain our captured personnel and stop the torture and massacre of our captured personnel. Whether an agreement can be reached quickly in the armistice negotiations depends solely on the sincerity of the US side.

    朝中社警告美国侵略者
    立即停止虐杀战俘罪行 【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜中央通讯社二日以“美国侵略者必须立即停止对我方被俘人员的报复性的虐杀暴行”为题发表评论说：美国侵略者因其“自愿遣返”的阴谋被我方被俘人员的正当而英勇的斗争所彻底揭穿而惊慌失色，但侵略者却正以更残忍更阴险的手段残杀着我方被俘人员。评论说，四月十日侵略者在巨济岛杀伤我方被俘人员六十名的又一个血腥罪行，到五月二十四日才被公开，这一事实使已被侵略者连续制造的暴行所激怒的全世界善良人民，都更加愤怒。
    评论指出种种事实，说明侵略者企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋诡计是在何等血腥与恐怖的气氛中进行的，而美帝国主义杀人魔鬼在停战谈判中却仍以所谓“人道主义”的假面具掩盖它的狰狞面目；仍企图以所谓“自愿”“甄别”等非法主张的合法化，来欺骗世界舆论；仍在叫嚣它的无理方案是所谓“不可变更的最后的方案”。
    评论强调说：赤手空拳的我方被俘人员，为了实现他们的正当要求，现在正在侵略者的坦克与机关枪的威胁下继续展开英勇的斗争。他们在血泊中的正义呼声，已激起了全世界人民的怒火。制止侵略者虐杀我方被俘人员的抗议声已震动了全世界。敌人的任何威胁与镇压，绝不能征服我方被俘人员继续英勇斗争的意志；朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体勇士，也绝不会坐视他们的战友任凭侵略者恣意虐杀。美国侵略者对虐杀我方被俘人员的一切罪行，必须负全部责任。侵略者一定逃不脱应得的严重惩罚。
    侵略者如有丝毫希望朝鲜停战的诚意，那就必须放弃其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的野心，停止对我方被俘人员的拷问与虐杀。停战谈判能否迅速达成协议，只在于美方的诚意如何了。
