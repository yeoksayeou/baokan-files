Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations Disarmament Commission continues to hold meetings. On May 28th, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France submitted a joint proposal to the commission on the so-called determination of limits on the number of all armed forces. This proposal advocates determining the maximum number of armed forces for each country, but does not mention a word about disarmament or the prohibition of atomic weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction (including bacteriological weapons).
    At the commission meeting, the Soviet representative raised two questions to the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France regarding this proposal. The first question was: Do the three countries advocate adopting a decision on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and all other types of weapons of mass destruction? The second question was: Should the word "China" contained in the three countries' proposal be understood as the People's Republic of China?
    At the commission meeting on June 3rd, British representative Jebb spoke first. He vaguely and contradictorily stated that the Soviet delegation's questions were "details" for the three countries' proposal, attempting to avoid clearly answering the first question raised by the Soviet delegation. When Jebb mentioned the second question, he said that he understood the words "China" to refer to the People's Republic of China, but he immediately made a reservation, saying that the British delegation opposed inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Disarmament Commission.
    Soviet representative Malik stated: The British representative avoided directly answering the Soviet delegation's questions. In his speech, the British representative described the questions raised by the Soviet delegation as "details," but these are not details, but principled issues related to security. Determining whether China refers to the People's Republic of China or a group of politically bankrupt Kuomintang elements—whose representatives are still illegally occupying this commission—is a very important principled issue. Malik asked the commission to note that the British representative's attitude on this issue was obviously contradictory. On the one hand, the British representative admitted that, as he understood it, "China" referred to the People's Republic of China. However, on the other hand, he said that it was not necessary for the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this issue. The issue of armed forces is a matter of great international importance for every country. The issue of the number of a country's armed forces cannot be discussed without the participation of the country's legitimate representatives. Depriving the People's Republic of China of the right to participate in the discussion of the issue of the number of armed forces is completely unjustified. If the British representative believes that the commission can discuss this issue without the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, then the conclusion may be drawn that the British representative and his colleagues, although they have put forward such a proposal, do not pay much attention to it.

### 马立克在联合国裁军委员会上驳斥美英法三国联合提案  主张邀请我国参加讨论武装部队问题

    马立克在联合国裁军委员会上驳斥美英法三国联合提案
    主张邀请我国参加讨论武装部队问题
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会继续举行会议。美、英、法三国代表于五月二十八日向委员会提出关于所谓确定一切武装部队数量限额的联合提案。这项提案主张确定各国武装部队的最高数字，但是一个字也没有提到裁减军备、禁止原子武器和其他类型的大批屠杀武器
    （包括细菌武器在内）问题。苏联代表在委员会会议上，就这项提案向美、英、法三国代表提出了两个问题。第一个问题是：三国是否主张就裁减军备、禁止原子武器和一切其他类型的大批屠杀武器通过决定。第二个问题是：三国提案中所载“中国”字样，是否应了解为中华人民共和国。
    在六月三日委员会会议上，英国代表杰伯第一个发言，他含糊其词地而又自相矛盾地说苏联代表团的问题对三国提案说来是“细节”，企图避免明确回答苏联代表团所提的第一个问题。杰伯提到第二个问题时说，他了解“中国”这两个字是指中华人民共和国，可是他马上又作了一项保留，他说英国代表团反对邀请中华人民共和国派代表参加裁减军备委员会。
    苏联代表马立克发言指出：英国代表避免直截了当地答复苏联代表团的问题。英国代表在发言中把苏联代表团所提的问题说成是什么“细节”问题，但是这些并不是细节，而是有关安全问题的原则问题。确定中国究竟是指中华人民共和国还是指一群政治上破产的国民党分子——它的代表还非法地盘据在这个委员会中——这个问题是一个十分重要的原则问题。马立克要求委员会注意：英国代表在这个问题上的态度显然是自相矛盾的。一方面，英国代表承认，据他了解，“中国”是指中华人民共和国。可是，另一方面，他又说中华人民共和国没有必要参加这个问题的讨论。武装部队问题，对于每一个国家来说，都是一个具有极大国际重要性的问题。一个国家的武装部队的数量问题，没有这个国家的合法代表的参加，是一定不能加以讨论的。剥夺中华人民共和国参加讨论武装部队的数量问题的权利，是毫无理由的。如果英国代表认为，委员会可以在没有中华人民共和国代表参加的情况下讨论这个问题，那么得出这样的结论也许是因为：英国代表和他的同僚们虽然提出了这样一个提案，但却不怎么重视它。
