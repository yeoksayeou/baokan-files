Comrades of the Beijing Volunteer Surgical Team for Resisting America and Aiding Korea Who Love the Wounded

Volunteer Army Recuperating Soldiers
Fang Wenxiu, Han Zhongquan

We were wounded on the Korean front and, upon returning to the rear for recuperation, received care and love from all sectors of the people of our motherland. In our hospital, there are many comrades from the Beijing Volunteer Surgical Team for Resisting America and Aiding Korea. Their spirit of loving the motherland and the Volunteer Army deeply moved us.

In their work, they always arrive early and leave late, sometimes working all night without complaining of fatigue, sometimes so busy they forget to eat. They are constantly thinking about how to heal our wounds sooner and reduce our suffering. Sometimes, when the doctors are busy performing surgery or diagnosing, and don't have time to see the newly arrived wounded, the nurses take the initiative to change dressings and understand the condition, relaying it to the doctors. Sometimes, when the nurses are overwhelmed, the doctors also come to care for the wounded, helping with urination and defecation, and bandaging wounds. They cooperate very well, greatly reducing our suffering and accelerating the healing process.

We are all seriously wounded here. But because the doctors and nurses wholeheartedly contribute their skills, the rate of disability among the wounded is reduced. Some of our comrades originally thought they would become disabled, but were later cured. For example, one comrade had his thumb shot off and was initially worried that he would not be able to return to the front lines and kill the enemy with his gun. Later, after research by the doctors, they actually reconstructed a thumb for him: Initially, they cut a piece of skin from this comrade's abdominal wall, making a finger-shaped skin tube. Then they cut off this skin tube, sewed it onto the finger, and then took a piece of bone from the edge of the pelvic bone and transplanted it into the skin tube. This comrade then had a thumb again, restored the working ability of his hand, and can once again kill the enemy and perform meritorious service for the people of the motherland. Some comrades had bones in their hands and feet broken into sections, and the doctors reconnected the bones for them; some comrades had large wounds and the skin wouldn't grow together, so the doctors grafted skin for them; some had nerves severed, and the doctors reconnected the nerves. In this way, we have seen many miracles in treatment.

In the course of their work, they save on medical expenses and create many special exercise tools for us, calling on us to exercise at any time, so that some comrades' organs that had become stagnant due to injury soon regained their mobility.

In the ward, they not only patiently explain and comfort us, but also help us learn. Many of us are illiterate or have little literacy, and after this period of treatment and recuperation, most of us are able to read newspapers or write letters.

    热爱伤员的北京抗美援朝志愿手术队同志们
    志愿军休养员
    房文秀  韩仲全
    我们在朝鲜前线负伤，回到后方疗养的时候，受到祖国人民各方面的关心和爱护。在我们的医院里，有来自北京的抗美援朝志愿手术队的许多同志。他们热爱祖国、热爱志愿军的精神，使我们深深感动。
    他们在工作时总是早上班、晚下班，有时连夜值班也不叫累，有时忙得连饭也忘了吃。他们时时刻刻想着要早些治好我们的伤，减少我们的痛苦。有时候，大夫们在忙着动手术或诊断，一时没有功夫来看新来的伤员，护士同志们就主动地前来换药，并了解伤情，转告大夫。有时候护士们忙不过来，大夫们也来照顾伤员大小便，给伤员扎绷带。他们分工合作得很好，大大减少了我们的痛苦，加速了治愈的过程。
    我们这儿都是重伤员。但因医生、护士们全心全意地贡献了他们的技术，因而减少伤员的残废率。我们有的同志原来以为自己会变成残废的，后来却被治好了。例如有一位同志打掉了大拇指，他起初耽心自己将会不能重返前线、持枪杀敌了。后来医生们经过研究，竟给他重新做了一个大拇指：起初他们在这位同志的腹壁上割开一块皮，做成一个手指形的皮管。然后把这个皮管割下，缝到手指上，再从骨盘边缘取下一块骨头移殖到皮管内，这个同志就又有了大拇指，恢复了手的工作能力，并且又能为祖国人民杀敌立功了。有的同志手脚的骨头打断了一段，医生们就给他接骨头；有的同志伤口大，皮肤长不拢，医生们就给他补皮；有的神经断了，医生们就给接神经。这样，我们看到了许多治疗上的奇迹。
    在工作中间，他们节省药费，给我们造成了许多特殊的运动工具，叫我们随时运动，使一些同志因为受伤而呆滞了的器官，不久就恢复了活动能力。
    在病房里，他们不独耐心地给我们解释，安慰我们，而且帮助我们学习。我们中间有许多不识字或识字很少的同志，经过这段治疗和休养的时间，大部分能够看报或写信了。
