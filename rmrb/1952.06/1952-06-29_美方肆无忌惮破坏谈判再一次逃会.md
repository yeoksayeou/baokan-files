Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 28th – The US side representatives to the Korean armistice talks once again, and without reason, refused to attend the meeting on the 28th. The Panmunjom meeting tent, left empty due to the US side's absence, was silent, making the sounds of gunfire from nearby positions seem even more ominous for peace in Korea. This interruption of negotiations is the third in a month. It signifies that the US side's provocative actions aimed at sabotaging the negotiations and expanding the war are becoming increasingly reckless.

Prior to this unilateral adjournment, the US side took large-scale provocative actions outside the meeting. Ignoring our repeated protests, they continued to massacre our captured personnel. Disregarding the fact that the issue of prisoner of war handling was still under discussion, they illegally transferred 27,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang. Ignoring our firm opposition, they arbitrarily resumed "screening" of our captured personnel. They even more frantically bombed the DPRK’s Yalu River hydroelectric plants, which are non-military targets, clearly attempting to sabotage the armistice negotiations, continue to expand the war, and threaten peace in Asia and the world.

Those here recall that in the past nearly twelve months of negotiations, the US side has taken many kinds of provocative actions, attempting to blackmail the DPRK and Chinese side. However, these provocations have never affected the DPRK and Chinese side's firm stance on fairly and reasonably resolving various issues, and have never shaken their determination to make every effort to achieve a ceasefire; on the contrary, they have only revealed the US side's baseness and stupidity more and more clearly.

Deliberately sabotaging agreements and attacking neutral areas are provocative methods the US side has often used. The Kaesong area, where our delegation is stationed, is clearly protected by agreement from all attacks. However, in the past eleven months, the Kaesong neutral zone has been subjected to US air and ground attacks as many as ten times. These include the killing of Yao Qingxiang, platoon leader of our military police, by US armed personnel on August 19th last year; the assassination attempt on our delegation by US aircraft on August 22nd; the killing of two of our military police and wounding of another on August 30th; US aircraft dropping bombs near the residence of our chief representative on September 1st; the strafing incident by US aircraft on September 10th; US aircraft killing and wounding a child each in Kaesong on October 12th; bombing and strafing incidents by US aircraft on December 11th and January 17th of this year, and the incident on May 14th when US aircraft dropped more than 20 flares and made low-altitude strafing runs for as long as 55 minutes. The Panmunjom conference area is also protected from all attacks. But as recently as June 5th, the US side bombarded the conference area with dense artillery fire, injuring three little girls at the time. Afterwards, the US side had to admit responsibility for this serious incident. As for the incidents of US aircraft flying over the Panmunjom conference area, they have been endless. The freedom from attack for our delegation's supply vehicles traveling between Pyongyang and Kaesong is also a clear agreement between the two sides. However, our vehicles, which were marked with obvious signs as stipulated, have suffered five serious attacks by US aircraft. One of those on April 5th injured nine members of our delegation's staff; on May 12th, one member of our delegation's staff was killed.

The US side's record of this series of provocative actions should have made it clear to them that trying to use provocations to change the DPRK and Chinese side's position and influence their determination to persist in the struggle for a fair and reasonable ceasefire is a futile effort at all times.

### 美方肆无忌惮破坏谈判再一次逃会

    美方肆无忌惮破坏谈判再一次逃会
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜停战谈判中的美方代表二十八日又一次毫无道理地拒绝出席会议。因美方代表逃会而空下的板门店会议帐篷，寂无人声，使附近阵地上的枪炮轰鸣显得比往常更充满了对朝鲜和平的险恶预兆。这一次的谈判中断是一个月来的第三次。它标志着美方为了破坏谈判、扩大战争而采取的挑衅行为，是愈来愈肆无忌惮了。
    美方在这次片面休会之前，在会外采取了大规模的挑衅行为。他们不顾我方历次抗议，继续屠杀我方被俘人员。他们不顾战俘处理问题尚在讨论，竟非法地把我方被俘人员二万七千名移交李承晚匪帮。他们不顾我方坚决反对，擅自恢复对我方被俘人员的“甄别”。他们更疯狂地轰炸非军事目标的朝方鸭绿江水电厂，显然企图破坏停战谈判，继续扩大战争，威胁亚洲和世界的和平。
    此间人士回顾过去近十二个月的谈判中，美方曾采取过多次形形色色的挑衅行为，企图对朝中方面进行讹诈。但这些挑衅却从未影响朝中方面在公平合理解决各项问题上的坚定立场，从未动摇他们为实现停战而尽一切努力的决心；相反地，只是一次比一次更明显地暴露了美方的卑劣与愚蠢。
    有计划地破坏协议，攻击中立区是美方曾经惯用的挑衅方式。我方代表团驻地开城地区，是双方明白协议免受一切攻击的。但在过去十一个月中，开城中立区受到美方空中及地面的攻击，就达十次之多。其中包括去年八月十九日美方武装人员杀害我方军事警察姚庆祥排长；八月二十二日美机谋杀我方代表团；八月三十日杀害我方军事警察二人、打伤一人；九月一日美机在我方首席代表驻地附近投弹；九月十日美机扫射事件；十月十二日美机打死打伤开城儿童各一名；十二月十一日及今年一月十七日美机轰炸扫射事件，以及五月十四日美机投掷照明弹二十余枚、低飞扫射达五十五分钟之久的事件。板门店会场区也是免受一切攻击的。但近如六月五日，美方竟以密集排炮，轰击会场区，当时打伤小女孩三人。事后美方也不得不承认这一严重事件的责任。至于美机飞越板门店会场区的事件，更是层出不穷。我方代表团往来于平壤开城间供应车辆的免受攻击，也是双方明确协议的。但是按照规定挂有明显标志的我方车辆，共计曾遭受美机五次严重攻击。其中四月五日一次打伤我方代表团工作人员九人；五月十二日打死我方代表团工作人员一人。
    美方这一连串挑衅行为的纪录，应该已经使他们自己明白：要想用挑衅来改变朝中方面的立场，影响他们坚持为实现公平合理的停战而进行斗争的决心，在任何时候都是枉费心机的。
