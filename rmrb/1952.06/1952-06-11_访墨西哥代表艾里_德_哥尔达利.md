    Interview with Mexican Representative Eli de Gortari
    When the reporter went to interview Eli de Gortari, the chief Mexican representative attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, de Gortari was sitting alongside Rafael Mendes, another Mexican representative. They are both Mexican peace fighters. De Gortari is a professor of philosophy at the National University of Mexico and a standing committee member of the Mexican National Peace Committee. Mendes is a professor at the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico and the Women's Normal College, a member of the Mexican National Peace Committee, and the Secretary-General of the Mexico Federal District Peace Committee.
    They came from distant Mexico to attend this meeting with great enthusiasm. After getting off the plane, they took out a photograph to show to their Chinese friends. This photograph is a miniature of a large oil painting called "The Beautiful Dream of Peace and the Nightmare of War," painted by Diego Rivera, one of the Mexican initiators of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. It depicts the images of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leaders of peace-loving people of the world, and also depicts the atrocities of the American army massacring peaceful people. They wanted to present this miniature of the oil painting, which sings the praises of peace and curses war, to the Chinese people to express the Mexican people's desire for peace.
    When de Gortari spoke about the Mexican people's desire for peace, he also talked about some issues related to peace. He said: The number of unemployed people in Mexico is constantly increasing, and the income of those who are employed is also constantly decreasing due to rising prices. According to the most conservative official estimates, the cost of living in Mexico has risen by 300 percent in the last decade, while wages have only increased by a maximum of 50 percent. Forty and six-tenths percent of the people who live on wages and other income only earn one hundred pesos (Mexican currency) per month, equivalent to 11.56 US dollars, or even less. Teachers from kindergartens to universities have the lowest salaries, only slightly better than servants. Of Mexico's 25.5 million people, farmers account for 60 percent, and 32 percent of them are landless farmers, who migrate in large numbers to work as seasonal laborers at home and abroad.
    The Mexican people have risen up to defend peace in order to protect their wealth. At the beginning of this year, American imperialism attempted to use the "Mutual Security Act" to buy Mexico as its strategic base and conducted negotiations with the Mexican government on a US-Mexico bilateral defense agreement. The people of Mexico immediately held large-scale protest demonstrations, and various democratic parties also issued declarations opposing this negotiation, forcing the negotiation to finally stop. De Gortari said: "This is a manifestation of the Mexican people's strength in defending peace." However, the Mexican people's cause of defending peace is not without difficulties. During World War II, the Mexican people did not suffer direct war damage, so many of them do not fully understand how much loss a third world war would bring to the Mexican people. Therefore, peace advocates must still carry out in-depth work among the masses of the people.
    The Mexican people's strength in defending peace is continuing to develop. The Mexican National Peace Committee has state peace committees in every state in the country. In order to promote the peace movement more effectively, the Federal District Committee was established two months ago in the federal district where Mexico City, the national political, economic, and cultural center, is located. The National Committee has a total of fifty members, including professors, artists, workers, farmers, religious workers, etc., all of whom are outstanding figures from all walks of life in Mexico. Although they have various political views, various philosophical positions, and various religious beliefs, they are united under the goal of defending peace.
    De Gortari is a professor of philosophy at the National University of Mexico. All of his teaching, lectures, and writing are working for the defense of peace. He expressed his willingness to dedicate his entire life to serving this most precious aspiration of mankind. He has great hopes for this meeting. He said: "May this meeting represent the unified will of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to defend world peace. I believe that this meeting should become one of the most important events for the world peace movement, because one of the crises of the American imperialist war policy is in the Asian and Pacific regions. I hope that this meeting will help to stop the remilitarization of Japan; end the heinous crime of germ warfare; and immediately stop the American aggression in Korea. At the same time, I am also convinced that this meeting will help the people of all countries to better understand each other, better strengthen the ties of friendship, and create and develop cultural exchanges between them."

### 访墨西哥代表艾里·德·哥尔达利

    访墨西哥代表艾里·德·哥尔达利
    当记者去访问参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的墨西哥首席代表艾里·德·哥尔达利的时候，德·哥尔达利与墨西哥另一代表拉斐尔·门德斯并肩坐在一起。他们都是墨西哥的和平战士。德·哥尔达利是墨西哥大学哲学系教授、墨西哥全国和平委员会常务委员。门德斯是墨西哥国立理工学院及女子师范学院教授、墨西哥全国和平委员会委员、墨西哥联邦区和平委会员秘书长。
    他们怀着满腔的热情从遥远的墨西哥来参加这次会议，下飞机后，便拿出一张照片给中国朋友们看。这张照片是一幅很大的油画的缩影，油画的名称叫做：“和平的美梦和战争的恶梦”，是亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的墨西哥发起人之一迪越哥·立维拉画的，上面画着世界爱好和平人民的领袖斯大林大元帅和毛泽东主席的像；同时也画着美国军队屠杀和平人民的暴行。他们要把这张歌颂和平和诅咒战争的油画缩影赠给中国人民、以表示墨西哥人民爱好和平的愿望。
    德·哥尔达利在谈到墨西哥人民对于和平的愿望的时候，他同时还谈到与和平有关的一些问题。他说：墨西哥失业的人数在不断增加，有职业的人因物价上涨，收入也在不断减少，据官方最保守的估计：最近十年来，墨西哥的生活费用上涨了百分之三百，而工资最多只增加了百分之五十。靠工薪和别的收入生活的人，有百分之四十点六每月收入仅一百个比索（墨西哥货币），合十一点五六美金，或者更少一些。幼稚园以至高等学校的教师，是薪资收入最少的人，他们仅仅比仆役好一点。墨西哥两千五百五十多万人口中，农民占百分之六十，他们有百分之三十二是无土地的农民，他们大批地流亡到国内国外去作季节性的雇工。
    墨西哥人民为了保卫他们的财富，他们已经起来捍卫和平。本年初，美帝国主义曾企图利用“共同安全法”收买墨西哥作为他的战略基地，与墨西哥政府进行了美墨双边防御协定谈判。墨西哥全国人民立即举行了大规模的抗议示威游行，各民主党派又发表了反对这个谈判的宣言，迫使谈判终于停止了。德·哥尔达利说：“这就是墨西哥人民保卫和平力量的表现。”但是墨西哥人民保卫和平的事业并不是没有困难的。第二次世界大战中，墨西哥人民没有受到战争直接的破坏，因而他们其中有很多人对于第三次世界大战会给墨西哥人民带来多大损失，他们是不够了解的。因此，和平拥护者在人民群众中还必须进行深入的工作。
    墨西哥人民保卫和平的力量还在继续发展，墨西哥全国和平委员会在全国各州都设有州和平委员会。为了更有利地推进和平运动，两个月前又在全国政治、经济、文化的中心、首都墨西哥城所在地的联邦区，成立了联邦区委员会。全国委员会共有五十个委员，其中有教授、艺术家、工人、农民、宗教工作者等，他们都是墨西哥各阶层人民中杰出的人士，虽然他们之间有各种政治见解、各种哲学立场、各种宗教信仰，但他们都在保卫和平这个目标下结合起来了。
    德·哥尔达利是国立墨西哥大学哲学系教授，他的教学、讲演、写作等一切都是为着保卫和平而工作，他表示愿把自己整个的一生都为人类这种最宝贵的热望服务。对这次会议他抱着很大希望，他说：“愿这次会议能代表亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民之间的一致意志，以保卫世界和平。我认为这次会议应成为对世界和平拥护者运动具有最大重要性的事件之一，因为美帝国主义战争政策的危机之一，就是在亚洲及太平洋区域。我希望这次会议能有助于制止日本的重新军国主义化；终止细菌战的骇人罪行；并立即制止美国在朝鲜的侵略。同时我并确信这次会议将有助于各国人民之间更好的了解，能更好地加强友谊的联系，创立和发展他们之间的文化交流。”      （辛茹）
