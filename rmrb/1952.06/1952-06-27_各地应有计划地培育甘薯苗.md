    Sweet Potato Seedlings Should Be Cultivated in a Planned Way in Various Regions
    Editor: Farmers in Hebei Province plant sweet potatoes every year. However, sweet potato seedlings are a major problem that should be addressed in an organized and planned manner. Taking Shunyi County as an example, the time for planting sweet potatoes is in April and May, and there are many vendors selling sweet potato seedlings in the market. On rainy days, sweet potatoes are easier to grow, so there are more buyers, and the price of sweet potato seedlings increases twofold; if it is a windy day, sweet potatoes are not easy to grow, and the price drops. This affects the production of sweet potato seedlings. Last year, Shunyi County produced too many sweet potato seedlings, which were thrown all over the streets, but this year, the supply is insufficient, and the price is very high. How can we cultivate seedlings in an organized and planned way? I think we can cooperate in raising seedlings on a "village" basis, planting as many seedlings as needed based on the amount of land to be cultivated. Preparations for cultivating sweet potato seedlings should begin now. I suggest that various regions implement cooperative seedling cultivation under leadership. Chen Zaifu

    各地应有计划地培育甘薯苗
    编辑同志：河北省的农民每年都要种一些甘薯。但是，薯苗是个大问题，应当有组织有计划地加以解决。拿顺义县来说，四五月间是栽薯时节，市上卖薯苗的很多。在雨天，栽薯易活，买主就多，薯苗价钱便跟着上升二倍；若是风天，栽薯不易活，价钱就低落了。这就影响了薯苗的生产。顺义县去年薯苗生产过多，扔得满街都是，今年却供不应求，价钱很高。怎样有组织有计划地来育苗呢？我认为可以“村”为单位合作育苗，种多少地就育多少苗。育薯苗的准备工作目前就应该动手，我建议各地有领导地实行合作育苗。 陈在富
