To the Editor:

    For the past two years, District 11 of Beijing has adopted the method of conducting key experiments and organizing mass visits to educate the masses with facts, mobilizing them to eliminate pests and achieving great results.

    In the autumn of 1950, nearly 20,000 mu of cabbage in the district were widely affected by pests. As soon as the pests were discovered, the People's Government mobilized the masses to beat them. Some people said, "They come every year, it doesn't matter," "You can't beat them all." After a day or two, the cabbage leaves gradually turned yellow, and many people were anxious, unable to eat or sleep well. The district People's Government repeatedly mobilized and prepared a large number of special effects medicine "666 powder," but many people still said: "These are divine insects, there is no way to cure them." Later, the district People's Government sent cadres to Lu Ying to conduct key experiments and organized the surrounding masses to visit, and everyone believed that pests could be cured. In this way, all the villages affected by pests actively used "666 powder" to treat the pests. Everyone said, "Now our minds are open, and we no longer believe in any divine insects." In 1951, more than 50,000 mu of cotton in the district were mostly infested with aphids and red spiders, and many people said: "If cotton has aphids, there will be nothing to harvest." They believed that aphid infestation was a symbol of a bumper cotton harvest. The district People's Government prepared a large number of cotton aphid soap, "666 powder" and other pesticides for the farmers; the cadres repeatedly explained the harm of aphids to cotton, but some people still held the village cadres and said: "You ask me to spray pesticide, if it ruins my crops, you will compensate me." Later, Comrade Cui Zhongxin, head of the district agricultural and forestry section, personally conducted key experiments in villages such as Lucun and organized mass visits, which truly mobilized the masses and eliminated the pests. When the cotton was harvested in the autumn, many people said with a smile: "We will never be superstitious again."

    This year, at the beginning of sowing, farmers prepared a large number of pesticides. At the end of May, a small area of locust nymphs was found in Tuanhe Village. As soon as the village cadres called, thirty or forty people gathered and quickly eliminated the locust nymphs. At the beginning of June, cotton aphids were just discovered and were quickly and thoroughly eliminated. Zhao Youfu

    重点试验，组织参观是发动群众灭虫的好方法
    编辑同志：北京市十一区两年来采用重点试验，组织群众参观，用事实教育群众的方法，发动群众扑灭虫害，获得很大的成绩。
    一九五○年秋季，全区近两万亩白菜普遍发生虫害。刚发现虫害，人民政府就动员群众扑打。有些群众说：“年年有，不碍事”，“打也打不绝”。一两天之后，白菜叶子渐渐枯黄，许多人心里着急，饭也吃不下，觉也睡不安。区人民政府反复进行动员，又准备了大批的特效药“六六六粉”，但不少群众还说：“这是神虫，没有办法治。”后来区人民政府派干部在吕营进行了重点试验，组织周围群众参观，大家才相信了害虫是能治的。这样所有发生虫害的村庄，都积极用“六六六粉”治起虫来了。大家都说：“这下子脑筋开了，可不再信什么神虫了。”一九五一年全区五万多亩棉花大部生了蚜虫和红蜘蛛，许多人说：“棉花生了蚜，秋后唱台戏。”认为生蚜虫是棉花丰收的象征。区人民政府给农民准备了大批的棉蚜皂、“六六六粉”等农药；干部再三讲解蚜虫对棉花的危害，但有的群众还拉住村干部说：“你叫我打药水，打坏了你赔我呀”。后来区农林科科长崔忠信同志亲自在鹿圈等村进行重点试验，组织群众参观，才真正把群众发动起来，消灭了虫害。到秋后棉花丰收了，很多群众笑着说：“再不迷信了”。
    今年播种开始，农民们便准备好了大批农药。五月底，团河村发现了一小片蝗蝻，村干部一号召，便集合了三四十人，很快把蝗蝻扑灭了。六月初，棉花蚜虫刚刚发现，也很快就被彻底消灭了。赵有福
