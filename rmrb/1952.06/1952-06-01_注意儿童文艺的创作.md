Column: Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

    Our creation of children's literature and art is far behind today's needs. Our literary and art workers, especially those accomplished writers, musicians, playwrights, and choreographers, do not pay enough attention to this aspect of creation. It is difficult to find excellent literary works that children love in bookstores. They often complain that they cannot find poems to recite, novels or stories to tell, or dramas to perform. There are not many songs for children to sing, and even fewer children's paintings. There are many translated children's books on the market, but there are phenomena of repetition and shoddy production. The scarcity of children's books forces children to delve into adult books. The reason why martial arts and mythical novels and old comic books attract many children is also because excellent new children's literature has not captured the position.

    In this regard, the experience and achievements of the Soviet literary and art circles are worth referring to and learning from. The Soviet Writers' Association has a children's literature department, and many famous writers write for children, engaging in the creation of children's books with high artistic and ideological qualities. Many children's theaters in the Soviet Union stage dramas suitable for children of different ages, and certain films from children's film studios have also been welcomed by a large number of children in our country. Chinese children yearn for the rich literary and artistic life of Soviet children. They raise their hands to welcome the uncles and aunts who write to them, welcome writers to delve into the realm of children's lives, and establish friendships with them, using keen observation to understand the inner activities and great dreams of the Mao Zedong era's children, so that every literary and artistic work written for children becomes a powerful tool for educating them.

    Zhang Tianyi's recent excellent works for children, such as "The Story of Luo Wenyin," "Going to the Movies," and "They and Us," Feng Xuefeng's "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends," Zuo Lin's "Little Hero," Qin Zhaoyang's "Little Swallow's Flight of Thousands of Miles," the comic strip "Chicken Feather Letter," and other excellent children's books, as well as Gao Shiqi's articles on scientific knowledge, have all been warmly welcomed by children. However, the quantity is still too small to meet the demands of the vast number of children. It is hoped that writers and artists will create more excellent children's books!

### 注意儿童文艺的创作

    注意儿童文艺的创作
    我们的儿童文艺创作是远远落后于今天的需要的。我们的文学艺术工作者，特别是那些有成就的作家、音乐家、剧作家、舞蹈家们，还不够重视这方面的创作。书店里很难找到为孩子们所爱好的出色的文学作品，他们时常叫苦：找不到可以朗诵的诗篇，可以讲述的小说或故事，可以上演的戏剧。孩子们可唱的歌不很多，儿童画就更少了。市面上翻译的儿童读物很多，但是有重复和粗制滥造的现象。儿童读物的贫乏迫使儿童们往成人读物中钻。武侠神怪小说和旧小人书所以吸引住许多儿童，也是因为优秀的新儿童文学作品没有把阵地夺取过来的原故。
    在这一方面，苏联文艺界的经验和成绩是值得我们参考和学习的。苏联作家协会设有儿童文学部门，许多名作家为孩子们执笔，从事创作有高度艺术性和思想性的儿童读物。苏联许多儿童剧场上演着适宜于不同年龄儿童的戏剧，儿童电影制片厂的某些影片，在我国也得到了广大儿童的欢迎。中国的儿童向往着苏联儿童丰富的文艺生活，他们举起双手欢迎拿笔的叔叔姑姑们为他们写作，欢迎作家们深入儿童的生活领域，和他们建立友谊，以锐敏的观察力去体会毛泽东时代少年儿童的内心活动和伟大梦想，使得为儿童们写的每一件文学艺术作品，都成为教育他们的有力工具。
    张天翼最近为孩子们写的“罗文应的故事”、“去看电影”和“他们和我们”等几篇优秀作品、冯雪峰的“鲁迅和他少年时候的朋友”、左林的“小英雄”、秦兆阳的“小燕子万里飞行记”、连环图画“鸡毛信”和其他优良的儿童读物，以及高士其的一些有关科学知识方面的文章，都受到少年儿童们的热烈欢迎。但数量还是太少，不能满足广大的少年儿童们的要求。希望文艺家们创作更多的优秀儿童读物！
