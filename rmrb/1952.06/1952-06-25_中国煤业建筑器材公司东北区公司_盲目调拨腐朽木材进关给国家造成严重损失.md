China Coal Industry Building Materials Company Northeast Branch
Blindly Transfers Decayed Timber into Customs, Causing Serious Losses to the State

To the Editor: In order to meet the needs of national construction, China Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation recently transferred a large quantity of timber from the Northeast into Customs. Due to the irresponsibility of the Northeast Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, the timber was not inspected for quality and was blindly transferred. When it was transported into Customs, it was unusable, resulting in a huge waste of national transportation capacity and causing unnecessary losses to the people's property.

This year, the forest farms in the Northeast cleared out 800,000 cubic meters of accumulated timber. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council approved this batch of timber for operation by the China Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation. The company decided to keep 300,000 cubic meters for use in the Northeast, and the remaining 500,000 cubic meters (of which 30% was logs and 70% was finished timber) were transferred into Customs to supply the needs of construction in various regions. The Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation and the Northeast Branch signed a transfer contract, stipulating that the utilization rate of logs entering Customs must reach more than 50%. However, judging from the timber that has already been transported into Customs, the utilization rate of logs is far from reaching the requirements of the contract. For example, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company received 7,862.87 cubic meters of timber transferred from the Northeast Branch from April 20th to June 9th. The utilization rate of dry wood was about 40%, and most of the logs were decayed and unusable, with a utilization rate of only about 25%. The Zhangjiakou Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company transferred 1,729.99 cubic meters of timber from the Northeast Branch in May, of which 27.51% was decayed timber. Some decayed timber was transparent at both ends, and even a person could crawl into it. The utilization rate of timber transferred from the Northeast to the Tangshan Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company in May was also below 50%. A truckload of pine wood boards sent to Qinhuangdao on May 20, totaling 36.922 cubic meters, of which 15 cubic meters were decayed. Although the workers were "careful when unloading", about 2 cubic meters were still broken.

How much loss has this batch of decayed timber caused to the country after being transported into Customs? Here are just a few examples. Taking transportation costs as an example, the transportation cost from the factory site outside Customs to Shanhaiguan is about 131,580 yuan per cubic meter. From Shanhaiguan to Shijiazhuang, the transportation cost is 88,840 yuan per cubic meter. The dispatch fee is 1,707 yuan per cubic meter, the unloading fee is 4,150 yuan per cubic meter, the handling fee is 10,120 yuan per cubic meter, and the stacking fee is 9,267 yuan per cubic meter. In this way, the transportation costs lost for the existing decayed timber in the Shijiazhuang Branch alone (a part of which was left over from last year) amounted to more than 2,045,640,000 yuan. Other operating and management expenses have not yet been calculated. The transportation cost from Shanhaiguan to Zhangjiakou for the 493.326 cubic meters of decayed timber transported to the Zhangjiakou Branch alone amounted to 59,199,120 yuan. This is only the loss of transportation costs for the decayed timber that has been transported to Shijiazhuang and Zhangjiakou. If the total amount of decayed timber transferred from the Northeast into Customs is added together, the loss is even more shocking! Because this batch of timber is ineffective, it affects the timely completion of construction tasks in various regions, and the loss is even more incalculable!

The Northeast Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company, the original transfer agency, should bear the main responsibility for such a huge loss. Most of this batch of timber was felled during the period of Japanese and puppet rule and has been placed on the mountains for more than ten years. The degree of decay is very serious, and the district company is not unaware of this. At that time, as long as someone was sent to the site for a look, it could be decided which ones were fundamentally unusable, which ones should be processed on the spot, which ones should be transported, and which ones should not be transported. However, due to the serious bureaucratic and departmentalist work style of the company's leadership, they did not do so. It should be pointed out that the Northeast Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company also transferred similar decayed timber into Customs last year, and the transfer was stopped after criticism from relevant departments. This year, after the "Three-Anti" movement, they have not changed this irresponsible bureaucratic work style, which is really intolerable.

In order to avoid continued losses to national wealth, we suggest that the Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation immediately notify the Northeast Branch to stop sending decayed timber. For the timber that has already been transported into Customs, the Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation should, together with the Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department, immediately conduct inspections and propose handling opinions. The Northeast Branch of the Coal Industry Building Materials Company and all relevant shipping departments should conduct a profound self-criticism of this incident.

### 中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司  盲目调拨腐朽木材进关给国家造成严重损失

    中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司
    盲目调拨腐朽木材进关给国家造成严重损失
    编辑同志：为了适应国家建设的需要，中国煤业建筑器材总公司最近由东北调拨大批木材进关。由于中国煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司不负责任，对木材不检查质量，即行盲目调拨，运到关内而不能用，造成国家运输力的巨大浪费，使人民财产遭受不应有的损失。
    今年东北各林场清理出积存木材八十万立方米。政务院财经委员会把这批木材，批交中国煤业建筑器材公司经营。该公司决定留下三十万立方米供东北地区使用，其余五十万立方米（其中原木占百分之三十，成材占百分之七十），调运进关，供应各地建设的需要。煤业建筑器材总公司和东北区公司签订了调拨合同，规定进关的木材的原木利用率，必须达到百分之五十以上。但从已经运到关内的木材看来，原木的利用率远未达到合同的规定。例如，煤业建筑器材公司石家庄支公司，从四月二十日到六月九日，收到由东北区公司调拨来的木材七千八百六十二点八七立方米。其中干木利用率约在百分之四十左右，原木大部分腐朽不堪，利用率仅达百分之二十五左右。煤业建筑器材公司张家口支公司五月份从东北区公司调入木材一千七百二十九点九九立方米，其中腐朽木材达百分之二十七点五一。有些腐朽木材的两端可以透视，甚至能钻进一个人去。煤业建筑器材公司唐山支公司五月份从东北调进的木材，利用率也在百分之五十以下。五月二十日发到秦皇岛一车松木板，共三十六点九二二立方米，其中腐朽的达十五立方米，卸车时工人虽然“小心轻放”，还摔坏了约二立方米。
    这批腐朽的木材，运到关内，给国家造成了多大的损失呢？这里只举几个例子。以运费一项计算，由关外厂地到山海关，每立方米的运费约十三万一千五百八十元。自山海关到石家庄，每立方米运费八万八千八百四十元。调车费每立方米一千七百零七元，卸车费每立方米四千一百五十元。搬运费每立方米一万零一百二十元，上垛费每立方米九千二百六十七元。这样，仅石家庄支公司现有的腐朽木材（其中一部分是去年留下来的）损失的运费，即达二十亿四千五百六十四万余元。其他经营管理费用还没有计算在内。运到张家口支公司的四百九十三点三二六立方米的腐朽木材，仅由山海关到张家口的运费就要五千九百一十九万九千一百二十元。这仅是已经运到石家庄和张家口两地的腐朽木材的运费的损失，如果把从东北调到关内的腐朽木材的总数加在一起，损失就更触目惊心了。由于这批木材失去效用，影响各地建筑任务不能及时完成，其损失就更无法计算了！
    对于这样巨大的损失，原调拨机关煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司要负主要的责任。这批木材大部分是在日伪统治时期砍伐的，在山上已经放置了十几年。其腐朽程度十分严重，区公司不是不知道的。当时只要派人到现场去看一眼，就可以决定那些是根本不能使用的，那些是应该就地加工的，那些是该运的，那些是不该运的。但是，由于该公司领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义和本位主义的作风，他们竟没有这样作。应该指出，煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司去年也曾调拨类似的腐朽木材进关，经有关部门提出批评，才停止调运。今年，在“三反”运动以后，他们还没有改变这种不负责任的官僚主义作风，实在是令人不能容忍的。
    为了避免国家财富继续遭受损失，我们建议煤业建筑器材总公司迅速通知东北区公司立刻停发腐朽木材。对于已经运进关的木材，煤业建筑器材总公司应该会同东北贸易部驻天津办事处，立即进行检查，提出处理意见。煤业建筑器材公司东北区公司及各有关发货部门，对这一事件，应该进行深刻检讨。
