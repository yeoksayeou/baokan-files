    Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau Electric Plant Worker Zhan Xiuhua
    Improves Tools and Increases Work Efficiency
    Comrade Editor: When Zhan Xiuhua, a worker at the Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau Electric Plant, made screws, he would first put an iron sheet on a round iron rod, put it on the fire to heat, and then put the red-hot round iron rod in a wooden-frame-shaped iron groove and slowly hammer it manually. The efficiency of this operation method was very low, and the screws produced could not completely meet the specifications. Zhan Xiuhua thought, how can we improve the output and quality of products if this continues? He had been planning ways to improve the tools. He found that hammering screws in the wooden-frame-shaped iron groove was the main reason for the low efficiency. After discussing with everyone, he proposed making a hexagonal five-point screw "menzi" (闷子, "menzi" is a mold for manufacturing machine repair parts). His suggestion was adopted. When making screws with the "menzi", first put the red-hot round iron rod into the "menzi", then cover it with a model cover with a screw shape, and hammer it once with a hammer to make a screw. You don’t need to hammer it one by one with a hammer like in the past. This method improves work efficiency.

    焦作矿务局电厂工人詹秀华
    改进工具提高了工作效率
    编辑同志：焦作矿务局电厂工人詹秀华作螺丝时，都是先在圆铁棍上套一层铁片，放在火上烧，然后把烧红的圆铁棍，放在木棚形状的铁槽中，用人工慢慢地捶。这种操作法的效率很低，作出的螺丝，也不能完全合乎规格。詹秀华想，照这样下去，怎么能提高产品的产量、质量呢？他一直盘算着改进工具的办法。他发现在木棚形状的铁槽中捶螺丝，是效率不高的主要原因。他和大家商量以后，提出做一个六角形的五分螺丝闷子（闷子是制造机器修件的模子）的建议。他的建议被采纳了。用“闷子”作螺丝时，先把烧红的圆铁棍放在“闷子”里，然后盖上有螺丝形状的模型盖，用铁锤一捶，就能作好一个螺丝，不用像过去那样用铁锤一下一下地捶了。这种方法，提高了工作效率。            樵杠
