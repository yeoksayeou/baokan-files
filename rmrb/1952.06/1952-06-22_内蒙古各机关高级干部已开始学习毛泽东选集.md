The study period is six months. They will first spend one month in June studying the two major philosophical works, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," to acquire the correct ideological method.

The study time for each person is stipulated to be no less than six hours per week. Each person must make an individual study plan, fill out a brief report on their study situation each month, and write a study note or paper, or give a study report to lower-level cadres, after each study phase.

Ulanhu said that the achievements of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's construction over the past five years fully demonstrate the greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that earnestly studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and publicizing Mao Zedong Thought are important political tasks for all cadres in the Inner Mongolia region. He called for attention in this study of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to summarizing the experiences of Inner Mongolia's work in various aspects to raise them to theoretical principles and to combine this with examining the implementation of policies in the Inner Mongolia region, learning to use Mao Zedong Thought to promote the current construction work in Inner Mongolia. Ulanhu also requested high-ranking cadres participating in the study to adhere to the spirit of perseverance, consciously abide by study discipline, not only study well themselves, but also lead the study of cadres in the departments they lead.
