Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 6th: The US side's Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp authorities issued a shameless statement on the 5th, attempting to deny the atrocity of cutting off food supplies to our captured personnel. However, this statement not only failed to achieve its despicable purpose, but instead exposed the US aggressors' criminal act of openly violating the Geneva Convention to the world.

The US statement admits that "in the past three days, rations were withheld from three camp compounds: the 605th, 96th, and 85th, each not being given rations for one day." The US side claims that cutting off food supplies to our captured personnel was "an administrative measure" taken because the US military had to "take offensive action" against our captured personnel who "disobeyed orders"; yet, it also states that it "never used stopping food rations as a weapon to enforce any order." This self-contradictory statement reveals the truth: the US not only used troops to barbarically attack our unarmed captured personnel, but also resorted to starvation in an attempt to force our captured personnel to submit to the US's "orders" of persecution. All fine-sounding terms like "administrative measures" cannot conceal the heinous nature of this behavior by the US side, nor can they deny the serious crime of the US side's blatant violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War.

In fact, the US's conspiracy to use the method of cutting off food supplies to our captured personnel to achieve its despicable purpose of persecuting them has been implemented more than once. Before the US massacred our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp on May 20th in order to carry out forced "screening," the US had inhumanely cut off food supplies to 8,000 of our captured personnel for as long as nine days, starting from May 12th, in an attempt to force them to accept the US's forced "screening." Even on Koje Island, the prisoner-of-war camps where the US cut off food supplies were by no means limited to just three. An Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 5th revealed: "According to reliable sources, the rations issued to some camps have been reduced or stopped in the past few days."

In order to create an excuse for its illegal behavior, the US even claimed in its statement that our captured personnel stored "gasoline, oil, and weapons," and also stored "food." This absurdly ridiculous fabrication by the US obviously cannot conceal the fact that it is violating the Geneva Convention and mistreating prisoners of war. Under the US's cruel rule, our captured personnel, imprisoned behind multiple layers of barbed wire and unable to enjoy even the most basic humanitarian treatment, where could they get "gasoline, oil, and weapons" from, and how could they store "food"? The US's statement itself exposes these lies. The US statement admits that when it launched an armed provocation against the 96th and 85th camp compounds on June 4th, it used "flamethrowers, gasoline canisters" and caused a large fire. If people connect this fact with the so-called "gasoline, oil, and weapons" stored by our captured personnel, they can understand that the purpose of the US in fabricating these lies is to create an excuse for the US to use extremely cruel methods to massacre our captured personnel on a large scale in the future, and to create an excuse for the US to persecute our captured personnel with starvation.

The US is now using tanks, flamethrowers, machine guns, rifles, bayonets, tear gas, grenades, and even cutting off food supplies to massacre and persecute our captured personnel, while at the same time claiming that the US policy is to manage prisoner-of-war camps "in accordance with the Geneva Convention." There is nothing more shameless in the world than this!

### 美方断绝战俘食粮罪恶严重  竟发表声明妄图狡赖

    美方断绝战俘食粮罪恶严重
    竟发表声明妄图狡赖
    【新华社开城六日电】美方巨济岛战俘营当局在五日发表了一项无耻声明，企图狡赖断绝我方被俘人员食粮的暴行。可是这个声明非但没有能够达到它的卑鄙目的，却反而欲盖弥彰地向全世界招供了美国侵略者公然违反日内瓦公约的罪恶行为。
    美方的声明承认“在最近三天中，曾扣留了三个营场的口粮：第六○五号、九十六号和八十五号三个营场各有一天没有被发给口粮”。美方一方面说断绝我方被俘人员食粮，是因为美军要对“违抗命令”的我方被俘人员“采取攻势行动”而采取的“一种行政措施”；一方面却又说它“从来没有拿停发口粮作为贯彻任何命令的武器”。美方这种自相矛盾的说法，透露了事实的真相，这就是：美方不但用军队向手无寸铁的我方被俘人员野蛮地进攻，而且采取了饥饿的办法，企图迫使我方被俘人员向美方的迫害措施的“命令”屈服。一切如“行政措施”之类的好听的名词都掩盖不了美方这一行为的穷凶极恶的实质，也抵赖不了美方粗暴地破坏日内瓦战俘公约的严重罪行。
    实际上，美方用断绝我方被俘人员食粮的办法来达到其迫害他们的卑鄙目的的阴谋，实行早已不止一次。在五月二十日美方为了进行强迫“甄别”而屠杀釜山战俘营我方被俘人员以前，美方就曾从五月十二日起，伤天害理地对八千名我方被俘人员断绝伙食达九天之久，企图这样来迫使他们接受美方的强迫“甄别”。就是在巨济岛上，被美方断绝食粮的战俘营也决不止三个。美联社巨济岛五日电透露：“据可靠消息，过去几天发给若干营场的口粮已经减少或停止发给”。
    美方为了给自己这种非法行为制造藉口，竟然在声明中说我方被俘人员储藏有“汽油、油和武器”，还储藏有“食物”。美方这种荒唐已极的造谣显然不能掩饰它破坏日内瓦公约虐待战俘的事实。在美方的残酷统治之下，被囚禁在几重铁丝网里的、连起码的人道待遇都享受不到的我方被俘人员，从什么地方能够得到“汽油、油和武器”，又如何能储藏“食物”？美方的声明自己就拆穿了这些鬼话。美方声明承认，在六月四日向九十六、八十五两营场进行武装挑衅时，曾经使用了“喷火器、汽油筒”，并且已经引起了大火。人们如果把这一事实和所谓我方被俘人员储藏有“汽油、油和武器”连系起来一看，就可以知道美方制造这些谎话的目的，就是为美方将来使用极残酷的方法大规模屠杀我方被俘人员制造藉口，为美方用饥饿来迫害我方被俘人员制造藉口。
    美方现在一方面用坦克、喷火器、机关枪、步枪、刺刀、催泪弹、手榴弹以至断绝食粮来屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员，一方面却宣称美方的政策是
    “按照日内瓦公约”管理战俘营。天下再没有比这更无耻的事情了！
