    To Zhang Jihui, Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force
    I. Letter from Military Dependent Zhang Benzhou
    Jihui, my son:
    On June 4th, I was planting sweet potatoes in the mountains when your Uncle Chengzhi rushed over to tell me, "The newspaper says Jihui has become an air force hero in Korea! Aren't you happy!" At the time, I didn't feel like planting anymore! I thought: Can you really do it? A simple kid who followed his father carrying loads for landlords when he was young, can actually fly into the sky and become an air force hero! That evening, I went back to ask your Uncle Chengzhi, and he read the newspaper to me. It even had your picture on it! I was so happy! Jihui, you have become a people's hero, and your parents share in the glory. I think, Jihui, this glory should be attributed to Chairman Mao's education and the support of the people of the whole country.
    You have been away from home for more than seven years. In those seven years, our family has changed a lot. Now we have fifteen acres of good land. Your father responded to Chairman Mao's call and cultivated the land carefully, selecting and changing varieties, which resulted in a bumper harvest. He was selected as a production model for the district and village. This year, the higher authorities called on us to dig wells to prevent drought, so your brother and I dug four wells and bought a waterwheel. We also helped Zhang Litian, a martyr's family in our village who lacked labor, to dig a well. As a result, the village selected us as a well-digging model. We irrigated our eight acres of wheat four times this year. It looks like each acre will yield an average of 390 catties. The district has also selected us as a high-yield wheat household.
    Your brother and sister-in-law are working in Wuhan, your brother is a member of the Communist Youth League, and you have become a hero. I am also a production model. People in our village call us a glorious family, and I am very happy.
    Jihui, if it weren't for Chairman Mao, where would our family be today? You must not be complacent, and you must continue to work hard. Be a people's hero for life, not just a hero for a moment. I will also work harder in the future. The higher authorities told me that wheat should be selected in the field, and I guarantee to select all of it this year and promote others to select as well. Wheat should be harvested in time, dried early, and actively turned over as public grain to support the country's economic construction and support you in winning more victories.
    Jihui, you are killing enemies with planes in Korea, and I am supporting you at home with a hoe. Let's work harder!
                                                Father Benzhou (dictated)
                                             (Written by Zhou Jianshao)
                               June 16th
    II. Letter from All the People of Qiaoshang Village, Rongcheng, Shandong
    Dear Comrade Jihui:
    We saw your heroic deeds in the newspaper, as well as your picture and the picture of your plane. We are extremely happy. Everyone is scrambling to see it, and those who can't read are forcing those who can to read it to them. In this way, your name has been spread. The people of our village all feel that it is an unparalleled honor, because you are eliminating great harm for the Chinese and Korean people, avenging the dead, and bringing hope to peace-loving people all over the world. You have become a heroic warrior defending peace!
    You said, "Without the Party and the people, I would not be where I am today." That's right! Our hometown has also completely changed under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. Landlords and bullies have been overthrown, the people have elected their own representatives to handle affairs for us, and the children of the poor can also go to school. It is truly a new atmosphere! This year, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy to continue supporting the Volunteer Army, we have all organized ourselves. We have made a lot of achievements in patriotic production, drought resistance, water conservancy, and sanitation campaigns. In particular, your father has become the most supported and loved person in our village. He has been selected by us as a labor model in the district, a model military dependent, a village security model, a seed selection model, and a well-digging model. He is also the leader of a production mutual aid team and has recently been named a high-yield wheat household in the whole township. He is doing these jobs with more enthusiasm than young people. Everyone says: The Zhang Jihui family is truly a "glorious family"! The son is a hero, the father is a model, who doesn't praise them, who doesn't like them!
    Well then, you bravely kill the enemy on the battlefield, and we work hard to produce at home. Let's all work together to defeat the American imperialist aggression as soon as possible to defend our peaceful and happy lives. In addition, the people of our hometown hope that after the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, you will have the opportunity to fly your lovely "silver swallow" over our hometown for everyone to see!
    On the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against American aggression, we wish you more victories in the near future!
    All the people of Qiaoshang Village, Shoujin Township, 12th District, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province

### 给志愿军空军英雄张积慧

    给志愿军空军英雄张积慧
    一、军属张本周的信积慧儿：
    六月四日那天，我正在山里栽地瓜，你澄芝大叔匆匆跑来告诉我：“报纸上登着，积慧在朝鲜当了空军英雄啦。你可喜欢吧！”当时我没心思再栽啦！心想：你能吗？小时候跟着爹给地主扛小活的老实孩子，也能飞上天当空军英雄！晚上回家又去问你澄芝叔，他把报纸念给我听，上面还登着你的照片，我可乐啦！积慧，你成了人民的英雄，爹妈也跟着光荣。我想，积慧，这个光荣应归功于毛主席的教育和全国人民的支援。
    你离开家已经七年多了，七年多中间，咱家也大不同前了。现在咱共有十五亩好地，你爹响应了毛主席的号召，精耕细作，选种换种，得到了丰收，被选为区、村的生产模范。今年，上级号召我们打井，防止旱灾，我就和你弟弟一股脑儿打了四眼井，还买了一部水车，又帮助咱村缺乏劳力的烈属张立田打了一眼井。这样，村里又选咱为打井模范。咱种的八亩小麦，今年浇了四遍，现在看来，每亩平均能收三百九十斤，区上又评选咱是小麦丰产户。
    你哥你嫂在武汉工作，你弟弟是个青年团员，你又当了英雄，我也是个生产模范，咱村人都称咱是光荣人家，我越想越欢喜。
    积慧呀，要不是毛主席，咱家那有今天？你千万不要自满，还要继续使劲干。要为人民英雄一世，不要英雄一时。我今后也要更加劲干。上级告诉我，小麦要田间选种，我今年保证全部选，还要推动别人选。小麦要及时收割，早些晒干，积极交公粮，支援国家的经济建设，支援你们打更多的胜仗。
    积慧，你在朝鲜用飞机杀敌，我在国内用锄头来支援你。咱们加劲干吧！
                                                父本周口述
                                             （周建韶代笔）
                               六月十六日
    二、山东荣成桥上村全村人民的信
    亲爱的积慧同志：
    我们从报纸上看到了你的英雄事迹，还有你和你的飞机的照片，我们高兴极了。大家都争着看，不识字的人逼着识字的人念给他听。就这样，你的名字被传开了。咱村人民都感觉是无尚的光荣，因为你给咱中朝人民除大害，给死难者报仇，给全世界爱好和平的人民带来了希望。你已经成了保卫和平的英雄战士！
    你说：“如果没有党和人民，我是不会有今天的。”真对！咱家乡在毛主席和共产党的领导下，也完全变了样。地主恶霸已被打倒，人民自己选出了代表给咱办事，穷人的子弟也能上学，真是一片新气象！今年，为了响应毛主席关于增产节约，继续支持志愿军的号召，我们都组织起来了。在爱国增产、抗旱防旱、开展水利和卫生运动等方面，都有了不少成绩。特别是你的父亲，已成了咱村人民最拥护最爱戴的人。他被我们选为区上的劳动模范、军属模范，村里的治安模范、选种模范、打井模范、他又是生产互助组组长，最近还被评为全乡的小麦丰产户。他担任着这些工作，比青年人干的还欢。大家都说：积慧家真是个“光荣人家”！儿是英雄，父当模范，谁不称赞，谁不喜欢！
    好吧，你在战场上英勇杀敌，我们在国内努力生产，咱们大家拧在一起，早日打败美帝国主义的侵略，来保卫我们和平幸福的生活。另外，家乡人们都希望你能在抗美援朝战争胜利结束后，有机会驾驶着你那可爱的“银燕”，飞到咱家乡的上空，给大家看看哩！
    在这朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年的时候，谨祝你在不久的将来，给我们送来更多的胜利消息！
    山东省荣成县十二区守津乡桥上村全体人民
