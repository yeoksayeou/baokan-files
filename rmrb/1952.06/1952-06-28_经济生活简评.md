Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Promote the Experience of Short-Distance Material Exchange
    Danyang County in Southern Jiangsu Province utilized the temple fairs and market gatherings familiar to the masses to hold a county-wide exchange conference for urban and rural products. Within three days, 30,000 people participated in the transactions and visits, with a turnover of over 2 billion yuan. This form of short-distance urban and rural product exchange should be promoted in various regions.
    At the Danyang County product exchange conference, producers and consumers met directly, established close connections, exchanged industrial and agricultural products, and opened up sales channels for minor local products. This promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production and revitalized the urban and rural economy.
    This small-scale product exchange conference is simple and easy to implement, without requiring a large amount of manpower and resources. Because it is combined with the habits of the masses, it has great universality. A special district, a county, or even a district can hold it.
    Some cadres of state-owned enterprises are not concerned enough about the Danyang County product exchange conference. They believe that they are doing big business, and thus look down on this small conference, which is obviously wrong. In order to carry out urban and rural product exchange on a large scale and universally, cadres of state-owned enterprises should actively participate and help local people's governments organize such product exchange conferences. Promote Thrift and Savings, Storing Grain to Prevent Famine
    Thrift and savings, storing grain to prevent famine are good habits of our people. Various regions should promote and lead them in future disaster prevention and relief work.
    One of the effective ways to save, store, and accumulate grain to prevent famine is to establish community granaries (Yi Cang). Community granaries are old mass famine prevention organizations. In the past two or three years, many regions across the country have reorganized old community granaries or established new ones. These community granaries have played a significant role in supporting disaster victims through times of famine. In three years, community granaries in Songjiang Province accumulated a total of 30 million jin of grain. Last year, although the province suffered from floods, disaster victims did not need the government to allocate grain for relief. Heilongjiang Province also relied on community granary grain to solve the difficulties of farmers during the lean season. Many regions have created experience in running community granaries in vast rural areas, and various regions should summarize these experiences and gradually promote them. Regions that have not yet established community granaries should strive to conduct pilot programs with a focus after this summer and autumn.
    In addition to community granaries, there are many other ways for the people to store grain and prevent famine. Various regions can promote grain storage methods that are customary and supported by the masses based on specific circumstances.
    When leading farmers to store grain for famine prevention, regardless of the organizational form adopted, the following points should be noted:
    1. Mobilize the masses to do it themselves and manage it themselves; the government can only provide assistance and cannot take over everything. A certain organizational and democratic management system must be established to truly make it an organization for mutual assistance and famine prevention for the people themselves.
    2. The source of grain should be raised on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. Absolutely no apportionment method should be adopted to avoid creating a burden on the masses. The amount of fundraising should not be too large either. The best time to fundraise is after the harvest of the main produce each year.
    3. Community granary grain should be used rationally under the principle of "storing grain in good years and using it in famine years," and should never be misused. Attention should also be paid to grain storage to prevent insect infestation and mold.

    经济生活简评
    推广短距离物产交流的经验
    苏南丹阳县利用群众所熟悉的庙会集场，举行了
    一个县范围内的城乡物产交流大会。三天以内，有三万人参加交易和前往参观，成交额达二十亿余元。这种短距离的城乡物产交流的形式，各地应该加以推广。
    在丹阳县的物产交流大会上，生产者和消费者直接见了面，建立了密切的联系，交换了工业品和农产品，开辟了小宗土产品的销路。这就推动了工业和农业生产的发展，使城乡经济活跃起来。
    这种小规模的物产交流大会，简便易行，不必动用许多人力和物力。由于它和群众的习惯相结合，所以具有极大的普遍性。一个专区、一个县，甚至一个区，都是可以举行的。
    有些国营企业的干部，对丹阳县的物产交流大会不够关心，他们认为自己是作大生意的，因而看不起这种小会，这显然是错误的。为了大规模地、普遍地开展城乡物产交流，国营企业的干部应该积极参加并帮助各地人民政府组织这样的物产交流大会。提倡节约储蓄积谷防荒
    节约储蓄、积谷防荒，这是我国民间的良好习惯。各地在今后的防灾、救灾工作中，应该加以提倡和领导。
    节约储蓄、积谷防荒的有效办法之一，就是建立义仓。义仓是旧有的群众性的防荒组织。两、三年来，全国不少地区，已经整理了旧的义仓或建立了新的义仓。这些义仓对于支持灾民度荒，都有很大的作用。松江省义仓三年间共积粮三千万斤，去年该省虽有水灾，但灾民不需政府拨粮救济；黑龙江省靠义仓粮也解决了农民在青黄不接时候的困难。许多地区已经创造了在广大乡村举办义仓的经验，各地应该总结这些经验，逐步加以推广。凡未举办义仓的地区，应争取在今年夏秋以后有重点地试办。
    除了义仓以外，民间积谷防荒的办法还很多，各地可以依据具体情况，推行为群众所习惯和拥护的储粮备荒的办法。
    各地领导农民储粮备荒，不论采取何种组织形式，都应注意以下几点：
    一、发动群众自己来办，自己来管；政府只可给予帮助，不能包办代替。必须建立一定的组织和民主管理制度，使它真正成为人民自己的互济防荒的组织。
    二、粮食来源，要在群众自愿的原则下进行募集，决不可采取摊派办法，以免形成群众的负担。募集数量亦不宜过多。募集时间最好在每年主要产物收获以后。
    三、应在“丰年储粮，荒年使用”的原则下合理地使用义仓粮，绝对不可滥用。并要注意粮食保管，防止发生虫蚀、霉烂现象。
