    Jinsheng Textile Factory Weaving Workshop Workers Learn the 1951 Weaving Method

    To the Editor: The workers of the weaving workshop of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory began to learn the 1951 weaving method in March. When learning, the workers were in high spirits, discussing it while walking and eating. After the learning was completed, the entire weaving workshop took on a new look, and excellent results continued to appear. The Wang Liang group used to be disunited. In February, each person averaged only 30.98 yards of cloth per day, and often produced substandard cloth. Now this group has changed. Everyone is united tightly, actively offering opinions and correcting mistakes. In April, each person averaged 32.74 yards of cloth per day, and also eliminated substandard cloth. Female worker Gao Shuqin used to weave a maximum of 31 yards per day, and every time she wove, there would be a hole of one or two chi. She felt very distressed and thought that her skills were not high enough and there was no way to improve. Since learning the 1951 weaving method, her work has become more enjoyable. In April, her daily output reached 33.8 yards, and there were no more holes. She was rewarded for this. She said, "Originally, the machine controlled the person, but now the person controls the machine." Generally speaking, the workers in the weaving workshop used to sweat profusely when weaving, and were clueless; now they feel that the work is easy and regular. Old worker Xu Tongbao said, "I've been running around in circles for decades, and I've finally finished!"

    晋生纺织厂织布间工人
    学会一九五一织布工作法
    编辑同志：太原晋生纺织厂织布间工人，在三月份开始学习一九五一织布工作法。学习时，工人们情绪很高，走路吃饭都谈论这件事。学习完毕，全织布间气象一新，优异成绩不断出现。王良小组过去不团结，二月份每人每天平均只织布三十码点九八，还常出次布。现在这个小组变了样子，大家团结得紧紧的，积极提出意见，纠正错误，四月份每人每天平均织布三十二码点七四，还消灭了次布。女工高淑琴过去每天最多织三十一码，一织就有一、二尺的窟窿。她感到很苦恼，认为自己技术不高，没有办法。自学习了一九五一织布工作法，她的工作愉快起来了。四月份，她的日产量达到三十三码点八，窟窿也没有了。她因此得了奖励。她说：“本来老是机器掌握人，现在可是人掌握机器了。”一般说来，织布车间工人过去织布时总是累得满头大汗，而且茫无头绪；现在却感觉工作轻松，又有规律。老工人许同保说：“我跑了几十年的冤枉路，总算跑完啦！”    　刘振文
