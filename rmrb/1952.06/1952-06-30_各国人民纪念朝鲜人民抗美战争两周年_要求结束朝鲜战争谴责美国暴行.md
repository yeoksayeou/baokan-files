People of Various Countries Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the Korean People's War Against America
    Demanding an End to the Korean War and Condemning American Atrocities
    U.S. Communist Party Calls for Striving to Immediately Stop the War of Aggression Against Korea
    The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States recently issued a statement calling on the American people to rise up and strive for the immediate conclusion of a Korean armistice agreement to prevent Washington politicians and warlords from sabotaging the Korean armistice talks and expanding the war in Asia.
    The statement said: The so-called "voluntary repatriation" trick of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war now being played by Truman, Ridgway, and Clark is an excuse for them to sabotage the armistice negotiations. Continuing to play these conspiracies, continuing to forcibly screen Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, mass slaughtering prisoners of war on Geoje Island, and destroying the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War: all of this is a disgrace to Americans.
    The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States believes that the atrocities of the U.S. interventionist army, especially the provocative bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Station, "prove that Washington's politicians and generals intend to break off the armistice negotiations and attempt to expand the war in Asia." It called on the American people to stop the nonsense about so-called "voluntary repatriation," demanded participation in and ratification of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of Bacteriological Warfare, prevented the Washington government from ratifying the military treaty concluded with German Nazi generals and financial oligarchs, and demanded negotiations for an immediate ceasefire in Korea.
    General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party Condemns the American Aggressors
    Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, issued the following statement on June 25: "On June 25, 1950, the American imperialists, in order to realize their conspiracy to launch a new world war, attacked the Korean people with the help of the puppet Syngman Rhee.
    Over the past two years, the Korean people and their allies – the Chinese People's Volunteers – have written an epic of heroism. Their resolute struggle has shattered the conspiracies of the American warmongers and saved the world from destruction.
    After the failure of the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their accomplices, they adopted unprecedented evil methods in world history.
    They violated all laws and all international conventions, spread death among unarmed civilians, destroyed cities and villages, spread deadly bacteria, and inhumanly massacred prisoners of war.
    Due to the collapse of their military conspiracy and the pressure of world opinion, they had to start armistice negotiations, but they are now desperately trying to sabotage these negotiations. They demand the right to detain more than 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, their excuse being that these prisoners of war do not want to go home. The horrific massacre in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp has exposed the absurdity of this excuse. The cause for which the Korean and Chinese people are fighting, the cause of liberating the Asian people, the cause of freedom and peace, is our own cause."
    Ghosh urged all democratic parties, trade unions and other organizations to hold rallies and demonstrations across the country to express their support for the Korean people, condemn the crimes of the American interventionists, and demand that the Indian government support the just position of the Korean People's Government on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war.
    American Women Demand Peace in Korea
    A delegation from the American Women for Peace Committee visited the Soviet representative to the United Nations and delivered a letter. The letter stated that on the second anniversary of the Korean War, the delegation submitted a statement to Austin, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, stating: Our actions in Korea are morally indefensible. Our country has a moral responsibility to fulfill the provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war and the treatment of prisoners of war. Our country, which has not yet signed the 1925 Geneva Protocol declaring bacteriological warfare illegal, cannot justify ourselves by merely denying allegations of the use of bacteriological warfare. If we want to prove that we are indeed a peace-loving country, as we claim, and that we are indeed seeking peace in Korea and the world, then we must immediately and unconditionally agree to exchange prisoners of war and immediately ratify the protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological warfare.
    The statement pointed out that two years of the Korean War have brought to the United States: massive casualties, broken families, demoralization, increased unemployment, inflation, a sharp decline in living standards, increasing housing shortages, increasing prejudice and violence against blacks and all minorities, denial of civil rights, and a nationwide atmosphere of fear. Two years of war have brought destruction and death to Korea.
    The statement said: The world is increasingly disgusted with the United States and the role it is playing. Therefore, the responsibility lies with us, the American people. We women have decided not to have a third year of war.
    We demand that the government implement our decision. We demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and the convening of a five-power conference to hold negotiations to resolve all outstanding differences, so as to ensure that a third world war never occurs.
    We welcome the position taken by the Soviet Union for the security and peace of Korea, and its unremitting efforts to achieve lasting world peace. We American women promise that we will continue to fight for peace, no matter how difficult the struggle may be.
    British Women Protest American Delay of Armistice Negotiations
    To commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against America, the British National Women's Congress organized a demonstration in London on June 25 to protest the intervention of the U.S. and British aggressor troops in Korea and to protest the U.S.'s deliberate delay of the armistice negotiations.
    The wives, mothers, and relatives of British prisoners of war and soldiers in Korea came to London from all over the country on this day and marched to the Houses of Parliament to present their demands to the members of parliament. They held up various signs demanding an end to the war and the return of their husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers. Many of the demonstrating women were carrying children, and as they marched through the streets of London, the residents along the way cheered and greeted them.
    A group of women met with Queen Elizabeth and presented her with a letter asking her to help end the Korean War and bring the prisoners of war and soldiers home. Another group of women went to the British Broadcasting Corporation Authority and the editorial offices of several newspapers, asking them to widely publicize their movement. The women also wrote to British Prime Minister Churchill, saying: "We are now telling you that if our people cannot come home, we will never give up."
    In the evening, the women held a gathering at Conway Hall, and the conference enthusiastically resolved to send a telegram to the Korean women to express their sympathy and the determination of British women to end the war.
    The meeting unanimously passed a resolution condemning the U.S. imperialist bombing of the Yalu River power plant, which said: "We, the relatives, friends, and sympathizers of those captured in Korea, condemn the recent bombing of the Yalu River power plant at this meeting. At a time when the armistice negotiations have entered such a critical stage, we are chilled to the bone that the U.S. High Command, in the name of the United Nations, has committed such an act. This action endangers the lives of all our relatives in Korea and brings the Third World War closer. This strengthens our determination to end the war and bring our loved ones home."

    各国人民纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年
    要求结束朝鲜战争谴责美国暴行
    美共号召争取立即制止侵朝战争
    美国共产党全国委员会顷发表声明，号召美国人民奋起，争取立即缔结朝鲜停战协定，以阻止华盛顿的政客和军阀破坏朝鲜停战谈判和在亚洲扩大战争。
    声明说：杜鲁门、李奇微和克拉克现在玩弄的所谓朝鲜和中国战俘应“自愿遣返”的诡计，是他们破坏停战谈判的藉口。继续玩弄这些阴谋诡计，继续强迫甄别朝中战俘，大批残杀在巨济岛上的战俘，破坏关于对待战俘的日内瓦公约：所有这一切都是美国人的耻辱。
    美国共产党全国委员会认为：美国干涉军的暴行，特别是对鸭绿江水电站进行的挑衅轰炸，“证明华盛顿的政客和将领打算使停战谈判破裂并企图在亚洲扩大战争”。它号召美国人民制止关于所谓“自愿遣返”的鬼话，要求参加并批准一九二五年关于禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书，制止华盛顿政府批准与德国纳粹将领和金融寡头缔结的军事条约，要求举行在朝鲜立即停火的谈判。
    印共总书记斥责美国侵略者
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士于六月二十五日发表下列声明：“一九五○年六月二十五日，美帝国主义者为了实现他们发动新世界大战的阴谋，在傀儡李承晚的帮助之下向朝鲜人民进攻。
    过去两年来，朝鲜人民及其盟友——中国人民志愿军——写出了英雄的史诗，他们的坚决斗争已经粉碎了美国战争贩子们的阴谋，并把世界从毁灭里拯救了出来。
    美帝国主义者及其帮凶们的阴谋失败以后，他们就采取了世界历史上空前的罪恶手段。
    他们违犯了一切法律和一切国际公约，在手无寸铁的老百姓中间散布死亡，毁灭城市与农村，散布致命的细菌，并且毫无人性地屠杀战俘。
    由于他们军事阴谋的崩溃，也由于全世界舆论的压力，他们不得不开始停战谈判，但是他们现在正在拚命破坏这种谈判。他们要求有权扣留十万以上的朝鲜与中国战俘，他们的藉口是这些战俘不愿意回家。巨济岛战俘营里的恐怖屠杀，已经暴露了这种藉口的荒谬。朝鲜与中国人民正在以战斗争取的事业，解放亚洲人民的事业，自由与和平的事业，也就是我们自己的事业。”
    高士敦促所有的民主党派、工会与其他团体在全国举行集会与示威，表示他们对于朝鲜人民的支持，斥责美国干涉者的罪行，要求印度政府在遣返战俘问题上支持朝鲜人民政府的正义立场。
    美国妇女要求实现朝鲜和平
    美国妇女和平委员会代表团访问苏联驻联合国代表，并递交信件一封。信中说，该代表团在朝鲜战争两周年之际，向美国驻联合国常任代表奥斯汀提出了一项声明，声明说：我们在朝鲜的行动在道义上是无法辩护的。我国对履行日内瓦公约关于遣返战俘和待遇战俘的条款负有道义上的责任。还没有在宣布细菌战为非法的一九二五年日内瓦议定书上签字的我国，不能单凭着否认对使用细菌战的指责来替我们自己辩护。倘若我们要证明我们确实如我们所声明的是一个爱好和平的国家，确实在觅取朝鲜和全世界的和平，那么，我们就得立即无条件地同意交换战俘，立即批准关于禁止细菌战的议定书。
    声明指出，两年的朝鲜战争带给美国的是：大量的死伤，破碎的家庭，士气颓败，失业增加，通货膨胀，生活标准猛烈降低，房屋日益缺乏，对黑人及一切少数民族偏见日深以至使用暴力，否认公民权利，恐惧笼罩全国。两年的战争带给朝鲜的则是毁灭和死亡。
    声明说：全世界对美国及其扮演的脚色日益发生反感。所以责任就落在我们美国人民的身上。我们妇女们决定不让再有第三年的战争。
    我们要求政府实行我们的决定。我们要求在朝鲜立即停火并召集五大国会议，举行谈判，以解决一切悬而未决的歧见，务使永远不会发生第三次世界大战。
    我们欢迎苏联为朝鲜的安全与和平的利益所采取的立场，以及它为达成世界持久和平所作的不懈努力。我们美国妇女们保证我们将继续为和平而斗争，不管这场斗争有多么困难。
    英国妇女抗议美国拖延停战
        谈判
    英国全国妇女大会为纪念朝鲜抗美卫国战争两周年，于六月二十五日在伦敦组织了示威游行，抗议美英侵略军干涉朝鲜，抗议美国蓄意拖延停战谈判。
    在朝鲜的英国战俘及士兵的妻子、母亲和亲属在这一天从全国各地来到伦敦，列队走到议会大厦，向议员们提出她们的要求。她们举着种种标语牌，要求停止战争，让她们的丈夫、儿子、兄弟和父亲回家。示威的妇女有很多人带着小孩，她们在伦敦的大街上列队走过时，道旁的居民都向她们欢呼致意。
        一部分妇女谒见了伊丽莎白女王，向她递交一封信，要求她协助终止朝鲜战争，让战俘和士兵回家。另外一批妇女前往英国广播公司管理局及若干报纸的编辑部，要求它们广泛地为她们的运动宣传。妇女们还给英国首相邱吉尔写信说：“我们现在告诉你，如果我们的人不能回家来，我们决不罢休。”
    晚上，妇女们在康威大厅举行集会，大会热烈地决议致电朝鲜妇女，向她们表示同情和英国妇女要求终止战争的决心。
    会议一致通过谴责美帝国主义滥炸鸭绿江发电厂的决议，其中说：“我们这些在朝鲜被俘人员的亲属、友人和同情者的这次会议，谴责最近对鸭绿江发电厂的轰炸。正当停战谈判进入如此严重阶段的时候，美国最高司令部以联合国的名义，竟干出这种行为，我们感到不寒而栗。这种行动危及我们在朝鲜的全部亲人的生命，使第三次世界大战更加迫近。这加强了我们终止战争使我们的亲人回家的决心。”
