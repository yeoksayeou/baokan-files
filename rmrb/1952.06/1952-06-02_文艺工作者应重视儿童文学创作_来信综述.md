Literary and Art Workers Should Emphasize Children's Literature Creation
—Letter Summary
Readers Wang Huiying, Da Yinglu, Mai Guang, and others sent letters to this newspaper, offering opinions on the creation of children's literature and art. Their opinions are summarized and published below:

Wang Huiying from the No. 1 Central Elementary School in the Sixth District of Beijing wrote: The current creation of children's literature is quite lacking. Take comic strips, for example. Children love to read them, but there are very few comic strips created specifically for children. Most are reading materials for adults. In order to better educate the new generation, we suggest that relevant departments pay attention to this work, organize literary and art workers and education workers to conduct guided and planned research on topics suitable for children's requirements, and create works that are educationally meaningful for children.

Da Yinglu from the Affiliated Middle School of Nanjing University wrote in his letter: We cannot say that our literary publications are few in number, but there are very few works related to children's literature. Our newspapers and magazines also do not use a certain amount of space to publish children's literature works. The "Little Friend," "New Young Pioneer," and other publications that we publish specifically for children to read, the children's literature works published in them, are not satisfactory in terms of quality and quantity.

Mai Guang from the Office of the Changsha Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote: At present, excellent children's literature works, especially in the area of children's movies, are far behind the needs of children. Our literary and art workers have created such good films as "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," and "Boundless Light," but it is rare to see someone create a relatively excellent children's movie script. Movies suitable for adults are not necessarily loved by children, and are even less likely to have the educational effect they should have among children. Therefore, excellent children's movies are what children need.

### 文艺工作者应重视儿童文学创作——来信综述

    文艺工作者应重视儿童文学创作
    ——来信综述
    读者王慧英、达英騄、麦光等给本报来信，对儿童文学艺术的创作提出意见，现在把他们的意见摘要发表如下：
    北京市六区第一中心小学校王慧英来信说：现在的儿童文学创作是相当贫乏的。以连环画来说吧，儿童们都非常爱看，可是，很少有专为儿童创作的连环画，大多是成人的读物。为了更好地教育新的一代，我们建议有关部门重视这个工作，组织文艺工作者及教育工作者有领导有计划地研究适合儿童要求的题材，创作对儿童有教育意义的作品。
    南京大学附属中学达英騄的信中说：我们的文学刊物不能说是不多，但是有关儿童文学的作品却很少。我们的报刊、杂志也没有用一定的篇幅登载儿童文学作品。我们所出版的专门给少年儿童们阅读的“小朋友”“新少年报”等刊物，所登载的儿童文学作品，质与量两方面都是不能使人满意的。
    中共长沙地委办公室麦光来信说：目前优秀的儿童文学作品，尤其是儿童电影这一方面，远赶不上儿童的需要。我们的文艺工作者创作了像“白毛女”“钢铁战士”“光芒万丈”这样好的影片，但是很少见到有人创作一部比较优秀的儿童电影剧本。适合于成年人看的电影，不一定为儿童们所爱看，更不一定能在儿童当中收到应有的教育作用。所以优秀的儿童电影是儿童们所需要的。
