To the Editor:

The People's Daily published a reader's letter in the reader's letters column on May 22, suggesting that the Bank of Communications should promptly resolve the issue of production leadership at the Pushan Printing Factory. The reader's criticism is correct and greatly helps our work. After reading the criticism, we immediately convened relevant personnel for a self-criticism. The main reason for the delay in handling this matter was our failure to promptly report the factory's difficulties to the relevant departments. We will definitely overcome this irresponsible attitude in the future. We have now submitted this issue to the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and proposed a solution. This problem will be resolved soon. At the same time, we are checking and resolving similar issues.

    检讨忽视普善印刷厂生产领导问题的错误
    编辑同志：五月二十二日人民日报读者来信栏登载读者来信，建议交通银行迅速解决普善印刷厂的生产领导问题。读者的批评是正确的，对我们的工作有很大的帮助。我们看到批评以后，立即召集有关人员进行检讨。这件事迟迟没有处理的主要原因，是我们没有及时向有关部门反映这个厂的困难情况。我们今后一定克服这种不积极负责的工作态度。现在，我们已经把这个问题呈报北京市财政经济委员会，并提出处理意见。这个问题不久即可解决。我们同时正检查和解决与这件事情类似的问题。　交通银行总管理处营业部
