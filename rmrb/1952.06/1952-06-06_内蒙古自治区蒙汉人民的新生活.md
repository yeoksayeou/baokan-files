    The New Life of Mongolian and Han People in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

    Editor: The new atmosphere of unity, friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between the Mongolian and Han people in the Nurtuk No. 6 Gacha (village) of the Butha Banner Qiqihar Township in the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a vivid example of the new life of the Mongolian and Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    The No. 6 Gacha has more than 110 households, including both Mongolian and Han people. In the past, they suffered the same oppression and exploitation from Japanese imperialism and feudal landlords, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, the Mongolian and Han people were liberated together. The Mongolian and Han people united and launched a large-scale production movement. According to preliminary statistics in the winter of 1951, the cultivated land area of the entire Gacha increased by more than 25% compared to the time of the land reform, the number of large and small livestock increased by 30%, and the number of vehicles increased by 45%.

    The new relationship between the Mongolian and Han people in No. 6 Gacha is particularly evident in production cooperation. In the past, some Han people always ridiculed the Mongolian people for not knowing how to farm; the Mongolian people were unwilling to learn from the Han people. In recent years, the Mongolian and Han people have united and helped each other to actively produce; many Mongolian people have not only learned to farm, but also learned intensive farming, fertilizer accumulation and application. On the other hand, the Han people have also learned good methods of raising and managing livestock from the Mongolian people. The Mongolian and Han people have also organized mutual aid groups on the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. With the improvement of agricultural and animal husbandry production, the cultural and educational undertakings of No. 6 Gacha have also developed day by day. Before liberation, there were only more than 20 Mongolian and Han students in the Gacha. Now, there are more than 60 students. This is a scene that people could not have imagined before liberation.

    From their own experience, the people of Inner Mongolia deeply know that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and in close unity with the people of all ethnic groups, can they create today's prosperous days. Aohai

    内蒙古自治区蒙汉人民的新生活
    编辑同志：内蒙古自治区呼纳盟布特哈旗齐齐哈尔乡努图克第六嘎查（村）蒙汉人民团结友爱、互助合作的新气象，就是内蒙古自治区蒙汉人民的新生活的生动范例之一。
    第六嘎查共有一百一十多户，有蒙民也有汉民。过去，他们同样遭受日本帝国主义和封建地主阶级的压榨剥削，过着牛马不如的生活。内蒙古自治区人民政府成立以后，蒙汉人民一起翻身了。蒙汉族人民团结一致，开展了大生产运动。据一九五一年冬天初步统计，全嘎查耕地面积比土地改革时增加了百分之二十五强，大小牲畜增加了百分之三十，车辆增加了百分之四十五。
    第六嘎查蒙汉族人民间的新关系，在生产合作上表现得特别明显。过去，有些汉人总是耻笑蒙古人民不会耕地；蒙古人民又不愿向汉人学习。几年来，蒙汉族人民团结互助，积极生产；很多蒙古人民不但学会了种田，而且学会了精耕细作、积肥施肥。另一方面，汉人也从蒙族人民那里学会了饲养、管理牲畜的好方法。蒙汉族人民在自愿两利的原则下，还组织了互助组。随着农牧业生产的提高，第六嘎查的文化教育事业也日益发展。解放以前，该嘎查只有二十几名蒙汉族学生，现在，已经有了六十多名学生。这是在解放以前人们所想不到的情景。
    内蒙人民从亲身体验中，深深知道了只有在中国共产党、中央人民政府领导下，和各族人民紧密团结在一起，才能创造今天欣欣向荣的日子。  熬海
