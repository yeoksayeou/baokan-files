Another Important Achievement in China's Machine Industry
Xiao Fuli Successfully Creates Automatic Turret for Lathe

Xiao Fuli, a lathe operator in the Machine Workshop of the Jinan Second Machine Factory under the East China Industrial Department, successfully created an automatic turret for lathes during the "Three-Anti" Campaign. This invention not only improved production efficiency and product quality, but more importantly, overcame the difficulty of retracting the cutting tool when implementing high-speed cutting methods.

Last year, the Second Machine Factory implemented high-speed cutting methods, and production efficiency generally increased by more than seven times. However, an important problem remained unresolved. This was that when cutting various precision lead screws using high-speed cutting methods, there was often not enough time to retract the tool, resulting in damage to the product and the tool. This also caused disconnections between work processes. The automatic turret for lathes created by Xiao Fuli completely solved this problem.

The main features of the automatic turret for lathes are: 1. Simplified technical operation process, improved production efficiency. After the lathe operator sets the dimensions and starts the machine, the machine does everything except loading and unloading the workpiece, so apprentices can work on the lathe. If it is fixed production, one worker can manage three lathes when machining lead screws longer than three feet. 2. Previously, when machining a lead screw with two threads per inch, it was difficult to retract the tool when the speed was 150 revolutions per minute; now, the tool can be retracted even at 1,000 revolutions per minute, ensuring that the product and the tool are not damaged. Moreover, the faster the lathe speed, the better the quality of the product. 3. This automatic turret for lathes has significant promotional value and can be used on both belt-driven and electric lathes, and it can be used for any kind of work.

The automatic turret for lathes created by Xiao Fuli is of great significance to the development of China's machine industry. If this turret is widely promoted in the Second Machine Factory, it can increase the country's wealth by 9.9 billion yuan annually in terms of increased production alone; if it is widely promoted in the national machine industry, it can create even more wealth.

    我国机器工业中又一重要成就
    萧福利创造车床自动刀架成功
    华东工业部济南第二机器厂机工部车工萧福利，在“三反”运动中，创造车床自动刀架成功。这一创造不仅提高了生产效率和产品质量，更重要的是克服了实行高速切削法时退不出车刀的困难。
    第二机器厂去年实行了高速切削法，生产效率普遍提高了七倍多。但是有一个重要的问题没有解决。这就是用高速切削法切削各种精密的丝杠的时候，常常来不及退刀，造成产品和刀具损坏的事故。也因为这个缘故，造成了工序之间脱节的现象。萧福利创造的车床自动刀架，完全解决了这个问题。
    车床自动刀架的主要特点是：一、简化技术操作过程，提高了生产效率。车工把尺寸定好，开车以后，除了上活下活外，别的事情完全由机器来作，因此，学徒都能上车干活。如果是固定生产，在车三尺以上的丝杠的时候，一个工人可以管三部车床。二、以前车一寸两扣的丝杠，每分钟转一百五十转时，就不容易退刀；现在每分钟转一千转也可以退出刀来，还保证产品和刀具不受损坏。而且车床的转速越快，产品的质量越好。三、这种车床自动刀架有重大的推广价值，无论皮带车床或电动车床，都能使用，而且做什么活也行。
    萧福利创造的车床自动刀架，对祖国机器工业的发展有重大的意义。如果在第二机器厂普遍推广这种刀架，仅在提高产量方面，每年就可以给国家增加九十九亿元的财富；如果在全国机器工业中普遍加以推广，就可以创造更多的财富。（王崇训）
