Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 11th: To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a five-day literary and art performance convention in a certain area of the front, reviewing the literary and art force within the army and promoting literary and art work in the army. A total of 514 literary and art workers participated in the convention. Writers Ba Jin, Liu Baiyu, Huang Guliu, and others who came to Korea were invited to visit the convention.

    This convention fully demonstrated the victory of Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art. The thirty-five programs performed profoundly and vividly reflected the rich struggle life in various aspects of the battlefield. The program content included heroic deeds, the relationship between the army and the people, trench life, gratitude for the support of the people of the motherland, the anti-bacterial warfare, and the moving stories of various arms of the military and battlefield medical workers. The forms mainly consisted of crosstalk, clapper talk, drums, storytelling, peep shows, small-scale song and dance, short plays, etc., which were suitable for the war environment and the soldiers' preferences. The "Challenge" program, which demonstrated the troops' efforts to preserve education and learning and the joint merit-making movement, vividly described the typical deeds of veteran soldiers leading new soldiers to learn various battlefield actions, improve their skills, and strive for joint meritorious service; another program, "Trench Count-off," reflected the soldiers' revolutionary optimism and high morale to fight harder and become stronger. Some of these programs were created by the army's literary and art workers during their in-depth experiences of life at the front line and in the companies, while others were created by the soldiers themselves. "The Four Major Characteristics of U.S. Imperialism," written and performed by soldiers Ma Enquan and Gu Lianquan of a certain unit, powerfully portrayed the essence of the enemy's unjust war and the contempt of our soldiers for the enemy; "Singing Praises of Cotton Military Uniforms," performed by a certain unit, movingly sang of the excitement of the Volunteer Army soldiers upon receiving cotton military uniforms and their gratitude for the support of the people of the motherland. These programs were warmly welcomed by the commanders and fighters attending the convention. The "Anti-Bacterial Warfare" program, created promptly by the army's literary and art workers after the U.S. aggressors launched bacterial warfare, powerfully promoted the victorious struggle against bacterial warfare.

    Following Chairman Mao's direction for literary and art work, the army's literary and art workers in the Volunteer Army often formed many front-line performance teams, passing through enemy artillery blockades to perform for the front-line troops. They also frequently helped the soldiers sew and wash clothes, learn culture, and carry out recreational activities. In order to boost morale in a timely manner and cooperate with the ongoing battles, the army's literary and art workers often went to the battlefield after a battle had ended to collect outstanding battle examples and compile them into clapper talks, drum lyrics, and other programs to perform on the trenches. Many army literary and art workers have gloriously rendered meritorious service in literary and art work serving the soldiers. They are respected and loved by commanders and fighters.

    At the end of the convention, writer Liu Baiyu was invited to speak. Liu Baiyu encouraged the literary and art workers present to more thoroughly transform their thinking, strengthen their political studies, and strive to further realize Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    志愿军某部文艺工作者举行文艺节目会演大会
    【新华社朝鲜前线十一日电】为纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年，中国人民志愿军某部在前线某地举行了历时五天的文艺节目会演大会，检阅部队中的文艺大军，推进部队文艺工作。参加会演的文艺工作者共五百十四人。来朝作家巴金、刘白羽、黄谷柳等应邀参观会演。
    这次会演充分表现了毛主席文艺方向的胜利。演出的三十五个节目，深刻地、生动地反映了战场上各方面丰富的斗争生活。节目内容包括英雄事迹、军民关系、阵地生活、感谢祖国人民支援、反细菌战斗争以及各兵种部队和战地医务工作者的动人故事。形式以适合战争环境和战士爱好的相声、快板、大鼓、评词、拉洋片、小型歌舞、短剧等为主。表演部队保教保学、合同立功运动的“挑战”节目，生动地描述了老战士带领新战士学习各种战场动作、提高技术、争取共同立功的典型事迹；另一节目“阵地数来宝”，反映了战士的革命乐观主义精神和愈战愈强的高昂士气。这些节目，有的是部队文艺工作者深入火线、深入连队体验生活的过程中创作出来的，有的是战士自己创作的。某部战士马恩全、顾连全两人编演的“美帝四大特点”，有力地刻划出敌人进行非正义战争的本质和我军战士对敌人的蔑视；某部演出的“说唱棉军装”，动人地唱出了志愿军战士接到棉军装时的兴奋心情和对祖国人民支援的感激。这些节目受到到会指挥员和战斗员们的热烈欢迎。演出的“反细菌战”节目，是部队文艺工作者在美国侵略者进行细菌战以后及时地创作出来的，它有力地推动了反细菌战的胜利斗争。
    志愿军中的部队文艺工作者遵循毛主席的文艺工作方向，经常组成许多阵地演出队，通过敌人炮火封锁区到前线部队中去演出。他们并经常帮助战士们缝洗衣服、学文化和开展文娱活动。为了及时鼓舞士气和配合当时的战斗，部队文艺工作者往往在战斗告一段落时就到战场上去收集出色的战斗事例，编成快板、鼓词等节目在阵地上演出。有许多部队文艺工作者在为战士服务的文艺工作中光荣地立了功。他们受到指挥员和战斗员们的尊敬和热爱。
    大会最后邀请作家刘白羽讲话。刘白羽勉励到会的文艺工作者更彻底地改造思想，加强政治学习，为进一步实现毛主席为工农兵服务的文艺方向而努力。
