Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 25th: Today, on the second anniversary of the Korean War, our chief delegate to the armistice negotiations, General Nam Il, pointed out at the plenary session of both delegations that two years ago, the U.S. government instigated the South Korean army to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, launching the Korean War that continues to this day. The U.S. troops came to Korea from thousands of miles away, slaughtering the Korean people and destroying Korean cities and villages. The Korean people will never forget the responsibility that the other side should bear for launching the war of aggression against Korea, and the people of the world will never forgive it. General Nam Il vehemently denounced the other side's blatant violation of the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention, attempting to use distorted, fabricated, and sophistical methods to insist on the absurd claim of detaining prisoners of war. The other side inappropriately compared the final ultimatum of the victorious Soviet army in the battles of World War II demanding the surrender of the surrounded German and Hungarian enemy combat troops to defend the other side's absurd claim of detaining prisoners of war. The facts cited by the other side have nothing to do with the current issue, and they confuse the treatment of enemy combat troops with prisoners of war. The other side also appears to regard itself as the victor. General Nam Il pointed out: This is not allowed in armistice negotiations where both sides are on an equal footing, and the other side should immediately withdraw this insulting remark to our army. General Nam Il continued to sternly question the other side, is it respecting the individual rights and dignity of prisoners of war to slaughter prisoners of war and detain prisoners of war? Is it complying with the Geneva Convention to deprive prisoners of war of the right to repatriation, which is explicitly stipulated in the Geneva Convention and cannot be waived under any circumstances? The absurdity of the other side's remarks is like denying that one plus two equals three. There should be no place for such absurd remarks in the armistice negotiations. The issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can go home and live peaceful lives, fully complies with the Geneva Convention, and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. General Nam Il finally solemnly reminded the other side that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are armies that uphold the truth. Any provocative actions or threats taken by the other side outside the meeting cannot change our firm and unwavering stance.

    二十五日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    我痛斥美国发动侵朝战争
    并指责美方坚持扣留战俘的荒谬主张
    【新华社开城二十五日电】在朝鲜战争两周年的今天，我方停战谈判首席代表南日将军在双方代表团大会上指出：两年前，美国政府指使南朝鲜军队进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，发动了继续到今天的朝鲜战争。美国的军队远从几千哩以外来到朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民，毁灭朝鲜城市和乡村。对方对于发动战争侵略朝鲜所应负的责任是朝鲜人民永远不会忘记，世界人民永远不能饶恕的。南日将军痛斥对方悍然违反日内瓦公约的明文规定，企图用歪曲、捏造和诡辩的办法坚持扣留战俘的荒谬主张。对方比拟不伦地引用胜利的苏军在第二次世界大战的战斗中要求被包围的德、匈敌人战斗部队投降的最后通牒，来为对方扣留战俘的荒谬主张作辩护。对方所引的事实对当前问题毫无关系，而且把对待敌人战斗部队与战俘混为一谈。对方又俨然以战胜者自居。南日将军指出：这是双方处于平等地位的停战谈判中所不容许的，对方应立即撤消此种侮辱我军的言论。南日将军继续严词质问对方，难道屠杀战俘和扣留战俘是尊重战俘的个人权利和尊严？难道剥夺日内瓦公约所明文规定战俘在任何情况下不得放弃的遣返权利是遵守日内瓦公约？对方言论的荒谬直如否认一加二等于三。在停战谈判中不应该有这种荒谬言论的地位。战俘遣返问题必须在日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决。我方五月二日方案保证双方战俘得以回家过和平生活，完全符合日内瓦公约，是解决战俘遣返问题唯一合理的基础。南日将军最后郑重提醒对方，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军是坚持真理的军队。对方在会外所采取的任何挑衅行动，任何威胁，都不能改变我方这个坚定不移的立场。
