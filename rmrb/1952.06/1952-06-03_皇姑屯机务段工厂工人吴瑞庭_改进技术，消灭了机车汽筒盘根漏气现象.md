    Wu Ruiting, a Worker at the Huangguantun Locomotive Depot Factory, Improves Technology and Eliminates Steam Cylinder Packing Leakage

    Editor: The biggest difficulty encountered by the Huangguantun Locomotive Depot in terms of repairs in recent years has been steam cylinder packing leakage. This problem often prolongs the time locomotives spend in the depot, affecting their operation. During the "Three-Anti" Movement, the depot issued a call to eliminate steam cylinder packing leakage. Wu Ruiting, a tinsmith worker at the locomotive depot factory, and foreman Lao Yan said, "Since the higher authorities have called for it, we must do it, otherwise we would really be letting Chairman Mao down!" They immediately accepted this arduous task. In order to gain experience, Wu Ruiting went to the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot and the Huangguantun Railway Factory to learn how to cast steam cylinder packing. After returning, the cast steam cylinder packing still had pinholes when tested. He thought about it for a long time and finally found the reason: the casting temperature was too high, and the copper, lead, and other materials were not mixed evenly. In response to this situation, he improved the operating method and completely eliminated the pinholes in the steam cylinder packing. When the No. 冖丂63339 locomotive was undergoing scheduled maintenance, the steam cylinder packing did not leak any air at all. Wu Ruiting couldn't stop smiling, and he told his fellow workers, "We will never be complacent with this small success, and we will continue to study and create more new operating methods." Because the leakage of steam cylinder packing was eliminated, the time spent on scheduled maintenance of locomotives in the depot in April was reduced by 45% compared to the departmental standard.

    皇姑屯机务段工厂工人吴瑞庭
    改进技术，消灭了机车汽筒盘根漏气现象
    编辑同志：皇姑屯机务段几年来在检修方面遇到的最大困难，是机车汽筒盘根漏气。这一毛病经常延长机车在库停留时间，影响机车的运用。“三反”运动中，段上提出消灭汽筒盘根漏气的号召。机务段工厂白铁组工人吴瑞庭和领工员老阎说：“上级号召，我们说啥也得做到，不然真对不起毛主席！”他们立刻接受了这一艰巨的任务。为了吸取经验，吴瑞庭先后到苏家屯机务段和皇姑屯铁路工厂学习了铸造汽筒盘根的方法。回来后一试验，铸出来的汽筒盘根还是有砂眼。他琢磨了好久，才找出原因是铸造时温度太高，铜、铅等料子混合不均匀。他针对这种情况，改进了操作法，完全消灭了汽筒盘根的砂眼。在定检冖丂六三三三九号机车的时候，机车汽筒盘根一点气也不漏了。吴瑞庭乐得闭不上嘴，他向工友们表示：“决不以这一点成功骄傲自满，一定继续钻研，创造更多新的操作法。”由于消灭了汽筒盘根的漏气现象，这个段四月份定检机车在库停留时间，比部定标准缩短了百分之四十五。　张成忠
