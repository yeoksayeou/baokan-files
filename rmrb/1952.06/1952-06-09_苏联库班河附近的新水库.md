    New Reservoir Near the Kuban River in the Soviet Union
    In the middle reaches of the Kuban River, a huge reservoir has been excavated a few kilometers from Krasnodar. Local residents call it the "Shapsugsk Sea." This reservoir will irrigate 7,500 hectares of paddy fields and, during the dry season, will keep the water level of the Kuban River at a navigable height.
    Tens of millions of rubles have been spent on this construction project. Collective farmers in the Krasnodar Krai provided large-scale assistance to this construction project. They helped build an embankment that is 25 kilometers long and 7 meters high. The slopes on both sides of the embankment are paved with concrete bricks. Trees have also been planted there.
    The banks of this new reservoir will become a center for recreation. A shallow beach has already been laid out, and a water sports arena will be built.

    苏联库班河附近的新水库
    在库班河中游，距克拉斯诺达数公里的地方已经掘凿了一个巨大的水库，当地的居民称它“夏普苏格斯克海”。这个水库将灌溉七千五百公顷稻田，在水枯的季节，将使库班河的水平面保持在可以通航的高度。
    在这个建设计划上面已经用了几千万卢布。克拉斯诺达边疆州的集体农民给予这个建筑工程大规模的帮助。他们帮助建立了一道长达二十五公里和高达七公尺的土堤。这个土堤的两面斜坡都铺着混凝土砖块。那里并已种了树。
    这个新水库的岸边将成为娱乐的中心。那里已经铺成一片浅滩，并将建立一个水上运动场。
