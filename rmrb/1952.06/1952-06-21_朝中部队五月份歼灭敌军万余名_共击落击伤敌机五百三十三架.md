Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 20th—In May, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers repelled frequent enemy attacks, annihilating 10,784 enemy troops. Among them, 5,361 were American invading troops.

The American aggressors, who are using various rogue tactics to delay the armistice negotiations, launched the most frequent small-scale offensives since the beginning of this year in May. On several occasions, they used forces of more than a battalion, and coordinated their operations with aircraft and a large number of tanks. In the Gaolangpu-ri area on the western front alone, there were three large-scale offensives, but each offensive was heroically repelled by the Korean and Chinese People's Forces. For example, in the battle in the Jilingdong area northeast of Panmunjom and its vicinity on May 28, four companies of the U.S. invading army's main force, the First Marine Division, fiercely attacked our positions under the cover of ten aircraft and more than twenty tanks. However, under the calm and brave counterattack of our defending troops, the invading army suffered more than 300 casualties and gained nothing, while our positions still stood firmly in front of the enemy. In May, our army fought a total of 188 battles with the enemy, killing and wounding a large number of enemy troops. The U.S. invading army's 45th Infantry Division and the First Marine Division alone suffered 2,655 casualties in this month.

In the battles in May, the Korean and Chinese People's artillery units increasingly became an important force in attacking the enemy. The enemy, while gathering or moving, often suddenly encountered the fierce bombardment of our artillery fire and suffered heavy casualties. The enemy moving on the positions was also often hit by our artillery shells. In fierce battles, the enemy's artillery was sometimes silenced. Our artillery fire destroyed 56 enemy guns of various types in this month.

May was the month in which our army shot down and damaged the most enemy aircraft since the beginning of the Korean War. Since April, American air bandits have adopted the so-called "key point assault" tactic in the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces, attempting to destroy the transportation lines of the Korean and Chinese forces and destroy the peaceful cities and towns of North Korea. However, the enemy aircraft carrying out "key point assaults" have suffered increasingly heavy blows. In May, our army shot down and damaged 533 enemy aircraft. The commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese People's air defense forces said with confidence: If the enemy dares to carry out "key point bombing," we will give them a "concentrated blow"! An anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in a certain area of ​​northern Korea repelled the attacks of more than 20 batches of more than 200 enemy aircraft on May 8 alone, shooting down and damaging 27 enemy aircraft. A certain unit of the Korean People's Army guarding a mountain ridge position on the eastern front shot down five enemy aircraft with various anti-aircraft weapons in one day on May 13.

Our coastal defense forces vigilantly and strongly defended the coastline, and in May repelled two landing incursions by small groups of enemy troops under the cover of warships on the west coast.

The American aggressors, who are constantly suffering military failures and serious difficulties, in addition to stubbornly holding on to the absurd demand of detaining 100,000 of our captured personnel and massacring our captured personnel, continue to wage germ warfare and gas warfare against our army. However, the American aggressors' various perverse practices will never succeed; the Korean and Chinese People's Armies have shattered and will continue to shatter all the conspiracies of the American aggressors.

According to incomplete statistics, the main achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in May are as follows: 1. Annihilated 10,784 enemy troops, including 5,361 American invading troops, 134 British accomplice troops, 84 Canadian accomplice troops, 283 Turkish accomplice troops, and 4,922 Syngman Rhee puppet troops.

2. Captured 36 enemy light and heavy machine guns, 265 various guns, 1 rocket launcher, 1 radio station, 7 intercoms, 21 walkie-talkies, and 4 pairs of binoculars.

3. Shot down 234 enemy aircraft, damaged 299 enemy aircraft, for a total of 533 enemy aircraft shot down and damaged. Destroyed 50 enemy tanks, damaged 41 enemy tanks. Destroyed 56 guns of various types. Destroyed 91 enemy vehicles.

    朝中部队五月份歼灭敌军万余名
    共击落击伤敌机五百三十三架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在五月份中打退了敌军频繁的进攻，歼灭敌军一万零七百八十四名。其中美国侵略军占五千三百六十一名。
    用各种流氓手段拖延停战谈判的美国侵略者，在五月份中发动了今年以来最为频繁的小股进犯，有不少次使用兵力在一个营以上，并有飞机和大批战车配合作战。仅在西线高浪浦里地区，就有三次较大规模的进犯，但每次进犯都被朝中人民部队英勇击退。如在五月二十八日板门店东北智陵洞及其附近地区的战斗中，美国侵略军主力部队海军陆战队第一师的四个连，在十架飞机、二十多辆战车掩护下，猛犯我军阵地，但在我守军沉着勇敢的迎击下，侵略军除遭受三百多名伤亡外，什么东西都没得到，而我军阵地仍强固地屹立于敌前。五月份中，我军与敌共作战一百八十八次，杀伤了大量敌军。仅美国侵略军第四十五步兵师和海军陆战队第一师，在这一个月中即被我毙伤两千六百五十五名。
    在五月份的各次战斗中，朝中人民炮兵部队日益成为打击敌人的重要力量。正在集结或运动中的敌人，往往突然遇到我军炮火的猛烈轰击，遭受很大杀伤。在阵地上行动的敌人，也常被我军炮弹击中。在激烈战斗中，敌军大炮有时被打得哑然无声。我军炮火在这一个月中共击毁敌军各种炮五十六门。
    五月份是我军自朝鲜战争开始以来击落击伤敌机最多的一个月。美国空中强盗自四月份起在朝中人民部队后方采取所谓“重点突袭”的战术，妄图破坏朝中部队的运输线，摧毁北朝鲜的和平城乡。但进行“重点突袭”的敌机却遭到了愈来愈沉重的打击。五月份我军共击落击伤敌机五百三十三架。朝中人民防空部队的指挥员和战斗员们充满信心地说：敌人敢来“重点轰炸”，我们就给它个“集中打击”！朝鲜北部某地的一支志愿军高射炮队，在五月八日的一天中就打垮了二十多批、二百多架次敌机的袭击，击落击伤敌机二十七架。守卫在东部前线某山岭阵地上的朝鲜人民军某部，在五月十三日一天中用各种高射火器击落了五架敌机。
    我海防部队警惕地坚强地保卫着海岸线，五月份在西海岸击退了小股敌军在军舰掩护下的两次登陆窜犯。
    不断地遭受军事失败和严重困难的美国侵略者，除了固执扣留十万名我方被俘人员的荒谬透顶的要求、屠杀我方被俘人员外，仍继续向我军进行细菌战和毒气战。但是，美国侵略者种种倒行逆施的做法绝不会成功的；朝中人民军队已经粉碎并将继续粉碎美国侵略军的一切阴谋。
    据不完全统计，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军五月份的主要战果如下：一、歼灭敌军一万零七百八十四名，其中美国侵略军五千三百六十一名，英国帮凶军一百三十四名，加拿大帮凶军八十四名，土耳其帮凶军二百八十三名，李承晚伪军四千九百二十二名。
    二、缴获敌军轻重机枪三十六挺，各种枪支二百六十五枝，火箭筒一个，电台一部，对话机七部，步行机二十一部，望远镜四副。
    三、击落敌机二百三十四架，击伤敌机二百九十九架，共击落击伤敌机五百三十三架。击毁敌军战车五十辆，击伤敌军战车四十一辆。击毁各种炮五十六门。击毁敌军汽车九十一辆。
