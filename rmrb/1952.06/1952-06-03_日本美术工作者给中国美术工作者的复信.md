Editor's Note: On September 21, 1951, the All-China Federation of Fine Arts Workers sent a letter to all Japanese artists, encouraging them to wage a staunch and unyielding righteous struggle for the freedom and liberation of the Japanese people; and expressing that, under the goal of striving for peace and democracy, Chinese artists should work more closely with Japanese artists. Enclosed with the letter were selected collections of Chinese woodcuts, prints, picture books, and New Year pictures. The following is the reply from Japanese artists.

Dear friends, fellow Chinese artists and cultural workers:
We express our deepest gratitude for your letter filled with friendship and your precious gifts sent on the eve of the celebratory October 1st.

We express our heartfelt respect to you—fellow artists—who, under the brilliant leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, are victoriously fighting for the liberation of all Asian peoples and the people of the world.

You are our truly great guides, our sincere friends, and no one can sever the increasingly solid relationship between us.

As you pointed out, the separate peace treaty concluded by the imperialists and our country's reactionaries without the participation of your country and the Soviet Union infringes upon the happiness and independence of China, the Soviet Union, and all Asian peoples. They have already launched an invasion of China and the Soviet Union in Korea, slaughtering innocent people. The separate peace negotiations place our nation in a state of colonial servitude, making our people mercenaries of imperialism. This conspiracy of imperialism has been clearly exposed.

Currently, our country's fine arts and culture are being destroyed under the destructive policies of the Liberal Party's Yoshida Cabinet. The nation's artistic heritage is being plundered and stolen by foreign imperialism without reservation. The independent and autonomous artistic and cultural activities of the workers and peasants are being undermined by reactionary forces. The lives of artists are impoverished, and creative and group activities are not free.

At this time, what constantly encourages us and points us in the right direction is none other than your experience in serving the liberation movement of 400 million people through artistic and cultural activities.

Mao Zedong's talks on literature and art not only guide you but are also our classics.

Friends of New China, fellow Chinese artists and cultural workers:

Under the policy of uniting all the people for national peace and independence, we have realized that our woodcut art movement must conform to the expectations of the people and be rapidly reformed and refreshed. We will live up to your expectations and strive to transform and temper ourselves.

Your encouragement and gifts will become our own strength and examples for our work.

We have begun to distribute your works and art collections through various means. Workers, students, and citizens are all jubilant. Those who have come into contact with you for the first time are very surprised, and those who are fighting for liberation are greatly encouraged.

While expressing our heartfelt gratitude, we hope that you will closely assist us in the future.

Wishing you victory!

                                    Fellow Japanese National Artists

### 日本美术工作者给中国美术工作者的复信

    日本美术工作者给中国美术工作者的复信
    编者按：一九五一年九月二十一日，中华全国美术工作者协会写信给全日本美术工作者，鼓励他们为争取日本人民的自由解放而进行坚强不屈的正义斗争；并表示在争取和平与民主的目标下，中国美术工作者要和日本美术工作者更紧密地携手前进。随信并寄去中国木版、版画选集、连环画、年画等美术作品。下面是日本美术工作者的复信。
    亲爱的朋友们，全中国美术文化工作者同志们：在值得庆祝的十月一日的前夜，你们寄来了充满友情的信和珍贵的礼物，我们表示深切的谢意。
    我们对在毛泽东同志的天才领导下，为全亚洲民族、全世界人民的解放而节节胜利地斗争着的你们——美术工作者同志们，表示由衷的敬意。
    你们是我们真正伟大的指导者，我们真诚的朋友，不论谁都不可能割断我们之间的日益坚固的关系。
    正如你们所指出的，没有贵国和苏联参加的，帝国主义者和我国反动派缔结的单独和约，是侵犯了中国、苏联以及全亚洲人民的幸福和独立的。他们已经在朝鲜掀起了对中苏侵略的起端，屠杀着无辜的人民。单独媾和使我们民族处于殖民地的被奴役地位，使我国人民成为帝国主义的雇佣兵，帝国主义的这个阴谋已经明显地暴露出来了。
    目前，我国的美术文化已在自由党的吉田内阁的破坏政策下被毁坏着。民族的美术遗产将不留丝毫地被外国帝国主义所掠夺、盗窃，工农大众的独立自主的美术文化活动，在受着反动势力的摧残，美术家的生活困惫不堪，创作和团体活动也不得自由。
    这时，不断鼓舞着我们并指给我们以正确方向的，不是别的，正是你们为四亿人民的解放运动而服务的美术文化活动的经验。
    毛泽东的文艺讲话，不但指示了你们，而且也是我们的经典。
    新中国的朋友们，全中国美术文化工作者同志们：
    在为民族的和平与独立而团结全体人民的政策下，我们已觉悟到我们的木刻美术运动必须符合人民的期望而迅速地进行改革、刷新。我们将不辜负你们的期望，努力改造和锻炼自己。
    你们的鼓励和赠品，将成为我们自身的力量和我们工作的榜样。
    我们已开始将你们寄来的作品和画集通过各种形式分发下去。工人、学生、市民们都欢欣鼓舞起来，初次接触过你们的人都很惊讶，为了解放而斗争的他们，受了很大的鼓励。
    我们在表示衷心感谢的同时，更希望你们今后紧密地协助我们。
    祝你们胜利！
                                    日本国民美术工作者同仁
