Xinhua News Agency, New York: The voices of the American people demanding a ceasefire in Korea, opposing the use of bacteriological weapons, and striving for world peace are growing louder day by day.

The American "Crusade for Peace" issued a statement to the press saying that forty-one prominent Americans have jointly written an open letter to Truman, demanding that the US government ratify the Geneva Protocol banning germ warfare, calling on Truman to achieve peace in Korea, and suggesting a conference of representatives to draft a peace treaty between the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. Those who signed the letter include: Mrs. Bass, Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate, novelist Brewster, International Longshore and Warehouse Union President Bridges, National Marine Cooks and Stewards Union President Bryson, historian Dr. Du Bois, sociology professor Professor Van Ee Fairchild, writers Fast, Cohn, singer Robeson, William Harrison, assistant managing editor of the Boston-based black newspaper "Chronicle," former Virgin Islands Governor Professor Lovett, Iowa Farmers Union President Stover, painter Gottlieb, and others.

According to the New York "Daily Worker," the American "Crusade for Peace" is planning to hold a mass peace conference on June 25, the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.

In New York, peace advocates frequently hold gatherings. On the evening of June 5th, peace advocates held a demonstration and march in Herald Square, New York's main business district, under the slogan of defending peace and stopping the Korean War. The marchers distributed leaflets demanding a ceasefire in Korea and the withdrawal of American troops. At the end of May, the American "Crusade for Peace" and the New York Peace Committee held a grand peace rally at the St. Nicholas Arena, attended by 2,500 people. The conference called on Truman to meet with the heads of other major powers and demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. Mrs. Shuna, whose son was captured in Korea, received warm applause when she read an open letter from her son and 91 other prisoners of war. The letter called on the American people to strive for "the issuance of a final formal ceasefire order so that we can all return home to live the happy lives we should and be useful citizens for the rest of our lives."

Since coming to New York from San Francisco, Mrs. Shuna has been visiting newspaper offices and homes, promoting her son's letter as she did in San Francisco. She has found in both cities that not only the families of prisoners of war, but also many other families, are equally anxious and equally hopeful that the war will end. Another Mr. Nelson, at the request of his captured son, wants to meet with Lie and the US representative to the United Nations, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Korea.

The Chicago Labor Peace Conference also held a large-scale gathering on May 27th. Chicago union workers attending the conference demanded an end to the Korean War and the exchange of all prisoners of war "in accordance with the wishes of American soldiers and the terms of the Geneva Convention." Delegates heard a report by bacteriologist Dr. Hirsch on the United States' use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean people.

He pointed out the dangers of germ warfare and called on delegates to demand that the United States ratify the Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons.

The Michigan Peace Committee held a meeting in Detroit on May 24th. Those attending the meeting demanded an immediate ceasefire in Korea, the repatriation of all prisoners of war, and the immediate ratification of the Geneva Protocol banning germ warfare.

    美国人民要求朝鲜停战并交换全部战俘
    芝加哥劳工和平会议和美国社会名流多人反对细菌战
    【新华社讯】纽约消息：美国人民要求在朝鲜停战、反对使用细菌武器和争取世界和平的呼声，正日益响亮。
    美国“和平十字军”向新闻界发表声明说：四十一位美国社会名流联名写给杜鲁门一封公开信，要求美国政府批准禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书，要求杜鲁门在朝鲜实现和平，并建议召开代表会议，以拟订美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国之间的和平公约。在信上签名的有：进步党副总统候选人巴斯夫人、女作家勃陆斯特、国际码头与仓库工人工会主席布里治、全国海船厨师侍者工会主席勃里逊、历史学家杜波依斯博士、社会学教授范爱却尔德教授、作家法斯特、康恩、歌唱家罗伯逊、波士顿出版的黑人报纸“纪事报”助理总编辑维廉·哈里逊、前维尔京群岛总督劳维特教授、衣阿华州农民联盟主席斯图佛、画家葛特利布等人。
    据纽约“工人日报”报道：美国“和平十字军”正筹划在六月二十五日朝鲜战争爆发二周年纪念日，举行群众性的和平大会。
    在纽约，经常有和平拥护者举行集会。六月五日晚上，和平拥护者在保卫和平与制止朝鲜战争的口号下，在纽约大商业区先驱广场举行示威游行。游行的人散发传单，要求在朝鲜停战并撤回美军。在五月底，美国“和平十字军”和纽约和平委员会曾在圣尼古拉竞技场举行盛大和平联欢大会，参加大会的有二千五百人。大会要求杜鲁门与其他大国元首会谈，并要求美国军队撤出朝鲜。儿子在朝鲜被俘的舒纳太太，在会上宣读她的儿子和其他九十一名战俘的公开信时，获得了热烈的掌声。这封公开信呼吁美国人民争取“发布最后的正式停火令，使得我们都能回国过应该过的幸福生活，毕生做一个有用的公民”。
    舒纳太太自旧金山来纽约后，逐家访问各报馆，各家庭，像她在旧金山那样宣传她儿子的信。她在这两个城市中发现，不仅是战俘的家庭，而且其他许多家庭都同样地极感焦虑，都同样地希望战争结束。另一位纳尔森先生应他的被俘的儿子的请求，要想会见赖伊和美国驻联合国的代表，要求立刻在朝鲜停战。
    芝加哥劳工和平会议也曾在五月二十七日举行大规模集会。参加大会的芝加哥各工会工作者要求“依照美国士兵的愿望和日内瓦公约的条款”结束朝鲜战争和交换全部战俘。代表们听取了细菌学家希尔许博士关于美国对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器的报告。
    他指出细菌战的危险性，并号召代表们要求美国批准禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。
    密执安州和平委员会五月二十四日在底特律举行会议。参加会议的人们要求立即在朝鲜停战，遣返全部战俘，并立即批准禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。
