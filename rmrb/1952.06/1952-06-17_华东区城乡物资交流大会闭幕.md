The East China Regional Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference successfully concluded on June 13th. The conference successfully organized the exchange of industrial and agricultural products between urban and rural areas, with a transaction volume reaching 1,743.15767 billion yuan, exceeding the conference's planned target by more than two times. Among these, native and special products accounted for 64.12%, and industrial products accounted for 35.88%. Spot transactions accounted for 29.04%, futures transactions accounted for 62.69%, and other methods such as spot-futures, barter trade, consignment sales, and entrusted purchases accounted for 8.27%. The futures contracts signed are generally for three or six months and can be fully executed within this year. The conference expanded the exchange of materials, basically solved the current problem of unsalable native and special products and unsalable industrial products in the East China region, improved the business enthusiasm of private industrialists and merchants, and played a significant role in supporting and guiding production and enlivening the market.

The phenomenon of stockpiled native and special products in various parts of East China this spring was very serious. Many industrial products in Shanghai and other major cities in East China were also heavily stockpiled due to the temporary stagnation of urban-rural materials exchange this spring, resulting in the shutdown or reduced production of some factories. Through the materials exchange at this conference, the sales of most native and special products have been resolved, except for a small number of severely unsalable products that do not suit mass needs and have no prospects for development. Some private manufacturers in Shanghai have completely sold out their inventories that had been stockpiled for more than ten years. The materials exchange through this conference has enabled Shanghai and some medium-sized cities in the East China region to overcome the difficulties of off-season production.

The exchange business of the conference has played a great role in guiding and promoting industrial and agricultural production and improving quality, and has promoted the reform of products with non-standard specifications. Dyes, knitted goods, underwear, toothbrushes, and other products related to people's lives are in short supply. Shanghai's ink and carbon paper manufacturing industries, in view of the fact that some goods could not be sold due to non-standard specifications, are now brewing reforms to improve quality.

Another significant achievement of this conference is that it greatly enhanced the business confidence of private industrialists and merchants. At the beginning of the conference, some representatives of private enterprises had a unclear understanding of the people's government's policy of "taking into account both public and private interests and developing production", had little interest in urban-rural materials exchange, and were not enthusiastic about production and management, holding a wait-and-see and perfunctory attitude at the conference. Later, in actual transactions, they received the care and support of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, which changed their original attitude and increased their enthusiasm for business. In the proportion of transactions at the conference, industrial products sold by private enterprises accounted for 45.14%, and native products accounted for 7.73%. Industrial products purchased by private enterprises accounted for 17.78%, and native products accounted for 25.67%. The value of various materials purchased by private merchants in Shanghai alone accounted for 24.5% of the total purchase value of Shanghai.

The main reason why the East China Regional Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference was able to achieve the above-mentioned great achievements in the short thirteen days of exchange business is first of all because the conference spent three days on ideological and policy education, criticizing many incorrect ideas in the business operations of state-owned enterprise personnel, such as being constrained, not daring to let go of transactions, only selling but not buying, or buying less and selling more, and focusing on conducting policy education for private industrialists and merchants, repeatedly mobilizing and helping private industrialists and merchants to actively conduct urban-rural materials exchange. Secondly, the conference resolutely implemented and carried out the business policy of "native products as the main focus, industrial products as secondary; currently unsalable products as the main focus, popular products as secondary". Representatives from various places were able to conduct transactions in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, actively exchanging, buying and selling, and mutual assistance and benefit, so that many unsalable products gradually solved the problem of sales. Third, a variety of transaction methods were adopted. In addition to free transactions, the conference also organized regional and professional seminars to drive the sales of unsalable goods with popular goods, and created three-way barter trade and four-way barter trade methods. For example, northern Jiangsu purchased sulfur from Hunan, Hunan purchased brown sugar from Guangdong, Guangdong purchased peanut oil from Shanghai, and Shanghai purchased cottonseed oil from northern Jiangsu, opening up sales channels for various products.

    华东区城乡物资交流大会闭幕
    华东区城乡物资交流大会于六月十三日胜利闭幕。大会成功地组织了城乡工、农业产品的交流，成交额达一万七千四百三十一亿五千七百六十七万元，超过大会预定任务两倍以上。其中土产、特产品占百分之六十四点一二，工业品占百分之三十五点八八。现货现款交易占百分之二十九点零四，期货期款占百分之六十二点六九，其他现货期款、以货换货、委托代销、委托代购等方式占百分之八点二七。所订期货合同一般都是三个月或六个月，在今年内都能全部执行。大会扩大了物资交流，基本上解决了华东区目前滞销的土产、特产及滞销工业品的出路，提高了私营工商业者的经营积极性，对扶持和指导生产，活跃市场起了重大作用。
    华东各地今春土产、特产品积压的现象非常严重。上海及华东各地主要城市的许多工业品，也由于今年春季城乡物资交流的暂时停滞，积压很多，致使部分工厂停工、减产。经过这次大会的物资交流，除一小部分不适合大众需要、无发展前途的严重滞销品外，一般土产、特产品的销路都解决了。上海市有些私营厂商积压十多年的存货，现在也完全销光。通过这次大会的物资交流，使上海和华东地区部分中等城市的淡季生产困难得以克服。
    大会的交流业务，对指导和推动工业、农业生产，提高质量，起了很大的作用，并促进那些规格不合的产品的改革。和人民生活有关的染织品、针织品、内衣织造品、牙刷等都供不应求。上海市墨水和复写纸等制造行业鉴于有些货品因不合规格而销不出去，现正酝酿进行改革，提高质量。
    这次大会另一巨大成就，是大大提高了私营工商业者的经营信心。在大会开始时，部分私营企业代表对人民政府的“公私兼顾，发展生产”的政策认识不清，对城乡物资交流的兴趣不大，生产经营情绪不高，在大会上抱观望和应付态度。后在实际交易中，得到国营企业和合作社的照顾和扶持，才改变了原来的态度，提高了经营的积极性。在大会的成交比重上；私营企业销出的工业品占百分之四十五点一四，土产品占百分之七点七三。私营企业购入工业品占百分之十七点七八，土产品占百分之二十五点六七。仅上海私商购买各种物资价值就占上海市购买总值百分之二十四点五。
    华东区城乡物资交流大会在短短十三天的交流业务中，能够获致上述巨大成就的主要原因，首先是大会以三天时间进行了思想和政策的教育，批判了国营企业人员业务经营中的许多不正确思想，如束手束脚、不敢放手交易、只卖不买、或少买多卖等的本位主义思想，并着重对私营工商业者进行了政策教育，在大会上反复动员和帮助私营工商业积极进行城乡物资交流。其次是坚决执行和贯彻了大会“以土产为主、工业品为副；目前滞销品为主、畅销产品为副”的业务方针，各地代表都能本着实事求是、积极交流、有买有卖、互助两利的精神进行交易，使许多滞销品都逐步地解决了销路问题。第三是采用了多种多样的交易方式，除了自由交易外，大会又组织了地区及专业等座谈会，以畅销货带动滞销货，并创造了三边易货交易和四边易货交易等方式，如苏北向湖南购进硫磺，湖南向广东购进赤糖，广东向上海购进花生油，上海又向苏北购进棉清油，为各种产品打开了销路。（新华社）
