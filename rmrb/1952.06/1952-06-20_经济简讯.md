    Economic Briefs

    ▲ The Shenyang Industrial Equipment Company has changed its comprehensive sales department into specialized stores, which has greatly improved the supply of industrial construction materials. This experience is now being promoted in cities such as Harbin and Dalian. Specialized stores make it easier for customers to purchase goods, and sales volume has increased significantly, with sales revenue increasing fivefold compared to the past. Employees' enthusiasm for studying their profession has also greatly increased due to specialization, changing the past phenomenon of being unable to master complex commodities and not being at ease with their work. The Northeast Industrial Equipment Company has instructed various regions to follow suit and establish specialized warehouses, and to establish specialized storage areas within at least one warehouse, in order to maintain close contact with specialized stores.
    ▲ The fourth session of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Qingdao Sanatorium has officially opened, with more than ninety labor models and outstanding workers from various regions arriving in Qingdao in early May to enter the sanatorium for recuperation. The China Textile Workers' Sanatorium, planned and built by the China Textile Trade Union, has also begun construction. The construction project of the sanatorium began in mid-March in a scenic coastal area near Qingdao, and is expected to be completed between July and August this year.
    ▲ In order to ensure a bumper harvest, farmers in various parts of Northeast China are vigorously carrying out field inspections, replanting seedlings, and preventing drought and pests. In May, most areas of Northeast China lacked rain, and some areas had too much rainfall, resulting in uneven seedling emergence in autumn fields. In addition, individual areas have also suffered from wind, frost, and hail disasters, and the crops have also suffered some losses. Therefore, after sowing, the people's governments in various parts of Northeast China immediately led farmers to inspect the fields and replant seedlings. Now, farmers in various parts of Northeast China are conducting universal inspections of the crops. Experience has proven that organized and regular field inspections are an effective way to prevent and control pests. In this way, pests can be detected early, preventing them from spreading, and making them easier to catch and kill.

    ▲沈阳市工业器材公司将综合门市部改为专业商店，使供应工业建设材料的工作得到很大改进。现在这一经验已在哈尔滨、旅大等市推广。专业商店便于顾主们购买，销货量显著提高，卖钱额较过去增加了五倍。营业员也因为实行专业化后，钻研业务的情绪大大提高，改变了过去因为无法掌握复杂的商品而不安心工作的现象。东北区工业器材公司指示各地仿行并建立专业仓库，至少要在一所仓库内建立专业分区保管，以便与专业商店取得密切联系。
    ▲中华全国总工会青岛疗养所第四期已正式开办，各地劳动模范和优秀职工九十多人在五月上旬陆续抵青岛入所休养。中国纺织工会筹建的中国纺织工人休养院，也开始动工兴建。该院的兴建工程，于三月中旬在青岛近郊景致美丽的海滨地区开始修建，预计到今年七、八月间可以完工。
    ▲为保证丰收，东北各地农民正大力进行查田、补苗、防旱、防虫等工作。五月间东北大部地区缺雨，又有少数地区雨水过多，秋田出苗不齐。另外个别地区还发生过风、霜和雹灾，田禾也受了一些损失。因此，东北各地人民政府在播种结束后，曾立即领导农民查田补苗。现在，东北各地农民都在对田禾进行普遍检查。经验证明：有组织经常查田，是防治虫害的有效办法。这样虫害发现得早，不致蔓延，捕打也很容易。
