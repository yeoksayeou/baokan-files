Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th (TASS dispatch): The following is the speech of Soviet representative Malik at the Security Council meeting on June 18:

The Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, has submitted the issue of banning bacteriological weapons for discussion by the Security Council. The wording of this issue on the agenda of the Security Council is as follows: "The question of calling on all states to accede to and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons."

As everyone knows, the issue of prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons in warfare has long been a focus of attention for international public opinion and the peoples and governments of all countries. Everyone is clearly aware that the League of Nations also paid close attention to this issue at the time. After years of discussion on this issue, the institutions of the League of Nations drafted and signed a famous international agreement, which is known in international relations and international law practice as the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

Without a doubt, this protocol is of great importance in the history of international relations over the past twenty-five years. The political and moral obligations undertaken by countries under this international agreement – obligations under international law, greatly constrained aggressor countries, which took aggressive actions more than once during the above period, and ultimately launched the Second World War.

None of these aggressor countries dared to risk disregarding the significance of the above-mentioned Geneva Protocol. The aggressors could not ignore the great international, political, legal, and moral significance of the provisions of this protocol regarding the prohibition of the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in warfare. It is also remembered that, when drafting the Charter, the United Nations paid special attention to the tasks of maintaining and consolidating international peace and security and promoting friendly relations between nations.

To this end, the UN Charter stipulates many measures to accomplish this task, and the Security Council was established and entrusted in the Charter with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.

The Charter also made many provisions for carrying out the tasks of disarmament and arms limitation.

As early as December 14, 1946, the first session of the General Assembly adopted a resolution on the principles of universal limitation and reduction of armaments, stipulating that it is necessary to "prohibit and eliminate from the armaments of all nations atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable now or in the future to mass destruction."

The General Assembly considered such a prohibition to be a matter of urgency.

Because the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons was discussed back and forth in the United Nations, people did not pay attention to the issue of banning bacteriological weapons – a shameful weapon of mass destruction of people – which is extremely important for peace.

The Secretary-General of the United Nations later also emphasized the importance of this issue in a report submitted to the Third General Assembly. This report called attention to the fact that bacteriological and chemical weapons are a great danger because such weapons have massive destructive power, and called attention to the fact that the manufacture and storage of these weapons have already posed a serious threat to international peace and security. The report also pointed out that no one has yet submitted any proposal to the United Nations on this issue, and the United Nations has generally not discussed the issue of banning bacteriological weapons.

At present, politicians and public leaders in various countries have different opinions on whether the use of bacteriological weapons should be permitted, although everyone knows that the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, prohibits the use of such weapons.

Therefore, it is necessary to urge the Security Council to pay special attention to a statement contained in the Geneva Protocol, which states that the public opinion of the civilized world justly condemns the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices.

The countries that signed and acceded to this protocol unanimously agreed to this important international declaration. According to this declaration – that the public opinion of the civilized world justly condemns the use of the above-mentioned weapons of mass destruction, the provisions prohibiting the use of these weapons are equally binding on the conscience and practical actions of all countries, as the Geneva Protocol has made clear.

The Security Council should pay particular attention to the fact that, in this important international agreement, all participating countries unanimously agreed that the items prohibited from use include not only asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and any similar liquids, materials and methods, but also bacteriological weapons. Therefore, the Geneva Protocol includes a special clause stating that the countries signing the protocol not only confirm the prohibition of the use of various poisonous gases and various similar substances, but also unanimously agree to apply this prohibition to bacteriological weapons.

The countries signing the protocol not only concluded the above-mentioned international agreement on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, but also, as the original text of the protocol points out, they assumed formal international obligations: to do everything in their power to induce other states to accede to this protocol.

As everyone knows, forty-eight countries have signed and acceded to the Geneva Protocol, accounting for an overwhelming majority of the world's countries, including all the major powers.

It should be particularly pointed out here that, of the forty-eight countries that have signed or acceded to the Geneva Protocol, only a very few, six countries, have not ratified the protocol.

In general, forty-two countries have signed, acceded to and ratified the Geneva Protocol; only six countries, the United States, Japan, Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Uruguay, have not ratified the Geneva Protocol.

It is also worth noting that, of the eleven member states of the current Security Council, only two countries – the United States and Brazil – have not ratified the Geneva Protocol, a fact known to the world.

The fact that the vast majority of countries in the world, including the permanent members of the Security Council – except the United States – have signed and ratified the Geneva Protocol demonstrates the importance of this international agreement and the great significance of the international political, legal, and moral obligations arising from this agreement. This agreement also contains a clause stating that the signatory states declare their aim to secure universal acceptance of this prohibition, as part of international law. The fact that this international agreement has been ratified by forty-two countries undeniably proves that the Geneva Protocol and its clauses and provisions prohibiting gas warfare and bacteriological warfare have become a standard of international law, and, as the protocol states, it is equally binding on the conscience and practical actions of all countries.

I have already pointed out that there are currently divergent opinions among politicians and social leaders in many countries regarding whether the use of bacteriological weapons, which are prohibited by the Geneva Protocol, can be permitted.

Due to this situation, and because the development of the production of bacteriological and chemical weapons poses a threat to international peace and security, the United Nations needs to take appropriate measures to prevent the use of these weapons.

In view of the great significance of this issue for international relations and for maintaining and consolidating international peace and security, the United Nations must discuss this issue.

The Security Council bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and taking necessary measures to consolidate peace.

The Security Council must also fulfill its responsibilities regarding this important issue affecting peace. In accordance with the powers conferred by the UN Charter, the Security Council must take measures to prevent the use of bacteriological weapons prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.

Because some countries are preparing for bacteriological warfare, posing a threat to international peace and security, it is also necessary for the Security Council to discuss this issue. In order to fulfill its responsibility to maintain and consolidate international peace and security, the Security Council must take measures to prevent the use of bacteriological weapons prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.

The Soviet Union suggests issuing an appeal to all countries that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Geneva Protocol, requesting them to accede to and ratify the Protocol and undertake the obligation to strictly abide by the Geneva Protocol. Needless to prove, the Security Council's adoption of this measure is of great international significance, and the Security Council's making this decision for the cause of international peace and security is of great significance.

If the Security Council makes this decision, this will emphasize to people the great international significance of the Geneva Protocol and the great significance of the international obligations arising from this protocol.

Now, in view of the above circumstances, this decision of the Security Council will be an important contribution to consolidating international peace and security.

The Soviet Union, consistently pursuing a firm policy of consolidating peace and international security – a policy of consolidating peace and developing friendly relations between all countries and peoples – has specially submitted this issue to the Security Council for discussion, and proposes to adopt the following resolution:

"(1) In view of the divergent opinions among politicians and public leaders in various countries regarding the question of whether the use of bacteriological weapons can be permitted;

"(2) In view of the fact that forty-two countries have signed the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, thus demonstrating that world opinion is unanimously and justly condemning the use of bacteriological weapons;

"(3) Therefore decides:

"To call on all countries that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, signed on June 17, 1925, whether or not they are members of the United Nations, to accede to and ratify the above-mentioned Protocol."

The Soviet delegation has submitted this issue to the Security Council for discussion, and requests the Security Council to pay attention to the proposal I have read; The Soviet delegation believes that the Security Council member states, especially the member states that have ratified the Geneva Protocol, abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and are striving to maintain international peace and security, they will definitely support this proposal aimed at maintaining and consolidating international peace and security.

### 马立克在十八日安理会上的发言

    马立克在十八日安理会上的发言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十日电：苏联代表马立克在六月十八日安全理事会会议上的发言如下：
    苏联代表团奉苏联政府之令，提出了禁止细菌武器的问题供安全理事会讨论。这个问题在安全理事会议程中的措辞如下：“号召各国参加及批准一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的问题”。
    大家都知道，禁止在战争中使用细菌武器的问题早就是国际舆论及各国人民和政府所集中注意的问题了。大家清楚知道，国际联盟当时也曾非常注意这个问题。国际联盟的机构对这个问题讨论多年之后，就草拟和签订了一个著名的国际协定，这个协定在国际关系中以及在国际法实践中称之为一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
    毫无疑问，这个议定书在过去二十五年的国际关系史上是非常重要的。各国根据这个国际协定所承担的政治上和道义上的义务——国际法的义务，大大约束了侵略国，侵略国在上述时期中曾不止一次采取了侵略行动，最后发动了第二次世界大战。
    这些侵略国没有一个敢于冒险把上述日内瓦议定书的意义置于脑后。侵略者不能把这个议定书中关于禁止在战争中使用化学和细菌武器的规定所具有的伟大的国际、政治、法律及道义上的意义置之不顾。人们还记得，在制定宪章时，联合国对于维持与巩固国际和平与安全的任务以及促进国际友好关系的问题，曾给予特别的注意。
    为此，联合国宪章规定了许多措施，以求完成这一任务，并且成立了安全理事会，在宪章中责成其担负维持国际和平与安全的主要任务。
    宪章还作出了许多规定以求完成裁减军备与限制军备的任务。
    大会第一届会议早在一九四六年十二月十四日就通过了关于普遍限制与裁减军备原则的决议，规定必须“禁止并从各国军备中取消原子武器和一切其他能够在现在或将来用来进行大规模毁灭的基本军备”。
    大会认为这样的禁令是当务之急。
    由于裁减军备与禁止原子武器问题在联合国中讨论来讨论去，大家就没有注意到禁止细菌武器——大规模毁灭人民的可耻的罪恶的武器——这样一个对和平极为重要的问题。
    联合国秘书长后来在提交第三届大会的报告中也着重指出了这个问题的重要性。这个报告要求注意，细菌武器和化学武器是一个巨大的危险，因为这种武器具有大规模的毁灭力，并要求注意制造及存储这些武器对国际和平与安全已经造成了严重的威胁。这个报告并指出，还没有人就这个问题向联合国提出过任何建议，联合国一般也没有讨论过禁止细菌武器的问题。
    目前，各国的政治家和公众领袖对于是否准许使用细菌武器的问题有不同的意见，虽然大家都知道，一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书是禁止使用这种武器的。
    因此，有必要促请安全理事会特别注意日内瓦议定书中所载的一项声明，这项声明说，文明世界的舆论公正地谴责在战争中使用窒息性毒气及其他毒气以及使用任何类似的液体、物质和方法。
    签署及参加这个议定书的各国一致同意这个重要的国际声明。根据这个声明——即文明世界的舆论公正地谴责使用上述大规模毁灭的武器，禁止使用这些武器的规定对各国的良知和实际行动是同样有约束力的，这一点日内瓦议定书已说明了。
    安全理事会应该特别注意这样的事实：在这个重要的国际协定中，所有参加协定的国家都一致同意，禁止使用的物品中不仅包括窒息性毒气及其他毒气以及任何类似的液体、物质和方法，而且包括细菌武器。所以，日内瓦议定书中包括了一个特别条款，说明签署议定书的国家不仅确认禁止使用各种毒气与各种类似的物质，而且一致同意把这个禁令应用于细菌武器。
    签署议定书的国家不仅缔结了上述关于禁用细菌武器的国际协定，而且正如议定书原文所指出的，它们还承担了正式的国际义务：尽力鼓动其他国家参加这个议定书。
    大家知道，签订和参加日内瓦议定书的有四十八个国家，占世界国家的压倒多数，其中包括所有的大国。
    在这里应该特别指出的是，在签订或参加了日内瓦议定书的四十八个国家中，只有极少的六个国家没有批准议定书。
    总的说来，有四十二个国家签订、参加并批准了日内瓦议定书；只有美国、日本、巴西、尼加拉瓜、萨尔瓦多和乌拉圭六国没有批准日内瓦议定书。
    目前安全理事会的十一个理事国中，只有两个国家——美国和巴西——没有批准日内瓦议定书，这个举世皆知的事实也是值得指出的。
    全世界绝大多数国家，包括安全理事会的常任理事国——美国除外——都已签署了并批准了日内瓦议定书，这一事实证明了这个国际协定的重要性，以及这个协定所产生的国际政治上、法律上、道义上的义务的重大意义。这个协定中并有这样的一个条款：签字国宣布它们的目的是要使全世界都通过这个禁令，作为国际法的一个标准。这个国际协定已为四十二个国家所批准，这一事实不容置辩地证明了日内瓦议定书及其禁止毒气战与细菌战的条款与规定已经成为国际法的一个标准，正如议定书所说，它对于各国的良知和实际行动有着同样的约束力。
    我已经指出，目前许多国家的政治家和社会领袖间对于是否可以允许使用为日内瓦议定书所禁止的细菌武器一节存在着分歧的意见。
    由于这种情况，又由于细菌武器与化学武器的生产的发展对国际和平与安全造成了威胁，所以需要联合国采取适当的措施，来防止使用这些武器。
    鉴于这个问题对国际关系以及对维持和巩固国际和平与安全的重大意义，联合国必须讨论这个问题。
    安全理事会负有维持国际和平与安全以及采取必要措施以巩固和平的主要责任。
    安全理事会对于这个影响和平的重要问题也必须履行它的职责。依照联合国宪章所赋予的权力，安全理事会必须采取措施阻止使用日内瓦议定书所禁止使用的细菌武器。
    由于某些国家正在准备细菌战争，对国际和平与安全造成了威胁，因此也使得安全理事会有必要讨论这个问题。安全理事会为了要履行它的维持并巩固国际和平与安全的责任，必须采取措施阻止使用为日内瓦议定书所禁止的细菌武器。
    苏联建议向迄今为止一直没有参加或批准日内瓦议定书的一切国家发出呼吁，要求它们参加并批准该议定书，承担严格遵守日内瓦议定书的义务。不待证明，安全理事会采取这一措施是具有重大国际意义的，安全理事会为了国际和平与安全事业而作出这一决定是具有重大意义的。
    如果安全理事会作出这一决定，这将给人们强调指出日内瓦议定书的伟大国际意义和这个议定书所产生的国际义务的伟大意义。
    现在，鉴于上述情况，安全理事会的这一决定对巩固国际和平与安全将是一个重要的贡献。
    苏联一贯奉行巩固和平与国际安全的坚定政策——巩固和平与发展一切国家与人民之间的友好关系的政策，特把这个问题提交安全理事会讨论，并建议通过以下决议：
    “（一）鉴于各国政治家和公众领袖对能否容许使用细菌武器的问题存在着分歧的意见；
    “（二）鉴于四十二个国家签订了一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，因而表现了全世界舆论一致公正地谴责使用细菌武器；
    “（三）因此决定：
    “号召凡是至今仍未批准或参加一九二五年六月十七日签订的关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的国家，不论其是否为联合国会员国，应一律参加并批准上述议定书。”
    苏联代表团把这个问题提交安全理事会讨论，并要求安全理事会注意我已宣读过的提案；苏联代表团相信安全理事会理事国，首先是已批准日内瓦议定书的理事国，是遵守联合国宪章的宗旨和原则并为维护国际和平与安全而奋斗的，它们一定会支持这个旨在维护与巩固国际和平与安全的建议。
