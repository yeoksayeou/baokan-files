    Preparatory Process of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Representative Conference
    Sha Qianli
    Chairman, fellow representatives, comrades:
    The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is opening today after more than seven months of preparation. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will also be established soon, and the task of the preparatory office will then be completed. The completion of this task is inseparable from Chairman Mao's concern, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the promotion and assistance of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the leaders of relevant agencies and regions. We would like to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and express our gratitude to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, relevant agencies, and leaders of various regions.
    The establishment of a new national organization for the industrial and commercial sector was first discussed as early as 1949 during the preparation for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but the conditions of the industrial and commercial sector itself at that time limited the realization of this organization. Last October, at the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai raised the issue of a national organization for industry and commerce in his political report; some industrial and commercial representatives attending the meeting in Beijing also expressed their desire to form a national federation of industry and commerce. Based on this situation, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference believed that the time was ripe for the establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and appointed Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Secretary-General Li Weihan, and Member Zhang Naiqi to be responsible for promoting the preparatory work. After they convened a forum of industrial and commercial representatives attending and observing the Third Session of the National Committee, everyone unanimously decided that the preparatory work should be carried out in three steps: first, establish a preparatory office; second, convene a preparatory representative conference to establish a preparatory committee; and third, convene a national congress of industry and commerce to establish the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Subsequently, the Standing Committee of the National Committee appointed three people, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the Ministry of Trade, and the People's Bank of China each appointed one person, and each major administrative region appointed two people from the industrial and commercial sector to form the preparatory office, formulate regulations, report to the Standing Committee of the National Committee for approval, and begin work.
    According to the regulations approved by the Standing Committee of the National Committee, the preparatory office is merely a working body, not an organ of power. Its main tasks are: (1) to formulate the methods for the election of representatives to the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and to promote and coordinate the work related to the election of representatives; (2) to draft the regulations of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and to prepare the necessary work for the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    After several studies, the preparatory office formulated the methods for the election of representatives and submitted them to the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for approval and publication in January this year. Representatives are divided into three categories: regional representatives, representatives of national state-owned enterprises and cooperative headquarters, and specially invited representatives. The allocation of regional representative quotas among regional units takes into account the specific circumstances of each region, giving consideration to key areas and overall coverage. Consideration is given to industry and commerce, state-owned and private sectors, large, medium, and small enterprises, major and minor industries, groups and individuals, and ethnic minorities. Consideration is also given to cities, counties, banners, and towns, and candidates are nominated through consultation. Special invited representatives are used to invite democratic figures from the industrial and commercial sector and responsible comrades from relevant agencies, as well as representatives of overseas Chinese, representatives of industry and commerce from Hong Kong and Macao, and representatives of ethnic minorities. Subsequently, the preparatory office consulted with relevant parties and stipulated the approximate ratio of representatives from large, medium, and small enterprises in order to ensure that representatives from large, medium, and small enterprises are appropriately allocated. At the same time, in order to address the difficulties in allocation in some regions, it was reported to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for approval to increase the number of places to facilitate rational adjustment. Through such careful research and allocation, and subsequent adjustments, all regions and aspects have obtained appropriate representative quotas and nominated appropriate candidates, thus ensuring that this preparatory representative conference has comprehensive representation. Currently, there are a total of 414 representatives, of which 320 are representatives of private industry and commerce.
    The Preparatory Representative Conference was originally approved by the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to be convened on March 15th, but was postponed to mid-June due to the unfolding of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. In order to prepare for the convening of this conference, in addition to formulating the methods for the election of representatives and paying attention to the nomination of representatives, the preparatory office also carried out a number of other tasks. First, it formulated the organizational rules of the Preparatory Representative Conference, and submitted them to the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for approval and publication at the same time as the methods for the election of representatives. Next, it drafted the charter of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the budget and collection methods for the Preparatory Committee's expenses, and the estimated start-up costs and sharing methods, all of which will be submitted to this conference for discussion. During this period, the preparatory office also collected a lot of information from local federations of industry and commerce, which provided a lot of help to the work of the preparatory office. As the conference date approached, the preparatory office obtained the assistance of relevant departments in May and organized a temporary working committee for the Preparatory Representative Conference to start preparing for the conference. The expenses of the preparatory office during the preparation period and the expenses of this conference were all approved by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and reported to the state treasury for disbursement, which shows the government's emphasis on our conference.
    Now, the national industrial and commercial sector has experienced
    an unprecedented transformation movement in the great "Five-Anti" movement. The preparatory representative conference is convened on this basis, and the preparatory task of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce will be jointly undertaken by all of you. We believe that this will help the healthy development of China's industry and commerce, and will help the great construction movement of our great motherland. I wish the conference success!

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议筹备经过
    沙千里主席团、各位代表、各位同志：
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，经过七个多月的筹备工作，今天开幕了。中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会亦即将产生，筹备处的任务于是完成了。这个任务的完成，是与毛主席的关切，中国共产党的领导，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会及各有关机关各地区首长的推动和协助分不开的。我们要向毛主席和中国共产党致敬，向中国人民政协全国委员会及有关机关和各地区首长表示感谢。
    建立一个工商界的新的全国性的组织，这件事远在一九四九年中国人民政治协商会议进行筹备的时候，就已经开始谈到了，但当时工商界本身的条件，限制了这个组织的实现。去年十月中国人民政协全国委员会召开第三次会议的时候，周恩来总理在政治报告中提出了工商业全国性组织的问题；来京参加会议的一部分工商界代表也表示了对于筹组全国工商业联合会的要求。根据这种情况，人民政协全国委员会常务委员会认为筹组全国工商业联合会的时机已初步成熟，并推定陈叔通副主席和李维汉秘书长、章乃器委员，负责推动筹备工作。经他们约集出席、列席全国委员会第三次会议的工商界代表座谈的结果，大家一致确定筹备工作分三个步骤进行：第一步建立筹备处；第二步召开筹备代表会议产生筹备委员会；第三步召开全国工商界代表大会，成立全国工商业联合会。随即由全国委员会常务委员会推定三人，政务院财政经济委员会、贸易部、人民银行各推定一人，各大行政区工商界每区推定二人，组成筹备处，制定章程，报经全国委员会常务委员会核准，开始工作。
    根据全国委员会常务委员会核准的章程，筹备处仅是一个工作机构，而不是权力机关，他的工作，主要是：（一）拟定中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的代表产生办法，并进行关于产生代表的推动和联系工作。（二）草拟中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会的各项章则，并准备全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的必要工作。
    筹备处经过多次研究，拟定了代表产生办法，于今年一月报经中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员会核准公布。代表计分三类，即地区代表，全国性国营企业、合作社总机构代表，及特邀代表。地区代表名额在各地区单位间的分配，是斟酌各地区的具体情况，照顾重点，照顾全面。照顾工业与商业，国营与私营，大、中、小企业，主要与次要行业，团体与个人，少数民族。并照顾市、县、旗、镇，以协商方法推定人选。特邀代表名额则用以邀请工商界民主人士和有关机关的负责同志，并邀请了华侨代表、港澳工商界代表和少数民族代表。嗣后，筹备处又与有关方面协商，规定了大、中、小企业代表的大约比数，以便大、中、小企业代表获得适当的分配。同时，为了照顾若干地区分配上的困难，又报经人民政协全国委员会核准，增加名额，以利于合理调整。经过这样慎重研究分配，又经过其后的调整，因此各地区各方面都已获得适当的代表名额，推出了适当的代表人选，因而使这次筹备代表会议获得了全面的代表性。现总计代表四百一十四人，内私营工商业代表三百二十人。
    筹备代表会议原经人民政协全国委员会常务委员会核准于三月十五日召集，嗣因“三反”运动和“五反”运动的展开，延期至六月中旬举行。为着准备这个会议的召开，筹备处除了拟定代表产生办法并注意代表推选工作外，还进行了多项的工作。首先是制定筹备代表会议组织条例，已同时与代表产生办法报经人民政协全国委员会常务委员会核准公布。接着起草了中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会章程，筹备委员会经费预算及征收办法，开办费概算及分担办法，均将提交这次会议讨论。在此期间，筹备处还向各地工商业联合会征集了不少的资料，这些资料给筹备处的工作很多帮助。随着会期的临近，筹备处于五月间即取得有关部门的协助，组织了筹备代表会议临时工作委员会，着手进行会议的准备工作。关于筹备处在筹备期间的开支，和这次会议的经费，是全部由人民政协全国委员会核准，报由国库开支的，这表示政府对我们会议的重视。
    现在全国工商界在伟大的“五反”运动中经历了
    一次空前的改造运动，在此基础上召开了筹备代表会议，以后全国工商业联合会的筹备任务，即将由各位共同担负起来。我们相信这将有助于中国工商业的健康的发展，有助于我们伟大祖国的伟大建设运动。敬祝会议成功！
