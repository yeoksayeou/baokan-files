Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 18th: The French democratic party, the Progressive Republican League, held its Second National Congress in Paris on June 14th and 15th. More than 200 delegates from all over the country attended the conference.

    The conference issued a declaration on the current international and domestic situation in France, calling on "Radical Party members, Socialist Party members, Communist Party members, Popular Republican Movement members, trade union federations and organizations that participated in defending the Republic, and all prominent Republicans" to conclude a "minimum common program" that does not affect their respective views, but can provide a basis for taking the following joint actions: "Stop arming Germany; end the war in Indochina; promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; demand respect for the letter and spirit of constitutional freedoms, which were won at a great price in 1944 and 1945; and guarantee the social gains achieved after the liberation of France." The declaration concludes: "France must now make a choice: either establish a reactionary dictatorial government or unite the democratic forces. The working class, the middle class, and the peasants must unite immediately so that France can prevent repeating the mistakes of the period from 1851 to 1940."

    法国民主政党进步共和联盟
    主张各党联合反对独裁政府
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国的民主政党进步共和联盟于六月十四日和十五日在巴黎召开第二次全国代表大会。出席大会的，有全国各地代表二百多人。
    大会就目前国际形势和法国国内形势发表宣言，号召“激进党人、社会党人、共产党人、人民共和党人、参加过保卫共和国的各工会联合会和组织以及所有著名的共和人士”缔结一项“最低共同纲领”，这个纲领不影响他们各自的见解，但是能为采取以下的联合行动提供基础：“制止武装德国；结束在印度支那进行的战争；促成和平解决朝鲜问题；要求尊重宪法自由的文字和精神，这是在一九四四年和一九四五年付出了巨大的代价后才赢得来的；保障法国光复以后所取得的社会果实。”宣言最后说：“法国目前必须作选择：不是成立一个反动的独裁政府，就是使民主力量联合起来。工人阶级、中产阶级和农民必须立刻团结起来，这样就能防止法国重蹈它在一八五一年到一九四零年期间的覆辙。”
