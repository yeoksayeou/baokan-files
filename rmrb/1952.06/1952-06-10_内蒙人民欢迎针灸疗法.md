    Inner Mongolian People Welcome Acupuncture Therapy
    To the Editor: The working people of Inner Mongolia warmly welcome acupuncture therapy. In the past, the people of Inner Mongolia suffered from the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and the Kuomintang bandits, living a life worse than that of animals. They could not get enough to eat, were poorly clothed, and lived in damp, dilapidated houses. Many people suffered from mental illness, hysteria, gastrointestinal diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, when they fell ill, they had no money for treatment; even if they had money, there was nowhere to seek medical care. After liberation, the brilliance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao shone upon Inner Mongolia. The People's Government established hospitals, health stations, and epidemic prevention teams for the people of Inner Mongolia, alleviating the suffering of many diseases.

    The people of Inner Mongolia greatly welcome acupuncture therapy. Among the Inner Mongolian cadres who come to Beijing for treatment, eight out of ten use acupuncture. There are reasons why they prefer acupuncture for treatment. Lu Shukuan, an old railway worker from Inner Mongolia, suffered from sciatica and sought treatment for a year and a half, changing three hospitals without success. Finally, he was cured with acupuncture. After the first needle, his cold thigh immediately warmed up, and after three more needles, he could walk without crutches. A Mongolian from Chahar League, hearing that acupuncture was so effective, sent a relative suffering from schizophrenia from the distant grasslands to Beijing for acupuncture treatment. This proves how much the people of Inner Mongolia believe in acupuncture therapy.

    Currently, transportation in Inner Mongolia is not very convenient, and medical equipment is still insufficient. Simple and economical acupuncture therapy is very suitable for the needs of the people of Inner Mongolia. It is hoped that health authorities will quickly promote this acupuncture therapy extensively in the Inner Mongolia region to relieve the suffering of the vast number of farmers and herdsmen in Inner Mongolia from illness.

    内蒙人民欢迎针灸疗法
    编辑同志：内蒙劳动人民热烈欢迎针灸疗法。过去，内蒙人民受着帝国主义、封建势力、国民党匪帮的重重压迫，过着牛马不如的生活。他们吃不饱，穿不暖，住着阴湿的破屋子，很多人得了精神病、脏燥症、肠胃病和关节风湿病。但是，他们有了病没有钱治疗；即使有钱，也无处医治。解放以后，共产党、毛主席的光辉照到了内蒙，人民政府给内蒙人民建立了医院、卫生站和防疫队，解除了内蒙人民许多疾病的痛苦。
    内蒙人民很欢迎针灸疗法。来北京治疗的内蒙干部当中，十分之八都用针灸治疗。他们所以这样喜用针灸疗法治病，是有原因的。内蒙老铁路工人卢树宽坐骨神经痛，医了一年半，换了三个医院，都没有治好，最后以针灸疗法治好了。扎了第一针他的冰冷的大腿立即暖和，又扎了三针，他不用拐杖也能走路了。察盟有一位蒙民，听说针灸疗法这样有效，就把他的一位患精神分裂症的亲戚，从远方的草原，送到北京，使用针灸疗法治疗。这证明内蒙人民是如何信仰针灸疗法。
    现在内蒙的交通还不很方便，医疗设备还是不够，简便省钱的针灸疗法是非常适合内蒙人民的需要的。希望卫生机关尽速地把这种针灸疗法在内蒙地区普遍推行，以解除内蒙广大农牧民的疾病痛苦。
