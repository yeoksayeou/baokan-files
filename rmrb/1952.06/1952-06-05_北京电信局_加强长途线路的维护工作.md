    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
    Strengthens Maintenance of Long-Distance Lines
    Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Kou Boyuan on May 12, criticizing the error of the Long-Distance Station Chief of the Long-Distance Division of our bureau for abandoning the maintenance of long-distance lines. We believe that Comrade Kou Boyuan's opinion is correct. After the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, many line workers from outside sections were transferred to Beijing to participate in "Three-Anti" studies. This temporarily disrupted the original maintenance management organization, so that production work in the first quarter could only maintain the status quo. The Fengtai and Changxindian business offices have repeatedly raised opinions on strengthening maintenance work, but Liu, the acting station chief of the long-distance station, not only did not pay attention to these opinions, but also delayed responding on the grounds that the "Three-Anti" movement was busy. Our bureau's Long-Distance Division also failed to promptly check the work of the Long-Distance Station, which is the reason for the waste of manpower. From this review, we also found that there is a bias in maintenance work that emphasizes "machine maintenance" and neglects "line maintenance." Now, in addition to ordering Acting Station Chief Liu to conduct a deep self-criticism, we have also instructed the Long-Distance Division to adjust the maintenance personnel in the outer sections and internal management personnel, strengthen the maintenance management system, regularly arrange specific production tasks, and conduct regular inspections to overcome past shortcomings.

### 北京电信局  加强长途线路的维护工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京电信局
    加强长途线路的维护工作
    编辑同志：五月十二日人民日报刊登了读者寇伯元的来信，批评我局长途处长途站站长放弃长途线路维护工作的错误。我们认为寇伯元同志提出的意见是正确的。“三反”运动开始后，许多外段线务员被调来北京参加“三反”学习。这就暂时打乱了原有的维护管理机构，使第一季度的生产工作只能维持现状了。丰台、长辛店两营业处屡次提出加强维护工作的意见，长途站刘代站长不但没有重视这些意见，反而藉口“三反”运动忙，延不答复。我局长途处对长途站的工作，也没有及时加以检查，这是造成人力浪费的原因。从这次检讨中，我们还发现在维护工作上有重“机器维护”轻“线路维护”的偏向。现在，我们除令刘代站长作深刻检讨外，并责成长途处调整外段维护人员及内部管理人员，加强维护管理制度，定期布置具体生产任务，经常检查，以克服过去的缺点。
