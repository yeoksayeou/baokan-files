Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th. Our special correspondent reports: The Korean armistice talks, lasting nearly eleven months, have reached a dangerous stage. The U.S. negotiating representatives are clearly deliberately trying to break the negotiations, but are afraid of public condemnation, so they dare not openly break the negotiations. Instead, they are adopting the method of demanding indefinite adjournment every day, hoping to end the negotiations in this way. It is only because of the world opinion's pressure for peace, and only because General Nam Il firmly insists on continuing the meetings to break the stalemate created by the U.S. side on the issue of prisoners of war, that the negotiations can continue.

The U.S. representatives no longer conceal their desire to interrupt the negotiations. Harrision's first action after replacing Joy was to request a three-day adjournment of the delegation meeting. After the resumption of the meeting, he still stubbornly refused to negotiate as before, insisting that the U.S. demand that 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war not be allowed to return home was "firm, final, and unchangeable."

In the past ten days, Harrision has demanded indefinite adjournment every day. He even said at the conference table: "It seems that there is no beneficial reason to meet every day." His spokesman outside the tent, Nacos, also echoed him, expressing his unwillingness to seek an armistice in Korea, saying: "There is no point in meeting every day." The U.S. plan is clearly to strangle the negotiations with indefinite adjournment.

Harrision's daily routine is to read a pre-prepared statement, repeating the old tunes of so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable" and so-called "re-screening of prisoners of war." He knows very well that these will not be accepted. During the meeting, he always whistles, yawns, listlessly looks at his watch, and finally suggests indefinite adjournment. As soon as adjournment is mentioned, he immediately expresses his agreement, happy to have delayed another day.

The U.S. side's unreasonable behavior has reached its peak, the only thing missing is that it has not openly broken the negotiations. After Joy made an ultimatum-like proposal on April 28th and was resolutely rejected by General Nam Il, the U.S. side has continuously violated the agreement and created incidents. They strafed the Korean and Chinese delegation motorcade, killing a Korean staff member of the delegation. Then, on May 14th, U.S. aircraft strafed Kaesong, dropping parachute flares marked with the words "U.S. Navy," conducting provocative demonstrations.

Recently, the U.S. provocative tactics of sabotaging the negotiations have completely disregarded the protests of the Korean and Chinese side and the lives and deaths of the prisoners of war, continuously and contemptibly massacring unarmed prisoners of war detained by the U.S. Harrision speaks every day about "basic human rights, individual dignity, and value" as the purpose of the U.S. plan. But outside the conference tent, his superior Clark is shouting about "using the greatest force" and letting bare-handed prisoners of war shed more blood. Clark said: "When it comes to bloodshed, what I care about is minimizing the bloodshed on our own troops' side." As for the prisoners of war, the more blood shed, the better.

After Clark left Geoje Island, the prisoners of war were machine-gunned, and many were massacred or injured. Flame-throwing tanks were used against unarmed prisoners of war. A prisoner of war was shot for singing, and four other prisoners of war were shot and wounded by U.S. soldiers because they were "drying clothes on the barbed wire of the camp." This is an island of death, where prisoners of war are isolated and massacred in order to secretly transfer them to the mainland and never allow them to return home.

The prisoners of war in Busan and Yeongcheon on the mainland, who are said to be "preferring death to returning home," why do the U.S. side also isolate them and shoot them in batches? People have not heard an explanation. Because an explanation would reveal all the facts, that is, the detainees on the mainland, like the detainees on Geoje Island, are risking being massacred by the U.S. side and demanding to be repatriated home. Therefore, Harrision and Clark are strictly sealing off the true news about these people, not allowing the facts of these prisoners of war fighting for repatriation to be revealed.

Observers here see very clearly that the U.S. negotiating representatives intend to sabotage the armistice negotiations, so they continue to use massacre and terror to deal with the prisoners of war, in order to deepen the tense situation and continue the Korean War. Harrision intentionally ignores the protests of the Korean and Chinese side and refuses to negotiate, which shows the world that they are determined to implement this conspiracy.

### 美方代表居心破坏朝鲜停战谈判  竟采取每天要求无限期休会的无耻手段

    美方代表居心破坏朝鲜停战谈判
    竟采取每天要求无限期休会的无耻手段
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者报道：历时近十一个月的朝鲜停战谈判已到达危险阶段，美方谈判代表显然是蓄意要破裂谈判，但又害怕公众谴责，才不敢公然使谈判破裂，而采取每天要求无限期休会的方法，希图以此来终止谈判。只是由于世界舆论要求和平的压力，只是由于南日将军坚定地坚持继续开会，以求打破美方在战俘问题上制造的僵局，谈判才得以继续进行。
    美方代表已不再讳言他们想使谈判中断。哈利逊在接替乔埃之后，第一个行动就是要求代表团大会休会三天。在复会后，他仍然和以前一样，顽固地拒绝谈判，坚持美方不让十万朝中战俘回家的要求是“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”。
    在过去十天中，哈利逊天天要求无限期休会。他甚至竟然在会议桌上说：“看来，没有什么有益的理由来天天开会。”他在帐篷外的发言人纳科斯也替他帮腔，表示不愿在朝鲜谋求停战，他说：“天天开会没有什么意思。”美方的计划显然是要用无限期休会的办法把谈判扼死。
    哈利逊每天的例行公事是宣读预先准备好的声明，重弹所谓“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”以及所谓“重新甄别战俘”的老调。他明知道这些是不会被接受的。在会议中，他总是吹口哨，打呵欠，没精打采地看手表，最后建议无限期休会。一提到休会，他就立即表示同意，为着又拖延了一天而高兴。
    美方的无理行为已到了登峰造极的地步，所差的就是还没有公然使谈判破裂。在四月二十八日乔埃提出最后通牒式的建议而为南日将军断然拒绝之后，美方就接连不断地违反协议，制造事件。他们扫射朝中代表团汽车队，打死代表团的一个朝鲜工作人员，跟着美国飞机又在五月十四日扫射开城，投下标有“美国海军”字样的降落伞照明弹，进行挑衅性示威。
    最近以来，美国破坏谈判的挑衅手段，是完全不顾朝中方面的抗议与战俘的生死，连续不断卑怯地屠杀美方所拘留的手无寸铁的战俘。哈利逊嘴巴里天天在说“基本人权、个人的尊严与价值”是美国方案的目的。但在会议帐篷外，他的上司克拉克却在叫喊着“使用最大的武力”与让赤手空拳的战俘流更多的鲜血。克拉克说：“谈到流血，我所关心的是在我们自己的军队这方面尽量少流血。”至于战俘呢，血流的越多越好。
    克拉克离开巨济岛之后，战俘遭到机枪扫射，许多人被屠杀或受了伤。喷射火焰的坦克被用来对付没有武装的战俘。一个战俘因为唱歌而被枪杀，另有四个战俘被美国兵开枪击伤，原因是他们在“营场有刺铁丝网上晒了衣物”。这是一个死亡之岛，在这岛上战俘遭到隔离与屠杀，以便暗中把他们迁到大陆上去，永远不许回家。
    大陆上釜山与永川的战俘，据说是“宁死也不愿回国”的，然而美方为什么也要隔离他们并成批的枪杀他们呢？人们没有听到过解释。因为一解释就要露出全部的事实，即大陆上的被拘人员和巨济岛上的被拘人员一样，都是冒着被美方屠杀的危险而要求遣返回家的。因此，哈利逊和克拉克正在把关于这些人的真实消息严密封锁起来，不许把这些战俘为回国而斗争的事实透露出去。
    这里的观察家看的很清楚，美方谈判代表居心破坏停战谈判，所以继续以屠杀和恐怖手段对付战俘，借以加深紧张状态，使朝鲜战争继续下去。哈利逊有意把朝中方面的抗议置之不理，并拒绝协商，这就向全世界表明了他们立意要实施这个阴谋。
