Our Party is deeply concerned about every matter of the people. The sole starting point and purpose of our Party in carrying out any work is the interests of the people. Apart from the interests of the people, there is nothing more important; apart from the interests of the people, we have no special interests of our own. This is the only reason why our Party is great and can never be defeated. Our Party has now become the ruling party, and many party members have participated in the leadership of the country, with more responsible positions and higher prestige. However, we do not therefore have any special rights; it is only that our obligations and responsibilities to the people are greater than those of other democratic parties and ordinary people. Our Party is leading a large country with a population of 475 million. Such a country cannot be managed by the Communist Party alone. The Communist Party is the leading party, and the working class is the leading class, but it must unite and rely on the people of the whole country to jointly manage the country in order to do a good job. Whether we handle each matter well or badly, and whether the policies we adopt are correct, determines the happiness, suffering, good fortune, and even the survival of the people. Therefore, we Communists must be careful and prudent, closely unite with the people, and constantly listen to the voices of the people, do our work well, and make as few mistakes as possible; if there are mistakes, we must quickly criticize and correct them.

From the incident of Zhang Shunyou's reporting of counter-revolutionaries, what main lessons should and must we learn?

First, we must pay attention to the "small things" of the people. Many things of the people do not seem big, for example, Zhang Shunyou only wanted to catch one counter-revolutionary, not a thousand or ten thousand. Is it an overreaction for us to hold this meeting for Zhang Shunyou's matter? Absolutely not. The smallest things of the people are the foundation of the big things of the people. National affairs are the concentration of the small things of thousands of ordinary people. The people have the demands of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, democratic reform, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. We concentrate the demands of millions of people, and analyze and study them from the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and then formulate our policies and specific tasks. Therefore, we absolutely do not allow and absolutely cannot ignore the small things of the people. Some of our comrades believe that Communist Party members and cadres in national leadership positions should consider the country's policies, large-scale construction undertakings, and the great future of communism. Considering these issues is of course completely necessary and very important; however, we must never despise the specific matters of the people because of this. Zhang Shunyou wanted to catch a counter-revolutionary, and his demands were consistent with the demands of the people, the demands of the country, and the demands of the Party. We should fully support him and oppose those agencies or state employees who do not support or even hinder him. I think it is right and fair to do so. In the old society, such a thing would have happened, and no one could or would have cared about it; in the era of the people, the era of Mao Zedong, our Party and the People's Government must seriously, solemnly, and responsibly take care of this matter, and must not adopt a perfunctory and irresponsible bureaucratic attitude.

Second, we must understand the consistency of being responsible to the people, being responsible to the country, and being responsible to the Party. Some comrades think this way: The tasks of the state, the orders of the Central People's Government, and the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the North China Bureau should be valued; however, the affairs of the people, the affairs of some unsung heroes, and the affairs of someone who cannot even read, seem to be something we may be responsible for or may not be responsible for. They feel that: if I am not responsible to the higher levels, the higher levels will criticize me, inspect me, and even remove me from my post (understanding this is naturally necessary); but it does not matter if I am not responsible to the people. A considerable number of comrades, and even some leading comrades, have split being responsible to the people, being responsible to the country, and being responsible to the Party. This is completely wrong. They do not understand the consistency of being responsible to the people, being responsible to the country, and being responsible to the Party. These comrades should understand that the interests of the people, the interests of the country, and the interests of the Party are consistent; the highest interests of the broadest masses of the people are the standard of truth and the standard of justice; being irresponsible to the people is being irresponsible to the country and to the Party. Therefore, if the masses have any suffering or any problems that cannot be solved, our Party and the People's Government have the responsibility to understand them in detail and solve them. We Communists should be like this: the suffering of the people is our own suffering, and the happiness of the people is our own happiness. The people have stood up, have been liberated, the production cause has developed, new factories have been opened, and the Chinese and Korean people have won battles, and we are happy; the U.S. imperialists massacre our captured personnel on Geoje Island, counter-revolutionaries destroy our factories, and landlords occupy the land of peasants and oppress peasants, and we are sad, and we are indignant. What we hate, what we love, what we oppose, and what we approve of, the only standard is the interests of the people, and there is no and should not be any other standard. When we encounter something, we should see whether this thing is correct or incorrect, and not see whether the person involved is Zhang San or Li Si. It is wrong to abandon something because of the person involved.

Third, we must protect the people's democratic right to report all bad people and bad deeds. This right is sacred and inviolable, and no one can interfere with it. If the people believe that something is unfair, they can appeal to higher levels, all the way to the central government. This right is stipulated in the Common Program and the laws and decrees of the People's Government. Infringing on this right is a major principle error and an illegal act. We should welcome the people's criticism of us, even if it is not completely correct or completely mature. Chairman Mao often taught us: "Those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should be warned." Therefore, we must never reject the criticism and accusations of the people. Instead, we should thank those who help us recognize our mistakes and correct them. If the people have opinions and want us to meet with them, we should take some time to meet with them. Some comrades say: I am very busy with my work, how can I have time to meet with an ordinary person? This idea is wrong. Meeting with the people or representatives of the people and solving the problems of the people is an important task that we cannot shirk. We must reply to the letters and opinions of the masses, and we should reply to them correctly and in a timely manner. Last year, the old revolutionary base area visiting group visited various parts of North China on behalf of Chairman Mao, and the people raised thousands of opinions. We have already forwarded these opinions to the leading organs of various provinces and cities, and all these problems must be seriously dealt with. The affairs of the people must be accounted for in every case, and every case must be settled.

We welcome the criticism of the people; but we cannot allow counter-revolutionaries to use internal democracy to carry out sabotage. Counter-revolutionaries must not be allowed to talk nonsense or act arbitrarily, and they must not have any freedom. Only when they have been reformed and the people have given them democratic rights can they have freedom. This should be noted.

Fourth, we must not be afraid of difficulties or retaliation, and we must adhere to the truth to the end. Zhang Shunyou is glorious in this matter of catching counter-revolutionaries. He was not afraid of difficulties, traveled 15,000 li, went to so many agencies, ran into many snags, suffered many blows, was imprisoned for two hours, and was even handcuffed. This tenacious spirit and hatred of counter-revolutionaries should be commended. However, some of our comrades are afraid to raise their opinions even if they have them, afraid of being retaliated against, and afraid to persist in the struggle. This is because they do not believe in the Party, do not believe that the country belongs to the people, and do not believe that the truth will ultimately prevail. This phenomenon should be overcome. Those who carry out retaliation and attack others, no matter how high their position is or how great their past contributions were, must be punished in order to protect the democratic rights of the people. Our Party and the People's Government must take revolutionary measures to deal with those bureaucratic elements who violate the law, neglect their duties, are irresponsible to the cause of the people, and suppress the democratic rights of the people; if they still do not correct themselves after being educated, they should be resolutely removed from their leading positions and replaced by staff members who can truly serve the people. Recently, we discovered another thing: The county head of Huairen County, Chahar Province, illegally detained a young intellectual who had just joined the work for a few days because this young man criticized his bureaucracy and argued with him. This behavior of the county head of Huairen County is completely wrong and absolutely intolerable. Who gave this county head such a right? If an ordinary person locked up the county head, what would everyone say? I think many people would shout: "This is outrageous! We must severely punish him." Now, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government have begun to investigate this incident, which is completely appropriate. Any elements who infringe on the democratic rights of the people must be given the punishment they deserve.

Our country belongs to the people, and the organs through which the people exercise state power are the People's Congress or the People's Assembly and the People's Government produced by it. For things like the Zhang Shunyou incident and the incident of the county head of Chahar, we should not only publish them in newspapers and broadcast them to expose and criticize them in order to educate everyone, but also discuss them in the relevant People's Congress or People's Assembly to truly give the people the democratic right to elect, inspect, criticize, report, and even remove any staff members of the government. This is absolutely necessary. Doing so can enable the people to further confirm their status and responsibilities as masters. This will have greater educational significance than simply handling it from top to bottom. Comrades must deeply understand this so that they can truly mobilize the masses of the people to supervise all the staff members of our country, so that they can wholeheartedly and better serve the people.

    刘澜涛同志在处理张顺有事件会议上的讲话（摘要）
    我们的党对人民的任何一件事情都是十分关心的。我们的党不论进行任何工作，只有一个出发点，一个目的，就是人民的利益。除了人民的利益这一件事情以外，再没有什么更重要的事情；除了人民的利益以外，再没有自己的任何特殊的利益。这就是我们的党之所以伟大和永远不可被战胜的唯一的原因。我们的党现在成了当政的党，很多党员参加了国家的领导工作，有了更负责的地位和更高的威信。但是，我们并不因此而有任何特殊的权利，只是我们对人民应尽的义务和责任比其他民主党派和普通人民更加重大。我们的党所领导的是一个四亿七千五百万人口的大国家，这样一个国家绝不是仅仅靠共产党员就能管理好的；共产党是领导的党，工人阶级是领导的阶级，但必须团结和依靠全国人民共同来管理国家，才能把国家的事情办好。我们对每一件事情处理的好坏，所采取的政策是否正确，决定着人民的苦乐、祸福，甚至生死存亡。所以我们共产党人必须小心谨慎，紧密团结人民，并且时刻倾听人民的呼声，把工作做好，尽可能地少犯错误；有了错误就要迅速加以批判和纠正。
    从张顺有检举反革命分子这一事件中，我们应当而且必须学习到些什么主要的教训呢？
    第一、要注意人民的“小事情”。人民有许多事情看起来并不大，譬如张顺有只是为了捉一个反革命分子，并不是捉一千个、一万个。我们为了张顺有的这件事召开这个会议是不是小题大作呢？决不是的。人民的最细小的事情，就是人民的大事情的基础。国家大事就是千千万万老百姓的小事情集中起来的。人民群众有镇压反革命的要求，有抗美援朝的要求，有土地改革的要求，有民主改革和“三反”、“五反”等项要求。我们把千百万人民的要求集中起来，用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法加以分析研究，就规定出我们的政策和具体任务。所以，我们绝不允许也绝不能漠视人民的细小的事情。我们有些同志认为：共产党员和国家领导岗位上的干部，应该考虑的是国家的施政方针、大规模的建设事业和共产主义的伟大前途。这些问题的考虑当然是完全必要的，也是很重要的；但是，我们绝不能就因此而轻视人民群众的具体事情。张顺有要捉一个反革命分子，他的要求和人民的要求、国家的要求、党的要求是一致的，我们就应该全力支持他，反对那些不支持甚至阻难他的机关或国家工作人员。我想这样做是应该的，公道的。在旧社会里发生这样一件事情，是没有人也不可能有人来管的；在人民的时代，毛泽东的时代，我们的党和人民政府就必须认真、严肃、负责地来管这件事情，决不能采取敷衍了事不负责任的官僚主义态度。
    第二、要懂得对人民负责、对国家负责和对党负责的一致性。有些同志这样想：国家的任务、中央人民政府的命令、党中央、华北局的决定等应该重视；但是，人民的事情，一些无名英雄、一个大字不识的人的事情，似乎就可以负责也可以不负责。他们觉得：对上级不负责，上级要批评我，检查我，甚至于要撤职（懂得这一条自然是需要的）；但对人民不负责则是不要紧的。有相当一部分同志，甚至是某些领导同志，把对人民负责、对国家负责和对党负责分裂开来了，这是完全不对的。他们不了解对人民负责、对国家负责、对党负责的一致性。这些同志应该明白：人民的利益、国家的利益和党的利益是一致的；最广大人民的最高利益就是真理的标准，正义的标准；对人民不负责任，就是对国家和对党不负责任。因此，群众有什么疾苦，有什么解决不了的问题，我们的党和人民政府就有责任去详细了解并加以解决。我们共产党人应该是这样：人民的痛苦就是我们自己的痛苦，人民的快乐就是我们自己的快乐。人民翻身了，解放了，生产事业发展了，新的工厂开办了，中朝人民打胜仗了，我们就高兴；美帝国主义在巨济岛屠杀我们的被俘人员，反革命分子破坏我们的工厂，地主霸占农民的土地，欺压农民，我们就难过，我们就愤恨。我们仇恨什么，喜爱什么，反对什么，赞成什么，唯一的标准是人民的利益，没有也不应该有其他任何别的标准。我们遇到一件事情，要看这件事情正确或不正确，不要看当事人是张三或李四，因人废事是错误的。
    第三、必须保护人民检举一切坏人坏事的民主权利，这种权利是神圣不可侵犯的，任何人不能加以干涉。如果老百姓认为某件事情不公平，就可以越级控告，一直控告到中央。这种权利是共同纲领和人民政府的法令所规定了的。侵犯了这种权利，就是重大的原则错误，就是犯法的行为。人民对我们的批评，那怕是不完全正确的，不完全成熟的，我们也应该欢迎。毛主席经常教导我们：“言者无罪，闻者足诫。”因此绝不可拒绝人民的批评和指责。而应该感谢那些帮助我们认识错误，改正错误的人。人民有意见要求我们接见，我们就应该抽出一定的时间去接见他们。有的同志说：我的工作很忙，那有时间接见一个普通老百姓呢？这种想法是不对的。接见人民或人民的代表，解决人民的问题，是我们不可推卸的重要的工作。群众来信和群众的意见，我们一定要答复，而且应该及时地正确地答复。去年老根据地访问团代表毛主席到华北各地访问，人民提了几千条意见。这些意见我们已经转给各省市领导机关，所有这些问题都必须认真地加以处理。人民的事情必须件件有交代，案案有着落。
    我们欢迎人民群众的批评；但我们不能容许反革命分子利用人民内部的民主来进行破坏。绝不准反革命分子乱说乱动，他们不得有任何自由。只有在他们经过改造、人民给予他们民主权利时，他们才能有自由。这是应该加以注意的。
    第四、要不怕困难，不怕报复，把真理坚持到底。张顺有在捉反革命分子这件事情上是光荣的。他不怕困难，行程一万五千里，走了那样多的机关，碰了许多钉子，受了许多打击，坐了两小时的监狱，还带过手铐，这一股顽强劲和仇恨反革命分子的精神是应该表扬的。但我们有些同志却是有意见也不敢提，怕受到报复，不敢坚持斗争，这是由于不相信党，不相信国家属于人民，不相信真理最后一定胜利，这种现象应该克服。对于施行报复的人，打击别人的人，不管他们职位有多高，过去功劳有多大，一定要给以处分，以保障人民的民主权利。我们的党和人民政府必须采取革命的手段对付那些违法失职、对人民事业毫不负责而又压制人民民主权利的官僚主义分子；如果经过教育而仍不改正者，应坚决地把他们从领导岗位上撤下来，而代之以真正能为人民服务的工作人员。最近我们又发现一件事情：察哈尔省怀仁县县长，把一位刚参加工作的青年知识分子非法扣押了几天，原因是这位青年批评了他的官僚主义，并和他争吵过。怀仁县长的这种行为是完全错误的，是绝不能容忍的。什么人给了这位县长这样的权利呢？假使一个老百姓把县长关起来，大家会怎样呢？我想，不少人会叫起来：“这还得了！一定要严办。”现在中共察哈尔省委和省人民政府已着手检查这一事件，这是完全应当的。对于侵犯人民民主权利的任何分子，必须给以应得的惩处。
    我们的国家是属于人民的，人民行使国家政权的机关就是人民代表会议或人民代表大会及其所产生的人民政府，像张顺有这一件事情，察哈尔那位县长的事情，我们不仅要登报、广播来加以揭发和批评，以教育大家，而且还应该在各有关的人民代表会议或人民代表大会上进行讨论，确实地赋予人民以选举、检查、批评、检举直至罢免政府任何工作人员的民主权利。这是完全必要的。这样做才能使人民进一步确认自己主人翁的地位和职责。这会比单纯自上而下地来处理是有更大的教育意义的。这一点同志们必须深刻地认识清楚，以便真正发动人民群众来监督我们国家的一切工作人员，使他们全心全意地更好地为人民服务。
