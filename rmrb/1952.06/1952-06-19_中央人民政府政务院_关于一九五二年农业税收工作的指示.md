The general guiding principle for agricultural tax collection in 1952 is: to implement land verification and production determination, calculate and levy taxes according to rates, reduce or exempt taxes according to law, gradually achieve unified progressive taxation, and eliminate all surcharges. Based on this guiding principle, the following instructions are issued regarding agricultural tax collection work in 1952:

    I. The tax system and tax rates for agricultural tax in 1952 shall be implemented in accordance with the following provisions:

    A. All local surcharges on agricultural tax throughout the country shall be abolished. In the future, only a single agricultural tax shall be levied uniformly by the central government on agriculture, without any surcharges.

    B. In 1952, the old liberated areas shall temporarily continue to adopt the proportional tax system. The agricultural tax rates for the Northeast Administrative Region and the North China Administrative Region are specified in Annex 1; the agricultural tax rates for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shandong Province of the East China Administrative Region, and the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region of the Northwest Administrative Region, shall be drafted separately by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the East China and Northwest Military and Administrative Committees, and implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. In order to further balance the burden capacity of farmers from all strata in the old liberated areas, preparations should be made to switch to a progressive tax system next year. To this end, investigation and research, typical experiments, and all necessary preparatory work should be started this year.

    C. In areas of the late liberated areas that have completed land reform, a unified full progressive tax system should be implemented in 1952, with progressive tax rates ranging from 7% to 30% (no additional taxes are allowed), and the tax rates are specified in Annex 2. All areas of the late liberated areas that have completed land reform shall follow this. In cases with special circumstances, the Military and Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Region may propose adjustments, which shall be implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    D. The tax rates in areas of the late liberated areas that have not yet completed land reform shall be drafted by the Military and Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Region with reference to the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in 1950, and implemented after being submitted to and approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    II. In order to control the planting area of cash crops and appropriately balance the burden on farmers, tax rates on cash crops should be appropriately increased in areas where the burden on cash crops is too light. Except for the method of collecting taxes on cotton fields, for which the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on March 12, 1952, which all localities should follow, the methods of collecting taxes on other cash crops such as tobacco, peanuts, hemp, and sugarcane shall be drafted by the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Regions in accordance with the above principles and the specific conditions of the local areas, and implemented after being approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

    III. The policy of reducing and exempting agricultural taxes is an important part of the agricultural tax policy. In order to implement this policy, governments at all levels must, in their collection work, legally take care of farmers whose harvests are reduced due to disasters, take care of families of martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and families of office workers who are without labor, and the poor farmers who are old, weak, orphaned, widowed, disabled, and take care of the old revolutionary base areas that have suffered particularly severely from war damage and enemy destruction.

    The specific implementation measures for the above-mentioned reductions and exemptions, except for the reduction and exemption measures for disaster-stricken farmers, which shall be drafted by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government and submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and promulgation, shall be drafted by the People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Regions and submitted to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for record.

    IV. In order to stabilize the burden on farmers and enable them to concentrate on production, it is necessary to implement land verification and production determination, calculate and levy taxes according to rates, and reduce or exempt taxes according to law, and verifying land area and assessing output is the basis for implementing calculation and levy of taxes according to rates and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. The People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Regions should continue to guide the People's Governments of their subordinate provinces (cities) to complete the work of land verification and production determination in a planned and led manner in accordance with the "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Verification and Production Determination Work," both to accurately verify the land area and to accurately assess the normal annual output. The assessment of normal annual output should not be too high or too low, and efforts should be made to suit the actual situation. The normal annual output should be fixed after land verification and production determination, which will be more conducive to encouraging farmers to boldly develop production.

    V. In order to tighten the procedures for agricultural tax calculation and collection and plug loopholes for corruption and waste, the organizational work of collection operations should be strengthened. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government should promptly formulate and promulgate the "General Rules for Agricultural Tax Collection Operations." The People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) of the Greater Administrative Regions must, in accordance with the provisions of the General Rules, guide the People's Governments of their subordinate provinces (cities) to effectively improve the agricultural tax collection operations, strengthen the organization of grain transportation into warehouses, prevent waste of manpower and materials and casualties of people and animals, ensure the specifications of grain and cash crops entering warehouses, promptly clear up arrears, and improve the reporting system.

    VI. Governments at all levels should strengthen the policy education and business education of agricultural tax collectors, so that they can learn the specific methods of land verification and production determination, calculating and levying taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law. When the collection season arrives, the heads of governments and financial departments at all levels must personally go to the countryside to personally lead this work; and joint inspection teams should be organized by the financial, civil affairs, agricultural and other relevant departments to go deep into various places to conduct inspections. Whether the agricultural tax work is done well should be based on whether the "land verification and production determination, calculating and levying taxes according to rates, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law" are implemented. Those who have achieved excellent results should be commended, those who have deviations should be corrected in time, and those whose circumstances are serious should be punished. In addition, the Military and Administrative Committees of the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South Greater Administrative Regions should also strengthen the investigation and research and guidance on the burden on farmers and animal husbandry tax work in ethnic minority areas.

Annex 2: Tax Rates for Areas of Late Liberated Areas that Have Completed Land Reform

Annex 1: Tax Rates for Old Liberated Areas

    A. Northeast Region: Adopting a proportional tax system without a tax-free amount, the tax rates are as follows:

    B. North China Region:
    Adopting a proportional tax system with a tax-free amount, deduct a tax-free amount of one standard mu (land producing one shi of grain) per agricultural population, and the remaining taxable standard mu is the burden mu, and each burden mu is levied 22 jin of millet. The calculation formula is as follows: (Total standard mu of the family - 1 standard mu × total agricultural population of the family) × 22 jin = total tax payable by the family (jin, millet).

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示
    一九五二年农业税收的总方针是：贯彻查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，逐步实现统一累进，并取消一切附加。兹根据这一方针，对一九五二年农业税收工作发出如下指示：
    一、一九五二年农业税的税制、税率，依照下列规定执行。
    甲、全国各地农业税的地方附加，一律取消。今后对农业只由中央统一征收一道农业税，不再附加。
    乙、一九五二年老解放区暂仍采行比例税制。东北大行政区和华北大行政区的农业税率规定如附表一；内蒙古自治区及华东大行政区的山东省、西北大行政区的前陕甘宁边区的农业税率，分别由内蒙古自治区人民政府及华东、西北军政委员会拟订，报经中央人民政府政务院批准后施行。为了更进一步地平衡老解放区各阶层农民的负担能力，应准备在明年改行累进税制。为此，今年即应着手做好调查研究、典型试验和各项必要的准备工作。
    丙、晚解放区已经完成土地改革的地区，一九五二年应施行统一全额累进税制，累进税率从百分之七起到百分之三十止（一律不准再征附加税），税率规定如附表二。凡晚解放区已经完成土地改革的地区，均应照此执行。其有特殊情况者，得由大行政区军政委员会提出调整方案，报经中央人民政府政务院批准后施行。
    丁、晚解放区尚未完成土地改革的地区的税率，由大行政区军政委员会参照一九五○年中央人民政府公布的“新解放区农业税暂行条例”拟订，报经中央人民政府政务院批准后施行。
    二、为了控制经济作物的种植面积，并适当平衡农民负担，凡经济作物负担过轻的地区，均应酌情提高经济作物的税率。除棉田征收办法，已由中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于一九五二年三月十二日发布关于棉田负担的指示，各地应依照执行外，其他经济作物如烟叶、花生、麻、甘蔗等征收办法，由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）根据上述原则与当地具体情况斟酌拟订，报经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会核准施行。
    三、农业税中的减免政策，是农业税收政策中的重要组成部分。为了贯彻这一政策，各级人民政府在征收工作中，必须依法照顾因灾歉收的农户，照顾烈士家属、革命军人家属、机关工作人员家属中而无劳力的农户和老、弱、孤、寡、残疾的贫苦农户，照顾遭受战争创伤和敌人摧残特别深重的革命老根据地。
    上述各项减免，除受灾农户的减免办法，由中央人民政府财政部拟订报中央人民政府政务院批准公布外，其具体实施办法均由大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）自行拟订报中央人民政府政务院备案。
    四、为了稳定农民负担，使农民安心生产，就必须实行查田定产，依率计征，依法减免，而查实田亩，核定产量又是贯彻依率计征、依法减免的基础。各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）应依照“农业税查田定产工作实施纲要”，继续指导所属各省（市）人民政府有领导、有计划地全部完成查田定产工作，既要确实查清田亩，又要确实核定常年应产量。常年应产量的核定，不能偏高也不能偏低，力求适合实际。常年应产量在查田定产后应固定下来，这样对奖励农民放手发展生产会更为有利。
    五、为严密农业税计征手续，堵塞贪污浪费的漏洞，应加强征收业务的组织工作。中央人民政府财政部应迅速制定公布“农业税征收业务通则”。各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）须依照通则的规定，指导所属各省（市）人民政府切实改进农业税的征收业务，加强运粮入仓的组织性，防止对人力、物力的浪费和人畜伤亡现象，保证入仓粮食和经济作物的规格，及时清理尾欠，并健全解报制度。
    六、各级人民政府应加强对农业税征收人员的政策教育和业务教育，使他们学会查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的具体做法。在征收季节到来时，各级人民政府和财政部门首长，必须亲自下乡亲自领导这一工作；并由财政、民政、农业等有关部门组织联合检查组，深入各地进行检查，检查农业税工作是否做得好，应以是否贯彻“查田定产、依率计征、依法减免”为标准，其成绩优良者予以表扬，发生偏差者应及时纠正，对情节严重者，并应给以处分。此外，西北、西南、中南三大行政区军政委员会并应加强对少数民族地区中农民负担和牧税工作的调查研究和指导。
