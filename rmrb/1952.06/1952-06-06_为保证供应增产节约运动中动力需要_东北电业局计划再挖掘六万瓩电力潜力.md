Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th -- To guarantee the supply of a large amount of electricity needed by various industrial and mining enterprises in this year's Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the Northeast Electric Power Administration has promptly formulated concrete measures and plans to increase power. This is one of the main contents of the bureau's Increase Production and Practice Economy plan for this year. In addition to ensuring the realization of the state plan, this plan requires that the potential of 60,000 kilowatts of power be further tapped on the existing basis, which is equivalent to increasing power generation equipment capable of generating 80,000 kilowatts for the state. Since the beginning of this year, based on the experience of a sudden increase in electricity consumption by various industrial and mining enterprises after the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement last year, the bureau has conducted specific investigations and studies on the equipment conditions and various advanced experiences in production of its affiliated electric power bureaus and power plants, and then formulated specific measures and plans to increase power. According to this plan, the Northeast Electric Power Industry will vigorously promote advanced experiences such as adjusting loads, rapid overhauls, and unified overhauls between power companies and industrial and mining enterprises this year. After the promotion of these experiences, at least more than 30,000 kilowatts of power can be added. In addition, it is planned to improve certain equipment devices and carry out technical improvements during overhauls; it is planned to install previously idle electrostatic accumulators in the power distribution and transmission system; and on the user side, it is planned to carry out a region-wide campaign to save non-industrial electricity consumption. Through these measures, the Northeast Electric Power Industry can also increase more than 30,000 kilowatts of power.
    Now, employees of local electric power bureaus and power plants have taken action to realize this plan of action. In terms of promoting advanced experiences, the Northeast Electric Power Administration organized electrical and boiler maintenance personnel from various electric power bureaus and power plants in May to conduct on-site learning of the experience of rapid overhaul of boilers and transformer equipment in Fushun and Dalian respectively. When overhauling ultra-high-voltage lines in mid-May, employees of the Anshan Electric Power Bureau used the rapid overhaul method, which increased efficiency by two times compared to the past, thereby increasing the production time of industrial and mining enterprises. The number of units adopting the unified overhaul of power companies and industrial and mining enterprises has increased from three to seven. In terms of retrofitting equipment, the Dalian Electric Power Bureau has completed more than one-half of the installation of electrostatic accumulators to date. In order to make the motor capacity and mechanical equipment load used by various industries and mines consistent, so as to improve power efficiency, local power bureaus have sent people to various industrial and mining enterprises to check the condition of motors and mechanical equipment for appropriate adjustments. Certain technical improvements are also being implemented in various places.

    为保证供应增产节约运动中动力需要
    东北电业局计划再挖掘六万瓩电力潜力
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北电业管理局为保证供应各工矿企业今年增产节约运动中需要的大量电力，已及时制订出增加电力的具体措施计划，这是该局今年增产节约计划的主要内容之一。这一计划除保证实现国家计划外，要求在现有的基础上再挖掘六万瓩的电力的潜在力量，相当于给国家增加能发八万瓩电力的发电设备。该局从今年年初以来，即根据去年增产节约运动开展后各工矿企业用电突增的经验，对所属各电业局及发电厂的设备情况与生产中的各种先进经验做了具体的调查研究，才订出了增加电力的具体措施计划。根据这一计划，东北电力工业今年将大力推广调整负荷、快速检修、电业与工矿企业统一检修等先进经验。这些经验推广后，至少可增加三万多瓩电力。另外，在检修中计划改善某些设备装置，并进行技术上的改进；在配、送电系统计划安设过去闲置的静电蓄电器；在用户方面计划开展全区范围的节约非工业用电运动。通过这些措施东北电力工业也可增加三万瓩以上的电力。
    现在各地电业局和发电厂职工为实现这一措施计划，已纷纷行动起来。在推广先进经验方面，东北电业管理局已在五月组织了各电业局和发电厂的电气、锅炉检修人员，分别在抚顺、大连两地实地学习了快速检修锅炉、变电设备的经验。鞍山电业局职工在五月中间检修超高压线路时运用了快速检修法，效率比过去提高两倍，从而增加了工矿企业的生产时间。采用电业与工矿企业统一检修的单位，已由三个增加到七个。在改装设备方面，大连电业局到目前止已把静电蓄电器装完二分之一以上。为使各工矿用的电动机容量和机械设备负荷一致，以提高电力效率，各地电业局已派人到各工矿企业检查电动机和机械设备情况，以便进行适当的调整。某些技术上的改进，各地也正在实施中。
