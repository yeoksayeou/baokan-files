Give New China's Children More and Better Reading Materials
    He Yi

    Cultivating and educating the younger generation of children, and enabling them to grow into builders and defenders of the motherland's future, is a major task. Children's literature is one of the powerful tools we use to accomplish this task. However, many of the current children's books still have some shortcomings. These shortcomings weaken the educational effect of the works.

    In many children's books, the author's lack of correct assessment of children's abilities and cognitive levels is evident. Today's children, under the education of the Party and the People's Government, and influenced and inspired by all the new things in New China, already know more about our world, our country, our people, and our surroundings than children of any previous era. Their desire to become familiar with and understand new things is also more urgent. They demand that writers tell them these things clearly, plainly, and in detail. But the authors of our children's books have not recognized this, seeing them as "ignorant little kids." They say: "Some things cannot be explained clearly to children no matter how you try. You must use a different approach to talk to them."

    What is this so-called "different approach"? It is the indiscriminate use of the "fable" form, it is symbolism and innuendo, it is explicit and implicit metaphors. They think that adopting this "approach" can provide more inspiration to children, and that children can be more interested and easily accept it when reading. For example, stories with the theme of resisting America and aiding Korea are originally very concrete and vivid materials for conducting patriotism and internationalism education for children; but some authors believe that writing about war and related life exceeds children's life experiences, and therefore cannot be accepted by children. Therefore, when they write about this aspect, they often use the so-called "symbolic" technique, using fierce beasts such as tigers or lions, wolves, etc. to represent the aggressors, and weak animals such as deer or sheep, rabbits, etc. to represent lovers of peace, and the ending is always that deer, sheep, rabbits, and other "peace-loving" animals, after suffering losses, unite closely and repel tigers or lions, wolves, etc.; or, they write about a fire in the neighborhood, the eldest brother sits by and does not help, resulting in collateral damage, the second brother puts out the fire, thus preserving the neighbor and himself, and so on.

    Some of our children's literature authors put aside the living people and living things and do not write about them, but fabricate a set of far-fetched "bird and beast languages," thinking that this is simple and vivid, but the result is that the works appear particularly empty and mysterious, even nondescript, making the young readers guess for a long time without understanding what the author is trying to tell them.

    Belonging to the same nature, there is another phenomenon, that is, when writing for children, the authors deliberately act "naively," filling the paper with "Ah! Yah! Ne! La!" self-satisfiedly creating some "children's language," acting pretentiously and awkwardly. And ordinary young readers lightly believe in the "writer's" talent, regard it as a model, and accept some bad influences in terms of rhetoric, sentence construction, etc. All of the above situations are obviously due to underestimating the children's abilities and cognitive levels.

    Contrary to the above situation, some authors completely ignore the characteristics of children and their ability to accept, writing children's books that are no different from general adult books. Even in terms of proposition, theme, structure, sentence construction, etc., they are even more rough, careless, stiff, and obscure, with dogmatism and slogans everywhere, making children readers feel bored.

    What's even worse is that some authors excessively emphasize the power of children in their works. This unrealistic description shows that some authors still retain some "child-centered" ideas. They believe that children can carry out independent activities and struggles without any leadership or support from any force. For example, in some stories depicting the struggle against the Japanese puppets in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the War of Liberation, the child protagonists are written as small heroes who come and go alone, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. In the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, children are written as small Sherlock Holmes who have deeply mastered the essence of detective techniques. Neglecting the characteristic that children are not yet mature in terms of physiology, age, politics, and cultural cultivation, and emphasizing their independence in political and social activities are both inconsistent with facts and educational principles. Because the result of such emphasis weakens the authenticity of the work, thus making the protagonists in the eyes of young readers become mysterious and unattainable legendary figures, and may even cause general child readers to encounter unexpected problems in imitating these "little heroes."

    Children are willing to understand and become familiar with some small heroes who are similar in age, similar in situation, and even have similar shortcomings and advantages to them. They are willing to understand and become familiar with: some heroes who live around them, in their motherland, and in their world. They are willing to understand and become familiar with: the increasingly beautiful cities, rural areas, forests, mines, rivers, and mountains that are changing significantly around them, as well as the increasingly happy people. They are even more willing to understand and become familiar with: the stories of the Party that has brought them light and happiness, as well as the great leader and his comrades. But in all these aspects, many of our authors have done very little and very poorly. Children often write letters to their newspapers and magazines to express their demands, they complain that writers are not concerned enough about children, and that the things they write are too few and too far away from them. This is not without reason.

    Indeed, many children's writers are far from the lives of children. They are not familiar with the lives and thoughts of today's children, and they do not have enough understanding of the growing character and moral character of the new generation. Therefore, they cannot resonate with children in terms of thoughts and feelings. The children they write speak the words of adults and do the things of adults. Even, the children's lives they write about are still the lives of the authors' own childhoods. They use their own memories to speculate on the current children's lives, so the children's readers often feel unfamiliar and untrue when they read what they write.

    In writing about all new things, many authors of children's books also do a very poor job. They "convey" communications and news from the newspapers to the children. Without processing or modification, they simply change long sentences into short sentences and long articles into short articles. Such reading materials are naturally not deeply touching, and children cannot possibly like them.

    In addition, in terms of science and other knowledge children's books that cooperate with school courses, the authors also write very little. The quality is not satisfactory, and there is a common problem (with very few exceptions), that is, there is only a pile of knowledge, not enough "childlike"; the materials are generally stiff and boring, children are not easy to digest, and even simply do not want to read. In this way, the majority of children lack the necessary auxiliary tools in expanding and deepening the study of classroom knowledge.

    The reason why these shortcomings have not been corrected for a long time is mainly because society has not paid enough attention to children's books; the publishing and reading circles have not launched criticism of children's books; some authors of children's books have a tendency to deviate from politics and deviate from life, lack keen sensitivity to new things, have not well grasped the Party's education policy, have not deeply studied their work and business, and have not fully used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to achieve mutual unity and improvement among themselves.

    The authors of our children's books should recognize the great role that children's books play in children's education, and recognize the great responsibility they shoulder in cultivating and educating the young generation of New China. First of all, they must establish a serious attitude of being responsible to the people and to children, strive to study, improve their political and professional levels, closely connect with children, understand and recognize the characteristics and specific circumstances of children, closely combine with children in terms of thoughts and feelings, and resolutely struggle to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party and the people. Teachers, parents, writers, and scholars across the country should also care more about children's books for the happiness of children, constantly offer opinions and criticisms on children's books, and should also allocate some time as much as possible to write for children, so that the children of New China can obtain more and better reading materials.

    给新中国的儿童更多更好的读物
    贺宜
    培养和教育少年儿童一代，使他们成长为祖国未来的建设者和保卫者，是一个重大的任务。儿童读物就是我们用以完成这一任务的有力工具之一。但是，目前不少的儿童读物还有一些缺点。这些缺点削弱了作品的教育效果。
    在很多儿童读物中，表现着作者对儿童的能力和认识水平缺乏正确的估计。今天的少年儿童，在党和人民政府的教养下，在新中国的一切新鲜事物的影响和启迪下，已经比过去任何一个时代的儿童们对我们的世界，我们的国家，我们的人民，我们的周围，知道得更多，他们对熟悉和了解新事物的要求也更加迫切。他们要求作家们明明白白地、完整详尽地把这些告诉他们。可是我们的儿童读物的作者却没有认识到这一点，把他们看成是“不知天高地厚的娃娃”。他们说：“有些事对小孩子是怎样讲也讲不清楚的。必须换一种方式跟他们讲。”
    他们所谓“换一种方式”是什么呢？这就是乱用“寓言”这一形式，就是象征影射，就是明譬暗喻。他们以为采用这种“方式”，可以对儿童多所启发，而且孩子们阅读时可以更感兴趣，容易接受。例如以抗美援朝为主题的故事，本来是向儿童进行爱国主义和国际主义教育很具体生动的材料；但有些作者却以为写战争和有关的生活，是超越儿童生活经验的，因而也是儿童们所不能接受的。所以，他们一写到这方面，往往就运用所谓“象征”手法，拿老虎或狮子、狼等猛兽来代表侵略者，拿鹿或羊、兔等软弱的动物来代表和平的爱好者，而收场总是在鹿、羊、兔等“爱好和平”的动物一度吃亏之后，紧密地团结起来，打退了老虎或狮子、狼等；或则，他们写隔邻失火，老大坐视不救致遭池鱼之殃，老二救火，因而保全了邻人也保全了自己，等等。
    我们有些儿童读物的作者，把活生生的人，活生生的事丢在一边不写，却杜撰一套牵强附会的“鸟言兽语”，自以为这样又简单又生动，结果却是使作品显得格外空洞玄虚，甚至弄得不伦不类，叫小读者猜了半天，还不懂作者到底在告诉他什么。
    同属于这一种性质的，还有另一种现象，那就是作者为孩子们写作时，故意做出“老天真”的样子，满纸“啊！呀！呢！啦！”自鸣得意地创造了一些“儿童口语”，装腔作势，扭扭捏捏。而一般小读者又轻信“作家”的才藻，奉为典范，在修辞、造句等等方面，接受了一些坏的影响。以上这些情形，显然都是对儿童能力和认识水平估计不足的缘故。
    和上述情况相反，有些作者完全忽视儿童的特点和他们的接受能力，把儿童读物写得跟一般成人读物没有什么区别。甚至在命题、立意、结构、造句等等方面，还要更加粗糙、马虎、生硬、晦涩，以至教条满目，口号连篇，使儿童读者们感到意兴索然。
    更不好的是，有些作者在作品里面过分强调儿童的力量。这种不合乎事实的描写，说明有些作者多少还残存着“儿童本位”思想。他们以为儿童在没有任何领导和任何力量支持的条件下，一样可以进行独立的活动和斗争。例如在描写抗日战争的对日伪斗争和在解放战争的对蒋匪军斗争的一些故事中，儿童主人翁被写成独往独来，神出鬼没的小英雄。在镇压反革命运动中，则把儿童写成了深得侦缉术三昧的小福尔摩斯。忽视了儿童不论在生理、年龄、政治及文化修养上尚未成熟的这一个特点，强调他们在政治和社会活动方面的独立性，都是既不合事实又不合教育原则的。因为这样强调的结果，使作品的真实性减弱了，因而也使作品中的主人翁，在小读者眼中成为神秘的，不可企及的传奇人物，甚至可能引起一般儿童读者在仿效这些“小英雄”的实践中，发生意外的问题。
    儿童愿意了解和熟悉一些跟他们年龄相仿，处境相仿、甚至有和他们的缺点优点相类同的小英雄。他们愿意了解和熟悉：一些生活在他们的周围、他们的祖国和他们的世界上的英雄们。他们愿意了解和熟悉：在他们周围正在显著变化着的越来越美丽的城市、农村、森林、矿场、河流、山岭以及越过越幸福的人民。他们更愿意了解和熟悉：给他们带来了光明和幸福的党以及伟大的领袖和他的战友们的故事。但是在所有这些方面，我们的许多作者是做得很少、很差的。儿童们常常给自己的报纸和刊物写信提出他们的要求，他们抱怨作家对儿童们不够关切，写的东西太少，而且离他们很远。这不是没有理由的。
    的确，许多儿童作家离儿童的生活很远。他们不熟悉今天儿童的生活、思想，他们对新的一代的性格和品德的日渐长成没有足够了解。因此他们在思想感情上不能和儿童共鸣。他们所写的儿童，说着大人的话，做着大人的事。甚至，他们写的儿童生活，还是作者自己童年时代的生活。他们用回忆自己去揣想现在的儿童生活，因此他们所写出来的，儿童读者们看了，常感不亲切、不真实。
    在写一切新事物方面，有许多儿童读物的作者做得也很拙劣。他们把报上的通讯和新闻给儿童们做“传达”。既无加工，又少修饰，不过把长句改短句，长文改短文而已。这样的读物自然感人不深，儿童们也不可能喜爱的。
    此外，在配合学校正课学习的科学和其他知识的儿童读物方面，作者们也写得很少。质量不够使人满意，而且有一个通病（很少是例外的），那就是只有知识的堆砌，不够“儿童化”；材料一般都生硬枯燥，儿童不易消化，甚至根本就不愿看。这样，就使广大儿童在扩大和加深课堂知识的学习上，缺少了必要的辅佐的工具。
    上面这些缺点之所以长期没有纠正，主要是由于社会对儿童读物还没有给予足够的注意；出版界读书界对儿童读物的批评也没有展开；一些儿童读物的作者有脱离政治和脱离生活的倾向，对新鲜事物缺乏锐敏感觉，对党的教育政策也没有很好掌握，对工作和业务没有深入钻研，在彼此之间也没有充分运用批评和自我批评的武器来达到相互团结和提高的目的。
    我们儿童读物的作者应该认识到儿童读物在儿童教育工作上起的巨大作用，认识到自己所肩负的培养教育新中国幼年一代的责任之重大。首先要树立为人民和为儿童负责的严肃态度，努力学习，提高自己的政治水平和业务水平，密切联系儿童，了解和认识儿童的特点和具体情况，在思想感情上和儿童密切结合，坚决为完成党和人民所赋予的光荣任务而斗争。全国的教师、父母、作家和学者们也要为了儿童的幸福而更多地关心儿童读物，经常对儿童读物提出意见和批评，而且自己也应该尽可能分出一些时间来给儿童写作，使新中国的儿童们能够获得更多更好的读物。
