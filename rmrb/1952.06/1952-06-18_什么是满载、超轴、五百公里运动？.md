    What are the Full Load, Over-Axle, and Five Hundred Kilometer Movements?
    Question: What are the so-called full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements?
    Answer: The full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movements are concrete actions taken by railway employees in response to Chairman Mao’s great call for "increase production and practice economy." The content of this movement, simply put, is to load fully, haul more, and run faster.
    (1) Full Load: Railway freight cars have certain standards for the weight and volume of goods they carry. There are many types of freight cars, including flat cars, open cars, boxcars, tank cars, etc. There are even more types of goods, which can be roughly divided into two types: heavy goods and light goods. Therefore, the meaning of "full load" is to improve the loading and packaging methods of various goods, so that various freight cars can load as much cargo as possible within the standard load.
    (2) Over-Axle: The total weight of vehicles pulled by a locomotive also has a certain standard, which varies depending on the line conditions and the type of locomotive. If the operating skills of the crew are improved, the maintenance of the locomotive is done well, and the organization and planning of scheduling work are strengthened, then the weight pulled by the locomotive can be increased. If the weight pulled exceeds the prescribed standard by eight percent, it is called "over-axle."
    (3) Five Hundred Kilometers: A locomotive traveling five hundred kilometers in a day and night is called five hundred-day car kilometers. The purpose of the five hundred-day car kilometer movement is to accelerate vehicle operation and increase transport capacity. However, five hundred-day car kilometers is a general goal, and the number of daily car kilometers can be increased or decreased in various places due to different line and equipment conditions. For example, some areas require locomotive crew groups to travel seven hundred kilometers per day and night to be considered participants in the five hundred-kilometer movement; some areas require locomotive crew groups to travel just over four hundred kilometers in a day and night to earn the title of five hundred-kilometer movement participant.
    The full load, over-axle, and five hundred-kilometer movements are initiated by advanced railway workers under the leadership of the Party, who actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and received the help of Soviet experts. In August 1949, the Zheng Xikun youth locomotive crew group of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway began to implement over-axle traction. With the encouragement and assistance of Soviet Section Chief Valolamov and Soviet expert Golimink, the group learned advanced Soviet operating methods and continuously created new over-axle records. In June 1950, Wang Jikui and Qiao Yuyan, drivers of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway, created a record of five hundred-day car kilometers with the help of Soviet expert Malikiyanov (during the rule of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, the daily car kilometers of locomotives was only two to three hundred kilometers). In July 1950, Yang Maolin, the chief weighman of the Harbin Station of the China Changchun Railway, learned from advanced Soviet experience and increased the loading capacity of less-than-carload freight from sixteen to seventeen tons to twenty-six to twenty-seven tons, creating a new record for full load. In the process of the movement's development, many advanced workers have begun to combine full load, over-axle, and five hundred-kilometer operations, making them a complete and unified revolutionary competition movement. Now, this movement is being carried out enthusiastically among railway employees throughout the country.

### 什么是满载、超轴、五百公里运动？

    什么是满载、超轴、五百公里运动？
    问：什么叫满载、超轴、五百公里运动？
    答：满载、超轴、五百公里运动，是铁路员工响应毛主席“增产节约”的伟大号召的具体行动。这
    一运动的内容，简单地说来，就是装得满，拉得多，跑得快。
    （一）满载：铁路上的货车，装载货物的重量和容量，是有一定标准的。货车的种类很多，有平板车、敞车、棚车、油槽车等等，货物的种类更是繁多，大体说来，可分笨重货物和轻浮货物两种。因此，满载的意思，就是改善各种货物的装载方法和包装方法，使各种货车在载重的标准之内，尽可能的多装货物。
    （二）超轴：机车牵引车辆的总重量，由于线路条件和机车类型的不同，也有一定的标准。如果提高乘务员的操作技术，做好机车保养工作，加强调度工作的组织性和计划性，那末，机车牵引的重量，是可以增加的。如果牵引的重量超过规定标准的百分之八，就叫做超轴。
    （三）五百公里：一个机车在一昼夜内行驶五百公里，叫做五百日车公里。五百日车公里运动的目的，在于加速车辆运行，提高运输能力。但五百日车公里是一般的奋斗目标，由于线路、设备等条件不同，各地的日车公里数可以有所增减。如：有些地区的机车包乘组，每昼夜行驶七百公里，才算做五百公里运动者；有些地区的机车包乘组，在一昼夜走行四百多公里，也可获得五百公里运动者的称号。
    满载、超轴、五百公里运动，是先进的铁路工人，在党的领导下，积极地学习了苏联的先进经验，并得到苏联专家的帮助而发动起来的。一九四九年八月，中长路苏家屯机务段郑锡坤青年包车组，开始实行超轴牵引。该组在苏联段长瓦洛拉莫夫和苏联专家哥立明克的鼓励、帮助下，学习苏联先进操纵方法，连续创造了超轴新纪录。一九五○年六月，中长路昂昂溪机务段司机王吉奎、乔玉岩在苏联专家马力基雅诺夫帮助下，创造了五百日车公里的纪录（在日伪和国民党统治时，机车的日车公里只有二、三百公里）。一九五○年七月，中长路哈尔滨车站主任司磅员杨茂林学习了苏联先进经验，把零担货物装载量，从十六、七吨提高到二十六、七吨，创造了满载新纪录。在运动发展过程中，许多先进工作者已开始把满载、超轴、五百公里运行结合起来，使之成为一个完整的统一的革命竞赛运动。现在，这个运动正在全国铁路职工中热烈地开展着。
