Introducing Several Methods for Eliminating Pine Caterpillars

Editor: Last year, in 25 villages at the border of Jing County and Xuan City in Anhui's Wuhu Prefecture, pine caterpillars damaged pine trees. Local leaders mobilized 99,000 people to catch over 60,000 jin of caterpillars. Since the beginning of spring this year, this pest has spread to 50 villages in Jing County, Xuan City, and Nanling County. In severely affected areas, each tree has as many as 200 caterpillars, and generally 50 to 60. This insect is extremely poisonous. Most of the pine trees damaged last year have withered, looking as if they were burned, causing significant losses. This year, the prefectural and county governments have learned from last year's experience and are paying close attention to the work of eliminating pine caterpillars, establishing a pine caterpillar control headquarters in Wuhu Prefecture and mobilizing the masses to eliminate the pine caterpillar infestation. From May 12th to June 2nd, nearly 40,000 people were mobilized in 50 villages, eliminating more than 56,000 jin of pine caterpillars, ensuring the survival of the pine forests. The masses are continuing to capture them.

The masses have gained the following experiences in the caterpillar catching campaign: (1) The larvae are poisonous, and contact with human skin causes redness and swelling. When beating the insects, vigorously knock the trees with wooden mallets to shake the insects off. When picking up the insects, use iron shears or bamboo clips to pick them up and put them into tin cans or earthenware to eliminate them. (2) After this insect forms a cocoon, it is inconvenient to pick them from the high trees, so a wire comb can be tied to the top of a bamboo pole to comb down the cocoons. Some tie iron shears to the bamboo tip or sharpen the bamboo tip into a knife shape to cut the cocoons. (3) After this insect turns into a moth, it is easy to catch them in the early morning, evening, after rain, or during mating. (4) The egg masses of this insect are deeply hidden in the leaves and are not easily seen, but as long as you face the pine needles with your back to the sunlight, you can find them. Once discovered, cut off the pine needles together and burn them.

    介绍扑灭松毛虫的几种办法
    编辑同志：去年在安徽芜湖专区的泾县、宣城交界处有二十五个村发生松毛虫为害松树。那里的领导方面曾动员群众九万九千人，捕虫六万多斤。今年入春以来，这种害虫竟蔓延到泾县、宣城、南陵等三个县的五十个村。严重的地区每棵树上长有二百条害虫，一般的也有五六十条。这种虫毒害无比，去年遭虫危害的松树，大部都枯萎了，好像火烧过一样，损失很重。今年专署及县区政府接受去年教训，对扑灭松毛虫工作已经很重视，成立了芜湖专区扑虫指挥所，发动群众消灭松毛虫害。从五月十二日到六月二日，五十个村动员了近四万群众，捕灭了松毛虫五万六千多斤，保证了松林的成活。现在群众还在继续捕捉中。
    群众在捕虫运动中得到以下几点经验：（一）幼虫有毒，触人皮肤要红肿。在打虫时，用木槌猛力敲树，使虫震落。拾虫时，可用铁剪或竹夹等拾起装到洋铁筒或瓦器中扑灭。（二）这种虫成茧以后，因树高取摘不便，可用一种铁丝梳，绑在竹杆顶上，梳下虫茧。有的把铁剪绑在竹梢上或把竹梢削成刀状，用以削茧。（三）这种虫变蛾后，在早、晚、雨后或交媾时，容易捕捉。（四）这种虫卵块深藏叶中，不易看见，但只要背着太阳光，面对着松针就能找到，发现后要连松毛一起削下烧灭。余正荣    张文泉
