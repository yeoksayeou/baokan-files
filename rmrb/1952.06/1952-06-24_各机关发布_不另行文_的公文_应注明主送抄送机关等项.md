    Government Agencies Issuing "Not to be Separately Circulated" Official Documents Should Indicate the Main Recipient and Copied Agencies, etc.
    To the Editor: I often see notices, circulars, instructions, bulletins, decisions, and other documents published by various government agencies in newspapers and periodicals. Some of these official documents are marked with the words "Not to be Separately Circulated" at the end. According to Article 19 of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Official Documents" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, when encountering such official documents, relevant agencies should handle them as incoming documents and file them. However, because these official documents do not have the names of the receiving agencies, it is very inconvenient to handle them. This is because some official documents are to be handled or implemented by various industrial and mining enterprises; some are to be handled or implemented by government agencies. There are also distinctions within the government: for example, some official documents are to be handled by the people's governments of provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, then the cities and counties under the provinces will not handle them; some official documents are to be handled by the people's governments of counties, districts, and villages, then the municipal people's government will not handle them. At the same time, because these official documents do not have document numbers, it is also difficult in terms of archival management and file retrieval. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, when local authorities and government agencies publish "Not to be Separately Circulated" official documents in newspapers and periodicals, they must indicate the document number and the main recipient and copied agencies so that relevant units can implement and handle them.

### 各机关发布“不另行文”的公文  应注明主送抄送机关等项

    各机关发布“不另行文”的公文
    应注明主送抄送机关等项
    编辑同志：我常在报刊上看见一些机关公布的通知、通令、指示、通报、决定等文件。其中有些公文在文尾注明了“不另行文”的字样。根据中央人民政府政务院颁布的“公文处理暂行办法”第十九条规定，遇有这样的公文，有关机关一律按来文处理，并剪、录归档。但是，由于这些公文没有受文机关名称，处理起来很不方便。因为有的公文是属于各工矿企业部门处理或执行的；有的是属于政府机关处理或执行的。政府还有区别：如有的公文是属于省、大行政区直辖市人民政府处理的，则省属市、县便不处理；有的公文是属于县、区、村人民政府处理的，市人民政府便不处理。同时，由于这些公文没有字号，在档案管理、查卷方面也感到困难。因此，我建议：今后各地各机关在报刊上发布“不另行文”的公文时，务必注明字号和主送、抄送机关，以便有关单位执行办理。
