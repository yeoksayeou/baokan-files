    Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Plant
    Self-Criticism for Not Valuing Liu Qingxiang's Invention
    To the Editor:
    After reading the reader's letter published in the People's Daily on May 19th criticizing our plant for not valuing the coiling machine invented by labor model Liu Qingxiang, we immediately conducted a review.

    Liu Qingxiang's preliminary design for the coiling machine was submitted to us in February of last year. At that time, the plant was manufacturing five or six new products, and rework and waste were frequent occurrences. Under these circumstances, we wrongly decided to postpone the trial production of the coiling machine and, even more wrongly, returned the original design to Comrade Liu Qingxiang for safekeeping. Comrade Liu Qingxiang's invention was thus shelved for a long period. Our approach was wrong. Even if our plant was indeed unable to produce the coiling machine, we should have forwarded the design to higher authorities or relevant departments. But we did not do so. This erroneous thinking of ours, not valuing the creativity of the masses, seriously hindered the development of the working class's creativity. We are determined to learn from this lesson and correct our mistakes. In addition to making a self-criticism to all employees, we are now mobilizing all employees to conduct a review regarding the development of the rationalization proposal movement, and we plan to reward employees who have made achievements in invention and creation.

### 济南第二机器厂  对不重视刘庆祥创造的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    济南第二机器厂
    对不重视刘庆祥创造的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十九日刊载读者来信，批评我厂不重视劳动模范刘庆祥创造的卷筒机。我们看了这一批评，当即作了检查。
    刘庆祥同志研究的卷筒机的初步图案，是去年二月交给我们的。当时厂里新制产品有五、六种，常常发生返工浪费现象；在这种情况下，我们错误地决定了暂缓试造卷筒机，更错误地把原图案交回刘庆祥同志保存。刘庆祥同志的创造就此长期被搁置起来。我们这种作法是错误的。这种卷筒机，即使我厂确实不能试造，我们也应当把图案转交给上级或有关部门。但我们没有这样做。我们这种不重视群众创造的错误思想，严重地阻碍了工人阶级创造性的发挥。我们决心接受这次教训，改正错误。我们除向全体职工作检讨外，现在正发动全厂职工进行一次关于开展合理化建议运动的检查，并拟对在创造、发明方面有成绩的职工加以奖励。
