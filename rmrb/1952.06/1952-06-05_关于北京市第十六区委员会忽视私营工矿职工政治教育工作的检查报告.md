    Inspection Report on the Neglect of Political Education for Employees in Private Industrial and Mining Enterprises by the 16th District Committee of Beijing Municipality
    Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published reader Ma Ning's criticism of the Jingxi Mentougou local party committee's lack of attention to workers' education on April 18th, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately sent two cadres to Jingxi Mentougou to assist the 16th District Committee in conducting an inspection, and formulated a short-term political education plan for workers. The results of the inspection by the Beijing Municipal Committee Propaganda Department and the 16th District Committee, as well as opinions on strengthening workers' education in the future, are published as follows:
I.
    The total population of the 16th District of Beijing is 78,300, of which 56,600 are permanent residents. Among the permanent residents, 32,700 are non-agricultural, accounting for more than 57% of the total permanent residents in the district. According to statistics, there are currently more than 18,000 workers in private coal kilns in the district (including more than 8,000 fixed workers and more than 10,000 mobile workers), scattered in 124 small kilns. The mobile workers are all disaster victims from Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar provinces, and some farmers from the nearby counties of Mentougou who work during their agricultural off-season (the main source of income for these people is wages earned from working). In addition, there are more than 7,000 workers in industries such as shop assistants, construction, transportation, and handicrafts. This shows that industrial production accounts for a large proportion in this area, and therefore, attaching importance to the political work of workers is a major task of the local party committee.
    The Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union, under the leadership of the 16th District Committee, directly leads the trade union work of state-owned and public-owned mechanized mines, and its affiliated Private Enterprise Working Committee leads the trade union work of private small kilns. There are currently more than 9,100 trade union members in private small kilns. There are currently only 49 Communist Party members among private miners, scattered in street branches, and no party groups have been established based on production enterprises. Therefore, a core of party leadership has not been formed among the workers. In addition, there are more than 4,600 trade union members (including shop assistants) under the leadership of the 16th District Trade Union Office, who also urgently need to be educated.
    However, for more than two years, the Private Enterprise Working Committee of the Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union has not done enough in the political education of employees. Although the trade union has held four training classes for cadres, only 1,000 workers have participated in the training, and the content of the study was only the Trade Union Law, Labor Protection Regulations, Labor-Capital Contracts, and trade union work. The 16th District Trade Union Office also held a training class, but because the training time was short and the teachers' level was low, the effect was not significant. During the Party rectification education, no systematic education on communism and the Communist Party was conducted for the workers. Although patriotic education was conducted for general employees during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and class education was conducted during the "Five-Anti" movement, this was done by giving lectures to grassroots trade union cadres, who then conveyed them to the workers. Because the political and cultural level of the grassroots trade union cadres was low, the effect of the transmission was also very poor. According to a survey, the thinking of workers and shop assistants is still very chaotic after the "Five-Anti" movement: some believe that "shops should be owned by both labor and capital, and everyone should manage them for the country"; some believe that "capitalists should work as hard as workers, and should be more diligent and thrifty than workers"; some believe that "after the 'Five-Anti' movement, everything will be negotiated by labor and capital and handled according to regulations, and there will be no more exploitation." Some workers from rural areas originally thought that the "Five-Anti" movement was the same as land reform, "if the capitalists are overthrown, everyone will be able to share some of the fruits"; later, when they saw that this was not the case, they were dissatisfied and said: "The city is not as thorough as the countryside," "working day and night is for nothing, and it still offends people." This shows that the Jingxi Mentougou local party committee has not done enough political work among the workers.
II.
    Why haven't the 16th District Committee and the Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union done a good job in the work of workers and shop assistants in private enterprises, especially the education of workers? The main reason is that they did not attach importance to this work. This is manifested in:
    (1) The District Committee does not have a definite leadership system for workers' work. In the early days of liberation, the work of workers in public coal mines was led by the District Committee, and at that time, the District Committee focused on workers' work. However, since the work of public coal mines was directly led by the Municipal Committee, the District Committee has never specifically studied workers' work in the past two years, nor has it sent cadres to go deep into small kilns or industries to understand the workers' demands and inspect the work of the trade union; it has not seriously studied reports on trade union work, and has not given timely instructions to the trade union. In short, they adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards trade union work. Regarding the education of workers, the District Committee believed that it was the responsibility of the trade union, and relaxed leadership and inspection. In particular, the District Committee only passively resolved some labor-capital disputes and workers' welfare issues in its leadership of the Private Enterprise Working Committee, and pushed the regular leadership to the Mentougou Town Committee. However, the Town Committee only has two members, and it is difficult to shoulder the responsibility of leading more than 18,000 workers, so the political and ideological education and cultural education of the workers is very poor.
    The reason why the District Committee does not pay enough attention to the political work of workers is that they lack sufficient understanding of the special circumstances of the district (mining area), and only pay attention to farmers, while neglecting the workers in private industrial and mining enterprises who account for 32% of the residents. In 1951, because the District Committee had never discussed workers' work, Chen Shilin, chairman of the Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union, was no longer participating in the District Committee after approval from higher authorities.
    (2) The Jingxi Coal Mine Trade Union's leadership over the work of private coal kiln trade unions is also very poor. They believe that small kilns do not have a long lifespan, workers have high mobility, and there is also the Town Committee's leadership, so they only emphasize doing a good job in the trade union work of state-owned mines, rarely specifically study the work of the Private Enterprise Working Committee, and do not often urge and inspect it. In addition, the number of cadres assigned to the Private Enterprise Working Committee is also insufficient. There are only nine full-time trade union cadres detached from production (only seven in 1951), of which only one cadre is engaged in propaganda work. Without enough cadres, it is difficult to do a good job in the work of more than 18,000 workers.
III.
    In order to strengthen the political education of workers, consolidate the ideological achievements of the "Five-Anti" movement, and educate workers to unite with capitalists to develop production, the 16th District Committee of Beijing Municipality convened relevant departments in early May to inspect the leadership of workers' work, specifically studied the issue of workers' education in the future, and formulated a short-term political education plan. From late May to the end of June, a class education will be generally conducted among about 2,000 trade union cadres in private enterprises, and nine party member cadres from the District Committee, the District Government, and the Trade Union will be designated as teachers to conduct lectures. Cadres from private small kilns will be concentrated in six areas for lectures, and discussions will be conducted in grassroots trade union units. Attend lectures once a week and have discussions once a week. The education of industry trade union cadres will be the responsibility of the 16th District Trade Union Office.
    The District Committee plans to install loudspeakers in areas where workers are concentrated and use broadcasts to conduct regular education for workers.
    In order to unify the leadership of the political education work of workers in private industrial and mining enterprises and industries, the District Committee intends to propose that the Trade Union, the Communist Youth League, and the Cultural and Education Section of the District Government jointly organize a Workers' Education Committee, which will be directly led by the District Committee. The District Committee will then allocate some of its strength to earnestly do a good job in leading work, and the Propaganda Department of the District Committee will regularly understand and study the ideological situation of the workers and propose education plans in order to strengthen the ideological education work of the trade union. The Mentougou Town Committee should add a production committee member and a propaganda cadre. It is also decided that the miner party members in the street branch should be separately organized according to the miner kiln area in order to conduct education. In order to strengthen the work of young workers, the party's Town Committee should establish cadres for youth work. The Beijing Suburban Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should also appoint dedicated personnel to be responsible for strengthening the work of workers and shop assistants in the suburbs.

    关于北京市第十六区委员会忽视私营工矿职工政治教育工作的检查报告
    中共北京市委宣传部
    编者按：四月十八日本报发表了读者马寗对京西门头沟地方党委不重视工人教育工作的批评以后，中共北京市委宣传部立即派了两个干部到京西门头沟，协助第十六区区委进行了检查，并拟定了短期的工人政治教育计划。现将北京市委宣传部和十六区区委检查的结果及对于今后加强工人教育工作的意见刊载如下：一
    北京市第十六区全区人口共七万八千三百多人，其中固定人口有五万六千六百多人。在固定人口中，非农业人口有三万二千七百多人，约占全区固定人口总数的百分之五十七强。据统计，目前全区有私营煤窑工人一万八千多人（包括固定工人八千多人，流动工人一万多人），分散在一百二十四座小窑工作。流动工人都是河北、热河、察哈尔省的灾民和门头沟附近几县的一部分利用农闲来作工的农民（这一部分人的主要经济来源是依靠作工所得的工资）。此外，还有店员、建筑、搬运、手工业等行业工人七千多人。这就说明，这个地区的工业生产占了很大的比重，因此重视工人的政治工作，乃是当地党委的重大任务。
    在十六区党委领导下的京西煤矿工会，直接领导全区国营、公营机采矿的工会工作，其所属的私营工作委员会，则领导私营小窑的工会工作。私营小窑现有工会会员九千一百多人。私营矿工中现在只有共产党员四十九人，分散在街道支部，没有以生产企业为单位建立党组，因而在工人当中，没有形成党的领导核心。另外，在十六区工会办事处领导下的行业工会会员（包括店员）有四千六百多人，也迫切需要进行教育。
    但是，两年多以来，京西煤矿工会私营工作委员会，对职工的政治教育工作是做得很不够的。工会虽然举办过四期干部训练班，但参加受训的工人仅一千人，而学习的内容也只是工会法、劳保条例、劳资合同、工会工作等。工会十六区办事处也举办过一次训练班，因为训练时间短，教员水平低，效果不大。而在进行整党教育时，也没有向工人进行系统的关于共产主义和共产党的教育。虽然在抗美援朝运动中，对一般职工进行了爱国主义教育，在 “五反”运动中进行了阶级教育，但这是用给工会基层干部讲课，然后由他们向工人传达的方法进行的。由于工会基层干部的政治文化水平低，传达的效果也是很差的。据调查，“五反”运动后，工人和店员的思想还很混乱：有的认为“商店应该是劳资双方所有的，大家都替国家管理”；有的认为“资本家要和工人同样劳动，而且要比工人更勤俭”；有的认为“‘五反’后，一切事都由劳资协商，按规定办事，不会再有剥削了”。有些从农村来的工人原来认为“五反”和土地改革一样，“打倒了资本家，大家都能分点果实”；后来看到事实不是如此，就不满意，说：“城市不如农村搞得彻底”，“白天黑夜地干，是白干了，还得罪人”。这就说明，京西门头沟地方党委在工人中的政治工作是作得很不够的。二
    第十六区党委和京西煤矿工会为什么没有把私营企业工人、店员的工作，尤其是工人的教育工作作好呢？主要因为他们没有重视这一工作。这表现在：
    （一）区委对工人工作没有一定的领导制度。在解放初期，公营煤矿的工人工作归区委领导，那时，区委是以工人工作为中心的。但是，当公营煤矿工作改由市委直接领导以后，两年来区委就从未专门研究过工人工作，也没有专门派干部深入小窑或行业中去了解工人的要求和检查工会的工作；对有关工会工作的报告也没有认真研究，没有及时给工会以指示。总之，他们对工会工作采取了官僚主义的态度。对工人的教育工作，区委认为那是归工会负责的，就放松了领导和检查。特别是对私营工作委员会的领导，区委只是被动地解决一些劳资纠纷和工人福利问题，把经常的领导推给门头沟镇委负责。而镇委只有两个委员，要担负领导一万八千多工人的工作是有困难的，因而对工人的政治思想教育和文化教育就做得很差。
    区委之所以不够重视工人的政治工作，乃是因为他们对于该区（工矿区）的特殊情况，缺乏足够的认识，只注意了农民，忽视了占居民人口百分之三十二的私营工矿的工人。一九五一年，因为区委会从来没有讨论过工人工作，京西煤矿工会主席陈士林经上级批准后，已不参加区委会。
    （二）京西煤矿工会对私营煤窑工会工作的领导也很差。他们认为小窑寿命不长，工人流动性大，又有镇委领导，因此就只强调搞好国营矿的工会工作，对私营工作委员会的工作很少作专门研究，也不经常去督促和检查。另外，分配给私营工会工作委员会的干部也是不足的。脱离生产的专职工会干部只有九人（一九五一年时只有七人），其中又只有一个干部作宣传工作。没有足够的干部，要想把一万八千多工人的工作搞好，也是有困难的。三
    为了加强对工人的政治教育，巩固“五反”运动的思想成果，教育工人团结资方发展生产，北京市第十六区党委在五月初旬召集有关部门检查了对工人工作的领导，对今后工人教育问题作了专门研究，并拟定了短期的政治教育计划。从五月下旬开始至六月底为止，在私营企业的工会干部约二千人中普遍进行一次阶级教育，指定区委、区政府和工会的党员干部九人担任教员，进行讲授。私营小窑的干部分六片集中讲课，以基层工会为单位进行讨论。每周听课一次，讨论一次。行业工会干部的教育由十六区工会办事处负责进行。
    区委准备在工人集中地区装置广播器，利用广播对工人进行经常的教育。
    为了统一领导私营工矿、行业工人的政治教育工作，区委拟建议由工会、青年团、区政府文教科联合组织一个工人教育委员会，由区委直接领导。区委则分出一部分力量切实做好领导工作，由区委宣传部经常地了解和研究工人的思想情况，提出教育计划，以加强工会的思想教育工作。门头沟镇委应增设生产委员和宣传干部。并决定街道支部中的矿工党员，按矿工窑区单独编组，以便进行教育。为了加强青年工人的工作，党的镇委会应设立青年工作的干部。北京市郊委和市总工会也应指定专人，负责加强郊区的工人、店员工作。
