    Xinhua News Agency, June 9th: Rainfall was evenly distributed in most parts of the country in May. The drought in the southwest region has been relieved. Only the southern part of North China and Shandong Province experienced a slight lack of rain, while some areas south of the Yangtze River had excessive rainfall.

    In the Northeast region, rainfall in the first and middle ten-day periods of May was less than 5 millimeters (100 millimeters equals 3 *shi cun*), causing a drought. In the last ten days of the month, most areas successively received thorough rainfall, with rainfall mostly above 25 millimeters. Throughout the Northeast, only the southern part of Liaodong Province, the northeastern part of Songjiang Province, the western part of Jilin Province, and Baicheng and Jingxing counties in Heilongjiang Province had insufficient rainfall. Farmland showed signs of "soil separation," and sandy areas remained dry. In the North China region, rainfall was higher in the north and slightly lower in the south. Rainfall in Suiyuan Province in May was close to 50 millimeters, and most of Chahar Province received about 30 millimeters of rainfall, which was sufficient. The north and central parts of Hebei and Shanxi provinces received about 20 millimeters of rainfall, while southern Hebei, southern Shanxi, and the plains received mostly less than 15 millimeters of rainfall, experiencing a slight lack of rain. In the Northwest region, rainfall was generally sufficient. The Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi areas of Shaanxi Province and most of Gansu Province received 30 to 50 millimeters of rainfall. Southern Shaanxi received about 150 millimeters of rainfall. Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang were not short of rain. In the Southwest region, Sichuan Province, and most of Guizhou and Xikang, received about 200 millimeters of rainfall, equivalent to more than one and a half times the average rainfall for May in previous years. In early May, heavy rains in some areas of western Sichuan caused disasters. Yunnan Province, which had been the driest, also had consecutive thorough rains in the middle and last ten-day periods, and there was no longer a drought. In the Central South region, except for the northern part of Henan Province, where rainfall was close to the average for previous years, the southern part of Henan Province, most of Jiangxi Province, Hubei, Hunan, and parts of Guangdong Province experienced more rain in the first and middle ten-day periods. Local areas experienced floods. In the last ten days of the month, except for Jiangxi Province and the Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang river basins in Hunan Province, which still had occasional heavy rains, rainfall was normal in most areas. In the East China region, Shandong had insufficient rainfall, less than 25 millimeters, showing a slight lack of rain, while other areas had sufficient rainfall. Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and most of Fujian had excessive rainfall, generally above 250 millimeters. Tunxi in southern Anhui and Quzhou County in Zhejiang received more than 400 millimeters of rainfall, resulting in local floods.
