Xinhua News Agency, Guisui:
    All the people of the Hui Autonomous Region in Guisui City, Suiyuan Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, reporting on the situation in the Hui Autonomous Region in the past two years. The letter said: Respected Chairman Mao:
    On the occasion of commemorating the 31st anniversary of the founding of the great Communist Party of China, we, the more than 13,000 people of the Hui Autonomous Region in Guisui City, would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to you, and report to you on the happy life we have obtained under your leadership.
    In the past, the reactionary ruling class slandered us, saying: "Thieving Huis have no ability to govern themselves." However, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, we not only quickly established the Hui Autonomous Region, but also achieved great results. Our Autonomous Region's People's Representatives Conference has 60 Hui representatives, and we have also elected 21 Hui representatives to participate in the People's Representatives Conferences of the province and city respectively. There are also Hui workers in various organs, groups, and enterprises. In the past, we never dared to dream that there would be a place for laboring Huis in government organs! In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our lives were very miserable, and illiteracy accounted for 90 percent of the population. Since the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, it has come up with various ways to support production and improve life for us, and has also established two Hui primary schools, where most of the 1,143 primary school students are children of laboring Huis. In 1950, the Autonomous Region People's Government also opened spare-time schools for the people, and 706 students have attended the school. In addition, in order to improve the health of the Hui people, the government also established an autonomous region health clinic, so that poor laboring Huis in the entire region can receive reduced or free treatment.
    The discrimination and hatred created by successive reactionary rulers between the Hui and Han nationalities have disappeared under your glorious illumination. We truly respect each other. In the first Spring Festival after the establishment of the Autonomous Region, the Hui residents spontaneously organized New Year's greetings groups and wished New Year's greetings to the Han residents of the Autonomous Region from door to door. The Hui people are also more united internally. In the past, the Hui people of the old and new sects were at odds and even did not intermarry. Now they are as dear as family members.
    In the past, we didn't understand what a country was, but now we all cherish our motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm. In the "Resist America, Aid Korea" movement, more than 70% of households in our region signed patriotic pacts and established a regular inspection system. We donated 450 million yuan to purchase the "Hui Nationality" fighter plane, and sent a large number of condolences and gifts to the front line in Korea; in addition, nine Hui children participated in military cadre schools and nursing work on the front line in Korea.
    Respected Chairman Mao, each of us knows deeply who brought about today's happy days! When the person writing the letter was pondering, a street woman named Wu Shuzhen said: "Don't think about it, write 'Thank you, Chairman Mao, support the Communist Party'!" Respected Chairman Mao: These are the words in our hearts. Under your leadership, we will work together with all the fraternal nationalities of the country to build our great motherland!

    绥远省归绥市回民自治区全体人民在“七一”前夕
    向毛主席报告他们两年来的幸福生活
    【新华社归绥讯】绥远省归绥市回民自治区全体人民，在中国共产党诞生三十一周年纪念日的前夕，写信给毛主席，报告回民自治区成立两年来的情况。信上说：敬爱的毛主席：
    在纪念伟大的中国共产党诞生三十一周年的时候，我们归绥市回民自治区一万三千多人民，谨向您致衷心的祝贺和感谢，并将我们在您领导下所得到的幸福生活报告给您。
    过去，反动统治阶级曾经诬蔑我们说：“贼回子，没有自治能力。”可是在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，我们不但很快成立了回民自治区，而且取得了很大成绩。我们自治区各界人民代表会议有六十名回民代表，我们还选举出二十一名回民代表，分别参加了省和市的人民代表会议。在各个机关、团体、企业部门里也都有回族工作人员。过去，我们从不敢梦想政府机关里能有劳动回民的一席之地！我们过去在国民党反动统治下，生活非常悲惨，文盲占人口百分之九十。自治区人民政府成立以后，就为我们想出多种办法扶持生产、改善生活，还设立了两所回民小学校，在学校念书的一千一百四十三名小学生，绝大部分都是劳动回民的子弟。一九五○年自治区人民政府又开办了业余民校，已有七百零六名学生到校学习。此外，为了增进回民的健康，政府还举办了自治区卫生诊疗所，使全区的贫苦劳动回民都能得到减费或免费的治疗。
    历代的反动统治者，在回、汉民族间所造成的歧视和仇恨，在您的光辉照耀下，已经冰消云散了。我们真正做到互相尊重。自治区成立后的第一个春节，回族居民就自动组织拜年团，挨门逐户地向自治区的汉族居民贺年。回族内部也更加团结，过去旧教派、新教派的回民不和，甚至互不通婚，现在亲爱如同家人。
    以前我们不懂得什么是国家，现在我们都以无比的热情爱护自己的祖国。在“抗美援朝”运动中，我们全区百分之七十以上的户订立了爱国公约，并建立起经常的检查制度。我们捐献了四亿五千万元购买“回民号”战斗机，并把大批慰问金、慰问品送到朝鲜前线；此外还有九名回民子弟参加了军事干部学校和朝鲜前线的护理工作。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们每一个人都深深知道今天的幸福日子是谁带来的！当执笔写信的人正在低头思索时，街道妇女吴淑贞说：“不用想啦，写上‘感谢毛主席，拥护共产党’吧！”敬爱的毛主席：这就是我们心坎里的话。我们将在您的领导下，和全国各兄弟民族一道为建设我们伟大的祖国而努力！
