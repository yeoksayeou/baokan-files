Editor's Note: After the People's Daily published an article on June 1st on the third page, "How I Educate Children" by Lü Jingxian, a model teacher at Jingwei Elementary School in Harbin, Northeast China, we received many letters from readers to Lü Jingxian. These letters fully demonstrate the readers' emphasis on people's education and their respect for excellent people's teachers. We have selected three of these letters and published them below.

(I)
Comrade Jingxian: I am a junior high school student in the third grade at Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School, and I will be graduating this summer. Before graduation, we often discuss our studies and work. Some hope to become scientists, writers, or musicians, while others hope to become athletes or tractor drivers. As for me, I have made up my mind: I want to be an "engineer of the human soul" – a people's teacher – and dedicate my life to educating the next generation of our motherland. After reading your article "How I Educate Children," my blood boiled, and I was filled with respect and love for you. Under your education, the children live and learn so happily. If all the teachers in our country could love children as you do and be as loyal to the country's education, our country would be built faster.

I know that teachers must be good at influencing children with their every move and cultivate their excellent qualities and noble virtues in their young minds. So I am often thinking about how to be a good people's teacher. You are a good example for our people's teachers, and I will definitely work hard to learn your work spirit and methods, and contribute my strength to the country's education and the happiness and beautiful future of mankind forever. Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School Wang Shulan

(II)
Comrade Jingxian: When I picked up my pen to write this letter to you, I felt infinite joy and pride in my heart, because I am a future "people's teacher," and we will be working comrades on the same front. I am a student at Nanchang Normal School. After reading your article "How I Educate Children," I truly felt the glory of being a people's teacher and strengthened my confidence in being a good people's teacher. You are an excellent people's teacher, and you are our shining example. Under the education of your vivid deeds, I realized the bright and promising future of people's education and further clarified the great responsibility of educators. I must complete the task assigned to me by the people of the motherland and be a "people's teacher" in name and in fact!
Jiangxi Nanchang Normal School Li Maoxiao

(III)
Comrade Jingxian: We are students from the Gorina group of the Education Department of Yenching University. We were greatly inspired after reading your article "How I Educate Children." You love your career and the children so much. We are also interested in children's education, but our interest starts from a personal perspective. We think that children are innocent and lively, and it is fun to work with them, and that educating children is a leisurely job that is both comfortable and relaxing. We did not think that educating the next generation is a glorious and arduous task.

After the "Three-Anti" Movement, our awareness has improved, and we have initially established a worldview of serving the people. However, due to family background, we still have more or less bourgeois decadent thoughts. We are determined to learn from you and love the people's education like you. After seeing your work spirit, we more specifically realized that to be a good people's teacher, one must first have a high degree of political consciousness, otherwise, we cannot complete the important task assigned to us by the motherland. Today, the political status of teachers has improved, and the Party and the people's attention and care for us make us feel the importance of our responsibilities, so we are more eager to transform ourselves. We must train ourselves in all aspects and strive for the bright future of the motherland. Yenching University Shen Shihan, Cen Chufang, Ding Wanfang, Lin Liqun, Tan Yunsheng

### “你是我们人民教师的好榜样”  ——本报读者们给吕敬先的信

    “你是我们人民教师的好榜样”
    ——本报读者们给吕敬先的信
    编者按：六月一日本报三版发表了东北哈尔滨市经纬小学模范教师吕敬先作的“我是这样教育孩子们的”一文后，曾先后收到许多读者给吕敬先的信。这些来信充分表现了读者们对人民教育事业的重视和对优秀的人民教师的敬爱。我们从这些来信中选了三封，发表在下面。
    （一）
    敬先同志：我是北京第一女子中学初中三年级的学生，今年暑假就要毕业了。在毕业的前夕，我们常常在谈论着各人的学习和工作，有的希望做科学家、文学家、音乐家，有的希望做体育家、拖拉机手。我呢，我已经考虑成熟了，我愿意做一个“人类灵魂的工程师”——人民教师，为教育祖国的下一代而贡献终生的力量。读了你的“我是这样教育孩子们的”一文后，我的血沸腾了，我对你充满了尊敬和热爱。在你的教育下，孩子们是那样幸福地生活和学习着。如果我们国家所有教师都能像你一样地热爱孩子，一样地忠诚于祖国的教育事业，我们的祖国将会建设得更快。
    我知道教师必需善于用自己的一举一动去影响孩子们，要在孩子们的幼小心灵里，培养他们的优秀品质和高尚德性。所以我常常在寻思如何才能做好一个人民教师。你是我们人民教师的好榜样，我一定努力学习你的工作精神和方法，永远为祖国的教育事业和人类的幸福美好远景而贡献出自己的力量。　北京第一女子中学　王淑兰
    （二）
    敬先同志：当我执笔写这封信给你的时候，我的心里感到无限的愉快和骄傲，因为我是一个未来的“人民教师”，我们将是同一战线上的工作同志。我是南昌师范学校的学生，读了你的“我是这样教育孩子们的”一文后，我真正感觉到做一个人民教师的光荣，加强了自己做好一个人民教师的信心。你是一个优良的人民教师，你是我们的光辉榜样。在你的生动事迹的教育下，我认识了人民教育事业的前途的光明远大，更明确了教育工作者的责任的重大。我一定要好好地完成祖国人民交给我的任务，做一个名符其实的“人民教师”！
    江西南昌师范学校　李懋孝
    （三）
    敬先同志：我们是燕京大学教育系戈林娜小组的同学，读了您的“我是这样教育孩子们的”一文后，得到了很大的启发。您是这样热爱自己的事业，热爱孩子们。我们也有兴趣做儿童教育工作，可是我们的兴趣是从个人出发的，觉得孩子天真活泼，很好玩，教育孩子的工作是清闲的工作，既舒适又轻松。我们并没有想到教育下一代的工作是光荣而又艰巨的。
    经过“三反”运动以后，我们的觉悟都有所提高，我们都初步建立了为人民服务的人生观。但是由于家庭出身关系，我们或多或少还残存着资产阶级的腐朽思想。我们下决心向您学习，像您一样地热爱人民教育事业。看到了您的工作精神以后，我们更具体地体会到要做好一个人民教师，首先应具有高度的政治觉悟，否则就不能很好地完成祖国交给我们的重大任务。今天，教师的政治地位提高了，党和人民对我们的重视和关怀，使我们更感到自己责任的重大，因此也就更迫切地要求改造自己。我们一定要从各方面来锻炼自己，为祖国的美好将来而努力。燕京大学　沈适菡　岑楮芳
