    Anti-Drought Sowing Campaign Launched Across Pingyuan Province
    The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government has issued an urgent directive requiring all localities to immediately lead farmers in anti-drought summer sowing. Pingyuan Province has been experiencing a prolonged drought, and due to insufficient soil moisture after the wheat harvest, late autumn crops cannot be sown. Following the issuance of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government's urgent directive, an anti-drought sowing campaign has been launched throughout the province. In the Lake West Special District, counties such as Jiaxiang and Yutai have sown 780,000 mu of soybeans and late millet. In the Xinxiang and Anyang Special Districts, the Guangli River, Dan River, Baiquan Canal, and Wanquan Canal have released water to irrigate over 22,000 mu of land. In Qixian County's First District, the Li Yutian water well mutual aid team in Nanyang Village has set a provincial record by irrigating 59 mu of land with one water well, irrigating 15 mu in one day and night. The team has promoted this irrigation method throughout the village through mass meetings, inspiring farmers to adopt long-term drought prevention strategies. The farmers of Nanyang Village are now determined to continue expanding the irrigated area, planning to dig another 90 earth wells and purchase 15 more waterwheels to complete the summer sowing and ensure a bumper harvest. In the anti-drought sowing campaign, the Huixian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased a large number of water buckets to supply farmers, helping them solve the tool difficulties during spot sowing.
    This spring, Pingyuan Province has dug a total of 30,500 new wells, which, if fully utilized, will be a significant guarantee for this anti-drought sowing effort. However, some areas have not provided organized leadership for drought resistance, and some farmers have a paralyzing wait-for-rain mentality, resulting in many wells not being well used. According to a survey of six counties, including Huaxian and Puyang, over 60 percent of the wells are not being fully utilized in the drought resistance effort. In Fanxian County, there are over 1,800 wells, but 1,500 of them are idle. To address this, the Provincial People's Government has instructed all special districts and counties to conduct thorough inspections and resolve this issue, ensuring that all existing canals, wells, and water tools are fully utilized in the anti-drought campaign. The directive also pointed out that loans should be issued quickly in various places to ensure that all wells that have not yet installed waterwheels and windlasses are equipped. In addition, all localities should organize farmers to use water rationally, and call on farmers to implement shallow irrigation and ditch irrigation methods to save water, expand the irrigated area, and ensure timely sowing of more than 20 million mu of late autumn crops after wheat.

### 平原省各地开展抗旱播种运动

    平原省各地开展抗旱播种运动
    平原省人民政府已发出紧急指示，要求各地立即领导农民抗旱夏种。平原省久旱不雨，大部麦田收割后因墒土不足，晚秋作物不能下种。平原省人民政府的紧急指示发出后，抗旱播种运动已在全省各地展开。湖西专区嘉祥、鱼台等县已播种豆子，晚谷等七十八万亩。新乡、安阳两专区的广利河、丹河、百泉渠、万全渠已放水浇地二万二千多亩。淇县一区南阳村李玉田水井互助组，创造了一眼水井浇地五十九亩，一天一夜浇地十五亩的全省最高纪录。该组已将此浇地办法，通过群众大会在全村推广，启发农民长期防旱的思想。现在南阳村农民决继续扩大灌浇面积，拟再打土井九十眼，增购水车十五辆，以完成夏种，保证丰收。在抗旱播种运动，辉县供销合作社购了大批水桶供应农民，帮助农民解决点种时的工具困难。
    平原全省今春共打新井三万零五百眼，如果都能发挥最大的作用，将是这次抗旱播种的重大保证。但有些地方对抗旱未予有组织的领导，加以某些农民存在着麻痹等雨思想，大部水井未被很好使用。据滑县、濮阳等六县调查，百分之六十以上的井在抗旱中未充分利用。范县有井一千八百余眼，闲着的就有一千五百眼。为此，省人民政府已指示各专区、各县，立即深入检查，解决这个问题，使现有一切渠道、水井、水具，在抗旱运动中充分发挥作用。指示还指出：各地应迅发贷款，使现在还未安装水车、辘轳的井一律安上。此外，各地应把农民组织起来合理用水，并号召农民实行浅浇沟灌法，以求节约用水，扩大浇地面积，确保二千多万亩麦后晚秋作物的适时下种。（新华社）
