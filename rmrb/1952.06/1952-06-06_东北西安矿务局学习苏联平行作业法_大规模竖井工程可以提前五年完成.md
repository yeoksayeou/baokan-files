The Northeast Xi'an Mining Bureau Studies the Soviet Parallel Operation Method
Large-Scale Shaft Project Can Be Completed Five Years Early
    The Northeast Xi'an Mining Bureau has successfully learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet parallel operation method in the construction of shaft projects. This is a major event in the economic construction of Northeast China.
    The shafts constructed by the Xi'an Mining Bureau are very large in scale. After formal mining begins, the daily coal production will be equal to the total daily output of the four major mines under the mining bureau: Taixin, Fuguo, Dacheng, and Dongcheng. This project started in 1950 using the single-line operation method, that is, the workers first drilled downwards, and after drilling to a depth of thirty or forty meters, they built the wall upwards around the well from below. After the wall was built to the top, they continued to drill downwards. In this way, they alternated every thirty or forty meters until the bottom of the well. This old-fashioned Anglo-American method of building shafts was very inefficient, with a monthly progress of only seven meters. At this rate, it would take at least ten years to build a well more than 500 meters deep, from the construction of the wellbore, the installation of ground machinery and equipment, the underground transportation lanes to the coal production. Therefore, the workers said: "Let's get to work! When the well opens, we'll be young lads, and when the coal comes out, we'll be white-bearded old men."
    The parallel operation method was proposed last April by Soviet expert Shiman’ko when he came to the Xi'an Mining Bureau to help build the shaft. The basic characteristic of the parallel operation method is to carry out the two main processes of shaft construction (drilling and wall construction) at the same time, without having to wait for each other. That is, when the drilling workers drill to a depth of forty meters, they build a wall seat, and then a group of wall-building workers specialize in building the wall upwards from the wall seat, while another group of drilling workers continue to drill downwards. In this way, drilling and wall construction are carried out simultaneously, which shortens the project by half. Since the Xi'an Mining Bureau began implementing the parallel operation method last July, it has not only accelerated the progress, but also reduced costs, and also ensured the quality of the wellbore and safe operations. According to the current progress calculation, the wellbore project can be completed in August this year. After the installation of above-ground equipment and the completion of underground transportation lanes, formal mining can begin in 1954, shortening the entire project by five years.
    After the Xi'an Mining Bureau promoted this advanced experience, it not only saved a large amount of investment for the country economically, but more importantly, it accelerated the speed of coal mine industrial construction. To this end, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government recently issued instructions on promoting the parallel operation method in coal mine construction projects. It also instructed the Northeast Industry Department Coal Mine Administration and other units to immediately formulate measures and plans for implementing the parallel operation method for all new wells; to ensure the smooth promotion of this advanced experience.

    东北西安矿务局学习苏联平行作业法
    大规模竖井工程可以提前五年完成
    东北西安矿务局在建设竖井工程中，学习苏联平行作业法的先进经验成功。这是东北经济建设上的一件大事。
    西安矿务局建设的竖井规模很大，正式开采后，煤的日产量将等于现在该矿务局所属泰信、富国、大成、东城四大矿日产量的总和。这一工程在一九五零年开工时用的是单行作业法，即工人先向下凿岩，等凿到三、四十公尺深时，再从下边围着井往上砌壁。壁砌到顶头，再继续往下凿岩。就这样，每隔三、四十公尺轮流一次，直到井底。这种陈旧的英美式的建设竖井的方法，效率很低，月进度只达七公尺。用这样的进度建设一个五百多公尺深的井，从建设井筒、安装地面机器设备、井下送道以至出煤，至少需要十年的时间。因此，工人们说：“干吧！开井的时候是年轻小伙子，出煤的时候就是白胡子老头了。”
    平行作业法是去年四月苏联专家石曼阔来到西安矿务局帮助建设竖井时提出的。平行作业法的基本特点是把建设竖井的两道主要工序（凿岩和砌壁）同时作业，不必互相等待。即凿岩的工人凿到四十公尺深的地方时就砌一个壁座，然后由一部分砌壁的工人专门从壁座上往上砌壁，另一部分凿岩工人则继续往下凿岩。这样凿岩和砌壁同时进行，就缩短工程的一半时间。西安矿务局在去年七月开始实行平行作业法以后，不但加速了进度，而且降低了成本，还保证了井筒的质量和安全作业。按目前进度计算，井筒工程到今年八月就可竣工，井上设备安装及井下送道完成之后，一九五四年就可以正式开采，使整个工程缩短了五年的时间。
    西安矿务局推行了这一先进经验后，不仅在经济上为国家节省大批投资，更重要的是加速了煤矿工业建设的速度。为此，东北人民政府工业部在最近发出关于在煤矿建井工程中推行平行作业法的指示。并责成东北工业部煤矿管理局等单位立即做出关于所有新井实行平行作业法施工的措施计划；保证这一先进经验的顺利推广。　（据新华社讯）
