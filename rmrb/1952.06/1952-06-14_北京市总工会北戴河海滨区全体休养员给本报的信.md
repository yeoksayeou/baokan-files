To the Editor: We, forty-eight model workers from various factories and mines in Beijing, are the first group to come to the Beidaihe Workers' Sanatorium for recuperation. We are truly overjoyed to be able to come here for recuperation today.

Here, we are surrounded by the sea on three sides and backed by mountains on one side, with extremely beautiful scenery. Standing in the sanatorium, we can see the rolling sea and the scattered sails of fishing boats, as if we were in a painting. We live very well here. Every day we can drink one pound of milk and eat fresh fish, meat, and other nutritious foods. There is also ample time for sleep. We often go to the seaside for walks, chat on the beach, play games, and pick up seashells. The sports facilities here are also very complete, and everyone can participate in various cultural and recreational activities according to their own preferences. The young people love group dances, and many older people also participate in the dancing. We also have joint gatherings with the students of local middle schools and primary schools, who give us many wonderful and moving performances. We are also preparing to have joint gatherings with local agricultural model workers and industrial model workers from Tianjin to exchange experiences. Reading the newspaper is also an indispensable lesson for us every day. In such a lively and happy life, who can not feel physically and mentally happy? In just a few days, everyone's weight has generally increased.

We feel very ashamed to be able to come here for recuperation because our contribution to the motherland is still too small. We firmly guarantee that after returning to our jobs, we will definitely work hard to study diligently, humbly learn, and lead everyone to do a good job in the production increase and economy practice movement, so as to build our motherland even more beautifully.

    北京市总工会北戴河海滨区全体休养员给本报的信
    编辑同志：我们北京各厂、矿企业的四十八个劳动模范，第一批来北戴河工人休养所休养。我们今天能够来这里休养，真有说不出的高兴。
    这里三面环海，一面靠山，风景十分优美。站在休养所里，就可以看到海水滚滚，渔帆点点，如在画中。我们在这里生活得很好。我们每天能喝到一磅牛奶，吃到鲜鱼、肉类和其他富于营养的食品。睡眠的时间也很充足。我们时常到海滨去散步，在沙滩上聊天，作游戏，拣蚌壳。这里的运动设备也很完备，每人可以根据自己的爱好，参加各种文化娱乐活动。年青的小伙子热爱集体舞，很多年老的人也参加了舞蹈。我们还和当地的中学、小学的学生联欢，他们给我们演出许多精彩动人的节目。我们还准备和当地农业劳动模范及天津市的工业劳动模范联欢，以便交流经验。看报也是我们每天不可少的一课。在这样活泼幸福的生活中，谁能不身心愉快呢？短短的几天，大家的体重就普遍增加了。
    我们能来到这里休养，感到很惭愧。因为我们对祖国的贡献还太少。我们坚决保证，回到工作岗位以后，一定努力钻研，虚心学习，带领大家搞好增产节约运动，把我们的祖国建设得更美好。
    北京市总工会北戴河海滨区工人休养所全体休养员
