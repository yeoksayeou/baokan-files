Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th (TASS dispatch)

The whole world is shocked and angered by the bloody crimes committed by the U.S. military in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.

Yesterday, the working people of our capital held a city-wide rally in the Hall of Columns of the Moscow Trade Union Building. The rally of the working people of Moscow expressed the feelings of millions of workers, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals—the entire Soviet people—and passed a resolution protesting the bloody crimes of the American aggressors in Korea.

The people of all countries have not forgotten the crimes of the Hitlerite bandits, nor the horrors of the Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Majdanek death camps, where fascist executioners slaughtered millions of people. Now, only a few years after the end of World War II, the people of all countries are seeing the monstrous crimes committed by American imperialists in Korea.

The American soldiers, as well as the instigators and protectors of their predatory war against the Korean people, have openly embarked on the brutal and unscrupulous path of Hitler, the path of bloody banditry.

The predatory war of aggression waged in Korea for the past two years has more forcefully demonstrated the beastliness of American imperialism. After encountering the heroic resistance of the heroic Korean people, the American aggressors have resorted to the heinous means of large-scale massacres of human beings. They barbarously bomb, destroy, and burn Korean cities and villages, soaking the Korean land with the blood of civilians. The American aggressors have also used bacteriological and chemical weapons, surpassing the Hitler fascist bandits in brutality.

The bloody events committed by the U.S. military on Geoje Island—"the island of terror and death"—and the atrocities committed by the U.S. military against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and against Korean peaceful residents, seriously violate the principles of human morality, violate all the norms of international law, and constitute heinous crimes against humanity.

The whole world is now familiar with some irrefutable evidence and documents that reveal the horrific conditions under which tens of thousands of prisoners of war—soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers—are being tortured. Torture, beatings, and indiscriminate killing of prisoners of war are commonplace on Geoje Island. Prisoners of war are branded with red-hot iron bars, hung upside down, and have their noses filled with cold water. In secret U.S. military laboratories, prisoners of war are used as experimental subjects to test the effects of new, horrific poisonous gases and infectious bacteria.

The American barbarians forcibly tattoo prisoners of war and force them to sign statements with their own blood that require them to betray their motherland. The purpose of these American actions is to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs as cannon fodder.

The facts of the U.S. military's atrocities on Geoje Island have been confessed by the former head of the prisoner-of-war camp, U.S. Brigadier General Colson. After this, even the reactionary American newspapers have had to talk about the bloody crimes on Geoje Island.

According to Korean sources, the American executioner and hangman Bonner, who arrived on Geoje Island, intends to commit new, shameful, and monstrous crimes with the knowledge and consent of the U.S. high command. U.S., British, and Canadian troops and tanks are being transported to Geoje Island for conquest. A reporter for the British "Observer" wrote not long ago that the most brutal atrocities on Geoje Island may be coming soon.

The American masterminds and perpetrators of the shocking crimes on Geoje Island, exposed with their hands full of blood, are doing everything possible to quibble and deny. World public opinion is angrily demanding an end to the atrocities of the American interventionists in Korea, which has made them panic-stricken.

Progressive humanity expresses its angry protest against the American interventionists' open and reckless violation of the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention on the humane treatment of prisoners of war.

The whole world, all the people, now see with their own eyes that the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island vividly illustrates the infamous "American way of life," the so-called "American democracy"; and that the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp is a new American version of Hitler's bloody "new order."

The bloody banditry of the U.S. military in Korea has aroused angry protests from millions of people, aroused angry protests from all freedom-loving people. The people of all countries are more vigilant against the conspiracies of the imperialist instigators of a new world war, and are more closely united in the struggle for world peace.

Now, no decent person can fail to feel the burning flame of hatred in their hearts when they see the monstrous crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea. No one who loves freedom and peace can fail to feel deep sympathy for the just cause of the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending justice.

The people of our motherland are engaged in peaceful construction labor and are at the forefront of the great movement for world peace. Together with all progressive humanity, they demand an end to the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea.

    必须制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行
    ——苏联真理报五月三十日社论摘要
    全世界对美军在巨济岛战俘营所干的血腥罪行，感到非常震惊和愤怒。
    我们祖国首都的劳动人民昨天在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了全市大会。莫斯科市劳动人民的大会表示了千百万工人、集体农民和苏联知识分子——全体苏联人民——的心情，它通过了抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜的血腥罪行的决议案。
    各国人民还没有忘记希特勒匪徒的罪行，还没有忘记奥斯威辛、布痕瓦尔德和麦丹尼克的死亡营中的恐怖情况，在这些死亡营中，法西斯刽子手屠杀了千百万人民。现在，在第二次世界大战结束后仅仅几年，各国人民竟又看到美帝国主义者在朝鲜干的滔天罪行了。
    美国军人，以及他们对朝鲜人民发动掠夺战争的鼓动者和保护者，已公然走上了希特勒的暴虐无道的道路，走上了干血腥的土匪行径的道路。
    两年来在朝鲜进行的掠夺性的侵略战争，已更有力地表明了美帝国主义的兽性。美国侵略者在遭到英雄的朝鲜人民的英勇抵抗后，便采取了万恶不赦的大规模屠杀人类的手段。他们野蛮地轰炸、破坏和焚烧朝鲜的城市与乡村，使朝鲜国土浸透了平民的鲜血。美国侵略者并使用了细菌武器和化学武器，在残暴方面超过了希特勒法西斯匪徒。
    美军在朝鲜巨济岛——“恐怖和死亡之岛”——上干的血腥事件，美军对朝中战俘和对朝鲜和平居民的暴行。严重地违反了人类道德的原则，违反了国际法的一切准绳，构成了对人类的滔天罪行。
    全世界现在都很熟识一些无可辩驳的证据和文件，这些证据和文件揭露了数万战俘——朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的士兵——正在遭受折磨的恐怖情况。酷刑、拷打和不分青红皂白的屠杀战俘，在巨济岛是司空见惯的事。战俘被烧红的铁条烙烫，被倒吊起来，被用凉水灌鼻子。在秘密的美军实验室中，战俘被用来作为试验品，试验新的可怖的毒气和传染性细菌的效果。
    美国野蛮禽兽强行在战俘身上刺字，强迫他们用自己的鲜血签署要他们背叛祖国的声明。美国采取这些行为的目的，是为了强迫扣留朝中战俘，并把他们送给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮作炮灰。
    美军在巨济岛的暴行事实，已为前俘虏营负责人美国柯尔生准将所招认了。在这以后，甚至美国的反动报纸也不得不谈到巨济岛的血腥罪行了。
    据朝鲜消息说，到达巨济岛的美国刽子手和绞刑吏波纳，打算在美国高级指挥部的知悉及同意下再干新的可耻的滔天罪行。进行征讨的美国、英国、加拿大的军队和坦克正在运往巨济岛。英国“观察家报”的记者在不久以前写道，巨济岛上最残酷的暴行可能快要到来了。
    巨济岛惊人罪行的美国主谋者和执行者在满手鲜血的时候被揭发了，他们便尽一切可能诡辞狡赖。世界舆论愤怒地要求制止美国干涉者在朝鲜的暴行，这使得他们惊惶失措。
    进步人类对于美国干涉者公然不顾一切而违犯关于给予战俘人道待遇的海牙公约和日内瓦公约的行为，表示愤怒的抗议。
    全世界、全体人民现在都亲眼看到了：美国在巨济岛的战俘营生动地说明了声名狼藉的“美国生活方式”，说明了所谓“美国民主”；而且看到了巨济岛战俘营是希特勒血腥的“新秩序”的新美国版。
    美国军方在朝鲜的血腥强盗行为，激起了千千万万人的愤怒抗议，激起了全体爱好自由的人民的愤怒抗议。各国人民更加警惕帝国主义新世界战争挑拨者的阴谋，在争取世界和平的斗争当中，更紧密地团结起来了。
    现在，凡是正派的人，决不会眼看着美国侵略者在朝鲜犯下的滔天罪行而不感到内心燃烧着憎恨的火焰。凡是爱好自由与和平的人，也决不会看着英雄的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军保卫正义的事业而不感到深切的同情。
    我们祖国的人民从事和平建设劳动，走在伟大的争取世界和平的运动的最前列。他们和全体进步人类一道，要求制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行。
