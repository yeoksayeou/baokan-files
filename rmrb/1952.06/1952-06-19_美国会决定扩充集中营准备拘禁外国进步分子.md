    Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch, TASS: The U.S. Congress has taken further action to expand concentration camps across the country. The House of Representatives has approved a bill passed earlier by the Senate authorizing the Attorney General to use funds from the Justice Department's regular expenses to build more "facilities for detaining foreigners."
    The House Judiciary Committee's report on the bill included a letter from the Commissioner of Immigration, Mackey, which pointed out that the McCarran "Internal Security Act" authorizes the Attorney General to arrest "foreigners liable to deportation." Mackey said that the detention facilities are "completely inadequate for the plan passed by Congress."
    The U.S. Department of Justice wants to portray this as if these new concentration camps are only for Mexican workers who have entered the U.S. "illegally."
    However, these concentration camps are not just for Mexicans. U.S. officials have made it clear that they intend to detain foreign progressives as political prisoners.

    美国会决定扩充集中营准备拘禁外国进步分子
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国国会已采取进一步行动来扩充全国集中营。众议院已批准参议院早些时候通过的一个法案，授权司法部长动用司法部经常费用里面的款项来增建“拘留外国人用的设备”。
    众议院司法委员会就这个法案所提出的报告中附有移民局局长麦凯的一封信，这封信指出，麦卡伦“国内安全法”授权司法部长逮捕“应予放逐的外国人”。麦凯说，拘留设备“对国会通过的计划说来是完全不够的”。
    美国司法部想把这件事说成是：这些新的集中营只是为了“非法”进入美国的墨西哥工人而设的。
    可是，这些集中营并不只是为了墨西哥人而设的。美国官员已经明白表示，他们打算把外籍的进步分子当作政治犯拘禁起来。
