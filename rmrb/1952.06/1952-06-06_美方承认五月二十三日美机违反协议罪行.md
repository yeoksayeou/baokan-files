Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 5th: On June 2nd, the U.S. side admitted that U.S. military aircraft violated the agreement by flying over the Panmunjom conference area on May 23rd. This was already determined by a joint investigation by the security officers of both sides at the time. However, U.S. Liaison Officer Colonel Kinney only recently sent a memorandum to our Chief Liaison Officer Colonel Zhang Chunshan, admitting that three U.S. military aircraft did fly over the conference area at 9:25 a.m. on the 23rd, and had to "express regret" for the occurrence of this incident. This violation of the agreement occurred less than twenty-four hours after the former chief representative of the U.S. negotiating delegation, Joy, made false claims about his "sincerity" in the Korean armistice negotiations inside the Panmunjom conference tent. The full text of Colonel Kinney's memorandum to Colonel Zhang Chunshan is as follows: "Memorandum to Colonel Zhang Chunshan, Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers: Regarding the incident jointly investigated by the security officers of both sides on May 23rd, it has now been determined that a flight of three United Nations Command aircraft inadvertently crossed over the Panmunjom restricted area at 9:25 a.m. on May 23rd. Regret is expressed for the occurrence of this incident, and the United Nations Command will continue its efforts to avoid overflights of the conference area to the extent feasible within the technically accepted restrictions by both sides. Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command, U.S. Air Force Colonel Kinney. June 2, 1952."

    美方承认五月二十三日美机违反协议罪行
    【新华社开城五日电】六月二日美方承认五月二十三日美方军用飞机违反协议，飞越板门店会场区上空。这是当时双方安全军官共同调查就已确定了的。但美方联络官肯尼上校直到最近才以备忘录一件致我方首席联络官张春山上校，承认二十三日九时二十五分确有三架美国军用飞机飞越会场区上空，不得不对此事的发生“表示遗憾”。这一违反协议事件，是在美方谈判代表团前首席代表乔埃在板门店会议帐篷内，谎谈其对朝鲜停战谈判的“诚意”后，尚不足二十四小时发生的。美方肯尼上校致我方张春山上校备忘录全文如下：“备忘录致朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军首席联络官朝鲜人民军上校张春山：关于五月二十三日经双方安全军官共同调查的事件，兹已确定三架联合国军飞机的一次飞行，曾于五月二十三日九时二十五分无意地越过板门店限制区上空。对此事件的发生表示遗憾，联合国军将继续其努力在双方接受的技术限制的可行范围内，避免对会议区的飞越。联合国军首席联络官美国空军上校肯尼。一九五二年六月二日”
