Chairman of the Presidium, esteemed delegates, honored guests:

The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is now open! This is a grand gathering of great unity for the national industrial and commercial circles. First of all, I extend warm congratulations to all the delegates present!

This meeting is a preparatory representative conference; it is not yet a representative assembly itself, but it already possesses broad representation. Among the total of 414 delegates, there are representatives from state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, joint state-private enterprises, and private enterprises. Among the 320 representatives from private enterprises, there are representatives from large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises in large, medium, and small cities across the country, as well as representatives from handicraftsmen, stallholders, and capital agents. From home to overseas, from large cities to the remote frontiers of the motherland, representatives of industrial and commercial circles are gathering today in the capital of the people's motherland to discuss the organization of industry and commerce itself, as well as issues related to industry and commerce. This is an epoch-making event in the history of China's industrial and commercial circles. This is only possible after Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to liberate all of China and achieve the unity of the people. Here, we pay our highest respect to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party!

Esteemed delegates: Through this Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, we will establish a preparatory committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Before the official establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the preparatory committee will exercise its functions and powers. Therefore, our meeting shoulders a major task: it will create a national organization for industry and commerce itself. As early as the preparatory stage of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese Communist Party and relevant democratic parties had consulted on the issue of organizing the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. However, due to the limitations of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, both politically and organizationally, it was not possible to proceed too early. In the two years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the development of the people's democratic life and the restoration and development of the national economy, the appearance of most industrialists and businessmen has also changed to varying degrees; industrial and commercial federations in major and medium-sized cities have also been gradually established, and some have undergone preliminary consolidation and transformation. Therefore, in October 1951, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, after consulting with representatives from industrial and commercial circles in various regions, actively promoted the preparatory work for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. After seven months of steady preparation, under the guidance and promotion of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, with the strong support of the Chinese Communist Party and leaders of governments at all levels, and the efforts of the comrades in the preparatory office, the first stage of preparation has been successfully completed, thereby laying a broad and solid foundation for the establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The work that has already been started by the preparatory office will be continued by all the delegates present. We believe that, with the expectation and support of the national industrial and commercial circles, and with the efforts of all the delegates, this task will definitely be completed victoriously.

(I)

As everyone knows, the new China is now a new democratic society, and its economic structure includes five economic components. Chairman Mao instructed us in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "In order to cope with imperialist oppression, in order to improve the backward economic status, China must utilize all urban and rural capitalist factors that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood rather than harmful, and unite the national bourgeoisie to fight together." The fourth chapter of the Common Program, "Economic Policy," states clearly: "The fundamental policy of economic construction in the People's Republic of China is to develop production and prosper the economy by adopting the policies of giving consideration to both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, assisting both urban and rural areas, and promoting internal and external exchanges." Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has consistently adopted the policy of "encouraging the enthusiasm for their operation and supporting their development" towards industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program. The fact that industries and businesses across the country, except for a very small number that are not suitable for the new society's requirements and need to be adjusted or transformed, have all shown a thriving phenomenon in the past two and a half years is the best proof of this.

We should acknowledge that industrialists and businessmen have made considerable contributions to the great development of national construction in the past three years. They have played a certain role in restoring production, promoting urban-rural exchange, and facilitating internal and external exchanges. They have also donated airplanes and artillery in support of the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; patriotic overseas Chinese and industrialists and businessmen among ethnic minorities in the country have also done their best in different regions and environments. This aspect is positive. However, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that many people in our industrial and commercial circles still retain the filth left over from the old society. The main content of this filth is bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. These filth were fully and thoroughly exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and therefore were criticized and denounced by public opinion, and a small number who completely violated the law were also punished by law. The "Five-Anti" movement launched by the Central People's Government is a movement for industrialists and businessmen to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones and to cure diseases to save people, and also a great social reform movement to change customs and habits. This is of decisive significance for the transformation of our industrialists and businessmen. The People's Government, adhering to the principle of combining severity with leniency and combining transformation with punishment, after strictly examining the five vices of industrialists and businessmen, also took care of their difficulties in verifying and finalizing cases and refunding and supplementing taxes, and implemented lenient treatment.

As mentioned above, private industry and commerce have both a positive and progressive side and a negative and decadent side. The positive and progressive side is manifested in the fact that our industrialists and businessmen operate economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, make contributions to society, and are beneficial to the new China. The five vices, on the other hand, are extremely harmful to the country and the people, which is the negative and decadent side. Undoubtedly, we should encourage and promote the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen and criticize and oppose their other aspect of negativity. What should be the standard for judging positivity and negativity? We believe that the Common Program should be the standard. All thoughts and actions of industry and commerce that conform to the Common Program are positive thoughts and actions; all thoughts and actions that violate the Common Program are negative thoughts and actions. The Common Program is the only standard for measuring whether our industrialists and businessmen are beneficial or harmful to the people, positive or negative; we have no second standard.

The "Five-Anti" movement has now come to a victorious conclusion. In the movement, the filth of our industrial and commercial circles has been strictly liquidated and cleansed. After this movement, the foundation of the people's democratic united front has become more consolidated, the people have become more united, and the appearance of industrial and commercial circles has also been renewed. The convening of this preparatory representative conference happens to be after the victorious completion of the "Five-Anti" movement, which is of special significance. Because through this mass movement, the political consciousness of industrial and commercial circles has been raised compared to the past, the ranks of industrial and commercial circles have become more orderly, purer, and more united under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party to work hard for the economic construction of the new China! The favorable conditions created by the "Five-Anti" movement are unprecedented in any previous period.

(II)

Delegates! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the new China is like the rising sun, and the future is infinitely bright and far-reaching. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the ranks of industrial and commercial circles are more orderly than before. In such a new situation, how should we convene this preparatory representative conference to accomplish the new historical mission entrusted to us? Here, I offer the following suggestions for the delegates to discuss:

First, we must conscientiously abide by the provisions of the Common Program and obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. Premier Zhou instructed us at the 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on January 5th this year: "In the new democratic China, first, we cannot talk about giving consideration to both public and private interests in isolation, but must talk about giving consideration to both public and private interests under the condition of obeying the state economic leadership, that is, to take care of private interests in accordance with the principle of conforming to the highest and long-term interests of the vast majority of the people in the country. Second, we cannot talk about benefiting both labor and capital abstractly, but must talk about benefiting both labor and capital on the premise of recognizing the leadership of the working class, in order to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy. Third, we cannot advocate blind production, but must gradually realize the leadership of the state's overall production plan. Whether it is public or private, urban or rural, central or local, ... must be gradually incorporated into the plan. Otherwise, the blind production of industry and agriculture will lead to surplus and shortage, and the blind operation of commerce will disrupt the market and fluctuate prices. Fourth, we cannot allow profiteering, but can only obtain legitimate profits within the limits prescribed or agreed upon by the state." Premier Zhou's remarks should be instructions that all industrialists and businessmen in the country must follow. We must realize that if private capital breaks away from the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, it will definitely return to the old road of capitalism, which is extremely harmful to all the Chinese people, including our industrialists and businessmen, and is absolutely not allowed in the new China. Honestly abiding by the Common Program and obeying the leadership of the working class, the state-owned economy, and the state plan, and no longer committing the five vices, is the prerequisite for the development of private industry and commerce. I hope that our national industrial and commercial circles will pay special attention to this. This is the first point.

Second, we should correctly promote the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen for production and operation. We said above that industrialists and businessmen have a positive side and a negative side. The "Five-Anti" movement proves that the five vices of industrial and commercial circles in various regions are quite common and quite serious, that is to say, this movement exposed both the illegal and law-abiding aspects of industrial and commercial circles. Some industrialists and businessmen have shown new, proper enthusiasm after this movement, but some industrialists and businessmen inevitably feel hesitant and uneasy, lose their self-confidence, and some even doubt that the government's policy has changed, thinking that the new China may not need the national bourgeoisie to exist. This kind of thinking is unfounded and completely wrong. The national bourgeoisie still has its place in the new democratic society, and it is still one of the four friends under the leadership of the working class. The "Five-Anti" movement is only against the five vices of illegal bourgeois elements, not to eliminate the bourgeoisie. The Common Program is the fundamental law of our country. As long as industrialists and businessmen obey the leadership of the working class, the state-owned economy, and the state plan, abide by the Common Program, and operate economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood in accordance with the Common Program, not only will there be no reason to be eliminated, but they will also be welcomed by the masses of the people. After this "Five-Anti" movement, the operation of enterprises has more favorable conditions for development than before. After the elimination of corruption and waste in management, the production enthusiasm of workers has been improved, the operation has been improved, the production cost has been reduced, and legitimate profits have been more guaranteed. Of course, we are not saying that there are no difficulties in the future of industry and commerce. During the transition period, there are difficulties. Especially after the "Five-Anti" movement, some new difficulties will inevitably occur. However, we should admit that these difficulties are difficulties in the process of development and difficulties in the improvement of the economy. With difficulties, they must be solved. Those that we can solve ourselves should be solved through efforts; those that can be solved by local governments have been or are being solved by local governments; if there are still national issues that need to be resolved with the assistance of the central government, they should be raised in this preparatory representative conference, and specific suggestions for solutions should be proposed. We believe that all reasonable suggestions can be gradually resolved under the guidance of the People's Government's reasonable and reasonable policies. We must broaden our horizons and see the great development prospects of the new China, correctly promote the enthusiasm for production and operation, and enable private industry and commerce to develop properly. This is the second point.

Third, our industrialists and businessmen should strengthen learning and strengthen self-education and ideological transformation. In the past two or three years, the learning of industrial and commercial circles has been successful and progressive, but it is still far from enough. The discovery of many examples of violating the Common Program in the "Five-Anti" movement is a clear proof that we have not learned enough. I hope that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, through our own organization, we will launch an organized and planned learning movement in accordance with the Notice on Learning Issues of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. What should we learn? First of all, we should learn the Common Program and the government's policies and regulations. We cannot be satisfied with the textual understanding of the Common Program; we must also understand its spirit and essence, and combine it with our own practice to achieve consistency in words and deeds. We must make all industrialists and businessmen in the country truly understand the significance of the Common Program, recognize the development prospects of the new democracy, recognize that all private industries and businesses must seek development under the state's overall economic plan, and recognize that the ideas of blind development and illegal profiteering are incompatible with the new democratic society and must be thoroughly transformed. In addition to learning documents, our industrialists and businessmen should also learn to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and must devote themselves to various great people's revolutionary movements to seek their own thorough transformation. Only in this way, and only in this way, can our industrialists and businessmen adapt to the development of the new China, live up to the great era of Mao Zedong, and contribute our own strength to the new society. This is the third point.

Fourth, we must unite and help each other. Before liberation, especially during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to the unbalanced economic development in various parts of the country, and due to the feudal separatist nature created by the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, there was often a lack of unity between large cities and small and medium-sized cities, between large industries and small and medium-sized industries, and even between large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises in the same industry. They would monopolize, exclude each other. "Rivals in the same trade are enemies" became a cliché. After liberation, this situation has greatly improved. However, because there has not yet been a national organization in the past, and many local organizations have not completed thorough consolidation and transformation, the unity and mutual assistance of the national industrial and commercial circles is very insufficient. After this preparatory representative conference, our industrial and commercial circles must sincerely cooperate, establish a national organization, and consolidate and transform local organizations at all levels, so that this organization conforms to Premier Zhou's instructions: "The Federation of Industry and Commerce will gradually become an organization of the entire industrial and commercial circles, including all cities, all classes, and all industries, and enabling small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen to enjoy equal rights." Therefore, large cities and large enterprises should take the initiative to unite small and medium-sized cities and small and medium-sized enterprises, and small and medium-sized cities and small and medium-sized enterprises should also recognize the importance of large cities and large enterprises. This kind of mutual assistance and mutual concession, mutual unity, establishing a new morality and new atmosphere for industrialists and businessmen in the new era, and everyone working together in the leadership of the state's overall economic plan, achieving division of labor and cooperation, each getting what they need, will play a huge role in the development of our country's new democracy. This is the fourth point.

(III)

Esteemed delegates: Our meeting shoulders the important task of establishing a national organization for industrial and commercial circles. We must be clear in our understanding that the Federation of Industry and Commerce is a united front organization of industrial and commercial circles of a new democratic nature. It is a people's organization under the leadership of the People's Government, including all industrialists and businessmen, and aiming to implement the Common Program and develop the new democratic economy. Therefore, the Federation of Industry and Commerce should be different from the chambers of commerce and industrial associations under the rule of the reactionary regime in the past. It should not only represent the industrialists and businessmen to the People's Government to reflect opinions and put forward suggestions, but also lead the industrialists and businessmen to promote the Common Program and the policies and regulations of the People's Government, guide private industrialists and businessmen to develop production and improve management under the state's overall economic plan, and also organize industrialists and businessmen to carry out learning and participate in various patriotic movements. However, the situation reflected in the "Five-Anti" movement proves that although the organizations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in various places have mostly been established, many of them are still very unsound in organization and cannot shoulder the responsibilities they should have. There is an urgent need to carry out necessary and appropriate reorganization. Since the Federation of Industry and Commerce is an organization of the united front, including enterprises of various natures, including different classes and strata, they also have different roles in the national economy. Therefore, it must take into account the interests of different classes and strata under the general principles of the Common Program. Only when the different interests of all parties can be properly taken care of, so that the different strata can each get what they need, can the Federation of Industry and Commerce truly become a people's organization of the entire industrial and commercial circles.

(IV)

Esteemed delegates: Our task is arduous, but it is also great and glorious. In the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories on all fronts of politics, economy, military, and diplomacy. Our industrialists and businessmen have also played a considerable role in the restoration and adjustment of the national economy. However, we cannot be complacent because of this. Our efforts and achievements are still backward compared to the objective needs, and there are even mistakes. After this "Five-Anti" movement, the country is about to enter a great era of economic construction. The people of the whole country today further require us industrialists and businessmen to completely eliminate the five vices and exert greater strength, greater enthusiasm and creativity in the great people's construction cause, so that this effort plays a certain role in accelerating the industrialization of our country. This is beneficial to the people of the whole country, and it is also beneficial to us industrialists and businessmen. We must not fail to live up to this expectation of the people of the whole country.

Finally, we must call out to the national industrialists and businessmen to unite, under the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, to strive for the development of production, the prosperity of the economy, and the construction of a new democratic new China!

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议开幕词
    陈叔通主席团、各位代表、各位来宾：
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议今天开幕了！这是全国工商界大团结的一个盛会。首先，我向到会的各位代表致热烈的祝贺！
    这次会议，是一个筹备代表会议，它本身还不是代表大会，但它已经具有广泛的代表性，全部四百一十四名代表中，包括着国营企业、合作社、公私合营企业、私营企业的代表，而私营企业的三百二十名代表中又包括了全国大、中、小城市中的大、中、小工商企业，以至手工业者、摊商、资方代理人的代表，还有国内少数民族、海外侨胞以及中央和各地区与工商界有关的人士。从国内到海外，从大城市到祖国辽远边疆的工商界代表，今天在人民祖国的首都聚首一堂，讨论工商界自身的组织以及工商业的问题，这在中国工商界历史上是一件划时代的大事。这只有在毛主席和中国共产党领导中国人民解放了全中国，实现了人民的统一后，才有了这种可能。这里，我们敬向中国人民的领袖毛主席与中国共产党致崇高的敬意！
    各位代表先生：经过这一次全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议，我们将要成立全国工商业联合会的筹备委员会，在全国工商业联合会正式成立前，筹备委员会将代行它的职权。因此，我们的会议担负着一件重大的任务，它将要产生工商界自身的全国组织。远在中国人民政治协商会议的筹备时期，中国共产党和有关的民主党派即曾协商过筹组全国工商业联合会的问题，但无论在政治上、组织上都因为当时工商界自身条件的限制，而不能过早地进行。中华人民共和国成立后两年间，由于国内人民民主生活的发展，以及国民经济的恢复和发展，大多数工商业者的面貌也发生了不同程度的改变；各大、中城市的工商业联合会也已经逐步建立，部分并已经过初步的整理改造。因此，一九五一年十月中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会经过与各地工商界的代表协商后，积极推动全国工商业联合会的筹建工作。经过过去七个月来稳步进行的筹备，在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的指导和推动下，在中国共产党和各级人民政府首长的大力支持和筹备处同人的努力下，已经胜利地完成了筹备的第一阶段工作，从而为建立全国工商业联合会奠定了广泛而坚实的基础。现在筹备处已经开始的工作，将由到会的全体代表来继续完成。我们相信，在全国工商界的瞩望和支持，在各位代表先生们的努力下，这
    一任务是一定可以胜利完成的。
    （一）
    如众周知，新中国现在是新民主主义的社会，它的经济构成包括了五种经济成份。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中指示我们：“为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了使落后的经济地位提高一步，中国必须利用一切于国计民生有利而不是有害的城乡资本主义因素，团结民族资产阶级，共同奋斗”。共同纲领第四章“经济政策”中开宗明义就说：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。”中央人民政府成立之后，对于有利于国计民生的工商业，便是本着毛主席的指示与共同纲领的规定，一贯的采取“鼓励其经营的积极性，并扶助其发展”的方针。两年半来，全国工商业除了极少数不适合于新社会人民要求，需要调整或改造的以外，无不呈现着欣欣向荣的现象，这就是最好的一个明证。
    我们应该承认，在过去三年来国家建设的伟大发展中，工商业者是有相当贡献的。在恢复生产和城乡交流、内外交流等方面，都起了一定的作用。在支援伟大的抗美援朝运动中又捐献了飞机大炮；在海外的爱国侨胞、在国内少数民族中的工商业者，也都在不同地区、不同环境下，尽了力量。这方面是积极的。但另一方面，也不容讳言，我们工商业者的很多人们中仍旧存在着旧社会遗留下来的污毒，这些污毒的主要内容就是行贿，偷税漏税，盗窃国家资财，偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报等。这些污毒在这次“三反”“五反”运动中，全部地、彻底地暴露出来了，因而受到社会舆论的批评、指摘，少数完全违法的还受到法律的制裁。中央人民政府所发动的“五反”运动，对我们工商业者说来，是一个惩前毖后、治病救人的运动，也是一个伟大的移风易俗的社会改革运动，这对我们工商业者的改造，有着决定的意义。人民政府本着严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针，在严格地检查了工商业者的五毒之后，又在核实定案、退财补税方面，照顾了他们的困难，实行宽大的处理。
    如上所述，私营工商业既有它积极的进步的一面，也有它消极的腐朽的一面。积极的进步的一面，表现在我们工商业者经营了有利于国计民生的经济事业，对社会有所贡献，对新中国是有利的。而五毒罪行则是对国家对人民极端有害的，这就是消极腐朽的一面。无疑地，我们应该鼓励和发扬工商业者的积极性，批评和反对他们另一方面的消极性。积极性与消极性究竟应该以什么为标准呢？我们认为应该以共同纲领为标准。工商界凡是符合共同纲领的思想与行动，都是积极的思想与行动；凡是违背共同纲领的思想与行动，都是消极的思想与行动。共同纲领是衡量我们工商业者对人民有利或有害，积极或消极之唯一标准，我们别无第二个标准。
    “五反”运动现在已经胜利地结束了，在运动中我们工商界的污毒受到了一次严格的清算和洗涤。经过了这个运动之后，人民民主统一战线的基础更加巩固，人民内部更加团结，工商界的面貌也为之一新了。这次筹备代表会议的召开，恰好在“五反”运动胜利完成之后，这是有特殊意义的。因为通过了这次群众性的运动，工商界的政治觉悟已较前提高，工商界的队伍更加整齐，更加纯洁，也更加团结在毛主席与中国共产党领导之下为新中国经济建设而努力了！“五反”运动所造成的这种有利条件，是为过去任何时期所未曾具备的。
    （二）
    代表先生们！新中国在毛主席与中国共产党领导下，正如旭日东升，前途是无限光明与远大。在“五反”运动之后，工商界的队伍较前整齐了。在这样的一种新的形势下，我们召开这次筹备代表会议，应该怎样完成新的历史赋与我们的使命呢？这里，我贡献下列几点意见，供代表先生们研讨：
    首先，我们必须切实遵守共同纲领的规定，服从工人阶级与国营经济的领导。周总理在今年一月五日中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第三十四次会议上曾经指示我们：“在新民主主义的中国，第一、不能孤立地讲公私兼顾，而一定要在服从国家经济领导的条件下讲公私兼顾，就是说要在符合全国最大多数人民的最高的和长远的利益的原则下照顾私人利益。第二、不能抽象地讲劳资两利，而一定要在承认工人阶级领导的前提下讲劳资两利，以达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。第三、不能提倡盲目生产，而一定要逐步实现国家生产总计划的领导。无论公与私，城与乡，中央与地方，……都必须逐步纳入计划。否则，工农业的盲目生产，就会发生过剩与不足，商业的盲目经营，就会扰乱市场，波动物价。第四、不能容许谋取暴利，而只能在国家规定的限度或议定的价格内取得合法利润。”周总理这一番话，应该是全国工商业者所必须遵循的指示。我们必须认识到，如果私人资本脱离了工人阶级与国营经济的领导，那就一定会返回去走到资本主义的老路上去，这是对全中国人民，包括我们工商业者在内，都是极其有害的，是新中国所绝对不许可的。老老实实遵照共同纲领办事，服从工人阶级、国营经济与国家计划的领导，不再犯五毒是发展私营工商业的先决条件，希望我们全国工商界特别要注意到这一点。这是第一点。
    其次，我们应该正确地发扬工商业者生产和经营的积极性。上面我们说过工商业者有积极性的一面，也有消极性的一面。“五反”运动证明：各地工商界的五毒行为是相当普遍和相当严重的，也就是说，这次运动暴露出工商界违法和守法的两方面。有一些工商业者经过这次运动，出现了新的正当的积极性，但也有一些工商业者情绪上不免有些彷徨不安，失去了自信心，有的甚至怀疑政府的政策有所改变，以为新中国也许不需要民族资产阶级存在了。这种思想是毫无根据的，是完全错误的。民族资产阶级在新民主主义社会中是依然有它的地位的，它依然是工人阶级领导下的四个朋友之一。“五反”运动仅仅是反对不法资产阶级分子的五毒，而不是要消灭资产阶级。共同纲领是我们国家根本的大法，工商业者只要服从工人阶级、国营经济与国家计划的领导，遵守共同纲领，依照共同纲领办事，经营有利于国计民生的经济事业，非但没有被消灭的理由，而且为人民大众所欢迎。经过了这次“五反”运动之后，企业经营比以前具备了更有利的发展条件。管理上的贪污浪费消灭之后，工人们的生产积极性提高了，经营改善，生产成本降低，合法利润更有了保障。自然，我们不是说工商业的前途便没有任何困难了。在过渡期间，困难是有的。尤其在“五反”运动以后，当然要发生一些新的困难。但是，我们应该承认，这些困难，是发展过程中的困难，是经济好转中的困难。有了困难，就必须解决，凡是我们自己可以解决的，应该努力求得解决；地方政府可以解决的，地方政府已经或正在设法解决；如其尚有属于全国性的，须待中央政府协助解决的，就在这次筹备代表会议中提出来，并建议解决的具体意见。我们相信，一切合理的建议，在人民政府合情合理的政策方针指导下，是可以逐步得到解决的。我们必须把眼光放远放大，看到新中国伟大的发展前途，正确地发扬生产和经营的积极性，使私营工商业得到正当的发展。这是第二点。
    第三，我们工商业者应该加强学习，加强自我教育与思想改造。过去两三年中，工商界的学习是有成绩的，有进步的，不过还很不够。“五反”运动中，发现很多违反共同纲领的事例，便是我们学习得不够的明证。我希望全国工商业联合会筹备委员会成立之后，通过我们自己的组织，根据人民政协全国委员会关于学习问题的通知，进行一个有组织有计划的学习运动。学习什么东西呢？首先是学习共同纲领，以及政府的政策法令。我们对共同纲领，不能仅以文字的了解为满足，还要领会它的精神与实质，并与自己的实践结合起来，做到言行一致。我们要使全国工商业者都切切实实了解共同纲领的意义，认识新民主主义的发展前途，认清一切私营工商业都必须在国家总的经济计划下求发展，认清盲目发展与非法牟利的思想，都是与新民主主义社会不相容的思想，都必须彻底地加以改造。除了学习文件以外，我们工商业者还应该学习运用批评与自我批评的武器，必须投身于各种伟大的人民革命运动中，以求自己的彻底改造。只有这样，也必须这样，我们工商业者才能适应新中国的发展，才不辜负伟大的毛泽东时代，也才能贡献我们自己的力量于新社会。这是第三点。
    第四，我们必须团结互助。解放以前，尤其在国民党反动统治时代，由于全国各地经济发展的不平衡，由于半封建半殖民地社会所造成的封建割据性，往往使得大城市与中小城市之间，大行业和中小行业之间，甚至同一行业的大企业与中小企业之间，常闹不团结，把持包办，互相排挤。“同行是冤家”竟成了一句口头禅。解放以后，这种情况是大大地好转了。但因为过去还没有一个全国性的组织，有许多地方性的组织也没有完成彻底的整理和改造，全国工商界的团结互助是很不够的。经过了这次筹备代表会议，我们工商界要切实精诚合作，建立起全国性的组织，整理和改造各级地方组织，使这个组织，符合于周总理所指示的：“工商业联合会将逐渐成为全体工商界的、即包括各城市、各阶层和各行业的、并使中小工商业者享有平等权利的组织。”因此，大城市和大企业应主动团结中小城市和中小企业，而中小城市和中小企业也应该认识大城市大企业的重要性。这样互助互让，互相团结，树立新时代工商业者的新道德新风气，大家在国家总的经济计划领导下，做到分工合作，各得其所，这对我国新民主主义的发展，是会起着巨大的作用的。这是第四点。
    （三）
    各位代表先生：我们的会议担负着建立工商界的全国性组织的重大任务，我们必须在认识上明确：工商业联合会是新民主主义性质的工商界的统一战线组织，它是在人民政府领导下，包括全体工商业者在内，以贯彻共同纲领发展新民主主义经济为目的的人民团体。因此，工商业联合会应不同于过去反动政权统治下的商会和工业会，它不仅应该代表工商业者向人民政府反映意见、提出建议，同时也应该领导工商业者推行共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，指导私营工商业者在国家总的经济计划下发展生产，改善经营，还应该组织工商业者进行学习和参加各种爱国运动。但“五反”运动中所反映的情况证明：各地工商业联合会的组织虽然大多已经建立，但其中有许多在组织上还很不健全，不能担负起应有的责任，急切需要进行必要的和适当的改组。工商业联合会既然是统一战线的组织，包括着各种不同性质的企业，包括着不同的阶级与阶层，它们在国家经济上也有不同的作用。因此它就必需在共同纲领的总原则下照顾到不同的阶级与阶层的利益。只有在各方面不同的利益都能得到适当的照顾，使不同的阶层都能各得其所，工商业联合会才能够真正地成为全体工商界的人民团体。

    各位代表先生：我们的任务是很艰巨的，但也是很伟大很光荣的。三年来中国人民在毛主席与中国共产党领导下，在政治、经济、军事、外交各个战线上，都已获得了辉煌的胜利。我们工商业者在国家经济的恢复和调整中，也曾起了相当的作用。但是我们不能因此而自满，我们努力的成绩与客观需要比较起来，还是很落后的甚至还有错误。经过了这次“五反”运动之后，国家即将进入一个伟大的经济建设时代，全国人民今天都进一步要求我们工商业者，能够彻底清除五毒，在伟大的人民建设事业中，发挥更大的力量，发挥更大的积极性与创造性，使得这种努力在加速我们国家工业化的过程中，起着一定的作用。这对全国人民是有利的，对我们工商业者也是有利的，我们一定不要辜负全国人民的这种期望。
    最后，我们要高呼全国工商业者团结起来，在毛主席和中央人民政府的光辉照耀之下，在工人阶级与国营经济的领导之下，为发展生产，繁荣经济，建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗！
