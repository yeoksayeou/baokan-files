    The First Great Communist Construction Project
    Arkadiy Sugonov, Director of the "Red Army" Construction Area of the Volga-Don Canal, USSR
    Our two great rivers—Russia's Volga and China's Yangtze—are far apart. Their waters flow into different oceans, but the same sun shines on their mirror-like surfaces, and the same feeling unites the Soviet and Chinese people—a feeling of strong, friendly affection.
    The people of the Soviet Union and China are fighting side by side for peace and happiness. According to the brilliant plan of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of all peoples, the largest water conservancy project—the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station and the Volga-Don Navigation Canal—has been built in the heroic Stalingrad region. They have transformed the natural environment of the vast border areas of the Soviet Union, turning nearly sixteen million hectares of arid grassland and semi-desert land into beautiful fields and pastures after receiving water irrigation. At the same time, the state has obtained a large amount of cheap electricity. Five seas have been linked together to form a single, huge transportation system. We, the Soviet people, call these and other huge construction projects the great communist construction.
    The long-held dream of the Russian people has been realized. The Volga-Don Canal is now open to navigation.
    The entire country helped us build this great Stalin-era construction project. Powerful machines, materials, and equipment were sent to us from every corner of our motherland. Our earthwork and cement pouring projects are all completed by mechanical methods. In our work, scientists and engineers, various academies, scientific research institutes, and laboratories often give us great help. This kind of national help and the achievements of socialist production competitions are leading us to victory.
    The water of the Don River has been poured into the Volga River. The waters of the two rivers have met in the concrete dam of the first lock near the Volga River. We, the builders of the canal, calculate time not in hours but in the flow rate of the Don River's water. Not long ago, the water of the Don River filled a reservoir located at the top of the watershed, and at noon on May 24, the water automatically flowed downhill towards the Volga River. All three locks in our "Red Army" construction area are ready to hold the water. The canal lying between the locks is like a long, stone-paved canyon. Recently, our work has been particularly busy and combative. Thousands of people of different professions are working bravely. Construction workers, after completing their own sections of work, run to help other comrades. The famous excavator operator Dmitry Slebukh started working in our construction area. Later, he was assigned to excavate the canal at the watershed, and recently he helped the Tsabulnikov construction area complete the construction of several locks. People jokingly call Dmitry Slebukh a "millionaire" because his excavator has removed more than one million cubic meters of soil from the canal.
    The female driver Polina Smeshnikova, who drives a multi-bucket excavator, works excellently in our section. These days, she is working selflessly in a neighboring construction area. During her working hours, she has completed nearly five times the quota of work.
    The entire staff of the famous giant automatic mobile excavator has completed their work. Each bucket of this excavator can hold fourteen cubic meters of soil. It has excavated nearly 2.8 million cubic meters of soil from the riverbed of the canal. The entire team of this excavator is led by engineer Anatoly Uskov. During the great Battle of Stalingrad, Uskov fought the enemy in this area, protecting this heroic city. Not far from the canal, there is still a trench where Uskov's shells were fired to strike the enemy.
    It is impossible to talk about all the heroes on the Volga and Don Rivers in this short article; there are thousands of them. They work regardless of time, and they automatically ask to be sent to the most difficult jobs. When building Lock No. 8, the workers of that section collectively wrote a letter to engineer Alexander Oguryayev. The letter said: "Please let us stay to participate in the next shift's work. We are now on the most important section, and we will not leave until all the work is completed."
    Everyone is doing it this way.
    Everyone—excavator drivers, fitters, and engineers—is working happily and proudly.
    In these days, we particularly strongly feel the care and attention of all the people and the entire great motherland for us. The Urals, Ukraine, the Caucasus, all the border areas are working hard to help us effectively complete our work. A few days ago, two ships full of flowers were sent from Moscow, the capital of our motherland, to the Volga-Don Canal construction area for planting in the flower gardens, parks, and squares opened along the Volga-Don Canal. Stalingrad sent us the best construction team, who helped us quickly complete the decoration of the lock arches. Stalingrad factories have also assisted us in mechanical repairs and the quick and accurate completion of our orders.
    While realizing Comrade Stalin's brilliant plan to transform nature, we are also watching the creative labor of the Chinese people with joy and pride. The labor achievements of the builders of the great New China are encouraging us. Under the wise guidance of their great leader Mao Zedong, and under the leadership of their Communist Party, the capable Chinese people are confidently building their happy lives.
    We, the construction workers of the Volga-Don Canal, have a special feeling of love and respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers and General Kim Il-sung's soldiers who are fighting heroically for freedom and independence and who are as close to us as family. We firmly believe that they will win. The evil American aggressor bandits will be judged in the people's court, just like the crazy Hitler fascist bandits of that year. Imperialism is doomed to destruction. In our century, all roads lead to communism.

    第一个伟大的共产主义建设工程
    苏联伏尔加—顿运河“红军”建筑区主任  阿尔卡基·苏戈诺哥夫
    我们两条伟大的河流——俄国的伏尔加河和中国的长江——彼此的距离是遥远的。它们的水流入了不同的海洋，但是在它们那如镜的水面上却映射着同一个太阳，团结着苏联人民和中国人民的是同一种感情——巩固的、友好的感情。
    苏中两国人民正在并肩为和平与幸福而斗争。根据各族人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志的天才计划，在英雄的斯大林格勒区建筑了最大的水利建设工程——斯大林格勒水力发电站和伏尔加—顿通航运河。它们改造了苏联广大的边区的自然环境，使得近一千六百万公顷的干燥的草原和半沙漠地，在获得水利灌溉后变成了美丽的田野和牧场，同时也使国家获得了大量的廉价的电力。五个海被联结起来，而成为一个单一的、巨大的运输系统。我们苏联人民把这些和其他一些巨大的建筑工程称为伟大的共产主义建设。
    俄国人民很久以来的梦想实现了。伏尔加—顿运河现在已经开始通航了。
    整个国家都帮助我们建筑这个伟大的斯大林时代的建设工程。从我们祖国的每一个角落里为我们送来了强大动力的机器、物资和设备。我们的土方和浇灌水泥的工程，全是用机械化方法来完成的。在工作中，科学和工程人员们、各个科学院、各种科学研究所和实验室都经常给我们以巨大的帮助。这种全民的帮助和社会主义的生产竞赛的成绩，带引着我们走向胜利。
    顿河的水已灌入了伏尔加河。这两条河的水已经在靠近伏尔加河的第一道水闸的混凝土筑成的水堰中相会了。我们这些运河的建筑者们，不是用小时而是用顿河的水的流速来计算时间的。不久以前，顿河的水注满了位于分水岭顶端的一个水库，在五月二十四日的正午，这些水便自动向低处流向伏尔加河。所有我们“红军”建筑区的三个水闸都已准备好容纳这些水。在各个水闸之间横卧着的运河就像一条长长的，用石块砌成的峡谷一样。最近一段期间内，我们的工作特别忙碌而富于战斗性。千万个不同职业的人们在勇敢地劳动着。建筑工作人员们在完成本工段工作后，就跑去帮助其他的同志。著名的挖掘机手季米特里·斯列布哈是在我们的建筑区开始工作的。后来他被分配到分水岭挖掘运河，最近他又帮助察布尔尼柯甫建筑区完成了几个水闸的建筑工程。人们玩笑似地称季米特里·斯列布哈为“百万富翁”，因为他的挖掘机曾从运河中运走了一百万立方公尺以上的泥土。
    驾驶多斗式挖掘机的女司机鲍林纳·斯梅什尼科甫娜在我们这一工段上工作得很出色。在这些日子中，她正在邻近的一个建筑区中忘我地工作着。在她的工作时间里，曾完成了接近于五倍定额的工作。
    著名的巨大自动移动挖掘机的全体工作人员们已完成了他们的工作。这个挖掘机的每个槽斗可容纳十四立方公尺的泥土。它曾从运河的河床中挖走近二百八十万立方公尺的泥土。这一挖掘机的全体工作者是由工程师安纳多利·乌斯可夫所领导。在伟大的斯大林格勒的会战中，乌斯可夫曾在这一地带和敌人作战，保护着这个英雄的城市。在离开运河不远的地方现在还保留着一条战壕，乌斯可夫的炮弹就是从那里发射出去打击敌人的。
    在这一篇短文里不可能谈到所有在伏尔加河、顿河上的英雄们，他们是数以千计的。他们工作不计较时间，他们自动要求派到最困难的工作中去。在建筑第八号水闸的时候，该工段的工人们集体写信给工程师亚历山大·奥古梁也甫。信上说：“请让我们留下参加下一班的工作。我们现在是在最重要的工段上，在完成全部工作以前，我们不离开。”
    大家都是在这样地干着。
    所有的人——挖掘机的司机们，装配匠们和机师们，都兴高采烈地工作着。
    在这些日子中，我们特别有力地感觉到全体人民和整个伟大祖国对我们的关怀和注意。乌拉尔、乌克兰、高加索，所有的边区都在努力帮助我们有效地完成工作。前些日子，由我们祖国的首都莫斯科送到伏尔加—顿运河工程地带装满两只轮船的鲜花，以供我们沿伏尔加—顿运河开辟的各处花圃、公园和广场栽用。斯大林格勒为我们派来了最好的建筑小队，他们曾帮助我们很快地完成水闸拱门的装修工作。斯大林格勒各工厂在机械修理和迅速而准确地完成我们的订货方面，也曾给予我们以帮助。
    和实现天才的斯大林改造自然的计划的同时，我们也在以愉快和骄傲的心情注视着中国人民的创造性的劳动。伟大的新中国的建筑者们的劳动成果，正在鼓舞着我们。在他们的伟大领袖毛泽东的英明指示下，在他们的共产党的领导下，能干的中国人民正在有信心地建设着自己的幸福生活。
    我们这些伏尔加—顿运河的建筑工作者们，对于英勇地为自由和独立而战斗的、和我们亲近如一家人的中国人民志愿军和金日成将军的战士们，怀有特别敬爱的感觉。我们坚决地相信，他们将获得胜利。罪恶的美国侵略者匪帮，将和当年疯狂的希特勒法西斯匪徒一样，在人民的法庭面前受到审判。帝国主义是注定要毁灭的。在我们的世纪，条条道路都是通向共产主义的。
