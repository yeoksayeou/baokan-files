Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 24th: The U.S. Eighth Army announced on the 23rd that it would resume "screening" of 45,000 of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. This conclusively and irrefutably proves that the U.S.'s insistence on the so-called plan of only 70,000 of our captured personnel "voluntarily repatriating" is a fabricated hoax.

According to news from U.S. and British news agencies, a spokesman for the U.S. Eighth Army stated that the U.S. began "resuming screening" of the 45,000 POWs who had not yet been "screened" on Geoje Island at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd. Sources from the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that when the U.S. side put forward the unreasonable figure of only repatriating 70,000 of our POWs on April 19th, U.S. Colonel Hickman said at the administrative meeting at the time that this figure was the result of so-called "screening" obtained "carefully and cautiously." Hickman also told British and American reporters that this was the result of "investigating the opinions of approximately 173,000 POWs and detained civilians during the secret meeting adjournment of the United Nations Command from April 4th to 19th." The U.S. chief representative, Harrison, also stated at the delegates' conference of the two delegations on May 30th that "screening has been completed" and that it was "completed in a fair manner." But now, the U.S. Eighth Army has announced that 45,000 of our captured personnel have not yet been "screened" and that they will be subjected to "first-time screening." This self-contradictory approach by the U.S. has used its own hand to tear off the false mask of the liar who fabricated the so-called "voluntary repatriation" of only 70,000 of our captured personnel.

The facts are very clear: In order to detain our captured personnel, the U.S. used barbaric methods such as cutting off food supplies and large-scale massacres to forcibly "screen" our captured personnel. After this illegal act encountered the resolute resistance and life-risking struggle of our captured personnel, the U.S. simply discarded even the "screening" mask and unscrupulously fabricated the number of 70,000, calling it the result of "fair screening" and forcing us to accept it.

The Korean and Chinese side sources further pointed out that it is worth noting that although the U.S.'s "screening" hoax has completely failed, their representatives in the conference hall still insist on a plan based on this hoax. Outside the conference hall, they dare to openly "resume" "screening," which has been proven to be synonymous with persecuting and massacring POWs, and continue to violate the Geneva Convention and continue to infringe on the rights of POWs. Not only that, but the day before, the U.S. also announced that it would hand over 27,000 of our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee gang. On Geoje Island, according to U.S. news agencies, U.S. troops openly murdered two of our captured personnel. This series of new provocative actions by the U.S. is clearly intended to make the already severely deadlocked POW issue even more unsolvable and to place more stumbling blocks on the road to an armistice in Korea.

### 美方继续“甄别”我被俘人员  证明美方方案是个大骗局

    美方继续“甄别”我被俘人员
    证明美方方案是个大骗局
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美国第八军在二十三日宣布恢复“甄别”巨济岛上四万五千名我方被俘人员，这就最后地、无可置辩地证明了美方坚持的所谓只有七万我方被俘人员“自愿遣返”的方案，是一个凭空捏造的大骗局。
    据美英通讯社消息，美国第八军发言人称：美方在二十三日上午九时开始对巨济岛上尚未“甄别”的四万五千名战俘“恢复甄别”。此间朝中方面人士指出，在四月十九日美方提出只遣返我方七万战俘的蛮横无理的数字时，美方希克曼上校在当时的行政性会议上曾说什么这个数字是“仔细地与谨慎地”得出的所谓“甄别结果”。希克曼还对英美记者说，这是“联合国军在四月四日到十九日秘密会议休会期间，调查了大约十七万三千战俘和被拘留平民的意见”的结果。美方首席代表哈利逊，在五月三十日双方代表团代表大会上也说什么“甄别业已完成”，而且还说是以什么“公平的方式完成的”。而现在，美国第八军却宣布有四万五千名我方被俘人员尚未“甄别”，而要对他们进行“第一次甄别”。美方这种前后自相矛盾的作法，就用自己的手摘下了他们捏造所谓只有七万我方被俘人员
    “自愿遣返”的骗子的假面具。
    事实已经非常清楚：美方为了扣留我方被俘人员，曾用断绝食粮供应，大规模屠杀等野蛮手段对我方被俘人员进行强迫“甄别”。在这种非法行为遭遇到我方被俘人员的坚决反抗、冒死斗争以后，美方遂连“甄别”这个假面具也都干脆抛开，不择手段地凭空臆造出七万人这个数目，而把它叫做“公平甄别”的结果，强迫我方接受。
    朝中方面人士进一步指出，值得注意的是，虽然美方的“甄别”骗局已经彻底破产，而在会场内，他们的代表却依然坚持以这个骗局为基础的方案，在会场外，他们更敢于公开地“恢复”已经证明是和迫害屠杀战俘同义的“甄别”，公开地继续违反日内瓦公约，继续侵犯战俘的权利。不仅如此，在这以前一天，美方还宣布了要把二万七千名我方被俘人员移交给李承晚匪帮，在巨济岛，据美国通讯社透露，美国军队又公然杀害我方被俘人员二名。美方这一连串新的挑衅行为，显然是要使已经陷于严重僵局的战俘问题更加无法解决，在朝鲜停战的道路上安置更多的绊脚石。
