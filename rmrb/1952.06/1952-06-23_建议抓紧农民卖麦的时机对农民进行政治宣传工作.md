    Suggest Seizing the Opportunity of Farmers Selling Wheat to Conduct Political Propaganda Work for Farmers
    Editor: Currently, state-owned grain companies are purchasing new wheat from farmers in large quantities. Our Hefei sales department of the Anhui Branch of the China Grain Company has more than a thousand farmers queuing up to sell wheat every day. Taking advantage of the time farmers spend selling wheat, we use cartoons and loudspeakers to explain the significance of the state's purchase of new wheat to farmers. We also conduct class education for farmers by comparing the new and old societies, and promote the superiority of mutual aid production. The farmers reflect that: we come to sell wheat and learn at the same time, it's really killing two birds with one stone.
    However, the Hefei local party committee and the propaganda department do not pay attention to this propaganda work. The radio station only broadcast the People's Daily editorial on purchasing new wheat once, and did nothing else. We contacted Anhui Radio Station, requesting them to broadcast more materials on this topic, but they declined, saying: "You can broadcast these yourselves!" We also compiled some slogans related to the combination of purchasing new wheat and politics, and sent them to the Hefei Municipal Party Committee for review, but have not received a reply so far.
    I suggest that local party committees and propaganda and education departments seize the opportunity of purchasing wheat to conduct political education for farmers. Local grain companies should also actively cooperate with the propaganda departments to conduct propaganda and education for farmers.

    建议抓紧农民卖麦的时机对农民进行政治宣传工作
    编辑同志：目前各国营粮食公司正在向农民大量收购新麦。我们中国粮食公司皖北分公司合肥门市部每天总有一千多个农民排着队来卖麦子。我们乘着农民来卖麦子的空隙时间，就利用漫画、扩音器向农民说明国家收购新麦的意义，并以新旧社会对比的方法，向农民进行阶级教育，宣传互助生产的优越性。农民们反映说：我们一面来卖麦子，一面来上学，真是一举两得。
    但是，合肥地方党委和宣传部门并不重视这一宣传工作，广播电台只广播了一次人民日报关于收购新麦的社论，别的什么也没有作。我们曾经和安徽广播电台联系，要求他们多多广播这方面的材料，他们却推辞说：“这些你们去广播好了！”我们也曾编写了一些有关收购新麦和政治结合的标语口号，送中共合肥市委审核，但至今没有回音。
    我建议各地党委及宣传教育部门抓紧收购小麦的时机，向农民进行政治教育。各地粮食公司也应主动地配合宣传部门向农民进行宣传教育。
