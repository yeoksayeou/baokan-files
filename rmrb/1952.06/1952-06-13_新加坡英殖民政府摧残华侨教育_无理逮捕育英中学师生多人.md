Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th: British imperialists continue to destroy overseas Chinese education in Malaya, and recently have unreasonably arrested large numbers of teachers and students from overseas Chinese schools. According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore on May 27, 125 British armed colonial police surrounded and searched Yuk Eng Middle School, an overseas Chinese school in Singapore, on the 27th, and arrested eight overseas Chinese teachers and twenty-seven students, including three female teachers and five female students. British colonial police also searched the homes of many students. Bryce, the head of the Special Branch of the Singapore British colonial government, arrogantly declared that he would interrogate the unreasonably arrested teachers and students. Bryce admitted that this was the second time the British colonial government had surrounded and searched Yuk Eng Middle School and unreasonably arrested teachers and students from the school.

Overseas Chinese who have returned to China from Malaya in Beijing expressed great anger after hearing this news.

    新加坡英殖民政府摧残华侨教育
    无理逮捕育英中学师生多人
    【新华社十二日讯】英帝国主义者继续摧残马来亚华侨教育，最近又无理地大批拘捕华侨学校的教师和学生。据路透社新加坡五月二十七日电透露：英国武装殖民警察一百二十五人在二十七日包围搜查了新加坡的华侨学校育英中学，捕去华侨教师八人和学生二十七人，其中包括女教师三人、女学生五人。英国殖民警察同时并到许多学生的家里进行搜查。新加坡英国殖民政府的特务头子特别部主任布莱斯蛮横无理地扬言将对那些被无理逮捕的师生进行讯问。布莱斯承认，这已是英国殖民政府包围搜查育英中学、无理拘捕该校师生的第二次。
    在北京的马来亚归国华侨听到这消息后，都表示极大愤怒。
