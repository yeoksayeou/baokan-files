Why We Treated Zhang Shunyou with the Wrong Attitude

Li Weizhi, Head of the Readers' Letters Group of Shanxi Daily, Editor Huo Chengxun

In handling the visit of Zhang Shunyou, a carter from the Second District of Guoxian County, we two committed an inexcusable bureaucratic error. Our self-criticism is as follows:

Our error is serious (the facts are detailed in the self-criticism of the Shanxi Daily Editorial Department). The reason why it is serious is mainly because: this visit to the newspaper office by carter Zhang Shunyou occurred after he had gone through many organs in three provinces and was obstructed by bureaucrats everywhere. Our newspaper is a bridge connecting with the masses, and readers' letters and visits are one of the basic ways for the newspaper to connect with the masses. And we two are the main staff directly dealing with readers' letters and visits. Our indifference to carter Zhang Shunyou's visit directly struck at the enthusiasm of the people in participating in national construction, seriously damaged the prestige of the newspaper, and affected the close connection between the newspaper and the Party, the government, and the people.

The occurrence of this error was not accidental, but just a more prominent case among our many bureaucratic errors. Why did this error occur? There are three main reasons:

First, our mass viewpoint is weak. This is a matter of Party spirit, that is to say: we still lack the feelings of the working class, we don't understand the suffering of the working people, and we don't care enough about the specific problems of workers and peasants. Especially after entering the city, under the erosion of bourgeois ideology, our emotional connection with the working people has become more distant. Therefore, regarding Zhang Shunyou's visit, although Wu Zhendong reported to editor Huo Chengxun (Li Weizhi, the group leader at the time, was also present), and said, "This person doesn't trust the Party and the government and insists on going to Beijing to find Chairman Mao," it did not arouse our attention. We also suspected: "Could it be that dozens of organs have such serious bureaucracy?" So we put this matter out of our minds and never thought about it again. How weak is our mass concept!

Second, we lack a deep understanding of newspapers and the work of readers' letters in newspapers. Newspapers should represent public opinion and supervise various tasks, and readers' letters and visits, which expose the errors and shortcomings of staff members in large quantities, are precisely one of the concrete methods to realize this mass supervision. But we lack sufficient understanding of this point. We have not paid enough attention to the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals." Therefore, we cannot boldly handle the problems raised by readers after investigation and research, but mostly adopt a perfunctory and bureaucratic attitude, pushing them to Party and government departments for investigation and handling. The handling of Zhang Shunyou's problem also illustrates this point. At that time, we believed that if the provincial people's government could not solve Zhang Shunyou's travel expenses and wages, how could we handle it? This matter involves several provinces, and it would be useless for the Shanxi Daily to publish it. Because of this kind of thinking, we simply did not pay attention to this issue.

News work is mass work, and the readers' letters department is a department that directly contacts the masses. Therefore, it is very important to be vigilant against bureaucracy. However, we are not clear about this in our consciousness, and we have never seriously fought against bureaucratic ideas. Therefore, bureaucracy has grown, so that in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we still treated Zhang Shunyou's visit with a bureaucratic attitude, and the error is even more unforgivable.

Third, we have serious liberalism. We usually do not study the important issues raised by readers sufficiently, and we do not consult or report to the editor-in-chief's office enough. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed us long ago to report the situation of readers' letters and the problems raised in a timely manner, but we have never implemented this instruction. This is an unorganized and undisciplined behavior.

In the future, we must further strengthen our Party spirit, strengthen the mass viewpoint, thoroughly overcome bureaucracy, and resolutely strive to be true people's journalists. We are willing to accept the disciplinary action given to us by the Party.

Correction

In the last line of the article "A Farm Family's Tragi-Comedy" on page three of this newspaper on June 17, the "twenty years" in "Bao Tonghua gave birth to Guan Yin twenty years ago" should be "twelve years."

    我们为什么会用错误态度对待张顺有
    山西日报读者来信组组长  李蔚芝  编辑  霍成勋
    我们两人在处理崞县二区赶车工人张顺有的来访问题时，犯了不能令人容忍的官僚主义错误。现检讨如下：
    我们的错误是严重的（事实经过见山西日报编辑部的检讨）。其所以严重，主要在于：赶车工人张顺有这次到报馆来谈话是已经走过三个省许多个机关，到处都受到了官僚主义者的阻难之后。我们的报纸是联系群众的桥梁，读者来信和来访工作又是报纸联系群众的基本方式之一。而我们两人则是直接处理读者来信和来访的主要工作人员。我们对赶车工人张顺有的来访竟置之不理，直接打击了人民群众参加国家建设工作的积极性，严重破坏了报纸的威信，影响了报纸及党、政府和人民群众的密切联系。
    这一错误的发生不是偶然的，只不过是我们的许多官僚主义错误中比较突出的一件罢了。为什么会产生这种错误呢？主要有以下三个原因：
    首先是我们的群众观点薄弱。这是一个党性问题，也就是说：我们尚缺乏工人阶级的感情，对劳动群众的疾苦不了解，对工人、农民的具体问题不够关心。特别是进城以后，在资产阶级思想侵蚀下，和劳动人民的感情联系更加疏远。因此，对于张顺有来访，吴振东虽向编辑霍成勋（当时组长李蔚芝也在场）作了汇报，并说：“这个人对党和政府都不相信，一定要到北京找毛主席”，但却没有引起我们的重视。我们并怀疑：“是不是几十个机关都有那么严重的官僚主义？”于是就把这件事置于脑后，再不去考虑它了。我们的群众观念是何等薄弱呀！
    二、对报纸以及报纸的读者来信工作缺乏深刻认识。报纸应代表舆论对各种工作实行监督，而读者来信和来访，大量揭发工作人员的错误和缺点，正是具体实现这种群众性的监督的方法之一。但我们对这点认识不足。我们对中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”重视不够，因此，对读者提出的问题，不能经过调查研究大胆地处理，而多是采取敷衍塞责的官僚主义态度，推到党和政府部门去调查处理。对张顺有问题的处理，也正说明了这个问题。当时我们曾认为张顺有的路费和工资问题，省人民政府还解决不了，我们怎能处理；这事情是好几省的问题，山西日报刊登也不顶事。正因为有这种思想，所以我们便根本没有对这问题加以重视。
    新闻工作即是群众工作，而读者来信部门更是直接和群众发生联系的部门，因此警惕官僚主义是十分重要的。但是对于这一点，我们在意识上是不明确的，始终没有向官僚主义思想作过严肃斗争。因此官僚主义便滋长起来，以致在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，仍然以官僚主义的态度来对待张顺有的来访，其错误更不可饶恕。
    三、我们有严重的自由主义。我们平素对读者提出的重要问题研究不够，向总编室请示、汇报也不够。中共山西省委很早以前即指示我们：要经常及时地汇报读者来信情况和提出的问题，但我们始终没有执行这一指示。这是一种无组织无纪律的行为。
    今后我们要进一步锻炼我们的党性，加强群众观点，彻底克服官僚主义，坚决争取做一个真正的人民新闻工作者。我们愿意接受党给我们的纪律处分。更正
