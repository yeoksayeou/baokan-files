    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th - After the US Chief Representative, Harrison, unilaterally interrupted the normal course of negotiations on the 7th and proposed a three-day recess, in order to insist on the normal progress of the meeting, our liaison officer notified the other party's liaison officer on the morning of the 8th, requesting that the other party's representatives come to the meeting at 11:00 am. However, the other party's liaison officer, Mu Lai, replied: "On the order of the Chief Representative, I inform your side: Unless there are special circumstances requiring an earlier meeting that can make definite progress towards the armistice, we do not agree to meet before June 11th." On the 9th and 10th, our side repeatedly urged the other party's representatives to come to the meeting, but the other party's liaison officer repeatedly repeated this rogue argument. Relevant departments of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation stated to a Xinhua News Agency reporter regarding this matter:
    The reason why the armistice negotiations cannot progress at present is entirely due to the US side's insistence on the unreasonable plan to detain our prisoners of war and therefore refusing to reason and negotiate. As long as the US side changes this attitude, the meeting can make progress. Now the US side is putting forward this rogue argument, making demands on the requirement that the meeting should proceed normally, which is not allowed, and it is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of equal treatment between the two sides. Apart from exposing the US side's unwillingness to resolve the issue through consultation and deliberately delaying or even sabotaging the negotiations, it will not have any other result.
    The only excuse for the US side to interrupt the normal course of the meeting is that our side is using the meeting for hypocritical propaganda, which is a complete lie. What our side has revealed in the meeting is only simple facts. Is it not a fact that the US side is detaining a large number of our captured personnel in the name of "voluntary repatriation"? Is it not a fact that the US side's position on the prisoner of war issue completely violates the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention? Is it not a fact that the US side has taken all kinds of atrocities against our captured personnel - massacres, tattooing, food deprivation, forced writing of blood letters, torture and abuse, etc.? Is it not a fact that our side has made many major efforts on the issue of prisoners of war, while the US side has not made any concessions? Is it not a fact that the US side itself has overturned its promise to resolve the issue within the outline of our March 21st principle suggestion? The meeting should be a place for both sides to reason and negotiate based on facts, but the US side has repeatedly refused to answer questions and refused to reason and negotiate in the meeting, and after doing so, it casually suspends the normal course of negotiations. This fully demonstrates the US side's lack of reason and its fear of facing facts and truth.
    The US side is trying to force our side to accept its unreasonable plan of April 28th by suspending the normal course of the meeting. The relevant departments emphasized that the US side's attempt will not work and will definitely suffer a complete failure. What the US side cannot get on the battlefield by force will not be obtained in the meeting by means of threats and coercion, not only will it not be obtained now, but it will certainly not be obtained in the future. In this meeting, all issues must be resolved on a fair and reasonable basis, and only on a fair and reasonable basis can they be resolved. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation will insist on the normal progress of the meeting and insist on resolving the only remaining unresolved issue hindering the armistice through consultation on the basis of our fair and reasonable plan of May 2nd, in order to strive for the early realization of peace in Korea. Now, the future of the Korean armistice depends entirely on whether the US side has sincerity.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th - Relevant departments of our delegation pointed out to a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the US side's three-day absence from the meeting is a new development in the US side's behavior of sabotaging the negotiations, stating:
    Since our side put forward a reasonable compromise plan for resolving the remaining issues at the Korean armistice negotiation meeting on May 2nd, the US side has created a series of unreasonable provocations in an attempt to force the Korean and Chinese people to submit and accept its April 28th plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel by despicable means of intimidation. This makes it certain that the provocative act of the US Chief Representative Harrison on June 7th, who insisted on a three-day recess and unreasonably walked out of the meeting without mutual agreement, was by no means accidental.
    First, the US side attacked their own captured personnel. On May 4th and 5th, the US side continuously strafed and bombed our Changcheng prisoner of war camp, which had obvious markings, with military aircraft. After our side urged them to pay serious attention, on May 11th, US aircraft strafed our Jiangdong prisoner of war camp, which had obvious markings, in broad daylight, and four prisoners of war were seriously injured by the US side's own bullets. Immediately afterwards, on May 12th, US aircraft strafed our delegation's supply truck with red flag markings on the highway from Pyongyang to Kaesong, and Li Dongzhu, a staff member of our delegation who was working for the Korean armistice, was killed by the US side's sinful bullets. Only two days after this incident, on May 14th at 2:00 am, US military aircraft invaded the Kaesong neutral zone, hovered at low altitude for 55 minutes, dropped a large number of flares and strafed. On June 5th, the US side took the provocative behavior to the extreme and moved it to the Panmunjom meeting area, shelling the meeting area with a radius of 1,000 yards for half an hour before the meeting. The US shrapnel exploded on the northern edge of the meeting area, and the shrapnel killed three residents in the meeting area. This more nakedly exposed what the US side's so-called "goodwill and sincerity" is.
    Obviously, the US side does not understand that what cannot be obtained on the battlefield cannot be obtained in the meeting, let alone by these despicable means of intimidation. The Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world will never be agitated by these provocative actions of the US side and shake their confidence in striving for the Korean armistice. These shameless acts of the US side can only make the people of the world more clearly recognize the US side's conspiracy to break the negotiations and expand the war of aggression.

### 我方代表团有关方面发表谈话  痛斥美方破坏停战谈判的卑怯挑衅行动

    我方代表团有关方面发表谈话
    痛斥美方破坏停战谈判的卑怯挑衅行动
    【新华社开城十一日电】在美方首席代表哈利逊七日片面中断谈判的正常进行而提出休会三日后，为了坚持会议的正常进行，我方联络官于八日晨通知对方联络官，要求对方代表于十一时前来开会，但对方联络官穆莱竟答称：“奉首席代表之命通知你方：除非有特殊情况必须更早召开能向停战作确定进展的会议，我们不同意在六月十一日以前开会。”九日、十日，我方连续敦促对方代表前来开会，但对方联络官竟一再重复这个无赖论调。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团有关方面特就此事向新华社记者谈称：
    停战谈判目前之所以不能进展完全是由于美方坚持扣留我方战俘的无理方案并因此而拒绝说理，拒绝协商所致。只要美方改变他们这种态度，会议是可以有进展的。现在美方提出这种无赖论调，对会议应当正常进行的要求提出要挟，这是不能容许的，这与双方平等对待的原则根本不相符合。它除了暴露美方无意协商解决问题、蓄意拖延甚至破坏谈判以外，不会有任何其他结果。
    美方中断会议正常进行的唯一藉口，是说我方利用会议进行虚伪的宣传，这是彻头彻尾的撒谎。我方在会议中所揭露的只是简单的事实。难道说美方利用“自愿遣返”为名扣留我方大批被俘人员不是事实吗？难道说美方扣留战俘的立场完全违反了一九四九年日内瓦公约的规定不是事实吗？难道说美方对我方被俘人员所采取的种种暴行——屠杀、刺字、绝粮、迫写血书、酷刑虐待等不是事实吗？难道说在战俘问题上我方曾经作了多次重大的努力，而美方则丝毫未作任何让步不是事实吗？难道说美方自己推翻其在我方三月二十一日原则建议的轮廓内解决问题的诺言不是事实吗？会议应当是双方根据事实进行说理协商的场所，美方却在会内一再拒绝回答问题，拒绝说理协商，并且在这样作了之后，又随随便便中止谈判的正常进行，这完全说明了美方的理屈词穷，不敢面对事实和真理。
    美方妄想借中止会议的正常进行来压迫我方接受其四月二十八日的无理方案。有关方面强调称，美方这种企图是行不通的，它一定会遭受彻底的失败。美方在会场外用武力得不到的东西，在会场内用威胁压迫的办法同样也得不到，不但现在得不到，将来也一定得不到。在这个会议当中，一切问题必须在公平合理的基础上，也只有在公平合理的基础上才能获得解决。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团将坚持会议的正常进行，并坚持在我方五月二日公平合理方案的基础上，经过协商方式，解决阻碍停战的唯一剩余的未决问题，以争取朝鲜和平的早日实现。现在，朝鲜停战的前途，完全要看美方是否具有诚意而定。
    【新华社开城十一日电】我方代表团有关方面向新华社记者指出美方逃会三日是美方破坏谈判的行为的一个新发展称：
    自五月二日我方在朝鲜停战谈判会议上提出了解决剩余问题的合理折衷方案以后，美方就制造了一连串的无理寻衅事件，企图用卑劣的恐吓手段，迫使朝中人民屈服，接受其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的四月二十八日方案。这就使人确信，六月七日美方首席代表哈利逊在会议上未经双方协议、坚持休会三天并无理退席的挑衅举动，决不是偶然的。
    首先，美方对他们自己的被俘人员下了毒手。五月四日、五日两天内，美方连续以军用飞机对我方设有明显标志的昌城俘虏营进行了扫射与轰炸。在我方促其严重注意之后，五月十一日美机又在光天化日之下扫射了我方设有明显标志的江东俘虏营，四名战俘就在美方自己的子弹下受了重伤。紧接着，美方飞机又在五月十二日在平壤到开城的公路上扫射了我方代表团的有红旗标志的供应卡车，以致为朝鲜停战而奔走的我方代表团工作人员李东洙在美方罪恶的子弹下牺牲。这一事件之后，仅仅隔了两天，五月十四日上午二时，美方军用飞机又侵入开城中立区，低空盘旋了五十五分钟之久，投掷了大批照明弹并进行扫射。六月五日，美方更登峰造极地将挑衅行为搬到板门店会场区，在大会举行之前，向半径一千码的会场区炮击半小时之久。美方的榴霰弹在会场区北缘爆炸，弹片杀伤了会场区内的居民三人。这就更加赤裸裸地暴露了美方的所谓“善良诚意”究竟是什么东西。
    显然，美方并不了解：在战场上得不到的东西，在会议中是同样得不到的，更不是用这些卑怯的恐吓手段所能得到的。朝中人民与全世界人民，也决不会被美方这些挑衅行为所激动，而动摇了争取朝鲜停战的信心。美方的这些无耻行为，只能使全世界人民更加认清美方企图破裂谈判并扩大侵略战争的阴谋而已。
