The work of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method in railways across the country has achieved great success. Eighty-seven major stations across the country have implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, and sixteen major stations are currently testing it; 470 shunting teams have fully adopted the Li Xikui shunting method. After the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method, the stopping time of trains on railways across the country has been shortened, and transportation efficiency has been significantly improved. In January of this year, the average time for assembling trains nationwide was 37.8 minutes, and in April, it was 26.4 minutes; the efficiency of assembling trains in April increased by 30% compared to January. In January of this year, the average time for dismantling trains nationwide was 29.7 minutes, and in April, it was 21.5 minutes; the efficiency of dismantling trains in April increased by 27% compared to January. This has strengthened the country's transportation capacity.

The reason why the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method has achieved such remarkable results is mainly because leading cadres at all levels have strengthened ideological leadership and criticized conservative and departmentalist ideologies; labor models in various regions have taken the lead in implementation, breaking through various ideological concerns in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method. In August of last year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government officially issued a notice ordering all regions to learn the Li Xikui shunting method. In November of last year, a shunting study class was established at the Harbin Station, gathering labor models and shunters from major stations across the country to study the Li Xikui shunting method and other related shunting operation methods. Participants in the study class saw the advantages of the Li Xikui shunting method with their own eyes. This measure prepared the conditions for the large-scale promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method later on. At the beginning of this year, the people who participated in the shunting study class returned to their posts and took the lead in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, which achieved great results. Some station masters of the Qiqihar Railway Administration previously had departmentalist ideas and were unwilling to promote the Li Xikui shunting method; because this erroneous idea was criticized, and labor model Cui Xiufeng took the lead in implementing it, the stations of this bureau actively implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, increasing shunting efficiency by a quarter.

However, the current work of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method is still uneven. From a national perspective, the China Changchun Railway Administration has done a better job in promoting it, and 78 shunting teams in the entire bureau have obtained the "Implement Li Xikui Shunting Method" qualification certificate. After fully implementing the Li Xikui shunting method, the shunting efficiency of the China Changchun Railway Administration increased by 62%. After criticizing erroneous ideas, the Qiqihar Railway Administration also did a better job in promoting it. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration and the Hengyang Railway Administration have done a poor job in promoting it. Currently, only a few stations in these two bureaus are testing the Li Xikui shunting method. Some station masters and transportation directors of these two bureaus emphasize "poor equipment" and "low employee skills," and dare not boldly promote the Li Xikui shunting method. When the masses of workers consciously rise up to implement the Li Xikui shunting method, they do not actively lead, but instead say: "Too risky!" This erroneous idea must be overcome.

In order to deeply promote the Li Xikui shunting method, the Tianjin Railway Administration recently convened cadres and shunters from various stations to discuss how to further promote the Li Xikui shunting method in the future. This method can be adopted by various regions. The joint labor organizations of the train operations, vehicle inspection, and locomotive departments must be strengthened and consolidated to overcome the phenomenon of each department acting on its own and not coordinating with each other, and attention should be paid to the ideological education of collectivism. The dispatching offices and stations should strengthen contact, make correct station daily shift plans, and guide on-site work.

    全国八十七个主要车站推行李锡奎调车法 
    郑州铁路管理局和衡阳铁路管理局某些单位的领导干部保守思想严重，还只有少数车站试行李锡奎调车法
    全国铁路推广李锡奎调车法的工作，已获得很大的成绩。全国已有八十七个主要车站推行了李锡奎调车法，有十六个主要车站正在试行中；有四百七十个调车组完全采用了李锡奎调车法。在推广李锡奎调车法以后，全国铁路列车停站时间已经缩短，运输效率显著提高。今年一月份全国编组列车时间平均为三十七点八分钟，四月份平均为二十六点四分钟；四月比一月的编组列车效率提高了百分之三十。今年一月份全国解体列车时间平均为二十九点七分钟，四月份平均为二十一点五分钟；四月比一月解体列车效率提高了百分之二十七。这样，就增强了国家运输的力量。
    推广李锡奎调车法工作所以能有这样显著的成绩，主要是因为各级领导干部加强了思想领导，批判了保守主义思想和本位主义思想；各地劳动模范积极带头实行，打破了推广李锡奎调车法的各种思想顾虑。去年八月中央人民政府铁道部正式发出通知，命令各地学习李锡奎调车法。去年十一月，在哈尔滨车站成立了调车学习班，调集了全国主要车站的劳动模范、调车员，学习李锡奎调车法和其他有关调车的作业方法。参加学习的人在学习班中亲眼看到了李锡奎调车法的优越性。这一措施为以后大规模推广李锡奎调车法准备了条件。今年年初，参加调车学习班的人都回到了自己的岗位，带头推行李锡奎调车法，收到了很大的效果。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局有些站长过去有本位主义思想，不愿意推广李锡奎调车法；由于批评了这种错误思想，劳动模范崔秀峰又带头实行，这个局的车站纷纷实行李锡奎调车法，把调车效率提高了四分之一。
    但是，目前推广李锡奎调车法的工作还是不平衡的。从全国范围看来，中长铁路管理局推广得较好，全局有七十八个调车组得到了“贯彻李锡奎调车法”的合格证。在全面推行李锡奎调车法以后，中长铁路管理局的调车效率提高了百分之六十二。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局批判了错误思想以后，推广工作也做得较好。郑州铁路管理局和衡阳铁路管理局推广得较差。现在，这两个局还只有少数车站在试行李锡奎调车法。这两个局的某些车站站长、运转主任强调“设备不好”“员工技术低”，不敢大胆推行李锡奎调车法。当工人群众自觉地起来实行李锡奎调车法的时候，他们不积极领导，反而说：“太冒险！”这种错误思想，必须注意克服。
    为了深入地推广李锡奎调车法，最近天津铁路管理局召集各车站干部和调车员开会，研究今后怎样进一步推广李锡奎调车法。这个方法，各地可以采用。车务、检车、机务等部门的联合劳动组织，必须加强和巩固起来，克服各自为政互不协调的现象，注意集体主义的思想教育。调度所和车站应加强联系，做出正确的车站日班计划，指导现场工作。
