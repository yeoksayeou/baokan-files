    Learning the Spirit of Huang Runping in Creating New Warehouse Management Methods
    The people's factories are institutions for large-scale production for the people. Every department of the factory should be closely integrated and consistently serve production. The basic production unit of the factory is the workshop, and all other departments should be oriented towards the workshop in order to serve production through the workshop. However, the situation in many of our factories is not entirely like this. The organization of some factories is still relatively loose, and there are disconnections and confusion between departments. Workshops engage in production, warehouses take charge of storage, materials departments conduct procurement, and finance departments manage disbursement. They blindly carry out their business operations according to past rules, either without contact with each other or with very little contact, leading to loopholes that affect production and waste the wealth of the state. Now, Huang Runping, a worker at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, has created a new warehouse management method (see page two of today's newspaper). This is one of the effective methods to overcome the above-mentioned disconnection phenomenon.
    The characteristic of Huang Runping's warehouse management method is that it has changed the blind, old working method of "I receive goods when you send them; I issue materials as you request," and consciously orients itself towards the workshop, actively serving production. According to the needs of production and based on the principle of economy, he mastered the material consumption schedule, promoted substitutes and reprocessed products to the workshop, and implemented a system of exchange and transfer of tools and materials. The management method created by Huang Runping closely integrates production and supply, ensuring that the workshop obtains sufficient and appropriate raw materials, and turning the "reject warehouse" into a "reprocessed product warehouse," saving the state many useful resources.
    Why was Huang Runping able to create this new management method? This is because he discovered and mastered the laws of warehouse work. He understands that the warehouse should be oriented towards the workshop and serve production. He understands that the needs of the workshop are very complex, and that raw materials are diverse. Therefore, it is entirely possible to implement the adjustment of raw materials and tools within the entire factory and to adopt some substitutes. He understands that all workers are willing to use good materials, and that workers have a very high ability to identify raw materials. Therefore, he asked experienced workers to help inspect raw materials, which made the workers very satisfied. He understands that warehouse management, without a set of scientific rules, can easily lead the entire work into a state of chaos and passivity. Therefore, he has formulated a set of practical rules according to the needs of the work, and implemented a specialized management method, which has improved the working ability and confidence of warehouse cadres.
    Huang Runping's experience has educated some people who emphasize personal interests and are unwilling to take on specific business work. These people believe that some jobs are interesting to them, while others are meaningless. They are willing to take on interesting jobs, but unwilling to take on meaningless ones. This view is obviously wrong. As the old saying goes, "Every profession produces its own leading authority." As long as you work hard, you can discover and master the laws of work in various departments. And the only way to discover and master the laws of work is to connect with reality, connect with the masses, not be afraid of difficulties, and learn with an open mind. Huang Runping was newly promoted to deputy section chief of the warehouse. Initially, he had neither experience nor confidence in his work. But this situation quickly changed. Under the encouragement and help of the Party, he began a difficult learning process. He studied various problems in practice and came up with solutions on the principle of being beneficial to the Party's cause and to production. In this way, in just three months, he went from a novice in warehouse work to an expert in warehouse work.
    In the "Three-Anti" movement, a large number of workers were promoted to leadership positions, and they have already played a huge role. However, some leading cadres still ignore these new forces, and some newly promoted worker cadres still lack the necessary confidence. Now, countless facts are teaching us: worker cadres are the most loyal to the people's cause, they are familiar with production conditions, and they have close ties with the masses. As long as we strengthen leadership and help them, and as long as they work hard to learn, then they will quickly become excellent cadres.

### 学习黄润萍创造仓库新管理法的精神

    学习黄润萍创造仓库新管理法的精神
    人民的工厂是为人民进行大规模生产的机关。工厂的任何部门，都应该紧密结合，一致为生产服务。工厂的基本生产单位是车间，其他各个部门，都应该面向车间，以便通过车间，为生产服务。但是，我国许多工厂的情况还不完全是这样的。有些工厂的组织还比较涣散，各部门之间有脱节的、混乱的现象。车间从事生产，仓库担任保管，材料部门进行采购，财务部门管理出纳，它们按照过去的规矩，盲目地进行自己的业务工作，或者互不联系，或者很少联系，以致发生漏洞，影响了生产，浪费了国家的财富。现在，华北农业机械总厂的工人黄润萍，创造了新仓库管理法（见今日本报第二版）。这是克服上述脱节现象的有效方法之一。
    黄润萍管理仓库方法的特点是改变了盲目的“你来货，我就收；你领料，我照发”的旧的工作方法，自觉地面向车间，主动地为生产服务。他按照生产的需要，根据节约的原则，掌握了用料进度计划，向车间推广代用品和再制品，并实行了工具、材料的交流和调拨制度。黄润萍创造的这种管理方法，把生产和供应紧密地结合起来，保证车间源源取得足够的、适当的原材料，把“废品库”变成“再制品库”，为国家节约了许多有用的资财。
    黄润萍为什么能够创造出这种新的管理方法呢？这是因为他发现并掌握了仓库工作的规律。他懂得仓库要面向车间，为生产服务。他懂得车间的需要是很复杂的，而原材料是多种多样的，因此，在整个工厂范围内实行原材料和工具的调剂，采用一部分代用品，是完全可能办到的。他懂得所有的工人都愿意用好料，而工人鉴别原材料的能力是很高的，因此，他请有经验的工人帮助验收原材料，工人十分满意。他懂得仓库的管理，如果没有一套科学的制度，很容易使整个工作陷于混乱、被动的状态，因此，他根据工作的需要，制订了一套切实可行的制度，并实行了专业化的管理方法，这就提高了仓库干部的工作能力和信心。
    黄润萍的经验，教育了某些强调个人的兴趣而不愿意担任具体业务工作的人。这些人认为某些工作对于他是有兴趣的，某些工作却是没有意思的。他们愿意担任有兴趣的工作，而不愿意担任没有意思的工作。这种看法显然是错误的。古语说“行行出状元”，只要自己努力，就可以发现和掌握各部门工作的规律。而发现和掌握工作规律的唯一法门，就是联系实际、联系群众、不怕困难、虚心学习。黄润萍新被提拔为仓库副股长，他最初对工作既没有经验，也缺乏信心。但这种情况很快就改变过来了。在党的鼓励、帮助之下，他开始了艰苦的学习。他研究实际中的各种问题，并在有利于党的事业、有利于生产的原则下，想出解决的办法。这样，在短短的三个月间，他就从一个仓库工作的生手，变成一个仓库工作的行家了。
    在“三反”运动中，大批工人被提拔到领导岗位上来，他们已经发挥了巨大的作用。但是，有些领导干部还忽视这些新生的力量，有些新被提拔的工人干部，也还缺乏应有的信心。现在无数的事实都教导着我们：工人干部对于人民事业是最忠诚的，他们熟悉生产情况，和群众有密切的联系，只要对他们加强领导和帮助，只要他们自己努力学习，那末，他们很快就会变成优秀的干部。
