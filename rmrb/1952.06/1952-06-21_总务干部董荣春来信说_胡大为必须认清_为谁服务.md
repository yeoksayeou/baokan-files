    General Affairs Cadre Dong Rongchun Writes:
    Hu Dawei Must Recognize "Whom to Serve"
    Comrade Editor: In the revolutionary camp, various tasks need to be specifically divided. General affairs work is an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary work. If any department lacks general affairs work, or if the general affairs work is not done well, the lives of all staff members will not be guaranteed, and the work will be affected. Therefore, this work is very important.
    Is general affairs work "trivial," "tedious," or "without prospects"? I do not agree with Comrade Hu Dawei's view. The reason he has such a wrong understanding is that he has not yet resolved the fundamental question of "whom to serve." Since general affairs work is a part of revolutionary work, and since it is work related to the lives and health of revolutionary staff members, then how can working for the lives and health of one's comrades be "without prospects"? Must meticulous and thoughtful work be "cumbersome" and "tedious"? Obviously, Comrade Hu Dawei is not proceeding from the interests and needs of the revolution, but is detached from the interests of the revolution to seek his own so-called development and interests, which is completely wrong.
    I have been doing general affairs work in the Administrative Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for more than three years. At first, I also had the same thoughts as Comrade Hu Dawei, but in my actual work, those thoughts have gradually been corrected. I often do the work of receiving labor models, and I am very interested in this work. Labor models are the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland, and they should be warmly received when they come to Beijing. I recognize the important significance of this work, so I always try my best to receive them in all specific and small tasks. They feel a sense of familiarity and warmth, and I also feel the joy of work. I have never felt that this work is "without prospects" or that I "can't hold my head up in front of others." I hope that Comrade Hu Dawei and other comrades with this kind of thinking will deeply examine their own thoughts, establish a revolutionary viewpoint of serving the people, and then this problem can be solved. Dong Rongchun

    总务干部董荣春来信说
    胡大为必须认清“为谁服务”
    编辑同志：在革命阵营中，各种工作是需要实行具体分工的。总务工作是整个革命工作中不可缺少的一部分，任何一个部门，如果没有总务工作，或者说总务工作没有作好，全体工作人员的生活就没有保证，工作也就要受到影响。因此，这个工作是十分重要的。
    总务工作是不是“琐碎”、“枯燥”或“没有出息”的工作呢？我不同意胡大为同志的看法。他所以产生了这种错误的认识，是因为他还没有解决
    “为谁服务”的根本问题。总务工作既然是革命工作的一部分，既然是有关革命工作人员的生活和健康的工作，那末，为自己的同志的生活和健康而工作，怎么是“没有出息”呢？难道必须细致、周到的工作，就是“繁琐”和“枯燥”么？显然胡大为同志不是从革命利益和需要出发，而是脱离了革命的利益，来寻求个人的所谓发展和兴趣，这是完全错误的。
    我在中华全国总工会行政处作总务工作，已经三年多了。起初也曾有过胡大为同志那种思想，但在实际工作中，那种思想已逐渐纠正了。我常做招待劳动模范的工作，我对这个工作很有兴趣。劳动模范是祖国的优秀儿女，他们来到北京，应该受到热情的招待。我认识了这个工作的重要意义，所以在一切具体、细小的工作中总是想尽一切办法来招待他们。他们感觉到亲切和温暖，我也就感到了工作的愉快。我从来没有感到这个工作“没有出息”，或者“在别人面前抬不起头来”。我希望胡大为同志以及有这种思想的同志们，深刻地检查自己的思想，树立为人民服务的革命观点，那么，这个问题就可以解决了。董荣春
