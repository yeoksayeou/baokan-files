    A Happy Family Destroyed by American Bacteriological Warfare
    Shao Hua

    On February 17, 1952, Fu Jinhua, wife of Yan Zongyao, a worker in the casting workshop of the Shenyang No. 4 Machinery Factory, was about to visit her parents' home. Her parents' home was in Ciyuzha Village, Liaozhong County, western Liaoning. That day, her five-year-old daughter, Xiao Lijun, was particularly happy. What a joyful thing it was for a child to wear new clothes and go to grandma's house! But her mother was not hurrying to the station; she was talking to her father. Her father said:

    "Stay at home for a few days, and bring back all the usable furniture when you return. Let's settle down here. The government is taking such good care of us, giving us good housing, and our salaries are increasing day by day. We can settle down here and produce well. Also," the child's father said, "if there are villagers who want to work in the factory, you can ask them to come..."

    Jinhua said, "They may not come! Everyone has their own land to cultivate, and they live quite well. It is not easy for farmers to leave their homes."

    The child's father said, "Don't you know? More and more factories are opening in our cities, and they need so many workers! Mutual aid teams have been organized in the countryside, which can free up manpower to work in factories. You can try to persuade them."

    Yan Zongyao was originally a farmer himself. He came to work in the factory at the end of the year before last. Being a worker is too good, and he always wanted to ask his friends in the countryside to work in the factory as well.

    After the couple said some other things, Xiao Lijun urged them several times, and they finally took her little hand and went to the station.

    After Yan Zongyao sent his wife and daughter on the train, he returned home. The clock on the table struck seven times, indicating it was getting dark. Every morning, his wife would wake him up for work, but the clock's chimes often failed to rouse him. Now, he took the clock to his next-door neighbor, worker Lang Yupu's house, and said to Lang Yupu's wife, "Sister Lang, please wake me up at 5:30 tomorrow morning. I sleep too soundly, don't let me be late for work."

    Sister Lang said with a smile, "Don't worry, I certainly won't let you be late."

    The next morning at 5:30, Sister Lang went to wake him up as scheduled, but he was already up and getting ready for work.

    After that, Sister Lang woke him up for work every morning, and he never overslept again.

    On February 29th, after American imperialist planes scattered bacteriological insects over Fushun, Shenyang, and other places, many strange insects were found in the Tiexi District of Shenyang City, including flies, mosquitoes, black beetles, ants, centipedes, spiders, butterflies, and ticks. They were everywhere: on the streets, in factories, in dormitories, on rooftops, and on windows. Worker Guo Liyong found more than two thousand flies in a small area on the roof of the factory building.

    On the morning of March 5th, Yan Zongyao felt unwell as soon as he started work. He went to the factory clinic and asked Dr. Zhang Yuzeng to examine him, but no illness was found. When asked what was wrong, he said, "My arms feel like they are cramping." Dr. Zhang immediately wrote him a referral letter, asking him to go to the Tiexi Workers' Hospital for examination. He took the referral letter, but he did not go to the Workers' Hospital; he went back to work. He felt that his body was very strong and had never suffered from any illness. A slight headache or fever was nothing to a young man of twenty-six. Going to the Workers' Hospital would require taking leave, and taking leave would mean missing work. He had been in the factory for almost two years and had never missed a day of work. Moreover, it was during the production competition to welcome "May Day." He had an ideal: he wanted to strive to be a model worker. So he didn't go.

    He worked hard for a day. The next day, March 6th, he went to work again. Although he felt a bit of a headache and a fever, he still believed that his body could resist all diseases.

    On the morning of the 7th, after the clock struck five times, Sister Lang went to knock on Yan Zongyao's door again. He answered from inside, his voice very soft and muddled. Sister Lang thought he had gotten up and didn't pay much attention, so she went back to her own house.

    But Yan Zongyao did not go to work that day. After work in the evening, Tang Shaojin, a worker in his team, said, "Why didn't Yan Zongyao come to work today? He never misses work, and he didn't ask for leave today..." So Tang Shaojin and another worker came to his house. They knocked on the door for a long time, but no one answered. They opened the door and found him dead! Tang Shaojin quickly reported this unfortunate news to the factory, the hospital, and the police station, and sent a telegram to Yan Zongyao's wife, Fu Jinhua.

    The telegram was received by Fu Jinhua's father. He did not immediately tell his daughter. He was afraid that his daughter would be too sad. He only urged his daughter to return to Shenyang immediately. Fu Jinhua panicked; she didn't know what had happened. She hurriedly took Xiao Lijun on the train, and her father accompanied her.

    They got off the train in Shenyang and hurried towards their home. But the door to their house was sealed, and they could not enter. Sister Lang took them to her own home. At this time, Sister Lang told her, "Your husband died of a sudden illness!"

    Fu Jinhua felt cold all over, from head to toe. She had no strength at all. She couldn't stand steady. She fell down. She opened her mouth and cried out after a long time. It was like a dream; this happy life had just begun two years ago, but what on earth had happened?

    Xiao Lijun was only five years old and still a not very sensible child. She had never heard of death, and she didn't know what death was. She thought her father was at work and hadn't come home yet!

    She asked, "Will Daddy come back after he dies?" People told her:

    "He will never come back after he dies!" Before, every evening when Daddy came home from work, Mommy would bring up hot meals, and the family of three would eat and chat happily. On Sundays, Daddy would hold her and go to the store with Mommy to buy toys and candy. But Daddy would never come back, and she cried too!

    After Yan Zongyao was taken to the China Medical University, Professor Li Peilin of the Department of Pathology performed an autopsy and proved that he died of acute infectious encephalitis. This encephalitis is different from Japanese encephalitis B and has never occurred in China before. Considering the other encephalitis deaths that Professor Li has dissected and examined in succession, there is sufficient reason to believe that this is clearly the result of American imperialism's bacteriological warfare.

    Yan Zongyao, like the people of the whole country, lived a happy life. He was full of enthusiasm for production and full of lofty ideals for building a new China and beautiful personal hopes. But the American imperialists' bacteriological warfare destroyed his happy family and destroyed his hopes. When the news that Yan Zongyao had been killed by American imperialist bacteriological warfare reached the factory, a large-scale anti-bacteriological warfare movement and production movement unfolded simultaneously.

    被美国细菌战破坏了的一个幸福家庭
    韶华
    一九五二年二月十七日，沈阳机械四厂铸造车间工人严宗尧的妻子富金华要走娘家去了。她娘家在辽西辽中县茨榆垞村。这一天，五岁的女儿小丽君特别高兴。穿上新衣裳走姥姥家，对于一个孩子是多么幸福的事情呀！可是妈妈总是不快点上站，她在和爸爸说话呢。爸爸说：
    “你到家住几天，回来把那些可用的家具都带回来。咱们就算在这儿安家了。现在政府这样照顾咱们，给咱们好房子住，薪水又一天一天地提高，咱们在这安住家，就可以好好地生产了。还有，”孩子的爸爸又说：“咱们村里，要有愿意到工厂来工作的，也可以叫他们来……”
    金华说：“他们可不一定来呀！大家都有了自己的地种了，生活过得怪不错的。庄稼人离开家也不是容易的呀。”
    孩子的爸爸说：“你还不知道吗？咱们城市里开的工厂越来越多，需要多少工人哪！乡下组织了互助组，可以腾出人手到工厂来工作的。你动员动员他们。”
    严宗尧原来也是庄稼人，他是前年年底到工厂来工作的。当个工人太好了，他总想叫他在乡下的朋友也到工厂来工作。
    他们夫妇又说了一些别的话，小丽君又督促了几遍，他们才拉着她的小手到车站去了。
    严宗尧送妻子和女儿上火车之后，回到家里，桌上的座钟铛铛铛地敲了七下，天黑了。他每天早晨上班都是妻子招呼他起床，铛铛的钟声常常敲不醒他。现在，他抱着这个座钟走到隔壁邻居工人郎玉璞家里，对郎玉璞妻子说：“郎大嫂，明天早晨五点半钟你就招呼我起床，我睡得太死，别耽搁了上班。”
    郎大嫂笑着说：“你放心吧，一定不能耽误你上班。”
    第二天早上五点半钟，郎大嫂按时去招呼他，可是他已经起来准备上班了。
    以后郎大嫂每天早晨都招呼他上班，他哪一天也没有睡过死觉。
    二月二十九日，美帝国主义的飞机在抚顺、沈阳等地撒布了细菌昆虫之后，在沈阳市铁西区发现了许多奇怪的昆虫，有苍蝇，有蚊子，有黑盖虫，有蚂蚁，还有蜈蚣和蜘蛛，蝴蝶和壁虱。街道、工厂、宿舍，房顶上、窗户上到处都有。工人郭立永在厂房顶上不大的一块地方，竟发现了两千多个苍蝇。
    三月五日上午，严宗尧刚刚上班，就觉得身上不大舒服。他走到厂内的医务所，请张裕增医生检查了一下，没有发现什么病。问他怎么不舒服，他说：“两只胳臂好像抽筋似的。”张医生马上给他开了一封介绍信，叫他到铁西工人医院去检查。他拿了介绍信，但并没有到工人医院去，他又到现场工作去了。他觉得自己身体很好，从没有得过什么病，有个头痛脑热的对于一个二十六岁的年轻小伙子也算不了什么。到工人医院是需要请假的，请假就要误工。他到工厂快二年了，从来还没有误过一个工呢，况且现在正是迎接“五一”的生产竞赛期间。他有一个理想，他要争取当劳动模范。所以他没有去。
    他紧张地工作了一天。第二天，三月六日，又上班了。虽然觉得头有些痛，身上也发烧，可是他仍然相信自己的身体是能够抵抗一切病症的。
    七日早晨钟声敲了五下之后，郎大嫂又去敲严宗尧的门。他在里面答应了，声音很小，糊里糊涂的。郎大嫂还以为他起来了呢，也没有在意，就回到自己家里了。
    可是这一天严宗尧没有上班。晚上下班之后，他同班的工人唐少金说：“怎么今天严宗尧没有上班呢？他从来不旷工的，今天他也没有请假……”于是唐少金就和另一个工人到他家里来了。敲了半天门，没人答应。他们把门弄开一看，他已经死了！唐少金急忙把这个不幸的消息报告给厂里、医院和派出所，并且打电报给严宗尧的妻子富金华。
    电报是富金华的爸爸接到的。他并没有立时告诉女儿。他怕女儿一时太难过。他只催促女儿马上回沈阳。富金华惊慌了，他不知道发生了什么事情。她急忙携着小丽君上了火车，她爸爸也陪着她一起来了。
    他们在沈阳下了火车，急急忙忙地走向自己的家里。可是他家的门封上了，不能进去。郎大嫂把她们接到自己的家里。这时郎大嫂告诉了她：“你丈夫得急病死了！”
    富金华从头顶到脚跟立时全凉了。她一点力气也没有了。她站不稳了。她倒下来了。她张开嘴，半天才哭出声来。像是做梦一样，这二年，幸福的生活刚刚开头儿，可是，到底发生了什么事情呢？
    小丽君虽然五岁了，可是还是一个不十分懂事的孩子。她还没有听说过死，也不知道死亡是什么，她以为她爸爸上班还没有回来！
    她问：“爸爸死了还回不回来呢？”人们告诉她：
    “死了就永远不会回来了！”早先，每天晚上爸爸下班回来，妈妈把热气腾腾的饭菜端上来，三口人有说有笑地吃着。到星期日爸爸抱着她，和妈妈一起到商店里买玩具，买糖果。可是爸爸永远不会回来了，她也哭了！
    严宗尧被抬到中国医科大学之后，经过病理学系李佩琳教授的解剖检查，证明是因染急性传染性脑炎而死亡的。这种脑炎和日本乙型脑炎不同，在中国从来没有发生过。把李教授接连所解剖检查的其他的脑炎死者联系起来看，已经有充足的理由来说明这显然是美帝国主义进行细菌战的结果。
    严宗尧和全国人民一样，他的生活是幸福的。他充满了生产的热情，充满了建设新中国的远大理想和个人的美丽的希望。可是美帝国主义的细菌战破坏了他幸福的家庭，破坏了他的希望。当严宗尧被美帝国主义细菌战所害死的消息传到工厂以后，一个规模宏大的反细菌战运动和生产运动，同时展开了。
