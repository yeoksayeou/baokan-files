    Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council Holds Expanded Executive Committee Meeting
    Discussing the Launching of a Citywide Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign
    [From our newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council convened an expanded executive committee meeting on the 12th to discuss the launch of a citywide patriotic production increase and thrift campaign.

    Attendees at the meeting clearly recognized during discussions that to formulate an advanced production increase and thrift plan, the plan must be given to the workers for serious discussion based on clever ideas and clues. For example, after the Beijing Power Bureau distributed the plan, the staff and workers used their brains after mass discussion and found more than 600 clever ideas, and re-submitted an advanced plan to increase production and save 600 million yuan in wealth for the country in June. However, the leading cadres and technicians, as well as skilled workers, in many factories and mines still have conservative ideas when formulating plans. They underestimate the fact that the enthusiasm of the masses has greatly increased after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. They always want to make the plans lower, preparing to "aim wide and use narrowly," fearing that "the target will be too high to complete the task," holding the wrong idea that it is easier to "exceed" if the target is lower. Therefore, the masses feel that most of the plans made by the superiors in the factories are too low.

    Summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is the basic method of the production increase and thrift competition. When summarizing advanced experiences, the masses should be mobilized to participate, so that the promotion work is also done in the process of summarizing. When the No. 1 Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory summarized the experience of advanced producer Jin Zhaoying, it absorbed technicians and veteran technicians to participate in the summary work. In the process of summarizing, many conservative ideas of the masses were overcome, thus paving the way for promotion work. Attendees also proposed that the process of promoting advanced experience should also be the process of improving advanced experience. When the Beijing Garment Factory promoted the experience of advanced producer Xu Xun, it also integrated the experience of advanced producer Liu Kuizhen, making the experience promoted more abundant. However, some cadres still only talk about "cultivating this and that typical example," and do not seriously summarize and promote the existing creations of the masses. They believe that promoting experience "must be big, small is boring." Therefore, many good experiences among the masses have not been discovered. Some people still have serious conservative resistance to the promotion of advanced experience. For example, some people mistakenly believe that full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement violate operating regulations. These conservative ideas must be criticized.

    The discussion also found that improving the reward system and working conditions are urgent problems to be solved. The leadership of the production movement in private enterprises should be strengthened. On the basis of restoring and developing production, certain unresolved labor-capital relations should be resolved quickly; the production increase and thrift campaign should be carried out first in factories and stores where production is normal and has development prospects. At present, one of the important links in the production increase and thrift campaign in private enterprises is to improve and improve technology.

    Finally, Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, focused on the issue of mobilizing and organizing the masses of staff and workers to fully launch the patriotic production increase and thrift competition campaign. He said: In this great movement, not only must we increase production, but we must also save, and costs must be reduced. This is a necessary condition for large-scale economic construction. When launching this movement, we must grasp the main problems of the industry and avoid blindness. After pointing out the importance of improving technology and promoting advanced experience, he said: Trade unions must launch rationalization proposal movements and support every feasible rationalization proposal. As soon as clever ideas are discovered, the experience should be immediately summarized, promoted, and attention should be paid to examining the new problems and new experiences that have occurred in the practice of existing advanced experience, and further development should be made. He also pointed out that attention should be paid to solving the labor protection and welfare issues of employees, first of all the reward issue, so that the interests of the country and the interests of individuals can be specifically combined.

    At the meeting, Zhang Hongshun, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council, made a self-criticism of the mistakes of not really facing production and bureaucracy in the past work.

    北京市总工会召开扩大执行委员会议
    讨论开展全市性爱国增产节约运动问题
    【本报讯】北京市总工会在十二日召开了扩大执行委员会议，讨论开展全市性的爱国增产节约运动问题。
    到会人员在讨论中明确认识到要想订出一个先进的增产节约计划，必须把计划交给工人，根据窍门线索进行认真的讨论。如北京电业局把计划布置下去后，经过群众讨论，职工们开动脑筋，找出六百多件窍门，并重新提出一个六月份为国家增产节约六亿元财富的先进计划。但是许多厂矿的领导干部和技术人员以及技术工人，订计划时还存在着保守思想，对“三反”、“五反”后群众的积极性已大大提高了这一点估计不足，订计划总愿意订低些，准备“宽打窄用”，怕“高了完不成任务”，抱着低些容易“超额”的错误想法。因此，绝大部分工厂由上面订出来的计划，群众都嫌太低。
    总结和推广先进经验是增产节约竞赛的基本方法。总结先进经验时应当发动群众参加，这样，在总结的过程中也就作了推广的工作。华北农业机械厂第一分厂总结先进生产者金兆瑛的经验时，吸收技术人员和老技工参加总结工作。在总结当中，克服了不少群众的保守思想，因此也就给推广工作铺好了道路。到会者还提出了推广先进经验的过程同时也应该是提高先进经验的过程。北京被服厂推广先进生产者徐勋的经验时，同时也综合了先进生产者刘奎振的经验，使推广出去的经验越发丰富了。可是目前还有些干部只空谈“去培养这个那个典型”，不去认真总结推广群众已有的创造，他们认为推广经验“要就是大的，小的没劲”。所以群众中许多好的经验还没有被发现。有些人对推广先进经验还存在着严重的保守抵抗思想。例如，有的人错误地认为满载、超轴、五百公里运动是违反运转规程。对这些保守思想必须给以批判。
    讨论中也发现了改善奖励制度和劳动条件是急待解决的问题。私营企业中的生产运动的领导应该加强。在恢复与发展生产的基础上迅速解决某些尚未解决的劳资关系问题；在生产正常有发展前途的厂店中，首先进行增产节约运动。目前私营企业增产节约运动中重要环节之一是提高和改进技术。
    最后，中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚在会上着重地谈了发动与组织职工群众全力展开爱国增产节约竞赛运动的问题。他说：在这个伟大的运动中，不但要增产，还要节约，成本也必须降低。这是大规模经济建设的必要条件。在开展这个运动时，必须抓住本产业的主要问题，避免盲目性。在指出改进技术，推广先进经验的重要性以后，他说：工会必须展开合理化建议运动，支持每一个可行的合理化建议。发现窍门就应该马上总结经验，予以推广，并且应该注意考察已有的先进经验在实践中发生的新问题和新经验，进一步加以发展。他还指出：应该注意解决职工的劳保福利问题，首先是奖励问题，只有这样才能具体地把国家利益和个人利益结合起来。
    在会上，张鸿舜代表北京市总工会驻会常务委员会检讨了过去工作上没有真正面向生产和官僚主义的错误。
