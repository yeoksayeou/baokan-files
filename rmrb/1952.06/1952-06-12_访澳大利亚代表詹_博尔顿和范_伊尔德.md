Interview with Australian Representatives James Bolton and Reverend Van Eerde

On the morning of June 7th, the reporter interviewed Australian representatives Dr. James Bolton and Reverend Van Eerde, who were attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

Reverend Van Eerde, Secretary of the Australian "Committee for the Defense of Peace in the Pacific," first introduced the Australian people's struggle for peace. He said: "In April 1950, the Australian Peace Congress was held in Melbourne with the participation of more than 10,000 people; the next day, the Australian Peace Committee held its first meeting. There were 800 representatives from all walks of life attending this meeting, including representatives from trade unions, churches, and other areas. They represented the broad masses. The Australian Peace Committee advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and opposed the atrocities of the American army in Korea." Van Eerde pointed out: "Although the Australian peace movement is restricted by the government, the Australian Peace Committee has still launched a strong peace movement. For example, it launched two signature campaigns, one demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the other demanding the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, obtaining tens of thousands of signatures. In addition to the Peace Committee, the Australian people have other organizations working for peace. The 'Committee Against American Arming of Japan,' established in 1951, is one of them. When the government approved the American-made 'Japanese Peace Treaty,' this committee sent a delegation of more than 300 representatives elected from factories, rural areas, mines, families, churches, and other groups from all over the country to gather in Canberra to oppose the government's ratification of the 'Japanese Peace Treaty.' Because this delegation represented the will of the broad masses of the Australian people, Australian Prime Minister Menzies had no choice but to meet with them. In addition, in the past year, the Australian people have launched two major struggles directly related to defending peace. The first thing was that in the plebiscite on September 22 last year, the Australian people used the power of referendum to overturn the government's decision to outlaw the Communist Party. This struggle effectively resisted the government's war preparations plan and made a great contribution to the peace movement. The second thing was the Australian Youth Peace Festival held in Sydney in March this year, which included several thousand people. Although the Australian government prevented youth delegations from China, the Soviet Union, and other foreign countries from attending, and created difficulties in various ways, the festival still achieved great success. At present, the Australian people's struggle to defend peace is unfolding in various ways in various fields. For example, the Australian government recently passed a law restricting people from building houses, attempting to use construction workers and building materials to build barracks. This law was immediately opposed by the people. Because the people are experiencing a housing shortage, they need more housing, hospitals, and schools, but not more barracks. On March 18 this year, representatives of 300 construction workers, and representatives of hospitals, schools, and other groups, held a meeting to oppose the government's law and established a permanent special committee to urge the government to use the money for war preparations for the welfare of the people."

Speaking of how the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, especially the people of China and Australia, should strengthen their understanding and friendship, former Secretary-General of the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bolton said: "The understanding between the people of China and Australia is currently insufficient. Most of the news we hear in Australia is not very friendly to New China; we do not see in the newspapers the contributions of the people of New China to peace, and there is very little news about the construction of New China." However, Bolton pointed out: "It would be wrong to think that this means that the Australian people do not care about the situation of the people of New China. The news about germ warfare and the Korean armistice negotiations that the Australian representatives sent back from Beijing this time has received widespread attention in Australia, which is proof that the Australian people care about New China." Bolton believes that the way to increase understanding and friendship between the people of China and Australia is for the people of the two countries to visit each other more and introduce each other's living conditions more. Bolton pointed out that until now, the main efforts in this regard have been made on the Chinese side. The Australian representatives' invitation to come to China this time can enable the Australian people to better understand the situation in China.

Speaking of the role of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, Bolton said: "This meeting determined the nature of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and issued a declaration; the scope of future representatives participating in the conference should be wider, and some people have not yet participated in the peace movement, but they are opposed to war, and we need their help; perhaps their ideas may be different, but the goal of peace is the same. At this meeting, representatives of the people of many countries met directly, which made us personally feel the desire of the people of all countries for peace."

Finally, Bolton spoke about his impression of New China. He said that he had many feelings. What impressed him most was the enthusiasm of the Chinese people and their spirit of unity in their work. He said: "New China has completed many great tasks, and there are still many tasks to be done in the future. I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to complete them as well." He said that we thought these tasks would take ten times as long to complete, but the Chinese people have now completed them in one-tenth of the time. For example, the railway from Guangzhou to the Northeast was quickly restored to smooth traffic, which shows the spirit of unity of the Chinese people.

Finally, Bolton said: "I received news from Australia that the Australian people attach great importance to this preparatory meeting. If it were not for the fact that the number of delegates to the meeting was agreed not to exceed 500, I believe that there would have been many, many delegates who wanted to come to China at that time."

    访澳大利亚代表詹·博尔顿和范·伊尔德
    六月七日上午，记者访问了出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的澳大利亚代表詹·博尔顿博士和范·伊尔德牧师。
    澳大利亚“保卫太平洋和平委员会”秘书范·伊尔德牧师首先介绍澳大利亚人民为和平事业而斗争的情况。他说：一九五○年四月在墨尔本举行了有一万多人参加的澳大利亚和平大会；第二天，澳大利亚和平委员会召开第一次会议。参加这个会议的有各界代表八百人，包括工会、教会及其他方面的代表。他们代表着广大的群众。澳大利亚和平委员会主张和平解决朝鲜问题，反对美国军队在朝鲜的暴行。范·伊尔德指出：虽然澳大利亚的和平运动是受政府限制的，但澳大利亚和平委员会仍然展开了强有力的和平运动。例如，它曾发动了征集要求禁止原子武器与要求五大国缔结和平公约的两次宣言的签名运动，征得了成千成万的签名。除了和平委员会以外，澳大利亚人民还有其他为和平事业而努力的组织。一九五一年成立的“反对美国武装日本委员会”就是其中的一个。在政府批准美制“对日和约”的时候，这个委员会曾经推派了由各地工厂、农村、矿山、家庭、教堂以及其他团体选出的代表三百多人，组成代表团，在堪培拉集会，反对政府批准“对日和约”。由于这个代表团代表着澳大利亚广大人民的意志，澳大利亚总理孟席斯也不得不予以接见。此外，在过去一年中，澳大利亚人民还发动了两个直接与保卫和平有关的重大斗争。第一件事情是，澳大利亚人民在去年九月二十二日的公民投票中，运用复决权，推翻了政府宣布共产党非法的决定。这个斗争有力地抵制了政府的备战计划，对和平运动有很大的贡献。第二件事情，就是今年三月在悉尼举行的包括好几千人的澳大利亚青年和平联欢节。虽然澳大利亚政府阻止中国、苏联以及其他外国的青年代表团前往参加，并且在各方面给以刁难，但是联欢节还是取得了很大的成就。目前，澳大利亚人民保卫和平的斗争正在各个不同的方面以各种不同的方式展开。例如，最近澳大利亚政府通过了一项法令，限制人民建造房屋，企图把建筑工人和建筑材料都用来修造兵营。这项法令立刻遭到人民的反对。因为人民正闹房荒，他们需要更多的住宅、医院和学校，但不需要更多的兵营。今年三月十八日，三百个建筑工人的代表，和医院、学校以及其他团体的代表，开了一个会议，反对政府的法令，并且成立了一个常设的专门委员会，以便督促政府把备战的钱用于人民的福利。
    谈到亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民间，特别是中、澳两国人民间应该如何加强彼此间的了解和友谊的问题，前澳大利亚外交部秘书长博尔顿说：中澳两国人民目前彼此的了解是不够的。我们在澳大利亚所听到的大多数都是对新中国不大友好的消息；我们在报纸上看不见新中国人民对和平的贡献，报纸上也很少有新中国建设的消息。但是，博尔顿指出：如果有人认为这样便是澳大利亚人民不关心新中国人民的情况，那就是错误了。这次到中国来的澳大利亚代表从北京发回去的关于细菌战和朝鲜停战谈判的消息，在澳大利亚受到普遍的重视，这就是澳大利亚人民关心新中国的证明。博尔顿认为：增加中澳两国人民之间的了解和友谊的办法是两国人民多多互相访问，多多介绍彼此的生活情况。博尔顿指出：直到现在为止，在这方面进行了努力的主要是在中国方面。澳大利亚代表这次应邀到中国来，可以使澳大利亚人民更了解中国的情况。
    谈到亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的作用，博尔顿说：“这次会议确定了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的性质，并发出了宣言；将来参加会议的代表的范围更要广泛，有些人虽然还没有参加和平运动，但他们是反对战争的，我们需要他们的帮助；也许他们的想法可能不一样，但为和平的目标是一致的。在这次会议中，许多国家人民的代表直接见了面，这使我们亲自体会到各国人民对和平的愿望。”
    最后，博尔顿谈到他对新中国的印象。他说他的感想很多。而给他印象最深的是中国人民的热情，以及他们在工作中团结的精神。他说：新中国已经完成了许多伟大的工作，今后还要做许多工作，我深信中国人民也一定能够把它们完成。他说，这些工作我们认为要十倍的时间才能完成，而中国人民现在用十分之一的时间就完成了。例如，从广州到东北的铁路，很快就恢复畅通，这就表示出中国人民团结的精神。
    最后，博尔顿说：“我得到从澳大利亚来的消息，澳大利亚人民非常重视这次筹备会议，如果不是会议代表名额议定不得超过五百人的话，我相信那时候一定会有很多很多的代表想到中国来。”
