    In the great "Three-Anti" movement, on the one hand, the broad masses of the people exposed the seriousness of the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some cadres, demonstrating the necessity of people's supervision of government workers; on the other hand, the People's Government also demonstrated its impartiality to the broad masses, and severely dealt with any personnel who violated the interests of the masses, thereby further enhancing the initiative of the people. In order to consolidate and expand the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the broad masses to supervise the work of government personnel.

    An effective way to mobilize the broad masses to supervise government workers is to hold people's representative conferences at all levels effectively, fully promote democracy, seriously handle proposals, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. At present, the phenomenon of simply assigning tasks at the county-level people's representative conferences is serious. Originally, the "listening to the work report of the county people's government, conducting discussions, and putting forward criticisms and suggestions" at the county-level people's representative conference is stipulated in the organizational rules for county-level people's representative conferences, but it has been neglected. For example, before the seventh people's representative conference in Jixian County, Pingyuan Province, the standing committee of the people's representative conference specifically proposed to the county head:

    "The representatives requested the government to report on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous representative conference," but the county head refused to answer this legitimate request on the grounds that he was not prepared. This approach weakens the initiative of the people. If it is not thoroughly corrected, it will be impossible to mobilize the people to supervise government work.

    Secondly, the existence and number of proposals at the people's representative conferences are completely determined by the degree of promotion of democracy and whether proposals are handled seriously. The number of proposals, under current conditions, can generally illustrate the degree of concern of the people for government work. In places where democracy is fully promoted and proposals are handled seriously, the number of proposals generally increases from small to large; the representatives' enthusiasm for supervising the government is also getting higher and higher. For example, the proposals at the people's representative conference in Yangqu County, Shanxi Province, were 83 in the first session, and reached 345 in the fifth session, which is more than four times the first session. On the contrary, in places where the democratic rights of the representatives are not respected, democracy is not fully promoted, and proposals are not handled seriously, the number of proposals does not increase from small to large, but gradually decreases, even from having to none; the representatives' enthusiasm for supervising the government is also getting lower and lower. For example, the proposals at the people's representative conference in Pingtan County, Fujian Province, were 60 in the first session, reduced to more than 10 in the second session, and gradually disappeared after the third session.

    According to statistics from various places, in general areas, a portion of the proposals are criticisms of government work and cadre style. For example, in Xinzheng County, Henan Province, due to the full promotion of democracy, representatives put forward 33 criticisms of county-level directly affiliated units, 65 criticisms of district cadres, and more than 100 criticisms of township cadres at one representative conference. Facts show that the effect of mass criticism is far greater than the effect of higher-level criticism. For example, there were more than 1,000 proposals related to cadre style at the first district people's representative conference in Beijing, but only more than 100 at the second session, while commendatory proposals increased by 85. This shows that the cadre style has been greatly improved after the first round of criticism and education.

    Seriously handling people's letters is also an important method of mobilizing the people to supervise the government and cadres. The "Decision on Handling People's Letters and Receiving People," promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on June 7, 1951, stipulates: "All letters accusing agencies or staff members should be handled by the people's supervisory agencies. Accused agencies or personnel are strictly prohibited from taking retaliatory actions; those who retaliate should be punished, and those with serious circumstances should be handed over to judicial organs for punishment according to law." According to statistics from various places, a considerable portion of the people's letters are accusations or criticisms of cadres. For example, in Lishu County, Liaoxi Province, out of 137 people's letters in 1951, 107 were accusations of cadres, which is a much higher proportion than the proportion of criticism cases in the proposals of the people's representative conference. This shows that this regular, convenient, and direct method of criticism and reporting is very popular among the masses, and also proves the correctness of the State Council's decision of June 7, 1951.

    This work has been done better in areas such as Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, Northern Sichuan, and Northeast China; but some areas have not paid enough attention. For example, the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shaanxi Province received a total of 104 people's letters from June to October last year, but only 18 were processed; the office of the Tai'an Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province transferred 23 people's letters to various counties last year, but did not receive a report on the results of any of them. The reason why some places do not attach importance to the people's letters is that they regard the people's letters as personal trivial matters of a few people, and they put the handling of people's letters in opposition to other work tasks. When they see the masses criticizing or accusing cadres, they often try to excuse the cadres, saying that district and township cadres are too busy and overworked, and their working methods are simple, which easily provokes the masses' dissatisfaction, etc.; they adopt an attitude of disbelief towards the masses' criticisms, and even consider them to be "malicious accusations"; they are lenient and tolerant of certain cadres' mistakes, and often use investigation as an excuse to postpone things. Some district and township cadres even adopt an antagonistic attitude towards the criticisms of the people. For example, in the sixth district of Lishu County, the incident of tearing up people's letters even occurred.

    In October last year, the Northwest Military and Political Committee's office and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government's office, as well as other relevant departments, focused on inspecting the work of people's letters, which was a very good approach. If other provinces and regions could do the same, it would play a great role in implementing the State Council's decision of June 7, 1951.

    From the above situation, it is clear that the democratic style and democratic system of some of our county and district people's governments are still very inadequate and unsound. This is a great obstacle to mobilizing the broad masses to supervise government workers. In order to correct this shortcoming, it is necessary to conduct universal and in-depth democratic education among cadres and the masses. The county, city, district, and township people's governments must resolutely guarantee the democratic rights of the people. We should welcome the criticisms made by the people's representatives and the people, whether they are correct or not. We should accept the correct ones, and patiently explain the incorrect ones. All cadres should be educated that when they encounter criticism from the masses, they must not show any coldness to the critics, must not irritate the masses, and must not retaliate. Those who retaliate should be severely punished.

    In addition, the mass supervision from bottom to top must be combined with the supervision from top to bottom, so that the criticisms, reports, and accusations of the people can be dealt with in a timely manner. Therefore, it is also very important to improve the supervisory organs at all levels, develop supervisory correspondents, and set up suggestion boxes.

    Highly promoting democracy, effectively holding people's representative conferences at all levels, seriously handling people's letters, improving supervisory institutions at all levels, and mobilizing the broad masses to supervise government work and cadres are effective methods to eliminate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

### 发扬广大人民群众的积极性，巩固和扩大三反运动的胜利

    发扬广大人民群众的积极性，巩固和扩大三反运动的胜利
    中央人民政府内务部民政司秘书常乃光
    在伟大的“三反”运动中，一方面广大人民群众揭露了某些干部违法乱纪的严重性，说明了人民监督政府工作人员的必要；一方面人民政府也向广大人民群众表示了自己的大公无私，对任何违犯群众利益的人员均予以严肃处理，因而进一步提高了人民群众的积极性。为了巩固和扩大“三反”运动的胜利，必须继续发动广大人民群众监督政府的工作人员。
    发动广大人民群众监督政府工作人员的有效办法，是开好各界人民代表会议，充分发扬民主，严肃处理提案，开展批评和自我批评。目前，在县各界人民代表会议上单纯布置任务的现象是严重的。本来，县各界人民代表会议“听取县人民政府的工作报告，并进行讨论，提出批评和建议”，是县各界人民代表会议组织通则所规定了的，但被忽视了。如平原省汲县第七次各界人民代表会召开之前，各界人民代表会议常务委员会曾经特别向县长提出：
    “代表们要求政府报告对上届代表会议决议执行的情况”，而县长竟以没有准备为理由，没有答复这个合法要求。这种作法削弱了人民群众的积极性，如不加以彻底纠正，则发动人民群众监督政府工作是谈不到的。
    其次，各界人民代表会议提案的有无和多少也完全决定于发扬民主的程度和是否认真处理提案。提案数量的多少，在目前条件下，一般地可以说明人民群众对政府工作关心的程度。凡能充分发扬民主并认真处理提案的地方，提案一般是由少到多的；代表监督政府的积极性也愈来愈高。如山西省阳曲县各界人民代表会议的提案，第一次是八十三件，到第五次即达三百四十五件，相当于第一次的四倍多。反之，凡不尊重代表的民主权利，没有充分发扬民主，对提案没有认真处理的地方，提案的数量不是由少到多，而是逐渐减少，甚至由有到无；代表监督政府的积极性也愈来愈低。如福建平潭县各界人民代表会议的提案，第一次是六十件，第二次减低到十多件，第三次以后就逐渐没有了。
    根据各地的统计，一般的地区，提案中都有一部分是批评政府工作及干部作风的。如河南新郑县由于充分发扬了民主，在一次代表会议上代表们即提出对县直属单位的批评意见三十三条，对区干部的批评意见六十五条，对乡干部的批评意见一百多条。事实说明，群众性的批评的效果，远较上级批评的效果为大。如北京市第一次区人民代表会议有关干部作风的提案一千多件，到第二次就只有一百多件了，表扬性提案则增加了八十五件。这说明干部作风经过第一次的批评教育，已经有了很大改进。
    认真处理人民来信，也是发动人民群众监督政府和干部的重要方法之一。一九五一年六月七日中央人民政府政务院颁发的“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”中规定：“凡属控告机关或工作人员的信件，应交人民监察机关处理。严禁被控机关或人员采取报复行为；如有报复者，应予以处分，情节严重者并应送司法机关依法惩办。”根据各地统计，人民来信中相当多的一部分是控告或批评干部的。如辽西梨树县一九五一年一百三十七件人民来信中，即有一百零七件是控告干部的，其所占比例远较人民代表会议提案中批评案件的比例为多。这说明这种经常的、方便的、直接的批评检举方式很受群众欢迎，也证明了政务院一九五一年六月七日的决定的正确性。
    这一工作，苏北、河北、川北及东北等地区做得较好；但有些地区还不够注意。如陕西渭南专署去年六至十月共收到人民来信一百零四件，而处理的仅十八件；中共山东泰安地委办公室在去年一年中曾转交各县人民来信二十三件，但没有接到一件处理结果的报告。有些地方所以不重视人民群众的来信，是因为他们把人民来信当做少数人的个人小事，并且把处理群众来信和其他工作任务对立起来。一见群众批评或控告干部，常常为干部开脱，如说区乡干部太忙太苦，工作方式简单，易惹群众不满等等；对群众的批评则采取不相信的态度，甚至认为是“挟嫌诬告”；对某些干部的错误则姑息宽容，常借口调查，一推了事。某些区乡干部对于人民群众的批评甚至采取对立态度。如梨树县六区甚至曾发生扯毁群众来信的事情。
    去年十月间，西北军政委员会办公厅和陕西省人民政府办公厅以及其他有关部门，曾经有重点地检查了人民来信工作，这种办法很好。其他省区如能这样检查一下，对贯彻政务院一九五一年六月七日的决定将起很大作用。
    从以上情况显然可以看出，我们某些县、区人民政府的民主作风和民主制度还是非常不够和不健全的。这是发动广大人民群众监督政府工作人员的极大障碍。为了纠正这一缺点，必须在干部和群众中普遍深入地进行民主教育，县、市、区、乡人民政府均必须坚决保障人民群众的民主权利。人民代表及人民群众对我们提出的批评，不管正确与否，我们均应抱欢迎态度。正确的固然应当接受，不正确的也要耐心加以解释。要教育所有干部，遇到群众批评时，对批评者不能表示丝毫冷淡，不能刺激群众，更不准打击报复。如有打击报复的，要严厉处分。
    此外，自下而上的群众监督必须和自上而下的监察相结合，以使人民群众的批评、检举、控告能及时地得到处理。因此，健全各级监察机关，发展监察通讯员，广设意见箱，也是非常重要的。
    高度发扬民主，开好各界人民代表会议，认真处理人民来信，健全各级监察机构，发动广大人民群众起来监督政府工作和干部，这就是肃清贪污、浪费和官僚主义的有效方法。
