    Evidence of US Military Bombardment of Panmunjom Conference Area Killing and Wounding Korean Peaceful Residents
    Top right: From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM on June 5th, the US side used seventy air-burst bombs to bombard the Panmunjom conference area, killing three children. Including the outer edge of the conference area, a total of five peaceful residents were killed and nine were wounded. This is further evidence of the "humanitarian principles" that the American aggressors proclaim every day at Panmunjom. The picture shows three-year-old Min Bing-shun, a girl whose head was injured by a US bomb in the Panmunjom conference area, lying unconscious in her mother's arms.
    Top left: An older brother holds his remaining younger brother - an infant less than one year old who was wounded in the head and legs by a US bomb. His mother and another two-year-old brother have been killed by US bombs. Now only the two of them are left, standing alone and forlorn next to the boundary marker of the conference area.
    Bottom right: An old grandmother holds her grandson, who was wounded in the head by a US bomb, and tells the Chinese People's Volunteers workers who rushed to the scene to investigate the American atrocities, and thanks the Chinese People's Volunteers for their concern.

    美军炮轰板门店会场区杀伤朝鲜和平居民的罪证
    上右：六月五日上午八时至九时，美方用七十发空炸炮弹轰击板门店会场区，杀伤儿童三名，连同会场外边缘区，共炸死和平居民五人，伤九人。这就是美国侵略者天天在板门店叫嚣的“人道原则”的又一说明。图为在板门店会场区内被美国炮弹击伤头部的三岁女孩闵丙顺，昏迷地躺在她母亲的怀里。
    上左：一个年幼的哥哥抱着他剩下的一个弟弟——被美国炮弹炸伤了头部和腿部的未满周岁的乳儿。他的母亲和另一个两岁的弟弟已被美国炮弹炸死。现在只剩他们两人孤苦伶仃地站在会场区域的界牌旁边。
    下右：一个老祖母抱着被美国炮弹炸伤了头部的孙子，对赶赴现场进行调查的中国人民志愿军工作人员诉说美方暴行，并感谢中国人民志愿军对他们的关怀。
