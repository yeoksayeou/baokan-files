    The challenge of the Hao Jianxiu Group to the nation's textile workers was put forward on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the great improvement of the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the working masses. This challenge shows that the fighting enthusiasm of the textile workers has been timely and consciously shifted from the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to production. This not only has a great effect on consolidating the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements but also aroused the patriotic production increase and economy campaign among textile workers. Now, 33 fine yarn worker groups from Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, Chongqing, Shijiazhuang, and other places, as well as 97 groups and workshops from the front spinning, preparation, power, repair, and maintenance departments, have responded to the challenge of the Hao Jianxiu Group. The challenge of the Hao Jianxiu Group has received enthusiastic responses in various departments of the textile industry. Comprehensively and deeply carrying out the Hao Jianxiu Group competition will not only play a great role in further promoting advanced production experience but also have a significant effect on promoting the production increase and economy campaign, improving enterprise management, and reducing costs. This is an important guarantee for overfulfilling the state production plan and the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 37,844 billion yuan.

    Therefore, textile trade union organizations at all levels should organize and lead this competition in a planned way, taking this competition as a central link in the current patriotic production increase and economy campaign, and through this competition, shift the focus of all work to organizing the production increase and economy campaign. Textile trade union organizations at all levels should vigorously carry out propaganda, widely organize the worker masses in various departments of the textile industry, earnestly discuss the significance of the Hao Jianxiu Group competition and study the challenge letter of the Hao Jianxiu Group, formulate their own specific conditions for responding to the challenge based on the specific conditions of their own units, rise up to respond to the challenge, and challenge workers in the same department to comprehensively carry out the competition. The competition should focus on further promoting and consolidating the Hao Jianxiu work method, the 1951 weaving work method, and other advanced experiences, and pay attention to constantly overcoming various ideological and management system obstacles that hinder the promotion of advanced experiences. In the competition, experience should be summarized in a timely manner, and a regular inspection system should be established so that this movement can develop solidly and sustainably.

    Organizing the Hao Jianxiu Group competition is the key to textile trade union organizations' patriotic production increase and economy campaign. Textile trade union organizations at all levels should immediately, under the leadership of the Party and the local Federation of Trade Unions, seriously study this instruction, make overall plans based on local specific conditions, and step by step and under leadership, through the Hao Jianxiu Group competition, comprehensively carry out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, improve trade union work, assist the administration in improving enterprise management, and prepare for the country's large-scale economic construction.

    中国纺织工会全国委员会
    关于组织郝建秀小组竞赛的指示
    郝建秀小组向全国纺织工人的挑战，是在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，在工人群众的阶级觉悟和生产积极性大大提高的基础上提出来的。这一挑战，说明纺织工人的斗争热情已经及时地自觉地由“三反”“五反”转到生产上来。这不但对巩固“三反”“五反”运动的胜利有很大作用，而且引起了纺织工人的爱国增产节约竞赛。现在向郝建秀小组应战的，已经有青岛、上海、天津、无锡、重庆、石家庄等地三十三个细纱工人小组，和前纺、准备、原动、修机、保全等部门九十七个小组和车间。郝建秀小组的挑战，已经在纺织工业各个部门中，得到了热烈的响应。全面地深入地开展郝建秀小组竞赛，不但能对进一步推广先进生产经验起极大的作用，而且对推动增产节约运动，改进企业管理，降低成本有重大作用。这是超额完成国家生产计划和增产节约三万七千八百四十四亿元任务的重要保证。
    因此，纺织工会各级组织应该有组织有计划地领导这一竞赛，把这一竞赛作为目前开展爱国增产节约运动的中心一环，通过这一竞赛，把一切工作的重点转到组织增产节约运动上来。纺织工会各级组织应大力展开宣传，广泛组织纺织工业各个部门的工人群众，认真讨论郝建秀小组竞赛的意义和研究郝建秀小组的挑战书，根据自己单位的具体情况，拟定自己的具体的应战条件，奋起应战，并向同一部门工人挑战，把竞赛全面开展起来。竞赛应该以进一步推广和巩固郝建秀工作法、一九五一织布工作法和其他先进经验为主要内容，并注意不断克服阻碍先进经验推广的各种思想上和管理制度上的障碍。在竞赛中，应该及时总结经验，建立经常的检查制度，使这一运动能巩固地持久地发展下去。
    组织郝建秀小组的竞赛，是纺织工会组织爱国增产节约运动的关键。纺织工会各级组织，应立即在党与地方总工会的领导下，认真研究这一指示，根据当地具体情况，作出统盘计划，有步骤有领导地通过郝建秀小组的竞赛，全面开展爱国增产节约运动，改进工会工作，协助行政改进企业管理，为迎接国家大规模的经济建设做好准备工作。
                                    一九五二年五月三十一日
