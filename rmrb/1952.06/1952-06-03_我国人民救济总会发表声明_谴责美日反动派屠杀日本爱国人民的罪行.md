    Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd -- The China People's Relief Association issued a statement on the 1st, condemning the bloody crimes of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in slaughtering patriotic Japanese people. The statement is as follows:
    On May 1st of this year, the Japanese working people held nationwide, unprecedentedly enthusiastic gatherings to celebrate International Labor Day. At the meetings, they put forward patriotic slogans, which also fully conformed to the broad interests of world peace, expressing the unshakable determination of the Japanese people to defend peace, freedom, and independence, and to oppose aggression, oppose war, oppose separate peace treaties, oppose the rearmament of Japan, oppose the fascist traitorous rule, and oppose the reactionary bills that undermine human rights.
    Celebrating their own festival is the sacred and inviolable right of the Japanese working people. However, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries actually carried out a bloody massacre of patriotic Japanese people who were gathering, resulting in the death or injury of more than 400 patriotic people on the spot. Moreover, they continuously carried out large-scale arrests and persecutions, and even subjected those injured and hospitalized to abuse such as forced interrogation. As of May 26th, the number of people arrested had reached 955. Before the bloodstains of the "May 1st" tragedy were dry, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, on May 30th, while patriotic Japanese people were gathering to commemorate the "May 30th" incident and holding a funeral for the martyrs slaughtered in the May 1st tragedy, created a new bloody incident, once again slaughtering patriotic Japanese people.
    As the world knows, this kind of cruel crime, this kind of bloody suppression, thoroughly exposes the extreme fragility and desperation of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. We, the Chinese people, fully sympathize with the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace. We protest the barbaric atrocities of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. The people's blood will not be shed in vain. We firmly believe that the Japanese people, with the strong support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely achieve a comprehensive and thorough victory.

    我国人民救济总会发表声明
    谴责美日反动派屠杀日本爱国人民的罪行
    【新华社二日讯】中国人民救济总会在一日发表声明，谴责美、日反动派屠杀日本爱国人民的血腥罪行。声明如下：
    今年五月一日，日本劳动人民举行了全国规模的、空前热烈的集会，庆祝国际劳动节。他们在会上提出了爱国主义的、同时完全符合于世界和平之广大利益的口号，表示了日本人民保卫和平、自由与独立和反对侵略、反对战争、反对单独和约、反对重新武装日本、反对法西斯卖国统治、反对摧残人权的反动法案的不可动摇的决心。
    庆祝自己的节日是日本劳动人民神圣不可侵犯的权利。但是，美、日反动派竟向集会的日本爱国人民进行了血腥的屠杀，以致当场打死打伤爱国人民达四百名以上，而且连续进行了大批的逮捕和迫害，对于受伤入院医治的人，也进行了强迫审讯等虐待。截至五月二十六日为止，被逮捕的人已达九百五十五名。“五一”惨案血迹未干，而美、日反动派又于五月三十日，正当日本爱国人民集会纪念“五·三○”事件并为五一惨案中被屠杀的烈士举行葬仪的时候，制造新的血腥事件，再一次屠杀日本爱国人民。
    举世周知，这种残酷的罪行，这种血腥的镇压，正好彻底暴露出美、日反动派的极端脆弱，日暮穷途。我们中国人民充分同情日本人民为独立、民主、和平而进行的斗争。我们抗议美日反动派的野蛮暴行。人民的鲜血不会白流的。我们坚决相信日本人民在全世界爱好和平人民的强大支援下，一定能取得全面彻底的胜利。
