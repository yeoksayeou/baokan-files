Excellent Rural Female Teacher, Tian Guizhi
Chen Jin Yan (artist)

(Four) Tian Guizhi, who had just graduated from the county's complete primary school and returned home, was busy looking at the school building allocated to her by the village as soon as she got home. One side of the room was piled with desks and chairs, and the other side was inhabited by villagers. Several children were playing boisterously.

(Five) The next day, she finally cleaned up the school building, hung the door panel she brought from home that was brushed with soot black on the wall, and went door-to-door to find eighteen students. During class, there were more people outside the window than students. One person said: "She doesn't look like a teacher at all! She's not even as tall as the students!" Another said: "Such a small teacher can't control the situation!" Someone even pointed to the words on the blackboard and said: "What do these two strokes of writing look like?"

(Six) On the road, a loafer used strange characters used for "drawing talismans and chanting spells" to "test" her, and told everyone: "Teacher Tian was stumped by me." A private school teacher incited the students, saying: "What does a little girl who has only studied for a few years know? ... I'll teach you!" As a result, there were fewer and fewer students.

    优秀的乡村女教师田桂芝

    （四）刚从县里完全小学毕业回来的田桂芝，一到家就忙着去看屯里拨给她的校舍。房里一边堆着桌椅，另一边住着老乡。几个孩子顽皮地滚成一团。
    （五）第二天，她好容易把校舍整理好，又把从家里带来的刷上锅底黑灰的门板挂在墙上，再挨家逐户找来十八个学生。上课时，窗外的人比学生还多。这个说：“哪像个老师样？还没学生高呢！”那个说：“这么小的老师也压不住场啊！”一个人竟指着黑板上的字说：“这两笔字像个啥？”
    （六）在路上，一个二流子用“画符念咒”用的怪字来“考”她，并且到处说：“田老师被我考住了。”一个教私塾的煽动学生说：“才念几年书的小毛丫头会个啥？……我教你吧！”结果学生越来越少。
