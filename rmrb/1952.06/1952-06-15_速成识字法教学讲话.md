Teaching Speech on Quick Literacy Method
Sixth Lecture:开展阅读、写字、写话活动 (Carry out Reading, Writing, and Speaking Activities)

    After recognizing more than two thousand characters, a general review must follow. Because newly learned characters are easily forgotten if not promptly consolidated and improved. The main method of consolidating literacy is extensive reading (writing activities or after graduation should not be interrupted). At the same time, reading is one of our main purposes of literacy. In newspapers and books, each learned character appears repeatedly. When everyone sees them more often, they will remember the new characters. And doing so fully meets the requirements of the students. When they can read some news, stories, and other articles from books and newspapers, their pleasant psychology is indescribable. This will further enhance their reading mood.

    How to guide reading? First, the reading materials must be closely related to the newly learned characters. Our wordbooks are mostly selected from volumes one to four of the military's national language textbook, so we must organize students to read the above-mentioned textbooks according to their different levels. These four books have large fonts, which are clear to see and relatively easy to read. However, going from large characters to small characters, from regular script to lead type, is not a small difficulty for people who have just learned two thousand characters. Therefore, in the beginning, we cannot rush it. We can introduce them to some popular reading materials suitable for soldiers. Second, when starting to read, students generally like to read rhythmic stories and rhymes. One is because the text has rhyme, making it easy to read; the other is because the sentences are short, making it easier to distinguish the pauses. Overly long sentences are difficult to understand, which often affects their reading mood. Therefore, reading should not be too fast. First, require them to pronounce the words accurately, and then read them several times in succession. If the sentences are not very profound, the general meaning can be understood. For difficult texts, the teacher should provide demonstration explanations and specific guidance during reading. Third, reading should not only review new characters, but also further occupy the sound and meaning of the characters, and ponder the shape of the characters. Chinese characters do not only have one sound and one explanation per character; some characters can have several pronunciations and several interpretations. When quickly learning new characters, we cannot explain everything, but in reading, we need to further appropriately resolve it. For example, when learning new characters quickly, the character "长" (cháng, long/chief) only explains the "长" (zhǎng, chief) in "班长" (bānzhǎng, squad leader) and "连长" (liánzhǎng, company commander), but in reading, students encounter "长期奋斗" (chángqí fèndòu, long-term struggle) and "长江" (Chángjiāng, Yangtze River), they will realize that the "长" (zhǎng) in "班长" (bānzhǎng) is also the "长" (cháng) in "长期奋斗" (chángqí fèndòu) and "长江" (Chángjiāng). Because adults have strong comprehension ability, we can require students to use the spirit of blitz to further occupy the sound and meaning of characters in large quantities. Students with lower levels are most prone to the following problems in reading: First, misreading characters, such as reading "金" (jīn, gold) as "全" (quán, whole), reading "政" (zhèng, politics) as "治" (zhì, governance), and confusing "更" (gèng, more), "便" (biàn, convenient), and "使" (shǐ, use); Second, reading too fast, such as reading "保护我们的好生活" (bǎohù wǒmen de hǎo shēnghuó, protect our good life) as "保护我们的好生产" (bǎohù wǒmen de hǎo shēngchǎn, protect our good production), and sometimes adding or dropping words; Third, repetitive reading also occurs, such as when reading "一股劲往下流" (yī gǔjìn wǎng xià liú, flowing downwards with a rush), often reading it as "一股劲往下往下流" (yī gǔjìn wǎng xià wǎng xià liú, flowing downwards downwards with a rush), or adding "吗" (ma), "呀" (ya), "哪" (na) and other oral tones when reading. The main reason for these problems is that students cannot read in sentences. Therefore, in terms of guidance methods, the teacher can first perform a model reading and explain the reading method, or have a student who reads relatively fluently lead the reading once. At the beginning, it is necessary to emphasize "pointing at each word," that is, reading while pointing at each word. At the same time, appropriately teach several punctuation marks, such as "." (period), "," (comma), "?" (question mark), etc., which are of great help to reading. In such extensive reading, students can also grasp the appearance of the characters more accurately, which is of great help to writing.

    How to guide writing? After extensive reading, each character has been seen many times. Students can already write simple characters, and they can break down complex characters to write them. Except for particularly difficult characters, there is no need to teach them stroke by stroke. This means that writing can also take a rapid and intensive approach. Teaching writing, teaching stroke order, and teaching the writing of various strokes are generally carried out more systematically according to radicals and components. The soldiers call this step "grouping new characters." This teaching method also teaches students the preliminary method of looking up dictionaries. After "grouping new characters," the time for teaching how to look up dictionaries generally does not exceed one hour. Just talk about the points to be noted. When they can dictate about 500 characters, they can start teaching writing.

    How to guide "writing"? "Writing" teaching is a process for students to comprehensively review the sound, meaning, and shape of characters, and further improve. In the words of the soldiers, that is, "deploying troops and generals, they must listen to my command." When starting to "write," students generally feel that they have nothing to write, and their thinking cannot be opened up. The way to overcome this is to explain what "writing" is, and advocate writing whatever they say and charging forward. In specific guidance, you can also use: (1) Use the students' words to practice dictation; (2) You say, I write, everyone says, everyone writes. This can avoid the problem of "the words are thought of, but the characters are forgotten; the characters are remembered, but the words are forgotten"; (3) Speak and write for yourself, thinking and writing at the same time. In addition, "writing" can also be combined with reading, writing心得(xīndé, what you have learned), and writing outlines, which not only enriches the content of "writing," but also improves reading efficiency.

    When starting to "write," misspellings are inevitable, so correcting misspellings becomes an arduous and meticulous task. To achieve results in this work, it is necessary to rely on the strength of the masses and adopt the method of "mass discussion, teacher guidance," where the teacher circles the misspellings in the homework and submits them to the group for discussion; or prints the more common misspellings into correction assignments and submits them to the students for modification. After these steps, misspellings will slowly decrease.

    In short, guiding reading and "writing" is a relatively complicated task. It is an important key to consolidating the achievements of rapid literacy, and the time is also long. The above speech can only briefly mention this issue. In the future, we plan to introduce it to you in more detail in separate topics.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第六讲  开展阅读、写字、写话活动
    认会两千多个单字以后，必须接着来一个总复习。因为刚刚学会的生字，如不抓紧巩固、提高，很容易忘掉。巩固识字的主要方法是大量阅读（在写字、写话活动中，或结业之后，也不应中断）。同时，阅读也是我们识字的主要目的之一。在书报上，每个学过的字反复地出现，大家和它们见面的次数多了，生字就记牢了。并且这样做，也完全符合学员的要求，当他们能从书报上读一些新闻、故事和其他文章的时候，他们那种愉快的心理是无法形容的。这样也就会更加提高他们的阅读情绪。
    怎样指导阅读呢？第一，阅读的材料，必须紧紧地结合刚学过的生字。我们用的生字本，大部分是从部队国语课本一至四册中选出来的，所以要根据学员的不同程度组织他们阅读上述课本。这四本书的字体大，看得清，读起来也比较容易。但从大字到小字，从正体字到铅体字，对刚刚认识了两千字的人来说，都是不小的困难。所以在开始时不能求之过急，可向他们多介绍一些适合部队战士的通俗读物。第二，开始阅读时，学员一般都喜欢读快板、顺口溜，一来文字有韵，读起来顺口；二来句子短，读起来容易分清句读。过长的句子，意思不容易了解，往往会影响他们的阅读情绪。所以阅读不要过于求快，先要求把字读准，然后再连起来多读几遍。如果不是含意很深的句子，大体上是可以弄清大意的。对难讲的课文，教员要进行示范讲解，还要在阅读中进行具体指导。第三，阅读中，不仅要复习生字，同时也要进一步占有字音、字义，捉摸字形。汉字并不是每字只有一音，一字只有一个解释；有的字可以有几个读法、几个讲法。在突击生字时，我们不能什么都讲，但在阅读中就要进一步适当地加以解决。如突击生字时，“长”字只讲“班长”、“连长”的“长”，而在阅读中学员碰到“长期奋斗”“长江”，他们就会领会到“班长”的“长”，也是“长期奋斗”和“长江”的“长”。由于成年人的理解力强，我们可以要求学员用突击的精神，进一步大量地占有字音，占有字义。程度低一点的，在阅读中最易犯的毛病是：第一，把字读错，如把
    “金”读成“全”，把“政”读成“治”，并把“更”、
    “便”“使”混淆起来；第二，顺嘴溜，如把“保护我们的好生活”读成“保护我们的好生产”，有时并发生添字掉字的现象；第三，重复地读的现象也是有的，如读“一股劲往下流”时，往往读成“一股劲往下往下流”，或者在读时带上“吗”“呀”“哪”等口音。这些毛病发生的主要原因，是由于学员读不成句。因此，在指导方法上，可以先由教员进行范读，说明读法，或者由读得比较通顺的学员领读一遍。开始时，必须特别强调“逐行指字”，就是一个字一个字地指着读。同时适当地教几种标点符号，如“。”号“，”号“？”号等，它对阅读也有很大的帮助。在这样大量阅读中，也能使学员把字的模样捉摸得更准，对写字也有不少的帮助。
    怎样指导写字？在大量阅读以后，每个字差不多都看过许多遍数，简单的字学员已经会写，复杂的字也能拆开来写了；除了特别困难的字以外，已经不需要一笔一笔地教了。这就是说，写字也可以采取突击速成的方法。教写字，教笔顺，教各种笔道的写法，一般地都按照部首、偏旁，较有系统地进行。战士们把这步工作叫做“生字编班”。这种教法，还附带地教学员初步学习了查字典的方法。在“生字编班”以后，教查字典的时间一般都不超过一小时，只讲一讲应注意的事项就够了。等他们能够听写五百字左右，就可以开始教写话。
    怎样指导“写话”？“写话”教学，是学员对字音、字义、字形加以综合复习，并进一步提高的过程。用战士们的话来说，那就是“调兵遣将，要听我指挥”。开始“写话”时，一般学员往往感到没啥可写，思路打不开。克服的办法，除了说明什么是“写话”以外，提倡说啥写啥、猛打猛冲。在具体辅导上还可以采用：（一）利用学员的话练习听写；（二）你说我写，大家说大家写，这样可以避免“话想出来了，字忘了；字想起来了，话又忘了”的毛病；（三）自己说自己写，边想边写。另外，“写话”还可以和阅读结合起来，写心得，写大意，这样不但丰富了“写话”的内容，还提高了阅读效率。
    开始“写话”，错别字是难免的，因此纠正错别字就成为一个艰巨而细致的工作。这一工作，要取得效果，必须依靠群众的力量，采取“群众讨论，教员指导”的办法，由教员把作业中的错别字圈出来，交小组讨论；或把比较普遍发生的错别字，印成改错作业，交学员修改。经过这些步骤以后，错别字就会慢慢地减少。
    总之，指导阅读、“写话”是比较复杂的工作，它是巩固速成识字成绩的重要关键，时间也较长。上面的讲话只能简单地提到这一问题，今后我们打算分成专题向大家作较详细的介绍。
