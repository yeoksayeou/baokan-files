Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 15th: An observer here recently expressed the following views to our reporter regarding the British army's participation in the massacre of our captured personnel:

The British troops transferred to the Koje-do prisoner-of-war camp are no different from American murderers. Their crime of throwing tear gas bombs at our captured personnel on June 7th shows that the British army is an accomplice of the American authorities in their brutal persecution and murder of prisoners of war.

After the American authorities' plot to forcibly detain our captured personnel and their crimes of inhuman persecution and massacre of prisoners of war were completely exposed, arousing the anger and condemnation of people all over the world, they decided to gather the armies of their accomplice countries to Koje-do in order to drag them together into this abyss of bloody crimes. The British authorities, disregarding the opposition of their own people and the condemnation of world opinion, hastily followed American orders and transferred the Royal Shropshire Light Infantry and the Royal Canadian Regiment to Koje-do on May 24th, to share with the United States the grave responsibility of persecuting and massacring our captured personnel.

On May 29th, the sixth day after the British troops arrived at Koje-do, they, together with the American troops, threw tear gas bombs at the prisoners of war in Detachment Camp 66, and then, brandishing bayoneted rifles, rushed menacingly into the prisoner-of-war camp, destroying the prisoners' living quarters and firing shots to intimidate the prisoners who were singing collectively. After June 3rd, the British troops were solely responsible for guarding Detachment Camp 66. On June 7th, when our captured personnel were exposing to reporters near their camp the atrocities of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities in wantonly killing prisoners of war, the British troops, under the command of their company commander, Major Bancroft, again recklessly threw tear gas bombs at our captured personnel. On June 7th, a British soldier was burned on the hand by chemicals splashed from a gas bomb while throwing it at prisoners of war. In fact, it was not only these British troops sent to Koje-do who participated in the crimes of brutal persecution and murder of prisoners of war. Judging from the fact that Major General Cassels, commander of the British 1st Commonwealth Division, and Air Vice-Marshal Butcher successively came to Koje-do on May 30th and June 7th and held talks with Bonar, the executioner who personally massacred prisoners of war, the series of bloody incidents that have occurred on Koje-do recently are closely related to the British high authorities. Now the British Minister of Defense Alexander has come to Korea again. Alexander's trip will make the people of the world see more clearly what attitude the British authorities will take towards the prisoner-of-war issue that is currently attracting worldwide attention.

### 开城观察家谴责英军参与屠杀战俘的罪行

    开城观察家谴责英军参与屠杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城十五日电】此间观察家顷就英军参加屠杀我方被俘人员事向本社记者发表下列观感：
    调往巨济岛战俘营的英国军队，和美国杀人犯毫无二致，于六月七日向我方被俘人员投掷了催泪性毒气弹，这一罪行表明了英国军队是美国当局残害与谋杀战俘的帮凶。
    美国当局在它强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋和对战俘进行惨无人道的迫害与屠杀的罪行完全暴露，引起了全世界人民的愤怒和谴责之后，就决定调集其帮凶国家的军队到巨济岛去，以便把它们一起拖进这一血污的罪恶的深渊。英国当局，竟不顾其本国人民的反对和世界舆论的谴责，匆忙地按照美国的命令，将英国皇家舒洛伯郡轻装步兵团和皇家加拿大团的部队于五月二十四日调至巨济岛，与美国分担迫害与屠杀我方被俘人员的严重责任。
    五月二十九日，英国军队到达巨济岛的第六天，就和美国军队一起，向六十六号分营的战俘投过催泪毒气弹，然后又挥舞着上了刺刀的枪，杀气腾腾地冲入该战俘分营，捣毁战俘们的住室，并向集体唱歌的战俘鸣枪威吓。六月三日以后，英国军队单独负责六十六号分营的警戒任务。六月七日，当我被俘人员向围于其营地附近的记者们揭露战俘营当局恣意杀害战俘的事实时，英国军队在其连长班克罗夫特少校的命令下，又放肆地向我被俘人员投掷了催泪性毒气弹。六月七日英国一个士兵在向战俘投掷毒气弹时，曾被弹体中溅出的药水烧伤了手。其实参与残害和谋杀战俘罪行的并不只是这些开到巨济岛上的英国军队。从英国第一联邦师司令官卡塞尔少将、英国空军中将布彻于五月三十日和六月七日相继来到巨济岛，并与亲自屠杀战俘的刽子手波纳会谈的事实看来，最近这一时期巨济岛上所发生的一连串流血事件都是和英国的高级当局有密切关系的。现在英国的国防大臣亚历山大又到朝鲜来了，亚历山大此行更会使全世界人民看清英国当局对于目前天下瞩目的战俘问题究竟采取什么态度。
