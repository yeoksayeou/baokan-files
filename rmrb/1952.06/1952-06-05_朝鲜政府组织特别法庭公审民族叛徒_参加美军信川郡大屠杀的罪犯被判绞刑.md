Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 4th. The Special Tribunal of Pyongyang City, organized by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has been holding public trials since May 25th for Korean national traitors Heo Pil-soon, Choi Han-woo, Lee Doo-hyun, and Yoon Myung-won, who participated in the Sincheon Massacre in Hwanghae Province. Under the direct command of the invading US military, these four bandits participated in the world-shocking bloody atrocities of the US invading army in Hwanghae Province's Sincheon County from October 17th to December 7th, 1950, massacring more than 35,000 patriots and civilians. After five days of trial, the Special Tribunal sentenced the defendants Heo Pil-soon, Choi Han-woo, Lee Doo-hyun, and Yoon Myung-won to death by hanging on the 29th. The facts revealed during the trial not only proved the crimes of these four traitorous bandits but also clearly proved the crimes of the US aggressors in directing, organizing, and leading this extremely cruel and barbaric massacre. Therefore, this trial is not only a trial of the four defendants but also a public indictment of American murderers.

The Special Tribunal was headed by Park Kyung-ho, head of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court of Korea, with Lee Hong-ryeol, head of the Propaganda Department of the Korean Democratic Party, and Kim Moon-seok, head of the Engineering Bureau of the "New Korea" magazine, serving as assessors. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang, as well as representatives from government agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations, attended the trial. Foreign journalists stationed in Korea also attended. During the trial, every loudspeaker on the streets of Pyongyang was surrounded by people of Pyongyang who had deep-seated hatred for the US-Syngman Rhee gangs. With deep indignation, they listened to the live broadcast of this just trial.

After the Special Tribunal opened, the court clerk read the indictment filed by Prosecutor General Jang Hae-woo of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the four defendants. The indictment detailed the massacre by the US invading army in Sincheon County and the crimes of the defendants. At that time, Heo Pil-soon was the captain of the pseudo "Police Station Armed Student Corps," Choi Han-woo was the chief of the pseudo "Investigation Section," Yoon Myung-won was a member of the pseudo "Korean Youth Corps," and Lee Doo-hyun was a member of the pseudo "Police Direct Armed Team." Under the command of Harrison, an officer of the 2nd Battalion, 17th Regiment, 24th Division of the US military, they participated in the bloody atrocities of the US invading army in the large-scale arrest and massacre of civilians.

The indictment accused the atrocities of the US and Syngman Rhee gangs, stating: On October 17, 1950, the US invading army entered Sincheon City. On the second day of the US military's arrival, 900 people were arrested and shot. Two nights later, on Harrison's order, 350 people were shot in five batches under the light of car headlights. The next morning, 500 civilians were driven into the air-raid shelter of the Internal Affairs Bureau. The US military buried explosives in the cave, blocked the exit, and the defendant Heo Pil-soon lit the fuse. All 500 people, including 150 women and children, were killed in the explosion. Under Harrison's command, the US invading army and the Syngman Rhee bandits arrested and massacred patriots and civilians every day, and they also used torture on civilians. In Hyungdeok-ri, Sincheon Township, the defendant and American soldiers arrested Lee Ok-do, the chairman of the village people's committee, hammered nails into his head, and buried his seven children alive. In Youngdeung-ri, Sincheon Township, US soldiers attempted to rape Lee Ok-ah, and when she resisted, they were enraged, stripped her clothes, tied her to a tree, set her on fire, and then shot her infant.

The indictment pointed out that cases of US military and Syngman Rhee bandits raping and shooting women and girls occurred every day, and they also carried out large-scale looting of civilians. Investigations proved that they robbed more than 6,000 cattle, pigs, horses, and about 6,000 chickens from the county.

Before the US military fled the city, the defendants, under Harrison's command, arrested more than 900 women, children, and elderly people who refused to move south with the US military and drove them into the warehouse in Wonan-ri, where they were burned alive. Investigations proved that the US invading army and these traitorous bandits massacred more than 35,000 civilians, including more than 16,000 women. In addition, 10,000 civilians were abducted. The indictment pointed out that all these crimes were carried out under the orders of the US military headquarters.

After following the US invading army to flee south, the defendants were ordered to sneak into northern Korea to spy on the intelligence of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, and were finally captured by the Korean public security organs.

After the indictment was read, Heo Pil-soon, Choi Han-woo, Lee Doo-hyun, and Yoon Myung-won were interrogated in turn. During the trial, many victims who had personally suffered persecution by the US and Syngman Rhee bandits and escaped from the slaughterhouse testified. They sorrowfully and angrily accused the atrocities of the US and Syngman Rhee bandits.

Jang Ham-do, secretary of the Sincheon County Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, pointed out in his testimony that the US invading army killed more than 35,000 people in Sincheon County, accounting for one-fourth of the county's total population of 142,700. He also pointed out that the American executioners used the most cruel methods to kill civilians. For example, in one village, American soldiers caught a 13-year-old member of the Korean Children's Corps, gouged out his eyeballs with a bayonet, tortured him, and finally buried him alive.

Woo Mae-ze, a peasant woman from Bugeulsa-ri, Garyeon Township, accused the atrocities of the US invaders in her testimony, saying: My husband was an advanced farmer. The rice he planted had a high yield and he had won government prizes and certificates. On the first day the US invading army came to the village, twenty American soldiers arrested my husband and my daughter-in-law. They nailed the certificate to my husband's head with nails in the village square, then pierced him with iron wire, dragged him along the village, and beat him inhumanely. When the American soldiers wanted to rape my daughter-in-law, they tore off her clothes when she resisted, hung her naked on a tree with her hair, and then slashed her breasts with a bayonet, causing her multiple knife wounds. The American soldiers also cut my youngest son into pieces. Woo Mae-ze also said: The US invading army cruelly killed the principal of Garyeon Township Elementary School. US military officers and soldiers held him on the blackboard, nailed his hands and feet with nails, and then sawed off his head.

Witnesses in court angrily accused the atrocities of the defendants and the pseudo-police and secret service organizations, and pointed out that all the crimes of these traitors were committed under the command of the US invading army, and US military officers and soldiers directly participated in these crimes. On the 29th, after the interrogation of the witnesses was completed, representatives of the Sincheon County Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League and representatives of the Korean Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland successively made accusations. Then, An Byung-jin, prosecutor of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of Korea, spoke. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer and the defendant spoke. In the solemn people's court, in the face of conclusive evidence, the four defendants, Heo Pil-soon, and others, confessed without denial to their crimes of participating in the US invading army's massacre in Sincheon under the direct command of US Army Lieutenant Harrison.

Finally, the judge read out the verdict of the Special Tribunal in court, deciding to sentence the criminals Heo Pil-soon, Choi Han-woo, Lee Doo-hyun, and Yoon Myung-won to death by hanging. All the citizens of Pyongyang who attended the hearing and listened to the live broadcast expressed their warm support for the court's verdict.

    朝鲜政府组织特别法庭公审民族叛徒
    参加美军信川郡大屠杀的罪犯被判绞刑
    【新华社平壤四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高裁判所刑事部组织的平壤市特别法庭，从五月二十五日起开庭公审参与黄海道信川郡大屠杀的朝鲜民族叛徒许必淳、崔汉禹、李斗铉和尹明源。这四名匪徒在侵朝美军的直接指挥下，在一九五零年十月十七日到十二月七日的期间，参加美国侵略军屠杀黄海道信川郡爱国者与平民三万五千多人的震动世界的血腥暴行。经过五天的审判，特别法庭已于二十九日判决，对被告许必淳、崔汉禹、李斗铉和尹明源处以绞刑。审判中揭发出来的事实，不仅证明了这四名叛国匪徒的罪行，同时，也清清楚楚地证明了美国侵略者指挥、组织和领导这个极端残暴、野蛮的大屠杀的罪行。因此，这一审判不仅是对四名被告的审判，而且，也是对美国杀人犯的公开控诉。
    特别法庭由朝鲜最高裁判所刑事部部长朴京浩任审判长，由朝鲜民主党宣传部长李洪烈和“新朝鲜”杂志社工务局长金文锡任参审员。参加审判大会旁听的有平壤市各界人民代表以及政府机关、民主党派、人民团体的代表共一千多人。驻朝鲜的外国记者也都前往旁听。在审判进行时，平壤市街头的每一个扩音器前都站满了与美李匪帮有着血海深仇的平壤市人民。他们怀着深切的愤慨，聆听着这一正义审判的实况广播。
    特别法庭开庭后，法庭书记宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高检察所检事总长张海友对四名被告提起公诉的起诉书。起诉书详细地控诉了美国侵略军在信川郡的屠杀情形，以及被告的罪状。当时，许必淳任伪“警察署武装学生队”队长，崔汉禹任伪“搜查股”股长，尹明源为伪“大韩青年团”团员，李斗铉为伪“警察直属武装队”队员。他们在美军第二十四师十七团二营的军官哈里逊的指挥下，参与美国侵略军大规模逮捕与屠杀平民的血腥暴行。
    起诉书控诉美、李匪帮的暴行称：一九五零年十月十七日，美国侵略军进入信川城。在美军到达的第二天，即有九百人被捕并被枪杀。两天以后的晚上，根据哈里逊的命令，三百五十人在汽车灯光的照射下，被分成五批枪杀。次日晨，平民五百人被驱入内务署的防空洞中，美军在洞中埋好炸药，堵塞出口，被告许必淳随即点燃引信，这五百人其中包括一百五十个妇女和儿童全被炸死。在哈里逊的指挥下，美国侵略军和李承晚匪徒每天都对爱国者与平民进行逮捕和屠杀，他们并对平民施用酷刑。在信川面亨德里（译音），被告与美国兵逮捕了里人民委员会委员长李玉度（译音），把钉子敲进他的头，并活埋了他的七个孩子。在信川面英登里（译音），美军士兵企图强奸李屋娥（译音），因为受到她的抵抗而恼羞成怒，将她的衣服剥光，并把她绑在树上纵火焚烧，然后，又枪杀了她的婴孩。
    起诉书指出：美军和李承晚匪徒强奸与枪杀妇女和女孩的案件每天都有发生，他们并对平民进行大规模的掠夺。调查证明：他们自该郡抢走六千头以上的牛、猪、马以及约六千只鸡。
    在美军自该城逃跑以前，被告在哈里逊的指挥下，逮捕了九百名以上的拒绝随美军南移的妇孺老人，把他们驱入元安里的仓库活活烧死。调查证明：美国侵略军和这些叛国匪徒共屠杀了平民三万五千多人，其中包括妇女一万六千多人。此外，还掳走平民一万人。起诉书指出：所有这些罪行，都是在美军司令部的命令下进行的。
    被告等在跟随美国侵略军南逃后，又奉命潜入朝鲜北部刺探朝中人民军队的情报，终被朝鲜公安机关捕获归案。
    起诉书宣读毕，即依次审讯许必淳、崔汉禹、李斗铉、尹明源等四名被告。在审判中，许多亲身受到美李匪帮迫害、从屠场中九死一生逃出来的受害人和暴行的目睹者都出庭作证。他们悲愤地控诉了美、李匪帮的暴行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线信川郡委员会书记张咸道（译音）在作证时指出：美国侵略军在信川郡残杀了三万五千多人，占该郡居民总数十四万二千七百多人中的四分之一。他并指出：美国刽子手采用了最残酷的手段杀害平民。例如，在一个村子里美国兵捉住了一个十三岁的朝鲜少年团员，用刺刀把他的眼珠挑出来，并加以拷打，最后把他活埋了。
    加莲面伏尔沙里（译音）的农妇伍麦泽在作证时控诉美国侵略者的暴行说：我的丈夫是一个先进农民，他种的稻米产量很高，曾获得政府的奖品和奖状。美国侵略军来到村里的第一天，二十个美国兵就把我的丈夫和我的儿媳妇抓走了。他们在乡村广场上用钉子把奖状钉在我丈夫的头上，然后用铁丝穿着他，一面拖着他沿村子走，一面残无人性地毒打他。美国兵要想强奸我的儿媳妇，当她进行抗拒的时候，美国兵就把她的衣服撕掉，用她的头发把她赤裸裸地吊在树上，然后用刺刀划她的乳房，使她受刀伤数处。美国兵又把我的小儿子切得粉碎。伍麦泽并说：美国侵略军把加莲面小学的校长残酷地杀死了。美军官兵把他按在黑板上，用钉子把他的手脚钉住，然后将他的脑袋锯开。
    证人们在法庭上都愤怒地控诉了被告和伪警察、特务组织的暴行，并指出：这些叛徒的一切罪行都是在美国侵略军指挥下所犯的，这些罪行都有美国侵略军官兵直接参加。二十九日，在证人讯问完毕后，朝鲜民主妇女同盟信川郡委员会代表、朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线代表相继进行控诉。接着由朝鲜最高检察所检事安秉珍发言。最后是被告辩护人和被告发言。在庄严的人民法庭上，在确凿的证据面前，被告许必淳等四人无可抵赖供认了他们在美军中尉哈里逊的直接指挥下参加美国侵略军在信川的大屠杀的罪行。
    最后，审判员当庭宣读特别法庭的判决书，决定将罪犯许必淳、崔汉禹、李斗铉、尹明源判处绞刑。所有出席旁听的和聆听实况广播的平壤市民，对法庭的判决都表示热烈的拥护。
