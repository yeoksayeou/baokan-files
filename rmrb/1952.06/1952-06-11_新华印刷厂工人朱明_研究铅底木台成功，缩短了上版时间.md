    Xinhua Printing Factory Worker Zhu Ming
    Successfully Researches Lead-Base Wood Platform, Shortening Imposition Time

    Editor: Zhu Ming, a worker in the letterpress department of the Beijing No. 1 Factory of the Xinhua Printing Factory, successfully researched the "lead-base wood platform" used for imposition before the "May Day" holiday. Zhu Ming felt that the "wood platform" had many shortcomings as early as 1945. He had made three improvements, all of which failed. But he did not lose heart and continued to study, which is why he was able to succeed today. The "lead-base wood platform" is made by screwing a two-point thick lead plate onto a four-point thick wooden board with wood screws, and sawing three-point deep saw marks on the wooden board to prevent expansion and contraction. After the factory used it, it proved that the "lead-base wood platform" is much better than the "wood platform." The "lead-base wood platform" has greater resistance and a solid base plate, unlike the pure wood base platform which is prone to warping, so it can shorten imposition time by one-fifth and increase durability by one-quarter. Because the base is solid, the printed surface remains flat, so the printed matter can maintain uniformity and clear fonts, and it is no longer necessary to use stoppers and nail caps on the plate. The most important function is that apprentices can save the energy spent mastering the properties of wooden baseboards and quickly master imposition techniques. Now, all of the factory's Miller machines and flatbed machines use "lead-base wood platforms."

    新华印刷厂工人朱明
    研究铅底木台成功，缩短了上版时间
    编辑同志：新华印刷厂北京一厂铅印部工人朱明，在“五一”节前夕研究上版用的“铅底木台”，现已成功。朱明在一九四五年就感到“木台”的缺点很多，他曾经改进三次，都失败了。但他并没有灰心，仍继续钻研，这就是他今天能够成功的原因。“铅底木台”是把二分厚的铅板用木螺丝钉到四分厚的木板上，在木板上锯三分深的锯口，以防止伸缩。经这个厂使用结果，证明“铅底木台”比“木台”好得多。“铅底木台”抗力大，底板实，不像纯木底台容易跷拐，所以能缩短上版时间五分之一，提高耐久率四分之一。因为底实，版面始终平整，印出的东西就能保持均匀、字体清晰，还可以不在版上卡档板和上钉帽。最重要的作用是，学徒可以节省掌握木底板性质所花费的精力，很快地掌握上版技术，现在，这个厂的米力机、平台机已全部使用“铅底木台”了。    刘兆兰
