Responses to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions Regarding the People's Daily

    Reply from the Production and Drought Prevention Office of Wuyang County, Henan Province, Regarding Deviations in the Well-Digging Drought Prevention Campaign

    To the Editors: The "Letters from Readers" column in the May 13th People's Daily published letters from Comrades Wu Kegang and Zhao Peifu, criticizing the deviation in our county's well-digging drought prevention campaign towards simply pursuing quantity. This criticism is correct. When we deployed production tasks in mid-March, we lacked specific leadership and arrangements for well-digging drought prevention work, and we did not ideologically mobilize the masses, failing to make them truly realize the importance of well-digging drought prevention. This resulted in these deviations in some areas, wasting manpower and materials. After discovering this situation on April 3rd, we immediately notified all districts to correct it, filling in wells dug along both sides of the roads, and appropriately repairing substandard wells to make up for the losses, so that each well dug could truly play a role in drought prevention and resistance.

    Reply from the People's Government of Huaiyang County, Henan Province, Regarding Deviations in the Well-Digging Drought Prevention Campaign

    To the Editors: The "Letters from Readers" column in the May 13th People's Daily published a letter from Comrades Song Guoyu and Zhang Zhenhua, criticizing the formalism deviations that occurred in our county's well-digging drought prevention campaign. We sincerely accept this criticism.

    In carrying out the well-digging drought prevention campaign in our county, some cadres did indeed develop deviations in pursuing numbers and rushing tasks. After the county leadership discovered this deviation, they immediately corrected it. We have already made a public self-criticism in the Xin Huaiyang Bao and Henan Daily.

    Some of the criticisms from Comrades Song Guoyu and Zhang Zhenhua deviate from the facts. A specific explanation is as follows: 1. The criticism states: "Chenlou Township in the Second District dug twenty or thirty wells, but only two or three are useful." In fact, Chenlou Township is in the Eighth District, and it did not only dig twenty or thirty wells, nor were only two or three wells useful, but one hundred and fifty-two wells were dug, and more than ten wells were dug in pits. 2. The criticism mentions: "Zhang Jimin, director of the County Production Office, detained the masses because of disputes caused by the masses digging wells." In fact, the director of our County Production Office is Wang Jianmin. Since the launch of the well-digging drought prevention campaign, no incidents have occurred in our county of detaining the masses due to disputes caused by the masses digging wells.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    河南舞阳县生产防旱办公室对打井防旱运动发生偏向的答复
    编辑同志：五月十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了吴克刚、赵培福两同志的来信，对我县打井防旱运动中发生的单纯追求数量的偏向提出批评。这一批评是正确的。我县在三月中旬布置生产任务时，对防旱打井工作，缺乏具体领导和布置，也没有从思想上发动群众，没使群众真正认识到打井防旱的重要性，致使部分地区发生这些偏向，浪费了人力物力。我们在四月三日发现这一情况后，立即通报各区，加以纠正。把挖在公路两旁的井填平，把不合规格的水井，进行适当的修理，努力弥补损失，使所挖的每一个井确实能起到防旱抗旱的作用。  河南省舞阳县生产防旱办公室
    河南淮阳县人民政府对打井防旱运动发生偏向的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十三日“读者来信”栏内登载读者宋国玉、张振华二同志的来信，对我县在打井防旱运动中发生的形式主义偏向，提出批评。我们诚恳接受这一批评。
    我县在开展打井防旱运动中，有些干部确实发生过追求数字和赶任务的偏向。县领导方面发现这种偏向后，立即进行纠正。我们已主动地在新淮阳报和河南日报上作了公开的检讨。
    宋国玉、张振华二同志的批评中，某些地方与事实有出入，特作如下说明：一、批评中说：“二区陈楼乡打井二三十眼，只有两三眼顶用”。实际上，陈楼乡在八区，而且不是只打二三十眼井，也不是只有两三眼井能用，而是打了一百五十二眼井，有十余眼井打在坑里。二、批评中提到：“县生产办公室主任张继民曾因群众挖井闹纠纷而扣押群众”。实际上，我县生产办公室主任是王坚民，我县从开展打井防旱运动以来，还没有发生过因群众挖井闹纠纷，而把群众押起来的事情。
