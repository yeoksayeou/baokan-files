Xinhua News Agency Report: Paris - Under the slogans of "Striving for Peace," "Striving for Freedom and National Independence," and "Striving for the Immediate Release of Duclos, Stil, and Other Patriots," the French working people responded to the call of the Paris Regional Trade Union Federation, the National Railway Workers' Union, and many other trade union organizations by launching a strike on the 4th.

In order to suppress the strike struggle of French workers, French Interior Minister Brune hurried back to Paris, cutting short his holiday trip. On the 2nd, he held an emergency meeting with Bello, the head of the Paris Police Department, and Gaillot, the commander of the Paris Garrison. After the meeting, the Pinay government mobilized 20,000 police officers, 10,000 mobile police officers, 10,000 soldiers, as well as tank and armored vehicle units, ordering them to prepare for "mercilessly striking" the working people who were striking and demonstrating in Paris and other major cities across the country. All police officers and gendarmes in Paris had their vacations canceled. The Pinay government also threatened to suspend and discipline civil servants and public utility workers who participated in the strike. At the same time, the heads of the right-wing Socialist Party and the Catholic trade unions also issued orders to sabotage the strike. On the 4th, gendarmes with bayonets fixed stood guard at the terminals of various bus lines in Paris, at various train stations, around public buildings and factories. The American Embassy and all Americans' residences were also heavily guarded, as if facing a formidable enemy.

However, despite all of this, the working people of Paris still held the strike as planned. According to "l'Humanité" and "Ce Soir," hundreds of factories in Paris and its suburbs participated in the strike, including 100,000 metalworkers and 100,000 construction workers. The Renault automobile factory, the largest factory in the Paris region with 42,000 workers and staff, completely shut down. Slogans were posted on the factory walls: "Release Duclos!" "Drive out Ridgway!" "No to Fascism!" Large-scale strikes were held in Saint-Denis, Gennevilliers, Arcueil, Ivry, and other places near Paris.

The working people in other French cities warmly supported the patriotic strike of the Paris workers. In Marseille, railway workers, dockworkers, sailors, construction workers, tram workers, chemical workers, and metalworkers went on strike.

In the Rhône department, more than 50,000 metalworkers participated in the strike. Railway workers in Sète and the Lyon region, all dockworkers and many construction workers in Rouen, metalworkers in the Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle departments, workers in the Seine-Maritime department, and workers in Le Havre and many other cities went on strike. More than 12,000 working people in Toulouse held a demonstration, shouting fighting slogans: "Release Duclos! Ridgway get out!" and repelling the police's attack.

During the strike on the 4th, police arrested 150 trade union activists. However, the next day, the strike movement expanded even further. The National Railway Workers' Union, the National Miners' Union, the Construction Workers' Union, the metalworkers' unions of Meurthe-et-Moselle, Seine, and Gironde departments, and other trade union organizations called on workers to continue the strike. Workers at the Chausson automobile factory in Paris, who had gone on strike on the 4th, held an even larger strike on the 5th. The workers occupied the factory and decided to "continue the struggle until victory." Not a single worker reported for work at the Farman aircraft factory in Paris. In the Arcueil area, 85% to 100% of the workers in various factories participated in the strike. Twenty-five thousand metalworkers in the Nord department responded to their union's call and went on strike. All dockworkers, miners, sailors, ferry workers, and workers from 30 construction companies in Rouen went on strike. The strike in Charleville had spread to numerous factories, including the Auvert metallurgical factory. Factories in Nice also held strikes. The strike wave had even spread to Corsica. Dockworkers and construction workers in Bastia and construction workers in Ajaccio on the island went on strike.

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: "Pravda" correspondent in Paris, Zhukov, reported on the 6th: The French people are waging a tenacious struggle against the Pinay government's plot to fascistize France.

Zhukov said: During the large-scale strike in France on June 4th, hundreds of thousands of workers in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Béziers, Sète, Rouen, Le Havre, Toulouse, Drôme, Montpellier, Montreuil, and many other cities participated in the struggle. Despite police persecution and brutal repression, the French working people are increasingly resolutely shouting: "No to Fascism!"

Zhukov pointed out: The French government, like other governments controlled by the United States, is rapidly fascistizing France. "The Observer," which has always been openly hostile to communism, admitted on June 5th that Pinay's arrest of Duclos was clearly an act of "retaliation" and that there would be other "retaliatory" actions in the future. Now, the police are playing an increasingly important role in French life. The French police have always been domineering: as early as the 1930s, the head of the Paris police authorities, Chiappe, tried his best to pave the way for fascism; since then, the French police have gradually accumulated "experience" in colluding with the German secret police and the American secret police. For this reason, the facts that happen every day remind French men and women of the dark days of the Hitler gang's occupation.

On the day after the unforgettable "May 28th" demonstration protesting Ridgway's arrival in Paris, a veritable concentration camp was set up in the center of Paris, where hundreds of people, including the elderly, women, and even children, who had been arrested by the police on the streets of Paris, were detained.

In many places, police opened fire on unarmed peaceful residents. The police also hunted down a large number of trade union leaders. Not only Communists were searched, but also Catholics, Socialists, and non-partisans. "Le Monde" also said: The police will arrest anyone whose actions "may be dangerous." During the arrests, the police did not even think it necessary to produce an arrest warrant. This is the first time since France was liberated from Hitler's oppression that such downright fascist searches have taken place.

At the same time, the French reactionaries are making futile attempts to find a basis for the ridiculous "conspiracy" charge they have brought against Duclos. They do not hesitate to use the most despicable means learned from the Hitler bandits. For example, reactionary newspapers announced that they had arrested a certain Mentet, who was allegedly involved in Duclos' "conspiracy," and that an automatic rifle, a revolver, and even official documents from the Ministry of Defense had been found in his home. However, this dirty trick was immediately exposed by "Ce Soir": Mentet turned out to be a rampant Gaullist!

Zhukov finally pointed out that the French working class is bravely resisting this fascist conspiracy under the leadership of the French General Confederation of Labor. He said: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement on June 5th, summarizing the results of the first mass strike on the 4th, paying tribute to the tens of thousands of workers who rose up against fascist oppression, and calling on the working class to strengthen unity and continue the struggle for peace, freedom, and bread.

Xinhua News Agency: The World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Democratic Women's Federation, the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism, and other international democratic organizations have sent telegrams to support the French people who are heroically resisting the fascist conspiracy of the French government.

The World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the French General Confederation of Labor, protesting the French authorities' arrest of French Communist Party Secretary Duclos and "l'Humanité" editor Stil, and calling on the French working class to strengthen unity and fight against the danger of war and fascism.

Mrs. Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, protested to French Prime Minister Pinay, saying: On behalf of 135 million women in 62 countries, we strongly protest the bloody terror tactics adopted in Paris, the arrest of Member of Parliament Duclos, writer Stil, and other peace fighters. General Ridgway's arrival in France threatens the people of Europe with the destruction of war and the evils of bacteriological warfare. Mothers and women around the world believe that the actions of French patriots are a great contribution to the cause of peace and the defense of children. We would like to express our respect to them and fight to protect them.

The Secretariat of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism sent a telegram to comrades in France, saying: The International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism firmly protests the arrest of outstanding resistance fighter Duclos, protests the fascist repression of French patriots who are fighting heroically for peace and the independence of their country, and protests the construction of military bases and military headquarters in France. Resistance fighters from all over the world express their warm support for French patriots.

    争取释放杜克洛、反对法国的法西斯化

    【新华社讯】巴黎消息：在“争取和平”、“争取自由和民族独立”、“争取立即释放杜克洛、斯梯及其他爱国者”的口号下，法国劳动人民响应巴黎区工会联合会、全国铁路员工联合会及其他许多工会组织的号召，在四日开始举行罢工。
    为了要镇压法国工人的罢工斗争，法国内政部长布吕纳中止了假期旅行，慌忙赶回巴黎，在二日和巴黎警察厅长贝娄、巴黎警备司令高尤等举行紧急会议。会后，比内政府就动员了二万警察、一万机动警察、一万军队以及坦克和装甲车部队，要他们准备在巴黎和全国各主要城市对举行罢工和示威的劳动人民“进行无情的打击”。巴黎的警察和宪兵全部取消休假。比内政府还威吓着要给参加罢工的公务人员和公用事业工人以停职和纪律处分。同时，右翼社会党和天主教工会的头子也下令破坏罢工。四日当天，巴黎各公共汽车线路终点站、各火车站、公共建筑和工厂周围都有宪警手执上了刺刀的步枪在站岗，美国大使馆和一切美国人的房屋周围也都戒备森严，如临大敌。
    但是，尽管有这一切，巴黎劳动人民仍然按照原定计划举行了罢工。据“人道报”和“今晚报”报道，仅在巴黎市内和郊区，就有好几百个工厂的工人参加了罢工，其中有五金工人十万人、建筑工人十万人。拥有四万二千工人和职员的巴黎区最大工厂雷诺汽车工厂，工作完全停顿，厂房墙壁上都贴着标语：“释放杜克洛！”“赶走李奇微！”“不许实行法西斯主义！”巴黎附近圣但尼、日尼维埃、阿戎?伊及其他地方，都举行了规模宏大的罢工。
    法国其他各城市的劳动人民都热烈支持巴黎工人的爱国罢工。在马赛，铁路工人、码头工人、海员、建筑工人、电车工人、化学工人和五金工人都举行了罢工。
    在罗尼省，五万多个五金工人参加了罢工。塞特和里昂区的铁路工人，卢昂的全体码头工人和许多建筑工人，摩塞尔和穆尔特—摩塞尔两省的五金工人、下塞纳省的工人以及哈佛尔和其他许多城市的工人，都罢了工。吐鲁斯一万二千多个劳动人民还举行示威游行。他们高呼战斗口号：“释放杜克洛！李奇微滚出去！”打退了警察的进攻。
    在四日的罢工运动中，警察逮捕了工会活动分子一百五十人。可是，到第二天，罢工运动却更加扩大了。全国铁路员工联合会，全国矿工联合会，建筑工人工会，穆尔特—摩塞尔省、塞纳省、吉伦特省的冶金工人工会等等工会组织，都号召工人继续举行罢工。在四日曾举行了罢工的巴黎希奥普汽车工厂工人，在五日又举行了规模更大的罢工，工人们占领了工厂，决定“继续斗争，不到胜利不罢休”。巴黎法尔曼飞机工厂全厂没有一个人上工。阿戎?伊地区的各工厂有百分之八十五到百分之一百的工人参加了罢工。诺尔省两万五千冶金工人响应他们工会的号召，举行了罢工。卢昂所有的码头工人、矿工、海员、摆渡工人和三十家营造公司的工人，都罢了工。沙列维尔的罢工已经扩展到奥维尔冶金工厂等许许多多工厂。尼斯的工厂也举行了罢工。罢工浪潮甚至已经扩展到科西嘉岛上。这个岛的巴斯的亚地方的码头工人和建筑工人，以及阿雅绰地方的建筑工人，都举行了罢工。
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻巴黎记者朱可夫六日报道：法国人民正在对比内政府使法国法西斯化的阴谋展开顽强斗争。
    朱可夫说：六月四日法国举行大规模罢工时，巴黎、里昂、马赛、贝稷亚、塞特、卢昂、哈佛尔、吐鲁斯、达尔卑、蒙彼利埃、蒙塔尔伊及其他许多城市的好几十万工人，都参加了斗争。法国劳动人民不顾警察的迫害，不顾野蛮的镇压，正在愈来愈坚决地高呼：“不准实行法西斯主义！”
    朱可夫指出：法国政府，和受美国控制的其他各国政权一样，正在迅速使法国法西斯化。一向不讳言敌视共产主义的“观察家周报”在六月五日曾经承认：比内逮捕杜克洛的措施显然是一种“报复”行为，以后还会有其他“报复”行为发生。现在，警察正在法国生活中起着愈来愈大的作用。法国警察一贯是横行霸道的：远在三十年代，巴黎警察当局的头子夏比就曾竭力为法西斯主义铺平道路；此后法国警察又逐渐积累了和德国秘密警察以及和美国秘密警察狼狈为奸的“经验”。正因为这种缘故，现在每天发生的事实都使法国男女们回想起希特勒匪帮占领的黑暗时代。
    在难忘的“五·二八”抗议李奇微抵达巴黎大示威后的第二天，巴黎市中心竟然设立了一座名副其实的集中营，里面关着在巴黎街道上被警察抓去的好几百个人，其中有老人、妇女，甚至还有儿童。
    在许多地方，警察开枪射击手无寸铁的和平居民。警察又搜捕大批工会领袖。受到搜查的不单是共产党人，而且还有天主教徒、社会党人，以及无党派人士。“世界报”还说：凡是其行动“可能有危险性”的人，警察都要加以逮捕。在逮捕时，警察甚至认为无需出示拘票。自从法国从希特勒的压迫下获得解放以来，这种道地法西斯式的搜捕还是第一次。
    同时，法国反动派还徒劳无功地企图替他们加在杜克洛身上的可笑的“阴谋”罪名寻找根据。他们竟然不惜采用从希特勒匪徒那里学来的最卑鄙的手段。例如反动报纸宣布已经逮捕了据说是和杜克洛的“阴谋”有关的某一孟特，还说什么在他的家里已经搜出了一支自动步枪、一支左轮，甚至还有国防部的官方文件。可是，这种卑污的手段马上就被“今晚报”揭穿：孟特原来是一个猖狂的戴高乐分子！
    朱可夫最后指出法国工人阶级正在法国总工会领导下奋勇抗击这种法西斯阴谋。他说：法国总工会执行局在六月五日发表文告，总结了四日第一次群众罢工的结果，向成千成万奋起反对法西斯压迫的工人致敬，并且号召工人阶级坚强团结，为和平、自由与面包而继续斗争。
    【新华社讯】世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会等国际民主组织，先后打电报声援英勇抗击法国政府法西斯阴谋的法国人民。
    世界工会联合会打电报给法国总工会，抗议法国当局逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛和“人道报”总编辑斯梯，并且号召法国工人阶级加强团结，为反对战争危险和法西斯主义而斗争。
    国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人向法国总理比内提出抗议说：我们代表六十二个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女，坚决抗议在巴黎采取血腥恐怖手段，抗议逮捕议员杜克洛、作家斯梯以及其他和平战士。李奇微将军抵达法国，就使欧洲人民受到战争毁灭和罪恶的细菌战的威胁。全世界的母亲和妇女们认为法国爱国者的行动是对和平与保卫儿童事业的巨大贡献。我们谨向他们表示敬意，并且要为保卫他们而奋斗。
    抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会秘书处向法国的同志发出电报说：抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会坚决抗议逮捕杰出的抵抗运动战士杜克洛，抗议对为和平及祖国的独立而英勇斗争的法国爱国者进行法西斯镇压，抗议在法国建筑军事基地和军事总部。世界各国抵抗运动战士对法国爱国者表示热情的声援。
