Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. US Chief Representative Harrison submitted a so-called "protest" letter to our side on the 15th through his liaison officer, falsely accusing our prisoner-of-war camps of not having signs. This is yet another performance of the US side's usual trick of sophistry. Our Chief Representative General Nan Ri has already replied to the US side on June 17th, sternly rejecting this "protest."

Observers here believe that in the negotiation meetings, the US side's representatives have consistently failed to account for their bloody crimes of repeatedly massacring our captured personnel, and have also consistently failed to account for their repeated bombings and strafings of our prisoner-of-war camps, killing and wounding their own captured personnel. In order to divert public attention and cover up their crimes, the US side fabricated the lie that our prisoner-of-war camps did not have signs. However, all the conspiracies and tricks painstakingly devised by the US representatives have been repeatedly shattered by ironclad facts. The other side attempts to use this "protest" to accuse our side of not complying with the agreement, in order to cover up their own repeated acts of violating the agreement. However, since the two sides agreed on January 23 this year to establish signs in their respective prisoner-of-war camps, all our prisoner-of-war camps have immediately established signs in strict accordance with the length, width, style, color, and text specified in the agreement, without any deviation. At the meeting of the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item on March 1st, our representative General Li Xiangchao already informed the US side of this fact; on March 29th, during the meeting between the staff officers of both sides regarding the location and signs of the prisoner-of-war camps, our staff officers once again clearly informed the US side that our prisoner-of-war camps had already set up signs in accordance with the agreement. This time, the US side, with its chief representative coming forward, pretentiously raised a so-called "serious and strong protest" to our side on this issue. However, this unfounded lie, in addition to being rejected by our side and ridiculed by the world, will never play any role.

Observers here point out that another attempt by the US side in raising this "protest" is to dilute their towering crimes of wantonly massacring our captured personnel by accusing our side of not caring about the safety of prisoners of war. However, the stone that the other side lifted has hit their own feet. Because the facts prove that it is not our side but the US side that puts the "peace and security in danger" of the US captured personnel. Although the exact locations of all our prisoner-of-war camps have long been informed to the US side, although all our prisoner-of-war camps have long been set up obvious signs in accordance with the agreement, the US military aircraft still repeatedly bombed and strafed our prisoner-of-war camps, killing and wounding their own captured personnel, causing a serious threat to the lives and safety of their own captured personnel, who have jointly protested to them for this reason. Isn't this an indisputable fact?

Observers here point out that in his reply to the US side on June 17, our Chief Representative General Nan Ri accused the US side of bombing and strafing US captured personnel in our Changcheng No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp and Jiangdong No. 8 prisoner-of-war camp five times on January 14, March 16, May 4, May 5, and May 11, 1952. Not only has the US side never accounted for the above incidents, but it has even intensified its actions, dropping a large number of germ-carrying ants in the residential areas of our Changcheng "Tiancangmian" No. 3 prisoner-of-war camp and Bitong "Yunshimian" No. 7 prisoner-of-war camp on June 6 to poison their own captured personnel. A US prisoner of war, Bixley, from our No. 3 prisoner-of-war camp, became ill from poisoning while participating in the capture and destruction of germ-carrying ants. Twenty-four hours later, he suffered from dizziness, coma, stomach pain, and vomiting, and his body temperature rose to 40.2 degrees Celsius. He is currently being treated in our prisoner-of-war camp hospital. Many US prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camp witnessed the incident and were outraged by the US imperialists' crime of dropping bacteria and even poisoning their own captured personnel.

Observers believe that although the US representatives shamelessly shout about "humanitarian principles" and "prisoner of war welfare" in the conference tent, their own acts of violating humanitarian principles and undermining prisoner of war welfare ruthlessly expose their hypocritical masks and expose their hideous faces as murderers.

    开城观察家评美方轰炸我方战俘营的暴行
    【新华社开城十九日电】美方首席代表哈利逊在十五日经其联络官提交我方一封所谓“抗议”信，诬指我方战俘营没有设置标志。这是美方所惯用的狡赖伎俩的又一次表演。我方首席代表南日将军对这一“抗议”已在六月十七日复函美方严正拒绝。
    此间观察家认为，在谈判会议中，美方代表对其屡次屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行始终未作交代，对其屡次轰炸与扫射我方战俘营，打死打伤他们自己被俘人员的事件也始终未作交代。为了转移公众的视线，掩饰自己的罪行，美方便制造我方战俘营没有设置标志的谎言。然而美方代表煞费苦心地想出来的一切阴谋诡计，却一再被铁的事实所粉碎。对方企图用这一“抗议”来指控我方不遵守协议，而为其自己屡次破坏协议的行为作掩护。但自今年一月二十三日双方协议在各自的战俘营设立标志以后，我方各战俘营都立即按照协议中所规定的长短、宽窄、式样、颜色、文字，丝毫不差地设置了标志。三月一日在第四项议程的小组委员会会议上我方代表李相朝将军即已将这一事实告知美方；三月二十九日在双方参谋人员关于战俘营位置与标志的会谈中，我方参谋人员又一次明告美方，我方各战俘营早已按照协议设置了标志。这次美方却又以其首席代表出面，对这一问题装腔作势地向我方提出所谓“严重而强硬的抗议”。但是，这种毫无事实根据的谎言，除了遭受我方的拒绝与世人的耻笑之外，绝不会再起什么作用。
    此间观察家指出：美方提出这一“抗议”的另一企图，是想借指控我方不关心战俘的安全，来冲淡他们对我方被俘人员恣意屠杀的滔天罪行。然而对方所搬起的这块石头，却偏偏又打了他们自己的脚。因为事实证明使美方被俘人员的“平安与安全处于危险之中”的不是我方而正是美方。虽然我方所有战俘营的确实位置都早已告知了美方，虽然我方所有战俘营都早已按照协议设置了显明的标志，但是，美方的军用飞机却仍一次再次轰炸和扫射我方战俘营，打死打伤他们自己的被俘人员，使他们自己被俘人员的生命与安全遭受严重的威胁，并曾为此联名向他们提过抗议。难道这不是千真万确的事实吗？
    此间观察家指出：我方首席代表南日将军在六月十七日致美方的复函中，指斥美方曾于一九五二年一月十四日、三月十六日、五月四日、五日及五月十一日，五次轰炸与扫射我方昌城一号战俘营与江东八号战俘营中的美方被俘人员。美方不仅对上述各次事件从未作过交代，甚至更变本加厉，于六月六日在我昌城“田仓面”三号战俘营与碧潼“云时面”七号战俘营住地投掷大量带菌蚂蚁，毒害其自己的被俘人员。我三号战俘营一美军俘虏毕克斯莱在其参加捕灭带菌蚂蚁时中毒生病，二十四小时后即头晕、昏迷、肚痛、呕吐，体温曾升至摄氏四十点二度，现正在我战俘营医院治疗中。该战俘营许多美军俘虏目睹此事经过后，对美帝国主义投掷细菌以至毒害自己被俘人员的罪恶怒不可遏。
    观察家认为：尽管美方代表在会议帐篷内还恬不知耻地高喊什么“人道原则”、“战俘福利”，然而他们自己的违反人道原则、破坏战俘福利的行为，却无情地戳穿了他们伪善的假面，而使他们杀人凶犯的狰狞面目暴露无遗。
