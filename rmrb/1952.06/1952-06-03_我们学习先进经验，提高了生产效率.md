    We Increased Production Efficiency by Learning from Advanced Experience
    To the Editor: The workers in the foundry workshop of the Taiyuan Machine Factory used to work in a single shift, handling mold making, casting, and sandblasting, resulting in chaotic production. Whenever molten iron was released, workers from all groups crowded around the furnace to wait for casting, wasting more than a quarter of their work hours each day. Because of the unreasonable labor organization, even skilled workers were doing odd jobs, which greatly reduced work efficiency. To complete their tasks, workers often worked overtime. They deeply felt that this operating method was unreasonable, so they learned from the advanced Soviet experience and tried to change the work to two shifts, with the first shift making molds and the second shift casting, implementing specialized division of labor. In the initial trial, some workers felt uncomfortable, thinking, "If I make the mold, there is no guarantee that the other people will cast it well," and "If defective products come out, the responsibility cannot be clearly defined." However, after joint research by workers and technicians, operating procedures were drafted, and these ideological concerns were swept away. The operating procedures stipulated that defective products caused by sand flushing or air pockets were the responsibility of the mold-making workers; defective products caused by unsuitable iron water temperature or poor quality were the responsibility of the casting workers. After the workers in the foundry workshop implemented this operating method, production efficiency generally increased by more than 25%, and the quality was also greatly improved. Zhang Suojin's group, which made hoist drums, used to make only one piece a day, which still needed processing; now they complete two pieces a day and feel relaxed. The workers deeply realized that only by actively learning from advanced experience can we truly improve work efficiency.

    我们学习先进经验，提高了生产效率
    编辑同志：太原机器厂熔铸车间工人，过去都在一班内工作，既要造模，又要浇铸和打砂，生产秩序很混乱。每当出铁水时，各组工人纷纷拥到炉前等待浇铸，每天浪费工时在四分之一以上。因为劳动组织不合理，技术工人也做杂活，工作效率很低。工人们为了完成任务，经常加班加点赶活。他们深感这种操作方法不合理，就学习苏联先进经验，想办法把工作改为两班，头班造模，二班浇铸，实行专责分工。在试行之初，有些工人感到不习惯，认为：“我造模，别人浇铸不保险”，“出了废品，责任划不清。”但是，经过工人和技术人员的共同研究，拟订了操作规程，这些思想顾虑都一扫而光了。操作规程规定：因冲砂、窝气而造成的废品，由造模工人负责；因铁水温度不适宜或质量不好而造成的废品，由浇铸工人负责。熔铸车间工人实行了这个操作法以后，生产效率普遍提高百分之二十五以上，质量也大大提高。张锁金小组做卷扬机滚筒，过去一天只做一件还得加工，现在一天完成两件，还感到轻松。工人们都深深体会到：只有积极学习先进经验，才能真正提高工作效率。        彭谨
