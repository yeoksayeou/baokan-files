Thirteen. After the pests were eliminated, the cotton seedlings grew more than a foot tall. But it still didn't rain, and the cotton was very dry. Gao Guandou mobilized the masses to use the method of "watering stealthily" to save the cotton seedlings.

Fourteen. In order to increase production as much as possible, Gao Guandou also researched a method of intercropping cotton and wheat. The whole village widely used this method. In this way, in addition to the usual cotton harvest, an extra season of wheat can be harvested.

Fifteen. Because the farmers of Dahu Jia Village transformed the alkaline land and overcame drought and pests under the leadership of Gao Guandou, the cotton harvest was abundant. In the past, each mu of cotton field only produced more than 100 jin, but now it has increased to more than 200 jin. At the same time, grain production has also greatly increased.

    十四、为了多多增产，高贯斗又研究出了一种棉麦兼种的方法。全村普遍用了这个方法。这样，除了棉花照样收获外，还可多收一季麦子。
    十五、大护驾庄的农民因为在高贯斗的领导下改造了碱地，战胜了旱灾、虫灾，所以棉花获得丰收。过去每亩棉田只产一百多斤，现在增加到二百多斤，同时粮食的产量也大大增加了。
