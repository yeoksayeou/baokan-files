To the Editor:

There are many unreasonable phenomena in the production and operation of the Guye Bauxite Mine under the Hebei Provincial Mining Bureau. This has seriously affected the rational mining of the state-owned mine and the lives of the workers.

The mine lacks a comprehensive mining plan and only uniformly purchases bauxite dug by workers. The mine lacks specific technical guidance for the workers, allowing them to dig blindly, which is extremely detrimental to the large-scale mining in the future. The ore dug by the workers blindly often does not meet the standard quality, and the mine often refuses to accept it or purchases it at a reduced price, which is a great loss to the workers and makes them very dissatisfied.

The price of bauxite at the mine is too low. Although a preliminary adjustment was made last November, the adjusted price is still very unreasonable when compared to the price of finished products (ceramics). For example, the price of a set of toilets is equivalent to more than four tons of its main raw material, "Zimujie" clay; the market price of five small teapots is equivalent to one ton of "Zimujie" clay; the price of a ten-foot-long cylinder pipe is equivalent to four and a half tons of its main raw material, "Luan Ganzi" clay. Because the price of raw materials is too low, private merchants are using large quantities of high-grade clay, which is extremely important for national economic construction and has limited reserves, to replace low-grade clay in the manufacture of general daily necessities. Alkali stone and alkali "gan", which are essential for making high-voltage electromagnetic and acid-resistant equipment, are currently being used to make toilets, seriously wasting the country's economic construction resources.

The wages of the mine workers are very low. The mine buys the bauxite from the workers and then sells it, taking one-third or two-fifths of the selling price to pay the workers' wages, and the rest is used as the mine's production and management expenses and profits to be turned over. The average wage of workers is about 250,000 to 300,000 yuan per month, which is much lower than the wages of general manual laborers in other industrial and mining enterprises in Tangshan; and the wage gap with workers in the private ceramics industry in Tangshan (whose raw material is bauxite) is even greater. Since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, bauxite has been sluggish in sales, and the mine has stopped buying the bauxite dug by the workers, making the workers' lives even more difficult. Many workers in the Fangezhuang mining area rely on loans or selling belongings to make a living; some workers from other places, who have no family property and no way to borrow money, have no choice but to scavenge coal cinders, pick up vegetable leaves, or even beg for a living with their families. The Tangshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has allocated 40 million yuan to help the workers of the factory, but this does not solve the fundamental problem.

We suggest that the Hebei Provincial Mining Bureau quickly strengthen its leadership over the mine, improve the mine's production and operation, and appropriately improve the workers' living standards.

    古冶矾土矿的生产和经营有很多不合理现象
    编辑同志：河北省矿务局所属古冶矾土矿，在生产和经营方面，有很多不合理的现象，这已经严重地影响了国家矿场的合理采掘和工人的生活。
    该矿没有全面的开采计划，只是统一收购工人挖掘的矾土。矿方对工人缺乏生产技术上的具体指导，任凭工人盲目开掘，这对国家将来的大规模开采极为不利。工人盲目挖掘的矿土，往往不合标准质量，矿方常常不收或降低价格收购，工人吃亏很大，也很不满意。
    该矿矾土价格过低，虽然在去年十一月曾作初步调整，但把原料（矾土）价格和成品（陶瓷）价格相比，就可看出调整后的价格仍很不合理。例如大便器每套的价格，相等于其主要原料紫木节土四吨多；五把小茶壶的市价，相等于一吨紫木节土；一丈长缸管价格，相等于其主要原料乱矸子土四吨半。因为原料价格过低，私商就大量使用对国家经济建设极为重要而蕴藏量不多的高级粘土，代替低级粘土制造一般日用品。本来是制高压电磁和耐酸器材必不可缺的碱石、碱矸，在目前却被用来制大小便器，严重地浪费了国家经济建设的资源。
    该矿工人工资很低。矿方把工人的矾土买了来，然后售出，提出售价的三分之一或五分之二，发给工人作工资，其余即作为矿方生产管理费等项开支及上缴利润。工人平均工资每月约二十五万元至三十万元，比唐山市其他工矿一般体力劳动者的工资低很多；和唐山市私营陶瓷业（其原料即矾土）工人工资悬殊更大。“三反”、“五反”运动以来，矾土滞销，矿方不收工人所掘的矾土，工人生活就更困难了。范各庄矿区许多工人就靠借贷或出卖什物来维持生活；某些来自外地的工人，没有家业，借贷无门，只好一家老少检煤渣、拾菜叶，甚至行乞度日。唐山市总工会曾拨款四千万元救济该厂工人，但这并不能解决根本问题。
    我们建议河北省矿务局迅速加强对该矿的领导，改善该矿生产和经营情况，并适当提高工人生活。
