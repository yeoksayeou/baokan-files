Party Life

Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Haitao

In a mine in Pingxiang Coal Mine, the reporter met Guo Qingsi, who pioneered the national record for coal mining with a hand pick. In the light of the safety lamp, the reporter saw him swinging his pick at the coal seam. Coal dust sprayed all over him with each strike, and water dripped on him from the roof, but this warrior, who was increasing wealth for the country on the labor front, paid no attention to any of this. He was preparing to lead the whole group to create an advanced record in celebration of the 31st anniversary of the Communist Party of China.

Guo Qingsi was born into a poor peasant family in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. He joined the Communist Party of China in March 1949 (shortly before the liberation of Pingxiang Coal Mine). Under the education of the Party, he quickly became a heroic fighter. In April 1949, the reactionary authorities of the mining area stopped paying wages to all miners. The underground Party organization led the workers to strike and hold protest demonstrations. Guo Qingsi became the backbone of the strike team. Ignoring the reactionary army's shooting, he carried a rock drill and walked at the front of the team, leading the masses forward. Later, when the Kuomintang bandits were preparing to flee and conspiring to sabotage the Pingxiang mining area, Guo Qingsi actively launched a mine protection movement under the leadership of the underground Party organization. He carried a hammer and iron bars, standing on the mountain above the mine shaft, on guard against the enemy.

After the liberation of the mining area, the Party called on Party members to lead the working masses to fight for the restoration and development of production. Guo Qingsi modeled the implementation of this new task.

When the increase production and practice economy movement was launched last October, Pingxiang Coal Mine faced a series of difficulties. Most of the mine's extraction areas were not yet mechanized and still used hand picks for mining; and the workers still followed the old methods of mining, which were very inefficient. Therefore, how to fully exploit the potential of coal mining under the existing backward equipment conditions became a pressing problem to be solved. Young Communist Party member Guo Qingsi bravely took the responsibility of solving this problem on his shoulders. In order to produce more coal, he strengthened the intensity of his labor day after day. But despite being exhausted, the efficiency of coal mining did not improve much. This situation made Guo Qingsi restless. He thought day and night that only by improving the method of hand pick mining could the problem of increasing coal production for the country under backward equipment conditions be solved.

Guo Qingsi, a young miner with a short history of coal mining and not much experience, began his research on improving the working method of hand pick mining. After each shift, he would lie on the table at home, draw many crooked patterns, and think repeatedly. After entering the shift, he would test his research results. Several experiments failed, but he was not discouraged. In order to overcome difficulties, he inquired everywhere about the advanced experience of other workers. Once, he heard that Feng Jiali and other workers in Wangjiayuan Mine had made some improvements in coal mining operations, so he traveled more than ten miles overnight, crossing mountains and ridges, to learn on the spot, but he did not encounter Feng Jiali's duty time. So the next day he went again.

In order to improve the hand pick mining method, Guo Qingsi, after repeated research and experimentation, finally discovered the law of improving coal mining efficiency. At first, he discovered that not creating a notch or creating a very shallow notch when mining would affect the speed. He made an exception to create a nine-inch deep notch in the waist of the coal seam, and the work efficiency greatly increased. Then he suspected: Was the scope of each mining too short? Because the place was too small, the coal haulers could not haul coal when mining, and the coal miners could not mine coal when hauling coal. It was said that they worked eight hours per shift, but actually only worked four or five hours. He thought that if the scope of each mining was extended, this phenomenon could be eliminated. He put forward this opinion and discussed it with other workers, and conducted experiments. As a result, not only was the previous idleness eliminated, but also the pressure of the roof was fully utilized, and the mining efficiency was improved. In this way, Guo Qingsi successfully completed a series of experiments to improve the working method of hand pick mining. When everyone was troubled by the fact that the efficiency of hand pick mining could not be improved rapidly at the end of last November, Guo Qingsi used his new method to create a new national record of 79 tons of coal mined in one shift with a hand pick. This event quickly shocked the entire mine and powerfully criticized the conservative thinking of some employees at that time who believed that hand pick mining could not be improved. The emergence of Guo Qingsi's new record in hand pick mining brought the new record movement that was rising in the entire mine to a new climax. Other worker brothers learned from Guo Qingsi and created many new national records for hand pick mining one after another. In two or three months, the maximum efficiency of hand pick mining in Pingxiang Coal Mine increased from ten tons and twenty tons to more than 170 tons. Since January of this year, most of the working faces mined by Guo Qingsi are the hardest special-grade coal seams that even air picks cannot penetrate. In this kind of coal seam, previously a worker could only mine one to two tons of coal in a shift, but for several months, Guo Qingsi has always mined eight to nine tons of coal per shift.

The successful creation of Guo Qingsi's new hand pick mining method is an important contribution to the increase production and practice economy movement in China's coal mining industry. The Pingxiang Coal Mine Advanced Experience Promotion Committee has made a special summary of Guo Qingsi's achievements, and based on his experience, has formulated a new advanced hand pick mining method and operating procedures. This new method is named "Guo Qingsi Hand Pick Mining Method."

In his usual work, Guo Qingsi always remembers that he is a Communist Party member and always demands himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member. Guo Qingsi volunteered to work in places where the roof was not good or there was too much dripping water, which ordinary workers were reluctant to go to. Repairing crushed sheds is a very dangerous thing. Guo Qingsi always told others to stand far away and drilled in to repair it himself.

Guo Qingsi went to Beijing this year to attend the "May 1st" celebration and had the opportunity to meet worker representatives from various countries. The Korean workers hugged him tightly. The British worker brothers shook his hand tightly and told him that the wages earned by British workers could not afford a set of clothes a year other than food. Guo Qingsi further realized the important significance of his work from his contact with these international worker brothers. In Beijing, Li Fuchun, a member of the Party Central Committee and deputy director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, told him to make every effort to reduce the cost of coal. Guo Qingsi kept this sentence firmly in mind. After returning to the mine, the first thing he did was to lead the masses to carry out a stone picking movement (this can improve the quality of raw coal and reduce costs). At present, this movement has been enthusiastically launched in his mine. In the past, the stone content of each ton of raw coal in the mine reached 80 kilograms, but the group where Guo Qingsi is located has recently reduced it to less than 10 kilograms. In order to welcome the 31st anniversary of the Party, Guo Qingsi is currently preparing for various activities to create new records. He is determined to lead the workers of the whole group to create several new records of important value before the "July 1st" festival.

    青年共产党员郭清四
    新华社记者  张海涛
    在萍乡煤矿的一个矿井里，记者会到了首创手镐采煤全国新纪录的郭清四。借着安全灯的光亮，记者见他正挥动着手镐劈向煤层。煤灰随着劈刺直向他身上喷射，滴水顺着顶板打在他的身上，可是，这个在劳动战线上为祖国增加财富的战士，对这些一点不加理睬，他正准备带动全组为迎接中国共产党的三十一周年纪念创造先进纪录。
    郭清四生在湖南省湘潭县的一个贫农家庭里，在一九四九年三月（萍乡煤矿解放前不久）参加了中国共产党。在党的教育下，他很快地成为一名英勇的战士。一九四九年四月，矿区反动当局停发全体矿工的工资。党的地下组织领导工人起来罢工，并举行抗议示威。郭清四就成了罢工队伍中的骨干。不顾反动军队开枪射击，他扛着岩尖，走在队伍的最前面，带动群众前进。以后不久，国民党匪帮准备逃窜，阴谋破坏萍乡矿区时，郭清四又在党的地下组织领导下积极地发动护矿运动。他带着铁锤铁棍，站在矿井上面的山头上警戒着敌人。
    矿区解放以后，党号召党员要领导工人群众为恢复和发展生产而斗争。郭清四又模范地执行了这个新任务。
    去年十月增产节约运动展开时，萍乡煤矿面临着一系列的困难。矿的多数回采区尚未机械化，仍用手镐采煤；而工人们在采煤时又沿袭着旧的方式，效率很低。因此，如何在现有落后的设备条件下高度发挥采煤方面的潜在能力，就成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。青年共产党员郭清四勇敢地把解决这个问题的责任放到了自己的肩上。为了多出煤，他曾一天又一天地加强劳动强度。但尽管他累得精疲力竭，采煤效率并未提高很多。这种情况使得郭清四坐卧不安。他日夜思想，觉得只有改进手镐采煤方法，才能解决在设备落后的条件下，为祖国增产煤炭的问题。
    采煤历史不久、经验还不丰富的青年矿工郭清四，开始了他的改进手镐采煤工作方法的钻研。每次出班以后，他就伏在家里的桌子上，划出许多歪歪拉拉的图案，反复思索。进班以后，他就把自己的研究结果加以试验。几次试验都遭到失败，但他毫不气馁。为了克服困难，他到处打听其他工人的先进经验。有一次，他听到王家源矿场工人冯家礼等在采煤的操作方面有了若干改进，就连夜翻山越岭步行十余里赶去实地学习，但却没有碰到冯家礼等的当班时间。于是在第二天他又照样去跑了一趟。
    郭清四为了改进手镐采煤法，经过三番五次地研究、试验，终于发现了提高采煤效率的规律。最初他发现了采煤时不掏槽口或槽口掏得很浅，会影响速度。他就破例地在煤层腰部掏了一道九公寸深的槽口，工作效率果然大大增加。接着他又怀疑到：每次采掘的范围是否太短了一些？由于地方太小，采煤时拖煤工不能拖煤，拖煤时采煤工又不能采煤，说的是每班工作八小时，实际上只做了四、五小时的工作。他想，如果延长每次采掘的范围，一定能消除这种现象。他提出这个意见和其他工人商量，并进行了试验，结果：不仅消灭了从前存在的窝工现象，而且充分地利用了顶板的压力，提高了采掘效率。就是这样，郭清四胜利地完成了改进手镐采煤工作法的一系列的试验。当去年十一月底大家正苦恼着手镐采煤效率不能迅速提高的时候，郭清四运用他的新的方法，首创了一个工作班采煤七十九吨的手镐采煤全国新纪录。这件事迅速地震动了全矿，有力地批判了当时某些职工认为手镐采煤不能提高的保守思想。郭清四手镐采煤新纪录的出现，把全矿正在兴起的新纪录运动，带上了新的高潮。其他工人兄弟向郭清四学习，接二连三地创造许多手镐采煤全国新纪录。两、三个月中，萍乡煤矿手镐采煤的最高效率由十吨、二十吨提高到一百七十多吨。今年一月以来，郭清四采掘的工作面绝大多数是连风镐也打不进的最坚硬的特号煤层。在这种煤层中，从前一个工人在一班工作时间内只能采出一吨到两吨煤，但几个月来，郭清四每班采出的煤始终是八吨到九吨。
    郭清四新的手镐采煤工作法的创造成功，对我国煤矿工业的增产节约运动是一个重要贡献。萍乡煤矿先进经验推广委员会已对郭清四的成就作了专门的总结，并根据他的经验制订了一个新的先进的手镐采煤工作法和操作规程。这个新的方法被命名为
    “郭清四手镐采煤工作法”。
    在平常的工作中，郭清四时时刻刻都记住自己是个共产党员，总是用共产党员的标准要求自己。那个地方顶板不好或滴水过多，一般的工人不愿去的，郭清四就自告奋勇地到那里去工作。修理压碎了的棚子，是件很危险的事情。郭清四总是叫旁人站得远远地，自己钻进去修理。
    郭清四今年到北京参加“五一”节的观礼，有机会和各国的工人代表相见。朝鲜的工人们紧紧地拥抱着他。英国的工人兄弟紧紧地握着他的手，告诉他说：英国的工人得到的工资除了吃饭以外，一年买不起一套衣服。郭清四从和这些国际工人兄弟的接触中，更进一步体会到自己工作的重要意义。在北京，党的中央委员、中央人民政府财政经济委员会副主任李富春告诉他要尽一切努力降低煤的成本。郭清四紧紧记住这一句话。他回矿后，第一件事情就是带动群众开展检石头运动（这样可以提高毛煤质量，降低成本）。目前这种运动已在他的矿井里热烈展开。从前该矿每吨毛煤含石量达八十公斤，郭清四所在的组里最近已降到十公斤以下。为了迎接党的三十一周年诞辰，郭清四最近正进行着创造新纪录的各种准备工作。他决心要在“七一”节以前带动全组工人创造出几个有重要价值的新纪录。
