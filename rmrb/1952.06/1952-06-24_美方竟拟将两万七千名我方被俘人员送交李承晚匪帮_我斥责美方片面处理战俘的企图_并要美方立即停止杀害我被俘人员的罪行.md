Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 23rd: On June 22nd, the US side once again killed two of our captured personnel in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp. On the same day, the US headquarters announced that the US side was preparing to illegally classify 27,000 of our captured personnel as South Korean civilians and hand them over to the Syngman Rhee gang. At the meeting of the delegation of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations on June 23rd, General Nam Il, our chief representative, protested against the US side's killing of our captured personnel, pointing out that the other side has absolute responsibility for the safety of the prisoners of war under its custody, demanding that the other side immediately stop the crime of killing prisoners of war, and make a responsible explanation for the killings on June 22nd. Regarding the US side's attempt to unilaterally handle our captured personnel now held by the other side, General Nam Il pointed out: The repatriation of prisoners of war now held by the other side is being discussed in the negotiation meeting to seek a solution, and neither side has the right to unilaterally handle them. Our side has never recognized the other side's classification of our captured personnel as so-called detained civilians, and any attempt to unilaterally handle our captured personnel under this pretext is illegal and unreasonable, and our side absolutely cannot recognize it. General Nam Il resolutely demanded that the other side immediately abandon this unilateral and illegal attempt.

At the meeting on the 22nd, the other side once again claimed that it did not refuse consultation and was willing to seek an armistice. General Nam Il pointed out that consultation and seeking an armistice cannot just be empty words, but must be demonstrated by actions. In order to negotiate and resolve the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation on a reasonable basis and achieve a Korean armistice, our side has made many major efforts, and based on the agreement that both sides guarantee that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War, put forward a plan to allow prisoners of war from both sides to return home to live a peaceful life, even though the other side has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation within the outline of our plan. However, the other side has perfidiously overturned its clear expression and insisted on the illegal assertion of detaining prisoners of war, and has fundamentally refused to conduct any consultations since May 2nd, so that the armistice cannot be realized until now. General Nam Il finally pointed out that the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation must be resolved on the basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention, and our May 2nd plan is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation.

    美方竟拟将两万七千名我方被俘人员送交李承晚匪帮
    我斥责美方片面处理战俘的企图
    并要美方立即停止杀害我被俘人员的罪行
    【新华社开城二十三日电】二十二日美方又一次在巨济岛战俘营中杀害我方被俘人员二名，同日美方总部宣称：美方准备将二万七千名我方被俘人员非法分类为南朝鲜平民送交李承晚匪帮。二十三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军对美方杀害我方被俘人员事提出抗议，指出对方对其收容下的战俘的安全负有绝对的责任，要求对方立即停止杀害战俘的罪行，并对六月二十二日的杀害事件作负责的交代。对美方企图片面处理现在对方收容下的我方被俘人员事，南日将军指出：对方现在所收容的战俘的遣返问题，正在谈判会议中讨论求取解决，任何一方都无权对他们作片面的处理。我方从来没有承认对方将我方被俘人员分类为所谓被拘平民，任何企图以这种藉口来片面处理我方被俘人员的行为都是非法的、无理的，我方绝对不能承认。南日将军坚决要求对方立即放弃这一片面非法的企图。
    二十二日大会上对方又一次声称并不拒绝协商，愿意觅取停战。南日将军指出进行协商，觅取停战，不能只是一句空话，而必须用行动来表现。我方为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，达成朝鲜停战，已经作了多次重大努力，根据双方保证战俘不再参加朝鲜战争的协议，提出使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的方案，即使对方也曾一再表示愿在我方方案轮廓内解决战俘遣返问题。而对方背信弃义推翻自己的明确表示，坚持扣留战俘的非法主张，自五月二日以来根本拒绝进行任何协商，以致停战至今不能实现。南日将军最后指出战俘遣返问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决，我方五月二日方案是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。
