    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th – This agency's reporter commented on a ridiculously absurd commentary by Hudson published by the British Information Service:
    People all over the world now clearly see that the Korean armistice talks are in a dangerous stalemate precisely because the US side is attempting to detain a large number of our captured personnel using the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation." The British people and even people all over the world have expressed great anger at this behavior of the US side, which completely disregards human morality and international conventions. In order to continue to deceive the broad masses of the people in Britain, the British official propaganda organ, the British Information Service, is constantly manufacturing lies in an attempt to drown out the truth. The commentary "The Korean Prisoner of War Problem" by Hudson, published on the 2nd by the British Information Service, is just such a piece of falsehood, which, despite painstaking efforts, is still very unsuccessfully fabricated.
    Hudson first supports the absurd proposition of the so-called "voluntary repatriation" by the US side, which has brought the armistice negotiations to a standstill, calling it "a matter of principle," a matter on which "the United Nations side cannot retreat." Here, Hudson does not hesitate to abandon the solemn principle of the Geneva Convention, recognized by all civilized countries in the world, of repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice, thereby exposing himself as a supporter of the US side's deliberate delay and sabotage of the armistice negotiations.
    Hudson also defends the so-called "screening" by the US side in the commentary, but the lack of reason in this defense is very obvious, because as everyone knows, the so-called "screening" is a complete violation of the principles of the Geneva Convention and is therefore fundamentally unacceptable. The Geneva Convention stipulates that both sides of the war have an obligation to repatriate prisoners of war and does not contain any provisions for so-called "screening" of prisoners of war. Hudson obviously no longer dares to invoke or distort any articles of the Geneva Convention, and has to turn to trying to make people believe that the so-called "screening" by the US side is "carried out in fairness and good order." However, the confession of Colson, the former person in charge of the US prisoner-of-war camp, has revealed the truth of the so-called "screening" by the US side to the world, causing the US side to "lose face" greatly; in order to prove the "fairness" of the US side again, Hudson also echoes another absurd proposition of the US side of "re-screening." Hudson's tactic of using one absurd proposition of the Americans to defend another absurd proposition of the Americans is very ridiculous. Hudson estimates one consequence of "re-screening" saying that: "A considerable number of prisoners of war who originally refused repatriation have changed their minds and indicated that they are willing to go home," but Hudson does not dare to raise a question that everyone will ask: "Then who forced them not to want to go home in the first place? And how were they forced?" Hudson has to avoid talking about such a principled issue, and obviously does not dare to talk about it. This precisely confirms the thorough hypocrisy of the so-called "screening" and "re-screening" by the US side.
    In order to support the US side's demand for forcibly detaining our captured personnel, Hudson cited certain provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Hudson's attempt to use solemn international treaties to cover up the ugly criminal facts of the US side cannot but lead him into extreme logical confusion. On the one hand, Hudson seeks grounds for the US side's persecution and killing of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, saying that the 1949 Geneva Convention, which both the United States and Britain personally signed, is "not binding on the British or American governments," but on the other hand, he says that they "are eager to reaffirm that they recognize the principles of international law in conducting the Korean War" and are willing to abide by the 1949 Geneva Convention. Hudson's self-contradictory statement does not absolve the US side of any responsibility; it only further confirms the truth revealed in the confession of Colson, the former commander of the US prisoner-of-war camp, which is: the American aggressors, who claim to be "observers of the Geneva Convention," are "unrestrainedly" persecuting and massacring our captured personnel. It also proves that the United States and the British government have no intention of abiding by the Geneva Convention they signed, just as they have broken their promises and abandoned many other international agreements.
    In order to defend the bankrupt absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation," Hudson does not hesitate to distort the articles of the Geneva Convention. Hudson cannot deny that Article 118 of the Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities"; and Article 7 stipulates that "prisoners of war may not renounce the rights secured to them by the present Convention." But Hudson says that the rights conferred by this Convention are granted to "individual prisoners of war," not to countries, in order to defend the US side's forcible detention of our prisoners of war. Hudson is wantonly making the most shameless distortions here. Everyone knows that the reason why the Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war cannot renounce the rights conferred by the Convention is to protect the interests of prisoners of war, so that they will not be persecuted in prisoner-of-war camps and can return home to live peaceful lives after the end of hostilities. The Korean and Chinese sides' efforts to ensure the complete repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention are also precisely to protect these individual rights of prisoners of war. Hudson obviously cannot find an article in the Geneva Convention that grants prisoners of war the "right not to go home," so he has to distort the articles, saying that the US side's forcible detention of our captured personnel is a matter of "individual rights of prisoners of war," while the legitimate right of our captured personnel to be repatriated after the war is described as "ridiculously absurd." People can see that the one who is ridiculously absurd is none other than Hudson himself. Hudson emphasizes the "individual rights" of prisoners of war, as if the US side is truly a protector of the "individual rights" of prisoners of war. But what kind of individual rights has the US side given to prisoners of war? Just look at the truth of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp revealed by the US side itself, and you can know that the "individual rights" that the US side has given to our captured personnel are "insults, torture, forced writing of blood letters of protest, coercion, confinement, collective massacres, shootings and machine gun strafing, use of poison gas, germ weapons, subjects of atomic bomb experiments." In order to protect these "individual rights," according to Hudson, the US side has decided not to send our captured personnel back to their homeland for which they fought, but to rearm them and send them to the puppet regimes of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, the deadly enemies of the Chinese and Korean people whom they firmly oppose. Behind Hudson's beautiful curtain of "individual rights of prisoners of war" is being staged a bloody tragedy of forcibly arming prisoners of war, which is already a well-known fact. Who else can Hudson deceive?
    Hudson finally put forward another irrelevant argument, which is that the Geneva Convention does not deny the right of "political refugees" to reside in other countries. What does the right of asylum for political refugees have to do with the Geneva Convention, which stipulates the treatment and rights of prisoners of war? Which article of the Geneva Convention recognizes or mentions that prisoners of war should be regarded as political prisoners? Hudson knows he is in the wrong here, and does not dare to mention the word "prisoners of war," but his purpose is obviously to portray our captured personnel as political prisoners and prove that they should be detained based on such an absurd reason. Hudson's shameful attempt is to insert a serious political issue into the Korean armistice negotiations, going beyond the scope of the armistice negotiations that do not involve political issues. Hudson here reveals how ignorant he is. Hudson doesn't even know the scope of the Korean armistice negotiations, so what qualifications does he have to write a commentary on "the Korean prisoner of war problem"?

    新华社记者驳斥英新闻处一篇荒谬的评论
    【新华社开城七日电】本社记者评论英国新闻处发表的哈德逊的一篇荒谬绝伦的评论说：
    全世界人民现在已经清楚地看到，朝鲜停战谈判之所以陷于危险的僵局，就是因为美方企图用所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则扣留我方大批被俘人员。英国人民以至全世界人民对于美方这种完全蔑视人类道义和国际公约的行为，已经表示了极大的愤怒。为了继续欺骗英国国内的广大人民，英国的官方宣传机关英国新闻处正在不断制造谎言，企图淹没事实的真相。英国新闻处在二日发表的哈德逊所作的评论：“朝鲜的战俘问题”，就是这样的一篇纵然煞费苦心、但仍然制造得极不成功的谎言。
    哈德逊首先为美方这一使停战谈判陷于僵局的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张捧场，把它称做是“一个原则性的问题”，“联合国方面决不能退让的”问题。哈德逊在这里不惜背弃了全世界一切文明国家所公认的在停战后遣返全部战俘的日内瓦公约的庄严原则，从而暴露了自己乃是美方蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判的支持者。
    哈德逊在评论中同时为美方所谓“甄别”辩解，但这种辩解的毫无道理是十分显然的，因为尽人皆知，所谓“甄别”是完全违反日内瓦公约的原则的，因此根本是不能承认的。日内瓦公约上规定交战双方有义务遣返战俘，而并没有任何规定可对战俘进行所谓“甄别”。哈德逊显然再不敢援引或曲解日内瓦公约的任何条文，只好转而竭力想使人们相信美方的所谓“甄别”是“在公道和秩序良好的情况下进行的”。可是前美方战俘营负责人柯尔生的供词已经使美方的所谓“甄别”的真相大白于世，使美方在全世界大为“丢脸”；为了再度证明美方的“公道”，哈德逊又附和美方的另一个“重新甄别”的荒谬主张。哈德逊这种拿美国人的一个荒谬主张来替美国人的另一个荒谬主张辩护的手法，是十分可笑的。哈德逊估计“重新甄别”的一个后果说：“原来拒绝遣返的战俘中有相当一部分人改变了主意，表示他们愿意回家”，可是哈德逊却不敢提出因此人人要问的一个问题：“那么当初是谁逼迫他们不愿回家的呢？又是怎样逼迫他们的呢？”关于这样一个原则性的问题，哈德逊只好避而不谈，也显然不敢谈到。这就恰恰证实了美方的所谓“甄别”与“重新甄别”的彻头彻尾的虚伪性。
    为了支持美方的强迫扣留我方被俘人员的要求，哈德逊援引了一九四九年的日内瓦公约的某些条款。哈德逊这种用庄严的国际条约来掩饰美方丑恶的犯罪事实的企图，不能不使他自己陷于逻辑上的极度混乱。哈德逊一方面为美方迫害和虐杀朝中战俘罪行找寻根据，把美国和英国都亲自签了字的一九四九年日内瓦公约，说成是“对英国或美国政府都没有约束力的”，但另一方面却又说什么它们“渴望确申它们在进行朝鲜战争当中承认国际法的原则”，愿意遵守一九四九年的日内瓦公约。哈德逊这种自相矛盾的说法，丝毫不能替美方开脱什么责任，它只是更加证实了美国前战俘营长官柯尔生的供词中所透露出来的真情，这就是：以“日内瓦公约遵守者”自居的美国侵略者，正在“不受约束”地迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员。它也证明了美国和英国政府对于自己签了字的日内瓦公约根本就无意遵守，就像它们背信弃义地抛弃其他的许多国际协定一样。
    为了替已经破产了的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张辩护，哈德逊竟不惜曲解日内瓦公约的条文。哈德逊无法否认：公约第一一八条规定：“积极敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延”；第七条又规定，“不论在任何情况下，战俘不能声明放弃本公约所赋与的权利。”可是哈德逊说，这个公约所赋予的权利是给予“战俘个人”的，而不是给予国家的，以此来为美方的强迫扣留我方战俘辩解。哈德逊在这里肆意地作了最无耻的曲解。谁都知道，日内瓦公约之所以规定战俘不能放弃公约所赋予的权利，就是为了保护战俘的利益，使他们得以不致在战俘营中遭受迫害，并且在敌对行动结束以后能够回家重过和平生活。朝中双方根据日内瓦公约力争战俘全部遣返，也正是为了保护战俘的这种个人权利。哈德逊显然从日内瓦公约里找不到一条给予战俘以“不回家的权利”的条文，因此他只好曲解条文，把美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员说成是
    “战俘个人权利”，而把我方被俘人员在战后遣返回国的合法权利却说成是“荒谬绝伦”的。人们可以看到，荒谬绝伦的不是别人，正是哈德逊自己。哈德逊强调战俘的“个人权利”，好像美方真正是战俘“个人权利”的保护者似的。可是美方究竟给了战俘什么样的个人权利呢？只要看一看美方自己透露出来的巨济岛战俘营的真相，就可以知道美方所给予我方被俘人员的“个人权利”，就是“侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书抗议、威逼、禁闭、集体屠杀、枪杀和机关枪扫射、使用毒气、细菌武器、原子弹实验对象”。为了保护这种“个人权利”，按照哈德逊的说法，美方才决定不把我方被俘人员送回他们为之而战斗的他们的祖国，而把他们重新武装，送给他们所坚决反对的中朝人民的死敌——蒋介石和李承晚的傀儡政权去。在哈德逊的“战俘个人权利”的美丽的幕布后面，正在演出一出血淋淋的强迫武装战俘的惨剧，这已经是尽人皆知的事实，哈德逊还能欺骗得了谁呢？
    哈德逊最后提出了另一个风马牛不相及的论点，这就是日内瓦公约没有否认“政治逃亡者”在别国居住的权利。政治逃亡者的避难权和规定战俘的待遇与权利的日内瓦公约有什么相干呢？日内瓦公约的哪一条承认了或者提到了战俘应该算做是政治犯呢？哈德逊在这里自知理屈，不敢提到“战俘”字样，但他的目的显然企图把我方被俘人员说成是政治犯，并且根据这样荒谬的理由而证明应该扣留他们。哈德逊的可耻企图，就在朝鲜停战谈判中插进了一个严重的政治问题，越出了停战谈判不涉及政治问题的范围。哈德逊在这里暴露了他自己是多么无知。哈德逊连朝鲜停战谈判的范围都不知道，又有什么资格来写关于“朝鲜的战俘问题”的评论呢？
