Xinhua News Agency, 18th. People of various countries continue to angrily protest against the towering crime of the American aggressors' bloody massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The Central Executive Committee of the Association of Victims of Nazism in Berlin, on behalf of its members, sent a letter to the commander of the American sector of Berlin, strongly protesting against the barbaric massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the US military on Koje Island. The letter said: The American barbarians committed this shameful act, once again proving that they are the successors of the Hitler criminals. The Berlin branch of the German Democratic Women's League also wrote a similar letter to the commander of the American sector of Berlin.

The Central Committee of the Romanian General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the United Nations, representing the Romanian people in strongly protesting against the unprecedented crimes committed by the American aggressors against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island and other prisoner-of-war camps. The telegram stated: The heroism shown by the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, their love for their motherland and freedom, and their high morale vividly demonstrate that no method can turn Korean and Chinese patriots into tools of American imperialism. Together with hundreds of millions of kind people around the world, we firmly demand that the United Nations take measures to stop the towering crimes committed by the American imperialists against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace, the Fatherland Front, the Dimitrov People's Youth League, and other mass organizations held conferences and rallies throughout the country to protest against the bloody crimes of the British and American imperialists in Korea. The Bulgarian Democratic Women's Committee convened a large-scale mothers' meeting in Krumovgrad. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution stating: We mothers express our strong protest against the atrocities committed by the American imperialists against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. Even if these bloodthirsty generals use the most cruel methods, they cannot make Korean and Chinese prisoners of war stop loving their motherland or dispel their desire to return home.

The British Ex-Servicemen's Movement for Peace issued a statement on the 11th saying: "We believe that one conclusion is undeniable, that the events that occurred on Koje Island in violation of the Geneva Convention and humanity should be primarily the responsibility of the American authorities there." Many members of the association were prisoners of war. The association's statement said: The only way is to end the Korean War and unconditionally repatriate all prisoners. A group of dockworkers at London's Royal Docks wrote to Labor MP Jones about the Koje Island incident, saying: The use of flamethrowers against prisoners is completely unforgivable.

"We urge you to speak out against this crime to save our country's name and honor." Residents of the Alkilton Nen area of Scotland sent a telegram to MP McGuren saying: "The government must protest against the atrocities of the American army in massacring unarmed prisoners of war on Koje Island." Many people from all over Britain and the wives of British prisoners of war are preparing to go to London on June 25 to hold a large-scale petition and send representatives to meet with Churchill to demand a ceasefire in Korea. A prisoner's wife wrote to the National Women's Conference saying: "I firmly advocate that every prisoner captured in the Korean War should be sent back to avoid any further misfortune." According to London's "Worker's Daily," Labour MPs held a meeting on the 11th, where many MPs unanimously condemned the US for waging the Korean War and massacring prisoners on Koje Island. Attlee and other former ministers were also criticized for condoning Eden's wholehearted support of the US action in Korea. They demanded that Britain send representatives to the ceasefire negotiations and immediately stop the Korean War. One speaker argued that if the US refused Britain's demands, they should fight to withdraw troops from Korea.

The Pakistani newspaper "Today" strongly protested against the atrocities of the American interventionist army on Koje Island. "Today" wrote: The atrocities committed by the US military against unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island are unprecedented. The US military has blatantly violated the provisions of international agreements regarding the humane treatment of prisoners of war. "Today" called on all freedom-loving people to force the American imperialist warmongers to stop their atrocities.

    世界各国人民继续抗议美军屠杀战俘
    【新华社十八日讯】世界各国人民继续愤怒地抗议美国侵略者血腥屠杀朝中战俘的滔天罪行。
    柏林受纳粹之害者协会的中央执行委员会，代表它的会员致函柏林美占区司令，强烈地抗议美军在巨济岛野蛮屠杀朝中战俘。该信说：美国野蛮人干出这种可耻的勾当，再一次证明了他们是希特勒罪犯的继承者。德意志民主妇女联盟柏林分会也写了一封类似的信给柏林美占区司令。
    罗马尼亚总工会中央委员会致电联合国，代表罗马尼亚人民强烈抗议美国侵略者对巨济岛及其他俘虏营中的朝中战俘所犯的空前罪行。电文中说：朝中战俘所表现的英雄主义、对祖国和自由的热爱以及高昂的士气，生动地说明了：任何方法都不能使朝中爱国者变为美帝国主义者的工具。我们与全世界亿万善良人民一道，坚决要求联合国采取措施，制止美帝国主义者对朝中战俘所犯的滔天罪行。
    保加利亚保卫和平全国委员会，祖国阵线，季米特洛夫人民青年联盟及其他群众组织在全国各地举行大会和集会，抗议美英帝国主义者在朝鲜的血腥罪行。保加利亚民主妇女委员会在克鲁莫夫格拉德召开了一次大规模的母亲会。会上一致通过决议称：我们母亲们对于美帝国主义者对巨济岛的朝中战俘所施的暴行表示强烈的抗议。即使这些嗜血的将军们采用最残酷的方法，也不能使朝中战俘不爱他们的祖国或打消他们的回家的热望。
    英国退伍军人保卫和平运动协会于十一日发表声明说：“我们认为有一个结论是不可否认的，就是在巨济岛上发生的违反日内瓦公约和人道的事件，主要应当由那里的美国当局负责。”该协会有许多会员曾当过战俘。该协会的声明说：唯一的办法是结束朝鲜战争，无条件遣返全部俘虏。伦敦皇家码头的一群搬运工人曾就巨济岛事件写信给工党议员琼斯说：对俘虏使用喷火器是完全不可饶恕的行为。
    “我们要求你大声疾呼，反对这种罪行，以挽救我国的名声和荣誉。”苏格兰阿尔基尔顿嫩地方的居民曾打电报给议员麦古伦说：“政府必须对美国军队这样虐杀巨济岛上的没有武装的战俘的暴行表示抗议。”英国各地的许多人和英国战俘的妻子准备在六月二十五日到伦敦去举行大规模请愿，并派代表会晤邱吉尔，要求实现朝鲜停战。一个战俘妻子写信给全国妇女大会说：“我坚决主张在朝鲜战争中被俘的每一个俘虏应当被放回去，以免我们再遇到任何不幸。”另据伦敦“工人日报”载称，工党议员于十一日举行会议，会上许多议员一致指责美国进行朝鲜战争和虐杀巨济岛俘虏的行为。艾德礼以及其他前任大臣也因纵容艾登死心蹋地支持美国在朝鲜的行动而受到批评。他们要求英国派代表参加停战谈判，立即停止朝鲜战争。有一个发言人主张，如果美国拒绝英国的要求，他们应当为撤退在朝鲜的军队而斗争。
    巴基斯坦报纸“今天报”强烈抗议美国干涉军在巨济岛的暴行。“今天报”写道：美军对巨济岛上赤手空拳的朝中战俘的暴行是史无前例的。美军已经明目张胆地违反了国际协定中关于用人道精神对待战俘的规定。“今天报”号召一切爱好自由的人民迫使美帝国主义战争贩子停止他们的暴行。
