Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: Recently, enemy troops launched two landing incursions on the West Coast, but were swiftly repelled by our vigilant coastal defense forces. At 6:00 AM one day, over eighty enemy troops aboard three wooden boats attempted to land at Fenghuo-ri, southeast of Yan'an. They were immediately met with a head-on attack by our coastal defense forces and fled back to the sea. At 10:30 AM the same day, over fifty enemy troops aboard four wooden boats again attempted to land in the Gan Zhi-ri area south of Haeju, but were once again driven back by our troops.

The enemy's small-scale incursions on the front lines have also been met with resolute counterattacks from our forces. One day, two platoons of enemy troops sneaked into a certain location southeast of Jin City and were driven back by the intense gunfire of our outpost troops. At 6:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, a small outpost team of our East Line forces repelled two consecutive incursions by enemy troops at a certain location south of Changcheng-ri.

    我海防部队击退登陆敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线九日电】最近敌军在西海岸先后进行两次登陆窜扰，都被我警惕的海防部队迅速击退。一日六时，分乘三只木船的八十多名敌军，在延安东南烽火里登陆时，立即遭到我海防部队迎头痛击，向海上逃去。同日十时三十分，敌军五十多名，分乘木船四只，又在海州以南干智里地区登陆，仍被我军逐退。
    敌军在前线地面不断进行的小股窜犯，亦连续遭到我军坚决的回击。一日，敌军两个排窜至金城东南某处，被我前哨部队密集枪火击退。三日下午六时半，东线我军一支人数很少的前哨队，在长承里以南某处击退敌军连续两次窜犯。
