Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: The workers of state-owned and public mines and factories in Beijing, who are busily preparing to launch a large-scale production increase and thrift campaign, are greeting the 31st anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party with unparalleled enthusiasm.

Under the slogan of "Creating New Records to Greet the Party's Birthday," many factory and mine workers have set new records in production. The Chengzi Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau produced 1,056 tons of coal on the 24th and increased it to 1,200 tons on the 25th. The entire mine is striving for a daily output of 1,400 tons of coal. The national labor model Li Shuhe's production team, when carrying out rock excavation, originally planned to advance 2.5 meters per day but has now increased it to 3.7 meters per day. In the past, four shots were needed per cubic meter when blasting rock tunnels, but now only two shots are needed. Wang Xingmao, a worker in the weaving workshop of the Qinghe Woolen Mill, originally set a target of weaving 24 meters of No. 8 uniform serge per day, but has now increased it to 34 meters. In the fine spinning department of the factory, the original target was 16 meters of serge per worker per day, but now 40% of the workers are weaving 20 meters per day. The daily output of worker Zheng Dequan has even reached 27.8 meters, exceeding the original plan by 73%.

Workers in various mines and factories have expressed their determination to find more "tricks of the trade," formulate advanced production increase and thrift competition plans, and offer gifts to the Party. The workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have already found 143 "tricks of the trade" in May and June. The factory is now launching a movement to summarize and promote advanced experiences and has summarized seven advanced working methods that can be promoted. The workers of the Second Sewing Department of the Beijing Clothing Factory found ten "tricks of the trade" in just over ten days, which rapidly increased the total output. In the past, it took 45 minutes to sew 120 hat brims, but now it only takes 18 minutes. The workers of the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory are preparing to overfulfill the production increase and thrift plan and create another 16 billion yuan of wealth for the country. The employees of the Electromechanical Factory of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, based on the key problems in the factory's production, repeatedly discussed and researched, and found more than 30 "tricks of the trade" that can increase production and save a large amount of wealth for the country to greet the Party's birthday.

The workers showed their boundless love for the Chinese Communist Party in many concrete activities to greet "July 1st." Ma Wenhua and Zhao Wenxia, female workers of the First Sewing Department of the Beijing Clothing Factory, made an exquisite "longevity bag." They said to all the workers in the groups: "Whichever group is advanced in production, we will give this longevity bag to them, and they will give it to the Party branch on 'July 1st'." The workers of the First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 26th, reporting on the development of their factory since liberation. They pointed out in the letter that thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, since liberation, the production of their factory has developed, and the lives of the workers have improved day by day. In the early days of liberation, the factory only had a dozen old machines and twenty or so workers, and could only produce five sprayers per month. Now it has forty automatic lathes and more than 300 workers and can produce more than 10,000 sprayers per month. When the letter mentioned the changes in the lives of the workers, it said: "Before liberation, the Fu Qingbao family of five, who were machinists, couldn't even eat their fill of mixed noodles every day, and had no clothes to wear so they had to go naked; now the family has added two more people, not only can they eat their fill, but they can also eat refined grains every day, and their clothes can be changed on time, so Fu Qingbao often says: if it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have today's life."

    北京工人热烈增产迎接“七一”
   【新华社二十七日讯】正在紧张地准备开展大规模增产节约竞赛的北京国营、公营矿厂的职工们，以无比的热情来迎接中国共产党诞生三十一周年。
    在“创造新纪录迎接党的生日”的口号下，很多厂矿工人在生产上创造了新纪录。京西矿务局城子煤矿，二十四日产煤一千零五十六吨，二十五日即增至一千二百吨，该矿全体工人正为日产煤一千四百吨而努力。该矿全国劳动模范李书和生产小组，在进行岩石掘进时，原计划日进二点五公尺，现已提高到日进三点七公尺，从前炸石道时，每立方需放四个炮，现只放两个炮。清河制呢厂织机间工人王兴茂，织八号制服呢时，原订每天织二十四公尺，现已提高到三十四公尺；该厂精纺部原订一个工人每天织哔叽十六公尺，现在已有百分之四十的工人每天织二十公尺，工人郑德全日产量更达到二十七点八公尺，超过原来计划百分之七十三。
    各矿厂工人均表示要多找“窍门”，订好先进的增产节约竞赛计划，向党献礼。华北农业机械总厂工人们，在五、六两个月份中，已找到“窍门”一百四十三个，现全厂又开展了总结推广先进经验运动，并已总结了七种可以推广的先进工作法。北京被服厂第二缝纫部工人，只用十几天功夫，即找出十个“窍门”，使全部产量迅速增加，过去用四十五分钟才能缝一百二十个帽沿，现在只用十八分钟。华北农业机械一分厂工人们，准备超额完成增产节约计划，再为国家创造一百六十亿元的财富。京西矿务局机电厂职工们，根据全厂生产中的关键问题，反复地讨论研究，找出三十多个可为国家增产节约大量财富的“窍门”，来迎接党的生日。
    工人们在迎接“七一”的许多具体活动中，表现着对中国共产党的无限的爱戴。北京被服厂第一缝纫部女工马文惠、赵文霞，做了一个精致的“寿袋”，她们对全部各组工人说：“谁的小组在生产上先进，我们就将这个寿袋送给他们，由他们在‘七一’那天送给党的支部”。华北农业机械一分厂工人，二十六日写信给毛主席，报告他们厂里自解放以来的发展。他们在信中指出，由于有了毛主席和共产党的领导，解放以来，他们工厂的生产发展了，工人的生活一天天地提高了。在解放初期，该厂只有十几部破旧机器和二十几个工人，每月只能生产喷雾器五架，而现在已有四十部自动车床和三百多工人了，每月可生产喷雾器一万多架。信里提到工人生活的变化时说：“解放以前车工傅庆宝全家五口人，每天吃混合面还吃不饱，没有衣服穿只好赤身露体；现在全家又添上两口人，不但能吃饱，每天还能吃上一顿细粮，衣服也能按时添换，所以傅庆宝常说：要不是共产党和毛主席领导，俺那有今天生活。”
