    People's Publishing House Decides to Strengthen Popular Reading Material Publishing

    To the Editors: The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 30th published a reader's suggestion, hoping that our publishing house would publish more books introducing the advanced experience of labor models in increasing production. We thank the readers for their suggestion.

    We have indeed not paid enough attention to the publication of popular reading materials in the past. We have decided to strengthen this work. Local people's publishing houses have done some work in this area; due to the differences in local specific conditions and language habits, the work of publishing a large number of popular reading materials will still be the responsibility of local people's publishing houses. Our publishing house is also preparing to publish some popular reading materials that are national in scope and of strong political significance, especially readings related to the increase production and practice economy movement. We hope that readers from all walks of life will constantly supervise and assist us.

    General Editorial Office of the People's Publishing House

    人民出版社决定加强通俗读物出版工作
    编辑同志：五月三十日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了读者的建议，希望我社多出版介绍劳动模范丰产经验的书籍。我们感谢读者的建议。
    我们过去的确没有重视通俗读物的出版工作。我们决定加强这一工作。各地人民出版社在这方面曾经做了一些工作；由于各地具体情况和语言习惯都有差别，大量出版通俗读物的工作，仍将由各地人民出版社负责。我社亦准备出版一些具有全国性的和政治性较强的通俗读物，特别是有关增产节约运动的读物。希望各方面的读者经常给我们督促和协助。
    人民出版社总编辑室
