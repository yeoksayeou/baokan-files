    The heroic Korean people have been waging a sacred war of liberation against the joint armed forces of the US-British aggressor bloc for two years.
    The war over the past two years has proven that the American rulers' plundering plan to enslave Korea, their meticulously planned and arrogant conspiracy to conquer the people of Asia, has been declared a shameful failure. Even though the American imperialists have assembled their main ground forces in Korea, and deployed a massive air force and navy, they have still suffered military defeat. The myth of the "invincibility" of the American army has been completely shattered. The American aggressors have also suffered moral and political defeat. The pain of colonial oppression suffered by the Korean people for half a century is still fresh in their minds. They deeply hate foreign aggressors and absolutely cannot tolerate the American colonialists throwing a nation that has already tasted the fruits of freedom back into a state of enslavement. A nation that loves freedom, when it rises up to fight for its own glory and freedom, for its own national independence, even if it is a small nation, it is invincible and will surely triumph. This fact is now even more clearly demonstrated to the world.
    The new robbers who vainly attempt to dominate the world are trying to maintain and establish new war bases in Asia, to extend their barbaric medieval rule in South Korea to the entire Korean peninsula and beyond, and to try to intimidate the people of colonial and dependent countries, suppressing the strong will of the people of colonial and dependent countries to fight for national liberation; but all these attempts by the robbers who vainly attempt to dominate the world are in vain. The ugly face of the American aggressors has been fully exposed in Korea and has been cursed by honest people all over the world.
    The big capitalists in capitalist countries need war. They need to maintain tension, need war hysteria, need an abnormal economic boom, so that they can sell their goods at high prices and make a fortune from the bloody war that destroys entire nations. Capitalists, landlords, and merchants see war as a business opportunity to grab huge profits. Therefore, the American munitions monopoly giants are trying to maintain their maximum profits, turning the armistice negotiations into a farce staged in blood, and have already dragged out the negotiations for a year. At the same time, the American imperialists are madly restoring West Germany and Japan as centers of war, violating the will of the people, and concluding militarist treaties with the imperialist and revanchist groups in these countries.
    The American tycoons who made a fortune in the two world wars have even turned the "great" capitalist countries into their vassals. At present, the American imperialists have become even more shameless. They rudely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and in collusion with Britain and other partners, are openly preparing for a new world war for the bloody profits of a few.
    As early as 1918, Lenin said: "Britain and the United States are in a better position than other countries to remain democracies, but now we see that these two countries, like the former Germany, are extremely barbaric and rampant, and therefore they will soon, even more quickly, come to the tragic end of German imperialism. At first, Germany expanded its territory very rapidly, occupied three-quarters of Europe, and swelled up, but soon it exploded, leaving only a repulsive stench. British and American imperialism are accelerating towards such an end."
    The American imperialists have turned the factories and workshops, educational institutions, hospitals, cities and villages of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea into ruins. They used a large number of chemical and bacteriological weapons to massacre human beings, and equipped their troops with fleas and lice carrying plague and typhoid germs. But despite these heinous atrocities committed by the American interventionists in Korea, they are still unable to realize their sinister plans, just as they were two years ago.
    The US-British imperialists have turned their troops in Korea into executioners who strangle freedom, into the police force of the capitalist world that is hated by all honest people. The war in Korea is extremely unpopular with American and British soldiers, because those American and British officers and soldiers who have not lost their conscience and morality have realized the injustice of this war. At the same time, the predatory nature of the Korean War, the search and plunder of other countries, will inevitably create a group of professional robbers and murderers who completely lack moral concepts in the "United Nations army."
    The liberated Korean people, on the contrary, are completely different. Their lofty ideal of resisting foreign aggression and defending the motherland has inspired the heroism and self-sacrifice of the broad masses. The power of the freedom-loving Korean people is truly infinite, and their confidence in victory is incomparably firm. Their sacred goal of defending the honor, freedom, and independence of their beloved motherland has united the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic forces across the country into a fighting whole, united around their organizer and inspirer, the Korean Workers' Party and its leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung. In the war against the American aggressors, the Korean army has demonstrated outstanding combat effectiveness and moral qualities. The quantity and quality of the army are increasing day by day, and the equipment is also being improved. The war has also shown the outstanding organizational ability of the Korean army's command personnel. The rear of the Korean army is more consolidated than in the past. The front and the rear have shown indestructible unity, which is a very important factor in winning the victory of the war.
    The great Chinese people have sent their heroic volunteers to aid Korea; they are determined to fight to the end to defend the borders of their newly reborn motherland and to defend the fraternal Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The 500 million people of People's China have universally ignited the raging fire of anger at the American imperialists' actions of occupying Taiwan and infringing upon the freedom and independence of the new China.
    In their just struggle, the heroic Korean people have received great moral support from the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, the German Democratic Republic, and all progressive mankind.
    The Soviet Union has consistently and firmly implemented its peace policy, exposing the conspiracies of the warmongers. It firmly defends the rights of all countries, large and small – the right to decide their own internal affairs, and opposes any actions that interfere in other countries. The Soviet Union has repeatedly made suggestions, and if these many suggestions had been adopted, Korea would have achieved peace long ago. More than a year ago, the Soviet representative to the United Nations proposed holding armistice negotiations in Korea. Under the urging of world opinion, this Soviet proposal was adopted, but the American army deliberately delayed the progress of the negotiations. There is no doubt that if the US-British imperialists finally reject the peace proposals of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then "the Korean War," as Comrade Stalin pointed out as early as February 1951, "can only end in the failure of the interventionists."
    The World Federation of Trade Unions, uniting 80 million workers from all countries of the world, has issued a call to the working people, calling on everyone to regard June 25, 1952 – the second anniversary of the Korean War – as the international day of active solidarity with the heroic Korean people, as the day of defending peace. This call has received a warm response from honest people all over the world. The actions of honest people all over the world against the mad atrocities of the American aggressors and striving to end the Korean War have become increasingly resolute.
    The large-scale marches, demonstrations and strikes of the working people in France and Italy show how much the people of the two countries hate the American aggressors, and show how great the power of the working people in supporting the fighting Korean people is.
    The Communist and Workers' Parties are mobilizing all progressive and peace-loving forces to give a resolute counterattack to the mad dog-like US-British imperialists who are inciting a new world war, so as to thwart all their conspiracies to enslave the people of all countries. The Communist and Workers' Parties believe that it is their unshirkable responsibility to tell the general public the truth about Korea, to stop the American intervention, to punish the war criminals, and to thoroughly expose the American imperialists' bloody conspiracies to endanger peace and humanity.

    朝鲜人民的正义事业必然胜利
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论
    英雄的朝鲜人民进行神圣的解放战争，反抗美、英侵略集团的联合武装部队已经两年了。
    两年来的战争证明：美国统治者奴役朝鲜的掠夺计划，他们处心积虑企图征服亚洲人民的狂妄的阴谋，已经宣告可耻地失败了。美国帝国主义者纵然在朝鲜纠合了它主要的地面部队，出动了庞大的空军和海军，但仍然遭受了军事上的失败。所谓美国军队“万能”的神话已经完全破产了。美国侵略者在道义上和政治上也遭到了失败。朝鲜人民半世纪以来备受殖民地压迫的痛苦，这种痛苦的印象现在仍然非常新鲜的留在朝鲜人民的心目中，他们极端仇恨外国侵略者，绝对不能容忍美国殖民者把一个已经尝到了自由生活的果实的民族再度抛到被奴役的境地去。一个爱好自由的民族，当它为自己的光荣与自由，为自己的民族独立而奋起战斗的时候，即使是一个小民族，它也是无敌的，必然要胜利的。这一事实，现在已经更加清楚地向全世界表现出来了。
    新的妄图统治世界的强盗们力图在亚洲保持并建立新的战争基地，把他们在南朝鲜的野蛮的中世纪的统治扩展到整个朝鲜半岛和朝鲜以外去，极力想恐吓殖民地和附属国家的人民，压制殖民地和附属国家人民争取民族解放斗争的坚强的意志；但是妄图统治世界的强盗们的这一切企图都是徒然的。美国侵略者的狰狞面目已经在朝鲜暴露无余，并遭到了全世界正直人士的咒骂。
    资本主义国家的大资本家需要战争。他们需要保持紧张状态，需要战争歇斯底里，需要经济上的变态繁荣，这样就可以以高价出售他们的商品，可以从毁灭整个民族的血腥战争中大发其财。资本家、地主和商人们把战争看作是攫取暴利的生意经。因此，美国的军火独占巨头们力图保持他们的最高额利润，把停战谈判变成了在血泊中上演的滑稽剧，并已经使谈判拖延了一年。同时，美帝国主义者疯狂地把西德和日本恢复成为战争的中心，违反人民的意志，与这些国家的帝国主义和复仇主义集团缔结军国主义的条约。
    在两次世界大战中发了横财的美国富豪们，甚至把“大”资本主义国家也变成了他们的附庸。目前，美帝国主义者已经变得更无耻了。他们横蛮无理地干涉其他国家的内政，并且串同英国及其他伙伴，为着少数人的血腥利润，公开地准备新的世界战争。
    早在一九一八年列宁就说过：“英国和美国比其他国家有更好的条件使自己仍然成为民主国家，可是现在我们见到这两个国家也和从前的德国一样，极端野蛮和猖狂，因此，它们也将很快地甚至更快地走到德国帝国主义的悲惨结局。起初，德国非常迅速地扩张领土，占有了欧洲的四分之三，膨胀起来了，但不久即行爆炸，只留下一股令人憎恶的臭气。英国和美国帝国主义就正在加速地走向这样一个结局。”
    美国帝国主义者把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工厂和作坊、教育机关、医院、城市和乡村化为一片废墟。他们使用了大批屠杀人类的化学武器和细菌武器，用带有鼠疫菌和伤寒菌的跳蚤和虱子来装备自己的部队。但是，尽管美国干涉者在朝鲜干出了这些罪恶滔天的暴行，现在他们却依然和两年前一样，无法实现他们的罪恶计划。
    美英帝国主义者已经把他们在朝鲜的军队变成了扼杀自由的刽子手，变成了一切正直人士所痛恨的资本主义世界的宪兵队。朝鲜的战争对于美国和英国的士兵是极端不得人心的，因为，那些还没有丧尽天良和道义的美英官兵已经认识到这个战争的非正义性。同时，朝鲜战争的掠夺性，对于别的国家的搜劫与掠夺，就一定会在“联合国军队”中制造出一批完全缺乏道德观念的职业强盗和杀人凶犯。
    已经获得解放的朝鲜人民则完全相反，他们抵抗外国侵略保卫祖国的崇高思想激发了广大群众的英雄主义和自我牺牲的精神。爱好自由的朝鲜人民的力量是真正无穷无尽的，他们对胜利的信心无比坚定。他们要保卫自己可爱的祖国的荣誉、自由和独立，这一神圣的目的已经把全国的工人、农民、知识分子和一切爱国力量团结成一个战斗的整体，团结在他们的组织者和鼓舞者——朝鲜劳动党及其领袖金日成同志的周围。在反对美国侵略者的战争中，朝鲜军队表现了卓越的战斗力和道德品质。军队的数量和质量在日益增长，装备也在改进中。战争也显示了朝鲜军队指挥人员的卓越的组织能力。朝鲜军队的后方比过去更加巩固了。前线和后方表现了不可摧毁的团结统一，这对于赢得战争的胜利是一个非常重要的因素。    伟大的中国人民派遣他们英勇的志愿军援助朝鲜；他们为保卫已经获得新生的祖国的边疆，保卫兄弟国家朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，决心战斗到底。人民中国的五亿人民对于美国帝国主义者侵占台湾、侵犯新中国的自由和独立的行动，普遍地燃起了愤怒的烈火。
    英雄的朝鲜人民在他们的正义斗争中，获得了苏联、中华人民共和国、人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国各国人民以及一切进步人类的伟大的道义上的支援。
    苏联一贯地坚定地实行它的和平政策，揭露战争贩子们的阴谋。它坚决地维护一切大小国家的权利——自己决定国家内政的权利，反对任何干涉他国的行动。苏联曾经一再地不断地提出建议，如果这许多建议被采纳，朝鲜老早就已经获得和平了。一年多以前，联合国的苏联代表提议在朝鲜召开停战谈判。在全世界舆论的督促之下，苏联这个建议是被采纳了，但是美国军队却蓄意拖延谈判的进行。毫无疑问，如果美、英帝国主义者终于拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中国人民志愿军司令部的和平建议，那末，“朝鲜战争，”正如斯大林同志早在一九五一年二月所指出的，“便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”
    团结着世界各国八千万职工的世界工会联合会，已经向劳动人民发出号召，呼吁大家把一九五二年六月二十五日——朝鲜战争两周年纪念日——当作国际积极声援英雄的朝鲜人民日，当作保卫和平日。这一号召获得了全世界正直人民热烈的响应。全世界正直人民反对美国侵略者的疯狂的暴行、争取结束朝鲜战争的行动，已越来越坚决了。
    法国和意大利劳动人民的声势浩大的游行示威和罢工运动，显示了两个国家的人民是多么的仇恨美国侵略者，显示了劳动人民声援战斗的朝鲜人民的力量是多么的伟大。
    共产党和工人党正在动员一切进步的和爱好和平的力量，对煽动新的世界战争的疯狗般的美、英帝国主义者给予坚决的反击，从而挫败它们奴役各国人民的一切阴谋。共产党和工人党认为：把朝鲜的真相告诉一般人民、制止美国的干涉行动、惩办战争罪犯、彻底揭露美国帝国主义者危害和平与人类的血腥阴谋——这一切，是它们义不容辞的责任。（转载自“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”总第一八九期）
