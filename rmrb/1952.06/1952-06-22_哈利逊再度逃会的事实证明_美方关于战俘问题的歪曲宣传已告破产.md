Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 21st (Special Correspondent Report): Harrison's second unilateral announcement of a three-day recess of the armistice talks further demonstrates that since Joye proposed the "firm, final, and unchangeable proposal" in April of this year, the U.S. attempt to forcibly decide the terms of the armistice at the negotiating table has failed.

The U.S. side forcibly put forward this "final proposal" and refused to negotiate, bringing the armistice negotiations to a complete standstill. This attitude of refusing to seek any further progress marks the culmination of the U.S. tactics of delaying and sabotaging negotiations. They have used delaying and sabotaging tactics to drag out the armistice negotiations for eleven months and eleven days. Now, their last resort to obstruct the realization of the Korean armistice is to repeatedly chant the old tune of "firm, final, and unchangeable," and then run away.

The negotiations are already very close to the armistice. As long as the U.S. has the slightest sincerity to negotiate at the negotiating table on an equal footing, the negotiations will be completed smoothly. Taft recently said that the United States should slowly drag on in Korea until the production of military materials is developed on a large scale. It is very obvious that in order to achieve this goal, the U.S. negotiators do not even dare to sit down and pretend to negotiate, because how the two sides negotiate to solve the remaining POW issue is taking the final step towards seeking a Korean armistice.

Harrison's retreat further illustrates the embarrassing situation the U.S. representative has fallen into after the U.S. propaganda fraud on the POW issue went bankrupt. Harrison's last retreat was precisely at the time when the U.S. was carrying out bloody suppression of POWs on Geoje Island. Harrison's second unilateral announcement of a recess this time is also when Bonner is sending tens of thousands of POWs to other islands to "clear" Geoje Island. They are doing this in order to quietly send away these witnesses who have personally seen the bloody massacre behind the scenes of "voluntary repatriation."

The U.S. claims are vulnerable and untenable. The U.S. representatives do not even dare to discuss the compromise solution to the POW issue put forward by the Korean and Chinese representatives, or let their own journalists report this compromise plan to the public. American reporters in Panmunjom have not even seen the full text of the letter from Generals Kim Il-sung and Peng Dehuai to Clark this time.

The "propaganda" that Harrison said he did not want to hear is nothing but the provisions of the Geneva Convention on the repatriation of all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities. Specifically, this means that after the armistice, all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as U.S., British and other foreign prisoners of war, should be repatriated without delay to return to their families. Korean prisoners of war whose homes are within the territory of the detaining party can go home and do not need to be repatriated. All other Korean prisoners of war must be repatriated so that they can return home to live peaceful lives.

The reason why Harrison retreated is because he is afraid that the people of the world will remember that the U.S. government is violating the Geneva Convention and preventing prisoners of war on both sides from returning home to live peaceful lives. This has become a means for the United States to evade the Korean armistice negotiations.

### 哈利逊再度逃会的事实证明  美方关于战俘问题的歪曲宣传已告破产

    哈利逊再度逃会的事实证明
    美方关于战俘问题的歪曲宣传已告破产
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者报道：哈利逊第二次片面宣布停战会议再度休会三天，这更加有力地说明了：自从乔埃在今年四月提出“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的方案”以来，美方想在会议桌上强行决定停战条件的企图已经失败了。
    美方强行提出这个“最后的方案”并且拒绝协商，使停战谈判完全陷于停滞状态。这种拒绝再谋求任何进展的态度，标志着美方拖延和破坏谈判的手段已达到登峰造极的地步。他们已用拖延和破坏手段使停战谈判拖了十一个月零十一天。现在，他们阻挠朝鲜停战实现的最后手段就是一再重复“坚定的、最后的、不能改变的”老调，说完就逃走。
    谈判已经十分接近停战，只要美方有丝毫在会议桌上根据平等原则进行谈判的诚意，谈判就会顺利完成。塔夫脱最近说，美国应当在朝鲜慢慢拖，直到军事物资的生产大规模发展起来的时候为止。很明显，为了达到这个目的，美方谈判代表甚至不敢坐下来装着谈判的样子，因为双方谈判怎样解决剩下来的战俘问题就是在谋求朝鲜停战方面迈进最后一步。
    哈利逊的逃会进一步说明在美方关于战俘问题的宣传骗局破产之后，美国代表已经陷于怎样狼狈的处境之中。哈利逊上次逃会正是在美方对巨济岛战俘实行血腥镇压的时候。哈利逊这次再度片面宣布休会，也是在波纳把成千上万的战俘送到其他岛上去以“清理”巨济岛的时候。他们这样做是为了把这些亲眼看见“自愿遣返”幕后的血腥屠杀的见证人悄悄地送走。
    美方的主张是一触即破、站不住脚的。美方代表甚至不敢讨论朝中代表就战俘问题提出的折衷解决办法，或让他们自己的新闻记者向公众报道这个折衷方案。板门店的美国记者甚至没有看到过金日成和彭德怀两将军这次致克拉克的信的全文。
    哈利逊所说的他不愿听的“宣传”，不是别的东西，正是日内瓦公约中关于敌对行动停止后遣返一切战俘的条文。具体说来，这就是在停战以后，应毫不迟误地遣返中国人民志愿军的一切被俘人员以及美英和其他外国战俘，让他们回国与家人团圆。朝鲜战俘家在拘留一方的地域内者，可以回家，不必遣返。一切其他朝鲜战俘都必须予以遣返，让他们回家过和平生活。
    哈利逊所以逃会，是因为他害怕世界人民想起美国政府正在破坏日内瓦公约，不让双方战俘回家过和平生活。这已成为美国逃避朝鲜停战谈判的手段。
