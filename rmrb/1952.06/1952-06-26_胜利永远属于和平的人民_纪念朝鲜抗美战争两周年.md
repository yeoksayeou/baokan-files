The American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea a full two years ago. In these two years, the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has dealt a very heavy blow to the American aggressors and the small group of warmongers who follow them. According to statistics from October 1950 to April this year, over 520,000 so-called United Nations forces in Korea were annihilated, including approximately 230,000 American soldiers, and the loss of over 4,400 aircraft and 1,600 tanks. In the first year of the war alone, American imperialism consumed more than 15 million tons of war materials, more than double the consumption in the first year of the Pacific War; military expenditures reached over 10 billion US dollars, more than double the military expenditure in the first year of World War II.

Two years ago today, American imperialism launched its war of aggression from the "38th parallel." After two long years and suffering such heavy losses in manpower, materials, and financial resources, it is still on the "38th parallel" today. Its heinous plan to destroy Korea and enslave the entire Korean people has been shattered; its conspiracy to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism and attack the Chinese mainland has been shattered; and its extreme cruelty and extreme shamelessness have been exposed without reservation. In the Korean armistice negotiations, on the only remaining issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, it still stubbornly insists on absurd claims such as "voluntary repatriation" and "screening," and uses all kinds of cruel and shameless means to abuse and persecute our captured personnel. These are all conclusive evidence, known to the world, and admitted by the personnel who carried out the American imperialists' evil plans and by news agencies and newspapers serving American imperialism. Although American imperialism shamelessly makes all kinds of defenses, the facts cannot be changed by absurd and sophistical arguments.

American imperialism habitually steals terms such as "friendship," "peace," "humanity," and "aid" to deceive the world, but now they are becoming less and less effective. No matter how good American imperialism is at embellishing and sophistry, people will know what it actually does. Just before and after the U.S. government illegally declared the unilateral peace treaty with Japan "effective," and just before and after the bacteriological warfare criminal Ridgway arrived in Paris, the people of the world issued unparalleled cries of anger. On Labor Day, three million people in Japan launched an unprecedented heroic demonstration in more than 480 locations across the country; since April, Japanese workers have held three general strikes to oppose the treasonous treaty and rearmament. Powerful cries of protest echoed everywhere in Paris and other parts of France: "Ridgway get out!" "Bacteriological murderers get out!" Even after the treasonous governments of Japan and France, under the instructions of their American masters, carried out bloody suppression and illegally arrested a large number of patriots, demonstrations and strikes continued to rage. May 26th was the signing date of the so-called "General Treaty" between the U.S., Britain, France, and the Bonn traitorous government of West Germany, and the demonstrations and protests of the people throughout West Germany also reached a new climax. This is enough to prove that American imperialism is extremely weak and a complete paper tiger; at the same time, it also fully proves that the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has greatly exceeded the strength of the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism. The American imperialists' evil conspiracy to dominate the world and enslave the people of the world through a third world war will be difficult to achieve. Marshal Stalin's reply to an American journalist on March 31 this year, pointing out that the third world war is not closer than it was two or three years ago, is the best annotation of this fact.

Of course, the lessons American imperialism has learned are not enough. Although it accepted the Korean armistice negotiations after being beaten black and blue, it is not sincere. It constantly creates provocative incidents and insists on unreasonable demands, plotting to delay, obstruct, and disrupt the negotiations in order to maintain a tense international situation and intensify its arms expansion and war preparations; rearming Japan and West Germany under the guise of a unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the "General Treaty"; organizing the European Army; establishing the Middle East Command, the Nordic Council, and the Mediterranean Pact; and signing bilateral agreements with Latin American countries, are all deployments for launching a new world war. This is something we must be highly vigilant about. The closer imperialism gets to its dead end, the more frantically it struggles, and the more despicable and shameless it becomes, anything can be done. The crimes of American imperialism committing inhumane bacteriological warfare and using chemical weapons in Korea and Northeast China since January this year are clear evidence.

The great wave of peace is rising! The common will to love peace and defend peace has united the people of the world, regardless of race, belief, national system, or political views, in an unprecedented way. The World Peace Congress held in Warsaw, the International Economic Conference held in Moscow, and the recent preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing are all manifestations of the unprecedented growth of the world's peace forces. We believe that as long as we strengthen unity and intensify the struggle, peace will surely triumph over war, and victory will always belong to the people of peace.

We extend our highest respect to the Korean and Chinese People's troops who defend their homeland and defend peace!

We extend our highest respect to the people of the world who oppose aggression and strive for peace and democracy!

    胜利永远属于和平的人民
    ——纪念朝鲜抗美战争两周年  马叙伦
    美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，已经整整两周年了。在这两年中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇作战已经给予美国侵略者和追随它的一小撮战争贩子以十分沉重的打击。仅就一九五○年十月到今年四月十八个月的统计，在朝鲜的所谓联合国军即被歼灭五十二万人以上，其中美军约占二十三万人，损失飞机四千四百架以上，战车一千六百辆。还在战争的第一年里，美帝国主义就消耗了一千五百多万吨的战争物资，超过它在太平洋战争第一年的消耗量一倍以上；消耗军费达一百亿美元以上，比第二次世界大战第一年的军费要多一倍。
    两年以前的今天，美帝国主义从“三八线”上发动它的侵略战争，经过两年的长时间，遭受人力、物力、财力如此惨重的损失，今天它还是在“三八线”上。它的灭亡朝鲜、奴役全朝鲜人民的罪恶计划被粉碎了，它的妄想走日本帝国主义的老路进攻中国大陆的阴谋被粉碎了，它的极端残暴和极端卑鄙无耻也暴露无遗了。而在朝鲜停战谈判中仅剩的一项遣返战俘问题上，它却仍旧横蛮无理地坚持“自愿遣返”、“甄别”等荒谬主张，施用种种残暴无耻的手段，虐待和迫害我方被俘人员。这都是证据确凿、举世共知的，也是执行美帝国主义罪恶计划的人员亲口供认，和为美帝国主义服务的通讯社、报刊直认不讳的。尽管美帝国主义还厚颜无耻地百般辩解，但是事实不是荒诞的理屈词穷的辩解所能改变的。
    美帝国主义惯常窃用“友谊”“和平”“人道”“援助”等名词欺蔽世人，但是现在是越来越不中用了。不论美帝国主义如何善于巧饰、诡辩，人们都会知道它实际做的什么事。就在美国政府非法宣布片面对日和约“生效”的前后，就在细菌战犯李奇微到达巴黎的前后，全世界的人民发出无比的愤怒呼声。日本三百万人民在五一劳动节那天，在全国四百八十多处地方，展开了空前的英勇示威；四月以来，日本工人已举行了三次总罢工，反对卖国条约，反对重新武装。巴黎和法国其他各地到处响起强大的抗议的呼声：“李奇微滚出去！”“细菌杀人犯滚回去！”就在日本和法国卖国政府接受美国主子指使实行血腥镇压、非法逮捕大批爱国者以后，示威游行和罢工运动还是如火如荼地进行。五月二十六日是美、英、法和西德波恩卖国政府缔结所谓“一般性条约”的签字日，西德全境人民的示威和抗议也达到了新的高潮。这就足够证明美帝国主义是极其虚弱的，是一个地道的纸老虎；同时，也充分地证明了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量已经大大超过以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营的力量。美帝国主义妄图独霸世界、奴役世界人民的第三次世界大战的罪恶阴谋将很难得逞。今年三月三十一日斯大林大元帅在答复美国记者时指出第三次大战比之两三年前不是更临近，这个事实正是最好的注解。
    当然，美帝国主义所受的教训还不够。它虽然在被打得头破血流之后，接受了朝鲜停战谈判，但它是没有诚意的。它不断制造挑衅事件和坚持无理主张，阴谋拖延、阻挠和破坏谈判，就是为保持紧张的国际局势，以加紧扩军备战；在片面对日和约和“一般性条约”的幌子下重新武装日本和西德；组织欧洲军；搞中东司令部、北欧理事会、地中海公约；和拉丁美洲各国订立双边协定等，都是为了发动新的世界性战争的部署。这是我们必须提高警惕的。帝国主义越是到了穷途末路，越是疯狂挣扎，越发卑鄙无耻，什么事都会作出来的。从今年一月以来，美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行灭绝人性的细菌战和使用化学武器的罪行，就是明证。
    和平的巨浪高涨起来了！爱好和平、保卫和平的共同意志，使全世界人民不分种族、信仰、国家制度及政治见解，都史无前例地走向团结。在华沙举行的世界和平大会，在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议，以及最近在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，都是全世界和平力量空前壮大的表现。我们相信只要加强团结，加紧斗争，和平一定能够战胜战争，胜利永远属于和平的人民。
    谨向保卫祖国、保卫和平的朝中人民部队致崇高的敬礼！
    向全世界反对侵略争取和平民主的人民致崇高的敬礼！
