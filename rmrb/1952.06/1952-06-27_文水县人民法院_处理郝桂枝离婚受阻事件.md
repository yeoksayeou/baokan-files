Handles Obstruction of Hao Guizhi's Divorce

Editor: The incident "Village Cadres in Beihujiabao Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province Seriously Violate the Marriage Law and Infringe on Human Rights" published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on May 21st has been resolved by relevant parties. After this incident occurred, the district people's government immediately went to handle it, completed the divorce procedures for Hao Guizhi and Zhang Mingze, and reported it to the Wenshui County People's Court. The Wenshui County People's Court immediately sent personnel to the village to investigate, arrested and interrogated the relevant criminals. Now, sentences have been determined according to the crimes committed by each: the main culprits, Wang Suoheng and Wang Chengding, deliberately undermined the Marriage Law and were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment; Wang Si'er and Wang Houxiao, arbitrarily committed assault, illegally bound and detained people, and were each sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment. Accomplices such as Li Shaotang were also given disciplinary actions.
