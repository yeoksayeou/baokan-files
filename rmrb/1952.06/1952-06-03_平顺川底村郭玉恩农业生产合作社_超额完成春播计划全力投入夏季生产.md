    Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun
    Exceeds Spring Planting Plan and Fully Enters Summer Production
    After the agricultural production cooperative led by Guo Yu'en in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, challenged the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative led by Li Shunda, and issued a challenge to farmers in the entire special district (Changzhi Special District), they launched a patriotic production increase campaign. They continuously carried out patriotic ideological education and received a production award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, which further improved their political awareness and enthusiasm for labor. By May 18, they had already exceeded their spring planting plan ahead of schedule. They then convened a meeting of cooperative members to summarize spring production. Because of its past achievements and solid foundation, their agricultural production cooperative has expanded from eighteen households to forty-six households this spring. After the organization was appropriately expanded, the advantages of the agricultural production cooperative became even more apparent.
    1. More land was invested, which made it easier to implement unified planning, collective management, and rational planting, so as to maximize land efficiency. Last year, there was less land, and it was still relatively scattered. Only eleven small plots were combined into four large plots, removing seven field boundaries and expanding the cultivated land by five-tenths of a mu. This year, the land has increased by 163 percent, and sixteen small plots have been combined into seven large plots, further expanding the cultivated land by 1.3 mu. This makes it easier to use new-style farm tools. This year, new-style walking plows were used to cultivate sixty mu of land, achieving deep plowing. The entire cooperative now has 242 mu of autumn fields, and the millet fields and high-yield corn fields have all been plowed, harrowed, and raked three times each. Ordinary corn fields have been plowed, harrowed, and raked twice each, achieving fine harrowing and raking to preserve soil moisture and timely sowing. All millet was sown using two-legged seed drills. According to the needs of the country and themselves, the entire cooperative planted four crops: millet, corn, potatoes, and hemp. This further broke the limitations of the small-scale peasant economy of "planting whatever is eaten" compared to last year.
    2. Expanding the organization also increased the investment power for expanded reproduction. They newly added fifty-five publicly owned sheep, and also concentrated the fifty-two sheep already owned by the cooperative members. They also used the valuation method to absorb the manure accumulated by the members as investment. This greatly increased the amount of fertilizer applied this year. The original plan was to apply 105 dan of fertilizer per mu, but the actual amount applied was 125 dan, which was 20 dan more than the original plan and 33 dan more than last year. For the fifteen mu of high-yield land, 160 dan of base fertilizer were applied per mu, and 200 dan were applied to three mu, creating the highest record of fertilizer application in the entire village. Last year, Guo Yunkao and other seven households only applied an average of 50 dan of fertilizer per mu. This year, they joined the cooperative, which eliminated this imbalance in fertilizer application and enabled more land to increase production. After the fertilizer was used in a concentrated manner, it was also easier to apply fertilizer according to local conditions and better exert the effectiveness of the fertilizer. This laid the foundation for increased grain production this year.
    3. More people joined the cooperative, which made it easier to implement unified allocation and rational division of labor, and the strengths of each person were easier to give play to. For example, Li Xicun and others specialized in leading seed selection, Guo Haixian and others specialized in managing seed drills, and Guo Haibao and others specialized in managing plows. In the transportation of fertilizer, they adopted the contract system, and labor efficiency increased by 50 percent compared to the past. They also organized a busy season nursery, allowing nineteen women with children who had never participated in major agricultural labor to participate in agricultural production and actively participate in the competition. Together with the seventeen women who had participated in agricultural production in the past, they completed a total of 220 workdays in the spring. As a result of the unified and rational use of labor by the entire cooperative, a total of 372 workdays were saved in plowing, fertilizer transportation, and dam construction in the spring. The remaining labor was invested in land processing and sideline production. In transportation and other aspects, they earned 7,300 jin of rice; in afforestation, they planted 901 trees on 3.7 mu of terraced fields that could not be planted in the spring, exceeding the original plan (the original plan was to plant 1,239 trees throughout the year, with half completed in the spring).
    4. In collective production and under the patriotic ideological education, they further strengthened the habit of collective labor and improved their political awareness. The cooperative members cultivated sixty mu of land for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and cultivated it with even more care than their own land. They subscribed to thirteen newspapers and periodicals, organized five reading groups, and held "Patriotic Days" twice a month within the cooperative, revising the patriotic covenant three times. Fifteen young and middle-aged men in the cooperative actively practiced martial arts in the militia and were ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.
    They have already formulated a summer hoeing and seedling protection production plan: 130 mu of corn, 50 percent of which will be top-dressed with 20 dan of fertilizer per mu. The high-yield land will be top-dressed twice, with 40 dan per mu; of which three mu of corn will be top-dressed three times, with 160 dan per mu. The general millet land, 99 mu, will be hoeed three times universally, and the corn land will be hoeed twice; the high-yield millet of five mu will be hoeed four times, and the corn of ten mu will be hoeed three times. Wheat will be selected in the field; male flowers will be removed on three mu of corn land in preparation for seed selection. Attention should be paid to preventing and controlling various diseases and insect pests, and diseased plants should be removed in a timely manner. In addition, ten mu of beach land will be repaired, and 340 mulberry branches will be pressed; and ten laborers will be drawn to engage in various sideline occupations, earning 3,500 jin of rice, which will be invested in expanded reproduction. Now, they are carrying out summer production according to this plan, and further developing the patriotic production increase campaign. (Yang Zhiqin)

    平顺川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社
    超额完成春播计划全力投入夏季生产
    山西省平顺县川底村郭玉恩领导的农业生产合作社，向李顺达领导的农林畜牧生产合作社等应战，并向全专区（长治专区）农民提出挑战之后，就投入了爱国丰产竞赛运动。他们不断地进行了爱国主义思想教育，并受到中央人民政府农业部的丰产奖，政治觉悟和劳动积极性更进一步提高。到五月十八日，他们已经提前超额完成春耕播种计划。他们接着就召开社员大会进行了春季生产的总结。他们的农业生产合作社因为过去的成绩好，有坚实的基础，今春已由十八户扩大到了四十六户。组织适当地扩大了之后，农业生产合作社的优点就更明显地表现了出来。
    一、入股土地更多了，更便于统一计划、集体经营、合理种植，发挥土地效能。去年地少，仍比较零散，仅把十一小块合成四大块，去掉了七道地界，扩大耕地五分；今年土地增加了百分之一百六十三，十六小块合成了七大块，又扩大耕地一亩三分。这样，就更便于使用新式农具了。今年在六十亩地上用新式步犁耕地，做到了深耕。全社现在共有秋田二百四十二亩，谷子地和丰产玉茭地全部犁、耢、耙各三次，一般玉茭地犁、耢、耙各两次，都做到了细耙细耢保墒，适时下种。谷子全部是用两条腿耧播种的。根据国家和自己的需要，全社种植谷子、玉茭、山药蛋、大麻四种作物。这样就较去年更进一步地打破了小农经济的“吃啥种啥”的限制。
    二、扩大了组织，也就更增加了扩大再生产的投资力量。他们新增加了公有的羊五十五只，又集中了社员已有的羊五十二只，还用作价的办法把社员们积的粪肥吸收来作为投资。这样，就使今年的施肥量大大增加。原计划每亩施肥一百零五担，实际施了一百二十五担，比原计划多施了二十担，比去年多了三十三担；十五亩丰产地每亩底肥上了一百六十担，其中三亩上了二百担，创造了全村施肥量的最高纪录。去年郭云考等七户平均每亩只施肥五十担；今年他们入了社，就消除了这种施肥不平衡的现象，使更多的土地能够增产。肥料集中使用之后，也更便于因地施肥，更好地发挥肥料的效力。为今年粮食增产打下了基础。
    三、入社的人更多了，更便于统一调配，合理分工，每个人的特长更便于发挥。如李喜存等专门领导选种，郭海先等专管掌耧，郭海保等专管掌犁。在运送肥料中，他们采用了包工制，劳动效率比过去提高了百分之五十。他们还组织了农忙托儿所，使十九个从来不参加农业主要劳动的有小孩的妇女也投入农业生产，积极参加竞赛；和十七个过去就参加农业生产的妇女在一起，她们在春季共做了二百二十个工。全社统一地合理地使用劳力的结果，春季在耕作、运肥、垒堰等方面共省工三百七十二个。剩余的劳动力，投入了土地加工、副业生产等方面。在运输等方面，赚米七千三百斤；在造林方面，春季在三亩七分不能种植的梯田上植树九百零一棵，超过原计划（原计划全年植树一千二百三十九棵，春季完成一半）。
    四、他们在集体生产中和爱国主义思想教育下，进一步加强了集体劳动的习惯，提高了政治觉悟。社员给烈属军属代耕了六十亩土地，种得都比自己的地还多加工。他们订了十三份报纸刊物，组织了五个读报组，社内每月举行两次“爱国日”，修订了三次爱国公约。社员中有十五个青壮年在民兵队伍中积极练武，准备随时响应祖国的召唤。
    他们已经订出了夏锄保苗生产计划：玉茭一百三十亩，百分之五十要上追肥，每亩二十担。丰产地要上两次追肥，每亩四十担；其中三亩玉茭要上三次追肥，每亩一百六十担。一般谷子地九十九亩，要普遍锄三次，玉茭地要锄两次；丰产地谷子五亩要锄四次，玉茭十亩要锄三次。麦子要进行田间选种；在三亩玉茭地上要进行去雄，准备选种。要注意防治各种病虫害，及时拔除病株。此外，还要修滩地十亩，压桑条三百四十棵；并抽出十个劳动力搞各种副业，赚米三千五百斤，投入扩大再生产。现在，他们正照着这个计划进行夏季生产，进一步开展爱国丰产竞赛运动。　（杨志勤）
