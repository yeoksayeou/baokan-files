    Shandong Provincial People's Government Actively Solves Housing Problems for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel

    Editor: The preferential treatment work in Shandong Province has greatly improved since the "August 1st" major inspection last year. In order to solve the housing problems of poor families of martyrs and military personnel, governments at all levels mobilized the masses to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, and repaired and built many houses for the families of martyrs and military personnel. According to incomplete statistics from 18 counties (cities) including Rushan and Haiyang, more than 28,000 leaky houses were repaired and more than 990 new houses were built for families of martyrs and military personnel. This spring, the Shandong Provincial People's Government also notified the people's governments of all counties and the preferential treatment committees at all levels to seize the time after the wheat harvest and before the rainy season to continue to repair the collapsed or leaking houses of families of martyrs and military personnel, and strive to solve all the housing problems of families of martyrs and military personnel.

    山东省人民政府积极解决烈属军属的住房问题
    编辑同志：山东省的优抚工作，自去年“八一”大检查以来，大有起色。为了解决贫苦烈属军属的住房问题，各级人民政府动员群众发扬互助的精神，为烈属军属分别修补、新建了很多住房。据乳山、海阳等十八县（市）不完全的统计，曾经为烈属军属修补漏房二万八千多间，新建房屋九百九十多间。今年春天，山东省人民政府又通知各县人民政府和各级优抚委员会，抓紧麦收后、雨季前的时间，继续修补烈属军属倒塌或漏雨的住屋，争取全部解决烈属军属的住房问题。方庆
