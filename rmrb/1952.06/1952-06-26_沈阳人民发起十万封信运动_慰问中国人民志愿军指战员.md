Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 25th: On the eve of the "Second Anniversary of the Korean War Against America," people from all walks of life in Shenyang City launched a campaign to write 100,000 letters of慰問 (comfort/condolence) to the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In these 100,000 passionate letters of慰問, especially those written by the workers, many tell the volunteer soldiers about how their workshops or teams are responding to Chairman Gao Gang's call for increasing production and practicing economy, actively carrying out activities such as finding "竅門" (tricks), tapping potential, and learning and promoting advanced production experiences. Liu Furui, an employee of the Shenyang Train Section, said in his letter of慰問: Our railway workers, like workers all over the country, are actively participating in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Our locomotives have exceeded the original traction number (2,100 tons) by 9,000 tons and have driven safely for 500 kilometers, achieving the highest record. Students excitedly introduced to the volunteer soldiers in their letters of慰問 their own or their classmates' academic achievements in striving to improve their political awareness and scientific knowledge. Young Pioneers all included a hand-drawn picture or paper-cut flower in their letters of慰問 to the volunteer uncles and sent them to the volunteer army.机关干部 (Government cadres) wrote in their letters of慰問 about the improvement of their ideological awareness and work efficiency on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. Medical workers expressed in their letters their efforts to participate in the disease prevention and health movement. All letters of慰問 expressed a common idea: the reason why the people of the motherland can achieve great achievements in economic construction today and the people's living standards can be continuously improved is due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the heroic fighting side by side of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. They all firmly stated in their letters: they will take practical actions to actively support the Korean front and strive for the victory of the cause of resisting aggression and defending peace.
