Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 3rd: At the plenary session of the delegations of both sides in the Korean armistice talks on the 3rd, our chief representative General Nam Il pointed out that the solution to the only remaining issue of prisoners of war must comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the complete repatriation of prisoners of war after the armistice. There is absolutely no room for detaining prisoners of war under any pretext. The so-called "screening" conducted by the other party to detain prisoners of war has been completely exposed and declared thoroughly bankrupt by the just resistance of our captured personnel and the open confession of the commanders of the other party's prisoner-of-war camps, and cannot be saved by any so-called "re-screening" sophistry. Our side has made many major efforts to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue on a reasonable basis. Our compromise plan of May 2 guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can return home to live peaceful lives, fully complying with humanitarian principles and the Geneva Convention, and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. The other party insists on the illegal and unreasonable claim to detain prisoners of war and has not made any concessions. The responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with the other party. The next step in the armistice talks and the future of the entire Korean armistice depend entirely on the other party. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

    "On the only remaining issue of prisoners of war, your side has consistently adhered to the illegal and unreasonable claim of detaining prisoners of war and has never made any concessions. In the five and a half months of discussion on the prisoner-of-war issue, none of the various arguments you have put forward, from 'exchange of prisoners of war with civilians,' so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' so-called 'no forced repatriation,' to so-called 'screening' and 're-screening,' has not thoroughly violated humanitarian principles and the Geneva Convention, and none has not been for the purpose of detaining prisoners of war. People all over the world know that your side has carried out and is carrying out barbaric and bloody acts of massacre in order to carry out the conspiracy to detain prisoners of war. The heroic and just resistance of our captured personnel exposed your big lie of detaining prisoners of war. The open confession of your former prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson confirmed your big lie of detaining prisoners of war. Any so-called screening conducted to detain prisoners of war has been declared a complete bankruptcy in front of the people of the world. Your side dares not face this fact, but still attempts to use the so-called 're-screening' sophistry to save your so-called 'screening' that has been thoroughly bankrupted. The so-called 'screening' is to detain prisoners of war. Since the claim to detain prisoners of war under any name is not permitted by the Geneva Convention, and since your side's so-called 'screening' conducted to detain prisoners of war has been declared a complete bankruptcy, your side should from now on abandon the barbaric and illegal claim of detaining prisoners of war. Our side, which firmly opposes the detention of prisoners of war, cannot agree to any so-called 'screening' and will never agree to any form of so-called 're-screening.' The solution to the prisoner-of-war issue must comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the complete repatriation of prisoners of war after the armistice, and it is absolutely not allowed to conduct any so-called 'screening' or 're-screening' that violates the Geneva Convention. In order to negotiate a solution to the prisoner-of-war issue on a reasonable basis, our side has made many major concessions and put forward a reasonable compromise solution. Both sides must mutually and completely repatriate the captured personnel of the United Nations forces or the Chinese People's Volunteers and the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army or the South Korean Army who originally resided in the other side's area. The captured personnel of the Korean People's Army or the South Korean Army who originally resided in the area of the receiving party, if they are willing to return home immediately after the armistice to live a peaceful life, may not be repatriated. Our plan guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can return home to live peaceful lives. Our plan fully complies with humanitarian principles and the Geneva Convention. Our plan is an absolutely fair and reasonable compromise plan. If your side intends to achieve an armistice in Korea, your side has no reason to reject this compromise plan. Our side has resolutely and irrevocably rejected your side's unilateral and unreasonable plan of April 28 to detain prisoners of war. Our side firmly and unswervingly insists that our compromise plan of May 2 is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. Our side will forever and unchangeably oppose your side's unilateral and unreasonable plan until your side abandons this plan. In order to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue, our side has already taken more than half of the road. The next step in the armistice talks and the entire future of the armistice depend entirely on your side. The whole world knows the number of prisoners of war held by both of us. Our side is prepared to repatriate all prisoners of war so that they can return home to live peaceful lives; while your side attempts to detain a large number of our captured personnel. Our side has already put forward a completely reasonable compromise plan on the prisoner-of-war issue, but your side has never made concessions and has always insisted on the claim to detain our captured personnel. No sophistry can deny these facts."

    南日将军在三日朝鲜停战谈判会上
    再次揭穿美方扣留战俘的大骗局
    指出美方所谓“甄别”已彻底破产决非任何鬼话所能挽救【新华社开城三日电】三日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：唯一剩余的战俘问题的解决，必须遵照日内瓦公约关于停战后全部遣返战俘的规定，根本不容假借任何藉口扣留战俘，对方为扣留战俘所进行的所谓“甄别”，已为我方被俘人员的正义反抗和对方战俘营长官的公开招供所揭露无余而宣告彻底破产，决非任何所谓“再甄别”的鬼话所能挽救。我方为了在合理基础上解决战俘问题已作了多次重大努力。我方五月二日折衷的方案保证双方战俘回家过和平生活，完全符合于人道原则与日内瓦公约，是解决战俘问题唯一合理的基础。对方坚持扣留战俘的非法无理主张，未作任何让步。拖延谈判的责任完全在于对方。停战谈判的下一步和整个朝鲜停战的前途完全在于对方。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “在唯一剩余的战俘问题上，你方一贯坚持扣留战俘的非法无理主张，从未作过任何让步。在五个半月的战俘问题的讨论过程中，你方所提出的各式各样的论点从‘战俘与平民交换’、所谓‘自愿遣返’、所谓‘不得强迫遣返’到所谓‘甄别’与‘再甄别’，没有一个不是彻底违反了人道原则和日内瓦公约，没有一个不是为了扣留战俘的目的。全世界人民都知道你方为遂行扣留战俘的阴谋，已经进行了并正在进行着野蛮血腥的屠杀行为。我方被俘人员英勇正义的反抗揭穿了你方扣留战俘的大骗局。你方前任战俘营长官柯尔生公开的招供证实了你方扣留战俘的大骗局。任何为扣留战俘所进行的所谓甄别已经在世界人民面前宣布了彻底的破产。你方不敢面对这一事实，却还企图用所谓‘再甄别’的鬼话来挽救你方已经彻底破产的所谓‘甄别’。所谓‘甄别’就是为了扣留战俘，假借任何名义扣留战俘的主张既然为日内瓦公约所不许，你方为扣留战俘所进行的所谓‘甄别’既已宣告彻底破产，你方就应该从此收起扣留战俘的野蛮非法主张。坚决反对扣留战俘的我方，不可能同意任何所谓‘甄别’，也决不会同意任何形式下的所谓‘再甄别’。战俘问题的解决必须遵照日内瓦公约关于停战后全部遣返战俘的规定，而绝不容许进行任何违反日内瓦公约的所谓‘甄别’或‘再甄别’。我方为了在合理的基础上协商解决战俘问题，已经作了多次的重大让步，提出了合理的折衷解决方案。双方必须相互全部遣返联合国军或中国人民志愿军的被俘人员与朝鲜人民军或南朝鲜军原居住于对方地区内的被俘人员。原居住于收容者一方地区内的朝鲜人民军或南朝鲜军的被俘人员，如愿意在停战后立即回家过和平生活者，可以不予遣返。我方方案保证了双方被俘人员回家过和平生活。我方方案完全符合于人道原则与日内瓦公约。我方方案是绝对公平合理的折衷方案。如果你方有意于朝鲜的停战，你方就没有任何理由拒绝这一折衷方案。我方已经坚决不可挽回地拒绝了你方四月二十八日扣留战俘的片面无理方案。我方坚决不可动摇地坚持我方五月二日的折衷方案是解决战俘问题唯一合理的基础。我方将永远不可改变地反对你方片面无理方案，直到你方放弃这一方案为止。为了解决战俘问题，我方已经走了一半以上的道路。停战谈判的下一步和整个停战的前途完全在于你方。全世界都知道你我双方收容下的战俘数目。我方准备遣返全部战俘，使他们得以回家过和平生活；而你方却企图扣留大批我方被俘人员。我方在战俘问题上已经提出了完全合理的折衷方案，而你方却从未让步，始终坚持扣留我方被俘人员的主张。任何诡辩都不能否定这些事实。”
