    Suggestion to the Central People's Supervisory Committee: Investigate the Use of Technical Talents

    Editor: I fully endorse the People's Daily editorial of June 14th, "Put specialized technical talents in the posts most needed for economic construction." According to my understanding, the Central People's Supervisory Committee has nine university graduates in civil engineering, mechanical engineering, metallurgy, chemical engineering, and agriculture. Some of them have worked in highways and harbors and have some construction experience, but now they are working as clerks. Some of them have requested job transfers, but this has not been resolved yet.

    From the perspective of business development needs, the Supervisory Committee needs some experts to inspect various economic construction projects. However, there are very few experts in China right now. The few experts we have should first of all be doing design, construction, and other work. Moreover, most of these university engineering graduates in the Central Supervisory Committee cannot be used as experts yet. If they are separated from professional work, they will inevitably slowly forget the book knowledge they have learned in the past, and they will still not be able to solve technical inspection problems in the future. Therefore, this is a waste of talent. I suggest that the Central People's Supervisory Committee investigate and deal with this issue. Wu Longwen

    建议中央人民监察委员会
    检查使用技术人才的情况
    编辑同志：我完全拥护六月十四日人民日报关于“把专门技术人才放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论。据我了解，中央人民监察委员会有土木、机械、冶金、化工、农业等科的大学毕业生九人，其中有的曾在公路、港湾方面工作，有若干施工经验，现在他们却在担任文书工作。他们也曾有人要求调动工作，但到现在还没有得到解决。
    从业务发展的要求看来，监察委员会为了检查各项经济建设工作，是需要一些专家的。可是目前中国的专家很少，仅有的一些专家，首先应该去做设计、施工等工作。而且现在中央监察委员会的这些大学工科毕业生，大半也还不能当专家使用。他们现在脱离了业务工作，势必连过去所学的书本知识也要慢慢忘掉，将来还是不能解决技术上的检查问题。所以，这是一种人才的浪费。我建议中央人民监察委员会检查处理这个问题。 吴隆文
