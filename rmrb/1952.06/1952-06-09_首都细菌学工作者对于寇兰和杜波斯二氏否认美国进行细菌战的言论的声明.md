We, representing bacteriologists in Beijing, and acting from the humanitarian duty of cherishing world peace, must point out the unscientific aspects of the recent statements made in American newspapers by the two American scientists, Courland and Dubos. First, we must state that we have fully verified that American military aircraft have dropped various insects and other poisonous substances over Korea and Northeast China. Bacteriologists in various laboratories have isolated various pathogenic bacteria from these insects and other poisonous substances. If it were not for the efforts of the public health personnel and the broad masses of the people in New China, these bacteria would have caused epidemics of various diseases.

Now let us briefly describe the evidence of the scientific facts of American germ warfare. First, our entomological experts have confirmed that the large number of various insects discovered in various locations along transportation lines in Northeast China could not have naturally bred during that season. Furthermore, we have discovered various pathogenic microorganisms in the bodies of the insects, such as isolating typhoid bacilli from the bodies of houseflies; isolating many strains of paratyphoid bacilli from dung flies and black flies; isolating Shigella dysentery bacilli and paradysentery bacilli from wolf spiders and flies; isolating Pasteurella bacilli from other wolf spiders; and isolating anthrax bacilli from wolf spiders, black flies, and feathers. All of the above-mentioned bacteria have not only been identified using culture and morphology, but have also been completely identified using various bacteriological and immunological methods, and animal experiments have been conducted to confirm their powerful pathogenicity to laboratory animals and livestock. We have also fully verified in Korea that American military aircraft have repeatedly dropped rats, and plague bacilli have been isolated from the bodies of the rats. As is well known, Korea has not had plague for many years, but now plague patients have suddenly been discovered. Cholera has not occurred in Korea since 1947, but in early March of this year, two days after American military aircraft scattered flies over Pyongyang, cholera cases were suddenly discovered in the cold season below zero degrees. This is clearly artificial and scattered by American aircraft. Therefore, from the above facts, it can be summarized that the American aggressors are not satisfied with weapons that generally slaughter people, but have adopted and continue to adopt germ warfare in violation of international law and human justice.

Now, we must further point out the errors in the statements of Dr. Courland and Dr. Dubos. According to a New York dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on March 31st: Dr. Courland stated in an article he published in the New York Herald Tribune: "The bacteria of the Black Death (i.e., plague) and typhoid fever die very quickly once exposed to bright sunlight and cold air." Dr. Courland wrote: "They cannot survive below freezing temperatures. For this reason, it is impossible to spread them in winter."

However, every bacteriologist knows that cold is the best way to preserve most bacteria; moreover, Dubos's book "Bacterial and Mycotic Infections of Man," pages 381 and 491, clearly states that these bacteria can withstand cold and can even survive in a frozen state for many days. In the chapter on plague in that book, it is specifically pointed out that "they can live up to ten years" (page 419). While direct sunlight is harmful to bacteria, Courland deliberately fails to mention that American military aircraft use nighttime and cloudy days to spread bacteria; he also deliberately fails to mention that the various bacterial weapons used by the American aggressors include the use of many specially cultured cold-resistant insects and other animals, even rats, as tools for carrying these germs. We know very well that sunlight cannot easily affect bacteria attached to or inside the bodies of insects and rats. Thus, Courland's main argument for denying involvement in germ warfare is completely untenable.

In a conversation published in the New York Times on April 3rd, Dr. Courland commented on the photos published in the Beijing People's Daily on March 15th, saying: "After careful study of these photos, it is very clear that none of the insects in the pictures can carry germs." In the same day's New York Times, Dr. Dubos, a well-known infectious disease specialist, also defended those criminals who were conducting germ warfare against the people of Korea and China. He asserted and maliciously concluded: "This is almost a completely amateurish attempt to create scientific forgeries. None of the names of these bacteria are correct. None of these bacteria can be carried by insects." But any bacteriologist knows that insects spread bacteria in different ways. One way is that blood-sucking insects suck bacteria into their bodies, reproduce, and then spread them to humans. Another way is that insects can mechanically carry and spread bacteria, especially those pathogens that infect the human and animal gastrointestinal tracts and directly transmitted diseases. In such cases, there is absolutely no reason to deny that flies can carry anthrax bacilli, typhoid bacilli, or dysentery bacilli, or that wolf spider can carry Pasteurella bacilli. It is regrettable that Dr. Courland and Dr. Dubos, who have achieved success in science, blindly defend the war criminals who are conducting germ warfare with inhumane cruelty, which even American air force prisoners of war have confessed to.

Everyone with a human conscience knows that modern science is the crystallization of human labor, and science should benefit mankind. As for modern medicine, it has arisen specifically to protect humanity from disease and suffering. Therefore, all scientists with a human conscience cannot help but express immense hatred for those aggressors who steal the fruits of scientific research and turn science into a tool for mass murder. We are Chinese bacteriologists, and after personally participating in on-site investigations and inspections of the American aggressors' germ warfare, and personally verifying the crimes of the American aggressors, we cannot restrain our righteous anger. We denounce those scum of the scientific community who work in bacterial killing factories and sell out science and human conscience.

We believe that the various evidentiary materials published by the Korean and Chinese sides to date are sufficient to fully prove the fact that the American aggressors are conducting germ warfare. We hope that honest scientists around the world, including honest scientists in the United States, will face up to the threat and disgrace that the American aggressors' germ warfare poses to human civilization and the honor of science, and face up to the solemn responsibility we should bear for safeguarding human justice and scientific honor, so as to actively take action and take effective measures to stop the continuation of germ warfare.

### 首都细菌学工作者对于寇兰和杜波斯二氏否认美国进行细菌战的言论的声明

    首都细菌学工作者对于寇兰和杜波斯二氏否认美国进行细菌战的言论的声明
    我们代表北京细菌学工作者，本着爱护人类和平的天职，要指出寇兰和杜波斯这两位美国科学家最近在美国报纸上发表的言论不合科学的地方。首先，我们要说明，我们已经完全证实了美国军用机在朝鲜和我国东北境内投下了许多种虫子及其他毒物。各地细菌学家在各不同化验室中，已经由这些虫子及其他毒物分离出了各种致病的细菌。假如没有经过新中国卫生人员和广大人民群众的努力，这些细菌就能引起各种不同疫病的流行。
    现在让我们简略叙述一下美国进行细菌战的科学事实的证据。首先，我们的昆虫学专家已经证实，在我国东北沿交通线各地所发现的大量的各种虫子，不可能是各该地的季节中自然滋生的。再进一步，我们又已经从虫子体中发现了各种致病微生物，例如从大家蝇体中分离出了伤寒杆菌；从粪蝇，黑蝇中分离出了许多株副伤寒杆菌；从狼蛛和蝇子中分离出了志贺氏痢疾杆菌和副痢疾杆菌；又从另一些狼蛛体中分离出了巴氏杆菌；又从狼蛛、黑蝇和羽毛分离出了炭疽杆菌。所有上列各种病菌，不但是曾用培养和形态来鉴定，而且是用各种细菌学和免疫学方法所完全鉴定，并作了动物实验，证实它们对化验室动物和家畜有强大致病力。我们在朝鲜也完全证实，美国军用机曾屡次投下老鼠，而从鼠体中分离出了鼠疫杆菌。如所周知，朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫，而现在突然发现了鼠疫患者。从一九四七年以来，朝鲜就未曾发生过霍乱，但本年三月初，美国军用机在平壤散布蝇子后两天内，在零度下的寒冷季节突然发现了霍乱病例。这显然是人为的，是美机所撒布的。所以，从上述事实可以总结说明美国侵略者不满足于一般屠杀人民的武器，而且已经采用并且继续采用着违反国际公法和人类正义的细菌战。
    现在，我们要进一步指出寇兰博士和杜波斯博士的言论的错误。据美国新闻处纽约三月三十一日电：寇兰博士在他发表在纽约先驱论坛报的一篇文章中竟说：“黑死病（即鼠疫）和伤寒的细菌一经暴露在明亮的阳光下和寒冷的空气中就会很快地死去。”寇兰博士写道：“它们不能在冰点以下的温度下生存。由于这个原因，所以不可能在冬季散播它们。”
    但是每个细菌工作者都知道，寒冷是保存大多数细菌的最良好的办法；而且杜波斯氏所著“人类的细菌和真菌感染”一书中第三百八十一页和四百九十一页中也清楚地说明了这些细菌能抵抗寒冷，甚至在冰冻状态中能活存许多天。在该书鼠疫一章中，更具体地指出“可以活到十年”（四百一十九页）。阳光的直射固然对细菌有害，但是寇兰故意不提及美国军用机利用夜间及阴天来撒布细菌；他也故意不提美国侵略者所采用的各种细菌武器是包括利用许多经过特别培养耐寒的昆虫及其他动物甚至老鼠来做携带这些病菌的工具。我们很清楚地知道，阳光对附带于昆虫和老鼠体内外的病菌是不能或不易起作用的。这样，寇兰所持为否认从事细菌战的主要论点就完全站不住了。
    寇兰博士在他发表在纽约时报四月三日的谈话中，对北京人民日报三月十五日所刊载的照片评论说：“对于这些照片经过仔细的研究后，可以十分明显地看出：图上的昆虫，没有一种是能够带病菌的。”在同日纽约时报中，另有著名的传染病学家杜波斯博士也为那些向朝中两国人民进行细菌战的罪犯们作辩护。他武断地并且恶毒地下结论说：“在制造科学的赝品上，这几乎是一个完全外行人的尝试。这些细菌的名称没有一个是说对了的。这些细菌没有一种可以被昆虫携带。”但是任何细菌工作者都知道昆虫传播细菌有不同的方式。一种方式是吮血的昆虫将细菌吸入体内，经过繁殖而再传播于人。另一种方式是昆虫可以机械地带上细菌而撒布的，特别是传染那些侵袭人类和动物肠胃道及直接接触传染的疾病病原菌。在这样情形下，没有任何理由可以否认蝇子可以携带炭疽杆菌、伤寒杆菌或痢疾杆菌，或狼蛛可以携带巴氏杆菌。我们很可惜在科学上有过成就的寇兰博士和杜波斯博士竟也盲目地替那些连美国空军俘虏都已供认的灭绝人性地进行细菌战的战犯们作诡辩。
    一切有人类良知的人都知道：现代科学是人类劳动的结晶，科学应该是造福于人类的。至于现代医学，那就更是为着保护人类免于疾病和痛苦而兴起的。因此，一切具有人类良知的科学家，对于那些盗窃科学研究的成果，把科学变为大规模杀人的工具的侵略者，没有不表示无比的仇恨的。我们是中国的细菌工作者，我们在亲自参加了对美国侵略者的细菌战的实地调查和检验工作，并亲自证实了美国侵略者这种罪行之后，我们抑制不住我们自己的正义的愤怒。我们斥责那些在细菌杀人工厂工作、出卖了科学和人类良知的科学界的败类。
    我们认为：迄今为止朝中方面已经公布的各种证明材料，已经足以充分证明美国侵略者进行细菌战的事实。我们希望全世界正直的科学家，包括美国的正直的科学家在内，正视美国侵略者进行细菌战给人类文明和科学的荣誉所带来的威胁和污辱，正视我们自己所应该负担的维护人类正义和科学荣誉的庄严责任，从而积极行动起来，采取有效的办法来制止细菌战的继续进行。签名：
