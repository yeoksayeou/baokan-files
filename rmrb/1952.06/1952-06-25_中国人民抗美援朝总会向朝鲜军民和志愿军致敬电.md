    Message of Respect from the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to the Korean People and Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Message of Respect to the Korean People and Army
    To General Kim Il-sung and forwarded to the Korean People and the Korean People's Army:
    For two years, under your leadership, the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army have achieved glorious victories in the war against the American aggressors. These victories have defended your country's freedom and independence, and encouraged and strengthened the world's people's victorious confidence in resisting aggression and defending peace. The people of the world are supporting your just struggle and rejoicing in your victory.
    For two years, the anti-aggression struggle waged shoulder to shoulder by the people's armed forces of our two countries, China and Korea, has further consolidated and developed the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and this consolidated friendship and unity is the fundamental factor in defeating the aggressors.
    Although the American aggressors have suffered defeats, they have not restrained their aggressive ambitions. They are delaying the armistice negotiations, massively massacring our captured personnel, and conducting inhumane germ warfare. But these barbaric crimes will not only fail to save them from defeat, but will also arouse greater anger from the Chinese and Korean people and be justly condemned by the people of the world.
    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against America, we, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, extend our highest respect to you and the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. We, the Chinese people, will resolutely stand with the Korean people and continue to fight for the victorious end of the anti-aggression war and the fair and reasonable settlement of the Korean issue.
    The glory of the heroic nation will forever belong to you!
    The Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    Message of Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers
    To Commander Peng Dehuai and forwarded to all commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
    The Korean War has been going on for two years. The glorious achievements made by the people's armed forces of China and Korea on the Korean battlefield are inseparable from your names. This glorious victory has defended the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, consolidated the security of the motherland, defended peace in Asia, and enhanced the world's people's victorious confidence in resisting aggression and defending peace.
    You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, you are our "most beloved people," and your every victory immediately arouses encouragement and joy among our compatriots across the country. On this second anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance against Aggression, we, on behalf of all our compatriots, extend our highest respects to you!
    It has been almost a year since the American aggressors were forced to accept armistice negotiations, and the facts of the past year have shown that the American government has no sincerity in resolving the Korean issue peacefully. It has not only used all despicable and shameless means to delay the negotiations, but has also carried out large-scale germ warfare in an attempt to massively destroy peaceful residents of Korea and China. But in the face of the powerful strength of the Chinese and Korean people, in the face of your heroic struggle, the enemy's heinous crimes only prove that they are making a dying struggle.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, after the victorious conclusion of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the entire Chinese people are actively engaged in the movement to increase production and practice economy, and continue to strengthen their support for you. We wish you continued success in striving for greater victories, so that peace in Asia and world peace can be further guaranteed.
    The glory of patriots will forever belong to you!
    The Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea

    中国人民抗美援朝总会向朝鲜军民和志愿军致敬电
    向朝鲜军民致敬电金日成将军并转朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军：
    两年来，在您领导下的英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，在反抗美国侵略者的战争中，获得了辉煌的胜利。这种胜利捍卫了贵国的自由与独立，鼓舞与加强了全世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的胜利信心。全世界人民在支持着你们的正义斗争，为你们的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    两年来我们中朝两国人民武装并肩进行的反侵略斗争，又进一步巩固和发展了中朝人民的兄弟友谊，而这种巩固的友谊团结，乃是战胜侵略者的基本因素。
    美国侵略者虽然遭受失败，但并未收敛它的侵略野心。它正在拖延停战谈判，大规模地虐杀我方被俘人员，并且进行违反人道的细菌战。但这些野蛮的罪行非但不能挽救它的败局，反而引起了中朝人民更大的愤怒，受到全世界人民正义的谴责。
    在这朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年之际，我们代表全中国人民特向您和朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军致以崇高的敬意。我们中国人民将坚决地和朝鲜人民站在一起，继续奋斗，以争取反侵略战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的公平合理解决。
    英雄民族的光荣永远属于你们！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    一九五二年六月二十四日
    向中国人民志愿军致敬电彭德怀司令员并转中国人民志愿军全体指战员同志：
    朝鲜战争已两周年了。中朝两国人民武装在朝鲜战场上所获得的光辉战绩，是与你们的名字分不开的。这一光辉的胜利捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，巩固了祖国的安全，保卫了亚洲的和平，增强了全世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的胜利信心。
    你们是中国人民的优秀儿女，你们是我们“最可爱的人”，你们的每一胜利，都立刻引起全国同胞们的鼓舞与欢欣。在这朝鲜反抗侵略战争的两周年，我们谨代表全国同胞，向你们致崇高的敬礼！
    美国侵略者被迫接受停战谈判以来转瞬也快一年了，一年来的事实表明了美国政府毫无和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。它不仅用尽一切卑鄙无耻的手段来拖延谈判，并且大规模进行细菌战，企图大量毁灭朝中和平居民。但在强大的中朝人民力量面前，在你们的英勇斗争面前，敌人的万恶罪行，只不过证明他自己是在作垂死的挣扎而已。
    我们全中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，经过“三反”、“五反”运动的胜利结束之后，正积极从事增产节约运动，并继续加强对你们的支援。祝你们再接再厉，争取更伟大的胜利，使亚洲和平与世界和平获得进一步的保障。
    爱国主义者的光荣永远属于你们！
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    一九五二年六月二十四日
