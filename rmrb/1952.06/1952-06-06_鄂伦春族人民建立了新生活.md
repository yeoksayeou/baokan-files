    Letter from a Reader:

    The Oroqen People Have Established a New Life
    Editor: I am writing this letter to you with excitement.

    Before liberation, reactionary rulers and Japanese imperialism sowed discord among the Oroqen people, dividing them into many factions. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Oroqen people established their own national people's government, and everyone united.

    The Oroqen people are actively engaged in production. From last November to this March, according to statistics from the local cooperative alone, the whole banner hunted a total of 38 deer and elk, 9,478 gray rats, 32 lynx, 11 wolves, and 137 badgers. As income has increased, the lives of the Oroqen people have improved.

    Preventing forest fires and protecting forests is a particularly important task in the Oroqen people's settlements. Under the leadership and education of the People's Government, the Oroqen people have recognized the importance of preventing forest fires and protecting forests, and have regarded participating in fire prevention and forest protection work as one of the practical actions to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. As long as the work of preventing forest fires and protecting forests is done well, increased production and thrift here will be guaranteed.

    In the past, when the Oroqen people got sick, there was no one to treat them and no medicine to take. After liberation, the People's Government vaccinated them, treated diseases, and promoted maternal and infant health, thereby reducing the population mortality rate. Now a medical team has been formed in the banner, and a primary school has also been established. Seventy-five percent of school-age children have entered school. Some have even gone to middle school in other places.

    The Oroqen people know that these good times are given by Chairman Mao. The Oroqen people are actively increasing production to repay Chairman Mao's concern and strive for a better tomorrow.

    鄂伦春族人民建立了新生活
    编辑同志：我以兴奋的心情来向你们写这封信。
    解放以前，反动统治者和日本帝国主义在鄂伦春族人民中间进行挑拨离间，把鄂伦春族弄得四分五裂。解放以后，鄂伦春族人民在共产党、人民政府的领导下，建立了本民族的人民政府，大家团结起来了。
    鄂伦春族人民正在积极生产。从去年十一月到今年三月，仅据当地合作社统计，全旗共猎获鹿和犴三十八只、灰鼠九千四百七十八只、猞猁三十二只、狼十一只、艾虎子一百三十七只。由于收入增多，鄂伦春族人民的生活改善了。
    防火护林，在鄂伦春族人民的住地，是一个特别重要的任务。在人民政府领导和教育下，鄂伦春族人民认识了防火护林的重要性，把参加防火护林工作，作为支援中国人民志愿军的实际行动之一。只要防火护林的工作做好了，这里的增产节约就有保障了。
    过去，鄂伦春族的人民生病，没有人治，没有药吃。解放以后，人民政府给他们种牛痘、治疗疾病，宣传妇婴卫生，因而减低了人口的死亡率。现在旗里已经组成了医疗队，还成立了一所小学。百分之七十五的学龄儿童，都进了学校。有的还到外地进了中学。
    鄂伦春族人民知道：这些好光景是毛主席给的。鄂伦春族人民正在积极增加生产，报答毛主席的关怀，争取更美好的明天。　思光
