Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 6th. The American aggressors, sparing no despicable means to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, indiscriminately shelled the Panmunjom conference area and its periphery with intense artillery fire on the morning of the 5th. Three children were wounded within the conference area. Including the outer edge of the conference area, a total of four peaceful residents were killed and ten were wounded (one has since died of their wounds), the majority of whom were women and children.

This serious provocative act by the U.S. side, in violation of the agreement, is clearly aimed at directly undermining the security of the conference area, pushing the negotiations, which have already reached an unprecedented deadlock due to the U.S. side's insistence on unreasonable demands, towards rupture, in order to realize their intention of terminating the negotiations, which they dare not openly declare within the conference.

At noon that day, security officers from our side and the U.S. side in the Panmunjom conference area went to the scene for a joint investigation. The American officers personally saw the two wounded children in the conference area (one had already been sent to the hospital) and saw the shrapnel all over the ground. At the same time, two villagers provided eyewitness evidence. The U.S. officers had to admit that the shells came from their positions and that they did indeed violate the agreement by hitting the conference area.

At 8:40 a.m. on the 5th, many residents of Guanyindong, on the northern edge of the Panmunjom conference area, were working in the wheat fields when suddenly a barrage of intense artillery fire came from the U.S. positions in the southeast, followed by another barrage about three minutes later. Dozens of shells, all air-burst fragmentation shells, exploded at low altitude. For a time, thick smoke filled the air, and the scattered fragments caused heavy civilian casualties. At about 11:00 a.m., reporters rushed to the scene to investigate. The sound of women and children wailing filled Guanyindong. Strong young men, their eyes burning with anger, were silently using stretchers and ox carts to send their injured relatives and neighbors to Kaesong for treatment. Medical personnel from the Chinese and Korean forces were bandaging the wounded. In the wheat fields inside and outside the boundary marker of the conference area, many shell fragments were scattered. A Korean old woman living in the conference area had her daughter-in-law and a two-year-old grandson killed. Another one-year-old grandson was injured in the head and cheeks, and the blood on his calf soaked through the bandages. The old woman grabbed the Chinese and Korean personnel who went to the scene to investigate, weeping and recounting the atrocities of the U.S. side, demanding that they avenge her.

And at this very moment, in the conference tent hundreds of meters away, the American representative Harrison was still peddling America's "humanitarian principles"!

The area hit by the American shells was only a few hundred meters away from the road where the Korean and Chinese representatives traveled to Panmunjom for the meeting, and from the meeting tent. The U.S. side's deliberate attempt to sabotage the negotiations by undermining the security of the conference area is obvious, and its serious responsibility is also inescapable.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 6th. At 8:40 a.m. on the 5th, the other side once again seriously violated the agreement and shelled the Panmunjom conference area, wounding three young children in the conference area. An on-site investigation was conducted on the same day by security officers from both sides in the conference area, and the other side's security officers directly admitted it. Our liaison officer was ordered on June 6th to lodge a protest with the other side. The full text of the protest is as follows:

"To Colonel Kennie, Chief Liaison Officer of the United Nations Command Delegation:

At 8:40 a.m. on June 5th, your ground forces shelled the Panmunjom conference area for half an hour, wounding an eleven-year-old girl, a twelve-year-old girl, and an infant under the age of three in the southwest of the village. At 11:40 a.m. on June 5th, after a joint investigation by the security officers of both sides, the evidence of your violation of the agreement is conclusive and unquestionable. Your security officers admitted on the spot that this incident was caused by your ground forces. In response, I am ordered to protest to you and point out that the incident on June 5th is another serious provocative act by your side, disregarding our repeated protests and warnings. This provocative act directly threatens the foundation for the continuation of negotiations. We demand that your side immediately cease all provocative acts that undermine the negotiations, and immediately make a conscientious and responsible handling of this provocative incident. We await your reply.

Colonel Zhang Chunshan
Chief Liaison Officer of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation
June 6, 1952."

    美军竟炮轰板门店中立区打死打伤居民十四人
    我方首席联络官奉命向美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城六日电】不惜以一切卑鄙手段破坏朝鲜停战谈判的美国侵略者，五日晨竟以密集炮火向板门店会场区及其边缘轰击。在会场区内打伤儿童三名。连同会场区外缘，共打死和平居民四人，打伤十人（一人已伤重不治），其中大半是妇女、儿童。
    美方这一违反协议的严重挑衅行为，目的显系以直接破坏会场区的安全，把已因美方坚持无理要求而陷于空前僵局的谈判推向破裂，来实现他们在会内不敢公开宣布的终止谈判的企图。
    当天中午，板门店会场区我方安全军官与美方安全军官前往现场共同调查。美国军官亲眼看见在会场区内受伤的儿童两名（一人已送医院），看到满地弹片。同时，两个村民提出了目睹的证据。美方军官不得不承认炮弹是他们阵地打来的，而且确系违反协议打到会场区内。
    五日晨八时四十分，板门店会场区北缘观音洞的居民多人正在麦地里耕作，突然自东南方的美方阵地内发来密集炮火一排，约三分钟后又发来一排。炮弹数十枚，全系在低空爆炸的杀伤弹。一时浓烟弥漫，四散的碎片造成惨重的平民伤亡。十一时许，记者驰赴现场调查。观音洞一片妇女小孩嚎哭之声。眼中烧着怒火，沉默不言的壮年男子，正用担架及牛车把受伤的亲属邻人送往开城救治。中朝部队的医护人员正为伤者包扎。在会场区界牌内外的麦地里，散着许多炮弹碎片。住在会场区内的一位朝鲜老太太，她的儿媳及一个两岁的孙子被打死了。另外一个一岁的乳孙头部及腮部受伤，小腿上的鲜血浸透了包扎的纱布。老太太拉住前往现场察看的朝中人员，哭诉美方暴行，要求替她报仇。
    而就在这个时候，几百公尺外的会议帐篷内，美国代表哈利逊还在贩卖美国的“人道原则”！
    美国炮弹击中的地区，距朝中代表前往板门店开会的公路，距开会的帐篷，都只有几百公尺。美方蓄意以破坏会场区安全而破坏谈判的企图，昭然若揭，其严重责任，也无可逃避。
    【新华社开城六日电】五日上午八时四十分，对方又一次严重破坏协议，向板门店会场区炮击，击伤会场区内幼童三人。当日由双方会场区内双方安全军官进行实地调查，对方安全军官直认不讳。我方联络官在六月六日奉命向对方提出抗议，抗议全文如下：
    “联合国军代表团首席联络官肯尼上校：
    六月五日上午八时四十分，你方地面部队向板门店会场区炮击达半小时之久，在店村西南会场区内击伤十一岁、十二岁女孩各一名，和不满三岁的婴孩一名。六月五日十一时四十分，经过双方安全军官的共同调查，你方破坏协议的行为，证据确凿，无可置疑。你方安全军官当场承认此次事件为你方地面部队所为。对此，我奉命向你方抗议，并提出六月五日的事件，是你方不顾我方屡次抗议和警告，又一次的严重挑衅行为。这一挑衅行为直接威胁着谈判继续进行的基础。我方要求你方立即停止一切破坏谈判的挑衅行为，对此次挑衅事件立即作认真负责的处理。我方等待你方的答复。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团首席联络官
        张春山上校    　一九五二年六月六日。”
