Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 14th. The Lee Seung-man puppet regime is currently staging an internal farce of power struggles and mutual recrimination. Lee Seung-man declared martial law in Busan and other areas on the midnight of May 24th, arrested a large number of opposition puppet national assembly members, and threatened to dissolve the puppet national assembly where anti-Lee members held a majority. The utterly corrupt and completely unpopular Lee Seung-man puppet regime has become a smoky and chaotic mess internally.

Lee Seung-man launched this "quasi-military coup" (Associated Press) on the eve of the puppet presidential election. As an Associated Press dispatch from Busan on May 28th stated: "The current National Assembly probably will not re-elect Lee Seung-man, nor will it allow him to designate his successor." Therefore, Lee Seung-man "attempts to maintain governmental control through threats, terror, and coercion." Before initiating the arrests, Lee Seung-man instigated his henchmen to attack the puppet National Assembly, demanding the "removal of assembly members from the anti-Lee Seung-man faction." At midnight on May 24th, Lee Seung-man declared martial law in Busan and other areas, ordering military police to arrest puppet assembly members. He appointed the notorious secret agent Lee Bum-suk as Minister of Home Affairs to control the puppet police and, disregarding the puppet National Assembly's resolutions demanding the revocation of martial law and the release of the arrested puppet assembly members, continued the arrests. As of May 31st, twelve anti-Lee faction puppet assembly members had been arrested, many assembly members had been detained by the Military Police Headquarters, and some assembly members "dared not go home because military police were patrolling near their residences." Following this incident, Lee Seung-man and the opposition factions launched extensive attacks against each other. The anti-Lee faction attacked Lee Seung-man as a "muddled dictator" and his government as a "bureaucratic, dictatorial, and corrupt government"; Lee Seung-man attacked the anti-Lee faction assembly members for "accepting bribes" and threatened to dissolve the puppet National Assembly.

The ugly farce staged by the Lee Seung-man gang fully exposed the ugly essence of the Lee Seung-man puppet regime fostered by the US aggressors, causing the US aggressors great annoyance. As an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 3rd stated: "President Lee Seung-man's activities and his order to arrest people have made a mess of the reputation of a government that is supported by sixteen countries and for which they are fighting on the Korean Peninsula." But what makes the US aggressors most uneasy is that this farce also exposed that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" that the US aggressors stubbornly insist on is completely a deception, because clearly no truly patriotic Korean people would support such a corrupt and dark bandit group. Therefore, the US aggressors are frantically applying pressure on Lee Seung-man and conducting negotiations, trying their best to calm down this farce.

    美国一手扶植的李承晚匪帮演出内哄丑剧
    【新华社平壤十四日电】李承晚伪政权内部正演出一幕争权夺利、互相倾轧的内哄丑剧。李承晚于五月二十四日午夜宣布在釜山等地实行戒严，大批逮捕反对派的伪国会议员，并扬言准备解散反李议员占优势的伪国会。腐烂透顶、完全不得人心的李承晚伪政权内部已闹得乌烟瘴气，一片混乱。
    李承晚发动这一次“准军事性的政变”（美联社），正在伪总统选举前夕。如美联社釜山五月二十八日电所称：“本届国会大概不会重选李承晚，也不会让他指定他的继任人。”因此，李承晚“企图以威胁、恐怖与强制手段来维持政府的控制权”。在发动逮捕以前，李承晚即指使他的爪牙，袭击伪国会，要求“罢免反对李承晚派的议员”。五月二十四日午夜，李承晚宣布在釜山等地实行戒严，命令宪兵逮捕伪议员。他任命恶名昭彰的特务李范奭为内务部长官，以控制伪警察，并不顾伪国会要求取消戒严令、释放被捕的伪议员的决议，继续进行逮捕。到五月三十一日为止，已有十二名反李派的伪议员被捕，许多议员曾被宪兵司令部拘留，还有若干议员因为“宪兵在住宅旁边走动，不敢回家”。在此事件发生之后，李承晚与反对派之间互相大肆攻击。反李派攻击李承晚为“糊涂独裁者”，攻击李承晚政府为“官僚主义、独裁和腐化的政府”；李承晚就攻击反李派的议员“收受贿赂”，并扬言准备解散伪国会。
    李承晚匪帮演出的这一丑剧，完全暴露了美国侵略者一手扶助的李承晚伪政权的丑恶本质，因而使得美国侵略者感到了很大的烦恼。正如法新社华盛顿三日电所称：“李承晚总统的活动和他下令捕人的行为，使一个政府的声誉弄得一团糟，而十六个国家所支持的、并且正在朝鲜本土上为之进行战斗的就是这个政府。”但是最使美国侵略者不安的是这一丑剧，也暴露了美国侵略者所蛮横坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”“甄别”完全是一个骗局，因为显然没有一个真正爱国的朝鲜人民会支持这样一个腐败、黑暗的匪徒集团。因此，美国侵略者正在慌忙对李承晚施用压力，并进行折冲，竭力要把这一丑剧平息下来。
