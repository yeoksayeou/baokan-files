Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: British Defense Minister Alexander and Deputy Foreign Minister Lloyd, sent by the British government to Korea for "inspection," returned to Britain from Washington on the 25th. As expected, their trip not only failed to achieve the British ruling group's demand for "greater say" in the Korean armistice negotiations and "participation in more senior decisions of the United Nations Command in Korea," but also, under the high pressure of their American masters, they are continuing to slavishly follow the US policy of delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations.

Alexander and Lloyd arrived in Japan on the 10th. On the 9th, while passing through Hong Kong, Alexander tentatively sought the opinion of the US side, saying that if Clark proposed sending a British representative to the armistice negotiations, "he would gladly agree." The US immediately gave a blunt refusal to this British request to intervene in the Korean armistice negotiations. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 11th: "US officials confirmed that the United States is currently firmly opposed to expanding the membership of the United Nations armistice negotiation delegation and does not support Britain sending a representative to participate." Under this domineering pressure from the US, Alexander quickly changed his tune. On the 15th, when he hosted a press conference in Seoul, he said that he "did not think it was a good idea to add a British representative to the United Nations delegation," and disgustingly boasted that cooperation between Britain and the United States was "top-notch."

On the 18th, Alexander and Lloyd ended their activities in Japan and Korea and went to Canada. On the same day, the "New York Times," reflecting the opinions of the US ruling group, published an editorial on this guest who had not yet arrived in the United States, saying that Alexander's report on his trip to the Far East "should be sufficient to consolidate the unity of the United Nations and sufficient to ease the doubts or impolite criticisms expressed by Britain and the United States regarding the conduct of the Korean War and armistice negotiations." Under this strong hint from the US ruling group, Alexander further fawned on the US in Ottawa on the 19th, saying: "Suggesting sending a British representative to participate in the negotiations is not a good idea, because such action may make the Chinese and Korean sides think that there are differences of opinion between the United States and Britain." British "authoritative sources" also said on the same day: "Britain has abandoned its plan to participate in the Panmunjom armistice negotiations and will not request adding a British representative to the United Nations Command delegation. At the same time, Britain is no longer considering demanding that Britain participate more in the high-level consultations of the United Nations Command in Korea." (United Press International, London, 19th)

Alexander's flattering attitude won the favor of his American masters, "putting the American newspapers at ease" (United States Information Service, Washington, 20th). On the 22nd, Alexander and his party arrived in Washington and then held a series of meetings with the US Department of Defense and visited Truman. According to Reuters, US "diplomatic and military planners" decided to "persuade" Alexander not to insist on sending a British representative to participate in the armistice negotiations. In order to give Britain a little favor and try to ease the dissatisfaction of the British people, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, the US Department of Defense has agreed to Alexander's proposal to send a British liaison officer to Clark's headquarters.

On the 23rd, the US aggressors carried out new provocative actions in Korea. The US Air Force indiscriminately bombed the peaceful industry in the rear of Korea—the Supung Dam on the Yalu River. This action aroused widespread anger and opposition from the British people, and the British House of Commons had to conduct an emergency debate on this. But facts have proved that Alexander and the British government are accomplices in this new provocation by the US aggressors. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London on the 23rd: "The news of the United Nations Air Force bombing the North Korean hydroelectric power station on the Yalu River did not cause surprise among officials here." These officials also said that Alexander, who was in Washington at the time, "personally knew about the proposed bombing plan," and "perhaps" he also "approved of the plan." Alexander also said in Washington on the 24th that he "had no objection to this attack" (Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th). He also praised "the Americans did a very good job" (United Press International, United Nations Headquarters, New York, 24th).

It is quite obvious that Alexander's trip to the Far East not only cannot deceive the British people and ease the dissatisfaction of the British people with the delay in the Korean armistice negotiations, but also further exposes his face as a Wall Street errand boy in front of the British people and the people of the world, proving that the British government is a shameful accomplice of the United States in deliberately delaying and even undermining the Korean armistice negotiations.

### 亚历山大参与美国在朝鲜新的挑衅行动  证明英国是美国拖延停战谈判的同谋犯

    亚历山大参与美国在朝鲜新的挑衅行动  证明英国是美国拖延停战谈判的同谋犯
    【新华社二十七日讯】被英国政府派去朝鲜进行“视察”的英国国防大臣亚历山大和外交副大臣劳埃德，已经在二十五日从华盛顿返抵英国。如所预料，他们此行不但没有达到英国统治集团要求在朝鲜停战谈判中“有比较大的发言权”，并“参与朝鲜联合国军司令部的比较高级的决定”的目的，而且正在美国主人的高压下，继续奴颜婢膝地追随美国的拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的政策。
    亚历山大和劳埃德是在十日抵达日本的。在九日路过香港时，亚历山大曾经试探美国方面的意见说：如果克拉克提出派遣一位英国代表参加停战谈判，“他将欣然同意”。对于英国这种希望在朝鲜停战谈判中插一手的要求，美国马上就给予干脆的拒绝。据合众社华盛顿十一日电称：“美国官方人士证实，美国目前坚决反对扩大联合国停战谈判代表团的成员国，不赞成英国派代表参加。”在美国这种专横的压力之下，亚历山大连忙改变腔调。十五日他在汉城招待记者时就说，他“不认为让联合国代表团添一个英国代表是一个好办法”，并且令人作呕地吹嘘英美之间的合作是“顶呱呱的”。
    十八日，亚历山大和劳埃德结束了在日本和朝鲜的活动，前往加拿大。就在这一天，反映美国统治集团意见的“纽约时报”对这位还没有到美国的客人发表社论说：亚历山大关于他这次远东之行的报告“应该足以巩固联合国的团结，并且足以缓和英美两国对于朝鲜战争与停战谈判进行情形所表示的怀疑或者不客气的抨击”。在美国统治集团这种强烈暗示之下，亚历山大十九日在渥太华进一步逢迎美国说：“建议派遣一个英国代表参加谈判，不是一个好主意，因为这种行动可能使中朝方面认为美国和英国之间有了分歧的意见。”英国方面的“权威人士”也在同一天说：“英国已放弃参加板门店停战谈判的计划，将不要求在联合国军代表团添一名英国代表了。同时，英国也不再考虑要求让英国更多地参与朝鲜联合国军司令部的高级会商。”（合众社伦敦十九日电）
    亚历山大这种曲意奉承的态度，博得了美国主人的欢心，“使美国的报纸都安心了”（美国新闻处华盛顿二十日电）。二十二日，亚历山大等一行抵达华盛顿，接着与美国国防部举行了一连串会议，并访问了杜鲁门。据路透社透露，美国的“外交和军事策划人”决定“劝”亚历山大不要坚持派英国代表参加停战谈判。为了给予英国以一点小恩小惠，并企图缓和英国人民的不满情绪，据法新社华盛顿二十三日电透露，美国国防部已同意亚历山大提出的派一个英国联络官驻在克拉克总部的建议。
    二十三日，美国侵略者又在朝鲜进行了新的挑衅行动。美国空军滥炸朝鲜后方的和平工业——鸭绿江上的水丰发电站。这一行动引起了英国人民普遍的愤怒和反对，英国下议院为此不得不进行了紧急辩论。但事实证明，亚历山大和英国政府是参与美国侵略者这一新挑衅行为的同谋犯。据法新社伦敦二十三日电透露：“联合国空军轰炸鸭绿江上的北朝鲜水力发电站的消息，并没有在此间官方人士中引起惊异。”这些官方人士还说，当时正在华盛顿的亚历山大“是亲自知道拟议中的轰炸计划的”，而且“也许”他还“赞同这个计划”。亚历山大二十四日在华盛顿也说，他“毫不反对这一次袭击”
    （法新社华盛顿二十四日电）他并且称赞“美国人做得非常出色”（合众社纽约联合国总部二十四日电）。
    十分显然，亚历山大的远东之行不但不能欺骗英国人民、缓和英国人民对于朝鲜停战谈判拖延不决的不满情绪，反而进一步在英国人民和全世界人民面前暴露了自己的华尔街小伙计的面目，证明了英国政府是故意拖延以至破坏朝鲜停战谈判的美国的可耻的同谋者。
