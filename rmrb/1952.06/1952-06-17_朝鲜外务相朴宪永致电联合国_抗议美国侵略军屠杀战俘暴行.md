Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 16th: Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Park Hon Yong sent a cable to the United Nations Secretariat on the 15th, solemnly protesting the bloody slaughter of captured Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel by American aggressor troops; and notified the United Nations Secretariat of the statement issued on the 12th of this month by the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, denouncing and protesting the atrocities of the American imperialists. The text of Park Hon Yong's protest telegram is as follows:

Lake Success, New York, United Nations Secretariat:

I am now notifying the member states of the United Nations of the statement of the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front protesting the slaughter of captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies by American interventionists. The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic is entirely consistent with the position of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, which represents the common will of all patriotic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea.

It is particularly noteworthy that even the representatives of the US military headquarters, former commander of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, Dodd, and Colson, had to admit that the atrocities committed by the US occupation authorities against prisoners of war flagrantly violated the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and other international agreements. This most heinous crime committed by the American interventionists in Korea has aroused the unanimous indignation of the Korean people and all peace-loving people.

The bloody tragedy in the South Korean prisoner-of-war camps has ruthlessly exposed to the world the hypocrisy and lies of the American representatives in Kaesong, who are attempting to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations by using the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation.

Those member states of the United Nations who are carrying out the will of the American imperialists and supporting their aggression against Korea must, together with the United States, bear the guilt that the aggressors should bear to the Korean people.

The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic resolutely opposes and protests the inhuman treatment of captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies by the US occupation authorities, and demands that the United Nations immediately take measures to stop such atrocities and impose severe international sanctions on the war criminals.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永致电联合国
    抗议美国侵略军屠杀战俘暴行
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在十五日致电联合国秘书处，严正抗议美国侵略军对朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员的血腥屠杀暴行；并将朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在本月十二日发表的痛斥和抗议美帝国主义暴行的声明，通知联合国秘书处。朴宪永的抗议电电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书处
    我现在把朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会抗议美国干涉者对朝中人民军队被俘人员屠杀暴行的声明，通告给联合国各会员国。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和代表南北朝鲜所有爱国政党、社会团体共同意志的朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线的立场完全一致。
    特别值得注意的是连美军司令部的代表、前巨济岛俘虏营负责人杜德和柯尔生，也不得不承认：美占领当局对战俘的暴行，横暴地违反了关于对待战俘的一九四九年八月十二日日内瓦公约和其他国际协定。美国干涉者在朝鲜制造的这种最凶恶的罪行，已经激起了朝鲜人民和一切爱好和平人民的一致愤怒。
    南朝鲜俘虏营的血腥惨案，向全世界无情地揭穿了企图利用遣返战俘问题而拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的在开城的美国代表的伪善和谎言。
    执行美帝国主义者的意旨并支持美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的那些联合国会员国家，必须和美国一起担当侵略者对于朝鲜人民应负的罪责。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决反对和抗议美占领当局对朝中人民军队被俘人员的非人待遇，要求联合国立即采取措施，制止这种暴行，并予战争罪犯以严重的国际制裁。
