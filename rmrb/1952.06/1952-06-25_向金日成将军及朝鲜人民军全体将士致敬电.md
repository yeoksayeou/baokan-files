To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army:

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean people's war against American aggression, we, the democratic parties of China, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, extend our highest respects to you and to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army under your leadership. We warmly congratulate the Korean people and the Korean People's Army on the great victories they have achieved in the heroic struggle of the past two years.

    In the war against American aggression, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, with their heroic actions and great achievements, have inspired all peace-loving and just people, thus making a brilliant contribution to the cause of defending peace for the people of the world. The Korean people's war against American aggression is of international significance. It proves that freedom-loving nations are invincible, and that as long as the whole nation is united and unites with the peace-loving and just people of the world, they can defeat imperialism and strive for national independence and liberation. In today's rising tide of national liberation movements, the era of imperialism running rampant at will is gone forever.

    The Chinese people will always stand with the Korean people. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, will also fight side by side with the Korean People's Army to the end. Our goal is to defend the security of our respective countries and to defend peace in Asia and the world. We believe that the fraternal fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and the unity of the peace-loving and just people of the world are the reliable guarantee for achieving our common goal.

    Long live the fraternal fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
    Long live the world's camp of peace and democracy!
