Summary of Inspection on the Implementation of Contracts and Agreements Signed at the Hebei Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition Last Year
Trade Bureau of the Hebei Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council

The Implementation of Contracts and Agreements Signed Last Year

At the Hebei Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition in 1951, a total of 3,672 contracts and 534 agreements were signed, with a total value of 156.39 billion yuan. The successful execution of these contracts and agreements is significantly related to the organization of urban-rural material exchange, strengthening the planning and reducing the blind spots in production and sales, and promoting the development of industrial, agricultural, and sideline production. Therefore, the Trade Bureau of the Hebei Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council entrusted this Hebei Region Material Exchange Conference to inspect the implementation of contracts and agreements signed last year and promptly address the problems encountered during implementation.

According to this inspection, 87 percent of the contracts and 45 percent of the agreements have been executed. The cancelled contracts accounted for 1 percent of the original contracts, and the cancelled agreements accounted for 5 percent of the original agreements. This indicates that most of the contracts and agreements signed at the Hebei Region Urban-Rural Material Exchange Exhibition last year have been executed. The reasons are: first, the contracts and agreements were signed with more caution and were more in line with reality; second, after the conclusion of the conference, a Contract and Agreement Implementation Inspection Committee was established under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to continuously inspect, supervise, mediate, and arbitrate; third, the local financial and economic committees and industrial and commercial administrative departments constantly supervised; fourth, the parties signing the contracts generally adhered to contract credit. However, due to the fact that a few units did not understand the production and sales situation and blindly ordered goods when signing contracts last year, coupled with the existence of departmentalism and purely profit-seeking viewpoints in their business ideology, and a lack of full understanding of the seriousness of the contract and the legal responsibilities they should bear, some disputes still arose in the process of contract and agreement implementation. Of these disputes, in addition to some that have been promptly handled and resolved, a total of 139 cases were submitted to this Hebei Region Material Exchange Conference for resolution. Through the mediation and arbitration of the conference, a total of 100 cases were resolved (after the closing of the conference, another eight cases were received and resolved, which were not included in the statistics), with a total value of 168.5 billion yuan. In this way, contract credit was maintained, and some of the shortcomings of the contracts and agreements signed in the past were corrected. The most important gain was that everyone further recognized the seriousness of the contract and the legal responsibilities, so everyone was more cautious when signing contracts at this exchange conference, which provided a strong guarantee for the implementation of the contracts and agreements signed this time.

Currently, there are still 39 contract and agreement disputes that have not been resolved. Some of these are because one party to the contract is in another region and did not attend this conference, so they cannot be resolved immediately; others are because the buyer blindly ordered goods in the past and cannot fulfill the contract, while the seller insists on full or partial execution, which is still subject to further mediation and arbitration. These issues need to be further mediated and resolved.

Experience in Inspecting Contracts and Agreements

From this work of inspecting contracts and agreements, we have the following experiences in resolving contract and agreement disputes:

I. It is necessary to clarify the seriousness and legal responsibilities of contracts. At the beginning of this Material Exchange Conference, some units did not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness and legal responsibilities of contracts and agreements, especially the significance of agreements. Many people believe that agreements "are flexible and can be executed or not executed." Some even said, "Free transaction, free cancellation." We repeatedly emphasized that arbitrarily tearing up contracts and agreements is detrimental to the prosperity of the national economy, so all units must earnestly implement the signed contracts, and agreements should not be arbitrarily cancelled. This corrected the above-mentioned erroneous views and attitudes. The conference pointed out that trade workers in the new China must establish a good work style of serving the people, being honest and responsible, keeping their word, and mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and oppose the bad work style of speculation, opportunism, and breach of trust.

II. Resolving contract and agreement disputes must implement the mass line. At the beginning of this work, the conference first invited representatives from various regions to hold discussions, exchange information, and then determine the steps to be taken. The conference first focused on resolving the major disputes of coarse cloth agreements between Hebei Province and Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar, and centrally resolved the problems in the implementation of contracts and agreements between North China and East China, and between North China and Northeast China. This not only promoted the inspection of contracts and agreements, but also increased the enthusiasm of various trade delegations to sign new contracts and agreements at the conference. In dealing with problems, the conference adopted the following methods: (1) Organizing both parties to negotiate and sending people from the Contract and Agreement Inspection Committee to participate in mediation (this is the main method); (2) Organizing both parties to negotiate on their own and inviting a third party to assist in mediation; (3) When both parties insist on their positions and cannot immediately resolve the dispute, conduct individual talks to give them sufficient time to consider and study in order to unify their understanding; when necessary, invite all trade delegations to hold meetings for democratic discussion; after both parties agree, sign a contract. Because we adopted the mass line mediation and arbitration method, we were able to complete the task on time with a short time and few cadres.

III. Mediators must conduct a comprehensive study and analysis of the different opinions held by both parties, clarify the responsibilities of both parties, and criticize and correct the one-sided views of either party at any time to achieve a reasonable resolution of the problem.

On the one hand, we must insist that the contract be executed, on the other hand, we must flexibly grasp the situation according to specific changes. For example, last year, goods were sold quickly, and the prices of some goods at that time were obviously high. Currently, the goods are relatively sluggish, and the prices of some goods have fallen. Therefore, when dealing with problems, we must take into account the current situation and appropriately reduce prices. For example, some places did blindly sign contracts due to insufficient estimates of production and sales when ordering goods last year, or the contracts did not conform to the law of commodity circulation, and now they really cannot be executed, then they should be allowed to cancel part or all of the contracts as appropriate.

Opinions on Signing Contracts and Agreements in the Future

I. It is necessary to further strengthen education on abiding by contract credit. Before signing contracts and agreements, it is necessary to clarify the production and sales situation to avoid the problem of ordering too much with little production, failing to deliver goods, or ordering too much with little sales, failing to sell goods. Only in this way can the contracts and agreements signed be prevented from falling through.

II. The content of contracts and agreements must be specific, so that disputes can be prevented; even if disputes occur, they are easy to handle. Therefore, first, it is necessary to clearly stipulate specifications and quality. In the past, some coarse cloth agreements only had words such as white, uniform, fine, and tight, which were too general. The contract for mulberry branches sold by Hebei to Northeast China, although there was a ratio of upper, middle, and lower grades, did not specify whether they were bundled separately or together. Therefore, disputes arose during the implementation of these contracts and agreements. Second, it is necessary to clearly stipulate the penalties for violating the contract. In the past, some contracts did not stipulate penalties, and some stipulated penalties but were very vague. For example, it only stipulated: "If the goods are not delivered on time, a penalty of 0.5 percent per day will be imposed," while for those who do not pay on time, it simply wrote "a penalty of 0.5 percent will be imposed" without specifying the date, resulting in difficulties in handling. Third, price is also a very important item. The price of long-term futures contracts should be specified according to the local market price of the seller at the time of delivery, so as to avoid price changes at the time of delivery, causing one party to suffer too much. Agreements should also be made as clear as possible on how to calculate the price in the future, otherwise disputes are likely to occur during implementation. Fourth, try to deliver and inspect goods at the place of production. This can avoid delays in delivery, commodity travel, non-compliance with quality specifications, and poor packaging disputes. In addition, conditions such as delivery date, delivery location, payment method, and losses should be specifically and definitely stipulated in the contract. In order to ensure that the content of the contract is specific and clear, material exchange conferences in various places should review the specific content of the contract (procedures should be simple) and then approve it.

III. Sign more contracts and fewer agreements. Generally, units do not pay enough attention to agreements and often easily cancel them or cause disputes due to issues such as price, quantity, and specifications; on the other hand, because of the constraints of the agreement, sellers often dare not sell again, and buyers dare not buy again, which makes hot goods become cold goods, resulting in the accumulation of funds. Therefore, in the future, fewer agreements should be signed and more contracts should be signed; and the tendency to simply pursue the number of contracts and agreements should be prevented. When larger businesses need to sign agreements, the conditions should be specified clearly and specifically.

IV. It is recommended that the relevant central authorities formulate regulations for the execution of contracts. Even now, some individuals easily sign or tear up contracts. Those who knowingly violate the law must be punished according to law.

V. It is recommended to establish a contract inspection agency in the relevant government departments to supervise the implementation of contracts.

    关于去年华北区城乡物资交流展览会上所订合同、协议执行情况的检查总结
    政务院华北行政委员会贸易局
    去年签订的合同、协议的执行情况
    一九五一年华北区城乡物资交流展览会上，共签订合同三千六百七十二件，协议五百三十四件，总值一万五千六百三十九亿余元。这些合同、协议执行的好坏，对组织城乡物资交流，加强产销计划性，减少盲目性，以及推动工、农、副业生产的发展，都有很大的关系。因此，华北行政委员会贸易局委托这次华北区物资交流大会，检查了去年所订合同、协议的执行情况，并及时处理执行中所发生的问题。
    根据这次检查，合同已执行了百分之八十七，协议已执行了百分之四十五；撤销的合同占原订合同的百分之一，撤销的协议占原订协议的百分之五。这说明去年在华北区城乡物资交流展览会上订立的合同、协议，大部分是执行了。其原因是：一、签订合同协议时比较慎重，比较符合实际；二、该会结束以后，即在前中共中央华北局财经工作委员会领导下，成立了合同协议执行检查委员会，不断检查督促和调解仲裁；三、各地财政经济委员会及工商行政部门不断督促；四、签订合同的双方，一般是遵守合同信用的。但是，由于少数单位去年签订合同时不了解产销情况，盲目定货，加以在经营思想上存在着本位主义思想和单纯营利观点，没有充分认识合同的严肃性和应负的法律责任，因此，在合同协议执行过程中仍然发生了一些纠纷。这些纠纷，除一部分已及时处理解决外，提交这次华北区物资交流大会解决的共一百三十九件。经过大会的调解仲裁，共解决了一百件（在大会闭幕后，又继续收到并解决了八件未统计在内），总值一千六百八十五亿元。这样，就维护了合同信用，纠正了过去所订合同、协议的一些毛病。而最主要的收获是使大家进一步认识到合同协议的严肃性和法律责任，因而大家在这次交流大会上签订合同时都比较慎重，给这次所订合同、协议的执行以有力的保证。
    目前还有三十九件合同协议纠纷没有获得解决。其中有些是因合同的一方在外区，这次没有到会，所以不能立刻解决；有些则因买方过去盲目定货而不能执行，卖方坚持全部或部分执行，尚待进一步调解仲裁。这些问题，都有待继续加以调解解决。
    检查合同、协议的经验
    从这次检查合同、协议的工作中，我们对解决合同、协议纠纷，有以下体验：
    一、必须明确合同的严肃性与法律责任。这次物资交流大会开幕之初，有的单位对合同、协议的严肃性和法律责任认识不足，尤其是对协议的意义认识不足。不少人认为协议“是活盘，可执行可不执行”。甚至有人说：“自由成交、自由撤销”。我们反复强调指出，随便撕毁合同、协议对繁荣国家经济不利，因而各单位对已订合同必须认真执行，对协议亦不应随便撤销，这才纠正了上述的错误观点和态度。大会指出新中国的贸易工作者必须树立为人民服务、老实负责、言而有信、互助互利的优良作风，反对投机取巧、不守信用的恶劣作风。
    二、解决合同、协议纠纷，必须贯彻群众路线。这一工作开始时，大会首先邀请各地代表座谈，交流情况，然后确定进行步骤。大会首先有重点地解决了河北省与绥远、山西、察哈尔的大宗的土布协议纠纷，并集中地解决了华北与华东、华北与东北区之间的合同、协议执行中的问题。这样既推进了合同、协议的检查工作，并提高了各贸易代表团在大会上订立新的合同、协议的情绪。在处理问题时，大会采取了以下几种方式：（一）组织双方协商，并由合同协议检查委员会派人参加调解（这是主要方式）；（二）组织双方自行协商，并邀请第三者协助调解；（三）在双方坚持不下，不能立刻解决争议时，则进行个别交谈，给以充分时间考虑研究，以便统一认识；必要时，邀请各贸易代表团开会，进行民主讨论；经双方同意后，订立合约。由于我们采取了走群众路线的调解仲裁方式，所以能在时间短、干部少的情况下，按时完成任务。
    三、调解人对于双方所持不同意见，必须进行全面的研究和分析，弄清双方责任，随时批评和纠正任何一方的片面观点，达到合情合理地解决问题。
    一方面，必须坚持合同要执行，另一方面，又要根据具体情况的变化，灵活掌握。如去年货物销售快，有些货当时所订价格显高，目前货物较疲，有些货价格下降，因此，在处理问题时，就要照顾当前情况，适当降低价格。又如有的地方去年定货时，确因对产销情况估计不足，盲目签订了合同，或不合商品流转规律，现在确实不能执行，这就应该酌情允许其撤销一部或全部。
    对今后订立合同、协议的意见
    一、必须进一步加强关于遵守合同信用的教育。订立合同、协议以前，必须弄清产销情况，以避免产少订多，交不出货，或订多销少，卖不了货的毛病。只有这样，才能使所订合同、协议不致落空。
    二、合同、协议的内容必须具体，这样可以防止发生纠纷；即便发生纠纷，也易处理。因此，第一，要明确规定规格质量。过去有些土布协议，只有白、匀、细、紧等字样，太不具体。河北卖给东北的桑条合同，虽有上、中、下三等的比例，但没有说明分捆或合捆，因此，这些合同协议执行时都发生了纠纷。第二，要明确规定违反合同要受的处分。去年有的合同没有规定处分，有的虽规定了处分但很不明确。比如只规定：“如不按期交货，每超过一日按千分之五处罚”，而对不按期交款者，则简单地只写“按千分之五处罚”，没有说明日期，以致造成处理上的困难。第三，价格也是很重要的一项。较长时期的期货合同的价格，应订明按交货时卖方当地牌价，以免交货时价格变化，使一方吃亏太大。协议也应当尽可能订明白将来如何计算价格，否则到执行时，容易发生争执。第四，尽量作到在产地交货验货。这可以避免延期交货、商品旅行、质量规格不符和包装不好等纠纷。此外，交货日期、交货地点、付款办法、损耗等条件，都应具体肯定地规定在合同上。为了保证合同内容订得具体明确，各地物资交流大会应对合同的具体内容进行审查（要手续简便），然后批准。
    三、多订合同、少订协议。一般单位对协议不够重视，并常因价格、数量、规格等问题轻易撤销，或发生争执；而另一方面，由于有了协议的约束，常使卖方不敢再卖，买方不敢再买，反而使热货也变成冷货，以致积压资金。因此，今后应少订协议，多订合同；并要防止单纯追求合同、协议数字的偏向。较大业务需要订协议时，应把条件规定得明确具体。
    四、建议中央有关机关制定执行合同的条例。现在仍有个别人轻易签订或撕毁合同。对这些明知故犯的人，必须依法给以处分。
    五、建议在政府有关部门，建立合同检查机构，督促合同的执行。
