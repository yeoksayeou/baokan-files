Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 26th. At the twenty-sixth session of the Korean armistice talks, the opposing side could not deny that their proposal was a complete violation of the Geneva Convention, but absurdly attempted to distort the Soviet army's ultimatum to the encircled German and Hungarian forces to surrender during World War II to defend their completely bankrupt claim of detaining prisoners of war. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, sternly pointed out that all the opposing side's distortions and misrepresentations cannot change the fact that the Soviet Union strictly abided by the Geneva Convention and repatriated all prisoners of war it held after World War II, except for war criminals. Nor can it make the opposing side's claim to detain prisoners of war appear to be in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The clear stipulation of the 1949 Geneva Convention is that prisoners of war in the custody of the enemy shall not, under any circumstances, waive their right to be repatriated. The opposing side's April 28th proposal to illegally "screen" prisoners of war and attempt to detain them is a complete and direct violation of the Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to return home to live peaceful lives, is fully in line with the Geneva Convention and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. General Nam Il finally pointed out that the opposing side is taking a series of provocative actions, such as continuing to massacre prisoners of war, attempting to unilaterally handle 27,000 of our captured personnel, continuing to illegally conduct "screenings," and taking steps to threaten the expansion of the Korean War, etc. General Nam Il said that if the opposing side thinks these provocative actions can force us to accept their unreasonable demand to detain prisoners of war, the opposing side should abandon this illusion as soon as possible. Our side insists that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention. This is our firm and unwavering position.

    二十六日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我指斥美方方案违反日内瓦公约
     【新华社开城二十六日电】二十六日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方不能否认对方方案是彻底违反日内瓦公约的，但却荒谬地企图曲解第二次世界大战中苏联军队对被围的德、匈军队命令投降的最后通牒，来替对方已经彻底破产的扣留战俘的主张作辩护。我方首席代表南日将军严词指出，对方一切曲解和歪曲，都不能改变苏联严格遵守日内瓦公约，在第二次世界大战后，遣返了除战争罪犯外所有它所收容的战俘的事实，更不能把对方扣留战俘的主张，说成是符合日内瓦公约的。一九四九年日内瓦公约的明确规定，在敌对一方俘虏状况下的战俘，在任何情况下，都不得放弃他应被遣返的权利。对方对战俘进行非法“甄别”、企图扣留战俘的四月二十八日方案，是彻底地、直接地违反日内瓦公约的。我方五月二日方案使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活，是完全符合日内瓦公约的，是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。南日将军最后指出：对方正采取一系列挑衅行为，如继续屠杀战俘，企图片面处理二万七千我方被俘人员，继续非法进行“甄别”，并采取威胁扩大朝鲜战争的步骤等等。南日将军说，如果对方以为这些挑衅行为能够逼使我方接受对方扣留战俘的无理要求，对方趁早放弃这种幻想。我方坚持战俘遣返问题必须根据日内瓦公约的原则予以解决。这是我们坚定不移的立场。
