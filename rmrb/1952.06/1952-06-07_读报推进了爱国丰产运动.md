    Reading Newspapers Promotes the Patriotic Production Increase Movement

    To the Editors: Rural newspaper reading, carried out in parts of northern Jiangsu Province, has played a positive role in propaganda and mobilization in the patriotic production increase competition and mutual aid and cooperation movement. Recently, more than twenty counties, including Shuyang, Jingjiang, Haimen, and Xinghua, have systematically established newspaper reading groups in various districts, townships, villages, high-yield points, and mutual aid teams, in conjunction with publicity networks. During the spring plowing and sowing process, Shuyang County expanded its newspaper reading groups to 756, absorbing nearly 10,000 farmers to participate in newspaper reading, based on its existing newspaper reading work. In Xinghua County, most of the 340 high-yield groups and 890 fixed mutual aid teams throughout the county have established regular newspaper reading and learning systems.

    In the patriotic production increase movement, in order to ensure that newspaper reading and learning can be sustained, various newspaper reading methods adapted to the production environment have been adopted in various places to achieve "no delay in both production and learning." Some groups use production meetings and work breaks to read newspapers, while others put blackboards on the edges of fields for propaganda at any time.

    The role of newspaper reading groups in the high-yield movement is very significant. At the beginning of the movement, newspaper reading groups in various places publicized the significance of the patriotic production increase movement, explained the ten major agricultural production policies and the principle of "organizing," and broke down the masses' ideological concerns such as "fear of standing out," "fear of burden," "fear of merging families," and "production reaching its peak" and "conservative individual farming." The newspaper reading group in Maduo Township, Funing County, promoted the establishment of 50 mutual aid groups in the township. The newspaper reading group in Qigan Village promoted the organization of two fixed mutual aid groups and eleven temporary mutual aid groups in the village, and also promoted more than 70% of the masses to formulate patriotic production increase plans. The newspaper reading group carried out patriotic education, boosting the masses' enthusiasm for production. After more than a year of newspaper reading and learning, all members of the newspaper reading group in Qunzhang Village, Gangnan District, Yancheng County, have increased their confidence in patriotic production increase. They guarantee that this year's average production of paddy fields will be more than 800 jin per mu, and the average production of dry land will be 190 jin per mu, striving to exceed the production volume of high-yield groups in the whole township. In the process of newspaper reading and learning, the newspaper reading group in Loujia Village, Baoying County, broke many farmers' superstitious ideas, and all members of the group led the masses to cut off more than 100 mu of "ghost wheat" within two days, preventing the spread of diseases and pests. The newspaper reading group in Mazhuang Village, Jianhu County, studied the high-yield experience of advanced mutual aid groups such as Cui Yuxia and Dong Cuiqin, guaranteeing that each member of the group will increase production by 20% this year.

    In many areas, newspaper reading groups have become the center of mass cultural and recreational activities. Experience has shown that doing a good job in newspaper reading can improve the political consciousness of the masses and greatly help various practical work.

    读报推进了爱国丰产运动
    编辑同志：苏北部分地区开展的农村读报工作，在爱国丰产竞赛和互助合作运动中，起了良好的宣传鼓动作用。最近沭阳、靖江、海门、兴化等二十多个县都有计划地在各区、乡、村丰产点和互助组内，和宣传网相结合，普遍地建立了读报组。沭阳县在春耕播种过程中，在原有的读报工作基础上，使读报组发展到七百五十六个，共吸收了近一万名农民群众参加读报。兴化县全县三百四十个丰产组和八百九十个固定的互助组，大都建立了经常的读报学习制度。
    在爱国丰产运动中，为了使读报学习能够坚持下去，各地采取了各种适应生产环境的读报方法，做到“生产学习两不误”。有些组利用生产会议与干活休息时间读报，有些组把黑板牌插到田埂上，随时进行宣传。
    读报组对于丰产运动所起的作用是很显著的。在运动刚开始时，各地读报组都宣传了爱国丰产运动的意义，讲解农业生产十大政策和“组织起来”的方针，打破了群众“怕冒尖”“怕负担”“怕并家”和“增产到顶”“保守单干”等思想顾虑。阜宁县马朵乡的读报组推动全乡建立了五十个互助组。旗杆村的读报组推动全村组织了两个固定互助组、十一个临时互助组，又推动了百分之七十以上的群众订立了爱国丰产计划。读报组进行爱国主义教育，鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。盐城县冈南区群章村读报组经过一年多的读报学习，全体组员提高了爱国丰产的信心，他们保证今年每亩水田平均生产八百多斤稻子，每亩旱田平均生产一百九十斤小麦，争取超过全乡丰产组的生产量。宝应县楼家村读报组在读报学习过程中，打破了许多农民的迷信思想，全组组员带动群众在两天内剪掉一百多亩田的“鬼麦子”，制止了病虫害的蔓延。建湖县马庄村读报组学习崔玉霞、董翠芹等先进互助组的丰产经验，保证今年各个组员增产二成。
    很多地区的读报组成为群众文化娱乐活动的中心。经验证明，搞好读报工作可以提高群众的政治觉悟，对各项实际工作都有很大的帮助。   沈潜
