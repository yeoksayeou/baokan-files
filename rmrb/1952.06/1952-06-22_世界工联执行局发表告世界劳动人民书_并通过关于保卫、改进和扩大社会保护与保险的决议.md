    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Vienna: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which closed in Vienna on the 14th, adopted a letter to the working people of the world for launching the struggle to defend trade union rights and freedoms, stating that the World Federation of Trade Unions expresses its unwavering determination to fight against the war-mongers and their lackeys' attacks on the working people. The purpose of these attacks by the war-mongers is to subject the working masses in capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies to more brutal exploitation and greater poverty, which brings serious harm to the various democratic rights acquired by the working people through long and arduous struggles. However, the working class and all the working people are intensifying their struggles to improve working conditions and living conditions, to defend social laws and trade union rights, and to defend world democracy and freedom. The protest movement is rising, strikes are increasing, and the unity of the working class is becoming increasingly consolidated.
    The letter to the working people of the world, after describing the increasingly fascist attacks adopted by the imperialists in order to undermine the resistance and unity of the working people, and the despicable and shameless divisive activities carried out by using their agents in the trade union movement, emphasized that neither the imperialist repression nor the betrayal of the reactionary trade union leaders can destroy the will of the working people. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions expresses its fraternal solidarity with the just struggle of the working people. The entire experience of the international workers' movement teaches us that the working people must rely mainly on unity of action to successfully defend their rights and achieve their goals. The letter to the working people of the world concludes with a call to the working people of the world: consolidate and expand the struggle to defend trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and closely link it with the struggle to achieve economic and social demands, for national independence and peace. To achieve this goal, trade unions must be stronger and more active, and the broad masses of working people must be united around the trade unions. Expose the capitalist governments' acts of infringing on trade union rights and organize widespread protest movements. Absorb unorganized working people into trade unions and establish trade union organizations where there are no trade unions.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st dispatch from Vienna: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which held a meeting in Vienna, passed a resolution on defending, improving, and expanding social protection and insurance at its closing meeting on the 14th. The resolution states: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions approves the draft plan to convene an international conference on improving and expanding social protection and insurance in Vienna in December 1952. This conference will invite all trade union organizations, all relevant associations and groups, and all those who support social insurance and are willing to defend social insurance in their own countries to participate, regardless of their occupation, social status, and political views.

    世界工联执行局发表告世界劳动人民书
    并通过关于保卫、改进和扩大社会保护与保险的决议
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：十四日在维也纳闭幕的世界工会联合会执行局会议通过了为展开保卫工会权利与自由的斗争告世界劳动人民书，里面说：世界工联对战争贩子及其走狗向劳动人民的进攻的斗争表示不可动摇的决心。战争贩子们的这种进攻的目的是要使资本主义国家及殖民地和附属国的劳动大众遭受更残酷的剥削和更加贫穷，它给劳动人民长期艰苦斗争所获得的各种民主权利带来严重的危害。但是，工人阶级和所有的劳动人民正在为改善劳动条件和生活条件，为保卫社会法律和工会权利及世界民主自由而加紧斗争。抗议运动正日益高涨，罢工也在增多，工人阶级的团结日益巩固。
    告世界劳动人民书叙述了帝国主义者为了破坏劳动人民的反抗和团结所采用的越来越法西斯化的进攻，及利用它们在工会运动中的代理人进行卑鄙无耻的分裂活动后，强调指出：帝国主义的镇压和反动工会头子们的出卖，都不能摧毁劳动人民的意志。世界工联执行局对劳动人民的正义斗争表示兄弟般的声援，国际工人运动的全部经验教给我们：劳动人民要胜利地保卫自己的权利，达到自己的目的，主要应靠行动的一致。告世界劳动人民书最后向世界劳动人民发出号召说：巩固并扩大保卫工会权利与民主自由的斗争，把它和为达到经济与社会要求、为民族独立与和平而进行的斗争紧密地联系起来。为了达到这个目的，必须使工会更加强大、更加活跃、必须把广大的劳动群众团结在工会的周围。揭发资本主义政府侵犯工会权利的行为，组织广泛的抗议运动。吸收没有组织起来的劳动人民参加工会，在没有工会的地方建立工会组织。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：在维也纳举行会议的世界工会联合会执行局在十四日闭幕会议上通过关于保卫、改进和扩大社会保护与保险的决议。决议说：世界工联执行局批准定于一九五二年十二月在维也纳召开国际改进和扩大社会保护与保险会议的草案。这个会议将邀请一切工会组织、一切有关的协会与团体、一切赞成社会保险并愿意在他们国内保卫社会保险的人参加，而不问他们的职业、社会地位与政治见解。
