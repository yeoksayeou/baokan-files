    U.S. Imperialism Will Surely Reap What It Sows
    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
    The U.S. imperialists' barbaric act of bombing the Yalu River power plants is another exposure of their hideous faces before the people of the world, following their use of bacteriological weapons. This inhumane behavior of theirs is bound to be severely punished by the people of the world.
    The Korean armistice talks have been going on for nearly a year. Over the past year, the U.S. imperialists have repeatedly put forward unreasonable proposals, attempting to obtain at the negotiating table what they could not obtain on the battlefield. Today, while dragging out the negotiations, the U.S. imperialists are also carrying out large-scale bombing of non-military facilities in the rear of Korea, as a means of threat and intimidation, in an attempt to force our side to accept their unreasonable proposals. However, this wishful thinking of the U.S. aggressors is doomed to failure. We will never change our firm position because of this barbaric provocative behavior of theirs.
    All the people of China and all peace-loving people of the world will unite more firmly to oppose all the despicable and shameless tricks of the U.S. imperialists. U.S. imperialism is bound to reap the consequences of its doomed failure.

    美帝国主义一定要自食其果

    美帝国主义者轰炸鸭绿江发电厂的野蛮暴行，是它在使用细菌武器后，又一度在世界人民面前暴露它的狰狞面孔。它这种违反人道的行为，一定要受到全世界人民严厉的责罚。
    朝鲜停战谈判将近一年了。一年来，美帝国主义者一再提出无理的方案，企图从谈判桌上取得他们在战场上得不到的东西。今天，美帝国主义者又在它拖延谈判的同时，大规模地轰炸朝鲜后方非军事设施，来作为它威胁恫吓的手段，想迫使我方接受它的无理方案，但是，美国侵略者的这种妄想是注定要失败的。我们决不会因它这种野蛮的挑衅行为而改变我们坚定的立场。
    全中国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民，将会更坚固地团结起来，反对美帝国主义者一切卑鄙无耻的伎俩。美帝国主义者一定要自食其注定了失败的后果。
