    Opinions on Solving the Sales Problem of "Substandard Tobacco" in the Xuchang Area

    To the Editor:

    The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 30th published a letter from reader Li Chengpu, pointing out that the sales of "substandard tobacco" in the Xuchang area are facing difficulties and suggesting that relevant leading organs solve this problem. We believe that this is indeed a serious problem in flue-cured tobacco production; and the fundamental way to solve this problem is to improve the quality of flue-cured tobacco and reduce "substandard tobacco." We call on tobacco farmers in various regions to earnestly do the following three tasks this year: First, transplant tobacco seedlings in a timely manner. Last year, local tobacco farmers delayed the transplanting period due to drought, and some tobacco leaves did not mature, so they were not cured well. This year, after the wheat harvest, we should seize the time to transplant tobacco seedlings in a timely manner to ensure that the tobacco leaves are harvested and cured well before the frost period; second, widely hold technical seminars to exchange experiences. Last year, the planting area of tobacco expanded too quickly, and farmers in newly planted tobacco areas did not have enough experience in technology, so the tobacco was not planted well and the curing was also very bad. This year, various regions should universally hold technical seminars to exchange experience in tobacco planting and curing, vigorously implement cooperative curing, and launch appraisal and competition activities; third, prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Agricultural departments at all levels should fully grasp the medicine and machinery for treating diseases and insects, mobilize and guide the masses to do a good job in disease and insect control. As for the current sales problem of "substandard tobacco," our ministry has already worked with cooperative departments to solve it; we are preparing to vigorously purchase "substandard tobacco" in various regions for the purpose of preventing and controlling cotton aphids. We have also sent a letter to the trade departments asking them to cooperate as much as possible in purchasing "substandard tobacco" of better quality that can be used as raw material for cigarettes.

### 中央农业部农业生产司  关于解决许昌一带“等外烟”销路问题的意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央农业部农业生产司
    关于解决许昌一带“等外烟”销路问题的意见
    编辑同志：五月三十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了读者李诚朴的来信，指出许昌一带“等外烟”的销路发生困难，建议有关领导机关解决这个问题。我们认为，这确是烤烟生产上的一个严重问题；而解决这个问题的根本办法，是要提高烤烟品质，减少“等外烟”。我们号召各地烟农今年切实做好下列三项工作：一、适时移植烟苗。去年当地烟农由于天旱，耽误了移植期，部分烟叶没有成熟，所以烤不好。今年应在麦收后，抓紧时间，及时移植烟苗，保证在霜期以前，把烟叶收完烤好；二、广泛举办技术座谈会，以便交流经验。去年种烟面积扩展太快，新栽烟区的农民，由于技术不熟练，烟种得不够好，烤得也很坏。今年各地要普遍举办技术座谈会，交流种烟和烤烟经验，厉行合作薰烤，并展开评比竞赛运动；三、防治病虫害。各级农业部门应充分掌握治疗病虫的药械，发动并指导群众，做好病虫防治工作。至于目前“等外烟”销路问题，我部已经会同合作部门加以解决；准备在各地大力收购“等外烟”，作为防治棉蚜之用。对品质较好，可作卷烟原料的“等外烟”，我们也已经函请贸易部门尽量配合收购。中央农业部农业生产司
