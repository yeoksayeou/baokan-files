    We Have Some Opinions on Inheriting National Fine Traditions in Music Work
    Shanghai Municipal National Music Workers Xu Guangyi, Wu Jinglue, Chen Yonglu, Sun Yude, Ling Lu
    Editor's Note: Shanghai national music workers Xu Guangyi and others have put forward some useful opinions on the issue of inheriting the national music heritage, which are worthy of attention from the music community. We hope that musicians and music educators will express their opinions.
    We are very pleased to know that Comrade Zhou Yang has come to Shanghai to extensively collect and understand the situation in literary and art circles. Now we offer the following opinions on the issue of inheriting national traditions in music work:
    To implement Mao Zedong's line on literature and art in music work, we must inherit the excellent traditions of our nation. In the three years since liberation, this work has not been done well enough. For example, the music community is still full of ideas of worshiping the West and belittling the national heritage. Only recently has it been criticized. Furthermore, ethnic instrumental music courses in music education in Shanghai seem to be decorative, and no research or reform has been done on ethnic instruments. In terms of research, materials must be extensively collected and sorted out for research, but as far as we know, only a few people at the Tianjin Central Conservatory of Music and a very small number of other units are doing this work. There is no attempt to mobilize the masses, and there has been no preparation for extensive collection, sorting, and research. Of course, the collection and research of folk songs over the years has been successful to some extent.
    We hope to quickly correct this bias. First of all, in this rectification and study in literary and art circles, it must be clearly affirmed that we must inherit the national musical tradition, formulate specific plans and steps for sorting and research, and strengthen theoretical and technical education in national music.
    Regarding the issue of researching national instrumental music and the current situation, we have the following opinions:
    Researching, sorting, and creating national instrumental music is a necessary task for the development and advancement of national music. National musical instruments have the closest relationship with the cultural and recreational life of workers and peasants, and are one of the effective tools for carrying out musical activities in rural areas and factories. They are also of great help in improving opera and dance music. For example, the current opera developed from the yangko opera. If we can make full use of the coordination of national instrumental music organizations, it is very likely that we will create a new mass opera and advance opera a step further. It is also necessary to conduct further specialized research on the music of popular local operas. Therefore, in addition to studying folk songs, we should also pay special attention to the research of instrumental music.
    The Soviet government's special attention to national musical instruments is worth learning from. The following is a quote from the book "The Development of Soviet Art": "The pioneering of musical research based on folk instruments has been extremely effective due to the rewards and guidance of the authorities. All localities are enthusiastically imitating it. This specialized research is centered on the National Conservatory of Music."
    "Many orchestras with xylophone as the main instrument, plus wind instruments, have been organized... Accordion orchestras are the most common among folk instruments."
    National instrumental performance is one of the most popular art forms among the people, and the people are enthusiastically demanding reform of its content. In Shanghai alone, more than one hundred and several dozen national instrumental music groups have been established since liberation (instrumental music organizations in drama and dance troupes are not included). The ten units currently participating in the National Music Groups Friendship Association (organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture) have a total of 316 members, the vast majority of whom are workers. Last year, more than one hundred workers in the Huxi District requested to join the Huxi Workers' Club National Music Group. Does this not show that the masses love their own instrumental art? As for the masses' demand for reform of this art form, it can be confirmed by the following: groups have been requesting new creations; people have repeatedly reflected: "I like to listen to national music very much, but the content is poor, and I only hear these few tunes." Especially recently, after many performances to entertain international friends, the national music community has deeply felt that it must fully explore the splendid national treasure and develop and improve the existing artistic level in order to be worthy of truly representing the musical culture of the Chinese nation. The current situation is far from ideal. Everyone is wondering: since the government wants us to participate in such important performances, why not organize the national music community in a timely manner? It is impossible to catch up with the high tide of cultural construction without creating conditions and without estimating the situation.
    In the past, due to the failure to fully utilize and study the musical form of instrumental music played by national musical instruments that is widely popular in East China, South China and other regions, the research and transformation of musical instruments has become empty talk, which should be paid attention to.
    In the past three years, mainly due to insufficient awareness and understanding, the national music community has not done any research and creation work; nor has it actively strived for the attention of the leadership. Therefore, apart from maintaining the old level of instrumental performance and playing a very small number of new pieces, there have been no other achievements and developments.
    The new creation of folk instrumental pieces is extremely lacking, and the masses are most dissatisfied with this. This is one of the most serious problems in the current national music field. The reason why this problem occurred is that, in addition to the above, national music is popular among the people, and it opposed the music of the court temples in the feudal era, and it is incompatible with the Westernized and decadent music in the era of reactionary comprador bourgeoisie rule. This determines that its main form of existence is amateurish, so the issues of instrumental application (such as national style, harmony, and musical form) have not been systematically sorted and studied, causing difficulties in creation. As for the very few people who can grasp the characteristics of national musical instruments and apply them, they either lack life experience and cannot create musical pieces that express new emotions; or they lack time to conduct creation and research work due to their non-professional reasons. In addition, the failure to vigorously develop mass creation (such as the popularization of technical scientification) is also a reason for the lack of new creation.
    Ideological confusion in music is also a serious problem in the field of national instrumental music. Those musical pieces that are mixed with folk instrumental music, serve the feudal class, and promote "fatalism" and "nihilism," as well as the formalism and decadent musical thoughts of the semi-colonial bourgeoisie, are still spreading freely, without being duly criticized, which has a very bad influence on the people and blurs what we want to inherit.
    Due to the continuous improvement of the people's musical level, and the fact that the national music community is in a stagnant state of self-generation and self-destruction, the existing instrumental music theory and technical level can no longer meet the needs of the people. Last September, the Shanghai National Music Community held a large-scale donation concert in Yiyuan, and the audience had a requirement for improving artistry.
    In addition, there are also problems such as the opposition between scientific and unscientific instrumental techniques, the lack of uniformity in musical scores, and the lack of standards for musical instruments and tuning, which hinder the development of instrumental art.
    The artistic form of national instrumental music organizations is what the people demand to develop and transform. The current difficulty is that there is no organized specialized research, and there is no organized mass force that loves national music to engage in this meaningful work. Therefore, we must first do a good job in research and leadership.
    Based on the above analysis, we suggest that the government, based on the existing conditions, establish an experimental orchestra, and select outstanding members of the masses and experts to serve as the backbone. This kind of orchestra should establish correct leadership relations with the vast number of amateur national music groups, so as to give full play to the power of the masses. This kind of orchestra must strengthen political study, strengthen the study of Western techniques, especially the rich experience of the Soviet Union in music. At the same time, it should lead and carry out sorting and research work in a planned way, organize composers to experience life, create new pieces, conduct research and transformation of musical instruments, and, when certain conditions are met, hold training courses, cultivate new talents, and develop business. If necessary, we can plan to corporatize the orchestra.
    Looking at the organization and distribution of talents in the national instrumental music community throughout the country, Shanghai is the most concentrated and has better conditions, which is suitable for key pilot implementation. It is recommended that the cultural administrative organs lead the pilot establishment of experimental orchestras, gain experience, and promote them throughout the country, so as to lay the foundation for the establishment of a large-scale national music research institute in the future.
    Holding such an experimental orchestra is absolutely necessary for the current music work. Because this is not only to solve the problem of the transformation and development of folk art forms, but also to do a good job in the basic work of developing national music. This is a long-term and arduous task, which will pave the way for the development of national music.
    A certain Soviet musician once said: "The development of Chinese folk instrumental music will occupy a leading position in the oriental Asian music system, and will stand alone as a brilliant banner in the world's musical culture."

### 我们对音乐工作继承民族优良传统问题的一些意见

    我们对音乐工作继承民族优良传统问题的一些意见
    上海市国乐工作者  许光毅、吴景略、陈永禄  孙裕德、凌律
    编者按：上海市国乐工作者许光毅等对继承民族音乐遗产问题，提出了一些有益的意见，值得音乐界加以注意。希望音乐家、音乐教育工作者发表意见。
    我们很高兴地知道周扬同志来上海广泛收集和了解文艺界的情况，现在我们就音乐工作继承民族传统的问题，提供意见如下：
    要在音乐工作上贯彻毛泽东文艺路线，必须继承我们民族的优良传统。解放以来的三年当中，这工作做得很不够。例如音乐界依旧充满着崇拜西洋、轻视民族遗产的思想。直到最近才得到批判。又如上海的音乐教育中的民族器乐的课程，好像点缀品一样，根本没有对民族乐器作过什么研究与改造。再如研究工作方面，按理必须广泛地搜集和整理材料，加以研究，但目前据我们所知，这一工作也只有天津中央音乐院几个人以及其他极少数单位在搞，还没有采用发动群众的方式，没有作广泛地进行搜集、整理、研究的准备。当然，在民歌方面，历年的收集研究工作是有一定成就的。
    我们希望迅速纠正这种偏向。首先要在这次文艺界整风学习中，明确地肯定：必须继承民族音乐传统，制定具体的整理研究计划和步骤，加强民族音乐的理论与技术教育工作。
    关于研究民族器乐的问题和目前的情况，我们有如下的意见：
    研究、整理、创造民族器乐，是发展与推进民族音乐所必需做的工作。民族乐器和工人农民的文娱生活有着最密切的关系，是开展农村和工厂音乐活动的有效工具之一，并且对于戏曲歌舞音乐的改进，也有很大的帮助。例如目前的歌剧就是从秧歌剧基础上发展起来的，假如能充分利用民族器乐组织的配合，很可能创造出新的大众歌剧，将歌剧推进
    一步。又现在流行的地方戏的音乐，也有作进一步专门研究的必要。因此，我们除了必须研究民歌以外，还应该特别重视器乐的研究。
    苏联政府对民族乐器的特别重视，是值得我们借鉴的。下面是“苏联艺术的发展”一书中的话： “以民间乐器为主的音乐研究的开拓，由于当局
    的奖励和指导，奏效极大。各地方都热烈仿行。
    这个专门研究，则由国立音乐专科学校做中心。”
    “组织了许多以木琴为主，加上管乐器的管弦
    乐队，……手风琴乐队是民间乐器中最普遍的。”
    民族乐器演奏是人民最喜爱的艺术形式之一，人民热烈要求改革它的内容。就上海而言，解放以来，民族器乐团体的成立在一百几十个单位以上（戏剧歌舞团体的器乐组织尚未计算在内）。现在参加国乐团体联谊会（上海市文化局领导组织的）的十个单位，其人数达三百十六人，其中工人占极大多数。去年沪西区工人要求参加沪西工人俱乐部国乐组的有百余人。这不是说明了群众热爱自己的器乐艺术吗？至于群众对这种艺术形式要求改革，可以从下列一事得到佐证：各团体纷纷要求新创作；不断有人反映说：“国乐是很喜欢听的，就是内容贫乏，听来听去只有这几只曲子。”特别是近来经过多次招待国际友人的表演后，国乐界深深地感到必须充分发掘灿烂的民族的宝藏，发展并提高现有的艺术水平，才称得上真正的代表中华民族的音乐文化。现在的情况却距离理想太远了。大家都在疑惑：政府既要我们参加这样重要的表演，为什么不及时把国乐界组织起来呢？目前不创造条件、不估计情况，是无法赶上文化建设高潮的。
    在过去，由于对广泛流行于华东华南和其他地区的、用民族乐器演奏以器乐曲为主的音乐形式，未予充分利用与研究，使乐器的研究与改造成为空谈，这是应该予以注意的。
    三年来国乐界主要的由于觉悟与认识不够，没有作什么研究和创作工作；也没有主动地争取领导方面的重视。因此，除在乐器的演奏上，仍保持旧有的水平，演奏了极少数的一些新曲外，没有其他成就和发展。
    民间器乐曲的新创作是异常缺乏的，群众对此最为不满，这是目前国乐方面最严重的问题之一。这个问题之所以发生，除以上所述外，还因为国乐是流传于民间的，在封建时代与宫廷庙堂音乐相对抗，在反动买办资产阶级统治的时代，则与洋化堕落音乐不相容。这就决定了它的存在底主要形式是业余性，因而对于器乐应用问题（如民族风格、和声、曲式等问题），还未能加以系统的整理和研究，造成了创作上的困难。至于极少数能够掌握民族乐器的特性而加以应用者，或缺乏生活体验，无法创作表现新感情的乐曲；或由于非专业的缘故，缺少时间来进行创作和研究工作。此外没有大力展开培养群众创作（如技术科学化的普及工作等）也是缺乏新创作的原因。
    音乐上的思想混乱现象，也是民族器乐方面的严重问题。那些跟民间器乐曲混在一起的、为封建阶级服务的、宣传“命定论”、“虚无主义”的乐曲，以及半殖民地资产阶级的形式主义、颓废主义的音乐思想，依然很自由地传扬着，没有得到应有的批判，给了人民很坏的影响，模糊了我们所要继承的东西。
    由于人民的音乐水准不断地提高，而国乐界又处在自生自灭的停留状态，现有的器乐理论与技术水平已愈来愈不能满足人民的要求了。去年九月，上海国乐界在逸园举行大规模的捐献音乐会，听众就有提高艺术性的要求。
    此外还有器乐技术上的科学与不科学的对立，乐谱的不统一，乐器与定音漫无标准等等问题，也都阻碍了器乐艺术的发展。
    民族器乐组织的艺术形式是人民要求发展和改造的。目前的困难是在于没有组织专门研究，没有组织广大喜爱国乐的群众力量来从事这项有意义的工作。因此，首先必须做好研究工作与领导工作。
    根据上述的分析，我们建议政府根据现有的条件，创立一个实验乐团，挑选群众中的优秀分子和专家充当骨干。这种乐团应与广大业余国乐团体建立正确的领导关系，借以充分发挥群众力量。这种乐团必须加强政治学习，加强学习西洋技巧，特别是苏联在音乐上的丰富经验。同时有步骤地领导展开整理研究工作，组织作曲者体验生活，创作新曲，进行乐器的研究和改造，并在具备一定条件的情况下，举办训练班，培养新人才，发展业务。必要时可以计划乐团企业化。
    再从全国民族器乐的组织和人才散布情形看，上海最为集中，条件较好，适合于重点试行。建议由文化行政机关领导试办实验乐团，取得经验，推行全国，为将来设立规模宏大的民族音乐研究院奠定基础。
    举办这样一个实验乐团，对目前音乐工作来说，是完全必要的。因为这不仅是解决民间艺术形式的改造和发展问题，而且是必须做好发展民族音乐的基础工作。这是一个长期而又艰巨的工作，它将为民族音乐铺平发展的道路。
    苏联某音乐家曾经说：“中国民间器乐的发展，将在东方亚洲的音乐体系中占首要地位，将在世界音乐文化中独树光辉的一帜。”
