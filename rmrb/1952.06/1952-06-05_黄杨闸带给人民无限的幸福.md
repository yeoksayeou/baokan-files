    The Huangyang Sluice Brings Limitless Happiness to the People
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Ai Ding
    On May 12th, thousands upon thousands of farmers of Mongolian and Han ethnicities from the Houtao region of Suiyuan, dressed in colorful festive attire, flocked to Huangyang Mutou on the west bank of the Yellow River in Micang County to attend the water release ceremony of the Huangyang Sluice. As the rolling Yellow River water flowed through the raised sluice gates, rushing into the three major canals of the Wula River, Huangji Canal, and Yangjia River, the tens of thousands of Mongolian and Han farmers participating in the ceremony on both banks cheered in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    "Of all the Yellow River's hazards, only Houtao is rich." The Houtao region, located along the left bank of the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province, covers an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers, with about 15 million mu of cultivable land. As early as the early Qing Dynasty, farmers in this area began to dig canals to divert Yellow River water for irrigation. Over the past two hundred years, farmers have used their diligence and wisdom to dig ten major canals, including the Huangji Canal, Yangjia River, and Wula River; the total number of branch canals and sub-branch canals is about five hundred, irrigating more than three million mu of farmland, becoming the largest irrigation area in the history of Saiwai (outside the Great Wall) with the greatest irrigation efficiency. Many water conservancy experts and engineers who have visited here have expressed surprise and admiration for the great creation of the farmers. However, during the reactionary rule, these irrigation canals dug by the working people were occupied by bureaucrats and landlords. Farmers had to sell their children to pay water fees, and had to neglect their fields to work for water. When farmers needed water, they had to wait until the landlords had finished watering their land. Yan San, a farmer from the first district of Langshan County, was stabbed to death with an iron fork by the landlord Qu Siqi for watering his land without the landlord's permission.
    Under the devastation of the reactionary rule, most of the canals here were silted up due to years of disrepair, and the irrigated area shrank day by day. During the flood season, floods poured into the canals, and farmers along the banks suffered from spring droughts and autumn floods every year. The largest flood in 1943 inundated 400,000 mu of cultivated land. The Kuomintang reactionary government also repaired the Huangyang Sluice, but after three years of construction, the farmers were extorted 40,000 dan of grain, and only two pits were dug. Farmers recalled the past and said: "The landlord's water conservancy is the poor man's disaster."
    After liberation, the more than 300,000 farmers in the Houtao region of Suiyuan also turned themselves over in water conservancy. The landlords and despots were overthrown, and the power of water conservancy and irrigation was returned to the farmers. In the past two years, nearly 200,000 Mongolian and Han farmers in the Houtao region have actively participated in repairing the canals. The farmers along the various branch canals have successively organized their own branch canal management committees to implement democratic management and rational water use. For the long-term happiness of the people of Houtao, the People's Government has led the farmers since May 1950 to build the large-scale modern engineering Huangyang Sluice at the confluence of the Huangji Canal, Yangjia River, and Wula River. During the construction of the project, patriotic labor competitions were launched at various construction sites, and new creations, new records, and labor models continued to emerge from the masses. Women, who rarely went to the fields in the past, now carried iron shovels and baskets and worked like men; many branch canals were dug by them. They said: "In the past, we dug for the landlords, but now we dig for ourselves, and we have great strength!" This project was completed in September 1951. After all the canals, large and small, such as the Huangji Canal, Yangjia River, and Wula River, are dredged, the irrigated area will be expanded to 2.8 million mu. More than 100,000 mu of farmland, which suffered from spring droughts and autumn floods for many years, can be freed from disasters, and millions of mu of alkaline land and wasteland can be turned into fertile land. This spring, the Micang, Linhe, Langshan, and Wuyuan counties in the Shanba Special District also held a water conservancy representative meeting to discuss and decide on the construction plan for this year's annual repair projects of various trunk canals and branch canals. Until the Huangyang Sluice was released, the project of dredging the trunk canals and branch canals was still under construction.
    Now, the Houtao region has become a fertile plain with crisscrossing canals. On this land rich in wheat, millet, flax, sunflower seeds, as well as rice, soybeans, and corn, the industrious Mongolian and Han farmers are now also trying to plant cotton, peanuts, sugar beets, and rubber grass. Hami melons can also be grown in Wuyuan County. Now, the annual output of grain in the Houtao region can not only meet its own needs, but also export 40 to 50 million jin. The quality of Houtao flax enjoys a high reputation in the international market and can be made into more than 30 kinds of chemical raw materials. Sunflower seeds are also sold to Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places. The annual output of more than 17 million jin of Zhiqicao in Houtao has become a welcome raw material for paper mills in Beijing, Tianjin and other places.
    The completion of the Huangyang Sluice is only the beginning of the happy life of the people of Houtao. There are three other projects of similar scale to the Huangyang Sluice to be built. That is, a dam and a reservoir will be built across the Yellow River; the various branch canals need to be scientifically reorganized and modern equipment engineering will be constructed. After the completion of these renovation projects, the irrigation area of Houtao will be expanded to more than 13 million mu, making Houtao the largest granary in North China. On this vast plain, there are also good conditions for mechanized farming. The people of Houtao are working hard in creation, striving for the beautiful scenery of collective production!

    黄杨闸带给人民无限的幸福
    新华社记者　艾丁
    五月十二日，绥远后套地区成千上万的蒙、汉两族农民，穿着各色各样的节日服装，成群结队地赶到米仓县黄河西岸的黄杨木头，参加黄杨闸的放水典礼。当滚滚黄水通过高启的闸门，奔流进乌拉河、黄济渠、杨家河三大干渠时，两岸千万个参加观礼的蒙、汉两族农民，一致欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    “黄河百害，唯富一套”。绥远省沿黄河左岸的后套地区，面积约有一万平方公里，可以耕种的土地约有一千五百多万亩。早在清初这一带农民就开始开渠引黄水灌田。二百多年来，农民以自己的勤劳和智慧，开挖了黄济渠、杨家河、乌拉河等十大干渠；支渠和支子渠合计约有五百多条，灌溉的农田曾达到三百多万亩，成为我国塞外历史上灌溉面积最广，灌溉效能最大的一块灌溉区。到过这里的不少水利专家和工程师，对农民们这种伟大创造，都表示惊讶和钦佩。但在反动统治时期，这些劳动人民所开挖的灌溉渠道，都为官僚、地主所霸占。农民为了缴水费卖掉自己的儿女，为了出水勤荒芜了自己的田地。农民要用水时，还得等到地主浇完了地。狼山县一区农民阎三曾因浇水未经地主允许，被地主屈四其用铁叉扎死。
    在反动统治的摧残下，这里的渠道大部都因年久失修而淤塞，灌溉面积一天比一天缩小。每逢汛期，洪水涌进渠道，沿岸农民每年都受到春旱秋涝的灾害。一九四三年最大一次水灾被淹耕地达四十万亩。国民党反动政府也修过黄杨闸，施工三年，农民被敲诈去粮食四万石，结果只挖了两个坑。农民回忆着过去说：“地主的水利，穷人的害。”
    解放后，绥远后套地区的三十多万农民，在水利上也翻了身。地主恶霸被打倒，水利灌溉大权归还给农民了。两年多来，后套地区有近二十万的蒙汉两族农民，积极参加整修渠道。各支渠沿岸的农民，都先后组织起自己的支渠管理委员会，实行民主管理合理用水。人民政府为了后套人民的长远幸福，从一九五○年五月起又领导农民，在黄济渠、杨家河、乌拉河汇流渠首，兴建规模宏大的现代化工程黄杨闸。在修建工程中，各工地都发起爱国劳动竞赛，新创造、新纪录和劳动模范不断从群众中涌现出来。过去很少下地的妇女，这次也扛着铁锹、箩头和男子一样劳动；很多支渠都是她们挖成的。她们说：“过去是给地主挖，现在给自己挖，劲大着哩！”这个工程到一九五一年九月修成。待黄济渠、杨家河、乌拉河等大小渠道全部疏浚后，灌溉面积将可扩大到二百八十万亩，过去长年遭受春旱秋涝的十多万亩农田，可以解除灾害，使百万亩碱地和荒地变为良田。今春陕坝专区的米仓、临河、狼山、五原等县又召开了水利代表会议，讨论决定了今年的各干渠、支渠的岁修工程施工计划。直到黄杨闸放水之前，疏浚干渠、支渠的工程仍在兴工。
    现在，后套地区又变成一块渠道纵横的肥沃平原了。在这块丰产小麦、糜米、胡麻、瓜子以及水稻、大豆、玉蜀黍的土地上，勤劳的蒙、汉农民，现在又试植成棉花、花生、甜菜和橡胶草，五原县还可以种植哈密瓜。现在，后套地区每年出产的粮食除可自给外，还可向外输出四千到五千万斤。后套胡麻的质量在国际市场上享有盛誉，可以制成三十多种化学原料。瓜子也远销广州、上海等地。后套年产约一千七百多万斤的枳机草，成为北京、天津等地造纸厂所欢迎的原料。
    黄杨闸的修成，仅是后套人民幸福生活的开始。与黄杨闸差不多大小的工程还有三处要兴修。这就是在横跨黄河地段要修建一个拦河坝和一个蓄水库；各个支渠需要再加以科学的整理，建筑近代化的设备工程，完成这些整修工程，后套灌溉面积将要扩大到一千三百多万亩。可使后套成为华北最大的粮仓。在这块千里平原上，机器耕种也有良好条件。后套人民正在劳动创造中，为集体生产的美景而努力！
