The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has announced the "List of Commonly Used Characters." The "List of Commonly Used Characters" contains a total of one thousand five hundred characters, compiled based on frequently occurring characters in sources such as literacy primers, dictionaries, commonly used character collections, literacy textbooks for workers and peasants, printing press and Chinese typewriter fonts, worker literacy statistics, current news, documents, and literary works. When compiling the "List of Commonly Used Characters," the former Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education examined the common usage of these characters and sought opinions from experts at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Dictionary Compilation Office of Beijing Normal University, making necessary additions and deletions, proving that these one thousand five hundred characters are the most commonly used. The list was also approved by the preparatory meeting of the Chinese Language Reform Research Committee of the Ministry. The application of commonly used characters is not to limit the number of characters people learn, but to extract the most commonly used single characters in various general books and newspapers for reference in literacy education. Learning one thousand five hundred commonly used characters allows one to understand about ninety-five percent of the text in popular books and newspapers. Various elementary teaching materials and popular reading materials should be based on these commonly used characters, supplemented by some single characters especially needed by different occupations, different regions, or different application scopes, to reduce the difficulties for readers. Commonly used characters can also be used as a reference for promoting rapid literacy methods.

### 中央人民政府教育部公布“常用字表”

    中央人民政府教育部公布“常用字表”
    中央人民政府教育部已公布“常用字表”。“常用字表”共一千五百个单字，是根据文盲字汇、字典、常用字汇统计、工农识字课本、印刷厂和华文打字机的字盘、工人识字统计、时事新闻、文件和文艺作品等材料中经常出现的单字编选的。教育部前社会教育司在编选“常用字表”时，曾检验了这些常用字的常用性，并征求了中国科学院语言研究所和北京师范大学中国大辞典编纂处等专家的意见，作了必要的增删，证明这一千五百个单字是最常用的。字表并经该部中国文字改革研究委员会筹备会会议通过。常用字的应用，并不是限制人们学习文字的数目，而是把各种通常书报中应用得最普遍的一部分单字提出来，供识字教育学习的参考。学会一千五百个常用字，约可读懂通俗书报中百分之九十五的文字。各种初级教材和通俗读物，应以这些常用字为基础，再补充一些不同职业、不同地区或不同应用范围所特别需要的单字，来减少阅读者的困难。常用字并可供推行速成识字法的参考。
