    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government Decides to Change the Names of Repeated Counties and Cities Nationwide

    Readers Lü Shoupeng, Qian Shubin, and Yu Le wrote: The names of some counties and cities nationwide are repeated, which is very inconvenient for postal delivery work. As far as we know, there are ten places with duplicate names, such as Xi'an City (both in the Northwest and Liaodong), Changshan County (both in Lüda and Shandong), and Jianyang County (both in Northern Jiangsu and Fujian). Therefore, we suggest that relevant authorities make corrections. The opinions of readers Lü Shoupeng and others are correct. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government notified the competent departments in the relevant areas in December 1951 to propose new names for the repeated counties and cities with shorter historical usage, and report them to the Central Government for approval and promulgation. So far, the counties and cities that have been renamed are: Longsheng County in Suiyuan Province (with the same name as Longsheng County in Guangxi Province) has been changed to Zhuozi County, Taian County in Heilongjiang Province (with the same name as Taian County in Shandong Province) has reverted to its original name Yian County, Xinmin County in Guangdong Province (with the same name as Xinmin County in Western Liaoning Province) has been renamed Tunchang County, and Xi'an City in Liaodong Province (with the same name as Xi'an City in the Northwest Region) has been renamed Liaoyuan City. The remaining counties and cities with duplicate names will also be renamed.

    中央人民政府内务部决定更改全国重复的县市名称
    读者吕寿彭、钱树彬、于乐来信说：全国有些县、市的名称是重复的，这对邮电寄递工作很不方便。据我们所知，就有西安市（西北、辽东都有）、长山县（旅大、山东都有）、建阳县（苏北、福建都有）等十个重名地方。因此建议有关机关加以改正。读者吕寿彭等的意见是正确的。中央人民政府内务部已在一九五一年十二月，通知各有关地区的主管部门，把重名县市中沿用历史较短的另拟新名，报请中央核定后公布通行。到现在为止，已经改名的县市有：绥远省龙胜县（与广西省龙胜县重名）改为卓资县，黑龙江省泰安县（与山东省泰安县重名）恢复原名依安县，广东省新民县（与辽西省新民县重名）改名屯昌县，辽东省西安市（与西北区西安市重名）改名辽源市。其余重名县市也都将改定新名。
