    Consolidate Victory, Strive for Final Victory
    Li Xuesan, Head of the Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Home

    June 25th marks the second anniversary of the Korean War of Aggression launched by U.S. imperialism, the anniversary of the Korean people's heroic uprising against U.S. aggression and the start of the great Patriotic War, and also the day when peace-loving people all over the world fight against U.S. imperialism's launching of war and defend world peace. While launching the Korean War of Aggression, U.S. imperialism also occupied our territory of Taiwan, and regardless of the solemn warnings of our people, and in contempt of the wishes of the people of the world to oppose war and strive for peace, expanded the Korean War and brazenly burned the flames of its war of aggression to the sacred border of our motherland - the Yalu River. In order to safeguard the security of the motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, our people rose up as one, launching a vigorous "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" movement. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on October 25, 1950, raised the great banner of resisting aggression and defending peace, and marched to the forefront of resisting America and aiding Korea. In the twenty months of struggle, we fought side by side with the heroic Korean people, inflicting a series of heavy blows on the U.S. imperialist aggressor army and the Syngman Rhee gang, annihilating more than 500,000 enemies, driving the enemy back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, disrupting the U.S. aggression war timetable, thwarting U.S. imperialism's attempt to occupy North Korea, causing the enemy to suffer major losses in manpower, equipment, and technology, powerfully striking at the U.S. imperialist's frenzied aggression, and inspiring the confidence of the people of the world in defending peace. The facts of the past twenty months have proved that U.S. imperialism can be completely defeated.
    The great struggle to resist America and aid Korea is a just struggle to defend peace and oppose aggression, representing the common aspirations of the people of China, the East, and even the peace-loving people of the whole world. Therefore, this struggle must be victorious and will surely be victorious. Every commander and fighter of our Volunteer Army deeply understands that resisting America and aiding Korea is inseparable from protecting our homes and defending the country, and therefore demonstrated the greatest courage in the war and overcame unimaginable difficulties. In the past twenty months, a large number of heroic figures have emerged in our army, who have made immortal contributions to the Chinese and Korean people. Everyone is full of optimism and firmly believes that our struggle will surely achieve final victory. In the twenty months of war, we have become stronger and stronger. We have continuously improved and enhanced our tactics and techniques, learned offensive warfare, defensive warfare, and mountain warfare, and can effectively organize the coordinated operations of various weapons and services in various wars. Thanks to the full support of the people of the motherland, our equipment has gradually been improved, and our technology has been rapidly improved. Now we have begun to be able to give the enemy heavier blows from all aspects, from the sky to the ground, from land to sea, with the cooperation of various services. Since our strong artillery and brave air force appeared on the Korean front, the U.S. aggressors have become even more embarrassed and uneasy. The "air superiority" and "technical superiority" it has always boasted of are declining day by day, and the enemy's outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger image has become more clearly exposed to the people of the world. What particularly excites us is that during our four-month-plus work assignment in returning to the country, we have personally witnessed our great motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, leaping forward from one victory to another, one movement after another. The various constructions of the motherland have achieved brilliant victories, and our motherland has become stronger. The twenty months of struggle since we went abroad have fully proved that with the full support of the people of our great motherland, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fully confident of crushing any offensive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and striving for the final victory of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea.
    In the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, the Korean people and the People's Army have displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and demonstrated unlimited loyalty, bravery, and perseverance. In the war for independence, freedom and honor, the heroic Korean people and army have become stronger and stronger. In the past two years, more than 260,000 people in the Korean People's Army have received military merit medals from the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean People's Army has been trained into a powerful and invincible force. The unbreakable fighting friendship cemented with blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples in battle has formed an invincible force against U.S. imperialist aggression and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
    In the just struggle to resist America and aid Korea, the peace-loving people of the world stand with us. On the Korean battlefield, we have continuously received close assistance from the Korean people, and have received extensive sympathy and support from the people of various people's democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world. We firmly believe that our just struggle will surely achieve final victory.
    As we commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War of Anti-Aggression with full confidence in victory, U.S. imperialism, after suffering a shameful defeat in the bacteriological warfare it launched, is still continuing to adhere to its policy of aggression, massacring our captured personnel in large numbers, and wantonly delaying the Korean armistice negotiations. Therefore, we must not have any slackness or complacency. We must abide by the will of the people of the motherland, continue to hold our weapons tightly, vigilantly guard our posts, consolidate the victories we have achieved, and fight to the end to realize a peaceful solution to the Korean problem and strive for a victorious end to the war of anti-aggression, and to defend the motherland and defend peace.

专栏：纪念朝鲜反侵略战争两周年

    巩固胜利，争取最后胜利
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长　李雪三
    六月二十五日是美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的两周年，是朝鲜人民奋起反抗美国侵略展开伟大的卫国战争纪念日，也是全世界爱好和平人民反对美帝国主义发动战争，保卫世界和平的战斗日子。美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，侵占了我国的领土台湾，并不顾我国人民庄严警告，蔑视全世界人民反对战争争取和平的愿望，扩大侵朝战争，悍然将他的侵略战争火焰燃烧到我们祖国神圣边界——鸭绿江边。为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫远东和全世界的和平，我国人民一致奋起，掀起了轰轰烈烈的“抗美援朝，保家卫国”运动，我们中国人民志愿军于一九五○年十月二十五日高举起反抗侵略保卫和平的大旗，走向抗美援朝的最前线。在二十个月的斗争中，我们和英雄的朝鲜人民并肩作战，给了美帝国主义侵略军及李承晚匪帮以一连串的沉重的打击，歼灭敌人五十余万，把敌人从鸭绿江边赶回到三八线附近，打乱了美国侵略战争的时间表，使美帝国主义妄图占领北朝鲜的计划宣告破产，使敌人在人力、装备、技术上都受到重大的损失，有力地打击了美帝国主义疯狂的侵略气焰，鼓舞了全世界人民保卫和平的信心。二十个月来的事实证明，美帝国主义是完全可以被打败的。
    伟大的抗美援朝斗争，是保卫和平、反对侵略的正义斗争，代表着全中国全东方乃至全世界爱好和平的人民的共同愿望，因此这个斗争必须胜利，也一定能够胜利。我们志愿军的每一个指挥员、战斗员，都深刻了解抗美援朝与保家卫国是不可分的，因而在战争中表现了最大的勇敢，战胜了难以想像的各种困难。二十个月来，我们部队中已创造了大批的英雄人物，他们为中朝人民立下了不朽的功勋，大家都充满了乐观主义情绪，坚信我们的斗争必然会取得最后的胜利。在二十个月的战争中，我们是愈战愈强了，我们不断地改进与提高了战术技术，学会了进攻战、防御战和山岳战，并能在各种战争中有效地组织各种武器和各兵种的协同作战。由于祖国人民的全力支援，我们的装备也逐渐得到改善，我们的技术也迅速地提高了，现在我们已开始能够从天上到地下、从陆地到海洋，在各兵种配合之下，从各方面给予敌人更沉重的打击。自从我们坚强的炮兵和勇敢的空军出现在朝鲜前线后，美国侵略者便更加狼狈不安起来，他一向吹嘘的“空军优势”和“技术优势”，正在一天一天地走着下坡路，敌人外强中干的纸老虎像，已经更明显地暴露在全世界人民的面前。特别使我们兴奋的是：我们在四个多月的归国工作任务中，亲眼看到了我们伟大的祖国，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，正在一个胜利接着一个胜利，一个运动接着一个运动地飞跃前进。祖国的各项建设都取得了辉煌胜利，我们的祖国已经变得更加强大起来。我们出国以来的二十个月的斗争过程中，充分证明了我们中国人民志愿军有了伟大祖国人民的全力支援，完全有把握可以粉碎美帝国主义的任何进攻阴谋，争取抗美援朝斗争的最后胜利。
    在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，朝鲜人民和人民军，发挥了高度的爱国主义热忱，发挥了无限的忠诚、英勇、和坚毅的精神；在争取独立、自由与荣誉的战争中，英雄的朝鲜军民已愈战愈强；两年来，朝鲜人民军中有二十六万人以上，得到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的军功章，朝鲜人民军已锻炼成为一支必胜不败的强大的部队。中朝人民从战斗中用血肉凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊，已经形成反抗美帝国主义侵略和维护远东与世界和平的一支不可战胜的力量。
    在抗美援朝的正义斗争中，全世界爱好和平的人民，都和我们站在一起。在朝鲜战场上，我们不断得到朝鲜人民的密切的协助，并得到了来自各人民民主国家和世界爱好和平人民的广大同情和声援。我们坚信：我们的正义斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。
    当我们满怀胜利信心，纪念朝鲜反侵略战争两周年的时候，美帝国主义在其所发动的细菌战遭受到可耻的失败之后，仍在继续坚持侵略政策，大批屠杀我被俘人员，肆无忌惮地拖延朝鲜停战谈判。因此，我们绝不能有任何的松懈和自满，我们一定遵照祖国人民的意志，继续紧握我们的武器，警惕地紧守在我们的岗位上，巩固已得的胜利，为实现和平解决朝鲜问题和争取反侵略战争的胜利结束，为保卫祖国、保卫和平而战斗到底。
