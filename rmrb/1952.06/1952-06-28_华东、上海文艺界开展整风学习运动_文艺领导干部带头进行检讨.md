East China and Shanghai Literary and Art Circles Launch Rectification and Study Movement
Leading Literary and Art Cadres Take the Lead in Self-Criticism

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," East China and Shanghai literary and art circles launched a rectification and study movement. This movement was carried out after literary and art workers participated in the democratic reform movement in state-owned factories, the land reform movement, the Huai River harnessing work, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and gained some ideological enlightenment. The participants in this literary and art rectification and study are generally limited to government literary and art departments (including film studios), literary and art groups, and specialized art schools, with the focus on leading cadres at all levels of literary and art work and professional creative cadres. At the study mobilization meeting held on May 22, Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, pointed out that the literary and art work in East China and Shanghai has made great achievements in the past three years, but there are still serious shortcomings and errors. He emphasized the importance of ideological transformation for literary and art workers, calling on everyone to use Marxist-Leninist theory as a weapon to conduct criticism and self-criticism in this study, to seriously criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, and to establish the viewpoint of the working class ideology as the only guiding ideology, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main service objects.

At the meeting, Xia Yan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Huang Yuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Yu Ling, Director of the Shanghai Film Studio and Director of the Shanghai United Film Studio, all made preliminary self-criticisms of their leadership work over the past three years. Xia Yan said that his main mistake in literary and art leadership was relaxing and even abandoning the right-leaning tendency to conduct class struggle in the field of literary and art ideology. The main manifestations were: allowing the offensive and erosion of non-working class ideology on the literary and art front, failing to make efforts to expand and consolidate the leading position of working class ideology; allowing the broad mass of petty-bourgeois literary and art workers to stubbornly promote their views with literary and art works based on non-working class ideology, and failing to make efforts to transform their thinking; and allowing privately-run cultural and artistic undertakings to exist in an inflated manner and develop spontaneously, without conducting investigation, supervision, and leadership in a step-by-step and planned manner. Xia Yan also analyzed that the ideological source of these mistakes was due to the long-term influence of bourgeois ideology and insufficient close ties with the working people, and his ideology and feelings had not undergone profound transformation. He said:

"In the past, a lot of what I learned was one-sided rational knowledge that I had not truly grasped through practice; after liberation, I did not conduct in-depth and arduous study of the various policies stipulated by Chairman Mao and the Party. Therefore, in the new situation... I could not stand firm, I was not good at using Chairman Mao's ideological weapon, and I was not good at observing and solving problems from the perspective of class analysis." In addition, he criticized his serious liberalistic work style and lack of organizational discipline as an important cause of his mistakes.

Huang Yuan criticized his serious bureaucratic errors, such as being indifferent to creative activities and the cultural activities of workers and peasants, but being obsessed with trivial affairs and external socializing. He said that these errors were due to his unstable class stand, failure to put down the airs of a "cultural person" and go deep among the masses; and failure to seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Yu Ling pointed out that in his film leadership work, he neglected the necessity of ideological transformation of film art workers, and did not vigorously organize them to go into life and struggle for training, which fostered the complacency and erroneous thinking of some comrades. For example, some people believe that "life experience is important, but technology is more important," "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers is important, but the number of petty-bourgeois moviegoers is large, and they should also be served," and "although the ideological content of American imperialist films is not good, their 'skills' and 'acting' are first-rate and worth learning from." Yu Ling pointed out that because he retained petty-bourgeois ideology, he did not recognize the seriousness of the above-mentioned ideological errors, did not criticize them as he should, and also lost his ability to discern the film "The Life of Wu Xun."

After more than 20 days of study, the literary and art workers participating in the rectification have begun to recognize the harm of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in literary and art work, and thus have a deeper understanding of the necessity and urgency of transforming the ideology of petty-bourgeois literary and art workers. As of the 15th of this month, comrades such as Yi Bing, Ye Yiqun, Ke Lan, Mi Gu, and He Luting have successively published self-criticism articles in newspapers and periodicals such as the "Liberation Daily."

Yi Bing, Deputy Director of the Art Affairs Administration Office of the East China Culture Department, pointed out in his article "Correcting Mistakes and Striving for the 'Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New' of Opera Art" that he did not resolutely implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" in opera reform work, relaxed or even abandoned ideological leadership, and neglected the importance of ideological transformation of opera workers. He adopted an unprincipled tolerant attitude towards the then-popular policy of attempting to replace "Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" with the so-called "raising a step on the original basis," and attempting to replace the policy of "First for the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers" with the slogan "Opera should not be separated from petty-bourgeois audiences, and should focus on educating petty-bourgeois." Yi Bing criticized that due to his impetuous emotions and desire for quick success in his ideological style, he showed timidity in the arduous ideological struggle, and pursued superficially spectacular scenes. On the one hand, he seriously neglected the work of sorting out and approving the old repertoires of local operas, so that most of the small and medium-sized theaters still performed unreformed old plays; on the other hand, he put forward heavy creative requirements for several large troupes, so that many directors and writers who had not been completely transformed and lacked life experience had to rely on a few political concepts to create plots, resulting in many formulaic works that were anti-realistic and anti-historical. He not only did not criticize these works, but also gave them praise and awards.

Ye Yiqun, Deputy Director of the Film Affairs Administration Office of the East China Culture Department, criticized his erroneous thoughts and styles in his article "Resolutely Correcting Mistakes, Improving Work, and Implementing Chairman Mao's Literary and Art Line!" He pointed out that he lacked the ability to distinguish between working-class and non-working-class literary and art thoughts; he had not participated in the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and retained a strong petty-bourgeois ideology, which led to a series of errors in his work that lost his position. For example, during his tenure as the executive editor of the "Novel" monthly magazine, the magazine published many works full of petty-bourgeois thoughts and sentiments, and works depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers from a petty-bourgeois point of view; during his work in the Shanghai Culture Bureau Film Management Office, he easily believed the "economic difficulties" claimed by some private film studios, lowered the requirements for their products in order to "take care" of them, accommodated their erroneous film production policies, and violated Chairman Mao's instruction of "First for the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers." Particularly serious was that during his work in the "Film Literature Research Institute," he basically adopted bourgeois creative methods, replacing life experience with collecting, interviewing materials and adapting existing works, completely neglecting the most basic condition of authors going to the masses and going to the struggle. Under the slogan of "adapting to the needs of private factories" and "winning over petty-bourgeois audiences," the ideological level of film scripts was lowered, allowing the capitalists of private factories to gain ideological leadership over the institute, reducing himself to the ideological level of the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie to serve the petty-bourgeoisie.

Ke Lan criticized his four main errors in leading the Shanghai workers' literary and art work in his article "Checking My Mistakes in Shanghai Workers' Literary and Art Work": First, he did not diligently go deep among the workers and stand on the position of the working class to serve the working class. Instead of starting from the existing level of the workers and patiently and meticulously cultivating the literary and art in the budding stage among the workers and raising these literary and art works in the right direction, he created another set of so-called "workers' literary and art movement" from top to bottom, concentrating workers' literary and art activists and programs and carrying out "demonstration performances" on a large scale, resulting in a workers' literary and art movement that was superficially spectacular, but was actually just a movement for the sake of a movement and a performance for the sake of a performance, which disappeared after the event. Second, in the work of supporting workers' literary and art, he abandoned ideological leadership. Instead of popularizing the workers' things to the workers and raising them in the direction of the workers themselves, he raised the workers to the "height" of the petty-bourgeoisie and even the bourgeoisie. For example, the teaching content of the "Workers' Writing Class" was mainly "technical education," completely neglecting the importance of seriously studying Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. This is because he had a serious purely technical viewpoint that was divorced from politics in his mind, believing that literary and art workers who had received bourgeois and petty-bourgeois education could correctly serve the people with their "technology" without being transformed. Third, he paid attention to ostentation, forming a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste, thinking that the working class had turned over, only a grand scale could show this spirit; thinking that spending more money for the workers was called "working class viewpoint." Fourth, there was a serious subjective and bureaucratic style, not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses and accepting the instructions of the superiors, lacking the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, causing great losses to the work. Ke Lan finally criticized that the reason for these mistakes was that petty-bourgeois individual heroism had developed to a serious degree.

Mi Gu, Chairman of the Shanghai Artists Association, pointed out in his self-criticism that the Shanghai art world has been seriously eroded by bourgeois ideology. Many comrades do not create with an attitude of responsibility to the people, but create "commodities" for profit, and even secretly paint yellow and feudal superstitious works, rushing to produce a large number of crude and shoddy inferior goods day and night, and even copying each other, irresponsibly publishing their works under pseudonyms, and advocating the bad style of "not recognizing the goods after leaving the door." Mi Gu criticized that he not only did not fight against this bourgeois commercialized thinking, but also turned his own works into commodities. He once took the lead in "bargaining" with state-owned publishing houses, and took the lead in adopting the vulgar method of soliciting manuscripts by means of banquets and treating guests. In addition, he also criticized the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Shanghai Artists Association under his leadership over the past three years: First, in creation, they were divorced from the masses and divorced from the real life struggle. Many comic strip authors did not get enough opportunities to go to factories and rural areas, and could only draw materials from newspaper news; sculptors relied solely on a little "technology" and created "great heroic images" closed in the studio; cartoonists questioned whether drawing cartoons required life; and many painters only relied on newspaper editorials and photos of some political figures for "creation." All of this shows that the art workers are indifferent to Chairman Mao's call to "go to the fiery struggle," and under the pretext of being busy with completing political tasks, they are engaged in closed-door work, crude and shoddy work, thus producing many formulaic and conceptualized works. Second, they despised popularization work and adopted a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to comic strips and New Year pictures. Third, they did not carry out serious criticism and self-criticism, so that many fundamental issues in the art world could not be correctly resolved. Mi Gu said that these shortcomings and errors in the Shanghai art work were inseparable from his own ideological and stylistic errors and shortcomings. This is because he "overly exaggerated his 'achievements,' developed a view of fame and profit, and fostered serious individual heroism."

He Luting, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music, said in his article "Checking My Errors in Work and Creation" that before liberation, he had studied at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the predecessor of the institute, for a long time, and had been eroded by bourgeois ideology for a long time, stained with foreign airs, blindly worshiped the West, and had a strong purely technical viewpoint. After arriving in the liberated areas, these thoughts were not completely eliminated, so after returning to school, he still allowed bourgeois thoughts to occupy a dominant position in the school. In terms of teaching content, he maintained the old traditions, seriously divorced from politics and reality. In terms of teaching attitude, there was a serious mercenary view. He turned the superior's call for "steady progress" into peaceful coexistence with bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, not actively mobilizing teachers to strengthen political and ideological study and actively transform themselves, but instead adopted vulgar methods to "take care" of them. In business study, there was also a disconnection between learning and use, and a disconnection between theory and practice. The issue of foreign voices and local voices has been going on in the vocal music department for several years and has not been resolved. They are simply drilling in the circle of technology, not paying attention to accepting national heritage, not paying attention to studying politics, and experiencing the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The same is true in the composition department. They did not clearly put forward the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not make learning the musical language of their own nation one of the important learning tasks of the entire department; they did not pay attention to life experience, did not pay attention to creative practice, and unilaterally moved foreign techniques. He Luting also criticized his errors in creation in the article. Such as purely technical viewpoints, shouting revolutionary slogans with petty-bourgeois feelings; and in terms of accepting national heritage, accepting many things from scholars and petty citizens, making the works weak and carrying negative emotions. He Luting finally put forward four points for future efforts: "First, strengthen political study, recognize our own petty-bourgeois ideological nature, and completely transform ourselves. Second, study Chairman Mao's literary and art thought more deeply, establish the direction of literary and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and implement Chairman Mao's policies into the leadership of the school and our own creation. Third, overcome the tendency of purely technical viewpoints and blindly worshiping the West, and overcome the tendency of being divorced from politics and reality. Go deep into the masses to experience life, and be familiar with the thoughts, feelings, and hobbies of the masses. Seriously study the national forms in music, be familiar with the national musical language, and enable our creations to truly develop in the right direction. Fourth, strengthen the ideological leadership of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music, unite all teachers and students of the institute, and carry out a deep inspection of literary and art thought, so as to improve leadership, transform learning, and transform our school, so that our school can truly become the people's own conservatory of music."

    华东、上海文艺界开展整风学习运动
    文艺领导干部带头进行检讨
    在毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年纪念日的前夕，华东和上海文艺界展开了整风学习运动。这一运动是在文艺工作者分别参加了国营工厂的民主改革运动、土地改革运动、修治淮河工作和“三反”“五反”运动以后，在思想上得到一定启发的基础上进行的。参加这次文艺整风学习的，一般限于政府文艺工作部门（包括电影厂）、文艺团体和艺术专门学校，而把重点放在文艺工作的各级领导干部和专业的创作干部。在五月二十二日召开的学习动员大会上，中共中央华东局宣传部部长、华东军政委员会文化教育委员会主任舒同指出：三年来，华东和上海的文艺工作是有巨大成绩的，但还存有严重的缺点和错误。他强调文艺工作者的思想改造的重要性，号召大家在这次学习中用马克思列宁主义的理论武器展开批评和自我批评，严肃地批判资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，确立以工人阶级思想为唯一的领导思想，以工农兵为主要服务对象的观点。
    会上，上海市人民政府文化局局长、上海市文学艺术界联合会主席夏衍、华东军政委员会文化部副部长黄源、上海电影制片厂厂长、上海联合电影制片厂厂长于伶等都初步检讨了自己三年来的领导工作。夏衍说他在文艺领导工作中的最主要的错误是放松以至放弃了在文艺思想领域中进行阶级斗争的右倾偏向。其主要表现是：在文艺战线上听任非工人阶级思想意识的进攻、侵蚀，不去努力扩大和巩固工人阶级思想的领导地位；听任广大的小资产阶级文艺工作者用非工人阶级思想的文艺来顽强地宣传他们的主张，不努力改造他们的思想；对于私人经营的文化艺术事业，听任他们臃肿地存在、自流地发展，而不去有步骤有计划地进行调查、监督和领导。夏衍并分析了这些错误的思想根源是由于他长期受着资产阶级的思想影响，和劳动人民的联系不够亲密，思想感情没有经过深刻的改造。他说：
    “过去自己所学到的很多都是没有经过实践而为自己所切实掌握的片面的理性知识；在解放以后，对于毛主席和党所规定的各项政策，也没有进行深入的艰苦的学习。因此，在新的情况下……就不能站稳立场，就不善于运用毛主席的思想武器，不善于从阶级分析的观点来观察问题、解决问题。”此外，他检讨自己的严重的自由主义作风，缺乏组织性纪律性，也是造成错误的重要原因之一。
    黄源检讨了自己严重的官僚主义错误，如对于创作活动和工农群众的文化活动漠不关心，却醉心于烦琐事务和对外应酬。他说这些错误的产生是由于他的阶级立场不稳，没有放下“文化人”的架子深入群众；没有认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    于伶指出自己在电影领导工作上，忽视了电影艺术工作者思想改造的必要性，没有大力组织他们投入生活和斗争中去锻炼，助长了某些同志的自满情绪和错误思想。如有些人认为“生活体验固然重要，可是技术更重要”“为工农兵服务重要，而现在的电影观众中，小资产阶级的数量大，也该为他们服务”“美帝国主义影片的思想内容虽然不好，但是‘技巧’和‘演技’还是第一流的，值得学习”等。于伶指出，由于自己残留着小资产阶级思想，对于上述思想错误的严重性认识不够，没有加以应有的批判，对“武训传”电影，也丧失了辨别能力。
    参加整风的文艺工作者经过二十多天的学习，已开始认识了资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想在文艺工作上的危害性，因而比较深切地体会到小资产阶级的文艺工作者改造思想的必要性和迫切性。截至本月十五日止，已有伊兵、叶以群、柯蓝、米谷、贺绿汀等同志陆续在“解放日报”等报刊发表了检讨文章。
    伊兵是华东文化部艺术事业管理处副处长，他在“改正错误，为戏曲艺术的‘推陈出新’而努力”一文中，指出他没有在戏曲改革工作上坚决贯彻“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，放松甚至放弃了思想领导工作，忽视了戏曲工作者思想改造的重要性。对于当时所流行的企图以所谓“在原有基础上提高一步”来代替“推陈出新”的方针，以及企图以“戏曲不应当脱离小市民观众，应以教育小市民为主”的口号来代替“第一是为着工农兵”的方针，竟然采取无原则的容忍态度。伊兵检讨出：由于他在思想作风上的急躁情绪和好大喜功，对艰苦的思想斗争表现畏缩，追求表面上轰轰烈烈的场面。他一方面严重忽视地方戏旧有剧目的整理审定工作，使绝大部分中小型剧场依旧上演未经改革的旧剧；一方面对几个大型剧团提出繁重的创作要求，使许多未经完全改造、缺乏生活经验的编导只好凭借几个政治概念来制造故事情节，产生了许多反现实主义反历史主义的公式主义的作品。对于这些作品，他不但没有批判，反而给以表扬和奖励。
    华东文化部电影事业管理处副处长叶以群在“坚决地改正错误、改进工作，执行毛主席的文艺路线！”一文中检讨了自己的错误思想和作风。指出自己缺乏对于工人阶级和非工人阶级的文艺思想的辨别能力；自己没有参加工农兵群众斗争，身上残留着浓厚的小资产阶级思想，以致在工作中造成一连串的丧失立场的错误。如在任“小说”月刊的执行编辑期间，使该刊出现了不少充满小资产阶级思想和情调的作品，和用小资产阶级观点来描写工农兵的作品；在上海文化局电影管理处工作期间，轻易地相信了某些私营制片厂所说的“经济困难”，为了“照顾”而降低了对于他们的出品的要求，迁就他们错误的制片方针，违背了毛主席“第一是为着工农兵”的指示。特别严重的是在“电影文学研究所”工作期间，基本上是采取了资产阶级性质的创作方法，用征集、采访材料和改编现成作品代替了生活体验，完全忽视了作者到群众中去、到斗争中去的最基本的条件。在“适应私营厂的需要”和
    “争取小市民观众”的口号下，降低了电影剧本的思想水平，让私营厂的资方取得了该所的思想领导权，使自己降低到资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想水平去为小市民服务。
    柯蓝在“检查我在上海工人文艺工作中的错误”一文中检讨自己在领导上海工人文艺工作中，主要错误有四：一、没有勤勤恳恳地深入到工人群众之中，站在工人阶级的立场上，来为工人阶级服务。不是从工人群众现有水平出发，耐心细致地培养工人群众中萌芽状态的文艺，并把这些文艺沿着正确方向提高，而是另外搞一套从上而下的所谓“工人文艺运动”，把工人文艺积极分子和节目集中起来，大规模地搞“观摩演出”等，致使工人文艺运动表面上轰轰烈烈，实际上只是少数人为运动而运动，为演出而演出，过后也就烟消云散。二、在工人文艺的扶植工作上，放弃了思想领导。不是用工人群众的东西向工人群众普及，并沿着工人群众自己的方向去提高，而是把工人提到小资产阶级甚至资产阶级的“高度”上去。如“工人写作班”的教学内容以“技术教育”为主，完全忽视认真学习毛泽东文艺思想的重要性。这是因为自己思想上存在着严重的脱离政治的单纯技术观点，认为受资产阶级、小资产阶级教育的文艺家，没有经过改造，他的“技术”也可正确地为人民服务。三、讲究排场，形成严重的铺张浪费现象，以为工人阶级翻身了，只有排场大，才能表示出这种气魄；以为为工人多花钱，就叫做“工人阶级观点”。四、存在严重的主观主义与官僚主义的作风，不虚心听取群众的意见和接受上级的指示，缺乏批评和自我批评的精神，给工作造成很大的损失。柯蓝最后检讨这些错误的原因是小资产阶级个人英雄主义已经发展到严重的程度。
    上海美术工作者协会主席米谷在他的检讨中指出：上海的美术界已经严重地受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀。不少同志不是以对人民负责的态度进行创作，而是制造以营利为目的的“商品”，甚至暗中偷绘黄色的、封建迷信的作品，日以继夜地赶制大量粗制滥造的劣等货，甚至互相抄袭，不负责任地把自己作品用化名发表，提倡“出门不认货”的恶劣作风。米谷检讨说，他对这种资产阶级商业化思想不但没有进行斗争，而且也曾经把自己的作品变成商品。他曾经带头与公营出版社“讨价还价”，带头采用庸俗的宴会请客的拉稿方式。此外他还检讨了他领导的上海美术工作者协会三年来的工作中的缺点和错误是：一、在创作上脱离群众，脱离现实生活斗争。许多连环画作者没有得到下厂下乡的充分机会，只能从报纸新闻中吸取题材；雕刻工作者单凭着一点“技术”，关闭在工作室里创作“伟大的英雄形象”；漫画工作者对于画漫画是否需要生活发生了疑问；许多画家只凭报纸社论与一些政治人物的照片进行“创作”。所有这些都说明了美术工作者对毛主席的“到火热的斗争中去”的号召是冷淡的，在忙于完成政治任务的藉口下，从事闭门造车、粗制滥造的工作，因此产生了许多公式化概念化的作品。二、轻视普及工作，对连环画和年画，采取不闻不问的官僚主义态度。三、没有展开严肃的批评和自我批评，而使美术界许多原则问题未能得到正确的解决。米谷说，上海美术工作上的这些缺点和错误是和他自己的思想作风上的错误和缺点分不开的。这是因为他“过度夸大了自己的‘成就’，发展了名利观点，滋长了严重的个人英雄主义”的缘故。
    中央音乐学院上海分院院长贺绿汀在“检查我在工作上和创作上的错误”一文中说，解放前，他曾长期在该院前身上海音专学习，长期地被资产阶级的思想意识侵蚀，沾染了满身洋气，盲目崇拜西洋，有很浓厚的单纯技术观点。到解放区后，这些思想未彻底清除，所以回到学校后，仍让资产阶级的思想在该校占统治地位。在教学内容上保持旧的传统，严重地脱离政治，脱离实际。在教学态度上存在着严重的雇佣观点。把上级“稳步前进”的号召变成了和资产阶级、小资产阶级思想和平共居，不积极动员教员们加强政治、思想学习，积极改造自己，反而采用了庸俗的方式去“照顾”他们。在业务学习上也是学与用脱节，理论与实际脱节。洋嗓子和土嗓子的问题在声乐系闹了几年，一直没有得到解决。单纯地在技术的圈子里钻，不重视接受民族遗产，不重视学习政治，体验工农兵的感情。在作曲系也是如此，没有明确地提出为工农兵服务的方向，没有把学习自己民族的音乐语言作为全系重要学习任务之一；不重视生活体验，不重视创作实习，片面地硬搬外国技巧。贺绿汀在文章中还检讨了自己在创作上的错误。如单纯技术观点，用小资产阶级的感情空喊革命口号；以及在接受民族遗产方面，接受了许多士大夫和小市民的东西，使作品软弱无力，带有消极情绪等。贺绿汀最后提出了四点今后努力的方向：“一、加强政治学习，认清自己小资产阶级的思想本质，彻底改造自己。二、更深入学习毛主席文艺思想，树立为工农兵服务的文艺方向，把毛主席的方针贯彻到学校的领导与自己的创作中去。三、克服单纯技术观点与盲目崇拜西洋的倾向，克服脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向。深入群众体验生活，熟悉群众的思想感情与爱好。认真研究音乐方面的民族形式，熟悉民族音乐语言，使自己的创作能真正向正确的道路发展。四、加强对中央音乐学院上海分院的思想领导，团结全院师生，展开深刻的文艺思想检查，以便改进领导，改造学习，改造我们的学校，使我们的学校能真正成为人民自己的音乐学院。”（刘衡）
