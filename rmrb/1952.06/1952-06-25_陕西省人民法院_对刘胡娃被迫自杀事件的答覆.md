    Shaanxi Provincial People's Court
    Reply Regarding the Forced Suicide of Liu Huwa
    To the Editor: After the People's Daily published a criticism on October 11th of last year on page three regarding the delay in divorce proceedings by the Huaxian People's Court of our province, which resulted in the forced suicide of Liu Huwa, our court immediately ordered the Huaxian People's Court to conduct a self-criticism. The self-criticism report stated: The court had led its personnel to discuss the case. Kang Lin, the person responsible for handling the case, made a self-criticism and requested the organization to impose a penalty on him. The other person responsible for the case, the township head Wang Hao, also made a self-criticism and requested the higher authorities to impose a penalty on him. With the approval of the Provincial People's Court, Kang Lin was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, without being taken into custody, and allowed to work with a suspended sentence; Wang Hao was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment, with the provision that if he made significant progress during his sentence, he would be allowed to work with a suspended sentence. The court has complied with the execution. The court has also dealt with other relevant personnel separately.

    陕西省人民法院
    对刘胡娃被迫自杀事件的答覆
    编辑同志：去年十月十一日人民日报第三版刊载对我省华县人民法院拖延离婚案件造成刘胡娃被迫自杀事件的批评后，我院即令华县人民法院作检讨。检讨报告中说：该院曾领导所属人员对该案展开讨论，该案承办人康麟作了检讨，并要求组织给以处分。该案另一责任人乡长王皡也作了检讨，要求上级给以处分。此事继经省人民法院批准，处康麟以有期徒刑一年，不收监执行，带罪工作；处王皡以有期徒刑一年半，在执行期间有显著进步时，改予带罪工作。该院已遵照执行。对其他有关人员，该院也已经分别作了处理。
