The delegation itself demonstrates the policy of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief stipulated by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of our people of all ethnic groups. We must work harder to implement the policy of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief, and gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural construction of all ethnic groups; at the same time, we must be vigilant and strictly guard against the instigation of imperialism and counter-revolutionary elements, and further consolidate the fraternal unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. Following this, Zhang Leshan, head of the Northwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation, spoke. Head Zhang Leshan said that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest have been liberated and have achieved unprecedented unity in history. In the past two years, there has been significant progress and development in politics, economy, and culture. This is all happiness given by Chairman Mao. In the future, we are willing to work under the banner of Chairman Mao to further strengthen the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and to build a better future for us.

The banquet was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.
