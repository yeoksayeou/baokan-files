Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Editor Comrades: The reader's letter published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on May 17 pointed out that the effectiveness of current affairs study among students in Beijing's secondary schools is very poor, which is a fact. The failure to correct these phenomena in a timely manner shows that the bureaucratic work style of our leading cadres is very serious. We have conducted a preliminary review of this and have begun to check the current affairs learning situation in various schools, and put forward opinions and methods to improve this situation. We will soon announce a unified current affairs study system to be implemented in various schools. We hope that the majority of readers will give us valuable opinions at any time so that the current affairs education in our city's secondary schools can play its due role.
    Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Education and Culture

    北京市文教局接受读者批评将公布加强时事学习的制度
    编辑同志：五月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登的读者来信，指出北京市中等学校学生时事学习的效果很不好，这是事实。这些现象未能及时得到纠正，说明我们领导干部的官僚主义作风是很严重的。对此，我们已经进行了初步的检讨，并已开始检查各校时事学习状况，提出改进这种状况的意见和办法。我们即将公布统一的时事学习制度，在各校实行。我们希望广大读者随时给我们提出宝贵的意见，以便使本市中等学校的时事教育发挥其应有的效果。
