National Railway Labor Model Yang Guoliang Shunting Crew
1,460 Days of Safe Operation
Respected Chairman Mao: Under the Party's cultivation and your leadership, our shunting crew has achieved 1,460 days of safe operation without accidents as of May 5th. We have successfully completed 93,582 wagon and 97,478 shunting operations, created a national record of only 20 seconds per wagon in gravity shunting, and won the title of National Railway Model Shunting Crew. The main reason we have achieved these brilliant successes is that all members of the crew have studied advanced Soviet experience and implemented the Li Xikui shunting method. When implementing the Li Xikui shunting method, some workers had conservative ideas, saying, "The Li Xikui shunting method will not work at Baichengzi Station." The Party's education inspired our enthusiasm for promoting advanced methods, broke down this conservative thinking, and changed the old way of working.

In the patriotic production labor competition, we formulated eight systems and four methods, including shift handover inspection meetings and mutual assistance in train marshalling areas, based on specific conditions. This helped us eliminate accidents of all sizes in shunting operations and ensure the safe operation of trains. With the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, our production enthusiasm has become even higher, creating new records in gravity shunting and exceeding various technical indicators set by the bureau: train marshalling time shortened by 68.7% compared to the bureau's standard, train breakup time shortened by 56.2% compared to the bureau's standard, and operation time, transfer time, and car delivery time shortened by 22% to 61% compared to the bureau's standard. Now, in order to welcome "July 1st," we are launching a friendly competition with other shunting crews to exchange advanced experiences. We guarantee to overfulfill the transportation tasks for the second quarter and strive for 1,800 days without accidents to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and shatter all the conspiracies of the American aggressors.
All employees of the Yang Guoliang Shunting Crew, Baichengzi Station, National Railway Labor Model

    全国铁路劳动模范杨国良调车组
    安全作业一千四百六十天
    敬爱的毛主席：我们调车组在党的培养和您的领导下，到五月五日止，四年来已取到了一千四百六十天安全作业无事故的成绩，顺利完成了九万三千五百八十二辆和九万七千四百七十八钩的调车作业法，创造了溜放一钩只用二十秒的全国最高纪录，荣获全国铁路模范调车组的称号。我们所以能获得这些辉煌成就，主要原因是全组同志学习了苏联先进经验，推行了李锡奎调车法。在实行李锡奎调车法时，有的工人有保守思想，说：“李锡奎调车法在白城子车站行不通。”党的教育鼓舞了我们推行先进方法的热情，打破了这种保守思想，改变了老一套的工作方法。
    在爱国主义生产劳动竞赛中，我们根据具体情况，制订了接班检查会议和列车编组区域互助办法等八项制度、四项办法。这就帮助我们在调车作业中消灭了大小事故，保证了列车安全运行。随着“三反”斗争的胜利，我们的生产情绪更形高涨，创造了溜放的新纪录，并超过了局定的各种技术指标：列车编组时间比局定标准缩短百分之六十八点七，列车解体时间比局定标准缩短百分之五十六点二，作业时间、中转时间、取送车时间比局定标准缩短百分之二十二至百分之六十一。现在，为了迎接“七一”，我们向各调车组发起友谊竞赛，彼此交流先进经验。我们保证超额完成第二季度运输任务，争取一千八百天无事故，来支持中国人民志愿军，粉碎美国侵略者的一切阴谋。白城子车站全国铁路劳动模范杨国良调车组全体职工
