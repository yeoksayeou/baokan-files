Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: The representatives attending the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, after visiting the exhibition of crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism in batches on the 22nd, and personally witnessing the ironclad evidence of war criminals of US imperialism spreading various germ-carrying poisonous insects and objects on a large scale in the front and rear of Korea and in Northeast China and Qingdao, have a deeper understanding of the ugly nature of US imperialism. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the plenary meeting adopted a declaration against US imperialism's germ warfare and in support of the world peace and democracy movement. Representatives from major administrative regions, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese spoke at the conference. Representatives from major administrative regions stated that industrialists and businessmen must actively operate on the basis of eliminating the "five poisons" in the future, and together with the people of the whole country, continue to carry out the campaign to resist US aggression and aid Korea with practical actions, and completely smash the germ warfare. Speakers unanimously supported the speech made by Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik on June 18th and 20th at the Security Council, calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons. Bai Tieshi, manager of the Qinhuangdao Private Yishou Medicinal Materials Store and representative of North China, representing the industrial and commercial circles of North China, said: After visiting the exhibition of crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, we deeply realized that US imperialism is completely the enemy of the people of the world. Qu Yujiu, representative of the Northeast region and chairman of the Dandong City Federation of Industry and Commerce, used the facts he personally saw to accuse American planes of spreading bacterial insects in Dandong City more than once, and the fact that the people of Dandong City mobilized to eliminate the poisonous insects. Qu Yujiu said: In February and March of this year, American planes spread a large number of flies, mosquitoes, fleas, spiders, feathers, leaves, etc. carrying germs over Dandong City. At that time, the climate in Dandong City was still very cold, and the ice and snow had not yet melted. This is what I saw with my own eyes. Miao Hainan, representative of Shandong Province and manager of the private Jinan Chengtong Yarn Factory, said: After seeing the exhibition of crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, we have a further understanding of the crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, and increased our hatred for US imperialism. Jing Chunxian, representative of the Northwest region and manager of the Xi'an branch of Shanghai Bank, said: From the various evidences displayed in the exhibition, we have a deeper understanding of the wolfish nature of the American imperialists. After we return to the Northwest, we vow to closely unite industrialists and businessmen on the basis of the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, actively operate under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and take out all our strength to support our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers, and more forcefully strike at the American aggressors. Abudouwufu Ahongbayi, representative of the industrial and commercial circles of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang Province, said: After visiting the exhibition of crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, we felt extremely angry. The various exhibits on display completely confirmed that the American aggressors were the initiators of bacteriological warfare, and the ironclad facts cannot be denied. Abudouwufu Ahongbayi also said: After we return to Xinjiang, we will definitely promote all Uyghur industrialists and businessmen to improve management, increase production, deepen the campaign to resist US aggression and aid Korea, be vigilant against the rumors and sabotage of US-Chiang agents, sow discord, and further consolidate the unity of all ethnic groups. Rong Yiren, representative of the East China region, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and general manager of the Shenxin Cotton Mill, said: After seeing the exhibition, we further realized the so-called "humanity" of the American imperialists and the "civilization" they boasted about. In order to maintain and consolidate lasting world peace, and to ensure the economic prosperity of our country and the interests of our industrialists and businessmen, we must solemnly protest against the inhuman and international law violating crimes of the American aggressors. Huang Changshui, representative of the Central and South China region and chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Union Guild Committee, said: After our Central and South China delegation visited the exhibition of crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, we held a forum, and everyone agreed that this visit further educated us, enabling us to further realize that US imperialism had studied and manufactured bacteria as early as ten years ago, and the evidence of large-scale spreading of bacterial insects in Korea and Northeast China. US imperialism is still trying to deceive the people of the world, but it cannot quibble in the face of these ironclad human and material evidences. Jin Dongbo, a Korean industrial and commercial representative from Northeast China, said: The inhuman spreading of bacteria by US imperialism in Korea and Northeast China cannot save its disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield. Hu Ziang, representative of the Southwest region and chairman of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed anger and protest on behalf of the industrialists and businessmen in the Southwest region against the heinous bacteriological warfare conducted by US imperialism. He said: From the reports of the representatives from the Northeast region, we already know that the evil attempt of the American imperialists to spread bacteria in Northeast China has suffered a decisive defeat, and we are even more convinced that US imperialism will only face final death in the face of opposition from the people of the world. Yi Meihou, a representative of overseas Chinese industrialists and businessmen, said: We overseas Chinese industrial and commercial circles must use practical actions to stop the aggression of US imperialism and defend world peace in the future.
In addition, after visiting the US Imperialist Germ Warfare Exhibition on the 22nd, representatives from industrial and commercial circles in various places immediately issued written opinions to news reporters, expressing anger and protest against the US imperialism's germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China.
