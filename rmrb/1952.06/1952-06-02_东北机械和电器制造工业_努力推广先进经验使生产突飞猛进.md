    The Northeast machinery and electrical manufacturing industry has been vigorously promoting advanced experiences over the past three years, leading to rapid production growth and completely transforming its past backward state.
    Before liberation, the machinery and electrical industries in Northeast China, like other industries, possessed the characteristics of a colonial economy. They could only manufacture some rough parts or install and repair simple machinery. The total output value of the machinery industry accounted for a very small proportion of the total industrial output value. Now, the proportion of the total output value of the machinery and electrical industries has greatly exceeded that before liberation. Moreover, many large and precision machines that could not be manufactured at all before liberation can now be manufactured independently. Among the more than 20 new products recently rewarded by the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department, those belonging to the machinery and electrical systems include: complete sets of 800 kW hydro-turbine generator equipment, 1.5-meter herringbone gear planer, 106 mm precision boring machine, universal milling machine, and 13,800-volt high-voltage generator coils, among others.
    The most important of the many advanced experiences that have emerged and been promoted in the Northeast machinery and electrical manufacturing industry are: high-speed cutting method, rapid cutting method for belt lathes, multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, joint groups, labor division specialization, double-bucket sand molding method, sand molding assembly line method, and "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," among others. The promotion of these advanced experiences has brought about a tremendous transformation in the production of the Northeast machinery and electrical industries.
    Since the winter of 1950, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has held high-speed cutting training classes, training hundreds of workers and technicians with considerable technical capabilities, and forming several promotion teams to go to various factories to promote these methods. This measure has generally increased the cutting efficiency of Soviet-style machine tools from about 10% to over 50%. The Fourth Workshop of Northeast Machine Factory No. 1 and the Wang Zhaoda Workshop of Northeast Machine Factory No. 18 both exceeded their production tasks by 200% last year because they fully implemented high-speed cutting. The promotion of high-speed cutting has greatly stimulated the interest of workers in various factories in studying advanced technologies. During the increase production and practice economy movement last year, workers launched a heated "finding tricks" movement to improve cutting technology and promoted rapid cutting methods on old-style belt lathes, thereby expanding the field of high-speed cutting, breaking down the conservative thinking of employees, and greatly improving equipment efficiency. The multi-tool multi-edge cutting method created by the employees of the new mechanical processing workshop of Northeast Machine Factory No. 6 simplifies the past processing procedures that required several steps into one. Therefore, after the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method is combined with rapid cutting and high-speed cutting methods, the processing efficiency of many parts is increased by more than ten times, and the processing efficiency of individual parts is even increased by sixty times.
    The increased efficiency in the processing departments made it necessary to increase the output and quality of sand-casted parts in order to meet processing needs. The Yang Shouxun double-bucket sand molding method and sand molding assembly line method of Shenyang Farm Implement Factory No. 1 perfectly solved this problem.
    After the production efficiency of machine tools is improved, production imbalances and downtime due to lack of materials will occur if labor organization and production organization are not improved. To solve this problem, the Second Processing Workshop of Northeast Machine Factory No. 1 adopted a rational production organization of "joint groups" with mixed arrangements of various types of work. The "joint group" assigns tasks based on the principles of assigning tasks, machines, and personnel, replacing the past method of assigning tasks purely based on process. In this way, each part becomes a finished product after being processed by the machines of the "joint group." At the same time, because the upper and lower processes of the "joint group" are closely linked, the phenomenon of parts backlog, difficult process transfer, and downtime due to lack of materials is basically overcome and avoided. The "labor division specialization" implemented in the small motor workshop of Electric Factory No. 5 is also a major improvement in the rationalization of production organization. Its main feature is to change the past practice of each person contracting many processes into a scientific division of labor according to the technical proficiency and expertise of workers, and to arrange the processes in chronological order. In this way, labor efficiency and quality are greatly improved, and the rapid improvement of workers' technical level is promoted. After the implementation of labor division specialization, advanced experiences such as high-speed cutting and multi-tool multi-edge cutting have achieved even greater results.
    The promotion of the above-mentioned advanced experiences has greatly improved the production efficiency of certain parts, processes, or projects, but without sound production management, these partial achievements cannot be effectively organized, so that the production efficiency of all products can be correspondingly improved, and the phenomenon of rush production with a loose start and a tight finish every month cannot be overcome. In August of last year, Northeast Machine Factory No. 3 actively learned from the Soviet Union's advanced management methods and tried out "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," which effectively solved this problem. This advanced method is to organically arrange the production processes of material supply, processing, and assembly according to the required production cycle, and to carry out work in conjunction with each other in a certain step; the activities of workers of different types of work are included in a certain plan, so that people do not sit idle, machines do not stop, and parts are not backlogged. After more than eight months of study, the factory is now gradually moving towards balanced and rhythmic production. Therefore, the overall production potential of the factory has been fully utilized. Last year, they produced less than one hundred lathes. After implementing "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," in the first quarter of this year, under the same equipment, workers, and factory buildings as in the past, the number of lathes produced exceeded one hundred, and the quality was greatly improved, completely eliminating third-class products.
    The Northeast Industry Department believes that the emergence of the advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" effectively solves the long-standing problem of unreasonable production management in the Northeast machinery and electrical industries. Vigorously promoting this comprehensive and significant advanced experience will have an extremely important role in improving the production of the machinery and electrical industries and accelerating my country's industrialization. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has made a decision requiring the immediate learning and promotion of this advanced experience in the machinery and electrical industries, and especially requiring that this work be placed in the first place in terms of management and organization of production, and that it be closely combined with the promotion of other advanced experiences at the same time. This will be a powerful guarantee for realizing this year's production increase and economy practice plan.

    东北机械和电器制造工业
    努力推广先进经验使生产突飞猛进
    东北机械、电器制造工业，三年来努力推广先进经验，使生产突飞猛进，完全改变了过去落后的面貌。
    解放前，东北的机械、电器工业和其他工业一样，具备着殖民地经济的特点，只能制造一些粗糙的零件，或安装、修配一些简单的机械；机械工业的生产总值在整个工业生产总值中所占比重很小。现在机械、电器工业不仅生产总值的比重已大大地超过了解放前，而且，解放前根本不能制造的许多大型的和精密的机器，现在都能自己制造了。最近东北人民政府工业部所奖励的二十多种新产品中，属于机械、电工系统的，就有：八百瓩水轮发电机全套设备、一公尺半人字齿轮刨床、一百零六公厘精密摚床、万能铣床和一万三千八百伏特高压发电机线圈等多种。
    东北机械、电器制造工业中所涌现和推广的许多先进经验中最主要的是：高速切削法、皮带车床的快速切削法、多刀多刃切削法、联合小组、劳动分工专业化、翻砂双称造型法和翻砂流水作业法，以及“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”等数种。这些先进经验的推广，使东北的机械、电器工业生产发生了一个巨大的变革。
    东北人民政府工业部自一九五零年冬季起，举办了高速切削训练班，先后培养出数百名有相当技术能力的工人和技术人员，组成若干推广队分赴各厂进行推广。这一措施，使得苏联新式机床的切削效能，由以前只能发挥百分之十左右普遍提高到百分之五十以上。东北机器一厂第四车间和东北机器十八厂王兆达车间，由于全部实行了高速切削，去年都超额百分之二百完成了生产任务。高速切削法的推广，使得各厂工人对于钻研先进技术发生了极大兴趣。去年增产节约运动中，工人们为了提高切削技术，开展了热烈的“找窍门”运动，又在旧式皮带车床上推行了快速切削法，从而扩大了高速切削的领域，打破了职工的保守思想，使设备效能大大发挥。东北机器六厂新厂机械加工车间职工所创造的多刀多刃切削法，把过去需要经过几次的加工过程简化为一次，所以多刀多刃切削法和快速切削法、高速切削法相互结合应用后，许多部件的加工效率就提高了十倍以上，个别部件的加工效率甚至提高了六十倍。
    由于加工部门效率的提高，就必须提高翻砂铸件的产量和质量，才能供应加工的需要。沈阳农具一厂杨守训翻砂双称造型法和翻砂流水作业法完满地解决了这一问题。
    在机床的生产效率提高后，如不改善劳动组织和生产组织，就会发生生产不平衡和停工待料的现象。东北机器一厂第二加工车间为解决这个问题，采用了各工种混编的“联合小组”的合理化的生产组织。“联合小组”是以定任务、定机器、定人员的原则分配任务，代替过去单纯按工序加工分配任务的办法。这样，每个部件经过“联合小组”的机器加工后，都成为部件成品；同时，由于“联合小组”上下工序紧密相连，因而基本上克服和避免了部件积压、工序转动不开和停工待料的现象。电工五厂小型电机车间所实行的“劳动分工专业化”，同样也是生产组织合理化的一个重大改进。它的主要特点是：把过去由每个人包干许多道工序的做法，改为按工人技术熟练程度和特长进行科学的分工，并将工序按先后次序排列起来。这样，就大大地提高了劳动效率和质量，促进了工人技术水平的迅速提高。实行劳动分工专业化以后，高速切削、多刀多刃切削等先进经验，都收到了更大的效果。
    上述各种先进经验的推广，已经大大提高了某些零件、工序或工程的生产效率，但是如果没有健全的生产管理，就不能把这些部分的成果有效地组织起来，使全部产品的生产效率相应地提高，每月生产上前松后紧的突击现象仍然不能克服。东北机器三厂在去年八月积极学习苏联的先进管理方法，试行“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”，有效地解决了这一问题。这个先进方法是：按照应有的生产周期，把材料供应、加工、装配等生产过程加以有机的排列，各按一定的步骤相互结合地进行工作；把不同工种工人的活动都纳入一定的计划之内，使人不窝工、机器不停歇、部件也不积压。经过八个多月的钻研，该厂现已逐步走向均衡的、有节奏的生产。因此，全厂的生产潜力得到了全面的发挥。去年一年中，他们出产的车床不到一百台，实行“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”后，今年第一季度，在和过去相同的设备、工人和厂房等条件下，出产的车床却超过了一百台，并且质量大大提高，全部消灭了三级品。
    东北工业部认为“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验的出现，有效地解决了东北机械、电器工业中长期存在着的生产管理不合理的问题。努力推广这个全面的、具有重要意义的先进经验，对于提高机械、电器工业的生产，加速我国的工业化，将有着极为重大的作用。东北人民政府工业部已作出决定，要求在机械、电器工业中立即学习和推广这一先进经验，特别要求在管理和组织生产方面要把这一工作放在首要地位，密切地结合着其他先进经验同时推广。这将是实现今年的增产节约计划的一个有力保证。            （据新华社讯）
