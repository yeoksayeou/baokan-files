Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, June 17th: The Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement project was successfully completed on June 14th. After 71 days of intense construction, the 133-kilometer-long Jingjiang Dyke, stretching from Zaolingang in Jiangling County to Mabugui in Jianli County, is now much stronger than before; the Jianghan Plain it protects also feels much safer. This dike reinforcement used a total of 43,764 cubic meters of stone and more than 400,130 cubic meters of earth.

    The Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement project mainly included building riprap revetments on the outside of eight dangerous dike sections, including Qijiayuan, Guanyinsi, and Shashi, and adding earth to raise and thicken more than 40 sections of the entire dike. Due to the rapid water flow of the Jingjiang River, the riverbed near the dike on the north bank has been eroded very deeply in many places, even deeper than the riverbed at the mouth of the Wusong River. The dike sections at Qijiayuan and other places were very dangerous. If the floodwaters eroded the dike foot any deeper, these sections would be in danger of collapsing into the floodwaters. Therefore, it was necessary to build riprap revetments, pave stone aprons, and repair groynes. The river outside these dangerous dike sections now has a thick layer of boulders protecting the dike foot. The most dangerous section of the entire dike, Qijiayuan, has had the serious phenomenon of the riverbed being lower than the Wusong River riverbed eliminated after the riprap was laid, reducing the scouring force of the floodwaters on the riverbed.

    This time, earth was added to 42 places on the dike around Shashi and Hao Xue. The dike around Shashi used to have many houses built on it, and the dike base had many broken bricks and tiles, posing many hidden dangers to the dike body. In order to completely eliminate these hidden dangers, the engineering command completely renovated this section of the dike body. Now, the entire Jingjiang Dyke meets the engineering requirements. Even if it encounters floods like those of 1949 again in the future, the dike will still be one meter above the water surface. In this way, the threat of the Jingjiang floods to the three million people and eight million mu of farmland in the Jianghan Plain will be reduced.

    During the Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement project, the vast number of employees showed extremely high patriotic labor enthusiasm, with more than 20,000 workers, civilian laborers, and military laborers rushing to work on the dike every day. Originally, the reinforcement project was scheduled to be completed by the end of May. However, after inspection, some dike sections were found to be not very safe, so more than 2,000 people continued to work for more than ten days, adding an additional 40,000 cubic meters of earth. Many hidden dangers on the dike that had not been discovered in the past were remedied this time. The completion of the reinforcement project in a short period of time is inseparable from the selfless labor enthusiasm of all employees. Especially during the labor competition in May, the work efficiency of the employees increased linearly: initially, each person could carry 0.5 cubic meters of earth within a distance of 200 meters per day, but later the highest rate increased to 3.5 cubic meters. In May, the work efficiency of pushing wheelbarrows also more than doubled. The project used more than 80,000 tons of boulders, sand, and gravel, etc. The stones were all transported from the Yichang area, more than 300 miles away. It took 20 days for the sailboats transporting the stones to make a round trip, but in order to speed up the work, the boatmen shortened the round trip time to only six days. This played a great guarantee role in the reinforcement project.

### 荆江大堤加固工程已在六月十四日完工

    荆江大堤加固工程已在六月十四日完工
    【新华社沙市十七日电】荆江大堤加固工程，已于六月十四日胜利完工。经过七十一天的紧张施工之后，从江陵县枣林岗到监利县麻布拐全长一百三十三公里的荆江大堤已较前坚固多了；在它保护下的江汉平原也感到安全多了。这次大堤加固，共用石四万三千七百六十四公方，土四十万零一千三百多公方。
    荆江大堤的加固工程主要包括在祁家渊、观音寺、沙市等八处危险的堤段外抛石护岸，和在全堤四十多处培土加高加厚。荆江由于水流很急，北岸临堤的许多地方江床被淘得很深，甚至比吴淞口的江床还要深。祁家渊等处的堤段非常危险，如果洪水把堤脚再淘深些，这些堤段就有倒入洪水的危险，为此必须抛石护岸，铺砌石坦和修补矶头。这些危险堤段外的江中，已有厚厚的一层蛮石保护着堤脚。全堤最危险的祁家渊段，抛石后江床低于吴淞口江床的严重现象即告消除，减低了洪水对江床的冲刷力。
    沙市、郝穴一带大堤这次培土的地方共四十二处。沙市一带大堤堤上，原盖有很多房屋，堤基有很多碎砖破瓦，堤身隐患很多。为了彻底消灭隐患，工程指挥部把这段堤身全部翻修了一遍。现在，荆江大堤全部已合乎工程要求的标准，将来即使再遇到和一九四九年一样的洪水，大堤仍能高出水面一公尺。这样，荆江洪水对江汉平原的三百万人民和八百万亩农田的威胁就减轻了。
    荆江大堤加固工程中，广大员工爱国主义劳动热情极高，每天都有工人、民工和军工二万多人上堤突击施工。本来按原订计划加固工程五月底就已完工。后经检查有些堤段还不很安全，所以又由二千多人多修十几天，多培了四万公方土。堤上许多过去没有发现的隐患，这次都得到了补救。加固工程能够在短期内完成，和全体员工的奋不顾身的劳动热情是分不开的。特别在五月的劳动竞赛中，员工们的工作效率直线上升：开始每人每天在二百公尺距离内挑土零点五公方，后来最高的升到三点五公方。五月间，推斗车的工作效率也提高一倍以上。工程所用的蛮石、砂石、器材等重达八万多吨，石头都是从三百多里以外的宜昌一带运来的。运石的帆船往返一次须二十天，但是为了赶工，船工们把往返的时间一直缩短到六天。这对加固工程起了极大的保证作用。
