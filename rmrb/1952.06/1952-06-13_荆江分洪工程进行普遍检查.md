Xinhua News Agency, Shashi, 12th. The reinforcement of the Jingjiang dyke and the first phase of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project are nearing completion. To ensure that the project quality meets the standards, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Headquarters and its affiliated project leading bodies have organized a large number of personnel to conduct a universal inspection of the completed and ongoing projects; and have promptly taken remedial measures for individual substandard projects that have been discovered.

During the construction of the Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, after the education of the "Three-Anti" movement, the vast majority of employees realized that the quality of the project is the key to determining the success or failure of the project. Therefore, all employees worked very seriously, and adopted the method of inspecting while building during the construction process, and corrected some substandard construction phenomena in a timely manner. For example, when pouring concrete, some units simply pursued speed, and coupled with a lack of experience, the mixing ratio of cement to water was not appropriate, and the cement was sometimes too thin and sometimes too thick. In the compaction work, there were also "honeycomb" phenomena in individual places. After timely discovery and education of the construction workers, these problems disappeared.

In order to ensure that the entire project meets the standards, since mid-May, the project command organs have further systematically dispatched a large number of senior technicians to the construction sites to conduct a universal inspection of the projects together with the construction workers; in addition to checking the general project quality, the focus is on conducting a comprehensive assessment from the entire project design principles combined with the current specific construction situation. After careful measurement and in-depth inspection including interviewing the masses, the three surveying teams inspecting the Jingjiang Dyke discovered that there are still many hidden dangers such as badger dens, ant nests, ancient tombs, and brick slag on the dyke around Wancheng and Shashi. In particular, the dyke body around Shashi only has a layer of good soil on the top, and the lower part is mostly broken bricks and tiles, and the dyke quality is very poor. In the inspection of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, it was also found that there was seepage at the joint between the Taipingkou flood diversion gate body and the bank, and the gate foundation was easily eroded. The inspection team also found that the new dyke of Huangtian Lake had collapsed after being built to about ten meters due to incomplete dredging and excessive moisture in the local soil. Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov also provided a lot of help in inspecting the project quality. During his inspection of the construction site, Bukov found that the seepage line of the upstream revetment of the Huangshantou Sluice Gate was too short, and the moisture at the bottom of the gate could not be drained; the right guide dyke of the flood diversion gate was made into an arc shape and could not withstand the impact of floods; especially the lower layer of the foundation of the flood diversion gate was mostly sandy soil, and the original design of the upstream apron had a very small slope, and the gate body was in danger of being washed away by the flood and other serious problems.

Now, according to this universal inspection, the leading organs of each project have quickly taken remedial measures for the defects in the project. The Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement project was originally planned to be more than 340,000 cubic meters of earthwork. After the inspection, all the houses on the damaged dyke section in Shashi were demolished and thoroughly repaired, adding more than 40,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The farmers along the river are also effectively blocking the badger dens and ant nests that have been discovered. A hollow wall has now been added to the Taipingkou flood diversion gate, and the bottom wall of the upstream corner wall has been extended to connect the hollow wall with the upstream concrete revetment, increasing the length of the seepage line and preventing seepage at the joint between the gate and the bank. A 2-meter deep and 4-meter wide anti-scour trench has been added upstream of the flood diversion gate to enhance the safety of the flood diversion gate. The seepage line of the Huangshantou Sluice Gate has also been lengthened, and the rubble in front of the upstream revetment has been changed to a 10-meter wide concrete revetment. At present, the quality of the various projects of the Jingjiang Dyke reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been greatly improved. The Shashi section of the Jingjiang Dyke has changed the bad reputation of the past "tofu-dreg" dyke and has become a new earth dyke. After adding a drainage layer, some of the new dykes in Huangtian Lake have gradually dried up in the past half month. At present, the construction sites are continuing to carry out a comprehensive survey of the project in conjunction with the acceptance work.

    荆江分洪工程进行普遍检查
    【新华社沙市十二日电】荆江大堤加固和第一期荆江分洪工程，即将全面完工。为保证工程质量合乎标准，荆江分洪总指挥部和所属各工程领导机关已组织大批力量，对已完成的各项工程和正做的工程进行普遍检查；并对已发现的个别不合标准的工程迅速设法进行了补救。
    荆堤加固和荆江分洪工程施工中，广大员工经过“三反”运动的教育，都认识到工程质量的好坏是决定工程成功与失败的关键，因此全体员工工作都很认真，施工中采用了一面施工、一面检查的方法，及时纠正了某些建筑工程不合标准的现象。如在浇灌混凝土时，有些单位单纯求快，加之缺乏经验，拌合水泥水灰比例不适当，水泥有稀有浓。在捣固工作中，个别地方也有“蜂窝”现象。经及时发现和对修筑的员工进行教育后，这些毛病就没有了。
    为使整个工程都能合乎标准，五月中旬以来，各工程指挥机关又进一步有计划地派出大批高级技术人员到各工地，和修筑的员工一同对各项工程进行普遍检查；除检查一般工程质量外，更着重的是从整个工程设计原理结合目前具体施工情况进行全面考察。检查荆江大堤的三个测量小组，经过精细测量和访问群众等深入检查，发现了万城、沙市一带的堤上，还有很多獾穴、蚁洞、古墓、砖渣等隐患未消除。特别是沙市一带的堤身，只是上面有一层好土，下面大部为碎砖乱瓦，堤质很坏。荆江分洪工程的检查中，也发现太平口进洪闸闸身和堤岸接头处渗漏，闸基易被侵蚀。检查组还发现黄天湖新堤由于清淤工作不够彻底和当地土的水分过多，作到十公尺左右即有塌陷现象。苏联水利专家布可夫对检查工程质量也有很多帮助。布可夫在视察工地时，发现了黄山头节制闸上游护坦的渗漏线作的太短，闸底水分无法排泄；进洪闸右引堤作成了弓形，经不住洪水冲击；特别是进洪闸闸基下层多为沙土，原设计上游海漫坡度很小，洪水一来，闸身有被冲走的危险等等严重毛病。
    现在各个工程领导机关已根据这次普遍检查，对工程中的缺陷，都迅速设法进行补救。荆江大堤加固工程原计划作三十四万多公方土，检查后已将沙市一段坏堤上的房屋全部拆除，进行了彻底补修，共增加土方四万多公方。沿江农民对发现的獾穴、蚁洞也在作有效堵塞。太平口进洪闸现已增设了一道空心墙，并将上游角墙的底墙引长，使空心墙与上游混凝土护坦相接，增加了渗漏线的长度，防止了闸与堤岸接头处的渗漏。进洪闸上游又改作了二公尺深、四公尺宽的防冲漕，增强了进洪闸的安全。黄山头节制闸的渗漏线也已加长，上游护坦前的块石已改作为十公尺宽的混凝土护坦。目前，荆堤加固和荆江分洪工程的各项工程质量都已大大提高，荆江大堤沙市段已改变了过去“豆腐渣”堤的坏称号，变为新土堤。黄天湖新堤增加了排渗层后半月来有的已渐干固。现在各工地正配合验收工作继续深入展开工程的普查工作。
