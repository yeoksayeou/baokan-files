    Our Crops Grow Strong Even Under Fire
    ——A Collective Farm Close to the Korean Front
    Gong Jiemin
    The news that the Chinese People's Volunteers were helping a certain farm with emergency planting spread throughout many villages close to the front lines. On May Day, the farm's Young Pioneers team, to celebrate their victory, specially picked various fresh flowers from the hillside and formed eye-catching characters on the bulletin board in front of the farm office: "Volunteer Army Uncles Help with Emergency Planting, Contributing 2,000 Workdays, Completing More Than 400,000 Pyeong of Dryland" (180 Pyeong equals one Chinese Mu). The county also presented the Volunteer Army with a silk banner of friendship.
    When I visited this farm, I constantly heard the rumble of artillery fire. The enemy was randomly shelling the area, and planes were buzzing overhead. However, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was not affected. They were in groups of three or five, or seven or eight, distributed along the roadsides and hillsides, some plowing, some sowing seeds, some spreading manure, cheerfully singing Korean folk songs. Sometimes, the enemy's sporadic shelling and bombing damaged the neat rows of fields, and the brave farmers would fill in the bomb craters in the intervals between the shelling, angrily picking up shrapnel and replanting the seeds. As soon as the whistle blew for the end of the workday, the customary shout would ring out from the hillside: "Support the war against America, overcome the threat of artillery fire, and strive for increased production and a bumper harvest!"
    This is a medium-sized village close to the battlefront. The terrain is high, and there is mostly dry land. After the war began, the American aggressors used barbaric methods to destroy this peaceful village, trampling on the achievements of various constructions after land reform. Agricultural production facilities were destroyed, houses were reduced to rubble, land was left barren, and the number of tools and livestock was greatly reduced. Many patriotic farmers were killed, and the farmers had to move to the rear to spend the winter, leaving the area desolate and uninhabited for a long time.
    The heroic Korean people never bowed their heads in the face of these difficulties created by the American aggressors. Whether old people, women, or children, all had a stubborn heart. Seventy-five-year-old plowman Shin Kwang-soon said: "The more fiercely the bandits destroy, the more united we become in our work. The hearts of the Korean people can never be blown away. As long as there is one person and one breath left, we must rebuild our homes." They loved life and labor, and everyone firmly remembered General Kim Il-sung's call: The struggle for food is the struggle for the motherland, and it is also a guarantee for victory on the front lines.
    When the snow on the mountains began to melt, people who had fled to other places returned to their hometowns carrying grain provided by the Chinese People's Volunteers. Displaced refugees from nearby, mobilized by the government, also moved here in groups of three or five, braving the artillery fire to build air-raid shelters night after night. The county, according to the instructions of the province, organized the seventy households that had moved in into a small farm. The farm had a total of 180 men and women, divided into five work teams (subdivided into squads and groups). The guiding body of the farm was the guidance committee, with a chairman, a business instructor, and a statistician. Each team also had personnel specifically responsible for political education. Before work began, the government distributed improved seeds and eight head of cattle, and equipped them with various farm tools. A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, which was responsible for combat support tasks on the second line, heard the news of the establishment of the farm and immediately established a "Helping Agriculture and Emergency Planting Command Post" in the Second Battalion, Sixth Company's garrison, jointly managed by the deputy political instructor and the civil affairs officer, and allocated 200 workdays per day to help the farm. From April 15th, the farm, with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteers, began a regular collective life.
    Whenever the enemy shelled, each group would hear the alarm and calmly and orderly enter the designated anti-artillery area, holding discussions in the shelters, promoting technology, and exchanging experiences. Agitators (propagandists) also seized the time to report on work achievements and read "Labor News." As soon as the shelling stopped, everyone immediately began their tense labor again.
    I carefully observed this changed mountain area. The numerous traces of bullets on the hillside had disappeared. The broken bricks and tiles had also been cleared away. In some places, rows of potatoes and soybeans had been planted, while in others, pak choi grew, and rape flowers bloomed in small yellow blossoms. Wherever it was possible to cultivate, a layer of new soil had been turned over. Everywhere showed the rebirth of this village.
    Farm committee member Kim Young-rin, a forty-year-old Labor Party member, introduced the progress after the start of work. He said: There were many difficulties at the beginning of digging the land. The first was the problem of eating. Each farm household saved the rice distributed by the government and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and every day they let the children who could not participate in labor dig wild vegetables on the hillside, collect starchy tree roots and wild water chestnuts. In this way, the problem of eating was solved. No other difficulty could stop the farmers' determination to resume production. The old idea that there could be no bumper harvest without chemical fertilizers was completely dispelled. Choi Jong-beom, the second team leader, was a model Labor Party member who boldly adopted new farming methods. He led his team to improve soil conditions with natural fertilizers. He mobilized everyone to transport soil from outside, mixed it with burnt soil to make manure, and improve the soil quality. This method was promoted throughout the farm, and the difficulty of not having fertilizer was overcome. Choi Jong-beom also proposed hoeing more, weeding more, and actively pressing green manure, trying everything possible to achieve increased production and a bumper harvest. All the farmers in the team were determined to become the main force on the agricultural production front. In a short time, farmers with unskilled techniques became skilled plowmen. I asked him where he got the courage to overcome difficulties. Choi Jong-beom excitedly replied in broken Chinese: "The government cares about us so much, distributing seeds and farm tools, and also sending special personnel to guide us; the Volunteer Army also saves their own rations to help us. What difficulties can't be overcome?" Park Soon-yi, a forty-nine-year-old female Labor Party member who led a work team to overfulfill 50,000 Pyeong of cultivation tasks, said in her guarantee letter to the guidance committee: "To be a good Korean, you must dedicate everything to the motherland." On May Day, her entire team did not rest and wrote a personal letter to General Kim Il-sung, vowing to follow the example of farmer Shin Won-seop, who had won the Labor Medal.
    Talking about the farmers' enthusiasm for production, Kim Young-rin said: "The farm stipulates that they work eight hours a day and insist on studying and entertainment, but the farmers all disagree, and the Labor Party members took the lead in voluntarily requesting to work ten hours." Then Kim Young-rin explained: "During the Japanese occupation, ordinary people were not allowed to open up mountains, and farmers could not feed themselves. After 'August 15th,' land reform was implemented, and farmers who had lived as tenant farmers for a long time gained land to cultivate themselves. Everyone was so excited! The government also called for opening up mountains and improving water conservancy and irrigation, so agricultural production increased rapidly, averaging more than double the output before liberation. If the American aggressors had not launched the war, everyone's life would have been so happy. So the farmers hate the American aggressors to death. In addition to voluntarily working ten hours, some teams also secretly spread manure and sow seeds in the moonlight, all striving to create new records in agricultural production. Everyone also jointly wrote letters to collective farms in neighboring counties and launched a production competition."
    After the establishment of the new farm, the farmers' collective consciousness gradually strengthened, and they regarded the farm as their own home. Although there were no new farm tools and no tractors were used, the farmers were full of confidence. They said: "We have the confidence to restore the wounds of war, and our crops will grow strong even under fire."
    The chairman of the guidance committee took out a piece of paper from his diary. He smiled and handed it to me: "Look, comrade, this is the farmers' goal." It was written: Strive for increased production and a bumper harvest this year, and in addition to handing over public grain to the state, use personal savings to run a nursery to accommodate orphans whose parents were killed by American bandits. After increasing production next year, open a battlefield elementary school.

    我们的庄稼在炮火下也一样长得壮
    ——紧靠朝鲜前线的一个集体农场
    宫洁民
    志愿军帮助某农场抢种的消息，传遍了紧靠前线的许多农村。五一节那天，农场的少年儿童队为了祝贺他们的胜利，特从山坡上采来各种鲜花，在农场办公室门前的壁报牌上组成了这样引人注目的大字：“志愿军叔叔帮助抢种，出工二千个，完成旱田四十多万坪”（一百八十坪合中国一亩）。郡里还赠给志愿军一面友谊的锦旗。
    我去访问这个农场时，不断地听到轰隆隆的炮声。敌人没有规律地向这儿打着冷炮，飞机也在头上嗡嗡着。可是农民们的生产热情并没受到影响，他们三五个一组，七八个一群，分布在大道边和山坡上，有的扶犁，有的下种、撒粪，愉快地唱着朝鲜民歌。有时，敌人打过来的冷炮和飞机的轰炸，破坏了整齐的田垅，勇敢的农民们就在炮火停息的空隙把弹坑填平，愤怒地拣出弹片，重新下好种。一响起收工的口哨，山坡上就惯例地呼喊起来，“支援祖国战争，战胜炮火威胁，为增产丰收而斗争！”
    这里是紧靠战斗前沿的一个中等村庄。地势较高，多是旱田，战争开始后，美国侵略者用尽野蛮的方法，破坏了这个和平乡村，蹂躏了土地改革后的各种建设成就。农业生产设施被摧毁，房子成了
    一片瓦砾，土地荒芜了，工具畜力大大减少。不少爱国农民被杀害，农民们不得不搬到后方去度过寒冬，使这里长时间变成了荒凉的无人区。
    英雄的朝鲜人民，在美国侵略者制造的这些困难面前始终没有低头。不论老人、妇女和儿童，都有一颗顽强不倔的心。七十五岁的老扶犁员申光纯这样说：“强盗们破坏的越凶，我们干的越齐心。朝鲜人民的心是永远炸不掉的。有一个人，有一口气也得整顿家园。”他们就是这样地热爱生活，热爱劳动，每个人都牢牢记住了金日成将军的号召：为粮食的斗争，就是为祖国的斗争，也是保证前线胜利的斗争。
    山上积雪开始融化的时候，逃往外乡的人们就背着志愿军救济的粮食奔回故乡。附近流离失所的难民，经政府发动，也三五成群地搬到这里，冒着炮火连夜筑起一个个的防空洞。郡里按着道的指示，把搬来的七十户农民组织起来成立了一个小型农场。全场共有男女一百八十人，分作五个作业小队（以下设班、组）。指导农场的总指挥部是指导委员会，有委员长、业务指导员和统计员各一人。小队还有专门负责政治教育的人员。开工前，政府发下了优良的籽种和八条耕牛，并配备了各种农具。在二线担负战勤任务的志愿军某部听到成立了农场的消息，马上在二营六连驻地成立了“助农抢种指挥部”，由副教导员和民运干事共同掌握，每天拨出二百工帮助农场工作。从四月十五号起，农场在志愿军的帮助下，开始了有规律的集体生活。
    每逢敌人打炮时，各组听到警报，即沉着地有秩序地进入指定的防炮区，在隐蔽部展开漫谈，推广技术、交流经验。煽动员（宣传员）也抓紧时间报告工作成绩，读“劳动新闻”。炮声一停，大家马上又开始紧张的劳动。
    我仔细地观察了这个变了样的山野。山坡上累累的弹痕已经消失。残砖破瓦也收拾完了。有的地方种上了一垅垅的马铃薯和大豆，有的则长起了小白菜，油菜开了小黄花。只要是能耕种的地方，都翻起了一层新土。处处显示着这个村庄的新生。
    农场委员金荣潾，是个四十岁的劳动党员，他介绍着开工后的经过。他说：开始刨地时碰到了不少困难。首先是吃饭问题。每个农户把所分到的政府和志愿军救济的大米省吃俭用，每天让不能参加劳动的孩子们在山坡挖野菜、采集带有淀粉质的树根和野荸荠。这样一来，吃饭的问题解决了。其他任何困难，也没有阻止住农民们恢复生产的决心。过去认为没有化学肥料就不能丰产的陈旧思想完全打消了。作业第二班崔钟范就是大胆采用新的耕作方法的一个模范劳动党员。他领导他的作业组用天然肥料来改善土壤条件。他发动大家从外边运土，掺合上烧土制成粪，来提高土质。这个方法在全场作了推广，没有肥料的困难又被克服了。崔钟范还提出多下锄、多拔草、积极压绿肥，想尽一切办法来达到增产丰收。全组农民下决心要成为农业生产战线上的主力军。在很短的时间内，技术生疏的农民就成了熟练的扶犁手。我问他克服困难的这种勇气是那来的，崔钟范很激动地用不熟练的中国话回答：“政府这样关心我们，发给籽种和农具，还派专人来指导；志愿军也节省自己的口粮来救济，还有什么克服不了的困难呢？”领导一个作业组超额完成了五万坪的耕作任务的朴顺伊，是个四十九岁的女劳动党员，在她写给指导委员会的保证书上说：“要想作个很好的朝鲜人，就必须把个人一切献给祖国。”五一节那天，她们全组没休工，并向金日成将军写了亲笔信，立誓要向荣获劳动勋章的农民申元燮看齐。
    谈起农民们的生产热情，金荣潾说：“场里规定每天劳作八小时，坚持学习和娱乐，农民们全不同意，以劳动党员为首自动要求劳作十小时”。随后金荣潾解释说：“日本鬼子统治时代，不许老百姓开山，农民粮食不能自给。‘八一五’以后实行了土地改革，长期过着佃农生活的农民，获得了自己耕种的土地。大家多么兴奋！政府又号召开山，改善水利灌溉，因此农产量提高很快，平均超过了解放前产量二倍多。假如美国侵略者不发动战争，大家的生活是多么幸福。所以农民们恨死了美国侵略者，他们除了自愿十小时劳作外，有的小组还偷偷地在月光下撒粪下种，都为创造农产上的新纪录而努力。大家并联名向邻郡的集体农场写了信，发起了生产竞赛。”
    新的农场成立以后，农民们的集体观念逐步加强了，他们把农场看成自己的家。虽然没有新式农具，没有使用拖拉机，但农民们充满了信心。他们说：“我们有信心恢复战争的创伤，我们的庄稼在炮火下也一样长得壮。”
    指导委员会委员长从日记本里取出一个纸条，他笑着递给我：“看吧，同志，这是农民们的奋斗目标。”上边写的是：力争今年的增产丰收，除了交国家的公粮外，拿个人节余办一个托儿所，收容被美国强盗杀死了父母的孤儿，明年增产后，再开办一个战地小学校。
