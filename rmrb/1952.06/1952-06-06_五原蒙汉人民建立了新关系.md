    New Relationship Established Between Mongolian and Han People in Wuyuan

    Comrade Editor: Wuyuan County in Suiyuan Province is a region where Mongolian and Han people live together. The Han people engage in agriculture, and the Mongolian people engage in animal husbandry. The Mongolian people often drive their cattle and sheep to the mountains to graze in the morning and drive them back in the evening. There are many canals in this area, and when the ice melts in the spring, the canal banks are covered in mud. When cattle and sheep go to the canals to drink water, they often get stuck in the mud. One evening, as we, a group of canal-digging laborers, were cooking, we suddenly heard a Mongolian villager shout, "Han folks, a cow is stuck over there!" We said in unison, "Let's go save the Mongolian fellow's cow." We took large ropes and levers, waded through the cold canal water, and went to the place where the cow was stuck. The cow was struggling in the mud. Some of us lifted, some of us pulled, and finally we got the cow out. The Mongolian villager was very grateful to us. This year, during the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations, local Mongolian women spontaneously organized themselves, bringing eggs and milk to comfort us canal-digging laborers. Both sides were filled with feelings of mutual affection. This is a new relationship between the Mongolian and Han nationalities under the shining light of Chairman Mao's great national policy.

    五原蒙汉人民建立了新关系
    编辑同志：绥远省五原县一带，是蒙汉人民杂居的地区。汉民从事农业，蒙民从事畜牧，蒙民常常在早晨把牛羊赶到山上放牧，到晚上再赶回来。这一带渠道比较多，春天化冰时，渠边一片稀泥；牛羊到渠中饮水，常常陷在泥中。一天傍晚，我们这批挖渠的民工正在做饭，忽然听到一个蒙族老乡喊道：“汉老乡，那边陷住牛了！”我们不约而同地说：“走，去救蒙老乡的牛。”我们拿着大绳、杠子，涉过冰冷的渠水，走到陷牛的地方。那头牛正在稀泥里挣扎。我们抬的抬、拉的拉，终于把牛救了出来。蒙族老乡很感激我们。今年“五一”劳动节时，当地蒙族妇女自动组织起来，带着鸡蛋、牛乳，来慰劳我们挖渠的民工。双方充满着互相亲爱的感情。这是毛主席伟大的民族政策照耀下的蒙汉民族间的新关系。　赵曼云
