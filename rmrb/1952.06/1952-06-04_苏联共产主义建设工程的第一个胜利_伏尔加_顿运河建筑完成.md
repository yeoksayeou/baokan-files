    The First Victory of the Soviet Union's Communist Construction Project
    Completion of the Volga-Don Canal
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd] The Soviet people have achieved the first victory in the communist construction project. The Volga-Don Canal, stretching 101 kilometers from near Stalingrad on the Volga River to Kalach-na-Donu on the Don River, has been completed. The waters of the Don and Volga Rivers met on May 31st. As the rivers merged to the solemn melody of the Soviet national anthem, the thousands of working people gathered at the confluence cheered, their voices resounding across the banks.
    The canal began its trial voyage on the 1st. Two tugboats towing barges and a dredger had already entered the first lock chamber from the Volga side, and they will travel along the canal, passing through the nine locks on the Volga side upstream. Recently, large steamers loaded with timber and new-style iron barges with a capacity of 3,000 tons have arrived at Stalingrad, the starting point of the canal, ready to travel through this new canal. The goods carried by these ships include tens of thousands of cubic meters of building materials and other materials destined for the Donets Coal Region, the Sea of Azov and Black Sea coastal areas, and the North Caucasus. Ships loaded with coal and grain will travel along the canal in the opposite direction and up the Volga River to the central regions. In addition to cargo ships, passenger ships will also begin operating on the canal this month.
    At the other major construction site of the canal project—the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Complex area—all installations are nearing completion. Sailing vessels will soon be able to travel from Stalingrad, through the Volga-Don Canal, and then through the world's largest artificial reservoir, the "Tsimlyansk Sea," to Rostov on the lower Don. Several steamers have already been launched in the "Tsimlyansk Sea," and more than 50 buoys and cylindrical buoys have been moored along more than 50 kilometers of waterways in the "Sea." A dam and two navigation locks from the "Tsimlyansk Sea" to the lower Don River have also been completed. Now workers have begun the work of straightening the Don River channel. Powerful dredgers are removing millions of cubic meters of earth every day.

    苏联共产主义建设工程的第一个胜利
    伏尔加—顿运河建筑完成
    【新华社三日讯】苏联人民在共产主义建设工程中已获得第一个胜利，从伏尔加河畔的斯大林格勒附近到顿河畔的卡拉奇镇的长达一百零一公里的伏尔加—顿运河已建筑完成。顿河河水和伏尔加河河水已在五月三十一日会合。当河水在苏联国歌庄严的旋律中会合时，集合在会合地点的成千上万的劳动人民，夹岸欢呼，响彻云霄。
    运河于一日开始试航，两艘拖轮拖着趸船和一艘挖泥船，已从伏尔加河这一端驶入第一号水闸闸舱，它们将沿着运河，穿过伏尔加河这一边的九道水闸溯水而上。最近装载着木材的大汽船和容量三千吨的新式铁驳都已开到运河起点斯大林格勒，准备驶过这条新运河。这些船只所装的货物包括运往顿尼兹煤区、亚速海及黑海沿岸地区和北高加索的数万立方公尺的建筑材料和其他材料。装载煤炭与谷物的船只将从相反的方向沿着这条运河并且溯伏尔加河开到中部地区去。除了货船之外，客船也将在本月间开始在运河航行。
    在运河工程另一主要工地——齐姆良水利工程地带，一切装置都已接近落成。航行船只不久就可以从斯大林格勒，经过伏尔加—顿运河，再经过世界上最大的人工水库“齐姆良海”，驶往顿河下流的罗斯多夫。“齐姆良海”上，已有若干汽船下水，“海”中五十多公里的水路已碇泊了五十多个浮标和圆柱浮标。从“齐姆良海”到顿河下流的一条水坝和两道通航水闸，也已全部完成。现在工人们已开始进行顿河河道取直的工作。强大的挖泥机正在一天天地移去数以百万公方计的泥土。
