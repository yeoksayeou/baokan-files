Hebei Shexian Cooperative Union
Self-Criticism Regarding the Sale of Moldy Cottonseed

To the Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on May 16th published a reader's letter pointing out that our cooperative should not have sold moldy Si Zi cottonseed to the North Danche Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Fourth District of Pingshun County, Shanxi. After our investigation, we believe that the reader's claim is entirely factual. Last year, our county suffered from a cotton disaster, resulting in a large amount of frost-affected cotton, and the quality of both the cotton and cottonseed was not good. Furthermore, due to poor storage after the purchase, the cottonseed was piled up in the warehouse after processing and never turned or dried, causing a large amount of it to become moldy. When selling the cottonseed this year, our cooperative did not conduct any tests and sold the bad cottonseed, causing losses to cotton farmers in North Danche and other villages in Pingshun, and affecting their plans for increased production this year. This incident shows that there is a serious bureaucratic style of work on the part of our cooperative's leadership, a lack of concern for the patriotic production increase movement, and a lack of responsible attitude towards state property. Now, in addition to learning from this lesson and requesting punishment from higher authorities, our cooperative has sent personnel to the Fourth District Government of Pingshun County to apologize to all cotton farmers.

                    Yang Tingran, Director of the Shexian Cooperative Union of Hebei Province

    河北涉县合作社联合社
    关于出卖霉烂棉籽的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十六日“读者来信”栏登载了读者来信，指出我社不应该把霉烂的斯字棉籽卖给山西平顺县四区北耽车村供销合作社。我们检查以后，认为读者指出的完全是事实。去年我县棉花受灾，有大批霜后棉，棉花、棉籽质量都不很好；再加收购来保管不好，加工后即堆在仓库中，从未翻晒，致使大批棉籽霉烂了。到今年售棉籽时，我社没有试验，就把这些坏棉籽卖出，使平顺北耽车等村棉农受了损失，影响了他们今年的丰产计划。从这一事件，说明我社领导方面存在着严重的官僚主义作风，对爱国丰产运动漠不关心，对国家资财缺乏负责的态度。现在我社除接受这一教训，并向上级请求处分外，已派员到平顺县四区政府给全体棉农道歉。
