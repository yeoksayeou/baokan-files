A Compilation of Readers' Letters:

    Seriously Irresponsible Work Style Among Medical Personnel Must Be Overcome

    From mid-March to mid-June, our newspaper received 127 letters from readers exposing medical workers' disregard for human life. To draw the attention of medical leadership and alert medical workers, we are publishing excerpts from these letters as follows:

    Reader Zhao Shimao wrote: "The Haidian United Clinic in Beijing has a sign that reads 'Emergency visits are available at any time,' but when people request treatment for emergency illnesses at night, the clinic refuses to treat them, claiming, 'There are no doctors here at night.'" Another reader reported: "On the night of March 18th, a woman developed acute appendicitis and went to Beijing Third Hospital to request surgery. After diagnosis, Dr. Xing of the hospital determined that surgery should be performed immediately. However, he then said, 'Our hospital is full, please seek treatment elsewhere.' He also told the patient's family, 'Yesterday, there was a child with a festering abdomen whose intestines were protruding, a much more serious condition than yours, but we still couldn't admit him due to lack of beds.' The patient's family asked him to check if there were indeed no beds. He said, 'I don't know about other departments, but the surgery department definitely has no beds.' A worker nearby couldn't stand it and said bluntly, 'The ENT department has beds.' Dr. Xing replied, 'Only the president can allocate those. It's late at night, and I can't negotiate with other departments.' The patient asked him to call the president for instructions. He said, 'I don't know the phone number.' The patient's family dialed the number themselves, and the president said on the phone, 'To treat emergency illnesses, we should of course admit the patient as long as there are beds available in the hospital.' Only then did Dr. Xing reluctantly send the patient to an empty bed in the obstetrics and gynecology department. The next morning, the patient was moved back to the surgery department. According to patients in the same room, the bed had been empty for several days."

    The combination of some medical workers' refusal to provide care and their departmentalism is even more egregious. On February 24th, a comrade from the Central Youth League School suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. Comrades discovered this situation at 8 a.m., and the patient was already on the verge of death. They immediately sent the patient to the Jiaotong Hospital, only a few steps away from the school, to request emergency treatment. However, the person in charge of the hospital refused to see them and had a messenger inform them that their hospital was an institutional hospital, and since the Youth League School was not part of their system, they could not provide treatment. By the time a doctor from the Third Outpatient Department arrived, the comrade was beyond saving.

    All teachers and staff of the Lianziku Primary School in the Fifth District of Beijing wrote: "Jin Xiufen, a fifth-grade student at our school, suffered from acute mastoiditis and was sent to Peking University Hospital for treatment. After diagnosis, the doctor determined that the condition was serious and surgery was necessary. However, according to the hospital's regulations, the student could only be admitted for surgery after paying more than 8 million yuan in fees. The student's family was poor and did not have that much cash on hand immediately. They repeatedly pleaded with the hospital to admit and treat the patient first, promising to pay the full amount that day. However, the hospital's admissions office insisted on refusing admission. The patient's family raised the money by 10 p.m. that night and sent the patient back to the hospital. The hospital did not seize the time to treat the patient and delayed until 3 a.m. the next morning when the doctor said that the patient's bone marrow had changed color, the condition was serious, and they were preparing to perform surgery. For some reason, the doctor changed his mind again and wanted to wait until 8 or 9 a.m. to perform the surgery. However, an hour later, the patient died." According to readers' letters, this phenomenon has also occurred at the North China People's Hospital and the Second Hospital of Beijing.

    The Women's Federation of the Eleventh District of Beijing wrote that Wu Ren, a resident of the district, suffered from postpartum psychosis and went to the First Hospital of Beijing for treatment. The obstetrician and gynecologist at the hospital did not conduct a detailed examination and said that it was an internal medicine problem, pushing the patient to the internal medicine department for treatment. The patient stayed in the internal medicine ward for five days without anyone taking care of her. Finally, after it was determined to be postpartum psychosis, she was transferred back to the obstetrics and gynecology department. Because the treatment period was missed, the patient's life could not be saved. A doctor at the Third Hospital of Beijing once removed half of a patient's anal sphincter, mistaking it for a hemorrhoid. As a result, the patient's excretory organs became dysfunctional, causing him great pain and discomfort. The patient reported this situation to the hospital. Not only did the hospital doctor not admit the mistake, but he also deceived the patient, saying, "Because your body is weak, we will give you injections and medication, and you will gradually get better." The patient was treated in the hospital for more than two years, but still did not get well. Female worker Chen Guoying suffered from a gluteal abscess and received a notice from the Second Hospital of Beijing to undergo surgery on January 21st. The nurse in the operating room did not look at the medical record and administered tissue therapy. Chen Guoying asked, "Have I been given someone else's surgery? Is it dangerous?" The nurse said calmly, "It doesn't matter! It won't harm your body."

    Reader Gu Yuxiu wrote about the nursing situation at Beijing Tongren Hospital, saying: "Some nurses are completely indifferent to patients and express boredom with their work, so they have given the wrong medication more than once." Reader Gao Xing wrote: "On March 20th, a resident holding a baby went to the First Hospital of Beijing to see a doctor. After registering, they waited for four hours, but their number was still not called. Seeing that the child's condition was getting worse, they found a nurse and asked her to check if their number had been called. The nurse replied, 'We are very busy here, who has time to check for you!' The person had to continue waiting. By the time it was after 1 p.m., the child had died. When they went to find the nurse again, holding the dead child, the nurse said, 'We called you several times, who told you not to listen! Can you blame us because the child died?'"

    Meng Yuquan from Shibalidian, Beijing, wrote that although the Zuo'anmen Clinic in Beijing claims to "face the countryside," it does not actually take into account the difficulties of the masses. More than 20 patients went to the clinic at 6 a.m. on March 28th, but Director Yang of the clinic did not see them until 4 p.m. According to readers, the situation of doctors not coming to work on time is very common.

    After the general public reported the situation of medical workers' serious irresponsibility leading to medical accidents, they unanimously requested that medical workers strengthen ideological reform, establish a viewpoint of serving the people, promote revolutionary humanitarianism, and help the people relieve the pain of illness.

### 医务人员中严重的不负责任的作风必须克服

专栏：读者来信综述

    医务人员中严重的不负责任的作风必须克服
    本报从三月中旬到六月中旬，陆续收到揭发医务工作者草菅人命的读者来信一百二十七件。为引起医务领导机关的注意和医务工作者的警惕，特将这些来信摘要发表如下：
    读者赵叔茂来信说：北京海甸联合诊所的门前贴着“急病随时出诊”的告示，但群众在夜间请该诊所治疗急病的时候，该诊所竟以“此处夜间没有大夫”为词，拒绝给群众治病。另一位读者反映：三月十八日夜间，有个妇女得了急性盲肠炎，到北京市第三医院要求割治。该院邢大夫诊断后，认为应该立即施行手术；但跟着就说：“本院病床已满，请到别处治疗。”他还对病人的家属说：“昨天有一个小孩，腹部溃烂，肠子都流出来了，比你这病严重得多，因为没有床位，仍旧不能收容。”病人的家属请他查查是否的确没有床位。他说：“别的科我不知道，外科确实没有床位。”旁边有位工友看不过去，直率地说：“耳鼻喉科有床位。”邢大夫却说：“那只有院长才能分配。深更半夜，我不能向别科交涉。”病人要求他打电话请示院长。他说：“不知道电话号码。”病人的家属自己打通了电话，院长在电话里说：“为了救治急病，只要本院有床位，当然应该收容。”邢大夫这才勉强把病人送到妇产科的空床位上。第二天早晨，又将病人搬回外科去了。据同房间的病人说：这张床已经空了几天了。
    某些医务工作者见死不救的作风和本位主义思想结合起来，其性质就更恶劣了。二月二十四日，中央团校有位同志中了煤毒。同志们在早晨八时发现这种情况，患者已经奄奄一息了。同志们马上把病人送到距离该校仅几十步远的交通医院，请该院进行急救。但该院负责同志拒不接见，并由传达同志通知说：他们这个医院是机关医院，团校不属于他们的系统，所以不能医治。等到第三门诊部派来医生时，这位同志已经无法挽救了。
    北京市五区帘子库小学全体教职员来信说：该校五年级学生金秀芬患急性乳突炎，送北大医院医治。经医生诊断，病情严重，必须施行手术。但根据该院规定，只有交清了八十多万元的费用，才能住院动手术。该生家庭清寒，一时没有这许多现款，一再请求院方先把病人收下诊治，并保证当天将款交齐。但该院住院处坚持不收。病人家属在当晚十时把款筹齐，又将病人送到该院。该院并不抓紧时间诊治，一直拖到第二天早晨三时，医生才说病人骨髓变色，病情严重，准备施行手术。不知为什么，医生又变卦了，要等到八、九点钟再作手术。但是一个小时后，病人就死了。据读者来信反映，这种现象在华北人民医院及北京市第二医院也发生过。
    北京市第十一区妇联会来信说，该区吴任氏得了产后疯，到北京市第一医院医治。该院妇产科大夫没有详加检查，就说这是内科病，把病人推给内科治疗。病人在内科病房住了五天，没有人照顾。最后经查明是产后疯，才又转到妇产科。因为错过诊治时期，患者的生命已经无法挽救了。北京市第三医院某大夫曾将一个病人的肛门括约肌当作痔核割去一半，这个病人的排泄器官的机能因此失效，他行坐不安，极为痛苦。病人向该院反映了这种情况，该院大夫不但不承认错误，还欺骗病人说：“因为你身体弱，给你打打针，上点药，慢慢就会好的。”病人在该院治了二年多，还是没有治好。女工陈国英患臀部浓疡，接到北京市立第二医院通知，在一月二十一日去动手术。手术室的护士同志不看病历，就实行组织疗法。陈国英问：“别人的手术给我搞上了，有危险没有？”护士很安然地说：“没关系！对你身体没坏处。”
    读者顾玉琇来信反映北京同仁医院的护理情况说：有些护士对病人毫不关心，对工作表示厌倦，因此不止一次地送错了药。读者高兴同志来信说：三月二十日，有个居民抱着婴儿到北京市第一医院看病，挂号后等了四个钟头，还没有叫到他的号数。眼看孩子的病更重了。他找到护士，请她查一下，是否叫过了。护士回答说：“我们这里很忙，谁有工夫给你查！”这个人只好再等下去，直等到下午一点多钟，他的孩子已经死了。他再抱着孩子去找护士时，护士说：“我们已经叫过你好几遍了，谁叫你自己不听呀！孩子死了还能赖我们吗？”
    北京十八里店孟玉泉来信说，北京左安门诊疗所虽说“面向农村”，但实际上并不照顾群众的困难。二十多个病人在三月二十八日早晨六点钟到该所看病，直到下午四点，该所杨所长才来看病。据读者反映，医生不按时上班的情形非常普遍。
    广大读者反映了医务工作者严重地不负责任以致造成医疗事故的情况后，一致要求医务工作者加强思想改造，树立为人民服务的观点，发扬革命的人道主义精神，帮助人民解除疾病的痛苦。
