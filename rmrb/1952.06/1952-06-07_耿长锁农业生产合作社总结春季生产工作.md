    The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang, Hebei, which launched a nationwide production increase competition among farmers, has completed its spring plowing and sowing work on time. During the spring plowing and sowing, the cooperative experienced some problems: the cooperative's super high-yield land was not fertilized with fine fertilizer during spring plowing; the high-yield cotton was not well processed after sowing, resulting in incomplete seedling emergence; the corn was planted too sparsely, destroyed, and replanted, delaying the sowing period. On May 7th and 8th, they convened a meeting of cooperative members, summarized the spring production work, reviewed the serious shortcomings in the spring plowing and sowing work, criticized the complacency and dependence of some cooperative members, and decided to establish a production increase committee to strengthen leadership, overcome shortcomings, and achieve the production increase competition plan.

    The leading cadres of the cooperative, in their self-criticism, believed that the reason for these shortcomings in spring plowing and sowing was mainly due to the lack of thorough planning on the part of the leadership, and the failure to mobilize the strength of all cooperative members. Some matters were handled solely by the director and the production team leaders. Wei Lianyu, the deputy director of the cooperative, said: "After issuing the challenge to the whole country, I was so afraid of not completing the plan that I couldn't even sleep well. However, I didn't discuss matters with everyone, which resulted in many problems. For example, during the spring plowing, I knew that fine fertilizer should be applied, but I didn't tell everyone, so everyone didn't apply it when plowing the land. This is a considerable loss. If we continue like this, our production increase plan will fail." The cooperative members also believed that the leadership had not made good use of everyone's strength; at the same time, they criticized their own complacency and dependence. Some cooperative members said: Seeing that the cooperative had nine mules and horses, sixty full and semi-laborers, increased by forty-six mu of paddy fields, had more than ten thousand catties of fine fertilizer, and a dozen pigs, they thought that the production increase was very promising, and they no longer actively tried to guarantee the production increase. Cooperative member Zhang Jinren said: "In the past, I relied solely on the leading cadres, but now I understand that this is not right. As the saying goes, 'Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang.' Increasing production cannot rely solely on the director and the team leaders; the opinions of the majority are always better than those of one or two people." After such a self-criticism, everyone's thinking was further enhanced, and they all started to use their brains to study improvement methods. Lu Molin said: "This year, in my opinion, we must rely on everyone to come up with ideas to carry out the production increase competition; we can set up a production increase committee to lead the whole cooperative to carry out the production increase competition." Everyone agreed with this suggestion. They elected Li Yantian and Wei Lianyu as the director and deputy director of the production increase committee, and also elected ten people as members. The committee has four production increase groups under it: cotton, grain, corn, and sweet potato; according to each person's expertise, four people were selected to serve as team leaders, and all sixty full and semi-laborers in the cooperative were assigned to each group. These groups are responsible for managing all kinds of super high-yield land, and also manage general production increase land. They want to apply the experience of managing super high-yield land to general production increase land, so that all land can increase production. The division of labor among cooperative members is not mechanical. If something urgent needs to be done, the forces will be concentrated on doing it first, and the production increase committee will uniformly allocate and mobilize the workforce. In order to strengthen leadership, the production increase committee will hold a meeting every night to report on the production situation of the day and plan the work for the next day. Production team meetings will also be held twice every ten days to study the implementation of the production plan and conduct patriotic education.

    After doing this, the leadership of the cooperative was strengthened. Leaders discuss matters with the cooperative members; the cooperative members' awareness has also been further enhanced. Striving for the victory of the production increase competition has become a unified action of all cooperative members. They seized the time to complete the replanting of seedlings, actively carried out seedling protection, and made more specific plans for drought resistance and pest control.

    耿长锁农业生产合作社总结春季生产工作
    向全国农民发起全面增产竞赛的河北饶阳耿长锁农业生产合作社，已按时完成了春耕播种工作。该社在春耕播种工作中，曾经发生了一些问题：全社的超额丰产地，在春耕时没有施细肥；丰产棉播种后没有很好地加工，结果没有出全苗；玉米种得太稀，毁了又种，推迟了播种期。五月七、八两日，他们召开了社员大会，总结了春季生产工作，检讨了春耕播种工作的严重缺点，批判了社员中存在的自满情绪和依赖思想，并决定成立增产委员会，以便加强领导，克服缺点，实现增产竞赛计划。
    该社的领导干部在检讨时认为：春耕播种中发生这些缺点的原因，主要是领导方面缺乏周密的计划，而且没有把全体社员的力量发动起来，有些事情被主任和各生产组长包办了。合作社副主任魏连玉说：“向全国提出挑战以后，我光怕完不成计划，连觉都睡不好；可是有事没跟大家商量，结果就出了不少岔子。像春耕时，我是知道要施细肥的，可是没和大家说，耕地时大家就没有施。这个损失真不小。以后再这样，我们的增产计划就会落空。”社员们也认为领导方面没有很好地发挥大家的力量；同时批判了本身存在的自满情绪和依赖思想。有的社员说：看到社里有九个骡马，六十个整半劳动力，增加了四十六亩水田，有一万多斤细肥，十几口猪，就认为增产很有把握，再没有积极想办法保证增产。社员张近仁说：“以前我光依靠领导干部，现在明白了这样不对。常言说，‘三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮’。增产光靠主任、组长不行；多数人出主意，总比一两个人强。”经过这样的检讨，大家的思想又提高了一步，都开动脑筋研究改进办法。卢墨林说：“今年开展增产竞赛，依我看非大家出主意不行；咱们可以成立个增产委员会，领导全社开展增产竞赛。”大家都同意这个意见。他们选出李砚田、魏连玉做增产委员会的正副主任，又选了十个人做委员。委员会下设棉花、谷子、玉米、山芋等四个增产小组；根据每个人的专长，选出四个人分任组长，并把全社六十个整半劳动力分别配备到各小组里。这些小组分别管理各种超额丰产地，也兼管一般增产地。他们要把管理超额丰产地的经验，运用到一般增产地上，使全部土地都能增产。社员的分工也并不是机械的，遇到什么活要紧，就先集中力量做什么，由增产委员会统一支配调动。为了加强领导，增产委员会每天晚上要开碰头会，报告当天的生产情况，计划第二天的活计。每十天还要开两次生产小组会，研究生产计划的执行情况，结合进行爱国主义教育。
    这样做了以后，社的领导力量加强了。领导人员有事就和社员们商量；社员们的觉悟也更加提高了。争取增产竞赛的胜利，已成为全体社员一致的行动。他们抓紧时间完成了补苗，积极进行保苗，对抗旱、防虫等也作了较具体的计划。
