The recovery and construction work in old revolutionary base areas has made preliminary achievements under the leadership of governments at all levels.

Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the instruction on strengthening the work of old revolutionary base areas on January 28, the provinces (regions) of Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and southern and northern Anhui have successively established construction committees for old revolutionary base areas at the provincial (regional) level in March and April. They formulated production and construction plans for the old revolutionary base areas in their respective provinces (regions) and stipulated that this work would be one of the key tasks of their provinces (regions) in 1952. In its instruction issued on April 21, the Northwest Military and Political Committee required governments at all levels to pay close attention to strengthening the specific leadership of the work in old revolutionary base areas and called on the people and cadres at all levels in the old revolutionary base areas to take prompt action to launch a vigorous patriotic production increase movement throughout the region to strive for a bumper harvest this year and to ensure that everyone has enough to eat and every family has surplus grain within three years. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the provinces of Hebei and Fujian also instructed their respective special commissioner's offices on the methods for distributing the relief funds allocated by the central government to the old revolutionary base areas. In the work of distributing relief funds, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces convened provincial-scale representative conferences of people for production and construction in the old revolutionary base areas and jointly studied construction plans with representatives of the people from the old revolutionary base areas, formulated plans for recovery and construction work, and allocated various production loans. This not only made the people in the old revolutionary base areas feel honored and understand the care of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for them, but also greatly improved the political enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas and filled them with confidence in the recovery and construction work.

Governments at all levels regard the work of restoring and constructing the old revolutionary base areas as a glorious task and, proceeding from the perspective of long-term construction, grasped the spirit of the instructions of the Government Administration Council and formulated practical and feasible work plans based on local conditions. For example, Chahar Province "focused on implementing the ideas of key leadership and key construction," grasping forestry and animal husbandry in long-term construction; in agriculture, it strived to increase the yield per unit area as much as possible and launched a competition movement. The policy of Pingyuan Province is to "combine solving the current difficulties of the masses with long-term construction" to strive to change the economic face of the old revolutionary base areas within three to five years. Jiangxi, southern and northern Anhui, northern Sichuan, Guangdong and other provinces (regions) have also taken appropriate measures and strengthened the preferential treatment, sales of local products, cultural education, democratic political construction, and agricultural and forestry, water conservancy, transportation, cooperation, trade and other work in the old revolutionary base areas.

In order to enable the recovery and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas to be carried out rapidly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has allocated all of the 1952 relief funds for the old revolutionary base areas. The people's governments of the provinces with old revolutionary base areas have also organized a large number of loans and invested them in the old revolutionary base areas as funds for production and construction. For example, Shanxi Province invested a total of 35 billion yuan in various loans in the old revolutionary base areas in 1952; Pingyuan Province invested 10 billion yuan; Suiyuan Province invested 9.7 billion yuan; and Hebei Province allocated 4 million catties of millet for the people in the old revolutionary base areas to repair houses. This year, the Northwest Military and Political Committee allocated a total of 11.2 billion yuan in various agricultural loans to the old revolutionary base areas, and allocated 5.7 billion yuan in educational subsidies and 5.7 billion yuan in health subsidies to support the development of cultural and educational construction in the old revolutionary base areas. In terms of preferential treatment and relief, the central government and the major administrative regions have allocated a total of 20.5 billion yuan in relief funds, subsidies, and disaster relief funds to the old revolutionary base areas this year. At present, loans have long been distributed to households, greatly strengthening and enhancing the confidence of the people in the old revolutionary base areas to rebuild their homes.

However, some provinces are currently only simply forwarding and distributing relief funds, or entrusting the construction plans for the old revolutionary base areas to lower-level governments. These are all inappropriate. In order to implement the instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on strengthening the work of old revolutionary base areas, the National Old Revolutionary Base Area Construction Committee held its second committee meeting on June 12. In addition to reviewing the implementation of the instructions of the Government Administration Council by the central and local old revolutionary base area construction committees in the past six months, it also issued a notice requesting that the people's governments at the provincial level with jurisdiction over old revolutionary base areas should promptly establish old revolutionary base area construction committees if they have not yet been established; those who have not reported the construction plan of the old revolutionary base areas to the central government should promptly formulate a comprehensive recovery and construction plan for the old revolutionary base areas in their respective provinces (regions); all localities should attach importance to the experience of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces in convening representative conferences of the people in the old revolutionary base areas to promote the recovery and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas.

### 老根据地的恢复和建设工作推行状况

    老根据地的恢复和建设工作推行状况
    老根据地的恢复和建设工作，在各级人民政府领导下，已经有了初步成绩。
    自中央人民政府政务院一月二十八日颁布关于加强老根据地工作的指示后，察哈尔、绥远、平原、山西、广东、江西、皖南皖北等省（区）都在三、四月间先后建立了省（区）一级的老根据地建设委员会，制订了本省（区）老根据地的生产建设计划，并把这一工作规定为本省（区）一九五二年的工作重点之一。西北军政委员会在四月二十一日发出的指示中，要求各级人民政府必须切实注意加强对老根据地工作的具体领导，号召老根据地的人民和各级干部迅速行动起来，在全区展开一个轰轰烈烈的爱国丰产运动，争取今年大丰收；争取在三年之内做到人人有饭吃，家家有余粮。内蒙古自治区人民政府，河北、福建两省也向所属专署指示了发放中央拨给各老根据地救济费的办法。在发放救济费的工作中，察哈尔、绥远两省召开了全省规模的老根据地人民生产建设代表会议，和老根据地人民代表共同研究建设计划，制订恢复和建设工作方案，分配各项生产贷款，这不但使老根据地的人民感到光荣，体会了毛主席和中央人民政府对他们的关怀；并且大大提高了老根据地人民的政治积极性，对恢复建设工作充满了信心。
    各级人民政府把恢复建设老根据地的工作，看作光荣的任务，并从长期建设的观点出发，掌握着政务院指示的精神，依据当地具体情况，拟定了切实可行的工作计划。如察哈尔省即“注重贯彻重点领导和重点建设思想”，在长期建设中抓住林业和畜牧业两项工作；在农业方面尽可能提高单位面积产量，开展竞赛运动。平原省的方针是“解决群众当前困难和长期建设相结合”，争取在三五年内改变老根据地的经济面貌。江西、皖南皖北、川北、广东等省（区），也作了适宜的措施，并加强老根据地的优抚、土产运销、文化教育、民主建政以及农林、水利、交通、合作、贸易等工作。
    为使老根据地的恢复和建设工作得以迅速开展，中央人民政府内务部已把一九五二年老根据地救济费全数拨出。辖有老根据地的各省人民政府，也已组织大量贷款，投放老根据地作为生产建设的资金。如山西省一九五二年投放老根据地的各种贷款共三百五十亿元；平原省一百亿元；绥远省九十七亿元；河北省拨出四百万斤小米为老根据地人民作修缮房屋之用。西北军政委员会今年拨给老根据地的各种农业贷款共一百一十二亿元，拨出教育补助费五十七亿元，卫生补助费五十七亿元，以扶助老根据地文化教育建设事业的开展。在优抚、救济方面，中央和各大行政区今年拨给老根据地的救济费、补助费、救灾款，共二百零五亿元。目前各地贷款早已发到户，大大坚定和提高了老根据地人民重建家园的信心。
    但是，也有些省目前还只是单纯照转、分拨救济费，或把老根据地的建设计划委托下级政府去做。这都是不妥当的。为贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于加强老根据地工作的指示，全国老根据地建设委员会在六月十二日召开了第二次委员会议，除检查中央及各地老根据地建设委员会半年来对政务院指示执行的情况外，并发出通知，要求各辖有老根据地的省一级的人民政府，凡没有建立老根据地建设委员会的，应迅即建立；没有向中央报告老根据地建设计划的，要迅速拟定本省（区）对老根据地的全面恢复和建设计划；要各地重视察哈尔、绥远两省召开老根据地人民代表会议的经验，推动老根据地的恢复和建设工作。
