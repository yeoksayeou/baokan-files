Several Experiences in Pre-Purchasing Cotton in Dongdiyang Village, Ding County, This Year
Ding County Special District Cooperative Work Group

Dongdiyang Village in the Eighth District of Ding County, Hebei Province, has 203 households, 1,079 people, and 3,397 mu of cultivated land. The village has a relatively solid foundation for production: the vast majority of farmers in the village have been organized, with a total of 36 mutual aid teams. Cooperative members account for 50% of the village's population. The village's Communist Party branch secretary and village head, among other key cadres, participate in mutual aid teams and directly lead production. This year, Dongdiyang Village planted a total of 860 mu of cotton, with a planned yield of 106 jin per mu.

From April 26th to May 4th, the cooperative conducted pre-purchase cotton work in the village for eight days, achieving great results. A total of 42 cotton pre-purchase contracts were signed (36 with mutual aid teams, 6 with cooperative member groups), pre-purchasing 45,454 jin of seed cotton, accounting for 54.3% of the village's total cotton production. Credit pre-purchases accounted for 96.81% of the total pre-purchase value, while deposit pre-purchases accounted for only 3.19%. The goods that cotton farmers pre-ordered from the cooperative accounted for 14.4% of the cooperative's total pre-purchased cotton value.

When the cooperative pre-purchased cotton in the village, it first collected the masses' opinions on last year's cotton pre-purchase through village cadres. The general public believed that the cooperative's "scales were accurate and the prices were fair." However, last year the village signed contracts as a unit, and the scope of the contracts was too large, so they could not be reviewed by the masses. Some cotton farmers forgot how much cotton they had pre-sold and how many goods they had ordered when they delivered the cotton in the fall, which caused confusion.

Based on the above situation, the cooperative convened village cadres, propagandists, mutual aid team leaders, and cooperative member representatives to review the shortcomings in last year's pre-purchase work. At the same time, they implemented the spirit of this year's cotton pre-purchase and put forward specific methods. Someone asked at the meeting, "What if we sign a contract and can't pick the cotton?" Yang Luo Xuan said, "The current government is realistic and doesn't just talk, the whole village is watching, and we won't force you if you really can't pick it, but it's also wrong not to deliver the cotton if you have it." Someone else asked, "If prices fall in the fall, will households that used pre-paid grain for deposits suffer losses when they return the cotton?" After discussion, everyone agreed that the state controls prices and will not let the masses suffer losses. This first cleared the cadres' thinking and inspired the enthusiasm of the village's cadres; then, with Party members and cadres as the core, universal publicity and education was carried out, and the masses were publicized street by street and area by area. Each person was responsible for publicizing to two to three households, and propaganda materials were drafted based on the specific situation of the village. Publicity was carried out through blackboard newspapers, radio stations, people's schools, teachers, propagandists, and primary school students.

After publicity and mobilization, they helped cotton farmers formulate cotton sales and ordering plans. To do this complex and detailed work well, they first helped three relatively advanced mutual aid teams make cotton sales and ordering plans and asked them to give typical reports at mass meetings. This enabled the masses to understand how to make such plans and the benefits of making plans, and then called on mutual aid teams and cooperative member groups to make plans widely. In terms of methods, they first called on each household to hold a family meeting, combine it with the family's production increase plan and consumption plan, calculate carefully, and determine the amount of cotton to be sold and goods to be ordered; then, based on the household's plan, the group conducted democratic discussions to make a preliminary plan for the group's cotton sales and ordering. To ensure that the plan was accurate and true, the preliminary plan formulated by each group was reviewed by cadres, returned to the group, repeatedly discussed and revised, and finally a formal contract was signed with the cooperative.

To promote credit pre-purchases and focus on the use of pre-paid deposits, the cooperative widely conducted patriotic education among the masses, explaining the importance of credit pre-purchases. The cooperative's pre-purchase of cotton farmers' cotton did not require pre-paid deposits, indicating that farmers' orders from the cooperative also did not require pre-paid deposits, so neither side would suffer losses. At the same time, cotton farmers who signed contracts were educated to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity and to let the truly needy households use the cooperative's pre-purchase deposits. This enabled the deposits to achieve the purpose of focused use.

After the village's mutual aid teams and cooperative member groups initially prepared their production and consumption plans, they began to sign contracts, starting with the mutual aid groups and driving the cooperative member groups. A group of people to fill out contracts had been cultivated in advance in a planned way. To seize the time and not delay agricultural work, the whole village was divided into five areas to carry out the work simultaneously, with one to two cadres drawn from each area to supervise and inspect at any time and check the contracts for errors. This was done quickly, and in just one day, 26 contracts were signed, pre-purchasing more than 26,000 jin of seed cotton.

The cooperative's pre-purchase of cotton in Dongdiyang Village has yielded the following experiences:

First, it is necessary to take the Party branch as the core, with Party and League members as the backbone, and widely and deeply carry out publicity and mobilization work through various occasions and in various forms, to explain the main significance and specific methods of pre-purchasing cotton clearly to cadres and the masses, so that everyone knows it. This is the key to carrying out the work. After understanding the significance of pre-purchasing cotton, cotton farmer An Chao San said: "The method of signing cotton pre-purchase contracts is very good and benefits everyone. We have already signed a contract and must take good care of the cotton and ensure that we act in accordance with the contract." When carrying out publicity, it is necessary to educate the masses to help each other and make concessions in the use of deposits, which is the key to implementing the principle of credit pre-purchase.

Second, it is most appropriate for cooperatives to sign cotton pre-purchase contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and cooperative member groups. The village first helped two agricultural production units to formulate cotton pre-sale plans and signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, and then asked them to give typical reports at mass meetings, which played a great role in promoting the work.

Implementing household plans, group reviews, and repeated discussions combines cotton farmers' production increase plans and sales plans, so that the contracts signed can be truly grasped by the cotton farmers participating in the contracts. At the same time, the process of signing contracts is also a process of consolidating cotton farmers' belief in abiding by contracts. When signing a contract, An Guo Xiang, who had newly joined the mutual aid team, initially planned to pre-sell cotton according to last year's yield (80 jin per mu). After the group helped him study, he re-raised this year's cotton field yield to 100 jin per mu, so the amount of cotton he pre-sold also increased compared to before.

After the contracts are signed, a celebration meeting can be held to celebrate the victory of signing the contracts to consolidate the results already achieved. At the victory celebration meeting for signing contracts in Dongdiyang Village, the supply and marketing cooperative stated its attitude, guaranteeing to purchase cotton and supply all orders in accordance with the contracts; the groups that signed the contracts also put forward representatives who proposed specific conditions for guaranteeing the implementation of the contracts at the meeting. Cotton farmer An Luo Shun said: "The contract is not signed casually, I keep it with the land certificate and will act according to it in the future."

    河北定县东堤阳村今年预购棉花的几点经验
    定县专区合作社工作组
    河北省定县八区东堤阳村共有二百零三户，一千零七十九人，耕地三千三百九十七亩。该村生产较有基础：全村绝大部分农户已经组织起来，共有互助组三十六个。合作社社员人口，占全村人口的百分之五十。该村中共支部书记和村长等主要干部，都分头参加互助组，直接领导生产。今年东堤阳村共种棉花八百六十亩，每亩产量计划达到一百零六斤。
    从四月二十六日到五月四日的八天中，合作社在该村展开预购棉花工作，取得了很大成绩。计共订立预购棉花合同四十二件（和互助组订三十六件、和社员小组订六件），预购籽棉四万五千四百五十四斤，占全村棉花总产量的百分之五十四点三。其中实行信用预购的占预购总值百分之九十六点八一，实行订金预购的只占预购总值的百分之三点一九。棉农向合作社预定购买的货物，占合作社预购棉总值的百分之十四点四。
    合作社在该村预购棉花时，首先通过村干部搜集了群众对去年预购棉花的意见。一般群众认为合作社的“秤头准、价钱公道”。但是该村去年是以村为单位订立合同，合同的范围太大，不能和群众见面，有的棉农到秋后交棉花时，忘记预售出多少棉花和订了多少货品，所以发生了紊乱现象。
    根据以上情况，合作社召集了村干部和宣传员、互助组长、社员代表开会，检讨去年预购工作中的缺点，同时贯彻今年预购棉花的精神，提出了具体办法。有人在会上提出：“订了合同棉花摘不出来怎么办？”杨洛宣说：“现在的政府是实事求是，不凭嘴说，全村群众都看着哩，真摘不出来也不强求，可是有棉花不交也不对”。又有人提出：“秋后物价下跌，用了预付定金粮的户还棉花时要吃亏。”这个问题经过争论，大家一致认为：国家掌握物价不会让群众吃亏。这样首先打通了干部思想，启发了全村干部工作的积极性；接着就以党员干部为核心，展开了普遍的宣传教育，分街分片向群众进行宣传，每人保证宣传两户到三户，并根据村里的具体情况，拟出通俗的宣传材料，通过黑板报、广播台、民校，教师、宣传员、小学生等进行宣传。
    经过宣传动员，跟着就帮助棉农制定售棉订货计划。为了做好这一复杂细密的工作，首先有计划地帮助三个较先进的互助组作出售棉订货计划，由他们在群众大会上作典型报告。这样就能使群众明了怎样做这种计划和作计划的好处，然后号召互助组、社员小组广泛作计划。在方法上，首先号召各户召开家庭会议，结合家庭增产计划及消费计划，算细账，确定售棉订货数量；然后，以户的计划为基础，以小组为单位进行民主讨论，作出全组售棉订货的初步计划。为了使计划做到确切真实，各小组制订的初步计划再经干部审查，交回小组，反复讨论修正，最后和合作社正式签订合同。
    合作社为了提倡信用预购和重点使用预付定金，广泛地向群众进行爱国主义教育，说明信用预购的重要意义。合作社预购棉农的棉花不预付定金，说明农民订购合作社的货物也不预付定金，这样两不吃亏。同时教育订立合同的棉农发扬互助友爱的精神，把合作社的预购定金，让给真正有困难的户使用。这就使定金达到了重点使用的目的。
    全村的互助组和社员小组初步作好生产，消费计划之后，便开始订立合同。由互助小组订起，带动社员小组。预先有计划地培养了一批填写合同的人员。为了抓紧时间不误农时，全村分五片同时进行，每片抽出干部一至二人，随时督促检查，核对合同有无错误。这样做起来是很快的，只一天的工夫，就订了二十六件合同，预购籽棉两万六千余斤。
    合作社在东堤阳村预购棉花，取得了以下几点经验：
    首先要以党的支部为核心，以党、团员为骨干，通过各种场合，利用各种形式，广泛深入地开展宣传动员工作，把预购棉花的主要意义和具体作法，向干部、群众讲清楚，做到家喻户晓，这是开展工作的关键。棉农安朝三在了解了预购棉花的意义以后说：“订立预购棉花合同的办法很好，对谁也有好处。我们已经订了合同，就一定要把棉花收拾好，保证按合同办事。”进行宣传时，要教育群众在使用定金上互助互让，这是贯彻以信用预购为主的方针的关键。
    其次，合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组、社员小组订预购棉花合同最为恰当。该村首先帮助两个农业生产单位，制订了预售棉花计划，并与供销合作社订了合同，然后请他们在群众大会上作了典型报告，起了很大的推动作用。
    实行户计划、组审查和反复讨论，使棉农的增产计划和推销计划结合起来，这样订立起来的合同才能真正为参与订合同的棉农所掌握。同时，订立合同的过程，也就是巩固棉农遵守合同的信念的过程。该村新参加互助组的安国祥在订合同时，开始仍按去年的产量（每亩八十斤）计划预售棉花，经小组帮助研究，他又重新把今年每亩棉田产量提高到一百斤，因此他预售棉花的数量也较前增加了。
    合同订妥后，可以召开庆祝订立合同胜利大会，以巩固已得的成果。供销合作社在东堤阳村庆祝订立合同胜利大会上，表明了态度，保证按合同收购棉花和供应全部订货；订立合同的小组也推出代表，在会上提出了保证执行合同的具体条件。棉农安洛顺说：“合同不是随便订的，我把它和土地证放在一起保存起来，今后要照它办事哩。”
