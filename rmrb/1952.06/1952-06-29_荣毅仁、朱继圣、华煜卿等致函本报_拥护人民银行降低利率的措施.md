    Rong Yiren, Zhu Jisheng, Hua Yuqing, and Others Send Letters to This Newspaper: Supporting the People's Bank of China's Measures to Lower Interest Rates

    The People's Bank of China's head office decided to lower bank interest rates by 20 to 50 percent in June. Industrialists and businessmen in various regions unanimously expressed their support for this measure. Recently, Rong Yiren, representative of the East China region to the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and general manager of Shenxin Cotton Mill Corporation; Zhu Jisheng, Tianjin industrial and commercial representative, vice chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and manager of Tianjin Renli Industrial Company; Hua Yuqing, representative of Wuhan City in the Central South region, chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, and deputy director of the general management office of Shenxin Cotton Mill, and others who came to Beijing to attend the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce preparatory representative meeting, sent letters to this newspaper successively, expressing their thoughts.

    Rong Yiren said: The People's Bank of China's further reduction of interest rates once again powerfully demonstrates the government's consistent policy of supporting industry and commerce and developing production. Industrialists and businessmen are sincerely inspired by this correct measure of the government. Lowering bank interest rates is of great significance to the development of industry and commerce. Because after the bank interest rates are lowered, not only does it directly reduce the interest burden on industry and commerce, but it will also promote the investment of a large amount of idle capital in production, providing more guarantees for the source of funds for business operators. This is not only very beneficial to industrial production, but also will have a great effect on the expansion of material exchanges between urban and rural areas. Recalling the time before liberation, when prices were unstable, the currency value declined, and speculation prevailed among industrialists and businessmen across the country, especially in Shanghai. After liberation, the country implemented unified financial and economic policies, the currency value was consolidated, prices were stabilized, and the government gradually reduced bank interest rates, enabling our industry and commerce to gradually recover from a dying state; not only maintaining production, but also gradually moving towards development. This also makes us more deeply appreciate the People's Government's unwavering policy of developing production and prospering the economy.

    He said that in the future, we will further strengthen unity, actively produce, improve management, and never fail to live up to the government's support for industry and commerce and the national people's expectations of the industrial and commercial circles.

    Zhu Jisheng said: This time the bank lowered interest rates, just after the end of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. This has great significance and impact on developing production and encouraging industrialists and businessmen to expand their operations. The reduction in deposit interest can make people holding cash turn their attention to investing in production. The reduction in loan interest can directly reduce production costs and accelerate capital turnover. For this wise measure of the People's Government, we industrialists and businessmen should not only say empty words of gratitude, but should work harder and wholeheartedly to do a good job in production and expand operations, and respond to the government's support for industry and commerce with practical actions.

    Hua Yuqing said: We industrialists and businessmen across the country fully support this measure. This is a major good news for industrialists and businessmen across the country. Because it is related to the entire future of industrial and commercial development, especially in the industrial aspect, costs will inevitably be further reduced due to lower interest rates; at the same time, it will gradually inject social idle capital into production enterprises. However, it must be pointed out that our industrialists and businessmen lacked a correct understanding of the significance of national financial policies in the past, so a small number of illegal industrialists and businessmen used various illegal means to embezzle funds and engage in speculation, these facts have been exposed in the great "Five-Anti" movement. In order to promote the active side of private capital, the state quickly formulated preferential loan measures after the "Five-Anti" movement to support private industry and commerce; now it has further lowered bank interest rates, creating more favorable conditions for the development of private industry and commerce.

    荣毅仁、朱继圣、华煜卿等致函本报
    拥护人民银行降低利率的措施
    中国人民银行总行决定在六月份内降低银行利率百分之二十至五十，各地工商业者对于这一措施，一致表示拥护。最近来北京参加中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的华东区代表、上海市工商业联合会副主任委员、申新纱厂总公司总经理荣毅仁，天津市工商业代表、天津市工商业联合会副主任委员、天津仁立实业公司经理朱继圣，中南区武汉市代表、武汉市工商业联合会主任委员、申新纱厂总管理处副处长华煜卿等，先后投函本报，发表感想。
    荣毅仁说：人民银行再度降低利率，又一次有力地表现了政府一贯扶植工商业和发展生产的政策。对于政府这一正确措施，工商业者都是由衷的感奋。银行利率的降低，对工商业的发展是有很大意义的。因为银行利率降低后，不但直接地减轻了工商业的利息负担，而且将促使社会上大量的游资投入生产，给企业经营者的资金来源，提供了更多的保证。这不但对于工业生产十分有利，就是对城乡物资交流的扩大，也将发生很大作用。回想在解放以前，物价不稳，币值下落，全国各地，特别是在上海，工商业者投机成风。解放后，全国实行财经统一，币值巩固，物价稳定，政府并逐步地降低了银行利率，使我们的工商业从奄奄一息的境地，逐渐恢复过来；不但维持了生产，并且逐步走向发展。这也就使我们更深刻地体会到人民政府发展生产、繁荣经济的坚定不移的政策。
    他说，今后我们将进一步加强团结，积极生产，改善经营，决不辜负政府对工商业的扶植，和全国人民对工商界的热望。
    朱继圣说：这次银行减低利率，刚刚在“三反”
    “五反”运动结束之后。这在发展生产、鼓励工商业者扩大经营上，有重大的意义和影响。存款利息的减低，可使持有现金的人们，把眼光转向投资生产。放款的利息减低了，更可直接减低生产成本，加速资金周转。对人民政府这一贤明的措施，我们工商业者，不应该只说感激的空话，而应该更加努力地、全心全意地来搞好生产，扩大经营，以实际行动来回答政府对工商业的扶植。
    华煜卿说：我们全国工商业者对这一措施完全拥护。这对全国工商业者来说，是一大喜讯。因为它关系着整个工商业的发展前途，尤其工业方面，必然由于利率降低，而进一步减低成本；同时使社会游资逐渐投入生产事业。但要指出，我们工商业者，过去对国家金融政策的意义缺乏正确认识，因此曾有少数不法工商业者，用各种非法手段，套用资金，投机倒把，这些事实，在伟大的“五反”运动中，已经暴露出来。国家为了发扬私人资本的积极一面，在“五反”运动以后，迅速地订出了优惠的贷款办法，以扶助私营工商业；今又进一步地降低银行利率，更给私营工商业的发展创造了有利条件。
