Love and Not Love
Ke Dong

The article "A Worker's Opinion on Literary Workers," published in the *Liberation Daily*, is full of the simple and sincere feelings of the working class. From this article, we can see how concerned the workers are about the ideological remolding of literary workers and how much they expect from it.

Regarding the ideological remolding of literary workers, this article puts forward very pertinent opinions. Truly loving labor and production, or not truly loving labor and production, is the main dividing line between working-class ideology and petty-bourgeois ideology. From not truly loving labor and production to truly loving labor and production (that is, truly loving the working people), "this is called a change in emotion, from one class to another class" (Mao Zedong).

Here, I am reminded of a few things: Not long ago, a literary worker went to a factory full of eagerness to remold himself. At first, he worked in the security department and generally had a good relationship with the workers in the security department. Later, he was assigned to work in the dormitory building, and his relationship with the workers in the security department became more distant. Once, he passed by the security department, and the workers were extremely enthusiastic when they saw him. Because they had not seen each other for a long time, they ran over to embrace him. But this literary worker suddenly felt that the worker who was hugging him was very dirty, and couldn't help but twist away. The worker immediately noticed this and said, "I'll wash my hands and come back." Another literary worker, after arriving at the factory, made his bed very elaborate. Once, several workers went to visit him, and when he saw that his worker comrades wanted to sit on his bed, his expression was very unnatural. The workers saw his thoughts from his expression and said, "It's okay, we'll sit on the floor." The writer quickly said, "Hey, the floor is too dirty – I have some toilet paper here." (The meaning is that the floor is not clean, so put some toilet paper down.) From these two things, we can see that these two literary workers, they may have the determination to go to the factory to remold themselves, and their relationship with the working class is still good, which are all very good; but, it is just these two writers, as long as there is a direct relationship between their immediate and personal issues - even just a little bit - such as hugging him or sitting on his bed, their true love and unloving thoughts and feelings are completely exposed. It turns out that their love for the working class is not real love, they always feel that the workers are dirty; what they love most is themselves, thinking that only they are the cleanest. In the depths of their minds, it is still a "petty-bourgeois kingdom."

The motives of these two literary workers going to the factory are still relatively good, as for those who hold "dissatisfaction with the leadership of the working class" and "want to see if the working class is selfless" and go to the factory, their lack of love for the workers is even more obvious. Therefore, it can also be known that the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie are quite deeply rooted in some people. Ideological remolding is not as some people imagine, that it can be solved by just taking a few strolls in factories and rural areas or reading a few books on theory.

Therefore, in the literary rectification campaign, we might as well examine what things you truly love, and what things you do not love. Uncovering, without concealment and without being deceived by certain illusions, the things you love and do not love from the depths of your mind can help us find the root cause of ideological illness.

    爱与不爱

    解放日报所载“一个工人对文艺工作者的意见”
    一文，充满着工人阶级的朴实、热诚的情感。从这篇文章里可以看出工人对文艺工作者的思想改造问题是多么关心，并寄与多么大的期望。
    关于文艺工作者的思想改造问题，这文章提出了很中肯的意见。真正爱劳动和生产，或者不真正爱劳动和生产，这就是工人阶级思想与小资产阶级思想的主要分界线。由不真正爱劳动和生产到真正爱劳动和生产（也就是真正爱劳动人民），“这就叫做感情起了变化，由一个阶级变到另一个阶级。”
    （毛主席语）。
    这里，我联想起几件事来：不久以前，有一个文艺工作者，满怀改造自己的热望到工厂里去了。起先，他在保全部工作，一般说与保全部工人的关系搞得还好；后来，他又被派到筒子间工作，就与保全部工人的关系比较疏远了。有一次，他走过保全部，工人看见他来，真是热情极了，因为彼此已好久不见面，所以就跑来拥抱他。但是这个文艺工作者忽然觉得这个拥抱他的工人身子很脏，不禁扭了一下，工人立刻察觉到这个了，就说：“我洗了手再来吧。”另有一个文艺工作者，到工厂后，把自己的床铺弄得很讲究。有一次，好几个工人去找他玩，他看到工人同志要坐他的床时，表情显得很不自然，工人从他的表情中看出他的思想，就说：“不要紧，我们坐地下吧。”这个作家也连忙说：“哎，地下太脏——我这里有草纸。”（意思就是说地上不干净，拿草纸垫一垫吧。）从这两件事，就可以看出，这两个文艺工作者，他们可能有下厂改造自己的决心，他们和工人阶级的关系还搞得不错，这些都是很好的；但是，就是这两个作家，只要在直接和他的切身问题发生一下——那怕是一点点——关系时，诸如拥抱他一下和坐坐他的床等，他们的真正爱与不爱的思想感情就完全暴露出来了。原来他们对工人阶级还不是真正的爱，他们总觉得工人是脏的；他们最爱的还是自己，以为只有自己才是最干净的。他们的思想深处，原来还是一个“小资产阶级的王国”。
    这两个文艺工作者下厂的动机还算比较好的，至于那些抱着“对工人阶级领导不服贴”，“要去看看工人阶级是否大公无私”而下厂的人，其不爱工人是更显然了。因此，也就可以知道：资产阶级与小资产阶级的思想对某些人说，是相当根深柢固的。思想改造，并不是如某些人所想像，只要到工厂、农村去遛几趟或者看几本理论书就可以解决的。
    因此，我们在文艺整风中，倒不妨检查一下，你所真正爱的东西，到底是那些东西，你所不爱的东西，到底是那些东西。从思想深处不隐瞒地、不被某些假象所迷惑地、挖掘出爱与不爱的东西，就可以帮助我们找到思想的病根。
