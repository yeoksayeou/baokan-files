Xinhua News Agency excerpt from the Soviet magazine "News," Issue 11, by Yitijin

The editor of "News" magazine called me long-distance from Moscow and raised this question. He said: Many foreign readers want to know more about the living standards in the Soviet Union. I agreed to write such an article. "News" magazine asked to write about a very ordinary family, one that could be considered typical. Therefore, to avoid being accused of choosing a "special" example, I had to be very careful in my selection, trying to avoid choosing a family that others would consider "above average."

I went to the personnel department of the Molotov Steel Plant. As a result, I found Yevgeny Vladimirov, a 45-year-old maintenance and repair worker, living in room 34, apartment 12 on Malat Street. Vladimirov's salary was not too high, and his apartment, with only two rooms, was quite simple.

Climbing to the sixth floor was indeed quite tiring. The door was opened by a pleasant-looking middle-aged woman, Yelizaveta Vladimirova, the mistress of the house. It seemed she was about to go shopping, as she had a bag on her arm. She invited me into the dining room and introduced me to the whole family: Vladimirov, who was installing a table lamp; Lida, a girl of about thirteen, who was playing the piano; and the eldest daughter, Valeria, who was trying on a new hat in front of the mirror.

After I sat down, the first thing I asked about was Vladimirov's income. His general income was about 1,800 to 1,900 rubles, sometimes even up to 2,000 rubles, depending on how well he completed his quota.

"What about the others in your workshop? Do they earn more or less than you?"

"Our wages are generally about the same."

"Does anyone else in your family work?"

"Valeria helps out a bit," he said with a smile, nodding towards his eldest daughter. "She works in a technical institution, but..."

"But what?"

"Well, as you can understand, she's young and wants to be fashionable and so on. In short, her income doesn't contribute much to the family expenses."

"Then is your own salary enough for expenses?"

"Well, I have nothing to complain about."

During our conversation, Vladimirov's wife returned. She took out packages of cheese, sausage, and butter from her bag and put them in the nearby cabinet. She suggested making coffee, and her husband agreed. Then, Vladimirov asked her to help "calculate the family income and expenditure."

He took out paper and pen and asked her to join our conversation: "We need your expertise."

"Let's study this budget and calculate it carefully.

"The first item is income. After deducting income tax, we have 1,900 rubles left. The rent is 32 rubles, which is about 1.5 percent of the total income. Water, electricity, and gas—that's about another 20 rubles. Then there's heating and other miscellaneous expenses, so these items add up to about 100 rubles per month."

"What are the main expenses?"

Vladimirov turned to his wife.

"Of course, it's the food expenses," she replied. "The several price reductions have helped us a lot. I calculated that before the latest price reduction in April this year, our daily food expenses were between 35 and 45 rubles. Now we only need to pay 25 to 35 rubles to buy the same amount of food. This includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. In total, this aspect costs about 900 rubles per month. The recent price reductions allow us to save about 130 to 150 rubles per month. We now spend 300 rubles less per month on food than before the price reduction in 1950."

"Since then, has your husband's salary decreased?"

"Of course not. In the first year after the war, his monthly income was about 1,300 to 1,400 rubles, then it increased to 1,500 to 1,600 rubles, and now his average salary always stays at 2,000 rubles."

"What is the rest of the money used for? I mean, the money left over after food."

"There are many places to spend money. We have bought a lot of furniture in recent years. All our previous belongings were lost in the war. Our previous house on Gorokhovaya Street was bombed, so we had to temporarily live with relatives. Later, the factory gave us a room, a very small one, and we lived there very squeezed. Now, they gave us this apartment—this used to be the technician's residence. All our things here—food cabinet, wardrobe, bookcase, sofa, piano, and bed, except for one bed that was rescued after the bombing, almost everything else was purchased in the past two or three years. In addition, we rent a place in the countryside in the summer, which also requires an extra expense. This aspect costs about 500 rubles for a summer."

I inquired about their expenses on recreation and entertainment, and learned that this was also an important expense. The whole family goes to the theater at least once a month. They go to the movies almost every Saturday or Sunday. They also often visit museums, especially the Russian Museum and the famous art galleries. For example, last Sunday, they took little Lida to visit the Chinese art exhibition being held there.

They are members of the district and municipal libraries, which are free. The cost of newspapers and magazines is about 100 rubles per year.

After Vladimirov told me all these details, he then expressed his opinion:

"If you plan to write about my family's income and expenditure, you should especially mention that wages are only part of my total income. Take education, for example. Valeria has finished secondary school and is now in her second year of night school at a commercial college. But all this doesn't cost me much money. The same is true for the little girl: she is also studying at the Children's Palace of Culture. At first, she joined the sports group, and now she has joined the dance school, learning under the guidance of professional teachers. All this is free."

We discussed these "intangible" family incomes in detail, and Vladimirov gave some examples to illustrate how important these "intangible" incomes are.

"You say that British newspapers advertise that British workers live better. But, in their country, can an ordinary fitter like me have a paid vacation every year? Can they stay in sanatoriums for free or at very low cost? I think these two are very important factors in my standard of living. Last year, I spent my vacation in a rest home, and this year, in just ten days, I will go to Kislovodsk in the Caucasus for vacation."

"Is this all free?"

"For me, it doesn't cost money, but it costs the state 1,200 rubles."

"Please tell me, do you also have sick leave?"

"Sometimes. My health is not as good as before the war, you know it's the impact of the war years."

"Does sick leave have any impact on family income and expenditure?"

"No impact at all. This year, I haven't worked for six weeks, but I still get my full salary, and I don't need to pay for medical expenses. Although several professors have been consulted for my illness, I don't have to pay any treatment costs."

"According to your estimation, how big a role do these 'intangible' items play in your family income?"

Vladimirov replied: "I have never calculated it. But, it should be said that it accounts for at least 30 percent, maybe even 35 percent. These items include: free medical treatment for the whole family, education for the children, annual paid vacations, and sanatorium stays paid for by the trade union. I think we should also include free libraries and Lida's dance school, and so on. All these extra benefits are equal to a family income of 2,500 rubles."

Vladimirov finally said: "I never worry about not having a job or income. I know that my children will definitely learn a skill when they grow up, and they will definitely be able to use what they have learned. I know the taste of unemployment, although I was very young when there was unemployment here. But for the younger generation, unemployment is nothing more than an abstract concept. We haven't gotten everything we need yet. I plan to buy a television set, and I also plan to gradually save up to buy a 'Moskvich' car. For now, both of these things are still in the planning stage. However, these are not important things. I think the most worthwhile thing in our lives is that we feel carefree, and we know that everything is getting better day by day. One day, I will be able to buy my car and have a better home. You can't expect everything to be ready all at once! But, what we all need most is lasting and solid peace."

    一个苏联家庭的收支情况
    伊提金作新华社摘译原载苏联“新闻”杂志第十一期
    “新闻”杂志的编辑从莫斯科打长途电话来，向我提出这个问题。他说：许多外国读者要求多知道一些关于苏联生活水准的情况。我同意写这样一篇文章。“新闻”杂志要求写一个非常普通的家庭，
    一个可以作为典型的。因此为了免得别人说我选了
    “特殊”的例子，我选择时就得十分小心，竭力避免选到别人认为“在一般水准以上”的家庭。
    我到了莫洛托夫钢铁厂的人事部里。结果找到了叶夫金尼·佛拉基米洛夫，一位四十五岁的保养修配工，住在马拉特街十二号公寓第三十四号房间。佛拉基米洛夫的薪金并不太高，他的寓所只有两个房间，算是十分简陋的了。
    爬到第六层楼也的确是相当辛苦的。出来开门的是一位面色愉快的中年妇女，这是叶丽沙维塔·佛拉基米洛娃，家庭女主人。看样子，她好像正要出去买东西，因为她臂上挂着一个口袋。她把我请进饭厅，并把我介绍给全家人：佛拉基米洛夫，正在安装一盏台灯；丽达，一个大约十三岁的女孩，正在弹钢琴；长女瓦勒丽雅，正在镜子前面试戴新帽子。
    我坐下之后，首先询问的当然就是佛拉基米洛夫的收入怎样。他一般的收入大约是一千八百到一千九百卢布，有时甚至多到两千卢布，这看他完成定额的情况怎样而定。
    “你们车间别的人的情形怎样呢？他们挣的工资比你多还是比你少？”
    “我们大家的工资一般都是差不多的。”
    “你家里还有谁工作的吗？”
    “瓦勒丽雅也帮一些忙，”他微笑着说，一面点头指指他的长女。“她在一个技术机关工作，不过……”
    “不过什么？”
    “唔，想来你也了解的，她年纪青，要学时髦等等。总之，她的收入并没有很多帮助家庭的开支。”
    “那么你自己的工资够开销吗？”
    “唔，我再也没有什么要抱怨的。”
    在我们谈话当中，佛拉基米洛夫的妻子回来了，她从口袋里取出一包包干酪、香肠和牛油等，放到旁边的柜里。她建议煮咖啡，她的丈夫表示赞同。接着，佛拉基米洛夫请她帮忙“核算一下家庭收支情况”。
    他拿了纸笔，请她参加我们的谈话：“我们需要你的专家知识。”
    “让我们来研究这个预算问题，好好的算一下。
    “第一项就是收入。在扣了所得税之后，尚余一千九百卢布。住房租金是三十二卢布，占收入总数约百分之一点五。水、电和煤气——大约又费二十卢布。然后，就是暖气费和其他零碎开支了，这样几项合计大概每月总共要一百卢布。”
    “主要的开支是什么呢？”
    佛拉基米洛夫掉头看他的妻子。
    “当然这要算伙食开支了，”她回答说。“几次减低物价对我们帮助很大。我算了一下，在今年四月最近一次减价之前，我们每天的伙食开支在三十五至四十五卢布之间，现在我们只要付二十五至三十五卢布便可以买到同样数量的食物。这包括早餐、午餐、晚餐和茶点。总计起来，这方面的开支大概是每月九百卢布。最近减低物价，使我们每月大概可以节省一百三十至一百五十卢布，我们现在用在食物方面的开支，比一九五○年减低物价之前，每月少花三百卢布。”
    “自从那以后，你丈夫的工资有降低了没有？”
    “当然没有。在战后的第一年里，他每月收入约一千三百至一千四百卢布，后来增加到一千五百至一千六百卢布，现在他的平均工资总是保持在两千卢布。”
    “其余的钱用在什么地方呢？我意思是说，在伙食之外余下的钱。”
    “要花钱的地方可多着哪。我们这几年来买了很多家具。我们以前的东西在战争当中全部丧失掉了。我们以前在哥罗霍瓦雅街的住宅被炸毁了，只好在亲戚家暂住。后来，工厂给了我们一个房间，小得很的，我们住在那里挤得要命。现在，他们给了我们这一套房间——这里原来是技士长住的地方。我们这里的全部东西——食物柜、衣橱、书架、沙发、钢琴和床，除了一张床是轰炸之后抢救出来的以外，其他的几乎全都是在过去两三年里购置的。此外，夏天我们在乡下租一个地方住，也需要一笔额外的开销。这方面大概一夏要花五百卢布。”
    我询问他们在消遣和娱乐等方面的开销情形，知道了这也是一项重要的开支。全家每月至少去观剧
    一次。电影是几乎每个星期六或星期日都要去看一次的。他们也常常去参观博物馆，特别是常去俄罗斯博物馆和有名的艺术馆。例如，上星期日，他们就带了小丽达去参观正在那里举行的中国艺术展览会。
    他们参加了区立和市立的图书馆，这是免费的。报纸和杂志的费用每年大约要一百卢布。
    佛拉基米洛夫给我谈了这一切详细情况之后，跟着表示意见说：
    “假如你打算写我的家庭收支情况，你最好特别提一提，工资只不过是我的总收入的一部分。就以教育来说罢。瓦勒丽雅念完了中学，现在正在上商业学院的夜校二年级。可是这一切并不需要我花多少钱。小女孩的情形也是一样：她也在少先文化宫上学。起初她参加体育组，现在她已加入了舞蹈学校，在专业教师的指导下学习。这一切都是免费的。”
    我们详尽地讨论了这些“无形”的家庭收入，佛拉基米洛夫还举了一些例子，说明这些“无形”收入是多么重要。
    “你说，英国报纸宣传英国工人的生活比较好。但是，在他们那里，像我这样的一个普通装配工，每年能够有一次工资照发的假期吗？他们能够免费或仅付很低的费用住疗养院吗？我以为，这两项都是我的生活水准中十分重要的因素。去年，我在一个休养所里度假期，今年，就在十天以后，我将要去高加索的基斯罗洛德斯克度假。”
    “这是不是全部免费的呢？”
    “就我来说，这是不用花钱的，但是却要国家花
    一千二百卢布。”
    “请告诉我，你是不是也有请病假的时候呢？”
    “有时有的。我的健康已经不如战前了，你知道这是战争年代的影响。”
    “病假对家庭收支有什么影响吗？”
    “完全没有影响。今年，我有六个星期没有工作，但是我照样领得全部工资，而且也不需付医药费。我的病虽然请过好几位教授诊治，但是我一点也不用花治疗费用。”
    “照你估计，这些‘无形’项目在你的家庭收入中占多大的地位。”
    佛拉基米洛夫回答说：“我从来没有计算过。但是，应该说，最低限度占百分之三十，也许甚至占百分之三十五。这些项目包括：全家人的免费医药治疗，孩子们的教育，每年工资照发的假期，由工会出钱的疗养院休养。我以为，我们还应该把免费的图书馆和丽达上的舞蹈学校等等，也算在这里面。这一切额外的福利等于二千五百卢布的家庭收入。”
    佛拉基米洛夫最后说：“我无论什么时候都不愁没有工作，没有收入。我知道，我的孩子们长大了一定会学得一技之长，而且一定能够学以致用。我晓得失业的味道，虽然在我们这里有失业现象存在的时候，我年纪还很轻。但是对于年青的一代来说，失业已经不外乎是一个抽象的概念。我们现在还没有得到我们所需要的一切。我打算买一个电视器，我还打算渐渐积蓄起来买一辆‘莫斯科人’小汽车。就目前来说，这两件事都还在计划阶段。然而，这都不是重要的事。我以为，我们生活中最值得提的就是，我们感觉到无忧无虑，我们晓得样样事情都一天比一天好。总有一天，我能够买到我的小汽车，还能有一个更好的住所。你不能希望一下子样样东西都齐备！但是，我们大家一致最需要的是持久、巩固的和平。”
