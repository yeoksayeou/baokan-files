Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 28th: On June 25th, commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army presented 400,000 jin of grain saved recently to the people of Pyongyang as a gift to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean People's War Against America. The grain donation ceremony was held at the Pyongyang People's Committee on the 25th. Attendees included representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Kim Song-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, Vice-Chairmen Hong Ki-hwang and Lim Seung-dam, Yoon Gong-heum, Chairman of the Pyongyang City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, cadres from Pyongyang's Party and government organs, representatives from mass organizations, and people from all walks of life, totaling over one hundred people.

At the beginning of the ceremony, Kim Song-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee, delivered a speech first. On behalf of all the people of Pyongyang, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for their righteous act. Next, a representative of the Volunteer Army stood up to speak. He said: The heroic people of Pyongyang, in extremely difficult circumstances, have consistently and actively assisted and supported the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, helping the Chinese People's Volunteer Army overcome many difficulties and giving us great encouragement. Due to the frenzied bombing and barbaric destruction by the American invaders, the people of Pyongyang have experienced hardship in their lives. Therefore, commanders and fighters of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army have voluntarily donated the grain they have saved to help our brothers and sisters in Pyongyang overcome their difficulties. Although the amount of grain is small, it expresses the infinite love of the Chinese people for the Korean people. We firmly believe that as the friendship, unity, and fighting strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples are increasingly consolidated and strengthened, we will inflict even heavier blows on the American invaders until we force them to accept our fair and reasonable plan for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The grain donation ceremony proceeded in an atmosphere of friendship and unity. Chairman Kim Song-hak also read out a letter of gratitude from all the people of Pyongyang to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter said: Dear commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Holding high the banner of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, you came to the Korean battlefield and established immortal meritorious services. You not only repelled the frenzied attacks of the American invaders, but also shattered the enemy's attempt to turn Korea into a military base for attacking China and the Soviet Union, making great contributions to the great cause of preventing a third world war. Not only that, but in the intervals between battles, you have also helped our people in the rear who lack labor. You save your own grain to relieve our farmers and disaster victims in the war zone. Last year, the commanders and fighters of your Zhujiang troops sent us a large amount of grain, clothing, and other materials. Today—"Anti-Imperialist Struggle Day"—you have sent us another 400,000 jin of grain. All the people of Pyongyang extend our warm thanks to you. You are always and everywhere like a family, treating our suffering as your own and giving deep assistance and sympathy. You are the Korean people's close comrades-in-arms, you are a true people's army. Your righteous act has once again demonstrated the glorious example of internationalism to the freedom-loving people of the world. This inspires us to be determined, in the struggle to win the independence of our motherland and peace in Asia and the world, to complete our sacred internationalist mission with even stronger fighting spirit. More glorious victory and greater glory belong to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
