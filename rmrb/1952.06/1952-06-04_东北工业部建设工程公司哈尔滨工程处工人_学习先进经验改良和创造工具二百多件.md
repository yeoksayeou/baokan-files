    Workers of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company
    Learn from Advanced Experience to Improve and Create More Than 200 Tools
    The entire workforce of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Northeast Industrial Department Construction Engineering Company, in the process of learning from the advanced experiences of Su Changyou, Fu Hongbin, Xie Wanfu, and Yang Dezhong in bricklaying, carpentry, and plastering, has sparked a wave of finding tricks to improve tools. As of May 25th, the workers had improved and created 215 types of tools, of which 54 have been tested and preliminarily proven successful, and 161 need to be introduced to specialized agencies for further research.
    In the movement to promote advanced experience, the workers summarized the advantages and disadvantages of the original tools and strived to improve them. A group of workers in the fourth carpentry team automatically contributed money to purchase small electric motors in order to create an electric cut-off machine. The efficiency of the marking machine used by Xie Wanfu's team was too low, so the workers automatically conducted research and improved the marking tool; in the past, only first-class technicians could mark lines, but now ordinary workers can also do it. The workers in this team have improved nearly 20 tools, making them the unit with the most tool improvements in the engineering office.
    In the process of improving tools, a competition was launched between various types of work. The marker created a marking machine, increasing efficiency by five times. The hole puncher in the next process saw that if they did not improve their tools, they would not be able to meet the requirements of the previous process. They collectively created a manual hole punching machine, also increasing efficiency by five times, catching up with the markers.
    In order to promote tool improvement among workers, the engineering office held an exhibition of improved tools. Many workers visited the exhibition and were deeply moved. A new worker, Hao Li, resolved to learn from the veteran workers and set a plan to create three types of tools; he has already completed one. The leadership fully supported, provided timely assistance, and provided timely praise, which greatly promoted the tool improvement competition. In order to encourage workers to create, it was stipulated that all materials and cash spent by workers to improve tools would be borne by the engineering office; such actions by workers would be praised and encouraged. As a result, workers became bolder in creating and improving tools. In the tool improvement competition, the leadership organized technical personnel to participate in the movement, enabling them to help workers create and improve tools in theory, which had a very good effect.
                                                                                                (Li Ganzhong)

    东北工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处工人
    学习先进经验改良和创造工具二百多件
    东北工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处全体工人，在学习苏长有、傅鸿宾、谢万福、杨德重的砌砖、木工、抹灰等先进经验的过程中，掀起了找窍门改良工具的热潮。到五月二十五日，该处工人已改良和创造工具二百十五种，其中经试验和初步试验成功的共五十四种，需要介绍到专门机关继续研究的有一百六十一种。
    在推广先进经验的运动中，该处工人总结了原有的工具的优点和缺点，力求加以改良。木工四队某组工人为了创造电动截料机，自动出钱购买小电机。谢万福组使用的划线机的效率太低，工人自动进行研究，改善了划线工具；过去只有一等技工才能划线，现在普通工人也能划线了。这个组的工人已经改良工具近二十种，为工程处改良工具最多的单位。
    在改良工具的过程中，各工种间开展了竞赛。划线工创制了划线机，提高效率达五倍，下一个工序的打眼工，眼看着如不改良工具，就不能满足上一个工序的要求了。他们集体创造了手工打眼机，也提高效率五倍，赶上了划线工人。
    为了推动工人改良工具，工程处举行了改良工具的展览会。很多工人参观了展览会，非常感动。新工人郝力下决心要向老工人学习，并订出创造三种工具的计划；现在已经完成一种。领导方面全力支持，及时帮助，及时表扬，对于改良工具的竞赛运动，起了很大的推动作用。为了鼓励工人创造，规定凡是工人为改良工具支出的材料和现款，一律由工程处负担；工人的这种行动，都要受到表扬和鼓励。这样，工人便更加大胆地创造和改良工具了。在改良工具竞赛运动中，领导方面把技术人员组织到运动中去，使他们在理论上帮助工人创造和改良工具，效果很好。                （李干忠）
