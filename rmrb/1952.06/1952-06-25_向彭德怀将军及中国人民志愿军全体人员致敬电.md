    Message of Salute to Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and All Commanders, Fighters, Political Workers, Logistics Workers, Stretcher Bearers, Transport Teams, Railway Transportation Workers, Medical Workers, and Cultural Workers:
    The 25th is the second anniversary of the Korean people's war of resistance against America. Because you have undertaken the sacred task of resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country with voluntary actions, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, achieving a great victory in Korea's war of self-defense, we, the various democratic parties, on behalf of the people of the whole country, extend our cordial greetings and highest respect to you!
    Your victory in this just war has safeguarded the security of the motherland's national defense, preserved the independence of our fraternal neighbor, struck a blow at the American imperialists' arrogant attempt to annex Korea, invade China, dominate Asia, and dominate the world, weakened the crisis of a third world war, and increased the hope for lasting world peace. This is your great contribution to the cause of world peace!
    The American imperialists were forced to accept armistice negotiations as early as last July, but the facts of the past year have fully demonstrated that the enemy still has no sincerity in accepting peace, but is only using negotiations to cover up the war and using war to prolong negotiations. But despite the enemy's use of all卑鄙无耻 means, you and the Korean People's Army have defeated the enemy's conspiracies and tricks, whether in negotiations or on the battlefield. Your infinite patience in striving for peace and your unparalleled heroism in resisting aggression have won new brilliant achievements, making the people of the world more admiring and respectful of you.
    Now the狰狞 face of the American imperialists has been fully exposed. The large-scale use of germ weapons to残害 the peaceful residents of China and Korea, and the大规模屠杀 of unarmed prisoners of war with machine guns and tanks, all these倒行逆施 that violate international conventions and玷辱 human dignity, are precisely说明 the enemy's日暮途穷.
    We firmly believe that the enemy's various sinful acts will surely arouse your义愤 even more, so that you will make persistent efforts and give the enemy even more severe blows. You are the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and you are the most beloved people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the people of the whole country are actively carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, economic construction is constantly developing, national defense construction is becoming increasingly strong, and the strength of the people of the whole country to support you is无穷无尽. We wish you even greater victories in the cause of resisting aggression and defending peace!

    向彭德怀将军及中国人民志愿军全体人员致敬电
    中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员并转全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、担架队员、运输队员、铁路交通工作人员、医务工作人员、文化工作人员同志们：
    二十五日是朝鲜人民抗美战争的两周年纪念日。由于你们用志愿的行动，负起了抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了朝鲜自卫战争的伟大胜利，我们各民主党派谨代表全国人民向你们致亲切的慰问和崇高的敬礼！
    你们在这个正义战争中的胜利，保卫了祖国国防的安全，保全了兄弟邻邦的独立，打击了美帝国主义者并吞朝鲜、侵犯中国、统治亚洲、称霸世界的狂妄企图，削弱了第三次世界大战的危机，增加了世界持久和平的希望。这是你们对全世界人民保卫和平事业的伟大贡献！
    美帝国主义者早在去年七月被迫接受了停战谈判，但一年来的事实充分证明敌人至今尚无接受和平的诚意，只是用谈判来掩饰战争，用战争来拖延谈判。但尽管敌人玩弄尽一切卑鄙无耻的手段，你们和朝鲜人民军无论在谈判中或在战场上都击败了敌人的阴谋诡计。你们争取和平的无限忍耐，抵抗侵略的无比英勇，获得了新的辉煌的成绩，使全世界人民更增加了对于你们的赞誉和敬佩。
    现在美帝国主义者的狰狞面目已全盘暴露了。大量使用细菌武器残害中朝两国的和平居民，用机关枪和坦克大规模屠杀手无寸铁的被俘人员，这种种破坏国际公约、玷辱人类尊严的倒行逆施，正说明敌人的日暮途穷。
    我们坚决相信，敌人的这种种罪恶行为必更激起你们的义愤，使你们再接再厉而予敌人以更严重的打击。你们是中国人民的优秀儿女，是我们最可爱的人。我们的国家在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，经过“三反”、“五反”运动之后，全国人民正在积极开展增产节约运动，经济建设不断发展，国防建设日益强固，全国人民支援你们的力量是无穷无尽的。祝你们在反抗侵略保卫和平的事业上获得更加伟大的胜利！
