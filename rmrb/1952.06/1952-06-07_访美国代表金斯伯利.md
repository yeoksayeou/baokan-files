Visiting American Representative Kingsbury

John Adam Kingsbury, the American representative attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, is already seventy-six years old this year. He was originally a public health worker in New York City, USA, who had been retired for many years. The grave threat to human peace posed by American warmongers led Kingsbury to leave his mountain village and dedicate himself to the cause of world people defending peace. Kingsbury's journey in joining the peace movement is the journey of an ordinary American, growing from a mere observer and sympathizer of peace to a participant in the peace movement. His transformation illustrates the inevitable trend of the world peace cause developing and growing stronger, and war vendors becoming isolated and bankrupt.

Kingsbury first came to know the peace movement at the Pan-American Peace Conference held in Mexico City in September 1949. At that conference, representatives from all over the American continent resolved to unite and fight to defend peace.

Soon after, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held a meeting in Stockholm and issued the Stockholm Appeal, calling on people all over the world to rise up to ban atomic weapons. This declaration was widely disseminated among the American people. The American-Soviet Friendship Association, chaired by Kingsbury, worked to expand the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign, and Kingsbury himself participated in collecting signatures. He said: This was his "first engagement in the cause of world peace."

After the outbreak of the Korean War, the American people increasingly felt the need to establish organizations to promote the peace movement. Many prominent figures in the United States, led by historian Dr. Du Bois, established the Peace Information Center to widely disseminate news of the peace movement to the American people.

However, Dr. Du Bois and the Peace Information Center were persecuted by the US government for advocating peace. When the number of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal in the United States quickly exceeded one million, the US State Department became anxious. Led by Secretary of State Acheson, the State Department launched a campaign of slander and intimidation, falsely claiming that peace activities were "subversive activities" instigated by the Soviet government. Since the US government obviously had no grounds to accuse Du Bois and others of being "agents of a foreign government," it specifically fabricated a charge of acting as "agents of foreign principles," and illegally arrested the old man. The US government's legal persecution and personal humiliation of this respected scholar in his eighties aroused indignation not only in the United States but also among people all over the world. Under the protests of people all over the world, Dr. Du Bois was finally released on bail. When Dr. Du Bois was released from prison, he stood under the statue of President Lincoln, symbolizing the spirit of American democracy, and told reporters: "I am very surprised to realize that I was arrested for something that everyone in the world supports in their hearts - peace!" The persecution of Du Bois sharply showed Kingsbury the suppression and destruction of peace aspirations and human rights in the United States. This deeply educated him.

The Second World Peace Congress decided to convene in Sheffield, England, in the winter of 1950. American peace advocates urged Kingsbury and others to attend. Under the obstruction of the US government, prominent peace leaders such as Robeson, Kent, and Kahn were unable to obtain passports to leave the country. Due to the influence of the US ruling group's distorted propaganda, Kingsbury still had some doubts about the international peace movement at that time. Kingsbury said: He went to England with an attitude of observation, "to see and clarify whether the peace movement was actually controlled by the Soviet Union."

The facts gave him a clear answer.

The American delegation consisted of about sixty people, all peace workers recommended by local labor unions, schools, churches, and mass organizations. When the ship arrived in Sheffield, they found that the British government, under American instructions, was systematically obstructing them. Although the British government had to allow the Peace Congress to be held in Sheffield under the protests of the people, it still used various despicable means to make it impossible for the congress to actually take place. The Soviet delegation, composed of excellent writers and musicians, was refused entry; World Peace Council President Joliot-Curie was refused entry; Kingsbury and others only obtained visas for a two-day stay after repeated negotiations and protests.

While being rejected and expelled by the British government, the peace delegates received an invitation from the People's Democratic Republic of Poland to hold the congress in Warsaw. Warsaw prepared everything in a short period of time and welcomed their arrival.

"It's really a miracle!" Kingsbury exclaimed: "Warsaw arranged the venue with simultaneous translation equipment for various languages in a very short time for the Peace Congress, and prepared everything needed for this conference with two thousand representatives. This is one of the most profound impressions of my life." The different attitudes of the two worlds towards peace deeply touched the old man.

The delegations from various countries personally saw many magnificent buildings rising from the ruins of the war. The great achievements of the Polish people's post-war peaceful construction were convincingly displayed before their eyes. Kingsbury told reporters: "It's really like the myth of Dionysus: 'The phoenix is reborn from the ashes, its golden feathers even more radiant.'"

"Is the peace movement controlled by the Soviet Union?" Kingsbury received a negative answer from the facts he personally experienced. "Two thousand representatives from different countries and different strata of the earth were carefully selected and elected by the people. The presidium of the congress was also discussed and nominated by the delegations themselves, and it was impossible for any external control." The old man said categorically: "This is not a Soviet-controlled drama; this is a spontaneous democratic movement of people all over the world. The people support peace, and the people insist that there must be no Third World War that will destroy humanity."

Kingsbury then introduced his trip to China to reporters.

Last autumn, he went to Paris as a correspondent for an American newspaper to attend the United Nations General Assembly. In November, he participated in the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council. He was originally supposed to return to the United States to preside over the duties of the chairman of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, but his friends in France firmly invited him to spend the winter on the warm southern coast of France. There, he received an urgent telegram from the United States, asking him to represent American peace advocates at the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

"I am very happy to see a brand new civilization rise on the land of China, which I have long yearned for," Kingsbury expressed his feelings after arriving in New China. He said that he had been in contact with the hardworking and kind Chinese people in California when he was a child. Today, coming to New China, he has personally seen that the liberated Chinese people are working wholeheartedly to peacefully build their motherland. He visited the emancipated peasants who are no longer exploited by landlords; he also admired the cultural relics and buildings representing the brilliant culture of the Chinese working people for thousands of years. From these obvious facts, Kingsbury came to the conclusion that Truman's refusal to recognize New China was "ridiculous and wrong." He stood up and emphasized: "I disagree with the policies of the Truman government, and the American people disagree with the policies of the Truman government. I am an American, and I am an American loyal to the traditions of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. I disagree with the policies of this government, not because I am betraying America, but because the government has violated the traditions of America. ... The American president I support must be able to sit down and negotiate, negotiate, negotiate with Stalin, Mao Zedong, and other heads of state to find a path to peace. ..."

Kingsbury summarized his views on peace by saying: "I am an American, and I have nothing to do with the Communist Party. I only advocate peace and hope to see the people of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States develop according to their own wishes and ideals, and I do not want to see human civilization destroyed in the flames of war. I have children and grandchildren, which is why I came to China this time." (Zhang Yinhuai)

    访美国代表金斯伯利
    前来北京出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的美国代表约翰·亚当·金斯伯利，今年已经七十六岁了。他原来是美国纽约市的一个已经退休多年的公共卫生工作者。美国战争挑拨者加给人类和平的严重威胁，使金斯伯利离开山村，投身到世界人民保卫和平的事业中来。金斯伯利参加和平运动的过程，是一个普通美国人，从和平的旁观者、同情者成长为和平运动的参加者的历程。他的转变说明了世界和平事业发展壮大和战争贩子孤立破产的必然趋势。
    金斯伯利第一次认识的和平运动，是一九四九年九月在墨西哥城举行的全美洲保卫和平大会。在那次大会上，来自美洲大陆各地的代表，决心团结起来，为保卫和平而奋斗。
    不久，世界保卫和平大会常设委员会举行了斯德哥尔摩会议，发表了号召全世界人民起来禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言。这个宣言在美国人民中间得到广泛的传布。以金斯伯利为主席的美苏友好协会，曾经为扩大斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动而努力，而金斯伯利也参加征集签名。他说：这是他“第一次从事于世界和平的事业”。
    朝鲜战争爆发后，美国人民日益感到有成立组织来促进和平运动的必要。美国许多著名人士，以历史学家杜波依斯博士为首，成立了和平宣传站，向美国人民广泛传布和平运动的消息。
    但是，杜波依斯博士与和平宣传站却为了和平而受到了美国政府的迫害。当斯德哥尔摩宣言签名人数在美国迅速超过一百万的时候，美国国务院着急了，由国务卿艾奇逊为首，国务院发动了一个污蔑和恫吓的运动，诬称和平活动是苏联政府主使下的“颠覆活动”。由于美国政府显然没有任何根据可以指杜波依斯等人为“外国政府的代理人”，它特别制造了一个所谓充当“外国原则的代理人”的罪名，非法逮捕了这位老人。美国政府对这位八十多岁、受人尊敬的老学者的法律迫害和人身侮辱，激起了不仅美国、而且全世界人民的义愤。在全世界人民的抗议之下，杜波依斯博士终于获得了取保释放。杜波依斯博士出狱时，站在象征美国民主精神的林肯总统的雕像下，向记者们说：“我非常惊奇地认识到：我为了世界上每一个人心中拥护的事情——和平，而被拘捕！”杜波依斯受迫害的情形，向金斯伯利尖锐地表明了和平愿望及人权在美国所受到的压制和摧残。这深深地教育了他。
    第二届世界和平大会决定在一九五○年冬在英国设菲尔德召开，美国拥护和平的人士敦请金斯伯利和其他一些人前去参加。在美国政府的阻挠之下，罗伯逊、肯特和康恩等著名和平领袖都无法领到出国护照。由于美国统治集团歪曲宣传的影响，金斯伯利当时对于国际和平运动还是抱着一些怀疑的。金斯伯利说：他去英国时是抱着观察的态度的，是“去看看，明确一下和平运动倒底是不是苏联控制的”。
    事实给了他明确的回答。
    美国代表团约有六十个人，都是各地工会、学校、教会和群众团体推派出来的和平工作者。船到设菲尔德，他们发现，英国政府正在美国指使之下，有计划地进行着阻挠。虽然在人民的抗议之下，英国政府不得不允许和平大会在设菲尔德举行，但是仍然使用了种种卑劣手段使大会实际上无法开成。由优秀的作家、音乐家组成的苏联代表团被拒绝入境了，世界和平大会主席约里奥—居里被拒绝入境了；金斯伯利等人在几经交涉抗议之后也仅得到停留两天的签证。
    在遭受英国政府的排斥和驱逐的同时，和平代表们却接到了人民民主国家波兰欢迎他们到华沙去举行大会的邀请。华沙在短促的时间内准备好了一切，欢迎他们的到来。
    “这真是个奇迹！”金斯伯利赞叹道：“华沙在很短的时间里为和平大会布置好装有各国语言同时翻译的耳机的会场，为这一个代表人数达二千人的大会准备好了一切需要。这是我毕生最深刻印象之一。”两个世界对待和平的不同态度，使老人感触极深。
    从各国来的代表团亲眼看到从战争废墟上矗立起来的许多巨大建筑。波兰人民战后和平建设的伟大成就令人信服地展示在他们眼前。金斯伯利向记者说：“这真是跟狄奥尼西斯的神话一样：‘凤凰从灰烬里新生，金色的羽毛更加光辉灿烂。’”
    “和平运动是苏联控制的么？”金斯伯利从亲身经历的事实里得到了否定的回答。“二千个来自地球上不同国家、不同阶层的代表，他们都是经过慎重选择、由人民推举出来的。大会主席团也是由各国代表团自己讨论，提名产生的，绝不可能有外界的控制。”老人截然地说：“这绝不是什么苏联控制的戏剧；这是全世界人民自发的民主运动。人民拥护和平，人民坚持决不能有毁灭人类的第三次世界大战。”
    金斯伯利接着向记者介绍了他来中国的经过。
    去年秋天，他到巴黎，以一家美国报纸的通讯员的资格，参加联合国大会。十一月，参加了世界和平理事会维也纳会议。原应该回美国去主持美苏友好协会主席的职务了，然而法国的友人们坚决邀请他到温暖的法国南部海滨去过冬。在那里，他接到了美国来的急电，请他代表美国和平人士出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。
     “我能看到一个崭新的文明，在我久已向往的中国土地上崛起，感觉非常愉快。”金斯伯利这样表达了他到新中国后的感想。他说：他小时在加利佛尼亚州就接触到勤劳和善的中国人民。今天来到新中国，他亲眼看到了获得解放后的中国人民，正在全心全力地为和平建设自己的祖国而努力。他访问了再不受地主剥削的翻身农民；也瞻仰了代表中国劳动人民千百年来灿烂文化的文物和建筑。从这些明显的事实里，金斯伯利得出了一个结论：杜鲁门不承认新中国，是“可笑的和错误的”。他站起来着重地说：“我不同意杜鲁门政府的政策，美国人民不同意杜鲁门政府的政策。我是个美国人，是个忠于华盛顿、杰弗逊、林肯、罗斯福的传统的美国人。我不同意这个政府的政策，并不是背叛美国，而是政府违反了美国的传统。……我所支持的美国总统，必须是能够和斯大林、毛泽东以及其他国家元首坐下来协商、协商、协商、以找出和平道路的人。……”
    金斯伯利归纳他的和平见解说：“我是美国人，和共产党没有关系。我只是主张和平，愿意看到中国、苏联和美国的人民都能够各按他们自己的愿望和理想发展，不愿看到人类文明在炮火中毁灭。我有孩子，也有孙子，这就是我这次为什么到中国来的理由。”    （张荫槐）
