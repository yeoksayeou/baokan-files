    Beijing Private Chongde Middle School Strengthens Teachers' and Students' Current Affairs Learning
    Editor: The reader's letter published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 17, which criticized the phenomenon of middle school students in Beijing not paying attention to current affairs learning, is completely correct. The school's administrative leaders first made a self-criticism regarding this shortcoming, and the teachers also launched a discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the poor results of the high school current affairs test in April were mainly due to the school's leadership neglecting ideological guidance. Although the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has established a system for organizing current affairs learning in various middle schools, we did not pay enough attention to students' current affairs learning. We conducted some investigations and research on students' ideological situation, but it was not in-depth enough. Therefore, our planned current affairs learning program was divorced from reality and did not suit the needs of the students.

    In order to correct the above serious errors, we have initially improved our current affairs learning methods. First, we feel that correcting teachers' attitudes towards current affairs learning is the key to guiding students to do well in current affairs learning. Therefore, we require all faculty and staff to listen to current affairs broadcasts, read newspapers and current affairs magazines on time, formulate study plans, conduct self-study and group discussions, and conduct regular tests. In addition, we mobilized some teachers to draw various charts to assist all teachers and students in current affairs learning. We have decided to strengthen the current affairs and policy curriculum, conduct systematic explanations of major domestic and foreign events, and have class teachers lead each class's newspaper reading group; we formulate review outlines every week and hold tests every two weeks. These methods have been implemented for two weeks, and the enthusiasm of teachers and students for learning current affairs has generally increased, and test scores are better than before. In the future, we must do a better job in current affairs learning.

### 北京市私立崇德中学加强师生的时事学习

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市私立崇德中学加强师生的时事学习
    编辑同志：五月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的读者来信，对北京市中等学校学生不注意时事学习的现象提出批评，这一批评是完全正确的。我校行政领导方面对这种缺点，首先作了检讨，教师们也展开了讨论。大家一致认为，四月份高中时事测验成绩很差，主要原因在于学校负责人员忽视思想领导。虽然北京市文教局订出了各中等学校组织时事学习的制度，但是我们并没有重视学生的时事学习问题。我们对学生的思想情况，做过一些调查研究，但很不深入。因此，我们拟定的时事学习计划脱离了实际，不适合同学们的需要。
    为了纠正上述严重错误，我们已初步改进了时事学习的办法。首先，我们感到端正教师对时事学习的态度，是领导学生搞好时事学习的关键。因此，我们规定全体教职员按时收听时事广播，阅读报纸和时事杂志，订出学习计划，进行自学和分组讨论，并定期测验。此外，我们发动部分教师，绘制各种图表，以辅助全校师生进行时事学习。我们决定加强时事政策课程，对国内外重大事件进行系统的讲解，并由级任教员领导各班的读报小组读报；每周拟定复习提纲，每两周举行一次测验。这些办法已经实行了两个星期，师生学习时事的情绪普遍提高，测验成绩较前为好。今后，我们一定要把时事学习搞得更好。
