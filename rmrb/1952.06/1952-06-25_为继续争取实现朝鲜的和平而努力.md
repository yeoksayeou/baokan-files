The Korean people's War to Resist America and Defend the Country has reached its second anniversary today; the Korean armistice negotiations aimed at a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue have also been underway for nearly a year. Although the American aggressors are still desperately delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to maintain a state of war in Korea and continue to create international tensions, the victorious development of the Korean people's war against America and the world's people's struggle to defend peace has destined the inevitable failure of the American aggressors.

The past two years of the Korean War to Resist America have proven that the arrogant and domineering American aggressors, who dream of annexing the world, can be defeated. Only by resolutely resisting the war adventures of the American aggressors can the peace-loving people of the world realize their desire to maintain peace.

The American aggressors were initially unwilling to admit their defeat. After suffering heavy blows from the Chinese and Korean people and being forced to accept Korean armistice negotiations last July, they continued to clamor about their "air superiority" and "America's relentless military pressure." They attempted to seize more than 12,000 square kilometers of Korean territory at the armistice negotiation table under the pretext of so-called "compensation for air superiority," while launching their so-called "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive" on the battlefield, attempting to force us to submit. However, the aggressors' "air superiority" has been greatly shaken due to the growth of the air power of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. All their "offensives" on the ground have yielded nothing but heavy casualties. Former commander of the American invading forces in Korea, Ridgway, admitted in a closed-door meeting of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on May 21st that "the United Nations forces themselves are not capable of launching new offensives against the Communists."

In the Korean people's war against America, the Chinese and Korean people's forces fighting side by side have gradually grown into a powerful force for defending peace. The reason why the Chinese and Korean people's forces are becoming stronger and stronger is that they are waging a just war against aggression, and have received the full spiritual and material support of the people of both countries and the peace-loving people of the world. Although the Korean people have suffered deep war disasters, they still use all their strength to help the troops at the front. The Chinese people have also contributed all necessary manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the Chinese and Korean people's forces. The fact that 3,710 fighter planes were donated in the donation of weapons movement alone fully demonstrates the lofty internationalist spirit and patriotic enthusiasm of our people. On the enemy's side, however, because they are waging an unjust war of aggression, soldiers are war-weary, air force personnel are "refusing to fly," sources of troops are drying up, vassal states are becoming alienated, and internal disputes are becoming increasingly difficult to quell. At the same time, the economic difficulties and decline in the living standards of the people caused by the arms race have led to a series of strikes. In particular, the recent major strike by American steelworkers has seriously affected American military production. All this clearly illustrates an important fact: the aggressors' difficulties are increasing day by day.

In order to salvage their miserable failure, the American aggressors have used poison gas on the Korean battlefield and have waged a heinous germ warfare against China and Korea since January of this year. But all these inhumane crimes are merely proof of the aggressors' futile struggles. The Chinese and Korean people have adopted strict epidemic prevention measures and launched a powerful hygiene and epidemic prevention campaign, initially eliminating and will continue to eliminate the germ-carrying pests spread by the American aggressors on Chinese and Korean soil. The American aggressors cannot but face the vigorous protest movement of the peace-loving people of the world, and cannot but face the final judgment of justice.

People know that the American war of aggression against Korea was originally a step in its preparations to attack China, and then to annex Asia and dominate the world. However, the victorious war of resistance against aggression by the Chinese and Korean people has caused the American aggressors to be battered and bruised, and the true form of its outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger has been fully exposed before the people of Asia and the world. This has made the American war group even more unpopular and rejected by mankind; this has further encouraged the victorious confidence of the people of oppressed countries in their struggle for independence and liberation. The Korean war of resistance against aggression has become a great victorious banner for the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace.

All the struggles of the American aggressors are desperate and hopeless. In the process of the Korean armistice negotiations for nearly a year, the U.S. side has exhausted all kinds of shameless means to delay and sabotage. Now, only the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war remains in the armistice negotiations. However, after their absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation" was completely bankrupt and they were rendered speechless, the American aggressors have further sabotaged the armistice negotiations by means of cowardly methods such as large-scale massacres, "screening," and unilateral handling of prisoners of war, as well as unreasonable provocative actions of continuously avoiding meetings.

In order to strive for the early realization of the Korean armistice, our side has made the greatest efforts in the armistice negotiations, and most of the issues in the negotiations have been agreed upon. Regarding the resolution of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, our side has also put forward the most practical and fair plan, which is: all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides (Chinese People's Volunteers or United Nations forces) should be repatriated; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides (Korean People's Army or South Korean Army) whose families are in the other side's area should be fully repatriated, and those whose families are in the receiving side's area should be allowed to return home on the spot without repatriation. This plan not only fully conforms to the spirit of the Geneva Convention, but is also the only reasonable, realistic, and correct plan. People can see that our side's position of striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is just, sincere, and firm. If the U.S. side can change their unreasonable attitude, abandon their absurd claim of attempting to forcibly detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, and accept our side's fair plan for resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue, the Korean armistice can be realized immediately, and political negotiations can begin immediately. Otherwise, the American aggressors will absolutely not be able to escape their responsibility for sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations.

Now, the people of the world are launching extensive and powerful activities to strive for peace in Korea and strengthen the struggle to defend world peace. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has passed a resolution designating June 25 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace, calling on working men and women around the world to actively support the heroic Korean people, demanding a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis, demanding that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, and demanding the prohibition of bacteriological weapons and condemnation of the American aggressors' crimes of using bacteriological weapons and massacring prisoners of war. The Women's International Democratic Federation has also issued the same call to women around the world. These active actions of the people of the world to support Korea and strive for peace are undoubtedly a powerful pressure to force the American aggressors to accept a just peace.

On the second anniversary of the Korean War, we, the Chinese people, will continue to work hard to achieve peace in Korea. We will continue to launch the movement to increase production and practice economy on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, and support the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces with greater strength. We fully support the fair and reasonable plan for resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue put forward by our negotiators, and resolutely oppose the American aggressors' crimes of persecuting and massacring our captured personnel and their evil conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel and unilaterally handle prisoners of war. In order to force the brutal and shameless enemy to accept a just peace, we must continue to work hard to oppose bacteriological warfare, realize the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, and conclude a peace pact among the five great powers. Now, the enemy is facing a dead end in Korea. We must unite more closely with the people of the world, further strengthen the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea, thoroughly expose and attack the U.S. side's conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, and crush all attempts by the United States to prolong and expand the war, so as to achieve peace in Korea and the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea.

The heroic Chinese and Korean People's armies have fought bravely and brilliantly in the two years of the Korean War and have achieved great victories, making extremely important contributions to the struggle to defend world peace. Their heroic example has encouraged and will continue to encourage the people of all countries who are fighting to defend peace and strive for independence and liberation. The hearts of all righteous people in the world are yearning for them; let us unite more closely, struggle forward!

### 为继续争取实现朝鲜的和平而努力

    为继续争取实现朝鲜的和平而努力
    朝鲜人民的抗美卫国战争进行到今天已经两周年了；为谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的朝鲜停战谈判也进行了将近一年。虽然美国侵略者在目前依然穷凶极恶地拖延与破坏朝鲜停战谈判，妄图在朝鲜继续保持战争状态，继续制造国际紧张局势，但是朝鲜人民抗美战争和全世界人民保卫和平斗争的胜利发展形势，却已注定了美国侵略者的必然失败的命运。
    两年来的朝鲜抗美战争证明：骄横霸道、妄想吞并世界的美国侵略者是可以被打败的。世界爱好和平人民对美国侵略者的战争冒险只有实行坚决的抵抗，才能实现维护和平的愿望。
    美国侵略者曾经是不肯承认他们的失败的。在遭受到朝中人民的沉重打击而于去年七月被迫接受朝鲜停战谈判之后，它还不断叫嚣他们的“空中优势”和“美国的无情的军事压力”。他们曾经一面在停战谈判的会议上，妄图以所谓“空中优势的补偿”为藉口，而夺取朝鲜的一万二千余方公里的土地；一面在战场上发动其所谓“夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”，企图迫使我方屈服。但是，侵略者的“空中优势”由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军空中力量的生长而大大动摇了，他们在地面上的一切“攻势”，除了付出惨重的伤亡代价之外，一无所得。前任美国侵朝军总司令李奇微在本年五月二十一日美国参议院军事委员会秘密会议上作证时，不得不承认：“联合国军自己现在不能够对共产党发动新攻势”了。
    在朝鲜人民的抗美战争中，并肩战斗的朝中人民部队，已逐渐成长为保卫和平的强大力量。朝中人民部队的力量所以愈战愈强，是由于他们进行的是反侵略的正义战争，获得了两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民精神上和物质上的全力支援。朝鲜人民虽然遭受了深重的战争灾难，但仍以自己所有的力量帮助前线的军队作战。中国人民为支援朝中人民部队也贡献了一切必需的人力、物力和财力。单是在捐献武器运动中就献出了三千七百一十架战斗机，这一事实充分表现了我国人民崇高的国际主义精神和爱国热情。而在敌人的方面，由于他们所进行的是非正义的侵略战争，因而士兵厌战，空军人员
    “罢飞”，兵源枯竭，附庸国家离心离德，内部争吵越来越无法平息；同时由于扩军备战所造成的经济上的困难和人民生活水平的下降，罢工运动此起彼伏，尤其是最近期间美国钢铁工人的大罢工，严重地影响了美国的军备生产。这些都清楚地说明了一个重要的事实，那就是：侵略者的困难在与日俱增。
    为了挽救他们的悲惨失败，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上曾经使用过毒气，并自今年一月以来，对朝中两国进行了万恶的细菌战。但是这一切灭绝人性的罪行，只不过是侵略者徒劳的挣扎的证明而已。朝中人民采取了严密的防疫措施，开展了强大的卫生防疫运动，初步扑灭了并将继续扑灭美国侵略者在中国和朝鲜土地上撒布的带菌毒虫。而美国侵略者却不能不面对着全世界和平人民的如火如荼的抗议运动，不能不面对着正义的最后的审判。
    人们知道，美国侵略朝鲜的战争，原是它准备进攻中国，进而吞并亚洲和独霸全世界的一个步骤。然而，朝中人民胜利的反侵略战争却使美国侵略者碰得头破血流，它这个外强中干的纸老虎的原形在亚洲和全世界人民面前完全暴露出来了。这就使美国战争集团更加众叛亲离，更加为人类所唾弃；这就更加鼓舞了被压迫国家人民争取独立解放斗争的胜利信心。朝鲜反侵略战争已经成为全世界人民为保卫和平而斗争的一个伟大胜利的旗帜。
    美国侵略者的一切挣扎都是绝望的、没有出路的。在朝鲜停战谈判将近一年的过程中，美方耍尽了各种无耻的手段从事拖延和破坏。现在，停战谈判只剩遣返战俘一个问题了。但是美国侵略者在他们“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张遭到彻底破产并理屈辞穷之后，竟以大规模屠杀、“甄别”和片面处理战俘等卑怯手段，以及连续逃避开会的无理挑衅行动，来进一步破坏停战谈判。
    我方为了争取朝鲜停战的早日实现，在停战谈判中曾作了最大的努力，而使谈判中的大部分问题获得了协议。对于解决战俘遣返问题我方也提出了最切合实际的公平方案，这就是：双方所俘获的外国武装人员（中国人民志愿军或联合国军）应全部遣返；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员（朝鲜人民军或南朝鲜军）其家在对方地区者应全部遣返，其家在收容方面地区者，得许其就地回家，不必遣返。这个方案不但完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神，而且是唯一合情合理的实事求是的正确方案。人们可以看出：我方争取和平解决朝鲜问题的立场是公正的真诚的和坚定的。如果美方能够改变他们的无理态度，放弃他们企图强迫扣留我方十万以上被俘人员的荒谬主张，接受我方解决战俘遣返问题的公正方案的话，朝鲜停战便可立即实现，政治谈判也便可立即开始了。否则，美国侵略者便绝对逃不脱他们破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任。
    现在，全世界人民正为争取朝鲜的和平与加强保卫世界和平的斗争展开了广泛有力的活动。世界工会联合会执行局已通过决议，将六月二十五日定为国际声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日，号召全世界的劳动男女积极声援英勇的朝鲜人民，要求在公正合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，并要求禁止细菌武器和谴责美国侵略者使用细菌武器与屠杀战俘的罪行。国际民主妇联对全世界妇女也发出了同样的号召。全世界人民这种积极支援朝鲜、争取和平的行动，无疑是迫使美国侵略者接受公正和平的强大压力。
    在朝鲜战争两周年的时候，我们中国人民将继续为争取实现朝鲜的和平而努力。我们将在“三反”“五反”斗争胜利的基础上，继续展开增产节约运动，以更大的力量支援英勇的朝中人民部队。我们完全支持我方谈判代表所提出的解决战俘遣返问题的公平合理的方案，并坚决反对美国侵略者迫害、屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行和企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员、片面处理战俘的罪恶阴谋。为了迫使凶残无耻的敌人接受公正的和平，我们更要继续为反对细菌战、实现禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书和缔结五大国和平公约而努力。现在，敌人在朝鲜已面临穷途末路了，我们一定要和全世界人民团结一致，进一步加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争，彻底揭露和打击美方拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋，粉碎美国延长和扩大战争的一切企图，而取得朝鲜的和平与抗美援朝的最后胜利。
    英勇的朝中人民军队在两年来的朝鲜战争中进行了勇敢的、光辉的战斗，并取得了伟大的胜利，对保卫世界和平的斗争作了极其重要的贡献。他们的英雄榜样，已经鼓励了并将继续鼓励着为保卫和平、争取独立解放而斗争的各国人民。全世界正义人民的心都向往着他们；让我们更加紧密地团结一致，奋斗前进！
