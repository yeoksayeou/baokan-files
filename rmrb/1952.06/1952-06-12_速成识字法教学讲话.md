The third lecture: Learn phonetic symbols and pinyin, master the "crutches" for literacy

The first step in quick literacy teaching is to carry out ideological mobilization work, followed by the second step—teaching phonetic symbols. Phonetic symbols are the main tool for quick literacy, and the soldiers call them the "crutches" for literacy.

The general process of teaching phonetic symbols is: (1) First, spend a few minutes teaching a song (such as "Cultural Great Leap Forward"), this song is an old tune with new lyrics, simple and easy to learn. Lead the singing three times to teach it. After learning the song, further mobilize, explaining that as long as you concentrate, you can achieve quick success; (2) Start teaching phonetic symbols, following the principle of "from easy to difficult," breaking the old formula of teaching phonetic symbols, starting with the relatively easy to learn "一" (yī), "ㄨ" (wū), "凵" (qū); and explain that learning the phonetic symbol "一" (yī) will allow you to recognize the "衣" (yī) in clothes, the "益" (yì) in benefit, the "义" (yì) in meaning, the "毅" (yì) in Chen Yi’s name… proving that phonetic symbols are easy to learn and very useful. Then teach the consonants that can be pronounced independently, such as "ㄓ" (zhī), "彳" (chì), "尸" (shī), "ㄖ" (rì), etc., and finally teach the vowels. The more difficult ones such as "ㄞ" (āi), "?", "幺" (yāo), "又" (yòu), "ㄣ" (ēn), "ㄤ" (āng), "ㄥ" (ēng), "ㄋ" (n), "ㄌ" (l) should be taught several times. In this way, it only takes thirty or forty minutes to teach all the phonetic symbols, and the students can read them in unison; (3) Cut the phonetic symbol table apart and practice "moving house" in mutual aid groups until all the phonetic symbols can be pronounced separately.

Pay attention to the following when teaching phonetic symbols:

    1. Teachers should promote the spirit of democratic teaching, using words and sounds familiar to the students to connect with phonetic symbols to help students remember. For example, the relatively difficult to remember "?", the students connect it to the "?" sound shouted by Sichuan workers when carrying stones, "Heave-ho (? - hé yō), heave-ho (? - hé yō)!" and it becomes easier to remember. Another example is that some students say that "ㄞ" (āi) is a rib (ㄌ - l) with a line on top, read with the "ài" sound, which is also easier to remember.

    2. Start practicing the phonetic symbol "moving house." The general difficulty is "inaccurate moving," because the writing of some phonetic symbols is not very different, such as "ㄌ" (l) and "ㄞ" (āi), "ㄘ" (cī) and "ㄎ" (k), which are often easily confused, and the more the learners move, the more confused they become. Therefore, when moving, emphasize "see the target clearly and aim accurately." Secondly, practicing "moving house" while recognizing and gesturing (do not require dictation) can also help with memory. In addition, some students compile phonetic symbols into sentences, which is also very effective.

    3. When teaching phonetic symbols, do not emphasize standard pronunciation. It is impossible and unnecessary to ask students to turn their dialects into Beijing dialect in a short period of time. For example, Sichuan people do not distinguish between "ㄋ" (n) and "ㄌ" (l), and Cantonese people pronounce ㄓ (zhī), 尸 (shī), 彳 (chì), 卩 (jié) ㄘ (cī) 厶 (sī) all as ㄐ (jī) ㄑ (qī) ㄒ (xī), it is not necessary to correct them, because the sounds they spell are consistent with their dialects. To solve the problem of dialects, some units have adopted the method of "regional representatives," selecting a better one from the students with Sichuan, Shanxi... accents to demonstrate reading to everyone, so that students from various provinces can find the "standard" and avoid confusion due to the different pronunciations of each other.

    4. Students who are afraid to read aloud often become "dead corners" in teaching. Because they dare not read aloud, it is difficult for the teacher to accurately grasp their pronunciation, and even if there are mistakes, it is difficult to correct them. Therefore, on the one hand, the teacher should take the lead in demonstrating with their full spirit, teaching loudly and reading loudly; on the other hand, the few students who dare not read aloud should be persuaded and corrected in time.

When the vast majority of students can pronounce all the phonetic symbols accurately, start teaching pinyin. The process of teaching pinyin is roughly: (1) first teach single pinyin, pronounce the phonetic symbol as it is; (2) then teach double pinyin, first select some familiar words, explain the essentials of pinyin, practice repeatedly, and after mastering the rules of pinyin, try to spell new words. The essentials of double pinyin are generally "the first sound is light and short, the second sound is heavy, and the two sounds collide quickly." If the first sound is read heavily, "勹丫" (bā) is often read as "勹ㄛ丫" (b-o-ā), and the result is that it cannot be spelled out; if the second sound is read long, "勹丫" (bā) is read as "勹丫——" (bā-ā), often only one "丫" (ā) is spelled out, the two sounds are not connected, and after spelling for a long time, they are still two sounds, which cannot be put together; (3) teach three pinyin, first practice with familiar words, figure out the essentials, and then spell new words. The essentials of three pinyin are generally "first spell the first and second sounds, and use the sound spelled out by the first and second sounds to spell the third sound." The difficulty of three pinyin is often: "The first and second sounds are spelled out, but the third sound is forgotten; when the third sound is remembered, the first and second sounds that were just spelled are forgotten." The way to overcome this is to memorize the syllables in three pinyin that combine consonants and medial vowels (such as 勹一 (bi), 勹ㄨ (bu), etc., a total of thirty-two).

Finally, pay attention to the following points when spelling:

    1. When teaching pinyin, explain the essentials first. Some units have adopted the method of leading the reading of the "Pinyin Table," and as a result, although the students read "勹丫八" (bā) as familiarly as the Three Character Classic, they still cannot spell. Or, spell according to the pinyin under the Chinese characters; if the characters are not recognized, they will not be able to spell either.

    2. Not daring to boldly affirm the sound is a relatively common phenomenon in the initial stage of pinyin, for example, the student has already spelled "攵丫" (pà) as "pà", but still continues to "攵丫" (pà). To overcome this, some units have adopted the method of "you spell, I listen, I spell, you listen, half the people spell, half the people listen"; some have adopted the "sudden stop" method, such as spelling three or four times, and then quickly stopping, shouting three times to spell it out. Some units have also discovered that students often spell out "丫" (ā) when spelling "攵丫" (pà); therefore, it is stipulated that they are not allowed to say "丫" (ā), but they are required to say a sound that is similar to "丫" (ā), which easily induces "pà".

    3. The issue of the four tones should not be overemphasized. The difference between the four tones can be resolved in "word linking and reading." For example, "迂 (yū), 鱼 (yú), 雨 (yǔ), 遇 (yù)" are all annotated with the same "凵" (ü) character. It is not easy to distinguish the four tones when reading them separately, but when they are linked into "迂回 (yū huí)," "打鱼 (dǎ yú)," "下雨 (xià yǔ)," and "遭遇 (zāo yù)," the meaning of the words is very obvious, and there will not be too much deviation.

    4. When starting to teach pinyin, do not proceed too quickly, and take into account that although students can "move house" with the phonetic symbols they have learned, they are not very proficient yet. When teaching pinyin, emphasize "accuracy," generally the reason for spelling incorrectly is often that the phonetic symbols are not pronounced accurately, especially the vowels.

In this learning stage, students must be required to accurately memorize all the phonetic symbols and master the pinyin, so that they can smoothly start the next step—attacking new characters. It is the most intense step in the quick literacy teaching process. (End of this lecture, the whole article is not finished)

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第三讲  学会注音符号和拼音，掌握识字的“拐棍儿”
    速成识字教学的第一个步骤是进行思想动员工作，紧接着就要进行第二个步骤——教学注音符号。注音符号是速成识字的主要工具，战士称之为识字的“拐棍儿”。
    教注音符号的一般过程是：（一）先用三几分钟教会一只歌子（如“文化大翻身”等），这歌子是旧调新词，简单易学，领唱三遍就能教会。学会歌子以后，就作进一步的动员，说明只要思想集中就能速成；（二）开始教注音符号，按照“由易到难”的原则，打破教注音符号的老公式，先从比较容易学的“一”“ㄨ”“凵”教起；并说明学会了注音符号“一”字，就会认衣服的“衣”、利益的“益”，意义的“义”、陈毅将军的“毅”……证明注音符号容易学，用处又大。然后再教能单独发音的声符，如“ㄓ”“彳”“尸”“ㄖ”等，最后教韵符，比较难的“ㄞ”“?”“幺”“又”“ㄣ”“ㄤ”“ㄥ”、“ㄋ”“ㄌ”等应多教几遍，这样只需三四十分钟的时间，即可把全部注音符号教完，学员也能齐读；（三）把注音符号表剪开，在互助组里练习“搬家”，直到能把全部注音符号分开念。
    教注音符号要注意下面几件事：
    一、教员应发扬民主教学的精神，用学员熟悉的字、音来联系注音符号，以帮助学员的记忆。如比较难记的“?”，学员把它联系到四川工人抬石头喊“?——卩ㄨ?、?——卩ㄨ?”的“?”字，就好记了。又如有的学员把“ㄞ”说成肋巴骨（ㄌ）上加一个杠子，读“嗳”的声音，也比较容易记。
    二、开始练习注音符号“搬家”。一般的困难是“搬不准”，这是因为有些注音符号的写法差别不大，如“ㄌ”和“ㄞ”、“ㄘ”和“ㄎ”，往往容易混淆起来，学的人越搬越乱。因此，搬的时候要强调“看清目标，瞄准射击”。其次，练习“搬家”时，边认边比划（不要要求默写），也能帮助记忆。此外，有的学员把注音符号编成句，收效也不小。
    三、教注音符号，不能强调标准音。要求学员在短期内，把自己的方言变成北京话，这是不可能、也是不必要的。如四川人“ㄋㄌ”不分，广东人把ㄓ尸彳、卩ㄘ厶都读成ㄐㄑㄒ，可以不必纠正，因为这样读，拼出来的音和他的方言是一致的。为解决方言问题，有些单位曾经采用过“区域代表”的办法，从四川、山西……口音的学员中，选择一个较好的，示范读给大家听，使来自各个省份的学员都能找到“标准”，避免因彼此的读法不同，而互相纠缠不清。
    四、不敢大声读的学员，在教学中往往变成“死角”。因为他不敢大声地读，教员就很难摸准他的读法，即使有读错的地方，也很难予以纠正。因此，一方面，教员要以自己饱满的精神，带头示范，大声教，大声读；另一方面，对少数不敢大声读的学员，应即时说服纠正。
    到绝大多数学员能把全部注音符号读准时，就开始教拼音。教拼音的过程大体是：（一）先教单拼音，注音符号是啥就念啥；（二）再教双拼音，先选一些熟字，讲明拼音要领，反复练习，等摸熟了拼音的规律，再试拼生字。双拼音的要领，一般是“前音轻短、后音重，两音相连猛一碰”。假使把前音读重了，往往把“勹丫”读成“勹ㄛ丫”，结果就拼不出来；后音读长了，把“勹丫”读成“勹丫——”，往往只拼出一个“丫”来，两个音不相连，拼半天还是两个音，凑不到一块去；（三）教三拼音，先用熟字练习，捉摸要领，然后再拼生字。三拼音的要领，一般是“先拼一二音，用一二音拼出来的音，再跟第三音拼”。三拼音的困难常常是：“一二音拼出来了，第三音又忘了；等把第三音想起来，刚才拼的一二音又忘了”。克服的办法，可以把三拼音中声符、介符结合在一起的音节（如勹一、勹ㄨ等，共三十二个），教学员背熟。
    最后，拼音要注意下面几点：
    一、教拼音，要先讲明要领。有些单位，曾经采用领读“拼音表”的办法，结果学员虽然把“勹丫八”念得和三字经一样熟，可是仍然不会拼。或者，照着底下的汉字拼音；如果字不认得，也就不会拼了。
    二、不敢大胆肯定音，是拼音初期比较普遍的现象，例如学员已经把“攵丫”拼出个“怕”来了，但还一股劲的“攵丫”下去。克服的方法，有的单位采用“你拼我听、我拼你听，一半人拼、一半人听”的办法；有的采用“猛一停”的办法，如拼上三、四遍后，就赶快停下，大喊三声就拼出来了。有的单位还摸索到：学员在拼音中，往往把“攵丫”拼出“丫”来；因此规定不准他说“丫”，但要求说出一个和“丫”相差不多的音，就很容易诱导出
    “怕”来了。
    三、四声问题，不应过多地去讲求。四声的差别，可以放到“词儿连读”中解决。例如“迂、鱼、雨、遇”，都用一个“凵”字注音。分开来读，不易区别四声，但连成“迂回”、“打鱼”、“下雨”、“遭遇”之后，词意就很明显，不会出太大的偏差。
    四、开始教拼音，进度不要太快，应照顾到学员学的注音符号虽能搬家，可是还不很熟练。教拼音时，要特别强调“准确”，一般拼得不对的原因，往往是把注音符号读的不准，特别是韵符不准。
    在这个学习阶段中，一定要要求学员把注音符号全部记准，拼音拼熟，这样才能很顺利地开始下一个步骤——突击生字。它是速成识字法教学过程中最紧张的一个步骤。（本讲完，全文未完）
