Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team Writes to Chairman Gao Gang
Guaranteeing to Increase Production and Save Over 1,300 Tons of Grain

Chairman Gao Gang:

In order to respond to your great call for increasing production and practicing economy, based on our existing achievement of 44.95 meters per day, we have formulated our own action plan. From May to the end of the year, we guarantee to send an additional 880 meters of main roadway beyond the completion of the annual plan, which means producing an additional 10,560 tons of coal. And from late May, we will eliminate uphill inclined chutes, switch to single-hole tunneling, and learn from the advanced tunneling methods of the Soviet Union's Golovin to reduce production costs. The plan is to increase production and save a total of 1,398 tons of grain for the country.

We clearly understand that increasing production and saving one pound of grain is equivalent to manufacturing one more bullet for the Volunteer Army; at the same time, we deeply realize that whether our lives can be improved is directly determined by whether we can complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. We will definitely unite more closely, give full play to our high labor enthusiasm, use our wisdom to find tricks, and strive to complete the plan for increasing production and practicing economy!

### 崔国山掘进队给高岗主席写信  保证增产节约一千三百多吨粮食

    崔国山掘进队给高岗主席写信
    保证增产节约一千三百多吨粮食高岗主席：
    为了响应你伟大的增产节约号召，我们在日进四十四点九五公尺的既有成绩基础上，制订了自己的行动计划，从五月份到年底，保证在完成年度计划之外，多送八百八十公尺大巷，即多生产煤一万零五百六十吨。并自五月下旬起取消上山顺槽，改用单孔掘进，学习苏联郭洛温的先进掘进方法，以降低生产成本，计划总计为国家增产节约一千三百九十八吨粮食。
    我们清楚地了解到多增产节约一斤粮食，就等于为志愿军多制造一颗子弹；同时也深刻地体会到自己的生活能否提高，是直接由我们能否完成增产节约任务来决定的。我们一定更紧密地团结在一起，发挥高度劳动热情，运用智慧找寻窍门，为完成增产节约计划而奋斗！
