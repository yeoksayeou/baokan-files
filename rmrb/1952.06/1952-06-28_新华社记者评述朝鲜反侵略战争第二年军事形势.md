Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th – This agency's front-line correspondent's assessment of the military situation in the second year of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression: In the second year of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers continued to achieve great victories in ground battles and air defense operations, further inflicting serious losses on the enemy's strength, technical equipment, and war materials. From June 26, 1951, to June 15, 1952, for more than eleven months, the Korean and Chinese People's armies eliminated more than 325,000 enemy troops (including more than 129,900 American invading troops), shot down or damaged more than 5,900 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged more than 900 enemy tanks and armored vehicles.

In the second year of the War of Resistance Against Aggression, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers conducted active defensive operations along the line spanning the central part of the Korean Peninsula, thwarting multiple key offensives and frequent small-scale incursions by the American invading forces and their accomplice troops, achieving victories of killing large numbers of enemies at a small cost. From June to October 1951, the American aggressors successively launched frantic key offensives in areas north of Yangkou in the east, west of Tieyuan in the west, and south of Jincheng in the central region. In each of the key offensives, the enemy used a massive force of 19 divisions, approximately 300,000 men in total, deployed almost all the tanks and artillery groups of the U.S. military invading Korea, and had a large number of aircraft cooperate in the operation. This was what Ridgway and Van Fleet touted as the "Summer Offensive" and "Autumn Offensive." The heroic and resourceful Korean and Chinese People's forces met and crushed the enemy's key offensives with ease, annihilating a large number of enemy troops. According to statistics, in the four months from June 26 to the end of October, the invading enemy forces suffered approximately 200,000 casualties, and all they gained was a northward advance of a few kilometers in local areas. The disastrous failure of the American aggressors' key offensives led Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, to desperately lament: "It will take Ridgway at least twenty years to reach the Yalu River!" After crushing the enemy's autumn offensive, the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a series of powerful counterattacks against the enemy in the west and central sectors in November, annihilating many companies and platoons of American invading troops and British accomplice troops in areas such as Ma Liang Mountain and Yuji Mountain. In the same month, our coastal defense forces also carried out amphibious operations, recovering several islands off the west coast of North Korea that had been occupied by the American-Syngman Rhee bandit army. Since then, for more than six months, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have been repelling frequent small-scale enemy incursions every day, and constantly using flexible tactics such as fortification assaults, raids, counterattacks, and sniping to eliminate enemy strength.

In the past year of intense and fierce fighting, the face of the front line has undergone major changes. The commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese People's armies, with extraordinary perseverance and tremendous labor, have built extremely solid defensive fortifications, linking hundreds of miles of mountain positions into a steel defense line. The gradually growing Korean and Chinese People's artillery forces are increasingly becoming an important combat force in the war of resistance against aggression, accurately and fiercely inflicting heavy casualties on a large number of enemies on the front line every day.

In the second year of the War of Resistance Against Aggression, the Korean and Chinese People's armies greatly strengthened their air defense capabilities. In addition to the powerful anti-aircraft artillery forces, the Chinese People's Volunteers have also begun to establish a brave and excellent air force, inflicting heavy blows on American air pirates. After the complete failure of the American air force's so-called "strangulation war" attempting to cut off the transport supply lines of the Korean and Chinese People's armies, it adopted the so-called "key raid" tactic starting in April this year, but still suffered even heavier blows from the Korean and Chinese People's air defense forces.

While overcoming the threat of enemy air force, the logistics units of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers gave full play to collective wisdom and a high degree of hard work, carrying out large-scale road and bridge construction and organizational work to improve transportation efficiency. During the rainy season in July and August last year, the fighters on the logistics front bravely overcame one of the biggest floods in Korea in decades. Afterwards, they overcame the difficulties of winter wind and snow, supplying the front-line combat troops with sufficient food, ammunition, and equipment.

The American aggressors, who suffered serious military defeats, brazenly carried out extremely cruel large-scale bacteriological warfare at the beginning of 1952. The Korean and Chinese People's armies immediately formed a large army against bacteriological warfare with the broad masses of the Korean people, taking various emergency and effective measures to control the occurrence of epidemics. In the past five months, the Korean and Chinese People's armies and the Korean people have further improved epidemic prevention and hygiene conditions, achieving initial victories and experience in the anti-bacteriological warfare. At the same time, the American aggressors, who had repeatedly used poison gas in the past, planned to carry out chemical warfare on the front lines in February this year, continuously using poison gas shells and poison gas bombs. The Korean and Chinese People's armies have fully implemented measures to defend against poison gas, and will certainly be able to defeat the enemy's chemical warfare just like defeating the enemy's bacteriological warfare.
The facts of the second year of the Korean War show that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are an invincible force, and its basic advantages – the justice of the war, high morale, strong reserve forces, correct military guiding principles, the unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and the support of the people of the world – are playing an increasingly significant positive role in the war. The technical equipment of the Korean and Chinese People's armies is also constantly improving. On the contrary, the insurmountable fundamental difficulties of the American aggressors, such as insufficient troops, low morale, and internal contradictions within the aggressive bloc, have become more serious as the war progresses, and their temporary advantage in technical equipment is gradually being relatively weakened. People can foresee that the situation in the third year of the Korean War will be even more unfavorable for the American aggressors and their accomplice troops.

    新华社记者评述朝鲜反侵略战争第二年军事形势
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】本社前线特派记者对朝鲜反侵略战争第二年军事形势的评述：在朝鲜反侵略战争第二年中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在地面战斗和对空作战中继续取得了伟大胜利，使美国侵略军及其帮凶军的有生力量、技术装备和战争物资进一步遭到严重损失。自一九五一年六月二十六日到一九五二年六月十五日的十一个多月中，朝中人民军队共歼灭敌军三十二万五千多名
    （其中美国侵略军占十二万九千九百多名），并击落击伤敌军飞机五千九百多架，击毁击伤敌军战车和装甲车九百多辆。
    在反侵略战争第二年中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在横贯朝鲜半岛中部的战线上进行积极的防御作战，粉碎了美国侵略军及其帮凶军多次重点进攻和频繁的小股窜犯，以小的代价取得杀伤大量敌人的胜利。一九五一年六月到十月，美国侵略者先后在东线杨口以北、西线铁原以西和中线金城以南地区发动疯狂的重点进攻。敌军在各次重点进攻中，总计使用了十九个师约三十万人的庞大兵力，几乎出动了侵朝美军所有的战车和炮群，并有大量飞机配合作战。这就是李奇微和范佛里特叫嚣的
    “夏季攻势”和“秋季攻势”。英勇机智的朝中人民部队应付裕如地迎击和粉碎了敌军各次重点进攻，歼灭了大量敌军。据统计，六月二十六日到十月底的四个多月中，进犯敌军共约伤亡二十万名，而其所得的只是在局部地区向北推进了几公里。美国侵略者重点进攻的悲惨失败，使美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷绝望地哀鸣：“李奇微至少要用二十年才能达到鸭绿江！”朝中人民部队粉碎敌军秋季攻势以后，即于十一月间在西线和中线向敌军进行一连串的强力反击，在马良山、鱼积山里等地歼灭了许多成营成连的美国侵略军和英国帮凶军。同月内，我海防部队也进行渡海作战，在北朝鲜西部沿海收复了为美李匪军盘踞的若干岛屿。在此以后到目前的六个多月中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军每天都击退敌军频繁的小股窜犯，并不断地以攻坚、袭击、反击、狙击等各种灵活的战术手段消灭敌军有生力量。
    在过去一年紧张、激烈的战斗中，战线的面貌已经发生重大变化。朝中人民军队的指挥员、战斗员们以超人的毅力和巨大的劳动，构筑了极其坚固的防御工事，已使纵横数百里的山岭阵地联成一条钢铁防线。逐渐壮大的朝中人民炮兵部队，日益成为反侵略战争中的重要战斗力量，每天在战线上准确而猛烈地杀伤大量敌人。
    在反侵略战争第二年中，朝中人民军队大大地加强了对空作战力量。除了强大的高射炮部队以外，中国人民志愿军并已开始建立了一支勇敢而优秀的空军，使美国空中强盗遭受了沉重的打击。美国空军妄图切断朝中人民军队运输供应线的所谓“绞杀战”宣告彻底失败以后，在今年四月起又采取了所谓“重点突袭”的战术，但仍然遭到朝中人民对空作战部队更为沉重的打击。
    在战胜敌人空军威胁的同时，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的后勤部队发挥集体的智慧和高度的艰苦奋斗精神，大规模地进行了道路桥梁的修建工作和提高运输效率的组织工作。在去年七、八月的雨季中，后勤战线上的战士们英勇地战胜了朝鲜数十年来最大的一次洪水。以后，他们又克服了冬季风雪的困难，以足够的粮食、弹药和装备供应前方作战部队。
    在军事上遭到严重失败的美国侵略者，一九五二年初竟悍然大规模地进行极端残酷的细菌战。朝中人民军队当即与广大的朝鲜人民组成一支反细菌战的大军，采取各种紧急而有效的措施，控制了疫病的发生。五个月来，朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民已进一步改进防疫卫生状况，取得了反细菌战的初步胜利和经验。与此同时，过去曾经屡次使用毒气的美国侵略者，又在今年二月份有计划地在前线进行化学战，连续施用毒气炮弹和毒气炸弹。朝中人民军队已经充分地进行了防御毒气的措施，一定能像打败敌人细菌战一样地打败敌人化学战。
    朝鲜战争第二年的事实表明：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军是不可战胜的力量，它的基本优势——战争的正义性、高昂的士气、雄厚的后备力量、正确的军事指导方针、中朝人民的团结和世界人民的声援等因素，对战争起着日益显著的积极作用。朝中人民军队的技术装备也正在不断改善。与此相反，美国侵略者兵力不足、士气低落、侵略集团内部矛盾等不可克服的根本困难，已随着战争时间的延长而更趋严重，其技术装备上的暂时优势则正逐渐遭到相对的削弱。人们可以预料，朝鲜战争第三年的形势，对于美国侵略军及其帮凶军来说，将是更加不利的。
