Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 27th: At the Korean armistice negotiation between both sides delegations on the 27th, the U.S. side's chief representative, Major General Harrison, once again unilaterally adjourned the meeting for three days and walked out of the meeting. At the meeting on the 27th, our side's chief representative, General Nam Il, listed the facts of the other side's complete violation of the Geneva Convention in his speech, pointing out that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved according to the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal to repatriate prisoners of war to their homes to live a peaceful life fully complies with the Geneva Convention and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue. The other side cannot defend its April 28th proposal to detain prisoners of war, but once again absurdly distorts the Soviet army's ultimatum to the besieged enemy during World War II, attempting to find a basis for the other side's claim to detain prisoners of war. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that the Soviet Union strictly abided by the Geneva Convention and repatriated the prisoners of war it had accommodated, which is a well-known fact and cannot be distorted. The other side claims to represent fifteen signatories to the Geneva Convention, but why does it violate the clear provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war after the armistice? Why does it violate the clear provisions of the Geneva Convention that prisoners of war shall not declare their renunciation of repatriation rights under any circumstances? General Nam Il finally pointed out that the other side's repeated unilateral announcements of adjournment can only show the other side's lack of justification. The other side must remember that it has no power to unilaterally decide the conditions for the armistice, and the issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved on the basis of equal consultation and in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention. Any move to interrupt the normal course of the meeting is completely unreasonable. Our side resolutely cannot agree. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:
	"Currently, only the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is hindering the armistice in Korea, and everyone knows that there is only one internationally recognized international convention for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, which is the 1949 Geneva Convention. Your side's insistence on a prisoner of war detention plan that completely violates the Geneva Convention can only show that your side is unwilling to reach an armistice in Korea. The 1949 Geneva Convention stipulates that the personality of prisoners of war must be respected, but your side forces prisoners of war to tattoo, write blood letters, and take fingerprints. The Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war must be treated humanely, but your side persecutes and massacres prisoners of war. The Geneva Convention stipulates that all prisoners of war must be repatriated after the armistice, but your side openly advocates the detention of prisoners of war. The Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war shall not declare renunciation of repatriation rights under any circumstances, but your side is conducting so-called 'screening' aimed at depriving prisoners of war of their repatriation rights. The people of the world will never forgive your side's bloody crimes on Koje Island. The people of the world will never allow your side to brazenly tear up the Geneva Convention and attempt to detain prisoners of war after the armistice. Our side insists that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in the Korean armistice negotiations must be resolved in accordance with the principles of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to immediately return home to live a peaceful life, fully complies with the Geneva Convention and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue. Your side cannot deny that your April 28th plan to detain prisoners of war is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. Your side is attempting to force our side to accept your unreasonable plan to detain prisoners of war by threatening us with 'continued war losses'. I must frankly tell you that your arrogant and naive threat can only show the unreasonableness and fragility of your position and cannot have any effect on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Your side should clearly remember that your side once attempted to achieve unreasonable demands in the negotiations through so-called military pressure and launched a military adventure. However, when your side's attempts were met with a head-on blow, and you could no longer 'continue to endure war losses', your side returned to this tent to continue negotiations. Unless your side deliberately delays the armistice negotiations and is determined to expand the Korean War, your side has no reason to refuse to accept our May 2nd proposal as the basis for resolving the prisoner of war issue and quickly achieving the Korean armistice."

    二十七日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    我方再斥美方违反日内瓦公约
    美方又片面休会三天中途退出会场 【新华社开城二十七日电】二十七日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，美方首席代表哈利逊少将又一次片面休会三天，中途退出会场。二十七日的大会上，我方首席代表南日将军在发言中列举对方彻底违反日内瓦公约的事实，指出：战俘遣返问题必须根据一九四九年日内瓦公约的原则求得解决，我方遣返战俘回家过和平生活的五月二日方案，完全符合日内瓦公约，是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础，对方无法辩护企图扣留战俘的对方四月二十八日方案，却又一次荒谬地歪曲第二次世界大战中，苏联军队对被围的敌军的最后通牒，妄图为对方扣留战俘的主张寻找根据。南日将军严词指出：苏联严格遵守日内瓦公约，遣返它所收容的战俘，是举世周知的事实，不容任何歪曲。对方自称代表着十五个日内瓦公约的签字国，却为什么违反日内瓦公约关于停战后遣返战俘的明白规定？为什么破坏日内瓦公约关于战俘不得在任何情况下声明放弃遣返权利的明白规定？南日将军最后指出：对方一再片面宣布休会，只能表现对方的理屈词穷。对方必须记得对方没有任何权力独断地决定停战的条件，战俘遣返问题必须在平等协商的基础上根据日内瓦公约的原则求得解决。任何中断会议正常进行的举动，是完全没有道理的。我方坚决不能同意。南日将军主要发言如下：
     “目前只有一个战俘遣返问题阻碍着朝鲜的停战，而谁都知道世界上只有一个公认的解决战俘遣返问题的国际公约，那就是一九四九年的日内瓦公约。你方坚持彻底违反日内瓦公约的扣留战俘的方案，只能说明你方不愿达成朝鲜停战。一九四九年日内瓦公约规定，必须尊重战俘的人格，但你方对战俘强迫刺字，写血书，打手印。日内瓦公约规定必须予战俘以人道待遇，但你方迫害与屠杀战俘。日内瓦公约规定停战后遣返全部战俘，但你方公然主张扣留战俘。日内瓦公约规定战俘不得在任何情况下声明放弃遣返权利，但你方进行旨在剥夺战俘遣返权利的所谓‘甄别’。全世界人民将永远不会饶恕你方在巨济岛上充满着血腥的罪恶行为。全世界人民将永远不会容许你方悍然撕毁日内瓦公约，在停战后扣留战俘的荒谬企图。我方坚持朝鲜停战谈判中的战俘遣返问题，必须根据一九四九年日内瓦公约的原则求得解决。我方五月二日方案，使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活，完全符合日内瓦公约，是解决战俘遣返问题唯一合理的基础。你方不能否认你方四月二十八日扣留战俘的方案是彻底违反日内瓦公约的。你方却妄图以‘继续遭受战争损失’为威胁，强使我方接受你方扣留战俘的无理方案。我必须坦白地告诉你，你方这种狂妄幼稚的威胁，只能表示你方立场的无理和脆弱，而不能对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发生任何作用。你方应该清楚记得，你方曾经一度妄图以所谓军事压力达成你方在谈判中所不能实现的无理要求，发动了军事冒险。但是，当你方的尝试遭到了迎头痛击，不能‘继续忍受战争损失’的时候，你方就又回到这一帐篷里来，继续进行谈判。除非你方蓄意拖延停战谈判，决心扩大朝鲜战争，你方就没有任何理由拒绝接受我方五月二日方案为基础解决战俘问题，迅速实现朝鲜停战。”
