Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th - At the plenary session of the delegation of both sides of the Korean Armistice Talks on the 6th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that it is a recognized common sense and fully in line with humanitarian principles and the clear provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention that after the armistice, the commanders of both sides should repatriate all prisoners of war under their custody to the other side. General Nam Il enumerated the multiple efforts made by our side to resolve the issue of prisoners of war on a reasonable basis, proposing a compromise plan on March 27 to ensure that prisoners of war on both sides could immediately return home to live a peaceful life. However, the other side not only never made any concessions but also went back on its word, overturning its explicit expression of willingness to resolve the issue within the framework of our plan, using our side's sincerity in negotiating a solution as a pretext for the other side to arbitrarily detain our captured personnel, insisting on the absurd and illegal plan to detain prisoners of war. General Nam Il vehemently denounced the other side's shameless lies about "humanitarian principles" and "individual rights," pointing out that the other side must withdraw its plan to detain prisoners of war, which is in complete violation of the Geneva Convention. The main contents of General Nam Il's two speeches are as follows:

General Nam Il's Speech One:

"Only the issue of prisoners of war is hindering the Korean armistice, and the responsibility for the failure to resolve the issue of prisoners of war and the protracted armistice negotiations lies entirely with your side. During wartime, the belligerent parties each captured the military personnel of the other side. After the armistice, the belligerent parties should hand over all the captured personnel of the other side under their custody to the other side. In the military conference held by the commanders of both sides, there is only one solution to the issue of prisoners of war: that is, the commanders of both sides are responsible for repatriating all the captured personnel of the other side under their custody to the other side. This is recognized common sense, fully in line with humanitarian principles and the war practices and international laws of the past two hundred years. The 1949 Geneva Convention, which you yourselves signed, clearly stipulates that after the armistice, the commanders of both sides must repatriate all prisoners of war under their custody to the other side. This is a self-evident truth, beyond dispute. It is only because the number of prisoners of war held by your side is slightly more than the number held by our side that you spare no effort to create various pretexts, at the expense of violating human common sense and conscience, violating the war practices and international laws of the past two hundred years, and violating the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War of 1949, which you yourselves signed, especially the clear provisions of this convention regarding prisoners of war not being allowed to waive the right to repatriation, in an attempt to detain our captured personnel to serve as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. Your assertion has no reason, no precedent, and no legal basis, and is therefore intolerable to any belligerent party on an equal footing. In order to achieve an armistice in Korea and resolve the issue through consultation on a reasonable basis, our side has made a series of concessions on the issue of prisoners of war. Your side originally had no reason to oppose the unconditional and complete repatriation of prisoners of war on both sides after the armistice, but in order to dispel your pretext that the armistice should not increase the military strength of both sides and thus oppose complete repatriation, our side suggested on February 3 that the commanders of both sides guarantee that their captured personnel would live a peaceful life after repatriation and no longer participate in war actions. Your side originally had no reason to illegally classify our captured military personnel as 'civilians,' but in order to negotiate a solution, our side agreed to temporarily set aside the issue of dealing with this part of our captured personnel and suggested on March 21 that the principle of complete repatriation of prisoners of war be determined on the basis of the list of prisoners of war exchanged by both sides on December 18, 1951. This was a major effort made by our side to resolve the issue of prisoners of war. Your side also publicly acknowledged this at the time and repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve the issue within the framework of our proposal of March 21. In order to ensure that the captured personnel of both sides can immediately return home to live a peaceful life after the armistice, and at the same time to reach an agreement within the framework of our proposal of March 21, our side suggested on March 27 that your side repatriate all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and all captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who live in our area. Our side repatriates all captured personnel of the United Nations forces and all captured personnel of the South Korean army who live in your area. Captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who live in your area and captured personnel of the South Korean army who live in our area, if they wish to immediately return home to live a peaceful life after the armistice, may not be repatriated. According to this principle, our side suggested entering the corrected list. Our principle of March 27 guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can immediately return home to live a peaceful life after the armistice. This is an absolutely reasonable principle, fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Convention, and at the same time a major concession to your side, and a true compromise principle. The record of this series of efforts made by our side to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoners of war on a reasonable basis cannot be altered by any malicious distortion or fabrication. However, since the discussion of the issue of prisoners of war, your side has not made any substantial concessions. Your side has gone back on its word and has actually treated our side's expression of sincerity in negotiating a solution as a pretext for your side to arbitrarily detain our captured personnel, and put forward your absurd plan of April 28 to detain our captured personnel. Your side has been talking nonsense at this meeting that our side has suggested that your side conduct a 'screening'. Who suggested that your side conduct a 'screening'? I tell you that all your nonsense about 'screening' and 're-screening' is utter nonsense to our side. The problem is that your side agreed to resolve the issue within the framework of our proposal of March 21, but you turned around and refused to recognize it, and carried out forced detention. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers absolutely cannot tolerate your inhuman and perfidious behavior. After doing this, you still have the face to come to this meeting to talk about 'good faith,' talk about 'humanitarian principles,' talk about 'individual rights.' One example of your 'good faith' is that what your spokesman, Colonel Hickman, said on March 25 was completely worthless by April 19. Your 'humanitarian principle' is the principle of detaining and slaughtering prisoners of war. Your 'individual right' is to persecute prisoners of war and deprive them of their right to go home. Your ability to reverse right and wrong and pretend to be good has really developed to an alarming degree. The current dispute over the issue of prisoners of war is whether to repatriate prisoners of war or to detain prisoners of war. Your side insists on detaining our captured personnel, and our side insists on not allowing you to detain our captured personnel. This is the essence of the dispute in this tent. And outside this tent is your continued slaughter of our captured personnel. Our side firmly opposes your slaughter of our captured personnel. If you still want to hold your head up in front of the people of the world, you must immediately stop your cowardly act of slaughtering our captured personnel. If you still want an armistice in Korea, your side must withdraw the April 28 plan, which is a blatant and complete violation of the Geneva Convention. The issue of prisoners of war must be resolved on the legal basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention. In order to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoners of war, our side has made many major efforts and put forward a compromise plan on May 2 that fully conforms to the spirit of the Geneva Convention. Our side firmly and unshakeably believes that this is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoners of war, and the future of the Korean armistice negotiations lies entirely with your side."

General Nam Il's Speech Two:

"The basic principles of the Geneva Convention are that all prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the armistice, and that they should be treated humanely during the period of detention. Our proposals and our treatment of prisoners of war, including the policy of releasing prisoners of war at the front during the war, are fully in line with the Geneva Convention. Your side advocates the forced detention of prisoners of war, and has consistently persecuted and slaughtered prisoners of war. Your side's assertions and actions are a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. You cannot fail to recognize these facts. The absurd assertions fabricated by your side, which cannot be found in any basis in the convention, cannot improve your fundamentally untenable position in the slightest. The people of the whole world know which side has implemented the true 'humanitarian principle' for prisoners of war and firmly safeguarded the rights of prisoners of war; which side has violated all 'humanitarian principles' and attempted to deprive prisoners of war of their basic rights; who bombed and strafed the other side's prisoner of war camps with airplanes, killing their own captured personnel; who cut off the prisoners of war's food; who has been constantly slaughtering prisoners of war like livestock with bayonets, machine guns, flamethrowers, and tanks; who has attempted to deprive prisoners of war of their right to go home to live a peaceful life, and attempted to detain them in South Korea and Taiwan, endangering their lives. Your side has no right to put forward 'humanitarian principles' and 'individual rights'. You only have the obligation to immediately stop the cowardly act of slaughtering prisoners of war and abandon the illegal assertion of detaining prisoners of war. In order to deceive the people, you repeat your lies every day, saying that you cannot force prisoners of war to return home with bayonets, but the fact before people is that you are detaining prisoners of war with bayonets. You repeat your lies every day, saying that you cannot put handcuffs and shackles on prisoners of war and drive them home like livestock. But the fact before people is that our captured personnel, regardless of the threat of your machine guns, flamethrowers, and tanks, firmly oppose your side's absurd assertion of detaining our captured personnel, and you are slaughtering our captured personnel every day like slaughtering livestock. You repeat your lies every day, saying that prisoners of war will endanger their lives when they go home, but the fact before people is that your side is trying not to let them return to their own homes to live a peaceful life, to send them to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder, and even try to exile them to the Mariana Islands and Saipan, which truly endangers their lives. Your side is trying to avoid holding regular meetings to cover up your conspiracy to slaughter prisoners of war and detain prisoners of war, and continue to delay the armistice negotiations. Our side firmly disagrees. I suggest that we meet as usual tomorrow at the usual time."

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我方痛斥美方扣留战俘荒谬方案
    【新华社开城六日电】六日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出，停战后，双方司令官将他们收容下的战俘，全部遣返另一方，是公认的常识，完全符合于人道的原则，是一九四九年日内瓦公约的明确规定。南日将军列举我方为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘问题所作的多次努力，在三月二十七日提出保证双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活的折衷方案。但对方不但从未作任何让步，反而背信弃义，推翻愿在我方方案轮廓内解决问题的明确表示，以我方为了协商解决问题的诚意，作为对方肆意扣留我方被俘人员的藉口，坚持扣留战俘的荒谬非法方案。南日将军痛斥对方所谓“人道原则”、所谓“个人权利”的无耻谎言，指出对方必须撤回彻底违反日内瓦公约的扣留战俘的方案。南日将军两个发言的主要内容如下：
    南日将军发言之一：
    “阻碍朝鲜停战的只有一个战俘问题，战俘问题之所以未能解决，停战谈判之所以长期拖延，其责任完完全全在于你方。战争时期交战双方各自俘虏了对方的军事人员，停战后交战双方就应该将他们收容的对方被俘人员全部交与对方。在双方司令官举行的军事会议中，战俘问题只有一个解决办法。即：双方司令官负责将他们收容的对方被俘人员全部遣返对方，这是公认的常识，完全符合于人道的原则和两百年来的战争惯例和国际法规。你方自己签了字的一九四九年的日内瓦公约，都明明白白规定了停战之后双方司令官必须把他们所收容的全部战俘遣返对方，这本是自明的道理，无可争辩。只是由于你方收容的战俘比我方收容的多了一些这个简单的事实，你方就不惜千方百计制造各种藉口，不惜违反人类的常识和良心，违反两百年来的战争惯例和国际法规，违反一九四九年你们自己签了字的日内瓦战俘公约，特别是这个公约关于战俘不得放弃遣返权利的明确规定，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当蒋介石与李承晚的炮灰。你们这种主张是没有任何道理，没有任何前例，没有任何法律根据的，从而也是任何处于平等地位的交战一方所不能容忍的。为了实现朝鲜的停战，在合理的基础上，经由双方的协商解决问题，我方在战俘问题上作了一系列的让步。你方本来没有任何理由反对双方在停战后无条件地全部遣返对方被俘人员，但为解除你方以停战不得增加双方军事力量从而反对全部遣返的藉口，我方在二月三日建议双方司令官保证其被俘人员在遣返后过和平生活，不再参加战争行动。你方本来没有任何理由将我方的被俘军事人员非法地分类为‘平民’，但我方为了协商解决问题，同意将这部分我方被俘人员的处理问题暂置一边，在三月二十一日建议以一九五一年十二月十八日双方所交换的战俘名单为基础，确定全部遣返战俘的原则。这是我方为了解决战俘问题所作的一项重大努力。你方当时也曾公开承认这点，并且一再表示愿意在我方三月二十一日提案的轮廓内解决问题。为了保证双方被俘人员得以在停战后立即回家过和平生活，同时为了在我方三月二十一日提案的轮廓内达成协议，我方在三月二十七日建议你方遣返全部中国人民志愿军被俘人员和全部家住我方地区的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。我方遣返全部联合国军的被俘人员和全部家住你方地区的南朝鲜军被俘人员。家住你方地区的朝鲜人民军被俘人员和家住我方地区的南朝鲜军被俘人员，如在停战后愿立即回家过和平生活者，可以不予遣返。根据这个原则我方建议进入校正名单。我方三月二十七日的原则保证双方战俘得以在停战后立即回家过和平生活，这是一个绝对合理的原则，完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神，同时又是对你方的一个重大让步，是一个真正的折衷原则。为了在合理的基础上协商解决战俘问题，我方所作的这一系列努力的记录，不是任何恶意歪曲和捏造所能窜改的。但自从讨论战俘问题以来，你方没有作过任何实质的让步，你方背信弃义，竟然把我方为了协商解决问题的诚意表示，当作你方肆意扣留我方被俘人员的藉口，提出了你方四月二十八日扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬方案。你方在这个会上信口胡说我方建议过你方进行‘甄别’。谁建议过你方进行‘甄别’？我告诉你，你们一切关于‘甄别’与‘再甄别’的胡说，对我方说来都是彻底的废话。成为问题的是你方同意了在我方三月二十一日提案的轮廓之内解决问题，但你们竟反过脸来不认账，实行强迫扣留。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军绝对不能容许你们这种伤天害理背信弃义的行为。你们这样做了，竟然还有脸来到这个会上谈什么‘善良诚意’，谈什么‘人道原则’，谈什么‘个人权利’。你们的‘善良诚意’之一例，就是你方发言人希克曼上校在三月二十五日讲了的话，到了四月十九日就完全不算数。你们的‘人道原则’就是扣留与屠杀战俘的原则。你们的‘个人权利’就是迫害战俘与剥夺他们回家的权利。你们颠倒是非假冒为善的本领，真是发展到惊人的程度。目前对战俘问题的争执是遣返战俘或者是扣留战俘。你方坚持扣留我方被俘人员，我方坚持不容许你们扣留我方被俘人员，这就是这一个帐篷里争论的实质。而在这一个帐篷外边则是你方继续屠杀我方被俘人员。我方坚决反对你们屠杀我方被俘人员。如果你们还要在世界人民面前抬起头来，你们必须立即停止屠杀我方被俘人员的卑怯行为。如果你们还要朝鲜的停战，你方就必须撤回公然彻底违反日内瓦公约的四月二十八日方案。战俘问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的合法基础上求得解决。为了协商解决战俘问题，我方已经作了多次重大努力，提出了五月二日完全符合日内瓦公约精神的折衷方案。我方坚决不可动摇地认为这是解决战俘问题的唯一合理基础，朝鲜停战谈判的前途完全在于你方。”
    南日将军发言之二：
    “日内瓦公约的基本原则就是全部战俘应在停战后立即释放与遣返，以及应在被收容期间受到人道待遇。我方提案与我方对战俘的待遇，包括在战争期间前线释放战俘的政策，是完全符合日内瓦公约的。你方主张强迫扣留战俘，并一贯迫害与屠杀战俘，你方的主张和行为，是彻底违反日内瓦公约的。你们无法不承认这些事实，你方捏造的在该公约中找不到任何根据的荒谬主张，丝毫不能改善你们的根本站不住的立场。全世界人民都知道是那一方对战俘执行了真正的‘人道原则’，坚决地维护着战俘的权利；是那一方违反了一切的‘人道原则’，企图剥夺战俘的基本权利；是谁用飞机轰炸扫射对方的战俘营，打死自己的被俘人员；是谁断绝战俘的粮食，是谁用刺刀、机关枪、喷火器、坦克不断地将战俘当作牲口一般地屠杀着他们；是谁企图剥夺战俘回家过和平生活的权利，企图扣留他们在南朝鲜和台湾，危害他们的一生。你方没有任何资格提出‘人道原则’，和‘个人权利’，你们只有立即停止屠杀战俘的卑怯行为，放弃扣留战俘的非法主张的义务。你们为了欺骗人民每天重复你的撒谎，说你们不能用刺刀强迫战俘回家，但摆在人们面前的事实，是你们正在用刺刀扣留战俘。你们每天重复你们的撒谎，说你们不能将战俘加上手铐脚镣，像赶牲口一样赶他们回家。但摆在人们面前的事实是我方被俘人员，不顾你方的机关枪、喷火器和坦克的威胁，坚决反对你方扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，是你们每天像屠杀牲口一样在屠杀我方被俘人员。你们每天重复你们的撒谎，说什么战俘回家就要危害他们的生命，但摆在人们面前的事实是你方企图不让他们回到自己家里过和平生活，要把他们送给李承晚、蒋介石当炮灰，甚至企图把他们流放到马利安纳群岛和塞班岛，这才真正的危害了他们的生命。你方企图逃避经常开会来掩盖你方屠杀战俘和扣留战俘的阴谋，继续拖延停战谈判，我方坚决不同意。我建议明天通常时间照常开会。”
