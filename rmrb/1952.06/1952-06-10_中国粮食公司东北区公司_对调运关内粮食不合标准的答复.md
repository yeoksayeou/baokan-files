    Northeast China Company of the China National Grain Corporation
    Reply Regarding Substandard Grain Transferred from Within the Border

    Editor: The March 17th issue of the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published a letter from Yang Xuezhong of the Chahar Province Chanan Grain Bureau and the Jining Branch of the China National Grain Corporation, raising concerns about the substandard quality of corn transferred from Northeast China to within the border. After seeing this letter, our company immediately sent personnel to investigate. We believe that the high moisture content of Northeast corn is a fact. Last year, some areas of Northeast China experienced spring droughts, and many corn seedlings withered and died. After replanting, the corn's growing season was shortened, and continuous autumn rains during the dough stage led to higher moisture content. This was not due to our carelessness during the acquisition process or other reasons. However, we did not provide detailed information about the quality of grain in Northeast China in advance, and we should be held accountable for this.

### 中国粮食公司东北区公司  对调运关内粮食不合标准的答复

    中国粮食公司东北区公司
    对调运关内粮食不合标准的答复
    编辑同志：三月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了察哈尔省察南粮食局杨学忠与中国粮食公司集宁分公司的来信，对东北调运到关内的玉米不合标准的情况提出意见。我公司看到此信后，立即派员进行调查。我们认为，东北玉米含水量大是事实。去年东北某些地区春旱，许多玉米小苗枯死。补种以后，玉米生长期缩短，加以定浆时秋雨连绵，以致所含水分较大。这并不是由于我们在收购时粗枝大叶，也不是其他原因。但我们事先没有详细介绍东北粮食质量情形，这是应作检讨的。
