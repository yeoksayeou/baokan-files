An introduction to the Chinese edition, issue 146, of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers’ Parties’ organ, "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!"

Issue 146 has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial titled "Stop the Atrocities of the American Imperialists," denouncing the crimes of American imperialism in massacring prisoners of war on Koje Island.

This issue contains an article by Zhankov, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, entitled "The Victory of Socialist Construction in the People's Republic of Bulgaria." Zhankov said: On May 11, 1952, the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party announced a decision on currency reform, abolition of food rationing, and reduction of state retail prices. This is a major event in our country's history, but it is not sudden; our domestic economy and culture have always been advancing rapidly. Industrial production in 1951 was nearly four times the level of 1939. The Five-Year Plan stipulated that the proportion of heavy industry in industry should increase from 30 percent in 1946 to 44.6 percent by the end of 1953, but in 1951, the proportion of heavy industry had already reached 43 percent. Agriculture has also made great progress; socialist competition continues to unfold under the leadership of the Party. Zhankov also said: Bulgaria's currency reform, the abolition of food rationing, and the reduction of retail prices have created more conditions for completing the 1952 economic plan and completing the Five-Year Plan in four years (that is, this year). The main task put forward by the Party and the government to the people in 1952 is to ensure the increase in industrial output. This year's industrial output will be 16.5 percent higher than the level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1953. Another important task is to expand the exploration of natural resources in order to lay the foundation for the domestic production of liquid fuels and ensure the rapid development of our own metallurgy industry. A particularly important task stipulated in the 1952 plan is to further strengthen agricultural cooperatives, state farms, and machinery and tractor stations organizationally, economically, and politically, so as to ensure that the people get better food and greatly increase the output of technical crops.

This issue also contains an article by Aqi, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party: "Work Experience of Party Groups of the Hungarian Working People's Party." Aqi said: In the struggle to consolidate the Party's ranks and improve its quality, an important weapon in the hands of lower-level Party organizations is the actively working Party group. The Party's leading organs rely on these lower-level links to maintain close and direct contact with every Party member. In the autumn of 1951, the Politburo passed a resolution on electing new Party group leaders and reorganizing Party groups. The newly elected Party group leaders were all Party members who had outstanding achievements in production, Party education, and social work. At the same time, Party groups were also reorganized according to the principles of production (workshops, sections, work groups). These types of Party groups have played a major role in striving to complete national production and deliver public grain. The Party groups' struggle to strengthen labor discipline and national discipline is of particular importance. The best Party groups have carried out systematic education work among new workers, which is very important because the tens of thousands of new workers who have come to factories, state farms, and machinery and tractor stations are mainly from rural areas, and those who participate in production cooperatives are basically individual farmers of yesterday, and they have not yet abandoned harmful prejudices and backward ideas. Party group leaders and Party groups, with their exemplary work in production, have set living examples for non-Party workers, inspiring more workers to follow their example. Party groups strive to enable their members and non-Party workers to actively participate in socialist competition. The best Party groups mainly use the method of skillfully organizing mass political work to continuously increase labor productivity.

This issue contains an article by Emile Burns, a member of the Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain: "The British People Fight for Peace." The article states: The British Peace Conference held on May 18 shows that a wider and wider range of British people are supporting the various peace proposals put forward by the British Peace Committee and the World Peace Council. Millions of British people are gradually realizing that the peace movement is the true defender of British freedom and British independence. The British people's anger at American aggressive policies and their hostility towards American occupation forces are setting off a genuine patriotic movement united under the banner of peace.

This issue contains "The Struggle of the Khmer and Lao Peoples for National Independence" written by Zhanyin and Kantai, which introduces in detail the situation of the people's struggle in the two countries. This issue also contains a speech by Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, at an election rally in Rome: "Strive to Unite All Democratic Forces in Italy."

### “争取持久和平，争取人民民主”中文版第一四六期介绍

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主”中文版第一四六期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四六期已经出版。
    本期发表题为“制止美国帝国主义者的暴行”的社论，斥责了美帝国主义在巨济岛虐杀战俘的罪行。　本期刊载了保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员詹科夫所作题为“保加利亚人民共和国社会主义建设的胜利”的文章。詹科夫说：一九五二年五月十一日，保加利亚部长会议与共产党中央委员会公布了关于币制改革、废止食物配给及减低国家零售价格的决定。这是我们国家历史上的一件大事，但这并不是突如其来的，我们国内的经济和文化始终在突飞猛进着。一九五一年的工业生产将近一九三九年水平的四倍。五年计划规定重工业在工业中的比重到一九五三年年底应从一九四六年的百分之三十提高到百分之四十四点六，但是在一九五一年，重工业的比重已达到百分之四十三了。农业方面也获得了很大的发展；社会主义竞赛在党的领导下不断展开。詹科夫又说：保加利亚的币制改革、废止食物配给、及减低物品的零售价格，已为完成一九五二年经济计划和在四年内（就是在今年）完成五年计划创造了更多的条件。党和政府向人民提出的一九五二年的主要任务是保证工业产量的增加，今年工业产量将比五年计划为一九五三年规定的水平高百分之十六点五。另一重要任务是为了奠定液体燃料国内生产的基础和保证我们自己的冶金业的迅速发展而扩大天然资源的探测。一九五二年计划所规定的一个特别重要任务，是在组织上、经济上和政治上进一步加强农业合作社、国营农场和机器与拖拉机站，从而保证人民得到更好的食物，并大大增加技术作物的产量。
    本期还刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会候补委员阿契的文章：“匈牙利劳动人民党党小组的工作经验”。阿契说：在巩固党的队伍和提高其质量的斗争中，下级党组织手中一个重要武器就是积极工作的党小组，党的领导机构就靠这些下级环节和每一个党员保持密切的直接的联系。一九五一年秋季，政治局通过了一个关于选举新的党小组长和改组党小组的决议，新选出来的党小组长都是在生产方面、在党的教育工作和社会工作中有卓越成绩的党员。同时党小组也根据生产原则（车间、工段、工作组）进行改组。这类党小组在争取完成国家生产和缴纳公粮的工作中起了很大作用。党小组进行的加强劳动纪律和国家纪律的斗争有特别重要的意义。最好的党小组都在新工人中间进行了有系统的教育工作，这工作是很重要的。因为到工厂及国营农场和机器拖拉机站的成千成万的新工人主要是从乡村来的，参加生产合作社的人基本上也是昨天的个体农民，他们还没有放弃有害的偏见和落后的见解。党小组长和党小组以他们的生产方面的示范性的工作，为非党工人树立了活的榜样，使更多工人效法他们。党小组努力使它们的组员和非党工人积极参加社会主义竞赛。最好的党小组主要用熟练地组织群众政治工作的办法，来使劳动生产率不断提高。
    本期刊载了英国共产党政治委员会委员艾米尔·本斯的文章：“英国人民为和平而斗争。”文章说：五月十八日举行的英国和平会议表明：英国各阶层越来越广泛地拥护英国和平委员会和世界和平理事会所提出的各项和平建议。千百万英国人民逐渐认识到和平运动是英国自由与英国独立的真正的卫护力量，英国人民对美国侵略政策的愤怒，对于美国占领军的敌视，正在掀起一个团结在和平大旗下的真正的爱国运动。　本期刊载了战音和堪台所写的“高棉和寮国人民争取民族独立的斗争”，详细介绍了两国人民斗争的情况。本期还刊载了意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂在罗马竞选集会上的演说：“为团结意大利的一切民主力量而奋斗”。　（新华社）更正
