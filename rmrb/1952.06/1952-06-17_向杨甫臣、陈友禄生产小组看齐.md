    Learn from the Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu Production Groups
    Today, this newspaper published the challenge letter from the Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu production groups of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to national model farmers Yang Zhenru, Qu Yaoli, and others. This is a major event on the agricultural production front in our country.
    The old Chinese army was a tool used by the rulers to control and exploit the people, and also a destroyer of large-scale production. In contrast, the People's Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party not only defended our great motherland with blood and flesh and continues to defend it, but also constantly engages in labor production in order to reduce the burden on the people and cooperate with the people of the whole country to accelerate the economic construction of the new democracy. In the past two years, the Xinjiang garrison has reclaimed 1.6 million mu of wasteland and built huge water conservancy projects under extremely difficult conditions. In the near future, all personnel of the entire army, except for military schools and certain border guard units, will be completely self-sufficient in grain, fodder, and all expenses. The Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu groups' initiative to launch a competition and challenge the nationally renowned labor models is a concrete manifestation of the great patriotic spirit of the Xinjiang garrison.
    The characteristics of the competition plan of the Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu groups are few people, large land area, and high yield. These two groups are part of the large-scale production organization of the entire military reclamation farm. Their production method is collective; they not only improved labor efficiency, but also built large-scale irrigation systems and used new production tools; their production technology is scientific and advanced. They selected excellent Soviet varieties and adopted deep plowing, close planting, and heavy fertilization methods. This is an important reason why they were able to create and propose such high yield increase standards.
    All localities should mobilize the broad masses of peasants and farm workers to learn from the new heroic spirit of the Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu groups on the production front, organize themselves widely, work hard, study technology, wage a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, learn from the planned output proposed by the Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu groups, and strive for a greater harvest this year.

    向杨甫臣、陈友禄生产小组看齐
    今天本报发表了中国人民解放军新疆军区某部杨甫臣、陈友禄两个生产小组向全国丰产模范杨振儒、曲耀离等的应战书。这是我国农业生产战线上的一件大事。
    旧中国的军队是统治者用以统治宰割人民的工具，也是大规模的生产的破坏者。与此相反，在中国共产党领导下的人民军队，不仅以血肉捍卫了并继续捍卫着我们伟大的祖国，而且不断地从事劳动生产，以便减轻人民负担，协同全国人民，加速新民主主义的经济建设。近两年来，新疆驻军在极其艰苦的条件下，开垦了一百六十万亩荒地，兴修了庞大的水利工程。在不久的将来，全军除军事学校及某些边防警卫部队外，全部人员的粮食、马料及一切经费，都可完全自给。杨甫臣、陈友禄两小组发起竞赛号召，向全国著名的劳动模范发起应战，就是新疆驻军伟大的爱国主义精神的具体表现。
    杨甫臣、陈友禄两小组竞赛计划的特点是人少、地多而产量高。他们这两个小组是整个军垦农场大生产组织中的一部分。他们的生产方式是集体的；他们不仅提高了劳动效率，而且建设了大规模的灌溉系统，使用了新式生产工具；他们的生产技术是科学的，先进的。他们选用了苏联的优良品种，采用了深耕密植多肥的耕作方法。这是他们能够创造并提出这样高的增产标准的重要原因。
    各地应该发动广大农民及农场职工学习杨甫臣、陈友禄两小组在生产战线上的新英雄主义精神，广泛地组织起来，辛勤劳作、钻研技术，和各种自然灾害进行顽强斗争，向杨甫臣、陈友禄两小组所提出的计划产量看齐，争取今年更大的丰收。
