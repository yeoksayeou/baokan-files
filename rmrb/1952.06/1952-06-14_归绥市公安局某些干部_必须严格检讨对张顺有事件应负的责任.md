	Certain Cadres of the Guihua City Public Security Bureau
	Must Strictly Examine Their Responsibility for the Zhang Shunyou Incident

To the Editor: I am a staff member of the Yanggao County People's Court in Chahar Province. After the People's Daily published Comrade Liu Lantao of the North China Bureau of the CCP's criticism of various organs for incorrectly handling the case of cart driver Zhang Shunyou reporting a counter-revolutionary on May 30th, the leading cadres of our court sent me and Zhang Ziying, a staff member of the county Public Security Bureau, to Guihua City to understand how the relevant departments handled the case. We arrived at the Guihua City Public Security Bureau at 7:00 AM on June 1st, but the relevant comrades had not yet gotten up. We waited on the street for over an hour, and when we went back, the bureau said they had gone out. It was not until after 12:00 noon that the leading cadres of the bureau assigned the matter to the fourth section of the bureau. The staff of the fourth section received us extremely coldly. We explained the importance of the case to them and agreed to jointly study the handling of the case with the Guihua City People's Court at 7:00 PM. When we went to the fourth section of the bureau for the third time, a staff member surnamed Hao was lying on the sofa with a newspaper, and ignored us for half an hour. We had no choice but to go to the Guihua City People's Court alone. Afterwards, we asked the fourth section of the bureau by telephone to send someone to the Guihua City People's Court to jointly study the matter. However, the other party actually said, "This matter has little to do with us." They also said that they did not understand the situation of the case and refused to participate. Is it not a big problem that the Guihua City Public Security Bureau put handcuffs on cart driver Zhang Shunyou, who reported a counter-revolutionary? How can they say that it has nothing to do with them? This shows that the Guihua City Public Security Bureau does not yet have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the case, and their bureaucratic work style is still very serious. I suggest that they conduct a very good self-criticism.  Wang Shangzhi

	Editor's Note: The incident of cart driver Zhang Shunyou encountering numerous obstacles in reporting a counter-revolutionary has aroused serious attention from various leading organs and the broad masses of readers. All responsible cadres of the organs related to this case must quickly conduct a serious self-criticism. Judging from the situation reflected by reader Wang Shangzhi, the cadres of the Guihua City Public Security Bureau have not learned a lesson from the Zhang Shunyou incident, and their bureaucratic work style is still very serious. This is intolerable. We suggest that the Guihua City People's Government and the Public Security Department of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government thoroughly investigate this matter and publish the results in the newspaper.

    归绥市公安局某些干部
    必须严格检讨对张顺有事件应负的责任
    编辑同志：我是察哈尔省阳高县人民法院的工作人员。五月三十日人民日报发表了中共中央华北局刘澜涛同志对各机关错误地处理赶车工人张顺有检举反革命事件的批评以后，我院领导干部就派我和本县公安局工作人员张子英前往归绥市各有关部门了解他们处理该案的情况。我们在六月一日上午七点钟到了归绥市公安局，有关同志还没有起床。我们在街上等了一点多钟，再去时，该局又说他们上街去了。等到中午十二点钟以后，该局领导干部才把这件事情批到该局第四科去办。第四科的工作人员极其冷淡地接见了我们。我们向他们说明了这个案件的重要性，并约定下午七时和归绥市人民法院共同研究这个案件的处理情况。当我们第三次到该局第四科时，有一位姓浩的工作人员拿着报纸躺在沙发上，一直让我们等了半个钟头，也没有理我们。我们只好单独去归绥市人民法院。之后，我们又在电话中请该局第四科派人到归绥市人民法院共同研究这件事情。可是，对方竟说：“这事和我们的关系不大。”还说对此案情况不了解，拒绝参加。该局给检举反革命分子的赶车工人张顺有带上手铐，这问题还不大吗？这还能说和他们没有关系吗？这可以说明归绥市公安局对该案的严重性还认识不够，他们的官僚主义作风还很严重。我建议他们很好地作检讨。  王尚智
    编者按：赶车工人张顺有检举反革命分子遭到重重阻难的事件，已引起了各个领导机关和广大读者的严重注意。所有与此案有关的机关负责干部都必须迅速进行认真的检讨。从读者王尚智反映的情况来看，归绥市公安局的干部并没有从张顺有事件中得到教训，他们的官僚主义作风仍然十分严重。这是令人不能容忍的。我们建议归绥市人民政府及绥远省人民政府公安厅彻查此事，并将结果在报上公布。
