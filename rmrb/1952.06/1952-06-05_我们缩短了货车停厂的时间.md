    We Shortened the Time Trucks Stayed in the Factory
    Comrade Editor: On May 22nd, your newspaper published a reader's letter suggesting that the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant implement the regulations regarding the time trucks stay in the factory. In 1949, the time trucks stayed in our Fuxin Mining Bureau's Coal Preparation Plant also frequently exceeded the regulations. We have continuously worked to improve this situation, and by May of this year, we had shortened the time trucks stayed in the factory to 4 hours and 17 minutes, which is significantly less than the 5 hours and 30 minutes stipulated by the Railway Bureau. We are now sharing our experiences in improving our work for the reference of relevant units.
    First, we closely linked the processes of loading, transporting, and dispatching (including weighing) within the factory. We organized a joint "production (loading), transportation (transport), and inspection (weighing)" team and signed a closely linked contract. This contract stipulates that the surplus or deficiency in the loading department should not exceed one ton. The transportation department must be notified to pick up the truck within ten minutes of loading, without delay. The transportation department must pick up the truck within fifteen minutes of being notified. The weighing department must complete the weighing of a truck within three minutes when it leaves the factory, including adding or unloading in case of surplus or deficiency. These regulations have made the work of each department more intensive and eliminated the past problem of sloppy work.
    Second, we strengthened dispatching work. The factory's transportation department and the liaison office, as well as the liaison office and the station, have established a vehicle forecasting system. Through the liaison office, the transportation department can know the composition of the vehicles before the train arrives at the station. If it is a freight car, the transportation personnel will contact the warehouse and unloading units to designate the delivery location; if it is an empty car, the transportation personnel will contact the loading units to understand the number of cars needed and which track they should be sent to. This system ensures that no time is wasted after the vehicles enter the factory. To speed up the unloading work, the transportation department stipulates a certain unloading time, and a usage fee is charged if the time is exceeded.
    Third, we learned and promoted advanced experiences. In the past, the transportation staff of our factory had the conservative idea that "we cannot compare with the Railway Bureau" and were unwilling to actively learn advanced experiences. With the help of the Railway Bureau, we also learned Li Xikui's shunting method. This has greatly improved transportation work.

### 我们缩短了货车停厂的时间

    我们缩短了货车停厂的时间
    编辑同志：五月二十二日你报刊载了一封读者来信，建议石景山钢铁厂执行货车停厂时间的规定。一九四九年，我们阜新矿务局选煤厂的货车停厂时间，也经常超过规定。我们不断努力改善这种情况，到今年五月份，我们已经把货车停厂时间缩短到四点十七分，比路局规定的五点三十分少了很多。我们现在把改进工作的经验介绍出来，供有关单位参考。
    第一，把厂内装车、运输、发送（包括检斤）等工序紧密地衔接起来。我们组织了一个产（装车）、运（运输）、检（检斤）联合小组，签订了一个紧密衔接的联系合同。这个合同规定：装车部门关于装车的盈亏量不得超过一吨，装完车十分钟以内，通知运输部门取车，不得延误；运输部门必须在得到通知后十五分钟内取车；检斤部门在货车出厂时，要在三分钟内检完一辆车，其中包括遇有盈亏情况时的添卸工作。这些规定，使各部门的工作紧张起来，一扫过去工作散漫的毛病。
    第二，加强调配工作。厂里运输部门和联络所，联络所和车站，都建立了车辆预报制。通过联络所，运输部门在列车到站之前，就可知道车辆的组成情况。如果是货车，运输人员就和仓库及卸车单位联系，指定配送地点；如果是空车，运输人员就和装车单位联系，了解需要车子的数量和应该送入那条车道。这个制度可使车辆入厂后不浪费一点时间。为了抓紧卸车工作，运输部门规定一定的卸车时间，超过时间就征收使用费。
    第三，学习和推广先进经验。我厂运输工作人员，过去有“不能和路局相比”的保守思想，不肯积极学习先进经验。经过路局帮助，也学习了李锡奎调车法。这使运输工作得到很多改进。阜新矿务局选煤厂
