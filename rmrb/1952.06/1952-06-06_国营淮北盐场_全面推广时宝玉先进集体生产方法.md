    State-Run Huai Bei Salt Field
    Fully Promoting Shi Baoyu's Advanced Collective Production Method

    After the state-run Huai Bei Salt Field fully promoted the advanced collective production method of the Shi Baoyu group, the production outlook of the entire field fundamentally changed, and the potential production capacity was fully utilized, providing a strong guarantee for the field's plan to increase production and practice economy by 25 billion yuan in 1952.

    The Shi Baoyu group's collective production method, after being summarized last year, has been determined to be suitable for full-scale promotion. In August of last year, the East China Salt Affairs Bureau and the Huai Bei Party, administrative, and trade union leadership organs decided to fully promote this production method in the Huai Bei Salt Field. Up to now, 2,702 of the field's 2,758 salt pans have adopted this production method. The groups implementing collective production have basically mastered the six major characteristics of the Shi Baoyu group, changed the past individual and scattered production methods, and achieved significant results. This year, the field's production plan has increased by 21.56% compared to last year's actual output, of which the increase due to the adoption of the Shi Baoyu group's collective production method accounts for 50% of the field's total increase. Due to the implementation of collective production, participants are able to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses. Therefore, the field required 614.5 fewer laborers this year than last year, while still maintaining production. This lays the foundation for future precise calculation of labor quotas. Because the factory has uniformly allocated manpower and systematically carried out the division of labor, salt cultivation and salt harvesting have formed specialized groups to study and improve technology, overcoming the past bias that anyone could master production without technical knowledge, thereby reducing defective salt products and improving the quality of salt. In this year's spring harvest up to the end of April at the Tainan First Field, first-grade salt accounted for 95.17%, while second-grade salt accounted for only 4.83%. This year's second-grade salt quality is comparable to last year's first-grade salt. After the implementation of the collective production method, workers' enthusiasm for production has increased, and their attitude towards labor has changed.

    The Shi Baoyu group's collective production method has been able to be fully promoted and achieve significant results mainly because: 1. The field established a committee for promoting advanced experience, specifically responsible for promotion. In the 1952 management plan, the field also included the promotion of this experience as a major element. The Huai Bei Salt Field Trade Union also included the promotion of this experience as a key to completing this year's production increase and economy plan in its 1952 work plan. 2. Last August, the first Huai Bei Salt Field model worker representative conference summarized and exchanged the experience of the Shi Baoyu group's collective production method. Subsequently, various fields conducted extensive and in-depth publicity and education through meetings of all sizes, repeatedly explaining that promoting the Shi Baoyu group's collective production method could change the individual and scattered production situation in the salt field and develop it towards collective and centralized production. The publicity focused on criticizing conservative thinking. 3. At the same time as promoting the collective production method, a wage system based on work performed was implemented, which is one of the keys to promoting and consolidating collective production. The entire field implemented a new "three-grade, nine-level" wage system, which democratically assessed and rationally distributed wages based on labor intensity and labor skills. 4. Appropriately adjusted and allocated stronger group leaders to lead and manage the group's production. Only group leaders with a high sense of responsibility and selflessness can prevent the group from deviating in collective production.

    However, there are also some shortcomings in the promotion work. Although some groups have implemented collective production, because the motives of some salt workers participating in collective production are impure, this production method has become a formality, forming a "fake collective." Many groups that have implemented collective production do not adopt the "scoring" method, and many groups have experienced a rush to score points in collective production due to the inadequate allocation and use of labor. In addition, because this is new work, many group leaders still lack experience in leading and guiding group collective production, causing some unreasonable phenomena in manpower allocation, and some salt workers sometimes have nothing to do.

    Currently, the entire field is actively overcoming the above shortcomings and correcting certain tendencies towards formalism. The original complex land structure will also be improved in a step-by-step and planned manner. (Ren Ligao, Shen Min, Yang Dongye)

    国营淮北盐场
    全面推广时宝玉先进集体生产方法
    国营淮北盐场全面推广了时宝玉小组先进的集体生产方式以后，基本上改变了全场的生产面貌，充分发挥了生产潜在能力，给全场一九五二年增产节约二百五十亿元的计划提供了有力的保证。
    时宝玉小组集体生产方式经过去年总结后，已被确定能够全面推广。去年八月，华东区盐务管理局及淮北党、行政、工会领导机关决定在淮北盐场全面推广这一生产方式。到目前为止，全场二千七百五十八份盐滩中，有二千七百零二份盐滩已推广了这一生产方式。实行集体生产的小组，基本上掌握了时宝玉小组的六大特点，改变了过去个体分散的生产方式，获得显著效果。今年全场的生产计划比去年的实际产量提高了百分之二十一点五六，其中因采用时宝玉小组的集体生产方式提高的产量，即占全场所提高产量的百分之五十。由于实行了集体生产，参加生产的人能够互相取长补短，因此，全场今年比去年少配备了六百一十四点五个劳动力，还能照样生产。这就打下了今后精算劳动定额的基础。该厂由于统一分配了人工，有计划地进行操作分工，种盐和刳盐都组成专门小组，研究、改进技术，克服了过去认为没有技术也能掌握生产的偏向，因而减少了盐的废品，提高了盐的质量。台南一场在今年春扫到四月底的产品中，头等盐占百分之九十五点一七，二等盐只占百分之四点八三；今年二等盐的质量，可以顶得上去年头等盐的质量。推行集体生产方式以后，工人的生产积极性提高了，劳动态度改变了。
    时宝玉小组集体生产方式所以能全面推广，并已获得显著效果，主要原因是：一、该场成立了推广先进经验委员会，专门负责推广。在一九五二年的经营计划中，该场并把推广这个经验作为主要内容。淮北盐场工会在一九五二年工作计划中，也把推广这个经验，作为今年完成增产节约计划的重要关键。二、去年八月，淮北盐场首届劳动模范代表大会总结和交流了时宝玉小组集体生产方式的经验。接着，各场就通过大小会议，不断进行广泛而深入的宣传教育，反复说明：推广时宝玉小组集体生产方式，可以改变盐场个体、分散生产的情况，使之向集体和集中生产发展。在宣传中着重批判了保守思想。三、在推广集体生产方式的同时，并实行了按劳取酬的工资制度，这是推广和巩固集体生产的关键之一。全场实行了“三等九级”的新工资制，按劳动强度和劳动技术，进行民主评定，合理分配工资。四、适当调整和配备较强的小组长，领导和掌握小组的生产。只有有高度责任心和大公无私的小组长，才能使小组在进行集体生产中不发生偏向。
    但在推广工作中也还有一些缺点。有些小组虽然实行了集体生产，但由于某些盐工参加集体生产的动机不纯，因此，使这种生产方式流于形式，形成了“假集体”。有很多实行集体生产的小组，不采取“记分”方法，许多小组由于劳动力分配和使用得不够切当，在集体生产中发生了抢分现象。另外，由于这是新的工作，许多小组长还缺乏领导和指导小组集体生产的经验，在人工调配上造成一些不合理现象，有的盐工有时闲下来没有事情做。
    目前，全场正在积极克服以上缺点，纠正某些形式主义的偏向。并将有步骤地有计划地改进原始复杂的滩地结构。（任利戈、沈敏、杨东野）
