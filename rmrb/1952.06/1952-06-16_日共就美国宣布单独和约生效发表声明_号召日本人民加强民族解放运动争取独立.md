    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Delayed Dispatch: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on April 28 regarding the U.S. government's declaration that April 28 would be the "date the peace treaty takes effect." The statement said that on April 28, the first U.S. Ambassador to Japan would take office, and Japan would welcome the Japanese governor-general of the U.S. government. From then on, Japan would be in the state of "Manchukuo" twenty years ago. In essence, due to the separate peace treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," Japan has been reduced to a military colony of U.S. imperialism.
    The statement pointed out that in order to maintain the occupation system, the Yoshida government is preparing to formulate the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law" and the "Special Criminal Law," rebuild the Japanese army, and expand the "Special Examination Bureau." All this is nothing more than rebuilding and expanding the occupation system. This is the truth of Japan's independence. This is not a day of celebration, but a day of grief and indignation.
    The statement emphasized that the great Japanese nation, with two thousand years of independent history, will never yield. From today onwards, the national liberation struggle will spread like wildfire.
    The statement said that the Japanese working class has already begun to take action. This has been confirmed by the general strikes on April 12 and 18 against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Law." This awakening is expanding with astonishing vigor among workers, farmers, citizens, students, intellectuals.
    The statement pointed out that the people of the whole country, led by the working class, have begun to rise up to carry out the national liberation struggle. This is the Japanese people's answer to the day of national humiliation.
    The statement finally called on the Japanese people to contribute everything to precious national independence, and proposed overthrowing the traitorous Yoshida Cabinet and designating April 28 as Japan's National Day of Humiliation.

    日共就美国宣布单独和约生效发表声明
    号召日本人民加强民族解放运动争取独立
    【新华社十五日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部在四月二十八日就美国政府宣布以四月二十八日为“和约生效日”一事发表声明说：四月二十八日美国第一任驻日大使将上任，日本将迎接美国政府的日本总督，从此日本即将处于二十年前“满洲国”的状态。实质上，由于单独和约与美日“安全条约”，日本已经沦落为美帝国主义的军事殖民地。
    声明指出：吉田政府为了维持占领制度，于是要制订“防止破坏活动法案”和“刑事特别法案”，重建日本的陆军和扩大“特别审查局”。这一切都不外是把占领制度加以重建和扩大。这就是日本独立的真相。这不是值得庆祝的纪念日，而是悲愤的纪念日。
    声明强调说：拥有两千年独立历史的伟大日本民族，绝不屈服。今天以后，民族解放斗争将像燎原之火一般地扩展开来。
    声明说：日本工人阶级已经开始行动。这已经由这次为反对“防止破坏活动法案”而举行的四月十二日、十八日的总罢工所证实。这种觉醒，正以惊人的气魄，在工人、农民、市民、学生、知识分子中间扩大着。
    声明指出：以工人阶级为首，全国人民开始起来进行民族解放斗争了。这就是日本人民对于国耻纪念日的答复。
    声明最后号召日本人民为宝贵的民族独立贡献出一切，并提出打倒卖国的吉田内阁，把四月二十八日定为日本的国耻纪念日。
