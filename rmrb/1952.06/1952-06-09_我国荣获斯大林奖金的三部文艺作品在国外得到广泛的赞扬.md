The works of Chinese writers Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, He Jingzhi, Ding Yi, and others, "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," "Hurricane," and "The White Haired Girl," which won the 1951 Stalin Prizes, are significant achievements of the new China's literary and art circles under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policies. They are not only welcomed by Chinese readers and audiences but also praised by foreign readers and audiences. Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" has been translated into twelve foreign languages, including Russian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Romanian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Bulgarian, Japanese, German, and Mongolian. The Russian version alone has been printed in 500,000 copies as a popular edition. Zhou Libo's "Hurricane" also has abridged translations in Russian and Japanese, as well as translations in Hungarian and Czech. The film "The White Haired Girl" and the opera "The White Haired Girl" performed by the Chinese Youth Art Troupe have also been warmly received abroad. The city of Ostrava in Moravia, Czechoslovakia, performed the opera in January of last year, and the Czech Military Theatre also performed it continuously in Prague on February 24 of the same year.

"The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" attracted attention from various quarters after it was published in the Soviet magazine "Znamya" in 1948. Simonov said in his article "When the Sun Rises" (see Soviet "Izvestia," October 22, 1948): "The author skillfully accomplished the main task, which is to explain how hundreds of millions of Chinese working people, under the influence of the Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, awakened and joined the struggle for a new life. The value of the novel 'The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River' lies in this." Chezhanovsky also introduced "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" in the "Culture and Life" newspaper on October 31. He said: "The female writer Ding Ling personally participated in the land reform in a county in northern China, so she can convincingly describe the complex process of the Chinese peasant class's awakening and the growth of political activism... Although the development of events is only in one village, and the time is only one month, new people are actively participating in political life at all times, the scale of the land reform movement is expanding, organizations are being established to bring peasants directly closer to the regime, and the humiliated peasants have become the masters of the countryside. This novel shows the Chinese people's land reform against large and small feudal landlords." Soviet local newspapers also recommended this novel. In a review by Linov published in the "Udmurt Truth" on February 15, 1950, the author pointed out: "This work illustrates the class struggle in the Chinese countryside." and said: "Soviet readers like this novel very much. From this book, we learn about the lives of Chinese peasants, their struggles, and their trust in the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Mao Zedong." Gorinevich wrote in the "Kaliningrad Truth" on October 15: "Ding Ling truthfully and without embellishment wrote about the complex situation in this village." Petrov wrote in an article published in "Soviet Literature" on April 1 this year: "The profound content of this book and the ingenious depiction of the characters explain the success of the novel. The language of the novel is simple and expressive. The characters' speeches show us the richness of the Chinese peasants' spiritual world."

Ruderman, the Russian translator of "Hurricane," said in the preface to the Russian version of this novel: "The central idea of 'Hurricane'—the peasants' awareness of political activities and the Communist Party's education of the oppressed people into brave, conscious fighters for the thorough reconstruction of society—makes this work a realistic work to overcome the feudal remnants in the consciousness of the Chinese rural working people." At the same time, he pointed out: "The novel 'Hurricane' is different from other Chinese works on land reform in that it covers a wide and rich range of content." The Japanese translator of "Hurricane," Wataru Shishido, said in the "Translator's Preface": "Japanese people must fully understand Manchuria. Indeed, they understand it, because in the entire history of Japanese imperialism's external expansion, Manchuria has occupied a large position in the eyes of the Japanese. Colonial operations have been going on here for many years. However, that is an imperialist way of understanding, and therefore a fatally erroneous blind understanding. This has been fully and completely exposed when 'Manchukuo' collapsed... Its long-term old connection with Japan has been erased without leaving a trace, and a miraculously new world has been born... We must clearly recognize today that the foundation of imperialism is weak. What I felt first after reading Zhou Libo's novel 'Hurricane' was this, and this is what prompted me to introduce this book to Japanese readers."

The "Soviet Art Newspaper" has also commented on the opera "The White Haired Girl." Savilgain said in the article "A Brilliant Page in the Life of the Chinese People": "The script of 'The White Haired Girl' is written with great love for the people and a deep understanding of their lives. In the skillfully depicted images of peasants, one can perceive the author's ability to delve into the spiritual world of people." He also pointed out: "The authors of 'The White Haired Girl' have extensively incorporated the creation of folk music into the play. This practice of creatively linking with folk art is a great achievement of the new Chinese drama."

    我国荣获斯大林奖金的三部文艺作品在国外得到广泛的赞扬
    荣获一九五一年斯大林奖金的我国作家丁玲、周立波、贺敬之、丁毅等的作品：“太阳照在桑乾河上”、“暴风骤雨”和“白毛女”，是在毛泽东文艺方针指导下的新中国文艺界的重大收获。它们不但受到中国读者和观众的欢迎，而且受到国外读者和观众的赞扬。丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”，已有俄文、乌克兰文、立陶宛文、拉脱维亚文、罗马尼亚文、捷克文、匈牙利文、波兰文、保加利亚文、日文、德文、蒙古文等十二种外文译本。俄文译本，曾印了五十万册普及本。周立波的“暴风骤雨”也有了俄文和日文节译本，还有匈牙利和捷克文的译文。电影“白毛女”和我国青年文艺工作团演出的歌剧“白毛女”，也在国外受到了热烈的欢迎。捷克摩拉维亚州俄斯特拉发城在去年一月间演出了这个歌剧，同年二月二十四日，捷克军人剧院又在布拉格连续上演。
    “太阳照在桑干河上”于一九四八年在苏联“旗”杂志发表后，引起了各方面的注意。谢蒙诺夫在“当太阳升起了的时候”一文（见一九四八年十月二十二日苏联消息报）中说：“作者技巧地把主要的任务实现了，这个主要的任务，就是说明数万万中国劳动人民怎样在以毛泽东为首的共产党的影响下醒悟过来，参加了争取新生活的斗争。‘太阳照在桑乾河上’这本小说的价值就在于此。”切察诺夫斯基也在十月三十一日“文化与生活报”上，介绍了“太阳照在桑乾河上”。他说：“女作家丁玲曾亲身参加了中国北方一个县里的土地改革，所以能够使人信服地描写出中国农民阶级觉悟和政治积极性增长的复杂过程……。虽然事情的发展仅在一个村庄，时间仅有一个月，但是时时都有新的人积极地参加了政治生活，土地改革运动的规模扩大着，建立了使农民直接接近政权的组织，并使受屈辱的农民成了农村的主人。这部小说表现了中国人民反对大小封建主的土地改革。”苏联的地方报纸也推荐了这本小说。在一九五○年二月十五日的“乌德摩尔梯真理报”发表的利诺夫的一篇评介中，作者指出：“这部作品说明了中国农村里的阶级斗争。”并说：“苏联的读者是非常喜欢这部小说的。我们从这本书里知道中国农民的生活、他们的斗争和他们对中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的信赖。”哥里涅维奇在十月十五日“加里宁格勒真理报”上写道：“丁玲真实地、毫无粉饰地写出了这个村庄的复杂情况。”彼特罗夫在今年四月一日“苏联文学报”上发表的一篇文章中写道：“这本书内容的深刻和人物形象的巧妙表现，说明了小说的成功。小说的语言是简单而富于表现性的。人物的讲话，使我们看到中国农民精神世界的丰富。”
    鲁得曼是“暴风骤雨”的俄文翻译者，他在这部小说的俄文版序言里说：“‘暴风骤雨’的中心思想——农民对政治活动的觉悟和共产党把受压迫的人们教育成勇敢的、有觉悟的、争取彻底重建社会的战士——使这部作品成为克服中国农村劳动人民意识中封建残余的一部现实作品。”同时，他又指出：“‘暴风骤雨’小说不同于其他关于土地改革的中国作品，内容涉及的范围是广阔的，而且是丰富的。”“暴风骤雨”的日文翻译者鹿地亘在“译者前言”中说：“日本人对于满洲，一定是完全了解的。确实是了解吧，因为在日本帝国主义向外扩展的全部历史中，满洲在日本人眼中占了很大的地位，在这里，多少年来不断进行着殖民地的经营。但是，那是一种帝国主义者的认识方法，因而是致命错误的盲目了解。这在‘满洲国’崩溃时，已经完全无遗地暴露了……它和日本长期的旧的联系，连痕迹也不留地被抹掉了，奇迹一样的新世界诞生了。……我们今天必须明确地认识：帝国主义的基础是薄弱的。读周立波的小说‘暴风骤雨’，我首先感到的是这一点，驱使我把这本书介绍给日本读者的，也是这一点。”
    “苏维埃艺术报”对歌剧“白毛女”也有过评论。萨维尔迦因在“中国人民生活的灿烂的一页”一文里说：“‘白毛女’这一剧本是以伟大的对人民的爱和对他们生活的深入了解而写成的。在被技巧地描写成的农民的形象中，可以觉察到作者善于深入人的精神世界的本领。”他又指出：“‘白毛女’的作者们曾广泛地把民间音乐的创作编入该剧中，这种和民间艺术作创造性的联系的作法是新中国戏剧的一个巨大的成就。”
