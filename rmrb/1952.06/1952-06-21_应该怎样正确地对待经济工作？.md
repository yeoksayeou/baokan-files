How Should Economic Work Be Correctly Approached?

Editor's Note: Since this column raised the question "How should economic work be correctly approached?" on June 15th to start a discussion, we have received 162 letters discussing this issue as of the 20th, which proves that many comrades are very concerned about this issue. In order to thoroughly and completely solve this problem, we hope that economic workers will actively participate in this discussion, relate it to their own thoughts, explain how economic work should be correctly approached, and use concrete and vivid facts to illustrate the process of their own ideological transformation and the ideological problems that have not yet been resolved. We also hope that responsible persons from Party committees and economic departments at all levels will specifically introduce their experiences in solving the ideological problems of economic workers and propose methods for cultivating economic workers.

    应该怎样正确地对待经济工作？
    编者按：本栏在六月十五日提出了“应该怎样正确地对待经济工作”的问题展开讨论以后，截至二十日止，已经收到了讨论这个问题的来信一百六十二件，这证明了许多同志是非常关心这个问题的。为了圆满地、彻底地解决这个问题，我们希望经济工作人员热烈地参加这次讨论，联系自己的思想，说明应该如何正确地对待经济工作，用具体生动的事实，说明自己思想转变的过程和目前还没有解决的思想问题。我们还希望各级党委和经济部门负责人员，具体地介绍解决经济工作人员思想问题的经验，提出培养经济工作人员的办法。
