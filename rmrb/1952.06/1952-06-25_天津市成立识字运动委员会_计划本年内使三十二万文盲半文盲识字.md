The Tianjin Municipal People's Government has issued three documents: the "Decision on Promoting the Quick Literacy Method and Carrying out the Literacy Movement," the "Tianjin 1952 Literacy Movement Work Plan," and the "Tianjin Municipal Level Literacy Movement Committee Organizational Regulations." These documents decide to launch a literacy movement throughout the city, enabling 320,000 illiterate and semi-literate people among the working people to master written language in a short period of time. This will further improve their political, cultural, and technical levels, and allow them to better exert their creativity and initiative in the country's large-scale construction. According to the decision of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, the Tianjin Literacy Movement Committee has been officially established, with Mayor Huang Jing as the Director and Huang Huoqing and Huang Songling as the Deputy Directors. The committee held its first meeting at 4:00 PM on the 20th.

    The meeting listened to the report of Liang Hanbing, the Secretary-General of the committee and Director of the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau. In his report, he conveyed the resolutions and spirit of the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Workers' Spare-Time Education Committee, as well as the instructions of the relevant departments of the Central People's Government on this issue. Representatives from the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Municipal Women's Federation, reported on the progress of promoting the Qi Jianhua Quick Literacy Method and carrying out the literacy movement. The meeting pointed out that since the publication of the Qi Jianhua Quick Literacy Method, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of working people, and it fully meets the urgent demands of working people and worker-peasant cadres to learn culture. Promoting the quick literacy method and vigorously carrying out the literacy movement is a revolutionary mass cultural movement; therefore, leading departments at all levels and all relevant units must cooperate closely and remove all obstacles to ensure the smooth development of this movement. At present, we should vigorously cultivate and improve mass literacy teachers and full-time teachers.

    Regarding organizational structure, the meeting decided that literacy movement committees at all levels should be established quickly in order to begin investigating and organizing illiterates to enroll in school, training and allocating teachers, and carrying out propaganda and mobilization work.

    The meeting believed that in order to ensure the smooth development of this movement, it is necessary to do a good job in propaganda and mobilization. Therefore, all relevant propaganda departments must widely mobilize all forces and use various forms of propaganda to carry out this movement. Necessary explanations or criticisms must be given in a timely manner to those who do not pay attention to this work or have ideological obstacles.

    In order to consolidate the gains of the literacy movement, the meeting called on all parties, including teachers, writers, and cultural, educational, and publishing institutions, to immediately compile and publish a large number of popular reading materials to meet the needs of students after they become literate. This is a key to consolidating learning outcomes.

    Regarding guaranteeing study time, the meeting pointed out that since this movement is a combative and intensive movement, guaranteeing study time is decisive for whether or not victory can be achieved. Leading departments at all levels should arrange production, work, and study time well, and no meetings should encroach on literacy study time.

    Finally, in their speeches, the committee members unanimously agreed that carrying out the literacy movement is a major event in Tianjin's cultural and educational undertaking, and all relevant parties should strongly support and assist in order to successfully complete the task of enabling 320,000 illiterate and semi-literate people to recognize 2,000 characters this year.
