The Northeast Coal Mine Administration and the Coal Mine Trade Union have instructed all mines to promote Cui Guoshan's advanced rapid tunneling experience.

    Over the past two years, significant achievements have been made in promoting new-style coal mining methods in Northeast coal mines. However, in terms of coal mining preparation work, the tunneling speed is not high enough to meet the needs of coal mining. Since the second half of 1951, the Coal Mine Administration has repeatedly issued instructions and implemented specific measures to strengthen tunneling work.

    Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling team at Hengshan Coal Mine of Jixi Mining Bureau, in response to the government's call for increased production and conservation, experimented with multi-heading tunneling in the No. 8 mine in December of last year, creating a new record of an average daily advance of 27 meters and a maximum of 36.4 meters. In early April of this year, Cui Guoshan transferred to work in the No. 4 mine and created a new record of 40.85 meters per day (including 14.1 meters for the main roadway), and at the end of April, an even higher record of 44.95 meters per day, with a monthly advance of 703 meters. The emergence of this advanced experience has opened up avenues for coal mines to strengthen production preparation work and created prerequisites for expanding production.

    After summarizing the advanced experience of Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling team, the Coal Mine Administration believes that promoting the team's advanced experience is an important link in doing a good job in coal mine production preparation work. To this end, the following instructions are issued:

    1.  Where the planned roadway layout is suitable for multi-heading tunneling, the multi-heading tunneling method should be widely adopted: that is, the staff of one team or group should simultaneously carry out the tunneling work of two or more roadways, with unified command, reasonable division of labor, so that each work process and each type of work can be closely coordinated to give full play to labor efficiency and eliminate idle work. Electric drills and pneumatic picks should be used for mobile operations to increase the utilization rate of machinery.

    2.  Use long drill rods to drill deep holes and increase the number of blasting times: The advanced experience of Cui Guoshan's team, Li Baoshu's team in Fuxin, and other mining areas has fully proved that drilling deep holes and increasing the number of blasting times is an effective way to improve tunneling efficiency, accelerate tunneling speed, and reduce material consumption. The tunneling sites in each mining area, especially the rapid tunneling teams and advanced tunneling teams (rapid tunneling teams are of course advanced teams), must conscientiously promote this advanced experience.

    3.  The members of the rapid tunneling team and the advanced tunneling team must be fixed, and the team's equipment and tools must also be fixed. Formulate the team's annual action plan and work according to the plan. On this basis, give play to mass wisdom, study technology, improve organization, and establish systems to improve engineering quality and accelerate tunneling speed. The excellent results of Cui Guoshan's tunneling team were obtained under such circumstances.

    4.  Improve labor organization and implement cyclic schedule operation: Cui Guoshan's tunneling team has continuously improved its labor organization and strictly operated according to the cyclic schedule, creating a record of reaching ten cycles per day. Achieving operation according to the cycle is a comprehensive embodiment of a sound labor organization, close cooperation between direct workers and auxiliary workers, sufficient equipment, and necessary technical management systems. This is the key to improving tunneling efficiency and must be achieved and consolidated through continuous efforts.

    5.  Promoting advanced experience is an arduous ideological struggle process. In order to enable the masses to master this advanced experience, it is necessary to carry out in-depth and extensive publicity and education. Overcome the conservative ideas and complacency that emphasize special circumstances and are unwilling to accept advanced experience, educate employees to humbly learn advanced experience and actively organize the use of advanced experience and advanced production methods, so that the advanced can consolidate and continue to improve, and the backward can catch up with the advanced, so that the tunneling efficiency of coal mines can be universally improved. Therefore, it is also necessary to organize technical personnel to go deep into the front line and actively participate in the promotion of advanced experience. It is necessary to combine the promotion of advanced experience with the creation of new production experience, constantly revise plans, and raise the goals of struggle. After breaking the record of 36.4 meters per day, Cui Guoshan's tunneling team then raised the daily progress to 40 meters. They not only met their own standards but also exceeded many. The leaders of the Jixi Mining Bureau must be determined to consolidate their achievements.

    6.  In promoting advanced experience, attention should be paid to timely summary and rewards. The leaders and engineering technicians of each bureau and mine must regularly check and provide specific help to the work of the rapid tunneling team, ensure the realization of all the conditions for each team to challenge Cui Guoshan's tunneling team, and promptly reflect their work situation.

    东北煤矿管理局、煤矿工会指示各矿推广崔国山快速掘进先进经验
    两年来，东北煤矿推行新式采煤方法是有显著成绩的。但在采煤准备工作方面，由于掘进速度不高，因而不能满足采煤需要。自一九五一年下半年以来，煤矿管理局为加强掘进工作，即曾迭次发出指示，并进行了具体措施。
    鸡西矿务局恒山煤矿崔国山快速掘进队，为响应政府增产节约号召，于去年十二月份在该矿八坑试行多巷掘进，创造了平均日进二十七公尺，最高三十六点四公尺的新纪录。今年四月初崔国山转四坑工作，又创日进四十点八五公尺（内大巷为十四点一公尺）的新纪录，四月末更创日进四十四点九五公尺的更高纪录，月进七百零三公尺。这一先进经验的出现，给煤矿加强生产准备工作开辟了道路，为扩大生产创造了前提。
    煤矿管理局总结了崔国山快速掘进队的先进经验后，认为推广该队的先进经验，是作好煤矿生产准备工作的重要环节。为此特作如下指示：
    一、凡计划中之巷道配布适合于多巷掘进时，应广泛采用多巷掘进方式：即一个队或一个组的工作人员，同时进行两个场所以上巷道的掘进工作，统
    一指挥，合理分工，使每一段工作过程，各工种均能密切配合起来，发挥劳动效率，消灭窝工现象。电钻、风镐流动作业提高机械运用率。
    二、使用长钎子打深眼，增加放炮遍数：崔国山队、阜新李宝书队及其他矿区的先进经验，都充分证明打深眼，增加放炮遍数是提高掘进效率和加快掘进速度以及降低材料消耗的有效办法。各矿区的掘进场子，尤其是快速掘进队及先进掘进队（快速掘进队为当然先进队）的场子，必须认真地推广这一先进经验。
    三、快速掘进队及先进掘进队的队员必须固定起来，队的器械工具也必须固定起来，制订队的全年行动计划，根据计划进行工作。在这一基础上，发挥群众智慧，钻研技术，改进组织，建立制度，以提高工程质量，加快掘进速度。崔国山掘进队的优越成绩就是在这种情况下获得的。
    四、健全劳动组织，执行循环图表作业：崔国山掘进队不断改进劳动组织，严格按循环图表作业，创出日达十个循环的纪录。作到按循环作业，是健全的劳动组织，直接工辅助工的密切配合，充分的设备，以及必要的技术管理制度的综合体现。这是提高掘进效率的关键，必须经过不断的努力才能实现和巩固。
    五、推广先进经验是一个艰苦的思想斗争过程，为使这一先进经验为群众所掌握，就必须进行深入广泛的宣传教育。克服强调情况特殊不愿接受先进经验的保守思想和自满情绪，教育职工虚心学习先进经验并积极组织运用先进经验和先进生产方法，以达到先进者能巩固和继续提高，落后者能赶上先进的，使煤矿的掘进效率普遍提高。因此，又必须组织技术人员深入现场积极参加推广先进经验的工作。要使推广先进经验和创造新的生产经验结合起来，不断修订计划，提高奋斗目标。崔国山掘进队在突破日进三十六点四公尺的纪录后，接着他们就将每日进度提高到四十公尺。他们不但达到了自己所订的标准，并且超过了许多。鸡西矿务局的领导方面必须下定决心巩固他们的成绩。
    六、在推广先进经验中，应注意及时总结和奖励。各局矿的领导和工程技术人员，对快速掘进队的工作必须经常检查与具体帮助，保证实现各队向崔国山掘进队应战的全部条件，并将他们的工作情况及时反映上来。
    一九五二年五月十五日
