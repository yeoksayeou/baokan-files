Xinhua News Agency, New York: TASS reports: The United Nations Security Council met on the afternoon of June 25 to continue discussing the Soviet proposal: The Security Council calls on all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological and chemical weapons.

    Soviet representative Malik made a comprehensive speech, thoroughly exposing the United States' attempt to shelve and reject any proposals to prevent aggression and the use of weapons of mass destruction. He said: The United States attempts to weaken the significance of the Geneva Protocol, describing it as outdated and insufficient. This attempt by the United States to weaken the significance of the Geneva Protocol is ridiculous; it is an attempt to use fine words to justify the US unwillingness to ratify the protocol and its attitude of preventing other countries from ratifying it. Malik emphasized that the US attitude violates international law and the interests of humanity. The Geneva Protocol has and will have international significance.
    Malik pointed out: The US government has not yet said a word against the use of bacteriological weapons. The US government, on the one hand, refuses to condemn the sinful war methods, and on the other hand, refuses to say that it does not intend to use bacteriological weapons. Truman, Acheson, the US Congress, and all US presidential hopefuls have remained silent on this issue; no one has said that he is, in principle, opposed to bacteriological warfare. Malik emphasized that the Security Council should not ignore this fact. The Security Council must call upon all countries that have not participated in and ratified the Geneva Protocol to participate in and ratify it as soon as possible. The US attempt to cast doubt on the Geneva Protocol and the fulfillment of international obligations is worthy of serious attention and should be condemned. Malik pointed out that the policy followed by the United States violates the United Nations Charter, and the people of the world will condemn the US attitude.
    Malik emphasized the fact that the delegations of France and other countries have expressed support for the Geneva Protocol. He said that, in this regard, even the US allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have refused to follow the United States. The majority of the Security Council members have expressed their adherence to the obligations they have undertaken under the Geneva Protocol. However, the US ruling clique is pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war, attempting to undermine the Geneva Protocol, and attempting to instigate other countries not to abide by the terms of the protocol.
    Malik said: The United States has not shown due respect for international agreements and international obligations. The United States is unwilling to be bound by those agreements that hinder its policy of aggression and its policy of seizing world hegemony. The United States attempts to implement the "law of the jungle" in international relations, but the people of the world refuse to take this path. He cited specific examples to illustrate that the reason why the United States opposes the ratification of the Geneva Protocol is because chemical companies and the "merchants of death" who reap huge profits from manufacturing weapons of mass destruction are opposed to it.
    Malik explained that if the Security Council approves the Soviet proposal, it will promote the drafting of a more detailed and comprehensive agreement to prohibit weapons of mass destruction. If countries that have not yet participated in and ratified the Geneva Protocol participate in and ratify it now, then this will be an important step towards peace. In conclusion, Malik called on the Security Council to adopt the Soviet proposal as a preliminary step towards drafting a more detailed and comprehensive agreement prohibiting all weapons of mass destruction.

    马立克在安理会二十五日下午会议上
    痛斥美国企图破坏日内瓦议定书
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会在六月二十五日下午开会，继续讨论苏联的提案：安全理事会号召所有国家参加和批准禁止使用细菌武器与化学武器的日内瓦议定书。
    苏联代表马立克作了全面的发言，详尽地揭露美国企图搁置和拒绝任何防止侵略与防止使用大规模毁灭性武器的建议。他说：美国企图削弱日内瓦议定书的意义，把它说成是过时的和不充分的。美国这种削弱日内瓦议定书的意义的企图是可笑的，这是企图用好听的话来辩解美国不愿意批准议定书以及阻止其他国家批准它的态度。马立克着重指出：美国的态度违反国际法和人类的利益。日内瓦议定书现在和将来都有其国际意义。
    马立克指出：美国政府到现在还没有说过一句反对使用细菌武器的话。美国政府一方面既拒绝谴责罪恶的战争方法，另一方面又不肯说它不打算使用细菌武器。杜鲁门、艾奇逊、美国国会以及所有美国总统逐鹿者对于这个问题都同样保持缄默，没有一个人说过他在原则上反对细菌战争。马立克着重指出：安全理事会不应该忽视这个事实。安全理事会必须吁请没有参加与批准日内瓦议定书的所有国家尽速参加和批准它。美国企图引起大家对日内瓦议定书以及国际义务的履行怀疑，这种企图是值得严重注意的，应该加以谴责。马立克指出：美国所遵奉的政策违反联合国宪章，全世界各国人民都将谴责美国的态度。
    马立克着重指出这个事实：法国及其他国家的代表团已表示支持日内瓦议定书。他说：在这一点上，甚至美国在北大西洋公约中的盟友也拒绝追随美国。安全理事会大多数理事国都表示遵守它们根据日内瓦议定书承担的义务。但是美国统治集团执行准备新战争的政策，力图破坏日内瓦议定书，并且力图煽动其他国家也不遵守议定书的条款。
    马立克说：美国对国际协定与国际义务没有表示应有的尊重。美国不愿受到那些妨碍它的侵略政策、攫取世界霸权政策的协定的约束。美国企图在国际关系上执行“弱肉强食的法则”，但是全世界各国人民都拒绝走这条道路。他援引具体例子，说明美国之所以反对批准日内瓦议定书是因为化学公司、靠制造大规模毁灭性武器而获暴利的“死亡商人”在反对。
    马立克解释道：安全理事会如果批准苏联的提案，将会促进草拟一个更详尽全面的禁止大规模毁灭性武器的协定的工作。如果现在还没有参加和批准日内瓦议定书的国家参加和批准了这个议定书，那末这就是走向和平的一个重要步骤。马立克在结语中要求安全理事会通过苏联的提案，作为草拟一个更详尽全面的禁止一切大规模毁灭性武器的协定之前的初步步骤。
