    Reviewing the Errors We Committed in the Zhang Shunyou Incident
    Shanxi Daily Editorial Department
    The Zhang Shunyou incident exposed serious bureaucratic work styles in the leadership of our Shanxi Daily Editorial Department. It exposed that some of our work systems were unsound and that some cadres had weak mass viewpoints and sense of responsibility. When we initially established the "Reader's Letters Group," we emphasized that "reader's letters" are one of the best ways to connect with the masses, and that reader visits are the primary task of the Reader's Letters Group, enshrining this spirit in the group's work guidelines. However, this spirit was not upheld and implemented. In actual work, there was a reversal of priorities, and reader visits were neglected. On March 13th, when cart driver Zhang Shunyou came to the newspaper to talk, the "Three-Anti" movement was in full swing. Although our newspaper concentrated its efforts on reporting the "Three-Anti" campaign, we failed to consider how to strengthen reader's letters work during the "Three-Anti" movement. On the contrary, we transferred cadres from the Reader's Letters Group, weakening its strength. Therefore, when Zhang Shunyou came to talk, we did not have any leading cadres to receive him, and instead, had Wu Zhendong, a trainee from the data room, temporarily helping with the work, receive him. Wu Zhendong was a new cadre, unfamiliar with the work, lacking a strong mass viewpoint, and unclear about his responsibilities. He not only failed to warmly receive Zhang Shunyou but also failed to report to the group leaders during the conversation. After Zhang Shunyou left, although Wu Zhendong reported to the group leaders, the group leadership had serious tendencies toward focusing only on routine matters, valuing letters over visits, and lacking a mass viewpoint, and they were not concerned enough about the issues raised by the masses and the suffering of the masses. As a result, Zhang Shunyou's problem was not only not seriously addressed but also not reported to higher authorities. This is the root cause of the problem.
    The newspaper is one of the most important tools for connecting with the masses. However, we lacked sufficient understanding of this point, which was reflected in our lack of independent opinions and a serious sense of responsibility regarding important issues such as reader's letters and visits. We often had a mindset of simply relying on the government. When dealing with specific problems, we often acted in this way: for problems handled by lower-level government agencies about which the masses raised objections, we mostly forwarded the opinions of the masses to higher-level leading bodies for handling. As for problems handled by provincial-level government agencies about which the masses again raised objections, we often took a cold attitude due to our mindset of simply relying on the government, even thinking: if the provincial government can't handle it, how can the newspaper handle it? We feared that the individual problems of the masses would damage the prestige of high-level government agencies. At times, we even held a kind of aversion towards visiting readers, thinking that this person "doesn't know how good he has it," and is "deliberately being mischievous with the government." As a result, problems like Zhang Shunyou's were lightly dismissed. This sets up a false dichotomy between trusting the government and being responsible to the masses, and it neglects the supervisory role of the newspaper. This is the second reason why this problem occurred.
    Because our mass viewpoint was not strong, and we neglected the work of reader visits, we have long neglected research and improvement of the systems and methods for reader visits, and we have also long neglected inspecting the existing systems. For example:
    (1) At the beginning of the establishment of the "Reader's Letters" work, it was stipulated that all problems raised in reader's letters and visits must be handled responsibly from beginning to end; reader visits are the most important work of the Reader's Letters Group. However, in the course of implementation, it was tight at first and then loosened. Editors and responsible comrades of the group sometimes treated conversations with visiting readers as an incidental task, placing importance on editing manuscripts and replying to letters, and neglecting conversations with visiting readers. (2) The original system stipulated that all letters forwarded by the newspaper should be answered by the relevant agencies within two months; otherwise, a public prosecution would be filed with the People's Supervisory Agency (this was done before, and the effect was good); however, this system was not maintained. (3) The registration and numbering of reader visits also started off enthusiastically but then cooled down. (4) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China once instructed that the situation of reader's letters and visits work must be reported to the Provincial Committee every month, and important issues must be reported at any time; however, this system was never well implemented. The editorial department's daily attention to checking and urging was only focused on how well the Reader's Letters Group edited the letters published in the newspaper, and how to improve the ideological content of the letters, but it never seriously checked how well the reader visits work was being done, and what problems there were. (5) In addition, in the process of handling reader visits, we often suffered from a shortage of manpower, making it impossible to carry out the necessary investigation work. Because the newspaper is different from the supervisory agency, the supervisory agency can send someone to investigate the problems raised by the people; however, the newspaper does not have such mobile strength, and we often adopted the method of transferring the problems raised by readers to the relevant agencies and higher-level supervisory agencies for handling, especially when such issues are of dubious validity. Sometimes, the transferred problem is transferred to the person concerned. As a result, it is either ignored or comes back with a "not in accordance with the facts" reply; sometimes it is transferred to a higher-level supervisory agency and is also shelved. We have not actively urged for handling, so that the Reader's Letters Group has become a "receiving and forwarding" agency.
    In short, the errors we have committed are serious and intolerable.
    After the Zhang Shunyou incident occurred, the editorial department, the Reader's Letters Group, and relevant personnel conducted a review and expressed their determination to correct the errors. Relevant personnel have also made written self-criticisms. Accepting the lessons of the Zhang Shunyou incident, some systems have now been preliminarily re-established for reader's letters and visits work, and there have been improvements in the work. For example, in May, of the one thousand and twenty-one reader's letters received, 65% were processed (the rest were either with unknown addresses or could not be processed), basically achieving "every letter must be answered." In May, there were fifty-one visiting readers, who raised forty-four issues. Among them, thirty-two cases have been completely resolved; twelve cases have been preliminarily resolved; all problems that the newspaper cannot handle have been reported to the Provincial Committee. Detailed numbering and registration have been made for the problems raised by visiting readers. Major issues are publicly published in the newspaper. In this way, the prestige of the newspaper has greatly increased among the masses. In early June, forty-six people had come to the newspaper to talk, raising twenty-six issues.
    Currently, in addition to organizing a discussion of the Zhang Shunyou incident in the newspaper, we have also decided to conduct a discussion on the Zhang Shunyou incident in the entire editorial department, in order to more deeply expose the bureaucratic work style in past work, and to combine it with improving various work systems to eliminate bureaucracy.

    检讨我们在张顺有事件中所犯的错误
    山西日报编辑部
    张顺有事件暴露了我们山西日报编辑部领导方面是存在着严重的官僚主义作风的，暴露了我们的某些工作制度是不健全的，某些干部的群众观念和职责观念是薄弱的。我们在建立“读者来信组”之初，曾强调提出“读者来信”是联系群众的最好形式之一；而读者来访工作则是读者来信组的首要任务，并把这一精神规定在读者来信组的工作方针之内。但是，这一精神却没有坚持和贯彻下来，在实际工作中发生了轻重倒置的现象，忽视了读者来访工作。三月十三日赶车工人张顺有来报社谈话时，正值“三反”运动紧张进行。本社虽集中力量报道“三反”，但竟未考虑到在“三反”运动中如何加强读者来信工作的问题；相反地倒抽调了读者来信组的干部，减弱了读者来信组的力量。因而当张顺有来谈话时，我们没有主要干部接谈，竟让一个临时从资料室调来帮助工作的练习资料员吴振东接谈。吴振东是个新干部，业务不熟习，群众观念不强，职责观念不明。他不但没有热情招待张顺有，谈话进行中也没有向小组领导同志汇报。张顺有走后，吴振东虽向小组领导同志作了汇报，但由于小组领导方面有严重的事务主义，重来信、轻来访，缺乏群众观念，对群众所提出的问题，对群众的疾苦，不够关切。因之，对张顺有的问题，不但未予认真处理，也没有向上级汇报。这就是问题发生的根本原因。
    报纸是联系群众的最重要的工具之一。但我们对这一点认识不足，表现在对于像读者来信和来访这样的重要问题，缺乏独立见解和认真负责的精神，常常有单纯依赖政府的思想。在处理具体问题时，往往是这样：凡是下级政府机关处理的问题而群众提出意见的，我们多半把群众的意见转给高一级领导机关去处理；至于经过省级政府机关处理的问题而群众又提出意见的，即因有单纯依赖政府的思想，多持冷淡态度，甚至想：省政府还办不了，报纸怎能办得了。我们怕因群众的个别问题，损伤了高级政府机关的威信。有时，甚至对来访的读者抱着一种厌恶情绪，认为这个人“生在福中不知福”，“故意和政府调皮”。因之，像张顺有之类的问题，就轻轻地放过去了。这是把相信政府和对群众负责的观点对立起来，忽视了报纸的监督作用。这是问题发生的第二个原因。
    由于我们的群众观点不强，和忽视读者来访工作，因之，对读者来访工作的制度和方法，长期忽视研究、改进，而对已有的制度，也长期忽视检查。如：
    （一）“读者来信”工作建立之初，曾规定：凡读者来信、来访所提出的问题，必须有始有终地作认真负责的处理；来访工作是读者来信组最重要的工作。但在执行中，先紧后松，编辑以及小组负责同志，有时把和来访读者谈话当成附带任务，重编稿、复信，轻视和来访读者谈话。（二）原来制度规定，凡读者经报社转出的信件，均请有关机关于两个月内答复，否则，即向人民监察机关提起公诉（曾这样做过，效果良好）；但这一制度没有坚持下来。（三）读者来访的登记、编号工作，也是热了一个时期就冷了下来。（四）中共山西省委曾指示，读者来信来访工作的情况，每月必需向省委做汇报，重要的问题须随时汇报；但这一制度始终没有很好执行。编辑部日常所注意检查、督促的也只是读者来信组在报上刊登的来信编得怎么样，如何提高来信的思想性，而从来没有认真地检查一下读者来访工作做得怎么样，有些什么问题。（五）另外，在处理读者来访的问题当中，常苦于人手少，无法进行必要的调查工作。因为报纸不同于监察机关，监察机关对人民所提出的问题，可以派专人进行调查；但报纸没有这样的机动力量，对读者所提出的而又值得怀疑的问题，往往采取转给有关机关和高一级的监察机关处理的办法。转出去的问题，有时是转到当事人手里。结果，不是不理，就是来一个“与事实不符”；有时转到高一级监察机关也被搁置起来。我们也没有积极督促处理，以致使读者来信组成为“收转”机关。
    总之，我们所犯的错误是严重的、不可容忍的。
    张顺有事件发生后，编辑部和读者来信组及有关人员即进行了检讨，表示了改正错误的决心。有关人员并做了书面检讨。接受张顺有事件的教训，现在读者来信、来访工作已重新初步确定了一些制度，工作上并已有了改进。如：五月份读者来信一千零二十一件，有百分之六十五做了处理（其余的或是地址不明或是无法处理），基本上做到了“有信必复”。五月份来访的读者五十一人，他们提出了四十四个问题。其中三十二件已作了彻底处理；十二件做了初步处理；凡报社无法处理的问题，已报告了省委。对读者来访所提出的问题，做了详细的编号、登记。重大问题，都在报纸上公开发表出来。这样，报纸在群众中的威信大大提高。六月上旬，来报社谈话的已有四十六个人，提出了二十六个问题。
    目前，我们除在报纸上组织了张顺有事件的讨论外，并决定在全编辑部进行关于张顺有事件的讨论，以期更深地揭发已往工作中的官僚主义作风，并结合改进各种工作制度，杜绝官僚主义。
