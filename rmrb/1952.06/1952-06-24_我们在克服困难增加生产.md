    We are overcoming difficulties to increase production
    An Chengjun, Manager of a Mine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    The worker comrades of our mine, in a wartime environment, are overcoming all difficulties and completing arduous production tasks.
    In order to complete our production tasks, we have launched several movements. Currently, we are carrying out a vibrant movement to create "production improvers," and a large number of "production improvers" have emerged. This movement has caused the productivity of our mine to increase sharply every day, and each production team has far exceeded its production plan. Due to the launch of this mass movement, young rock driller Zhao Doushi created a new national record and won the highest honor of the working class of the Republic - the title of "Labor Hero"; many other workers have also been awarded medals and prizes by the state.
    At the very beginning of this movement, we encountered many difficulties because machines and other facilities were damaged. However, thanks to the active efforts of Labor Hero Zhao Doushi, we overcame the difficulties, and within a few days, this movement became a mine-wide movement.
    Zhao Doushi is a twenty-five-year-old rock driller. In 1947, he overfulfilled his original work plan by 300%; during the "June 25th" production competition last year, he operated two Д·Б4M type rock drills alone, overfulfilling the standard production volume by 1462%, and has continued to maintain this record, becoming a new national record.
    After Zhao Doushi created a new record, the workers then created a method of working with several machines at the same time. By the beginning of this year, 60% of the rock drillers in our mine could work with two machines, and productivity increased by 60% compared to before.
    At the beginning of this year, Zhao Doushi also applied the
    "parallel blasting method" and "step-by-step mining method" suitable for the rock strata of our mine to his work, creating a new record of mining 37 tons more ore than in June last year.
    Encouraged by Zhao Doushi's production achievements, all workers are determined to carefully study Zhao Doushi's advanced working methods. Rock driller Huang Jinnv went to Zhao Doushi every day after work to listen to Zhao Doushi introduce his working methods. She carefully checked and corrected her work shortcomings. In this way, Huang Jinnv became a model worker who overfulfilled her original daily plan by 800%. Bai Chengguo also applied Zhao Doushi's advanced working methods to his work, and on average, he could overfulfill the standard production volume by 500% every day, and later overfulfilled it by 1100%. Since October last year, tunneling worker Zhang Hongfan has used the "parallel blasting method," which enabled tunneling work to exceed the original standard of 1.65 meters, creating a new tunneling record.
    In order to better organize the increasingly high tide of the production increase movement, the leaders also went directly to the workers and helped them in all aspects, which gave the workers more confidence in the movement. Mine manager Jin Tiezhen personally went down the mine pit and worked with Jin Renguan in order to help Jin Renguan, who had poor skills, and as a result, Jin Renguan's production volume increased tenfold.
    The development of this mass movement has become a guarantee for our factory to continuously improve its output. Last May, a rock drill could produce 5 tons of ore, 6.8 tons in June, and a sharp increase to 18.3 tons in October. This year it will be several times more than last year. The tunneling work is also the same: last May, an average of 40 cm could be tunneled per shift (8 hours), 50 cm in June, 90 cm in December, and it is still rising sharply.
    What has been said above is only one of many movements. Our worker comrades clearly know the role they should play in the great Fatherland Liberation War. We all have a firm belief that we will work hard, increase production, and together with the people of the whole country, resolutely defend the motherland, completely eliminate the invaders, and strive for the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.

    我们在克服困难增加生产
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国某矿山经理　安成浚
    我们矿山的全体工人同志们，在战时环境下，克服着一切困难，完成着艰巨的生产任务。
    为了完成生产任务，我们开展了好几次运动。目前，正在开展着一个热火朝天的创造“生产改进者”的运动，涌现了大批“生产改进者”。这一运动使得我们矿山的生产率每天都在急剧地上升着，每个生产小组都远超过了自己的生产计划。由于开展了这一群众性的运动，青年凿岩工赵斗实创造了全国性的新纪录，荣膺共和国工人阶级的最高荣誉——“劳动英雄”称号；还有许多工人也荣获国家所授予的勋章和奖章。
    这一运动在刚一开始的时候，因为机器和其它一些设施被破坏，遇到了许多困难。但是由于劳动英雄赵斗实的积极努力，我们克服了困难，几天之内，这一运动就成为一个全矿性的大运动了。
    赵斗实是一个二十五岁的凿岩工。在一九四七年，他就超额完成了原订工作计划的百分之三百；去年“六、二五”生产竞赛时，他一个人开动两台Д·Б4M型凿岩机，超额完成了标准生产量百分之一千四百六十二，并继续保持到现在，成为全国性的新纪录。
    赵斗实创造新纪录以后，工人们接着创造了一个人运用好几台机器的工作方法。到今年年初，我们矿山里有百分之六十的凿岩工能运用两台机器工作，生产率比以前又提高了百分之六十。
    赵斗实在今年年初，又将适用于我们矿山岩层的
    “平行式爆破法”和“分阶式采矿法”运用到自己的工作中，创造了比去年六月份多采矿石三十七吨的新纪录。
    被赵斗实的生产成就鼓舞着的全体工人，都下决心精心钻研赵斗实的先进工作法。凿岩工黄谨女每天一下班就跑到赵斗实那里去倾听赵斗实介绍自己的工作方法。她细心地检查、改正自己的工作缺点。这样，黄谨女变成了超额完成每天原订计划百分之八百的模范工人。白城国也将赵斗实的先进工作方法运用到自己的工作中去，平均每天能超额完成标准生产量百分之五百，此后又超额完成了百分之一千一百。掘进工张洪范从去年十月开始，运用了“平行式爆破法”，使掘进工作超过了原定标准一·六五公尺，创造了掘进的新纪录。
    为了更好地组织日益高涨的增产运动，领导者们也直接深入到工人中去，在各方面帮助工人。使工人们对运动更有了信心。金哲俊矿长为了帮助技术较差的金仁观，亲自下矿坑和金仁观一起工作，结果使金仁观的生产量提高了十倍。
    这一群众性运动的开展，成了我们工厂不断提高产量的保证。去年五月份一台凿岩机能生产五吨矿石，六月份就是六·八吨，十月份激增到十八·三吨，今年比去年还要多好几倍。掘进工作也是如此：去年五月份一班（八小时）平均能掘进四十公分，六月份就是五十公分，十二月份是九十公分，目前还在不断地急剧上升。
    上面所说的不过是很多运动中的一种，我们的工人同志们清楚地知道自己在伟大的祖国解放战争中应起的作用。我们都有一个坚定的信念，就是努力工作，提高产量，和全国人民一道，坚决保卫祖国，彻底消灭侵略者，争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利。　　（冰蔚摘译自“民主朝鲜”报）
