    Reader's Letters
    How should we correctly approach economic work?
    Editor's Note: Many economic workers have written to this newspaper, describing their various views on economic work and asking this newspaper to help them resolve their ideological problems.
    In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of the people have received profound education, and a new morality and new atmosphere of active work and honesty have occupied a dominant position in social life. However, there are also some economic workers who, for various reasons, have developed a mindset of not wanting to do economic work. In order to correct this erroneous thinking and rectify attitudes towards economic work, we believe that it is absolutely necessary to launch a broad and in-depth discussion. This newspaper plans to publish letters discussing this issue in the "Reader's Letters" column every Saturday.
    Now, we will first publish four representative letters as a starting point for the discussion. We hope everyone will actively participate in this discussion.
    Li Jiachun writes:
    Some purchasing agents are hesitant in their work
    Comrade Editor: I am a staff member of an enterprise in Shanghai. After the "Three-Anti" movement, most of the comrades here are actively and happily carrying out their work, but a few comrades are not as active as before. They have developed many concerns in their thinking. There is a purchasing agent named Wang Guisheng, who is a new cadre who joined the work in July last year. He has always been active in his work, and no problems were found in the "Three-Anti" movement. However, after the "Three-Anti" movement, Wang Guisheng underwent some changes in his thinking, and his work enthusiasm was far less full than before, and his work became hesitant. He does the work assigned by the leadership, and he does not offer any opinions if the work is not assigned. In order to avoid suspicion, he always pulls a few people along whenever he goes out to buy things; after returning, he repeatedly explains to the leadership. He is now particularly unwilling to contact private merchants, and tries to push the matter of dealing with private merchants to others. He records everything he handles every day in a small notebook. He says that this is done so that "when the 'Three-Anti' comes again in the future, it will be available for comrades to check." Once, I talked to Wang Guisheng about work issues, and asked him why he was not as active as before the "Three-Anti" movement. He said that he was afraid of dealing with private merchants, and if he was not careful, he would be dragged into the water and become a sinner for all time. He said: Some "old cadres" have been hit by the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie, and he has only recently joined the revolution, lacking the training of actual struggle, it is inevitable that he will become a victim of the "sugar-coated bullets." Therefore, it is best not to contact private merchants, so as to avoid problems. I always feel that Wang Guisheng's views are not right, but I have told him a lot of reasons, but it does not move him at all. I hope the editor can help solve Wang Guisheng's ideological problems, or start a discussion in the newspaper.

    Li Jiachun, purchasing staff member, Ma Jingwu says:
    "I don't want to do economic work anymore"
    Comrade Editor: After the "Three-Anti" movement, I don't want to do economic work anymore.
    I have been doing purchasing work in the materials department of the agency for more than six years. I have always been at ease and active, and the leadership trusts me. After entering the city in 1949, I was promoted to head of the materials section. I was not vigilant enough about the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, and I even made friends with several merchants. I accepted the watches and pens they gave me. I mistakenly thought this was a friendly exchange. In the "Three-Anti" movement, I realized that accepting "gifts" from private merchants was wrong. I immediately took the initiative to confess these small acts of bribery to the Party, and conducted a deep examination from the perspective of ideology and position. The organization decided to treat me leniently and not give administrative punishment.
    However, since then, I have had an ideological burden in my heart. I feel that the leadership and comrades do not trust me, and I have no confidence to continue working, and I ask to change careers.
    My thoughts are as follows: (1) The reason why I had bribery behavior was mainly because I had the opportunity to contact private merchants; if I did not contact private merchants, even if my position was not stable, problems would not occur. In order to avoid making mistakes again, I should leave my economic work post. (2) Now the leadership and comrades do not trust me very much. If I stay in my original post, if there is a small mistake, even if it is not corruption or bribery, jumping into the Yellow River will not wash it clean. (3) I have participated in the revolution for eight or nine years, but my political progress is relatively slow. This is directly related to the fact that I do purchasing work, running around all day, busy with affairs, and have no time to study. In order to improve my political level and work ability, and to do more work for the revolution, I should be allowed to transfer jobs.

    Ma Jingwu Hu Dawei writes:
    "Doing general affairs work has no future"
    Comrade Editor: I am a cadre in the general affairs department in charge of construction work. I have been doing this work for three years, but I have never been at ease and always wanted to change careers. This mood of mine has developed even more after the "Three-Anti" movement. I have several ideas: First, general affairs work is too trivial and too boring. Engaging in this line of work is like falling into the mire of bureaucratism. All day long, I am entangled in abacuses, account books, invoices, and transactions with private merchants, busy and running around. Today, I repair the house, tomorrow, I patch the wall, and even when the toilet is broken, they come to us. Therefore, I feel that this job has no future. Second, my work like this is not related to the country's great construction work; no matter how hard I work, it will not benefit the country. Every time I think of the deeds of combat heroes and labor models, I become even more uneasy. Comrade Editor, I am still very young, I have a high degree of enthusiasm, and if I can have a suitable position, I will definitely be able to do something beneficial for the country. But, as it is now, what future development can I have? Third, doing this job, I always feel that I can't hold my head up in front of others. When others look at me, I feel that others are despising me and looking down on me; over time, I also lack confidence in myself.
    In the "Three-Anti" movement, several "tigers" were found in our department. Although I had no problems, I became even more disgusted with economic work. I am determined not to continue doing this line of work, and I hope you can help me solve this problem.

    Hu Dawei Dong Anping writes:
    "Doing economic work inevitably leads to being dragged down by unscrupulous merchants"
    Comrade Editor: I am very lucky that I did not do financial and economic work, so no problems occurred in the "Three-Anti" movement. As the saying goes, "If you stand by the river for a long time, you are bound to get your shoes wet." People who do economic work deal with money and merchants every day, who can guarantee that there will not be a problem?
    However, contrary to my wishes, when the agency adjusted its structure at the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, I was transferred to the financial and economic department. Now I have to handle a lot of money every day and often have to deal with private merchants. I am really scared, I can't guarantee that I will not have problems in the future. Because the methods of attack by奸商[unscrupulous merchants] are very vicious. They will not hesitate to use all despicable, shameless, insidious and vicious means to corrode us and lure us. Some old cadres who have been tempered for a long time have been dragged into the water by them, let alone a retained person like me who has not undergone a thorough transformation? If I am inadvertently dragged into the water by奸商, what will happen to my family of seven or eight? I am very distressed. I want to ask for a transfer, but I am afraid of being criticized, so I am writing to you to ask you to point out a way out for me!

专栏：读者来信

    读者来信
    应该怎样正确地对待经济工作？
    编者按：许多经济工作人员给本报来信，叙述他们对经济工作的各种不同的看法，要求本报帮助他们解决思想问题。
    在“三反”和“五反”运动中，各级干部和广大人民，都受到了深刻的教育，积极工作、廉洁奉公的新道德新风气，已经在社会生活中占了主导的地位。但是，也有一部分经济工作人员，由于种种原因，产生了一种不愿意作经济工作的思想。为了纠正这种错误思想，端正对待经济工作的态度，我们认为，展开一个广泛、深入的讨论，是完全必要的。本报准备以后在每星期六的“读者来信”栏，发表讨论这个问题的来信。
    现在，我们先发表四封有代表性的来信，作为讨论的开始。希望大家踊跃参加这一讨论。
    李加春来信说
    有的采购员在工作上束手束脚
    编辑同志：我是上海某企业单位的一个工作人员。在“三反”运动以后，我们这里的大部分同志，都是积极地愉快地进行工作，但是有少数同志，反倒不如以前积极了。他们在思想上发生了不少的顾虑。有一个叫王贵生的采购员，是去年七月间参加工作的新干部。他一向工作积极，在“三反”运动中，也没有发现什么问题。可是，“三反”运动过后，王贵生在思想上起了一些变化，他的工作热情远不如从前那样饱满了，他的工作变得束手束脚了。领导方面布置了工作他就做，不布置工作他也不提意见。他为了避免嫌疑，每当出去购买东西的时候，总是拉上几个人一块去；回来以后，向领导方面三番五次地作交代。他现在特别不愿意和私商接触，尽量把和私商打交道的事情推给别人。他把自己每天经手的事情，一件件地记录在小本子上。他说这样做是为了“将来再‘三反’时，供同志们查考。”有一次我和王贵生谈起工作问题来，问他为什么不如“三反”前那样积极了。他说，他害怕和私商打交道，一不小心，被拖下水去，成了千古罪人。他说：有些“老干部”都被资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”打中了，自己刚参加革命不久，缺乏实际斗争的锻炼，难免成为“糖衣炮弹”下的牺牲品。因此，最好不和私商接触，以免发生问题。王贵生的看法，我总觉得不对劲，可是我给他讲了好多道理，丝毫不能打动他。我希望编辑同志帮助解决王贵生的思想问题，或者在报上展开讨论。
    李加春采购人员马竞武说
    “以后再不愿做经济工作了”
    编辑同志：“三反”运动以后，我不愿再做经济工作了。
    我在机关里的材料部门，做了六年多采购工作。我一直是安心和积极的，领导方面对我也信任。一九四九年入城后，我被提拔为材料科科长。我对不法资产阶级分子的进攻警惕不够，竟和几个商人作了朋友。他们送给我的手表、钢笔，我都收下了。我错误地认为这是朋友间的人情往来。在“三反”运动中，我认识到接受私商“礼物”是错误的。我立即主动地向党坦白交代了这些小的受贿行为，并且从思想和立场上进行了深刻的检查。组织上决定对我从宽处理，不给行政处分。
    但是，从此以后，我心里就有了一个思想包袱。我觉得领导方面和同志们对我不信任了，我也没有信心再工作下去了，我要求改行。
    我的想法是这样的：（一）我所以发生了受贿行为，主要是因为我和私商有了接触的机会；如果不和私商接触，即使立场不稳，也不会发生问题。为了避免再犯错误，我应该离开经济工作岗位。（二）现在领导方面和同志们对我是不很信任的。如果我还留在原工作岗位上，万一出上一点小差错，即使不是贪污受贿，跳到黄河里也是洗不清的。（三）我参加革命已经八九年了，但在政治上的进步是比较慢的。这和我做采购工作，成天跑腿，忙于事务，没有学习时间是有直接关系的。为了提高我的政治水平和工作能力，为革命做更多的工作，应该允许我调动工作。
    马竞武胡大为来信说
    “做总务工作是没有前途的”
    编辑同志：我是一个在总务部门负责修建工作的干部。我做这个工作已经有三年了，但是一直不安心，总想改行。我的这种情绪，在“三反”运动以后，更加发展了。我有这样几种想法：第一，总务工作太琐碎、太枯燥，干上这一行，就等于陷进了事务主义的泥坑。整天纠缠在算盘、账本、发票和私商的交易中，忙忙碌碌，跑东跑西。今天修修房，明天补补墙，连厕所坏了，都来找我们。因此，我觉得这个工作没有出息。第二，像我这样的工作和国家的伟大建设工作是结合不上的；自己再卖力气，对国家也没有什么好处。我每次想起战斗英雄和劳动模范的各种事迹，就更加不安心了。编辑同志，我还很年青，我有高度的热情，我如果能有一个适合的岗位，一定可以为国家干些有益的事。可是，像现在这样，我能有什么发展前途呢？第三，做了这个工作，我总觉得在别人面前抬不起头来。别人看我一眼，我都觉得别人是轻视我，看不起我；时间长了，我对自己也就缺乏自信了。
    在“三反”运动中，我们这个部门里发现了几只“老虎”。虽然我没有什么问题，可是，我对经济工作更加厌烦了。我决心不再继续干这一行了，希望你们帮助我解决这个问题。
    胡大为董安平来信说
    “做经济工作难免被奸商拉下水去”
    编辑同志：我很幸运，我没有做财经工作，所以在“三反”运动中没有发生问题。俗话说得好：“久在河边站，那能不湿鞋。”做经济工作的人，每天和金钱、商人打交道，谁能保险不发生一点问题呢？
    可是，事与愿违。在“三反”结束，机关调整机构时，我被调到财经部门了。现在我每天要经手很多钱，经常要和私商打交道。我真害怕，我不敢保险自己将来不发生问题。因为奸商们进攻的手段是非常毒辣的，他们不惜用尽一切卑鄙无耻和阴险毒辣的手段，腐蚀我们，引诱我们。有些久经锻炼的老干部尚且被他们拉下水去，何况我这样一个没有经过彻底改造的留用人员？如果万一不慎，被奸商拉下了水，我一家老小七八口怎么办呢？我非常苦恼，有心要求调动工作，又怕受批评，所以我给你们写信，请你们给我指出一条出路吧！
      董安平
