    Guarantee Reasonable Grain Prices and Safeguard the Interests of Farmers
    State-Owned Grain Companies Across the Country Launch New Wheat Purchasing Work
    New wheat is being successively brought to market across the country. This year, the national wheat output is estimated to increase by 15% compared to last year, and the majority of farmers are eager to sell their new wheat in order to exchange it for various means of production and necessities of life. Therefore, the state's wheat purchase plan this year is 40% larger than last year. At present, state-owned grain companies and cooperatives in various regions have begun purchasing new wheat.
    State-owned grain companies in various regions have implemented the policy of "purchasing large quantities, completing the plan, guaranteeing reasonable prices, and purchasing in both urban and rural areas." In May, they successively convened various meetings to arrange purchasing tasks based on instructions from higher authorities and in light of the specific conditions in their respective regions.
    Currently, the purchasing of new wheat has begun in all wheat-producing areas except for the Northeast region, where the wheat harvest season is later and purchasing arrangements have not yet been made. Branch companies of the grain company in the Central and Southern regions have widely signed purchasing contracts with cooperatives at all levels to prepare for large-scale purchases. In the Eastern China region, wheat production this year has increased by more than 15% compared to last year. Wheat has been brought to market in large quantities in Zhejiang, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, and Anhui. Wheat in Shandong Province is also being successively brought to market. Grain companies in the Taizhou and Yancheng special districts of Northern Jiangsu have universally started purchasing, and the masses have reacted favorably due to reasonable listed prices and timely purchases. In Southern Jiangsu, grain companies at all levels, in addition to directly purchasing in cities and central towns, mainly rely on cooperatives to carry out purchases and have greatly increased the number of purchasing stations to complete the purchasing tasks. Shandong's wheat production this year has increased by 32.85% compared to last year, and it is generally estimated that marketable wheat this year will increase by 54% compared to last year. Grain companies at all levels in Shandong Province have extracted a considerable number of cadres to form joint roving inspection teams at each level to go to various places to supervise and inspect the work of cooperatives in purchasing new wheat on their behalf, and to promptly solve problems that arise in the purchasing process to ensure the completion of the purchasing tasks. Wheat production in the Northern China region this year is estimated to increase by about 25% compared to last year, and this year's purchasing plan is 50% larger than last year. The Pingyuan Province Grain Company and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed an agreement for the cooperative purchasing of grain in mid-May. Grain companies at all levels in Hebei Province have also universally established cooperative purchasing relationships with county cooperatives, requiring cooperatives to purchase 70% of the total purchasing volume on their behalf. At present, new wheat is being successively brought to market in the wheat-producing areas of Hebei and Pingyuan, and purchasing has begun in some areas.
    In the process of purchasing new wheat, grain companies and other specialized companies and cooperatives in various regions have carried out a series of linked businesses, on one hand purchasing new wheat from farmers, and on the other hand supplying farmers with necessities. Grain companies in various regions of the Central and Southern regions have allocated large quantities of rice to supply farmers. Grain companies in various regions of the Northern China region have supplied large quantities of coarse grains to meet the farmers' demand for exchanging fine grains for coarse grains. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu have allocated large quantities of daily-use industrial products and pest control equipment to fully supply farmers.
    In the work of purchasing new wheat, individual regional grain companies are not actively educating farmers to thresh and dry their wheat and sell it to the state, but instead are emphasizing that the moisture content of the new wheat is too high and that it is not easy to preserve, and are not actively purchasing it, which has led to low market prices and excessive seasonal price differences, creating opportunities for private merchants to speculate and profit. These biases should be corrected in a timely manner to safeguard the interests of the broad masses of farmers.

    保证合理粮价维护农民利益
    全国各地国营粮食公司开展新麦收购工作
    全国各地新麦陆续上市。今年全国小麦产量，估计比去年增加百分之十五，大多数农民急待出售新麦，以换取各种生产资料和生活资料。因此，国家今年收购小麦计划，比去年增大百分之四十。目前各地国营粮食公司和合作社已开始收购新麦。
    各地国营粮食公司贯彻了“大量收进、完成计划、保证合理价格、实行城乡兼收”的方针，在五月份先后召开了各种会议，根据上级指示，结合本区具体情况，布置了收购任务。
    现在全国产麦区除东北区因麦收季节较晚，尚未布置收购外，其他地区收购新麦工作都已开始。中南区粮食公司所属各省、市分支公司，已和各级合作社广泛签订了代购合同，准备大量收购。华东区今年小麦产量较去年增加百分之十五以上。浙江、苏南、苏北、安徽等地小麦已大量上市。山东省小麦亦陆续登场。苏北泰州、盐城两专区粮食公司已普遍开始收购，由于牌价合理，收购及时，群众反映良好。苏南区各级粮食公司除在城市和中心市镇直接进行收购外，主要依靠合作社进行收购，并大量增设收购站，以完成收购任务。山东今年小麦产量较去年增加百分之三十二点八五，一般估计今年商品小麦可比去年增加百分之五十四。山东省各级粮食公司抽出相当数量的干部，逐级组成联合巡回检查组，赴各地督促检查合作社代购新麦工作，及时解决代购中发生的问题，以保证完成收购任务。华北区今年小麦产量约比去年增加百分之二十五，今年收购计划比去年增大百分之五十。平原省粮食公司和省供销合作社在五月中签订了代购粮食协议。河北省各级粮食公司也和县合作社普遍建立了代购关系，要求合作社代购数量占收购总数的百分之七十。目前河北、平原产麦区新麦陆续上市，部分地区已开始收购。
    在收购新麦过程中，各地粮食公司和其他专业公司及合作社开展了连环业务，一面收购农民的新麦，一面供应农民以必需品。中南区各地粮食公司，拨出大批稻谷，供应农民。华北区各地粮食公司大量供应粗粮，满足农民以细粮换粗粮的要求。苏南、苏北各国营贸易公司和合作社调配大批日用工业品和灭虫器械，充分供应农民。
    在收购新麦工作中，个别地区粮食公司不是积极地教育农民把麦子扬净晒干卖给国家，而是强调新麦水分太大，不易保管，而不积极收购，以致市场价格偏低，季节差价过大，给私商造成投机牟利的机会。这些偏向应该及时纠正，以维护广大农民的利益。
