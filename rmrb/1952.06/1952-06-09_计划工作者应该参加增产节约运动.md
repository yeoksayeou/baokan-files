    Planning Workers Should Participate in the Production Increase and Economy Practice Movement

    Editor: Some personnel in the planning section of the Basic Construction Department of the Shenyang Electrical Engineering Bureau used to think that the planning section was not a production department, so there was no "increase production" to speak of; and there was no waste in the section, so there was no "economy" to speak of. This idea is obviously wrong. Planning work is an extremely important job, and it is closely related to the production department. A slight mistake may cause huge waste. After studying the documents on carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement, the comrades in the planning section have ideologically clarified the importance of planning work to the production increase and economy practice movement. All personnel are ready to learn from advanced experience and exert the effectiveness of planning work. We have meticulously drawn up our work plan so that all production departments can carry out the production increase and economy practice movement step by step according to this plan. I suggest that staff in other planning departments should not ignore the role of planning work and should take practical actions to participate in the production increase and economy practice movement.

    计划工作者应该参加增产节约运动
    编辑同志：我们沈阳市电工局基本建设处计划科部分人员，过去认为计划科不是生产部门，谈不上“增产”；科里没有浪费，也谈不上“节约”。这种想法显然是错误的。计划工作是一种极为重要的工作，它和生产部门有密切的联系，稍微做错一点，就可能造成巨大的浪费。计划科的同志们学习了有关开展增产节约运动的文件，都在思想上明确了计划工作对增产节约运动的重要意义。全体人员都准备学习先进经验，发挥计划工作的效能。我们已经精细地订出了我们的工作计划，使各生产部门能够按照这个计划，有步骤地开展增产节约运动。我建议其他计划部门的工作人员，不要忽略计划工作的作用，要以实际行动投入到增产节约运动中来。               颜永仪
