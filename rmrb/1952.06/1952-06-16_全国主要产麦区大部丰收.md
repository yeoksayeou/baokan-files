Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: The wheat harvest has been basically completed across the country. Major wheat-producing areas have largely achieved bumper harvests. Preliminary estimates suggest that the total national wheat output this year will increase by approximately 15% compared to last year. This is the first victory in this year's grain production increase. The increased output is due to the expansion of wheat field acreage and the increase in yield per unit area. This year, the wheat field acreage increased by more than 6% compared to last year, and the national average yield per mu (0.067 hectares) of wheat fields increased by approximately 8% compared to last year.

The major wheat-producing areas across the country, including Pingyuan Province and Hebei Province in North China, Shandong Province, Subei (Northern Jiangsu) and Sunan (Southern Jiangsu) regions in East China, Henan Province in Central South China, and Shaanxi Province in Northwest China, have all had good wheat harvests this year. East China has achieved bumper wheat harvests in almost all areas. On a national scale, the best wheat harvests this year were in Pingyuan Province in North China, and Shandong Province, Subei, and Sunan regions in East China. These were followed by Shaanxi Province, Northern Anhui, and Henan Province. Pingyuan Province has achieved a bumper harvest this year, unseen for many years. The average yield per unit area of wheat in the province increased by 38% compared to last year. The wheat yields of state-owned farms and high-yield model farmers in the province generally ranged from 400 to 900 jin (200-450 kg) per mu. The average yield per mu in Shandong Province is approximately 110 jin; the wheat yield per mu in the Subei region reached 120 to 200 jin; the wheat yield in both regions generally increased by more than 20% compared to last year. The wheat yield in the Sunan region also increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The overall wheat yield in East China increased by 10% compared to last year. More than 50 counties in Henan Province suffered from insect pests this year, and the wheat harvest in central and western Henan was not as good as last year. However, the wheat in the Huaiyang area of eastern Henan increased by 10% compared to last year; the harvest in the Xinyang area was also not bad. On a provincial scale, the wheat yield was about the same as last year. Although Shaanxi Province suffered from disasters such as insects and wind this spring, the harvest was better than last year. The wheat harvest in many areas in the Huai River basin of Northern Anhui was also better than last year. The areas with poor wheat harvests this year were mainly in Southwest China. The wheat harvest in Shanxi Province in North China was also not as good as last year. The wheat in Shanxi Province was originally growing well and expected to have a bumper harvest, but it suffered from wind, insects, and other disasters during the period before it was about to ripen, resulting in reduced output. However, on the scale of the entire North China region, wheat production still increased compared to last year. Due to the severe drought in Southwest China last winter and this spring, the wheat yield per unit area this year is very low, but because the wheat field acreage has increased significantly compared to last year, the total wheat output in Southwest China this year is still higher than last year.

The areas along the Huai River in eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu have achieved their second bumper wheat harvest since the Huai River harnessing project. Three million farmers in the Suxian area of Anhui Province have again victoriously harvested this year's wheat. The 13,948,000 mu of wheat and barley in the area have all achieved bumper harvests: the average wheat yield per mu in Lingbi, Suxian, Huaiyuan and other counties is more than 100 jin, among which the wheat in Dahewancun in Huaiyuan, and Laowanghu in Suxian, and Chanhucun in Lingbi, which had not yielded any crops for ten years before the Huai River harnessing project, grew more than half a person tall this year, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu. In the Huaiyin area of Subei, due to the Huai River harnessing and Yi River diversion projects, the wheat was not only spared from floods but also received irrigation. As a result, the wheat harvest on both sides of the river generally increased by more than 20% compared to last year. The Zhangji area of Pixui County, which had suffered from floods for seven consecutive years without any harvest, saw an increase of 6,846,000 jin of wheat this year on its 117,000 mu of wheat land compared to last year.

This year, farmers in various regions paid attention to weeding, topdressing, and pest control in wheat fields, ensuring the wheat harvest. All wheat fields in Pingyuan Province were weeded once, and some areas were weeded two to three times, and some mutual aid teams and high-yield households weeded more than five times. More than 50 counties in Henan Province suffered from serious aphid, red spider, and other insect pests, but under the leadership of people's governments at all levels, the vast number of farmers vigorously captured and killed the pests, quickly eliminating them. This spring, the Huaibei region of Anhui Province had 70 consecutive days of rain and snow. 277,000 mu of wheat seedlings in nine counties of the Suxian area were submerged in water. The counties organized more than 65,000 farmers to dig 141 large ditches with a total length of 650 li (325 km), diverting the water into the Sui, Wo, and other rivers, and rescued more than 247,000 mu of wheat seedlings. These wheat fields achieved good harvests this year. The popularization of improved varieties and the promotion of seed soaking and seed dressing methods during wheat planting also played a significant role in the bumper wheat harvest. However, due to the fact that the close planting method for wheat has not yet been promoted and sparse planting is common in various regions, the wheat yield per unit area this year is still relatively low and can be greatly increased. During this year's wheat harvest, farmers in various regions have paid attention to wheat appraisal and seed selection in the fields, and governments at all levels have also paid attention to summarizing and promoting the experience of wheat high-yield production. All of this has laid a good foundation for increasing the unit area yield of wheat next year.

### 全国主要产麦区大部丰收

    全国主要产麦区大部丰收
    【新华社十四日讯】全国麦收基本上已经完成。主要产麦区大部获得丰收。今年全国小麦的总产量，初步估计比去年约可增加百分之十五左右。这是今年粮食增产的第一个胜利。增产的原因，是由于麦田面积扩大和单位面积产量提高了。今年麦田面积比去年扩大百分之六强，全国麦田产量平均每亩比去年提高了约百分之八。
    全国主要产麦区，华北区平原省和河北省，华东区山东省、苏北和苏南区，中南区河南省，西北区陕西省等地，今年的小麦收成都好。华东差不多全区小麦都获得了丰收。就全国说，今年麦收最好的是华北的平原省，华东的山东省、苏北区和苏南区。其次是陕西省、皖北和河南省。平原省今年获得了多年来未有的大丰收。全省小麦平均单位面积产量，比去年提高了百分之三十八。该省国营农场和丰产模范的小麦，每亩产量一般都在四百斤到九百斤之间。山东全省平均每亩产量约在一百一十斤左右；苏北区每亩小麦产量达一百二十到二百斤；两区的小麦较去年普遍增产二成以上。苏南区的小麦，产量也比去年增产了一成到二成。整个华东小麦，比去年增产一成。河南省今年全省五十多县的麦田曾遭虫害，豫中和豫西各地的小麦收成不如去年。但豫东淮阳专区的小麦比去年增产了一成；信阳专区的收成也不坏。就全省说，小麦产量和去年差不多。陕西省麦田今春虽然也有虫、风等灾害，但收成比去年好。皖北淮河流域许多地方，麦收也比去年好。今年麦收不好的地区，主要是西南区。华北山西省麦收也不如去年。山西省小麦本来生长良好，可望丰收，但在快要成熟期间遭受风、虫等灾而减产。但是，就华北全区说，小麦产量仍比去年增加。西南区由于去冬今春酷旱，今年小麦单位面积产量很低，但因为麦田面积比去年扩大很多，因此今年西南区的小麦总产量仍比去年多些。
    豫东、皖北和苏北淮河两岸，今年获得治淮以来的第二次小麦丰收。安徽省宿县专区三百万农民，又胜利地收割了今年的麦子。该区的一千三百九十四万八千亩小麦和大麦都获得丰收：灵璧、宿县、怀远等县每亩平均产麦在一百斤以上，其中怀远的大河湾，和治淮以前十年不收的宿县老汪湖，灵璧的禅湖等地，今年麦子长得半人多高，平均每亩收获量在二百斤以上。苏北淮阴专区由于治淮和导沂，不仅使小麦免于水灾，并得到了灌溉，因而，今年两岸的麦收普遍比去年增产二成以上。连续七年遭受水灾而不收棵粒的邳睢县张集区，今年十一万七千多亩麦地，比去年增产六百八十四万六千斤小麦。
    今年各地农民都注意了麦田锄草和追肥、除虫等工作，保证了麦子的收获。平原省所有麦田都普锄一遍，有些地区锄到二遍到三遍，有些互助组和丰产户锄到五遍以上。河南省五十多县的小麦遭受了严重的蚜虫、红蜘蛛等害虫，但经各级人民政府领导广大农民大力捕打，很快消灭了害虫。今年春季安徽省淮北地区曾连下七十天雨雪，宿县专区九个县的二十七万七千亩麦苗浸在水中，各县组成了六万五千多农民，挖了长达六百五十里的一百四十一条大沟，将水引入濉、涡等河，救出了二十四万七千多亩麦苗。这些麦子今年获得了好的收成。良种普及工作和种麦时浸种、拌种方法的推广，对小麦的丰收也有很大的作用。但由于小麦密植法仍未推广，各地普遍稀植，因而今年小麦单位面积产量仍然较低，还可大大提高。今年麦收期间，各地农民已注意小麦评比和田间选种等工作，各级政府也很注意总结和推广小麦丰产经验的工作。这都为明年小麦单位面积增产打下了良好的基础。
