(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 21st) At the Korean armistice talks delegates meeting on the 21st, our chief representative, General Nam Il, sternly condemned the other side's rude provocation and childishly ridiculous action of unilaterally announcing an adjournment for the meeting once again on the 17th. General Nam Il pointed out that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved on the basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention. The other side's so-called "screening" aims to detain prisoners of war, which fundamentally violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention. We will never agree to the so-called "re-screening" in any form, in any place, at any time, under the auspices of any institution, nor will any truly neutral country be willing to support the other side's method of detaining prisoners of war, and going to the other side's prisoner of war camps to act as the other side's puppets. Based on the agreement that both sides guarantee that prisoners of war will no longer participate in the Korean War so that they can return home to live peaceful lives, we have put forward a compromise plan that fully complies with the Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation.

    朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会昨日举行
    我痛斥美方片面休会的挑衅行动
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军痛斥对方在十七日又一次片面宣布休会的无礼挑衅和幼稚可笑的行动。南日将军指出，战俘遣返问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决。对方的所谓“甄别”旨在扣留战俘，根本违反了日内瓦公约的规定。我方绝不同意在任何形式下，在任何地方，在任何时间，在任何机构主持下的所谓“再甄别”，也绝不会有任何真正的中立国家愿意支持对方扣留战俘的办法，而到对方战俘营去充当对方的傀儡。我方根据双方保证战俘不再参加朝鲜战争，以便回家过和平生活的协议，提出了完全符合于日内瓦公约的折衷方案。我方五月二日方案是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。
