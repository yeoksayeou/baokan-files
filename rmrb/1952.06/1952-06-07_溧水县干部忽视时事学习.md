    Lishui County Cadres Neglect Current Affairs Studies

    To the Editor: The phenomenon of cadres in various agencies in Lishui County, Southern Jiangsu, neglecting current affairs and political studies is quite common and serious. Recently, we conducted a test in county-level agencies, with a total of 229 cadres participating. The test revealed: First, many cadres have long neglected political study and lack basic political knowledge. For example, 174 people in the test did not understand the nature of the Chinese Communist Party, mistakenly believing that "the Chinese Communist Party is a party led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and united with the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie." The head of the Production and Construction Section, the head of the Industry and Commerce Section, the director of the Taxation Bureau, and the director of the Grain Company of the County People's Government also answered this question incorrectly. Second, they are indifferent to the policies of the Party and the People's Government in the current political movements. 210 people did not know the basic principles for dealing with corrupt elements; the deputy director of the County Public Security Bureau, Pan Jiuzhu, also answered this question incorrectly. 121 people answered the basic principles of agricultural production this year incorrectly. This situation shows that many cadres are working blindly without understanding the policies, which is very dangerous. Third, some people are indifferent to domestic and international current events. For example, only ten people answered correctly about the obstacles encountered in the Korean armistice negotiations. In addition, many cadres lack the necessary understanding of the issue of bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism.

    Of the 229 people who participated in the test, only 46 passed, and most cadres failed. Judging from the test scores, leading cadres did worse than ordinary comrades, and enterprise departments did worse than other departments. This situation is worth noting.

    Based on the above situation, the Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that it is necessary to immediately strengthen the current affairs and political study of cadres, improve their ideological understanding and policy level, so as to better promote various tasks. Therefore, first, a mobilization for study was carried out at the general meeting of all机关干部, using the results of this test to illustrate the importance of current affairs and political study; and the latest documents for current affairs study were designated, stipulating that 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM every day is the fixed study time for various agencies.

                                    Propaganda Department of the Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

### 溧水县干部忽视时事学习

    溧水县干部忽视时事学习
    编辑同志：苏南溧水县各机关干部忽视时事和政治学习的现象，是相当普遍而严重的。最近，我们在县级各机关进行了一次测验，参加测验的干部共二百二十九人。从测验中可以看出：第一，很多机关干部长期忽视政治学习，缺乏起码的政治常识。如：测验中有一百七十四人对中国共产党的性质不了解，他们错误地认为“中国共产党是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的，团结民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的政党”。县人民政府的生产建设科长、工商科长、税务局长、粮食公司的主任对这一问题也答错了。第二，对党和人民政府在当前政治运动中的政策漠不关心。有二百一十人不知道处理贪污分子的基本原则，县公安局副局长潘久珠对这一问题也没有答对。对今年农业生产的基本方针，有一百二十一人答错了。这种情况说明，不少干部是在不了解政策的情况下盲目地工作着，这是十分危险的。第三，有些人对于国内、外的时事问题不闻不问。如关于朝鲜停战谈判受到了什么阻挠的问题，只有十个人答对。此外，还有很多干部对美帝国主义进行细菌战的问题，缺乏应有的认识。
    参加测验的二百二十九人，只有四十六人及格，大部分干部是不及格的。从测验成绩上看，领导干部不如一般同志好，企业部门不如其他部门好。这种情况是值得注意的。
    根据以上情况，中共溧水县委员会认为必须立即加强干部的时事和政治学习，提高干部的思想认识和政策水平，以便更好地推动各项工作。因此，首先在全体机关干部大会上进行了学习动员，以此次测验的结果说明时事和政治学习的重要性；并且指定了最近时事学习的文件，规定每天上午七时至八时半为各机关固定学习时间。
