    The Korean People's Struggle for Peace
    Park Chung-hee, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace

    For nearly two years, the Korean people have taken up arms to fight against the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism in order to defend the freedom, independence, and peace of their motherland. During these two years, the Korean people have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, which has superior equipment and numbers, thwarting their conspiracy to use Korea as a springboard to launch a war of aggression against the whole of Asia and the world. In this regard, Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out in his article "Proletarian Internationalism and the Struggle of the Korean People": "The disastrous failure of the American aggression plan in Korea has forced the war-mongers to consider the possible consequences of military adventures. There is no doubt that in the plans of the American ruling clique, the invasion of Korea and China was an important move to launch a third world war. If the Third World War has not become a reality, it is not because the American ruling group does not want to promote its realization, but because the sudden turn of events in Korea frightened them, and the wise policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China prevented the continued expansion of the Korean conflict. We are proud that our people have heroically repelled the attacks of the American aggressors and have made an important contribution to preventing the outbreak of the Third World War."

    Today, the struggle of the Korean people, who are fighting heroically on the front lines against the American aggressors, is significant not only for the Korean people's defense of their motherland's freedom, independence, and peace, but also is inextricably linked to the peace and security of Asia and the world. The heroic struggle of the Korean people "plays a great role in delaying the Third World War which is being frantically prepared by American imperialism" (Kim Il-sung). Therefore, peace-loving and kind people all over the world, headed by the great Soviet Union and China, regard the suffering of the Korean people as their own suffering, and the victory of the Korean people as their own victory.

    As is well known, during our temporary retreat, the great Chinese people, with the firm will of "saving the neighbor is saving oneself" and "to defend the motherland, we must aid the Korean people," launched a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and at the same time sent the Chinese People's Volunteers to participate in the war in Korea. The direct involvement of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front has further strengthened our forces, not only making the situation more favorable to us, but also giving the American armed interventionists a fatal blow with the combined strength of the Korean and Chinese people, and making the future of their policy of aggression in Asia even more bleak.

    The International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, which came to Korea to investigate the U.S. atrocities of using bacteriological weapons, made a very correct conclusion: "The Korean matter cannot be seen as an isolated event, but as a stage in the development of an actual war, a stage that may endanger the entire world and plunge the whole world into the abyss of war." In fact, the heroic struggle of the Korean people is to defend their motherland; at the same time, we can proudly say that it has also made an important contribution to the great cause of world peace and security. Therefore, the Korean people, regardless of any atrocities, bombings, shelling by naval guns, or even the outrageous inhuman bacteriological warfare and any massacres by U.S. imperialism, will never yield. The front and rear are firmly united and continue to wage a heroic struggle toward the final victory.

    Although the U.S. imperialist aggressors have suffered a disastrous defeat under the joint blows of the Korean and Chinese people, they are still attempting to expand the Korean War at all costs. As everyone knows, they were forced to conduct Korean armistice negotiations when they suffered an irretrievable defeat. During the eleven months of armistice negotiations, they used all kinds of despicable means to delay and obstruct, in an attempt to maintain the tense situation. On the other hand, in order to promote the revival of Japanese militarism, they concluded a one-sided "peace treaty with Japan," as well as the so-called "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement" and the Japan-Taiwan "Peace Treaty." In order to prepare for a new war of aggression on a larger scale, they have also established military bases in many parts of Asia.

    Under such circumstances, the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, initiated by famous Chinese peace fighters Soong Ching Ling and Guo Moruo, is a very timely measure. The peace-loving and peace-longing Korean people welcome and warmly support this. The Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace has appointed representatives to attend the preparatory meeting. While sending representatives to attend the preparatory meeting, it has also widely publicized and explained the significance of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to the people. At present, mass meetings and forums in support of this conference are being held in every corner of Korea.

    In this way, in a very short period of time, more than 13 million Korean people signed the Stockholm Appeal; in November 1950, during the arduous war, the Korean people also launched a support movement for the declaration of the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw, and the entire people actively participated in this movement as one person. In addition, the Korean people have also actively signed their names to the declaration of the World Peace Council calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact. In this way, the Korean people are showing their desire to love peace and long for peace.

    The Korean people will resolutely smash the U.S. aggressors' criminal conspiracy of a new war, safeguard the great cause of peace and security, and devote all their efforts to the success of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    Today's peace movement is growing magnificently in countries around the world and has achieved great success. I believe that with the efforts of the people of the Asian and Pacific region, regardless of race, religious belief, or political views, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be a success. Peace will surely triumph over war, and peace will surely be maintained and consolidated! (Translated by Bing Wei)

    朝鲜人民为和平的斗争
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长  朴正爱
    朝鲜人民为了保卫自己祖国的自由、独立与和平，反对美国帝国主义的武装侵略，拿起武器斗争已为期将近两年了。两年当中，朝鲜人民沉重地打击了在装备、数量上占优势的敌人，使得它们企图以朝鲜为跳板进而向全亚洲及全世界展开侵略战争的阴谋受到了挫折。对此，金日成同志在“无产阶级国际主义与朝鲜人民的斗争”一文中指出：“美国侵略计划在朝鲜的惨遭失败使得战争贩子们不得不考虑到军事冒险的可能后果。毫无疑问，在美国帝国主义的计划中，侵略朝鲜和中国是发动第三次世界大战的重要一着。如果第三次世界大战没有成为事实，并不是因为美国统治集团不想促其实现，而是因为朝鲜局势的急转直下把它们吓慌了，以及苏联和中华人民共和国的英明政策制止了朝鲜冲突的继续扩大。我们引以自豪的就是我们的人民英勇地击退了美国侵略者的进攻，对于制止第三次世界大战的爆发，也作了重要的贡献。”
    今天站在反对美国侵略者的最前哨而英勇战斗的朝鲜人民的斗争，其意义不仅是局限于朝鲜人民为了保卫自己祖国的自由、独立与和平，而是与亚洲、全世界的和平与安全有着不可分离的关联性。朝鲜人民的英雄的斗争是“起着延缓美帝国主义疯狂准备着的第三次世界大战的伟大的作用”（金日成）。因此，以伟大的苏联和中国为首的全世界爱好和平的善良的人们，将朝鲜人民的苦难看成为自己的苦难，将朝鲜人民的胜利看成为自己的胜利。
    如所周知，在我们暂时撤退的时期，伟大的中国人民在“救邻自救”、“要保卫祖国，必须援助朝鲜人民”的坚定意志下，展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，同时并派遣中国人民志愿军到朝鲜参战。由于英勇的中国人民志愿军直接出动朝鲜前线，更加壮大了我们的力量，不但使得形势变得对我们有利，而且朝、中两国人民联合起来的力量给予美国武装干涉者以致命的打击，并使得它们对亚洲的侵略政策的前途愈加暗淡了。
    为了调查美国使用细菌武器的暴行而到朝鲜来的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团，曾做了一个十分正确的结论：“朝鲜的事情不能看作孤立的事件，而是一个实际战争发展的一个阶段，这个阶段可能危及整个世界，使全世界陷入战争的深渊。”事实上朝鲜人民英勇的斗争，是保卫自己的祖国；同时，我们也可以骄傲地说，也是为世界和平与安全的伟大事业作了重要的贡献。因此，朝鲜人民丝毫不顾美帝国主义的任何暴行、轰炸、舰炮轰击，甚至激起公愤的灭绝人性的细菌战以及任何大屠杀。绝不屈服，前方与后方坚固地结成为一体，向着最后的胜利继续进行着英雄的斗争。
    美帝国主义侵略者虽然在朝、中两国人民共同打击下遭到了惨败，但是还在不惜一切地妄图扩大朝鲜战争。大家都知道，它们在遭到不可挽救的惨败的时候，迫不得已才进行朝鲜停战谈判。在停战谈判进行了达十一个月的期间中，它们用尽了一切拖延、阻挠的卑鄙手段，企图继续保持紧张局面。另一方面，并为了促使日本军国主义复活，缔结了片面的“对日和约”，以及所谓“美日行政协定”、日台“和平条约”等。为了准备更大规模地发动新的侵略战争，它们并在亚洲的很多地方建立了军事基地。
    在这样的形势下，由于中国著名的和平战士宋庆龄、郭沫若等的发起，这次在此地召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议，是非常适合时宜的一个措施。对此，酷爱和平、渴望和平的朝鲜人民是非常欢迎和热烈拥护的。朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会指定了出席筹备会议的代表，在与派遣代表出席筹备会议同时，并对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义，广泛地向人民进行宣传与解释。目前朝鲜的任何一个角落里都在开着支持此次会议的群众大会和座谈会。
    像这样，朝鲜人民在很短的期间内，即有一千三百余万名在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名；在战争艰苦的一九五○年十一月，朝鲜人民对在华沙召开的第二次世界和平大会宣言也展开了支持运动，全体人民像一个人似地积极地参加了这一运动。此外，对世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言，朝鲜人民也都积极地签上了自己的名字。朝鲜人民就是这样显示着酷爱和平、渴望和平的意愿。
    朝鲜人民将坚决粉碎美国侵略者犯罪的新战争阴谋，维护着为和平与安全的伟大的事业；为了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成功，将献出一切力量。
    今天的和平运动正在世界各国波澜壮阔地成长着，获得了巨大的成就。我相信：在不分人种、宗教信仰及政治见解的亚洲及太平洋区域的人民的努力下，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议一定会开得成功。和平定能战胜战争，和平定能维护，定能巩固！       （冰蔚译）
