The Wang Yunting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dalai County, Heilongjiang Province, completed the sowing of seventy-two *qing* of farmland by May 15th. Following this, they convened a board meeting and a general meeting of members to summarize the spring planting work, recognize the advantages and disadvantages, and propose improvements. This cooperative was established on the basis of relatively good material conditions, cadre conditions, and the masses' consciousness, and carried out education on socialist prospects and patriotism; members saw their future in the agricultural production cooperative and recognized it as a path to happiness, so their production enthusiasm was generally high. They issued a challenge to farmers throughout the county to launch a patriotic production increase competition, which promoted a high-yield movement throughout the county; at the same time, the responses from mutual aid groups in various districts of the county greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of the members of this cooperative. During the spring planting, they carried out many technical reforms. Soybean seeds were mixed with rhizobia when sown; millet and sorghum seeds were winnowed twice and disinfected with Wang Copper; corn and soybean seeds were all selected by grain; and all seeds were tested for germination, with germination rates generally above 92%. Breaking down land boundaries and unified cultivation not only increased the cultivated area but also began to implement reasonable crop rotation. Because sowing was carried out in a unified and planned manner, planting upland first and then lowland after rain, the seedlings grew very well. Labor efficiency also increased compared to before the establishment of the cooperative, saving twenty-eight man-days and thirty-eight horse-days during the spring planting phase. After summarizing the achievements of this stage, they further recognized the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. However, because this cooperative was established not long ago, some problems also arose during the spring planting: (1) The problem of horse usage: When each household contributed horses as shares, they were assessed "points" according to the strength of the horses, and the cooperative used them in a unified manner, changing the previous method of calculating work by the day. However, because the horse sheds had not yet been built, they were still raised separately. This cooperative has a large number of horses, and sometimes they could not all be used. Therefore, some members were still wary, always afraid that their horses would do too much work and get tired. As a result, horses could not be used very rationally, and sometimes the land was not plowed well enough. Because they were raised separately, it took a lot of time to hitch the plows, with one person bringing a horse at one moment and another person bringing a horse at another moment, not arriving together. Their solution was to temporarily continue to raise the horses separately, and allocate and use them in a unified and rational manner, before the horse sheds were built. Each horse was given ten rest tickets, and one ticket was handed in for each day of rest, taking turns to rest. When everyone had used up their rest tickets, they would be reissued. Households with two or three horses were not allowed to substitute weak horses for strong horses. Members could use horses at home for odd jobs, provided that it did not affect production within the cooperative. (2) The problem of people taking time off: When the cooperative was first established, there were very few cases of missed work, and some people were unwilling to rest even when they were sick. Later, one member felt a little tired and took five consecutive days off (the cooperative stipulates that sick leave of up to five days is counted as half a work unit, and only leave of more than five days is not counted), and some members who were not highly conscious felt that this was "worthwhile," and would take time off if they felt slightly unwell. Most members were very dissatisfied with this. After this discussion, it was decided that each person could have 150 "points" of vacation per year (calculated by "points" rather than by days, in order to avoid differences between busy and slack work; generally, one work day is counted as ten "points"), and missed work within 150 "points" would not be counted as missed work; missed work exceeding 150 "points" would result in a deduction of grain according to the work unit (except for those who missed work due to official duties); those who did not reach 150 "points" would be given grain as a reward after autumn according to the "points." Those who were truly suffering from serious illnesses that required them to be bedridden could be given appropriate care by the cooperative. (3) The problem of women participating in labor: Initially, women did not join the cooperative and were paid wages on a daily basis for their work. As a result, they were not very motivated to work. Later, this practice was corrected, and women were admitted to the cooperative. Women's labor in the cooperative was implemented through a "contract system," in which tasks were combined into "work units" according to the intensity of male labor, and contracted to women; women were then assessed "points" and counted as "work units" according to each person's labor capacity, and grain was distributed in the same way as the "work units" done by male laborers after autumn. However, some women had new ideological concerns after joining the cooperative, thinking that joining the cooperative was not as good as taking wages on a daily basis, they could not "receive benefits immediately" (receive wages for the work they did every day), and they were afraid that the grain they distributed after the fall would belong to the whole family, and they would not have a "small share." As a result, only a few women went to the fields every day. After this discussion, it was tentatively stipulated that the grain earned by women's labor would be paid directly to the women themselves by the cooperative, and the family could not interfere (unless the woman herself agreed to give it to the whole family). If the women did not want grain, they would be paid in cash at market prices. (4) The problem of using agricultural tools: Because the cooperative was busy with spring plowing after its establishment, the members' agricultural tools were not evaluated in time, so some people were not very careful when using them, and did not repair them when they were broken. After discussion, it was decided that large agricultural tools would be evaluated immediately and sold to the cooperative as collective property; the money would be repaid with a two-cent interest after autumn. Small agricultural tools that each household needed to use frequently would not be priced for the time being, but would be lent to the cooperative for use, and the cooperative would compensate for any damage; after the cooperative purchased them uniformly after autumn, they would be returned to the original owners. All agricultural tools would be kept in the custody of the administrator to avoid loss. (5) The problem of rewards and punishments: There was a top-heavy phenomenon in the cooperative, with the leaders of the cooperative being extremely busy every day, while some members were slow to move, and would not act unless the cadres spoke, and would not actively exert their strength. After this discussion, it was stipulated that a democratic evaluation would be carried out at each monthly meeting of members, according to each person's work attitude, work effect, and love of public property, unity of the masses, and learning. Those who were good would be given verbal praise or an increase in work points as a reward, and those who were bad would be given criticism or a reduction in work points as a punishment. (Editor's note: The method of using an increase or decrease in work points as a reward or punishment is not good, and other appropriate methods should be used for rewards or punishments.) In addition, this inspection found that the requirements for studying culture and sanitation in the plans made in the past were too high and unrealistic; after discussion, they were revised to make them practical and easy to implement. After this inspection and summary, the awareness of all members was raised a step further, and they were all satisfied with the improvement measures. After further discussion, everyone formulated a summer production plan, determined to create greater achievements in the patriotic production increase movement.

    王云廷农业生产合作社
    总结春季生产工作及时解决社内问题
    黑龙江省大赉县王云廷农业生产合作社，到五月十五日已把七十二垧大田全部播种完毕。接着，他们召开理事会和社员大会，作了春耕播种工作的总结，认识了优点和缺点，提出了改进的办法。这个合作社是在较好的物质条件、干部条件和群众自觉的基础上成立起来的，成立后并进行了社会主义远景和爱国主义的教育；社员们从农业生产合作社看到了自己的明天，认识了这是一条通往幸福的道路，所以生产劲头一般是高涨的。他们向全县农民提出了开展爱国增产竞赛的挑战，推动了全县的丰产运动；同时，全县各区互助组的应战书，也大大鼓舞了这个合作社的社员们的生产热情。在春耕播种中，他们进行了许多技术改革。大豆播种时拌了根瘤菌；谷子、高粱种籽风选两遍，并用王铜消了毒；玉米、大豆种籽都实行粒选；全部种籽都作了发芽试验，发芽率一般都在百分之九十二以上。土地打破地界，统一耕作，不但增加了耕地面积，而且开始实行合理的轮作（即“调茬”）。因为统一地有计划地进行播种，雨后先种岗地后种洼地，所以小苗长得都很好。劳动效率也比没有成立合作社时提高了，在春耕播种阶段，节省了二十八个人工和三十八个马工。他们总结了这一阶段的成绩后，进一步认识了农业生产合作社的好处。但因为这个合作社成立还不久，在春耕播种中也发生了一些问题：（一）马匹的使用问题：各户以马入股时，都按马的力量的强弱评了“分”，由社里统一使用，改变了过去按日计工的方式。但是，因为马棚还没盖好，还是分散饲养。他们这个社的马匹较多，有时不能全用上。因此，有的社员仍然揣着小心眼，总怕自己的马多做活，把马累坏了。这样，马匹就还不能很合理地使用，有时耕地也耕得不够好。因为是分散饲养的，套犁时一会儿你牵来一匹，一会儿他牵来一匹，来得不齐，耽误不少时间。他们商量解决的办法是：在马棚没有建设好以前，马匹暂仍分散饲养，统一合理调配使用。每匹马给十张歇工票，歇一天交一张，轮流休息。大家的歇工票都用完时，再重新发给。一家有两三匹马的，不准用弱马顶替强马。社员自己家里用马干零活，以不影响社内生产为原则。（二）人歇工问题：合作社刚成立时，误工现象很少，有人生了病也不肯休息。后来有一个社员觉得累了点，一连歇工五天（社内规定病假歇工五天以内可算半个工，五天以外才不算工），有些觉悟不高的社员就觉得这样“合算”，稍感身体不舒服就要歇工。多数社员对这很不满意。经过这次讨论，决定每人每年可有一百五十“分”休假（按“分”计而不按天计，为的是免去工作忙闲的差别；一般情况下是以一个劳动日算十“分”），误工在一百五十“分”以内不算误工；超过一百五十“分”时按工扣粮（因公误工者例外）；不足一百五十“分”的，秋后按“分”给粮作为奖励。确实害有卧床不起的大病的，社里可给予适当照顾。（三）妇女参加劳动问题：最初，妇女都没有入社，做活是按日计工，给工资。因此，她们的劳动积极性不大。后来纠正了这个做法，吸收妇女入社。妇女在社内劳动实行“包做制”，办法是：按男劳动力强度把活计合成“工”数，包给妇女；妇女再按每个人的劳动能力评“分”计“工”，到秋后按“工”计算，和男劳动力做的“工”同样分粮。但是，有的妇女入社后又产生了新的思想顾虑，认为入社不如按日拿工资好，不能“现接利”（每天做了工就拿到工资），而且怕秋后算帐时自己分的粮食归全家伙有，自己没有了“小份子”。因此，每天只有很少几个妇女下地。经过这次讨论，暂规定：妇女劳动所得的粮食，合作社直接付给妇女本人，家庭不能干涉
    （经妇女本人同意归全家伙有的例外）。如果妇女不愿要粮，就按市价折合成钱付给。（四）农具使用问题，因为合作社成立后就忙于春耕，社员的农具没有及时评价，因此有些人使用时不太经心，坏了也不收拾。经讨论后决定：大农具立即评价卖给合作社作为公有财产；钱到秋后加二分利偿还。小农具是各户经常要用的，暂不作价，借给合作社使用，坏了由合作社赔偿；到秋后合作社统一购买后，再归还原主。一切农具，都由管理员负责保管，以免散失。（五）奖惩问题：社内有头重脚轻的现象，社的负责人每天忙得不可开交，而有些社员却是推推动动，干部不说话就不动弹，不积极主动地发挥力量。经这次讨论后规定：每月开社员大会时，要按每人的劳动态度、劳动效果和爱护公物、团结群众、学习等方面的情形，进行一次民主评比。好的给以口头表扬或增加工分作为奖励，坏的给以批评或减少工分作为处罚。（编者按：用增加或减少工分作为奖励或处罚的办法不好，应用其他适当办法进行奖励或处罚。）此外，这次检查中发现过去订的计划中学习文化和卫生工作的要求过高，不切实际；经讨论后加以修订，使之切实易行。经过这次检查总结，全体社员的觉悟提高了一步，对于改进的办法也都感到满意。大家又经过讨论订出了夏季生产计划，决心在爱国丰产运动中创造更大的成绩。
