　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: Of the three children wounded by the U.S. shelling of the Panmunjom meeting area on the 5th, one is seriously injured and in danger of losing his life. In addition to the five peaceful residents killed on the edge of the meeting area, two women and two children are also seriously injured. This is another illustration of the "humanitarian principles" that the U.S. aggressors proclaim daily in Panmunjom.
　　Regarding this serious provocative incident, the U.S. side, as in the past when the negotiation situation was tense, adopted the old methods of news blockade and complete distortion of the facts. After the incident on the 5th, the security officers of both sides went to the scene to investigate. They did not leave the meeting area, and the U.S. security officers had to admit that their shells did hit the meeting area. However, the U.S. side later told their reporters that the security officers investigated in an area one thousand yards away from the meeting area. But the bloody facts cannot be blocked.
　　The reporter visited the injured at the Kaesong City People's Hospital on the 6th. Twelve-year-old Cui Songyu, whose ribs were pierced by shrapnel, lay dying in her mother's arms. The other two girls who were injured in the meeting area, one with shrapnel penetrating her right lower leg and the other with a head laceration from shrapnel. They were playing together when the U.S. shells suddenly came on the morning of the 5th.
　　A nursing infant with a leg injury had one of his small legs amputated to save his life. More unfortunately, the child's mother and a two-year-old brother have been killed. There are also two other seriously injured women and children in the hospital. The husband of one of the women said, "We just finished transplanting the rice seedlings on the 4th, all thanks to the government's help. The government is so good to us. But on the 5th, U.S. shells injured my wife and one of my children. These American robbers just don't want us to live!"
　　The atrocities of American generals murdering women and children have already happened twice even in the Panmunjom area, which both sides clearly agreed would be immune from all attacks. On October 12th of last year, U.S. planes strafed a group of children near Panmunjom, killing a boy on the spot and wounding his younger brother. Ridgway had to admit full responsibility for this brutal event afterward. In order to wash his bloody hands, he also issued a statement saying that he was "heartbroken" and that "United Nations forces will continue to avoid loss of life and property of non-combatant people." But the events of June 5th gave the American generals another resounding slap in the face.

### 板门店受伤居民伤势严重  美方所谓“人道原则”真相毕露

    板门店受伤居民伤势严重
    美方所谓“人道原则”真相毕露
    【新华社开城七日电】五日美方炮击板门店会场区杀伤的三名儿童，其中一人伤势严重，性命危险。在会场区边缘被杀伤的和平居民，除五人已死外，两个妇女、两个儿童的伤势也很严重。这是美国侵略者天天在板门店叫嚣的“人道原则”的又一个说明。
    对这一严重挑衅事件，美方正如在过去谈判局势紧张时一样，采取了新闻封锁、完全歪曲事实的老办法。五日事件之后，双方安全军官曾到现场调查，他们未离开会场区一步，而且美方安全军官曾不得不承认他们的炮弹确是打进会场区。但事后美方却告诉他们的记者说，安全军官在会场区一千码外的地区调查。但血的事实是封锁不了的。
    记者六日往开城市人民医院访问伤者。碎片贯入肋骨的十二岁小孩崔松玉，躺在母亲怀中，奄奄一息。在会场区受伤的另外两个女孩，一个碎片贯入右下腿，一个头部被碎片裂伤。她们在五日晨美国炮弹突然飞来的时候，正在一起游戏。
    一个腿部受伤的乳婴，为要保全生命，已被锯去一只小腿。更不幸的是这孩子的母亲和一个两岁的哥哥已被打死了。医院中另外还有两个受重伤的妇女及小孩。其中一个妇女的丈夫说：“四日我们才插完了秧，全是靠政府帮助的哪，政府对我们太好了。但五日美国炮弹却打伤了我的妻子与一个孩子。这些美国强盗就是不让我们活下去！”
    美国将军们屠杀妇女儿童的暴行，即使在双方明白协议免受一切攻击的板门店地区，也已经发生了两次。去年十月十二日，美国飞机曾对板门店附近的一群儿童扫射，当场打死一个男孩并打伤他的幼弟。事后李奇微不得不承认这一残酷事件的全部责任。为了洗刷他血腥的双手，他还发表了一个声明，说什么他“衷心悲痛”，又说什么“联合国军将继续避免非战斗人民的生命财产损失”。但六月五日的事件又打了美国将军们一记响亮的耳光。
