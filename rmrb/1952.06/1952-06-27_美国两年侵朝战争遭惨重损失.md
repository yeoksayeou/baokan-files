Xinhua News Agency, June 26th - The Korean War has entered its third year. In the past two years, American aggressors have suffered a historically significant and devastating defeat. The American invading forces have been driven back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the very place from which they launched their aggression, and are powerless to advance further. More importantly, the two years of the Korean War have substantially tied down and depleted the forces that the United States originally intended to use to invade the entire world, severely disrupting the U.S.'s war preparations deployment worldwide.

The current Korean front is only a little over 150 miles long. Compared to the aggressive line of 25,000 miles that the United States delusionally planned to use to encircle the Soviet Union, China, and all People's Democratic countries, it only accounts for one-one hundred and sixty-sixth of it. However, this "small war" on such a short front has absorbed the main force of the U.S. military and is consuming U.S. manpower and materials at an alarming rate. According to a Tokyo dispatch published in the May 30th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the United States has "trained troops tied down on the Korean battlefield" of about 450,000. In addition, there are millions of people in the United States engaged in logistics and training services. According to the U.S. Department of Defense's figures, which are obviously greatly reduced, the casualties of the U.S. invading forces in the Korean War have exceeded 109,000. Added to this are the more than 401,000 "non-combat casualties" of the U.S. military announced by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lovett as of January 1st of this year. The number of casualties admitted by the U.S. government has reached more than 510,000. In terms of money and war materials, the aforementioned "U.S. News & World Report" magazine Tokyo dispatch estimates, based on the current rate of U.S. consumption in the Korean War, that the U.S. will have a "minimum consumption" of: $7.5 billion in war expenses, the loss or damage of about 1,000 aircraft, 3.5 million barrels of gasoline and oil, and 7 million tons of guns, ammunition, and military supplies. One of the U.S. military leaders, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, admitted in a radio speech last September:

"The Korean War is the most costly and bloodiest war the United States has ever fought."

The Korean War exposed the fact that the United States, an outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger. The United States, which boasts of being the "world's number one power," is currently showing signs of strain in all aspects under the huge consumption of this "small war." In terms of military strength, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins revealed in a report to the Congressional Military Subcommittee on May 2nd: "The United States (domestically) does not currently have a single active division that can replace or reinforce the troops in Korea." U.S. Air Force Secretary Finletter admitted on April 1st and May 27th that the Korean War has weakened the U.S. Air Force, and the Air Force Department has been forced to divert its aircraft to Korea, resulting in the major tasks that the U.S. Air Force must do being somewhat disrupted. The domestic source of troops in the United States has dried up, and it has encountered great difficulties in recruiting army and air force personnel, and it has been unable to complete its original goals." Finletter also said while testifying to Congress on April 16th: the Air Force originally wanted to recruit a large number of qualified personnel to train flight personnel, but now it is "at a loss" and cannot recruit enough numbers, and the Air Force reserve manpower has been "gradually exhausted." In terms of military supplies, Agence France-Presse Washington reported on June 17th that U.S. Army Secretary Pace said in a closed-door meeting of a Senate subcommittee that the war materials consumed by U.S. troops in Korea are experiencing a phenomenon of being too late to replenish, and the U.S.'s reserves of war materials are less than they were at the beginning of the Korean War. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins also testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 5th: some very important munitions have been allocated, and the inventory from World War II is almost used up.

The result of such a large consumption of U.S. power has seriously affected the U.S.'s war preparation plans in other parts of the world, especially in Western Europe. Due to the restraint of the Korean War, the United States has been unable to equip the invading forces it wants to establish in Western Europe, and it is unable to establish a so-called "substantial situation" for launching a world war in Western Europe. According to U.S. Republican Senator Lodge in early October of last year, Western Europe received only one-fifth of the weapons and equipment that the U.S. government promised to provide. Former Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic invasion forces, Eisenhower, admitted in his North Atlantic invasion group work report released this April: "Due to the prolongation of the Korean War... the strength of Western countries has been greatly depleted, causing Western countries to lose the power to establish a substantial situation in Europe." Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley also admitted: "Since U.S. troops were handed over to the United Nations to fight in Korea, the United States has not had enough surplus forces to deal with an enemy in any other specific location."

People can see that the American aggressors have spent a vast amount of manpower and material resources in the two years of the Korean War. All they have gained is a defeat. The significance of this fact in the American aggressors' so-called "global strategy" can be seen from former Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Army and current Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower's assessment of the Korean War. Eisenhower said one month after the outbreak of the Korean War: "If we cannot win this war, then we will not win anywhere." Two years later, Eisenhower has had to admit that the United States has failed in the Korean War. He publicly stated on June 5th: he "has no way to end the Korean War victoriously. ... I do not believe that our troops in Korea can carry things through to the end." Now, the whole world will draw a conclusion from the U.S.'s defeat in Korea: since the American aggressors have failed in the Korean War, they will also fail in any war they dare to launch.

### 美国两年侵朝战争遭惨重损失

    美国两年侵朝战争遭惨重损失
    【新华社二十六日讯】朝鲜战争已经进入第三个年头。两年来美国侵略者已遭到了具有历史意义的惨重失败。美国侵略军已经被赶回到它原来发动侵略的地点——三八线附近，无力再进。而且，更为重要的是，两年的朝鲜战争已经大量牵制并消耗了美国原来准备用来侵略全世界的力量，严重地打乱了美国在全世界的备战部署。
    朝鲜目前战线不过一百五十多哩，按照美国妄想包围苏联、中国和各人民民主国家全部二万五千哩边境的侵略线比较起来，只占其一百六十六分之一。但是，就在这样短短的战线上进行的“小战争”，却吸住了美国的军事主力，以惊人的规模消耗着美国的人力和物资。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志五月三十日刊载的一篇东京通讯透露：美国“拖在朝鲜战场上的有训练的兵力”约有四十五万人，此外在美国从事后勤和训练等勤务的还有数百万人。照美国国防部公布的显然大大缩小了的“战斗伤亡”数字，美国侵略军在朝鲜战争中的伤亡已超过十万九千人；再加上美国国防部长罗维特宣布的到今年一月一日为止美军“非战斗伤亡”四十万一千余人，美国官方所承认的伤亡人数就已达五十一万余人。在金钱及战争物资方面，上述“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志东京通讯按照美国目前在朝鲜战争中的消耗率，估计美国每年“最低消耗量”将为：战争费用七十五亿美元，飞机损失或损毁约一千架，汽油及机油三百五十万桶，枪械、弹药及军需品七百万吨。美国军事首脑人物之一，参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷在去年九月发表的广播演说中承认：
    “朝鲜战争是美国所进行的一次代价最大、流血最多的战争。”
    朝鲜战争使美国这个外强中干的纸老虎原形毕露。自吹为“世界头号强国”的美国，在这个“小战争”的巨大消耗下，目前各方面却显出了捉襟见肘的窘态。在兵力方面，美国陆军参谋长柯林斯五月二日在国会军事小组委员会上报告中透露：“美国（国内）现在根本没有一个现役师可以替代或增援朝鲜的军队。”美国空军部长芬立脱在四月一日及五月二十七日承认：朝鲜战争使得美国空军力量减弱，空军部被迫把它的飞机挪用于朝鲜，结果使美国空军所必须做的主要任务已多少被打乱了。美国国内兵源枯竭，在征募陆军及空军人员上遭到很大困难，无法完成原定目标。”芬立脱在四月十六日于国会作证时还说：空军本来要招募大批合格人员来训练飞行人员，但是现在“一筹莫展”，招募不到足够的数目，空军后备人力已“渐渐耗竭殆尽”。在军事物资方面，法新社华盛顿六月十七日电透露，美国陆军部长佩斯曾在参院某小组委员会秘密会议上说：美国部队在朝鲜消耗的战争物资已有来不及补充的现象，美国战争物资的储备已比朝鲜战争初起时少了。美国陆军参谋长柯林斯也曾在五月五日于参院拨款委员会作证时说：某些很重要的军火已拨用了，第二次世界大战时的存货差不多要用光了。
    美国的力量如此大量消耗的结果，已使美国在世界其他地方，特别是在西欧的备战计划受到严重的影响。美国由于朝鲜战争的牵制，已经无力装备它要在西欧成立的侵略军，无力在西欧建立发动世界战争的所谓“有实力的局面”。据美国共和党参议员洛奇在去年十月初透露，西欧得到的武器和装备，只有美国政府答应给予的五分之一。前北大西洋侵略军总司令艾森豪威尔在他今年四月所发表的北大西洋侵略集团工作报告中承认：“由于朝鲜战争……的延长，……西方国家的实力已经大为枯竭，使西方国家损失了在欧洲建立有实力的局面的力量。”美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷也承认：“自从美国的部队交给联合国在朝鲜作战后，美国就没有足够的多余的兵力可以在任何其他特定地点对付一个敌人了。”
    人们可以看到，美国侵略者在两年的朝鲜战争中，花了浩大的人力与物力。所得到的只是一个失败。这个事实在美国侵略者的所谓“全球战略”中的意义可以从前北大西洋军总司令、现在的共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔对朝鲜战争的估价中得到证明。艾森豪威尔在朝鲜战争爆发一个月之后曾说过：“如果我们赢不了这次战争，那么我们在任何地方也不会打赢的。”两年以后，艾森豪威尔已经不得不承认美国在朝鲜战争中是失败了。他在六月五日公开表示：他“没有任何办法使朝鲜战争胜利结束。……我不相信我们在朝鲜的军队能够把事情贯彻到底。”现在，全世界都将从美国在朝鲜的败局中得出一个结论，美国侵略者既然已在朝鲜战争中失败，他们也将在他们胆敢发动的任何战争中失败。
