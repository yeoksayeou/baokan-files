    A Worker's Opinion on Literary and Art Workers
    Cheng Yunxiong, Worker of Shenxin No. 6 Factory
    How can writers and workers, peasants and soldiers unite, and unite well? This question should be concluded in this Shanghai literary and art circle rectification movement. I think: Comrades in literary and art circles should take this issue as a major part of the rectification movement and ideological remolding; otherwise, even if you chant or think all day long, "Listen to Chairman Mao, literature and art should serve workers, peasants and soldiers," how can you be considered to have listened to Chairman Mao, and how can literature and art serve workers, peasants and soldiers? If this issue is not further clarified, it will be difficult for writers to unite well with workers, peasants and soldiers.
    The working class in Shanghai has always been unfamiliar with the writers. Because before liberation, most of the Shanghai writers wrote works for the petty bourgeoisie to read; during the reactionary rule, although some writers wanted to write works that portrayed the working class and were for the working class, and they did write some, they did not write well because they were not familiar with the workers. Later, some writers followed the Communist Party and entered the countryside and the army, and a long period of revolutionary struggle enabled these writers to initially unite with the peasants and the People's Liberation Army; however, the working class and the Shanghai writers only began to become familiar with each other after liberation. Due to mutual misunderstanding, it is difficult to ask writers to write works that portray the workers all at once; however, writers should not overemphasize the difficulties, and should work hard subjectively. Are there any difficulties that cannot be overcome? Mr. Lao She said it well: "I will start all over again from elementary school and be a primary school student." He learned to write from eight or ten sentences, and slowly wrote some short plays. His "Dragon Beard Ditch" is a successful work. Mr. Lao She's achievements are inseparable from his subjective efforts. He loves the motherland, loves labor, and loves the working people. He has initially understood the thoughts and feelings of the working people. He is not just paying lip service.
    Therefore, if writers want to write works that portray the workers, they must first make themselves love the workers, love labor, understand the greatness of labor, and connect their lives with the workers and labor; use the method of thinking and comparing: think about what your clothing, food, and housing would be like without laborers? Compare your life with that of the laborers. Since liberation, how much contribution have you made to the vast people of New China? This can correct the writers' arrogant and detached from the masses thinking style, and from the love of workers and labor, further understand and appreciate the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the laborers. For example, some writers go to factories to learn from the working class, but as a result, they learn very little after five or six months. Because there is still a big gap between writers and workers, they say they are going to the factory to learn, but they do not really love the workers and labor. They always use their own set of ideas to understand the lives of the working class, and as a result, they naturally learn nothing.
    What we workers care most about is labor and production, and we are particularly happy about the development of production in New China. We protect the production machines and finished products, whether they are small nails or large wheels, as if we were protecting our own children or eyes. If writers do not understand this, if they do not truly love labor and production, it is a fantasy to try to unite with the working class. Writers must resolutely abandon their petty-bourgeois ideas and learn humbly in labor and production in order to truly establish the thoughts and feelings of the working class. If you love labor and can talk to workers about labor and production issues, workers will definitely become very close to you.
    In this rectification movement, the literary and art circles, through work inspection and ideological self-criticism, should also consider: how to go to the factory to learn from practice? Where to learn from? After learning, how to serve the working class? How to serve well? How to help the working class master the weapon of literature and art themselves? Regarding these issues, comrades in literary and art circles should carry out their work in the same way as workers, peasants and soldiers formulate production plans and combat plans. The working class across the country has now launched a patriotic production competition; comrades in literary and art circles should launch your competition on the literary and art front! Let us encourage each other in different positions and strive together for the upcoming high tide of economic construction and cultural construction in New China.

    一个工人对文艺工作者的意见
    申新六厂工人　成云雄
    作家和工农兵怎样才能结合，并且结合得很好。关于这问题，在这次上海文艺界整风运动中，是应该得出结论的。我想：文艺界的同志，应该把这一问题作为整风运动、思想改造中的主要的一部分，否则，虽然你嘴里整天地唤着或想着：“要听毛主席的话，文艺面向工农兵。”但是怎样才算是听了毛主席的话，怎样又才是文艺面向工农兵呢？如果不进一步地把这问题搞清楚，作家们是很难与工农兵结合得好的。
    上海的工人阶级与作家一直是互相不很了解不很熟悉的。因为在解放前上海的作家，大部分都是写些给小资产阶级看的作品；在反动派统治的时候，虽然有些作家也想写表现工人阶级和给工人阶级看的作品，而且也写了一些，但是因为不熟悉工人，所以写得并不好。后来有些作家跟着共产党，进入了农村、部队，长时期的革命斗争生活，使这些作家与农民、解放军已初步地结合起来；但是工人阶级和上海的作家们却是在解放后才开始熟悉起来的。由于相互不了解，要求作家一下子写表现工人的作品，是有一定困难的；不过作家们不该太强调困难，应该从主观上努力起来。难道会有克服不了的困难吗？老舍先生说得好：“我重新再从小学读起，做一个小学生。”他从十句八句学写，慢慢地写些短剧，他写的“龙须沟”，是一个成功的作品。老舍先生的成绩和他的主观努力是分不开的，他热爱祖国，热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民。他初步地体会了劳动人民的思想和感情，他不是光在嘴上说些空话的。
    所以，作家们要想写表现工人的作品，首先要使自己热爱工人，热爱劳动，懂得劳动的伟大，把自己的生活与工人、劳动联系起来；用想一想比一比的办法：想一想，如果没有劳动者，自己的衣、食、住，将会变成什么样子？比一比，自己与劳动者的生活是如何？解放以来，自己对新中国广大人民的贡献有多少？这样就能纠正作家们自高自大、脱离群众的思想作风，从热爱工人与劳动中，更进
    一步地去了解体味劳动者的生活、思想、感情。比如：有些作家下厂向工人阶级学习，结果学了五六个月，学到的东西却很少。因为作家与工人还是有很大的距离，他们口头上说是下厂学习，其实对工人和劳动并不热爱，他们总以自己的一套，来体会工人阶级的生活，结果自然学不到东西。
    我们工人最关心的是劳动和生产，我们对新中国的生产的发展，特别感到高兴。生产的机器、成品，不管是小的钉子，或大的轮盘，我们都像爱护自己的儿女或眼睛一样地保护着。如果作家们不了解这一点，如果并不真正热爱劳动和生产，想去与工人阶级结合，这是空想。作家们一定要坚决放弃自己小资产阶级的一套想法，虚心地在劳动和生产中学习，才能真正确立起工人阶级的思想和情感，假使你热爱劳动，能与工人谈些劳动生产的问题，工人一定会与你搞得很亲热的。
    文艺界在这次整风运动中，通过工作检查和思想检讨，还应该考虑：怎样下厂向实际学习？从什么地方去学？学了以后，又怎样去为工人阶级服务？怎样才能服务得好？怎样帮助工人阶级自己掌握文艺这一武器？关于这些问题，文艺界的同志们，应该要像工农兵订生产计划、作战计划等一样的来进行工作。全国的工人阶级目前已展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛；文艺界的同志们，应该在文艺战线上，展开你们的竞赛！我们在不同的岗位上，相互鼓励，为着新中国即将到来的经济建设的高潮、文化建设的高潮共同奋斗吧。
