    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 2nd: The "Humanité Dimanche" published a statement by General Mayèle-Roinville, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, regarding the police search of the Communist Party Central Committee headquarters on May 31st.

    General Mayèle-Roinville said: "The police violently forced open the doors of the Central Committee offices. The office staff present pointed out that, according to the law, the police must wait for a member of the Central Committee to be present before negotiating the search. However, the police ignored this suggestion and forcibly opened many drawers, which, of course, contained only documents related to the Party's activities, and they found nothing else.

    "This matter is a clear violation of the law. When I negotiated with the police officer in charge of this 'operation,' he replied that he was not present during the search. None of the other police officers present could produce a search warrant."

    General Mayèle-Roinville continued, pointing out that the search was conducted twice: the first time was in the presence of the Central Committee staff, and the police officers said they found nothing; the second time was when the staff was not present, they took the staff to another room and had armed police guard them. In this situation, the police "found some documents."

    General Mayèle-Roinville said: "Clearly, this 'operation' was carefully planned in advance, a real conspiracy, intended to frame our Party - unwavering defenders of peace."

    法共中委马耶莱—儒恩维尔发表声明
    抗议警察非法搜查法共中央总部
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社巴黎二日讯：“人道报星期日刊”登载了法国共产党中央委员马耶莱—儒恩维尔将军就警察于五月三十一日搜查共产党中央委员会总部一事发表的声明。
    马耶莱—儒恩维尔将军说：“警察以暴力打开中央委员会办公室的门。当时在场的办公室人员指出，根据法律，警察必须等到有一名中央委员到场，才能交涉搜查。但是，警察没有理睬这意见，强行打开了许多抽屉，当然那里面尽是一些关于党的活动的文件，别的什么他们也没有搜查出来。
    “这件事情显然是违反法律的，当我向负责这个‘行动’的警官交涉时，他回答说搜查的时候他没有在场。当时在场的其他警官也没有一个人能拿得出搜查签票。”
    马耶莱—儒恩维尔将军接着指出，搜查进行过两次：第一次是当着中央委员会工作人员的面进行的，这一次警官们说他们没有搜查出什么来；第二次是工作人员不在场的时候进行的，他们把工作人员带到另外一个房间里，派武装警察看守着。在这种情况下，警察便“搜出了一些文件”。
    马耶莱—儒恩维尔将军说：“显然，这次‘行动’是事先布置妥当的，是一个真正的阴谋，用意在于陷害我们的党——坚持不渝的和平保卫者。”
