Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 22nd: TASS reported that Soviet Representative Malik made the following statement at the Security Council meeting on June 20th: "The Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet government, has proposed a resolution: that the Security Council call upon all countries to participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons in order to promote peace and international security; and to disseminate the provisions of the Geneva Protocol more widely internationally; to encourage countries that have not yet participated in or ratified this protocol to participate in or ratify this protocol, and to bear the serious political obligations, international legal obligations, and moral obligations stipulated in the terms of the Geneva Protocol. This is the purpose of the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and the Soviet delegation attending the Security Council."

Next, Malik summarized the discussion on the Soviet proposal.

Malik said: "First, we must point out that the representatives of all countries that have ratified the Geneva Protocol have reaffirmed that their countries continue to abide by this protocol. None of these delegations and their governments has said anything detrimental to this protocol. They, including the British delegation, have expressed due respect for it, saying that their countries will continue to abide by it.

Therefore, on this issue, no country is following the United States. In their speeches, no representative used the same words as the US President regarding the Geneva Protocol, namely the so-called 'outdated' statement. This is the most important result of today's debate.

US Representative Gross tried his best to make his colleagues' speeches today favorable to him, but it was all in vain. The speeches had very few favorable points towards the US delegation's attitude, and quite a few unfavorable ones. The representatives of those countries that had ratified the Geneva Protocol unanimously said that they still respect this protocol, but they only went that far. The position of their governments in the North Atlantic military aggression alliance created by the United States made them afraid to say 'B' after saying 'A'. They reaffirmed their respect for the protocol and reaffirmed their obligations, but after that they could not go further, and dared not openly state that this protocol obliges them to take all measures to ensure that other countries participate in and ratify this protocol. The aforementioned delegations did not mention this point.

This situation cannot be ignored. However, no delegation reiterated what the US President said about the Geneva Protocol, which proves that the United States is isolated on this issue. Since such an international agreement that is binding on the conscience and behavior of countries has been ratified by forty-two countries and has become an important principle of international law, no one has the right to ignore it, not even the US President or the US representative to the Security Council.

Therefore, the US government dares to say that the Geneva Protocol is 'outdated', and it has taken on too much responsibility. It is contempt for the people of the world and international law, contempt for the countries and people who have participated in and ratified this protocol. Due to their participation and ratification, this protocol has become an important and serious principle of international law, placing serious, responsible political obligations, international legal obligations, and moral obligations on countries and nations.

This is the basic conclusion and result of today's debate.

The US representative put forward the so-called 'difference' between 1952 and 1925, attempting to use this as an excuse to refuse to ratify the protocol. Mr. Gross, for more than twenty years, the US government's attitude towards this protocol has not changed. If we look at the official documents—the records of the US Senate—we can know that twenty-six years ago, on December 9, 1926, the US Senate discussed the issue of ratifying the Geneva Protocol. But what were the three main arguments against ratifying the protocol at that time?

First, chemical weapons are the cheapest to manufacture and the most effective to use in war.

This is the first theory. Is it not precisely this theory that is mainly influencing the attitude of the US government in 1952, twenty-six years later, today? It is precisely this theory.

The US Army and Navy generals, politicians, and congressmen shamelessly say that weapons of mass destruction, including bacteriological and chemical weapons, are cheaper and more effective, and that they can be used to kill more people at a lower cost.

The second theory is distrust and suspicion of other countries and other nations.

At the Senate meeting at that time, someone quoted a passage from the then American military authority, the late General John Pershing. General Pershing's words were like this. Senator Fletcher asked him: In other words, can we say for sure that the use of poison gas is an inhumane thing and cannot be allowed to be used again in the future? General Pershing replied: No, of course not, because we cannot trust the other party. The reason why they opposed the prohibition of chemical weapons was because they did not trust the other 'party', that is, they did not trust other countries. This was the situation twenty-six years ago.

So, how do the US ruling circles explain their unwillingness to ratify this protocol now?

Anyone can find the answer to this question from Gross's speech at the last meeting. They say they don't trust the Soviet Union, so, you see, they don't ratify the Geneva Protocol. This kind of argument is only laughable. The essence of the problem remains the same as it was twenty-six years ago. The US ruling circles did not trust other countries and peoples twenty-six years ago, and they still do not trust other countries and peoples now. Therefore, they are preparing to use weapons of mass destruction against these countries. This is their second argument, and the situation twenty-six years ago is no different from today's situation.

The third argument. We can see from the official records of the Senate: Senator Borah, who was in favor of ratifying the Geneva Protocol, quoted a large passage from the 'Washington Post', which said: The most active opponents of ratifying the Geneva Protocol are the well-known reactionary 'American Legion' and other military groups. Supporting these groups are also many American chemical companies, who are afraid that after the United States ratifies the Geneva Protocol, it will affect their 'business', affect their profits, and the American merchants who manufacture death will also suffer losses. The same merchants who manufacture death are now not only manufacturing chemical weapons, but also manufacturing bacteriological weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. They also oppose the prohibition of bacteriological and chemical weapons in 1952, just as they opposed the ratification of the Geneva Protocol. History is repeating itself in these places.

The above are three decisive factors that explain why the United States has not ratified the Geneva Protocol for more than twenty years, why the United States did not ratify the Geneva Protocol in 1926 and is still unwilling to ratify it now, and why the United States opposes the Soviet proposal that the Security Council should call on all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol.

As the British representative said, the Soviet Union not only ratified the Geneva Protocol, but also immediately took measures to improve this protocol. Some of the words quoted in detail by the British representative here only make my work easier.

The British representative recalled that after the Soviet government ratified the Geneva Protocol, it submitted a proposal to the organizations of the League of Nations in April 1929, requesting the addition of clauses to the Geneva Protocol stipulating that within three months after the agreement came into effect, all equipment and materials for chemical and bacteriological warfare should be destroyed; stipulating that from the date the Geneva Protocol came into effect, enterprises manufacturing materials for chemical and bacteriological warfare should cease production; and stipulating that worker control should be established in these enterprises.

I was originally going to say these words myself, but the British representative said them for me. I am very grateful to him for this.

However, he did not mention the fact that Britain and the United States prevented the adoption of the Soviet proposal. When the Soviet Union put forward this proposal to improve the Geneva Protocol, the British delegation, leading the Anglo-French group—just as the US delegation leads the US-British group today—prevented the adoption of the Soviet proposal.

This shows on the other hand that the Soviet Union is not limited to merely ratifying the Geneva Protocol. It also immediately took measures to improve the Geneva Protocol. It strictly abides by this protocol and believes that this protocol is an effective international tool for prohibiting chemical and bacteriological warfare. This was the Soviet Union's attitude twenty-six years ago. It is also its attitude today.

I can also say that after ratifying the Geneva Protocol, the Soviet Union immediately submitted a proposal to the organizations of the League of Nations, requesting that an appeal be made to all countries that had signed but not yet ratified the protocol, calling on them to ratify it as soon as possible. This proposal was adopted by the preparatory committee for convening the disarmament conference. But the United States still ignored this resolution and has not ratified the protocol to this day.

The Soviet Union put forward a similar proposal again in 1932. The United States opposed ratification as before. These are undeniable facts.

Those who oppose the Soviet proposal attempt to explain that they oppose it because they believe it is necessary to formulate a general disarmament plan, and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons will be part of this plan. Naturally, no one denies this. Since the establishment of the United Nations, for many years the Soviet Union has been making great efforts to formulate a comprehensive plan including all factors—the prohibition of atomic weapons, the prohibition of all other types of weapons of mass slaughter, including bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons and other weapons, the practical and effective reduction of armed forces and armaments—but, for reasons that everyone knows, this kind of agreement has not yet been established.

In this situation, why does the Security Council ignore an existing international agreement that is generally recognized as useful and effective? Why do some members of the Security Council avoid supporting this existing international agreement and refuse to urge all countries in the world to participate in this agreement and ratify it? Would this agreement not benefit the cause of peace before a better international agreement is concluded? There can only be one answer to this question: yes, if all countries participate in this Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons, this will be a major, practical, and effective step towards consolidating peace and international security.

However, British representative Jebb and his American partner follow in the footsteps of the United States, supporting the US intention, and advocating that the Soviet proposal be handed over to the Disarmament Committee. Jebb did not answer my question: does he think that the Security Council's appeal calling on all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol—the importance of which the British representative does not deny—would in any way hinder the United Nations Disarmament Committee from formulating a better, more perfect, including all factors of the disarmament plan—the prohibition of atomic weapons, the prohibition of all other types of weapons of mass slaughter, the reduction of armed forces and armaments, supervision, the provision by countries of full official information on armaments and the verification of such information—international agreement? The British representative avoided answering this question. He said that he could neither answer 'yes' nor 'no' to this question. However, this question is the key to the issue we are currently discussing, because the Security Council's appeal will never hinder the United Nations Disarmament Committee from continuing its work on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

On the contrary, such an appeal will promote the work of this committee. Before there is something better and newer, we must not ignore the useful old things and set them aside. Only those who are preparing for new aggression, only those who are preparing to launch another world war, only those who are preparing to use bacteriological weapons and all kinds of weapons of mass destruction will spread propaganda saying that the Geneva Protocol is 'outdated'. This kind of propaganda is hostile to all mankind and violates the minimum standards of international law."

Malik then talked about the binding force produced by the Geneva Protocol.

Malik said: "The huge binding force of the Geneva Protocol on various countries, various governments, and various nations has forced the US ruling circles to take evasive and perfunctory measures not to ratify this protocol. The reason for this has been discussed above. The essence of the discussion we are conducting today, the essence of the problem we are considering today, lies in this.

Therefore, this discussion shows that those who oppose the Soviet proposal cannot refute the strength and logic of this proposal. They cannot belittle the importance of the Geneva Protocol. Needless to say, some of them are in collusion. This can be seen from their speeches. However, if there is such a motive, this is a direct violation of the Geneva Protocol by those who have ratified this international agreement."

Malik finally said: "The Soviet delegation believes that the US proposal is bankrupt and insincere. Its purpose is to send the Soviet proposal to the Disarmament Committee and bury it there, just as many Soviet proposals that were truly for the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction were buried there, just as many Soviet proposals on the genuine reduction of armaments and armed forces were buried in this committee and previous committees.

The Soviet delegation firmly opposes this intention of the US delegation."

### 马立克在二十日安理会上的发言

    马立克在二十日安理会上的发言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：苏联代表马立克六月二十日在安全理事会会议上首先发表如下声明：“苏联代表团曾奉苏联政府之命提出一项提案：安全理事会号召各国参加及批准一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，以便促进和平与国际安全；并把日内瓦议定书的规定在国际上更广泛地传播；使尚未参加或批准这个议定书的国家参加或批准这个议定书，且负担严重的政治义务、国际法义务和日内瓦议定书条款所规定的道义上的义务。这就是苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联出席安全理事会代表团的目的。”
    接着，马立克总结了关于苏联提案的讨论。
    马立克说：“首先，我们必须指出：所有已经批准日内瓦议定书的国家的代表，都重申他们的国家继续遵守这个议定书。这些代表团和他们的政府里面，没有一个说过有损这个议定书的话。它们，包括英国代表团在内，都对它表示应有的尊重，说它们的国家将继续予以遵守。
    因此，在这个问题上，没有一个国家追随美国。各国代表在发言当中，没有一个人对日内瓦议定书用过美国总统所用的字眼，即所谓‘过时’的说法。这便是今天辩论后最重要的结果。
    美国代表葛罗斯极力设法使他的同事们今天的发言对他有利，可是完全是白费了。大家的发言对美国代表团的态度有利之处很少，而不利之处倒是不少。那些过去批准了日内瓦议定书的国家的代表一致地说，他们仍然尊重这个议定书，但是他们也仅只于此。他们本国政府在美国创设的北大西洋军事侵略联盟中的地位，使他们在说了‘甲’点之后，不敢更进一步说出‘乙’点。他们重申他们尊重这个议定书，并重申他们所承担的义务，但是之后他们就不能做到再进一步，不敢公开表示这个议定书使他们有义务采取一切措施，使其他国家参加并批准这个议定书。上述各国代表团没有说到这样
    一点。
    这种情况是不可忽视的。但是，也没有一个代表团重述美国总统对日内瓦议定书所说的话，这也就证明了美国在这问题上陷于孤立，因为这样一个对各国的良知和行为有约束性的国际协议，既然已经获得四十二个国家的批准，既然已经成了国际法的重要原则，那么谁也没有权利无视它，就是美国总统或者美国驻安全理事会代表也不能例外。
    因此，美国政府敢于说日内瓦议定书已经‘过时’，也未免使自己担负了太大的责任。它这就是蔑视全世界人民和国际法，就是蔑视参加并批准了这个议定书的国家和人民，由于它们的参加和批准这个议定书已经成了国际法的重要严肃的原则，使各国和各民族负有严重的、负责的政治义务、国际法的义务和道义的义务。
    这便是今天辩论的基本结论和结果。
    美国代表提出所谓一九五二年和一九二五年彼此间的‘不同’，妄图以此作为它拒绝批准这个议定书的口实。葛罗斯先生，二十多年以来，美国政府对这个议定书的态度毫无改变。假如我们查看一下官方文件——美国参议院的记录，我们便可以知道二十六年以前，在一九二六年十二月九日，美国参议院就讨论过批准日内瓦议定书的问题。但是当时他们反对批准议定书的三个主要论据是怎么样的呢？
    第一，化学武器制造费用最低廉，在战争中使用也最有效。
    这是第一个理论。难道在一九五二年，在二十六年后的今天，对美国政府的态度起主要影响的不正是同样这一个理论吗？恰恰正是这个理论。
    美国的陆海军将领、政客和议员们无耻地说，大规模毁灭性的武器，包括细菌武器和化学武器，成本比较低廉，效能比较大，利用这种武器就可以用较少的成本，杀死更多的人。
    第二个理论就是对其他国家和其他民族的不信任和猜疑。
    在当时的参议院会议上，有人引述了美国当时的军事权威、已故约翰·潘兴将军的一段话。潘兴将军的话是这样的。参议员佛莱彻问他：换一句话来说，我们是不是能够确实地说，使用毒气是不人道的事情，不能允许今后再有人使用呢？潘兴将军回答说：不，当然不能这样说，因为我们不能信任另外的一方。他们之所以反对禁止化学武器，是因为他们不信任另外的‘一方’，也就是说他们不信任别的国家。这是二十六年以前的情形。
    那么，美国统治集团怎样解释他们现在不愿意批准这议定书的原因呢？
    任何人都可以从葛罗斯在上次会议上的发言里发现这个问题的答案。他们说他们不信任苏联，因此，你们看，他们就不批准日内瓦议定书了。这种论据只有使人好笑而已。问题的本质依然和二十六年前的情形一样。美国的统治集团在二十六年以前就不信任其他的国家与人民，他们现在还是不信任其他的国家与人民。因此，他们正在准备使用大规模毁灭的武器来对付这些国家。这就是他们的第二个论据，二十六年以前的情形，和今天的情形并没有什么两样。
    第三个论据。我们从参议院的正式记录里可以看出：赞成批准日内瓦议定书的参议员波拉，曾从‘华盛顿邮报’上援引了一大段话，那一段话说：最积极反对批准日内瓦议定书的，是著名的反动的‘美国退伍军人团’和其他的军事团体，支持这些团体的还有美国的许多化学公司，他们惟恐美国批准了日内瓦议定书以后，就要影响到他们的‘营业’，影响到他们的利润，而美国的制造死亡的商人因此也要受到损失。同样一些制造死亡的商人，现在不仅制造化学武器，而且还制造细菌武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭的武器，他们在一九五二年也反对禁止细菌武器与化学武器，恰像他们反对批准日内瓦议定书一样。在这些地方历史是在重演了。
    以上是三个具有决定性的因素，说明为什么美国在二十多年以来没有批准日内瓦议定书，为什么美国在一九二六年没有批准日内瓦议定书而且现在还不愿意批准，以及为什么美国反对苏联所提安理会应号召各国参加和批准日内瓦议定书的提案。
    诚如英国代表所说，苏联不仅批准了日内瓦议定书，而且还立刻采取了措施来改进这个议定书，英国代表在这里详细援引的一些话，只有使我的工作更加便利。
    英国代表曾经追述说：苏联政府在批准了日内瓦议定书后，曾于一九二九年四月提交国际联盟各组织一项建议，要求在日内瓦议定书中增加条款，规定在该协定生效后三个月之内，把所有进行化学战及细菌战的一切器材与装备均予毁灭；规定在日内瓦议定书生效之日起，制造化学战和细菌战的器材的企业应停止生产；并规定这些企业中建立工人管制。
    我自己本来要想说这些话的，但是英国代表替我说了。我对这一点很感谢他。
    但是，他没有说到英国和美国曾阻止采纳苏联的建议这一个事实。当苏联提出这项改进日内瓦议定书的建议后，那时英国代表团领导着英法集团——正如今日美国代表团领导着美英集团一样——阻止了采纳苏联的建议。
    这一事在另一方面又显出，苏联并不只限于仅仅批准日内瓦议定书而已。它并且立刻采取措施以改进日内瓦议定书，它严格地遵守着这个议定书，并相信这项议定书是禁止化学战和细菌战的有效国际工具。这就是二十六年前苏联的态度。也正是它今天的态度。
    我并且可以说，苏联在批准日内瓦议定书之后，曾立即向国际联盟各组织提出一项建议，要求向所有已签署议定书但尚未批准议定书的各国发出呼吁，号召它们尽速批准。这个提案曾被为召开裁减军备会议的筹备委员会通过了。但是美国还是不理会这个决议，并且直到今天还没有批准议定书。
    苏联在一九三二年又提出一个类似的提案。美国像从前一样反对批准。这些都是无可辩驳的事实。
    反对苏联提案的人们企图说明，他们之所以反对是因为他们认为有必要拟订一个普遍裁减军备计划，而禁止细菌武器的规定将是这个计划的一部分。自然，没有人否认这一点。自从联合国组织建立的那一天起，许多年以来苏联一直在作巨大的努力，想制订一个包括一切因素——禁止原子武器，禁止各种其他类型的大规模屠杀武器，包括细菌武器、化学武器及其他武器，实际而有效地裁减武装部队和军备——在内的总计划；但是，由于大家都知道的原因，这种协定到现在还没有成立。
    在这种情形下，安全理事会为什么不理睬一个已经存在的经普遍承认为有用而有效的国际协定呢？安理会的若干理事国为什么避不支持这个已经存在的国际协定、拒绝敦促世界上所有国家参加这个协定并予以批准呢？在一个更好的国际协定还没有缔结以前，难道这个协定不会对和平事业有所裨益吗？对于这个问题，只可能有一个答案：是的，如果各国都参加了这个规定禁用化学及细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，这将是走向巩固和平和国际安全的一个重大的、实际的和有效的步骤。
    但是，英国代表杰伯和他的美国伙伴亦步亦趋，支持美国的意图、主张将苏联提案交给裁减军备委员会。杰伯不答覆我的问题：难道他认为安理会号召各国参加并批准日内瓦议定书——英国代表也不否认它的重要性——的呼吁会在任何程度上妨碍联合国裁减军备委员会拟订一个更好的、更完善的、包括裁减军备计划的一切因素——禁用原子武器、禁用其他一切类型的大规模屠杀武器，减裁武装部队和军备，监督，各国提供关于军备的充分正式情报以及这种情报的审核——在内的国际协定吗？英国代表对这个问题避不作答。他说，对这个问题既不能答‘是’也不能答‘否’。但是，这个问题是我们目前所讨论的问题的关键所在，因为安全理事会的呼吁绝不会妨碍联合国裁减军备委员会继续进行裁减军备和禁用原子武器问题方面的工作。
    相反地，这样一个呼吁将促进这个委员会的工作。在还没有更好的新东西以前，我们切不可忽视有用的旧东西，把它撇在一边，只有在准备新侵略行动的人，只有在准备发动另一次世界大战的人，只有在准备使用细菌武器及其他各种大规模毁灭的武器的人，才会散播宣传，说日内瓦议定书已经
    ‘过时’这种宣传是敌视全人类而且违反国际法的起码标准的。”
    马立克接着谈到日内瓦议定书所产生的约束力。
    马立克说：“日内瓦议定书给各个国家、各个政府和各民族的巨大约束力，使美国统治集团不得不采取规避、搪塞的手段不去批准这个议定书，其原因上面已经谈过了。我们今天所作讨论，我们今天所考虑问题的本质，其意义即在于此。
    因此，这个讨论表明了反对苏联提案的人无法驳倒这个提案的力量和逻辑。他们无法贬低日内瓦议定书的重要性。不消说，他们之间有些人是狼狈为奸的。这从他们的发言中可以看出来。但是，假如有这种用心的话，这就是那些批准这个国际协定的人直接违反日内瓦议定书的行动。”
    马立克最后说：“苏联代表团认为，美国的建议是破了产的、没有诚意的，它的目的是要把苏联的提案送到裁减军备委员会去，并把它埋葬在那里，就像苏联提出的许多真正为了禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭的武器的建议被埋葬了那样，就像苏联提出的许多关于真正裁减军备和武装部队的建议被埋葬在这个委员会和先前的一些委员会中那样。
    苏联代表团坚决反对美国代表团的这种用心。”
