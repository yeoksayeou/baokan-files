    中共 Gan Cheng County Committee's Self-Criticism on Neglecting the Training of Miao Cadres
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column published on May 15 contained a reader's letter criticizing our leadership style. We accept this criticism.
    There are 41,000 Miao people in our county, accounting for 42 percent of the county's population. There are 43 Miao cadres in the county, including three deputy district chiefs, one deputy section chief, and one county government secretary. The majority of the rest are district assistant-level cadres. This shows that the county committee does not yet understand the great significance of the instruction "Let the Miao people stand up and be masters of their own affairs and rely on the Miao people themselves to carry out work in the Miao area," and has not yet studied Chairman Mao's ethnic policy well.
    We have now paid attention to this issue and decided to actively cultivate and promote Miao activists. In the past, we were not bold enough in promoting cadres, which was wrong. We must correct this immediately.
    Regarding the matter of Comrade Chen Yulou, the secretary of the county committee, suppressing criticism, we have already conducted a review. He has recognized the seriousness of this issue and expressed his willingness to strengthen his studies and ensure that similar errors do not occur again.

### 中共干城县委员会对忽视培养苗族干部的检讨

    中共干城县委员会对忽视培养苗族干部的检讨
    编辑同志：五月十五日“读者来信”栏刊载了读者来信，对我们的领导作风提出批评。我们接受这个批评。
    我县苗族人民有四万一千人，占全县人口百分之四十二。全县苗族干部四十三人，其中有三个副区长、一个副科长、一个县政府秘书，其余大半是区助理级的干部。这说明县委还不了解“让苗族人民自己起来当家作主，依靠苗族人民自己来开展苗区工作”这一指示的重大意义，还没有很好地学习毛主席的民族政策。
    现在我们已经注意了这个问题，决定积极培养、提拔苗族积极分子。过去我们提拔干部还不够大胆放手，这是错误的。我们要立即加以纠正。
    对于县委书记陈玉楼同志压制批评的事情，我们已经作过检查，他已经认识到这个问题的严重性，表示愿意加强学习，保证不再发生类似错误。
     中共干城县委员会
