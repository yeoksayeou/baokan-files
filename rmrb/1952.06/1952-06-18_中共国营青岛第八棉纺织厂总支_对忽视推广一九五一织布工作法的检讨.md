To the Editorial Board:

Last November, our factory began promoting the 1951 weaving method. All employees enthusiastically studied it, and the output and quality of cloth significantly improved, while the rate of substandard cloth decreased. However, in late December of last year, just as the 1951 weaving method was being fully promoted, Deputy Director Yang Guangxu became arrogant and complacent, self-righteous, and belittled the workers' labor and creativity, demanding that workers implement a non-patrolling "end" (strand) operation method. The gains achieved after the promotion of the 1951 weaving method could not be consolidated as a result, and this created chaos in the workshop. One of the reasons for these errors is that our Party General Branch Committee had serious bureaucratic tendencies in its leadership, failing to fully exert the supervisory and guaranteeing role of the Party in enterprises and mines. Usually, we rarely study production work, nor do we humbly learn production knowledge; we also lacked sufficient understanding that promoting advanced production experience is one of the important methods for completing the production increase and conservation plan. After the promotion of the 1951 weaving method, we did not take all effective measures and steps to consolidate it. At the same time, we rarely went deep into the workshops to understand the production situation of the workers and masses, often being satisfied with the figures on the reports. Therefore, we also failed to promptly discover and correct the errors of Yang Guangxu and others in resisting the promotion of the 1951 weaving method.

In order to correct this error, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee and the efforts of all employees, we have taken emergency measures to restore the promotion of the 1951 weaving method. Recently, the rate of substandard cloth has been reduced to below 2%, and the output has increased to 46 yards per machine.

    对忽视推广一九五一织布工作法的检讨
    编辑同志：去年十一月底我厂开始推广一九五
    一织布工作法。全厂职工热心学习，布的产量、质量显著提高，次布率降低。但是，去年十二月下旬，正当一九五一织布工作法全面推广的时候，副厂长杨光煦骄傲自满，自以为是，轻视工人的劳动创造，要工人实行不巡回绺子的操作法。推广一九五一织布工作法以后已获得的成绩因此不能巩固，并造成车间工作的混乱现象。发生这些错误的原因之一，是我们党总支委员会在领导方面有严重的官僚主义，没有充分发挥党在企业工矿中的监督和保证作用。平常，我们很少研究生产工作，也不虚心学习生产知识；对推广先进生产经验是完成增产节约计划的重要方法之一也认识不足。一九五一织布工作法推广以后，我们没有采取一切有效办法和措施去巩固它。同时，我们很少深入车间了解职工群众的生产情况，往往满足于报表上的数字。所以，也不能及时发现、纠正杨光煦等抗拒推广一九五一织布工作法的错误。
    为纠正这一错误，在上级党委的领导和全体职工的努力下，我们已采取紧急措施，恢复了一九五一织布工作法的推广工作。最近，次布率已降低到百分之二以下，产量已提高到每台产四十六码。
