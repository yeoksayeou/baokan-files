To the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front:

The Korean War, which has garnered the focused attention of people worldwide, has reached its second anniversary.

The valiant Korean people, in their arduous struggle against aggression over the past two years, have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic fervor, repelling the attacks of the American aggressors, defending the independence of their motherland, and making a great contribution to the cause of world peace. On this anniversary of the War Against America, we, the various democratic parties of China, extend our combat salute and heartfelt greetings to you and the Korean people on behalf of all the Chinese people.

Aggression against Korea is an integral part of the US imperialists' overall war policy of aggression against Asia and the world. The American aggressors originally intended a swift victory, aiming to swallow the whole of Korea in a short period, and further expand the war. This arrogant attempt has been completely shattered. The American aggressors were forced to accept ceasefire negotiations, yet at the negotiating table, they vainly attempted to use blackmail and intimidation to gain what they could not achieve on the battlefield. This shameless conspiracy has also been thoroughly exposed. The use of all kinds of shameless means that violate humanity and trample on international conventions, and weapons of mass murder such as bacteriological bombs, napalm bombs, and poison gas, have aroused the public indignation of the people of the world. The shameless crimes of large-scale massacre of captured Korean and Chinese personnel on Geoje Island have been deemed an indefensible disgrace even within the aggressive bloc itself. All of this demonstrates that the increasing frenzy of US imperialism only further exposes its own狰狞 appearance and despicable behavior.

The brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, as close as lips and teeth, has been further solidified by the heroic blood shed together in our common struggle against aggression. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, have been fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army for one year and eight months, with the understanding that we share weal and woe, and that our survival is intertwined. Today, we, the various democratic parties of China, are even more willing to reiterate the common will of our 500 million Chinese people before the Korean people and the people of the world.

Resisting America and aiding Korea is the solemn task of the Chinese people, and the just actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers are the supreme glory of all the Chinese people. Our aim has always been consistently to resolve the Korean issue peacefully under fair and reasonable conditions. Korean internal affairs should be handled by the Korean people themselves and should not be subject to any external interference. To achieve this goal, we must do our best to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. No matter how mad and brutal the aggressors are, they cannot change our will.

For the dignity of mankind, we resolutely oppose the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors.

For the inviolability of human rights, we cannot sit idly by in the face of the crimes of the American aggressors in slaughtering captured Korean and Chinese soldiers.

In order to reach a ceasefire agreement in Korea on a fair and reasonable basis, we resolutely oppose all the arrogant and unreasonable attitudes and deliberate provocative means of the American aggressors in delaying and sabotaging the negotiations. Only the issue of prisoner repatriation remains in the Korean armistice negotiations. As long as we act in accordance with the Geneva Convention and repatriate all prisoners of war on both sides, the armistice agreement can be immediately implemented, and further political negotiations can begin immediately.

The people of the world are watching the situation in the Korean War with great concern. This is because they see the significance of defending world peace in the actions of the people of Korea and China in resisting aggression. For the sake of human justice, for international security, and for the peaceful coexistence of all nations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we, the Chinese people, are willing to unite more closely with the Korean people and all peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the world, and fight to the end against wars of aggression.

This is the common will of the Chinese people, and we believe it must also be the common will of the Korean people and the common will of all peace-loving and justice-seeking people in the world. Our strength is incomparably strong. The vast majority of people in the world need peace; only a few warmongers need war.

The Korean War has been going on for two years, but we firmly believe that as long as we strengthen unity, as long as the peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the world strengthen unity, we have the power to stop the spread of war and the power to make peace win the final victory.

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the war against aggression!

Long live the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, solidified by heroic blood!

Long live peace and democracy!

    中国各民主党派纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年
    向朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会致敬电朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会：
    全世界人民所集中关注的朝鲜战争已满两周年了。
    英勇的朝鲜人民，在两年来反抗侵略的坚苦斗争中，表现了高度的爱国热诚，打退了美国侵略者的进攻，保卫了自己祖国的独立，并对世界和平事业作出了伟大的贡献。在这抗美战争两周年的纪念日，我们中国各民主党派谨代表全中国人民向你们及朝鲜人民致战斗的敬礼和亲切的慰问。
    侵略朝鲜是美帝国主义侵略亚洲、侵略世界的整个战争政策的组成部分。美国侵略者原想速战速决，在短时日内吞灭全朝鲜，更进而扩大战争，它的这一狂妄的企图已被彻底粉碎了。美国侵略者被迫接受停战谈判，而它在谈判桌上竟妄想用讹诈恐吓的手段来取得在战场上所不能取得的东西，它的这一无耻的阴谋也已被彻底揭穿了。一切违背人道、蹂躏国际公约的无耻手段和大规模杀人的武器如细菌弹、凝固汽油弹、毒瓦斯等的使用，已激起了全世界人民的公愤。巨济岛上大规模虐杀朝中被俘人员的无耻罪行，连侵略集团内部都认为是无可粉饰的丑态。这一切都说明：美帝国主义的愈加疯狂只是愈加暴露它自己的狰狞面目和卑怯行为。
    中朝两国人民唇齿相依的兄弟友谊，在我们共同反抗侵略的斗争中，已由流在一起的英雄的血液而更加牢固了。我们中国人民的优秀儿女中国人民志愿军，在休戚相关、存亡与共的认识之下，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战以来已一年零八个月。我们中国各民主党派在今天更愿在朝鲜人民和全世界人民面前重申我们五万万中国人民的共同意志。
    抗美援朝是我们中国人民的庄严任务，中国人民志愿军的正义行动是我们全中国人民的无尚光荣。我们的目的始终一贯地是在公平合理的条件之下和平解决朝鲜问题，朝鲜内政应由朝鲜人民自行处理，不应受任何外来的干涉。为了达到这一目的，我们要尽力支持朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，无论侵略者怎样疯狂横暴决不能改变我们的意志。
    为了人类的尊严，我们坚决反对美国侵略者所进行的细菌战。
    为了人权的不可侵犯，我们对于美国侵略者屠杀朝中战俘的罪行决不能坐视不理。
    为了在公平合理的基础上达成朝鲜停战协议，我们坚决反对美国侵略者拖延和破坏谈判的一切横暴无理的态度和蓄意挑衅的手段。朝鲜停战谈判只剩下一个遣俘问题，只要照着日内瓦公约办事，彼此遣返全部被俘人员，停战协议便可以立即实现，更进一步的政治谈判也就可以立即开始。
    全世界人民都以极大的关怀注视着朝鲜战争的局势。这是因为他们从朝中两国人民反抗侵略的行动中看出了保卫世界和平的意义。为了人类的正义，为了国际的安全，为了在平等互利的基础上各国人民的和平共处，我们中国人民愿和朝鲜人民一起，更紧密地联合世界上一切爱好和平正义的各国人民，为反对侵略战争而奋斗到底。
    这就是我们中国人民的共同意志，我们相信这也一定是朝鲜人民的共同意志，全世界爱好和平正义的人民的共同意志，我们的力量是无比雄厚的，全世界绝大多数的人民都需要和平，只有少数的战争贩子才需要战争。
    朝鲜战争已经绵亘两年了，但我们坚决相信，只要我们加强团结，只要全世界爱好和平正义的人民加强团结，我们有力量制止战争的蔓延，也有力量使和平赢得最后的胜利。
    在反抗侵略的战争中牺牲了的烈士们永垂不朽！
    由英雄的血液牢固了的中朝人民的兄弟友谊万岁！
    和平民主胜利万岁！
