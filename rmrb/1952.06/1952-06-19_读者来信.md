    Reader Letters

    Refuting Cowdry and Dubos's sophistry on the U.S. germ warfare

    To the Editor: We, along with the joint statement made by 29 bacteriology workers in the capital, including Fang Gang, published in the People's Daily on June 9, refute the sophistry made by American scientists Cowdry and Dubos for the American germ warfare criminals. We stand on the position of bacteriology workers and on the position of human justice to express our firm support for this statement.

    The fact that the inhuman American aggressors used bacteriological weapons in Korea and our country has been proven by on-the-spot investigations and research conducted by many scientists. After American air force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn confessed the detailed process of dropping bacteriological bombs, the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors is even more conclusive and cannot be denied. However, American scientists Cowdry and Dubos shamelessly defended the murderous robbers and aggressive beasts in American newspapers. This not only violates their conscience, but also fundamentally violates the principles of science. Our purpose in studying bacteriology is to protect human health and promote human happiness. However, the aggressors steal the achievements of scientific research and use sacred bacteriology as a weapon of murder and a tool of aggression. We now lodge a solemn protest and warning to the so-called "scientific workers" in the United States who research and manufacture bacteriological weapons. We firmly support the statement of the bacteriology workers in the capital, we firmly oppose the shameless sophistry of American scientists, and we will fight to the end to smash the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors.

    Opinions on the Return of Specialized Technical Personnel

    To the Editor: I agree with the short commentary "Overcoming departmentalism and reasonably using specialized talent" and the opinions of comrades Dong Zhenyu and five others published on page 3 of the People's Daily on May 19. I am a person who studied engineering but is doing administrative work. I previously suggested "returning to work in the industrial sector," but was labeled with "ideological problems" and "not being content with my work." After May 19, I again expressed my hope to return to a technical position. The leadership said: "The People's Daily is right, but the situation here is different. You should proceed from the overall perspective. If all the technical cadres are transferred away, it will affect the work of this department." They also said: "There are many cadres who are not using their expertise, and they should be transferred according to a comprehensive plan. Although your personal work can be transferred away, other comrades also have other specialties (such as a love for literature and art), and they also want to be transferred away, so the work cannot be done. Don't just think about yourself." He used these words to prevent specialized technical cadres from returning to their posts.

    Perhaps this situation is not isolated. Therefore, I agree with the opinion of Comrade Yu Fangwu in the "Reader Letters" column of the People's Daily on May 28, that is, to launch a movement for specialized technical cadres to return to their posts. This movement should be combined with the democratic supplementary lessons and organizational adjustments after the "Three Antis" campaign.

    Suggestion to Conduct a National Survey of Specialized Technical Cadres

    To the Editor: In order to comprehensively and thoroughly solve the problem of the return of specialized technical personnel, we suggest that the central competent department conduct a survey of specialized technical personnel in various departments across the country, and then make an overall allocation according to the actual needs of various economic construction-related departments in various regions. Through this survey, we can grasp the situation of technical cadres in various departments across the country, and we can also formulate plans for the current and future training of technical cadres. In this way, the phenomenon of uneven allocation of technical cadres in various departments will be overcome.

    Overcoming Bureaucratism from the Zhang Shunyou Incident

    To the Editor: From the Zhang Shunyou incident, it can be seen that there is extremely serious bureaucratic work style among some provincial and county-level cadres. In addition to suggesting that the Party Central Committee compile the course of this incident into a document and issue it to Party, government, public security, and court organs at all levels for discussion in conjunction with the work of their own units, I also thought of two issues: (1) There is still such a situation in many places: that is, if the masses go to the lower-level government to request a solution to a problem, and the lower-level government's solution is not satisfactory or does not provide a solution, the masses dare not directly report to the higher-level government. If they report it, the cadres of the original handling agency will consider it "going over their heads," which hurts their "face," and they will be greatly dissatisfied, and even retaliate. This issue is quite serious. I suggest that the government issue a notice to cadres at all levels that if the masses believe that the original agency is not satisfied with the handling of the requested issue, they can appeal to a higher level. The higher level must not ignore it because it goes over their heads, and the lower level must not implement any overt or covert blows or retaliation against the masses who appeal to a higher level. (2) Sometimes the masses report situations or defend right and wrong to the higher-level government, but the higher-level government carelessly studies the matter and transfers the letter to the original agency for processing, which often results in retaliation against the masses. Therefore, I suggest that governments at all levels should repeatedly study and carefully handle the situations reported by the masses over their heads, and do not easily transfer the letters down.

    The Zhang Shunyou Incident Educated Me and I Examined My Own Bureaucratic Work Style

    To the Editor: The "Zhang Shunyou Incident" educated me, and I earnestly examined my work over the past six months. I work in the Nenjiang County People's Court in Heilongjiang Province doing trial work. In April of this year, the Labor Section of the People's Government of our county transferred a case in which an illegal capitalist dismissed an accountant on the pretext, tore up account pages and receipts, falsely accused the accountant of embezzlement, and refused to pay wages. At that time, I put this case aside. It was not until the accountant urged the court several times that I dealt with the case. In February of this year, a person's horse in the urban area of the county was stabbed to death by a bad person. The public security police station introduced this matter to our court for handling. I excused that the perpetrator had not been arrested and pushed it to the public security bureau's security section to handle. Later, this case was repeatedly transferred and pushed around and has not been resolved. The plaintiff and victim never came again. I also forgot about this matter. The "Zhang Shunyou Incident" occurred, and I thought of this matter again. However, the victim had already said sadly and disappointedly: "There is no way, just let it be stabbed to death!" My irresponsible work style has left a very bad impression among the people.

    My bureaucratic work style is very serious. In addition to immediately examining this wrong attitude and making the necessary remedies, I am determined to accept the lesson of the "Zhang Shunyou Incident," study hard, improve my political awareness, and honestly be a responsible public servant.
    Tong Dexuan, Judge, Nenjiang County People's Court, Heilongjiang Province

    I Support Jilin Province's Method of Establishing a "Centralized Receiving and Dispatching Station"

    To the Editor: I was very happy to see the "Jilin Provincial People's Government General Office Improves Receiving and Dispatching System and Creates Centralized Receiving and Dispatching Letters Method" published in the People's Daily on June 12. I am a correspondent at the Central Academy of Drama. I do not have a fixed time to deliver letters every day; often, I have just returned from delivering letters, and I have to go to deliver letters again, still to the same unit. When our academy performs, I have to send admission tickets to many units, which takes five or six hours. This delays other work and causes a waste of manpower, materials, and time. Comrades who do correspondence work cannot study on time or eat on time, which affects their health. Therefore, I think the method of centralized receiving and dispatching letters created by the General Office of the Jilin Provincial People's Government is very good, which can improve work efficiency, save manpower, materials, and time. I suggest that various agencies and groups in Beijing also consider establishing a "centralized receiving and dispatching station."

    Suzhou Branch of China Native Produce Company
    All Employees Actively Promote the Sale of Slow-Moving and Substandard Goods

    To the Editor: In the past month, all employees of the Suzhou Branch of China Native Produce Company have actively promoted the sale of goods, saving more than 500 million yuan worth of slow-moving and substandard goods from mildew and backlog.

    This spring, after the company launched the "Three Antis" campaign, because the cadres were busy fighting "tigers," they temporarily relaxed their business work, causing a large number of red dates, black dates, peach jade, apricot preserves, ramie, longan, down, honey dates, and other commodities to be backlogged in the warehouse and unable to be sold. Some of these commodities are now approaching the off-season, and some are beginning to be infested with insects and mildew; they are now facing the plum rain season. If they are not sold in time, a large amount of materials will suffer undue losses. After studying this situation, the company's leadership immediately drew out some comrades to form a sales team to go out to promote sales without affecting the fight against "tigers." The warehouse keepers also stepped up the drying and processing.

    The comrades of the sales team adopted the method of delivering goods to the door, loading the goods on the car and going deep into the agencies, factories, neighborhoods, and villages to vigorously promote sales, which was very popular among the masses. In their sales, they not only sold slow-moving and substandard goods, but also expanded the sales area. The company had a lot of ramie that could not be sold, which affected the turnover of funds, but the sack shops wanted to use ramie but did not know where to buy it; now the difficulties on both sides have been resolved, and future users have been fixed. When the sales team went deep into Shengze and Baichi in Wujiang County, they were also welcomed by small merchants.

    This time, the company not only completed the task of promoting the sale of slow-moving and substandard goods, but also initially changed its past business style of sitting at the door, laying a good foundation for vigorously developing the purchase and sale of local specialties in the future.

    斥寇兰和杜波斯对美国进行细菌战的诡辩
    编辑同志：六月九日人民日报刊载了首都细菌学工作者方纲等二十九人发表的联合声明，驳斥美国科学家寇兰和杜波斯二人替美国细菌战犯们所作的诡辩。我们站在细菌学工作者的立场上，站在人类正义的立场上，对这个声明表示坚决拥护。
    灭绝人性的美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国使用细菌武器的事实，已经由许多科学家进行的实地调查、研究所证明了。美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩供认了投掷细菌弹的详细经过后，美国侵略者使用细菌武器，更是铁证如山，无法狡赖了。可是美国科学家寇兰和杜波斯却在美国报纸上卑鄙无耻地替杀人强盗、侵略野兽们进行辩护，这不但违背了他们的良心，而且根本违反了科学的原则。我们研究细菌学的目的是保障人类健康，增进人类幸福。而侵略者们却窃取科学研究的成果，把神圣的细菌学作为杀人的武器，作为侵略的工具。我们现在对研究和制造细菌武器的美国的所谓“科学工作者”提出严正抗议和警告。我们坚决拥护首都细菌学工作者们的声明，我们坚决反对美国科学家的无耻诡辩，我们要为粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争到底。江苏医学院细菌学科教授陈少伯技术员瞿伯超

    对专门技术人才归队的意见
    编辑同志：我同意人民日报五月十九日第三版所载“克服本位主义思想，合理地使用专门人才”的简评和董振玉等六位同志的意见。我是一个学过工科而做着事务工作的人，我以前曾经提过“返回工业部门工作”的意见，但被扣上了“思想问题”、“不安心工作”等帽子。五月十九日之后，我又提出了希望回到技术岗位去工作的意见。领导方面说：“人民日报讲得很对，但我们这里情况不同，你应该从全局观点出发。如果把技术干部都调走，将会影响本部门的工作。”又说：“学非所用的干部很多，应全盘计划调动；现在虽然你个人的工作可以调开，但其他同志也有其他特长（如喜好文艺等），也要求调走，这样工作就没法做了。你不要只为个人打算。”他用这些话来阻碍专门技术干部归队。
    也许这种情况不是个别的。所以，我同意五月二十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏余芳吾同志提出的意见，即发动一个专门技术干部归队运动。这一运动应结合“三反”后的民主补课、调整机构来做。

    建议进行一次全国专门技术干部的调查
    编辑同志：为了全面地、彻底地解决专门技术人才归队的问题，我们建议：由中央主管部门，进行一次对于全国各部门专门技术人才的调查，然后按照各地各经济建设有关部门的实际需要，来一个总的调配。通过这个调查，可以掌握全国各部门技术干部的情况，更可以订出目前和今后培养技术干部的计划。这样，便会克服各部门技术干部调配不均的现象。

    由张顺有事件想到克服官僚主义的办法
    编辑同志：从赶车工人张顺有事件，可以看出在某些省级、县级干部中有极为严重的官僚主义作风。我除了建议党中央将这一事件发生的经过整理成文件颁发各级党、政、公安、法院机关结合本单位工作进行讨论外，还想到两个问题：（一）现在许多地方还有这种情况存在：即如果群众到下级政府要求解决问题，而下级政府解决得不满意或不给解决时，群众即不敢再直接向上一级政府反映。如果反映了，原处理这件事的机关干部就认为是“越级”，有伤“面子”，要大为不满，甚至进行报复。这一问题是相当严重的。我建议政府通令各级干部，如群众认为原机关对所要求处理的问题不满意时，可以越级上诉，上级不得因越级而不理，下级对越级上诉的群众也不得施行明的或暗的打击、报复。（二）有时群众向上级政府反映情况或申辩是非，但上级政府不慎重研究就把来件转给原机关处理，结果往往使群众受到报复。所以，我建议各级政府对群众越级反映的情况，应反复研究、慎重处理，不要轻易把来件转下去。  何文涛
    张顺有事件教育了我检查了自己的官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：“张顺有事件”教育了我，我认真地检查了我半年来的工作。我是在黑龙江省嫩江县人民法院做审判工作的。今年四月间，我县人民政府劳动科转来一件违法资本家借故解雇司账员，扯毁账页票据，反诬司账员贪污，拒付工资的案子。当时我把这个案子搁置起来，直到这个司账员几次来法院催促，我才处理了这个案子。今年二月间，县城区一个人的马，被坏人扎死了，公安派出所把这件事介绍到我们法院处理。我藉口案犯没有逮住，又推给公安局治安科去办。以后，这件案子又经几次辗转推送，一直没有解决。原告受害人再也不来了。我也把这件事丢到脑后去了。“张顺有事件”发生，我才又想起了这件事。可是，受害人已经伤心失望地说：“没办法，扎死就扎死了吧！”我这种不负责任的作风，已经在人民群众中留下很坏的印象。
    我的官僚主义作风是十分严重的。我除了立即检查这种错误态度并作必要的补救外，决心接受“张顺有事件”的教训，努力学习，提高政治觉悟，老老实实地作一个负责的人民勤务员。

    我拥护吉林省建立“集中收发站”的办法
    编辑同志：我看到人民日报六月十二日发表的“吉林省人民政府办公厅改进收发制度创造集中收发信件办法”以后，心里非常高兴。我是中央戏剧学院的一个通信员，每天没有固定的送信时间；常常刚送信回来，就又要去送信，还是送往同一单位。当我们院里演出时，我要送入场券到许多单位去，一去就要五、六个小时。因此耽误了其他工作，造成了人力、物力和时间上的浪费。我们做通信工作的同志，不能按时学习，也不能按时吃饭，影响了身体的健康。所以，我认为吉林省人民政府办公厅所创造的集中收发信件的办法很好，既可提高工作效率，又可节省人力、物力和时间。我建议北京市各机关、团体也考虑建立“集中收发站”。

    中国土产公司苏州支公司
    全体职工积极推销冷货和次货
    编辑同志：中国土产公司苏州支公司全体职工一个月来积极推销货物使五亿多元的冷货次货免于霉坏和积压。
    今年春天，该公司开展“三反”运动以后，因干部忙于打“虎”，一时放松了业务工作，致使大批红枣、黑枣、桃玉、杏脯、络麻、桂圆、毛、蜜枣、等商品，积压在仓库里销不出去。这些商品，有的现在已临淡季，有的开始被虫蛀、霉烂；目前又面临黄梅季节，如不及时推销出去，将使大批物资受到不应有的损失。公司领导方面研究这种情况后，在不影响打“虎”的情况下，马上抽出一部分同志组成推销组出外推销。仓库的保管同志也加紧进行翻晒、加工。
    推销组同志采取了送货上门的办法，把货物装上车，分别深入机关、工厂、里弄、乡村进行大力推销，很受群众欢迎。他们在推销中，不但推销了冷次货，而且扩大了销售面。公司存着很多络麻销不出去，影响了资金周转，但麻袋店要用麻却不知到那里去买；现在双方面的困难都解决了，并且固定了今后的用户。当推销组深入吴江县盛泽、八?等地时，也受到小商户的欢迎。
    该公司这次不但完成了推销冷次货的任务，并且初步改变了过去坐守门户的经营作风，给今后大力开展土特产的购销工作，打下了良好的基础。
