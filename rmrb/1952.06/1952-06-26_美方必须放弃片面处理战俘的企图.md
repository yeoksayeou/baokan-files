    The American aggressors are exhausting all means to increase obstacles to the Korean armistice negotiations. The American headquarters in Tokyo announced on the 22nd that it was preparing to illegally classify 27,000 of our captured personnel as so-called "South Korean civilians" and hand them over to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Obviously, this is another conspiracy by the American aggressors to deliberately sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. This not only completely destroys all customary and international laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, but it is also a despicable and barbaric act unprecedented in the history of diplomatic negotiations. Our chief negotiator, General Nam Il, sternly condemned this illegal attempt by the U.S. side at the negotiation meeting on the 23rd and declared that our side will never recognize this illegal handling of our captured personnel by the U.S. side.

    The U.S. side's excuse for illegally handling our captured personnel is completely untenable. They forcibly "classify" our captured personnel, separating out so-called "South Korean civilians." Furthermore, the U.S. headquarters' announcement on the 22nd stated: "The names of these 27,000 individuals are not included in the prisoner-of-war list exchanged by the armistice negotiation representatives at Panmunjom on December 18, 1951." People know that the prisoner-of-war list that the U.S. side gave us that time was more than 44,000 people less than the prisoner-of-war list previously given by the U.S. side through the International Committee of the Red Cross. According to the materials provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross, among these 44,000 people, a total of 34,786 were regular troops of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. This cannot but expose that the U.S. side's preparation to "release" "civilians" is actually one of the conspiratorial steps they are preparing to illegally detain our captured personnel.

    The U.S. headquarters also admitted that they classified our captured personnel as "civilians" "after thorough and complete loyalty screening." However, the U.S. side's so-called screening is fundamentally contrary to the Geneva Convention, and therefore absolutely cannot be allowed. Moreover, Colonel Colson, the former head of the U.S. side's Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, had already publicly confessed that the U.S. side's so-called "screening" was nothing more than a synonym for atrocities and massacres. Furthermore, the U.S. headquarters' announcement on the 22nd also stated: "These civilians are currently being detained in prisoner camps in Yeongcheon and Busan." People certainly still remember that not long ago (May 20th and May 29th), the American aggressors successively created appalling bloody incidents in the Busan and Yeongcheon prisoner camps in order to forcibly "screen" our captured personnel, killing and wounding a total of 102 of our captured personnel (86 in the Busan prisoner camp and 16 in Yeongcheon). Obviously, no matter how good the American aggressors are at lying and denying, they cannot conceal their crimes of forcibly detaining our captured personnel by means of massacre.

    The illegal attempt by the American aggressors to hand over our captured personnel to the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is entirely for the purpose of rearming our captured personnel and forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. This was also openly admitted in Colson's confession. Moreover, the spokesman of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's Ministry of National Defense openly admitted in an interview with a Reuters reporter on February 20th of this year: "The South Korean government wants the United Nations to release 'democracy-inclined' civilians to supplement South Korea's manpower." Hasn't this sinister intention of the American aggressors already been completely exposed?

    Obviously, this reckless criminal attempt by the American aggressors will cause the Korean armistice negotiations, which have fallen into a stalemate due to the prisoner-of-war issue, to encounter a new obstacle. The American aggressors must immediately abandon this attempt, otherwise they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom and will be subjected to doubly severe punishment by the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people of the world.

    美方必须放弃片面处理战俘的企图
    美国侵略者正在用尽一切方法增加朝鲜停战谈判的障碍。东京的美方总部于二十二日宣布，准备将二万七千名我方被俘人员非法分类为所谓“南朝鲜平民”送交李承晚匪帮。显然，这是美国侵略者蓄意破坏朝鲜停战谈判的又一阴谋。这不仅是彻底地破坏了对待战俘问题的一切习惯法和国际法，而且在外交谈判的历史上也是没有前例的卑鄙蛮横的做法。我方首席谈判代表南日将军，在二十三日的谈判会议上对美方的这一非法企图已严词加以斥责，并声明我方绝不承认美方对我方被俘人员的这种非法处理。
    美方非法处理我方被俘人员的借口是完全不能成立的。他们硬把我方被俘人员加以“分类”，从中分出所谓“南朝鲜平民”，而且美方总部在二十二日所发表的公告中还说：“这二万七千个人的名字没有包括在一九五一年十二月十八日停战谈判代表在板门店交换的战俘名单上。”人们知道，美方在那次交给我方的战俘名单，比前此美方经由红十字国际委员会交来的战俘名单少了四万四千多人，而根据红十字国际委员会交来的材料，在这四万多人中，共有三万四千七百八十六人是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的正规部队人员。这就不能不暴露出，美方准备“释放”“平民”，实际上就是他们准备非法扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋步骤之一。
    美方总部又承认，他们把我方被俘人员分类为“平民”，是“经过彻底的、完全的忠诚甄别”。然而，美方的所谓甄别根本是违反日内瓦公约的，因而是绝对不能容许的，而且，前美方巨济岛战俘营负责人柯尔生早已公开供认，美方的所谓“甄别”不过是暴行和屠杀的代名词。而且，美方总部在二十二日的公告中又说：“这些平民现在被拘留在永川和釜山的俘虏营中”。人们当然还记得，就在不久以前（五月二十日和五月二十九日）美国侵略者曾先后在釜山和永川俘虏营中，为了对我方被俘人员实行强迫“甄别”而制造了骇人听闻的流血惨案，共打死打伤我方被俘人员一百零二名（釜山俘虏营八十六名，永川十六名）。显然，美国侵略者无论怎样善于撒谎和抵赖，也无法掩饰他们以屠杀手段强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行了。
    美国侵略者将我方被俘人员交给李承晚匪帮的非法企图，其目的完全是为了将我方被俘人员重新武装起来，并强迫他们去为李承晚匪帮当炮灰。这在柯尔生的供词中也是公开招认了的。而且李承晚匪帮的国防部发言人在本年二月二十日对路透社记者发表的谈话中，也曾公开承认：“南朝鲜政府要联合国释放‘倾向民主’的平民以补充南朝鲜的人力”。美国侵略者的这种罪恶用心，不是早已暴露无遗了吗？
    显然，美国侵略者这种不计后果的犯罪企图，将使因遣俘问题而陷入僵局的朝鲜停战谈判又遭遇到一个新的障碍。美国侵略者必须立即放弃他们的这种企图，否则他们就必须对由此而造成的一切后果担负全部责任，并将受到朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民加倍严厉的惩罚。
