    Korean labor model Zhu Baoyu wrote an open letter to Chinese worker brothers and sisters on the eve of the second anniversary of the "June 25th" Korean People's Liberation War. Zhu Baoyu, a female worker at the Pyongyang Textile Factory and a labor model, recently invited to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" celebrations as a member of the Korean trade union delegation, reported on her situation after returning to her country, described the deep love and friendship of the Korean people for the Chinese people, and expressed the determination of Korean workers to further develop the production increase struggle to support the front and strike at US imperialism. The letter said:
    Dear Chinese worker brothers and sisters: First, please allow me to shake hands with you warmly! Meeting you in the May sunshine feels like just yesterday. However, it has been more than a month. During this time, I believe that you must have established more glorious achievements in your glorious creative labor. During my nearly one-month visit to and tour of great People's China, the solemn situation of the Chinese brothers and sisters' struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea that I saw and heard, and the warm welcome from many seniors and comrades, brought me to tears of emotion and increased my infinite courage. I will never forget those moving facts. In particular, the heroic posture of the Chinese worker brothers and sisters establishing labor achievements under the great banner of Mao Zedong has become a lighthouse in my mind that will never be extinguished.
    I have already told all the workers in our factory in detail about everything I saw and heard in New China. They all listened to the heroic struggle of the Chinese comrades with great excitement. Their determination has become even stronger. We take you as an example and strive to make more contributions on the production front. The model workers of our factory, Jin Fushi, Jin Jingshun, Min Yunying, and all the comrades in the factory have been moved by your struggle achievements. In order to improve their skills so as to keep up with you, they are carrying out various production increase competitions such as the four hundred spindle movement and the eight hundred spindle movement.
    Our factory is deep underground, avoiding the crazy bombing of American aerial bandits, overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and greeting the "Day of Struggle Against US Imperialism" with practical actions of increasing production and supporting the front. In order to thank the World Federation of Trade Unions for its support, the workers in our factory, the people of the entire Korea, have united like one person and have risen up to launch a struggle to increase production and support the front.
    Shortly after I returned to my factory after parting with you, I was transferred from the winding workshop to the spinning workshop. Dear comrades! I would like to assure you that I will definitely use Comrade Hao Jianxiu's model operation method as my operation standard, and work with all the workers in our factory to strive to be an excellent spinning worker. I would like to assure you that in order to avenge our countless parents, brothers and sisters who were brutally murdered by the enemy, in order to demand blood debts from US imperialism, which turned our factories built with blood and sweat into ruins, and in order to restore our factories better, we must overfulfill our production quotas. I would like to encourage you together: Let us join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder, and make more heroic contributions on the production front in the common just struggle! I wish you more brilliant achievements and good health.

    朝鲜劳动模范朱宝玉
    在“六·二五”前夕写给我国工人的公开信
    最近曾应邀到北京参加“五一”节观礼的朝鲜工会代表团团员、劳动模范、平壤纺织工厂女工朱宝玉，在“六·二五”朝鲜人民解放战争二周年纪念前夕，写给中国工人兄弟姊妹们一封公开信，报告她回国后的情形，叙述朝鲜人民对中国人民的深切热爱和友情，并表示朝鲜工人进一步开展增产斗争支援前线以打击美帝国主义的决心。信中说：
    亲爱的中国工人兄弟姊妹们：首先请允许我和您们热烈地握手！在五月的太阳下和您们相识，仿佛就是昨天的事情。但是，不觉已经过去一个多月了。在这期间，我相信您们在光荣的创造性的劳动中，一定又建立了更光辉的功勋。在伟大的人民中国访问参观近一个月的期间，我所看到的和听到的中国兄弟姊妹们庄严的抗美援朝斗争情形和许多前辈、许多同志对我们的热情欢迎，使我落下了感动的热泪，也使我增加了无限的勇气。那些动人的事实，我永远也不会忘记。特别是中国工人兄弟姊妹们在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下建立劳动功勋的雄姿，已经成为我心目中永远不会熄灭的灯塔。
    我已经把我在新中国的一切所见所闻，详细地讲给我们全厂的工友们听了。他们都以十分兴奋的心情倾听了中国同志们的英勇斗争事迹。他们的决心都更加坚强了。我们以您们当成榜样，争取在生产战线上多多立功。我们工厂的模范工人金福实、金景顺、闵云英以及全厂同志都被您们的斗争业绩所感动，他们为了提高自己的技术，以便向您们看齐，正在进行着四百锭运动、八百锭运动等各种增产竞赛。
    我们的工厂在很深的地下，躲避着美国空中强盗的疯狂轰炸，克服着一切艰难困苦，正以顽强的增产支前的实际行动，迎接着“反对美帝国主义斗争日”。为了答谢世界工联的声援，我们工厂的工友，全朝鲜的人民，已经团结得像一个人似地奋起展开增加生产、支援前线的斗争。
    我在和您们分手回到自己的工厂之后不久，已经从卷纱车间调到细纱车间工作了。亲爱的同志们！我愿向您们保证，我一定要把郝建秀同志的模范操作法当做我的操作标准，和我们工厂的全体工友一起争取做一个优秀的细纱工。我愿向您们保证，为了给惨遭敌人屠杀的我们无数父母兄弟姐妹报仇，为了向把我们用血汗建立起来的工厂变成废墟的美帝国主义讨还血债，为了把我们的工厂更好地恢复起来，我们一定要超额完成我们的生产定额。我愿和您们共勉：让我们手携手，肩并肩，在共同的正义斗争中，更英勇地在生产战线上立功吧！祝您们获得更光辉的成就，并祝您们身体健康。
