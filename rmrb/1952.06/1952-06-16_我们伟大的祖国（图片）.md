    Our Great Motherland
    This year, the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm has had a bumper wheat harvest. The farm used the Stalin No. 6 tractor combine harvester manufactured in the Soviet Union this year to harvest wheat, which can harvest 20 to 25 mu of wheat per hour. This is a scene of machine harvesting, and many cadres from institutions and students have come to visit.
