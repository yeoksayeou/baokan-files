Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    Chinese Academy of Sciences Accepts Readers' Suggestions
    Improving Imbalanced Research Work
    Editor: The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on May 23 carried a letter from Comrade Chen Ling criticizing the imbalance in the research institutions and research work under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, hoping that we would improve it. This opinion is correct. In order to correct this imbalance, the Academy has done some work in this regard and is continuing its efforts. For example, the Institute of Metal Research and the Instrument Museum were planned last year, and the Northeast Branch, established this year, will also establish the Institute of Industrial Chemistry, the Institute of Industrial Inspection, and the Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Because the national industry is recovering, most of the industrial technicians have been absorbed into the enterprises, and it takes a certain amount of time to train new talents, so new industrial research institutions can only be established gradually in a planned way.
    Academic journals should be edited by academic societies organized by scientists in various fields. The recent preliminary adjustment of various academic journals by the Academy is based on our estimation of the quality and quantity of manuscripts that various academic societies can actually collect, and considering the actual needs and basic categories of science. For example, the "Acta Entomologica Sinica", "Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica", "Acta Microbiologica Sinica", and "Acta Physiologica Sinica" seem to be publications related to biology on the surface, but their content will inevitably involve many issues of agricultural production and health care. This adjustment is of course far from ideal. Under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, some natural science workers' societies have been established, and some are still in preparation. Regarding engineering science societies, except for the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society, they are all still in the preparation stage. We should contact the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies to speed up the preparations for engineering societies, so as to appropriately increase some engineering science journals to meet the needs of the large-scale economic construction that will be gradually carried out.

### 中国科学院接受读者建议  改进研究工作不平衡现象

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国科学院接受读者建议
    改进研究工作不平衡现象
    编辑同志：五月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载陈陵同志的来信，批评中国科学院所属研究机构及研究工作的不平衡现象，希望我们加以改进。这个意见是正确的。为纠正这种不平衡现象，科学院在这一方面已经做过一些工作，而且正在继续努力。例如去年筹设了金属研究所、仪器馆，今年成立的东北分院也将设立工业化学研究所、工业检验所、土木建筑研究所。由于国家工业正在恢复，工业技术人员多数被吸收进企业部门，培养新人才又需要一定的时间，所以新的工业研究机构只能有计划地逐步地建立起来。
    学报当由各门科学工作者组织的学会从事编辑。最近本院对各种学报进行的初步调整，是根据我们对各学会实际能够征集到的文稿的质和量的估计，再考虑到实际的需要和科学的基本类别而决定的。例如，“昆虫学报”、“植物分类学报”、“微生物学报”、“生理学报”等四种学报，在表面上看来，它们都是有关生物学报方面的刊物，但它们的内容，必然涉及许多农业生产以及保健医疗的问题。这次调整，当然离理想还很远。在中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会领导下，有些自然科学工作者的学会已经成立，有的还在筹备中。关于工程科学的学会，除机械工程学会外，都还在筹备阶段。我们当与中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会联系，加紧进行工程学会的筹备工作，以便适当地增加一些工程科学期刊，适应大规模经济建设即将逐步开展的需要。            中国科学院办公厅
