Interview with Japanese Representative Takara Tomi

    The reporter interviewed Mr. Takara Tomi, the Japanese representative attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. She is a member of the Japanese House of Councillors, participated in the International Economic Conference held in Moscow this April, and was also one of the Japanese representatives who signed the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in Beijing on June 1.

    She began by saying that as a Japanese woman, she would like to first talk about the strong will of Japanese women for peace and against war, which she is most familiar with. With a heavy heart, she said that the fate of Japanese women is very unfortunate. The sixty years of Japanese history have been filled with wars, and in these wars of aggression, the lives of Japanese women have been very painful. Their husbands and children died in battle. War brought them only pain, without any benefit. At the same time, in Japan, women are also oppressed by the feudal system, and this feudal system is colluding with war and the oppression of militarism. Japanese women are under double shackles. Therefore, from their painful and personal experiences, Japanese women realize that militarism is the greatest enemy of Japanese women. In the Second World War, the Japanese women suffered the most in Japan. Speaking of this, Takara Tomi sadly mentioned the fact that today there are three million more adult Japanese women with the right to vote than adult men in Japan. The reporters couldn't help but ask the reason for this. Takara Tomi said that this was calculated based on the statistics of the Japanese government. There are more women than men, mainly because the war caused women to lose their husbands and sons. This is a very painful thing for Japanese women. She went on to say that the Japanese women who have experienced the pain of war have a conscience, and they feel ashamed and angry about Japan's past aggression against China, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam and other places.

    She said that after Japan surrendered and the American army occupied Japan, the most painful people at the grassroots level in Japan were still women. Their houses were bombed and they had nowhere to live, so they had to live in air-raid shelters; food was very scarce, and they had nothing to eat, so they had to go to the countryside to buy sweet potatoes and carry them back home to fill their hunger. During the six years of American military occupation, the Japanese women who lived the most shameful and painful lives were also the Japanese women. Many young girls in rural and urban areas were forced by life to sell themselves to the American army. These people are the so-called "Panpan girls." In Japan, venereal diseases are more prevalent than before. No Japanese woman does not consider this kind of life to be a great shame. She also talked about the tragic life of Japanese women and the relationship with the San Francisco "Peace Treaty." She said that Japanese women are eager for Japan to gain independence as soon as possible and end this shameful life. However, this "conciliation" is completely contrary to the wishes of Japanese women. This "conciliation" deprived Japan of the opportunity for independence, the American army is still stationed in Japan, and those poor "Panpan girls" are still "Panpan girls" today. Japanese women can clearly see from this that Japan is not independent. The "Panpan girls" themselves also said that only when Japan is independent can they end this painful and shameful life.

    Takara Tomi continued: However, the awareness of Japanese women has been raised. They strongly demand peace and oppose war. They said: They will no longer be deceived by the imperialists. Some reactionary members of parliament deceive them by saying that increasing taxes and rearming are for "defense" and for "peace." However, Japanese women today are very sensitive to who is really talking about peace. Takara Tomi said that once, when she exposed the hypocrisy of these members of parliament at a rally, the women present responded with warm applause.

    Speaking of this preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, Takara Tomi said: Representatives from twenty countries gathered together, and some representatives even came from far away South America, which made her deeply feel the grandness and enthusiasm of this meeting. She said that the population of the countries in the Asian and Pacific region accounts for two-thirds of the world's population, and establishing peace in this vast region is a great task. She said, "Seeing the great achievements China has made in just over two years and seeing the strength of the forces of peace, I believe that the future Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be successful."

    Takara Tomi expressed her views on another question raised by the reporter, namely, how should the people of China and Japan strengthen cultural exchanges in order to enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples. Takara Tomi said: She saw that films such as the "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" and the May Day documentary of the new China could be shown in Japan. Speaking of this, she incidentally mentioned the so-called "treaty" signed between the Kuomintang of Taiwan and the Japanese government on April 28. In Japan, no one with a mind agrees with this thing.

    When the topic turned to the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, Takara Tomi used many facts to illustrate the importance of the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade to the economic life of the Japanese people. She said that there are now 84 million people living on the four islands of Japan. On these four islands, the arable land area is only 17 percent, which can only support 45 percent of the population. The other 55 percent of the population can only rely on other sources to survive. The lives of the Japanese people are now extremely difficult. The most serious problem is the food problem. The price of food has risen to 435 percent of what it was before the war. According to Japanese government statistics, the average daily food intake of a Japanese man should have 2,500 calories of heat. But in reality, in 1951, it was only 1,089 calories.

    Takara Tomi went on to talk about the difficult living conditions of the general Japanese people. She gave an example: In Japan, a civil servant family of four (husband and wife, two children) has a monthly income of only 10,000 yen (approximately 30 US dollars). The rent for a room to live in probably accounts for 30 percent of the total income, and sometimes even 50 percent. In addition, taxes must be paid. Therefore, ordinary civil servants have to do some extra work after work to maintain the family's life.

    She also said that there are many unemployed people in Japan now. The government's published unemployment figure is more than 400,000 people. In fact, the number of unemployed people is far more than this. The trend of business closures is also becoming more and more serious. From January to March this year, 39 textile companies in Japan went bankrupt. These 39 companies are still in debt of 1.4 billion yen and cannot be cleared. Speaking of this, Takara Tomi excitedly said repeatedly: "Sino-Japanese trade is a great gospel for the Japanese people! It is a great gospel for the Japanese people!"

    The reporter asked her, what difficulties might there be on the Japanese side in implementing the Sino-Japanese trade agreement? She said: There are difficulties. The Americans are using the "Battle Act" to prohibit legitimate trade between China and Japan. They do not allow the Japanese to eat Chinese food, saying that Chinese food is poisonous and will cause revolution if eaten. However, she said, the "Battle Act" is an American law and was imposed on Japan by them. Now, they have no reason to restrain Japan from complying with this law.

    She emphasized: Trading with China is the urgent demand of the Japanese people, and this is a matter of survival for 84 million people. Without trade with China, Japan cannot survive. No matter how some people object, the fact is that it must be so.

    Takara Tomi continued to talk about the impact of the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade on Japan's economic life. She said that it is estimated that the UK signed a trade contract of 10 million pounds with China, which can provide jobs for 100,000 people in the UK. This Sino-Japanese trade agreement stipulates that both parties will purchase and sell 30 million pounds each this year. If based on the British standard, it can provide jobs for 300,000 unemployed workers in Japan. However, because the standard of living in Japan is lower than that in the UK, and the trade is larger, it is possible that ten times this number of people will get jobs. This means that the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement may provide jobs for 3 million unemployed workers in Japan. A large number of small and medium-sized enterprises will also be prevented from going bankrupt and closing down as a result. From here, we can see the importance of Sino-Japanese trade to Japan's economic life. She said that this is a living and realistic issue, and it is the will of the Japanese people, and the will of the people cannot be stopped. Therefore, she expressed: She has full confidence in the restoration and development of Sino-Japanese trade. After returning to her country, she will continue to work for this.

    Finally, Mr. Takara Tomi talked about her impression of New China. She said that what impressed her the most was that the people of New China were living a happy life. Everyone is very happy. She expressed envy for the fact that Chinese farmers can work on their own land and harvest abundant grain after the land reform. She said that the lives of Japanese farmers are very hard. They have no land. On average, seven people have only half a cho (approximately 7.5 Chinese acres) of land, and some do not even have that much. She mentioned China's Huai River project, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the "Great Green Wall" being planted, and so on. She said that the Chinese people have not only been mobilized in terms of material strength, but also in terms of spiritual and moral strength. She talked about how she herself used to think that countries led by the Communist Party only valued material things and did not value spiritual things. But after visiting the Soviet Union and China this time, this view has completely changed. She said: The Communist Party not only values material life, but also values spiritual life very much. In New China, I have seen the emergence of a new morality. She expressed her admiration and interest in the large-scale literacy campaign and self-reform study movement launched by the Chinese people. Secondly, she said, what impressed her the most was that China and the Soviet Union are both carrying out large-scale peaceful construction, striving to improve the people's lives. She said: She herself has lived in a society under militarist rule for decades, so she is very sensitive to the face of militarist society. She went on to say, but whether in the Soviet Union or China, there is a peaceful scene everywhere. She expressed that she has personally seen the spirit and will of the Chinese and Soviet people to love peace, and after returning to her country, she will convey what she has seen to the Japanese people.

    访日本代表高良富
    记者访问了出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的日本代表高良富先生。她是日本国会参议院议员，参加了今年四月在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议，也是六月一日在北京签订中日贸易协议的日方代表之一。
    她首先说，作为一个日本妇女，她愿意首先谈谈她最熟悉的关于日本妇女要求和平与反对战争的强烈意志。她带着沉重的心情说，日本妇女的命运是很不幸的。六十年来日本的历史，充满着战争，而在这些侵略战争中，日本妇女的生活是非常痛苦的。她们的丈夫、儿女战死了。战争带给她们的只是痛苦，没有任何好处。同时，在日本，妇女还受到封建制度的压迫，而这种封建制度是和战争，和军国主义的压迫勾结在一起的。日本妇女是处在双重的枷锁之下。因此，日本妇女从她们痛苦的、切身的经验中体会到：军国主义是日本妇女最大的敌人。在第二次世界大战中，在日本国内，受苦最深的是日本妇女。谈到这里，高良富以悲痛的心情提起今天日本国内有选举权的日本成年妇女比成年男人多三百万的事实。记者们不由得问起这个原因。高良富说，这是根据日本政府的统计数字算出来的。女人比男人多，主要是由于战争使妇女们失去了自己的丈夫和儿子。这对日本妇女是一件非常痛苦的事情。她接着说，经过了战争的痛苦的日本妇女是有良心的，她们对过去日本之侵略中国、菲律宾、马来亚、缅甸、印尼、越南等地，感到耻辱，感到愤怒。
    她说，在日本投降，美国军队占领日本后，日本基层人民中生活最痛苦的仍然是妇女。她们的房屋被炸毁了，没处住，不得不住在防空洞里；粮食十分困难，没吃的，不得不到乡下去买白薯，背回家里来充饥。在美国军队的六年多占领中，过着最耻辱、最痛苦生活的，也是日本妇女。许多农村和都市的少女，为生活所迫，不得不卖身给美国军队。这种人就是所谓“??女郎”。在日本，花柳病是比从前更多了。对于这种生活，日本妇女没有人不认为这是莫大的耻辱。她还谈到了日本妇女的悲惨生活和旧金山“和约”的关系。她说，日本妇女都热望日本早日获得独立，早日结束这种耻辱的生活。但是这次“媾和”是完全违背日本妇女的愿望的。这“媾和”剥夺了日本独立的机会，美军仍然驻在日本，那些可怜的“??女郎”们今天仍然是“??女郎”。日本妇女从这里很明显地看出日本并没有独立。“??女郎”们自己也说，只有日本独立了，才能结束这种痛苦的耻辱的生活。
    高良富接着说：但是，日本妇女的觉悟是提高了。她们强烈地要求和平，反对战争。她们表示：她们再也不受帝国主义者的欺骗了。有些反动议员欺骗她们说，增税和再军备是为了“防御”，为了“和平”。但是，日本妇女今天对于谁嘴里讲的和平是真正的，是很敏锐的。高良富说，有一次，她在一次集会上揭穿这些议员的虚伪的话时，到会的妇女均报以热烈的鼓掌。
    在谈到这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议时，高良富说：二十个国家的代表聚首一堂，有的代表还是来自遥远的南美洲，使她深深感到这次会议的盛大和热烈。她说，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人口占世界人口的三分之二，在这个广大地区上建立和平，是一个伟大的任务。她说，我在看到中国在两年多的短短时间中获得的如此伟大的成绩，看到和平力量如此强大，我相信未来的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，一定能得到成功。
    高良富对于记者提出的另一个问题，即为了增进中日两国人民之间的了解，中日两国人民应如何加强文化交流的问题。高良富表示：她看到，新中国“中国民族大团结”以及五一节纪录片之类的电影是可以在日本演出的。说到这里，她顺便提起四月二十八日台湾国民党和日本政府签订的所谓“和约”，在日本，没有一个有思想的人，赞成这个东西。
    当话题转到中日贸易问题时，高良富用许多事实，说明中日贸易的恢复，对于日本人民经济生活生死攸关的重要性。她说，日本四岛现在居住着八千四百万人口。在这四个岛上，可耕地面积只有百分之十七，只能供养百分之四十五的人口。其他百分之五十五的人口，就只有依靠别的来源来生存。日本人民的生活，现在真是困苦之至。最严重的问题就是粮食问题。粮食的价格已经上涨到战争前的百分之四百三十五。根据日本政府的统计，日本一个男子每日食量平均要有二千五百卡路里的发热量。但在实际上，在一九五一年，才只有一○八九卡。
    高良富接着谈到日本一般人民生活困苦的情况。她举例说：在日本，一个四口之家（夫妻二人，小孩两个）的公务员家庭，每月收入只有一万日元（约合三十块美元）。住一间房子的房租，大概要占去全部收入的百分之三十，有时占到百分之五十。此外，还要纳税。所以，一般公务员在工作之余，都还要做些额外劳动，来维持一家的生活。
    她又说，日本现在失业的很多。政府公布的失业数字是四十万多人。实际上，失业的人绝不止此。企业倒闭的趋势，也是越来越严重了。从今年一月到三月，日本就有三十九家纺织公司倒闭。这三十九家现在还负债十四亿日元，无法清理。讲到这里，高良富激动地连声说：“中日贸易是日本人民很大的福音！是日本人民很大的福音！”
    记者问她，实现中日贸易协议在日本方面可能有什么困难吗？她说：困难是有的。美国人利用“巴特尔法”禁止中日之间进行正当贸易。他们不许日本人吃中国粮食，说中国粮食有毒，吃了会闹革命的。但是，她说，“巴特尔法”是美国的法律，是他们强加于日本的。现在，他们再也没有理由来约束日本遵守这个法律了。
    她强调地说：与中国进行贸易，是日本人民的迫切要求，这是八千四百万人的生存问题。不与中国贸易，日本就不能生存。不管有些人如何反对，但事实是必须如此。
    高良富继续谈到了中日贸易的恢复，对于日本经济生活的影响。她说，据估计，英国和中国订了一千万镑的贸易合同，可以使英国有十万人得到职业。这次中日贸易协议规定双方在今年购进和售出各三千万镑，如果按照英国的标准，可使日本三十万失业工人，得到职业。但是，由于日本生活程度比英国低，而且贸易更大，因此可能有十倍于此的人数，得到职业。这就说，中日贸易协议的实现，可能使日本有三百万失业工人得到职业。大批中小企业，也将因此不致于破产和倒闭。从这里，可以看到中日贸易对日本经济生活的重要了。她说这是活生生的现实问题，是日本大众的意志，而大众的意志是不可阻止的。因此，她表示：她对中日贸易的恢复和发展，具有充分的信心。她在回国之后，将为这个工作而继续努力。
    最后，高良富先生谈到了他对新中国的印象，她说，她印象最深的是新中国的人民在过着幸福的生活。每个人都很愉快。她对中国农民在土地改革后能在他们自己土地上劳动，收获丰富的粮食一点，表示羡慕。她说，日本农民的生活很苦，没有土地，平均七个人才有半町（约合七点五华亩）土地，有的还没有这么多。她提到了中国的治淮工程、成渝铁路、正在植造中的“森林长城”等等。她说，中国人民不但在物质力量上发动起来了，而且精神和道德的力量，也发动起来了。她谈到她自己过去一直认为共产党领导的国家只是看重物质方面的东西，而不看重精神方面的东西。但是这一次参观了苏联和中国以后，这种看法完全改变过来了。她说：共产党不仅是看重物质生活，对精神生活也是很看重的。在新中国，我已经看到产生了一种新道德。她对中国人民大规模展开的识字运动、自我改造的学习运动，表示很钦佩，很感兴趣。其次，她说，她印象最深的，是中苏两国都在进行大规模的和平建设，为改善人民的生活而努力。她说：她自己在军国主义统治下的社会里生活了几十年，因此，对军国主义社会的面貌是很敏感的，她接着说，但到了苏联也好，中国也好，到处是一片和平景象。她表示，她已亲自看到了中苏两国人民爱好和平的精神和意志，她在回国之后，将把她所看到的情形，传达给日本人民。
