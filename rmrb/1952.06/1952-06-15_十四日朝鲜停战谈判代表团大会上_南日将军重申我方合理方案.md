Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th: At the plenary session of the Korean Armistice Negotiation delegations today, our chief delegate, General Nam Il, pointed out that the other side cannot deny that their proposal directly violates the Geneva Convention, and cannot deny that they have never made any concessions on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. They once again put forward the old tune of so-called "neutral and joint re-screening" to defend their one-sided and unreasonable proposal. Screening prisoners of war is a fundamental violation of the Geneva Convention. The other side's repeated proposal of the illegal claim of "neutral and joint re-screening" only shows their determination to block the door to a negotiated solution on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. General Nam Il emphasized that our plan for returning prisoners of war to their homes is a realistic plan that can truly solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and suggested that the other side reconsider their position carefully.

General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

"The issue of prisoner of war repatriation should not have become an issue in the first place, because the Geneva Convention and all principles of international law clearly stipulate that all prisoners of war must be repatriated after the armistice. If your side had complied with this provision, the armistice negotiations would have reached an agreement long ago. It is only because your side insists on the one-sided and unreasonable proposal of April 28th and refuses to negotiate that the negotiations have reached the current stalemate. Therefore, the responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side.

Your side repeatedly says that your proposal is 'fair' and 'humane.' Is it unfair for the belligerent parties to immediately repatriate the prisoners of war they have captured after the armistice? Is it fair that your side detains our captured personnel? Is it inhumane to repatriate all prisoners of war after the armistice so that they can immediately return home to live a peaceful life, while it is humane to detain prisoners of war so that they cannot return home to live a peaceful life? Are all historical precedents for the repatriation of prisoners of war after wars unfair and inhumane? Is the 1949 Geneva Convention, which your fifteen countries signed, also unfair and inhumane? In order to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis and ensure that prisoners of war on both sides can immediately return home to live a peaceful life and no longer participate in the Korean War, our side specifically proposes that all foreign armed personnel captured by both sides, i.e., United Nations forces or captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, be repatriated to their homes; all Korean armed personnel captured by both sides, i.e., South Korean soldiers or captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, whose homes are in the area belonging to one side, be repatriated to their homes; and those whose homes are in the area of the capturing side may be allowed to return home without repatriation. Our proposal is fully in line with the spirit of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Our proposal is a fair compromise for both sides. From any point of view, our proposal is a realistic plan that can truly solve the issue of prisoner of war repatriation.

The issue of prisoner of war repatriation must be resolved on the basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention. In order to achieve an armistice in Korea, our side has made many major efforts and put forward a truly fair and reasonable proposal. This proposal is the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. For the sake of the armistice in Korea and for the benefit of prisoners of war on both sides, I suggest that your side carefully reconsider your position."

### 十四日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上  南日将军重申我方合理方案

    十四日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    南日将军重申我方合理方案
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出对方不能否认对方方案直接违反了日内瓦公约，不能否认对方在战俘遣返问题上，从来没有作过任何让步，却再次提出所谓“中立与联合再甄别”的老调，以为其片面无理方案辩护。对战俘进行甄别是根本违反日内瓦公约的。对方一再提出“中立与联合再甄别”的非法主张只是表示对方决心杜塞协商解决战俘遣返问题之门。南日将军强调指出我方遣返战俘回家的方案是真正足以解决战俘遣返问题的切合实际的方案，建议对方重新慎重考虑对方的立场。
    南日将军的主要发言如下：
    “战俘遣返问题本来是不应该成为问题的，因为日内瓦公约和一切国际法原则都明确地规定在停战后必须遣返全部战俘。假使你方遵守这一规定，停战谈判早已达成协议；仅仅是因为你方坚持那片面无理的四月二十八日的方案，拒绝协商，谈判才陷入今天这样的局面，因此拖延谈判的责任完全在于你方。
    你方一再说你们的方案是‘公平的’、‘人道的’。难道说交战双方在停战后立即遣返它所收容下的战俘竟是不公平的，而你方扣留我方被俘人员却反而是公平的吗？难道说在停战后遣返全体战俘使他们能够立即回家过和平生活是不人道的，而扣留战俘使他们不能回家过和平生活却是人道的吗？难道历史上一切战后遣返战俘的先例都是不公平不人道的？难道你们十五个国家签字于其上的一九四九年日内瓦公约也是不公平不人道的？为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，保证双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活，不再参加朝鲜战争，我方具体建议双方所俘获的外国武装人员即联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员全部遣返回家，双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员即南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军被俘人员其家在原属一方地区者全部遣返回家，其家在收容一方地区者得许其回家，不必遣返。我方方案完全符合于一九四九年日内瓦公约的精神。我方方案是对双方公平的折衷方案。不论从任何一个角度来看，我方方案是真正足以解决战俘遣返问题的切合实际的方案。
    战俘遣返问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的基础上求得解决。为实现朝鲜停战，我方已经作了多次重大努力，提出了一个真正公平合理方案。这方案是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。为了朝鲜的停战，为了双方战俘的利益，我建议你方重新慎重考虑你方的立场。”
