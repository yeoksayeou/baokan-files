    Striving to Uphold the Michurin Direction in Biological Science

    Editor's Note: The Chinese Communist Party Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discussed the errors committed by Comrade Le Tianyu, the former director of the Genetics and Breeding Experimental Station of the Academy, in April of this year. The Branch Congress considered that the nature of this error belonged to serious lack of organization and discipline, a serious academic-tyrant style of being detached from the masses, and serious non-Marxist tendencies in academic work. In order to further criticize Comrade Le Tianyu's errors in biological science work, the Science and Health Department of the Planning Bureau of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, together with the Planning Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, convened three symposiums on biological science work between April and June of this year. They also discussed the current state of biological science and some of the issues within it, and exchanged preliminary views on future work. Participants in these three symposiums included Zhu Kezhen (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Zhao Feng, Meng Qingzhe, He Zuoxiu (Planning Bureau of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council), Geng Guangbo, Chen Ren (Central Ministry of Agriculture), Zhang Jingyue, Liu Ciyuan (Peking University), Zhou Jiachi, Jiang Bingquan, Zhu Zhensheng (Beijing Agricultural University), Chen Fengtong, Zu Deming (North China Agricultural Science Research Institute), Qian Chongshu, Wu Zhengyi (Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Plant Taxonomy), Le Tianyu, Xu Weiying, Liang ZhengLan, Hu Han (Chinese Academy of Sciences Genetics and Breeding Experimental Station), Li Jianwu (Tsinghua University), Jin Chengzong (Chinese Academy of Sciences Plant Physiology Research Laboratory), Huang Zuojie, Sun Jizhong (Chinese Academy of Sciences Darwinism Research Class), Yun Ziqiang, Ding Zan, Wang Zhihua, He Chengjun, Jian Zhuopo (Chinese Academy of Sciences Compilation Bureau and Planning Bureau) and others. This article is a conclusion of the first two symposiums. At the last symposium, the above-mentioned attendees basically agreed with the arguments in this article. The various tasks listed at the end are only preliminary ideas and need to be discussed more deeply. Regarding the current state of biological science, especially the influence of Morganism on old biology and old genetics, a systematic critique needs to be continued.

    I. Michurin Biological Science is a great achievement of consciously and thoroughly applying Marxism-Leninism to biological science.

    Michurin Biological Science is a fundamental revolution in biological science. It uses dialectical materialism as its philosophical foundation, proving the dialectical process of biological development. By mastering the laws of biological development, it has developed biological science to a completely new and higher stage.

    Before Michurin, biological science was only a "contemplative" and "descriptive" science. The revolutionary nature of Michurin Biological Science lies first in its practicality, in that it not only seeks to understand the biological world but also to transform it. Precisely because it reveals the direction, laws, factors, and driving forces of this biological development process, it can act on the laboring people to change and transform the biological world and build the cause of communism.

    First, Michurin Biological Science affirms that the decisive factor in biological development lies in the unity of organic matter and the environment. Starting from this proposition, it reaches the conclusion that organisms create themselves from external environmental conditions and also change themselves from here. The so-called "species are permanently immutable" is merely the theoretical basis for the fascist racist's "human eugenics plan."

    Based on a correct understanding of the relationship between organisms and the environment, Soviet biologists have transformed agricultural biology, destroyed the pseudo-scientific "laws" such as the "law of diminishing returns on fertile land," the "limits of harvests," and the "excess of organisms in nature," and strived for an unprecedented increase in agricultural production.

    Second, Michurin Biological Science affirms the connection and inter-dependence of the biological world, that is, the connection and dependence of the same species and various species in their common survival and competition and struggle for survival, that is, no struggle and mutual assistance within a biological species, and the connection and dependence of mutual assistance and struggle between species. Starting from this dialectical proposition, it reaches the conclusion that there is no struggle between individuals of the same species, and even if abnormal individuals of the same species suffer disasters due to competition for living conditions, it is by no means the driving force and foundation of species development. It exposes the pseudo-science that believes that struggle between individuals of the same species and natural selection are the basic factors of biological evolution. It is only finding a basis for the bourgeoisie's concocted theories of "overpopulation" and "insufficient living resources," and justifying the poverty of the laboring people under capitalist conditions.

    Based on a correct understanding of the inter-dependence of organisms, Soviet biologists have examined the relationships between the same species and various species, recognized the struggles and mutual assistance between various organisms; promoted crop rotation, improved soil, and built windbreaks in agriculture... establishing a correct theoretical basis for plans to transform nature.

    Third, Michurin Biological Science correctly recognizes the unity of the internal organism – the dialectical unity of parts and the whole. Starting from this dialectical proposition, it reaches the conclusion that heredity depends on the organism, that a certain heredity forms together with the organism and changes together with the organism. It exposes the pseudo-science of the Morgan's [Note 1] and others' chromosomal inheritance theory that opposes parts and the whole. The Morgan's generation believes that the mysterious "genes of heredity" are immortal, which is completely a concoction. All life on earth originates from inanimate matter, and we must not use the theological belief that supernatural powers create life to explain the origin and formation of life.

    Fourth, Michurin Biological Science observes the biological life process of assimilation and dissimilation, metabolism, creation and destruction, continuous innovation and change, and the transition from quantitative change to qualitative change, starting from the dialectical proposition that the struggle of internal opposites is the driving force of biological development. It created methods to strengthen the internal contradictions within the organism, making it transform and adapt to new conditions to cultivate new species, thereby achieving great achievements in agricultural production and animal husbandry.

    Michurin Biological Science recognizes the regularity of biological development in revealing the dialectical connection between organisms and the environment, between organisms, and between parts and the whole of the organism. The way that Mendel [Note 2] and Weismann [Note 3] describe biological development as a completely accidental combination of various chromosomes disarms science completely before the great task of transforming and harnessing nature.

    II. Michurin Biological Science is not a "department" in biology, but a fundamental change in biological science.

    Michurin Biological Science completely changed the face of biological science. Guided by Michurin Biological Science, Soviet biologists have achieved great achievements in all aspects of biological science. Pavlov revealed the fact that the psychological and physiological functions of organisms are interdependent and influence each other; Lepashinskaya successfully proved that the formation of new cells is not only through the reproduction of cells themselves but also directly from non-cellular matter; Boshyan [Note 4] determined that microorganisms and viruses are different stages of development of the same organism, that filterable viruses can be transformed into microbial forms, and microorganisms can also be transformed into viruses... All these illustrate how enlightening Michurin Biological Science is to all departments of biological science, proving that Michurin Biological Science is by no means a "department" in biological science, but a fundamental change in biological science.

    Michurin Biological Science has been introduced to our country for several years, and relevant works have been translated. Many biologists and young students are learning Michurin Biological Science with great enthusiasm; many schools and research institutions are reforming courses and research work based on Michurin's theory. However, some biologists in our country do not seem to have faced this fact squarely, and some biologists even take an opposing attitude towards Michurin Biological Science, saying that "Michurin's untenable theory is only some rough and superficial observations, and does not understand what is called heredity at all." This view is not worth refuting. If we regard the practice of Michurin and Lysenko in improving fruit trees and crops as rough observations, then is the Morganists' experiment of breeding fruit flies in feeding bottles and cutting off rat tails, which is divorced from practice, considered "as accurate and reliable as mathematics"? Some people take a way of avoiding talking about it, saying "I don't consider this question at all," or saying "Everyone has a different definition of heredity." These people regard heredity as: organisms have so-called germ plasm and body plasm, the germ plasm is eternally immutable, and is inherited by offspring through "genes." So they did some ridiculous experiments: cutting off rat tails with a knife, and after several generations of removal, the offspring still have tails. This is their eternally unchanging definition of "heredity." Many people also believe that Michurin Biological Science is "one family's saying" and do not add or deny it. The various departments of biological science in universities are basically untouched, the views of old biology still run through all aspects of the curriculum, and Michurin Biological Science is just a "semester course." More seriously, on the one hand, they admit the genetics of the Mendel's generation, and on the other hand, they say that Lysenko created new ideas and overturned old ones. In secondary school biology textbooks, Michurin Biological Science only occupies one chapter; when talking about the research methods of biological science, the role of guiding ideology in scientific work is not properly explained at all, and "using thought to study problems" is opposed to the so-called scientific observation and experimental methods.

    In practical work, some agricultural science institutions still place the main work on breeding for disease resistance, and the method of pure-line breeding [Note 5] is still the basic method, and the pure-line theory is still the basic guiding theory.

    The so-called pure breed, natural history of development has long proved that the pure line is a myth that will not exist. Even Darwin unconsciously revealed the fact that organisms accumulate subtle quantitative changes in the process of species development, and that they transform to fundamental qualitative changes. As Lysenko pointed out in "Stalin and Michurin Biological Science": "Darwin's immortal work scientifically proved that the organic world is constantly changing and developing, it has its own history, its own past, present and future. Darwin's great achievement lies in proving that the organic world is developing on the basis of natural laws." Because pure lines do not exist at all, pure-line breeding has to, like Morganists, build so-called science on accidental encounters, resorting to statistics and luck. The "pure-line route" built on accidental luck puts all hope on accidental encounters in the work, that is, carrying out blind and accidental selection in order to find some "homogeneous gene combination." In addition to causing waste of capital and manpower, this will only lead to the degradation and destruction of varieties. Michurin had long said: "The life of the entire natural world is not stagnant in its own form, it is constantly moving forward, constantly changing, and all forms of organisms, if they stop their development for some reason, are inevitably doomed to be eliminated." (See Michurin's Complete Works, Volume 1, page 629) But some of our agricultural scientists have not even accepted the basic viewpoints of dialectical materialism.

    Even if some people use new methods to do some work, such as grafting moonflowers and sweet potatoes, the experimental analysis does not follow the principles of Michurin. We can say that this is "Michurin's method, Morgan's principle." Other examples, such as the breeding of branched wheat, may be difficult to achieve the expected results in a short period of time due to the lack of broad materials, insufficient investigation, imprecise design, and insufficient estimation of the characteristics of branched wheat's weak variability.

    The greatness of Michurin Biological Science lies in its thorough service to improving agricultural production and transforming nature. But this does not seem to have attracted the attention of our biologists. Our plant classification work is still unilaterally devoted to wild plants, and classification is for the sake of classification. It does not pay attention to the research on the distribution, yield, living habits, and economic value of plants, and therefore cannot closely connect with practical work. The research work in universities also often advocates doing some unpopular work in order to become famous. For example, students want to study the life history of bedbugs to eliminate bedbugs, but professors want students to study coelenterates. Students want to study the improvement of draft animal breeds, but professors want students to study liver glycogen changes in frogs. This makes the research work of schools divorced from practical life.

    The above situation shows that the current situation of biological science in our country has reached an intolerable point. If this continues, "biological science serving the cause of national construction" will only be empty talk. Seriously and systematically studying Michurin Biological Science is an urgent need for the biological community in our country.

    III. Narrow empiricism and a view that belittles theory, turning Michurin Biological Science into a boring dogma, also hinders the development of Michurin Biological Science in our country.

    Michurin Biological Science starts from the idea that biological science serves agricultural practice, and creates a complete scientific theoretical system about the discussion of biology and management of biology, and applies it to the agricultural practice of transforming nature and benefiting the people. The greatness of Michurin Biological Science lies in its service to the communist construction of transforming nature, and at the same time, theoretically destroying the pseudo-science that defends the capitalist exploitation system, and finding a scientific theoretical basis for the communist construction of transforming nature. The consistency of theory and practice is one of the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, and any bias will inevitably lead to wrong conclusions.

    In our country's work of introducing, publicizing, studying, and researching Michurin Biological Science, there has been a tendency towards empiricism and dogmatism, and the main representative of this tendency is Comrade Le Tianyu. Comrade Le Tianyu has had many achievements in the past, such as promoting the planting of sugar beets during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War; establishing veterinary stations in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region; and training some agricultural technical cadres; he was able to overcome difficulties in a harsh environment and initially promoted Michurin Biological Science, and had some achievements. However, Comrade Le Tianyu also made quite serious mistakes and shortcomings in his work, the most important of which is the tendency of empiricism and dogmatism.

    This tendency is first manifested in attaching importance to scattered production experience and neglecting systematic agricultural theory; emphasizing learning from production and negating laboratory work; thinking that "the farm is the laboratory, and nature is the classroom." We believe that it is wrong to oppose and separate rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge, emphasizing one aspect and neglecting the other. We oppose the dogmatic tendency of being divorced from reality, and we also oppose the empirical tendency of neglecting theory. This empirical tendency of belittling theory is essentially non-Marxist-Leninist.

    Under the dominance of this thinking, Comrade Le Tianyu made serious mistakes, saying that "We solve problems under the 'microscope,' and the common people solve problems from cultivation. If the common people do not rely on the laws of nature to solve problems, they will starve to death. 'Scholars' have no living problems and can do it without relying on the laws of nature. The common people are materialists, and the scholars are idealists" (see the Journal of the Chinese Michurin Society, Volume 1, Issue 1, Le Tianyu's closing remarks). In order to overcome the situation that scientific work is divorced from practice, it is necessary to require scientists to connect theory with practice and for science to serve national agricultural construction. But we must never mistakenly and naively oppose theory and practice.

    Comrade Le Tianyu also said "These theories are very simple, ... I think that whether you are educated or not, even children can understand Michurin's science" (see the Journal of the Chinese Michurin Society, Volume 1, Issue 1, Le Tianyu's closing remarks). It is necessary to apply Michurin Biological Science to agricultural practice and to promote and popularize it to the masses. True scientific truth is often simple and easy to understand, but we must never belittle or reduce the significance of scientific work because of this. Because, Marxism-Leninism's view of science is that on the one hand, it admits that science is subordinate to social existence and is a reflection of social existence; but on the other hand, it also admits that science has a certain relative independence and the ability to actively and dynamically influence social existence.

    This erroneous leftist childish view completely negated traditional biological science. Comrade Le Tianyu's logic is: since species are always changing, plant taxonomy is naturally useless, and the study of diseases and insect pests is also useless, because we only need to cultivate varieties that are not afraid of diseases and are not susceptible to insect pests. The relationship between organisms and the environment is the basic content of Michurin's theory. Since we affirm Michurin Biological Science, how can we say that organisms will not be attacked by diseases, insects, etc.? Comrade Le Tianyu also takes a completely negative attitude towards knowledge such as biostatistics. Yes, the laws of biological development must never be replaced by the laws of mathematics, and we must oppose reducing the laws of the biological world to mathematical games. No one will admit that statistics is an omnipotent knowledge, but the useful parts of it can be sorted out and turned into a useful department in biological science.

    Secondly, Comrade Le Tianyu's other bias is not to regard Michurin Biological Science as a pointer to practice, but to use it as a scary talisman.

    Marxist-Leninists believe that only dialectical materialism is the only correct law to guide scientific practice, and they also advocate and encourage people to use the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to explain history and science. But dogmatists only forcibly use philosophical terms, using the general laws of materialist dialectics to replace some specific laws in biological science.

    The book "Essentials of Genetics and Breeding" written by Comrade Le Tianyu is basically copied from the works of Lysenko, Troshin, etc. The entire chapters are reversed and chaotic, making people confused. For example, on page 10 of the book, it says: "Without selection and proper cultivation, the animal and plant varieties created by agricultural practice will never appear. This is like we go to a shoe store to choose shoes. Just choosing the ones that look good and are the right length is not creation." These two sentences are copied from pages 424 and 423 of Lysenko's "Agricultural Biology." Because the order is copied upside down, it becomes contradictory. The previous sentence affirms that natural and artificial selection are the creation of agricultural practice, and the latter sentence says that natural and artificial selection only play a role in selection and cannot create new species. The metaphor of picking shoes is inherently inappropriate. Lysenko said this: "Selection is not the selection of dead and solidified objects, but the selection of plants and animals, that is, the selection of biological organisms, then the conclusion should be different. The biological organisms themselves or their offspring continue to live and therefore continue to change, and at the same time, they change in the direction that has already begun." This precisely illustrates that the old agronomists, they do not attempt to influence the regular process of biological development, nor do they create conditions for biological changes guided by human needs. Ultimately, it is a kind of accidental exploration, just like the metaphor of picking shoes. But what does Comrade Le Tianyu mean by copying these two sentences together? Is it to affirm that natural and artificial selection have creativity? Or are natural and artificial selection just picking shoes? This on the one hand shows Comrade Le Tianyu's carelessness, and it also shows that if Michurin Biological Science is only regarded as dogma, it will not only not be of any benefit to practical work, but will only cause confusion and cause losses to the work.

    The tendency of dogmatism is even more manifested in the far-fetched application of philosophical terms. For example, it says "Contradictions must require unity in order to survive, and this unity causes the movement of matter, which generates the driving force of biological development" (see "Essentials of Genetics and Breeding," page 20). We know that the struggle of internal opposites is the driving force of biological development. This is a proposition of Marxism-Leninism, but the saying that "the unity of contradictions generates the driving force of biological development" is undoubtedly a common-sense error. Can we confuse the struggle of opposites with the unity of contradictions?

    Michurin Biological Science believes that biological development is a process of transition from quantitative change to fundamental qualitative change. But Comrade Le Tianyu said "There are two different ways of qualitative change: First, from quantitative change to qualitative change, that is, qualitative change occurs when quantitative change reaches a certain level. We call this method the improvement method. Second, biological changes caused by different living conditions during the development stage. We call this method the revolution method" (see "Essentials of Genetics and Breeding," page 27). Here we simply don't know what is being said, because we cannot say that natural variations are improvement methods, and artificial variations are revolution methods; nor can we say that the gradual accumulation process of quantitative change is an improvement method, and the leap qualitative change process is a revolution method. Comrade Stalin said in "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism": "Dialectics does not regard the development process as a simple growth process, as a process in which numerical changes do not cause qualitative changes, but as a development process from unobtrusive small numerical changes to conspicuous changes, to fundamental changes, to qualitative changes. In this process, qualitative changes do not occur gradually, but occur rapidly and suddenly, that is, manifested in the sudden change from one state to another, which does not occur accidentally, but occurs regularly, that is, it is the result caused by the accumulation of many inconspicuous gradual numerical changes." Obviously, Marxism-Leninism believes that the development of all objects and forms of movement of matter inherently contains two kinds of changes, namely evolutionary and revolutionary, the gradual accumulation process of numerical change and the qualitative change of leaping development into a new quality. There are no two kinds of qualitative changes, such as the qualitative change of the improvement method and the qualitative change of the revolution method as Comrade Le Tianyu understands it. No wonder the masses said that Comrade Le Tianyu's explanation of Michurin Biological Science is really "seemingly right but actually wrong, unknowable," "neither crying nor laughing, the more you listen, the more confused you become."

    IV. Comrade Le Tianyu's arbitrary unscientific attitude and bad academic-tyrant style caused great losses to the country's scientific cause.

    Marxist-Leninists should be the most scientific people. Because the characteristic of Marxism-Leninism lies first in its practicality and combativeness. It is not empty talk, but starts from facts in everything. Chairman Mao taught us that Marxist-Leninists must seek truth from facts. Since Marxism-Leninism is the truth that studies the internal connections, that is, the regularity, of objective things, Marxist-Leninists should be the most scientific people. Marxist-Leninist scientists should be even more so.

    However, Comrade Le Tianyu, as a Communist Party member, took an arbitrary and superficial unscientific attitude towards scientific work. He adopted this attitude when criticizing old genetics. We know that the "genes" fabricated in old genetics are naturally a concoction, and we should refute their falsehood with theory and practice. In this regard, Soviet biologists have long used facts to illustrate the falsity of this so-called law of gene purity; but Comrade Le Tianyu said arbitrarily in his paper "The Philosophical Foundation of Michurin Biological Science": "This gene has not only not been seen by anyone, but even Morgan himself has not seen it. He uses this false gene to affirm the biological inherited traits. This view is not true, it cannot be grasped, and it is a fantasy. Fantasy is idealism" (see Natural Science Lectures, Department of Biology, page 25). It is too insufficient to criticize a scientific hypothesis only with the reason of having seen it or not. For example, atoms and molecules are also invisible, but who can say that atoms and molecules do not exist?

    Marxist-Leninists must analyze specific problems based on specific materials and treat different problems with different attitudes. Therefore, there should be a distinction between handling academic problems and handling political problems. We cannot criticize old biologists as "idealistic," "reactionary," "serving the bourgeoisie," and "fascist" and be done with it. We should make it clear that the struggle between Morganism and Michurin Biological Science in biological science is the expression of two worldviews in science. It is an irreconcilable fundamental debate. Some parts of old biology have been proven to be pseudo-science, and some conclusions of old genetics are one of the theoretical foundations of fascism. Some old agronomy has been proven in practice to be "almost all bad" (Michurin). So it must be transformed. We can say that the ideology of old genetics is reactionary, but we cannot say that scholars who believe in old genetics must be politically reactionary elements. This is very clear. Therefore, we oppose using Michurin Biological Science as a stick to beat people with, and using Michurin Biological Science as a protective talisman to cover up our own ignorance. As Lenin pointed out: "If a communist, only based on the ready-made conclusions he has learned, but without a very serious, extremely arduous and vast effort, does not understand the actual things that he must treat with a critical attitude, and wants to brag about the word communism, then such communism is very sad." (See "The Tasks of the Youth League").

    Comrade Le Tianyu adopts a closed-door attitude towards the masses, does not rely on the majority to promote work, to the extent that the masses say that he is "occupying Michurin's theory." He himself does not study Michurin well, and also prevents others from studying Michurin. If someone raises opinions on his work, he says that it is opposing Michurin; if someone opposes his bad style, he says that the other party has political problems and ulterior motives. As everyone's criticism of Comrade Le Tianyu at the Chinese Communist Party Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: "He does not allow others to learn Michurin, because that is 'speculation,' and he does not allow others not to learn Michurin, because that is 'reactionary.'" It should be pointed out that this style is not in the slightest similar to the style of a Communist Party member. Lenin taught us: "The vanguard... unless it forms alliances with non-Communists in various activities, there is no way to talk about effective communist construction work." (See "On the Significance of Militant Materialism"). But Comrade Le Tianyu uses such an attitude to treat science, such a style to lead the country's scientific research work, and such an attitude to treat the masses, and naturally it will only cause major losses to the country's scientific cause.

    The ideological root cause of Comrade Le Tianyu's mistakes is mainly very strong personal heroism. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi described in his article "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "People with this kind of thinking first consider the level of their personal status in the Party. He likes to show off, likes others to flatter him and praise him. He has a desire for personal leadership. He is good at showing off his abilities, likes to take credit, likes to show himself, likes to take over, has no 'tolerance,' has a strong vanity, is unwilling to work hard, is unwilling to do technical work. He is proud. He is arrogant after a little success, overpowering others and not treating people equally, humbly, and kindly. He is complacent, likes to be a teacher, likes to teach others, and wants to climb on top of others, but is not commanded by others, does not learn humbly from others, especially not from the masses, and does not accept criticism from others. He can only 'rise' and cannot 'fall.' He can only be 'prosperous' and cannot be 'unlucky.' He cannot withstand blows and grievances, and he is not flexible in dealing with himself. He is not a 'great man who can bend and stretch.' His 'good name' has not been eliminated. He attempts to make himself a 'great man' and 'hero' in the cause of communism, and even does not choose means to satisfy this desire... In the minds of such people, the consciousness of the exploiting class remains, and they do not understand the greatness of communism and have no great communist mind." Comrade Le Tianyu's serious lack of organization and discipline, his academic-tyrant style of being divorced from the masses, and his serious non-Marxist tendencies in academic work have seriously affected the development and promotion of Michurin Biological Science in China. Therefore, criticizing this thinking is extremely necessary for us.

    V. Learn Michurin Biological Science in practical work, thoroughly transform all departments of biological science with Michurin Biological Science, and strive to uphold the Michurin direction in biological science.

    Michurin Biological Science has been introduced to China for two or three years. We must not let it remain in the introductory stage. How to combine Michurin Biological Science with China's agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, how to use Michurin Biological Science to criticize and transform the bourgeois reactionary pseudo-scientific viewpoints in old biology, and then transform all departments of biological science, how to establish basic research work and theoretical work, and how to promote agricultural technologies that have achieved effective results, all need us to solve. We put forward the following opinions, some of which may need to be discussed, and please discuss them:

    The biological community in our country should launch a widespread and in-depth learning movement to learn Michurin Biological Science.

    The most important thing in learning Michurin Biological Science is to learn its fundamentals, not its details. We know that Michurin Biological Science, in its essence, is the conscious and thorough application of Marxism-Leninism to biological science. Michurin Biological Science and old biology are the reflection and application of different worldviews and different methodologies in biological science. It is impossible to learn Michurin Biological Science correctly and completely without learning Marxism-Leninism. This is why some biologists only see Michurin's methods of grafting and breeding, and do not see that Michurin Biological Science is a fundamental revolution in biological science. We should first oppose this attitude of learning Michurin only with a simple technical point of view. More importantly, we must recognize that Michurin Biological Science is a fundamental revolution in biological science, correct the erroneous statement that "Michurin Biological Science is only a department in biology," introduce the achievements of the Soviet scientific community based on Michurin Biological Science in the development of protein synthesis research, life matter research, mutual transformation of microorganisms and viruses, etc., and thoroughly transform ecology, cytology, embryology, microbiology, etc., and other departments of biological science.

    We must learn Michurin Biological Science from the work of criticizing old biology and old genetics. The biology departments of universities should thoroughly reform all kinds of courses; we must seriously and thoroughly criticize the pure-line theory, and we must also criticize the harmful parts of biostatistics, ecology, and other departments.

    We must learn Michurin Biological Science from learning and mastering the methodology of Marxism-Leninism. For example, according to dialectical materialism, we believe: "If any phenomenon in nature is taken alone and regarded as a phenomenon that is not connected with its surrounding conditions, then it will be an incomprehensible thing, because any phenomenon in any part of nature, if it is regarded as a phenomenon that is not connected with its surrounding conditions and regarded as a phenomenon that is isolated from them, then it will be a meaningless thing." (See Stalin's "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism") These words have a very great enlightening significance for us to study Michurin Biological Science. For example, just in terms of the problem of agricultural abundance, many factors are interrelated. If we select good varieties, we must also have reasonable cultivation methods; and dense planting and fertilizers are closely related; if irrigation and fertilizers are solved, we must implement crop rotation to improve the soil; the implementation of crop rotation has a direct relationship with the collectivization and cooperativization of agriculture, and we must also consider the needs of cultivated land area, food, economic crops and feed, etc., which is also related to animal husbandry; agricultural irrigation must be related to afforestation; and when dividing agricultural areas, we must not only consider the relationship between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but also consider the distribution of industry.

    We must learn Michurin Biological Science from practical work. In terms of agricultural science alone, if we want to understand the relationship between crops and the environment, we must first carry out a series of basic investigation and research work, such as the universal survey of national soils and the survey of crop varieties. If we do not know what varieties we have, if we do not know the basic conditions of soils, hydrology, and meteorology in various places, we cannot talk about any research work at all. The Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences collected tens of thousands of wheat varieties from all over the world and used Michurin Biological Science's theory of stage development to analyze the characteristics of various varieties. Soviet agricultural scientists mastered the characteristics of tens of thousands of wheat varieties in the world and cultivated excellent new species. If we do not understand the soil conditions in various regions of the country, it will be difficult to start researching crop rotation, fertilizers, and other issues. Some people may think that these tasks are very simple, but if we do not master the new viewpoints of soil science and Michurin Biological Science, it will be difficult for even this simple work to achieve any results. Here it must be mentioned that Michurin Biological Science and Williams's [Note 6] soil science are two aspects of one problem. It is very meaningful for us to link the two together, learn in a planned and systematic way, and take the universal survey of national soils as the starting point for establishing our basic research work. The universal survey of crop varieties is also the same. If we can complete all the stage development records of various cultivated crops in a short period of time, we can start to establish a national breeding system on this basis.

    We must learn Michurin Biological Science with a mass viewpoint. The wisdom of the laboring people and the abundant experience of labor models will provide us with many learning materials. The creation of the masses has enriched science, and science has promoted the practice of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; practice in turn promotes scientific development, and science then dynamically guides practice. From learning and summarizing the various brilliant creations of the masses, we can better help us learn Michurin Biological Science.

    The motherland's agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry have put forward urgent requirements to us. We should establish our biological science work according to the urgent needs of national construction and the long-term plans of national construction. The biological community should draw a blueprint for the development of biological science, and establish basic work related to crop cultivation, crop rotation, soil, breeding, protection forest belts, sand afforestation, forest land renewal, soil and water conservation, pasture, economic crops, medicinal plants, animal husbandry, and other aspects, as well as the necessary theoretical work. The biological science community should convene special meetings in the future to study and formulate work plans. Biological science is no longer a "contemplative, descriptive" science, it will be a powerful weapon for mankind to conquer nature and build a communist society.

     Appendix Notes
     [Note 1] Morgan was an American geneticist who advocated the so-called "gene theory," believing that the material basis for determining biological traits is on the chromosomes in the cell nucleus. He used fruit flies as the main material for experiments.

    为坚持生物科学的米丘林方向而斗争
    编者按：中国共产党中国科学院支部，在本年四月间，讨论了该院前遗传选种实验馆馆长乐天宇同志所犯的错误。支部大会认为：这个错误的性质是属于严重的无组织无纪律，严重的脱离群众的学阀作风，以及学术工作上的严重的非马克思主义倾向。为了进一步批判乐天宇同志在生物科学工作上的错误，政务院文化教育委员会计划局科学卫生处会同中国科学院计划局在本年四月至六月间先后召集了三次生物科学工作座谈会。还讨论了目前生物科学的状况及其中若干问题，并对今后工作交换了初步的意见。参加这三次座谈会的有竺可桢（中国科学院），赵沨、孟庆哲、何祚庥（政务院文化教育委员会计划局），耿光波、陈仁（中央农业部），张景钺、刘次元（北京大学），周家炽、姜炳权、朱振声（北京农业大学），陈凤桐、祖德明（华北农业科学研究所），钱崇澍、吴征镒（中国科学院植物分类研究所），乐天宇、徐纬英、梁正兰、胡含（中国科学院遗传选种实验馆），李健武（清华大学），金成忠（中国科学院植物生理研究室），黄作杰、孙济中（中国科学院达尔文主义研究班），恽子强、丁瓒、汪志华、何成钧、简焯坡（中国科学院编译局及计划局）等人。本文是前两次座谈会的结论，在最后一次座谈会上，上述到会者基本上同意本文中的论点。其中如最后列举的各项工作，还只是初步的意见，有待于更深入的讨论。关于目前生物科学的状况，特别是关于摩尔根主义对旧生物学、旧遗传学的影响，需要继续展开系统的批判。一、米丘林生物科学是自觉而彻底地将马克思列宁主义应用于生物科学的伟大成就。
    米丘林生物科学是生物科学上的根本革命。它用辩证唯物主义作为它的哲学基础，证明了生物发展的辩证过程。由于掌握了生物发展的规律，它把生物科学发展到了全新的、更高的阶段。
    生物科学，在米丘林之前，只是“默想的”、“描述的”科学。米丘林生物科学的革命性质首先便在于它的实践性，在于它不仅要认识生物界，而且要改造生物界。正因为它揭示了这种生物发展过程的方向、规律、因素和动力，它才能作用于劳动人民改变、改造生物界，建设共产主义的事业。
    首先，米丘林生物科学肯定生物发展的决定因素在于有机物同环境的统一，由这个命题出发，才达到生物体从外界环境条件中创造了自身、同时也从这里改变自己的结论。所谓“物种永久不变”，只不过是法西斯种族主义者的“人种优生计划”的理论根据而已。
    苏联的生物学者以对于生物与环境的相互关系的正确认识为基础，改造了农业生物学，击毁了“田地肥沃递减律”、“收获的限界”、“自然界生物的过剩”等等伪科学的“规律”，争取了农业生产的空前提高。
    其次，米丘林生物科学肯定了生物界的联系和相互依属性，就是说同种生物与各种生物在其共同生存与生存竞争和斗争中的联系和依属，也就是生物种内的无斗争无互助，与种间的有互助有斗争的联系和依属，由这个辩证的命题出发，达到了同种间无斗争，即令发生非常态的同种个体因生活条件的竞争而引起灾难，也决不是物种发展的动力和根本。揭穿了认为同种间的斗争、天然淘汰是生物进化的基本因素的伪科学，它只是在为资产阶级臆造的什么“人口过剩”、“生活资料不足”理论找根据，为资本主义条件下的劳动人民的贫困情况作辩解罢了。
    苏联的生物学者以对于生物的相互依属的正确认识为基础，检定了同种与各种生物间的关系，认识了各种生物间的斗争和互助；在农业中提倡轮作，改良土壤，建设防风林带……为改造自然的计划建立了正确的理论基础。
    第三，米丘林生物科学正确地认识了生物内部机体的统一——部分与整体的辩证的统一，由这个辩证的命题出发，达到了遗传性依属于机体、一定的遗传性和机体一同形成也和机体一同变化的结论。揭穿了把部分和整体对立起来的摩尔根〔注一〕之辈关于染色体遗传理论的伪科学。摩尔根辈认为神秘的“遗传基因”是永生不灭的，这完全是一种臆造。大地上一切生命都是从无生命发生的，我们决不能拿超自然力创造生命的神学信仰来解释生命的起源和形成。
    第四，米丘林生物科学从内部对立物的斗争为生物发展的动力这一辩证的命题出发，观察了同化与异化作用、新陈代谢、创造与破坏、不断的革新与变化、由量变到质变的生物生命过程，创造了加强机体内在矛盾、使它改造、适应新的条件而育成新种的方法，从而达到了农业生产和畜牧事业上的伟大的丰产成就。
    米丘林生物科学就在揭发生物与环境间、生物与生物间，生物机体部分与整体间的辩证联系中，认识了生物发展的规律性。像孟德尔〔注二〕、魏斯曼〔注三〕辈把生物发展说成是各种染色体的完全偶然性的配合，便使科学在改造、驾驭自然的伟大任务之前全部解除了武装。
    二、米丘林生物科学不是生物学中的“一
            个部门”，而是生物科学的根本变
            革。
    米丘林生物科学完全改变了生物科学的面貌。以米丘林生物科学为指导，苏联生物学者在生物科学的各方面获得了伟大的成就。巴甫洛夫揭发了生物的心理与生理职能之相互依属和影响的事实；勒帕辛斯卡娅成功地证明了新细胞的形成不仅是经由细胞本身的繁殖，而且还直接从非细胞体中发生；泊什扬〔注四〕确定了微生物和病毒是同一有机体发展的不同阶段，滤过性病毒可以转变为微生物形态，微生物也可能变为病毒……所有这些，说明了米丘林生物科学对生物科学各部门有着多么大的启发意义，证明了米丘林生物科学绝不是生物科学中的“一个部门”，而是生物科学的根本变革。
    米丘林生物科学被介绍到我国已经好几年了，有关的著作已被翻译了出来。许多生物学者，青年学生正以极大的热情来学习米丘林生物科学；不少学校和研究机构正在根据米丘林学说对课程、研究工作进行着改革。但是，我国也有一部分的生物学者们好像还没有正视这个事实，有些生物学家对米丘林生物科学甚至采取反对的态度，说什么“站不住脚的米丘林学说只是一些粗糙、浮面的观察，根本不懂得什么叫遗传”。这种见解是不值一驳的。如果把米丘林、李森科改良果树和作物的实践看作粗糙的观察，那末摩尔根主义者在饲瓶中繁殖果蝇、切断鼠尾等等与实践脱节的实验就算是“数学一样的准确与可靠”吗？也有人采取避而不谈的办法，说什么“我根本不考虑这个问题”，或者说“各人对遗传的定义不同”。这种人把遗传看作是：生物有所谓种质和体质，种质永恒不变，通过“基因”遗传给后代。于是他们做了一些可笑的实验：用刀子切断鼠尾，虽然经过好几代的切除，其后代仍然有尾巴。这就是他们的万古不变的“遗传”定义。还有不少人认为，米丘林生物科学是“一家之言”，不加可否。大学中生物科学各部门基本上原封未动，旧生物学的观点仍然贯串在课程的各方面，米丘林生物科学只是一个“学期课程”。更严重的是，一方面承认什么孟德尔辈的遗传学说，一方面又说李森科创立新见，推翻旧说。在中学生物学教科书中，米丘林生物科学只占一个章节；在讲到生物科学的研究方法时，对于科学工作中指导思想的作用，根本没有适当地加以说明，竟把“用思想研究问题”和所谓科学的观察、试验方法对立起来。
    在实际工作中，有些农业科学机构仍把主要的工作放在抗病育种上，纯系育种〔注五〕的方法仍然是基本的方法，纯系理论仍然是基本的指导理论。
    所谓纯种，自然界发展史早就证明纯系是不会存在的神话。就是达尔文也不自觉地揭发了生物在物种发展过程中的细微的量变的积累，与其向根本的质的变化转变的事实。正如李森科在“斯大林与米丘林生物学”一文中指出的：“达尔文的不朽著作，科学地证明：有机世界不断地变化和发展，它有自己的历史，有自己的过去，现在和将来。达尔文的伟大功绩，就在于证明有机世界是在自然规律基础上发展的。”因为纯系根本是不存在的，纯系育种就只好如摩尔根主义者那样，把所谓科学建筑在偶然的巧遇上，求助于统计和幸运。建筑在偶然幸运上的“纯系路线”，在工作中，把一切希望建筑在偶然的巧遇上，即进行盲目性、偶然性的挑选以图找到什么“同质的基因配合”。这除了引起资财人力的浪费外，一定只会招致品种的退化与毁灭。米丘林早就说过：“全部自然界的生命不是停滞于自己的形态的，它在不停地前进，不断地变化，而且生物的一切形态，如因某种原因而停止自己的发展，则必然注定会消灭的。”（见米丘林全集一卷六二九页）但我们的一部分农业科学家，连辩证唯物论的基本观点都还没有接受。
    即使有人用新的方法做一些工作，如月光花和甘薯的嫁接，但实验分析并没有遵循着米丘林的原则。我们可以说，这是“米丘林的方法，摩尔根的原则”。其他如分枝小麦的育种，由于取材不广，调查不够，设计不精，并且对于分枝小麦变异性不强的特点没有充分的估计，恐怕一时难于达到预期结果。
    米丘林生物科学的伟大，在于它彻头彻尾为提高农业生产、改造自然服务。但这一点好像没有引起我们的生物学者的注意。我们的植物分类工作，仍然片面地致力于野生植物，且为分类而分类。不注意植物的分布、产量、生活习性、经济价值等方面的研究，因而不能密切联系实际工作。大学中的研究工作，也往往提倡做些冷门的工作以求成名，比如学生要研究臭虫生活史来消灭臭虫，但教授要学生研究腔肠动物。学生要研究改良役畜品种，但教授要学生研究青蛙的肝糖变化。这样就使学校的研究工作脱离了实际生活。
    上述情况说明，我国生物科学的现况已经到了不能容忍的地步，如果长此以往，“生物科学为国家建设事业服务”，将只是一句空谈。认真地系统地学习米丘林生物科学，对于我国生物学界是迫切的需要。
    三、狭隘的经验主义、轻视理论的观点，
            把米丘林生物科学变成了枯燥的教
            条，同样阻碍了米丘林生物科学在我
            国的发展。
    米丘林生物科学是从生物科学服务于农业实践这
    一思想出发，创造了完整的关于论述生物和管理生物的科学理论体系，并把它应用到改造自然、造福人民的农业实践上去。米丘林生物科学的伟大是在于它为改造自然的共产主义建设服务，同时在理论上击毁了为资本主义剥削制度作辩解的伪科学，为改造自然的共产主义建设找出了科学上的理论根据。理论和实际一致是马克思列宁主义的根本原则之一，任何的偏颇一定要引导出错误的结论。
    我国在介绍、宣传、学习、研究米丘林生物科学的工作中，发生了一种经验主义和教条主义的偏向，这种偏向的主要代表者便是乐天宇同志。乐天宇同志过去工作中曾有不少成绩，如在抗日战争和解放战争时期推广甜菜的种植；在晋冀鲁豫边区设立兽医站；并培养了一些农业技术干部；在艰苦环境中能够克服困难，并初步提倡了米丘林生物科学，有过一些成绩。但是，乐天宇同志在工作中也产生了相当严重的错误和缺点，其中最主要的便是经验主义和教条主义的偏向。
    这种偏向首先表现在重视点滴的生产经验，忽视系统的农学理论；强调从生产中学习，否定实验室工作；认为“农场就是实验室，大自然就是课堂”。我们认为，把理性知识和感性知识对立起来，割裂开来，强调一面忽视另一面，都是不对的。我们反对脱离实际的教条主义偏向，同时也反对忽视理论的经验主义偏向。这种轻视理论的经验主义偏向，本质上便是非马克思列宁主义的。
    乐天宇同志在这种思想支配之下，产生了严重的错误，他说什么“我们在‘显微镜’下解决问题，老百姓从栽培上解决问题。老百姓如果不靠自然规律解决问题，就要饿死。‘学者们’没有生活问题，可以不靠自然规律来作。老百姓是唯物论，学者们是唯心论”（见中国米丘林学会会刊一卷一期，乐天宇的闭幕词）。为了克服科学工作与实际脱节的状况，要求科学家理论联系实际，科学为国家农业建设服务是必要的。但绝不能错误地、幼稚地把理论和实际对立起来。
    乐天宇同志又说“这些理论非常简单，……我以为无论有没有文化，就是小孩子都能了解米丘林科学的”（见中国米丘林学会会刊一卷一期乐天宇的闭幕词）。把米丘林生物科学应用到农业实践方面，把它推广、普及到群众中去是必要的，真正的科学真理也往往是浅显易懂的道理，但绝不能因此而轻视、降低科学工作的意义。因为，马克思列宁主义对于科学的看法，是一方面承认科学从属于社会存在，是社会存在的反映；但一方面也承认科学具有一定的相对独立性，积极地、能动地影响社会存在的能力。
    这种错误的左倾幼稚观点，全盘否定了传统生物科学。乐天宇同志的逻辑是：既然物种是一直在变化着的，植物分类学自然一无用处了，病虫害的研究也毫无用处，因为只要培育出不怕病害不受虫害的品种就行了。生物与环境的关系是米丘林学说的基本内容，既然肯定米丘林生物科学，又怎能说生物不会受到像病、虫等的侵袭呢。乐天宇同志对待像生物统计一类的学问，也是采取完全否定的态度。是的，生物发展的规律绝不能用数学的规律来代替，必须反对把生物界的规律还原为数学游戏。谁也不会承认统计是万能的学问，但其中有用的部分可以整理出来，使之变成生物科学中的一个有用的部门。
    其次，乐天宇同志的另一偏向，是不把米丘林生物科学看作实践的指针，而把它用作吓人的符咒。
    马克思列宁主义者认为只有辩证唯物论是指导科学实践的唯一正确法则，也主张并且鼓励人们用辩证唯物论的观点来解释历史和科学。但教条主义者却只是牵强附会地搬用哲学术语，把唯物辩证法的
    一般规律去代替生物科学中的一些具体规律。
    乐天宇同志写的“遗传选种要义”一书，基本上是抄袭李森科、特洛申等人的著作而成的，其中整个的章节颠倒混乱，使人不知所云。例如该书第十页上写着：“没有选择和适当的培养，农业实践所创造的动植物品种，是永远不会出现的。这就像我们到鞋铺挑选鞋子似的。仅仅挑选了样子好的和长短合适的，并没有什么创造。”这两句话，是抄自李森科的“农业生物学”的四二四页和四二三页。因为把次序都抄颠倒了，便变成前后矛盾的了。前面一句话肯定地说，自然与人工选择是农业实践的创造，后面一句话是说自然与人工选择只起着挑选的作用，而不能创造新种，这个挑鞋子的比喻本来是不伦不类的。李森科这样说：“选择不是选择死的、凝固的物体，而是植物和动物的选择，就是生物有机体的选择，那么结论也就应该不同。生物有机体本身或者他们的后代是继续生活下去，因而也继续改变，同时照例向已经开始的方向而改变。”这正说明旧的农学家，他们不企图去影响生物发展的规律过程，也不创造由人类需要指导生物变化的条件，归根结蒂，只是一种偶然性的探索，倒真像挑选鞋子的比喻一样。但是乐天宇同志把这两句话抄在一起，是什么意思呢？是肯定自然与人工选择具有创造性呢？还是自然与人工选择只是挑鞋子呢？这一方面说明了乐天宇同志的草率，也说明了如果只把米丘林生物科学当作教条，不仅对实际工作没有任何好处，反而只会引起混乱，使工作招致损失。
    教条主义的偏向，更表现在牵强附会地搬用哲学术语上。比如说什么“矛盾必需要求统一，才能生存，这个统一便发生了物质的运动，而产生生物发展的动力”（见“遗传选种要义”二十页）。我们知道，内部对立物的斗争是生物发展的动力，这是马克思列宁主义的命题，但“矛盾的统一便产生生物发展的动力”的说法，无疑地是一种常识的错误。我们能把对立物的斗争和矛盾的统一混为一谈么？
        米丘林生物科学认为，生物发展是由量变过渡到根本的质的变化的过程。但乐天宇同志却说什么
    “质变有两种不同方式：第一，从量变到质变，就是说量变到一定程度时即起质变。这种方式我们称之为改良方式。第二，生物在发育阶段因生活条件的不同而引起质变，这种方式，我们称之为革命方式”（见“遗传选种要义”二十七页）。这里简直不知道是说的什么了，因为我们既不能说天然变种是改良方式，人工变种是革命方式；也不是说量变的逐渐积累过程是改良方式，飞跃的质变过程是革命方式。斯大林同志在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中说：“辩证法不是把发展过程看作什么简单增长的过程，看作数变不会引起质变的过程，而是看作由不显露的细小数变进到显露的变，进到根本的变，进到质变的发展过程，在这个过程中质变不是逐渐地发生，而是迅速和突然地发生，即表现于由
    一种状态突变为另一种状态，并不是偶然发生，而是规律式地发生，即是由许多不明显的逐渐的数变积累而引起的结果。”很明显，马克思列宁主义认为一切物体、物质的运动形态的发展，其本身包含着两种变化，即进化的与革命的，数变逐渐积累过程的量变与飞跃发展转变为新质的质变。并没有什么两种质变，如乐天宇同志所理解的改良方式的质变和革命方式的质变。怪不得群众说，乐天宇同志讲米丘林生物科学真是“似是而非，莫知所云”，
    “啼笑皆非，愈听愈糊涂”。
    四、乐天宇同志的武断的非科学态度、恶
            劣的学阀作风，使国家科学事业遭受
            到重大的损失。
    马克思列宁主义者应该是最具有科学态度的人。因为，马克思列宁主义的特征首先便在于它的实践性和战斗性，不是空论，而是一切从事实出发。毛主席教导我们，马克思列宁主义者必须实事求是。马克思列宁主义既然是研究客观事物的内部联系即规律性的真理，马克思列宁主义者便应该是最具有科学态度的人。马克思列宁主义的科学家更应该如此。
    但是，作为共产党员的乐天宇同志，对于科学工作却采取一种武断、肤浅的非科学的态度，他在批评旧遗传学时，便采取这种态度。我们知道，旧遗传学中所捏造的“基因”，自然是一种臆造，我们应该用理论和实践来驳斥它的虚妄。在这方面，苏联的生物学者早已用事实说明这种所谓基因纯粹性定律的虚伪了；但乐天宇同志在他的论文“米丘林生物科学的哲学基础”中，却武断地说：“这种基因不但任何人没有看见过，连摩尔根自己也没有看见过，他拿这种虚伪的基因来肯定生物遗传的性状，这种看法是不真实的，是不可掌握的，而是一种幻想，幻想就是唯心论”（见自然科学讲座生物之部第二十五页）。只用见过或没有见过的理由来批评
    一种科学上的假设，是太不充分了。譬如原子、分子也是不可见的，但谁能说原子、分子是不存在的呢？
    马克思列宁主义者必须根据具体材料分析具体问题，对不同的问题必须用不同的态度去对待。因而处理学术问题和处理政治问题应该有所区别。我们不能批评旧生物学家“唯心”、“反动”、“为资产阶级服务”、“法西斯”便算了事。我们应该说清楚：生物科学上摩尔根主义和米丘林生物科学的斗争是两种世界观在科学上的表现，是不容调和的根本性质的论争。旧生物学某些部分已经证明是伪科学，旧遗传学的某些结论是法西斯主义的理论基础之一，某些旧的农学在实践中被证明“差不多全是坏的”（米丘林）。所以它必须加以改造。我们可以说旧遗传学的思想是反动的，但不能说信服旧遗传学的学者一定就是政治上的反动分子。这是很明白的事。所以，我们反对用米丘林生物科学作为一根打人的鞭子，用米丘林生物科学作为护身的符咒，掩盖自己的无知。这正如列宁指出的：“假如一个共产主义者，只根据自己所学得的现成结论，却不用一番极认真、极艰苦而浩繁的功夫，不理解他所必须用批判态度来对待的实际事物，便想用共产主义这字眼来妄自矜夸，那么，这样的共产主义是很可悲的。”（见“青年团的任务”）。
    乐天宇同志对群众采取关门主义的态度，不依靠多数人来推动工作，以至于群众说他是“霸占米丘林学说”。他自己既不好好的研究米丘林，也阻碍别人研究米丘林。如有人对他的工作提意见，他就说是反对米丘林；有人反对他的恶劣作风，他就说对方政治上有问题，别有用心。正如中国共产党中国科学院支部大会上大家对乐天宇同志的批评一样：“他不许别人学米丘林，因为那是‘投机’，也不许别人不学米丘林，因为那是‘反动’”。应该指出，这种作风和共产党员的作风无丝毫相似之处。列宁教导我们：“先锋队……除非在各种各样的活动方面都与非共产党员结成联盟，便根本谈不到什么有成效的共产主义建设工作。”（见“论战斗唯物主义的意义”）。但乐天宇同志用这样的态度对待科学，用这样的作风来领导国家的科学研究工作，用这样的态度来对待群众，自然只会使国家的科学事业遭到重大的损失。
    乐天宇同志所犯错误的思想根源，主要是十分强烈的个人英雄主义。正如刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一文中所描述的：“有这种思想的人，他首先计较他个人在党内地位的高低。他好出风头，欢喜别人奉承他、抬举他，他有个人领袖的欲望，他逞能干、好居功、好表现自己，好包办，没有‘涵养’，有浓厚的虚荣心，不愿埋头苦干，不愿作技术工作。他骄傲，有了一点成功，即盛气凌人，不可一世，压倒别人，不能平等地谦逊和气地待人。他自满，好为人师，好教训别人，指挥别人，总想爬在别人头上，而不受别人的指挥，不向别人尤其不向群众虚心学习，不接受别人的批评。他只能‘高升’，不能‘下降’，只能‘行时’，不能‘倒霉’，他受不起打击和委屈，处理自己没有伸缩性，不是‘能屈能伸的大丈夫’。他‘好名’的孽根未除，他企图在共产主义事业中把自己造成为‘伟大人物’与‘英雄’，甚至为了满足他这种欲望而不选择手段。……在这种人的思想中残存着剥削阶级的意识，不了解共产主义的伟大，没有共产主义的伟大胸怀。”乐天宇同志严重的无组织无纪律行为和脱离群众的学阀作风以及学术工作上的严重的非马克思主义倾向，已经严重地影响了米丘林生物科学在中国的发展和推广。因此，批判这种思想对我们说来是极为必要的。
    五、在实际工作中学习米丘林生物科学，
            用米丘林生物科学彻底改造生物科学
            的各部门，为坚持生物科学的米丘林
            方向而斗争。
    米丘林生物科学介绍到中国来已经两三年了，我们不能使之仍然停留在介绍的阶段。如何使米丘林生物科学和中国农林、畜牧事业相结合，如何用米丘林生物科学批判和改造旧生物学中资产阶级反动的伪科学观点，进而改造生物科学的各部门，如何建立基础的研究工作和理论工作，如何推广已获成效的农业技术等问题，都需要我们来加以解决。我们提出如下的一些意见，其中或许还有需要商榷的，也请大家讨论：
    我国的生物学界应该发动一个广泛深入的学习运动，来学习米丘林生物科学。
    学习米丘林生物科学，最重要的是学习它的根本，不是学习它的枝节。我们知道，米丘林生物科学，就其本质来说，是自觉而彻底地将马克思列宁主义应用于生物科学。米丘林生物科学和旧生物学是不同的宇宙观、不同的方法论在生物科学上的反映和应用，不学习马克思列宁主义便不可能正确、完整地学习米丘林生物科学。这也就是为什么有些生物学家只看到米丘林的嫁接、选种的方法，而看不出米丘林生物科学是生物科学的根本革命的原因。我们首先应该反对这种只用单纯技术观点来学习米丘林的态度。更重要的，要认清米丘林生物科学是生物科学的根本革命，纠正“米丘林生物科学仅是生物学中的一个部门”的错误说法，介绍苏联科学界基于米丘林生物科学而发展的蛋白质综合研究、生活物质研究、微生物和病毒相互转变等方面的成就，彻底改造生态学、细胞学、胚胎学、微生物学……等生物科学的各部门。
    要从批判旧生物学、旧遗传学的工作中来学习米丘林生物科学。大学生物学系，应把各种课程彻底地加以改革；要认真地把纯系理论加以彻底地批判，生物统计、生态学等部门中的有害部分也要予以批判。
    要从学习掌握马克思列宁主义的方法论来学习米丘林生物科学。比如，根据辩证唯物主义，我们认为：“自然界中任何一种现象，如果把它孤独拿来看，把它看作是与其周围条件没有联系的现象，那它就会是不可了解的东西，因为自然界任何部分中任何一种现象，如果把它看作是与周围条件没有联系的现象，看作是与它们隔离的现象，那它就会是毫无意思的东西。”（见斯大林“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）这些话对我们学习米丘林生物科学有着非常大的启发意义。比如，我们只就农业丰产问题来说，许多因子是相互关联的。如果选出了良种，但还要有合理的耕作方法；而密植和肥料有着密切关系；如果灌溉、肥料都解决了，就得实行轮作制，来改良土壤；实行轮作和农业的集体化、合作社化有着直接的关联，并且一定要考虑耕地数量、食粮、经济作物和饲料的需要量等等的问题，这便和畜牧事业也有着关联；农业灌溉一定与造林有关；而划分农作区域时，不仅要考虑农、林、畜牧事业三者的关联，而且要考虑工业分布的状况。
    要从实际工作中来学习米丘林生物科学。仅就农业科学方面说，如果我们要了解作物和环境的关系，首先便需要进行一连串的基本调查研究工作，如全国土壤的普遍调查和作物品种的调查。如果我们不了解我们有些什么品种，如果我们不知道各地的土壤以及水文、气象等方面的基本情况，我们便根本谈不到什么研究工作。苏联列宁农业科学研究院收集全世界小麦品种数万种，用米丘林生物科学的阶段发育学说来分析各种品种的特性。苏联农业科学家掌握了世界小麦品种数万种的性格，培育出了优良的新种。要是我们不了解全国各地区的土壤情况，便很难着手研究轮作、肥料等问题。也许有人认为这些工作是非常简单的，但是，如果不掌握土壤科学和米丘林生物科学的新观点，即是这种简单的工作也很难有什么成效。在这里必须提到，米丘林生物科学和威廉姆斯〔注六〕的土壤科学是一个问题的两个方面，我们把二者联系起来，有计划地、系统地进行学习，并以全国土壤的普遍调查作为建立我们的基本研究工作的起点，是很有意义的事。作物品种的普遍调查工作也是如此，如果我们能在短期内把各种栽培作物的阶段发育纪录全部完成，就可以在这样的基础上来着手建立全国的选种系统。
    要用群众观点来学习米丘林生物科学。劳动人民的智慧创造以及劳动模范的丰产经验，将向我们提供许多的学习材料。群众的创造丰富了科学，科学也推动着农林畜牧事业的实践；实践反过来推动科学发展，科学再能动地指导实践。我们从学习、总结群众的各种辉煌创造中，将可以更好地帮助我们学习米丘林生物科学。
    祖国的农、林、畜牧事业向我们提出了迫切的要求，我们应该根据国家建设的迫切需要和国家建设的长远打算，建立起我们的生物科学工作。生物学界应该画出一张生物科学发展的蓝图，把有关作物栽培、轮作、土壤、选种、防护林带、沙地造林、林地更新、水土保持、牧草、经济作物、药用植物、畜牧等方面的基本工作，以及必需的理论工作，建立起来。生物科学界将来应该召集专门会议，研究制订工作计划。生物科学再也不是什么“默想的、描述的”科学了，它将是人类征服自然，建设共产主义社会的有力武器。
