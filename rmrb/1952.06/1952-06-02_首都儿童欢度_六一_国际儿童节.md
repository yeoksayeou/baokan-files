Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The happy children of the capital of New China, in the thousands, today spent their holiday—International Children's Day "June 1st"—with boundless pride and joy.

    Today, all the famous scenic spots and historical sites in the capital, including the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, the Temple of Heaven, the Working People's Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, the Western Suburban Park, and the Summer Palace, were opened to children and parents with children free of charge.

    From early morning, thirty-two trams and eleven buses, specially opened for children free of charge, transported children from all corners of the city to the locations of festive activities batch by batch. More than four thousand children from villages in the near suburbs also came to the capital by car or train to celebrate the holiday.

    Today, the sky over the capital was clear and bright. In every park, colorful flags fluttered in the wind, and among the green trees were groups of healthy and lively Young Pioneer members wearing red scarves, as well as children wearing new holiday clothes and their parents. Groups of happy children unfolded various games, get-togethers, and garden party activities amidst endless laughter and singing.

    This year's "June 1st" International Children's Day activities in the capital were unprecedentedly warm and massive, with more than 300,000 children participating in organized activities; in addition, all schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and day-care centers in the city also had decentralized celebrations in different forms, and some schools held ceremonies for new Young Pioneer members to join the organization today. Such an enthusiastic celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day demonstrates the boundless happiness of children growing up in the Mao Zedong era; it also demonstrates the great strength of the people of the capital in protecting children and defending world peace. Some representatives from China who attended the International Conference for the Defense of Children, representatives from Vietnam, Burma, Australia, and other countries who visited China after attending the International Conference for the Defense of Children, and representatives from Australia, Canada, India, the United States, and other countries who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference also participated in today's "June 1st" celebration activities in the capital.

    Those who went to the parks to join the children in the celebration included: Peng Zhen, Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Wu Han, Deputy Mayor, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Education, Rong Gaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Yang Bozhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Zhang Xiaomei, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, as well as hundreds of soldiers and heroes from the People's Liberation Army, People's Volunteer Army's army, navy, and air force, workers and model laborers, writers, and artists.

    The heroic soldiers and model workers gave the children great encouragement. When they joined the children in the celebration or told their heroic stories, they received the children's extraordinary respect and repeated cheers. The children all expressed to them: they will study hard and prepare to take them as examples to build the motherland, defend the motherland, and defend world peace. The thousands upon thousands of children in the capital of New China not only feel their current happiness, but also see their infinitely bright future.

    In various famous places, there were also exhibitions of children's academic achievements, life pictures, and other materials, as well as children's reading stations, for children to freely view. When children visited the capital's famous scenic spots and historical sites, they especially felt the great labor and creation of their ancestors and the loveliness of their motherland.

    Today, seventeen cinemas in the capital screened films such as "Children of New China," "Happy Childhood," and "Little Sailor" to entertain children free of charge; and eleven film teams went to the suburbs to screen films for children. Seventeen cultural centers throughout the city showed slides to children. The China Youth Art Theatre, the Central University for Nationalities Cultural Troupe, and other art groups also performed multiple literary and artistic performances for children today. Today, all bookstores, stationery stores, and toy stores in the city offered discounts to children. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant invited two hundred children from six schools in the capital to the steel plant today for a get-together.

    On the eve of "June 1st," on the evening of the 31st, children in the capital held a representative "June 1st" celebration meeting of five thousand people, and the children of the embassies and diplomatic missions of twelve countries including the Soviet Union in China were also invited to participate. Many heads of organizations, combat heroes, model workers, scientists, writers, and artists attended the meeting to congratulate the children. The meeting wrote letters of respect to Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, expressing their infinite love for them.
