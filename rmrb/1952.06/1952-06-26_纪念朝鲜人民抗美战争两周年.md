    A Letter of Respect from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army

    Respected General Kim Il-sung and all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army Comrades:

    Today marks the second anniversary of the heroic Korean people's liberation war against the American imperialist aggression under your wise leadership. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of all Chinese workers, extends our highest and warmest respect to you and all comrades of the Korean People's Army under your leadership! And congratulations on your great contribution to safeguarding world peace!

    The joint operations of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have resulted in a severe blow to the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, disrupting the American imperialists' timetable for aggression against the world. The shameless crimes of the American aggressors, such as germ warfare, the massacre of prisoners of war, and the sabotage of armistice negotiations, only demonstrate that the American aggressors are at the end of their rope.

    In order to mobilize workers around the world to support the just war of the Korean and Chinese people, the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a call to designate June 25 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions warmly responds to this call and is determined to further mobilize all Chinese workers to broadly carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and to strengthen national defense and economic construction, in order to fully support the Korean front and strive for the early final victory of the Korean people's liberation war!

        A Letter of Respect from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to General Peng Dehuai and the Volunteers

    Respected General Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Comrades:

    On the occasion of June 25, 1952 – the second anniversary of the Korean People's War of Liberation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of all workers in the country, extends our highest respect to you and all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers under your leadership! Congratulations on the great victory you have achieved in the war against the American aggressors!

    The heroic and just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers not only effectively defended the security of the motherland and aided the liberation of the Korean people, but also made a significant contribution to the sacred cause of safeguarding world peace.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions has designated June 25 as the International Day of Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace, calling on workers around the world to support the just war of the Chinese and Korean peoples. This shows that the war waged by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army side-by-side against American imperialist aggression in Korea has great international significance. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is enthusiastically responding to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, mobilizing workers across the country to broadly carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, strengthening the motherland's national defense construction and economic construction, and doing everything possible to support you, support the Korean front, and strive for the early final victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea!

        A Telegram of Respect from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the Korean Workers

                To the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, to the Korean workers, brothers and sisters:

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the heroic Korean people's resistance to American imperialist aggression and the great victory already achieved, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the Chinese working class, extends our highest respect and warmest regards to you.

    The heroic Korean working class and working people have made great contributions and heroic sacrifices in the struggle against American imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace over the past two years, which has aroused deep sympathy among the working class and peace-loving people around the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions has designated June 25, the day you rose up to resist the American-launched aggression against Korea, as the International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace, which is a great honor for you. All the despicable and shameless atrocities committed by American imperialism in Korea, such as indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and people, massacre of prisoners of war, spreading of germs, and sabotage of armistice negotiations, have aroused the public outrage of the working class and working people around the world. The victory of the Korean people and the fate of American imperialism's defeat have already been sealed.

    Dear Korean worker brothers and sisters: We, the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country, vow to be your backing. Let us unite more closely, strengthen our struggle against our common enemy—the American imperialists—and strive for an early and victorious end to the Korean War.
                                                All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                                            June 24

        A Telegram of Respect from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the Korean People's Army

    Dear Comrades of the Korean People's Army!

    We, the women of China and the peace-loving women of the world, respond to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation and designate June 25 as the "International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace." We will more actively support you with practical actions to defend world peace.

    The just struggle of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side-by-side against the American aggressors has achieved a great victory and strengthened itself in victory. Now, American imperialism in Korea, on the one hand, attempts to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations, and on the other hand, carries out brutal germ warfare. But this can never save it from its fate of defeat. Victory will surely belong to the people of the two countries, Korea and China, and the people of the world. We extend our heartfelt condolences and highest respect to you.
                                    All-China Democratic Women's Federation

        A Telegram of Respect from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the Volunteers

    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Korean War, we extend our heartfelt condolences and highest respect to you with boundless love. Because your just struggle in Korea against the American aggressors has defended the motherland, thereby safeguarding the happy lives of the women, mothers, and children of the motherland.

    Let us excitedly tell you: The men and women of the motherland are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call, actively launching a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy in all aspects, vigorously supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers, and also striving to do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of the Volunteers. We believe that the close cooperation between the front and the rear will surely stop the crimes of the American aggressors in sabotaging armistice negotiations and waging germ warfare, and will surely achieve final victory.
                                    All-China Democratic Women's Federation

        A Telegram of Respect from the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the Korean Women

                To the Korean Democratic Women's League:

    Dear Korean Sisters:

    We, the women of China and the peace-loving women of the world, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation and designate June 25 as the "International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace."

    We deeply hate the brutal crimes committed by the American aggressors against Korean women and children, especially the germ warfare, indiscriminate bombing, and use of gasoline bombs they have carried out; and we express our highest respect for your heroic and unyielding struggle for Korean liberation and world peace. Dear sisters, we, the women of the whole country, must continue to work hard to vigorously support you in all aspects until the Korean issue is resolved fairly and reasonably, and Korean women and children can build their happy lives in a peaceful environment.
    All-China Democratic Women's Federation June 24, 1952

    To the China Peace Committee in Defense of World Peace in Beijing:

    Dear Korean People's Army: Dear Chinese People's Volunteers:

    The preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is currently being held in Beijing, the capital of our motherland. At this moment, the second anniversary of the Korean War – the "Day of Defending Peace" for peace-loving people all over the world – is approaching. We are industrialists and businessmen of the new China, and we are always concerned about the Korean people's great patriotic war, and we are always concerned about the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers. On this significant anniversary, we would like to extend our sincere condolences and highest respect to the heroic and invincible soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. The Korean people's great patriotic war and the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea have powerfully crushed the American imperialists' aggressive adventures and powerfully defended world peace. We, the industrialists and businessmen of the new China, hereby solemnly assure you: We are determined to work with the people of the whole country, in our own posts, to increase production, practice strict economy, continue to strengthen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, fully support you, and smash the American imperialists' conspiracy to delay the Korean peace talks, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. Fight on, victory will surely be ours! With victory and respect!

    纪念朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年
    中华全国总工会给金日成将军及朝鲜人民军的致敬信
    敬爱的金日成将军暨朝鲜人民军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    英雄的朝鲜人民，在您的英明领导下进行的反对美帝国主义侵略的解放战争，到今天已经二周年了。中华全国总工会谨代表全中国工人，向您和您领导的朝鲜人民军全体同志们致以崇高的热诚的敬意！并祝贺你们对保卫世界和平所作的伟大的贡献！
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的并肩作战的结果，已使美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭受到了严重的打击，打乱了美帝国主义侵略世界的战争时间表。美国侵略者所进行的细菌战、屠杀战俘和破坏停战谈判的无耻罪行，不过是说明美国侵略者日暮途穷而已。
    世界工会联合会为了发动全世界工人支援朝、中人民的正义战争，已发出了定六月二十五日为国际声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日的号召。中华全国总工会热烈响应这一号召，决进一步发动全中国工人广泛地开展增产节约运动，加强国防与经济建设，以全力来支援朝鲜前线，争取朝鲜人民的解放战争早日取得最后胜利！

    中国人民志愿军的英勇的正义的斗争，不只是有效地保卫了祖国的安全、援助了朝鲜人民解放；同时对于保卫世界和平的神圣事业也作了巨大的贡献。
    世界工会联合会定六月二十五日为国际声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日，号召全世界工人支援朝、中两国人民的正义战争。这说明英勇的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军肩并肩地进行反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，具有重大的国际意义。中华全国总工会正在热烈地响应世界工联的号召，发动全国工人广泛地开展增产节约运动，加强祖国的国防建设与经济建设，尽一切力量来支援你们，支援朝鲜前线，争取抗美援朝早日取得最后的胜利！

    当此朝鲜人民英勇抗击美帝国主义侵略并已获得伟大胜利的两周年之际，中华全国总工会谨代表中国工人阶级向你们致最崇高的敬礼和最亲切的慰问。
    英勇的朝鲜工人阶级与劳动人民，两年来在反对美帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平的斗争中作了巨大的贡献和英勇的牺牲，在全世界工人阶级与爱好和平的人民当中已经引起深切的同情。世界工会联合会已把你们奋起抗击美国发动侵略朝鲜的日子——六月二十五日，作为国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日，这是你们的极大的光荣。美帝国主义在朝鲜所进行的一切卑鄙无耻的暴行如对于和平城市与人民滥施轰炸，屠杀战俘，撒布细菌，破坏停战谈判等已引起全世界工人阶级与劳动人民的公愤。朝鲜人民的胜利与美帝国主义失败的命运已经注定了。
    亲爱的朝鲜工人兄弟姊妹们：我们中国工人和全国人民誓为你们的后盾，让我们更紧密地团结起来，加强我们反对共同敌人——美帝国主义者——的斗争，争取早日胜利地结束朝鲜战争。
