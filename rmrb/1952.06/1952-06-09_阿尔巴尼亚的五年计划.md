Albania's economy has seen tremendous development in recent years. Albania is now smoothly implementing its Five-Year Plan from 1951 to 1955.

By 1955, Albania's industrial output will reach three and a half times that of 1950, equivalent to twelve times that of the pre-war period. During the Five-Year Plan period, many large factories and construction projects will be established, such as the Cerrik oil refinery and power station, the Shkodër steel plant and tobacco factory, the Tirana wool textile factory, paper mill, and glass factory, and the large hydroelectric power station on the Mat River with a generating capacity of 20,000 kilowatts; a new railway will be built from Vlorë to Mamurras and from Cerrik to Peqin.

Within five years, the total agricultural output will increase by 71 percent, equivalent to two and a half times that of the pre-war period. This astonishing progress makes it possible to increase the consumption of staple foods and their products by 50 to 100 percent.

Albania has been forever freed from poverty and backwardness and has embarked on the road to prosperity, happiness, and socialist construction.

    阿尔巴尼亚的五年计划
    阿尔巴尼亚的经济最近几年来有了巨大的发展。现在阿尔巴尼亚正在顺利地执行着自一九五一年至一九五五年的五年计划。
    到一九五五年时，阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产量将达到一九五○年产量的三倍半，等于战前的十二倍。在五年计划期内，许多大工厂与建设工程，如塞里库的炼油厂和电力站，斯库德尔的钢铁厂和烟草制造厂、地拉那的毛纺厂、造纸厂和玻璃工厂，在马蒂河上的发电量达二万瓩的大水力发电厂，都将建立起来；从符罗拉到曼麦里加与从塞里库到丕勃尔则将建设一条新的铁路。
    在五年内，农业总产量要提高百分之七十一，等于战前的二倍半。这种惊人的进展，使得主要食物及其产品的消费量可能增加百分之五十到百分之一百。
    阿尔巴尼亚已经永远摆脱了贫困落后的现象，而走上了繁荣、幸福的建设社会主义的道路。
