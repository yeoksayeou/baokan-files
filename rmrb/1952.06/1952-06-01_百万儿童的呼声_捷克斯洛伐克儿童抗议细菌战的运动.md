    The Voices of a Million Children
    --The Czechoslovakian Children's Movement Against Germ Warfare
    When the first batch of germ-carrying vermin—the propagators of American "culture"—began to be scattered on Korean soil, everyone was shocked. Modern doctors and scientists have waged a long-term struggle to eliminate vermin and disease, but now some beings called "humans" are deliberately spreading germs. This seems unbelievable. But American germ bombs were not only dropped one after another on Korea, but also on Chinese territory. It sounded an alarm to all honest people: we must actively defend the safety of mankind.
    In Czechoslovakia, protests against germ warfare flew in like snowflakes, and people signed everywhere, expressing their determination to intensify work to strengthen the forces of the peace camp and to donate materials and money to support the Korean people.
    On March 17, the Young Pioneers of the Stalin Elementary School in Prague issued a call to children all over the world, calling on everyone to protest against the barbaric acts of American imperialism. Student representatives from nearby schools sent in student protests. Schools from afar continued to send telegrams and letters. Letters poured in from all directions to the radio station. By March 20, the radio station broadcasted the news to the world that it had received 183,719 protest letters from children. New letters were still being added every day. In just twenty-two days, the number of Czechoslovakian children who signed protests against germ warfare reached one million.
    These letters indicate that millions of Czechoslovakian children sympathize with the tragic fate of their Korean brothers and sisters. In these letters, in addition to writing down their words of indignation and hatred towards imperialism, many children spent a great deal of effort using their naive language and artistic talents to express their support for their Korean brothers and sisters, and tried their best to alleviate their sorrow and suffering. Many protest letters are decorated with peace doves and surrounded by ribbons. To comfort the Korean orphans, the children put their most beloved toys—balls, dolls, and toy cars—into the paintings. Many children in Czechoslovakia have personally experienced the horrors of war, so their letters are full of moving emotions and understanding. Kolomanchekova, a young pioneer from Olomouc, wrote:
    "I lost a younger brother in the war. He loved going to school very much, but because of the lack of medical assistance at the time, he had to die. I hope all the children will unite with their mothers to stop the war. I am sick and cannot go to school, but I like to share my medicines with the Korean children."
    In order to make the Korean children happy, many colorful picture books were bound in Czechoslovakian schools. The children drew many spring-filled meadows and gardens to replace those destroyed by the American barbarians. Today, these are just flowers and palaces drawn by a million pairs of soft children's hands, still holding pens and pencils and learning; tomorrow, these many hands will become a powerful force, opening up fertile fields in the wilderness, directing machines in factories, and guiding rivers to serve mankind. These many hands will also help the Korean people rebuild what was destroyed by the American barbarians.
    Czechoslovakian children know that children in China, the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, France, and many other countries are protesting against American atrocities. Their young hands will also become strong. Moreover, hundreds of millions of hands of workers, farmers, teachers, and scientists will suppress the bloody hands of imperialism with steel-like strength and eliminate the creators of the plague. Such an opportunity is not far away. In the future, the children's sun and happiness will be guaranteed. (Translated by Tao Ran)

    百万儿童的呼声
    ——捷克斯洛伐克儿童抗议细菌战的运动
    当第一批带着细菌的毒虫——美国“文化”的传布者——开始撒布在朝鲜国土上的时候，所有的人们都惊愕了。近世的医生和科学家们曾经为消灭毒虫、疾病进行过长期的斗争，但如今却有些被称为“人”的东西竟在处心积虑地撒播细菌。这件事似乎叫人不敢相信。可是美国的细菌弹不仅接二连三地投在朝鲜，而且也投到了中国境内。它向一切正直的人们发出了警报：必须积极起来保卫人类的安全。
    在捷克斯洛伐克，反对细菌战的抗议书像雪片似地飞来，到处有人签名，表示要为加强和平阵营的力量而加紧工作，要捐赠物资和金钱来支援朝鲜人民。
    三月十七日，布拉格市斯大林小学的少年先锋队向全世界的小朋友发出呼吁，号召大家抗议美帝国主义的野蛮行为。附近学校的学生代表送来了学生们的抗议书。远地学校则不断地发来电报和信件。书信从四面八方送到广播电台。到三月二十日，电台向全世界播出了收到儿童们十八万三千七百一十九封抗议书的消息。新的书信还在每天增加。仅仅二十二天，签名抗议细菌战的捷克斯洛伐克儿童人数就达到了一百万。
    这些信件表示，成百万的捷克斯洛伐克儿童，都在同情着朝鲜兄弟姊妹的悲惨命运。在这些信件里，儿童们除了写下他们对帝国主义的愤慨和憎恨的言词之外，还有许多人花了很大气力运用他们天真的语言和艺术才能，表示他们对朝鲜兄弟姊妹的声援，并尽量希望能够减轻他们的悲哀和苦难。许多抗议书是用和平鸽子为装饰，四周用彩带围起来。孩子们为了安慰朝鲜的孤儿，把自己最心爱的玩具——皮球、洋娃娃和小汽车放进画中去。捷克斯洛伐克的孩子们有许多曾亲身经历过战争的恐怖，因此他们的书信里充满了动人的感情和理解。阿罗木次的女少年先锋队员柯罗曼切柯娃写道：
    “在战争中我失掉了一个弟弟，他是非常喜欢上学校去的；可是因为当时缺乏医生的帮助，他不得不死去。我希望所有的孩子们都同自己的母亲团结在一起，制止战争。我正在生病，我不能上学校去，但是我喜欢跟朝鲜的孩子们分用我的医药用品。”
    为使朝鲜的儿童们心里快乐，在捷克斯洛伐克的学校里，许多五颜六色的图画册被装订出来了。孩子们绘上许多春风荡漾的草地和花园，用以代替被美国野蛮人毁掉了的。今天，这还不过是一百万双柔软的儿童的手，还握着钢笔和铅笔在学习的手所绘出的花朵和宫殿；明天，这许多手就会变成强大的力量，在荒野里开辟良田，在工厂里指挥机器，引导河流为人类服务。这许多手也将帮助朝鲜人民重新建设被美国野蛮人所毁掉了的东西。
    捷克斯洛伐克儿童知道，在中国、苏联、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、德国、法国和别的许多国家的儿童们，都抗议美国的暴行。他们幼小的手也同样会变得坚强起来。而且，亿万双工人、农民、教师和科学家的手，将以钢铁般的力量，压制住帝国主义的血手，消灭瘟疫的制造者。这样的时机不远了。以后，孩子们的太阳和幸福就会得到保证。（陶然译）
