    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 21st: Ending the atrocities committed by the American aggressors on Geoje Island – this is the unanimous demand expressed by the Soviet people in mass rallies held throughout the Soviet Union.
    In Balkhash, Kazakhstan, a city-wide protest meeting was held. A Stakhanovite worker from a copper factory, Makayev, said at the meeting: "We protest against the torture inflicted by the American military on Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. We, along with all the Soviet people, demand that the aggressors be stopped and the war criminals be severely punished."
    More than seven hundred collective farm peasants and agricultural machinery drivers participated in a meeting held at the cultural palace of the Lochi Vostoga Collective Farm in Almaty Oblast. Like all the Soviet people, they expressed their angry protests against the crimes of the American invading army in Korea.
    Mass rallies were also held in the Soviet Baltic republics. A worker from the Klaipeda commercial port, Gerkis, said: "The whole world, the whole of progressive humanity, is shocked by the bloody acts of the American imperialists in Korea. The Soviet people, leading the fighters for peace, demand that the American cannibals be immediately restrained." A weaver from the "Punane Koit" textile factory, Sialer, said: "The Estonian people, who dedicate their heart and soul to strengthening the work of peace, denounce the shameful and bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea. The American bandits have violated the principles of international law and turned Geoje Island into a chamber of terror. These beastly executioners must be severely punished."
    Muslims in the Central Asian and Kazakh Republics held protest rallies in various mosques. A speech by Babakhan, member of the Soviet Peace Committee and chairman of the Religious Administration of Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan, on the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea was read at the meetings.

    苏联人民继续抗议美军在巨济岛的暴行
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：结束美国侵略者在巨济岛上的暴行——这是苏联人民在全苏各地举行的群众集会上表示的一致要求。
    哈萨克共和国巴尔喀什城举行了一个全城抗议集会，一家铜工厂的一名斯塔哈诺夫工作者马卡叶夫在会上说：“我们抗议美国军方对朝中战俘施行酷刑。我们和全苏人民一道要求制止侵略者，严厉惩办战犯。”
    七百多名集体农场农民和农业机械驾驶者参加了在阿拉木图州洛赤·伏斯多加集体农场文化宫举行的集会。他们和全苏人民一样，对美国侵略军在朝鲜的罪行表示愤怒的抗议。
    苏联波罗的海各共和国也举行了群众集会。克莱帕达商港的一名工人格尔基斯说：“整个世界、整个进步人类都为美帝国主义者在朝鲜的血腥行为所震惊。领导着和平战士的苏联人民要求立即抑制住美国吃人的野蛮人。”“普纳涅·柯伊特”纺织厂的一名织布工人西阿列尔说：“把全心全力献给加强和平的工作的爱沙尼亚人民，痛斥美国侵略者在朝鲜做出的可耻的血腥罪行。美国匪徒违反国际法的原则，把巨济岛变成了一个恐怖的刑室。必须严厉惩办这些禽兽般的刽子手。”

    巴巴汗是在第利亚·谢克寺院举行的祈祷会中发表这篇演说的，参加这个大会的，有将近五千人。安集延、撒马尔罕、浩罕、乌尔金赤、阿拉木图及其他城市的回教寺院里也都举行了盛大集会，参加的回教徒极为踊跃。
