Comrades, parents of children, dear children!

Today is International Children's Day, and children all over the world are enthusiastically celebrating their festival. But this day is also of equal importance to us – the fathers and mothers of children, young people, middle-aged people, old people, workers in various positions, especially those responsible for children's protection, welfare, and education. Because the happiness of children depends on the efforts of us people. Therefore, every year on Children's Day, children hold meetings to celebrate, and we must also hold meetings, on the one hand to celebrate the children's festival, and on the other hand to check whether we have done a good job in children's work.

This year's International Children's Day comes shortly after the successful conclusion of the International Conference for the Defence of Children. Representatives from dozens of countries participated in this conference and made many resolutions on issues related to the protection of children. Everyone has a consensus view and belief on these issues. This year we are celebrating Children's Day, so we should celebrate it even more enthusiastically. We also celebrate the victorious success of the International Conference for the Defence of Children.

There are two major camps in the world today: one is striving for peace, and the other is launching wars. Children in these two major camps also live two different lives. In imperialist and colonial and semi-colonial countries, children face the fate of hunger, ignorance, and death. For example, unemployed workers in the United States sell their children as commodities because of poverty; the mortality rate of children in Sudan is as high as 50 percent; juvenile prisons in Greece hold 15,000 children who are being tortured and living a hellish life; the British, American, and French imperialist governments desperately increase military spending, causing the people to bear an excessive burden of taxes, deteriorating the health of children, increasing mortality rates, and continuously reducing the population reproduction rate. A large number of children are forced to drop out of school, and some are even made into "criminals." In the peace camp, the situation is exactly the opposite. In the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, as the cause of peaceful construction is strengthened day by day and production is increased day by day, children's welfare is also being improved day by day. For example, in the Soviet Union, we have personally seen that children have the qualifications to go to school and study, and the government rewards mothers for having more babies. The output of infants can increase to three million every year, and therefore, many "model mothers" and "hero mothers" have emerged. Soviet society pays great attention to family life, and the birth of every infant is a great joy for the mother and the family.

In our Chinese New Democratic country, we care very much for children. In law, the Common Program and the New Marriage Law stipulate various rights related to children's lives and education. For the past two years, people's governments at all levels have conscientiously implemented the Marriage Law and have carried out resolute struggles against abortion, infanticide, early marriage, abuse and murder of child brides, and other crimes that physically and mentally harm children. Those lawbreakers who still dare to abuse and kill infants and children have been given severe legal sanctions. People's courts at all levels have implemented the policy of protecting the interests of children in handling marriage cases, and have striven for the due rights for those illegitimate children who have always been insulted and harmed by the old society. Moreover, our government is still constantly striving to eliminate feudal remnants, change social customs, and create good conditions for the life and growth of children in New China. On the other hand, we can also see that since liberation, the opportunities for children in New China to study have increased, health facilities have been gradually improved, and nurseries and kindergartens have been established more universally. The living standards of children in ethnic minority areas have also been greatly improved compared with before.

The above facts show that due to the different political systems of countries, the lives of children are also obviously different. Who is happy? Who is in pain? Parents should see it most clearly. In order to protect the happiness of our children, we must protect our political system, protect our country, and promote the superiority of our people's democratic dictatorship system. At the same time, we must wage a relentless struggle against those domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries who attempt to undermine our political system and invade our motherland. This is not the responsibility of children, but our responsibility.

I hear children everywhere singing the "Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers," and they like to sing this song for a reason. Just like you parents, when you were children two or thirty years ago, you had the same feeling when you sang the song "Down with the Japanese devils." This feeling is completely understandable. Another fact can also illustrate: Since the US imperialists launched germ warfare in Korea and China, school children in Beijing and other places have launched a campaign to clean up hygiene, catch flies and rats. Many children work hard to kill flies on Sundays, some killing hundreds of flies a day. We are very touched by these small things. How much they hate and abhor US imperialism. Yes, US imperialism is the mortal enemy of mankind, and even more so the mortal enemy of children all over the world. Wherever they exist, the happiness of children is threatened and harmed. Let us see what kind of education American children receive? What kind of life do they live? How are Korean children slaughtered by the American imperialist bandits? In many countries under its control, what is there besides hunger and death for children? Parents should see this very clearly. From the hearts of the children, from these bloody facts, we have found the truth. For the happiness of our own children, for the sake of saving the happiness of those children in the world who are being harmed by US imperialism, "Down with the American wolfish ambitions" is a righteous major event for us today. This is not the responsibility of the next generation, but the responsibility of our generation.

In our country, since liberation, there have been amazing achievements in children's education and welfare. I have briefly introduced it earlier. But we cannot be satisfied with the current living standards of children, we must strive for a better life for children. In order to do this work well, first of all, I would like to propose that each of us must have sufficient ideological preparation, in other words, we ourselves must strengthen learning and earnestly carry out our own ideological transformation.

We all say: "Children are the future of mankind." Yes, that's right. Our future is a prosperous and happy socialist and communist society, and children are the masters of the future society. In order to build our future, we should prepare some necessary conditions today, not only materially but also ideologically.

Comrades! Parents of children, most of us parents come from the old society and bring more or less some ideological remnants of the old society. We know that these remnants are not allowed to exist in the future society. Therefore, we must not pass these remnants on to our next generation and let them bring them into the future society. This is an extremely important reason why each of us engaged in children's education and welfare work, as well as each child's parents, should carry out ideological transformation.

Today, each of us has the right to protect our children from any infringement, but we should also pay attention not to infringe on our children with our own toxic ideas of the old society. To cultivate our children to develop noble qualities such as love for the motherland, love for the people, and love for labor, and a kind human nature, then first of all, we ourselves must make great efforts in this regard, exercise ourselves, and transform ourselves. I can say this: We participate in this ideological transformation movement for ourselves, our children, and our beautiful future.

Comrades! Parents of children! If we want our children to always live a happy life, then there must be a peaceful environment, otherwise, happiness is not guaranteed. We parents can be said to have been through scenes of war for a long time, and we have all personally seen how many orphaned and lonely children are caused after each war. War is cruel to mankind, especially cruel to children. Today we are fortunate that our country has achieved peace, and children can live a happy life. But we must recognize that China's peace is inseparable from world peace. Only by striving for world peace can there be lasting peace. For our children, for the children of the world, we must oppose the new war that US imperialism is creating. Only when kind parents all over the world unite to oppose war can there be a real guarantee of lasting peace. War is the enemy of peace, and also the enemy of children.

Today, celebrating International Children's Day, I hope that parents of children, on the one hand, use patriotism and internationalism education to educate our children; on the other hand, we must take action in various positions to defend our motherland, strive for lasting world peace, and strive to build a prosperous, happy, peaceful, and free beautiful future - a socialist society!

I wish progress and health to the children and parents of children in our democratic and united big family!

### 为儿童们更美满的生活而努力——“六一”国际儿童节在中山公园游园会上的讲话

    为儿童们更美满的生活而努力
    ——“六一”国际儿童节在中山公园游园会上的讲话
    沈钧儒同志们，儿童的家长们，亲爱的小朋友们！
    今天是国际儿童节，全世界儿童都在热烈地庆祝自己的佳节。但这一天对于我们—儿童的父亲和母亲、青年人、中年人、老年人、在各种岗位的工作者，尤其是负责儿童保卫、福利、教育的工作者，也有同样的重要意义。因为儿童的幸福是要靠我们这些人去努力的。所以，每年到儿童节的时候，儿童们开会庆祝，我们也要开会，一面庆祝儿童们的节日，一面要检查自己有没有做好儿童工作。
    今年的国际儿童节，正当国际保卫儿童大会胜利闭幕不久。在这次大会上，有几十个国家的代表参加，作了许多关于保卫儿童问题的决议，在这些问题上大家有了一致的看法和信念。今年我们庆祝儿童节，所以更应该热热烈烈。我们同时也庆祝国际保卫儿童大会的胜利成功。
    现在世界上存在着两大阵营：一面是在争取和平，一面是在发动战争。在这两大阵营里的儿童们，也过着两种不同的生活。在帝国主义及殖民地半殖民地国家里，儿童们遭遇着饥饿、愚昧、死亡的命运。例如：美国失业的工人们，因为穷困把儿童当成了商品出卖；苏丹儿童的死亡率高达百分之五十；希腊少年监狱里关着一万五千名儿童，他们正在受着折磨过着地狱的生活；英、美、法帝国主义政府，拚命地增加军费，使人民捐税担负过重，儿童健康状况恶化，死亡率提高，人口繁殖率不断降低，大量儿童被迫失学，甚至被造成“罪犯”。在和平阵营里，情况恰恰相反，苏联、中国以及人民民主国家，由于和平建设事业一天天地增强，生产一天天地提高，儿童福利也在一天天地改进，例如在苏联我们亲眼看到的，儿童都有了入学读书的资格，政府奖励母亲们多生娃娃，婴儿的产量每年可增加到三百万数字，因此也出现了不少“母亲模范”和“母亲英雄”。苏联社会很注意家庭的生活，每一个婴儿的诞生，对于母亲和家庭都是极大的快乐。
    在我们中国新民主主义的国家里，对于儿童是非常关怀爱护的。在法律上，共同纲领及新婚姻法规定了有关儿童的生命、教育等种种权利。两年来各级人民政府认真地执行婚姻法，对于坠胎、溺婴、早婚、虐待杀害童养媳，及其他在身体上精神上残害儿童的罪行，进行了坚决的斗争。对于仍然敢于虐杀残害婴儿和儿童的不法分子，给了他们以严厉的法律制裁。各级人民法院在处理婚姻案件中，贯彻了保护子女利益的政策，并为那些一向被旧社会侮辱与损害的非婚生子，争得了应有的权利。而且，我们的政府，仍在不断地努力消灭封建残余，改变社会风气，给新中国的儿童创设了生活与生长的良好条件。在另一方面，我们也可以看到，解放以来，新中国的儿童读书的机会增加了，卫生设备逐步改善了，托儿所、保育院，更加普遍地创办起来了，少数民族地区的儿童生活水准，也比以前大大地提高了。
    以上这些事实说明，由于国家政治制度的不同，儿童生活也是显然不同的。谁是幸福的？谁是痛苦的？做父母的应该看得最清楚了。我们为了保卫儿童们的幸福，我们就必须保卫我们的政治制度，保卫我们的国家，发扬我们人民民主专政制度的优越性。同时，我们必须对那些企图破坏我们政治制度，侵略我们祖国的国内外反革命分子，展开无情的斗争。这不是儿童的责任，而是我们的责任。
    我到处听到儿童们唱着“中国人民志愿军战歌”这支歌，他们喜欢唱这支歌是有道理的。就像各位家长们，你们在二三十年以前的儿童时代，唱“打倒日本鬼子”歌曲一样的心情，这种心情是完全可以理解的。从另一个事实也可以说明：自从美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国发动细菌战以后，北京及其他各地的学校儿童发起了清洁卫生，捕苍蝇、捉老鼠的运动。许多儿童在星期天努力地捕杀苍蝇，有的一天捕杀几百只。从这些小事，使我们很受感动。他们是如何的仇视和憎恨美帝国主义。是的，美帝国主义是人类的死敌，更是全世界儿童的死敌。他们存在的地方，儿童们的幸福就受到威胁和残害。我们看看美国的儿童，他们受的是什么教育？过的是什么生活？朝鲜的儿童是怎样被美帝国主义强盗们所屠杀的？在它所管制下的许多国家里，除了给儿童们饥饿和死亡以外，还有什么呢？这一点，做父亲母亲的应该看得很清楚。从儿童们的心情上，从这些血的事实上，我们找到了真理。为了自己的孩子们的幸福，为了拯救世界上那些在美帝国主义残害下的孩子们的幸福，“打倒美国野心狼”是我们今天天经地义的一件大事。这不是下一代的责任，而是我们这一代的责任。
    在我们国内，解放以来，对儿童教育福利事业确有惊人的成绩。前面我已经简单地介绍过了。但我们不能满足于现在的儿童生活水准，必须为儿童的更美满的生活而努力。为了做好这一项的工作，首先我想提出一点，就是我们每个人必须要有足够的思想准备，换一句话说，就是我们本身必须加强学习，认真地进行自己的思想改造。
    我们都这样说：“儿童是人类的未来”。是的，一点不错。我们的未来，就是繁荣、幸福的社会主义和共产主义的社会，儿童就是未来社会的主人。为了建设我们的未来，我们就应该在今天准备一些不但在物质上，而且在思想上的必要条件。
    同志们！儿童的家长们，我们这些做父母的人们，大都是来自旧社会，或多或少地带来一些旧社会的思想残余。我们知道，这些残余在未来的社会里是不容许存在的。因此，我们决不能够把这些残余传给我们的下一代，叫他们带到未来的社会里去。这就是我们每个从事儿童教育、福利工作者，以及每个儿童的父母们，为什么要进行思想改造的一个极其重要的理由。
    今天，我们每个人都有权利保卫自己的孩子不受任何侵害，但是我们也应该注意，不要用自己旧社会有毒素的思想来侵害孩子。要叫我们的孩子养成爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动这种高贵的品质和善良的人性，那么首先就要我们自己在这方面痛下功夫，锻炼自己，改造自己。我可以这样说：我们参加这次思想改造运动，是为了我们自己、我们的孩子以及我们美好的未来。
    同志们！儿童的家长们！要想叫我们的孩子永远过着幸福的生活，那就必须有个和平的环境，否则，幸福是毫无保障的。我们这些做父母的，可以说久经战争的场面了，我们都亲眼看到，每次战争以后，不晓得造成了多少孤苦零丁的孩子。战争对于人类是残酷的，对于儿童尤其残酷。今天我们庆幸我们的国家已取得了和平，儿童们可以过着幸福快乐的日子。但我们必须认清，中国的和平，和世界的和平是分不开的。只有争取到世界的和平才是永久的和平。为了我们的孩子，为了全世界的孩子们，我们必须反对美帝国主义正在制造的新的战争。全世界善良的父母们一致起来反对战争，永久和平才有真正的保障。战争是和平的敌人，也就是儿童的敌人。
    今天庆祝国际儿童节，我希望儿童的家长们，一面用爱国主义和国际主义教育，教育我们的儿童；一面我们要在各种不同的岗位上用行动保卫我们的祖国，争取世界永久和平，为建设繁荣、幸福、和平、自由的美好未来——社会主义社会而奋斗吧！
    我祝我们民主团结的大家庭里的儿童们和儿童的家长们的进步和健康！
