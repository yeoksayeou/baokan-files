Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union and Implementing the Rapid Tunneling Method
Cui Guoshan Team Improves Tunneling Efficiency by More Than Two Times
Poses Six Competition Conditions to Challenge Tunneling Workers in Northeast China
    The Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team of the Hengshan Coal Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improved labor organization and operational methods, and implemented the rapid tunneling method, increasing tunneling efficiency by more than two times.
    The Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team consists of sixty-seven people, including those involved in tunneling, shoring, hauling, and coal loading. After its establishment in October 1951, the team actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Guolovin Tunneling Team, considering the relatively poor coal seam conditions in Northeast China and the relatively complex composition of tunneling teams. They implemented a three-shift rotational rest system, conducting multi-lane operations simultaneously for double-track roadways, inclines, and level drifts. In the past six months, the Cui Guoshan Team has continuously set new tunneling records, and on April 30th, it set the highest Northeast China coal seam tunneling record of 44.95 meters in one day and 703 meters in one month (including 263 meters of roadway tunneling). The roadway tunneling speed increased by 233 percent compared to the average daily efficiency.
    In the early days of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team, because the personnel in each roadway were not fixed and the level drifts were relatively difficult to work on, everyone was willing to work on the roadways and inclines, causing the progress of the level drifts to often lag behind the progress of the roadways and affecting the overall tunneling efficiency. To overcome this shortcoming, they rationally allocated personnel to the three roadways according to the complexity of the work and adopted the approach of "fixed personnel, fluid technology." For example, roadway tunneling workers were fixed in roadway tunneling, but technical operations were not fixed. After blasting, blasting workers would perform tasks such as pushing carts or setting roof beams. This fully utilized time and manpower, allowing for three rounds of drilling and blasting, or even four rounds, in each shift, greatly accelerating the tunneling progress. In contrast, ordinary tunneling teams could only blast once per shift, resulting in very slow tunneling speeds.
    In the past six months, the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team has also continuously improved technology and operational methods based on on-site conditions and construction plans, improving wherever there were shortcomings. For example, in the past, after each blasting, the coal in the middle would not come down, or the bottom holes would only collapse into small pits, often leaving 15 or 16 centimeters of bottom coal. This not only increased the time spent on cleaning up the site but also hindered the continuous operation of drilling and blasting. After several studies, they improved the distribution of top, cut, and bottom holes, the selection of positions, and the size of angles, eliminating the phenomenon of leaving bottom coal and fully exploiting the blasting power of the explosives. At the same time, the depth of the drilled holes was increased from 1.5 meters to 1.8 meters, creating a record of advancing 1.9 meters per blast. While improving the drilling methods, the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team also changed the past practice of not blasting roadways and inclines simultaneously, based on the different situations of coal loading by coal loaders and manual coal loading, so that the coal loader could load the roadway coal and then load the incline coal, fully exploiting the efficiency of the coal loader. In addition, the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team also improved the method of setting roof supports, shortening the time from more than one hour per support to twenty-five minutes per support. This also played a significant role in accelerating the tunneling speed.
    Based on the principle of "fixed personnel, fluid technology," the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team used the method of ensuring more drilling and more blasting to achieve the goal of rapid tunneling. This advanced experience is most effective when geological conditions are poor, there are many types of work in the tunneling team, and there are many difficulties in coordinating between work types, utilizing manpower, and allocating time when conducting multi-lane cyclic operations. It is also effective for single-lane tunneling where cyclic operations are not possible.
    After setting a plan to increase production and save 1,398 tons of grain for the whole year, the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team proposed six competition conditions to challenge all tunneling workers in Northeast China. Their challenge letter is as follows: To all brother mining tunneling teams and tunneling groups in Northeast China:
    In order to respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Chairman Gao Gang for increasing production and practicing economy, we hereby propose the following six friendly competition conditions to you:
    1. Guarantee to work according to the construction plan, improve work efficiency and project quality, and exceed the plan by 20 percent. (Multi-lane coal roadways advance 860 meters per month.)
    2. Study technology, improve mechanical efficiency, strengthen labor organization, and improve drilling and blasting methods.
    3. Further strengthen safe operations, achieve safety for everyone and safety everywhere, and prevent minor injury accidents.
    4. Except for rotational rest, attendance rate reaches 100 percent.
    5. Strengthen the unity of the whole team, further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promote advanced experience.
    6. Study culture, politics, and business for one to two hours every day.

    学习苏联先进经验实行快速掘进法
    崔国山队提高掘进效率两倍多
    提出六项竞赛条件向东北掘进工人挑战
    鸡西矿务局恒山煤矿崔国山掘进队学习苏联先进经验，改进劳动组织和操作方法，实行快速掘进法，使掘进效率提高两倍多。
    崔国山快速掘进队共六十七人，包括掘进、支柱、搬运、装煤机等工种。该队在一九五一年十月成立后，根据东北煤层条件较差，掘进队工种比较复杂的情况，积极学习苏联郭洛温掘进队的先进经验，实行了三班循环轮休制，进行双轨大巷、上山、顺洞同时掘进的多巷道作业。半年来崔国山队连续创造了掘进的新纪录，四月三十日又创日进四十四点九五公尺，月进七百零三公尺（其中大巷掘进二百六十三公尺）的东北煤层掘进最高纪录。大巷掘进速度比一般的平均日进效率提高百分之二百三十三。
    崔国山掘进队成立初期，因为各巷道的工作人员不固定，顺洞又比较难作，所以大家都愿意到大巷、上山工作，使顺洞掘进的进度经常跟不上大巷的进度而影响整个掘进效率。为了克服这个缺点，他们便把三个巷道的人员按工作的繁简做了合理的分配，采取了“人员固定，技术流动”的作法。如大巷掘进工固定在大巷掘进，但技术操作并不固定，放炮的工人放完炮后，就作推车或上棚梁等工作。这样就充分利用了时间和人力，使每一班时间内能打三遍眼，放三遍炮，甚至可以放四遍炮，大大加速了掘进进度。而一般的掘进小组一班只能放一次炮，故掘进速度很慢。
    崔国山掘进队半年来还根据现场情况和施工计划，不断地改进技术，改进操作方法，做到那里有缺点就改进那里。如过去每放一遍炮后，不是中间的煤不下来，就是底眼只崩出一个小窟窿，经常留下十五、六公分厚的底煤，这就不仅增加了刷场子的时间，而且妨碍了打眼放炮的连续作业。他们经过几次研究改进了顶眼、掏槽眼、底眼数目的分配，位置的选择，角度的大小等操作技术，便消灭了留底煤的现象，并充分发挥了炮的爆破力。同时打眼的深度也由一点五公尺加深到一点八公尺，创造了每遍炮前进一点九公尺的成绩。在改进打眼方法的同时，崔国山掘进队还根据装煤机装煤与人工装煤的不同情况，改变了过去大巷、上山不同时放炮的作法，使装煤机装大巷煤后，就可以接着装上山煤，充分发挥了装煤机的效能。另外，崔国山掘进队还改进了上棚子的方法，由过去一个多小时棚一架棚子缩短为二十五分钟棚一架棚子。这对加快掘进速度也起了很大作用。
    崔国山掘进队根据“人员固定，技术流动”的原则，用保证多打眼，多放炮的办法，达到快速掘进的目的。这一先进经验，在地质条件较差，掘进队的工种较多，进行多孔道循环作业时，工种间的联系，人力的利用和时间的支配上困难较多的情况下，采用最有效果。对于无法进行循环作业的单一巷道的掘进，同样也有效果。
    崔国山快速掘进队在订出全年增产节约一千三百九十八吨粮食的计划后，又提出六项竞赛条件，向全东北掘进工人挑战。其挑战书如下：全东北兄弟矿掘进队及掘进组同志：
    为了响应毛主席和高岗主席的增产节约号召，特向你们提出六项友谊竞赛条件如下：
    一、保证按施工计划作业，提高工作效率和工程质量，超过计划百分之二十。（煤巷多孔每月前进八百六十公尺。）
    二、钻研技术，提高机械效率，加强劳动力组织，改进打眼放炮方法。
    三、进一步加强安全作业，做到人人保安、处处保安，不出轻微伤事故。
    四、除轮休外，出勤率达到百分之百。
    五、加强全队的团结，进一步学习苏联先进经验并推广先进经验。
    六、每天学习一小时到二小时的文化、政治、业务。
