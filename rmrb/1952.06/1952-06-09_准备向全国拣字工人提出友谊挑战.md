    Preparing to Launch a Friendly Challenge to Typesetters Nationwide
    Editor: My typesetting method has been preliminarily promoted in various places. After I set the highest typesetting record, comrades from all over the country sent letters to congratulate me, and printing factories from various places also sent people to visit our factory. I feel very excited. But I know my achievements are still small, and I will continue to work hard to achieve greater results. The main reasons why I can typeset 3,600 characters per hour are: (1) changing from twenty-four trays to eighteen trays; (2) utilizing linked characters; (3) dividing labor with both hands and automatically moving the manuscript; (4) paying attention to typesetting movements and posture; and (5) concentrating during typesetting. Of course, the most important thing is the Party's cultivation and education of me.
    Now, I really need to understand the advanced production experience of other printing factories, especially the advanced experience in typesetting.
    I was honored to participate in the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations in Beijing this time. After returning to the factory, the workers proposed challenging typesetters in various places. We discussed it, and also studied it with the administrative and trade union leaders, and all felt that it would be beneficial to do so. On May 25th, we formulated a challenge plan, preparing to launch a friendly challenge to typesetters nationwide.

    准备向全国拣字工人提出友谊挑战
    编辑同志：我的拣字工作法已经在各地初步推广了。我创造了拣字最高纪录后，全国各地的同志来信祝贺我，各地印刷厂还派人来我厂参观。我觉得很兴奋。但我知道我的成就还小，我还要继续努力，争取更大的成绩。我所以能够每小时拣三千六百字，主要是因为：（一）改二十四盘为十八盘；（二）利用连串字；（三）两手分工，自动移稿；（四）注意拣字的动作和姿势；（五）拣字时思想集中。当然，最主要的还是因为党对我的培养和教育。
    现在，我很需要了解其他印刷厂的先进生产经验，尤其是拣字上的先进经验。
    我这次荣幸地参加了北京“五一”劳动节的观礼。回厂以后，工人们纷纷提出向各地拣字工人挑战的要求。我和大家琢磨了一下，又和行政、工会领导方面研究了，都认为这样做是有好处的。五月二十五日，我们拟定了挑战计划，准备向全国拣字工人提出友谊的挑战。
