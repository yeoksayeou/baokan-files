    Preparation Process of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital
    Li Huanshan, Deputy Director of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital, Dai Zhengqi
    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital was established in China by the Soviet Red Cross. In the spring of 1951, the Soviet Red Cross proposed to the Chinese Red Cross to establish a hospital in China to serve the Chinese people. The Chinese side expressed a warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude for this suggestion and decided to locate the hospital in Beijing. In the winter of 1951, Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, had preliminary discussions on this issue while passing through Moscow. On January 17, 1952, Bashkov, Vice Chairman of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, visited Beijing and made further preparations for the hospital. Subsequently, Vice President Shamov was responsible for the preparatory work. After more than three months of effort, the hospital finally opened.
    This is a small hospital with eighty beds (the new hospital will have two hundred beds), with an outpatient department. All equipment for the hospital is provided by the Soviet Union. The medical equipment is modern, with complete surgical instruments for all types of surgery and an X-ray indirect photography machine (capable of examining three hundred patients a day), an X-ray deep therapy machine, and the latest instruments such as vascular suture devices. In addition, dedicated ambulances, and even sofas and kitchen utensils for patients were brought in.
    Thirty-seven Soviet comrades were assigned to work in this hospital, including chief physicians in various departments, all of whom are specialized medical experts above the level of corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. They not only have rich clinical experience, but also have excellent teaching abilities. The hospital has departments of internal medicine, surgery, neurology, ophthalmology, dentistry, ENT, dermatology and venereology, gynecology, X-ray, physiotherapy, and pulmonary tuberculosis, with complete facilities such as laboratories and pharmacies.
    The hospital's most important task is to serve the Chinese people with modern medical technology, demonstrate advanced Soviet medical experience, and train new medical personnel. The hospital will also conduct certain work in studying new achievements in Chinese medicine and strengthening and consolidating the ties between Chinese and Soviet medical and health workers.
    The establishment of this hospital is of great political significance. It is mainly manifested in: (1) It shows the brotherly assistance and cooperation of the Soviet Red Cross to the Chinese Red Cross, and represents the friendship and concern of the Soviet people for the Chinese people, representing the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people. (2) This hospital will become a center for spreading new Soviet medical ideas and technologies, which will play a huge role in promoting China's medical innovation movement. (3) The sincere friendship and assistance of the Soviet Red Cross is a clear contrast to the aid methods of relief organizations manipulated by American imperialism in the past. The "United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund" transported goods worth US$100,000 (400,000 rubles) in 1948, of which 300 out of 800 boxes were paper towels. After delivery, they insisted on controlling the warehouse management rights, attempting to undermine our national sovereignty. The staff also demanded high living expenses. The Soviet comrades in our hospital, on the other hand, are wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people, and the equipment is handed over to us for disposal, with their salaries fully borne by themselves. They have no other requirements, are serious and responsible in their work, and take care of state property, even noticing a nail, a pile of waste paper, or a broken box. This socialist working method and style has a great influence and education on us.
    The hospital opened on the 19th. Looking back on the preparatory process over the past three months, we completed the renovation of the temporary hospital site in intense work; completed the design drawings of the new hospital site, and construction has begun; completed the renovation project of the experts' dormitory, and manufactured more than 1,500 pieces of furniture, and installed larger electrical equipment. All this should first of all thank the great friendship and sincere assistance of the Soviet people to the Chinese people, and thank all the working comrades of the Soviet Red Cross, who made thorough plans and arrangements for the hospital's personnel and equipment. In particular, Comrade Bashkov, Vice Chairman of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, personally came to Beijing to prepare everything for the hospital. We are grateful to Vice President Shamov and other Soviet comrades in the hospital, who carefully and comprehensively considered every aspect of the renovation project of the temporary hospital site during the preparation process, trying their best to take care of economy and suitability. Vice President Shamov directly led the preparatory work of the hospital. He not only paid attention to large-scale planning, but also specifically paid attention to some small things. Therefore, the hospital completed the work completely according to the expected goals. Secondly, we thank the responsible comrades, engineers, supervisors, and the broad masses of workers from the Beijing Construction Company, Beijing Timber Factory, Guanghua Timber Factory, Beijing Power Supply Bureau, Diplomatic Printing Factory, Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau, Beijing Municipal People's Government Personnel Bureau, and the Municipal Health Bureau for their support, especially the workers who worked overtime at night and day and night to complete the task on schedule. In our work, as long as we mentioned "this hospital is run by the Soviet Union, and it is serving the Chinese people," we immediately received extra positive support and immediately generated unimaginable strength. This shows the high degree of patriotism and internationalism of our people.
    Finally, it should be stated that the leaders of the Red Cross Society of China, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and other leading organs provided great guidance and assistance in handling certain principled issues and major difficulties during the preparation period of the hospital, so that the preparation work of the hospital was successfully completed. We would like to express our gratitude.

    北京苏联红十字医院筹备经过
    北京苏联红十字医院副院长  李幻山  戴正启
    北京苏联红十字医院，是苏联红十字会在我国设立的。一九五一年春，苏联红十字会向中国红十字会提出愿在我国设立一个医院来为中国人民服务。对这个建议，我国方面表示了热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢，并决定将医院设在北京。一九五一年冬，中国红十字会总会会长李德全路经莫斯科时，初步对这一问题进行了商谈。一九五二年一月十七日苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会副主席巴什科夫来北京访问时，对医院的问题有了进一步的准备，随即由沙莫夫副院长负责筹备工作。经过了三个多月的努力，医院终于开幕了。
    这是一个八十张床位的小型医院（新建医院是二百张床位），兼设门诊部。医院的全部设备由苏联负担，医疗设备都是现代化的，有可做一切手术的完备外科器械和X光间接摄影机（一天可检查三百个患者），X光深部治疗机和血管缝合器等最新式器械。除此之外，还把专用救护车，甚至沙发和病人的厨房用具也带来了。
    派到这个医院工作的苏联同志有三十七人，其中各科的主任医师，都是苏联科学院候补院士以上的专科医学家。他们不但有丰富的临床经验，而且有卓越的教学能力。这个医院分设内、外、神经、眼、牙、五官、皮肤花柳、妇、X光、理疗、肺结核等科，化验室、药房等设备俱全。
    医院最主要的任务是以现代医疗技术为中国人民服务和示范苏联医学方面的先进经验，培养新型医务人员。在研究中国医学上的新成就及加强和巩固中苏医疗卫生工作者的联系方面，医院也将要进行一定的工作。
    这个医院的成立是具有重大政治意义的。主要表现在：（一）表示了苏联红十字会对中国红十字会的兄弟般的援助与合作，而且代表着苏联人民对中国人民的友谊和关怀，代表着苏联人民伟大的国际主义精神。（二）这个医院将成为一个传播苏联新的医学思想和技术的中心，对中国医学革新运动将起巨大的推动作用。（三）苏联红十字会这种真诚的友谊与帮助的方式与过去美帝国主义操纵下的救济团体的援助方式适成一种明显的对比。“联合国国际儿童急救基金会”于一九四八年运来价值十万美元（四十万卢布）的物资，在八百箱物资中就有三百箱是擦手纸。运到后还要坚持掌握仓库管理权，企图破坏我国家主权。工作人员并要求高额的生活费。而我们医院的苏联同志则是全心全意为中国人民服务的，设备也交由我们处理，薪金完全由自己负担。他们没有任何其他要求，对工作认真负责一丝不苟，爱护国家财物，甚至连一个钉子、一堆废纸、一个破箱子都注意到。这种社会主义的工作方法和工作作风，给与我们很大的影响和教育。
    医院在十九日开幕了。回顾这三个多月的筹备过程，我们在紧张的工作中完成了临时医院院址的改建工作；完成了新医院院址的设计图样，并已开始动工；完成了专家宿舍修缮工程，以及制成一千五百余件家具，安装了较大的电力电气设备。这一切，首先应该感谢苏联人民对中国人民的伟大友谊和真诚援助，感谢苏联红十字会的全体工作同志们，他们为医院的人员和设备做了周密的计划和安排。尤其是苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会副主席巴什科夫同志，他曾亲自来北京为医院筹备一切。感谢沙莫夫副院长和医院的其他苏联同志，他们在筹备过程中，细致地全面地考虑临时院址改建工程中的每一个环节，尽量的照顾到节约和适用。沙莫夫副院长更是直接领导医院筹备工作。他不仅注意到大的计划方面，并且具体地注意到一些小事情，因此，医院完全按照预期的目标完成了工作。其次是北京建筑公司、北京木材厂、光华木材厂、北京电业局、外交印刷厂、北京市房地产管理局、北京市市政府人事局、卫生局的各位负责同志、工程师们、监工人员们、以及广大的工人同志对我们的支持，特别是工人同志们晚间加班，昼夜不休地按期完成了任务。我们在进行工作中，只要一提到“这个医院是苏联办的，她是为中国人民服务的”，便立刻会得到格外积极的支持，便立刻产生了不可想像的力量。这说明了我国人民所具有的高度爱国主义和国际主义精神。
    最后应该说明，中国红十字会总会、北京市人民政府以及其他领导机关的首长们，在医院筹备期间，在处理某些原则问题及较大困难方面，均给予很大的指示与帮助，使医院的筹备工作顺利完成，谨致谢意。
