Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th. At the plenary session of the delegations of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 12th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, strongly condemned the absurd argument of the other side that we were conducting propaganda and expanding the differences between the two sides. General Nam Il pointed out that our side has made many significant efforts to eliminate the differences between the two sides on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and has proposed a fair plan that would allow prisoners of war on both sides to return home immediately to live peaceful lives. Our plan not only fully complies with the spirit of the Geneva Convention, but is also a truly reasonable compromise plan, and therefore a plan that can solve the problem. However, the other side not only insisted on unilateral and unreasonable demands and never made any concessions, but also overturned its promises, attempting to forcibly detain prisoners of war, expanding the differences between the two sides that could have been narrowed. The other side's plan to detain prisoners of war completely violates the Geneva Convention, but the other side stubbornly repeats this illegal plan as "firm, final, and unchangeable," and openly declares that it will never make any concessions. General Nam Il sternly pointed out that such a dictatorial attitude is absolutely not allowed in equal negotiations between the two sides, and does not help solve the problem in the slightest. The next step in the armistice negotiations is entirely up to the other side.

General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

“The only difference between the two sides that is hindering the Korean armistice is the difference on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. Since the discussion of the fourth agenda item, our side has consistently strived to narrow the differences and negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis. However, in your speech yesterday, you actually said that our side is conducting propaganda and expanding the differences between the two sides. This is a complete distortion of the facts and a reversal of right and wrong. In fact, it is your side that is expanding the differences between the two sides. It is your side that is tearing up the Geneva Convention, insisting on unilateral and unreasonable plans, and refusing to negotiate; it is your side that is constantly proposing indefinite recesses and periodic recesses, evading meetings, and walking out midway; it is your side that is persecuting our captured personnel in every possible way and constantly massacring our captured personnel. Exposing the facts and upholding the truth will not expand the differences between the two sides. The responsibility for expanding the differences between the two sides, making it impossible to reach an armistice agreement, and preventing prisoners of war on both sides from returning home must be entirely borne by your side, which attempts to forcibly detain prisoners of war, makes no concessions, arbitrarily massacres prisoners of war, and refuses to make any explanation.

In order to eliminate the differences between the two sides and negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis, our side has made many significant efforts and proposed a fair plan that is most realistic. Foreign armed personnel (United Nations forces or Chinese People's Volunteers) captured by both sides should all be repatriated home; Korean armed personnel (South Korean army or Korean People's Army) captured by both sides whose homes are in the other side's area should all be repatriated home, and those whose homes are in the receiving side's area should be allowed to return home on the spot without repatriation. It must be emphasized that our May 2nd plan not only fully complies with the spirit of the Geneva Convention, but is also a truly reasonable compromise plan. This plan is fair to both sides, and therefore a plan that can solve the problem. However, your side has not only consistently insisted on your unilateral and unreasonable demands since the discussion of the issue of prisoner of war repatriation without making any concessions, but has also openly reneged on your promise to resolve the issue within the outline of your plan to repatriate our 132,000 prisoners of war, illegally announced the so-called "screening" of prisoners of war, forcibly detaining our captured personnel, and putting forward your April 28th plan. By doing so, your side has not only failed to strive to narrow the differences between the two sides, but has also expanded the differences that could have been narrowed. If your side had kept its promise, the issue of prisoner of war repatriation would not have developed to its current state. Now you are portraying the so-called joint re-screening as a concession on your part. You should know without any ambiguity that our side will not agree to the so-called re-screening, which fundamentally violates the Geneva Convention, under any circumstances. As long as your side insists on using any re-screening to block the door to solving the problem, it shows that your side still insists on expanding the differences between the two sides on that day and is unwilling to negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation.

Our side firmly believes that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is the issue of the commanders of both sides repatriating or detaining the prisoners of war they hold, and does not allow any excuse to obscure the truth of this issue. Our side insists on fair and reasonable agreements in equal negotiations between the two sides, which can only be reached through reasoning and consultation between the two sides. Any unilateral and unreasonable plan and dictatorial approach cannot solve the problem. Your irresponsible approach of refusing to reason, refusing to negotiate, and even refusing to meet does not help solve the problem in the slightest. In order to achieve a Korean armistice and negotiate a solution to the issue of prisoner of war repatriation on a reasonable basis, our side has made many efforts and proposed a practical and fair plan, which is a reasonable basis for solving the problem. The next step in the negotiations is up to your side. This is our side's firm position."

### 美方竟谓我方进行宣传扩大双方分歧  南日将军斥美方荒谬论点  指出美方拒绝协商无助于问题的解决

    美方竟谓我方进行宣传扩大双方分歧
    南日将军斥美方荒谬论点
    指出美方拒绝协商无助于问题的解决
    【新华社开城十二日电】十二日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军痛斥对方所谓我方进行宣传、扩大了双方分歧的荒谬论点。南日将军指出我方为消除双方在战俘遣返问题上的分歧，已经作了多次重大的努力，提出了使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活的公正方案。我方方案不但完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神，而且也是真正合理的折衷方案，因此是能解决问题的方案。但对方不仅坚持片面无理主张，从未作任何让步，而且推翻自己的诺言，企图强行扣留战俘，扩大了双方之间本来已经可能缩小的分歧。对方扣留战俘的方案，彻底违反了日内瓦公约，而对方却蛮横地重复这一非法方案是“坚定的、最后的、不可改变的”，公然宣称决不作任何让步。南日将军严词指出这种独断的态度是平等对待的双方谈判中所绝对不能容许的，是丝毫无助于问题的解决的。停战谈判的下一步完全在于对方。
    南日将军主要发言如下：
    “阻碍着朝鲜停战的双方唯一分歧是战俘遣返问题的分歧。我方自从讨论第四项议程以来，就一贯努力于缩小分歧，在合理的基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题。但你方在昨天的发言中竟说我方进行宣传，扩大了双方之间的分歧。这完全是歪曲事实，颠倒是非。事实上扩大双方之间的分歧者正是你方。是你方撕毁日内瓦公约，坚持片面无理的方案，拒绝进行协商；是你方不断提出无限期休会和定期休会，逃避会议，中途退席；是你方百般迫害我方被俘人员，不断屠杀我方被俘人员。揭发事实，坚持真理，并不能扩大双方之间的分歧。扩大双方之间的分歧，使停战不能达成协议，使双方战俘不能回家的责任，必须由企图强行扣留战俘，不作任何让步及恣意屠杀战俘，拒作任何交代的你方全部负担。
    为了消除双方之间的分歧，在合理的基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，我方作了多次的重大努力，提出了一个最切合实际的公平方案。双方所俘获的外国武装人员（联合国军或中国人民志愿军）应全部遣返回家；双方所俘获的朝鲜武装人员（南朝鲜军或朝鲜人民军）其家在对方地区者应全部遣返回家，其家在收容方面地区者，得许其就地回家，不必遣返。必须强调指出，我方五月二日方案不仅完全符合于日内瓦公约的精神，而且是一个真正合理的折衷方案。这个方案对于双方是公平的，因此是能够解决问题的方案。但你方不但自讨论战俘遣返问题以来始终坚持你方片面无理的主张，未作任何让步，而且公然背弃了你方愿在遣返我方十三万二千战俘方案轮廓内解决问题的你方诺言，非法宣布对战俘实行所谓‘甄别’，强行扣留我方被俘人员，提出你方四月二十八日方案。这样作你方不仅没有努力于双方分歧之缩小，而且是将本已可能缩小的分歧扩大了。如果你方信守你方的诺言，战俘遣返问题不可能发展到今天这样的状况。现在你方又把所谓共同再甄别说成是你方的一个让步，你方应该毫不含糊地知道我方在任何情况下都不会同意根本违反日内瓦公约的所谓再甄别的。只要有一天你方还坚持用什么再甄别来杜绝解决问题之门，那就表明你方那一天还坚持扩大双方之间的分歧，不愿协商解决战俘遣返问题。
    我方坚定不移地认为战俘遣返问题是双方司令官遣返其所拘留的战俘或者扣留其所拘留的战俘的问题，不容许用任何藉口来模糊这个问题的真相。我方坚持在双方平等的谈判中公平合理的协议，只有根据说理，经过双方的协商，才能达到。任何片面无理的方案和独断独行的做法，都不能解决问题。而你方拒绝说理，拒绝协商，甚至拒绝开会的不负责任的作法，是丝毫无助于问题的解决的。为了达成朝鲜停战在合理的基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，我方已经作了多次努力，提出了切合实际的公平方案，这是解决问题的合理基础。谈判的下一步在于你方。这是我方坚定不移的立场。”
