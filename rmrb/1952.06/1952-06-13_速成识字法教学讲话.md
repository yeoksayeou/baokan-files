Fourth Lecture: Rapidly Attack New Characters, First Aiming at Reading (Part 1)

After the vast majority of students have learned all the phonetic symbols and are proficient in Pinyin, the focus must shift to rapidly attacking new characters. This is the most intense stage of the quick literacy method.

When starting to attack new characters, the teacher's thinking must be clear: first use familiar characters to practice Pinyin in order to be able to pronounce new characters, laying the foundation for a large-scale assault on new characters. Before class, the teacher can use a battle as an example to conduct a brief and powerful mobilization, explaining that learning phonetic symbols and Pinyin is like preparation work before a battle, and now it is a formal entry into combat. Call on everyone to take a fighting stance of fierce attack and charge, and "eliminate" the more than two thousand new characters one by one. The teacher should also make requests based on the specific situation, such as: overcome difficulties without complaining, persevere to the end; unite and help each other, promote class friendship, and make progress together; obey commands, learn where you are taught, and learn as you are taught... Every comrade must be mentally prepared.

Attacking new characters is carried out using the "Phonetic Single Character List" as teaching material, one character per line. For each character, the teacher first leads the students in spelling and reading it two or three times, and then uses some simple, easy-to-understand explanations that are easily accepted by the students. In this way, the time required to teach fifty characters should not exceed fifteen minutes at most. After that, you can turn to group review, first requiring the ability to spell the characters learned, and then requiring the ability to read without the phonetic symbols. The review time is generally about twice the lecture time. After the review, if there are characters that are not recognized (i.e., so-called "troublemaker characters" or "weird characters"), they are concentrated and explained repeatedly. In this way, one class after another is used for assault and review, until the final review and test. This is the entire process of attacking new characters.

In this teaching process, the following points must be noted:

First, let's talk about how to explain characters. Students rely on three magic weapons to remember new characters: the first is phonetic symbols, which can help people spell out forgotten new characters; the second is to connect with life, using familiar everyday vocabulary to remember new characters; and the third is to figure out the appearance of the characters, decompose the shape of the characters, and use familiar characters to remember new characters. Therefore, when explaining characters, pay attention to: 1. Connect with the vocabulary and things that students are most familiar with; require simplicity and specificity; and at the same time, pay attention to the political meaning of each character, giving students a deep impression. For example, when explaining the "径" (jìng) character with the double-person radical, for soldiers, it is better to say "caliber of guns" than "path," because it is easier to understand and remember; it is better to explain the character "之" (zhī) as "home of glory" than "zhi hu zhe ye." This is the vocabulary of the students, easy to understand, and also has political significance. For characters that have several ways to explain them, only explain one. Explaining too many will only make students feel dizzy. Because the main purpose of attacking new characters is to achieve the goal of being able to read, the explanation is only to help memory (this work can be left to the stage of extensive reading later). For example, the character "长" (cháng) can only be explained as "班长" (bānzhǎng, squad leader) or "连长" (liánzhǎng, company commander). When encountering the character "长" connected with the character "江" (jiāng) in reading, students will naturally associate it with "班长" and can also pronounce it as "长江" (Chángjiāng, Yangtze River). 2. The explanation should be lively, vivid, and visualized. When explaining, the teacher should pay attention to expressions, movements, and connect with objects and diagrams. In the intense assault phase, some vivid and meaningful examples can be inserted, which can not only liven up the learning atmosphere, but also help memory. For example, when explaining the character "昂" (áng), you can read a sentence "雄赳赳，气昂昂" (xióngjiūjiū, qì ángáng, chest out, head high); when explaining the character "瞪" (dèng), the teacher can roll their eyes to express the meaning and pronunciation of the character. Sometimes, real objects and diagrams are also used. For example, when explaining the character "箔" (bó), a piece of tin foil is shown to the students. In addition, you can also say two sentences of clapper talk, tell a short story. However, the explanation time should not be too long, and even less should it be too far from the topic. Otherwise, sometimes students only remember the story and forget the explanation and pronunciation of the character. 3. After teaching five or six hundred characters, teach some radicals and components to induce students to figure out the shapes of the characters. For example, the "光" (guāng) radical plus a "军" (jūn) is the "辉" (huī) character in "光辉" (guānghuī, glory). However, it should also be noted that it should not be too abused, otherwise it will cause far-fetched phenomena. Breaking a character into two or three familiar characters is certainly helpful for memory, but if it is broken into several new characters, it will increase the burden on students. In addition, it can also be explained through students' associations, such as "羡慕" (xiànmù, envy). These two characters are abstract and difficult to explain. At this time, the teacher can ask the students to recall their feelings when they saw heroes and models at the hero model conference; they can also explain the words in conjunction with other words, such as when explaining "酬" (chóu), it can be connected to "酬谢" (chóuxiè, reward) and write it on the blackboard; they can also decompose the shape of the character, such as when explaining the character "歪" (wāi, crooked), explain that not being straight is "歪", and so on. Such methods can be used flexibly and appropriately, but should avoid vulgarization. In short, to explain new characters appropriately, teachers must abandon the vocabulary of intellectuals, earnestly learn from the soldiers, first be students, then be teachers, and come from the masses and return to the masses. Prepare carefully before class and understand the emotions of the soldiers. For pre-class preparation, it is best to absorb the opinions of some more advanced students.

Let's talk about how to grasp the progress. To implement the quick literacy method, on the one hand, we must oppose the conservative view of taking small steps; on the other hand, we must also prevent blindly launching a large-scale attack. The question of how many characters should be taught to students in a day should be determined based on the acceptance ability of most students. On this issue, some units only take activists as the standard and desperately attack new characters. As a result, too much is taught, and a large number of comrades cannot keep up, causing them to lose confidence in learning. Mutual aid activities cannot be carried out, and students also feel very tired. Some units have adopted the method of using students of medium level as the standard, and the results have been great. The whole class can progress together, and both teachers and students are relaxed and happy. In order to accurately grasp the progress, it is best to arrange classes according to the original literacy level of the students. The ability of students to accept new characters is generally inseparable from the amount of literacy they originally had. According to the investigations and studies of many units, people who only know less than two hundred characters can accept an average of 190 new characters per day (according to eight hours of class); people who know between two hundred and five hundred characters can accept an average of more than 240 characters per day; people who know five hundred to one thousand characters can accept an average of more than 380 characters per day. At the same time, the acceptance ability of students is constantly improving in the process of the assault. Therefore, it can be gradually increased from less to more. In the process of attacking new characters, teachers must always pay attention to the students' acceptance ability to determine the speed of progress.

That's all for today. Next time we will talk about how to pay attention to getting rid of phonetic symbols and organizing review and testing in the attack on new characters in order to consolidate the learned new characters.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第四讲    突击生字，先求会读（上）
    在绝大部分学员学会了全部注音符号，熟练了拼音之后，就要开始突击生字了。这是速成识字法教学中最紧张的一个阶段。
    开始突击生字时，教员的思想必须明确，先用熟字熟练拼音，以便拼读生字，给大量突击生字打下基础。上课前教员可以战斗为例，进行简短有力的鼓动，说明学注音符号和拼音有如战前的准备工作，现在是正式投入战斗了。号召大家以猛打猛冲的战斗姿态，将两千多个生字逐一加以“消灭”。教员并应根据具体情况提出要求，如：克服困难不叫苦，坚持到底；团结互助，发扬阶级友爱，共同进步；听从指挥，教到那里学到那里，怎样教便怎样学……要每个同志做好思想准备。
    突击生字是以“注音单字表”为教材，一字一行地进行。每个字先由教员领着拼，领着读两三遍，再用一些简明通俗、容易为学员所接受的解释加以说明。这样，教五十个字所需的时间最多不超过十五分钟。之后即可转入小组复习，首先要求能拼读学过的字，然后要求脱离注音符号读。复习的时间一般约为讲课时间的两倍。复习后有不认识的字
    （即所谓“捣蛋字”“古怪字”），集中起来再反复地进行讲解。这样，一堂课接着一堂课地进行突击、复习，直到总复习、测验。这就是突击生字的全部过程。
    在这个教学过程中，必须注意以下几点：
    先说怎样讲字。学员记生字，基本上依靠三件法宝：第一件是注音符号，它可以帮助人把忘了的生字拼出来；第二件是连系生活，利用熟悉的日常生活中常用的语汇来记住生字；第三件是捉摸字的模样，分解字形，运用熟字来记生字。所以，讲字就要注意：一、要联系学员最熟悉的语汇、事物；要求简单、具体；同时注意到每一个字的政治意义，给学员以深刻的印象。譬如讲双立人边的“径”字，对于战士来说，与其说“途径”的“径”，就不如说“枪炮口径”的“径”，因为这样容易懂，好记；把“之”字讲成“之乎者也”的“之”，就不如讲“光荣之家”的“之”字。这是学员的语汇，通俗易懂，同时也具有政治意义。对于有几种讲法的字，只讲一种就行，讲多了反而使学员感到头昏眼花。因为突击生字主要是为要达到会读的目的，讲解只是为了帮助记忆（这一工作可以留到以后大量阅读的阶段去解决）。如“长”字，只讲“班长”“连长”的“长”就可以，等到在阅读中遇到“长”字和“江”字连在一起的地方，学员自然会联想到“班长”的“长”，也可念成“长江”的“长”。二、讲解要生动、活泼、形象化。教员在讲解时，要注意到表情、动作，并联系实物及图示。在紧张的突击阶段，可以插入一些生动而有意义的例子，它既可活跃学习情绪，也可帮助记忆。如讲“昂”字，可以读一句“雄赳赳，气昂昂”；讲“瞪”字，教员可把眼一瞪，用表情来表现这个字的意义和读法。有时还利用实物和图示，如讲“箔”字，就拿一张锡箔给学员看。此外还可以说两句快板，讲个小故事。但讲解的时间不能太多，更不能离题太远。不然，有时学员只记住了故事，忘了字的讲法和读法。三、教五六百字以后，再教一些部首、偏旁，诱发学员捉摸字形。如“光”字旁加一个“军”就是“光辉”的“辉”字。但是，也要注意不能太滥，否则会引起牵强附会的现象。把一个字拆成两三个熟字，固然对记忆有帮助，但倘若拆成几个生字，就反而增加了学员的负担。另外，还可以通过学员的联想来讲解，如“羡慕”这两个字是抽象的字，不好讲解。这时教员就让学员回忆一下在英雄模范大会上自己看到英雄模范时的心情；也可以联词讲解，如讲“酬”时可联成“酬谢”，把它写在黑板上；也可以分解字形，如讲“歪”字，说明不正就是“歪”等等。诸如此类的办法，都可灵活、恰当地采用，但要避免流于庸俗化。总而言之，生字要讲解得恰当，教员必须抛开知识分子的那一套语汇，认真向战士们学习，先当学生，后当先生，从群众中来再回到群众中去。在课前要认真地准备，体会战士的情感。课前准备，最好能吸收一些程度较高的学员的意见。
    再讲怎样掌握进度。实施速成识字法教学，一方面要反对小手小脚的保守观点；另一方面，也要防止盲目地大量突击。关于学员一天该教多少字的问题，应该根据大多数学员的接受能力而定。在这问题上，有些单位只拿积极分子做标准，拼命突击生字，结果教的太多，大批同志跟不上，使他们对学习失掉信心；互助活动也无法开展，学员们也感到非常的疲劳。有些单位，采取以中等程度的学员为标准的办法，收效就很大，全班能齐头并进，而且教员和学员都很轻松、愉快。为了准确地掌握进度，最好按学员原有的识字程度分别编班上课。学员接受生字的能力，一般和原来识字的多少是分不开的。据许多单位的调查研究，在只认识二百字以下的人，每天（按八小时上课）平均可接受生字一百九十个；在认识二百到五百字的人，平均每天可接受二百四十多个字；认识五百字到一千字的人，平均每天可以接受三百八十多个字。同时，学员的接受能力，是在突击过程中不断提高的，因此，可以由少到多，逐渐地增加。教员在突击生字过程中，必须时刻注意到学员的接受能力，以确定进度的快慢。
    今天，先讲到这里为止。下一次我们要讲突击生字中如何注意撇开注音符号和组织复习、测验，以达到巩固地记住所学得的生字。
