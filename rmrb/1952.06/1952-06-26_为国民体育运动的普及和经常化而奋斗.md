    Strive for the Popularization and Regularization of National Sports
    Rong Gaotang
     I. Overview and Achievements of Sports Activities in the Past Two to Three Years
    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has been established for more than two years. We will officially establish the All-China Sports Federation at this conference. The formal establishment of the Federation will further strengthen the organized and led development of sports activities nationwide.

    In the past two or three years, under the care and leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the active support of relevant organizations and the efforts of sports workers, sports activities have gradually developed. While actively carrying out preparatory work, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has also done some necessary work in promoting national sports activities and has achieved some results. These achievements are mainly reflected in the following four aspects:

    (1) Expanded the publicity of national sports activities, established the correct direction of sports activities—to serve the people's health, national defense, and production construction, and began to establish a new collectivist moral style in sports activities. Participants in sports activities have initially recognized the scientific value of sports activities for physical exercise and the significant meaning for strengthening national defense and production construction through practical activities. Most athletes have demonstrated a spirit of collectivism characterized by being active, brave, united, friendly, not arrogant, not discouraged, obeying the organization, and observing discipline. Some athletes are also models of learning, work, production, and combat. The bad ideological style of selfishness, mutual attacks, deliberate injury, and pursuit of personal glory and championship, which existed in the old society, has been changed. Under the principle of spending little or no money, many places have mobilized voluntary labor and taken various measures to overcome the difficulties of insufficient sports grounds and equipment. These changes are important conditions for the widespread and correct development of sports activities. This is the result of the leadership, care, and constant education of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government.

    (2) Sports activities have broken through a relatively narrow scope and begun to develop among a wider range of people. The situation in the old society where sports served only a few people has changed. In order to promote and popularize sports activities, sports organizations across the country have assisted the People's Government in holding various large-scale sports meets. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three years, there have been more than 400 sports meets at or above the provincial and municipal levels, with nearly one million athletes participating. Some places have also held sports meets for workers, soldiers, students, and women separately. In 1951, the National Basketball, Volleyball, and Football Tournament was held, and sports achievements in various places are constantly improving. Last December, broadcast calisthenics were promoted nationwide. In schools, sports activities have gradually become regular and institutionalized. For example, in Beijing, more than 95 percent of college and middle school students regularly participate in sports activities. Cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have implemented the "Exercise Standard" system in some schools. This has played a certain role in improving students' health and ensuring their studies. Sports activities in the army have become more widespread than before and have become a regular part of regular training. In some factories and institutions, the gradual development of sports activities has played a positive role in physical exercise, improving labor and work efficiency, and enlivening life. Among workers nationwide, sports activities are more widespread and regular in the Northeast region and the railway system. In 1951, 200,000 railway workers participated in sports activities. In some rural areas that were liberated earlier and where land reform has been completed, folk sports activities have also developed.

    (3) The establishment of sports organizations at all levels and the transformation and training of sports cadres and activists have prepared some necessary conditions for the widespread development of sports activities in the future. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 268 sports organizations at or above the county level. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, sports organizations at all levels have promoted local sports activities, actively carried out ideological transformation work for sports workers, and regularly held study sessions—more than 40 times at or above the provincial and municipal levels in the past two years. In 1950, a national summer study session for sports workers was held. In particular, after the movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, donating airplanes and cannons, and the "Three-Anti" and ideological transformation, the ideology of the vast number of sports workers across the country has improved compared to before, and their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in their work have increased compared to before. Many sports organizations have also paid attention to the cultivation and training of a large number of activists emerging in sports activities, and have held various amateur sports short-term training courses. In Beijing and Tianjin, various amateur sports short-term training courses trained more than 2,000 amateur sports cadres in half a year. Although this is far from meeting the needs of current work, it has initially solved the problem of insufficient sports cadres.

    (4) In order to learn advanced Soviet sports theories and practical experience, and to strengthen friendship with sports workers and athletes from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has established close ties with sports organizations in the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and participated in international sports competitions for youth and students. We have successively sent basketball teams to participate in the 10th World Summer Universiade held in Budapest; sent basketball and volleyball teams to participate in the sports competitions of the Second World Student Congress held in Prague; sent sports delegations to the Soviet Union to study; sent basketball and volleyball teams to participate in the 11th World Summer Universiade held in Berlin; and the People's Liberation Army also sent a sports delegation to Czechoslovakia to participate in the sports celebration of the Czechoslovak Army Day. In December 1950, we also invited a Soviet sports delegation to visit and perform in China, which greatly encouraged the development of sports activities in our country and enabled our sports circles to actually contact and learn advanced Soviet sports. This July, Polish men's and women's basketball teams will visit China. The above are all good beginnings for national sports activities. There are still many shortcomings in the work of developing sports activities that need to be overcome urgently, and it is still lagging behind the actual needs.

    II. Future Sports Policies and Tasks
    Sports are a part of the New Democratic education. It can not only exercise the people's healthy bodies, but also cultivate the people's good qualities of courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, optimism, and collectivism, and be able to competently and persistently serve the construction and defense of the motherland. Therefore, developing sports activities has significant positive significance for national defense, production labor, and other construction. At present, the people of the whole country have invested in the great movement of increasing production and practicing economy. In order to actively carry out national defense construction and economic construction, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the role of sports activities is even more significant. At the same time, as the people's economic and cultural living standards gradually improve, sports activities will also develop rapidly.

    However, the large-scale economic construction of our motherland has just begun. In front of the people of the whole country, there are many complex, arduous, and urgent tasks that need to be completed. On the other hand, our country has a vast territory, complex situations, different times of liberation in different regions, and unbalanced economic development. There are also differences in the living conditions and production, work, and learning conditions of the people between cities and villages, schools, institutions, factories, and troops. At the same time, due to the long-term reactionary rule, the foundation of sports work in our country is relatively weak, and there are also insufficient sports cadres. Under such circumstances, the development of sports activities can only be a steady advance, and we cannot demand too much or be too hasty.

    Based on the above situation, our future work policy should be: on the existing basis, proceeding from reality and combining with reality, to popularize and regularize sports activities, and actively "develop sports activities and enhance the people's physique" to serve the strengthening of production construction and national defense construction.

    In order to implement this policy, vigorously developing regular and mass sports activities in basic units such as schools, institutions, factories, troops, and rural areas is the central task of current sports activities. To this end, it is necessary to:

        (1) Develop diverse forms of sports activities. All sports activities that are beneficial to physical health and are simple and easy to implement should be advocated and promoted. On the one hand, we will continue to develop projects such as gymnastics, track and field, ball games, swimming, and some military sports activities (such as grenade throwing, shooting, aviation models, etc.); at the same time, we must pay attention to those national sports forms that are familiar and loved by the masses (such as martial arts, wrestling, stone locks, sandbags, lifting stone shoulders, horizontal bars, horse riding, rope skipping, etc.), and improve them, remove their unscientific parts, and make them an effective form for widely developing sports activities among the working masses.

    (2) According to the actual conditions of each basic unit, carry out mass sports work in a planned and organized manner.

    In units where general sports conditions are not very adequate, we should widely carry out some simple, flexible, and combined with recreational sports activities, and first strive for the majority of people to participate in one or several sports activities. Through various sports activities, discover activists and organize them to form sports activity groups, so that sports activities become regular activities.

    In units with better conditions, we can select one or several sports activities to formulate appropriate exercise standards, implement the "Exercise Standard" system, organize participants into several "Exercise Groups," conduct regular exercise activities, and periodically summarize achievements. Those who have reached the prescribed standards will be given certain rewards. When implementing the "Exercise Standard" system, various localities can start with a few units and conduct pilot projects with key points based on the experience of Beijing and Shanghai. At the beginning, the exercise items should be fewer and the standards should be lower in order to attract and encourage the masses to actively participate. After gaining experience, gradually improve and promote it.

    For the masses with higher sports levels, we can organize them to form various sports groups or sports teams (such as basketball teams, volleyball teams, track and field teams, etc.), and stipulate the covenants for participating in sports and certain goals to encourage everyone to improve their skills and continuously influence and absorb new masses to participate.

        The "Preparation for Labor and Defense of the Motherland" sports system (referred to as the Labor-Defense System) is the basic system for implementing national sports in our country in the future. Its purpose is to popularize and regularly develop national sports activities and ensure that every citizen's body is fully exercised and fully developed. However, our country does not yet have the conditions to universally implement this system, so we propose to only conduct experiments in individual units in a few large cities in order to gain experience and prepare for future universal promotion.

        (3) Regularly holding sports competitions and sports meets plays an important role in popularizing sports activities and continuously improving them. Especially in basic units, regularly holding competitions in various sports separately is particularly important for encouraging the masses in this unit to participate in sports activities. Therefore, we should advocate and organize competitions in one or several sports within or between basic units. In addition, it is also important to regularly hold various sports competitions and national sports conferences according to region (large administrative region, province, city, county, district) and occupational system (railway, troops, students, etc.). However, sports conferences that are all-encompassing, with many items and groups, and have little effect should be held as little as possible. In order to develop sports activities more systematically, in the future, sports meets and various sports competitions should gradually form a system according to the season.

    In addition, there are several specific tasks:

        (1) It is also very important to regularly combine patriotic and collectivist ideological education among the masses to publicize the purpose, importance, policies, tasks, and new moral style of sports activities, and to generally introduce basic methods and knowledge of various sports activities and common sense of physiology and hygiene to the masses. To this end, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the editing and publishing of "New Sports" magazine and simple and popular sports books, and to plan to translate a large amount of Soviet sports materials. Sports organizations in large administrative regions, provinces, and large cities should regularly provide articles on sports issues to newspapers and periodicals or assist local newspapers in editing sports columns. Reports, radio, movies, exhibitions, and other methods should also be fully utilized to conduct regular and in-depth publicity to the general public. Sports meets and sports competitions are the best occasions for publicity and education of sports activities. We should widely mobilize and organize the masses to visit and conduct education.

        (2) Establish and gradually improve sports organizations at or above the provincial and municipal levels, and gradually achieve having full-time cadres, funding, and regular work. At present, some sports organizations are only empty shells and do not play a practical role. We must find ways to improve them and negotiate with relevant organizations to help solve them. The work of sports organizations at all levels must face the masses, specifically help basic units carry out sports activities, and the method is to strengthen key work, cultivate typical examples, summarize experience, and actively promote it. In order to ensure the development of sports activities in basic units, we must also find ways to gradually establish leading bodies for sports activities—sports committees—in basic units.

    (3) Another extremely important task for developing sports activities is to solve the problem of sports cadres. At present, the lack of sports cadres has become a serious problem for developing sports activities. In order to solve this problem, we must vigorously hold various amateur sports cadre short-term training courses, and cultivate a large number of activists in sports activities, so that after short-term study, they can understand the policies and tasks of sports activities, master the technology of one or several sports, and become promoters, organizers, and technical instructors of amateur sports activities in basic units. This is the main way to solve the current shortage of cadres. Actively assist the Ministry of Education in running the Central Institute of Physical Education well, and suggest expanding the existing sports colleges and university sports majors, and adding short-term training classes to train full-time sports cadres. During the holidays, we can also hold study sessions for physical education teachers to strengthen political study, transform their thinking, and improve their professional and technical level.

    Comrades, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the future of sports activities in New China is infinitely broad and far-reaching. We must work hard with a hundredfold confidence, and work with the people of the whole country to actively strive for the popularization and regularization of national sports activities!

    为国民体育运动的普及和经常化而奋斗
    荣高棠
     一、两三年来体育运动的概况和成绩
    中华全国体育总会筹备委员会成立已经两年多了。我们在这次大会上将正式成立中华全国体育总会，总会的正式成立将会进一步加强在全国范围内有组织有领导地开展体育运动。
    两三年来，在共产党和人民政府的关怀和领导下，在各有关机关团体的积极支持和体育工作者的努力下，体育运动已逐渐发展起来了。中华全国体育总会筹备委员会在积极进行筹备工作的同时，也在推动国民体育运动方面作了一些必要的工作，取得了一些成绩。这些成绩主要表现在以下四方面：
    （一）扩大了对国民体育运动的宣传，确立了体育运动的正确方向——为人民的健康、国防和生产建设服务，并在体育活动中开始树立新的集体主义的道德作风。体育运动的参加者在体育运动的实践活动中，初步认识了体育运动对锻炼体魄的科学价值，对加强国防和生产建设的重大意义。大多数的运动员在运动中表现了积极勇敢、团结友爱、不骄不馁、服从组织、遵守纪律的集体主义精神。有些运动员也是学习、工作、生产、战斗的模范。旧社会自私自利、互相打击、故意伤人的风头主义锦标主义的恶劣思想作风已有改变。在不花钱少花钱的原则下，很多地方发动义务劳动，并采取各种办法克服运动场地及设备不足的困难。以上的这些转变是广泛地正确地发展体育运动的重要条件。这是毛主席、共产党和人民政府的领导、关怀和经常教育的结果。
    （二）体育活动突破了比较狭小的范围，开始向更广大的群众中发展。旧社会里体育为少数人服务的面貌已经改观了。为了提倡和普及体育运动，全国各地的体育组织曾协助人民政府举行各种较大规模的运动会。据不完全的统计，三年来仅省、市以上的运动会即有四百多次，参加的运动员近百万人。有些地方还分别举行了工人、部队、学生、妇女的运动会。一九五一年举行了全国篮球排球和足球比赛大会，各地的运动成绩正在不断提高。去年十二月在全国推行了广播体操。在学校中，体育运动已逐渐趋于经常化制度化。例如：北京市大、中学生经常参加体育运动的已达百分之九十五以上。北京、天津、上海等城市在部分学校中实行了“锻炼标准”制度。这对于改善学生的健康状况、保证学习已起了一定的作用。在军队中体育运动较前更加开展，且已成为经常的正规训练内容之一。在有些工厂和机关中，体育活动的逐渐开展，对锻炼身体、提高劳动与工作效率、活跃生活等，都起了积极作用。全国工人中的体育运动以东北地区和铁路系统开展得较为普遍和经常，一九五一年铁路职工参加体育活动的达二十万人。在解放较早和土地改革已经完成的某些农村中，民间的体育活动也都有了发展。
    （三）各级体育组织的建立，体育干部和积极分子的改造和培养，这些都为今后广泛开展体育运动准备了一些必要条件。据不完全的统计，县以上的体育组织已有二百六十八个，各级体育组织，在党和政府的领导下，推动了当地的体育活动，积极进行了体育工作者的思想改造工作，经常举行学习会——两年来，省、市以上共有四十余次，一九五○年举行了全国体育工作者暑期学习会。特别是经过抗美援朝、捐献飞机大炮以及“三反”和思想改造等运动，全国的广大体育工作者的思想比前进步了，工作中的积极性和责任心比前提高了。很多体育组织同时注意了对于体育运动中涌现出来的大批积极分子的培养和训练工作，举办了各种业余的体育短期训练班，北京、天津两地各种业余体育短期训练班在半年时间所培养的业余体育干部就达两千余人。虽然这还远远不能满足目前工作的需要，但也初步解决了一部分体育干部不足的问题。
    （四）中华全国体育总会筹备委员会为了学习先进的苏联体育理论和实际经验，并加强与苏联以及各兄弟国家的体育工作者和运动员的友谊，和苏联以及各兄弟国家的体育组织建立了亲密的联系，参加了国际青年和学生的体育比赛活动。我们先后派出篮球队参加在布达佩斯举行的第十届世界大学生夏季运动会；派遣了篮排球队参加在布拉格举行的世界学生第二次代表大会的体育比赛；派遣了体育访问团到苏联去学习；派遣了篮排球队参加在柏林举行的第十一届世界大学生夏季运动会；解放军也派遣了体育代表团到捷克斯洛伐克参加捷克斯洛伐克建军节体育庆祝大会。一九五○年十二月我们还邀请了苏联体育代表团来中国访问和表演，对我国体育运动的开展起了很大鼓舞作用，并使我国体育界实际地接触并学习到了先进的苏联体育。今年七月波兰的男女篮球队将来访问中国。以上种种，是国民体育运动良好的开端。开展体育运动的工作还有许多缺点亟待克服，还落后于实际的需要。二、今后体育的方针和任务体育是新民主主义教育的一部分，它不仅可以锻炼人民健康的身体，而且能培养人民的勇敢、坚毅、机敏、乐观和集体主义精神的优良品质，能够胜任愉快地和坚持不渝地为建设祖国和保卫祖国服务。因此，开展体育运动对于国防事业、生产劳动及其他各种建设都有重大的积极意义。目前全国人民已投入伟大的增产节约的运动中，为了积极进行国防建设和经济建设，支持人民志愿军，体育运动的作用更加显著。同时，由于人民经济生活和文化生活水平逐步提高，体育运动也将会迅速的发展起来。
    但是，目前我们祖国大规模的经济建设还刚刚开始，在全国人民面前，摆着很多复杂、艰巨而又急迫的任务需要完成。另一方面，我们国家地区广大，情况复杂，各地区解放迟早不同，经济发展的情况也不平衡；城市和农村之间，学校、机关、工厂和部队之间，人民的生活情况和生产、工作、学习情况，也有差异。同时由于长期反动统治的结果，我国的体育工作基础比较薄弱，体育干部也不足。在这种情况下，体育运动的开展就只能是稳步地前进，而不能要求过高过急。
    根据上述情况，我们今后的工作方针应该是：在现有基础上，从实际出发并与实际相结合，使体育运动普及和经常化，积极地“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，为加强生产建设与国防建设而服务。
    为了贯彻这一方针，大力开展各学校、机关、工厂、部队、农村等基层单位经常性群众性的体育活动，是当前体育运动的中心任务。为此，必须：
        （一）开展多种多样形式的体育活动。凡有益于身体健康、而又简单易行的体育活动，均应加以提倡和推广。一方面继续发展体操、田径、球类、游泳等项目，和一些军事体育活动（如掷手榴弹、射击、航空模型等）；同时对于那些为群众所熟悉和爱好的民族体育形式（如武术、摔跤、石锁、砂袋、举石担、单杠、骑马、跳绳等）必须予以重视，并加以改进、去掉其不科学的部分，使之成为广泛开展劳动群众中的体育活动的有效形式之一。
    （二）根据各基层单位的实际条件，有步骤有组织地开展群众的体育工作。
    在一般体育条件不十分具备的单位中，应广泛开展一些简单的、方式灵活而与文娱相结合的体育活动，首先争取多数人都能参加一项或数项体育活动。通过各项体育活动发现积极分子，组织他们成立体育活动小组，使体育活动成为经常性的活动。
    在有些条件较好的单位中，可选择一项或几项体育活动订出适当的锻炼标准，实行“锻炼标准”制度，将参加者组成若干“锻炼小组”，经常进行锻炼活动，并定期总结成绩，对已达到规定标准者给予一定的奖励。各地在实行“锻炼标准”制度的时候，可根据北京、上海的经验，先自少数单位开始有重点地试行。开始时，锻炼项目要少些，标准订低些，以便吸引与鼓舞广大群众踊跃参加，取得经验之后，再逐步提高并推广。
    对于体育水平较高的群众，可组织他们成立各种运动小组或运动队（如篮球队、排球队、田径队等），并规定参加运动的公约和一定的努力目标，以鼓励大家提高技术，并不断地去影响和吸收新的群众参加。
        “准备劳动与保卫祖国”体育制度（简称劳卫制）是将来我国实施国民体育的基本制度，其目的在于使国民体育运动普及和经常开展，并保证每一个国民的身体得到全面锻炼和全面发展。但是目前我国还不具备普遍实施这种制度的条件，所以我们提议只在少数大城市中的个别单位先行试验，以便取得经验，作将来普遍推行的准备工作。
        （三）经常举行运动竞赛和运动会，对于普及体育运动并使之不断提高有着重要的作用。特别是在基层单位中，经常分别举行各项运动的竞赛，对于鼓舞本单位的群众参加体育活动，作用尤大。因此，应该提倡和组织各基层单位内部的或各基层单位之间的单项或数项运动的竞赛。此外，按照地区（大行政区、省、市、县、区）和职业系统（铁路、部队、学生等），定期举行各种运动竞赛及全国性的运动大会，也很重要。但是，那种包罗万象、项目和组别繁多、效果不大的运动大会，应尽量减少举行。为了使体育运动更加有计划的发展，今后应将运动会和各种运动竞赛会逐渐按季节形成一种制度。
    另外还有几项具体工作：
        （一）经常在群众中结合爱国主义、集体主义思想教育，宣传体育运动的目的性重要性、方针任务和新的道德作风，并普遍向群众介绍各种体育运动的基本方法和知识以及生理卫生常识，也是很重要的工作。为此，需要继续加强“新体育”杂志和简单通俗的体育书籍的编辑出版工作，要有计划地大量翻译苏联体育的材料。大行政区、省、大城市的体育组织应经常向报刊供给关于体育运动问题的文章或协助当地报纸编辑体育栏。报告会、广播、电影、展览会等方式也应充分利用，以便向广大群众进行经常深入的宣传。运动会和运动比赛是最好的体育运动的宣传和教育的场合，应广泛发动和组织群众参观，并进行教育。
        （二）建立与逐渐健全省、市以上的体育组织，有步骤地作到有专职干部，有经费，有经常工作。目前有些体育组织仅是一个空架子，而不起实际作用的，须设法改善，应与各有关机关团体协商加以帮助解决。各级体育组织的工作，必须面向广大群众，具体帮助基层单位开展体育运动，方法是加强重点工作、培养典型、总结经验，积极地进行推广。为保证各基层单位体育运动的发展，还必须设法在各基层单位逐渐建立体育运动的领导机构——体育委员会。
    （三）开展体育运动的另一项极为重要的工作就是解决体育干部的问题。目前由于体育干部的不足，已成为开展体育运动的严重问题。为了解决此问题，必须大力举办各种业余体育干部短期训练班，大量培养体育运动的积极分子，使他们经过短期学习后，了解体育运动的方针、任务，掌握一项或几项运动的技术，成为各基层单位业余的体育运动的宣传者、组织者和技术辅导员。这是目前解决干部不足的主要办法。积极协助中央教育部办好中央体育学院，并建议扩大现有的体育专科学校和大学体育专修科，增设短期训练的班次，以培养专职的体育干部。利用假期，还可举办体育教师学习会，加强政治学习、改造思想，提高业务技术水平。
    同志们，在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，新中国的体育运动的前途是无限宽阔远大的。我们一定要信心百倍地努力工作，与全国人民一道，为国民体育运动的普及和经常化而积极奋斗！
