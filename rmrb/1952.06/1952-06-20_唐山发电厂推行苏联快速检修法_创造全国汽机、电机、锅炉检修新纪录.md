Tangshan Power Plant Promotes Soviet Rapid Overhaul Method, Creating New National Records for Turbine, Motor, and Boiler Overhauls

Tangshan Power Plant, by promoting the Soviet rapid overhaul method, has created new national records for turbine, motor, and boiler overhauls. The rapid overhaul work began on May 26th and was completed on June 4th. The overhaul time was shortened by nearly one-half compared to the rated overhaul time by the Electricity Administration Bureau, resulting in power generation nine days and nine hours ahead of schedule, creating ten billion yuan of wealth for the country. After the rapid overhaul, the turbine's equipment output increased by 5.26 kilowatts compared to before, and the boiler's equipment output increased by 7.7 tons per hour, equivalent to saving the country an investment of three million catties of millet.

The main characteristics of the rapid overhaul are the meticulousness and organization of the preparation work. The primary link in the preparation work is to fully mobilize the masses of workers and carry out in-depth ideological mobilization. Initially, many workers held skeptical attitudes toward "rapid overhaul." Some old workers said, "Whether it's a fast repair or a slow repair, the time is set too short and it won't be completed!" Some technicians were satisfied with past overhaul achievements, believing that "past overhauls were already good enough, and couldn't be faster, otherwise there would be problems," and that "there are few skilled workers, many apprentices, and no mechanized tools," and "the time is short, there is not enough time to prepare, let's talk about it next time!" These conservative ideas and complacency directly hindered the promotion of advanced experience. To this end, the plant's leadership convened various symposiums to repeatedly explain the superiority of the rapid overhaul method and its political and economic significance in national economic construction. On one hand, they organized all employees to study and discuss the overhaul regulations and safety regulations of the rapid overhaul method; on the other hand, a delegation led by the plant director went to Fushun Power Plant to learn from their experience in studying the Soviet rapid overhaul. Through such political and ideological education and technical training, employees gained confidence in promoting the rapid overhaul experience. During this short ten-day overhaul, the plant had as many as thirty-nine mass-based rationalization proposals and inventions, exceeding the number of rationalization proposals and inventions in previous overhauls since liberation. The second link in the preparation work was to hand over the plan to the workers, and formulate workshop, team, and group progress schedules and comprehensive progress schedules. First, the leadership department compiled the overhaul plan and schedule progress table based on the overhaul regulations, improvement plans, mass rationalization proposals, safety inspections, and operating records, and then organized the overhaul personnel to discuss, accurately calculate man-hours, and arrange team and group progress schedules. The progress schedule specified in detail the exact time for a certain component from disassembly to installation, and specifically arranged the use time of important tools such as lifting and welding. The team and group progress schedules concentrated the wisdom of the masses of workers and became specific indicators for carrying out rapid overhauls. The third link in the preparation work was to rationally organize the labor force and implement a small group responsibility system. According to the nature of the work and projects, skilled workers were selected, manpower was allocated, and short, capable teams were formed. Each member of the team had a clear division of labor and specific responsibilities. During the work, all teams universally implemented the assembly line method, the process arrangement was compact, and division of labor and cooperation were carried out in parallel. Skilled workers and apprentices worked more closely together. When disassembling parts, the skilled worker disassembled in front, and the apprentice cleaned behind. The skilled worker then installed, and when the disassembly and cleaning were completed, the installation was also completed. During the overhaul, skilled workers could explain the operation methods to apprentices at any time, and quickly improve the technical level of apprentices. In addition, in the preparation work, ensuring the timely supply of materials and tools was also an important reason for ensuring the rapid overhaul. Before the overhaul, the supply personnel allocated materials according to the plan, supplemented tools, checked specifications, and handed them over to the using departments for acceptance; therefore, there were no work stoppages due to material shortages throughout the construction process, ensuring the smooth progress of the overhaul work.

After the preparation work was properly done, the main problem during the overhaul was to exert a strong organizational leadership role. The plant established an overhaul headquarters to unify the leadership of the overhaul work. The plant director, the secretary of the Party Committee, the chairman of the trade union, the engineer, and the acceptance personnel went to the site to grasp the progress of the work and promptly solve the temporary difficulties encountered in the work. For example, the turbine and motor workshops had rapid progress due to many creations and improvements by the workers, and could complete the overhaul task ahead of schedule. However, the boiler workshop had heavy tasks and slow progress, so the leadership promptly adjusted the labor force according to the actual situation and concentrated on overhauling the boiler's grate chain. The plant's leadership also sent people to Beijing and Tianjin power plants to borrow soot blowers and electric tube cleaners, and promptly solved the difficulty of lacking certain overhaul tools. Because the leading cadres clarified the idea of relying on the working class, got rid of administrative work, and went deep into the workshops, they further encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. For example, the work of installing plugs on the boiler tubes was previously done entirely by skilled workers, but this time it was completely handed over to ordinary workers and apprentices. After a short period of technical training, under their efforts, not only was the task completed ahead of schedule, but not a single plug leaked. The boiler tube cleaning team, in order to meet the requirements of rapid overhaul, created a "fast pull and fast delivery" tube cleaning method, which increased work efficiency three times, from washing forty tubes a day to one hundred and twenty tubes. The workers who repaired the grate researched and developed the use of machinery instead of manpower to pull the grate, which increased efficiency by two and a half times. The repair workshop made its own economizer plugs, eliminating water leakage in the economizer.

Before the overhaul began, the plant also organized a group of acceptance personnel with considerable technical level to repeatedly study the acceptance regulations and formulate quality standards. During the overhaul, in addition to mobilizing the masses to ensure quality, these acceptance personnel more leadershiply implemented a "sectional acceptance system" according to the progress, went deep into the site and even inside the boiler, and strictly accepted, thereby ensuring that the quality fully met the prescribed standards. The plant's experience proves that implementing rapid overhauls only has real significance for safe operation and improving equipment output on the basis of ensuring quality. (Xinhua News Agency)

    唐山发电厂推行苏联快速检修法
    创造全国汽机、电机、锅炉检修新纪录
    唐山发电厂推行苏联快速检修法，创造了全国汽机、电机、锅炉检修的新纪录。快速检修工作在五月二十六日开始，到六月四日完成。检修时间比电业总局额定检修时间缩短了近二分之一，结果提前发电九天又九小时，为国家创造了十亿元财富。快速检修后，汽机的设备出力较前提高了百分之五点二六瓩，锅炉的设备出力较前提高了七点七吨小时，等于给国家节约了三百万斤小米的投资。
    快速检修的主要特点是准备工作的严密性和组织性。准备工作的首要环节是充分发动职工群众，深入进行思想动员。开初不少工人对“快速检修”抱着怀疑的态度，有的老工友说：“什么快修、慢修，反正时间规定少了到时完不成！”有的技术人员满足于过去的检修成绩，认为“过去的检修已经不错了，不能再快，快了就要出乱子”，认为“技工少，学徒多，没有机械化工具”，“时间短，来不及准备，下次再说吧！”这些保守思想和自满情绪直接障碍着先进经验的推广。为此，该厂领导方面分别召开了各种座谈会，反复讲解快速检修的优越性及其在国家经济建设中的政治意义和经济意义。一面组织全体职工学习讨论快速检修法的检修规程和保安规程；一面以厂长为首组成参观团，到抚顺电厂学习该厂学习苏联快速检修的经验。经过这样的政治思想教育和技术训练，使职工对推行快速检修经验有了信心。在此次短短的十天检修中，该厂群众性的合理化建议和创造发明就有三十九件之多，超过了解放以来历次检修中合理化建议和创造发明的件数。准备工作的第二个环节是把计划交给工人，制订车间、班、组进度表和综合进度表。首先由领导部门根据检修规程项目、改进计划、群众合理化建议、安全检查、运行纪录等编订了检修计划及日程进度表，然后组织参加检修的人员讨论，精确计算工时，排定班、组进度表。进度表内详细规定了某一机件由拆修到安装的精确时间，具体安排了起重、焊接等重要工具的使用时间。班、组进度表集中了职工群众的智慧，成为进行快速检修的具体指标。准备工作的第三个环节是合理地组织劳动力，实行小组负责制。按工作性质和项目，挑选技工，分配人力，组成短小精悍的小组。小组内的每个成员，分工明确，各有专责。在工作进行中，各小组普遍实行了流水作业法，工序排列紧凑，分工合作，交叉进行。技工和学徒更密切配合，在拆卸机件时，技工前面拆，学徒后面擦洗，技工随后进行安装，等拆完擦完，也就安装完工。在检修中，技工能随时向学徒讲明操作方法，迅速提高学徒技术水平。此外，在准备工作中，使材料、工具能作到及时供应，也是保证快速检修的重要原因。检修前，供应人员就根据计划调配材料，补充工具，检查规格，交使用部门验收；因此整个施工过程中未发生停工待料现象，保证了检修工作的顺利推进。
    准备工作妥当后，检修进行中的主要问题是发挥坚强的组织领导作用。该厂成立了检修指挥部，统一了检修工作的领导。厂长、中共党委书记、工会主席、工程师、验收人员分头深入现场掌握工作的进度，及时解决工作中临时遭遇的困难问题。如汽机、电机车间由于工人有许多创造和改进，进度迅速，都可提前完成检修任务，但锅炉车间任务繁重，进度较为迟缓，领导方面就及时地按实际情况调整劳力，突击锅炉的炉排炼条检修工作。该厂领导方面并派人到北京、天津各电厂借来吹灰器和电动洗管器，及时解决了缺乏某些检修工具的困难。由于领导干部明确了依靠工人阶级的思想，摆脱事务工作，深入车间，因而更加鼓舞了职工们的工作热情。例如锅炉排管装堵头的工作，过去完全由技工做，这次完全交给普通工和学徒，事先进行了短期的技术训练，在他们的努力下，不仅提前完成了任务，而且没有一个堵头漏水。锅炉洗管组，为了适应快速检修的要求，创造了“快拉快送”的洗管法，工作效率较前提高了三倍，由每天洗四十根提高到一百二十根。检修炉排的工人，研究出以机械代替人力拉炉排，提高效率两倍半。修配车间自制省煤器堵头，使省煤器消灭了漏水现象。
    在检修开始前，该厂还组织了一批有相当技术水平的验收人员，反复学习验收规程，厘订质量标准。检修中，除发动群众保证质量外，这批验收人员更有领导地按进度实行“分段验收制”，深入现场甚至锅炉内部，严格验收，从而保证了质量完全合乎规定标准。该厂经验证明：实行快速检修，只有在保证质量的基础上，对安全运转和提高设备出力才有真正的意义。（新华社）
