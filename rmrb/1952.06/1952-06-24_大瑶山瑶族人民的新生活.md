The first session of the People's Representatives Conference of all nationalities was held in Dayaoshan, Guangxi Province, from May 21st to 29th. The Yao Autonomous Region People's Government of Dayaoshan County was established, and Jin Baosheng of the Chashan Yao and Zhao Chun'an of the Ban Yao were elected as county heads and deputy county heads respectively. This is the happiest event the Yao people have ever had in history.

On May 28th, the day the Autonomous Region People's Government was established, people from all districts braved the heavy rain to come from dozens of miles away to participate in the celebration meeting. Red flags were flying on the square of the meeting, gongs and drums were sounding, and joyful songs were heard everywhere. Yao young women Su Yu'e and Su Yuying happily sang a folk song:

　　The iron tree blooms after a thousand years, the minority nationalities are now the masters;
　　Support Baosheng as the county head, and production will greatly increase next year.
　　The sun in the east is red and bright, the minority nationalities are truly glorious;
　　The minority nationalities have become masters, all thanks to our benefactor Chairman Mao.

　　Duckweed blooms tiny flowers in the pond, all nationalities are one family;
　　Let's unite to engage in production, and resist America and aid Korea to protect our country.

Dayaoshan in Guangxi Province is a Yao ethnic group settlement area, with a total of more than 18,000 Yao people and more than 7,000 Han and Zhuang people. The entire mountain is more than 400 li long and about 200 li wide. There are many stones and little arable land on the mountain, and there are undulating cogon grass ridges everywhere, interspersed with forests of 40 to 50 li of green shade. Here there are diligent, hardworking, honest and brave people, vast lands that can be developed, and abundant local specialties. Every year, large quantities of fragrant grass, fragrant mushrooms, Tianhuafen, Job's tears, Shuyu, tung seeds, tea, etc. are sold to Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places. Dried bamboo shoots, palm clothing, gallnuts, indigo, luohan fruit, rattan, and wood ear and other local specialties also have considerable yields.

Such a rich and lovely Dayaoshan, but in history, it was a tragic hell on earth. The Kuomintang reactionaries Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs used extremely despicable means to buy off the bad Yao heads Tao Zhenda and Quan Shengzhu among the Yao people, robbing and bloodwashing Dayaoshan. Some villages were completely robbed and burned down. An old blind woman in Tian Village was rescued from the fire by her son, but was snatched by Kuomintang executioners and thrown into the fire to be burned to death. The Yao people originally did not grow opium, but the Kuomintang bandit gang insisted on imposing the crime of growing opium and fined every household. Chashan Yao women liked to wear silver plate hats, but the Kuomintang bandit gang insisted on forcing them to change their clothes. As soon as they saw Yao women, they would chase them up the mountains or into their houses in a vicious manner, raping them and robbing them of their silver plates. The Kuomintang bandit gang also used various conspiracies to provoke feelings between ethnic groups, creating divisions between the Han and Yao people, as well as within the Yao ethnic group.

Within the Yao ethnic group, there are distinctions between Chashan Yao, Ao Yao, Flower Basket Yao, Shanzi Yao, and Ban Yao. In the past, the reactionary ruling class colluded with a small number of bad Yao heads of the Chashan Yao, Ao Yao, and Flower Basket Yao to oppress the Yao people. A small number of bad Yao heads also relied on the power of the reactionary rulers to consolidate their ruling position among the Yao people. The most oppressed among the Yao people were the Shanzi Yao and Ban Yao. Not only did they have to pay rent to the Yao heads when opening up wasteland, but they also had to pay land rent for burying the dead, and send wine and meat to the mountain owners when marrying a wife. They even had no right to freely catch birds in the sky and fish in the river. Therefore, the Shanzi Yao and Ban Yao worked hard all year round, but had no quilts to cover, no clothes to wear, and even corn porridge was hard to come by, often having to live on wild vegetables. A small village in the Northeast Township had to eat 50,000 jin of wild vegetables a year. In many places, boys and girls could not wear pants until they were twelve or thirteen years old. Except for a very small number of Yao heads, the vast majority of the Chashan Yao, Ao Yao, and Flower Basket Yao only cultivated very little land and were equally oppressed and exploited by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and their lives were also very difficult. Because they were provoked by the reactionary rulers, they also discriminated against the Shanzi Yao and Ban Yao, and even verbally abused them.

In order to get rid of their suffering, the Yao people fought heroically against the enemy in 1940, 1944 and 1949. Finally, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, the enemy was overthrown. Since then, more than 20,000 people in Dayaoshan have begun to work happily and build their new lives on the wide and lovely mountains.

In order to help the people of Dayaoshan build a new life, the Central Nationalities Visiting Group visited Dayaoshan. With the help of the Central Nationalities Visiting Group, people of all ethnic groups consciously and voluntarily signed a unity covenant, agreeing to help each other and develop production. Last year, people of all ethnic groups universally increased grain production by one month, and individual regions increased grain production by three months.

In order to implement the ethnic policy stipulated in the Common Program, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government sent a national work team to Dayaoshan in January this year to help the Yao people promote the work of regional autonomy in political power construction. After four months of work, 39 townships and six districts in Dayaoshan have implemented regional autonomy and established Yao Autonomous Region People's Governments at the district and township levels. Among the sixteen district heads and deputy district heads in the six districts, fifteen are Yao people. Among the 149 newly trained and promoted district and township cadres, 130 are Yao people.

After the implementation of regional autonomy, the unity within the Yao ethnic group and the unity between the Yao ethnic group and the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups have also been gradually strengthened and consolidated. Jinxiu, the center of Dayaoshan, is an area where the Chashan Yao live. After the implementation of regional autonomy, some people here have voluntarily asked the Ban Yao to reclaim wasteland and cultivate local specialties. The harmony of feelings between the Chashan Yao and Ban Yao now is unprecedented in history. For example, the Chashan Yao in Jin Village not only let the Ban Yao reclaim wasteland and cultivate local specialties, but even the paddy fields farther away from Jin Village are willing to rent to the Ban Yao. The Chashan Yao in Jin Village also entertain the Ban Yao who come to their homes for meals; some people voluntarily give the Ban Yao clothes, food, salt and other items. The feelings between the Han and Yao people have also become harmonious. The Han people in the Pingnan Yao ethnic group residential area used more than a thousand workdays to help the Yao people open up a water canal.

The gratifying phenomenon of the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups was very obvious when the people of all ethnic groups were distributing the agricultural tools and relief cotton clothes loaned by the People's Government. The Han people said: "The Yao people are poor, the Yao comrades should get them first." The Chashan Yao and Ao Yao people said: "The Ban Yao and Shanzi Yao are poor, the Ban Yao and Shanzi Yao comrades should get them first." The Ban Yao and Shanzi Yao people said: "We don't need so much, everyone should have it, that's reasonable."

The People's Government has allocated 2.2 billion yuan to help the people of Dayaoshan develop production and improve their lives. At present, more than 565 million yuan has been loaned out, solving the difficulties of the Yao people in agricultural tools, plows, fertilizers, and seeds. The entire Dayaoshan has 5,458 households, with an average of more than two pieces of agricultural tools per household. According to the production plans set by each household this year, they will guarantee an increase of more than 4,425,900 jin of grain this year compared to last year, an increase of about 30%. The average increase per person is three months and twenty-three days of rations. Local specialties are also planned to be greatly increased.

In order to complete their production plans, the people of all ethnic groups in Dayaoshan start early and work late, and some even light fires at night to reclaim wasteland. When spring comes, on the tops of the mountains, by the streams, and on the sunny slopes, you can see hoes shining in the sun everywhere, and you can hear songs like this everywhere: "The Yao mountains and barren ridges are wide and wide, work hard to reclaim and plant miscellaneous grains; plant miscellaneous grains to have a good life, resist America and aid Korea to liberate Taiwan." "Don't forget the kindness of Chairman Mao, who sent tea seeds and grain; 3.2 million tea seeds, work hard to produce happily." As of the end of May, 21,917 mu of new wasteland has been opened up in 40 townships in Dayaoshan. The Yao people in some areas have combined increasing production with patriotism. The slogan they put forward is: Strive to increase production, and strive to reduce or not need relief grain next year, and save these grains to resist America and aid Korea and defend our people's country. Under this patriotic slogan, young adults, women, children and the elderly have all joined the production upsurge, launching production competitions between groups, villages and townships, and everyone is striving to be a labor model. In many villages, the children's team gets up early every morning to blow whistles or beat drums to urge adults to get up and produce early, ensuring that there are no lazy people. The children's team goes to collect manure every morning, and some children have also set a plan to collect 50 jin of manure every month. Adults go to reclaim wasteland early in the morning, and some simply build sheds on the mountains to avoid delaying production time by going back and forth. The fluffy weeds on the yellow soil ridges on both sides of the Jinxiu stream have turned into newly dug and turned brown soil.

During the rice transplanting season, according to Yao customs, young men and women must wear snow-white or blue Yao costumes; groups of them transplant rice while joyfully wishing a bumper harvest this year. During the busy farming season, the trade and sales office, which had just been established in Jinxiu, became unexpectedly busy. There, you can often hear the happy laughter of young men and women buying cloth. The newly established People's Bank Jinxiu business office also began to get busy with the arrival of the rice transplanting season. Yao elders who wanted to borrow money to buy plows and harrows kept flocking to the People's Bank.

Jinxiu is becoming more and more prosperous every day. Every night, when the school bell rings, people from villages and settlements such as Jinxiu, Xidi, Guluo, Baisha, etc., carry lights and walk along the banks of the stream to the primary school on the highlands by the stream to study. Even during the busy farming season, they are reluctant to relax their studies.

    大瑶山瑶族人民的新生活
    苗延秀
    广西省大瑶山在五月二十一日到二十九日举行了首届各民族人民代表会议，大瑶山县瑶族自治区人民政府诞生了，茶山瑶金宝生、板瑶赵春安当选为正副县长。这是瑶族人民有史以来从未有过的一件大喜事。
    五月二十八日，自治区人民政府成立的那一天，各区的群众远从几十里外冒着大雨赶来参加庆祝大会。大会的广场上红旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，到处响着欢乐的歌声。瑶族青年妇女苏玉娥、苏玉英高兴地唱出一首山歌：
    千年铁树开了花，少数民族当了家；
    拥护宝生当县长，明年生产大增加。
    东方太阳红又红，少数民族真光荣；
    少数民族做了主，全靠恩人毛泽东。
    塘里浮萍开细花，各个民族是一家；
    大家团结搞生产，抗美援朝保国家。
    广西省大瑶山是瑶族聚居区，共有瑶族人民一万八千多人，汉族、僮族人民七千多人。全山长四百多里，宽约二百里。山上石多田少，到处是连绵起伏的黄茅草岭，间杂有四五十里绿荫连成一片的树林。这里有勤劳、刻苦、诚实而又勇敢的人民，有可以开发的广阔的土地，有丰富的土特产品。每年都有大宗的香草、香菇、天花粉、薏米、薯良、桐子、茶等，远销广州、香港等地。笋干、棕衣、五倍子、蓝靛、罗汉果、白藤、木耳等土产特产也有可观的产量。
    大瑶山这样富饶、可爱，但在历史上却是一个悲惨的人间地狱。国民党反动派李宗仁、白崇禧匪帮曾用极端卑鄙的手段收买了瑶族中的败类坏瑶头陶振达、全胜祝，抢掠和血洗大瑶山。有的村被全部抢光、烧光。田村一个瞎了眼的老太太被她儿子从火里抢救出来，又被国民党刽子手抢去丢进火里烧死。瑶民本来不种鸦片，国民党匪帮硬给按上种鸦片的罪名，挨家罚款。茶山瑶妇女喜欢戴银板子帽，国民党匪帮硬要她们改装。他们一见瑶族妇女，就穷凶极恶地追到山上或屋里，强奸她们，抢走她们的银板。国民党匪帮还用种种阴谋手段挑拨民族间的感情，制造汉族和瑶族之间以及瑶族内部的分裂。
    瑶族内部有茶山瑶、坳瑶、花篮瑶和山子瑶、板瑶的分别。过去反动统治阶级勾结茶山瑶、坳瑶、花篮瑶的少数坏瑶头压迫瑶族人民。少数坏瑶头也仰仗反动统治者的势力，巩固他们在瑶族中的统治地位。瑶族中最受压迫的是山子瑶和板瑶。他们不仅在开生荒时要向瑶头交租，埋死人要交地皮租，娶老婆要送山主酒和肉，甚至对天空的飞鸟，河里的游鱼也无权利自由捉捕。因此山子瑶和板瑶终年勤苦劳动，却没有被子盖，没有衣服穿，连苞米粥也很难吃得饱，时常要靠吃野菜过活。东北乡有一个小屯，一年要吃五万斤野菜。许多地方的男女孩子，长到十二三岁还穿不上裤子。茶山瑶、坳瑶、花篮瑶中除了极少数的瑶头外，绝大多数只耕种着很少的土地，同样受着国民党反动派的压迫和剥削，生活也非常困苦。他们因为受了反动统治者的挑拨，也歧视山子瑶和板瑶，甚至恶语辱骂。
    瑶族人民为了摆脱他们的苦难，曾在一九四○年、一九四四年和一九四九年向敌人作过英勇的斗争。最后终于在中国共产党和人民解放军帮助下，打倒了敌人。从此，大瑶山的两万多群众，开始在宽阔可爱的山地上愉快地劳动，建设自己的新生活。
    为了帮助大瑶山人民建设新生活，中央民族访问团曾到大瑶山访问。在中央民族访问团帮助下，各族人民自觉自愿地订立了团结公约，相约互相帮助，发展生产。去年一年，各族人民就普遍增产了一个月的粮食，个别地区增产了三个月的粮食。
    广西省人民政府为实现共同纲领所规定的民族政策，今年一月派民族工作队到大瑶山帮助瑶族推行区域自治的政权建设工作。经过四个月的工作，大瑶山已有三十九个乡、六个区实行了区域自治，成立了区、乡级的瑶族自治区人民政府。在六个区十六个正副区长中，有十五个是瑶族。在新培养和提拔的一百四十九个区乡干部中，有一百三十人是瑶族。
    实行区域自治以后，瑶族内部的团结、瑶族和汉族、僮族之间的团结也逐渐加强和巩固起来。大瑶山的中心金秀，是茶山瑶居住的地区；实行区域自治以后，这里有些人已自动请板瑶来开垦荒地，培植土特产。现在茶山瑶和板瑶间感情的和谐，是历史上从来没有过的。如金村的茶山瑶不但把荒山让给板瑶开垦和培植土特产，连离金村远些的水田，也愿意租给板瑶种。金村茶山瑶还招待那些到自己家里来的板瑶吃饭；有的人自动送给板瑶衣服、粮食、食盐等物品。汉族和瑶族的感情也融洽了。平南瑶族居住区的汉族人民，用一千多个工帮助瑶民开了一条水圳。
    各族人民大团结的可喜现象，在各族人民分配人民政府贷给的农具和救济棉衣时，表现得很明显。汉族人民说：“瑶族苦，瑶族同志先要。”茶山瑶、坳瑶人民说：“板瑶、山子瑶苦，板瑶、山子瑶同志们先要。”板瑶、山子瑶人民说：“我们要不了这么多，大家都要才合理。”
    人民政府曾拨款二十二亿元帮助大瑶山人民发展生产，改善生活。目前已贷出五亿六千五百多万元，解决了瑶族人民的农具、耕牛、肥料、种子的困难。全大瑶山五千四百五十八户，平均每家得农具两件以上。按照今年各户所订生产计划，他们将保证今年比去年增产粮食四百四十二万五千九百多斤，计约增产三成。平均每人增加三个月零二十三天的口粮。土特产品也计划大量增产。
    大瑶山各族人民为了完成自己的生产计划，每天起早贪黑，甚至有人连夜点火开荒。当春天来临的时候，在山头上，在溪流边，在向阳的山坡上，到处可以看到锄头在阳光中闪亮，到处可以听到这样的歌声：“瑶山荒岭宽又宽，努力开垦种杂粮；种得杂粮生活好，抗美援朝解放台湾。”“毛主席恩情莫要忘，送来茶子又送粮；茶子三千二百万，努力生产乐洋洋。”截至五月中止，在大瑶山四十个乡中，已开新荒地二万一千九百十七亩。有的地区的瑶族人民已经把增产和爱国结合起来。他们提出的口号是：努力增加生产，明年争取减少或不要救济粮，省下这些粮拿去抗美援朝，保卫我们人民的江山。在这个爱国口号下，青壮年、妇女、儿童以及老人都卷入了生产热潮，展开了组和组、村和村、乡和乡的生产竞赛，人人争取当劳动模范。许多村庄每天早晨由儿童队起早吹哨或打鼓，催大人起床赶早生产，保证无一懒汉。儿童队每天早晨去拾粪，有的儿童还订了每月拾粪五十斤的计划。成年人一早就去开荒，有的索性在山上搭棚住，以免往返耽误生产时间。金秀溪流两岸黄土岭上的毛蓬蓬的荒草，变成了新挖翻的连成一片的褐色土壤。
    在插秧的季节，按瑶族的习惯，男女青年都要穿上雪白的或蓝色的瑶家盛装；一群群地一边插秧，一边欢乐地预祝今年大丰收。农忙期间刚在金秀设立不久的贸易购销处，出乎意料地繁忙起来。在那里常常可以听到青年男女买布时愉快的笑声。新设的人民银行金秀营业所也随着插秧季节的到来开始繁忙起来。要借钱买耕牛耙地的瑶族父老，不断地涌到人民银行来。
    金秀一天天地繁荣起来了。每夜，当学校的钟声敲响的时候，人们从金秀、昔地、古罗、白沙等等的村屯里，提着灯火，沿着溪流的两岸，走向溪旁高地上的小学校去念书。甚至在农忙的季节，他们也不肯放松学习。新华社更正
