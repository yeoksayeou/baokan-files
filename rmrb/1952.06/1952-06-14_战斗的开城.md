    Fighting Kaesong
    Liu Baiyu

    I arrived at the neutral zone front at night. The first thing people notice when they arrive in Kaesong is the towering searchlight beam in the sky above Panmunjom, but does this symbolize hope for peace? No, American planes are constantly circling overhead. Look again at the bright flares on the front lines, listen again to the fierce artillery fire on the front lines. All of this reminds us that Kaesong in the neutral zone is not a peaceful Kaesong, but a fighting Kaesong.

    No matter how cruel the war, spring still brings new scenes. I live near an apple orchard, and I saw a cheerful driver who had even stuck a bunch of red peonies on his speeding jeep. But the green of early summer can never cover up the ruins. One evening, I went to the old farmer Huang Changshun's cottage. His son, Huang Zhouyu, recently had good news: he had twice won the glorious National Flag Medal in the guerrillas. This Korean old man kindly longed for his son. The old couple often fantasized that Zhouyu might be in Pyongyang, so let's walk a hundred miles a day to see him! But the old man talked to me about hatred, saying that on nights of frenzied bombing, the city was destroyed in a blaze of fire, and his brother's family was also destroyed in a blaze of fire. He said deeply, "I don't want to think about it...."

    Kaesong is the ancient capital of the Goryeo Dynasty, and now the bustling city center has become a desolate open space. The American bandits plundered the precious ancient Goryeo ceramics and threw Kaesong back into a pool of blood. If you ask how many people are buried under this open space? According to Comrade Li Jihe of the Kaesong City Party Committee of the Labor Party, more than 5,000 people are buried here under constant bombing. Of course, this is not enough to illustrate all the crimes of the American fascists. They also carried out a frenzied and terrifying massacre when they occupied Kaesong for the second time. More than sixty bodies were piled up in a cellar. Cui Renzhen was a patriotic young man who was murdered at that time. I sat on the porch of his house. His father said, "It used to be said that sons avenge their fathers, but now fathers can also avenge their sons." For the sake of his son, this stubborn old man suffered torture and interrogation. At that juncture, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers came, and the miserable days were finally over. But the old mother still can't help but get excited when she talks about it now: "I can't hold back the hatred in my heart, I only have one hope, that we must win." The bloodstains of the people of Kaesong tell us what victory is, and these profound words tell us what victory is. Her second son is now fighting in the Taebaek Mountains guerrilla team.

    I know that countless people want to get an answer from Kaesong. Since the start of the armistice negotiations, people have wanted to know if there can be peace. But if we want to talk about peace, we must see clearly the solemn struggle for peace. The tombstone of "Martyr Yao Qingxiang, who sacrificed for peace in Korea" illustrates one side of this solemn struggle. This tombstone faces Panmunjom forever. I visited Yao Qingxiang's company in Songgok-ri on the front lines. His comrades pointed to the foot of the mountain with three small trees and said: that is where the American murderers ambushed. I have never met Yao Qingxiang, but I still vividly feel him as a tall man among the people. He was brave, but gentle and quiet. This man, who came from a mining background, was so pure and kind that when he was suddenly attacked by bullets and fell to the ground, the last thing he said was: "This is a world problem, I would rather sacrifice myself...." At this time, he had a gun in his hand, and there were bullets in the chamber, but he did not fire. He faithfully abided by the negotiation agreement until his death. Let the blood of this peace fighter expose the despicable nature of those American murderers. But the Korean old mother hugged him as tightly as she would her own son, crying and begging: "Don't send Yao Qingxiang back to China, leave him to us Koreans! He is for us Koreans, leave him with us forever in Korea." Yao Qingxiang is the kind of person who is dead but still alive in the world. The soldiers on the front line remember firmly that he always came to inspect the sentry posts, whether on windy nights or rainy dawns. At that time, he told the soldiers: "We must be patient, for the sake of the peace mission...." Today, people swear in his name: "Do the work well," "Complete the guard duty." Millions of soldiers form a strong front line, defending Kaesong, defending peace. Think about such a real person, such a loyal heart to the struggle, what a solemn reality. Who is destroying peace, who is defending peace, let the solemn reality speak.

    The armistice negotiations in Panmunjom have gone from one summer to another, the tents have faded, but the people of Kaesong's determination to fight for peace has become stronger. In front of the "Kaesong News" editorial department, people are crowded every day before the publication time. They ask about the progress of the negotiations. The people's eyes are discerning, and they have already seen through these American bandits, their "humanitarian principles" are the bloody cases created one after another in the neutral zone. Now, it is not only a delegation that is participating in the negotiation struggle, the people of Kaesong form the entire outpost to support the struggle. On May 14th, American planes circled at low altitude over Kaesong and dropped nearly thirty flares, the dazzling white light illuminating the entire city. But threats and deceptions have long gone bankrupt. This is what a citizen said on a full moon night: "The Americans have done such a thing today, how will they answer in tomorrow's meeting? Perhaps they will shamelessly say that they threw it wrong again. Didn't they once bomb and then say they didn't know there was such a thing?"

    The American bandits fire artillery every day, dumping tons of steel on our positions. But if they really attack, they will never get any small benefit. A recent attack by the American army next to Panmunjom is an example. I happened to be visiting our front line that day. From a watchtower, we could clearly see the tent where the meeting was being held in Panmunjom, the American front lines across the Shachuan River, and our farthest outpost with towering overhead power lines. At that moment, the American army was fiercely attacking there. In the sunlight, balls of blue artillery fire smoke flashed, and tanks swept up a cloud of yellow dust behind the small hill. Listen! The machine guns are firing like raindrops, and our heroes are already fighting back. That night I got the good news of victory from our smiling commander, our heroes welcomed the enemy with bombs, and the corpses of the American invaders were crawling in front of our positions. The anti-tank gunners also showed their power, destroying six tanks in one burst. At this time, I laughed, because I remembered that when I visited Panmunjom a few days ago, the American artillery shells shook the negotiation table every time the meeting started. At that time, I was very angry, but now isn't this the answer from our Kaesong front-line soldiers who are defending peace to the enemy?

    The front-line company uses artillery shells to raise flowers, and I saw the same flowers blooming on the desks of factories in the city. From the front line to the rear, the small details of life in the war often have a close connection. I visited the Kaesong factory and the countryside, and I visited the first group of model workers who resumed production and construction on the ruins. I visited the female worker Jin Zhenlin in the textile factory. Here, new wooden sheds are erected on the burned foundations, slogans that encourage labor enthusiasm appear on the walls with bullet marks, and the first batch of new cotton yarn is sent out from the workshop. This factory supplies the textile households in Kaesong. I didn't plan to visit the power station during the day, because I wanted to see how the power station supplies warmth and happiness to every family at night. Electrician Fang Yingliang met us wearing a white woolen sweater. The power station was systematically destroyed by the American invaders when they retreated. Fang Yingliang worked tirelessly for many days in the cold winter, wearing thin clothes. Like Jin Zhenlin, he was unwilling to talk about his own achievements. He just smiled slightly and said, "There wasn't even time to smoke a cigarette at that time." His wife still lives in a cellar in Sariwon. But thousands of electric lights are shining under the roofs of Kaesong residents. That day, I saw children reading under the lamp on the porch of Cui Renzhen's house, and the mother folding washed clothes under the lamp.

    After visiting the factory, I visited the countryside. The Dragon Boat Festival has just passed, and there has been a timely rain. The countryside is the busy season for farming. Cuckoos are calling, and everywhere in the endless paddy fields are people in white clothes transplanting rice seedlings. On this warm afternoon, Kim Taek-kyung, a model for increased production, also went to the fields. Park Seong-jin, the village party secretary and wounded veteran, received us on his behalf. He told me with a smile: "Kim Taek-kyung is very enthusiastic! He is the first to adopt new production methods this year. He is preparing to increase grain production by three times." After we chatted, Park Seong-jin sat on the porch of his house and slowly rolled a cigarette, telling me a very moving story. He said that a part of the Chinese People's Volunteers used to live in this village, but one day they received orders to set off for the front line. After they left, the village suddenly felt like it had lost a loved one. The children all felt lonely. Not long ago, one morning, a group of old mothers went to the front line along the road. They braved the danger of artillery fire and found their relatives on the front line. So, mutual greetings unfolded in the trenches, and the Korean mothers all shed tears. The soldiers let them spend a pleasant day on the front line. I like this story, I thought about this true story for a long, long time. Because I saw the cruel traces of the war in Kaesong and heard the profound complaints. But I have to say that I increasingly see the deep love of the people. This deep love is growing in the battle. The flames of war burned down the ancient city, but a new city was born in the flames. These days the moonlight is clear. Late at night, I stood on the platform in front of my house, looking at the entire Kaesong. At this time, I heard the very pleasant singing that I heard in the factory that day, they sang "Kim Il-sung", "Arirang", and "The East is Red" one after another. I know how close this joyful singing of the workers is to the solemn oath of the soldiers on the front line. At the same time, how closely connected is the strong and calm will of the soldiers with this story in the countryside. Today, the Korean land is still burning, today, the Korean people are still bleeding, but regarding the question of peace, it is not difficult for us to get an answer. Our strength to defend peace is getting stronger and stronger in the battle, and this strength will win the victory of peace in Korea.

    战斗的开城
    刘白羽
    我在一个夜间到达中立区阵线。到开城的人首先就会注意板门店上空那道高耸空中的探照灯光，可是这象征和平的希望吗？不，美国飞机正在上空不断盘旋。你再看前沿阵地上闪亮的照明弹，你再听前沿阵地上激烈的炮声。这一切就都警醒着我们，中立区的开城不是宁静的开城，而是战斗的开城。
    不管战争怎样残酷，春天还是带来了新的景象。我住在一片苹果林边，我看见心情愉悦的司机在他飞驶的吉普车上也插上了一束红芍药。但是初夏的发绿却绝不能掩盖废墟。一个黄昏，我到了老农民黄长顺小屋里。他的儿子黄周玉最近来了个喜信，他在游击队里两度获得光荣的国旗勋章。这位朝鲜老人亲切地想望着儿子。老夫妇常常幻想周玉也许到了平壤，那么我们一天走一百里去看看他吧！可是老人却跟我谈起仇恨，说疯狂轰炸的夜晚，城市在一阵火光中毁灭了，他兄弟一家人也在一阵火光中毁灭了。他深沉地说：“我不愿回想……。”
    开城是高丽王朝的古都，现在繁华的市中心区变成一片荒凉的旷场。美国强盗把珍贵的古代高丽陶瓷劫掠一空，把开城又扔在血泊里。你要问这旷场下埋葬了多少人？按劳动党开城市党部委员会的李基赫同志告诉我，在不断轰炸下这下面埋葬了五千多人。当然这并不足以说明美国法西斯的全部罪行。他们第二次侵占开城时又进行了疯狂恐怖的屠杀。在一个地窖里就堆积着六十多具尸体。崔仁镇就是那时被谋杀的一个爱国青年。我坐在他家屋廊下。他的父亲说：“从前都说儿子给父亲报仇，现在父亲也可以给儿子报仇。”为了儿子的缘故，这个倔强的老人受尽毒刑拷问。在那关头，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军来了，悲惨的日子终于过去。可是老母亲现在讲起来还不免激动：“我忍不住心里的仇恨，我只有一个希望，就是我们一定要胜利。”开城人的血迹告诉我们什么是胜利，这些深沉的言语告诉我们什么是胜利。她的第二个儿子现在正在太白山游击队里进行战斗。
    我知道无数人想从开城得到一个回答，从停战谈判开始起，人们就想知道能不能和平。但我们要谈和平就要看清为和平的庄严的斗争。“为朝鲜和平而牺牲的姚庆祥烈士”的墓碑，就说明这庄严斗争的一面。这墓碑永远面向着板门店。我在前沿阵地的松谷里访问了姚庆祥连队。他的战友指着那三棵小树的山脚下说：那就是美国谋杀者伏击的地点。我没见过姚庆祥，但我从人们中间还活生生地感觉着他这个高高个子的人。他勇敢，但是性情柔和，不爱说话。这个矿工出身的人是那样纯良，当他猝然遭受枪弹袭击，倒在地下时，他最后说的一句话是：“这是世界问题，宁可牺牲自己……。”这时他手中有枪，枪膛里有子弹，可是他没有射击。他至死忠诚地遵守了谈判协议。让这和平战士的血来揭露那些美国谋杀者的卑鄙吧。但朝鲜老母亲如同抱着自己的亲儿子一样地抱紧他，痛哭恳求：“不要把姚庆祥送回中国，把他留给我们朝鲜吧！他为了我们朝鲜人，把他永远留在我们朝鲜吧。”姚庆祥是死了也还活在人间的那种人。前线的战士们都牢牢记住，他从前无论在刮风的黑夜，在落雨的黎明，总是走到哨岗上来巡视。那时他叮嘱战士说：“我们要耐心啊，为了和平任务……。”今天人们用他的名字宣誓：“把工作做好”，“把警戒任务完成”。千百万战士组成坚强的前线，保卫开城，保卫和平。想一想这样真正的人，这样斗争的忠心是多么庄严的现实。谁在破坏和平，谁在保卫和平，让庄严的现实发言吧。
    板门店的停战谈判已经从一个夏天到了另一个夏天，帐篷褪了色，可是开城人民对争取和平的决心更加强了。“开城新闻”编辑部门口，每天没到出版时间就挤满了人。他们问谈判的进展。人民的眼睛雪亮，已经识透了这些美国强盗，他们的“人道原则”就是在中立区一件又一件制造的血案。现在参加谈判斗争的不仅是一个代表团，开城人民组成整个支援斗争的前哨。五月十四日美机在开城上空低空盘旋，投掷了近三十多颗照明弹，耀眼的白光照明整个城市。可是威胁与欺骗都早已破产。这是满月里一个市民的话：“这些美国人今天干出这样的事，在明天的会议上怎样回答呢？大概他们又会不要脸地说是扔错了。从前不是有一次轰炸，他们以后又说不知道有这样一回事吗？”
    美国强盗每天发炮，把成吨的钢铁倾倒在我们阵地上。但是如果真的进攻，他们是永远也得不到任何微小利益的。最近美国军队在板门店旁边发动的一次攻击就是一个实例。我恰好在那一天访问我们的前线。从一处瞭望哨清清楚楚看见板门店正在举行会议的帐篷，看见砂川河那边的美军前沿，看见耸立着高架电线的我们伸得最远的前哨阵地。就在这时，美军正猛烈地向那儿攻击。阳光下闪着一团团蓝色的炮火烟球，坦克在那小山岗后扫起一片黄色烟尘。听！机枪正雨点般紧响，我们的英雄们已经在迎击敌人。当晚我从我们微笑的指挥员那里得到胜利消息，我们的英雄拿炸弹欢迎了敌人，美国侵略军的尸体就爬在我们阵地前面了。反坦克炮手也显出了威风，一阵打毁了六辆坦克。这时我笑了，因为我记起前几天在板门店访问的时候，每天会议一开始，美方的炮弹就震动着谈判的桌子。当时我心里很生气，现在这不就是我们开城前线保卫和平的战士对敌人的回答吗？
    前线连部拿炮弹壳养活着鲜花，我看见同样鲜花开放在城里工厂的办公桌上。从前线到后方，战争中细小的生活情节常常有一种密切联系。我到开城工厂和农村访问了第一批在废墟上恢复生产建设的劳动模范。我在纺织厂访问女工金贞林。在这里，烧毁的墙基上架起新的木棚，鼓舞劳动热情的标语出现在有弹痕的墙壁上，车间里送出第一批新的棉毛线。这个工厂供应着开城的纺织户。我不打算白天访问发电站，因为我想看看夜间发电站怎样供给每个家庭以温暖和幸福。电工方应良穿着白毛线衣和我们会面。发电站是美国侵略者撤退时有计划破坏的。方应良在寒冷的冬天的许多日子里，衣着单薄，不停地工作。他和金贞林一样不愿讲自己的功绩。他只微微一笑说：“那时连吸一枝烟的时间也没有。”他的妻子还住在沙里院地窑里。可是千百盏电灯却在开城居民屋顶下发亮。那天我在崔仁镇家屋廊下看见小孩子在灯下读书，母亲在灯下折叠洗净的衣裳。
    我访问工厂之后访问了农村。端午节刚过，又落了一阵及时雨。农村里正是农忙的季节。布谷鸟一声声叫着，在那一望无际的水田里到处都是穿白衣裳的人在插秧。在这个暖烘烘的晌午，增产模范金泽庆也下田去了。村党部委员长朴声镇，这个负伤退伍军人代他接见我们。他笑嘻嘻告诉我：“金泽庆可热心呢！他今年头一个采用新的生产方法。他准备增产三倍粮食。”当我们漫谈下去以后，朴声镇坐在他屋廊下慢慢卷着纸烟，告诉我一个非常动人的故事。他说从前有一部分中国人民志愿军部队住在这个村庄里，可是有一天他们接受命令开拔上前线去了。他们走后，村庄里突然像失去亲人。小孩子们都感到寂寞。不久以前的一个早晨，一群老母亲就顺着道路上前线去了。她们冒着炮火的危险在阵地上找到了亲人。于是在堑壕里展开了相互的慰问，朝鲜母亲们都流了泪。战士们留她们在阵地上愉快地过了一天。我喜欢这个故事，我很久很久地思索这个真实的故事。因为我在开城看到了残酷的战争罪迹，听到了深沉的申诉。但我得说，我愈来愈清楚地看到人民深厚的爱。这种深厚的爱在战斗中生长着。战争的火焰烧毁了古老的城市，但新的城市又在火焰中诞生。这几天月色清明。深夜我站立在我屋前的平台上望着整个开城。这时在我耳边就升起那天在工厂里听到的十分愉快的歌声，他们一阵又一阵地唱“金日成”，唱“阿里郎”，唱“东方红”。我知道这劳动者愉快的歌声和前线战士庄严的誓言是多么亲近。同时，战士们坚强镇定的意志又和这个农村里的故事怎样紧密地相联。今天朝鲜土地还在燃烧，今天朝鲜人民还在流血，可是关于和平的问题我们不难得到答案。我们保卫和平的力量愈战愈强，这力量就将争取朝鲜和平的胜利。
