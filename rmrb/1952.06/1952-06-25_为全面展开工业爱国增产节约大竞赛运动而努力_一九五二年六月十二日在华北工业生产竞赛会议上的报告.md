    Strive to Fully Launch the Industrial Patriotic Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    – Report at the North China Industrial Production Competition Conference on June 12, 1952
    Liu Xiufeng
    The first patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign in the entire North China region is about to fully commence. This is a widespread mass competition movement across all industrial and mining enterprises, launched under Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy and on the victorious foundation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. The scale of the movement is extremely broad, encompassing both increased production and practicing economy, both improving quality and reducing costs; it is being carried out not only in production and management departments, but also in basic construction departments. Its development will have a significant impact on the improvement of production and the advancement of operational management in industrial and mining enterprises.
    (I) The Tasks and Conditions of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.
    The main tasks of the industrial increase production and practice economy competition are: first, to increase production and practice economy for the country by four trillion yuan; second, to further promote production reforms and lay a preliminary foundation for the implementation of a comprehensive economic accounting system.
    The task is glorious, but arduous. This year's industrial production target is 37% higher than last year's (excluding railways), and the four trillion yuan in increased production and practiced economy is the amount increased in addition to the completion of this target. In addition, since the focus was on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns in the first half of the year, only the planned tasks were completed in production. Therefore, the annual increase production and practice economy tasks must be completed in the second half of the year, and it is particularly important to lay the foundation for scientific management, planned management, and economic accounting during this half-year competition, and to learn the necessary basic experience to welcome the arrival of large-scale planned economic construction.
    Can it be completed? It will be completed if everyone works hard, because this competition movement is being launched under several favorable conditions. 1. First and foremost, Chairman Mao's great call has been embraced by the broad masses of workers and will transform into a great mass material force, driving the competition movement forward. 2. The leadership's focus has shifted to industrial and mining enterprises, and in particular, tens of thousands of cadres have been transferred to industrial and mining enterprises, adding significant strength. 3. This movement is being launched on the victorious foundation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. The workers' class consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, not only clarifying ideological boundaries but also spontaneously launching a wave of competition. The "Three-Anti" campaign not only carried out the anti-corruption and anti-bureaucracy movement, but also prominently carried out the anti-waste movement, which is of great significance in completing the practice economy tasks and improving enterprise management. Secondly, in terms of engineering and technical personnel, ideological remolding movements were carried out, and their European and American bourgeois ideological viewpoints, work styles, purely technical viewpoints, and vestiges of the old society were powerfully criticized by the masses and they made self-criticisms. Some of them progressed slowly in the past, but now it's a leap forward. At the same time, the bureaucratic and unprincipled conciliatory erroneous thinking of some factory and mine leaders has also been criticized, strengthening the mass viewpoint, and the idea of relying on the masses of workers to run factories well has become even clearer. These have laid a favorable foundation for this competition movement, the promotion of advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and the workers. 4. Industrial and mining enterprises in various parts of North China have carried out competitions, and workers, staff, technical personnel, and leading cadres in various regions have varying degrees of experience, which will also be very useful for us in carrying out this competition.
    Are there any unfavorable conditions in the competition movement? Temporary unfavorable situations also exist, such as problems with supply and sales, product backlogs in various places, and sluggish sales. Is this situation caused by overproduction and market shrinkage? No. This is due to the market not yet recovering after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, business institutions not fully returning to normal, material exchanges not being smooth, the psychology of private industrialists and businessmen not yet fully turning around, the postponement of basic construction projects, and the untimely allocation and supply of materials. This situation is serious, especially for a specific industrial and mining unit, it will have a direct impact. But can this situation be overcome? It can be overcome. Analyzing from the overall situation, since imperialism has been driven out, there is no imperialist competition; since land reform is gradually being completed nationwide, the purchasing power of farmers will gradually increase; since the people of the whole country will continue to vigorously support the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, since the tasks of economic construction are expanding, and since municipal construction funds are increasing, the demand for industrial products will continue to increase rapidly. Overall, it is still industrial backwardness and insufficient industrial production, not overproduction. In particular, North China's wheat harvest this year is abundant, and the autumn harvest is promising, the purchasing power of rural areas will be even higher. Therefore, in addition to a small number of industries and businesses that will inevitably be affected due to blind development or being detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood, the entire enterprise, not only state-owned and public-owned have great development prospects, but also private industrialists and businessmen can obtain reasonable development, and the economy will quickly prosper. The current issue is how to quickly replenish institutions, educate management and trade cadres, correct the phenomenon of unwillingness to do economic work and unwillingness to deal with capitalists, actively organize material exchange work, open up sales channels, and quickly start basic construction projects, then the situation will quickly turn around. Therefore, we have the confidence to complete and exceed the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy.
    (II) Quickly Make Preparations and Actively Launch the Competition.
    1. Completely end the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, quickly adjust institutions, allocate cadres, and shift the leadership focus to production, basic construction, and management.
    2. Mobilize all employees to discuss the factory and mine's plan to increase production and practice economy. Formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy for workshops (pits and wells), teams, individuals, departments, and sections; formulate plans and specific goals to ensure basic construction tasks, improve project quality, and reduce costs. Only after plans have been discussed and revised by the masses can they be transformed into a material force to mobilize the masses and become the masses' fighting goals. This competition is a long-term, comprehensive competition movement, and all personnel must participate without exception. Not only production and basic construction personnel must formulate plans, but also materials and management departments must formulate supply and sales plans, using competition to promote the sales of backlogged products and ensure the supply of materials and supplies on time, in quantity, quality, and specifications. A slight oversight by the planning and design department can cause huge waste. It is necessary to learn from advanced experience, do a good job in planning and design, and go deep into the masses and workshops to check the implementation of the plans. The production and technical departments should formulate plans for promoting advanced technologies and advanced working methods, and go deep into the site, workshops, and pits to promote them, and quickly process various rationalization proposals; the labor department should formulate plans to ensure safety and hygiene equipment; the security department should formulate plans on how to fight against counter-revolutionaries to prevent sabotage; and the general affairs and health departments should all have their plans to ensure the smooth implementation of the competition. In short, heroes and models can be produced by people working in various positions.
    3. On the foundation of the "Three-Anti" movement, restore the original good systems in production management, and establish new systems to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns. Improve the workshop's planning, statistics, and reporting system, improve the material management, product inspection, machine maintenance, and inspection system, and improve the responsibility system and liaison contract system, etc.
    4. Do a good job of machine maintenance, reduce machine failures and accidents, and make the necessary preparations for production tools and raw materials to ensure the exertion of labor productivity. At the same time, carry out inspection and repair work on safety equipment, pay attention to ventilation and hygiene equipment in the factory, protect the safety of workers' production and physical health, and reduce liability accidents. This year, it is particularly important to ensure safe production and protect the health of workers during the summer competition, and issues that are possible and urgently needed to be resolved should be resolved as soon as possible.
    We must prepare the main work well, not everything. Some of the above requirements must be completed before the competition, and some can be continued during the competition. With the main conditions in place, we can quickly enter the competition. Some units have already started, and some plans have been postponed. Now it is determined that July 1st will be the date for the full launch of the competition in the entire region. There are only half a month left, so we must work hard to prepare the most necessary work and do a good job in mobilizing and discussing the plans in depth.
    (III) Different industries and different factories and mines should have different requirements for increasing production and practicing economy.
    The general requirements for the competition are to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and accelerate the turnover of working capital to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy. However, due to the existence of an imbalance between production and sales, in order to overcome the generality and blindness of the competition, different requirements and focuses should be determined according to the different circumstances of each factory and mine.
    1. For factories and mines where there are no problems with the supply of raw materials and the sales of products, the requirements are to increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, and practice economy in working capital at the same time. Such as iron, coke, machinery, cement, paper making, etc.
    2. For factories and mines that currently have a large backlog of products but will have sales in the future, the requirements are to complete according to plan, no longer increase output, and focus on improving quality, practicing economy, reducing costs, implementing economic accounting, and reducing prices to open up sales channels. Such as coal mines, state-owned coal mines are only required to complete the original increased production plan, provincial and local coal mines should be reduced to last year's output level. The focus should be on reducing costs (saving raw materials, such as pillar, detonator and other consumption), promoting mechanized scientific management, safe production, and especially focusing on basic construction aspects of geological survey, drilling, establishing new wells or restoring old wells design work, digging more to prepare for next year's recovery work. Such as the power industry, the general focus is on adjusting the load, ensuring safe power transmission, reducing coal consumption, trying to use low-quality coal, and reducing costs. The cigarette, match, flour, and wool textile industries are also the same, and it is appropriate to maintain the original control figures of the central ministries. The general policy is to reward the advanced; those who do not urgently seek improvement will be eliminated.
    3. Cotton textiles and hemp textiles have no sales problems. Cotton textiles have raw material supply problems, as long as the cotton yarn and cloth company can solve the raw material allocation, the output can be increased as much as possible. No new hemp bag factories can be built, but production can be increased.
    4. For the production of receiving institutions, larger factories and mines that have the conditions can participate in the competition; others should continue to be rectified, and the work should be done in a planned way to integrate the scattered, concentrate manpower and financial resources to do this work well. Individual units that have no prospects should be resolutely stopped without delay.
    (IV) Promote advanced work experience in a planned and organized manner.
    Promoting advanced work experience in a planned manner is a key issue in completing and exceeding the competition tasks. In the past, workers and staff in various factories and mines in North China have made many technical improvements and created advanced methods, and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union has also been successful, but planned and organized promotion has been very insufficient. In the competition movement, technical and advanced methods of decisive significance in a department, an industry, and a unit should be promoted, seizing the decisive link to promote the entire chain forward so that production efficiency can be significantly improved. For example, the railway's 500-kilometer movement with full load and super-axis is a comprehensive indicator and call including a variety of advanced methods, which makes the Li Xikui shunting method, Yang Maolin loading method... more universal.
    We must systematically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, because it has absorbed the rational parts of capitalist production technology, and also has thirty years of experience in socialist workers' technical creation and management. Each industry has a complete and systematic set of experiences. It is the most advanced experience and is Marxism-Leninism plus technology. Only by learning it in a planned and vigorous manner, and learning it quickly, can we change our backward state more quickly. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union must be combined with the specific conditions of China and the specific conditions of each factory and mine. If we can quickly master the experience of the Soviet Union, we can, like the workers of the Soviet Union, create and develop better on a new basis, such as Wang Guanghua, who studied in the Soviet Union.
    It is necessary to promote the existing technical improvements, advanced experience, and advanced working methods of the broad masses of workers, and pay attention to new creations, individual and collective rationalization proposals, to call for brainstorming, finding tricks, and giving play to the creativity of the broad masses of workers.
    Promoting advanced experience requires strong leadership, and planned and step-by-step efforts. It is necessary to make plans for specific measures, to take a series of organizational work, to hold technical professional meetings to exchange advanced experience, to organize visits and on-site technical performances, short-term training, etc.
    (V) Do a good job of determination, establish workshop costs, and lay the foundation for the economic accounting system.
    In the competition process, the spread of advanced experience and the adoption of rationalization proposals will inevitably lead to a leap in production levels. Another major link in promoting production reform in this process is to carry out determination work. We must do a good job of determining working hours and raw material consumption, explore equipment potential, determine machine efficiency, and find new production quotas and personnel quotas. This is a key issue in production management and a process of systematic fact-finding. From the actual determination of working hours, find out the causes of waste and loss of working hours and solve them. A comprehensive range of issues, including factory and mine equipment, material supply, labor organization, worker labor, and the production process, as well as the responsibilities of leaders and those being led, can be exposed in this work. Zhang Zhenguo, an advanced worker in Nankou, found that production time only accounted for 18.4% of a working day in the first determination. After making improvements based on the problems found and re-determining, production time increased to 61% of a working day, and production increased by three to seven times. Determining raw material consumption quotas can reflect the real situation of material consumption, find out waste and losses, and improve them. Reducing material consumption and working hours, and saving labor and materials, are the basic factors for reducing costs. At the same time, based on the determination results, it is necessary to resolutely implement fixed staffing according to economic needs, and provide retraining for surplus workers or have them learn technology to cultivate talent for the country. For economic accounting, their wages can not be included in production costs, but included in basic construction investment.
    In the competition process, we must consciously establish workshop costs (wellhead costs) and focus on promoting team economic accounting to lay the foundation for the implementation of a comprehensive economic accounting system. If a team can establish statistical reports, make team and individual plans, find tricks, tap potential, calculate detailed accounts, make rationalization proposals, save working hours, save materials and tools, reduce various consumption and increase production, and conduct team costs, then workshop costs and factory costs will have a reliable foundation. True cost management is by no means simple technical work, and can only be done well by relying on the masses.
    In the competition process, we must systematically establish statistics and planning work so that statistics and planning work is based on reliable basic statistics. Not only is it required to establish a monthly reporting system for major products in important factories and units, but also to gradually establish a daily reporting system so that the leadership can understand the situation in a timely manner, solve problems in a timely manner, and maintain a uniform and rhythmic improvement in production. Large-scale planned economy is coming soon, and our statistics and planning work must lay the foundation this year, otherwise it will be passive and make the plan unable to play a guiding role.
    Business management is also a major link in the economic accounting system. The focus of this department in the competition is to accelerate the turnover of working capital and do a good job in management and sales. It is necessary to closely integrate with state-owned trade and cooperative departments, improve relations with trade departments, disclose costs publicly on the basis of the "Three-Anti," do not conceal each other, appropriately stipulate the profits of both parties, sign sales contracts and processing contracts, both parties must conduct economic accounting, take care of both parties, and have a sense of overall situation. The financial and economic committees of each province and city shall be responsible for systematically resolving this issue ideologically and in work. We do not have a precise production and sales balance plan now, so we still need to improve management according to market needs. Industrial management departments cannot only rely on trade departments or sit at home and wait. They must actively open up sales channels and promote sales to rural areas and outside the region; they should lower prices to seek small profits and quick turnover and accelerate capital turnover. If capital turnover is very difficult, in addition to stepping up sales work, loans can be obtained from banks to solve the difficulties in capital and production.
    North China has a considerable amount of basic construction tasks this year, and most of them have not yet started. In the competition process, strong cadres must be dispatched to strengthen the leadership of basic construction work. They must get involved and learn in order to avoid repeating the mistakes exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns and to ensure and exceed the increase production and practice economy tasks in basic construction. At the same time, we must organize a competition for geological survey and drilling work, a competition for design and planning personnel, and a competition for learning advanced experience to achieve correct surveys, correct designs, and correct construction to improve project quality, reduce consumption, and reduce costs.
    (VI) On the issue of competition rewards.
    There is no major dispute on the issue of competition rewards. In the North China region, a unified reward method cannot be formulated. Only the experiences of various places can be introduced for reference. In the reward method, industries and regions should take care of each other and not be too different. At the same time, different methods should be formulated according to different requirements and their model deeds. The rewards should be appropriate and depend on the specific situation and the specific results of increased production and practiced economy. Rewards are divided into collective awards and individual awards, political awards and material awards. Collective awards are given to model factories, banks, bureaus, sections, stations, model workshops, and teams. Individual awards are not limited to staff, workers, engineering and technical personnel, medical staff, security staff, service personnel, etc. As long as there are inventions and creations, as long as they are models and heroes, they should be rewarded. Responsible persons of factories, bureaus, party committees, trade unions, and leagues can all be commended and rewarded. Secondly, the scope of rewards should be appropriately broadened. If too few rewards are given, it cannot reflect the actual situation in production competition and encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses. However, rewards cannot be given equally. Different rewards should be implemented according to the size of their contribution and the level of their merits, and special awards should be given to outstanding figures. Rewards are the best way to combine national interests with personal interests, and the leadership must use a certain portion of the factory manager's fund for rewards.
    (VII) Unify competition leadership and strengthen political work.
    The key to the success of the competition movement lies in unified and strong leadership. The competition is the task of the whole party and also the focus of government work. There must be a unified leadership organization. Each province and city, under the leadership of the government at the same level, organizes a patriotic increase production and practice economy movement committee, absorbing responsible comrades from various systems to participate, and establishing an office. The party, government, trade union, and league work together under the leadership of the party, and carry out appropriate division of labor. Through each system, they play their different roles in various aspects. This realizes unified leadership and gives play to the role of each system.
    Strengthening political work in the competition movement is very important. The competition is a process of combining leadership with the masses and implementing the mass line. Only by truly believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses can it be done well. At the same time, it is a process of continuously promoting advanced experience, continuously concentrating new advanced experience and rationalization proposals, analyzing and studying them, improving them, and promoting them in a timely manner. The leadership should be good at listening to the opinions of workers and technical personnel, and also be good at criticizing the erroneous conservative views, reactionary thoughts, and old work styles of British and American capitalism to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement. We must strictly guard against the sabotage of reactionary elements and protect the smooth progress of the competition. We must rely on the workers, unite technical personnel, and use competition to implement management democratization and improve relations in all aspects to unite and enter the high tide of the increase production and practice economy movement.
    Comrades! The region-wide competition movement is about to fully commence. In this great movement, thousands of model figures, thousands of model teams, model workshops, and dozens of model factories and mines will surely emerge. Tens of thousands of cadres will be involved in this upsurge, accelerating the learning of scientific management and familiarizing themselves with business! We must gain experience and welcome the arrival of the high tide of economic construction. Under the leadership of the Central Committee and with the help and guidance of the central ministries, we will surely successfully complete this great task and loudly respond to Chairman Mao's call.

    为全面展开工业爱国增产节约大竞赛运动而努力
    ——一九五二年六月十二日在华北工业生产竞赛会议上的报告
    刘秀峰
    华北全区第一次爱国增产节约大竞赛运动，即将全面开始了。这是普遍全区工矿企业的大竞赛运动，是在毛主席伟大的增产节约号召下和在“三反”、“五反”胜利的基础上展开的。运动的规模，极其广泛，既增产又节约，既提高质量，又降低成本；既在生产、经营部门开展，又在基本建设部门开展。它的发展，对于工矿企业生产的提高，经营管理的改进，都将会起很大的影响。
    （一）增产节约运动的任务和条件。
    工业增产节约竞赛的主要任务：一是为国家增产节约四万亿元；二是进一步推动生产上的改革，打下实行全面经济核算制的初步基础。
    任务是光荣的，但是艰巨的。今年的工业生产任务比去年增加百分之三十七（铁路不在内），增产节约四万亿元是在完成这个任务以外所增加的数目。此外，由于上半年集中力量搞“三反”、“五反”，在生产上仅仅完成计划任务，因此全年的增产节约任务，要靠后半年的时间去完成，而特别重要的是要在这半年竞赛中，打下科学管理、计划管理和经济核算的基础，学会必要的起码的经验，以迎接大规模的有计划的经济建设的到来。
    能否完成呢？只要大家努力，是会完成的，因为这次的竞赛运动是在几种有利条件下展开的。1、首先是毛主席的伟大号召，受到广大职工的拥护，会变成伟大的群众物质力量，推动竞赛运动前进。2、领导重点已转到工矿企业，特别是上万的干部调到工矿企业中，增加了很大的力量。3、是在
    “三反”、“五反”运动的胜利基础上开展这一运动，工人的阶级觉悟空前提高，不仅划清了思想界限，而且自动地展开了竞赛的热潮。“三反”运动中不仅进行了反贪污、反官僚主义运动，而且突出地进行了反浪费运动，这在完成节约任务及改进企业管理上有重大的意义。其次在工程技术人员方面，开展了思想改造运动，他们的欧美资产阶级的思想观点、作风，单纯技术观点，旧社会的遗毒，受到了群众的有力批判，并做了自我检讨；他们过去有的是在缓慢地进步，而现在则是一个跃进。同时有些厂矿领导方面的官僚主义和无原则地迁就的错误思想，也受到了批判，加强了群众观点，依靠职工群众办好工厂的思想更进一步地明确了。这些都给这次开展竞赛运动、推广苏联和职工创造的先进经验打好有利的基础。4、华北各地工矿企业都开展过竞赛，各地的工人、职员、技术人员及领导干部都有着不同程度的经验，这些经验对我们此次竞赛的开展，也是很有用的。
    竞赛运动中有没有不利的条件呢？暂时不利情况也是存在的，比如供销上的问题，各地产品积压，销路不畅等。这种情况是否由于生产过剩、市场缩小而引起的呢？不是的。这是由于“三反”、“五反”运动以后，市场尚未恢复，业务机构未完全复常，物资交流也未畅通，私营工商业者的心气尚未完全扭转过来，基本建设工程推迟，物资调拨、供应不及时而发生的现象。这种情况是严重的，特别对于一个具体工矿单位，会发生直接的影响。但是这种情况能不能克服呢？是能够克服的。从总的情况来分析，由于帝国主义已被赶出去，没有帝国主义的竞争；由于土地改革在全国范围内的逐步完成，农民购买力会日渐提高；由于全国人民还要继续大力支援抗美援朝战争，由于经济建设任务扩大，由于市政建设经费增加等，工业品的需要还要迅速加大。总的看来，还是工业落后，工业生产不足，而不是生产过剩。特别是今年华北小麦丰收，秋收有望，农村购买力更会提高。因此，除了少数工商业因盲目发展或不利于国计民生而必然受到影响者外，整个企业不仅国营、公营大有发展前途，而且私营工商业者也可得到合理的发展，经济会很快地繁荣起来。现在的问题是如何迅速充实机构，对经营和贸易干部进行教育，纠正不愿做经济工作，不愿和资本家打交道的现象，积极组织物资交流工作，打开销路，迅速开始基本建设工程，情况就会很快扭转过来的。因而我们有信心完成并超过增产节约的任务。
    （二）迅速做好准备工作，积极开展竞赛。
    一、全部结束“三反”、“五反”，迅速调整机构，配备干部，把领导重点转到生产、基本建设和经营方面来。
    二、发动全体职工讨论厂矿增产节约的计划。制定车间（坑井）小组、个人、各部门、各科室的增产节约计划；制定保证基本建设任务、提高工程质量、减少成本的计划与具体目标。计划只有经过群众讨论与修改，才能变为动员群众的物质力量，才能成为群众的奋斗目标。此次竞赛是一个长期的、全面的竞赛运动，所有人员都要无例外地参加，不仅是生产、基本建设人员要制定计划，材料、经营部门也同样要订出供销计划，用竞赛的方式来推销积压的产品，保证按时间、数量、质量和规格供应材料、物料。计划设计部门稍一不慎就可造成巨大浪费，应学习先进经验，作好计划与设计工作，并深入群众与车间检查计划的执行。生产技术部门则是要作好推广先进技术和先进工作方法的计划，并深入现场、车间、坑井去推广，迅速处理各种合理化建议；劳动部门作出保证安全、卫生设备的计划；保卫部门作好如何和反革命作斗争以防止破坏的计划；总务、卫生部门都应有其保证竞赛顺利执行的计划。总之，各种不同工作岗位工作的人，都可产生英雄和模范。
    三、在“三反”运动基础上，恢复原有的在生产管理上的各种好的制度，并建立新的制度，以巩固“三反”、“五反”的成果。健全车间计划、统计、表报制度，健全材料管理、产品检验、机器检修和检查制度、健全专责制和联系合同等制度。
    四、作好机器检修，减少机器故障和意外事故，作好生产工具和原料的必要准备，以保证劳动生产率的发挥。同时进行安全设备的检查、修补工作，注意厂内通风和卫生设备，保护职工安全生产和身体健康，减少责任事故。今年在夏季开展竞赛，保证安全生产和保护职工健康显得特别重要，应该解决可能而又急需解决的问题，并须尽速解决。
    要把主要的工作准备好，不是事事准备好。上述要求有的须在竞赛前作好，有的可在竞赛过程中去继续完成。主要的条件有了，即可迅速地投入竞赛。现在已有少数单位开始了，有的计划推迟一些。现在确定七月一日为全区全面开展竞赛的日期，现在仅有半个多月了，要努力作好最必需的工作，作好动员和深入讨论计划的工作。
    （三）不同的工业和不同的厂矿，增产节约要有不同的要求。
    竞赛的总要求是增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，加速流动资金周转，以达到增产节约的目的。但由于产销不平衡的状态存在，为了克服竞赛的一般性和盲目性，要按各厂矿不同情况，决定不同的要求和重点。
    一、凡原料供应、产品销路没有问题的厂矿，要求增加产量、提高质量、降低成本、节约流动资金并重。如铁、焦炭、机器、水泥、造纸等。
    二、目前产品积压很多，但将来会有销路的厂矿，要求按计划完成，不再增加产量，重点是提高质量，厉行节约，降低成本，实行经济核算，减低价格，打开销路。如煤矿，国营煤矿只要求完成原增产计划的产量，省营、地方煤矿，要降到去年的产量水平。其重点应着重降低成本（节省原材料，如支柱、雷管等消耗），推行机械化科学管理，安全生产，而特别着重基本建设方面的地质勘查、钻探，建立新井或恢复旧井的设计工作，多掘进为明年回采作准备工作。如电业，一般地重点是调整负荷，保证安全送电，降低煤耗，试用劣质煤，降低成本。纸烟、火柴、面粉、毛纺业，也是同样情况，以维持中央各部原控制数字为妥。总的方针是奖励先进；如不亟谋改进，落后的是要被淘汰的。
    三、棉纺织、麻纺销路没有问题。棉纺是原料供应问题，只要花纱布公司原料调配能解决，可以尽量提高产量。麻袋不能再建新厂，但可增加生产。
    四、接收之机关生产，较大厂矿有条件者可参加竞赛；其他应继续进行整顿，有计划地化零为整，集中人力财力办好这一工作。个别确无前途之单位，坚决停止，不必拖延。
    （四）有计划地有组织地推广先进工作经验。
    有计划地推广先进工作经验，是完成和超过竞赛任务的一个关键问题。过去华北各厂矿职工群众有不少的技术改进和先进方法的创造，学习苏联先进经验也是有成绩的，但有计划、有组织的推广，是十分不够的。竞赛运动中要把一部门、一产业、一单位有决定意义的技术和先进方法，加以推广，抓住决定的环节，来推动整个链子前进，使生产效率可以突出地提高。如铁路满载超轴五百公里运动，是包括多种先进方法的综合性指标和号召，是使李锡奎调车法、杨茂林装车法……等更加普遍化。
    我们要系统地学习苏联的先进经验，因为它是吸收了资本主义生产技术合理部分，而又有三十年社会主义职工的技术创造与管理的经验，各产业都有完整系统的一套，它是最先进的经验，是马克思列宁主义加技术。我们只有有计划地大力地学，而且要学得快，才能更快地改变我们的落后状态。学习苏联的先进经验要和中国的具体情况相结合，和各厂矿的具体条件相结合。我们如能迅速掌握苏联的经验，我们会和苏联的职工一样，可以在新的基础上更有好的创造和发展，如在苏联学习的王光华一样。
    要推广广大职工的已有技术改进、先进经验和先进工作方法，并注意新的创造，个人的与集体的合理化建议，要号召开脑筋、找窍门，发挥广大职工的创造性。
    推广先进经验要有强有力的领导，有计划、有步骤地去作，要作出具体措施的计划，要采取一系列组织工作，召开技术专业会议交流先进经验，组织参观和现场的技术表演、短期训练等。
    （五）作好查定工作，建立车间成本，打下经济核算制的基础。
    在竞赛过程中，由于先进经验的推广，合理化建议的采用，必然使生产水平飞跃地提高。在此过程中推动生产改革的又一重大环节就是进行查定工作。要做好查定工时和查定原材料消耗，发掘设备潜力，查定机器效能，找出新的生产定额和人员定额来，这是生产管理上的关键问题，也是系统地摸底实查的过程。从实际查定工时的过程中，找出工时的浪费和损失的原因，进行解决。厂矿设备情况，材料供应，劳动组织，工人劳动及生产过程中的全面问题，领导和被领导的责任，都能在这一工作中暴露出来。南口张振国先进工作者在第一次查定时，生产时间只占一工作日的百分之十八点四，第二次根据发现的问题作了改进再查定时，生产时间提高到占一工作日的百分之六十一，生产品提高三倍至七倍。从查定材料消耗定额中可反映出材料消费的真实情况，找出浪费和损失，加以改进。降低材料消耗，降低工时，省工、省料，是降低成本的基本因素。同时根据查定的结果，要坚决地按经济需要，实行定员，把富余的工人进行轮训或要他们学技术，为国家培养人材，为了经济核算，其工资可不计入生产成本，而列入基本建设投资。
    在竞赛过程中，要有意识地建立车间成本（井口成本），有重点地推行小组经济核算的工作，以便为实行全面的经济核算制打下基础。假若一个小组能建立统计表报，能作出小组的和个人的计划，能找窍门，挖潜力，算细账，提合理化建议，节约工时，节省物料与工具，降低各种消耗并增加生产，进行小组的成本，那末车间成本，厂成本就有了可靠的基础。真正的成本管理决不是简单的技术工作，只有依靠群众，才能作好。
    在竞赛过程中，要有系统地建立起统计、计划工作，使统计、计划工作建立在基层统计的可靠基础上。不仅要求在重要工厂单位上建立主要产品的月报制，而且要逐渐建立日报制度，以便领导方面及时了解情况，及时解决问题，使生产能保持均匀的有节奏的上进。大规模的计划经济即将到来，我们的统计、计划工作必须在今年打下基础，否则就会被动，使计划不能发挥指导作用。
    经营管理工作也是经济核算制的一个主要环节。这个部门在竞赛中的重点就是加速流动资金的周转，搞好经营和供销工作，要和国营贸易、合作部门密切结合，改善和贸易部门的关系，在“三反”的基础上公开成本，互不隐瞒，适当地规定双方的利润，订立包销合同，加工合同，双方都要经济核算，要照顾双方，要识大体。各省、市财政经济委员会要负责从思想上、工作上系统地加以解决。我们现在没有精确的产销平衡计划，故仍需视市场的需要来改善经营。工业经营管理部门不能只靠贸易部门或坐在家里等待，要积极打开销路，向农村向区外推销；应降低价格，以求薄利多销，加速资金周转。如资金周转十分困难时，除加紧推销工作外，可向银行借贷，以解决资金和生产中的困难。
    华北区今年有相当大的基本建设任务，现在多数尚未开工。在竞赛过程中，必须派遣强的干部加强基本建设工作的领导，要钻进去学会，才能避免再犯“三反”、“五反”中所暴露出来的错误，才能保证和超过基本建设方面的增产节约任务。同时要组织地质勘查钻探工作的竞赛，要展开设计、计划人员的竞赛，要展开学习先进经验的竞赛，要达到正确的勘查，正确的设计，正确的施工，以提高工程的质量，减低消耗，降低成本。
    （六）关于竞赛奖励问题。
    竞赛的奖励问题，是没有大的争论了。在华北区还不能拟定统一的奖励办法，只可介绍各地的经验作为参考。在奖励办法上产业与地区之间，应互相照顾，不要过于悬殊，同时要按着不同要求和其模范事迹订出不同办法，奖励要适当，要看具体情况及具体增产节约的结果。奖励分集体奖和个人奖，政治奖与物质奖。集体奖发给模范厂、行、局、段、站、模范车间和小组。个人奖不分职员、工人、工程技术人员、医务工作人员、保卫工作人员、勤务人员等，只要有发明创造，只要是模范和英雄，都要得到奖励。厂长、局长、党委、工会和团的负责人员，都可得到表扬和奖励。其次奖励的面要适当放宽，奖的过少便不能反映生产竞赛中的实际情况和鼓励广大群众的积极性；但又不能平均主义地发奖，要按其贡献的大小，功绩的高低，实行不同奖励，突出的人物要有特奖。奖励是使国家利益和个人切身利益结合起来的最好办法，领导方面必须把厂长基金的一定部分用在奖励上。
    （七）统一竞赛领导和加强政治工作。
    竞赛运动开展得好坏，关键在于统一的和坚强的领导。竞赛是全党的任务，也是政府工作的重点，要有统一领导的组织。各省市在同级政府领导下，组织爱国增产节约运动委员会，吸收各系统负责同志参加，并设办公机构；厂矿内不设竞赛委员会，由生产管理委员会作为竞赛的领导机构。党、政、工、团在党的领导下拧成一股劲，而又进行适当分工，通过各系统在各个方面发挥其不同的作用，这样既实现了统一领导，而又发挥了各个系统的作用。
    加强竞赛运动中的政治工作，是十分重要的。竞赛是领导与群众相结合、贯彻群众路线的过程，只有认真地相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，才能搞得好，同时又是不断地把先进经验推广下去，不断地把新的先进经验与合理化建议集中上来，加以分析研究和改进，并及时推广下去的过程。领导方面要善于听取职工群众和技术人员的意见，同时又要善于批评错误的英美资本主义的保守观点、反动思想和旧作风，以巩固“三反”运动的成果。要严防反动分子的破坏，保卫竞赛的顺利进行。我们必须依靠职工，团结技术人员，通过竞赛来贯彻管理民主化，来改善各方面的关系，以便团结一致地进入增产节约运动的高潮。
    同志们！全区性的大竞赛运动即将全面开始了。在此伟大的运动中，一定会出现上千的模范人物，上千的模范小组，模范车间和数十个模范厂矿。数万干部投入这一热潮中，加速地学习科学管理和熟悉业务吧！要取得经验，迎接经济建设的高潮的到来。我们在中央领导下，在中央各部帮助指导下，一定能胜利地完成这一伟大任务，响亮地回答毛主席的号召。
