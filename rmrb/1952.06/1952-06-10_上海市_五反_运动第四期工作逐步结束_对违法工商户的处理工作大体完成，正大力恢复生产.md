Shanghai's Fourth Phase of the "Five-Anti" Campaign Gradually Concludes
Handling of Illegal Industrial and Commercial Households Largely Completed; Vigorously Resuming Production

The fourth phase of Shanghai’s "Five-Anti" campaign is gradually coming to an end. The entire "Five-Anti" campaign has now achieved the anticipated great victory. The fourth phase officially began on May 5th. In this phase, in addition to continuing to resolve the remaining issues of illegal industrial and commercial households, the main task was to concentrate efforts on handling cases of industrial and commercial households who had confessed and repented in the previous three phases, and to vigorously restore regular production work. In terms of handling cases, the city and districts established specialized handling work organizations, equipped with strong cadres, and followed the principles stipulated by Chairman Mao: "leniency in the past, strictness in the future; leniency for the majority, strictness for the minority; leniency for those who confess, strictness for those who resist; leniency for industry, strictness for commerce; leniency for ordinary commerce, strictness for speculative commerce," as well as the guideline of "strict struggle, lenient handling." They continued to mobilize workers and meticulously reviewed the confessions and guarantees of each illegal industrial and commercial household. They conducted detailed research and analysis of their illegal activities, the extent of their confession, and the nature of their business; they conscientiously carried out the work of reviewing and finalizing cases, completely writing off items that should not be counted as "five evils," and generally writing off items that could be counted or not. This was done to both eliminate the "five evils" and facilitate unity for production. This work proceeded extremely smoothly due to close reliance on the workers in various factories and shops. To date, the handling work has been largely completed. Except for serious and completely illegal households that must be judged by the People's Court, notices of refunds and tax supplements have been issued to general illegal industrial and commercial households. In order to implement the policy of combining leniency and strictness, the city and district levels have successively established People's Courts to begin handling cases of serious and completely illegal households.

After the end of the third phase of the campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy paid more attention to production work. At the beginning of the fourth phase, the Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy emphasized that "the purpose of the 'Five-Anti' campaign is to improve production, and after the campaign has achieved a basic victory, leadership over production work should be strengthened." To this end, the Municipal Processing and Ordering Committee and the production committees of various districts have been established to specifically lead the production work of private enterprises. During this period, the production committees of various districts conducted investigations and research, and "ranked" industrial and commercial households according to their business nature and production situation, dividing them into three categories: those with normal production, those with temporary difficulties but future development prospects, and those who rely solely on deceiving consumers to start their businesses and have no development prospects and are bound to be eliminated. This was done to provide processing and ordering according to different specific circumstances and assist their production. At the same time, the municipal and district committees for increasing production and practicing economy respectively convened a series of meetings of trade union cadres, worker representatives, staff representatives, capitalists and their agents, and representatives of workers' family members and capitalists' family members to conduct policy and ideological education, repeatedly explaining the significance and purpose of the "Five-Anti" campaign, and calling on workers to actively unite with capitalists who have eliminated the "five evils" and are willing to correct their mistakes to improve production, and prevent capitalists from re-implementing the "five evils." For the capitalists, they were called upon to overcome difficulties, improve management, and at the same time, capitalists' family members were called upon to encourage their husbands, fathers, and brothers to develop production and serve national construction. After these educations, some of the confused thoughts of workers and capitalists were clarified. On this basis, most factories and shops universally convened labor-management consultation meetings, where labor and management negotiated with the focus on improving production. Specific plans were drawn up to overcome difficulties, improve management, and develop production, and production was improved. The Huiming Flashlight Battery Factory in Putuo District solved the problem of labor allocation through labor-management consultation meetings, transferring workers from the battery department, which was facing the off-season and had slow-selling products and therefore no work to do, to making flashlights with good sales, overcoming production difficulties, and both labor and management were very satisfied. The management took the initiative to solve the raw material problem, and the workers organized labor, with skilled workers leading novices, which not only dispelled the workers in the battery department's concerns about "unskilled technology" but also increased output. For example, the hitting room has increased from hitting 1,400 only per day to 2,000 only. Some factories and shops that had closed down before the "Five-Anti" campaign or attempted to resist the "Five-Anti" campaign by stopping work also began to resume production after passing labor-management consultation meetings. In Changning District, eleven factories that had originally stopped work have resumed production in two households after convening labor-management consultation meetings, five households have formulated production plans, and four households have solved funding difficulties. Therefore, the entire Shanghai's industry and commerce gradually presented a new atmosphere.

In the fourth phase of the "Five-Anti" campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy continued to adopt the approach of fully mobilizing workers and capitalists' family members and ordering illegal capitalists to conduct "mutual assistance and mutual evaluation" to solve the problems of remaining illegal industrial and commercial households. By May 25, it had solved the problems of nearly 35,000 illegal industrial and commercial households as expected. Now, the vast majority of industrial and commercial households in the city have solved the "Five-Anti" issue, and the remaining very few will also come to an end in the shortest possible time.

    上海市“五反”运动第四期工作逐步结束
    对违法工商户的处理工作大体完成，正大力恢复生产
    上海市“五反”运动的第四期工作正逐步结束。整个“五反”运动现已获得预期的伟大胜利。第四期工作是在五月五日正式开始的。这一期的主要任务，除了继续解决剩余的违法工商户的问题外，是集中力量对前三期坦白悔过的工商户进行处理工作，并以大力恢复经常的生产工作。在处理工作方面，市、区都成立了专门的处理工作机构，配备了坚强的干部，按照毛主席所规定的“过去从宽、今后从严，多数从宽、少数从严，坦白从宽、抗拒从严，工业从宽、商业从严，普通商业从宽、投机商业从严”的原则和“斗争从严、处理从宽”的方针，继续发动职工，细致认真地审核每一违法工商户的坦白具结书，对他们的违法情形、坦白程度以及营业性质作了精细的研究和分析；切实进行了审核定案工作，不应该计入“五毒”的全部核掉，可计入可不计入的亦一般予以核掉。作到既利于消灭
    “五毒”，又利于团结生产的目的。这一工作由于紧密依靠了各工厂商店的职工群众，进行极为顺利，到目前为止，处理工作已大体完成，除严重违法户和完全违法户须经人民法庭判决外，已对一般违法工商户发给退款补税的通知书。为了贯彻宽大与严肃相结合的政策，市、区两级已先后成立人民法庭，开始处理严重违法户和完全违法户的案件。
    上海市增产节约委员会在运动第三期结束后，更加重视生产工作。在第四期工作开始时，市增产节约委员会即强调指出：“五反”运动的目的是为了搞好生产，在运动已经取得基本胜利之后更应加强对生产工作的领导。为此，市加工定货委员会和各区生产委员会已经成立，专门领导私营企业的生产工作。在这期间，各区生产委员会进行了调查研究工作，按照工商户的营业性质和生产情况进行了工商户“排队”，分为生产正常的暂时有困难而将来有发展前途的以及专靠欺骗消费者起家而没有发展前途势必淘汰的三类，以便按照不同的具体情况分别给予加工定货，扶助其生产。同时，市、区增产节约委员会分别召开一系列的工会干部会、工人代表会、职员代表会、资本家及其代理人会议和职工家属、资本家家属代表会议，进行政策教育和思想教育，反复地说明“五反”运动的意义和目的，号召职工主动团结已经清除“五毒”并愿改过自新的资本家搞好生产，防止资本家再施“五毒”。对于资本家，便号召他们克服困难，改善经营，同时号召资本家家属鼓励自己的丈夫父兄发展生产，为国家建设服务。经过这些教育，职工和资本家的某些混乱思想得到澄清。在这个基础上，大部分的工厂商店普遍召开了劳资协商会议，劳资双方以搞好生产为中心进行协商。订出了克服困难、改善经营、发展生产的具体计划，改进了生产。普陀区汇明电筒电池厂通过劳资协商会议解决了劳动力的调配问题，把面临淡季，产品滞销因而没有活做的电池部工人调配来做有销路的电筒，克服了生产困难，劳资双方都很满意。资方主动解决了原料问题，工人组织了劳动力，由熟练工人带动生手，不仅使电池部工人打消了“技术不熟练”的顾虑，而且提高了产量，如打电间已从每天打一千四百只提高到二千只。一部分在“五反”运动之前即告停业或企图以停工来抗拒“五反”运动的工厂商店，经通过劳资协商会议后，也开始恢复生产。长宁区有十一户原来停工的工厂，在召开劳资协商会议后，已有两户恢复生产，五户订出生产计划，四户解决了资金困难。因此，整个上海市的工商业逐渐呈现了新的气象。
    上海市增产节约委员会在“五反”运动第四期中，继续采取了充分发动职工和资本家家属，责令违法资本家进行“互助互评”，以解决剩余违法工商户的问题。到五月二十五日止，已预期地解决了将近三万五千户违法工商户的问题。现在，全市工商户的绝大多数已解决了“五反”的问题，剩下来的极少数也将在最短期内告一结束。（新华社）
