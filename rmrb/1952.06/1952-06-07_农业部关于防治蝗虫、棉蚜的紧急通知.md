    Ministry of Agriculture's Emergency Notice on the Prevention and Control of Locusts and Cotton Aphids
    This year, the occurrence of pests such as locusts and cotton aphids is generally earlier than in previous years; moreover, the area affected by pests is larger from the outset than it was last year. Recently, urgent telegrams have been received from various regions, and the situation is extremely serious. For example, in Hebei Province, locust nymphs have appeared in seventy counties, covering an area of more than 800,000 mu. In Siyang County, northern Anhui, the area affected by locusts is as large as 300,000 mu, and in areas with high density, a bowl can be filled with a single scoop. Locusts have also been discovered in more than ten counties in Shandong Province, and the area where locusts have emerged in the Huimin Special District is already more than 300,000 mu across six counties. In Guangrao and Kenli counties of these six, the locust egg density is 10 to 40 egg masses per square meter. Currently, it is the peak period of locust egg hatching, and the locust situation will become even more serious. Cotton aphids have become widespread in Shangqiu, Luoyang, and other special districts in Henan Province. In severe cases, there are more than 100 aphids on cotton seedlings that have only just revealed their true leaves; in severe cases in Hebei Province, there are more than 200 aphids per plant. In the face of this serious situation, the Ministry hereby issues the following notice:
    1. We have now entered the decisive stage of the fight against locusts. Summer locusts must be eliminated before mid-June. During this tense stage, all regions must accurately grasp the locust situation, organize the strength of the peasants, and use all possible methods to completely eliminate them. Otherwise, it will not only cause disasters now but also lead to the emergence of autumn locusts, causing even greater harm.
    2. Cotton aphids have become widespread in various regions and are developing rapidly. Regions that have not yet harvested wheat must mobilize peasants to carry out a general treatment once. Regions that have already been treated must continue to thoroughly eliminate the pests. In addition, all regions should seize the opportunity to prepare pesticides and equipment. In regions with sprayers, cooperatives should actively promote sales and mobilize mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to purchase pesticides and equipment, and organize peasants to purchase them jointly, to strengthen the force for aphid control. At the same time, all regions should also pay attention to the prevention and control of red spiders, which harm cotton seedlings. Areas that are busy controlling locusts and neglecting the work of controlling aphids and red spiders should also be corrected in a timely manner.
    Currently, the prevention and control of the above-mentioned pests has become an important key to striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton in 1952. All regions must vigorously mobilize peasants to organize themselves, through mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and appropriately allocate labor to ensure that pest control, production, and flood prevention are carried out simultaneously without neglecting any of them.
                                                Minister Li Shucheng

    农业部关于防治蝗虫、棉蚜的紧急通知
    今年蝗虫、棉蚜等害虫的发生，一般的比往年为早；而且一开始，发生虫害的面积就比去年为大。最近各地迭电告急，情况至为严重。如河北省发生蝗蝻地区已达七十个县，面积有八十多万亩。皖北泗洪一县发生蝗虫的面积就有三十多万亩，而且密度稠的地方用碗一捞就可装满。山东省也有十多县发现了蝗虫，惠民专区六个县蝗虫出土的面积已有三十多万亩。六县中广饶、垦利两县蝗卵密度每平方公尺有十至四十块，最近正是蝗卵孵化盛期，蝗情将更严重。棉蚜在河南省商邱、洛阳等专区已普遍发生，严重者棉苗仅露真叶时就有蚜虫一百多个；河北省严重者每株有蚜虫二百多个。面对这一严重情况，本部特作下列通知：
    一、目前已进入扑蝗斗争的决战时期。夏蝗必须消灭在六月中旬以前，在这一紧张阶段中，各地必须切实掌握蝗情，组织农民力量，用尽各种方法予以彻底消灭。否则不但现在要造成灾害，还会发生秋蝗，遗害更大。
    二、各地棉蚜已普遍发生，正在迅速发展。尚未收麦地区必须发动农民先行普治一次。已经治过的地区须继续彻底除治。此外，各地应即抓紧时机准备药械。有喷雾器的地区合作社应即积极推销，发动互助组和农业生产合作社购买药械，并组织农民合伙购买，以加强治蚜的力量。同时，各地还应注意对危害棉苗的红蜘蛛的防治。某些地区忙于治蝗，而忽略了治蚜和治红蜘蛛工作的，也应及时纠正。
    目前防治上述害虫已成为争取一九五二年粮棉丰收的重要关键，各地必须大力发动农民组织起来，通过互助组，农业生产合作社，适当的调配劳力，做到治虫、生产、防汛三不误。
                                                部长　李书城
                                          一九五二年六月三日
