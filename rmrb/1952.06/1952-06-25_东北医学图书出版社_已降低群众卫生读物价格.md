    Northeast Medical Books Publishing House

    Has Lowered Prices of Mass Health Reading Materials

    To the Editor: The suggestion made by Comrade Yang Chu and two other comrades on reducing the prices of mass health reading materials, published in the "Reader's Letters" page on June 1st, is very correct.

    In the past, the books published by our publishing house had relatively high costs due to the influence of production conditions. Later, after overcoming some objective difficulties, we reduced book prices once in November 1951. On May 11th of this year, in order to cooperate with the Patriotic Health and Epidemic Prevention Campaign, our publishing house lowered book prices for the second time. For example, the book "Methods of Defense Against Germ Warfare" has been reduced from 3,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. In the future, our publishing house will continue to improve production conditions and reduce book prices.

    已降低群众卫生读物价格
    编辑同志：六月一日“读者来信专页”刊登了杨初等三同志对减低群众性卫生读物价格的建议。这一建议是非常正确的。
    过去我社出版的书籍因受生产条件的影响，成本较高。后来克服了一些客观上的困难，曾于一九五一年十一月份降低了一次书价。今年五月十一日，为了配合爱国卫生防疫运动，我社又第二次降低书价。如“细菌战的防御法”一书，已由三千元降低为二千元。今后我社当继续改善生产条件，减低书价。
