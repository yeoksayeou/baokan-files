Lysenko Discusses Soviet Experience in High-Yield Cotton Production

Editor's Note: Last October, Comrade Lysenko, advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and Soviet agricultural expert, went to Shijiazhuang and Handan prefectures in Hebei Province to guide high-yield cotton production. He visited farms in Hebei Province, prefectural farms, and the high-yield cotton fields of model workers Liang Jiarui, Zhang Defang, Song Chenquan, and others, providing on-site guidance. He held a symposium on high-yield cotton production in Handan Prefecture, answering questions raised by attendees regarding difficulties in achieving high-yield cotton production and introducing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in high-yield cotton production. This report is based on his talks and was published in the Hebei Daily on May 28th. The translation published by the Hebei Daily contained several significant errors and omissions. This newspaper version has been carefully reviewed and corrected by Comrade Lysenko before publication. He said that when applying these experiences, it is necessary to base them on the specific conditions of the local area, combined with the high-yield experience of farmers and the experimental results of farms. We believe that this report is of significant guiding significance for China's high-yield cotton production campaign.

The questions raised by everyone are very important and are all related to high yields. However, if we study a single question in isolation from the overall conditions, this is unscientific and will not lead to correct conclusions. It is necessary to make correct judgments based on overall conditions and long-term experiments. Because I have only been here (Handan) for a short time, it is difficult for me to judge the cotton cultivation situation here. Now, I will introduce to you what I know about Soviet cotton cultivation methods:

I. Density of Planting: The density of cotton planting varies depending on the natural conditions of each region and cannot be judged casually. The Soviet Union's dense planting of cotton is based on a combination of scientific principles and the long-term experience of the masses. I will use the experimental results of the Kherson cotton field in Ukraine to illustrate:

(I) Experimental results of cotton density on dry land (sandy loam soil, that is, the upper layer is "sandy loam" and the lower layer is "clay," which the masses call "Mengjin soil"):

(II) Experimental results of cotton density on irrigated land (sandy loam soil):

(The above are the results of natural growth in a general environment, without fertilizer or technical processing.)

From the above table, it can be seen that the relationship between the number of plants and the yield is very close. Therefore, we in the Soviet Union stipulate that there should be no less than 3,000 plants per mu of cotton on dry land and no less than 6,000 plants per mu of cotton on irrigated land. The main reason for achieving abundant yields by implementing dense cotton planting in the Soviet Union is the strict implementation of pasture rotation. Normal cotton cultivation is repeated for three years, and at most no more than five years. According to my observation, the planting density in this area (Handan) should be at least 3,000 to 3,500 plants per mu on dry land, which can be affirmed. However, it needs to be experimented with before it can be promoted. Shortening the plant spacing and moving towards rational dense planting is correct, judging from the Soviet experience and the results of experiments in China. The best preceding crop for cotton is pasture or fallow land. If the land is not used rationally and fully in cultivation, high yields will not be obtained; at the same time, it must also be closely combined with water, fertilizer, and other technical conditions. Dense planting is an important issue in high yields, and each region should determine it through experiments based on specific conditions.

II. Optimal Sowing Period: Sowing is closely related to yield, and sowing a little earlier or later will have a great impact on high yields. In Central Asia, the optimal sowing period is late April. If sowing is done in early May, the yield will be reduced by 25 percent, and if sowing is done in mid-May, the yield will be reduced by 80 percent, or even completely lost.

The Soviet Union determines the sowing period based on soil temperature. When the average temperature at a soil depth of 5 centimeters (1.5 *shi* inches) is 12 degrees Celsius, it is the optimal sowing period. Therefore, places between 43 and 47 degrees north latitude mostly sow in late April. The Chinese proverb "Plant cotton when jujube buds sprout" is not very scientific, because jujube buds grow according to the temperature of the climate, while cotton planting needs to be determined according to the soil temperature. It is hoped that farms in various regions will conduct extensive experiments in order to correctly determine the sowing period in different regions.

III. Cultivation: Autumn plowing is scientific, and it has a great effect on preserving moisture, eliminating insects, and increasing production. The autumn plowing here (Handan) is consistent with the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the depth of autumn plowing is generally 20 to 22 centimeters (6 to 7 inches). The depth of autumn plowing is closely related to the amount of harvest:

The above table proves that the deeper the plowing, the greater the harvest. The farm tools here (Handan) are not good enough and hinder deep plowing, so they should be improved. At the same time, early plowing should be particularly promoted.

Should you harrow after autumn plowing? This depends on the conditions in each region. In the Soviet Union, there is little snow in the southern regions, so in order to accumulate snow, harrowing is not done; there is a lot of snow in the northern regions, so there is no worry about moisture, so harrowing is done. Generally, dry land cotton fields should be harrowed in a timely manner after the spring thaw, and then cultivated once to three times with a cultivator, using a method of crisscrossing without turning the soil. The last cultivation should be carried out one day before sowing, and the depth should be the same as the sowing depth (generally around 4 centimeters).

IV. Irrigation: Cotton field irrigation in the Soviet Union is divided into three periods: pre-winter irrigation, pre-sowing irrigation, and growing season irrigation.

(I) Pre-winter Irrigation: Mostly implemented in alkaline land in order to wash away the alkali and increase moisture. Soil with high alkalinity can be irrigated two or three times; soil with low alkalinity can be irrigated once. Generally, 2,000 to 2,500 cubic meters of water per hectare (15 mu) are used (equivalent to 264,000 *jin* per mu); if you don't wash the alkali, you can use less water.

(II) Pre-sowing Irrigation: Implemented in mid-February to provide moisture to the soil for sowing. The amount of water does not need to be too much, a small amount is sufficient.

(III) Growing Season Irrigation: During the cotton growing season, irrigation is carried out according to the different rainfall and rainy seasons in different regions, generally in three stages: the first stage is when the buds are forming and flowering, water two or three times; the second stage is when the bolls are forming, water three times; the third stage is when the bolls are opening, water once if there is a drought (it is not necessary to water if it is not too dry at this time).

Generally, cotton fields do not implement pre-winter irrigation, only pre-sowing irrigation and growing season irrigation are carried out. The annual irrigation water consumption per hectare (15 mu) is 5,000 cubic meters in areas with an annual rainfall of 200 millimeters. In general areas, it is best to water once in February (suitable for the Handan area), and during the growing season, use small amounts of water and irrigate frequently.

V. Seeds: In the Soviet Union, cotton seeds are selected from the cotton harvested in the first and second rounds, because the germination rate and growth force of the seeds harvested in the Soviet region twice are strong, which can be early-maturing and reduce the phenomenon of missing seedlings. Early-maturing varieties can also be selected from the cotton harvested in the third round, but they must be well-matured. Cotton used for seed should be harvested, ginned, and stored separately to prevent mixing.

In the Soviet Union, seeds are completely handled by ginneries. The method is: first remove the fuzz with sulfuric acid, then mix the seeds with formalin, and then distribute them to the collective farms.

VI. Pruning: Pruning is also very important, and if done well, the yield can be increased by 37.5 to 38 *jin* per mu. Farmers here (Handan area) already have the habit of pruning, but they do it inconsistently and need to improve it.

Academician Lysenko of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published a paper in 1943 and determined the pruning method: first remove the two lower leaf branches, then remove the axillary buds, and finally sequentially remove the top. For dry land cotton plants, topping is generally carried out when the cotton plant has formed seven or eight fruit branches; if the climate, rainfall and other conditions are particularly good, it is also allowed to form nine fruit branches; if the climate, rainfall and other conditions are not good, cotton plants with less than five growing fruit branches do not need to be pruned. Topping of irrigated cotton plants is carried out when the cotton plant has grown into twelve to fourteen fruit branches.

Topping should be done in a timely manner, and not wait until the cotton plant is grown up; at the same time, it should be careful and cautious. Late topping will cause the nutrients of the lower fruit branches of the cotton to be absorbed by the top tip, affecting the quality and harvest. However, it is equally impossible to only top and not pay attention to the management of the side branches. The farmers here (Handan area) generally top the cotton later.

VII. Fertilizer: The Soviet Union also has soybean cakes, but soybean cakes are mostly used as feed and rarely used as fertilizer. Therefore, I don’t have much experience in applying soybean cake fertilizer, so I won’t talk about it. I will use the example of fertilization in Azerbaijan to talk about it. Azerbaijan and this area (Handan area) have similar soil types. Using 24 *jin* of nitrogen, 31 *jin* of phosphorus, and 12.5 *jin* of potassium per mu can meet the needs of 500 *jin* of Egyptian cotton or 520 to 600 *jin* of American cotton. What kind of fertilizer to increase or decrease must be determined based on the soil. If it is alkaline land, 2,600 *jin* of manure should be added; sandy land should add 2,000 *jin* of manure; black land has more humus, and it is sufficient to add 1,200 *jin* of manure. The Soviet manure is a mixture of cow and horse manure and weed fermentation. The Soviet fertilizers contain a certain amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. No matter what kind of land, manure must be turned into the soil during autumn plowing. The date of fertilization should be determined in accordance with the growth period of the cotton plant and the amount of the three elements of fertilizer.

The fertilization period and quantity per mu of the collective farms in the Azerbaijan Republic are as follows:

The fertilizer applied before sowing should be turned into the soil during the last cultivation; fertilizers applied at other times are all applied to the soil 18 to 20 centimeters (6 inches) deep using a cultivator strip application method.

VIII. Management: In the Soviet Union, cultivation is deeper each time, and finally deepens to 8 to 12 centimeters. It can be affirmed that this is good for cotton and will never cause the phenomenon of flower and bud drop. If there is a hard skin on the ground, the air cannot circulate. This is like waxing a person's body, which will affect growth. Therefore, cotton should be cultivated more and deeply cultivated. It is not appropriate to wait until 20 days after emergence before weeding. The more the number of cultivations, the better, generally eight or nine times in the Soviet Union.

The yield of cotton per mu on Azerbaijan farms: 157 *jin* in 1934, 268 *jin* in 1935, 400 *jin* in 1936, 410 *jin* in 1937, and 518 *jin* in 1938, because the cultivation management technology was improved year by year. In 1939, a general call was made to use reasonable management techniques, and in the same year, 1,800 collective farms achieved an average yield of 1,250 *jin* per mu on 2.16 million mu of land.

IX. Pest Control: In the Soviet Union, the main thing is to actively grasp the principle of "prevention is better than cure." The methods of prevention are mainly autumn plowing, weeding, seed soaking, etc. All collective farms have sufficient medicines and machinery, and immediately and thoroughly eliminate and treat pests as soon as they occur.

In short, in the future, each farm should comprehensively study a set of technologies to guide farmers, which will play a decisive role in high yields. (Attached charts)

    卢森科谈苏联棉花丰产经验
    编者按：去年十月间，中央人民政府农业部顾问、苏联农业专家卢森科同志，曾赴河北石家庄专区及邯郸专区，指导棉花丰产工作。他先后参观了河北省的农场和专区农场及劳动模范梁家瑞、张德芳、宋成全等的棉花丰产地，并就地进行指导。他在邯郸专区召开了棉花丰产座谈会，解答了到会者提出的有关棉花丰产的疑难问题，介绍了苏联棉花丰产的先进经验。这篇报告是根据他的谈话整理出来的，曾在五月二十八日河北日报发表，河北日报登载的译文有若干重要的错误和遗漏，本报发表前曾请卢森科同志仔细校阅订正。他说，各地在运用这些经验时，必须根据当地的具体条件，结合农民的丰产经验和农场的试验效果来决定。我们认为这篇报告对我国棉花丰产运动是有重要指导意义的。
    大家提出的问题都很重要，都是和丰产有关系的。但是，如果脱离整个条件，单单地研究一个问题，这是不科学的，是不能得出正确结论的。必须根据整体条件，长时间的试验，才能正确判定。因为我到这里（邯郸）时间很短，所以对这里的棉花耕作情况很难加以判定。现在仅就我知道的苏联棉作方法，向大家介绍一下：
    一、密植问题：植棉的密度，因各地自然情况不同，不能随便加以判定。苏联棉花密植是根据科学和群众长时期经验结合制定的。我举乌克兰黑尔逊棉场的试验结果来说明：
    （一）旱地（沙质黏土壤，即上层为“砂质壤土”，下层为“黏土”，群众叫做“蒙金土”）棉花密度试验结果：
    （二）灌溉地（沙质黏土壤）棉花密度试验结果：
    （以上是在一般环境中自然生育的结果，没有肥料和技术加工。）
    由上列表中可以看到，株数和产量的关系很密切。所以我们苏联规定旱地每亩棉花不少于三千株，水地每亩棉花最少六千株。在苏联实行棉花密植能获得丰富产量，主要是在栽培上严格地执行了牧草轮作制。正常棉作重茬三年，最多也不超过五年。这个地区（邯郸）植棉密度，据我观察，旱地最少应在三千株到三千五百株，可以肯定。但是需要进行试验后再作推广。缩短株距，走向合理的密植，从苏联的经验和在中国试验的结果来看，是正确的。棉花的前作物最好是牧草地或休闲地。在栽培上如不能合理而充分地使用土地，就不会得到丰产；同时，也必须和水、肥料及其它技术等条件密切结合。密植是丰产中的一个重要问题，各地应根据具体情况，通过试验来确定。
    二、播种适期问题：播种和产量有重要关系，播种稍早稍晚，对丰产影响很大。在中亚细亚，四月下旬为播种适期，如果在五月上旬播种，就会减产百分之二十五，五月中旬播种就会减产百分之八十，甚至完全不收。
    苏联根据地温确定播种期。在土深五公分（即一点五市寸），平均温度摄氏十二度时，为播种适期。所以北纬四十三度到四十七度的地方，多在四月下旬播种。中国“枣芽发种棉花”的农谚是不大合乎科学的，因为枣芽是跟随气候的温度生长，而种棉却需要根据土壤温度确定。希望各地农场广泛进行试验，以便正确确定不同地区的播种期。
    三、耕作问题：秋耕是合乎科学的，它对保墒、灭虫、增产作用很大。这里（邯郸）的秋耕是和苏联一致的。在苏联秋耕深度一般在二十到二十二公分（六、七寸）。秋耕深度和收获量有很大关系：
    上表可以证明：耕得越深，收获量越大。这里的（邯郸）农具还不够好，妨碍深耕，应加以改造。同时应该特别提倡早耕。
    秋耕后耙不耙呢？这要根据各地区情况而定。在苏联，南部地区雪少，为了积雪，便不耙；北部地区雪多，不愁水分，便耙。一般旱地棉田，春季解冻后，应及时早耙，然后再用中耕器进行一次到三次中耕，方法是纵横交叉不翻土。最后一次中耕，要在播种前一天进行，深度要与播种深度同（即一般在四公分上下）。
    四、灌溉问题：棉田灌溉在苏联分为三期，一是冬前灌溉，一是播种前灌溉，一是生长期灌溉。
    （一）冬前灌溉：多是在硷地实行，以便洗硷和增加水分。硷性大的土壤，可灌溉两、三次；硷性小的土壤，可灌溉一次。每公顷（十五亩）一般用水两千到两千五百立方公尺（合每亩二十六万四千斤）；如果不冼硷可少用水。
    （二）播种前灌溉：在二月中旬实行，意在供给土地水分，以便播种。水量不必过多，少量即可。
    （三）生长期灌溉：在棉花生长期，根据各地不同的降雨量和降雨期，实行灌溉，一般分三期进行：第一期在结蕾开花时，浇水两、三次；第二期在结桃时，浇水三次；第三期在开桃时，如遇天旱，也可浇水一次（这时不太旱就不必浇）。
    一般棉田不实行冬前灌溉，只进行播种期灌溉与生长期灌溉。每公顷（十五亩）全年灌溉用水量，在年降雨量二百公厘的地区，给水五千立方公尺。一般地区，二月里最好浇水一次（邯郸地区适宜），生长期应用小水勤浇。
    五、种籽问题：在苏联，棉花种籽是从第一、第二两次所采收的棉花中选出的，因为在苏联区两次所采的棉籽发芽率和生长力都强，可以早熟，并能减少缺苗现象。早熟种也可由第三次所采收的棉花中选取，但是必须是成熟得好的。选做种籽用的棉花，应该分收、分轧、分存，防止混杂。
    在苏联，种籽完全是由轧花厂处理的。方法是：先用硫酸去底毛，再用弗尔马林拌种，然后发到集体农庄。
    六、整枝问题：整枝问题也很重要，如果做得好，每亩可增产三十七斤半到三十八斤。这里（邯郸区）农民已有整枝习惯，但是做得很不一致，须加改进。
    苏联科学院院士李森科在一九四三年发表论文，确定了整枝法：先去下部两个叶枝，再去腋芽，最后顺序去顶。旱地棉株去顶，一般是在棉株形成七、八个果枝时进行；若在气候、雨水等条件特好的年头，也允许形成九个果枝时进行；若在气候、雨水等条件不好的年头，生长的果枝数目在五个以下的棉棵，不必进行整枝。水地棉株去顶，是在棉株长成十二个到十四个果枝时进行。
    整枝去顶要抓紧时机，不要等棉株长大以后再进行；同时还要仔细谨慎。去顶晚，会使棉花下部果枝上的养分被顶尖吸去，影响品质和收成。但是只去顶而不注意旁枝的管理，也同样不行。这里（邯郸区）的农民一般去棉顶较晚。
    七、肥料问题：苏联也有豆饼，但多用豆饼做饲料，用做肥料的很少。所以我对施豆饼肥料的经验不多，也就不谈了。我举阿塞拜疆的施肥例子来谈谈。阿塞拜疆和这个地区（邯郸区）的土质相似，每亩用氮二十四斤、磷三十一斤、钾十二斤半，可满足埃及棉五百斤或美棉五百二十斤到六百斤的需要。增减何种肥料，须根据土壤来决定。如果是硷地，须加用厩肥二千六百斤；沙质地须加厩肥二千斤；黑土地因腐植质多，加用厩肥一千二百斤即可。苏联的厩肥是牛马粪和杂草的混合发酵物。苏联的肥料中含氮、磷、钾是有一定的。不管什么土地，加用厩肥都须在秋耕时翻入土内。施肥日期应配合棉株生长期和肥料三要素的多少而决定。
    阿塞拜疆共和国集体农庄施肥期及每亩数量如下：
    播种前施的肥料，要在最后一次中耕时翻下土去；其他时间施肥，都是用中耕器条施法施入十八到二十公分（六寸）深的土里。
    八、管理问题：在苏联，中耕是一次比一次加深的，最后加深到八至十二公分。可以肯定，这对棉花是有好处的，绝不会因此造成落花落蕾现象。地面有了硬皮，空气不能流通。这就和人身上抹了蜡一样，要影响生长。所以，对棉花应多中耕、深中耕。有的等出苗二十天后才锄是不恰当的。中耕次数越多越好，在苏联一般是八、九次。
    阿塞拜疆农场每亩棉花的收成：一九三四年是一百五十七斤，一九三五年是二百六十八斤，一九三六年是四百斤，一九三七年是四百一十斤，一九三八年是五百一十八斤，便是因为逐年提高了耕作管理技术。一九三九年普遍号召使用合理的管理技术，当年便有一千八百个集体农庄，在二百一十六万亩的土地上，得到了每亩平均丰产一千二百五十斤的成绩。
    九、防治虫害问题：在苏联，主要是主动地掌握“防重于治”的方针。防的方法主要是秋耕、铲除杂草、浸拌种籽等。各集体农庄都准备有足够的药械，稍见虫害发生，就立即彻底除治。
    总之，今后各农场应全面地研究一套技术来指导农民，这对丰产会起决定的作用。（附图表）
