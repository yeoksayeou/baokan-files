New Records on the Production Front

    Wang Mingshan's team from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Drilling Team Sets New Record of 28 Meters Drilled
    Having created a new record of drilling 23 meters of sandstone and shale per day, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Drilling Engineering Team immediately launched a fervent study after seeing the advanced drilling experience of Ma Wenzhi's group published in the People's Daily. All workers in Wang Mingshan's team realized that breaking conservative thinking and accelerating the drilling rig's speed were key to improving drilling efficiency. They changed the electric motor's pulley from six inches to six and a half inches and strived to increase the drilling rig's speed at any time based on geological conditions and drilling depth, which greatly improved drilling efficiency. Wang Mingshan's team also improved labor organization and the method of welding drill bits. During operation, they grasped the different hardness of the rock layers, increased or decreased pressure accordingly, allowing the drill bits to drill smoothly. They also created a new record of drilling 28.02 meters per day in yellow sandstone and shale. From May 13th to 23rd, they averaged 19.2 meters drilled per day over the ten-day period. (Jiao Gong)

    Wang Wensheng and Others from Jinzhou Textile Factory Weaving Workshop Set New Record for Warping Efficiency
    Wang Wensheng and three other warping workers from the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Northeast China created a mutual assistance warping method, increasing warping efficiency by 66%. In the past, each warping required a 30-minute stoppage. The mutual assistance warping method created by Wang Wensheng and others, based on preliminary measurements, only requires a 9-minute and 30-second stoppage for each warping, shortening the Northeast's highest warping record by 10 minutes. According to preliminary calculations, implementing this method can increase national production by an amount equal to 342.72 tons of grain per year. Leading cadres of the Jinzhou Textile Factory are summarizing this work method and preparing to promote it.

    Xizhimen Station Sets National Record for Loading Volume
    The freight transport team at the Xizhimen Station of the Beijing Railway Bureau conscientiously studied the Yang Maolin loading method and adopted Yang Maolin's "Planned Transportation Method for Less-than-Carload (LCL) Cargo." On May 29th, when transporting packed LCL cargo, they loaded 42.3 tons of goods into each car, creating the highest national record for loading volume. (Ma Rongbao)

    Molding Workshop of Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory Has No Scalding Accidents for 150 Days
    The molding workshop of the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory has established a new record of 150 days without scalding accidents from last December until now. Scalding is the most serious and common accident in the molding workshop, occurring at least five or six times per month in the past. After October last year, the factory's leading cadres emphasized safe production and educated employees about it. Subsequently, all the workshop's employees, led by the labor model Liu Tonggao's group, made sure to wear leggings, sleeves, and foot covers and wear glasses to protect their bodies during work. At the same time, they improved the safe production system. In this way, scalding accidents were avoided, and both output and quality were significantly improved. (Xu Yanpei)

    生产战线上的新纪录
    焦作煤矿钻探工程队王明善班创钻进二十八公尺新纪录
    创造了每日钻探砂页岩二十三公尺新纪录的焦作矿务局钻探工程队，看到了人民日报刊登的马文志小组的先进钻探经验后，立即热烈地展开学习。王明善班全体工人认识到打破保守思想，加快钻机转数，是提高钻探效率的关键。他们把电动机的皮带轮由六寸改为六寸半，根据地质情况和钻进深度，随时争取加快钻机转数，这就大大地提高了钻探效率。王明善班同时改进了劳动组织和焊钻头的办法，在操作中掌握了岩层软硬不同的情况，增加或减少压力，使钻头得以顺利钻进。他们又创造了钻黄砂岩和页岩日进二十八点零二公尺的新纪录，五月十三日到二十三日十日中，平均每日钻进十九点二公尺。　（焦工）
    锦州纺织厂织布车间王文生等创上轴效率的新纪录
    东北锦州纺织厂织布车间上轴工人王文生等四人，创造了互助上轴法，提高上轴效率百分之六十六。过去，上一次轴需停车三十分钟。王文生等创造的互助上轴法，经初步测定，上一次轴只需停车九分三十秒钟，比东北上轴的最高纪录缩短了十分钟。经初步计算，施行这种方法，一年可给国家增产等于三百四十二点七二吨粮食的财富。锦州纺织厂领导干部正在总结这个工作法，并准备推广。

    西直门车站创全国装载量的最高纪录
    北京铁路分局西直门车站货运小组认真学习杨茂林装车法，采用杨茂林的“零担货物计划运送办法”，在五月二十九日装运整装零担车时，在每辆车内装了四十二点三吨货物，创造了全国装载量的最高的纪录。　（马荣宝）
    青岛纺织机械厂模铸车间一百五十天没有发生烫伤事故
    国营青岛纺织机械厂模铸车间，从去年十二月到现在，创一百五十天无烫伤事故的新纪录。烫伤是模铸车间最严重而普遍的事故，过去每月最少要发生五、六次。去年十月份以后，该厂领导干部重视了安全生产，对职工进行了安全生产教育。接着，全车间职工在劳动模范刘同诰小组带头下，做到了在工作时一定穿套裤、套袖、脚罩，并戴眼镜，以保护身体安全。同时又健全了安全生产制度。这样，就避免了烫伤事故，使产量质量都显著提高。    （徐延培）
