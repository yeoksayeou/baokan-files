    Xinhua News Agency, June 16th: Paris dispatch - Despite the fact that French officials have long admitted that the myth of the so-called "Toulon Communist Plot" that they fabricated has gone bankrupt, they have not given up their conspiracy to accuse the French Communist Party of engaging in espionage. In recent days, the French judicial and police authorities have been intensifying their fascist-style searches and arrests in various places, in an effort to create "evidence" for this slanderous conspiracy.
    On the 13th and 14th, the French police conducted another search at the French naval base of Toulon, and arrested Luxano, the president of the democratic newspaper "Var Small Newspaper," and Arexis, the secretary of the Toulon dockworkers' union, and imprisoned them in Saint-Roch prison; Poudal, the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Morillon, near Toulon, was also illegally arrested. At present, twelve people have been arrested in connection with the so-called "Toulon incident." At the same time, the police and secret agents of the Seine Province also "raided" the offices of local French Communist Party organizations and trade unions near Paris.
    The current rampant and shamelessness of the French police authorities is fully demonstrated by the following fact: on the 12th, the police even took a warrant from the Vichy police authorities in 1944 and arrested Latigue, the head of the French public health workers' delegation who was about to visit a certain people's democratic country, and the secretary of the French Public Health Workers Association, at Bourget Airport in Paris. The arrest warrant stated that Latigue was to be arrested because he had escaped from a Nazi concentration camp.
    Bartolini, a Communist member of the National Assembly for the Var region, revealed in the National Assembly that the so-called "Communist conspiracy to endanger national defense" case was completely fabricated by the Toulon police authorities. Bartolini said: The main evidence of the so-called Communist "espionage" at the Brusque Naval Research Center was said to be the secret documents found from engineer Daire, who had already been arrested in Toulon. In fact, this document was nothing more than the minutes of the meeting of the joint trade union committee of this naval research center. This record of meeting was distributed by the Undersecretary of the Navy of the French Ministry of National Defense to all trade union organizations such as the French General Confederation of Labor, the right-wing Socialist Party's "Workers' Force," and the Catholic Labor League.

    土伦警察局捏造罪名阴谋破产后
    比内政府继续阴谋诬陷法共
    【新华社十六日讯】巴黎消息，尽管法国官方早已承认他们所捏造的所谓“土伦共产党阴谋”的神话已经破产，但是他们仍然没有放弃诬告法国共产党从事间谍活动的阴谋。最近几天以来，法国司法当局和警察当局正在各地加紧进行法西斯式的搜查和逮捕，竭力为这种诬陷阴谋制造“证据”。
    十三日和十四日，法国警察又在法国海军基地土伦港进行了搜查，并且逮捕了民主报纸“瓦尔省小报”社长吕霞诺和土伦码头工人工会书记阿雷希斯，把他们关在圣罗克监狱里；土伦附近摩利荣地方的共产党支部书记蒲达来尔，也遭到了非法逮捕。目前因为所谓“土伦事件”而被捕的，已经有十二人。同时，塞纳省的警察和特务也“突袭”了巴黎附近法国共产党地方组织和工会的办公处。
    法国警察当局目前的猖狂与无耻充分表现在下面的事实上：十二日，警察竟拿着一九四四年维希警察当局的拘票，在巴黎布尔日机场逮捕了正拟前往访问某人民民主国家的法国公共卫生工作者代表团团长，法国公共卫生工作者协会秘书拉蒂格。这张拘捕证上写着：所以要拘捕拉蒂格，是因为他逃出了纳粹集中营。
    法国国民议会瓦尔省的议员、共产党人巴多利尼在国民议会中发言时，揭露了所谓“共产党阴谋危害国防”一案完全是土伦警察当局的捏造。巴多利尼说：所谓共产党在海军研究中心布鲁斯克进行“间谍活动”的主要证据，据说是从已经在土伦被捕的工程师戴莱那里搜得的机密文件。其实这种文件不过是这个海军研究中心的联合工会委员会的会议记录罢了。这种会议记录，是由法国国防部海军次长分发给法国总工会、右翼社会党的“工人力量”和天主教劳工联盟等一切工会组织的。
