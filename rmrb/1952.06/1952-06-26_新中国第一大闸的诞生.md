More than two months ago, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project, stipulating that the intake gate project must be completed before the flood season of the Yangtze River. On June 18th, people received such an exciting victory message: the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Area Intake Gate, the first great dam in China, spanning 1,054 meters and including 54 openings, was completed twelve days ahead of schedule.

The intake gate is located at Taipingkou (i.e., the mouth of the Hudu River) on the south bank of the Jingjiang River. Upstream of the gate is the section of the Yangtze River's Three Gorges, known for its flow rate of three meters per second. Downstream of the gate, on both banks of the Jingjiang River, are the fertile Jianghan Plain and the shores of Dongting Lake. For many years, every time the Yangtze River flood season arrived, the floods of the Three Gorges rushed down, causing the water level of the narrow and shoal-filled Jingjiang River to rise above the land on both banks. To divert the floods of the Jingjiang River to ensure the safety of millions of people on both banks and the abundant harvests of billions of jin of rice, cotton, and miscellaneous grains has been the wish of the people on both banks of the Jingjiang River for generations. However, in the hundreds of years before the founding of New China, people had been powerless in this regard. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, after the flood broke the Jingjiang levee on the north bank, the feudal dynasty used a clumsy and ridiculous iron ox in Taipingkou to "suppress" the river flood. When the flood in 1945 flooded the fertile fields on the south bank of the Jingjiang River, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers had no other way but to rely on the natural flood diversion of the four mouths (Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian) in Jiangnan, which were silted up and could not function effectively. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government could the people's wishes be realized, the Jingjiang levee on the north bank of the Jingjiang River be strengthened, and modern water conservancy projects be built on the south bank of the Jingjiang River to control the floods.

It is not difficult to imagine how difficult it would be for us today to build a modern intake gate weighing 440,000 tons on flat sandy soil, without driving piles, and to ensure the safe storage of floodwater under the impact of a flow rate of more than 8,000 cubic meters per second. Many technical problems in the project exceeded the experience of the most skilled technicians from large cities such as Shanghai and Wuhan. These technicians had built many tall buildings, but they were very unfamiliar and difficult to tie the reinforcing bars for the gate piers of the intake gate and erect the formwork of the gate piers. In the meantime, the accuracy to ensure safety is usually calculated in millimeters. As for the construction of scour prevention equipment, seepage filter layers, leak-proof equipment, installation of purple copper sheets and oil felt, etc., they had not only never done it, but also never seen it. However, under the call of their leader Chairman Mao, the heroic Chinese workers demonstrated unparalleled perseverance, patriotism, diligence, and wisdom in the construction. They learned while doing and worked with the project technicians to study while doing, and finally successfully completed the glorious task entrusted to them by the motherland and the people.

When all the gate piers were built, and the fifty-four deep gray arc-shaped gate leaves were comfortably installed between the gate piers, the reporter met a worker who installed the formwork of the gate piers. He had worked hard on the construction of these gate piers and was now extremely happy. He is only nineteen years old this year. From his conversation, I realized the amazing and strong sense of responsibility of the workers of New China. He said: "When I first installed the formwork of the gate piers, I felt a little flustered. The position of each gate pier could not be more than three millimeters different, and the yoke (used to fix the formwork) of the formwork of the gate pier, which was round in the front and square in the back, was very difficult to make, and there was no way to drive supporting piles on the concrete base plate of the gate base to fix the formwork. It was really difficult. But I thought: if it wasn't difficult, it wouldn't be called the first great dam of New China. Since Chairman Mao entrusted this task to us this time, we must do it well no matter what. In addition, the migrant workers in the workshop (farmers from both banks of the Jingjiang River) often cared and asked me: 'How is the dam doing!' This made me feel even more that things could not be joked about and must be done safely. For this reason, I don't know how many drawings I have studied with the engineers and how many tests I have done. Sometimes, in order to finish the work, I didn't feel tired even if I didn't sleep for three days and three nights. As a result, people are still ruthless, the yoke is also firmly made, and the supporting piles have also found a place to insert, rooted in the screws on the base plate. Now you see, which gate pier is not made quite accurately!"

The concrete work of this gate totaled more than 84,000 cubic meters, and the number of rivets on the fifty-four gate leaves was as high as more than 320,000. To complete such a huge building in more than two months, even if all the time was sunny, would be an extremely tense job. However, the construction period was during the rainy season in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The workers' clothes were often soaked and then dried by body temperature, and then soaked again. When pouring the base plate of the gate base and the upstream and downstream riprap, spring water kept gushing out from under the sandy soil. After the base was dug, before the formwork could be erected, the quicksand would silt up again. In order to gain time to complete the task, the workers were still able to continuously create new records of work efficiency under these difficult circumstances. They often began to find techniques to complete the task ahead of schedule as soon as they accepted the task of when to complete what work. Many miracles have appeared in this process. In the past, the line positioning work mostly used calipers for measurement, but this time He Yuju, a fitter from Jianghan Shipbuilding Company, broke the convention. He considered that if he did it like before, he could only measure one opening a day. By the time the fifty-four openings were measured, the flood would be about to overflow the banks. If the efficiency was not increased three times than before, the task would not be completed. Subsequently, he really came up with a solution, increasing the line positioning work from eight hours to measure one opening to two and a half hours to measure one opening, thus ensuring the completion of the construction plan.

The close organization and the interlocking and interconnected nature of the various construction works, which played a role in mutual promotion, was also an important factor in the early completion of this huge gate. During the most tense period of construction, more than 80,000 people worked together, and more than 100 machines roared day and night. On a construction site of about 100,000 square meters, various tasks progressed simultaneously, which was a great labor march. This caused the huge concrete work to rise from pouring 800 cubic meters per day to more than 2,000 cubic meters, and the highest reached more than 4,000 cubic meters per day. This is an unprecedented record in the history of construction in our country.

"Everything is for building the first great dam well!" "Everything is for the broad masses of the people!" Although the people who participated in this project came from all directions and all walks of life, they demonstrated a high degree of unity and mutual assistance in the common will to complete the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project on schedule, and everyone supported and helped each other to overcome difficulties. When the workers of Jianghan Shipbuilding Company completed their tasks ahead of schedule, they immediately took the initiative to supply the pneumatic riveting guns to the workers of Jiang'an Bridge Factory, and went to help the workers of Jiang'an Bridge Factory install the gate leaves despite their fatigue. A marine worker said:

"The sooner the task is completed, the sooner we can feel at ease. What's the difference between yours and mine? We are building our own country anyway!"

Now, the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Area Intake Gate, as the first great dam in our country, has been born. A magnificent modern building has stood on the south bank of the Yangtze River. If a large flood occurs in the Jingjiang River and must be diverted into the flood diversion area, it will open its mouth wide and absorb one-fifth of the Jingjiang River flood at a rate of 8,000 cubic meters per second, ensuring the safety of the prosperous rural areas on both banks of the Jingjiang River.

    新中国第一大闸的诞生
    新华社记者    姚昌淦
    两个多月以前，中央人民政府政务院发布关于荆江分洪工程的决定，规定进洪闸工程要在长江汛期以前保证完成。六月十八日这一天，人们得到了这样一个令人兴奋的胜利消息：长达一千零五十四公尺、包括五十四孔的中国第一大闸—荆江分洪区进洪闸，较规定期限提前十二天完成了。
    进洪闸位于荆江南岸太平口（即虎渡河口）。闸的上游，是以每秒三公尺流速著称的长江三峡段，闸以下的荆江两岸，是田野肥美的江汉平原和洞庭湖滨。多少年来，每逢长江汛期，三峡的洪水奔腾直下，使弯狭多滩的荆江水位高出两岸的地面。分泄荆江的洪水以保障两岸千百万人民的安全和数十亿斤稻谷、棉花和杂粮的丰收，是荆江两岸人民多少世世代代以来的愿望。可是在新中国成立以前的数百年中，人们在这方面却一直无能为力。满清乾隆年间，洪水冲溃北岸的荆江大堤后，封建王朝在太平口用以“镇压”江洪的是一只笨重可笑的铁牛。一九四五年洪水泛滥荆江南岸千里沃野的时候，国民党反动统治者除依赖淤塞得不大能起作用的江南四口（松滋、太平、藕池、调弦）自然分洪外，别无办法。只有在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，人们的愿望才实现了，才在荆江北岸加强了荆江大堤，又在荆江南岸修建了现代化的水利工程来控制洪水。
    人们不难想像：把一座四十四万吨重的现代化进洪闸摆在平地沙土上，不打基桩，而又要在每秒八千多立方公尺流量冲击下保证安全吞蓄洪水，这对于我们今天的技术条件来讲，是一件多么困难的事。工程中的许多技术问题，都超过了来自上海、武汉等大城市的最熟练的技术工人的经验。这些技术工人修建过许多高楼大厦，但他们架扎进洪闸门墩的钢筋和树立闸墩模型板时却十分生疏、棘手。这中间，保证安全的精确度通常又是以公厘计算的。至于防冲设备、滤渗层的铺筑、防漏设备、紫铜片和油毛毡的装置等等，他们不但从未做过，也从未见过。但是，英勇的中国工人们在自己的领袖毛主席的召唤下，施工中发扬了无比坚毅的爱国主义精神、勤劳和智慧。他们边学边做，和工程技术人员一面研究一面做，终于顺利地完成了祖国和人民交给他们的光荣任务。
    当闸墩全部筑成，而且五十四扇深灰色的弧形闸门已舒适地安在闸墩之间的时候，记者会见了一个安装闸墩模型板的工人。他曾为这些闸墩施工煞费苦心，而现在高兴极了。他今年只有十九岁。我从他的谈话中，认识了新中国工人的惊人强烈的责任感。他说：“当我刚安装闸墩模型板的时候，心里真有点慌。每个闸墩的位置不能差三个公厘，而前圆后方的闸墩模型板的轭头（用以固定模型板的箍）又很难做好，闸基混凝土底板上又无法打撑桩来固定模型板，真是困难极了。可是我想：如果不困难，那就不叫新中国的第一大闸了。毛主席这回既放心把这个任务交给我们，那我们无论怎样也要做好。加之工场上的民工们（来自荆江两岸的农民）经常关心的问我：‘闸做得怎么样啦！’这越发使我感到事情是开不得玩笑的，一定要保险做好。为了这，我不知道和工程师研究过多少图样，作过多少试验。有时为了赶完工作，三天三夜不睡觉也不觉得累。结果还是人狠，轭头也做牢实了，撑桩也找到了插的地方，插在底板的螺丝上生根了。现在你看看，那一个闸墩不是做得挺准确的！”
    这个闸的混凝土工共八万四千多公方，五十四扇闸门上的铆钉多至三十二万多颗。这样一个庞大的建筑物，要在两个多月内修成，即使全部时间都是晴天，也是个极其紧张的工作。施工期间却正当长江中游雨季，工人们的衣服经常是淋透了又被体温烙干，烙干了又被淋透。浇灌闸基底板和上、下游海漫时，沙土底下泉水不断涌出，底基挖好了，不等模型板立起，流沙就又淤拢来了。为着争取时间完成任务，工人们在这种艰难的情况下，仍能不断地创造着各种工作效率的新纪录。他们往往一接受什么时候要完成什么工作的任务的时候，心里就已盘算着找寻提前完成任务的技巧。这中间出现了许多奇迹。吊线定位工作以前多用卡钳测量，这次江汉船舶公司的钳工贺毓菊打破了成规。他考虑到：如果还像以前那样干，一天只能测定一孔，等五十四孔测定完了，洪水也就快要漫堤了。如不把效率比以前提高三倍就完不成任务。随后，他真的想出了办法，使吊线工作由八小时测定一孔提高到两小时半测定一孔，因而保证了施工计划的完成。
    经过细密的组织，建闸的各项工作交叉而又衔接起来，起相互推动的作用，也是这个巨闸能够提前建成的重要因素。施工最紧张的时候，八万多人一齐出马，一百多部机器日夜轰鸣，大约十万平方公尺的工地上，各项工作齐头并进，是一场伟大的劳动进军。这使庞大的混凝土工从每天浇灌八百方上升到二千多方，最高达到每天浇灌四千多方。这是在我国建筑史上空前未有的纪录。
        “一切为了修好第一大闸！”“一切为了广大人民！”虽然参加这次工程的人们来自四面八方、各行各业，但在按期完成荆江分洪工程这个共同意志上，人们发挥了高度的团结互助的精神，大家互相支援，互相帮助，克服了困难。当江汉船舶公司的工人们提前完成任务的时候，他们立刻主动地把风铆枪供给了江岸桥梁厂的工人，而且不顾疲乏去帮助江岸桥梁厂的工人安装闸门。一位海员工人说：
    “早一天完成任务早安心，还分什么你的我的，横直是建设自己的国家！”
    现在，作为我国第一大闸的荆江分洪区进洪闸已经诞生了。一座雄伟的现代化建筑物已经屹立在长江南岸。如果荆江发生过大洪水必须分洪入分洪区时，它将张开大口，以每秒八千立方公尺流量的速率，吞吸荆江五分之一的洪水，保障荆江两岸的富庶的农村的安全。
