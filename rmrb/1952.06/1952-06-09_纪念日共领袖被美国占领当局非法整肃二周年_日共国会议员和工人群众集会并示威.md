Japanese Communist Party Diet members called on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the Yoshida government, a puppet of U.S. imperialism, and establish a people's government friendly to the Soviet Union, China, and other countries. Other speakers accused the United States and the Yoshida government of using Japanese factories to prepare for another war.
