    On Doxey Wilkerson's Imprisonment
    Guo Moruo

    Mr. Doxey Wilkerson and his comrades, leaders of the American Communist Party, a total of seventeen, have been imprisoned by the American government since their arrest on June 20th last year, and it will soon be a year.

    As a Chinese writer, I would like to say a few words about Mr. Wilkerson's imprisonment. However, my words are not directed at the American government and its behind-the-scenes bosses, the American millionaires, hoping that they will automatically abandon their crimes. No, it is not. My words are directed at all rational, clear-minded, and kind-hearted people around the world, hoping that through Wilkerson's experience, they will re-recognize the truth about the American government and its behind-the-scenes bosses.

    Wilkerson is an excellent American critic, a teacher at the "Workers School" and the "Jefferson School of Social Science" in New York. What crime did he commit? Simply because in the midst of mad war clamoring, he opposed the war and made sincere appeals for peace and progress.

    In February 1951, he published an article in "Political Affairs" entitled "Mastering Cultural Weapons." He criticized the current capitalist culture in the United States that promotes racial superiority and clamors for war, believing that it is very harmful to the American people. He argued that the American people, with their fine democratic traditions, should master their own cultural weapons and fight for peace and all other progressive causes.

    It is such an article that constitutes Wilkerson's crime. The American government said that he "issued a directive and spread it through 'Political Affairs'" – "conspiring to incite the overthrow of the American government by force and violence." Therefore, Wilkerson was arrested, imprisoned, and his life in prison is approaching a year.

    To us, this seems a bit ridiculous, making clear-headed people a little unbelievable. However, everything the American government is doing today is exactly like this.

    As for the American government, I would like to give it an appropriate title, which is a madhouse.

    Even outstanding American historical figures such as Jefferson and Lincoln, falling into the hands of today's madmen, would certainly suffer the same fate as Wilkerson.

    It is precisely such a government that was able to drop the only two atomic bombs at that time on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in August 1945, killing 200,000 peaceful Japanese residents.

    It is precisely such a government that has been able to drop countless bacteriological bombs on Korea and China since January this year, attempting to massacre the people of China and Korea on a large scale.

    It is precisely such a government that is able to "speak nice words and do bad things."

    It is precisely such a government that is able to be so paranoid, determining that others are "conspiring to incite the overthrow of" it "by force and violence."

    Although such a government tries its best to "use force and violence" to maintain its existence, can it last forever? Jefferson and Lincoln answered this question clearly long ago.

    关于季洛姆的入狱
    郭沫若
    季洛姆先生和他的同志美国共产党领袖，一共十七位，自去年六月二十日被美国政府逮捕入狱以来，快满一年了。
    我，作为一个中国作家，关于季洛姆先生的入狱，想说几句话。但我的话并不准备以美国政府和它的后台老板美国百万富翁们为对象，希望他们会自动放弃罪行。不，不是的。我的话是准备以全世界理智清明、心境善良的人们为对象，希望他们通过了季洛姆的遭遇，重新认识一遍美国政府和它们后台老板们的真相。
    季洛姆是美国优秀的评论家，是纽约“工人学校”和“杰斐逊社会科学学校”的教师。他犯了什么罪呢？就因为他在疯狂的战争叫嚣当中，反对了战争，为和平与进步作了由衷的呼吁。
    一九五一年二月他在“政治月刊”上发表了一篇文章“掌握文化武器”。他批评了宣传种族优越、叫嚣战争的美国当前的资本主义文化，认为对于美国人民是有很大的毒害的。他主张有优良民主传统的美国人民应该掌握自己的文化武器，为和平及其它一切进步事业而斗争。
    就是这样的一篇文章构成了季洛姆的罪状，美国政府说他“发出一项指令并经由‘政治月刊’传播出去”——“阴谋教唆用武力和暴力来推翻美国政府”。因此，季洛姆被捕了，入狱了，狱中生活且将一年了。
    这在我们看起来，简直有点滑稽，令头脑清醒的人有点不敢相信。然而今天的美国政府所干的一切事情正是这个样子。
    美国政府嘛，我想给它一个适当的称号，那就是一座疯人院。
    就是杰斐逊、林肯那些杰出的美国历史人物，落到今天的疯人们手里，也定会受到和季洛姆同样的遭遇的。
    正是这样的政府，所以才能够在一九四五年八月在日本的广岛和长崎投下了那时仅有的两枚原子弹，杀伤了日本的和平居民二十万人。
    正是这样的政府，所以才能够从今年一月起，在朝鲜和中国投下了无数的细菌弹，企图大量屠杀中朝人民。
    正是这样的政府，所以才能够“把好话说尽，把坏事做完”。
    正是这样的政府，所以才能够那样疑神疑鬼地，断定别人在“阴谋教唆用武力和暴力来推翻”它。
    这样的政府尽管尽可能地“用武力和暴力”来维持自己的存在，它能够长远不坠吗？杰斐逊和林肯早就明确地答复了这个问题了。
