    Improving Labor Organization and Operational Methods
    Jiaozuo Mining Bureau Continuously Sets New Well-Sinking Records

    The Basic Construction Engineering Team of the Beixiaojing Well at the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, during the well-sinking project, adjusted the labor organization, implemented assembly line operations, improved operational methods, and created a new record of sinking 9.6 meters per day, with the quality of the project fully meeting specifications. The Beixiaojing Well at the Lifeng Mine was originally an earthen kiln with a diameter of 1.5 meters, used to supply air to the Nanjin Well. Lifeng Mine is opening up new working faces, and the lifting capacity of the wellhead needs to be urgently increased. The lifting capacity of the Nanjin Well can no longer meet the needs of production. Therefore, the leadership decided to expand the diameter of the Beixiaojing Well to six meters and deepen it by nineteen meters.

    The Beixiaojing Well Engineering Team first improved the labor organization and implemented assembly line operations. In the past, the team's labor organization was very chaotic, with unclear division of labor and unfixed job types. After going down the well, the squad leader and group leader would only temporarily assign work. Therefore, idling was serious, affecting the progress of the project. At that time, although there was a distinction between skilled workers and laborers, skilled workers also did laborer's work, and laborers also did skilled workers' work. When the materials ran out, the workers had to stop working to find them themselves. This could not improve efficiency and could not guarantee quality. At that time, the well-sinking progress was always around two meters. In early April, the administrative leadership called on the engineering team members to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced assembly line operations and multi-head well-sinking methods. Worker Cao Pingliang responded to this call and came up with an improvement. He divided the six skilled workers into left and right groups, specializing in well-sinking. Each group had someone dedicated to supplying mortar, hitting the bell to flip the cans, and filling cement rubble. With a clear division of labor and fixed job types, the potential of the skilled workers was brought into play, overcoming idling and improving well-sinking efficiency. The engineering team also implemented a strict inspection system to ensure project specifications.

    The engineering team also improved the material supply work. In the past, the engineering team used a 50-horsepower electric winch to supply materials, which could only lower twelve well ring stones every five minutes. Working seven hours a day, it could only lower one thousand and eight pieces, which could sink 3.2 meters. However, when lowering the well ring stones, mortar and cement rubble could not be sent down. To solve this problem, the engineering team used a 25-horsepower steam winch, specializing in transporting mortar and cement. Therefore, the problem of insufficient material supply was also solved.

    When inspecting the quality of the project, the engineering team made full use of the alignment string to avoid affecting material supply. In the past, when sinking a well, the center line was hung and measured every six centimeters, which took twenty-five minutes each time, which affected the material lowering work. Now, alignment strings are generally used for measurement, and the center line is only hung once every meter. When hanging the alignment string, the material lowering work can be unaffected. This increases the material lowering time by one hundred and twenty-five minutes per day.

    The Beixiaojing Well Engineering Team also adopted a chart system to manage production. In the past, various work types could not be well-connected, wasting a lot of time. Now, charts are developed based on the rules of work, and work is done according to the charts, saving a lot of time. Based on the improvement of work, the leadership rewarded the workers in a timely manner according to the principle of payment according to work. The work team continuously created new records in May: 7.4 meters per day on May 14 (originally 3.1 meters per day); 8.4 meters per day on May 15; 9.6 meters per day on May 16; and an average of 7.1 meters per day in the first half of May. The Beixiaojing Well project has now been completed. (Chu Qiao)

    改进劳动组织和操作方法
    焦作矿务局连创砌井新纪录
    焦作矿务局李封矿北小井基本建设工程队在砌井工程中，调整了劳动组织，实行了流水作业法，改进了操作方法，创造了砌井日进九点六公尺的新纪录，工程质量完全合乎规格。李封矿北小井原为直径一点五公尺的土窑，供南井配风使用。李封矿正在开辟新工作面，井口提升能力急需加大，南井的提升能力已不能满足生产的需要，因此，领导方面决定把北小井的直径扩大为六公尺，并延深十九公尺。
    北小井工程队首先改进了劳动组织，实行了流水作业法。过去该队的劳动组织非常混乱，分工不明确，工种不固定，下井以后，班长、组长才临时布置工作。因此，窝工现象严重，影响工程进度。那时，虽然也有技术工和杂工的区别，但是技术工也干杂工的活，杂工也干技术工的活。等到材料用完了，工人还得停下工自己去找。这样就不能提高效率，不能保证质量。当时砌井进度总是在二公尺左右。四月初，行政领导方面号召工程队队员学习苏联先进的流水作业法和多头砌井法。工人曹平亮响应了这个号召，想出了改进办法。他把六个技术工分为左右两组，专管砌井。每组有人专门供给灰浆，打钟翻罐，填洋灰砟。分工明确，工种固定后，技术工的潜在能力发挥出来，克服了窝工现象，提高了砌井效率。工程队同时实行了严格的检查制度，保证了工程规格。
    工程队也改进了材料供应工作。过去，工程队用五十马力的电绞车供应材料，每五分钟只能下十二块井圈石，每日工作七小时，只能下一千零八块，可砌三点二公尺。但在下井圈石的时候，灰浆和洋灰砟就不能往下送了。为了解决这个问题，工程队利用了一部二十五马力的汽绞车，专门运输灰浆和洋灰。因此，材料供应不足的问题也解决了。
    在检查工程质量时，工程队充分利用了帮线，以免影响供料。过去砌井时，每砌六公寸，就挂中线测量一次，每次需要二十五分钟，这就影响了下料工作。现在一般都用帮线测量，每砌一公尺才挂中线一次。挂帮线时，下料工作可以不受影响。这样，每天就增加了一百二十五分钟的下料时间。
    北小井工程队还采用了图表制，管理生产。过去，各工种不能很好地衔接，浪费时间很多。现在根据工作中的规律，制定图表，按照图表工作，节省了很多时间。在改进工作的基础上，领导方面根据按劳取酬的原则，对工人及时进行奖励。该工作队在五月份连续创造了新纪录：五月十四日日进七点四公尺（原来日进三点一公尺）；十五日日进八点四公尺；十六日日进九点六公尺；五月上半月平均日进七点一公尺。北小井的工程现在已经完成。（初樵）
