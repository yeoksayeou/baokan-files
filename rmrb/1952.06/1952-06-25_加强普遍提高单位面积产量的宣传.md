    Strengthen the Publicity of Universally Increasing Yield per Unit Area

    The requirement of increasing yield per unit area and launching a patriotic agricultural production increase campaign is, first, to mobilize and increase production universally; second, to focus on key areas and cultivate model high-yield examples. Only in this way can the broad masses of farmers be organized to strive for a universal increase in yield per unit area. The task of local newspapers lies in correctly and repeatedly publicizing this, correcting the deviations of focusing only on model high-yield examples while neglecting universal production increase, and focusing only on a few mutual aid teams while neglecting universal mobilization.

    The main problem currently existing in various localities in increasing yield per unit area and launching a patriotic agricultural production increase campaign is that this movement is not widespread or thorough enough. Taking the provinces of North China as an example, some farmers still do not understand or do not fully understand the significance of the policy of increasing yield per unit area. They do not know that this policy requires all parts of the country to universally increase the existing yield per unit area based on different conditions and production conditions, and on this basis, strive for "high yields of certain crops." They oppose universally increasing yield per unit area and striving for high yields of certain crops, focusing only on the fertilization and processing of high-yield mu (unit of area) while neglecting the universal production increase requirements of most land, seeking high yields on a few plots of land by reducing the harvest of most crops. For example, in the Ninth District of Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, some farmers concentrated the fertilizer from ten mu of land onto one mu of land. This deviation also exists to varying degrees in other regions. In areas where this deviation exists, the patriotic agricultural production increase campaign centered on increasing yield per unit area is only limited to a small circle of a few labor models and advanced mutual aid teams, or only to the high-yield competition of certain crops; it has not driven all mutual aid teams and the broad masses of farmers to participate in the competition to achieve the policy of universally increasing yield per unit area. As the Pingyuan Daily editorial on May 12 stated: "The movement is very unbalanced, not widespread, and not thorough. Out of the 56 counties in the province, only 42 counties have launched a patriotic production increase campaign so far, and 14 counties have not launched it at all." Even some local labor model mutual aid teams only focused on challenging and responding to challenges from the whole country and the whole province, but neglected the most important production increase preparation and the actual work of realizing the production increase plan. For example, the agricultural production cooperative led by the famous labor model Geng Changsuo in Hebei Province, precisely because the high-yield plan was not specific enough, the entire cooperative's high-yield land was not applied with fine fertilizer during spring plowing; after the high-yield cotton was sown, it was not well processed, the cotton seeds withered in the soil, and the cotton seedlings did not emerge completely; the high-yield corn was sown too sparsely, so it was destroyed and re-sown, affecting timely sowing.

    In terms of newspaper publicity and education in this regard, some newspapers have done very poorly. They have not repeatedly educated farmers on universal production increase in light of the above-mentioned actual situation, have not promptly criticized certain incorrect ideas among the masses of farmers and corrected certain deviations in the actual movement, and some newspapers have even made inappropriate commendations. On April 19, the Chahar Daily published the "Circular of the Chahar Provincial People's Government on the Situation of Three High-Yield Villages in Huairen County." The "Circular" commended the Ji Ke Gong High-Yield Team. This circular stated: The Ji Ke Gong High-Yield Team in Fengzhuang Village, with a total of ninety mu of land, in order to complete the production increase task, planned to concentrate more than ninety carts of manure, more than one hundred dan (unit of weight) of kang soil, and six hundred and fifty jin (unit of weight) of fine fertilizer all on fifty mu of good land, and the remaining forty mu of alkaline land would not be fertilized or would be less fertilized, yielding as much as possible. Finally, it concluded: "Only in this way can the patriotic high-yield plan be completed." Although this approach can enable some land to achieve high yields and break the conservative thinking of farmers, it also fosters the erroneous view among some farmers that "only good land can increase production." This view is a conservative idea on the other hand, negating the necessity and possibility of using artificial means to transform the land. This is greatly unfavorable to the overall development of agricultural production. However, the Chahar Daily not only did not criticize this but instead commended and advocated it. This is very wrong. As for the situation that the production increase competition movement is not widespread and thorough, it can be explained from the reports of the Hebei Daily. The competition should be based on mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers should also be absorbed to participate. State-owned farms should also carry out competitions and can compete with farmers. Hebei Province has more than one hundred state-owned farms, nearly a thousand agricultural production cooperatives, more than one million agricultural labor mutual aid teams and technical groups, and more than one hundred thousand labor models and technical experts. However, the competition movement reported by the Hebei Daily in recent months has been limited to twelve state-owned farms, sixty-four agricultural production cooperatives, and four hundred and two agricultural labor mutual aid teams. This reflects the lack of universality of the actual movement on the one hand, and also shows that the newspaper does not pay enough attention to this shortcoming and has not promptly guided and promoted the participation of the broad masses of farmers in the high-yield competition movement through its own publicity and reporting work.

    Since mid-May, the Hebei Daily, Shanxi Daily, Pingyuan Daily, and other newspapers have begun to pay attention to the situation that the movement is not widespread and thorough. The Hebei Daily used a large amount of space to publish reports on the chain competition in six counties including Daming (see the May 16 issue of the newspaper) and the news that the competition movement in various counties of the Dingxian Special District has developed from points to areas (May 26). Such reports have a certain effect on universally launching the patriotic production increase competition movement and guiding the broad masses of farmers to move forward under the banner of high-yield models. In the report "Daming County's Letter of Challenge to Raoyang County," the newspaper also implemented the policy of universally increasing yield per unit area. In the conditions of this challenge, there are general production increase requirements and special high-yield requirements. It did not neglect universal production increase because it required high yields on some land, which is in line with the spirit of the instructions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on "the conditions of the competition should focus on universally increasing yield per unit area" and "secondly, high yields of certain crops." For example, the Shanxi Daily required that in the evaluation and summary of the patriotic production increase competition, it must be based on mutual aid teams, with labor models as the backbone, and attract the participation of the broad masses of individual farmers, and carry out the evaluation and summary from bottom to top in order to achieve the purpose of exchanging high-yield experiences, deepening and expanding the competition movement, and universally increasing yield per unit area; the Pingyuan Daily commended the Li Qiyuan Mutual Aid Team in Shawo Village, Qixian County for its practice of expanding investment and ensuring that every mu of land produces more grain. This shows that the above-mentioned newspapers have improved their publicity and reporting work in this regard.

    In order to further strengthen the publicity of universally increasing yield per unit area, all newspapers must first clearly recognize that the policy of launching the agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement is that universally increasing yield per unit area and focusing on cultivating high-yield models are inseparable. Neglecting the publicity of high-yield models will not give farmers a direction to strive for in increasing yield per unit area; but if we deviate from the basis of universally increasing yield per unit area and only conduct publicity on high-yield models in some areas, we will not be able to organize the broad masses of farmers in the production increase competition movement, and we will not be able to universally increase yield per unit area, which will affect the country's requirements for agricultural production increase. Therefore, it is still very insufficient to limit the publicity of universally increasing yield per unit area to the high yields of a few labor models, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams. In terms of mobilizing the broad masses of farmers to participate in the competition, all newspapers should vigorously publicize the policy of universal mobilization and focused control through reports on vivid actual examples to guide the movement to go deeper and more balanced. That is to say, it is necessary to be based on mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, with party members, league members, labor models, and production activists as the backbone, and strengthen the leadership of individual farmers, and promote the universal development of this movement from point to area. All newspapers must also educate and organize the broad masses of farmers through reports on various forms of competition among the masses. First of all, attention should be paid to comprehensive production increase competitions including various crops, and secondly, attention should also be paid to single-item production increase competitions for a certain crop. At the same time, attention must also be paid to the production increase competition in a large area between villages and counties. The content of the competition should be concise, specific, and easy to compare. It is necessary to prevent formalistic reports that are all-encompassing and lack a demonstration effect, and also oppose the tendency of trophyism that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and pay special attention to conducting ideological education on increasing yield per unit area and patriotism for the large number of individual farmers. Only in this way can newspapers further strengthen the publicity of universally increasing yield per unit area and play a role in promoting the agricultural production increase competition movement.

### 加强普遍提高单位面积产量的宣传

    加强普遍提高单位面积产量的宣传
    提高单位面积产量、开展爱国农业增产竞赛运动的要求，首先是普遍发动普遍增产，其次是重点掌握，重点培养丰产典型。这样才能组织广大农民为普遍地提高每一单位面积产量而奋斗。各地报纸的任务就在于正确地反覆宣传，纠正那些只注意丰产典型而忽视普遍增产，只注意少数互助组而忽视普遍发动的偏向。
    当前各地在提高单位面积产量、开展爱国农业增产竞赛运动中存在的主要问题，就是这一运动开展得不够普遍，不够深入。以华北各省来说，有些农民还不了解或不完全了解提高单位面积产量这一方针的意义，不知道这一方针所要求的，是要全国各地根据不同情况和生产条件，普遍做到把现有的单位面积产量提高一步，并在这一基础上争取“某种作物的高额产量”。他们把普遍提高单位面积产量和争取某种作物的高额产量对立起来，只注意了丰产亩的施肥加工，而忽视了大部土地的普遍增产要求，以降低大部庄稼收成来求得少数土地的高额产量。譬如，平原省安阳县九区有的农民把十亩地的肥料集中到一亩地里。这种偏差在其他地区也或多或少地存在着。凡有此种偏差的地区，在以提高单位面积产量为中心的爱国农业增产竞赛运动，也只是停留在几个劳动模范、先进互助组的狭小圈子里，或只停留在某种作物的丰产竞赛上；没有带动所有互助组和广大农民参加竞赛，以实现普遍提高单位面积产量的方针。这正如五月十二日平原日报的社论所说：“运动开展的很不平衡，很不普遍，很不深入。全省五十六个县，直到现在只有四十二个县开展了爱国增产竞赛运动，还有十四个县根本没有开展。”甚至有些地方的劳动模范互助组，只注意了向全国全省挑战应战，却忽视了最重要的增产准备和实现增产计划的实际工作。例如，河北著名劳动模范耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社，就是因为丰产计划订得不够具体，致使全社的丰产地在春耕时都没有施细肥；丰产棉花播种后，又没有很好加工，棉籽在土里干枯，棉苗都没有出全；丰产玉米则因耩得太稀，毁了又耩，影响适时下种。
    就报纸在这一方面的宣传教育来说，有些报纸是做得很差的。并没有针对上述实际情况，向农民反覆进行关于普遍增产的教育，没有及时批判农民群众中某些不正确思想和纠正实际运动中的某些偏差，甚至有的报纸作了不恰当的表扬。四月十九日察哈尔日报发表了“察哈尔省人民政府关于怀仁县三个丰产村情况的通报”，“通报”表扬了纪克功丰产组。这个通报中说：冯庄村的纪克功丰产组，共九十亩地，为了完成增产任务，计划把九十多车粪、百多担炕土、六百五十斤细肥全部集中用在五十亩好地上，其余四十亩碱地不上粪或少上粪，能收多少算多少。最后并得出结论说：“只有这样才能完成爱国丰产计划。”这样的作法，固然可以使部分土地达到高额产量，打破农民的保守思想，但同时也助长了某些农民认为“只有好地，才能增产”的错误观点。这种观点是另一方面的保守思想，抹杀了用人工改造土地的必要性和可能性。这是大大不利于农业生产的全面发展的。可是察哈尔日报对此不但不给予批判，反而加以表扬和提倡。这是很不对的。至于增产竞赛运动不普遍不深入的状况，则可以从河北日报的报道中得到说明。竞赛应以互助组或农业生产合作社为主，并吸收个体农民参加，国营农场也应开展竞赛，并可与农民竞赛。河北全省有百余个国营农场，近千个农业生产合作社，百万以上的农业劳动互助组、技术组，十万多个劳动模范和技术能手。可是河北日报在近数月来所报道的竞赛运动，则仅限于十二个国营农场、六十四个农业生产合作社、四百零二个农业劳动互助组。这一方面反映了实际运动的不普遍，另一方面也说明了报纸对这种缺点不够注意，没有及时地通过自己的宣传报道工作，引导并推动广大农民参加丰产竞赛运动。
    从五月中旬以后，河北日报、山西日报、平原日报等在农业生产报道中，已开始注意运动不普遍不深入的情况。河北日报用了大量篇幅刊登了大名等六县的连环竞赛（见五月十六日该报）和定县专区各县竞赛运动由点向面发展的消息（五月二十六日）。这样的报道对于普遍开展爱国增产竞赛运动，并引导广大农民在丰产模范的旗帜下前进，是有一定作用的。该报在“大名县向饶阳县的挑战书”的报道中，同样贯彻了普遍提高单位面积产量的方针。在这个挑战的条件中，有一般的增产要求，也有特殊的丰产要求。它没有因为要求部分土地丰产，而忽视了普遍增产，这是符合中央人民政府农业部关于“竞赛的条件应集中在普遍提高单位面积产量上”、“其次是某种作物的高额产量”的指示的精神的。他如山西日报要求在爱国增产竞赛评比总结中，必须以互助组为基础，劳动模范为骨干，并吸引广大单干农民参加，自下而上地进行评比总结，以达到交流丰产经验、深入和扩大竞赛运动、普遍提高单位面积产量的目的；平原日报表扬了淇县沙窝村李启元互助组用扩大投资、保证每亩地都多打粮食的作法。这都说明了上述报纸对这一方面的宣传报道工作有了改进。
    为了更进一步地加强普遍提高单位面积产量的宣传，各报首先要明确认识开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动的方针是：普遍提高单位面积产量和重点培养丰产典型是不可分割的，忽视了对丰产典型的宣传，就不能给农民提高单位面积产量以努力的方向；但如果离开普遍提高单位面积产量这一基础，而仅仅进行部分地亩丰产典型的宣传，那就不能把广大农民组织在增产竞赛运动中，就不能使单位面积产量普遍提高，而影响国家农业增产的要求。因此，把普遍提高单位面积产量的宣传停留在少数劳动模范、农业生产合作社和互助组的丰产上面，还是非常不够的。在发动广大农民参加竞赛这一方面，各报应该通过生动的实际事例的报道，大力宣传普遍发动、重点掌握的方针，引导运动走向深入和平衡。这就是说，必须以互助组、农业生产合作社为基础，以党员、团员、劳动模范、生产积极分子为骨干，并加强对单干农民的领导，由点到面地推进这一运动的普遍发展。各报还须通过对群众中多种多样竞赛形式的报道，以教育和组织广大农民。首先应注意包括多种农作物在内的全面增产竞赛，其次还应注意某一种农作物的单项增产竞赛。同时还必须注意村与村、县与县之间的广大面积的增产竞赛。报道竞赛的内容要简明、具体、易于比较。既要防止包罗万象的缺乏示范作用的形式主义报道，又要反对脱离群众脱离实际的锦标主义倾向，还要特别注意对大量存在的单干农民进行关于提高单位面积产量和爱国主义的思想教育。只有这样，报纸才能进一步加强普遍提高单位面积产量的宣传，发挥报纸在农业增产竞赛运动中的推进作用。
