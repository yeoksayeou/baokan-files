    Victoriously Concluding the "Five-Anti" Movement
    As the "Three-Anti" movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy enters its construction phase across the country, the "Five-Anti" movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, which has been carried out in the business community of many large and medium-sized cities, is also entering its concluding phase. Now, the State Council of the Central People's Government has timely issued the "Instructions on Several Issues in Concluding the 'Five-Anti' Movement," which is of great significance for achieving the victorious conclusion of the "Five-Anti" movement and further developing production. All large and medium-sized cities that have carried out the "Five-Anti" movement must strictly implement these instructions to ensure that this great social reform movement achieves a successful outcome, which will benefit the development of our country's future construction endeavors.
    Like the great "Three-Anti" movement, the great "Five-Anti" movement has brought a vigorous new atmosphere to our country, generating many positive factors in all aspects of social and economic life, and beginning to demonstrate many important changes that are conducive to the development of the people's democratic economy. In seven major cities across the country, the prices of a large number of commodities have reasonably decreased by an average of about 5% in the past three months. All private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have gained new conditions for prosperity, and many law-abiding business owners feel that "it is easier to do honest business." In particular, the increased production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has moved many capitalists to say, "I was wrong in the past. Now I see that the workers do not want to ruin the factory, but want to make the factory better. If I don't work hard, I will be letting down the government and the workers." According to statistics from dozens of larger factories in the private machinery and iron industry in May, the quality of products generally increased by about 20% to 30%, the output increased by about 15% to 30%, and the cost decreased by an average of about 30% to 40%. All of these fully demonstrate that the direct effects of the "Five-Anti" movement on our country's social and economic life are enormous. This movement is in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people and is therefore supported by them.
    The broad masses of the people in our country unanimously believe that the "Five-Anti" movement has an extremely great significance as a social reform that transforms customs and habits. It has eliminated and continues to eliminate the long-standing bad habits of illegal business owners who have habitually practiced the "five poisons"; it has changed and continues to change the erroneous view of some people from the old society who regarded speculation, profiteering, petty scheming, and theft of state property as "smart and capable, with skills," and now regard the behavior of the "five poisons" as shameful. The broad masses of the people hope that the national bourgeoisie can honestly implement the Common Program from now on, and can abide by the rules and engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the leadership of the state-owned economy. The broad masses of the people have expressed their determination to assist the People's Government in victoriously concluding the "Five-Anti" movement and to strive to consolidate its victorious achievements.
    However, as the "Five-Anti" movement enters its concluding phase today, there are still some specific issues that must be correctly resolved, the main ones being the classification and handling of business owners, the verification and finalization of cases, and the refund of property and payment of taxes. Now, the instructions issued by the State Council have made important principled provisions for the correct and appropriate resolution of these issues. Therefore, the correct implementation of these instructions has become a crucial key to achieving the victorious conclusion of the "Five-Anti" movement.
    The principle for handling business owners must be "strict in struggle, lenient in handling; strict where strictness is due, lenient where leniency is due." Because the purpose of the "Five-Anti" movement is by no means to make private industry and commerce collapse, but to eliminate the "five poisons" of illegal business owners, so that the national bourgeoisie can develop production well under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and use the enthusiasm of private capital in aspects that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we must not only oppose the right-leaning phenomenon of ending things in a perfunctory and sloppy manner; but also oppose the left-leaning phenomenon of disregarding the actual situation and failing to seriously verify and finalize cases.
    In order to correctly grasp the principles of finalizing and handling cases, business owners must be correctly classified. The standards and methods for classifying and handling business owners in the "Five-Anti" movement of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, which were approved and promulgated by the State Council on March 8 this year, are basically in line with the situation in various localities regarding the division of the five categories of business owners. In finalizing and handling cases, all localities must proceed from the actual situation, comprehensively and practically analyze the various parts of the bourgeoisie, and correctly grasp the proportion of classification. Grasping the proportion of classification is by no means simply grasping numbers, but is the central issue of proceeding from the actual situation and correctly implementing policies. When specifically dividing the various categories of business owners, in addition to seeing the amount of their illegal income, we should also comprehensively see their illegal nature, illegal circumstances, political attitude, and economic role. This is an important issue in comprehensively understanding and correctly treating the bourgeoisie. On this issue, only by adhering to the principle of combining leniency and strictness can we achieve a reasonable and rational outcome, and achieve what the State Council's instructions said: "It is both conducive to eliminating the 'five poisons' of industrialists and businessmen, and conducive to uniting industrialists and businessmen to develop production and business."
    The calculation of the amount of illegal income of business owners involves some cases of retroactive calculation over a longer period, higher depreciation, and a broader scope of calculation. Now these must be re-verified and finalized. Doing so is entirely reasonable and necessary. Since the purpose of the "Five-Anti" movement is to eliminate the "five poisons" and not for other purposes, then it is obviously wrong to calculate the illegal income too high or too low. The State Council has correctly taken this into account, on the one hand, to save the verification by the inspection committees; on the other hand, allowing illegal business owners to request review or retrial by the review committee or the people's court if they disagree, so as to achieve fairness and reasonableness. At the same time, the purpose of doing so is also to enable industry and commerce to recover and develop rapidly. We should make all cadres and the masses understand that if the amount of illegal income of business owners is calculated too high or too broadly, it will affect the future production and operation of these business owners, and will weaken the effect of the "Five-Anti" movement. Only after carefully comparing, analyzing, and verifying the capital, turnover, net profit of capitalists, and the illegal income initially calculated in the "Five-Anti" movement, can we correctly verify the amount of illegal income to be returned. The State Council's instructions stipulate that "what should not be calculated must not be calculated, what can be calculated or not calculated should not be calculated, and what should be calculated must be calculated," which must become an unshakable principle in the verification work of various localities.
    Only after correct verification and finalization can the issues of refunding property and paying taxes and a small number of fines be reasonably resolved. The methods for refunding property, paying taxes, and a small number of fines stipulated in the State Council's instructions provide various considerations for illegal business owners, which is also entirely necessary. Because only by handling things in this way, both seriously and leniently, can we eliminate the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists, and enable private industry and commerce to find their place, rapidly recover and develop the economy, and enable general capitalists to still have a surplus after refunding property and paying taxes. Fines are limited to a very small number, generally no fines are imposed, what can be fined or not fined must not be fined, and even for the very few that must be fined, they can continue to maintain production and operation after the fine. The result of the implementation of this instruction will be that private industry and commerce will be reborn after the "Five-Anti" movement, and they will continue to play a certain role in future economic construction.
    In order to implement the State Council's instructions and victoriously conclude the "Five-Anti" movement, the leading organs in various localities should conduct full research and discussion, formulate specific plans for implementing these instructions, and convene various meetings, including meetings of workers and shop assistants and meetings of industrialists and businessmen, to repeatedly explain the policies of the People's Government, and continue to rely closely on the masses of workers and shop assistants and the inspection teams, and hand over the policies to them to grasp. They have already made great contributions in the "Five-Anti" movement, and they will certainly be able to continue to work hard to victoriously conclude the "Five-Anti" movement and to consolidate the achievements of this movement. At the same time, cities that have carried out the "Five-Anti" movement should quickly establish democratic review institutions, with leading cadres personally taking action and conducting typical demonstrations, so that all cities that have carried out the "Five-Anti" movement can quickly and successfully conclude this movement, and on the basis of the victory of this movement, further restore and develop production, so as to carry out large-scale economic construction work.

### 胜利地结束“五反”运动

    胜利地结束“五反”运动
    在全国各地反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的“三反”运动进入建设阶段的时候，许多大城市和中等城市工商界中所进行的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的“五反”运动，也已经进入结束阶段了。现在，中央人民政府政务院及时地发布了“关于结束‘五反’运动中几个问题的指示”，这对于争取“五反”运动的胜利结束和进一步发展生产具有重大的意义。所有进行了“五反”运动的大、中城市都必须严格地执行这个指示，使这一次伟大的社会改革运动获得圆满的结果，以利于我国今后建设事业的发展。
    伟大的“五反”运动和伟大的“三反”运动一样，给我们的国家带来了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，在社会经济生活的各方面产生了许多积极的因素，开始表现了有利于人民民主经济发展的许多重要变化。全国七大城市的大批商品牌价，近三个月来平均合理地下降了约百分之五。一切有利于国计民生的私人企业都得到了新的繁荣条件，许多守法的工商户感到“守本分的买卖容易做了”；尤其是广大工人群众生产积极性的提高，使许多资本家不能不感动地说：“过去我想错了，现在我才看出工人不是想搞垮厂子，而是想把厂子搞好，我再不好好干真对不起政府和工人。”据私营机器铁工业的几十个较大工厂五月份的统计，产品质量一般地提高了百分之二十至三十左右，产量提高了百分之十五至三十左右，成本平均降低了百分之三十至四十左右。这些都充分地说明了“五反”运动在我国社会经济生活中所发生的直接效果是巨大的，这个运动是符合于广大人民的利益因而得到广大人民拥护的。
    我国广大人民都一致认为“五反”运动具有极其伟大的移风易俗的社会改革的意义。它清除了并继续清除着不法工商户多年来惯施“五毒”的恶习；它改变了并继续改变着从旧社会来的某些人们认为投机取巧、钻营牟利、蝇营狗苟、盗窃国家资财是
    “聪明能干、有本领”的错误看法，而把“五毒”的行为视为可耻的了。广大人民都希望民族资产阶级，从今以后能够老老实实地实行共同纲领，能够规规矩矩地在国营经济领导下从事有益于国计民生的事业。广大人民都表示决心协助人民政府，胜利地结束“五反”运动，并努力巩固它的胜利成果。
    但是，在“五反”运动进入结束阶段的今天，还有若干具体问题必须予以正确的解决，其中主要的是对于工商户分类处理、核实定案和退财补税等问题。现在政务院发布的指示，对于正确地适当地解决这些问题作了重要的原则性规定，因此，正确执行这个指示，就成为目前争取“五反”运动胜利结束的重要关键。
    对于工商户处理的原则必须是“斗争从严，处理从宽；应当严者严之，应当宽者宽之”。因为“五反”运动的目的绝不是要使私营工商业垮台，而是要消除不法工商户的“五毒”，以便于民族资产阶级能够在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下好好地发展生产，使私人资本的积极性用到有利于国计民生的方面。因此，我们不但必须反对虎头蛇尾、草率结束的右倾现象；而且必须反对不顾实际情况、不认真核实定案的左倾现象。
    为了正确掌握定案处理的原则，对工商户必须作正确的分类。今年三月八日政务院批准公布的北京市人民政府在“五反”运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法，对于五类工商户的划分，基本上是合乎各地情况的。各地在定案处理中必须从实际情况出发，全面地切实分析资产阶级的各个部分，正确掌握分类的比例。掌握分类的比例决不是简单地掌握数字，而是从实际情况出发、正确执行政策的中心问题。在对各类工商户进行具体划分的时候，除了应该看到他们违法所得的数目以外，还应该全面地看到他们的违法性质、违法情节、政治态度和在经济上的作用等各种情况。这是全面地认识和正确地对待资产阶级的一个重要问题。在这个问题上，只有坚持宽大与严肃相结合的方针，才能做到合情合理，做到政务院指示中所说的“既有利于清除工商业者的‘五毒’，又有利于团结工商业者发展生产和营业”。
    对于工商户违法所得数目的计算，有些是追算较远、折价较高、计算范围较广的。现在对于这些要重新加以核实定案。这样做是完全合理和必要的。因为“五反”运动的目的，既然是为了消除“五毒”，而不是为了其他，那末，对于违法所得计算得过高过低显然都是不对的。政务院正确地照顾了这一点，一方面要节约检查委员会进行核实；一方面允许不法工商户有不服时，可以提请评议委员会或人民法庭复议或复审，务要做到公平合理。同时，这样做的目的也是为了使工商业能够迅速恢复和发展。我们应该使所有的干部和群众都了解，如果把工商户违法所得的数目计算过高、过广，就会影响这些工商户今后的生产和经营，就会减弱了“五反”运动的效果。只有慎重地把资本家的资产额、营业额、纯益额和“五反”运动中初步计算的违法所得，做了详尽的比较、分析和核实之后，才能正确地核定其应退的违法所得的数目。政务院指示中规定“不应该计算的一定不要计算，可计算可不计算的也不要计算，而应该计算的则必须计算”，这必须成为各地核定工作中不可动摇的原则。
    只有在正确地核实定案之后，退财补税及少数罚款的问题才能得到合理的解决。政务院的指示中所规定的关于退财补税及少数罚款的办法，给予了违法工商户以种种照顾，这也是完全必要的。因为只有这样既严肃又宽大的处理，才能够消除不法资本家的“五毒”，而又使私营工商业各得其所，迅速恢复和发展经济，使一般资本家在退财补税之后仍有盈余。罚款只限于极少数，一般地不予罚款，可罚可不罚的一定不罚，极少数非罚不可的，也使他们于罚款之后能够继续维持生产和经营。这个指示执行的结果，将使私营工商业在“五反”运动以后获得新生，使他们在今后的经济建设中继续起一定的作用。
    为了贯彻执行政务院的指示，胜利地结束“五反”运动，各地领导机关应该进行充分的研究和讨论，制定执行这个指示的具体计划，并分别召开各种会议，包括工人店员的会议和工商业者的会议，反复说明人民政府的政策，并继续紧紧地依靠工人店员群众和检查组，把政策交给他们去掌握。他们在“五反”运动中已经做了巨大的贡献，他们也一定能够为胜利地结束“五反”运动并为巩固这个运动的成果而继续努力。同时，已经进行了“五反”运动的城市，都应该迅速建立民主评议的机构，由领导干部亲自动手，进行典型示范，使已经进行了“五反”运动的各个城市，迅速地圆满地结束这个运动，并在这个运动胜利的基础上，进一步地恢复和发展生产，以便开展大规模的经济建设工作。
