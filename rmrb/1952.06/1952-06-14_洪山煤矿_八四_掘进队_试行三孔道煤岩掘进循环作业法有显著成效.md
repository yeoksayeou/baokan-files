    Hongshan Coal Mine "84" Tunneling Team
    Trial Implementation of Three-Hole Coal and Rock Tunneling Cyclic Operation Method Achieves Significant Results
    Comrade Editor: The state-owned Hongshan Coal Mine Mountain No. 3 Well "84" Tunneling Team began trial implementation of Ma Liu Hai's multi-hole tunneling cyclic operation in January of this year, with certain achievements. On this basis, in mid-April, they began trial implementation of a three-hole coal and rock tunneling cyclic operation. During the trial, with high patriotic enthusiasm, they earnestly implemented chart management and individual responsibility systems, and improved the deep-hole blasting technology in coal seams. This fully utilized the potential of mechanical equipment and labor, greatly improving work efficiency. The original daily progress of single-hole tunneling was 7.65 meters, which has now been increased to 16.8 meters. Currently, the average coal and rock efficiency is 1.782 cubic meters, an increase of 64.2 percent compared to the past single-hole rapid tunneling. In the past, each pneumatic drill drilled 36 meters of rock per day, but after implementing this cyclic operation, it increased to 109.8 meters. Moreover, the three-hole coal and rock tunneling cyclic operation has also promoted the improvement of labor organization, making the division of labor more scientific. If this preliminary experience is further enriched and developed, the coal mine tunneling work will surely move further forward. To encourage and commend the spirit of the "84" Tunneling Team's workers in learning advanced production experience, the administrative leading cadres of Hongshan Coal Mine specially awarded the team's workers a bonus of 10 million yuan.

    洪山煤矿“八四”掘进队
    试行三孔道煤岩掘进循环作业法有显著成效
    编辑同志：国营洪山煤矿山三井“八四”掘进队，今年一月开始试行马六孩多孔道掘进循环作业，有一定成绩。在这一基础上，四月中旬他们又试行三孔道煤岩掘进循环作业。在试行中，他们以高度的爱国热情，认真贯彻了图表管理和个人专责制，改进了煤层深眼爆破技术。这就充分发挥了机械设备和劳动力的潜在能力，使工作效率大为提高。原来单孔道掘进的日进度是七点六五公尺，现在已经提高到十六点八公尺。现在，煤岩平均效率是一点七八二立方，比过去单孔道快速掘进提高了百分之六十四点二。过去每台风钻每天岩层打眼三十六公尺，实行这个循环作业后，增加到一百零九点八公尺。而且，三孔道煤岩掘进循环作业，还推动了劳动组织的改进，使分工更加科学。对这一初步经验，如再加以丰富和发展，煤矿掘进工作一定会更前进一步。为鼓励和表扬“八四”掘进队职工学习先进生产经验的精神，洪山煤矿行政领导干部特奖该队职工奖金一千万元。  江枫
