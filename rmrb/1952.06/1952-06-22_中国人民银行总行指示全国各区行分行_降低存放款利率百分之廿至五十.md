Xinhua News Agency, 20th. In view of the new situation after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, where speculation has subsided, the black market has been eliminated, and prices have further stabilized, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China has instructed all regional and branch offices to lower current deposit and loan interest rates by 20% to 50% within June. This is to reduce industrial and commercial costs, expand rural credit, quickly revitalize the market, facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, develop production, and welcome a new upsurge in construction.

    The standards for this reduction are as follows: (1) The loan interest rate for private industrial and commercial enterprises will be reduced from the current 2.4% to 3% to 1.05% to 1.65% per month for industry, and 1.35% to 1.95% per month for commerce, a reduction of 30% to 50%. (2) The loan interest rate for public enterprises will be reduced from the current 1% to 1.5% to 0.6% to 1.2%. a reduction of 20% to 40%. (3) Along with the reduction of loan interest rates, the interest rates for general deposits and savings deposits will also be appropriately adjusted, and the difference between deposit and loan interest rates will be narrowed to encourage depositors to save. At the same time as lowering interest rates, insured deposits with value guarantee and real interest rate deposits will be discontinued. (4) The state bank will adopt a policy of large-scale loans and low-interest preferential treatment for agricultural production. The monthly interest rate for agricultural production loans will be set at 1% to 1.5%, and for water conservancy at 0.75% to 0.9%. (5) The loan interest rate for cooperatives will be the same as that for public enterprises and will be given a 10% preference to support the development of the cooperative economy.

    The Head Office pointed out: This interest rate reduction provides favorable conditions for the legitimate operation and development of industries and businesses across the country. It must be made clear that the People's Government has consistently and resolutely implemented the correct policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, corruption and theft have been eradicated, and market prices have shown overall stability and some decline. Speculation has subsided, and the black market has been eliminated. In the future, prices will become more stable, and the profits of industry and commerce will become more normal. Interest rates must be lowered in a timely manner to reduce industrial and commercial costs, protect their reasonable profits, and encourage industry and commerce to actively operate and develop production.

    Regarding the significance of lowering public interest rates, the Head Office pointed out that it lies in further supporting the development of the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy, strengthening the credit relationship between state-owned enterprises and banks, reducing commodity production and circulation costs, and increasing the accumulation of construction funds.

    As for the adjustment of savings interest rates, the Head Office believes that it is to meet the needs of national economic construction, reduce savings costs, and provide low-interest funds needed for economic construction to build our great motherland. With stable prices and the adjustment of social profits, high interest rates and complex storage methods will become unreasonable and unnecessary. After the interest rate is lowered and the method is simplified, local banks should further integrate with the needs of the masses' daily lives. Strengthening services to depositors and facilitating depositors' deposits and withdrawals, the patriotic savings movement under the principle of voluntarism will be further developed.

    Regarding the role of the state bank in implementing a low-interest policy for agricultural production, the Head Office pointed out that it is to develop agricultural and sideline production in a planned way, invigorate the rural economy, and promote the development of new production methods. At the same time, the interest rates for rural revolving loans will be studied and stipulated by local authorities according to the situation, so as to take care of the specific local conditions and protect the development of new rural lending relationships.

    The instruction also emphasized that this interest rate reduction is an important measure to adapt to the current economic situation, encourage private industry and commerce to actively develop production, and revitalize the market. At the same time, it is also an important measure to provide low-interest funds for construction as the country shifts from economic recovery to economic construction. All levels of banks must complete this major task of reducing interest rates under the unified leadership of the local Party, government, and financial committees.

    中国人民银行总行指示全国各区行分行
    降低存放款利率百分之廿至五十
    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民银行总行鉴于伟大的“三反”“五反”运动以后，投机歛迹，黑市消除，物价已进一步稳定的新情况，特指示全国各区、分行在六月份内，将现行存、放款利率分别降低百分之二十至五十，以减低工商业成本，开展农村信用，迅速活跃市场，沟通城乡物资交流，发展生产，迎接新的建设高潮。
    此次降低的标准如下：（一）对私营工商业的放款利率，由现行的二分四至三分降低为工业月息一分零五至一分六厘五，商业月息一分三厘五至一分九厘五，降低了百分之三十至五十。（二）对公营企业的放款利率，由现行的一分至一分五厘，降低为六厘至一分二厘。降低了百分之二十至四十。（三）随着放款利息的降低，一般存款及储蓄存款利率也作了适当的调整，并且缩小了存放利率之间的差额，以鼓励存款者储存。与降低利率的同时，并停办保本保值存款与折实等存款。（四）国家银行对农业生产采取大量贷款和低利优待的政策，农业生产放款月息定为一分至一分五厘，水利定为七厘五到九厘。（五）对合作社的放款利率比照公营企业的放款利率并予以百分之十的优待，以扶助合作经济的发展。
    总行指出：这次降低利率是给全国工商业的正当经营和发展提供有利条件。必须明确人民政府过去和现在，都是坚决的执行着公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济的正确政策的。“三反”和
    “五反”运动以后，贪污盗窃被肃清了，市场物价出现了全面稳定的情况，且有部分下降。投机歛迹，黑市消除，今后物价将更形稳定，工商业利润也将日趋正常。利率必须及时下降，以减低工商业成本，保护其合理利润，鼓励工商业积极经营，发展生产。
    关于降低公营利率的意义，总行指出在于进一步扶助国营经济和合作社经济的发展，密切国营企业和银行的信贷关系，降低商品生产和流通费用，增加建设资金的积累。
    至于储蓄利率的调整，总行认为是为配合国家经济建设的需要，减低储蓄成本，以便提供经济建设所需要的低利资金，建设我们伟大的祖国。由于物价稳定，社会利润的调整，高额利息和复杂的储存方式，将变为不合理和不需要了，利息降低和方式简化之后各地银行应进一步与群众日常生活需要相结合。加强对储户的服务，便利于储户的存取，在自愿原则下的爱国主义储蓄运动将得到进一步的发展。
    关于国家银行对农业生产实行低利政策的作用，总行指出是为了有计划地发展农副业生产，活泼农村经济，促进新生产方式的发展。同时对农村周转性的借贷利息，由各地根据情况研究规定，这样照顾了各地具体情况，以保护农村新借贷关系的发展。
    指示并强调指出：此次利率降低是适应当前经济情况，鼓励私营工商业积极发展生产，活跃市场的重要措施，同时亦是配合由恢复经济转入经济建设时期为建设提供低利资金的重要措施。各级行必须在当地党政财委统一领导下完成此次降低利率的重大任务。
