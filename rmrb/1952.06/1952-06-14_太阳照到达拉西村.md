    Not long ago, we visited Dalaxi Village, a typical rural village in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, located at an altitude of 4,000 meters on the Kangzang Plateau, 150 li west of Kangding. When we arrived at the village, the spring plowing was over, and young men and women were singing and dancing on the meadow in front of the village, singing their favorite song:
    “The most precious thing in the world is the sun,
    The sun has shone on Dalaxi Village,
    It warms our farmhouses,
    And it warms the streams and pastures.
    Chairman Mao is our sun,
    Long live Chairman Mao!”
    From the faces of the people, full of heartfelt joy, no one would have thought that they had lived a life of hardship and misery just two years ago. Angbu Aji, a fifty-year-old Tibetan farmer, told us that before liberation, Dalaxi Village was a hell for sufferers. In the early years, there were more than thirty households in the village, but under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang bandits, only one household could eat tsampa all year round, nine households had neither land nor houses and relied entirely on begging for a living, more than half of the village's households had to beg for a living during the spring famine, and eight households had been completely wiped out. This old Tibetan lost more than twenty head of livestock while supporting "Ula" (corvée) for the Kuomintang bandits, and half of his land was abandoned, and he had to dig wild vegetables for half of the year to survive. He pointed to the thick butter tea and large pieces of milk cake that had been brewed for us and said, "These things were hard to see even in dreams in the past. The Communist Party rescued us. In just two years, we have been able to live a happy life."
    We held a survey meeting on the pasture, and everyone who attended happily described the happy life they had gained under the leadership of Chairman Mao. This year, there is not a single beggar in Dalaxi Village, and every household has houses and land. Now their common diet is four meals of tsampa and four cups of tea a day, with salt added to the tea, and they often eat butter and milk cakes. In the past two years, those without houses have built new houses, and those without plows have bought plows and built cowsheds. This year, almost everyone wore new clothes for the Spring Festival. They proudly pointed to the newly built stone houses, the large green crops, and the cattle grazing in the valleys; some even opened their sheepskin robes to show us their new "xianzi" (underwear). Mozhu Xiruo was a "huahu" (a household without a fixed income) who had been begging for twenty-two years without any property. After liberation, he worked for the PLA troops entering Tibet for eight months, and after deducting food for the whole family, he still had more than 300 jin of grain left. Last year, he received grain and farm implements lent by the people's government, reclaimed a lot of wasteland, planted wheat and highland barley in the fields, and bought a pair of cattle. With the help of the Tibetan villagers who donated wood, he has built a brand-new flat-roofed house next to his dilapidated white cloth tent; the stored food is enough to eat until the autumn harvest.
    The happy life of the people of Dalaxi Village is inseparable from the care of the people's government. Last year, the autonomous region government lent a large amount of grain and farm implements to Dalaxi Village. Du Qi Jiangcuo lacked seeds, and after the government lent him 240 jin of grain, he had a good harvest. With the help of the government, Abu planted all the land that had been abandoned for four or five years, and he used the 600 jin of potatoes left over from last year to exchange for tea and salt. Last year, the village's fields all had bumper harvests. In addition to their income from helping the troops entering Tibet transport and sell firewood, everyone lived a prosperous life. Now, the more than twenty Tibetan households in Dalaxi Village own more than 460 cattle, horses, and sheep. The area of ​​land cultivated in the village has increased from more than 300 ke last year to more than 560 ke (ke is a Tibetan unit of measurement, equivalent to about 35 jin; one ke of land is the area of land that can be sown with one ke of seeds), and a thriving crop is growing in the field.

    太阳照到达拉西村
    新华社记者  王甸、昌明
    不久以前，我们访问了在拔海四千公尺的康藏高原上的达拉西村，这是西康省藏族自治区的一个普通农村，在康定以西一百五十里的地方。我们到达了这个村庄的时候，春耕已过，青年男女们正在村前草地上载歌载舞，他们唱着自己心爱的歌：
    “人间最珍贵的是太阳，
    太阳已照到达拉西村庄，
    它照暖了我们的农舍，
    也照暖了流水和草场。
    毛主席是我们的太阳，
    毛主席万寿无疆！”
    从人们流露着衷心喜悦的脸上，谁也不会想到他们在两年前还过着辛酸悲惨的生活。五十岁的藏族农民昂布阿杰告诉我们：在解放以前，达拉西村是一个受难者的地狱，早年村里有过三十多户人家，但在国民党匪帮的残酷统治下，只有一户可以常年吃到糌粑，九家既无土地也无房屋，全靠行乞生活，全村一半以上的人家在春荒时要靠行乞为生，还有八户人家已绝灭了人烟。这位老藏民在为国民党匪帮支“乌拉”（差役）中先后损失了二十多头牲畜，土地也抛荒了一半，一年中有半年的时间靠挖野菜糊口。他指着为我们熬浓的酥油茶和大片的奶饼说：“这些东西过去在梦里也难见到，共产党把我们拯救了出来，才两年，我们已能过着幸福的生活了。”
    我们在草场上举行了一个调查会，到会的每一个人都欢快地叙述着自己在毛主席领导下获得的幸福生活。达拉西村今年已没有一个讨饭的人，家家户户都有了房屋和土地，现在他们普通的饮食是每天四顿糌粑、四次茶，茶里还加上了盐巴，时常还吃到酥油和奶饼。两年多来，村子里没房子的已盖了新房子，没有耕牛的买了耕牛，而且还架了牛棚。今年春节，几乎每人都穿上了新衣。他们骄傲地指点着一座座新砌的石屋，大片青绿的庄稼和放牧在山谷里的牛群；有些人还敞开身上的羊皮大袄露出新“弦子”（内衣）给我们看。莫珠惜若是一个讨口二十二年没有一点家产的“花户”，解放以后他帮中国人民解放军进藏部队做了八个月的工，除去全家的口粮外，还剩余三百多斤粮食。去年，他得到人民政府贷给的粮食和农具，开垦了不少荒地，在地里种上了小麦和青稞，还买了一对耕牛。由于全村藏民赠送木料的帮助，他在破旧的白布帐篷旁边，已经砌了一座崭新的平顶房屋；贮存的口粮，够吃到秋收。
    达拉西村人民的幸福生活，是和人民政府的关怀分不开的。去年自治区人民政府在达拉西村贷放了大批的粮食和农具。杜齐降错家缺少种籽，在政府贷给二百四十斤粮食后，他获得了好收成。阿卜家在政府帮助下，把丢荒了四五年的土地都全部种上了，他用去年剩余的六百斤洋芋换来了茶叶和盐巴。去年全村的田地都获得了丰收，加上他们帮助进藏部队驮运和出售柴草的收入，大家生活得很富裕了。现在，达拉西村的二十多家藏民已拥有四百六十多头牛、马和绵羊，全村播耕的面积由去年的三百多克增加到五百六十多克（克是藏族计量单位，约相当于三十五市斤，一克地就是能播种一克种籽的土地面积），地里正成长着一片茁壮的庄稼。
