    Reader Chen Xueqiu Suggests Local Newspapers and Periodicals
    Should Report More on Heroic Deeds in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
    Editor: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people, the massive Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is under active construction. Many leaders are personally directing operations on the embankment, and hundreds of thousands of laborers are working enthusiastically and selflessly on the construction site. Currently, the project is more than 70 percent complete. The project builders have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity, and countless heroic and exemplary deeds have emerged during the construction process. For example, Comrade Wang Xiancheng, an engineer at the South Sluice Gate Headquarters, adjusted the "rebar distribution," saving the country 78 tons of steel materials, equivalent to 780 million yuan in Renminbi. Comrade Xie Yong, head of the Supply Section of the North Sluice Gate Headquarters, invented a sand washing tool, which replaced manual stone washing and saved a large amount of manpower. Laborer Ling Guoying set a new record by carrying 232 loads of earth per day (equivalent to 27,840 jin).

    However, our newspapers and periodicals have reported very little about the significance of this project and the touching deeds in the project. This shows that our propaganda work is far behind our construction work. I suggest that local newspapers and periodicals organize a large number of journalists, writers, and participants in this project to report on the heroic and exemplary deeds in the project in a timely manner and spread them throughout the country to educate the broad masses of the people.

    读者陈雪球建议各地报刊
    应多报道荆江分洪工程中英雄事迹
    编辑同志：在共产党和人民政府领导下，在广大人民的热烈支援下，巨大的荆江分洪工程正在积极施工。很多首长亲自上堤指挥，几十万劳动大军热情地忘我地在工地上工作着。目前这个工程已完成百分之七十以上。工程建筑者发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，在施工过程中涌现了无数英雄模范事迹。如南闸指挥部工程师王咸成同志调整“钢筋分布”状况，为国家节省七十八吨钢筋器材，合人民币七、八亿元。北闸指挥部供给科长谢涌同志发明洗砂工具，用它来代替人工洗石，节省了大批人力。民工凌国英同志创造每天挑二百三十二担土
    （合二万七千八百四十斤）的新纪录，等等。
    但是，我们的报纸和刊物对这一工程的意义和工程中的感人事迹，却报道得极少，这说明我们的宣传工作还远远落在我们的建设工作的后面。我建议各地报纸、刊物组织大批新闻工作者、文艺工作者和参加这一工程的人员，及时地把工程中的英雄模范事迹报道出来，传播到全国各地去，以教育广大人民。
