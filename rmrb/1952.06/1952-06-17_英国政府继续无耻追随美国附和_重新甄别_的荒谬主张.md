Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th. Disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of the British people, the British government, on the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war that is hindering the conclusion of a Korean armistice agreement, continues to follow the United States step by step, repeatedly expressing its approval of the absurd claim of "re-screening" of our captured personnel. According to a United Press London dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons on the 11th in response to questioning: "The United Nations Command has proposed a re-screening after the armistice agreement, and Britain believes this proposal is fair."

After the U.S. side put forward the absurd plan to detain 100,000 of our captured personnel, Eden had already issued a shameless statement in the British House of Commons on May 7th, echoing the U.S. side's unreasonable demands. In his statement, Eden, like Ridgway, clamored: "This proposal has reached the limit of possible concessions." However, after U.S. General Colson confessed that the U.S. side's so-called "screening" was a synonym for persecution and massacre to forcibly detain our captured personnel, the U.S. plan's arrogance and unreasonableness were thoroughly exposed. People all over the world, including the British people, unanimously angrily condemned the U.S. side's criminal act of violating international conventions and forcibly "screening" prisoners of war. Under these circumstances, Eden immediately changed his tune according to the will of the United States, calling the "re-screening" proposed by the U.S. side "fair."

It is very clear that the British government has no will of its own and only acts as a mouthpiece for Washington. When the U.S. side violently violates the Geneva Convention, refuses to repatriate all prisoners of war, and carries out bloody massacres of our captured personnel who are unarmed and demand to be repatriated to their homeland, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lloyd brazenly said in the British House of Commons on May 19th: "The United Nations Command has always treated prisoners of war in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention" (British Information Services, London, May 19th). The British government completely parrots the U.S. tune, on the one hand, paying lip service to being a "follower" of the Geneva Convention, and on the other hand, praising the U.S. side's so-called "screening" and "re-screening" which thoroughly violates the Geneva Convention, and even sending its troops to Geoje Island to help the U.S. troops massacre our captured personnel.

### 英国政府继续无耻追随美国附和“重新甄别”的荒谬主张

    英国政府继续无耻追随美国附和“重新甄别”的荒谬主张
    【新华社开城十四日电】不顾广大英国人民的反对，英国政府在阻碍朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的遣返战俘问题上，依然步步追随着美国，一再表示赞成对我方被俘人员进行“重新甄别”的荒谬主张。据合众社伦敦消息，英国外交大臣艾登十一日在下议院答复质询时说：“联合国军司令部已经提出停战协议后重新进行甄别的建议，英国认为这建议是公道的。”
    在美方提出扣留我方十万被俘人员的荒谬方案以后，艾登就曾经在五月七日在英国下议院发表了一篇附和美方的无理主张的无耻声明，艾登在声明中和李奇微一样叫嚣着：“这个建议已到了可能让步的限度。”可是在美国将军柯尔生供认了美方的所谓“甄别”就是用迫害和屠杀强迫扣留我方被俘人员的代名词之后，美方方案的蛮横无理彻底暴露，全世界人民，包括英国人民在内，一致愤怒地声讨美方这种破坏国际公约，强迫“甄别”战俘的罪恶行为。在这种情况下，艾登就又按照美国的意旨，马上改口，把美方所提出来的“重新甄别”称做是“公道”的了。
    很显然，英国政府并没有自己的意志，只作了华盛顿的传声筒。当美方横暴地破坏日内瓦公约，拒绝遣返全部战俘，并且对手无寸铁的要求遣返祖国的我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀的时候，英国政府的外交副大臣劳埃德五月十九日就在英国下议院厚着脸皮说：“联合国军司令部始终按照一九四九年日内瓦协定对待战俘”（英国新闻处伦敦五月十九日电）。英国政府完全学着美国的腔调，一方面口口声声说自己是日内瓦公约的“遵守者”，一方面又极口称赞美方彻底破坏日内瓦公约的所谓“甄别”和“再甄别”，并且派了它的军队到巨济岛上去帮着美国军队屠杀我方被俘人员。
