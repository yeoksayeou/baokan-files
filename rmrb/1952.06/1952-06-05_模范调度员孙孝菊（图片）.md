	I. Sun Xiaoju, China's first female dispatcher, works in the dispatching section of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau in Northeast China. She humbly studies and adopts the advanced Soviet experience - the "Zagorko Dispatching Method," establishing a set of dispatching methods that "are familiar with the situation, rely on the masses, and proactively act as organizers and commanders."
	II. When she started doing dispatching work, she always remembered the Party's instructions to her: dispatchers are not just mere recorders, but also commanders and organizers in railway transportation. She also thought: Minister Teng Daiyuan often calls on us to learn from Soviet experience. So she borrowed a book about the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" and worked hard to study it.
	III. She discovered that the main spirit of the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" is: be familiar with the situation and master the situation; understand the masses and rely on the masses. She told her understanding to Zhu Yongxiang, the director of dispatching. But Zhu Yongxiang was noncommittal.
	IV. She then sought other dispatchers to study together. Dispatcher Zheng Baolin mocked her, saying, "You, a female comrade, just started dispatching work and you're already talking about advanced experience!"
	V. But Sun Xiaoju was not discouraged. According to the spirit of the "Zagorko Dispatching Method," she often went out to understand the situation. She paid close attention to the more than thirty stations she was in charge of, often talking to the working comrades at the stations during her time off, understanding the equipment capacity of the stations, and soliciting their opinions on dispatching work.
	VI. Sometimes, she proactively rode freight trains to understand the situation and problems in freight transportation, and discussed with the drivers how to maximize the traction capacity of the locomotives.
	VII. Once, dispatcher Zheng Baolin satirized her again: "We can still work without going out to understand the situation." She listened and was not angry. Instead, she said very modestly: "We who are engaged in dispatching work are like commanders in the army. How can we win battles if we don't understand the enemy's situation?" Due to her enlightenment, Zheng Baolin realized his mistake.
	VIII. After the higher authorities called on railway workers across the country to carry out the movement of full load, super axle, and five hundred kilometers, she analyzed the situation of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau and found that the slope between Xintun and Yi'an was the most difficult place to pull more train cars. She thought that if this difficulty could be broken through, "super axle" could be implemented. She personally ran to this area to investigate.
	IX. She knew that driver Ma Hongtao had a high level of political awareness and was not conservative, so she sought him to study how to pull more train cars in this area.
	X. Driver Ma Hongtao volunteered to accept the task of driving the locomotive here, pulling two thousand five hundred and fifty tons, and finally safely drove through this area, and ran four minutes faster. This powerfully broke the conservative thinking. Now the drivers can "super axle" in this area.
	XI. Because she can grasp the situation and rely on the masses, she has completed all the work plans she has made each time. None of the dispatching orders she issued have failed.
	XII. She deeply realized that no department of a railway enterprise can be isolated. Therefore, she universally signed contact contracts with stations and locomotive depots. This shortened the train's stay time and towed more goods. The Ministry of Railways and the National Committee of the Railway Trade Union called on dispatchers across the country to learn and promote her advanced working methods. (End)

    一、我国第一个女调度员孙孝菊，在东北齐齐哈尔铁路分局车务科做调度工作，她虚心钻研，并采用了苏联先进经验——“扎果尔科调度法”，建立了一套“熟悉情况，依靠群众，主动地做组织者和指挥者”的调度工作方法。
    二、她开始做调度工作，时刻想到党对她的指示：调度员并不是单纯的记录者，也是铁路运输中的指挥者和组织者。她又想：滕代远部长常常号召我们好好学习苏联经验。她于是借了一本讲“扎果尔科调度法”的书，努力学习它。
    三、她发现了“扎果尔科调度法”的主要精神是：熟悉情况，掌握情况；了解群众，依靠群众。她把自己的体会告诉了调度主任祝永祥。但祝永祥不置可否。
    四、她又找其他调度员来共同研究。调度员郑宝林讥讽她说：“你这个女同志，刚干调度工作，就谈起什么先进经验来了！”
    五、但孙孝菊没有灰心。她根据“扎果尔科调度法”的精神，常常到外面去了解情况。她对自己所掌握的三十多个车站，都非常注意，常常在休班时到车站上跟工作同志谈话，了解车站的设备能力，并征询他们对调度工作的意见。
    六、有时候，她主动地乘坐货车，了解货车运输中的情况和问题，并跟司机们讨论如何发挥机车的牵引能力。
    七、有一次，调度员郑宝林又讽刺她：“我们不出去了解情况，也一样能工作。”她听了，并不生气，反而很谦虚地说：“我们干调度工作的，如同军队的指挥员一样，不了解敌情，怎能打胜仗呢？”由于她的启发，郑宝林认识了自己的错误。
    八、在上级号召全国铁路职工开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动以后，她分析了齐齐哈尔铁路分局的情况，发现从新屯到衣安之间的坡道是个最不容易多拉车皮的地方。她想，如果突破了这道难关，“超轴”就能实行了。她亲自跑到这个地区去察看。
    九、她知道司机马洪滔的政治觉悟高，不保守，她就找他研究怎样在这个地区多拉车皮。
    十、司机马洪滔自愿授受了在这里驾驶机车的任务，牵引了二千五百五十吨，终于很安全地驶过了这个地区，而且快跑了四分钟。这就有力地打破了保守思想。现在司机们都能在这个地区“超轴”了。
    十一、因为能掌握情况，依靠群众，她每次订的工作计划都全部完成了。她发出的任何一个调度命令都没有落空。
    十二、她深刻地体会到铁路企业的任何部门都是不能孤立的。于是，她普遍地和车站、机务段订立了联系合同。这样就缩短了列车的停留时间，多牵引了货物。铁道部和铁路工会全国委员会号召全国调度工作者学习并推广她的先进工作方法。（完）
