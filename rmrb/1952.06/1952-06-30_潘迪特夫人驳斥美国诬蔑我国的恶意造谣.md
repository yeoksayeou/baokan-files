Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: According to a New Delhi dispatch from the Indian Information Service: Mrs. Pandit, head of the Indian cultural delegation that recently visited our country, issued a statement on the 26th refuting the "conversations, supposedly from some members of the Indian cultural delegation who recently visited China," published in some Indian and foreign newspapers, and condemning "many of these conversations are published anonymously, and the content is incorrect and easily gives a wrong impression."
    As is well known, the visit of the Chinese cultural delegation to India and the visit of the Indian cultural delegation to China have laid a good foundation for the development and consolidation of friendship between the peoples of China and India. This has obviously greatly alarmed the American imperialists, who are trying to undermine the unity of the Asian people, especially the unity between the peoples of China and India, the two major countries. Therefore, the United States Information Service, the official propaganda organ of the United States, as well as the Associated Press of the United States and the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of the American ruling group, have successively fabricated many rumors slandering New China in the name of members of the Indian cultural delegation who were unwilling to disclose their names, in an attempt to undermine the growing friendship between the peoples of China and India. For example, a New Delhi dispatch from the Associated Press on the 14th falsely claimed that "delegation members" who "asked reporters not to publish their names" said that "delegation members were under strict surveillance from the time they arrived in China until they left," and also said that there were many troops stationed along the parade route in Beijing's "May Day" parade to prevent "possible riots." The "New York Times" on June 8th even openly spread rumors that Mrs. Pandit said that the two million people building the Huai River dam "had no wages," and the "New York Times" said that "Mrs. Pandit was very uneasy when she learned of this." The United States Information Service also rebroadcast the absurd news published by the "New York Times."
    In her statement, Mrs. Pandit condemned these messages as "incorrect in content." She refuted the lies about delegation members being under "strict surveillance," saying, "The reason why some translators were assigned to the delegation is very obvious. Chinese courtesy has always been world-renowned. ... It was necessary to bring translators with us when we went out - whether for recreation, shopping or anything else - because none of us understood Chinese." Regarding the "New York Times" rumors, she said, "Some statements say that the people were conscripted for 'forced labor' to build the Huai River dam. As far as we know, there was no 'forced labor.' It is well known that the Huai River dam was built by the voluntary cooperation of about two million farmers, who received rice calculated by weight as wages." Mrs. Pandit refuted the news that a large number of troops were stationed during the "May Day" parade to "prevent riots," saying that this was "inconsistent with the facts." She said: "There were no troops deployed anywhere for the aforementioned purpose. The discipline and order of the parade was extremely good, and it was an extremely spectacular parade. Only a large number of non-military personnel participated in this parade." Mrs. Pandit finally said: "The delegation's overall impression is admiration for the enthusiasm and cultivated energy of the Chinese people in dealing with the difficult tasks facing them, as well as the great achievements they have achieved."
    The publication of Mrs. Pandit's statement shows that those who hate the Chinese people and try to undermine the growing friendship and unity between the peoples of China and India have once again gone bankrupt this time.

    潘迪特夫人驳斥美国诬蔑我国的恶意造谣
    【新华社二十九日讯】据印度新闻处新德里消息：不久以前访问我国的印度文化代表团团长潘迪特夫人在二十六日发表了一项声明，驳斥印度和外国一些报纸刊载的“据说是最近访问过中国的印度文化代表团一些团员的谈话”，谴责“这些谈话有许多是匿名发表的，内容不正确，很容易给人错误的印象。”
    如所周知，中国文化代表团之访问印度和印度文化代表团之访问中国，给中印两国人民间友谊的发展与巩固，奠定了良好的基础。这显然使极力想破坏亚洲人民的团结，特别是中印两大国人民之间的团结的美帝国主义者大为恐慌。于是，美国的官方宣传机关美国新闻处，以及美国的美联社和美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约时报”，就先后以不愿发表姓名的印度文化代表团团员的名义，拙劣地制造了许多诬蔑新中国的消息，力图破坏中印两国人民之间日益增长的友谊。例如，美联社新德里十四日电造谣说，“要求记者不要发表他们姓名”的“代表团人员”说，“代表团团员从到达中国的时候起直到离开的时候为止一直受到严格的监视”，还说在北京的“五一”节游行中有许多军队在游行路线上站岗，以防备“可能的暴动”。六月八日的“纽约时报”更公然造谣说：潘迪特夫人说修建淮河水闸的二百万人“并无工资”，“纽约时报”并说“当潘迪特夫人知道这一点时，很是不安。”美国新闻处也把“纽约时报”所刊载的荒谬消息加以转播。
    潘迪特夫人在声明中斥责这些消息是“内容不正确”的。她驳斥关于代表团团员受到“严格的监视”的谎话说：“一些译员被派到代表团来的原因是很明显的。中国人的礼貌原是举世闻名的。……我们外出时——不管是游玩、买东西或者做其他任何事情——带译员一道是必要的，因为我们谁也不懂中国话。”对于“纽约时报”的造谣，她说：“有些声明说老百姓被征去进行‘强迫劳动’，建筑淮河水闸。就我们所知，没有‘强迫劳动’的事。大家知道得很清楚，淮河水闸是在两百万左右农民自愿合作下筑成的，这些农民得到按斤计算的大米作为工资。”潘迪特夫人驳斥关于“五一”节游行时有大量军队站岗“防止暴动”的消息说，这是“不符合事实的”，她说：“任何地方都没有为上述目的而布置军队。游行的纪律和秩序极好，是一次极其壮观的游行，参加这次游行的只有许许多多的非军人。”潘迪特夫人最后说：“代表团的总的印象是钦佩中国人民应付他们面前的困难任务的热忱和培养出来的精力，以及他们所得到的巨大成绩。”
    潘迪特夫人声明的发表，说明那些仇视中国人民并力图破坏中印两国人民之间的日益增强的友谊和团结的人，这一次是又告破产了。
