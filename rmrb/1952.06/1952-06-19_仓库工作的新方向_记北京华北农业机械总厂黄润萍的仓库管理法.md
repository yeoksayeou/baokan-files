    A New Direction for Warehouse Work
    ——On Huang Runping's Warehouse Management Method at the Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Ren Zhiqiao
    In the upcoming large-scale production increase and economy movement, how can warehouse work ensure coordination with production and complete tasks? This is a very important question. In this regard, the warehouse management method created by Huang Runping, deputy section chief of the warehouse at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in Beijing, provides a new direction.
    What is the task of a warehouse? The old convention was: receiving, issuing, and storing. What was the old working method of the warehouse? The old answer was: when you deliver goods, I receive them; when you need materials, I issue them. However, Huang Runping broke this convention and overturned the old answer. In his practical work, he developed and enriched the content of warehouse work and created a new warehouse management method. The biggest feature of this method is shifting from passive to active, and actively serving production. Now, the warehouse of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has taken on a new look because of the implementation of this method. The workers all say, "Our Director Huang has turned the warehouse from 'dead' to 'alive'."
    In mid-February, when Huang Runping was newly promoted from the lathe workshop to the warehouse as deputy section chief, he lacked confidence and felt somewhat discouraged. He thought, "The warehouse is a mess, the materials are disorganized, and the accounts are chaotic. My own education level is low, and my ability is not good. How can I manage the warehouse well?" He couldn't sleep at night. Later, he felt that this way of thinking was not right, "Can't our working class even manage a warehouse? Besides, I am still a member of the Communist Youth League, and I was also the deputy leader of a model group in the lathe workshop. I must not be overwhelmed by difficulties." He also remembered the words of the Party General Branch Secretary: "As long as we rely on the masses and study hard, difficulties can be overcome." The workers in the lathe workshop also encouraged him in various ways: "Runping: Go for it! Show the same energy as our past model group, and the warehouse will definitely be managed well." Thinking of these things, Huang Runping's confidence gradually became firm.
    Newly promoted worker-cadres can quickly become familiar with the business as long as they are willing to study hard. Huang Runping was like this. He first moved from home to live in the warehouse, working alongside everyone. When materials came in from outside, he followed the administrators to learn how to inspect them. When he didn't understand something, he humbly asked comrades who were familiar with the business. Once, a master craftsman from the carpentry workshop came to collect drill bits. Coincidentally, the comrade in charge of storing the drill bits was not there, so Huang Runping casually issued a batch. Later, after checking, he realized that he had issued the wrong ones. The carpentry workshop's work was not hard, so water steel drill bits were enough, but what was issued was a batch of high-speed steel drill bits, and the price difference was several times. He thought, "If a person can carry two hundred pounds, but is only asked to carry twenty pounds, isn't that a waste of talent?" In the evening, he made a self-criticism at the group meeting. The warehouse was taking inventory of materials and needed to establish new accounts. However, Huang Runping didn't know how to establish them, so he went to the accounting office to ask for advice. After several studies, the new accounts were established.
    All work should not be done "dogmatically," but should be constantly developed and improved. Huang Runping deeply realized this point. Once, the supply and marketing section bought one hundred and twenty catties of imported nails, while the warehouse still had three hundred and forty catties in stock. He thought, "This is a backlog of funds! The workshop's purchase requisition forms really can't be approved without checking with the warehouse!" He actively discussed it with the supply and marketing section, and agreed that if the warehouse had enough stock, they would resolutely not buy more. Another time, the spheroidal graphite cast iron research office requisitioned small kindling wood, requiring two hundred kilograms per month. However, the warehouse was piled up with a large number of waste wood. He felt that this money should have been saved long ago. He mobilized two workers from the coke warehouse to chop wood. In this way, two to three thousand catties of kindling wood could be purchased less per year. Huang Runping began to feel that the warehouse should not only do some receiving and issuing work, but should actively coordinate with production. Therefore, he was determined to gradually change this passive situation in his work.
    In a factory, the basic unit of production is the workshop. To do a good job in warehouse work, you must first face the workshop, actively coordinate with the workshop to complete the production tasks, and make each material and tool fully play its due role. This is the experience Huang Runping has gained from practice, and it is also the most basic feature of his new warehouse work method.
    Timely understanding of production conditions, grasping the material usage schedule, and paying attention to saving national wealth anytime and anywhere is the first content of facing the workshop. In the past, some workshops often requisitioned too much material. For example, once, the leader of the screw lathe group in the lathe workshop came to requisition four round files. In fact, they only needed one, but the higher-ups had already approved it, so according to the old rules, it had to be given. After Huang Runping mobilized and persuaded them, they only took one, and gave an extra one for standby, thus saving the other two round files. (Note) In the past, when requisitioning materials, the comrades in the workshop often asked to take them all back at once for convenience. Now, the warehouse issues them in batches according to production needs and inventory conditions. They generally divide them into periods of one month, half a month, ten days, or one week. In this way, it neither delays production nor wastes national wealth. Some workshops usually do not pay attention to conservation, always thinking that there are good goods in the warehouse, and they go to get them when they are damaged. The casting workshop's No. 1 pig iron furnace had to requisition a steel wire rope every month. Huang Runping felt very strange: "This kind of material is very strong, why does it break so quickly?" He went to the workshop with the production section chief and the supply and marketing section chief to find out. It turned out that the comrades in the workshop did not pay much attention to protection, and the wheel was uneven, and the steel rope was wound in a messy way. In this way, the steel rope was prone to fluffing and did not last long. After research and improvement, one steel wire rope can be used for five or six months or even a year, which saves several tens of millions of yuan. In the strict implementation of economy, some ideological obstacles were encountered. For example, some comrades within the warehouse held a negative attitude: "Use less to requisition more, use inferior to requisition good, it is your waste, my responsibility is to follow orders." Some comrades in individual workshops were also dissatisfied with this "nosy" behavior, some said: "The higher-ups have approved it, you have no second say, you have to give it." Some people even said to him: "A dog biting a mouse, meddling in other people's business." Huang Runping always patiently reasoned with them, and soon these comrades were persuaded.
    Paying attention to conservation on the one hand, and actively meeting the needs of production on the other, is the second content of facing the workshop. For example, the warehouse had a kind of ball bearing cage, which was not distinguished between good and bad in the past. Often the ones that needed good ones were issued bad ones, which affected the life of the machine. Now they have studied that the lathe workshop's ground shaft needs to drive more than twenty screw lathes, so it must use good ball bearing cages; the material truck in the casting workshop can also use slightly inferior ball bearing cages. The comrades in the warehouse actively guarantee the supply for all determined material usage plans. Once, the steel files planned by the carpentry workshop were not collected on time, so Wang Benli, who was in charge of tools in the warehouse, took the initiative to notify the workshop to collect them in time to avoid hindering production. In the past, the coke in the warehouse was not sorted by size. In this way, the workers in the workshop were very distressed because they could not get the large pieces when they needed them; instead, they got large pieces when they needed medium pieces, and they had to break them before they could use them. Now Huang Runping took the initiative to divide the coke into four grades: large, medium, small, and fine powder. The No. 2 melting furnace in the casting workshop must use large pieces, so they are given large pieces; the No. 5 furnace needs medium pieces, so they are given medium pieces; the blacksmith's forge in the forging workshop can use some small pieces. After this classification, each workshop can get the coke they need.
    In order to promote capital turnover and solve the problem of backlog, promoting the use of substitutes and recycled products to the workshop is the third content of facing the workshop. In the past, the warehouse had a large backlog of materials and tools, and the workers in the workshop often only wanted new ones and not old ones, large ones and not small ones, good ones and not inferior ones. For example, the warehouse was piled up with more than two hundred tons of various waste steel materials. Some thin iron sheets were not easy to melt, and the scrap rate was high. In addition, new materials were constantly coming in, so the casting workshop was unwilling to use the old ones. After active research and mobilization by the comrades in the warehouse, a part of the old materials was mixed in when new materials were issued, thus promoting the use of most of the waste steel materials. In the past, there was a "waste product warehouse" in the factory, and everyone thought that it was really a pile of waste products, and no one cared about it at all. Huang Runping paid great attention to it. After analysis and research, most of it could still be processed and utilized. Once, three workshops sent three broken pliers that could no longer be used one after another. The comrades in the warehouse disassembled the good parts and put them together to make a usable pair of pliers, and sent them to the workshop for use. For example, many waste grinding wheels were stored in the "waste product warehouse" and could no longer be used to grind things. The comrades in the warehouse broke them up and used them to replace a part of the emery to make plowshares. In this way, 60% of the emery demand can be solved, and according to the annual task calculation, about 200 million yuan can be saved. This turned the "waste product warehouse" around, and all the comrades in the warehouse agreed to rename it the "recycled product warehouse."
    Unified leadership of the tool rooms in each workshop, and implementation of necessary allocation and exchange of tools is the fourth content of facing the workshop. In the past, the tool room and the warehouse only had a receiving and issuing relationship. Now, the tool rooms in the entire factory belong to the workshops on the one hand, and are uniformly led by the warehouse on the other hand. In this way, in terms of tools, they can better serve the workshops. They transfer the tools that are temporarily not needed in this workshop to another workshop that urgently needs them. This kind of tool exchange can reduce the warehouse's expenses. For example, once, the casting workshop came to requisition new hammers, while the machine workshop had two hammers idle. Huang Runping obtained the consent of the machine workshop and transferred them. The comrades in the warehouse learned that the lathe workshop could only use grinding wheels of ten inches or more. When they were ground to eight inches, the tool could not reach in. According to past habits, this would become a waste product and be thrown aside. However, the pig iron furnace in the casting workshop requisitioned grinding wheels of about eight inches from the warehouse. Therefore, they exchanged the so-called "waste product" grinding wheels left over from the lathe workshop. Since the unified tool room for two months, fourteen old grinding wheels have been exchanged, saving the warehouse the expense of new grinding wheels.
    Inviting veteran workers from the workshop to explain certain material specifications and properties and help with material inspection is the fifth content of facing the workshop. There are too many types of materials used in production, and 70% of the comrades in the warehouse were newly transferred, so it is impossible for them to be proficient in every material. They asked the workshop workers for help. For example, some comrades did not understand the quality of files, so they asked Yu Deshui, a worker in the lathe workshop, to explain. Now, for any material that the warehouse administrator is not familiar with, they ask the worker from the workshop that needs it to help with the inspection. At the end of April, thirty kilograms of water glue were purchased, and the comrades in the warehouse did not know much about it, so they asked Li Yushu, a technical worker from the model group in the casting workshop, to help. In this way, the workers are very satisfied, and they say, "This method is good, it saves us from using bad materials!"
    In order to ensure the realization of the above-mentioned facing the workshop and coordinating with production, the warehouse itself needs to formulate some practical and feasible systems. In the past, the warehouse work of this factory was very chaotic. The management was all-encompassing, the division of labor among employees was not detailed, and the responsibility was not clear, so that embezzlers had opportunities to take advantage of, and it was difficult for the warehouse management work to become regularized. According to work needs and material classification, Huang Runping established seven branch warehouses and groups, which are the four branch warehouses of casting and forging, carpentry, recycled products, and finished products, and the three groups of metal finished products, tools, and other materials. In this way, everyone familiarizes themselves with their own business and establishes a strict responsibility system. For example, a part of the warehouse's iron and steel and fuel is mainly supplied to the casting workshop and the forging workshop. According to this need, the warehouse draws two comrades to organize a casting and forging branch warehouse, mainly serving the casting and forging workshops. After the division of labor becomes specialized, everyone's enthusiasm is also brought into play. In the past, the iron materials in the warehouse rusted and the medicines underwent chemical changes. Some people always thought, "That is a natural phenomenon, and human power cannot be reversed." Now, under the leadership of Huang Runping, all the employees in the warehouse treat national property like they treat their own eyes. For example, they found that the wooden boards of the material racks had moisture, which easily caused the iron materials to rust, so they immediately used a part of the oil felt to pad them up one by one. Huang Runping often said to everyone, "Our warehouse is a treasury, and not a single material can be lost. Everyone think about it, if a waste product is produced in the workshop, the workers will have to feel sorry for it for a long time!" In the internal inspection system of the warehouse, in addition to timely inventory of the stock quantity to have a clear understanding, they also proposed six preventions: fire prevention, theft prevention, spy prevention, moisture prevention, corrosion prevention, and rust prevention. In this way, there is a clear goal during monthly inspections.
    In order to do a good job in warehouse work, it is necessary to actively establish necessary contact systems with the outside. Once, Huang Runping went to the supply and marketing section for something, and happened to meet Zhang Fengquan, the head of the supply and marketing section, who was arranging work, asking a purchasing agent to transport four hundred tons of cement in three days. Huang Runping thought in his heart: "It's terrible! There is no place in the warehouse yet! If the goods arrive at the door, it will be a real disaster." At that time, he discussed with Zhang Fengquan and established a contact system of "advance notice of incoming goods." In the future, for all large batches of incoming materials, the warehouse must be notified three days in advance to prepare, so as to avoid being caught in a passive position.
    Although the factory leadership has paid attention to Huang Runping's creative working methods, they have not given enough attention and support. For example, some leading comrades have expressed doubts about the new warehouse management method, saying, "Warehouse work is just receiving, issuing, and storing. Is Huang Runping exceeding his scope of work?" Some individuals even said, "He has neither a high level of education nor experience in warehouse work, so what new things can he create!" But now, the warehouse of this factory has been completely changed, and a new lively atmosphere has emerged. The living facts have forced those with conservative ideas to change their views and begin to pay attention.
    Although Huang Runping's warehouse management method is still very short, the experience is not mature, and there are still some shortcomings in the work. However, a basic achievement can be affirmed, that is, it has opened up a new direction for warehouse work.
    Note: In the past, the factory's material usage plan was controlled by the production section, but now it has been changed to be controlled by the warehouse.

    仓库工作的新方向
    ——记北京华北农业机械总厂黄润萍的仓库管理法
    新华社记者  任志樵
    在即将到来的大规模增产节约运动中，仓库工作如何保证配合生产，完成任务，是个很重要的问题。在这一方面，华北农业机械总厂仓库副股长黄润萍所创造的仓库管理法，提供了一个新的方向。
    仓库的任务是什么呢？旧的陈规是：收、发和保管。仓库的工作方法是什么呢？旧的答案是：你来货，我就收；你领料，我照发。黄润萍却打破了这个陈规，推翻了旧答案。他在实际工作中，发展和丰富了仓库工作的内容，创造了新的仓库管理法。这个方法最大的特点是由被动转入主动，积极地为生产服务。现在，华北农业机械总厂的仓库，因为实行了这个方法而出现了崭新的面貌。工人们都说：“咱们黄主管，把仓库由‘死’的管成‘活’的了。”
    二月中旬，黄润萍刚从车工场提拔到仓库当副股长的时候，信心不足，有些自馁情绪。他想：“仓库是个杂摊子，材料乱，账没头。自己的文化程度又低，能力又不行。这怎么能把仓库管理好呢？”晚上他总是睡不着觉。后来，他觉得这样想不对头，“难道咱们工人阶级连个仓库也没本事管吗？再说，自己还是个青年团员，在车工场还是模范小组的副组长，绝不能让困难给压倒了。”他又记起党总支书记嘱咐的话：“只要依靠群众，努力学习，困难是可以克服的。”车工场的工人又多方鼓励：“润萍：干吧！拿出咱们过去模范小组的劲头来，仓库一定能管好。”想到这些，黄润萍的信心便逐渐地坚定起来了。
    新提拔的工人干部，只要肯努力学习，业务是会很快熟悉的。黄润萍就是这样。他先从家里搬到仓库来住，跟着大伙一块干活。外边来料，他跟着管理员去学验收。有不懂的地方，虚心向熟习业务的同志学习。有一次，木工场老师傅来领钻头，凑巧那个负责保管钻头的同志不在，黄润萍就顺手发了一把。后来一查，才知道发错了。木工场的活不硬，水钢钻头就行了，而发出的却是一把锋钢的钻头，价钱相差好几倍。他想：“一个人能担二百斤，只给担二十斤，那不是大材小用吗？”晚上，他在小组会上进行了检讨。仓库清点材料，要立新账，可是，黄润萍不懂怎么立法，便去会计室请教，经过几次的学习，新账就建立起来了。
    一切工作不能“墨守成规”地做下去，而应该不断地发展和提高。黄润萍深深体会到这一点。有一次，供销股买来了一百二十斤洋钉子，而仓库里还存了三百四十斤。他想：“这就是积压资金呀！车间请购单，不经过仓库看看可真不行呢！”他主动地和供销股商量好，凡是仓库存料够用，就坚决不买。又有一次，球墨铸铁研究室请购小劈材，每个月要二百公斤。可是仓库里却堆着大批的废木材，他觉得这笔钱早就该省了。他发动焦炭库的两个工人劈材，这样，一年就能少买两三千斤劈材。黄润萍开始感到仓库不应只做些收收发发的工作，而应该主动地配合生产。于是，他决心在工作中，逐步地转变这种被动的形势。
    在一个工厂里，生产的基本单位是车间。要把仓库工作做好，就得首先面向车间，主动地配合车间完成生产任务，使得每种材料和工具充分发挥它应有的作用。这是黄润萍从实践中摸出来的经验，也是他的新仓库工作法最基本的一个特点。
    及时了解生产情况，掌握用料进度计划，随时随地注意节省国家财富，这是面向车间的第一个内容。过去有些车间领料时，往往多领。比如有一次，车工场螺丝床小组长来领四把圆锉，实际上他们只需要一把，可是上级已经批下来了，按旧规矩就得给，经黄润萍动员说服后，只领一把，另外多给一把备用，这就把另外两把圆锉省下来。（注）过去领料，车间的同志常常要求一次领回去，用起来方便。现在的仓库却根据生产需要和库存情况，分期发给，他们一般地分一月、半月、一旬或一周等期。这样，既不耽误生产，又能节约国家财富。有些车间平时不注意节约，总以为仓库里有好货，坏了就去领。铸工场一号马钢炉，每月要领一根钢丝绳。黄润萍就感到很奇怪：“这种料，很结实，为啥坏得这样快？”他便和生产科长和供销股长一块到车间去了解，原来是车间同志不大注意保护，那个轮子不平，钢绳乱绕，这样，钢绳就容易起毛，用不长久。经过研究改进，一根钢丝绳，能用五、六个月甚至一年，这就节省了好几千万元。在厉行节约当中，曾碰到过一些思想障碍。如仓库内部的个别同志，抱着消极态度：“用少要多，用次要好，是你浪费，我的责任是照令办事。”个别车间里的同志，也不满意这种“多事”，有的说：“上级批准了，你没二话说，就得给。”甚至有人说他：“狗咬耗子，多管闲事。”而黄润萍总是耐心地讲道理，不久，这些同志也都被说服了。
    一方面注意节约，同时要主动地满足生产上需要，这是面向车间的第二个内容。比如仓库有一种球架，过去是好坏不分的，常常需要好的，结果发了坏的，以致影响机器的寿命。现在他们研究，车工场地轴，要带动二十几盘螺丝床，必须用好球架；铸工场上料车次一点的球架也能使。凡是确定了的用料计划，仓库里同志积极保证供应。有一次，木工场所计划的钢锉到期没来领，仓库管工具的汪本立，便主动地通知车间，要他们及时地领回去，以免妨碍生产。过去仓库里的焦炭，大小不分。这样，车间工人很伤脑筋，要大块的领不到；要中块的反而领来了大块的，还得砸碎了才能用。现在黄润萍就主动地把焦炭分成大、中、小和细末四等。铸工场二号化铁炉，一定要用大块就给大块；五号炉需用中块的就给中块；锻工场打铁炉可以用一部分小块。这样分类以后，各个车间都可以领到自己所需用的焦炭。
    为了促进资金周转，解决积压问题，向车间推用代用品和再制品，是面向车间的第三个内容。过去仓库积压了大批的材料和工具，而车间工人往往是有新不用旧，有大不用小，有好不用次。如仓库里堆着各种废钢料二百多吨，有些薄铁片，不易溶化，报废率又大，加上又不断来新料，铸工场就不愿意要旧的。经过仓库同志积极地研究和动员，发新料时掺一部分旧料，就这样把废钢料，推用了一大部分。过去厂里有一个“废品库”，都认为里边堆着的真是废品，根本没有人去管它。黄润萍却非常注意。经过分析和研究，大部分还可以加工利用。有一次，三个车间先后送来了三把不能再用的坏钳子，仓库里的同志，把好零件拆下来，再凑成一把能用的钳子，又发给车间去用。又如“废品库”里存了许多废砂轮，不能再磨东西，仓库里的同志将它砸碎了，去代替一部分金钢砂打犁镜，这样，能解决金钢砂需要量的百分之六十，按全年任务计算，可节约两亿元左右。这就把“废品库”翻了一个身，全库的同志都同意把它更名为“再制品库”。
    统一领导各车间工具室，在工具上实行必要的调拨和交流，这是面向车间的第四个内容。过去工具室和仓库只有领发的关系，现在，全厂的工具室一方面是属于车间的，同时又统一由仓库来领导，这样，在工具方面，就能更好地为车间服务。他们把这个车间暂不需要的工具调到急需要的另一车间去，这种工具交流，可以减少仓库的支拨。如有一次，铸工场来领新榔头，而机工场却有两把榔头闲着，黄润萍便征得机工场同意把它调过去。仓库里的同志了解到车工场只能用十吋以上的砂轮，磨到八吋，刀就伸不进去。按过去习惯，这便成为废品，扔到一边。而铸工场的马钢炉，却向仓库领用八吋左右的砂轮，于是，他们就把车工场剩下所谓“废品”砂轮交流过来。自从统一工具室的两个月来，已交流旧砂轮十四个，省去了仓库支拨新砂轮。
    聘请车间老工人讲解某些材料规格、性能，并帮助验收材料，这是面向车间的第五个内容。生产上用料的种类太多，加上仓库的同志百分之七十是新调来的，不可能对每项材料都很精通，他们就请车间工人帮助。比如有些同志不懂锉刀好坏，便请车工场工人于德水来讲解。现在，凡是仓库管理员不熟悉的材料，那个车间要的，就请那个车间工人来帮助验收。四月底，买了三十公斤水胶，仓库同志都不大懂，便找铸工场模型组技术工人李玉书来帮忙。这样，工人都很满意，他们说：“这办法好，省住我们用坏料！”
    为了保证实现上面所说的面向车间，配合生产，仓库本身就需要制订一些切实可行的制度。过去这个厂的仓库工作是很混乱的。管理上是一揽子，职工中分工不细密，责任不明确，以致贪污分子有机可乘，并使仓库管理工作很难走上正规。黄润萍根据工作需要和材料分类，建立了七个分库和小组，这就是铸锻、木工、再制品和成品四个分库，金属成品、工具和其他材料等三个组。这样，大家分头熟悉本身业务，树立严格的责任制度。比如仓库中有一部钢铁、燃料，主要是供给铸工场和锻工场用的，根据这个需要，仓库里便抽出两个同志，组织一个铸锻分库，主要为铸、锻两车间服务。分工专业化以后，大家积极性也发挥起来，过去仓库里铁料生锈，药品起化学变化，有些人总认为：“那是自然现象，人力不能挽回。”而现在全库的职工在黄润萍的领导下，像爱护自己眼睛一样地对待国家财产。比如他们发现料架的木板有水分，容易使铁料生锈，便马上用一部分油毡一格格地垫起来。黄润萍常向大家讲：“咱们仓库就是金库，一点材料也不能损失。大家想想，车间里要是出了一个废品，工人们都得心疼半天哩！”在仓库内部的检查制度上，他们除掉及时盘查库存数量，做到心中有数外，并提出六防：防火、防盗、防特务、防潮、防腐和防锈。这样，在每月检查时，便有明确的目标。
    为了做好仓库工作，必须主动地和外边建立必要的联系制度。有一次，黄润萍去找供销股有事，刚好碰到供销股长张凤泉在布置工作，要一个采购员将四百吨洋灰，在三天内运到。黄润萍心里想：“糟啦！仓库里还没有地方哩！要是货到门口，那可真抓瞎了。”当时，他就和张凤泉研究，建立了“来货事先通知”的联系制度，以后，凡是大批进料，必须三天前通知仓库做准备，免得陷于被动。
    对于黄润萍这种创造性的工作方法，该厂领导方面虽然注意了，但并没有引起足够的重视和支持。比如有些领导同志曾对新的仓库管理法表示怀疑说：“仓库工作就是收发保管，黄润萍是不是超越了他的工作范围啦？”甚至有个别的人说：“他文化程度既不高，又没有仓库工作经验，还能创造出什么新东西来！”可是现在，这个厂的仓库完全改观了，出现了生龙活虎的新气象。活生生的事实，使得有保守思想的人不得不转变他们的看法，开始重视起来了。
    黄润萍的仓库管理方法，虽然时间还很短，经验还不成熟，工作中还有某些缺点。但是，有一个基本成绩可以肯定，那就是给仓库工作开辟了一个新的方向。
    注：该厂过去是由生产科来掌握用料计划，现在改由仓库掌握。
