    Day of Defending Peace
    Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, June 25th
    Today is the second anniversary of the Korean people's war of liberation against the armed intervention of the American imperialists. The heroic struggle of the Korean people against the American interventionist forces has won the sympathy of all peace-loving people around the world. Korea has become the banner of the liberation movement of oppressed countries and dependencies. The Soviet people and all progressive humanity extend fraternal greetings to the heroic Korean people who are fighting against foreign aggressors and heroically defending their freedom and independence.
    Working people of all countries and millions upon millions of peace supporters commemorate June 25th, treating this day as the international day of active solidarity with the heroic Korean people, as the day of defending peace, to show their love for the Korean people.
    The entire history of the past half-century has shown that imperialists cannot survive without violence and plunder, without blood and war. American imperialists are the destroyers of international peace after the Second World War. The American government, shifting from a policy of preparing for aggression to directly carrying out aggression, embarked on the path of armed intervention in Korea.
    The American aggressive bloc undermined peace in the Far East. They organized the aggression against Korea, aiming not only to control South Korea but also to control North Korea. They were determined to deprive Korea of its national independence, prevent Korea from becoming a unified and democratic country, and forcibly establish a reactionary, anti-people regime in Korea, so that the American ruling clique could turn Korea into their colony and use Korean territory as their military strategic springboard in the Far East.
    The American army invaded Korea under the banner of the United Nations and started a cruel war of destruction, plunging Korea into terrible disasters and suffering. The American aggressors are massively using the most inhumane and barbaric means of warfare in Korea. Their planes destroy non-military and undefended targets, such as homes, schools, hospitals, and temples, attempting to turn the entire Korea into a "deserted area." American aggressors have slaughtered hundreds of thousands of women, children, and the elderly in Korea.
    The American army has also openly and shamelessly violated universally recognized international law and international practice, and has massively used heinous bacteriological weapons, poison gas, and napalm bombs in Korea.
    The towering crimes of the American interventionists in Korea, the bacteriological warfare they launched, and the abuse and slaughter of prisoners of war on Geoje Island—the island of death—have greatly shocked the world and enraged the people of the world. Now, everyone can see that the American army is following in the footsteps of the Hitler's tyrannical regime, a bloody robber.
    The perfidious attack of the American interventionists has been met with resolute resistance from the Korean people, who, under the leadership of their Workers' Party and People's Government, have risen up to wage a heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The lofty ideal of defending freedom and national independence inspires Korean patriots and enables them to create a large number of heroic deeds in labor and combat. The glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, working shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people, are fighting against the American aggressors, giving fraternal assistance to the Korean people, and helping them defend their just cause.
    The failure of the American imperialist's aggressive plan convincingly proves that the imperialist gamble on the peace-loving Korean people is hopeless. The Korean people have tasted the joy of freedom; they will never be enslaved again. The American imperialists have not been able to enslave them in the past, and they will not be able to enslave them in the future.
    The war waged by the American aggressors in Korea clearly proves the imperialist aggressive policy that the American ruling clique has consistently pursued in the post-war period. The American and British imperialists themselves admit that they regard the intervention in Korea as a "rehearsal" for a future world war.
    The American imperialists are inciting war mania, stepping up the expansion of armaments, and preparing for a new world war. For this purpose, they are piecing together military aggressive blocs and establishing many military bases on foreign territories. For the same purpose, they have also concluded a military agreement with the revanchists of West Germany and are reviving the fascist hotbed of aggression in Europe in West Germany. The American imperialists are also reviving Japanese militarism, striving to turn the revived Japanese army into a shock force in their army for aggression against the Asian people.
    The entire course of events proves that the American ruling clique does not want peace, they fear peace, and they fear the peaceful cooperation of all countries, because this would hinder their crazy plan to seek world hegemony. They see war as a way to get rich. Since the outbreak of the Korean War, American monopoly capital has made a profit of about 90 billion US dollars. Because war and human blood have brought them huge profits, the American aggressors not only obstruct the elimination of the existing hotbed of war in the Far East, but also clamor to expand the war to other countries and peoples. The American aggressors are trying to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations that began last year as a result of the Soviet Union's peaceful proposals.
    The people of all countries do not need war. They are increasingly opposing the conspiracies of the imperialist war-mongers, and are rising up to defend and consolidate peace. The powerful world peace movement is growing stronger and stronger.
    The broad masses of the people are increasingly aware that defending peace is in the interest of the people of all countries. The fact that more than 600 million people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact vividly demonstrates the people's unwavering will to defend peace and contain the imperialist instigators of war.
    All peace fighters are encouraged in their struggle for peace by Stalin's wise words. He said: "If the people of all countries take up the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."
    The rising people's movement for peace is taking increasingly active and effective forms. In Germany, working people are protesting more strongly against the military agreement concluded by the American, British, and French imperialists and the Bonn revanchist bloc. In Japan, a strike movement is currently underway to protest the separate military treaty concluded with Japan and the fascist anti-labor laws. In France, millions of working people have resolutely expressed their opposition to the fascist police repression and demanded the release of Duclos, Sti, and other French patriots.
    The free people of the democratic and socialist camp are also raising their vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialists. The people of the socialist camp are engaged in peaceful construction work, accelerating the development of the national economy, strengthening the defense capabilities of their countries, and uniting more closely around their true friend, liberator, fighter, and the powerful fortress of world peace—the Soviet Union.
    On the International Day of Solidarity with the Heroic Korean People, the Day of Defending Peace, the working people of all countries and all progressive humanity loudly demand: a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea;
    Unconditional prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and condemnation of the American aggressors for their crimes of using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China;
    Exposure of the inhumane and despicable acts of revenge by American military officers against captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in prisoner-of-war camps.
    The Korean people are defending a just cause. The Soviet people wish the Korean people victory in their heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland.
    May the peace movement—the powerful movement of our time—grow stronger and stronger. (Xinhua News Agency, according to TASS, Moscow, 25th)

    保卫和平日
    苏联“真理报”六月二十五日社论
    今天是朝鲜人民抵抗美帝国主义者的武装干涉的解放战争的两周年纪念日。朝鲜人民对美国干涉军进行英勇的斗争，已经赢得了全世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情。朝鲜已成为被压迫国家和附属国解放运动的旗帜。苏联人民和全体进步人类对于正在跟外国侵略者进行斗争、英雄地保卫自己的自由和独立的英勇的朝鲜人民，致以兄弟的敬礼。
    各国劳动人民和千千万万的和平拥护者为了表示对朝鲜人民的热爱，都纪念六月二十五日，把这一天当作国际积极声援英雄的朝鲜人民日，当作保卫和平日。
    过去半个世纪来的全部历史，说明了帝国主义者如果没有暴力和掠夺，没有鲜血和战火，是不能生存下去的。美帝国主义者是第二次世界大战后的国际和平破坏者。美国政府从准备侵略的政策转到直接进行侵略的行动，走上了对朝鲜进行武装干涉的道路。
    美国侵略集团破坏了远东的和平，他们组织了对朝鲜的侵略，目的不仅要想控制南朝鲜，而且要想控制北朝鲜。他们决心要剥夺朝鲜的民族独立，阻止朝鲜成为一个统一和民主的国家，在朝鲜用暴力建立一个反动的反人民政权，以便美国统治集团把朝鲜变成他们的殖民地并利用朝鲜领土作为他们在远东的军事战略跳板。
    美国军队打着联合国的旗帜侵略朝鲜，并开始进行一个残酷的破坏战争，使朝鲜陷于可怖的灾祸和痛苦之中。美国侵略者在朝鲜大规模地使用最不人道的野蛮战争手段。他们的飞机摧毁非军事性和没有防御的目标，如住宅、学校、医院和庙宇等，企图把整个朝鲜变成一个“荒无人烟的地区”。美国侵略者在朝鲜屠杀了数十万妇女、儿童和老年人。
    美国军队又公然无耻地违反普遍公认的国际法和国际惯例，在朝鲜大规模使用罪恶的细菌武器、毒气和凝固汽油弹。
    美国干涉者在朝鲜的滔天罪行、他们所发动的细菌战、他们在巨济岛——死亡之岛——上对战俘的虐待和屠杀，使全世界大为震动，激怒了全世界的人民。现在，谁都看得出，美国军队是在步着希特勒暴虐政权、血腥强盗的后尘。
    美国干涉者的背信攻击遭到了朝鲜人民的坚决抵抗，朝鲜人民在他们劳动党和人民政府的领导之下，起来进行英雄的斗争，争取他们祖国的自由和独立。保卫自由和民族独立的崇高理想，鼓舞着朝鲜爱国者，使他们在劳动和战斗中创造出大批英雄主义的业迹。光荣的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民并肩努力，对美国侵略者进行斗争，对朝鲜人民给予兄弟的援助，帮助他们保卫他们正义的事业。
    美帝国主义的侵略计划的失败，令人信服地证明了帝国主义对爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行的全盘赌博，是没有什么希望的。朝鲜人民已尝到过自由的快乐，他们决不再受奴役，美帝国主义者过去没有奴役得了他们，将来也奴役不了他们。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜进行的战争，清楚地证明了美国统治集团在战后时期一直奉行的帝国主义侵略政策。美英帝国主义者自己供认，他们认为对朝鲜的干涉，是未来的世界大战的“彩排”。
    美帝国主义者正在煽动战争狂，加紧扩张军备，准备新的世界大战。为了这个目的，他们正在拼凑军事侵略集团，在外国领土上建立许多军事基地。为了同样的目的，他们又与西德的复仇主义者缔结了军事协定，并且正在西德恢复在欧洲进行侵略的法西斯温床。美帝国主义者也在复活日本的军国主义，力图把复活了的日本军队变成他们用来对亚洲人民进行侵略的军队中的突击部队。
    整个的事件发展证明：美国统治集团不要和平，他们害怕和平，害怕各国人民的和平合作，因为这会妨碍他们谋求世界霸权的疯狂计划。他们把战争看做是发财之道。自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，美国的垄断资本已获得了约九百亿美元的利润。美国侵略者们因为战争与人类的鲜血使他们获得了巨大的利润，所以他们不仅阻挠消除在远东业已存在的战争温床，而且还扬言要把战争扩大到其他国家与人民的头上。美国侵略者正设法拖延与破坏因苏联的和平建议而于去年开始的朝鲜停战谈判。
    各国人民不需要战争，他们正日益增强地反对帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋，并挺身而起，保卫与巩固和平。强大的世界和平运动正日益发展壮大中。
    广大人民群众愈来愈明白，保卫和平对各国人民都有关系。世界和平理事会要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言，已有六亿多人民签名，这一事实生动地表明了人民保卫和平与遏制帝国主义战争挑拨者的不屈不挠的意志。
    所有和平战士在争取和平的斗争中，都受到斯大林明智的谈话的鼓舞。他说：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”
    日益高涨的人民争取和平的运动，采取着愈来愈积极和有效的形式。在德国，劳动人民在更为强硬地抗议美英法帝国主义者与波恩复仇主义者集团所缔结的军事协定。在日本，目前正在展开罢工运动，以抗议与日本缔结的单独军事条约和法西斯反劳工法律。在法国，千百万劳动人民坚决地表示反对法西斯警察镇压行动，要求释放杜克洛、斯梯以及法国其他爱国人士。
    民主与社会主义阵营的自由人民也在提高他们对于帝国主义者的阴谋的警惕。社会主义阵营的各国人民正在从事和平建设劳动，加速国民经济的发展，加强他们国家的防御能力，更紧密地团结在他们的真正友人、解放者、战士、全世界和平的强大堡垒——苏联的周围。
    在国际声援英雄的朝鲜人民日，保卫和平日，各国劳动人民和全体进步人类都大声要求：在公正合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，所有外国军队一律撤出朝鲜；
    无条件禁止大规模毁灭的武器，谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的罪行；
    揭露美国军事长官在战俘营对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的非人道的卑鄙的报复行动。
    朝鲜人民保卫的是正义的事业。苏联人民预祝朝鲜人民争取祖国自由和独立的英勇斗争获得胜利。
    愿保卫和平运动——我们时代的强大的运动，声势日壮。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电）
