Our great motherland

The rapid literacy method is being rapidly promoted throughout the country. Tianjin has established a literacy movement committee to ensure that 320,000 illiterate and semi-literate people among the working people of the city can become literate in a short period of time. This is a group of students from the rapid literacy method learning class sponsored by the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions. They are practicing the song "Work Hard, Study Hard, and Put in the Effort."
