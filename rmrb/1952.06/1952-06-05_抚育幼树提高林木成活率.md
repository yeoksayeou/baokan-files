    Nurturing Saplings to Improve Tree Survival Rate
    The spring afforestation work has concluded. The central task for cadres and the masses in forestry areas is to focus on the nurturing and management of trees.
    Last year, the nation afforested 6.8 million mu, but the survival rate was only 65%. Some leading cadres and masses in forestry areas believe that planting saplings is enough to complete the task, neglecting the management and nurturing of the trees. As a result, many saplings either succumbed to wind and rain or were trampled by livestock and died prematurely. This is a major reason for the low survival rate of trees.
    In this spring's afforestation work, some areas have already paid attention to the issue of improving the survival rate of trees. For example, the masses in western Liaoning and other places widely launched irrigation campaigns to combat drought and protect seedlings while constructing the western shelterbelt. The masses in the Jirem League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region put forward the slogan of "guarantee planting, guarantee survival, guarantee nurturing" in afforestation, which is excellent. However, there are still many areas that do not pay enough attention to this issue. For example, some cadres in Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Fujian, and other provinces have the erroneous idea of "managing planting but not survival," which is very harmful.
    The leading organs in forestry areas should learn from last year's lessons. After completing this spring's afforestation work, they should continue to lead the masses, earnestly check the survival of trees, establish a system of responsibility by area and segment as much as possible, prevent livestock damage, and carry out necessary irrigation. This spring's afforestation area is very large, and all regions must conscientiously do this work well in order to consolidate the achievements of afforestation.

### 抚育幼树提高林木成活率

    抚育幼树提高林木成活率
    春季造林工作已经结束，林区干部和群众当前的中心任务是要做好林木的抚育和管理工作。
    去年全国造林六百八十万亩，而成活率仅为百分之六十五。某些林区的领导机关干部和群众，认为只要把树苗栽好，就算完成了任务，而不注意林木的管理和抚育工作；以致许多树苗，或受风雨侵袭，或被牲畜践踏而夭折了。这是林木成活率很低的一个重要原因。
    在今春造林工作中，若干地区已经注意了提高造林成活率的问题。例如，辽西等地群众在营造西部防护林带时，为了抗旱保苗，广泛开展了灌水运动；内蒙古自治区哲里木盟群众在造林中，提出“保栽、保活、保养”的口号，这是很好的。但是，目前仍有不少地区，对这个问题还不重视。例如，黑龙江、陕西、福建等省有些干部，存在着“管种不管活”的错误思想，这是非常有害的。
    林区的领导机关，应该接受去年的教训，在今春造林工作完成以后，继续领导群众，认真检查林木成活情况，尽量建立分片分段负责制度，防止牲畜破坏，进行必要的浇灌。今春造林面积很大，各地必须认真做好这个工作，以巩固造林的成绩。
