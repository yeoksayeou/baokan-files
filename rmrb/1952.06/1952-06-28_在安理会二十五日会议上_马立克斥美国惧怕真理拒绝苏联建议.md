Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 26th (TASS): The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the morning of the 25th. After a brief discussion of procedural matters, it was decided to include the US-proposed investigation of accusations of the use of bacteriological weapons on the agenda. Ten member states of the Security Council voted in favor of including this item on the agenda. The Soviet Union voted against it. In explaining his reasons for voting against, Malik pointed out that he had said before that the Soviet Union's attitude would depend on whether the Security Council invited representatives of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the Security Council's discussion of this issue.

Malik said that because the Anglo-American bloc had rejected the Soviet proposal—namely, including the US-proposed issue on the agenda while inviting representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—he voted against including the US proposal on the agenda.

Malik pointed out that it was impossible to study this issue without the participation of representatives from China and North Korea. He said that the attitude of the US delegation showed that the United States feared the truth and feared the participation of representatives of the Chinese and Korean peoples in the discussion.

After speeches by Greek representative Kiru and Chiang Tingfu of the Kuomintang clique, Malik said that because the issue raised by the United States had been included on the agenda, the Security Council must hold a vote on the part of the Soviet proposal that suggested inviting representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The Security Council then resumed discussion of the Soviet-proposed agenda item: urging all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare.

    在安理会二十五日会议上
    马立克斥美国惧怕真理拒绝苏联建议
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国安全理事会二十五日上午举行会议，在简短地讨论了程序问题后，决定将美国提出的调查使用细菌武器指责的问题列入议程。安全理事会十个会员国投票赞成将这个项目列入议程。苏联投票反对。马立克在解释投票反对的理由时指出：他以前已经说过，苏联的态度将视安全理事会是否邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加安全理事会讨论这个问题而定。
    马立克说：因为英美集团拒绝了苏联提出的建议：即一方面将美国提出的问题列入议程、同时邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表；所以他投票反对将美国建议列入议程。
    马立克指出：没有中国和北朝鲜代表参加，是不可能研究这个问题的。他说：美国代表团的态度显出美国惧怕真理，惧怕中国人民和朝鲜人民的代表参加讨论。
    在希腊代表基鲁和国民党集团的蒋廷黻演说后，马立克说：因为美国提出的问题已被列入议程，所以安全理事会必须对苏联提案中建议邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的一部分举行表决。
    安全理事会然后又恢复讨论苏联提出的议程项目：敦促各国参加并批准禁止细菌战的日内瓦议定书。
