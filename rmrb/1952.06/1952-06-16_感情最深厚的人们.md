The Chinese People's Volunteer Army are the bravest people in the world. In the face of vicious enemies, they are like lions. Their hearts are harder than steel. When they are unarmed and can only engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, they will tear off the enemy's ears with their bare hands. But towards their own people, they are the most sentimental people in the world. Their feelings are so deep, so thick, so considerate, so meticulous, so noble and selfless!

Such examples can be told by the dozens or hundreds. Here, I will only select one, because this is a very ordinary, commonplace matter in the Volunteer Army, something that exists in almost every unit.

A battalion of our army on the Kaesong front was guarding a certain position. They had been confronting the enemy here for almost half a year. In order to take care of their fatigue, the higher-ups decided to assign another unit to take over their defense, so they could come down and rest. The first time they heard they were being rotated, everyone wrote petitions to the higher-ups, asking not to be replaced. The reasons were, of course, many, but boiled down to two things. One, Kaesong is a "holy land of peace" watched by the eyes of the world, and everyone has made up their minds to defend Kaesong to the end. Being replaced halfway for rest is more unpleasant than being punished. The other, which could not be written in the petition, but was in everyone's heart: Everyone has been here for half a year, digging day and night. Everyone's palms, I don't know how many layers of calluses have been worn off, everyone's sweat, I don't know how many liters and pecks have been shed. In order to turn their fortifications into steel fortresses, everyone's several-foot-long pickaxe has been ground down to only a few inches. Then, they find scrap iron, set up bellows, create a blacksmith's furnace, and forge new pickaxes to continue digging. In order to make their fortifications into steel fortresses, everyone is willing to secretly take out the oil they eat, so that the lights in the dark tunnels keep burning, so that the construction time can be longer. Sometimes even the edible oil is used up, so they use broken tires and broken rubber shoes as "lights" to burn and continue to repair, continue to dig. Now, this has not only become a steel fortress, where thousands of enemy shells can fall on it, and meetings, studies, and entertainment can still be held inside, but this steel fortress is also a very good "home". Inside, there is "Stalin Road," "Mao Zedong Road," "Victory Street," there are "bedrooms," "ammunition rooms," a "position club," "hygiene bath rooms," a "delousing station," and "safe toilets"... This "home," built with their own hands and blood and sweat through hard work, everything feels especially "pleasing" and particularly "satisfactory". This was built over half a year, braving the threat of enemy planes and artillery. The front of this fortress is littered with the corpses of invading enemies. Now, to leave here is like a mother handing over her child, and it is very reluctant in her heart.

However, a request is only a request. Finally, the higher-ups' order came: The day after tomorrow at dusk, a friendly army battalion will come to take over the defense.

When the order was just passed down level by level, the soldiers felt a little empty for a very short time. The person who was singing stopped singing, and the person who was competing also supported the pickaxe and thought. The cook, who had just carried a load of water from the foot of the mountain with a sweaty face, also put down the load and said regretfully, "I really can't bear these water tanks, they were all pushed up one by one from the hillside!"

However, this time was only very short, and everyone became active again. The squad leader first broke the silence, laughing loudly, "What's wrong? After living here for half a year, have you all become sentimental old women? Let's think back, don't we have a hundred or eighty 'homes'? Not even counting the years in the motherland, just after arriving in Korea, where haven't we been? Leaving one place, the Korean old woman tugs at the corner of our clothes and sheds tears, isn't our heart still burning? Arriving at one place, loving one place, isn't that place our home? If the American devils are not eliminated for a day, who knows how many homes we will have to change!"

What the squad leader said made everyone feel very right. The Communist Party members took up their tools first, shouting, "Although we are going to hand over the defense tomorrow, we can't relax for a single second today! The more effort we put in, the more sweat we shed, the more safety the friendly army will have when they come up, and the more enemies they will eliminate." Everyone said, "Right! When the friendly army comes up, carrying dozens of kilograms of things, climbing dozens of miles of mountains, they won't be tired enough. They just came up, they are not familiar with the road, let's arrange everything for them, so that they can rest for a day or two without working when they come up." In this way, with a shout, everyone worked even harder. The ones digging fortifications continued to swing the shovels in their hands, the cook grabbed the carrying pole on the ground again, the bellows of the blacksmith's furnace rang again crackling, and the duty of chopping wood went to the depths of the mountain with an axe. On this day when they were about to leave the position, they worked even harder, and there was more singing and laughter than before. In the army, good news has wings, and it was immediately spread to every platoon and every class. Everyone was tidying up their "home", arranging it more beautifully to welcome the new comrades.

When the sun was about to set, they did an inspection: Every "room", every "road", every "street" was cleaned spotlessly; every kang was covered with dry and soft bedding grass; every water tank was full, and even the large gasoline drum in the "hygiene bath room" was filled with water and heated to be warm; every place to hang a gun was replaced with newly made iron nails, every "room" was hung with a wooden sign, and every type of ammunition box was labeled; The large boiler of the "delousing station" was also burning hot, preparing to eliminate all the lice as soon as they arrived, and every bundle of firewood was arranged into neat stacks. All the things in the "club" were left behind, the erhu made from canned boxes, the cymbals and gongs made from scrap steel, the wooden poker cards... Only the portrait of Chairman Mao, which everyone was most reluctant to leave behind, originally some people said that this must be taken away no matter what, but after discussion, it was decided to leave it behind, and in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao, all kinds of fresh flowers picked when chopping wood were placed.

After a while, the platoon leader came, smiling and saying, "The tidying up is not bad, whoever comes to take over the defense will be extra energetic and eliminate a few more American devils... They will be coming soon. Boil more boiling water, put two basins at the entrance of each hole, they will be so thirsty when they come up that they will want to drink even cold water..." Saying that, he went to another class, and before leaving, he turned his head and said, "... You won't have anyone who is not at ease with your position, the friendly army coming up is very famous..."

The platoon leader left, and the tunnels became even more lively. The ones taking over the position were actually a unit that had made great achievements. How should we comfort and reward them? Everyone thought this way in their hearts. When one person said it, everyone clapped and cheered. This one took out a bar of soap, that one took out a towel, this one took out half a pack of cigarettes, that one took out a can of canned goods. A young kid took out a silk white handkerchief from his pocket. He said, "This was made from the parachute of the enemy's flare that I picked up on the hillside the other day when I was delivering a letter. I wanted to bring it back to my motherland for my sister, but let's leave it here for the new comrades to wipe their sweat!" In this way, one piece from you, one piece from me, in a few minutes, it was a small pile.

Everything was ready, but it always felt like something was missing. The squad leader said, "I always think, there is still something missing, but I can't remember." A soldier said, "I also think so. What's missing? According to me, the main thing missing is the opportunity to talk and shake hands. Didn't the company commander say that only a few liaison personnel are left to contact them, and the rest are agreed time, they come up on that road, we go down on this road? Just leaving some dumb things that can't talk, it feels very awkward!" The squad leader said, "You said it right, that's what's missing, why don't we write some clapper rhymes for them to leave behind?" This remark was originally speaking to everyone's heart, but many people were afraid of not writing well, and said with red faces, "I can't do it, don't put a duck on the shelf." The squad leader said with a straight face, "Don't be a dumb soldier, everyone should encourage, everyone should promote..." Saying this, everyone frowned and turned on their thinking machines, and they wrote it out in a little while. Everyone found some paper and wrote it crookedly, some were pasted on the towel they sent, some were pasted on the soap they sent, some were pasted on the walls of the hole, some were pasted at the intersection of the road facing them. These poems are: The cannons rumble and shake the sky, Brothers separate on the hillside, Although brothers have not met, It's like the same father and the same mother. ×××× Winter goes and spring comes, hundreds of flowers are fragrant, Brothers meet on the hillside, Brother respectfully offers nothing else, This hole can defend against enemy artillery. ×××× Brothers separate in Panlong, I have long heard of Brother's victory name, Ammunition in the cave is like a mountain, Exert power to kill the enemy. ×××× The gift is meager and indescribable, I hope Brother doesn't dislike it, Class brothers have deep feelings, Your heart and my heart are closely connected. ×××× This soap is square and square, Leave it for Brother to wash clothes, Wash clothes often, be healthy, Eliminate more American wolves. ×××× Good towel for defending the country, A piece of heart from the people of the motherland, Leave it for Brother to wipe sweat, Full of energy to kill the enemy. Every place was filled with such clapper rhymes and couplets. The sentry of the monitoring post posted such couplets at his monitoring post: "Two eyes staring straight ahead, Kill the enemy and make meritorious service on the battlefield." At the place leading to the front of the position, it was written, "Take good precautions against air raids and artillery, Don't expose targets on the position." The young communication soldier explained his heart to the new communication soldier brother, writing on the cave of the communication class: "Accept the task clearly, Explain the victory carefully." And add a horizontal inscription "Go and return quickly." The hygienist wrote on the bathtub made of a large gasoline drum: "If you want the position to be hygienic, Don't forget to take a bath often." Everyone wrote their hearts on it.

Finally, they said, "Although we have been digging these fortifications for nearly half a year, in order to eliminate more enemies, in order to prevent our possible losses, we have to explain to the friendly army and let them continue to do it!" After discussing this, everyone jointly composed another clapper: "Fight a good position war, Fortifications are the most important, Make great achievements on the battlefield, It is a good capital. If you want to shed less blood, You have to sweat more. Fortifications become steel, It is difficult for the enemy to survive."

They had just finished writing and pasting it, when the female art troupe members who taught them to sing came to the front of the position. They said, "We have no culture, and we wrote a mess. Don't make fun of us." The female comrade looked around and her eyes flashed with tears, she said, "I don't understand either, but I think it's very good and very touching!"

At dusk, the instructor came to inform that the liaison personnel of the friendly army had arrived, and the friendly army taking over the defense had bypassed the foot of the mountain. Except for those who stayed to handle the handover, immediately line up and go down the mountain. In order to better pass through the enemy's artillery blockade, the troops going down the mountain took another road. In this way, a few minutes later, they went down the mountain from another road.

April 29, 1952, on the Kaesong Front

    感情最深厚的人们
    李蕤
    中国人民志愿军，是世界上最勇敢的人，在凶残的敌人面前，他们是一只狮子，他们的心，比钢铁还要硬，他们到了手里没有武器，只能用徒手和敌人肉搏的时候，就活生生把敌人的耳朵咬掉。但是，对于自己人，他们又是世界上最有感情的，他们的感情是那样的深，那样的厚，那样的周到，那样的细致，那样崇高而无私！
    这样的事例，是可以说出几十几百件的，在这里，我只选出一件，因为这是在志愿军中很普通的平常事，几乎每一个部队里都有的。
    开城前线我军某部一个营，他们扼守着某阵地。他们在这里和敌人对峙，已经快半年了。上级为了照顾他们的疲劳，决定指定别的部队上去接防，让他们下来休息一下。他们第一次听到要叫他们下来的时候，大家都纷纷向上级写请求书，要求不要把他们换下来。理由当然很多，但归结起来，不外两条，一个呢，开城是全世界眼睛看着的“和平圣地”，每个人都已经下定决心，保卫开城要保卫到底，半路换下去休息，比受处罚还难过。另外一个呢，没法写到请求书上，但却是大家心眼里的话：大家在这里已经半年，日里也挖，夜里也挖，每个人的手掌，不知道磨落了多少层茧子，每个人的汗，不知道出了几升几斗，为了把自己的工事变成钢铁堡垒，他们每个人几尺长的洋镐，都磨的只剩几寸，然后又自己找废铁，自己架风箱，创造出铁匠炉，再打成新的铁镐，继续的挖；为了使自己的工事变成钢铁堡垒，每人情愿把自己吃的油都偷偷拿出来，让黑黝黝的洞子里灯光不断，挖工事的时间好能更长一些，有时候连吃的油也用完了，就用破车胎破胶鞋作为“亮子”燃着，继续修，继续挖。现在，这里不仅成了钢铁堡垒，敌人几千发炮弹落在上面，里面照样开会、学习、娱乐，而且，这钢铁堡垒也就是很好的“家”，这里面有“斯大林路”，“毛泽东路”，“胜利街”，有“寝室”，“弹药室”，有“阵地俱乐部”，有“卫生洗澡间”，有“灭虱站”，有“保险厕所”……。自己的双手自己的血汗千辛万苦建立起来的“家”，一切都觉着特别“顺眼”分外“满意”，这是半年来冒着敌人飞机大炮的威胁修成的，这堡垒的前沿躺满过一批批来犯敌人的死尸。如今要离开这里，就和母亲要把自己的孩子交出去一样，心里是十分舍不得的。
    但是，请求只是请求，最后上级的命令来了：后天黄昏，友军某营，便要来接防。
    当命令刚刚一级级传达下来的时候，很短一个时间内，战士们都感到有些空落落的。正在唱歌的人歌声也停了，正在竞赛着的人也扶着铁镐想心思。炊事员刚刚满脸大汗的从山下担回来一挑水，也放下挑子，惋惜地说：“真舍不得这些水缸，都是从山坡下一个个推上来的！”
    但是，这样的时间只有很短一会儿，大家便又活跃起来。班长首先打破沉默，大声笑着说：“咋着？在这里住了半年，都变成婆婆妈妈心肠啦？咱们回头想想，咱们的‘家’还没个百儿八十个的？就不算上在祖国的几年，光这到朝鲜后，什么地方没到过？离开一个地方，朝鲜的老妈妈拉着衣裳角流眼泪，咱们的心里还不是热辣辣的？到一处，爱上一处，那个地方还不都是咱们的家呀。美国鬼子一天不消灭，还不知道要换多少家哩！”
    班长这样一讲，大家都觉得很对。共产党员们首先就拿起家伙，高喊道：“咱们虽然明天就要交防，今天也不能放松一分一秒的时间呀！咱们多出一把力，多流一滴汗，友军上来就多增加一分安全，多消灭几个敌人。”大家说：“对！友军上来，背着几十斤重的东西，爬几十里的山，还不累得够呛，他们刚刚上来，道又不熟，咱们把一切都替他们安排得好好的，叫他们上来后能歇一两天不干活。”就这样，发一声喊，都更加劲的干起来。挖工事的，继续挥动着手里的铁锹，炊事员又抓起地上的扁担，打铁的鼓风炉又劈劈拍拍的响起来，值班打柴的又提着斧头向山的深处走去。在他们要离开阵地这一天，干活干得更外起劲，歌声和笑声也比从前更多。在部队里，好的消息是有翅膀的，立刻便传到每一个排和每一个班，大家都在整理自己的“家”，把它安排的更漂亮一些，迎接新来的战友们。
    夕阳快要落山的时候，他们作了一遍检查：每一个“屋子”，每一条“路”，每一条“街”，都打扫得干干净净；每一个炕上，都铺上又干又软的铺草；每一个水缸都是满满的，连“卫生洗澡间”的大汽油筒中，都打满了水，而且烧得温乎乎的；每一个挂枪的地方都换了新打出的铁钉，每一个“屋子”都挂上木牌，每种弹药箱都贴标签；“灭虱站”的大锅炉也烧得滚热，准备他们一到后就把虱子灭净，每一捆柴都整理成整整齐齐的垛子。“俱乐部”里的东西，统统留下了，用罐头盒自造的胡琴，用废镔铁造成的铜鼓和铙钗，木板刻的扑克……。只有毛主席像，原是大家最舍不得留下的，最初有人说这可无论如何要带走，后来经过商量，还是决定留下，并且在毛主席像的前面，摆满了打柴时摘回的各种鲜花。
    一会，排长来了，笑着说：“收拾得不错，谁来接防，都会格外有劲，多消灭几个美国鬼子哩。……他们不久便要来到了。多烧一些开水，每个洞子门口放它两盆盆，他们一上来会渴得连冷水也想喝的……”说着，便到别一班去了，临走，转回头来说：“……你们不会有人不放心自己的阵地吧，又上来的友军，可是大名鼎鼎的哩……”
    排长走了，坑道里就更热闹起来，接替阵地的，原来是立过大功的部队呀，应该怎样慰劳慰劳他们才是呀，大家心里都这样想，一个人一说出来，大家就一齐拍手欢呼起来，这个拿出一块肥皂，那个拿出一条毛巾，这个拿出半盒纸烟，那个拿出一筒罐头。一个年轻的小鬼，从衣袋里掏出一块丝质的洁白的手帕，他说：“这是我那一天送信，在山坡里拾到的敌人照明弹上的降落伞做成的，我想捎回祖国给我的姐姐的，留在这里给新来的战友们擦汗吧！”就这样，你一件我一件，几分钟里，就是一个小堆堆儿。
    一切都停当啦，但总觉着还差一些什么东西。班长说：“我总想着，还缺少一些什么东西，可就想不起来。”一个战士说：“我也是这样想。缺啥哩？按我说主要的是缺少说说话握握手的机会，连长不是说，只留下几个联络人员和他们接头，剩下的都是约定时间，他们那一条路上来，咱们这一条路下去么？光留下些哑巴东西，不会说话，心里怪别扭的哩！”班长说：“可说对了，就是差这，咱们编些快板诗给他们留下不好么？”这话本来正说到大家心窝里，可是许多人又怕编不好，红着脸说：“我可不行，别打鸭子上架。”班长一本正经说：“不做哑巴兵么，人人鼓动，人人宣传么……”这样一说，大家就绉着眉头各自打开思想机器，不多一会就编出来了。大家找了些纸，就歪歪斜斜写出来，有的是贴在自己送的毛巾上的，有的是贴在自己送的肥皂上的，有的是贴在洞里的墙壁上的，有的是贴在迎面来的路口的。这些诗是：大炮隆隆震天响，兄弟分别在山岗，兄弟虽然未见面，好像同爹又同娘。
    ××××冬去春来百花香，兄弟相见在山岗，弟敬兄来无别赠，此洞可把敌炮防。
    ××××兄弟分别在盘龙，久闻大哥胜利名，洞内弹药如山堆，发挥威力杀敌兵。
    ××××礼物微薄不可言，希望大哥不要嫌，阶级兄弟感情厚，你心我心紧接连。
    ××××这块肥皂方又方，留给大哥洗衣裳，衣裳常洗身体好，多多消灭美国狼。
    ××××保家卫国好毛巾，祖国人民一片心，留下大哥擦把汗，精神饱满杀敌人。各个地方，都贴满了这样的快板诗和对联，监视哨的哨兵，在自己的监视哨贴下这样的对联：“两眼注视正前方，杀敌立功在战场。”通往阵地前沿的地方，写着“防空防炮隐蔽好，阵地不要露目标。”年青的通讯员，给新来的通讯员弟兄交代自己心里的话，在通讯班的洞子上写：“接受任务要清楚，交代胜利别马虎。”并且加上个横批“快去快回”。卫生员在大汽油桶做成的澡盆上写着：“要想阵地卫生好，别忘人人多洗澡。”每个人都把自己的心写上去了。
    最后，他们说：“这些工事，咱们虽然已经挖了将近半年，但是，为了消灭更多的敌人，为了防备我们万一的损失，还得交代友军，让他们继续做下去呀！”这样一商量，大家就又共同编了一首快板：
    “打好阵地战，工事最当先，战场立大功，它
    是好本钱。要想少流血，就得多流汗。工事成钢
    铁，敌人难生还。”
    他们刚写好贴上，在阵地前沿教他们唱歌的女文工团员来了。他们说：“我们没有文化，胡乱写了一通，你们可别笑话。”那个女同志各处看了一遍，感动得眼里闪出泪光，她说：“我也不懂得，不过我觉得很好，很动人！”
    黄昏的时候，指导员来通知，说友军的联络人员已经到了，接防的友军已经绕过山脚，除了留下办交接的人员，立刻整队下山。为了更好通过敌人炮火的封锁，下山部队走另一条路。这样，几分钟后，他们就从另一条路走下山去。
    一九五二年四月二十九日于开城前线
