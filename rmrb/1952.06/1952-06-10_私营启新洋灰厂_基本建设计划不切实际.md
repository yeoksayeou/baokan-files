    Private Qixin Cement Plant
    Basic Construction Plan is Unrealistic
    Editor: The private Qixin Cement Plant in Tangshan has significant blindness in its basic construction plans. The plant already has a good train shed, but the factory plans to spend 160 million yuan to build two more train sheds nearby, supposedly "to shelter the locomotives from the rain." This factory has never stored six hundred large barrels of oil, but the factory now plans to spend 459 million yuan to build an oil depot capable of holding six hundred large barrels of oil. The existing toilets in the factory are generally sufficient, but the plan is to build fifteen flush toilets, at a cost of over 900 million yuan. The potential of the existing machinery and equipment in the repair shop has not been fully utilized, but the factory has already planned to spend 1.4 billion yuan to purchase new machines. There are many such unrealistic plans. In the construction projects that are needed, there is also serious waste due to improper design. For example, repairing the factory's drains is planned to be done with reinforced concrete bottoms and covers, with the entire project costing over 3.6 billion yuan. This is unnecessary, because using reinforced concrete only where necessary can also ensure the quality of the project. This would save more than 2 billion yuan.
    According to preliminary estimates, the non-directly productive basic construction investment of this factory accounts for 49.2 percent of the total investment. However, the projects that can be postponed or cancelled, and the projects that need to be carried out but whose budgets can be reduced, account for 27.7 percent of the total basic construction investment. I believe that Qixin Cement Plant should quickly correct this practice and must make a realistic basic construction plan for this year based on the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, distinguishing the importance and urgency of the projects.
                                                                                                          Ruan Er

### 私营启新洋灰厂  基本建设计划不切实际

    私营启新洋灰厂
    基本建设计划不切实际
    编辑同志：唐山市私营启新洋灰厂在基本建设的计划方面存在着很大的盲目性。该厂本来有一个很好的火车房，厂方又计划用一亿六千多万元在附近再建筑两个火车房，据说是“为了火车头避雨”。这个厂从来没有存过六百大桶油，但厂方现在却计划用四亿五千九百万元造一所能容六百大桶油的油库。厂里原有的厕所一般已经够用，但在计划中，又要建筑水冲厕所十五个，这项建筑的费用就得九亿多元。修机厂现有的机器设备的潜在力量还没有充分发挥出来，厂方却已计划用十四亿元购买新机器了。这种不切实际的计划多得很。在需要建筑的工程中，因为设计不当，浪费现象也很严重。比如修理全厂水沟，计划都用钢筋水泥砌底，并且加盖，全部工程要花三十六亿多元。这是不需要的。因为只在必要的地方使用钢筋水泥，也能保证工程质量。这样，可节省二十多亿元。
    据初步估计，这个厂非直接生产的基本建设投资，占全部投资的百分之四十九点二。但在计划中可以不办或者缓办，以及需要办理而可缩减预算的，竟占全部基本建设投资的百分之二十七点七。我认为启新洋灰厂应迅速改正这种做法，必须本着增产节约的精神，分别工程的轻重缓急，作出今年度真正切合实际的基本建设计划。阮耳
