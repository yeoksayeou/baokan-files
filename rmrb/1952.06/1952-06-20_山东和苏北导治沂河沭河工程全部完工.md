The entire Yishuhe and Shuhue River diversion project in Shandong Province and the Northern Jiangsu Region was victoriously completed in mid-June. This great river management project began in 1949 and lasted for more than three years, with a total of more than two million workers involved. The main part of the project was to open up a new and wide waterway to the sea for the Shuhue River and the Yishue River in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu respectively. The total earthwork was 120 million cubic meters, the total stonework was 3 million cubic meters, and there were more than 80 modern dams, culverts and other permanent buildings. If these soils were used to build a long dam one meter high and one meter wide, it could circle the Earth's equator about three times. The successful completion of this project has freed five million people in the Yishuhe and Shuhue River basins of Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu from the disasters of floods; more than 10 million mu of farmland along the river, which used to suffer from poor harvests in nine out of ten years, will be guaranteed annual harvests.

The Yishue River and the Shuhue River are two large rivers in southern Shandong Province, China. The Yishue River originates in Yishue County, Shandong Province, and flows south into Northern Jiangsu. Before the diversion, a branch of the lower reaches of the Yishue River flowed into the Grand Canal through Qutang Estuary, Shajiakou Estuary and Erdaokou Estuary; while the main stream flowed into Luoma Lake, and then transferred into the North and South Liutang Rivers to the sea. The Shuhue River originates in Juxian County, Shandong Province, and flows south into the Qiangwei River in Northern Jiangsu, then turns northeast at Shuyang County and flows into the sea from Lihong Estuary. The terrain in the upper reaches of both the Yishue and Shuhue rivers is very inclined, and the water is turbulent. They are both "flash flood" rivers. However, the lower reaches of the two rivers are the Northern Jiangsu Plain, and the riverbeds are gradually silted up, and the discharge is extremely unsmooth. The maximum flow of the upper reaches of the Yishue River can reach 6,500 cubic meters per second, while the North and South Liutang Rivers in the lower reaches can only discharge about 1,000 cubic meters of water to the sea. The maximum flow of the upper reaches of the Shuhue River reaches 2,500 cubic meters per second, while the flow of its main downstream Qiangwei River out of Lihong Estuary is less than 200 cubic meters per second. Therefore, large areas of fertile land north and south of the Longhai Railway in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu have been plagued by floods for hundreds of years, especially in the past one or two decades, due to the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the river courses in Northern Jiangsu have been in disrepair for a long time, and the floods have become more and more serious. About 18 million mu of farmland along the river are almost annually ravaged by floods. After more than three consecutive years of diversion by the People's Government, today, the face of the Yishue River and the Shuhue River has been completely changed. Now, the lower reaches of the Yishue River have been separated from the Grand Canal, and a wide new waterway to the sea, the so-called New Yishue River, has been newly opened between Suqian County in the Northern Jiangsu Region and the Yellow Sea. This new Yishue River is 190 kilometers long. From then on, the floods coming down from Shandong in the upper reaches of the Yishue River can flow directly into the sea smoothly through the New Yishue River, without flowing around and causing floods in the Grand Canal and Liutang Rivers. After the Shuhue River was "split mountains and opened roads", a new river channel directly to Lihong Estuary was opened on the Longhai Railway, so it does not have to flow through the Longhai Railway and into the narrow Qiangwei River. The new river channel of the Shuhue River is from Muzhuang and Daguanzhuang in Linshue County, Shandong Province, splitting the mountains to the east, passing through an original small river Shahe into the sea. In this way, the new Shuhue River is 130 kilometers shorter than the old Shuhue River, and the drainage volume of the new Shuhue River is greatly increased compared with the old river channel. Three-quarters of the floodwater can flow smoothly into the sea, and the remaining water volume can also irrigate the farmland on both sides of the old Shahe River.

The Shuhue River diversion project started in the spring of 1949, and the Yishue River diversion project also started in the winter of the same year. At the beginning of the construction, the two provinces and regions of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu had just been liberated, and millions of troops were waiting to cross the river, and the country's financial situation was still very difficult. However, the Communist Party and the People's Government were eager to relieve the suffering of the people in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu provinces and regions caused by the perennial floods of the Yishue and Shuhue rivers, and started the project of diverting the Yishue and Shuhue rivers under various difficult conditions. At that time, due to the urgency of time, the planning and design and various preparations were not complete. The People's Government resolutely carried out the construction while continuing the design. At that time, most of the migrant workers participating in the diversion project were victims of severe floods. They were very enthusiastic, but their bodies were weak. The People's Government used work as a form of relief to provide vigorous assistance.

Due to inaccurate exploration, after the start of the Shuhue River diversion project, it was discovered that opening up the new diversion channel of the Shuhue River and splitting the mountains required 3 million cubic meters of stonework. At that time, many people lost confidence. The Communist Party members and labor models among the migrant workers bravely undertook the task of opening the way for the Shuhue River with selfless labor, and led the vast number of migrant workers to attack the Maling Mountain. After a difficult battle, they finally won. The Yishue River diversion project in Northern Jiangsu was more complex and arduous. The New Yishue River had to be separated from the Grand Canal and turned eastward. Similarly, it had to split the Zhang Mountain that blocked the way. Moreover, on the plain, it was necessary to build a completely new river channel about 190 kilometers long from Zhang Mountain to Guanhe Estuary, and two large embankments of the same length had to be built on both sides. Before the completion of the New Yishue River, it was also necessary to use Luoma Lake to store floodwater, so it was necessary to build the Luoma Lake Reservoir and the Zaohe Water Diversion Dam. This year, the People's Government, considering the long-term interests, also dismantled the Zaohe Town Water Diversion Dam, and rebuilt the three major water gates: Zaohe Control Gate, Luoma Lake Control Gate and Zaohe Ship Lock. Such a complex and arduous project, after three years of efforts by the People's Government and the people of Northern Jiangsu, finally overcame all difficulties and was completed. On May 30 this year, when the water of the Shuhue River flowed smoothly into the new river channel, the entire Shuhue River and Yishue River diversion project was declared a victorious completion.

Now, the project of diverting the Yishue River and the Shuhue River has been victoriously completed, but this is only the beginning of the radical cure of floods for the people of Shandong and Northern Jiangsu. In order to completely eliminate the floods in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, they will then further manage the Grand Canal, the Wen River and the Si River. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 山东和苏北导治沂河沭河工程全部完工

    山东和苏北导治沂河沭河工程全部完工
    山东省和苏北区导治沂河和沭河的全部工程已在本月中旬胜利竣工。这一伟大的治河工程，从一九四九年开始，前后经历了三年多的时间，施工的员工前后共达二百多万人。这个工程主要是在鲁南和苏北为沭河和沂河各开辟了一条新的宽阔的入海河道，全部工程的土方共为一亿二千万公方，石方共为三百万公方，现代化的闸坝、涵洞等永久性建筑物共八十多座。要是把这些土筑成高、宽各一公尺的长坝，约可绕地球赤道三周。这一工程的胜利完工，使鲁南、苏北沂河、沭河流域的五百万人民摆脱了洪水的灾害；沿河十年九不收的一千多万亩农田，将保证年年得到收成。
    沂河和沭河是我国山东省南部的两条大河。沂河发源于山东省沂水县，南流入苏北。导治以前，沂河下游一支分曲由瞿溏口、沙家口和二道口流入运河；而干流入骆马湖，再转入南北六塘河入海。沭河发源于山东莒县，南流入苏北的蔷薇河，到沭阳县折东北流由临洪口入海。沂、沭两河上游地形都很倾斜，水势湍急，都属“暴源性”河流。但两河下游是苏北平原，河床日渐淤塞，宣泄极其不畅。沂河上游最高流量可达六千五百秒公方，而下游南北六塘河只能下泄约一千秒公方的水出海。沭河上游最高流量达二千五百秒公方，而其主要的下游蔷薇河出临洪口的流量却不足二百秒公方。所以，陇海路南北鲁南苏北的大片肥美的土地，几百年来一直闹水灾，特别是近一、二十年来，由于国民党的反动统治，苏北河道年久失修，水灾愈演愈烈。沿河约有一千八百万亩农田几乎每年都要遭受洪水的蹂躏。经过人民政府连续三年多的导治之后，今天，沂河、沭河的面貌已完全改观。现在，沂河下游已经和中运河分家，另在苏北区的宿迁县到黄海之间，新辟了一道宽阔的新的入海道，即所谓新沂河。这段新的沂河全长达一百九十公里。从此沂河上游从山东下来的洪水，可以经新沂河顺畅地直流入海，而不致四处横流，引起运河和六塘等河的水灾。沭河经过“劈山开道”，在陇海路开了一条直流到临洪口的新河道后，也不必流过陇海路，冲入狭窄的蔷薇河了。沭河的新河道是从山东临沭县的木庄和大官庄间，向东劈开山岭，经原有的一条小河沙河入海，这样，新的沭河就比旧沭河缩短了一百三十公里行程，而新沭河的排水量却比旧河道大大增加，四分之三的洪水可以顺畅入海，其余的水量还可灌溉旧沙河两岸的农田。
    导治沭河的工程是在一九四九年春季开工的，导治沂河工程也在同年冬季开工。开始施工时，山东、苏北两省区刚刚解放，百万大军急待渡江，国家财经状况还很困难。但是，共产党和人民政府急于解除沂、沭河长年水患带给山东、苏北两省区人民的疾苦，便在各种困难条件下开始了导治沂、沭两河的工程。当时，由于时间匆促，规划设计，各种准备都不完备，人民政府便一面毅然施工，一面继续设计。当时参加导治工程的民工大部分是深受水患的灾民。他们热情很高，但是体衰力弱，人民政府便以工代赈，大力救济。
    由于探测不精确，导沭工程开工后，才发觉开挖沭河的新引河，劈开山岭须作三百万公方的石方。当时，许多人都失却了信心。民工中的共产党员和劳动模范以奋不顾身的劳动，勇敢地担当了为沭河开道的任务，带领广大的民工向马陵山进攻。经过坚苦的战斗，他们终于胜利了。苏北的导沂工程更加复杂和艰苦。新沂河要和运河分家，折向东流，同样要劈开阻路的嶂山，而且要在平地上，横穿许多小河，修一条完全新的，从嶂山到灌河口长约一百九十公里新河道，而且两岸要筑两条同样长的大堤。新沂河完工前，又须利用骆马湖蓄洪，因而还要修筑骆马湖蓄水库和皂河束水坝。今年，人民政府从长远利益打算，又拆除了皂河镇束水坝，改建了皂河节制闸、骆马湖节制闸和皂河船闸三大水闸。这样复杂艰巨的工程，经人民政府和苏北人民三年的努力，也战胜一切困难终于完成了。今年五月三十日，当沭河的流水顺畅地流入新河道时，整个导沭治沂工程便宣告胜利完成。
    现在，导治沂河、沭河的工程胜利完工了，但这还只是山东和苏北人民根治水患的开端。为了彻底消灭鲁南和苏北的水灾，他们紧接着就要进一步治理运河、汶河和泗水。（新华社）
