    Promote the Spirit of Bold Innovation Among Technicians

    The experience of the design office of the Central Government Construction Office in improving labor organization and implementing assembly-line work methods most powerfully demonstrates that technicians can find clever solutions, tap potential, and carry out various necessary reforms in their work.

    In terms of the demands of national construction, the number of our technicians and their technical capabilities are far from sufficient. Many bourgeois practices still remain in our technical work; the bourgeois technical thinking of some technicians has not been thoroughly liquidated. This prevents their potential strength from being effectively utilized. This situation was fully demonstrated in past production movements, and will inevitably become more serious with the start of large-scale national economic construction.

    Why are there still so few reforms in technical work? This is because some technicians have not yet established the basic ideology and work attitude of serving the people. They often consider personal gains and losses, putting the overall interests aside. In this way, their own enthusiasm and creativity cannot be brought into play. Even when others put forward new work initiatives, they raise various inexplicable "reasons" to oppose them. Last year, a construction company in Beijing prepared to implement similar improvements in design work. However, because many designers were willing to "do their own thing" and were unwilling to work collectively with others, the proposed improvements at that time could not be realized at all.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the bourgeois ideology of many technicians was severely criticized, and their inventions and creations began to increase. Of course, this does not mean that the bourgeois ideology among technicians has been eliminated and that ideological reform can be discontinued; on the contrary, we should advocate various reforms in technical work. When carrying out reforms, we must conduct criticism and self-criticism among technicians in a guided manner, helping technicians overcome various personal plans that hinder the collective cause. Only in this way can the suggestions for various improvements be smoothly realized.

    发扬技术人员大胆创造的精神
    中直修建办事处设计室改进劳动组织，实行流水作业法的经验，最有力地说明了技术人员能够在工作中寻找窍门，挖掘潜力，进行各种必要的改革。
    就国家建设事业的要求来说，我们的技术人员的数量以及他们的技术能力，都是十分不够的。我们的技术工作，还残存着许多资产阶级的做法；某些技术人员的资产阶级的技术思想，也还没有彻底加以清算。这就使得他们的潜在力量，不能有效地发挥出来。这种情况，在过去的生产运动中已经充分表现出来，在国家大规模的经济建设开始以后，必将更为严重。
    为什么技术工作中的改革直到现在还是非常少呢？这是因为，有些技术人员还没有树立为人民服务的基本思想和工作态度，他们考虑的常常是个人的得失，而把整体利益置诸脑后。这样，他们自己的积极性和创造性就不能发挥出来，甚至当着别人提出新的工作倡议时，他们还要提出这样那样的莫名其妙的“理由”加以反对。去年，北京某建筑公司曾经准备在设计工作中实行类似的改进，但是，因为许多设计人员都愿意“自己搞一套”，不肯和别人集体工作，以致当时的改进工作的建议，根本未能实现。
    经过“三反”运动，许多技术人员的资产阶级思想受到了严格的批判，他们的发明创造，开始多起来。当然这并不是说技术人员中的资产阶级思想已被肃清，可以不再继续进行思想改造；恰恰相反，我们应该提倡在技术工作中进行各种改革，而在进行改革的时候，必须有领导地在技术人员中开展批评与自我批评，帮助技术人员克服各种妨害集体事业的个人打算。只有这样，才能使各种改进工作的建议得以顺利实现。
