    A Letter to Beloved Chairman Mao
    Workers of the Jiang'an Bridge Factory, Hankou Railway Sub-bureau
    Guarantee to Complete the Sluice Gates for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project on Schedule

    Beloved Chairman Mao: Our factory's "Three-Anti" Campaign has achieved a glorious victory. This movement has laid a solid foundation for the large-scale Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to come.

    During the "Three-Anti" Campaign, our factory accepted the glorious task of manufacturing ×× sluice gates for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Our factory has insufficient manpower, tools, and materials, but when we think of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project's impact on the lives of three million people and the harvest of seven million mu of fertile land, our confidence and determination increase. We use our brains, overcome difficulties, and improve production efficiency. For example, a certain team used to only be able to make 300 rivets per day, but now it has increased to 940; the mechanical group researched and manufactured a reamer for scraping large copper sleeves on the bottom of the gate, increasing work efficiency by 40 times; the welding team used to weld 85 meters of ten-centimeter-thick iron plate in a day, but now it has increased to 118 meters.

    On the afternoon of May 17th, Minister Fu Zuoyi of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Water Resources, on behalf of you, came to visit us and understand our work and living conditions. We sincerely thank you for your concern and care for us. We are determined to repay your concern with practical actions and guarantee the completion of the tasks assigned by the higher authorities on schedule. Under your wise leadership, we will do a good job in labor protection and hygiene and epidemic prevention, study hard, exercise our bodies, and strive to rapidly industrialize the country and realize socialism.
      The Entire Staff of the Jiang'an Bridge Factory, Hankou Railway Sub-bureau

    写给敬爱的毛主席
    汉口铁路分局江岸桥梁厂职工
    保证按期制成荆江分洪工程所用闸门
    敬爱的毛主席：我厂“三反”运动已经取得了辉煌的胜利。这个运动，给今后的大规模增产节约运动，打下了坚实的基础。
    在“三反”运动中，我厂接受了为荆江分洪工程制做××个闸门的光荣任务。我厂人力不够，工具材料也不够，但是，我们想到荆江分洪工程关系三百万人民的生活，关系七百万亩良田的收成，我们的信心和决心就提高了。我们开动脑筋，克服困难，提高了生产效率。如某班过去每天只能制三百个铆钉，现在已经提高到九百四十个；机械组研究、制造了一种刮闸底大铜套的绞刀，提高工作效率四十倍；电焊组烧十厘米厚的铁板，过去一天烧八十五公尺，现在提高到一百十八公尺。
    五月十七日下午，中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长代表您来慰问我们，了解我们的工作和生活情况。我们衷心感谢您对我们的关怀和爱护。我们决以实际行动来报答您对我们的关怀，保证按期完成上级所给的任务。我们要在您的英明领导下，作好劳动保护和卫生防疫工作，努力学习，锻炼身体，为使国家迅速走向工业化，实现社会主义而奋斗。
      汉口铁路分局江岸桥梁厂全体职工
