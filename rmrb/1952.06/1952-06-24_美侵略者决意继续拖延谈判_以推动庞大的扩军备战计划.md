Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 23rd: The American aggressors have openly announced their determination to continue stalling the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to use this method to push through a massive arms expansion and war preparations plan.

The former chief representative of the US side, Joy, who exhausted all means of delaying negotiations at Panmunjom, said to reporters upon returning to the United States that he "avoided predicting the future of the armistice negotiations" and only "repeatedly said: We will just stick to it like that" (United Press, San Francisco, June 19th). According to a report in the New York "Compass" on June 15th, Senator Taft, a Republican candidate, boasted during a conversation with New Jersey delegates attending the Republican convention on the 12th that time was "on our side" for the United States, and he said: In the Korean issue, "the best thing we can do is to drag on the truce talks." Another Republican presidential candidate, Eisenhower, also said on the 18th that "there is no quick and easy solution to the Korean War" (United Press, Denver, June 18th).

The American "Business Week" published on June 7th admitted that the reason the United States is delaying the armistice negotiations is to maintain the tense situation so that American monopolists can obtain greater profits in arms expansion and war preparations. The magazine said in its "Washington Outlook" column that since January of this year, because "the Korean armistice has been assumed to be a done deal," "the original defense plan has had a tendency to gradually slow down"; but "the development of unfavorable situations abroad is trending towards restoring previous ideas about the emergency situation." Therefore, the magazine said: "A push for a large-scale new defense plan is taking shape."

    美侵略者决意继续拖延谈判  以推动庞大的扩军备战计划
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美国侵略者公开宣布决心继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判，企图用这种办法来推动庞大的扩军备战计划。
    在板门店耍尽了拖延谈判手段的前美方首席代表乔埃，在回到美国之后对记者发表谈话时，“避不预料停战谈判的前途”，只是“一再说：我们就那样坚持下去”（合众社旧金山十九日电）。另据六月十五日纽约“指南针日报”报道，正在竞选的共和党参议员塔夫脱，十二日在和出席共和党大会的新泽西州代表谈话时，吹嘘时间对美国“有好处”，他说：在朝鲜问题上，“我们所能够做的最好的事情，便是在休战谈判中拖下去”。共和党的另一个总统竞选人艾森豪威尔也在十八日说，“朝鲜战争是没有迅速容易的解决办法的”（合众社丹佛十八日电）。
    六月七日出版的美国“商业周刊”承认美国之所以拖延停战谈判，是为了继续保持紧张局势，以便美国的垄断资本家们能在扩军备战中获取更大的利润。这本杂志在其“华府展望”栏中说：从今年一月以来，由于“朝鲜停战已经被假定为不成问题了”，“国防计划原有逐渐缓慢下来的趋势”；但是“现在国外不利形势的发展，正趋向着恢复以前关于紧急局势的想法”。因此，该杂志说：“一种对于大规模的新的国防计划的推动，正在形成中”。
