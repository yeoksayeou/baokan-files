Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, June 11th: British prisoners of war (POWs) held in the No. 1 POW camp and No. 5 POW camp in northern Korea have recently written letters to Alexander, the British Minister of Defence. The full text of these two letters is as follows:

    First letter

    We, the undersigned British prisoners of war in the No. 1 POW camp in North Korea, hereby submit the following statement to Viscount Alexander, the British Minister of Defence, who is reportedly now in South Korea.

    (1) We express our impatience that the achievement of a ceasefire agreement continues to be delayed due to one side's refusal to agree to the release of all prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.

    (2) We express our concern that the US military and South Korean army are reportedly massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and afterwards dispatched British troops to Geoje Island in an attempt to cover up those responsible for the situation there.

    (3) We believe that our interests and the interests of the British people would be better served if a British representative were immediately included in the delegation conducting ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom.

    (4) In view of the reported massacre on Geoje Island, we can understand that our families may fear that reprisals have been taken against UN forces' prisoners of war. We wish to inform them that no reprisals have been carried out in this POW camp. Our peaceful life here has not been disrupted by the Geoje Island incident, but we are uneasy about the impact of these events on delaying an agreement at Panmunjom.

    Second letter

    We, the undersigned British prisoners of war in the No. 5 POW camp in North Korea, hereby submit the following statement to Viscount Alexander, the British Minister of Defence, who is reportedly now in South Korea.

    (1) We protest that the achievement of a ceasefire agreement continues to be delayed due to one side's refusal to agree to the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention.

    (2) We protest that the US military and South Korean army are reportedly massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and afterwards directed British troops to Geoje Island in an attempt to cover up those responsible for the situation there.

    (3) We believe that our interests and the interests of the British people would be better served if a British representative were immediately included in the delegation conducting ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom.

    (4) In view of the reported massacre on Geoje Island, we can understand that our families may fear that reprisals have been taken against UN forces' prisoners of war. We wish to inform them that no reprisals have been carried out in this POW camp. Our peaceful life here has not been disrupted by the Geoje Island incident, but we are uneasy about the impact of these events on delaying an agreement at Panmunjom.

    The following 234 British POWs signed these two letters: T.H. Davies, D.C. Stocketin, R.C. Matthews, W. Bilbo, D. Lucas, E. Fawcett, B. Canavan, J. Cowell, J.C. Bolton, and E.J. Telford, among others.

    【新华社朝鲜北部某地十一日电】在朝鲜北部第一号战俘营和第五号战俘营的英国战俘，顷分别写信给英国国防部大臣亚历山大。这两封信的全文如下：
    第一封信
    我们下列签名的在北朝鲜的第一战俘营的英国战俘，谨将下列声明提给据传现在南朝鲜的英国国防部大臣亚历山大子爵。
    （一）据传由于一方拒绝同意依照日内瓦公约的规定释放全部战俘，致使停战谈判协议的达成继续延迟，对此我们表示我们的不耐。
    （二）据传美军与南朝鲜军对朝鲜与中国战俘进行屠杀，并事后派遣英国军队前往巨济岛，企图掩护应对那里的情况负责的人，对此我们表示关怀。
    （三）我们相信如果在板门店进行停战谈判的代表团中，立即包括一位英国代表，可以更好地服务于我们的利益以及英国人民的利益。
