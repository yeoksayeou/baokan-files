    Qingdao State-Owned No. 6 Cotton Mill Repair Department Workers
    Successfully Manufacture Air Cooler Tubes
    Comrade Editor: The employees of the repair department of the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, brought into play the creativity of the working class, and manufactured air cooler tubes. The air cooler tubes used in the factory's power plant were originally water-cooled finned tubes, and the water pipes had corroded. Last summer, the repair department accepted the task of trial-manufacturing cooler tubes. The workers in the department overcame many difficulties in the process of trial manufacture. A batch of seawater-corrosion-resistant copper tubes were stored in the warehouse. It was necessary to reduce one end of the copper tube and enlarge the other end, while maintaining the original thickness of the tube wall, in order to be able to utilize them. Worker Dong Fuxiang designed
    a set of models of different sizes, drew on the experience of cold working, expanded and contracted the tube ends to a certain size, and went through several annealing procedures to avoid hardening of the tube material. Manufacturing cooler tube copper fins was also a difficult task. It was necessary to roll copper wire into copper sheets of a certain thickness and width, and fold them into an "L" shape to wrap around the tube. Dong Fuxiang and others used waste materials to create a rolling mill to roll the copper wire into copper sheets of a certain size. He further made a set of ingenious edging winders to fold the copper sheets into an "L" shape and wrap them around the tubes. In this way, they finally completed the last step of the process and manufactured the cooler tubes.

    青岛国棉六厂修理部工人
    制造空气冷却器管成功
    编辑同志：国营青岛第六棉纺织厂修理部职工，发挥了工人阶级的创造性，制成了空气冷却器管。这个厂发电所用的空气冷却器管，原是水冷式翼型管，水管已经腐蚀。去年夏季，修理部接受了试制冷却器管的任务。该部工人在试制过程中克服了很多困难。仓库里存有一批耐海水腐蚀的紫铜管。必须把紫铜管的一端缩小，把另一端扩大，还要保持管壁的原来厚度，才能加以利用。工人董福祥设计好
    一付大小不同的模型，吸取冷做的经验，把管头涨缩成一定的尺寸，并经过几次退火的手续，以避免管子质地变硬。制造冷却器管铜翼也是一个艰难的工作。必须把铜丝碾成一定厚度和宽度的铜片，并折成“Ｌ”形，绕到管子上去。董福祥等利用废料配制成一套滚压机，把铜丝碾压成一定尺度的铜片。他又进一步做了一套巧妙的折边卷绕器，以便把铜片折成“Ｌ”形，绕到管子上。这样，他们终于完成了最后一步工序，制成了冷却器管。
