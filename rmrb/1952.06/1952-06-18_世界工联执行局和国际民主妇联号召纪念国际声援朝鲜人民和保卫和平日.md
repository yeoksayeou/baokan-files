    Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 17th: According to TASS, the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which closed in Vienna on the 14th, passed a resolution on commemorating June 25th, the International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace, stating: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions reiterates the declaration of the World Federation of Trade Unions, calling on all trade union organizations, working men and women to commemorate the International Day of Active Solidarity with the heroic Korean people and Defense of Peace on June 25th this year under a united front. On June 25th this year, working people and peace committees will demand a peaceful settlement of the Korean question on a fair and reasonable basis, demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea; demand an unconditional ban on weapons of mass destruction and condemn the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons on the Korean front and in Northeast China; and demand the exposure of the inhuman and despicable retaliatory acts of the American military officers in the prisoner-of-war camps where Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are detained. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that in commemorating June 25th this year, working men and women around the world will show courage and initiative in all aspects, thereby strengthening the ranks of peace fighters around the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 17th: The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a declaration on the second anniversary of the Korean War, stating: June 25, 1952, marks the second anniversary of the Korean War. For two years, American interventionists, under the banner of the United Nations, have vainly attempted to crush the heroic resistance of the Korean people by using the most vicious and inhuman methods of warfare. In addition to the systematic destruction of Korea, indiscriminate bombing, the use of napalm bombs, and the massacre of civilians, they have now added an even more sinister crime: bacteriological warfare.
    Women around the world have stood at the forefront of the struggle to stop the war. But we must do more. If we do not do everything in our power to end the war, the suffering endured by Korean mothers may befall us tomorrow. Korean women, together with the entire Korean people, have fought with unwavering heroism over the past two years to defend their national independence, the lives and happiness of their children. Let us show our support for Korean women with practical actions.
    The International Democratic Women's Federation calls on all women and all women's organizations:
    Urgently launch a coherent, continuous, and sustained movement to demand an end to bacteriological warfare and force an immediate cessation of the Korean War;
    Turn June 25th into a particularly active day, bringing the movement to a new climax, on which day women around the world will unanimously express their will to achieve peace;
    Send delegations to meet with their governments and American embassies and consulates, sending them a large number of letters, telegrams, and petitions;
    Organize rallies and demonstrations under the slogan: "The Korean War has lasted two years, women! Unite and take action to stop the bloodshed immediately!"

    世界工联执行局和国际民主妇联号召纪念国际声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：十四日在维也纳闭幕的世界工会联合会执行局会议通过关于纪念六月二十五日国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日的决议说：世界工联执行局重申世界工联的宣言，号召所有工会组织、劳动男女在一个联合阵线下纪念国际积极声援英勇的朝鲜人民与保卫和平日。在今年六月二十五日，劳动人民与和平委员会将要求在公正合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜；要求无条件禁止大规模毁灭的武器和谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜前线和中国东北使用细菌武器的罪行；要求揭发美国军事长官在拘留朝中战俘的战俘营中的不人道的和卑鄙的报复行为。世界工联执行局相信，在今年纪念六月二十五日时，全世界劳动男女将显出勇气和各方面的主动性，从而加强全世界和平战士的阵线。
    【新华社十七日讯】柏林消息：国际民主妇女联合会发表关于朝鲜战争二周年的宣言说：一九五二年六月二十五日，是朝鲜战争二周年的日子。两年来，美国干涉者打着联合国的旗帜，用了最毒辣的非人道的战争手段，枉然地企图摧毁朝鲜人民的英勇抵抗。除了有计划地毁灭朝鲜、滥炸、施用汽油弹、屠杀平民之外，现在他们又增加了一样更恶毒的罪行：进行细菌战。
    全世界妇女都已站到了制止战争的斗争的最前列。但是，我们还要做更多的事。要是我们不尽一切力量终止战争，朝鲜母亲所身受的种种苦难，明天就可能降临到我们的头上。朝鲜妇女在过去两年中以不屈不挠的英勇精神，和全体朝鲜人民一起进行斗争，保卫他们的民族独立、保卫他们孩子的生命和幸福。让我们以实际的行动来表示我们对于朝鲜妇女的支持。
    国际民主妇女联合会号召全体妇女和一切妇女团体：
    急切地展开一个连贯性的、经常的和持久的运动，要求终止细菌战并迫使朝鲜战争立即停止；
    把六月二十五日变成一个特别活跃的日子，使运动推进到新的高潮，在那一天使全世界的妇女一致表示她们要求实现和平的意志；
    派代表团去会见本国政府和美国大使馆和领事馆，大量向它们发出信件、电报和请愿书；
    在“朝鲜战争已两年了，妇女们！团结起来，行动起来，立即制止流血惨剧！”的口号下，组织集会和示威。
