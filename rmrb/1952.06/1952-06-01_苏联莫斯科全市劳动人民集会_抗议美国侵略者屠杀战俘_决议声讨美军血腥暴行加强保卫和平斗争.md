Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th: On May 29th, the people of Moscow held a city-wide rally in the Pillar Hall of the House of Trade Unions to protest angrily against the atrocities committed by the American aggressors against captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Among those present were prominent scientists, writers, artists, industrial workers, students, and representatives of the All-Soviet and Moscow City Peace Committees, the Red Cross, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, and other people's organizations. Professor Kozhevnikov, a famous Soviet authority on international law, Dr. Devonichenko, Chairman of the Moscow Red Cross, Romanov, foreman of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant, Sirazhdinov, a scientist at the Institute of Mathematics, Fokina, a female worker at the "Red Warrior" Factory, and the writer Surkov all delivered passionate speeches protesting against the heinous crimes committed by the American interventionists on Geoje Island and in Busan. Academician Petrovsky, President of Moscow University, presided over the meeting and delivered a brief opening speech, saying: News of the bloody atrocities committed by the American aggressors on Geoje Island and in Busan has spread throughout the world. The American interventionists have completely lost their humanity, trampled on all standards of human ethics, and blatantly disregarded all the international agreements they themselves had signed. All progressive mankind feels boundless indignation at this new crime of theirs.

	President of Moscow University's opening address
	Exposing the Bloody Atrocities of the American Criminals

	The people of China and Korea call Geoje Island in South Korea, where the POW camps are located, the Island of Death. On this island, torture, ill-treatment, and massacres of prisoners of war are endless. Bacteriological and chemical laboratories have been established here, where live human beings are used to test poisons, plague, cholera, and other infectious diseases.
	The American criminals are trying to detain captured soldiers in order to massacre or enslave them. The events on Geoje Island clearly demonstrate that hidden beneath the proposal for so-called "voluntary" repatriation is an inhumane desire to detain tens of thousands of prisoners of war by means of intimidation, violence, torture, and the massacre of staunch and unyielding people, depriving them of their legitimate right to return home and resume peaceful labor.
	The American aggressors have tried to conceal the facts of the maltreatment of prisoners of war, but the truth cannot be hidden from world opinion. Today, the word "Geoje Island" is already being placed alongside such horrific words as "Auschwitz" and "Maidanek." The crimes committed by the American aggressors against unarmed people who fall into their hands are even worse than those of the Hitlerite devils. This is their "civilization," this is their "humanity," the "civilization" and "humanity" they clamor for, boast about, and bring to the people of other countries.
	The Soviet people, like all progressive mankind, express boundless anger at the insane crimes committed by the American army against captured personnel from Korea and China. We condemn this shameful crime and demand that it be stopped.
	We demand an end to the aggression in Korea, and that the Korean people be given the freedom to build their own peaceful and constructive lives.
	Academician Petrovsky then invited Professor Kozhevnikov, Doctor of Law, to speak.

	Speech by Professor Kozhevnikov, Doctor of Law
	Denouncing the United States for Violating the Principles of International Law

	Professor Kozhevnikov said: The American army's ferocious attack on Korea is a monstrous act of aggression. From the standpoint of universally recognized standards and principles of international law, aggression is the most serious crime against humanity.
	The American imperialists, who are carrying out unprecedented acts of aggression against the peace-loving Korean people, have, in their criminal acts of intervention, flagrantly trampled upon all principles of international law, the recognized laws of war, and the most basic principles of human morality.
	The atrocities of the American interventionists in Korea far exceed the most brutal crimes committed by the Hitlerite bandits in World War II. The American aggressors have begun to systematically use barbarous bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China to massacre the people on a large scale, brazenly violating the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925. This international law strictly prohibits the use of asphyxiating gases and other similar gases and bacteriological weapons in war, and considers that all countries should abide by this prohibition according to conscience and custom.
	Now the whole world is shocked and outraged by the new bloody crimes of the American aggressors, and by their crimes against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The American interventionists have shamelessly violated the most basic principles of treating prisoners of war, which have been traditionally respected for centuries.
	The current system of treating prisoners of war is strictly regulated in the Hague Convention of 1907, the Geneva Convention of 1929, and the Geneva Convention of 1949. These three conventions fix the corresponding international legal standards that had previously become customary.
	The Chapter on Land Warfare Regulations and Customs in the Hague Convention of 1907, which was signed and ratified by the United States, clearly states: Prisoners of war should be treated humanely. According to the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, on the improvement of the wounded and sick in armies in the field, belligerents receiving wounded and sick prisoners of war shall give humane treatment and care to wounded and sick prisoners of war regardless of nationality (Article 1).
	The Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, concerning the treatment of prisoners of war, which was also signed by representatives of the United States, states: Prisoners of war must be treated humanely at all times. It is forbidden for any country detaining prisoners of war to commit any illegal act or inaction that results in the death of prisoners of war in its hands, or seriously endangers their health, and any such act will be regarded as a serious violation of the current convention.
	Specifically, prisoners of war must never be subjected to physical mutilation, or any kind of scientific or medical experiment...At all times, prisoners of war shall be protected, and in particular shall be protected against all acts of violence or intimidation...It is forbidden to repress them (Article 13). The American aggressors have trampled upon the standards of international law with indescribable arrogance.
	Kozhevnikov continued: The unbearable tragedy of prisoners of war on Geoje Island - the "Island of Death" - is caused by the heinous crimes of the American imperialists. The horrific situation of the 80,000 prisoners of war detained on the island, the undeniable evidence and documents proving this situation, is now known throughout the world. This island has become a veritable hell. There, brutal abuse, inhumane torture and massacres of prisoners of war are commonplace. They brand prisoners of war with red-hot irons; they hang prisoners of war upside down and pour water into their nostrils. In secret American laboratories, prisoners of war are used as experimental subjects to test new poisons and bacteria that cause infectious diseases. The horrors of Auschwitz, Maidanek, and Buchenwald have been revived on Geoje Island!
	Everyone knows that Koje Island former POW camp commander Colson confessed to the world that Americans are carrying out bloody repression against prisoners of war. But even if he did not admit it, we have thousands and hundreds of pieces of conclusive evidence, the testimony of hundreds of people who have experienced this horrific encounter and managed to escape this "Island of Death", and the reports of dozens of reporters from various newspapers, all of which undeniably confirm these inhumane abuses and atrocities.
	In addition to ferociously violating all the above provisions of international conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, the American aggressors are now putting forward an absolutely unfounded condition in the form of an ultimatum in the Korean armistice negotiations that completely violates international law and humanitarian principles, namely the so-called "voluntary" repatriation of prisoners of war.
	The immediate repatriation of all prisoners of war after the end of hostilities is a recognized principle of current international law.
	The above principle can be found in several international conventions on the issue of prisoners of war.
	The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, as well as the Geneva Conventions on Prisoners of War of 1929 and 1949, all stipulate the principle of complete and unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war after the end of hostilities.
	The only exception to this principle stipulated in the above conventions is the detention of prisoners of war who have been charged with crimes, or prisoners of war who have been executed for crimes.
	Although the United States is a signatory to the Hague Convention on Prisoners of War of 1907 and the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War of 1929, and although it signed the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War of 1949, the American interventionists flagrantly violated the principle of unconditional repatriation of prisoners of war. Everyone knows that the obligations regarding prisoners of war assumed by the United States in accordance with the above conventions were confirmed by the country in July 1951, when the US government declared in a special letter from US Representative to the United Nations Austin to the Secretary-General that the US military in Korea would faithfully abide by these conventions.
	However, regardless of the above conventions, the US side in the Korean armistice negotiations advocated exchanging prisoners of war based on a one-to-one principle, obviously attempting to detain more than 160,000 people out of all 170,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Later, the US side put forward the so-called "voluntary" repatriation proposal, the sole purpose of which was to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations, delay and expand the war in the Far East, and increase the threat of a new world war.
	The American interventionists cruelly and savagely tortured and abused prisoners of war, tattooed them, and attempted to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in order to hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs, preparing to use them as cannon fodder to realize their plan to expand the war. The Americans used bayonets and the most barbaric atrocities against prisoners of war to carry out their so-called "screening".
	This extremely heinous large-scale abuse by the American aggressors has aroused angry protests and unanimous indignation from all peace-loving people.
	According to the principles of international law recognized by the Nuremberg Tribunal Regulations in 1945 and confirmed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, ordinary people around the world demand that Ridgway, Dodd, Bonner and others who have committed crimes against peace and humanity in Korea be brought to trial before the people.
	We Soviet people also strongly support such demands.
	We demand unconditional compliance with all existing international agreements and obligations. We cannot allow anyone to commit crimes against humanity with impunity.
	Professor Kozhevnikov concluded: The executioners have completely lost their humanity and degenerated into beasts, and peace-loving people must stop them, and they will surely be able to stop them.

	Chairman of the Moscow Red Cross Speaks
	Condemns the Accomplice Behavior of the International Committee of the Red Cross

	The next speaker was Dr. Devonichenko, Chairman of the Moscow Red Cross City Committee.
	She said: Comrades!
	Red Cross organizations operate in various countries and unite hundreds of millions of people of all races and nationalities, various beliefs and political views. They have a responsibility to foster among their members feelings of humane treatment of humanity, and to provide material, medical and other assistance, and provide spiritual support in the event of natural disasters and during wars. They care for the sick and injured, and protect the human rights of prisoners of war (regardless of which army or country they belong to). The Red Cross organizations have actively participated in the formulation of all international agreements on humane methods of warfare (including humane treatment of prisoners of war and protecting civilians from the horrors of war).
	Red Cross organizations throughout the world have a responsibility to closely monitor that all governments and all belligerents in any war unconditionally comply with the universally recognized rules for conducting wars in a humane manner, treating civilians and prisoners of war humanely, and international agreements on these issues.
	The Soviet Red Cross organization, just like all Soviet people who are nurtured with the socialist spirit of humanism, deep respect for humanity, and friendly cooperation with all nations and countries, firmly opposes any manifestation of inhuman treatment of humanity.
	We deeply hate the outrageous crimes committed by the American aggressors against captured personnel from China and Korea in the POW camps on Geoje Island and near Busan recently for this reason.
	These crimes of the American aggressors violate all international standards for the treatment of prisoners of war established by international agreements - especially the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions signed in 1929 and 1949, which stipulate humane treatment of prisoners of war.
	All peace-loving people in the world unanimously demand an end to this crime. Members of Red Cross organizations in all countries, together with the people of all countries, unanimously put forward this demand, because protecting the human rights of prisoners of war is their sacred duty.
	However, in this truly international chorus of protest, the voice of the so-called Red Cross "International" Committee is not heard. This committee, which calls itself "International" and consists of nineteen Swiss bankers and manufacturers who are closely linked to and serve US monopoly capitalists, has concealed this unprecedented crime of abuse of prisoners of war by maintaining silence, as it did during World War II. During World War II, this committee did not say a word of condemnation for the heinous crimes committed by the Hitlerites in the death camps of Maidanek, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald. Today, it also does not say a word of opposition to the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors in the death camps of Geoje Island and Busan. At that time, this committee investigated Hitler's POW camps and shamelessly talked about improving the work of showing movies and performing plays in the death camps. Today, after sending representatives to the death camps on Geoje Island, the same committee shamelessly only talked about insufficient rations and some prisoners of war's shoes being tattered, and it did not say a word to express its attitude towards the facts of torture, shooting and beatings in the Korean American POW camps, which all honest people know.
	Fortunately, this committee, which calls itself the Red Cross "International" Committee, does not represent the will of members of Red Cross organizations in all countries around the world.
	The 1.5 million members of the Red Cross in Moscow City and Moscow Oblast firmly believe that the will of the people of all countries around the world will surely rescue the captured personnel from China and Korea from the brutal treatment they are suffering in the hands of the criminal American soldiers.
	Law, justice and humanity will surely triumph over arrogance and atrocities.
	The criminals and their accomplices will surely be put in shackles and severely punished.

	Romanov, foreman of the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant, expressed infinite anger at the atrocities and crimes of the American imperialists. This veteran worker expressed friendly solidarity and deep love for the defenders of Korea. He said: We demand that the American imperialists stop their atrocities in Korea and stop the brutal plundering war against the Korean people. We firmly demand that the American secret police must stop their abuse of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

	Sirazhdinov, a scientist at the Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his speech that the inhuman atrocities and barbaric terror inflicted by American soldiers on Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the POW camps on Geoje Island and in Busan have aroused deep anger among the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. He said: For millions of men and women all over the world, Geoje Island and Busan are no longer just geographical names in the Korean Strait region. Today they are linked to the evil names of Maidanek, Buchenwald and Auschwitz.

	Next, Fokina, a female worker at the "Red Warrior" Factory, spoke.
	She said: When we think of the American imperialists using evil weapons of mass slaughter against the peace-loving Korean people who are defending the freedom and independence of their motherland, anger surges in our hearts. The despicable crimes of the American soldiers are indeed endless. For us Soviet men and women who still clearly remember the difficult war years of resisting the fascist aggressors, the suffering and worries of the Korean people are very dear and understandable.

	Speech by Prominent Soviet Poet Surkov
	Condemns Acheson for Shamelessly Denying His Crimes

	The famous Soviet poet Surkov delivered a moving speech. He said: Today, the anger in our hearts has brought us all here to meet.
	It has been almost two years since the American imperialists, under the guise of the United Nations flag, began to attack the peace-loving Korean people and engage in their bloody deeds on Korean land.
	During this period, the American aggressors have committed many evils on the much-suffering Korean land.
	They have turned hundreds of cities and glorious monuments of ancient culture into ruins. They have swept away lush gardens from the earth, burned crops with napalm bombs, and destroyed thousands upon thousands of peaceful villages.
	The American interventionists, angered by military failures, vented their anger on peaceful residents, causing millions of children, women and the elderly to die or become disabled.
	These executioners, who boast of a non-existent racial superiority and boast of the notorious superiority of the American way of life, have committed crimes that are more brutal and cruel than the most terrible crimes of their predecessors, the Hitlerite murderers.
	News of the unprecedented atrocities that occurred in the American POW camps where soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were housed has spread throughout the world.
	Now everyone knows what kind of torture and abuse the American aggressors used, vainly trying to make unarmed people abandon their motherland and become traitors.
	Former American POW camp commanders on Geoje Island, Colson and Dodd, publicly confirmed the scandals and crimes committed by the American interventionists on Geoje Island. They were demoted, but they were punished not because they committed bloody crimes, but because they admitted these facts, they opened the curtain and exposed the outrageous atrocities being committed against POWs from China and Korea.
	The American imperialists have no intention of stopping the abuse and persecution of POWs from China and Korea. This can be clearly seen from the statement of the new commander of the Geoje Island POW camp, American Brigadier General Bonner. Bonner said that he intends to take severe measures against prisoners of war in the future. He said that he intends to make prisoners of war realize that the United States is strong, and it would be too optimistic to hope that he can restore control without causing bloodshed. Tens of thousands of unarmed people in the POW camps in South Korea are in danger of being killed. Only a massive protest from peace-loving people all over the world can stop the new crimes of the American aggressors and save the lives of thousands of people.
	I want to loudly protest against the American interventionists' outrageous crimes of taking bloody revenge against POWs from China and Korea on Geoje Island and using bacteriological weapons against Korean civilians, and I cannot fail to mention the recent statement made by US Secretary of State Acheson.
	Acheson attempted to slander the people's angry protests against the American army's crimes of using bacteriological weapons in Korea and bloodily massacring POWs from China and Korea, saying that these protests are a movement to "slander" the United States and "incite hatred" against the United States.
	The people of the whole world know that it is the American ruling group that, through their spokesman Acheson, rejected all proposals to ban bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter of people. They know that it is the United States that refused to support the Geneva Protocol declaring bacteriological weapons illegal.
	Official spokespersons of the US government - including Secretary of State Acheson - have repeatedly denied that the US military has used bacteriological weapons. But none of them has condemned the use of bacteriological weapons, and none of them has supported the people's demand to condemn bacteriological warfare as a despicable and inhumane act.
	Everyone knows that it was not the United States but the Soviet Union that proposed the conclusion of a peace pact among the five major powers, and this proposal was also rejected by the United States.
	The people of all countries know that it is not the United States but the Soviet Union that is persistently struggling to safeguard and consolidate world peace, establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and end the occupation of Germany; while the United States is splitting Germany and establishing a springboard for military aggression against all peace-loving countries in the heart of Europe.
	Therefore, Acheson, who cannot deny the bloody crimes committed by the American interventionists in Korea as evidenced by documents and witnesses' testimonies, attempts to slander the peace-loving people who protest against these crimes as being hostile to the American people. The real purpose of Acheson's many statements falsely claiming that peace-loving people are "slandering" the United States is to cover up the evil conspiracy that the American imperialists are preparing to launch a new world war.
	Everyone knows that peace-loving countries have never confused the American imperialists who instigated aggression and organized unspeakable atrocities in Korea with the peace-loving American people who not long ago fought side by side with the people of Asia and Europe against the fascist plague.
	The Soviet people, like all honest men and women in the world, will carry out the struggle with ever-increasing determination to defend peace. They warmly support the just cause of the glorious Korean defenders and angrily protest against the bloody crimes of the American aggressors and their accomplices in aggression. They demand an immediate end to the Korean War and severely punish the war criminals.

	The Conference Passes a Resolution
	Calls to Stop the Crimes of the American Aggressors

	The resolution passed by the Moscow City Laboring People's Conference is as follows:
	We, the representatives of the Moscow laboring people - workers, staff, scientists, artists and cultural workers - held a city-wide rally, and along with tens of millions of men and women around the world, condemn the unprecedented bloody atrocities that the American aggressors have been carrying out in the Korean POW camps.
	These crimes are another heinous atrocity committed by the American imperialists following their recent use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and northern China. The fact that the American ruling group has not to this day condemned the use of such barbaric means of mass slaughter proves that they hope to continue to use such despicable and inhumane weapons in the future.
	Now, the American imperialists have once again trampled on the principles of human morality and all standards of international law. The American interventionists violated the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, turning the POW camps on Geoje Island and other places in Korea into death camps, which are no different from Hitler's death camps in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Maidanek.
	In these POW camps, they implemented a bloody rule of abuse, humiliation, barbaric beatings, and mass shootings of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.
	In the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors put forward the condition of so-called "voluntary" repatriation of prisoners of war, which is extremely contrary to international law and humanitarian principles.
	The American aggressors put forward such a condition with the intention of disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing and expanding the war of aggression in the Far East, and strengthening the threat of a new world war. To this end, they used the most cruel atrocities to force tens of thousands of prisoners of war to join the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Syngman Rhee gang, who are mortal enemies of the Chinese and Korean people, and serve as their cannon fodder.
	The American interventionists have been caught on the spot, and undeniable evidence and documents have proven their crimes, exposing them before the people of the world. However, the American imperialists are openly preparing to implement new barbaric suppression against the prisoners of war on Geoje Island. The conscience and honor of the people of the world cannot tolerate such heinous crimes by the American interventionists.
	Honest men and women in all countries and all progressive humanity condemn this recent outrageous behavior of the American interventionists and demand that the American military stop the massacre of POWs from China and Korea.
	The Moscow laboring people, like all the people of the Soviet Union, express boundless indignation and vehement protests against the inhumane crimes committed by the American imperialists in Korea.
	We, along with the progressive forces of the world, demand that the American aggressors stop such atrocities in Korea. We demand that POWs from China and Korea be given humane treatment and that the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war be observed impartially.
	The Moscow laboring people, like all Soviet men and women, also express warm fraternal solidarity with the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are heroically fighting against American aggression.
	The laboring people have a sacred responsibility to further increase their vigilance, constantly expose the conspiracies of the instigators of a new imperialist war, and strengthen the struggle for world peace.
	The Moscow laboring people, together with all the Soviet people, will continue to persistently struggle for peace and resolutely strengthen the power of their socialist country with selfless patriotic labor.
	Long live our Soviet motherland - the bastion of world peace!
	Long live our great leader and teacher, dear Comrade Stalin!

    苏联莫斯科全市劳动人民集会
    抗议美国侵略者屠杀战俘
    决议声讨美军血腥暴行加强保卫和平斗争
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：五月二十九日，莫斯科人民在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了一个全市性的集会，愤怒地抗议美国侵略者对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的暴行。出席者有著名的科学家、作家、艺术家、产业工人、学生、全苏及莫斯科市和平委员会、红十字会、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会及其他人民团体的代表。苏联著名国际法权威科热夫尼科夫教授、莫斯科红十字会会长德伏尼诚科医师、“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂领班罗曼诺夫、数学研究所科学家西拉日丁诺夫、“红色壮士”工厂女工福金娜和作家苏尔科夫都发表了热烈的演说，抗议美国干涉者在巨济岛和釜山的滔天罪行。莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士主持大会，他发表了简短的开会词说：关于美国侵略者在巨济岛和釜山的血腥暴行的消息，已经传遍了全世界。美国干涉者已经完全丧失了人性，蹂躏一切人类伦理标准，并且公然不顾一切地破坏他们曾经亲自签署的种种国际协议。全体进步人类对他们这种新的罪行莫不感到无比的愤慨。
    莫斯科大学校长致开会词
    揭露美国罪犯们的血腥暴行
    中朝两国人民把战俘营所在地的南朝鲜巨济岛叫作死亡岛。在这个岛上，酷刑虐待和大批屠杀战俘的事情层出不穷。这里已经建立起了细菌和化学实验室，毒气、鼠疫、霍乱和其他疫病的病菌都在这里用活人来试验。
    美国罪犯们力图扣留被俘士兵，以便屠杀他们或奴役他们。巨济岛的事件清楚地表明：在关于所谓
    “自愿”遣返的建议下，隐藏着这样一种不人道的愿望，就是：用恫吓、暴力、酷刑和屠杀坚贞不屈的人们的方法，扣留几万战俘，剥夺他们回家恢复和平劳动的合法权利。
    美国侵略者曾经企图掩饰虐待战俘的事实，可是事实真相是瞒不过世界舆论的。今天，“巨济岛”这一个字眼已经与“奥斯威辛”和“麦丹尼克”等恐怖的字眼并列起来了。美国侵略者对于落在他们手中的手无寸铁的人们所犯下的罪行，和希特勒恶魔们比起来，有过之无不及。这就是他们的“文明”，这就是他们的“人道”，就是他们所叫嚣、所吹嘘、所带给别国人民的“文明”和“人道”。
    苏联人民与全体进步人类一样，对美国军队对朝鲜和中国的被俘人员所干下的这种疯狂罪行，一致表示无比的愤怒。我们声讨这种可耻的罪行，要求停止这种可耻的罪行。
    我们要求停止在朝鲜的侵略，要求给朝鲜人民以自由建设自己的和平建设生活的机会。
    彼得罗夫斯基院士随后就请法学博士科热夫尼科夫教授发言。
    法学博士科热夫尼科夫发言
    痛斥美国破坏国际公法的原则
    科热夫尼科夫教授说：美国的军队穷凶极恶地进攻朝鲜，美国已犯下了滔天的侵略罪行。从举世公认的国际公法标准与原则的立场来说，侵略是违反人道的最严重的罪行。
    对爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行空前的侵略暴行的美帝国主义者，在他们的罪恶干涉行为中，已经蛮横地蹂躏了所有国际公法的原则、公认的战争法规和人类道德的最基本原则。
    美国干涉者在朝鲜的暴行已远超过希特勒匪帮在第二次世界大战中犯下的最残酷的罪行。美国侵略者开始在朝鲜与中国东北有计划地使用野蛮的细菌武器，以大规模屠杀人民，他们悍然破坏了一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。这个国际法严禁在战争中使用窒息性毒气和其他类似的毒气和细菌武器，并认为根据良知与习惯，所有国家都应该遵守这个禁令。
    现在全世界对于美国侵略者的新的血腥罪行，对于他们对待朝鲜与中国战俘的罪行，都大为震惊和愤怒。美国干涉者已无耻地破坏了几世纪以来传统尊重的对待战俘的最基本原则。
    目前的战俘待遇制度在一九零七年海牙公约、一九二九年的日内瓦公约和一九四九年的日内瓦公约中，均有严格规定。这三个公约把以前成为惯例的相应的国际法标准固定下来。
    经美国签字和批准的一九零七年海牙公约中关于陆战法规及惯例章程明白指出：应给战俘以人道待遇。按照一九二九年七月二十七日关于改善战场上的军队伤病者的日内瓦公约，收容伤病战俘的交战方面应不分国籍给伤病战俘以人道之待遇及护养
    （第一条）。
    同样经过美国代表签字的一九四九年八月十二日的关于对战俘的待遇的日内瓦公约说：无论何时，均应给战俘以人道待遇。禁止拘留战俘的国家有任何非法行为或毫无作为，致使战俘在其手中死亡，或严重危及战俘的健康，任何此种行为均将视为严重违犯现行公约。
    具体地说，决不能使战俘遭受肉体的残害，或任何性质的科学或医学试验……无论何时，均应保护战俘，特别应保护他们不受一切暴力或恫吓行为的危害……禁止对他们实行镇压（第十三条）。美国侵略者以无法形容的侮慢态度蹂躏了国际法的标准。
    科热夫尼科夫又说：巨济岛——“死亡之岛”——上战俘的令人不忍卒睹的悲剧，是美帝国主义者的骇人罪行造成的。被拘留在岛上的八万名战俘处于一种骇人的情况之下，足以证明这种情况的无法抵赖的证据和文件，现在已是举世皆知的了。这个岛已经变成了一个名副其实的地狱了。在那里，残暴的虐待、对于战俘的不人道的酷刑和屠杀已是司空见惯的了。他们用烧红的熨斗烙烫战俘；把战俘倒悬起来，向战俘的鼻孔里灌水。在秘密的美国实验室里，战俘被当作试验品，来试验新式毒药和引起传染病的细菌。奥斯威辛、麦丹尼克和布痕瓦尔德的恐怖状况又在巨济岛上复活了！
    大家知道，巨济岛前战俘营长官柯尔生向全世界供认了，美国人正对战俘进行血腥的镇压。但即使他不承认，我们也有成千成百件确凿无误的证据、千百名经历过这种恐怖遭遇而又侥幸逃出了这个“死亡之岛”的人们的证言以及各报几十位记者的报道，这些记者全都令人无法抵赖地证实了这些不人道的虐待行为和暴行。
    美国侵略者们除了穷凶极恶地破坏了国际公约关于战俘待遇的上述一切规定以外，现在又在朝鲜停战谈判中间以最后通牒的形式提出了一个完全违背国际法和人道原则的绝对没有根据的条件，这就是所谓“自愿”遣返战俘。
    在敌对行动结束后立即遣返全部战俘，是公认的现行国际法的原则。
    上述原则可以见诸若干关于战俘问题的国际公约。
    一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约，以及一九二九年和一九四九年关于战俘问题的日内瓦公约，都规定了在敌对行动结束后完全地、无条件地遣返全部战俘的原则。
    上述公约所规定的这种原则的唯一例外，就是可以拘押已经被提出罪行诉讼的战俘，或者因犯了罪行而被处刑的战俘。
    虽然美国是一九零七年关于战俘问题的海牙公约和一九二九年关于战俘问题的日内瓦公约的签字国家，虽然它在一九四九年关于战俘问题的日内瓦公约上签了字，然而美国干涉者悍然破坏无条件遣返战俘的原则。大家知道，美国依照上述公约所承担的关于战俘的义务曾由该国在一九五一年七月加以确认，当时美国政府在美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀致秘书长的一封特别信件中宣称：在朝美军将忠实地遵守这些公约。
    然而，不顾上述种种公约，美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中主张根据一对一的原则交换战俘，显然企图在全部十七万多名朝中战俘中拘留十六万多人。后来，美国方面提出了所谓“自愿”遣返的建议，其唯一目的是想破坏朝鲜停战谈判，拖延和扩大远东的战争，增加爆发新世界大战的威胁。
    美国干涉者残酷野蛮地拷问和虐待战俘，在他们身上刺字，企图以暴力拘留朝中战俘，以便把他们交给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮，准备利用他们充当炮灰，实现其扩大战争的计划。美国人借着枪刺和对待战俘的最野蛮暴行，进行他们的所谓“甄别”。
    美国侵略者这种罪大恶极的大规模虐待，激起了全体爱好和平的人民的愤怒抗议和一致的愤慨。
    根据一九四五年为纽伦堡法庭法规所承认、并于一九四六年十二月十一日为联合国大会所确认的国际法原则，全世界普通人民要求把李奇微、杜德、波纳等在朝鲜犯了反和平及反人道罪行的人交到人民面前审讯。
    我们苏联人民也有力地支持这样的要求。
    我们要求无条件地遵守一切现存的国际协议和义务。我们不能容许任何人犯下对人类的罪行，而不受惩罚。
    科热夫尼科夫教授最后说：刽子手们已经完全丧失了人性，而堕落成为野兽，爱好和平的人民必须制止他们，而且也一定能够制止他们。
    莫斯科红十字会会长发言
    谴责红十字国际委员会帮凶行为
    下一个发言的是莫斯科红十字会市委员会会长、医师德伏尼诚科。
    她说：同志们！
    红十字组织是在各国工作的，并且团结着一切种族与民族、各种信仰与政见的亿万人民，它们有责任在它们的成员之间培养以人道态度对待人类的感情，并在发生自然灾害时、在战争时提供物质的、医药的及其他援助，并给予精神支持。它们照顾生病的人和受伤的人，并保卫战俘（不管他们属于那一个军队或那一个国家）的人权。红十字组织曾经积极参加制订关于以人道方法进行战争（包括以人道对待战俘和保护平民使之免遭战争恐怖）的一切国际协定。
    全世界红十字组织有责任严密注意一切政府和任何战争中的一切交战国无条件地遵守普遍公认的以人道方法进行战争、以人道对待平民与战俘的规则，以及关于这些问题的国际协定。
    苏联红十字组织，正和以社会主义人道精神、深切地尊敬人类的精神、对一切民族与国家保持友爱合作的精神教养起来的全体苏联人民一样，坚决地反对任何以不人道的态度对待人类的表现。
    我们之所以深切痛恨美国侵略者最近在巨济岛上和釜山附近的战俘营中对朝中两国被俘人员所犯下的滔天罪行，就是因为这个原因。
    美国侵略者的这种罪行，是违背国际协定——特别是规定以人道对待战俘的一九零七年海牙公约和先后在一九二九年和一九四九年签订的日内瓦公约——所确立的对待战俘的一切国际标准的。
    全世界一切爱好和平的人民一致要求停止这种罪行。全世界各国的红十字组织的会员们，与各国人民一道，一致提出这种要求，因为保卫战俘的人权，是他们的神圣职责。
    可是，在这个真正是国际一致的抗议声中，听不到所谓红十字“国际”委员会的声音。这一个由十九个与美国垄断资本家有着密切联系并且是为他们服务的瑞士银行家和制造商所组成的自命为“国际”委员会的委员会，和它在第二次世界大战中一样，以保持缄默的方法，隐蔽了这种史无前例的虐待战俘的罪行。在第二次世界大战期间，这个委员会对于希特勒分子在麦丹尼克、奥斯威辛、布痕瓦尔德等死亡营中所犯下的滔天罪行，根本没有说一句责备的话。今天，它对于美国侵略者在巨济岛和釜山死亡营中所犯下的滔天罪行，也根本不说一句反对的话。在那个时候，这个委员会调查了希特勒的战俘营以后，仅恬不知耻地谈了一些应改进死亡营中放映电影和演戏工作的话。今天，这个委员会在派遣代表到巨济岛死亡营中去了一趟以后，同样恬不知耻地仅谈了一些配给的食粮不够和有些战俘的鞋子破烂了等话，而对于一切正直人民都洞悉的朝鲜美国战俘营中的令人发指的酷刑、枪击和毒打等事实，它根本不说一句话来表示它的态度。
    所幸这一个自命为红十字“国际”委员会的委员会丝毫不代表全世界各国红十字组织的会员的意志。
    莫斯科市和莫斯科州的红十字会的一百五十万会员坚决地相信：全世界各国人民的意志，必定会营救朝中两国的被俘人员脱离他们在罪恶的美国军人手中所遭受的残暴待遇。
    法律、正义和人道一定会战胜蛮横和暴行。
    罪犯们和他们的帮凶们一定会被套上枷锁，受到严厉的惩罚。
    莫斯科“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂领班罗曼诺夫对美帝国主义者的暴行和罪恶表示无限的愤怒。这位老资格的工人对于朝鲜的保卫者表示友爱团结与深切的热爱之忱。他说：我们要求制止美帝国主义者在朝鲜的暴行，制止对朝鲜人民所进行的横暴掠夺的战争。我们坚决要求美国的秘密警察必须停止他们对朝鲜和中国战俘的虐待。
    苏联科学院数学研究所科学家西拉日丁诺夫在发言中指出：美国军人所施于巨济岛和釜山战俘营的朝中战俘的非人暴行与野蛮恐怖，已激起苏联各族人民的深切愤怒。他说：对于全世界千百万男女来说，巨济岛和釜山已不仅仅是朝鲜海峡地区的地理上的名字。它们在今天已经与麦丹尼克、布痕瓦尔德与奥斯威辛这些罪恶的名字连结在一起了。
    接着由“红色壮士”工厂女工福金娜讲话。
    她说：当我们想到美帝国主义者对保卫祖国自由与独立的爱好和平的朝鲜人民使用大规模屠杀的罪恶武器时，我们的心中就涌起了愤怒。美国军人的可恶的罪行的确是漫无止境的。对于我们这般还清楚地记着抵抗法西斯侵略者的艰苦的战争岁月的苏联男女，朝鲜人民的痛苦与忧患是非常亲切的，并且是可以理解的。
    苏联著名诗人苏尔科夫发言
    斥责艾奇逊无耻抵赖其罪行
    著名的苏联诗人苏尔科夫发表了动人的演说。他说：今天，心中的怒火使我们大家到这里来开会。
    自从美帝国主义者在联合国旗帜的掩护下，开始进攻爱好和平的朝鲜人民、在朝鲜土地上从事他们的血腥勾当以来，快要两年了。
    美国侵略者在这段时期中，已在多苦多难的朝鲜土地上干出了许许多多的恶行。
    他们已把成百座的城市和古代文化的光荣纪念物变成废墟。他们把繁茂的花园从大地上一扫而尽，用凝固汽油弹烧毁庄稼，毁灭了成千成万的和平村庄。
    美国干涉者由于军事上的失利而迁怒于和平居民，使千千万万儿童、妇女和老人丧命或者残废。
    这些吹嘘根本不存在的种族优越性、吹嘘臭名远扬的美国生活方式优越性的刽子手，他们所干出的罪行，比他们的前辈希特勒杀人犯的最可怕的罪行都更凶暴残忍。
    在住着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军士兵的美国战俘营里发生了空前的暴行，这种消息已传遍了全世界。
    现在人人都知道美国侵略者使用怎样的酷刑虐待，妄想使赤手空拳的人抛弃他们的祖国而变为叛国者。
    前任巨济岛美国战俘营长官柯尔生和杜德，就曾公开地证实了美国干涉者在巨济岛上所干的丑行和罪行。他们是被降级了，然而他们受到惩罚并不是因为他们干出了血腥罪行，而是因为他们承认了这些事实，他们打开了布幕，暴露了对朝中战俘正在干出的滔天暴行。
    美帝国主义者无意停止虐待和迫害朝中战俘。这可以从新任巨济岛战俘营长官美国准将波纳的声明中清楚地看出来。波纳说，他打算在今后还对战俘采取严厉手段。他说，他打算使战俘认识美国是强有力的，希望他能恢复控制而一点也不引起流血，那未免太乐观了。南朝鲜战俘营中成万的手无寸铁的人有被杀害的危险。只有全世界爱好和平的人提出声势浩大的抗议，才能制止美国侵略者的新罪行和挽救成千的人的生命。
    我要大声疾呼，抗议对巨济岛上的朝中战俘采取血腥的报复手段和对朝鲜平民使用细菌武器的美国干涉者的滔天罪行，我不能不提一提美国国务卿艾奇逊最近发表的声明。
    艾奇逊企图诬蔑人民对美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器和血腥屠杀朝中战俘的罪行提出愤怒抗议，说这种抗议是一种“诬蔑”美国和“鼓动仇视”美国的运动。
    全世界人民都知道：正是美国统治集团通过他们的发言人艾奇逊拒绝了关于禁止细菌武器以及其他大规模屠杀人民的武器的一切建议。他们知道：正是美国拒绝支持宣布细菌武器为非法的日内瓦议定书。
    美国政府的正式发言人——包括国务卿艾奇逊在内——曾一再抵赖说美国军队没有使用细菌武器。但是他们谁也没有斥责使用细菌武器的行为，谁也没有支持人民的要求，斥责进行细菌战是卑鄙而又违反人道的行为。
    大家知道，建议缔结五大国和平公约的不是美国，而是苏联，而且这个建议也为美国所拒绝了。
    各国人民知道：不是美国而是苏联正在坚持不渝地进行斗争，以便维护并巩固世界和平，建立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国，缔结对德和约与结束德国的占领状态；而美国却在割裂德国，并且在欧洲心脏地区建立一个对各爱好和平的国家进行军事侵略的跳板。
    因此不能抵赖文件和目击者的证词所证实的美国干涉者在朝鲜所干出的血腥罪行，艾奇逊就企图诬蔑抗议这些罪行的爱好和平的人民是敌视美国人民。艾奇逊的诬称爱好和平的人民“诬蔑”美国的许多声明的真正目的，就是要掩饰那美帝国主义者正在准备的发动新的世界战争的罪恶阴谋。
    任何人都知道：爱好和平的国家从来没有把主使侵略、组织朝鲜境内难以言状的暴行的美帝国主义者，和不久以前曾经和欧亚两洲人民并肩对法西斯瘟疫作战的爱好和平的美国人民混为一谈。
    苏联人民和世界上一切正直的男女一样，将以愈益增大的决心进行斗争，以保卫和平。他们热烈支持光荣的朝鲜保卫者的正义事业，并愤怒抗议美国侵略者和他们的侵略帮凶的血腥罪行。他们要求立即结束朝鲜战争并严惩战犯。
    大会通过决议
    号召制止美国侵略者的罪行
    莫斯科全市劳动人民大会通过的决议如下：
    我们，莫斯科劳动人民的代表——工人、职员、科学家、艺术家和文化工作者——举行了全市性的集会，和全世界千千万万男女一道，同声声讨美国侵略者在朝鲜战俘营一直在进行的空前血腥暴行。
    这些罪行，是美帝国主义者继他们最近在朝鲜和中国北部使用细菌武器之后的另一罪恶滔天的暴行。美国统治集团一直到现在始终没有谴责使用这种大规模屠杀的野蛮手段，这就证明了他们希望将来仍然使用这种卑鄙的不人道的武器。
    现在，美帝国主义者又再次蹂躏人类道德的原则，蹂躏一切国际法的标准。美国干涉者违反关于战俘的海牙公约和日内瓦公约，把巨济岛和朝鲜其他地方的战俘营变成了死亡营，和希特勒在奥斯威辛、布痕瓦尔德和麦丹尼克的死亡营已经没有什么分别。
    他们在这些战俘营里对朝中战俘实行了虐待、侮辱、野蛮毒打和集体枪杀的血腥统治。
    在朝鲜停战谈判中，美国侵略者提出了所谓战俘“自愿”遣返的条件，这是极端违反国际法和人道原则的。
    美国侵略者提出这样的条件，用意在于破坏朝鲜停战谈判，继续并扩大远东的侵略战争，加强新世界大战的威胁。为了这个目的，他们使用最残酷的暴行，强迫成千上万战俘参加中朝两国人民的死敌蒋介石和李承晚匪帮，替他们当炮灰。
    美国干涉者已被当场拿获，无可否认的证据和文件已经证明了他们的罪行，把他们在全世界人民之前暴露出来了。然而，美帝国主义者却公然准备对巨济岛的战俘实行新的野蛮镇压。全世界人民的良知和荣誉不能容忍美国干涉者这种滔天罪行。
    各国正直的男女、全体进步人类都声讨美国干涉者最近这种丑恶行为，并要求使美国军方停止对朝中战俘的屠杀。
    莫斯科劳动人民和苏联全体人民一样，对美帝国主义者在朝鲜这种不人道的罪行，表示无比的愤慨和激烈的抗议。
    我们和全世界进步力量一道，要求制止美国侵略者在朝鲜的这种暴行。我们要求给朝中战俘以人道的待遇，并毫不偏颇地遵守关于战俘的海牙公约和日内瓦公约。
    莫斯科劳动人民也像苏联全体男女一样，对于正在和美国的侵略进行英勇斗争的英雄的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，表示热烈的兄弟的声援。
    劳动人民有神圣的责任更加提高他们的警觉，不断地揭露帝国主义新战争挑拨者的阴谋，加强争取世界和平的斗争。
    莫斯科劳动人民将和全体苏联人民一道，继续为和平而坚持不渝地斗争，坚决地以忘我的爱国劳动来加强自己社会主义国家的威力。
    我们苏维埃祖国——世界和平的堡垒万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖和导师、亲爱的斯大林同志万岁！
