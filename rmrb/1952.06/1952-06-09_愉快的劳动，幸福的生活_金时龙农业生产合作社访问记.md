    Happy Labor, Happy Life
    ——A Visit to the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yu Changqin
    On a clear day in May, I visited Yingcheng Village in Yanji County, Jilin Province. This is a village with beautiful mountains and clear waters: to the north of the village are green mountains, and to the south is a winding river with flat, fertile paddy fields on both banks. Neat and clean farmhouses stand in the village. The famous Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative of New China is located here.
    I happened to arrive on their spring plowing competition's "attack day." All the able-bodied men of the cooperative were in a small paddy field south of the village, some controlling oxen-drawn plows, diligently turning the soil, others constantly wielding four-pronged harrows to loosen the soil. They were rushing to plow the last piece of paddy field, the most intense part of the spring plowing competition. Everyone's face was covered in rain-like sweat, but they were all very happy.
    It turned out that since the day the members of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative issued a challenge to farmers across the country to launch a patriotic production increase competition, they had engaged in a heated competition. The cooperative's proposed production increase plans and competition goals have become the action guidelines for every member. Long before the start of spring plowing, all members had launched a heated competition in various spring plowing preparation tasks such as repairing farm tools, selecting seeds, accumulating manure, preparing seedbeds, and plowing the land. When the swallows flew north, and the fields turned green, the cooperative's various spring plowing preparations were already in place. The scene of the sowing competition was even more intense; even the elderly, who usually rested, couldn't help but go up the mountain before sunrise every day and return only at dusk.
    Loving new farm tools and enjoying experimenting with new farming techniques are common characteristics of the members of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative, and the reason why they obtain high yields. They led me to visit their various small-scale "experimental fields": hotbed rice seedling pools, hotbed tobacco seedling pools, dry rice seedling pools, and cold bed rice seedling pools. The "cold bed seedling" method is an old method they have used for many years and are continuing to research and improve. "Hotbed seedling" was only tried last year and has already achieved good results. "Dry seedling" was just learned this year from the state-run agricultural experiment station. Seedling and transplanting are fundamental ways to improve paddy field farming methods. For example, the "hotbed seedling" method can produce rice seedlings half a month earlier than the "cold bed seedling" method, so transplanting is earlier, maturation is earlier, and the harvest is also higher. I saw that the rice seeds sprinkled in the "cold bed pool" had just sprouted, while the rice seedlings cultivated in the "hotbed" were already more than three inches tall. This year, they have achieved another success in experimenting with new farming techniques, which is the successful trial use of new-style horse-drawn farm tools. Although they didn't have horses, they used oxen instead. When they measured the furrows plowed by the new-style plow on the newly plowed land and proved that the new-style plow could plow twice as deep as the old-style plow, everyone raised their thumbs and praised the new farm tool as a good farm tool that had never existed since ancient times. They happily said, "Now we have even better ways to increase production!"
    What excited me the most was the high degree of diligence of the cooperative's women. Almost every labor occasion had women participating. Cui Tailie, the deputy director of the cooperative, told me that women are also the main force in their production. Of the ninety laborers in the cooperative, fifty-eight are women. In the recent democratic election of three sowing models, two of them were women. Women have used their production achievements to change men's consistent underestimation of women. All kinds of labor in the production of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative are reasonably shared by male and female members, with female members undertaking various tasks that their physical strength can handle. For example, during sowing, men hold the plow, and women plant seeds or spread fertilizer. In the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative, men and women are equally loving laborers.
    I also paid attention to their lives. When I arrived at the village, a middle-aged man named Cui Zhongtian, in his forties, wearing new clothes and with parted hair, warmly came to greet me. At the time, I guessed he must be the village teacher. However, I soon found him in the crowd of hard workers. At this time, he was covered in mud, and from his operation, I knew that he was originally a skilled plowman. The facts told me that everyone here generally has two kinds of clothes, one is ordinary "work clothes," and the other is good clothes worn during rest. Women are the same way, and whenever they rest, they change into their brightly colored clothes. Here, rice has become the daily grain for farmers, and many members eat rice all year round. The lives of the children are very happy. All children of school age are enrolled, and older children have gone to middle school in the city. Toddlers who cannot go to school are concentrated in nurseries, where they are raised by nannies. The location of the nursery is the most beautiful building in the village – a new-style Western-style house that can accommodate forty or fifty children. The children live happily and collectively in the nursery, and the mothers work in the fields all day with peace of mind.
    Here, the atmosphere of learning culture and current affairs is also very strong. Blackboards are constantly publishing various major domestic and foreign news. People have not forgotten to study even in the most intense sowing competition. Whenever they rest, the newspaper reader reads the newspaper aloud in the crowd. Young male and female members insist on going to night school to study after working all day.
    Everyone knows that this happy life is the result of labor, especially the result of organized collective labor. Cooperative director Jin Shilong said, "We organized ourselves according to Chairman Mao's instructions and only then did we get this good life!" They have set a good example for farmers to move towards a prosperous life.

    愉快的劳动，幸福的生活
    ——金时龙农业生产合作社访问记
    新华社记者　于长钦
    五月里的一个晴朗的日子，我访问了吉林省延吉县的英成村。这是一个山水清秀的村庄：村北是青绿的山岭，村南有一条弯曲的小河，两岸是平坦肥沃的稻田，村中立着一幢幢整齐清洁的农舍。新中国著名的金时龙农业生产合作社就在这里。
    我正巧赶上了他们春耕竞赛的“突击日”。全社青壮年男子，大伙儿都在村子正南一片不大的稻田里，有的掌握着牛拉犁杖紧张地翻着泥土，有的不停地挥动着四齿扒子将泥土刨松。这是他们在突击抢翻最后一块稻田，也是春耕中最紧张的竞赛。每个人的脸上都流着雨点般的汗珠，但个个都很愉快。
    原来，金时龙农业生产合作社的社员们，自从向全国各地农民兄弟发出开展爱国增产竞赛运动的挑战的那天起，就展开了热烈的竞赛。全社所提增产计划和竞赛目标，已成为每个社员的行动指针。早在春耕开始之前，全体社员就在修理农具、选种、积粪、打槎子、翻地等各种春耕准备工作中展开了热烈的竞赛。当燕子北飞，山野变青，播种时节到来时，全社各项春耕准备工作，早已准备妥当了。播种竞赛的情景，更是热烈，连往常已经告休了的老人，也不自禁地，每天天不见太阳就上山去，到天黑才回来。
    热爱新农具，喜欢试验新的农作技术，是金时龙农业生产合作社社员们的共同特点，也是他们获得高额产量的由来。他们引我参观了他们的各个小规模的“试验场”：温床育稻苗池、温床育菸苗池、旱育稻苗池、冷床育稻苗池等。“冷床育苗”法，是他们已经采用多年的老方法，现正继续研究改进中。“温床育苗”从去年才试用，已获得良好效果。“旱育苗”是今年刚从国营农业试验场学习来的。育苗插秧，是改进稻田耕作方法的根本办法。如“温床育苗”法可比“冷床育苗”法早半月育成稻苗，因此插秧早，成熟早，收成也高。我看到撒在“冷床池”里的稻种刚刚发芽，而“温床”培育的稻苗已三寸多高了。今年，他们在试验新的农作技术上又获得了另一成就，就是试用新式马拉农具的成功。虽然没有马匹，但他们使用牛代替马拉。当他们在新翻过的土地上衡量了新式犁趟成的垅沟，证明新式犁确比旧式犁能够深耕一倍时，人人都扬起拇指夸奖新农具是从古以来没有过的好农具。他们高兴地说：“今后增产更有办法了！”
    最使我兴奋的是该社妇女们的高度的勤劳精神。差不多每个劳动场合都有妇女们参加。该社副主任崔泰烈告诉我：妇女同样是他们生产中的主力军。在全社九十个劳动力中，有五十八个妇女。在最近由大家民主评选出的三名播种模范中，就有两名是妇女。妇女们用自己的生产成绩，改变了男人们一贯轻视妇女的看法。金时龙农业生产合作社生产中的各种劳动都合理地由男社员和女社员分担着，女社员担当着体力所能胜任的各种工作。如播种时，男人扶犁，妇女点种或攎粪。在金时龙农业生产合作社，男子和妇女同是平等友爱的劳动者。
    我又留心观察了他们的生活。当我到达该村时，一位年在四十上下，身着新装，留着分发，名叫崔仲天的中年男子热情地前来接待我。当时，我猜想他该是村里的教员。可是，不久我就在紧张劳动的人群里发现了他。这时他是浑身泥土，从他的操作中我知道了他原是一个技术熟练的犁手。事实告诉我，这里所有的人，一般都有两种服装，一种是普通的“劳动服”，另一种是在休息时穿的好衣服。妇女们也是这样，每当休息的时候，便换上她们的颜色鲜艳的服装。在这里，大米已成为农家的日常粮食，不少社员整年吃大米。儿童们的生活是很幸福的。所有到了上学年龄的儿童，都入学了，大一点的已进城上了中学。不能上学的幼儿，都集中在托儿所里，由保姆教养着。托儿所的所址，是村里最漂亮的建筑物——一所可以容纳四、五十个儿童的新式洋房。孩子们在托儿所愉快地集体地生活着，母亲们安安心心地整日在田野劳动。
    在这里，学习文化，学习时事的风气也很盛。黑板报，不时发表着国内外各种重大消息。人们在最紧张的播种竞赛中，也没有忘掉学习，每当休息下来，读报员就在人群中高声读着报纸。年青的男女社员们，在整日劳动之后，坚持上夜校去学习。
    谁都知道，这种幸福的生活，正是劳动的成果，尤其是组织起来共同劳动的成果。合作社主任金时龙这样说：“我们是按照毛主席的指示组织起来，才得到这个好日子的！”他们树立了农民走向富裕生活的好榜样。
