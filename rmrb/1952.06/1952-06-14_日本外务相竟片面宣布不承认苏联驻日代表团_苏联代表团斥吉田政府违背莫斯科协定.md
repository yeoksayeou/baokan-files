    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 12th: The TASS news agency reports that Mr. Tamura, a representative of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, visited the Soviet Delegation in Tokyo on May 30th of this year, acting on instructions from the Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki, to deliver an oral statement regarding the Soviet Delegation to Japan. The statement said: Because the Treaty of Peace with Japan took effect on April 28th, 1952, and because the Allied Council for Japan has concluded its work, "the Japanese government considers that the Soviet Delegation to the Allied Council for Japan no longer exists from this day forward."
    In response to this statement from the Japanese government, the Soviet Delegation to Japan delivered a letter to Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki on June 11th. The contents of this letter are as follows:
    As everyone knows, the Soviet Delegation to Japan was established according to the decision passed by the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain, and subsequently joined by China. The Allied Council for Japan was unilaterally dissolved by the American government after the conclusion of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, violating the existing four-power agreement and without the consent of the Soviet government and the Chinese People's Government.
    Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the aforementioned effect of the separate treaty mentioned by the Japanese government cannot serve as a legitimate basis for the aforementioned statement regarding the Soviet Delegation to Japan.

    日本外务相竟片面宣布不承认苏联驻日代表团
    苏联代表团斥吉田政府违背莫斯科协定
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：日本外务省代表田村先生于本年五月三十日往访苏联驻东京代表团，奉日本外务相冈崎胜男的指示，发表关于苏联驻日代表团的口头声明。这个声明说：由于对日和约已于一九五二年四月二十八日生效，由于盟国对日委员会已经结束工作，“日本政府认为：盟国对日委员会的苏联代表团自即日起不再存在”。
    苏联驻日代表团为了答复日本政府的这一项声明，于六月十一日以信件一封送达日本外务相冈崎胜男先生，这封信件的内容如下：
    大家知道，苏联驻日代表团是根据苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议所通过，随后又有中国参加的决定而成立的。盟国对日委员会是由美国政府在缔结了非法的单独对日和约以后，片面地违背着现有的四国协定，未经过苏联政府和中国人民政府的同意而解散的。
    因此，苏联政府认为：日本政府所提到的单独和约生效一节，不能成为前述关于苏联驻日代表团之声明的合法根据。
