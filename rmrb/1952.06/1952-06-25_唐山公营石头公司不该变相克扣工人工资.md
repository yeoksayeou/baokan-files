    To the Editorial Board: The leading cadres of the Tangshan Public Stone Company have a serious bureaucratic work style. They are indifferent to the welfare of the workers and ignore the opinions of the workers, which affects the production enthusiasm of the workers. Now we are telling you the situation, and we hope that the relevant authorities will deal with it quickly.
    The Stone Company has more than 3,000 workers, most of whom go up the mountain to quarry stones. It is a heavy and dangerous job to quarry stones manually, so many workers are injured. However, the administration is extremely unconcerned about the injured workers. In the past, there was no clinic in the company for a long time. After repeated requests from the workers, a clinic was set up in February this year. The clinic is poorly equipped, with only one small room and two doctors. Injured workers and patients have to wait for treatment on the street, which not only obstructs traffic but also affects the health of patients. These two doctors lack the idea of serving the workers, have a bad attitude towards the workers, and are irresponsible in their work. Some injured workers need to rest after diagnosis. However, except for a small number of seriously injured workers who cannot move, most of the injured workers still have to burn tea boilers with their injuries. Burning tea boilers is a very tiring job, requiring carrying more than 80 loads of water every day. The injuries of many injured workers have become more serious. If the injured worker is unwilling to burn the tea boiler, the doctor will not allow him to take sick leave.
    In December 1951, the administrative负责人 of the company said to the workers at a meeting: "Now the company's economic situation is not good, the tools for quarrying stones will be bought by the workers temporarily; when the company's economic situation improves, the company will buy them again." Since then, the company has deducted tool costs from the workers' wages every month (an average of about 15,000 yuan per person). In 1951, the company obtained a net profit of 2.5 billion yuan, but still deducted tool costs from the workers' wages. The workers all said: "In any public factory or mine, the workers use public tools. We don't know which regulation the Stone Company is based on to do this?"
    The people in the Stone Company who collect the amount of stones often collect more stones but give less money. Converted into kind, each cart of stones is short of seven kilograms of corn.
    Last November, the Stone Company classified more than 200 old workers over the age of 45 with many years of work experience and good health as outside workers; this is very unreasonable. Outside workers can only enjoy half of the labor insurance benefits (while inside workers can enjoy all labor insurance benefits), and earn less wages. Gao Peng, an old worker who has worked on the stone mountain for more than 30 years, was classified as an outside worker, and he shed tears of sadness. Many workers said: "What article of the Trade Union Law are they basing this on?"
    The production situation of the Stone Company is chaotic. The administration does not pay attention to the reasonable opinions raised by the workers. For example, the company's production of rough dross (which can be smashed for railway and road ballast) has accumulated more than 10,000 meters (worth more than 100 million yuan) and cannot be sold. The workers have repeatedly put forward disposal opinions, but the administration always says there is no way. Recently, a comrade from the company's production section also said to the workers: "We don't plan to keep these rough dross anymore. After a while, let's carry them outside the site and throw them away!" We believe that the Stone Company should quickly solve these problems.

    Editor's note: The problems exposed by workers Feng Jiuling and Feng Jiulu are very serious. The leading cadres of the Tangshan Public Stone Company should immediately examine this exploitative class thinking of not caring about the workers' hardships and disguisedly deducting workers' wages, earnestly change this extremely bad work style, and publish the results of the examination in the newspaper.

### 唐山公营石头公司不该变相克扣工人工资

    唐山公营石头公司不该变相克扣工人工资
    编辑同志：唐山市公营石头公司领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。他们对工人福利漠不关心，对工人意见置之不理，影响了工人群众的生产积极性。现在我们把情况告诉你们，希望有关机关迅速处理。
    石头公司共有三千多工人，大部分工人上山采石头。用人力采石头是一件繁重而危险的工作，因此工人受伤的很多。但行政方面对受伤工人极不关心。过去公司里长时期没有诊疗所，经过工人们多次要求，今年二月才设立了一个诊疗所。诊疗所设备很坏，只有一间小屋，两个医生。受伤的工人和病人都得坐在大街上候诊，既妨碍交通，又影响病人健康。这两个医生缺乏为工人服务的思想，对工人态度很坏，在工作上不负责任。有些受伤的工人，经过诊断，需要休养。但是，除了一部分伤势严重不能行动者外，大部分伤员还得带伤烧茶锅。烧茶锅是一件很累的工作，每天要挑八十多担水。许多伤员的伤势更加严重了。如果伤员不愿烧茶锅，医生就不准他请病假。
    一九五一年十二月，公司行政负责人在大会上对工人说：“现在公司经济情况不好，开采石头的工具暂时由工人买；到公司经济情况好转时，再由公司买。”此后，公司每月从工人工资里扣除工具费
    （每人平均一万五千元左右）。一九五一年，公司获得纯利二十五亿元，但仍从工人工资里扣除工具费。工人们都说：“无论那个公营的工厂、矿山，工人都是用公家的工具，咱石头公司这样做，不知是根据那一条？”
    石头公司收量石头的人，常常是多收石头少给钱。折合成实物，每车石头要少发七斤玉米。
    去年十一月，石头公司把二百多个四十五岁以上的有多年工作经验而且身体健康的老工人，划为外工；这是很不合理的。外工只可享受劳保待遇的一半（里工则可享受全部劳保待遇），挣的工钱也少了。高鹏是个在石头山上做工三十多年的老工人，竟被划为外工，他伤心得流了泪。好多工人说：“他们这样办是根据工会法那一条呀？”
    石头公司的生产情况是混乱的。工人提出合理的意见，行政方面却不加理睬。例如，公司出产的毛碴（可砸作铁道及马路用碴），已经积压了一万余米（价值一亿元以上）无法销售。工人多次提出处理意见，行政方面总说没有办法。最近公司生产科一个同志还向工人说：“这些毛碴不打算要了，过些时候抬到场外扔了吧！”我们认为，石头公司应该赶快解决这些问题。
    唐山市启新洋灰厂工人冯九龄、冯九禄
    编者按：工人冯九龄、冯九禄揭发的这些问题是很严重的。唐山公营石头公司的领导干部应该立即检查这种不关心工人疾苦、变相克扣工人工资的剥削阶级思想，认真地改变这种十分恶劣的作风，并把检查结果在报上发表。
