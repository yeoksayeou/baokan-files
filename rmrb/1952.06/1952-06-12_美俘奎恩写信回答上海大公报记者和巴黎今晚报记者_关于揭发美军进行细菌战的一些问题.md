Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: American Air Force prisoner of war John Quinn wrote a letter answering questions from Zhu Qiping, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao in Shanghai, and Bequet, a reporter from Paris Tonight, regarding his exposure of the US military's germ warfare. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Mr. Zhu and Mr. Bequet:

This letter is to answer the questions you raised to me.

1. "Before and after you narrated all that you knew about germ warfare and your own participation in it, what was the attitude of the prisoner of war camp authorities towards you?"

I have read reports about Nazi prisoner camps, reports about the inhumane and abusive acts within their walls or barbed wire. I have read and heard tragic stories of soldiers captured by the Japanese. I have seen various photos graphically illustrating what it was like to be a prisoner of war during World War II. I have heard and read stories about the cruelty of the "Orient." (There is no need to talk about these tortures.) Life was a cheap commodity. Before being shot down, the only hope for fair treatment once captured came from words like "they 'might' not kill you" and "you 'won't' be tortured." However, I rarely thought about these things until I was actually captured. After I was captured, all of this rushed into my mind, and my anticipated future was not very promising.

As a prisoner of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, my life was good. All my worries were gradually dispelled, or at least faded away. But the real test came when I decided I should admit that I had dropped germ bombs near two major cities in North Korea—Pyongyang and Kunu-ri. If everything I had done in my nineteen missions (bombing and strafing trucks and trains) could be forgiven as an American soldier fulfilling his duty, then dropping germ bombs was still a crime of its own kind. The excellent treatment I saw generally given to prisoners of war did not completely convince me, and I anxiously awaited the consequences of my confession.

2. "After you confessed to participating in germ warfare, what measures did they take against you?"

I was soon transferred to another prisoner of war camp. There I met the highest-ranking officer of the prisoner of war camp. He told me that I should recognize the seriousness of my crimes, but I should not worry about it all day long. He said that I should do my best to assist in exposing those who were responsible for initiating germ warfare, and that I should cooperate in all aspects with the people he would send to me from time to time. He told me that I could tell his representatives my needs and desires at any time. His conversation with me was a great pleasure to me and relieved many of my worries.

A few days later, Korean and Chinese journalists came to visit me. None of them had any hatred towards me. Their only purpose was to thoroughly clarify the issue of germ warfare and expose the truth to the people of the world.

After the interviews with the journalists, the more important parts of the conversation were recorded. Then we filmed the conversation. These measures were taken to emphasize to the world that germ warfare had indeed been used. These measures will greatly help mobilize public opinion, making it a powerful force to condemn this crime.

3. "What are your opinions on the measures to expose germ warfare?"

Fate has placed me in a position where I must distinguish between the following responsibilities: the responsibility as a soldier to the military authorities and the responsibility as an American citizen to the people. I have no doubt in my mind now, nor have I ever had any doubt before, nor could I have any doubt: the American people are resolutely opposed to anyone or any group advocating germ warfare, and they will wholeheartedly support all measures against germ warfare.

I certainly agree with the current practices and hope they are successful soon. Public opinion is the only thing that can stop germ warfare. If properly organized, public opinion can demand the necessary international action to permanently stop germ warfare. Until such action is taken, germ warfare will always be a threat to humanity. We should cooperate on this matter regardless of nationality.

Shortly after filming, I moved to a house across the river. This place is particularly beautiful. We have talked many times about how suitable it is as a rest area. Everywhere you look here is beautiful. Speaking of mountains, there are smooth and undulating, rugged and majestic, but all the mountains are covered with green trees and leaves, interspersed with newly cultivated land. The meadows everywhere attract people to lie down and bathe in the beautiful sunshine. And the river, like a large lake, has serene green water, complementing the beautiful village scenery around it. On warm afternoons, it has an irresistible attraction.

The atmosphere of this place makes people feel more deeply how people need to unite to eradicate the evil of germ warfare, and then forever eliminate the threat of war. In such an environment, one cannot help but think that the spirit of friendship will eventually break down national boundaries. Not the kind of friendship "from this sea to that sea," but the friendship between people. We must now unite on some things, and opposing germ warfare is one of them. On this point, national borders do not exist. The enemy here is the enemy of mankind. Mankind must unite to eliminate this enemy forever, or it will be eliminated itself.

4. "What are your thoughts on your personal role in helping to expose germ warfare?"

Sometimes I think again of the worries I had before. Sometimes I feel ashamed that I did not know more about the countries where the movements for world peace are the most organized and the largest. Sometimes, when I think of how the peace movement in our country lacks publicity, how it is portrayed as a bad thing, and how the peace movement is slandered as communist propaganda, my heart aches. Fear of the consequences of confession should not have influenced my attitude. My only consideration should be: whether those who listen to my confession really want to use these materials now to stop germ warfare, and also to prevent the same thing from happening in the future. If I had known about the Chinese policy of peace long ago and still did not reveal the germ warfare materials on the grounds that we Americans were at war, then I would be guilty. Although germ warfare has not yet been used against American troops, American troops will not be safer than other people in the world if this crime is not exposed and crushed forever.

My contribution to this matter is my obligation to the American people, and also to the people of other countries in the world. Everyone, no matter what contribution they can make, owes this to themselves, to their children, to their country, and to the whole world. This will be a big step forward for mankind in the pursuit of lasting peace. World public opinion is in favor of doing so, and world public opinion will surely prevail.

    美俘奎恩写信回答上海大公报记者和巴黎今晚报记者
    关于揭发美军进行细菌战的一些问题
    【新华社十一日讯】美国空军战俘约翰·奎恩写信答复大公报记者朱启平和巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌关于他揭发美军进行细菌战的一些问题。信的全文如下：亲爱的朱先生和贝却敌先生：
    这封信是来回答你们向我提出的问题的。
    一、“在你叙述了对细菌战所知的种种以及你自己参加细菌战这事以前和以后，战俘营当局对你的态度如何？”
    我曾经读到过关于纳粹俘虏营的报告，关于在它们围墙或铁丝网内的无人道及淫虐行为的报告。我曾经读过和听过被日本人俘虏的士兵们的悲惨遭遇故事。我曾经看过各种照片，形象地说明了在第二次世界大战时期做一个战俘是怎么一回事。我曾听到并读到过有关“东方”残忍性的故事。（这些酷刑不必去谈了。）生命，是一种廉价的商品。在被打下以前，对一旦做俘虏可获得公平待遇的唯一希望，是从“他们‘可能’不会杀你”，“你‘不致’会受刑”之类的话来的。不过，在我真的做了俘虏以前，我是很少去想这种事情的。当我做了俘虏以后，这一切都涌上了我的心头，而我预想的未来是不很圆满的。
    作为一个中国志愿军的俘虏，我的生活是好的。我的一切顾虑逐一地消除，或者至少是隐没了。但是，真正考验的关头，是在我决定我应该承认我曾在北朝鲜的两个大城市——平壤和军隅里附近投过细菌炸弹。如果在我的十九次出任务中所做的一切（轰炸和扫射卡车和火车）能被当作一个美国士兵履行职务而被宽赦的话，那末投细菌弹仍然是一种自成一类的罪行。我见到的一般战俘所受到的极好的待遇，并不能使我完全相信，我焦急地等待着我供认的结果。
    二、“在你供认参与细菌战以后，他们对你采取了什么措施？”
    我不久被转移到另一个战俘营去。在那里我见到了战俘营最高的长官。他告诉我应该认识到我的罪行的严重性，但亦不必整天不忘地为此忧虑。他说我应该尽力协助揭发那些应负发动细菌战责任的人，同时我应该对他不时派来我处的人在各方面予以合作。他对我说，我可以在任何时间把我的需要与愿望告诉他的代表。他对我的谈话，对我是一种极大的愉快，而且解除了我心中的许多忧虑。
    数天以后，朝鲜和中国的记者们来访问我。他们中没有一个人对我有过一点憎恨，他们唯一的目的，是要彻底弄清细菌战的问题，并向全世界人民暴露事实的真相。
    和记者们会谈后，谈话中较重要的部分作了录音。接着我们又拍了谈话的影片。这些措施都是为了向全世界强调细菌战的确已被采用了。这些措施，将大大有助于动员舆论，使其成为责难这种罪行的巨大力量。
    三、“你对暴露细菌战的措施有什么意见？”
    命运使我处在这样一个地位，使我必须在下列责任中作一区别：即作为一个士兵对军事当局的责任和作为一个美国公民对人民的责任。我心中现在没有怀疑，以前也从未有过怀疑，同时也不可能有怀疑：美国人民是坚决反对主张细菌战的任何人或任何集团的，而且他们将全心支持一切反对细菌战的措施。
    我当然同意现在的做法，而且希望他们很快地获得成功。舆论是制止细菌战的唯一东西。舆论若恰当地组织起来，则能要求采取必要的国际行动，来永远制止细菌战。在采取这样的行动以前，细菌战始终将成为人类的一种威胁。我们应该不分国别地在这件事上进行合作。
    拍完影片不久，我就移到河的对岸一所房子里了。这个地方特别美丽，我们多次谈到这里是多么适宜作一个休养地。这儿举目环视，无一不美。讲到山，则有平滑有起伏，有崎岖有严峻，但所有的山上都布满了青丛翠叶，其间还有新种的耕地。到处的草地都吸引着人躺下去，沐浴在美丽的阳光中。而河呢，像大湖一样，有悠悠青水，配衬着四周美丽的村景，相得益彰。在暖和的下午，它更有一种不可抗拒的引诱力。
    这个地方的气氛，使人更深切地感到人们是如何需要团结一致来根除细菌战争的罪恶，进而永远消灭战争的威胁。在这样一个环境下，一个人不能不想到友爱的精神最后一定会打破国家的界限。不是那种“这一海到那一海”的友爱，而是人与人的友爱。我们现在必须在一些事情上团结起来，反对细菌战就是其中之一。在这一点上，国界是不存在的。这儿的敌人，就是人类的敌人。人类必须团结起来，永远消灭这个敌人，否则自己将被消灭。
    四、“对你个人在协助揭露细菌战中所起的作
    用，你有什么感想？”
    有时候，我又想到以前产生过的忧虑。有时候我感到惭愧，惭愧我没有更多地了解那些国内争取世界和平的运动是最有组织而且规模最大的国家。有时候，当我想起在我国和平运动是如何缺乏宣传，如何被说成是一件坏事，而且诬蔑和平运动为共产党的宣传，在这样的时候，我心中就难过。对供认的后果所怀的恐惧，不应该影响我的态度。我唯一的考虑应该是：听我供认的人是否真想用这些材料现在就去制止细菌战争，而且还要防止将来再发生同样事情。如果我早已知道中国人对和平的政策而仍然以我们美国人是在作战为理由，而不说出细菌战的材料，那我就是有罪了。虽然细菌战目前还未用来对付美国军队，但是如果这种罪行不被揭露并永远被粉碎，那么，美国军队是不会比世界上其他人民更安全些。
    我在这件事上的贡献，是我对美国人民，同样也是对世界其他国家人民的义务。每一个人，无论他能有什么贡献，这都是对他自己，对他子女，对他国家，以及对全世界的一种义务。这将是人类在追求持久和平道路上向前迈进的一个大步。全世界舆论赞成这样做，而全世界舆论一定会胜利的。
