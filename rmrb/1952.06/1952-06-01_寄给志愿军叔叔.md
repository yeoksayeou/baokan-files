    A Letter to the Volunteer Army Uncles
    Red Scarf Class of Baojia Street Elementary School, District 2, Beijing

    Dear Volunteer Army Uncles:
    All of us young pioneers in the Red Scarf Class of Baojia Street Elementary School in Beijing extend to you our warmest greetings and respect!

    Our "June 1st" Children's Day has arrived. On this day, we will wear the flower-patterned clothes made by our mothers, tie our bright red scarves, eat the candies bought by our fathers and mothers, jump, sing, and celebrate our own festival together with children all over the world. We will go boating in the park, watch movies, and visit places. We will also meet with writers, scientists, musicians, model workers, and combat heroes! Uncles, we are like flowers in spring, blooming everywhere, all over Beijing, all over China.

    On this happy holiday, we think of you. You are fighting the enemy day and night, protecting us so that we can live such happy lives. You must be thinking of us in the front, hoping that we will study hard and grow up to serve the motherland well. Then, you will be very happy to hear about our academic achievements and life situation in the past year. Now we will report to you in detail.

    In the past year, because of the enthusiastic guidance of the teachers and the Young Pioneer organization, and because you often write to encourage us, we have all worked hard in our studies. All forty-seven students in our class have been approved as glorious Young Pioneers and have been awarded the beautiful red scarves. Our class has therefore won the glorious title of "Red Scarf Class." We strive not to disappoint this honor. In the last semester, the grades of thirty-seven students in our class were rated as A, and ten students were rated as B. No one in the class failed or received a C. We know that studying is for the motherland. We must not only do well in our own studies, but also pay attention to helping other students. We especially cherish the collective honor of our class. If a team member falls behind, other students also feel sad. Under the guidance of the teacher, we have established many extracurricular study groups: such as the nature group, the literature and art group, the newspaper reading group, the broadcasting group, etc. In the nature group, we study scientific knowledge and use our hands to create a "knowledge corner" in the classroom, which contains various specimens we have collected and models we have made ourselves. Recently, in order to celebrate "June 1st" Children's Day, we also made small radio receivers, small transmitters, and slide projectors by hand. In the literature and art group, we read good literary works, we recite poems, and we often recite the Korean dispatches published in the People's Daily, watching your stories of fighting the enemy. We subscribe to our own China Children's News and read it once a week. Our radio listening group carefully listens to the children's programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station every day. Sometimes, we also hear your representatives speaking to us on the radio. Last time, we heard Uncle Chai Chuanruo, a returning representative, speak to us, and we were very happy and said that we would do what he told us.

    On Sundays, we often visit various exhibitions, such as the coal mine exhibition, the petroleum exhibition, the railway exhibition, the health exhibition, as well as exhibitions of many people's democratic countries such as Romania and Czechoslovakia. The content is really rich. Each exhibition has given us the most vivid lesson. We also make friends with Liberation Army uncles, model workers, writers, and musicians. They are so nice to us. Liberation Army uncles often have parties with us, participate in our team meetings, tell us battle stories, play the accordion and violin, and cultivate our brave and optimistic spirit. Model worker Uncle Yuan Shikun told us about his invention of carbon powder in telephone sets, and told us to study hard and overcome difficulties. Writer Zhang Tianyi likes us very much. When he was sick, we went to see him, and he told us stories, told us about his new works, and asked us for our opinions. And Marco, the composer of the song "We are Tomorrow's Youth League Members," which we like to sing the most, we also visited him. He told us how to respect and love the working people, how to learn folk music, and how to cultivate a hard and good working attitude. At first, we thought composing was a very easy thing! Volunteer Army uncles, our motherland is really a happy big family, so many people care for, love, cultivate, and educate us!

    Studying in such a happy environment, we are all thinking about how to serve the motherland in the future. Student Xu Shan wants to be an architect and build the motherland more beautiful; but he also likes music and mathematics, he wants to make his architecture scientific and artistic. Student Qiu Lixia is determined to be an electrical worker, and he wants to accelerate the electrification of the motherland. Student Li Yanwei is from the countryside, and he is determined to be an agronomist and make the motherland's land more fertile. Also, female student Wang Xiuyan wants to be a train driver, Yao Chaoxuan wants to be the most loving childcare worker, our team leader Zhang Xu wants to be a doctor, Wang Ruisheng wants to be a people's air force... There's no end to it, everyone has their own aspirations. Uncles, you won't laugh at us, will you? We know that these aspirations are not daydreams. As long as we work hard, we will definitely be able to do it.

    Our class is now the highest class in the school, and the younger students call us big brothers and sisters. We often help them too. For example, repairing their desks and chairs, wiping glass, and repairing their schoolbags. We also helped the second-grade students establish a library. After class, we tell stories to the students, teach them to sing and dance. The students in our school are as loving as if they were born from the same mother.

    From January 1st this year, our class has been writing "Red Scarf Class Diary" every day. After school for five minutes every day, the whole class discusses it and records important things. We often remind everyone to remember the collective honor of our "Red Scarf Class". For example, sometimes two team members have a quarrel, some team members don't listen to the teacher, or read bad old comic books, we will criticize them in the "Red Scarf Class Diary". In this way, our shortcomings can be corrected quickly.

    Dear uncles, although we have made these progress in this year, we will never be arrogant or complacent. We must continue to work hard. All our team members are determined to study hard, be ready at all times, and strive to build our great motherland and realize Chairman Mao's great ideals! Best wishes from your most beloved Young Pioneers!

    寄给志愿军叔叔
    北京市二区鲍家街小学红领巾班亲爱的志愿军叔叔们：
    我们北京鲍家街小学红领巾班全体少年儿童队员，向你们致以热烈的慰问和敬意！
    我们的“六一”儿童节来到了。这一天，我们要穿着妈妈做的花衣服，结着鲜红的领巾，吃着爸爸妈妈给买的糖果，跳着，唱着，和全世界的小朋友们一道庆祝我们自己的节日。我们要去公园里划小船，我们看电影，我们去参观。我们还要和文学家、科学家、音乐家、劳动模范、战斗英雄见面！叔叔们，我们就好像春天的花朵一样，到处开放着，开遍了整个北京城，开遍了全中国。
    在这样快乐的节日里，我们想起了你们。你们不分昼夜在和敌人作战，保卫着我们，我们才能过着这样幸福的生活。你们在前方，一定惦记着我们，希望我们好好学习，长大起来好好为祖国服务。那末，你们一定很高兴听听我们一年来的学习成绩和生活情形吧。下面我们要详细报告给你们。
    一年来，因为老师和少年儿童队组织的热心教导，因为你们常常来信鼓励我们，我们都努力学习。我们全班四十七个同学，都被批准为光荣的少年儿童队员，戴上了美丽的红领巾。我们的班因此获得了“红领巾班”的光荣称号。我们努力不辜负这个荣誉。在上学期，我们全班三十七个同学的成绩得到甲等，十个同学是乙等，全班没有成绩不及格的，也没有丙等的。我们知道学习是为了祖国。我们不但要把自己的功课学好，还注意帮助别的同学。我们特别爱护我们班的集体荣誉。如果有一个队员落后了，别的同学也感到难过。我们在老师的指导下，成立了好多课外学习小组：像自然组、文艺组、读报组、广播组等等。在自然组里，我们钻研科学知识，用我们的双手在教室里开辟了一个“知识角”，里面放着我们搜集来的各种标本和自己做的模型。最近为了庆祝“六一”节，我们还亲手做成了小收报机、小发报机和幻灯机。在文艺组里，我们阅读好的文艺作品，我们朗读诗歌，也常常朗诵人民日报上登载的朝鲜通讯，看你们和敌人作战的故事。我们订有自己的中国少年报，每周要读报一次。我们的收听广播小组，每天细心地收听中央人民广播电台的少年儿童节目。有时在收音机里，也听到你们的代表对我们的讲话。那次，我们听到归国代表柴川若叔叔对我们的讲话，我们高兴极啦，都说要照着他告诉我们的话去做。
    到了星期日，我们常常去参观各种展览会，像煤矿展览、石油展览、铁路展览、卫生展览，还有罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克等许多人民民主国家的展览，内容真是丰富极了。每一次展览都给我们上了最生动的课。我们又和解放军叔叔、劳动模范、作家、音乐家交朋友。他们对我们真好。解放军叔叔常常和我们一起联欢，参加我们的队会，给我们讲战斗故事，拉手风琴和小提琴，培养我们勇敢、乐观的精神。劳动模范袁世昆叔叔告诉我们他发明电话机内炭素粉的经过，告诉我们要刻苦学习，克服困难。作家张天翼伯伯可喜欢我们啦。他生病时，我们去看他，他还给我们讲故事，讲他的新作品，要我们提意见。还有我们最喜欢唱的歌“我们是明天的青年团员”的作曲家马可叔叔，我们也去访问他啦。他给我们讲怎样尊重和热爱劳动人民，怎样学习民间音乐，怎样培养坚苦的良好的劳动态度。我们起先还以为作曲是挺轻松的事哩！志愿军叔叔们，我们的祖国真是一个幸福的大家庭，那么多人关心、爱护、培养、教育着我们哪！
    在这样幸福的环境里学习着，我们都在想着将来怎样为祖国服务。徐山同学想要做一个建筑师，把祖国建设得更美丽；但他也喜欢音乐和数学，他要使他的建筑合乎科学，还要艺术化。仇力侠同学立志当一名电机工人，他想要加速祖国的电气化。李彦未同学是从乡下来的，他立志要当农学家，把祖国的土地变得更肥沃。还有，女同学王秀艳要当火车司机，药朝萱要做一个最慈爱的保育工作者，我们的中队长张煦要当医生，王瑞生要当人民空军……说不完啦，我们每个人都有自己的志愿。叔叔们，你们不会笑我们吧？我们知道这些志愿不是空想。只要我们努力，我们一定能做到的。
    我们这班现在是全校的最高班了，小同学都叫我们大哥哥大姊姊。我们也常常帮助他们。譬如给他们修理桌椅啦，擦玻璃啦，修理他们的书包啦。我们又帮助二年级的小同学成立了图书馆。下课时，我们给同学们讲故事，教他们唱歌、跳舞。我们学校的同学，都像一个妈妈生的一样那样亲爱。
    从今年一月一日起，我们班天天写“红领巾班日记”。每天放学后五分钟，全班讨论一下，把重要事情都记上。我们常常提醒大家要记起我们“红领巾班”的集体荣誉。比如，有时两个队员闹蹩扭啦，有个别队员不听老师的话啦，看不好的旧小人书啦，我们就在“红领巾班日记”上提出批评。这样，我们的缺点很快就能改正过来。
    亲爱的叔叔们，我们在这一年中，虽然有这些进步，但是我们决不骄傲自满。我们还要继续努力。我们全体队员都下了决心，一定好好学习，时刻准备着，为建设我们伟大的祖国、为实现毛主席的伟大理想而奋斗！向你们致最亲爱的少年儿童队敬礼！
                                              五月三十一日
