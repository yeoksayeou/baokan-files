Xinjiang Military Region's Yang Fuchen and Chen Youlu High-Yield Groups
Challenge High-Yield Models Qu Yaoli, Yang Zhenru, etc.
    The Yang Fuchen rice high-yield group and the Chen Youlu cotton high-yield group of the People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region, who are actively participating in agricultural production, warmly responded to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government for the 1952 patriotic production increase competition, and challenged the mutual aid organizations led by rice high-yield models Yang Zhenru, Zou Yubin, Chen Yongkang, and Li Chenggui, and the mutual aid organizations led by cotton high-yield models Qu Yaoli, Wu Xuanwen, and Zhang Defang. The following is the main content of their challenge letters:

    Yang Fuchen Rice High-Yield Group Challenge Letter
    Our entire group of three people cultivates 75 mu of rice, of which 70 mu will strive to achieve an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu.

    Our high-yield methods are: Before spring plowing, clear the reeds and clean the field surface (we are planting reed lake wasteland), apply base fertilizer (sheep manure) at 3,000 jin per mu, and deeply plow the land once immediately after thawing (plowing depth of 18 to 20 centimeters) to allow the soil to be fully exposed to the sun and weathered. Before planting, harrow once and then shallowly plow once, harrowing both vertically and horizontally; level the ground, build field ridges, irrigate and soak the soil, and then scoop out the grass roots, and then mix water and sow (point sowing), implement dense planting (row spacing of 15 to 20 centimeters, more than 15 seeds per hole). In field management, achieve topdressing twice, each time topdressing with 2,000 jin of green manure (bitter beans) per mu, cultivate (weeding and stepping on mud) three times, and drain water three times (combined with cultivation). In irrigation work, regulate the amount of water in a timely and appropriate manner, maintain a water depth of 5 centimeters during the seedling stage, and maintain a water depth of 3 centimeters during the growth stage; after the rice panicles are grouted and the panicles droop, drain the water immediately to promote early maturity, achieve full grains, good quality, and guarantee the victory of creating a high-yield record.

    Chen Youlu Cotton High-Yield Group Challenge Letter
    Our entire group of three people cultivates 40 mu of cotton land, and each mu must achieve an average yield of 750 jin of seed cotton, of which 3 mu must achieve 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    In order to achieve the planned harvest, we must do the following: 1. Select the Soviet "C, 3173" cotton seeds and plant 6,660 to 7,000 seedlings per mu; 2. Deep plowing and fine cultivation, staged irrigation, each piece of land has agricultural canals to ensure sufficient moisture during the cotton seedling growth; 3. Apply base fertilizer with an average of 4,000 jin of sheep manure per mu. Topdressing three times, each time an average of 1,000 jin of sheep manure, 5,000 jin of oil residue, and 10 jin of bone fertilizer are mixed and used per mu. The topdressing time should be combined with washing the water to prevent burning the cotton. 4. Strictly prevent pests and diseases, prepare sufficient medicines for prevention and treatment. 5. Pick and dry the cotton to be pure and clean. Thoroughly separate the first flower, the second flower, and the frost flower. Harvest and store separately. And select seeds in the field to ensure next year's cotton yield.

    Note: The various troops of the Xinjiang Military Region participating in agricultural production are investing in production with a high degree of patriotism in order to build the frontier of the motherland, striving for a bumper harvest of various agricultural crops this year. The troops to which the Yang Fuchen Rice High-Yield Group and the Chen Youlu Cotton High-Yield Group belong completed the sowing of more than 110,000 mu of spring wheat in mid-April, and then started planting rice and cotton intensively. All units held production meetings and formed many rice planting groups and cotton planting groups according to each person's specialties. The groups challenged each other, creating a surge of patriotic production increase competition.

    新疆军区杨甫臣、陈友禄丰产小组
    向曲耀离杨振儒等丰产模范应战
    积极参加农业生产的人民解放军新疆军区杨甫臣水稻丰产小组和陈友禄棉花丰产小组，热烈响应中央人民政府农业部一九五二年爱国增产竞赛号召，分别向水稻丰产模范杨振儒、邹玉彬、陈永康、李承桂领导的各个互助组织和棉花丰产模范曲耀离、吴宣文、张德芳领导的互助组织应战。下面是他们的应战书的主要内容：
    杨甫臣水稻丰产小组应战书
    我们全组三人种水稻七十五亩，其中七十亩每亩平均产量要争取达到二千斤。
    我们的丰产办法是：在春耕前打净苇草清洁田面（种的是苇湖荒地），上基肥（羊粪）每亩三千斤，化冻后立刻将地深耕一次（犁深十八至二十公分），使土壤得到充分曝晒和风化。临种前耙一次再浅犁一次，纵横各耙一次；整平地面打好田梗，灌水泡土，再捞净草根，然后混水播种（点种），施行密植（窝距十五公分至二十公分，每窝十五粒以上）。在田间管理上，作到追肥二次，每次每亩追绿肥（苦豆子）二千斤，中耕（拔草踩泥）三次，排水三次（和中耕结合进行）。在灌溉工作上，做到适时适度地调节水量，在幼苗期保持水深五公分，在生长期保持水深三公分；稻穗灌浆后，穗下垂，即行排水，促成早熟，达到籽粒饱满，品质良好，保证创造丰产纪录的胜利。
    陈友禄棉花丰产小组应战书
    我们全组三人种棉地四十亩、每亩平均要达到产籽花七百五十斤，其中三亩要达到每亩产籽花一千斤。
    为达到预定收获量，我们要做到：一、选用苏联“Ｃ、三一七三”棉种、每亩植苗六六六○株到七○○○株；二、深耕细作，分期灌溉，每块地边都有农渠，以使棉苗生长中水分充足；三、施底肥每亩平均羊肥四千斤。追肥三次，每次平均每亩一千斤羊肥、五千斤油渣、十斤骨肥混合使用。追肥时间应和洗水相结合，以防烧死棉花。四、严密防止病虫害，准备足够的药剂，进行预防和治疗。五、收花、晒花做到纯洁、干净。彻底分别头花、二花、霜后花。分别收获，分别贮藏。并做到田间选种、以保证明年的棉花产量。
    按：新疆军区参加农业生产的各部队，为建设祖国的边疆，正以高度的爱国主义的热情投入生产，争取今年各种农业作物丰产。杨甫臣水稻丰产小组和陈友禄棉花丰产小组所在的部队，于四月中旬完成了十一万亩以上的春麦播种工作以后，即紧张地种植水稻和棉花。各单位都召开了生产会议，按各人特长分别组成许多种稻小组和植棉小组。各小组互相提出挑战应战，兴起了爱国增产的竞赛热潮。
