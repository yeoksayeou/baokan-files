    Celebrating the Great Victory of the Korean War Against America
    Xu Deheng

    June 25th of this year marks the second anniversary of the US imperialists' launch of the Korean War of aggression, and also the great anniversary of the Korean people's two-year war against American aggression. The World Federation of Trade Unions has declared this day as the International Day of Action in Solidarity with the Korean People and for the Defense of Peace, calling on the working people of the world to commemorate this day, which has extremely important practical political significance.

    For two years, the heroic Korean People's Army has written an immortal page in the epic of mankind's struggle for freedom. Their struggle has dealt a fatal blow to the US imperialists' sinister plan to expand the war of aggression, giving new strength and confidence to every people fighting against imperialist rule. After the outstanding sons and daughters of our people – the heroic Volunteers – fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, they fundamentally changed the situation of the Korean War, plunging the US aggressors into a quagmire of defeat from which they cannot extricate themselves. The great contribution of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to safeguarding Asian security and world peace is unparalleled. Therefore, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War against America today, we must first pay tribute to the Korean People's Army and its wise leader, General Kim Il-sung! Pay tribute to the Chinese People's Volunteers! Pay tribute to the martyrs who died in the Korean War against America!

    From the very beginning of the war, it was clear that the purpose of US imperialism was not simply to conquer Korea, but to expand the war of aggression and drag the people of the whole world into the flames of war. A few days before the war broke out, US Secretary of State's Special Advisor and warmonger Dulles delivered a speech at the South Korean puppet "National Assembly," openly clamoring that the United States was "willing to provide spiritual and material support to South Korea in the struggle against communism." On the third day after the outbreak of the war, US President Truman ordered the large-scale invasion of Korea by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, and at the same time announced the occupation of our territory Taiwan and the strengthening of armed intervention in the Philippines and Vietnam. From the outset, it showed that US imperialism wanted to imitate the old tricks of Mussolini, Hitler, and the Japanese militarists in attacking Spain, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as Manchuria, using the aggression against Korea as a prelude to an attack on the entire Asia. But US imperialism has made extreme errors in its assessment of the current world situation and the strength of the Korean people. Today's world situation is very different from the past, and Korea will never become a second Spain, nor a second Manchuria. The facts of the past two years have shown the people of the world a truth, that is, unjust and unpopular wars are doomed to failure; and the US aggression against Korea is an unjust and extremely unpopular war.

    Imperialist warmongers will never learn the lessons they deserve from failure. They only know how to play with fire everywhere, but they never recognize the irrefutable truth that "those who play with fire will be burned." The US aggressors have forgotten that they spent tens of billions of dollars on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but could not reverse the lesson of their failure in China; now they have come to support Syngman Rhee—who is just the Chiang Kai-shek of Korea—vainly trying to use this puppet's army to maintain imperialist rule in a corner of the Far East. They forgot that lesson: that no puppet army supported by foreign countries can withstand the people's army fighting for the survival of their motherland. Not only that, but the US aggressors are also painstakingly arming Japan and West Germany, organizing the European invasion army; continuing to support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fleeing to Taiwan; organizing the Pacific invasion group, and frantically preparing for new military adventures. Under this situation, the people of the world must unite and act urgently to extinguish the flames of war. That is to say, all peace-loving people must use their greatest strength to support the Korean people's war against aggression, stop the US aggressors from using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, oppose the heinous crimes of the US executioners who are abusing captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and exert all pressure to force the US aggressors to lay down their weapons in the face of justice and righteousness and reach an agreement on the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The Chinese people deeply love peace. At the same time, the Chinese people deeply recognize that peace cannot be waited for, it must be striven for. Therefore, the Chinese people have launched a vigorous movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, and on a voluntary basis, they have sent their outstanding sons and daughters to Korea to resist atrocities and stop aggression together with the Korean people. The reason why this righteous action of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies has achieved great victory and won the support and cheers of the people of the world is because this action conforms to the will and interests of the people of the world and meets the just demands of the people of the world to resist aggression and defend peace.

    Imperialist wars of aggression are global in nature. Therefore, the struggle of any country or nation to resist aggression and fight for freedom and liberation is not a local event at any time or place, but is closely related to the well-being of all mankind. We should regard the Korean people's war against aggression as an inseparable part of the world's people's struggle for peace, and as an inseparable part of the struggle to protect our own survival and security from infringement. We must closely link the struggle for the complete victory of the Korean War against America with the struggle for world peace, and promote the great spirit of patriotism and internationalism.

    Therefore, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War against America, this glorious and sacred anniversary, we must follow the instructions of Marshal Stalin: take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end. We must resolutely oppose the US imperialists' sinister plan to use the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan to arm Japan and revive Japanese fascism; thoroughly smash the US imperialists' vicious conspiracy to occupy our territory Taiwan, continue to support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and be hostile to the Chinese people; we must resolutely stop the US imperialists' heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare in Korea and our territory, and resolutely stop the bloody atrocities of the US imperialist executioners who are abusing our captured personnel. We must take action to support the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, which is unanimously expected by the people of the world, so that the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific region will become a magnificent torrent and completely extinguish the flames of the war of aggression ignited by US imperialism in Korea.

    As we celebrate the great victory of the Korean War against America today, the members of our Jiusan Society and people from the national cultural, educational, and scientific circles must take more active actions to continue to support the heroic Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteers in their fight to win the final victory of the Korean War against America and to defend the security of our motherland and Asia and lasting world peace.

    Long live the victory of the Korean people's war against America!
    Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

    庆祝朝鲜抗美战争的伟大胜利
    许德珩
    今年的六月二十五日是美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争两周年的日子，也是朝鲜人民抗美战争两周年的伟大的纪念日。世界工会联合会把这一天宣布为国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日，号召世界劳动人民纪念这个日子，是具有极其重大的现实政治意义的。
    两年以来，英勇的朝鲜人民军在人类争取自由的史诗上，写下了不朽的一页。他们的斗争，使美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的罪恶计划受到了致命的打击，给反抗帝国主义统治斗争中的每个人民以新的力量和信心。而在我国人民的优秀儿女——英勇的志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战以后，更从基本上改变了朝鲜战争的局势，使美国侵略者陷在失败的深渊中，不能自拔。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对保卫亚洲安全和世界和平所作的伟大的贡献，是无可比拟的。因之，当纪念朝鲜抗美战争两周年的今天，我们首先要向朝鲜人民军及其英明的领袖金日成将军致敬！向中国人民志愿军致敬！向在朝鲜抗美战争中死难的烈士们致敬！
    战争一开始就很明白，美帝国主义的目的并不简单地在于征服朝鲜，而是想扩大侵略战争，把全世界人民都拖入战争火网中去。当战争发动的前几天，美国国务卿特别顾问、战争贩子杜勒斯，就在南朝鲜傀儡“国会”发表演说，公然叫嚣美国“对于在与共产主义斗争中的南朝鲜，愿给予精神的和物质的支持”。在战争爆发后的第三天，美国总统杜鲁门即下令派遣美国陆海空军大举侵入朝鲜，同时并宣布占领我国领土台湾和加强对菲律宾、越南的武装干涉。事情一开始就显示了：美帝国主义想效墨索里尼、希特勒和日本军阀当年进攻西班牙、奥地利和捷克以及满洲的故技，以侵略朝鲜为向整个亚洲进攻的序幕。但美帝国主义对于今天的世界形势和朝鲜人民力量的估计，都陷于极端的错误。今天的世界形势已经和以前大大的不同了，朝鲜也决不会成为第二个西班牙，不会成为第二个满洲。两年来的事实给全世界人民指示了一条真理，即非正义的、不得人心的战争，是注定了要失败的；而美国侵略朝鲜的战争正是一种非正义的、极端不得人心的战争。
    帝国主义战争贩子永远不会从失败中接受应得的教训。他们只知道到处玩火，但永远不认识“玩火者将自焚”这个颠扑不破的真理。美国侵略者忘记了它在蒋介石匪帮身上花了几十亿美元，并不能挽回它在中国失败的教训；现在它又来支持李承晚—这不过是朝鲜的蒋介石，妄想以这个傀儡的军队来维持帝国主义在远东一角的统治。他们忘记了那个教训：任何外国支持的傀儡军队都抵挡不了为自己祖国生存而战的人民军队。不但如此，美国侵略者还在处心积虑地武装日本和西德，组织欧洲侵略军；继续支持逃在台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮；组织太平洋侵略集团，疯狂地准备进行新的军事冒险。在这种形势之下，全世界人民就必须一致紧急地行动起来，扑灭战争的火焰。这就是说，一切爱好和平的人民必须用最大的力量来支援朝鲜人民的反侵略战争，制止美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，反对美国刽子手们虐杀中朝人民军队的被俘人员的滔天罪行，施用一切压力迫使美国侵略者不得不在公理和正义面前放下它的武器，达成朝鲜停战谈判的协议。
    中国人民是酷爱和平的。中国人民同时深刻地认识：和平绝对不能等待，必须努力去争取。因之，中国人民发动了如火如荼的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并且在志愿的基础上派遣了自己的优秀儿女到朝鲜去，和朝鲜人民一道，抵抗暴行，制止侵略。中朝人民军队这种正义行动之所以获得伟大的胜利，之所以博得全世界人民的拥护和欢呼，是因为这种行动符合了全世界人民的意志和利益，符合了全世界人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的正义要求。
    帝国主义的侵略战争是具有世界性的。因之，任何一个国家或民族反抗侵略、争取自由解放的斗争，也就不是一时一地的局部性的事件，而是和整个人类的祸福息息相关的。我们对于朝鲜人民反抗侵略的战争，应视为全世界人民争取和平斗争的不可分的一部分，视为保卫自己的生存和安全不受侵害的斗争的不可分的一部分。我们要把争取朝鲜抗美战争的彻底胜利和争取世界和平的斗争紧密地联系起来，发挥爱国主义和国际主义的伟大精神。
    因此，当我们纪念朝鲜抗美战争两周年这一光荣神圣的纪念日的今天，我们必须遵照斯大林大元帅的指示：将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底。我们要坚决反对美帝国主义利用非法的单独对日和约来武装日本、复活日本法西斯主义的罪恶计划；彻底粉碎美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾、继续支持蒋介石残余匪帮、敌视中国人民的恶毒阴谋；我们要坚决制止美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国领土上进行细菌战的滔天罪行，坚决制止美帝国主义刽子手们虐杀我方被俘人员的血腥暴行。我们要采取行动来拥护全世界人民所一致瞩望的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，使亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动变成一支波澜壮阔的巨流，把美帝国主义在朝鲜所燃起的侵略战争的火焰彻底扑灭下去。
    当我们庆祝朝鲜抗美战争的伟大胜利的今天，我们九三学社的社员和全国文教科学界人士，更要采取积极的行动，继续支援英勇战斗中的朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军，以争取朝鲜抗美战争的最后胜利，保卫祖国和亚洲的安全及世界的持久和平。
    朝鲜人民抗美战争胜利万岁！
    牢不可破的中朝人民兄弟般的友谊万岁！
