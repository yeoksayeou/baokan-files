    Cultural Briefs
    ▲ The Central Academy of Drama and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Club Work Section, jointly organized 89 students from the academy's undergraduate opera, drama, and stage art departments in mid-April for factory internship and guidance. They were assigned to 23 state-owned and private factories and mines in Shijingshan, Changxindian, Mentougou, Liulihe, Qinghe, and other areas. Their main tasks were: 1. To establish amateur worker literary and artistic organizations and cultivate literary and artistic backbones in directing, acting, and art. 2. To assist workers and collaborate with them in script creation, addressing the issue of script scarcity in the workers' amateur drama movement, and also improving workers' creative abilities. Thanks to the enthusiasm of the workers and the efforts of the guiding comrades, a total of 37 scripts of various sizes were produced. These scripts were jointly organized for discussion by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Academy of Drama, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Script Monthly, and Beijing People's Broadcasting Station to assist worker authors in making revisions. Among them, many were relatively excellent creations. The many new heroic figures and deeds generated by the Red May production emulation and "finding shortcuts" campaign powerfully encouraged their creative enthusiasm, while the factory's literary and artistic propaganda powerfully encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. According to workers, the guidance was helpful to them. Most of the comrades who went to the factories returned to the academy in early June and are now summarizing the factory literary and artistic guidance work.

    ▲中央戏剧学院和北京市总工会文教部俱乐部工作科在四月中旬曾联合组织该院本科歌剧系、话剧系、舞台美术系同学八十九人下厂实习辅导，分配到石景山、长辛店、门头沟、琉璃河、清河等二十三个公私营厂矿中。主要任务是：一、建立工人业余文艺组织，培养导演、演员、美术方面的文艺骨干。二、帮助工人并和他们一起进行剧本创作，解决工人业余戏剧运动中剧本荒的问题，同时也提高工人的创作能力。由于工人的热情和辅导同志的努力，产生了大小剧本共三十七个。这些剧本并由北京市总工会文教部俱乐部工作科、中央戏剧学院、北京市文学艺术界联合会、剧本月刊社、北京人民广播电台等单位共同组织讨论，协助工人作者进行修改。其中有不少是比较优秀的创作。这次红五月生产大竞赛、找窍门运动所产生的许多新英雄人物和事迹，有力地鼓舞了他们的创作情绪，而工厂文艺宣传又有力地鼓舞着工人的生产热情。据工人们反映，这次辅导对他们是有帮助的。下厂的同志大部于六月初返校，现正进行下厂文艺辅导工作总结。
