To all workers and comrades of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises in the North China region:

In order to realize Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the North China Administrative Committee have issued instructions to the entire region to launch a production increase and thrift campaign. The North China Administrative Committee has also convened a region-wide industrial production competition conference. This is very correct and timely, and we warmly support it. Launching such a region-wide, universally surging patriotic production increase and thrift campaign will greatly increase labor productivity, promote production reform, strengthen economic construction and the power to resist America and aid Korea, improve the material and cultural life of workers and the broad masses of working people, and prepare for large-scale economic construction. We call on all 2.5 million workers in the region to act quickly, with a high sense of ownership and patriotism, to actively participate in this movement, to earnestly ensure safe production, to vigorously increase the quantity and quality of products, to save raw materials, reduce costs, and lower product prices, and to strive to complete and exceed the glorious task of increasing production and practicing thrift worth four trillion yuan!

Union members and all workers in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises should seriously discuss and formulate realistic and progressive production increase and thrift plans for the entire factory, workshop, department, team, and individual. Based on the different conditions of the enterprises, specify concrete goals, and incorporate the main contents of the plans into patriotic covenants to ensure the daily, weekly, and monthly completion of production increase and thrift tasks. Consciously abide by labor discipline, diligently study advanced production, technology, and management experience, especially Soviet experience, and strive to improve technical and professional levels. Give full play to labor enthusiasm and creativity, use your brains, and launch rationalization proposals and "finding the knack" movements in connection with key issues in production. Fully explore the potential of enterprises, continuously improve labor productivity, do a good job in quota work, and implement the economic accounting system.

All labor models and advanced workers should continue to play a leading role, a bridging role, and a backbone role, humbly learn, unite and organize the broad masses to continuously create new production achievements, do a good job in the production increase and thrift movement, and always maintain the glorious title of labor model and advanced worker!

All members of the Youth League and young workers should give full play to their leading role in the production movement, work hard to learn technology, respect their masters, and strive to become models of hard work in production, hard work in learning, improving technology, and mastering business!

All female workers should work hard to study political, cultural, and especially technical knowledge, pay attention to hygiene, maintain good health, promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and strive to become models on the production front!

All staff and technical personnel should become active participants and organizers of the movement, and strive to do their own work well. Further clarify the idea of relying on the working class, timely answer and deal with the suggestions put forward by employees on production, technology, safety, business management and life. Go deep into the workshops and groups to help workers solve specific problems in production and technology, improve technical level, strengthen political study, and overcome conservative ideas, bourgeois ideas, and pro-American views.

All family members of employees should actively organize, work hard to study political, cultural and health knowledge, improve class consciousness, promote the spirit of mutual assistance, manage household affairs well, take good care of children, and assist employees in completing production increase and thrift tasks!

Workers in private enterprises, after opposing the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists, should unite with the capitalists to do a good job in production, and develop competition in a planned way according to the conditions and circumstances of the enterprise!

Trade union organizations, Youth League organizations, and women's organizations at all levels should, under the leadership of the Party, do a good job in regular ideological mobilization and political agitation. Go deep into the workshops and groups to cultivate and establish typical examples, timely summarize and promote advanced experiences, help employees solve various difficulties encountered in the movement, and care for the masses' lives. Assist the administration to improve safety equipment in a planned way, strengthen safety and health education for employees, eliminate responsibility accidents, and reduce employee illnesses. Rationally use labor insurance funds and enterprise reward funds to solve the needs of the masses of employees that can be solved. Assist the administration in running canteens, health canteens, nurseries, breastfeeding rooms, etc., to ensure that employees can concentrate on production.

All workers and comrades, take action! Let us strive to better ensure supplies to the front lines and strive for the speedy arrival of the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea! Let us strive to supply our peasant brothers and all the people with more and better cheap goods! Let us strive to greet the high tide of economic construction and accelerate the process of national industrialization! Let us strive to become labor models and model units!
