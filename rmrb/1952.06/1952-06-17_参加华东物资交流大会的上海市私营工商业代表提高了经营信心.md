At the East China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Conference, private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai have purchased various local and specialty products worth more than 215.7 billion yuan, accounting for 12 percent of the total purchases at the conference. They sold various industrial products worth 288.4 billion yuan, accounting for 45.85 percent of the total sales of public and private enterprises in Shanghai at the conference.

Due to the education of the "Five-Anti" campaign and the correct leadership of the state-owned economy at the conference, the representatives of private enterprises in Shanghai participating in the exchange demonstrated some new business styles. At this exchange conference, everyone actively purchased slow-selling products under the principle of "seeking truth from facts, mutual assistance and mutual benefit." For example, Shanghai pharmaceutical companies have purchased 700,000 jin of slow-selling medicinal materials from Inner Mongolia, Pingyuan, Shandong, and other places, worth 3 billion yuan, accounting for more than 40 percent of the industry's total purchases. Another example is the sugar business, which used to be an industry with serious speculative practices. This time, they purchased all seasonal slow-selling products – local sugar. They played a considerable role in helping Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places to break the deadlock of slow-selling local sugar. In order to help North Jiangsu and other places open up the sales of cotton seed oil, the representatives of the miscellaneous grains and oil cake industry vigorously promoted it to their peers, expanding the original plan of purchasing 536 dan of cotton seed oil to 6,552 dan. These new business styles are very different from last year; at last year's Shanghai Materials Exchange Conference, many people in Shanghai's native product industry blindly rushed to buy fast-selling goods, but never inquired about slow-selling goods. In addition, the phenomenon of "telling lies everywhere and bargaining on the spot" in pursuit of exorbitant profits has also been basically eliminated in this transaction. Some transactions were negotiated and concluded in just a few minutes, and both parties to the transaction could reasonably calculate costs and profits. Through this exchange conference, many difficulties have been solved for private enterprises in Shanghai. The Shanghai paper-making industry purchased more than 33,000 tons of bamboo pulp at the conference, ensuring the supply of raw materials in the future. According to statistics as of June 7, the sales volume of the underwear weaving industry exceeded the plan by 47 times, the knitting industry by 10 times, the toothbrush and nail-making industry by 4 times, and the shirt, clothing, and dyeing industries by 10 times. The sales volume of other industries such as mirror making, scissors, soap, towels, and rubber has more than doubled. Some of these industries were originally facing the off-season and were shut down or reducing production, but now they have been able to resume or increase production due to the sale of inventory and the acceptance of orders.

The huge purchasing power of the domestic market shown by this East China Materials Exchange Conference, and the government's policy of developing production for the benefit of both public and private sectors, greatly encouraged private industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai. The representatives of private industrial and commercial enterprises participating in the conference all believe that legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises that have eliminated the "five evils," as long as they face the countryside and serve urban and rural exchanges, have a future. Especially with the peak sales season coming after the autumn harvest, due to the development of the rural economy, business this autumn will definitely be better than last year. Yao Siwei, the representative of the handkerchief industry, said: "According to the statistics of production and sales figures of this industry during the peak season of 1951 and the ratio of the national population, it is only enough for eleven people to use one handkerchief per year. But judging from the situation of this exchange, our outdated stocks that have been shelved for more than ten years have also been sold out. If every person in the country uses one handkerchief per year, we will have to expand production tenfold. This day is coming." The cultural and educational supplies industry received a large number of orders for basketballs, volleyballs, toys, musical instruments, and playing cards from the Northeast and other places. Orders received by three-quarters of the toy manufacturers require production until July 15. The industry was surprised and excited by the rapid increase in the demand for cultural and recreational products after the improvement of the lives of workers and peasants in various places.

    参加华东物资交流大会的上海市私营工商业代表提高了经营信心
    新华社记者  张家炽
    在华东区城乡物资交流大会中，上海市私营工商业已买进各种土产、特产品共值人民币二千一百五十七亿多元，占大会购入总额的百分之十二；销出各种工业品共值人民币二千八百八十四亿元，占大会中上海市公私营企业销出总额的百分之四十五点八五。
    由于“五反”运动的教育和大会中国营经济的正确领导，上海市私营企业参加交流的代表表现了一些新的经营作风。在这次交流大会中，大家都在“实事求是、互助互利”的方针下积极购进滞销品。例如，上海药材商业已买进内蒙、平原、山东等地滞销药材七十万斤，合人民币三十亿元，占该业购进总值的百分之四十以上。再如糖商业，过去是一个带有严重投机作风的行业，这次他们买进的全部是季节性滞销品——土糖。他们在帮助福建、浙江等地打开土糖滞销局面中起了相当的作用。杂粮油饼业代表为了帮助苏北等地打开棉清油的销路，大力向同业推销，把原来购进棉清油五百三十六担的计划扩大到六千五百五十二担。这些新的经营作风和去年比较已大不相同；在去年上海市物资交流大会上，上海市土产行业不少人对畅销货盲目抢购，滞销货却从不问津。另外，在这次交易中，为了追求暴利而“满天耍谎、就地还价”的现象也基本上消灭，有的交易仅在数分钟内便谈妥成交，而交易双方都能合理地计算了成本和利润。通过这次交流大会，为上海的私营企业解决了许多困难。上海的造纸工业在大会中购到三万三千多吨竹浆，保证了今后原料的供应。到六月七日的统计：内衣织造业销售数超过计划四十七倍，针织业超过十倍，牙刷、制钉业超过四倍，衬衫、服装、染织等工业超过十倍。其他如制镜、刀剪、肥皂、毛巾、橡胶等工业销售量都超过一倍、两倍不等。这些行业原来有的正遇到淡季而停工减产，现在因销出了存货，接受了定货，得以恢复或提高了生产。
    这次华东物资交流大会所显示的国内市场的巨大购买力，和人民政府公私两利发展生产的政策，大大鼓舞了上海的私营工商业者。参加大会的私营工商业的代表都相信：经过消除“五毒”的正当工商业只要面向农村，为城乡交流服务，是有前途的。特别是秋后旺销季节即将到来，由于农村经济发展，今年秋后生意一定比去年还要好。手帕工业的代表姚思伟说：“根据本业一九五一年旺季时产销数字统计与全国人口比，只够十一个人每年合用一条手帕。但从这次交流情况看，我们那些花色过时搁了十多年的存货也卖完了。如果全国人民每年每人用一条手帕，我们就要扩大十倍产量。这种日子就要到来的。”文教用品业这次接到东北等地大批篮球、排球、玩具、乐器、扑克牌的定货，玩具业四分之三的厂家所接定货要生产到七月十五日。该业对各地工人农民生活改善后对于文化生活用品需要量的迅速激增，都感到惊异和兴奋。
