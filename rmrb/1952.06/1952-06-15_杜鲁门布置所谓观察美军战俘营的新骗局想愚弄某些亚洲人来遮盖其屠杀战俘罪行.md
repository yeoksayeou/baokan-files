Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th: As the American army's atrocities of massacring captured Korean and Chinese personnel have aroused great anger among the people of Asia, U.S. President Truman is hurriedly deploying a new scam. According to an Associated Press report from Washington on June 11th, Truman "suggested inviting military personnel from five neutral countries," including India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, to "observe the United Nations' treatment of Communist prisoners of war" at U.S. POW camps in Korea. Observers familiar with the POW issue here pointed out: Any Asian with self-respect will never be fooled by the American aggressors; Truman's clumsy trick of trying to use Asians to cover up their crimes of massacring Asians will only increase the Asian people's hatred and contempt for U.S. imperialism.

The American imperialists, who inherit Hitler's theory of racial superiority, have never regarded the Asian people as human beings. Their contempt, insult, persecution, and massacre of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are exactly the same as the Nazi methods of eliminating "inferior races." The outrageous facts are countless and endless. When both sides exchanged POW lists last December, our side provided complete and accurate materials in the native languages of each POW to the U.S. side, while the U.S. side only gave us a garbled English transliteration of the names of our POWs, without listing ranks or units. This so-called list was completely unrecognizable and tantamount to a pile of waste paper. This is by no means an accidental event. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that American executioners arbitrarily kill unarmed Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. According to recent reports from Geoje Island by American news agencies, their guns can "accidentally discharge" at any time and kill POWs; they can open fire on POWs for executing the order of "not allowing washed clothes to be hung up"; they can immediately pull out their guns and shoot down several people just because they don't like the POWs singing. They can even carry out large-scale collective massacres at will. As recently as June 10th, American troops equipped with tanks, flamethrowers, grenades, and poison gas, under the eyes of the world, killed more than 30 POWs, seriously injured about 140, and slightly injured about 100 within two hours. The Korean and Chinese people have grasped accurate materials and evidence regarding other more concealed torture and killings in U.S. prisoner of war camps, such as bacterial experiments, steam rooms, gas chambers, tearing limbs apart, electrocution, blinding eyes, and other Eastern Auschwitz methods.

Observers pointed out: The bloody practices of U.S. imperialism have shocked the entire Asia. The era in which the awakened Asian people were fooled by imperialism is gone forever. It is impossible for the American aggressors to find anyone to shield their heinous crimes.

    杜鲁门布置所谓观察美军战俘营的新骗局想愚弄某些亚洲人来遮盖其屠杀战俘罪行
    【新华社开城十四日电】当美军屠杀朝中被俘人员的暴行，已经激起亚洲人民极大愤怒的时候，美国总统杜鲁门正仓忙布置一个新的骗局。据美联社华盛顿十一日消息，杜鲁门“建议邀请五个中立国家的军人”，包括印度、巴基斯坦和印尼，到朝鲜美军战俘营“观察联合国对共产党战俘的待遇”。此间熟悉战俘问题的观察家指出：任何具有自尊心的亚洲人，绝不会受美国侵略者的愚弄；杜鲁门这一个想用亚洲人遮盖他们屠杀亚洲人罪行的拙劣花招，只会增强亚洲人民对美帝国主义的仇恨与鄙夷。
    承继希特勒种族优越论的美帝国主义者，是从来不把亚洲人民当人的。他们对朝中战俘的轻视、侮辱、迫害及虐杀，与纳粹消灭“劣等民族”的办法如出一辙。令人愤慨的事实是数不尽、说不完的。去年十二月双方交换战俘名单时，我方以各战俘的本国文字开列完整详确的材料，交给美方，而美方却只把我方战俘的名字用英文胡乱拼出，交给我方，不列级别，不列部属，这批所谓名单，完全不能辨识，等于一堆废纸。这绝不是偶然事件。而美国刽子手任意杀害手无寸铁的朝中战俘，这已是尽人皆知的事实。根据美国通讯社最近发自巨济岛的报道，他们的枪可以随时“走火”而打死战俘；他们可以为执行“不许把洗过的衣服挂起来”的命令而开枪向战俘射击；他们可以因为不高兴战俘唱歌，就立刻拔出枪来打倒几个人。他们甚至于可以任意进行大规模的集体屠杀。近如六月十日，配有坦克、喷火器、手榴弹、毒瓦斯的美国军队，在举世瞩目之下，两小时内打死战俘三十余人，重伤约一百四十人，轻伤约一百人。关于其他较隐蔽的美方俘虏营内的酷刑与杀害，如像细菌实验、蒸气间、毒气室、撕裂四肢、电刑、弄瞎眼睛等东方奥斯威辛的办法，朝中人民都掌握了确实的材料与证据。
    观察家指出：美帝国主义的血腥做法，已经震动了整个亚洲。已经觉醒了的亚洲人民受帝国主义愚弄的时代已经一去不复返了。美国侵略者想要找人包庇他们的滔天罪行，是不可能的。
