    A warrior in the vanguard of the proletariat is inevitably a patriot, and also inevitably an internationalist. Comrade Qu Qiubai was not only a pioneer and one of the political leaders of the Chinese people's revolution, but also an outstanding revolutionary writer. Under the extremely brutal persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he unyieldingly used his sharp, fiery pen to expose all the despicable and shameless deception of the people by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to propagate the truth to the masses. In "War Literature," written in March 1932, he said: "Japanese workers oppose the Japanese bourgeoisie sending troops to fight China, while the Chinese working people and soldiers must drive back the troops sent by the Japanese bourgeoisie... This is the revolutionary internationalist stance, which is the only path to Chinese national liberation." At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries were intensifying the "Red and White War" and, with the support of imperialism, were preparing to provoke the Soviet Union. At that time, the Kuomintang's reactionary literature, "used all shameless and base rumors and curses to help the White Army's guns and cannons attack the people, attack the workers, and attack the country that was already building socialism. The working people, on the other hand, could actively oppose the White Army and oppose the attack on the Soviet Union, because the war against the White Army and the war in support of the Soviet Union are the working people's own war, for the liberation of the working people. The attitude of revolutionary literature and proletarian literature towards war is naturally the attitude of the working people under the leadership of the working class."
    Qu Qiubai's enthusiastic advocacy and introduction of Soviet literature was not a general, indifferent, art-for-art's-sake study work, but a solemn political struggle inextricably linked to the flesh and blood of a staunch warrior, a fiery patriot, and an internationalist in the vanguard of the Chinese proletariat. The purpose of his work was to lead China onto the most glorious path of mankind: the path of socialism and communism.
    Qu Qiubai initially studied at the Russian Language Institute in Beijing. During the "May Fourth" era, he began to introduce short stories by the Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Gogol from the original texts. He was one of the first few people to introduce Russian literary works directly from the original texts. Before him, there were probably no introductions of Russian literature from the original texts.
    After the October Revolution, Qu Qiubai was also one of the first four people to go to Soviet Russia. Because he already had a foundation in Russian in China, it was very convenient for him to read things there. However, his health was very poor, especially with a very serious lung disease. At that time, the doctor said that one of his lungs was already rotten and that he could only last for three or four years at most. But his mood was very heroic and optimistic! An internationalist who affirmed the light could not but be heroic and optimistic! At that time, he worked tirelessly, regardless of everything. He compared the Soviet Union to a treasure mountain of revolutionary treasures, and he wanted to risk his short life to move as many of those revolutionary treasures to China as possible. For a period of time, he was too sick to get out of bed, so he tied the lamp to the bed frame and leaned over the pillow to write. At that time, the Soviet Union was heavily blockaded by capitalist countries, and strange rumors were spread in various countries around the world. The actual situation of the Soviet Union was almost a "world mystery" in the minds of most people at that time. And Qu Qiubai desperately tried to convey the "humanization of communism" (the title of one of Qu Qiubai's dispatches), the actual situation of the Soviet Union, the Soviet system, etc., through the heavy fog spread by capitalism, to the Chinese people fighting for liberation, and to the freedom-seeking workers of the world. He wanted to expose the rumors of the imperialists and tear off the masks of the imperialists in front of the Chinese working people and the working people of the world, so that everyone could distinguish between friend and foe, recognize the road, and not be fooled by those bloodsuckers!
    At that time – from 1921 to 1922 – in addition to regularly writing reports on the actual situation in the Soviet Union, he also wrote "New Russian Travel Notes" and "Red Capital Heart History," where he fully praised Soviet literature, art, as well as the social system and social life.
    In October 1923, in an article titled "The First Swallow of the New Literary Era in Red Russia," he said, "The Russian Revolution not only opened a new era in world political history, but also opened up a new path for human culture." He also believed that "true culture is only the culture of the proletariat." At that time, he had returned to China and was the editor-in-chief of the "New Youth Quarterly" in Beijing. At the same time, he was also translating "The Internationale." He was a person with musical talent and musical accomplishment. At that time, there were already three Chinese translations of "The Internationale," but none of them were well translated and could be sung. There was a harmonium in his room, and after he translated a sentence, he would play and sing it on the harmonium, repeatedly chanting it, so that the lyrics fit the score appropriately. After that, thousands of Chinese working people sang "…Unite and fight tomorrow, The Internationale shall be the human race…"
    After the failure of China's First Revolutionary Civil War, we met again unexpectedly in what was then called the "Red Capital." Every time we met, he would always repeatedly say the same thing with the fiery mouth of a revolutionary agitator: "China needs Soviet literary theory and literary works too much! You should devote yourself to this work, you should complete this work as a solemn revolutionary political task!..."
    Around 1930, after Qu Qiubai returned to China, I regularly sent him books and periodicals from Leningrad. After receiving them, he introduced them whenever he had the opportunity. Among them was Gelatkov's long novel "Cement," and after Qu Qiubai translated it, he wrote a letter saying, "This book has been translated... When it is published, I want to write a preface, and the preface will only have five big characters, which is: 'Not a Utopia!'" Unfortunately, this translation was burned down along with the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Commercial Press in Zhabei when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai. Qu Qiubai's translation of "New Land" was burned down by the great fire of the Japanese invaders, but the "New Land" in Qu Qiubai's ideal, this truly "Not a Utopia" "New Land," and the "New Land" for which he finally sacrificed his most precious life – the brilliant People's Republic of China – has finally appeared under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! No fire of any imperialist robber can burn down this sacred new land of great glory, and on the contrary, as long as these robbers dare to try it, they themselves will be burned! This is the iron law of historical progress, and the fire-jumping American imperialist robbers and their lackeys should remember this vivid historical lesson!
    In an article "Stalin and Literature" in 1931, Qu Qiubai believed that "the literary struggle of the Soviet proletariat, the leading force of the world proletariat, should be our model." He wanted to spread Marxist-Leninist literary theory to the broad masses of China as much as possible. In this regard, the translation, only in the upper volume of "Overseas Forest," is more than 400,000 words.
    Qu Qiubai had a fiery heart, and this heart emitted a raging flame, constantly burning him, causing him to be restless in the tense and dangerous revolutionary battles, using medicine to maintain his illness, extracting gaps in health that were indispensable for rest, to engage in the introduction and promotion of Soviet literature. And his erudition and strong expressive power were also unmatched. In this regard, those who are now engaged in translation and introduction work should earnestly study and learn from his translations and absorb the valuable experience he left behind. Even extremely dry and extremely difficult theoretical articles are delicately, euphemistically, and vividly active on paper through his translation pen. Marxist-Leninist theoretical articles, through his talented and flowery pen, truly took root and blossomed in the hearts of the vast number of Chinese literary readers! This is the pen of a revolutionary agitator, unparalleled in sharpness, fiery, and full of life!
    In terms of works, in addition to the early translations of Russian classical works and the burned long novel "New Land," the lower volume of "Overseas Forest" contains nearly 400,000 words. Among them, in particular, is Gorky's short story collection, using the pseudonym "Xiao Can," published in Shanghai around the end of 1933. As soon as the book was published, it was noticed by the Kuomintang hounds that this was Qu Qiubai's pseudonym, and for this reason, the book was immediately confiscated. This is not surprising. The translator said in the postscript of the book: "Those who are trampled and oppressed are actually not only exploited, but also deceived by lies accumulated over thousands of years. When they cannot see through this deception, they are pushing away freedom and delaying the date of their own liberation. And it is the writer who exposes all the lies of the old society who digs out his own heart and uses its flame to illuminate the road to the new society." Finally, he quoted Gorky's "Unusual Story" as the ending, saying: "The 'role of many books in the world is to drag our thoughts to another aspect... In fact, what is interesting is not what is written in the book, but for what purpose these books are written. I say this is written to comfort us,' Gorky's book is not a book to comfort us, it is a book to awaken us, such a book should 'teach us how to live tomorrow.'" This is enough reason to be confiscated.
    In the upper volume of "Overseas Forest," in addition to Lenin's classic literary theories on Tolstoy, the most complete is Gorky's essay collection. This includes twenty Gorky essays. All of them are very important articles. Qu Qiubai said in "Writing in Front": "Gorky himself said: 'The artist observes the inner world of people—psychology, expressing his greatness and baseness, the power of his intellect and the power of his animality.' Here he clearly states that the artist must first have the ability to distinguish between 'greatness' and 'baseness,' 'intellect' and 'animality.' This is to be distinguished from a certain standpoint—a class standpoint. We must know that for Confucius and Mencius or Huang Lao, for Jesus Christ is great, for example, the virtues of 'gentleness, kindness, courtesy, frugality, and humility' or 'giving people a slap in the face'—may be the baseness of servility for us. What is rational for bourgeois theorists is exactly the selfishness and egoism that is worse than animality for us." He said that Gorky's essays reflect all aspects of the world's great battles. Saying that Gorky here exposes hypocritical humanitarianism and liberalism, whips philistine individualism, incurable egoism, and loudly opposes all exploitation systems, all massacres, tyranny, and wars. He supports the only sacred war in the world—the war to eliminate all exploiting classes. He praises the lofty wisdom of the working people—the leadership and creation of the working class. How profound, kind, and fresh these words seem today! This today more powerfully helps us, under the call of Chairman Mao and the Party, to eliminate the hypocritical humanitarianism, liberalism, and self-interest left by the bourgeoisie, and to build our infinitely bright motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party.
    In December 1931, in an article "The 'Destruction' of Manchuria?" Qu Qiubai said that when the Soviet Union was in the civil war, Eastern Siberia was occupied by Japan and the Russian White Army. The guerrillas of Lai Fensheng, etc., led huge battles, eliminated the Japanese occupation army, repelled the armies of fourteen imperialist countries, and eliminated countless White Army generals. When Qu Qiubai wrote this paper, it was precisely when the Japanese imperialist robbers were ravaging the Northeast, when the French imperialist army was entering Yunnan and Guangxi, especially when the China Division Research Committee of British, American, French, Japanese, and German imperialism was about to come to China to "investigate," what would Chinese readers feel when they read this passionate novel at that time? Qu Qiubai himself answered in the article: "China's 'Lai Fensheng' has been produced, and is still being produced... These hundreds of millions of people are fighting, are transforming, they are going to become new and strong people, they are people who stand upright... What is destroyed is not Manchuria, but all kinds of hunters, all kinds of hounds!"
    At the same time, he said in the conclusion of the article "'Iron Torrent' in Paris": "History is going in that direction, and that form of life will always triumph, what will always be destroyed—'never to recover.' This thing that is about to 'never recover' will desperately fabricate rumors and desperately propagandize on the eve of its own demise. They also try to use the blood of hundreds of millions of people to save the fate that cannot be saved—to maintain their dog lives with the war of imperialist massacres. However, what will answer such rumor propaganda and massacre war will be the 'iron torrent' of the whole world—the hurricane of the iron ocean."
    These are the words that Qu Qiubai said exactly twenty years ago, and how true they seem today! "What is destroyed is not Manchuria, but all kinds of hunters, all kinds of hounds!" Where did the Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism, the "modernized" troops of American imperialism armed for Chiang Kai-shek, and transported to the Northeast on their behalf, go? Not long ago, all kinds of hunters on the Chinese mainland, and all kinds of hounds that these hunters fully supported, were swept away by this irresistible "hurricane of the iron ocean," and not even a ghost shadow could be seen!
    These words of Qu Qiubai are far more than just an enthusiastic promotion of Soviet literature, but a pointed out with the iron-clad, unchanging historical red pen, based on the law of historical progress, "that form of life will always triumph, what will always be destroyed—'never to recover.'"
    However, all moths throughout history have been short-sighted. Although rushing to the lamplight is the destruction of themselves, they always stubbornly rush to the lamplight. The "hurricane of the iron ocean" of the whole world is rising, hunters, hounds—American imperialism and its servants, destined destruction is facing you!
    Finally, let me quote two more sentences from Qu Qiubai to conclude this article: "...Translating famous works of world proletarian revolutionary literature, and systematically introducing them to Chinese readers (especially Soviet famous works, because they can contribute to readers through concrete images, through artistic illumination, to the heroes of the great October, the Civil War, and the Five-Year Plan.)—this is one of the important tasks of Chinese proletarian literary workers." ("On Translation" Qu Qiubai's letter to Mr. Lu Xun).

    瞿秋白同志为介绍苏联文学所进行的斗争
    ——纪念瞿秋白同志殉难十七周年
    曹靖华
    一个无产阶级先锋队里的战士，他必然是一个爱国主义者，同时也必然是一个国际主义者。瞿秋白同志不但是中国人民革命的先驱者和政治领导者之一，而且是一个卓越的革命文学家。他在国民党反动派极端残暴的迫害下，坚贞不屈地用犀利的火热的笔，剥露了国民党反动派的一切卑鄙无耻的欺骗人民的假面具，向人民大众宣传了真理。他在一九三二年三月写的“战争文学”里说：“日本的工人反对日本资产阶级派兵来打中国，而中国的劳动民众和兵士要把日本资产阶级派来的军队打回去。……这是革命的国际主义立场，也就是中国民族解放的唯一道路。”当时国民党反动派正在加紧进行“红白战争”，同时还在帝国主义的支持下，准备向苏联挑衅。那时国民党御用的反动文学，“用一切无耻的卑劣的谣言和咒骂帮着白军的枪炮来攻打民众，攻打工人，攻打已经建设着社会主义的国家。而劳动民众，可积极的反对白军，反对进攻苏联，因为反对白军的战争以及拥护苏联的战争，是劳动民众自己的战争，是为着劳动民众的解放的。革命文学和普罗文学对于战争的态度，自然就是工人阶级领导之下的劳动民众的态度。”
    秋白热情地宣扬苏联文学，介绍苏联文学，这不是一般的无动于衷的、为文艺而文艺的书斋里的工作，而是中国无产阶级先锋队里的坚贞不屈的战士的火热的爱国主义者与国际主义者的庄严的政治斗争的血肉相关的一部分。他的工作的目的，是要中国走上人类最光辉的道路，社会主义、共产主义的道路。
    秋白最初是在北京俄文专修馆读书的。“五四”时代，他就开始从原文介绍俄国老托尔斯泰及果戈理的短篇。他是从原文直接介绍俄国文学作品的最初的几个人中的一个。从原文介绍俄国文学的，这以前恐怕是没有了。
    十月革命后，秋白也是最初到苏维埃俄罗斯去的四个人中的一个。因为他的俄文在国内已经有了基础，所以到了那里，阅读东西，就有很大的便利。可是他的健康是很差的，尤其是有极严重的肺病，当时医生说他有一叶肺已经烂了，说他顶多也不过能支持三几年。但他的心情却非常豪迈，乐观！一个肯定光明的国际主义者，也不能不是豪迈乐观的！当时他不顾一切地奋力工作着。他把苏联比作一座琳琅满目的革命的宝山，他要拚着自己的短促的生命，把那些革命的宝贝，尽量地多多地搬到中国来。有一个时期，他病得不能起床了，他就把电灯拴到床架上，俯到枕上写东西。当时的苏联，被资本主义国家重重封锁起来，并且在世界各国散布些奇离的谣言。苏联的实况，在大多数人的心目中，当时几乎成了“世界之谜”。而秋白就拚命把“共产主义的人间化”（秋白的一篇通讯题目），把苏联的实况、苏维埃的制度等等，透过资本主义所散布的重重的迷雾，告诉给为解放而战斗的中国人民，告诉给全世界的争自由的劳动者。他要在中国劳动人民面前，在全世界劳动人民面前，把帝国主义者的谣言揭穿，把帝国主义者的面具剥掉，叫大家辨清敌我，认清道路，不要上那些吸血鬼的当！
    那时候——一九二一到一九二二年——他除了经常写些报告苏联实况的通讯而外，还写了“新俄游记”和“赤都心史”，他在这里尽情地讴歌了苏维埃的文学、艺术以及社会制度与社会生活。
    一九二三年十月，他在“赤俄新文艺时代的第一燕”一文里曾说：“俄罗斯革命不但开世界政治史的新时代，而且也辟出人类文化的新道路”。他并且认为“真正的文化只是无产阶级的文化”。那时他已经回国，在北京主编“新青年季刊”。同时他还在译“国际歌”。他是有音乐才能与音乐修养的人。“国际歌”在当时已经有三种中译文，然而没有一种译得好，而且能够唱的。他房间里有一架风琴，他译好一句，就在风琴上自弹自唱，反复吟咏，使歌词适如其分的合乎乐谱。这以后，千千万万的中国劳动人民的口中，就唱出了“……团结起来到明天，英特纳雄纳尔就一定要实现……”
    中国第一次国内革命战争失败后，我们又在当年所称的“赤都”不期而遇了。每次见面，他总是以那火热的革命鼓动家的口，滔滔不绝地反复着那同样的话：“苏联的文艺理论与文艺作品，中国太需要了！你应该专力从事这种工作，你应该把这种工作当作庄严的革命的政治任务来完成！……”
    大约是一九三○年吧，秋白回国以后，我从列宁格勒经常给他寄书刊。他收到后，遇机就介绍出来。其中有“士敏土”作者革拉特柯夫的长篇“新地”，秋白译出之后，当时还写信说：“这书已译好……出版时我要写一篇序，这序只有五个大字，就是：‘并非乌托邦！’”不幸这部译稿在日本强盗进攻上海时，随着闸北商务印书馆编译所被烧掉了。秋白的译稿“新地”被日本强盗的大火烧掉了，可是秋白理想中的“新地”，这真正“并非乌托邦”的“新地”，而且为了这他终于献出了自己最宝贵的生命的“新地”——光辉灿烂的中华人民共和国，在中国人民的英明领袖毛主席和共产党的领导下，终于出现了！任何帝国主义强盗的烈火，都烧不掉这光芒万丈的神圣的新地，而且相反的，只要这些强盗胆敢尝试一下的话，那他自身一定要被烧掉的！这是历史进展的铁律，跳火的美帝国主义强盗及其走狗们，应该记取这活生生的历史教训了！
    一九三一年秋白在“斯大林和文学”一文中，认为“世界无产阶级的领导队伍——苏联无产阶级的文学斗争应当是我们的模范。”他要用一切可能，把马列主义的文艺理论，传布到中国广大的群众中间。在这方面的翻译，仅以收在“海上述林”上卷而言，就有四十多万言。
    秋白有一颗火热的心，这心发出熊熊的烈焰，时时在燃烧着他，使他寝不安枕地在紧张、艰险的革命的战斗中，用药养着病，抽出健康上所不可缺的休息的间隙，来从事苏联文学的介绍与宣扬。而他的学识的渊博，表现力之强，也是人所难及的。在这方面，现在从事翻译介绍工作的人，应该切实钻研、学习他的译作，吸取他留下来的宝贵的经验。甚至极枯燥，极艰深的理论文章，透过他的译笔，都细腻、委婉、栩栩如生地活跃纸上。马列主义的理论文章，透过他的天才的、生花的笔，在中国广大文艺读者的心中，真正生根，开花了！这是犀利无比的、火焰般的、生命蓬勃的革命鼓动家的笔呵！
    作品方面，除了早期译的俄国古典作品以及被烧掉的长篇“新地”外，收入“海上述林”下卷的，将近四十万字。其中特别是高尔基的短篇选集，用笔名“萧参”，大约于一九三三年末在上海出版。这书一出版就被国民党猎犬的嗅觉，察出这是秋白的化名，就因为这个原故，立即把该书没收了。这也难怪。译者在该书的后记中说：“被蹂躏，被压迫的人们，其实不但受着剥削，而且还受着千百年来积累起来的谎骗。当他们不能看穿这种谎骗的时候，他们是在推开着自由，是在拖延着自己解放的日期。而正是揭穿旧社会的一切谎骗的作家，他挖出了自己的心，把它的火焰来照耀走到新社会去的道路。”末了，他引高尔基的“不平常的故事”作收尾说：“世界上的许多书的‘作用是要把我们的思想拖到别一方面去……其实有趣的，并不在于书里写的东西，而是在这些书为了什么目的而写的。我说这是为了安慰我们而写的，’高尔基的书却不是安慰我们的书，这是惊醒我们的书，这样的书要‘教会我们明天怎样去生活’。”这也足够作为被没收的理由了。
    “海上述林”上卷里，除了列宁论托尔斯泰等经典性的文艺理论外，最完整的是高尔基论文集。这里包括高尔基论文二十篇。都是非常重要的文章。秋白在“写在前面”中说：“高尔基自己说：‘艺术家观察着人的内心世界——心理，表现他的伟大和卑劣，他的理智的力量和他的兽性的力量。’这里他明白的说出来：艺术家首先要有点儿分辨‘伟大’和‘卑劣’、‘理智’和‘兽性’的能力。这是要从一定的立场——阶级的立场去分辨的。要知道对于孔孟或是黄老，对于耶稣基督是伟大的，例如‘温良恭俭让’或是‘给人打嘴巴’的美德，——对于我们也许是奴性的卑劣。对于资产阶级的理论家是理智的，对于我们恰好是比兽性还要恶劣的私有主义和利己主义。”他说高尔基的论文之中，反映着世界的伟大战斗的各方面。说高尔基在这儿暴露虚伪的人道主义和自由主义，鞭打市侩的个人主义，不可救药的利己主义，大声疾呼地反对一切剥削制度，一切屠杀、暴虐、战争。他赞助这世界上的唯一的神圣的战争——消灭一切剥削阶级的战争。他歌颂劳动人民的崇高的智慧——工人阶级的领导和创造。这些话在今天看来是多么深刻、亲切、新鲜！这在今天更有力地帮助我们在毛主席和党的号召下，扫除资产阶级留下的虚伪的人道主义、自由主义、损人利己等等腐朽思想，在毛主席和党的领导下，来建设我们无限光明的祖国。
    一九三一年十二月，秋白在“满洲的‘毁灭’？”一文中，谈及法捷耶夫的“毁灭”时说，苏联当国内战争的时候，东西伯利亚被日本及俄国白党军队占领着，莱奋生等的游击队，领导着巨大的战斗，消灭了日本占领军，击退了十四个帝国主义国家的军队，消灭了数不清的白党将军。秋白写这篇论文的时候，正是日本帝国主义强盗蹂躏着东北的时候，正是法帝国主义军队开进云南广西的时候，尤其是正当英美法日德帝国主义的瓜分中国研究委员会将要来到中国“调查”的时候，当时中国的读者读了这部充满热血的小说，当有什么样的感想呢？秋白自己在该文中回答道：“中国的‘莱奋生’已经产生，还在产生着……这几万万人是在战斗着，是在改造着，他们要成为新的坚强的人，他们是顶天立地的人……毁灭的可并不是满洲，而是一切种种的猎人，一切种种的猎狗！”
    同时，他在“‘铁流’在巴黎”一文的结语中说：“历史往那一方面走着，那一种形式的生活始终要胜利的，什么是始终要毁灭的——‘万劫不复’的。这种将要‘万劫不复’的东西，在自己灭亡的前夜，才要拚命的造谣，拚命的宣传。他们还企图用几万万几十万万人的血，去挽回那挽回不了的命运，——用帝国主义大屠杀的战争，来维持自己的狗命。可是，回答这样造谣宣传和屠杀战争的，将要是全世界的‘铁流’，——铁洋的飓风。”
    这是整整二十年前秋白所说的话，在目前看来，是如何的应验！“毁灭的可并不是满洲，而是一切种种的猎人，一切种种的猎狗！”日本帝国主义的关东军，美帝国主义替蒋匪武装的，而且代为抢运到东北的“现代化”部队，都到那儿去了？不久之前，中国大陆上一切种种的猎人，以及这些猎人所全力支持的一切种种的猎狗，都被这不可抗拒的“铁洋的飓风”卷去得连鬼影子也不见了！
    秋白的这些话，已经远不只是热情地对苏联文学的宣扬，而是用铁定不易的历史的火红的笔，本着历史进展的规律，指出了“那一种形式的生活始终要胜利的，什么是始终要毁灭的——‘万劫不复’的。”
    然而历来的所有的扑灯蛾，一概都是短视，虽然扑到灯火上是自身的毁灭，然而总是一意孤行地往灯火上扑。全世界的“铁洋的飓风”正在卷起了，猎人，猎狗——美帝国主义及其仆从们，命定的毁灭正在迎着你们！
    末了，让我再引秋白的两句话，作本文的结束吧：“……翻译世界无产阶级革命文学的名著，并且有系统的介绍给中国读者，（尤其是苏联的名著，因为它们能够对于伟大的十月，国内战争，五年计划的英雄，经过具体的形象，经过艺术的照耀，而贡献给读者。）——这是中国普罗文学者的重要任务之一。”（“论翻译”秋白致鲁迅先生信）。
