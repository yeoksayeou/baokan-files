Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th. General Nan Ri, our chief representative, sent a letter to Major General Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. side, on the 5th, demanding that the U.S. side provide a clear explanation without further delay regarding the whereabouts of 1,014 of our captured personnel, which the U.S. side had promised to explain but has not yet done so. The vast majority of these unaccounted-for captured personnel were not included in the prisoner-of-war materials handed over by the U.S. side in December of last year, but later had handwritten letters delivered to our side by the U.S. side; others were originally listed in the list handed over by the U.S. side on December 18, but were not included in the list submitted by the U.S. side on January 28; and some appeared repeatedly in the list of prisoners of war handed over by the U.S. side. In his letter to Harrison, General Nan Ri agreed to reply to the U.S. side's request on the 4th to provide a list of 91 U.S. prisoners of war "after inquiry."

    As everyone knows, the U.S. side has never clearly accounted for the number of prisoners of war they have detained in the issue of POW repatriation. When the U.S. side handed over to our side the list of our captured personnel on December 18 of last year, they announced that there were a total of 133,930 of our captured personnel under their detention. However, the names actually listed were only 132,474, which is 1,456 less than the total number of prisoners of war claimed by the U.S. side at the same time. Compared with the list of prisoners of war transferred to us by the U.S. side through the International Committee of the Red Cross, the difference is as large as more than 44,200 people.

    The U.S. side has consistently failed to clearly account for the number of prisoners of war, and now, disregarding the public indignation of the world's righteous people, is increasingly brutally massacring our captured personnel in its prisoner-of-war camps. Its vicious intention is to prevent the Korean armistice, expand the Korean War, and disregard the just demands of prisoners of both sides who long to return home and live peaceful lives as soon as possible.

### 美方对于战俘数字  一向没有交代清楚  显系有意阻挠谈判无视战俘要求

    美方对于战俘数字
    一向没有交代清楚
    显系有意阻挠谈判无视战俘要求
    【新华社开城六日电】五日我方首席代表南日将军致函美方首席代表哈利逊少将，要求美方对曾经答应交代，而至今仍未交代的我方被俘人员一千零十四人的下落，交代清楚，不再迟延。这些尚未交代的我方被俘人员，其中绝大多数是在美方去年十二月间交出的战俘材料中未曾列入，而事后尚有亲笔信件由美方交给我方者；其余有的是原列入十二月十八日美方交来的名单中，而在美方一月二十八日所交的名单中却未列入的；有的是在美方交来的战俘名单中重复出现者。南日将军在致哈利逊函内，对美方四日要求我方交代九十一名美方战俘名单，答应他在“查询后予以答复”。
    众所周知，美方在战俘遣返问题上，从未将他们收容的战俘数字交代清楚。美方在去年十二月十八日交给我方关于我方被俘人员名单时，曾宣布在其收容下的我方被俘人员共十三万三千九百三十名。但名单中实际列出的姓名却只有十三万二千四百七十四名，较之美方同时所声称的战俘总数就少了一千四百五十六名。这数目和美方经由红十字国际委员会转交我方的战俘名单相比较，竟相差四万四千二百多人。
    美方一贯对战俘数字不予交代清楚，而现在又不顾世界正义人民的公愤，愈来愈凶恶地在其战俘营中屠杀我方被俘人员，其恶毒的用意，就是阻止朝鲜停战，扩大朝鲜战争，无视双方战俘渴望早日回家，过和平生活的正义要求。
