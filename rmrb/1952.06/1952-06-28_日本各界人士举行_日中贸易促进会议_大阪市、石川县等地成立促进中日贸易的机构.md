Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Tokyo delayed news: Under the initiative of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Tokyo held a "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" on May 22nd. Participants in this conference included Japanese politicians, figures from industry and trade, representatives from labor unions, farmers, cultural groups, news organizations, and members of the Diet, totaling approximately 180 people. The enthusiastic atmosphere of the conference reflected the widespread and urgent hope among people from all walks of life in Japan for the restoration of trade relations between Japan and China.

The conference elected former Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kumaichi Yamamoto, and Director of the China Research Institute, Yoshitaro Hirano, as chairmen of the presidium. Kumaichi Yamamoto delivered a speech, stating:

"Reopening Japan-China trade is opening a path for Japan's survival." Subsequently, Yoshitaro Hirano reported on the great achievements of the Moscow International Economic Conference. He pointed out: The great achievements of the Moscow International Economic Conference illustrate one fact: What the government cannot do, the people can do. If Japan's economic crisis is broken through by the strength of the Japanese people, it can be broken through. He also said: If Japan cannot trade with China for a long time, Japan will be forever rejected by this huge market.

Many Japanese industrialists who attended the meeting spoke. They unanimously advocated that Japan should trade with New China. Hideo Sakurai, director of the "Ba" Trading Company, said: "The Japanese people and the Diet must unite and launch a movement to promote trade. The Yoshida government's trade control orders hinder Japan-China trade and must be abolished." Minoru Shiramizu, manager of the Tokyo branch of "Toho Trading Company," used his company's experience in trading with China to explain: "People can trade with confidence." Junzo Matsuda, general manager of Shinano Chemical Company, said: The Japanese people are enthusiastically hoping to conduct Japan-China trade. "Realizing Japan-China trade is a major event. We must launch a national movement with the greatest determination. It is political forces that are hindering trade, and trade cannot be realized without fighting against these political forces." He advocated: "Anyone who opposes Japan-China trade must not be allowed to be elected in the next general election."

Tetsutaro Otani of the National Federation of Industrial Unions said that labor unions in various industries have successively established symposiums to promote trade with China, and hope that factories can also vigorously promote this movement.

The conference finally passed the following resolutions: send letters to Takayoshi Kora, Kisuke Miyakoshi, and Kei Hoashi, encouraging them to restore Japan-China trade; request Diet members to submit a resolution to the Diet to promote Japan-China trade; request government authorities to open up Japan-China trade; and establish the "Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference" as a permanent organization to launch a national movement to promote Japan-China trade.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Tokyo News: Economic figures in various parts of Japan are eagerly looking forward to trading with New China, and they have successively organized institutions to promote Japan-China trade.

Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in Osaka held a symposium on promoting Japan-China trade on the 12th, resolving to request the Japanese Diet and government to do their best to restore Japan-China trade. The meeting also decided to establish the Kansai (Kyoto-Osaka western area) Japan-China Trade Promotion Association as soon as possible, and elected Keizo Fujita (transliteration) and other ten people as preparatory committee members.

Ishikawa Prefecture is launching a campaign to promote trade between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. "Ishikawa Seisakusho," "Tsudakoma," "Hokuriku Kikai" and other companies in the prefecture are preparing to export goods to China at any time. At the same time, the union conference of eight companies including "Ishikawa Seisakusho" has decided to launch a signature campaign to promote Japan-China trade, and members of these unions have already started signing. The local Japan-China Friendship Association is also launching a signature campaign.

The Ogaki City in Gifu Prefecture has established an Ogaki Preparatory Committee for the China-Japan Trade Promotion Association to study the actual situation of trade centered on China and prepare to carry out work. Many businessmen in Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture, are brewing to establish a cooperative trading company throughout the Sanin region (the northern part of the southern end of Honshu Island) to directly trade with New China.

In addition, economic figures in Otaru City, Hokkaido, held a China-Soviet Trade Symposium on May 10th to discuss matters related to Japan's trade with China and the Soviet Union. Mayor of Otaru City, Adachi, Professor Kiso of Otaru University of Commerce, Chairman of Otaru Labor Union Conference, Shimamoto, and others also attended the meeting. They were quite excited about the possibility of resuming trade with China and the Soviet Union as mentioned by Kazuo Suzuki of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association at the meeting.

    日本各界人士举行“日中贸易促进会议”
    大阪市、石川县等地成立促进中日贸易的机构
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京迟到消息：在日中友好协会的发起下，东京在五月二十二日举行了“日中贸易促进会议”。参加这个会议的有日本的政治家、产业界和贸易界人士，工会、农民和文化团体、新闻机关的代表和国会议员等共约一百八十人。会议的热烈情况，反映出日本各阶层人民普遍要求日本与中国恢复贸易关系的迫切希望。
    大会推选前外务省次官山本熊一和中国研究所所长平野义太郎为主席团。山本熊一首先致词说：
    “重新开放日中贸易，就是打开日本的生存的途径。”接着，平野义太郎在会上报告了莫斯科国际经济会议的伟大成就。他指出：莫斯科国际经济会议的伟大成就说明了一件事实：政府不能干的，人民都能干。日本的经济危机，要是用日本民间的力量去予以打破，就能够打破。他并说：日本如果长此不能与中国进行贸易，日本将永远被这个巨大的市场所摈弃。
    许多到会的日本实业家都讲了话。他们一致主张日本应与新中国进行贸易。“巴”贸易公司董事樱井秀男说：日本“国民和国会一定要打成一片，展开促进贸易的运动。吉田政府的贸易管理令阻挠日中贸易，必须撤销。”“东邦商会”东京分公司经理白水实以该公司与中国进行贸易的经验说明：“人们可以放心交易。”信浓化学公司总经理松田顺三说：日本国民都热烈希望进行日中贸易。“实现日中贸易是一件大事。必须用最大的决心展开国民运动。阻挠贸易的是政治势力，不与这个政治势力进行斗争是不能实现贸易的。”他主张：“凡是反对日中贸易的，必须不使他在下期大选中当选。”
    全国产业别工会联合会的大谷彻太郎说：目前不同行业的工会纷纷成立了促进与中国贸易的座谈会，希望厂方也能大力推进这个运动。
    大会最后通过如下决议：致函高良富、宫腰喜助和帆足计三人，鼓励他们恢复日中贸易；要求国会议员向国会提出促进日中贸易决议案；要求政府当局开放日中贸易；以“日中贸易促进会议”为常设机关，展开促进日中贸易的国民运动。
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：日本各地经济界人士热烈盼望与新中国进行贸易，他们纷纷组织了促进日中贸易的机构。
    大阪市的中小企业家在十二日召开了一个关于促进日中贸易的座谈会，决议要求日本国会和政府竭尽全力恢复日中贸易。会议又决定早日成立关西
    （京都—大阪以西地区）日中贸易促进会，并推举藤田敬三（译音）等十人为筹备委员。
    石川县全县正在展开促进日本与中苏两国贸易的运动。该县的“石川制作所”、“津田驹”、“北陆机械”等公司都在准备随时向中国输出商品。同时，“石川制作所”等八家公司的工会会议已决定展开一个促进日中贸易的签名运动，这些工会的会员已经开始在签名了。该地日中友好协会也在发动签名运动。
    岐阜县大垣市已经成立了一个中日贸易促进会大垣筹备会，研究以中国为中心的贸易的实际情况，准备开展工作。岛根县松江市的许多商人在酝酿成立整个山阴地方（本州岛南端北部地带）的合作性质的贸易公司，直接与新中国进行贸易。
    此外，北海道小樽市经济界人士等在五月十日举行了中苏贸易座谈会，讨论有关日本与中苏两国进行贸易的事情。小樽市市长安达、小樽商科大学教授木曾、小樽工会会议主席岛本等也出席会议。他们对于中日贸易促进会的铃木一雄在会上所说的可能恢复与中苏两国的贸易一事，颇感兴奋。
