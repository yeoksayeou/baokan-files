    Beijing Holds Advanced Producer Symposium
    Consensus Reached on the Need to Value and Encourage Workers' Nascent Creativity

    In order to encourage cadres and the broad masses of workers to value and promote advanced production experience in the increased production and economy drive, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions successively convened three advanced producer symposiums on the 6th, 11th, and 18th of this month. Participants included advanced producers from major state-owned and public factories and mines across the city, organizers from the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, trade union workers, factory administrative personnel, and technical personnel.

    At the three meetings, advanced producers introduced advanced production experiences in the mechanical sand casting industry and light industry, and everyone discussed issues related to valuing and promoting advanced production experience.

    At the three meetings, everyone unanimously agreed that valuing and promoting advanced production experience is the fundamental method for carrying out the increased production and economy campaign. Since a certain automobile repair factory promoted the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, workers throughout the factory have widely applied the principles of this method to their work. Fitters created a multi-needle scribing method, forgers created a multi-station forging method, and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods also began to be used on planers, thereby generally increasing the output of all workshops by a factor of two. After the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory's Branch No. 1 promoted the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, its output increased significantly. In December 1951, the factory produced only 6,400 sprayers, but in May of this year, it increased to more than 13,000. At the same time, after the promotion of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, the workers' skills improved rapidly. Jin Zhaoying, a female worker with only one year and ten months of work experience, after implementing the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, diligently studied the technology and continuously developed a set of methods for performing the main actions of clamping, feeding, picking buttons, and dropping workpieces simultaneously and rhythmically with both hands, increasing her daily output of the sprayer part "pressure nut" from 360 to 750. As a result, she has been promoted from an apprentice to a level-two technician. After the casting workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory implemented the advanced method of a three-shift system for cast iron, the specialization of labor gave workers the opportunity to further improve their operating methods. With the diligent study of workers such as Fu Zhen'an, a split-box molding method was created, increasing work efficiency by 90 to 100 percent and saving more than 30,000 work hours per year.

    At the same time, everyone believed that after the "Three-Anti" campaign, the workers' political awareness greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for production was generally brought into play, which is a powerful foundation for promoting advanced experience and carrying out the rationalization movement. The achievements of several factories in partially carrying out the rationalization movement in April and May fully demonstrate this point. When a certain automobile repair factory launched a rationalization movement in April and May, workers submitted 1,481 rationalization proposals in just a few days, of which 978 were related to improving production technology. In May, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory launched a campaign to find "tricks of the trade," and every department in the factory participated. Even the accounting office, which had always been a "dead corner" in previous production competitions, tried to improve the method of calculating costs. The factory's employees found more than 70 "tricks of the trade" of various sizes, and 31 have already been successfully tested. According to the factory's annual tasks, these tricks of the trade can increase the value of production by about 450,000 catties of millet for the country after they are implemented.

    However, valuing and promoting advanced production experience is a serious struggle between old and new ideas in state-owned and public enterprises. Therefore, everyone at the meeting believed that whether the leaders of each factory and mine value and support the nascent creativity of the workers is the key to doing a good job in promoting advanced production experience. When the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory's Branch No. 1 promoted Jin Zhaoying's operating method, some workers were unconvinced and said, "I knew this 20 years ago." Some workers mocked her, saying that it was false that she wasn't tired. After the factory leaders learned about this, they encouraged Jin Zhaoying not to be discouraged and convened a symposium where Jin Zhaoying performed on the spot to educate and persuade the workers, enabling Jin Zhaoying's operating method to be widely promoted and the factory's overall work efficiency to increase by 30 percent.

    Because the meeting focused on studying the main problems in current production, everyone who participated believed that such a meeting was very helpful in promoting the current increased production and economy drive and hoped that the city's grassroots trade unions would frequently convene such meetings in various forms. At the same time, everyone also believed that they have now found the trick to doing a good job in factory administrative management and employee education, which is to summarize and promote advanced experience and working methods in this area in a guided and planned manner. To this end, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions plans to convene a symposium for advanced workers in factory management departments and invite members of factory rationalization proposal committees to meet in the near future to specifically study how to widely summarize and promote advanced production experience and working methods in all aspects of industrial production, so as to comprehensively and healthily carry out the patriotic increased production and economy movement.

    北京市召开先进生产者座谈会
    一致认为必须重视和鼓励工人群众的萌芽性的创造
    为了使干部和广大职工群众在增产节约竞赛中重视和推广先进生产经验，北京市总工会于本月六日、十一日和十八日连续召开三次先进生产者座谈会。参加会议的有全市国营、公营各大厂矿先进生产者、共产党和青年团的组织者、工会工作人员、工厂行政管理人员和技术人员。
    在三次会议上，由先进生产者介绍了机械翻砂工业和轻工业中的先进生产经验，大家漫谈了重视和推广先进生产经验有关的问题。
    三次会议上，大家一致认为重视和推广先进生产经验，是开展增产节约竞赛运动的基本方法。某汽车修配厂自推广多刀多刃切削法后，全厂工人广泛地把多刀多刃切削法的原理应用到自己工作中，钳工创造了多针划线法，锻工创造了多台锻工法，刨床上也开始使用多刀多刃切削法；因而使全厂各车间产量普遍提高一倍。华北农业机械总厂第一分厂在推广多刀多刃切削法后产量显著增加，该厂在一九五一年十二月生产喷雾器仅六千四百架，今年五月份即提高到一万三千多架；同时在推广多刀多刃切削法后，工人的技术得到飞速提高，仅有一年零十个月工龄的女工金兆瑛，在实行多刀多刃切削法后，由于她钻研技术，在卡活、进刀挑扣和落活等主要动作上，连续摸出一套两手同时有规律地进行操作的方法，使制造喷雾器零件“压母”的日产量，由三百六十个提高到七百五十个；因而她已由徒工被提为二级技术工人。华北农业机械总厂铸工车间，在推行铸铁三班制的先进方法后，由于分工专一，工人有机会进一步改进操作方法；在工人富振安等钻研下，创造了分箱造型法，工作效率提高了百分之九十到一百，每年可以节省三万多工时。
    同时大家认为，在“三反”以后，工人们的政治觉悟大大提高，生产积极性也普遍得到发挥，这是推广先进经验，开展合理化运动的有力基础。从几个厂在四、五月份内部分开展合理化运动的成绩看来，充分证明这一点。某汽车修配厂在四、五月份开展合理化运动时，短短几天内，工人即提出一千四百八十一条合理化建议，其中属于改进生产技术的有九百七十八件。华北农业机械总厂，在五月份开展找“窍门”运动，全厂每一个部门都参加了，历次生产竞赛中一直都是“死角”的会计室，也想法改进计算成本方法；全厂职工找出七十多个大小“窍门”，已试验成功的有三十一个。按该厂全年任务计算，这些窍门推行后，可为国家增产价值约四十五万斤小米财富。
    但重视和推广先进生产经验，是国营、公营企业中一个严重的新旧思想之间斗争。因此大家在会议上都认为，各个厂矿领导上是不是重视和扶持工人群众中萌芽性的创造，是做好推广先进生产经验工作的关键。华北农业机械总厂第一分厂，在推广金兆瑛的操作方法时，有些工人不服气地说：“二十年前我就会了。”有的工人嘲讽她，说她不累是假的。该厂的领导上知道后，一方面鼓励金兆瑛不要气馁，一方面召开座谈会，由金兆瑛当场表演，以此来教育和说服工人，而使金兆瑛操作方法得以普遍推广，使全厂工作效率普遍提高百分之三十。
    由于会议抓住当前生产中主要问题研究，参加会议的每个人都认为这样的会议对推动当前增产节约竞赛很有帮助，希望全市各基层工会经常利用各种不同形式召开这样会议。同时大家也认为，如何做好工厂行政管理工作和职工群众教育工作，现在也找到了窍门，这就是有领导地有计划地总结和推广这方面的先进经验和工作方法。为此，北京市总工会准备在最近召开工厂管理部门先进工作者座谈会和各厂合理化建议委员来开会，专门研究如何广泛地总结和推广工业生产中各个方面的先进生产经验和工作方法，以便使得爱国增产节约运动全面地、健康地开展起来。（新华社）
