    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Stalin City on the Danube
    On the banks of the Danube River in southern Hungary, in and around the site of a formerly remote and backward town called Dunapentele, the Hungarian people are enthusiastically building a new socialist industrial city. To thank the Soviet Union for its assistance to Hungary and to express their love for Comrade Stalin, more than 14,000 construction workers and all the residents proposed to their beloved leader, Comrade Rákosi, before the October Revolution anniversary last year, that this emerging city be named after the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin. Therefore, the original Dunapentele was renamed Sztálinváros – Stalin City – from that time on.
    The construction of Stalin City is a major event in the lives of the Hungarian people. The Stalin City United Iron and Steel Works is the largest factory in Hungary's Five-Year Plan, and the funds spent on building this factory account for about one-tenth of the total industrial investment in the Five-Year Plan. Stalin City will have a series of factories ranging from smelting ore to manufacturing rolled metal, as well as a large power station, a chemical plant, a brick factory, a wide and modern ice-free inland river port, a railway line dozens of kilometers long, and elevated railways to shorten the transportation line from the port to the factory, and so on.
    When the first part of the Stalin Iron and Steel Works goes into operation in 1954, its output of pig iron will be more than one-third greater than the total amount of pig iron produced by all metallurgical factories in Hungary in 1949. Therefore, it plays a very important role in Hungary's economic construction.
    The huge scale of the Stalin City construction project can also be seen from the following figures: a thousand engineers spent eight months designing the blueprints for the entire project, and these blueprints, when put together, are as thick as eight volumes of encyclopedia; the volume of the workshops and factory buildings of the Stalin Iron and Steel Works will be equal to three million cubic meters; six hundred thousand cubic meters of river sand were used in the construction project in the first half of 1951 alone; and forty-one million bricks will be used for building houses this year.
    The construction of such a huge industrial city requires tens of thousands of skilled workers, engineers, and technicians. This is certainly a considerable difficulty, but this great project has inspired the patriotism of the Hungarian people. Countless workers, staff members, and farmers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government, and have come from all over the country to actively participate in the construction work. Hundreds of thousands of young students have also used their vacations to come here to help with the work.
    The Soviet people's fraternal assistance in building Hungary's Stalin City plays an important role. Many of the modern machines working on the construction site, such as tractors, excavators, surveying instruments, and cranes, were shipped from the Soviet Union. Using Soviet machinery alone, five million cubic meters of soil can be excavated on this construction site – equivalent to more than two-thirds of the total amount of soil excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal. In terms of technology, Soviet experts have also provided selfless assistance. Famous Soviet Stakhanovite workers, such as high-speed bricklayer Maksimenko, and Ural's famous welder Amosov, have personally come to the construction site to introduce their excellent working methods to their Hungarian brothers, enabling them to improve their operating methods and increase their work efficiency.
    Now, the prototype of Stalin City has gradually emerged. Rows of two- and three-story houses and apartments are growing next to green saplings. The white building of the Palace of Culture and the neon lights of the "Peace" Hotel are attracting people. Buses are running on the brand-new, flat streets. Many fir trees and hundreds of thousands of flowering plants have been planted in the park. The railway station has been opened, and the docks on the Danube River have also been completed. In addition, an open-air cinema with two thousand seats, a stadium that can accommodate nearly ten thousand people, and schools, hospitals, clubs, etc., have also been completed. The population here has exceeded 35,000.
    The construction of Stalin City is a sign of the Hungarian people's victory on the road to socialism and a vivid manifestation of their will to defend peace. The Hungarian people excitedly say: "Stalin City and its iron and steel works are a fortress in the vast land of the peaceful democratic countries from the Yangtze River to the Danube River."

### 多瑙河畔的斯大林城

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    多瑙河畔的斯大林城
    在匈牙利南部多瑙河畔一个从前十分偏僻、落后的小镇多瑙本特里的原址及其附近，匈牙利人民正在热情地建设一个新的社会主义的工业城市。为了感谢苏联对匈牙利的帮助和表示对斯大林同志的热爱，当地的一万四千多名建设工人和全部居民，在去年十月革命节前夕向他们敬爱的领袖拉科西同志提出了一个建议，要求以伟大和平旗手斯大林同志的名字来命名这个新兴的城市。因此原来的多瑙本特里就从那时起改名为斯大林瓦若斯——斯大林城。
    建设斯大林城是匈牙利人民生活中的重大事件。斯大林城的联合冶炼厂是匈牙利五年计划中的最大的工厂，为建设这个工厂而花的资金约为五年计划工业总投资的十分之一。斯大林城将拥有由冶炼矿砂起直到制成辗金属为止的一系列的工厂和一个大发电站、一个化学工厂、一个砖瓦厂、一个宽阔的现代化的内河不冻港，同时还要有一条长达数十公里的铁路交通线，以及为缩短由港口到工厂运输线而建设的高架铁路等等。
    斯大林冶炼厂的第一部分在一九五四年开工的时候，它所出产的生铁，将比匈牙利全国冶金工厂在一九四九年所出产的生铁总量多出三分之一以上。因此它对匈牙利的经济建设有着十分重要的作用。
    斯大林城建设工程的巨大规模，也可以从下面的数字看出来：一千个工程师用了八个月的时间来设计整个工程的图样，这些蓝图加在一起，等于八卷百科全书那么厚；斯大林冶炼厂的车间与厂房的体积将等于三百万立方公尺；仅仅在一九五一年上半年的建设工程中就用去了六十万立方公尺的河沙；今年为了建筑房屋将用去四千一百万块砖。
    建设这样一个巨大的工业城市，需要成千成万的熟练工人、工程师和技术人员。这当然是一个不小的困难，但是，这个伟大的工程激发了匈牙利人民的爱国主义精神，无数的工人、职员、农民热烈地响应了党和政府的号召，从全国各地前来积极参加建设工作。成千成百的青年学生也利用他们的假期来到这里帮助工作。
    苏联人民对于建设匈牙利斯大林城的兄弟般帮助，有着重要的作用。在建筑现场上工作着的拖拉机、挖掘机、测量器和起重机等现代化机器，有许多都是从苏联运来的。光是用苏联的机器，就可以在这块建筑基地上挖掘五百万立方公尺的泥土——等于开凿巴拿马运河时所挖掘的泥土总量的三分之二以上。在技术上，苏联的专家们也作了无私的帮助。苏联著名的斯塔哈诺夫工作者、高速砌砖工人马克沁明柯，乌拉尔的著名焊工阿莫索夫等都亲自来到工地，把他们优秀的工作方法介绍给匈牙利的兄弟们，使他们改进操作方法，提高工作效率。
    现在，斯大林城的雏形已经逐渐地显现出来了。一列列二、三层楼的住宅和公寓的旁边，生长着绿色的树苗，文化宫的白色大楼与“和平”大旅馆上的霓虹灯在吸引着人们，公共汽车在崭新的平坦的街道上奔驰着，公园里已栽上了许多枞树和数十万枝花卉植物，火车站已经开放，多瑙河畔的码头也已建筑完成。还有，拥有二千个座位的露天电影院、可以容纳近万人的运动场和学校、医院、俱乐部等也都已建造完成。这里的居民已经超过了三万五千人。
    斯大林城的建设是匈牙利人民走向社会主义的胜利的标志，也是他们保卫和平意志的生动的表现，匈牙利人民兴奋地这样说：“斯大林城和它的冶炼厂，是从扬子江到多瑙河畔的和平民主国家的广大的土地上的一个堡垒。”
