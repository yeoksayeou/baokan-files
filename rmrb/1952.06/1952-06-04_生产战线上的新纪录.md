	New Records on the Production Front

	Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot Sets New Over-Axle Record

	The Shijiazhuang Railway Sub-bureau has continuously set new over-axle records in the full-load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement. The "3005" locomotive of the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, on May 22nd, hauled 3,720 tons of goods, exceeding the axle load by 2,120 tons, setting the highest record for the Tianjin Railway Administration. The main reason this locomotive was able to exceed the axle load was because the driver, Xue Jinzhuang, diligently studied the advanced experience of exceeding axle loads.

	A Locomotive at Hengyang Locomotive Depot Travels 500 Kilometers Daily for 31 Days

	The "635" locomotive of the Hengyang Locomotive Depot of the Hengyang Railway Administration safely traveled 15,664 kilometers from April 7th to May 7th. This means that this locomotive traveled more than 500 kilometers every day for 31 days. This is a new record never before seen in the Hengyang Railway Administration. In the past, some people said: "The Hengyang Railway Administration was established relatively late, and it does not yet have the conditions to run 500 kilometers." But the fact that the "635" locomotive ran 500 kilometers powerfully criticized this conservative thinking.

	Three Locomotive Teams of Nankou Locomotive Depot Safely Exceed Axle Load on Steep Slopes

	The Nankou Locomotive Depot has always been known as a perilous section of the railway, and the employees of this locomotive depot have always considered the "Guan Gou Section" a special area. After this "Three-Anti" campaign, the enthusiasm of the employees was greatly increased. On May 12th, 13th, and 14th, the three locomotive teams of 冖丂1-1595, 冖丂1-1947, and 冖丂434 operated between Kangzhuang and Nankou. Thanks to the close cooperation of various stations, they safely pulled over 11,500 ton-kilometers on this steep slope with cliffs and a gradient of 33.3 per thousand. This brilliant achievement shattered the conservative thinking of some employees who believed that "it is impossible to exceed axle loads in the Guan Gou Section, and exceeding axle loads will inevitably lead to accidents."

	Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot Achieves Average of 500 Kilometers Traveled Per Locomotive

	Drivers at the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot earnestly studied advanced Soviet experience and universally mastered the operating method of opening the throttle wide and raising the handle high. In April of this year, the average daily kilometers per locomotive in the entire depot reached 558 kilometers, and the over-axle traction reached more than 4.853 million ton-kilometers. Because of these important achievements, this depot was awarded the national locomotive depot winning rotating red flag by the Railway Ministry of the Central People's Government in April.

	Guotai Steamboat Crew Sets New National Record for Tonnage Hauled Per Horsepower

	After the "Three-Anti" movement, all the crew members of the Guotai steamboat of the Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau broke with the past mentality of looking out only for themselves and cooperated with each other. They confidently accepted the task of towing five iron barges, carrying 3,145 tons of cargo (with an average tonnage hauled per horsepower reaching 8.06 tons). On May 10th, the Guotai steamboat departed from Nanjing. Before departure, they studied the experience of Soviet tug-barge formations, placing two sharp-nosed barges with shallow drafts and easy wave-breaking abilities in the front and three blunt-nosed barges with deeper drafts in the back to reduce water resistance. Along the way, the drivers and river pilots worked calmly. The workers in the engine room diligently added oil and checked the machinery, ensuring that the propeller turned at 135 revolutions per minute, setting a new national record for tonnage hauled per horsepower.

	Li Wenke and Wu Puzhong of Shanxi Pottery General Factory Reduce Coal Consumption for Firing Bricks Again

	Labor model workers Li Wenke and Wu Puzhong of the Third Branch Factory of the Shanxi Provincial State-run Pottery General Factory have once again created a new record for reducing coal consumption for firing bricks. In 1951, Li Wenke and Wu Puzhong created a new record for reducing coal consumption for firing bricks, increasing the nation's wealth by more than 100,000 jin of millet throughout the year. From May 7th to 25th this year, Li Wenke and Wu Puzhong fired more than 230,000 blue bricks, using only 10 liang and 6 qian of coal per brick, which is 1 liang and 4 qian less coal consumption per brick than last year. The product quality has also improved by 0.2 compared to last year. Li Wenke and Wu Puzhong both said: In the future, we must use our brains more, study production, and strive for a third reduction in coal consumption for firing bricks to create more wealth for the motherland.

    生产战线上的新纪录
    石家庄机务段创超轴新纪录
    石家庄铁路分局在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，连续创造了超轴的新纪录。石家庄机务段“三○○五号”机车，在五月二十二日，牵引了三千七百二十吨货物，超轴二千一百二十吨，创造了天津铁路管理局的最高纪录。这台机车所以能超轴，主要是因为司机薛金庄认真学习了超轴的先进经验。

    衡阳机务段一台机车在三十一天内每天行驶五百公里
    衡阳铁路管理局衡阳机务段“六三五号”机车，从四月七日到五月七日，安全走行了一万五千六百六十四公里。这就是说，这台机车在三十一天内，每天都走行了五百多公里。这是衡阳铁路管理局从来没有过的新纪录。过去有人说：“衡阳铁路管理局成立较晚，跑五百公里还没有条件。”但“六三五号”机车跑五百公里的事实，有力地批判了这种保守思想。             （衡阳机务段通讯组）
    南口机务段三台机车包乘组在大坡道上安全超轴
    南口机务段一向被称为铁路天险段，这个机务段的职工一向也认为“关沟段”是一个特殊地带。经过这次“三反”斗争，职工的积极性大大提高。在五月十二、十三、十四日三天中，冖丂1一五九五、冖丂1一九四七、冖丂4三四号三台机车包乘组，在康庄和南口之间运行。由于各站密切配合，在这山崖陡壁、千分之三十三点三的大坡道上，他们安全超轴牵引一万一千五百多吨公里。这一辉煌的成绩，打破了某些职工的“关沟段没法超轴，一超轴准出事故”的保守思想。

    山海关机务段全段机车平均行驶五百公里
    山海关机务段司机认真学习苏联先进经验，普遍地掌握了大开汽门高提手把的操纵方法，在今年四月，全段日车公里达到五百五十八公里，超轴牵引达到四百八十五万三千多吨公里。因为有这些重要成绩，这个段获得了四月份中央人民政府铁道部全国机务段优胜循环红旗。            （方明）
    国泰轮船员创每马力拖带量全国新纪录
    长江航务局上海分局国泰轮全体船员，在“三反”运动以后，打破了过去自顾自的思想，大家团结合作。他们充满信心地接受了拖带五艘铁驳，载货三千一百四十五吨的任务（平均每匹马力的拖带量达到八点零六吨）。五月十日，国泰轮从南京出发了。出发前，他们学习苏联轮驳编队的经验，把吃水浅易破浪的两艘尖头驳子放在前面，把三艘吃水较深的笨头驳子放在后面，以减少船水的阻力。一路上，驾驶员、领江员都沉着地进行工作。机舱部工人勤加油、勤检查，实现了推进机每分钟转一百三十五转的保证，创造了每马力拖带量的全国新纪录。                         （郑容基）
    山西窑业总厂李文科、吴濮中再次降低烧砖煤耗量
    山西省营窑业总厂第三分厂劳动模范李文科、吴濮中，又一次创造了降低烧砖煤耗新纪录。李文科、吴濮中在一九五一年创造了降低烧砖煤耗新纪录，全年给国家增加财富十万多斤小米。今年五月七日到二十五日，李文科、吴濮中烧成了青砖二十三万多块，每块青砖只用煤十两零六钱，比去年一块青砖的煤耗，又降低了一两四钱。产品质量比去年也提高了零点二。李文科、吴濮中都说：今后更要多多开动脑筋，钻研生产，努力争取第三次减低烧砖煤耗量，为祖国创造更多的财富。
