(Xinhua News Agency, June 27th) Paris dispatch: The French reactionary authorities are taking all sorts of measures to plant evidence, continuing to illegally imprison Duclos and deprive Duclos of his constitutional right to publicly question the government. This action by the French authorities has been strongly exposed by Duclos himself.
    During the two interrogations on June 7th and 13th, Duclos repeatedly questioned the unconstitutional nature of the illegal arrest and exposed the authorities' frame-up conspiracy. Duclos pointed out: This conspiracy currently being carried out in France is a replica of the so-called "Reichstag Fire" fabricated by the Nazi leader Goering in Germany in 1933 in order to frame the German Communist Party. However, Goering was ultimately unable to escape the people's verdict of hanging. Duclos exposed the blatant lie of the authorities' claim that "the Communist Party is plotting a riot." He pointed out: The anti-Ridgway demonstration on May 28th was not the first popular demonstration of its kind. When former Nazi general Speidel, American generals Eisenhower and Bradley, and others came to Paris, the people held similar protests. Duclos demanded his immediate release.
    On the 14th, Duclos's defense lawyer requested that the preliminary investigation magistrate, Jacquino, temporarily release Duclos so that he could question the government's unconstitutional arrest in the National Assembly. On the 16th, Duclos wrote to Herriot, the Speaker of the National Assembly, requesting that measures be taken to enable him to attend the parliament to question the government. In the letter, Duclos pointed out that the Pinay government arrested him on the orders of the American occupiers, just as the arrest of the national hero and Communist Gabriel Péri in 1941 was carried out on the instructions of the Nazi occupiers. The government's fabrication of charges to persecute the French Communist Party is merely the beginning of a fascist conspiracy. According to the Vichyites' plan, all working people, all patriots, and all democrats are to be threatened.
    Since the French authorities cannot produce any evidence of a crime, they are obviously afraid to allow Duclos any opportunity to meet the public. They have stubbornly rejected all requests from Duclos and his defense lawyer for release and questioning, and continue to frantically fabricate the basis for the frame-up. Duclos has written to Speaker Herriot, protesting the unreasonable act of depriving members of parliament of the right to question in the National Assembly. He refuted one by one the various charges fabricated by the authorities and emphasized that, under the actions of the masses, nothing in the world can stop the truth from coming to light, nor can anything save the French ministers from failure and the bankruptcy of their conspiracy.

    杜克洛痛斥法政府诬陷阴谋和非法逮捕
   【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国反动当局采取种种栽赃措施，继续非法监禁杜克洛，并剥夺杜克洛公开提出质问的宪法权利。法国当局的这种行动，已受到杜克洛本人有力的揭发。
    在六月七日和十三日的两次审讯中，杜克洛一再质问当局非法进行逮捕的违宪行为，并且揭露了当局的诬陷阴谋。杜克洛指出：目前在法国进行的这一阴谋，是一九三三年德国纳粹头子戈林为了诬陷德国共产党而制造的所谓“国会纵火案”的翻版。可是戈林终于无法逃避人民对他的绞刑判决。杜克洛拆穿了当局硬说“共产党阴谋暴动”的弥天大谎。他指出：五月二十八日的反李奇微大示威，并不是第一次这一类的人民示威。在前纳粹将领斯派达尔、美国将军艾森豪威尔和布莱德雷以及其他一些人到巴黎时，人民都举行了同样的抗议示威。杜克洛要求立即把他释放。
    十四日，杜克洛的辩护律师要求预审推事雅基诺暂时释放杜克洛，使他能够就政府逮捕他的违宪行径，在国民议会中提出质问。十六日，杜克洛写信给国民议会议长赫里欧，要求采取措施，使他能够出席议会对政府提出质问，杜克洛在信中指出：比内政府是奉美国占领者的命令逮捕他的，就像一九四一年逮捕民族英雄、共产党人加伯列—贝丽时是按照纳粹占领者的指示行事一样。政府捏造罪名来迫害法国共产党，这只不过是法西斯阴谋的开端。按照维希分子的计划，全体劳动人民、一切爱国者和民主分子都要受到威胁。
    法国当局既提不出任何犯罪的证据，显然不敢让杜克洛有任何机会和公众见面，就蛮横地拒绝了杜克洛和他的辩护律师关于释放和进行质问的一切要求，而继续狂热地捏造陷害的根据。杜克洛已写信给议长赫里欧，抗议剥夺议员在国民议会提出质问权利的无理行动。他一一驳斥了当局所捏造的各种罪名，并且着重指出：在人民群众的行动下，世界上任何东西都阻挡不了真相的大白，都挽救不了法国部长们的失败和阴谋的破产。
