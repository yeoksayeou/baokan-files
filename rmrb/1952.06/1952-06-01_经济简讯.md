    Economic Briefs
    ▲ For this summer's flood prevention work in East China, in addition to the Huai River basin, efforts will be made to ensure that 36 million mu of land out of the 39 million mu affected by floods in 1949 will not be affected by floods again. At the same time, guarantee that 52 million mu of land will not suffer from drought during a 30-day rainless period. During the past winter and spring, farmers in East China collectively repaired more than 800,000 medium-sized and small-sized water conservancy projects such as ponds, dams, canals, and culverts. By the end of April, large-scale water conservancy projects invested or loaned by local people's governments had completed more than 48 million cubic meters of earthwork and 800,000 cubic meters of stonework. The area of farmland threatened by floods in East China has been greatly reduced. Except for the Huai River, the projects to divert and control the Shu River and Yi River in Shandong and northern Jiangsu can be completed before the flood season this year. The dikes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have now been raised to about one meter above the highest flood level in previous years. Many small rivers in the water network of southern Jiangsu have been dredged, and dikes have also been repaired.
    ▲ After Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province implemented the system of livestock health care, the mortality rate of draft animals has been greatly reduced. The system is: 42 veterinarians who have been certified and trained form county and district veterinary stations, and all veterinarians are organized into groups, dividing epidemic prevention responsibility areas. Veterinarians in charge of the districts conduct in-depth publicity to farmers about the benefits of prevention over treatment and the system of livestock health care, mobilizing livestock farmers and veterinary stations to sign livestock health care contracts. The contract stipulates that livestock farmers pay the veterinary station 7 to 10 jin of millet per draft animal per year for health care fees (free for those under two years old). The veterinary station regularly checks the health of livestock from household to household, at least once a month, and guides livestock farmers to improve feeding management methods and pay attention to livestock hygiene. When draft animals are sick, the veterinary station provides free treatment, arriving promptly upon request, and charges 10% less for medicines. This system is very popular among farmers.
    ▲ In order to help herdsmen of all ethnic groups develop production, the Xinjiang Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government have dispatched more than 900 cadres to form the Ili and Tacheng pastoral area work groups, which went to Gongha, Gongliu, Xinyuan, Tekes, Zhaosu, Wenquan, Emin, Yumin, and Feng, Tuoli and other ten county pastoral areas in Ili and Tacheng on May 13, with a scheduled time of three months. The work group is accompanied by medical teams and trade teams. The medical teams will widely publicize health knowledge and provide free treatment for herdsmen's diseases. The trade teams will carry a large number of daily necessities such as tea, cloth, and sugar to supply to herdsmen, and purchase large quantities of wool and promote local products and special products to promote the exchange of materials between urban and pastoral areas.
    ▲ This year, the supply of fertilizers by cooperatives in East China has adopted various methods based on the different conditions of regions and the masses. In areas where the masses have strong purchasing power, the main method is to purchase directly or exchange fertilizers at a price based on the value of real objects. For example, the Wendeng Special District Cooperative in Shandong first helped the masses sell raw rice and kenaf, and then mobilized the masses to purchase fertilizers with cash. For poor farmers and areas with insufficient purchasing power, the main method is to supply fertilizers on credit or through pre-ordering. For example, the Qimen County Cooperative in southern Anhui has already sold 390,891 jin of fertilizer on credit and pre-ordered more than 274,000 jin of tea and more than 91,000 jin of rapeseed. In areas with agricultural production mutual aid groups, fertilizers are mainly supplied by signing joint contracts with mutual aid groups or members' groups.
    ▲ Last year, the crops in Shijiazhuang Special District suffered from pests such as cotton aphids and spider mites. In order to prevent the recurrence of local insect pests, the Shijiazhuang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased a large amount of tobacco leaves, cotton oil soap, sulfur, arsenic, alkali blocks, and new-style insecticide sprayers from various places this year, and made specific allocations according to the size of the cotton fields in each county. And issued an urgent notice, instructing the county cooperatives to immediately designate special personnel to be responsible for receiving various medicines and quickly forwarding them to the grassroots cooperatives, so as to supply them to farmers in time.
    ▲ In order to welcome the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign to be launched in North China in June, the People's Government of Chahar Province held the Second Provincial Industrial Labor Model Conference from May 1 to 7. The meeting resolved that through this competition, we must conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, overfulfill the national production plan for 1952, and ensure the completion and exceeding of the task of increasing production and practicing thrift by 300 billion yuan.
    ▲ The workers of the Zhenchuilu workshop of the Smelting Department of the Shenyang Smelting Plant launched a campaign to find "skills" and summarized various advanced operating methods of each group to improve and consolidate the actual recovery rate of copper smelting into the "Fast Copper Smelting Method with Large Airflow Slagging" using the Kovalev method. Then, according to the production level that can be achieved by this advanced operation method, the workshop set the target for increasing production and practicing thrift. In this way, the entire workshop can increase production and save the state 3,706 tons of grain worth of wealth from May to the end of the year.

    经济简讯
    ▲华东区今夏的防汛工作，除淮河流域外，要保证在一九四九年受水灾的三千九百多万亩土地中的三千六百多万亩土地再不受水灾；同时保证五千二百多万亩土地，在三十天不雨的干旱季节不受旱灾，去冬今春华东全区农民共修好塘坝、水渠、涵闸等中型、小型水利工程八十多万处。各地人民政府投资或贷款兴修的大型水利工程，到四月底，共完成土方工程四千八百多万公方，石方八十万公方。华东全区受水灾威胁的农田已大大减少。除淮河外，山东和苏北的导治沭河、沂河的工程今年汛前就可完成；长江下游的堤防，现在都已加高到超过当地历年最高洪水位一公尺左右。江南水网中的许多小河都疏浚过，堤圩也修好了。
    ▲山西省长治专区推行耕畜保健看槽制度后，耕畜死亡率大大降低。这个制度是：由四十二个经过鉴定合格和受过训练的兽医，组成县、区兽医站，并把所有兽医组织成小组，划分防疫责任区，由分区负责的兽医向农民深入宣传防重于治和耕畜保健看槽制度的好处，发动养畜户和兽医站订立牲畜保健看槽合同。合同规定：养畜户每年每头耕畜给兽医站七至十斤小米的保健费（二岁以下者免费），兽医站定期逐户检查耕畜的健康状况，至少每月检查一次，同时指导养畜户改进饲养管理方法和注意耕畜卫生。耕畜有病时，由兽医站免费治疗，随请随到，用药按九折收费。这个制度很受农民的欢迎。
    ▲为帮助各族牧民发展生产，中国共产党中央新疆分局和新疆省人民政府抽调了九百多名干部，组成伊犁、塔城牧区工作团，在五月十三日分赴伊犁、塔城两专区的巩哈、巩留、新源、特克斯、昭苏、温泉、额敏、裕民、和丰、托里等十县牧区工作，时间预定为三个月。工作团附设医疗队和贸易队，医疗队将广泛宣传卫生常识，并免费给牧民治疗疾病；贸易队携带大批茶、布、糖等日用物品，供应牧民，并大量收购羊毛，推销土产品特产品，以促进城市和牧区的物资交流。
    ▲今年华东区合作社的肥料供应工作，根据地区和群众的不同条件，采用了各种方式。在群众购买能力较强的地区，主要采取现购或以实物作价交换肥料的方式。如山东文登专区合作社，首先帮助群众推销了生米和洋麻，再发动群众以现金购买肥料。对贫苦农民和购买力不足的地区，主要采取了赊销订购的供肥方式。如皖南祁门县合作社已赊销肥料三十九万零八百九十一斤，预购了茶叶二十七万四千多斤、菜籽九万一千多斤。在有农业生产互助组的地区，主要以互助组或社员小组为单位，采取订立结合合同的方式供应肥料。
    ▲去年石家庄专区的农作物曾遭受棉蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害。为了防止当地虫害再度发生，石家庄专区供销合作总社今年由各地买来大批烟叶、棉油皂、硫磺、信石、碱块，新式杀虫喷雾器等，根据各县棉田面积大小作了具体分配，并发出紧急通知，指示各县社马上确定专人负责接受各种药品迅速转发至基层社，以便及时供给农民使用。
    ▲为迎接六月份在华北地区开展的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，察哈尔省人民政府于五月一日到七日召开了全省第二届工业劳动模范会议。会议决议，要通过这次竞赛，认真地贯彻经济核算制，超额完成一九五二年的国家生产计划，保证完成并超过增产节约三千亿元的任务。
    ▲沈阳冶炼厂熔炼部真吹炉车间职工开展找“窍门”运动，把各小组提高与巩固炼铜实收率的各种先进操作方法，用郭瓦廖夫方法综合为“大风流渣快速炼铜法”。然后根据这个先进操作法可以达到的生产水平，订出了车间增产节约的指标。这样，全车间从五月起到年底可为国家增产节约三千七百零六吨粮食的财富。
