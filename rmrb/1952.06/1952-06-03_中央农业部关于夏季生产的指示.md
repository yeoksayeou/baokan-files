Ministry of Agriculture's Instructions on Summer Production

	This spring, the drought prevention movement has been carried out in depth in various regions. Rainfall has been relatively even in many areas, and sowing has been completed on time in most areas. In order to implement the State Council's decision on agricultural production in 1952, ensure the realization of increased yield per unit area, and complete the agricultural production increase plan, doing a solid job in summer production will be a decisive key. To successfully complete the summer production tasks, all regions must overcome the slack and paralysis that has grown due to the smooth spring sowing, and timely overcome disasters such as drought, floods, insects, and hail; they must earnestly organize the masses to implement all feasible high-yield technologies in summer production; and they must promote and complete various specific production tasks through the rectification and development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Regarding the current summer production situation and characteristics, several main tasks are proposed below, which are to be studied and implemented.
    I. Strengthen the prevention and control of insect pests and diseases. Wheat aphids occurred universally this spring, which has not happened for many years. Although they have been wiped out, some areas have already suffered yield reductions. At present, insect pests such as cotton aphids, locusts, and rice borers are occurring successively. All regions should continue to follow the spirit of the State Council's "Emergency Notice on the Prevention and Control of Insect Pests" issued on April 22, and organize the masses to carry out prevention and control in a timely manner. In the vast cotton areas, in addition to vigorously implementing the policy of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment" to eliminate cotton aphids, red spiders, and other insect pests, it is also necessary to work closely with supply and marketing cooperatives to prepare pesticides and machinery, so that pesticides are available when insect pests occur. Insect pests of fruit trees, especially pests of citrus and apples, as well as regional pests such as rice case worms, rice locusts, bamboo locusts, armyworms, crickets, and leafhoppers, must also be actively controlled. In spring wheat areas, surveys of wheat smut should be conducted, and the masses should be mobilized to remove diseased plants. In winter wheat areas, seed dressing agents and white arsenic and red arsenic for controlling underground pests should be prepared as much as possible.
    II. Continue to implement the Central Drought Prevention Office's notice of May 7, and carry out the drought prevention and resistance movement more deeply, inspect and repair all drought prevention facilities, and strengthen water management. Areas prone to waterlogging should also dredge ditches and waterways and do a good job in flood prevention.
    III. Promote high-yield technologies, and do a good job in summer cultivation and planting, weeding and seedling protection, and manure accumulation and fertilization. Advanced cultivation techniques are most easily embodied by the masses in the summer production stage. State-run farms in various countries should combine local natural conditions and the experience of high-yield models to create typical examples and disseminate them in a timely manner. In addition to the timely completion of summer cultivation and planting in wheat fields in various places (the Ministry has already issued instructions on May 6), weeds must be diligently removed from summer crop fields to ensure clean land and strong seedlings. At the same time, a summer grass cutting and manure accumulation movement should be carried out, and the masses should be organized to repair and pad stables and pens, and cut grass and compost manure in large quantities; in plain areas, all weeds on the edges of fields and roadsides should be removed, and in mountainous areas, weed removal should be combined with soil and water conservation, correcting the tendency to scrape sod for manure accumulation in winter and spring. Topdressing should be increased, and the masses should be organized to carry it out according to the principle of "concentrated application and application in stages." Oil cake used as topdressing must be applied after full fermentation to accelerate fertilizer efficiency, and should be applied before flowering and heading (cotton should be applied before full bloom). Individual labor models have a tendency to apply a large amount of topdressing at one time or in multiple applications in order to strive for high yields. They should be persuaded to increase the application steadily according to the past fertilization level, and apply it in two or three applications. The supply of fine fertilizer and green manure seeds should be completed in a timely manner in conjunction with the cooperative departments.
    IV. In order to protect the health of livestock, all regions should conscientiously organize the masses to cut and harvest summer grass in a timely manner and prepare winter feed. Agricultural areas lacking feed should prepare alfalfa seeds and focus on promoting planting. Pastoral areas should implement reasonable zoning grazing methods in summer, and plan to reserve winter pastures. Summer is the season for the birth of young animals and suitable for breeding. All regions should strengthen the health care of young animals and the breeding of livestock. Epidemic diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, blackleg, swine fever, and swine erysipelas are prone to occur in summer, and prevention and control must be strengthened and eradicated in a timely manner.
    V. During the summer fishing slack season, education and organization of fishermen should be strengthened, and fishermen's production cooperative organizations should be rectified and developed; and ship repairs and net mending should be actively carried out to prepare for the autumn fishing season. Paddy fields in rice areas should be promoted for fish farming with emphasis. Coastal fishing areas should pay attention to preventing typhoons.
    VI. Rectify and develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations. On the basis of spring production, further carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Complete various summer production tasks. All regions should promptly check the extent to which the spring production plans of all mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have been implemented, and revise the more practical summer production plans to fully exploit the potential for increased production, help them solve specific problems within the organization, and improve various systems. In the gaps between agricultural work, cooperative mutual aid representative meetings and small technical training classes should be held with the county and district as units to learn advanced mutual aid and cooperation experience and high-yield technologies, improve the leadership ability of the leading backbone of mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, and enrich the content of mutual aid organizations, so as to drive the broad masses to more actively participate in the patriotic production increase movement.

    中央农业部关于夏季生产的指示
    今年春季各地生产防旱运动深入开展，很多地区雨水较为调匀，大部地区的播种工作都已适时完成。为了贯彻政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定，保证实现提高单位面积产量，完成农业增产计划，切实作好夏季生产工作将是决定性的关键。为胜利完成夏季生产任务，各地必须克服因春播顺利而滋长的松懈麻痹情绪，及时战胜旱、涝、虫、雹等灾害；必须认真地组织群众在夏季生产中贯彻实现一切有条件、有可能采用的丰产技术；必须通过整顿和发展互助合作组织推动和完成各项具体生产工作。现就今年夏季生产情况及特点，提出几项主要任务，希研究执行。
    一、加强虫害和病害的防治工作。今春麦蚜普遍发生，为多少年来所未有，虽经扑灭，但部分地区已形成减产。目前棉蚜、蝗虫、稻螟等害虫陆续发生，各地仍应遵照四月二十二日中央人民政府政务院“关于防治害虫的紧急通知”的精神，及时组织群众进行防治。在广大棉区除大力贯彻“及早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的方针以消灭棉蚜、红蜘蛛等害虫外，还须结合供销合作社抓紧准备药械，做到虫害发生时有药可用。对于果树害虫，特别是柑橘、苹果等果品的害虫，以及稻苞虫、稻蝗、竹蝗、行军虫、蟋蟀、浮尘子等区域害虫，亦须积极进行除治。在春麦地区应进行黑穗病的调查，并动员群众拔除病株。冬麦地区应尽量准备拌种药剂及防治地下害虫用的白砒、红砒。
    二、继续贯彻中央生产防旱办公室五月七日的通知，更深入地开展防旱抗旱运动，检查与整修一切防旱设施，加强用水管理。易受水涝地区并要疏浚沟洫，作好防涝工作。
    三、推广丰产技术，做好夏耕夏种、除草保苗、积肥施肥等工作。先进的栽培技术在夏季生产阶段最易为群众所体现，各国营农场应结合当地自然条件和丰产模范的经验，作出典型，及时传播。除各地麦田应及时完成夏耕夏种外（本部五月六日已有指示），夏季作物生长的田地，必须勤除杂草，保证地净苗旺。同时并应开展夏季割草积肥运动，组织群众修垫厩舍，大量割草沤粪；平原地区要清除一切地边道旁杂草，山区清除杂草要与水土保持相结合，纠正在冬春两季刮草皮积肥的偏向。增施追肥，应组织群众根据“集中施、分期施”的原则进行。油饼作追肥，须于充分发酵后施用，以加速肥效，并应在开花孕穗前施完（棉花在盛花前施完）。个别劳动模范为争取高额产量，有一次大量施用或分多次施用追肥的偏向，应说服他们根据过去施肥水平稳步增施，并分两次或三次施用。细肥和绿肥种子的供应工作应结合合作部门及时完成。
    四、为保护牲畜健康，各地应认真组织群众及时刈割伏草，作好冬季饲料的准备。缺乏饲料的农业区应准备苜蓿种子，有重点地提倡种植。牧业区应在夏季实行合理分区放牧办法，有计划地留出冬季牧地。夏季是幼畜初生和适宜配种的季节，各地应加强幼畜保健和牲畜配种工作。口蹄疫、牛瘟、气肿疽、猪瘟、猪丹毒等疫病在夏季容易发生，必须加强防治，及时扑灭。
    五、夏季渔闲期间，应加强对渔民的教育组织工作，整顿与发展渔民生产合作组织；并积极修船补网，为秋季渔汛作好准备。水稻区应有重点地推行稻田养鱼。沿海渔区应注意预防暴风。
    六、整顿与发展互助合作组织。在春季生产的基础上，进一步开展互助合作运动。完成夏季各项生产任务。各地应及时检查所有互助组，农业生产合作社的春季生产计划执行程度，并修订更切实际的夏季生产计划，充分发挥提高生产的潜在能力，帮助他们解决组织内部的具体问题，改进各项制度。在农事间隙，应以县区为单位召开合作互助代表会议及小型技术训练班，学习先进的互助合作经验和丰产技术，提高互助组和生产合作社领导骨干的领导能力，充实互助组织的内容，以便带动广大群众更积极地投入爱国增产运动。
