The CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, the Central-South Military Region, the leading Party, government, and military organs of Hubei and Hunan provinces, and various people's organizations in Hubei Province have sent telegrams to the General Headquarters of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and all its staff, congratulating them on the successful completion of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project.

The congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, and the Central-South Military Region pointed out: The great and arduous Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, completed ahead of schedule, "is a miracle in the engineering records of Chinese history. It fully demonstrates the excellent qualities of the brave and hardworking people of our motherland in the Mao Zedong era and marks the superiority of the new democratic social system." The congratulatory telegram emphasized that the successful completion of this project will effectively eliminate the flood threat of the Jingjiang River, ensure the safety of the lives and property of the vast people of Hubei and Hunan, and consolidate the smooth flow of navigation on the Yangtze River.
