The U.S. aggressors' continued manipulation of their bankrupt "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" schemes is the sole obstacle to reaching an agreement in the Korean armistice negotiations. The new U.S. chief negotiator, Harrison, shamelessly repeats Joye's platitudes at the negotiation table; and to our chief representative's righteous questioning and protest regarding the U.S. massacre of our captured personnel, not only does he fail to provide any explanation or response, but he frequently "suggests a recess," attempting to evade responsibility and refuse negotiation. This attitude of the U.S. fully demonstrates that it has no sincerity in reaching an agreement in the negotiations.

If the U.S. is like this at the negotiation meetings, it is even more frantically carrying out bloody massacres of our captured personnel in its prisoner-of-war camps. The new U.S. prisoner-of-war camp负责人, Bonner, upon arriving at Geoje Island, has openly announced that he will implement a "tough policy" towards our captured personnel, and has dispatched a large number of armed forces to Geoje Island and Busan to carry out the bloody task of massacring our captured personnel. According to U.S. news agencies: the U.S. again killed and wounded eleven of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp on May 17, 29, and 30; killed and wounded eighty-six of our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp on May 20; and killed and wounded sixteen of our captured personnel in the Yeongcheon prisoner-of-war camp on May 29. In addition, according to news recently revealed by U.S. news agencies: the U.S. also conducted another bloody massacre on Geoje Island on April 10, killing and wounding more than sixty of our captured personnel. While creating this series of bloody atrocities, the U.S. executioners are frantically preparing to continue to carry out larger-scale massacres and persecutions of our captured personnel. U.S. Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet has personally visited Geoje Island three times to arrange suppression measures; and U.S. Commander-in-Chief in Korea, Clark, openly clamored on May 23 that he had ordered the U.S. military in the Busan and Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camps to use "concussion grenades," "tear gas bombs," and so-called "riot suppression tactics" against our captured personnel. Now, the U.S. aggressors are insidiously spreading rumors, saying that our captured personnel are "establishing an army" and manufacturing weapons; while transferring accomplice troops from Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and Greece to Geoje Island to strengthen their power to create bloody atrocities and to have them share the responsibility. Obviously, the U.S. aggressors are endlessly delaying and further undermining the prisoner-of-war issue, which is the only obstacle to reaching an agreement in the Korean armistice negotiations, in order to create tension and conspire to continue to expand the war of aggression against Korea.

The atrocities of the U.S. aggressors have aroused the anger of peace-loving people in all countries. The working people of Moscow held a city-wide protest rally on May 29, passing a resolution denouncing the U.S.'s absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation" in violation of international law and humanitarian principles, and calling for an end to the bloody atrocities of the U.S. aggressors; public opinion in the people's democracies of Eastern Europe unanimously condemned the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors. The people of the United States and other capitalist countries have also expressed unrestrained anger at the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors. Peace-loving people all over the world are demanding sanctions against the crimes of the U.S. murderers. Our chief negotiator, General Nam Il, has issued a serious warning to the U.S.: the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers absolutely cannot sit idly by while their captured comrades are arbitrarily massacred by the U.S. For the sake of the Korean armistice, the U.S. must withdraw its absurd proposition of detaining our captured personnel and immediately stop the bloody massacre of our captured personnel. Peace-loving people all over the world support our just proposition and are carrying out a resolute struggle to stop the bloody atrocities of the U.S. aggressors and achieve the Korean armistice.

### 美国在朝鲜的旧阴谋和新暴行

    美国在朝鲜的旧阴谋和新暴行
    美国侵略者继续玩弄其破了产的所谓“自愿遣返”和“甄别”的骗局，是目前阻挠朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的唯一障碍。新任美方首席谈判代表哈利逊在谈判会上，恬不知耻地重复着乔埃的滥调；而对我方首席代表关于美方屠杀我被俘人员的义正辞严的质询和抗议，不仅没有作任何交代和答复，且经常“建议休会”，企图逃避罪责和拒绝协商。美方这种态度，充分表明它没有使谈判达成协议的诚意。
    美方在谈判会议上是如此，在其战俘营中更疯狂进行屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥勾当。新任美方战俘营负责人波纳在到达巨济岛之后，已公开宣布要对我方被俘人员实行“强硬政策”，并调遣了大批武装部队到巨济岛和釜山去执行屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥任务。据美方通讯社报道：美方又于五月十七日、二十九日和三十日三天内，在巨济岛战俘营中打死打伤我方被俘人员十一名；五月二十日在釜山战俘营中打死打伤我方被俘人员八十六名；五月二十九日又在永川战俘营打死打伤我方被俘人员十六名。此外，据美方通讯社最近才透露出来的消息：美方还于四月十日在巨济岛进行了另一次血腥屠杀，打死打伤我方被俘人员达六十余名。美国刽子手们在制造这一连串的血腥暴行的同时，并疯狂准备继续对我方被俘人员进行更大规模的屠杀和迫害。美国第八军军长范佛里特曾三次亲赴巨济岛布置镇压措置；侵朝美军总司令克拉克于五月二十三日更公开叫嚣，他已下令釜山和巨济岛战俘营的美军对我方被俘人员使用“震荡手榴弹”、“催泪毒气弹”和所谓“镇压暴动的战术”。现在，美国侵略者正一面阴险地制造谣言，说什么我方被俘人员“正在创立军队”和制造武器；一面把英国、加拿大、荷兰和希腊的帮凶军队调往巨济岛，以增强其制造血腥暴行的力量，并要他们分担罪责。显然的，美国侵略者正在这唯一障碍朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的战俘问题上进行无休止的拖延和进一步的破坏，以制造紧张局势，阴谋继续扩大侵朝战争。
    美国侵略者的暴行，已激起各国爱好和平人民的愤怒。莫斯科劳动人民于五月二十九日举行了全市性的抗议集会，通过决议痛斥美方违反国际公法和人道原则的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，号召制止美国侵略者的血腥暴行；东欧人民民主各国的舆论一致谴责美国侵略者的暴行。美国以及其他资本主义国家的人民对美国侵略者的暴行同样表示不可抑止的愤怒。全世界爱好和平的人民都要求对美国杀人犯的罪行进行制裁。我方首席谈判代表南日将军已对美方提出严重警告：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军绝对不能坐视他们被俘的战友遭受美方的恣意屠杀。为了朝鲜停战，美方必须撤回扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，立即停止对我方被俘人员的血腥屠杀。全世界爱好和平的人民都支持我方的正义主张，并为制止美国侵略者的血腥暴行、实现朝鲜停战而进行坚决的斗争。
