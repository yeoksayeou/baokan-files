This Is How I Educate Children
Lü Jingxian, Model Teacher, Jingwei Elementary School, Harbin, Northeast China

(I)

I began working as an elementary school teacher after graduating in 1947. Children are adorable, and living with them is a happy and joyful experience. I feel proud when I think about how my job is to educate these children, to make them cultured, strong, brave, loyal to the motherland, loyal to the cause of Mao Zedong, and future builders and defenders of the motherland.

I have sixty-five students in my class. For five years, I have gone to class with interest every day, and my students have also listened to my lectures with great interest. When I taught the first-graders about "Spring is Coming," I took them to the park to observe the different changes in nature during early spring, mid-spring, and late spring. We observed the melting snow, watched the grass sprout, the flowers bloom, the trees grow fresh green leaves, and the appearance of various animals. During the observation process, the children showed great interest in and love for nature. Everyone discussed: "How fresh and lovely the color of the grass is! No one planted it, how can it grow?" I also reminded them at any time: "How beautiful the singing of birds and the sound of running water are!", "Why does the snow melt first in sunny places?"... Back in the classroom, we extended, reviewed, and consolidated the knowledge gained during the observation, and talked about the joy of the peasant uncles in the spring, and the labor of farming and sowing. I also assigned homework, asking the children to observe the changes in the natural phenomena of spring in the surrounding environment they came into contact with, in the campus, in the courtyard, and on the streets. Afterwards, they were all able to correctly tell me about the phenomena they observed, and they brought back sprouting branches, green grass, lilac flowers, crabapple flowers... and happily filled the vases with them and placed them in the classroom, our classroom was full of the atmosphere of spring. The children said with satisfaction: "We brought spring into the classroom."

The combination of classroom learning and life practice enables children to correctly observe and understand the changes in natural phenomena, acquire solid seasonal knowledge, recognize and appreciate the richness and beauty of natural changes, and love the beauty of the motherland's spring.

In the classroom, I also have indescribable joy. The children listen quietly to me reciting vivid and beautiful poems, and telling interesting stories. We do various interesting object observations and experiments, and sometimes we also paint and sing together. I often prepare systematic teaching materials to inspire them to think. For example, after I told the second-graders about "Spiders Weaving Webs to Catch Flies", the children asked: "Flies carry germs, why don't spiders get sick after eating flies?" What an interesting question! These questions often cause children to think and engage in interesting debates. At the same time, I also often ask children questions, asking them to observe, think, and prove, so that they can consciously understand knowledge.

From the time children enter school, they must cultivate their interest and ability in reading. At the beginning, I taught the children to read the learned texts correctly and fluently in class, and to look at some interesting pictures after class. I told them some short stories about animals, told riddles, and recited short and beautiful poems. I paid attention to awakening a desire in their hearts: "How good it would be if I could read that interesting book myself!" When they entered the second grade, they could already independently read some simple children's books. From the lower grades, we systematically cultivate their interest and ability in reading, and gradually inspire children's love for the motherland's language and literature, and their love for knowledge and books.

From the time the children enter school, I have them practice oral and written composition. For example, when I let the children appreciate a picture of "Horses and Cows Eating Green Grass on the Grass", they said orally: "Sky, horses, cows, eating green grass." But after three months, when they narrated again, they said: "The weather is very warm in spring. The sky is very clear, without a single cloud. The grassland is full of green grass, and horses and cows come to the grassland to eat green grass together. After eating the grass, they are going to work." The children's conversation has connections and is full of life. When writing sentences with the word "I" at the beginning, they wrote: "I pat the ball", "I love Chairman Mao", which were all one or two sentences in parallel. Three months later, when using the word "I" to make sentences again, they could write: "I love Chairman Mao, I want to study hard and be a good child of Chairman Mao." By the end of the first grade and the second semester, general children can write short essays of forty to sixty words. In the second grade, children can start learning independent composition.

In order to make children interested in all classes, I prepare each of my lessons more than once. Although the teaching materials taught each year are almost the same, the teaching methods of teachers cannot be the same, and we must constantly discover and create in our work. The work of a true teacher is indeed a creative work!

(II)

Educating children with the spirit of patriotism is one of the main tasks of school education.

Through classroom teaching, I told the children: how Chairman Mao led the people to carry out arduous struggles, defeated the enemy, and we were able to obtain today's happy life, so that the children could understand the leader's contribution to the motherland and his love for children and the people. How he used all his strength in the past and present to work for the happiness of the people. The children collected photos of the leader engaged in revolutionary activities from newspapers and pictorials and treasured them; they decorated the leader's photos with great love and hung them in their rooms. Once I talked to the children about: "What is the happiest thing for you?" Many children expressed their hopes: "Grow up quickly, and take the train to Beijing to see Chairman Mao."

We must educate children to love the soldiers who defend the motherland, to love our heroic People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, and to hate the enemies of the motherland!

I told the children about the heroic fighting deeds of the soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, so that the children could love the soldiers who defend the motherland, sympathize with and assist the Korean people who are fighting, and hate the US imperialist aggressors.

The children's love for the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army is manifested in their daily lives. They salute when they see the People's Liberation Army, and they automatically give up their seats to the People's Liberation Army on the trams and in the cinemas. The children often write letters to comfort the Volunteer Army uncles, and give their favorite things such as handkerchiefs, photos, books... to the uncles as consolation gifts, and they have established regular correspondence relationships with them. Nine-year-old Xu Zhixian has been corresponding with Uncle Jiang Xuemou of a certain Volunteer Army unit for more than half a year. Not long ago, she received a letter from Uncle Jiang Xuemou, which read: "Little friend Zhixian, we are willing to protect your safe study with our lives, so that you will become builders of the motherland in the future. I am a member of the Volunteer Army, and I sincerely make this guarantee to you!"

How excited and moved the children were to read these letters! The children said: "We must study hard to answer Uncle." They have all established their own lofty ideals, and they want to be combat heroes and labor heroes when they grow up... to build and defend the motherland.

After class, I often take the children for a walk by the river, so that the children can appreciate the beautiful scenery on the Songhua River. I told the children: Our Songhua River produces a lot of white fish every year, and the hydropower of the Songhua River can generate electricity... The children like to play by the river, touching small fish, picking up shells, and picking up pebbles. In the spring and summer seasons, I also often take the children to the park to play, climb mountains, cross bridges, and observe various birds and animals. In the autumn, I sat on the grass, surrounded by children. We observe the clear sky and watch the changes in the clouds. How clear and lovely the sky of the motherland is! Sometimes, we also collect various fallen leaves in the red autumn forest and make beautiful specimens. I also often take the children for a walk on the street to watch the passing vehicles, the wide roads, the neat street trees, and the tall chimneys of the factories... so that the children can be familiar with and love their beautiful city.

In this way, from near to far, we cultivate children to cherish the things that directly surround them, to love our own land, and to love the scenery of their hometown. This kind of love cultivated in childhood will be maintained in the children's entire lives, making them feel that a handful of soil and a grass and a tree in the motherland are very kind and lovely.

When children first enter school from their families, they have some bad thoughts and habits. For example: draw a line on the desk shared by two people, dividing yours and mine, and no one is allowed to infringe on each other; always want to squeeze others behind when drinking water, and drink first; monopolize game equipment and not allow others to play... Therefore, I educate them with the spirit of collectivism, and cultivate and develop their friendly collectivist feelings.

I often influence them through my own actions. For example: one day it rained, and a child's clothes were wet by the rain, and he felt a little cold. When I took off my coat and put it on him, hundreds of sharp eyes of the children watched my actions in surprise. At that time, many children asked to put their coats on him too. Since then, I often see in the classroom that if some students don't have pencils to use, many small hands will raise pencils and compete to lend them to their classmates. If some students ask for sick leave, I am very concerned about inquiring about their illness. I take the children to visit him, or we write letters together to comfort him. These actions have cultivated friendly feelings in the hearts of the children. Since then, whenever a classmate is sick, the children automatically go to visit him and tell him the lessons taught by the teacher.

In order to make all the children in the grade study well friendly and help each other, and make everyone happy for the achievements of everyone in their grade, I often remind the whole grade in this way: "Look, Wang Maoren writes so well today, he can often write so well!" The children said to him: "Wang Maoren, you have made progress, how well you write!" He worked harder. If someone's homework is not good, everyone will help him: "How, you can't do this? Look, it should be like this."

After long-term education in many aspects, friendship has grown among the children, letting younger students drink water first; many children bring their own books to school and share them with all the students; if the desks and chairs in the classroom are broken, everyone will automatically repair them.

(III)

Doing a good job in parental work is an effective way to help teachers complete their teaching tasks, and grasping "mothers" is the main key to doing a good job in parental work. I first conducted universal family visits to understand the family situation and the characteristics of the children, and then invited the mothers to visit our classes, visit children's extracurricular activities, participate in children's entertainment parties, field trips... In this way, we established a close relationship, and then organized the grade's parent committee, and the parent committee convened a mothers' meeting when necessary. The time for each of our meetings is not long. Sometimes I give the mothers some short thematic speeches, such as: "How to guide children to complete homework at home", "How to organize children's extracurricular time", etc.

In terms of health education, mothers have helped me a lot. I first conducted a survey and research on the health status of children at home, and then I gave a speech on "Children's Health" to the mothers, pointing out the importance of paying attention to children's health at home, and put forward several specific requirements that they can achieve, for example, mothers must personally check every morning before the children go to school: whether the children's hands, faces, and clothes are clean; do not let children drink raw water at home; urge children to get up and sleep on time, and ensure sleep time, etc. At the meeting, the mothers discussed and put forward opinions, methods, and experiences. Everyone enthusiastically challenged each other and promised to be model mothers. They said: "The teacher has to take care of more than sixty children alone. We only take care of a few children alone, we must take good care of the children, otherwise we are really sorry for the teacher." Since then, the children's hygiene habits and health conditions have improved greatly. At the meeting to celebrate the "June 1" Children's Day, we encouraged all the mothers and praised the mothers who had made achievements in health, and the children gave flowers and speeches to all the mothers; the children said: "Thank you mom for taking care of us, we will study hard and listen to mom, so that mom will be happy." This also encouraged all the mothers and made them more concerned about their children's education.

Mothers often automatically come to listen to my lectures, inquire about the children's situation, and tell me about the children's situation at home. They supervise the children's study at home and guide their extracurricular games, which have played a great role. Many mothers have changed their past style of beating and scolding their children. They very much hope to convene a mothers' meeting. Li Yongtai's mother said: "We are not unwilling to educate our children, but we don't know how to educate them. The teacher's speech is of great help to us." On Children's Day and Teachers' Day, the mothers prepared flowers and letters and asked the children to give them to me, expressing their gratitude.

How moved I am by the children's love for me! Nine-year-old Zhang Yusheng saw my photo published in the "March 8" special issue of Songjiang Daily, so he clipped the photo in his book and kept it with him for several months. When his mother asked him for it, he said naively: "Mom, this is my teacher! How can I give it to you?" Sun Dexing wrote in a letter to his father: "Dad, my teacher is so good. When you come back, let's go to see the teacher together!...."

When I see the children who have just studied for a year can write fluent short essays, when I see the growth of their new moral qualities, when I see the healthy and lively appearance of the children on the sports field, when I hear them calling "teacher" kindly, comrades, can you imagine my happy mood? It is the same as when workers see their excellent products, the same as when farmers see their abundant grain, the same as when soldiers eliminate the enemy and capture victory on the battlefield. We have a common joy—that is, we have all contributed our strength to the motherland!

In the near future, we will see the children cultivated with our own efforts engaged in heroic labor on the land of the motherland, building houses, opening up fields and mines, and defending the borders of the motherland...!

(IV)

The care and love of the Party and the government for me are also meticulous.

In July 1951, I once went to the Soviet Union with the counselor delegation selected by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to learn about the work experience of the Young Pioneers. Socialist Soviet Union is our tomorrow. When I saw with my own eyes that our future prospects are so beautiful, and our children's tomorrow will be as happy as Soviet children, how excited and excited I was! In October 1951, twenty-two of us educators were invited to attend the Third Enlarged Meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I was one of them. I saw our dear leader Chairman Mao and shook hands with Chairman Mao. This is my great honor! At the meeting, Comrade Shi Ruifen gave a speech on behalf of all our educators to the meeting. What moved me the most were the first few words of her speech: "I am an ordinary rural elementary school teacher. I not only attended this meeting, but today I can also stand here to speak to the meeting on behalf of all educators. These honors were given to us by Chairman Mao..." When she spoke, Chairman Mao listened so happily, clapping enthusiastically several times. When Comrade Shi Ruifen personally handed the letter written by us on behalf of all educators to Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao personally instructed after reading it: "This letter should be published in the People's Daily." How concerned Chairman Mao is about us!

We are respected and cared for by the country, and our political status in society has been improved. This is something that we could not have dreamed of in the old society. We will gradually improve our lives and improve our work with the prosperity of the motherland's economic construction. We will receive the respect and care that we deserve from the country and the people! Chairman Mao taught us: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, there will be a high tide of cultural construction." Let us better prepare to intensify our work to welcome the advent of the high tide of cultural construction!

In the past year or so, the comrades in our school and myself have constantly received letters from soldiers, workers, staff, and parents of students, narrating the joy of seeing the growth of the new generation, and sincerely expressing their gratitude and respect to the teachers. I myself have received many letters from soldiers. The following is a letter from Comrade Hong Feng of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers: "Comrade Jingxian, in order to defend the children of our own motherland, to defend the children you are educating, we vow—to resolutely eliminate US imperialism in Korea. We dedicate this determination to the distant motherland and to the children of Mao Zedong. ... Please educate the children with peace of mind!" Comrades! Can we not be moved when we read these letters? I treasure these letters so much, they have become the power to encourage me to move forward!

In 1947, I joined the Democratic Youth League. In 1948, I was transferred to a member of the New Democratic Youth League. In 1949, I joined the Communist Party of China. In the arms of our dear motherland, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the government, the Youth League, and with the encouragement and help of comrades, I gradually grew and progressed. In 1949, I was elected as an excellent teacher and an excellent Youth League member in Harbin. In 1951, I was elected as a special model teacher in Songjiang Province. I was elected as a people's representative in Harbin twice and attended the People's Congress. I have been rewarded by the local government several times. In 1950, I attended the National Education Workers' Trade Union Congress and was elected as an executive committee member. In 1951, the Central Committee of the Youth League selected me to study in the Soviet Union. In October of the same year, I was invited to attend the Third Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I have only done a little bit of extremely small work for the people, but the government and the people have given me so much respect and care! All glory should belong to our great leader Chairman Mao, belong to the great Chinese Communist Party that cultivated and educated me, and belong to all the education workers who have worked hard together on the education front!

In order to create a happier life for the children and for ourselves in the future, for our beloved motherland, and for the cause of our dear Comrade Mao Zedong, let us work more faithfully and enthusiastically!

In our motherland, the title of "people's teacher" is something we are proud of!

    我是这样教育孩子们的
    东北哈尔滨市经纬小学模范教师  吕敬先
    （一）
    一九四七年走出了学校后，我就开始作小学教师。孩子们是可爱的，和他们一起生活是幸福和愉快的。我一想起自己的工作是教育这些孩子们，使他们成为有文化教养、坚强、勇敢、忠于祖国、忠于毛泽东事业的、祖国未来的建设者和保卫者，就感到自豪。
    我的班上有六十五名学生。五年以来，我每天都是有兴趣地去上课，我的学生们也同样很有兴趣地听我讲课。我给一年级的孩子们讲“春来了”的时候，我带着孩子们到公园里观察了初春、仲春、春末的不同的大自然现象的变化。我们观察了融雪的情形，看草儿的发芽，花儿的开放，树木长出鲜嫩的绿叶，以及各种动物的出现。在观察的过程中，孩子们对自然界表现了极大的兴趣和爱好，大家谈论着：“小草的颜色有多么新鲜可爱呀！没有人去种它，它怎么就能长出来呢？……”我也随时提醒他们：“鸟儿唱歌的声音，小河流水的声音有多么好听呀！”、“为什么在有阳光的地方，雪就先融化了呢？”……回到课堂上，把观察时所获得的知识加以引伸、复习和巩固，并讲述了农民伯伯在春天里的欢乐，和耕田播种的劳动情况。我又布置了课外作业，让孩子们在自己所接触的周围环境中、校园里、庭院中、街道上，去观察春天大自然现象的变化。事后，他们都能正确地向我讲述所观察的现象，并且从家里带来了发芽的树枝、绿草、丁香花，海棠花……高兴地把它们插满了花瓶，放置在课堂里，我们的课堂里充满了春天的气象。孩子们满意地说：“我们把春天带到课堂里来了。”
    课堂学习和生活实践结合，使孩子们正确地观察和理解大自然现象的变化，获得了巩固的季节知识，认识并领略了自然界变化的丰富和美丽，爱好祖国春天的美。
    在课堂上，我同样有说不出来的快乐。孩子们静听我朗诵生动优美的诗歌，讲述有趣的故事。我们做各种有趣味的实物观察和实验，有时候我们也
    一起绘画和唱歌。我经常准备好有系统的讲述教材，用以启发他们思考。例如我给二年级孩子讲过 “蜘蛛织网捕苍蝇”后，孩子们提出：“苍蝇带有病菌，为什么蜘蛛吃掉苍蝇后不生病呢？”多么有趣味的问题呵！这些问题，常常引起孩子们去思考和展开有兴趣的争论。同时我也常常向孩子们提出问题，要他们去观察、思考和证明，使他们自觉地领会知识。
    从孩子们入学开始，就要培养他们阅读的兴趣和能力。开始时，我教孩子们在课堂上正确地流畅地朗读学过的课文，在课后看一些有趣的画片。我给他们讲一些简短的关于动物的故事，讲述谜语，朗诵简短优美的诗歌。我注意在他们心中唤起一种愿望：“我自己能读读那本有趣的书，该多好呀！”当他们升入二年级后，已经可以独立阅读一些简单的儿童图书了。从低年级起，就有计划地培养他们阅读的兴趣和能力，逐渐启发儿童对于祖国语言、文学的爱好，对于知识和书籍的爱好。
    从孩子们入学开始，我就让他们练习口头和文字的作文。例如我让孩子们欣赏一幅“马和牛在草地上吃青草”的画片时，他们口述说：“天空、马、牛、吃青草。”但是经过了三个月，他们再来叙述时，就说：“春天天气很暖和。天空很晴，没有一点云朵。草地上长满了绿草，马和牛一同到草地上来吃青草。吃完了草，它们就要去工作了。”孩子们的谈话有联系有生气了。最初用“我”字笔述造句时，写着：“我拍球”、“我爱毛主席”，都是一句或两句平列的。三个月后，再用“我”字造句时，他们就能写：“我爱毛主席，我要好好学习，做毛主席的好孩子。”到一年二期结束，一般儿童能写出四十至六十字的短文了。到二年级，孩子们就可以开始学习独立作文了。
    为了使孩子们对于所有的课都有兴趣，我都是不只一次地准备自己的每一课。虽然每年所教的教材几乎都是一样的，但教师的教法却不能是千篇一律，要时刻在工作中去发现和创造。真正的教师的工作确是一件创造性的工作！
    （二）
    以爱国主义精神教育儿童，是学校教育主要任务之一。
    通过课堂教学，我给孩子们讲述：毛主席怎样领导人民进行了艰苦斗争，战胜了敌人，我们才获得今天的幸福生活，使孩子们理解领袖对祖国的功劳、对儿童对人民的热爱。他在过去和现在是怎样用自己的全部力量来为人民的幸福而劳动。孩子们从报纸、画报上搜集领袖从事革命活动的照片，珍重地保存着；他们以极大的爱戴的心情，把领袖的照片装璜起来，挂在自己的房间里。有一次我同孩子们谈起：“你们最高兴的事情是什么？”很多孩子都表示了自己的希望：“快快长大了，要坐火车到北京看看毛主席。”
    要教育孩子们热爱保卫祖国的战士，热爱我们英雄的解放军和志愿军，仇恨祖国的敌人！
    我给孩子们讲述在抗日战争和解放战争中战士们的英勇战斗事迹，讲述在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中中国人民志愿军的英雄事迹，使孩子们热爱保卫祖国的战士，同情和援助正在战斗中的朝鲜人民，仇恨美帝国主义侵略者。
    孩子们对解放军和志愿军的热爱，在他们日常生活中表现出来了。他们见了解放军就敬礼，在电车上，在电影院里，都自动地给解放军让坐。孩子们常常写信慰问志愿军叔叔，把自己心爱的东西如手帕、照片、图书…………送给叔叔做慰问品，并且和他们建立了经常的通信关系。九岁的女孩子徐治娴和叔叔通信有半年多了。不久以前，她接到志愿军某部江学谋叔叔的来信，信上写着：“治娴小朋友，我们愿以生命来保卫你们的安全学习，使你们将来成为祖国的建设者。我是志愿军的一分子，我诚恳地向你提出这个保证！”
    孩子们是多么兴奋感动地读着这些信件！孩子们说：“我们要好好学习，来回答叔叔。”他们都建立了自己远大的理想，长大了要当战斗英雄、劳动英雄…………建设祖国和保卫祖国。
    在课后，我常常带着孩子们到江边去散步，让孩子们欣赏松花江上美丽的风光。我告诉孩子们：我们的松花江每年都出产多量的白鱼，松花江的水力可以发电……。孩子们喜欢在那江边上摸小鱼、拾贝壳、拣石头子玩。在春夏的季节里，我也常常同孩子们一起到公园里去游玩，上山、过桥，观察各种鸟兽。秋天，我坐在草地上，周围坐满了孩子们。我们观察晴朗的天空，看云朵的变化。祖国的天空是多么晴朗可爱呀！有时候，我们也一起在那染着秋季的鲜红色的树林里，收拾各种落叶，做成美丽的标本。我也常常同孩子们一起到街上散步，观看那来往的车辆、宽阔的马路、整齐的街路树、工厂的高高的烟囱……使孩子们熟悉和热爱自己的美丽的城市。
    这样由近到远，培养孩子们去爱护这些直接围绕着他们的事物，爱我们自己的土地，爱家乡的风光。在童年时代培养起来的这种爱，将保持在孩子们整个的一生中，使他们感到祖国的一撮沙土，一草一木都是十分亲切可爱的。
    孩子们刚从家庭进入学校时，他们有一些不好的思想和习惯。例如：把两人共同用的书桌上划上界线，分出你的和我的，谁也不准侵犯谁；喝水时总想把别人挤在后面，自己先喝；独占游戏器具，不准别人玩……因此，我就以集体主义精神教育他们，培养和发展他们友爱的集体主义的感情。
    我常常通过自己的行动来影响他们，例如：有一天下雨，一个孩子的衣服被雨淋湿了，他感觉有些寒冷。当我把自己的外套脱下来给他披上时，孩子们几百只锐敏的眼睛，惊奇地注视着我的行动，当时就有很多孩子要求把自己的外衣也给他穿上。此后，在课堂上我常常看到，有的同学没有铅笔用，马上就会有很多只小手举起铅笔来，争着借给同学用。有的同学请病假了，我很关心打听他的病状，我带着孩子们一起去探望他，或者我们一起写信去安慰他。这些行动都在孩子们心中培植了友爱的感情。此后一有同学害病，孩子们就自动地去探望，还把老师讲的功课告诉他。
    为了使全级的孩子都能友好地用功，互相帮助，使大家为自己同级的每一个人的成绩而高兴，我常常这样提醒全级：“你们看，王茂仁今天写得这样好，他常常能写得这样好！”孩子们就对他说：“王茂仁，你进步啦，你写得有多好呀！”他就更用功了。假如有谁的功课不好，大家便帮助他：“怎么，你不会这样吗？你看，应该这样。”
    经过多方面的长期教育，友爱在孩子们中间生长了，喝水让小同学先喝；很多孩子把自己的图书带到学校，分给全体同学看；课堂里的桌椅坏了，大家就自动地把它修理好。
    （三）
    做好家长工作是帮助教师完成教学任务的一个有效办法，而抓紧“母亲”又是做好家长工作中的主要关键。我首先进行普遍的家庭访问，了解家庭情况和孩子的特点，以后又请母亲们来参观我们上课，参观儿童的课外活动，参加孩子们的游艺会、野游……。这样我们之间就建立了亲密的关系，于是组织了本级的家长委员会，必要时由家长委员会召集母亲会。我们每次会议的时间不长，有时候我来给母亲们做一些简短的专题讲话，例如：“在家庭里如何指导儿童完成课外作业”、“怎样组织儿童的课外时间”等。
    在卫生健康教育方面，母亲们帮助我进行了很多工作。事先我对儿童在家庭里的卫生健康情况做了调查研究，然后我向母亲们做了“儿童卫生”的讲话，指出在家庭里注意儿童卫生健康的重要，提出了几项她们能够做到的具体要求，比方，在每天早上孩子上学前，母亲们一定要亲自检查一下：孩子的手、脸、衣服是否清洁；在家庭里不要让儿童喝生水；督促儿童按时起床、睡眠，保证睡眠时间等。在会上母亲们进行了讨论，提出意见、办法、经验。大家热情地互相挑战，保证要做模范母亲。她们说：“老师一个人要照顾六十多个孩子。我们一个人才照顾几个孩子，一定要把孩子照顾好，要不然也真对不起老师。”此后孩子们的卫生习惯、健康状况，都有了很大的进步。在庆祝“六一”儿童节的大会上，我们鼓励了全体母亲和表扬了在卫生健康方面做得有成绩的母亲，孩子们又给全体母亲献花、献词；孩子们说：“感谢妈妈对我们的照顾，我们要好好学习，听妈妈的话，使妈妈高兴。”这样又鼓舞了全体母亲，使她们更加关心对孩子的教育。
    母亲们常常自动地来听我上课，打听孩子的情况，并把孩子在家里的情况告诉我。她们在家庭里督促孩子学习，指导他们课余游戏，这都起了很大作用。很多母亲改变了过去打骂孩子的作风。她们很希望召开母亲会。李永泰的母亲说：“我们不是不愿意教育孩子，而是不知道应该怎样教育。老师讲话，对我们帮助可大啦。”在儿童节、教师节时，母亲们准备了鲜花和信，让孩子献给我，表示他们感激的心情。
    孩子们对我的爱，使我多么感动啊！九岁的张玉生看见松江日报“三八”特刊登载了我的照片，他就把这张照片夹在书里，几个月一直带在身边。母亲向他要时，他天真地说：“妈妈，这是我的老师呀！我怎么能给您？”孙德兴在给爸爸的信上写着：“爸爸，我的老师真好呀。等您回来时，我们一同去看看老师吧！……。”
    当我看到刚刚学习了一年的孩子，能写出通顺的短文时，看到他们新的道德品质的成长时，看到孩子们健康、活泼的姿态出现在运动场上时，听到他们亲切地叫着“老师”时，同志们，你们能够想像到我那种愉快的心情吗？就同于工人看到自己优良的出品，同于农民看到自己丰收的粮食，同于战士们在战场上歼灭了敌人缴获了胜利品。我们有共同的愉快——就是我们都为祖国贡献了自己的力量！
    在不久的将来，我们将看到用自己的心血培植起来的孩子们在祖国的土地上进行着英勇的劳动，建筑着房舍，开辟着原野和矿山，保卫着祖国的边疆……！
    （四）
    党和政府对我的培养和爱护，也是无微不至的。
    一九五一年七月，我曾经随同中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会选派的辅导员代表队，到苏联去学习少年先锋队的工作经验。社会主义的苏联，是我们的明天。当我亲眼看到我们未来的远景是那样的美丽，我们孩子的明天将同苏联儿童一样的幸福时，我是多么的兴奋和激动啊！一九五一年十月，我们二十二名教育工作者被应邀出席中国人民政治协商委员会第三次扩大会议，我是其中的一个。我看见了我们亲爱的领袖毛主席，并且和毛主席握了手。这是我莫大的光荣！在大会上，史瑞芬同志代表我们全体教育工作者向大会讲话，最使我感动的是她开始的几句话：“我是一个普通的乡村小学教师，我不但出席了这次会议，而且今天我还能站在这里代表全体教育工作者向大会讲话，这些光荣是毛主席给我们的……”当她讲话时毛主席一直是那么高兴地倾听着，几次热烈地鼓掌。当史瑞芬同志把我们代表全体教育工作者写给毛主席的信，亲自递到毛主席的手里时，毛主席当时看过即亲自批示：“此信要在人民日报发表”，毛主席是多么关怀着我们啊！
    我们受到国家的尊重和关怀，我们在社会上的政治地位提高了，这是在旧社会里做梦也想不到的事情。我们将随着祖国经济建设的繁荣，逐渐地改善我们的生活，提高我们的工作，我们将受到国家和人民应有的尊重和关怀！毛主席教导我们说：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，将出现一个文化建设的高潮”，让我们更好地准备着为迎接文化建设高潮的到来而加紧工作吧！
    一年多来，我们学校里的同志和我自己都曾不断地接到战士、工人、职员、学生家长的来信，叙述他们看到新一代成长的喜悦，诚恳地表示对教师的感激和尊敬。我自己曾接到战士们许多封来信，下面是中国人民志愿军某部洪烽同志的来信：“敬先同志，我们为了保卫自己祖国的孩子，保卫你正在教育着的孩子，我们立誓——坚决把美帝国主义消灭在朝鲜，我们把这个决心献给遥远的祖国，献给毛泽东的孩子们。……请你安心地教育着孩子们吧！”同志们！我们读着这些来信时，能够不感动吗？我是多么珍重地保存着这些信件，它成为鼓舞我前进的力量！
    一九四七年我加入了民主青年联盟，一九四八年转为新民主主义青年团团员，一九四九年加入了中国共产党。在亲爱的祖国——母亲的怀抱里，在党和政府、青年团的培养教育下，在同志们的督促和帮助下，我逐渐地成长和进步。一九四九年我被选为哈尔滨市优秀教师和优秀青年团员，一九五一年被选为松江省特等模范教师，我曾两次被选为哈尔滨市人民代表，出席了人民代表会议。我受到地方政府数次的奖励。一九五○年我出席了全国教育工作者工会代表会议，被选为执行委员，一九五一年团中央选派我赴苏联学习，同年十月间应邀出席了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议。我只给人民做了一点点极其微小的工作，政府和人民却给了我那么多的尊敬和关怀！一切光荣应该属于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，属于培养和教育我的伟大的中国共产党，属于在教育战线上共同艰苦奋斗的全体的教育工作者！
    为了给孩子们和给我们自己创造明天的更幸福的生活，为了我们可爱的祖国，为了我们亲爱的领袖毛泽东同志的事业，让我们更忠实热情地工作下去吧！
    在我们的祖国，“人民教师”这个称号，是值得我们骄傲的！
