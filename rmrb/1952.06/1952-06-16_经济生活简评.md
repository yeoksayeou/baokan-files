    Mobilize All Group Workers to Further Tap Potential

    Next, the group of workers discussed specific ways to implement the production increase and conservation plan. There were two main methods. One was to change the organization of labor. To guarantee the task of increasing the production of five air hammers for the entire workshop, the second group had to change the original organization of labor. Workers Liu Qichang and Gao Zhenduo proposed that the original arrangement of one master technician and two apprentices per machine tool be changed to one master technician with three apprentices looking after two machine tools. In this way, one master technician and one apprentice could be saved for every two machine tools. The group now has six machine tools operating on a three-shift system (originally two shifts), without increasing the number of personnel. After the change in labor organization, the group members increased work efficiency by 70% to 100%, and there is also the potential to train a large number of apprentices in practical skills. The other method was to mobilize all group members to continue to find tricks, learn tricks, and tap potential capabilities. The whole group proposed eighteen tricks that could be realized. Han Jiancong suggested implementing multi-tool and multi-edge cutting on the auxiliary tool holder of the large belt machine tool. In this way, 25% of working hours could be saved for each large gear. The group also achieved success in learning advanced operating methods. For example, the spindle speed of the machine tool for machining pistons was increased from 95 rpm to 136 rpm, the depth of cut was increased from 10 mm to 20 mm, and the feed rate was reduced from 30 passes to 10 passes, greatly increasing production efficiency. In May, more than 20 types of machining operations were fully implemented using multi-tool and multi-edge cutting methods.

    To ensure the implementation of the production increase and conservation plan, the second group established a production increase and conservation inspection team. They inspected the implementation of individual guarantee plans and group production increase and conservation plans every Wednesday, analyzed and studied the results of the inspection, and proposed suggestions for improving work. Then, they conducted criticism and self-criticism at the trade union group meeting held regularly on Saturdays. Economic Life Brief Commentary

    Mobilize the Masses to Formulate Good Production Increase and Conservation Plans

    The experience of many mechanical factories in Northeast China in formulating production increase and conservation plans fully demonstrates that to formulate advanced production plans, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, overcome conservative thinking, find tricks, tap potential, and learn from advanced experience. Only in this way can the plans formulated be reasonable and feasible. Such plans can become a guide for the masses' actions, and in the process of implementation, production can be improved and changes in the production management system can be triggered.

    Many industrial and mining enterprises have not yet formulated production increase and conservation plans. The main reason is that the masses have not been mobilized. Some factory leaders simply formulate a plan based on past production targets; or they designate a few staff members or technicians to break down the tasks assigned by the higher-level leading organs into several items and treat them as a plan. This kind of plan is bound to be conservative, unreasonable, and unrealizable. This kind of plan completely loses the positive significance of improving production and improving enterprise management.

    To overcome these shortcomings in planning work, it is first necessary to correct the erroneous views on planning work. Some leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises believe that "making plans is to cope with the higher authorities," which is completely wrong.

    An advanced production plan is not only the goal of struggle for all employees of the factory, but also the blueprint for the implementation of comprehensive production reform. If this
    important work is taken lightly, it will inevitably cause difficulties for the entire production, which must be corrected.

    发动全组工人进一步挖潜力
    接着，该组工人讨论了执行增产节约计划的具体办法。主要的办法有两个。一个是，改变劳动组织。二组要保证全车间增产五台空气锤的任务，必须改变原有的劳动组织。工人刘其昌和高振铎提议，原来一个大技工和两个徒工看一台机床，现在改成一个大技工带三个徒工看两台机床，这样，每两台机床就可以节省一个大技工和一个徒工。现在该组已经有六台机床实行了三班制（原来是两班制），而人员并没有增加。劳动组织改变以后，该组组员提高了工作效率百分之七十到百分之百，并且还有可能培养大批徒工的实际操作能力。另一个办法是发动全组组员继续找窍门、学窍门、挖掘潜在能力。全组提出了有实现可能的十八个窍门。韩见聪建议在大皮带机床的副刀架上，实行多刀多刃切削法。这样，每个大牙轮可以节省工时百分之二十五。该组在学习先进操作法方面也有成绩。如把车活塞的机床转速，由九十五转提高到一百三十六转，吃刀量由十粍提高到二十粍，送刀量由三十道提高到十道，大大地提高生产效率。在五月里，又有二十多种加工活完全实行了多刀多刃切削法。
    为了保证增产节约计划的实现，二组成立了增产节约检查小组。他们每星期三检查一次个人保证计划和小组增产节约计划的执行情况，把检查的结果，加以分析和研究，提出改进工作的意见。然后，在星期六定期召开的工会小组会上展开批评与自我批评。经济生活简评
    发动群众订好增产节约计划
    东北许多机械工厂制订增产节约计划的经验，充分地说明了制订先进的生产计划，必须充分发动群众，克服保守思想，寻找窍门，挖掘潜力，并学习先进经验。只有这样，订出来的计划才能是合理的、可行的。这样的计划才能成为群众行动的指针，在执行过程中，才能把生产提高一步，并引起生产管理制度的改变。
    许多工矿企业，现在还没有订好增产节约计划。主要的原因，就是没有发动群众。有些厂的领导干部，仅仅根据过去的生产指标，随便订出一个计划；或者指定几个职员或技术人员，把上级领导机关分配的任务，分列了几条，就当做计划。这种计划，必然是保守的，不合理的，不能实现的。这种计划完全失掉了提高生产和改进企业经营管理的积极意义。
    要克服计划工作中的这些缺点，必须首先纠正对于计划工作的错误观点。有些工矿企业的领导干部认为“订计划是为了应付上级”，这是完全错误的。
    一个先进的生产计划，不仅是全厂职工的奋斗目标，而且是实现全面生产改革的蓝图，如果对于这
    一个重要工作等闲视之，必然会给全部生产造成困难，这是必须加以纠正的。
