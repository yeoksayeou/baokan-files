(Xinhua News Agency, June 17th) Under the guise of "embargo," American imperialism is implementing a ruthless policy of plunder for "strategic raw materials" in Southeast Asia. This policy has caused a serious crisis in the Malayan rubber industry.

Since the spring of last year, when the U.S. government forcibly implemented the "embargo" policy in Southeast Asia and made U.S. monopoly capital the only major buyer of Southeast Asian rubber, it has taken various measures step by step and systematically to suppress the price of rubber, resulting in a continuous and sharp decline in rubber prices. In March of this year, the U.S. government announced a temporary "suspension of acceptance of low-grade natural rubber from the Far East," causing rubber prices to continue to fall. As a result, rubber prices have fallen from £700 per ton in May of last year to just over £200 per ton currently.

Rubber accounts for approximately 67 percent of Malaya's export trade and has always been an important source of dollars for Britain. Therefore, the fall in rubber prices has first of all worsened the economic situation of the Malayan people, with rubber factories closing down one after another and large numbers of workers losing their jobs. According to Agence France-Presse, Singapore, May 16, many rubber factories in Singapore have closed, with a total of 6,000 workers losing their jobs. According to United Press International, Singapore, June 5, another five large rubber factories in Singapore have recently closed. At the same time, the fall in rubber prices has seriously weakened the economic position of the British Conservative government, causing Britain's already strained dollar reserves to decline more rapidly.

This blatant plundering tactic of U.S. imperialism has aroused contradictions between the U.S. and British imperialism. In order to ease the dissatisfaction of the British side, the U.S. government convened the International Rubber Study Group in Ottawa, Canada, from May 5th to 10th, "held in extreme secrecy." However, due to the sharp divisions between the U.S. and British blocs, the meeting ended in discord. Reuters acknowledged on May 10 that the reason the meeting failed to reach an agreement was "due to disagreements between natural rubber producing countries and the United States, the world's largest rubber importing country."

Under the lesson of harsh facts, more and more people in Malaya have realized the true reason for the tragic fall in rubber prices. According to Agence France-Presse, Singapore, May 17, "Malayan businessmen, who have been deeply hit by the decline in world market rubber prices," "hope to lift the embargo on strategic materials."

### 美国对东南亚实行残酷掠夺政策  马来亚橡胶业发生严重危机

    美国对东南亚实行残酷掠夺政策
    马来亚橡胶业发生严重危机
    【新华社十七日讯】美帝国主义在“禁运”的招牌下，对东南亚的“战略原料”实行了无情的掠夺政策。这种政策已引起马来亚橡胶业的严重危机。
    自从去年春季美国政府在东南亚强制推行“禁运”政策并使美国垄断资本成为东南亚橡胶的唯一大买主以来，它就有步骤地、有计划地采取各种办法，压制橡胶的价格，造成了橡胶价格的直线下泻，不断猛跌。今年三月间，美国政府又宣布暂时“停止接受来自远东的低级天然胶”，使橡胶价格继续下跌。这样，橡胶价格已从去年五月间的每吨七百英镑跌到了目前的每吨二百英镑多一点。
    橡胶在马来亚的出口贸易额中约占百分之六十七，一向是英国获取美元的重要来源。因此，橡胶跌价首先使马来亚人民的经济情况更加恶劣，橡胶工厂纷纷倒闭，大批工人失业。据法新社新加坡五月十六日电透露，新加坡有许多家制胶厂关门，共有六千工人失了业。另据合众社新加坡六月五日电透露，最近新加坡又有五家大制胶厂关闭。橡胶跌价同时又严重地削弱了英国保守党政府的经济地位，使英国的本来就感拮据的美元储备额更加迅速降低。
    美帝国主义这种露骨的掠夺手腕，引起了美、英帝国主义之间的矛盾。为缓和英国方面的不满，美国政府于五月五日至十日，在加拿大渥太华召开了“在极端秘密下举行的”国际橡胶研究会。但是，由于美英集团之间存在着尖锐的分歧，会议最后不欢而散。路透社在五月十日承认：会议不能获得协议的原因，是“由于生产天然胶的国家和美国这个世界最大的橡胶进口国家之间意见不一致”。
    在冷酷的事实的教训下，马来亚已有越来越多的人们认识到了橡胶价格惨跌的真正原因。据法新社新加坡五月十七日透露：“深受世界市场橡胶价格下跌打击的马来亚商界人士”，“希望解除对战略物资的禁运。”
