    Sixteen. Gao Guandou not only generally promoted the production movement of the farmers in Dahuojia Village, but also guided the farmers towards the road of cooperative economy. In 1944, he organized a weaving cooperative. Originally, buying a bolt of cloth from outside cost 60 jin of millet, but weaving it yourself only cost 20 jin. The farmers recognized the benefits of the cooperative and enthusiastically joined it.

    Seventeen. In 1949, Gao Guandou changed the original dividend-paying cooperative into a supply and marketing cooperative. Initially, some people said, "If there is no profit and no dividends, who will join?" The Communist Party members all invested in shares. The cooperative bought goods from the district supply and marketing cooperative and sold them to the members at the original price, with each mat costing four jin of wheat less than the market price. This improved the farmers' understanding of the cooperative, and they were all willing to join it.

    Eighteen. This January, Gao Guandou attended the production conference held by the Hebei Provincial People's Government. After hearing the government's call to organize land cooperatives, he reorganized the existing mutual aid teams into land cooperatives according to everyone's opinions after returning to the village, and organized the masses to engage in sideline production, such as making maltose and raising pigs for manure. This not only improved the lives of the members, but also laid the foundation for this year's bumper harvest.

    Nineteen. Gao Guandou and his cooperative members, looking at the green wheat fields they had cultivated with their own hands, unanimously expressed their determination to consolidate the existing production achievements, continue to improve production technology, and guarantee a bumper harvest.

    农业劳动模范高贯斗
    李桦　于学信作
    十六、高贯斗不但一般地推动了大护驾庄农民的生产运动，而且引导农民走向合作经济的道路。一九四四年，他组织了织布合作社。原来从外面买回的布每匹需要六十斤小米，自己织的只要二十斤。农民们认识到合作社的好处，踊跃地参加合作社。
    十七、一九四九年，高贯斗把原来分红的合作社改为供销合作社。最初有人说：“不图利，不分红，谁还加入呢？”共产党员们都入股了。合作社从区供销社买来的物品，照原价卖给社员们，每张席子比市价便宜四斤麦子。这样便提高了农民对合作社的认识，他们都愿意加入合作社了。
    十八、今年一月间，高贯斗参加了河北省人民政府召开的生产会议，听到政府号召组织土地合作社，回庄后便按照大家意见，把原有的互助组改组为土地合作社，组织群众进行副业生产，如制造麦芽糖、养猪积肥。这样不但改善了社员的生活，而且为今年的丰产打下基础。
    十九、高贯斗和他的社员们看着他们亲手耕种的一片绿油油的麦田，一致表示要巩固现有的生产成绩，继续改进生产技术，保证丰收。
