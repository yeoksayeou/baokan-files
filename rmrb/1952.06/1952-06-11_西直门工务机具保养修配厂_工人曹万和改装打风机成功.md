    Xizhimen Engineering Tool Maintenance and Repair Factory
    Worker Cao Wanhe Successfully Modified Air Compressor

    Our factory, the Xizhimen Engineering Tool Maintenance and Repair Factory, had a broken steam horizontal air compressor with almost all of its parts missing. To use this air compressor, the factory equipped it with an old locomotive boiler with 120 horsepower. However, this set of machinery remained idle. Cao Wanhe, a worker in the machine assembly team, was determined to repair it. He thought that if he used electricity and modified a motor, he could drive the air compressor and save the cost of using the boiler. Cao Wanhe's plan received support from the leadership. Since the factory had no spare parts, he collected scrap from the scrap pile. Many parts were fitted after being modified many times. After more than ten days of continuous effort by himself and with the help of his colleagues in the team, he finally successfully modified the air compressor.

    西直门工务机具保养修配厂
    工人曹万和改装打风机成功
    编辑同志：北京西直门工务机具保养修配厂原有一台残缺的蒸汽卧式打风机，机上的零件差不多掉光了。为了使用这台打风机，厂里设备了一台一百二十匹马力的旧机车锅炉。但是，这套机器还只能闲放着。机装组工人曹万和决心把它修好。他想，如果利用电力，改装一个马达，便可推动这部打风机，还可省去使用锅炉的费用。曹万和的计划得到了领导方面的支持。厂里没有零件，他就到废铁堆里收集废料。很多零件都是经过好多次改装才配好的。经过他本人连续十多天的努力和组内工友的帮助，他到底把打风机改装成功了。
