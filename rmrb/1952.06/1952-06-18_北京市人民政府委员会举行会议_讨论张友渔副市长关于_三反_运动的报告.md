    Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee Holds Meeting
    To Discuss Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu's Report on the "Three-Anti" Movement
    [From Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its 15th meeting of the Second Session on the 13th to listen to and discuss the report by Vice Mayor and Deputy Director of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, Zhang Youyu, on the handling of the "Three-Anti" Movement.
    Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu first explained that the "Three-Anti" Movement in Beijing was in its final stages. He said: The main achievement of this movement is that it has universally and deeply educated all government staff, making them deeply resentful of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and increasing their awareness of cherishing state property. Regarding the handling of corrupt elements, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu said: Our handling of corrupt elements is carried out in accordance with the principle of "combining strictness with leniency; combining reform with punishment." The purpose of the "Three-Anti" Movement is mainly to cleanse the remaining toxins of the old society, further promote a clean, simple, and people-serving revolutionary work style, transform society, and establish a new atmosphere and new style, rather than simply punishing a few individuals. In the handling process, we must be realistic, clarify the facts, distinguish right from wrong, and act in accordance with policies and laws, preventing phenomena of being excessively harsh or lenient and hasty conclusions. In the handling of cases involving sentencing and exemption from punishment, the People's Courts of various units must not only go through the review of the superior temporary sub-courts, but also be approved by the joint office of the temporary sub-courts before a sentence can be pronounced. At present, the handling work of various units in Beijing has either basically ended or is in progress. By the end of this month, all cases in all units can basically be completed. In order to review whether there are any deviations in the handled cases, a review work is being arranged to various units recently, so as to ensure that no good person is wronged, nor a corrupt element is let go.
    Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu finally said: The "Three-Anti" Movement in Beijing has achieved great success. After the handling work is completed, it will enter the construction stage, establishing and reforming systems, improving work efficiency, and at the same time conducting necessary education among staff and corrupt elements to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement.
    Members of the Municipal People's Government, including Shu Sheyu, Le Songsheng, Zheng Yun, Wang Feiran, Lei Jieqiong, Xu Chubo, and Jiang Guangnai, spoke successively, unanimously believing that the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee's handling of corrupt elements was cautious, thorough, serious, and responsible. They also unanimously agreed that the handling policy was correct and expressed their support. In their speeches, the members also pointed out that the experience of the "People's Court" is worthy of attention, believing that the People's Court is convenient for concentrating the wisdom and strength of the masses, and everyone can play the role of prosecutor, judge, and defender. It has played a guarantee role in the handling of the "Three-Anti" Movement.

    北京市人民政府委员会举行会议
    讨论张友渔副市长关于“三反”运动的报告
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府委员会，在十三日举行第二届第十五次会议，听取并讨论副市长兼市节约检查委员会副主任张友渔关于“三反”运动处理情况的报告。
    张友渔副市长首先说明北京市的“三反”运动已处于结束阶段。他说：这次运动的主要收获，是普遍深入地教育了所有的机关工作人员，使他们对贪污、浪费、官僚主义深恶痛绝，增加了爱护国家财产的观念。关于贪污分子的处理情况，张友渔副市长说：我们处理贪污分子，是根据“严肃与宽大相结合；改造与惩治相结合”的方针进行的。“三反”运动的目的，主要是清洗旧社会遗留的污毒，进一步厉行廉洁的朴素的为人民服务的革命的工作作风，改造社会，树立新气象、新作风，而不是单纯的专为惩罚几个人。在处理过程中必须实事求是，搞清事实，辨明是非，根据政策法律办事，防止畸重畸轻和草率定案的现象。在处理判刑和免刑案件上，各单位人民法庭不仅要经过上级临时分庭的审查，而且还要经过各临时分庭联合办公的核准，才能宣判。目前北京市各单位的处理工作有的已经基本结束，有的正在处理，到本月底，所有各单位的案件基本上都可以处理完毕。为了审查已处理的案件有没有偏差，最近正向各单位布置复查工作，务期做到不冤枉一个好人，也不放过一个贪污分子。
    张友渔副市长最后说：北京市的“三反”运动已取得伟大的成绩，在处理工作结束后，就进入建设阶段，建立与改革制度，提高工作效率，同时在工作人员和贪污分子中进行必要的教育，以巩固“三反”运动的成绩。
    市人民政府委员舒舍予、乐松生、郑芸、王斐然、雷洁琼、徐楚波、蒋光鼐等相继发言，一致认为市人民政府和市节约检查委员会对贪污分子的处理是审慎、周密、严肃负责的；对处理方针也一致认为正确，表示拥护。各委员在发言中并指出“人民法庭”的经验是值得重视的，认为人民法庭便于集中群众的智慧和力量，人人都能起检察官、审判官和辩护人的作用。它对“三反”运动的处理工作，起了保证作用。
