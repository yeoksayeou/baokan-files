During this year's rainy season, the soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, carrying shovels, shoulder poles, and baskets, braved the rain and rushed from various defense positions to the forefront of national construction—the Jingjiang River Diversion Project—to undertake the construction of the new Huangtian Lake flood control levee project. When they arrived at the construction site, local farmers beat gongs, drums, and performed Yangko dances to welcome them from ten miles away.

The Huangtian Lake dangerous work section spans the southernmost end of the diversion area and is the concentration point of the flood's impact. The 5.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater in the diversion area rely on this new flood control levee to hold it back. Therefore, it is directly related to the safety of the areas around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province and the lower reaches of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers. It is an important project in the Jingjiang River Diversion Project. This project requires crossing the 450-meter-wide Huangtian Lake to build a flood control dam as high as twelve meters. The lake is deep and muddy, covered with obstacles such as water chestnuts and clam shells. The deepest point of the silt is four meters. The entire time from project measurement and design to completion is only three months. Therefore, this is a very difficult and urgent task.

However, for this battle-tested unit, which has produced heroic figures like Dong Cunrui and Guo Junqing, difficulties do not exist. Before construction started, the soldiers prepared by organizing their tools and studying methods. Encouraging slogans were posted everywhere in the barracks and on the construction site, such as "Step on Huangtian Lake, build the Jingjiang levee; after defeating the flood, victory upon victory!" "Sever Huangtian Lake, fight for the happiness of millions of people!" The silt in the lake was very deep. The original project design was to use explosives to blast open the gap and then fill it with sand, but the soldiers said, "No matter how difficult the mud is, it cannot stop our determination. For the sake of national construction, getting muddy is also glorious. Explosives should be saved for bombing the enemy!" Therefore, each company launched a competition to become a mud-digging hero company. The soldiers, one by one, bared their arms, regardless of the cold wind and rain, and jumped into the chest-deep mud, digging and carrying. When tools were lacking, some used their backs to carry it, and some dug with their hands. The mud was smelly and cold, and the water chestnuts and clam shells inside pierced the soldiers' feet and hands like steel needles and sharp knives. Fresh blood and silt solidified together, and their whole bodies shivered with cold, but the brave men still insisted on working. The battle cry of "Don't complain of heavy injuries, don't leave the firing line with minor injuries" also applies here. Sometimes, when there were too many injured people, the medics were too busy to cope, so the soldiers formed mutual aid groups, helping each other pick out thorns during breaks, freeing up the medics to take care of the more seriously injured comrades. The directly subordinate battalion and a certain detachment, responsible for digging the silt, dispatched more than 2,000 people, working in shifts day and night, regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy. The more arduous the work, the higher the soldiers' enthusiasm for labor. They sang and talked while working. One took the lead, and another continued. For example, Dong Ruijin, a soldier who had been in the same class as the famous combat hero Martyr Dong Cunrui and has now been promoted to deputy platoon leader of a certain company's first platoon, always encouraged everyone to overcome difficulties with combat spirit when he encountered difficulties in mud-digging. The louder the self-compiled quick-patter rhymes when it was raining and blowing strong winds: "Don't be afraid of the deep mud, we have confidence; the People's Liberation Army, wholeheartedly for the people; dig out all the mud and water, lay a good foundation for the levee; everyone, put in more effort, complete it ahead of schedule; glory in history, glory upon glory!" The heroic soldiers were using such a sense of honor and a happy mood to launch a fierce battle against the flood on Huangtian Lake to race against time.

The terrain of the Huangtian Lake construction site is low-lying. The water underground seeps out after digging less than one meter deep. In addition, during the Qingming Festival, the climate changes unpredictably, sometimes with several changes from sunny to rainy in one day. Under the attack of rainwater and lake water, they used the tactic of "large segmentation, small segmentation, eat one bite at a time" to fill a section of soil and consolidate a section of the levee foundation. In terms of labor organization, they used appropriate division of labor. First, they repaired the soil extraction road day and night, solving the difficulty of having many people and little land. They then dug countless drainage ditches in the central area to reduce groundwater. When shoveling soil, they used a imbricate method of digging large chunks, going deeper layer by layer, leaving no loose soil. In this way, loading and carrying soil was not only faster, but also avoided loose soil soaking in water and turning into mud. Work efficiency increased from the original 0.75 cubic meters of soil per person per day to more than three cubic meters.

The commanders and fighters on the construction site were working selflessly with a sense of honor for meritorious service to the people. Bai Jilima, the squad leader of the fourth squad of the fifth company of a certain unit, is a Communist Party member. His shoulder was worn out by the shoulder pole, but he still carried the soil while reciting quick-patter rhymes to encourage everyone. When the instructor asked him to rest, he said, "What is this minor injury? Compared with the hardships of the volunteer soldiers at the front, I am still enjoying myself. The volunteer soldiers have already made great contributions to the motherland, and I want to strive for meritorious service in this project!" With a high sense of responsibility and honor for their cause, they completed the drainage and silt removal task in just nine days and eight nights (four days ahead of the original plan), and within half a month, they completed more than 60% of the entire earthwork task for the levee construction project.

On the front line of national construction, the soldiers are advancing bravely to successfully complete their entire project.

    黄天湖上的英雄部队
    新华社记者　罗厚仁
    今年梅雨季节，人民解放军某部健儿们扛起洋锹、扁担、箩筐，从各个防地冒雨奔赴祖国建设前线——荆江分洪工地，担任修建黄天湖拦洪新堤工程。当他们抵达工地时，当地农民打起锣鼓、扭着秧歌到十里外来欢迎。
    黄天湖险工横跨在分洪区的最南端，是分洪区洪水撞击力的集中点，分洪区五十五亿立方公尺的洪水依靠这条拦洪新堤拦住，因此它直接关系着湖南省洞庭湖周围和湘、资、沅、澧四江下游两岸地区的安全，是荆江分洪工程中一个重要的工程。这一工程要跨过四百五十公尺宽的黄天湖，建筑一条高达十二公尺的拦洪大堤。湖里水深泥厚，遍布着菱角、蚌壳等阻碍物，淤泥最深处达四公尺，从工程测量设计到完成的全部时间只有三个月，因此这又是个非常艰巨而紧迫的任务。
    但是，对这支身经百战，出现过像董存瑞、郭俊卿那样的英雄人物的部队来说，困难是不存在的。开工前，战士们曾进行了整理工具，研究办法等准备工作。营房里、工地上到处贴着鼓舞人心的标语。如“脚踏黄天湖，手筑荆江堤；战胜洪水后，胜利加胜利！”“腰斩黄天湖，为千百万人民的幸福而斗争！”湖里的淤泥很深，原工程设计是用炸药炸开缺口后填沙，但战士们说：“不怕稀泥怎样困难，总阻挠不了我们的决心，为了祖国建设，沾身泥也是光荣的，炸药还要留着炸敌人哩！”于是各连纷纷发起竞赛，争取做掏泥英雄连。战士们一个个赤着胳膊，不顾寒风冷雨，跳进齐胸深的稀泥里，掏的掏，挑的挑，缺乏工具时，有的用背驮，有的用手挖。稀泥又臭又凉，里面的菱角、蚌壳像钢针、利刀一样刺破战士们的脚和手，鲜血和淤泥凝成一起，混身冷得发抖，但勇士们仍坚持着工作。“重伤不叫苦，轻伤不下火线”的战斗口号在这里也同样适用，有时受伤的人多，卫生员忙不过来，战士们就组成互助组，休息时互相帮助挑刺，腾出卫生员去照顾伤较重的同志。担任掏淤泥的直属大队和某支队等单位抽出了两千多人，不分晴天下雨，日夜轮班地工作着。工作越艰苦，战士们的劳动热情越高。他们一面工作，一面有说有唱，这个带头，那个就接下去。例如曾经与著名战斗英雄董存瑞烈士同班的战士，现已升任某中队一排副的董瑞金，他在掏泥中遇到困难时，总是鼓动大家，用战斗精神克服困难。越是在下雨刮大风的时候，他那自编的快板就唱得越响亮：“不怕稀泥深，我们有信心；人民解放军，全心为人民；掏尽泥和水，打好堤基根；大家加把劲，提前早完成；光荣历史上，光荣加光荣！”英勇的战士们，就是用这样的荣誉感和愉快的心情在黄天湖上与洪水展开了争夺时间的激烈斗争。
    黄天湖工地地势低洼，挖土不到一公尺深，地下的水就冒出来。加之在清明时节，气候变化无常，有时一天之内晴雨数变，在雨水和湖水夹攻下，他们用“大分割，小分割，吃一口，是一口”的战术，填一段土，巩固一段堤基。在劳动组合上，他们运用了适当分工，首先日夜轮班修好了取土大道，解决了人多地小的困难。他们接着在中心地带挖出无数条排水沟，以减少地下水。铲土时，他们用了鳞次式挖大块的办法，层层深入，不留碎土。这样，装土、挑土既快，又可避免碎土浸水变成稀泥，工作效率由原来每人每天挖零点七五立方土提高到三立方以上。
    工地上的指挥员战斗员们怀着为人民立功的荣誉心情，忘我地劳动着。某部五中队四班长白吉力马，他是个共产党员，他的肩被扁担磨烂了一块，他还是一面担土，一面说快板鼓动大家。指导员要他休息，他说：“这点轻伤算什么，比起前线志愿军的艰苦来还是享福。志愿军已经为祖国立了大功，我要在这次工程中争取立功！”怀着对自己的事业的高度责任感与荣誉感，他们仅以九天八夜的时间（较原计划提前四天），完成了排水清淤任务，又在半个月内，完成了筑堤工程全部土方任务的百分之六十以上。
    在祖国建设前线上，战士们正为胜利地完成自己的全部工程而奋勇前进。
