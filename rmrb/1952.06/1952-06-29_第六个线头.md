The battle was raging fiercely, and the telephone in the volunteer army's command post kept ringing.

It was March 23, 1951. The enemy, venturing north, was attempting to outflank the Third Battalion with small units. The commander of the unit was listening to a report on the battle situation from the Third Battalion over the phone. Suddenly, the phone went dead. A burst of artillery fire came from a gully between the command post and the Third Battalion. The telephone line was laid right through there.

The gully was under enemy fire, and the telephone line had been broken more than once. Zhang Fude, a telephone operator from the Eighth Squad of the reconnaissance company, was responsible for traveling back and forth along the route to check the line. He had just returned from checking the line on the way to the Third Battalion when the line was broken again. He had to set out immediately to reconnect it.

Zhang Fude followed the line, his eyes fixed on the rising and falling wire, walking cautiously and quickly. Where there were artillery explosions, that was where he needed to go. Shells were constantly falling around him. He had just connected the first wire end when the wire in front was broken into several sections. He managed to crawl over and connect them, but a fire started behind him, so he had to crawl back to raise the wire. His right hand had been injured a few days earlier while digging fortifications, and the broken skin had become infected. He used a cloth to sling the injured hand around his neck, feeling a dull ache, but he stubbornly persisted in his work.

The broken lines in the section with the densest enemy fire had been repaired, and the line was broken again 200 meters from the battalion headquarters. This was the last wire end to be connected – the sixth wire end. Once this was connected, the entire line would be open.

Just as Zhang Fude picked up the broken wire ends with both hands, the enemy's machine guns opened fire on him. Suddenly, a bullet pierced his right leg, entered his left leg, and injured his testicles. He fell into a pool of blood, but his hands still held the broken wire ends tightly. He knew his injuries were severe, but he thought, "This overseas operation is for the motherland, for the Korean people, for the cause of world peace. I am a party member, and I must complete my mission no matter what!" A great and resolute fighting will supported him. He painfully and laboriously used his teeth to bite off the outer layer of the wire ends, and his hands trembled as he connected the wires, holding the joint of the broken ends to check whether the entire line was clear. After a while, he felt a tingling in his hands, knowing that the current was flowing through the line. A smile of victory appeared on his pale face, but the intense pain from his wounds left him with no strength to crawl to the battalion headquarters.

Two hours later, he was discovered by his comrades and carried back. All the comrades in the squad came to express their condolences. He calmly said to everyone, "It is an honor to shed blood to complete the mission. As long as it is worthwhile, sacrifice doesn't matter." Because of this strong will and spirit of self-sacrifice, as well as his consistently positive and hardworking attitude in his work, the Party Committee of the unit has approved him as a model telephone operator for the entire company.

    第六个线头
    蔚生
    战斗在激烈地进行着，志愿军某部指挥所的电话机响个不停。
    这是一九五一年三月二十三日，冒险北犯的敌人，以小股部队向三营迂回。该部首长正从电话中听取三营关于战斗情况的报告。突然，电话中断了。由指挥所通往三营的一条山沟里，传来一阵炮弹爆炸的巨响。电话总机的线路正是敷设在那里的。
    这条山沟已经被敌人火力封锁了，电话线不只一次地被打断，侦察连八班电话员张付德负责往返在这条路上查线。他刚由去三营的路上查通了线回来，现在电话线又断了，他又得立即出发去接线。
    张付德顺着线路，两眼盯着电线一起一伏地机警地疾步前进，那里有炮弹爆炸，那里便是他要去的地方。炮弹不时地落到他的周围，他刚接好第一个线头，前面电线又被打断了几节，好容易爬过去接好了，背后面又起了火，又得爬回去把线架高起来。他的右手，在前几天挖工事时被震伤了，破皮了的地方已经化脓，他用布把这只负伤的手吊在脖子上，有些隐隐发痛，但他仍顽强地坚持工作。
    敌人弹着点最密集的一段地带的断线都接好了，距营部二百米达处的线又被炸断了。这是最后要结的一个线头——第六个线头。这里一接好，线路就全通了。
    张付德两手刚拾起断线头，敌人的机枪便朝他打来。突然，一颗子弹穿透了他的右腿，打进左腿，睪丸也被打伤了，顿时，他倒在血泊里了，但两手仍紧紧地捏着断线头。他知道自己的伤很重，可是，他想：“这次出国作战是为了祖国，是为朝鲜人民，是为全世界的和平事业，我是个党员，无论如何得完成任务！”一种伟大而坚决的战斗意志支持着他，他痛苦而又艰难地用牙咬去线头上的外皮，两手颤抖地把电线接好，并且捏着断头的接合部，借以检查是否全线畅通无阻。一会儿他手上感到一阵麻木，知道电流在线路上通了，他苍白的脸上，浮现着胜利的笑容，可是伤口的剧痛使他再也没有力量爬到营部了。
    两个钟头后，他被同志们发觉抬了回来。全班同志都来慰问，他从容地向大家说：“为完成任务流血是光荣的，只要有价值，牺牲也算不了什么。”正因为这种坚强的意志和自我牺牲的精神，以及平时工作一贯积极、苦干，该部党委已批准他为全连的模范电话员。苗地插图（附图片）
