    New Relationships Among Han, Mongolian, and Uyghur Peoples in Jiuquan Prefecture, Gansu
    Comrade Editor: In Jiuquan Prefecture, Gansu Province, live people of Han, Mongolian, and Uyghur ethnicities. Since the land reform, a new atmosphere of unprecedented unity and mutual assistance has emerged among the various fraternal ethnic groups. In the fifth township of the third district of Dunhuang, ten Mongolian households and eight Uyghur households were allocated land but did not know how to cultivate it. The Han people in the village took the initiative to help them. The Han people even competed with each other to see who could help the fraternal ethnic groups cultivate better. During the land reform in the third district of Anxi County, twenty-one Mongolian households moved to agricultural areas and converted to agricultural production. They were warmly welcomed by the local Han farmers. After the land was distributed, the Mongolian and Han people jointly formulated production plans and organized mutual aid teams of Mongolian and Han people. All the Han members of the teams guaranteed to teach the Mongolian people how to farm. The mutual aid teams helped the Mongolian people plow 55 mu of land and planted 130 mu of crops. By April 22, the Mongolian people had planted wheat, highland barley, and beans. With the brotherly help of the Han people, the Mongolian people were deeply moved and their confidence in production was greatly enhanced. Mongolian people Cui Tianxi and Ma Banding said, "There is a shortage of manure here. This year, we will drive the livestock into the pens to produce more manure and help the Han people transport the manure as well, striving to harvest more grain." Now, the summer fields of the Uyghur and Mongolian peoples in various parts of Jiuquan Prefecture have been planted. The fraternal ethnic groups are not only enthusiastic about production, but also actively participate in learning.
    Here, the new relationship of close unity, mutual love, and mutual assistance among the various ethnic groups is developing and consolidating day by day. Ling Ming

    甘肃酒泉专区汉、蒙、维各族人民的新关系
    编辑同志：甘肃省酒泉专区住着汉、蒙、维等民族的人民。土地改革以后，各兄弟民族之间，呈现着空前团结互助的新气象。在敦煌三区五乡住着的十户蒙族同胞、八户维族同胞，分到了田地，但不会耕种，村中的汉民就主动地帮助他们。汉民并且互相比赛，看谁帮助兄弟民族种得更好。在安西县三区进行土地改革的时候，有二十一户蒙民搬到农业区，转入农业生产。他们受到当地汉族农民的热烈欢迎。土地分配好以后，蒙汉人民在一起订出了生产计划，组织起蒙汉人民的互助组，全体汉民组员都保证要教会蒙民种地。互助组帮助蒙民犁了五十五亩地，种了一百三十亩地的庄稼，到四月二十二日，蒙民的小麦、青稞、豆子都已种上了。蒙民在汉民兄弟般的帮助下，十分感动，生产信心大大地提高了。蒙民崔天喜、马班丁说：“这里粪很缺，今年我们要把牲口赶到圈里，多造些粪，帮助汉民把粪也拉上，争取多打粮食。”现在，酒泉专区各地维族、蒙族的夏田都已经种上了。兄弟民族不但生产情绪高涨，也积极地参加了学习。
    在这里，各族亲密团结、友爱互助的新关系，正日益发展巩固着。凌明
