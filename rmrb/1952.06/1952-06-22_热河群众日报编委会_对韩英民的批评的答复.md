Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

To the Editorial Department:

The reader's letter published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 21, which criticized our mass work and reporting on the "Three-Anti" movement, is correct. We sincerely accept this criticism and are determined to correct it.

After we received Comrade Han Yingmin's manuscript, it was given to editor Wang Feng for processing. Later, Wang Feng went to the countryside for interviews and mistakenly took the manuscript to Chaoyang. When Comrade Han Yingmin inquired about the manuscript, we sent a telegram to Wang Feng and Comrade Shen Yukuo, the agency director, also admitted the mistake to Minister Li of the Rehe Military Department. Later, the manuscript was lost by Wang Feng but was found by the Chaoyang County Party Committee, and then transferred to the Provincial Thrift Inspection Committee, which forwarded it to the newspaper and it was published on February 20 after being organized. This incident shows that the editors do not pay enough attention to readers' contributions. After leading comrades give manuscripts to editors, they should promptly inquire about the results. Editors should also handle manuscripts with a responsible attitude and should not take them to the countryside at will, let alone lose them. As for the "Three-Anti" reporting, in addition to the errors exposed by Comrade Han Yingmin, we also found many errors. For example, the cartoon published on February 21 blurred the essence of the unlawful bourgeois elements attacking the working class, and the news "Comrade Shao Shizuo Refuses Bribes" published on February 13 was untrue. In order to improve our work, we made a public self-criticism on the newspaper on March 26 and solicited opinions from the readers, asking them to help the newspaper to check its work. At the same time, we held meetings of the editorial board and the editorial staff to combine the summary of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" reports with the ideological and work situation for examination, and criticized the erroneous thinking of not paying attention to mass work. Finally, according to more than fifty readers' letters and the problems found in the inspection work, we put forward a concrete plan to strengthen mass work. This is the simple process of how we accepted criticism and improved our work.

### 热河群众日报编委会  对韩英民的批评的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    热河群众日报编委会
    对韩英民的批评的答复
    编辑同志：三月二十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的读者来信，对我们的群众工作和关于“三反”运动的报道提出批评，这一批评是正确的。我们诚恳地接受，并决心改正。
    当我们接到韩英民同志的来稿以后，就交给编辑王风同志处理。后来王风同志下乡采访，误把该稿带到朝阳。韩英民同志追询此稿时，我们就打电报问王风同志，同时沈毓珂社长也向热河军事部李部长承认错误。后来该稿被王风同志丢失，由朝阳县委拾得，后经省节约检查委员会转给报社，于二月二十日整理发表。从这个事件中，可以看出编辑人员对读者的来稿是不重视的。领导同志既然交给编辑稿件，就应及时追问处理结果。编辑也应以负责的精神处理来稿，不应擅自带到乡下，更不应丢失。至于“三反”报道问题，除韩英民同志揭发的错误外，我们还发现有不少的错误。如二月二十一日发表的漫画就模糊了不法资产阶级分子向工人阶级进攻的本质，二月十三日发表的“邵世佐同志拒绝贿赂”消息是不真实的。我们为了改进工作，对这件事一面在三月二十六日的报纸上作了公开检讨，并征求广大读者意见，请读者协助本报检查工作；一面先后召开了编委会与编辑部人员的会议，结合总结“三反”“五反”报道和思想、工作状况，进行检查，批判了不重视群众工作的错误思想。最后，我们根据五十多件读者来信和在检查工作中所发现的问题，提出加强群众工作的具体方案。这就是我们接受批评改进工作的简单经过。
