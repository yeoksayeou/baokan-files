    Beijing's Miracle This Summer
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Shen Rong
    In past summers, on Beijing's tree-lined streets, swarms of insects could be seen flying around every street lamp. But this year, every street lamp seems particularly bright, and those insects that used to circle the lights have disappeared. I remember that two years ago at this time, many citizens had already hung up mosquito nets, but this year many have not even taken them out. There are significantly fewer flies this year. This is something everyone has noticed.
    Anyone with some public health knowledge will know what a remarkable miracle this is. For example, in the summer, each pair of flies can reproduce up to two hundred offspring in ten days, and after a season, their descendants would exceed the population of the entire world. According to the general principles of public health, eliminating flies and mosquitoes requires highly industrialized conditions, such as perfect modern sewage systems, flush toilets in every household, and sufficient medicines, equipment, and other necessities. Currently, the number of households in Beijing using flush toilets accounts for only one percent of the total number of households. Even with the astonishing speed of progress in New China, it would still take one or two decades to fully achieve these conditions.
    Yan Jingqing, the Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, is a public health expert. He told me an interesting story: Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Beijing had a mayor named Zhou Dawen. He felt that the number of flies was so disruptive that he specifically sought out several health experts to discuss the matter. The many stringent conditions required to eliminate flies greatly surprised the mayor, and he abandoned the idea from then on.
    Eliminating flies in individual residences with sewage systems and flush toilets is not too difficult. But today, eliminating flies is being done throughout the entire city of Beijing, with a particular focus on areas where the working people live. Two weeks ago, Deputy Mayor Wu Han personally inspected the hygiene of the four main vegetable markets in the city and did not find a single fly. Perhaps these markets had made temporary preparations, but if there were originally a lot of flies, it would have been impossible to eliminate them so completely with temporary swatting. The open-air vegetable market on Chaoyangmen Street used to be the dirtiest of these four markets, but this year it has become a model of cleanliness. When reporters visited there on June 20th, they found a total of fewer than ten flies. I saw one fly at a vegetable stall. There were two or three at a fish stall. But there were none at the meat stalls. You can also casually visit any small restaurant or fruit stand and get the same surprising impression.
    All the manure drying fields outside the city walls are now beginning to be relocated. Before the relocation, reporters visited several manure fields outside Fuxingmen and Longwangmiao. Workers at the manure drying fields told me that in the past, as soon as summer arrived, the corn buns they ate would turn black, meaning they were constantly covered in flies. This situation has completely changed this year. I stayed in several manure fields for a total of three hours and did not see swarms of flies.
    How was this miracle achieved? The People's Government has made many arduous efforts in sanitation projects, but we will not discuss that for the moment. On the other hand, the people of Beijing have launched a mass patriotic health campaign. People from all walks of life are actively sweeping away garbage, swatting flies, catching rats, and overturning pots and jars, and plugging tree holes to eliminate mosquito larvae. One of the keys to eliminating flies lies in eliminating fly pupae. Beijingers call fly pupae "Kongfu." From mid-March to June 8th, according to incomplete statistics, more than 400 million "Kongfu" were dug up throughout the city. If they were allowed to develop and reproduce, they would reach astronomical figures in just a few short weeks. These "Kongfu" were dug up from the edges of cesspools and under the walls of every household. If the masses were not mobilized, could such a huge achievement be reached, even if the government hired ten thousand workers to specifically do this work?
    The power of the people is incomparable. The heart of the matter is here. In this movement, the staff of all organizations and groups were fully mobilized to conduct thorough cleanups. In addition to completing school sanitation work, many students also went outside the school to carry out this work. The workers at the Longwangmiao manure drying field told me that every Sunday, large numbers of students came there to dig up "Kongfu" and swat flies. The working people and general residents are especially the main force of this movement. Their enthusiasm for these tasks surpasses that of everyone else. Up until now, competitions have been launched between streets and streets, and between industries and industries, and mutual inspections are carried out. If any household still has unused pots and jars left open in the courtyard, this household and its region will be very dishonored, because such open pots and jars easily accumulate water and breed mosquitoes. In the small alleyways, we can sometimes encounter people walking past carrying rats. They are going to the head of the hygiene team. The number of rats caught is also one of the competition items. From mid-April to June 8th, more than 450,000 rats have been caught throughout the city. When a plague occurred in Chahar in 1949, Beijing also launched a patriotic health campaign, at that time less than 50,000 rats were caught in total. The level of awareness and organization of the masses has greatly improved in the past three years. In all of these tasks, people have used all their ingenuity and created various methods. Every effective method has been quickly disseminated throughout the city through congresses, small meetings, exhibitions, quick reports, and wall newspapers, etc. Thus, the most significant effect is: diseases have been greatly reduced. The number of people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases this year is much smaller than last year. For example, from January to April, the number of deaths due to typhoid fever was only 58 percent of the same period last year, the number of deaths due to dysentery was only 28 percent of the same period last year, and the number of deaths due to other gastrointestinal diseases was only 64 percent of the same period last year.
    Under the leadership of the People's Government, the masses of the people are creating miracles with their own hands. Beijing's patriotic health campaign has once again demonstrated the superiority of the new democratic system. This summer, the masses of the people of Beijing have created a miracle.

### 北京今夏的奇迹

    北京今夏的奇迹
    新华社记者  沈容
    往年夏夜，在树木茂盛的北京街道上到处看得到成群的虫子飞扑着每一盏街灯。然而今年，每一盏街灯都显得特别明亮，那些萦绕着灯光的虫子都不见了。记得前两年这时候许多市民已经挂上了蚊帐，而今年许多市民还没有把蚊帐拿出来。今年的苍蝇大大减少了。这尤其是每一个人都已经注意到的。
    懂得一些公共卫生知识的人会知道这是一个多么了不起的奇迹。比如说，夏季每一对苍蝇十天内就能繁殖到两百只，经过一季的工夫，它们的子孙就会超过全世界人口的数目。按照公共卫生的一般原理，要消灭苍蝇蚊虫之类，必须具备高度工业化的条件，这就是完善的近代化下水道，每一家人家都装置着抽水马桶，以及充分的药械和其他。现在北京使用抽水马桶的户数，仅占总户数的百分之一，就是按新中国前进的惊人速度，这些条件也要一二十年以后才能全部具备。
    北京市公共卫生局局长严镜清是一位公共卫生专家，他给我讲了一个有趣的故事：抗日战争前，北京有一个叫周大文的市长。他觉得苍蝇之多，实在扰乱了他，特地找了几个卫生专家去商量。消灭苍蝇需要那样许多苛刻的条件，使这位市长老爷大吃一惊，从此他就把这个念头打消了。
    要是在拥有下水道和抽水马桶的个别住宅里消灭苍蝇，还不是太困难的事情。但是今天，消灭苍蝇是以全北京市为对象，特别是以劳动人民聚居的地区为重点的。两星期以前，副市长吴晗亲自检查了市内四个主要菜市场的卫生情况，而竟没有发现一个苍蝇。可能是这些市场临时做了准备，但是如果苍蝇本来就很多，临时扑打绝不可能消灭得这样干净。朝阳门大街的露天菜市曾经是这四个菜市中最肮脏的一个，今年成了清洁的模范。记者六月二十日到那里去参观，发现的苍蝇总共不到十个。在一家蔬菜摊上我看见了一个苍蝇。一家鱼摊上有两、三个。而肉摊上竟一个也没有。你还可以随便到那家小饭馆或者水果摊上去看看，都可以得到这样叫人惊奇的印象。
    城墙外面的全部晒粪场现在正在开始迁移。记者在迁移之前曾到复兴门外和龙王庙的几个粪场去参观。晒粪的工人同志告诉我，从前一到夏天，他们吃的窝窝头就变成了黑的，就是说，随时都被苍蝇爬满了。这种情形在今年完全改变了。我在几个粪场中总共逗留了三小时，已经看不到成群的苍蝇了。
    这奇迹是怎样得来的呢？人民政府在卫生工程方面做了许多艰巨的努力，这方面我们暂且不去说它。另一方面，北京人民展开了一个群众性的防疫卫生运动，各阶层人民积极地扫除垃圾，扑打苍蝇，捕捉老鼠和翻盆倒罐，堵树洞，以消灭孑孓。灭蝇的关键之一，在于消灭蝇蛹，北京人把蝇蛹叫做“金刚”。这次从三月中旬到六月八日，全市挖掉的“金刚”据不完全统计就有四亿多个。如果让它们发育和繁殖起来，只要短短几个星期的工夫就会达到天文学上那样惊人的数字。这些“金刚”是从每一家人家的粪坑边和墙脚下挖出来的，如果不发动群众，比如说由政府雇用一万个工人专门做这些工作，难道可能达到这样巨大的成绩吗？
    人民群众的力量是无可比拟的，问题的中心正在这里。在这个运动中，各机关团体的工作人员全体动员举行了大扫除。学生们除了完成学校的卫生工作之外，很多人还跑到校外进行这个工作。龙王庙晒粪场的工人同志告诉我，每到星期天，就有大批学生到那里去挖“金刚”和打苍蝇。劳动人民和一般居民尤其是这个运动的主力。他们对这些工作的积极性超过了所有其他的人。一直到现在，街道和街道之间、行业和行业之间都展开着竞赛，并进行着相互检查，如果那一家还有不用的盆盆罐罐敞口放在院子里，这家人家和他所属的地区就会很不光彩，因为盆盆罐罐这样随便敞口放着是很容易因积水而滋生蚊虫的。在小胡同里我们有时也可以碰到提着老鼠走过的人。他们是到卫生小组长那里去的。捕鼠多少也是竞赛的项目之一。从四月中旬到六月八日，全市捕捉的老鼠已有四十五万多只。一九四九年察哈尔发生鼠疫的时候，北京市也曾发动了一次防疫卫生运动，那时捉到的老鼠总共不到五万只。三年来人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度都大大提高了。在所有这些工作中，人们用尽心机，创造了各种各样的办法。每一项有效的办法都被迅速地用大会、小会、展览会、快报和墙报等等方式传播全城。这样，最显著的效果是：疾病大大减少了。今年患肠胃病的人数比去年少得多。比如一月到四月，因伤寒而死亡的人数只有去年同期的百分之五十八，患痢疾而死亡的仅有去年同期的百分之二十八，患其他肠胃病而死亡的只相当于去年同期的百分之六十四。
    在人民政府领导下，人民群众亲手创造着奇迹。北京市的防疫卫生运动又一次说明了新民主主义制度的优越性。今年的夏天，北京人民群众创造了奇迹。
