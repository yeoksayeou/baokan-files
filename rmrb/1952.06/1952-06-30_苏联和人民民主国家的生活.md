    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Nearly 600,000 Soviet high school and university graduates will be employed or continue their studies this year
    With the arrival of summer vacation, broad opportunities for employment and higher education are opening up for high school and university graduates in the Soviet Union. This year, 220,000 young people will graduate from universities in the Soviet Union, and 370,000 young people will advance from secondary schools to universities. This is a new record in the history of the Soviet Union for the number of university graduates and new student enrollment.
    Due to the rapid development of the Soviet socialist economy and culture, the demand for and training of cadres and technical personnel in various work sectors are increasing day by day. This year, more than 30,000 Soviet university graduates will begin working in industrial sectors such as machinery, metallurgy, water conservancy, mining, machine manufacturing, and railway and inland water transportation; 15,000 young people will participate in the agricultural mechanization work of collective farms, state farms, and tractor stations; 70,000 young teachers will begin teaching the next generation in the new school year; and tens of thousands of young people will become doctors and workers in economics, law, culture, and the arts.
    Last year, the Soviet Union had 887 universities, and this year it will increase to more than 900, with a capacity of more than 1.4 million students. Currently, in more than 50 cities in the central states, Siberia, the Urals, Central Asia, the Baltic region, the Caucasus, and various autonomous republics of the Soviet Union, many new university buildings are under construction, all of which are large-scale constructions. This year, many new departments will be further added to universities and research institutes. Special attention is being paid to the training of experts in geology, mining and metallurgy, electricity, soil improvement, and hydraulic engineering. Universities will cultivate more talent for the great communist construction projects.
Romania and Hungary sign long-term economic cooperation agreement
    The governments of Romania and Hungary recently signed a long-term economic cooperation agreement in Bucharest. According to this agreement, the two parties will establish a mixed chemical association to build a gas chemical plant in Romania. The two countries will jointly lay a gas pipeline to transport natural gas from Romania to a chemical plant to be built in Hungary. This gas pipeline will also supply natural gas to several regions of Romania.
    The agreement stipulates the erection of a high-voltage power line for the common use of the two countries, so that the two countries can use power sources more rationally.
    Hungary will supply Romania with machinery and equipment for the sodium carbonate chemical industry, and the products of this industry will be supplied for use by both countries.
    This economic cooperation agreement, concluded between the two brotherly countries on the basis of mutual assistance and complete equality, will promote the socialist industrialization of the two countries, help meet the important economic needs of both parties, and promote the prosperity of Romania and Hungary.
Bulgaria is building a large metallurgical plant
    Near the "Dimitrov" coal mining area in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian people are building Bulgaria's first and largest metallurgical plant.
    Because the construction of this factory has a great effect on Bulgaria's economic construction, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers issued a decision on April 25 to accelerate the construction of the factory, so that it can be put into trial operation in mid-1953. Striving to complete the construction of this factory ahead of schedule has become a major task for the people of Bulgaria.
    Currently, many workshops of the factory have been completed, and the factory building for manufacturing refractory bricks and the machine repair shop are also nearing completion. The factory's administrative building, health station, laboratory, and workers' residences will be completed in two or three months. Various machines transported from the Soviet Union have begun to be installed in many new workshops.
    The groundbreaking work for the main production workshops, such as steelmaking furnaces and iron rolling production workshops, is underway. Powerful excavators—each capable of replacing nearly a hundred people's labor—are busy on the site. Light railways for transporting building materials have also been laid.
    When this factory is completed and put into production, Bulgaria will no longer have to import non-ferrous metals from abroad and will be able to be self-sufficient.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    苏联今年有近六十万名大、中学毕业生就业和升学
    随着暑假的来临，在苏联大、中学毕业生的面前展开了就业和受高等教育的广泛机会。今年苏联将有二十二万名青年从高等学校毕业，有三十七万名青年从中学升入高等学校。这是苏联历年来大学毕业生与新生入学人数的新纪录。
    由于苏联社会主义经济和文化的迅速发展，各个工作部门对于干部和技术人员的需求和训练正在日益扩大。今年苏联的大学毕业生将有三万多人开始在机械、冶金、水利、采矿、机器制造、铁路和内河运输等工业部门担任工作；一万五千名青年将参加集体农场、国家农场和拖拉机站的农业机械化的工作；七万名青年教师将在今年的新学年中开始担任教育下一代的工作；成千成万的青年将来成为医师和经济、法律、文化、艺术工作者。
    苏联去年有八百八十七所高等学校，今年将增加到九百多所，可容纳学生一百四十多万名。现在，苏联中央各州、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、中亚细亚、波罗的海区、高加索和各自治共和国的五十多个城市中，正在建筑许多高等学校的新校舍，这些校舍都是大规模的建筑。今年各大学和研究所中将进一步增设许多新科系。训练地质、矿冶、电力、土壤改良和水力工程等专家的工作受到特别的重视。各高等学校将为伟大共产主义建设工程造就更多的人材。罗匈签订长期经济合作协定
    罗马尼亚和匈牙利两国政府最近在布加勒斯特签订了一个长期经济合作协定。根据这一协定，双方成立一个混合化学协会，在罗马尼亚建立一个煤气化学工厂。两国将经由共同的努力敷设一条煤气管，把罗马尼亚的天然煤气输往将在匈牙利建立的一个化学工厂。这条煤气管同时也将以天然煤气供给罗马尼亚若干地区。
    协定中规定架设一条两国公用的高压电线，使两国可能更合理地使用动力的源泉。
    匈牙利将以炭酸钠化学工业的机器和设备供给罗马尼亚，这项工业的产品则供给两国使用。
    这两个兄弟国家在互助与完全平等的基础上缔结的这个经济合作协定，将推进两国的社会主义工业化，帮助满足双方重要的经济要求，并促进罗匈两国的繁荣。保加利亚兴建大冶金工厂
    在保加利亚“季米特洛夫”煤矿区附近，保加利亚人民正在建设保加利亚第一所最大的冶金工厂。
    因为兴建这个工厂对于保加利亚的经济建设有着很大的作用，所以保加利亚共产党和部长会议曾在四月二十五日发布决定，加速该厂的建设，以便能在一九五三年中试行开工。争取提前完成兴建这个工厂的工作，已经成为保加利亚全国人民的重大任务。
    现在这个工厂的许多车间已经建成，制造耐火砖的厂房和机器修理厂也已接近完成。工厂的行政大厦、保健站、实验室和工人的住宅将在二、三个月内完成全部工程。从苏联运来的各种机器已在许多新的车间内开始安装。
    主要的生产车间，如炼钢炉和辗铁生产车间的奠基工作正在进行。强大有力的挖掘机——每一架能代替近百人的劳动力——正在现场上忙碌着。输送建筑材料的轻便铁道也已铺设起来。
    当这个工厂兴建完成而开始生产以后，保加利亚就可以不再由国外输入有色金属而能自给自足了。
