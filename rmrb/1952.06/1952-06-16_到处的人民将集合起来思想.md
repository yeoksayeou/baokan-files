    People Everywhere Will Come Together to Think
    New Zealand Louis Ayly walked through the courtyard, the paving stones worn smooth by the footsteps of countless generations, across bridges with jade railings, where green trees rustled, summer breezes whispered, and glazed tiles shimmered with gold, interwoven with the deep red color of the palace walls, forming a picture of serene solemnity. As we walked, we listened to these conversations: "Yes, at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century, the Allied forces of Western countries invaded; they burned, killed, and looted; our library, ancient historical records, the Yuanmingyuan Palace, and other cultural relics were destroyed; our people wanted peaceful lives, but at that time, opium was too profitable!" Among us were a Ceylonese man in yellow robes, several Indians, Australians, Americans, Burmese, Japanese, a New Zealander, a Soviet writer, a Chinese mass leader, and several other people from the Asian and Pacific regions. We came together in the new Beijing, which had once been plundered by invading armies but had now become the people's capital. We gathered here to discuss the simplest thing: peaceful coexistence between people. "More than eighty bronzes were originally displayed here, but they were all snatched away by the Japanese 'Imperial Army' to make munitions to slaughter our people. Yes, there are still many precious antiquities here, but Kuomintang officials sold them, exchanging the relics of our ancestors for pounds and dollars. Our people's tolerance has reached its limit." Finally, we entered a quiet courtyard. We slowly walked up the steps into a silent hall. How beautiful the exterior of the house was, but inside it was stark, a reality beyond imagination! Here, Western countries, the United Nations, and Western civilization were all put on trial. Here, countless pieces of evidence, bit by bit, piece by piece, were gathered together, the terrible devaluation of human beings, the ultimate disgrace—the treacherous plot to carry out large-scale massacres with bacteria, was nakedly displayed before our eyes. A primary school student from Kuandian County told us that in a snow-covered field, he and his friends found many bomb fragments, piles and piles of feathers infected with bacteria. Others sent cardboard bombs, dropped by parachute. There were also long steel bombs with compartments, which would split open when they fell and then spread death. All of this was done by things that were once called humans,
        but have now fallen to such a state! The rogue newspapers of Western countries stood before their own accusers, listening to these shocking and conclusive accusations. The evidence here shows that everything was fully prepared in advance, everything was carefully designed, diseased fish and frogs, crows and rats… Watching such an America, we felt extremely ashamed. In front of the new people, she had fallen so despicable! She defeated herself, poisoned herself, she transformed herself into a plague! The scientist who explained all this to us projected a stern gaze from his eyes, paused for a moment, as if he said to himself, "We will never forget." An Indian peace warrior, holding his head high, spat out a word contemptuously: "Idiots!" Their words will spread everywhere, and ordinary people everywhere will come together to think, echoing the same sentiment.
          Beijing, May 30th.

    到处的人民将集合起来思想
    新西兰  路易·艾黎穿过院子，那些铺地的巨石已经被无数世代的脚步所磨损，走过那些玉石栏杆的桥，绿树婆娑，夏季的和风低唱，琉璃瓦闪着金光，和那宫墙的深红的颜色交织成一幅沉静庄严的图画。我们一边走着，一边倾听这些谈话：“是的，在上世纪的末尾，和这个世纪的开头，侵入了西方国家的联军；他们烧杀掳掠，我们的藏书，古代的史籍，圆明园的宫殿和其他文物，都遭到了毁灭；我国人民希望和平的生活，但是，那时候，鸦片烟太赚钱！”我们之中有一个穿黄袍的锡兰人，还有几个印度人，澳洲人，美洲人，缅甸人，日本人，新西兰人，一个苏联作家，一个中国的群众领袖，还有几个其他的亚洲的和太平洋区域的人，我们一起来到了新的北京，这儿曾经遭受过侵略军的劫掠，现在却变成了人民的首都，我们集合在这儿，交谈着一件最单纯的事情，就是人与人的和平共处。“在这儿原来陈列着八十多个青铜器，但是都被日本“皇军”抢走，去造了军火，来屠杀我国人民。是的，这儿还有许多珍贵古物，但是国民党官僚们把它们卖了，把祖先的遗物去换英镑美金，我们人民的容忍已经到了尽头。”最后我们走进一个静悄悄的院子，我们慢慢地走上台阶，进入一间沉默的厅堂，屋子外表是多么美丽，里面却是赤裸裸的，超乎想像的现实！在这儿，西方国家，联合国，以及西方文明，一齐受到了审讯。在这儿，无数证据，点点滴滴，一片一片，集合拢来，人的可怕的贬值，绝顶的耻辱——企图用细菌进行大规模屠杀的奸计，赤裸裸地展示在我们眼前。宽甸县的一个小学生告诉我们，在一片积雪的田野里，他和小朋友们发现了许多炸弹裂片，一堆，一堆染有毒菌的羽毛。还有从别的人送来了硬纸做的炸弹，那是用降落伞投掷的。还有长形的钢质的有隔板的炸弹，落下的时候会裂开，然后撒布死亡，这都是一些曾经叫做人的东西干的，
        现在堕落到这般田地！西方国家的无赖的报纸站在他们本国的指控人之前，听这些惊人的证据确凿的控诉。这里的证据表示出，一切都是经过事前充分准备的，一切都是经过深思熟虑地设计的，染过病菌的鱼和蛙，乌鸦和老鼠……我们眼看着这样一个美国，感到了极度的可耻，她在新的人民的面前，已经堕落得如此卑鄙！她击败了自己，毒化了自己，她把自己化为瘟疫！那位给我们讲解的科学家从他的眼睛里投射出严峻的目光，停了一会，他好像对他自己说道，“我们永远不会忘记。”一个印度的和平战士，高昂着头，轻蔑地吐出一个字：“蠢货！”他们的话将要传遍每一个地方，到处的普通人民将要集合起来一起思想，发出同样的回响。
          北京，五月三十日。
