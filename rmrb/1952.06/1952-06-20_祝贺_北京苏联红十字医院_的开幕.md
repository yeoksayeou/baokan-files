    Congratulations on the Opening of the "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital"
    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China

    The "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital" has opened in our great capital, Beijing. This is of great significance in the cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union. It is a concrete practice of cooperation between the Red Cross Society of China and the Red Cross Society of the Soviet Union, based on the common ideals of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism.

    In China's history of nearly a century, there have been many instances of foreigners coming to China to set up hospitals. With the liberation of the motherland and the increasing awareness of the people, those conspiracies that used "charity" and "aid" as a guise to carry out aggression have been thoroughly exposed, and those imperialist aggressors have been driven out. After their cloaks of "charity" and "aid" were stripped away, their original hideous faces were nakedly revealed. The bombing of Northeast China by American imperialism, and the recent expansion of germ warfare to Northeast China, are the best illustrations. In contrast, the great fraternal country, the Soviet Union, is sincerely and selflessly helping us to build our medical and health undertakings. The cooperation between the Soviet Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross to establish the "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital" is precisely a manifestation of the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country in the field of medicine and health. On the one hand, imperialism is spreading disease-causing bacteria, attempting to massacre us on a large scale; on the other hand, the Soviet Union, with unparalleled sincerity and enthusiasm, is helping us to eliminate diseases and disasters and protect our health. In this stark and clear contrast, we see very clearly that only our true friend, the Soviet people, are sincerely and selflessly helping us.

    Through the "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital," the advanced Soviet medical ideology, medical achievements, medical management methods and systems, as well as the new medical style of wholeheartedly serving patients, will be introduced to our Chinese medical community, and help us to liberate ourselves from Western capitalist medical ideology, thereby improving our medical knowledge and technical level, and improving some of our undesirable medical practices. Undoubtedly, the establishment of the "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital" will provide extremely good assistance to our country's medical and health community.

    I sincerely congratulate the opening of the "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital" and express my deep gratitude to the Soviet people and the Soviet Red Cross workers for their great friendship of cooperation and assistance.

    祝贺“北京苏联红十字医院”的开幕
    中国红十字会总会会长  李德全
    “北京苏联红十字医院”在我国伟大的首都——北京开幕了。这在中苏两国的文化交流上，是有重大的意义的。它是中国红十字会与苏联红十字会，根据共同的国际主义和革命人道主义的思想，进行合作的一个具体实践。
    在中国近百年的历史上，有不少外国人到中国来办医院的事例。随着祖国解放，人民觉悟程度的提高，那些假“慈善”、“救助”之名干着侵略之实的阴谋都被彻底揭穿，那些帝国主义侵略者都被赶走了。当他们披着的“慈善”、“救助”的外衣被剥去以后，他们本来的狰狞面目就赤裸裸地显露了出来。美帝国主义在我国东北地区进行轰炸，最近并将细菌战扩大到我国东北地区，就是最好的说明。与此相反，伟大的兄弟国家苏联，却是赤诚无私地帮助我们进行医药卫生事业的建设。苏联红十字会和中国红十字会合作，成立“北京苏联红十字医院”，正就是苏联在医药卫生方面无私地援助我国的表现。一方面是帝国主义撒布传播疫疠的细菌，企图大规模杀害我们；一方面是苏联怀着无比恳切的热情，帮助我们消灭疾病灾难，保卫我们的健康。在这一个强烈而鲜明的对照之下，我们非常清晰地看到，只有我们真正的友人——苏联人民，才是赤诚无私地帮助我们的。
    通过“北京苏联红十字医院”，将会把苏联人民先进的医学思想、医学成果、医学管理方法与制度，以及全心全意为病人服务的新的医疗作风介绍给我们中国的医药界，并帮助我们从西方资本主义的医学思想中解放出来，从而提高我们的医疗知识和技术的水平，改善我们某些不良的医疗作风。无疑的，“北京苏联红十字医院”的成立，将会给我国医药卫生界以极其良好的帮助。
    我衷心地祝贺“北京苏联红十字医院”的开幕，并对苏联人民及苏联红十字会工作者这种合作与帮助的伟大友情致以深深的谢意。
