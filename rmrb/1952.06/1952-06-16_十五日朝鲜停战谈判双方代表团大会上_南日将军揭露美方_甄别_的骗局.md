Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 15th: At the fifteenth plenary session of the Korean Armistice Negotiations, our chief representative, General Nam Il, exposed the U.S. side's deception of detaining prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "screening," pointing out that all "screening" itself directly violates the Geneva Convention. Our side will never agree to any so-called "joint re-screening," nor will any neutral country or organization with a sense of justice and self-respect be willing to participate in illegal actions that directly violate the Geneva Convention, conducting so-called "fair re-screening." General Nam Il once again suggested that the other party carefully reconsider their position and accept our plan for prisoners of war to return home and live peaceful lives as the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue of prisoner repatriation. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

    "The issue of prisoner repatriation is simply the issue of the warring parties repatriating the prisoners of war they hold after the armistice, and it is not permissible to obscure the truth of this issue with any pretext. The 1949 Geneva Convention has clear provisions that any so-called 'screening' is illegal and cannot be permitted. Since your side expressed its willingness to resolve the issue within the framework of the proposal to repatriate 132,000 of our captured personnel, and our side put forward a compromise plan to guarantee that both sides' prisoners of war return home to live peaceful lives, the issue of prisoner repatriation had already reached the verge of negotiated settlement. It is only because your side has broken faith and attempted to forcibly detain our captured personnel under the pretext of illegal 'screening' that the issue of prisoner repatriation has become the only obstacle to the armistice. The responsibility lies entirely with your side. Our side has never agreed to screening, nor will it ever agree to or participate in any so-called 'joint re-screening.' Any truly neutral country or organization that is not yet prepared to tear up the Geneva Convention will never agree to or participate in any so-called 'fair re-screening.' All 'screening' itself is unjust and violates the Geneva Convention. The so-called 'screening' that your side has carried out or has not carried out is fundamentally illegal. Your side itself has publicly admitted that the so-called 'screening' results you have put forward are without any basis. Your side's deception of detaining prisoners of war under the pretext of 'screening' has gone bankrupt. If your side is truly sincere in negotiating a settlement of the prisoner repatriation issue and achieving an early armistice in Korea, you should simply abandon all the self-deceiving nonsense about screening and return to the path of negotiating a settlement of the prisoner repatriation issue. Now your side is repeatedly proposing so-called 'joint and fair re-screening,' which only shows your determination to block the door to a negotiated settlement of the prisoner repatriation issue and deliberately delay the armistice negotiations. But the issue must be resolved. In order to negotiate a settlement of the prisoner repatriation issue on a reasonable basis, our side has made many major efforts and put forward a reasonable compromise plan that allows prisoners of war on both sides to immediately return home and live peaceful lives. Our May 2nd plan fully complies with the Geneva Convention and is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner repatriation issue. If your side truly cares about the future welfare and happiness of soldiers and their families, you have no reason to insist on your plan to detain prisoners of war, separating them and their families, and oppose our plan to guarantee that prisoners of war on both sides return home to live peaceful lives. For the sake of the armistice in Korea and for the benefit of the prisoners of war on both sides and their families, I suggest that your side reconsider your position."

    十五日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    南日将军揭露美方“甄别”的骗局
    【新华社开城十五日电】十五日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军揭露了对方藉口所谓“甄别”扣留战俘的骗局，指出一切
    “甄别”本身，就直接违反日内瓦公约。我方绝不会同意任何所谓“共同再甄别”，也绝不会有任何具有正义感和自尊心的中立国家或机构愿意参与直接违反日内瓦公约的非法行动，进行所谓“公正再甄别”。南日将军再次建议对方重新慎重考虑对方的立场，接受我方遣返战俘回家过和平生活的方案为解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “战俘遣返问题，就是停战后交战双方遣返它们收容下的战俘的问题，不容许用任何藉口来模糊这一问题的真相。一九四九年的日内瓦公约订有明确规定，任何所谓‘甄别’都是非法的，不能容许的。从你方表示愿在遣返十三万二千我方被俘人员的提案轮廓内解决问题，和我方提出保证双方战俘回家过和平生活的折衷方案后，战俘遣返问题本已达到协商解决的边缘。只是由于你方背信弃义藉口非法的‘甄别’，企图强行扣留我方被俘人员，才使战俘遣返问题，成为阻碍停战的唯一障碍。其责任完全在于你方。我方从未同意过甄别，也绝不会同意或参与任何所谓‘共同再甄别’。任何还不准备撕毁日内瓦公约的真正中立的国家或机构，也绝不会同意或参与任何所谓‘公正再甄别’。一切‘甄别’本身就是不公正的，违反日内瓦公约的。你方所进行或未进行的所谓‘甄别’，根本就是非法的。你方自己已公开承认，你方提出的所谓‘甄别’结果是没有任何根据的。你方藉口‘甄别’扣留战俘的骗局，已经破了产。如果你方确有协商解决战俘遣返问题早日达成朝鲜停战的诚意，你们就应该干脆收起一切关于甄别的自欺欺人的鬼话，重新回到协商解决战俘遣返问题的道路上来。如今你方一再提出所谓‘共同与公正的再甄别’，只是表示你方决心杜绝协商解决战俘遣返问题之门，蓄意拖延停战谈判。但问题是必须解决的。为了在合理基础上协商解决战俘遣返问题，我方已经作了多次重大的努力，提出使双方战俘得以立即回家过和平生活的合理折衷方案。我方五月二日方案，完全符合日内瓦公约，是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。如果你方真正关心士兵和他们家庭的未来福利与幸福，你方就没有任何理由坚持你方扣留战俘的方案，使他们和他们的家庭骨肉离散，而反对我方保证双方战俘回家过和平生活的方案。为了朝鲜的停战，为了双方战俘和他们家庭的利益，建议你方重新考虑你方的立场。”
