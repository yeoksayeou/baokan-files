Editor's Note: We have previously published articles on the content, characteristics, teaching steps, and teaching experience of the rapid literacy method created by Qi Jianhua. To provide readers with a more systematic understanding of this literacy method, we are publishing a "Speech" (divided into seven lectures) prepared by the Cultural and Educational Office of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission based on the cultural teaching experience of the Southwest Military Region over the past two years (this speech was previously published in the Southwest Military Region's "People's Warrior" newspaper, and supplemented and adapted by the Cultural and Educational Office of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department). The rapid literacy method is not only suitable for the military but also for workers, peasants, and other working people, as proven by experiences in various regions. Therefore, this "Speech" written for the military is also very useful for literacy education for workers and peasants. Literacy education workers in various regions, especially teachers who use the rapid literacy method, can supplement and improve it from various aspects based on actual situations and their own teaching experience to enrich the content of the rapid literacy method.

Lecture 1: Why Can Literacy Be Accelerated?

When people first hear about the rapid literacy method, they often have a common doubt: "It's already very difficult to memorize three to five characters a day; now, you want us to learn a hundred or even several hundred characters a day, we can't just eat and drink them, how is that possible?" People with a higher level of education don't believe it because of their previous difficult experiences learning to read; people with a low level of education or who are illiterate believe it even less. However, it is an undeniable fact that the rapid literacy method can be used to quickly eliminate illiteracy. Here, we begin to introduce the principles of the rapid literacy method:

The rapid literacy method was created during the all-army literacy campaign in 1950. The rapid literacy method basically has the following three characteristics:

First, in terms of teaching philosophy, the rapid literacy method starts from the various strengths of adult soldiers and workers and peasants. Our adult soldiers and workers and peasants have a high degree of political consciousness. In actual combat, work, and various military and political activities, they have encountered great difficulties due to illiteracy or limited literacy. Therefore, they realize that without culture, it is too difficult to take on the task of building a modernized national defense army and building an industrialized New China. Therefore, their demand for cultural knowledge is very urgent. As one student who started learning with the rapid literacy method said: Our desire to improve our culture "is like marching sixty miles under the scorching sun and wanting to drink boiled water!" Because this thirst for knowledge is based on political consciousness, coupled with the combat-oriented work style of the troops, and the fact that our troops have grown stronger in the struggle to overcome difficulties, they fully demonstrate their consciousness, tenacity, courage to overcome difficulties, and spirit of research in cultural learning. Furthermore, comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds in the military have rich experience in struggle and life knowledge. Although they do not know or know very few of the individual square characters, they generally understand the meaning that the pronunciation of a character may represent. This is different from children learning characters. Children mainly rely on rote memorization, while adults can learn characters through association and by applying their life experience. For example, there is a person whose name you have heard many times before, but you have never met. One day, someone introduces you to this person, and you can naturally quickly associate the person's name with the person. In addition, adults have strong comprehension and very strong ability to associate, which is also one of the bases for rapid literacy. For example, adding the character "兑" inside the character "门" makes the character "阅" which means "read" and this character is not easy to remember, but as long as you mention the "阅" in "阅兵 (military parade)" to the soldiers, they will quickly remember it. This rich knowledge of struggle and ability to associate are unmatched by children. This is the first reason why our soldiers or workers and peasants can achieve rapid literacy.

Second, in terms of teaching leadership, the thoughts of teachers and students are highly consistent. Some people say, "Adults have poor memory." Actually, that is not the case. It is mainly because adults are exposed to a wide variety of affairs, and their thoughts are not as simple and concentrated as children's. As long as we can create conditions for concentrated thought and utilize and develop the advantage of adults' "strong comprehension," the effect and results will be much better than simple rote memorization. Many adults who have learned with the rapid literacy method have said from their actual experience: "We can memorize two or three hundred familiar and understandable characters a day." At the same time, people who were previously considered "slow" can also achieve the goal of rapid literacy as long as we are good at guiding and inspiring them to break through the "can't learn" barrier.

How do we create conditions for concentrated thought? First of all, our comrades in the military have a high degree of organization and discipline. They believe in the Communist Party, believe in the leadership, and believe in their superiors. As long as we conduct thorough mobilization, explain the tasks and methods clearly, dispel various doubts and concerns, and, under the principle of democratic centralism, give full play to the leadership role of teachers and the spirit of students consciously studying hard, the task can definitely be completed. This is the second reason why literacy can be accelerated.

Third, in terms of teaching methods, we adopt the method of "massive assault, dispersing difficulties, and gradually occupying, consolidating, and improving." As mentioned above, because comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds in the military have a very urgent need for cultural knowledge, they are "eager for success" and want to see results quickly and quickly apply what they have learned. At the same time, they like simplicity and dislike complexity. Therefore, the old teaching method, which requires people to be able to read, speak, write, and use every character they learn, the so-called "four abilities," makes learners feel that literacy is too difficult and too far removed from application. In fact, it is also unreasonable to require the so-called "four abilities" all at once; if we insist on doing so, it will greatly affect the confidence of learning. The rapid literacy method is different. It takes more than 2,000 commonly used single characters as a unit, separates the "four abilities," first requires a preliminary ability to read and speak (the two should not be separated), and then requires the ability to write and use. Each center follows another center, and each center is simple, making it easy to learn. At the same time, regardless of which center, a massive assault method is adopted to make it easy for learners to see their progress. In this way, in a very short period of time, students can preliminarily use what they have learned (being able to read general books and newspapers is part of being able to use it). Every time students learn a step, they can see the results at any time, and their confidence and determination are greatly improved. This is the third reason why literacy can be accelerated.

The above three characteristics, in terms of the rapid literacy method itself, are inseparable from the strong leadership of the Communist Party organization in our military, and inseparable from our army's consistent emphasis on cultural education and the fine tradition of linking teaching with reality and following the mass line. At the same time, it is also the result of the active and creative work of our military's cultural education comrades. The members of our People's Army naturally have these conditions. The working people of New China also have these conditions, so they can all use and develop these characteristics to eliminate illiteracy and improve their cultural level.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    编者按：关于祁建华所创造的速成识字法的内容、特点、教学步骤和教学经验，本报曾经陆续发表过一些文章。为了使读者较有系统地了解这个识字法，我们特将人民革命军事委员会总政治部宣传部文教办公室根据西南军区两年来文化教学经验所编写的“讲话”（共分七讲）连续发表（此讲话稿曾刊载于西南军区“人民战士”报，经总政治部宣传部文教办公室补充改编而成）。速成识字法不仅适用于部队，也同样适用于工人、农民及其他劳动群众，这已经由各地经验证明了。因此，这篇为部队编写的“讲话”，对于工农识字教学也有很大的用处。各地识字教育工作者，尤其是用速成识字法进行识字教育的教员们，可以根据实际情况和自己的教学经验，从各方面加以补充和改进，使速成识字法的内容更加丰富起来。第一讲为什么识字可以速成？
    开始听到速成识字法的人，往往有一个共同的怀疑：“一天学三五个字记起来还非常困难；现在一天要学百十个甚至好几百个字，又不是吃字喝字，那怎么可能？”文化水平较高的人，因为自己有了以往学识字的困难经验，不相信这回事；文化水平低或不识字的人更不相信。但是，这是不容怀疑的事实，运用速成识字法就可以很快地扫除文盲。这里我们开始向大家介绍速成识字法的道理：
    速成识字法，是一九五○年全军扫除文盲运动而创造出来的。速成识字法基本上有以下三个特点：
    第一，在教学思想上，速成识字法是从部队工农出身的成年人的各种优点出发的。我们部队中工农出身的成年人，他们具有高度的政治觉悟，他们在实际战斗中、工作中和各种军事政治生活中，由于不识字，或识字很少，都受到过很大的困难。因此他们认识到：没有文化，要想担负起建设现代化国防军、建设工业化新中国的任务，实在太困难了。所以，他们对文化知识的要求非常迫切。正像一位开始用速成识字法学习的学员说的：我们要求提高文化“就好比在强烈的太阳光照射下，急行军六十里，想喝开水的劲头儿！”正因为这种如饥似渴的要求是建立在政治觉悟的基础上的，再加上部队同志战斗化的工作作风，和我们部队是在战胜困难的斗争中壮大起来的，他们在文化学习中充分地表现了自觉性、顽强性，克服困难的勇气和钻研的精神。再者，部队工农出身的同志，有着丰富的斗争经验和生活知识。他们对于一个个的方块字虽然不认识或者认识很少，但一般字的字音可能代表的意思，他们是懂得的。这和儿童学生字就不一样，儿童学生字，主要靠死记；成年人学生字，就可以通过联想，运用生活的经验去记生字。比方说：有这么一个人，你在很早以前曾多次地听说过他的名字，但是没有见过面，有一天有人把这个人给你介绍了一下，你自然能很快地把这个人的名字和这个人联系到一起了。此外，成年人理解力强，他们联想的能力也是非常强的，这也是识字能速成的根据之一。例如门字里加一个“兑”字是当“看”讲的 “阅”字，这个字并不好记，但是只要给战士们一说到阅兵的“阅”，他很快地就会记住了。这种丰富的斗争知识和联想能力，是儿童所赶不上的。这是我们部队战士或工农劳动人民识字可以速成的第一个道理。
    第二，在教学领导上，教员和学员的思想是高度一致的。有人说：“成年人记忆力差”，其实并不是这样，主要因为成年人接触的事务繁多，思想不会像儿童那样单纯集中。只要我们能创造出思想集中的条件，运用和发挥成年人“理解力强”的优点，其效果和成绩比单纯地死记要好得多。许多用速成识字法学习过的成年人，都以他们的实际经验说：“一天教二、三百熟悉的、能懂的字，我们都能记住。”同时，以往被大家认为脑子“笨”的人，只要我们能善于诱导、启发，突破“学不进去”的那一关，同样可以达到速成识字的目的。
    怎样创造思想集中的条件呢？首先，我们部队的同志们有高度的组织性、纪律性，他们相信共产党，相信领导，相信上级。只要深入地进行动员，把任务和方法交代清楚，打消各种怀疑和顾虑，并在民主集中的原则下，发挥教员的领导作用和学员自觉苦学的精神，任务一定能完成。这就是识字可以速成的第二个道理。
    第三，在教学方法上，采取“大量突击，分散难点，逐步占有、巩固和提高”的方法。上面说到了，由于部队工农出身的同志对文化知识的要求非常迫切，他们“急于求成”，要求很快地看到成绩，很快地把学会的运用起来。同时，他们喜欢单一，怕繁琐，因此，旧的教法，每教一字都要求要会念、会讲、会写、会用的所谓“四会”，就使学习的人感到识字太难，从学到用离得太远。事实上，一下要求所谓“四会”，也是不合理的；如果硬要如此，就会大大地影响学习信心。速成识字法就不同了。它把两千多个常用的单字作一单元，把“四会”分开，先要求初步会念会讲（二者不要分开），再要求会写和会用，一个中心接着一个中心，每个中心都是单一的，就容易学会。同时，不管那个中心，都是采取大量突击的方法，使学的人容易看到自己的成绩。这样，在很短的时间内，学员能够初步会用（能够阅读一般的书报，就是会用的一部分）。学员每学一步，随时都能看到成绩，信心和决心也就大大地提高了。这是识字可以速成的第三个道理。
    以上三个特点，就速成识字法本身而论，是和我们部队的共产党组织的坚强领导分不开的，是和我军一向重视文化教育和教学联系实际、走群众路线的优良传统分不开的；同时，它也是我军文化教育工作同志发挥了积极性和创造性所获得的成果。我们人民部队的成员固然具有着这些条件。新中国的劳动人民同样也有这些条件，所以都可以运用和发挥这些特点，来扫除文盲，提高文化水平。
