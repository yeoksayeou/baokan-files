Editor's Note: This novel was originally published in "Liberation Army Literature" in May 1952. It tells the success story of Zhang Laifu, a People's Liberation Army soldier, in a literacy experimental class. Readers can read it as a novel that encourages learning or as a teaching method or learning method for rapid literacy.

I. Learning Model Zhang Laifu

After the conclusion of the military region's rapid literacy experimental class, on the evening of September 6th, Comrade Zhang Laifu, walking and singing, happily returned to his company. He first handed a "Learning Model" banner to the political instructor, and then reported on his learning situation. He said: The higher authorities are very concerned about us. Although the time spent in school this time was not long, less than a month, it removed my illiteracy. I have already learned more than 2,300 characters, finished reading four volumes of the national language textbook, can read the "People's Soldier Daily," can write letters, and can also write articles. As he spoke, he gave his grade book to the political instructor to look at. In this notebook, there were letters and articles, neatly written, a considerable amount indeed, with a "Learning Experience" piece alone exceeding four hundred characters. The third platoon leader chimed in, "Ha! Your literacy level is much higher than mine."

This news spread quickly throughout the entire company like a gust of wind. Everyone said: This time, Zhang Laifu is really something. However, some people didn't believe it. The fifth squad leader said, "If you could learn so much in a month or so, there wouldn't be any illiterates in all of China." Li Chengwen joked, "You can't blow a water buffalo to life. To learn that quickly, the military region would have to have divine teachers!"

A large group of people gathered at the entrance of the company headquarters, some wanting to see if it was true, others wanting to hear about his experiences.

The company commander said, "I also have some doubts about this achievement. But the military region taught it, so it can't be fake. Let's have a public test today, and tomorrow we'll have Comrade Zhang Laifu report on his experiences."

Everyone agreed. A copy of "Never Lag Behind" was tossed from the crowd. No one spoke, all craning their necks, eyes wide, to see if Zhang Laifu could read it or not.

Zhang Laifu took the book and said to everyone, "Comrades! My learning achievements are not that good. If I mispronounce something, please correct me."

"Ha! Why stand on ceremony between family? Read it quickly!"

Comrade Zhang Laifu opened the book, randomly flipped to a page, and began to read.

He didn't read quickly, but every word was pronounced very clearly, like a machine gun firing in bursts, "dang, dang, dang, dang," and in a short while, he finished reading the article.

The listeners were all entranced, without a sound. Until Comrade Zhang Laifu finished reading, everyone seemed to wake up. The third platoon leader took the lead in applauding, and everyone followed suit with enthusiastic applause.

It was time for dinner, and the soldiers went to the mess hall, but everyone's thoughts were still on Zhang Laifu: "How did he learn it?"

II. Three-Year Plan

The next morning, the Fifth Company held a large meeting, partly to welcome the learning model's victorious return and partly to ask Comrade Zhang Laifu to introduce his learning experiences.

Comrade Zhang Laifu walked to the front of the stage, very unnatural. He didn't know where to start. He stammered a few polite words and then got to the main topic. Once he opened the floodgates, it was like a river bursting its banks, the more he spoke, the more energetic he became, not even noticing the sweat pouring down his body:

"Comrades! Everyone knows what kind of person I, Zhang Laifu, am. I'm not behind in marching, fighting, grain requisition, or troop training. Although I've been enthusiastic about learning literacy, my achievements haven't been great. I think: Only by improving my literacy can I do revolutionary work better.

"In 1949, when I first joined the army, the higher-ups mobilized us to learn literacy. The leaders said: 'Our People's Liberation Army has always valued cultural education. An army without culture is a foolish army!' That year, I made a three-year plan. I thought even if I learned three characters a day, I would still learn more than a thousand a year. After three years, if I learned about three thousand characters, that would be about right. At that time, our company only had one cultural instructor, who couldn't attend to both the A and B classes. After learning for more than two months, I only learned more than 150 characters. Later, when we advanced into Southwest China, I didn't have time to learn, and I forgot another forty or so. I thought: 'This year is a write-off. I'll start the three-year plan from next year!' In 1950, we were again occupied with suppressing bandits. Our squad often operated independently, without an instructor or time. Seeing slogans, I'd learn 'Reduce Rent and Return Deposits'; singing songs, I'd learn 'Who Am I Fighting For?' This year was even worse. Learning painstakingly, I managed to learn about a hundred characters. In 1951, I was promoted to squad leader, and the difficulties of not having literacy became even more obvious. I couldn't take notes in meetings, and my reports weren't comprehensive. It also greatly hindered my own progress. The Internal Service Regulations and the Drill Regulations were issued to the company, one after another. Those who knew how to read could read the books. I could only listen to the company commander, remembering half and forgetting half, and I couldn't lead the squad well either. I thought we were building a modern national defense army, but without literacy, there was a great obstacle in front of us as soldiers of the national defense army! At that time, I really wished I could learn three thousand characters in one breath, but everyone said you can't bite off more than you can chew, so I had to be patient and learn slowly, three or two characters at a time. Don't think that three or two characters are easy to learn, because they're also easy to forget. After learning for half a year, I learned one or two hundred characters, couldn't read books or write articles, and forgot almost everything as soon as the central task came. It was like a monkey picking corn, counting and forgetting at the same time. By July of this year, I could only recognize 320 characters.

"At the end of July, our company decided to send me to study at the military region. I heard that I could learn two thousand characters in a month. At that time, my thinking was the same as everyone else's. I thought: After learning for two and a half years, I've only learned these 320 characters. How could I learn two thousand in a month? Even if I cracked my head open, I couldn't fit it all in. But then I thought, if it really was like that, my three-year plan would be guaranteed. Thinking it over and over, I was both happy and doubtful. Before leaving, the political instructor told me: 'Go boldly, the leadership of the higher authorities is always correct. If you follow the Party, you can be victorious.'"

III. Mobilization Meeting

"On August 4th, we arrived at the military region's rapid literacy experimental class. There were already quite a few people who had reported. Talking to each other, our thinking was similar. Everyone wanted to learn quickly, but no one knew how to learn.

"On August 5th, the teacher held a day-long mobilization meeting for us. He said: 'Comrades! Learning literacy this time is different from before. We're using the rapid literacy method to teach. In three weeks, you can learn more than 2,000 characters, be able to read books and newspapers, and also write articles. This new method was created by Comrade Qi Jianhua after more than a year of work, and it has been successfully tested in many units.' He told us the story of Comrade Qi Jianhua, and then explained the principles of the rapid literacy method. What he said was really right, starting by saying: 'Our worker and peasant comrades have culture.' I thought, if we had culture, why would we come to study? But the teacher's explanation was reasonable. He said: 'We are all adults in our twenties and thirties, who have heard a lot and seen a lot. This is culture. But the culture of our worker and peasant comrades is one-sided: we can only say it, but not write it. Learning to recognize characters now is to make our one-sided culture comprehensive.' As the teacher said this, he drew a submachine gun on the blackboard. He asked everyone: 'What is this?' We all shouted: 'Submachine gun.' The teacher then asked: 'Do five- or six-year-old children know what this is called?' We said: 'That goes without saying, how would a child understand this!' The teacher then wrote three characters on the blackboard, asking if everyone recognized them. I only recognized the character 'gun,' and some people didn't recognize any of them. The teacher said: These are the three characters 'submachine gun.' Children go to school, not recognizing either the gun or the characters, relying solely on rote memorization. We recognize the gun, but not the characters. By connecting the gun with these three characters, it's done. Therefore, it is very easy for adults to learn to recognize characters using this method, and they can remember 300 characters a day.

"The teacher then continued: 'There are no stupid soldiers in our People's Liberation Army.' Hearing this, it was another new saying. People always say that intellectuals have flexible minds, but he said the opposite. But the teacher's explanation was still reasonable. He said: 'We're not stupid in marching and fighting. If we were stupid, the reactionaries would have defeated us long ago. The Kuomintang's "Youth Army" was full of intellectuals, but weren't they wiped out by our Liberation Army! Some people say that worker and peasant comrades are not stupid in fighting, but they are stupid in learning literacy. But that's not necessarily true. In the past, progress in learning characters was slow because the method wasn't good. We didn't distinguish between children and adults, teaching the same way. One character would be explained for half a day. Everyone understood it already, but the teacher kept teaching it with all his might. The time was wasted. Now we use new methods. The teacher is patient, and the students are focused. I guarantee you'll learn quickly.'"

"After the mobilization meeting, most of the ideological problems were solved. There were also many learning achievements of others posted on the wall. With both reasoning and facts, you couldn't help but believe it.

"At mealtimes, I was still thinking about what the teacher said, and the more I thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. I thought: I've lived for so long, and I've been taught like a child for more than two years. For example: Once, the cultural instructor talked about the character 'person' in class, with stories about monkeys turning into people, and about poor people and rich people, and about strokes and stances, a bunch of chaotic explanations that lasted a full two hours. Who wouldn't understand what 'person' meant? But he didn't care if you understood or not, he just had to keep explaining it. The time was wasted in vain."

IV. "Cultural Great Leap Forward"

"August 6th was the first official day of class in the experimental class. After the leaders and the Party branch secretary gave another round of mobilization speeches, the teacher began the class.

"The teachers in the experimental class were very patient, and their teaching methods were different from the past. In class, they didn't lecture from the book, but first taught a song. In our company, a song would take at least a week to learn, but here, they taught it in three minutes."

Comrade Zhang Laifu said to this point, and the third platoon leader interjected, "Teach it in three minutes? I'm afraid that's not possible?"

Zhang Laifu smiled and said, "I didn't believe it at the time either, but later, they really taught it in three minutes. If you don't believe it, let's have an on-the-spot experiment!"

The bugler brought the clock over, and it was exactly 8:20.

Zhang Laifu imitated the teacher and began to teach the song. Everyone stared, watching to see if he was really that effective.

"Everyone get ready. Now we're teaching the song. This song is called 'Cultural Great Leap Forward.' I'll sing it once first, so you can hear if it's good or not?"

In the past, characters tormented people, but today people will torment characters,
A roughneck for decades, today will turn his life around.
The rapid method is good, attacking in large quantities.
Chairman Mao leads us, in the Cultural Great Leap Forward.

After singing, Zhang Laifu asked, "What do you all think, is it good?"

A shout of "Good!" roared from below like thunder.

"I'll sing it again, everyone don't sing along."

After singing it three times, many people started humming along softly. When Zhang Laifu sang it the fifth time, everyone hummed louder.

Zhang Laifu said, "Alright, now everyone sing together! Ready – begin!"

After singing like this twice, everyone could sing it, the sound loud and clear. Looking at the clock, it was exactly 8:23.

V. Thirty-Seven "Foreign Languages"

After a ten-minute break, Comrade Zhang Laifu continued to speak:

"After the teacher taught the song, our mood was very high, pretty much like your mood just now. Everyone said: 'The teacher is really something, he really has a method.'

"Then, the teacher began to teach the phonetic symbols. When I saw these things, with their weird faces, neither characters nor pictures, I thought: The teacher is just coming up with ideas, not teaching the real stuff, teaching this 'foreign language.' It was really strange, the teacher seemed to have burrowed into my heart. As soon as I thought this, he explained, saying: 'Phonetic symbols are not a foreign language. They're like a sign, hanging on the body of an unfamiliar character, so that you can recognize any character.' He then gave several examples, writing a whole string on the blackboard, such as the 'yi' in conference, the 'yi' in benefit, at least a dozen of them. He said that these characters are all pronounced 'yi.' As long as you learn the character 'yi,' and hang this sign on these characters, you can call out their name wherever you go. These few sentences also opened up my mind. I thought: 'These thirty-seven symbols are so useful. I'll spend five days breaking my head to learn them!'

"But, I was wrong again. The teacher used a 'tiger pounces on the heart' teaching method, first teaching the middle ones ㄧㄨㄩ, then reaching out to both sides. While teaching, he also explained. It was interesting and easy to remember. For example, for 'ㄍㄎㄏ,' the teacher would say 'Brother is thirsty, thirsty and drinks water.' Like a gust of wind, it only took forty minutes to teach everyone.

"During the break, I reviewed my thinking: Our old ways of thinking are not working anymore. From now on, I won't think about anything else. I'll follow the teacher's instructions exactly, and I'm sure to be successful."

VI. Sichuan Representative

"After teaching the phonetic symbols, the teacher gave each person a 'Phonetic Symbol Chart,' cut into thirty-seven pieces according to the squares on the chart, one symbol on each piece of paper, and told us to take them to the mutual aid group to practice 'moving house.'

"Our group had a total of four people, all of whom knew around 200 to 500 characters. One was called Zhou Dabao, one was called Li Yushan, and the other was an old comrade in his forties, Wang Xuewen. The three of us were from the north, and only old Wang spoke a pure Sichuan dialect. The four of us gathered together, and you took out a symbol for me to recognize, and then I took one out for you to recognize. Recognizing and recognizing, we started arguing. Once, I took out a 'ㄋ' character, and Comrade Old Wang insisted on pronouncing it 'ㄌ.' We all said it was wrong, but he insisted on pronouncing it 'ㄌ.' Later, the teacher gathered everyone together and asked Comrade Old Wang to pronounce 'ㄉㄊㄋㄌ,' but he pronounced it as 'ㄉㄊㄌㄌ,' which made everyone laugh. The teacher said: Don't laugh, Sichuan people don't distinguish between 'ㄋ' and 'ㄌ.' Sichuan students can just pronounce it like Comrade Wang. He's our 'Sichuan representative.' Ha! This was lively. Shanxi also had a representative, who didn't distinguish between 'ㄣ' and 'ㄥ,' pronouncing 'ㄢㄣ尢ㄥ' as 'ㄢㄥ尢ㄥ.' People from Guangdong were even more interesting, pronouncing 'ㄗㄘㄙ,' 'ㄓㄔㄕ,' as 'ㄐㄑㄒ,' which made everyone's stomachs hurt from laughing, but they became 'Guangdong representatives.'

"This time when we practiced 'moving house,' there was no more arguing. When class was dismissed in the afternoon, I had mastered all thirty-seven symbols. Comrade Old Wang only had two symbols he wasn't familiar with, 'ㄞㄟ,' but everyone was moved by his spirit of hard study and hard practice. The weather in August was terribly hot, but Comrade Old Wang only focused on practicing 'moving house,' the sweat flowing down his face, without even wiping it off. He said: 'In front of Communists, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. If we can show the spirit of climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing the grasslands, we can learn even ten more!' By evening, he had learned all of them. Everyone said: 'Even an old comrade in his forties hasn't fallen behind. We young men have to work even harder!'"

VII. First Sound Light and Short, Second Sound Heavy, Two Sounds Connected, Rush Vigorously

"On August 7th, we started learning Pinyin. Single Pinyin wasn't difficult. Anyway, you just pronounced the symbol as it was pronounced, without having to spell it. Double Pinyin was different. Two phonetic symbols placed together had to produce another sound. It's really embarrassing to say, yesterday I saw that my learning achievements were great, but today I relaxed a little. When the teacher talked about the key points of Pinyin, I didn't remember them clearly. When I practiced in the mutual aid group, I really made a fool of myself. For example, for these two characters 'ㄅㄚ,' I spelled them for a long time, but couldn't put them together. Either I spelled out a 'ㄅ' or I spelled out an 'ㄚ.' Everyone else could spell them, but I couldn't, and I was worried about falling behind. I remembered the difficulties I encountered in my work because I couldn't read, I remembered the difficulties I had in military and political studies because I couldn't read. I also thought: I'm a Youth League member, and I've never fallen behind in marching and fighting. Now that I'm falling behind in learning, who am I letting down? Yesterday, Comrade Old Wang set an example for us. I have to learn from the Communist Party! So, I made up my mind that even if I didn't eat today, I had to get through this hurdle. During the lunch break, I didn't dare to sleep. I found Zhou Dabao to study together. He said: 'You can't spell the sound because you haven't remembered the key points. As long as you pay attention to the first sound being light and short, the second sound being heavy, and the two sounds connected, rushing vigorously, it'll work.' He gave me many examples, like 'ㄙㄢ three,' 'ㄉㄤ party,' and in a short while, I figured it out. I tried it when I went back, and it was indeed correct.

"Comrade Old Wang had even more trouble than I did. He was always afraid to 'rush.' He kept pronouncing 'ㄅㄚ, ㄅㄚ' for a long time. The sound of 'eight' was already being spelled out, but if you asked him what sound it was, he would still say it was a 'ㄅ, ㄚ.' Later, we thought of a method. Take this 'ㄅㄚ,' for example. We stipulated that he wasn't allowed to say 'ㄚ,' and we asked him to loudly shout a sound that was similar to 'ㄚ,' which would squeeze out the character 'eight.'

VIII. Pinyin Key Points Song

"On August 8th, we started learning three-Pinyin. The teachers reviewed yesterday's work. The main shortcoming was that the key points weren't explained in enough detail. There wasn't enough mobilization before explaining the key points, so there were several students like me who encountered difficulties. Today, the teaching method was improved again. Before class, we first taught a 'Pinyin Key Points Song.' It had these sentences:

Double Pinyin spelled accurately, then learn the three-Pinyin.
First spell the first and second sounds, then spell with the third sound.
ㄇㄧ spells 'mi,' then 'mi' ㄣ spells 'min.'

"After learning the song, the key points of three-Pinyin were also remembered well. After the teacher taught for a while, the four of us gathered together again and returned to the group to practice. I thought this time there wouldn't be any problems, but who knew, there were problems again. The first and second sounds were spelled out, but the third sound was forgotten. By the time I remembered it, what I had just spelled was forgotten. Taking care of the top, I couldn't take care of the bottom, and I was so anxious that I was sweating all over, and couldn't spell out a sound for a long time. Later, the teacher copied all the 'ㄅㄧ bi,' 'ㄆㄧ pi,' 'ㄆㄨ pu,'... on the blackboard, and asked us to memorize them. There were a total of twenty-nine. They were easy to say and interesting. I could recite them in the time it took to eat a meal. This time, it was like getting on an airplane. Before evening, I had mastered three-Pinyin.

IX. This is a Good Method

"After learning three subjects in three days, on August 9th, the subject changed again. Today, we started attacking new characters. The teacher walked into the classroom as usual, very seriously. The first sentence he said was: 'Comrades, learning Pinyin is like mastering a weapon. Today, we're picking up this weapon to attack new characters. Today, our task is to learn 300 characters. Communist Party members and Youth League members must lead everyone, bringing the spirit of charging and attacking bunkers. We will only advance, not retreat!'

"The new character list was turned to the first page, and the teacher began to teach. He taught very quickly, teaching 100 characters in less than 20 minutes. This teaching method was very different from before. He only said one thing about each character. For example, '速' [sù, fast] was 'the "速" of acting swiftly,' '肩' [jiān, shoulder] was 'the "肩" of carrying a gun on the shoulder.' The explanations were simple and easy to remember, as if they were stamped on your brain, so no one would forget.

"After teaching 100 characters, it was group review again. First, with Pinyin, spelling and explaining. After reviewing three or four times, we covered up the Pinyin and just read the characters. Zhou Dabao even created a method: the characters that could be spelled and explained were marked with a dot, like an enemy who had been wounded by us. The characters that could be read without looking at the Pinyin were marked with a circle, like an enemy who had been captured by us. After they were captured, we would circle them and not worry about them, concentrating on capturing those who were wounded, and those who hadn't been wounded yet. Using this method, we reviewed five or six times, and all 100 characters were captured. Then, the teacher taught another 100 characters. By 4 o'clock in the afternoon, all 300 characters had been taught. In the evening, the group sat together to check the results of the battle. The task of 300 characters was completely completed. Comrade Old Wang's results were slightly worse. He also captured 273 prisoners, wounded 24 enemies, and there were still three that he could only spell but not explain.

"When the lights went out, I lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. I was so happy. Today, I learned 300 characters. Subtracting the characters I already knew, there were still more than 100 new characters. Today alone was more than I learned in a year. Thinking about the old methods of teaching literacy, they were completely methods for teaching children. The rapid literacy method is the good method specifically for teaching us adults! If I could capture over 2,000 characters like this, I really don't know how to thank the higher authorities for cultivating me."

X. Symposium

"On August 10th, we attacked another 300 characters. Of these 300, I had more than 200 new characters. I didn't dare to be careless at all during class.

"In the evening, when checking the results of the battle, I again completely completed the task. That day, Li Yushan only learned 220 characters, and Zhou Dabao only learned 95 characters. He was in low spirits, constantly saying that he was stupid and couldn't keep up, and asked to be demoted to Class C. Everyone was very anxious. After attacking for only two days, he was losing confidence. What would happen later? Before lights out, we held a symposium to study learning methods and find the reason why Old Zhou was falling behind.

"Everyone started talking, you saying a word, I saying a word.

"Li Yushan said: 'I have many shortcomings. Today I only learned 200 characters. I should review my actions. The 300 characters taught yesterday, when I looked at them, there were many characters I already knew. Reviewing with the mutual aid group, I always felt that everyone was slow, and not enjoyable. This morning when we were reviewing, I hid under a big tree and worked alone. This time I was really racking my brain. The teacher taught so much, and today most of them are new characters. I would remember this and forget that. In the afternoon, I saw that it wouldn't work, so I returned to the group. Although the group is slower, if I don't know something, you do, and if you don't know something, he does. Many people have great strength, and we finished reviewing in a little while. Tomorrow, I promise not to work alone again. Helping others is helping myself.'

"Wang Xuewen said: 'The teacher thought of this long ago. The mutual aid group does a "head-on collision," and 300 characters are pretty much covered. Reviewing alone, you can't remember everything even if you crack your head open. Also, I have some opinions about Comrade Zhou Dabao's learning methods. He only reads the Pinyin, and doesn't pay attention to explaining the character. With Pinyin, he can read 300 characters, 600 characters. Without Pinyin, they are all new characters. Didn't the teacher say that new characters also need to be related to life? If you can't explain them, you can't relate them to life. If you can't relate them to life, you can't leave the Pinyin.'

"Then, Zhou Dabao reviewed his actions. Sometimes he wasn't focused during class. As soon as his mind wandered, several characters had already been taught. Looking back at the book, he couldn't even find where they had been taught.

"Finally, it was my turn to speak. I said: 'For the past few days in class, the teacher has been saying to focus your mind every day. In the past, I didn't know how to focus. Today, I figured it out. It's like your ears, growing on your head, the ear holes have to be aimed at the teacher's mouth. It's like your eyes, growing on your face, the eyeballs have to be fixed on the book. That's what you call focusing your mind. If you do that, you're sure not to lose any characters.'

"After the meeting, the teacher made a summary. He said that everyone's opinions were very correct. He also wanted to introduce these experiences to other groups."

XI. Three Treasures

"After attacking new characters for three days, I had learned 876 characters. August 12th was a Sunday. In the morning, I reviewed everything from start to finish, and learned the remaining 24 characters. In the evening, we had an entertainment party. The programs were all written and performed by ourselves. The Third Class sang a 'Goal of Two Thousand Three'; the Eighth Class performed a double act, praising Zhu Caixi in their class. The best program was a quick-clapper talk by the Seventh Class, called 'Three Treasures.' This program lasted less than three minutes, but it was really helpful to everyone. Even now, I still remember this quick-clapper talk very clearly. It said:

Remembering new characters, there are three treasures:
The first is to learn Pinyin well.
Recognizing characters is like catching sheep, put on a symbol and they can't run away.
Don't be afraid that the new characters will cause trouble, when it's roll call time, they'll always be there.

The second is to relate it to life.
New characters are all individual, life experiences are a set.
The method of rote memorizing single characters is stupid, tie them into a set and they can't run away.
If you don't understand, it's not easy to remember, you can only remember it if you understand.
Take the character '乎' [hū, seemingly], '之乎者也' [zhī hū zhě yě, classical particles] is hard to remember.
'合乎规定' [hé hū guī dìng, in accordance with regulations] is a wonderful way to explain it.
Take the character '善' [shàn, good] say it as '慈善' [cí shàn, charity] and it's hard to understand.
'改善生活' [gǎi shàn shēng huó, improve life] is so much better!

The third is that looking at the shape of the character is most important.
Chinese characters have rules. '切剪劈刺' [qiē jiǎn pī cì, cut, shear, chop, stab] all use '刀' [dāo, knife].
'花茶菜苗' [huā chá cài miáo, flowers, tea, vegetables, seedlings] all have '草' [cǎo, grass].
The '挑' [tiǎo, challenge] in '挑战' [tiǎo zhàn, challenge] has the '手' [shǒu, hand] radical, change it to '木' [mù, wood] and it's '桃' [táo, peach].
The character 飘 [piāo, float] seems scary, but it doesn't scare anyone.
A wind radical and a 票 [piào, ticket] radical, what else could it be but float?

Don't panic when you see a new character, cut it into pieces and look carefully.
There are familiar characters inside the new character, rely on the familiar characters and you can remember it well.
Master the three treasures, and work together to attack the bunker.
Attacking 300 characters a day, not a single prisoner is left behind.

XII. Cleaning the Battlefield

"Attacking new characters took a full eight days. After all 2,366 characters had been taught, the teacher gave us a new task—cleaning the battlefield: Reviewing everything from start to finish, and filling in those that couldn't be explained or recognized. In the entire new character book, there were only 35 characters that I didn't recognize. These guys, I couldn't relate them to real life, and there was no way to split them into familiar characters. For example, the character '乃' [nǎi, then, therefore], we've never seen it in the language of workers and peasants. And the character '肃' [sù, solemn], round and smooth, headless and brainless. I had spelled those two characters at least 20 times before I remembered them. Li Yushan said: These guys are mischievous, let's call it "sitting in solitary confinement." Saying that, he circled those mischievous characters with red ink, so you could see them from far away. Exposing the target like this made reviewing easier.

"Just like that, reviewing while capturing scattered soldiers, for a whole day, I reviewed 1,400 characters. The next day was again Sunday. My clothes were dirty, but I didn't bother washing them. Washing a piece of clothing wasn't a big deal, but it would delay at least 200 characters. None of us were willing to rest. By evening, Wang Xuewen, Li Yushan, and I had all completed the task 100%. The test scores were all 2,366.

"Comrade Zhou Dabao was slightly worse. But since watching the party last time, he figured out the key points and made rapid progress. On the second day of attacking new characters, he only recognized more than 90 characters. From the fifth day on, he was learning 250 to 260 every day. He said: Before I didn't understand the methods, it was like walking a small path in the mountains, winding and turning, so I couldn't walk fast. Later, once I found the key points, it was like touching the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, running fast without any effort.

"After the three of us finished reviewing, we concentrated our efforts to help Zhou Dabao. By Monday afternoon, he had also caught up. The test score was 2,327.

"The task of attacking new characters was successfully completed. Our group had the highest scores, and we helped each other very well, so everyone elected us as a model group. I was very happy in my heart: One was that I became a model, and everyone supported me. Two was that I learned more than 2,000 characters. My three-year plan was completed. I removed the illiteracy hat. The great obstacle to building a modern national defense army was stepped over in the first step!

"Coincidentally, the allowance was issued that day, so we bought some peanuts and held a small group meeting to celebrate the victory. Everyone recalled the thoughts we had when we first started studying, and we really laughed until our stomachs hurt. Zhou Dabao said: When I first came, I thought that learning 300 characters a day, unless you knock a hole in your head and stuff them in. Now it seems, my head wasn't knocked open, but I really did stuff in more than 2,000 characters!

"Later, we thought, after recognizing so many characters, is it solid? Will we forget them later? But then we thought: The teacher thought of everything more thoroughly than we did. Learn exactly as you're taught, and you're sure to be steady."

XIII. Even Chairman Mao's Articles Can Be Read

"Attacking new characters, including reviewing and testing, took a total of 11 days. On the 21st, we changed to a new subject. In the past, teachers would come to class empty-handed, and leave empty-handed, with only a new character book, which was still in their pockets. Today, he held a large bundle of books in both hands, and the communication soldier even helped him carry more.

"The teacher walked onto the podium and talked about the learning achievements of the past few days. Many comrades were praised. Then he said: Everyone has worked very hard to recognize more than 2,000 characters in 11 days. Today, let's change the flavor, and see if the characters we recognize can "move house." He issued four volumes of the national language textbooks to each person, from the first volume to the fourth volume, asking everyone to read them from beginning to end.

"It was group activity again. We found a shady place and started reading. The first volume was easy to read, the characters were big, and the sentences were short. We finished reading it before noon. Then we started reading the second volume...

"Just like that, one volume after another, we finished reading all four volumes of the national language textbooks in three days. I thought: In the company,

    文化大进军
    王勉执笔
    编者按：这篇小说原载“解放军文艺”一九五二年五月号，写的是一个叫张来福的人民解放军战士在速成识字实验班学习文化的成功经验。读者可以把它当作一篇鼓舞学习情绪的小说读，也可以当作一篇速成识字法的教学方法或学习方法来读。
    一    学习模范张来福
    军区速成识字实验班结业以后，九月六号的晚上，张来福同志，一边走一边唱，高高兴兴的回到了他的连队。他首先把一面“学习模范”的奖旗交给指导员，跟着就汇报他的学习情形。他说：上级对我们太关心了，这回住学，时间虽说不长，前后不到一个月，可把我这顶文盲帽子给摘掉了。我已经认会两千三百多字，读完了四册国语，能看“人民战士报”，会写信，还会写稿。说着，就把成绩本子送给指导员看。这本子里，又是信，又是稿，整整齐齐的，可真写了不少，光是一篇“学习心得”，就有四百多字。三排长凑过来说：“哈！你这文化水平比我高多了。”
    这个消息，就像一阵大风，很快传遍了整个连队。大家都说：这回张来福可真不简单了。但是，也有人不相信，五班长说：“要是一个来月就能学这么多，全中国早没文盲了。”李成文开玩笑说：“黄牛不是吹起来的。要能学的这么快，除非军区有神仙教员！”
    一大群人围到连部门口，有的想看看真假，有的想听听经验。
    连长说：“这个成绩，我也有些怀疑。可是军区教的，不会假了。今天咱们先来个当众测验，明天再叫张来福同志给咱们报告经验。”
    大家都同意了。人群中扔过一本“永不掉队”来。没有一个人出声，都伸着脖子，瞪着眼睛，看张来福能念不能念。
    张来福接过书来，对大家说：“同志们！我的学习成绩不顶好，念错了大家纠正。”
    “哈！一家人还要客气，快念吧！”
    张来福同志打开书本，随便翻到一页，就开始念了。
    他念的并不快，可是每个字都念得很清楚，就跟机关枪点发一样，噹噹噹噹地，一会儿就把这篇文章念完了。
    听的人都出神了，一点声音也没有。直到张来福同志念完了，大家好像才醒过来似的。三排长领头鼓起掌来，大家也跟着热烈的拍起手来。
    开饭了，战士们纷纷走到饭堂上，可是大伙的思想还拴在张来福的身上：“他是怎么学的呢？”
    二     三年计划
    第二天早上，五连开了一个大会，一方面算是欢迎学习模范胜利归来，另一方面也算是请张来福同志介绍学习经验。
    张来福同志走到台前，很不自然，一肚子话也不知从那说起，他结结巴巴的讲了几句客套，就归到正题上来了。这一家伙，话匣子一打开，就跟决了堤的大水一样，越说越带劲，累到浑身大汗也不觉得：
    “同志们！大家都知道我张来福是怎么个人，行军、打仗、征粮、练兵，我都不算落后。学习文化虽说也很积极，可是成绩不大。我想：只有把文化提高了，才能把革命工作做得更好。
    “一九四九年的时候，我刚参军，上级动员学文化。首长说：‘我们人民解放军，向来是重视文化教育的。没有文化的军队，就是愚蠢的军队！’那年，我就订了个三年计划。我想就算一天学三个字，一年还学一千多，花上三年工夫，认上个三千多字，就差不多了。那阵子，咱们连里只有一个文化教员，顾了甲班，顾不了乙班。学了两个多月，才认会一百五十多字。后来，进军大西南，顾不上学了，又忘了四十多。我想：‘今年算报销了，三年计划从明年开始吧！’到了一九五○年，又赶上剿匪。我们一个班经常单独活动，又没教员，又没时间，看见标语，学个‘减租退押’；唱个歌子，学个‘我为谁来打仗’。这一年就更差劲了，紧学慢学，算是认会了一百多字。一九五一年，提升我当班长，没有文化知识的困难就更明显了。开会不能作记录，汇报不全面。对自己的进步提高，也有很大妨碍。内务条令，队列条令，一本一本的发到连里来了。人家认字的都能看书。我只能听连长讲讲，记一半忘一半，班里也就领导不好。我想咱们是要建设现代化国防军的，可是没有文化，当国防军战士的面前就横着一条大障碍！那时候，我真恨不得一口气学它三千字，可是人家都说贪多嚼不烂，只好耐着性子，三个两个的慢慢学吧。别看三两个字好学，可是也容易忘。学了半年，认会一二百字，看不了书写不了稿，中心任务一来就忘得差不多了。这就跟猴子掰包谷一样，一边数，一边忘，到今年七月，我才能认三百二十个字。
    “七月底，咱们连里决定调我到军区住学，听说一个月就能认两千字。我当时的想法，也跟大家一样。我想：学了二年半，才学会这三百二十字，一个月就学两千，敲破我脑袋也装不进去。可是又一想，要是真能这样，我这三年计划就有保证了。想过来，想过去，又高兴，又怀疑。临走时，指导员对我讲：‘大胆去吧，上级的领导向来是正确的，跟着党走，就能胜利。’
    三     动员会
    “八月四号，我们到了军区速成识字实验班。那里已经有不少人报到了。大家谈起来，思想都差不多，谁也愿意学的快，可是谁也不知道怎么学法。
    “八月五号，教员给我们开了一天动员会。他说：‘同志们！这回学文化，可跟从前不同。咱们是用速成识字法来教，三个礼拜就能认会两千多字，能看书、报，还能写个稿子。这个新的方法，是祁建华同志用了一年多的时间，所创造出来的，在很多单位都实验成功了。’他给我们介绍了祁建华同志的故事，随后，又讲速成识字法的道理。他讲的真对劲，一开口就说：‘咱们工农同志有文化。’我想有文化还来住学干啥？可是人家教员讲的有理。他说：‘咱们都是二三十岁的成年人，听的多，见的广。这就是文化。但是，咱们工农同志的文化是片面的：只能用嘴说，不能用笔写。现在学认字，就是要把片面的文化叫它全面起来。’教员说到这里，就在黑板上画了一支冲锋枪。问大家：‘这是什么？’我们都喊着说：‘冲锋枪。’教员又问：‘五、六岁的娃娃知不知道这叫啥？’我们说：‘那还用说，娃娃还能懂这个！’教员又在黑板上写了三个字，问大家认不认得？我只认得一个‘枪’字，有人一个也不认得。教员说：这就是‘冲锋枪’三个字。小孩子上学，又不认得枪，又不认得字，单凭死记。咱们认得枪，不认得字，把这支枪和这三个字联系起来，就成了。所以，成年人用这个办法学认字非常省力，一天学三百字也能记住。
    “教员接着又说：‘咱们人民解放军没有一个笨兵。’我一听，又是一句新鲜话，人家都说知识分子脑筋灵活，他偏反着说。可是，还是教员说得有理。他说：‘行军、打仗，咱们都不笨。要是笨的话，早叫反动派打垮了。国民党“青年军”倒都是知识分子，还不是叫咱解放军给歼灭了！有人说，工农同志打仗不笨，学文化笨，其实也不见得，过去学字进步不快，那是方法不好，不分娃娃、成年人，一样教法，一个字就讲半天，大家早就懂了，教员还一股劲教。现在咱们用新方法，教员耐心，学员专心，保你学得快。’
    “动员会开罢之后，思想问题大部分都解决了。墙上还贴了好多别人学习的成绩。又有道理，又有事实，想不信也不由你了。
    “开饭的时候，我还想着教员的话，越想越有理。我想：活了这么大，叫人家当小孩子教了二年多。比方说吧：有一回，文化教员上课讲‘人’字，又是猴子变人，又是穷人富人，又是一撇一捺，又是立人儿、卧人儿，乱七八糟讲了一大堆，足足讲了两个钟头。谁还不懂‘人’是什么意思？可是他不管你懂不懂，非讲下去不可。时间都白白浪费了。
    四  “文化大翻身”
    “八月六号，这是实验班正式上课的头一天。首长和党支部书记又作了一番动员之后，教员就开始上课了。
    “实验班的教员可耐心了，他们的教法也跟过去不一样。一上课，不讲书，先教一个歌子。咱们在连里，一个歌子至少要学一个礼拜，人家三分钟就教会了。”
    张来福同志说到这里，三排长插了一句：“三分钟就教会？怕不行吧？”
    张来福笑了笑说：“当时我也不信，后来，硬是三分钟就教会了。大家不信的话，咱们来个当场试验！”
    司号员把钟拿来了，刚好八点二十分。
    张来福学着教员的样子，开始教歌。大家都瞪着眼睛，看他到底灵不灵验。
    “大家准备好。现在教歌了。这支歌子叫‘文化大翻身’，我先唱一遍，大家听听好不好？”
    从前是字整人，今天要人整字儿，
    几十年的大老粗，今天要把身翻。
    速成的方法好，大量来突击。
    毛主席领导咱，文化大翻身。
    唱完以后，张来福问：“大家说好不好呀？”
    底下跟打雷一样，喊了一声“好！”
    “我再唱一遍，大家不要唱。”
    唱过三遍之后，好多人都跟着小声哼起来了。张来福唱第五遍的时候，大家哼的声音更大了。
    张来福说：“好了，现在大家一块唱吧！预备——起！”
    这样唱过两遍，大家都会唱了，声音又大又整齐。看看表，整整八点二十三分。
    五    三十七个“洋文”
    休息了十分钟，张来福同志继续往下讲：
    “教员教完歌子，我们的情绪可高了，就跟大家刚才那情绪差不多，都说：‘教员可不简单，真有办法。’
    “接着，教员开始教注音符号。我一看这些家伙，怪眉怪脸的，字不像字，画不像画。我想：教员光出点子，不教正课，教这‘洋文’。说也真怪，教员就好像钻到我的心眼里一样。我刚这么一想，他就解释开了，说：“注音符号不是洋文，它好比是个牌子，挂在生字身上，什么字也能认。”他还举了几个例子，在黑板上写了一大串，什么会议的
    “议”呀，利益的“益”呀，足有十多个。他说这些字都念“一”，只要学会这个“一”字，把这块牌子挂在这些字上，走到那里也叫得应。这几句话，又把我的思想打通了。我想：“这三十七个符号，这么有用，破上五天工夫，非把它学会不可！”
    “可是，我又想错了。教员用了个‘猛虎掏心’的教法，先教了中间的一ㄨㄩ，再往两边掏，一边教，一边讲，又有意思，又好记，比方‘ㄍㄎ厂’，教员就讲‘哥哥渴了，渴了喝水’，就跟一阵风一样的，只用了四十分钟，就把大家都教会了。
    “休息的时候，我检讨了一下思想：咱们那老一套的想法都吃不开了。往后，什么也不要想了，教员怎样教，就跟着怎样学，保险稳当。
    六  四川代表
    “教完了注音符号，教员发给每人一张‘注音符号表’，按照表上的方格，剪成三十七块，一块纸片上一个符号，叫我们拿到互助小组去练习‘搬家’。
    “我们小组一共四个人，都是认二百多字、五百不到的，一个叫周大保，一个叫李玉山，还有一个四十多岁的老同志王学文。我们三个都是北方人，只有老王说了一口道道地地的四川腔。我们四个人凑在一块，你拿出个符号来叫我认，我再拿一个叫你认，认来认去，就争起来了。有一回，我拿出一个‘ㄋ’字，老王同志偏念‘ㄌ’，我们都说不对，他却非坚持念‘ㄌ’不行。后来教员把大家集合起来，叫老王同志念‘ㄉㄊㄋㄌ’，他却念成了‘ㄉㄊㄌㄌ’，逗得大家都笑了。教员说：不要笑，四川人就是‘ㄋ?’不分的；四川学员都照着王同志这样念法就行了。他就是咱们的‘四川代表’。哈！这一下可热闹了，山西也出了代表了，他们‘ㄣㄥ’不分，把‘ㄢㄣ尢ㄥ’念成个‘ㄢㄥ尢ㄥ’。广东人更有意思，他们把‘卩ㄘㄙ’，‘ㄓ彳尸’，都念成‘ㄐㄑㄒ’，把大家的肚子都笑痛了，可是他却当了‘广东代表’。
    “这回再练‘搬家’，就不争论了。下午下课的时候，我就把这三十七个符号都搬熟了。老王同志也只剩‘ㄞㄟ’两个符号不熟，但是，他那种苦学苦练的精神，大家都很感动。八月的天气，热的要命，老王同志只顾练习‘搬家’，汗水顺着脸往下流，连擦都不擦。他说：‘在共产党员面前，没有克服不了的困难，拿出爬雪山、过草地的精神来，再教十个也能学会！’到晚上，他全部学会了，大家都说：‘四十多岁的老同志都没有掉队，我们年轻小伙子更得努力啦！’
    七  前音轻短后音重，两音相连猛一冲
    “八月七号，开始学拼音了。单拼音倒不难，反正符号念啥就念啥，不用拼就行。双拼音就不同了，两个注音符号放在一块，得碰出另外一个音来。说起来也真丢人，昨天我看学的成绩很大，今天就有点松劲。教员讲拼音要领的时候，我就没记清，到互助组练习的时候，可就光出洋相了。比方‘勹丫’这两个字吧，拼了半天，硬是碰不到一块去，不是拼出个‘勹’来，就是拼出个‘丫’来。别人都能拼了，我还不会，眼看就要落后，可把我急坏了。我想起因为不认字，在工作中碰到的困难，我想起因为不认字，在军事、政治学习中的困难，我又想到：我是一个青年团员，行军、打仗都没落后过，这次学习落后了，对得起谁呢？昨天，老王同志给我们作了榜样，我要向党员看齐！于是，我下定了决心，就是今天不吃饭，也得冲过这
    一关。中午休息的时候，我不敢睡觉了，找周大保
    一齐研究。他说：‘你拼不出音来，是要领没记清，只要能注意着前音轻短后音重，两音相连猛一冲，就行了。’他又给我打了不少比方，什么‘厶ㄢ三’呀，‘ㄉㄤ党’呀，一会儿，我就捉摸的差不多了，回去一试，果然很对。
    “老王同志比我还吃力些，他总是不敢‘冲’。
    ‘勹丫’、‘勹丫’念半天，‘八’的声音都拼出来了，可是你要问他是什么音，他还说是个‘勹、丫’。后来我们想了个办法，就比如这个‘勹丫’吧，规定他不准说‘丫’，叫他大声喊一个和‘丫’差不多的音，就把‘八’字给挤出来了。
    八  拼音要领歌
    “八月八号，开始学三拼音了。教员们检讨了昨天的工作，主要的缺点，是要领讲得不够详细；讲要领之前，又没有很好的动员，所以，像我这样碰到困难的学员，还有好几个。今天，教法又改进了。上课之前，先教了一个‘拼音要领歌’。有这么几句：
    双拼音拼得准呀，再学那三拼音。
    先拼那一二音，再跟那三音拼。
    冖一拼成‘米’呀，‘米’ㄣ就拼成‘民’。
    “歌子学会了，三拼音要领也记熟了。教员教了一阵，我们四个人又集合起来，回到小组练习。我想这回不成问题了，谁知又出了毛病。一二音拼出来了，第三音又忘了，等把它想起来，刚才拼的又忘了。顾了上，顾不了下，急得满头大汗，半天拼不出一个音来。以后，教员把所有的什么‘勹一比’、‘攵一皮’、‘攵ㄨ扑’……都抄在黑板上，叫我们大家背熟。总共二十九个，又顺嘴，又有趣，一顿饭工夫我就会背了。这回，就跟坐上飞机一样，没到晚上，就把三拼音也拼熟了。
    九  这才是好办法
    “三天学了三个课目，八月九号，课目又变了。今天开始突击生字。教员和往常一样，很严肃的走进课堂，头一句就说：‘同志们，学好了拼音就好比掌握了武器，今天咱们就拿起这个武器来突击生字。今天我们的任务是学会三百个字。共产党员、青年团员要带领大家，拿出冲锋、打碉堡的精神来，只有前进，没有后退！’
    “生字表翻到第一篇，教员开始教了。他教的可快呀，不到二十分钟就教了一百个字，这个教法，跟从前大不一样，一个字只说一个讲儿，比方‘速’就是‘动作迅速的速’，‘肩’就是‘枪上肩的肩’，讲的又简单，又好记，就跟钢印印到脑子里
    一样，谁也不会忘。
    “一百个字教完了，又是小组复习，先是带着注音符号，一边拼，一边讲；复习过三四遍，就把注音符号蔽起来，光念字。周大保还创造了一个办法：能拼能讲的字，就给他画上个点儿，好比敌人已经被我们打伤了。不看注音符号能念的字，就给他画上个圈儿，好比敌人已经被我们俘掳了。已经俘掳过来的，圈起来以后就不要管它了，集中力量去捉那些负伤的，和还没负伤的。我们用这个方法，复习了五六遍，这一百字就都俘掳过来了。然后，教员再教一百字。到下午四点钟，这三百字教完了。晚上，小组坐在一块清查战果，三百个字的任务全部完成了。老王同志成绩稍差些，也抓住了二百七十三个俘虏，打伤敌人二十四个，还有三个光会拼不会讲。
    “熄灯了，我躺在床上，翻过来，覆过去，怎么也睡不着。我太高兴了。今天一天就学了三百字，扣掉熟字，还有一百多生字。这一天就顶我一年学的还多。想从前教文化那一套，完全是教小孩子的办法，速成识字法才是专门教咱们成年人的好办法！照这样，两千多字都俘掳过来，我真不知该怎么感谢上级对我的培养。
    十  座谈会
    “八月十号，又突击了三百字。这三百，我有二百多生字。上课的时候，我一点也不敢大意。
    “晚上，清查战果的时候，我又是全部完成了任务。这一天，李玉山只认会二百二十个字，周大保只学会了九十五个字。他情绪很低，光说自己笨，跟不上，要求降到丙班去。大家都很着急。刚突击两天，就失掉信心了，往后怎么办呢？熄灯之前，我们开了个座谈会，研究一下学习方法，找一找老周掉队的原因。
    “大家你一言，我一语的说开了。
    “李玉山说：‘我有很多缺点，今天只学会了二百多字，应该检讨。昨天教的三百多字，我一看熟字很多，跟着互助组一块儿复习，总嫌大家慢，不过瘾（一ㄣ），今天上午复习的时候，我就躲到一棵大树底下，个人单独干起来了，这一家伙可伤脑筋了，教员教的那么多，今天又多半是生字，记住这个，忘了那个。下午，我看不行了，又回到小组，虽说小组慢些，可是我不会的你会，你不会的他会，人多力量大，一会就复习完了。明天，我保证不再单独活动，帮助别人也就是帮助自己。’
    “王学文说：‘人家教员早想到这一步了。互助小组来个“硬碰头”，三百字就碰个差不多。一个人复习，碰破了脑袋，也不能都记下来。另外，我对周大保同志的学习方法，也有个意见。他光念拼音，不注意讲字。带着注音，三百字、六百字都能念；丢了拼音，都是生字。教员不是说过，生字还要联系生活吗？不能讲，就联系不到一块。联不到一块，就离不开注音。’
    “接着，周大保检讨了，有时上课思想不集中，心里刚往旁处一想，好几个字就教过去了。回头再看书，连教到什么地方都找不见了。
    “最后轮到我发言。我说：‘前几天上课，教员天天说思想集中。以前，我也不知该怎么集中法。今天，我可摸到门啦。好比这只耳朵，长在你的头上，耳朵洞就得开到教员的嘴巴上。好比这只眼睛，长在你的脸上，眼珠子就得安到书上。这就叫思想集中了。这么做，保险丢不了字。’
    “会开完了，教员做了总结。他说大家的意见都很对。他还要把这些经验介绍给别的小组。
    十一  三件宝
    “生字突击了三天，我认会了八百七十六个字。八月十二号是个礼拜天。上午我从头到尾复习了一遍，把那剩下的二十四个字也认会了。晚上，我们开了个娱乐晚会。节目都是我们自己编、自己演的。三班唱了一个‘目标两千三’；八班演了一段双簧，表扬他们班里的朱才喜。最好的节目是七班的快板，叫‘三件宝’。这个节目，总共不到三分钟，对大家的帮助可真不小。直到现在，这个快板我还记得很清楚。它说：
    记生字，有三件宝：
    第一件，注音符号要学好。
    认字好比揽牛羊，挂上个符号就跑不了。
    不怕它生字多捣蛋，几时点名几时到。
    第二件，联系生活要搞好。
    生字都是单个的，生活经验都成套。
    死记单字的办法笨，拴成一套就跑不了。
    不懂也就不好记，能懂才能记得牢。
    就拿这个‘乎’字说，‘之乎者也’就不好记，
    ‘合乎规定’就讲的妙。
    再拿这个‘善’字说，讲成‘慈善’就不好懂，
    ‘改善生活’有多好！
    第三件，多看字形最重要。
    中国字，有规矩，‘切剪劈刺’都用‘刀’，
    ‘花茶菜苗’都有‘草’。
    ‘挑战’的‘挑’是‘手’字边，换成‘木’就
    是‘桃’。
    飘字好像很吓人，其实谁也吓不倒，
    一个风字一个票，不是飘扬是啥飘？
    看见生字莫心慌，切成几块仔细瞧，
    生字里头有熟字，依靠熟字就能记得牢。
    三件宝，掌握好，配合起来攻碉堡，
    一天突击三百字，一个俘虏也漏不掉。
    十二  打扫战场
    “突击生字，整整搞了八天。两千三百六十六个字都教完了，教员又交代了一个新任务——打扫战场：从头到尾再复习一遍，顺带把那些不会讲的、不会认的补起来。整本生字本，我只有三十五个字不认识。这些家伙，既不能联系生活，又没办法拆
    （彳ㄞ）成熟字。比方这个‘乃’字，咱们工农的话里头，根本就没见过它；再比如这个‘肃’字，圆圆溜溜，无头无脑，这两个字，我至少拼过二十来遍，才把它记住。李玉山说：这些家伙，调皮捣蛋，都叫它‘坐禁闭’吧。说着，他把那些捣蛋字都用红笔圈起来，老远就看见它了。这样把目标暴露出来，复习起来就省事了。
    “就这么连复习、带抓散兵，一整天，我复习了一千四百字。第二天，又是礼拜天。衣服都脏了，我也顾不上洗。洗件衣服不打紧，至少耽误二百字。我们四个人，谁也不肯歇气，到晚上，王学文、李玉山和我三个人，都百分之百的完成了任务，测验成绩都是两千三百六十六。
    “周大保同志稍差些。可是自从上回看了晚会之后，摸到了要领，进步也很快。突击生字的第二天，他只认了九十多个字；第五天往后，每天都在二百五六。他说：从前不明白方法，就好比在山上走小路，绕弯弯转圈圈，就是走不快。后来，我一找到要领，就好比摸到了成渝铁路，不费力气还跑得飞快。
    “我们三个人复习完了，就集中力量帮助周大保。到礼拜一下午，他也赶上来了。测验成绩是两千三百二十七。
    “突击生字的任务，胜利地完成了，我们这个小组，成绩最高，平时互助也很好，大家把我们选成模范组，我心里非常高兴：一则是当了模范，大家拥护；二则是认会了两千多字，我的三年计划完成了，文盲帽子摘掉了，建设现代化国防军的大障碍我跨过第一步了！
    “凑巧那几天刚发了津贴费，我们买了点花生，还开了个庆祝胜利的小组会，大家回想起刚住学那时候的想法，真笑得肚子疼。周大保说：刚来那两天，我想一天学三百字，除非把脑袋敲个洞，往里装。现在看起来，脑袋也没敲破，硬是装了两千多字！
    “后来，我们想，认了这么多字，巩固不巩固呢？往后忘不忘呢？可是又一想：教员比我们想的周到，怎么教就怎么学，保险稳当。
    十三  毛主席的文章也能读了
    “突击生字，连复习、带测验，一共搞了十一天。到二十一号，换了新课目，往常教员上课，都是空手来，空手去，只有一本生字本，还装在口袋里。今天，他两手抱了一大捆书，通讯员还帮他提了不少。
    “教员走上讲台，讲了这几天学习的成绩，很多同志都得到了表扬。随后他说：十一天认了两千多字，大家都很辛苦了。今天换换口味，看看咱们认的字能不能‘搬家’。他发给每人四本国语，从第一册到第四册，要大家从头读一遍。
    “又是小组活动了。我们找了个阴凉地方，开始读起来。第一册很好念，字又大，句子又短，不到中午就读完了。接着开始读第二册。……
    “就这么一本接一本的，三天功夫就把四册国语都读完了。我想：在连里，连第一册都啃不下来。现在，三天连升四级，真是作梦也没想到。
    “读国语的当中，我们也碰到过一些困难。读到第三册国语以后，字变多了、变小了。我们刚刚学过的生字，也还不顶熟，读一个字，想一个字，念得格格楞楞（ㄌㄥ）的，连不成句子。有时候，上句跟下句念到一块去了，字倒是都认得，意思就摸不清。比方第四册有这么一课，我们读成‘过年的时候李三，豹，请了假回家，看看一边，走一边，想家，里的人怕，都饿，坏了吧！’念完了，也把人气死了。后来教员说：‘先把字念出来，碰到那圈圈和点点的地方，再换气。’照他这说法，再念一遍：‘过年的时候，李三豹请了假回家看看。一边走，一边想：家里的人，怕都饿坏了吧？’意思就搞明白了。
    “还有一回，我们读书的时候，碰到一句‘长期奋斗’。这个‘长’字，突击生字时，教员说是
    ‘班长的长’，用到这里念成‘长（ㄓㄤ）期奋斗’，谁也听不懂。后来，老王说：问问教员吧，保不定‘班长的长’，也能当‘长（彳ㄤ）期奋斗的长用’。一问教员，果然这样。教员还说：这就是咱们成年人理解力强的好处。一个字有好几个念法，只教一个，就能悟到其他几个了。
    “从这往后，差不多天天发书，有‘这就是美国’‘人民的诸葛亮’‘快板剧’‘王克勤班’
    ‘纸老虎现原形’……还有‘人民战士’杂志、
    ‘人民战士报’‘中国青年报’。
    “王学文把他的包袱打开了。别看他认字不多，存的书可真不少。什么‘人人读’呀，‘怎样划分阶级’呀，‘新民主主义论’呀，‘论人民民主专政’呀……足有十好几本。他说：上级发的书，我一本也舍不得丢，背到今天，有了用了。有一天，他读完‘论人民民主专政’，整本只有二十四个生字。他高兴的跳起来，逢人便说：‘连毛主席的文章，我也能读了！’
    十四  俘虏站队、生字编班
    “整整阅读了三天，从八月二十四号往后，每天上午又增加了一个新课目，叫做‘俘虏站队’、
    ‘生字编班’。教员先讲十种偏旁，金字边、木字边、水字边、火字边、土字边、立人儿、挑手儿……然后叫大家到生字本上去点名，偏旁一样的就写在一块，算是编了一个班。
    “这下子，整个课堂就跟赶场的一样，大家都叫叫嚷嚷地开始‘编班’了。
    周大保拿着一支钢笔，对着生字本喊：
    ‘噢——点名喽！锻——锻炼的锻，金字边的，站到一班去！’
    ‘噢——点名喽！校——学校的校，木字边的，站到二班去！’
    “就这样，一个上午，我们每人都差不多编了二百来字。以后，教员每天教几个偏旁，我们也就编几个班。到二十七号，大大小小编了四十六个班，剩下一些不能编的，放在一堆，我们把它叫做‘补充团’。
    “李玉山说：‘从前是字整人，今天可真是人整字了。生字这一编班，我放心多了。一边点名，一边画像，再调皮捣蛋的字，也不用担心它“逃亡”了。往后，经常到“班”里转转，把每个生字的性能、特点，都了解清楚，把它们编成话，写成文章，那真是改造俘虏，为人民服务啦！’
    “以后，教员还教我们查字典。其实，经过‘生字编班’以后，查字典就没有什么困难了。只把几个特别规矩记住就行了，比如草字头要到‘艸’字部去找等等。有了字典，就好比又多了一位教员。在阅读中碰到个生字，翻翻字典就行了。
    十五  小记者
    “自从‘生字编班’以后，很多字都抄了一遍，到八月二十七号，教员教我们写话。我们四个人坐在一块，写啥呢？话说起来，真是三天也说不完，可是一要写，一句话也想不起来了。后来我想咱们来一个‘小记者’的游戏吧。咱们大家轮流当小记者，他随便问一句，别人回答，连问的带答的都写下来，就算是给墙报写稿。大家听这个方法很有意思，就开始搞了。
    “先是李玉山问周大保：‘你是那里人？今年多少岁？’
    “周大保说：‘我是河南人，今年二十三岁。’
    “李玉山写完了，轮到周大保问王学文：‘你为什么学文化？’王学文说：‘要建设现代化国防军。’
    “下回轮到王学文问我：‘你的三年计划完成了没有？’我说：‘完成了。’他写完之后，我想我还有心头话没说出口，就叫他再写上一句‘我们要感谢毛主席’。
    “大家都写完之后，我们把稿子拿出来，大家修改。前两句，字好写，倒没什么问题，后一句，可把人笑坏了。王学文把“计划”两个字，写成了技术的“技”，说话的“话”，把感谢的“感”写成了敢不敢的“敢”。讨论半天，才纠正过来。
    十六  给毛主席的信
    “下午，我们又变了个花样。一个人说，大家写。一句话接一句话，就编成一段文儿。就用这个办法，我们还给毛主席写了一封信呢！”
    说到这里，张来福同志掏出一个纸包来，找出那封信的底稿，念给大家听：
    “亲爱的毛主席：以前我们有很多话想跟你说，想问问你身体好不好，工作忙不忙。可是不会写字，不会写信。现在我们都认会了两千多字，你听见这消息一定很高兴。今天给你写信，不为别的事情，感谢你领导我们文化大翻身。这回到实验班，教员用新法子教，三天学了注音符号和拼音，八天突击生字，三天复习测验，我们都认了两千多字。这个办法很好，很对咱们工农兵的口味。我们回到连里之后，还要努力学习，不骄傲，不自大，巩固成绩，做好工作，建设强大国防军，来回答上级的关心。此致敬礼
     张来福  周大保   王学文  李玉山
    八月三十日”
    十七  推广速成识字法，消除文盲，提高部队文化水平
    张来福同志念完这封信，接着往下说：
    “自打八月六号开始上课，到三十号，整整四个礼拜，课目都教完了。三十一号，举行毕业典礼。在这以前，还有评选模范，发奖品，我就不详细讲了。”
    正在这时候，营部通讯员送来一份通知，指导员拿过来一看，连声说：“好，好。”接着，他拿起这份通知，对大家说：
    “同志们，大家听了张来福同志的报告，都很高兴。三排长刚才还说，他也要求去住学。现在好办了，上级已经决定在全军里面，推广速成识字法，消除部队文盲，提高部队的文化水平，给建设现代化国防军打下基础。营里来了通知，调咱们连上的三位教员到分区去学习这套新方法。大家说好不好啊？”
    战士们使足了力气，喊了一声“好！”
    三排长还领导大家呼了个口号：
    推广速成识字法！
    消除部队文盲，提高全军的文化水平！
