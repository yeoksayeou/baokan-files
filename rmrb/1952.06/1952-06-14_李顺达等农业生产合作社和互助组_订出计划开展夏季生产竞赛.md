The agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams led by Li Shunda, Han En, Jin Shilong, Su Dianxuan, and Pu Zhongzhi, who jointly initiated a comprehensive production increase competition among agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers nationwide, have all formulated summer production work plans after democratic discussions among their members, subsequent to the completion of spring plowing and sowing. They all regard summer hoeing, seedling protection, topdressing, pest control, wheat harvesting, and seed selection as the central tasks for the current period and have made appropriate arrangements for these tasks.

    **Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative**

    The main content of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative's plan (Editor's note: This summer production plan is a recently revised plan by the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative and differs slightly from the summer production plan mentioned in the cooperative's letter to farmers participating in the national production increase competition published in this newspaper on May 30th) is: 1. Seedling Protection, Topdressing, and Summer Hoeing: Autumn fields should be hoed three times universally, with 60% utilizing new-style weeding hoes. Seventy percent of the autumn fields should receive topdressing, averaging 20 dan per mu. The ten mu of high-yield land should be hoed four times, with 150 dan of topdressing applied per mu. The aim is to hoe and fertilize after each rainfall. 2. Resolutely Fight Against Natural Disasters: Before hoeing, two more drought canals and ten mu of beach land should be repaired. Prepare three sprayers and various pesticides to promptly eradicate various diseases and insect pests. 3. Vigorously Develop Forestry and Animal Husbandry: The cooperative will afforest 50 mu, press 300 mulberry branches, and repair 400 mu of forest slopes; collectively purchase 50 sheep, increase the number of pigs by ten, and each household will increase the number of chickens by 150; collectively build one pigpen and two stables. 4. Prepare Fertilizer and Fuel: Collect 10,000 dan of fertilizer (5,600 dan of stable manure, 800 dan of night soil, 3,000 dan of artemisia fertilizer; each male laborer accumulates 150 dan, and each female laborer accumulates 30 dan); transport 10,000 jin of coal and gather 5,000 jin of firewood, ensuring no shortage of fuel until after the autumn harvest and slack season. 5. Summer Harvest, Seed Selection, and Summer Planting: Ensure timely harvesting without losing a single grain of wheat; select 1.5 shi of seeds in the field; plant 20 mu of late beans after harvesting wheat. 6. Withdraw five surplus laborers to work in Taiyuan factories for 100 days, earning 4,500 jin of millet.

    **Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative**

    The main content of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative's plan is: (1) Summer Hoeing: Begin the first hoeing on June 1st. Land cultivated with new agricultural implements should be hoed using weeding machines, aiming for five hoeings and five passes. Manual hoeing around seedlings should be done during the second hoeing, and after the third hoeing, use crude plows to ridge the land. Land cultivated with old agricultural implements should be hoed three times and four passes. Hoe hilly and sandy land on rainy days and hoe flat and low-lying land on sunny days. Rice paddies should be transplanted in mid-June, fully implementing straight-row transplanting. 2. Seedling Protection: Corn planted with new agricultural implements should generally guarantee 3.5 seedlings per square meter, or 36,000 seedlings per hectare; land planted with old agricultural implements should guarantee 30,000 seedlings per hectare. Soybeans should have 30 seedlings per square meter, or 300,000 seedlings per hectare. Millet (粟) should be thinned evenly, with no missing seedlings. Rice paddies should guarantee 30 clumps of seedlings per square meter, with 20 seedlings per clump. To achieve this goal, seedling protection regulations should be established, seedling love education should be strengthened, seedling checks should be strictly enforced, timely replanting and transplantation should be implemented, and specialized labor should be assigned for thinning. Each person should use a one-meter-long "standard pole" when thinning seedlings; the technical research association should assign a dedicated person to lead seedling protection work. 3. Drought Prevention, Flood Prevention, and Pest Prevention: Early hoeing and timely ridging should be done for dry land. In dry weather, temporarily refrain from ridging flat land to retain moisture, and find ways to divert water for irrigation on high-yield land. Before hoeing, a one-and-a-half li long waterproof ditch should be dug in the mountains, and drainage ditches should be dug on flat land according to specific conditions to prevent waterlogging. Prepare autumn tree roots, tobacco stalks, and purchase two sprayers and some insecticides to eradicate pests at any time. 4. Topdressing: Soybeans, corn, millet, sorghum, and other crops are adapted to alkaline soil, but the local soil is highly acidic. Apply grass ash fertilizer (grass ash contains potash fertilizer and alkali) during the second hoeing. Apply 1,000 jin of ash fertilizer to the two hectares of high-yield land, and strive to apply more to the remaining land under possible conditions. Apply 1,500 jin of fertilizer field powder to the five hectares of rice paddies. Also, apply ash fertilizer to land inoculated with rhizobium. 5. Land Reclamation: During the ten-day gap before summer hoeing, withdraw eight male laborers and four livestock to use new-style land reclamation plows to reclaim two hectares of swampy wasteland.

    **Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative**

    The main content of the Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative's plan is: 1. Transplanting and Summer Hoeing: Rice paddies will be plowed twice, completed by June 9th, and transplanting will be done from June 11th to 20th. Rice paddies will be hoed twice with rice paddy weeding machines and weeded twice by hand. High-yield land, seed retention land, and next year's seedling land will be weeded twice for barnyard grass. Hoeing and ridging of dry and waterlogged land will end by August 10th. 2. Topdressing and Fertilizer Accumulation: 197 carts of topdressing will be applied to 11.63 hectares of rice paddies, 21 carts of topdressing will be applied to 1.77 hectares of sorghum, and 82 carts of topdressing will be applied to 6.8 mu of soybeans (using a mixed fertilizer of stable manure, human manure, and fertilizer field powder). Combine with green manure pressing during summer hoeing, cutting 28,000 jin of green grass to ensure sufficient fertilizer for next year. 3. Drought Prevention and Resistance, Seedling Checking and Replanting, and Pest Control: Establish a water usage agreement to save water; regularly block dams and cover the riverbed with clay to reduce seepage. Conduct a universal seedling check and replanting on dry land to ensure no missing seedlings; the drier it is, the more hoeing and ridging will be done. Assign dedicated personnel in each group to be responsible for checking the fields at any time, and eradicate insect pests immediately if they occur.

    **Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative**

    The main content of the Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative's plan is: 1. Seed Selection: Select 1,900 jin of local high-quality wheat varieties such as "Hong Xiuzi," and 200 jin each of six-row barley, vegetable peas, and white hyacinth bean seeds. 2. Summer Harvest: Harvest in a timely manner and thresh immediately after harvesting. 3. Summer Planting: Rationally divide labor, scientifically use labor, and ensure plowing and planting immediately after harvesting, completing harvesting, threshing, and sowing within ten days. If there is a drought, resist the drought and spot-plant. 4. Grain Delivery: Ensure drying and cleaning, and the entire cooperative will deliver the grain in one go.

    **Wang Mang Village Mutual Aid Joint Group**

    The main content of the summer production plan of the Wang Mang Village Mutual Aid Joint Group in Chang'an, Shaanxi, led by Pu Zhongzhi, is: 1. Three days before Mangzhong (Grain in Ear), all 693 mu of rice in the entire joint group must be transplanted. 2. Before the wheat harvest, all old agricultural implements must be repaired, and all new agricultural implements to be purchased (ten 5-inch step plows, seven Liberation-style waterwheels, one hundred small hoes, and fifty iron shovels) must be purchased. 3. After transplanting rice and before the wheat harvest, all 40.1 mu of cotton fields must be finely hoed twice. 4. Before the summer harvest, women will be responsible for selecting 5,000 jin of four high-quality wheat varieties such as "Hong Datou" and "Biyu" in the fields; in addition, exchange for a portion of "Bima No. 1" wheat seeds from other places. 5. To better match manpower, livestock power, and agricultural implements, temporarily merge the twenty-five small groups into six large groups during the summer harvest. Organize field protection teams to prevent theft and guard against various natural disasters. 6. Ensure that the crops of all military dependents in the village are grown as well as those of the mutual aid group members. 7. The public grain should be dried and cleaned, and delivered in one go within three days after the start of the collection.

To effectively complete these plans, the above agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have also stipulated some guarantee measures. 1. Strengthen political study, current affairs study, cultural study, and technical study to improve the awareness and technical level of members and group members, enhance everyone's patriotic production enthusiasm, conscientiously implement patriotic pledges, and strive to promote advanced production experience. Bring newspapers and periodicals to the fields and read them during breaks; bring blackboards and broadcasting tubes to the fields to carry out field propaganda and mobilization work in a timely manner. 2. Strengthen the leadership of the Party branch and cooperative cadres. Regularly go deep into the groups to understand the thoughts and emotions of the masses, cultivate and utilize activists, accurately calculate and rationally allocate manpower and animal power, and try out a system of contracted work with specialized personnel, fixed quality, and fixed quantity. Check advantages and disadvantages in a timely manner and carry out commendations and criticisms. 3. Closely integrate with supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the supply and marketing of means of production, means of living, and agricultural and sideline products. 4. Run rural nurseries well so that female laborers can participate in field labor. Do a good job in hygiene, clean streets and courtyards diligently, wash and dry clothes and bedding frequently, and clean and pad livestock pens frequently to ensure human health and strong livestock power.
