Helping Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Watch Movies

Our people's films and Soviet films are attracting more and more worker, peasant, and soldier audiences day by day. According to statistics, the number of film viewers nationwide increased by more than double last year compared to the previous year, totaling 360 million; among them, the audience from film projection teams in factories, rural areas, and military units reached 140 million. They warmly welcome people's films, mainly because they see them as an educational tool for expanding knowledge, improving ideological understanding, and inspiring enthusiasm for production and combat. Precisely for this reason, they are increasingly eager to understand the ideological content of films, especially the political significance they convey.

However, because film is a new art form that is not yet familiar to the broad masses, especially the peasant masses; coupled with the fact that some films have too-rapid scene changes, too-short durations of on-screen images, unclear explanations of event development, and the screenwriting method of flashbacks, to some extent, make it difficult for audiences to understand, or even misunderstand, its meaning, thus impairing the propaganda and educational effect of the film. It is such a pity that a good film cannot fully exert its power due to some avoidable shortcomings in the work!

If film institutions, including production and distribution agencies, as well as film writers, directors, and workers, study this issue and try to improve it, then the above-mentioned situation can be changed.

We believe that film work should mainly focus on improvements in two aspects:

First, in terms of film scripting and production, efforts must be made towards popularization and nationalization to make it easier for worker, peasant, and soldier audiences to accept.

Second, in terms of film screening work, the purely profit-oriented views of some film distributors and cinemas must be corrected. They should understand that helping the audience fully understand the content of the film is a work of political significance. For the dubbed films of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, it is especially necessary to strengthen the interpretation and publicity work. It is natural that the masses do not have enough understanding of the lives of foreign people. For example, the Soviet film "The Conspiracy" is one of the films with extremely educational significance, but many viewers have reported that they cannot fully understand it. Distribution and screening institutions should choose to adopt various methods to solve this problem, such as printing and distributing leaflets, displaying subtitles with projectors, and sending people to explain the content of the film before the screening. Adding a recording of the story outline when dubbing translated films and broadcasting it during the screening is also a worthwhile method to adopt. As for newspapers and magazines publishing popular film introductions and critiques in a timely manner, this is of course also necessary.

    帮助工农兵看电影
    我国人民电影和苏联电影，日甚一日地吸引着更多的工农兵观众。据统计，去年全国电影观众较前年增加一倍多，计三亿六千万人；其中工厂、农村、部队的放映队观众达一亿四千万人。他们热烈欢迎人民电影，主要因为他们把它看作一种扩充知识、提高思想水平、鼓舞生产和战斗热情的教育工具。正因为这样，他们越来越迫切地要求了解电影的思想内容，特别是它所传达的政治意义。
    但是由于电影是一种新的艺术形式，还没有为广大群众特别是农民群众所熟悉；加以一部分影片的镜头变动太快，画面形象停留时间过短，事件发展的线索交代不明，以及回叙故事的编剧方法，都在一定程度上使观众看不懂，甚至误会它的意思，使电影的宣传教育作用受到损失。一部好电影，由于一些工作上的可以避免的缺点，以致不能充分发挥它的力量，这是多么值得惋惜的事！
    如果电影事业机构，包括制作和发行机关，以及电影编导工作者，对这个问题加以研究并设法改进，那么以上所说的这种情况是可以改变的。
    我们认为电影工作，主要应从两方面着手改进：
    一、在影片编剧和摄制工作方面，必须向通俗化、民族化的方向努力，使工农兵观众易于接受。
    二、在影片放映工作方面，必须纠正一部分影片发行人员和电影院的单纯营利观点。他们应了解，帮助观众充分理解影片的内容，是一件具有政治意义的工作。对于苏联和人民民主国家的华语对白翻译片，特别要加强解释和宣传工作。因为群众对于外国人民生活的不够了解，是自然的事。例如，苏联片“阴谋”是极有教育意义的影片之一，可是有不少观众反映，他们不能完全看懂。发行和放映机构应选择采用印发说明书，打幻灯字幕，放映前派人讲解片子内容等种种方法来解决这个问题。翻译片在配音的时候，增加故事梗概的录音，在放映时播送，也是值得加以采用的办法。至于报纸刊物及时刊登通俗的电影介绍和批评，当然也是需要的。
