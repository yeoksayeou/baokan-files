    The Problem of Sales for "Substandard Tobacco" in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, Basically Solved
    Editor: The problem of sales for "substandard tobacco" in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, has basically been solved. The sales of tobacco in Xuchang experienced a period of sluggishness in February and March. Inferior tobacco was not being purchased, market management was lax, and illegal capitalists took the opportunity to exploit tobacco farmers by lowering the grades and prices, and reducing the quality of tobacco by adulterating it with water and impurities. In early April, the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office urgently instructed all counties to expand sales channels for "substandard tobacco" and strengthen market management. Xuchang City, Xiangcheng County, Yu County, Changge County, and other places successively organized forces to conduct market inspections, convene symposiums for public and private tobacco purchasing manufacturers and tobacco transporters, and called for the purchase of "substandard tobacco." State-owned tobacco companies also actively resumed operations and vigorously carried out purchases. Public and private manufacturers from other areas came to purchase, tobacco sales improved, and sales channels for "substandard tobacco" gradually opened up. The purchase volume of state-owned tobacco companies in the entire prefecture increased by 57% in April compared to March. Since May 17, the "substandard tobacco" purchased has been increased to substandard grade three (superior-inferior, medium-inferior, and inferior-inferior). In the past, public and private manufacturers were mostly unwilling to purchase inferior tobacco, but after mobilization, they began to purchase "substandard tobacco." Thirteen private tobacco factories in Changge County organized themselves, using 50 million yuan in capital to purchase "substandard tobacco" in Chengguan and Shangqiao Town. In Xuchang City, in the middle and lower ten days of April, 569,200 jin of "substandard tobacco" were traded, accounting for 70% of the market supply. In May, 847,099 jin of "substandard tobacco" were traded, accounting for 95% of the market supply. In Yu County, 341,900 jin of "substandard tobacco" were traded, with state-owned tobacco companies purchasing 264,200 jin. The rest was purchased by private merchants. State-owned tobacco companies in Lushan, Wuyang, Linru and other places also entrusted cooperatives to vigorously carry out purchases. The sales problem of "substandard tobacco" in the entire region has basically been solved. Now, whatever is put on the market is sold. Due to the active tobacco market, tobacco firms that had once suspended business have also resumed operations. In Xuchang City, 64 scales were opened in March, and 98 scales were opened at the end of May. Xuchang's daily average transaction volume of tobacco is 120,000 jin, and the market in Xiangcheng County maintains a daily transaction volume of around 40,000 jin. In early June, public and private manufacturers stopped purchasing in the five key markets of Xuchang City, Xiangcheng County, Changge, Yu County, and Jia County, and the supply was unified by the state-owned tobacco company.

    This year, there was ample rainfall during the tobacco planting season. Now the tobacco seedlings are already half a foot tall and very robust. According to tobacco farmers, "We haven't seen such good tobacco seedlings in three years." Before the wheat harvest, most of the coal for flue-curing provided by the government as a loan has been transported (around 100,000 tons). The Xuchang and Luohe Coal Construction Companies have more than 2,000 coal-hauling ox carts every day. Tobacco farmers all say, "As long as the 'substandard tobacco' produced last year can be sold, we won't have to worry this year."

    河南省许昌专区
    “等外烟”销路问题基本解决
    编辑同志：河南省许昌专区的“等外烟”销路问题，基本上已经获得解决。许昌烟草销路，在二三月份间曾一度呈现疲滞状态。次烟无人收购，市场管理不严，不法资本家乘机压级压价来剥削烟农，并掺水掺假降低烟草规格。四月初，许昌专署紧急指示各县，开拓“等外烟”销路，加强市场管理。许昌市、襄城县、禹县、长葛县等地即先后组织力量，进行市场检查，召开公私营烟草收购厂商及烟草贩运商座谈会，号召收购“等外烟”。国营烟草公司也积极恢复业务，大力进行收购。外埠公私营厂商都来收购，烟草销路好转，“等外烟”销路逐渐打开。国营烟草公司在全专区的收购量，四月份较三月份增加百分之五十七。自五月十七日起，收购的“等外烟”已增至等外三级（上次、中次、下次）。公私厂商过去多不愿收购次烟，经过动员以后，才开始收购“等外烟”。长葛县私营烟厂十三户组织起来，用五千万元资金，在城关和尚桥镇收购“等外烟”。许昌市四月份中下两旬，成交“等外烟”五十六万九千二百斤，占上市量百分之七十。五月份成交“等外烟”八十四万七千零九十九斤，占上市量百分之九十五。禹县“等外烟”成交三十四万一千九百斤，国营烟草公司收二十六万四千二百斤。其余都为私商购进。鲁山、舞阳、临汝等地国营烟草公司也委托合作社，大力进行收购。全区“等外烟”销路问题已基本上得到了解决。现在是上市多少，成交多少。由于烟草市场成交活跃，过去曾一度停业的烟行也恢复营业。许昌市三月间开磅六十四架，五月底开磅九十八架。许昌每日成交烟草平均十二万斤，襄城县市场每日经常保持成交四万斤上下。六月上旬，公营厂商在许昌市、襄城县、长葛、禹县、郏县五个重点市场停止采购，由国营烟草公司统一供应。
    今年种烟时，雨水充足。现在烟苗已有半尺高，十分茁壮。据烟农谈：“三年来还没见过这样好的烟苗。”麦收以前，政府贷放的烤烟煤，已大部运完（在十万吨上下）。许昌、漯河煤建公司，每天有拉煤牛车二千多辆。烟农都这样说：“只要去年生产的‘等外烟’有了销路，今年就不用发愁了。”
