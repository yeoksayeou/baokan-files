Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: From the 25th to the 28th, timely rain fell widely from the north bank of the Huai River to Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe in the north, to Tianshui, Gansu in the west, and to the coast in the east. The average rainfall reached more than 25 millimeters. The area north of the Huai River and within the Yellow River basin, which suffered the most severe drought, received the heaviest rainfall. In Shandong Province, most areas of Henan and Pingyuan provinces, the southwestern part of Hebei Province, and the southern part of Shanxi Province, the rain has soaked through. Rainfall in southern and northern Chahar and southern Shaanxi and northern Sichuan provinces ranged from 20 to 60 millimeters.

Rain first fell in eastern Gansu and western Sichuan provinces starting on the 25th. On the 26th, Shaanxi, Pingyuan, and Suiyuan provinces, as well as northern Sichuan, western Shanxi, and northwestern Henan, all received rain. The center of the rainfall was in northern Sichuan, with moderate rainfall. By the 27th, the rain zone had moved northeast. In all areas north of the Huai River, including all regions of Pingyuan, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Rehe provinces, as well as southern Shaanxi, northern Sichuan, northern Jiangsu, and southern Suiyuan, the rainfall greatly increased. As of the morning of the 28th, the average rainfall in the aforementioned areas in the past two days reached over 25 millimeters. The heaviest rainfall was in Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces between the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River, with rainfall reaching over 100 millimeters (3 inches). The Hebei and Chahar areas also received 10 to 50 millimeters of rain. By 2:00 PM on the 28th, the rain had gradually subsided in Hebei Province and northern Jiangsu Province, but it had not yet stopped.

This welcome rain is most beneficial to the provinces in the Yellow River basin that have been suffering from prolonged drought. Currently, the People's Governments of Pingyuan and Henan provinces have convened emergency meetings to mobilize farmers to launch a crash planting campaign. Pingyuan Province has dispatched 15,000 cadres to the countryside. Cadres from Kaifeng, Tongxu, and Weichuan counties in the Chenliu Special District of Henan Province have braved the rain to go to the countryside to mobilize farmers to rush planting. Hengshui Special District in Hebei has decided to complete the summer planting and seedling replacement tasks within three to five days, and Cangxian Special District has launched a rush planting campaign week. Farmers in the Northwest are also actively seizing the moisture to rush plant late autumn crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 27th: Hubei Province experienced widespread rainfall on the 18th and 19th. The rainfall was heavier in the Yichang, Xiangyang, and Xiaogan Special Districts, and the drought situation in most areas can be temporarily alleviated, with some areas able to maintain it for seven days, half a month, or even up to a month. Farmers in various localities are now applying fertilizer, weeding, rushing to plant, and replanting.

Before the rain, Hubei Province had already experienced a severe drought. In Huang'an County, 40 percent of the ponds and weirs had dried up, and 1 percent of the paddy fields could not be planted with rice. In Luotian County, 30 percent of the fields in the mountainous areas had not been planted with rice seedlings. In Yingshan County, 50 percent of the seedlings had turned yellow, and 40 to 70 percent of the rice fields were without water. The early arrival of the drought this year, coupled with farmers' insufficient assessment of the drought situation, the failure to repair ponds and weirs adequately, and the lack of attention to water conservation, as well as the expansion of paddy field areas in some areas, further aggravated the severity of the drought. After this rain, all areas that could not plant rice or summer crops due to drought can now plant rice and summer crops. However, the rainfall in Huang'an, Yingshan, Luotian, and other counties with more severe drought was relatively small this time, and the drought situation cannot be alleviated. Therefore, drought resistance and rush planting are still the current urgent tasks; even in areas with heavier rainfall, we must not relax or become complacent.

Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued an emergency notice on June 28th regarding drought prevention, drought resistance, and seizing the moisture to rush planting. The full text is as follows:

Since the 27th, most areas in the Yellow River and Huai River basins have received rainfall. All localities should immediately seize the opportunity and do the following work:

        1. In areas that have received rain, launch a crash planting campaign to replant late autumn crops, and seize the time for cultivating, weeding, and applying topdressing fertilizer to cotton and major autumn crops.
    2. In areas that have not received sufficient rain, seize the moisture to rush plant and carry water for spot planting. In areas without rain, intensify the fight against drought.
    3. All areas that have received rain must prevent complacency after the rain and be vigilant against pests.
                                                            Minister Li Shucheng

### 我国大部旱区普遍落雨  中央农业部紧急通知各地趁墒抢种

    我国大部旱区普遍落雨
    中央农业部紧急通知各地趁墒抢种
    【新华社二十八日讯】二十五日到二十八日，南自淮河北岸，北至察哈尔、绥远和热河，西达甘肃省天水，东至海岸，普遍喜降时雨，雨量平均达到二十五公厘以上。受干旱最重的淮河以北黄河流域地区，雨下得最大。山东全省，河南、平原大部地区，河北省西南部、山西省南部雨已下透，察南、察北和陕西南部、四川北部地区，降雨二十到六十公厘不等。
    二十五日起，甘肃东部和四川西部地区首先下雨。二十六日，陕西、平原、绥远各省和四川北部、山西西部、河南西北部都下了雨。降雨中心是在四川北部，雨量适中。到二十七日，雨区向东北移动。淮河以北各地，包括平原、河南、河北、山东、山西、察哈尔、热河各省全部地区以及陕西南部、四川北部、江苏北部、绥远南部等地，雨量都大有增加。截至二十八日晨止，上述地区两天内，平均雨量达二十五公厘以上。降雨最多的是黄河下游和淮河之间的河南、平原、山东等省，雨量大到一百公厘（三寸）以上。河北、察哈尔一带也下了十到五十公厘。到二十八日下午二时止，河北省和江苏北部地区，雨已逐渐小下来，但还未停。
    这场喜雨对久旱不雨的黄河流域各省作用最大。现在，平原、河南等省的人民政府都召开了紧急会议，动员农民突击抢种。平原省已派遣了一万五千干部下乡。河南陈留专区开封、通许、洧川等县干部都冒雨出发，下乡动员农民抢种。河北衡水专区已决定三、五天内完成夏种补苗任务，沧县专区已展开了一个抢种的突击周。西北各地农民也正积极借墒抢种晚秋。
   【新华社武汉二十七日电】湖北省各地在十八、九日普降喜雨，宜昌、襄阳、孝感专区雨量较大，大部地区旱象可暂时解除，有的地区可以保持七天、半月多至一个月。现各地农民正追肥除草、抢种补种。
    雨前，湖北省各地已呈现严重旱象。黄安县百分之四十的塘、堰已干，百分之一的水田不能插秧。罗田县山区有百分之三十的田未插上秧。英山县百分之五十的秧苗已黄，百分之四十到七十的秧田绝水。今年旱期早临，农民对旱情估计不足，塘堰没修好，也不注意节省用水；加之部分地区扩大了水田面积，更增加了旱象的严重性。此次雨后，凡因旱不能插秧、夏播的均能插秧、夏播。但旱象较严重的黄安、英山、罗田等县这次雨量较小，还不能解除旱象，故抗旱抢种仍是当前的严重任务；就是落雨较大的地区，也决不能松懈麻痹。
   【新华社二十八日讯】中央人民政府农业部六月二十八日发布防旱、抗旱趁墒抢种紧急通知，原文如下：
    自二十七日起，黄河、淮河流域大部落雨，各地应即抓紧时机，作好下列工作：
        一、已落雨地区，突击抢种补种晚秋作物，抓紧棉花及大秋作物的中耕、锄苗、施追肥。
    二、未透雨地区趁墒抢种，担水点种。无雨地区，抓紧抗旱斗争。
    三、落雨地区均要防止雨后麻痹，警惕虫害。
