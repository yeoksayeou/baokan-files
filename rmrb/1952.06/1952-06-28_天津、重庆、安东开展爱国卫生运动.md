    Since the launch of the patriotic health campaign in Tianjin in late March, significant improvements have been made in urban environmental hygiene and the health conditions of people from all walks of life.
    The patriotic health campaign in Tianjin is being carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. From late March to mid-April, the city conducted health publicity and education work. This stage mainly involved factories, troops, government agencies, schools, hospitals, and various people's organizations and health organizations using health exhibitions, small-scale seminars, radio broadcasts, and film screenings, closely integrated with the opposition to the U.S. imperialists' bacteriological warfare, to make citizens from all walks of life realize that improving environmental sanitation is not only necessary to protect people's health, but also a practical action to counter the U.S. aggressors' bacteriological warfare. Starting in mid-April, the campaign entered the summer cleaning and hygiene phase. This stage focused on launching a city-wide mosquito eradication campaign and strengthening food management. Thanks to the active participation of the city's people, the summer cleaning and hygiene work achieved great results. According to statistics from May, more than 80 percent of the city's residents participated in the general cleaning and hygiene campaign. All districts in the city mobilized more than 210,000 workers, soldiers, cadres, students, and citizens to participate in the work of filling and disinfecting water pits. Most of the larger sewage pits in all districts of the city have been filled or disinfected, totaling 994, covering an area of more than 4,000 mu; 10,149 tree holes were blocked, and more than 410,000 rat holes were blocked; the city also cleared 26,150 cubic meters of garbage accumulated over the years, relocated 428 manure factories, and built 491 public toilets.
    In terms of food and cold food management, there are currently 3,124 cold food shops and street vendors approved to operate in the city, and all products have been tested and qualified by the Public Health Bureau. Cold food manufacturing shops are equipped with dedicated manufacturing rooms. In terms of drinking water disinfection, the municipal government has set up 17 drinking water disinfection stations and 7 branch stations in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and eleventh marginal areas without tap water equipment, so that citizens in these areas can drink clean water.
    Participants in this patriotic health campaign include workers, peasants, soldiers, government cadres, students, citizens, etc., who have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in their work. For example, the hygiene organization in Shude Lane in the Ninth District mobilized more than 10,000 residents and filled a stinking water pit of more than 20 mu and eight feet deep, which had existed for 60 years, in 14 days. One hundred and seventy-two boat dwellers living on the Weijin River and along the coast used 42 barges to clear 115 tons of garbage and 1.5 tons of bricks from Weijin River, Balitai, Wujiayao, Tonglou, Liulitai, and Wandezhuang in one day. In addition, many young children in various districts also actively participated in this movement. For example, more than 500 children in Xiyuzhuang in the Ninth District organized a fly-catching team, which has killed more than 500,000 flies since the start of the campaign.
    Through this movement, the vast number of citizens in Tianjin have established good habits of paying attention to hygiene and cleanliness. More than 95 percent of the residents within the jurisdiction of the Shizijie Police Station in the Second District have included cleaning and hygiene work in the patriotic pact. Tens of thousands of hygiene groups throughout the city are conscientiously protecting the cleanliness and hygiene of streets and alleys. Many residents automatically report merchants selling unclean food.
    In order to further promote the patriotic health campaign in Tianjin and eliminate the vectors of infectious diseases, the municipal health work leading body has arranged a city-wide mosquito eradication and prevention inspection starting from June 15; and starting from this day, a fly eradication campaign has been launched throughout the city.

    Chongqing has achieved success in launching the summer patriotic health campaign. From April to May, the city mobilized more than 80 percent of the residents in urban and suburban areas to conduct a large-scale general cleaning. According to incomplete statistics, the city has dredged more than 5,800 ditches, cleared more than 250,000 dan of garbage, and more than 40,000 dan of feces and sewage. In addition, the city has also renovated toilets, removed weeds, and carried out work to eliminate flies and mice.
    Before liberation, Chongqing was a rugged and dirty mountain city. After more than two years of municipal construction and cleaning and hygiene campaigns since liberation, the environmental hygiene has undergone unprecedented changes. This year, due to the large-scale launch of the patriotic health campaign, the urban area is cleaner than in previous years after entering summer. The effect of fly eradication is significant, with more than 90 million flies caught. Few flies are now found in the urban area. The Longmenhao area on the south bank, which used to be full of slag and weeds, has been cleaned up particularly well this year. The vicinity of many slaughterhouses along the river is no longer filled with foul smells. The vast majority of the catering industry and vendors have added glass cabinets and screens. The city has also established more than 200 drinking water disinfection stations to disinfect drinking river water and well water.
    The habit of loving cleanliness and hygiene is gradually being cultivated among all citizens. Some areas and streets are formulating regular patriotic health covenants, and more than 60 percent of the areas have established a system of weekly cleaning and regular inspection. Many residents have dismantled and washed bedding and filled in rat holes in their homes.
    The reason why this patriotic health campaign can achieve great results in a short period of time is because the vast number of citizens have raised their awareness of patriotic health work. They have realized that this is one of the effective ways to defeat the U.S. imperialists' bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. After the campaign was launched, the city's residents showed a high degree of work enthusiasm. In the fly eradication work in Baoshan Temple Street, each resident group exchanged challenge letters and reported good news, launching a competition. A military family member in Dongshenglou Street gave the residents of the whole street a letter from his son sent from Korea describing how the volunteers bravely resisted the U.S. imperialist bacteriological warfare for reading and discussion. This street immediately launched a warm patriotic health work competition. Women also actively carried stones and mud and participated in dredging the sewers. In this movement, the residents demonstrated creativity. For example, shop workers created a method of using rubber bands tied to bamboo poles to shoot flies at high places; some residents created simple and effective methods of catching rats.
    The experience of launching this patriotic health campaign shows that the leaders at all levels in the urban area attaching importance to and deeply mobilizing the masses is the main key to doing a good job in health work. Before launching the campaign, Chongqing first carried out extensive publicity mobilization and organizational work. The city has a total of more than 1,100 publicity groups, implementing a fixed "contracting method" to conduct in-depth publicity to residents. The propagandists of various agencies, the slide teams and propaganda teams of various schools in the urban area also focused on patriotic health and opposing the U.S. imperialist bacteriological warfare. Newspapers and blackboards generally introduced various methods of preventing epidemics and simple cleaning and hygiene. The municipal-level organs also organized health visiting teams to conduct in-depth inspections of various units. Residents also inspected and urged each other. The cadres of each public security police station and section personally took the lead in the work. The Municipal Health Bureau prepared many tools and medicines in a timely manner. Therefore, this mass health movement was quickly launched.

    The people of Andong City, who are standing at the front line of the anti-bacterial warfare, have launched a widespread and in-depth patriotic health campaign for several months and have achieved great results. At the beginning of launching this campaign, the city carried out a large-scale publicity campaign. In the two months since mid-March, 554 street propagandists were organized to hold more than 4,500 small-scale publicity meetings among citizens, and 87 report meetings were held, with more than 52,000 listeners. At the same time, various mass propaganda organizations with the propaganda network as the leading core, such as reading groups and radio listening groups, also fully played their role. In the past three months, nearly 100,000 citizens have watched the patriotic health programs performed by various professional or amateur theater troupes. Through this series of publicity activities, the patriotism of the city's people has been greatly strengthened, and the hatred for the U.S. imperialists who spread bacteria has been aroused; the paralysis that existed in some of the masses has been overcome, making them realize the importance of carrying out the patriotic health campaign; and the level of health science knowledge has been improved, and a new atmosphere of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene has been established.
    After a large-scale publicity campaign, a mass sanitation cleaning campaign was launched throughout the city. Almost 70 to 80 percent of the city's residents participated in the cleaning every day. Under the slogan of "Furniture turned upside down, no dust in the room," every household moved all the furniture in the house out of the house, and some even moved it to the Yalu River to thoroughly sweep, wash, brush, and sunbathe. The citizens also put forward specific standards for doing a good job in indoor and outdoor sanitation: "Five Cleans" (referring to cleaning the ceiling, walls, floors, doors and windows, boxes and cabinets), "Eight Bright" (referring to shining the upper and lower, left and right, front and back, inside and outside of the boxes and cabinets), "Two Flat" (referring to filling the land inside and outside the house) and "Four Covers" (referring to covering the water tanks, pots and pans, spittoons, and toilets). This standard has been jointly observed by all streets and households. While doing a good job in household sanitation, the citizens also actively participated in the cleaning of public places. Many people automatically dedicated their labor and vehicles, and did not hesitate to work hard. With the efforts of all citizens, by the end of May, the city had removed more than 40,000 tons of garbage, dredged more than 300 large and small ditches, excavated more than 74,000 square meters of silt, and renovated and repaired roads for more than 2,900 meters. Now the city has eliminated garbage, the ditches are unobstructed, and the roads are smooth, effectively preventing the breeding of various disease vectors and making the city more tidy and beautiful.
    On the basis of the great achievements in sanitation cleaning, the city carried out a large-scale disinfection and insect extermination campaign in late May. After disinfection, the disease vectors such as flies and mosquitoes in the city have been greatly reduced and are gradually tending to disappear. For example, in the past, the city's slaughterhouse, which had the most flies, could stick an average of 50 or 60 flies a day with a flypaper before disinfection, and after five days of disinfection, there were no flies. In Zhenjiangshan Park in the town, there were 40 or 50 mosquito larvae in each spoonful of water in the past. After disinfection, no mosquito larvae were found after five consecutive days of inspection. The vast number of citizens praised this highly, saying: "The patriotic health campaign has brought a new atmosphere to Andong City."
    Now, the patriotic health campaign in Andong City is developing in the direction of regularization. More than 90 percent of the city's residents have signed patriotic health covenants, or revised patriotic covenants with health content. The Andong Municipal People's Government recently announced that it will designate Saturday afternoon as "People's Hygiene Day," calling on all citizens to regularly clean and maintain the habit of cleanliness and hygiene.

    天津、重庆、安东开展爱国卫生运动
    天津市自三月下旬开展爱国卫生运动以来，城市环境卫生和各界人民的卫生状况已有显著改进。
    天津市的爱国卫生运动是有计划有步骤地展开的。全市自三月下旬至四月中旬进行了卫生的宣传教育工作。这一阶段主要是由各工厂、部队、机关、学校、医院及各人民团体和卫生组织，利用卫生展览会、小型座谈会、电台广播及放映电影等，紧密结合反对美帝国主义细菌战来进行宣传，使各界市民认识到：改善环境卫生不仅为保障人民身体健康所必需，而且是反击美国侵略者细菌战的实际行动。四月中旬起，即转入夏季清洁卫生运动阶段。这一阶段，是在全市普遍展开灭蚊运动及加强饮食管理工作。由于全市人民积极行动，使夏季清洁卫生工作得到很大成绩，据五月份的统计：全市有百分之八十以上的市民都参加了清洁卫生大扫除。全市各区共动员了二十一万余工人、战士、干部、学生和市民参加了填平和消毒水坑的工作，全市各区较大的污水坑一般均已填平或消了毒，共九百九十四个，面积达四千余亩；堵塞树洞一万零一百四十九个，堵塞鼠洞四十一万多个；全市并清除了多年来积存的垃圾二万六千一百五十土方，迁移粪厂四百二十八处，修建公共厕所四百九十一所。
    在饮食及冷食管理方面，目前全市被批准开业的冷食店铺和小摊贩共有三千一百二十四家，制品都是经公共卫生局化验合格的。制造冷食的店铺都设备了专用制造室。在饮水消毒方面，市人民政府分别在没有自来水设备的二、三、四、五、六、八、九、十一等边缘区，设立了十七个饮水消毒站和七个分站，使这一带的市民能够饮用洁净的水。
    参加这次爱国卫生运动的，包括工人、农民、战士、机关干部、学生、市民等，他们在各项工作中发挥了高度的积极性。如九区树德里卫生组织动员了居民一万多人，在十四天内填平了已有六十年的二十多亩大、八尺深的一个臭水坑。住在卫津河水上和沿岸的一百七十二个船民，用四十二只槽船，在一天之内清除了沿卫津河、八里台、吴家窑、佟楼、六里台、万德庄等地的一百十五吨垃圾和一吨半砖头。此外，各区许多少年儿童也积极地投入这一运动。如九区西于庄五百多个儿童组织了一个捕蝇队，从运动开始至今，已灭蝇达五十多万个。
    天津市广大市民通过这一运动已树立了讲卫生、爱清洁的良好习惯。二区十字街派出所界内百分之九十五以上的居民都把清洁卫生工作列入了爱国公约。全市有上万个卫生小组认真地保护着大街小巷的清洁卫生。许多居民自动检举贩卖不清洁食物的商人。
    为了进一步开展天津市的爱国卫生运动，消灭传染病的媒介，市卫生工作领导机构自六月十五日起布置了全市灭蚊防蚊大检查；并从这一天起，在全市范围内展开了灭蝇运动。    （新华社）

    重庆市开展夏令爱国卫生运动已获得成绩。全市在四月到五月份内，城区和郊区发动了百分之八十以上的居民进行了一次规模很大的清洁大扫除。据不完全的统计：全市已疏通沟渠五千八百多条，清除垃圾二十五万多担、粪便污水四万多担。此外，全市还修整了厕所，铲除了杂草，进行了扑灭苍蝇、老鼠等工作。
    重庆市在解放前是一个崎岖污秽的山城，解放后，经过两年多来的市政建设和清洁卫生运动，环境卫生已空前改观。今年由于大规模开展爱国卫生运动，入夏以后的市区更比往年清洁。灭蝇成效显著，共捕蝇九千多万个，现在市区内已很少发现苍蝇了。南岸龙门浩一带过去渣滓满地，杂草丛生，今年都整理得特别干净。沿江许多屠宰场的附近已不再臭气四溢。饮食业和摊贩绝大多数都添置了玻璃柜和纱罩。全市还成立了二百多个饮水消毒站，对饮用的河水和井水进行消毒工作。
    爱好清洁卫生的风气正在全体市民中逐渐养成。有的地区和街道正在订立经常性的爱国卫生公约，百分之六十以上的地区都建立了每周扫除一次和定期检查的制度。许多居民拆洗了被褥，填塞了住屋的鼠洞。    这次爱国卫生运动能够在短期内收效很大，是由于广大市民提高了对爱国卫生工作的认识，他们已认识到这是战胜美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的有效办法之一。在运动开展起来以后，全市居民表现了高度的工作积极性。宝善寺街在灭蝇工作中，各居民组互相递挑战书，传捷报，展开竞赛。东升楼街一位军属把他儿子从朝鲜寄来的叙述志愿军如何英勇地抗击美帝国主义细菌战的信件，交给全街居民阅读和讨论。这条街便立即展开了热烈的爱国卫生工作竞赛。妇女们也积极担石抬泥，并参加疏通阴沟工作。在这次运动中，居民们发挥了创造性。如店员工人创造了利用在竹竿上系橡皮圈的办法，射击高处的苍蝇；有的居民创造了简易有效的捕鼠方法。
    这次开展爱国卫生运动的经验证明：市区的各级领导重视与深入发动群众是做好卫生工作的主要关键。重庆市在开展运动前首先进行了广泛的宣传动员和组织工作，全市共有一千一百多个宣传组，实行固定的“包干法”，向居民进行深入的宣传。各机关的宣传员，市区各学校的幻灯队和宣传队也以爱国卫生和反对美帝国主义进行细菌战为宣传中心。报纸和黑板报普遍地介绍了各种预防疫病和简易的清洁卫生办法。市级机关并组织卫生参观队到各单位深入检查。居民之间也彼此检查督促。各公安派出所和段上的干部都亲自带头工作。市卫生局及时地准备了许多工具和药品。因此，这一群众性的卫生运动才迅速地发动起来。（新华社）

    站在反细菌战前线的安东市人民，几个月来广泛深入地展开爱国卫生运动，已获得很大成绩。在开展这一运动之初，全市曾进行了大规模的宣传工作。自三月中旬起的两个月内，组织了五百五十四名街道宣传员，在市民中召开了四千五百多次小型宣传会，举行了八十七次报告会，听众达五万二千多人。在这同时，以宣传网为领导核心的各种群众宣传组织，如读报组和广播收听组等，也充分地发挥了作用。三个月来，有将近十万的市民观看了各职业剧团或业余剧团所演出的宣传爱国卫生的节目，通过这一系列的宣传活动，大大地加强了全市人民爱国主义的觉悟，和激起了对散布细菌的美帝国主义的仇恨；克服了部分群众中存在着的麻痹思想，使他们认识到开展爱国卫生运动的重要性；并提高了卫生科学知识水平，树立爱清洁、讲卫生的新风气。
    在大规模的宣传活动以后，群众性的卫生清扫运动就在全市范围内开展起来。全市几乎每天都有百分之七十到八十的市民参加清扫，他们在“家具大翻身，室内无灰尘”的口号下，家家户户都把屋内所有家具搬出屋外，有的甚至搬到鸭绿江边，彻底进行扫、洗、刷、晒。市民们更提出了搞好室内、室外卫生的具体标准：“五净”（指扫净天棚、墙壁、地板、门窗、箱柜）、“八光”（指擦光箱柜的上下、左右、前后、里外）、“两平”（指填平屋内和院内的土地）和“四盖”（指水缸、锅盆、痰盂、便所上面加盖）。这个标准已为各街、各户所共同遵守。在搞好家庭卫生的同时，市民们还积极地参加了公共场所的清扫工作。许多人自动献工、献车，不辞劳苦。在全体市民的努力下，到五月下旬为止，全市已清除垃圾四万多吨，疏通大小水沟三百多条，挖出淤泥七万四千多平方公尺，翻修和补修道路长达二千九百多公尺。现在全市垃圾消除，水沟畅通，道路平坦，有效地防止了各种疾病媒介昆虫的滋生，市容也更整洁美观。
    在卫生清扫工作已获得很大成绩的基础上，全市自五月下旬又进行了大规模的消毒灭虫工作。经过消毒以后，全市苍蝇、蚊子等疾病媒介昆虫大为减少，并且逐渐趋于绝迹。例如过去苍蝇最多的市屠宰场，在消毒前，用一张黏蝇纸平均一天可黏五、六十个苍蝇，消毒五天之后就一个苍蝇也没有了。在该市镇江山公园里，过去每勺水有四五十个孑孓，消毒后一连检查了五天都没有发现孑孓。广大市民对此盛加赞扬，他们说：“爱国卫生运动给安东市带来了一个新气象。”
    现在，安东市爱国卫生运动正在向经常化的方向发展。全市已有百分之九十以上的居民订立了爱国卫生公约，或修订了具有卫生内容的爱国公约。安东市人民政府最近宣布将每星期六的下午订为“人民卫生日”，号召全体市民经常进行清扫，保持清洁卫生的习惯。（新华社）
