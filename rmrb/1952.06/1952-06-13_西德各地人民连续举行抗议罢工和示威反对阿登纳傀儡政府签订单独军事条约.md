Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: Berlin dispatch: The movement against the separate signing of a military "General Treaty" between the United States and the Adenauer puppet government is growing stronger in West Germany.

Workers in various parts of West Germany have been continuously holding protest strikes and demonstrations against Adenauer's militarist policies. On June 4th, 10,000 workers in Worms went on strike for two hours to protest the so-called "factory law" of the "General Treaty" implemented in the factories. During the strike, all public transportation in Worms was paralyzed. On June 5th, transport workers and staff in Hamburg, West Germany's largest port, went on strike against the "General Treaty" and the "factory law," paralyzing traffic throughout the city. On the same day, tens of thousands of workers in industrial cities in North Rhine-Westphalia also held strikes and large-scale demonstrations to protest the "factory law." 15,000 workers and staff in Solingen, 8,000 workers in Hamm, and thousands of workers in Wanne-Eickel all stopped work and held protest meetings. In Dortmund, Bochum, Aachen and other places, workers in twenty large factories also held protest strikes against Adenauer's policies. On June 6th, 21,000 workers in Remscheid and Gräbeck in North Rhine-Westphalia held strikes and demonstrations to protest the "General Treaty" and the "factory law." On the same day, 3,000 workers and staff in seven other factories in the state also held short protest strikes. According to statistics from the West German Trade Union Confederation, since May 15th, a total of 700,000 workers in North Rhine-Westphalia have held symbolic strikes and mass demonstrations, and a total of 70,000 workers in 103 factories have held formal strikes.

Many youth organizations in West Germany have issued statements opposing the Adenauer government's plan to forcibly mobilize young people to join the West German army. In a statement, the Social Democratic Youth Organization "Eagle Troupe" firmly opposed forced mobilization and stated that if the Bonn government intends to implement mobilization at all costs, the "Eagle Troupe" will never accept such measures without resistance. The "German Christian Evangelical Youth" organization also issued a declaration opposing forced mobilization.

The "Association for the Defense of Peace in Europe," organized by prominent figures in West Germany, held its first national congress in Frankfurt from June 7th to 8th. The congress passed a letter to members of the Bonn parliament, demanding that they vote against the "General Treaty." The congress also unanimously passed a statement demanding that the Adenauer government strive to resolve the German question through four-power negotiations. The statement also pointed out that a pan-German constitutional national assembly must be established by the Germans themselves, and a comprehensive peace treaty involving all relevant countries must be striven for. At the last meeting of the congress, Heinemann, the former Minister of Interior of the Bonn government, delivered a speech. He said that the purpose of the separate military treaty was to split Germany, and the people did not want this treaty. His words were met with a storm of applause from the audience. Heinemann called on the residents of West Germany to fight for the restoration of German unity and against the separate military treaty in accordance with the constitution.

Under the pressure of the powerful protest movement of the West German people, even the governments of some West German states have declared that under no circumstances will they try to prevent the implementation of the separate military treaty, and if the treaty is illegally ratified, they will not comply with orders issued under the treaty, because this treaty was signed by Adenauer against the will of the German people.

Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: TASS, Moscow, June 9th: "Pravda" published Naumov's Berlin dispatch, commenting on the reaction of the West German bourgeoisie to the so-called "General Treaty." Naumov wrote: It is worth noting that after a detailed study of this treaty, even bourgeois figures have expressed dissatisfaction. Moreover, they are also greatly alarmed by the scale of the people's movement against the "General Treaty." Many of them previously supported Adenauer's divisive policies, and now they are rushing to show their support for German unification.

Certain bourgeois newspapers, such as the "Aachen News" and the "Düsseldorf Advance," also emphasized that this separate treaty consolidated West Germany's dependence on the United States in a blatant and shameless manner. Previously, many people were deceived by Adenauer's deceptive propaganda, thinking that the "General Treaty" would gradually lead Germany to unification and consolidate European peace, but now the content of this separate treaty has awakened them from their dreams. Today, not only advanced patriotic people, but also broad sections of the West German bourgeoisie and ordinary men and women believe that this Bonn deal is a fatal step towards the permanent division of Germany, and that it deepens the danger of a new war. For example, the "Nuremberg News" pointed out that the Bonn parliament's approval of the Bonn separate treaty would have fatal consequences for Germany.

Many West German bourgeois newspapers are criticizing Adenauer's adventurous policy, which obviously violates national interests, and they are doing so with increasing intensity and determination. The West German Free Democratic Party newspaper "Weser Courier" revealed that even among Adenauer's close associates, there are now many people who oppose his policies. Some bourgeois newspapers have even called on the people to stop the ratification of the separate treaty, which shows how alarmed they are. Many newspapers are warning the members of the Bonn parliament to pay attention to how serious a responsibility they will bear to the people if they participate in this action of betraying national interests.

Naumov concluded by pointing out that the movement against the military "General Treaty" in West Germany is growing and expanding day by day, its ranks are constantly expanding, and people from various social strata in West Germany, who differ greatly from each other, are constantly joining this movement.

    西德各地人民连续举行抗议罢工和示威反对阿登纳傀儡政府签订单独军事条约
    【新华社十一日讯】柏林消息：西德境内抗议美国与阿登纳傀儡政府单独签订军事性的“一般性条约”的运动，正在日益壮大。
    西德各地工人连续不断地举行抗议性的罢工与示威，反对阿登纳的军国主义政策。六月四日，沃姆斯一万工人罢工两小时，抗议在工厂中实行“一般性条约”的所谓“工厂法”，在罢工时，沃姆斯所有的公共交通都陷于停顿。六月五日，西德最大港口汉堡的运输工人与职员举行罢工，反对“一般性条约”及“工厂法”，罢工时全市交通中断。在同一天中，北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州各工业城市的数万工人也举行了罢工及盛大的示威，抗议“工厂法”。索林根的一万五千名工人与职员、哈姆的八千工人、万纳—埃克尔的数千工人都停止了工作，举行抗议大会。在多特蒙德、波鸿与亚琛等地也有二十个大工厂的工人举行了反对阿登纳政策的抗议性罢工。六月六日，北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的莱姆夏德与格拉贝克有两万一千名工人举行了罢工和示威大会，抗议“一般性条约”和“工厂法”。同日，该州其他七个工厂中的三千名工人与职员也举行了短时间的抗议罢工。据西德工会联合会统计：自从五月十五日以来，在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州共已有七十万工人举行了象征性罢工及群众示威，共有一百零三个工厂七万多工人举行正式罢工。
    西德许多青年组织纷纷发表声明，反对阿登纳政府企图强迫动员青年加入西德军队的计划。社会民主党青年组织“鹰团”的声明中坚决反对强迫动员，并表示倘若波恩政府打算不顾一切来实行动员，“鹰团”决不会毫无抵抗地接受这种措施。“德国基督教福音青年”组织也发表宣言，反对强迫动员。
    西德社会名流组织的“保卫欧洲和平协会”于六月七日至八日在法兰克福举行第一次全国代表大会。大会通过一项告波恩议会议员书，要求他们投票反对“一般性条约”。大会又一致通过一项声明，要求阿登纳政府应努力通过四国谈判来解决德国问题，声明并指出必须以德国人自己的力量争取成立一个全德立宪国民议会，争取缔结有一切有关国家参加的全面和约。在代表大会最后一次会议上，前波恩政府内政部长海纳曼发表演说。他说，单独军事条约的目的在于分裂德国，人民不要这个条约。他这句话博得听众暴风雨般的掌声。海纳曼号召西德居民根据宪法为恢复德国的统一、反对单独军事条约而斗争。
    在西德人民强大抗议运动的压力下，甚至西德若干州的政府也已声明：在任何情况下，它们都将努力阻止单独军事条约的实施，如果这个条约被非法批准，它们将不遵守根据这个条约发出的命令，因为这个条约是阿登纳违背着德国人民的意志签订的。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：“真理报”发表瑙莫夫的柏林通讯，评述西德资产阶级对所谓“一般性条约”的反应。瑙莫夫写道：值得注意的是，对这个条约详尽地研究一下之后，连资产阶级人士也都纷纷表示不满。而且，他们看到人民反抗“一般性条约”运动的规模之大，也大大感到惊慌了。他们里面很多人以前是支持阿登纳的分裂政策的，现在也都匆匆表示他们拥护德国统一了。
    某些资产阶级报纸，如“亚琛新闻”及“杜塞尔多夫前进报”等，也强调指出，这个单独条约以公然无耻的方式巩固了西德对美国的从属地位。以前许多人受了阿登纳欺骗宣传的影响，以为“一般性条约”使德国日渐走向统一，使欧洲和平获得巩固，现在这个单独条约的内容使他们从梦中惊醒了过来。今天，不要说先进的爱国人民，就是广大的西德资产阶级人士和普通的男女也都认为这次波恩交易是使德国永远分裂的致命的一步，认为这加深了新战争的危险。例如“纽伦堡新闻”就指出波恩议会批准波恩单独条约会给德国造成致命的后果。
    西德许多资产阶级报纸都在斥责阿登纳这个显然违反民族利益的冒险政策，而且愈来愈激烈和坚决。西德自由民主党的报纸“威悉快报”透露，就是在阿登纳的亲信人物中，现在也有很多人反对他的政策。有的资产阶级报纸甚至号召人民制止批准单独条约，由此也可以看出他们是多么惊慌了。许多报纸都警告波恩议会的议员，要他们注意如果他们参加这个出卖民族利益的行动，他们就要对人民负有多么严重的责任。
    瑙莫夫最后指出：目前，西德反对军事性的“一般性条约”的运动在一天天地成长和壮大，它的队伍在不断扩大，不断地有西德各个相差十分悬殊的社会阶层的人们参加到这个运动的行列里去。
