Economic Briefs

    ▲ After the Shimen Iron and Steel Team of the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine set a new national record of digging 35 meters of stone roadway in one day and night on April 30, they continued to summarize their experiences, improve their technology and working conditions, and recently created two new national records in a row. On May 24, they dug 37.5 meters of stone roadway in one day and night, and on May 30, they dug 34.6 meters of stone roadway in 19 hours. The new record on May 30 was the seventh national record created by the Iron and Steel Team since November last year. This new record more than doubled the first national record in November last year.
    ▲ In the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, learning and promoting advanced working methods has become a mass upsurge. In mid-May, workers throughout the factory created 174 advanced operating methods and improvements to tools and labor organization. The task for the entire month was overfulfilled by 10.2 percent. The total output value was equivalent to 55 percent of the production task for the first quarter of this year.
    ▲ The "bond system" (the content of the bond stipulated that capitalists could dismiss workers at will, and workers had no right to appeal), which capitalists used to bind workers before the liberation of Shanghai, has been abolished in most private enterprises in Shanghai after the "Five-Anti" movement; this is one of the major gains of the Shanghai workers in the "Five-Anti" struggle. The abolition of the bond system generally took place at the "Five-Anti" summary meeting. When the capitalists returned the bonds to the workers and burned them on the spot, the workers were extremely excited.
    ▲ Spring cocoons in East China have been on the market, and the state-owned silk companies and cooperatives in the region have successively started purchasing them at the end of May and the beginning of June. This year, East China has generally had a bumper harvest of spring cocoons, with a significant increase in both unit yield and quality. Generally, each sheet of silkworm paper produces more than 45 catties of cocoons, and some good areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang average about 50 catties. The region has made preparations for the purchase of spring cocoons early this year. A total of 560 cocoon collection stations have been set up in the cocoon-producing areas, and more than 31,000 cadres have been organized to carry out cocoon collection work.
    ▲ All the staff of the Nanjing Municipal Company of the China National Grain Corporation, when the grain weevils began to be active, universally sprayed insecticide on the stored grain and grain storage equipment, and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected the empty warehouses. For example, in the Fourth Warehouse, which is an old-fashioned house, the director of the warehouse took the lead, and everyone worked together to completely eliminate the hibernating insect cocoons and eggs in all the wall cracks, cleaned the dust and dirt on the beams and columns and floors, and sprayed insecticide powder. After this insecticidal work, all the grain weevils were eliminated. Due to the active improvement of grain protection methods and working systems, the grain has safely passed through the initial mold period this year.
    ▲ The mass pest control work in rice seedling fields in Western Sichuan has achieved great results. As of the end of May, according to preliminary statistics from 19 counties including Xindu, a total of more than 247.7 million rice stem borers and other pests have been captured and killed, and nearly 30 million pieces of rice stem borer eggs have been collected. It is estimated that this can reduce grain losses by 40 million catties, which is greatly beneficial to this year's patriotic production increase campaign.
    ▲ Hebei Province has designated June as the agricultural technology dissemination month. The province has now transferred 2,000 technicians from agricultural science and technology departments such as provincial, prefectural, and county farms and agricultural colleges and senior agricultural vocational schools to form ten dissemination teams, which will go to various counties to cooperate with the local people's governments to carry out technical extension work.

    经济简讯
    ▲国营萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队工人在四月三十日创造一昼夜掘进石巷三十五公尺的全国新纪录后，继续不断总结经验，改进技术与工作条件，最近又连续创造两次全国新纪录。五月二十四日一昼夜他们掘进石巷三十七点五公尺，五月三十日十九小时他们又掘进石巷三十四点六公尺。五月三十日的新纪录是钢铁队工人从去年十一月以来创造的第七次全国新纪录，这次新纪录超过去年十一月的第一次全国纪录一倍以上。
    ▲国营上海电机厂工人学习和推广先进工作法已成为群众性的热潮。在五月中，全厂工人创造先进操作方法、改进工具和劳动组织有一百七十四件之多。全月超额百分之十点二完成任务。生产总值相当于今年第一季度生产任务的百分之五十五。
    ▲上海解放以前资本家用以束缚工人的“保单制度”（保的内容规定了资本家可以任意解雇，而工人没有申辩权），经过“五反”运动后，已在上海大部分的私营企业中废除；这是上海工人在“五反”斗争中的重大收获之一。废除保单制度，一般都是在“五反”总结大会上进行的。当资本家把一张张保单退回给工人予以当场焚毁时，工人情绪极为兴奋。
    ▲华东区春茧已上市，该区国营蚕丝公司和合作社已于五月底和六月初先后开秤收购。今年华东地区春茧普遍丰收，单位产量和质量都大为提高，一般产量每张蚕纸产茧都在四十五斤以上，江苏、浙江某些好的地区平均达五十斤左右。该区今年对春茧收购工作早已做好准备。在产茧区共设立了五百六十个收茧站，并组织了三万一千多个干部进行收茧工作。
    ▲中国粮食公司南京市公司全体职工，在目前仓虫开始活动的时候，他们就把存粮及储粮用具普遍喷射杀虫药剂，把空仓加以彻底打扫和消毒。如第四仓库是老式住房，就由仓库主任带头，大家一齐动手，把所有墙缝中潜伏的虫茧、虫卵完全肃清，把梁柱和地板上的灰垢打扫干净，喷射上杀虫粉，经过这一番杀虫工作，就把仓虫全部消灭。由于积极改进护粮方法和工作制度，使今年粮食安全度过了初霉期。
    ▲川西区群众性的秧田治虫工作已获得很大成绩。截至五月底止，据新都等十九个县初步统计，共捕杀螟蛾和其他害虫二亿四千七百多万只，采螟卵近三千万块。估计可减少粮食损失四千万斤，大大有益于今年爱国增产运动。
    ▲河北省规定六月份为农业技术传授月。现在该省已从省、专区、县农场和农学院、高级农业职业学校等农业科学技术部门抽调了两千名技术人员，组成十个传授队分赴各县，协同当地人民政府展开技术推广工作。
