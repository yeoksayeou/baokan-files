To the Editor: Xiao Danniang is a top labor model elected by the first Labor Model Representative Conference in Feidong County. Before liberation, she suffered greatly because she had no land. After liberation, during the land reform, she actively fought against the local tyrants and landlords, distributing land and grain selflessly, and working actively and responsibly. Therefore, she was elected as the director of the township women's federation and a member of the district and county women's federations. People respected and loved her, and Xiao Danniang's name spread everywhere.

Xiao Danniang loves the motherland. At the beginning of March last year, when the district held a people's representative conference, she recognized the significance of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the ambition of the American robbers. She recalled the brutality of the Japanese devils and saw her own happy life now, with children and grandchildren all around, and no lack of land, houses, or cattle. Therefore, before the meeting was over, she ran home overnight to mobilize her son to join the Volunteer Army. She led her children to thresh wheat in the summer, earning 30,000 yuan to donate. Her family paid off the 700 catties of public grain they owed in two installments. She would preach the principle that "only with a country can there be a home" to everyone she met.

After the initial completion of land reform, she responded to Chairman Mao's call and joined a mutual aid team. Under her influence of taking the lead in enduring hardship and setting an example, their mutual aid team became increasingly consolidated. Her 3.7 mu of wheat fields used to yield 6 shi of barley, but last year they yielded 8 shi.

She is always concerned about the peasant brothers who have difficulties in their lives. When Fang Xuewu's house collapsed, she took the initiative to lend him 1 shi of barley to repair the house. When Xue Chengfu's family lost two people, she cooperated with the village cadres to mobilize the masses for mutual aid. She also helped the 57-year-old lonely and widowed Xia Zixian to plow the fields, carry manure, carry water, and grind wheat.

    肥东县妇女劳动模范萧大娘
    编辑同志：萧大娘是肥东县第一届劳动模范代表会议评出的头等劳动模范。解放前，她因为没有田，受尽了苦难。解放后，她在土地改革中积极地斗争恶霸地主，分田分粮大公无私，工作积极负责，因此被选为乡妇联主任，区、县妇联委员。人们都敬爱她，萧大娘的名字被到处传开了。
    萧大娘是热爱祖国的。去年三月初开区各界人民代表会议时，她认识了抗美援朝运动的意义，认识了美国强盗的野心。她回忆起了日本鬼子的残暴；又看到自己现在儿孙满堂、土地房屋和耕牛一点不缺的幸福生活。因此，会还没有散，她就连夜跑到家里动员她的儿子参加志愿军。她领着孩子，在夏天推麦子，赚了三万元来捐献。她家应缴的七百斤公粮，两次就缴清了。她遇见人就宣传有国才有家的道理。
    土地改革初步结束，她就响应毛主席的号召参加了互助组。在她吃苦在前，以身作则的影响下，她们的互助组日趋巩固。她的三亩七分麦田往年收六石大麦，去年收了八石。
    她时刻关心生活困难的农民兄弟们。方学五的房子倒了，她就主动地借给他一石大麦，修理房子。薛成府家死了两个人，她就配合乡村干部动员群众互济。她还帮助五十七岁的老孤寡夏子贤犁田、挑粪、挑水、磨麦。  一读者
