    Suggestion to Strengthen Leadership Over Collective Dance

    Editor's Note: Mass collective dance activities have been widely launched in Beijing. Recently, we have continuously received letters from comrades Zhao Wenpu, Tan Jinkai, Sun Juhua, Yi Jun, and Lü Guangang, suggesting that relevant units such as the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration pay attention to leading these mass activities. At the same time, they hope that music and dance workers can create collective dance music and dance teaching materials for everyone. We are now publishing excerpts from their letters as follows, and we ask relevant departments, especially the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, to study them and publish the methods for strengthening leadership in the future in the newspaper.

    Zhao Wenpu wrote in his letter: Since the "May Day" Labor Day this year, the mass collective dance in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing has not stopped for a single day. The main participants in the dance are workers, students, cadres, soldiers, shop assistants, etc. Every Saturday night, as many as hundreds of people come here to participate in the dance. However, this activity lacks leadership. I suggest that the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, the Labor People's Cultural Palace, the Youth Service Department and other relevant units find ways to lead this activity.

    Sun Juhua wrote in his letter: The liberated Chinese people, with the improvement of their lives, cultural and entertainment activities have become an indispensable part of their lives. Now, every holiday, the people's square of the capital - Tiananmen - gathers many working people; everyone sings and dances with unparalleled excitement. After a week of hard work, everyone needs this kind of entertainment. I suggest that relevant departments broadcast collective dance music in Tiananmen Square every holiday to attract more people from the capital to come to the square to dance.

    Yi Jun of Peking University said in his letter: In the "Brief Review of Cultural Life" on the third page of the People's Daily on June 2, it was pointed out that the phenomenon of using American jazz music or other pornographic songs to accompany dancing should be corrected. I completely agree with this opinion. However, I feel that there are too few records that can be used for dancing today. Now that collective dance activities have been launched in Beijing, I hope that composers can write some collective dance music as soon as possible, and the relevant authorities will make them into records.

    Lü Guangang wrote in his letter: Collective dance is an art form that is loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and people of all strata. However, at present, there is a lack of talents who can teach collective dance in large numbers, and there are no perfect teaching materials on collective dance. I hope that the dance workers of the Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe, the Youth Art Theater and other professional art groups will compile some collective dance teaching materials in order to promote this culturally entertaining activity with educational significance.

    Tan Jinkai said in his letter: At present, there is a phenomenon of "supply exceeding demand" in the creation of collective dances. The same old sets are danced over and over again. I suggest that dance workers create more good collective dance music and collective dance teaching materials.

    建议加强对于集体舞蹈的领导
    编者按：群众性的集体舞蹈活动，已在北京市广泛地展开了。最近，我们连续收到赵文朴、谈金铠、孙聚华、宜军、吕光昂等同志的来信，他们建议北京市人民政府文化事业管理处等有关单位，注意领导这种群众活动，同时，希望音乐、舞蹈工作者能为大家创作集体舞曲和舞蹈教材。现在把他们的来信摘要发表如下，请有关部门，首先是北京市人民政府文化事业管理处加以研究，把今后加强领导的办法在报上公布。
    赵文朴来信说：自从今年“五一”劳动节以后，北京天安门前群众性的集体舞蹈，没有一天停止过。参加舞蹈的主要是工人、学生、机关干部、战士、店员等。每个星期六晚上，来这里参加舞蹈的人多至几百人。可是，这一活动是缺乏领导的。我建议北京市人民政府文化事业管理处、劳动人民文化宫、青年服务部等有关单位，设法把这一活动领导起来。
    孙聚华来信说：解放了的中国人民，随着生活的改善，文化娱乐活动成了生活中不可缺少的一部分。现在，每逢假日，首都的人民广场——天安门，就聚集了不少劳动人民；大家以无比兴奋的心情歌唱着，舞蹈着。大家在紧张地工作了一个星期之后，是需要这种娱乐活动的。我建议有关部门每逢假日就在天安门广场放送集体舞曲，吸引首都更多的人到广场上来舞蹈。
    北京大学宜军的信中说：六月二日人民日报第三版“文化生活简评”中指出，应当纠正用美国爵士音乐或其他黄色歌曲伴舞的现象，我对这一意见完全同意。但是，我感到今天可以伴舞的唱片太少了。现在集体舞蹈的活动已在北京市开展起来，我希望作曲家们能尽快地写出一些集体舞曲，由有关机关把它制成唱片。
    吕光昂来信说：集体舞是广大工人、农民、战士和各阶层人民喜闻乐见的艺术形式。但是，目前既缺乏大量教授集体舞的人才，又没有完善的关于集体舞蹈的教材。我希望中央戏剧学院舞蹈团、青年艺术剧院等专业文艺团体的舞蹈工作者，编撰一些集体舞的教材，以便推广这种富有教育意义的文化娱乐活动。
    谈金铠的信中说：目前集体舞的创作发生了“供不应求”的现象，跳来跳去还是旧的几套，我建议舞蹈工作者多创作些好的集体舞曲和集体舞教材。
