    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th: The Korean Central News Agency reports: The extremely wicked and immoral U.S. imperialist aggressors have continuously bombed power plants on the Yalu River, Changjin River, Pujon River, and Hochon River, with the Supung Dam power plant as the leader, on the 23rd and 24th of this month during the daytime. The above-mentioned power plants are not military facilities, but purely peaceful facilities that supply the lives and welfare of the Korean people. This is a universally recognized fact. Today, the U.S. imperialist aggressors show no sincerity in the armistice negotiations and deliberately sabotage the armistice negotiations in an attempt to expand the Korean War. They even bomb power plants that the Korean people cannot live without even for a moment in their peaceful lives. This is an unprecedented barbaric crime. All the Korean people are more inspired with volcanic anger and hatred for the enemy by the enemy's monstrous crimes and ignite a strong fighting spirit of never living under the same sky. Good people all over the world have also expressed fiery protests against the barbarity of the U.S. imperialist beasts and expressed unlimited support and solidarity with the Korean people. All the Korean people will never succumb to any barbarous atrocities of the enemy. We will strengthen our confidence in victory and fight bravely to win the final victory.
     Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: TASS, Pyongyang, June 26th: The U.S. Air Force bombed non-military targets in North Korea on June 23rd and 24th. U.S. planes specifically bombed the Yalu River hydroelectric power station.
    The U.S. Air Force also barbarously bombed Changjin and an area on the Yalu River, which had no military targets. A hospital where many wounded soldiers lived was particularly heavily bombed, resulting in the sacrifice of many people.
    Such indiscriminate bombing and destruction by U.S. planes can only arouse universal anger. It is particularly infuriating that U.S. planes are carrying out barbaric bombing while armistice negotiations are still in progress, and peaceful cities and power stations are not spared.

    美机竟滥炸鸭绿江发电厂等非军事设备
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社讯：极恶无道的美帝国主义侵略者们，连续在二十三、二十四两日日间轰炸了以水丰发电厂为首的鸭绿江、长津江、赴战江、虚川江等各发电厂。上述各发电厂并非军事的设备，而纯粹是供给朝鲜人民的生活与福利的和平设备，这是举世公认的事实。今天美帝国主义侵略者们对于停战谈判毫不表示诚意，蓄意破坏停战谈判，企图扩大朝鲜战争。他们甚至轰炸朝鲜人民在和平生活上一时也不能缺少的发电厂，这是旷古未闻的野蛮的罪行。全体朝鲜人民对于敌人的滔天罪行，更激发火山般的愤怒和雠敌心，而燃烧起绝不共戴天的强烈的斗志。全世界善良的人民，对于美帝国主义野兽们的蛮行也表示了怒火般的抗议，对于朝鲜人民表示无限的支持和声援。全体朝鲜人民对于敌人的任何野蛮暴行，决不屈服。我们更加强胜利的信心，为了争取最后胜利而勇敢奋斗。
     【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社平壤二十六日电：美国空军于六月二十三日与二十四日轰炸北朝鲜的非军事目标。美国飞机特地轰炸鸭绿江水力发电站。
    美国空军还野蛮地轰炸什么军事目标也没有的长津城和鸭绿江上一个地区，这里一个住了许多伤员的医院受到特别猛烈的轰炸，因此牺牲了许多的人。
    美国飞机这样滥炸和破坏只会激起普遍的愤怒。特别令人愤怒的是：当着停战谈判还在进行之际，美国飞机竟然实行野蛮轰炸，和平城市和电力站都不能幸免。
