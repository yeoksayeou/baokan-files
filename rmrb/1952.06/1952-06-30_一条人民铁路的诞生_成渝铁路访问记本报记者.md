The Birth of a People's Railway
--A Visit to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway
By Our Reporter Lin Li

On July 1st this year, in the southwest of our great motherland, in Sichuan, a province with dense population and rich resources, two trains, adorned with red and colored decorations, will simultaneously speed along the newly built railway between the mountains and rivers of Bashu (ancient name for the area of Sichuan). One train will depart from Chongqing, running northwest along the undulating mountains, upstream along the Yangtze and Tuo Rivers; the other will depart from Chengdu, passing through the rice paddies of the "Land of Abundance," traversing the lush sugarcane fields and the beautiful citrus fruit producing areas, and heading southeast. When these two trains give the signal to move forward, hundreds of thousands of people in Chengdu and Chongqing will simultaneously hold a "Grand Celebration Ceremony for the Full Opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway." From that day on, the distance between Chengdu and Chongqing will be shortened, and the economic and cultural life of the people in Sichuan and even the entire Southwest will undergo tremendous changes. In the words of the people along the line: This road to happiness has begun to serve the people.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is 505 kilometers long, starting from Chongqing in the east and ending in Chengdu in the west, passing through eight counties and more than fifty towns. Construction of this railway began on June 15, 1950, and was completed in mid-June this year. This railway project, which took only two years, had been clamored for for half a century.

Speaking of the history of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, it is not difficult for people to think of the enormous price paid by the people of the Southwest, especially the people of Sichuan. From 1903 to the liberation of the Southwest, the people of Sichuan paid countless amounts of money, shed a lot of blood, and carried out many heroic and magnificent struggles for this railway. However, for fifty years, not a single rail had been laid on the Chengdu-Chongqing line. As early as around 1906, various imperialist countries seized the privilege of building railways in many regions of our country. The people of Sichuan responded to the ugly crime of the Qing Dynasty's sale of railway construction rights with the determined action of self-constructing the Sichuan-Hankou Railway. At that time, farmers contributed grain and money, public educators contributed salaries, and businessmen raised funds to invest in shares, totaling more than 20 million taels of silver. Under the name of "commercial operation," they formed the "Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company," planning to build a railway on the long mountainous area from Chengdu to Hankou to connect the transportation between the Southwest and the Central Plains. However, after all the preparations were completed, the corrupt Qing Dynasty suddenly announced in 1911 that the Sichuan-Hankou Railway would be "nationalized." The people of Sichuan knew that the so-called "nationalization" was a prelude to confiscating all private stocks and selling the right to build the railway to imperialist countries. The broad masses of people rose up in resistance, quickly forming a massive torrent of protest. Students in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places went on strike, merchants closed their shops, and Chengdu citizens "lined up to petition the governor's office." However, the Qing Dynasty ignored the opposition of the broad masses of the people and ordered the "guards to fire and suppress the protests, killing and wounding dozens of people." However, the flames of resistance did not subside. "The upheaval expanded further. People from the surrounding villages gathered thousands of people to besiege Chengdu, shaking the provincial capital and plunging the entire province into chaos." On the 1,700-mile route from Chengdu to Yichang, there were mass demonstrations everywhere. The Railway Protection Movement further developed into a struggle of the broad masses of peasants to "refuse to pay taxes." It was not until the local authorities agreed to return all the share money that people buried the remains of the martyrs. Although the people did not get the refunded money in this movement, they shattered the Qing Dynasty's despicable conspiracy to sell railway rights. The Martyrs' Monument to commemorate the heroic sacrifices of the people in the Railway Protection Movement still stands in the "People's Park" in Chengdu.

After 1911, the rulers of Sichuan repeatedly used the Sichuan people's eagerness to develop transportation and build railways to plunder the people's wealth. By the time of the bloody rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, in 1936, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, headed by Song Ziwen, sold the right to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to French imperialists for a loan of 56 million silver dollars. What the Qing Dynasty dared not do, the Chiang Kai-shek government openly realized. However, the Kuomintang bandit gang completely did not give up the opportunity to exploit the people under the pretext of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. They asked the people for donations and taxes time and time again. There were no less than dozens of kinds of "railway donations" and "road construction taxes." No one could figure out how much money they had plundered. In 1945, Chiang Kai-shek also issued a "guarantee" to the people of Sichuan, saying that "the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will be open to traffic within two years." However, until the liberation of the Southwest, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on our country's map was still a dotted line.

The people of Sichuan demanded the development of transportation and the construction of railways, which was an inevitable result of the development of production. For a long time, the transportation conditions in the Southwest could not meet the needs of production development. In some places, primitive transportation affected and restricted economic development. Before the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, there were no railway facilities in the Southwest region except for a section of railway on the edge of Yunnan. The Southwest is rich in mineral resources and abundant products. The western section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is the Chengdu Plain, historically known as the "Land of Abundance." In more than thirty counties there, many counties have more paddy fields than dry land. There are endless rice fields and large-leaf tobacco for making "cigars." From Chengdu southeast, passing through Jianyang, Ziyang, Zizhong to Neijiang, is the famous "Sugar Capital" of the country. People affectionately call it "Sweet Neijiang." The sugarcane in this area is like sorghum in North and Northeast China. Until the early winter, it is still a green curtain. The output of sugarcane sugar in the Neijiang area accounts for 70% to 80% of the sugar production in the Southwest region. At its peak, the annual output was more than 2.2 million dan (100 jin per dan). While refining sugarcane sugar, more than 100,000 gallons of alcohol can be produced every month. Light industry in the Neijiang area is very developed, with sugar houses and alcohol factories everywhere. Forty-five kilometers southwest of the railway main line, from Neijiang, is the famous Zigong salt area. More than half of the table salt needed by the people of the Southwest is supplied from here. At its peak, the annual output of well salt was more than 5.2 million dan. Along the railway main line to Longchang, Rongchang, Yongchuan, and Jiangjin, the precious Sichuan citrus fruits are as many as persimmons in the north. Xia Bu, a national favorite, is also produced here. Coal, which is currently most lacking in the Southwest, can produce more than 2 million tons annually here (the reserves are estimated to be at least 440 million tons). Chongqing, the terminal station of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, is currently the center of heavy industry in the Southwest. The steel rails and accessories used for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway are produced here. On this 500-kilometer route, abundant products require modern transportation tools to expand its sales market.

However, in the past, transportation here was very inconvenient and transporting goods was extremely difficult. Freight rates were unimaginably expensive. As soon as a commodity moved, the freight would exceed its value. The price of each ton of coal in the Yongchuan area was 150,000 yuan, and it was sold for 800,000 yuan when transported to Chengdu. The wealthy Chengdu has the conditions to develop various industries, but because coal prices are too high, many factories that should be opened cannot be opened. The broad masses of people have no coal to burn and have to use many useful timber for fuel. Due to inconvenient transportation, freight rates are not only very expensive, but also very slow. Steel rails produced in Chongqing take 40 days to transport to Baimu Town near Neijiang by wooden boat. The Chengdu-Chongqing line produces a variety of special crops, but does not produce or rarely produces grain. The Chengdu Plain is a rice-producing area. Although there is only a distance of more than 100 li between them, special crop areas often cannot buy rice. This seriously affects the mass production of special crops. In 1940, the sugarcane field area in the Neijiang area reached 542,000 mu, producing more than 2.68 billion jin of sugarcane; in 1941, the sugarcane field area dropped sharply to 350,000 mu, and the sugarcane output dropped to more than 1.67 billion jin. The sharp decline in the sugarcane field area and sugarcane output was because the grain supply was in short supply. However, in Chengdu, Xindu, and Dazu, which is not far from Neijiang, one-third or one-quarter of the surplus grain is available every year; in some mountainous areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, there are even bizarre phenomena of feeding pigs with rice or using it as fuel. They can't finish eating rice there, and they can't transport it out, so the price of rice is as low as 200 yuan per jin. However, the industrial products especially needed in the mountains are unbelievably expensive. In Chongqing, a roll of Luyan white cloth only costs 348 jin of rice, but it costs more than 700 jin in the mountainous areas of northern Sichuan. A Shanghai towel is worth dozens of jin of rice when transported to the mountains.

In the Southwest region, the exchange of materials between neighboring counties more than 100 li apart is so difficult, and the transportation with other provinces and regions is even more difficult. North and East China need the Southwest to supply many things, but because of transportation difficulties, many things that should be supplied cannot be transported. In 1950, Shanghai urgently needed grain. At that time, the Southwest prepared 400 million jin of rice, but it could not be transported all because of inconvenient transportation. The Southwest needs Shanghai's industrial products, but Shanghai's goods cannot be directly transported, and must be detoured through Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Baoji to Chengdu. The transportation difficulties in the Southwest hinder the rise of the economic life of the people in the Southwest, affect the development of industry in the Southwest, and also block the normal progress of national material exchanges. The people of the Southwest have long demanded the construction of railways and the development of transportation, but the rulers of the past only knew how to exploit the people's blood and sweat, and no one was willing to answer the people's demands.

After the liberation of the Southwest, the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party immediately tried to meet the demands of the people of the Southwest. However, when the leading organs of the Southwest region announced the plan to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, many people expressed doubts. They said that the Southwest had only been liberated for half a year, the local order was still very chaotic, land reform had not yet begun, and the national financial economy was quite difficult, so where would the strength to build the railway come from? Some people also said that in the history of railway construction in China, every nail, every piece of wood, and every rail had always relied on European and American supplies; now the relationship with Britain and the United States is not smooth, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway does not rely on the sea in the east and has no railway connection in the west, so where will the railway materials for more than 500 kilometers come from! The leading organs of the Southwest region were fully aware that there were many objective difficulties at the time, but they were even more clear about the significant impact of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the economic life of the people in the Southwest and its great significance in national defense construction. Therefore, it was decided to overcome all difficulties and immediately build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. And it was announced that a brand-new people's railway would be built with the hands of the Chinese people and with China's own materials. The Southwest leading organs believed that relying on the leadership of the Central Government and the efforts of the broad masses of the people in the Southwest, they had the ability and the means to build such a railway.

Building a railway is not as easy as building a house. At that time, there was a lack of road construction experience, a lack of technical personnel, a lack of building materials, and even labor became a problem. However, the leading organs of the Southwest region had rich experience in leading wars and mobilizing the masses, and had the courage and determination to overcome all difficulties. They grasped the central link of relying closely on the people. Therefore, in the process of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, they not only completed the task on time, but also created new experiences that had never been seen in the history of railway construction in China. For example, in terms of labor source and labor organization, they changed the old method of contractors recruiting workers, and transferred 28,000 battle-tested soldiers with a high degree of political awareness from the People's Liberation Army as the "pioneers" and main force in building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Another creation to solve the labor shortage was to mobilize 84,000 simple farmers and unemployed workers along the Chengdu-Chongqing line, led by local governments and party committee leaders in person, to participate in road construction, using the method of mobilizing farmers to participate in war service in the old liberated areas. In order to unify and strengthen the leadership of the military, workers, and civilians, the Southwest Military and Political Committee and the Southwest Military Region jointly established the Southwest Railway Engineering Committee. Governments at all levels and local party committees also organized road construction headquarters. At that time, although the peasants had not been tempered by land reform, their class consciousness quickly improved under the education of the road construction headquarters at all levels and the influence of the People's Liberation Army. They understood that building roads was for their own better life and for the economic construction of the motherland. Therefore, their work efficiency quickly exceeded the expected plan. Many farmers initially wanted to "complete the task and go home." After the actual education during the road construction period, they asked to stay in the railway bureau and were willing to serve the railway construction of New China. The Tiancheng Railway South Section project was able to start quickly because this group of skilled workers (they were no longer farmers) served as the main force in road construction.

The process of building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was a process of overcoming difficulties and creating experience, and also a process of reviewing the material strength of the Southwest. At the beginning of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the biggest difficulty was the lack of sleepers. Although there are many large forests in the Southwest, some people said: "Chinese trees cannot be used as sleepers." In order to solve this difficulty, the Southwest Finance and Economic Committee convened a special meeting of three administrative offices and several counties. After discussion and research, it was found that in these three administrative office areas, there were a large number of high-quality Phoebe zhennan and sandalwood, which are ideal materials for manufacturing sleepers. After the meeting, dozens of counties launched a campaign to sell wood materials. Due to the supervision and leadership of governments and party committees at all levels, the sleepers needed at each stage were always delivered in advance, and more than 95% met the specifications. The steel rails and accessories needed for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were manufactured by a state-owned steel plant. Dowels, turnouts, and some machines were undertaken by more than 400 private steel plants in Chongqing. The tools needed by the 100,000 labor army were contracted by the workers of the Chongqing iron industry. The explosives used on the railway in the past, which were bought from the United States, can now be manufactured by factories in the Southwest. It is the first time in the history of railway construction in our country to build a railway entirely with domestic equipment. The initial attempt was successful, indicating that our country has abundant equipment and conditions for building railways.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway not only created new experience in labor organization and pioneered a new era in the history of railway materials supply in our country, but also fully met the new standards of the People's Railway in terms of technical standards and engineering specifications. The original Chengdu-Chongqing Railway designed by the Kuomintang bandit gang was a narrow-gauge small road, and the engineering plan was mostly unreasonable. The current Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is completely redesigned and modified the original route in accordance with the standards and requirements stipulated by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, widened the roadbed, and improved the curvature and slope. The original 530-kilometer route was shortened to 505 kilometers. In the construction process, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was adopted in building roadbeds, erecting bridges, drilling tunnels, and arranging dowels and sleepers, and accurate standards for new-type railways were achieved. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has become the fastest railway with the most stable roadbed and the most solid project in our country.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is a railway built by the people themselves. From the day it started construction, it has brought unlimited happiness and joy to the people of the Southwest and established extremely close ties with the people of the Southwest. Everyone knows that the Southwest was once the last stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and was the region that was liberated latest on the mainland of our country. Before liberation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang sucked the blood of the peasants in the Southwest, causing the vast rural areas to fall into extreme poverty. It destroyed the industry and commerce of the cities, and many factories were shut down and closed down. Take Chongqing, a center of heavy industry, as an example! At that time, the factories of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie were shut down, and the workers were laid off. Private factories could not stop the flood of American goods, and some were shut down and some were closed down. At the beginning of liberation, none of the private steel and machine factories in Chongqing could start production. Many factories were maintained by the relief from the People's Government and loans from the National Bank. At that time, there were 100,000 unemployed workers scattered on the streets of Chongqing. Although the People's Government used great strength, it could not completely change the serious situation of factories having no work to do and workers having no food to eat. After the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway started, state-owned steel plants accepted the task of steel rails for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and private steel and machine plants received more than 500 tons of processing orders. The machines that had been idle for a long time began to turn, and all the workers were back to work. The recovery of the steel and machinery industry drove all industries in Chongqing. According to the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, since the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway started, more than 400 private steel and machine plants in Chongqing have been revived, thousands of ironworkers have work to do, and industries related to road construction, such as cement, carpentry, construction, brick and tile, transportation, chemical industry, and electrical machinery, have also recovered, developed, and grown. The rapid development of industry and commerce in large cities and the gradual opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway have made the small and medium-sized towns along the Chengdu-Chongqing line prosper. Yongchuan was originally a small county town, but now it has become a large grain distribution center. Long mule teams concentrated grain from the surrounding villages to Yongchuan, and then transferred it to Chongqing and other large cities via the Chengdu-Chongqing Road. Near Yongchuan Station, citizens are vying to buy land and building houses in a big way, preparing to welcome greater prosperity. The highway from Yongchuan to Luxian is being planned, and the number of avenues leading to nearby towns has increased by several.

The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway directly brings happiness to the farmers along the line. When 84,000 migrant workers were mobilized to participate in the road construction work, and when farmers were mobilized to sell wood materials, the rural areas of Sichuan were active. The result of purchasing sleepers enabled many farmers in dozens of mountainous counties in Sichuan to tide over the spring famine of that year and restore the ability to reproduce. Many of the migrant workers who participated in road construction were poor peasants who had never slept in mosquito nets or covered with new quilts. During the road construction process, they changed into new clothes on time and got mosquito nets. In addition to enough food, they each had a monthly salary of 100 to 200 jin of rice to send home. These realistic benefits made the people along the line love their railways even more and made the road construction migrant workers more loyal to serve the railway. While still building the roadbed, the migrant workers put forward a resounding slogan: "Guarantee that the train will not have an accident on the roadbed I made." Farmers along the line spontaneously organized road protection teams, and many women guarded and patrolled the lines late at night.

The happiness that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway brings to the people of the Southwest cannot be calculated with numbers. The freight rate for transporting rice from Yongchuan to Chongqing by train is only one-quarter of the previous rate. The freight rate for transporting Yongchuan coal to Chengdu by train has dropped from 800,000 yuan to about 250,000 yuan per ton. The freight rate for Neijiang sugar to Chongqing has also been reduced by two-thirds. The price difference of industrial products in Yongchuan and Chongqing areas has been reduced by two-thirds. Industrialists and businessmen in Chengdu believe that after the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, more than 1,200 kinds of special products in the Southwest that could not be transported out in the past can be transported to East China, North China, and the Central Plains in large quantities. They said that the freight rate for transporting jute from Chengdu to Chongqing by train is only 6.1% of the car cost and 18.6% of the wooden boat freight rate. And the speed of train transportation is several times faster than that of cars and wooden boats. Special products can be sold in large quantities, the prices of industrial products gradually decrease, and the grain needed in special crop areas can be supplied in time, which opens the door for the people along the line to develop production. The sugarcane output in the Neijiang area increased by 36% last year compared with the previous year, and it is estimated that 200,000 tons of cane sugar can be produced this year. The Xia Bu production in Longchang increased by more than 120% last year compared with the previous year. The Chengdu area produced 8,100 dan of flue-cured tobacco last year, and this year it increased to 32,000 dan. The people along the line are infinitely grateful for the happy life brought by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. They said that this is because of the good leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, they chose the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party to hold the full line opening ceremony.

This is the situation when the farmers of Wufengxi gathered to visit when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was paved to Wufengxi on May 16 this year. (Picture attached)

    一条人民铁路的诞生
    ——成渝铁路访问记
    本报记者  林里
    今年七月一日，在我们伟大祖国的西南，在人烟稠密、物产丰富的四川，将有两列披红挂彩的火车，同时飞驰在巴山蜀水之间的新生的铁路上。这两列火车，一列从重庆出发，沿着峰峦起伏的山脉，溯着长江和沱江，一直向西北跑去；另一列从成都出发，穿过“天府之国”的稻田，横越丛绿的甘蔗林和美丽的橘柑产地，一直向东南驰骋。当这两列火车发出前进信号的时候，成都和重庆两地，几十万人将要同时举行“庆祝成渝铁路全线通车典礼大会”。从这一天起，成都到重庆的距离缩短了，四川乃至西南人民的经济生活和文化生活，将要发生巨大的变化。照沿线人民的话说：这一条通往幸福的路，开始为人民服务了。
    成渝铁路共长五百零五公里，东起重庆，西到成都，中间经过八个县，五十多个镇。这条铁路从一九五零年六月十五日开工，在今年六月中旬完工。这条仅仅费时两年的铁路工程，却经过了整整半个世纪的喧嚷。
    说起成渝铁路的历史，人们不难想到西南人民、特别是四川人民所付出的巨大的代价。从一九零三年到西南解放，四川人民为了这条铁路，出过无数的钱，流过不少的血，进行过许多英勇、壮烈的斗争。然而五十年来，成渝路上始终没有铺过一条钢轨。远在一九零六年前后，各帝国主义国家在我国许多地区，夺得了修筑铁路的特权。四川人民以自修川汉铁路的刚毅行动，回答了满清王朝出卖筑路权的丑恶罪行。那时候，农民们拿出粮款，公教人员拿出薪金，商人们集资入股，共计拼凑了二千多万两白银，用“商办”名义，组成了“川汉铁路公司”，计划在成都到汉口的漫长山地上，修筑一条铁路，以沟通西南和中原的交通。但在一切准备就绪之后，腐朽的满清王朝，突于一九一一年宣布川汉铁路收归“国有”。四川人民知道：所谓收归“国有”就是要把私人的股票全部没收，把筑路权出卖给帝国主义国家的前奏。广大人民群起反抗，很快地形成了声势浩大的抗议洪流。重庆、成都等地的学生罢课，商人罢市，成都市民并“列队向督署请愿”。但满清王朝不顾广大人民群众的反对，竟令“警卫鸣枪弹压，毙伤数十人”。然而反抗的烈火并未平熄。“风潮更形扩大。四乡人民纠集数千人围攻成都，省垣为之大震，全省陷入混乱”。在成都到宜昌一千七百多里的路线上，到处都有群众游行示威。保路运动进而发展成为广大农民群众的“拒纳租税”的斗争。直到地方当局答应退还全部股款，人们才掩埋了烈士的遗体。这次运动，人民虽然没有得到退还的股金，但却粉碎了满清王朝出卖路权的卑鄙阴谋。为纪念在保路运动中英勇牺牲的人民的烈士碑，至今还矗立在成都市的“人民公园”里。
    一九一一年后，四川的统治者几次利用四川人民渴望发展交通、兴修铁路的迫切心情，搜刮人民的财富。到了国民党匪帮血腥统治时代，一九三六年，以宋子文为首的川黔铁路公司，以五千六百万银元的贷款，把成渝铁路的筑路权出卖给法帝国主义。满清王朝所不敢做的事，蒋介石政府公开实现了。但是，国民党匪帮完全没有放弃藉口修筑成渝路向人民搜刮榨取的机会。他们一次又一次地向人民要捐要税。什么“铁路捐”、“修路税”，名目之多，不下几十种。究竟搜刮了多少钱，也没有人能算清楚。一九四五年，蒋介石还向四川人民发出
    “保票”，说“两年内保证成渝铁路通车”。然而直到西南解放，我国地图上的成渝铁路，还是一条虚线。
    四川人民要求发展交通，兴修铁路，这是生产发展的必然结果。长久以来，西南的交通条件不能满足生产发展的需要。在若干地方，原始的交通影响和限制了经济的发展。成渝铁路通车以前，西南地区除云南边缘上有一段铁路外，再没有铁路设备。西南矿藏丰富，物产丰饶，成渝铁路的西段是    史称“天府之国”的成都平原。那里的三十多个县中，许多县的水田超过了旱地。那里到处是望不到尽头的稻田和制作“雪茄”的大叶烟。从成都东南行，经过简阳、资阳、资中到内江，是全国著名的“糖都”。人们亲昵地把她称为“甜内江”。这个区域的甘蔗，就像华北和东北的高粱。直到初冬，还是一片碧绿的青纱帐。内江区的蔗糖产量占西南区糖产量的百分之七十到八十，最盛时期，年产量曾达二百二十多万担（每担一百斤）。在提炼蔗糖的同时，每月还可生产十万加仑以上的酒精。内江地区的轻工业十分发达，到处是糖房和酒精厂。离开铁路干线，从内江往西南走四十五公里，是全国著名的自流井盐区。西南人民所需要的食盐，半数以上由这里供给。最盛时期曾经年产井盐五百二十多万担。沿铁路干线到隆昌、荣昌、永川和江津，名贵的四川橘柑，就像北方的柿子那样多。为全国人民所喜爱的夏布，也出产在这里。目前西南最感缺乏的煤炭，这里年产可达二百多万吨（蕴藏量估计最少有四亿四千多万吨）。成渝铁路的终点站重庆，是目前西南重工业的中心。成渝铁路所用的钢轨和配件，就是在这里生产的。在这五百多公里的路线上，丰富的物产，要求有近代化的运输工具，扩展它的销售市场。
    然而，在过去，这里的交通非常不便，运输货物异常困难。运价贵到不可想像的程度。一件商品，稍一移动，运费就要超过它本身的价值。永川地区每吨煤价十五万元，运到成都就卖八十万元。富饶的成都具有发展各种工业的条件，但因煤价过高，许多应该开办的工厂，都不能开办。广大群众没有煤烧，不得不用许多有用的木材做燃料。由于交通不便，运价不但很贵，时间而且很慢。重庆生产的钢轨，用木船运到内江附近的椑木镇，就要费时四十天。成渝沿线地区，多种特种作物，并不出产或者很少出产粮食。而成都平原却是产米区。中间相隔不过百多里，但时常发生特种作物区买不到米的现象。这就严重地影响了特种作物的大量生产。一九四零年内江地区的蔗田面积曾达五十四万二千亩，生产甘蔗二十六亿八千多万斤；到了一九四一年，蔗田面积骤降至三十五万亩，甘蔗产量降为一十六亿七千多万斤。蔗田面积和甘蔗产量骤然下降，就是因为粮食供不应求。但在成都、新都和离内江不远的大足等地，每年却有三分之一或四分之一的余粮；四川、云南和贵州等省的若干山地，还有拿大米喂猪、或者当作燃料的离奇现象。那里的大米吃不完，又运不出去，米价贱到每斤二百元。可是山地特别需要的工业品，又贵到令人难以相信的程度。在重庆，一匹芦雁白布只要三百四十八斤大米，到川北山区却要七百斤以上。一条上海毛巾，运到山地就值好几十斤大米。
    在西南区，距离百多里的邻近县份，物资交流就这样困难，和外省、外区的交通，就越发不容易了。华北、华东都需要西南供给许多东西，因为运输困难，许多应该供应的东西都运不出去。一九五零年，上海急需粮食，当时西南准备了四亿斤大米，只是因为运输不便，不能全部运去。西南需要上海的工业品，但上海的商品不能直接运来，必须绕道徐州、郑州、西安、宝鸡转成都。西南的交通困难，障碍了西南人民经济生活的上升，影响了西南工业的发展，也阻塞了全国物资交流的正常进行。西南人民早就要求兴修铁路，发展交通，但历来的统治阶级，只知搜刮人民的血汗，谁都不肯答复人民的要求。
    西南解放以后，在共产党领导下的人民政府，立即设法满足西南人民的要求。但是，当着西南区领导机关宣布了修筑成渝铁路的计划时，许多人曾经是表示怀疑的。他们说，西南刚刚解放半年，地方秩序还很混乱，土地改革没有开始，国家财政经济相当困难，那有力量修铁路呢？也有人说，在中国铁道建设史上，一钉、一木、一轨，从来都靠欧美供给；现在和英美关系不通，成渝铁路东不靠海，西没有铁路相联，五百多公里的铁路器材，从那里来呀！西南区领导机关完全知道当时的客观困难很多，但却更清楚成渝铁路对西南人民经济生活的重大影响和它在国防建设上的巨大意义。因此，还是决定克服一切困难，立即修筑成渝铁路。并且宣布：要用中国人民的手，中国自己的器材，建设一条崭新的人民铁路。西南领导机关相信：依靠中央的领导，依靠西南广大人民的努力，是有能力、有办法修成这样一条铁路的。
    建设一条铁路，决不像修盖一幢房屋那样容易。当时，缺乏筑路经验，缺乏技术人员，缺乏建筑材料，甚至劳动力也成问题。但是，西南区领导机关，有丰富的领导战争、发动群众的经验，有克服
    一切困难的勇气和决心，他们掌握了紧紧依靠人民的中心环节。因此，在修筑成渝铁路的过程中，不仅按时完成了任务，而且创造了中国铁道建设史上从来没有过的新经验。比如，在劳力来源和劳力组织上，他们改变了包商招工的旧办法，而从人民解放军中，抽调了二万八千名身经百战、有高度政治觉悟的战士，作为修筑成渝铁路的“开路先锋”和主力。解决劳力困难的又一创造，是用过去老解放区发动农民参加战争勤务的办法，在成渝沿线动员了八万四千名淳朴的农民和失业工人，由各地地方政府和党委负责人，亲自带领，参加修路。为了统一和加强对军工、民工的领导，西南军政委员会和西南军区共同成立了西南铁路工程委员会。各级政府和地方党委，亦组织了筑路指挥部。当时，农民虽然没有经过土地改革的锻炼，但在各级筑路指挥部的教育和人民解放军的影响下，阶级觉悟很快地提高了。他们懂得了修路是为了自己的美好的生活，是为了祖国的经济建设，因此，他们的工作效率很快地超过了预期的计划。很多农民最初是想“完成任务回家”的。经过筑路期间的实际教育，他们要求留在路局工作，愿为新中国的铁路建设服务。天成铁路南段工程能够迅速开工，就是因为这批熟练工人（他们已不再是农民了）充当了筑路的主力。
    修筑成渝铁路的过程，是克服困难，创造经验的过程，也是检阅西南的物资实力的过程。在成渝铁路动工之初，最大的困难是没有枕木。西南虽然有很多大森林，但有些人说：“中国树不能做枕木。”为了解决这个困难，西南财政经济委员会召开了三个行署和若干县的专门会议，经过讨论研究，发现在这三个行署区，有大批品质优良的楠木和香檀，是制造枕木的理想材料。会后，几十个县发动了献卖木料的运动。由于各级政府和党委的督促领导，各个阶段所需要的枕木总是提前送到，而且百分之九十五以上合乎规格。成渝铁路所需要的钢轨和配件，国营某钢铁厂制造出来了。道钉、道岔和某些机器，重庆四百多家私营钢铁厂承担起来了。十万劳动大军所需要的工具，重庆铁作业的职工包做了。过去铁路上用的从美国买来的火药，西南的工厂自己能够制造了。完全用本国的器材修铁路，在我国铁路建设史上，这还是第一次。初次尝试就获得成功，说明了我国有建设铁路的丰富器材和条件。
    成渝铁路不仅在劳力组织上创造了新经验，在材料供应上开辟了我国铁道史上的新纪元，而且在技术标准和工程规格上，也完全达到了人民铁道的新标准。原来国民党匪帮设计的成渝铁路，是一条窄轨小路，工程计划多不合理。现在的成渝铁路，完全按照中央人民政府铁道部所规定的标准和要求，重新设计和修改了原有的路线，放宽了路基，改善了弯度和坡度。原来五百三十公里长的路线，缩短为五百零五公里。在施工过程中，修筑路基，架设桥梁，钻穿隧道以及道钉和枕木的安排，都采用了苏联的先进经验，达到了新型铁道的准确标准。成渝铁路已成为我国修筑最快，路基最稳，工程最牢的铁路。
    成渝铁路是人民自己修筑的铁路。它从开工的那天起，就给西南人民带来了无限的幸福和喜悦，和西南人民建立了极其密切的联系。大家知道：西南曾经是蒋介石匪帮的最后堡垒，是我国大陆上解放最晚的区域。解放前，蒋介石匪帮吸干了西南农民的血，使广大农村陷入极度贫困。它摧毁了城市的工商业，许多工厂停工、倒闭了。就以重工业集中地的重庆来说吧！当时，官僚资本的工厂停工了，工人被遣散了。私人工厂挡不住美货泛滥的洪流，停工的停工，倒闭的倒闭。解放初期，重庆私营钢铁机器厂没有一家能够开工生产。许多工厂是靠人民政府的救济和国家银行的贷款维持下来的。当时，流散在重庆街头的失业工人有十万人。人民政府虽然用了极大的力量，还不能完全改变工厂没工做，工人没饭吃的严重情况。成渝铁路开工后，国营钢铁厂接受了成渝铁路的钢轨任务，私营钢铁机器厂得到了五百多吨加工定货。停顿许久的机器开始转动了，工人全部复工了。钢铁机器业的复苏，带动了重庆所有的行业。据重庆工商联合会报告：自从成渝铁路开工以来，重庆四百多家私营钢铁机器厂复活了，上千户的铁作业有工可做了，和筑路有关的水泥、木作、建筑、砖瓦、运输、化工、电工机材等等行业，也都恢复、发展、壮大了。大城市工商业迅速发展，成渝铁路逐段通车，使成渝沿线的中小城镇繁荣起来了。永川原是一座小县城，现在成了很大的粮食集散地。漫长的驮骡队把粮食由四乡集中到永川，再由成渝路转到重庆等大城市去。在永川车站附近，市民争购地基，大兴土木，准备迎接更大的繁荣。永川通往泸县的公路正在筹划，通往附近城镇的大道增多了好几条。
    成渝铁路直接给沿线农民带来幸福。当动员八万四千名民工参加筑路工作的时候，当发动农民献卖木料的时候，四川的农村活动起来了。购买枕木的结果，使四川山区几十个县的许多农民度过了当年的春荒，恢复了再生产的能力。参加筑路的民工，许多是从来没有睡过蚊帐，没有盖过新被的贫农。在修路过程中，他们按时换上了新衣，得到了蚊帐。除了足够的吃食，他们每人每月都有一、二百斤大米的工资寄回家去。这些现实的福利，使沿线人民更加热爱自己的铁路，使筑路民工更加忠诚地为铁路服务。还在打路基的时候，民工就提出响亮的口号：“保证火车不在我做的路基上出事故。”沿线农民自动组织了护路队，许多妇女深更半夜还在线路上护守巡逻。
    成渝铁路带给西南人民的幸福是不可能用数字计算的。永川的大米用火车运到重庆，运价只合从前的四分之一。永川煤用火车运到成都，每吨煤价由过去的八十万元降到二十五万元左右。内江糖到重庆，运价也减少了三分之二。永川和重庆地区的工业品差价减低了三分之二。成都的工商业者，认为成渝铁路通车后，有一千二百多种过去不能外运的西南特产，可以大量运往华东、华北和中原。他们说：用火车从成都运大麻到重庆，运价只等于汽车费用的百分之六点一，等于木船运价的百分之十八点六。而且火车运输的速度，比汽车、木船都快好几倍。特产品能够大量外销，工业品价格逐步下降，特种作物区所需要的粮食能够及时得到供应，这就给沿线人民打开了发展生产的大门。内江区的甘蔗产量，去年比前年增加百分之三十六，预计今年可以产蔗糖二十万吨。隆昌的夏布，去年比前年增产百分之一百二十多。成都地区去年生产烤烟八千一百担，今年增至三万二千担。沿线人民对于成渝铁路带来的幸福生活，怀着无限的感激。他们说，这是中国共产党、毛主席领导的好，因此，他们选定中国共产党建党三十一周年纪念日，举行全线通车典礼。
