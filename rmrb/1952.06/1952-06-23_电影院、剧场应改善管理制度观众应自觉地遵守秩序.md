Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editor's Note: Recently, this newspaper received letters from readers raising concerns about the management and order of cinemas and theaters in Beijing. We forwarded these opinions to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration, which provided a comprehensive response based on these and other reader opinions received. We are now publishing a summary of the Cultural Affairs Administration's response to this issue below.

    Recently, we have received many letters from readers raising shortcomings and constructive suggestions regarding the management of theaters and cinemas. Most of these opinions are correct. These letters show that the general audience not only pays attention to the criticism and encouragement of film and theater content, but also is very concerned about the order, management system, environmental sanitation, and other aspects of cinemas and theaters. We have discussed these opinions in detail with the relevant units and are now giving a comprehensive response to general issues as follows:

    Regarding the order of cinemas and theaters: Generally speaking, the management systems of Beijing's public cinemas and theaters are becoming more rationalized. However, some unreasonable phenomena still exist in a large number of theaters. For example, reader Wu Chuntang and others pointed out that Qingle Theater still has a tea selling system and the phenomenon of hawking snacks inside the venue; during the program, the staff's hawking is very noisy, and some walk around the venue asking the audience for money to express their gratitude. In addition, some audience members clap, cheer, and heckle, making the theater order quite chaotic, which seriously affects the audience's viewing experience. Some theaters have too few staff responsible for assigned seating, or do not assign seats at all. For example, the concert hall has numbered tickets but does not assign seats. Reader Huang Weichuo said: "Generally, the staff get off work late, and if there is no assigned seating, even if you buy the ticket first, you won't be able to get a good seat." Cui Guizhen also pointed out that the order at the entrance of the concert hall is too chaotic and someone should maintain order; or it should be opened earlier so that the audience can enter as they arrive to avoid crowding. Relevant cinemas and theaters have indicated that they are willing to accept these opinions and improve order and strengthen management in the future. The tea selling system in private theaters is related to the livelihood of the staff, and we plan to further study and gradually reform it with relevant units.

    Some audience members have not yet established a correct attitude towards art appreciation, focusing solely on the unhealthy stage image of individual actors during the performance, and clapping and cheering loudly during the program, which affects other people's viewing experience; some people are not consciously abiding by theater rules, do not value the collective interests of public places, smoke inside the venue, and talk loudly. Consciously abiding by theater order is also one of the excellent moral qualities of the people of New China. We hope that theater and cinema audiences will gradually establish this new moral view and correct the above-mentioned bad phenomena.

### 电影院、剧场应改善管理制度观众应自觉地遵守秩序

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    电影院、剧场应改善管理制度观众应自觉地遵守秩序
    编者按：最近本报曾接到一些读者来信，对北京的电影院、剧场的管理和秩序问题提出意见。我们把这些意见转给北京市人民政府文化事业管理处，该处连同收到的其他读者的意见，作了综合答覆。现在把文化事业管理处关于这一问题的答覆摘要发表于后。
    最近，我们收到很多读者来信，提出了对剧场、电影院管理方面的一些缺点和不少建设性的意见。这些意见大部分是正确的。从这些来信中可以看出广大观众不但注意到对影剧内容的批评与鼓励，而且对于电影院、剧场的秩序、管理制度、环境卫生等各方面，也都非常关心。对这些意见，我们都已经和有关单位详细研究磋商，现在只就一般性的问题，综合答覆如下：
    影剧院秩序问题：北京市公营影剧院，一般地说来，管理制度是日趋合理化了。但是仍有一大部分剧场，存在着某些不合理的现象。例如读者吴春棠等提出的庆乐戏院还有卖茶制度及在场内叫卖零食的现象；在节目进行中，职工叫卖声音很乱，有的在场内来往走动，向观众要钱道谢。再加上某些观众鼓掌、喊好起哄，使剧场秩序变得相当紊乱，严重地影响了观众看戏。有的剧场，负责作对号入座的工作人员太少，或是根本不对号。如音乐堂票上有号而不对号入座。读者黄维绰说：“一般工作人员，下班较晚，如果不对号，先买的票也坐不上好座。”崔桂珍也提出音乐堂门口秩序太乱，应该有人维持秩序；或是提早开放，观众可以随来随入，以免拥挤。有关影剧院知道这些意见后，都愿接受，愿在今后改进秩序，加强管理。私营剧场的卖茶制度，因为关系到职工生活问题，我们准备进一步与有关单位研究，逐步加以改革。
    有些观众还没有建立正确的艺术欣赏态度，在观剧时单纯注意个别演员不够健康的舞台形象，在节目进行中大声鼓掌、叫好，影响别人看戏；还有些人不自觉地遵守剧场制度，不重视公共场所的集体利益，在场内吸烟，大声谈笑。自觉地遵守剧场秩序，这也是新中国人民优良品德之一，希望影剧观众们逐渐树立这种新的道德观，纠正上述不良现象。
