Xinhua News Agency, May 31st, Rome Dispatch: Provincial council elections in twenty-four provinces and municipal council elections in more than one thousand four hundred towns in central, southern, and northern Italy were held on the 25th and 26th. The election results reflect the current political situation in Italy: the people's democratic forces led by the Italian Communist Party are continuing to grow stronger, while the position of the Catholic Democratic Party, which faithfully implements American war policies, has been greatly weakened.

Except for the Aosta region, South Tyrol, and Sicily, where the election results have not yet been fully announced, the People's Group led by the Italian Communist Party won a total of 2,462,000 votes in all the areas where elections were held, which is 400,700 votes more than in the general election on April 18, 1948. The ratio of votes won by the People's Group to the total number of votes increased from 27 percent in 1948 to 33 percent. However, the votes won by the Catholic Democratic Party fell from 48 percent in 1948 to the current 29 percent, a loss of 1,460,000 votes.

In important cities such as Rome, Naples, and Bari, the number of votes for the People's Group has greatly increased, while the number of votes for the Catholic Democratic Party has greatly decreased. The election results are so obvious that even Agence France-Presse said:

"The People's Front has not been defeated anywhere... the Catholic Democratic Party is the real victim of the election."

This local election, which caused a disastrous defeat for the Catholic Democratic Party, was originally scheduled to be held last autumn as part of last year's national local elections. The Catholic Democratic government of Gasperi delayed it until now, which contained ulterior motives. Originally, in the provincial and municipal council elections in fifty-seven provinces and the Sicilian regional council elections in May and June last year, the votes of the People's Group led by the Italian Communist Party reached 40 percent of the total votes, while the Catholic Democratic Party lost 2.5 million votes compared to 1948. Gasperi, fearing that his Catholic Democratic Party would suffer an even more disastrous defeat, abused his power, postponed the election, and further relied on the United States to intensify the suppression of the people, in an attempt to consolidate his rule. However, the development of the Italian political situation over the past year has become increasingly unfavorable to him: on the one hand, the people's forces demanding peace and democracy and opposing war and betrayal have grown rapidly, and even many people who originally supported the policies of adhering to the North Atlantic Group, such as former Prime Ministers Nitti and Orlando, have turned to support the Italian Communist Party's proposal to form a peace government and hold general elections immediately; on the other hand, the division within the Italian ruling group, especially the Catholic Democratic Party, has deepened, and the resignation and reorganization of the Gasperi government in July last year was the result of this division reaching an irreparable degree.

In this situation, when the Catholic Democratic Party had to hold this election after repeated delays, it could only try to use the electoral law, which even Senate Speaker Nicola condemned as "the most undemocratic of all electoral systems," to seize seats in the provincial and municipal councils. For example, it seized 39 of the 80 seats in the Rome Municipal Council. The People's Group, which received more than 28,900 more votes than it, received 23 fewer seats. It also used the same method to retain the majority of seats in the municipal councils of the provincial capitals of Calabria and Sardinia, Matera and Potenza, and many cities in Sicily. In addition, it also used the Catholic Church to campaign frantically for it. The Vatican Pope personally came out to interfere, declaring that if Catholics supported the Communist Party, it would be a "crime" and "abstaining would be apostasy," but all these conspiracies and tricks could not prevent the Italian people from achieving new victories. The People's Group not only consolidated its original majority position in the municipal councils of five provincial capitals such as Ferrara and Terni, won the majority of seats in the provincial councils of Rome Province and Spezia Province, and many seats in the provincial councils of provinces such as Pescara, but also won the majority of seats in more than 600 cities and towns in various regions, of which the majority of seats in the municipal councils of 190 cities were taken from the Catholic Democratic Party.

Xinhua News Agency, May 31st Dispatch: According to a TASS report from Rome on the 29th, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti commented on the results of the recent provincial and municipal council elections in Italy in response to questions from the "National Evening News" reporter.

In explaining the political significance of the election results, Togliatti pointed out that the people's democratic forces led by the Communist Party have achieved a huge and undeniable success. It not only repelled the various offensives of the ruling party, the fascists, and the various "Civil Committees" (propaganda organizations of the Catholic Democrats and church authorities), but also made great strides forward everywhere. For example, in Naples, the number of votes won by the Communist Party alone exceeded all the votes won by the People's Democratic Front in the April 1948 election. In many places, the number of votes won by the left wing has more than doubled. The position of the people's democratic forces in northern Italy is as solid as before, and is gradually strengthening. In southern Italy, the working masses are turning to the left-wing democratic and socialist forces; this is truly the beginning of the Italian revival.

Togliatti pointed out that the rise of fascists in Rome and southern Italy in this election is a serious factor. This confronts all Italian democrats and republicans with many major tasks. He said: From Italy's economic situation and international position, as well as its historical traditions, Italy's revival and democratic development has no other way but the road it has taken in the struggle against fascism, against foreign interference, and for the establishment of a democratic and republican system. Abandoning this road will inevitably lead to a serious domestic crisis in Italy and subordinate Italy to foreign countries, thereby endangering Italy's peace. In this election, in many large agricultural centers, the Catholic Democratic Party (the ruling party) was an ally of the fascists and royalists, and this church party used the arguments of the fascist groups to oppose the democratic forces. This situation shows that the entire ruling class is currently moving towards fascism. The Italian people certainly cannot allow this, and in fact, this election also shows that the power of the people will prevail, because whether in the south, on the islands, or in the north, the power of the people is being organized more and more widely and powerfully.

Togliatti then pointed out that the results of this year's and last year's elections have formed a new contrast of domestic political forces. The government should recognize its responsibility to hold general elections as soon as possible. Today's government does not meet the true demands of public opinion. Togliatti finally said: We must immediately start working to consolidate the achievements that have been made, which makes us more confident in the Italian people and more confident that they can move forward and can more firmly recognize their right to be the only true masters of the country.

### 意人民阵线在省市选举中获胜  托里亚蒂主张举行大选建立民主共和制度

    意人民阵线在省市选举中获胜
    托里亚蒂主张举行大选建立民主共和制度
    【新华社三十一日讯】罗马消息：意大利中部、南部和北部若干地区二十四个省的省政委员会选举和一千四百多个市镇的市政委员会选举，已经在二十五日和二十六日举行。选举结果反映了目前意大利的政治情势：意大利共产党所领导的人民民主力量在继续壮大；而忠实执行美国战争政策的天主教民主党的地位大为削弱。
    除奥斯塔地区、南蒂罗尔和西西里等地选举结果尚未完全揭晓而外，这次举行选举的全部地区中，意大利共产党所领导的人民集团共获得二百四十六万二千张选票，比一九四八年四月十八日大选时多得四十万零七千票。人民集团所获选票和总票数的比率，从一九四八年的百分之二十七增加到百分之三十三。但是天主教民主党所获选票则从一九四八年的百分之四十八跌到现在的百分之二十九，丧失选票竟达一百四十六万张之多。
    在罗马、那不勒斯和巴利等重要城市，人民集团的票数都大大增加，而天主教民主党的票数则大大减少。选举的结果是这样明显，甚至法新社都说：
    “人民阵线在任何地方都没有被击败，……天主教民主党是选举中的真正牺牲者。”
    使得天主教民主党遭到惨败的这次地方选举，本来定在去年秋季举行，是去年全国地方选举的一部分。加斯贝利的天主教民主党政府把它拖延到现在才举行，其中包含着不可告人的目的。原来在去年五、六月间意大利五十七省省、市政委员会选举和西西里区议会选举中，意大利共产党所领导的人民集团的选票高达总票数百分之四十，而天主教民主党则较之一九四八年丧失了二百五十万票。加斯贝利因为害怕他的天主教民主党会遭到更惨重的失败，就滥用职权，延期选举，同时并进一步依靠美国，加紧镇压人民，想以此巩固其统治。然而，一年来意大利政治形势的发展，却是对他越来越不利：一方面，人民要求和平与民主、反对战争与卖国的力量在迅速增长，甚至许多原来拥护依附北大西洋集团政策的人士如前首相尼蒂、奥兰多等，都转而拥护意大利共产党所提出的成立和平政府并立即举行大选的主张；另一方面，意大利统治集团，特别是天主教民主党内部的分裂，则日益加深，去年七月加斯贝利政府的辞职改组就是这种分裂达到无法弥补程度的结果。
    在这样的形势下，天主教民主党在一拖再拖而不得不举行这次选举时，就只有尽量利用连上院议长尼可拉都谴责为“所有选举制度中最不民主”的选举法，来夺取省、市政委员会的席位。例如，它夺取了罗马市政委员会八十席中的三十九席。而比它多得二万八千九百多张选票的人民集团反而比它少得了二十三席。它也用同样的方法保住了加拉勃利亚区和撒丁岛各省会、马特拉和波顿萨等城以及西西里许多城市中市政委员会的多数席位。此外，它更利用天主教会疯狂地为它竞选。梵蒂冈教皇亲自出来干涉，宣布教徒如果赞成共产党就是“犯罪”，“弃权就是叛教”，但是所有这一切阴谋诡计，都不能阻止意大利人民取得新的胜利。人民集团不但巩固了它在斐拉拉、特尔尼等五个省会市政委员会中原居多数的地位，赢得了罗马省和斯培西亚省省政委员会的多数席位以及贝斯加拉等省省政委员会的许多席位，而且在各地区六百多个大小城市中赢得了多数席位，其中一百九十个城市市政委员会的多数席是从天主教民主党手中取过来的。
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社罗马二十九日讯：意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂在答复“国家晚报”记者的问题时，就意大利最近举行的省、市政委员会选举结果发表评论。
    托里亚蒂在说明这次选举结果的政治意义时指出：共产党所领导的人民民主力量获得了巨大的、无可争辩的成功。它不但打退了执政党、法西斯分子和各“民政委员会”（天主教民主党人和教会当局的宣传组织）的各式各样的进攻，而且到处都大大向前迈进了一步。例如，在那不勒斯，仅仅共产党所获得的票数，就超过了人民民主阵线在一九四八年四月选举中所获得的全部选票。有许多地方，左翼所获得的票数增加了一倍以上。人民民主力量在意大利北部的地位和以前一样巩固，而且在逐渐增强。在意大利南部，劳动大众正在转向左翼的民主和社会主义力量这方面来；这就真正成了意大利复兴的开端。
    托里亚蒂指出：这次选举中法西斯分子在罗马和意大利南部的抬头是一个严重的因素。这使意大利
    一切民主分子和共和分子面临着许多重大的任务。他说：从意大利的经济情况和国际地位以及历来的传统看来，意大利的复兴与民主发展除了一条道路以外没有别的道路，这条道路就是它在反对法西斯主义、反对外国干涉、争取建立民主与共和制度的斗争中所走的道路。抛弃这条道路，就一定会使意大利遭到严重的国内危机，并使意大利从属于外国，从而危及意大利的和平。在这次选举中，在许多大农业中心，天主教民主党（执政党）是法西斯分子和保皇分子的同盟者，这个教会政党使用了法西斯集团的论据来反对民主力量。这种情况表明，目前整个统治阶级正在走向法西斯主义。意大利人民当然不能容许这样，而事实上这次选举也说明人民的力量将占上风，因为不论是在南部，在各岛，还是在北部，人民的力量都在越来越广泛有力地组织起来。
    托里亚蒂接着指出：今年和去年选举的结果已形成了国内政治力量的新对比。政府应该认识到它有责任赶快举行大选。今天的政府已不符合舆论的真正要求。托里亚蒂最后说：我们要立即开始工作，以巩固已经获得的成果，这种成果使我们更加相信意大利人民，更加相信他们能够前进而且能够更坚决地认定自己有权作国家唯一的真正主人。
