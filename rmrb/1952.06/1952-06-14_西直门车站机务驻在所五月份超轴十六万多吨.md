    Xizhimen Station Locomotive Depot Exceeds Axle Load by Over 160,000 Tons in May
    Editor: The employees of the Xizhimen Station Locomotive Depot in Beijing have actively launched a full-load, over-axle-load, and 500-kilometer movement. In May, the depot's fifteen small shunting locomotives exceeded the axle load by a total of 166,800 tons, accumulating over 430 million yuan in wealth for the country. The train crew on the ㄌ9 small locomotive, known as the "broken gong" due to its poor quality, also achieved good results in improving the locomotive's quality by studying the "Luning-style Locomotive Maintenance Method". The Yang Kechao team on locomotive ㄌ9-171 hauled 3,021 tons between Mentougou and Xizhimen, exceeding the original designed traction load of 2,190 tons by more than 831 tons, and arrived safely at the terminal station five minutes ahead of schedule. Driver Yang Kechao said, "Our hauling more and running faster is a practical action in response to the call for increased production and conservation."

    西直门车站机务驻在所五月份超轴十六万多吨
    编辑同志：北京西直门车站机务驻在所职工已经积极展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动。五月份全所十五台小型运转机车，共超轴十六万六千八百多吨，为国家积累财富四亿三千多万元。质量最差、被人称为“破锣”的攵ㄌ九小型机车上的乘务员，学习“鲁宁式机车保养法”，对提高机车质量，也有了很好的成绩。攵ㄌ九一七一号机车杨克超组在门头沟和西直门间，曾牵引了三千零二十一吨，超过原定牵引量二千一百九十多吨，还提前五分钟安全到达终点站。司机杨克超说：“我们多拉快跑，就是响应增产节约号召的实际行动。”  刘志忠
