(Xinhua News Agency) Following the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and concurrently with the unfolding production emulation movement, party and non-party cadres in party, government, military, and people's organizations throughout the North China region are launching a large-scale study movement of the history of the Chinese Communist Party.

This study movement began successively in various areas in June. Except for rural district cadres, who are focusing on studying agricultural production cooperation and mutual aid issues, all general cadres at the county level and above with a junior high school education or higher, up to senior cadres, are participating in the study of party history. Some cadres who are currently studying culture are also participating by listening to reports and lectures. This study movement is very large in scale. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 150,000 cadres in the region have already participated in the study. The learning steps are roughly as follows: first, one or two months are spent studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to initially transform one's way of thinking, thus obtaining a key to studying party history and Mao Zedong Thought. Cadres of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and various North China-level people's organizations have attended three classes on the study of "On Practice" and are currently conducting further research and discussion.

In order to closely integrate the theoretical study of on-the-job cadres with current work, this year's party history study in the region stipulates that the focus will temporarily be on Chairman Mao's theories on the Chinese bourgeoisie and the theory of new democratic economic construction.

Leading cadres in various areas are personally leading the study and formulating study plans. CPC provincial secretaries in Hebei, Chahar, and Pingyuan provinces are personally organizing senior cadres to study and guiding the study of general comrades with their own learning experiences. Yang Gengtian, secretary of the CPC Chahar Provincial Committee, and Yang Shijie, deputy secretary, are personally serving as lecturers at the Marxist-Leninist Night School directly under the Provincial Committee. Many responsible cadres at all levels are also serving as theoretical instructors. A large number of theoretical instructors and study tutors have also been established in various areas. Among the instructors who have already been trained, Hebei has 230, Shanxi has 226, Pingyuan has 77, Chahar has 57, and Suiyuan has held rotational training for propaganda ministers of CPC prefectural (league) committees. Tianjin has concentrated 300 bureau-level and equivalent cadres from the entire city to form a party history instructor research class, which studies on its own and serves as party history instructors. The number of study tutors is even greater. Hebei and Pingyuan have stipulated that one part-time study tutor should be set up for every 15 to 25 people. Tianjin has held training classes for study tutors, drawing 600 cadres with higher levels to conduct amateur study. While studying, they are tutoring the study of general agency cadres. According to current statistics, Hebei, Pingyuan, and Chahar provinces alone have 164 full-time instructors, approximately 2,000 part-time instructors in the North China region, and more than 4,000 study tutors. Hebei has also stipulated that leading cadres participating in the study should participate in the guidance of cadre study, give lectures, answer questions, and assist theoretical instructors and study tutors in their units. The Propaganda Department of the CPC Pingyuan Provincial Committee has also established a research group to specifically study and guide the study work on a regular basis. In addition, most provinces and cities have held party history radio lectures to guide cadres in remote areas to study in a timely manner. Some provinces and cities have held Marxist-Leninist night schools or amateur theory schools, and some are preparing to open special study columns in provincial and municipal newspapers and periodicals to provide guidance and assistance to everyone from various aspects. These measures have greatly strengthened the guidance work for theoretical study.

    华北全区干部展开学习党史运动
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，与开展生产竞赛运动同时，华北全区党、政、军及人民团体的党与非党干部，正在开展一个大规模的学习中共党史的运动。
    这一学习运动，于六月份在各地先后开始。除农村区干部以学习农业生产合作互助问题为中心外，所有县以上机关具有初中以上文化程度的一般干部，直至高级干部，都参加了党史学习。一部分正在学文化的干部，也参加听报告，听讲演。这次学习运动的规模很大，据不完全统计，全区目前已参加学习的干部约有十五万多名。学习步骤，大致先以一个月或两个月时间，学习毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”，初步改造自己的思想方法，为学习党史和毛泽东思想取得钥匙。中共中央华北局机关和华北级各人民团体干部对于“实践论”的学习，已上过三次课，目前正在作进一步的研究和讨论。
    为了使在职干部的理论学习能够紧密地结合当前工作，全区今年的党史学习，规定暂以毛主席关于中国资产阶级的学说和新民主主义经济建设理论为重点。
    各地领导干部都亲自领导学习，并订出学习计划。河北、察哈尔、平原等省的中共省委书记都亲自组织高级干部学习，并以自己的学习心得指导一般同志学习。中共察哈尔省委书记杨耕田、副书记杨世杰并亲自担任省委直属机关马克思列宁主义夜校讲师。各级负责干部担任理论教员的也很多。各地又设置了大量的理论教员与学习辅导员。其中已经过训练的教员，河北有二百三十人，山西有二百二十六人，平原有七十七人，察哈尔有五十七人，绥远轮训了中共地（盟）委宣传部长，天津集中了全市局、处长级及相当这一级的干部三百人成立了党史教员研究班，一面自修，一面担任党史教员。学习辅导员的数量更大。河北、平原均规定每十五人至二十五人设一兼职的学习辅导员。天津举办了学习辅导员训练班，抽调水平较高的干部六百人进行业余学习，他们一面学习，一面对一般机关干部的学习进行辅导。据目前统计，仅河北、平原、察哈尔三省有专职教员一百六十四人，华北全区兼职教员约在两千人以上，学习辅导员四千多人。河北并规定参加学习的领导干部，要参加干部学习的指导工作，担任讲课，解答问题，并帮助本单位的理论教员和学习辅导员。中共平原省委宣传部还成立了研究组，专门定期研究学习指导工作。此外，各省、市多数举办了党史广播讲座，及时指导边远地区的干部学习。有的省、市举办了马克思列宁主义夜校或业余理论学校，有的准备在省、市报刊上辟学习专刊，从多方面给大家以指导和帮助。这些措施，大大加强了理论学习的指导工作。
