    The Indian Unified Trade Union Congress Delegation, invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of their departure from Beijing:
    We, the Indian Unified Trade Union Congress Delegation that came to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, take this opportunity to thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for giving us the opportunity to visit New China.
    Our stay in New China has been filled with unforgettable impressions. The smiling faces of children, the radiant faces of boys and girls, and the proud expressions of the men and women who are engaged in building a new social order, will forever remain vivid in our memories. Our visits to places such as Shenyang, Nanjing, Yangzhou, the Huai River, Hangzhou, and Shanghai have provided us with an extraordinary experience. In these places we visited, we saw that the general public was working very actively.
    Wherever we went, we noticed that the general public was filled with unprecedented enthusiasm, and people were consciously and voluntarily contributing their utmost efforts to create their happy future. The psychological changes in people that have arisen with liberation are New China's greatest wealth.
    Land reform is New China's greatest achievement, and it has greatly changed the lives of farmers. The elimination of the landlord class and the distribution of landlords' property to the tillers of the land has liberated a huge amount of manpower. In Gao Kan Village, we saw landless peasants before liberation now proudly cultivating their own land. Smiling peasant women led us to visit the houses, warehouses, and fields that now belong to them. The distribution of land has fundamentally changed rural life.
    The situation of the working class has also been greatly improved. Wages have been increased, and welfare facilities have been increased many times over. We have seen many workers' dormitories, new houses, hospitals, sanatoriums, rest homes, clinics, nurseries, and reading rooms, which are all very remarkable. The Summer Palace in Beijing, the mansions in Hangzhou, and many other palatial buildings, which were formerly places of pleasure for the exploiters, have now become rest homes for the workers.
    The most important point is the role that workers play in managing production and implementing labor insurance regulations. We are very pleased to note that the People's Government is doing everything possible to improve the living standards of the working class and is striving to industrialize the country.
    We are very happy to have the opportunity to visit the Huai River project, and we can see the achievements that the people's enthusiasm will create as long as there is correct leadership. We see the masses of peasants engaged in building canals, dams, and sluices. The general public, whether young or old, is creating miracles in the absence of machinery and normal equipment.
    New China has also made great achievements in eliminating illiteracy. Many schools, adult literacy schools, and night schools have been opened throughout the country. The People's Government educates the people through cultural palaces, reading rooms, libraries, wall newspapers, songs, and dramas. We will never forget the scene of visiting the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace.
    We take this opportunity to thank the Chinese people for the warm hospitality they have shown us throughout our trip. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all the responsible comrades, translators, guides, and other personnel for their kindness and friendship shown to us throughout our stay in China. Finally, we would like to thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for their extremely warm hospitality and excellent arrangements during our trip.

### 印度统一工会代表团返国前发表谈话

    印度统一工会代表团返国前发表谈话
    【新华社三十日讯】应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的印度统一工会大会代表团，在离京回国前夕，发表书面谈话如下：
    我们来北京参加“五一”节的印度统一工会大会代表团，借这个机会感谢中华全国总工会能给我们机会到新中国来参观。
    我们逗留新中国的期间，是充满了令人难忘的印象的。儿童的笑脸，男孩和女孩光焕的面容，以及那些正从事于建设一个新社会秩序的男女们骄傲的神情，将永远鲜明地留在我们的记忆中。我们去沈阳、南京、扬州、淮河、杭州和上海等地的参观中，获得了一个异乎寻常的体验。在参观过的这些地方，我们看到一般老百姓都很活跃地工作着。
    无论我们走到那里，我们注意到一般老百姓都充满了空前的热情，人们都是自觉、自愿地为创造他们幸福的将来而贡献出他们最大的努力。随解放而产生的人们心理上的变化，是新中国最大的财富。
    土地改革是新中国最大的成就，它使农民的光景有了极大的改变。地主阶级的消灭以及将地主的财产分配给土地的耕种者，使巨大的人力获得了解放。在高坎村，我们看到解放前无地的农民现在很骄傲地在耕种他们自己的土地。面带笑容的农妇领着我们去参观那些今天已属于她们的房子、仓库和田地。土地的分配已经根本上改变了农村的生活。
    工人阶级的情况也大大地改善了。工资提高了，福利设施也增加了许多倍。我们看到了许多工人宿舍，新房子，医院，疗养所，休养所，诊疗所，托儿所以及阅览室，这些都是很了不起的。北京的颐和园，杭州的大厦以及其他许多宫殿式的建筑，以前这些都是剥削者淫乐的地方，现在都已变为工人的休养所了。
    最重要的一点是工人在管理生产和实行劳动保险条例中所起的作用。我们很高兴地注意到人民政府是在想尽各种办法提高工人阶级的生活水平，并竭力使国家工业化。
    我们很高兴有机会参观了淮河工程，我们看得出，只要那儿有正确的领导，人民的热情将会创造出怎样的成绩来。我们看到农民群众正从事于建造渠坝和水闸。一般老百姓，无论年青的或年老的在既无机器又无正常设备的条件下都正在创造着奇迹。
    新中国在扫除文盲方面也有很大的成绩。全国各地已开办了许多学校，成人补习学校及夜校。人民政府通过文化宫、阅览室、图书馆、墙报、歌曲和戏剧来教育人民。我们永远不会忘记去上海工人文化宫参观的情景。
    我们借此机会感谢中国人民在整个旅行中给予我们的热烈招待。我们并借此机会向所有的负责同志、翻译人员、向导及其他人员表示谢意，感谢他们在我们逗留中国的整个期间对我们表示的善意和友爱。最后，我们要对中华全国总工会给我们的极热忱的款待及旅行中极好的安排表示感谢。
