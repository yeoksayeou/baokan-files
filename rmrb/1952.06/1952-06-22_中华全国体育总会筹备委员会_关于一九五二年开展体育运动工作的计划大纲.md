    Plan Outline of the All-China Sports Federation Preparatory Committee on Carrying Out Sports Activities in 1952
    I
    In 1951, under the advocacy and leadership of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China, and with the active support of the Youth League and related agencies and organizations, the national sports undertaking achieved relatively widespread development through the promotion of national radio gymnastics, the organization of national basketball, volleyball, and football tournaments, large and small sports meets in various regions, and the promotion of "physical exercise standards" in various cities. A large number of activists emerged; sports institutions and grassroots organizations at all levels were gradually established, thereby preparing the conditions for the further development of the entire people's sports undertaking. The sports work in 1952 should be further popularized and appropriately improved on this basis and under the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, so that it becomes a more in-depth and regular mass activity. Therefore:
    1.  In carrying out sports activities, it is imperative to implement patriotic education of loving the motherland and defending the motherland, to enlighten the people to consciously and regularly participate in sports activities, thereby cultivating themselves into healthy, strong, brave, tenacious, agile, diligent, optimistic defenders and builders of the motherland with a spirit of collectivism.
    2.  In order to strengthen the mass character and regularity of sports activities, sports items that are beneficial to the comprehensive exercise and health of the human body, that can be universally participated in by the broad masses, and that require simple equipment or even no equipment, such as gymnastics, track and field, swimming, walking, mountain climbing, cross-country running, martial arts, weightlifting, wrestling, broadsword, and hand grenade throwing, should be regarded as the basic sports items to be promoted at present. These sports items should be popularized among the broad masses in urban and rural areas, so that the national physical strength, morality, and sports techniques (including other items such as ball games) can be comprehensively improved.
    3.  Sports activities must have a high degree of scientificity, and the training and practice of various sports must be carried out conscientiously according to scientific methods. At the same time, in conjunction with the development of sports activities, health education and publicity of hygiene knowledge should be regularly carried out to the broad masses.
    II
    Regularly carrying out sports competitions is an important method to promote the mass character and depth of sports activities. Therefore:
    1.  Localities can, according to specific circumstances, use all possible conditions to hold regular competitions with factories and workshops for workers, districts and villages for farmers, classes and schools for students, and platoons and companies for soldiers as units. In addition, sports competitions, performances, or regular ball game cup competitions can be held at the county and city levels.
    2.  Major administrative regions can hold sports meets with track and field events and gymnastics (freehand exercises and apparatus exercises) as the main events, with the entire region or province as the unit.
    3.  The National Swimming Competition will be held in Guangzhou in mid-September this year, and the Chinese National Style Sports Performance Conference will be held in Beijing in early October. All localities should do a good job in selecting and training athletes.
    4.  The Northeast, North China, Northwest, and other regions with suitable conditions can hold ice sports competitions and ski performances in winter.
    In carrying out sports activities, attention should be paid to and advocated sports items directly related to military affairs and national defense, such as hand grenade throwing, swimming, shooting, bayonet practice, equestrianism, aircraft models, bicycles, and motorcycles.
    III
    Gradually establish grassroots sports organizations and a sports system of "Preparation for Labor and Defense of the Motherland" to ensure the popularization, depth, and continuous improvement of sports activities:
    1.  At present, the sports system of "Preparation for Labor and Defense of the Motherland" should be implemented on a trial basis, and the trial items and standards will be announced by the All-China Sports Federation.
    2.  Establish grassroots sports organizations: Grassroots sports organizations are the organizational foundation for carrying out sports activities. In 1952, sports committees and various sports groups should be gradually established in each grassroots unit (such as factories, schools, and government agencies).
    IV
    The cultivation of sports cadres and activists is the decisive link in carrying out sports activities, so the following work must be started immediately:
    1.  Assist the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in preparing for the establishment of sports colleges to cultivate national sports professionals and train outstanding athletes in various sports.
    2.  Local sports associations should cooperate with local cultural and educational institutions, trade unions, military units, youth leagues, etc., to organize short-term training classes for sports activists of workers, soldiers, students, and government employees in their spare time, with learning the work of grassroots sports organizations and several sports techniques and rules as the main content, so that they can become voluntary instructors, referees, and organizers of grassroots sports organizations. The following methods can be adopted:
    	(1) Short-term training classes are attached to schools and people's stadiums with better sports equipment and teachers.
    	(2) Short-term training classes for amateur sports cadres of workers can be organized in industrial and mining enterprises.
    	(3) Short-term training classes for amateur sports cadres of students can be organized during holidays.
    3.  In order to strengthen the learning of existing sports workers and improve their political and ideological level and professional and technical level, it is recommended that cultural and educational institutions in various cities organize regular professional study meetings for primary and secondary school physical education teachers and cooperate with relevant institutions to organize study meetings for sports workers during winter and summer vacations.
    4.  It is recommended and actively assisted that relevant institutions adjust and strengthen existing sports professional training institutions, enrich the regular courses and add short-term training classes, and cultivate a large number of sports teachers and general sports cadres.
    V
    Improve sports institutions at all levels and do a good job in publicity:
    1.  The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has decided to convene the inaugural meeting of the All-China Sports Federation in June this year to formally establish the "All-China Sports Federation." In order to give play to and improve the organizational leadership role to meet the needs of the increasingly developing work, all localities should also gradually establish and strengthen sports institutions and work at all levels above the county and city levels.
    2.  Sports associations at all levels must publicize the importance of sports, the principles and tasks of sports activities, and the performance, content, and methods of various sports. This is an important task to enable the broad masses of people to regularly and correctly participate in sports activities.
    All possible means should be used for publicity, such as regularly organizing sports articles for newspapers, using newspapers to edit sports columns, using propaganda teams, propaganda vehicles, exhibitions, reports, radio stations, movies, pictures, wall charts, magazines, and publishing books.
    Publicity work should strive to be popularized to meet the requirements of the broad masses of the people.

    中华全国体育总会筹备委员会
    关于一九五二年开展体育运动工作的计划大纲
    一
    一九五一年全国体育运动事业在中央人民政府和中国共产党的提倡和领导下，在青年团及有关机关团体积极支持下，通过全国广播体操的推行，通过组织全国篮、排、足球的比赛会和各地的大小运动会，以及各城市推行“体育锻炼标准”等工作，获得了比较广泛的开展。积极分子大量涌现；各级体育机构及基层组织逐渐地建立起来；从而为整个人民体育事业进一步的发展准备了条件。一九五二年的体育运动工作应在这一个基础上与增产节约的原则下，进一步普及和适当地提高，使之成为更深入的经常性的群众活动。因此：
    一、在开展体育运动中必须贯彻热爱祖国和保卫祖国的爱国主义教育，启发人民自觉地经常地参加体育运动，从而培养自己成为健康、强壮、勇敢、坚毅、机敏、勤劳、乐观和具有集体主义精神的祖国的保卫者和建设者。
    二、为了加强体育运动的群众化与经常化，凡对人体全面锻炼和健康有益处、可以为广大群众普遍参加而且设备简单甚至不需设备的运动项目，如体操、田径、游泳、竞走、爬山、越野赛跑、武术、举重、摔跤、劈刀、掷手榴弹等，应作为目前推广的基本运动项目。这些运动项目应在城市与农村的广大群众中普及之，使得国民体力、道德与运动技术（包括其他项目如球类活动等在内）获得全面的提高。
    三、体育运动必须具有高度的科学性，各种运动的训练和练习必须认真地根据科学的方法进行。同时，结合体育运动的开展，应经常向广大群众进行健康教育和宣传卫生知识。
    二
    经常开展运动竞赛是促进体育运动群众化、深入化的重要方法。为此：
    一、各地可根据具体情况，利用一切可能条件举行工人以厂、车间，农民以区、村，学生以班级、校，战士以排、连等为单位的经常的比赛。此外还可以举行以县、市为单位的运动竞赛会、表演会或经常性的球类运动杯赛等。
    二、各大行政区可以全区或省为单位举行以田径赛及体操（徒手操及器械操）为主的运动会。
    三、本年九月中旬在广州举办全国游泳比赛大会，十月初在北京举办中国民族形式体育表演大会。各地应作好选拔与训练选手的工作。
    四、东北、华北、西北及其他有条件的地区可在冬季举办冰上运动比赛及滑雪表演。
    在开展体育运动中应重视和提倡与军事、国防直接有关的运动项目，如掷手榴弹、游泳、射击、劈刺、骑术、飞机模型、自行车、摩托车等项运动。
    三
    逐步建立体育基层组织及“准备劳动与保卫祖国”的体育制度，以保证体育运动的普及、深入和不断地提高：
    一、目前应重点试行“准备劳动与保卫祖国”的体育制度，由中华全国体育总会公布试行项目及标准。
    二、建立体育基层组织：体育基层组织是开展体育运动的组织基础，一九五二年内应按各基层单位
    （如工厂、学校、机关）逐步建立体育委员会和各种运动小组。
    四
    体育干部与积极分子的培养，是开展体育运动的决定环节，因此必须立即着手进行以下工作：
    一、协助中央人民政府教育部筹办体育学院，培养全国体育专业干部和训练各项运动的优秀运动员。
    二、各地体育分会应协同当地文教机关、职工会、部队、青年团等利用业余时间，分别组织工人、战士、学生、机关职员的体育积极分子短期训练班，以学习体育基层组织工作及几项运动技术与规则为主要内容，使他们成为体育基层组织的义务指导员、裁判员和组织工作者，可采取下列几种方式：
    （一）在体育设备和师资较好的学校及人民体育场附设短期训练班。
    （二）工矿企业中可组织工人业余体育干部短期训练班。
    （三）利用假期组织学生业余体育干部短期训练班。
    三、为要加强现有体育工作者的学习，提高他们的政治思想水平和业务技术水平，建议各城市文教机关组织中小学体育教员经常的业务学习会和配合有关机关利用寒暑假，组织体育工作人员学习会。
    四、建议并积极协助有关机关调整和加强现有的体育专业训练机构，充实正科并增设短期训练班，大量培养体育师资及一般体育干部。
    五
    健全各级体育机构并作好宣传工作：
    一、中华全国体育总会筹备委员会决定在今年六月召开中华全国体育总会成立大会，正式成立“中华全国体育总会”。为了发挥和提高组织领导作用以适应日益开展的工作的需要，各地亦应逐渐建立与加强县、市以上的各级体育机构及工作。
    二、各级体育分会必须宣传体育的重要性、体育运动的方针、任务和各项运动的性能、内容及方法等，这是使广大人民群众经常地正确地参加体育运动的重要工作。
    应采用一切可能采用的方式进行宣传，如经常为报纸组织体育稿件，利用报纸编辑体育栏，利用宣传队、宣传车、展览会、报告会、广播电台、电影、画片、挂图、杂志和出版书籍等。
    宣传工作应力求通俗化以切合广大人民群众的要求。　（新华社）
