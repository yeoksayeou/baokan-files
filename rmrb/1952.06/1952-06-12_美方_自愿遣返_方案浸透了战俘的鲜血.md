Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 11th: Just as the U.S. representatives refused to come to Panmunjom for a meeting for the third consecutive day, the U.S. military carried out a bloody suppression of prisoners of war. This makes clear one of the ulterior motives for Harrison's forced adjournment. According to U.S. sources, U.S. paratroopers, using guns, grenades, and tear gas, and supported by flame-throwing tanks, massacred defenseless male and female prisoners of war held by the U.S. The U.S. troops, under the cover of tanks, charged with "gleaming bayonets" at unarmed prisoners of war who had been without food for many days—including a nine-year-old child. Then, the U.S. troops stripped the prisoners of their clothes and "drove them into new prison camps." Harrison fled the conference table to escape these cruel facts.

This is the "first step" of the "big operation" boasted by Bonner, the American official in charge of Death Island, to American reporters. Massacre, bloodshed, and intolerable humiliation—this is the fate of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in this U.S. crime performance arena that has drawn the attention of the world. All of this happened before the eyes of American reporters. These American reporters inhumanely turned away when the prisoners of war wanted to tell them about their terrible fate. It is not difficult to imagine the crimes committed by the American aggressors against prisoners of war detained on the Korean mainland under the cover of a strict news blockade.

The massacre and bloodshed of prisoners of war have become synonymous with "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation." This massacre is the inevitable result of the trampling of the Geneva Convention. This convention has clear provisions for the repatriation of prisoners of war, because historical wars have proved that prisoners of war are under the control of those who capture them, so the right of prisoners of war to return to their country must be strictly guaranteed. When prisoners of war are locked in barbed wire cages, under the guns and bayonets of the enemy, talking about "free will" and "voluntary choice" is simply mocking the prisoners of war.

This is the so-called "firm, final, and unchangeable" U.S. proposal, soaked in the blood of prisoners of war, that Clark is using to deceive the world. Well-informed sources here say that if the war planners in Washington think that arrogant threats and provocative actions to interrupt the meeting can make the Korean and Chinese representatives accept this blood-soaked proposal, then a big surprise awaits them. These people pointed out that American generals, who are accustomed to bullying their vassals and massacring unarmed prisoners of war, should know that rogue tactics at the conference table will not work. They also said that if Harrison returns to the conference table due to public criticism, he should also realize that the only way to break this serious deadlock is to abandon the "firm, final, and unchangeable" nonsense and properly resolve the prisoner of war issue through equal negotiations at the conference table. There is no other way to achieve a truce in Korea.

### 美方“自愿遣返”方案浸透了战俘的鲜血

    美方“自愿遣返”方案浸透了战俘的鲜血
    【新华社开城十一日电】就在美方代表连续第三天拒绝来板门店开会的时候，美军对战俘实行了血腥镇压。这就使哈利逊强行休会的一个不可告人的原因大白于世了。根据美方自己的消息，美国伞兵部队使用枪、手榴弹和催泪弹，在喷射火焰的坦克的支援下，对被美方拘留的赤手空拳的男女战俘进行屠杀。美国军队在坦克掩护下用“闪光的刺刀”向手无寸铁、断粮多日的战俘——其中还有一个九岁的儿童——冲锋。接着，美国军队就把战俘的衣服剥下来，“把他们驱入新的囚舍中”。哈利逊从会议桌上逃走就是为了逃避这些残酷的事实。
    这就是死亡岛上的美国负责人波纳向美国记者吹嘘的“大行动”的“第一步”。遭受屠杀、流血和不可容忍的侮辱——就是在这个全世界瞩目的美国罪行表演场上的朝中战俘的命运。这些都是在美国记者的眼前发生的。这些美国记者在战俘们要向他们诉说自己的可怕命运的时候，却毫无人性地转身不理。美国侵略者在严密的新闻封锁的掩护下对被拘留在朝鲜大陆上的战俘犯下的罪行，也是不难想像的。
    战俘的被屠杀与流血已经成了“自愿遣返”与“不得强迫遣返”的同义语。这种屠杀是日内瓦公约遭到蹂躏的必然后果。这个公约对于遣返战俘是有明确的规定的，因为历史上历次战争都证明了：战俘是处在俘掳他们的人的掌握之下，因此战俘返国的权利必须加以严格的保障。当战俘被关在有刺铁丝网的牢笼里，处在敌人的枪口与刺刀尖下的时候，空谈“自由意志”与“自愿选择”，简直就是嘲弄战俘。
    这就是浸透了战俘的鲜血而被克拉克拿来向全世界招摇撞骗的所谓“坚定的、最后的、不可变更的”美方方案。此间消息灵通的人士说：如果华盛顿的战争策划者以为蛮横的威胁与中断会议的挑衅行动能够使朝中代表接受这个浸透了鲜血的建议的话，那叫他们大吃一惊的事情就在前面等着他们。这些人士指出：惯于对他们的附庸们作威作福、屠杀赤手空拳的战俘的美国将领们应当知道，在会议桌上耍流氓的手段是吃不开的。他们还说：如果哈利逊因舆论的指摘而回到会议桌上来的话，他还应当认识：打开这种严重的僵持局面的唯一办法就是放弃“坚定的、最后的、不可更改的”那一套废话，好好在会议桌上以平等的谈判来解决战俘问题。要在朝鲜停战，旁的道路是没有的。
