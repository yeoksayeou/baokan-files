    The broadcasting services for ethnic minorities have greatly developed in the past two years. Up to now, national People's Broadcasting Stations with ethnic minority language broadcasting programs include the Central, Southwest, Inner Mongolia, Yanbian, and Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Stations.

    The Central People's Broadcasting Station has successively added Mongolian, Korean, and Tibetan language broadcasting programs since 1950. These three programs are broadcast on more than three wavelengths respectively; each broadcasts once a day, each time for half an hour. The Second Station of Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station and Yanbian People's Broadcasting Station are specially established ethnic broadcasting stations. The main broadcasting target of the Second Station of Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station is the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups in the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The main broadcasting target of Yanbian People's Broadcasting Station is the Korean ethnic group in Yanbian Prefecture. In addition to broadcasting the Tibetan language program of the Central People's Broadcasting Station every day, the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station has also been running a Tibetan language program once a week, each time for half an hour, since 1951. The Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station has three hours of Uyghur language programs every day, accounting for more than one-third of the station's total broadcasting time. In addition, the Yunnan People's Broadcasting Station is actively training cadres who can broadcast in the languages of ethnic minorities such as Miao, Yi, Lolo, and Minjia, and has begun to pilot minority language broadcasting stations on ethnic minority market days to broadcast to the ethnic minority people who attend the markets.

    In the past two years, the radio receiving networks in ethnic minority areas have also developed significantly. For example, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, except for Duolun, Baochang, and Huade counties in Chahar League, 63 full-time or part-time radio operators have been developed in other agricultural areas, pastoral areas, and along railway lines in various banners, counties, and cities; 44 radio operators have been developed in government agencies and factories in Ulanhot City; and some banners and counties have even expanded to districts. In Yanbian area, all leagues and banners in Suiyuan Province, and counties and banners inhabited by ethnic minorities in Gansu and Ningxia provinces in the Northwest Region have established radio receiving stations. Qinghai Province, where the Tibetan people account for a large proportion of the population, has established 20 radio receiving stations in special districts and counties. Xinjiang Province has established nine special district radio receiving stations and 37 county radio receiving stations. In Guizhou Province in the Southwest Region, where the Miao people account for a large proportion of the population, 97 radio receiving stations have been established in eight special districts and 79 counties throughout the province. Yunnan Province, where ethnic minorities account for more than half of the population, has established 106 radio receiving stations.

    All areas where radio receiving stations have been established use broadcast materials to conduct extensive publicity through various forms (such as publishing mimeographed newspapers and blackboards), which has achieved good results.

    Broadcasting in ethnic minority languages has been welcomed and loved by the people of all ethnic minorities from the very beginning. In Naiman Banner, Zhelimum League, eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a loudspeaker was installed on the street, and 100 to 200 listeners listen to the broadcast every day; often, herdsmen ride horses for ten to twenty miles to listen to the broadcast. In Taizu Banner, Chahar League in the west, a radio was once brought to the countryside, and more than 2,000 herdsmen were organized to listen to it. After hearing the broadcast, many ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province said, "When the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, our words and the tunes of our songs were considered local dialects and local tunes, and they were considered inferior. Today it is different. Our words and tunes can also be broadcast. This is the benefit that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have given us."

    少数民族广播事业两年来有很大发展
    全国少数民族广播事业近两年来有很大发展。到目前为止，全国设有少数民族语言广播节目的有中央、西南、内蒙、延边、新疆等五个人民广播电台。
    中央人民广播电台从一九五零年起先后增设了蒙古语、朝鲜语和西藏语广播节目。这三种节目分别用三个以上波长播送；每天各播音一次，每次为半小时。内蒙古人民广播电台第二台和延边人民广播电台是专门建立的民族广播电台。内蒙古人民广播电台第二台的主要广播对象是内蒙古自治区东部的蒙、汉民族。延边人民广播电台的主要广播对象是延边专区的朝鲜民族。西南人民广播电台除每日转播中央人民广播电台的西藏语节目外，并自一九五一年起举办了每星期日一次，每次半小时的藏语节目。新疆人民广播电台每天有三小时维吾尔语节目，占该台全天播音时间的三分之一强。此外，云南人民广播电台已在积极训练能以苗、彝，倮倮、民家等少数民族语言进行广播的干部，并开始在少数民族的赶集日期，试办少数民族语言广播站，向赶集的少数民族人民广播。
    两年来，少数民族地区的广播收音网也有了显著的发展。如内蒙古自治区，除察哈尔盟的多伦、宝昌、化德三县外，其他农业区、牧业区及铁路沿线的各旗、县、市已发展了专职或兼职的收音员六十三名；乌兰浩特市的机关、工厂中发展了收音员四十四名；部分旗、县并已发展到区。延边地区，绥远省各盟、旗，西北区甘肃、宁夏等省少数民族居住的县、旗，已全部建立了收音站。藏族人民占人口很大比重的青海省已建立了专区、县收音站二十处。新疆省已经建立了九个专区收音站、三十七个县收音站。西南区苗族人民占人口很大比重的贵州省，全省的八个专区、七十九个县建立了九十七个收音站。少数民族人民占人口一半以上的云南省已建立收音站一百零六处。
    凡已建立广播收音站的地区，都利用广播材料通过各种形式进行扩大宣传（如出刊油印报、黑板报），收到良好效果。
    少数民族语言的广播一开始就受到各少数民族人民的欢迎和热爱。内蒙古自治区东部哲里木盟奈曼旗街上装了一个扩音机，每天收听广播的听众有一、二百人；常有牧民骑马跑一、二十里赶去收听广播。西部察哈尔盟太左旗有一次收音机下乡，组织了两千多牧民收听。云南省很多少数民族在听到广播后都反映说：“在国民党反动派统治的时候，我们讲的话，唱歌的调子，都被人认为是土话、土调子，是下贱的。今天不同了，我们的话和调子也能广播了。这是毛主席和共产党给我们的好处。”    （新华社）
