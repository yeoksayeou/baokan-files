    The Beijing Tenth District Farmers' Quick Literacy Class Conducts Extensive Reading in This Way
    Tu Guang
    After the intensive character learning phase in the quick literacy class, it is essential to engage in extensive reading of farmers' literacy textbooks, language textbooks, and popular books and newspapers. Reading plays a decisive role in whether the learned characters can be consolidated. Through reading a large number of books and newspapers, students can increase their knowledge, broaden their horizons, improve their thinking, and develop their ability to express their thoughts in writing. This will further cultivate students' learning habits and enable them to organize book stations, reading groups, etc., after the entire quick literacy method teaching is completed.
    How does the Beijing Tenth District Farmers' Quick Literacy Class conduct reading? It can be roughly divided into four stages: The first stage is reading the farmers' literacy textbook and the elementary language textbook, which takes 30 hours. The second stage is reading the textbook for the second time, which takes 24 hours. The third stage is guiding students to write sentences through reading the text, which takes 12 hours. The fourth stage is reading popular books and newspapers, which takes 14 to 20 hours (the latter two stages can also be combined).
    The purpose of reading the textbook for the first time is to enable students to "move" all the characters they learned during the intensive study. In this stage, the emphasis should be on students' self-study and mutual assistance, and on giving play to the advantages of adults' strong comprehension, judgment, and association abilities. The students said: "We roughly guess and rush forward; if it's right, it's right, if it's wrong, we correct it." Such students make rapid progress. Sometimes they read one or several extra characters, and sometimes they read one or several characters less. They even read a word as a word with the same meaning, such as reading "厕所 (cèsuǒ, toilet)" as "茅房 (máofáng, outhouse)." This can all be ignored, and they can gradually correct it through repeated reading. However, some students, when encountering an unfamiliar character, stop reading as if they have encountered a roadblock, and develop the thought that "I still can't read." At this time, the group leader and teacher must be patient and helpful, and should not be impatient or complain. They can let students with similar abilities help each other, and inspire them to associate. For example, when student Liu Yulan read "全世界一共有二十万万人 (quán shìjiè yīgòng yǒu èrshí wàn wàn rén, the whole world has 2 billion people)," she only recognized "——一——有二十——人 (——yī——yǒu èrshí——rén, ——one——has twenty——people)." The teacher asked her, "Is it 二十百百人 (èrshí bǎi bǎi rén, twenty hundred hundred people)," or "二十千千人 (èrshí qiān qiān rén, twenty thousand thousand people)?" She said, "No, it's 二十万万人 (èrshí wàn wàn rén, twenty ten-thousand ten-thousand people)." The teacher then asked her, "Then, one 'what' has 二十万万人 (èrshí wàn wàn rén, twenty ten-thousand ten-thousand people)?" She thought for a while and said, "一共有二十万万人 (yīgòng yǒu èrshí wàn wàn rén, has a total of twenty ten-thousand ten-thousand people)." The teacher asked her, "Then, what place has 二十万万人 (èrshí wàn wàn rén, twenty ten-thousand ten-thousand people)?" She thought for a long time but couldn't answer. Finally, the teacher told her, "全世界一共有二十万万人 (quán shìjiè yīgòng yǒu èrshí wàn wàn rén, the whole world has 2 billion people)." She then asked, "什么是世界 (shénme shì shìjiè, What is the world)?" The teacher did not tell her, but asked her to continue reading. Using the same method, she quickly read three lessons, encountering "全世界 (quán shìjiè, the whole world)" seven times. At this time, she recognized the characters and understood the meaning. This example fully illustrates the characteristics of adults' strong comprehension and rich vocabulary. On the basis of students' self-study, the teacher gives slight guidance, and they will quickly remember it. Otherwise, if the student asks a question and the teacher or group leader hurriedly tells him the answer, without letting him use his own brain to think, the effect will be poor. We have found that students who were taught using the latter method still did not recognize many characters when reading the textbook for the second time.
    During the first reading of the textbook, the most difficult thing is reading the second and third volumes of the farmers' literacy textbook, and texts with content that is not very familiar to them. Because at this time the number of characters read is less than 20,000, and the repeated characters do not appear frequently, and the meaning is not understood, they are ambiguous about the pronunciation of many characters, and they are not very enthusiastic about reading. At this time, students often become nervous and sweat, and the teachers need to strengthen guidance and encouragement.
    The second reading of the textbook is the easiest. Because after the first reading, the number of characters read has reached more than 70,000, and the frequently repeated characters appear seventy or eighty times, and the less frequent ones also appear thirty or forty times. Generally, they will not mispronounce them again. The purpose of this reading is to consolidate the pronunciation, master the character shapes, be able to read in sentences, expand the vocabulary, enrich the meaning of the characters, and understand the content. The method is: the teacher reads aloud, the top students lead the reading, and teach the students to recognize four types of punctuation marks, namely periods, commas, exclamation marks, and question marks, and gradually enable the students to read in sentences. When encountering texts with good content, discussions can be launched; when encountering unfamiliar characters or words, a brief explanation should be given, and the explanation should not be separated from the text. When students mispronounce words again, they should be corrected. If a certain number of unfamiliar characters are accumulated, they can be intensively learned again to eliminate "troublesome characters," and help should be strengthened for students who performed slightly worse in the first reading.
    After reading 40,000 characters in the literacy textbook, single characters can be copied or dictated. Writing should be coordinated with reading the elementary language textbook. At this time, the students generally have mastered the character shapes. After the teacher briefly teaches the writing method, the students do not feel too difficult to copy or dictate. When writing characters according to radicals, students should be taught how to use the dictionary, laying a favorable foundation for the next step of reading popular books and newspapers. When teaching how to use the dictionary, two methods can be taught at the same time: one is to look up characters by radical, and the other is to look up characters by pronunciation.
    The purpose of the third reading is to guide students to practice writing. The method is to focus on explaining texts with language knowledge content, and guide students to read other texts and popular books and newspapers related to the language knowledge being taught. Through reading a large number of texts or books and newspapers, students further understand the language knowledge being taught, and in turn guide their writing. The general order of writing development starts with simple practical writing, such as IOUs, notices, letters of introduction, diaries, lost and found notices, announcements, letters, etc. According to the experience of Xin Si Village and Dongba, the students generally write very well, and learning to write letters becomes a movement, with one letter reaching three or four hundred words. At this time, based on the problems existing in students' writing, basic writing knowledge can be taught by focusing on explaining the language textbook, so that students can then write autobiographies, news articles, stories, etc.
    In the process of reading popular books and newspapers, we have discovered the following situations:
    First, when they start reading, students prefer to borrow picture books and comic strips. In this type of books, students prefer to write the words outside the pictures, such as the popular comic strips published by the Dazhong Pictorial Publishing House; they do not like to write the words inside the pictures, such as the picture books distributed by the People's Book and Newspaper Supply Agency. The students' reaction to the latter is: "The words are written inside the pictures, and you don't know who is saying them; it's a mess, and you can't see it clearly." In terms of content, young people like labor model and hero stories, such as "Li Shunda," "Chicken Feather Letter," and "China-Korea Friendship." Women like books about marriage issues, such as "Jin Bao Niang" and "Xiao Erhei's Wedding." After reading picture books and comic strips for four or five days, general students ask to read something deeper and no longer borrow picture books and comic strips.
    Second, when reading popular readings, students prefer poems, clapper talks, or popular literary works with large characters, vertical writing, regular script, and wide line spacing. For example, "Wangjiazhuang Celebrates Liberation" and "General Kim Il-sung," students can read five or six copies in one hour, about 5,000 characters. The students' favorite is a set of "Workers' and Peasants' Books" published by the People's Publishing House (most of which are works by workers and peasants, reflecting the mass struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the three years since the founding of the country, and the form is also popular with the masses; this book is worth promoting universally). In terms of popular newspapers and periodicals, students like to read "China Youth Daily" and "North China People's Daily." For example, after reading "China Youth Daily," student Su Wenxiu from Gaobeidian went everywhere to find the teacher to continue borrowing. Chen Wenlan, Chen Shuqin, and others asked to subscribe after reading "North China People's Daily." In addition, students like to read popular literary works with four or five thousand characters, such as "Heirloom," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," and "I Let Him Pile Grain Like a Mountain." The Current Affairs Small Series published by the Youth Publishing House is also widely welcomed. Some students, after reading this series, asked to study politics. After reading these readings, students gradually can read small-print lead-printed readings, especially works with strong political and ideological content.
    Through this stage of reading, we have two experiences:
    First, the number of characters intensively learned is best at 1,800.
    "Workers' and Peasants' Books" are about 4,000 characters each, and the students can recognize more than 95% and understand the content.
    Second, literacy education and language education can be carried out consistently in quick literacy teaching. That is, when intensively learning characters, it includes both characters in the literacy textbook at the elementary school level and characters in the language textbook at the higher elementary school level. The characters in the two textbooks are less than 2,000, and the total number of characters in the textbooks exceeds 70,000. Only after learning the language textbook can the students' reading and writing abilities be truly improved and consolidated.
    In addition, we also ask writers and the publishing industry to study the quick literacy method and publish popular readings that are truly suitable for the workers and peasants, so that the workers and peasants can further obtain more cultural and scientific knowledge from popular readings after learning with the quick literacy method.

    北京市第十区农民速成识字班是这样进行大量阅读的
    土光
    在速成识字班突击学习生字阶段结束以后，必须展开大量阅读农民识字课本、语文课本和通俗书报的活动。因为学得的生字能否巩固，阅读起着决定性的作用。学员从阅读大量的书报中可以增加知识，开拓眼界，提高思想，锻炼用文字表达自己思想的能力；进而培养学员的学习习惯，使他们在速成识字法全部教学结束后，能够组织起图书站、读报组等。
    北京市第十区农民速成识字班是怎样进行阅读的呢？大体上可以分作四个阶段：第一阶段是读农民识字课本和初级语文课本，需时三十小时。第二阶段是第二次阅读课本，需时二十四小时。第三阶段是通过阅读课文，指导学生写话，需时十二小时。第四阶段是阅读通俗书报，需十四小时至二十小时（后面两个阶段也可以合并）。
    第一次读课本的目的，在于使学员能把突击过的生字“大搬家”。在这一阶段，要强调学员的自学互助，发挥成年人理解力、判断力、联想力强的优点。学员们说：“大约摸着往下冲，冲对就对，冲不对再改。”这样的学员就进步得快。他们有时多念一个或几个字，也有时少念一个字或几个字的。甚而把一个词念成含义相同的词，如“厕所”念成“茅房”。这都可不管，让他在反复阅读中去逐步纠正。但是也有些学员，碰着不认识的字，像碰见拦路虎一样，就停下来不念，产生“我还是不能念书”的思想。这时，小组长及教师千万要耐心帮助，不可急躁，说怨言。可以让和他差不多的学员在一起互助，并启发他去联想。如学员刘玉兰念到“全世界一共有二十万万人”时，只认识“——一——有二十——人。”教师便问她是“二十百百人”，还是“二十千千人”？她说：“不是，是二十万万人。”老师又问她：“那么，一‘什么’有二十万万人？”她想了想说：“一共有二十万万人。”老师又问她：“那么，什么地方有二十万万人？”她想了好大会，也答不出来。最后，教师才告诉他“全世界一共有二十万万人”。她又问“什么是世界”？教师没有告诉她，叫她往下念。用同样的方法，很快地念了三课，遇见了七次“全世界”。这时，她把字也认下，意思也懂了。这个例子充分说明了成人理解力强、语汇丰富的特点，教员在学员自学的基础上，略加指导，她就会很快地记住。不然，如学生一问，教员或小组长就赶忙告诉他，不让他自己动脑筋思考，效果就差。我们曾发现用后一种方法教过的学生，到第二次阅读课本时，还有好多字不认识。
    在第一次阅读课本时，最困难的是读第二、三册农民识字课本，和内容对他们不大熟悉的课文。因为这时阅读的字数不到两万字，重复的生字出现得不多，意思又不懂，他们对很多字音是含糊的，念起来劲头不大。这时，学生往往神经紧张得冒汗，教员要特别加强辅导和鼓动工作。
    第二次读课本最容易。因为经过第一次阅读以后，阅读字数已达七万多字，生字重复次数多的在七、八十次，少的也有三、四十次，一般的都不至于再读错音。这一次阅读的目的，是巩固字音，占有字形，能读成句，扩大词汇，丰富字义，了解内容。方法是：教员范读，优等生领读，并教学员认识四种标点，即句点、逗点、惊叹号和问号，逐渐地使学生也能读成句了。碰到内容好的课文，可以展开讨论；碰到不懂的字或词，要简明地讲解一次，讲时不可离开课文。学生再有念错字音的时候，要予以纠正。不认识的字凑到一定数目，可以再突击认识一下，以消灭“捣蛋字”，对第一次阅读稍差的学生，要加强帮助。
    读完识字课本四万字后，可以抄写单字或听写。写字应和读初级语文课本相配合。这时，学员一般地已占有了字形，教师简单地教了写字方法之后，学员抄写或听写并不感到太困难。在按偏旁、部首写字时，应教学生怎样查字典，给下步阅读通俗书报打下有利的基础。教查字典时，可同时教两种方法：一是按部首检字，一是按音检字。
    第三次阅读的目的，是指导学生练习写话。方法是通过重点讲解有语文知识内容的课文，指导学员阅读其它课文和与所讲语文知识有关的通俗书报。通过阅读大量课文或书报，学员进一步领会所讲的语文知识，反过来指导写作。写作发展的顺序，一般的开始是写简单的应用文，如借条、通知、介绍信、日记、招领、告白、书信等。根据辛四村、东坝的经验，学员一般写得很好，学写信成为运动，一封信能写三、四百字。这时，可根据学员写作中存在的问题，通过重点讲解语文课本，告诉学员一些基本的写作常识，使学员进而能写自传、通讯、故事等。
    在阅读通俗书报过程中，我们发现了如下的情况：
    第一，开始阅读时，学员好借阅小人书及连环图画。在这一类图书中，学员喜欢把字写在图外的书，如大众图画出版社出版的大众连环图画；他们不喜欢把字写在图内的书，如人民书报供应社发行的小人书。学员对后者的反映是：“字写在画里头，也不知道谁说的，乱糟糟的，看不清楚。”在内容上，青年人喜欢劳动模范和英雄故事，如“李顺达”“鸡毛信”“中朝友爱”等。妇女喜欢有关婚姻问题的书，如“金宝娘”“小二黑结婚”等。一般学员看了四、五天小人书和连环图画后，就要求看更深的东西，不再借阅小人书和连环图画了。
    第二，在看通俗读物时，学员喜欢字大、竖写、楷字、行间宽的诗歌、快板或通俗文艺作品。如“王家庄庆翻身”“金日成将军”等，一小时内学员可以看五六本，约五千字。学员最喜欢的是人民出版社出版的一套“工农的书”（其中绝大部分都是工农同志的作品，内容是反映抗日战争、解放战争以及建国三年来的群众斗争，形式又是群众所喜闻乐见的，这书值得普遍推广）。在通俗报刊方面，学员最喜欢读“中国青年报”、“华北人民”，如高碑店学员苏文秀看过“中国青年报”后，到处找老师，继续借阅。陈文兰、陈淑勤等看过“华北人民”后要求订阅。此外，学员很喜欢看有四五千字长的通俗文艺作品，如“传家宝”“王贵与李香香”“我让他粮食堆成山”等。青年出版社出版的时事小丛书也普遍受到欢迎，有些学员看了这套丛书，要求学习政治。学员读了这些读物之后，逐渐能读字小的铅印读物，特别是政治性、思想性较强的作品。
    通过这一阶段阅读，我们有两点体会：
    首先，突击生字的字数以一千八百字为最好。
    “工农的书”大约都在四千字左右，学员们都能认识百分之九十五以上，内容都能了解。
    其次，识字教育和语文教育，在速成识字教学内，可以一贯进行。即突击生字时，既包括相当初小程度的识字课本中的生字，也包括相当高小程度语文课本中的生字，两种课本中的生字不到两千字，课本总字数超过七万字。学完语文课本后，才真正能使学员的阅读及写作能力提高一步，并得到巩固。
    另外，我们也要求作家及出版界研究速成识字法，出版真正适合工农群众的通俗读物，使工农群众经过用速成识字法学习后，进一步地从通俗读物中获取更多的文化科学知识。
