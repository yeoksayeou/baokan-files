The Red Cross movement has a long history in Russia. The Russian nurses' detachment of Crimea, headed by the surgeon Pirogov, was the prototype of the Russian Red Cross, much earlier than the relief movement for wounded and sick soldiers initiated by the Swiss citizen Henry Dunant. However, the Red Cross in the Tsarist era served the bourgeoisie, with no more than 30,000 members. After the victory of the October Revolution, the Red Cross, led by proletarian ideology, was first established in the Russian Socialist Republic. In 1918, according to a decree signed by Lenin, the Russian Red Cross Congress was held on the basis of Soviet democratic principles, and the constitution of the new Red Cross was formulated. Subsequently, the sixteen republics of the Soviet Union successively established their own Red Cross organizations, which are generally called Red Cross societies in most countries, and Red Crescent societies in countries that believe in Islam. In 1932, the first Soviet Red Cross Congress was held, establishing the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union. Under socialist leadership, the Soviet Red Cross developed very rapidly. In 1926, it had only 75,000 members. In 1934, it reached 5 million. During the Great Patriotic War, it had as many as 12 million members. Today, the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union has more than 15 million members and more than 230,000 branches. Moscow alone has 700,000 members.

The Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union is a mass health and first aid organization established on a voluntary basis. It is a capable assistant to the government's health departments in mobilizing and organizing the masses to do their own health work. It uses the vast number of Red Cross members to form various types of health, first aid, and medical prevention teams, and cooperates with health agencies to popularize health campaigns, becoming a powerful tool for the Soviet people to organize and use their own strength to improve and raise their health levels. On the other hand, it has a clear division of labor with the Ministry of Health. All medical and health undertakings are organized by the Ministry of Health, while the Red Cross plays a supplementary and implementing role. In addition, it also accepts specific tasks entrusted by the health departments.

The general task of the Soviet Red Cross is to educate the people with the spirit of combining internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary humanitarianism, and to develop the people's health and mutual assistance movement. In each historical stage, its specific tasks are determined according to the different actual needs. For example, the constitution passed by the 1918 Congress stipulated that the main tasks of the Red Cross were five: ① establishing mass organizations; ② repatriating prisoners of war; ③ disinfection and epidemic prevention; ④ relief of refugees; ⑤ international liaison. After 1925, the international situation deteriorated, and the Soviet Union faced the threat of military aggression. It took on the important task of developing grassroots organizations, carrying out first aid and public health training, and strengthening national health protection. Particularly noteworthy is the significant contribution of the Soviet Red Cross during the Great Patriotic War: from 1941 to 1945, it trained a total of 23 million health prevention team members, which played a major role in the rescue of Red Army soldiers and people subjected to air raids, as well as the prevention of infectious diseases. It raised 25 million rubles from its members to build the air force for the Soviet Red Army, and raised more than 1 million daily necessities and hundreds of thousands of books for wounded soldiers' hospitals. About 17,000 Red Cross blood donors received the "Honorary Blood Donor of the Soviet Union" award. In 1951, the Soviet Red Cross stipulated new basic tasks: encouraging the working people of the whole country to strive to improve their health, helping the victims of war and natural disasters, and cooperating with the Red Cross societies of various countries to establish lasting international peace. In general, the Soviet Red Cross tried its best to mobilize and organize the vast masses to learn and take on certain health work in peacetime, and became an unlimited reserve force for national defense health work in wartime.

The organization of the Soviet Red Cross takes members as cells and establishes grassroots organizations in various enterprises, farms, agencies, schools, and streets. At the state and district levels, in the various republics, and even at the Soviet central level, committees are established at all levels. Any Soviet citizen, generally from the age of sixteen, and students from the age of twelve, can voluntarily apply to join the Red Cross as a member.

The basic work of the Soviet Red Cross is to organize the masses. Its main business can be summarized as follows:

First, propaganda work: The main task is to publicize the socialist humanitarian ideals to the masses, and to educate members to have Soviet patriotism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. At the same time, it uses blackboard newspapers, propaganda paintings, expert speeches, and other methods to publicize health and national defense. There are currently thousands of propaganda groups throughout the Soviet Union, with 15,000 speakers.

Second, health training work: The Soviet Red Cross has two basic health training courses, one run by grassroots organizations and the other implemented in schools. The main contents are: the tasks of the Red Cross, the physiological structure of the human body, first aid, home care, and protection against poison gas. People who have received health training can participate in health stations and health teams to take on certain health work. According to statistics, from July 1941 to July 1945, a total of 22.5 million adults and 6 million school children participated in training, and there were 250 organized rescue teams in Moscow alone.

Third, health service work: Generally, it carries out first aid, nursing, cleaning, safety, epidemic prevention, and other service work without leaving production; and develops community health and home care work. The main method is to organize health stations, inspect residences, public dormitories, factories, schools, barber shops, and bathhouses, publicize health knowledge, reduce illness and industrial injuries, and assist medical personnel in engaging in active prevention work. According to 1945 statistics, there were a total of 254,100 such health stations. After the war, it was also planned to establish a medical "center" in every collective farm. According to 1946 statistics, there were a total of 12,000. In addition, the Soviet Red Cross is also committed to organizing blood transfusions, assisting medical work, and promoting the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of saving lives and healing the wounded; it also accepts specific tasks entrusted by the health departments in specific areas: such as cancer prevention, epidemic prevention, and prevention and treatment of endemic diseases.

Fourth, relief work: The Soviet Red Cross carries out relief work for people who have suffered from war disasters in wartime; in peacetime, it carries out relief work for the elderly, young, and lonely. Such as relief for war disabled, families of martyrs and soldiers, and orphans, and handling natural disaster relief, etc. For example, in 1949, the Ukrainian Red Cross had 418 orphanages, 75 nurseries, and 68 war disabled homes, assisting the social departments of various republics to restore useful labor to 80% of the disabled. After World War II, the number of orphanages sponsored by the Soviet government also increased several times. The Soviet Red Cross, through its grassroots organizations, established supervisory committees in each orphanage to perform supervisory and guiding responsibilities. In terms of natural disaster relief, the Soviet Red Cross has also greatly assisted in carrying out work, such as the drought in the Volga region from 1921 to 1922, which provided daily relief to 300,000 people; in addition, it has also made many contributions in terms of medical rescue in disaster areas.

Fifth, youth work: It aims to educate young people to have the spirit of internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary humanitarianism, and to cultivate young people's health and cultural habits. "School Work Committees" are established in Red Cross organizations at all levels, including representatives from government education and health departments, the Communist Youth League, and schools, teachers, and doctors, to guide the work of school Red Cross societies. Currently, 80% of schools above the fourth grade in the Soviet Union have Red Cross organizations, and 55% of students are Red Cross members, totaling more than 5 million.

It is particularly noteworthy that the Soviet Red Cross promotes its work by cultivating activists to participate in various Red Cross organizations and activities in their spare time and launching socialist competitions.

Based on the above outline introduction, we can clearly see that the cause of the Soviet Red Cross is completely different from the hypocritical philanthropy of capitalist countries; it is based on the broad masses, faces the needs of the broad masses, and implements the lofty principles of socialist humanitarianism and democracy, creating unparalleled outstanding contributions and brilliant achievements for world peace and human welfare.

We are confident that the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Red Cross today are foreshadowing the victorious tomorrow of the New China Red Cross!

    介绍苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会
    红十字运动在俄国具有悠久的历史，以皮洛格夫外科专家为首的俄国护士克里米大队是俄国红十字会的雏形，远较瑞士公民亨利·杜南发起伤病战士的救济运动为早。但帝俄时代的红十字会是为资产阶级服务的，最多不过三万余名会员。在十月革命胜利后，无产阶级思想领导的红十字会首先在俄罗斯社会主义共和国创立。一九一八年根据列宁签署的法令，在苏维埃民主原则的基础上，举行了俄罗斯红十字大会，制定了新红十字会的章程。嗣后苏联十六个加盟共和国都相继成立了自己的红十字会组织，在一般国家内称为红十字会，在信奉回教的国家内称为红新月会。一九三二年召开第一次苏联红十字大会，成立了苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会。苏联红十字会在社会主义领导下，发展非常迅速。一九二六年会员仅七万五千人，一九三四年已达五百万人，卫国战争中会员多至一千二百万人；今天苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会拥有会员一千五百余万人，分支会二十三万余个，仅莫斯科一市即有七十万名会员。
    苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会是建立于志愿基础上的群众卫生救护团体，它是协助政府卫生部门发动与组织群众做好自己的卫生工作的得力助手。它以广大的红十字会会员组成各种各类的卫生、救护和医防小组，配合卫生机关，普及卫生运动，成为苏联人民有组织地运用自己力量，改善和提高卫生水平的有力工具。但另一方面它与卫生部又有明确的分工，一切医疗卫生事业，均由卫生部主办，红十字会则起辅助与贯彻作用。另外它也接受卫生部门委托的特定工作。
    苏联红十字会的总任务是以国际主义、爱国主义与革命人道主义相结合的精神教育人民，发展人民的卫生和互济运动，而在各个历史阶段中，则根据实际需要之不同规定其特定的具体任务。例如一九一八年代表大会通过的会章规定红十字会的主要任务有五：①建立群众组织；②遣送俘虏；③消毒防疫；④救济难民；⑤国际联络。一九二五年后国际局势恶化，苏联面对军事侵略的威胁，它就担负起发展基层组织，开展急救和公共卫生训练，加强国家卫生防护的重要任务。特别显著的是苏联红十字会在卫国战争期间作了重大贡献：从一九四一年到一九四五年共训练了二千三百万名卫生预防队员，对红军战士和遭受空袭人民的救护，以及传染病的预防，都有很大作用。它从会员方面募集了二千五百万卢布给苏联红军建设空军，又为伤兵医院募集了一百多万件日常必需品和几十万本书籍，约有一万七千名红十字输血者获得了“苏联荣誉输血者”的奖励。一九五一年苏联红十字会又规定了新的基本任务：鼓励全国劳动人民为提高健康水平而努力，救助战争和天灾的受难人员，与各国红十字会合作建立国际间的持久和平。总的说来，苏联红十字会在平时尽量发动与组织广大群众每个人学习与担任一定的卫生工作，在战时就成为国防卫生工作的无限后备力量。
    苏联红十字会的组织以会员为细胞，在各企业、农庄、机关、学校和街道建立基层组织，在州和区，各加盟共和国以至苏联中央各级设立各级委员会。凡是苏联公民，普通由十六岁起，学生由十二岁起，可以志愿申请加入红十字会为会员。
    苏联红十字会的基本工作是组织群众，目前它的主要业务可归纳为下列各项：
    第一、宣传工作：主要任务在向群众宣传社会主义的人道主义理想，并教育会员们具有苏联爱国主义和无产阶级的国际主义精神，同时利用壁报宣传画、专家讲话等方式，宣传卫生国防。全苏现有数千个宣传组，讲演人一万五千。
    第二、卫生训练工作：苏联红十字会设有两种基本卫生训练课程，一种由各基层组织创办，一种在学校里实施。其主要内容为：红十字会任务、人体生理构造、急救、家庭护理、防毒。受过卫生训练的人可参加卫生站和卫生队两种组织，担任一定的卫生工作。据统计，一九四一年七月至一九四五年七月共有二千二百五十万成年人、六百万学校儿童参加训练，有组织的救护队仅在莫斯科市就有二百五十队。
    第三、卫生服务工作：一般进行不脱离生产的急救、护理、清洁、安全、防疫等服务工作；并展开居民卫生和家庭护理工作。主要方式在于组织卫生站，检查住宅、公共宿舍、工厂学校、理发所及浴堂，宣传卫生常识，减低病患和工业性外伤，协助医务人员从事积极预防工作。据一九四五年统计，此类卫生站共有二十五万四千一百个。战后并计划在每一个集体农场内设立一个医务“中心”，据一九四六年统计，共有一万二千个。此外苏联红十字会又致力于组织输血，协助医疗工作，发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神；同时也接受卫生部门所委托的特定地区的特定任务：如防癌、防疫、防治地方病等。
    第四、救济工作：苏联红十字会在战时对遭受战灾的人民进行救济工作；在平时则对老幼孤独等进行救济工作。如救济战争残废者，烈、军家属和孤儿，办理自然灾难救济等。例如乌克兰红十字会一九四九年办有孤儿院四百十八处，育婴院七十五处，卫国战争残废院六十八处，协助各共和国社会部使百分之八十的残废人员恢复了有用的劳动。第二次世界大战后，苏联政府主办的孤儿院亦增加数倍，苏联红十字会通过其基层组织，在每个孤儿院成立监察委员会，执行监督和指导的责任。在自然灾难的救济方面，苏联红十字会也大力协助进行，如一九二一年至一九二二年旱灾，在伏尔加河区每日救济三十万人；此外在灾区医疗救护方面，也有很多贡献。
    第五、青少年工作：旨在教育青少年具有国际主义、爱国主义和革命人道主义的精神，并培养青少年卫生文化的习惯。各级红十字会组织中设立“学校工作委员会”，包括政府教育、卫生部门，青年团和学校的代表，教员及医生等，以指导学校红十字会工作。目前全苏联百分之八十的四年级以上学校都有红十字会组织，百分之五十五的学生是红十字会会员，总数达五百余万人。
    特别值得注意的是苏联红十字会推动工作的方法，在于培养积极分子业余参加红十字会的各项组织与活动，并发动社会主义竞赛。
    根据上面轮廓的介绍，我们就可以看清楚苏联红十字会的事业和资本主义国家虚伪的博爱主义完全不同；它以广大群众为基础，面对广大人民的需要，贯彻了社会主义的人道主义和民主主义的崇高原则，对世界和平和人类福利创造出无比的卓越贡献和光辉成就。
    我们确信苏联红十字会今天的辉煌成就正预示着新中国红十字会胜利的明天！
