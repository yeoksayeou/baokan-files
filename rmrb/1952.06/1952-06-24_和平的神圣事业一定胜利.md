    The Sacred Cause of Peace Will Surely Triumph
    Angelina, Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union, Member of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace
    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Angelina, is the first female tractor driver in the Soviet Union, a renowned Hero of Socialist Labor, a delegate to the Supreme Soviet, and a member of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace. Her works "The Most Important Thing" and "On the Fields of the Collective Farm" are beloved by Chinese readers. This article was written specifically for this publication to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression.
    Peace—this precious word—is resonating more and more powerfully across all continents of the world. People of goodwill, of different ages and professions, of all skin colors, speaking the languages of all nations, are repeating this word with hope and confidence.
    Hundreds of millions of people, led by the great Soviet Union, are united into a powerful and unbreakable camp of peace supporters. All those who have a sincere heart and are willing to save the world from new suffering, poverty, and destruction are in this camp.
    The movement for peace—the most powerful and invincible movement of modern times—is growing and expanding day by day. Freedom-loving humanity is watching the Soviet Union—a strong fortress of peace—with the greatest hope. The thoughts and aspirations of millions of ordinary people are directed towards Comrade Stalin, the great leader of all nations and the foremost champion of world peace.
    We, the Soviet people, are people of peace and labor. We do not need the land and wealth of others. We dedicate all our strength to making our beloved motherland more beautiful and stronger.
    Throughout our vast motherland, from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, from the frigid Arctic to the warm Colchis, the intense and creative labor of the Soviet people is seething. This labor is for peace and happiness on earth, for a noble purpose—communism.
    In our Soviet Union, on the Volga River and the Dnieper River, on the Don River and the Amu Darya, the greatest construction projects are underway. We are covering our country with protective forest belts, building irrigation canals, and turning deserts into flourishing gardens.
    We do not want war! We need peace to engage in construction and creation.
    But the achievements of our peaceful labor, our confident pace towards communism, have aroused the frantic and bestial hatred of the doomed capitalist camp. The American imperialists, harboring sinister plots to dominate the world, have openly become fanatical instigators of a new world war. American militarists are frantically building military airfields, entangling many countries with dense networks of military bases, and expanding their aggression in the Far East.
    The American aggressors have been waging a war of aggression against the peace-loving Korean people for two years. Under the guise of the United Nations flag, Truman's bandits have committed heinous and bloody crimes on Korean soil.
    The enemy, who thought they would "succeed" quickly, was greatly mistaken. The Korean People's Army has put up a heroic resistance to the interventionists. The entire brave Korean people have risen up to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland. The People's Volunteers of freedom-loving China have also come to the aid of the glorious fighters of the Korean People's Army.
    Neither the barbaric bombing from the air and the shooting from the sea, nor the use of barbaric weapons of mass destruction—bacteriological and chemical weapons—can destroy the strong will of the Korean people.
    The insidious and vicious enemy has not ceased. New news about the horrific and bloody atrocities committed by the American aggressors against the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island and in Busan has spread throughout the world.
    The American cannibals—the executioners—have embarked on the path of Hitler's tyranny, the path of bloody massacres. On Geoje Island, "Gestapo" men in American uniforms have revived the horrors of Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Buchenwald [Note]. The American interventionists have turned the once peaceful Korean Geoje Island into an island of death.
    When the Soviet people read the reports from Geoje Island, indignation and anger enveloped them. These reports pointed out how the American barbarians, using the methods of Hitler's executioners, carried out the most violent and appalling tortures against the Chinese and Korean prisoners of war. The bloody tortures committed by the American interventionists against unarmed people pursue one goal—to force Korean and Chinese patriots to betray their motherland and become traitors.
    But the absurd plans of the American imperialists will not be realized!
    The bestial acts of American militarism have aroused the unanimous anger of all peace-loving nations. The voice of the entire Soviet people resounds powerfully, and they, together with all the people of the world, demand: an end to the barbaric persecution of prisoners of war, an end to the aggressive and plundering war in Korea!
    The voice of us, the mechanics of the Staro-Peschanovsky Machine Tractor Station in the Stalin Oblast, is completely consistent with the demands of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity.
    We participate in the cause of consolidating world peace through our patriotic, Stakhanovite labor in the fields of our beloved collective farms.
    The machines of peaceful labor are roaring from dawn to dusk on the Donets steppe. We believe that the rumble of tractors and combines surpasses the rumble of tanks, because people's lives need peace, not war, food, not shells and bombs!
    We are working for peace, life, and happiness, sparing no effort. Our well-groomed and cultivated fields, the lush and dense winter wheat growing vigorously, the deep green of the technical crops planted in the spring that will yield a bumper harvest—this is our contribution to the cause of fighting for peace, in the cause of striving to strengthen the power and glory of our beloved socialist motherland.
    We express our warm and fraternal solidarity with the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are waging a just war against the American interventionists, and at the same time, we firmly believe that the brave Korean people will defend the freedom and independence of their motherland. We firmly believe that the sacred cause of peace will surely triumph, because it is defended by hundreds of millions of people on earth, and it is defended by Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people. And where Stalin is, there is victory!

    [Note] The "Gestapo" was Hitler's secret police. Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Buchenwald were the locations of concentration camps of fascist Hitler during World War II.

    和平的神圣事业一定胜利
    苏联社会主义劳动英雄苏联保卫和平委员会委员安格林娜
    编者按：本文作者安格林娜是苏联第一名女
    拖拉机手、著名的社会主义劳动英雄、最高苏
    维埃代表、苏联保卫和平委员会委员。她的著
    作“最主要之点”和“在集体农庄田野上”，
    是中国读者所热爱的。这篇文章是她为纪念朝
    鲜反侵略战争两周年特为本刊写的。
    和平——这个珍贵的字眼——在全世界各大洲上愈来愈有力地响着。意志善良的人们，不同年龄和职业的、各种肤色的、说着各民族的语言的人们，都充满希望和信心地重复着这个字。
    数以亿万计的人们，以伟大的苏联为首，团结成强有力的、牢不可破的拥护和平阵营。所有那些人——有一颗真诚的心，愿意拯救世界使它免受新的痛苦、贫困和毁坏的人们，都在这个阵营之中。
    争取和平的运动——现代最有力的、不可战胜的运动——一天天增长着、扩大着。爱好自由的人类以最大的希望注视着苏联——强大的和平堡垒。成千成万的普通人的思想和渴望，都朝向各民族人民伟大的领袖、世界和平的第一位旗手——斯大林同志。
    我们，苏联人，是和平与劳动的人们。我们不需要别人的土地和别人的财富。我们供献出全部力量，为了使我们可爱的祖国变得更美丽和更强盛。
    在我们辽阔的祖国各地，从波罗的海到太平洋，从严寒的北极到炎热的科尔希达，沸腾着苏维埃人的紧张的创造性的劳动。这种劳动是为了大地上的和平与幸福，为了一个崇高的目的——共产主义。
    在我们苏联，在伏尔加河和第聂伯河，在顿河和阿姆河，正在进行着最伟大的建筑工程。我们把自己的国家铺上防护林带，建筑起灌溉运河，把沙漠变成繁盛的花园。
    我们不要战争！我们需要和平，为了从事建设和创造。
    但是我们的和平劳动的成就，我们充满信心地走向共产主义的步调，却引起了必遭灭亡的资本主义阵营的疯狂的、野兽般的仇恨。美国帝国主义者心怀着统治世界的罪恶阴谋，公开地成为新世界战争的狂热的煽动者。美国军国主义热狂地建筑着军用飞机场，用稠密的军事基地网缠绕住许多国家，扩大着在远东的侵略。
    美国侵略者对爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行侵略的战争，已经二年了。杜鲁门的强盗们在联合国的旗帜掩盖下，在朝鲜的土地上犯下了骇人听闻的血腥罪行。
    认为很快便能“成功”的敌人，是大错特错了。朝鲜人民军对干涉者进行了英勇的抵抗。全体勇敢的朝鲜人民，都挺身而起，保卫祖国的自由和独立。爱好自由的中国的人民志愿军也来援助朝鲜人民军的光荣战士们。
    无论是空中的野蛮轰炸和海上来的射击，无论是采用大规模杀害人的野蛮武器——细菌武器和化学武器，都不能摧毁朝鲜人民坚强的意志。
    奸险的凶恶的敌人并没有停息。关于美国侵略者在巨济岛和釜山对朝中战俘所做的可怖的血腥暴行的新消息，飞遍了全世界。
    美国的食人者——刽子手们已走上希特勒暴政的道路，走上血腥屠杀的道路。在巨济岛上，穿着美军制服的“盖世太保”们，又复活了奥斯威辛、麦丹尼克和布痕瓦尔德〔注〕的恐怖。美国干涉者已把曾是和平的朝鲜巨济岛变成了死亡岛。
    当苏联人民读到从巨济岛来的报道时，愤懑和忿怒笼罩了他们。这些报道指出，美国野蛮人怎样以希特勒刽子手的方法，对中朝战俘进行了最狂暴的骇人听闻的拷打。美国干涉者对手无寸铁的人们所干的血腥折磨，追逐着一个目的——迫使朝中爱国者背弃祖国，成为叛徒。
    但是美帝国主义者的妄诞计划，是不会实现的！
    美国军国主义的兽行，引起了全体爱好和平各民族的一致愤怒。全体苏维埃人民的呼声强有力地响着，他们和世界全体人民共同要求：结束对战俘的野蛮迫害，结束在朝鲜的侵略的掠夺的战争！
    我们，斯大林州斯塔罗—彼舍夫斯基机器拖拉机站的机械师们的呼声，是和苏联各民族和全体进步人类的要求完全一致的。
    我们以自己在亲爱的集体农场田地上的爱国主义的、斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动，来参加巩固世界和平的事业。
    和平劳动的机器，在顿尼茨的草原上从清早到深夜轰响着。我们相信：拖拉机和康拜因机的轰隆声胜过了坦克的轰隆声，因为人们的生活需要和平，而不需要战争，需要粮食，而不需要炮弹和炸弹！
    我们为了和平、生活和幸福而劳动着，不吝惜自己的力量。我们的良好的、加了工的田地，茁壮地长起来的稠密的冬麦，春天种下的将获丰收的技术作物的深绿色——这就是在争取和平斗争的事业中，在争取加强亲爱的社会主义祖国的威力和光荣的斗争事业中的贡献。
    我们对进行着反对美国干涉者的正义战争的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，表示热烈的兄弟般的团结一致的意愿，同时我们坚决相信，勇敢的朝鲜人民会保卫住自己祖国的自由和独立。我们坚决相信，和平的神圣事业一定战胜，因为保卫它的是地球上的数亿人民，保卫它的是劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志。而斯大林在那里，那里就是胜利！
