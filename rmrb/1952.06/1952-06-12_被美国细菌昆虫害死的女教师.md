Female Teacher Killed by American Germ-Carrying Insects

Cai Tianxin

On March 27th, many large flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and false ground beetles were suddenly discovered in Liu’erbao Town, Liaoyang…

At that time, the weather was still very cold. Although the snow had all melted, the ground still froze at night. Where could so many strange insects breed from!

“These were scattered from the sky by American devils in airplanes!”

People immediately concluded.

Liu, an elderly woman and military dependent of the People's Volunteer Army living in the courtyard of the First Complete Elementary School, testified: "I am a daughter of Liu'erbao. I grew up, got married, toiled, and raised my children in this town. Now I am in my fifties or sixties, and I have never seen such flies, mosquitoes, and spiders in this area. The American devils want to harm our people. These wolves know they can't win the war in Korea, so they are attacking us in the rear! We must quickly eliminate these poisonous insects!"

Under the urgent mobilization and active leadership of the town government, the masses of Liu'erbao immediately launched a campaign to eliminate the poisonous insects.

Wang Shuzhi, a female teacher who lived in the same room as Liu, was the grade teacher for the sixty-four students in Class 3 of the second grade at the Complete Elementary School. Half a month earlier, she had been paying close attention to the news in the newspapers about the American imperialists conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. In the classroom, she explained to the children the heinous crimes of the American devils. Now, germ-carrying insects had fallen into the schoolyard. How directly they threatened the lives of all the students in the school! For the safety of the students, to protect the lives of the innocent and lively children, she was determined to eliminate the poisonous insects and not let them spread germs. Thinking this, she actively participated in the insect extermination work.

On April 8th, an unfortunate event occurred.

After the school bell rang, the students sat quietly in the classroom, waiting for Teacher Wang Shuzhi to come and teach the Chinese language class. Teachers from other classes had already entered the classrooms. The sounds of "Stand up, salute, sit down" from the class monitors were heard one after another. The teachers all began their lessons. But their Teacher Wang Shuzhi had not come.

Five minutes, ten minutes passed. The younger students were getting impatient and began to talk in low voices.

Everyone was puzzled. Since Teacher Wang had been their grade director for more than a year, she had never been absent or late for class. Could it be that she had forgotten that this was her Chinese language class? Some students suggested that the class monitor, Xu Chunfu, go to the teachers' office to take a look. When the class monitor went out, everyone thought: Teacher Wang will be here soon.

But, unexpectedly, the class monitor also did not return. A long time passed, but no one spoke, all waiting. After a while, Xu Chunfu returned, his face tearful. He said with a sob: "Teacher Wang has fainted, let's all wait a little longer!"

"Teacher Wang was just fine a moment ago. How could she have fainted in such a short time?" said a female student named Hu Xiuying worriedly.

"Ah! Could it be related to the poisonous insects scattered by the American devils?" another boy named Zhao Shouzhen added.

The children's innocent minds naturally associated it with this, but none of them wanted to think about it further…

Another half an hour passed, and it was almost time for the end of class. Everyone could not wait any longer, so they asked the class monitor to inquire again. The end of class bell rang, but no one wanted to leave the classroom. Sixty-four pairs of eyes were all looking outside the classroom door. Before long, they saw the class monitor Xu Chunfu walking back, his face covered in tears. As soon as he entered the door, everyone asked: "What happened?"

Xu Chunfu wiped away his tears with the back of his hand, sobbing as he said:

"Teacher Wang... is dead."

This was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, hitting the children's hearts. Could this be possible? Just a little over an hour ago, Teacher Wang, who had been smiling, would leave them forever in such a short time? This was something their young minds had never imagined!

At this moment, Head Teacher Huang walked into the classroom. In a low voice, he announced to everyone: "Your most beloved Teacher Wang has died, and her body has been taken away. After examination by doctors from the county, it was found that there was a lot of bleeding in her brain. This kind of illness has never been seen in our area. She was killed by the American devils' germ-carrying insects..."

The children cried all together when they heard Head Teacher Huang's words. They all felt that they had lost a lovely and kind person. Their Teacher Wang was very healthy, how could such a person die so suddenly? As they cried, they could not help but hate the American devils. At this time, the child Zhao Shouzhen, wearing a red scarf, stood up with his chest out and said loudly: "Everyone, don't cry, what's the use of crying? Teacher Wang was killed by the poisonous insects scattered by American airplanes. We should avenge Teacher Wang!"

"Yes! I won't cry. I will study hard, oppose the American imperialists' germ warfare, and avenge Teacher Wang!" said another girl named Huang Xiufang.

Zhao Shouzhen led everyone in shouting slogans: "Oppose American Imperialism!"

"Avenge Teacher Wang!"

The children all raised their fists and shouted.

Autopsy examination by pathologist Professor Wu Zaidong has confirmed that Wang Shuzhi's illness was acute anthrax, hemorrhagic meningitis. For more than twenty years, Professor Wu Zaidong has dissected six thousand corpses, and has never found such a disease. Since the American imperialists spread poisonous insects, in just over twenty days, three such patients have been continuously discovered, and Wang Shuzhi was one of them. This fully shows that Wang Shuzhi's death was caused by the poisonous insects spread by the American imperialists. All the teachers of the Complete Elementary School remember that Wang Shuzhi was the most active and bravest fighter against the American imperialists' germ warfare. For the sake of the children, she fearlessly disregarded her own safety. All the children of the Complete Elementary School have a clearer understanding of how the American imperialists inhumanely took the life of their most beloved female teacher. The military dependent Liu mumbles to everyone she meets: "The American devils are so cruel! Such a lively person, in less than an hour and a half, died foaming at the mouth. How much sin have the American devils committed! A young and useful person, dead just like that, how can it not break your heart! She died, leaving behind the sixty-some children in her class, who seem to have no support at all, crying just like motherless children… I asked someone to write a letter to my son Shoushan in Korea a few days ago, telling him that the American devils had spread poisonous insects in our Liu'erbao, and killed our Complete Elementary School teacher Wang Shuzhi, who lived in the same room as me. Let him beat the American devils hard and avenge the children's Teacher Wang….”

Teacher Wang's death had a great impact on the children. Since Teacher Wang's death, the students in this class have been studying better and better every day. Even the students who used to be more naughty do not make trouble anymore. They encourage each other with the words Teacher Wang had said.

"Study hard, be worthy of Teacher Wang, and avenge Teacher Wang!" has become a slogan for the children to encourage each other.

    被美国细菌昆虫害死的女教师
    蔡天心
    三月二十七日，辽阳刘二堡镇突然发现了很多大苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛和伪步行虫……
    那时天气还很冷。雪虽然都化了，但一到晚间，地面上还照样上冻，从什么地方会滋生这么多的怪虫子呢！
    “这是美国鬼子用飞机从天上撒下来的呀！”
    人们一下子就断定了。
    住在第一完全小学院子里的人民志愿军军属刘老大娘这样证明着说：“我是刘二堡的姑娘。长大、结婚、下苦力，把孩子抚养成人，都在这个堡子里。如今我活了五六十岁了，在咱这地方，从来就没见过这样的苍蝇、蚊子和蜘蛛，这是美国鬼子要祸害咱们的人哪。他们这些狼，知道在朝鲜的仗打不赢了，才在咱们的后方下毒手！咱们要赶紧扑灭这些毒虫呵！”
    在镇人民政府紧急动员和积极领导下，刘二堡的群众立刻展开了消灭毒虫的运动。
    和刘大娘同屋住的女教员王淑芝，是完全小学二年三班六十四名学生的级任老师。她在半个月以前，就很注意报纸上登载的美帝国主义在朝鲜和东北进行细菌战的消息。在课堂上，她给孩子们讲解了美国鬼子的这种滔天罪行。现在，细菌昆虫就落在学校院子里来了，它们是怎样直接威胁着这全校学生的生命呵！为了学生的安全，为了保护天真活泼的孩子们的生命，她决心把毒虫消灭干净，不能让它们传染细菌。她这样想，就积极地参加了灭虫工作。
    ×  ×  ×
    四月八日，不幸的事情发生了。
    上课铃响过以后，同学们安安静静地坐在课堂里，等王淑芝老师来上国语课。别的班的老师都进教室了。值日生喊立、礼、坐的声音陆续地传过来。教员们都开始讲课了。他们的王淑芝老师却没有来。
    五分钟，十分钟过去了。小一点的学生等得有些不耐烦了，开始小声谈起话来。
    大家都很纳闷。王老师担任他们的级主任以来，已经有一年多了，从来没有缺过课，也从来没有迟到过；今天，莫不是她忘了这一堂是她的国语课？有的同学提议，推班长徐春福到教员室去看一下。当班长走出去时，大家想：这回王老师可快来了。
    但，出乎意外，班长也一去不回。时间过了很久，可没有一个人出声，都在等。过了好一会，徐春福回来，他哭丧着脸说：“王老师迷糊过去了，咱们大家再等一会吧！”
    “王老师刚才不还是好好的吗？怎么这一会就迷糊过去了呢？”那个叫胡秀英的女学生耽心地说。
    “啊呀！不是和美国鬼子撒的毒虫有关系吧？”另一个叫赵守振的男孩子接着说。
    孩子们天真的心灵里很自然地就联想到这点了，但他们谁也不愿再想下去……
    又过了半点钟，眼看着快要下课了，大家等得实在不行了，就又让班长去打听。下课铃响了，谁也不愿出教室。六十四双眼睛都向教室门外望着。不一会，就看着班长徐春福满脸眼泪地哭着走回来。一进门，大家劈头就问：“怎么的了？”
    徐春福一边用手背擦眼泪，一边抽咽着说：
    “王老师……死了。”
    这好像晴天里的一声霹雳，打在孩子们的心上。这是可能的吗？就在一点多钟以前，还笑容满脸的王老师，就会在这么短的时间里永远地、最后地离开他们了吗？这是他们的幼小心灵从来没有想到的呵！
    就在这个时候，黄教导主任走到教室来了。他用低沉的声音向大家宣布说：“你们大家最亲爱的王老师已经死了，她的遗体已经运走了。经县里来的医生检查，发现她的脑子里出了很多血。这种病咱这地方没见过，她是被美国鬼子细菌昆虫害死的……”
    孩子们听了黄教导主任的话，一齐哭起来。他们都感到自己失掉了可爱可亲的人。他们的王老师的身体是很健康的，这样一个人怎会一下子死掉呢？他们哭着、哭着，不由得就仇恨起美国鬼子来了。这时，那个系着红领巾的孩子赵守振挺着胸脯站起来大声说：“大家别哭了，哭有什么用处呢？王老师是被美国飞机撒下来的毒虫害死了，咱们应该给王老师报仇！”
    “对！我不哭了，我要好好学习，反对美帝国主义的细菌战，给王老师报仇！”另一个叫黄秀芳的女孩子说。
    赵守振领着大家喊口号：“反对美帝国主义！”
    “给王老师报仇！”
    孩子们一齐举起拳头，呼喊着。
    ×  ×  ×
    经病理学家吴在东教授解剖检查，已证实王淑芝的病是急性炭疽性、出血性脑膜炎。二十多年来，吴在东教授解剖了六千多尸体，从未发现过这种病症。自美帝国主义撒布毒虫后，仅二十多天，就连续发现了三个这样的病人，王淑芝就是其中的一个。这充分说明王淑芝的死是被美帝国主义撒布的毒虫害死的。完全小学的全体教员都记得：王淑芝是反对美帝国主义细菌战最积极和最勇敢的战士。她为了孩子，奋不顾身。完全小学的全体孩子们都更清楚地认识了美帝国主义是怎样惨无人道地夺去了他们最亲爱的女教师。军属刘老大娘一见人就叨咕：“美国鬼子的心真狠呀！那么活生生的人，不到一点半钟，就口吐白沫死了。美国鬼子该犯了多大罪孽呀！一个年轻有用的人，说死就死了，怎不叫人心痛！她死了，留下她班上的六十几个孩子，就好像没一点依靠了似的，哭得真像没有娘的孩子一样……我前两天已经让人写信给我在朝鲜的儿子寿山了，告诉他说美国鬼子在咱们刘二堡撒下了毒虫，把和我一屋住的咱们完小的女教师王淑芝给害死了。让他狠狠地打美国鬼子，给孩子们的王老师报仇。……”
    王老师的死，对于孩子们的刺激是很大的。从王老师死后，这班学生的学习一天比一天更好。连过去比较好调皮的学生都不闹了。他们都用王老师说过的话互相勉励。
    “好好学习，对得起王老师，给王老师报仇！”已经成为孩子们相互鼓励的口号。
