Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th — The American aggressors perpetrated an unprecedented bloody massacre against our captured personnel detained in the US POW camps on Koje Island this morning. This is the beginning of a premeditated massacre of our captured personnel by the US side. According to the BBC, over 160 of our captured personnel were killed or wounded.

According to US news agencies, prior to the start of the massacre, the American invading army made all preparations for a large-scale massacre, digging trenches around camps 76, 77, and 78, and threatening to launch an offensive against these three camps first. On the 9th, two battalions of US troops, with flamethrowers and tanks, conducted a massacre drill at camp 74, near camp 76. On the evening of the 9th, the American executioner Boatner declared, "All preparations for the big operation are complete."

On the morning of the 10th, the US side, under the pretext of transferring our captured personnel in camp 76, launched an attack on our unarmed captured personnel with more than 1,000 soldiers and three tanks, with another twelve tanks gathered outside the camp. Under the direct command of the executioner Boatner, before attacking the camp, the US military "first threw tear gas and concussion grenades into the camp" (Associated Press), and then "rushed into the camp under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, firing approximately 1,000 flamethrowers, concussion grenades, tear gas grenades, and rifle grenades" (United Press). According to the Associated Press, after entering the camp, the bestial American invading army carried out a cruel massacre of our captured personnel, using bayonets to "stab and hack to death the resisting Communist prisoners," and "throwing concussion grenades into the densely packed prisoner groups," so that "the ground was covered with groaning wounded," and "the battlefield (!) was full of corpses."

According to another Associated Press report, the bloodthirsty American invading army, after massacring our captured personnel in camp 76, was ordered to launch an attack on camp 78 at noon on the 10th.

It is no coincidence that the American aggressors began the massacre of our captured personnel on the third day after the US negotiators refused to attend the meeting in Panmunjom. This is irrefutable evidence that the US side is deliberately sabotaging the armistice negotiations. The American aggressors took camp 76, which had detained Dodd for demanding humane treatment, as the first target for the massacre, which further illustrates that this shocking atrocity by the US side is a savage retaliatory act taken by the US side in a fit of rage after losing face in front of the people of the world due to the Dodd and Colson incidents. Moreover, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 9th, "some" of our captured personnel on Koje Island "are to be moved off the island." This shows that the US side is not only openly carrying out a bloody massacre of our captured personnel, but will also secretly carry out more cruel abuse and persecution. The American aggressors' so brutally carrying out an unprecedented bestial massacre of our unarmed captured personnel nakedly exposes the extreme shamelessness and hypocrisy of the US side's talk of "humanitarianism" and "observance of the Geneva Convention." The cowardly and brutal American aggressors, who openly violate the Geneva Convention, will surely be subjected to just sanctions by the people of the world.

### 美方在巨济岛进行大屠杀  我方被俘人员死伤已达一百六十余人

    美方在巨济岛进行大屠杀
    我方被俘人员死伤已达一百六十余人
    【新华社开城十日电】美国侵略者在十日清晨对被拘留在巨济岛上美方战俘营中的我方被俘人员进行了空前的血腥大屠杀。这是美方对我方被俘人员谋划已久的大屠杀的开始。据英国广播公司透露，我方被俘人员死伤已达一百六十余人。
    据美国通讯社报道，在这次屠杀开始之前，美国侵略军作了一切进行大规模屠杀的准备，在第七十六、七十七、七十八三个营场周围挖掘了壕沟，并扬言要首先对这三个营场发动进攻。九日，美军两营在喷火器和坦克配合下向七十六号营场附近的七十四号营场作了进行屠杀的演习。九日晚上，美国刽子手波纳就宣称：“大行动的一切准备已经就绪。”
    十日清晨，美方藉口要七十六号营场中的我方被俘人员迁移，以一千多名士兵和三辆坦克，对赤手空拳的我方被俘人员发动了进攻，另外还有十二辆坦克聚集在营场外面。在刽子手波纳的直接指挥下，美军在攻入营场之前“先向营场内投掷催泪弹和震荡手榴弹”（美联社），然后在“坦克和装甲车掩护下冲入这个营场，发射了约一千发喷火弹、震荡手榴弹、催泪性手榴弹和枪榴弹”（合众社）。据美联社透露，在攻入营场以后，兽性的美国侵略军向我方被俘人员进行了残忍的屠杀，用刺刀“刺死和劈砍进行抵抗的共军俘虏”，并且“往挤得密密的俘虏群中扔震荡手榴弹”，以致“地上躺满了呻吟的负伤者”，“战场上（！）遍是死尸”。
    另据美联社消息，嗜杀成性的美国侵略军在屠杀了七十六号营场中的我方被俘人员以后，已奉令在十日午间向第七十八号营场发动进攻。
    美国侵略者在美方谈判代表拒绝到板门店开会的第三天开始了对我方被俘人员的大屠杀，不是偶然的。这是美方蓄意破坏停战谈判的不容置辩的证据。美国侵略者拿曾经因要求人道待遇而扣留了杜德的第七十六号营场作为首先进行屠杀的对象，进一步说明美方这种骇人听闻的暴行，是美方因杜德和柯尔生事件而在全世界人民面前丢尽了脸以后，恼羞成怒而采取的野蛮报复行为。不但如此，据美联社巨济岛九日电透露，巨济岛上的我方被俘人员“有一部分要迁出岛外”。这说明美方对我方被俘人员不但正在公开地进行血腥的屠杀，并将秘密地加以更残忍的虐杀与迫害。美国侵略者如此残暴地对赤手空拳的我方被俘人员进行史无前例的兽性大屠杀，这就赤裸裸地暴露了美方嘴里的“人道主义”、“遵守日内瓦公约”的说法的极端无耻和虚伪。公然破坏日内瓦公约的卑怯而残暴的美国侵略者，必将受到全世界人民的正义制裁。
