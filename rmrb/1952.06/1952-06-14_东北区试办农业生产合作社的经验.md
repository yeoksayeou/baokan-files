Experiences in Piloting Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the Northeast Region

Since last winter, various rural areas in Northeast China have piloted a number of agricultural production cooperatives with a focus; various places have gained many achievements and experiences in the pilot program.

After several years of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, mutual aid organizations in most areas of Northeast China have made considerable progress. During the patriotic production increase campaign last year, most mutual aid teams in various places were consolidated and improved. According to statistics from last autumn: the number of farm households included in long-term, fixed-pattern mutual aid teams in the entire Northeast region accounted for about 25 percent of the total number of organized farm households. These farm households, due to long-term mutual aid and long-term collective labor, have deeply understood the superiority of being organized and have developed the habit of collective labor. Some mutual aid teams have also used new agricultural tools or accumulated a portion of public property. In order to further increase production, most of these mutual aid teams have requested to develop into agricultural production cooperatives. This is the foundation for the Northeast to pilot agricultural production cooperatives with a focus now.

Last winter and this spring, Northeast China further raised farmers' awareness by summarizing the experience of mutual aid and cooperation and conducting education on socialist prospects. In this way, various places selected a number of mutual aid teams with better performance and the necessary conditions and reorganized them into agricultural production cooperatives. The purpose is to accumulate experience for the universal development of production cooperatives in the future. The agricultural production cooperatives piloted in the Northeast last winter and this spring can be roughly divided into two categories: The first category is those that have met certain conditions as mentioned above and are reorganized in a planned way under the overall voluntary participation and government leadership. This category accounts for the majority of the existing agricultural production cooperatives. Although these agricultural production cooperatives have not been established for a long time, they have begun to show more advantages than mutual aid teams, and thus have won the support of the farmers. In addition, more than 150 agricultural production cooperatives have been naturally transformed by mutual aid teams as a result of collectively trying out new agricultural tools. This type of agricultural production cooperative has a great influence, and many mutual aid teams take them as the direction of development. The second category is a minority in the existing agricultural production cooperatives, which did not have the conditions to establish agricultural production cooperatives, but were spontaneously organized by a few activists and village cadres; some were even compiled by district and village cadres by coercion and command. Now, according to the instructions of Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Northeast China is persuading cadres and farmers to temporarily change this kind of production cooperative into various types of mutual aid teams.

The advantages of the agricultural production cooperatives that are organized with leadership and conditions are: (1) Due to the unified use of land, labor, and animal power, the planning of production has been greatly strengthened, thus gradually incorporating farmers' individual economy into the orbit of the national planned economy. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have formulated patriotic production increase plans this year, actively participated in the production increase campaign, and become the banner of the production increase competition in various places. For example, the Han En and Jin Shilong agricultural production cooperatives in Jilin Province are the initiators of the national patriotic production increase campaign. Meng Qingyu and Yang Xianting in Heilongjiang Province, Zhang Fuling in Songjiang Province, He Fengshan in Jilin Province, Zhang Wenchun in Liaodong Province, Liu Hongda in Liaoxi Province, and Du Chang and Chen Fenglin in Rehe Province are all initiators of the patriotic production increase campaign in their respective provinces. (2) The result of opening up land boundaries and unified cultivation by these agricultural production cooperatives has provided favorable conditions for the promotion of new agricultural tools. The vast majority of the 500 sets of new agricultural tools promoted by the Northeast People's Government in various places this year were lent to agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives that have not yet received new agricultural tools have also requested the government to lend them new agricultural tools. This shows that with the development of agricultural production cooperatives in the future, the promotion of new agricultural tools will be accelerated. Because agricultural production cooperatives have sufficient strength, they can comprehensively improve farming techniques and increase yield per unit area. This year, the production increase plans of agricultural production cooperatives in various places generally exceed the local production increase requirements by 10 to 20 percent, and a few even exceed them by one to two times. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production, these agricultural production cooperatives are vigorously reforming farming techniques. For example, Han En, Du Chang, and other agricultural production cooperatives have overfulfilled this year's fertilizer application and soil improvement plans. (3) The rational use of labor by agricultural production cooperatives has not only improved labor efficiency, but also further expanded production. Most agricultural production cooperatives have achieved division of labor according to the needs of production and the specialties of the members, and have set up specialized groups for agriculture, sideline occupations, and marketing. (4) The principle of "more work, more gain" encourages the labor enthusiasm of the members. This is the main reason why agricultural production cooperatives in various places can cultivate intensively and produce more grain. This spring, the progress of spring plowing and sowing in agricultural production cooperatives in various places was faster than that of ordinary mutual aid teams due to the unprecedented enthusiasm of the members. The Jin Shilong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanji County, Jilin Province, distributes dividends according to 30 percent for land and 70 percent for labor, and implements scoring and work recording and remuneration according to work. As a result, all the members of the cooperative have extremely high enthusiasm for labor. As a result of their concerted efforts in careful cultivation, the yield of both paddy and dry land last year exceeded that of ordinary mutual aid teams in the local area, even in the case of poor harvests, with the dry land exceeding 3,000 jin per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen mu). (5) In collective labor, many cooperatives have also established collective learning systems, thus continuously increasing the collective consciousness of the members. The contradictions of sequential cultivation that cannot be solved by ordinary mutual aid teams do not exist in agricultural production cooperatives. Many farmers who used to "play tricks" and "be petty" when working in mutual aid teams have changed after participating in agricultural production cooperatives. Generally, farmers who participate in agricultural production cooperatives have a strong desire to move forward. Many agricultural production cooperatives have formulated three-year or five-year production and construction plans at the request of the members, and some have even planned to purchase tractors.

In the pilot agricultural production cooperatives last year and this spring, the following main experiences have been gained:

(1) The period of starting to organize agricultural production cooperatives must be based on the needs of production, the degree of ideological awareness of farmers, the foundation and experience of mutual aid and cooperation, and the conditions of key leaders, and implement the principle of focusing on pilot projects and typical demonstrations in order to gain experience and then promote them. Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces resolutely implemented the above principles. Although the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the two provinces is small, the impact on farmers is widespread and profound. Songjiang Province has piloted 38 agricultural production cooperatives with leadership, with less than 1,000 participating households, but each has achieved good results and has become a model for farmers to emulate. On the contrary, Liaoxi, Liaodong, and other provinces have neglected the above principles and conditions and blindly developed a large number of agricultural production cooperatives, resulting in a very bad impact and causing many illusions among farmers. In order to correct this deviation, Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, has instructed all localities to organize only one or two pilot projects per county this year according to the above principles and conditions. In areas where the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is better in the north, one pilot project can be organized per district; all those organized with leadership and focus are only allowed to be organized well, not badly.

(2) Organizing agricultural production cooperatives, like organizing mutual aid teams, must adhere to the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. Some local district and village cadres forced farmers to organize "cooperatives" and nationalized all farmers' land and other means of production; some production cooperatives evaluated the price of carts and horses too high, making households without carts and horses suffer; some evaluated the price of carts and horses too low, making households with carts and horses suffer. These have aroused dissatisfaction among farmers. And all production cooperatives organized in strict compliance with the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit have been enthusiastically supported by farmers, and the enthusiasm of the members for labor is extremely high.

(3) When agricultural production cooperatives are first established, the degree of centralization should not be too high, and the scope of operation should not be too large. Some counties stipulate that agricultural production cooperatives should concentrate their residence and land, which has increased the difficulties in the pilot program. At present, each cooperative is generally composed of 10 to 20 households or a natural village of the same number of households; the scope of operation is centered on agricultural production and operates several major sideline occupations; vegetable gardens and household sideline occupations are operated by individual members. This can prevent the phenomenon of neglecting one thing while attending to another due to too much involvement and lack of experience.

(4) The land shares, labor dividends, treatment of carts and horses, and the amount of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds of agricultural production cooperatives in various places should be determined separately according to the specific circumstances of each cooperative and should not be forced to be uniform.

(5) Once an agricultural production cooperative is established, it must establish a democratic life and strengthen ideological education for its members. Especially in the process of organization, attention should be paid to educating farmers to overcome selfish ideas and establish a collective consciousness. For example, in the process of transforming from the Han En mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative, a fierce struggle was launched against old ideas, thereby educating all members and enabling the smooth development of the cooperative. On the contrary, some agricultural production cooperatives did not provide enough education to their members, resulting in the phenomenon of members not taking care of public agricultural tools and carts and horses. Now, various places have paid attention to this phenomenon, and many agricultural production cooperatives have established systems for studying politics and culture. In addition, some agricultural production cooperatives have established preliminary financial, accounting, and other systems, which are also necessary for consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives.

### 东北区试办农业生产合作社的经验

    东北区试办农业生产合作社的经验
    东北各地农村从去冬以来有重点地试办了一些农业生产合作社；各地在试办中已获得许多成绩和经验。
    经过了几年来的互助合作运动，东北多数地区的互助组织有长足的发展。去年爱国丰产竞赛运动中，各地大部分互助组都得到了巩固和提高。据去年秋天统计：全东北区长期定型互助组所包括的农户，占已组织起来的农户总数的百分之二十五左右。这些农户由于长期互助，长期集体劳动，已深刻地懂得了组织起来的优越性，养成了集体劳动的习惯。有些互助组还使用了新式农具或积累了一部分公有财产。这些互助组为进一步提高生产，大多要求发展为农业生产合作社。这就是东北能够在现在有重点地试办农业生产合作社的基础。
    去冬和今春，东北各地曾通过总结互助合作经验和进行社会主义远景的教育，进一步提高了农民的觉悟。这样，各地就选择了若干成绩较好、条件具备的互助组，把它们改组成农业生产合作社。目的是为今后普遍发展生产合作社积累经验。去冬和今春东北试办的农业生产合作社，大致可分为两类：第一类是由上述已具备了一定条件，在全体自愿、在政府领导下，有计划地改组的。这一类在现有的农业生产合作社中为多数。这些农业生产合作社成立的时间虽然还不长，但都已开始显示出了比互助组更多的优点，因而得到了农民们的拥护。此外，有一百五十多个农业生产合作社，是由互助组因集体试用新农具的结果，自然转变成的。这种农业生产合作社影响很大，许多互助组都以它们为发展的方向。第二类是现有农业生产合作社中的少数，本不具备成立农业生产合作社的条件，单凭少数积极分子和村干部的热情自发组织起来的；有的甚至是区、村干部强迫命令编起来的。现在，东北各地正根据东北人民政府主席高岗的指示，在说服干部和农民把这种生产合作社暂时改变为各种类型的互助组。
    那些有领导有条件地组织起来的农业生产合作社，已显出的优越性是：（一）由于统一使用土地、人力和畜力，生产计划性大大加强了，从而使农民的个体经济，渐渐纳入了国家计划经济的轨道。绝大多数农业生产合作社，今年都制订了爱国增产计划，踊跃参加了增产竞赛运动，并成为各地增产竞赛的旗帜。如吉林省的韩恩、金时龙两农业生产合作社，是全国爱国增产竞赛运动的发起者。黑龙江省孟庆余、杨显亭，松江省张福龄，吉林省何凤山，辽东省张文春，辽西省刘洪达，热河省杜昌、陈凤林等农业生产合作社，都是各省爱国增产竞赛运动的发起者。（二）这些农业生产合作社打开地界、统一耕作的结果，便为推广新农具提供了有利条件。东北人民政府今年在各地有重点推广的五百套新式农具，绝大多数是贷给农业生产合作社的。尚未得到新农具的农业生产合作社，也纷纷要求政府贷给新农具。这说明今后随着农业生产合作社的发展，将加速新农具的推广工作。农业生产合作社因为力量充实，能够全面改进农作技术，提高单位面积产量。今年各地农业生产合作社的增产计划，一般都超过当地增产要求百分之十到二十，少数甚至超过一倍到两倍。为实现增产目标，这些农业生产合作社都在大力改革农作技术。如韩恩、杜昌等农业生产合作社，都已超额完成了今年的施肥和改良土壤的计划。（三）农业生产合作社合理使用人力，不仅提高了劳动效率，也进一步扩大了生产。多数农业生产合作社都作到了根据生产的需要和社员们的特长实行分工，都设有农业、副业、供销等专业组。（四）多劳多得的原则鼓励了社员们的劳动积极性。这是各地农业生产合作社所以能够精耕细作，多打粮食的主要原因。今春，各地农业生产合作社都因社员劳动热情空前高涨，春耕播种的进度比一般互助组快。吉林省延吉县金时龙农业生产合作社，按土地三成，劳动力七成分红，并实行评分记工，按劳取酬。因而该社全体社员劳动热情极高，一致精心耕作的结果，去年在歉收的情况下，水旱田的产量都超过当地一般互助组，旱田每垧（一垧等于十五市亩）超过三千多斤。（五）在集体劳动中，许多合作社还建立了集体学习制度，因而使社员的集体观念不断增长。一般互助组不能解决的先后耕作等矛盾，在农业生产合作社中都不存在了。许多过去在互助组里劳动时“耍尖头”“闹小心眼”的农民，参加农业生产合作社后，都有了转变。一般参加农业生产合作社的农民，前进心都很强。许多农业生产合作社在社员的要求下，制订了三年或五年的生产建设计划，有的还计划购买拖拉机。
    各地在去年和今春试办农业生产合作社中，已获得了下列主要经验：
    （一）开始组织农业生产合作社的时期，必须根据生产需要、农民的思想觉悟程度、互助合作的基础和经验、骨干领导等条件，并贯彻重点试办、典型示范的方针，以取得经验，再加推广。黑龙江、松江两省坚决贯彻了上述方针，虽然目前该两省农业生产合作社的数目较少，但对农民所发生的影响却很广泛和深刻。松江省有领导地试办了三十八个农业生产合作社，参加的农户尚不到一千户，但个个效果良好，成为农民看齐的榜样。相反，辽西、辽东等省忽视了上述方针和条件，盲目发展起大批农业生产合作社，结果影响很坏，在农民中造成了很多错觉。为纠正这种偏向，东北人民政府主席高岗已指示各地必须根据上述方针和条件，今年每个县只试办一两个，北部互助合作基础比较好的地区，每区可试办一个；凡有领导有重点地组织起来的，都只准办好，不准办坏。
    （二）组织农业生产合作社和组织互助组一样，必须遵守自愿互利的原则。有的地方区、村干部强迫农民组织“合作社”，把农民的土地和其他生产资料一律归公；有些生产合作社把车、马工价评得过高，使无车马户吃亏；有的把车马工价评得过低，使有车马户吃亏。这些都引起农民的不满。而凡严格遵守自愿互利组织起来的生产合作社，都得到农民的热烈拥护，社员劳动情绪极高。
    （三）农业生产合作社初办的时候，集中的程度不宜太高，经营范围不要太大。有的县规定农业生产合作社集中居住、土地集中，结果增加了试办中的困难。目前，一般的每个社都由十户到二十户或由同等户数的一个自然村组成；经营的范围都以农业生产为中心，经营几种主要的副业；菜园和家庭副业等都由社员个人经营。这便可以防止因包揽太多和经验不足，而发生顾此失彼的现象。
    （四）各地农业生产合作社的土地入股、劳动力分红、车马处理和公积金、公益金的数量等，都应根据每个社的具体情况分别确定，不能强求一致。
    （五）农业生产合作社一成立，就必须建立民主生活和加强对社员的思想教育。特别是在组织的过程中，应注意教育农民克服自私自利的思想，树立集体观念。如韩恩互助组在转变为农业生产合作社的过程中，曾对旧思想展开了激烈的斗争，从而教育了全体社员，使合作社得到了顺利发展。相反，有的农业生产合作社对社员教育不够，发生社员对公有农具和车马不加爱护的现象。现在，各地对这个现象已引起注意，许多农业生产合作社都已建立了学习政治和文化的制度。此外，有些农业生产合作社已建立了初步的财务、会计等制度，这也是巩固和发展农业生产合作社所必须的。  （新华社）
