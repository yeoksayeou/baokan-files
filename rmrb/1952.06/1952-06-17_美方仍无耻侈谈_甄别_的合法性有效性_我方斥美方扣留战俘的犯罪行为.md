Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: The US side, in open violation of the Geneva Convention and through illegal so-called "screening," is attempting to detain large numbers of our captured personnel. The heroic resistance of our captured personnel and the confessions of the US POW camp commanders have thoroughly exposed this US trick. However, in the Korean armistice negotiations, the US side still shamelessly talks about the legality of the so-called "screening" and the validity of the so-called "screening" results. At the meeting of the delegations of both sides on the 16th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, sternly pointed out:

    "You even dare to talk about the legality of your so-called 'screening' and the validity of your so-called 'screening' results. I want to ask you, what law does your so-called legality conform to? Didn't the fifteen countries you claim to represent sign the Geneva Convention three years ago? Doesn't the 1949 Geneva Convention clearly stipulate that all prisoners of war must be repatriated after the armistice? Doesn't the Geneva Convention clearly stipulate that prisoners of war must not renounce their right to be repatriated? Isn't this sufficient to prove that your 'screening,' which aims to detain prisoners of war, is completely illegal? Your proposition to 'screen' prisoners of war is completely illegal. Your so-called 'screening' results have no validity whatsoever. Your 'screening' process and results are a gigantic fraud. It is not others who have exposed this gigantic fraud, but you yourselves—your POW camp commander Colson and countless news reports that you cannot block. They have all admitted to your continuous massacres and atrocities. You know in your hearts that this approach of yours is completely illegal, and that the truth of your crimes has been exposed midway. Therefore, in your anger and shame, you do not hesitate to lie to our faces and distort the facts, saying that we once acquiesced to your so-called 'screening,' and attempting to drag us into the water, you propose some kind of 'joint and neutral re-screening' so that you can continue to commit crimes to the end. We have repeatedly told you that we have never and will never agree to your 'screening' or 're-screening,' nor will any truly neutral country or organization be willing to participate in your 'screening' or 're-screening.' Because that is illegal and inhumane, the prisoner of war repatriation issue must be resolved on the basis of the 1949 Geneva Convention. Our May 2nd proposal to guarantee prisoners of war a peaceful life at home fully complies with the 1949 Geneva Convention, and is therefore the only reasonable basis for resolving the issue. Your side must withdraw your April 28th proposal, because it is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention. If you are unwilling to use the 1949 Geneva Convention as the basis for resolving the prisoner of war repatriation issue, negotiations will not make progress."

    美方仍无耻侈谈“甄别”的合法性有效性
    我方斥美方扣留战俘的犯罪行为
    【新华社开城十六日电】美方公开违反日内瓦公约，并非法进行所谓“甄别”，是在企图扣留我方大批被俘人员。我方被俘人员的英勇反抗和对方战俘营长官的招供，已经彻底地揭穿了对方的这一骗局。但对方在朝鲜停战谈判中，却仍然恬不知耻地侈谈所谓“甄别”的合法性，和所谓“甄别”结果的有效性。我方首席代表南日将军，在十六日的双方代表团大会上严词指出：
    “你们竟然敢说你们所谓‘甄别’的合法性和你们所谓‘甄别’结果的有效性。我要问你们所谓合法性究竟合的是什么法？难道你们自称所代表的十五个国家，没有在三年以前在日内瓦公约上签字吗？难道一九四九年的日内瓦公约，没有明文规定停战后要遣返全部战俘吗？难道日内瓦公约没有明文规定战俘不得放弃被遣返的权利吗？难道这还不充分证明你们旨在扣留战俘的‘甄别’是彻底非法的吗？你们‘甄别’战俘的主张是彻底非法的。你们的所谓‘甄别’结果没有任何有效性。你们的‘甄别’过程和结果是一个天大的骗局。揭穿这个天大的骗局的不是旁人，正是你们自己——你们的战俘营长官柯尔生和你们无法封锁的无数新闻报道。他们都承认了你们不断进行的屠杀暴行。你们心里知道你们这种做法是彻底非法的，而且中途被暴露了犯罪的真相，所以你们在恼羞成怒之余，就不惜当面撒谎，歪曲事实，说是我们曾经默认过你们的所谓‘甄别’，并企图用拖人下水的办法，提议一个什么‘共同与中立的再甄别’，以便你们犯罪犯到底。我们已经一再告诉过你们：我们从来没有也永远不会同意你们的‘甄别’或‘再甄别’，也不会有任何真正的中立国家或机构愿意参与你们的‘甄别’或‘再甄别’。因为那是非法的、非人道的，战俘遣返问题必须在一九四九年日内瓦公约的基础上，求得解决。我方保证战俘回家过和平生活的五月二日方案，完全符合一九四九年的日内瓦公约，因此是解决问题唯一合理的基础。你方必须撤回你方四月二十八日的方案，因为那是彻底违反日内瓦公约的。如果你们一天不愿意以一九四九年的日内瓦公约作为解决战俘遣返问题的基础，谈判就一天不会有进展。”
