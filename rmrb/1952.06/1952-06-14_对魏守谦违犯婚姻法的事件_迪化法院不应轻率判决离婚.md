To the Editor: I am reporting my husband, Wei Shouqian's, illegal behavior to the Party newspaper. Taking advantage of a work transfer, he used despicable means to force me to divorce him, disregarding the interests of our children.

In March 1950, Wei Shouqian brought me to Beijing. Initially, our relationship was good. In the second year, after I became pregnant, he fell in love with another female comrade.

Last year, the organization transferred Wei Shouqian to work in a minority area in Xinjiang. Because I was near my delivery date, I could not go with him. Wei Shouqian took this opportunity to transfer that female comrade to Xinjiang with him. However, he deceived me by saying that I could go to Xinjiang after I gave birth. But on the fifth day after I gave birth, Wei Shouqian sent me a letter proposing a divorce. He sent two more letters afterwards, continuing to demand a divorce, but he did not mention the children at all. I was extremely angry and want to expose Wei Shouqian's illegal behavior. The Marriage Law stipulates: "During the wife's pregnancy, the husband may not file for divorce; if the husband requests a divorce, he may do so only one year after the wife's delivery." However, Wei Shouqian filed for divorce five days after I gave birth. The Dihua Municipal People's Court in Xinjiang made a judgment without investigation and research, listening only to Wei Shouqian's one-sided story, which is inappropriate. Now I request the Dihua Municipal People's Court to re-examine this issue.

    对魏守谦违犯婚姻法的事件
    迪化法院不应轻率判决离婚
    编辑同志：我向党报揭发我的丈夫魏守谦的违法行为。他乘调动工作的机会，采用下流手段，强迫我和他离婚，并且置子女利益于不顾。
    一九五○年三月，魏守谦接我到北京来。起初我们的感情还好。第二年我怀了孕，他就爱上了另外一个女同志。
    去年组织上调魏守谦去新疆少数民族地区工作，我因已近产期，不能同去。魏守谦乘此机会调那个女同志一起去新疆。但是他欺骗我说，等我生了小孩，就可以去新疆。可是，在我生产后的第五天，魏守谦就来信向我提出离婚，以后他又来了两封信，继续要求离婚，但对孩子的问题却只字不提。我气极了，我要揭发魏守谦这种违法行为。婚姻法上规定：“女方怀孕期间，男方不得提出离婚；男方要求离婚，须于女方分娩一年后，始得提出。”可是魏守谦却在我分娩后五天就提出离婚。新疆迪化市人民法院竟不调查研究，听信魏守谦一面之辞，就作了判决，这是不妥当的。现在我要求迪化市人民法院重新处理这个问题。
