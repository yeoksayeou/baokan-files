Editor's Note: In mid-May, the Hebei Provincial People's Government convened a commissioner's meeting, fully assessing the new factors of the widespread surge in patriotic production enthusiasm among farmers, and called on farmers to universally launch a patriotic production increase campaign. The meeting proposed the policy of "universally improving unit area yield and focusing on cultivating high-yield models." Currently, the leadership of production in some areas lags behind the demands of the masses, and the patriotic production increase movement has fallen into a state of laissez-faire; some areas focus on the leadership of high-yield models, neglecting the leadership of the universal production increase movement in the vast rural areas; some areas emphasize "busy work, unable to spare the strength to lead the competition." This report of the Hebei Provincial People's Government is of considerable help in solving these ideological and practical problems. All localities can refer to the practices and experiences of Hebei Province, seize the busy summer season, and universally launch the patriotic production increase campaign.

In mid-April, Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Li Ziguang, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Kerang, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, led more than 50 cadres from various provincial departments to inspect spring plowing and sowing work in various special districts, and found that a new atmosphere was emerging in the vast rural areas. However, some leadership organs above the county level did not see these new positive factors, or did not pay attention to them. Some counties were only satisfied with the cultivation of high-yield models, and did not pay enough attention to universal production increase. Many counties did not pay enough attention to the cooperative mutual aid movement. In short, the leadership of production could not keep up with the demands of the masses, and the high-yield movement fell into a state of laissez-faire.

In order to consolidate achievements, correct shortcomings, catch up quickly, and concentrate efforts to carry out a comprehensive patriotic production increase campaign, the Hebei Provincial People's Government and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee issued a "Decision and Instructions on Organizing a Vigorous Patriotic Agricultural Production Increase Campaign," and convened a commissioner's meeting in mid-May in order to unify thinking and clarify the direction and requirements of the production increase competition. In order to learn from experience, the meeting organized six counties, divided into mountain and plain groups, to launch a competition, and held a signing ceremony for the competition at the meeting.

**It is necessary to fully recognize the production enthusiasm of the masses**

The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has inspired the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the broad masses of farmers; their work enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have generally surged. These new factors are the ideological foundation for comprehensively carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign.

Many labor models, advanced farmers, and farmers in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives have extremely high enthusiasm for production increase. High-yield cotton fields in various counties of Handan Special District generally require a yield of about 250 jin of cotton per mu; dozens of mutual aid groups require creating a high-yield record of 1,000 jin of cotton per mu. As of the end of May, incomplete statistics from only five special districts in the province showed that 3,432 villages, 188 agricultural production cooperatives, 16,024 mutual aid groups, and 48,495 individual farmers had participated in the competition. This spring, under the ideological guidance of drought prevention and resistance, localities have achieved remarkable results in harrowing to preserve soil moisture and building water conservancy projects. The number of harrowing times generally reached four to five, more than double the previous years, and some harrowed six to nine times. As of mid-May, the province had dug 74,452 brick and stone wells, exceeding the original plan (59,605 wells) by 25 percent. Many areas raised their own brick and material to dig wells without or with little use of loans, greatly demonstrating the potential and creativity of the masses. The leadership in various localities has attached importance to this year's mutual aid and cooperation movement, and has designated full-time cadres to lead it. The counties have successively convened one to two meetings of mutual aid representatives. The labor force organized during the spring plowing this year has increased from 40 percent last year to 56 percent. However, the leadership at all levels has underestimated the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, lagging behind the masses. For example, this year's well-digging plan was increased at each level from top to bottom; some counties required loans when accepting well-digging tasks, while some masses dug many wells without loans. Now the masses universally require the leadership to help improve mutual aid groups, help improve technology, and provide a large supply of fertilizers and new agricultural tools, but the leadership feels that there is no way to do it and the supply is insufficient. These situations have hindered the timely and universal launch of the patriotic production increase movement. Therefore, it is necessary to improve work style, go deep among the masses, learn from the masses, improve leadership effectiveness, and cherish and promote the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses.

**Guiding principles for the patriotic production increase campaign**

Last year, the Hebei Provincial Labor Model Conference proposed carrying out a model high-yield movement in thousands of villages and tens of thousands of groups, but did not emphasize overall production increase enough; later, it commended and rewarded a few typical high-yield new records, and local areas generated a one-sided view on the issue of carrying out the patriotic high-yield competition. Many cadres understood "Patriotic High-Yield Competition" as the creation of new records by a few advanced farmers and mutual aid groups, while neglecting the central requirement of "universally improving unit area yield." Therefore, in this spring's competition, various localities made plans to cultivate high-yield counties, districts, villages, groups, and households, but generally did not have specific and effective methods for how to achieve overall production increase. This commissioner's meeting focused on studying this issue, and clearly called for "carrying out the patriotic production increase competition," specifically requiring "universally improving unit area yield and focusing on cultivating high-yield models." Advanced individuals and mutual aid groups should take the lead in creating high-yield new records, universally mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of farmers to enthusiastically participate in the patriotic production increase campaign.

**The significance of carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign**

We believe that the significance of comprehensively carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign has the following aspects:

First, through the production increase competition, fully exploit the potential of agricultural production in the vast rural areas. In areas where the competition is well-carried out, the masses are very enthusiastic, and all work is easy to complete. For example, after Jin County launched a production increase competition, Zhoujiazhuang, with 470 households, bought 116,945 jin of soybean cakes in three days; some farmers sold their unused belongings to buy fertilizers and pesticides; the county people's bank exchanged 3,836 silver dollars in seven days. As long as the potential of the broad masses of farmers is unleashed, the level of agricultural production can be greatly improved. This year, Hebei Province originally required a yield of 145 jin of grain per mu and 35 jin of ginned cotton per mu; if the production increase competition can be comprehensively carried out and there are no irresistible disasters, it is estimated that the yield may be 154 jin of grain per mu and 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

Second, through the competition, leadership ability can be improved, work style can be improved, and all work can be driven forward in big strides. Tong County's Sixth District launched a patriotic production increase red flag competition, mobilized the masses, and the leadership ability of district cadres improved, overcoming the phenomenon of busyness and chaos. After Jin County launched a production increase competition, militia work, women's work, and the purchase of cotton and sale of fertilizer became active. Some cadres who were not united also united in unanimously promoting the production increase competition; the work style of not being active and being detached from the masses has also been greatly changed. After the masses are mobilized, their enthusiasm is increased, and the coercive command style of cadres can also be overcome.

**Ideological education and organization are the guarantee of production increase**

Strengthening ideological education and vigorously promoting the organization of farmers are the central links to achieving patriotic high-yield. Judging from the materials from various localities, the mainstream of farmers' thinking at present is the demand for developing production, but due to the influence of the long-term individual economy, the enthusiasm for developing the individual economy still accounts for a considerable proportion; some farmers do not have a clear understanding of the direction of organization and cannot see the socialist future, and there is still agricultural socialist thought; some farmers only know that resisting the United States and aiding Korea is patriotism, and lack a clear understanding of the consistency of national interests and personal interests; the conservative thinking of production reaching the top also still exists in large quantities; some farmers are afraid of competition, afraid of not being able to compare with others, and losing face. If these ideas are not vigorously overcome, it will be difficult to carry out a comprehensive patriotic production increase campaign. Therefore, it is necessary to first do a good job of ideological mobilization of the masses. The content of ideological education mainly includes patriotism and the direction and future of organization. It is necessary to educate farmers to care about national interests, obey national plans, and further overcome farmers' selfish and self-interested ideas of relying on national loans and taking advantage of the state; at the same time, use local examples of high-yield from living people and real events to break farmers' conservative thinking.

Organization is the main guarantee of production increase. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei Province, 56 percent of the labor force has already been organized, which is still far from the central government's requirement of organizing 70 to 80 percent of the labor force this year. In the future, it is necessary to resolutely implement the central government's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, so that the mutual aid and cooperation movement can advance healthily and in big strides. On the one hand, use organization to guarantee the realization of patriotic production increase; on the other hand, in the patriotic production increase campaign, greatly develop and improve various mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

**Mobilize comprehensively from top to bottom, organize competition from bottom to top**

The specific guiding method for the patriotic production increase campaign should adopt a combination of comprehensive mobilization from top to bottom and organization of competition from bottom to top, universally mobilize, focus on grasping key points, seize typical demonstrations, and promote the general. It is necessary to discover and correct errors in the implementation of policies below in a timely manner, but should not be afraid of making mistakes and act timidly. We should constantly encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses, stimulate their creativity, and overcome negative factors with positive measures.

The production increase competition is based on mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, with Party members, League members, labor models, and activists as the backbone, leading all farmers to participate. It is necessary to mobilize farmers to universally formulate production increase or high-yield plans. Each county should have a general plan from bottom to top. The patriotic high-yield plans that have already been formulated in various localities should be reviewed and revised, and those that have not been formulated should be formulated in a practical manner. The formulation of plans must be based on facts, and different requirements should be put forward according to different regions and different conditions, preventing them from being too high or too low. We should establish more banners that can be accepted and learned by the local masses, and not just look to the highest peak in the country. Some of the high-yield plans in various localities now are too high, and there is no certainty of achieving them, and they make the masses feel out of reach and dare not respond to the challenge; some are formulated too low, and can be achieved without effort, losing the meaning of competition. Both of these deviations should be corrected. In addition, in the process of formulating plans, it is necessary to educate the broad masses of cadres and farmers to clearly establish the idea of long-term construction, and do a good job of long-term construction plans in accordance with local conditions, overcoming the view of temporary tasks.

Organizing agricultural patriotic production increase competition should focus on villages, groups, and households, and organizing competition between counties is also an important method for leading overall production increase. At the same time, competition between counties can also encourage the work enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres, enabling them to cooperate closely and go all out. To date, Daming and Raoyang, Jianping and Laishui, Miyun, Qianxi, Xingtai and Shahe, Nangong and Weixian, Shenxian and Jixian, Hejian and Suning, Gaocheng and Zhengding, Zhaoxian, Dingxian and Anguo have launched patriotic production increase competition between counties. The provincial leadership organs have decided to directly participate in guiding the two groups of competitions in the plain area of Daming and Raoyang, and the mountain area of Jianping and Laishui, Miyun, Qianxi. Some counties are still brewing to participate in these two groups of competitions.

In the competition, it is necessary to vigorously carry out publicity work, use all publicity forces and tools, at different seasons, according to the different ideological situations and competition progress of the masses, with different content, repeatedly publicize, and constantly improve the political and ideological level and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural cadres and masses. Handan Special District organized cadres from various counties to visit Daming County and learn from the experience of Daming County's mutual aid and cooperation work, which can be adopted by various localities.

**The work of all departments should closely cooperate**

In the patriotic production increase campaign, all kinds of work should keep up, especially economic departments, such as supply and marketing, trade, banks, transportation, etc., must closely cooperate. Means of production, such as fertilizers, waterwheels, agricultural tools, pesticides, etc., should be comprehensively arranged and supplied in a timely manner. At the commissioner's meeting, we unified the thinking of cadres, and from now until the autumn harvest, the patriotic production increase competition is the overriding central task in rural areas. Department work should serve the central task; and through the central task, drive the department work forward. There are already many facts showing that the agricultural patriotic production increase campaign has been launched in that area, and the work of purchasing cotton and promoting fertilizer sales has also been done better. At the same time, the two major patriotic production increase campaigns of agriculture and industry should also unify their steps and advance side by side. The agricultural sector should provide a large amount of commodity grain and industrial raw materials needed by industry; the industrial sector should manufacture new agricultural tools, waterwheels, pesticides, and fertilizers to supply the needs of agriculture. In order to overcome the mechanical "single-handed" work style, governments at all levels in Hebei Province have established or are establishing evaluation and inspection committees at all levels headed by the administrative responsible cadres at all levels.

**Strengthen technical guidance work**

In order to strengthen technical guidance in the patriotic production increase campaign, we have designated June as the technical transmission month. Technical transmission teams composed of farms at all levels, cotton production guidance areas, and senior students from agricultural colleges and senior agricultural schools will go to various places to impart agricultural technology. It is estimated that the province can directly train 300,000 people and indirectly train more than 3 million people.

After the commissioner's meeting, various localities, through people's representative conferences at all levels or enlarged meetings of district and village cadres, universally implemented the spirit of carrying out the patriotic production increase competition to the villages at the end of May, and carried out a series of organizational work in a concrete manner. The universal patriotic production increase campaign in the whole province will be universally and enthusiastically launched from points to areas in early and mid-June.

    河北省人民政府关于开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动的报告
    编者按：河北省人民政府在五月中旬召开了专员会议，充分估计了广大农民爱国增产积极性普遍高涨的新因素，号召农民普遍开展爱国增产竞赛运动。会议提出了“普遍提高单位面积产量和重点培养丰产典型”的方针。目前，有些地区对生产的领导落后于群众要求，爱国增产运动陷于自流状态；有些地区着重对丰产典型的领导，忽视了对广大农村的普遍增产运动的领导；有些地区强调“工作忙，抽不出力量领导竞赛”。河北省人民政府的这个报告，对于解决这些思想问题和实际问题都有相当帮助。各地都可参考河北省的作法和经验，抓紧夏忙季节，把爱国增产竞赛运动普遍地开展起来。
    四月中旬，河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰、中共河北省委秘书长李子光、省人民政府农林厅副厅长张克让，带领省级各部门干部五十多人，分别到各专区检查春耕播种工作，发现广大农村呈现着一片新气象。但有些县以上的领导机关，对于这些新的积极因素没有看到，或没有予以注意。有的县只满足于对丰产典型的培养，对普遍的增产注意不够。许多县对合作互助运动重视不足。总之，生产领导赶不上群众要求，丰产运动陷于自流的现象非常严重。
    为了巩固成绩，改正缺点，急起直追，集中力量开展全面爱国增产竞赛运动，河北省人民政府及中共河北省委发出了“组织起来开展轰轰烈烈的农业爱国增产竞赛运动”的决定和指示，并于五月中旬召开了专员会议，以便统一思想，明确增产竞赛的方针和要求。为了吸取经验，会议组织了六个县，分成山区、平原两组，展开竞赛，并在会议上举行了竞赛签字仪式。
    要充分认识群众的生产积极性
    “三反”“五反”运动的胜利，鼓舞了广大干部和广大农民群众的积极性；他们的工作热情和生产热情普遍高涨。这些新的因素，是全面开展爱国增产竞赛运动的思想基础。
    很多劳动模范、先进农民和互助组、农业生产合作社的农民，增产热情极高。邯郸专区各县丰产棉田，一般要求每亩产棉二百五十斤左右；有几十个互助组，要求创造每亩千斤棉花高额丰产纪录。截至五月底，全省只五个专区不完全的统计，已有三千四百三十二个村，一百八十八个农业生产合作社，一万六千零二十四个互助组，四万八千四百九十五户单干户的农民，参加了竞赛。今年春天在防旱抗旱的思想指导下，各地耙地保墒、兴修水利，成绩显著。耙地次数一般达到四至五遍，超过往年一倍，多的耙到六至九遍。截止五月中旬，全省已打砖、石井七万四千四百五十二眼，超过原计划（五万九千六百零五眼）百分之二十五。有不少地区不用或少用贷款，自筹砖料打井，大大发挥了群众的潜在力和创造性。对今年的互助合作运动，各地领导方面已重视起来，并都确定专职干部领导。各县都先后召开了互助代表会议一至二次。今年春耕期间组织起来的劳力，已由去年百分之四十增加到百分之五十六。但各级领导方面对干部及群众的积极性估计不足，落在了群众的后面。如今年的打井计划，由上到下，逐级都有增加；有的县接受打井任务，就要求贷款，而有的群众不用贷款就打成了很多井。现在群众普遍要求领导方面帮助提高互助组，要求帮助改进技术，要求大量供应肥料、新式农具，而领导方面却感到没有办法，供应不及。这些情况已经障碍了爱国增产运动的及时普遍开展。因此必须改进作风，深入群众，向群众学习，提高领导效能，爱护和发扬干部和群众的积极性。
    爱国增产竞赛运动的指导方针
    去年河北省劳动模范会议提出了开展千村万组模范丰产运动，而对全面增产强调不够；以后又表扬和奖励了少数丰产新纪录典型，各地在开展爱国丰产竞赛问题上，产生了片面观点。很多干部把“爱国丰产竞赛”理解为由少数先进农民、互助组创造新纪录，而忽视了“普遍提高单位面积产量”的中心要求。因此，在今年春天的竞赛当中，各地都作了培养丰产县、区、村、组、户的计划，而对于如何实现全面增产，一般都没有具体切实的办法。这次专员会议，着重地研究了这一问题，明确号召“开展爱国增产竞赛运动”，具体要求“普遍地提高单位面积产量，有重点地培养丰产典型”。由先进人物、互助组带头，创造高额丰产新纪录，普遍发动和组织广大农民群众，踊跃参加爱国增产竞赛运动。
    开展爱国增产竞赛运动的意义
    全面开展爱国增产竞赛运动的意义，我们认为有以下几方面：
    首先，通过增产竞赛运动，充分发挥广大农村生产的潜在能力。竞赛开展较好的地区，群众热情很高，什么工作都好完成。如晋县展开了增产竞赛运动，四百七十户的周家庄，三天买进十一万六千九百四十五斤豆饼；有些农民变卖了用不着的财物，购买肥料和农药；县人民银行七天内收兑三千八百三十六块银元。只要广大农民群众的潜力发挥出来，农业生产水平就可以大大提高。今年河北省原要求每亩产粮食一百四十五斤，产皮棉三十五斤；如能全面开展增产竞赛，并且没有不可抗拒的灾害，估计每亩可能产粮食一百五十四斤，产皮棉四十斤。
    其次，通过竞赛，可以提高领导能力，改进工作作风，带动一切工作大步前进。通县六区开展了爱国增产红旗竞赛，发动了群众，区干部领导能力提高了，克服了忙乱现象。晋县在开展增产竞赛以后，民兵工作、妇女工作，以及购棉售肥等工作，都活跃起来。有些干部不团结，也在一致地推动增产竞赛运动中团结了；工作不积极和脱离群众的作风，也得到很大的转变。群众发动起来以后，提高了积极性，干部的强迫命令作风也可以得到克服。
    思想教育和组织起来是增产的保证
    加强思想教育，大力推动农民组织起来，是实现爱国丰产的中心环节。从各地材料来看，目前农民思想的主流是要求发展生产，但由于长期的个体经济的影响，发展个体经济的积极性，仍占相当大的比重；有些农民对组织起来的方向认识不明确，看不清社会主义前途，还有农业社会主义思想；有些农民只知道抗美援朝是爱国，而对国家利益和个人利益的一致性，缺乏明确的认识；生产到顶的保守思想也还大量存在；有些农民怕竞赛，怕比不过别人，自己丢人。如不大力克服这些思想，全面的爱国增产竞赛运动的开展就很困难。因此，必须首先做好对群众的思想发动工作。思想教育的内容，主要是爱国主义以及组织起来的方向和前途。要教育农民关心国家利益，服从国家计划，进一步克服农民依赖国家贷款和占国家便宜的自私自利思想；同时用当地活人活事的丰产事例，打破农民的保守思想。
    组织起来是增产的主要保证。据河北省现在不完全的统计，百分之五十六的劳力已经组织起来，这离中央提出的今年百分之七十到八十的劳力组织起来的要求相差尚远。今后要坚决贯彻中央互助合作运动的方针，使互助合作运动健康地大步前进。一方面以组织起来保证爱国增产的实现；一方面在爱国增产竞赛运动中，大量地发展和提高各种互助合作组织。
    自上而下全面发动，自下而上组织竞赛
    爱国增产竞赛运动的具体指导方法，应采取自上而下地全面发动和自下而上地组织竞赛相结合的方法，普遍地发动，有重点地掌握，抓紧典型示范，以推动一般。要及时发现及时纠正下边执行政策上的错误，但不应怕出错误而小手小脚不敢行动。应该不断地鼓舞广大群众的积极性，激发他们的创造性，以积极办法去克服消极因素。
    增产竞赛以互助组、农业生产合作社为基础，以党员、团员、劳动模范、积极分子为骨干，带动全体农民参加。要发动农民普遍地订立增产或丰产计划。各县要有自下而上的总计划。各地已订立的爱国丰产计划应再审查修订，没有订立的要切实订立。订计划必须实事求是，按不同地区，不同条件，提出不同的要求，防止过高或过低。应多树立当地群众能接受并能学习的旗帜，不要光向全国最高峰看齐。现在各地的丰产计划，有些是过高的，能否实现没有把握，并且使群众感到望尘莫及，不敢应战；也有的订的过低，不努力也能达到，失掉了竞赛意义。这两种偏向都应当纠正。此外，在订计划当中，要教育广大干部和农民明确树立长期建设的思想，要因地制宜做好长期建设计划，克服临时任务观点。
    组织农业爱国增产竞赛，要以村、组、户为主，而组织县与县间的竞赛，也是领导全面增产的重要办法。同时，县和县之间的竞赛，也可以鼓舞广大干部的工作积极性，使广大干部能够密切配合，全力以赴。到目前为止，全省已有大名和饶阳，建屏和涞水、密云、迁西，邢台和沙河，南宫和威县，深县和冀县，河间和肃宁，藁城和正定、赵县，定县和安国展开县和县之间的爱国增产竞赛。省级领导机关决定直接参加指导平原区的大名和饶阳，山区的建屏和涞水、密云、迁西的两组竞赛。有些县还正在酝酿参加这两组的竞赛。
    在竞赛中，要大张旗鼓地开展宣传工作，利用一切宣传力量和工具，在不同季节，根据群众的不同思想情况和竞赛进度，以不同内容，反复地宣传，不断地提高广大农村干部和群众的政治思想水平和生产积极性。邯郸专区组织各县干部到大名县参观并学习大名县的互助合作工作的经验，各地都可以采用。
    各部门的工作都要紧密配合
    在爱国增产竞赛运动中，各种工作都应当跟上去，特别是经济部门，如供销、贸易、银行、交通运输等，都必须紧密配合。生产资料，如肥料、水车、农具、农药等，要全面安排，及时供应。在专员会议上，我们统一了干部思想，从现在到秋收，以爱国增产竞赛为农村的压倒一切的中心工作。部门工作要为中心工作服务；并通过中心工作，带动部门工作前进。现在已有很多事实说明，那个地区的农业爱国增产竞赛运动开展起来了，购棉、推销肥料工作也就做得较好。同时，农业和工业的两大爱国增产竞赛运动也应统一步调，齐头并进。农业方面要大量地供给工业需要的商品粮食和工业原料；工业方面要制造新式农具、水车、农药、肥田粉，供应农业的需要。为了克服机械的“单打一”的作风，河北省各级政府，已建立或正在建立以各级行政负责干部为首的各级评比检查委员会。
    加强技术指导工作
    为了加强爱国增产竞赛运动中的技术指导工作，我们已定六月份为技术传授月。由各级农场、棉产指导区及农学院、高级农校的高年级学生，组成技术传授队，到各地传授农业技术。预计全省共可直接训练三十万人，间接训练三百万人以上。
    专员会议后，各地都通过各界人民代表会议或区、村干部扩大会议，在五月底普遍把开展爱国增产竞赛的精神贯彻到村，具体地进行了一系列的组织工作。全省范围内的普遍的爱国增产竞赛运动，即将在六月上、中旬由点到面普遍热烈展开。
