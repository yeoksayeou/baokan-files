    (This dispatch from our Shanghai office, dated June 14th) In order to gradually cultivate a large number of technical talents from the working class, to serve as the backbone in future large-scale economic construction, Shanghai, under the guidance of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the East China Military and Administrative Committee, has decided to establish two workers' secondary technical schools this summer, accommodating more than 3,000 people. At the same time, some existing secondary technical schools will be expanded to accommodate more than 2,000 people, specifically enrolling qualified young industrial workers, revolutionary cadres, and the children of industrial workers and revolutionary cadres. These schools will be divided into classes according to the needs of economic construction, the students' educational levels, and work experience, with an expected graduation time of two and a half to four years.

    Shanghai began preparations a month ago, establishing the Preparatory Committee for Shanghai Workers' Secondary Technical Schools, with Liu Changsheng, Third Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, serving as the Chairman, and Gu Mu, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, serving as the Vice Chairman. Responsible cadres from relevant agencies and organizations such as the East China Industrial Department, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Education Bureau are participating. The main tasks of the preparatory work are to resolve the specific staffing and departments of the schools, allocate administrative cadres and teachers, mobilize and recruit students, and determine school buildings, teaching equipment, and curriculum and teaching materials. The schools will be divided into light industry and heavy industry, and then further divided into departments according to the needs of industrial construction. The principals and main responsible cadres have been appointed by the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. General administrative cadres will be transferred from relevant departments; ordinary cultural teachers will be allocated by the East China education departments; and technical teachers will be allocated by relevant business departments.

    Currently, the Enrollment Committee, mainly organized by the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, is preparing to mobilize and recruit students in a planned and focused manner from industrial workers in the hardware, textile, and municipal industries. After review and examination, they will be admitted to the schools. School buildings have been allocated, and necessary construction and equipment are being resolved through self-construction, allocation, borrowing, or purchase, following the principles of thrift and simplicity. Curriculum and teaching materials are also being planned and researched, and it is planned to concentrate the transferred administrative cadres and teachers for prior study, so that they can clearly understand the guiding principles and tasks, correct their work attitudes, and focus on studying curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, and other issues. The technical schools are scheduled to open in late September or early October.

    从工人中培养技术人材参加经济建设工作
    上海市筹办工人中等技术学校
    定今年秋季开学将招收五千多青年产业工人和革命干部
    【本报上海十四日专电】为了从工人阶级中逐步培养大批技术人材，作为今后大规模经济建设工作中的骨干，上海市在中共中央华东局和华东军政委员会指示下，决定在今年暑期创办工人中等技术学校两所，容纳三千多人；同时扩充部分原有中等技术学校，容纳二千多人，专门招收适合条件的青年产业工人，革命干部，以及产业工人和革命干部的子弟入学。这些学校将按经济建设需要、学员文化水平与工作经历等不同情况，分别编班，预定二年半至四年毕业。
    上海市在一个月前即开始进行筹备工作，成立了上海工人中等技术学校筹备委员会，由中共上海市委员会第三书记、上海总工会主席刘长胜任主任委员，市委宣传部部长谷牧任副主任委员，华东工业部、华东纺织管理局、上海总工会及上海市人民政府教育局等有关机关团体，都派有负责干部参加。筹备工作的主要内容是解决学校的具体编制和分科，调配行政干部与教师，动员与招收学生，确定校舍与各项教学设备及课程与教材等问题。学校将分轻工业与重工业两种，再按工业建设需要分科。校长及主要负责干部已由中共中央华东局和中共上海市委员会分别抽调得力干部充任；一般行政干部由各有关部门调配；普通文化课教师由华东教育部门负责调配；技术科教师由有关业务部门负责调配。
    目前，正以上海总工会为主体组织招生委员会，准备有计划有重点地在五金、纺织、市政等产业工人中进行动员，招收学生，再经过审查考试后入学。校舍现已调配好，必要的建筑和设备也在节约朴素的原则下，采取自建、调配、借用或购置等办法解决。课程教材也在计划研究中，并准备将调来的行政干部与教师先行集中学习，使他们明确认识方针任务，端正工作态度，有重点地研究课程、教材、教法等问题。技术学校已预定九月下旬或十月初开学。
