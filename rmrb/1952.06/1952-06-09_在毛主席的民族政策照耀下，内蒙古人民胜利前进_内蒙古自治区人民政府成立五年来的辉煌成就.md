The Inner Mongolian people have been practicing national regional autonomy for five years. Five years ago, on May 1, 1947, when the Chinese People's Liberation War was still in a tense and arduous stage, and the people in many places were still living under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the Inner Mongolian people had already been liberated, and the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was born. The working people of Inner Mongolia began to completely control their own destiny, using their hard work to create their own prosperous life. In five years, the people of Inner Mongolia have experienced earth-shaking changes.

    The State of Agricultural Production is Changing

    More than 80 percent of Inner Mongolia's 2.4 million people are engaged in agricultural production. Due to the implementation of land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the backward state of agricultural production is rapidly changing. Before the land reform, due to long-term oppression by internal and external reactionary forces, most peasants had no intention of improving production; they did not cultivate, did not hoe, did not fertilize, nor did they select seeds, but simply scattered the seeds and waited for harvest. After the land reform, under the vigorous leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, since 1948, farmers have launched bumper harvest campaigns every year, practicing intensive cultivation and meticulous farming. Now, the area of fertilizer application in the entire region has reached 32 percent of the cultivated land area. The peasants of Chahasen Nuotu (district) in the Horqin Right Banner Rear increased the amount of manure they applied in 1949 by 18 times compared to 1948. Old manure piles that had accumulated like mountains for more than 30 years were all sent to the fields. Seed selection and seed disinfection have been carried out in most areas. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has cultivated improved varieties in 16 seed collection gardens and three farms for farmers to use. More than 60,000 agricultural production mutual aid teams have emerged throughout Inner Mongolia. This year, some groups have expanded and reorganized into agricultural production cooperatives with land and labor as shares. Thirty percent of the cultivated land in the region is cultivated three times and hoed three times; the area of extensive cultivation with one cultivation and one hoeing is decreasing year by year. In addition, more than 5,000 improved farm tools have been promoted successively. Among them are not only improved farm tools such as hoeing machines, but also new-style horse-drawn mechanical farm tools. The Nawen Farm even used tractors and harvesters. Therefore, the yield per unit area has increased. Before the land reform, the average yield per hectare in Hulunbuir League was 1,200 catties, but now it has been increased to 1,600 to 1,700 catties. The total grain output in the region has exceeded the pre-liberation level.

    Before the land reform, the folk artist Mao Yihan in Inner Mongolia sang like this:

    "The Great Northern Wilderness, the spring breeze is cool,
    Wear a tattered sheepskin to open up the wasteland.
    The hoe eats the flesh on the hands,
    For the sake of a grain in autumn.
    The hot weather, the sun is poisonous,
    Steaming below and roasting above to weed.
    Sweat is like raindrops,
    Let it flow, sweat or tears.
    When autumn comes, the grain is ripe,
    The rent collector rides a horse to the field,
    The blood-sucking whip howls,
    It's hard to keep the grain even if your head is broken.
    The landlord's house is piled high with grain,
    We are as hungry as skinny monkeys.
    The rich lords eat fragrant and sweet food,
    In our bowls, water is mixed with soil."

    Today, in the same "Great Northern Wilderness," the farmers' situation is completely different. In the Fafu Village gacha (agricultural district administrative village) of Horqin Right Banner Front, 280 households (that is, 80 percent) were poor and hired peasants in the past. After the land reform, after several years of large-scale production campaigns, 95 percent of the households have risen to the level of middle peasants. Before the land reform, the entire gacha had only 130 horses. By last year, this had increased to 280, and 244 new cattle were purchased. Sheep have increased from 108 to more than 800 now. Rubber-tired carts and iron carts have increased from 50 to 156. A farmer named Li Yuting said that his family used to have only "four-legged furry mice," but now there is a fat and strong horse and two mules tied in the livestock pen, and 40 white big sheep in the sheepfold. During the New Year, the family ate two big pigs weighing more than 200 catties. Eighty new houses and 120 warehouses for storing grain were built in the entire gacha. Due to the increase in houses, a new street has been added to Fafu Village. According to a survey of four leagues in the eastern region in 1950, each farmer, in addition to having enough food and clothing, had a surplus of grain that could be exchanged for about 20 to 70 feet of cloth.

    Beautiful and Abundant Grasslands

    Animal husbandry is an important production for the Inner Mongolian people. More than half of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's area of more than 600,000 square kilometers is pastoral area. This includes the nationally renowned Hulunbuir and Xilingol two major natural pastures. The entire pasture is like a green sea. The wind blows the tender grass, like the rippling blue waves of the ocean. In this green sea, yurts are like undulating islands, with hundreds and thousands of cattle and sheep surrounding them, leisurely grazing. One can imagine how beautiful this vast and flat grassland of Inner Mongolia is! The Hulunbuir grassland is rich in water and grass, and the livestock are strong and fat. Especially the cattle, which have always been famous throughout the country. The horses produced in the East Ujimqin of Xilingol League are sturdy and strong, suitable for riding, pulling carts, and plowing the land. However, before liberation, the pastures of Inner Mongolia suffered from the cruel devastation of reactionary rulers, and livestock were plundered in large quantities, decreasing year by year. Twenty years ago, the New Barag Right Banner had more than 600,000 head of livestock, but by the eve of liberation, only 160,000 head remained. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, feudal privileges were abolished in the pastoral areas, and the policy of increasing and protecting livestock was implemented. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the policy of "prohibiting wasteland reclamation and protecting pastures" was resolutely implemented; and a series of measures were taken, such as epidemic prevention, wolf hunting, well digging, hay storage, fire prevention, shed construction, and feed regulation. In order to improve livestock breeds, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region allocated 3 billion Mongolian currency in 1950 to herdsmen to purchase breeding livestock. Last year, the Central People's Government allocated another 2 billion yuan in pastoral loans for the vast herdsmen of Inner Mongolia to accelerate the development of animal husbandry. In this way, the herdsmen's enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved, and the breeding rate of livestock has generally and rapidly increased. In 1951, the average livestock breeding rate in the pastoral areas reached 85.69 percent, and the survival rate reached over 90 percent. In the four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League, the average livestock survival rate reached 95 percent; some areas even reached 99.97 percent. The livestock survival rate of San Dubu, a model pastoral worker in Xilingol League, reached 100 percent. This is unprecedented in history. In 1951, the net increase rate of livestock in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia increased by 19.05 percent compared with 1950, and nearly half compared with 1947. Compared with 1945, the existing livestock have increased by one to three times in some areas. The New Barag Right Banner now has an average of 83 head of livestock per person. The four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League have an average of 52 and a half head of livestock per person. The lives of the vast herdsmen have improved unprecedentedly. In 1951, the total value of cattle, sheep, horses, and fur sold in the four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League was more than 58 times the total value of sales in 1949. Everywhere on the vast grasslands, there is a thriving scene. At present, pastoral areas are focusing on promoting grass cutting machines, building waterwheel wells, and preparing to focus on sowing pasture grass, gradually turning herdsmen into permanent residents, and further developing animal husbandry production.

    The People's Government's Trade Policy Brings Happiness to the People of Inner Mongolia

    Before liberation, the vast farmers and herdsmen of Inner Mongolia suffered from the horrifying high-interest exploitation of unscrupulous merchants: a cow could only be exchanged for a cigarette holder, a sheep could only be exchanged for two pieces of brick tea, and a sheepskin could only be exchanged for three taels of wine. The losses suffered by farmers and herdsmen as a result are incalculable. As soon as the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established, it began to organize state-owned trading organizations, cooperatives, and transportation undertakings. Now, state-owned trade has grown to account for more than half of the total trade in the region. In 1951, although Inner Mongolia suffered a severe drought, the total sales of state-owned trade within the region still expanded by 78 percent compared with 1950, supplying 22,000 tons of grain to the disaster areas, lending 5,000 tons of seeds to farmers, and opening up sales channels for slow-moving local specialties such as medicinal materials, natural alkali, and mirabilite. Last year, at the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition, goods worth 12.5 billion yuan were sold. These trades helped disaster victims solve their living difficulties. The cooperative cause is also developing rapidly under the leadership of the national economy. After focusing on establishing cooperatives in 1948, the number of members reached 270,000 in 1949, increased to 600,000 in 1950, and further increased to nearly 800,000 in 1951, accounting for one-third of the region's population. The number of cooperative members in East Sunite Banner reached more than 80 percent of the banner's total population. Funds increased by 17.66 percent in 1950 compared with 1949, and increased by another 67 percent in 1951 compared with 1950. In order to vigorously develop cooperatives, the People's Government of Xilingol League directly appointed the banner chiefs of each banner as the directors of the cooperatives last year.

    Trading through cooperatives has greatly reduced the intermediate exploitation of private merchants, and the era of merchants' massive high-interest exploitation of herdsmen is over. In 1949 alone, the intermediate exploitation of 100,000 sheep was reduced in the grasslands. The trade policy of the People's Government has narrowed the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural (pastoral) products, increased the actual income of farmers and herdsmen, and improved the purchasing power of farmers and herdsmen. In agricultural areas, one ton of sorghum could only be exchanged for 36 feet of cloth in 1947, but this increased to 226.8 feet in 1950, and further increased to 359.5 feet in the first half of last year. In pastoral areas, a medium-sized horse could be exchanged for 171 feet of twill cloth in 1949, but this year it can be exchanged for more than 900 feet. At the Naadam conference in Hulunbuir League the year before last (the Naadam conference is an annual gathering of masses in pastoral areas, during which trade and cultural entertainment activities are carried out), most of the cloth bought by herdsmen was coarse cloth. Last year, they wanted high-quality and beautiful silk and satin. During the five-day conference, the trade department of Hulunbuir League sold more than 6,000 bolts of silk and satin. The millet and glutinous millet that were popular at the conference the year before last were mostly replaced by white flour last year. A total of 2,500 bags of white flour were sold the year before last, and 4,600 bags were sold last year, which still did not meet the needs of the herdsmen. A herdsman named Tebden bought 10 bags of white flour, six pieces of silk robe fabric, 200 catties each of glutinous millet and millet, five pieces of brick tea, and 20 catties of white wine at one time, for a total of 4.8 million yuan. The total transaction amount for the five-day conference reached 4.3588 billion yuan. The increase in herdsmen's purchasing power is simply amazing.

    Development of National Culture and Education

    Along with the rise of economic life, the cultural and educational undertakings of Inner Mongolia have also made great progress. Before liberation, under the dark rule of internal and external reactionaries, the people of Inner Mongolia did not have the opportunity to receive education. The illiteracy rate in the entire region was over 90 percent. Now, schools are opening their doors to the children of workers, peasants, and herdsmen, and more than 80 percent of the children of the working people have entered schools. In 1947, there were only 843 primary schools, but in 1951, this had increased to 3,774. More than 300,000 children are enrolled. In 1947, there were only nine secondary schools, but now this has increased to twelve. In addition, workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools, technical schools, and normal colleges have also been established. Nearly 10,000 workers have participated in regular spare-time cultural school studies. Last year, more than 300,000 farmers and herdsmen participated in winter studies. More than one-quarter of the region's population, including children, youth, workers, peasants, herdsmen, women, etc., are receiving education of varying degrees. In order to solve the difficulty of enrollment for the children of herdsmen, government-funded students have been specially set up. The state also provides subsidies for the enrollment of children of herdsmen in some pastoral areas. More than 2,000 students in Xilingol and Chahar Leagues have received this treatment. For other ethnic minorities in the autonomous region, such as the Oroqen, the People's Government has specially established schools for them. Of the Oroqen people, numbering only more than 800 (referring to those living within the borders of Inner Mongolia), 99 percent were illiterate, but now there are 78 students studying. All expenses for schools and students are provided by the People's Government. The People's Government of Xilingol League also helped lamas establish cultural schools to learn national culture.

    The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also pays attention to the development of national languages and scripts. Primary school textbooks are stipulated to be written in the language of the ethnic group, and only in the higher grades is Chinese taught for a certain amount of time according to the actual situation. Some textbooks in junior high schools are also taught in Mongolian. Important official documents are also written in both Mongolian and Chinese. In the past five years, 69 textbooks have been translated into Mongolian, with 1.249 million copies published. A total of 225 kinds of Chairman Mao's works and popular science, production knowledge, and popular reading materials translated into Mongolian have been published, with more than 440,000 copies. Mongolian newspapers have been published, radio stations have been established, and art troupes have been established. The cultural life of the people of Inner Mongolia has been greatly improved.

    Driving Away Diseases and Increasing Population

    The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region attaches great importance to the people's health undertakings. Chairman Ulanhu once put forward the policy of "prosperity of both people and livestock," calling on the people to strive to increase the population of the Inner Mongolian nation. In the past, under the oppression of internal and external reactionary forces, the health of the people of Inner Mongolia was extremely poor. Widespread syphilis caused the population of the Mongolian nation to decline year by year. The population chart of Solon Banner turned into a shape that was large in the middle and pointed at both ends, that is, there were many middle-aged people and few elderly and young people. Until the early days of liberation, more than 60 percent of the people in pastoral areas suffered from syphilis. In 1950, the Health Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region established a syphilis prevention and treatment station in Hulunbuir League and began large-scale "syphilis eradication" work. By 1951, all syphilis patients in the four pastoral banners of Hulunbuir League had been treated. At the same time, the treatment work began to advance to Xilingol League. A total of 34,813 people were examined, and 14,068 people were treated. According to the follow-up statistics after treatment in Chen Barag Banner of Hulunbuir League, 72.6 percent were cured and 12.6 percent showed improvement. The initial victory in treating syphilis has stopped the downward trend of the population in some areas and has begun to rise. In Chen Barag Banner, 201 people were born in 1950 and 151 people died, an increase of 50 people; while in the early days of liberation, only 50 people were born in that year, and 109 people died. What a clear contrast! From January to May of last year, the banner added another 96 babies. Many mothers who longed for children in the past are now holding chubby babies. In order to quickly eradicate syphilis, the Hulunbuir League Syphilis Prevention and Treatment Station has been expanded into a venereal disease prevention and treatment center this year. At present, universal re-treatment and follow-up surveys have begun.

    In agricultural areas, due to the vigorous promotion of new midwifery methods and the transformation of old midwives, the infant mortality rate has decreased in some areas. The infant mortality rate in Tuquan County, Xing'an League, has dropped from 37.1 percent to 3.2 percent. Inner Mongolia is beginning to "prosper."

    Great Unity of All Ethnic Groups

    Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy not only brought new life and happiness to the people of Inner Mongolia, but also united the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia unprecedentedly, fundamentally eliminating past ethnic oppression and discrimination, and establishing a new ethnic relationship of equality, friendship, unity, and mutual assistance.

    Shangdu Xianghuang United Banner in Chahar League's pastoral area suffered a drought last year, and the grass did not grow well. The banner government negotiated with the neighboring agricultural area of Huade County, asking the farmers of Huade County to agree to let the herdsmen of Shangdu Xianghuang United Banner graze their livestock. Due to past oppression by Han chauvinism, the herdsmen were initially skeptical. However, as soon as they arrived in Huade County, they were warmly welcomed by the local farmers. The farmers of Huade County had already vacated houses and prepared furniture, as well as livestock pens, warm sheds, and firewood, to warmly entertain them. The herdsmen felt as if they were in their own homes. Sometimes the herdsmen's cattle ran away, and the local farmers immediately braved the heavy wind and snow to help them find the cattle. The farmers of Chenjiagou Village, fearing that the herdsmen's dairy cows would freeze, kept the dairy cows in their own warm sheds and fed them grass together. These facts moved the Mongolian people. They also treated the Han people with the same affection: helping the Han people dig wells and accumulate fertilizer. A Mongolian woman named Si Linma also made two embroidered cigarette pouches and a pair of pillowcases for the Han villagers in Zhang Erlin Village. On the eve of their departure, she embroidered a pair of pillows for the women's representative Han Yumei overnight. In such a harmonious, united, and friendly atmosphere, they lived together for five or six months. When they separated this spring, the Han farmers said, "By autumn, we will have all kinds of grains here. We will have whatever you want to eat. Then you can drive your cattle and sheep here again!" The Mongolian people said, "In the summer, our grasslands will be green. There will be herds of cattle and sheep and lots of milk food. Come! Come and taste our milk food!"

    Such things are numerous. When Wang Zaitian, deputy commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, gave a report to the lamas at the Lama's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Representative Conference last year, he used his own personal experience to explain the changes in ethnic relations. He said, "In the past, we did not dare to admit that we were Mongolians in Han areas. Once we admitted it, we would be followed by the heartbreaking title of 'Old Mongolian'; today, no matter where you are, as soon as you mention that you are a Mongolian, you will be warmly welcomed. Why is this?" Comrade Wang Zaitian asked three "whys" in a row, and finally said:

    "This is because of Mao Zedong! Because of Mao Zedong!"

    The People of Inner Mongolia Love the Motherland and the Volunteers

    The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia love their leader Chairman Mao; they also love their great motherland. When American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea and occupied our territory of Taiwan, the people of Inner Mongolia, like all the fraternal ethnic groups in the country, immediately plunged into the vigorous movement of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea. In towns, villages, grasslands, and forest areas, patriotic and internationalist enthusiasm was rising everywhere. Lamas also enthusiastically supported the Chinese People's Volunteers. Taking the donation of weapons as an example, although Inner Mongolia suffered a severe drought last year, they still showed unprecedented patriotic enthusiasm: workers in factories and forest areas implemented a week of donating labor; farmers donated their own fat pigs, tobacco, and grain. They said, "Let our volunteers and their guns and cannons eat better, so they can beat more American devils." A farmer named Haishan in the Fourth District and Tenth Village of Horqin Left Banner Middle had a family of six. He himself donated a large castrated bull, his wife donated a pig, his eldest daughter donated a sheep, excluding the child who was still breastfeeding in her arms, and the two little girls each donated 30,000 yuan. Haishan said, "Everyone has a share in loving the country, and everyone should fight the American robbers." Herdsmen donated herds of horses, cattle, sheep, and furs. Last year, the 3,000 herdsmen who participated in the Naadam conference in the Eastern United Banner donated nearly 4,000 head of livestock, 15,941 silver yuan, 50 silver ingots weighing 50 taels each, as well as gold, dried meat, etc. Many women donated their gold and silver jewelry that they had been reluctant to use for many years. Bagshi Living Buddha of Haraga Temple in the Eastern United Banner donated 8,000 silver dollars at one time. The entire Inner Mongolia region donated a total of 42.8 billion yuan, which could purchase 26 fighter planes and four artillery pieces, exceeding the original donation plan of 14 airplanes and three artillery pieces by 85.5 percent. In addition, they donated more than 30,000 catties of dried meat and meat floss.

    Last year, when the Sixth Sub-Delegation of the Comfort Mission to Korea went to various parts of Inner Mongolia to deliver reports, the people of Kulun Banner were extremely excited when they heard that these people had returned from the Chinese Volunteers in Korea. Those who lived far away hastened to finish their work and set off a week before the comfort mission arrived at the location of the report. Some carried dry food, harnessed horse-drawn carts, and the whole family, including wives and children, went out. In Kulun Banner, where transportation was very inconvenient and the total population was only more than 80,000, more than 30,000 people actually rushed to listen to the report. The farthest came from 180 miles away. In Halahei, Horqin Right Banner Front, a village with only more than 200 households miraculously gathered more than 10,000 people that day to listen to the report. As far as ten miles away, as soon as people saw the yellow dust raised by the comfort mission's car, they shouted "Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!" Many people were moved to tears by the heroic deeds of the volunteers' arduous combat. Wang En, a 60-year-old farmer in Horqin Right Banner Rear, said, "Even if I lose my old life, I will support the volunteers to the end." A few days ago, the Volunteer Returning Representatives and the Chinese Visiting Delegation of the Korean People came to Inner Mongolia to give reports, which made the people on the grasslands even more excited. They competed to present hadas, fox skins, milk food, and ivory chopsticks to the volunteer representatives and the Korean people's representatives. In the First Zu and Second Baga (pastoral area administrative village) of the Central United Banner, an old woman named Dejide, who was already 65 years old, tightly hugged Xie Xiumei, a first-class female meritorious volunteer, and kissed her repeatedly, bursting into tears. While crying, she recounted her past suffering and her hatred for the American devils. She said, "I never thought that I would be fortunate enough to see you at the age of 65. You are the good children of our Chairman Mao." She specially cooked dumplings for the representatives to eat, and fed them to Xie Xiumei's mouth one by one. The three volunteer representatives and one Korean people's representative were all moved to tears by this simple and sincere old woman.

    在毛主席的民族政策照耀下，内蒙古人民胜利前进
    ——内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五年来的辉煌成就
    白植品
    内蒙古人民实行民族区域自治已经五年了。五年前，一九四七年五月一日，当中国人民解放战争还处在紧张、艰苦的阶段，许多地方的人民还在蒋介石匪帮的黑暗统治下生活的时候，内蒙古人民就已经获得了解放，内蒙古自治区人民政府诞生了。内蒙古的劳动人民，开始把命运完全掌握在自己的手里，用自己的辛勤劳动来创造自己的富裕生活。五年的时间，内蒙古人民经历了翻天覆地的变化。
    农业生产的状况正在改变
    内蒙古的二百四十万人口中，百分之八十以上从事农业生产。由于实行了土地改革，农民的生产积极性空前提高，农业生产的落后状态正在迅速改变着。土地改革前，由于长期遭受内外反动势力的压迫，农民大都无心改进生产，不耕地，不铲趟，不施肥，也不选种，只是撒上种籽，等待收获。土地改革后，在内蒙古自治区人民政府大力领导下，自一九四八年起，农民年年开展丰产运动，实行精耕细作，现在全区施肥面积已达到耕地面积的百分之三十二。科右后旗察哈尔森努图克（区）的农民，一九四九年上的粪比一九四八年增加了十八倍。三十多年来堆积如山的老粪堆，都送到了地里。大部分地区进行了选种和种籽消毒。内蒙古自治区人民政府以十六个采种圃和三个农场培育优良品种，供给农民使用。内蒙全区出现了六万多个农业生产互助组。今年，有的组已扩大改组为土地、劳力入股的农业生产合作社。全区百分之三十的耕地作到三铲三趟；一铲一趟的粗耕面积逐年减少。此外，先后推行了五千多台改良农具。其中不只有铲趟机之类的改良农具，而且有新式的马拉机械农具。纳文农场更使用了拖拉机和收割机。因此，单位面积产量提高了。呼纳盟土地改革前每垧地平均产量是一千二百斤，现在已经提高到一千六百斤至一千七百斤。全区粮食产量已超过了解放前的水平。
    土地改革以前，内蒙古的民间艺人毛亦罕这样唱着：
    “北大荒，春风凉，
    披上破羊皮去开荒。
    镐头吃了手上的肉，
    为的是秋后一颗粮。
    老热天，太阳毒，
    下蒸上晒把草锄。
    汗水好像暴雨点，
    是汗是泪任它流。
    到秋天，粮食熟，
    催租的骑马上地头，
    吃血的鞭子呜呜叫，
    磕破脑袋粮难留。
    地主家粮食堆成山，
    咱们饿得像瘦猴。
    阔老爷吃香又吃甜，
    咱们的碗里水拌土。”
    今天，同样是在“北大荒”，农民的景况却完全两样了。科右前旗发福屯嘎查（农业区行政村）三百五十户中，从前有二百八十户（即百分之八十）人家是贫雇农。土地改革后，经过几年来的大生产运动，有百分之九十五的人家上升为中农。土地改革前全嘎查仅有一百三十匹马，到去年已增加到二百八十匹，又新买了二百四十四头牛。羊由一百零八只增加到现在的八百多只。胶轮车及铁车已由五十台增到一百五十六台。有个名叫李玉廷的农民说，他家从前只有“四条腿带毛的耗子”，现在牲口圈里拴着一匹肥壮的大马、两头骡子，羊圈里还有四十只洁白的大绵羊。过年时，一家人吃了两口二百多斤的肥猪。全嘎查盖了八十间新房，一百二十间贮放粮食的仓库。由于房屋增多，发福屯新添了一道街。据一九五○年东部区四个盟的调查，每个农民除丰衣足食之外，剩余约可交换二十尺至七十尺布的粮食。
    美丽富足的大草原
    牧业生产，是内蒙古民族的一种重要生产。内蒙古自治区面积六十多万平方公里，有一半以上是牧业区。其中包括全国闻名的呼伦贝尔和锡林郭勒两大天然牧场。整个牧场像一片绿的海。风吹嫩草，就像汪洋的碧波荡漾。在这绿色的海里，蒙古包像起伏的海岛，成百成千的牛羊围绕在它的四周悠闲地吃草。人们可以设想，内蒙古这个辽阔而平坦的大草原是多么美丽呵！呼伦贝尔草原水草丰美，牲畜既壮且肥。特别是牛，一向闻名全国。锡林郭勒盟乌珠穆沁所产的马，骠悍健壮，乘骑、拉车、耕地都很适宜。但是在解放前，内蒙古的牧场遭受着反动统治者的残酷蹂躏，牲畜大量被掠夺，一年年在减少。新巴尔虎右翼旗二十年前有六十多万头牲畜，到解放前夕只剩下十六万头。内蒙古自治区人民政府成立后，在牧业区废除了封建特权，贯彻了增畜保畜的方针。在半农半牧区，坚决执行了“禁止开荒，保护牧场”的政策；并采取了防疫、打狼、打井、打草储草、防火、修盖棚圈、调剂饲料等一系列的措施。为了改良牲畜品种，内蒙古自治区人民政府在一九五○年拨出了三十亿元蒙币给牧民购买种畜。去年，中央人民政府又拨发了二十亿元牧业贷款，作为内蒙古广大牧民加速发展畜牧业之用。这样，牧民的生产情绪大大提高，牲畜的繁殖率普遍而迅速地上升。一九五一年牧业区牲畜繁殖率平均达到百分之八十五点六九，成活率达到百分之九十以上。呼纳盟的四个牧业旗，牲畜成活率平均达到百分之九十五；个别地区有达到百分之九十九点九七的。锡林郭勒盟牧业劳动模范散都布的牲畜成活率达到了百分之百。这是历史上没有过的事。一九五一年内蒙古牧业区牲畜的纯增率，比一九五○年增加了百分之十九点零五，比一九四七年增加将近一半。现有的牲畜如和一九四五年比较，有的地区已增加了一倍至三倍。新巴尔虎右翼旗现在每人平均拥有八十三头牲口。呼纳盟四个牧业旗，每人平均有大小牲畜五十二头半。广大牧民的生活空前提高。一九五一年，呼纳盟四个牧业旗的牛、羊、马及皮毛出售总值，达一九四九年出售总值的五十八倍多，辽阔的草原上，到处呈现着欣欣向荣的气象。目前，牧业区正在重点推广打草机，建立水车井，并准备重点播种牧草，逐渐使牧民转为定居，进一步发展牧业生产。
    人民政府的贸易政策给内蒙古人民带来了幸福
    解放前，内蒙古广大农、牧民受着奸商的骇人听闻的高利盘剥：一头牛只换一个香烟嘴，一只羊只换二块砖茶，一张羊皮只换三两酒。农、牧民因此遭受的损失是无法估计的。内蒙古自治区人民政府刚一成立，就着手组织国营贸易机构、合作社及运输事业。现在，国营贸易，已经壮大到占全区贸易总额的一半以上了。一九五一年，内蒙古虽然遭到严重旱灾，但国营贸易在本区内的推销总额仍较一九五○年扩大了百分之七十八，供应灾区粮食达二万二千吨，贷给农民种籽五千吨，并为滞销土特产如药材、天然碱、芒硝等打开销路。去年在华北城乡物资交流展览会上，就推销了一百二十五亿元的货物。这些贸易，帮助灾民解决了生活困难。合作社事业也在国家经济领导下突飞猛进。一九四八年重点成立合作社后，一九四九年社员即达到二十七万人，一九五○年增到六十万，一九五一年更增到近八十万人，占全区人口的三分之一。东苏尼特旗合作社社员达到全旗人口总数的百分之八十以上。资金，一九五○年较一九四九年增加百分之十七点六六，一九五一年较一九五○年又增加了百分之六十七。为了大力发展合作社，锡林郭勒盟人民政府去年直接委派各旗旗长担任合作社的主任。
    通过合作社进行交易，大大减少了私商的中间剥削，商人对牧民大量的高利盘剥时代已经过去了。一九四九年，仅在草地里就减少了十万只羊的中间剥削。人民政府的贸易政策，缩小了工农（牧）产品的剪刀差，使农牧民的实际收入增加，提高了农牧民的购买能力。农业区一九四七年一吨高粱只能换三十六尺布，一九五○年提高到二百二十六尺八寸，去年上半年更提高到三百五十九尺五寸。牧业区一匹中等马，一九四九年换一百七十一尺斜纹布，今年可换到九百多尺。前年呼纳盟那达慕大会（那达慕大会是游牧区群众一年一度的联欢集会，在大会期间进行交易和文化娱乐活动）上，牧民买的布大多是粗布。去年，他们要的是质好色美的绸缎。五天大会期间，呼纳盟的贸易部门共卖出六千多匹绸缎。前年大会上畅销的小米、稷子米，去年多为白面代替了。前年白面共卖了二千五百袋，去年卖了四千六百袋，还没有满足牧民的需要。有个名叫特布登的牧民，一次就买了十袋白面，六件绸缎袍料子，稷子米、小米各二百斤，砖茶五块，白酒二十斤，共用四百八十万元。五天的大会，交易总额达四十三亿五千八百多万元。牧民的购买能力的提高简直是惊人的。
    民族文化教育事业的发展
    伴随着经济生活的上升，内蒙古的文化教育事业也有了极大的发展。解放前，在内外反动派的黑暗统治下，内蒙古人民是得不到受教育的机会的。全区文盲占总人口的百分之九十以上。现在，学校为工人、农民、牧民的子弟开门，百分之八十以上的劳动人民的子弟进了学校。一九四七年小学只有八百四十三所，一九五一年已增到三千七百七十四所。入学儿童达三十多万。中等学校，一九四七年仅有九所，现在增至十二所。另外还创办了工农速成中学、技术学校和师范专科学校。近万工人参加了正规的业余文化学校学习。入冬学学习的农民和牧民，去年达三十多万。全区四分之一以上的人口，包括儿童、青年、工人、农民、牧民、妇女等，在受着不同程度的教育。为了解决牧民子弟入学的困难，特别设置了公费生。部分牧业区牧民子弟入学，国家还发给津贴。锡林郭勒和察哈尔两盟，有两千多学生受到了这种待遇。自治区内的其他少数民族，如鄂伦春族，人民政府特地为他们设立了学校。为数仅八百多人的鄂伦春民族（指居住在内蒙古境内的），原来百分之九十九是文盲，现在已有七十八名学生在学习。学校及学生的全部开支，都由人民政府供给。锡林郭勒盟人民政府还帮助喇嘛成立了文化学校，让他们学习民族文化。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府同时注意发展民族的语言文字。小学的课本，都规定用本民族的文字，仅在高年级才根据实际情况酌授一定时间的汉文。初中也有部分教材规定用蒙文教学。重要公文也都用蒙汉文两种文字。五年来，翻译成蒙文的教科书已有六十九种，出版了一百二十四万九千册。用蒙文翻译的毛主席的著作和科学常识、生产知识、通俗读物共二百二十五种，四十四万多册。出版了蒙文报纸，建立了广播电台，成立了文艺工作团。内蒙古人民的文化生活已大大提高。驱除疾病，人口增加
    内蒙古自治区人民政府对于人民的卫生事业，给予极大的重视。乌兰夫主席曾提出“人畜两旺”的政策，号召人民为增加内蒙古民族的人口而奋斗。过去，内蒙古人民在内外反动势力的压迫下，健康状况极坏。普遍的梅毒病，促使蒙古民族的人口逐年下降。索伦旗的人口图表，变成了中间大、两头尖的形状，即中年人多，老年、少年少。直到解放初期，牧业区人民还有百分之六十以上患有梅毒。一九五○年，内蒙古自治区人民政府卫生部在呼纳盟设立了梅毒防治站，开始大规模的“驱梅”工作。到一九五一年止，已把呼纳盟四个牧业旗的梅毒患者普治一遍。同时开始把治疗工作向锡林郭勒盟推进。一共检查了三万四千八百十三人，治疗了一万四千零六十八人。据呼纳盟陈巴尔虎旗疗后复查统计，痊愈的占百分之七十二点六，有好转的占百分之十二点六。医治梅毒的初步胜利，使部分地区的人口停止了下降的趋势，并开始上升。陈巴尔虎旗一九五○年生二百零一人，死一百五十一人，增加了五十人；而在刚解放时，当年只出生五十人，就死去一百零九人。这是何等鲜明的对照！该旗去年一月至五月，又增加了九十六个婴儿。过去很多渴望子女的母亲，现在都抱上了胖娃娃。为了迅速根除梅毒，呼纳盟梅毒防治站今年扩大为性病防治所。目前已开始举行普遍的复治和疗后调查。
    在农业区，由于大力推行新接生法，改造旧产婆，若干地区的婴儿死亡率降低了。兴安盟突泉县的婴儿死亡率，已由百分之三十七点一降低到百分之三点二。内蒙古开始“人旺”了。兄弟民族大团结
    毛主席的伟大民族政策不但给内蒙古人民带来新生和幸福，而且使内蒙古各族人民空前团结起来，根本消除了过去民族间的压迫和歧视，建立起平等、友爱、团结、互助的新的民族关系。
    察哈尔盟牧业区商都厢黄联合旗去年遭受旱灾，草没有长好。旗政府向邻近农业区化德县交涉，请化德县农民答应商都厢黄联合旗的牧民来放牧。牧民因过去受大汉族主义的压迫，最初还有些怀疑。但是，他们刚一到化德县，就受到当地农民的热烈欢迎。化德县农民早就腾出房子，并准备了家具以及畜圈、暖棚和烧柴，热情地招待他们。牧民们就像到了自己的家里一样。有时牧民的牛跑掉了，当地农民立刻冒着大风雪帮助他们把牛找回来。陈家沟村的农民怕牧民的乳牛冻坏了，就把乳牛圈在自己的暖棚里一块喂草。这些事实，感动了蒙民。他们也以同样的情谊对待汉民：帮助汉民打井，积肥。蒙民妇女斯林玛在张二林村还给汉族老乡做了两个绣花的烟袋和一对枕头套。在回去的前夕，又连夜给妇女代表韩玉梅绣了一对枕头。在这样融洽无间、团结友爱的气氛里，他们共同生活了五、六个月。今年春天他们分别时，汉族农民说：“到秋天，我们这里的五谷都有了，想吃什么都有。那时候你们再赶着牛羊来吧！”蒙民说：“夏天，我们的草原绿了。牛羊成群奶食多，你们来吧！来尝尝我们的奶食吧！”
    这样的事情是很多很多的。内蒙古军区副司令员王再天去年在喇嘛抗美援朝代表会议上向喇嘛做报告时，以他自己的亲身体验，说明民族关系的改变。他说：“从前我们不敢在汉人地区承认自己是蒙古人。一承认，跟着来的就是令人心酸的‘老蒙古’的称呼；今天，不论你在什么地方，一提是蒙古人，就会受到热情的招待。这是为什么呢？”王再天同志连续问了三个“为什么”，最后说道：
    “这是因为有了毛泽东！因为有了毛泽东！”
    内蒙古人民热爱祖国，热爱志愿军
    内蒙古各族人民热爱自己的领袖毛主席；同样热爱自己伟大的祖国。当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争并侵占我国领土台湾时，内蒙古人民跟全国各兄弟民族一样，立即卷入了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动。在城镇、农村、草地、林区，到处都高涨着爱国主义和国际主义的热情。喇嘛也热烈地支援中国人民志愿军。以捐献武器为例：内蒙古去年虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，可是他们仍然表现了空前未有的爱国热情：工厂和林区工人，实行星期献工；农民捐献出自己的肥猪、烟草和粮食。他们这样说：“让我们的志愿军和他们的枪炮吃得好些，好多打几个美国鬼子。”科左中旗四区十村有个名叫海山的农民，全家六口人。他自己捐献一头大犍牛，他的老婆捐一口猪，他的大姑娘捐一只羊，抱在怀里还吃奶的孩子除外，两个小姑娘，每人也各捐了三万元。海山说：“爱国人人有份，美国强盗人人要打。”牧民则献出成群的马、牛、羊和皮货。东部联合旗去年参加那达慕大会的三千牧民，就捐了近四千头牲畜，一万五千九百四十一块银元，五十个五十两重的银元宝，以及黄金、肉干等。许多妇女把自己多年来舍不得用的金银首饰都捐献出来了。东部联合旗哈拉嘎庙巴格希活佛一次就献出八千块银洋。内蒙古全区，共捐献了四百二十八亿元，可以购买二十六架战斗机、四门大炮，超过原捐献计划十四架飞机、三门大炮的百分之八十五点五。此外还捐献了肉干、肉松三万多斤。
    去年，赴朝慰问团第六分团到内蒙古各地作传达报告时，库伦旗人民一听说这些人是从朝鲜志愿军那里归来的，都兴奋得不得了。路远的加紧干完活，在赴朝慰问团到达的前一个礼拜就动身赶赴作报告的地点。有的背着干粮，套上马车，老婆孩子全家出动。在交通十分不便，一共只有八万多人口的库伦旗，居然有三万多群众赶来听传达报告。最远的来自一百八十里路以外。在科右前旗哈拉黑，一个仅住着二百多户的村庄，也奇迹似地，当天就集聚了上万人听传达报告。远在十里路以外，人们刚一看见慰问团的汽车扬起来的黄沙，就高呼“中国人民志愿军万岁！”许多群众都被志愿军艰苦作战的英勇事迹感动得流泪。科右后旗年已六十的农民王恩说：“那怕拚掉老命，也要支援志愿军到底。”前些日子，志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民访华代表来内蒙古作报告，更使草原上的人民沸腾起来。他们争先向志愿军代表和朝鲜人民代表献哈达，献狐皮、奶食以及象牙筷子等。在中部联合旗第一佐第二巴嘎（牧业区行政村），一位年已六十五岁的老大娘德吉德，紧紧地把志愿军一等女功臣解秀梅抱住，不停地吻着吻着，竟大哭起来。她一面哭一面诉说自己过去的苦难和对美国鬼子的仇恨。她说：“我没有想到活了六十五岁，还有福气看到你们一眼。你们是咱毛主席的好儿女。”她特地煮饺子给代表们吃，并且一口一口地喂到解秀梅的嘴里。三位志愿军代表和一位朝鲜人民代表，都被这个纯朴而诚挚的老大娘感动得掉下眼泪。
