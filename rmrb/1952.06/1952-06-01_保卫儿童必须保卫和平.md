    To Defend Children, We Must Defend Peace
    Kang Keqing, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the International Conference for the Defence of Children
    The entire delegation, honored to be entrusted by the Chinese people, attended the International Conference for the Defence of Children in Vienna in mid-April and returned to our nation's capital, Beijing, on May 21st. Let us report to you on the situation and achievements of this conference.
    The 540 delegates attending this conference represented millions of men and women from 64 countries, with different races, languages, religions, and political beliefs, living under different social systems around the world. Yet they all shared one common point: a love for their children. As the war-mongers, headed by US imperialism, have already plunged a part of the world's people into war and are organizing and preparing for an even larger-scale war, children in different corners of the world are threatened. They realized that "children are in danger." Defending the happiness of children became everyone's common desire, and the conference opened on the basis of this common desire.
    During the five-day meeting, we and the representatives from various countries discussed the education, health, and moral education of children. We heard reports from various regions of the world, and countless vivid facts gave us a profound impression: On the one hand, the imperialist wars of aggression launched in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya have killed 300,000 children in Korea, and a large number of children have been murdered in Vietnam and Malaya. The reactionary governments of Greece and Spain detain a large number of patriotic children in concentration camps, subjected to inhuman abuse. Imperialists cruelly exploit the people of the colonies, forcing children to live extremely miserable lives. US imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan have created the most unfortunate fate for the Japanese people and children. Tens of millions of people have to sell their children because of poverty. India and Egypt are famous cotton-producing countries, but many children have no clothes to wear. In Algeria, children aged four to five often search for food in garbage dumps. In Cuba, thousands of children live in slums. In Egypt, millions of homeless children sleep under bridges and trees. The magnificent Iranian carpets used by imperialist tycoons are woven by the small hands of hungry Iranian children.
    In the countries of the war instigators, war preparations deprive their own children of happiness. The production of tanks, cannons, germ weapons, and atomic bombs has taken bread from the mouths of children and stripped clothes from their bodies. Imperialist arms expansion and war preparations have caused domestic inflation. Workers' wages are far from keeping up with the rising cost of living. To prepare for the massacre of humanity, US imperialism inhumanely conducts violent and barbaric education for children. The most obvious fact is the use of printing and distribution organizations under their monopoly to publish a large number of "comic books for children." These magazines are full of murder, robbery, and pornography. These magazines have an annual circulation of 700 million copies and are exported all over the world. Schools in New York, USA, hang a sign on each child, indicating their birthdate and blood type, so that they can identify the child's body once they are killed by an atomic bomb. Under this poisonous education, the psychology of American children has been severely damaged.
    On the other hand, what made us and the representatives of other countries feel excited and optimistic was hearing the reports from the socialist Soviet Union and various new democratic countries. In 1951, the Soviet Union spent 125 billion rubles to pay for people's allowances, and greatly increased the number of hospitals, maternity hospitals, and sanatoriums. In 1951, more than 6 million children lived in Young Pioneer palaces and sanatoriums. The Soviet Union rebuilt more than 82,000 schools after the war, which can accommodate 15 million children. Thanks to the successful completion of production plans, various new democratic countries have made significant progress in social welfare, medical care, and cultural facilities. For example, the German Democratic Republic increased its cultural and social welfare expenditures by 28 percent between 1950 and 1951. Poland allocated 31 percent of its total budget to develop children's welfare. Czechoslovakia's health care expenses in 1951 increased 15 times compared to 1939. Since 1947, Romania and Czechoslovakia have tripled the number of beds in maternity hospitals, and the infant mortality rate in various countries has decreased. In the Soviet Union, according to what we heard during our visit, infant mortality has become extremely rare.
    Facts speak louder than any eloquence.
    When people hear and see children living in misery, who can remain indifferent, except for the iron-hearted fascist beasts? Who can fail to think of their own beloved children? Representatives from various countries united in friendship on the basis of love for children and human sympathy. They recognized who is deliberately preparing for a massacre of humanity and who is fighting for human happiness and the happiness of children. They also recognized a definite truth—to defend children, we must defend peace. Therefore, when our delegation and the Korean delegation accused the troops of US imperialism of conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea and our northeast, all the representatives expressed their infinite sympathy and firm support for us. Many countries indignantly condemned this heinous crime of genocide in their proposals, and the US representatives also expressed their regret to the Korean and Chinese representatives. The condemnation of the US imperialist troops' atrocities of conducting bacteriological warfare was written in the declaration and the resolution on health in this atmosphere. It embodies the noble will of mankind.
    The conference listed many scientific achievements and thoroughly refuted the clichés created by the disciples of Malthus. These lackeys, in accordance with the intentions of American monopoly capitalists, promoted the absurd claim that the world's population is excessive and that there is not enough food to feed it. American and French reactionary propagandists said: War is a law of biology, "Let us not oppose the production of atomic bombs, it is in accordance with the will of nature!" But false and reactionary arguments cannot stand the test of facts. When Mr. Monod, a famous French scholar, listed the great achievements of the Soviet Union and China in peaceful production increases, this pseudo-science was shattered in front of the people of the world. In 1950, the Soviet Union began the project of turning the vast desert between the Volga River and the Caspian Sea into arable land. The completion of this huge project will produce enough food to feed 100 million people. China's water conservancy projects under construction were also mentioned at the conference. These facts provided a scientific basis for defeating reactionary arguments.
    In summary, the main achievements of the conference are the following four points:
    1.  Under the demand of defending children, the movement to defend world peace was further promoted. Defending children is the wish of every individual and every family. Therefore, the peace movement is closely integrated with everyone's demands. This is of great significance for widely mobilizing people in capitalist and colonial countries to participate in the peace movement.
    2.  The declaration and resolutions made by the conference will become the program of action for the people of the world to defend children and defend peace. It will promote the organization of various institutions for the defense of children in various countries, take action to stop wars of aggression, and fight to improve the living conditions of children.
    3.  The conference enabled the representatives to further understand the living conditions of children in various countries around the world, and thus recognize who is deliberately preparing for another massacre of humanity and who is truly fighting for human happiness.
    4.  This conference united many people who had never participated in the international peace movement or were unwilling to be involved in politics, creating an example of a united front that more broadly unites people from all walks of life in various countries to defend world peace.
    The declaration and resolutions of the conference are a program for defending children of world significance, and they are also meaningful for China. Our great motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has initially provided good conditions for the development of children's welfare and education after only two years of construction. In many respects, we have already realized or established the prerequisites for realizing the resolutions on children's education, health, and moral education made by the International Conference for the Defense of Children, but it will still take time and effort to fully realize them. We should promote their implementation step by step and in a planned way along with the development of the national economy. In celebrating this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day, I hope that the men and women compatriots across the country will strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea a hundredfold, and on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, launch a creative movement to increase production and practice economy, and create conditions for children to live a happy life. Consolidating our motherland is to defend our children. In terms of children's moral education, I request all parents and teachers across the country: We must thoroughly eliminate feudal ideas and behaviors that do not respect children's personality, such as beating, corporal punishment, and other behaviors that insult children's personality; we must educate our children with the spirit of five loves and internationalism. Writers should create beneficial spiritual food for children. In terms of health, all medical workers, doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and maternal and child health workers should always pay attention to and care about the health of children and mothers. In terms of education, various places can increase the number of schools or establish night schools and half-day schools to absorb a large number of children into schools according to the specific circumstances. Many parents in our country deeply realize the pain of illiteracy and should enable this generation of children to fully enjoy the right to cultural education. Teachers should educate children more carefully with new teaching methods. The men and women compatriots across the country should pay attention to the work of cultivating our new generation under the arduous task of building the motherland. Everyone has the responsibility to protect the safety and growth of children and to ensure that they receive a good education!

    保卫儿童必须保卫和平
    中国出席国际保卫  儿童大会代表团团长  康克清
    我们代表团的全体代表光荣地接受了中国人民的委托，出席四月中旬在维也纳召开的国际保卫儿童大会，五月二十一日返回我们祖国的首都——北京了。让我们向你们报告这次大会的情况和成就。
    出席这次大会的五百四十位代表，代表着六十四个国家内不同种族、语言，不同的宗教和政治信仰，生活在世界上不同的社会制度下的千万男女。可是他们无例外地都有着一个共同点，就是热爱自己的儿童。当以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们已经把世界的一部分人民投入战火，并且正在组织与准备进行更大规模的战争，使得世界上不同角落的孩子们都受到了威胁。他们发觉“孩子们在危险中”。保卫儿童的幸福便成了大家的共同愿望，大会就在这种共同愿望的基础上揭幕了。
    在五天的会议中，我们和世界各国的代表们共同讨论了儿童的教育、卫生和德育问题，听到了来自世界各地区的报告，无数的鲜明事实，给了我们一种深刻的印象：一方面就是帝国主义在朝鲜、越南和马来亚发动的侵略战争，已使朝鲜死掉了三十万儿童，越南、马来亚也有大批的儿童被残害了。希腊和西班牙的反动政府把大批的爱国者的儿童拘留在集中营里，受着非人的虐待。帝国主义者对殖民地人民进行残酷剥削，迫使儿童们过着极端悲惨的生活。美帝国主义和日本吉田反动政府，已经造成日本人民和儿童最不幸的命运，有成千万的人因为贫困不得不出卖他们的孩子。印度和埃及都是著名的产棉国家，但是许多孩子都没有衣服穿。在阿尔及利亚，四岁到五岁的儿童，经常在垃圾堆里寻找食物。古巴有成千的儿童住在贫民窟里。埃及有几百万无家可归的儿童睡在桥下和树下。帝国主义富翁们所用的华丽的伊朗地毯，就是伊朗的饥饿的儿童用他们的小手织成的。
    在战争发动者的国家里，战争准备剥夺了他们本国儿童的幸福。坦克、大炮、细菌武器和原子弹的生产，已经从儿童嘴里夺去了面包，从儿童身上剥去了衣服。帝国主义的扩军备战已造成国内通货膨胀，劳动者的工资收入，远赶不上逐日上升的生活费用。美帝国主义为了准备造成人类的大屠杀，便毫无人性地向儿童进行狂暴野蛮的教育。最明显的事实，就是利用他们所垄断的印刷和发行机构，出版了大量的“滑稽儿童画”。在这些画刊里充满了惨杀、抢劫和色情的内容。这种画刊每年发行量达七亿册，并输出到世界各地。美国纽约的学校给每个儿童挂上一个牌子，上面注明生辰和血型，准备一旦被原子弹炸死之后，能够辨认儿童的尸体。在这种毒害的教育下，美国儿童的心理已受到严重的残害。
    另一方面，使我们和其他国家的代表们都感到兴奋和乐观的，就是听到社会主义国家苏联的报告，以及各新民主主义国家的报告。在一九五一年，苏联花了一千二百五十亿卢布支付人民的津贴，并且大量增设医院、产科医院和休养所。在一九五一年住在少年先锋宫和休养所的孩子就有六百多万。苏联在战后重建了八万二千多所学校，可以容纳一千五百万儿童学习。各新民主主义国家，由于胜利地完成了生产计划，在社会福利医药和文化设备方面都有了显著的发展。例如德意志民主共和国在一九五零年至一九五一年间增加了文化、社会福利方面的经费百分之二十八，波兰用总预算的百分之三十一划作发展儿童福利事业的经费。捷克斯洛伐克在一九五一年的保健费用较一九三九年增加了十五倍。自一九四七年以来，罗马尼亚及捷克斯洛伐克将产科医院的病床增加了三倍，各国婴儿死亡率都降低了。在苏联根据我们参观时所听到的，婴儿的死亡已成了极意外的事了。
    事实是胜于任何雄辩的。
    当人们听到和看到孩子们处在不幸的生活里的时候，除非是铁石心肠的法西斯野兽，谁能无动于衷呢？谁能不想到自己所爱的儿童呢？各国代表们就在对儿童的爱和人类的同情心的基础上友好地团结起来了，他们认识到谁在处心积虑地准备人类的大屠杀，谁在为人类的幸福和儿童的幸福而奋斗。他们也认识了一个确切的真理——保卫儿童，必须保卫和平。因此，当着我们的代表团和朝鲜代表团控诉美帝国主义的军队正在朝鲜和我国的东北进行大规模细菌战的时候，全体代表对我们表示了无限的同情和坚决支援，不少国家在提案中愤慨地谴责这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，美国的代表们也向朝鲜和我国代表表示遗憾。谴责美帝国主义的军队进行细菌战的暴行，就在这种气氛中写在宣言和关于卫生的决议里，它体现了人类崇高的意志。
    大会列举了许多科学的成就，尽情地批驳了马尔萨斯的门徒所制造的滥调。这些奴才们秉承着美国独占资本家的意图，鼓吹什么世界人口过剩，粮食不够养活的荒谬言论。美国和法国的反动宣传家们说：战争是生物的法则，“让我们不要反对生产原子弹，它是顺应自然的意志的！”但虚伪和反动的论据是经不起事实的考证的。当法国的著名的学者莫诺先生列举出苏联和中国伟大的和平增产成就的时候，这种伪科学就在全世界人面前被击破了。苏联在一九五○年，开始了将伏尔加河和里海之间的广大沙漠变为良田的工程，这种巨大工程的完成，会生产足够一亿人民食用的粮食。中国正在兴修水利工程，也被大会提及。这些事实提供了击败反动论调的科学根据。
    总起来说，大会的成就主要有以下四点：
    一、在保卫儿童的要求下，更进一步地推动了保卫世界和平运动。保卫儿童是每个人每个家庭的愿望，因此，保卫和平运动便和每个人的要求密切结合起来。这对广泛动员资本主义和殖民地国家人民参加和平运动具有重大的意义。
    二、大会所做的宣言和决议，将成为世界人民保卫儿童、保卫和平的行动纲领，它将推动各国组织各种保卫儿童的机构，采取行动，制止侵略战争，为改良儿童的生活条件而斗争。
    三、大会使代表们对世界各国儿童的生活情况有了进一步的了解。从而认识到谁在处心积虑地准备另一次的对人类的大屠杀，谁是真正为人类的幸福而奋斗的。
    四、这次会议团结了许多从来没有参加过国际和平运动或从来不愿过问政治的人，创造了更广泛地团结世界各国各阶层人士保卫世界和平的统一战线的范例。
    大会的宣言和决议是具有世界意义的保卫儿童的纲领，对于中国同样是有意义的。我们伟大的祖国，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，仅仅经过两年多的建设，已经初步地提供了发展儿童福利和教育的良好条件。国际保卫儿童大会所作的关于儿童教育、健康和德育问题的决议，在许多方面，我们已经实现了或确立了实现的前提条件，但要充分地实现它们，还需要时间和努力。我们应随着国民经济的发展，有步骤有计划地推动执行。在庆祝今年的“六一”国际儿童节的时候，我希望全国男女同胞们百倍地加强抗美援朝运动，在“三反”“五反”斗争胜利的基础上，展开创造性的增产节约运动，给儿童创造幸福生活的条件。巩固我们的祖国，就是保卫我们的儿童。在儿童的德育方面，我向全国父母们和教师们请求：要彻底清除封建的不尊重儿童人格的思想和行为，如打骂、体罚以及其他污辱儿童人格的行为；要以五爱和国际主义精神来教育我们的儿童。作家们应替儿童创作有益的精神食粮。在卫生方面，所有的医务工作者、中西医师和妇幼卫生工作者应经常注意和关心儿童和母亲的健康。在教育方面，各地可根据具体情况，增设学校或设立夜校和半日制学校大量吸收儿童入学。我国有不少父母亲切身体会到文盲的痛苦，应使这一代的儿童充分享受文化教育的权利。教师们要更细心地用新的教学方法来教育儿童。全国男女同胞们都应该在建设祖国的繁重任务下重视起培养我们新一代的工作，谁都有责任保护儿童的安全和生长，并使他们受到良好的教育！
