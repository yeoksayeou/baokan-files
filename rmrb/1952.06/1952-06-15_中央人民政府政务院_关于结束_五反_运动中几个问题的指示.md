The State Administration Council of the Central People's Government
Instructions on Several Issues Concerning the Conclusion of the "Five-Anti" Movement

I. Principles for Finalizing and Handling Cases in the "Five-Anti" Movement

The "Five-Anti" Movement has entered its final stage in major and medium cities across the country. Therefore, the correct finalization and appropriate handling of various types of industrial and commercial households is crucial for consolidating the victory of the "Five-Anti" Movement and developing production. The principle for handling cases is "Strict in struggle, lenient in treatment; strict where strictness is due, lenient where leniency is due."

In order to successfully conclude this movement, eliminate the "five evils," transform industrialists and businessmen, and smoothly develop production after the elimination of the "five evils," it is necessary to oppose two deviations: One is ending the movement perfunctorily, especially misunderstanding the principle of lenient treatment, and lacking the necessary seriousness towards illegal industrial and commercial households, which would arouse dissatisfaction among workers and shop assistants, and lead unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen to re-engage in the "five evils"; the other is being unwilling to reasonably reduce the amount of illegal income calculated for industrial and commercial households with higher calculations, that is, being unwilling to seriously verify and correctly finalize cases based on actual illegal circumstances. Both of these are wrong.

Therefore, it is necessary to continue to grasp the spirit of combining leniency and strictness, and conduct the work of finalizing and handling cases in a pragmatic manner, striving to be reasonable and fair, so as to both facilitate the elimination of the "five evils" of industrialists and businessmen, and facilitate the unity of industrialists and businessmen to develop production and business.

II. On Verification and Finalization of Cases

In the "Five-Anti" Movement, the calculation of the amount of illegal income of industrial and commercial households in some areas has been too high or too broad due to reasons such as retroactive calculations, higher depreciation, broader scope of calculation, and inconsistent standards. In this regard, it is necessary to re-verify and finalize cases, and anything that should not be calculated must not be calculated, anything that may or may not be calculated should not be calculated, and anything that should be calculated must be calculated, so that it conforms to the principle of lenient treatment and is conducive to the rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce.

Verification and finalization of cases can generally be resolved through self-reporting and public discussion, and three-step review. The steps are as follows: first, industrial and commercial households conduct self-reporting and self-evaluation; then, workers put forward opinions; then, the city (district) frugality inspection committee reviews and finalizes the case after consultation, or the city (district) people's court renders a judgment. If an industrial or commercial household believes that the calculation is unreasonable, it may appeal to the city review committee or to the city people's court for a review or retrial. The city may establish a review committee as a consulting body for the city frugality inspection committee, composed of representatives from the industry and commerce bureau, the trade union, and the business community, in order to conduct consultations.

III. On Returning Illegal Gains and Paying Taxes

Illegal industrial and commercial households are generally only ordered to return illegal gains and pay taxes, and only a few are fined. Among severely illegal households, except for a very few serious cases that must be sentenced to higher fines, fines should generally be minimized; some of those who perform better can even be announced to be downgraded (for example, from severely illegal households or even completely illegal households to semi-law-abiding and semi-illegal households) and exempted from fines. Completely illegal households, except for a very few cases with extremely serious circumstances that must be sentenced to higher fines or confiscation of part or all of their property, should generally be able to continue to maintain production and operation after the fines.

In order to take care of production and revitalize the market, the refund period can be extended to after this winter. Those who have difficulties during the refund period may use other methods to replace the refund. Before this winter, those who voluntarily return cash or have already returned cash may also be accepted. For those who have already returned cash, if it is found after verification and finalization that the calculation is high and the refund is too much, the excess refund may be returned after democratic review, consultation, and verification.

IV. On the Coordination of "Three-Anti" Refunds and "Five-Anti" Finalization

Whenever bribery is investigated or money is recovered from industrial and commercial households due to the "Three-Anti" movement, regardless of any agency or department, it must first be reviewed and verified by the branch of the city frugality inspection committee after summoning the industrial and commercial households, and then approved by the city frugality inspection committee for unified handling. No agency or department shall summon, recover money, or impose fines directly on industrial and commercial households without approval. All those who have taken money and goods from industrial and commercial households before this must report to the city frugality inspection committee within a time limit for unified review and handling.

If the evidence of bribery and acceptance of bribes is conclusive, and both the corrupt elements and the industrial and commercial households have admitted it, it can be handled according to law; if only one party admits it or the whistleblower reports it, it must be based on conclusive material evidence before it can be prosecuted in the people's court and handled at its discretion.

If only one party admits it but the other party denies it, or if a third party reports it but both parties deny it, and there is no conclusive evidence, both parties can sign a settlement to conclude the case.

It is hoped that all localities will abide by the above instructions in order to smoothly conclude the current nationwide "Five-Anti" Movement.

### 中央人民政府政务院  关于结束“五反”运动中几个问题的指示

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于结束“五反”运动中几个问题的指示
    一、“五反”运动定案处理的原则
    “五反”运动在全国已经进行的各大、中城市均已进入结束阶段，因之目前对于各类工商户的正确定案、适当处理，是巩固“五反”运动胜利和发展生产的具有关键意义的工作。处理的原则是“斗争从严，处理从宽；应当严者严之，应当宽者宽之”。
    为了很好地结束这一运动，达到消灭“五毒”、改造工商业者和在消灭“五毒”之后顺利发展生产起见，必须反对两种偏向：一种是虎头蛇尾，草率结束，特别是误解处理从宽的原则，而对违法工商户缺乏应有的严肃性，以致引起工人和店员的不满，并因而导致不法工商业者再施“五毒”；一种是不肯将计算较高的工商户违法所得的数目合理地降下来，即不愿意根据实际违法情况，认真核实，正确定案。这些都是错误的。
    因此，必须继续掌握宽大与严肃相结合的精神，实事求是地进行定案处理工作，务求做到合情合理，始能既有利于清除工商业者的“五毒”，又有利于团结工商业者发展生产和营业。
    二、关于核实定案工作
    在“五反”运动中，各地对工商户违法所得数目的计算，有些方面由于追算较远、折价较高、计算范围较广、标准先后不同以及其他原因，以致计算偏高偏广的。在这方面，必须重新核实定案，不应该计算的一定不要计算，可计算可不计算的也不要计算，而应该计算的则必须计算，使既合乎处理从宽的原则，又利于工商业的迅速恢复和发展。
    核实定案，一般可采取自报公议、三审定案的方式解决之。其步骤如下：首先经过工商户自报自评；再经过工人提出意见；然后经过协商再由市（区）节约检查委员会审查定案，或由市（区）人民法庭判决。如工商户认为计算不合理时，尚可向市评议委员会或向市人民法院或人民法庭申述理由，请求复议或复审。市可成立评议委员会，作为市节约检查委员会的咨询机关，由工商局、工会及工商界代表组成之，以便进行协商。
    三、关于退财补税
    对违法工商户，一般只令其退财补税，少数才予以罚款。在严重违法户中，除极少数严重者须判处较多罚金外，一般亦应尽可能少罚；对其中若干表现较好的，还可宣布降级（例如从严重违法户甚至从完全违法户降为半守法半违法户）处理，免判罚金。对完全违法户，除极少数情节十分严重须判处较多罚金或没收其财产的一部或全部外，一般亦应使其在罚款后还能继续维持生产和经营。
    为了照顾生产和活跃市场，退款时间可延至今年冬季以后开始。其在退款期间确有困难者，得以其他方法代替退款。今年冬季以前，如自愿退出现款或已经退出现款者，亦可接收。对于目前已经退出现款者，如在核实定案后发现算得高、退的多者，可经过民主评议、协商、审核，将其多退部分归还。
    四、关于“三反”退赃与“五反”定案工作相配合的问题
    凡因“三反”追查行贿或向工商户追赃时，无论任何机关、任何部门，均须首先经过市节约检查委员会区分会传讯工商户审核证实后，再经市节约检查委员会批准，统一办理。任何机关、任何部门均不得不经批准即直接向工商户传讯、起赃和罚款。凡在此以前，曾有自工商户中取走款物者，均须向市节约检查委员会限期补报，以便统一审核处理。
    凡属行贿、受贿证据确实者，如贪污分子及工商户均已承认，自可依法处理；如仅为一方承认或检举人检举，必须其物证确凿，方可依法向人民法庭（或人民法院）起诉，酌情办理。
    凡仅一方承认而对方否认或被第三者检举而双方均不承认，又均无确实证据者，即可由双方具结，分做结论，以了此案。
    以上各项指示，望各地遵照执行，以顺利结束目前全国的“五反”运动。
          总理  周恩来
            一九五二年六月十三日
