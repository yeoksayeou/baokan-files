    Overcoming Personal Plans to Do a Good Job in Economic Work
    Editor: According to my understanding, after the "Three-Anti" movement, some economic workers in Beijing have become hesitant in their work and even unwilling to continue doing economic work. It was entirely correct for the China Petroleum Corporation's Price Department to investigate the individual behavior of some comrades who leaked economic intelligence during the "Three-Anti" movement. However, now some comrades managing price lists are afraid to work. When various departments of our company, other organizations, and even higher-level leading organizations inquire about petroleum prices, they refuse to answer and must seek approval from leaders. Staff at a certain district cooperative's distribution point would rather let daylily buds spoil than sprinkle water on them. They say, "It's better to do less than to do more, because sprinkling water will make people suspect that you want to cheat on the weight." Some procurement personnel at the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company insist on working in pairs. They say, "One person for personal gain, two people for the public." This way, they can have witnesses during future inspections. This affects work efficiency and causes undue losses to the business.
    Why are these people afraid to deal with private merchants and hesitant to work? This is because they have not correctly understood the great significance of the "Three-Anti" movement, cannot withstand the test of revolutionary struggle, and lack confidence in their own revolutionary qualities. In order to "protect themselves wisely" and "keep themselves clean," these people push one person's work to two people, and even watch national wealth suffer losses and remain indifferent. This is a very serious situation! We hope that Comrade Wang Guisheng and other comrades with this kind of thinking will seriously examine their individualistic thoughts, further draw a clear ideological line with the bourgeoisie, and make themselves brave fighters on the economic front.

### 克服个人打算做好经济工作

    克服个人打算做好经济工作
    编辑同志：据我了解，在“三反”运动以后，北京市也有某些经济工作人员，在工作上变得束手束脚，甚至不愿意再干经济工作了。中国石油公司物价部在“三反”运动中检查了个别同志泄漏经济情报的行为，这是完全正确的。但现在有些管理牌价的同志，竟不敢工作了。本公司各科，其他机关，甚至上级领导机关向他们询问石油牌价，他们都不肯答复，必须找领导批准。某区合作社分销处的工作人员，宁可让黄花菜干坏了也不洒水。他们说：“多一事不如少一事，洒了水要被人家怀疑想在秤份量时捣鬼。”中国煤业建筑器材公司有些采购人员，坚持要两个人一起出去工作。他们说，“一人为私，二人为公。”将来检查时能作见证。这就影响了工作效率，使业务受了不应有的损失。
    为什么这些人不敢和私商打交道，工作起来束手束脚呢？这是因为他们没有正确地领会“三反”运动的伟大意义，经不起革命斗争的考验，对自己的革命品质缺乏信心。这些人为了“明哲保身”“洁身自好”，把一个人的工作推给两个人做，甚至看着国家财富遭受损失而置之不理。这是多么严重的情况！我们希望王贵生同志以及有这种思想的同志们，认真检查自己的个人主义思想，进一步和资产阶级划清思想界限，使自己成为经济战线上的勇敢战士。  宗景范  史庄仪    俞浣人
