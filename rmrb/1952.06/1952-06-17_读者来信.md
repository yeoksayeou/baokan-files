Summary of Reader Letters
Protesting the American Aggressors' Large-Scale Massacre of Our Captured Personnel

Many readers have written to our newspaper to oppose the American aggressors' planned and large-scale massacre of our captured personnel and to firmly support the just struggle of our captured personnel. All the employees of the First Track Maintenance Section of the Qiqihar Railway Engineering Section wrote to express that they would do a good job in track maintenance, improve track quality and ensure speed, and ensure that trains carry more and run faster, to support our most beloved volunteers and strive for the early freedom of the captured personnel of China and Korea. All teachers, students and staff of Peking University wrote: The American aggressors used tanks, flamethrowers and concussion grenades to carry out a frenzied massacre of our unarmed captured personnel and used captured personnel as experimental subjects for bacteria, poison gas and atomic bombs. This shows that the cruelty and shamelessness of American imperialism have reached an unprecedented level. These crimes of the American aggressors have aroused greater anger and hatred from the people of the world, prompting them to wage a resolute struggle against the aggressors. Chinese students studying in Poland wrote: The inhumane atrocities committed by the American aggressors on Geoje Island are intolerable to human justice. We firmly believe that the atrocities of the American aggressors will surely be severely punished by the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world!

We Should Seriously Examine Bureaucratic Work Style
Summary of Reader Letters

After our newspaper published the article "I Encountered Many Obstacles When Reporting a Counter-Revolutionary Element" by cart driver Zhang Shunyou on May 30, readers wrote in droves, expressing great indignation at the bureaucratic elements.

Reader Comrade Ge wrote: "I hate those bureaucratic elements. What a terrible attitude they are using to treat the masses of people, and what a shameful attitude they are using to treat the people's revolutionary cause!" Zhai Zhongfeng from the Cadre School of the Beijing Municipal People's Government wrote: "In our public security and judicial departments - the institutions of the people's democratic dictatorship - there are some cadres who treat cases of reporting counter-revolutionaries with such a bureaucratic attitude, which is intolerable." Reader Gengsheng wrote: "When the Guisui Public Security Bureau escorted prisoners, they also handcuffed the person who reported them; the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau detained the person who reported them for two hours. Didn't the heads of these two public security bureaus think about what consequences their actions would cause? What a great negative impact it would have politically?" Gao Ruilin, Xia Naijie, Dong Yuxin, Cui Wenrui, Tang Wenjun, Zhao Zhi and others from the Beijing Railway Bureau's regional training class wrote: "What is especially intolerable is the cadre of the Huoxian Public Security Bureau. They actually said: 'We can't solve it now because we are in the midst of the Three-Anti Movement.' As the People's Daily's brief commentary said that day, they don't even understand what the great 'Three-Anti' Movement is against." Readers Ji Yanzhi, Chen Yunyu, Yu Zongren, Lu Rufu, Guo Yuxiu, Wang Huiyao, Miao Mingguang and others wrote: Now that various agencies are conducting democratic refresher courses, leading comrades should learn from this incident, take the lead, and seriously examine similar bureaucratic work styles. Jiao Zeen from the Preparatory Office of the North China Sugar Factory wrote: "I think it is very correct for the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to seriously handle this matter." Liang Qizhuang and Wu Zhebo from the Planning Section of the Head Office of the Bank of Communications wrote: "We urgently hope that the departments related to this case will conduct a good examination and take appropriate action against the relevant personnel to educate cadres and the masses." Chang Jiwen, a student at Beijing Agricultural University, wrote: "After seeing that the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee prepared to transfer the responsible party members related to this matter to the North China Bureau for inspection and compensated Zhang Shunyou's travel expenses, I realized even more that the Communist Party is always responsible to the people, and I realized even more the correctness and greatness of the Communist Party."

Correct the Attitude of Serving the People

Editor Comrade: After reading the news published in the People's Daily that the cart driver Zhang Shunyou encountered many obstacles in reporting counter-revolutionaries, I hated those bureaucratic elements to the core. I believe that as long as a Communist Party member has a little Party spirit, as long as a revolutionary worker has a little thought of serving the people, they will feel heartache about this matter.

The courts of our People's Government are tools of the people's democratic dictatorship. However, a cadre of the Guisui Municipal People's Court actually said, "I don't care whether it's counter-revolutionary or not." I want to ask the person who said this, if you don't care about even counter-revolutionary elements, then what does the law of the People's Republic of China "care" about in your court?

The cadre of the Second Branch of the Guisui Municipal Public Security Bureau shirked responsibility for this matter, saying: "No materials were found." Please, isn't the material reported by the cart driver Zhang Shunyou "material"? Even if the material reported by Zhang Shunyou is not true, you should conduct investigations and research! You want Zhang Shunyou to "start a dispute" before you solve it, and after the dispute arises, you treat it as a "civil case, a wage dispute." Is the counter-revolutionary issue not supposed to be handled? I really don't know why you are so brave in bullying workers, but so lenient towards counter-revolutionary elements?

I hope that the cadres related to this matter will look back and see what things you have recorded in your work diary, think about the people's entrustment to you, check what things you have done, and correct your attitude of serving the people! I also hope that the leaders of the relevant agencies will, based on this incident, examine the work of their own agencies and become an executive institution of the people's democratic dictatorship in name and in fact.

Learn from Comrade Gao Yubao

Since our newspaper published Comrade Gao Yubao's novel "Midnight Cry of the Rooster" and his article "How I Study Culture and Learn to Write," we have successively received letters from Hou Yuzhong, Li Shangang, Zhang Yuquan, Zhang Shouheng, Wang Jiuduo, Ye Zhou, Yang Qinzhi, Huang Zhihua, Li Ya, Cheng Xiaochang... Everyone praised Comrade Gao Yubao's novel, admired his perseverance and tenacious spirit of learning, and expressed that they wanted to learn from him.

Cheng Xiaochang said in his letter: "Comrade Gao Yubao studies during the breaks in battle, studies during marching, and even dreams of studying culture while sleeping. This arduous and tenacious spirit of learning is the fundamental reason for his success, and I am deeply moved by him."

Zhang Yuquan's letter said: "Now I am studying in junior high school, and my learning conditions are much better than Gao Yubao's, but my grades are not very good. Compared with Comrade Gao Yubao, I am really ashamed. In the future, I will learn from Gao Yubao's experience, make up my mind, study hard, and often conduct self-criticism. Only in this way can I be worthy of the country and the people's cultivation of me."

Wang Jingbo's letter said: "Comrade Gao Yubao, who originally only knew a few hundred characters, actually wrote a novel of two or three hundred thousand words. This has to be said to be a miracle. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the era of Mao Zedong, can such a miracle occur. Gao Yubao's achievements, in addition to making me love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party even more, have also made me determined to learn from Gao Yubao."

Xiong Hanyang said in his letter: "I often think, if I could write the heroes and heroic deeds in the army into books to encourage comrades to fight, how wonderful that would be! But I also feel that it would be very difficult for someone like me to write books. After reading Gao Yubao's article, I felt that as a soldier of Mao Zedong, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. I want to treat my own learning with the spirit of Comrade Gao Yubao's hard work and hard training."

Hope to Hold More Exhibitions on Cultural Construction in People's Democratic Countries

Editor Comrade: The "Polish Poster Exhibition" sponsored by the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Liaison of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government is a very good exhibition. This exhibition reflects the Polish people's struggle against the US imperialism's incitement of new wars of aggression, striving for lasting peace, and striving for the victorious completion of the Six-Year Plan. It also reflects the Polish people's peaceful construction achievements and happy life under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party.

In the past, we knew more about the economic construction of the people's democratic countries, but we knew less about their cultural life. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to hold exhibitions such as the "Czech Satirical Painting Exhibition" and the "Polish Poster Exhibition." Through these exhibitions, we can better know the achievements of the people's democratic countries in culture and art, so as to promote cultural exchanges between each other.

The Publishing Industry Should Improve Bookbinding Technology

Editor Comrade: Recently, the Harbin City Library purchased a batch of "Heroes of Lüliang" (the first edition of the Beijing remake) published by the People's Literature Publishing House in April 1952. The book has a total of six hundred and twelve pages, bound with thin thread in three holes. After we bought these books, we only sorted them out, and before we sold them to readers, one-third of them had broken threads and cracked open, the spines were concave, and the edges of the books were uneven, becoming almost waste products. We feel very heartbroken! The broken thread phenomenon of some thicker books published by the Kaiming Bookstore is not serious, but the outside of the spine has already cracked. For example, "Selected Works of Ding Ling", "Short Stories of Ba Jin", etc., have this situation. This kind of binding method invisibly shortens the life of the book, which is also a waste for readers. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, I think this phenomenon can no longer continue to exist.

    读者来信
    抗议美国侵略者大规模屠杀我方被俘人员
    ——读者来信综述
    许多读者给本报来信，反对美国侵略者有计划地大规模地屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行，并坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义斗争。齐齐哈尔铁路工务段第一养路工区全体职工来信表示，他们要作好线路维修工作，提高线路质量和保险速度，保证火车拉得多、跑得快，支援我们最可爱的志愿军，争取中朝被俘人员早日获得自由。北京大学全体师生员工来信说：美国侵略者用坦克、喷火器、震荡手榴弹向手无寸铁的我方被俘人员进行疯狂的屠杀，并把被俘人员做为细菌、毒气、原子弹的试验品，这说明美帝国主义的残酷和无耻，已到了史无前例的地步。美国侵略者这些罪行，已经激起了世界人民更大的愤怒与仇恨，使他们对侵略者进行坚决的斗争。我国在波兰的留学生来信说：美国侵略者在巨济岛所干的惨无人道的兽行，是人类正义所不能允许的。我们坚信，美国侵略者的暴行必定要受到中朝人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的严厉制裁！
    应该认真检查官僚主义作风
    ——读者来信综述
    五月三十日本报发表了赶车工人张顺有的“我检举反革命分子时遭遇了重重阻难”一文后，读者纷纷来信，对官僚主义分子表示极大的愤慨。
    读者戈同志来信说：“我痛恨那些官僚主义分子。他们是在用多么恶劣的态度对待人民群众，他们是在用多么可耻的态度对待人民革命事业！”北京市人民政府干部学校翟中峰来信说：“在我们的公安、司法部门——人民民主专政的机构内，竟有一些干部，用这样的官僚主义态度来对待检举反革命的案件，是使人不能容忍的。”读者更生来信说：“归绥市公安局押解犯人时，也给检举人带上手铐；阳高县公安局把检举人扣押了两个钟头。这两个公安局的负责人就没有想一想，他们这种作法会引起怎样的后果？在政治上将会造成多么大的坏影响？”北京铁路分局地区训练班高瑞林、夏乃杰、董玉鑫、崔文瑞、唐文俊、赵鋕等来信说：“尤其令人不能容忍的是崞县公安局的干部。他们竟然说：‘现在正值三反运动，我们没办法解决。’这正如当日人民日报的简评所说的，他们甚至连伟大的‘三反’运动究竟是反对什么都不了解。”读者季砚之、陈云堉、于宗仁、卢汝孚、郭毓秀、王蕙尧、缪明光等来信说：现在各机关正在进行民主补课，领导同志应该接受这一事件的教训，以身作则地、认真地来检查类似的官僚主义作风。华北糖厂筹备处焦泽恩来信说：“我认为中共中央华北局严肃地处理这件事情，是非常正确的。”交通银行总管理处计划科梁绮庄、吴哲波等来信说：“我们迫切地希望与该案有关的部门，好好地进行检查，并对有关人员进行适当处理，以教育干部和群众。”北京农业大学学生常纪温来信说：“我看到中共中央华北局准备把和这件事情有关的负责党员调到华北局进行检查，并补偿了张顺有的路费之后，我更认识到共产党是永远对人民负责的，我更加体会到共产党的正确和伟大。”
    端正为人民服务的态度
    编辑同志：我看了人民日报登载的赶车工人张顺有检举反革命分子遭遇到重重阻难的消息，我对那些官僚主义分子恨透了。我相信，只要是稍有一点党性的共产党员，只要是稍有一点为人民服务的思想的革命工作人员，对这件事都会感到痛心的。
    我们人民政府的法院是人民民主专政的工具。但是，归绥市人民法院的干部竟说出“反革命不反革命我不管”的话来。我要问问说这种话的人，如果你们连反革命分子都不管，那么在你们那个法院里，中华人民共和国的法律还“管”什么呢？
    归绥市公安二分局的干部对这件事推诿说：“没有发现材料。”请问，赶车工人张顺有检举的材料不是“材料”吗？就说张顺有检举的材料不确实，你们也该进行调查研究啊！你们要张顺有“起个纠纷”才给解决，起了纠纷以后，你们又把这件事当作是“民事案件，工资纠纷”，难道其中的反革命问题不该管吗？我真不知道你们为什么这样勇于欺负工人，而对反革命分子反倒那样宽大？
    我希望和这件事有关的干部们，都回过头去看一下。看一看你们的工作日记上记过什么事情，想想人民对你们的嘱托，检查一下你们做了那些事情，端正你们为人民服务的态度！我还希望各有关机关的领导者，都根据这一事件，来检查本机关的工作，成为一个名符其实的人民民主专政的执行机构。

    向高玉宝同志学习
    本报自发表了高玉宝同志的小说“半夜鸡叫”和他的文章“我是怎样学习文化和学习写作的”以后，接连收到侯玉中、李善刚、张育泉、张寿恒、王九多、叶洲、杨钦之、黄治华、李亚、成肖昌………的来信；大家称赞高玉宝同志的小说，敬佩他的坚毅顽强的学习精神，并表示要向他学习。
    成肖昌在信中说：“高玉宝同志在战斗的间隙学习，在行军时候学习，甚至在睡觉的时候，作梦还学习文化。这种坚苦顽强的学习精神，是他获得成功的基本原因，我深深地被他感动了。”
    张育泉的来信说：“现在我在初中学习，我的学习条件不知比高玉宝好多少，但是我的成绩不大。和高玉宝同志比起来，真是太惭愧了。我今后要学习高玉宝的经验，下定决心，努力学习，并且经常进行自我批评。只有这样，我才对得起国家和人民对我的培养。”
    王静波的信中说：“原来仅仅认得几百个字的高玉宝同志，居然写了一本二三十万字的小说，这不能不说是一个奇迹。只有在共产党领导下，在毛泽东时代，这种奇迹才能出现。高玉宝的成就，除了使我更加热爱毛主席、热爱共产党之外，并且使我下定了向高玉宝学习的决心。”
    熊汉扬在信中说：“我经常想，假如我能把部队里的英雄和英雄事迹写成书，鼓励同志们战斗，那是多么好呀！可是我又觉得像我这样的人，写书会有很多困难。看了高玉宝的文章以后，我感到作为
    一个毛泽东的战士，是没有克服不了的困难的。我要用高玉宝同志苦学苦炼的精神对待自己的学习。”
    希望多举办人民民主国家文化建设方面的展览会
    编辑同志：中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会对外文化联络事务局主办的“波兰招贴画展览会”，是一个很好的展览会。这个展览会反映了波兰人民反对美帝国主义煽动新的侵略战争，争取持久和平、争取胜利完成六年计划的斗争情况，也反映了波兰人民在波兰统一工人党领导下和平建设的成就和幸福的生活情形。
    我们过去对于人民民主国家的经济建设情形知道得比较多，而对他们的文化生活则了解得比较少。因此，经常举行像“捷克讽刺画展览会”、“波兰招贴画展览会”这一类的展览会，是完全必要的。通过这些展览会，我们更能知道人民民主国家在文化艺术方面的成就，以促进彼此间的文化交流。

    出版界应改进书籍装订技术
    编辑同志：最近哈尔滨市图书馆买进一批人民文学出版社在一九五二年四月出版的“吕梁英雄传”（北京重排第一版）。该书共六百一十二页，三眼细线装订。我们买到这些书，只整理了一番，还没有卖给读者，就有三分之一已断线裂开，书脊凹进，书口参差不齐，几成废品。我们感觉十分痛心！开明书店出版的某些比较厚的书，断线现象虽不严重，但书脊外面已经裂开。如“丁玲选集”、“巴金短篇小说集”等，都有这种情形。这种装订办法，无形中缩短了书的寿命，对读者也是一种浪费。在“三反”“五反”运动之后，我认为这种现象是不能再继续存在下去的。
