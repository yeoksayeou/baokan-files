    Donate it to the Chinese Red Cross
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] To express their ardent love for the motherland, Overseas Chinese in Indonesia decided in 1951 to raise 200,000 Indonesian盾 to purchase quinine and donate it to the Red Cross Society of China for use in medical and health services for the people of the motherland. The quinine has now been purchased by the Jakarta Overseas Chinese Solidarity Promotion Association (note: the association was reorganized into the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Chinese General Association on April 25 this year) and transported to Beijing, totaling 180 boxes, with a total of 4.5 million tablets. The Red Cross Society of China sent a letter to the Jakarta Overseas Chinese Solidarity Promotion Association to express its respect and gratitude for the lofty patriotism of the Indonesian compatriots.

    印尼华侨购大批金鸡纳霜
    赠送中国红十字会
    【新华社四日讯】印尼华侨为了表示热爱祖国的热忱，曾在一九五一年间决定筹募印尼币二十万盾，购买金鸡纳霜，赠给中国红十字会总会，用在为祖国人民服务的医药卫生事业上。现该项金鸡纳霜已由雅加达华侨团结促进会（按：该会已于今年四月二十五日改组为雅加达中华侨团总会）购妥运到北京，总计一百八十箱，共四百五十万粒。中国红十字会总会特函雅加达华侨团结促进会，对印尼侨胞这种崇高的爱国主义精神表示敬意和感谢。
