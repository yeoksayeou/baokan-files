    American Bandits' Bombs Cannot Destroy the Will and Determination of the Working Class
    Industrial Labor Model Zhao Guoyou
    Hearing that American imperialists bombed the hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River, my heart is filled with extreme hatred. I am a worker, and I understand that power plants are places that provide people with light and warmth, and provide production with power; they are not military facilities. The American imperialists insist on calling them "military targets," which is blatant lying.
    This shameless provocation by American imperialism will not achieve its despicable goals; it will only further arouse the indignation of peace-loving people and increase the strength to fight against American imperialism. I remember when I went to Korea last year to offer my condolences, I visited some mines. I saw with my own eyes that although American planes came to bomb almost every day, the Korean worker brothers were not afraid. If they were bombed during the day, the workers would repair them at night, and production would never stop. Even if the power generating machines were damaged and there was no time to repair them, the workers used hand-cranked machines to produce anyway. The wisdom and strength of the working class cannot be destroyed or broken. On the contrary, like grinding electricity, the more it is ground, the more it shines. The more shamelessly American bandits destroy, the more we will strive to build, and build even better. American imperialism also bombed the Shanghai Power Plant, and the coal conveyor was damaged. The worker brothers in Shanghai rushed to repair the machine, while thousands of people used their hands to transport coal to generate electricity, without stopping for a minute. The bombs of American imperialism cannot destroy the will and determination of the working class.
    The power of hundreds of millions of people united is the greatest power, which American imperialism can never destroy. Its recklessness will only accelerate its demise. Because it has done so, the people will hate it even more, unite more closely, and fight against it. They will become even more isolated.
    We Chinese people and Chinese workers cannot sit idly by and watch this provocation. Our worker brothers must do a good job in the patriotic production increase movement, achieve greater victories on the production front, and further strike at the barbaric atrocities of American imperialism.

    美国强盗的炸弹炸不掉工人阶级的意志和决心
    工业劳动模范  赵国有
    听到美帝国主义轰炸鸭绿江上的水力发电厂，我心里痛恨极了。我是工人，我懂得发电厂是供给人民以光明和温暖、供给生产以动力的地方，并不是什么军事设施。美帝国主义却硬说它是“军事目标”，那是瞪着眼睛说瞎话。
    美帝国主义这一无耻的挑衅，决不能达到它的可耻目的，只能进一步激起爱好和平人民的愤恨和增加对美帝国主义进行斗争的力量。记得去年到朝鲜去慰问时，我曾经参观过一些矿厂。我亲眼看到：虽然美国飞机差不多每天来轰炸，但朝鲜工人兄弟并不害怕。白天炸了，夜里工人就修复，生产决不停止。也曾经有发电机器被炸坏了，一时来不及修理，工人用手摇机器也一样生产。工人阶级的智慧和力量是炸不掉、打不烂的。相反的，像磨电一样，愈磨愈发出光芒。美国强盗愈加无耻地破坏，我们就愈加努力地建设，而且建设得更好。美帝国主义也曾经轰炸过上海电力厂，运煤机被炸坏了。上海工人兄弟们一面赶修机器，一面由几千人用手传送煤来发电，一分钟也不停止。美帝国主义的炸弹是炸不掉工人阶级的意志和决心的。
    千百万人民团结的力量是最伟大的力量，是美帝国主义永远破坏不了的。它这样胡作妄为，只是加快它的灭亡。因为它这样做了，人民会更加仇恨它，更紧密地团结起来，和它斗争。它们将更加孤立。
    我们中国人民和中国工人是不能坐视它这种挑衅的。我们工人兄弟要搞好爱国增产运动，在生产战线上取得更大胜利，进一步打击美帝国主义野蛮暴行。
