The wheat is ripe. Launching a wheat seed selection campaign among farmers has become an urgent task. To promote mass wheat seed selection, the Taizhou Special District Farm in Zhejiang held a wheat field exhibition on May 15th. They invited more than 80 representatives from agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers from various districts and townships near Linhai County to visit. In addition, many people freely visited the farm.

The fields were golden. The people at the farm were beaming with joy. Bright red national flags fluttered in the wind. In the afternoon, when everyone had arrived, they set off in groups to begin the tour. They first visited the wheat "cultivation demonstration" and "variety comparison" areas. Last year, the farm planted more than ten varieties of wheat to conduct variety comparison trials. Farm workers and technical cadres introduced the characteristics and growth conditions of each variety to the visitors, and then asked the visitors to evaluate them. After discussion, everyone agreed that "Zhenong No. 17" and "Dwarf Grain Many" wheat were the best, and "Luoyang Qing" and "Zhenong No. 9" were also good. Many farmers were most interested in "Dwarf Grain Many" because this variety has strong resistance to rust and cold, and its stalks are hard and thick, making it less prone to lodging. The farmer representatives took a large ear of wheat and counted it, finding more than one hundred grains. They said: Taizhou needs high-yielding wheat varieties like this that are disease-resistant, cold-resistant, and lodging-resistant. He Daqing, a farmer from Shanhai Village, Chengxi District, said: The wheat planted by our mutual aid team grew very well at the beginning, and everyone praised it. Later, after a spring snow, some of it was damaged by frost; recently, after two strong winds, some of it lodged. We originally planned to increase production by 20%, but instead we will reduce production by 20%. This is the result of poor varieties. They paid close attention to the various wheat varieties. Everyone picked the best ears from their favorite varieties in the wheat field and took a large handful. They wanted to take these wheat seeds home to compare with local wheat and prepare for trial planting next year. In the wheat propagation demonstration area, they saw the comparative trial of "Zhenong No. 9" and the local variety "Red Wheat". The height of the wheat in these two areas was very different. In two different wheat fields with plowing depths of three to four inches and five to six inches, they saw that the growth conditions of the wheat were different. They especially counted the number of rows of grains on the ears of wheat. The ears of wheat in the deep-plowed fields averaged more than eleven rows, while the ears of wheat in the fields plowed three to four inches deep had a maximum of only nine rows. They were very interested in "Two-Row" barley, which has strong tillering ability, hard stalks that do not lodge, and thin, white flour, and most people were willing to try planting it under contract this year.

After visiting the wheat "cultivation demonstration" and "variety comparison" areas, they gained a deeper understanding of the important significance of wheat seed selection. They saw that on the same land, using the same planting methods, and applying the same amount of fertilizer, various different results were clearly shown simply because the seeds were different. They picked the largest ears of wheat in the wheat field to count the number of grains, which strengthened their confidence in implementing single-ear selection. They unanimously stated: After returning to the village, we must lead the masses to universally carry out ear selection, evaluate good varieties at each level, launch mutual seed exchange, and strive to eliminate all inferior varieties within three to five years and continuously increase yields.

After the farmer representatives visited the wheat fields, they held a discussion. They studied what the differences were between the production methods of the farm, the mutual aid teams, and the individual farmers, and everyone agreed that: the farm is a collective production unit, and the land is in large, continuous pieces, so production is planned, and land can be used rationally and labor can be allocated scientifically. They greatly admired the farm's achievement of sixteen workers planting 230 mu of land. They said that this could not be done in mutual aid teams or by individual farmers. They saw that the water buffalo raised on the farm were tall and fat, and they plowed the fields quickly and well. The farm workers' lives, cultural entertainment, and learning all had certain systems, and they were all working happily and actively. They estimated that this year's wheat yield on the farm would be more than 10% higher than that of ordinary farmers; other crops were also growing better than those of the farmers. They were all very envious of these things. Many representatives of mutual aid teams requested to exchange "Zhenong No. 17" and "Dwarf Grain Many" wheat seeds with the farm. A few farmers said: "The farm is run by the government, and it has money and fertilizer, so it can do a good job in production; our mutual aid team has no capital, so there is no way." This statement was refuted by other farmer representatives. They pointed out: By working hard in the mutual aid team and paying attention to technology, we can also improve varieties and increase yields.

    浙江台州专署农场的小麦田间展览会
    陈波涛　陈开仁
    麦子黄了。在农民中开展小麦选种运动，已成为紧迫的任务。为了推动群众性的小麦选种工作，浙江台州专署农场在五月十五日举行了一个小麦田间展览会。他们邀请了临海县城附近各区乡的农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民的代表八十多人，前来参观。另外，自由到该农场参观的还有许多人。
    田野里一片金黄。农场里的人们喜气洋洋。鲜红的国旗迎风招展。午后，人到齐了，大家分组出发，开始参观。他们首先参观了麦子的“栽培示范”和“品种比较”。这个农场去年种了十多种麦子，进行品种比较试验。农场工人和技术干部向参观者介绍了每一种品种的特点和生长状况，然后请参观的人进行评比。大家评比讨论后，认为“浙农十七号”和“矮粒多”小麦最好，“洛阳青”及“浙农九号”也不坏。很多农民对“矮粒多”最感兴趣，因为这个品种抗锈病力强，抗寒力强，秆子又硬又粗，不容易倒伏。农民代表们拿了一个大麦穗，数了一下，有一百多颗麦粒。他们说：我们台州很需要这样抗病、耐寒、不倒伏的高产麦种。城西区山海门村农民何达清说：我们互助组今年种的小麦，开始时生长得很好，人人称赞。以后落了一次春雪，有的冻坏了；最近又刮了两次大风，有的又倒了。我们原来计划增产二成，结果反而要减产二成。这是品种不好的结果。他们对各种不同的小麦品种都很注意。每个人都在麦田里挑选自己最心爱的品种当中的最好的麦穗，摘了一大把。他们要把这些麦种拿到家里去和本地小麦比较，并准备明年试种。在小麦繁殖示范区里，他们看到了“浙农九号”和土种“赤麦”对比试验的情况。这两个区的麦子的高低截然不同。他们在耕深三四寸和五六寸的两种不同的麦田里，看见麦子的生长状况是不同的。他们特别数了麦穗上籽粒横行的盘数，深耕田中的麦穗，平均在十一盘以上，耕三、四寸深的田中的麦穗，最多的只有九盘。他们对于分蘖力强、秆硬不倒伏、皮薄粉白的“二棱”大麦很感兴趣，大多数人都愿意在今年特约试种。
    参观了小麦“栽培示范”和“品种比较”之后，他们对小麦选种的重要意义有了进一步的认识。他们看到同样的土地，用同样的种法，施用同量的肥料，只因为种籽不同，就清楚地显出了各种不同的结果。他们在麦田里挑选最大的麦穗来数籽数，增强了实行单穗选种的信心。他们一致表示：回到村里，一定要带领群众，普遍进行穗选，逐级评比良种，发动相互换种，做到三五年内全部淘汰劣种，不断提高产量。
    农民代表参观了麦田以后，进行了座谈。他们研究农场、互助组和单干农民在生产方法上到底有什么区别，大家一致认识到：农场是集体生产的，场地是整块大片的，所以生产就有计划，能够合理地使用土地，科学地分配劳动力。他们很佩服农场十六个工人种二百三十亩田的成绩，他们说，这在互助组里或单干的农民是做不到的。他们看到：农场养的水牛高大肥胖，犁起田来又快又好。农场工人们的生活、文化娱乐、学习等等都有一定的制度，他们都是快乐地积极地劳动。他们估计，今年农场的小麦产量，比一般农民的要高出一成以上；其他各种作物生长得也都比农民的好。他们对这些都很羡慕。很多互助组的代表要求和农场掉换“浙农十七号”和“矮粒多”麦种。有少数农民说：“农场是公家办的，有钱有肥料，所以把生产搞很好；我互助组没有资本，没办法。”这种说法，受到了其他农民代表的反驳。他们指出：在互助组努力生产，讲求技术，也可以改良品种，提高产量。
