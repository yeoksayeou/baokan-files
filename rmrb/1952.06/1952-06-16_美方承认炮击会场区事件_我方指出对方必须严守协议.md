    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 14th. On June 5th, the U.S. side shelled the Panmunjom Korean armistice negotiation conference venue area, injuring three children within the conference venue area, creating a serious violation of the agreement. Our side's liaison officer was ordered to lodge a serious protest to the other side on June 6th. Although the other side made every effort to deny it, and even attempted to overturn the admission of the other side's conference venue area security officer, due to the presence of both witnesses and material evidence, they finally admitted the facts on June 14th and expressed regret. Our side's liaison officer was ordered to point out to the other side that the other side must strictly abide by the bilateral agreement and must not engage in any further acts that violate the agreement.

    美方承认炮击会场区事件
    我方指出对方必须严守协议
    【新华社开城十四日电】六月五日美方炮击板门店朝鲜停战谈判会场区，击伤会场区内幼童三名，造成了严重违反协议的事件。我方联络官奉命在六月六日向对方提出严重抗议，对方虽然百般抵赖，甚至于企图推翻对方会场区安全军官的供认，但由于人证物证俱在，终于在六月十四日承认了事实，表示遗憾。我方联络官奉命向对方指出了对方必须严格遵守双方协议，不得再有破坏协议的行为。
