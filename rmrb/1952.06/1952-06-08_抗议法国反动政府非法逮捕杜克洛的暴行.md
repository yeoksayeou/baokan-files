    Protest the French Reactionary Government's Illegal Arrest of Duclos
    To the Editor: Upon seeing the news in the newspapers of the French reactionary government under Pinay illegally arresting French Communist Party Secretary Duclos, we felt boundless anger. This fascist atrocity by the French reactionary government is intolerable.

    The French people's protest against the arrival in Paris of Ridgway, the germ warfare murderer stained with the blood of the Eastern peoples, is a completely just action. The Pinay reactionary government's series of reactionary suppression measures against this just action by the French people is clearly closely related to the United States' illegal signing of the "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community Treaty," the revival of West German militarism, and the creation of a tense situation in Europe.

    We, the Chinese people, warmly support the French people's just struggle against the Pinay reactionary government, and lodge a serious protest against the fascist crimes of the French Pinay reactionary government. The French reactionary government must immediately release Duclos and other patriots, and cease all terroristic bloody suppression, otherwise it will be subject to the just sanctions of peace-loving people all over the world.

    抗议法国反动政府非法逮捕杜克洛的暴行
    编辑同志：当我们从报纸上看到了法国比内反动政府非法逮捕法国共产党书记杜克洛的罪行后，感到无比的愤怒，法国反动政府这种法西斯暴行，是令人不能容忍的。
    法国人民抗议沾满东方人民鲜血的细菌战杀人犯李奇微到达巴黎，完全是正义的行动。比内反动政府竟对法国人民的这种正义行动采取了一连串的反动镇压措施，这显然和美国非法签订“一般性条约”，“欧洲防御集团条约”，复活西德军国主义，在欧洲制造紧张局势的行动有着密切的关系。
    我们中国人民热烈支持法国人民反抗比内反动政府的正义斗争，并向法国比内反动政府的法西斯罪行提出严重抗议。法国反动政府必须立即释放杜克洛等爱国人士，停止一切恐怖的血腥镇压，否则将受到全世界爱好和平人民的正义制裁。
