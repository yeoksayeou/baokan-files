The employees of the Qingdao Long-Distance Bus Station of the Shandong Provincial Highway Transportation Company have used the spirit of the Soviet Kovalev work method, concentrating everyone's excellent actions to improve car driving techniques. After preliminary trial promotion at the station, it not only saved a lot of gasoline, but also basically eliminated car accidents and "breakdown" incidents.

In the past, the driving methods of the bus station's workers were "one master teaching one apprentice," each with their own set of skills, passed down as habits and not improved. Last year, Chairman Mao called for the development of the increase production and practice economy movement, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all station employees to improve driving techniques. In order to truly concentrate the creative wisdom of the workers, under the leadership of the stationmaster and the director of the transportation department, a car driving technique investigation and research group was formed by selecting some excellent workers from each car team, responsible for technical measurement and summarization. Then, the investigation and research group mobilized the vast number of employees to discuss and analyze in detail the actions of many excellent driving workers, concentrating technical advantages; and selected Wang Xiangfeng, Wang Weizhong and other three excellent driving workers and their vehicles as typical examples for experimentation. The investigation and research group also sent people to follow the cars to record the three people's driving actions, brought back the materials, and then discussed, analyzed, compared, comprehensively summarized, and conducted a comprehensive summary. After half a year of efforts, the station finally completed a set of car driving techniques.

This set of car driving techniques has three characteristics: First, it can both maintain the machine and save fuel. For example, when the vehicle starts, shift gears in sequence, and do not skip gears (but when encountering steep slopes, gears can be skipped as appropriate), so that the difference between front and rear speeds is not too large, and the free joints of all gears are not easily damaged. When going uphill, use the momentum to change gears in time, and do not change gears until the vehicle is completely powerless. The advantage is that the car body is stable and gasoline can be saved. For example, when the vehicle is driving on uneven roads, maintain a certain speed. When encountering small pits or ditches, observe the terrain in advance, and flexibly turn the steering wheel to make the front wheels avoid or skew over the small ditches or pits as much as possible. This can reduce the jumping force of the wheels and avoid damage to steel plates and other parts. Second, it can reduce car accidents and ensure driving safety. For example, when the vehicle is turning, crossing a bridge, or passing through a traffic post, lift the accelerator at a distance of 50 meters and use the vehicle's inertia to move forward. In this way, if an obstacle is found, the vehicle's driving can be controlled immediately. When the vehicle is crossing a ditch, stop refueling 70 meters away from the ditch and use the car's inertia to drive to the edge of the ditch, and then change gears forward depending on the situation when the front wheel approaches the bottom of the ditch. For example, when the vehicle is going downhill, do not put it in neutral, let alone turn off the power (especially with air brakes), to avoid brake failure and danger. Third, the driver and assistant cooperate skillfully, which improves the vehicle utilization rate.

The trial promotion of this set of car driving techniques has achieved significant results at the station. In terms of saving gasoline, Wang Xiangfeng's large passenger car (a Steyr-branded 54-seat large passenger car) used to run only 9.7 kilometers per gallon of gasoline. Since he implemented regular car driving techniques, he can run 12.7 kilometers per gallon of gasoline. He also corrected some of his actions. He runs 4,464 kilometers in a month, and can save the country more than 100 gallons of gasoline. In the past, the large six-wheeled passenger cars from Qingdao to Yantai used 38 to 40 gallons of oil per trip (496 kilometers), but now the amount of oil used has dropped to 29 to 32 gallons.

### 青岛长途汽车站职工  用郭瓦廖夫工作法改进汽车驾驶法

    青岛长途汽车站职工
    用郭瓦廖夫工作法改进汽车驾驶法
    山东省公路运输公司青岛分公司长途汽车站职工运用苏联郭瓦廖夫工作法的精神，集中大家的优良动作，改进了汽车驾驶法，经该站初步试行推广后，不仅节省了大量汽油，并基本上消灭了汽车肇事与“抛锚”事故。
    该汽车站的工人们过去的驾驶法是“一个师傅传授一个徒弟”，各有一套，相传成习，不加改进。去年毛主席号召开展增产节约运动，大大鼓舞了全站职工改进驾驶法的热情。为了真正把工人的创造智慧集中起来，在站长和车务部主任的领导下，由各汽车分队选出一部分优秀工人组成了汽车驾驶法调查研究小组，负责技术测定并进行总结。接着，调查研究小组发动广大职工详细地讨论、分析了很多优秀驾驶工人的动作，集中了技术优点；又挑选出王祥凤、王维忠等三个优秀驾驶工人及其车辆为典型，进行试验。调查研究小组并派人分头随车记录三人的驾驶动作，带回材料，再讨论、分析、比较、综合，进行全面总结。该站经过半年来的努力，最后完成了一套汽车驾驶法。
    这套汽车驾驶法有三个特点：第一、既能保养机器，又能节约燃料。如车辆起车行驶时，按次序变速，不跳挡变速（但遇陡坡时可酌情跳挡），使前后速度相差不太悬殊，所有牙轮的自由关节不易受损害。上坡时，应利用冲力及时变速，不要等到车辆完全无力时再变速。好处是车身稳当，并可节省汽油。又如车辆行走在凸凹不平的道路上时，保持一定的速度。遇有小坑或小沟，应预先察看地形，灵活转动方向盘，使车辆的前轮尽可能的躲过或斜过小沟或小坑。这样可减少车轮的跳跃力，避免钢板等部受损。第二、可以减少汽车肇事，保证行车安全。如车辆在转弯、过桥、行经交通岗时，在相距五十米处抬起油门，利用车辆的惰力前进。这样，如发现障碍物时，可以随即控制车辆的行驶。当车辆过沟时，离沟七十米处就应停止加油，利用车的惰力行至沟沿，当前轮接近沟底时再视情换挡前进。又如车辆下坡时，不应摘空挡，更不可关电门（特别是汽刹车），避免刹车失灵发生危险。第三、司机助手配合动作熟练，提高了车辆运转率。
    这套汽车驾驶法在该站试行推广，已获得显著成绩。在节约汽油方面，王祥凤驾驶的大型客车（史蒂贝克牌五十四个座的大型客车）过去每加仑汽油只能跑九点七公里，自从他实行了正规的汽车驾驶法以后，每加仑汽油能跑十二点七公里，并纠正了自己某些动作上的缺点，他一个月内跑四千四百六十四公里，可以为国家节约一百多加仑汽油。从前，青岛到烟台的大六轮客车，往返一次（四百九十六公里），每辆车用油三十八至四十加仑，现在用油量降到二十九至三十二加仑。    （新华社）
