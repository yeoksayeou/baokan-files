    Jilin Wangqing County Jiguanliaozi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Assures Chairman Mao They Will Do a Good Job in Supply and Marketing Work
    Respected Chairman Mao: Our Jiguanliaozi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been established for more than five years, since 1946. When it was first established, our village was a poor village where nine out of ten families were poor peasants and hired laborers. After the land reform, we overthrew the landlords and were allocated land, houses, and livestock. However, at that time, there were only sixty livestock and thirty-five carts of various sizes in the village; the cooperative had only over one hundred members, and the funds were only over 24,000 yuan. But under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we have organized farmers to engage in sideline production and supported and expanded agricultural production over the past five years. Now the political consciousness, cultural level, and agricultural production technology of the farmers in our village have improved compared to the past, and their lives have generally improved. Eight out of ten of the village's former poor peasants have improved their lives to the level of middle peasants. The number of livestock has increased to 377, and the number of carts has increased to 154; in addition, 119 new houses have been built. The number of cooperative members has also increased to 1,249, and the funds have increased to over 180 million yuan. In more than five years, in addition to timely supplying the needs of farmers and cooperative members, our cooperative has successively established carpentry shops, blacksmith shops, rice mills, traditional Chinese medicine shops, credit unions, hospitals, kindergartens, and other units according to the requirements of farmers and cooperative members, and helped the village establish a complete primary school. Therefore, our cooperative has won the honor and reward of being a model cooperative eleven times.
    We know that these blessings are given to us by Chairman Mao. However, the beastly American bandits have come to destroy our happy life. They not only threaten us with planes and cannons, but also inhumanly spread bacteria, attempting to poison us. All the employees of our cooperative unanimously and firmly expressed that they will use practical actions to give the American aggressors a firm rebuff. We guarantee to do the following tasks well:
    1. Strengthen political current affairs study, improve political awareness, and cooperate with the village's Party and government work to carry out political current affairs propaganda to all farmers and cooperative members in the village, in order to further improve the political awareness of the people in the village;
    2. On the basis of orders placed by farmers, cooperative members, and mutual aid teams, conclude supply and marketing contracts that combine supply and marketing cooperatives with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Help mutual aid teams formulate production and consumption plans, so that everyone can carry out production and do a good job in supply and marketing work in a planned way;
    3. Do a good job in the credit union. It is planned to absorb 70 million yuan in deposits this year; and give priority loans to relatively poor families of martyrs, military families, and farmers to support them in engaging in sideline production;
    4. According to the requirements of farmers and cooperative members, complete the supply and marketing plan in a timely manner to accelerate capital turnover, reduce cost expenditures, and give full play to internal potential. It is planned to increase production and save 248 tons of grain this year (63 tons have been completed in the first quarter).
     All employees and members of the Jiguanliaozi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Third District, Wangqing County, Jilin Province

    吉林汪清县鸡冠砬子村供销合作社
    向毛主席保证做好供销工作
    敬爱的毛主席：我们鸡冠砬子村的供销合作社，自一九四六年成立到现在，已经有五年多了。当成立的时候，我们的村子还是个十家就有九家是贫雇农的穷村子。土地改革后，我们斗倒了地主，分到了土地、房屋和牲畜。可是那时村里还只有六十头牲口，三十五辆大、小车；合作社的社员只有一百多人，资金不过两万四千元。但在共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，我们五年来组织农民搞副业生产，扶持、扩大农业生产。现在我们村里的农民，政治觉悟、文化水平和农业生产技术比以前提高了，生活也普遍上升了。村里过去的贫农，十分之八生活都已上升到中农的水平。牲口已增加到三百七十七头，大、小车增加到一百五十四辆；此外还盖了一百一十九间新房子。合作社的社员也增加到一千二百四十九名，资金增到一亿八千多万元。在五年多当中，我们合作社除及时供应了农民社员的需要外，并根据农民社员的要求，先后设立了木匠铺、铁匠炉、精米所、中药铺、信用部、病院、幼稚园等单位，并帮助村里建立了一所完全小学。因此，我社先后获得过十一次模范社的荣誉和奖励。
    我们知道这些幸福是毛主席给我们的。但是，野兽般的美国强盗，竟来破坏我们美满的生活，他们不但用飞机、炮弹来威胁我们，而且还灭绝人性地散布了细菌，企图毒害我们。我社全体职工一致坚决表示要用实际行动给美国侵略者以坚决的回击。我们保证做好以下几项工作：
    一、加强政治时事学习，提高政治觉悟，并配合村里的党、政工作，向全村农民社员进行政治时事宣传，以进一步提高全村人民的政治觉悟；
    二、在农民社员和互助组定货的基础上，订立供销合作社和农业生产合作社、互助组之间结合的供销合同。帮助互助组订生产、消费计划，使大家有计划地进行生产和作好供销工作；
    三、搞好信用部，计划今年吸收存款七千万元；并有重点地贷款给较贫困的烈属、军属和农民，以扶持他们搞副业生产；
    四、根据农民社员要求，及时完成供销计划，以加速资金周转、缩减成本开支、发挥内在潜力，计划今年增产节约粮食二百四十八吨（第一季度已完成了六十三吨）。
