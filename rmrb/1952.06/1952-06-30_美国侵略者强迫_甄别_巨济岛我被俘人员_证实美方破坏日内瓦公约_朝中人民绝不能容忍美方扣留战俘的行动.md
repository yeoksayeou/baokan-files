Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 29th: This agency's special correspondent reports: The US Eighth Army announced that they have completed the shameless act of forcibly making 47,000 POWs on Koje Island give up their right to return home. It is believed here that this is one of a series of provocative actions recently taken by the US to continue and expand the Korean War. This vicious and shameless act of detaining POWs began on the day the US bombed the Yalu River hydroelectric power plants and was completed when Harrison fled the Panmunjom tent for the third time.

As everyone knows, the US shamelessly fabricated a figure of 70,000 of our captured personnel who would allegedly be repatriated, calling it the result of some kind of "screening." But this most outrageous act aroused public outrage and strong criticism around the world, so that the US had to admit through their journalists that the 70,000 figure was created "carelessly."

Having suffered such a severe blow from this shameless behavior, the US still refused to give up. In order to insist on detaining POWs, they illegally conducted a five-day "screening." This only serves to definitively show the world how barbaric and heinous the US's criminal intention to openly violate the Geneva Convention and deprive POWs of their individual right to demand to return home has become.

The US forced the POWs on Koje Island to choose between death and not returning home. But the POWs put up a heroic resistance. The US further mobilized more than a division of fully armed troops, with the help of British and Canadian troops, to forcibly divide the POWs into groups to ensure their "voluntary repatriation," which is actually forcibly detaining POWs.

Boatner made shameless threats to the POWs. He took the POW spokesmen to Camp 76 – the site where the US massacred POWs – to see the bodies of POWs who had resisted screening that had been cremated. After the POWs were dispersed, they were stripped of their clothes and driven into iron rooms with a machine gun tower in the middle. When the POWs refused to go out for "identity checks" and "fingerprinting," the US used tear gas. POWs were shot for singing. They were cut off from all contact with the outside world. They were interrogated in "secret rooms" by their murderous executioners.

This is the situation reported by reporters who are hostile to the POWs. And the facts reported by the POWs who suffered from Boatner's "voluntary repatriation" method, which American reporters did not report, are far more telling than the above. The following is the testimony of 6,223 Korean POWs who signed a letter secretly sent from Koje Island to North Korea last month:

May 18: Boatner ordered the dismemberment of thirteen POWs in front of the prisoners in Camp 76, where Dodd was being held.

On the same day, Boatner's troops killed 24 POWs in Camp 77 and told the POWs in Camp 46 that all POWs who wished to return to North Korea should gather outside the camp before 7 pm. All the POWs ran out. As a result, 127 POWs were massacred on the ground by machine guns and flame-throwing tanks.

May 20 and 21: More than 1,000 POWs were ordered to report to Boatner's office for questioning about "voluntary repatriation." As a result, 422 POWs never returned to the camp. More than 100 POWs returned to the camp with broken arms, covered in bayonet wounds, and with words stabbed into their backs and chests.

May 22 and 23: Boatner's troops attacked Camp 602 and Camp 73. Eighty-eight POWs were killed by machine guns and grenades.

May 23 (date of the letter): In Camp 76, four POWs were beheaded and their heads hung in trees.

This is only what happened within six days. From the massive amount of evidence provided by American reporters who are hostile to the POWs and by the POWs who suffered, the headquarters of the US invading army Eighth Army came to the conclusion that the "screening work" of the 47,000 POWs on Koje Island was completed on June 27 without "obstacles" or "incidents"!

In order to achieve their ulterior motives, the Pentagon and Clark played another bizarre logic. They wanted the world to believe that the promises and confessions made by Coleson, the commander of the Koje Island death camp at the time, were "invalid." Why? Because these promises and confessions were made "under coercion." The promises and confessions made by Coleson, who was free and controlled the life and death of the POWs, were "invalid." And the words stabbed into the bodies of the POWs who were knocked to the ground for resisting "screening" were valid and not made under duress!

This is the "fair and prudent screening" and "humane and fair plan" that the representatives of the US government spoke of at the conference table as "established and unchangeable." This is the "fait accompli" and excuse used by Washington to undermine the world's hope for a truce in Korea in order to plunge Korea into a greater war.

The Korean and Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate the inhumane, barbaric, and shameless act of the US imperialists in detaining POWs. We will fight to the end to uphold the principles of the Geneva Convention and for the right of POWs to return home and live peaceful lives!

### 美国侵略者强迫“甄别”巨济岛我被俘人员  证实美方破坏日内瓦公约  朝中人民绝不能容忍美方扣留战俘的行动

    美国侵略者强迫“甄别”巨济岛我被俘人员
    证实美方破坏日内瓦公约
    朝中人民绝不能容忍美方扣留战俘的行动
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：美国第八军宣布他们已完成强迫巨济岛上四万七千名战俘放弃回家权利的无耻勾当，此间认为这是最近美方为了继续和扩大朝鲜战争而采取的一连串挑衅行为中的一件。这种恶毒无耻的扣留战俘的勾当，开始于美方滥炸鸭绿江水力发电厂的那一天，而在哈利逊第三次逃离板门店帐篷的时候完成。
    大家知道，美方曾经毫无廉耻地假造了一个据称将予遣返的七万我方被俘人员的数字说这是什么“甄别”的结果。但是这件无耻之尤的事却引起了全世界人民的公愤和强烈的批评以致美方不得不通过他们的新闻记者，承认那七万数字是“马马虎虎”造出来的。
    这一次的无耻行为既遭受这样严重的打击，美方却还不肯死心。为了坚持扣留战俘，他们又来非法进行历时五天的“甄别”。这只有向全世界确凿地说明，美方公然破坏日内瓦公约，剥夺战俘要求回家的个人权利的罪恶居心，已经到了何等蛮横，何等恶劣的地步。
    美方强迫巨济岛上的战俘在死亡或不回家两者之间加以选择。但是战俘却进行了英勇的抵抗。美方更进一步调动了一师以上的武装齐全的军队，在英加军队的帮助下，把战俘强迫分成小组，以保证其“自愿遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘。
    波纳对战俘进行了无耻的恫吓。他把战俘发言人带到第七十六号营场——美方屠杀战俘的地点——去看已被焚化的抵抗甄别的战俘的尸体。战俘在被分散以后，就被剥去衣服，赶入铁房中，铁房中间有一个机关枪塔。当战俘拒绝走出去受“身分审查”和“按手印”时，美方就施放催泪瓦斯。战俘因唱歌而被枪毙。他们被断绝与外界的一切联系。他们在“密室”中受屠杀他们的刽子手盘问。
    这是敌视战俘的记者所报道的情况。而美国记者所没有报道的身受波纳“自愿遣返”的办法之害的战俘所报告的事实，远比上述情况更能说明问题。下面就是在一封上月从巨济岛暗暗送到北朝鲜的信上签名的六千二百二十三个朝鲜战俘的证词：
    五月十八日：波纳下令在扣留杜德的七十六号营场俘虏面前，把十三个战俘当众分尸。
    同日，波纳的军队杀死七十七号营场的战俘二十四名，并对四十六号营场的战俘说，一切愿意回朝鲜北部的战俘都应在下午七时以前到营场外面集合。所有战俘都跑出去了。结果却有一百二十七名战俘被机关枪和喷射火焰的坦克屠杀在地上。
    五月二十日与二十一日：有一千多战俘被命令到波纳的办公室报到，受“自愿遣返”的讯问。结果，有四百二十二名战俘永没有回到营场。有一百多名战俘回到营场时，臂膀被打断，满身刺刀伤，背上和胸上都被刺上字。
    五月二十二日与二十三日：波纳的军队攻击六○二号营场和七十三号营场。有八十八个战俘被机关枪和手榴弹打死。
    五月二十三日（发信的日子）：在七十六号营场，有四个战俘被砍去头颅，他们的头颅悬挂在树上。
    这仅仅是六天以内的事情。从敌视战俘的美国记者和受害的战俘提供的大量证据中，美国侵略军第八军总部却得出这样的结论：巨济岛四万七千名战俘的“甄别工作”在六月二十七日完成，未遇“阻碍”，也未发生“事件”！
    为了达到他们的不可告人的目的，五角大楼和克拉克又玩弄了一套离奇古怪的逻辑。他们想要世界相信，当时的巨济岛死亡营长官柯尔生所作的诺言和供状是“无效的”。为什么呢？因为这些诺言和供状是“在胁迫之下”作出的。逍遥自在、掌握战俘生死大权的柯尔生所作出的诺言与供状竟然是“无效的”。而那些因为抵抗“甄别”而被打倒在地上的战俘们身上所被刺的字样却是有效的，却不是在胁迫之下做出的！
    这就是美国政府的代表在会议桌上所说的“既定而不可改变”的“公平审慎的甄别”和“人道公平的方案”。这就是被华盛顿用来破坏世界人民对朝鲜停战谈判的希望，以便把朝鲜投入更大战火中的“既成事实”和藉口。
    朝中人民绝对不能容忍美帝国主义者这种绝灭人性的野蛮无耻的扣留战俘的行动，我们必将为了坚持日内瓦公约的原则的实现，为了战俘回家过和平生活的权利而斗争到底！
