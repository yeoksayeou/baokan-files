    Oppose Shoddy Comic Books
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters

    Recently, our newspaper has continuously received many letters from commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. They said that they received a large number of comic books and other publications from the people of the motherland at the front lines in Korea. Most of these picture books and publications vividly and specifically demonstrated the situation of the people of the motherland and the people of the world fighting for peace, which greatly encouraged their determination to fight for peace. However, some comic books were crudely made, and even had serious shortcomings and errors in content and image.

    Some comic books have lost their position in content, and they have made distorted portrayals of the people's revolutionary cause. For example, the comic book titled "The Love of a Korean Old Woman" published by Shanghai Tongkang Bookstore depicts a Korean woman who willingly endured the humiliation of the American aggressors in order to save her father. In the author's writing, the heroic Korean people became docile, weak, and lacking in courage and national integrity. The comic book titled "Accusation of Japanese Blood Letter" published by Shanghai Fuji Bookstore objectively depicts the criminal act of Japanese invaders raping Chinese women. These all show that the author's position is wrong. (Above letters from Dou Jizong and Chen Zhang, soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army)

    Some comic books have uglified the image of the people's army. The comic book titled "Combat Hero Guo Junqing" published by the Labor Publishing House depicts all the People's Liberation Army and combat hero Guo Junqing as short, ugly, grotesque, ignorant, and foolish. The comic book titled "Permanent Forward" published by Shanghai Xinghua Bookstore also paints the PLA soldiers very ugly. It can be seen that these authors still hold an old view to express the people's army, they think that the PLA soldiers are "roughnecks", are ugly people. They distorted the PLA and the heroic figures in the PLA. (Above letter from Zhang Naibo, a soldier of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army)

    Some comic book authors are seriously divorced from life and lack life experience. The comic book titled "Flying Across the 38th Parallel" published by the Central Bookstore and the comic book titled "People's Warrior" published by Wufeng Bookstore have both painted the uniforms of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army wrong. This shows that the author's creative attitude is not serious enough. (Above letters from Shan Xichun and Li Shuren, soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army)

    The above-mentioned are just a few examples of many bad comic books. Readers request certain comic book editors, illustrators, publishers, and distributors to correct their erroneous style and publish good comic books that are beneficial to the people.

    反对粗制滥造的连环画
    ——读者来信综述
    本报最近连续接到许多志愿军指战员的来信，他们说，他们在朝鲜前线，收到了大批祖国人民慰问他们的连环画和其他刊物。这些画册和刊物，绝大部分都生动地、具体地表现了祖国人民和全世界人民为和平而斗争的情况，很有力地鼓舞了他们为和平而战的决心。可是也有一部分连环画是粗制滥造的，甚至在内容上、形象上发生了严重的缺点和错误。
    有一种连环画在内容上是丧失了立场的，它们对于人民的革命事业作了歪曲的描绘。例如上海同康书局出版的题为“朝鲜老大娘的热爱”的连环画，描绘一个朝鲜妇女，为了解救自己的父亲甘心忍受美国侵略军的污辱。英勇的朝鲜人民在这个作者的笔下，成为驯服、软弱，毫无斗争勇气和民族气节的人。上海福记书局出版的题为“控诉日本血书”的连环画，把日本侵略者强奸中国妇女的罪恶行为，作以客观的描写。这些都说明作者的立场是错误的。（以上志愿军某部战士窦继宗、陈璋来信）
    有一种连环画丑化了人民军队的形象。劳动出版社出版的题为“战斗英雄郭俊卿”的连环画，把全体解放军和战斗英雄郭俊卿描绘成又矮又丑，奇形怪状，愚昧无知的样子。上海兴华书店出版的题为“永久前进”的连环画，也把解放军战士画得很丑。由此可见，这些作者仍然是抱着一种旧的观点来表现人民军队，他们认为解放军战士都是“大老粗”，都是丑陋不堪的人。他们歪曲了解放军和解放军中的英雄人物。（以上志愿军某部战士张乃波来信）
    有一些连环画的作者，严重地脱离生活和缺乏生活体验。中心书局出版的题为“飞越三八线”的连环画和五丰书局出版的题为“人民的战士”的连环画，都把中国人民志愿军的服装画错了。足见作者的创作态度是不够严肃的。（以上志愿军某部战士单锡纯、李树仁来信）
    上面所提到的，只是许多不好的连环画中的几个例子。读者要求某些连环画的编绘者、出版发行者，纠正错误的作风，出版好的、有益于人民的连环画。
