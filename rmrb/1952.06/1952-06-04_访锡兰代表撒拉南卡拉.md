    Visiting Ceylonese Representative Saranamkara
    At the southern tip of the Hindustan Peninsula, there is an island spanning six thousand square kilometers, inhabited by approximately seven million people who love peace and freedom. This is Ceylon. Ceylon has abundant gems, graphite, and dense rubber, tea, and coconut plantations, making it a wealthy place. The representative of the Ceylonese people attending the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is Saranamkara.
    Saranamkara is a director of the Ceylon Peace Congress and the first chairman of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation. In an interview with reporters, he spoke about the living conditions of the Ceylonese people in recent years. He said: After the end of World War II, the living conditions of the Ceylonese people have worsened. In 1948, the British government claimed to grant the Ceylonese people "independence" and "freedom," but these so-called "freedoms" did not change the lives of the Ceylonese people or their colonial servitude. The prices of food and daily necessities continue to rise, and many people suffer from unemployment, living in hunger or semi-hunger. Saranamkara cited several specific examples to illustrate the plight of the Ceylonese people. Due to severe unemployment, "the Ceylonese authorities conduct unemployment registration every three months and promise to find jobs for the unemployed in a short period. However, one worker registered twelve times without success and eventually committed suicide because he could not bear the burden of family life. Another young worker was forced to sell blood to the hospital multiple times to make a living because he could not find a job." Ceylon is a world-renowned rubber producer. In the past, Ceylon could freely sell rubber to countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. However, Saranamkara said painfully: "In the past two years, due to the United States prohibiting Ceylon from exporting rubber to the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, Ceylon's rubber exports have been greatly reduced, and prices have fallen, making the lives of the Ceylonese people more difficult, thus exacerbating unemployment." The Ceylonese people not only live in poverty but also in an atmosphere of war hysteria. The United States and Britain have established large naval and air bases in Ceylon. Ceylonese seaports have been used to dock foreign naval vessels, and Ceylonese airports have been used as air transport stations for foreign troops and military equipment. The Ceylonese people, like other peace-loving people in Asia, are threatened by war.
    However, the Ceylonese people have been actively engaged in the movement to defend peace since 1949. Broad sections of the people have enthusiastically participated in the struggle to defend peace. Ceylonese peace fighters have held three national congresses in support of peace. The first All-Ceylon Peace Congress, held in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, in January 1950, was attended by 2,000 representatives from all walks of life. At the end of December 1950, the second national congress in support of peace was held, attended by more than 1,500 representatives from all over the country. On the opening day of the Second Peace Congress, a demonstration in defense of peace was also held, with 50,000 participants. Three provinces in Ceylon have established branches of the National Peace Committee. Although peace advocates face many obstacles and persecutions in the country, the peace movement is still widely underway. Saranamkara said powerfully: "We have held congresses to support the just struggle of the Korean people and meetings to oppose the US imperialist embargo against China. On the issues of Egypt and Iran, we also held rallies to oppose imperialist conspiracies. We oppose the remilitarization of Japan and the separate peace treaty with Japan concluded in San Francisco. Now we are fighting against the establishment of military bases in Ceylon by US and British imperialists." The Ceylonese people have demonstrated their will to oppose war and defend peace with forceful actions. In the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign in 1950, a total of more than 500,000 people participated in the signing. The signature campaign calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact has collected the signatures of more than 250,000 people, and the signature campaign is still continuing. Ceylonese Buddhists are active participants in the peace movement, and they support the struggle to defend peace together with the peace-loving people of the country.
    In answering reporters' questions, Saranamkara talked about the importance of holding the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing. "The preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be held. Just as war instigators are preparing for war around the world, just as large-scale military bases are being built in Ceylon, just as the people of Malaya and Vietnamese patriots are being massacred by foreign aggressors, and just as US imperialists are conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, I believe that holding this regional peace conference at this time is of great significance to peace in Asia. Through this conference, the people of Asian countries can be united. Therefore, the people of Ceylon fully support the holding of this conference. We believe that other countries in Asia and progressive people around the world also support the holding of the peace conference in Beijing. This is the best answer to the imperialists and warmongers." Saranamkara finally added: "With the unity of the people of Asian countries, a new war in Asia can be prevented." (Li Yang)

    访锡兰代表撒拉南卡拉
    在印度斯坦半岛的南端，有一个面积达六千方公里的岛屿，居住着约七百万爱好和平与自由的人民。这就是锡兰。锡兰有着大量的宝石、石墨，生长着稠密的橡胶树、茶树和椰子林，是一块富庶的地方。代表锡兰人民出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的代表是撒拉南卡拉。
    撒拉南卡拉是锡兰和平大会理事，锡兰工会联合会第一届主席。他在接见记者时谈到了近几年来锡兰人民的生活情况。他说：第二次世界大战结束之后，锡兰人民的生活情况变得更加恶化了。一九四八年，英国政府说给锡兰人民以“独立”和“自由”，但是，这些所谓“自由”并没有改变锡兰人民的生活和殖民地奴役的状况。食物和日用必需品的价格不断上涨，许多人遭受到失业的苦痛，过着饥饿或半饥饿的生活。撒拉南卡拉举出几个具体的事例，来说明锡兰人民的困境。由于失业现象严重，“锡兰当局每隔三个月进行一次失业登记，并且诺许要在很短的时间内给失业者找到职业。但是，有一个工人登记了十二次还没有结果，最后由于不能肩负家庭生活的重担而自杀了。另外一个青年工人也因为找不到职业，被迫多次向医院卖血维持生活”。锡兰是世界闻名的橡胶出产地。过去，锡兰可以自由地把橡胶卖给亚洲、欧洲和美洲各国。但是，撒拉南卡拉沉痛地说：“近两年来，由于美国禁止锡兰把橡胶输往苏联、中国和各人民民主国家，锡兰的橡胶出口大大削减，价格下跌了，锡兰人民的生活更加困难，因而失业现象更加严重了。”锡兰人民不仅生活在穷困当中，而且也生活在战争歇斯底里的气氛中。美国和英国在锡兰建立了广大的海空军基地。锡兰的海港已经用来停泊外国的海军船只，锡兰的机场已经用作运送外国军队和军事装备的空运站。锡兰人民正如亚洲其他国家的爱好和平人民一样，受到了战争的威胁。
    然而，锡兰人民从一九四九年开始就积极开展保卫和平的运动。广大的各阶层人民都热烈地参加保卫和平的斗争。锡兰的和平战士已经举行了三次全国拥护和平大会。一九五○年一月在锡兰首府可伦坡召开的第一次全锡兰拥护和平大会，就有各阶层人民的二千名代表出席。一九五○年十二月末，又举行了第二次全国拥护和平大会，到会的有来自全国各地的一千五百多位代表。在第二次拥护和平大会开幕的当天，还举行了一次保卫和平的示威游行，参加者有五万人。锡兰已经有三个省成立了全国和平委员会的分会。虽然和平拥护者在国内受到多方阻难和迫害，但是，和平运动仍在广泛地进行着。撒拉南卡拉有力地说：“我们曾经召开过支援朝鲜人民正义斗争的大会，举行过反对美国帝国主义对中国实施禁运的会议。在埃及和伊朗的问题上，我们也集会反对帝国主义的阴谋活动。我们反对日本的重新军国主义化，反对在旧金山缔结的单独对日和约。现在我们正在为反对美、英帝国主义者在锡兰建立军事基地而斗争。”锡兰人民已经用有力的行动来表现他们反对战争、保卫和平的意志。在一九五○年斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动中，总计有五十万以上的人民参加了签名。要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，已经征集了二十五万以上的人民的签名，签名运动仍在继续展开中。锡兰的佛教徒是和平运动的积极参加者，他们和全国爱好和平的人民一道支持保卫和平的斗争。
    撒拉南卡拉在回答记者的问题时，谈到了在北京召开亚洲和太平洋区域和平会议的重要性。“亚洲和太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议就要召开了。正当战争挑拨者在世界各地准备战争，正当大规模的军事基地在锡兰建筑，正当马来亚人民和越南爱国者遭受外国侵略者屠杀，而且正当美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的时候，我认为在这个时候召开这个地区的和平会议，对于亚洲和平是有着极大的意义的。通过这个会议可以把亚洲各国人民团结起来。因此，锡兰人民全力支持这个会议的召开。我们相信：亚洲其他国家和全世界的进步人类也同样支持在北京召开和平会议。这是给帝国主义者和好战分子的最好的回答。”撒拉南卡拉最后又补充说一句：“有了亚洲各国人民的团结，就可以阻止新的战争在亚洲发生。”（李洋）
