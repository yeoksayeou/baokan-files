    The Hui People Can Happily Celebrate Their Festivals
    Comrade Editor: The fifth month of the lunar calendar is the "Ramadan" for the Hui people. After the "Ramadan" is over, it is the "Eid al-Fitr." On this day, the Hui compatriots are as happy as the Han compatriots celebrating the New Year. They put on festive costumes and eat the most exquisite food of their ethnic group; they entertain relatives and friends, pay respects to each other; or invite Ahongs to chant scriptures, or go to mosques to pray. Before liberation, the Hui compatriots hoped to celebrate the festival in this way, but it was impossible. Under the rule of the reactionaries, the Hui people or other minority ethnic groups not only lived in extreme poverty, but also their religious beliefs and customs were restricted and insulted. Since liberation, the people of all ethnic groups have been liberated politically and economically, and their religious beliefs and customs have gained freedom. The wish of the Hui people to celebrate "Eid al-Fitr" has been realized. An old Hui man in Niujie, District 8, Beijing, said: "Now when we talk to our brotherly ethnic groups about the 'Ramadan,' we are no longer discriminated against or insulted as in the past, but are respected." The Hui people fully support the People's Government's order that all government offices give Hui cadres a day off on the Hui's "Eid al-Fitr." They said: "In the past, we would not have dared to imagine such a thing. Only the People's Government, only Chairman Mao, would take such care of our minority ethnic groups."

### 回族人民可以欢度自己的节日了

    回族人民可以欢度自己的节日了
    编辑同志：阴历五月，是回族人民的“斋月”。在“斋月”期满之后，便是“开斋节”。在“开斋节”这一天，回族同胞像汉族同胞过新年一样地欢乐。他们穿上过节的盛装，吃本民族最讲究的食品；招待亲友，互相拜节；或请阿訇诵经，或到清真寺去做礼拜。解放以前，回族同胞是希望这样过节的，但是不可能。在反动派统治之下，回族或其他少数民族不但生活特别困苦，而且宗教信仰、风俗习惯也是受到限制和侮辱的。解放以来，各族人民在政治上、生活上翻身了，宗教信仰、风俗习惯都得了自由。回族人民欢度“开斋节”的愿望实现了。北京市八区牛街的一位回族老人说：“现在我们和兄弟民族谈到‘斋月’的事，再也不像过去那样地受到歧视、侮辱了，而是受到尊重。”回族人民对人民政府通令各机关在回民的“开斋节”对回族干部放假一天的措施，十分拥护。他们说：“过去，我们不敢想会有这样的事。只有人民政府，只有毛主席，才会这样地照顾我们少数民族。”
