Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th: The new Supreme Commander of the American North Atlantic Aggression Forces, "Bacteriological Warfare General" Ridgway, arrived in Rome on the 16th. This event enraged the Italian people, who took resolute action to express their opposition to the American occupiers and to defend peace.

    Several days before Ridgway's arrival, the Gasperi government repeatedly stated that it would do everything possible to stop all protest demonstrations against Ridgway. They were so frightened that they hurriedly transferred tens of thousands of military police from all over the country to defend Rome, turning this famous cultural city into a military camp. Rome was full of police cars running back and forth and military police, police, and plainclothes agents patrolling, arbitrarily arresting any citizens deemed "suspicious." In cities in the provinces, the police also carried out large-scale arrests. Many peace supporters were arrested in Florence, Bari, and Tuscany (Viterbo province). Italy was filled with the fascist atmosphere of the Mussolini era.

    The response of the Roman people and all the Italian people to this provocative action and police rule was to unswervingly strengthen the struggle. On June 12, the Rome Peace Committee held an enlarged meeting despite the authorities' ban. Representatives from various trade unions in Rome and many well-known figures in the scientific and cultural circles attended the meeting. They resolved to call on the people of Rome to make their city the "capital of the struggle for peace." On the eve of Ridgway's arrival, vigorous protest movements were launched from Milan to Palermo and from Venice to Sardinia. Mass protest rallies were held in Genoa, Naples, Milan, Bologna, Modena, Ancona, Pisa, and dozens of other towns. In Rome, spontaneous gatherings were held everywhere to protest Ridgway's visit to Italy, to oppose the military treaty signed with the Bonn-Adenauer government, and to oppose the preparation for a new war in Europe. Peace fighters in various districts of Rome raised colorful peace flags on tall buildings everywhere. Tens of thousands of leaflets exposing the true face of the American occupiers were also distributed throughout the city. Slogans such as "Drive out the Plague General!" "Our country does not need foreign generals!" "Stop bacteriological warfare!" and "Long live Italian independence!" appeared everywhere on the streets of Rome. The police panicked and arrested people writing slogans and tried their best to erase the slogans, but new slogans appeared in the blink of an eye.

    On the day of Ridgway's arrival, the Italian government exceptionally mobilized 50,000 military police to be on alert throughout the city. The 15-kilometer road from the airport to the center of Rome was lined with military police holding carbines. A large number of motorized units were gathered around government agencies and the American embassy. Armed guards on motorcycles escorted Ridgway from the airport to his residence. The weak Italian rulers thus welcomed their master with fear and anxiety.

    In order to prevent people's demonstrations, the Gasperi government mobilized 30,000 fully armed military police in the downtown area of Rome alone. However, all the curfew measures could not stop the Roman people from protesting Ridgway's arrival. On the afternoon of Ridgway's arrival, protest demonstrations were held everywhere in Rome. Teams of demonstrators held up signs and banners, and gathered in five locations within the city. Before the police could gather in the southern districts of the city, some of the demonstrators had already crossed police posts and barricades and marched towards the city center. The police dispersed the demonstrators at the intersections leading to the city center, but at the same time several surprise demonstrations occurred in other areas of the city center. Along with the protest demonstrations, workers in various industrial sectors, a slaughterhouse, a milk factory, and most construction sites in Rome held a one-and-a-half to two-hour strike. Short peace gatherings were held throughout the city, and gatherings were also held in various factories.

    On the 16th, countless strikes and gatherings also took place in other cities across Italy. People everywhere raised slogans calling for peace and Italian independence, and protested Ridgway's arrival. In Milan, Turin, Genoa, Bologna, Livorno, Florence, Terni, Naples, and other cities, every major factory and enterprise held rallies and passed resolutions protesting the arrival of this bacteriological warfare general in Italy. Strikes of three or four hours were held throughout northern Italy. Although the government mobilized all police forces to deal with peace fighters, rallies were still held everywhere, and tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed everywhere. In Livorno, near the American military base, in Ancona, and in many other cities, flags of peace supporters were flying on many houses.

    People from all walks of life in Italy, from workers in Milan to professors and lecturers at the University of Rome, and students in Naples, have all unanimously issued calls to protest Ridgway's arrival in Italy.

    全意大利人民抗议瘟疫将军李奇微赴意
    【新华社十八日讯】罗马消息：新任北大西洋侵
    略军的美国总司令、“细菌战将军”李奇微，于十
    六日到达罗马。这件事激怒了意大利人民。他们采
    取了坚决的行动来表达他们反对美国占领者和保卫
    和平的意志。
    早在李奇微到达前好几天，加斯贝利政府就一再表示要全力制止一切反对李奇微的抗议示威运动。他们胆战心惊到这样的程度，竟急急忙忙从全国各地抽调了好几万名军警到罗马防守，把这个文化名城变成了一座军营。罗马到处都是络绎奔驰的警车和往来巡逻的宪兵、警察和便衣特务，他们任意逮捕一切被目为“形迹可疑”的市民。在外省的城市里，警察也大批进行逮捕，佛罗伦萨、巴利、突斯坎尼（威特波省）都有许多和平拥护者被捕。意大利充满了墨索里尼时代的法西斯恐怖气氛。
    罗马人民和全意大利人民对于这种挑衅行动和警察统治的答复是：不屈不挠地加强斗争。六月十二日，罗马和平委员会不顾当局的禁令，举行了扩大会议，罗马各工会的代表以及科学界、文化界的许多知名人士出席了这个会议，他们决议号召罗马人民使他们的城市成为“争取和平斗争的首都”。在李奇微到达的前夕，从米兰到巴勒摩，从威尼斯到撒丁岛，都展开了蓬蓬勃勃的抗议运动。在热那亚、那不勒斯、米兰、波伦亚、摩登纳、安科纳、比萨和其他几十个市镇，人民都举行了群众抗议大会。在罗马，到处都举行自发性的集会，抗议李奇微来意大利，反对与波恩西德政府签订的军事性条约，反对在欧洲准备新战争。罗马各区的和平战士们在各处高楼大厦上升起了彩色的和平旗帜。全城还散发了几万张揭露美国占领者真面目的传单。罗马街道上到处都出现了这样的标语：“把瘟疫将军赶出去！”“我们国家里不需要外国将军！”“停止细菌战争！”“意大利独立万岁！”警察们张皇失措地逮捕写标语的人，并且费尽力气来擦掉标语，但是一转眼又出现了新标语。
    在李奇微到达的那一天，意大利政府破例出动了五万名军警在全城戒备，从飞机场到罗马市中心的十五公里道路上，沿途排满了手执卡宾枪的军警。在政府机关和美国大使馆周围更集结了大批摩托化部队。骑着机器脚踏车的武装警卫一直把李奇微从机场护送到住所。孱弱的意大利统治者就是这样恐惧不安地来欢迎他们的主子的。
    为了防止人民的示威运动，加斯贝利政府仅仅在罗马市中心区就调集了三万名全副武装的军警。但是，一切戒严的措施都不能阻止罗马人民抗议李奇微的到达。就在李奇微到达后的下午，罗马城内到处举行了抗议示威，一队队的示威者高举着标语牌和大旗，同时在城内五个地点集合了起来。警察还来不及在南城各区集结，一部分示威队伍就已经越过了警察岗哨和警戒线，向市中心进发。警察在通往市中心的街口驱散示威者，但是同时在市中心另外若干地区又发生了好几起突击性的示威。和抗议示威同时，罗马各工业部门、一家屠宰场、一家牛奶场和大多数建筑工地的劳动人民举行了一个半小时到两小时的罢工。全市各地举行了简短的和平集会，各工厂里也举行了集会。
    意大利全国其他各城市，十六日也发生无数次罢工和集会，各地人民提出了争取和平、争取意大利独立的口号，抗议李奇微到达。在米兰、都灵、热那亚、波伦亚、里窝那、佛罗伦萨、特尔尼、那不勒斯和其他城市，每一个比较大的工厂企业都举行了大会，通过决议，抗议这位细菌战将军抵达意大利。在北意各地举行了三四个钟头的罢工。虽然政府动员了一切警察部队，去对付和平战士，但各地仍然纷纷举行集会，成千上万的传单到处散发。在美国军事基地附近的里窝那，在安科纳以及其他城市许多房子上，都飘扬着和平拥护者的旗帜。
    意大利各阶层人民，从米兰的工人到罗马大学的教授、讲师，和那不勒斯的学生，都一致发出了抗议李奇微来到意大利的呼声。
