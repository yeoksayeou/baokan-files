    Suggest Vigorously Promoting the "Vacuum Formwork Method"
    Comrade Editor: The Soviet Union's advanced experience in pouring cement—the "vacuum formwork method"—has now been successfully tested by the Northeast Electric Power Administration. It is said that using this method not only saves on the formwork materials needed for pouring cement, but also allows the cement to dry quickly and ensures its strength. A few days ago, I saw a news report about a certain water conservancy project that was rushing to pour cement overnight as soon as the weather cleared after days of rain. This spirit is admirable. However, I think that if some of our water conservancy projects adopted this "vacuum formwork method," it would solve those difficulties. Therefore, I suggest that large water conservancy projects such as the Huai River project promote this advanced experience.

    建议大力推广“真空型板法”
    编辑同志：苏联灌浇洋灰的先进经验——“真空型板法”，现在东北电业管理局已试用成功。据说采用这个办法，不但可节省浇洋灰所需的型板材料，而且能使洋灰很快地干燥并保证坚固。前几天，我看到报纸上登载的某处水利工程，连日遇雨，等到天一晴，就漏夜赶浇洋灰工程，这种精神是值得佩服的。但我想我国某些水利工程，如果采用这种“真空型板法”，一定会解决那些困难。因此，我建议淮河等大的水利工程，推广这种先进经验。
