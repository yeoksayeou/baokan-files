To the Editors: During the reactionary rule, I was a hired laborer, working for the landlords year-round, living a life of hunger and cold, worse than that of animals. After "August 15th" [end of WWII], under the leadership of the People's Government, I was emancipated, and I was allocated land, houses, and livestock, guaranteeing my production and life. At that time, I felt indescribable gratitude and excitement. Since then, I have responded to the call of the People's Government to develop production, organized myself, and worked hard to improve my life and to build a new China and strive for a better future.

In 1947, our mutual aid team was organized in the form of "exchanging plows and labor." At that time, the team's strength was very weak, with only four thin horses, a broken cart, and a patchwork of old-fashioned farm tools. In this way, it was very difficult to cultivate all 21 hectares of land for the whole team. But under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, I did not give in. I tried my best to patiently inspire the team members' enthusiasm for production and overcome difficulties.

By 1950, the mutual aid team's productivity had gradually increased, and the living standards of the team members also improved accordingly. The mutual aid team had transformed from a small-scale team engaged solely in agricultural production into a large-scale mutual aid and cooperation team that combined agriculture and sideline production, with year-round mutual assistance and cooperation, and division of labor and specialization. The whole team consisted of ten households, with 31.5 hectares of cultivated land, seven strong horses, a new cart, eight full laborers, two half laborers, and four women participating in production. The production enthusiasm of all team members was extremely high, and everyone exerted their initiative and creativity, improved farming methods, and finally achieved successful experiences such as "autumn plowing," "dense sowing," and "deep plowing and meticulous cultivation" in 1951. Therefore, last year, the average yield of wheat per hectare in our entire team increased to 5,541 catties. My own five or six mu of wheat created the highest record of wheat production in the whole county. I was therefore honorably elected as a first-class labor model in the province and received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government.

Our mutual aid team is constantly growing, productivity is constantly improving, and agricultural technology is constantly being improved; all these achievements are inseparable from the leadership and cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Government. We are determined to make even greater efforts to create a new record of higher yields this year to repay the honor given to us by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    全国丰产模范蓝国焕来信：
    报告提高耕作技术、争取今年丰收的决心
    编辑同志：在反动派统治时期，我是一个雇工，整年替地主干活，过着饥寒交迫、牛马不如的生活。“八一五”以后，我在人民政府的领导下翻了身，分得了土地、房屋和牛马，生产、生活都有了保障。这时我心里有说不出来的感激和兴奋。从此，我响应人民政府发展生产的号召，组织起来，为改善自己的生活，为建设新中国、争取美好的将来而努力。
    一九四七年，我们互助组以“插犋换工”的形式组织起来了。当时小组力量非常薄弱，只有四匹瘦马，一台破车，一套七拚八凑的旧式农具。这样，要耕作全组二十一垧土地是非常困难的。但在党和人民政府的领导下，我没有低头。我想尽办法耐心地启发组员们的生产热情，战胜了困难。
    到一九五○年，互助组生产力逐渐提高，组员们的生活水平亦随着改善。互助组已由单纯进行农业生产的小型组转变为农副业结合的、常年互助合作的，分工分业的大型互助组。全组共十户，有耕地三十一垧五亩、壮马七匹、新车一台、整劳动力八名、半劳动力两名、妇女参加生产的四名。全体组员的生产热情无比高涨，大家发挥了积极性和创造性，改进了耕作方法，终于在一九五一年取得了“秋翻地”“密播撒种”“深耕细作”等成功经验。因此，去年我们全组小麦平均每垧产量提高到五、五四一斤。我自己的五六亩小麦，就创造了全县小麦最高的丰产纪录。我因此光荣地当选为省一等劳动模范，并得到中央人民政府农业部的奖励。
    我们互助组不断壮大，生产力不断提高，农业技术不断改进；所有这些成绩，和共产党、人民政府的领导与培养是分不开的。我们决以更大的努力在本年创造出更高的丰产新纪录，回答毛主席、共产党给我们的荣誉。
