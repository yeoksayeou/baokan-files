    Avenge the Children Killed by American Aggressors
    Editor: After reading the article "The Children's Accusation" written by Cao Ming in the People's Daily on June 5th, I felt indescribably sad and indignant.
    The Wall Street germ warfare criminals in the United States are so inhumane as to use weapons that kill without shedding blood to murder our younger sisters and brothers. When twelve-year-old Bao Lijun talked about how her younger sister Lirong was killed by American germs, every word pierced my heart, as if my own sister had been harmed. I thought of my younger sisters and brothers, I thought of thousands of Lijuns and Lirongs. How innocent and lively they were, how happily they went to school every day, how much they enjoyed playing. The motherland is carrying out large-scale construction for them, and they are growing up healthily. But today, this beautiful scene, these flowers, are threatened by the germs spread by the American aggressors!
    Comrade Cao Ming said: "Which parents do not have lovely children? Which men and women do not have siblings?" Yes, today Lijun and Lirong are being devastated, and tomorrow it may happen to more Lijuns and Lirongs. A common will is calling to us, calling to the people of China and the world, let us unite and denounce the heinous crimes of the American Wall Street germ warfare criminals.
    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. I will polish my weapons and be ready to fight at any time to defend our younger sisters and brothers. Ning Jizhi

    为被美国侵略者杀害的孩子们报仇
    编辑同志：读了六月五日人民日报所载草明写的“孩子的控诉”一文，我心中有说不出来的难过和愤恨。
    美国华尔街的细菌战犯们，竟这样灭绝人性地用杀人不见血的武器，来杀害我们的妹妹和弟弟。十二岁的鲍丽君谈到她妹妹丽蓉被美国细菌害死的情形，一字一句都刺进了我的心坎，如同我的妹妹被害一样。我想起了我的妹妹和弟弟，我想起了千万个丽君、丽蓉。他们是多么的天真活泼，他们每天快乐地去上学，他们在尽情地游戏。祖国为他们进行大规模的建设，他们健壮地成长着。可是，这美景，这花朵，今天竟受到了美国侵略者撒放的细菌的威胁！
    草明同志说：“那一个父母没有可爱的儿女？那一个男女没有兄弟姊妹？”是的，今天丽君、丽蓉受到了摧残，明天也可能临到更多的丽君、丽蓉的头上。一种共同的意志在呼唤着我们，呼唤着全中国、全世界的人民，让我们团结起来，声讨美国华尔街细菌战犯的万恶罪行。
    我是一个人民解放军战士。我要擦亮我的武器，随时准备着为保卫我们的妹妹和弟弟而战斗。宁积志
