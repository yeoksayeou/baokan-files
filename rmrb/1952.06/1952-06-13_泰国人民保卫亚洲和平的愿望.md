    The vast majority of Siamese people are Buddhist. Buddhism teaches people, "NATTHI SANTI PRAMASUKHA," which means "There is no happiness greater than peace." Siamese people are people with this belief. They need true peace, where the various language-speaking peoples of Asia and the Pacific region can coexist peacefully; they do not need a disguised peace—one human group ruling over another. Siamese people call themselves "Thai" because, in our language, "Thai" means "free," not "slave." Therefore, the peace that Siamese people need is the "freedom" of mankind, not a slave-like peace.

    The Siamese people are gradually awakening, realizing that the "Thai" they thought they were, existed only in name. In reality, the Siamese people are ruled and exploited like slaves by British and American imperialism and their lackeys. The Siamese people see that many Asian friends are in the same environment as themselves; they also see that imperialism is carrying out aggression against countries in Asia and the Pacific region, such as in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines; they also see that peace in Asia and the Pacific region is being destroyed. U.S. imperialism is expanding the military power and armed forces of Japanese fascism, while interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, forcing other countries to establish military bases for the United States, sending troops to invade everywhere, and arbitrarily seizing grain and raw materials. U.S. imperialism is promoting world war, attempting to obstruct the people's movement to defend peace. In short, imperialism is carrying out aggression against countries in Asia and the Pacific region and oppressing the people into slavery. Therefore, the Siamese people have the following aspirations:

    1. Stop the wars of aggression in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other places, and deal with the wars in a peaceful and just manner;

    2. Stop the rearmament of Japanese fascism, and demand that negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan be conducted based on true democratic principles and the common agreement of all countries. Not allow the expansion of armed forces to the point of threatening the security of neighboring countries. Promptly withdraw foreign troops from Japan. Let the Japanese people develop their economy, politics, and culture under democratic principles, and cooperate closely with other countries;

    3. Withdraw foreign troops from all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, prohibit interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and respect each other's territorial sovereignty;

    4. Stop destructive atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons, as well as other weapons that cause massive destruction of life and property;

    5. Stop war propaganda; stop preparing war strength for war;

    6. Countries should conduct trade and exchange culture with each other on the basis of fair principles. Prohibit blockades and obstruction of trade relations and mutual exchanges.

    My hopes for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference:

    The Siamese people know that true peace must be obtained through real struggle. They understand that their own strength is very small, and it seems impossible to realize this hope by fighting alone. It is necessary to cooperate with the people and peace fighters of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the people of the United States and the people of Japan.

    The Siamese people see that the people of the Soviet Union, the people of China, the people of Korea, the people of Vietnam, etc., are carrying out arduous struggles for peace and achieving good results, which they consider to be our example.

    On June 6th, the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has closed. This signifies the success of the meeting and represents the initial victory of cooperation between the various countries and nations in this region of the world. We have exchanged opinions, consulted with each other, and jointly drafted a declaration. If peace fighters of all nations and languages cooperate and help each other in practice, and not just in words, the Siamese people believe that the success of future meetings will be even greater.

    The Siamese people will support the resolutions of this conference in action, in words, and in thought. Because we know that our own victory can only be obtained on the basis of mutual help and mutual cooperation both domestically and between countries.

    I firmly believe that peace will triumph!

    泰国人民保卫亚洲和平的愿望
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议泰国代表  ?沙愿·都拉叻
    绝大部分的暹罗人民是信仰佛教的。佛教如此教训人们：“NATTHI SANTI PRAMASUKHA”，即是“没有什么幸福比和平幸福”。暹罗人民是有这种信仰的人民。他们需要真正的和平，就是亚洲和太平洋区域说着各种语言的民族应该和平共居；他们不需要伪装的和平——一个人类集团统治另一个人类集团。暹罗人民所以自称为“泰”，就是因为用我们的文字来说，“泰”就是“自由”，并非是“奴隶”。因此暹罗人民所需要的和平，是人类的“自由”，不是奴隶式的和平。
    暹罗人民渐渐觉悟了，他们认为向来自以为是的“泰”，只是名义上的存在。实际上，暹罗人民像奴隶似的被英美帝国主义及其走狗所统治和剥削。暹罗人民看见很多亚洲的朋友们和他们自己一样处在同一种环境中；他们也看见帝国主义对亚洲和太平洋区域各国正进行着侵略，例如在朝鲜、在越南、在马来亚、在菲律宾等地；他们又看见，亚洲和太平洋区域的和平正在被毁灭。美帝国主义正在扩张日本法西斯的军事力量和武装力量，同时进行干涉他国的内政，逼迫其他国家为美国建立军事根据地，派军队到处进行侵略，任意抢收粮食和原料。美帝国主义宣传世界大战，企图阻挠人民保卫和平运动。总而言之，帝国主义对亚洲和太平洋区域各国进行侵略，并压迫人民为奴隶。因此，暹罗人民有下列的愿望：
    1、制止朝鲜、越南、马来亚等地的侵略战争，用和平和公正的方式来处理战争；
    2、制止重新武装日本法西斯，要求根据真正的民主原则和各国的共同协议，进行对日和约谈判。不许可扩张武装力量以致威胁邻国安全。迅速地撤退在日本的外国军队。日本人民在民主原则下，发展经济、政治和文化，并与其他国家紧密地合作；
    3、撤退在亚洲和太平洋区域各国的外国军队，不准干涉其他国家内政，互相尊重领土主权；
    4、制止毁灭性的原子弹和细菌武器以及其他大量破坏生命和财产的武器；
    5、制止战争宣传；制止为战争而准备战争实力；
    6、各国之间，应该在公平的原则之下，互相进行贸易，互相交流文化。禁止封锁和阻碍贸易关系和互相来往。
    我对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的希望：
    暹罗各民族知道，真正的和平是必需经过真正的斗争才能得到的。他们明白自己的力量是很小的，独自进行斗争，似乎不可能实现这一希望，必须与亚洲和太平洋区域各国的人民与和平战士合作，包括和美国人民、日本人民的合作在内。
    暹罗人民看到苏联人民、中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民等为着和平而进行艰巨的斗争，获得很好的效果，认为是我们的榜样。
    六月六日，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议已经闭幕了。这表示会议的成功，并表示在世界上这一个区域的各国家、各民族之间合作的初步胜利。我们已经互相交换了意见，互相协商，共同起草宣言。如果各民族、各种语言的和平战士们，在实践上互相合作，互相帮助，而不是只是口头上的话，暹罗人民认为未来的会议的成功会是更伟大的。
    暹罗人民要从行动上、语言上、思想上拥护此次会议的决议案。因为我们知道，自己的胜利是只有在国内和各国之间的互相帮助和互相合作的基础上才能得到的。
    我坚信和平必将取得胜利！
