	The second issue of the "Film Festival News" issued by Czechoslovakia states: "At the present time, when a sharp struggle is being waged to consolidate world peace and stop the heinous plans to provoke a new war, progressive filmmakers from all over the world are preparing to gather at the International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia to express their firm determination to participate in the ranks of hundreds of millions of working people. They will join the working people of the world in demanding an end to the germ warfare being waged in Korea, and opposing the shameful 'General Treaty,' as well as protesting against the persecution of the progressive forces of the people in France and other capitalist countries."
