Teaching Speech on the Rapid Literacy Method
Fifth Lecture: Rushing Through New Characters, First Aiming to Read (Part 2)
In the fourth lecture, we discussed how to "explain" new characters when rushing through them, and how to manage the progress of rushing through new characters. Now, let's talk about other issues to pay attention to when rushing through new characters:

Rushing through new characters and abandoning phonetic symbols (what soldiers call "dropping the crutch") should not be treated as two separate teaching steps. Some units only require students to be able to spell and explain during the new character blitz, and only after blitzing more than two thousand new characters do they require students to be able to read characters without phonetic symbols. As a result, in the early stage of the entire new character blitz, students lack opportunities to grasp the character shapes, which is effectively just practicing pinyin. Therefore, when all the new characters have been blitzed and the "crutch" is dropped, most students have forgotten how to explain the characters, and they have to start the blitz all over again, prolonging the teaching time. The correct method is: once pinyin has been learned and the teaching focus has shifted to rushing through new characters, teachers and instructors must encourage students to look at the character shapes more, repeatedly review them, and not only achieve being able to spell and explain, but also being able to read the characters without phonetic symbols. To achieve this goal, first, appropriately increase the review time. Take a staged review approach during the blitz, generally with forty or fifty characters per stage. Second, start rushing through new characters after students have a solid foundation in pinyin. If pinyin is not well mastered, do not rush through new characters. In teaching, if the teacher simply emphasizes pinyin, students will "cling to pinyin and refuse to let go," neglecting to memorize the characters. If they simply emphasize memorizing characters, students will "simply abandon pinyin and memorize the characters by rote," making some figurative marks next to the characters (what soldiers call "dirt crutches"): such as drawing a string of abacus beads next to the character "盘" (pán, plate), and drawing a needle next to the character "针" (zhēn, needle). Over time, they will read "盘" (pán) as "串" (chuàn, string) and "针" (zhēn) as "棍" (gùn, stick). This is a very stupid method and does not meet the requirements of the rapid literacy method.

Now, let's talk about how to organize review and testing. In order to understand the students' learning situation and check the teaching effectiveness at any time, general teaching units conduct tests once a day. In terms of testing methods, one method is to organize many teachers and instructors to conduct a universal test every night. This method often makes students feel a lot of pressure, and they are very nervous during the test. It wastes time and does not yield accurate test results. Another method is to combine review and testing. During the review, students can put a dot next to the characters they can spell and explain, and circle the characters they can read without phonetic symbols. Before class, each person can count how many circles and dots they have, and then the mutual aid group can randomly test a portion of the students. This way, the test results are not only accurate, but also time-saving. At the same time, distinguishing the new characters during the review allows students to concentrate on reviewing the new characters more. Of course, to do this, it is necessary to fully mobilize and prevent some students from underreporting or overreporting.

When rushing through new characters halfway through, a major review can be conducted (or called an intermediate review). The purpose of the major review is to thoroughly digest the learned characters through review, further consolidate them, and allow students who have "fallen behind" during the blitz to catch up with the progress. The review method is the same as the general review mentioned below. When reviewing, students should be told that they must not think they can "take a breath" and develop a relaxed attitude. At the same time, teachers should organize students with good grades to help students with poor grades.

After rushing through all the new characters, you must take three to five days to conduct a general review and test, to help students consolidate the characters they have learned and lay the foundation for the "reading and writing" that is about to begin.

Before the general review begins, students often develop some incorrect understandings, such as some feeling that there is no need to review because they are complacent; others thinking, "Now that the new character blitz is over, can we take a breather!" In response to these thoughts, mobilization work should be done before the general review to explain that the general review is to eliminate "troublesome characters" (that is, characters that are difficult to remember) in order to better conduct reading and writing. The method is to review and test section by section from back to front. The number of characters to review each time can be determined according to the different levels of the students. During the review, you should pay attention to: first, avoid non-focused review, and do not mark difficult-to-remember characters; second, pay attention to the character shapes, so as not to confuse characters with the same or slightly different shapes; third, practice mutual assistance, and oppose the phenomenon of only caring about oneself and not caring about others. Therefore, teachers must not slack off in the slightest during the review, and must deeply and specifically help and guide students, so as to smoothly unfold the next step - reading and writing.

    速成识字法教学讲话
    第五讲  突击生字，先求会读（下）
    在第四讲中，我们讲了突击生字时如何“讲”生字，和如何掌握突击生字的进度问题。现在我们再讲一讲突击生字时还应该注意些什么问题：
    突击生字和撇开注音符号（战士们称为“丢拐棍”）来记生字，不能当成两个教学步骤。有些单位，在突击生字阶段，只要求会拼、会讲，等突击完了两千多个生字以后，再要求能脱离注音符号念生字；结果，在整个突击生字的前一阶段，由于学员缺乏捉摸字形的机会，实际上等于只练习了拼音。因此，到全部生字突击完了，一丢开“拐棍”，大部分学员已把生字的讲法忘记完了，只好重新开始突击，延长了教学时间。正确的方法是：当拼音已经学会，教学重点已经转到突击生字的时候，教员和辅导员就必须启发学员多看字形，反复地进行复习，不仅要达到会拼、会讲，还要达到能脱离注音符号念字。为了达到这个目的，第一，要适当地增加复习时间，突击中要采取分段复习的办法，每段一般以四、五十个字为宜；第二，学员在拼音方面有了相当基础之后，再开始突击生字，如果拼音还掌握不好，就不要突击生字。在教学中，教员如果单纯强调了拼音，学员就会“死抓住拼音不放手”，忽略了记生字。如果单纯强调了记字，学员就会“干脆不要拼音，死记生字”，他们在字的旁边做一些形象的记号（战士们称为“土拐棍”）：如在“盘”字边上划一串算盘珠子，在“针”字旁边划上一根针；时间久了，就会把“盘”字念成“串”字；把“针”字念成“棍”字。这是一种非常笨的办法，不合乎速成识字法的要求。
    现在，我们再来谈谈怎样组织复习和测验。为了随时了解学员的学习情况，检查教学效果，一般的教学单位，都是每天测验一次。在测验的方法上，有一种是组织很多的教员和辅导员，每晚来一次普遍测验。这种方法往往使学员感到压力很大，测验时精神非常紧张；它既耽误时间，又得不到准确的测验成绩。另一种方法是把复习和测验结合起来，在复习中，可以叫学员在能拼能讲的字旁边划上点儿；在脱离了注音符号能读的字边上划上圈儿，下课前由每人统计一下有多少圈、点，再经互助组抽测一部分学员就行了。这样测验成绩不仅准确，而且时间也经济。同时，在复习中，把生字区别开来，使学员能集中精力多复习生字。当然这样做，要做好充分的动员，防止有的学员以少报多，或以多报少的偏向。
    突击生字进行到中途时，可以进行一次大的复习
    （或称中间复习）。大复习的目的是要通过复习使学员将学过的生字彻底加以消化，进一步把它巩固起来，并使在突击中“掉队”的学员赶上进度。复习的方法和下面讲到的总复习相同。复习时要向学员说明，切不可认为可以“松口气”而产生松懈思想；同时教员要把成绩好的学员组织起来，帮助成绩差的学员。
    突击完了全部生字以后，必须抽出三几天的时间进行总复习和测验，帮助学员巩固已认识的字，为就要开始的“阅读、写话”打下基础。
    总复习开始前，学员往往要产生一些不正确的认识，如有的因为自满而感到没有复习的必要；有的认为“生字突击完了，可松一口气了吧！”。针对这些思想情况，总复习之前，应作好动员工作，说明总复习是为了消灭“捣蛋字”（就是比较难记的字），以便更好地进行阅读和写话。方法是由后向前分段进行复习和测验。每次复习的字数，可按照学员的不同程度来决定。复习中应该注意：第一，要避免无重点的复习，对难记的字不要作记号；第二，要注意字形，以免字形相同或差别较少的字混淆起来；第三，要实行互助，反对只管自己、不管别人的现象。因此，在复习中教员不能有丝毫的松懈，必须深入地具体地对学员进行帮助和指导，以便很顺利地展开下一个步骤——阅读和写话。
