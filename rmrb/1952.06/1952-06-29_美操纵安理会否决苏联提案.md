Xinhua News Agency, New York: On June 26th, the American-British bloc in the Security Council vetoed a Soviet proposal calling upon all countries to participate in and ratify the Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons. After the translation of Malik's speech on June 25th was completed, Malik announced that no one else requested to speak, and immediately put the Soviet proposal to a vote.

    The Soviet Union voted in favor of the proposal; the remaining ten members of the Security Council abstained.

    Malik made a brief statement saying: On this issue, as in the case of the Tunisian question previously submitted to the Security Council, abstention is equivalent to a negative vote. Malik said: Under pressure from the ruling circles of the United States, the Security Council failed to pass a proposal to strengthen international peace and security.

    After Malik made a brief statement, U.S. representative Gross tried to "explain" his reasons for voting against the Soviet proposal. Gross concluded by saying: The United States withdrew its original proposal to refer the Soviet proposal to the United Nations Disarmament Commission and argued that this suggestion should not be debated.

    美操纵安理会否决苏联提案
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：六月二十六日，安全理事会中的美英集团否决了苏联所提出的提案，这个提案要求安全理事会号召所有国家参加并批准禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。在马立克六月二十五日的发言翻译完了以后，马立克宣布没有人再要求发言，随即把苏联的提案付诸表决。
    苏联投票赞成这一提案；安全理事会其余的十个理事国弃权。
    马立克作简短发言说：在这个问题上，像在先前向安全理事会提出的突尼斯问题上的情形一样，弃权就等于投反对票。马立克说：安全理事会在美国统治集团的压力下使一个为了加强国际和平与安全的提案未能获得通过。
    在马立克作了简短发言以后，美国代表葛罗斯设法“解释”他为什么投票反对苏联提案的理由。葛罗斯最后说：美国撤销它原来所提把苏联提案交由联合国裁减军备委员会考虑的建议，并主张对这一建议不作辩论。
