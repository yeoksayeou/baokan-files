Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, TASS New York, June 24th: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 23rd, chaired by Malik, to first discuss whether to include the U.S. proposal to investigate the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea on the agenda. After the U.S. delegation suggested adding this item to the agenda, Malik said that the Soviet Union was willing to include it, but without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it would be impossible to discuss this issue.

He said that for this reason, the Soviet Union suggested that, while including the U.S. proposal on the agenda, the Security Council should invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion. He said that the events directly related to the issue raised by the U.S. occurred on the territory of these two countries, so without the participation of representatives from these two countries, discussing the issue raised by the U.S. would not achieve the deserved results.

Malik pointed out that since the U.S. launched its aggression against Korea, the U.S.-British bloc has established the practice of discussing issues on a one-sided basis (according to the Americans). The U.S. bloc is doing this in violation of the Charter and the Security Council's rules of procedure, and it is contrary to common sense.

Malik finally emphasized that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, discussing the U.S. proposal would be unfair and would violate the United Nations Charter.

The U.S. representative, Gross, said that the Security Council must first adopt the agenda before considering the proposal to invite other countries to participate in the Security Council's discussion of this issue.

Gross distorted Malik's meaning, trying to make it seem as if Malik suggested inviting China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea first, and then adopting the agenda.

In his reply, Malik pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal emphasized taking both actions simultaneously: adopting the agenda while simultaneously inviting representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He said that the U.S. representative either did not understand the Soviet Union's proposal or deliberately distorted its meaning. Malik also said that the U.S. wants to present this issue unilaterally, wanting the Security Council to only listen to the U.S.'s side of the story.

Malik explained that this approach is a crude and arbitrary one. He said that the U.S. can only give orders in the North Atlantic Alliance. In the Security Council, all members are sovereign and independent countries, and discussions are conducted on an equal footing, and the U.S. is not allowed to run roughshod. Malik continued that if the participation of representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea cannot be guaranteed, the Soviet delegation will never agree to include the issue proposed by the U.S. on the agenda.

The Soviet delegation suggested a fair and normal solution to this issue: include the issue on the agenda and simultaneously invite representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the issue.

The Security Council meeting is still ongoing.

Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, TASS New York, June 24th: As previously reported, the Security Council's June 23rd meeting discussed the U.S. proposal to include the investigation of the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea on the agenda. Soviet representative Malik said that the Soviet Union was willing to include this proposal on the agenda, and he pointed out that representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should be invited to participate in the discussions. U.S. representative Gross insisted that the U.S. delegation's proposal should be included on the agenda in its original form, that is, without inviting representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the Security Council's discussions. Gross tried to make it seem as if Malik was using his position as President of the Security Council to obstruct a decision on the U.S.'s proposal to include the U.S. proposal on the agenda.

British representative Jebb supported the U.S.'s position.

Malik pointed out the clumsiness of the U.S. representative's behavior and emphasized that his statement was baseless. Malik said that he had convened a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the U.S. proposal. He said that regardless of whether he was the President of the Security Council, the Soviet delegation would propose inviting representatives from China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion.

Greek representative Kyrou demanded an immediate vote on whether the U.S. proposal should be included on the agenda in its original form. Malik said that he was willing to put the issue to a vote, but there were still five representatives who wanted to speak, and it was already late.

After some further discussion, the Security Council decided to reconvene on June 25th.

### 马立克建议安理会邀请我国和朝鲜代表参加讨论美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器问题

    马立克建议安理会邀请我国和朝鲜代表参加讨论美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器问题
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：联合国安全理事会在二十三日举行会议，由马立克担任主席，首先讨论是否把美国关于在朝鲜使用细菌武器事进行调查的建议列入议程。在美国代表团建议把这一项目列入议程之后，马立克说，苏联愿意把它列入议程，但是如果没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，对这问题是不可能进行讨论的。
    他说，因为这个原故，所以苏联建议，在把美国建议列入议程的同时，安全理事会应该邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论。他说，和美国所提出的问题有直接关联的事件发生在这两个国家的领土上，所以如果没有这两国的代表参加而来讨论美国所提出的问题，那是不会达到应得的结果的。
    马立克指出，自从美国开始了对朝鲜的侵略以来，美英集团就确立了在片面的基础上（照美国人的说法）讨论问题的惯例。美国集团这样做是违犯宪章和安全理事会的程序规则的，并且是违反常理的。
    马立克最后强调指出，如果没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，就讨论美国的建议，那是不公道的，而且是违反联合国宪章的。
    美国代表葛罗斯说，安全理事会首先必须通过议程，而后才能考虑邀请别的国家参加安全理事会对这问题的讨论的建议。
    葛罗斯歪曲马立克的意思，力图把事情说成好像马立克建议首先邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，而后再通过议程。
    马立克在答覆中指出，苏联的建议强调同时采取这两个行动：通过议程，同时并邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表。他说，美国代表不是没有明白苏联的建议，就是故意歪曲苏联建议的意思。马立克又说，美国要片面地提出这个问题，要安全理事会只听取美国的一面之辞。
    马立克说明这种办法是一种粗暴专断的办法。他说，美国只有在北大西洋联盟里才能发号施令，在安全理事会里，各成员都是主权独立的国家，讨论都在平等的基础上进行，是不容许美国横行霸道的。马立克继续说，如果不能保证中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论，苏联代表团就决不同意把美国建议的问题列入议程。
    苏联代表团就这问题建议了一个公道而正常的解决办法：把这问题列入议程，同时邀请中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加问题的讨论。
    安全理事会会议仍在继续进行中。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：如前已报道过的，安全理事会六月二十三日会议上讨论了美国所提把调查在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题列入议程的建议。苏联代表马立克说，苏联愿意把这个建议列入议程，他指出应邀请中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论。美国代表葛罗斯坚持主张应按照原来的形式把美国代表团的建议列入议程，即不邀请中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加安全理事会的讨论。葛罗斯想把事情说成好像马立克利用安全理事会主席的地位，阻挠就美国所提把美国的建议列入议程的提案采取决定。
    英国代表杰伯支持美国的主张。
    马立克指出美国代表的行为的笨拙，并着重指出他的说法毫无根据。马立克说，他已召开了安理会特别会议讨论美国的建议，他说，不管他是否任安全理事会主席，苏联代表团都要提出邀请中国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论的建议。
    希腊代表基鲁要求立即表决是否应把美国的建议按照原来的形式列入议程。马立克说，他愿意把问题提付表决，但是仍然有五个代表要求发言，而且时间已经迟了。
    又略作了一些讨论后，安全理事会就决定六月二十五日再开会。
