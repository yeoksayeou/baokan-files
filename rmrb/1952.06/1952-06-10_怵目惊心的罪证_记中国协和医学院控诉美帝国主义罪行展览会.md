Shocking Evidence of Crimes
——An Account of the Exhibition at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on the Crimes of American Imperialism
By Our Reporter

We have long exposed the schemes of American imperialism in running "charitable causes" and "educational undertakings" in China. The Exhibition at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on the Crimes of American Imperialism provides even more shocking evidence, specifically illustrating why the American "Oil King" wanted to establish the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) in Beijing and what evil deeds the American imperialists carried out through this medical school. This, although only a small part of the evidence of American imperialism’s long-term cultural aggression against our country, is enough to reveal its inhuman and beastly nature.

I. The Motives and Purposes of the American "Oil King" in Founding "PUMC"

Many archives displayed at the exhibition clearly illustrate the motives and purposes of the American imperialists in founding PUMC. The American "Oil King," Rockefeller, sent "investigation teams" to China in 1908, 1911, and 1914 to investigate and study China’s political, economic, and cultural situation. Rockefeller also convened a "China Problem Symposium" in January 1914, attended by "China experts," such as Tenney, the founder of Beiyang University, and Franklin C. McLean, who later served as president of PUMC. They analyzed the situation in China at the time, believing that "62 percent of the leading figures in the Chinese government had studied in Japan, the United States, and Europe, and they could be cleverly made to work well without much expense." In the same year, based on the results of the investigation in China, the investigation team concluded that "due to the great receptivity of the Chinese people, there might be unlimited benefits and useful results, and it should be strongly recommended that the Rockefeller Foundation enter the Chinese market." China has vast land and abundant resources, the "receptivity of the people" is great, and the "leading figures in the Chinese government" are so easily controlled, so Rockefeller himself also believed that this was an "unprecedented good opportunity." At the same time, in order to compete with other imperialists, he believed that it was necessary to seize this opportunity, and "the so-called competition is competing to obtain benefits from the Chinese government, but there is no competition in giving benefits to the Chinese government." These records reflect the viscera of aggression-prone American imperialism.

The question is how to carry out aggression. The records of the 1914 "China Problem Symposium" answered this question: "Hygiene work is a non-partisan work, and no matter how the regime changes, it still interests everyone." The 1946 report of the Rockefeller Foundation's investigation team also stated: "The most important question we need to consider when choosing any plan is: what impact can it have... The success of doing business (?) in China is greatly related to charity (!)... Therefore, we believe that running industry in China is completely impractical. We believe that the smartest and cheapest thing is to focus on running medicine."

"Running medicine" is indeed a kind of "charitable cause," but it must be combined with another kind of "charitable cause" – "running schools" – to play a greater role. James, the president of the University of Illinois, said in a memorandum to the President of the United States: "Which country can educate this generation of young Chinese people, which country will gain the greatest possible harvest in spiritual and commercial influence due to the efforts of this payment." At the "China Problem Symposium," an imperialist also said: "I think the most interesting thing is to train some Chinese leaders who will do things that we want them to do." "Counseling and supervision of China's friendship in education are more beneficial than financial assistance. This has an important role in improving Sino-American relations." Franklin C. McLean, the former president of PUMC, said even more bluntly in a letter to Lan An-sheng (a major secret agent), an American advisor to the Nanjing puppet health department: "I believe that supporting universities with one million U.S. dollars is more powerful for the Chiang regime than maintaining an army with two million U.S. dollars, because the army can mutiny at any time, and the students cultivated in this way will be more docile and reliable."

On the question of how to cultivate "reliable" people, the American imperialists had very thorough calculations. The records of the "China Problem Symposium" stated: Some Chinese "conservatives still have self-esteem... So the old examination methods should still be maintained, so they will not object to foreigners' control in China." They said that there are still some people in China who "oppose the rule of the old scholars" and are willing to accept their "help," and for these people, "the best way is to use economic methods and issue bonuses with lax regulations. After a period of time, gradually the Chinese will have to conform to the requirements of the foundation committee, and at the same time, they can say to the conservatives: 'We have no alliance with foreigners.'" Look, what a malicious conspiracy! Founding "PUMC" was one of the means to implement this conspiracy.

II. A Record of "Medical Practice" Crimes

PUMC’s "business" is a double "charitable cause" of American "Oil King" running medicine and schools in China. Let us take a look at the inside story of this "business."

The exhibition displays many shocking pictures and written records, illustrating the "achievements" in "medical practice." The magnificent gate of the PUMC Hospital was originally opened exclusively for "higher-class Chinese" in leather shoes and suits, but there were actually "third-class wards" in the hospital that accommodated Chinese working people. It is said that the patients here were still "treated for free." The essence of the matter lies in a "rules for admission" for patients in the third-class ward: "Patients are admitted for treatment on the condition that they are willing to be reasonably used for teaching purposes. Patients must be willing to undergo all examinations... If they are unwilling to cooperate, they can be discharged." Countless inhumane and bloody crimes occurred behind this "rule."

In order to cut off a certain part of the patient’s body as a specimen, or to conduct a certain drug experiment, the American imperialists killed the patient alive. A peanut was stuck in Zhang Qijiu's trachea, and it could have been clamped out with pliers. However, Dr. Schick of the Department of Otolaryngology needed a specimen of the child’s lung, so he deliberately used a rubber tube to randomly puncture the trachea of this child who was less than one year old, causing him to suffocate to death immediately. Relapsing fever can be effectively treated with "606," but the medical record of Tian Yushan, a relapsing fever patient, stated: "This person will not be treated with '606' because it needs to be reserved for Dr. Meleney for research." In order to observe the changes in the brain, Lehman, an imperialist in the Department of Neurology, deliberately performed lethal doses of radiation on the brains of mentally ill patients Dong Xiaoyong and Wu Xuanqiu. His ulcerated brain was made into a specimen, which, along with Lehman’s paper, is on display at the exhibition. According to the materials provided in the archives alone, this Lehman conducted experiments with convulsant drugs (Cardiazol) on sixty-nine Chinese people (forty-nine mentally ill patients and twenty healthy rickshaw pullers) in 1936. The rickshaw pullers were lured with the price of two U.S. dollars per injection. When the injected person was suffering from severe convulsions and almost stopped breathing, Lehman still said, "It doesn't matter, I am responsible." A short film recently found in the warehouse (said to have not been taken away because it was not well shot) vividly depicts the cruel scene of this experiment. Both victims were very strong, convulsing naked on the hospital bed, gasping for breath. According to worker Mo Fumin, who witnessed this tragic scene, the convulsing person was in so much pain that he bent the iron bars on the hospital bed, and the quilt soaked with sweat could be wrung out with water.

At this exhibition, we also saw the crimes of American imperialists conducting bacteriological experiments on Chinese people. In order to conduct experiments on relapsing fever and typhus, Meleney, a professor of internal medicine, and Randle, a doctor of public health, forced orphans in orphanages and other poor people to feed lice, tying paper boxes filled with lice to their arms for up to twelve hours each time. Ming Lebin, a worker in the hospital, suffered from relapsing fever three times in four months as a result of feeding lice many times. Lian Qingkui, a commentator at the exhibition, was a worker in the hospital’s laundry room. He was personally poisoned and accused the beasts in clothing of their crimes on the spot. "Skin and venereal disease expert" Pearce had conducted trypanosomiasis experiments on a large number of black people in Africa. After arriving at "PUMC," he inoculated patients with living syphilis spirochetes to conduct "immunity experiments." A photo of a chancre patient is evidence of this experiment.

For the convenience of "experiments," the executioners also specially set up three so-called "convalescent homes," each with about 20 homeless poor people, some died, and new ones were added. Mo Fumin, the commentator at the exhibition, said: "Don't mention the convalescent home. We used to deliver food to the people there, called feeding the anatomy materials." Anatomy materials are materials for dissection. We saw an article published by Professor Dou William of the hospital in the American "Scientific Monthly," which introduced how Americans used the famine in China at that time to hire 20,000 poor people as experimental subjects. He said: "We don't have that many rats for experiments."

The "extraterritoriality" enjoyed by the imperialists during the rule of the reactionary government of old China was the amulet for all these bloody crimes. In 1933, Spies, a tumor specialist, killed the patient Li Techeng. When the family filed a complaint, it was blocked by "extraterritoriality." The "philanthropists" of Wall Street don't know how much blood debt they owe the Chinese people!

III. A Record of "School-Running" Crimes

In order to erase this blood debt from the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people, the American imperialists worked hard in "running schools," carrying out their enslavement education and cultivating pro-American and fear-American ideas. They used so-called "international standards" and "American doctorates" as bait to lure "docile and reliable" Chinese people to serve as their "education" objects. They first replaced Chinese with English to destroy the national consciousness of Chinese youth. We saw such written "rules" at the exhibition: "If the Chinese proficiency of students is not up to standard during the entrance examination, they can write the same article in English. If the students' English knowledge is insufficient, which affects their medical studies, it must be considered equally with other factors that determine whether they can continue their studies." In 1930, when two students were talking in Chinese in the laboratory, Fortner, the head of the Department of Anatomy, immediately warned: "At PUMC, only English is the legal language." At the same time, they overwhelmed the students with heavy homework, so that they had no time to ask about politics and carry out patriotic activities; they also used "grades" to numb the students' minds. A student named Hua Fuyi had to read more than 170 designated reference books in two months in order to write a paper. Every time the students did physiological experiments, they had to work from 2 pm to late at night in order to submit a "standard" diagram. Huang Meijin, a student at the Nursing School, was expelled because her average grade for the academic year was only 79.3. There are countless such materials at the exhibition. They even used the so-called "standards of innate health and beauty" to insult the students of the Nursing School. In the grading standards for the health course of the Nursing School, there is such a "standard," the content of which is: height and weight suitable for age and body, shiny hair, bright eyes, neat teeth, and a mouth with a pleasant expression...

Some of the "reliable" "talents" cultivated in this way were assigned to various parts of China to "work in the most important government and private institutions... to gain various positions that expand influence everywhere" (see the article "PUMC Current Situation and Needs" in 1933); some stayed in the hospital to work, learning from their "teachers" to find "strange" diseases and "interesting" diseases, and adopting an indifferent attitude towards ordinary patients. When a patient with osteomalacia was admitted to PUMC, the doctors thought it was an extremely "interesting" case. In order to test the function of vitamin D, they gave the patient a diet extremely low in calcium and calories when the patient was in critical condition, causing the patient to develop tetany caused by calcium deficiency on the third day. More than a month later, the patient died, and the doctors performed an autopsy and wrote a paper that met "international standards." The 1946 report of the Rockefeller Foundation's investigation team to China stated: "The annual graduation of 30 to 40 doctors is not the most important thing; what is of infinite value is that we can use these graduates to set an example for other Chinese people, explaining what they can get from higher education." The aforementioned situation is the "example" they are talking about. In addition, there are "examples" of stealing intelligence. The exhibition displays many drafts of intelligence and letters of commendation from American bosses for these intelligence activities. The "China Problem Symposium" record stated: "We must try our best to obtain intelligence on the various battlefields that can be selected, so that when we decide on a foothold, we will understand all the problems that can be understood and take action in accordance with the best reports that can be obtained." Other documents prove that the scope of the American imperialists' spy activities was very wide, not only collecting "intelligence on the battlefield." Loucks "Professor," the former director of surgery at PUMC, was a major American secret agent disguised as "detached," "superficially amiable and kind, making us forget our motherland" (accusation by surgeon Zeng Xianjiu). He was a double agent sent by the U.S. State Department and the Rockefeller Foundation to the Far East. He contributed a strategy to Congress for invading China, saying: "Mr. Zhou Yide (a member of the U.S. Congress): The United States should stipulate that China should no longer use official foreign exchange to reduce the efficiency of charitable organizations' work (!)..." He maintained close contact with American spy agencies, and recorded many such activities in his diary: "November 26, 1948, I discussed the matter of transporting medicine with Bao Ruide (an American spy who plotted to bomb Tiananmen Square)", "I talked to Ke Lebo (the American consul) about security measures..." After liberation, he still boldly carried out a series of spy activities, such as instructing Dou William to sabotage political classes and forcing professors to sign to read American reactionary books and newspapers. When the American invading army landed in Incheon, Korea, he said in a letter to the school's administrative authorities that he wanted to return to Beijing with Dou William. Fu Meiling was a PUMC "registrar" sent by the Rockefeller Foundation. On the one hand, he controlled students' thoughts and restricted all students' activities, and on the other hand, he engaged in intelligence gathering activities without any scruples. In May 1949, Fu Meiling gave Loucks, who returned to the United States for "reporting duties," more than ten copies of intelligence, including "economic intelligence (unit index) and other items." Liu Zhen, a staff member of the General Affairs Section, accused Fu Meiling of how he used him to collect intelligence. Chen Renque, the secretary, accused Fu Meiling of the conspiracy of how he used him to investigate the list of Party and League members. In 1946, Peace, the secretary of the New York China Medical Promotion Association, wrote a letter praising Fu Meiling: "Here, there are many people who rely on you and appreciate your work."

The exhibition contains economic intelligence on Shandong from "biochemistry expert" Dou William to the American Consulate in Shandong, including the distribution, production details, and figures of national defense industries, minerals, and light industry departments. He attached a letter saying: "I believe that in the United States we should pay attention to training Shandong students related to the above industries; the methods and experience of the United States in these industries can be used in the industries of this province." The aforementioned Lan Ansheng was also a major American secret agent. He cultivated henchmen through "PUMC," controlled health institutions throughout China, used certain students of "PUMC" to collect intelligence, and collected intelligence from Southeast Asian countries and the Soviet Union under the banner of the "International Public Health Bureau." ... Former PUMC President McLean said in a letter to Vincent: "When there is not much to do in the public health work department directly managed by him (referring to Lan Ansheng), having a career at PUMC can naturally explain why he wants to stay in China." Isn't this clear enough?

There are also "examples" of stealing cultural relics. "Peking Man" is our extremely precious cultural relic, but it was stolen by American imperialists and is now stored in the American Museum of Natural History. The plaster model of the skull of "Peking Man" displayed at the exhibition aroused the audience's infinite anger.

The above is what "can be learned in higher education" under the control of American imperialists.

IV. PUMC Since Liberation

Facts have proved that no matter what American imperialism does, it cannot stop the power of the Chinese people, nor can it hinder China's liberation. A painting in the fourth exhibition room truly reflects the rebirth of Chinese teachers, students, and staff of PUMC after liberation. They immediately established a trade union, carried out the struggle against American imperialism, and achieved victory. The "charitable" coat was torn to pieces, and the inhuman Fu Meiling, Bowen, Dou William, Loucks, etc. were driven out of China in the first anti-imperialist upsurge. On January 20, 1951, the Central Ministry of Health officially took over the private Peking Union Medical College and renamed it the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

During the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, many teachers, students, and staff of PUMC participated in the volunteer surgical medical team and blood transfusion team. In the Three-Anti Movement, especially in the current stage of ideological construction, they are also ideologically cleansing the remaining poison left by American imperialism. At the accusation meeting held by the hospital on May 16 this year, they saw the bloody evidence, and the whole audience burst into tears. Wiping away their tears, they made angry accusations and painful self-criticisms, determined to use practical work to serve the motherland and the people and practical actions to Resist America and Aid Korea to wash away the shame given to them by American imperialism. The conspiracies and vicious schemes implemented by American imperialism in PUMC for decades have all gone bankrupt. We celebrate the rebirth of PUMC with infinite joy, and also with infinite hope, pray that PUMC will continue to move forward on the new road!

Before liberation, the imperialist Lehman openly injected convulsant drugs (Cardiazol) into the bodies of 69 Chinese compatriots (including rickshaw pullers) in PUMC Hospital for experiments. This experiment was extremely painful, and the subjects were prone to fractures, dislocations, and even respiratory arrest. This is a film taken by Lehman after injecting convulsant drugs into our Chinese compatriots.
Xinhua News Agency Draft

The imperialist Lehman used a large amount of radiation to irradiate the heads of three Chinese compatriots with mental illness to observe the changes. As a result, the heads of two of them were damaged by radiation and developed ulcers (see picture), and died one after another a year later.

I was one of the victims." Xinhua News Agency Draft

    怵目惊心的罪证
    ——记中国协和医学院控诉美帝国主义罪行展览会
    本报记者
    美帝国主义在中国办“慈善事业”、办“教育事业”的勾当，早被我们揭穿了。中国协和医学院控诉美帝国主义罪行展览会又提供了许多怵目惊心的罪证，具体说明了美国的“煤油大王”为什么要在北京办协和医学校，以及美帝国主义分子利用这个医学校干了些什么勾当。这虽然不过是美帝国主义对我国进行长期文化侵略的罪证的一小部分，但也足以表现出它的人面兽心的原形了。
    一、美国“煤油大王”创办“协和”的动机和目的
    陈列在展览会上的许多档案，非常清楚地说明了美帝国主义者创办协和的动机和目的。美国的“煤油大王”洛克斐勒曾在一九○八年、一九一一年、一九一四年先后派“考察团”到中国来，对中国的政治、经济、文化情况进行调查研究。洛克斐勒并在一九一四年一月间召开了一次“中国问题座谈会”，出席者都是“中国通”，如北洋大学的创办人丁尼和后来担任过“协和”校长的顾林等。他们分析了当时中国的情况，认为“中国政府的领导人物，有百分之六十二都在日本、美国和欧洲留过学，不必付出很大代价，便能聪明地使他们很好地工作。”同年考察团根据在中国考察的结果，断定“由于中国人民容受力之大，可能有无限的利益和有用的结果，应竭力推荐洛克斐勒基金委员会打入中国市场。”中国地大物博，“人民容受力”大，而“中国政府的领导人物”又那么易于驾御，所以洛克斐勒本人也认为这是“空前未有的好机会”。同时为了跟其他帝国主义竞争，他认为也必须抓紧这个机会，而“所谓竞争，就是竞相从中国政府得到利益，但在给予中国政府的好处上，并没有任何竞争。”这些纪录，把侵略成性的美帝国主义的五脏六腑，都反映出来了。
    问题在于如何进行侵略。对于这个问题，一九一四年“中国问题座谈会”的纪录回答道：“卫生工作是一个无党无派的工作，不管政权如何改变，它仍使所有的人感到兴趣。”一九四六年洛克斐勒基金委员会考察团的报告也说：“我们选择任何计划时最需要考虑的问题是：它能起什么影响……在中国办事业（？）成功与否，和慈善（！）有很大的关系……所以我们认为在中国办工业是完全不切合实际的。我们相信最聪明、最便宜的是集中办医。”
    “办医”固然是一种“慈善事业”，但一定要跟另一种“慈善事业”——“办学”结合起来，才能发挥更大的作用。伊里诺大学校长詹姆士在给美国总统的备忘录中说：“哪一个国家能做到教育这一代的年青中国人，哪一个国家便将由于这方面的支付的努力而在精神的和商业的影响上取得最大可能的收获。”“中国问题座谈会”上，也有一个帝国主义分子说：“我觉得最有趣的事是训练出一些中国的领导人物，他们将做些我们所愿意他们做到的事情。”“对中国在教育方面友谊的顾问与监督，比金钱的帮助更有益，这对于改善中美关系，有重要的作用。”“协和”前校长顾林在给南京伪卫生署美籍顾问兰安生（大特务）的信中说得更露骨了：“我相信用一百万美元来支持各大学，对蒋政权来说，比用二百万美元来维持军队，更有力量，因为军队可以随时叛变，至于由此培养出来的学生将会更加驯服可靠。”
    在如何培养“可靠”人士这一问题上，美帝国主义者的算盘是打得很周到的。“中国问题座谈会”记录中说：中国“有些保守派的人，还是有自尊心的……所以仍应保持旧的考试方法，这样他们就不反对外国人在中国的控制。”他们说中国还有一些人士“反对旧的学者的统治”，愿意接受他们的“帮助”，对这些人“最好是用经济的方法，发给规章不严格的奖金。这样经过一个时期，渐渐地中国人就不得不符合于基金委员会的要求，同时他们又可以对保守派说：‘我们与外国没有什么盟约。’”你看，这是何等恶毒的阴谋！创办“协和”，便是实施这种阴谋的手段之一。
    二、“办医”罪行录
    “协和”的“事业”是美国“煤油大王”在中国办医、办学的双重“慈善事业”，让我们来看看这个“事业”的内幕吧。
    展览会上陈列着许多惊心动魄的图片和文字纪录，说明了“办医”方面的“业绩”。金碧辉煌的协和医院的大门，原是专为革履西装的“高等华人”开的，但院内居然也有收容中国劳动人民的“三等病房”，据说这里的病人还是“免费治疗”的。问题的实质在于一纸三等病房病人的“入院规则”：“病人住院治疗，附有条件，即须愿被合理地用作教学目的。病人必须愿受一切检验……如不愿合作，可出院。”无数惨无人道的血腥罪行，便在这个“规则”背后发生了。
    美帝国主义分子为了割取病人身上某一部分做标本，或为了进行某项药物的试验，就把病人活活弄死。一粒花生米塞在张琪玖的气管里，只要用钳子把它夹出来就得了。但耳鼻喉科大夫斯莱克需要孩子肺部做标本，便故意用橡皮管乱通这个不满一周岁的孩子的气管，使他立刻窒息而死。回归热可以用“六○六”作有效的治疗，但在回归热患者田玉山的病历上却写着：“此人不予‘六○六’治疗，因需留给梅伦纳大夫研究用。”脑系科帝国主义分子雷曼为了观察脑子的变化，故意在精神病患者董小永和吴轩秋的脑部进行致死量的放射线照射。他的溃烂的大脑被作成了标本，它跟雷曼的论文一同陈列在展览会上。仅据档案所提供的材料，这个雷曼一九三六年在六十九个中国人（四十九个精神病患者和二十个健康的人力车工人）身上作过抽风药（卡的阿错）的实验，人力车工人是用每注射一次得两元美金的代价诱骗来的。当被注射者受着剧烈抽风、几乎停止呼吸的痛苦时，雷曼还说“不要紧，我负责。”最近从仓库里找出来的电影短片（据说因为照得不好，没有被带走），活生生地表现了这种实验的惨酷景象。两个被害人都很强壮，赤条条地在病床上抽搐着，急喘着。据目睹这种惨状的工友莫福绵说，抽风的人痛苦得把病床上的铁条都弄弯了，被汗水湿透了的褥子，可以拧出水来。
    在这个展览会上，我们还看到美帝国主义分子在中国人身上进行细菌实验的罪行。内科教授梅伦纳和公共卫生科大夫蓝杜亚为了作回归热和斑疹伤寒的试验，竟强迫孤儿院的孤儿和其他穷苦人民喂养虱子，用装满虱子的纸匣子绑在他们的手臂上，每次达十二小时之久。该院工人明乐斌，由于多次喂养虱子的结果，在四个月里生了三次回归热。展览会上的讲解员连清奎，是该院洗衣房工人，他曾亲受毒害，当场控诉了那些衣冠禽兽的罪行。“皮肤花柳科专家”裴尔斯，曾在非洲大批黑人身上作过锥虫病试验，到“协和”后，又用活的梅毒螺旋体接种在病人身上，进行“免疫试验”。一张下疳病患者的照片，就是这种试验的罪证。
    为便于“实验”起见，刽子手们还特别设立了三个所谓“调养院”，每个经常住着二十个左右无家可归的穷苦人，有的死了，又补充了新的。展览会的讲解员莫福绵说：“不要提调养院了。我们过去给那里的人送饭，叫做喂剖料。”剖料就是解剖的材料。我们看到该院教授窦威廉曾在美国“科学月刊”上发表的一篇文章，它介绍了美国人怎样利用当时中国的饥荒，雇用了两万穷苦人民做试验品的情况。他说：“我们用老鼠作试验，还没有那么多。”
    旧中国反动政府统治时期帝国主义所享受的“治外法权”，是这一切血腥罪行的护符。一九三三年瘤系科司皮斯治死了病人李特成，家属提出控诉，就被“治外法权”挡回去了。华尔街的“慈善”家们，不知道欠我们中国人民多少血债！
    三、“办学”罪行录
    为要从中国人民的思想感情上抹去这笔血债，美帝国主义者就在“办学”方面下功夫，进行其奴化教育，培养崇美恐美思想。他们以所谓“国际标准”、“美国博士”等为饵，引诱“驯服可靠”的中国人来充当他们的“教育”对象。他们首先用英文代替中文，以摧残中国青年的民族意识。我们在展览会上看到这样的成文“规则”：“学生入学考试时，中文程度如不合标准，可用英文写同样的文章。学生英文知识不足，影响其医学学习时，须和决定其能否继续学习的其他因素同等考虑。”一九三○年，两个学生在实验室里用中国话交谈了几句，解剖学系主任福泰因当场提出警告：“在协和，只有英文才是合法的言语。”同时，他们用繁重的功课把学生压得喘不过气来，使他们没有时间过问政治，进行爱国活动；他们又用“分数”来麻醉学生的头脑。一个名叫华复一的学生，为了写一篇论文，不得不在两个月中看完一百七十多本被指定的参考书。学生每次做生理实验，为要交上一张合乎“标准”的图，不得不从下午二点钟做到深夜。护士学校的学生黄美金，因为学年平均分数只有七十九点三，被开除了学籍。展览会上这一类材料，举不胜举。他们甚至用什么“天赋的健康和美丽的标准”来侮辱护士学校的学生们。在护士学校卫生课程的考试记分标准中，就有这样的一条“标准”，其内容是：适合于年龄和身材的身高和体重、光亮的头发、闪亮的眼睛、整齐的牙齿、有愉快表情的嘴……。
    这样培养出来的“可靠”“人才”，有的被分配到全中国各地去，“在政府与私人最重要的机关中工作……以取得到处扩大影响的各种地位（见一九三三年“协和现状和需要”一文）；有的留在医院里工作，学着“老师”们找“怪”病，找“有兴趣”的病，对于普通病人则采取漠不关心的态度。一个骨质软化的病人入协和就医，大夫们认为这是极端“有兴趣”的病例。为要试验丁种维生素的功用，他们在病人病危的情况下，给病人吃含钙及热量极低的膳食，使病人在第三天就生了由缺乏钙所引起的搐弱症。一个多月后，病人死了，大夫们便进行尸体解剖，写了一篇够“国际标准”的论文。一九四六年洛克斐勒基金委员会来华考察团的报告中说：“每年三四十个大夫毕业出来，还不是最主要的事情；有无限价值的是：我们可以用这些毕业出来的人来给其他中国人作出一种示例，说明他们可以从高等学校里得到什么。”前述的情况，就是他们所说的“示例”吧。此外还有偷窃情报的“示例”，展览会上就陈列着不少情报的底稿和美国老板嘉奖这些情报活动的信件。 “中国问题座谈会”记录中说：“我们要尽量得到关于可选择的各战场的情报，这样当我们决定一个插足点时，我们会了解所有能了解的问题，可以依照可能得到的最好报告，采取行动。”其他文件又证明了美帝国主义分子的特务活动范围非常广泛，不仅收集“战场的情报”。“协和”前外科主任娄克斯“教授”，就是伪装“超然”、“表面上和蔼、亲切，使我们忘掉祖国”（外科大夫曾宪九控诉语）的美国大特务。他是美国国务院及罗氏基金委员会派来远东的双料特务。他向国会供献侵华策略说：“周以德（美国会议员）先生：美国应规订中国不要再用官价外汇来减低慈善团体工作（！）的效率……”他与美国间谍机关保持密切联系，在他日记本上记着很多这类活动：“一九四八年十一月二十六日，我与包瑞德（阴谋炮轰天安门的美国间谍）商量运药事”，“我与柯乐柏（美国领事）谈及安全措施……”在解放以后，他仍然大胆地进行一连串的特务活动，如指使窦维廉破坏政治课，强迫教授签名看美国反动书报。美国侵略军在朝鲜仁川登陆时，他给学校行政当局的信中说，他想和窦维廉一起回北京。福美龄是罗氏基金委员会派来的协和“注册主任”，他一方面控制学生思想，限制学生一切活动，一方面毫无顾忌地从事搜集情报活动。一九四九年五月福美龄给返美“述职”的娄克斯十余份情报，其中有“经济情报（单位指数）等项”。总务科职员刘振控诉了福美龄如何利用他搜集情报的罪行，秘书陈仁确控诉了福美龄如何利用他调查党团员名单的阴谋。一九四六年纽约中华医学促进会秘书皮斯来信夸奖福美龄说：“在这里，有许多人倚赖你，欣赏你的工作。”
    展览会上有“生物化学专家”大特务窦维廉给山东美国领事馆的山东经济情报，里面有国防工业、矿产、轻工业部门分布状况、生产详情和数字。他附信说：“我相信在美国我们应当注意训练有关上列工业的山东学生；美国在这些工业方面的方法和经验可以用在这个省份的工业方面。”前面提到过的蓝安生，也是一个美国大特务，他通过“协和”培养爪牙，掌握全中国卫生机构，利用“协和”某些学生，搜集情报，并打着“国际公共卫生局”的招牌，搜集东南亚各国和苏联的情报。……“协和”前校长顾林给文森的信中说：“在他（指蓝安生）直接管理的公共卫生工作部门没有多大事情可做的时候，有了协和的职业，便可以很自然地为他解释他为什么要留在中国。”这难道还说得不够清楚吗？
    还有盗窃文物的“示例”。“北京人”是我们极珍贵的文物，却被美帝国主义分子盗窃去了，现在存在美国自然博物馆里。陈列在展览会上的“北京人”头骨的石膏模型，引起了观众的无限愤怒。
    上述种种，就是在美帝国主义分子掌握下的“高等学校里可以学到”的东西。
    四、解放以来的协和
    事实证明了美帝国主义无论如何都阻挡不住中国人民的力量，无法阻挠中国的解放。第四展览室里的一幅画，真实地反映了解放后的协和中国师生和职工的新生。他们马上建立了工会，进行了反对美帝国主义的斗争，取得了胜利。“慈善”的外衣被撕得粉碎了，人面兽心的福美龄、博文、窦威廉、娄克斯等，就在第一次反帝怒潮中被赶出了中国。一九五一年一月二十日，中央卫生部正式接收了私立北京协和医学院，并把它改为中国协和医学院。
    在抗美援朝运动中，协和不少师生职工参加了志愿手术医疗队、输血队。在三反运动中，特别是在目前思想建设阶段，他们又从思想上清洗着美帝国主义留给他们的余毒。在今年五月十六日的该院控诉大会上，他们看到了血淋淋的罪证，全场痛哭失声。他们揩着眼泪，进行了愤怒的控诉和沉痛的自我检讨，决心用为祖国、为人民服务的实际工作和抗美援朝的实际行动来洗雪美帝国主义给予他们的耻辱。美帝国主义几十年来在协和所施行的阴谋毒计，全部破产了。我们怀着无限的愉快庆贺协和的新生，也带着无限的希望，祝祷协和在新的道路上不断前进！

    解放前，帝国主义分子雷曼竟于协和医院明目张胆地在我国六十九个同胞（其中包括人力车工人）身上注射抽风药（卡的阿错），进行试验。这种试验是无比痛苦的，被试验者很容易骨折、脱臼甚至呼吸停止。这是雷曼在我国同胞身上注射抽风药后所摄的电影片。
