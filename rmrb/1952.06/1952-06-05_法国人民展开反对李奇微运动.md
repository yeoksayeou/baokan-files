    French People Launch Anti-Ridgway Movement
    The new Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic aggressive forces, Ridgway, arrived in Paris on May 27th. The French people expressed strong protests against the arrival of this American murderer, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Korean people and prisoners of war and who openly launched germ warfare. People across France responded to the call of the French Communist Party and, regardless of the brutal suppression by the Pinay reactionary government, launched large-scale protest movements. "Ridgway, get back to America!" "Germ murderer, get back!" The shouts resounded throughout France. This fully demonstrates the French people's desire for peace and independence and their firm will to oppose American occupation and oppose preparations for aggressive war.
    The powerful demonstrations by people across France have alarmed Ridgway and his lackey, the Pinay government. Under the instructions of its American masters, the Pinay government carried out bloody suppression of the demonstrating masses, killing and wounding more than a hundred demonstrators in Paris on May 28, and illegally arresting French Communist Party leader Duclos and more than seven hundred demonstrators; and illegally arrested "l'Humanité" editor-in-chief Stieglitz on May 24. The Pinay government also ordered the confiscation of eleven democratic newspapers in Paris and other French cities and the closure of progressive trade unions. The Pinay government's brutal suppression of the French Communist Party and the French people's movement for peace and national independence further exposes them as shameful lackeys serving the interests of American imperialism.
    The Pinay government's persecution of the French Communist Party and the French people has aroused even more fierce resistance from the French people. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on May 29, calling on the French working people and all French people who cherish French independence and peace to express strong protests and demand the immediate release of Duclos. The just struggle of the French people has won the warm support of the people of all countries in the world. The Hungarian Working People's Party, the Italian Communist Party, the German Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party have all sent telegrams to the French Communist Party, protesting the Pinay government's arrest of Duclos and supporting the French people's struggle for peace and national independence. The Romanian people held protest demonstrations. Workers in enterprises in various Italian cities broke out in spontaneous protest strikes. With the support of the people of Europe and the people of the world, the French people's struggle for peace and independence will be further developed and thoroughly defeat the frantic attacks of American imperialism and the French reactionary government.

    法国人民展开反对李奇微运动
    美国新任北大西洋侵略军总司令李奇微于五月二十七日到了巴黎。法国人民对这个双手染满朝鲜人民和战俘鲜血并公然发动细菌战的美国凶手的到来，表示了强烈的抗议。法国各地人民响应法国共产党的号召，不顾比内反动政府的野蛮镇压，展开大规模的抗议运动。“李奇微滚回美国去！”“细菌杀人犯滚回去！”的呼声响遍全法国。这充分表现了法国人民争取和平与独立的愿望和反对美国占领、反对准备侵略战争的坚决意志。
    法国各地人民的强大的示威运动，已使李奇微及其走狗比内政府惊惶失措。在其美国主子的指使下，比内政府对示威群众进行了血腥的镇压，于五月二十八日打死打伤巴黎示威群众一百多人，非法逮捕了法国共产党领袖杜克洛和示威群众七百多人；并于五月二十四日非法逮捕了“人道报”总编辑斯梯。比内政府并下令没收巴黎和法国其他城市的十一种民主报纸，封闭进步工会。比内政府对法国共产党与法国人民争取和平与民族独立运动的蛮横镇压，进一步暴露他们是为美帝国主义的利益服务的可耻的奴才。
    比内政府对法国共产党和法国人民的迫害，已激起了法国人民更加猛烈的反抗。法国共产党政治局于五月二十九日发表声明，号召法国劳动人民和珍爱法国独立与和平的全体法国人民一致表示强烈的抗议，要求立即释放杜克洛。法国人民的正义斗争已获得世界各国人民的热烈支持。匈牙利劳动人民党、意大利共产党、德国共产党和中国共产党都致电法国共产党，抗议比内政府逮捕杜克洛，声援法国人民争取和平与民族独立的斗争。罗马尼亚人民举行了抗议示威。意大利各城市企业中的工人爆发了自发性的抗议罢工。在欧洲人民和全世界人民的支持下，法国人民争取和平与独立的斗争，必将进一步地开展起来，彻底打败美帝国主义和法国反动政府的疯狂进攻。
