Eliminating Locusts and Aphids is a Crucial Step in Striving for Bumper Grain and Cotton Harvests
    Zong Zunyi

Recently, locusts and cotton aphids have successively appeared in various regions. Eliminating locusts and aphids has become a crucial step in striving for bumper grain and cotton harvests this year.

Currently, locust nymph outbreaks have occurred in provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Pingyuan, Henan, Xinjiang, Hubei, and Hunan. In Hebei Province, more than 800,000 mu of farmland in 70 counties have been affected by locust nymphs. Shandong Province has found locust nymphs in 12 counties and cities. In northern Anhui, the area of farmland affected by locust nymphs in Sihong County alone has reached more than 300,000 mu. Locust nymphs have also been found in more than 10 counties including Guanyun in northern Jiangsu, and 18 counties in Pingyuan Province. The area of farmland affected by locust nymphs in Henan Province has reached more than 2.4 million mu (most of the locust nymphs found in Pingyuan and Henan are soil locusts). Locust nymphs have also been successively found in Dihua Prefecture, Aksu Prefecture, and Tacheng Prefecture in Xinjiang. In addition, rice locusts and bamboo locusts have been found in Hubei and Hunan. According to incomplete statistics, the area of farmland affected by rice locusts in Hunan has reached more than 170,000 mu.

Cotton aphids have also begun to appear in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Henan, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong. Cotton fields in Luoyang, Shangqiu, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Chenliu, Xinyang, Huaiyang, and other prefectures in Henan Province have mostly been affected by cotton aphids, with Shangqiu Prefecture being the most widespread. In the most severely affected areas, there were more than 100 aphids on each cotton seedling when the seedlings began to show true leaves. Cotton fields in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Dingxian and other five prefectures in Hebei Province have also been affected by cotton aphids.

The occurrence of insect pests this year is earlier than in previous years, and the affected areas are also more extensive. Cadres and the masses in various regions generally pay more attention to pest control work than in previous years, and the preparations are relatively thorough. Because locust control work requires a large amount of manpower, various regions have paid special attention to organizing manpower and preparing medicines and equipment before locust control this year. All regions are preparing to eliminate locusts before the third instar stage (locusts begin to move after the third instar, and become flying locusts after the fifth instar). Locusts mainly occur in sparsely populated wilderness areas along the coast and lakes. In the past, locust control often neglected the wilderness areas bordering provinces and counties. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has notified various regions to pay attention to checking the distribution area of ​​locust eggs and the emergence of locust nymphs, and to pay attention to establishing joint defense organizations in bordering areas, so that manpower can be quickly organized and eliminated in time after the locust nymphs appear.

The leading departments in most of the areas where locust nymphs have been found are generally very attentive to locust control work. Many leading cadres personally go to the locust-affected areas to guide locust control work. As of now, the locust nymphs found in the previous stage in various parts of Pingyuan Province have been basically eliminated. Of the more than 800,000 mu of land in Hebei Province where locust nymphs were found, more than 176,000 mu have been eliminated. More than 520,000 people in Shangqiu Prefecture, Henan Province, have participated in locust control work, and more than 21,000 jin of small nymphs have been captured, and an area of ​​618,000 mu has been treated.

In the work of eliminating cotton aphids, the general requirements this year are: early treatment, continuous treatment, universal treatment, and thorough treatment. The people's governments and the masses in various cotton-producing areas have paid more attention to the prevention and control of aphids this year, and some areas have been able to conduct inspections at any time and eliminate them in time. For example, areas where cotton aphids have been found in Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have generally begun to eliminate them, and some areas have been eliminated twice. In order to strengthen the work of eliminating cotton pests, the Central Ministry of Agriculture has held special training courses on diseases and insect pests in southern and northern cotton areas in Wuhan and Beijing, respectively. People who have been trained return to their original work areas and then train others in order to widely spread the technology of eliminating cotton pests. In order to implement the "Emergency Notice on Pest Control" issued by the State Council on April 22, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government has allocated additional loans specifically for purchasing pesticides for cotton pest control this year. The Central Ministry of Agriculture, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the People's Bank of China have jointly instructed their subordinate departments in various regions to actively prepare pesticides for cotton pests and distribute them to cotton farmers in various regions through grassroots cooperatives.

The work of eliminating locusts and aphids is an arduous struggle task, and this work is just beginning. The following points should be paid attention to in this work:

First, use human and material resources rationally. Locust eggs hatch at different times. If human resources cannot be used rationally and continuously to swat them, the masses are prone to fatigue. In large areas of wasteland, attention should be paid to checking the hatching of locust eggs, monitoring the activities of locust nymphs, grasping favorable opportunities, and eliminating them in one fell swoop. In farmland, it is necessary to check at any time, discover at any time, and eliminate immediately, without delay.

Second, continue to overcome the complacency of cadres and the masses. Generally speaking, most areas attach more importance to pest control work this year, but cadres and the masses in some areas are still complacent. For example, the leading cadres of the 13th District of Xinyang County, Henan Province, believe that it doesn't matter if locusts eat some crops. They are busy with the review of land reform, which caused some of the crops to be eaten up by locust nymphs. The leading departments in Peixian County, Shandong Province, believe that it is too early to control locusts and did not arrange locust control work in a timely manner. These are very harmful. Cotton aphids reproduce very quickly, so we must be vigilant, strengthen inspections, and eliminate them as soon as possible.

Third, earnestly solve the problem of insufficient pesticides and equipment for pest control. Currently, some areas do not have enough pesticides and equipment prepared for pest control. For example, of the 60 sprayers in Qiliying Village, Xinxiang, Pingyuan, 20 are leaking and need to be repaired. Aphids have occurred on all 11,000 mu of cotton in the village, but the prepared pesticides are only enough to treat 2,500 mu, and these pesticides are still stored in the village supply and marketing cooperative and have not been distributed to the masses. The masses in Yuezhuang, Huojia County, Pingyuan said: "Cotton aphids should be treated, but the pesticides have not arrived in the village." All regions should pay attention to in-depth inspections of this situation.

In order to thoroughly defeat insect pests and strive for bumper harvests of grain and cotton, all regions must ensure that locusts are eliminated in the nymph stage and that cotton aphids are eliminated as early as possible.

    灭蝗治蚜是争取粮棉丰收的重要环节
    宗尊易
    近日来各地相继发生蝗虫和棉蚜虫，灭蝗治蚜已成为今年争取粮棉丰收的一个重要环节。
    目前发生蝗蝻的地区有河北、山东、皖北、苏北、平原、河南、新疆、湖北、湖南等省。河北省七十个县有八十多万亩农田发生蝗蝻。山东省有十二个县市发现蝗蝻。皖北只泗洪一县发生蝗蝻的农田面积即达三十多万亩。苏北灌云等十多个县、平原十八个县也发现蝗蝻。河南省发生蝗蝻的农田面积达二百四十多万亩（平原、河南发现的蝗蝻大部为土蝗）。新疆迪化专区、阿克苏专区和塔城专区，也相继发现蝗蝻。此外，湖北、湖南还发现了稻蝗、竹蝗。据不完全的统计，湖南发生稻蝗的农田面积已达十七万多亩。
    棉蚜也开始在河北、河南、平原、山西、陕西、山东等主要产棉区发生。河南省的洛阳、商邱、郑州、许昌、陈留、信阳、淮阳等专区的棉田，大部发生了棉蚜，而以商邱专区最为普遍。最严重的地区，在棉苗开始露真叶时，每株棉苗上即有蚜虫一百多个。河北省的邯郸、邢台、石家庄、衡水、定县等五个专区的棉田，也发生了棉蚜。
    今年虫害发生的时间比往年早，发生的地区也比往年多。各地干部和群众对防治虫害工作一般比往年重视，准备工作比较周密。由于治蝗工作需要耗费大量人力，各地今年在治蝗以前，特别注意了组织人力和准备药械。各地都准备要把蝗虫消灭在三龄以前（蝗虫在三龄以后开始移动，五龄以后即变成飞蝗）。蝗虫主要发生在沿海、沿湖等人烟稀少的荒野地区。过去治蝗时，往往忽视省和省、县和县交界的荒野地区，今年中央人民政府农业部已通知各地注意检查蝗卵分布面积和蝗蝻出土情况，并注意建立交界地区的联防组织，以便在蝗蝻发生以后，能够迅速组织人力，及时扑灭。
    目前发现蝗蝻的大部地区的领导部门，一般都很注意治蝗工作。许多领导干部亲自到蝗区指导灭蝗工作。截至目前止，平原省各地前一阶段发现的蝗蝻已被基本消灭。河北省八十多万亩面积上发现的蝗蝻，已被消灭的有十七万六千多亩。河南省商邱专区参加灭蝗工作的有五十二万多人，已捕捉小蝻二万一千多斤，除治的面积有六十一万八千多亩。
    在除治棉蚜工作中，今年总的要求是：早治、连续治、普遍治、彻底治。各棉产区的人民政府和群众，今年对防治蚜虫已比较注意，部分地区已能做到随时检查，及时扑灭。例如河北、河南等省发现棉蚜的地区已普遍开始除治，有的地区已除治两遍。中央农业部为了加强除治棉花虫害的工作，分别在武汉、北京举办了南方、北方棉区病虫害专题训练班。受过训练的人，回到原来工作的地区，再训练别人，以便广泛传播除治棉花虫害的技术。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为贯彻四月二十二日政务院发布的“关于防治害虫的紧急通知”，特增拨贷款，专为购买今年防治棉花虫害的药剂之用。中央农业部、中华全国合作总社和中国人民银行已联合指示各地所属部门，积极准备防治棉虫药剂，分由各基层合作社供应各地棉农。
    灭蝗治蚜工作是一个艰苦的斗争任务，目前这一工作还正在开始。在这一工作中应注意做到以下几点：
    第一、合理使用人力物力。蝗卵孵化迟早不一，如果不能合理使用人力，连续扑打，群众容易疲惫。在大片荒地上，应注意检查蝗卵孵化情况，监视蝗蝻活动，掌握有利时机，一举加以消灭。在庄稼地里，则要随时检查，随时发现，立刻扑灭，不要延误。
    第二、继续克服干部和群众的麻痹思想。总的说来，今年大部地区对防治虫害工作都比较重视，但是部分地区的干部和群众仍然麻痹大意。如河南省信阳县十三区的领导干部，认为蝗虫吃点庄稼不算什么，他们忙于土地改革的复查工作，致使一部田禾被蝗蝻吃光。山东沛县领导部门认为治蝗为时过早，也没有及时布置灭蝗工作。这都是非常有害的。棉蚜繁殖很快，必须提高警惕，加强检查，及早扑灭。
    第三、认真解决治虫药械不足的问题。目前有些地区准备的治虫药械还不够用。如平原新乡七里营村的六十架喷雾器，就有二十架漏水，需要修理。全村一万一千亩棉花都已发生蚜虫，但准备的药剂只够治二千五百亩，而且这些药剂还存在村供销合作社，没有发到群众手里。平原获嘉县岳庄的群众说：“棉蚜该治了，药品还没有到村里。”这种情况各地都应注意深入检查。
    为了彻底战胜虫害，争取粮棉丰收，各地必须保证把蝗虫消灭在蝗蝻阶段，把棉蚜虫及早除治干净。
