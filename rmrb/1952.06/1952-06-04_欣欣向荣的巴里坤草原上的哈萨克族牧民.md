    Thriving Kazakh Herdsmen on the Balikun Grassland
    Zhao Huasheng
    The 10,412 Kazakh compatriots living on the Balikun Grassland north of the Tianshan Mountains were only liberated in June 1950. Because after Xinjiang announced its peaceful liberation on September 25, 1949, the habitual bandit Usman, under the instigation of American spy Mark Nan, deceived and threatened the vast number of Kazakh compatriots to carry out rebellion. It was not until June 1950, when the heroic People's Liberation Army eliminated the local bandits and captured the bandit leader Janim Khan alive, that the Kazakh compatriots on the Balikun Grassland were truly liberated.

    In the two years since liberation, the efforts made by the Zhenxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Xinjiang Province and the County People's Government for the liberation cause of these more than 10,000 Kazakh compatriots are difficult to describe in detail. In particular, Zhang Xiao, the secretary of the county party committee, devoted most of his energy to work in pastoral areas. From the day the Kazakhs approached the People's Government, he sent working teams to live and work with the Kazakh compatriots. The comrades of the working teams risked their lives and lived extremely hard lives, unable to live in houses or eat vegetables, but they had no complaints for the liberation cause of fraternal ethnic groups. They wholeheartedly served the fraternal ethnic groups, and now they have made brilliant achievements and written a glorious page in the history of the liberation cause of fraternal ethnic groups. This article will not describe how they led the masses to assist the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits and stabilizing social order, nor will it introduce how they worked hard in the pastoral areas. This article will only use a few figures to illustrate a truth.

    In the early days of liberation, among the more than 10,000 Kazakh compatriots in Zhenxi County, there was only one Kazakh cadre, who was sent to work in the tax bureau by the reactionary ruling class in the past for the convenience of collecting livestock taxes. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government attached great importance to the work of training cadres of fraternal ethnic groups. Now, there are 56 cadres at all levels of government in Zhenxi County, from deputy county magistrate and below to township clerks and above, who are separated from production; among them, there are also two female cadres, which is a rare event in Kazakh history. In addition, there are more than 100 members of the township governments in two districts and ten townships, 66 village heads, and women representatives and primary school teachers in each township and village. It has truly achieved what the herding masses sang when establishing the regime: "Destroy the old Baojia system, the people are in charge of the world."

    The livelihood of the herdsmen depends on livestock. Before liberation, the reactionary rulers only knew how to collect livestock taxes and did not care about the life or death of the herdsmen. After liberation, the People's Government paid special attention to the development of animal husbandry and vigorously supported it, so animal husbandry has developed rapidly. For example, in 1951, there were 135,985 sheep, and in that year, 48,296 sheep were added, an increase of more than 35 percent; there were 5,345 cattle, and 1,403 cattle were added, an increase of more than 26 percent; there were 13,534 horses, and 1,929 horses were added, an increase of more than 14 percent; there were 7,143 camels, and 880 camels were added, an increase of nearly 12 percent. The survival rate of young livestock in 1951 was the highest in history, so the herdsmen all said gratefully: "With the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our animal husbandry has developed." In 1951, some Kazakh people also engaged in agricultural production. With the strong support of the government and the help of Han farmers, they planted 140 shi and 6 dou and 6 sheng of land in the spring, and harvested 606 shi and 6 dou and 5 sheng of grain in the autumn. Some poor herdsmen also carried out winter sideline production, with 468 people participating, organizing 1,783 camels, 65 horses, and 10 cattle, and the profits were equivalent to about 232 shi and 1 dou and 3 sheng of wheat, which solved the living problems of some herdsmen. In the history of Kazakh production, this is also unprecedented. The poor herdsmen who had food to eat unanimously said: "We will not go hungry this winter, all thanks to Chairman Mao."

    Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of deceiving the people, and there was not a single school for the Kazakhs, and very few people were literate. After liberation, the People's Government was very concerned about the cultural cause of fraternal ethnic groups. In addition to running training classes, it also established eleven Kazakh primary schools in ten Kazakh townships and in Zhenxi City, and now there are 445 students (315 boys and 130 girls). Each school has established adult literacy classes, with 739 people participating in the study (313 men and 426 women); in addition, there are adult literacy groups, with 237 people participating in literacy. The total number of people participating in the above three items is 1,421, accounting for more than 13 percent of the total Kazakh population. Therefore, the Kazakh compatriots unanimously reflected: "The People's Government is thinking about us everywhere, and now we Kazakhs can also study and learn."

    In order to develop animal husbandry and further improve the lives of Kazakh herdsmen, the Zhenxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government convened a Kazakh Herdsmen Production Representatives Conference on April 23 this year, and formulated a patriotic production increase plan: this year, sheep production will increase by 11 percent, cattle production will increase by 8 percent, horse production will increase by 6 percent, and camel production will increase by 2 percent; on the basis of last year's agricultural production, it is guaranteed that 300 shi of seeds will be sown this year, and Kazakh compatriots will be organized to carry out handicraft production and develop transportation production.

    The above facts prove that the Communist Party and the People's Government are thinking about the happy lives of ethnic minority people everywhere, and only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government can the Kazakh people be completely liberated and obtain a free and happy life. This is already a truth well known by the vast number of fraternal ethnic groups.

    欣欣向荣的巴里坤草原上的哈萨克族牧民
    赵华生
    住在天山之北巴里坤草原上的一万零四百一十二个哈萨克族同胞，是一九五○年六月才得到解放的。因为自从一九四九年九月二十五日新疆宣布和平解放后不久，惯匪乌斯满就在美国间谍马克南指使下，欺骗、威胁广大哈族同胞进行叛乱。直到一九五○年六月，英勇的人民解放军消灭了当地的股匪，活捉了匪首贾尼木汗，巴里坤草原上的哈萨克族同胞才算真正得到了解放。
    解放两年来，中共新疆省镇西县委员会和县人民政府为了这一万多哈族同胞的解放事业所做的努力，是难以详述的。尤其是县委书记张晓，他以大部分精力用在牧区工作上；从哈萨克族靠拢人民政府的那一天起，就派出了工作队跟随哈萨克族同胞一起生活、工作。工作队的同志们冒着生命的危险，过着极其艰苦的生活，住不上房子，吃不上菜，但他们为了兄弟民族的解放事业、毫无怨言。他们一心一意为兄弟民族服务，现在他们已做出了辉煌的成绩，在兄弟民族解放事业的历史上写下了光荣的一页。这里不写他们如何领导群众协助人民解放军剿灭了土匪、安定了社会秩序，也不介绍他们如何艰苦地在牧区进行各项工作的情形，这里只就几个数目字来说明一条真理。
    解放初期，镇西县的一万多哈族同胞中，只有一个哈族干部，这是过去反动统治阶级为了收牧税方便，而派在税局工作的。解放后共产党和人民政府极其重视培养兄弟民族干部的工作，现在镇西县各级政府中已有副县长以下、乡文书以上脱离生产的干部五十六人；其中并有妇女干部二人，这在哈族历史上是稀有的事情。此外还有两个区十个乡的一百多乡政府的委员、六十六个村的村长，和各乡、村的妇女代表和小学教员。真正做到了牧民群众在建立政权时所歌唱的：“摧毁旧保甲，人民掌天下。”
    牧民赖以为生的是牲畜。解放前反动统治者只知道收牧税，不管牧民死活；解放后人民政府特别注意畜牧业的发展，并大力加以扶持，因此畜牧业得到迅速发展。如一九五一年原有羊十三万五千九百八十五只，当年就增殖四万八千二百九十六只，增加了百分之三十五强；原有牛五千三百四十五头，增殖一千四百○三头，增加了百分之二十六强；原有马一万三千五百三十四匹，增殖一千九百二十九匹，增加了百分之十四强；原有骆驼七千一百四十三头，增殖八百八十头，增加了将近百分之十二。一九五一年幼畜成活率是历史上最高的，所以牧民都感激地说：“有了共产党和毛主席，我们的畜牧业就发展了。”一九五一年部分哈萨克族人民还进行了农业生产，在政府的大力扶助和汉族农民的帮助下，春耕时，他们种了一百四十石六斗六升地，秋天收粮六百零六石六斗五升。还有一部分贫苦牧民进行了冬季副业生产，参加人数四百六十八人，组织了骆驼一千七百八十三头、马六十五匹、牛十头，获利折合小麦约二百三十二石一斗三升，解决了一部分牧民的生活问题。在哈萨克族生产历史上来说，这也是空前的。有了饭吃的贫苦牧民一致说：“今冬不挨饿，都是毛主席给咱们的好处。”
    解放前，国民党反动派实行愚民政策，哈族没有一个学校，识字的人很少。解放后人民政府非常关心兄弟民族的文化事业，除了开办训练班之外，又在十个哈族乡和镇西城里建立了十一所哈族小学，现在有学生四百四十五人（男三百一十五名，女一百三十名）。各学校都设立了成人识字班，参加学习的有七百三十九人（男三百一十三名、女四百二十六名）；另外还有成人识字小组，参加识字的有二百三十七人。以上三项共计参加学习的人数为一千四百二十一人，占全哈族人数的百分之十三强。因此哈族同胞一致反映：“人民政府处处为我们打算，现在我们哈族人也能念书学习了。”
    为了发展畜牧业，进一步提高哈族牧民生活，中共镇西县委员会和县人民政府又在今年四月二十三日召开了哈族牧民生产代表会议，订出爱国增产计划：今年羊增产百分之十一，牛增产百分之八，马增产百分之六，骆驼增产百分之二；农业生产在去年的基础上，保证今年播种三百石种子，组织哈族同胞进行手工业生产和发展运输生产。
    上述事实证明：共产党和人民政府，处处在为少数民族人民的幸福生活着想，也只有在共产党和人民政府的领导下，哈萨克族人民才能得到彻底解放，才能获得自由幸福的生活。这已经是广大兄弟民族人民所熟知的一条真理了。
