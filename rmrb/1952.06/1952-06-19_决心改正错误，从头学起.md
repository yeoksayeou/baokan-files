    Determined to Correct Mistakes and Start Anew
    Bai Ren
    Editor's Note: This newspaper and "Liberation Army Literature" and "Yangtze River Literature" have successively published criticisms of Bai Ren's novels "Fight Until Tomorrow" and "Target Right Ahead," and these criticisms are basically correct. Some readers who were once misled by these works have been educated. Comrade Bai Ren has also initially recognized his mistakes. We are now publishing his self-criticism as follows.
    The recent criticisms of my works in the newspapers and periodicals have played the role of "a loud shout," enabling me to deeply realize that in the depths of my soul, there is still a small bourgeois kingdom, and that there is a strong small bourgeois ideology in my creative thinking.
    This error is most prominent in my "Fight Until Tomorrow," which can serve as a mirror of my creative thinking. Therefore, I would like to examine my creative thinking and methods based on the errors in this novel.
    There have been detailed criticisms of "Fight Until Tomorrow," which have been very helpful to me, and I sincerely accept them. Here, I will only present a few of the main errors that I have initially recognized for self-criticism.
    In the winter of 1948, when I started writing this novel, I did want to use my life behind enemy lines to illustrate that intellectuals only have a future when they integrate with the working class and peasants. However, because I did not stand on the Party's position and use the proletariat's viewpoint, I naturally could not correctly write about the self-transformation of intellectuals, but could only, as Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "They create their works as self-expression of the petty bourgeoisie," and "show full sympathy for intellectuals from petty bourgeois backgrounds, even sympathizing with or even advocating the shortcomings of the petty bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's words hit me right in the bones. The group of intellectual cadres in the book are exactly myself and a group around me, and their shortcomings are exactly my own shortcomings. Instead of analyzing and criticizing these shortcomings from the proletariat's standpoint, I used the petty bourgeoisie's viewpoint, not to satirize, but to cover up and sympathize, even to advocate.
    To correctly express the theme of the integration of intellectuals with the workers and peasants, it is necessary to transform one's original non-proletarian ideology through the Party's training and education, and through tempering among the workers and peasants, learning from them, and establishing the example of working-class and peasant-oriented intellectuals, in order to point out the path of self-transformation for new intellectuals.
    The intellectuals depicted in the novel are not transformed in this way, but rather satirize theoretical study as "dogma" according to their own petty bourgeois way of thinking, disregard the Party's training and education, do not truly learn from the masses, but emphasize their own stumbling blocks and acceptance of so-called "lessons." They neither portray excellent worker-peasant cadres as role models for their learning, nor is it possible to transform their thinking well from the blindness of "stumbling blocks." Letting them go to the masses is not a real self-transformation, but rather to enable this group of petty bourgeois "heroes" to find a "place to use their talents." Thus, greatly publicizing and praising this group of untransformed intellectuals from petty bourgeois backgrounds.
    Standing on the petty bourgeoisie's position, everything, including love, hate, likes and dislikes, starts from the petty bourgeoisie's viewpoint, and a group of untransformed petty bourgeois intellectuals are written as the protagonists of the novel. Instead of truly writing about their process of transforming from the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie is used to replace the proletariat's leadership, and they are written as the masters of history and the actual commanders of the war. All the worker-peasant cadres and soldiers, and the peasant masses in the base areas, revolve around them, brought out to join in the fun when needed, and kicked aside when not needed, never to be seen again. All the battle plots and events are arranged for them. In this way, the novel naturally produced a series of serious errors.
    In the novel, not only can we not see the Party's transformation of this group of intellectuals, but even when they serve as the Party representatives (political instructors) of the company, we cannot see how much Party activity they carry out. The only branch committee meeting that appears in the hospital is also written as a complete mess.
    When writing about the worker-peasant cadres and the masses, it is exactly as Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "In some respects, they also love the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and also love the cadres from worker, peasant, and soldier backgrounds, but sometimes they don't love them, and in some places they don't love them, they don't love their feelings, they don't love their postures." These words also hit me right in the bones. Isn't that exactly what the worker-peasant cadres and the broad masses depicted in the novel are like? It is written that worker-peasant cadre Wang Chuan is conscientious and responsible in his work, and has principles, but the intellectuals' mouths are used to say that he is inferior to them in every way. Throughout the book, he is always the superior of this group of intellectuals, and also represents the Party's leader, but it cannot be seen what role he plays in their transformation and education. On the one hand, it is written that worker-peasant cadres Zheng Darong and Zhang Desheng are brave and good at fighting, but on the other hand, it is said that they are undisciplined. On the one hand, it is said that Zhang Guoping is brave in battle, but on the other hand, it is said that he is personally brave. In some battles, it is written that the soldiers and militiamen are brave in battle, but in other battles, the logistics personnel and militiamen are written as very embarrassed. The head of the village and the chairman of the women's association in the base areas are written as very lovable, but the migrant workers in the new areas are written as very selfish. … On the contrary, when writing about intellectual cadres, although it is verbally admitted that they are not as good as them, they are actually superior to them in every way, even distorting worker-peasant cadres and the masses, creating so-called "lessons," to educate—actually, to create capital for praising—petty bourgeois intellectual cadres.
    The petty bourgeois ideology and the bourgeois ideology are not only close, but sometimes intertwined. The novel not only has serious ideological errors, but also has serious political errors.
    The "Bloody Battle of Tianmen Peak" in the novel is based on my short story "The Death of Squad Leader Xin" written in 1944. There was no "fake surrender" in the original, but in order to compare it with Xin Weiqun being arrested later and the enemy persuading him to sign a repentance letter to "fake surrender," which Xin resolutely refused to do, to show that he was "clever" in annihilating the enemy, the so-called "using a trick within a trick" "fake surrender" was forcibly added. At that time, it was also realized that it was not very appropriate, but starting from the petty bourgeoisie's position, not only could one not distinguish between right and wrong and be alert to serious political errors, but one also found reasons to defend oneself: "It's not pulling the troops to the enemy's side, but tricking the enemy to annihilate them, the effect is good!" Little did I know that this is fundamentally impossible. And even more absurdly, in order to make the reason more sufficient, I arrogantly distorted the meaning, quoted "On Protracted War" and used "war is deception" as an explanation, thus seriously distorting the heroic qualities of our army and distorting Chairman Mao's brilliant military thinking.
    Chapter 12 of the novel more fully exposes that I not only deviated from the standpoint of the working class, but also failed to stand firm on the national standpoint. On the one hand, the Japanese Kou squadron leader who represented the Japanese aggressors was written as a beast who killed and set fires, but on the other hand, he was written as having war-weariness; it was said that he had received higher education, had inner distress after burning and killing, and "seemed to have a conscience reproaching" when raping. Isn't this openly defending the Japanese Kou's bestial behavior? Isn't this bourgeois humanism?
    Incorrect creative thinking cannot have correct creative methods, and the two are also inextricably linked.
    Another error in the content of the novel is that it caters to the backward tastes of the petty bourgeoisie, uses bizarre and thrilling stories, uses boring love plots, and uses low-level and vulgar tastes to attract readers.
    A novel with poor and erroneous ideological content is thus piled up with tastes and stories.
    On the one hand, there is the bold fabrication of stories, but on the other hand, it cannot get rid of the methods of naturalism. Much of what is written in the book is mostly trivial matters and one-sided experiences in one's own small circle and around, plus what one has seen and heard. Because one does not stand on the Party's position, one cannot correctly criticize and choose, so they are piled together. Starting from the petty bourgeoisie's thoughts, feelings, and tastes, everything that conforms to the essence of the laws of life is considered plain and unremarkable; but one is obsessed with pursuing tortuous stories and vulgar tastes, pursuing a set of things loved by the petty bourgeoisie.
    Brandishing the transformation of intellectuals, but actually peddling petty bourgeois goods, the characters are neither typical characters, nor is the background of the times a typical environment, and many events violate the truth of life, taking many superficial phenomena as the essence. With this approach, it is impossible to see the epitome of our army's heroic resistance against Japan behind enemy lines, to see Chairman Mao's brilliant military thinking, and to see the true face of our heroic troops from the novel.
    Tracing the source of the errors, it is because one's original petty bourgeois ideology has not been fundamentally and practically transformed for a long time. After entering the city, I also accepted the influence of bourgeois and petty bourgeois artistic thoughts, so that I could not draw a clear line, could not distinguish between right and wrong, and produced serious errors in creative thinking.
    First of all, there is an error in position and viewpoint, which will produce such a seriously erroneous work. Because I deviated from the Party's and the working class's position and looked at problems from the petty bourgeoisie's viewpoint, I could not see the Party's and the superior's transforming effect on intellectuals, so I would distort worker-peasant cadres and the troops, and distort the historical truth. But in reality, this is not the case. The reason why I was able to embark on the revolution, be able to do some work in the revolutionary ranks, and even be able to write something, is all the result of the Party's and the superior's painstaking cultivation day and night, and also the result of the help and education of comrades and the worker-peasant masses. But when I used the little ability cultivated by the Party to write about the self-transformation of intellectuals (also myself), I forgot all about the Party's and the superior's contributions, and said that it was the result of self-struggle. What a serious idea of forgetting one's roots this is!
    Impure creative motives are another reason for the errors. Before and after joining the revolution, I constantly studied and wrote some poems, newsletters, and novels. In 1948, when I was working as a journalist full-time, I took time to write a few short stories. At first, it was just regarded as practicing writing, but later I thought that since I was going to specialize in literary work, I should make a "big name" and create a brand for myself. If I became famous and had a position, the leaders would no longer ask me to do administrative work. It was under this corrupt individualistic intention of wanting to create capital for myself and bargain with the organization that I began writing "Fight Until Tomorrow." At first, I wanted to write about a company's heroic battle behind enemy lines. After entering the customs, I saw a large number of new intellectuals pouring into the troops; and I thought that the whole country would soon be liberated, and the readers of the novel would mainly be intellectuals. It was under the command of the bad idea of catering to petty bourgeois readers for myself that I threw "First, for the workers, peasants, and soldiers" behind my head and put "Second, only for the petty bourgeoisie" in front, changing the theme. This is clearly a bias towards petty bourgeois intellectuals, but I insisted on finding a reason to defend myself: "The first time I write a novel, I should write about what I am most familiar with." (The so-called "what I am most familiar with" is that set of thoughts and feelings of petty bourgeois intellectuals.) This reason just defends "taking creation as self-expression." Starting from the petty bourgeoisie's position to consider my own fame and status, how can I stand on the correct position to write about the transformation of intellectuals? So I had to fill the work with my so-called "experiences and lessons," some of my experiences, and my petty bourgeois way of thinking. How could that not be wrong?
    Thinking about it today, at that time, my ideological level and artistic level were not sufficient to write such a complex novel. However, the thought of eagerness for quick success and individual heroism was supporting myself. So, relying on half-baked theories, relying on one-sided experiences and materials that had not been analyzed and criticized, I mustered up the courage, worked day and night, and wrote a lot. As a result, like a commander who fought a reckless battle, I was bound to be bruised and battered!
    Individual heroism is not only manifested in the work, but also in the writing attitude, in pretending to understand what one does not understand, and in learning. My own theoretical level is not high, but my complacency in politics is very serious. I think that I have been doing editing and administrative work for a long time and have not made any big mistakes, so it is probably "enough" to be a literary worker. I took ideological work too simply, so I did not seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The attitude towards life is also like this. I think that I have been working in the company for a long time and have the "capital" to write a lot, so I am not willing to go further into life, to work hard to transform my thinking, which led to this serious error.
    Since I thought that what I lacked was not politics, I desperately drilled into skills. I was not satisfied with modern works, and I was obsessed with classical masterpieces. Because my position was unstable, I uncritically accepted non-proletarian things, coupled with the deeply rooted influence of old Chinese novels since childhood, I was satisfied with my petty bourgeois feelings and tastes. In addition, after entering the customs, I heard a theory—saying that the works in the liberated areas were dry, with bones but no flesh, the characters were unclear, and the stories were single-lined. I did not pay attention to this fallacy of bourgeois and petty bourgeois literary thoughts attacking proletarian thoughts, so I tried my best to work on the form, and as for the content, I did not consider it much. This is also one of the reasons for the errors. I am grateful to the Party and the superiors for their training and education, and I am grateful to the comrades for their criticisms, so that I can continue to move forward. I regret the mistakes I have made, but I am determined to throw away all the rotten baggage that hinders progress, humbly start from scratch, seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and wholeheartedly and unconditionally participate in the heated struggle for a long time, and complete the correction of errors and the transformation of thinking as a glorious task!

    决心改正错误，从头学起
    白刃
    编者按：本报和“解放军文艺”“长江文艺”先后发表了对白刃所作小说“战斗到明天”“目标正前方”的批评，这些批评基本上是正确的。一些曾被这些作品所迷惑的读者受到了教育。白刃同志也初步认识了自己的错误。现在把他的检讨发表如下。
    最近报刊对我的作品的批评，是起了“大喝一声”的作用，使我深刻地认识到，自己灵魂的深处，仍然是个小资产阶级的王国，自己创作思想中，存在着浓厚的小资产阶级的思想意识。
    这种错误，在我的“战斗到明天”里，表现得最为突出，它可以作为我的创作思想的一面镜子，因此我想从这部小说的错误，来检讨我的创作思想和创作方法。
    对“战斗到明天”，已有了详细的批评，这些批评对我的帮助很大，我诚恳接受。这里，仅据我初步的认识，提出几个主要的错误作检讨。
    一九四八年冬天，开始写这部小说的时候，确曾想根据自己在敌后的生活，来说明知识分子只有与工农大众相结合，才有前途。但因为没有站在党的立场，用无产阶级的观点，自然不能正确写出知识分子的自我改造，而只能像毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中所说的：“他们是把自己的作品当作小资产阶级的自我表现来创作的”，“对于小资产阶级出身的知识分子寄与满腔的同情，连小资产阶级的缺点也加以同情甚至鼓吹”。毛主席这些话，正说到我的骨子里。书中的一群知识分子干部，正是自己和周围的一群，他们的缺点，正是自己的缺点。对这些缺点，不是站在无产阶级的立场上加以分析批判，而是用小资产阶级的观点，不是挖苦讽刺，就是掩饰同情，甚至鼓吹。
    正确表现知识分子与工农结合的主题，应该通过党的培养教育，通过工农群众中的锻炼，向他们学习，从而改造了自己原有非无产阶级的思想意识，树立了工农化知识分子的榜样，才能给新知识分子指出自我改造的途径。
    小说中表现的知识分子，不是这样的改造，而是按照自己小资产阶级的思想方法，讽刺理论学习为“教条”，无视党的培养教育，没有真正向群众学习，而是强调自己碰钉子接受所谓的“教训”。既没有写出优秀的工农干部作为他们的学习榜样，也不可能从盲目性的“碰钉子”中改造好思想。让他们到群众中去，不是真正的去自我改造，而是使这群小资产阶级的“英雄”，找到“用武之地”。于是大大地宣扬歌颂这一群没有改造的小资产阶级出身的知识分子。
    站在小资产阶级的立场，一切爱憎好恶从小资产阶级的观点出发，把一群没有改造好的小资产阶级的知识分子，写成小说的主人翁。不是真正写出他们从小资产阶级转变到无产阶级的过程，而是以小资产阶级代替无产阶级的领导，把他们写成历史的主人翁，战争的实际指挥者。一切工农干部和战士，根据地的农民群众都围着他们转，需要的时候拉出来凑热闹，不需要的时候一脚踢开，再也不见影子。一切战斗情节事件，都是为他们安排的。这样，自然就使得小说产生了一系列的严重错误。
    小说里面不但看不到党对这群知识分子的改造，就是连他们作为连队的党代表（指导员）时，也看不到进行多少党的活动。唯一出现的医院里一次支委会，也写得一团糟。
    写到工农干部和群众，也正如毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中所说的：“在某些方面也爱工农兵，也爱工农兵出身的干部，但有些时候不爱，有些地方不爱，不爱他们的感情，不爱他们的姿态。”这些话也正说到我的骨子里。小说中所描写的工农干部和广大群众，不正是这样吗？写工农干部王川工作认真负责，有原则性，又用知识分子的嘴，说他处处不如他们。在全书中，他始终是这群知识分子的上级，也是代表党的领导者，但看不见他对他们的改造教育，起了什么作用。一面写工农干部郑大荣和张德胜英勇善战，一面说他们无组织无纪律。一面说章国平打仗勇敢，一面说他是个人勇敢。在一些战斗中，写战士们和民兵打仗勇敢，又在另一些战斗中，把勤杂人员和民兵写得很狼狈。把根据地的庄长和妇救会长写得很可爱，又把新区的民工写得很自私。……相反的，写到知识分子干部的时候，虽然口头上承认不如他们，而实际上是处处比他们优越，甚至用歪曲工农干部和群众，制造所谓“教训”，来教育——实际上是为歌颂作资本——小资产阶级知识分子干部。
    小资产阶级的思想和资产阶级的思想不但接近，有时候还交错不清，小说中不但有严重的思想错误，并且有严重的政治错误。
    小说中的“血战天门顶”，是根据我一九四四年的短篇小说“辛排长之死”写成的。原作中并没有什么“假投降”，但为了和后面辛为群被捕后，敌人劝他在悔过书上签字“假投降”，辛坚决不上当作对比，说明他“机智”歼敌，硬在敌人劝降时，加进一段所谓“将计就计”的“假投降”。当时也曾意识到不大妥当，但从小资产阶级的立场出发，不但不能分辨是非，警惕到严重的政治错误，反而替自己找到辩护的理由：“既不是把部队拉到敌人那里，而是把敌人骗来歼灭，效果不错嘛！”殊不知这是根本不可能的事。而更荒谬的是为着使理由更充足，狂妄地断章取义，引用了“论持久战”中的“兵不厌诈”作解释，因而严重地歪曲了我军的英雄品质，歪曲了毛主席英明的军事思想。
    小说第十二章中，更充分地暴露了自己不但脱离了工人阶级的立场，连民族立场也没有站稳。一面把代表日本侵略者的日寇中队长写成杀人放火的野兽，一面却写他有厌战情绪；说他受过高等教育，在烧杀之后有内心苦闷，在奸淫之时“似乎良心在责备”。这不是公开替日寇的兽行作辩护吗？这不是资产阶级的人性论吗？
    错误的创作思想，不可能有正确的创作方法，两者也是有血肉难分的关系的。
    小说内容的另一错误是迎合了小资产阶级的落后趣味，用离奇惊险的故事，用无聊恋爱的情节，用低级庸俗趣味，来吸引读者。
    思想内容贫乏和错误的小说，就是这样依靠趣味加上故事堆砌起来的。
    一面是大胆的编造故事，一面却脱离不了自然主义的手法。书中写的许多东西，大部分是自己小圈子里和周围的生活琐事和片面经验，加上自己所见所闻的。因为没有站在党的立场上，便不能正确地批判和取舍，就堆在一起，从小资产阶级的思想感情和趣味出发，把合乎生活规律的本质的东西，一概认为平淡无奇；却一味去追求曲折的故事和庸俗的趣味，追求一套小市民心爱的东西。
    标榜着知识分子的改造，实际上却在贩卖小资产阶级的货色，人物既不是典型人物，时代背景又非典型环境，许多事件又违反了生活真实，把许多表面现象当成本质。这样作法，想从小说中看到我军在敌后英勇抗战的缩影，看到毛主席英明的军事思想，看到我们英雄部队的真实面貌，那是不可能的。
    追寻错误的根源，乃是自己原有的小资产阶级的思想意识，长期没有根本的切实的改造的缘故。入城以后，又接受了资产阶级、小资产阶级的艺术思想的影响，以致划不清界限，分不清是非，产生了创作思想的严重错误。
    首先是立场观点有错误，才会产生这样一部严重错误的作品。由于脱离了党的、工人阶级的立场，用小资产阶级的观点看问题，所以看不见党和上级领导对知识分子的改造作用，所以会歪曲工农干部和部队，歪曲了历史的真实。而实际上并不是这样，我自己所以能走上革命，能在革命队伍里做点工作，甚至能写点东西，无一不是党和上级日夜苦心培养的结果，也无一不是同志们和工农群众帮助教育的结果。但当自己用党培养出来的一点本事，写知识分子（也是自己）自我改造的时候，却把党和上级的功劳，忘得干干净净，而说是自我奋斗的结果，这是何等严重的忘本思想！
    创作动机不纯，是产生错误的另一个原因。参加革命前后，我曾不断学习写点诗歌、通讯和小说。一九四八年，专门作记者工作的时候，抽空写几个短篇小说。开头不过当作练习写作，后来想到既要专事文学工作，应该搞出点“大名堂”，替自己创个牌子。成了名有了地位，领导上再不会叫我作行政工作。就是在这种腐朽的个人主义的、想替自己制造资本和组织上讲价钱的意图下，开始了“战斗到明天”的写作。起先是想写一个连队在敌后英勇作战。入关以后，看到大批新知识分子涌入部队；又想到全国快解放了，长篇小说的读者主要还是知识分子。就是在为自己迎合小资产阶级读者的坏思想的支使下，把“第一是为着工农兵”扔在脑后，把“第二才是为着小资产阶级”摆在前面，改变了主题。这分明是对小资产阶级知识分子的偏爱，却偏替自己找到辩护的理由：“第一次写长篇，应该写自己最熟悉的东西。”（所谓“自己最熟悉的东西”就是小资产阶级知识分子那一套思想感情。）这个理由又正好替“把创作当成自我表现”作辩护。一开始就退到小资产阶级的立场上，来考虑自己的名利地位，怎么能站在正确的立场上来写知识分子的改造呢？于是只好把自己所谓“经验教训”，自己的一些经历，自己小资产阶级的思想方法，充塞到作品中，那能不错呢？
    今天想起来，当时写这样复杂的长篇小说，无论是思想水平或艺术水平，都不够条件。但是急于求成和个人英雄主义的思想，却在支持着自己。于是凭一知半解的理论，凭着片面的经验及没有经过分析批判的材料，鼓起勇气，日夜开工，大写特写。结果和一个打莽撞仗的指挥员一样，必然碰得头破血流！
    个人英雄主义不仅表现在作品中，也表现在写作态度上，表现在不懂装懂上，表现在学习上。自己理论水平不高，而政治上自满情绪却很严重，认为自己长期做编辑工作和行政工作，没有出过大岔子，做一个文艺工作者大概“够了”。把思想工作看得太简单，因而没有认真地学习马列主义和毛泽东思想。对待生活态度也是如此，认为自己长期在连队工作过，有“资本”可以大写特写，因而不肯进一步深入地去生活，刻苦地去改造思想，以致发生了这严重的错误。
    既然认为缺乏的不是政治，于是拚命地钻技巧。现代作品看了不过瘾，醉心于古典名著。由于立场不稳，就无批判地接受了非无产阶级的东西，加上从小受到中国旧小说根深柢固的影响，满足于自己小资产阶级的感情趣味。再加上入关以后，听见一种论调——说解放区的作品干巴巴，有骨无肉，人物不明朗，故事单线条。自己对这种资产阶级和小资产阶级的文艺思想向无产阶级思想进攻的谬论，没有加以警惕，于是尽量在形式上下功夫，至于内容，就考虑的不多。这也是产生错误的原因之一。感谢党和上级的培养教育，感谢同志们的批评，使我能继续前进。犯了错误，痛悔无及，唯有决心丢掉一切障碍前进的烂包袱，虚心地从头学起，认真的学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，全心全意无条件地长期参加火热斗争，把纠正错误改造思想，当成光荣任务来完成！
