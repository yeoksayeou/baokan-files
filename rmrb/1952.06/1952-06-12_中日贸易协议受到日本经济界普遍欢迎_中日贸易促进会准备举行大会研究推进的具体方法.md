Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 11th: The Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed in Beijing on June 1st has been generally welcomed by Japanese economic circles.

On the day the agreement was signed, the Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Promotion Association, Suzuki, stated that the signing of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement at least pointed out a bright future for Sino-Japanese trade, which had been stagnant until today. He also believed that Japanese traders would welcome an agreement like the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. On the 2nd, the China-Japan Trade Promotion Association decided to support the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and would call on representatives of all member companies of the association to participate in a conference to be held in the near future to jointly study specific methods for advancing the Sino-Japanese trade plan.

The Japanese textile industry, which is in a state of severe depression, is particularly excited about the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 3rd, the Japanese textile industry expressed its approval of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. If they were allowed to "export" even a small portion of their goods to China, their situation would be much better.

More and more people are demanding the resumption of trade with China. The "Oil and Fat Manufacturers Association," an organization of Japanese oil manufacturers, made a suggestion in May advocating the launch of a movement demanding that the Japanese government resume trade with China as soon as possible. This suggestion has been accepted by the "Japan Iron and Steel Federation," an organization of Japanese steel traders, and they will jointly launch this movement. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 8th acknowledged: "The widespread depression in the world (referring to the capitalist world) has a very serious impact on Japan, and the hope of recovery is very slim." The Chinese market, which was once the largest source of income for Japanese merchants, "strongly attracts them." The newspaper expressed dissatisfaction that the United States continued to use U.S. laws to prohibit Japan from trading with China after the entry into force of the separate treaty, saying: "Japan's recently acquired independence seems to be only nominal." "It would be foolish for Japan, as an independent country, to continue to enforce the embargo imposed during the occupation."

The widespread impact of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in Japan has caused panic among the American occupiers, who are trying to interfere with and undermine the restoration and development of Sino-Japanese trade in order to keep the Japanese economy under American control. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Murphy openly slandered the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the three Japanese representatives who signed the agreement through the U.S. military newspaper "Pacific Stars and Stripes" on the 7th and the dinner party held by the Japanese "Federation of Economic Organizations" on the same day. At the same time, Murphy blatantly suggested that Japan use the method of "rewarding the absorption of foreign private capital" to improve Japan's "competitive position" in the world market, and shamelessly said: "In the past seven years of occupation, the United States has provided Japan with more than 2 billion U.S. dollars in aid to help Japan's industry recover." He also advocated that Japan continue to pin its hopes on this type of dollar income. However, everyone knows that it is precisely because of these U.S. "aid" that Japan's peaceful industries have gone bankrupt and Japan's economy has been controlled by the United States. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" had already issued a call on May 6th that Japan must break free from the shackles of U.S. "aid." The newspaper called U.S. "aid" "political dollar income," saying that this "political dollar income" is not "a blessing," which is why Japan's national economy is "precarious and deformed." The "Mainichi Shimbun" emphasized that from now on, Japan should strive to make its national economy independent and autonomous.

### 中日贸易协议受到日本经济界普遍欢迎  中日贸易促进会准备举行大会研究推进的具体方法

    中日贸易协议受到日本经济界普遍欢迎
    中日贸易促进会准备举行大会研究推进的具体方法
    【新华社十一日讯】东京消息：六月一日在北京签订的中日贸易协议，受到日本经济界的普遍欢迎。
    在协议签字的当天，中日贸易促进会理事长铃木就表示：中日贸易协议的签字至少给直到今天毫无起色的中日贸易指出了光明的前途。他并认为：像中日贸易协议这样的协议，日本贸易商都是很欢迎的。二日，中日贸易促进会决定支持中日贸易协议，并将号召所有该会会员公司的代表参加在短期内准备举行的大会，共同研究推进中日贸易计划的具体方法。
    陷于严重的萧条状况的日本纺织业，对中日贸易协议特别感到兴奋。据共同社东京三日讯，日本纺织业对中日贸易协议表示赞同。如果准许他们把货物向中国“输出即使一小部分，他们的光景也会好得多”。
    愈来愈多的人在要求恢复与中国的贸易。日本制油商的组织“油脂制造业会”曾在五月间提出建议，主张发动要求日本政府早日与中国恢复贸易的运动，这个建议已为日本钢铁商的组织“日本钢铁联盟”所接受，它们将联合发动这个运动。八日的“读卖新闻”承认：“目前世界（按指资本主义世界）的广泛的不景气对日本有很严重的影响，恢复的希望非常渺茫。”一度是日本商人的最大收入的中国市场，“强烈地吸引着他们。”该报不满在单独和约生效之后美国继续利用美国的法令禁止日本与中国进行贸易，它说：“日本最近获得的独立似乎只是名义上的独立。”“如果作为一个独立国家的日本仍然奉行占领时间制订的禁运令，那真是愚蠢极了。”
    中日贸易协议在日本所产生的广大影响，引起美国占领者的恐慌，他们力图干涉和破坏中日贸易的恢复与发展，以便使日本经济继续处于美国的控制之下。美国驻日大使墨菲通过七日的美军报纸“太平洋星条报”和同日日本“经济团体联合会”举行的晚餐会，公开污蔑中日贸易协议和在协议上签字的三位日本代表。同时，墨菲公然建议日本用“奖励吸收外国的私人资本”的办法来改善日本在世界市场上的“竞争地位”，并且恬不知耻地说：“在过去七年的占领期间，美国给日本的援助有二十多亿美元，以协助日本工业恢复起来。”他并鼓吹日本继续把希望寄托在这类的美元收入上。但是，谁都知道，正是由于这些美“援”，使日本的和平工业破产，使日本的经济为美国所控制。日本资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”早在五月六日也发出了日本必须挣脱美“援”的羁绊的呼声。该报把美“援”称为“政治美元收入”，它说：这种“政治美元收入”不是“一种福祉”，这便是为什么日本的国民经济是“岌岌可危而且畸形”的原因。“每日新闻”强调说：从今以后，日本应该努力使国民经济独立自主。
