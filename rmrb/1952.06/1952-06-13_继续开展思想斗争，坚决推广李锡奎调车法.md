Continue to Carry Out Ideological Struggle and Resolutely Promote the Li Xikui Shunting Method

In the process of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, it has been filled with the struggle between new and old ideas from beginning to end. Where the old ideas prevailed, the Li Xikui shunting method could not be promoted; but when the old ideas were criticized, the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method could proceed smoothly.

When the Central Ministry of Railways decided to promote the Li Xikui shunting method nationwide, some cadres said, "We have our own shunting method, why bother promoting Li Xikui's?" Some leading cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Administration believed that the Cui Xiufeng shunting method of the Qiqihar Station was not bad, and there was no need to promote the Li Xikui shunting method. They felt that "Promoting our own is always better than promoting someone else's." They promoted the Cui Xiufeng shunting method, which resulted in failure. They reviewed this departmentalism and concentrated all their efforts on promoting the Li Xikui shunting method, and also had Cui Xiufeng study the Li Xikui shunting method and take the lead in promoting it. Before long, the main stations under the administration all implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, and the shunting efficiency increased by 26.5%. Some cadres of the Tianjin Railway Administration also wanted to use their own Mei Zhongsan shunting method to replace the Li Xikui shunting method, and some station masters even said, "Let's do a set first to show them." They did indeed do a set, but this set was not able to reform the shunting work, but instead delayed the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method. To this day, the Tianjin Railway Administration still has 78 shunting teams that have not implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, but the stations that have implemented the Li Xikui shunting method have increased production efficiency by 50%. These facts have educated those who have departmentalist ideas and are unwilling to implement the Li Xikui shunting method. They now admit, "The Li Xikui shunting method is indeed good."

However, after these departmentalist ideas were just overcome, another argument came out: "The Li Xikui shunting method is good, but we can't implement it here." They used various excuses to refuse to promote the Li Xikui shunting method. They said, "Li Xikui's equipment is good, and our equipment is poor, how can we use his method?" When the station master of Nanxingqiao Station of Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau heard that the Li Xikui shunting method was to be implemented, he shouted, "That won't work! Our lines are too bad." Not many days after he said this, Sun Xifu, a shunter at this station, followed Li Xikui's method, contacted the driver well, and scientifically grasped the time, and realized Li Xikui's continuous coasting method on the inclined line. When the station master saw this fact, he had to admit that his view was "too conservative." In the early stage of implementing the Li Xikui shunting method, the Suihua Station in Northeast China also emphasized that their locomotives were not good and could not meet the requirements for promoting the Li Xikui shunting method; but after they implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, their locomotives became easier to use and saved a locomotive. It can be seen from this that the statement that the Li Xikui shunting method cannot be promoted due to poor equipment is incorrect, and it does not understand that the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method is to solve the problem of poor equipment. The reason why they said this is only to show that they are unwilling to promote the Li Xikui shunting method. When Chang'an Station implemented the line system of the Li Xikui shunting method, it encountered the difficulty of having few tracks. The station master discussed with the workers, held a seven-day meeting, and decided to take the method of using the tracks flexibly, and finally overcame the difficulty of having few tracks and implemented the line system. This shows that the Li Xikui shunting method can still be promoted in the case of poor equipment.

Some cadres also believe that "The employees of the China Changchun Railway have good technology and can fully implement the Li Xikui shunting method; our employees here have low technology, how can we implement it?" This statement is obviously incorrect. The promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method is precisely to improve the technical level of employees, and the problem of low employee technology can only be solved in the process of implementing the Li Xikui shunting method. After learning the Li Xikui shunting method, the shunters in many stations said happily, "From now on, we have a way to work!" Dou Baoshan, a connecting worker at Suihua Station, used to be unable to do a good job in shunting work because of his poor skills. After he adopted the Li Xikui shunting method, he improved the shunting efficiency. He said, "Now it is easier and safer to work." Some cadres of Hengyang Railway Administration and Zhengzhou Railway Administration are still afraid of "low employee technology" and dare not boldly implement the Li Xikui shunting method. It is time for them to change their views.

Some railway leaders used to worry that "It is not safe to implement Li Xikui's continuous coasting method." Director Liu of the Supervisory Office of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau thought that "Implementing the continuous coasting method will violate the safety system." Some station masters of the Hengyang Railway Administration said, "If we coast continuously, safety cannot be guaranteed." Wu Zhenqing, the station master of Matou Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, was afraid of accidents and even criticized the shunters for not implementing the continuous coasting method. These concerns are completely unfounded. For more than a year, Li Xikui has implemented the continuous coasting method, and there has never been any accident. In fact, the main function of the Li Xikui shunting method is to ensure safety and improve efficiency. Some cadres saw that the Li Xikui shunting method was a new thing that negated the old working methods, and thought that it was not safe to not follow the old rules. Their conservative thinking has been shattered by iron facts. Director Liu of the Supervisory Office of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau once visited Cui Xiufeng's performance of the Li Xikui shunting method. He saw that Cui Xiufeng implemented the continuous coasting method and made eighteen hitches in eighteen minutes, which doubled the work efficiency without any accidents. He admitted that his past views were wrong, and he said, "Continuous coasting will not cause accidents."

Those who emphasize "poor equipment," "low technology," and "unsafe" and do not actively promote the Li Xikui shunting method have been educated in the face of living facts. They have realized that their thinking is backward, and they have not seen that the conditions for promoting the Li Xikui shunting method have matured. It is precisely because of criticizing this conservative thinking that the work of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method in these stations has achieved results.

However, many facts have not finally convinced those with conservative ideas, and these wrong ideas have reappeared in disguise, which is the lack of the spirit of collectivism. Cadres with this kind of thinking believe:
	"Promoting the Li Xikui shunting method is a matter for the transportation department, and it has nothing to do with me." Therefore, the train section and the locomotive section cannot cooperate well, the inspection section and the train section lack contact, and uncoordinated phenomena have also occurred between the transportation departments. This kind of thinking seriously hinders the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method. The Jiamusi Locomotive Depot in Northeast China arbitrarily changed locomotives from the perspective of its own department's interests, and changed locomotives 21 times in a month, which fundamentally violated the principle of fixing locomotives and hindered the work of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method. At Wuchang Station, shunters and switchmen were not convinced of each other, which caused derailment and derailment accidents. In many areas, the shift exchange time between the locomotive section and the train section is inconsistent, which affects the work of shunters and drivers; and the cadres of the locomotive section only consider their own convenience and are unwilling to change the time. As a result, some shunters often delay their work for up to an hour waiting for the driver to hand over the shift. Hangzhou Station and the inspection section are not well connected, which prolongs the technical operation time. All these phenomena show that the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method is by no means a simple matter for the transportation department, but a common task for all relevant departments. The railway is a huge linkage machine, and no department is isolated, and must cooperate and contact each other. Departmentalism that only cares about oneself and does not care about others is opposed to the collective nature of the railway. This kind of thinking should be resolutely opposed. Otherwise, the work of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method will also fail. Some areas have consciously overcome this kind of thinking and established joint labor organizations of relevant departments, and thus successfully promoted the Li Xikui shunting method. Meihekou Station, Meihekou Locomotive Depot, and Inspection Depot in Northeast China hold joint labor meetings on a regular basis to carry out criticism and self-criticism, solve the problem of incoordination, and avoid several delay accidents. Zhengzhou Station and Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot implemented joint labor, which also solved the contradiction between shunters and drivers in their work.

As mentioned above, the process of promoting the Li Xikui shunting method is the process of carrying out ideological struggle. At present, to deeply promote the Li Xikui shunting method, it is still necessary to continue to carry out ideological struggle and strengthen ideological leadership. Areas that have not implemented the Li Xikui shunting method should quickly criticize various erroneous ideas that hinder the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method. Only in this way can we do a good job in promoting the Li Xikui shunting method.

### 继续开展思想斗争，坚决推广李锡奎调车法

    继续开展思想斗争，坚决推广李锡奎调车法
    在李锡奎调车法的推广过程中，自始至终充满着新旧思想的斗争。那个地方旧的思想占了上风，李锡奎调车法就推广不起来；而当旧的思想受到了批判，李锡奎调车法的推广工作就能顺利进行。
    当中央铁道部决定在全国推广李锡奎调车法的时候，有些干部说：“我们自己有调车法，何必推广李锡奎的呢？”齐齐哈尔铁路管理局有些领导干部认为齐齐哈尔车站的崔秀峰调车法也不坏，不必推广李锡奎调车法。他们觉得：“推广自己的，总比推广别人的强。”他们推广了崔秀峰调车法，结果失败了。他们检讨了这种本位主义思想，集中全力推广李锡奎调车法，并且让崔秀峰学习了李锡奎调车法，带头推广。不久，该局所属主要车站都推行了李锡奎调车法，调车效率提高了百分之二十六点五。天津铁路管理局有些干部也想用自己的梅仲三调车法来代替李锡奎调车法，某些站长还说：“我们先搞一套给人家瞧瞧。”他们的确搞了一套，但这一套并没有能够改革调车工作，反而把推广李锡奎调车法的工作推迟了。天津铁路管理局到今天还有七十八个调车组没有实行李锡奎调车法，但实行了李锡奎调车法的车站，都把生产效率提高了百分之五十。这些事实，教育了那些有着本位主义思想、不愿实行李锡奎调车法的人们。他们现在已经承认：“李锡奎调车法的确是好。”
    但是，这些本位主义思想刚被克服以后，又出来另一种论调：“李锡奎调车法好是好，但是我们这里实行不了。”他们用种种藉口拒绝推行李锡奎调车法。他们说：“李锡奎他们的设备好，我们的设备差，怎能用他的方法呢？”杭州铁路分局南星桥车站站长听说要实行李锡奎调车法，他就嚷道：“那可不行！我们的线路太差。”他说这句话没有几天，这个车站的调车员孙喜福就按照李锡奎的办法，很好地和司机联系，科学地掌握时间，在有坡道的线路上，实现了李锡奎的连续溜放法。这个车站站长看见了这个事实，不得不承认他的看法“太保守了”。东北绥化车站在实行李锡奎调车法的初期，还强调他们的机车不行，不能满足推广李锡奎调车法的要求；但在他们实行了李锡奎调车法以后，他们的机车好用了，而且节省了一台机车。由此可见：强调设备不好而不推行李锡奎调车法的说法，是不对的，是不了解推广李锡奎调车法，就是为了解决设备不好的问题。他们所以这样说，只不过说明他们不愿推广李锡奎调车法而已。长安车站在实行李锡奎调车法的包线制时，发生了股道少的困难。车站站长找工人商量，开了七天会，决定采取活用股道的办法，终于克服了股道少的困难，实行了包线制。这就说明了在设备不好的情况下，还是可以推广李锡奎调车法的。
    有些干部还认为：“中长铁路员工的技术好，可以全面实行李锡奎调车法；我们这里的员工技术低，那能实行？”这种说法显然也是不对的。推广李锡奎调车法，正是为了提高员工的技术水平，而员工技术低的问题，也只有在实行李锡奎调车法的过程中才能解决。许多车站的调车员，学习了李锡奎调车法以后，都眉飞色舞地说道：“往后工作有了门道啦！”绥化车站连结员窦宝山过去因为技术不好，做不好调车工作。他采用了李锡奎调车法之后，提高了调车效率，他说：“现在干起活来，又省劲又安全。”衡阳铁路管理局和郑州铁路管理局有些干部，还害怕“员工技术低”，不敢大胆实行李锡奎调车法，现在该是他们转变看法的时候了。
    有些铁路领导干部曾经耽心“实行李锡奎的连续溜放法不安全。”齐齐哈尔铁路分局监察室刘主任以为：“实行连续溜放法，会违背安全制度。”衡阳铁路管理局有些车站站长说：“连续溜放了，安全保不了。”郑州铁路管理局马头站站长吴振清害怕出事故，居然批评调车员不该实行连续溜放法。这些顾虑完全是没有根据的。李锡奎一年多来，实行连续溜放法，从来就没有发生过什么事故，事实上，李锡奎调车法的主要作用，就是为了保证安全，提高效率。有些干部看见李锡奎调车法是个否定了老一套的工作方法的新东西，以为不按老规矩办事，就不稳当。他们这种保守思想已经被铁的事实粉碎了。齐齐哈尔铁路分局刘监察主任曾去参观崔秀峰表演李锡奎调车法，他看见崔秀峰实行了连续溜放法，用十八分钟做了十八钩，把工作效率提高了一倍，又没有发生事故，他承认过去的看法不对，他说：“连续溜放，不会出事故。”
    强调“设备不好”“技术低”“不安全”而不积极推广李锡奎调车法的人们，在活生生的事实面前，都受到了教育。他们已经认识到他们的思想落后了，他们没有看见推广李锡奎调车法的条件已经成熟了。正因为批判了这种保守思想，这些车站推广李锡奎调车法的工作，才有了成绩。
    但是，许多事实还没有最后说服那些有保守思想的人，这些错误思想又改头换面地出现了，这就是缺乏集体主义的精神。有着这种思想的干部认为：
    “推广李锡奎调车法，是运输部门的事，和我无关。”因此，车务段和机务段不能很好地配合，检车段和车务段缺乏联系，运输部门之间也发生了不协调的现象。这种思想，严重地阻碍了李锡奎调车法的推广。东北佳木斯机务段从本部门利益出发，任意调换机车，在一个月内调换机车达二十一次，根本违反了固定机车的原则，妨碍了推广李锡奎调车法的工作。武昌车站调车员和扳道员互不服气，因而发生挤岔子，车辆脱线等事故。很多地区的机务段和车务段的交换班时间不一致，影响了调车员和司机的工作；而机务段的干部只考虑自己方便，却不愿改变时间。这样，有些调车员因为等司机交班，常常耽误工作达一小时之久。杭州车站和检车段联系不好，因之延长了技术作业的时间。所有这些现象，都说明推广李锡奎调车法，决不单纯是运输部门的事，而是整个有关部门共同的工作。铁路是一个庞大的联动机，任何部门都不是孤立的，都必须互相配合，互相联系。只顾自己而不顾别人的本位主义思想，是和铁路的集体性相对立的。应该坚决反对这种思想。否则，推广李锡奎调车法的工作也要失败。有些地区有意识地克服这种思想，成立了有关部门的联合劳动组织，因而胜利地推广了李锡奎调车法。东北梅河口车站和梅河口机务段、检车段，按期召开联合劳动会议，开展批评与自我批评，解决了互不协调的问题，避免了几次晚点事故。郑州车站和郑州机务段实行联合劳动，也解决了调车员和司机在工作上的矛盾。
    如上所述，推广李锡奎调车法的过程，就是开展思想斗争的过程。目前要深入地推广李锡奎调车法，还必须继续开展思想斗争，加强思想领导。没有实行李锡奎调车法的地区，应该赶快批判各种阻碍李锡奎调车法推行的错误思想。只有这样，才能做好李锡奎调车法的推广工作。
