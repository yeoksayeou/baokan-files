    China National Department Store East China Branch Supports Private Enterprises in Production, Widely Promotes Long-Term Ordering and Exclusive Sales Contracts
    China National Department Store East China Branch is widely promoting long-term contracts to support the development of private enterprises in a planned manner. In mid-May, the company successively convened worker symposiums and manufacturer symposiums for eighteen enterprises and forty-one factories in the fields of cultural and educational supplies, rubber, chemical industry, and small hardware to discuss the significance of expanding long-term ordering. In May, private factories in East China signed long-term contracts with the department store in twenty industries. Among them, industries that signed long-term ordering contracts include: knitwear, hardware, sundry goods, paper, and stationery, totaling one hundred and seventy-eight factories; more than one hundred and twenty factories signed long-term exclusive sales contracts. The products of seven industries, including clocks, fountain pens, and rubber, will be exclusively sold by the department store until the end of the year. Before April, only sixty-one factories had long-term contracts; in May, this number surged to ninety-eight. The transaction volume of long-term contracts for paper and stationery in May increased by 51.94% compared to April. Currently, many factories are still negotiating long-term exclusive sales and ordering contracts with the department store.
    In the process of promoting long-term contracts, the East China Branch of the Department Store, on the one hand, urged private manufacturers to eliminate the "five poisons," and on the other hand, actively made reasonable adjustments to the phenomenon of temporarily high or low prices of certain commodities to maintain production. For example, the selling price of Jin Xing brand No. 26 fountain pens was 564,300 yuan per dozen before the "Three-Anti" campaign, and was reduced to 480,000 yuan after the "Three-Anti" campaign; after careful calculation of costs, it was found that the price was still high, and recently it was agreed to adjust it to 444,000 yuan, which still guarantees a net profit of 10% for the capitalists. The price of fountain pens produced by the Hongguang Steel Pen Factory once fell to 52,000 yuan per dozen in March. The department store has raised the price to 57,000 yuan in this long-term contract. In order to strengthen the planning of private factory production and expand the promotion of long-term contracts, the East China Branch of the Department Store stipulates that the purchase price of long-term contracts should be higher than the usual acquisition price and short-term contracts. For example, when the department store acquired Samsung toothpaste in March, it was 300,000 yuan per case; this time, when signing a long-term contract, it was raised to 310,000 yuan per case.
    The implementation of long-term contracts has guaranteed private factories in terms of profits, production, and sales, which has boosted the confidence of capitalists in production, and the production enthusiasm of workers has become even higher. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the China Chemical Industry Society had difficulty in capital turnover and production stagnation because the old ordering contract expired and the department store did not purchase the finished products, resulting in a backlog of 25,000 cases of Samsung toothpaste. Since the end of March, the department store has successively purchased all the finished products of the factory, and production has gradually recovered. In May, the department store signed a long-term ordering contract with the factory for 10,000 cases per month, accounting for 83.33% of the factory's total production, and guaranteeing its appropriate profit. After the Great Wall Pencil Factory signed a long-term contract with the department store, it has now formulated a "raw material supply plan," and signed raw material supply contracts with relevant manufacturers, and also formulated a "work-in-progress circulation plan," so as to ensure that capital, raw materials, and production process can be continuously circulated according to the plan. Therefore, the capitalists of the factory are full of confidence and guarantee to overcome the idea of simply pursuing profits under the leadership of the state-owned economy. After hearing about the signing of the long-term exclusive sales contract with the department store, the workers of the factory immediately launched a heated discussion, established a technical research group, and made a guarantee to the trade union to improve product quality in order to complete the state ordering tasks.

    中国百货公司华东区公司扶植私营企业生产
    广泛推行长期定货和包销合同
    中国百货公司华东区公司广泛推行长期合同，有计划地扶植私营企业发展生产。在五月中旬，该公司曾先后召开文教用品、橡胶、化学工业、小五金等十八个企业、四十一家工厂的工人座谈会和厂商座谈会，讨论扩大长期定货的意义。五月份华东私营工厂和该区百货公司订立长期合同的计有二十个行业。其中，订立长期定货合同的有：针棉织、五金、五洋、纸张、文具等行业共一百七十八家工厂；订立长期包销合同的有一百二十多家工厂，其中钟表、金笔、橡胶等七个行业的产品，全部由百货公司包销到年底。四月份以前订有长期合同的只有六十一家，五月份已激增至九十八家。纸张文具长期合同成交额，五月份比四月份增加百分之五一·九四。目前，还有许多工厂正在和百货公司商订长期包销和定货合同。
    华东区百货公司在推行长期合同的过程中，一方面督促私营厂商，清除“五毒”，同时对于若干商品价格暂时偏高或偏低的现象，也积极加以合理调整，以维护生产。例如金星牌二六号金笔，“三反”以前每打卖价为五十六万四千三百元，“三反”以后减低为四十八万元；经过仔细核算成本以后，发现价格仍高，最近协议调整为四十四万四千元，仍能保证资方百分之十的净利。红光钢笔厂出产的钢笔，三月间每打的价格曾跌至五万二千元，百货公司在这次订长期合同时，已把价格提高为五万七千元。为加强私营工厂生产的计划性，扩大推行长期合同，华东区百货公司规定长期合同的购价比平时收购和短期合同要高些。如百货公司在三月份收购三星牙膏时，每罗为三十万元，这次订长期合同，就提高到每罗三十一万元。
    长期合同的推行，使私营工厂在利润、生产、销路等方面都有了保障，资方生产信心提高，工人生产情绪更为高涨。如中国化学工业社在今年第一季度，因旧的定货合同期满，百货公司没有收购，成品销不出去，积压三星牙膏达二万五千罗，因而资金周转困难，生产停顿。自三月底起，百货公司陆续收购了该厂的全部成品以后，生产逐渐恢复。到五月份，百货公司又和该厂订立每月一万罗的长期定货合同，占该厂全部生产量的百分之八十三·三三，并保证其有适当利润。长城铅笔厂和百货公司订立长期合同以后，现已制定“原材料供应计划”，与有关厂商订立原材料供应合同，还订立了“在制品流转计划”，这样就保证资金、原料、生产过程都能按计划连续地流转。因此该厂资本家满怀信心，并保证要在国营经济的领导下克服单纯追求利润的思想。该厂工人们听到与百货公司订立长期包销合同以后，立刻展开热烈讨论，成立技术研究小组，并向工会提出保证，以提高产品质量，来完成国家定货任务。
