    We Need to Promote Rural Libraries
    Comrade Editor: The liberated Chinese peasants, with the development of the rural economy, are increasingly eager to learn culture. Therefore, under possible conditions, it is very necessary to universally establish rural libraries through revolutionary means. It is an important place for educating peasants. From the library in Yuanqu Village, She County, Hebei, we can see that rural libraries not only widely conduct current affairs and political education to peasants, improve their cultural level, and promote the current central work; but also play a significant role in improving varieties and farming methods, providing a strong guarantee for increasing production. The work experience of the Yuanqu Village Library in She County, Hebei, is worth paying attention to. It is hoped that the cultural and educational departments in various places will refer to this experience to extensively establish rural libraries, and open up a broad road for the development of rural cultural undertakings in New China.

    我们要推广农村图书室
    编辑同志：解放了的中国农民，随着农村经济的发展，日益迫切地要求学习文化。因此，在可能的条件下，用革命的办法，普遍设立农村图书馆，是非常必要的。它是教育农民的一个重要场所。我们从河北涉县原曲村的图书室可以看到，农村图书室不但能广泛地向农民进行时事政治教育，提高他们的文化水平，推动当前的中心工作；并且在改良品种和耕作方法上，也起了很大的作用，对增产提供了有力的保证。河北涉县原曲村图书室的工作经验是值得重视的，希望各地的文教部门参考这一经验，广泛地建立农村图书室，为新中国农村文化事业的发展开辟广阔的道路。        朱天俊
