    Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team
    The Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Team of the Hengshan Coal Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau in Northeast China has created a new record for tunneling in Northeast China's coal mines. The many good experiences of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team are worthy of attention by coal mines across the country.
    In many coal mines in Northeast China, the tunneling efficiency cannot keep up with the needs of coal mining. Therefore, improving tunneling efficiency has become one of the keys to improving coal mine production in Northeast China. The Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team created a new record of 44.95 meters per day and 703 meters per month, doubling the labor efficiency of ordinary tunneling teams. This has played a huge role in the production increase campaign in Northeast China's coal mines.
    The Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team has implemented a preliminary division of labor and cooperation, strengthened the connection between various types of work, further improved the technology of drilling and blasting, and maximized the effectiveness of coal loading machines. These are the main reasons why they have improved tunneling efficiency. These experiences can be promoted in many coal mines with low tunneling efficiency.
    Of course, some parts of the labor organization and operation methods of the Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team are still worth studying. For example, having too many workers operating in one tunnel can easily lead to idle work; in multi-channel coal seams, the cyclic operation method has not yet been implemented, which means that the specialization of work types cannot be further realized. In order to solve these problems, it is hoped that relevant parties will launch an in-depth discussion so that this advanced experience can be further improved and enriched.

    学习崔国山掘进队的先进经验
    东北鸡西矿务局恒山煤矿崔国山快速掘进队创造了东北煤矿掘进的新纪录。崔国山掘进队的许多良好经验，是值得各地煤矿加以重视的。
    东北许多煤矿的掘进效率赶不上采煤的需要，因此，提高掘进效率已成为改进东北的煤矿生产的关键之一。崔国山掘进队创造了日进四十四点九五公尺，月进七百零三公尺的新纪录，比一般的掘进组的劳动效率提高了一倍。这在东北煤矿的增产运动中，发挥了巨大的作用。
    崔国山掘进队实行了初步的分工协作，密切了各种工种之间的联系，进一步改进了打眼放炮的技术，发挥了装煤机的效能，这是他们提高了掘进效率的主要原因。这些经验，在许多掘进效率不高的煤矿中，都可以推广。
    当然，崔国山掘进队的劳动组织和操作方法中的若干部分，还是值得研究的。例如，在一个洞子中由过多的工人进行操作，这就容易发生窝工现象；在多孔道的煤层中，尚未实行循环作业法，这就还不能进一步实现工种专业化。为了解决这些问题，希望有关方面，展开一个深入的讨论，使这种先进经验能进一步提高起来，丰富起来。
