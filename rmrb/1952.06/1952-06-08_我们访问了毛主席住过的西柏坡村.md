    We Visited Xibaipo Village, Where Chairman Mao Lived
    By Tian Bo, Returning Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers

    During our visit to North China with the delegation of the Korean People’s Representatives, the happiest thing for everyone was visiting Xibaipo Village in Jianping County, Hebei Province, where Chairman Mao once lived. In 1947, when the Chinese People's Liberation War was at its most critical juncture, the command center of the Chinese people was located here. The historically significant National Land Conference convened by the Chinese Communist Party and the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were both held here. The fate of the final annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's millions of troops was also decided here. This is a place revered by people all over the country.

    On March 4th, we arrived at this glorious village amidst the warm welcome of thousands of people from Xibaipo Village and nearby villages. We reported on the situation on the Korean front to the people of Xibaipo Village, and they also enthusiastically told us many things.

    The people of Xibaipo especially miss Chairman Mao. They clearly remember that it was the year Chairman Mao came to Xibaipo that we liberated the important city of Shijiazhuang, and from then on, the People's Liberation War rapidly moved towards complete victory. It was also at that time that the vigorous land reform movement began, and the vast number of peasants were thoroughly liberated. In conversations, everyone excitedly told us, "Since Chairman Mao came, the victories have been getting bigger and bigger." "Since Chairman Mao came, our lives have been getting better day by day." "Since Chairman Mao came, then..." In people's minds, Chairman Mao is victory, Chairman Mao is happiness. Everyone told us many stories of Chairman Mao's love for the people. Village cadre Yan Dezhong pointed to the inscription "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" given to them by Chairman Mao, hanging on the wall, and said, "Even after Chairman Mao went to Beijing, he still thought of us all the time. This was given to us last year when the visiting delegation of the old revolutionary base areas sent by the Central People's Government came. Last year, we had diseases and suffered from drought. Chairman Mao sent the Chinese Youth Medical Team to treat us, sent us relief grain, and also sent twelve sets of cotton-padded clothing." He told a story. He said: "When Chairman Mao was here, once, a child named Lan Ting in our village was bitten by a dog. After Chairman Mao found out, he personally ordered him to be sent to the hospital for treatment. Chairman Mao also told the doctor: This is the country's little master, treat him well. Under Chairman Mao's kind care, the child fully recovered in just a few days." Then he said: "The leaders treated people so kindly and amiably. One day after dinner, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De went for a walk in the fields and saw peasants resting on the edge of the field, so they squatted down and talked with them. After looking at the heavy hoes used by the villagers, they said: You are working hard, work hard! We will replace them with new farm tools in the future..." At the forum, everyone talked about the suffering days during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the War of Resistance against Japan, and the current happy and joyful life. Village chief Wang Shusheng instructed us: "When you return to Beijing, tell Chairman Mao that the people of Xibaipo Village thank him. Please tell him that the more than three hundred houses in our village that were burned down by the Japanese devils have been completely rebuilt, and more than four hundred more have been built. In the land reform, the big evil landlords like Qi Xueshao of Beizhuang Village and Liu Kuiyuan of Jiayu Village have been overthrown. The land and property in our village that were seized have been recovered, and the irrigated land has increased from 200 mu to 390 mu, and the dry land has also increased from 170 mu to 240 mu. The People's Government has also sent a lot of grain to help us, and lent a lot of grain and money to help us open ditches for production. Now our lives are getting better day by day. Please tell him to rest assured."

    We and the representatives of the Korean People's Delegation visited the places where Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and other comrades lived during the Liberation War with excitement and love. Chairman Mao lived in two flat-roofed houses that were the same as ordinary civilian houses. Inside, besides an old desk, a bookshelf, a few chairs, stools, and a small coffee table, there were no other furnishings. It was in this ordinary house that Chairman Mao wisely led the Chinese People's Liberation War to a rapid victory. Everyone who went with us was moved by the great leader's hard-working and simple life. Everyone felt that this gave them the strength to overcome difficult environments when they returned to the Korean front to fight against American imperialism. Wang Zhiting, secretary of the Jianping County Party Committee, told us: This year, the People's Government is also preparing to further renovate Xibaipo Village. All the houses where the central responsible comrades lived are prepared to be renovated as much as possible according to the original appearance in order to better preserve this historically significant historical site. The people living nearby have unanimously expressed their willingness to do everything possible to assist in this work. They said: "It is a great honor for our village to have Chairman Mao living here!"

    When we left, the people of Xibaipo and nearby villages reluctantly sent us out of the village. Yan Dezhong, the secretary of the village branch, tightly held our hands and said, "We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words: Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory. Guarantee to do our village work better." Village chief Wang Shusheng said: "Please tell the comrades on the front line after you return to Korea: The people of Xibaipo Village will definitely support you with all our strength, resist to the end, aid to the end, until the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea."

    我们访问了毛主席住过的西柏坡村
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　田波
    我们和朝鲜人民访华代表在访问华北各地时，大家最高兴的一件事，就是访问了毛主席从前住过的地方——河北省建屏县西柏坡村。在一九四七年，中国人民解放战争处在最紧要关头的时候，中国人民的司令台就设在这里。具有伟大历史意义的中国共产党召集的全国土地会议和中国共产党的七届二中全会都是在这里开的，蒋介石匪帮数百万大军最后覆灭的命运，也是在这里决定的。这是全国人民所敬仰的地方。
    三月四日，我们在西柏坡村和附近各村数千人热烈欢迎之下，到达了这个光荣的村庄。我们向西柏坡村人民报告了朝鲜前线的情况，他们也热情地向我们讲了许多事情。
    西柏坡的人民，特别怀念毛主席。他们清楚地记得，就是毛主席来到西柏坡的那年，我们解放了重要的城市石家庄，从此人民解放战争便迅速走向全面的胜利。也就是那个时候，轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动开始了，广大的农民彻底地翻了身。大家在谈话中，都是兴高彩烈地这样告诉我们：“自从毛主席来了，胜利就越来越大。”“自从毛主席来了，我们的生活便一天比一天好起来了。”“自从毛主席来了，就…………”在人们的心目中，毛主席就是胜利，毛主席就是幸福。大家给我们讲述了很多毛主席热爱人民的故事。村干部阎德中指着挂在墙上的毛主席赠给他们的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的题字说：“毛主席到了北京以后，还时刻想着我们，这就是去年中央人民政府派出的老革命根据地人民访问团来到时赠给我们的。去年我们这里发生了疾病，遭了旱灾，毛主席又派中国青年医疗队来给我们治病，给我们发来救济粮，还发了十二套棉衣。”他说了一个故事。他说：“毛主席在这里的时候，有一次，俺们村里有个叫兰亭的孩子，叫狗咬伤了。毛主席知道后，亲自叫送到医院去治，毛主席还嘱咐医生：这是国家的小主人，要好好的治。在毛主席的亲切关怀下，那个孩子不多几天就完全好了。”接着他又说：“首长们待人都是那样和蔼可亲。有一天晚饭后，毛主席和朱总司令到田间散步，见到农民在地头上休息，就蹲在一起谈起话来，他们看了看老乡使用的笨重的锄头后说：你们很辛苦，好好干吧！以后咱们换上新式农具就好了……”在座谈会上，大家从国民党反动派统治时期和抗日战争时期的苦难日子，谈到了目前幸福和愉快的生活。村长王树声嘱咐我们：“你们回到北京，对毛主席说吧，西柏坡村人民感谢他老人家。请告诉他，俺们村被日本鬼子烧毁的三百多间房子，已经完全重修起来了，另外还多盖了四百多间。在土地改革中，北庄村的齐学韶、贾峪村的刘奎元等大恶霸地主，都被打倒了。俺们村被强占去的土地财产都收回来了，水地由二百亩增加到三百九十亩，旱地也由一百七十亩增加到二百四十亩。人民政府又发了很多粮食救济我们，还贷给不少粮款，帮助开渠生产，现在我们的日子已经一天比一天好起来了，请告诉他老人家放心。”
    我们和朝鲜人民访华团的代表，满怀兴奋和敬爱的心情，一一地参观了在解放战争期间，毛主席、朱总司令及刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时等同志所住过的地方。毛主席所住的是两间和普通民房一样的平顶房，里面除了一张老旧的办公桌、一个书橱、几只椅子、凳子和一个小茶几外，再也没有其他的陈设。就是在这一间平凡的房子里，毛主席英明地领导中国人民解放战争迅速走向胜利。同去的每一个人，都被伟大领袖的艰苦朴素的生活所感动。大家觉得这给自己回到朝鲜前线与美帝国主义作战时，增添了战胜艰苦环境的力量。建屏县委书记王植庭同志对我们说：今年人民政府还准备进一步将西柏坡村整修一下，凡是中央负责同志所住过的房子，都准备尽量按照原样加以修整，以便更好地保存这个有历史意义的史迹。住在附近的人民，都一致表示愿尽一切努力协助这一工作。他们说：“俺村住过毛主席真光荣！”
    当我们离开的时候，西柏坡和附近各村的人民恋恋不舍地把我们送到村外，村支部书记阎德中紧紧地握着我们的手说：“我们一定牢牢地记住毛主席的话：发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣。保证把我村的工作做的更好。”村长王树声说：“请你们回到朝鲜后，告诉前方的同志们：西柏坡人民一定全力支援你们，抗到底，援到底，直到抗美援朝的最后胜利。”
