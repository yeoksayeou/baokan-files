Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd: The tragic fate of the tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were driven from Geoje Island to the mainland in April under the duress of American machine guns and bayonets remains unknown. In the U.S.-run concentration and death camps on the mainland, Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are suffering persecution and facing death and enslavement at the hands of their mortal enemies, the Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, but an iron curtain stands between them and the people of the world, preventing them from seeing the true situation in these U.S. concentration and death camps.

The U.S.'s attitude of keeping silent about the situation in its mainland prisoner-of-war camps seems even more sinister when compared to their blatant publicity about the Geoje Island slaughterhouse. British, Canadian, and Dutch troops have all been deployed to participate in the U.S.'s crimes of terrorizing and massacring prisoners of war. American news agencies have used a great deal of space to brag about Bonner's bloody crimes of suppressing prisoners of war, and the wild talk of creating more bloody incidents. This deliberate manipulation of world opinion is clearly intended to divert people's attention and prevent them from paying attention to the even more brutal crimes they are secretly carrying out to persecute Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on the mainland who are fighting for the right to return home.

The most compelling evidence to reveal the truth about the transfer of large numbers of prisoners of war to the mainland is the extreme secrecy of this transfer. The U.S. Department of Defense has gone to great lengths to conceal from the people of the world the actual situation of what the American representative at Panmunjom now calls the "humanitarian screening process."

The U.S. did not notify the Korean and Chinese representatives of this transfer. They didn't even allow a single American journalist to see the large-scale transfer of Geoje Island prisoners of war in April. They have not reported to the Korean and Chinese representatives how many Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are in these death camps on the mainland after the secret transfer. The people of the world have been kept in the dark. Now the U.S. suddenly presents to the world "a major and irreversible factor in the prisoner of war issue": believe it or not, 100,000 prisoners of war would rather "commit suicide" than return home to reunite with their families.

However, in the so-called "humanitarian screening" and secret transfer under the bayonet, prisoners of war shed a lot of blood, and a large number of prisoners of war were murdered. As early as February and March of this year, prisoners of war were massacred on Geoje Island when U.S. troops under the command of Dodd wanted prisoners of war to "freely state their allegiance." On April 10, U.S. troops, in order to create "major and irreversible factors," drove prisoners of war to the mainland, and more than 60 prisoners of war were massacred and shot.

After the bloodshed, three Korean prisoners of war who escaped from Camp 76 on Geoje Island explained the truth about the so-called "very fair screening process." On April 14, Dodd led three officers to gather the prisoners of war in Camp 76 and told them that those who were willing to serve the United Nations forces could be released as long as they signed a blood letter against the Communist Party. The prisoners of war shouted in unison, "Send us home! We don't want to join the United Nations forces!" Dodd and his officers fled Camp 76 in embarrassment under the cover of American rifles and machine guns.

On the mainland, prisoners of war who "would rather commit suicide than go home" were shot for wanting to go home. In the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, on May 20, prisoners of war were also massacred and shot for resisting segregation and transfer. Reuters reported: "Officials said that the prisoners of war had resisted screening on the issue of repatriation." Before the massacre, the U.S. also cut off the prisoners of war's food in an attempt to force them to submit.

Nine days later, on May 29, in the Yongcheon prisoner-of-war camp north of Busan, three prisoners of war were massacred and thirteen prisoners of war were shot. Van Fleet's Eighth Army Headquarters issued only a short message, not daring to mention the "Communist elements" and "anti-Communist elements" they had previously promoted, but called these prisoners of war "detained civilians." Their reporters did not provide continuous coverage of this event.

The calls for repatriation from the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have all been stifled in this U.S. silence.

    美方正秘密迫害被移到大陆上的我被俘人员
    【新华社开城二日电】四月间在美国机枪和刺刀的威逼下被从巨济岛赶到大陆上去的数万名朝中战俘的悲惨遭遇，仍然无从知悉。在大陆上美方的集中营与死亡营中，朝中战俘在他们的死敌李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的手中遭受迫害，面临死亡和奴役，但一道铁幕却横在世界人民的面前，使世界人民看不到美方这些集中营和死亡营中的真实情况。
    美方这种对其大陆上的战俘营的情形讳莫如深的态度，在与他们对巨济岛屠场的大肆宣传相形之下，显得更加恶毒了。英国、加拿大和荷兰军队都被调去参加美国对战俘实行恐怖和屠杀的罪行。美国各新闻通讯社用了很大篇幅吹嘘波纳的镇压战俘的血腥罪行，和要制造更多血腥事件的狂言。这种故意玩弄世界舆论的手段显然是为了转移人们的视线，使人们不再注意他们正在秘密进行的迫害大陆上为争取回国权利而斗争的朝中战俘的更其残暴的罪行。
    最足以揭露把大批战俘移到大陆上的真相的证据，就是这次迁移极为秘密。美国国防部曾经费尽心机在世界人民面前掩盖板门店美国代表现在所称的“人道甄别过程的结果”的实际情况。
    美方未曾把这次迁移通知朝中代表。他们甚至没有让任何一个美国记者去看一看四月间大规模迁移巨济岛战俘的事件。他们未曾向朝中代表报告在秘密迁移之后，共有多少朝中战俘在大陆上这些死亡营中。世界人民一直被蒙在鼓里。现在美方忽然在世界面前提出了“战俘问题中的重大的不可改变的因素”：信不信由你，十万战俘宁愿“自杀”，也不愿回国与家人团圆。
    但是，在所谓“人道甄别”和刺刀尖下的秘密迁移中，战俘流了不少鲜血，大批战俘遭到谋害。早在今年二月和三月，杜德指挥的美国军队要战俘“自由地说明他们忠于何方”的时候，战俘们就在巨济岛遭到屠杀。四月十日，美国军队为了制造“重大的不可改变的因素”，把战俘赶到大陆上，又有六十多名战俘遭到屠杀和枪伤。
    在血案之后，由巨济岛七十六号营场逃出来的三名朝鲜战俘，说明了所谓“十分公平的甄别过程”的真相。四月十四日，杜德率领三名军官把七十六号营场的战俘召集起来，对他们说，愿意为联合国军服务的人，只要签写反对共产党的血书，就可以得到释放。战俘齐声高喊“送我们回家！我们不要参加联合国军！”杜德和他的军官就在美国步枪和机关枪的掩护下，狼狈逃出七十六号营场。
    在大陆上，“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的战俘因为要回家而遭到枪杀。在釜山战俘营中，五月二十日，战俘们因为反抗隔离与迁移也遭到屠杀和枪伤。路透社报道：“官员说，战俘们曾经反抗遣返问题的甄别。”在屠杀之前，美方还断绝战俘的粮食，想逼迫他们屈服。
    九天后，五月二十九日，在釜山北面永川战俘营中，三名战俘被屠杀，十三名战俘被枪伤。范佛里特第八军总部的声明只发表了很短的消息，不敢再提他们以前所宣传的什么“共产党分子”和“反共分子”，却把这些战俘叫做“被拘平民”。他们的记者们对这一事件也没有连续报道。
    朝中战俘要求遣返的呼声，都被窒息在美方这种讳莫如深的沉默里面了。
