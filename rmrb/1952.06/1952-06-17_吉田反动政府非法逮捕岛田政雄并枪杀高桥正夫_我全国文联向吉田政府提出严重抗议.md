Xinhua News Agency: In the recent mass arrests in Japan, the Yoshida reactionary government, under the pretext that the famous Japanese scholar of Chinese literature, Masao Shimada, was suspected of participating in the May Day Labor Day in Tokyo's People's Square, illegally arrested him on May 3rd. Prior to this, the American and Japanese reactionaries shot and killed Masao Takahashi, a member of the Japanese "China Literature and Art Research Association," in Tokyo's People's Square on May 1st. The Japanese "China Literature and Art Research Association" feels infinite anger at this inhumane and shameful crime committed by domestic and foreign imperialists, and on May 5th, it sent a letter of "indictment to Chinese literary and art workers" to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, accusing the atrocities of the Yoshida government of Japan. After hearing the news, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles was extremely indignant, and lodged a strong protest against the atrocities of the Yoshida government, and on the 26th, replied to the Japanese "China Literature and Art Research Association," expressing strong support for their firm and unyielding just struggle.

The Japanese "China Literature and Art Research Association" said in its "indictment to Chinese literary and art workers": We feel infinite anger at the domestic and foreign imperialists for shooting our association member Masao Takahashi and illegally arresting Masao Shimada, and this has further strengthened our determination to fight them to the end. Masao Shimada is the most outstanding Chinese literature researcher in Japan. He had long ago translated and introduced famous Chinese works such as Zhou Erfu's "Doctor Bethune" and Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Family Village" to Japan, and made brilliant contributions to the research of Chinese literature and art in Japan. We feel very painful about Shimada's arrest and Takahashi's shooting. However, we will never yield to these suppressions. We will unite with people who truly love peace, and vigorously launch a rescue movement to demand the release of Masao Shimada and others.

The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles said in its reply: We were extremely angry when we learned of the illegal arrest of Masao Shimada and the innocent shooting of Masao Takahashi. We, on behalf of all literary and art workers in the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles who are fighting for peace, lodge a strong protest against this atrocity of the Yoshida government. At the same time, we express our deep sympathy and resolute support for your firm and unyielding will and actions in the just struggle. We believe that this atrocity of the Yoshida government is a provocation by the American and Japanese reactionaries in collusion with each other against the just people of the world who are fighting for peace. This atrocity of theirs will never save them from their serious crises in all aspects, nor will it be able to strike at the will of the Japanese people to resolutely fight for independence, freedom, and peace. On the contrary, this atrocity further exposes the viciousness of the American and Japanese reactionaries and their fear of the world's peace forces. They will inevitably suffer a miserable defeat and eat their own bitter fruit. The Japanese people, who are fighting for independence, democracy, and peace, will further enhance their fighting spirit and deal a fatal blow to the American and Japanese reactionaries. We hope that you and the people of the whole country will unite closely and continue to fight resolutely. We will also better contribute all our strength to the cause of peace and fight together with you. We firmly believe that with the strong support of all justice-loving people in the world, headed by the Soviet Union, and under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people who are fighting heroically for independence, democracy, and peace.

    吉田反动政府非法逮捕岛田政雄并枪杀高桥正夫
    我全国文联向吉田政府提出严重抗议
    【新华社讯】在日本最近的大逮捕中，吉田反动政府藉口日本著名的中国文学研究家岛田政雄有在东京人民广场参加“五一”劳动节的嫌疑，在五月三日非法逮捕了他；在此以前，美、日反动派并于五月一日在东京人民广场枪杀了日本“中国文学艺术研究会”会员高桥正夫。日本“中国文学艺术研究会”对国内外帝国主义者这种惨无人道的可耻罪行，感到无限的愤怒，特于五月五日致中华全国文学艺术界联合会“向中国文艺工作者控诉”一书，控诉日本吉田政府的暴行。中华全国文学艺术界联合会闻讯后，万分愤怒，特对吉田政府的暴行提出严重的抗议，并于二十六日函复日本“中国文学艺术研究会”，表示大力支持他们坚定不屈的正义斗争。
    日本“中国文学艺术研究会”的“向中国文艺工作者控诉”书说：我们对于国内外帝国主义者枪杀本会会员高桥正夫并非法逮捕岛田政雄，感到无限的愤怒，因而更加巩固了我们对它们斗争到底的决心。岛田政雄是日本最优秀的中国文学研究家，他老早把周而复著“白求恩大夫”、赵树理著“李家庄的变迁”等中国名著翻译介绍到日本来，在日本对中国文学艺术的研究上立了辉煌的功绩。我们对于岛田被逮捕和高桥被枪杀感到非常痛苦。但是我们对于这些镇压决不屈服，我们要与真正爱好和平的人民团结一致，为了要求释放岛田政雄等人，大力展开拯救运动。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会的复信说：当我们得知岛田政雄被非法逮捕和高桥正夫被无辜枪杀的消息时，感到万分愤怒。我们谨代表中华全国文学艺术界为和平而斗争的全体文艺工作者，对吉田政府此种暴行提出严重抗议。同时对你们的坚定不屈的正义斗争意志和行动表示深切同情和坚决支持。我们认为吉田政府此种暴行，是美、日反动派互相勾结向全世界为和平而斗争的正义人民的一种挑衅，他们这种暴行绝不能挽救他们各方面的严重危机，也绝不能打击日本人民为争取独立、自由、和平而坚决斗争的意志，相反地，这种暴行更暴露了美、日反动派的穷凶极恶，和对于世界和平力量的恐惧，他们必将遭到惨败而自食其恶果。为争取独立、民主、和平而斗争的日本人民将会更加提高其斗志，给美、日反动派以致命的打击。希望你们和全国人民紧密地团结起来，继续坚决地战斗，我们也将更好地为和平事业贡献全部力量，和你们共同奋斗。我们坚信：在以苏联为首的全世界一切主张正义的人民的大力支持下，和在日本共产党的领导下，最后胜利一定属于为独立、民主、和平而英勇斗争的日本人民。
