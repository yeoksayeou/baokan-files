    Dong Zhishen writes that
    Economic workers should maintain their position and be honest and incorruptible
    Editor: In the "Reader's Letter" column of the June 15th People's Daily, Comrade Dong Anping wrote a letter saying, "It is difficult for those doing economic work to avoid being dragged down by unscrupulous merchants." I think this understanding is wrong. Why do corruption, bribery, and other illegal behaviors occur in the revolutionary ranks? This is because some comrades are influenced by the bourgeoisie's corrupt and hedonistic ideas. In order to satisfy their desire for pleasure, they do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the people, so that they are dragged down by lawless bourgeois elements. Therefore, the key to the problem lies in maintaining one's position and not being influenced by bourgeois ideology, not in whether or not one does economic work.
    Some economic workers in our department's military supplies section handle a lot of money, but there have been no cases of embezzlement or illegal activity. Conversely, some people who do not do economic work, such as our correspondent Zhang Baocang, have engaged in embezzlement and bribery. The attacks of lawless bourgeois elements are very rampant. We should increase our vigilance a hundredfold, stand firm on the proletarian position, and strengthen ideological transformation. Only in this way can we fundamentally eliminate all errors. Dong Zhishen

### 董之慎来信说  经济工作人员应该站稳立场廉洁奉公

    董之慎来信说
    经济工作人员应该站稳立场廉洁奉公
    编辑同志：六月十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了董安平同志的来信，他说“做经济工作难免被奸商拉下水去”。我认为这种认识是错误的。为什么革命队伍里发生了贪污、受贿等非法行为呢？这是因为有些同志受了资产阶级腐化享乐思想的影响。他们为了满足享乐的欲望，不惜出卖人民的利益，以致被不法资产阶级分子拉下水去。因此，问题的关键在于站稳立场，不受资产阶级思想的影响，而不在于做不做经济工作。
    我部军需处有些经济工作人员，他们经手的钱财很多，但是并没有发生贪污违法行为。相反的，有些不是作经济工作的人员，比如我们的通讯员张宝苍，却发生了贪污受贿行为。不法资产阶级分子的进攻是非常猖狂的。我们应该百倍地提高警惕，站稳无产阶级立场，加强思想改造，只有这样，才是根除一切错误的基本方法。董之慎
