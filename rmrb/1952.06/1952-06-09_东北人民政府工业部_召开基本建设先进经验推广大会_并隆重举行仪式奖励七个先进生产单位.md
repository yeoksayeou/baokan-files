    [This newspaper dispatch] Northeast News: The Northeast People's Government Industry Department convened a grand Advanced Basic Construction Experience Promotion Conference from May 27th to 29th. The conference, through performances and exhibitions, reviewed more than twenty advanced experiences of decisive significance and nearly a hundred kinds of new tools. The promotion of these advanced experiences and new tools is of great significance for carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement in basic construction, ensuring the on-time and ahead-of-schedule completion of construction plans, improving engineering quality, and reducing costs. More than 3,000 people attended the conference, including workers, technicians, and management cadres from the Northeast Industry Department's basic construction departments, and representatives from basic construction departments in various provinces and cities in the Northeast. The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and relevant units in Beijing, Central South, East China, Southwest and other regions also sent a group of construction workers, technicians, and trade union cadres to participate in this conference.

    Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Lin Feng, Vice Chairman, and others personally attended the conference to inspect the exhibited models and pictures and to visit the technical performances of advanced producers.

    This conference fully demonstrated the rich creative talents of the construction workers in the Northeast and the superiority of advanced experience. After the emergence of the Su Changyou team's segmented continuous bricklaying method in the Harbin Engineering Company last year, many construction workers were inspired and promoted, and they successively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improved labor organization, and created flow-line operation methods for carpentry, plastering, and caulking, which greatly improved labor efficiency. Subsequently, the reform of labor organization further developed into the reform of labor tools. At the same time, in terms of mechanical and electrical installation, mine shaft construction, geological drilling, and construction management, many advanced experiences in improving operating techniques and improving working methods have emerged. For example, the concrete vacuum operation method demonstrated by the Northeast Twenty-first Engineering Company at the conference allows the model board with concrete to be disassembled after 40 minutes. If the old method is used, it will take at least three days. The company used this method on the "366" construction site, which shortened the entire construction period by three-quarters compared to the plan, saving 15 to 20 percent of cement, saving 87 percent of the wood used for making model boards, and greatly strengthened the concrete's compactness, cold resistance, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance, improving the quality of the project. This year, on the basis of the segmented continuous bricklaying method, the Su Changyou team has learned from the Soviet Shavlyugin's "slurry squeezing method" and Tianjin Fu Hongbin's experience in creating a mortar spreading device, and further created the new bricklaying method of 1952 - the double-handed slurry squeezing bricklaying method. When using this method to build a two-brick-thick mixed mortar wall (one horizontal and one vertical joint), each worker can lay an average of 6,000 bricks per day, which is more than twice as high as the highest efficiency of their previous segmented bricklaying method. The "pre-installation" method adopted by the Northeast Twelfth Engineering Company (that is, assembling the machine while building the base and building the factory building) shortens the installation time by 30 to 50 percent. With this installation method, the machine can be started at the same time as the factory building is completed. The workers of the Northeast Twenty-second Engineering Company created the lead system for high-voltage cable heads, which changed the cable heads that used to be manufactured through complex processes such as making wooden models, sand turning, and iron melting, into a method of simply dipping the finished steel model into lead water at 370 degrees Celsius, taking it out, and peeling off the lead skin attached to the outside of the model. This method increases work efficiency by 70 times compared to before, and saves a lot of cast iron, tin, magnetic tubes, screws, and copper plates and other materials.

    After visiting the performances, exhibitions, and seminars, the workers, technicians, and management cadres who participated in the conference generally realized the importance of promoting advanced experience for doing a good job in basic construction. Many workers who originally held skeptical attitudes towards the advanced experience of the Su Changyou team and others also dispelled their doubts after visiting the site. Gu Wanzhen, a worker at the Liaoyang Construction Engineering Company, thought "there is nothing to see" when the company sent him to visit, and was reluctant to come, but after visiting the performance of the Su Changyou team, he said: "This method is really good!" He wrote down the operating methods of the Su Changyou team and drew the new tools one by one in his notebook, preparing to go back and learn. Some carpenters in the Changchun Engineering Department of the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration Engineering Company used to think, "The Xie Wanfu team is nothing great, why should we learn from them?" "That kind of division of labor is not good, you can't learn the full set of skills!" After the visit, they also said: "This experience must be learned!" At the same time, they also realized that only with specialized work can the technology be proficient and the work efficiency can be improved. On the other hand, the conference also encouraged the enthusiasm of advanced producers, and they all said that they would work hard to learn from the advanced experience of others. Xie Wanfu said: "There are many tools exhibited at this conference that we have not used. We must not be arrogant and complacent, we must continue to study our work, humbly learn from others, and improve ourselves!" All the technicians and management cadres who attended the meeting also expressed that they would vigorously organize and promote these advanced experiences after returning, and assist the workers in creating more advanced experiences.

    At the end of the conference, a grand award ceremony was held. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally presented the awards to the Northeast Twenty-first Engineering Company (concrete vacuum operation method), the Xi'an Coal Mine Mining Bureau Shaft Engineering Team (parallel operation method), the Su Changyou Team (segmented continuous bricklaying method and double-handed slurry squeezing bricklaying method), the Xie Wanfu Team (carpentry flow-line operation method), the Yang Dezhong Team (plastering flow-line operation method), the Yu Donghai Team (caulking flow-line operation method) and the Ma Wenzhi Team (rapid drilling method). Vice Chairman Lin Feng also spoke at the award ceremony. He first pointed out the importance of the Northeast People's Government's reward for advanced producers and advanced units and groups in basic construction. He said: We have already started step-by-step, focused, and large-scale economic construction, the primary part of which is industrial construction; and the most important link in the current industrial construction is to do a good job in basic construction. Therefore, the advanced production experience that has now emerged is of great significance for accelerating national industrial construction, saving national wealth, and improving the quality of basic construction. Vice Chairman Lin Feng also said: The reason why so many advanced experiences have emerged is because under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the consciousness of the working class has been raised, their high enthusiasm and creativity have been brought into play, and they have humbly learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. He called on all advanced production groups and individuals to be not arrogant or complacent, to have good contact with the masses, to consolidate and improve advanced production experience, to promote advanced production experience, and to complete and exceed the state's tasks of increasing production and practicing economy. It is required that after this conference, a mass upsurge of creating, learning, and promoting advanced experience should be launched in the Northeast. Finally, he called on the administrative and Party organizations and trade unions of all factories and mines to pay close attention to the creation and improvement of advanced production experience, to cultivate advanced producers, and to constantly help them improve, so as to train cadres for industrial construction. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the conference. He pointed out that the promotion of advanced experience is one of the important methods to ensure the completion of this year's large-scale basic construction tasks. He called on the vast number of construction workers to break with conservative ideas, actively create and learn advanced experience; construction trade union workers should discover, summarize and promote advanced experience well, so as to ensure the realization of Chairman Gao Gang's call for "faster, better and more economical".

    东北人民政府工业部
    召开基本建设先进经验推广大会
    并隆重举行仪式奖励七个先进生产单位
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部在五月二十七日到二十九日召开了盛大的基本建设先进经验推广大会。大会通过表演和展览等形式，检阅了二十多种有决定意义的先进经验和近百种新式工具。这些先进经验和新式工具的推广，对于在基本建设中开展增产节约运动，保证按期和提前完成施工计划，提高工程质量，降低成本，都有重大的意义。参加这次大会的有东北工业部各基本建设部门的工人、技术人员、管理干部和东北各省、市基本建设部门的代表共三千多人。中央人民政府燃料工业部，中华全国总工会和北京、中南、华东、西南等地区的有关单位也派有一批建筑工人、技术人员和工会干部，参加这个大会。
    东北人民政府高岗主席、林枫副主席等亲自到会检阅了展出的模型及图片和参观了先进生产者的技术表演。
    这次大会充分地显示了东北建筑工人丰富的创造才能和先进经验的优越性。去年哈尔滨工程公司苏长有小组的分段连续砌砖法出现后，很多建筑工人得到启示和推动，纷纷学习苏联先进经验，改进劳动组织，创造了木工、抹灰、抅缝等流水作业法，大大提高了劳动效率。接着又由劳动组织的改革，进一步发展到劳动工具的改革。同时，并在机电安装、矿山建井、地质钻探和施工管理等方面，出现了许多改进操作技术和改进工作方法的先进经验。如东北第二十一工程公司在大会上表演的混凝土真空作业法，使打上混凝土的模型板，在四十分钟以后就能拆开，若采用旧的方法，则至少需要三天。该公司在“三六六”号工地用这种方法施工，使整个工期较计划缩短了四分之三，节省水泥百分之十五至二十，节省作模型板用的木材百分之八十七，并大大加强了混凝土的密固、耐寒、抗磨、耐腐性，提高了工程质量。苏长有小组今年在分段连续砌砖法的基础上，又学习苏联沙夫留金“挤浆法”和天津傅鸿宾创造铺灰器的经验，进一步创造了一九五二年新的砌砖法——双手挤浆砌砖法。使用这种方法砌两砖厚的混水墙（一横一竖押缝）时，平均每天每个工人能砌六千块砖，比他们过去实行分段砌砖法的最高效率还高两倍以上。东北第十二工程公司采取的“预备安装”法（即在打基地、盖厂房的同时，就把机器装配起来），使安装时间缩短了百分之三十到五十以上。采用这种安装法，在厂房落成的同时机器就能开动起来。东北第二十二工程公司的工人，创造了高压线缆头铅制法，把过去需要经过作木型、翻砂、化铁等复杂过程才能制造出来的线缆头，改为只要把做好的钢型放在摄氏三百七十度的铅水中一蘸，提出后将附着在型外的铅皮套脱下即成。这种方法使工作效率比以前提高了七十倍，并节省了大量的铸铁、锡、磁管、螺丝和铜板等材料。
    参加这次大会的工人、技术人员和管理干部，经过参观表演、展览和座谈后，普遍地认识到推广先进经验对搞好基本建设的重要意义。许多原来对苏长有小组等先进经验抱着怀疑态度的工人，实地参观以后也都打消了怀疑。辽阳建设工程公司工人顾万镇，当公司派他来参观时，他认为“没有看头”，不大愿意来，但参观了苏长有小组的表演以后却说：“这办法真是好！”他把苏长有小组的操作方法记下来，把新式工具一个个画在本子上，准备回去学习。东北机械工业管理局工程公司长春工程处有些木工，过去认为“谢万福小组没啥了不起的，为什么向他们学习？”“那种分工方法不好，学不到全套技术！”参观后也说：“这经验不能不学！”同时也认识到：只有工作专业化，技术才能熟练，工作效率才能提高。另一方面，大会也鼓舞了先进生产者的热情，他们都表示要努力学习别人的先进经验。谢万福说：“这次大会展览的工具就有很多我们没用过的。我们一定不能骄傲自满，要继续钻研工作，虚心向别人学习，把自己提高一步！”所有到会的技术人员和管理干部，也表示回去以后要大力组织推广这些先进经验，并协助工人创造更多的先进经验。
    大会最后举行了隆重的授奖仪式，由东北人民政府副主席林枫亲自授奖，奖励了东北第二十一工程公司（混凝土真空作业法）、西安煤矿矿务局竖井工程队（平行作业法）、苏长有小组（分段连续砌砖法及双手挤浆砌砖法）、谢万福小组（木工流水作业法）、杨德重小组（抹灰流水作业法）、于东海小组（抅缝流水作业法）和马文志小组（快速钻进法）七个先进单位。林枫副主席并在授奖大会上讲了话。他首先指出了东北人民政府奖励基本建设中的先进生产者和先进单位和小组的重要意义。他说：我们已经开始了有步骤的、有重点的、大规模的经济建设，其中的首要部分是工业建设；而当前工业建设最重要的环节是搞好基本建设。因此，现在所出现的先进生产经验，对于加速国家工业建设、节约国家财富，提高基本建设质量，具有极大的意义。林枫副主席又说：所以能出现这么多的先进经验，是因为在毛主席和共产党的领导下，工人阶级的觉悟提高了，发挥了高度积极性和创造性，并虚心地学习了苏联的先进经验。他号召一切先进生产小组和个人，不骄傲、不自满，很好地联系群众，巩固和提高先进生产经验，推广先进生产经验，完成和超过国家的增产节约任务。要求在这次大会以后在东北掀起一个群众性的创造、学习和推广先进经验的高潮。最后他号召各厂矿行政和党的组织以及工会，要密切注意先进生产经验的创造和提高，培养先进生产者，并不断地帮助他们提高，为工业建设培养干部。东北总工会张维桢主席也在大会上讲了话。他指出：推广先进经验是保证完成今年大规模基本建设任务的重要方法之一。他号召广大建筑职工要打破保守思想，积极创造与学习先进经验；建筑工会工作者要很好地发现、总结和推广先进经验，以保证实现高岗主席“又快又好又省”的号召。
