    Supporting the Decision to Adjust the Departments and Faculties of Fu Jen Catholic University and Beijing Normal University

    Editor,

    On May 19th, Vice Minister Wei Que of the Central Ministry of Education delivered a report at our university on the measures for adjusting the departments and faculties of Fu Jen Catholic University and Beijing Normal University. After listening to this report, all the teachers of the Department of Education felt very excited and happy. Our great motherland needs tens of thousands of talented people with both virtue and ability for construction, and the training of teachers is an important link in the cause of cultivating national construction cadres. The country needs more than a million primary school teachers, as well as a large number of secondary school teachers. After the merger of Fu Jen Catholic University and Beijing Normal University, under the direct leadership of the Central Ministry of Education, it will surely become a new type of normal university, undertaking the great and glorious task of cultivating teachers. We believe that this decision of the Central Ministry of Education is completely correct. We warmly support this decision, guarantee unconditional obedience to organizational assignments, and actively do a good job in the work of adjusting departments and faculties.

    Teachers of the Department of Education, Fu Jen Catholic University: Zuo Xueli, Liu Yonghui, Yang Chengzhang,
                        Liu Shuxun, Mao Lirui, Xu Xiugui,
                        Ouyang Xiang, Cheng Shunying, Zhu Minglu,

    拥护辅仁大学和北京师范大学两校院系调整的决定
    编辑同志：五月十九日中央教育部韦悫副部长在我校做了关于辅仁大学、北京师范大学两校院系调整办法的报告。教育系的全体教员听了这个报告以后，感觉到非常兴奋和愉快。我们伟大的祖国需要成千成万德才兼备的建设人材，而在培养国家建设干部的事业中，师资的培养是重要的一环。全国需要百万以上的小学教师，以及大批的中学教师。辅仁大学和北京师范大学合并以后，在中央教育部的直接领导下，一定能成为一个新型的师范大学，担负起培养师资的伟大而光荣的任务。我们认为中央教育部的这一决定是完全正确的。我们热烈拥护这一决定，保证无条件地服从组织分配，并积极做好院系调整工作。
