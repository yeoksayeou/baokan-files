Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, June 1st. At the plenary session of the delegation of both sides in the Korean armistice talks on June 1st, General Nam Il, our chief representative, pointed out that the only issue hindering the realization of the Korean armistice is the POW issue. On this issue, our side has made many significant concessions and put forward the compromise solution of May 2nd, guaranteeing that both sides' POWs return home to live peaceful lives, which is absolutely fair and reasonable. However, the other side not only insisted on its illegal and absurd claim to detain POWs without making any concessions but also refused to conduct any negotiations within the meeting and continued to massacre POWs outside the meeting, deliberately obstructing the resolution of the POW issue. This behavior of the other side clearly shows that they fundamentally do not want a Korean armistice, are deliberately delaying negotiations, and are plotting to expand the war. General Nam Il emphasized: Our side has already gone more than halfway on the POW issue. If the other side intends to achieve an armistice, there is no reason to refuse to base the resolution of the POW issue on our reasonable compromise proposal. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

"The only reason currently hindering the Korean armistice is your side's attempt to detain our captured personnel. On the POW issue, our side has made continuous and significant efforts. However, your side has not only been determined to detain our captured personnel from the outset, when you proposed the absurd principle of one-for-one exchange, without making any concessions, but also gone back on your word, publicly overturned your own explicit statements, and even resorted to fabricating slanders to defend your attempt to detain our captured personnel. It is a matter of course and an unshakable principle to release and repatriate all POWs after the armistice. However, in order to dispel your side's so-called pretext of preventing one side from increasing its military strength, our side suggested on February 3rd that both sides guarantee that POWs would return to peaceful lives after repatriation and no longer participate in the war. Our side has never recognized the classification of our captured personnel originally residing in South Korea as detained civilians. However, in order to negotiate a solution based on mutual concessions within a reasonable scope, our side suggested on March 21st that the principle of both sides releasing and repatriating the POWs they hold be determined based on the POW lists exchanged on December 18, 1951. Since your side has repeatedly and clearly stated that it is willing to resolve the issue within the outline of our March 21st principle suggestion, and in view of the fact that some of the POWs held by both sides originally resided in the region of the holding party, our side proposed on March 27th a compromise adjustment principle that would allow both sides' POWs to return home immediately after the armistice. Our March 27th compromise proposal stipulates that both sides shall mutually and completely repatriate South Korean army personnel originally residing in South Korea or Korean People's Army personnel originally residing in North Korea, as well as all United Nations army or Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs. As for Korean POWs originally residing in the region of the holding party, if they are willing to go directly home after the armistice, both sides may not repatriate them. According to this clear and unambiguous adjustment principle, our side suggested revising the lists to determine the general number of repatriations by both sides. The entire process is recorded in the meeting minutes and cannot be distorted. Our side has made such significant efforts to resolve the POW issue, but your side has not only failed to make corresponding efforts but also publicly overturned your clear statement that you are willing to resolve the issue within the outline of our March 21st principle suggestion, thereby depriving further consultation of its basis. Recently, your side has further distorted the meeting minutes and falsely claimed that our side had agreed to your so-called screening aimed at detaining POWs, which is a complete and utter lie that is completely inconsistent with the dignity of this meeting. Rarely in history has there been such an act of bad faith as your side's. Your actions can only be seen as your side fundamentally not wanting to resolve the POW issue. Our May 2nd proposal is a completely reasonable compromise proposal. It guarantees that both sides' POWs return home to live peaceful lives and no longer participate in the war. It is formed by our side's multiple significant concessions. The rationality of our proposal is beyond doubt. Tens of thousands of POWs are eager to return home immediately, including your captured personnel. According to our proposal, the POWs can be on their way home within a few weeks. However, since May 2nd, your side has insisted on the one-sided and unreasonable claim of detaining POWs within the meeting, refused to conduct any negotiations, and, outside the meeting, has continued to kill POWs despite our repeated protests and the world's angry condemnation, deliberately creating a tense atmosphere and making it impossible to resolve the POW issue. Your side's blatant provocative behavior inside and outside the meeting is clearly aimed at obstructing the resolution of the POW issue, delaying the armistice negotiations, and plotting to expand the war. In order to negotiate a solution to the POW issue on a reasonable basis and realize the Korean armistice, our side has made multiple significant concessions and put forward the completely reasonable compromise proposal for resolving the POW issue on May 2nd. Our side has gone more than halfway on this issue, while your side has not made any concessions. If your side intends to achieve a Korean armistice rather than deliberately delaying the armistice negotiations, you have no reason to refuse to quickly resolve the POW issue based on our compromise proposal and realize the Korean armistice."

    美方阻挠解决战俘问题蓄意拖延谈判
    南日将军痛斥美方无耻阴谋
    重申我方合理方案为解决战俘问题的基础
    【新华社开城一日电】六月一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出，阻碍朝鲜停战的实现的只有一个战俘问题。在这个问题上，我方作了多次重大让步，提出五月二日的折衷解决方案，保证双方战俘回家过和平生活，绝对公平合理。但对方不仅坚持其扣留战俘的非法荒谬主张，未作任何让步，而且在会内拒绝进行任何谈判，在会外不断屠杀战俘，有意阻挠战俘问题的解决。对方此种行为，显因对方根本不愿朝鲜停战，蓄意拖延谈判，阴谋扩大战争。南日将军强调指出：我方在战俘问题上已走了一半以上的道路，如果对方有意实现停战，没有任何理由拒绝以我方合理折衷方案为解决战俘问题的基础。南日将军的主要发言如下：
    “目前阻碍朝鲜停战的唯一原因是你方企图扣留我方被俘人员。我方在战俘问题上，连续多次作了重大努力，但你方不仅从最初提出一比一的荒谬原则时起，就立意扣留我方被俘人员，未作任何让步，而且出尔反尔，公然推翻你方自己曾经作过的明确表示，使问题的解决倒退了一步，甚至采取捏造诬蔑的手段为扣留我方被俘人员的企图作辩护。停战后释放并遣返全体战俘是天经地义无可动摇的原则，但为了解除你方所谓防止一方增加军力的藉口，我方在二月三日建议双方保证战俘遣返后重过和平生活，不再参加战争。我方从未承认将原居住于南朝鲜的我方被俘人员分类为被拘留平民，但为了在合理范围内互相让步的基础上协商解决问题，我方在三月二十一日建议，以一九五一年十二月十八日交换的战俘名单为基础，确定双方释放并遣返其所收容的战俘的原则。由于你方一再明确表示愿在我方三月二十一日原则建议的轮廓内解决问题，同时鉴于双方收容的战俘中有原居住在收容者一方的事实，我方在三月二十七日提出了使双方战俘在停战后得以立即回家的折衷调整原则。我方三月二十七日折衷方案规定双方相互全部遣返南朝鲜军原居住在南朝鲜的被俘人员或朝鲜人民军原居住在北朝鲜的被俘人员，以及所有联合国军或中国人民志愿军被俘人员，朝鲜籍被俘人员原居住在收容者一方地区内者，如本人愿意在停战后直接回家，双方可以不予遣返。根据这项明白无误的调整原则，我方建议校正名单，确定双方遣返的概数。事实的经过全部记载在会议记录之内，不容曲解。我方为解决战俘问题作了如此重大的努力，但你方不仅没有作相应的努力，而且公然推翻你方愿在我方三月二十一日原则建议轮廓内解决问题的明确表示，使进一步的协商失去基础。最近你方更歪曲会议记录，诬指我方曾经同意过你方企图扣留战俘的所谓甄别，这是和这一会议的尊严完全不相称的彻头彻尾的谎言。历史上很少见过像你方这样背信弃义的行为，你方这样作，只能被认为是你方根本不愿解决战俘问题。我方五月二日的方案是一个完全合理的折衷方案，它保证双方战俘回家过和平生活，不再参加战争，它是由我方多次的重大让步形成的。我方方案的合理性是无可怀疑的。成千成万的战俘都渴望着立即回家，包括你方被俘人员在内。根据我方的方案战俘们在数星期以内就可以在回家途中。但自五月二日以来，你方在会内坚持扣留战俘的片面无理主张，拒绝进行任何谈判，在会外则不顾我方的一再抗议和世界人民的愤怒谴责，不断杀害战俘，故意制造紧张空气，使战俘问题的解决成为不可能。你方这种在会内外的公然挑衅行为，显然旨在阻挠战俘问题的解决，拖延停战谈判，阴谋扩大战争。为了在合理的基础上协商解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜的停战，我方已经作了多次的重大让步，提出了五月二日解决战俘问题的完全合理的折衷方案。我方在这个问题上所走的道路已超过一半以上，而你方却未作任何让步。如果你方是有意达成朝鲜停战而不是蓄意拖延停战谈判，你方就没有任何理由拒绝以我方的折衷方案为基础迅速解决战俘问题，实现朝鲜停战。”
