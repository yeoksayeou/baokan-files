Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: According to TASS: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting which opened on the 9th in Vienna concluded on the 14th. The meeting passed a letter to workers and staff, and a letter from the WFTU to the working people of all countries in support of the just struggle of the German and Japanese people for independence, freedom and democracy. The meeting also passed the following resolutions: resolution on the living conditions of the working people of North African countries; resolution on trade union participation in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference; resolution commemorating the International Day of Active Solidarity with the Korean People and Defense of Peace on June 25; resolution on defending, expanding and improving social insurance and social security.

At the closing session, Chairman Moreira said in his closing remarks: The strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions has greatly increased. Workers and staff in all countries unanimously believe that the WFTU is the heroic leader in their struggle to win their own needs. This is why the sympathy of millions of working people for the WFTU is increasing day by day. Moreira finally called on the working people to unite more closely and fight against the threat of war and for improved living conditions.

The meeting heard a report on the 13th by French General Confederation of Labour Secretary Renault on the fourth item on the agenda, "Preparing for the convening of a Social Protection and Insurance Conference." Renault described how, in capitalist countries, especially in the countries of the North Atlantic Group, due to the stepped-up arms race, funding for social protection and insurance has been sharply reduced, and the social insurance business is deteriorating. He also discussed the situation of the working people in colonial and dependent countries fighting for social protection and insurance. Renault said: Under these circumstances, it is necessary to convene an international social protection and insurance conference, which is planned to be held before the end of this year. The conference will exchange experiences gained by the working people of various countries in the struggle to promote social protection and insurance, and will consolidate the united front of workers and staff in the struggle for social welfare. When discussing Renault's report, representatives from Africa, the Soviet Union, Austria, Algeria, Czechoslovakia, China and other countries spoke successively, all pointing out the importance of convening this meeting. In his concluding remarks, Renault called on trade union organizations from all countries to actively participate in the preparatory work for this meeting.

    世界工会联合会执行局维也纳会议闭幕
    通过告各国劳动人民书支持德国和日本人民的斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社讯：九日在维也纳开幕的世界工会联合会执行局会议已在十四日闭幕。会议已通过了告工人和职员书以及世界工联为支持德国和日本人民争取独立自由与民主的正义斗争告各国劳动人民书。会议并通过下列各项决议：关于北非各国劳动人民生活情况的决议；关于工会参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议；关于纪念六月二十五日国际积极声援朝鲜人民和保卫和平日的决议；关于保卫、扩大和改进社会保险及社会安全的决议。
    在末次会议上担任主席的莫雷拉在致闭幕词时说：世界工联的力量已经大大地增长了。各国的工人和职员们一致认为世界工联是他们争取切身需要的斗争的英勇领导者。这就是千百万劳动人民对世界工联的同情日益增加的缘故。莫雷拉最后号召劳动人民更紧密地团结起来，进行反对战争威胁和争取改善生活条件的斗争。
    会议曾在十三日听取了法国总工会书记雷诺就第四项议程“筹备召开社会保护与保险会议”所作的报告。雷诺叙述了在资本主义国家中，尤其是在北大西洋集团的各国中，由于加紧备战，社会保护和保险的经费锐减，社会保险事业日益恶化的情形。他还论述了殖民地和附属国中劳动人民为要求社会保护与保险而斗争的情况。雷诺说：在这种情况下，召开国际社会保护和保险会议是必要的，这个会议打算在本年年底前举行。会议将交换各国劳动人民在增进社会保护与保险事业的斗争中已经获得的经验，并将巩固工人和职员在为社会福利而斗争中的联合阵线。在讨论雷诺的报告时，非洲、苏联、奥地利、阿尔及利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、中国等代表先后发言，他们都指出了召开这个会议的重要性。雷诺在总结发言中号召各国工会组织积极参加这个会议的筹备工作。
