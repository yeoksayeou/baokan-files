Letter from Soldiers of a Volunteer Army Company to the Mother of Martyr Wang Bolin

Editor: We are a company of the Volunteer Army. In Korea, we have been tested and tempered through various battles. In the harsh battles and difficult days, we are always receiving material and spiritual encouragement from our parents, brothers, wives, and sisters back home. In those difficult days, batches of comfort goods and a steady stream of慰问 letters were sent to us time and again. What precious gifts these are! They represent the Chinese people's enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea and their hope for us. Our hearts are always excited and moved by them. Every item, every word adds strength to us!

Recently, we received another batch of慰问 letters from all over the country. After reading them over and over, they filled us with confidence and courage. What touched us most was the letter from our dear mother – the mother of our comrade Wang Bolin.

Comrade Wang Bolin was a glorious Communist Party member, our close comrade-in-arms, and a young (22 years old) people's soldier. During the Fourth Campaign, when our company was tasked with the blocking mission at Uijeongbu, he and his platoon leader, after repelling several enemy assaults and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, heroically sacrificed themselves due to being outnumbered and running out of ammunition. We mourn this young, heroic comrade-in-arms with heavy hearts. We inherited his and all the martyrs' aspirations and completed the combat missions in the Fourth and Fifth Campaigns. Afterwards, we sent a death notice to his family. His mother wrote back to us in grief, and this letter gave great education and encouragement to every people's soldier. Our glorious mother was not overwhelmed by grief. She told us that she was proud of Bolin's glorious sacrifice for the country, and she was honored by the government's and the people's preferential treatment and respect. She instructed us to annihilate more enemies, and she expressed her determination to turn grief into strength and do more work for the motherland and the people. She wrote: "I am determined to work hard on sideline production as the mother of a glorious soldier, actively support you, and resolutely defeat all the enemies standing before us." This is a shining example for all the mothers of people's soldiers. We are proud to have such a glorious mother. The following is our reply to our dear mother, and we hope it can be published.

Dear Mother of Comrade Bolin – Our Glorious Mother:

We have received your letter of March 18th. After reading it over and over again, we couldn't help but shed tears of emotion, and we don't know what words to use to describe our excitement. In short, you have given us a lesson, and it is as if we are hearing the teachings of our own mother. You are a shining example of the mothers of our people's soldiers. You deserve to be our glorious mother.

Bolin – our close comrade-in-arms and excellent comrade – has bid farewell to you and us forever. Although his physical body has left us, his spirit and heroic image will live on forever and be immortal. They will always live in our hearts and the hearts of the people. Because he heroically sacrificed himself for peace and justice, for the motherland and the people. He exchanged his precious life for the victory of the battle and opened the road to victory. We will always remember him. You have lost your beloved son, but all the people's soldiers are your sons, and we are all your sons. Please rest assured! Please don't be too sad and upset! We who are alive will avenge you and demand a blood debt from the heinous American aggressors who took Bolin's precious life. We will definitely do as you wish.

There is no mother of all the good people in the world who does not love her son, and there is no one who does not want to live a peaceful and happy life, with mother and son reunited. However, the heinous American imperialists disregard justice and righteousness, and they launch wars of aggression with a complete lack of conscience and humanity. After their wars of aggression have repeatedly failed, they use bacteriological weapons. They place the vast majority of people in the pain and suffering of death, hunger, and cold. These hateful guys cannot see the strength of the people. They vainly attempt to drag human history backwards. By doing so, complete and utter ruin awaits them!

How strong and great are the strength of our motherland and the strength of the peace-loving people of the world! We will never let down the hopes of the people of the motherland and your hopes. We will devote ourselves to the struggle to win an early and victorious end to the Korean War.

Glorious Mother, we are your sons. If you want to know about the situation in Korea, we will write to you often in the future to inquire about your well-being.

Wishing you good health!

All the Soldiers of the Seventh Company, Third Battalion, a Certain Unit of the Volunteer Army

    志愿军某连战士给王伯林烈士母亲的信
    编辑同志：我们是志愿军的一个连队，在朝鲜经过历次战斗的考验和锻炼，我们在残酷战斗中和艰苦的日子里，总是受着祖国父母、兄弟、妻子、姐妹的物质与精神的鼓励。在那些艰苦的日子，成批的慰劳物品和源源不断的慰问信件，一次又一次地送到我们手里，这是多么珍贵的礼物啊！它代表着祖国人民抗美援朝的热情和对我们的希望。我们的心总是为它们而兴奋和激动。每一件东西、每一句话都给我们增加力量！
    最近我们又收到了来自祖国各地的一批慰问信。我们一遍又一遍地阅读以后，使我们信心百倍，勇气百倍。其中最使我们感动的，就是来自我们亲爱的母亲——我们战友王伯林的妈妈的那封信。
    王伯林同志是光荣的共产党员，是我们亲密的战友，是一个年青（年二十二岁）的人民战士。在四次战役中，我连担任议政府的阻击任务时，他和他的排长，在打垮了敌人数次冲锋，给敌人以大量杀伤后，因敌众我寡和弹尽援绝而壮烈地牺牲了。我们以沉痛的心情悼念着这位年青的英雄战友。我们继承着他和所有烈士的遗志，完成了四次战役和五次战役中历次的战斗任务。之后给他的家庭寄去讣告。他的母亲在悲痛中给我们写来了回信，这封信给我们每一个人民战士以很大的教育和鼓励。我们这位光荣的妈妈没有被悲痛压倒，她告诉我们，她为伯林的光荣殉国感到骄傲，她对政府和人民的优待与尊敬感到光荣。她嘱咐我们更多地歼灭敌人；而且她表示自己要化悲愤为力量，为祖国为人民做更多的工作。她写道：“我决心以一个光荣战士母亲的身份，努力搞好副业生产，积极支援你们，坚决打倒站在我们面前的一切敌人。”这是所有人民战士的母亲的光辉榜样。我们为我们有这样光荣的妈妈而感到骄傲。下面是我们写给我们亲爱的母亲的回信，希望能够发表。亲爱的伯林同志的母亲——我们光荣的妈妈：
    您三月十八日给我们来的信，我们已经收到了。我们一遍又一遍地阅读之后，不禁感动得热泪盈眶，不知道拿什么话语来形容我们激动的心情。总之，您给我们上了一课，我们仿佛是亲聆我们母亲的训诲。您是我们人民战士母亲的光辉榜样，您不愧为我们光荣的妈妈。
    伯林——我们亲密的战友和优秀的同志，他已经和您和我们永别了。他虽然肉体已经离开了我们，但他的精神和英雄的形象，是会与世长存、永垂不朽的，是会永远活在我们和人民的心里的。因为他是为和平和正义、为祖国和人民而壮烈牺牲的。他以自己宝贵的生命换取了战斗的胜利，开辟了胜利的大道。我们是永远记着他的。您失去了可爱的儿子，但所有的人民战士都是您的儿子，我们也都是您的儿子。请您放心吧！请您别过于悲伤和难过吧！我们这些活着的，是会给您报仇的，是会给您向夺去伯林宝贵生命的万恶难赦的美国侵略军讨还血债的。我们一定按照您的希望去做。
    全世界所有善良的人民的母亲，没有一个不痛爱自己的儿子，没有一个不愿过和平安乐，母子欢聚的生活。但是万恶的美帝国主义者置公理正义于不顾，他们丧尽天良灭绝人性地发动侵略战争。在它的侵略战争到处失利后，又使用细菌武器。它们置广大人民于死亡、饥饿、寒冷的痛苦和灾难之中。这些可恨的家伙，看不到人民的力量。它们妄想把人类历史向后拖。它们这样做，最后彻底的败亡在前面等着它们！
    我们祖国的力量和全世界和平人民的力量是多么雄厚和伟大啊！我们决不辜负祖国人民的希望和您的希望。我们一定为争取早日胜利结束朝鲜战争而献身奋斗。
    光荣的妈妈，我们就是您的儿子，如果您要了解朝鲜的情况的话，我们以后将经常给您写信，问安。
    祝您健康！
    志愿军某部三大队七连全体战士
    五月十六日
