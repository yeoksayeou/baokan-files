    The Soviet "Literary Gazette" published on May 13th a paper by Skatkin, Corresponding Academician of the Academy of Educational Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, discussing the phenomenon of excessive schoolwork. Here is a summary:

    The most important task of the school is to provide the growing generation with a general education, arming students with genuine scientific knowledge about nature, human society, and thought. The range of knowledge accumulated by science is vast. General education schools cannot and should not explain these sciences in their entirety. Undoubtedly, the task of the general school is to ensure a practical understanding of the basic knowledge of each science, that is, familiarity with the basic facts, laws, and theories of science, to hand students the key to understanding the phenomena studied by this or that scientific community, and to enable them to master the gateway to further in-depth study of this knowledge in higher education or through self-study. However, some educators engaged in compiling teaching plans and textbooks have forgotten these clear instructions from the Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) and strive to include in the school curriculum not only the basic knowledge of science, but also to include as complete and detailed a description of various sciences as possible in order to "not miss anything." According to these educators, because the scope of scientific knowledge is constantly expanding, the expansion of the scope of teaching plans and textbooks is inevitable, because teaching plans and textbooks cannot lag behind today's scientific level. This "theory" that attempts to prove the inevitability of the continuous expansion of school courses and the inability to eliminate the phenomenon of overburdened teaching plans and textbooks has thus arisen.

    If we follow this "theory," then with the rapid development of science, technology, literature, and art in our country, the scope of school courses will soon reach a point where it is too large to be completed in a lifetime. Obviously, this "theory" that the scope of general education courses is directly proportional to the corresponding range of scientific growth is unfounded. If such a wealth of knowledge is arranged according to this false so-called "theory," the result will inevitably be that teaching plans and textbooks are filled with trivial matters. If our educational science grew and developed as rapidly and fruitfully as our other sciences, it would have long shattered this erroneous "theory" and found a correct way out of this situation.

    However, educational science still lags behind life and has not yet been able to answer many critical questions, including the causes of students' excessive homework and the question of how to solve it.

    In his article "Do Not Overburden Students with Homework" published in the "Teacher's Newspaper," Russian Republic Deputy Minister of Education Orlov stated: "...For example, eighth-grade students (approximately fourteen years old) are often forced to spend no less than six or seven hours preparing homework after six hours of classes." This means that the working day of an eighth-grade student reaches twelve to thirteen hours, that is, far exceeding a graduate student's day of work.

    Free time is necessary for children to read interesting books, to go to the theater or concerts, and to engage in sports, music, radio technology, and other activities. All of this makes it possible for each student to develop his or her talents in the science, technology, art, etc. that he or she loves. The less free time, the less the possibility of developing personal hobbies and talents.

    If children are deprived of this possibility, "then it is very clear that most of the knowledge that students obtain from textbooks will disappear in practical life.... Of course, people who graduate from middle school can also become like pockets filled with knowledge, but this is not our goal. No, our goal is to enable middle school graduates to have a certain amount of knowledge and be able to apply it in practical life." (Kalinin)

    What are the real reasons for the excessive burden on students? Naturally, many teachers do arbitrarily expand the scope of the textbook material. But the basic reasons should still be found in the overburdened curriculum, teaching plans and textbooks, the imperfection of teaching methods, and the lack of due attention to improving teachers' abilities.

    Regarding this matter, the following example can prove to what extent the teaching plan is overburdened. In the ninth-grade literature teaching plan, there is a topic called "Belinsky." This topic is studied for six hours, and the issues that should be studied are stipulated as: "Belinsky is the founder of Russian realism criticism," "Belinsky's understanding of the nationality of literature," "Belinsky's view on the tasks of literature and art," "Belinsky as a materialist philosopher," and a total of fourteen such huge and serious issues.

    Now, more efforts are needed to improve teaching plans and textbooks.

    First of all, in each subject, facts, laws, and concepts must be precisely selected. We should not pursue a large number of facts, and we should not make students feel burdened by memorizing dates, numbers, names, and events. Stalin's A Short History of the CPSU(B) is an unparalleled example of such precise selection of leading situations and facts.

    The excessive burden is not only manifested in the broad scope of teaching plans and textbooks, but also in their excessive detail and the use of some terms that children of that age cannot understand. For example, ten-year-old children can encounter the following terms in the fourth-grade history textbook: corvée rent system, quit-rent system, aristocracy, senate, handicraft workshop, exploitation, Menshevik, trust, socialist property, educational qualifications, etc.

    The authors of textbooks casually use words such as "philosophy," "matter," "thought," "materialist," and "idealist," forgetting that what he is writing is for eleven-year-old children who cannot clearly understand these most abstract philosophical terms.

    The definite experience of editing some textbooks shows that the material in textbooks should be divided into two categories - material that must be memorized and supplementary material that expands horizons and satisfies children's desire for knowledge.

    Some may worry that dividing the material in textbooks into necessary and unnecessary will reduce the level of education. This worry is completely unfounded. The level of education will not only not be reduced, but will be improved. If we reduce the large amount of secondary narrative material that is reluctantly and mechanically memorized, we will ensure a more practical study of the most important facts and ideas of science, and we can develop children's independent thinking skills. A student's head should not become a reference book. Facts, events, dates, and names should be consolidated in the student's memory, but, as the Central Committee of the CPSU (Bolsheviks) has repeatedly emphasized in its resolutions on schools, the most important situations and facts that are necessary for a thorough understanding of conclusions and summaries should be memorized.

    Reasonably reducing teaching plans and textbooks will provide the possibility to study the learning materials more practically.

    论学校功课过重现象
    苏联“文学报”五月十三日发表了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦
    社会主义共和国教育科学院通讯院士斯卡特金所著论述
    学校功课过重现象的论文，摘要如下：
    学校最重要的任务，是使正在成长的一代受到普通教育，用关于自然、人类社会和思维的真正科学知识把学生武装起来。科学所积蓄的知识范围是非常广阔的。普通教育学校不可能而且也不应当全盘地阐述这些科学。无疑地，普通学校的任务，就是保证切实通晓每种科学的基本知识，即熟习科学的基本事实、法则和理论，就是把了解这种或那种科学团体所研究的现象的钥匙交给学生，使他们掌握在高等学校或用自修的方法进一步深入研究这些知识的门径。但是，某些从事编纂教学计划和教科书的教育学者们，把联共（布）中央委员会这些明确的指示忘记了，他们力求在学校的课程中不只是包括科学的基本知识，而是为了“什么东西都不放过”，尽可能包括各种科学的更完整更详尽的叙述。按照这些教育学家的意见来说，就是因为科学知识的范围在不断地扩大，所以，教学计划和教科书的范围的扩大也是不可避免的，因为教学计划和教科书不能落后于今天的科学水平。企图证明不断扩大学校课程的必然性和不能取消教学计划和教科书的过重现象的这种“理论”，就这样产生了。
    如果根据这种“理论”，那么在我国科学、技术、文学、艺术狂风暴雨般发展的情况下，学校的课程范围很快就会达到一生也学习不完的庞大程度。显然，这种普通教育课程范围与相应的科学增长范围成正比的“理论”，是没有根基的。如果依据这种虚伪的所谓“理论”来安排这样丰富的知识的话，结果就必然会使教学计划与教科书充满了琐碎事物。如果我们的教育科学也如同我们的其他科学一样成长并且发展得快而有成果的话，它早已粉碎了这种错误的“理论”，而且会从这种情况中找到正确的出路。
    但是，教育科学依旧落后于生活，而且至今对许多尖锐的问题都不能作答，其中包括学生功课过重的原因及其解决方法的问题。
    俄罗斯共和国教育部副部长奥尔洛夫在“教师报”上所发表的论文“不要用课外作业加重学生的负担”中说道：“……例如，八年级的小学生（约十四岁左右），在六个钟头的功课以后，经常被迫用不少于六、七个钟头的时间准备课外作业”。这就是说，八年级学生的工作日达到了十二——十三个钟点，也就是说，远远超过一位研究生的一天工作。
    为了让孩子们读有兴趣的书，常到剧院或音乐会，从事体育、音乐、无线电技术等活动，空闲时间对于他们是必要的。所有这些都能使每个学生有可能发展他在自己所爱好的那种科学、技术、艺术等方面的才能。空闲时间愈少，发展个人的爱好与才能的可能性则愈少。
    如果剥夺了孩子们的这种可能性，“那么学生们从课本中所得到的知识的大部分，都将在实际生活中不翼而飞是非常明显的……。当然，从中学毕业出来的人，也能够成为像填满了知识的一个口袋，但是这并不是我们的目的。不是的，我们的目的是使中学毕业出来的学生具有一定数量的知识并且能够在实际生活中运用它们。”（加里宁）
    学生们过重负担的真正原因究竟是什么呢？自然，有许多教师的确是任意扩大教材的范围。但是基本的原因仍应当在学习计划、教学计划和教科书的过重，教学方法的不完善，缺乏对提高教师能力应有的注意等方面来寻找。
    关于这件事情，下面的例子可以证明教学计划究竟过重到何种程度。在九年级的文学教学计划中有“柏林斯基”这样一个题目。这个题目学习六个钟点，规定应当研究的问题有：“柏林斯基是俄国写实主义批评的奠基者”，“柏林斯基对文学的民族性的理解”，“柏林斯基对文学与艺术的任务的看法”，“作为一位唯物主义哲学家的柏林斯基”等共十四个这样巨大的、严重的问题。
    现在为了改善教学计划与教科书，需要更多的努力。
    首先，在每种学课中，必须精密地选择事实、法则和概念。不应当追求大量的事实，不要使学生感到记忆日期、数字、名称、事件成为劳累的负担。斯大林的联共（布）党史简明教程，就是这种精密选择主导情况和事实的无可伦比的榜样。
    过重的负担不仅表现在教学计划和教科书的范围广阔方面，而也表现在它们的过分的详细和运用一些那种年龄的儿童所不能理解的术语方面。例如，十岁的儿童在四年级的历史教科书中可以遇见下面的术语：劳役租制，代役租，贵族，参议院，手工工场，剥削，孟什维克，托辣斯，社会主义的财产，教育资格等。
    教科书的作者随便运用“哲学”、“物质”、“思维”、“唯物主义者”、“观念论者”等词汇，而忘记了他所写的这些东西是供给一些尚不能清楚地了解这些最抽象的哲学名词的十一岁的小孩子们。
    编辑某些教科书的肯定经验，说明教科书的材料应分为两类——必须记忆的材料和扩大眼界与满足儿童求知欲的补充材料。
    有人可能忧虑，把教科书的材料分成必需的与不必需的，会使教育水平降低。这种忧虑是完全没有根据的。教育水平不仅不会降低，相反地是会提高的。如果减少勉强而机械记忆的大量次要的叙述材料，将会保证更切实地研究科学的最重要的事实和思想，并能发展儿童的独立思考力。学生的脑袋不应当变成参考书。事实、事件、日期和名称等，应当在学生的记忆中巩固起来，但是，正如联共（布）中央委员会关于学校的决议中曾屡次强调的，应当记忆那些对彻底了解结论与总结所必需的最重要的情况与事实。
    合理地减缩教学计划与教科书，会提供更切实地研究学习材料的可能性。
