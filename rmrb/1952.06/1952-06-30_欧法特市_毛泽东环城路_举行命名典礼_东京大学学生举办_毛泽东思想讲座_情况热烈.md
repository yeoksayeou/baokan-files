Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th. A mass rally was held in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, southwest of the German Democratic Republic, on the 26th to celebrate the naming ceremony of "Mao Zedong Ring Road." This road is located in the central business district of Erfurt, connecting Marx Square in the south and Lenin Street in the north, forming a two-and-a-half-kilometer semicircle, which is a merger of the original five streets.

    Erfurt Mayor Bock, who initially proposed naming the road after Mao Zedong, delivered a speech at the naming ceremony. He said: The Chinese people's anti-imperialist struggle and its victory have greatly encouraged the German people's struggle for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. In order to express their respect and admiration for Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, the 200,000 citizens of Erfurt decided to name one of the largest streets "Mao Zedong Ring Road."

    Li Xin, Counselor of the Chinese Diplomatic Mission to Germany, thanked the people of Erfurt for their kindness on behalf of the Chinese people. He said: Chairman Mao Zedong led the Chinese people onto the path of victory, peace, and friendship with all nations. The naming ceremony held in Erfurt today symbolizes the German people's path to peace, revival, and victory. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of Sino-German friendship and cooperation between the two countries in the common struggle against US imperialists.

    Erfurt is a picturesque city, the city in the German Democratic Republic that has preserved the most medieval buildings. Sixty-one years ago (October 1891), the German Social Democratic Party Congress passed the famous Erfurt Program in this city.

    [Xinhua News Agency] Tokyo News: Japanese students are increasingly interested in studying Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

    Students at the University of Tokyo recently organized a "Mao Zedong Thought Lecture Series," scheduled to run seven times from May 31st to June 21st. The first lecture was held on schedule on May 31st, with Professor Yoshitaro Hirano, Director of the China Research Institute, lecturing on "Mao Zedong's Theory of the State."

    欧法特市“毛泽东环城路”举行命名典礼
    东京大学学生举办“毛泽东思想讲座”情况热烈
    【新华社柏林二十八日电】德意志民主共和国西南部绍林吉亚州首府欧法特市二十六日召开群众大会，举行“毛泽东环城路”的命名典礼。这条路位于欧法特市中心商业区，南头接马克思广场，北面衔列宁街，形成一个两公里半的半圆，是把原来的五条街道合并而成的。
    当初倡议把这条路以毛泽东命名的欧法特市市长波克在命名典礼上发表演说，他说：中国人民所进行的反帝国主义斗争及其胜利，大大地鼓舞了德国人民争取统一、独立、民主、爱好和平的德国的斗争。为了对中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席表示尊崇和景仰，欧法特市的二十万市民决定把一条最大的街道命名为“毛泽东环城路”。
    中国驻德外交使团参赞李欣代表中国人民感谢欧法特市人民的盛意。他说：毛泽东主席领导中国人民走上了胜利、和平与各民族友好的道路。欧法特市今天举行的命名典礼象征着德国人民走向和平、复兴和胜利的道路。他在演说中着重指出中德友好和两国在反对美帝国主义者的共同斗争中进行合作的重要性。
    欧法特市是一个风景如画的城市，它是德意志民主共和国所有的城市中保留中古建筑物最多的一个城市。六十一年以前（一八九一年十月），德国社会民主党代表大会就是在这个城里通过了有名的欧法特计划。
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本学生研究马克思—列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想的兴趣日益增长。
    东京大学的学生最近举办了一个“毛泽东思想讲座”，计划从五月三十一日起到六月二十一日止开讲七次。第一讲已按期于五月三十一日举行，由中国研究所所长平野义太郎主讲“毛泽东的国家理论”，听讲的人十分踊跃，会场拥挤不堪。
    第二讲的情况也极热烈。这一讲的题目是“毛泽东的民族解放理论”，由日中友好协会理事岩村三千夫担任讲师。听众踊跃地提出各项问题要求解答，表现了他们对毛泽东思想的浓重的兴趣。
    据悉，日本各学校也准备分别举办关于毛泽东思想的演讲会或研究会。
