The Improvement of the Material and Cultural Living Standards of Railway Workers
Tie Gong

New China is leaping forward, and the material and cultural lives of railway workers are also growing daily.

In the past two years, the welfare of railway workers has greatly improved with the development of production. From August 1950 to the end of 1951, 127,828 railway workers nationwide enjoyed labor insurance, various relief funds, subsidies, and other benefits, receiving a total of 39.02 billion yuan in labor insurance funds. In terms of various collective welfare undertakings, 52 sanatoriums and rest homes have been established or are being established, with an expected capacity of 4,132 beds; 22,457 employees received sanatorium and rest home care last year. The total amount of labor insurance funds allocated by the People's Government to the trade unions for direct control has been increasing year by year: 40.48 billion yuan in 1950, 68.58 billion yuan in 1951, and the budget for 1952 has increased to 75 billion yuan. In addition, the funds directly paid by the administrative side according to the provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations, such as medical expenses for employees injured on duty, wages during medical treatment, wages for female employees during maternity leave, medical expenses for illnesses of directly dependent relatives of employees, and medical expenses, are also increasing year by year. Among them, the medical expenses alone were 36.504 billion yuan in 1950, 83.6352 billion yuan in 1951, and the budget for 1952 has been increased to 120.84 billion yuan under the condition that the national prices are basically stable.

In terms of labor protection, according to the statistics of five railway administrations in the north and south, there are 12,184 places where safety equipment needs to be installed on all machinery. By the end of 1951, 7,080 places had been installed, accounting for 58.1% of the total number to be installed. In 1951, the People's Government allocated a special fund of 53.4 billion yuan to improve the safety and hygiene equipment of railway workers. At present, most of the protective equipment and clothing required by railway workers have been resolved; technical safety equipment on machinery, such as protective fences and gear covers, has been installed in more than 75.1% of the total number required; and production hygiene equipment, such as ventilation, lighting, drinking water, and bathhouses, have also been largely resolved.

Due to the importance attached by the government and trade unions to workers' labor insurance and labor protection, the number of illnesses and deaths among railway workers has decreased year by year since liberation. In 1951, the number of railway workers nationwide who took sick leave decreased by 19% compared with 1950; in 1951, the number of railway workers nationwide who took leave due to work-related injuries decreased by 23% compared with 1950.

In the past two years, the People's Government has taken a series of effective measures to guarantee and improve the material life of railway workers. Take wages as an example: in the early days of the national liberation in 1949, even under the extremely difficult financial situation of the country, employees were still given wages that could at least maintain the lives of two and a half people; after gradual adjustments, by the first half of 1951, wages were much higher than those during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and the material life of employees had been unprecedentedly improved. After the nationwide railway wage adjustment in August 1951, the total wage fund for employees increased by 10%, and the material living standards of employees were further improved. In addition, income from excess rewards in production competitions and invention awards also directly improved the material living standards of employees. At present, more than 90% of railway workers nationwide use fine grains as their staple food.

With the improvement of economic life, the political and cultural life of employees has also been further improved. By the end of 1951, 200,000 railway workers nationwide had participated in cultural learning; nearly half of the workers had participated in political learning; and about one-third of the workers had participated in technical learning. In the past two years, the railway workers nationwide have had glorious performances and achieved brilliant victories in various great political movements. Through the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and democratic reform movements, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit spies and feudal remnants lurking in the people's railways have been basically eliminated. In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the political consciousness of railway workers nationwide has been generally improved. In 1951, more than 90% of railway workers nationwide signed patriotic pacts; a total of 27 fighter planes were donated. More than 75% of railway workers nationwide volunteered to work on the front lines in Korea; more than 85% of the workers on the front lines in Korea were commended for their meritorious service. In the great "Three-Anti" movement, railway workers victoriously repelled the rampant attacks of illegal capitalist elements on the people's railways in the past three years, exposed and eliminated the economic erosion of the bourgeoisie, criticized and liquidated the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, purified the trade union organizations, and consolidated the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party over the people's railways.

In the field of literature and art, railway workers have also fully demonstrated their wisdom and talent. Following "Not a Cicada" created by Wei Lianzhen, a worker from the Shijiazhuang Inspection and Repair Section, many railway worker writers have created many good works.

In 1951, railway workers nationwide created a total of 240 literary and artistic works. Among them, those writing about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea include "Dad's Good Son" and "Turn Grief into Strength"; those writing about suppressing counter-revolutionaries include "Repentance is Salvation"; those writing about preferential treatment work include "Family of Honor"; and those writing about economic accounting include "Welcoming the Red Flag" and "Let's Calculate." These scripts were performed in 10 cultural and art troupes and 933 amateur theater troupes across the country, and were warmly welcomed by the majority of employees.

Sports activities of railway workers have also developed. In April 1951, the national railways held basketball and volleyball competitions, in July, a training class for sports cadres was held, in September, a football competition was held, and the sports propaganda train traveled to various places twice to carry out propaganda, which greatly promoted the new mass sports movement serving production and national defense construction. In 1951, the number of people participating in sports activities reached 200,000. Radio calisthenics is also booming.

According to preliminary statistics, in the past two years, trade union organizations at all levels of the national railways have established 10 cultural and art troupes, 1,047 cultural palaces, clubs (rooms), 933 amateur theater troupes, 56 projection teams, 838 libraries (rooms), and 4 cultural trains. 5,830 units have established regular blackboards, and 1,727 units have built sports fields.

At present, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" struggle, railway workers nationwide are enthusiastically launching the full-load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement. With the development of the movement, the material and cultural lives of railway workers will be further improved. (Reprinted from the fifth issue of the People's Railway Magazine)

    铁路工人物质和文化生活水平的提高
    铁工
    新中国在飞跃前进，铁路工人的物质和文化生活也在日益增长。
    两年多来，铁路工人的福利事业，随着生产的发展有了很大的改进。从一九五零年八月到一九五一年末，全国铁路已经有职工十二万七千八百二十八人享受了劳动保险、各种救济费和补助费等待遇，共得到劳动保险金三百九十亿二千万元。在各种集体福利事业方面，已建立和正在建立的各种疗养院和休养所有五十二处，预计可容纳病床四千一百三十二张；去年一年中得到疗养和休养的职工有二万二千四百五十七人。人民政府拨交工会直接掌握的劳动保险金总额是逐年增加的：一九五零年为四百零四亿八千万元，一九五一年为六百八十五亿八千万元，一九五二年的预算增加到七百五十亿元。此外，根据劳动保险条例的规定由行政方面直接支付的款项，如职工负伤医疗费、医疗期间的工资、女工产假期间的工资、职工供养直系亲属疾病医疗费、医务经费等，也在逐年增加。其中医药费一项，一九五零年为三百六十五亿零四百万元，一九五一年为八百三十六亿三千五百二十万元，在全国物价基本稳定的情况下，一九五二年的预算又增加为一千二百零八亿四千万元。
    在劳动保护方面，根据北方、南方五个铁路管理局的统计，全部机械需要安装安全设备的有一万二千一百八十四处，到一九五一年底止，已安装了七千零八十处，占应安装总数的百分之五十八点一。在一九五一年，人民政府曾拨出了五百三十四亿元的专款，作为改善铁路工人安全卫生设备的费用。目前，铁路工人所需用的防护用品和防护服装，已大部分得到解决；机械上的技术安全设备，如防护栏、齿轮罩等，已安装了需要总台数的百分之七十五点一以上；生产卫生设备，如通风、照明、饮水、浴池等，也都大部分得到了解决。
    由于政府和工会重视了工人的劳动保险和劳动保护事业，解放以来铁路职工疾病伤亡的人数逐年降低。一九五一年全国铁路职工因病请假的人数，比一九五零年减少百分之十九；一九五一年全国铁路职工因工伤请假的人数，比一九五零年减少了百分之二十三。
    两年多来，人民政府对保障和改善铁路职工的物质生活采取了一连串的有效措施。拿工资来说：一九四九年全国解放初期，在国家财政极端困难的情况下，仍给予职工至少能维持两口半人生活的工资；经过逐步调整，到一九五一年上半年度，工资即比国民党反动统治时期高出许多，职工的物质生活获得了空前的改善。在一九五一年八月全国铁路普遍调整工资后，职工的工资基金总额增加了百分之十，职工的物质生活水平进一步提高。此外，在生产竞赛中的超额奖励和创造发明奖金等收入，也都直接提高了职工的物质生活水平。目前全国铁路职工以细粮作主食的已达百分之九十以上。
    随着经济生活的改善，职工的政治文化生活也有了进一步的改进。到一九五一年底为止，全国铁路职工参加文化学习的达二十万人；有近半数的工人参加了政治学习；约有三分之一的工人参加了技术学习。两年多来，在各个伟大的政治运动中，全国铁路职工有过光辉的表现，获得了辉煌的胜利。经过镇压反革命和民主改革运动，基本上肃清了潜伏在人民铁道中的蒋匪特务和封建残余势力。在抗美援朝运动中，全国铁路职工的政治觉悟普遍提高。一九五一年全国铁路职工有百分之九十以上的人订立了爱国公约；共捐献了二十七架战斗机。全国铁路职工百分之七十五以上志愿要求到朝鲜前线工作；在朝鲜前线的职工有百分之八十五以上的人立了功。在伟大的“三反”运动中，铁路职工胜利地打退了不法资产阶级分子三年来对人民铁道的猖狂进攻，揭发和清除了资产阶级的经济侵蚀，批判和清算了资产阶级的思想影响，纯洁了工会组织，巩固了工人阶级和共产党对人民铁道的领导。
    在文艺方面，铁路工人也充分显示了自己的智慧和才能。继石家庄检车段工人魏连珍创作的“不是蝉”之后，很多铁路工人作家创造了许多好作品。
    一九五一年全国铁路职工共创作了二百四十种文艺作品。其中写抗美援朝的有“爸爸的好儿子”、“化悲愤为力量”；写镇压反革命的有“回头是岸”；写优抚工作的有“光荣之家”；写经济核算的有“迎红旗”、“算一算”。这些剧本在全国十个文工团和九百三十三个业余剧团中演出，受到了广大职工的热烈欢迎。
    铁路职工的体育运动也有了发展。一九五一年四月全国铁路举行篮球、排球比赛，七月举办体育干部训练班，九月举行足球比赛，体育宣传列车曾两次开往各地进行宣传，对开展为生产和国防建设服务的新的群众体育运动起了很大的推动作用。一九五一年参加体育活动的人数已达到二十万人。广播体操运动也正在蓬勃地开展中。
    根据初步统计，两年多来全国铁路各级工会组织，共建立了文工团十个，文化宫、俱乐部（室）
    一千零四十七个，业余剧团九百三十三个，放映队五十六个，图书馆（室）八百三十八个，文化列车四个。五千八百三十个单位建立了经常的黑板报，一千七百二十七个单位修筑了运动场。
    目前全国铁路工人在“三反”斗争胜利的基础上，正热烈地展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动。随着运动的发展，铁路工人的物质文化生活将会进一步提高。         （转载人民铁道杂志第五期）
