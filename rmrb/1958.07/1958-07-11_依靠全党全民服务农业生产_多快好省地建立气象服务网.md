    Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 10th: The Third National Meteorological Work Conference proposed that meteorological work must put politics in command, resolutely rely on the power of the whole party and all the people, and establish a meteorological service network focusing on agricultural services quickly, well, and economically throughout the country.
    The Third National Meteorological Work Conference was held in Guilin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, for eleven days starting from June 29th. More than 190 representatives from meteorological bureaus of various provinces and autonomous regions participated in the meeting. Before the meeting, the representatives visited the Yulin, Luodong, Shatang, and Nanning stations.
    After several years of active construction, China's meteorological work had 1,635 meteorological stations at all levels by 1957, an increase of 416% compared with 1952. The number of meteorological workers has also increased three and a half times compared with 1952. The development of meteorological stations has guaranteed the needs of agricultural production and broken the superstitious ideas of farmers. In recent years, the Guangxi Meteorological Bureau and its affiliated stations have closely cooperated with the production-centered tasks of the Party committees at all levels in each period, and actively done a good job in forecasting and information services, so that farmers not only use weather forecasts and warnings to prevent natural disasters, but also apply forecasts to choose favorable opportunities and implement production increase measures.
    In the high tide of the agricultural Great Leap Forward, farmers across the country urgently demand that meteorological science can serve production more closely. Faced with this demand, the conference requested that all provinces and autonomous regions conscientiously rely on the leadership of the local Party committees, mobilize the strength of the whole people, and realize "every special district has a meteorological station, every county has a meteorological station, every township has a meteorological post, and every commune has a weather watching group," forming a nationwide meteorological service network. After the establishment of each meteorological station, post, it is necessary to immediately carry out service work, and achieve "every township has forecasts, every commune uses forecasts, and everyone believes in forecasts," so that meteorological work can take root among the masses.
    The conference believes that it is necessary to promote the single-station supplementary forecast experience of Zhenxiong Climate Station in Yunnan Province in all meteorological stations, posts, and climate stations across the country. The main experience of Zhenxiong Climate Station is to widely collect folk songs and proverbs related to weather changes and the experience of the masses in observing the weather, and gradually accumulate a set of experience. According to the local weather characteristics, they have improved the accuracy rate of 24-hour short-term forecasts from 60% to 90.3% in more than a year. The view that meteorological science is very mysterious and difficult to master is incorrect, and the fact proves that the use of mass experience is a very effective way to improve the scientific and technological level of meteorology. The conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to resolutely implement the combination of meteorological scientific theory and practice in order to create a set of theories and methods of meteorological work suitable for China's geographical conditions.
    During the Third National Meteorological Work Conference, the Central Meteorological Bureau also held a symposium on marine hydrological and meteorological work in the seven coastal provinces and Shanghai.

    依靠全党全民服务农业生产
    多快好省地建立气象服务网
    据新华社桂林10日电　第三次全国气象工作会议提出，气象工作必须政治挂帅，坚决依靠全党全民的力量，多快好省地在全国范围内建立一个以农业服务为重点的气象服务网。
    第三次全国气象工作会议从6月29日起，在广西僮族自治区桂林市开了十一天。参加会议的有各省、自治区气象局代表一百九十多人。会前，代表们曾经分别到玉林、洛东、沙塘和南宁等台、站参观。
    我国的气象事业，经过几年来的积极建设，到1957年已有各级气象台、站一千六百三十五个，比1952年增加了416％。气象工作人员也比1952年增加三倍半。气象台、站的发展，保证了农业生产的需要和破除了农民的迷信思想。广西气象局及其所属各台、站，几年来紧密地配合各级党委各时期的生产中心任务，积极做好预报和资料服务等工作，使农民不仅利用天气预报、警报来防御自然灾害，并进而应用预报来选择有利时机，贯彻增产措施。
    全国各地农民在农业大跃进的高潮中，迫切要求气象科学能够更紧密地为生产服务。面对这个要求，会议要求各省、自治区认真依靠当地党委领导，动员全民力量，实现“专专（区）有气象台、县县有气象站、乡乡有气象哨、社社有看天小组”，形成一个全国性的气象服务网。各气象台、站建立之后，要立即开展服务工作，做到“乡乡有预报、社社用预报、人人信预报”，使气象事业在群众中落地生根。
    会议认为有必要在全国各气象站、哨和气候站，推广云南省镇雄气候站的单站补充预报经验。镇雄气候站的主要经验是广泛收集流传于民间的有关天气变化的歌谣、谚语，和群众观测天气的经验，逐渐积累了一套经验。他们根据地方天气特点，使二十四小时短期预报准确率，在一年多时间里，从60％提高到90.3％。那种把气象科学看成很神秘、很难掌握，而事实证明：运用群众经验是提高气象科学技术水平很有效的途径。会议认为：今后必须坚决贯彻气象科学理论与实践相结合，以创造出一套适合于我国地理条件的气象工作的理论和方法。
    在第三次全国气象工作会议召开期间，中央气象局另外召开了沿海七省及上海市海洋水文气象工作座谈会。
