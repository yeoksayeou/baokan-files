Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 4th: The Mongolian "Truth News" published a commentary today entitled "Tito's Attacks are Groundless," refuting Tito's speech in Labin on June 15th and condemning Tito's abuse and slander of various communist parties.

The commentary said that it is completely correct for the Chinese Communist Party, which has rich experience in long-term revolutionary struggle, and other communist parties to conduct thorough, just, and relentless criticism of Yugoslav revisionism. Tito's shameless attacks on them cannot hide his revisionist face of opposing socialism. The commentary said that Tito actually used words like "American wheat is no worse than the Soviet wheat we didn't get" to praise "American aid." American imperialism believes that Tito is helpful to their conspiracy to undermine the world communist movement, so they also praise Tito. The commentary pointed out that the Tito elements are the "Voice of America" and agents of imperialism in the guise of a "socialist country." They are cloaked in communism and attempt to carry out divisive activities against socialist countries that are closely united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. However, they will never achieve their goals.

The commentary pointed out that Yugoslav revisionists not only endanger the international communist movement, but also greatly harm the cause of peace and the struggle of Asian and African peoples against imperialism and colonialism. The commentary said that Tito keeps shouting about "defending peace" and "coexistence," but why did his speech in Labin sow the seeds of national hatred among the people of various countries? Tito's attempt is not difficult to understand. This is a conspiracy to undermine the friendship between the people of Yugoslavia and the people of socialist countries. Under the pretext of opposing the division of the world into two camps, Tito attempts to undermine the broad front of people of all countries against war, imperialism, and colonialism, and further undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. He attempts to steal the slogan of "coexistence" to deceive the people of all countries, make the people of Asian and African countries give up the struggle against imperialism, isolate socialist countries, and weaken their strength. The real purpose of Tito's so-called peace policy lies in this.

The commentary concluded that the Soviet Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party, and the communist parties of various countries have thoroughly criticized Yugoslav revisionists from both theoretical and practical perspectives, and thoroughly exposed their true colors and essence, making it impossible for Tito revisionists to carry out any activities in the international workers' movement. Any attempt by them to undermine the cause of socialism will not be realized.

    蒙“真理报”斥铁托反动演说
    铁托对各国共产党的批判进行无耻的攻击  说明他是披着共产主义外衣的“美国之音”
    新华社乌兰巴托4日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表题为“铁托的攻击是毫无根据的”的评论，驳斥铁托6月15日在拉宾发表的演说，谴责铁托对各国共产党的谩骂和诽谤。
    评论说，富有长期革命斗争经验的中国共产党和其他各国共产党对南共修正主义进行彻底的、严正的、无情的批判完全是正确的。铁托对它们进行无耻的攻击，并不能掩饰他的反对社会主义的修正主义嘴脸。评论说，铁托居然用“美国的小麦并不比我们没有得到的苏联的小麦差”这样的话来颂扬“美援”。美帝国主义认为铁托对他们的破坏世界共产主义运动的阴谋有帮助，所以他们也颂扬铁托。评论指出，铁托分子是以“社会主义国家”为外衣的“美国之音”和帝国主义代理人。他们披着共产主义外衣，企图向在马克思列宁主义旗帜下和无产阶级国际主义原则下紧密团结起来的社会主义国家进行分裂活动。但是，他们无论如何是达不到目的的。
    评论指出，南共修正主义者不仅危害国际共产主义运动，并且对和平事业和亚非各国人民的反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的斗争也有极大危害性。评论说，铁托口口声声叫嚷“保卫和平”、“共处”，但他在拉宾的演说为什么在各国人民中散播民族仇恨的种子呢？铁托的这种企图是不难理解的。这是阴谋破坏南斯拉夫人民和各社会主义国家人民的友谊。铁托在所谓反对把世界分裂为两个阵营的借口下，企图破坏各国人民反对战争、反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的广阔阵线，并进一步破坏苏联、中国及各社会主义国家的威信。他企图盗用“共处”的口号来欺骗各国人民，使亚非各国人民放弃反对帝国主义的斗争，孤立社会主义国家并削弱它们的力量。铁托的所谓和平政策的真正目的就在于此。
    评论最后指出，苏联共产党、中国共产党以及各国共产党从理论和实际出发彻底地批判了南共修正主义者，彻底地揭露他们的原形和本质，已使铁托修正主义分子在国际工人运动中毫无活动的余地。他们妄想破坏社会主义事业的任何企图都是不能实现的。
