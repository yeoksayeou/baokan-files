Burning Anger in My Heart
Fan Yiben, Worker at the Beijing State-Owned Cotton Textile United Factory

The first furnace of steel is about to be tapped, and the workers' anger pours in from outside the steel window: the jackal's claws creep onto Arab land, and the butcher slaughters Arab brothers. Anger burns in my heart, and the blood all over my body is like boiling steel! Anger burns in my heart, my chest is like a newly coaled furnace! The angry furnace fire burns more and more fiercely, and it will fly to the Middle East to burn the invading army to death! The furnace bar is pulled out, redder than molten iron, and I will use it to pierce the jackal's heart! I pick up the steel bar and poke the furnace hearth hard, I want to refine this furnace of steel to support the Middle East! As long as the Arab brothers shout, I will immediately put down the steel bar, pick up my weapon, and charge!

    怒火烧在心头
    北京国棉联合厂工人　范以本第一炉钢水快要出炉，从钢窗外涌来工人们的愤怒：豺狼的魔爪爬上阿拉伯土地，屠夫在砍杀阿拉伯弟兄。怒火烧在我的心头，周身的血液像沸腾的钢水！怒火烧在我的心头，我的胸膛像刚加煤的熔炉！愤怒的炉火越烧越怒，它要飞向中东去烧死侵略军！炉扦拔出比铁水还红，我要拿它去戳穿豺狼的心！我拿起钢扦使劲通一通炉膛，我要炼好这炉钢支援中东！只要阿拉伯弟兄一声呼喊，我立刻放下钢扦拿起武器冲
  锋！
