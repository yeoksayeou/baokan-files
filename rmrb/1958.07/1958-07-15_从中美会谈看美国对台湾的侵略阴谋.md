From the Sino-US Talks, See the US Conspiracy to Invade Taiwan
    Xiao Yi
    Eight years ago, the United States used force to occupy our territory of Taiwan, seriously damaging the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty. Since then, the US occupation of Taiwan has become a key issue in Sino-US relations. In order to peacefully resolve international disputes between China and the United States and to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area, the Chinese government agreed to hold ambassadorial-level talks with the US government in Geneva. However, the course of the nearly three years of Sino-US talks has proved that the United States has absolutely no sincerity in improving Sino-US relations and easing international tensions; it is merely playing various rogue tactics at the negotiating table to achieve its imperialist aggressive goals.
    People all over the world know that Taiwan has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. After the liberation of China, the new China inherited all of China's territory and sovereignty, which is an indisputable fact. The reason why Taiwan has not yet returned to the jurisdiction of the Chinese government today is entirely due to US interference and obstruction. The tension in the Taiwan area is entirely caused by US aggression and interference. It is not China that is using force and military threats in the Taiwan area, but the United States.
    China has consistently advocated that China and the United States should resolve disputes between the two countries, especially the tense situation in the Taiwan area, through consultation rather than the use of force. As early as during the Asian-African Conference in Bandung in 1955, China made clear and positive statements in Bandung. Therefore, when the US side requested the issuance of a joint statement by China and the United States on "renouncing the use of force" at the Sino-US talks, China did not object to issuing a joint statement based on the spirit stipulated in the United Nations Charter.
    However, since the United States has already used force to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, and has stationed the Seventh Fleet near Taiwan for a long time, threatening the Chinese people and creating tension in the Taiwan area, if China and the United States are to issue a statement on "renouncing the use of force," it must lead to the lifting of the force already used by the United States in the Taiwan area and the easing and elimination of the resulting tension, and must never be used to make China recognize the status quo of the US occupation of Taiwan. The United States attempts to use the principle of "the two countries not using force to resolve disputes" as a guise to actually freeze the status quo in the Taiwan area, make China recognize the legality of its occupation of Taiwan, and interfere with China's exercise of sovereignty in this area, which the Chinese people will never allow under any circumstances.
    The US side also proposed at the Sino-US talks that the United States should exercise the so-called "individual or collective right of self-defense" on Chinese territory in Taiwan. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and there is no question of the United States carrying out so-called "self-defense" against China on Chinese territory, nor does the so-called defense issue arise at all. Since the United States has already carried out military occupation of China in Taiwan, if we talk about defense, then only China has the right to defend itself and drive out this military occupation.
    The US government also absurdly attempts to use the so-called US-Chiang "common defense treaty" as an excuse for the United States to carry out "self-defense" and "defense" on Chinese territory in Taiwan. As everyone knows, the US-Chiang "common defense treaty" itself is an infringement on China's sovereignty and interference in China's internal affairs by US imperialism, and is therefore completely illegal. Only China can exercise the right of self-defense on its own territory of Taiwan. This is a fundamental principle of international law, which the United States is not allowed to distort; this is also the firm position of the Chinese people, which will never waver in the slightest!
    In the process of the Sino-US talks, our side put forward a series of reasonable proposals for peacefully resolving disputes between the two countries without resorting to force, and suggested holding a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan area. The plan put forward by our side at the meeting on October 27, 1955, suggested that China and the United States specifically mention in the statement that they would resolve disputes between the two countries in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations without resorting to force, and at the same time clearly stipulate that a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting should be held to enable this statement to be realized. On December 1, 1955, our side put forward another plan, stipulating that China and the United States should first issue a principled statement on peacefully resolving disputes between the two countries without resorting to force, and then the ambassadors of the two countries should continue to hold talks to seek specific ways to realize this common aspiration. In view of the long-term delay in the talks by the United States, our side put forward a new plan on May 11, 1956, suggesting that China and the United States announce in the statement that they would peacefully resolve disputes between the two countries in the Taiwan area without resorting to force, and at the same time stipulate that within a certain period of time after the statement was issued, they should seek and determine ways to realize this aspiration, including a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting.
    However, the US side opposed determining a Sino-US foreign ministers' meeting to implement the principle of not using force in the Taiwan area, and refused to seek ways to peacefully resolve disputes between China and the United States within a certain period of time. It only stubbornly insisted that China "renounce the use of force" in the Taiwan area and recognize its so-called "self-defense" rights in Taiwan in order to achieve its goal of infringing on China's sovereignty and interfering in China's internal affairs. The Sino-US talks could not make any progress under the unilateral sabotage of the United States.
    Despite the Chinese government and the Chinese people constantly exposing the US conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Sino-US talks, and repeatedly warning the United States that it must abandon its policy of using force and military threats in the Taiwan area, the United States has continued to step up its aggression and control over China's territory of Taiwan, and continued to maintain and aggravate the tension in the Taiwan area.
    In order to completely turn Taiwan into a US colony and a US base for launching atomic warfare, the United States announced in May 1957 that it would station US air force units equipped with missiles in Taiwan, and moved "Matador" missile units to Taiwan. In April 1958, a US Department of Defense official announced that the United States was "studying" a plan to establish medium-range missile bases in the Far East, and Taiwan and South Korea were "among the first to be considered." In May 1958, the United States secretly tested the launch of "Matador" missiles in Taiwan. The US aggressive act of establishing missile bases in Taiwan not only exposes its conspiracy to occupy Taiwan for a long time and intimidate the Chinese people, but also proves that it is further turning Taiwan into a military base in the Far East, stepping up nuclear arms race, and using the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a tool to expand its aggression against Asian countries. This is a threat to the security of the Asian people.
    For three years, the United States has been reorganizing the Chiang army, making it completely a US mercenary army. In December 1955, the US and Chiang signed a "reserve and replenishment system plan" for the Chiang army, stipulating that the United States would assist the Chiang Kai-shek clique in establishing nine reserve divisions. In April 1958, the US Department of Defense announced that it would reorganize the Chiang army "within a few months" in accordance with the current US general military plan "in order to meet the needs of atomic warfare," and would organize five "atomic divisions" within the Chiang army.
    In order to completely place all actions of the Chiang army under the direct control of the Americans, the United States reorganized and strengthened its military aggressive institutions stationed in Taiwan. In May 1958, the United States merged its seventeen subordinate aggressive institutions stationed in Taiwan, such as the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group," the "US Taiwan Defense Command," into the "US Taiwan Defense Assistance Command," with Doyle as the commander-in-chief, who is the supreme commander of the US and Chiang armies in the Taiwan area. On May 18, Doyle blatantly stated that the task of the headquarters was to "defend Taiwan against possible attacks from the Chinese mainland communists," and also said that it would obstruct our liberation of the coastal islands.
    The United States uses Taiwan as a base and the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a tool to carry out subversive activities in Southeast Asian countries seeking national independence, and rudely interferes in the internal affairs of these countries. Its aggressive behavior in Indonesia is the latest example. When the Indonesian rebel group carried out armed rebellion with the support of the United States, the United States transported various light and heavy weapons, military aircraft and aircraft gasoline to the rebels entrenched in North Sulawesi through Taiwan; it directed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to send military and secret service personnel to directly participate in the military operations of the rebels; US-made aircraft piloted by members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique bombed several areas in the eastern part of Indonesian territory. The US blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs has been unanimously condemned by peace-loving and justice-advocating people all over the world.
    For three years, the United States has been planning to organize a Northeast Asian anti-communist military alliance in an attempt to complete the so-called "northern link of the anti-communist chain" surrounding China and the Soviet Union. Recently, under the instructions of the United States, the Japanese government is stepping up its planning of a "Northeast Asian Anti-Communist Alliance" composed of US puppet groups such as Nobusuke Kishi, Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem. Japan and South Korea are negotiating on this issue. Asian peace-loving countries and people must be vigilant against this political and military conspiracy.
    The Chinese people love peace, the Chinese people do not want to fight with the United States, and the Chinese government is willing to sit down and negotiate with the US government. However, Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Taiwan must be liberated. The Chinese people will never allow the United States to attempt to achieve its goal of occupying Taiwan for a long time through the Sino-US talks, nor will they allow the United States to delay the Sino-US talks for a long time to cover up its aggressive acts of occupying Taiwan.

    从中美会谈看美国对台湾的侵略阴谋
    小宜
    八年前，美国用武力侵占了我国领土台湾，严重地破坏了中国领土和主权的完整。自从那时起，美国侵占台湾问题便成为中美关系中的关键问题。为了和平解决中美之间的国际争端，和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势，中国政府同意和美国政府在日内瓦举行中美大使级会谈。但是，将近三年的中美会谈的经过证明，美国完全没有诚意改善中美关系，和缓国际紧张局势；它只是在会议桌上耍弄各种无赖手段，以达到它的帝国主义的侵略目的。
    全世界人民都知道，台湾从来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分。中国解放后，新中国继承了全部中国的领土和主权，这是不容争辩的事实。台湾之所以到今天还没有回到中国政府的管辖下，完全是由于美国的干涉和阻挠。台湾地区的紧张局势完全是美国的侵略和干涉所造成的。在台湾地区使用武力和进行军事威胁的不是中国，而是美国。
    中美两国不使用武力而以协商方法解决两国之间的争端，特别是台湾地区紧张局势的问题，是中国一贯的主张。早在1955年亚非会议期间，中国就在万隆作出了明确、积极的表示。因此，当美方在中美会谈的会议上要求发表中美双方“放弃使用武力”的声明时，中国并不反对发表一个以联合国宪章规定的精神为基础的共同声明。
    但是，由于美国已经使用武力侵占了中国领土台湾，把第七舰队长期摆在台湾附近，威胁中国人民，造成了台湾地区的紧张局势，中美双方如果要发表关于“放弃使用武力”的声明，就必须导致美国在台湾地区已经使用的武力的解除和由此而产生的紧张局势的和缓和消除，绝不能被用来使中国承认美国侵占台湾的现状。美国企图利用“两国不采用武力来解决争端”这个原则做幌子，实际上冻结台湾地区的现状，使中国承认它侵占台湾的合法化，并干涉中国在这个地区行使主权，这是中国人民在任何情况下都不能容许的。
    美方在中美会谈的会议上还提出美国要在中国领土台湾行使所谓“单独或集体的自卫权利”。台湾是中国的领土，根本谈不到美国在中国的领土上对中国实行什么“自卫”的问题，也根本不发生所谓防御的问题。由于美国在台湾已经对中国实行了武力侵占，如果谈到防御的话，那末，只有中国才有权防御，来驱逐这种武力侵占。
    美国政府还荒谬地妄图拿所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”作为美国在中国领土台湾实行“自卫”、“防御”的借口。谁都知道，美蒋“共同防御条约”本身就是美帝国主义对中国主权的侵犯和对中国内政的干涉，因而完全是非法的。只有中国才能在自己的领土台湾行使自卫权利。这是国际法的根本原则，绝不容许美国妄加歪曲；这也是中国人民的坚定立场，绝不丝毫动摇！
    在中美会谈过程中，我方提出了一系列的和平解决两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力的合理方案，建议举行中美外长会议和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势。我方在1955年10月27日的会议上提出的方案，建议中美两国在声明中具体提到通过和平谈判解决两国在台湾地区的争端而不诉诸武力，同时明确规定举行中美外长会议使这一声明得以实现。1955年12月1日，我方又提出另一方案，规定中美两国先发表一个和平解决两国争端而不诉诸武力的原则性的声明，然后由两国大使继续会谈，寻求实现这一共同愿望的具体途径。鉴于美国长期拖延会谈，我方于1956年5月11日又提出了新的方案，建议中美两国在声明中宣布和平解决两国在台湾地区的争端而不诉诸武力的同时，规定在声明发表后的一定期限内寻求并确定实现这一愿望的途径，包括中美外长会议在内。
    但是，美方却既反对确定举行中美外长会议来实现在台湾地区不使用武力的原则，又拒绝在一定期限内寻求和平解决中美两国争端的途径。它只是一味横蛮无理地坚持要求中国在台湾地区“放弃使用武力”和承认它在台湾的所谓“自卫”权利，以达到它侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政的目的。中美会谈就在美国的一手破坏下不能取得任何进展。
    尽管中国政府和中国人民不断揭露美国拖延和破坏中美会谈的阴谋，一再警告美国必须在台湾地区放弃使用武力和进行军事威胁的政策，但是，美国却继续加紧对中国领土台湾的侵略和控制，继续保持并加剧台湾地区的紧张局势。
    为了把台湾完全变成美国的殖民地和美国发动原子战争的基地，美国于1957年5月宣布在台湾驻扎装备导弹的美国空军部队，并把“斗牛士式”导弹部队开到台湾。1958年4月，美国国防部官员宣称美国正在“研究”关于在远东建立中程导弹基地的计划，台湾和南朝鲜“在首先考虑之列”。1958年5月美国在台湾秘密试验“斗牛士式”导弹的发射。美国在台湾建立导弹基地的侵略行为，不仅暴露它长期侵占台湾、恫吓中国人民的阴谋，并且证明它还正进一步要把台湾变为远东军事基地，加紧进行核备战，以蒋介石集团为工具，扩大对亚洲各国的侵略。这是对亚洲人民安全的威胁。
    三年来，美国一直在进行改编蒋军部队的工作，使蒋军完全成为美国的雇佣军。1955年12月，美蒋签订了一项蒋军“后备及补充制度的方案”，规定美国协助蒋介石集团建立九个预备师。1958年4月，美国国防部宣布“在数月内”按照目前美国的总的军事计划改编蒋军，“以便满足原子战争的需要”，并将在蒋军内组织五个“原子师”。
    为了把蒋军的一切行动完全置于美国人的直接控制之下，美国改组并加强了它驻在台湾的军事侵略机构。1958年5月，美国把它派驻在台湾的“美国军事援助顾问团”、“美国协防台湾司令部”等十七个不同从属的侵略机构合并成为“美军驻台协防军援司令部”，由道伊尔任总司令，为台湾地区美军和蒋军的最高指挥官。道伊尔在5月18日毫不掩饰地声称，司令部的任务是在“防卫台湾抵抗可能来自中国大陆共产党的攻击”，并且还说要阻挠我国解放沿海岛屿。
    美国以台湾为基地、以蒋介石集团为工具，在东南亚民族独立国家进行颠覆活动，粗暴地干涉这些国家的内政。它在印度尼西亚的侵略行为就是一个最新的例证。当印度尼西亚叛乱集团在美国的支持下进行武装叛乱时，美国通过台湾把各种轻重武器、军用作战飞机和飞机汽油运送给盘据在北苏拉威西的叛军；它指使蒋介石集团派遣军事和特务人员直接参加叛乱分子的军事行动；由蒋介石集团分子驾驶的美制飞机轰炸印度尼西亚领土的东部若干地区。美国对印度尼西亚内政的粗暴干涉，遭到全世界爱好和平、主张正义的人民的同声谴责。
    三年来，美国一直在筹划组织东北亚反共军事联盟，以图完成它包围中国和苏联的所谓“反共锁链的北部环节”。最近，日本政府在美国的授意下，正在加紧筹划由岸信介、蒋介石、李承晚、吴庭艳等美国傀儡集团组成的“东北亚反共联盟”，日本和南朝鲜双方正在就这问题进行谈判。亚洲爱好和平的国家和人民必须对这一政治和军事阴谋提高警惕。
    中国人民热爱和平，中国人民不要同美国打仗，中国政府愿意同美国政府坐下来谈判。但是，台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。台湾是一定要解放的。中国人民决不容许美国企图通过中美会谈来达到长期侵占台湾的目的，也决不容许美国长期拖延中美会谈来掩盖它霸占台湾的侵略行为。
