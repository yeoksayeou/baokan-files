    How to Spend This Year's Summer Vacation?
    The summer vacation for university, middle, and primary school students has begun this year. How to spend this year's summer vacation? This is a common concern for students and their parents. Currently, the Communist Youth League organizations and educational administrative departments in various regions are arranging students' summer vacation activities. This year, Xi'an and Chongqing will each mobilize 100,000 middle school and university students to go to the countryside, factories, and construction sites for production and labor training. Shaanxi Province has decided to mobilize 2.6 million young people to carry out a grass-cutting and fertilizer-collecting campaign. Communist Youth League organizations and educational administrative departments in Anhui, Liaoning, Gansu, and other regions have also issued notices to organize students to participate in labor. Going to the countryside and factories to participate in production, and supporting the technological and cultural revolutions in factories and rural areas has become the central content of summer vacation activities for middle school and above students this year.
    Combining education with labor is one of the basic principles of communist education, and also a powerful means of cultivating a new generation into cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. Our schools have been carrying out and are carrying out educational revolution, thoroughly eliminating the bad habits of education divorced from production and theory divorced from practice left over from bourgeois education, so that education and labor are combined. Utilizing the summer vacation to organize students to participate in industrial and agricultural production is also a concrete method of combining education and labor. Some people may ask: Schools have already implemented work-study programs, so why should students go to factories and rural areas during the summer vacation? It is true that schools implement work-study programs, and many schools have set up factories and farms, and students already have a certain amount of time to participate in productive labor. This is an important aspect of conducting labor education for students and realizing the combination of education and labor. However, this aspect alone is not enough. We should also adopt various methods to closely integrate school education with the vigorous practical life of national construction, so that students have more contact with workers and peasants, and promote the integration of educated youth with workers and peasants. Lenin said: "We do not believe in education, training and instruction being confined to the school walls and divorced from life." Now, the people of the whole country, especially workers and peasants, with soaring revolutionary zeal and a spirit of bold innovation, are constantly innovating and creating high production records, and the country's production and construction are advancing by leaps and bounds and changing with each passing day. In such a tide full of construction and labor, letting young students go to factories and rural areas to live and work with workers and peasants, and letting them personally observe and experience how workers and peasants are working selflessly, how they are arduously building our country and creating a better future life, this is a vivid course of socialist education, which will be of great benefit to strengthening students' political training, changing their non-proletarian thoughts and feelings, establishing a class viewpoint, a labor viewpoint, and a mass viewpoint, and overcoming individualism. At the same time, in joint labor with workers and peasants, they can also learn more complex and extensive production knowledge and production technology.
    Some people advocate: "After months of intense study, students should be allowed to cool off and rest during the holidays." This is an outdated view. Old education was separated from labor, mental labor and physical labor were opposed, and education always made people despise physical labor and physical laborers. In the old society, the children of the propertied class did not work, and they went sightseeing and vacationing during the holidays, enjoying themselves leisurely. This is a thing of the past. Our school education is to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. Since last year, educational administrative departments in various regions have successively changed the winter and summer vacation system of ordinary schools to agricultural busy season vacations. The purpose is to create conditions to facilitate students' participation in industrial and agricultural production and engage in various public welfare labor and housework. It should be known that after a period of busy study life, students participate in short-term physical labor, which is a good rest for the mind and a good exercise for the body. In the history of human social development, education was combined with labor at the beginning, and it was only in class societies that education and labor were separated. Now our country has basically completed the revolution of the ownership of the means of production, and has also achieved victories in the political and ideological fronts, which provides conditions for the combination of education and labor. We must use this condition to combine the two, so that intellectuals become laborers and the working people become intellectuals. Intellectuals participating in labor has become a system. This is a routine of socialist education, and we will do so today and will continue to do so in the future.
    The large number of students going to the countryside and factories during the summer vacation is a strong labor force and a cultural army. This is not only a powerful support for the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, but also a great support for technological innovation and cultural education in factories and rural areas. This labor force is educated to the middle and higher levels, and they have certain cultural knowledge. Therefore, in addition to humbly learning practical production knowledge from workers and peasants in labor and striving to engage in physical and political ideological training, the vast number of young students should also bring culture, science, and technology to the countryside and factories, help them eliminate illiteracy, help them run schools, help them carry out cultural and sports activities, and at the same time, apply the knowledge they have learned to practice and boldly reform and create tools.
    During the summer vacation, various regions should also appropriately arrange students' cultural and sports activities, such as camping, summer camps, travel, national defense sports, literary and artistic performances, etc. In addition, we should also pay attention to organizing students to review their lessons and organize them to read books and literary works with educational significance. In short, during the holidays, we should not only enable students to receive labor training, but also make their lives rich and colorful, and more interesting.
    Educated youths, participating in industrial and agricultural production labor during the summer vacation is a good opportunity for your ideological and physical training. The summer vacation is short, and we must not waste our precious time. Young students should actively go to labor and strive to gain double harvests in ideology and labor.

### 怎样度过今年的暑期？

    怎样度过今年的暑期？
    大、中、小学学生今年的暑期生活开始了，怎样渡过今年的暑期呢？这是学生们和学生的家长们普遍关心的问题。现在，各地共青团组织和教育行政机关正在安排学生的暑期生活。西安、重庆市今年将各动员十万名中等学校以上的学生下乡、下厂、下工地去生产，进行劳动锻炼；陕西省决定动员二百六十万少年开展一个割草积肥运动；安徽、辽宁、甘肃等地共青团组织和教育行政机关也先后发出了组织学生参加劳动的通知。到农村去，到工厂去参加生产，支援工厂、农村的技术革命和文化革命，已经成为今年暑期中等以上学校学生活动的中心内容了。
    教育和劳动结合是共产主义教育的基本原理之一，也是把新的一代培养成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的有力手段。我们的学校已经进行和正在进行教育革命，彻底地扫清资产阶级教育遗留下来的教育脱离生产和理论脱离实践的恶习，使教育和劳动结合起来。各地利用暑期组织学生参加工农业生产，也是教育和劳动结合的一个具体方法。有人可能会问：学校已经实行勤工俭学，为什么还要在暑期让学生到工厂、农村去呢？不错，学校实行勤工俭学，许多学校办起了工厂、农场，学生已有一定的时间参加生产劳动，这是对学生进行劳动教育，实现教育和劳动结合的一个重要方面。但是，仅仅有这一方面还不够，我们还应当采取多种方法，使学校教育和国家建设的蓬勃的实际生活密切结合，使学生和工人、农民有更多的接触，促进知识青年和工农的结合。列宁说过：“如果学习、教育和训练只局限于学校以内，而与蓬勃的实际生活脱离，这样的教育方式我们是不会相信的。”现在，全国人民特别是工人、农民以冲天的革命干劲和大胆独创的精神，革新创造和高额生产纪录层出不穷，国家生产建设一日千里，日新月异。在这样一个充满建设和劳动的浪潮里，让青年学生到工厂、农村去和工人、农民同生活、同劳动，让他们亲身观察和体验工人、农民怎样在忘我的劳动，怎样艰辛的建设我们的国家和创造未来美好的生活，这就是一堂生动的社会主义教育课程，对于加强学生的政治锻炼，改变他们非无产阶级的思想感情，树立阶级观点、劳动观点和群众观点，克服个人主义思想等，都会有很大好处。同时，在与工人、农民共同劳动中，还可以使他们学习到更复杂、更广泛的生产知识和生产技术。
    有人主张：“学生经过几个月紧张的学习，应当让他们在假期里消夏避暑，好好休息。”这是一种陈腐的观点。旧的教育是和劳动分离的，劳心和劳力是对立的，教育总是使人鄙视体力劳动、鄙视体力劳动者。在旧社会里，有产阶级的子弟是不劳动的，他们在假期里去游山玩水，消夏避暑，悠哉游哉。这是旧皇历了。我们的学校教育是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，从去年起，各地教育行政机关已先后将普通学校的寒暑假制度改放农忙假，其目的就是要创造条件，便于学生参加工农业生产和从事各种公益劳动、家务劳动。应该知道，学生在一个时期繁忙的学习生活后，参加短时间的体力劳动，互相调剂，对于脑力也是很好的休息，对身体也是很好的锻炼。在人类社会发展的历史上，开始的时候教育是和劳动结合的，只是在阶级的社会里才使教育和劳动分离了。现在我们的国家已经基本上完成生产资料所有制的革命，并且也取得了政治战线和思想战线上的革命的胜利，这为教育和劳动的结合提供了条件，我们必须利用这种条件，使两者结合起来，使知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化。知识分子参加劳动已成为制度。这就是社会主义教育的一种常规，今天这样做，将来也还要这样做。
    在暑期下乡、下厂的大批学生，是一支强大的劳动大军，也是一支文化大军，这不仅对于当前工农业生产大跃进是一个有力的支援，而且对于工厂、农村的技术革新和文化教育也是一个大的支援。这支劳动的队伍，都是受过中等、高等教育的，他们有一定的文化知识，因此，广大青年学生除了在劳动中虚心向工农学习实际生产知识，努力从事体力和政治思想的锻炼以外，还应当把文化、科学、技术带到农村、工厂去，帮助他们扫除文盲、帮助他们办学校，帮助他们开展文化体育活动，同时，要把所学得的知识应用到实践中去，大胆地改革和创造出工具。
    在暑期里，各地也要适当安排学生的文化体育活动，如野营、夏令营、旅行、国防体育、文艺演出等等。此外，还要注意组织学生复习功课，组织他们阅读富有教育意义的书籍和文艺读物。总之，在假期里，既要使学生受到劳动锻炼，也要使学生的生活过得丰富多彩，过得更有兴趣。
    知识青年们，在暑期参加工农业生产劳动，是你们思想和体力锻炼的很好的机会。暑期时间短暂，不可虚度大好光阴。青年学生要踊跃地到劳动中去，争取在思想上、劳动上得到双重的收获。
