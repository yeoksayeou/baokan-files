Xinhua News Agency, Changchun. Thanks to the great leap forward of the last two months, three scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun – the Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and the Institute of Applied Chemistry – have successfully researched and trial-produced 77 new products. Many of these projects have reached international standards.

The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics has successfully researched and trial-produced precision instruments such as a universal optical platform, a medium-sized spectrometer, a medium-sized large parallel light tube, and an extra-wide-angle multi-projection mapping instrument. These instruments incorporate many new innovations in design and manufacturing. For example, the universal optical platform was independently designed and trial-produced without any design drawings or data. The institute has also successfully researched 20 kinds of rare earth glass. These rare earth glasses are valuable materials used in cameras, telephoto lenses, and other advanced precision instruments. Their quality has reached international standards; four of them are currently unique in the world. The Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering has created a chromium-free high-speed steel that is unprecedented in the world, making a significant contribution to the precision tool manufacturing industry. The institute has also successfully trial-produced photoelastic plastic for use in machine parts strength testing, the first dynamic strain gauge, and bimetallic aluminum bearings with high wear resistance and strength, among other things. The Institute of Applied Chemistry has also created 18 new products. Researchers overcame many difficulties to produce butadiene-pyridine rubber, separated all 15 rare earth elements, including the three most difficult to separate: terbium, yttrium, and thulium. Recently, they have also successfully experimented with using wheat straw to make artificial fibers.

Young scientific workers have played a huge role in this great leap forward in scientific research, demonstrating unlimited potential. For example, young scientific workers at the Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, with revolutionary zeal, independently designed a high-end camera lens and a large-field movie camera lens in just 23 days. The imaging quality of these lenses exceeds the levels of West Germany and the United States, respectively, and the relative aperture of the lenses is larger than that of West Germany, and the field of view is larger than that of the United States. The manufacturing of lithium fluoride artificial crystals was previously considered difficult in American literature, and the crystallization time required 100 hours. The young scientific workers of this institute broke down superstitions and produced a large crystal with a diameter of 90 millimeters in only eight hours.

After the rectification campaign, the anti-rightist struggle, and the "double-anti" movement, scientific workers of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun, especially inspired by the general line of socialist construction, have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for work, broken down superstitions, shattered conservative ideas, and launched large-scale collaboration. Many of these scientific research achievements, such as the universal optical platform, medium-sized spectrometer, medium-sized large parallel light tube, butadiene-pyridine rubber, chromium-free high-speed steel, etc., are important projects that were successfully manufactured in a short period of time by scientific workers after the announcement of the general line.

    总路线照亮了科学工作者的心
    长春三个科学研究所制成七十多种新产品
    据新华社长春讯　中国科学院在长春的三所科学研究机关——光学精密机械仪器研究所、机械电机研究所、应用化学研究所，在最近两个多月的大跃进中，研究试制成功七十七种新产品。其中有很多项目已经达到国际水平。
    光学精密机械仪器研究所研究试制成功的万能光学台、中型光谱仪、中型大平行光管、特宽角多倍投影测图仪等精密的仪器，在设计、制造方面都有很多新的创造。例如万能光学台就是在没有任何设计图样、数据资料的情况下独立设计试制成功的。这个研究所还研究成功二十种稀土玻璃。这些稀土玻璃是照相机、望远镜头和其他高级精密仪器上用的贵重材料。它们的质量都达到国际水平；其中有四种目前在国际上还是空白。机械电机研究所创造了世界上还没有过的无铬高速钢，对精密工具的制造工业是一个很大的贡献。这个研究所还试制成功在进行机器零件强度试验时用的光弹性塑料，第一台动态应变仪，轧制成功耐磨性和强度高的双金属铝轴承等等。应用化学研究所也创造出十八种新产品。研究人员克服了很多困难制成了丁吡橡胶，分离了全部十五种稀土元素，包括最难分出的铽、钇、铥等三种稀土元素，最近他们还试验成功了用麦杆制人造纤维。
    青年科学工作者在这次科学研究的大跃进中发挥了巨大作用，显示出无限的潜力。例如光学精密机械仪器研究所的青年科学工作者鼓起革命干劲，只花了二十三天时间，就独立设计出一种高级照像镜头和大视场电影摄影机镜头。这些镜头的成像质量分别超过了西德和美国的水平，而且镜头的相对孔径比西德的大，视场比美国的大。氟化锂人工晶体的制造，过去在美国文献中认为是很难做的，而且结晶时间需一百小时，这个所的青年科学工作者破除迷信，只用了八小时就制成一个直径九十毫米的大晶体。
    中国科学院在长春的科学工作人员在整风、反右派和双反运动以后，特别在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，工作积极性空前高涨，破除了迷信，打破了保守思想，展开了大协作。这些科学研究成就中，有很多重要项目，如万能光学台、中型光谱仪、中型大平行光管、丁吡橡胶、无铬高速钢等等都是在总路线公布后，科学工作者们鼓足干劲，在短短的时间中突击制造成功的。
