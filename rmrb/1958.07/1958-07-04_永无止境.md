Never-Ending
Li Shao Cen

Recently, I have been reading in the newspapers about the per-mu yield of wheat experimental fields and the yarn count of fine yarn spun by various cotton mills in Wuhan, which are breaking records almost every day. This excites people and makes them think deeply: Has it reached its peak? Is it possible to achieve even higher records?

When the record of 3,215 jin per mu of wheat first appeared, some people were reluctant to believe it. But every day, opening the newspaper, one would find an even higher number. After the numbers 3,530 jin and 3,786 jin appeared, it then broke through the 4,000 jin mark, with successive numbers like 4,353, 4,535, and 4,689 jin. Now, it has already broken through the 5,000 jin mark. This is not all; Guan Musheng, a labor model from Pengxing Township, Xiaogan, even said that he would create a record of 10,000 jin per mu next year. There is nothing strange about this; since it is possible to produce 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu in the always barren mountainous areas and drylands, how can the traditionally fertile Jianghan Plain not produce 10,000 jin per mu? This means that even though the yield per mu of the experimental field exceeds the general yield by several times, it has not yet reached its peak.

When the cotton mills in Wuhan started spinning fine yarn, it was news to spin 60-count yarn. Subsequently, within thirteen days, it continuously increased from 80-count, 100-count, and 120-count to 140-count. Some people thought it had reached its peak. However, the next day it jumped from 140-count to 190-count, and the third day it jumped from 190-count to 230-count. Recently, it has reached 250-count, 280-count, and is even heading towards 300-count. The cotton mills in Wuhan lack the equipment to spin fine yarn, and some of the machines are even old. The cotton used in Wuhan is not good cotton. In the past, this was used as a reason for not being able to catch up with the cotton mills in Qingdao and Tianjin. Since it is possible to spin 280-count fine yarn with not-so-good cotton in the absence of machinery and equipment, who can guarantee that even finer yarn cannot be spun in better conditions?

Recently, there has been a new record for early rice: a record of 1,375 jin per mu appeared in Liming Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian, followed by a record of 2,340 jin per mu by Huashan Cooperative in Guixi County, Jiangxi, which far exceeded it. This is just the beginning!

Bourgeois scholars have prescribed certain production limits that are impossible to exceed. These limits have been or are being broken by us and left far behind. But breaking through the old quotas does not mean completely breaking through the old ideological restrictions. Just as admitting that the per-mu yield of wheat may increase to several thousand jin does not mean admitting that the increase in per-mu yield of wheat is endless. The old limitations have been broken; will the idea that development has reached its peak be generated, and will new limitations be used to restrict our development? This cannot but be a question.

Some people say that production development will always have an end. The field is only so big, and no matter how densely planted, it is ultimately limited. However, there are many factors that increase wheat production, and many have not yet been fully recognized by us. For example, chemical substances that can stimulate plant growth have now been discovered, which may cause plants to mature earlier and fruits to grow fatter. If such "fertilizers" can be used one day, wouldn't the yield be doubled again? Needless to say, there are other yield-increasing conditions that we don't know, which may greatly increase the unit yield of wheat. The increase in production will never reach its peak.

Wheat is like this, and so is other production. The premise of increasing production is to thoroughly liberate the mind, that is, to thoroughly smash all the limitations that believe that it can "stop here." The development of production is endless, and leap after leap is possible; nothing can stop us from moving forward.

    永无止境

    近来从报纸上看到，小麦试验田的亩产量和武汉各纱厂试纺细纱的支数，几乎每天都是在刷新纪录；这使人兴奋又引人深思：是不是已经到了顶呢？是不是可能还出现更高的纪录呢？
    在小麦刚出现亩产3215斤的纪录时，还有人不肯相信；但每天翻开报纸，却会发现一个比一个更高的数字。在出现3530斤和3786斤的数字之后，接着便突破四千斤的大关，连续出现4353、4535、4689斤等数字，而现在是已经又突破五千斤的大关了。这还不算，孝感朋兴乡的劳动模范官木生，竟说要在明年创造亩产万斤的纪录。没有什么值得奇怪的；既然在一向贫瘠的山区和旱地都有可能亩产四、五千斤，在一向是比较肥沃的江汉平原又怎么能不出现亩产万斤呢？这就是说，尽管试验田的亩产量比一般产量超出好几倍，都还并没有到顶。
    武汉各纱厂开始纺细纱，纺出了六十支的细纱都要算新闻，随后在十三天内连续由八十支、一百支，一百二十支增加到一百四十支，就有人以为已是到了顶了；但接着到第二天便由一百四十支跳到一百九十支，第三天又由一百九十支跳到二百三十支；最近又二百五十支、二百八十支，以至径向三百支前进了。武汉各纱厂都缺乏纺出细纱的设备，有些连机器都是陈旧的；武汉地方所用的棉花不是好棉花，往日还是拿这当作赶不上青岛、天津等地的纱厂的理由的；既然在缺乏机器设备的情况下用不够好的棉花都能纺出二百八十支的细纱，又谁能担保在更好的情形下不能纺出更细的纱呢。
    最近又出现了早稻的纪录：开始在福建海澄县黎明社出现亩产1375斤的纪录，接着江西贵溪县花山社便又以亩产2340斤的记录远远地超过了它；这还只是个开始哩！
    资产阶级学者曾给某些生产规定出不可能再高的极限，这些极限已经或正在给我们打破，并把它远远地丢在后面了。但突破了旧的定额并不等于完全突破了旧的思想上的限制；正如承认小麦的亩产量可能提高到几千斤，也并不等于承认小麦亩产量的增加是无有止境的一样。旧的局限是打破了；是不是会产生发展已是到顶的思想，又用新的局限来限制我们的发展呢？不能不是一个问题。
    有人说，生产发展总会有个止境的，田亩总只有那样大，再密植些也终归是有限的。但是，小麦增加的因素多得很，甚至有许多现在还没有被我们充分认识。例如现在就已发现出可以刺激植物生长的化学物质，它可能使植物成熟的更早、果实长的更肥大；假如将来有朝一日能用上这样的“肥料”，产量不是又会成倍地增加么？不用说，还有一些我们不知道的增产条件，可能使小麦更大大地提高单位产量，增产是永远也不会到顶的。
    小麦是如此，其他生产何尝不是如此？增产的前提，是思想要彻底解放，也就是要彻底粉碎一切这样认为可以“到此为止”的限制。生产的发展是无有止境的，跃进再跃进是可能的；没有什么能阻挡我们前进。
