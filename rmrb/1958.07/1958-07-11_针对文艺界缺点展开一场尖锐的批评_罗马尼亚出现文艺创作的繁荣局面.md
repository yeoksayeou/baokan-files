Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 9th: In the past month, Romanian newspapers and periodicals have conducted an in-depth criticism of bourgeois ideology and revisionist thought in Romanian literary and art circles. Currently, a healthy new situation of flourishing creation is emerging in Romania's literary and art circles.

In terms of literary creation, many writers are preparing to create works reflecting socialist construction. "Literary Gazette" is continuously publishing the long novel "The Roots are Bitter," which depicts the lives of peasants before and after liberation. The film industry is adapting the novel "Thirst," which depicts peasant life, into a film. The Bucharest Theater Annual Conference sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party stating that they would guarantee to perform plays with communist educational significance for the working people in the future.

For many years, in Romania, many writers have adhered to the path of socialist realism in their creations. They depicted contemporary reality and praised the heroic anti-fascist struggles of communists and working people, as well as the socialist construction after liberation. However, there are still relatively serious shortcomings in literary and art circles, such as valuing the ancient over the modern, neglecting politics, tolerating the free proliferation of revisionist views and erroneous thoughts, and being unwilling to write about modern life and preferring to write historical novels.

Romanian newspapers launched a sharp criticism of the shortcomings in literary and art circles. Many newspapers pointed out that there were too few works reflecting the working class, working farmers, and intellectuals connected to the people, reflecting the Party's underground struggles, the revolutionary traditions of the people, and the changes in people's ideological consciousness during the great social reforms. Newspapers criticized some writers for not seeing the real conflicts of our time and focusing on the mundane trivialities of leisurely, tranquil, and ancient rural life. For example, one writer had not written a single work with the reality of socialist Romania as its subject matter in fourteen years. Newspapers said that the same shortcoming of neglecting modern subjects also existed in film and poetry creation. Newspapers also pointed out that there was a lack of due criticism in the study of literary heritage. Newspapers also criticized some unhealthy phenomena in musical creation and performance, and the worship of decadent Western bourgeois music. The newspapers also criticized the lack of attention to political content and the one-sided emphasis on writing techniques when the theatrical circles staged some Western works.

While criticizing these shortcomings in literary and art circles, Romanian newspapers also focused on analyzing the reasons for these shortcomings. The newspapers pointed out that the revisionist thought existing in literary and art circles was one of the reasons for these shortcomings. "Spark" criticized the erroneous view that artistic creation is purely "free." When talking about the reasons why some writers like to create with historical themes, "Spark" said that this was not because they had a special study of history, nor was it because they were unfamiliar with the surrounding environment, but because writing history might be subject to less supervision. The newspapers also emphasized the importance of adhering to the path of socialist realism in creation.

The criticism of bourgeois ideology in literary and art circles began after the symposium of cultural and propaganda cadres convened by the Cultural and Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party at the end of May this year. The meeting proposed that political and ideological work in philosophy, history, literary theory, film, drama, and literary publishing should be improved in the future. At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held in June, it was emphasized that the work on the ideological front should be strengthened and revisionism and other harmful thoughts should be resolutely opposed. This criticism of the influence of bourgeois ideology in literary and art circles by Romanian newspapers is part of the Party's efforts to strengthen the entire ideological work.

### 针对文艺界缺点展开一场尖锐的批评  罗马尼亚出现文艺创作的繁荣局面

    针对文艺界缺点展开一场尖锐的批评
    罗马尼亚出现文艺创作的繁荣局面
    新华社布加勒斯特9日电　最近一个月来，罗马尼亚报刊对罗马尼亚文艺界的资产阶级思想和修正主义思想进行了一次深入的批评。目前，罗马尼亚文艺界正在出现一个健康的创作繁荣的新局面。
    在文学创作方面，不少的作家正在准备创作反映社会主义建设的作品。“文学报”正在连续刊载描写解放前后农民生活的长篇小说“根是苦的”。电影界正在把描写农民生活的小说“渴望”改编成电影。布加勒斯特戏剧界年会给罗马尼亚工人党中央的电报说，今后保证演出对劳动人民有共产主义教育意义的剧目。
    许多年来，在罗马尼亚，有不少作家一直坚持了社会主义现实主义的创作道路，他们描写了当代的现实社会，歌颂了共产党员和劳动群众英勇的反法西斯斗争以及解放后的社会主义建设事业。但是，在文艺界还存在比较严重的厚古薄今、忽视政治、容忍修正主义观点和错误思想自由泛滥以及不愿写以现代生活为题材而爱写历史性的小说等缺点。
    罗马尼亚报纸针对文艺界存在的缺点展开了一场尖锐的批评。许多报纸指出，反映工人阶级、劳动农民以及和人民有联系的知识分子的作品，反映党的地下斗争，人民的革命传统以及在伟大的社会改革中人们思想意识变化的作品都太少了。报纸批评一些作家看不见我们时代的真实冲突，专心于描写那些闲幽、宁静、古老的乡村等生活中平淡的琐事。如有个作家十四年来未写过一篇以社会主义罗马尼亚现实生活为题材的作品。报纸说，在电影和诗歌的创作中也有同样存在忽视现代题材的缺点。报纸并指出，在研究文学遗产时，也缺少应有的批判。报纸也批评了音乐创作和演出中的一些不健康现象，和对西方资产阶级颓废音乐的崇拜。报纸对戏剧界上演一些西方作品时，对政治内容注意不够，片面强调写作技术的缺点也进行了批评。
    罗马尼亚的报纸在对文艺界的缺点提出这些批评时，也着重分析了产生这些缺点的原因。报纸指出，在文艺界存在的修正主义思想是产生这些缺点的一个原因。“火花报”批判了那种认为艺术创作是纯“自由”的错误观点。在谈到有些作家喜欢以历史为题材进行创作的原因时，“火花报”说，这并不是因为他们对历史有特别的研究，也不是他们对周围的环境不熟悉，而是因为写历史可能受到的监督较少。报纸也都强调指出了坚持社会主义现实主义创作道路的重要。
    对文艺界资产阶级思想的批判，是从今年5月底罗马尼亚工人党中央文化宣传部召开的文化宣传干部座谈会以后开始的，这次会议曾经提出，今后要改善哲学、历史、文学理论、电影、戏剧、文艺出版等方面的政治思想工作。6月间举行的罗马尼亚工人党中央全会上，又强调地指出要加强思想战线的工作，坚决反对修正主义和其他有害的思想。这一次罗马尼亚报纸批判文艺界的资产阶级思想影响，是党加强整个思想工作的一个部分。
