	If You Can Repair, You Can Manufacture

	The fact that railway vehicle depots in various regions are manufacturing new vehicles, breaking the decades-old convention that vehicle depots can only perform general repairs, is indeed good news.

	Repairing and manufacturing are indeed different, but they are also interconnected. Whether it's a machine or a vehicle, if it needs to be repaired, it must go through the process of disassembly and assembly, and it inevitably requires processing some parts to replace them. Since you can disassemble, assemble, and process parts, of course you can also manufacture. The question is whether you want to take this step: from repair to manufacturing.

    能修理就能制造
    各地铁路车辆段制造新车，打破了几十年来车辆段只能做一般修理工作的陈规，确是一份捷报。
    修理和制造确实不同，但却又相通。机器也好，车辆也好，既要修理，就要经过拆卸的过程，装配的过程，也少不了要加工一些零件补上去。既然能拆、能装、能加工零件，当然也就能制造。问题在于你想不想跨这一步：从修理到制造。
