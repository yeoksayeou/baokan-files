    The Gun of the Peace Warrior
    Jordan Nuzha Salamu
    Shoot! Let the gun of the peace warrior fire fiercely!
    Don't fear, don't panic, aim the gun at the chest of the tyrant, the chest of the greedy.
    Shoot! In Jerusalem, in Amman, in the fierce battles everywhere.
    Shoot! On quiet roads, in high mountains and deep valleys.
    Shoot! Shoot! The gun of the peace warrior.
    Ah, glorious people, heroic and unyielding warriors, hold up your chests; with your firm faith, eliminate the tyrannical rulers and create peace.
    However, a small group of evil enemies, a batch of Chicago gangsters—robbers and plunderers of our cotton, oil, and minerals, want to tame you and hurt you with violence.
    Hey! Tyrannical rulers, the dark fortress has been shattered yesterday, the people's front has been formed, and the will to fight has been ignited in our hearts.
    Brave warriors, advance! Hold your guns tightly and advance bravely, as long as we take up arms, we will win.
    Blood-sucking enemies, wait, you wait!
    The gun of the peace warrior is about to fire!! About to fire!!! Like a whirlwind in the desert, sweeping away all the filthy dregs!

    和平战士的枪
    约旦　努兹哈·萨拉姆射击吧！和平战士的枪猛烈地射击吧！别畏惧，别惊慌，把枪口对准暴虐者的胸膛，贪婪者的胸膛。射击吧！在耶路撒冷，在阿曼，在一切地方的剧烈战斗中。射击吧！在幽静的马路上，在高山和深渊中。射击吧！射击吧！和平战士的枪。啊，光荣的人们，英勇不屈的战士们，挺起你们的胸膛；凭借你们坚定的信仰，消灭暴虐的统治者，创造和平。然而一小撮罪恶的敌人一批来自芝加哥的歹徒——抢劫和掠夺我们的棉花、石油和矿
  藏的强盗，想用暴力来驯服你、伤害你。嘿！暴虐的统治者，黑暗的堡垒已在昨天粉碎，人民的战线已经形成，我们心中已经掀起了战斗的意志。英勇的战士们前进吧！握紧你们的枪杆勇猛前进，只要拿起武器，我们就会胜利。吸血的敌人，等着吧，你们等着吧！和平战士的枪，就要发射！！就要发射！！！像沙漠里的旋风，卷走一切污秽的渣滓！
