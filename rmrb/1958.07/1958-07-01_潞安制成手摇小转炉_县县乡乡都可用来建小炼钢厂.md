Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch: The Guxian Iron Plant in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, recently successfully smelted its first batch of steel using a self-created 50-kilogram hand-cranked small converter. After testing and identification, the quality of the steel fully meets the standards for medium carbon steel.

The emergence of this simple-to-operate small converter will enable all counties, townships, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives in the province that have small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces for iron smelting to set up small steel plants.

The 50-kilogram small converter created by the Guxian Iron Plant is different from ordinary small converters. The rotation of the furnace body does not require mechanical power; it is done by hand cranking. The molten iron supplied to the small converter does not require a cupola furnace, only a general pig iron melting furnace used for sand casting, and the iron outlet of the melting furnace is aligned with the small converter so that the molten iron can automatically flow into the converter. After the steel is smelted, it does not need to go through a steel ladle. The ingot mold is pushed under the small converter with a small cart, and it can be directly cast.

A set of this steelmaking equipment costs only more than 7,000 yuan, and the cost of the steel produced is also very low.

This converter was successfully researched and tested by Tian Xinhua, the head of the technical department of the Guxian Iron Plant, and the workers.

### 潞安制成手摇小转炉  县县乡乡都可用来建小炼钢厂

    潞安制成手摇小转炉
    县县乡乡都可用来建小炼钢厂
    据新华社太原电　山西省潞安县故县铁厂最近用自己首创的一种五十公斤手摇小小转炉，试炼成功了第一炉钢。经过化验鉴定，钢的质量完全合乎中炭钢的标准。
    这种技术简单极易操作的小小转炉的出现，将使全省县、乡、农业社和手工业社设有炼铁小高炉和土高炉的地方，都可办起小炼钢厂。
    故县铁厂创造的这种五十公斤的小转炉，和一般小转炉不同。炉身的转动不需要机械动力，用手来摇就行。供应小转炉的铁水，不用冲天炉，只用一个一般翻沙用的化铁炉，而且化铁炉出铁口对准小转炉，使铁水可以自动流入转炉。钢炼成后，也不用经过钢包，把铸锭模用小车推到小转炉下，就可以直接浇铸。
    这种炼钢设备一套只需七千多元，而且炼出的钢成本也很低。
    这种转炉是故县铁厂技术科长田新华和工人们研究试验成功的。
