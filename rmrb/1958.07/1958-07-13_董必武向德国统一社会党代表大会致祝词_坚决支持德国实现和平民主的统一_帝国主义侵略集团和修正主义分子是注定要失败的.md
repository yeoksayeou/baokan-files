Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 12th. The Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party continued its session at 9:00 this morning. After the Executive Chairman of the Congress, Honecker, announced the opening of the meeting, he first invited Dong Biwu, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, to speak. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly to express their welcome.

Dong Biwu first extended warm, fraternal congratulations to the Congress, all members of the German Socialist Unity Party, and the people of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all members of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people.

During his address and the reading of the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee, warm applause erupted continuously. When he mentioned "We are now in an era where the East wind prevails over the West wind," the whole audience became lively, and prolonged warm applause broke out, with cheers from some. When he talked about "Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will definitely catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of important industrial products within fifteen years or less," and "Imperialist aggression groups and revisionist elements who serve the policies of imperialism are destined to fail," he once again won prolonged applause from the whole audience.

After Dong Biwu finished his speech, the whole audience stood up and gave him prolonged warm applause. Ulbricht, Grotewohl, and Matern shook hands with Dong Biwu cordially one by one. At this moment, the whole audience shouted: "Long live the great and glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!"

The general debate then continued.

The full text of Dong Biwu's congratulatory speech is as follows:

Dear Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all members of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese people, I extend warm, fraternal congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party and, through the Congress, to all members of the German Socialist Unity Party and the people of the German Democratic Republic.

The German Democratic Republic is the first country in German history led by the working class where the working people are masters of their own affairs, and it is the only truly peace-loving country that represents the national interests of all the German people. Now, under the leadership of the German Socialist Unity Party, which is rich in revolutionary tradition, the German Democratic Republic is victoriously carrying out socialist construction along the path indicated by the great sons of the German people and founders of scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, and along the path of the October Revolution, and has already achieved brilliant successes. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are immensely pleased with the achievements made by the German Socialist Unity Party and the people of the German Democratic Republic in building socialism.

The German Socialist Unity Party leads the people of the German Democratic Republic in resolutely opposing the revival of West German militarism, opposing the equipping of West German troops with nuclear weapons, and opposing Adenauer's return to the old path of wars of aggression. The German Socialist Unity Party, proceeding from the interests of the working class and the entire nation, has proposed the reunification of its own German homeland on a peaceful and democratic basis through the formation of a confederation, and has waged unremitting struggles to realize this glorious task. This struggle has always been resolutely supported by peace-loving countries around the world and the Chinese people. We firmly believe that although there are still many difficulties facing the German people, a unified Germany belonging to the people is an inevitable trend of historical development and will certainly be realized.

The government of the German Democratic Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy in international affairs, and is waging arduous struggles to ease international tensions and safeguard the cause of peace in Europe and the world. The German Socialist Unity Party has consistently been loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism and has made significant contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

The German Socialist Unity Party, leading the people of the German Democratic Republic, has completed the first five-year plan for developing the national economy and is now forging ahead to realize the second five-year plan. The German Socialist Unity Party's proposals to improve the style of work of the Party, improve the work of state organs, emphasize that "socialist construction is first and foremost the education of people," emphasize the application of dialectical materialism in practical work, and the correct measures taken to consolidate the Party's unity will greatly promote the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic.

Socialist China and Germany are fraternal countries born in the same year and month. The friendly and cooperative relations between the people of the two countries in various fields have already developed satisfactorily. We firmly believe that with the development of the socialist construction of our two countries and the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Germany will be further comprehensively developed and consolidated.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved decisive victory in socialist revolution on economic, political, and thought fronts through the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce in 1955-1956, and the rectification campaign and anti-rightist struggle since 1957. In May of this year, the Chinese Communist Party convened the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, which set the general line for our people to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The legacy that the People's Republic of China received from old China was economic and cultural backwardness, both poverty and blankness. This especially requires us to carry out socialist construction more, faster, better, and more economically, and strive to develop our country's productive forces at the highest speed, and build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture in as short a time as possible. The Chinese Communist Party firmly believes that the liberated, awakened, united, and organized 600 million people are the greatest creative force in China. As long as we continue to apply and develop the mass line in our construction work, that is, trust the masses, rely on the masses, educate the masses, and point out to the people the bright future and the favorable conditions that can overcome all difficulties, thus arousing the enthusiasm of the 600 million people and mobilizing the 600 million people to strive for the highest speed of development, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and realize the glorious tasks put forward by the Party.

Now, our Party's general line for socialist construction has been grasped by the labor army of 600 million Chinese people and has become an extremely great material force. After overfulfilling the first five-year plan last year, our country's socialist construction is advancing in an all-round way. The total industrial output value from January to May of this year has already completed 47% of the original annual plan, an increase of about 30% compared with the same period last year. In agriculture, from October of last year to May of this year, the national irrigated area has been expanded by 26.6 million hectares, which is 1.06 million hectares more than the irrigated area achieved in the past thousands of years before liberation. This year's summer grain harvest increased by about 17.5 million tons compared with last year's summer grain harvest. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will surely be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of important industrial products within fifteen years or less.

Dear Comrades, we are now in an era where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in November of last year and the two declarations it issued have brought the unity of the international communist movement into a new stage. The recent meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states held in Moscow are another major contribution to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and to the cause of world peace. Now, the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is confidently striding forward to promote a new upsurge in economic and cultural development. In contrast, the imperialist camp is falling apart due to its internal contradictions. The economic crisis of the capitalist world, which began in the United States, has intensified the contradictions between imperialist countries, intensified the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist movements, and sharpened the class contradictions within imperialist countries, promoting the working class and working people to strengthen the struggle against the monopoly bourgeoisie. All attempts by bourgeois representatives and modern revisionists to defend imperialism, especially American imperialism, are nothing but futile efforts.

Recently, the Yugoslav leadership group launched an attack on the Soviet Union and the international communist movement through their thoroughly revisionist program, which has been met with a stern rebuff from Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. Yugoslav revisionism, as we have repeatedly pointed out, is the product of modern international class struggle and the product of the policies of modern imperialists, especially the most ferocious enemy of the world's people, American imperialists. The Yugoslav revisionists, at a time when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the imperialist countries are in deep crisis, and all the inherent contradictions of the capitalist world are sharpening, come out to attack the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, attack the Communist Parties of various countries, and defend American imperialism, which is hostile to the socialist camp and hostile to peace, which is exactly what the American imperialists need. Not long ago, the Hungarian government made a completely just judgment on Nagy and his accomplices. But the imperialists were furious and tried to use this to carry out new anti-communist agitation; and the Yugoslav leadership group was also angered by this and echoed the imperialists, opposing the just actions of the Hungarian government. This fact more fully confirms that in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident, the Yugoslav leadership group played a veritable ugly role as an interventionist and instigator. In order to consolidate the unity of the international communist movement and defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, international communists must carry this struggle against modern revisionism to the end. Bad things can be turned into good things. Through this struggle, the international communist movement will be further consolidated and developed, and the cause of world peace and democracy will also be victoriously developed. Imperialist aggression groups and revisionist elements who serve the policies of imperialism are destined to fail.

Finally, let us heartily congratulate the successful conclusion of this congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Congratulations to this congress for making new contributions to promoting the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany, to enhancing the socialist construction of the German Democratic Republic, and to safeguarding world peace and the unity of the international proletariat.

Dear Comrades, I now read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to your congress:

Congratulatory Telegram from the CPC Central Committee

To the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Part:

The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese people, extends warm, fraternal congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party.

Under the leadership of the glorious German Socialist Unity Party, the German people have made tremendous achievements in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, building the foundation of socialism, developing industrial and agricultural production, and improving the people's lives over the past eight years. These achievements have greatly encouraged the Chinese people.

The heroic German Socialist Unity Party stands on the western frontier of the socialist camp, in opposing world imperialist forces, especially the West German monopoly capital groups and militarist forces, striving for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and safeguarding the cause of peace in Europe and the world, has been waging arduous struggles. This struggle has always been resolutely supported by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. The German Socialist Unity Party and its Central Committee, which are rich in revolutionary tradition, have waged a resolute struggle against the revisionist ideology that opposes Marxism-Leninism in order to maintain the organizational and ideological unity of its ranks on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles and to defend the unity within the international communist movement.

The Chinese Communist Party firmly believes that the convening of the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party will make new contributions to leading the German people in building socialism, further promoting the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, to opposing the imperialist policy of aggressive war, striving for world peace and promoting human progress; to crushing modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav leadership group, and consolidating the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement.

We heartily and warmly congratulate the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party.

        Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    董必武向德国统一社会党代表大会致祝词
    坚决支持德国实现和平民主的统一
    帝国主义侵略集团和修正主义分子是注定要失败的
    新华社柏林12日电　德国统一社会党第五次代表大会今天上午九点钟继续开会。大会执行主席昂纳克宣布开会后，首先请中国共产党代表团团长、中共中央政治局委员董必武讲话。这时全场起立，热烈地鼓掌表示欢迎。
    董必武首先代表中国共产党中央委员会、中国共产党全体党员和中国人民向大会和德国统一社会党全体党员以及民主德国全国人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    在他致词和宣读中共中央贺电的过程中，不断地暴发出热烈的掌声。当他谈到“我们现在正处在一个东风压倒西风的时代”时，全场活跃，响起了长时间的热烈鼓掌，并且有人发出欢呼声。当他谈到
  “中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，一定能够在十五年或更短时间内在重要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国”，以及“帝国主义侵略集团和为帝国主义政策效劳的修正主义分子是注定要失败的”时，又一次博得了全场长时间的掌声。
    董必武致词完毕后，全场起立，报以长时间的热烈鼓掌。乌布利希、格罗提渥和马特恩一一和董必武亲切握手。这时全场高呼：“以毛泽东同志为首的伟大的光荣的中国共产党万岁！”
    随后进行的大会发言仍在继续中。
    董必武的祝词全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们：
    我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会、中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，并通过大会向德国统一社会党全体党员和德意志民主共和国人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个由工人阶级领导的劳动人民当家作主的国家，是唯一真正代表德意志全体人民民族利益的、爱好和平的国家。现在，德意志民主共和国在富有革命传统的德国统一社会党的领导下，沿着德国人民的伟大儿子、科学的社会主义创始人马克思和恩格斯所指示的方向，沿着十月革命的道路，正在胜利地进行着社会主义建设，并且已经获得了光辉的成就。中国共产党和中国人民对于德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国人民在建设社会主义事业中所获得的成就，感到无限的高兴。
    德国统一社会党领导德意志民主共和国人民，坚决反对西德军国主义的复活，反对西德军队装备核武器，反对阿登纳重走侵略战争的老路；德国统一社会党从工人阶级和全民族利益出发，提出通过成立邦联的形式，在和平、民主的基础上重新统一自己的德意志祖国，并且为了实现这个光荣的任务，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。这个斗争一直受到全世界爱好和平的国家和中国人民的坚决支持。我们深信，尽管在德国人民面前还有许多困难，但是一个属于人民的统一的德国，是历史发展的必然趋向，是一定能够实现的。
    德意志民主共和国政府在国际事务中，一贯奉行和平的对外政策，为缓和国际紧张局势，维护欧洲和世界的和平事业进行着艰巨的斗争。德国统一社会党一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义原则，在加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性方面，作出了重大的贡献。
    德国统一社会党领导德意志民主共和国的人民，已经完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，现在正在奋勇直前，为实现第二个五年计划而奋斗。德国统一社会党所提出的改进党的工作作风，改善国家机关工作，强调“社会主义建设首先是对人的教育”，强调在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，并且为党的巩固团结而采取的正确的措施，都将大大地推进德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业。
    社会主义的中德两国是同年同月诞生的兄弟国家。两国人民在各方面的友好合作关系已经有了令人满意的发展。我们深信，随着我们两国社会主义建设事业的发展，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的巩固，中德两国人民的友谊和合作，必将获得进一步的全面的发展和巩固。
    中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，通过1955—1956年的对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造和1957年以来的整风运动和反右派斗争，已经取得了经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利。今年5月，中国共产党召开第了八届全国代表大会第二次会议，为我国人民确定了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。
    中华人民共和国从旧中国所得到的遗产是经济和文化的落后，是既穷又白。这就特别要求我们又多又快又好又省地进行社会主义建设，力争用最高的速度发展我国的生产力，在尽可能短的时间内，把我们国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。中国共产党深信，解放了的、觉悟了的、团结起来和组织起来的六亿人民，就是中国最伟大的创造力量。只要我们在建设事业中继续应用和发展群众路线，也就是信任群众、依靠群众、教育群众、向人民群众指出光明的前途和能够克服一切困难的有利条件，这样鼓足了六亿人民的干劲，动员了六亿人民来力争最高的发展速度，我们就能够战胜一切困难，实现党所提出的光荣任务。
    现在，我们党的社会主义建设的总路线，已经被六亿中国人民组成的劳动大军所掌握，变成了极其伟大的物质力量。在去年超额完成了第一个五年计划以后，我国的社会主义建设事业正在全面跃进。今年1月至5月的工业总产值，已经完成了国家原订年度计划的47％，约比去年同期增长30％。在农业方面，从去年10月到今年5月份为止，全国扩大灌溉面积二千六百六十万公顷，比解放前几千年间所达到的灌溉面积还多一百零六万公顷。今年夏收粮食产量比去年夏收粮食增加了一千七百五十万吨左右。中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，一定能够在十五年或更短时间内，在重要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。
    亲爱的同志们，我们现在正处在一个东风压倒西风的时代。去年11月各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其所发表的两个宣言，使国际共产主义运动的团结进入了一个新阶段。最近在莫斯科召开的经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议和华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议，对于加强社会主义阵营的团结，对于世界和平的事业又是一个重大贡献。现在，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营正满怀信心地为促进新的经济文化的高涨而大步迈进。与此相反，帝国主义阵营却因为它们内部矛盾重重而陷于分崩离析。由美国开始的资本主义世界经济危机，使帝国主义国家间的矛盾日益加剧，使反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的运动更加高涨，并使帝国主义国家内的阶级矛盾日益尖锐，促进了工人阶级和劳动人民加强反对垄断资产阶级的斗争。一切资产阶级代表和现代修正主义者为帝国主义特别是为美帝国主义辩护的企图，都不过是枉费心机。
    最近，南共领导集团通过他们的彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领而向苏联和国际共产主义运动发动的进攻，已经遭到各国共产党和工人党的严正的回击。南斯拉夫修正主义，如同我们一再所指出的那样，是现代国际阶级斗争的产物，是现代帝国主义者、特别是世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义者的政策的产物。南斯拉夫修正主义者在东风压倒西风，帝国主义国家危机重重、资本主义世界一切固有矛盾尖锐化的时候，出来攻击苏联和社会主义阵营，攻击各国共产党，为仇视社会主义阵营和仇视和平的美帝国主义辩护，这恰恰适合于美帝国主义者的需要。不久之前，匈牙利政府对纳吉及其同伙作出了完全正义的判决。但是帝国主义却狂怒起来，企图借此进行新的反共煽动；而南共领导集团也因此而恼羞成怒，同帝国主义者相呼应，反对匈牙利政府的正义行动。这个事实，更加充分地证实了南共领导集团在匈牙利反革命事件中，货真价实地担当了干涉者和挑拨者的丑恶角色。为了巩固国际共产主义运动的团结，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，国际共产主义者必须把这个反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。坏事可以变成好事，经过这一斗争，国际共产主义运动将会进一步巩固和发展，世界和平、民主事业也将得到胜利的发展。帝国主义侵略集团和为帝国主义政策效劳的修正主义分子，是注定要失败的。
    最后，让我们衷心地祝贺高举着马克思列宁主义旗帜的德国统一社会党的这次代表大会圆满成功。祝贺这次代表大会，对于促进德国的和平民主的统一，对于增强德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设事业，以及保卫世界和平，保卫国际无产阶级的团结事业，作出新的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们，我现在宣读中国共产党中央委员会给你们代表大会的贺电：
    中共中央的贺电
    德国统一社会党第五次代表大会：
    中国共产党中央委员会代表中国共产党和中国人民，向德国统一社会党第五次代表大会，致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    德国人民在光荣的德国统一社会党的领导下，八年多来在巩固人民民主专政政权、建设社会主义基础、发展工农业生产和改善人民生活等方面，获得了巨大的成就，这些成就大大地鼓舞了中国人民。
    英勇的德国统一社会党站在社会主义阵营的西方前哨，在反对世界帝国主义势力，特别是反对西德垄断资本集团和军国主义势力，争取德国在和平、民主基础上的重新统一，维护欧洲和世界和平的事业中，一直进行着艰巨的斗争。这一斗争，一贯受到中国共产党和中国人民的坚决支持。富有革命传统的德国统一社会党及其中央委员会为维护自己队伍在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的组织上和思想上的团结，为保卫国际共产主义运动内部的团结，同反对马克思列宁主义的修正主义思想进行了坚决的斗争。
    中国共产党深信，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的召开，对于领导德国人民建设社会主义，进一步促进德国在和平民主基础上的统一，对于反对帝国主义的侵略战争政策，争取世界和平和促进人类进步；对于粉碎以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，必将作出新的贡献。
    我们衷心地热烈地祝贺德国统一社会党第五次代表大会的圆满成功。
        中国共产党中央委员会
