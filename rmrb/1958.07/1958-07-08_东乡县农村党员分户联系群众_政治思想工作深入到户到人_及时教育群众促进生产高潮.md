    Dongxiang County Rural Party Members Contact Households and Masses
    Political and Ideological Work Deeply Penetrates Households and Individuals, Timely Education of the Masses Promotes a Production Upsurge
    (Our newspaper's Nanchang electric dispatch) Reporter Yue Gexin reports: Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, has universally adopted the method of rural Party members contacting households and masses, bringing political and ideological work deeply into households and to individuals. The Organization Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this is an advanced system for strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses and enlivening branch work, and it is also a good way to consolidate the results of the rectification campaign.
    After the all-people rectification campaign in Dongxiang County, the political consciousness of the broad masses has greatly increased, and production enthusiasm has soared. Under these circumstances, some rural Party members began to develop some illusions. They believed that after the rectification campaign, all problems had been resolved, and there was no need to carry out any more political and ideological work. Therefore, when they discovered ideological problems among the masses, they did not help to solve them. Party members who were agricultural cooperative and team cadres also mostly focused their work on the team and group levels and could not go deep into households and to individuals. Once the Party's ideological work was relaxed, some right-leaning conservative ideas among the masses began to grow again, to the point that they affected the continued development of the great leap forward in production.
    After learning of this situation, the Dongxiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that it was necessary to give full play to the active role of all rural Party members, strengthen the Party's regular leadership over non-Party masses, and do a good job in regular political and ideological work to ensure that the production upsurge would be sustained and to complete this year's great leap forward plan for agricultural production throughout the county. How should the Party organization do a good job in regular political and ideological work? How to strengthen the Party's leadership over non-Party masses and maintain and promote the masses' high revolutionary enthusiasm? In the work practice of Changlin Township in the county, the Dongxiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found that organizing rural Party members to contact households of the masses was a good way to solve these problems. Therefore, they promoted this system among more than two thousand Party members in more than two hundred rural branches throughout the county.
    When Dongxiang County universally promoted this method, it conducted a major debate among rural Party members. As a result of the debate, it was unanimously believed that Party members contacting households of the masses had "three abilities" and "three advantages." That is: it can do a good job in ideological and political work and mobilize the masses well; it can regularly contact the masses, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is good; and it can regularly receive the supervision and help of the masses, which is good for training and improving Party members. The objects of Party members' contact are based on a combination of voluntary and assigned. In order to facilitate activities, the contact is generally nearby (in the village or group). The number of households contacted by each Party member is generally five to six, up to a dozen or more, and as few as three, depending on the specific circumstances of the Party member. The general task of Party members contacting households is to do a good job in political and ideological work, understand the ideological trends of the masses, publicize and explain the Party's policies and guidelines to the masses, and influence the masses with their own exemplary actions. In each period, specific tasks are proposed according to production and central work. In this way, Party members can have clear and specific goals to strive for, and they can also use concrete facts to check and measure political and ideological work. Party members' contact activities mainly use collective production and after-dinner chat opportunities to conduct heart-to-heart talks in the fields, family visits, and pre- and post-meeting conversations, bringing political and ideological work to the fields and to the doorsteps, so as to say heartfelt words at any time and place and solve problems in a timely manner. In order to check and supervise Party members' household contact work, the Party organization has also established an inspection and evaluation system and regularly conducts specific leadership work.
    After Dongxiang County universally implemented the system of rural Party members contacting households of the masses, some right-leaning conservative ideas among the masses were overcome in a timely manner through the patient and specific education of Party members, which further increased the enthusiasm for production and thus promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production. Some previously backward masses leaped to become advanced elements. Party members themselves have also been tempered and made new progress in the activities of contacting the masses. Party members who used to bury their heads in production without caring about work have become active, and Party members with shortcomings in their work style have further corrected their shortcomings. Therefore, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer, and the masses regard Party members as confidants and consult with them when they have problems.

    东乡县农村党员分户联系群众
    政治思想工作深入到户到人  及时教育群众促进生产高潮
    本报南昌电  记者岳革新报道：江西省东乡县普遍采取农村党员分户联系群众的办法，将政治思想工作深入到户和人。中共江西省委组织部认为，这是密切党与群众联系和活跃支部工作的一个先进制度，同时也是巩固整风成果的好办法。
    东乡县经过全民整风，广大群众政治觉悟大大提高，生产热情空前高涨。在这种情况下，部分农村党员开始产生了一些错觉，他们认为：经过整风什么问题都解决了，用不着再进行什么政治思想工作。因此，发现群众的思想问题也不去帮助解决；担任农业社、队干部的党员，工作也多停留在队、组，不能深入到户到人。党的思想工作一放松，群众中的某些右倾保守思想又开始滋长起来，以至影响到生产大跃进运动的继续开展。
    中共东乡县委了解到这种情况，认为必须充分发扬全体农村党员的积极作用，加强党对非党群众的经常领导，做好经常的政治思想工作，才能使生产高潮持久，才能完成今年全县的农业生产大跃进计划。党组织如何做好经常的政治思想工作？如何加强党对非党群众的领导，保持与发扬群众高度的革命积极性呢？中共东乡县委在该县长林乡的工作实践中，发现组织农村党员分户联系群众，是解决这些问题的一个好办法。于是便在全县二百多个农村支部二千多名党员中推行了这项制度。
    东乡县普遍推行这个办法时，在农村党员中进行了一次大辩论。辩论结果，一致认为党员分户联系群众有“三能”、“三好”。即：能做好思想政治工作，发动群众好；能经常联系群众，党群关系好；能经常受到群众的监督和帮助，锻炼提高党员好。党员联系的对象是根据自愿和分配相结合。为了便于活动，一般是就近联系（本村、本组）。每个党员联系的户数一般是五至六户，多的十几户，少的三户，看党员的具体情况而定。党员分户联系的任务，总的是做好政治思想工作，了解群众的思想动态，向群众宣传解释党的方针政策，并以自己的模范行动去影响群众。在每一时期，又根据生产和中心工作，提出具体任务。这样，既可以使党员有明确具体的奋斗目标，又可以通过具体的事实去检查衡量政治思想工作。党员的联系活动主要是利用集体生产和茶余饭后聊天机会，进行田间谈心、家庭访问、会前会后交谈，把政治思想工作带到田间，送上家门，做到随时随地说知心话，发现问题及时解决。党组织为了检查督促党员的分户联系工作，还建立了检查评比制度，并经常进行具体领导工作。
    东乡县普遍推行农村党员分户联系群众的制度后，群众中出现的一些右倾保守思想，在党员耐心具体的教育下，及时得到了克服，进一步提高了生产积极性，因而促进了农业生产大跃进。一些过去落后的群众一跃而为先进分子。党员本身在联系群众的活动中，也得到了锻炼，有了新的进步，过去埋头生产不管工作的党员活跃起来了，工作作风有缺点的党员，进一步改掉了缺点。因此，党群关系更加密切，群众都把党员当作知心人，有事就找党员商量。
