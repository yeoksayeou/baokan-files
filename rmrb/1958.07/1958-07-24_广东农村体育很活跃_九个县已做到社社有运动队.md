    新华社广州23日电　广东省部分农村体育运动很活跃。据十八个县6月份的统计，农村运动队已发展到一万二千八百四十二队，有九个县已经做到社社有运动队。现在，全省除了台山、中山等原来农村体育活动基础较好的县份以外，普宁、广宁也赶上来了。
    普宁县已经做到社社有体育协会组织，平均每个农业社有十五个运动队，开展了多种体育活动。这个县参加体育活动的人数已占全县总人数三分之一。他们还准备在夏收以后，在全县农业社推行广播操，争取全县有一半人口参加体育锻炼。山区广宁县参加体育锻炼的人数已占总人口的18％，建立了将近六百个运动队，开展了多种多样经常性的活动。台山县新围农业社一个社就有男、女、青、少年排球、篮球、田径、游泳、乒乓、象棋、武术、划船等运动队八十四个，运动员有五百零七人，经常进行各种体育活动。中山县沙边乡泗门村农业社和台山县新围社等好几个社都推行了“劳卫制”。中山县张家边乡、东莞县道沥乡等还办了农民业余体育学校。许多农业社每天傍晚，到处开展文娱体育活动，体育竞赛已成为农村庆祝节日的重要内容之一。
    各地农村就地取材因陋就简地兴建了许多体育场所，仅据七个县的统计，就有篮、排球场或运动场三千三百九十九个。农业社社员们用义务劳动开山平土，或者把晒谷场装上球架等设备，建成球场；利用池塘、水库、山塘、河渠等修游泳池；利用乡村公路修跑道。运动器具也都利用农村现成材料制作，为开展体育运动创造了良好条件。
