Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 19th: TASS, Stockholm, July 19th: Swedish Foreign Minister Undén made a statement on Swedish Radio regarding Sweden's attitude in the UN Security Council. He believes that the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon is not acting in accordance with the UN Charter; the United Nations should not interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs.

　　From the point of view of international law, such support for the insurgent side is illegal. If the scale of this support is very large, then it can be said that the war has changed its nature, from a civil war to an international war.

　　Undén said that, therefore, Sweden has suggested that intelligence regarding the secret transport of weapons across the Lebanese border be inspected. In order to achieve this goal, impartial observers were sent to Lebanon. This was possible because it was not opposed by the Lebanese side, nor by the United Arab Republic. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld also went to Lebanon, after which he held talks with President Nasser in Cairo.

　　The Swedish representative to the Security Council did not make any criticism of the US actions from a legal point of view, but he opposed the argument that the war in Lebanon was an international war.

　　Two conclusions can be drawn from Sweden's attitude: Firstly, US intervention is a political action, and the US is doing so according to its own intentions, and not according to the obligations it has undertaken in accordance with the (UN) Charter. Secondly, the United Nations should not intervene, because the issue concerns the internal affairs of a UN member state.

　　Undén finally said: As long as there is a practical possibility of reversing the military situation, the United Nations should help. Therefore, our attitude is temporary. We believe it is important that the United Nations and the UN Secretary-General continue their efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the current complex situation.

    瑞典外长发表声明
    黎巴嫩内政不容许外人来干涉
    美国的行动不符合联合国宪章
    据新华社20日讯  塔斯社斯德哥尔摩19日讯：瑞典外交大臣恩顿就瑞典在联合国安全理事会中的态度在瑞典电台发表了声明。他认为，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩不是根据联合国宪章行事；联合国不应干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    从国际法的观点来看，对起义方面作这种支援是不合法的。如果这种支援的规模很大，那么，就可以说，战争改变了性质，从内战变为国际战争了。
    恩顿说，因此，瑞典建议，对秘密运送武器越过黎巴嫩边境的情报予以检查。为了达到这个目的，派遣了公正的观察员到黎巴嫩去。这件事之所以可能，是因为没有遭到黎巴嫩方面的反对，也没有遭到阿拉伯联合共和国方面的反对，到黎巴嫩去的还有联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，此后他又在开罗同纳赛尔总统举行了会谈。
    瑞典驻安理会代表没有根据法律观点对美国的行动提出任何批评，但是他反对这样一种议论，即所谓黎巴嫩的战争是国际性战争。
    根据瑞典的态度可以得出两个结论：一、美国干涉是政治行动，美国这样做是根据自己的意图，而不是根据依照（联合国）宪章所承担的义务。二、联合国不应插手，因为问题是有关联合国成员国的内政。
    恩顿最后又说：只要有挽回军事局面的实际可能，联合国就应该予以帮助。因此我们的态度是临时性的。我们认为，联合国和联合国秘书长继续努力以寻求和平解决当前复杂局势的办法是很重要的。
