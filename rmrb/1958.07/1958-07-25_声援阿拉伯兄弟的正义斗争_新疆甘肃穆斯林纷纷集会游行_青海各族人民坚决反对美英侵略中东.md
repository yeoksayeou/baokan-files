The imams who spoke at the meeting all used the Korean War, the Suez Canal incident, and the current situation in the Middle East to explain that US-British imperialism is the deadly enemy of peace. They expressed their indignation and determination to unite firmly with peace-loving people all over the world and fight the imperialist aggressors to the end.

On the same day, more than 50 religious leaders and imams in Lanzhou also spontaneously gathered to protest the heinous act of US-British imperialism in armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 24th—People of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau strongly protested against the armed aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism. In the eleven counties (cities) in the agricultural area alone, 70,000 to 80,000 people have held rallies and marches in recent days to demonstrate against US-British imperialism.

More than 600 lamas from the Ta'er Monastery who participated in the demonstration excitedly raised their arms and shouted in Tibetan, "American troops get out of Lebanon!"

Oil workers in the Qaidam Basin and miners in Datong Coal Mine, the largest coal mine in Qinghai Province, are closely watching the current situation. They expressed their determination to produce more oil and coal to enhance the strength of the motherland.

　　At the protest meeting in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, demobilized soldiers Zhao Jingwen and Kong Chengdong spoke on behalf of the demobilized soldiers, saying that the soldiers who had fought against US-British imperialism in Korea could use their own experience to prove that US-British imperialism is a thorough paper tiger. They pointed out that if US-British imperialism expands its war provocations, a more tragic end than the war of aggression against Korea is waiting for them.

　　Currently, the protest movement is developing in depth. (Attached pictures)
