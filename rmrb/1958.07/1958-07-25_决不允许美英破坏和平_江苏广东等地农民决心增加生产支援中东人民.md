Following the mass rally of ten thousand people in Yancheng on the 20th, over four million farmers in the entire Yancheng Special District have successively held rallies to protest the crimes of US and British imperialism in invading the Middle East. After holding a rally to protest, members of the Huancheng Agricultural Cooperative decided to engage in indigenous steelmaking on a large scale and strive for high-yield rice production to strengthen the forces defending world peace with practical actions. Cooperative member Xu Hengyue said, "We are all of one mind to guarantee the realization of 10,000 catties [per mu], making the American imperialists tremble and quickly get out of Lebanon."

More than 10,000 township, cooperative, and team cadres in Qingpu County, who are holding a pledge rally to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Arab countries. Chen Zhilin, a cadre of the Zhuyang Agricultural Cooperative, said: We have suffered at the hands of the Japanese devils in the past. Now, putting ourselves in their shoes, we must resolutely support the just struggle of the Arab people. Now, many townships and cooperatives in this county have set rice production increase targets and are actively carrying out field management, pest and disease control, and fertilizer accumulation activities. The farmers said: The faster we build socialism, the better we can stop the aggression of US and British imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th. In recent days, many small towns, villages, and agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have held large-scale demonstrations and parades, resolutely opposing the armed aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism.
