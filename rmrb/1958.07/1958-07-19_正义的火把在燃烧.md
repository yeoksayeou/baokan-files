    The Torch of Justice is Burning
    Liu Baiyu
    As we are striving for peaceful construction, American and British imperialism have extended their sinister hands to our Arab brothers, igniting the flames of a war of aggression.
    In these past few days and nights, six hundred million Chinese people have deeply loved and cared for their Arab brothers. At this moment, we cannot but be delighted by this clear fact: In Beirut, a Lebanese child in an orange shirt, standing far away and watching the American bandits step onto the sacred soil of Arabia, vowed in Arabic:
    "We are Arabs, we will definitely drive them back!"
    The harsh experiences of life have taught us Chinese people what fire is, what blood is, what shameless aggression is, and what a heroic response is.
    Now, let us especially cheer for this Lebanese boy in the orange shirt! Because his brave words, spoken fearlessly in the face of the invaders, are not just a boy's oath, but symbolize the entire Arab nation standing up after breaking the chains of colonialism.
    The times have changed now, it is the era of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. For a long time in the past, the imperialists used to call the places they invaded "the dark East." Is that really the case? No, everyone knows how our long and wise culture shone brilliantly like the sun, illuminating the eyes of people all over the world. It was the imperialist pirates who pointed their cannons at our chests and wrapped snake-like chains around us. However, the days when the imperialists could do whatever they wanted are long gone, like the last ray of the setting sun. Our Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and a paper tiger can be poked through with a finger. This was proven in the Korean War a few years ago. It was further proven in the battle over the Suez Canal the year before last. Heroic nations are not only unafraid of war, but always stand up and move forward in war. Forward! Arab people, it is time to smash the chains of colonialism!
    We Chinese people advocate lasting world peace, but we must also take responsibility for the future destiny of mankind. To the people of Iraq and Lebanon who are fighting for justice, we will guarantee our most sincere friendship, a friendship that is the purest gold, shining not only in the peaceful sunlight, but also shining in the dust of struggle. Since imperialism has stretched out its hand, we have only one result before us: to break it! The torch of justice is in our hands, let the oath of the boy in the orange shirt in Beirut burn as brightly as the torch of justice! (Attached picture)

    正义的火把在燃烧
    刘白羽
    在我们正在努力于和平建设时，美英帝国主义向阿拉伯兄弟伸出了罪恶的黑手，点燃起侵略的战争火焰。
    在这几个日夜里，六亿中国人民都在深切地热爱着、关怀着阿拉伯兄弟。这时，我们不能不为这一件鲜明的事实而高兴，在贝鲁特，有一个穿着橘黄色衬衫的十多岁的黎巴嫩小孩站在远远的地方看美国匪徒踏上阿拉伯神圣国土时，他用阿拉伯语发誓说：
    “我们是阿拉伯人，我们一定把他们打回去！”
    我们中国人民的生活经历严峻地教导了我们，我们知道什么是火，什么是血，什么是无耻的侵略，什么是英雄的答案。
    现在，让我们特别向这个穿着橘黄色衬衫的黎巴嫩少年欢呼吧！因为，他，无畏地面对着侵略者说出的勇敢的语言，不只是一个少年的誓词，而他象征着整个的阿拉伯民族在击断殖民主义锁链而站立起来。
    现在时代已经变了，已经是东风压倒西风的时代了。在以往那样长的一段时间内，帝国主义者曾经把他们侵略的地方说成为“黑暗的东方”。难道事情真是这样吗？不，谁都知道，我们那悠久的充满智慧的文化，是怎样像太阳一样灿烂闪光，照亮了全世界人的眼睛。是帝国主义海盗们把炮口对准我们胸膛，把毒蛇般的锁链缠在我们身上。但是，现在，帝国主义想怎么样就怎么样的日子，早已像最后一线夕阳一去不返了。我们的毛主席早已指出美帝国主义是个纸老虎，纸老虎是可以用手把它戳破的。这一点，在几年前的朝鲜的战争中得到证明。在前年的苏伊士运河上的战斗中更得到了证明，英雄的民族不但不怕战争，而且总是在战争中站立起来前进的。前进吧！阿拉伯人民到了把殖民主义的锁链纷纷砸碎的时候了。
    我们中国人民是主张世界的持久和平的，但我们也要为人类未来的命运而负起责任。对于为正义而斗争的伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民，我们将以最亲切的友谊作为保证，这种友谊是最纯真的金子，它不但在和平的阳光下是灿烂的，它在斗争的尘烟中也将一样是灿烂的。帝国主义手既然伸出来了，我们面前就只有一个结果，那就是打断它！正义的火把是掌握在我们手里的，让贝鲁特那个穿橘黄色衬衫少年的誓言，像正义的火把一样熊熊燃烧起来吧！（附图片）
