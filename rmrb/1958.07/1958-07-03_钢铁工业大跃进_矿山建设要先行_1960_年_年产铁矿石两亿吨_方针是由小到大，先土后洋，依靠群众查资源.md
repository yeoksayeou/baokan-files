Xinhua News Agency, Handan, July 2nd: Great Leap Forward in steel production, mine construction should come first. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a national conference in Handan from June 20th to 27th to promote the construction of ferrous metal mines. The conference pointed out that after the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel smelting, iron ore production should catch up at the fastest speed and stay ahead of steel smelting construction.

According to reports, some provinces have not given enough importance to the construction of ferrous metal mines; although some provinces have initially formulated mine construction plans based on their own steel development plans and iron ore resource conditions, the progress of mine construction is very slow because some people have the idea of wanting to build large mines but not wanting to mine small ones, and believing in mining mechanization but not wanting to use indigenous methods. The representatives attending the meeting criticized this kind of thinking that is divorced from reality and these mysterious concepts. They learned on the spot from the experience of the Tieshan Iron Mine in Kuangshancun, Hebei Province, which broke the old mine construction procedures, designing, building, and producing simultaneously, first using indigenous methods for mining, and gradually developing from small to large. It went into production in five months, which gave them great inspiration and encouragement.

At the meeting, the representatives unanimously proposed to work hard for three years and strive to increase iron ore production twelve times compared to last year, so that the national annual iron ore production will reach more than 200 million tons by 1960. In order to achieve this leap forward target, the meeting required the metallurgical industry departments of all provinces to, under the leadership of the provincial party committees, quickly conduct overall planning and arrangements for mine construction based on the province's steel development plan and immediately start construction; and conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small mines to accelerate the speed of mine construction. At present, the focus should be on medium and small mines, so that the ore needed by existing blast furnaces can be continuously supplied. The mining experience of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, in mobilizing the masses to go to the mountains to mine, working hard during slack farming seasons, working a little during busy farming seasons, and not working during extremely busy farming seasons, is worth vigorously promoting. For the construction of mines that are larger iron and steel plant ore supply bases, it is necessary to break the old construction procedures of first designing, then constructing, and then putting into production only after all construction is completed, and adopt the method of designing, constructing, and producing simultaneously, gradually developing from small to large, so as to speed up mine construction.

In the discussion, the representatives of all provinces also unanimously agreed that in the current situation of shortage of steel materials and mining machinery, the principle of first indigenous and then foreign should be adopted in mining methods. At present, indigenous methods and tools for mining should be mainly promoted. At the same time, like the Dashishan and Yanqianshan Iron Mines in Liaoning Province, it is also necessary to mobilize employees to boldly create machinery to improve mining efficiency. Mines with suitable conditions should try to mine open-pit mines before underground mines in the mining process. This will enable the mining of a large amount of ore in a short period of time.

Clarifying iron ore resources is also an important part of accelerating mine construction. The meeting summarized the experience of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, and Xing'an County, Guangxi Province, in relying on the masses to clarify iron ore resources and find a large number of mineable iron ore deposits. The common characteristics of these two counties are: the county party secretary personally takes the lead, leading the masses to the mountains to find mines; not relying on professional geological exploration teams, but organizing mass mineral survey teams by the county and township, surveying, finding, and learning at the same time; and extensively mobilizing the masses to combine prospecting, exploration, and mining. In this way, without national investment, mine resources were clarified in a short period of time, and a large amount of ore was mined, which is worth promoting in various places. (Picture attached)

The large iron ore mine on the border of Xinyu, Fenyi, Ji'an, Xiajiang, Anfu and other five counties in central Jiangxi is 40 kilometers long and covers an area of ​​400 square kilometers. The reserves are more than 7 billion tons, which is the largest iron ore found in China. At present, exploration work is being actively carried out. This is the drilling tower standing in the jungle.

2.  The miners designed and built three automatic inclined plate tracks, which solved the problem of slope transportation. They used the method of heavy vehicles carrying light vehicles, and can transport a trip of ore in forty seconds.

3.  In order to transport the ore as soon as possible, the workers are working hard to load the car. Two people can load more than seven tons of ore into the car in one hour. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Panqi

### 钢铁工业大跃进　矿山建设要先行  1960年——年产铁矿石两亿吨  方针是由小到大，先土后洋，依靠群众查资源

    钢铁工业大跃进　矿山建设要先行
    1960年——年产铁矿石两亿吨
    方针是由小到大，先土后洋，依靠群众查资源
    新华社邯郸2日电　钢铁生产大跃进，矿山建设当先行。冶金工业部于6月20日到27日在邯郸召开全国黑色金属矿山建设促进会议，指出炼铁炼钢工业大跃进以后，铁矿石生产应该以最快的速度迎头赶上去，走在钢铁冶炼建设的前面。
    根据汇报，目前有些省份对黑色金属矿山建设还未予以足够的重视；有些省份虽然根据本省钢铁发展规划和铁矿资源条件，初步制订出矿山建设计划，但由于有些人存有愿建设大矿山、不愿开采小矿，迷信采矿机械化、不愿用土办法的思想，矿山建设进度很慢。参加会议的代表批判了这种脱离现实的思想和神秘观念。他们实地学习了河北省矿山村铁矿打破旧的建矿程序，边设计、边建设、边生产，先用土法开采，由小到大逐渐发展，五个月时间就投入了生产的经验，得到了很大的启示和鼓舞。
    在会上，代表们一致提出苦干三年，力争铁矿石产量比去年增长十二倍，到1960年使全国铁矿石年产量达到两亿吨以上。为了实现这个跃进指标，会议要求各省冶金工业部门，在省委领导下，根据本省钢铁发展规划，迅速对矿山建设进行全盘规划安排，立即上马；并且认真执行大中小同时并举的方针，以加快矿山建设的速度，目前则应该以中、小型为主，使现有高炉所需要的矿石能够得到源源不断的供应。河南登封县发动群众上山采矿，农闲大干、农忙小干、大忙不干的采矿经验，值得大力推广。对较大的钢铁厂矿石供应基地的矿山建设，要打破旧有的先设计、再施工、全部建成后才投入生产的建设程序，采用边设计、边建设、边生产的办法，由小到大逐步地发展，使矿山建设速度加快。
    在讨论中，各省代表还一致认为，在目前钢铁器材和矿山机械缺乏的情况下，在采矿方法上要采取先土后洋的方针，目前应该主要推行土办法、土工具采矿，同时也要像辽宁省大石山和眼前山铁矿那样，发动职工群众大胆创造机械，以提高采矿效率。有条件的矿山，在开采程序上要尽量先采露天后采坑下。这样便能在短期内开采出大量的矿石来。
    查清铁矿资源，也是加速矿山建设的一个重要环节。会议总结了河南登封县和广西兴安县依靠群众查清铁矿资源，找出大量可采铁矿的经验。这两个县的共同特点是：县委书记亲自挂帅，带领群众上山找矿；不依靠专业地质勘探队，由县、乡组织群众性的矿藏普查队，边查、边找、边学；普遍发动群众，把找矿、探矿与采矿结合起来。这样，不用国家投资就在短期内查清了矿山资源，并且开采出大量矿石，很值得在各地推广。（附图片）
    江西中部新余、分宜、吉安、峡江、安福等五县边境的大铁矿，长四十公里，面积四百平方公里，储量在七十亿吨以上，是我国目前发现的最大的铁矿。现在，勘探工作正在积极进行。这是矗立在丛林中的钻塔。　　　　　　　新华社记者　漆荒诗摄

    2　矿工们自己设计建设了三条自动卷斜板道，解决了坡道运输问题。他们采用重车带轻车的办法，四十秒钟可运送一趟矿石。
    3　工人们为了早日运出矿石，正在努力装车。两个人一小时可以把七吨多矿石装到车上。　　　　　　新华社记者　时盘棋摄
