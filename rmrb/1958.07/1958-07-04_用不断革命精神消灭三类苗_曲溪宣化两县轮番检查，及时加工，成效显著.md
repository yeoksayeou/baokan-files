Eliminate Third-Class Seedlings with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
Rotation Inspections and Timely Processing in Quxi and Xuanhua Counties Yield Significant Results

According to a report in the Yunnan Daily: The Quxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province organized all farmers in the county to conduct rotation-based general surveys and evaluations of all fields, and to process and remedy them in a timely manner, with significant results.

The planting of early rice, cotton, and sugarcane in Quxi County ended in early May. Based on the demands of the vast majority of the masses, the Quxi County Committee decided to organize the masses to evaluate and rank seedlings, to eliminate third-class seedlings in a concentrated effort, to improve second-class seedlings, and to develop first-class seedlings. Then conduct inspections and evaluations again, and eliminate third-class seedlings on the new basis. The Quxi County Committee demanded that such rotation inspections be used to seize every detail of increased production, so that seedlings grow according to the highest requirements for increased production.

Their method was to organize experienced veteran farmers and commune cadres to conduct a general survey of each plot of land; according to the quality of seedling growth, all fields were marked with red, green, and white flags respectively. In the first survey, a total of 3,053 mu of third-class seedling fields were marked with white flags throughout the county. The inspection team, in accordance with the agricultural commune's stipulated measures for increasing production, studied the reasons why the third-class seedlings in each plot were not growing well, and wrote the remedial measures that should be taken immediately on the white flags. Within five days of the first survey, all agricultural communes in the county, in accordance with the remedial measures specified on the white flags, made a concentrated effort to eliminate the third-class seedlings.

In late May, the county conducted a second field survey, eliminating 2,907 mu of third-class seedlings in the new situation. Recently, the county conducted a third survey, identifying 4,165 mu of seedlings that were not growing well under relatively comparable conditions, and more than 5,000 people have been engaged in topdressing and weeding activities.

During the survey, the agricultural communes simultaneously proposed not to relax on second-class seedlings, to enable them to catch up with first-class seedlings, and for first-class seedlings to become even better and always remain good, always deserving a red flag.

After such continuous rotation surveys and processing, the early rice throughout the county is now more than three feet tall, with generally more than 20 tillers per plant, and is universally budding and heading. Local people reflect that these are good crops like never before in history, truly reflecting a great leap forward. The County Committee has proposed to work with one breath until the autumn harvest, continuously conducting surveys and processing, and strive to create miracles of large-scale high yields.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 3rd. Party organizations at all levels in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, in leading field management work, launched a "Red All Over" movement among the masses, so that the growth quality of crops in various townships and communes went from imbalance to balance, and from balance to imbalance, continuously advancing on a new basis.

This year, Xuanhua County's 1.05 million mu of food crops were sown early, with sufficient fertilizer, careful cultivation, and excellent growth. Township and commune cadres and the broad masses of commune members believed that achieving the leap forward plan and obtaining 315 million catties of grain for the county was not a problem, and therefore there was a relatively widespread sense of complacency to varying degrees, and laxity in field management work. After discovering this problem, the County Committee decided to launch a "Red All Over" movement throughout the county. The method was: to take the commune as a unit, conduct a major inspection and ranking of crops in the fields, and insert small red, yellow, and blue flags into the ground to indicate good, medium, and bad. Mobilize commune members to eliminate third-class seedlings, promote second-class seedlings, and consolidate and improve first-class seedlings. Inspection teams formed by the production teams were required to conduct inspections at any time, requiring that they universally reach the red flag standard. After about ten days, conduct another inspection, re-rank, and re-flag on the new basis. Repeat this until the autumn harvest to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's leap forward plan. After each ranking, mobilize commune members to launch debates. The main content of the debate was to examine whether the spirit of the general line had inspired every commune member's enthusiasm, whether they were striving for advancement, content with the middle, or willing to lag behind. At the same time, concrete measures and labor arrangements for removing blue flags were also discussed.

After the first major inspection and ranking, 350,000 mu of second-class and third-class crops were upgraded after topdressing, watering, cultivating, and replanting. On June 22, the County Committee formed nine inspection teams and went deep into various townships and communes to conduct in-depth inspections, re-rank, and flag, identifying 500,000 mu of second-class and third-class seedlings on the new basis. The "Red All Over" movement became even more magnificent, with 61,000 full and semi-laborers involved in the movement, an increase of about 20% compared with the previous stage. The work progress also accelerated significantly, with more than 400,000 mu of seedlings hoed (second time) in eight days, with a daily progress rate 58% faster than before; more than 130,000 mu were topdressed, with a daily progress rate 80% faster than before.

### 用不断革命精神消灭三类苗  曲溪宣化两县轮番检查，及时加工，成效显著

    用不断革命精神消灭三类苗
    曲溪宣化两县轮番检查，及时加工，成效显著
    据云南日报报道：中共云南省曲溪县委组织全县农民，对全部田地进行轮番普查评比、及时加工弥补，成效很显著。
    曲溪县的早稻、棉花和甘蔗在5月初栽种结束。曲溪县委根据绝大多数群众的要求，决定组织群众进行苗棵评比排队，突击消灭三类苗，提高二类苗，发展一类苗，再检查，再评比，消灭在新的基础上的三类苗。曲溪县委要求通过这样的轮番检查，抓紧每一个增产细节不放，让苗棵按照增产的最高要求来生长。
    他们的办法是组织富有生产经验的老农和社干部对各丘田地普查；根据苗棵成长的好坏，全部田地分别插上红、绿、白旗。在第一次普查中，全县被插上白旗的三类苗田地共有三千零五十三亩。检查组对照着农业社规定的增产措施，研究各该丘三类苗成长不好的原因，把应该立即采取的弥补措施写在白旗上。在第一次普查后的五天内，全县各农业社都按照白旗上指定的弥补措施，突击消灭三类苗。
    5月下旬，全县又进行第二次田间普查，消灭新情况下的三类苗二千九百零七亩。最近，全县又进行了第三次普查，查出在相对比较情况下长得不够好的禾苗四千一百六十五亩，已有五千多人在进行追肥、薅锄活动。
    在进行普查中，各农业社同时提出不放松二类苗，让二类苗赶上一类苗，一类苗要好上加好，永远好下去，次次插红旗。
    经过这样不断地轮番普查加工，全县早稻已有三尺多高，分蘖一般都在二十多苗，正普遍打苞抽穗。当地群众反映，这是历史上从来没有过的好庄稼，真是个大跃进的样子。县委提出要一股气干到秋收，不断地进行普查加工，力争创造大面积丰产的奇迹。
    据新华社天津3日电　河北宣化县各级党组织在领导田间管理工作中，发动群众开展“满堂红”运动，使各乡、社的庄稼生长成色由不平衡到平衡，又由平衡到不平衡，不断在新的基础上向前猛进。
    今年宣化县的一百零五万亩粮食作物，播种早，肥料足，耕作细致，生长得很出色。乡、社干部和广大社员认为实现跃进计划，全县拿到三亿一千五百万斤粮食没问题，因此比较普遍地存在不同程度的自满情绪，对田间管理工作表现松懈。县委发现这个问题后，确定在全县开展一个“满堂红”运动。办法是：以社为单位，在田间对庄稼进行大检查、大排队，以红、黄、蓝三色小旗插在地里，表明好、中、坏。发动社员消灭三类苗，促进二类苗，巩固提高一类苗，由队组成检查组随时检查，要求普遍达到红旗标准。经过十天左右，在新的基础上再检查，再排队，再插旗。如此反复，直到秋收，保证完成和超额完成今年的跃进计划。每次排队后，发动社员展开辩论。辩论的主要内容是以总路线的精神检查每个社员的干劲鼓足了没有，是力争上游，安居中游，还是甘居下游。同时也讨论出拔蓝旗的具体措施和劳力安排等。
    第一次大检查、大排队以后，三十五万亩二类、三类庄稼经过追肥、浇水、中耕、补种，大部分已经升级。6月22日，县委又组成九个检查组，到各乡、社深入检查，重新排队，插旗，在新的基础上确定了二类、三类苗五十万亩。“满堂红”运动更加壮阔，投入运动的整半劳动力达六万一千多人，比前一阶段增加20％左右。工作进度也显著加快，八天中锄苗（第二遍）四十多万亩，每天进度比前加快58％；追肥十三万多亩，每天进度比前加快80％。
