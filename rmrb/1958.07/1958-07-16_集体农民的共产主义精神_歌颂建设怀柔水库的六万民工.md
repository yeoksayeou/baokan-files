    Communist Spirit of Collective Farmers
    —Praising the 60,000 Laborers Building the Huairou Reservoir
    The towering dam stands majestically between the mountains, and the man-made lake embraced by the green hills of the Huairou Reservoir is now rippling with blue waves.
    "Sixty thousand heroes with courageous hearts, build a great dam to lock the dragon," after more than a hundred days of fierce fighting, the vast number of laborers are about to realize their ambitious goals. This is not an ordinary construction success; it is a communist red flag planted by collective farmers.
    The 60,000 laborers building the Huairou Reservoir come from 3,477 agricultural cooperatives in twelve counties and districts. Apart from six counties and districts that directly or indirectly benefit from the reservoir, half of the counties and districts do not benefit. However, the farmers trekked through mountains and rivers, bringing their own production tools and living supplies, building their own shacks, and not taking a single penny from the state, contributing their strength to the collective socialist cause. They worked day and night, regardless of sun and rain, working with more enthusiasm and energy than they would for their own village, community, or even personal affairs.

    For the Early Completion of the Reservoir
    Gu'an County, about three hundred miles away from Huairou and having no connection with the reservoir, selected more than 1,600 strong laborers from many volunteers to come to the construction site on foot to participate in the reservoir construction. Among them was an old farmer named Zhao Dezhong, who was over fifty years old. When the laborers were gathered in the county for physical examinations, he was afraid that the higher authorities would not approve his coming to the construction site, so he hid under a large cart, avoiding the examination. After the team was assembled and set off, he quietly carried his bedding and slipped into the ranks. After Zhao Dezhong arrived at the construction site, not only did his labor never lag behind the young people, but he also won the first advanced red flag of the entire squadron a few days later. He stuck this red flag on his small cart filled with sand and soil, and pushed the cart back and forth on the construction site every day, which was very touching. Feng Guangming, a 24-year-old laborer from Xianghe County, signed up for reservoir construction work the day after his wedding. For four months, he has been sticking to his post. His wife also brought him new shoes and socks made by herself, encouraging him to become a model of reservoir construction before returning home.
    On the construction site, on the wheelbarrows, carrying poles, and shovel handles used by the vast number of laborers, one can see the following words everywhere: Rocket Team, Flying Tiger Team, Wu Song Team, Twelve Warriors... Almost all names that can inspire people were taken by the farmers to name their shock brigades. A total of 183 large and small shock brigades were organized on the construction site. In the six all-site award evaluations, thousands of heroes and models emerged. The soaring enthusiasm and unrestrained labor passion of the vast number of laborers are truly indescribable. More than 10,000 laborers from the Xianghe Brigade stood in knee-deep water for three consecutive days and nights without rest to storm a project. Hou Huai and several other young laborers from Jixian County asked the squadron leader Feng Jingshan to take out the book "How Steel Was Tempered" every time they rested and read it to them chapter by chapter to inspire their labor enthusiasm.
    Farmers from thousands of cooperatives, many of whom did not know each other, united and helped each other in common labor and common life, getting along like brothers. Li Huimin, a laborer from the Third Squadron of Jixian County, received a new pair of shoes and a jacket from home, but kept them in his luggage and was reluctant to wear them. However, when he heard that Li Ping from the same team had worn out his shoes and did not have clothes to change, Li Huimin immediately gave his shoes and clothes to Li Ping. Li Ping repeatedly refused at first, but Li Huimin said solemnly, "We are all for the early completion of the reservoir."
    Late at night, in the laborers' residence, one can often see oil lamps flickering. Sitting under the lamps are the old landladies of the laborers, who are using the time when the laborers are asleep to starch, wash, and mend their clothes. The reservoir newsletter published a poem written by a laborer, vividly describing this touching new relationship between people: "Thousands of threads through ten thousand needle holes, the old lady's heart is longer than the thread. I won't go back to my hometown until the reservoir is built, to thank the old lady for her kindness." Laborers Pei Fengbao and Wang Mengxiong, the leader of the laborers' squadron, fell seriously ill. In order to save their lives, Liang Yongchang, Jin Guowen, Zhang Lianyu, and other three laborers and the construction site doctor Qu Yongtai immediately and unhesitatingly donated their blood, turning the patients from danger to safety. The two heroic deeds of selflessly saving others that are widely circulated on the construction site have become models of unity and mutual assistance. Once, the laborer Du Zhongjia saw a wheelbarrow overturn and two stones weighing about 400 kilograms were about to fall into the four-meter-deep cascade; another time, Li Zhenhuan, a student from the Beijing Civil Engineering School, saw a 300-kilogram stone rolling down the mountain. Both warriors bravely rushed up and blocked it with their bodies. Although they were injured themselves, they ensured the safety of the laborers working under the cascade and on the mountainside. Someone on the construction site once wrote these two poems: "A twisted rope cannot be broken, everyone is united and the strength is like a mountain. Encourage each other to compete, and it will not be difficult to build the reservoir." "Labor sheds connected to labor sheds are a big family. Yesterday you and I didn't know each other, today we have become good brothers." These verses vividly express the communist unity and mutual assistance relationship forged by 60,000 people in common labor and common life, and also tell the source of the collective strength of the 60,000 laborers.

    Technological Innovation Creates Records
    At the end of April and the beginning of May, someone listed many arguments and examples of previous reservoir construction, repeatedly proving that it was impossible to improve dam construction efficiency without increasing machines or manpower, and the dam would be abandoned halfway during the flood season. He believed that it would be the limit to create a record of 20,000 cubic meters of earth per day by manpower here. However, after this comrade left the construction site, the 60,000 laborers, relying on their laboring hands and the simplest tools, continuously increased the efficiency of dam construction in a straight line, not only quickly breaking through 20,000 cubic meters, but also creating a record of 32,000 cubic meters of earth per day by manpower for four consecutive days more than a month later.
    The changes in the mental outlook of farmers since the full cooperation, especially the Great Leap Forward, and the growing communist spirit of selflessness are shining in the construction process of the reservoir every day.
    Zhang He, a poor peasant from Sanhe County, disassembled the rear wheel of his beloved bicycle and made a special large-wheeled handcart. He joined the shock brigade named after the hero Huang Jiguang on the construction site and continuously maintained a new record of transporting 13 cubic meters of materials a day, exceeding the quota by 4.3 times. In the six selections of models on the construction site, he won the title of first-class model five times and special-class model once. In the Tongzhou District labor brigade of Beijing City, which has more than 16,000 people, people call the strongman Zhu Yongzhen "Red-Eyed Zhu," not because he really has eye disease, but because he is naturally fond of labor and "envies" work when he sees it. Before coming to the construction site, this farmer, who had been raising pigs for landlords since he was a child, found out where to get the knack, spent his own money to buy the wheels of an old motorcycle, and used it to make a handcart that was huge and unmatched in the entire brigade. He transported nearly 1,000 kilograms of materials each time, and once pushed the cart 24 trips (one way) a day on a 3-mile-long transportation road. Xu Helu, a young shock brigade member from the Jixian County labor brigade, saw that the soil-pushing efficiency of many laborers in his county was somewhat behind that of laborers in other counties shortly after arriving at the construction site. He quietly discussed with six laborers from his village and took out all seven yuan saved from the travel expenses issued to them by the cooperative to buy wood and iron nails. They added movable baffles to the front of their wheelbarrows and widened and heightened the cart, and suddenly these seven people created a new record of pushing 17 cubic meters of soil to the dam every day, exceeding the quota by three times. This spirit of selflessness and public service of Xu Helu and others immediately promoted a movement to reform tools among the laborers in the entire county. All more than 3,000 wheelbarrows in the county were enlarged and widened, and the average efficiency of each laborer pushing soil to the dam was increased four times in more than a month.
    In the laborer's residence of the Huangtuzhuang Squadron in Sanhe County, there is someone who carefully checks the number of wheelbarrows and various tools every night, and must find a way to find them if they are lost; whenever it rains, he also goes to the construction site in the rain to check, fearing that some laborers will lose their tools because they are eager to avoid the rain. People who don't know the situation must think he is a careful and responsible squadron cadre, but this person is actually Shi Gaosheng, the laborer in the squadron who specializes in boiling water. Shi Gaosheng not only boils water every day, but also runs dozens of trips back and forth in the sun and rain, running dozens of miles to deliver the boiled water bucket by bucket to the construction site, ensuring that the laborers do not lack water to drink; he also uses the time when the laborers drink water to push carts and transport materials, ensuring that he transports one cubic meter of materials every day. Shi Gaosheng's spirit of loving national property, loving the collective, and loving the reservoir project moved all the laborers in the team very much, and everyone unanimously elected him as a first-class model on the construction site.

    No Complete Victory, No Withdrawal
    When the struggle with the flood has entered the most intense stage, a very small number of people on the construction site could not withstand the test and wavered in the face of difficulties. But their wavering did not disperse the construction site, but instead further stimulated people's enthusiasm for construction.
    The course of events was as follows: A laborer squadron cadre from Gu'an County who came from a small merchant family, a middle peasant who had only returned from the city to produce last year, they colluded with two other ignorant young laborers, catered to the emotions of some backward laborers, and posted ten big-character posters in front of the county people's committee, attempting to incite the laborers to disband and go home. They publicly declared that if the leadership did not approve their return home, they would "sleep on the construction site today, and not answer or go to work tomorrow." They said that they had only agreed to come to the construction site for three months, and that the reservoir headquarters was "not credible" and "deceived them" if they were not allowed to return home when the time came. To their surprise, these ten big-character posters ignited a raging fire from the opposite side and further strengthened people's determination to overcome the flood. In the week since these ten big-character posters were posted, a vigorous debate was launched throughout the construction site. Tens of thousands of laborers signed their names and posted thousands of big-character posters, giving the "deserters" a firm rebuff. Some people accused them in big-character posters of "making trouble to withdraw troops, making trouble to strike, and deliberately sabotaging the dam construction." Some criticized them for "opposing the leadership, creating opposition, and trying to deceive the vast number of laborers." Some simply issued their iron-like vows to those cowards: "Listen, how firm is the determination of all our laborers: we must build the reservoir, we must fight the battle to victory, and we will never withdraw our troops!" After this storm, the entire construction site maintained a strong morale until the reservoir was completed.

    Collective Strength is Great
    Although the 60,000 laborers who fought at the Huairou Reservoir for more than 100 days did not take a penny in wages, the more than 3,000 agricultural cooperatives to which they belonged will distribute dividends to them in the year's cooperative income according to the quality of their labor on the construction site, and will also take good care of their family lives during the reservoir construction period, supplying all the production and living needs of the laborers, and ensuring that agricultural cooperative production is even better. Therefore, the 60,000 laborers are actually representatives of the voluntary labor sent by all the farmers in the twelve counties and districts, and the completion of the reservoir is actually the collective strength of more than 3,400 agricultural cooperatives.
    This is another glorious example of the great superiority of agricultural cooperation. Today, we should write odes to everyone who has contributed to it, and we should cheer for the main force of reservoir construction—the 60,000 laborers, cheer for their brilliant achievements, and cheer for their communist spirit.

    集体农民的共产主义精神
    ——歌颂建设怀柔水库的六万民工
    拦河大坝巍峨地屹立在两山之间，在怀柔水库青山环抱的人工湖中，现在已经是碧波荡漾。
    “六万雄兵英雄胆，筑起大坝锁蛟龙”，经过一百多个昼夜的鏖战，广大民工即将实现他们的雄心大志。这不是一个普通的建设捷报，这是集体农民插起的一杆共产主义红旗。
    建设怀柔水库的六万民工来自十二个县、区的三千四百七十七个农业合作社，除了六个县、区直接或间接受到水库的效益以外，半数的县、区并不受益，而农民们却跋山涉水，自带一切生产工具和生活用品，自搭工棚，不拿国家一个工钱，为集体的社会主义事业贡献自己的力量。他们不分昼夜，不顾日晒雨淋，劳动起来比对待本乡本村本社以至个人的家业还更加热情充沛，干劲十足。
    为了早日建成水库
    距离怀柔约三百里与水库毫无关系的固安县，从很多自动报名者当中挑选出来的一千六百多名身强力壮的民工，徒步来到工地参加水库建设。其中有一位年已五十开外的老农民赵德仲，当民工们集中在县里检查身体时，害怕上级不批准他来工地，就躲在一辆大车的下面，避过检查，等到大队集中出发以后，他又悄悄地扛起铺盖溜进了队伍。赵德仲来到工地以后，不但劳动从不落在青年人后面，并且几天以后就荣获全中队第一面先进红旗，他把这面红旗插在自己装满沙土的小车上，每天在工地上推起小车来回飞驰，十分动人。香河县二十四岁的民工冯广明结婚第二天就进城报名参加水库建设工作，四个月来，他一直坚守岗位，他爱人也给他捎来亲手做成的新鞋袜，鼓励他当上水库建设的模范再回家。
    在工地广大民工使用的小车、扁担和铁锨把上，到处可以看到写着这样的字样：火箭队、飞虎队、武松队、十二勇士……。几乎所有可以激发人心的名字，都被农民们拿来命名自己的突击队。工地上组织起来的大小突击队一共有一百八十三个。在六次全工地评奖中，更涌现了成千上万的英雄模范。广大民工的冲天干劲和奔放的劳动热情，真是无法用笔墨来形容。香河大队一万多民工为了突击一项工程，曾经站在没膝的水里连续战斗三天三夜没有休息。蓟县青年民工侯怀等几个人，每逢休息就请中队长冯景山拿出“钢铁是怎样炼成的”那本书，逐章逐节地讲给他们听，以激励自己的劳动热情。
    来自几千个合作社的农民，许多人都素不相识，但他们在共同劳动和共同生活中团结互助，相处有如兄弟。蓟县三中队民工李惠民收到家中寄来一双新鞋和一件夹袄，一直放在包袱里舍不得穿，但当他听到同队的李平鞋已穿破，又没有换身衣服的时候，李惠民立刻就把自己的鞋和衣服送给李平。李平开始时再三不肯要，李惠民却很庄重地说：“我们一切都是为了早日修好水库。”
    夜深了，在民工们的驻地，还常常看到盏盏油灯在闪闪发光，灯下坐着民工们的房东老大娘，她们正趁着民工熟睡的时候，为他们浆洗和缝补衣裳。水库小报上登过一位民工写下的诗句，生动地描绘出人们之间这种动人的新关系：“千条线穿着万针孔，大娘的心意比线长。修不成水库不回家乡，答谢大娘一片好心肠。”民工裴风宝和民工中队长王梦熊，得了急病，为了挽救他们的生命，梁永长、晋国文、张连玉等三位民工和工地医生曲永太，立刻毫不犹豫地输出他们的鲜血，使得病人转危为安。工地上广为流传的两件舍己救人的壮举，更是成了人们团结互助的榜样。一次是民工杜忠甲看到一辆小车翻了车，两块约重四百斤的石块马上就要摔到四公尺深的叠水下面；另一次北京土建学校学生李振环看到一块三百斤重的石头正顺山滚下，这两位勇士都奋不顾身地扑上去用自己的身体堵住，虽然他们自己都受了伤，却保证了在叠水下面和山腰间工作的民工们的安全。工地上有人曾写下这样两首诗：“拧成的绳子折不断，大家团结力如山。互相鼓舞搞竞赛，建成水库不费难。”“工棚连工棚，是个大家庭。昨天你我不相识，今天成了好弟兄。”这诗句形象地表达了六万人在共同劳动共同生活中结下的共产主义的团结互助关系，也道出了六万民工集体力量的泉源。
    革新技术创造纪录
    4月底5月初，有人曾经列举许多论据和已往修建水库的实例，一再证明如果不增加机器或者增加人，就不可能提高筑坝效率，大坝就会在汛期前半途而废。他认为如果这里创造出人工每天上坝两万方土的纪录就顶了天了。但是，就在这位同志离开工地以后，六万民工就凭着劳动的双手和最简单的工具，却使筑坝效率不断直线上升，不仅很快突破两万方，并且在一个多月以后，连续四天创造了每天人力上坝三万二千方的纪录。
    全盘合作化特别是大跃进以来农民精神面貌的变化，在他们身上日益增长的那种为公忘私的共产主义精神，每天都在水库的建设过程中闪耀着光辉。
    三河县贫农张贺，把自己心爱的一辆自行车的后车轱辘拆下，赶制成一辆特大的独轮手推车，在工地上参加了以英雄黄继光命名的突击队，连续保持一天运料十三方、超过定额四点三倍的新纪录。工地上六次评选模范，他曾经荣获五次甲等模范和一次特等模范的称号。在一万六千多人的北京市通州区民工大队里，人们都把大力士朱永珍叫做“朱红眼”，不是他真的害眼病，而是因为天生热爱劳动，见活就“眼红”。来工地以前，这位从小给地主放猪的农民不知从哪儿找到的窍门，自己花钱买到一辆破旧摩托车的轮子，用它特制了一辆在全大队硕大无朋的手推车。他每次推料近千斤，曾经在长达三里的运输道上一天推车二十四趟（单程）。蓟县民工大队的青年突击队员许和禄，刚来工地不久，看到自己县里不少民工的推土效率有些落在其他县民工的后面，他就悄悄地同本村同来的六位民工私下商量，把他们从社里发给的路费中节省下来的七元钱，全部拿出来买了木料和铁钉，在他们的独轮小车前面加上活动挡板，把车斗加宽加高，一下子这七个人就创造了每天推土上坝十七方的新纪录，突破定额三倍。许和禄等人这种舍己为公的精神，立刻推动全县民工掀起了一个改革工具的运动，全县三千多辆小车全部改大改宽，每个民工推土上坝的平均效率在一个多月内就提高了四倍。
    在三河县黄土庄中队的民工驻地，每天晚上都有一个人在仔细检查小车和各种工具的数量，发现丢失一定要想尽方法找到；每逢下雨，他还要冒雨走一里多路去到工地察看，生怕有的民工因急于避雨丢掉工具。不了解情况的人，一定以为他是个细心负责的中队干部，其实这个人却是中队上专管烧水的民工石高生。石高生每天不但要烧好开水，不论日晒雨淋，都要往返几十次，跑几十里路把开水一担一担送到工地，保证民工不缺水喝；他并且还利用民工喝水的时间推车运料，每天保证要运料一方。石高生这种热爱国家财产、热爱集体、热爱水库工程的精神，使得全队民工十分感动，大家一致评选他作为工地上的甲等模范。
    不全胜，不撤兵
    当人们同洪水的斗争已进入最紧张阶段的时候，工地上也曾有极少数人经受不住考验，在困难面前动摇了。但他们的动摇并没有使工地涣散，反而更加激发起人们的建设热情。
    事情的经过是这样的：固安县一个小商人出身的民工中队干部，一个去年才由城市回乡生产的中农，他们纠合另外两个不懂事的青年民工，迎合部分落后民工的情绪，在县人民委员会门前贴出了十张大字报，企图煽动民工散伙回家。他们公开声言，如果领导上不批准回家，他们就要“今天工地来睡觉，明天不作答复不上班”。他们说他们原来只答应来工地劳动三个月，到时间不让回家是水库指挥部“不讲信用”，“欺骗了他们”。出乎他们意料之外，这十张大字报却从反面烧起了一把烈火，更加坚定了人们战胜洪水的决心。自从这十张大字报贴出以后的一星期中，整个工地掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的大辩论，几万民工署名贴出了几千张大字报，给几名“逃兵”以坚决的回击。有的人在大字报上斥责他们是“闹撤兵，闹罢工，存心破坏大坝建设”，有的批驳他们是“反领导，闹对立，一心想把广大民工来欺骗”，有的干脆向那些懦弱者发出了自己钢铁般的誓言：“你们听一听，我们全体民工的决心多么坚硬：一定要把水库建成，仗要打不胜，绝对不撤兵！”经过这场风波，整个工地直到水库修成，始终保持了旺盛的士气。
    集体力量大
    六万民工在怀柔水库战斗一百多天虽不拿一个工钱，但他们所在的三千多个农业合作社却要按照他们在工地上劳动的好坏，在当年合作社的收益中给他们分红，并且在修库期间还妥善地照顾他们的家庭生活，供应民工们的一切生产和生活需要，保证农业社生产搞得更好。因此，六万民工实际上是十二个县、区全体农民派出的义务劳动的代表，水库的建成实际上是三千四百多个农业社的集体力量。
    这是农业合作化的巨大优越性的又一光辉例证。今天，我们应该替一切为它出过力量的人写下颂歌，更应该向建设水库的主力军——六万民工欢呼，欢呼他们的辉煌战绩，欢呼他们的共产主义精神。
