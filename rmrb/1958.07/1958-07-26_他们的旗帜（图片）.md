    Their Banner
                    By Formichev (Originally published in the Soviet "Labor Newspaper")
    According to a disclosure by Cairo's "People's Newspaper," the United States wants to "wage a local war in the Middle East to prevent Arab oil from being transported to Europe." The newspaper said that in this way, American oil monopoly capital can increase its sales to Europe and dictate prices. The United States is attempting to improve the situation of the American oil industry through this sinister means.

    据开罗“人民报”揭露，美国想“在中东进行局部战争，使阿拉伯的石油不能运到欧洲去”。这家报纸说，这样一来美国石油垄断资本就可以增加对欧洲的销售量和规定价格。美国企图通过这种罪恶手段使美国石油工业情况好转。
