    Selected New Folk Songs
    What class speaks what words,
    What vine bears what fruit,
    What tree blooms what flower,
    What era loves what person,
    What class speaks what words.
    [Shanghai "Street Art"]
    A Red Heart
    A red lantern shines high in the sky,
    A red heart beats and jumps,
    Jumping so the brick wall grows with the wind,
    In the blink of an eye, the chimney enters the clouds,
    Heart, oh heart, why do you beat?
    Hey, the General Line is announced!
    [Qiqihar "Poetry Handout"]
    New Xintianyou
    Leap Forward songs sung for a year,
    Large jars and small jars are never idle;
    Leap Forward songs sung for two years,
    Large granaries overflow, small granaries are full;
    Leap Forward songs sung for three years,
    Grain piles up like high mountains;
    Leap Forward songs sung for ten years,
    Grain piles exceeding mountains;
    Ten thousand-丈 high mountains cannot compare,
    Grain piles stack to the sky!
    [Xi'an "General Line Poetry Handout"]
    Over Ten Thousand Mountains in One Breath
    Heroes climb high mountains together,
    Lazy people only sit on boats,
    Workers, hearing the General Line,
    Cross ten thousand mountains in one breath!
    Congratulations wear out the pens,
    Beating the drums makes hands ache,
    All because of the General Line,
    Good news piles up to the sky!
    [Chongqing "Red Rock" Monthly Supplement]
    Four Thousand Five Thousand Behind
    In the past, wheat was only a hundred catties,
    Everyone said growing wheat wasn't worth it,
    The year before last, three hundred was top-notch,
    Every farmer was overjoyed.
    Last year, a thousand catties was truly rare,
    Everyone said the yield had broken the sky,
    This year, the single yield is 3215,
    Thinking carefully, there are still shortcomings.
    The land wasn't prepared well, weeds weren't pulled enough,
    This shows the yield hasn't reached its limit,
    This year, put in even more effort,
    Four thousand five thousand are behind.
    [Wuhan "Yangtze Literature" Monthly Supplement]

    新民歌选
    什么阶级说什么话
    什么藤结什么瓜，
    什么树开什么花，
    什么时代爱什么人，
    什么阶级说什么话。
    〔上海“街头文艺”〕
    一颗红心
    一盏红灯高空照，
    一颗红心蹦蹦跳，
    跳得砖墙随风长，
    转眼烟囱入云霄，
    心啊心啊为啥跳？
    嗨，总路线公布了！
    〔齐齐哈尔“诗传单”〕
    新信天游
    跃进歌儿唱一年，
    大瓮小瓮不空闲；
    跃进歌儿唱两年，
    大囤儿流小囤满；
    跃进歌儿唱三年，
    粮食堆得像高山；
    跃进歌儿唱十年，
    粮食堆堆超过山；
    万丈高山不能比，
    粮食堆堆堆上天！
    〔西安“总路线诗传单”〕
    一气翻过万重山
    英雄一齐登高山，
    懒汉才坐下水船，
    工人听了总路线，
    一气翻过万重山！
    贺喜把笔都写烂，
    敲锣把手也打酸，
    皆因有了总路线，
    喜报多得堆上天！
    〔重庆“红岩”月刊附页〕
    四千五千在后边
    过去小麦不过百，
    都说种麦合不来，
    前年三百是特等，
    个个农民喜开怀。
    去年千斤真稀罕，
    都说产量顶破天，
    今年单产3215，
    细想还是有缺点。
    地没整好草少薅，
    说明产量没到边，
    今年再鼓一把劲，
    四千五千在后边。
    〔武汉“长江文艺”月刊附页〕
