    The Chinese People Will Always Support the People of the Middle East

    Heroic Words

    The U.S. and British imperialists have murdered innocent Koreans and Egyptians, and now extend their bloodstained hands to murder the people of Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to stifle the national liberation movement in the Middle East. War-mongers Eisenhower, Dulles, and Macmillan, I warn you, recall the shameful lessons learned in Korea and Egypt! Those who play with fire will be burned. Victory will always belong to the righteous!

    Despite whatever excuses you fabricate there, you cannot fool even a three-year-old. People all over the world are condemning your naked aggression.

    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. To defend the socialist construction of the motherland and support the Arab people, I must further study military technology, improve combat training in the troops, master the weapons in my hands, and improve the combat effectiveness of the troops. At the same time, I will increase vigilance a hundredfold and struggle tirelessly for the cause of peace. I repeat, I will always firmly support the national independence movement of the Arab people. If the war-mongers dare to act recklessly, they will surely be smashed to pieces. Victory will surely belong to the Arab people.
                    First-Class Demolition Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Huang Jiafu

    Support Our Middle Eastern Brothers with Our Labor and Production!

    We hail the establishment of the Republic of Iraq with immense joy. This is another manifestation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind. We also protest with utmost anger against the U.S. and British imperialists sending troops to Lebanon and Jordan, threatening the newly established Republic of Iraq. We must all use our full strength to support the just anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people.

    All our cooperative members will intensify production, improve technology, and ensure a great leap forward in agriculture and industry, guaranteeing a per-mu yield of over 1,000 catties of rice. We have already defeated U.S. imperialism in the Korean War, and this year we have surpassed the United States in wheat production. We must go all out, aim high, and support our Middle Eastern brothers with our labor and production.
               All Members of the Yangzhuangzi Agricultural Production Cooperative, Beijing

    Do Not Allow American Imperialism to Act Tyrannically

    When I heard that U.S. imperialist aggressor troops had landed in Lebanon, I was furious! The blood debt of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea has not yet been paid. Today, it wants to inflict disaster on the people of Lebanon and the Arab world. Such jackal behavior cannot but remind me of May 11, 1953, when U.S. imperialist planes invaded the airspace of Andong City in our motherland, bombing off my right hand and injuring my face and head. For several years, I have never forgotten this blood debt. Every time I work and pick up tools, strike a match to light a cigarette, eat, or even every moment, I think of the pain and disaster caused to me by U.S. imperialism. Today, U.S. imperialism wants to bring this disaster to the Arab people. I absolutely cannot agree! I want to tell my personal experience to millions of people, so that all will support the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and the Arab world, oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism, drive them out of the Middle East, and defend world peace.

    I am a railway patroller. I must complete my patrol work, actively participate in the industrial "anti-drought," and use this one hand to pick up more scrap iron and steel to support the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and the Arab world. If U.S. imperialism disregards the warnings of the people of the world and dares to continue to act tyrannically, I will stand with the people of Lebanon and the Arab world, and use this angry hand to beat them until their heads are broken and they flee in disarray.

        The Imperialists' Conspiracy of Aggression Is Bound to Fail

    We are demobilized and retired soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the past, we fought against aggression and defended peace. Some of us participated in the war to defeat Japanese imperialism, some participated in the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, and some even participated in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. When the peaceful construction of the motherland needed us, we came to the positions of industrial construction. Today, the U.S. and British imperialists are again provoking peace. They are carrying out armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan, threatening the independence movement of the Middle Eastern people, and threatening world peace. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. We love peace. We once regarded defending the motherland and world peace as our sacred duty. Therefore, we will never allow U.S. and British imperialism to destroy world peace again. We will work with the Arab people to defeat the aggressors' conspiracy. Our experience tells us that imperialist aggression can be completely defeated, and the just struggle against colonialism will surely be victorious!

      We Stand Behind the Brave Arab People

    On the third day of the founding of the Republic of Iraq, U.S. and British imperialism, driven to desperation, simply tore off their masks and revealed their true jackal faces. They sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan. They want to create a fait accompli, and then coerce the United Nations, steal its flag, and piece together some forces to carry out another act of robbery while the house is on fire. They have never had the Arab people in mind, nor have they ever taken the people of the world seriously. They still have the old, hideous, barbaric face of gunboat policy and colonialism!

    We strongly protest against this act of aggression! The U.S. and British imperialists should immediately withdraw their claws, immediately withdraw their invading troops, and not interfere in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Arab countries, let alone threaten or infringe upon the newly established Republic of Iraq in any way. Otherwise, this time the U.S. and British imperialists will inevitably and quickly suffer the most shameful and head-breaking defeat!

    Lebanon, Iraq, and the Arab people fighting for justice are by no means isolated. The 600 million people of our People's Republic of China, the people of Asia and Africa, and all peace-loving people in the world stand behind them, fully supporting their just anti-aggression struggle. We firmly believe that the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Arab people.

    We, along with the people of the whole country, pledge with all our strength and all our efforts to resolutely carry this struggle through to the end, and to stand behind the brave Arab people!
                          Tao Menghe and six others (signatures), Chinese Academy of Sciences

      Annihilate the Aggressors Wherever They Go!

    We firmly protest against the shameless act of armed aggression by British and American imperialism against Jordan and Lebanon. The British and American invading troops must withdraw immediately.

    The Lebanese people's opposition to Chamoun's rule and the unstable situation in Jordan are the inevitable results of tyrannical rule. The victory of the Iraqi revolution is a just act of the people overthrowing the traitorous government. These are all internal affairs. The people of the three countries have the right to do so themselves. The act of aggression by British and American imperialism seriously violates the UN Charter and must get out of Jordan and Lebanon.

    If British and American imperialism insist on their aggressive actions, we Chinese people, for justice and for world peace, firmly support the statement of our government. We will definitely fully support the just actions of the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, thoroughly smash the aggressors, and annihilate the aggressors wherever they go.

        Rage is Burning

    These past two days, the fire of rage is burning in the hearts of each of us!

    The masked robbers have finally revealed their hideous true faces. The U.S. and British imperialist jackals have been driven to desperation, not bothering to disguise themselves, and have rushed into the lands of the Arab people in a frantic and ferocious manner. They want to relive the old dreams of a hundred years ago, attempting to conquer the people of other countries with warships and cannons, in order to establish their colonial rule. But now is no longer the era of imperialist dominance. Now is the era of national awakening, the era of the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Eisenhower, Dulles, Macmillan and their ilk have simply miscalculated, mistaking the sunset glow of their own twilight years for the morning glow of the East!

    All the faculty and staff of our Petroleum Cadre School fully support the statements of our government and the Soviet government, standing on the side of the Arab people, and regard the struggle of the Arab people as our own struggle. We firmly demand that the U.S. and British invading troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan and restore peace in the Middle East! The internal affairs of the people of Asia and Africa should be resolved by the people of Asia and Africa themselves, and no one is allowed to interfere!

    We warn the U.S. and British imperialists that if they are ignorant of the times and insist on acting recklessly, they will accelerate their own rapid demise, and they will be reduced to ashes in the rage of the peace-loving people of the whole world.
　　　　　　　　　　　　All Faculty and Staff of the Cadre School of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    英雄的话
    美英帝国主义者杀害了无辜的朝鲜人、埃及人，现在又伸出血淋淋的双手，来杀害黎巴嫩和约旦人民，妄想扼杀中东的民族解放运动。战争贩子艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、麦克米伦，警告你们，好好回忆一下在朝鲜和埃及无耻的教训吧！玩火者是要自焚的，胜利永远属于正义的人们。
    尽管你们在那里捏造什么借口，连三岁的小孩也骗不过去。全世界人民都在谴责你们这赤裸裸的侵略罪行。
    我是一个解放军战士，为了保卫祖国社会主义建设，支援阿拉伯人民，我一定要进一步钻研军事技术，搞好部队战斗训练，掌握手中武器，提高部队战斗力。同时百倍提高警惕，为和平事业而不懈斗争。我再说一遍，我永远坚决支持阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动，战争贩子如果胆敢胡为，一定要碰得头破血流，胜利一定属于阿拉伯的人民。
                    中国人民解放军一级爆破英雄　黄家富
    用我们的劳动生产来支持中东兄弟！
    我们以无比喜悦的心情来欢呼伊拉克共和国的成立，这是东风压倒西风的又一次表现。我们也以无比愤怒的心情来抗议美英帝国主义出兵黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁新成立的伊拉克共和国，我们大家一定用我们的全部力量来支持阿拉伯人民正义的反帝斗争。
    我们全体社员一定加紧生产，改进技术，使农业和工业一起大跃进，保证水稻亩产千斤以上。我们在朝鲜战争中已打败过美帝国主义，今年又在小麦的产量上超过了美国，我们一定鼓足干劲，力争上游，用我们的劳动生产来支持中东兄弟。
               北京杨庄子农业生产合作社全体社员
    不准美帝横行霸道
    当我听说美帝国主义侵略军在黎巴嫩登陆时，我非常愤怒！美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的血债还没有还清，今天，他又要把灾难强加在黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人民的身上，这种豺狼行为不能不让我回忆起1953年5月11日，那一天美帝国主义飞机侵入祖国安东市的上空，炸掉了我的右手，炸伤了我的脸和头。几年来我一直没有忘记这笔血债，每当我劳动拿起工具，吸烟划火柴，吃饭端起饭碗，甚至每时每刻，都要想起美帝国主义给我造成的痛苦和灾难。今天，美帝国主义又想把这种灾难带给阿拉伯人民，我决不能答应！我要把亲身的遭遇告诉成千上万的人民，都来支援黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，反对美帝国主义的侵略，把他们赶出中东，保卫世界和平。
    我是一个铁路巡守员，我要完成巡守工作，我要积极参加工业“抗旱”，我要用这一只手拾起更多的废钢铁，支援黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。美帝国主义要是不顾世界人民的警告，胆敢继续横行霸道，我要跟黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人民站在一起，用我这一只愤怒的手，打得他们头破血流，狼狈而逃。
                                  安东铁路机务段　孙德贤
        帝国主义的侵略阴谋一定失败
    我们是中国人民解放军的转业复员军人。过去我们曾经为反对侵略、保卫和平进行过战斗。我们有的参加过打败日本帝国主义侵略的战争，有的参加过推翻蒋介石的反动统治，有的人还参加过伟大的抗美援朝斗争。在祖国和平建设事业需要我们的时候，我们来到了工业建设的岗位。今天，美英帝国主义者又在向和平挑衅了，他们武装干涉黎巴嫩、约旦的内政，威胁中东人民的独立运动，威胁世界和平。这是我们绝不能容忍的。我们热爱和平，我们曾经把保卫祖国和世界和平作为自己神圣的职责，因此我们决不允许美英帝国主义再来破坏世界和平。我们要和阿拉伯人民一起来打垮侵略者的阴谋。我们的经验告诉我们，帝国主义的侵略是完全可以打败的，反殖民主义的正义斗争一定能胜利！

      我们为英勇的阿拉伯人民作后盾
    在伊拉克共和国成立的第三天，美英帝国主义便狗急跳墙地索性撕破假面具，露出豺狼的真面目来了。他们派军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦。他们想造成既成事实，再去胁迫联合国，盗用其旗号，拼凑些力量再作一次趁火打劫。他们心目中自来便没有阿拉伯人民，也自来不把全世界人民放在眼里，依然是一副炮舰政策的殖民主义狰狞野蛮的旧面目！
    我们严重抗议这种侵略行为！美英帝国主义者应马上收回魔手，立即撤退侵略军，不许干涉黎巴嫩及阿拉伯国家的内政，更不许对新成立的伊拉克共和国稍加威胁稍加侵犯。否则美英帝国主义者这一次必然很快地遭受到最可耻的、头破血流的失败！
    黎巴嫩、伊拉克以及为正义斗争的阿拉伯人民，决不是孤立的。我们中华人民共和国的六亿人民和亚非人民以及全世界爱好和平的人们，都站在他们后面，全力支援他们的这一反侵略的正义斗争。我们完全相信最后的胜利一定是属于英勇的阿拉伯人民。
    我们与全国人民一起誓以一切力量，尽一切努力，坚决地把这一斗争贯彻到底，来为英勇的阿拉伯人民作后盾！
                          中国科学院　陶孟和等六人签名
      侵略者到那里，就把它消灭在那里！
    我们坚决抗议英美帝国主义武装侵略约旦和黎巴嫩的无耻行为，英美侵略部队必须立刻撤退。
    黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙的统治，约旦国内不稳定的局势，都是暴君统治导致的必然结果，伊拉克革命的胜利是人民推翻卖国政府的正义行为。这些都是内政问题，三国人民自己有权利这样做。英美帝国主义的侵略行为严重触犯了联合国宪章，必须从约旦、黎巴嫩滚回去。
    英美帝国主义如果坚持他们的侵略行动，我们中国人民为了正义，为了世界和平，坚决拥护我国政府的声明，我们一定全力支持黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克人民的正义行为，彻底粉碎侵略者，侵略者到那里就把它消灭在那里。
　　　　　　　　　　　　中央气象局　涂长望、卢鋈
        怒火在燃烧
    这两天，我们每一个人心中的怒火都在燃烧！
    蒙面强盗终于露出了他们的狰狞本相。美英帝国主义豺狼已经是狗急跳墙，顾不得乔装打扮，就气急败坏而又穷凶极恶地扑进了阿拉伯人民的土地。他们想重温百年前的旧梦，妄想以军舰大炮征服别国人民，以建立起他们的殖民统治。但是现在已经不是帝国主义者称王道霸的时代了，现在是全民觉醒的时代，东风压倒西风的时代。艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯、麦克米伦之流简直错打了算盘，把他们自己的日暮黄昏的回光返照还当成是东方朝霞呢！
    我们石油干校的全体教职员工，完全拥护我国政府和苏联政府的声明，站在阿拉伯人民一边，把阿拉伯人民的斗争看成是我们自己的斗争。我们坚决要求美英侵略军立即滚出黎巴嫩和约旦，恢复中东和平！亚非人民的内部事务由亚非人民自己解决，决不允许任何人干涉！
    我们警告美、英帝国主义者，要是不识时务，硬要蛮干下去的话，他们将促进自己的迅速死亡，他们将在全世界爱好和平人民的怒火中化为灰烬。　　　　　　　　　石油工业部干部学校全体教职员工
