    People in Jilin, Anhui, Zhejiang and other provinces
    Dig Wells and Springs to Overcome Drought
    Rainfall in Some Drought-Stricken Areas of Heilongjiang and Hunan
    (By our report) From July 25th to 30th, except for most areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, other provinces had rainfall successively. The drought in northern Heilongjiang, the Liaodong Peninsula, and Changbai Mountain has been relieved, and the drought situation in some drought-stricken areas of Hunan Province is also expected to ease. Currently, the people of Jilin, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces are working hard, making continuous efforts to eliminate the threat of drought and ensure a bumper autumn harvest.
    Since the beginning of July, except for the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Tonghua area in Jilin Province, which have recently received rain, other areas have generally been without rain. Coupled with the strong warm air mass bringing historically rare high temperatures (reaching a maximum of 37 degrees Celsius), the drought has become even more severe. The leaves of various crops are generally rolled up and turning yellow, and paddy fields are gradually drying up due to lack of water sources. At present, it is the period when various crops are heading, flowering, and pollinating, requiring a large amount of water. Therefore, the entire province has launched a drought resistance movement. Currently, four million people across the province are fighting drought day and night, having dug more than 50,000 new wells and more than 17,000 springs, irrigating more than 7 million mu of dry and paddy fields.
    In this drought resistance effort, all counties have criticized various erroneous ideas through debate sessions and on-site meetings, and have emphasized carrying forward the spirit of communism and carrying out nationwide drought resistance cooperation. The cars of the food, forestry, public security, and forestry industry departments of many counties have gone to the countryside to support drought resistance. All agencies and mass organizations in Jilin Province have stopped working for a week since July 25 to focus on drought resistance. The province has transferred hundreds of thousands of cadres and officers and soldiers, led by party and government leaders, to go to cities and counties with severe drought to assist in drought resistance. A large number of citizens and students have also automatically gone to the countryside to support the struggle to resist drought and ensure a good harvest, and will never stop until a complete victory is achieved.
    Most areas of Anhui Province have still not received rain. The drought-affected area in the province has reached more than 21 million mu, of which more than 7 million mu are severely affected and the land is cracked. However, in order to ensure a bumper autumn harvest, the people of Anhui Province have launched a drought resistance movement combining large-scale water conservancy construction, tool reform, fertilizer accumulation, and field management. At present, more than 12 million farmers across the province are involved in the drought resistance struggle, having resisted drought and replanted more than 64 million mu of various crops, which is more than 9 million mu more than in the same period last year. The province has dug more than 160,000 deep ditches and ponds, opened more than 240,000 diversion ditches, dug more than 1.04 million wells, found springs and lowered springs in more than 850,000 places, and built more than 145,000 dams. The development of the drought resistance movement has also promoted the reform of water lifting tools. Many townships and communities throughout the province have generally used improved water lifting tools. After seven days and seven nights of hard work, Tongcheng County had modified and newly manufactured 48,590 various new-style waterwheels by July 6. Wangjiang County, after three days and nights of struggle, basically realized the use of wind power to draw water and irrigate with ditches.
    Various places, in conjunction with the drought resistance struggle, have also adopted various methods for accumulating fertilizer and managing fields.
    In Zhejiang Province, in the past half month, the drought in the northern and western Ningbo, Jiaxing, and Jinhua areas has continued to develop. The drought-affected area in the province has reached more than 3 million mu. In order to realize the provincial party committee's call for "ensuring a bumper harvest with no rain for half a year," the drought-affected areas are digging underground water and carrying out large-scale gravity irrigation.
    The people of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province are also continuing to fight against drought. (With pictures)

    吉林、安徽、浙江等省人民
    打井挖泉战胜旱灾
    黑龙江湖南部分受旱地区已经下雨
    本报讯　25日至30日，除山东、江苏、安徽三省大部地区未下雨外，其他各省都先后有雨。黑龙江北部和辽东半岛、长白山旱象已经解除，湖南省的部分受旱地区也可望缓和旱象。现在，吉林、安徽、浙江等省人民，正鼓足干劲，再接再励，消除干旱威胁，确保秋季丰收。
    7月初以来，吉林省除延边朝鲜族自治州、通化专区最近下了雨外，其他地区普遍无雨，加以强大的暖气团带来历史上少有的高温（最高达到三十七度）气候，旱象更加严重。各种农作物的叶子普遍打卷、变黄，水田因缺乏水源逐渐干涸。而目前正是各种作物抽穗、开花扬粉，需要大量水分时期。因此，全省展开了抗旱运动。目前，全省每天有四百万人日夜同干旱作战，已打新井五万多眼，挖泉一万七千多个。浇了水旱田七百多万亩。
    在此次抗旱中，各县都通过辩论会和现场会议，批判了各种错误思想，并都强调发扬共产主义精神，开展全民性的抗旱大协作。许多县的粮食、林业、公安、森工等部门的汽车，都下乡支援抗旱，吉林省各机关和群众团体，自7月25日起停止办公一星期，突击抗旱。全省已抽调数十万干部、官兵，由党政负责同志率领，分赴旱象严重的市县协助抗旱。大批市民和学生也自动下乡支援抗旱保收斗争，不获全胜，绝不收兵。
    安徽省大部地区仍未下雨。全省受旱面积已达二千一百多万亩，其中受旱严重、田地龟裂的有七百多万亩。但是，为保证秋季大丰收，安徽全省人民已展开了一个结合大量兴修水利、改革工具、积肥和田间管理的抗旱运动。目前全省投入抗旱斗争的农民有一千二百多万人，已抗旱抢种各种作物六千四百多万亩，比去年同期还多种了九百多万亩。全省已在抗旱中挖深沟深塘十六万多处，开引水沟二十四万多条，打井一百零四万多眼，找泉、下泉八十五万多处，并打拦河坝十四万五千多处。抗旱运动的开展，也推动了提水工具的改革。全省已有很多乡、社普遍使用改良的提水工具。桐城县经过七天七夜苦战，到7月6日已改制和新制各种新式水车四万八千五百九十部，望江县经过三昼夜的奋斗，就基本实现了用风力车水，用沟渠灌溉。
    各地结合抗旱斗争，还采取多种多样的办法进行积肥和田间管理。
    浙江省近半月来，北部西部宁波、嘉兴、金华等专区旱情也续有发展。全省受旱面积已经达到三百万亩以上。受旱地区为实现省委“半年无雨保丰收”的号召，正在挖掘地下水，大搞自流灌溉。
    江苏镇江、扬州、苏州三个专区的人民也继续在同干旱斗争中。（附图片）
