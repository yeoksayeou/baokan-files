    The Pirate Flag
    Exposed in Broad Daylight
    I was very happy to read the People's Daily editorial "Eisenhower's Flag is a Pirate Flag." It is indeed a good article.

    When American imperialism shamelessly and with all its might used all kinds of sophistry to justify its invasion of the Middle East, we were all filled with righteous indignation. The editorial at this moment opened up the old history of American imperialism, ruthlessly exposing the pirates' disguise. Although short in length, every word and every sentence is like a sharp sword and dagger, deeply inserted into the throat of the aggressors, allowing no quibbling. The forceful argumentation is truly satisfying, giving Eisenhower a particularly resounding slap in the face with America's own history, exposing the pirate flag—Eisenhower's flag—in broad daylight!

    Literature and Art Release Brilliant Colors
    In the past few days, the People's Daily's eighth page has published many short and powerful literary and artistic works against the Anglo-American invasion of the Middle East and in support of the Middle Eastern people's anti-colonial struggle, including poems, clapper talks, square performances, current affairs Peking opera, and so on. This not only demonstrates the literary and art workers' clear-cut internationalist sentiments but also conducts a vivid patriotic and internationalist education for the broad masses of people. In addition, it has brought a lot of convenience to our literary and art propaganda work, especially the clapper talk performances and current affairs Peking opera are very useful to us.

    Hope for Introduction of Teaching Reform Experiences
    Everyone likes to read the examples of leaps forward in various fields published in the newspaper. These reports not only help various regions exchange experiences but also encourage everyone's work enthusiasm. However, as a teacher, I always feel that the People's Daily reports relatively few examples of leaps forward and innovations in teaching. I hope to increase reports in this area to help teachers in various regions improve teaching quality.

    Expand the Coverage of Sports Reports
    I am a long-term reader of your newspaper, and I feel that your newspaper's reports in all aspects are very rich, except that the coverage of sports news is not broad enough. I hope that your newspaper can publish more sports news in the future, such as important domestic competitions and international championship competitions.

    Publish More of This Kind of Data
    After reading the "Statistics of High Wheat Yield Records" published on the second page on July 2nd and the third page on July 12th, "How Many Kinds of Cars Have Been Made This Year?" I felt that this kind of data is very good. In a small space, with concise numbers and facts, the inventions, creations, or great leaps in production in one area are systematically introduced to the readers. I hope to also use this method to report on achievements in other areas, such as: the situation of tractor manufacturing, high-yield records of early rice, and so on.

     I Don't Like This Title
      The People's Daily third page on July 10th published an article in the "Dare to Think, Dare to Speak, Dare to Do" column introducing the story of Zhang Jixiang, a mechanic and Communist Party member at the Zhangshan Mining Area of the Sichuan State-owned Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, breaking superstitions and making foreign machine parts. The article is very vivid and inspiring after reading it. However, the title of this article, "The Person Who Makes Foreign Things," brings some uncomfortable feelings. It is clear that the things were made by Chinese people on Chinese land, why insist on calling them "foreign things"? "The Person Who Makes Foreign Things" is so awkward! It might be better if quotation marks were added to "foreign things."

    海盗的旗帜
    被抛在光天化日之下
    读到人民日报“艾森豪威尔的旗帜就是海盗的旗帜”的社论，非常高兴。它的确是一篇好文章。
    当美帝国主义恬不知耻、用尽一切心机来为自己出兵侵略中东诡辩时，我们都义愤填膺。社论正是在这时掀开了美国帝国主义的老家底，无情地戳穿了海盗们的伪装。虽然篇幅不多，但每个词、每句话都像利剑匕首，深深地插在侵略者的喉舌上，不容狡辩。有力的论证真是大快人心，以美国本国的历史给了艾森豪威尔一记特别响亮的耳光，把海盗的旗帜——艾森豪威尔的旗帜抛在光天化日之下，暴露无遗了！　解放军读者　江润
    文艺放奇彩
    这几天，人民日报第八版刊登了许多反对美英侵略中东、支援中东人民反殖民主义斗争的短小精悍的文艺作品，有诗歌、快板、广场剧、时事京剧等等。这不仅表现了文艺工作者爱憎分明的国际主义情感，对广大人民群众也进行了生动的爱国主义与国际主义的教育。此外，给我们的文艺宣传工作带来了很多方便，特别是快板剧和时事京剧对我们很有用。

    希望介绍教学改革经验
    报上登载的关于各个方面跃进的事例，大家都很喜欢看。这些报道不仅帮助各地交流了经验，也鼓舞了大家的工作热情。但是，作为一个教员，我总觉得人民日报关于教学上跃进和革新的事例报道得比较少。希望增加这方面的报道，帮助各地教师提高教学质量。

    体育报道面再广些
    我是你报的长期读者，我对你报各方面的报道，都感到很丰富，唯独体育方面的消息报道面不广。我希望你报今后能够多登一点体育消息，如国内的重要比赛，国际的锦标比赛等。　越南华侨　黄欢新
    多登这样的资料
    读了人民日报7月2日第二版和12日第三版上刊载的“小麦高产纪录统计”和“今年已经制成了多少种汽车？”，我感到这种资料很好。在不大的篇幅里，以简明的数字和事实，将一个方面的发明创造或生产大跃进的情况，系统地介绍给读者。我希望也用这种方法报道其他方面的成就，如：制造拖拉机的情况，早稻的高产纪录等。

     不喜欢这个标题
      7月10日人民日报三版“敢想敢说、敢做”栏里发表了一篇介绍四川省国营乐山磷肥厂张山采矿场的机修工、共产党员张吉祥打破迷信、制作外国机器配件的故事。文章很生动，读后很有启发。但是这篇文章的标题“制造洋东西的人”，却给人带来了一些不舒服的感觉。明明是中国人在中国的土地上制造出来的东西，为什么硬要叫“洋东西”呢？“制造洋东西的人”，多别扭！如果在“洋东西”上加上引号，可能好些。
