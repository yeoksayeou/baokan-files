Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Millions of peace-loving Chinese mothers strongly condemn the American and British aggressors for creating heinous wars in the Middle East. They appeal to all conscientious, righteous people around the world who care about children and the future of humanity to step forward and stop the wars of aggression.

In the powerful demonstrations against American and British aggression that have erupted nationwide, women's protest rallies and demonstrations are taking place everywhere. Mothers express, "We cannot forget the suffering of the millions of widows and orphans left behind by the imperialist wars of aggression!" "We can no longer watch Middle Eastern women live under the iron heel and humiliation of imperialism!" "We firmly support the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people against aggression!"

According to statistics from Hebei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 14 million women have held protest rallies and demonstrations. In reality, the voices of women's protests resonate throughout the country. Women in vast cities and rural areas, families of martyrs and military personnel, mothers with many children, childcare workers, peace activists, ethnic minority women, returned overseas Chinese, and women in religious circles, all realize their serious responsibility for saving peace, and all condemn the instigators of war with angry hearts.

The protest rallies of women in various regions have formed thousands upon thousands of gatherings of blood and tears of denunciation. Chen Guizhen, the wife of "February 7th" martyr Lin Xiangqian, who lives in Minhou County, Fujian Province, angrily denounced the crimes of imperialism at a forum for women from all walks of life in Fujian Province. She condemned the adventurous actions of American and British imperialism, saying that the oppressed and enslaved people have stood up today, and the era of imperialist arrogance has passed. She warned American and British imperialism to immediately withdraw their claws of aggression, or they will surely reap the consequences of their evil deeds. Hu Wenxiu, the mother of revolutionary heroine Liu Hulan, convened a meeting of all the women in her agricultural cooperative to denounce the bloody debt of imperialism after hearing the news of the American and British aggression in the Middle East. More than 400 women from this agricultural cooperative also carried signs protesting against American and British aggression in the Middle East and held a torchlight parade overnight, and continued to demonstrate for three days. The women angrily shouted, "Remember the blood debts owed by imperialism!" "We cannot allow imperialism to bully the people of the Middle East again!" Li Chunpei, a well-known "Five-Good" activist in Wuhan who attended the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation, denounced that American and British imperialism turned many children into orphans when they invaded Korea. Now, the American and British robbers have turned the smiling faces of many children in the Middle East into crying faces. We peace-loving Chinese mothers have a responsibility to stop war and defend peace. A sense of maternal responsibility led Li Chunpei to participate in the demonstration despite her illness, and she resolutely signed to protest against the aggressive crimes of the United States and Britain. Many people in Wuhan still find it hard to forget the atrocities of American soldiers collectively raping Chinese women in Jingming Building in Wuhan. Cheng Fengyi, a 60-year-old housewife, denounced this incident at a street women's gathering. She said that American soldiers were so barbaric even when they were flying the banner of "friendly nations." How can we allow our Middle Eastern sisters to suffer the trampling of American and British troops today!

In Andong and Shenyang, many widows whose husbands were taken away by American aggressors during the Korean War angrily denounced the crimes of American imperialism. An old lady Yu in Andong, who has six children, lost her husband tragically under the bombs of American planes. She called on the sisters in her neighborhood to resolutely rise up against the American and British robbers and firmly support the struggle of their Middle Eastern sisters. A female worker, Wang Guizhi, in Shenyang lost her husband in the war of aggression against Korea launched by the United States. She angrily said at a factory meeting: "The American and British invading forces are launching a war in the Middle East and want to create more widows and orphans. We resolutely disagree." In Xian Shuigu Town, Hebei Province, there is a 75-year-old woman, Li, whose son was fed to wolves by Japanese imperialism, and even his body was never found. This old lady recently wrote a protest letter, saying: "American and British imperialism and Japanese imperialism are the same thing. They are all like jackals that harm and eat people. They want the mothers of Middle Eastern countries to lose their sons. This is absolutely not allowed. I am qualified to represent the mothers in resolutely protesting!"

Childcare workers and female teachers who are diligently nurturing the next generation have lodged strong protests against the American and British aggressors. Childcare workers in Tianjin, Harbin, Guiyang, Xining, and other cities have all stated that they must resolutely stop the war of aggression. They said that after liberation, the children of our country live happily under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government. In order to make children all over the world happy, we cannot stand idly by while the United States and Britain invade the Middle East. Zhang Muzhao, a nursery worker at the Hequn Road Nursery in Guiyang City, said: What we think and do every day is to enable children to grow up happily, but American and British imperialism are creating wars and not allowing children to live a peaceful and happy life. We childcare workers must resolutely oppose these inhuman warmongers. Mothers who were giving birth at the Hunan Provincial Maternity and Child Health Hospital wrote a protest letter titled "We Cannot Tolerate" after hearing the news. They wrote: "We all know the hatred of wars of aggression. The reason why our children can be born peacefully in a beautiful environment today is because we have a strong socialist motherland." These mothers said: "We cannot stand idly by while the United States and Britain invade the people of the Middle East. We must support the people of the Middle East with practical actions."

Many families of military personnel wrote letters to their sons, urging them to learn their skills well, hold the guns in their hands tightly, vigilantly defend the motherland, and be ready to strike any aggressors at any time. Women in Fujian and Zhejiang have stated that we will never forget that the US military is still occupying our territory of Taiwan. We must work even harder to produce and do everything possible to assist the Chinese People's Liberation Army in fighting the provocations of the American aggressors. The female workers of the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory have recently launched a "Week of Supporting the Struggle of the Arab People." In Nanning, some female factory workers launched a campaign of "Everyone Doing One Thing to Support the Just Struggle of the Arab People." In this campaign, female workers generally broke through their production quotas. Women from all regions have said that mothers love peace the most, but liberated Chinese women are never afraid of war. More than a dozen ethnic minority women in Yunnan recently held a protest rally in Kunming. The Dai women from the border areas revealed at the meeting the various crimes committed by the US military in the Dai area back then. They said that we Dai women are determined to join the people of the whole country in supporting the just struggle of the Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 28th: Women of all ethnic groups in Urumqi actively participate in various rallies and demonstrations to protest against the US and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East.

Maimuer (Uyghur), director of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Women's Federation, is extremely angry at the American and British imperialist armed interference in the internal affairs of the Arab people. She said that not long ago, she participated in the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo, which severely condemned the criminal Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine. The victory of the Iraqi revolution is in line with the strong desire of the Iraqi people to get rid of the shackles of colonialism, and we express our warm congratulations. The hearts of the Chinese women of all ethnic groups are forever linked with the hearts of the peace-loving Asian and African women. We firmly oppose the American and British imperialist interference in the internal affairs of the people of the Middle East, and oppose the aggressors humiliating and oppressing innocent Arab women and children. The barbaric actions of imperialism will inevitably end in shameful failure. Nulila, a Kazakh martyr's family member living in the Dosluk area, said that imperialists are always unwilling to die. Imperialism is like flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows. It always harms people. We must fully support the people of the Middle East and stop imperialist aggression. Uyghur childcare worker Mai Xiyamu said that I will never allow the American and British aggressors to oppress Arab women, sisters, and children. I must educate the children about the crimes of the American and British aggressors so that they understand that imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world.

    在安东市和沈阳市，许多被美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中夺去了丈夫的寡妇，激愤地控诉了美帝国主义的罪行。安东市一位有六个孩子的于大娘，她的丈夫惨死在美国飞机的炸弹之下，她呼吁邻居的姐妹们要坚决地起来反对美英强盗，坚决支持中东姐妹们的斗争。沈阳市一位女工王桂芝，在美国发动的侵朝战争中失去了丈夫，她在工厂的集会上愤怒地说：“美英侵略军在中东发动战争，又想制造更多的寡妇孤儿，我们坚决不答应”。河北省的咸水沽镇，有一位七十五岁的李大娘，她的儿子曾被日本帝国主义喂了狼狗，连尸首都没有找到，这位老大娘最近写了抗议书，她说：“美英帝国主义和日本帝国主义是一样的货色，它们都像豺狼一样的害人、吃人，它们想叫中东国家的母亲们失去儿子，这决不允许，我有资格代表母亲们坚决地提出抗议！”

    许多军属写信给自己的儿子，嘱咐他们学好本领，握紧手中的枪杆，警惕地保卫祖国，随时准备打击一切侵略者。福建和浙江一带的妇女们提出，我们时刻都不会忘记美军还霸占着我国的领土台湾，我们要更加紧张地生产，要尽一切力量来协助中国人民解放军打击美国侵略者的挑衅。北京市棉纺织联合厂的女工们，最近专门开展了“支援阿拉伯人民斗争周”的运动。南宁市有的工厂女工发起了“每人做一件事支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争”的运动，女工们在这个运动中普遍突破了生产定额。各地妇女们都表示，做母亲的最酷爱和平，然而解放了的中国妇女也决不害怕战争。云南省有十多个少数民族的妇女最近在昆明举行了抗议集会，来自边疆的傣族妇女在会上揭露了美军当年在傣族地区的种种罪行，她们说，我们傣族妇女坚决和全国人民一道，支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
