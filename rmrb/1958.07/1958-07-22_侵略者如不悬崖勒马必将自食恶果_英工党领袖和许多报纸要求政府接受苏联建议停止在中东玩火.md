Xinhua News Agency, London, July 20th: British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell said today that he very much hoped Macmillan would accept Khrushchev's invitation to meet in Geneva on Tuesday. He said, "This is an opportunity that absolutely cannot be missed. This opportunity could stop the drift towards war and begin trying to achieve some kind of settlement in the Middle East."

Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Aneurin Bevan, said:
	"In the current international situation, Khrushchev's invitation is of paramount importance. We should certainly accept it."

Labour's economic affairs spokesman, Harold Wilson, also called for the immediate and unhesitating acceptance of the Soviet proposal.

Liberal Party leader Jo Grimond also expressed hope that the government would accept the Soviet proposal.

Today's "Reynolds News" said in an editorial that if the Soviet invitation is not accepted immediately, "the West's already weak moral position will be greatly reduced."

The "Sunday Observer" also said: "If Britain and the United States now ignore or simply reject Khrushchev's invitation, they will bear a heavy responsibility. The wiser course is to try to meet as quickly as possible."

Meanwhile, Bevan published an article in today's "News of the World," pointing out that the real reason for the American intervention in the Middle East was not the situation in Lebanon but the revolution in Iraq. Bevan accused the United States and Britain of "deciding to support two governments that are clearly ruling against the wishes of their own people."

Bevan believes: "There has scarcely been an example in British history of such reckless action so contrary to our long-term fundamental interests."

He demanded: "It is absolutely necessary to stop this madness in midsummer before we ourselves reach the point of no return."

"The Observer" pointed out that, as in Suez, Anglo-American intervention in Jordan and Lebanon is "an action moving in the wrong direction" and is a "muddled and dangerous" action.

The newspaper believes that the revolution in Iraq, the civil war in Lebanon, and the long-term instability in Jordan "are all the result of a bankrupt policy that makes Western governments rely on governments that no longer have the support of their people and can only be maintained by force."

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 20th: The "Victory for Socialism" group, composed of left-wing members of the British Labour Party, held a protest rally here tonight against the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Middle Eastern countries.

The conference passed a resolution demanding recognition of the Republic of Iraq and acceptance of the Soviet proposal to hold an immediate five-nation summit.

The resolution will be submitted to British Prime Minister Macmillan, British Labour Party leader Gaitskell, and the U.S. Ambassador to London.

Labour MP Zilliacus told an audience of 1,000 that accepting Khrushchev's invitation "may be the last chance for the U.S. and British governments to end their intervention in the Middle East, which is a violation of the (United Nations) Charter, before they face the terrible choice of either accepting defeat and humiliation or dragging the world into war."

He said that if the United States and Britain do not immediately accept the Soviet invitation but obstruct, create difficulties, and raise irrelevant issues for this meeting, they will be regarded by the world and their own people as war criminals and enemies of civilization.

He believes that British Prime Minister Macmillan is "very bellicose and (his words) are coated with seductive sugar." He said: "He (Macmillan) is a threat to peace. Moreover, he is completely subservient to Mr. Dulles, who has repeatedly boasted of bringing the world to the brink of war."

Another Labour MP, Sydney Silverman, said, "The actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East are reckless, irresponsible, and criminally stupid." He said, "This action further weakens the authority of the United Nations and brings the world much closer to disaster."

Dr. Soper said that what the United States and Britain have done in Lebanon and Jordan is morally wrong. He also believes that Khrushchev's proposal to hold a summit should be accepted. He said, "It is better to lose face and save life than to save face and lose life." Conference Chairman Swaffer announced at the meeting that a "Stop the War" movement committee has been established to coordinate the actions of various organizations and individuals opposing "military intervention."

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 21st: Many British newspapers today advocated accepting the Soviet proposal to hold an immediate summit.

"The Daily Worker" warned: "The British people are being dragged into a reckless and dangerous adventure." The newspaper also said: "Britain's real policy should be to support the withdrawal of all imperialist troops and strive to hold a summit and reach an agreement on the Middle East issue."

The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" believes that the Soviet proposal provides a way to achieve peace. The newspaper said: "The proposal to hold an immediate summit was made again by Mr. Khrushchev."

"The News Chronicle" believes that if the West rejects the Soviet proposal, then millions of people will regard Western leaders as mistaken people or conspirators.

"The Manchester Guardian" also believes that the Soviet proposal should be accepted immediately. "The Irish Times" pointed out that the Soviet proposal "has genuine sincerity."

However, some newspapers, while believing that the Soviet proposal should not be rejected outright, do not really want to eliminate the danger of war in the Middle East, but only to deceive public opinion. These newspapers also offer suggestions to enable the West to use false pretexts to delay and refuse to hold a summit.

For example, "The Times," on the one hand, believes that "an outright rejection, or an attempt to mask rejection with meaningless hypocritical words and empty counter-proposals" is the worst response, because this would "deepen the suspicion of some countries in continental Europe towards Anglo-American intervention, and confirm the doubts of neutralist Asian public opinion." On the other hand, it emphasizes that there must be "more preparatory work" and advocates "probing" the Soviet Union.

The most conservative "Daily Telegraph" also holds the same position. It has to admit that "an outright rejection" would not be an appropriate response, because this would "only deepen" the impression that "Britain and the United States are rushing headlong and rashly into a war of aggression." Therefore, the newspaper advocates using the so-called "situation in the Middle East is still being handled by the United Nations" as an excuse to reject the Soviet proposal.

    侵略者如不悬崖勒马必将自食恶果
    英工党领袖和许多报纸要求政府接受苏联建议停止在中东玩火
    新华社伦敦20日电  英国工党领袖盖次克尔今天说，他很希望麦克米伦将接受赫鲁晓夫要他星期二到日内瓦开会的邀请。他说：“这是一个绝对不能错过的机会。这个机会可以制止走向战争和开始设法在中东取得某种解决。”
    工党外交问题发言人比万说：
  “在目前的国际形势下，赫鲁晓夫的邀请具有头等重要的意义。我们当然应该接受。”
    工党经济问题发言人威尔逊也要求立即不犹豫地接受苏联的建议。
    自由党领袖格里蒙德也表示希望政府接受苏联的建议。
    今天的“雷诺新闻”在社论中说：如果不立即接受苏联的邀请，“西方在道义上已经很弱的地位将会大大降低。”
    “星期日观察家周报”也说：“如果英国和美国现在不理睬或者干脆拒绝赫鲁晓夫的邀请的话，它们将要负很重的责任。比较明智的办法是尽可能快地设法开会。”
    同时，比万在今天的“世界新闻报”上发表文章，指出，导致美国干涉中东的真正原因并不是黎巴嫩的局势而是伊拉克的革命。比万指责美国和英国“决定支持两个显然是违反他们自己人民的愿望执政的政府”。
    比万认为：“在英国的历史上简直还没有过如此冒失的和如此违反我们长期的基本利益的行动的例子”。
    他要求：“在我们自己还没有到快要不能回头的地步的时候，在仲夏停止这种疯狂行为是绝对必要的”。
      “观察家报”指出，像在苏伊士一样，英美对约旦和黎巴嫩的干涉是“一种走向错误方向的行动”，是“糊涂的、危险的”行动。
    这家报纸认为，伊拉克的革命、黎巴嫩的内战和约旦的长期动荡局势“都是破产了的政策的结果，这种政策使西方政府依靠那些不再得到它们人民的支持和只有用武力才能维持的政府”。
    新华社伦敦20日电  由英国工党左翼人士组成的“争取社会主义胜利”集团今天晚间在这里举行反对美英武装干涉中东国家的抗议大会。
    大会通过了一项决议，要求承认伊拉克共和国，要求接受苏联提出的立即举行五国最高级会议的建议。
    这项决议将提交给英国首相麦克米伦、英国工党领袖盖次克尔以及美国驻伦敦大使。
    工党议员齐里亚库斯在会上对一千名听众说，接受赫鲁晓夫的邀请“可能是美英两国政府在面临着或者是接受失败和耻辱，或者是把世界拖进战争这个可怕的抉择之前结束它们对中东的干涉的最后机会，这种干涉是违反（联合国）宪章的”。
    他说，如果美国和英国不立即接受苏联的邀请而是对这次会谈进行阻挠，制造困难和提出不相干的问题，它们将被全世界和本国人民看作战犯和文明的敌人。
    他认为，英国首相麦克米伦“非常好战而（他的话）又包上了哄人的糖衣”。他说：“他（麦克米伦）是和平的威胁。此外，他完全屈从于杜勒斯先生，杜勒斯先生曾经一再吹嘘要把世界带到战争边缘。”
    另一位工党议员锡尔弗曼说，“美英在中东的行动是轻率的、不负责任的、罪恶的愚蠢行为。”他说，“这种行动进一步削弱了联合国的权力，使世界大大地接近灾难”。
    索佩尔博士说，美英在黎巴嫩和约旦所干的事情从道义上讲是错误的。他也认为应当接受赫鲁晓夫提出的举行最高级会议的建议。他说，“失掉面子而保全生命要比保全面子而失掉生命好得多。”大会主席斯文格勒在会上宣布说：已经成立“停止战争”运动委员会来协调反对“军事干涉”的各个组织和个人的行动。
    新华社伦敦21日电  很多英国报纸今天主张接受苏联提出的立即举行最高级会议的建议。
    “工人日报”警告说：“英国人民正在被拖进轻率的和危险的冒险中。”报纸又说：“英国真正的政策应当是支持撤出一切帝国主义军队，努力使最高级会议得以举行并且就中东问题达成协议。”
    工党的“每日先驱报”认为苏联的建议提供了导致和平的办法。这家报纸说：“主张立即举行最高级会议的建议又是由赫鲁晓夫先生提出的。”
    “新闻纪事报”认为，如果西方拒绝苏联的建议，那么，千百万人民就会把西方的领袖们看作是犯错误的人或者是阴谋家”。
      “曼彻斯特卫报”也认为应该立刻接受苏联的建议。“爱尔兰时报”指出，苏联的建议“有真正的诚意”。
    但是，也有一些报纸虽然认为不应该断然拒绝苏联的建议，却并不是真想消除在中东的战争危险，而只是为了欺骗舆论。这些报纸还出谋献计，使西方得以用虚伪的借口来拖延和拒绝举行最高级会议。
    例如，“泰晤士报”一方面认为，“断然拒绝，或者企图用毫无意义的虚伪的词句和空洞的反建议来掩饰拒绝的态度”是最坏的答复”，因为这样欧洲大陆上的某些国家对英美干涉所抱的怀疑“就会加深，而中立主义的亚洲舆论所抱的疑虑就会得到证实”。另一方面它又强调必须有“更多的准备工作”，主张对苏联进行“试探”。
    最保守的“每日电讯报”也抱同样的立场。它不得不承认，“断然拒绝”不会是合适的答复，因为这样“只会加深”人们对于“英美急急忙忙、冒冒失失地投入侵略战争的印象”。因此，这家报纸主张用所谓“中东局势仍然在联合国处理中”这一类话作为借口，来回绝苏联的建议。
