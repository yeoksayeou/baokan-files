Warrior's Poems

Davis is a lesson from the past
My name is Silver Swallow,
I fought in the Korean War;
The "Sabre" panicked when it saw me,
The "Lightning" trailed white smoke from its tail.
When the Middle East war started, the robbers acted up again,
Silver Swallow got angry when it heard this,
Warning the old American and British scoundrels;
Davis' fate is a lesson for you!
        (Air Force Warrior Jiang Xanzhi)

Mountain, Wake Up and Take a Look
Mountain, mountain,
You slumber on the shores of the motherland,
Wake up and take a look:
The motherland is leaping forward,
Heading towards a more beautiful tomorrow.
Mountain, mountain,
You slumber on the shores of the motherland,
Wake up and take a look:
The American imperialists' ambitions are not dead,
They still want to destroy humanity's happiness and safety.
Mountain, mountain,
Wake up and take a look,
The coastal defense warriors' enthusiasm soars to the sky,
In order to turn the border into an impregnable fortress, we dedicate all our youth to the motherland.
            (Warrior Guo Sili)

One Hundred Li March at Night
The sun sets, leaving the barracks,
Thousands of troops march busily,
Backpacks on, guns in hand,
Shovels and picks on shoulders,
Crossing rivers and climbing mountains,
Sweating profusely, singing loudly.
The wind whispers, the fog is vast,
No mountain is too high to stop us,
Supporting agriculture by building reservoirs,
Marching one hundred li at night to the battlefield.
              (Warrior Zhang Xu)

Practicing Bayonet Drills
The hot sun hangs in the sky,
Soldiers practice bayonet drills on the training ground,
Bayonet skills must be mastered,
Show your skill in close combat.
            (Second Lieutenant Tan Daoan)

Hearts Linked Together Like Trees with Shared Roots
Hearts linked together,
Revolutionary feelings deeper than the sea,
Comrades are my dear brothers,
The leaders are my confidants.
          (Warrior Han Xueming)

Old Veteran
Battalion Chief of Staff,
Truly an old veteran.
Striking mountain rocks with an iron hammer,
Every strike is steady.
The hammer falls accurately and powerfully,
Every strike shakes the mountain,
Swinging the hammer hundreds of times,
Without a hint of tiredness.
              (Warrior Zhang Xu)

### 战士的诗

专栏：战士的诗

    战士的诗戴维斯是前车之鉴我的名字叫银燕，抗美援朝作过战；
  “佩刀式”见了吓破胆，
  “闪电式”碰上屁股冒白烟。
  中东战火起，强盗又作乱，银燕一听生了气，警告美英老混蛋；戴维斯的下场，就是你们的前车鉴！
        （空军战士　蒋先志）高山，你醒来看看
  高山高山，
  你沉睡在祖国的海边，
  你醒来看看：
  祖国在飞跃向前，
  奔向更美好的明天。
  高山高山，
  你沉睡在祖国的海边，
  你醒来看看：
  美帝的野心不死，
  还想毁灭人类的幸福、安全。
  高山高山，
  你快醒来看看呵，
  海防战士的干劲冲天，
  为了把边疆变成铜墙铁壁，我们把全部青春向祖国贡献。
            （战士　郭思礼）夜行百里奔战场太阳西沉离营房，千军万马行军忙，背起背包拿起枪，铁锹洋镐肩上扛，越过河沟翻山岭，汗流满身歌声响。风飒飒，雾茫茫，大山再高难阻挡，支援农业修水库，夜行百里奔战场。
              （战士　张序）
    练刺杀火热的太阳天空挂，士兵操场练刺杀，刺杀技术要学精，白刃格斗显本领。
            （少尉　谭道安）
    心连心树连根来心连心，革命感情比海深，同志们是我亲兄弟，首长是我知心人。
          （战士　韩学铭）
  老健将二营参谋长，真是老健将。铁锤击山石，锤锤都稳当。落锤准又狠，锤锤震山岗，抡了百把锤，不喊累的慌。
              （战士　张序）
