    New Developments in the Big-Character Poster Movement
    -- Introducing the Experience of Happiness Cooperative in Promoting Work Using Big-Character Posters
    Luo Keming, First Secretary of the CPC Gaoyao Prefectural Committee of Guangdong

    "Big-character posters are an extremely useful new type of weapon... which has been universally used and should be used forever." How to implement Chairman Mao's instruction, to use big-character posters forever, to elevate big-character posters from a general tool for airing views and making suggestions to a tool for debate centered on the production tasks and work tasks of each period, one upsurge following another, to be used forever, and to become a powerful weapon for the Party to conduct lively political and ideological work among the broad masses of cadres and people, and to continuously promote the smooth progress of production and various tasks? On this issue, the Happiness Cooperative of Sihui County has provided preliminary but quite beneficial experience in this regard.
                    (I)
    The Sihui Happiness Cooperative, once praised as the "village of big-character posters," in May of this year, closely combined with current production, focusing on eliminating the three categories of inferior rice, organized and mobilized the masses to use big-character posters to conduct repeated airing of views and debates, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all cooperative members, and after eliminating all 308 mu of three categories of inferior rice (of which 276 mu were transformed into first-class rice), profoundly educated cooperative cadres and members, making them realize the power of big-character posters in actual work, and truly believe that big-character posters are an extremely useful new type of weapon. The idea of some cadres being afraid of big-character posters was shattered without being attacked. Big-character posters have initially created a relatively lively political situation in the cooperative. The political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of all cooperative members have rapidly increased, and the face of the cooperative's production work has also been completely renewed. After the production movement was promoted through big-character posters, the Party branch and cooperative committee of the cooperative further focused on important production activities such as late-rice sowing, fertilizer accumulation, and summer harvest, using big-character posters to systematically organize the struggle between advanced and backward thinking, establishing the two opposing sides of advanced and backward, using the method of organizing a major debate to solve an ideological problem and promote a work, to continuously improve the masses' level of consciousness, and organize mass production movements; to keep the broad masses constantly full of enthusiasm and vigorous fighting spirit, and to victoriously complete various production tasks one after another. When the fertilizer accumulation movement was launched in late May, when the cooperative committee proposed accumulating 1,500 dan of fertilizer per mu, 40% of the cooperative members had some resistance to the questions of whether so much fertilizer was needed, whether there was a fertilizer source, and how to deliver the fertilizer to the fields. The cooperative committee immediately seized a women's youth shock team named "Hua Mulan," which accumulated 760 dan per person per day, as an advanced banner, and Wu Xueqi, a backward typical who was dissatisfied with fertilizer accumulation and got up in the middle of the night to sprinkle broken glass on the vegetable garden, attempting to obstruct the development of the fertilizer accumulation movement, and launched a month-long movement of "learning from Hua Mulan and criticizing Wu Xueqi's thinking" throughout the cooperative, combined with holding a fertilizer exhibition displaying various fertilizer sources and fertilizer production methods, mobilizing all cooperative members to discuss, posting more than 3,000 big-character posters to commend the Hua Mulan team and criticize Wu Xueqi, and making suggestions for the fertilizer accumulation movement, thereby quickly resolving the masses' various erroneous understandings of the fertilizer accumulation movement, and launching a fertilizer accumulation upsurge within two days, and soon overfulfilling the task of accumulating 1,500 dan of fertilizer per mu for the late rice. At the beginning of the summer harvest work, in order to implement careful harvesting and careful threshing, the cooperative's inspection team found that the loss of grain was most serious during the field inspection and evaluation, with more than ten kilograms of grain being lost per mu. At the same time, Wu Jincai's contracted team, which discarded bundles of rice ears in the field, and Liu Baoxia's team, which conscientiously implemented careful harvesting and careful threshing, were found as two different typical examples, and the masses were immediately mobilized to post more than 2,200 big-character posters discussing rushing to harvest, rushing to cut, careful harvesting, and careful threshing in the airing-of-views garden and the field propaganda shed, combined with holding a field physical exhibition. At present, the entire cooperative is enthusiastically carrying out this ideological and technical debate of great significance to promote the smooth progress of the summer harvest and summer planting.
                        (II)
    The Happiness Cooperative's good at closely combining with the production work of each period, using big-character posters combined with evaluation and inspection, physical exhibitions, systematically establishing opposing sides, organizing the struggle between the advanced and the backward, to solve the masses' ideological problems, quickly improve the masses' consciousness, promote advanced technologies, and organize the masses' revolutionary actions, is the most rapid, effective, and lively method of mobilizing the masses, developing democracy, realizing that things are discussed with the masses, establishing a clear banner, using points to lead the whole, relying on the advanced, leading the backward, and using the masses' self-education method to conduct regular political and ideological work among the masses, and is a new development in the use of big-character posters. Like a red thread, it embodies the principles of politics as the commander, correctly handling contradictions among the people, combining the general with the specific, and combining leadership with the masses, into various practical works.
    Regarding any issue, especially a new thing, everyone has their own views, ideas, and practices. Using big-character posters combined with inspection, evaluation, and physical exhibitions can fully expose and concentrate these different views, ideas, and practices, and solve various ideological problems one by one through debates on typical ideas. In this way, the masses' ideological consciousness and political level can be gradually improved with the progress of various works and the development of production work, so that the Party's political and ideological work for the people is lively, focused, and continuous, and the principle of "politics as the commander" and "political work first before military action" is implemented in actual work, and the Party's leading role in the political and ideological work of the people is fully exerted.
    Around each work and each movement, using big-character posters combined with evaluation and visits to conduct airing of views and debates can truly ensure that each work goes through a process of repeated consultation with the masses; using persuasion, education, and comparison methods to improve the middle, win over the backward, and correctly handle the contradictions between the advanced and the backward among the people. From the process of objective things development, discovering the two opposing sides of advanced and backward, highlighting them, and carrying out lively discussions with clear contrasts between good and bad examples, this can promote the advanced, rely on the advanced ideas and figures to improve those who are still in the middle in ideology and work, encourage them to move forward rapidly, and persuade and transform backward ideas and figures. This method of setting up opposing sides, grasping both ends and driving the middle, is the principle of combining the general with the specific, and combining leadership with the masses, which is the application of materialist dialectics in actual work. Through this working method, various production targets and measures can be thoroughly implemented, becoming the voluntary and conscious revolutionary actions of millions of people, and powerfully promoting and ensuring the rapid completion of various work tasks. This can avoid the simple practice of simply conveying various work tasks, production targets, and measures from top to bottom through administrative orders, and can save time and achieve immediate results most quickly, thereby solving the phenomenon that various targets and measures are still staying among cadres, staying in meetings and speeches, and cannot be fully implemented, which seriously exists in many places at present, and can also solve the problem of how to use the mass line to carry out work during the busy farming season. At the same time, it can further dispel the concerns and erroneous thoughts of some cadres who are afraid to discuss problems with the masses (fearing that the masses will not pass it and fail to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities), and cannot discuss with the masses (fearing that the time will be prolonged and affect the completion of tasks on schedule), or think that there is no need to discuss with the masses (thinking that the masses will not have better ideas or methods). Thus, in actual work, we should further implement the mass line, develop socialist democracy, and gradually establish a new style of communism.
                (III)
    Big-character posters are like a gust of wind, the airing-of-views upsurge comes, big-character posters rise like a storm, and once the upsurge is over, big-character posters stagnate: this has been, and still is, a troubling and difficult problem encountered in many places. The Happiness Cooperative's method of organizing a big-character poster upsurge around each important link in the current production work points out a way to realize the regularization of big-character posters. The key is to elevate the weapon of big-character posters from generally mobilizing the masses to air their views, from generally commending and criticizing the work achievements, advantages, and disadvantages of cadres, and from the general mutual criticism and self-criticism among the masses, to consciously and purposefully organizing the struggle between the advanced and the backward according to each different work, using the method of grasping both ends and driving the middle, to conduct political and ideological education for the broad masses, continuously improving the people's consciousness, and powerfully promoting the progress of various works. In this way, the role of big-character posters can be further exerted, so that big-character posters can continuously advance with the development of production movements and various works, one upsurge following another, becoming a regular and sharp weapon that is loved and used freely by the broad masses of cadres and people, sufficient to develop socialist democracy and conduct self-education.
    At present, our work is in a very tense and busy stage of summer harvest and summer planting. Quickly learning and promoting the experience of the Happiness Cooperative in using big-character posters to mobilize the masses and promote work, seizing the current work links of rushing to harvest, rushing to cut, careful harvesting and careful threshing, deep plowing, transforming backward fields, making and delivering fertilizer, early transplanting and close planting, improving labor efficiency, tool reform, distribution policy, etc., using field big-character posters combined with field physical exhibitions, field evaluations, competition for suggestions, etc., establishing typical examples, organizing the struggle between the advanced and the backward, to further mobilize the masses, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, quickly promote advanced technologies, and thoroughly implement the summer harvest and summer planting production increase measures, is a decisive link in completing the summer harvest and summer planting tasks on schedule victoriously.
    The experience of the Happiness Cooperative proves that when the work is more difficult and more tense, big-character posters can show the power of mobilizing the masses and overcoming difficulties. In the current very tense summer harvest and summer planting struggle, we must consciously use big-character posters and fully exert the role of big-character posters. Enable the broad masses of cadres and people to experience the sweetness of big-character posters in actual struggle and learn to use the new type of weapon of big-character posters.
    Everyone believes in big-character posters, and everyone will use big-character posters, and our work will definitely be done better. We should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and use big-character posters forever. Long live big-character posters!

    大字报运动的新发展
    ——介绍幸福社运用大字报推动工作的经验
    中共广东高要地委第一书记  罗克明
    “大字报是一种极其有用的新式武器……已经普遍使用起来了的，应当永远使用下去”。如何贯彻执行毛主席这个指示，将大字报永远的使用下去，将大字报作为从一般的鸣放、提意见的工具，提高到围绕着各个时期的生产任务和工作任务进行辩论，一个高潮紧接着一个高潮地永远使用下去，成为党对广大干部和群众经常地进行生动活泼的政治思想工作、不断地推动生产和各项工作顺利进行的有力武器？对于这个问题，四会县幸福社在这方面提供了初步的，但是颇为有益的经验。
                    （一）
    曾被人们誉为“大字报的村庄”的四会幸福社，在今年5月间，从密切的结合当前生产，围绕着消灭三类禾为中心，组织发动群众运用大字报形式，进行反复的鸣放辩论，调动全体社员积极性，将三百零八亩三类禾全部消灭之后（其中二百七十六亩变为一类禾），深刻的教育了社干和社员，使他们在实际工作中体会了大字报的威力，确实相信了大字报是一种极其有用的新式武器。一些干部怕大字报的思想不攻自破了。大字报已经使社里初步出现了一个较为生动活泼的政治局面。全体社员的政治积极性和生产积极性迅速高涨，社的生产工作面貌也焕然一新。通过大字报把生产运动推动起来以后，该社的党支部和社委会，更进一步地围绕着晚造播种积肥、夏收等重要生产活动，运用大字报有领导、有系统地去组织先进思想和落后思想的斗争，树立先进和落后的两个对立面，用组织一次大辩论，解决一个思想问题，推动一个工作的办法来不断地提高群众的觉悟程度，组织群众性的生产运动；使广大群众经常保持着饱满的热情、旺盛的斗志，一个接着一个胜利地去完成各种生产任务。5月下旬开展积肥运动时，社委提出每亩积肥一千五百担的时候，全社有40％的社员对是否需要积那么多的肥料，是否有肥源与如何送肥到田等问题都存在着一些抵触思想，社委会即抓住一个以“花木兰”命名的每人日积七百六十担的妇女青年突击组这个先进的旗帜，和一个对积肥不满、半夜起来把碎玻璃撒在菜园地子里，企图阻挠积肥运动开展的伍学琦这个落后的典型，在全社开展了一个为时一月的“学习花木兰，批判伍学琦思想”的运动，结合举办一个展出各种肥源及制肥方法的肥料展览会，发动全体社员讨论，贴出三千多张大字报表扬花木兰队和批评伍学琦，并对积肥运动进行献计，从而迅速地解决了群众对积肥运动的各种错误认识，势如破竹地在两天之内掀起了积肥高潮，不久便超额完成了晚造每亩积肥一千五百担的任务。在夏收工作开始的时候，为了贯彻执行细收细打，该社检查组在田间检查评比时，发现了丢落谷粒最严重，每亩丢掉谷子十几斤。与此同时，又发现了成扎的谷穗丢在田上的伍金才包产组和认真执行细收细打的刘宝霞小组两个不同的典型，随即发动群众在鸣放园地和田间宣传棚里贴出了二千二百多张讨论抢收抢割、细收细打的大字报，并结合举行田头实物展览。目前全社正在热烈进行着这一场具有十分重要意义的思想上的和技术上的辩论，以推动夏收夏种的顺利进行。
                        （二）
    幸福社善于密切结合各个时期的生产工作，运用大字报结合评比检查、实物展览，有领导、有系统地树立对立面，组织先进与落后两个对立面的斗争，以解决群众的思想问题，迅速提高群众的觉悟，推广先进技术，组织群众的革命行动的作法，是放手发动群众，发扬民主，实现有事和群众商量，树立鲜明的旗帜，以点带面，依靠先进，带动落后，用群众自我教育的方法向群众进行经常性的政治思想工作的最迅速有效和最生动活泼的办法，是运用大字报形式的新发展。它像一根红线一样，将政治是统帅，正确处理人民内部矛盾，一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合等群众路线的原则，贯彻到各项实际工作中去。
    对待任何一个问题，尤其是对待一个新鲜事物，每个人都有他一定的看法、想法和做法。运用大字报结合检查评比，实物展览，就可以将这些不同的看法、想法、做法充分暴露，集中起来，通过典型思想的辩论，将各种思想问题一个一个地加以解决。这样，就可以使得群众的思想觉悟、政治水平，随着各项工作的进行，随着生产工作的发展步步提高，使党对人民群众的政治思想工作既生动活泼、集中突出，又能经常不断地进行，在实际工作中贯彻执行了“政治是统帅”“兵马要动，政治先行”的原则，充分发挥党对人民群众在政治思想上的领导作用。
    围绕着每一项工作，每一个运动，运用大字报结合评比、参观来进行鸣放、辩论，就能够真正做到使每一项工作都经过一个和群众反复商量的过程；用说服教育、对比的办法来提高中间、争取落后、正确处理人民内部先进和落后之间的矛盾。从客观事物发展的过程中，发现先进和落后的两个对立面，把它突出起来，以好坏事例的鲜明对照来开展生动活泼的讨论，这样就可以推广先进，依靠先进的思想、人物来提高在思想上、工作上还处于中间状态的人们，鼓励他们迅速前进，并说服和改造落后的思想和人物。这种设置对立面，抓两头带动中间的办法，是一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合的原则，也就是唯物辩证法在实际工作中的运用。通过这种工作方法，就可以把各种生产指标、措施贯彻到底，成为千百万群众自愿自觉的革命行动，有力地推动和保证各项工作任务的迅速完成。既可以避免单纯地将各种工作任务，生产指标，措施由上而下往下贯的光靠行政命令的简单做法，又能节省时间，最迅速地收到立竿见影的效果，从而可以解决当前不少地方严重存在着的各种指标、措施仍然停留在干部中间，停留在会议、口头上，不能全部贯彻到底的现象，也可以解决了如何在农忙期间运用群众路线去进行工作的问题。同时可以进一步的解除某些干部所存在着的有问题不敢交群众讨论（怕群众通不过完不成上级任务）、和不能交群众讨论（怕时间拖长影响依期完成任务）或认为不需要交群众讨论（认为群众不会有更好的意见办法）等顾虑和错误思想。从而在实际工作中进一步的贯彻执行群众路线，发展社会主义的民主，逐步建立起共产主义的新风格。
                （三）
    大字报一阵风，鸣放高潮一来，大字报风起云涌，高潮一过，大字报就停滞不前：这曾经是、而且目前仍然是不少地方所碰到的一个令人苦恼而又难以解决的问题。幸福社善于围绕着当前生产工作中的每一个重要环节去组织大字报高潮的办法，为实现大字报经常化这个问题指出了一条道路。它的关键是将大字报这个武器从一般地发动群众鸣放，从一般地表扬批评干部的工作成绩、优点和缺点，从群众之间一般地进行相互的批评和自我批评的阶段，提高到有意识、有领导地根据每一个不同的工作去组织先进和落后的斗争，用抓两头带动中间的办法，对广大群众进行政治、思想上的教育，不断地提高人民群众的觉悟，有力地推动各项工作进行的阶段。这样，就能进一步发挥大字报的作用，使大字报随着生产运动与各项工作的开展，一个高潮紧接着一个高潮地不断前进，成为广大干部群众所喜闻乐见，运用自如，足以发扬社会主义民主，进行自我教育的经常性的锐利武器。
    目前，我们的工作正处在十分紧张繁忙的夏收夏种阶段，迅速学习推广幸福社运用大字报发动群众，推动工作的经验，抓住当前抢收抢割细收细打、深耕、改造落后田，制肥送肥、早插密植、提高劳动效率、工具改革、分配政策等等工作环节，运用田头大字报结合田头实物展览、田间评比、竞赛献计等办法，树立典型，组织先进和落后的斗争，以进一步发动群众，克服右倾保守思想，迅速推广先进技术，将夏收夏种的增产措施贯彻到底，这是胜利地依期完成夏收夏种任务的一个决定性的环节。
    幸福社的经验证明，当工作越是困难，越是紧张的时候，大字报越能显示出发动群众，克服困难的威力，在当前十分紧张的夏收夏种斗争中，必须有意识地运用大字报，充分发挥大字报的作用。使广大干部、群众在实际斗争中体会到大字报的甜头，学会使用大字报这个新式武器。
    人人相信大字报，人人会用大字报，我们的工作就一定会做得更好一些。我们应当遵循着毛主席的指示，将大字报永远使用下去。大字报万岁！
