Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd – Scientific workers in Shenyang City, on the eve of "July 1st," are dedicating 1,240 scientific research achievements to the Party's birthday. Many of these scientific research achievements have reached international levels or are top-notch domestically. The scientific research personnel of the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have presented the Party with sixty-one scientific research achievements, including "nickel-free stainless steel." All countries in the world use a lot of nickel to refine stainless steel. Our research into using nickel-free refining of stainless steel can save a lot of nickel. Nickel-free stainless steel has good corrosion resistance. Currently, the world's best chrome-magnesia bricks have a service life of 340 furnaces. The aluminum-magnesia bricks successfully researched by the Institute of Metal Research in cooperation with Ansteel have been proven by industrial experiments to have a lifespan of over 520 furnaces.

The Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Institute of Chemical Industry, after successfully trial-producing raw materials for capron synthetic fibers, has also successfully researched terylene and polyethylene, which are superior to capron. Terylene is durable for clothing and has electrical insulation and heat resistance properties. Polyethylene has a wide range of uses and can be used in the mechanical and electrical industries. It can withstand high and low temperatures, can replace steel for water pipes, can be used for silk reeling to make artificial fibers, and can also be made into beautiful furniture.

    沈阳市科学工作者
    以一千多项科学成果向党献礼
    新华社沈阳2日电　沈阳市科学工作者在“七一”前夕，以一千二百四十项科学研究成果向党的生日献礼。其中许多项科学研究成果已经达到国际水平或国内第一流水平。中国科学院金属研究所的科学研究人员向党献的礼物中，有“不用镍不锈钢”等六十一项科学研究成果。世界各国炼不锈钢都要用很多镍，我国研究不用镍炼不锈钢，就可以节省很多镍。不用镍炼的不锈钢抗腐蚀性能良好。现在世界各国认为最好的铬镁砖，使用寿命是三百四十炉，金属研究所和鞍钢合作研究成功的铝镁砖，经工业实验证明，寿命达到五百二十炉以上。
    北京化工研究院沈阳分院继卡普龙合成纤维原料试制成功以后，又研究成功了优于卡普龙的特丽伦、聚乙烯。特丽伦做衣服经穿耐用，而且具有电绝缘作用和耐热性能，聚乙烯用处广，可以用于机械工业和电气工业，它能耐高低温，可以代替钢材做水管，可以缫丝做人造纤维，还可以做成美丽的家具。
