Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 7th. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recently decided to transfer 5,000 Party cadres to higher and secondary schools to take on administrative and political-ideological work. This decision was announced by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, at the Shanxi Provincial Education Work Conference.

The cadres transferred to the schools possess a relatively high level of political and ideological understanding and practical struggle experience. After a month or so of intensive study, they will take up their new posts, assuming administrative leadership roles and engaging in political and ideological education work in various schools.

Currently, political and ideological work in various types of schools at all levels in Shanxi Province remains a relatively weak link in school operations. There are few Party and Communist Youth League cadres in schools, making it impossible to regularly conduct political and ideological work at the grassroots level of departments, sections, and classes. In order to implement the fundamental policy of education serving politics, combining education with labor, and developing education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee, in addition to deciding to transfer 5,000 Party cadres to strengthen the Party's leadership on the cultural and educational front, will also take practical measures to strengthen political education work in schools at all levels, and help teachers and students establish a Marxist class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and a materialist and dialectical viewpoint.

    山西加强文教战线党的领导
    五千名党员干部将担任学校行政领导和政治工作
    新华社太原7日电  中共山西省委最近决定抽调五千名党员干部到高等和中等学校担任行政工作和政治思想工作。这个决定是中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳在山西省教育工作会议上宣布的。
    调往学校的这批干部具有较高的政治思想水平和实际斗争的经验。他们将经过一个月左右的集中学习后，走上新的工作岗位，分别担任各个学校的行政领导工作和政治思想教育工作。
    目前，山西省各级各类学校的政治思想工作仍然是学校工作比较薄弱的一个环节。学校党、团干部少，不能经常深入系科、班级基层中进行政治思想工作。中共山西省委为了贯彻教育为政治服务，教育和劳动相结合，多快好省地发展教育事业的根本方针，在决定抽调五千名党员干部加强文教战线党的领导力量以外，还要采取切实的措施加强各级学校的政治教育工作，帮助教师和学生树立起马克思主义的阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点、唯物论和辩证法的观点。
