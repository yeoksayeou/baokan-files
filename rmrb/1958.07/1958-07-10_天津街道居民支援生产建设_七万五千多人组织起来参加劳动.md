Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 8th: In the past month, over 75,000 family members of workers and neighborhood residents in Tianjin have left their homes and joined socialist construction, the majority of whom are housewives. They have been organized to perform processing work for factories and handicraft cooperatives, participate in road construction, street cleaning, and other labor. Furthermore, they have established thousands of daily necessities supply stations, savings service stations, nurseries, kindergartens, as well as service organizations such as canteens, shower facilities, hot water supply stations, and noodle processing.

Since the beginning of this year, Tianjin's industry and commerce have developed rapidly, and the labor force cannot meet the needs. Factories and enterprises have been giving full play to the production enthusiasm of their workers in various ways, improving labor efficiency, and recently cooperating with local street offices and residents' committees to mobilize workers' family members and residents to support production.

Workers' family members and neighborhood residents are all very excited about being able to participate in socialist construction. Residents of Shenzhuangzi Street proposed over 100 ways to the street office in one afternoon to organize participation in production, contacted more than 80 factories and handicraft cooperatives in seven or eight days, and established 20 production and processing groups. In just five or six days, Xiawafang Street organized more than 500 residents to do processing work for five factories and handicraft cooperatives. The daily necessities supply service stations run by residents of Dawangzhuang Street have reached 33.

The processing work done by workers' family members and neighborhood residents for factories and handicraft cooperatives ranges from extremely simple tasks like pasting paper boxes, winding thread, and nailing fly swatters, to weaving carpets, sewing, processing screws, cast iron, and forging iron. They undertake whatever they can do and whatever factories and handicraft cooperatives need. After many factories and handicraft cooperatives handed over some simple tasks to workers' family members and residents, they freed up manpower to invest in the production of important processes, thus greatly increasing production without adding factory buildings, machinery and equipment, or formal workers. For example, after the joint state-private United Underwear Factory organized more than 150 sewing machines from residents to do sewing processing for the factory, the factory's production efficiency increased by nearly doubled.

    天津街道居民支援生产建设
    七万五千多人组织起来参加劳动
    新华社天津8日电  在最近一个月中，天津市有七万五千多名职工家属和街道居民走出家庭，参加了社会主义建设，其中大部分是家庭妇女。她们组织起来为工厂、手工业社作加工活，参加修筑道路、清扫街道等劳动，而且还建立了数以千计的生活日用品供应站、储蓄服务站、托儿所、幼儿班以及食堂、淋浴站、热水供应站、切面加工等服务组织。
    今年以来，天津市工商业飞速发展，劳动力不能满足需要。各工厂、企业多方面地发挥职工的生产积极性，提高劳动效率，最近又和当地街道办事处、居民委员会合作，发动职工家属和居民支援生产。
    职工家属和街道居民对自己能参加社会主义建设都感到非常振奋。沈庄子街居民在一个下午就向街办事处提出了一百多项组织起来参加生产的门路，七、八天里就联系了八十多个工厂、手工业社，建立了二十个生产加工组。下瓦房街仅五、六天就组织了五百多个居民为五个工厂和手工业社作加工活。大王庄街居民举办的生活日用品供应服务站已达三十三个。
    职工家属和街道居民为工厂、手工业社作的加工活，从极简单的糊纸盒、打线、钉苍蝇拍，直到织地毯、缝纫、加工螺丝钉、铸铁、锻铁等，凡是他们能作而工厂、手工业社又需要的，他们就承应。许多工厂、手工业社把一部分简单的活交给职工家属和居民们做以后，就腾出人力投入了重要工序的生产，因而在不增添厂房、机器设备和正式工人的情况下大大提高了生产。如公私合营联合内衣厂组织居民的一百五十多台缝纫机为厂里作缝纫加工后，厂里的生产效率提高将近一倍。
