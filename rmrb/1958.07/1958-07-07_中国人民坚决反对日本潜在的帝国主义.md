The Japanese general election is over, and Nobusuke Kishi, relying on the majority of the Liberal Democratic Party in the Diet, has once again taken office as Prime Minister of Japan, forming the Second Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. This cabinet is the most reactionary cabinet in Japan since its surrender in 1945. It represents the interests of the most aggressive Japanese monopoly capitalists who are deeply colluded with the United States. In his policy speech, Kishi Nobusuke plagiarized a large number of democratic and peaceful words, but he could not conceal his continued pursuit of the United States, his continued creation of "two Chinas," his firm hostility towards the Chinese people, his active economic expansion into Southeast Asia, his conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism, and his suppression of the Japanese people. The foreign and domestic policies of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet fully reflect the latent imperialist ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capital group, and seriously illustrate that Japan is being further dragged onto the old path of militarism and imperialism. Faced with this trend that threatens peace in Asia and the world, we cannot but maintain a high degree of vigilance.

Whether to take the road of independence and peace or the road of militarism and imperialism is the main struggle in Japan since the end of World War II, and it is also a matter of deep concern to the people of all countries who have suffered from the long-term aggression of Japanese militarism, especially the Chinese people. As early as February 1955, when Japan held its sixth post-war House of Representatives election, this newspaper clearly pointed out in its editorial "The Japanese People Face Two Roads": "The Japanese people are facing two distinctly different roads. One road is to strive for independence and peace. This means getting rid of the state of being semi-occupied by the United States, gaining an independent and autonomous position, preventing the revival of militarism, and making due contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is in line with the general trend of the Japanese political situation after the fall of the Yoshida government. The other road is to retrace the old path of the Yoshida government. This means openly or covertly being willing to be a vassal of the United States, reviving Japanese militarism, increasingly falling into the quagmire of the US's aggressive policy of 'using Asians to fight Asians,' and endangering peace in Asia and the world. This is contrary to the current political trend in Japan." At that time, we warned the Japanese militarists: The former road is welcomed by the people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people, but if some people in Japan still want to retrace the old path of the Yoshida government, willingly be with Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and act as a tool of the US aggressive policy, they will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the broad masses of the Asian people, especially the Japanese people. In the past few years, the Japanese people have extensively launched struggles for peace, independence, and democracy, and have powerfully attacked various conspiracies to revive Japanese militarism. The powerful Sino-Soviet alliance and the forces of peace-loving people in Asian countries have also played a huge role in preventing the resurgence of Japanese militarism.

Starting from the lofty goal of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people once hoped that the Japanese ruling group could learn from the bitter defeat of World War II, get rid of the control of the US war forces, and take the road of peace and independence that is beneficial to peace in Asia and beneficial to the Japanese people. The Chinese people have always given the greatest sympathy and active support to the Japanese people's struggle to strive for peace and independence, demand friendship with the Chinese people, and demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. In the past eight years, although the state of war between China and Japan has not ended, the Chinese people, in the spirit of not dwelling on the past, have done their best to assist Japanese residents who are willing to return to Japan, leniently handled Japanese war criminals, warmly received a large number of Japanese people from all walks of life who came to China to visit, and directly dealt with a series of issues related to common interests with Japanese civil organizations. This magnanimous and benevolent approach of the Chinese people has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people and some insightful people in the Japanese ruling group.

However, the Japanese monopoly capital group and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which represent the interests of this group, not only have no remorse for the heinous crimes of invading China in the past, but also follow the United States and adopt a hostile attitude towards China, actively carrying out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and doing their best to hinder the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. They regard the goodwill of the Chinese people as deceivable, and regard the Chinese people's desire to develop Sino-Japanese trade on the basis of equality and friendship as a manifestation that the Chinese people must rely on Japan in the process of building socialism. Under the strong pressure of the Japanese people's demand for friendship with the Chinese people and for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the Japanese monopoly capital group and the Kishi Nobusuke government have adopted a double-dealing approach. On the one hand, they have gained political capital and trade benefits from the friendly exchanges between the Japanese and Chinese people and strengthened their bargaining power with the United States. On the other hand, they arrogantly believe from an imperialist point of view that even if they are hostile to and insult the Chinese people, China must still deal with and trade with Japan. Therefore, they can confidently regard China as an object of Japan's economic expansion. The Kishi Nobusuke government's tearing up of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and condoning Japanese thugs to insult our national flag in Nagasaki are concrete manifestations of this double-dealing approach, and also expose the latent imperialist face of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to drag Japan back onto the old road of imperialism is by no means accidental. Japan is a country with a highly developed capitalism. Although it suffered a defeat in World War II, lost its colonies, and is under the control of the United States, the monopoly capital that dominates Japan has been preserved by the United States. The United States intends to revive Japanese militarism through Japanese monopoly capital and make Japan a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia. The Japanese monopoly capital hopes to gain the support of the United States by serving the US aggressive policy, thereby accumulating strength and making a comeback. In the Korean War, Japan played the role of a logistics base for the US invading army, which further developed Japanese monopoly capital. This cannot but strengthen the imperialist desires of the Japanese monopoly capital group to try to dominate the Far East again.

Historical facts have long proven that relying on the brutal exploitation of the people at home, relying on economic expansion abroad, and relying on aggression and war are the characteristics of the development of Japanese monopoly capital. The economy developed on such a basis is not only extremely unstable in itself, but also inevitably leads to aggression against other countries and even causes war. Japanese monopoly capital took advantage of the windfall profits made in the Korean War to massively expand Japan's industrial productive forces, causing Japan's industrial output to rise for a time. However, this rising scene reached its peak in July 1957. Since then, it has begun to decline. By February of this year, Japan's industrial and mining output had fallen by 13% compared with July of last year. The inventory of industrial and mining products began to increase from May of last year, and by February of this year, it had increased by 45% compared with April of last year. The number of fully unemployed people in Japan has increased from 480,000 in July of last year to 850,000 in March of this year, that is to say, it has increased by 77%. At present, the operating rates of some major Japanese industries such as steel ingots, thick steel plates, automobiles, cotton yarn, papermaking, and rayon have been reduced by 20% to 50% compared with the planned plan. These situations show that Japan has begun to enter the ranks of the economic crisis in the capitalist world led by the United States. This is also the background for the establishment of the Second Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. In order to get rid of and shift the crisis, the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to strengthen the export of goods and capital to Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Near East, and Central and South America, and re-launch the struggle to seize overseas markets. Because Japan itself is very short of funds, Japanese monopoly capital has also put forward the so-called Southeast Asia development plan to establish a new "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" with US funds, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources. The Second Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet has stated that it will make the greatest efforts to realize this economic expansion plan.

In order to serve the US aggressive policy, Japanese monopoly capital is politically stepping up preparations for the Northeast Asia anti-communist military alliance instigated by the United States, consisting of Kishi Nobusuke, Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Ngo Dinh Diem, and others. The current negotiations between Japan and South Korea are directly related to this conspiracy plan. Sawada Renzo, the chief Japanese representative participating in this negotiation, publicly said in Tokyo on June 11 that pushing the 38th parallel back to the Yalu River is the task of Japanese diplomacy. This remark fully exposes the Japanese monopoly capital's preparation to take the old road of aggression and war. In the military field, Japan's current armed forces already far exceed the German armed forces before Hitler came to power. With the support of the United States, Japan has imported equipment capable of launching and carrying atomic weapons. Japan's military industry has been completely restored, and its potential is even greater than before the war. The United States has established a network of military bases in Japan, which can be used for US atomic warfare at any time. In domestic affairs, Japanese monopoly capital is preparing to take a series of measures to revive Japanese militarism, such as the small constituency system, which provides conditions for amending the constitution and expanding armaments, and is preparing to suppress and persecute the Japanese people who insist on taking the road of peace, independence, and democracy.

It is obvious that the Japanese monopoly capital group, with its latent militarist ambitions and imperialist desires, is not only dragging Japan into the abyss of disaster with the support of the United States, but also poses a serious threat to Asian countries. Considering the vital interests of the Chinese and Japanese people, and considering the interests of peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese people believe that it is their responsibility to thoroughly expose the essence of the Kishi Nobusuke government from its policy of hostility towards China. Doing so is not only not excessive, but absolutely necessary and timely; it will not only not exacerbate international tensions, but is precisely to ease international tensions.

The prospect of the Kishi Nobusuke government dragging Japan onto the old road of imperialism is not wonderful. Judging from the overall international situation, today is an era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. The development of socialism in the world is like the rising sun, while imperialism is already declining. If, twenty years ago, when socialism had only achieved victory in one country and imperialism was still able to run rampant for a while, the Japanese imperialists' dream of dominating Asia had not been realized, then today, when socialism has become a world system and has gained an overwhelming advantage over imperialism, Japanese militarists should not even think about reliving the old dream of imperialism. At the same time, the national independence movement is booming in Asia and Africa. The countries of Asia and Africa have suffered from imperialist aggression, and many of them still have vivid memories of Japanese imperialist aggression. They are determined to strive for and maintain their national independence, and can count on the friendly cooperation of socialist countries. Therefore, they will never allow the Japanese monopoly capital group to re-invade them in any new way. The Kishi Nobusuke government places great hope on the support of the United States. Recently, in order to ask for instructions and curry favor with its US masters, Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to "reflect on the Nagasaki incident" as a gesture to bargain with the United States. However, the purpose of the United States in supporting Japanese militarists has always been to make Japan a vassal and tool of the US aggressive policy, rather than to make Japan a competitor with the United States for the market. Moreover, the United States, which is currently deeply mired in the economic crisis, is not only unable to take care of itself, but is also eager to shift the crisis to other capitalist countries, including Japan. Looking at the domestic situation in Japan again, the forces in the Japanese people who oppose US control, demand independence and democracy, and advocate peace and neutrality have increasingly become an undeniable political force. In the recent two general elections in Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party has failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required to amend the constitution in the Diet. This shows that the Japanese people are opposed to the revival of militarism and opposed to taking the old road of imperialism.

The general trend of the development of the international situation and the domestic situation in Japan cannot be reversed by the Japanese monopoly capital group and the Kishi Nobusuke government no matter what. Going against this general trend and trying to drag Japan onto the old road of militarism and imperialism is a self-destructive approach. Adapting to the general trend of world development, abandoning imperialist attempts, and implementing peaceful coexistence and economic cooperation with Asian and African countries in accordance with the principles adopted by the Bandung Conference is a wise approach. Where to go is an important choice facing the Kishi Nobusuke government.

As far as Sino-Japanese relations are concerned, the Chinese people's attitude is very clear. The Chinese people have always expressed friendship towards the Japanese people. However, the Chinese people firmly oppose the latent imperialist ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capital group and the Kishi Nobusuke government. The Chinese people who have stood up are building socialism with overwhelming momentum and soaring enthusiasm, and are fully confident of surpassing the industrialized capitalist countries in a very short period of time. If China and Japan establish normal relations on the basis of equality and friendship, coexist peacefully, and carry out exchanges in all aspects, this will not only conform to the wishes and interests of the Chinese and Japanese people, but also conform to the interests of peace in Asia and the world. However, if the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to be hostile to the Chinese people, continues to create "two Chinas," and continues to hinder the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, then the responsibility for the complete interruption of Sino-Japanese exchanges should be borne entirely by the Kishi Nobusuke government. We firmly believe that the Japanese people's struggle for Sino-Japanese friendship and for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, just like their struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, will surely overcome all obstacles and difficulties and achieve the final victory. The Chinese people will do their best to unswervingly support this just struggle of the Japanese people.

### 中国人民坚决反对日本潜在的帝国主义

    中国人民坚决反对日本潜在的帝国主义
    日本大选以后，岸信介依恃自由民主党在国会中的多数，再一次出任日本首相，组成了第二次岸信介内阁。这一内阁，是日本自1945年投降以来最反动的内阁，它集中地代表了同美国勾结较深、最富于侵略性的日本垄断资本巨头的利益。岸信介在他的施政方针演说里，虽然剽窃了大批民主和平的字句，但是掩盖不了他继续追随美国、继续制造“两个中国”、坚决与中国人民为敌、积极向东南亚进行经济扩张、阴谋复活日本军国主义和镇压日本人民的一系列对外、对内政策。岸信介内阁的对外、对内政策，充分地反映了日本垄断资本集团潜在的帝国主义野心，严重地说明了日本正在进一步被拖上军国主义和帝国主义的老路。面对着这种威胁亚洲和世界和平的趋势，我们不能不保持高度的警惕。
    走独立和平的道路，还是走军国主义和帝国主义的道路，这是第二次世界大战结束以来日本国内的主要斗争，同时也是遭受过日本军国主义长期侵略的各国人民，特别是中国人民，所深切关怀的问题。早在1955年2月日本举行战后第六次众议院选举的时候，本报在“日本人民面临着两条道路”的社论中就明确地指出：“日本人民正面临着两条截然不同的道路。一条道路是争取独立和平的道路。这就是摆脱处于美国半占领下的状态、取得独立自主的地位、防止军国主义的复活、在维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中作出应有的贡献的道路。这是符合于吉田政府倒台后日本政治形势的总的趋向的。另一条道路是重走吉田政府的老路。这就是公开地或隐蔽地甘心作美国的附庸、复活日本军国主义、日益陷入美国‘用亚洲人打亚洲人’的侵略政策的泥坑、危害亚洲和世界和平的道路。这是和日本当前政治趋势背道而驰的。”当时我们就向日本军国主义分子提出警告说：前一条道路是亚洲各国人民、尤其是中国人民所欢迎的，但是，如果日本仍然有人想重走吉田政府的老路，甘心与李承晚、蒋介石为伍，充当美国侵略政策的工具，那就必然会遭到亚洲广大人民首先是日本人民的坚决反对。几年来，日本人民广泛地展开了争取和平、独立、民主的斗争，有力地打击了复活日本军国主义的种种阴谋。强大的中苏同盟和亚洲各国爱好和平的人民的力量，对于防止日本军国主义的再起，也发挥了巨大的作用。
    从保卫亚洲和世界和平的崇高目的出发，中国人民曾希望日本统治集团能够从第二次世界大战的惨败中吸取教训，摆脱美国战争势力的控制，走有利于亚洲和平、有利于日本人民的和平、独立的道路。对于日本人民争取和平和独立、要求同中国人民友好、要求恢复中日邦交的斗争，中国人民一贯给予最大的同情和积极的支持。过去八年来，尽管中国和日本之间的战争状态并没有结束，但是，中国人民本着不咎既往的精神，尽力协助愿意返回日本的日侨回国，宽大处理日本战争犯罪分子，友好地接待了大批来华访问的日本各界人士，并且同日本民间团体直接处理了一系列有关共同利益的问题。中国人民的这种宽大为怀、仁至义尽的作法，得到了日本广大人民和日本统治集团中一部分有识之士的热烈欢迎。
    但是，日本的垄断资本集团和代表这个集团利益的岸信介政府，不但对过去侵略中国的滔天罪行毫无悔悟，反而追随着美国，对中国采取敌视的态度，积极进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，竭力阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复。他们把中国人民的善意看作是可欺，把中国人民愿意在平等、友好的基础上发展中日贸易的愿望，看作是中国人民在建设社会主义过程中必须依赖日本的表现。在日本人民要求同中国人民友好、要求恢复中日邦交的强大压力下，日本垄断资本集团和岸信介政府采取了两面三刀的作法。一方面，他们从日本人民和中国人民的友好往来中捞取政治资本和贸易实惠，加强对美国的讨价还价。另一方面，他们从帝国主义的观点出发，狂妄地认为即使对中国人民敌视和侮辱，中国也非同日本来往和进行贸易不可。因此可以有把握地把中国看作是日本经济扩张的对象。岸信介政府一手撕毁第四次中日贸易协定和纵容日本暴徒在长崎侮辱我国国旗，正是这种两面三刀作法的具体表现，同时也暴露了岸信介政府的潜在的帝国主义面貌。
    岸信介政府力图把日本重新拖上帝国主义的老路，决不是偶然的。日本是一个资本主义高度发展的国家，在第二次世界大战中虽然遭到了挫败，丧失了殖民地，并且处于美国的控制之下，但是，在日本占统治地位的垄断资本却被美国保存下来。美国的意图是通过日本垄断资本，复活日本军国主义，使日本成为美国在亚洲进行侵略的工具。而日本垄断资本却希望通过为美国侵略政策的服务，得到美国的扶持，从而积累力量，东山再起。在朝鲜战争中，日本起了美国侵朝军队的后勤基地的作用，使日本垄断资本得到了进一步的发展。这就不能不加强了日本垄断资本集团企图重新称霸远东的帝国主义欲望。
    历史事实早已证明，依靠对国内人民的野蛮剥削、依靠在国外的经济扩张、依靠侵略和战争，这是日本垄断资本发展的特点。在这样的基础上发展起来的经济，不仅本身是极端不稳定的，而且必然会导致对别国的侵略，甚至引起战争。日本垄断资本利用了在朝鲜战争中发的横财，大规模地扩充了日本工业的生产力，使日本工业产量一度上升。但是，这种上升的景象到1957年7月已经达到了顶峰。从那时以后便开始下降。到今年2月，日本的工矿业产量比去年7月下降了13％。工矿业产品的库存量从去年5月起开始增加，到今年2月，比去年4月增加了45％。日本的完全失业者，已经由去年7月的四十八万人增加到今年3月的八十五万人，也就是说，增加了77％。目前，日本某些主要工业如钢锭、厚钢板、汽车、棉纱、造纸、人造丝等的开工率，已经比预定计划减少20％到50％。这些情况说明日本已经开始步入了由美国带头的资本主义世界的经济危机的行列。这也正是第二次岸信介内阁成立的背景。为了摆脱和转嫁危机，岸信介政府准备加强对东南亚、中近东和中南美等地区的商品输出和资本输出，重新展开夺取海外市场的斗争。由于日本本身的资金非常缺乏，日本垄断资本又提出了用美国的资金、日本的技术、东南亚的资源来建立新的“大东亚共荣圈”的所谓东南亚开发计划。第二次岸信介内阁已经表示要为实现这个经济扩张计划作出最大的努力。
    为了替美国的侵略政策服务，日本垄断资本在政治上正加紧筹划美国授意的、由岸信介、蒋介石、李承晚、吴庭艳等组成的东北亚反共军事联盟。目前日本和南朝鲜正在进行的谈判就是同这个阴谋计划直接有关的。参加这个谈判的日方首席代表泽田廉三，6月11日在东京公开说，把三八线推回到鸭绿江边，是日本外交的任务。这一谈话充分暴露了日本垄断资本准备走侵略和战争的老路。在军事上，日本目前拥有的武装力量已经远远超过希特勒上台前的德国武装力量。在美国的支持下，日本已经运进了能够发射和载运原子武器的装备。日本的军事工业已经完全复原，潜力甚至比战前还大。美国在日本已经建立起军事基地网，可以随时为美国的原子战争备用。在内政上，日本垄断资本正准备采取为修改宪法、扩张军备提供条件的小选举区制度和一系列复活日本军国主义的措施，并且准备对坚持走和平、独立、民主道路的日本人民进行镇压和迫害。
    很明显，具有潜在的军国主义野心和帝国主义欲望的日本垄断资本集团，在美国的扶持下，不仅正在把日本拖入灾难的深渊，而且也是对亚洲各国的一个严重的威胁。中国人民，考虑到中日两国人民的切身利益，考虑到亚洲和世界和平的利益，认为有责任从岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，彻底揭露这个政府的本质。这样做，不仅不是过火，而且是绝对必要和适时的；不仅不会加剧国际紧张局势，而且正是为了和缓国际紧张局势。
    岸信介政府把日本拖上帝国主义老路的前景是并不美妙的。从整个国际形势来看，今天正是东风压倒西风的时代。社会主义在全世界的发展正如旭日东升，而帝国主义却已经日薄西山。如果说，二十年前，当社会主义只是在一个国家取得胜利，帝国主义还能够猖獗一时的时候，日本帝国主义独霸亚洲的迷梦都没有能够得逞，那么，今天，当社会主义已经成为一个世界体系，并且取得了压倒帝国主义的优势的时候，日本军国主义分子更休想重温帝国主义的旧梦。同时，民族独立运动正在亚非两洲蓬勃高涨。亚非各国饱受帝国主义的侵略，其中有许多国家对日本帝国主义的侵略记忆犹新，它们坚决争取和维护自己的民族独立，并且能够指望社会主义国家的友好合作，因此，决不会容许日本垄断资本集团以任何新的方式重新对它们进行侵略。岸信介政府对于美国的扶持，寄予极大的希望。岸信介最近为要向美国主子请示和讨好，曾表示要“反省长崎事件”，来作为对美讨价还价的姿态。但是，美国扶持日本军国主义分子的目的，从来就是为了使日本成为美国侵略政策的附庸和工具，而不是使日本成为同美国争夺市场的对手。何况，目前深深陷入经济危机的美国，不仅自顾不暇，而且急于向其他资本主义国家，包括日本在内，转嫁危机。再从日本国内的形势来看，日本人民中反对美国控制、要求独立民主、主张和平中立的势力已经日益成为不可忽视的政治力量。在日本最近的两次大选中，自由民主党都没有能够在国会中取得修改宪法所必需的三分之二多数。这就说明，日本人民是反对复活军国主义、反对走帝国主义老路的。
    国际形势和日本国内形势的总的发展趋向，是日本垄断资本集团和岸信介政府无论如何也扭转不了的。违背这个总的发展趋向，硬要把日本拖上军国主义和帝国主义的老路，这是自寻绝路的作法。适应世界总的发展趋向，放弃帝国主义的企图，按照万隆会议所通过的原则，同亚非国家实行和平共处和经济合作，这是明智的作法。究竟何去何从，这是摆在岸信介政府面前的一个重要的抉择。
    就中日关系来说，中国人民的态度是非常明确的。中国人民对于日本人民始终表示友好。但是，中国人民坚决反对日本垄断资本集团和岸信介政府的潜在的帝国主义野心。站起来了的中国人民正在以排山倒海的气概和冲天的干劲建设社会主义，并且完全有把握在很短的时间之内，超过工业发达的资本主义国家。如果中日两国在平等和友好的基础上，建立正常关系，和平共处，开展各方面的往来，这不仅符合于中日两国人民的愿望和利益，也符合于亚洲和世界和平的利益。但是，如果岸信介政府继续敌视中国人民，继续制造“两个中国”，继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，那么，中日来往全面中断的责任，应该全部由岸信介政府担负。我们深信，日本人民争取中日友好、争取中日关系正常化的斗争，正像他们争取和平、独立、民主的斗争一样，一定能够排除一切障碍和困难，获得最后的胜利。中国人民将竭尽全力、始终不渝地支持日本人民的这种正义斗争。
