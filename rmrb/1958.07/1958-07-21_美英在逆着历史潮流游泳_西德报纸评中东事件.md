US and Britain Swimming Against the Tide of History
West German Newspapers Comment on Middle East Events

    In recent days, many major bourgeois newspapers in West Germany have expressed dissatisfaction in their commentaries regarding the US and British aggression in the Middle East, and at the same time, expressed concern about the serious consequences that these acts of aggression may cause.

    The Hamburg "Die Welt" believes that the US and British "war actions are a regrettable adventure;" they are "opposing a powerful national movement." "Dulles and Lloyd are swimming against the tide of history."

    美英在逆着历史潮流游泳
    西德报纸评中东事件
    连日来，西德许多主要资产阶级报纸在评论中对美英侵略中东的行为表示不满，同时也对这些侵略行为所可能引起的严重后果表示担忧。
    汉堡“世界报”认为，美英“两国的战争行动是一场可悲的冒险”；它们是在“反对一个强大的民族运动”。“杜勒斯和劳埃德是在逆着历史的潮流游泳。”
