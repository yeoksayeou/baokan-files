Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 15th: The delegation of the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League of Heilongjiang Province, led by Gu Chengyun, Secretary of the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, left Harbin by train on the evening of the 14th to visit Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League. The delegation consists of six people.

Komsomolsk-on-Amur is a modern city built by a group of older generation members of the Soviet Communist Youth League on the wilderness of the Amur River through arduous efforts. The Soviet female writer Vera Ketlinskaya’s novel "Courage" vividly describes the construction of this city. The achievements of the Soviet Communist Youth League members in building Komsomolsk-on-Amur have had a huge impact on the Communist Youth League members and youths in Heilongjiang Province, and they take the deeds of the builders of Komsomolsk-on-Amur as their model. This time, the Qiqihar City delegation will visit the first group of Communist Youth League members who came there to build the city, understand and learn about their achievements and experiences in building the cause of communism, and introduce to them the creative labor and achievements of 200,000 young people in Qiqihar City in building socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The delegation also brought some gifts from the young people of Qiqihar and hundreds of letters of greetings to the Communist Youth League members and youths of Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

    共青团齐齐哈尔市委代表团去苏联访问共青城
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　共青团黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市委员会代表团，应苏联共青团共青城委员会的邀请，在团长、共青团齐齐哈尔市委书记谷成云率领下，于14日晚间乘车离哈尔滨前往苏联共青城参观访问。代表团一行共六人。
    共青城是苏联一批老一辈的共青团员在黑龙江边的荒野上，经过艰苦努力建设起来的现代化城市。苏联女作家薇拉·凯特玲斯卡娅的长篇小说——“勇敢”，对这个城市的建设作过动人心弦的描写。苏联共青团员们建设共青城的业绩，在黑龙江省共青团员和青年中有巨大的影响，他们以共青城建设者的事迹作为自己的榜样。齐齐哈尔市的代表团这一次将要访问第一批来到那里建城的共青团员们，了解和学习他们在建设共产主义事业方面的成就和经验，并且向他们介绍齐齐哈尔市二十万青少年在中国共产党领导下，建设社会主义的创造性劳动和成就。这个代表团还把齐齐哈尔市青少年的一些礼物和数百封问候信，带给共青城的共青团员青年们。
