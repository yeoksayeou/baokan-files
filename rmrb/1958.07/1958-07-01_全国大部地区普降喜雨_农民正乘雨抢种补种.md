Xinhua News Agency, 30th - From 8:00 AM on June 25th to 2:00 PM on June 30th, welcome rain has fallen successively in the Sichuan Basin, the Huai River basin, the Yellow River basin, and Northeast China. This rainfall is extremely beneficial to the summer planting, seedling replenishment, and growth of crops such as cotton, spring wheat, corn, and soybeans in the aforementioned areas.

During these six days, heavy rainfall areas were mainly concentrated in: parts of central Sichuan, both banks of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, the Hongze Lake, the Weishan Lake, and the Bengbu triangle area, western Henan, and near Mount Tai in Shandong. The rainfall in these areas generally exceeded 50 millimeters. For example, Xuzhou in Jiangsu had 171 millimeters of rainfall, Nantong 162 millimeters, Nanjing 60 millimeters, Bengbu in Anhui 101 millimeters, Baofeng in Henan 104 millimeters, Suiping 83 millimeters, Xuchang 56 millimeters, and near Mount Tai in Shandong 278 millimeters, Tai'an 188 millimeters, and Heze 98 millimeters. Heavy rain areas included: central and southwestern Shandong, central Henan, northern Anhui, central and northern Jiangsu, northern Hebei, Beijing, the Changbai Mountains, and the Nen River basin. Rainfall in these areas generally exceeded 28 millimeters. The general rain area was very wide, such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, and most of Northeast China, with rainfall of about 10 to 15 millimeters.

Before this rain, the aforementioned areas showed varying degrees of drought. Some areas had not had a thorough rain for more than 200 days, and most areas had only sporadic rainfall since the beginning of spring. Especially recently, the temperature has been very high and evaporation large, with serious situations of riverbeds drying up, wells drying up, ditches drying up, and reservoirs drying up in the mountainous and hilly areas of some provinces. All 31 major rivers in the Laiyang Prefecture of Shandong were completely dry, and more than 50,000 of the 100,000 water wells were dry. The water level of the Yellow River also dropped sharply, and many siphons along the Yellow River could not draw water. Under the threat of such an unprecedented drought, Party and government leading organs at all levels organized farmers to fight the drought day and night with the spirit of "man will conquer nature," carrying out drought-resistant planting and rescuing many seedlings of rice, cotton, and spring crops that were about to die from drought. Finally, this rain has arrived. Now, farmers in vast areas are seizing the opportunity to plant and replenish seedlings, and strengthen crop management.

Currently, it is still raining in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The future rain area will move southeastward, and rain will fall in the Huai River basin, the upper reaches of the Han River, the Shandong Peninsula, and eastern Liaoning.

    全国大部地区普降喜雨
    农民正乘雨抢种补种
    新华社30日讯　从6月25日上午八时起，到30日下午二时止，四川盆地、淮河流域、黄河流域和东北各地，都先后普降喜雨。这一场雨，对上述地区的夏种、补苗和棉花、春小麦、玉米、大豆等作物的生长极为有利。
    这六天中，暴雨地区主要集中在：四川中部部分地区，江苏长江两岸，洪泽湖、微山湖和蚌埠三角地带，河南西部和山东泰山附近。这些地区降雨量一般都在五十公厘以上。例如，江苏徐州降雨量一百七十一公厘、南通一百六十二公厘、南京六十公厘，安徽蚌埠一百零一公厘，河南宝丰一百零四公厘、遂平八十三公厘、许昌五十六公厘，山东泰山附近二百七十八公厘、泰安一百八十八公厘、菏泽九十八公厘。大雨地区包括：山东中部和西南部，河南中部，安徽北部，江苏中部和北部，河北北部，北京，长白山和嫩江流域。这些地区降雨量一般都在二十八公厘以上。一般雨区范围很广，如陕西、山西、甘肃及东北大部地区都下了雨，降雨量约在十公厘到十五公厘之间。
    这场雨前，上述地区旱象呈现不同程度的严重情况。有些地区是二百多天未下过透雨，一般地区入春以来只零星下过雨。特别是最近以来，气温很高，蒸发量大，有些省的山区和丘陵区出现了河干、井干、沟干、水库干的严重情况。山东莱阳专区三十一条大河全部干涸，十万眼水井干涸五万多眼。黄河水位也急剧下降，沿黄河虹吸管有很多吸不出水来。在这样一种历史上少见的干旱威胁下，各地党政领导机关组织农民昼夜不断地同干旱进行艰苦斗争，以人定胜天的精神实行抗旱播种，抢救了许多快要旱死的禾苗、棉苗和春苗。终于接上了这一场雨。现在广大地区的农民，正在乘雨抢种、补种，加强作物的管理。
    目前，黄河中下游仍在下雨。未来雨区将向东南方移动，淮河流域、汉水上游、山东半岛及辽宁东部一带将要落雨。
