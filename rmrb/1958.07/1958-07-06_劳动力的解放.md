    The Liberation of Labor Power
    Yang Xuan
    These days, people on both sides of the street are talking about running industries. Sisters are all beaming with joy and feeling happy. Mother Wang was also moved by this trend, but her son advised her: "Mom, why bother! Why not enjoy a peaceful life at home and get involved in industrial production? You're so old, it's not like I can't support you. You should just stay at home and let me fulfill my filial duty."
    Mother Wang couldn't make up her mind for a while, so she came to me for advice. I said, "If you stay at home, you'll only be useful to your son. If you go out to engage in production, you'll be useful to more people." I have a basis for saying this. First, from the perspective of social needs, in order to accelerate socialist construction, the Party is calling on the whole people to run industries. Society will inevitably need more labor. Housewives are a large reserve labor force. Those who can participate in social production should actively participate. Second, from the perspective of housewives themselves, they also have this desire. Everyone has long wanted to step out of the family and dedicate themselves to society. In the past, they were dragged down by large and small household chores. Now, with the establishment of many street nurseries, canteens, and other services, the labor of housewives has been liberated from heavy housework, and it is possible to participate in social production. Third, from Mother Wang's own perspective, she was originally a working woman. Now she doesn't idle at home, busy doing this and that all day long, her hands and feet are quick, and she never rests. She has only one son, who is in his twenties, unmarried, and works in a commercial institution. When her son comes back, he is really comfortable. He opens his mouth for food, stretches out his hand for water, and everything he wears and uses is readily available, prepared by his mother. If you say Mother Wang is old, she is actually only forty-five years old, not some senile old woman. Moreover, because she likes to work, her body is as strong as an ox. It would be a pity not to fully utilize such good labor power.
    In my opinion, Mother Wang's son is not really trying to fulfill his filial duty, but is probably thinking about his own personal comfort. If he really wants to be filial, he should let Mother Wang step out of the house, give full play to her enthusiasm, and contribute more strength. As for housework, the son should also lend a hand. Besides, there are plenty of canteens, sewing groups, and laundry groups on the street now, which are very convenient.

    劳动力的解放
    杨萱
    这几天，街前街后，都在谈论办工业的事，姐姐妹妹，个个眉飞色舞，心情舒畅。王大娘也给这股风吹动了心，可是她儿子劝她：“娘，你这是何苦！放着家里安生日子不过，搞什么工业生产？你这么大年纪了，我又不是供养你不起。你还是什么地方也别去，在家好好耽着，叫我尽尽孝道。”
    王大娘一时委决不下，跑来要我出主意。我说：“你要是在家，只对你儿子一个人有作用。你要是出去搞生产，就会对更多的人有作用。”我说这话不是没根据的。第一，从社会需要来说，为了加速社会主义建设，党号召全民办工业，社会上势必需要更多劳动力，家庭妇女是一支很大的劳动后备军，能够参加社会生产的，都应该积极参加才是。第二，从家庭妇女本身来说，也有这种愿望，大家早就想走出家庭，献身社会，从前被大大小小的家务事拖着，现在办了许多街道托儿所、食堂、家庭妇女的劳动力就从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来了，就有可能参加社会生产。第三，从王大娘自己说，她原本是劳动妇女出身，现在在家也不闲着，整天干这干那，手勤脚快，从不歇着。她膝下单生一子，二十多岁，还没娶亲，在商业机关工作。儿子一回来，可真舒服，饭来张口，水来伸手，穿的用的，也一应俱全，大娘早给准备好了。若说大娘年纪大，其实也不过四十五岁，又不是七老八十的风烛残年。况且她因为喜欢劳动的关系，身子结实得像头牛似的。这样的好劳动力，不充分发挥出来，岂不可惜。
    我看，王大娘的儿子那是想尽什么孝道，恐怕倒是为个人舒服打算。真要尽孝道，就该让大娘走出家门，发挥她的积极性，贡献出更多力量来。家务事嘛，儿子自己也该动动手，况且现在街道上有的是食堂、缝纫组、洗衣组、方便得很。
