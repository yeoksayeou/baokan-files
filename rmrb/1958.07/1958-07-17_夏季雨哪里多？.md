Where Does Summer Rain Fall Most?
Lu Wuzhen

How is the rainfall situation in various regions of the country this summer? This is a question of concern to people across the nation. Summer rainfall is related to the bumper autumn harvest, socialist construction, and everyone's lives. However, it is not easy to give a correct answer to this question.

Summer is the rainy season in our country. Under normal circumstances, the rainfall from June to August in summer accounts for about 40% of the annual rainfall in the Yangtze River basin and its southern regions. The concentration of rainfall in the Huai River and regions north of the Qinling Mountains is more significant, generally accounting for more than 70% of the annual rainfall. The rain belt is initially in the Yangtze River basin in early summer, which is the so-called "plum rain" season. In mid-summer, it moves to the Yellow River basin and southern Northeast. Due to the impact of typhoons, another rain belt often appears in southern China, especially coastal areas, in July and August, thus forming a distribution pattern of more rain in the north and south and less rain in the south of the Yangtze River.

This June was somewhat different from previous years. Except for a few areas, the rainfall in most parts of the country in June was generally less than the average over the years. The plum rain in the Yangtze River basin hardly appeared. The rain belt in the Yangtze River basin often disappears or moves northward soon after it appears, unlike in normal years when it often stagnates in this region. In early July, the rain belt was mainly between the Yellow and Huai Rivers. The upper reaches of the Han River and western and northern Sichuan also had more rain. Most areas in the Yangtze River basin continued to have little rain. In the past few days, there has been widespread rainfall in North China, and the drought has been completely eliminated.

Because there is no mature and reliable method for long-term weather forecasting, it is difficult to say what will happen in the future. If we infer based on general conditions, the main areas with more rain in July should be southern Northeast, the Yellow River and Huai River basins, northern and western Sichuan, and the upper reaches of the Han River. These areas may still have relatively more rainfall in the second half of July. The plum rain season has passed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and north of the Nanling Mountains. Although there will be small-scale thunderstorms, the rainfall in the second half of July is estimated to remain low. The national rainfall distribution in August is roughly similar to that in July. However, a rain belt will appear along the coast of southern China, and the rainfall in this month may be slightly higher than in previous years. From these preliminary estimates, the Liao River, Hai River, Yellow River, Huai River, and Han River basins must pay attention to flood prevention, while the Jiangnan area still needs to vigorously fight drought.

    夏季雨哪里多？
    卢鋈
    今年夏季全国各地区的雨量情况怎样，这是全国人民关心的问题。因为夏季雨量，关系到秋季农业大丰收，关系到社会主义建设，也关系到每个人的生活。但是对这个问题，不大容易作出正确的回答。
    夏季是我国的雨季。从正常情况来说，夏季6月到8月的雨量，长江流域及其南地区，大致占全年雨量40％左右；淮河及秦岭以北地区雨量集中现象比较显著，一般约占全年雨量70％以上。多雨带初夏在长江流域，也就是所谓的“梅雨”；盛夏就移到黄河流域和东北南部。由于台风侵袭的影响，华南一带，特别是沿海地区，7、8月往往又有一个多雨带出现，因而形成南北多雨而江南比较少雨的分布形势。
    今年6月，和往年情况不太一样。除少数地区而外，全国6月雨量一般都比历年平均来得少，长江流域的梅雨几乎没有出现。长江流域的多雨带往往出现不久就消失或向北移去，不像一般年份那样经常停滞在这一地区。7月上旬多雨带主要在黄淮之间，汉水上游以及四川西部和北部也比较多雨。长江流域多数地区继续少雨。最近几天来华北地区普遍多雨，旱象已完全消除。
    因为气象长期预报现在还没有一个成熟可靠的方法，今后怎么样还很难说。如果根据一般情况来推断，7月多雨带，主要应在东北南部，黄淮流域，川北、川西以及汉水上游。这些地区7月下半月雨量可能还是比较多；长江中下游以至南岭以北，梅雨季已过，虽有小范围的雷阵雨，7月下半月雨量估计仍然不会多。8月全国雨量分布情况大致和7月相类似；不过华南沿海多雨带将出现，这一个月的雨量可能比往年还要稍多一些。从以上这些初步估计来看，辽河、海河、黄河、淮河以及汉水流域须注意防洪，江南地区则仍须大力抗旱。
