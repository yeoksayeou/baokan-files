Xinhua News Agency, London, July 19th: In order to protest against the American and British aggression in the Middle East, the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe announced here today that it would immediately cease all performances in London, effective today.

	Qu Wu, head of the song and dance troupe, stated at a press conference: The British government, based on absurd excuses it fabricated itself, has sent troops to Jordan to support the American troops' intervention in Lebanon. This is an open aggression against the Arab people and seriously endangers world peace.
	The entry of British troops into Jordan is a naked act of aggression. Jordan's affairs are the affairs of the Jordanian people themselves. The British dispatch of troops only means interfering in Jordan's internal affairs and attempting to attack the Republic of Iraq. This kind of action cannot be tolerated. The British government's aggression has not only met with resolute resistance from the people of Arab countries, but has also been resolutely opposed by peace-loving people all over the world.
	The statement pointed out that in the Chinese capital of Beijing, the broad masses held demonstrations to protest against American and British aggression and support the just struggle of the people of Arab countries. We are members of the People's Republic of China Opera and Dance Troupe performing in London, and we are in step with all the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world, and we are indignant at the British government's aggression. Therefore, we have decided to stop performing in Britain to express our anger and protest against the British government's aggression.
	The statement said, we believe that our just decision to stop performing in Britain will be fully understood and supported by the vast majority of our audience – the British people who uphold peace and justice. Please allow me to express our gratitude to all the friends who have cooperated well with us and to the audience who have warmly welcomed us. We also want to express our regret to those audiences who wanted to come and see our performances.
	We firmly believe that the Arab people will surely be able to defeat the American and British aggressors, and the forces of peace and justice will surely defeat the forces of war.

    抗议英国侵略中东
    我国歌舞团在伦敦停演
    新华社伦敦19日电  为了抗议美英对中东的侵略，中国戏曲歌舞团今天在这里宣布，从今天起立即停止在伦敦的一切演出。
    歌舞团团长屈武在记者招待会上发表声明说：英国政府根据自己制造的荒谬借口，已经派兵到约旦去支持美国军队对黎巴嫩的干涉。这是对阿拉伯人民的公开侵略，严重地危害了世界和平。
    英国军队进入约旦是一种赤裸裸的侵略行为。约旦的事务是约旦人民自己的事务。英国派遣军队只是意味着干涉约旦内政，并且企图进攻伊拉克共和国。这种行动决不能容忍。英国政府的侵略不仅遇到了阿拉伯各国人民的坚决抵抗，而且遭到了全世界爱好和平人们的坚决反对。
    声明指出，在中国首都北京，广大群众举行了示威，抗议美英侵略，支持阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争。我们是正在伦敦演出的中华人民共和国戏曲歌舞团成员，我们和中国全体人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的人们步调一致，对英国政府的侵略感到愤慨。因此，我们决定停止在英国演出，以表示我们的愤怒和抗议英国政府的侵略。
    声明说，我们相信，我们停止在英国的演出这一正义的决定将得到我们观众中的绝大多数——维护和平和正义的英国人民——的充分谅解和支持。请允许我向那些同我们进行良好合作的全体朋友以及非常热烈欢迎我们的观众们表示我们的感谢。我们还要向那些想前来观看我们演出的观众表示遗憾。
    我们深信，阿拉伯人民一定能够击败美英侵略者，和平和正义的力量一定能够战胜战争的力量。
