    Libya
    Libya is an Arab country located in North Africa. It is bordered by the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic to the east, Algeria and Tunisia to the west and northwest, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Its coastline stretches for 2,000 kilometers, and it has several excellent seaports, including the Port of Tobruk and the capital, Tripoli, which have military strategic importance. The country has a total area of more than 1.759 million square kilometers, two-thirds of which is desert. It has a population of more than one million, most of whom are Arabs, with Berbers and Black Africans in the west and south.
    Due to long-term imperialist plunder, Libya has been an economically backward agricultural country. Economic life is concentrated in the coastal areas and oases in the desert regions. Most residents are engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture. Industry consists only of some light industry and handicrafts. It is rich in various minerals, and the developed minerals have been seized by British and American capital. The people's living standards are very low, and illiteracy accounts for 90% of the population.
    Libya became a territory of the Roman Empire in the second century BC. From the seventh century AD, Arabs settled in Libya. In the early sixteenth century, Turkey conquered Libya and made it a province of the Ottoman Empire. When imperialism divided Africa in a robber-like manner in the nineteenth century, Italy defeated Turkey. Italy saw that Libya could be used to threaten Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia, and other places, and thus invaded Libya in 1912. During World War II, Britain occupied Libya and then made Libya its sphere of influence, refusing to withdraw its troops from Libya.
    Following closely, the claws of the United States also reached into Libya. As a result of negotiations between the United States and Britain, Britain disregarded its obligations under the Italo-British treaty and ceded the Mellaha Air Base in Libya to the United States in 1948. In addition, the United States has established air bases near Castel Benito and Benina. Tripoli, Benghazi, Tobruk and other places have also become US and British naval bases.
    The Libyan people have a glorious history of struggle against colonial rule. In 1916, the Libyan people's anti-imperialist struggle drove most of the Italian invading army into the sea, leaving the Italian army only able to occupy the city of Tripoli. After World War II, under the influence of the North African national liberation movement, their struggle for national independence became even stronger. They held large-scale demonstrations demanding that the British and American colonialists get out of Libya and unify Libya. In 1949, through the efforts of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, the Fourth UN General Assembly passed a resolution stipulating that Libya should convene a national conference before January 1, 1951, and establish a provisional government before April. Britain and France were required to hand over power to the Libyan government before January 1, 1952. After unremitting struggle, Libya finally gained independence on December 24, 1951. However, the British and American colonial forces did not completely withdraw from Libya. Not only did they continue to occupy many bases in Libya, but in 1954 they respectively forced Libya to conclude a military agreement, attempting to permanently occupy these bases as springboards for their aggression in North Africa and the Middle East.
    After Libya's independence, it joined the Arab League in 1953. In 1955, it was admitted as a member of the United Nations. Libya is a participant in the Asian-African Conference. The Libyan government has repeatedly stated that it will implement a neutral policy and strengthen cooperation with Arab countries. When the United Arab Republic was established in 1958, King Idris of Libya sent a telegram to express his congratulations. In May of this year, when Libyan Prime Minister Kabar replied to the Soviet government's letter on the cessation of atomic weapons testing, he expressed his support for the Soviet government's decision. However, Libya's independence and sovereignty are not complete, and its internal affairs are often subject to interference from American and British imperialism.
    Now, the British invading army has once again climbed onto Libyan soil like pirates in the nineteenth century, which is part of the British and American joint invasion of the Middle East's adventurous actions. (Mao Jin)

    利比亚
    利比亚是位于非洲北部的阿拉伯国家。东邻阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区，西部及西北部与阿尔及利亚及突尼斯相连，北临地中海，海岸线长达二千公里，有土布鲁克港和首都的黎波里等几个优良的海港，具有军事战略地位。全国面积共有一百七十五万九千多平方公里，其中有三分之二是沙漠地带。人口一百多万，其中大部分是阿拉伯人，西部和南部有柏伯尔人和非洲黑人。
    利比亚由于长期受到帝国主义掠夺，一直是经济落后的农业国。经济生活集中在沿海地带和沙漠地区的绿洲上。大多数居民都从事畜牧业和农业。工业仅有一些轻工业和手工业。富有各种矿藏，已开发的矿产都被英美资本所攫夺。人民的生活水平是非常低的，全国文盲占人口90％。
    利比亚在公元前二世纪曾沦为罗马帝国的领土。公元七世纪起，阿拉伯人在利比亚定居下来。十六世纪初，土耳其征服了利比亚，把利比亚作为奥斯曼帝国的行省。当十九世纪帝国主义用强盗的方式瓜分非洲的时候，意大利打败了土耳其。意大利看到利比亚可以用来威胁埃及、苏丹、突尼斯等地，便于1912年侵占了利比亚。在第二次世界大战中，英国占领了利比亚，随后就把利比亚作为其势力范围，一直不肯从利比亚撤出军队。
    紧跟着美国的魔爪也伸入了利比亚。美国和英国举行谈判结果，英国不顾违反对意和约条款的义务，于1948年将利比亚的麦拉哈空军基地让给美国。此外，美国又在开斯特鲁、班尼突附近建立了空军基地。的黎波里、班加西和托布卢克等地也变成了美英的海军基地。
    利比亚人民有着光荣的反抗殖民统治的斗争历史。1916年，利比亚人民的反帝斗争，曾把意大利大部分侵略军赶下了海，使意大利军队只能占领一个的黎波里城。第二次世界大战后，利比亚人民在北非民族解放运动的影响下，他们争取民族独立的斗争更加强烈了。他们曾举行大规模的示威，要求英美殖民者从利比亚滚出去，统一利比亚1949年，在苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的努力下，联大第四届大会通过了一项决议，规定利比亚应在1951年1月1日以前召开国民会议，4月以前成立临时政府，而英法则须在1952年1月1日以前将权力交给利比亚政府。经过不懈的斗争，利比亚终于在1951年12月24日获得了独立。但是英美殖民势力并没有全部从利比亚撤出，它们不但在利比亚继续占据着许多基地，而且在1954年分别强迫利比亚缔结一项军事协定，企图长期霸占这些基地，作为其侵略北非和中东的跳板。
    利比亚独立后，在1953年加入了阿拉伯联盟。1955年被接纳为联合国会员国。利比亚是亚非会议的参加国。利比亚政府曾一再表示要实行中立政策，加强同阿拉伯国家的合作。1958年阿拉伯联合共和国成立的时候，利比亚国王伊德里斯曾致电表示祝贺。今年5月间利比亚首相卡巴尔在答复苏联政府关于停止原子武器试验的信件时，表示支持苏联政府的决定。但是利比亚的独立和主权并不完整，它的内政经常受到美英帝国主义的干涉。
    现在，英国侵略军又像十九世纪的海盗一样重新爬上了利比亚国土，这是英国同美国联合侵略中东的冒险行动的一部分。  （茂金）
