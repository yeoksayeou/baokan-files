    Yunnan Builds Large Fertilizer Plant

    Xinhua News Agency: Yunnan Province's first mechanized and automated large-scale chemical fertilizer plant broke ground on the 1st.

    When the plant is fully completed in 1962, it will produce 100,000 tons of synthetic ammonium, 200,000 tons of high-efficiency superphosphate fertilizer, and 100,000 tons of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer, a new type of fertilizer. The entire province of Yunnan will be able to obtain approximately 20 kilograms of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, which can increase rice production in the province by 5.6 billion jin. Next year, it will first produce 200,000 tons of superphosphate and other fertilizers to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agriculture. (Attached picture)

    Amidst the great leap forward, the Beijing Thermal Power Plant project is progressing very rapidly. It is expected that the first generating unit will be able to generate electricity on August 1st of this year.

    云南办大化肥厂
    据新华社讯  云南省第一座机械化自动化的大型化学肥料厂在1日动工兴建。
    这个厂于1962年全部建成后，年产合成铵十万吨、高效化肥重过磷酸钙二十万吨和化肥中的新品种钙镁磷肥十万吨。云南全省平均每亩耕地可得化肥二十公斤左右，可使全省水稻增产五十六亿斤。明年将先行生产出过磷酸钙等二十万吨，以满足农业大跃进的需要。（附图片）
    在大跃进声中，北京热电站工程进展非常迅速。预计今年8月1日第一套机组即可发电。
