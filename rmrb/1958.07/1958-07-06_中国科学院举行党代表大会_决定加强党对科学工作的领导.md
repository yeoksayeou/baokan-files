Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: The Second Congress of Representatives of the CCP Organization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, held in Beijing from July 1st to 5th, demonstrated that the Party can and should lead not only scientific administration and scientific organization work, but also can and must lead scientific work itself. The 972 research achievements (107 of which reached or exceeded international standards) created by various institutes in Beijing recently to celebrate the Party's birthday and the Academy's Party Congress prove that science can only leap forward with the leadership of the Party.

The central theme of this congress was to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction in scientific work, give prominence to politics, and strengthen the Party's leadership over scientific undertakings. The participants unanimously agreed that only by strengthening the Party's leadership and giving prominence to politics can the Party's general line be implemented.

Yu Wen, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in his work report to the congress on behalf of the previous Party Committee that the main achievements of the Party's work in the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the three years since the first Party Congress were: organizing and consolidating the scientific ranks, preparing conditions for scientific work, carrying out scientific research work, training cadres, and achieving certain scientific research results; carrying out political and ideological socialist revolution, and clearing the way ideologically, organizationally, and practically for a more rapid and vigorous development of scientific work. The report pointed out: Before the rectification campaign, the main shortcomings in the Party's work in the Academy of Sciences were the weakness of political and ideological work, and the failure to clearly resolve some fundamental issues related to scientific work for a long time, mainly manifested in the failure to establish the Party's strong leadership in scientific work. During this rectification campaign, these shortcomings have been basically overcome.

Many representatives cited a large number of facts at the conference to prove that the leap forward in science must have the leadership of the Party; the Party can completely lead science. The representative of the Institute of Applied Physics introduced the experience of the leap forward in the semiconductor laboratory of the institute: first, the Party organization led everyone to put forward clear tasks. After the task was put forward, it led everyone to discuss the political significance of the task. When encountering difficulties and obstacles in the work, the Party led everyone to boost morale, examine their thinking, pull out white flags, and insert red flags, and the difficulties were easily solved. In the specific practice of research work, the Party organization also mobilized the masses to solve problems. For example, how to make a transistor, everyone put forward many plans, and after discussion, four methods were selected to complete one goal. When it was found that a certain method was proceeding best, fastest, and most promising in the work process, the Party organization mobilized forces to focus on key breakthroughs, unlike in the past, when a scientist found a method in foreign literature, had a flash of inspiration, and gave a young person a task, not to mention not talking about the significance of the work, but even in terms of working methods, young people had no choice but to obey senior researchers and did not participate in the discussion. The representative of the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy introduced the leap forward situation of the technical department of the institute. The technical department undertakes the design and manufacture of new equipment needed by the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, with about 50 people, including three party members (two party members are workers). However, due to the weak technical and administrative leadership of the technical department, the work has not been carried out for a long time. The staff had complaints, believing that without technical leadership, the work could not be carried out. In this rectification and great leap forward, due to the change in the thinking of party members, together with non-party comrades, they criticized resentment and inferiority, and decided to think boldly and work boldly, and rely on their own strength to get the work done. As a result, they formulated a long-term plan, comprehensively organized the current work, and came up with some projects that they had never dared to think of in the past, and these projects are being gradually realized. For example, the design of the pebble-bed hot blast stove, the design institute of the industrial sector was unwilling to do it because it had not designed it in the past. At first, the staff of the technical department thought that we could not do what the design institute did not dare to do. However, after the Party organization mobilized everyone to break superstitions, they not only made the design, but also manufactured it.

The congress discussed how to strengthen the Party's leadership over science. Yu Wen said in summarizing the opinions of the representatives that the Party's leading role in science is first manifested in grasping the situation, standing at the forefront of the situation, and guiding the work to the correct direction and to victory. The Party must grasp scientific work and scientific thought, mainly to actively promote adherence to political principles in scientific work, combine with national needs, and according to actual conditions, determine the direction of tasks, formulate plans, propose measures, organize and allocate forces, adjust relations, and check the progress and results of work. The Party must grasp business, and at the same time grasp ideology through business. Only by constantly achieving victories in political ideology can the development of business be driven.

Regarding how the Party leads the great leap forward in science, the congress agreed with the five principles put forward by Zhang Jingfu, Secretary of the Party Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: lead business with politics, lead expertise with redness; continue to liberate thought and break superstitions; follow the mass line; organize a great leap forward in scientific work; and organize the leap forward movement rhythmically, advancing wave upon wave.

Who does the development of scientific undertakings under the leadership of the Party rely on? Before the rectification campaign, some leading Party cadres in scientific institutions did not have a very correct understanding of this issue. Some advocated relying on old scientists, and some advocated relying on young people. However, the mainstream of thought was to rely on old scientists. This congress believes that both the saying of relying on old scientists or relying on young people is one-sided. It should be firmly relying on the majority of the masses, but should attach importance to cultivating young emerging forces. The past shortcomings were mainly relying on a few experts. Some people raised the question of whether the bourgeois intellectuals in scientific institutions are reliable since there are so many of them. The congress believes that the question of whether they are reliable depends on the leadership of the Party and the ideological transformation of the intellectuals. The more thorough the transformation, the more reliable they are.

How does the Party lead science to realize the mass line? Before the rectification campaign, this issue was also unclear. Some people believed that scientific work is special, and the Party's mass line is not applicable here. The congress believes that this view is actually a right-leaning view that weakens the Party's leadership. The congress believes that the mass line can and must be implemented in scientific work, just like all other work. Implementing the mass line in scientific work mainly means implementing the policy of combining experts with the broad masses; in research units, the policy of combining young and old, combining high, middle, and junior personnel, and combining all types of staff should be promoted.

Tian Fu, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported to the congress on the 36-point leap forward program of the Party Committee. The congress adopted this program. The program puts forward measures in three aspects: giving prominence to politics and planting red flags everywhere on the scientific front, cultivating scientific personnel to be red and expert, and changing styles and improving methods. The most exciting point in the program is: strive to establish a large working-class scientific team in five years or a shorter period of time. About 80% of the members of this team are leftists; it is required that on the existing basis, after about a year, the number of party members among senior scientific and technical personnel, young scientific and technical personnel, administrative cadres, and workers of the Academy of Sciences will be greatly increased.

The congress was attended by 144 representatives of grassroots party organizations from 55 units in the Beijing area of the Academy of Sciences, as well as more than 600 people attending and observing.

### 中国科学院举行党代表大会  决定加强党对科学工作的领导

    中国科学院举行党代表大会
    决定加强党对科学工作的领导
    新华社5日讯　7月1日到5日在北京举行的中共中国科学院机关二届代表大会表明：党不但可以和应该领导科学行政和科学组织工作，同样可以而且必须领导科学业务。北京各研究所最近期间为庆祝党的生日和科学院党代会创造出来的九百七十二项研究成果（其中一百零七项达到或超过国际水平），证明科学有了党的领导才能跃进。
    这次大会的中心议题是在科学工作中贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，政治挂帅，加强党对科学事业的领导。与会者一致认为只有加强了党对科学的领导，政治挂了帅，才能贯彻党的总路线。
    中国科学院党委书记郁文代表上届党委向大会作的工作报告中说，自从第一届党代会以来的三年中，中国科学院党的工作的主要成绩是：组织和整顿了科学队伍，为科学工作准备了条件，开展了科学研究工作，培养了干部，并且取得了一定的科学研究成果；进行了政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，在思想上、组织上、工作上为科学工作更迅速更有力地发展扫清了道路。报告中指出：在整风以前，科学院党的工作中的主要缺点是政治思想工作薄弱，在有关科学工作的一些带根本性的问题上，长期未得到明确解决，主要表现在没有在科学工作中建立起党的坚强的领导。在这次整风期间，这些缺点已经基本克服。
    许多代表在大会上举出大量事实证明科学的跃进必须有党的领导；党完全可以领导科学。应用物理研究所代表的发言中介绍了这个研究所半导体室大跃进的经验：首先是党组织领导大家提出明确的任务。任务提出后就领导大家务虚，讨论任务的政治意义。工作中一碰到困难和阻碍的时候，党就领导大家务虚，鼓干劲，检查思想，拔白旗，插红旗，困难就迎刃而解。在研究工作的具体做法上，党组织也发动群众来解决问题。例如晶体管如何做法，大家提出了许多方案，经过开会讨论，选定了四种方法，用四种方法去完成一个目标，当在工作过程发现某一方法进行得最好最快最有把握的时候，党组织就调集力量去重点突击，而不像过去那样，某一科学家在外国文献上查得了一个什么方法，灵机一动，就交给青年人一个什么任务，不要说不谈工作意义，就说工作方法，青年人也只有听命高级研究人员而没有参加讨论的余地。化工冶金研究所的代表介绍了这个研究所技术室的跃进情况。技术室承担着化工冶金所需要的新设备的设计和制造任务，有五十人左右，其中三个是党员（两个党员是工人）。但技术室由于技术领导和行政领导薄弱，长期以来工作没有展开。工作人员有抱怨情绪，认为缺乏技术领导，工作就没法开展。这次在整风大跃进中，由于党员的思想有了转变，同党外同志一道批判了怨气和自卑感，决定大胆地想，大胆地干，靠自己力量把工作搞起来。结果订出了长远规划，全面组织了当前的工作，想出了一些过去从来不敢想的项目，这些项目正在逐步实现。例如石球热风炉的设计，工业部门的设计院因为过去没有设计过，所以不愿意干。起初，技术室工作人员认为设计院不敢干的事我们更不能干了。但是党组织发动大家破除迷信以后，现在不仅作出了设计，而且制造出来了。
    大会讨论了如何加强党对科学的领导问题。郁文在总结代表们的意见时说，党对科学的领导作用首先表现在掌握形势，站在形势前头，把工作引导到正确的方向，引导工作走向胜利。党必须抓科学业务、科学思想，主要是在科学工作中积极提倡坚持政治原则，结合国家需要，根据实际条件，确定方针任务，制定计划，提出措施，组织和调配力量，调整关系，检查工作进行情况和结果。党要抓业务，同时要通过业务抓思想，只有政治思想上不断取得胜利才能带动业务的发展。
    关于党怎样领导科学大跃进，大会同意中共中国科学院党组书记张劲夫提出的五项原则：以政治带业务，以红带专；继续解放思想，破除迷信；走群众路线；组织科学工作大跃进；有节奏地组织跃进运动，一浪推一浪地前进。
    党领导下发展科学事业依靠谁？在整风以前，科学机关中有些党的领导干部对这个问题的认识不是很正确的，有的人主张依靠老科学家，有的人主张依靠青年。但思想的主流是依靠老科学家。这次大会认为依靠老科学家或者依靠青年人这两种说法都是片面的，应该是坚定地依靠群众大多数，但应重视培养青年新生力量。过去的缺点主要是依靠了少数专家。有人提出科学机关资产阶级知识分子为数很多，是不是靠得住？大会认为是否靠得住的问题决定于党的领导，决定于知识分子的思想改造，改造越彻底，就越靠得住。
    党领导科学怎样实现群众路线？在整风以前，对于这个问题也是不明确的。有些人认为科学工作特殊，党的群众路线在这里不适用。大会认为这种观点实际上是削弱党的领导的右倾观点。大会认为在科学工作中可以而且必须贯彻群众路线，同其他一切工作一样。在科学工作中贯彻群众路线主要是实行专家与广大群众相结合的方针；在研究单位中应提倡青老结合，高、中、初级人员结合，各类工作人员结合的方针。
    中国科学院党委副书记田夫代表党委在会上报告了党委工作跃进纲要三十六条。大会通过了这个纲要。纲要中提出了在科学战线上政治挂帅、遍插红旗，培养科学人员红透专深，改变作风、改进方法等三方面的措施。纲要中最令人兴奋的一条是：力争在五年或短一点的时间内，建立一支宏大的工人阶级科学队伍，这支队伍80％左右的成员为左派；要求在现有的基础上，经过一年左右的时间，使科学院的高级科学技术人员、青年科学技术人员、行政干部和工人中的党员数量都有很大的增加。
    参加这次大会的有科学院北京区的五十五个单位的党基层组织的代表一百四十四人以及列席、旁听人员六百多人。
