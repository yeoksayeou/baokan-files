Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The newly appointed Ceylonese Ambassador to China, William Gooneratne, accompanied by diplomats from the embassy, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China on the evening of the 7th.

Present were Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Wenjin, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department.

After presenting the credentials, Ambassador Gooneratne presented Chairman Mao Zedong with valuable gifts from Ceylon.

Prior to this, Ambassador Gooneratne had called on Foreign Minister Chen Yi to discuss matters relating to the presentation of credentials.

Ambassador Gooneratne's Speech

In his speech during the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Gooneratne said, "We all know that friendly and amicable relations and close cultural ties have existed between our two countries since ancient times. Due to circumstances beyond the control of our two peoples, our mutual contact was interrupted for a period. But since our two countries were able to freely decide their own issues, this contact has resumed. Since then, our relationship has grown stronger. Now, our mutual cooperation extensively includes all aspects, which is of great benefit to both of our countries.

"Please allow me to convey the good wishes expressed by the personal representative of our Prime Minister on behalf of the people of Ceylon, who wish your great country and people continuous progress and prosperity, and wish our friendship to be further strengthened. Just like you, we warmly hope and wish that the efforts of our two countries and peoples, as well as the efforts of other peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, will enable us to achieve true and creative world peace.

"Please allow me to take this opportunity to thank Your Excellency, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for the sincere care shown to the former ambassador. Without a doubt, I will also receive the same sincere care. I would like to assure Your Excellency that I will do my utmost to make myself worthy of this trust and care."

Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply

Chairman Mao Zedong replied, "Ceylon, as one of the initiating countries of the Asian-African Conference, is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. In recent years, the government and people of Ceylon have made many efforts and beneficial contributions to the cause of striving for world peace, safeguarding national independence, opposing colonialism, and promoting international cooperation, especially friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries, which have been respected and welcomed by the people of Asian and African countries and the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people are willing to continue to work together with the government and people of Ceylon and all peace-loving countries and people in the world for world peace and the happiness of mankind.

"As Your Excellency said, the Chinese and Ceylonese people have engaged in friendly exchanges and formed close friendships since very early times. Last February, the prime ministers of China and Ceylon issued a joint statement, jointly confirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which has established a new and solid foundation for our historical ties of friendship. I firmly believe that on this basis, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Ceylonese people will be developed more and more broadly.

"I warmly welcome Your Excellency's appointment as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ceylon to the People's Republic of China, and I am willing to give full support and assistance to Your Excellency in your work to strengthen the friendly ties between China and Ceylon. I wish your country prosperity and your people thriving."

    锡兰新任驻华大使高伯拉瓦
    向毛泽东主席递交国书
    新华社7日讯  锡兰新任驻华大使威廉·高伯拉瓦在7日晚偕大使馆外交官，向中华人民共和国毛泽东主席递交国书。
    在场的有，国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，外交部亚洲司司长章文晋，礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    递交国书后，高伯拉瓦大使向毛泽东主席献了锡兰的名贵礼品。
    在此以前，高伯拉瓦大使曾拜会了陈毅外长，商谈递交国书事宜。
    高伯拉瓦大使致颂词
    递交国书时，高伯拉瓦大使致颂词说“我们都知道我们两国之间自古以来就存在着亲善和友好的关系以及密切的文化联系。由于发生了我们两国人民所不能控制的情况，我们相互之间的接触曾经中断了一个时期。但在我们两国得以自由地决定自己的问题以后，这种接触又恢复了。自从那时候起，我们之间的关系日益加强。现在，我们的相互合作广泛地包括各个方面，这对我们两国都有莫大的好处。
    “请允许我转达我国总理个人代表锡兰人民所表达的良好祝愿，他谨祝你们伟大的国家和人民不断进步、繁荣，祝我们的友谊进一步加强。正像你们一样，我们热烈地希望并祝愿我们两个国家和人民的努力以及世界上其他爱好和平的国家和人民的努力，将使我们获得真正的和创造性的世界和平。
    “请允许我借此机会感谢阁下，中国政府和人民对前任大使的诚挚关怀。毫无疑问，我也将得到同样的诚挚关怀。我谨向阁下保证，我将尽我最大的力量来使自己无愧于这种信任和关怀。”
    毛泽东主席致答词
    毛泽东主席致答词说：“锡兰作为亚非会议发起国家之一，在国际事务中正在起着日益重要的作用。近年来锡兰政府和人民为争取世界和平、维护民族独立、反对殖民主义、促进国际合作事业、特别是亚非国家间的友好合作，作出了很多的努力和有益的贡献，受到了亚非各国人民和中国人民的尊敬和欢迎。中国政府和人民愿意继续同锡兰政府和人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为世界和平和人类的幸福而共同努力。
    “如阁下所说，中国人民和锡兰人民从很早的时候起就进行了友好往来，结成了亲密的友谊。去年2月，中锡两国总理发表联合声明，共同确认了和平共处的五项原则，这就为我们历史上的友谊联系建立了新的巩固的基础。我深信，在这样的基础上，中锡人民的传统友谊将得到越来越广阔的发展。
    “我热烈地欢迎阁下出任锡兰驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使，并愿为阁下在加强中锡两国友好联系的工作中给以充分支持和协助。谨祝贵国繁荣，人民兴旺。”
