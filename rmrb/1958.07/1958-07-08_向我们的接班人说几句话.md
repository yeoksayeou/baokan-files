A Few Words to Our Successors
　　Méi Lánfāng
The eighth-grade students of the Peking Opera Department of the China Academy of Traditional Opera have graduated. These were the first students enrolled in 1950, after the liberation. At that time, we all participated in the examination committee's work. Now, seeing their graduation performance, I am very happy. I also deeply feel how the Party and the government care for and support the next generation of opera actors, and how the teachers painstakingly teach and guide them. This clear fact, displayed on a stage that everyone can see, once again proves that the right-wingers' fallacy that "the present is not as good as the past" has long been refuted.
　　On July 4th, at the school's rehearsal hall, I watched three programs performed by the students: "Picking the Sliding Chariot" is a weighty *kao* and *ba* martial male role (wusheng) play. Yu Dalu, who played Gao Chong, had accurate and steady hand, eye, body, and foot movements, as well as a sonorous voice. Improving on this foundation is the correct artistic path. In "Yu Tang Chun," Yang Qiuling, who played Su San, had a clear voice, clear enunciation, and natural movements and expressions. With such a foundation, she can grow with age through practice. Wu Yuzhang's Bao Zheng in "Accusing at the铡美案 (Zhamei Case)" reached a level of composure and steadiness in singing, recitation, and acting, possessing the qualities of a bronze-voiced painted face role. Cao Yilin, who played Qin Xianglian, was able to appropriately express the psychological state of the character in her expressions and movements, and she was also proficient in some basic *qingyi* movements.
　　In these three short plays, all the actors on stage were neat and serious, demonstrating the spirit of collectivism. They all have good basic skills. I often think that the artistic cultivation of opera actors should first seek stability and then seek change. For example, when building a building, if the foundation is solid, it can bear five, ten, or even dozens of stories above it, and there will be no danger of tilting or sinking.
　　The responsible comrades of the school told me that the graduating students will go to factories and mines for a two-month tour, and also participate in a period of labor training in the countryside, before taking up their work posts and engaging in long-term artistic practice. This arrangement of procedures is necessary. I have a few suggestions for the students:
　　1. Strengthen political study and improve ideological level. Artists have always had the precious title of "engineers of the human soul." Chairman Mao has also clearly pointed out that the direction of opera art is to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must seize the time, strengthen learning, and put politics in command. This will have a positive guiding role in your artistic cultivation, achieving the goal of being both red and expert.
　　2. Pay attention to health. I often say that actors cannot get sick. Therefore, diet and rest must be regular, pay attention to the cold and warmth, pay attention to hygiene, and the protection of the voice is especially important. Chinese opera emphasizes both singing and dancing, neither of which is indispensable. If you are not careful and damage your voice, it will affect the entire performance.
　　3. Delve deeply into art. Everyone knows the principle that art is endless, and if you don't advance, you will retreat. In my own fifty years, I have been honest, diligent, and hardworking, laying a foundation, and then constantly experiencing it in stage practice, carefully understanding it, and at the same time, widely accepting the correct opinions of the masses. Every time I perform a play, I have a new improvement, some of which are from the help of the masses, and some of which are from my own initiative. I still do this now. I am willing to introduce this experience to you for your reference.
　　4. Be modest in everything and avoid arrogance. Actors meet the masses every day. The enthusiasm of the masses can encourage our art to rise, but we must not be overwhelmed by the applause and cheers. Once arrogance arises, it will lead the performing arts to a path of decline, and it will be too late to regret it then. Every opera worker should remember what Chairman Mao said: "Modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one lag behind."
　　You are young actors trained by the Party. From socialism to communism, you will all be participating in work. What a great and beautiful future! I hope you will go all out, strive for the top, and make more contributions to the people's art cause.

    向我们的接班人说几句话
    梅兰芳
    中国戏曲学校京剧科八年级的学生毕业了，这是在1950年的时候，也就是解放后第一次招收的学生，当时我们都参加了考试委员会的工作，现在看到了他们的毕业汇报演出，感到非常高兴。我也深深地感到党和政府对下一代戏曲演员是如何的关怀、支持，老师们如何的循循善诱、苦心教导，这种鲜明的事实，摆在大家看得见的舞台上，又一次证明了右派分子今不如昔的谬论，早已不攻自破了。
    7月4日，在学校排演场，我看了学生的三个节目：“挑滑车”是分量很重的靠把武生戏，俞大陆主演高宠，手、眼、身、步、口准确稳练，还有高亢的嗓音，从这个基础上提高，是正确的艺术道路。“玉堂春”，杨秋玲饰苏三，嗓音清亮，字眼清楚，动作、神情也都自然，有这样的根柢，以后在实践中锻炼，是能够与年俱进的。“告刀铡美”，吴钰璋的包拯，唱、念、做工都达到沉着，稳当的程度，具备了铜锤花脸的条件。扮演秦香莲的曹毅琳，在表情动作上能够恰如其份地表达出剧中人物的心理状态，同时，对一些青衣的基本动作，也都很熟练。
    这三个短剧中，全场演员都整齐严肃，表现出集体主义的精神。他们的功底都不错。我常常这样想，戏曲演员在艺术上的进修，应该是先求稳重，次求变化。譬如盖一所楼房，基础打得巩固，上面盖五层、十层，乃至几十层都负担得了，决不会有倾敧下陷的危险。
    学校的负责同志对我讲，毕业的学生将要到工厂、矿山巡回演出两个月，还要到农村参加一个时期的劳动锻炼，然后，分别走上工作岗位，从事长期的艺术实践，这种程序的安排是必要的。我对同学们还有几点建议：
    一、加强政治学习，提高思想水平。艺术家一向有“人类灵魂工程师”的可贵称号，戏曲艺术为工农兵服务的方向，也早经毛主席明白指出，我们必须抓紧时间，加强学习，政治挂帅。这样，对你的艺术进修能够发生积极的主导作用，达到又红又专的目的。
    二、注意健康。我常说演员是不能生病的，因此，饮食作息，都要有规律，寒暖当心、注重卫生，嗓音的保护尤为重要，中国戏曲是歌舞并重，缺一不可的，如果不小心，把嗓子弄坏，这就影响了全部表演。
    三、深入钻研艺术。大家都知道艺术无止境，不进则退的道理。我自己在这五十年中就是老老实实，勤勤恳恳，深耕细作，打下底子，然后在不断的舞台实践中，用心体会，同时，广泛地接受群众的正确意见。我每演一次戏，总有一次新的改进，有些是群众对我的帮助，也有些是出于我自发的，一直到现在，我还是这样做。我愿意把这一点经验，介绍给你们作为参考。
    四、遇事虚心，力戒骄傲。演员是天天和群众见面的，群众的热情，能够鼓舞我们的艺术上升，但千万不可被鼓掌喝采的声音冲昏了头脑。一产生骄气，就会引导表演艺术走向衰退没落的道路，到那时候，悔之晚矣。每一个戏曲工作者都应该记住毛主席说的：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”
    你们是党培养出来的青年演员，从社会主义一直到共产主义时期，你们都是要参加工作的，前途是何等的远大和美丽，我希望你们鼓足干劲，力争上游，为人民的艺术事业，做出更多的贡献。
