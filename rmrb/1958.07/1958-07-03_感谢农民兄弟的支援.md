Thank you to our farmer brothers for their support

On April 26th, our survey team moved from Qinling to Piantou Mountain to build survey markers. At 5:00 PM that day, we arrived at Anli Village (Pingtou Township, Baoji County, Shaanxi Province) at the foot of Piantou Mountain and discovered that the materials were stored at Niangniangmiao Primary School, twenty li away. We planned to transport the materials that day to avoid delaying work the next day due to lack of materials. So we asked the Anli Village Agricultural Cooperative for assistance. Secretary Wang of the cooperative readily agreed, but all the cooperative members were working in the fields. Secretary Wang said he would send people after the members returned at night. We thought that the members had been working hard from morning till night and needed to rest in the evening, so we declined his kind offer.

At 9:00 PM, twenty farmers suddenly arrived, saying they were there to help us carry the materials. We repeatedly urged them to go back, but they started working anyway. That night, they traveled forty li of mountain road back and forth and transported all the materials to the top of Piantou Mountain by 5:00 AM the next morning. When we thanked them, they repeatedly said, "Your work is our work. If we only care about ourselves and don't help others, what kind of socialism is that!" When we parted, we wished each other well and encouraged each other.

    感谢农民兄弟的支援
    4月26日，我们测量小组由秦岭迁往偏头山埋造测标。当天下午五时，赶到偏头山下庵里村（陕西省宝鸡县平头乡），发现材料放在二十里外的娘娘庙小学里，我们打算当天把材料运来，免得第二天停工待料。于是去请庵里村农业社协助，社里的王支书慨然应允，但是社员们都下地干活去了。王支书说，等天黑社员回来后再派人吧。我们想，社员们起早贪黑干了一天，晚上需要休息，就谢绝了他的好意。
    晚上九点钟，突然来了二十个农民，说是来帮我们搬运材料的。我们一再劝他们回去，他们还是动手干起来，当夜往返跑了四十里的山路，到第二天早五点钟把全部材料运到了偏头山顶。当我们向他们道谢的时候，他们一再说：“你们的工作就是我们的工作，如果光顾自己，不协助别人，这还算什么社会主义！”大家在分别的时候，一面祝好，一面互相鼓励。
