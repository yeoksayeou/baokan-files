Xinhua News Agency, London, July 20th: This agency reporter Peng Di reports: The United States and British governments have decided to keep their invading armies in the Middle East, not only to continue occupying Lebanon and Jordan, but also to facilitate further military action against other Middle Eastern countries.

    The London "Observer" reporter, Philip Deane, reported in a dispatch from Washington that Dulles and Lloyd had reached an agreement that US and British troops would not withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan unless "satisfactory arrangements" were made to "protect Lebanon and Jordan, and, when necessary, protect other small countries from indirect aggression by infiltrating agents and inflammatory radio propaganda."

    They also decided to use force in the oil centers of Kuwait and Bahrain when they deemed it necessary. The message said: "The US and Britain are now jointly planning for the US to airlift British troops to those sheikdoms when necessary."
      The "Sunday Times" reported that the area involved in the Anglo-American agreement on further military action included not only the Persian Gulf but also Libya and Sudan.

    Dulles and Lloyd also decided not to recognize the Republic of Iraq and decided to leave the question of whether King Hussein of Jordan is legally the head of the now-defunct Iraqi-Jordanian Federation hanging in the balance, thereby opening the door for them to use Hussein to attack Iraq.

    They also agreed that "elections" should be held in Lebanon on July 24. Murphy, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State currently in Beirut, has been ordered to arrange this matter, preparing to hold so-called "elections" in Lebanon under American bayonets according to American wishes.

    At the same time, the speed of US and British military build-up is increasing. The United States is transporting 11,000 soldiers to Lebanon, and Britain is transporting 6,000 troops to Jordan.

### 美英决定赖在黎约两国  并准备侵略其他中东国家

    美英决定赖在黎约两国
    并准备侵略其他中东国家
    新华社伦敦20日电  本社记者彭迪报道：美英两国政府决定，要把它们的侵略军留在中东，这不仅仅是为了继续占领黎巴嫩和约旦，而且也是为了便于它们对其他中东国家采取进一步的军事行动。
    伦敦“观察家报”记者菲利普·迪恩在从华盛顿发回的电讯中报道说，杜勒斯和劳埃德已经达成了这样的协议：美英军队不撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，除非作出了“令人满意的安排”以“保护黎巴嫩和约旦，并且在必要的时候保护其他小国不受渗入的特务和煽动性的电台宣传进行的间接侵略。”
    他们还决定，在他们认为必要的时候将在石油中心科威特和巴林使用武力。这条消息说：“英美现在共同计划由美国在必要的时候把英国军队空运到那些教长国去。”
      “星期日泰晤士报”的消息说：英美关于采取进一步军事行动的协议所涉及的地区不仅包括波斯湾而且包括利比亚和苏丹。
    杜勒斯和劳埃德还决定不承认伊拉克共和国，并且决定让约旦国王侯赛因在法律上究竟是不是已经不存在的伊拉克—约旦联邦的元首这个问题吊在那里，从而为他们利用侯赛因进攻伊拉克敞开大门。
    他们还一致认为，应该在7月24日在黎巴嫩举行“选举”。现在在贝鲁特的美国副国务卿帮办墨菲已经奉命安排这件事，准备在美国刺刀下根据美国的愿望来在黎巴嫩举行所谓“选举”。
    同时，美英军事集结的速度越来越高。美国正在把一万一千名士兵运到黎巴嫩去，英国正在运送六千名军队到约旦去。
