Comrades and friends!

    The Iraqi revolution has triumphed! The independent Republic of Iraq has been established. This is a great victory for the Iraqi people and a great victory for the struggle of oppressed nations worldwide against imperialism. We, the Chinese people, have also suffered the cruel oppression and rule of imperialism and its lackeys in the past, and we have also waged a long and arduous struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. Therefore, we have always regarded the victory of the oppressed people's struggle as our own victory. We congratulate the birth of the Republic of Iraq and the victory of the Iraqi people with great excitement. At the same time, based on our own experience, we firmly believe that once oppressed countries and people gain independence and freedom, they will certainly know how to defend it. If imperialism and its lackeys want to restore their reactionary rule, they are bound to suffer crushing defeat!

    Of course, we see very clearly that imperialism is never reconciled to its failure. This time, the most reactionary imperialist boss, U.S. imperialism, has come again. Under the pretext of so-called "protecting its citizens" and "protecting the sovereignty of Lebanon," it has dispatched armed forces to land in Lebanon and is brazenly interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. U.S. imperialism's little accomplice, British imperialism, is also striking a pose and drumming up support, attempting to launch an aggression against Jordan, Iraq, and the United Arab Republic, to oppress the Arab people and strangle the national independence movement in the Arab East. This is something that we Chinese people can never tolerate! It is also something that peace-loving people all over the world can never tolerate! The entire Chinese people deeply know from their past struggles against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, that if we do not counter imperialist aggression with more resolute anti-aggression actions, if we allow imperialism to act as it pleases, not only will the people of Arab countries suffer undue and cruel sacrifices, but a new world war will also be inevitable. Therefore, we firmly support the statement issued yesterday by our government against the U.S. armed intervention in Lebanon. We are determined to join the people of the whole country, use practical actions, and use all our strength to support the just struggle of the Lebanese, Iraqi, and Arab people, and to shatter the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal.

    People of Asian and African countries, unite!
    All peace-loving people of the world, unite!
    Oppose aggression and defend peace! Resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Arab people against aggression!
    Long live the national independence movement of oppressed nations!
    Long live world peace!

    侵略者一定要碰得头破血流
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培的讲话亲爱的同志们！朋友们！
    伊拉克的革命胜利了！建立了独立的伊拉克共和国。这是伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，也是全世界被压迫民族反对帝国主义的斗争的伟大胜利。我们中国人民，过去同样受过帝国主义和它的走狗们的残酷压迫和统治，同样和帝国主义和它的走狗们进行过长期的、艰苦的斗争。因此，一向把被压迫人民斗争的胜利当做自己的胜利，我们以万分兴奋的心情，祝贺伊拉克共和国的诞生，祝贺伊拉克人民的胜利。同时，我们以自己的经验，坚决地相信，被压迫的国家和人民，一旦获得了独立和自由，他们就一定会知道应当怎样去保卫它，如果帝国主义和它的走狗们要想恢复他们的反动统治，他们一定要碰得头破血流！
    当然，我们看得很清楚，帝国主义总是不甘心于他们的失败的，这一次，最反动的帝国主义头子美帝国主义又来了，它借口所谓“保护侨民”和“保护黎巴嫩主权”，派遣武装部队在黎巴嫩登陆，和横暴地干涉黎巴嫩的内政，美帝国主义的小伙计英帝国主义，也在装腔作势，摇旗呐喊，妄图对约旦、伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国发动侵略，压迫阿拉伯人民，扼杀阿拉伯东方的民族独立运动。这是我们中国人民所万万不能容忍的！也是全世界爱好和平人民所万万不能容忍的！全中国人民从过去对帝国主义特别是对美帝国主义的斗争中深切知道，如果不以更坚决的反侵略行动来对付帝国主义侵略行动，如果听任帝国主义为所欲为，不但阿拉伯各国人民会遭到不应有的残酷牺牲，新的世界大战也会不可避免。因此，我们坚决拥护我国政府昨天发表的关于反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的声明。我们决心和全国人民一道，用实际行动，用一切力量，来支援黎巴嫩、伊拉克和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，不达目的，决不罢休。
    亚非各国人民团结起来！
    全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结起来！
    反对侵略，保卫和平！坚决支持阿拉伯人民抵抗侵略的英勇斗争！
    被压迫民族独立运动万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
