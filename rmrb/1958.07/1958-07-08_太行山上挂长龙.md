    A Long Dragon Hanging on the Taihang Mountains
    In April, the Taihang Mountains are covered with peach and plum blossoms, making it a great season for geological workers to conduct field work. We carried our instruments and luggage to the Taihang Mountains to look for mineral deposits. One day, we arrived at the Huangshuikou area of Huixian County, Henan Province, and were stopped by a very dangerous plank road on Jiupeng Mountain, which rises more than 2,000 meters above sea level. Because this plank road was on a cliff hundreds of meters high, with a crack more than one meter wide, we tried to climb it many times with our instruments and luggage, but we couldn't make it. At this time, the farmers on Jiupeng Mountain heard that our exploration team was stuck at the foot of the mountain, and immediately more than eighty young men and women came. They formed a long dragon team in this dangerous and narrow stone crevice on the mountainside of the Taihang Mountains, passing our instruments and luggage piece by piece from below. In less than an hour, all the instruments, grain, and luggage were moved to the top of the mountain, allowing us to safely reach the summit of the Taihang Mountains.
    When we reached the top of the Taihang Mountains, the sun shone on the rolling mountains, and the Yellow River flowed windingly across the North China Plain. We sang a song praising our socialist motherland, a song praising the hard-working and brave people, to thank the farmer brothers and sisters of Dabie Mountain for their help.

    太行山上挂长龙
    4月的太行山上，满山桃李，正是地质工作者野外工作的好季节。我们带着仪器和行装，到太行山去找矿苗。一天，我们走到河南辉县黄水口地区，被拔海二千多公尺的九棚山上的一段十分险恶的栈道挡住了去路。因为这条栈道是在高达数百公尺的悬崖陡壁上，有一条一公尺多宽的裂缝，我们挑着仪器和行李试爬了多少次，都没能爬上去。这时，九棚山上的农民听说我们探矿队阻在山下，立刻来了八十多名青年男女，在太行山山腰上这条险恶的狭窄的石缝中，排起了一条长龙队，一个接着一个地把我们的仪器和行李一件一件的从下面传递上去。在不到一小时内，就把全部仪器、粮食和行李搬到山顶，使我们安全地登上了太行山顶。
    我们登上太行山顶，阳光照耀着起伏的群山，黄河奔流蜿蜒在华北大平原上。我们唱了一支歌颂社会主义的祖国，歌颂勤劳和勇敢的人民的歌，来感谢大别山农民兄弟姊妹们对我们的帮助。
