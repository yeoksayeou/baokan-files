Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 14th: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has begun organizing its second water conservancy construction upsurge. This upsurge centers on thoroughly changing the backward state of the Autonomous Region's 23 million mu of old irrigation areas, carrying out large-scale land leveling throughout the region, and repairing and merging all outdated canals to liberate a large amount of water resources to meet the Autonomous Region's needs for large-scale land reclamation and soil improvement.

Currently, preparations are actively underway in various parts of southern Xinjiang. Counties in Kashgar, Hotan, and Korla prefectures are combining land planning with work to rebuild old irrigation areas. Shule County's more than 260 agricultural cooperatives recently arranged land consolidation and irrigation systems. Xinhe County, which lacks water sources, merged two main canals and 500 branch canals in the old irrigation area, and installed 144 water gates at each distribution point, greatly reducing leakage losses. In the past, Korla County over-irrigated, wasting a lot of water. This year, while repairing and merging canals, agricultural cooperatives also dug more than 300 drainage canals in the irrigation area to lower the groundwater level, turning 40,000 mu of saline-alkali land into fertile fields and expanding the irrigated area by more than 20,000 mu.

Xinjiang has little rainfall throughout the year and is a region that relies entirely on snowmelt for irrigation. In order to expand the cultivated area, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region launched a large-scale water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring. For more than half a year, more than 5,000 agricultural cooperatives and soldiers of the military reclamation farms braved wind, snow, and severe cold to build more than 99,500 canals of various sizes and more than 300 reservoirs in the wilderness north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In arid areas, they also dug more than 1,500 karez wells and many mountain springs, expanding the irrigated area by 4.9 million mu and improving the irrigated area by 6.78 million mu, overfulfilling the annual task. These projects have played a significant role in the fight against drought this year.

In order to find irrigation water sources for large-scale land reclamation in 1959, the key lies in changing the old irrigation areas. The Autonomous Region's old irrigation areas are all located in the upper reaches of various rivers, and the cultivated land they irrigate accounts for 85% of the region's cultivated land. Every year, 80% of the flow of various rivers is intercepted and introduced into the old irrigation areas. However, the canals in these irrigation areas are numerous and disordered, the water conveyance canals are long, and leakage is serious. It is estimated that of the nearly 50 billion cubic meters of water intercepted and diverted by the old irrigation areas, less than 30% is actually used in the fields, and most of the rest is wasted. In the lower reaches of various rivers, tens of millions of mu of wasteland are difficult to develop because the water does not flow down. At the same time, due to the lack of water intake control projects and excessive irrigation, most of the land in the old irrigation areas has varying degrees of salinization. Therefore, changing the old irrigation areas has become a central issue.

According to the water conservancy department's investigation, by carrying out land leveling, canal repair, and combining canal heads in the old irrigation areas, implementing rational irrigation, and building some small-scale water storage projects, more than 20 billion cubic meters of water can be saved, increasing the irrigated area from the current 27 million mu to 60 million mu. At the same time, a large amount of saline-alkali land will be further improved through appropriate irrigation, the establishment of drainage systems, and other improvement measures, correspondingly increasing the yield per unit area. Therefore, the Autonomous Region's water conservancy department has decided to take changing the face of the old irrigation areas as the center of the second water conservancy upsurge, mobilizing 2 million laborers to start now, leveling the land according to plan on 23 million mu of land in the old irrigation areas, cutting branches and merging trunks, and digging drainage canals to give the old irrigation areas in the Autonomous Region, which have continued for hundreds of years, a thorough turnaround.

### 改造旧灌区解放水源  新疆组织第二个水利建设高潮  灌溉面积将比现在增加一倍多

    改造旧灌区解放水源
    新疆组织第二个水利建设高潮
    灌溉面积将比现在增加一倍多
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　新疆维吾尔自治区开始组织第二个水利建设高潮。这个高潮是以彻底改变自治区二千三百万亩旧灌区的落后面貌为中心，在全自治区范围内进行土地大平整，整修、合并所有陈旧渠道，以解放出大量水源，满足自治区大规模垦荒和改良土壤的用水需要。
    目前，南疆各地已积极准备。喀什、和阗、库尔勒等专区各县正结合土地规划展开改建旧灌区的工作。疏勒县二百六十多个农业社最近进行了土地连片和灌溉系统的安排。水源不足的新和县把旧灌区两条主渠和五百条支渠加以合并，并在各分水口安装了一百四十四个水闸，大大减少了渗漏损失。库尔勒县过去灌水过量，浪费了很多水。今年各农业社在整修、合并渠道同时，还在灌区内挖掘了三百多条排碱渠道，降低了地下水位，使四万亩盐碱地变成了良田，并扩大了二万多亩灌溉面积。
    新疆终年少雨，是一个完全依靠雪水灌溉的地区。为了扩大耕地面积，自治区各族农民在去冬今春展开了大规模兴修水利运动。半年多以来，自治区五千多个农业社和各军垦农场的战士们，冒风雪严寒，在天山南北的荒野上，修建了九万九千五百多条大小渠道和三百多座水库，干旱地区还挖掘了一千五百多道坎儿井和很多山泉，扩大灌溉面积四百九十万亩，改善灌溉面积六百七十八万亩，超额完成了全年任务。这些工程对今年各地抗旱斗争起了很大作用。
    为了给1959年大规模开荒找到灌溉水源，关键在于改变旧灌区。自治区旧灌区都处于各河流的上游，它灌溉的耕地占全区耕地面积85％，每年各河流80％的流量都被拦截引入旧灌区。但是这些灌区的渠道多而紊乱，输水渠道长，渗漏严重。据估计，被各地旧灌区拦截引用的近五百亿方水，灌到田里的还不到30％，其余大部分都浪费了。而在各河流下游数千万亩荒地因为水流不下来开发有困难。同时，由于缺少控制进水工程，过量灌水，使得大部旧灌区土地都有程度不等的盐碱化现象。所以改变旧灌区就成为中心问题。
    根据水利部门调查，通过对旧灌区进行土地平整、整修渠道、合并龙口等工程措施，实行合理灌溉，并修建一些小型蓄水工程，就可以节省出二百多亿方水，使灌溉面积从现有的二千七百万亩增加到六千万亩。同时，大量盐碱土地通过适量灌水、建立排水系统等改善措施，也进一步得到改良，相应提高单位面积产量。因此，自治区水利部门决定以改变旧灌区面貌作为第二个水利高潮的中心，动员二百万劳动大军，从现在开始，在旧灌区二千三百万亩土地上按照规划平整土地、裁支并干，挖掘排水渠道，使自治区延续几百年的陈旧灌区来一个彻底大翻身。
