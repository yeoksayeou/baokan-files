Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 23rd: Newspapers here today published the note from the Hungarian Embassy in Belgrade, entrusted by its government, to the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia. This note severely refuted the Yugoslav government's "protest" note of June 23rd to the Hungarian government regarding the execution of the traitor Nagy Imre. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Embassy of the Hungarian People's Republic in Belgrade presents its compliments to the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs of the Federal People's Republic of Yugo slavia and, entrusted by the Hungarian government, makes the following notification:

The Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest forwarded Note No. 351-58 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic on June 23rd of this year. In this note, the Yugoslav government expressed "deep sorrow" due to the sentencing of Nagy Imre and his accomplices. According to it, the statements in the judicial bulletin regarding the activities of Nagy Imre and his accomplices during their stay at the Yugoslav Embassy are untrue. According to the views expressed by the Yugoslav government in the note, the judicial bulletin implies an attack on the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, the purpose of which is to sharpen the "organized anti-Yugoslav movement that is already underway" and prove its correctness. Furthermore, the Yugoslav government also suspects the Hungarian government of violating some agreement. As for the Yugoslav government's actions, the note asserts that "Yugoslavia has never interfered in Hungary's internal affairs, nor is it doing so now." On the contrary, "Yugoslavia has made significant and selfless efforts to help stabilize the situation in Hungary."

Regarding all of this, the Hungarian government authorizes its embassy in Belgrade to make the following statement:

In the case of Nagy Imre and his accomplices, the Supreme Court interrogated some Hungarian citizens because they committed crimes in violation of the laws of the Hungarian People's Republic. The defendants were all punished. These defendants committed treason and organized armed rebellion. Their fair punishment was determined strictly according to judicial regulations. Therefore, this case is entirely an internal affair of the Hungarian People's Republic, and no foreign government can interfere. Therefore, the government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia cannot interfere either. Therefore, the Hungarian government resolutely rejects any attempts in this regard, considering them to be unreasonable interference. In fact, the relevant Yugoslav institutions have repeatedly admitted that the Nagy Imre case is entirely an internal affair of Hungary.

The government of the Hungarian People's Republic vehemently refutes an obvious attempt in the Yugoslav note, namely the attempt to link the sentencing of Nagy Imre and his accomplices to the Rajk case. This is nothing more than a crude slander against our judicial organs, the purpose of which is to use the tragic Rajk case to cover up the crimes of Nagy Imre and his accomplices. The Yugoslav government's behavior is particularly outrageous, because it is well known that, in the case of Nagy Imre and his accomplices, the starting point of the interrogation was the most widespread public opinion and facts known to millions of people. The interrogation revealed, and the process of the interrogation also proved, the conscious conspiratorial activities of this group.

Although the Yugoslav note is an unreasonable interference in Hungary's internal affairs, it is still necessary to make the following explanations regarding the fabrications and inaccurate assertions in this note:

	(1) The Yugoslav government believes that it has been wronged by the following passage in the judicial bulletin concerning the Yugoslav Embassy: "Certain groups of conspirators, such as Nagy Imre, began to seek refuge in places where they had previously received support."

But the facts are as follows:

	(1) Milan Georgijevic, the First Secretary of the former Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest, had official contact with Vasarhelyi Miklos and Gimes Miklos from the spring of 1955. In the autumn of the same year, he asked these two to change their contact into a secret, conspiratorial nature. Later, through Vasarhelyi Miklos, he established the same conspiratorial contact with Janosi Ferenc and arranged secret meetings with them in private residences or in other conspiratorial environments. During these meetings, Gimes Miklos and Janosi Ferenc handed over to Milan Georgijevic the following documents written by Nagy Imre: "Morality and Ethics," "Some Urgent Issues," and "Five Basic Principles of International Relations." As can be seen from the announcement of the Hungarian Ministry of Justice, these documents were kept secret from the Hungarian government organs. These documents detailed the political tasks of Nagy Imre and his group: to overthrow the state system by force, to form an alliance with forces opposed to people's democracy, to abolish the Warsaw Pact, and to hand Hungary over to the imperialists.

	(2) During the period from October 23 to November 4, 1956, Losonczy Geza, entrusted by Nagy Imre, went to the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest five times, where he held talks with the then ambassador Dalibor Soldatic and the then counselor of the Yugoslav Embassy, Osman Dikic. During these talks, Ambassador Soldatic sought and obtained state secret information. Based on this information, he discussed further actions with Losonczy and openly interfered in Hungary's internal affairs.

	(2) The Yugoslav government expressed doubts about the following passage in the judicial bulletin: "Nagy Imre, Losonczy Geza, and others issued instructions from the Yugoslav Embassy, ordering the continuation of armed resistance, organizing strikes that paralyzed life, and reorganizing secret subversive activities." Then, "In the Yugoslav Embassy, they, through Gimes Miklos and other accomplices," established contact with the Budapest Central Workers' Council and Radio Free Europe, and even published a new secret newspaper, "October 23rd."

But the facts are as follows:

	(1) The Hungarians hiding in the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest established an "Executive Committee" on November 5, 1956, under the leadership of Nagy Imre, and held a series of talks with Ambassador Soldatic and other senior officials who had come specifically from Belgrade for this purpose. This committee, through personnel of the Yugoslav Embassy, issued instructions from within the embassy to members of the conspiracy group remaining in the city to continue their counter-revolutionary conspiracy. For example, on November 10, 1956, Tanzcos Gabor, entrusted by Nagy Imre, smuggled a document to Nagy Balazs, Gimes Miklos, and Adam Gyorgy through an embassy staff member. Based on the principles and instructions in this document, they began to organize the illegal "Hungarian Democratic Independence Movement," the purpose of which was to overthrow the state system. This document was the beginning of the publication of the secret newspaper "October 23rd." "October 23rd" was the organ of the "Executive Committee" established by the Nagy Imre faction, with Gimes Miklos as the editor-in-chief. This newspaper called for strikes and further organized treasonous activities.

	(2) On November 5, Losonczy Geza spoke with Porta Tivadar, one of the former right-wing leaders of the Independent Smallholders' Party, on the embassy's telephone, instructing him and other right-wing politicians to flee abroad, where they would join the Nagy Imre's conspiracy group and oppose the worker-peasant revolutionary government together.

	(3) According to Nagy Imre's instructions, on November 8, Fazekas Gyorgy, with the help of the embassy, sent messages from the embassy to Radio Free Europe through Julius Djuka, the Budapest correspondent for Belgrade's "Politika," and Gavro Altman, the Budapest correspondent for Belgrade's "Borba." The radio station immediately published the news.

	(4) Nagy Imre and others, with the assistance of the embassy, first established contact with the counter-revolutionary workers' council through the Yugoslav journalists Julius Djuka and Gavro Altman.

	(5) Nagy Imre and his accomplices obtained information about the instructions and plans of the legitimate state organs to suppress the counter-revolution through the Yugoslav Embassy, and on November 14, 1956, at the request of the embassy, formulated a new political program and strategy for seizing power.

	(3) Some staff members of the embassy, along with the above-mentioned two Yugoslav journalists, frequently interfered in Hungary's internal affairs during November-December 1956, and even later, after Nagy Imre and his group left the embassy.

For example, without notifying the Hungarian authorities and without obtaining their consent, these people, in cars of the Yugoslav Embassy with foreign embassy license plates, distributed Kadar's speech to the Federal National Assembly on December 7, 1956, in the Beloyannis Factory, the Hungarian Optical Instrument Factory, the April 4 Machine Factory, the Kelenfold Textile Factory, the Steel Plant, and the Csepel Factory. In this speech, Kadar opposed the worker-peasant revolutionary government and advocated the counter-revolutionary so-called worker councils to wield power.

	(4) The note attempts to create the illusion that the government of the Hungarian People's Republic violated some promise because the Hungarian judicial organs performed their legal duties in the case of Nagy Imre and his accomplices. According to the facts that have been revealed, this attempt is self-defeating. The Hungarian People's Republic has not violated any promises. The actual situation is as follows:

	(1) Before replying to the intolerable argument that the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest had the right to grant asylum to the Nagy Imre group, it should be mentioned under what circumstances and in what abnormal way this group arrived at the Yugoslav Embassy. On November 1, 1956, a plenipotentiary representative of the Nagy Imre group conducted negotiations with Ambassador Soldatic in the Parliament Building, discussing that the families of the representatives of the group could move into the Yugoslav Embassy. After November 4, some well-known Yugoslav figures said that Nagy Imre and others had fled to them to avoid the white terror. On the contrary, the fact that everyone is well aware of is that: due to the strength of the worker-peasant revolutionary government and the armed action of the Soviet army that was requested to assist, when Nagy Imre and his accomplices went to the Yugoslav Embassy, the white terror in the country had actually been basically eliminated. In addition, the way the group arrived at the Yugoslav Embassy was also exceptionally special. On the night of November 3, Yugoslav officials, based on obtained confidential information, learned that the worker-peasant revolutionary government and the Soviet army would launch a joint counter-offensive against the counter-revolution on the morning of November 4. At that time, Ambassador Soldatic personally called the leaders of the Nagy Imre group and said that Belgrade required them to exercise the right to asylum immediately. The gathering of other members of the group was also carried out under the direct guidance of Ambassador Soldatic. Someone called Losonczy Geza's house from the Yugoslav Embassy in the name of the ambassador, asking Ujhelyi Szilard and Haraszti Sandor to go to the embassy. At the same time, Culture Commissioner Milovanov asked Tancos Gabor to go to the embassy with his family, and the deputy military attaché of the embassy, Jovo Vuksic, gave his residence to Vasarhelyi Miklos and Erdöhegyi Peter for their use, and they did indeed use it. These actions of the embassy personnel are particularly serious, because on November 3, when the white terror was at its height, many progressive and upright patriots whose lives were threatened had wanted to seek protection at the Yugoslav Embassy, but they were all refused. Therefore, it is clear that the Yugoslav Embassy did not want to save Nagy Imre and his accomplices from the white terror, but to protect them from the sanctions of the highest authority - the Hungarian government.

	(2) There is no doubt that the Yugoslav Embassy gathered Nagy Imre and his accomplices together, allowed them to stay in the embassy, and described this practice as if it were granting asylum to the above-mentioned personnel, which was an abuse of diplomatic privileges by the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest. International law does not recognize the right of diplomatic missions to grant asylum. Among many famous international law experts, we cite the words of Dr. Milan Bartos, the main legal advisor to the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and a Yugoslav international law scholar, who wrote in a book published in 1956: "Today we cannot say that the right of asylum is a positive principle of international law" ("International Public Law," 1956 edition, page 460). Therefore, the act of the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest in sheltering the Nagy Imre group by granting asylum was an act that violated international law, an abuse of diplomatic privileges, and a clear interference in the internal affairs of the host country.

	(3) The worker-peasant revolutionary government only made the promise in November 1956 that it would not punish the members of the Nagy Imre group for the actions they had taken up to that time. The fact that the Hungarian government later agreed to the members of the group going to the Romanian People's Republic shows that the Hungarian government was completely in good faith. However, the Yugoslav officials who negotiated with the worker-peasant revolutionary government at that time already knew exactly the true nature of the activities of Nagy Imre and his group, but they concealed this from the Hungarian government and tried to create the illusion that Nagy Imre and his accomplices were caught up in counter-revolutionary crimes. They wanted to achieve a dual purpose by forcing the worker-peasant revolutionary government, which was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the counter-revolution, to reach an agreement: on the one hand, to prevent the exposure of the fact of Yugoslav interference in this way; on the other hand, to save the Nagy Imre group from punishment. In order to achieve this, they even attempted to force the Hungarian government to agree to send the Nagy Imre group to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. As is well known, the Hungarian government has never recognized the Yugoslav Embassy's views on the issue of asylum, and has firmly rejected the suggestion of sending the Nagy Imre group to Yugoslavia.

As for the punishment of these people, it was because the organized conspiratorial activities of Nagy Imre and his accomplices were gradually investigated by the Hungarian criminal and judicial organs. The reorganized judicial and criminal authorities could only gradually clarify the events that had occurred, the causes of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and the activities of the individuals who participated in the counter-revolutionary rebellion, as the situation stabilized. However, in the course of the investigation, it was necessary to start interrogating some people as early as January 1957. Those people had stayed in the Yugoslav Embassy with other people who were not held responsible or prosecuted from November 4 to 22, 1956. After careful and thorough investigation, the criminal and judicial organs of the Hungarian People's Republic filed a lawsuit against Nagy Imre and his group on January 28, 1958, by the Prosecutor's Office. Based on the prosecutor's indictment, the criminal court held its first trial on February 6, 1958. Due to supplementary evidence, a secret trial was conducted by the Supreme Court from June 9 to 15, 1958, and on June 17, the Ministry of Justice of the Hungarian People's Republic announced the well-known announcement regarding the verdict announced on June 15. Through this trial, the court revealed and proved the true background of Nagy Imre and his accomplices' open activities before November 4, and their role in conspiratorial treason, as well as their attempts to continue their counter-revolutionary actions in the Yugoslav Embassy in Budapest after November 4. The court made a fair judgment.

	(5) These indisputable facts show that the statement in the Yugoslav note, which believes that the Nagy Imre and his accomplices' trial case is related to the ongoing debate on the Draft Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, is also wrong and does not conform to reality. The facts prove that the verdict in this case is the culmination of the court interrogation that began in January 1957.

The Yugoslav note's assertion that the criminal proceedings against Nagy Imre and his group are a serious blow to relations between the two countries is also inconsistent with the facts. It is not the Supreme Court's verdict that has damaged Hungarian-Yugoslav relations, but the extremely serious activities of those Yugoslav officials who abused diplomatic privileges and frequently interfered in our internal affairs.

Based on the above facts, the following statement in the Yugoslav note is also strange: "Yugoslavia has made significant and selfless efforts to stabilize the situation in Hungary." While the Yugoslav government leaders, on the one hand, emphasize their friendship with the Hungarian People's Republic and the worker-peasant revolutionary government in public, on the other hand, Yugoslav officials protect and support those who threaten the state system of the Hungarian People's Republic. Their note serves the imperialist propaganda offensive against Hungary.

The Hungarian government most resolutely rejects the note from the Embassy of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Budapest and regards it as another unreasonable attempt to interfere. However, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic emphasizes that it is still willing to maintain and further develop state, economic, and cultural relations with Yugoslavia in the future. However, this relationship must be based on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. How much this desire of the Hungarian government can be realized depends on Yugoslavia's future attitude.

The Embassy of the Hungarian People's Republic in Belgrade takes this opportunity to express its compliments to the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia.

### 匈牙利政府给南斯拉夫政府的照会全文

    匈牙利政府给南斯拉夫政府的照会全文
    新华社布达佩斯23日电　此间报纸今天公布了匈牙利驻贝尔格莱德大使馆受本国政府委托，给南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处的照会。这份照会对南斯拉夫政府6月23日就处决叛国犯纳吉·伊姆雷的问题向匈牙利政府提出的“抗议”照会进行了严正的驳斥。照会全文如下：
    匈牙利人民共和国驻贝尔格莱德大使馆向南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国外交国务秘书处致意，谨受匈牙利政府的委托作如下的通知：
    南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆今年6月23日向匈牙利人民共和国外交部转交了第351—58号照会。在这份照会中，南斯拉夫政府由于纳吉·伊姆雷及其同谋者被判刑而表示“深切的悲痛”。据它看来，司法部公告中关于纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者在南斯拉夫大使馆逗留期间所进行的活动的陈述是不真实的。据南斯拉夫政府在照会中所表达的见解，司法部的公告意味着对南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的攻击，其目的在于使“已经在进行着的有组织的反南斯拉夫运动”尖锐化，并证明其正确。此外，南斯拉夫政府还怀疑匈牙利政府违反了什么协议。至于南斯拉夫政府的行径，照会断言“南斯拉夫从来没有干涉过匈牙利的内政，而且现在也没有这样做”。相反，“南斯拉夫为了帮助稳定匈牙利的局势，曾经作了重大的、无私的努力”。
    关于这一切，匈牙利政府授权它驻贝尔格莱德大使馆作如下的说明：
    在纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的案件中，最高法院对一些匈牙利公民进行审讯是由于他们犯了违反匈牙利人民共和国的法律的罪行。被告们都受到惩办。这些被告犯了叛国罪和组织武装暴乱的罪行，对他们的公平惩办，是严格的根据司法规章确定的。所以，这个案件完全是匈牙利人民共和国的内政，任何外国政府都不能加以干涉。因此，南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府也不能干涉。因此，匈牙利政府断然驳斥一切这方面的企图，认为这是无理的干涉。其实，有关的南斯拉夫机构也曾一再承认过纳吉·伊姆雷的案件完全是匈牙利的内政。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府十分愤慨地驳斥南斯拉夫照会的一个明显的企图，即力图把对纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的判决同拉伊克案件联系起来。这不外是对我国司法机关的粗暴诬蔑，其目的在于用拉伊克的悲剧案件来掩盖纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的罪行。南斯拉夫政府的行为特别令人愤怒，因为众所周知，在纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的案件中，审讯的出发点是最广泛的舆论和千千万万的人所了解的事实，审讯揭发了，并且在审讯的过程中也证明了这个集团的有意识的阴谋活动。
    虽然南斯拉夫的照会是对匈牙利内政的无理干涉，但对于这份照会中造成假象和不符合实际的断言还是有必要作如下的说明：
      （一）南斯拉夫政府认为，司法部公告中同南斯拉夫大使馆有关的这样一段话使它受到委屈，即“某些像纳吉·伊姆雷这样的阴谋者的集团开始到他们过去曾经得到支持的地方去寻找避难所”。
    可是事实如下：
      （1）前南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆一等秘书米兰·格奥尔基耶维奇从1955年春季起就同瓦沙尔赫利·米克洛什和吉梅什·米克洛什有正式联系，同年秋季，他要求这两个人把他们的联系改变成秘密的阴谋性质的联系。后来他通过瓦沙尔赫利·米克洛什又同亚诺希·费伦茨建立了同样的阴谋性质的联系，并同他们在私人住宅中或在其他阴谋活动的环境下安排了秘密会见。在这些会见的过程中，吉梅什·米克洛什和亚诺希·费伦茨把纳吉·伊姆雷所写的下列几个文件转交给了米兰·格奥尔基耶维奇：“道德和伦理”、“一些迫切的问题”、“国际关系的五项基本原则”。从匈牙利司法部的公告中可以看出，这些文件对匈牙利政府机关是保守秘密的。这些文件详细地说明了纳吉·伊姆雷和他的集团的政治任务：用暴力推翻国家制度，同反对人民民主的力量结成同盟，废除华沙条约，把匈牙利交到帝国主义者的手中。
      （2）在1956年10月23日到11月4日期间，洛松齐·格佐受纳吉·伊姆雷的委托，曾五次去到南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆，在那里同当时的大使达利博尔·索尔达蒂奇和当时的南斯拉夫大使馆参赞奥斯曼·迪克奇进行了会谈。在进行这些会谈时，索尔达蒂奇大使索取了并得到了国家机密情报。他根据这些情报同洛松齐讨论了进一步要做的事情，公开地干涉了匈牙利的内政。
      （二）南斯拉夫政府对司法部公告中的这样一段话表示怀疑，即“纳吉·伊姆雷、洛松齐·格佐和其他人则从南斯拉夫大使馆发布指示，命令继续进行武装反抗，组织使生活陷于瘫痪的罢工，重新组织秘密颠复活动”，接着，“他们在南斯拉夫大使馆里，曾经通过吉梅什·米克洛什和其他同谋者”同布达佩斯中央工人委员会、“自由欧洲”电台建立联系，并且甚至出版了新的秘密报纸“10月23日”。
    可是事实如下：
      （1）躲在南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆中的匈牙利人1956年11月5日在纳吉·伊姆雷的领导下成立了“执行委员会”，同索尔达蒂奇大使及其他一些特地为此从贝尔格莱德来到布达佩斯的高级官方人士进行了一系列会谈。这个委员会通过南斯拉夫大使馆的人员从大使馆内向残存在市内的阴谋集团成员们发出了继续进行反革命阴谋的指示。例如，1956年11月10日坦措什·加博尔受纳吉·伊姆雷的委托，通过大使馆的一个人员而把文件偷送给纳吉·巴拉日、吉梅什·米克洛什和亚当·捷尔吉。他们根据这个文件中的原则和指示开始组织非法的
  “匈牙利民主独立运动”，其目的在于推翻国家制度。这个文件是出版“10月23日”秘密报纸的开端。“10月23日”是纳吉·伊姆雷分子所建立的“执行委员会”的机关报，由吉梅什·米克洛什任主编。这个报纸号召举行罢工和进一步进行有组织的叛国活动。
      （2）洛松齐·格佐11月5日用大使馆的电话同前独立小农党右翼首领之一泊尔台·蒂瓦达尔谈话，指示他和别的右翼政客们一起逃往外国，他们将在那里同纳吉·伊姆雷的阴谋集团汇合，并一同反对工农革命政府。
      （3）根据纳吉·伊姆雷的指示，11月8日法泽卡什·捷尔吉在大使馆的帮助下，通过贝尔格莱德“政治报”驻布达佩斯记者尤留斯·久卡和贝尔格莱德“战斗报”驻布达佩斯记者加弗洛·阿尔特曼从大使馆给“自由欧洲”电台发消息。该电台立即发表了这个消息。
      （4）纳吉·伊姆雷等人在大使馆协助下，首先通过南斯拉夫记者尤留斯·久卡和加弗洛·阿尔特曼同反革命工人委员会建立了联系。
     （5）纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者通过南斯拉夫大使馆获得了关于合法的国家机构镇压反革命的指示和计划的情报，并于1956年11月14日在大使馆的要求下制订了夺取政权的新政治纲领和策略。
      （三）大使馆的一些工作人员和上述两名南斯拉夫记者一起于1956年11月—12月间，甚至后来在纳吉·伊姆雷和他的集团离开大使馆以后，仍旧经常干涉匈牙利内政。
    例如这些人在没有通知匈牙利当局和没有取得匈牙利当局同意的情况下，乘坐南斯拉夫大使馆的有外国使馆用车编号的汽车，在贝劳扬尼斯工厂、匈牙利光学仪器厂、4月4日机器厂、克伦福尔德纺织厂、钢材厂和切佩尔工厂中散发了卡德尔1956年12月7日在联邦国民议会上的讲话。在这一讲话中，卡德尔反对工农革命政府，并主张反革命性质的所谓工人委员会执掌政权。
      （四）照会企图造成一种假象，似乎由于匈牙利司法机构在纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的案件中执行了法律的职责，匈牙利人民共和国政府就违背了什么诺言。根据已揭发了的事实，这种企图就不攻自破了。匈牙利人民共和国并未违背任何诺言。实际情况如下：
      （1）在答复这个认为南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆有权给纳吉·伊姆雷集团避难权的不可容忍的论点以前，应当提到这个集团是在什么情况下和以何种不正常的方式到达南斯拉夫大使馆的。1956年11月1日，纳吉·伊姆雷集团的一个全权代表同索尔达蒂奇大使在国会大厦中进行谈判，谈到该集团代表人物的家属可以搬到南斯拉夫大使馆去住。11月4日以后，某些有名的南斯拉夫人士说，纳吉·伊姆雷等人是为了躲避白色恐怖而逃到他们那里去的。与此相反，每个人都很清楚的事实是：由于工农革命政府的力量和被要求来援助的苏联军队的武装行动，当纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者到南斯拉夫大使馆去的时候，国内白色恐怖实际上已经基本上消除了。此外，该集团到南斯拉夫大使馆去的方式也是异常特殊的。11月3日夜里，南斯拉夫负责人士根据取得的机密情报，获悉工农革命政府和苏联军队将于11月4日晨向反革命发动联合反攻。当时，索尔达蒂奇大使便亲自打电话给纳吉·伊姆雷集团的领导人员说，贝尔格莱德要求他们立即行使避难权。该集团其他成员的聚集也是在索尔达蒂奇大使的直接指导下进行的。有人自南斯拉夫大使馆打电话给洛松齐·格佐家，以大使的名义要乌伊赫利·西拉尔德和哈拉斯提·山多尔两人到大使馆去。与此同时，文化专员米洛万诺夫叫坦措什·加博尔同家属一起到大使馆去，大使馆副武官约沃·伏克希洛维奇则把自己的住宅让给瓦沙尔赫利·米克洛什和艾尔多亨·彼得用，而且他们也的确就使用了它。大使馆人员的这些做法是特别严重的，因为11月3日，当白色恐怖时，有许多生命受威胁的、思想进步的、正直的爱国人士曾经想要在南斯拉夫大使馆寻求保护，但都遭到了拒绝。因此很明显，南斯拉夫大使馆并不是要拯救纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者免于白色恐怖，而是要保护他们不受最高政权——匈牙利政府的制裁。
      （2）毫无疑问，南斯拉夫大使馆将纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者召集在一起，让他们留在大使馆，并把这种做法说成似乎是给上述人员以避难权，这是南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆滥用外交特权。国际法并不承认外交代表机构有权给予避难权。在许多著名的国际法专家中，我们援引南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国外交国务主要法律顾问、南斯拉夫国际法学家米兰·巴尔托什博士所讲的话，他在一本1956年出版的书中写道：“今天我们不能说避难权是国际法的积极准则”（“国际公法”，1956年版，第460页）。因此，南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆以给予避难权来庇护纳吉·伊姆雷集团的行为是违背国际法的行为，是对外交特权的滥用，而且显然是对驻在国内政的干涉。
      （3）工农革命政府1956年11月只有过这样的诺言，即不因为到当时为止所了解的纳吉·伊姆雷集团成员们的行为而惩办他们。后来匈牙利政府同意该集团的成员们到罗马尼亚人民共和国去，这表明了匈牙利政府是完全的善意的。而同工农革命政府谈判的南斯拉夫人士当时则已经确切知道纳吉·伊姆雷和他的集团的活动的真正性质，但是他们对匈牙利政府隐瞒了这一点，并力图造成这样的假象：似乎纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者是被事件卷入反革命罪行的。他们想通过迫使正在同反革命进行生死斗争的工农革命政府达成协议来达到双重目的：一方面用这种方法来防止南斯拉夫干涉的事实的暴露；另一方面挽救纳吉·伊姆雷集团免受惩办。他们为了达到这一点，甚至曾企图迫使匈牙利政府同意让纳吉·伊姆雷集团送到南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国去。众所周知，匈牙利政府从来就没有承认过南斯拉夫大使馆在避难权问题上的观点，并且坚决拒绝了关于把纳吉·伊姆雷集团送到南斯拉夫去的建议。
    至于谈到对这些人的惩办，是因为纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的有组织的阴谋活动是由匈牙利刑事和司法机构逐步查明的。改组了的司法和刑事当局只能随着形势的巩固逐步地查清所发生过的事件、反革命叛乱的原因和参加反革命叛乱的各个人的活动。然而，在追查的过程中，早在1957年1月就不得不开始对一些人进行审讯。那些人曾经在1956年11月4日到22
  日期间同其他未被追究责任和未被起诉的人一起留在南斯拉夫大使馆里。匈牙利人民共和国刑事和司法机构在慎重周密的调查以后，于1958年1月28日由检察署对纳吉·伊姆雷和他的集团提出诉讼。根据检察官的起诉书，刑事法院在1958年2月6日首次开庭审讯。由于有了补充证据，早在1958年6月9日到15日期间，又进行了最高法院的秘密审讯，6月17日，匈牙利人民共和国司法部公布了关于6月15日宣判的众所周知的公告。通过这次审讯，法院揭发并证明了纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者在11月4日以前公开活动的真正背景和他们阴谋叛国活动的作用，以及11月4日以后他们在南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使馆内为继续其反革命行动而进行的尝试。法院作出了公正的判决。
      （五）这些无可争辩的事实表明，南斯拉夫照会中提出的、认为纳吉·伊姆雷和他的同谋者的审判案件同目前正在进行的关于南共纲领草案的争论有联系的说法也是错误的、不符合实际的。事实证明这个案件的判决就是1957年1月开始的法院审讯的终结。
    南斯拉夫照会中所认为纳吉·伊姆雷和他的集团所进行的刑事诉讼是对两国关系的一个严重的打击，这种说法也是不符合事实的。损害匈南关系的不是最高法院的判决，而是那些滥用外交特权、经常干涉我国内政的南斯拉夫官方人士异常严重的活动。
    根据上述事实，南斯拉夫照会中的这种说法也是令人奇怪的，即“南斯拉夫为稳定匈牙利的局势作了重大的、无私的努力”。当南斯拉夫政府领导人一方面在公开场合强调对匈牙利人民共和国和工农革命政府的友谊，另一方面，南斯拉夫的官方人士却保护并支持威胁匈牙利人民共和国国家制度的人。他们的这个照会为帝国主义对匈牙利发动的宣传攻势服务了。
    匈牙利政府最坚决地拒绝南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国驻布达佩斯大使馆的照会，并把它视为再次的、无理的干涉企图。但是匈牙利人民共和国政府强调，它今后仍愿意同南斯拉夫保持和进一步发展国家、经济、文化方面的关系。但是，这种关系必须建立在互不干涉内政的基础上。匈牙利政府的这种愿望究竟能实现多少，要取决于南斯拉夫今后的态度。
    匈牙利人民共和国驻贝尔格莱德大使馆趁此机会向南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处致意。
