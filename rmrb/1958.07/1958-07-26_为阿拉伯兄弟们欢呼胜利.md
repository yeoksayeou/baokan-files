    Hail the Victory of Our Arab Brothers
    Zheng Zhenduo
Fifty thousand people roar in unison: American and British aggressors, get out of Lebanon, get out of Jordan! The Arab people have severed the shackles of a hundred years, the Middle East is no longer a breeding ground for you to gain a foothold. Imperialists are at the end of their rope, like an oil lamp about to go out, still wanting to shine one last time. But the bluster of a paper tiger, how can it be mustered? The shabby attire of a bankrupt family cannot hide all the ugliness. The Arab people have stood up, and will never bow to the aggressors again. With one hand they wipe out the traitors and running dogs, riding camels, holding guns, with a heroic spirit reaching the heavens, unafraid of your posturing clowns. The Persian Gulf is filled with red clouds, the light of the torch of justice shines all over the fields of Iraq. The century-old wish has now been realized, to establish their own country, to protect it themselves. Get out of Lebanon, get out of Jordan! The Arab people's giant club, haven't you been beaten by it before? The entire Arab world is united like a giant, that giant is like a mountain, who dares to touch even one of its little fingers! Fifty thousand people roar in unison! The roar of fifty thousand people is as if from one mouth. Hail the victory of our Arab brothers, Arab brothers, the just cause, people all over the world extend a helping hand!

    为阿拉伯兄弟们欢呼胜利
    郑振铎五十万人齐怒吼：美英侵略者们滚出黎巴嫩，滚出约旦！阿拉伯人民已经斩断了百年来的枷杻，中东不再是你们立足潜踪的渊薮。帝国主义者们是日暮途穷，将熄的油灯，还想回光返照显一下身手。无奈纸老虎的威风，怎能抖擞，破落户的长衫遮不住百般丑。阿拉伯人民已经站起来，再不会向侵略者低首，一举手便扑灭了内奸、走狗，跨骆驼，执手枪，豪气迈牛斗，那怕你们那些装腔作势的小丑。波斯湾红霞满天，正义的火把的光明照遍伊拉克的田亩，百年的愿望如今实现了，建立起自己的国家，自己来护守。滚出黎巴嫩，滚出约旦！阿拉伯人民的巨棒，你们不是没曾被殴。整个阿拉伯，团结得像一个巨人，那巨人像座大山，谁敢动他一个小指头！五十万人齐怒吼！五十万人的吼声如出一口，为阿拉伯兄弟们欢呼胜利，阿拉伯兄弟们啊，正义的事业，全世界人民都伸
  出援手！
