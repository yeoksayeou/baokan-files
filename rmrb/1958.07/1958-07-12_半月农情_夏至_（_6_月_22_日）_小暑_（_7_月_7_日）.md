Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation
"Summer Solstice" (June 22nd) - "Minor Heat" (July 7th)

Before "Minor Heat," cotton in various regions, except for a small number of third-class seedlings, had begun to blossom successively. After the wheat harvest, all cotton-growing areas universally strengthened cotton field management. In Hubei Province, cotton fields had been weeded two to three times; cultivated once or twice; generally fertilized once, and partially fertilized twice; and universally treated for pests two to three times, with 40% of cotton fields treated more than three times. The vast majority of cotton-growing areas in Henan, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces also prominently focused on this production aspect during this period.

First-class cotton fields increased with the strengthening of field management. According to inspections in Hubei, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces in mid-to-late June, first-class and second-class cotton seedlings accounted for 80% to 90% of the total cotton field area. In Anyang and Tangyin counties of Henan, by the end of June, first-class cotton fields had seven to twelve fruiting branches, fourteen to twenty flower buds, and were growing vigorously, with early budding.

Oilseed crops such as peanuts, soybeans, flax, and sesame were still in the intensive field management stage during this half-month. Early-sown peanuts in various regions had entered the full flowering period, and late-sown peanuts had also begun to flower. Judging from the situation in some areas, the flowering period of peanuts this year was slightly earlier than in previous years. Agricultural cooperatives in peanut-producing areas of Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces were carrying out peanut field cultivation and fertilization.

Soybeans generally grew vigorously in various regions, and spring-sown soybeans had already flowered. A few areas in Jilin and other provinces discovered soybean aphids, but it was not serious.

Agricultural cooperatives in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and other places continued to strengthen field management of flax during this period. Early-planted, irrigated flax in various producing areas had flowered.

During this half-month, winter wheat in some regions with later seasons also matured successively. Xinjiang, Gansu, Liaoning, and other provinces and regions began to harvest winter wheat. The winter wheat harvest was also generally bountiful in these regions this year. In some areas of Xinjiang, the yield per unit area of winter wheat increased by 30%-40% compared to last year. Although winter wheat in southern Liaoning suffered from relatively severe drought this year, the harvest was generally good, and some production units achieved records of averaging four to five hundred jin of wheat per mu.

In order to increase the multiple cropping index, these winter wheat areas were seizing the time to plant various late autumn crops after the wheat harvest. In Xinjiang, corn had already been planted in early-harvested wheat fields, and Liaoning was planting vegetables, early-maturing corn, and seed potatoes in wheat fields.

In northern regions, spring wheat had mostly headed and was filling, and some was approaching maturity, promising a good harvest. According to the current growth situation of over 93,000 mu of spring wheat in Tuoketuo County, Inner Mongolia, it is estimated that both total output and yield per unit area will reach unprecedented records this year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu of the 920,000 mu of spring wheat in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu can reach 350 jin, and the yield of high-yield fields can reach over 600 jin. The spring wheat along the Liaohe River in Liaoning, which will soon be harvested, is also yielding better than last year.

In some spring wheat areas, diseases and insect pests occurred to varying degrees in mid-to-late June. These regions promptly launched campaigns to eliminate diseases and insect pests. After widespread spraying of pesticides, the development of wheat rust in the Hetao area of Inner Mongolia has been brought under control.

    半月农情
    “夏至”（6月22日）——“小暑”（7月7日）
    在“小暑”以前，各地的棉花除了少数三类苗以外，已陆续开花。各棉区在麦收以后普遍加强了棉田管理。湖北省的棉田已全部锄草二到三次；中耕一到二次；一般追肥一次，部分追肥二次；普遍治虫二到三次，40％棉田已防治三次以上。河南、江苏、河北、山西等省的绝大多数棉区，也在这个时期里突出地抓了这项生产。
    一类棉田随着田间管理的加强而增多了。据湖北、江苏、山东6月中、下旬检查，一类苗和二类苗的棉田占棉田总面积的80％到90％。河南安阳、汤阴等县到6月底，一类棉田已有果枝七——十二个，着蕾十四——二十个，生长茁壮，现蕾提早。
    花生、大豆、胡麻、芝麻等油料作物在这半个月里仍处在紧张的田间管理阶段。各地早播的花生已进入盛花期，晚播的也开始现花。从部分地区情况看，今年花生的开花期较往年略早。山东、河北等省的花生产区农业社，都在进行花生田的中耕、追肥。
    各地大豆一般生长茁壮，春播的已经开花。吉林等省的少数地区发现大豆蚜虫，但不严重。
    内蒙古、甘肃等地农业社，在这个期间继续加强对胡麻的田间管理。各产区早种的水地胡麻已开花。
    在这半个月里，一些季节较晚地区的冬麦也陆续成熟了。新疆、甘肃、辽宁等省区都开始收获冬麦。这些地区今年的冬麦也是普遍丰收。新疆一些地区冬麦的单位产量比去年提高了30％—40％。辽宁南部的冬麦，今年虽然受到较重的干旱，但是收成一般不错，一些生产单位出现平均每市亩产麦四、五百斤的纪录。
    为了增加复种指数，这些冬麦区都抓紧在收麦以后抢种上各种晚秋作物。新疆早收的麦田已播种了玉米，辽宁正在麦田里播种蔬菜、早熟玉米和作种用的马铃薯等。
    北部地区的春麦已大部抽穗、灌浆，部分接近成熟，丰收在望。内蒙古托克托县从九万三千多亩春麦目前生长情况估计，今年总产量和单位产量都会出现空前纪录。甘肃临夏回族自治州的九十二万亩春麦，预计一般田亩产量可到三百五十斤，丰产田可到六百斤以上。就要开始收割的辽宁辽河两岸的春麦，今年的收成也优于去年。
    部分春麦区在6月中、下旬发生不同程度的病害、虫害。这些地区都及时地开展了扑灭病虫害的战斗。内蒙古河套地区的春麦锈病，在普遍喷射药剂以后，已经控制住病情的发展。
