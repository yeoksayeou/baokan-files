Adding Momentum on Top of a Bumper Harvest
Qinghai Farmers Boost Efforts to Strive for Even Greater Harvests

(By our correspondent) The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's rural inspection team, based on the growth of crops, estimated yields, mobilized the masses to add "chips" (increase production targets), and plant red flags to improve field management, striving for an even greater harvest.

Qinghai's spring wheat, highland barley, potatoes, broad beans, and other grain crops are growing exceptionally well this year, so many farmers feel that completing the original production increase plan is not a problem. In response to this situation, the inspection team felt it was necessary to raise the targets. Therefore, in various places, they worked with commune cadres and experienced farmers to estimate yields in the fields, and based on the current growth of crops and the field management work that can be done as much as possible in the future, the yield was estimated at a level that could be actively strived for. During the yield estimation, some farmers said: "Spring wheat and highland barley have already flowered and are filling, the yield is set, it is impossible to add more 'chips'"; "The targets are at the top, it is difficult to add more." The inspection team mobilized the masses to do a detailed accounting, and calculated based on the number of plants, ears, and grains, explaining that the original targets of many fields were already not advanced. Growing crops is like a race, you need the stamina to sprint, and now is the time to maintain that stamina. Although the wheat crops in most areas have already flowered and are filling, a lot of fertilizer can still be applied, watered, and attention paid to prevent insect and animal pests and lodging, striving for full grains and reducing losses. As for areas with later sowing and crops such as potatoes and broad beans that are sown later, there is much that can be done in field management.

After universally estimating yields, adding "chips," and planting red flags, every county has high-yield townships, every township has high-yield cooperatives, and every cooperative has high-yield plots; high-yield fields are all planted with red flags, indicating the yield. These high-yield flags make the agricultural cooperatives feel both honored and responsible, and they have all assigned special personnel to manage them under contract, striving to break through the targets.

### 在丰收的基础上加码  青海农民鼓足干劲争取更大丰收

    在丰收的基础上加码
    青海农民鼓足干劲争取更大丰收
    本报讯  中共青海省委组织的农村检查团根据庄稼生长情况估产量，发动群众加筹码、插红旗，搞好田间管理，力争更大丰收。
    青海的春小麦、青稞、洋芋、蚕豆等粮食作物今年长得空前好，因而许多农民感到完成原订的增产计划不成问题。针对这种情况，检查团认为有必要提高指标。于是，在各地会同社干部、老农作田头估产，根据庄稼现在的生长情况和今后尽可能做到的田间管理工作，把产量估在能够积极争取实现的指标上。估产时，一些农民说：“春小麦和青稞都扬花灌浆了，产量也定了，再要加码不行”；“指标到顶了，再加难上难”。检查团发动群众算了细账，就庄稼的株数、穗数、粒数推算，说明许多田地的原来指标已经不先进。种庄稼好比赛跑，要有猛力冲刺的后劲，现在正是贯后劲的时候。目前大部地区的麦类作物虽已扬花灌浆，但还可以大量追肥、浇水，注意防止虫兽害和倒伏，争取籽粒饱满和减少损失。至于播种较晚的地区和洋芋、蚕豆等播种较晚的作物，田间管理工作更是大有可为。
    普遍估产量、加筹码、插红旗以后，县县有了高产乡，乡乡有了高产社，社社有了高产块；高产田都插了红旗，注明了产量。这些高产旗使农业社既感到光荣，又感到责任重大，都分配了专人包干管理，力争突破指标。
