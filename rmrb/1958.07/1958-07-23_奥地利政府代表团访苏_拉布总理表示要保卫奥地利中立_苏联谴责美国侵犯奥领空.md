    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 21st: An Austrian government delegation, headed by Chancellor Raab, arrived in Moscow by plane on the 21st for a visit.

    Welcoming them at the airport were Soviet leaders Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Kosygin, and others.

    Khrushchev and Raab delivered speeches at the airport.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to TASS, the Austrian government delegation, headed by Raab, began talks with the Soviet government delegation, headed by Khrushchev, in the Kremlin on the 22nd.

    On the same day, Raab also separately visited Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: According to TASS, Vienna, July 20th: Austrian Federal Chancellor Raab gave a statement to the All-Netherlands News Agency on the 19th regarding his visit to the Soviet Union.

    He said that the Austrian government delegation was undertaking the visit under very tense international political circumstances. His recent political visits to some countries and the upcoming visits, “are all in order to strengthen the kind of relationship that neutral Austria hopes to maintain with all countries in the world.”

    He also said, “Austria's neutrality and our efforts to engage in honest and, to the best of our ability, cooperation in easing international tensions, are reliable guarantees for the future peaceful development of our country and our people.”

    Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to TASS, Moscow, July 21st: In a note to the US government, the Soviet government resolutely condemned US military aircraft for violating Austrian airspace, and demanded an immediate cessation of such actions, which undermine Austria's neutrality as guaranteed by the Austrian State Treaty signed by the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States.

    The note pointed out that on July 16th and in the days that followed, US military aircraft flying from West Germany to the US aggression zones in the Middle East violated the airspace of the Republic of Austria. These illegal actions by the US government clearly violate the principles of international law and blatantly undermine the Austrian State Treaty, violating its own obligations under international treaties.

    The note further stated that despite the Austrian government's formal protests, US military aircraft continue to fly over Austria, a situation that indicates a premeditated act of deliberate sabotage of Austrian neutrality.

    The Soviet note was delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zaryubin to US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson on the 21st. Copies of the note were also sent to the British, French, and Austrian embassies. (Attached picture)

    奥地利政府代表团访苏
    拉布总理表示要保卫奥地利中立
    苏联谴责美国侵犯奥领空
    新华社莫斯科21日电  以拉布总理为首的奥地利政府代表团21日乘飞机到达莫斯科访问。
    到机场欢迎的有苏联领导人米高扬、赫鲁晓夫、柯西金等。
    赫鲁晓夫和拉布在机场上相继讲了话。
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社报道，以拉布为首的奥地利政府代表团22日在克里姆林宫开始同以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联政府代表团举行会谈。
    这一天，拉布还分别拜访了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫和部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    据新华社21日讯  据塔斯社维也纳20日讯：奥地利联邦总理拉布在19日就访问苏联向全荷通讯社发表了谈话。
    他说，奥地利政府代表团是在国际政治局势十分紧张的情况下进行访问的。他本人最近对一些国家的政治访问和即将进行的访问，
  “都是为了要加强中立的奥地利希望同世界上所有国家保持的那种关系”。
    他还说，“奥地利的中立和我们在缓和国际紧张局势方面进行诚实的和力所能及的合作的努力，是我国和我国人民今后和平发展的可靠保障。”
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联政府在给美国政府的一份照会里坚决谴责美国军用飞机侵犯奥地利领空，并且要求立即停止这种破坏由苏联、英国、法国、美国所签署的奥地利国家条约中所保证的奥地利中立的行动。
    照会指出，7月16日和以后的几天中从西德飞往美国在中近东的侵略区的美国军用飞机侵犯了奥地利共和国的领空。美国政府的这种非法行动显然地违反了国际法的原则，粗暴地破坏了奥地利国家条约，破坏了它自己根据国际条约所承担的义务。
    照会又说，尽管奥地利政府已提出正式的抗议，美国军用飞机仍然不停地在奥地利上空飞行，这种情况表明，这是预先筹划好的蓄意破坏奥地利中立的行动。
    苏联的照会已经由苏联外交部副部长查鲁宾在21日交给了美国驻苏联大使汤普逊。照会的副本同时也送给了英国、法国和奥地利的大使馆。（附图片）
