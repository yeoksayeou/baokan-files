Xinhua News Agency dispatch: American newspapers and magazines continue to publish articles admitting that the Anglo-American invasion of the Middle East is extremely unpopular, and the invaders are universally opposed and surrounded, falling into an unprecedentedly isolated situation.

    The "Washington Post" published an article by Drew Pearson on the 24th, admitting that the United States is currently in an unprecedentedly isolated position in the world. According to the author, American diplomats recently attempted to garner two-thirds of the votes in the United Nations for the US aggression in the Middle East, but found that this was "not an easy task."

    The author says that the reactions of some countries that were once friends and allies of the United States are as follows:

    Latin America – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela and Mexico are very cold. They say privately that the Good Neighbor Policy has become a series of visits by important Americans; they are disgusted with the smiling faces behind the champagne glasses when toasting to an empty policy. They pointed out that in the past they listened to the servants of the American delegation office in the United Nations and voting instructions. They told American diplomats that they hated voting according to the instructions of the State Department. An ambassador from a Latin American country said: "How can I explain to my people why we should vote in favor of the US Marines being stationed in a small country? And they believe that the US military occupies this country entirely to protect American oil."

    Europe – West Germany, the pillar of NATO, complained about American intervention in Lebanon. Norway, Denmark, and Belgium were angered. Although France supported the intervention, it was very unhappy because its approximately 1,800 troops were refused landing on the Beirut coast.

    Asia and Africa – Japan, which we consider to be our main ally in the Far East, is on the other side on the Lebanese issue. Saudi Arabia, which we are striving for, does not allow the United States to use the air base in Dhahran and refuses to transport oil to Jordan. Indonesia, India, and most Asian and African countries oppose the United States.

    Pearson concluded that this is why our prestige has declined. He said that in the past few days, some diplomats have told each other: We must cheer up and save the United States. We cannot let it lose face. It was very bad to make Britain and France look like weak countries after the Suez incident. We cannot let the same thing happen to the United States.

    The author said: All of the above is unpleasant to think about. But if Americans do not wake up and face the facts, they will make the mistake of burying their heads in the sand. These unpleasant facts show how much the prestige of the United States has been reduced.

    Pearson finally believes that the reason why the United States is in today's situation is because "the situation in the past ten months has clearly shown that the scientific and military advantages we once maintained are giving way to the country that can launch a nearly one-and-a-half-ton satellite into the sky and can test long-range intercontinental missiles as early as 1957... We have been talking big but with little strength. We have been talking about outer space, but we can only launch small satellites."

    The transformation of scientific and military advantages is certainly one of the reasons for the embarrassing situation of the United States, but Pearson has obviously ignored another important reason, that is, after the bankruptcy of the power policy, the American ruling group still ignores the reality, stubbornly implements the aggression policy, and brazenly launches the aggression against Lebanon, threatening and intimidating Arab countries. This blatant piratical behavior has aroused widespread anger in world opinion, causing American aggressors to fall into an unprecedentedly isolated and difficult situation.

    Pearson finally suggested that American policy should have "foresight" and "should not rely on scaring and empty talk."

    He said, "The whole world now knows that we must painfully re-evaluate our own brinkmanship policy. One policy we may have to re-evaluate is our policy of monitoring the other side of the earth -- which is equivalent to Russia sending troops to land near our borders with Nicaragua, Guatemala or Mexico."

    The latest issue of the American "Time" magazine, published on the 28th, also admitted in an article titled "Reactions Around the World" that the American invasion of Lebanon was not supported.

    The article said that the world is treating the landing of American troops in Lebanon with memories, fear, and unease. All the countries that have been occupied (which account for a large proportion of the world's population) recalled the past, and even those Latin American, Asian, and African countries that usually stand on the side of the West have doubts. Those who believe that American intervention will increase the danger of war in the Middle East feel fear; while those who believe that the United States is taking the wrong way to support the wrong forces in the Middle East feel uneasy.

    The article talked about how people view the consistency of the United States and Britain in this action in the Middle East. It said that a Briton who has always opposed the Suez Canal incident said: "At least the United States has now been found to be as drunk as we are in a ditch."

    The article went on to talk about some reactions among the allies of the United States. It pointed out that left-wing members of the British Labour Party condemned the American military action in Lebanon. Even the West German government blamed the United States for failing to notify its NATO allies in advance, as had been informally agreed by the North Atlantic Group after the Suez incident.

    When talking about the attitude of Asian and African countries, the article pointed out that India, Indonesia, and Ghana all demanded that American troops withdraw from Lebanon.

    From the facts admitted by the "Washington Post" and "Time" magazine, it can be seen that the American piratical behavior of invading the Middle East is being increasingly widely condemned. This growing pressure of world opinion is precisely the important reason that forces the American ruling group not to refuse the summit conference.

### 侵略者发现自己掉在沟里  美报刊承认美国处境狼狈空前孤立

    侵略者发现自己掉在沟里
    美报刊承认美国处境狼狈空前孤立
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国的报纸和杂志继续发表文章，承认美英侵略中东的行动极其不得人心，侵略者众叛亲离、四面楚歌，陷入空前孤立的境地。
      “华盛顿邮报”24日刊载了德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇文章，承认美国目前在世界上处于空前孤立的地位。据作者说，最近美国外交家们曾在联合国里企图为美国在中东的侵略行为招徕三分之二的票数，但是，发现这“不是一件容易的事”。
    作者说，某些曾经一度是美国的朋友和盟国的国家反应如下：
    拉丁美洲——阿根廷、巴西、智利、委内瑞拉和墨西哥很冷淡。它们私下说，睦邻政策变成了美国要人进行的一系列访问；它们厌恶了为一个空洞的政策而干杯时在香槟酒杯后面的笑脸。它们指出，它们过去听从联合国美国代表团办公室的仆人们的召唤和投票指示。它们告诉美国外交家说，它们讨厌根据国务院的指示来投票。一位拉丁美洲国家大使说：“我怎么可能向我国人民解释，为什么我们应该投票赞成美国海军陆战队驻到一个小国家去呢？并且他们认为美军占领这个国家完全是为了保护美国石油。”
    欧洲——北大西洋组织的支柱西德埋怨美国干涉黎巴嫩。挪威、丹麦和比利时被激怒了。虽然法国是支持干涉的，可是它非常不高兴，因为它的大约一千八百名军队在贝鲁特海岸被拒绝登陆。
    亚洲和非洲——我们认为是我们在远东主要盟国的日本，在黎巴嫩问题上站在另外一边。我们所争取的沙特阿拉伯，不允许美国使用在扎赫兰的空军基地并且拒绝运石油给约旦。印度尼西亚、印度和大多数亚非国家都反对美国。
    皮尔逊据此得出结论说，我们的威信为什么下降了。他说在过去几天，某些外交人士彼此相告说：我们必须振作精神来挽救美国。我们不能让它丢面子。使英国和法国在苏伊士事件以后表现得像弱国是非常不好的。我们不能使同样的事情发生在美国身上。
    作者说：上述这一切想起来是令人不愉快的。但是，如果美国人不觉醒过来面对事实，他们将犯把头埋在沙里的错误。这些不愉快的事实表明，美国的威信已经有了多么大的降低。
    皮尔逊最后认为，美国所以陷于今天的处境，是因为“过去十个月的情况已经清楚表明，我们一度保持的科学和军事优势正在让位给那个能够把将近一吨半重的人造卫星发射到天空去并且能够早在1957年就试验远程洲际导弹的国家……我们一直是讲大话而力量却很小。我们一直在大谈其外层空间，但是却只能发射小小的人造卫星。”
    科学和军事优势的转变，固然是美国处境狼狈的一个原因，但是，皮尔逊显然忽略了另外一个重要原因，这就是，美国统治集团在实力政策破产之后，仍然无视现实，顽固地执行侵略政策，悍然发动对黎巴嫩的侵略，威胁和恫吓阿拉伯国家。这种明目张胆的海盗行为，激起世界舆论的广泛愤怒，使美国侵略者陷于空前孤立和进退两难的窘境。
    皮尔逊最后献策说，美国的政策要有“远见”，“不能依靠吓唬和空谈”。
    他说，“全世界现在已经知道，我们必须对我们自己的边缘作风政策进行忍痛的重新估价。我们可能不得不重新估价的一个政策是我们的监视地球另外一边的世界的政策——这种政策就相当于俄国派军队在我们和尼加拉瓜、危地马拉或墨西哥接壤的边境附近登陆的政策。”
    28日出版的最新一期美国“时代”周刊在题为“世界各地的反应”的一篇文章里也承认，美国侵略黎巴嫩的行动得不到支持。
    文章说，世界各地以回忆、恐惧和不安的心情对待美军在黎巴嫩的登陆。所有曾经被占领的国家（它们占世界人口的很大一部分）回忆起往事，甚至在通常站在西方这边的那些拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲国家也产生了怀疑。那些认为美国干涉要使中东战争的危险增加的国家，则感到恐惧；而那些认为美国正在采取错误的方式支持中东的错误的力量的国家，则感到不安。
    文章谈到人们是怎样来看待美国和英国这一次在中东的行动一致的。它说，一直反对苏伊士运河事件的一个英国人说：“至少美国现在已经被发觉同我们一样醉醺醺地掉在一个沟里了。”
    文章接着谈到在美国的盟国中的一些反应。它指出，英国工党左翼议员谴责美国出兵黎巴嫩的行动。甚至西德政府也责备美国没有像苏伊士事件以后北大西洋集团非正式商定的那样，事先通知它的北大西洋盟国。
    在谈到亚非国家的态度时，文章指出，印度、印度尼西亚和加纳都要求美国军队撤出黎巴嫩。
    从“华盛顿邮报”和“时代”周刊承认的事实可以看出，美国侵略中东的海盗行为正在遭到日益广泛的谴责。世界舆论这种越来越大的压力，正是迫使美国统治集团不敢拒绝首脑会议的重要原因。
