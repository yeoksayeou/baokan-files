    Today of Myriad Changes
    Ba Jin
    In these days, as I read the daily newspapers, or listen to people speak, or go around to look at various places, I have this feeling: it's like living in a fairy tale world, like I'm dreaming. When I talk to some acquaintances, they say they feel the same way. We often say "myriad changes," but it was just an empty phrase in the past. Now I fully understand the meaning of these four words. Our surroundings are indeed changing every day, every moment. People are changing, things are changing, and objects are changing. The relationships between people are also changing. These changes are more than myriad. You can't count them all, and you can't even begin to count, because you yourself are changing.
    Speaking of the big things, like thousands of blast furnaces rising from the ground, a mu of land yielding more than 5,000 jin of wheat, catching up with England in many aspects not in fifteen years, but in just a few short years; like drawing water up the mountains, leveling mountains, filling the seas... such things, we never even dreamed of in the past. Even fairytale writers wouldn't dare to imagine so much. In fairy tales, one cornucopia is already amazing. But today, how many cornucopias do we have! "We blow a breath, and the rolling rivers boil; we raise a hand, and the majestic mountains tremble!" How could fairytale writers imagine the spirit of the working people! As for what kind of appearance our motherland will have in the world a few years from now, even fairytale writers can't imagine it. The world in fairy tales is not so beautiful, nor so rich. In fairy tales, one miracle or even ten miracles is the limit, but in today's China, thousands upon thousands of miracles appear every day. The so-called "miracle" is something that was previously thought to be impossible for human beings. Today, there is nothing that the Chinese people cannot do. Today there are people who insist on doing things that people previously thought were impossible. They have indeed done it, and one exceeds the other, competing endlessly. The power of the collective has just begun to be exerted, and it has already produced so many amazing miracles. If the ancients could come alive and see today's world, they would surely be frightened and run away. They would think they had encountered gods. In their minds, many things today can only be done by gods.
    Many foreign gentlemen read reports about the brilliant achievements of the new China's construction and refuse to believe them. They still regard today's Chinese people as the "sick men of East Asia" from the past. On the one hand, they have been fooled by their "ancient people," and on the other hand, they are still dreaming of exploitation, hoping that time will flow backwards and the "good old days" will return. They use their old rules to measure the leaping progress of the new China, closing their eyes and refusing to admit the facts before them, sometimes even daydreaming, thinking that a round of clamoring can obliterate the existence of a great nation of 600 million people. In fact, it won't be long before they find themselves far behind the Chinese people. What they cannot do, the Chinese people have done. What they did with great effort, the Chinese people have done more and better. Their deceptive spells not only cannot frighten the Chinese people, but also cannot change their own destiny. It is not surprising that foreign gentlemen do not recognize the power of the Chinese working people who have stood up; what is strange is that a few Chinese people still believe in foreign stereotypes and are unwilling to admit everything that their compatriots have made with their own hands. They have given themselves a title: "experts." The greatest skill of these "experts" is that they do not believe in miracles, nor do they want to see others create miracles. They always believe that what has never happened in the past will not happen now or in the future. They have built four walls with past stereotypes and locked themselves inside. They cannot see the working people who have broken superstitions and broken stereotypes, creating miracles every day.
    Recently, Shanghai Guangci Hospital treated a patient with burns covering 84.5% of his body. According to foreign stereotypes, this patient could only live for three days at most. During the consultation, the top surgeons, based on foreign medical literature, determined that he would die soon. But after careful treatment by the hospital, the patient has lived for a month and is getting better day by day. There have been several such medical miracles in several hospitals in Shanghai. This shows that as long as superstitions are broken and routines are broken, the Chinese people can do what foreigners have not done today.
    On a smaller scale, when you get on a streetcar, someone will greet you, hold your child for you, and bring you newspapers to read; if you lose something, the people's police will carry it on their shoulders and deliver it to your door; when you go to the hospital to see a doctor, the doctor will treat you as a friend or relative; you have forgotten when you last repaired your watch, but the store sends a letter inquiring earnestly whether the watch is running well... Any matter, large or small, makes you feel the mutual care of people in the new society, feel the warmth of a harmonious family, and feel the relationships between people becoming closer and closer every day.
    People see these big and small changes every day, and feel more and more deeply this new relationship between people. These big and small changes, this new relationship, needless to say, encourages people's courage to move forward. When everything around a person changes, it will of course promote his change. Some people change slowly, some change little. They are still accustomed to using old minds to see new things, and they will feel that all this is incomprehensible. They stubbornly cling to bourgeois individualism to measure everything, and of course they will run into walls everywhere. There is a most common phenomenon in the new society: not for oneself, but for everyone. Where can there be personal interests without the interests of the masses? In a great era of rapid change, what can a person do? Individuals will disappear at any time, but the great collective of 600 million people will exist forever and prosper. Some people also believe in their own little bit of "knowledge," thinking that it is still something amazing today. I mentioned the Guangci Hospital incident earlier. At that consultation, a great expert expressed this meaning: my presence is better than any medicine. I determine that the patient will die, and no one is responsible. But contrary to the expert's expectations, the patient stubbornly refused to die. This shows that personal knowledge is nothing compared to the wisdom of the masses.
    Today is no longer an era where a few people monopolize knowledge. Nor is it an era for intellectuals to put on airs and flaunt their qualifications. That little bit of so-called "knowledge" has become a burden for intellectuals. The older the qualifications and the greater the airs, the heavier the burden. The heavier the burden, the slower you walk. Today, 600 million people are racing against time. To participate in this long-distance race, you cannot carry a heavy burden. Therefore, when we intellectuals study the general line, we all have this feeling: the times have changed too much, and we cannot keep up; the times are running too fast, and we cannot catch up. We cannot change much, and we cannot run fast, so we can only lag far behind. After falling behind, we still want to use the sign of "comfortably residing in the middle reaches" to comfort ourselves. In fact, in this era, there are no "middle reaches" where you can "live comfortably." Because the times cannot stop advancing because of you, and the power of the masses will also push the times to run faster. Today's "middle reaches" may be tomorrow's "lower reaches." Once you fall into the "lower reaches," you will inevitably be abandoned by the times. You cannot blame the times for being ruthless; you can only blame yourself for not seeking to improve. There is of course more than one reason why intellectuals cannot run fast. The biggest reason is that the burden they carry is too heavy. Only by opening the burden on your back and completely throwing away the dirty things one by one, is it possible to run with the times and never fall behind!

### 变化万千的今天

    变化万千的今天
    巴金
    在这些日子，我翻读每天的报纸，或者听人们讲话，或者到各处去看看，我都有这样一种感觉：好像活在童话的世界里面一样，好像在做梦一样。我跟一些熟人谈起，他们也说有同感。我们平日常说“变化万千”，从前不过是一句空话，现在我才充分了解这四个字的意义。我们的周围的确天天在变，时时在变，人在变，事在变，物也在变。人与人的关系也在变。这样的变化何止万千，你要数也数不清，而且也无法数，因为连你自己也在变。
    从大的讲起，像万座高炉平地起，一亩田收小麦五千多斤，在好些方面不要十五年，只要短短的几年功夫就赶上英国；像把水引上山，把山削平，把海填满……这样的事，过去连做梦也没有想到。就是编童话的人也不敢想得太多。在童话里一个聚宝盆已经很了不起了。我们今天有的聚宝盆岂止千千万万！“我们吹口气，滚滚江河沸翻；我们一举手，巍峨大山胆寒！”劳动人民的这种气魄岂是编童话的人所能想像的！至于几年以后，我们的祖国将以什么样的面貌在世界上出现，也不是编童话的人想像得到的。童话里的世界没有这样美，也没有这样富。在童话里，一个奇迹甚至十个奇迹就到了止境了，在今天的中国，每天都有上千上万的奇迹出现。所谓“奇迹”就是从前认为人力所办不到的。今天再没有中国人办不到的事情了。今天就有这样的人，他们偏偏要办到从前人们认为办不到的事。他们的确办到了，而且一个超过一个，比来比去，没有止境。集体的人的力量才开始在发挥，就已经产生了这么多的惊人的奇迹。要是古人能够活起来看一看今天的世界，他们一定会吓得逃跑，他们会以为遇到了神仙了。在他们脑子里今天的许多事情只有神仙才做得出来。
    很多外国的绅士读到关于新中国建设上辉煌成就的报道不肯相信，他们还把今天的中国人当作从前的“东亚病夫”。他们一方面上了他们的“古人”的当，另一方面他们自己还在做着剥削的好梦，妄想年光倒流，过去的“好日子”重来。他们用他们的陈规来衡量新中国的飞跃的进步，闭上眼睛不肯承认摆在面前的事实，有时甚至痴心妄想，以为一阵叫嚣就可以抹煞六亿人民大国家的存在。其实并不要等多久的时间，他们就会发见自己远远地落在中国人的后面。他们做不到的事中国人做到了。他们费了大力才做到的事，中国人做得更多，更好。他们那些骗人的符咒不但吓不倒中国人民，也改变不了他们自己的命运。外国绅士们不认识站起来的中国劳动人民的力量，这是无足怪的；可怪的倒是有少数中国人到现在还迷信外国的陈规，不愿意承认自己同胞用两只手做出来的一切。他们给自己起了一个封号：“专家”。这些“专家”最大的本领就是不相信奇迹，也不愿意看见别人创造奇迹。他们始终认为过去不曾有过的事情现在和将来也不会有。他们用过去的陈规造成了四面墙，把自己关在里面。他们看不见破除了迷信打破了陈规的劳动人民天天在创造奇迹。
    最近上海广慈医院治疗了一个烫伤面积达84.5％的病人。按照外国的陈规，这个病人最多只能活三天。在会诊时候，第一流的外科专家根据外国的医学文献，断定他很快地就要死亡。但是经过医院的细心治疗，病人已经活了一个月，而且一天一天地好起来。这种医学上的奇迹在上海几个医院里就有好几件。这就说明只要破除了迷信打破了常规，外国人没有做到的事今天的中国人都能做到。
    再从小的方面说，你踏上电车就会有人招呼你，替你抱小孩，拿书报给你看，你丢了东西，人民警察会挑着担子送上门来招领；你到医院看病，医生会把你当作朋友或亲人看待；你已经忘记了自己什么时候修理过钟表，店里却来信殷勤地询问钟表是否走得很好。……任何大大小小的事都使你感觉到新社会中人们彼此的关心，感觉到和睦家庭中的温暖，感觉到人与人的关系一天一天地密切。
    人们天天见到这些大的、小的变化，而且越来越深地感觉到这种人与人之间的新的关系。这些大小的变化，这种新的关系不用说鼓舞了人们前进的勇气。一个人四周的一切都改变了，当然会促成他的改变。有些人变得慢，变得少，他们还习惯用旧脑筋看新事物，他们会觉得这一切都不可以理解。他们死抱着资产阶级的个人主义去衡量一切，当然会处处碰壁。新社会里有一个最普遍的现象，就是：不为自己为大家。离开了众人的利益，哪里还有个人的利益呢？在一个一日千变万变的大时代中，一个人究竟能够做出什么事情？个人随时都会消灭，但是六亿人民这个伟大的集体却要永远存在，而且兴盛繁荣。也有人迷信自己的那一点点“知识”，认为在今天还是了不起的东西。我在前面讲过广慈医院的事情，在那次会诊的时候就有一位大专家表示过这样的意思：我来了比用什么药都好。我断定病人要死，谁也就没有责任了。但是出乎专家意外的是病人偏偏不死。这就说明个人的知识跟群众的智慧比起来，实在算不得什么。
    今天已经不是少数人独占知识的时代了。也不是知识分子摆资格拿架子的时代了。那一点点所谓“知识”已经成了知识分子的包袱。资格越老、架子越大的人背的包袱也越重。包袱背得越重，走起路来也就越慢。今天六亿人民都在跟时间赛跑。要参加这个长距离赛跑，就不能够背着重的包袱。所以我们知识分子在学习总路线的时候，都有这样的感觉，时代变化太大，自己跟不上；时代跑得太快，自己追不上。变又变不大，跑又跑不快，只好远远地落在后面。落了后还想用“甘居中游”的招牌来安慰自己。其实在这个时代里，并没有可以让你“安居”的“中游”。因为时代不能因为你而停止前进，而且群众的力量还要推动时代跑得更快。今天的“中游”可能就是明天的“下游”，一旦落到“下游”就难免要被时代抛弃。不能怨时代无情，只能怪自己不求上进。知识分子跑不快的原因当然不止一个，最大的原因就是背的包袱太重。只有把背上的包袱打开，将一件一件的肮脏东西完全丢光，才有可能跟着时代跑，永不掉队！
