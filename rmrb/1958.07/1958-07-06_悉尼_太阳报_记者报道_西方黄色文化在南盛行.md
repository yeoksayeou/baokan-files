Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Sydney: The Sydney "Sun" recently published a lengthy article by its London-based reporter, Zell Rabin, after a visit to Yugoslavia. The article clearly shows the prevalence of Western bourgeois culture in Yugoslavia and its corruption of the Yugoslav people.

Rabin's article mentioned that under the rule of the Tito clique, the new generation in Yugoslavia has no interest in Marxism, but the British and French cultural reading rooms there are crowded with people, and Western magazines are selling well. Rabin said that in the capital's hotels there are "dances by the most talented belly dancers." In addition to belly dancing, American swing dancing is also popular in Yugoslavia. American films and surrealist works are popular in Yugoslavia, and the uncensored British sex history "Lady Chatterley's Lover" is prevalent.

Rabin said that the United States is filming in Yugoslavia with the full cooperation of the Tito government. He said that one day a group of film actors, after eating a sumptuous lunch of chicken and wine, threw the leftovers to a group of ragged children waiting outside. "The way they devoured these leftovers was a stark reminder that poverty still exists among the peasant class."

    悉尼“太阳报”记者报道
    西方黄色文化在南盛行
    新华社4日讯  悉尼消息：悉尼“太阳报”最近刊登了这家报纸驻伦敦的记者泽尔·雷宾在访问南斯拉夫后写的一篇长文。从文章中可以清楚地看到西方资产阶级文化在南斯拉夫的盛行及其对南斯拉夫人民的腐蚀。
    雷宾的文章谈到，在铁托集团的统治下，南斯拉夫新的一代对马克思主义毫无兴趣，那里的英国和法国的文化阅览室里却挤满了人，西方杂志畅销。雷宾说，在首都饭店有“最有天才的肚皮舞舞蹈家的舞蹈”，南斯拉夫现在流行的舞蹈除了肚皮舞以外，还有美国的摇摆舞。南斯拉夫流行着美国电影和超现实主义的作品，并且充斥着未经删节的英国的性史“恰特利夫人的情人”一书。
    雷宾说，美国正在铁托政府的充分合作下，在南斯拉夫拍摄影片。他说，有一天一批电影演员吃完了一顿有鸡、有酒的丰盛午餐以后，把吃剩下来的东西扔给了一群在外边等待的衣衫褴褛的孩子们，“他们吃这些剩下来的东西时的那种狼吞虎咽的样子，冷酷地提醒人们在农民阶层中仍然存在着贫困”。
