Street Competition: Mutual Learning, Mutual Promotion
Tianjin Technical Innovation Sets Up a Ring

(Our report) Reporters Zhao Yuxin and Lü Suxuan report:

        A ring is set up in the street center,
        Many heroes come to compete;
        The technical revolution is leaping forward,
        Flowers of wisdom bloom everywhere.

This is a poem written by a worker describing the Tianjin Technical Innovation Competition. Since the middle of last month, various districts in Tianjin have successively adopted the method of street competitions to mobilize workers, shops, handicraft cooperatives, institutions, schools, and even street residents throughout the district to display the achievements of their implementation of the General Line, the latest products, major inventions and creations, and real objects, models, charts, and comic strips of advanced individuals and deeds on the streets, allowing the people of the city to conduct an unprecedented grand review. Everyone strives for first place, comparing speed, quantity, quality, and economy, comparing measures, and comparing implementation, to see who leads in the technical revolution and production leap forward arena. At the same time as the competition, they also promote the communist spirit, mutually cooperate and support each other, and promote the realization of technical innovation and the common improvement of production. Facts have proved that this is an effective way to thoroughly implement and publicize the General Line, and also a good method to mobilize the masses to participate in the technical revolution.

A Riot of Color and a Gleam of Treasures
The competition is actually a grand review of the city's technical innovation, industrial production, and various tasks in the first half of the year, in a form that the masses like to see and hear. Most of the more than 300,000 technical innovation proposals that the city's employees have implemented in recent months and the more than 2,000 new products that have been successfully trial-produced have been moved to the venue, and many creators serve as guides to conduct on-site operation demonstrations. Among them are huge tractors and cars, small medical electric motors the size of a fist, 350-count yarn thinner than silk, ingenious resistance mosquito-killing lamps, and novel blind-person pathfinders; as well as the great achievements of employees in inventing and creating new tools and equipment, and adopting new technologies, new designs, new materials, and improving labor conditions. The new products at the conference are dazzling, and the new creations are everywhere, it is truly a "riot of color and a gleam of treasures."

These inventions and creations come from large factories with more than 2,000 people, small factories with 20 to 30 people, and also from handicraft cooperatives and non-production departments such as shops and banks with simple equipment. In order to move the factory's new creations to the conference for competition, the Dazhong Iron Factory trial-produced the automatic charging machine eleven days ahead of schedule than originally planned, changing manual operation to automation and increasing production efficiency by 34 times. The Heping District Third Electrical Handicraft Cooperative displayed at the conference their newly created electric spark large drilling machine that can increase work efficiency by 30 times, a universal lathe that can mill, spin, grind, and drill, and a semiconductor solar battery. A spectator from Nankai District once praised the competition like this:

    Red flags cover the sun, gongs and drums fill the sky,
    Look!
    Immortals are competing in the human world.
    Comparing drive, Wu Song bows his head,
    Comparing skills, Lu Ban lowers his head,
    Comparing wisdom, Kong Ming is still inferior;
    "Native" experts turn stones into gold,
    Enraging "John Bull" to death.

Everyone Competes to Be the First
Who is the Hero, See Today
After the start of the competition, who is advanced and who is backward is clearly displayed in the street, which has stimulated the heroic spirit of the masses to strive for the first place and promoted the mass technical revolution movement. Advanced units strive to be more advanced; units that originally thought they were advanced were greatly surprised to see the leaps and bounds of others, and only then realized that they would fall behind if they did not speed up; units that were originally backward also decided to catch up with the advanced. Many employees couldn't wait for the factory to organize collective visits and ran to the competition venue after get off work; some people even visited repeatedly several times, humbly learning and pondering, and then conducted innovation research after returning to the factory. The textile industry once circulated the saying that "textile is always a thread, and changing to death is also a shuttle coming and going," and employees had conservative thoughts that there was nothing to reform. After visiting the conference and seeing double-shuttle looms, etc., their horizons were broadened and they found the direction of technical innovation. Meng Guanghe and other five young workers from the First Silk Weaving Factory researched and developed a double-shuttle silk weaving machine after returning to the factory, which can automatically reverse the shuttle and automatically change the box, which is a major innovation in the silk industry.

Dong Shaohua of You Shun store of the Nankai District Catering Company created a rolling knife to replace manual cutting of fried dough twist noodles, while Zhang Baolin of Yong Ju Xing store was superstitious about his skills, believing that reforming tools would not be faster than him. The two competed on the spot, each using 30 pounds of fried dough twist noodles. As a result, Dong Shaohua used a rolling knife to cut the noodles evenly and easily, while Zhang Baolin was exhausted, sweating profusely, and his arms were shaking, and some of the noodles were not up to standard. Only then did Zhang Baolin realize the importance of technical innovation. A worker in Chengxiang District wrote such a poem:

    Walk around the exhibition,
    My thoughts are greatly liberated.
    Ostrich ink is fragrant,
    Surpassing the American Parker King,
    Flour sacks have no seams,
    Compressed glass is as strong as steel.
    Ten miles along the streets north and south,
    Novel and rare products are lined up in two rows,
    Every piece is made by workers,
    The more I look, the brighter my heart becomes.
    Determined to create new varieties,
    Hurriedly rush back to the factory,
    Making new models overnight,
    Send them to the conference tomorrow.

The Spirit of Collaboration is Universally Promoted
The Wisdom of the Masses Shines Brightly
The competition arena is next to the collaboration arena. On the one hand, it is competition, and on the other hand, it is collaboration. The competition is the unity of opposites between the two. It not only has the contradiction and struggle of competition, but also has the cooperative methods to solve contradictions; it not only stimulates the revolutionary heroic spirit of the vast masses not to yield to each other, but also educates the masses with the communist spirit of comradely unity and mutual assistance. Many units wrote out in big-character posters the materials they could support others with, and also posted the difficulties that needed help from others. During the competition, more than 200 units in Hongqiao District took out more than 1,000 units of machine tools, electric motors, water pumps, transformers, and textile machines, nearly 300 tons of steel and pig iron, and more than 60,000 square meters of real estate for mutual support. The Dazhong Iron Factory lacked an electric drill, and as soon as the big-character poster requesting support was posted, five factories immediately sent it. The Second Cultural and Educational Production Cooperative wanted to manufacture plastic biogas pipes needed by the countryside, but lacked an extruder and could not conduct trial production. They had contacted seven factories one after another, but these factories were unable to undertake it because their production tasks were full. When they sought help on the collaboration stage, the Zhongxing Machine Factory immediately decided to take the time to produce the extruder, but there was no model, and it could not be made without sand casting. The Second Cultural and Educational Production Cooperative posted a second big-character poster for help, and that night received calls from the First Wood Model Factory and the Casting Pot Factory, stating that they must complete the modeling and sand casting as soon as possible.

At the conference where employees competed and collaborated at the same time, everyone also exchanged a lot of valuable technical experience and improved together. Combining on-site visits, the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party organized experience exchange meetings for many industries and types of work such as fitter, foundry worker, lathe worker, and textile worker, concentrating the wisdom of the masses and solving some difficult technical problems.

The General Line is Deeply Rooted in the Hearts of the People
Through the competition, the technical revolution movement has been further promoted, and the General Line has been deeply publicized. After visiting, the employees of many factories studied new technologies day and night. In Chengxiang District alone, there were 784 new products and patterns put into production in early July, more than double the total in the first half of the year. During the competition, the employees of Nankai District put forward more than 150,000 technical innovation proposals, and more than 47,000 were implemented. The highest record of daily output in June of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory exceeded 1.4 times the beginning of the year. During the competition, the Changcheng Rubber Factory fought for one night and realized 50 major innovation measures. The automatic stretching equipment created by worker Feng Jingquan solved the key problem of small stretching rate that had not been solved for many years, and could save the country more than 15,700 taels of gold throughout the year. After watching the competition, everyone was in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. (Attached picture)

    街头比武　互相学习　互相促进
    天津技术革新摆擂台
    本报讯　记者赵玉昕、吕素瑄道报：
        街道中心摆擂台，
        多少英雄比武来；
        技术革命大跃进，
        智慧之花遍地开。
    这是一个工人描述天津市技术革新比武大会所写的诗句。自上月中旬以来，天津市各区陆续采取了街头比武的办法，发动全区的工人、商店、手工业社、机关、学校以至街道居民，把自己贯彻执行总路线的成就，把最新的产品、重大的发明创造、先进人物和事迹的实物、模型、图表、连环画摆到街头，让全市人民进行一次史无前例的大检阅。大家都以力争第一的精神，大比多快好省、比措施、比实现，在比技术革命、生产跃进的擂台上看谁家领先。比武同时，并发扬了共产主义精神，互相协作支援，促进技术革新的实现和生产的共同提高。事实证明，这是深入贯彻宣传总路线的一种有效形式，也是发动广大群众参加技术革命的一种良好方法。
    百花争艳万宝放光
    比武大会实际上是运用群众喜见乐闻的形式，对全市上半年来的技术革新、工业生产和各项工作的一次大检阅。全市职工在近几个月来已实现的三十多万件技术革新的建议，新试制成功的两千多种新产品，大部分搬到会场，并有很多创造人任讲解员，进行现场操作表演。其中有庞大的拖拉机、汽车，有小的像拳头那样的医疗上用的电动马达，有比蚕丝还细的350支纱，有精巧的电阻灭蚊灯，有新奇的盲人探路器；还有职工们发明创造的新工具、新设备和采用新的工艺技术、新设计、新材料、改善劳动条件等方面的巨大成就。大会上的新产品琳琅满目，新创造触目皆是，真是“百花争艳、万宝放光”。
    这些发明创造，有的出自两千人以上的大厂，有的出自二、三十人的小厂，也有的出自设备简陋的手工业社和商店、银行等非生产部门。大众铁工厂为了把本厂的新创造搬到大会上比武，比原计划提前十一天试制成功了自动上料机，把手工操作改成了自动化，使生产效率提高了三十四倍。和平区第三电气手工业社，在大会上摆出了他们新创造的可以提高工作效率三十倍的电火花大型钻孔机，能铣、能旋、能磨、能钻的万能车床和半导体太阳电池。南开区的一个观众，曾这样歌颂比武大会：
    红旗遮日，锣鼓喧天，
    看！
    神仙比武在人间。
    比干劲，武松拱手，
    比技巧，鲁班低头，
    比智谋，孔明还逊一筹；
      “土”专家点石成金，
    活活气死“约翰牛”。
    人人比武齐争先
    谁是英雄看今天
    比武大会开始后，谁先进，谁落后都清楚地摆在街头，它激发了群众力争第一的英雄主义气概，推动了群众性的技术革命运动。先进的单位争取更加先进；原来自以为先进的单位，看了人家的飞跃前进，不禁大吃一惊，这才知道自己如不快马加鞭就要落后了；原来落后的单位也决心迎头赶上先进。好多职工等不到厂里组织集体参观，一下班就跑到比武场上去；有些人竟反复参观好几次，虚心学习琢磨，回厂后就进行革新的研究。纺织业曾流传着“纺织总是一根线，改死也是一把梭子来回穿”，职工们存着没啥改革的保守思想，参观了大会后，看到双梭织布机等等以后，眼界大开，找到了技术革新的方向。第一织绸厂的青工孟广和等五个人，回厂后就研究出一台双梭织绸机，能自动倒梭、自动换盒，是丝绸工业的一项重大革新。
    南开区饮食公司友顺门市部董少华创造了一个滚刀代替人工切餜子面，而永聚兴门市部的张宝林却迷信手艺，认为改革工具也不会比他快。两人在会场上当场各用三十斤炸餜子的面进行较量，结果董少华用滚刀均匀而且轻松地把面切完了，而张宝林已累得满头大汗，胳膊发抖，有的面还切的不合格。这时张宝林才认识到技术革新的重要意义。城厢区的一个工人写了这样的一首诗：
    展览会上走一趟，
    我的思想大解放。
    鸵鸟墨水香芬芳，
    超过美国派克王，
    面口袋儿没有缝，
    玻璃压缩坚如钢。
    街南街北十里路，
    新奇珍品排两行，
    件件都是工人造，
    越看心里越亮堂。
    决心创造新品种，
    急急忙忙赶回厂，
    连夜制造新模型，
    明天送给大会上。
    协作精神普遍发扬
    群众智慧大放光芒
    比武擂台紧挨着协作擂台，一方面是比武，一方面是协作，比武大会就是这两者的对立统一体。它既有比武的矛盾斗争，又有解决矛盾的协作方法；既激发了广大群众各不相让的革命英雄气概，又用同志式的团结互助的共产主义精神教育了群众。很多单位用大字报写出自己可以支援别人的物资，同时也贴出需要别人帮助解决的困难。红桥区的二百多个单位，在比武期间共拿出了机床、电动机、水泵、变压器、纺织机等一千多台，钢材、生铁近三百吨，房地六万多平方公尺，进行互相支援。大众铁工厂缺少一把电钻，要求支援的大字报一贴出，立即有五个厂送了来。第二文教生产合作社想制造农村需要的塑料沼气管，但缺少挤出机无法试制。他们曾先后联系过七个工厂，而这些工厂因为生产任务排满了，未能承担。当他们在协作台上求援时，中兴机器厂马上决定抽出时间生产挤出机，但没有模型，不经过翻砂还是作不成。第二文教生产合作社又贴出第二张求援的大字报，当夜就接到第一木型厂和铸锅厂的电话，表示一定要尽快完成制模和翻砂的活。
    职工们在一面比武一面协作的大会上，大家还相互交流了很多宝贵的技术经验，共同提高。中共各区区委结合现场参观，组织了钳工、铸工、车工、纺织等许多同行业、同工种的经验交流会，集中群众的智慧，解决了一些难以解决的技术问题。
    总路线深入人心
    通过比武大会，进一步推动了技术革命运动，并深入地宣传了总路线。许多厂的职工参观了以后，昼夜不停地钻研新技术。仅城厢区7月上旬投入生产的新产品、新花样就有七百八十四种，等于上半年总数的一倍多。南开区职工在比武大会期间，提出的技术革新建议有十五万多件，实现的有四万七千多件。第二印染厂6月份日产量的最高纪录竟超过年初的一点四倍。长城橡胶厂在比武大会期间，奋战一夜实现了五十项重大革新措施。工人冯景泉创造的自动伸长设备，解决了多年以来解决不了的伸长率小的关键问题，全年就可为国家节约一万五千七百多两黄金。人们看了比武大会，个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬。（附图片）
