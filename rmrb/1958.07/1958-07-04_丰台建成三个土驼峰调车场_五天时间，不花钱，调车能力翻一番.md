Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd—Fengtai Station employees built three "earthen hump" marshalling yards in five days, doubling the station's marshalling capacity and providing favorable conditions for resolving the current transport strain.

    Fengtai Station is a transport hub for the Beijing-Baotou, Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Hankou, and Beijing-Shanghai railway trunk lines. The marshalling lines here are like a spider web, with trains coming and going like shuttles every day. Since the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, an average of 7,000 freight cars need to be assembled and disassembled here daily, an increase of one-quarter compared to the first quarter of this year.

    The station's employees broke through the view that "the station is a user department and does not manage the construction of railway equipment," and proposed converting the current parallel marshalling yard into a hump marshalling yard. Bi Zhen, Xu Jun, and Peng Shi'an, cadres sent down from the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Administration, proposed raising the original parallel lead-out line to a gradient of three per thousand, transforming it into a marshalling yard shaped like a hump. This suggestion received the support of the station leadership. Guo Wenbin, secretary of the Fengtai Station Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally served as the leader of the earthen hump reconstruction group, leading the reconstruction work. During construction, the station's employees and railway employees in the Fengtai area completed more than 700 cubic meters of earthwork through voluntary labor and built three earthen hump marshalling yards in just five days without spending a penny of state money.

    The earthen hump marshalling yard involves using a locomotive to push dozens of freight cars onto the hump, using the slope to allow the freight cars to automatically slide to the original eleven tracks separately. Tests have proven that using the hump marshalling yard to assemble and disassemble a train of thirty-four freight cars only takes ten minutes; this is twenty-five minutes shorter than the past method of using a locomotive to pull thirty-four freight cars to various tracks. According to preliminary calculations by the station, due to the reconstruction of the three hump marshalling yards, the station's overall marshalling capacity has increased from the original 7,000 freight cars per day and night to more than 14,000 freight cars, which is expected to meet the needs of the increased transportation volume this winter.

    Yu Guangsheng, Vice Minister of Railways, told reporters that Fengtai's practice of building earthen humps proves that this method of reconstructing existing marshalling yards, which involves small projects, low costs, fast speed, and high efficiency, can serve as one of the effective measures for larger marshalling stations in our country to improve marshalling capacity and change the current freight transport strain, and can also lay a good foundation for marshalling stations to transition to modern hump marshalling yards.

### 丰台建成三个土驼峰调车场  五天时间，不花钱，调车能力翻一番

    丰台建成三个土驼峰调车场
    五天时间，不花钱，调车能力翻一番
    据新华社3日讯　丰台车站的职工在五天内建成了三个“土驼峰”调车场，使车站的调车能力提高一倍，对解决目前运输紧张的状况提供了有利条件。
    丰台车站是京包、京山、京汉、京沪等铁路干线的运输枢纽。这里的调车路线像蛛网一样，每天列车穿梭似地来往。自从工业、农业大跃进以后，每天平均有七千辆车皮需要在这里进行编组、解体，比今年第一季度增加了四分之一。
    这个车站的职工冲破了“车站是使用部门，不管铁路设备的建设”的看法，提出将目前平行调车场改建为驼峰式调车场的建议。铁道部和北京铁路管理局下放干部毕振、徐俊、彭世安提出了把原有的平行牵出线抬高成千分之三，改建成像一个驼峰形状的调车场的方案。这项建议得到了车站领导上的支持。中共丰台车站委员会书记郭文彬亲自担任了改建土驼峰小组的组长，领导改建工作。在施工时，这个车站的职工和丰台地区的铁路职工，用义务劳动完成了七百多立方公尺的土方，只用五天时间没花国家一分钱就修建了三个土驼峰调车场。
    土驼峰调车场，就是用机车顶着几十节车皮到驼峰上，利用坡度，使车皮分别自动滑到原有的十一条股道上去。试验证明，利用驼峰调车场编组、解体一列三十四节车皮的列车，只要十分钟就够了；比过去用机车拉着三十四节车皮分到各条股道上，能缩短二十五分钟。据车站初步计算，由于改建了三个驼峰调车场，全车站的编组能力由原来每昼夜的七千节车皮提高到一万四千多节，预计能够适应今年冬季运输量增加的需要。
    铁道部副部长余光生告诉记者，丰台修建土驼峰的实践证明：这种工程小、花钱少、速度快、效率高的改建现有调车场的作法，可以作为我国较大编组站提高编组能力、改变目前货运紧张的有效措施之一，而且可以为编组站过渡到现代化驼峰调车场打好基础。
