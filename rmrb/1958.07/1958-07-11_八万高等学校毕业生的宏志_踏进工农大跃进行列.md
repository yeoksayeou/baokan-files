Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: This year, more than 79,000 graduating students from universities and colleges across the country, some have completed their exams, and some are still taking them, and will soon be assigned work and embark on socialist construction posts.

Due to the rapid leap forward in China's socialist construction, higher education for cultivating construction talents has also undergone tremendous development. The number of graduates this year has increased by more than 23,000 compared to last year. From liberation to this year, over the past few years, universities and colleges across the country have provided the country with a total of more than 437,900 graduates in various disciplines, which is more than twice the total number of college graduates in the old China from 1912 to 1947 in thirty-six years. In New China, the development of socialist industrial production is also reflected in the development of education. The total number of engineering graduates in the past two years alone, last year and this year, is more than 35,000, a figure that exceeds the total number of engineering graduates in the Kuomintang era from 1928 to 1947 by 11%. Currently, there are more than 300 majors in universities and colleges, many of which did not exist in the Kuomintang era. Today, in China, not only are new and modern scientific majors being established one after another, but also new batches of graduates from new majors are graduating from schools and taking up jobs every year. This year's allocation of college graduates nationwide is based on the principle of both comprehensively supporting the great leap forward in local industry and agricultural production, and also considering the urgent needs of certain aspects of the central departments, and a balance has been made nationwide. In view of the relatively weak technical foundation of local areas and the great development of local industry and agriculture, more arrangements have been made for the needs of local industrial and agricultural production during the allocation; special care and support have been given to provinces and autonomous regions with particularly weak technical forces; and necessary arrangements have also been made for some provinces and regions with better foundations to promote further leaps in production. The number of university graduates assigned to local areas accounts for about 82% of the total number of graduates.

    八万高等学校毕业生的宏志
    踏进工农大跃进行列
    新华社10日讯　今年全国高等学校七万九千多名应届毕业的学生，有的已考试完毕，有的正在考试，即将分配工作走上社会主义建设岗位。
    由于我国社会主义建设一日千里地飞速跃进，培养建设人材的高等教育也随之而有巨大的发展，今年毕业生人数比去年增加二万三千多人。解放后到今年为止，几年来全国高等学校为国家输送的各科毕业生总数达四十三万七千九百多人，相当于解放前旧中国从1912年到1947年三十六年间高等学校毕业生总数的两倍多。在新中国，从教育事业的发展中也反映出社会主义工业生产的大步跃进，单是去年和今年两年的工科毕业生总数即有三万五千多人，这一数字超过旧中国国民党时代从1928年到1947年的二十年中工科毕业生总数11％。目前在高等学校中设置了三百多个专业，许多专业都是国民党时代所没有的，今天在我国不但陆续建立起现代科学的崭新的专业，而且每年都有新专业的毕业生一批一批地从学校毕业走上工作岗位。今年对全国高等学校毕业生的分配，本着既要全面支援地方工业、农业生产的大跃进，也要考虑中央部门的某些方面的急需的原则，在全国范围内进行了平衡。根据地方技术力量基础较为薄弱和地方工农业大发展等情况，分配时对地方工、农业生产的需要作了比较多的配备；对技术力量特别薄弱的省、自治区，作了特殊的照顾和支援；对一些基础较好的省、区，也作了必要的配备，促进生产再跃进。分配给地方的高等学校毕业生人数，占毕业生总数82％左右。
