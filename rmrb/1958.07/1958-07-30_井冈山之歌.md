Iron flows from the foot of the mountain, and the valleys on Jinggang Mountain are full of buildings.
Iron flows from the foot of Jinggang Mountain, the cradle of the revolution is full of treasures, and both industry and agriculture are reaping bumper harvests.
Go all out, aim high, and strive for the top.
Work hard for one year and it's like ten autumns.
Make more steel and build machines,
So that plowing the fields doesn't require old oxen.
Iron flows from the foot of Jinggang Mountain,
The people of Jinggang Mountain are full of energy.
Build with greater, faster, better, and more economical results,
And vow not to rest until we surpass England and America!
	(Shan Qiao)
Factories in Mountainous Areas
Red sun rises on the mountain slopes.
We must also build factories in mountainous areas,
To realize transportation by vehicles and boats,
And let electric lights illuminate all the farms.
	(Li Xingnan, Ye Deqin)

    井冈山之歌
    山下铁水流井冈山上谷满楼，井冈山下铁水流，革命摇篮尽是宝，工农生产两丰收。鼓足干劲争上游，苦战一年当十秋，多炼钢铁造机器，耕田不用老黄牛。井冈山下铁水流，井冈山人民有劲头，多快好省搞建设，不超英美誓不休！
              （山樵）
  山区办工厂山坡升起红太阳，山区也要办工厂，实现交通车船化，电灯照遍全农庄。
      （李醒南、叶德秦）
