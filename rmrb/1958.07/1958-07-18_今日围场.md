Today's Weichang
Ai Changqing

At the mention of "Weichang," people know it as the place where emperors hunted. But today's Weichang will become one of China's future petroleum industrial bases. What a stark contrast between the old and new eras.

We had heard long ago that "Weichang" contains large reserves of oil shale. This time, having the opportunity to be there in person, I felt even more the richness and loveliness of this place. Departing from Chengde, heading north through Longhua County to the Yixun River for about ninety kilometers, we entered the Weichang County boundary. People may want to know some stories of the ancient Weichang, but scenes fade away, and we did not find any unique traces. The scenery along the way is beautiful, no different from "outside the enclosure." The difference is that the land on the mountains is more fertile than outside the enclosure, the soil is dark brown, and the crops grow lush and dark. When we returned to Chengde, we were in the same car with the representatives of the Weichang Youth Thousand-Jin Team, who were going to the province to report their achievement. The representative told me that more than 10,000 mu of land in 165 youth teams across the county could yield over a thousand jin per mu, and some could even exceed two thousand jin. Here, one cannot help but think of the folk song "Walking West," which describes the story of lovers when the people inside the pass were forced by life to flee outside the pass to make a living. It turns out that the working people had long discovered the richness and beauty of this place. The so-called "desolate outside the Great Wall" and "barren borders" are nothing more than the distortion and slander of the ruling class.

On the eve of liberation, the people of Weichang were indeed in a state of poverty and disease. According to the investigation at that time, out of the 260,000 people in the county, 130,000 were victims of disasters, and 80,000 were opium addicts with deep-rooted social vices, and nearly half of the cultivated land was deserted. Now, the county's population is 280,000, and the planting area this year has reached more than 1.4 million mu, with more than 2 million mu of pasture, more than 1 million mu of forest area, and more than 1,000 mu of orchards. Last year, the total grain harvest was more than 200 million jin, and this year it will reach more than 500 million jin. The number of livestock has increased three times compared with before liberation, and the number of pigs has almost grown from scratch. This year, the target of one pig per person will be achieved. In many places with abundant water and grass that we passed, "cattle and sheep can be seen when the wind blows the grass low" everywhere. But what caught our attention was not only the herds of cattle and sheep, but also countless herds of pigs. Many women and children were herding groups of pigs in the pasture.

The improvement of people's living standards provides a prerequisite for the development of local industry. At present, the people of the county have started a new battle: to turn oil shale into petroleum. Almost everywhere in Weichang County contains oil shale, with the largest reserves in Qingquan and Mengkui. The ore bodies in these two places stretch for dozens of miles, and many are exposed on the ground. Local people often dig it up and use it as firewood.

We visited the Qingquan mining area. In this area, oil shale ore bodies are exposed everywhere. One small hill connects to another. Some expose a line on the hillside, and some entire hillocks are ore, only covered with a thin layer of soil. Currently, the areas that have been mined are Erdaogou, Sandaogou, and Sandaochuan. When we went to visit Sandaogou, dozens of workers who had just been transformed from farmers were digging and transporting the thin soil covering the ore body, preparing to mine it in large quantities to supply the ore for the indigenous oil refinery that would produce oil the next day. This ore body is a small hill, and the ore exposed outside is as high as three or four meters. When we picked up a pickaxe, the loose rock layer flowed down piece by piece. The thin shale is like pages of a book. Shale is named for this reason. Oil shale is a sedimentary rock formed by layers of mud accumulation. Its colors are yellow, gray, brown, dark brown, and so on. Judging from the mined ore, the one from Sandaochuan is the best. It is dark brown, light in texture and moist. When using a knife to shave lightly on the stone, the stone shavings curl without breaking, proving that its oil content is not low. It is said that the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has conducted tests, and the oil content of general ore is between 5% and 8%.

According to geologists, this area is a Cretaceous stratum, formed about 60 million years ago. Before that, this area was a large inland sea, where a large number of fish, shrimp, or other aquatic animals and algae and other plants grew. Due to the continuous accumulation of mud, the sea became land, and these aquatic animals and plants were compressed underneath, and then slowly rotted, the oil soaked in the soil, and after many years of changes, oil shale was formed. Fossils of fish, shrimp, and aquatic plants have been found in many shale mines, which not only have archaeological value but also artistic value.

Under the principle of first getting on the horse with indigenous methods and then engaging in mechanization, the people of Weichang County have built an indigenous oil refinery in Qingquan Township. When we went, the dry distillation furnace had not yet been built, but after a night of hard work, the next morning we saw drops of oil flowing out of the dry distillation tower. This dry distillation furnace is very simple. It is built with bricks. Ignition materials are placed in the furnace, and shale is poured down from above. When the fire is lit, the shale burns fiercely, generating gas. After cooling, the oil content in the gas flows into the oil tank along with distilled water, floating a layer of black oil. How exciting it is that people use their own hands to refine petroleum. Everyone is rushing to see what petroleum looks like. The area around the dry distillation tower is crowded with people, including local people and people from other places who come to observe. Everyone is smiling and celebrating the victory with each other.

However, this victory is only the beginning. Opposite this indigenous oil refinery, a mechanized oil refinery is about to start construction. The site has been selected, and building materials and machinery and equipment have been successively transported. According to the responsible comrades in the county, oil production can begin in the second half of the year. This refinery will initially produce 3,000 tons of petroleum annually, but things grow from small to large. It will continue to expand on this basis. It is estimated that it will soon become a petroleum plant producing tens of thousands of tons, hundreds of thousands of tons, or even millions of tons. At that time, the ancient Weichang will become a modern petroleum industrial base.

    今日围场

    一提起“围场”，人们都知道这是皇帝狩猎的地方。但是现在的围场，却将成为我国未来的石油工业基地之一，这是新旧时代的多么鲜明的对照。
    在很早以前，我们就听说“围场”蕴藏有大量的油母页岩，这次有机会身临其境就更加感到这块地方的富饶可爱了。从承德出发北行经过隆化县到达伊逊河边约九十公里，便进入围场县境。人们也许很想知道古围场的一些故事，但景物易逝，我们并没有发现什么特有的痕迹，沿途山川锦秀，与“围外”并没有什么两样。所不同的是山峦的土地较之围外更肥沃一些，土地呈黑褐色，庄稼长的黑芜芜的。当我们返回承德途中，正和去省里报捷的围场青年千斤队的代表同车。这位代表告诉我，全县一百六十五个青年队的上万亩土地都可以达到千斤以上，有的还可以超过两千斤。这里，不由人想起“走西口”的民歌，这首歌是描写口里人民为生活所迫逃向口外谋生时夫妻相恋的故事的。原来，劳动人民早已发现这块地方的富饶、美丽。所谓“塞外荒凉”，“边疆不毛”，只不过是统治阶级的歪曲和污蔑而已。
    解放前夕，围场人民的确已处于穷病交加的境地。据当时调查，全县二十六万人口，灾民即达十三万，还有深染社会恶习的吸大烟的八万烟民，耕地荒芜近半；现在全县人口二十八万，今年播种面积已达一百四十多万亩，牧场二百多万亩、林区一百多万亩、果园一千多亩，去年共收粮食二亿多斤，今年将达五亿多斤。牲畜已较解放前增加了三倍，生猪几乎是从无到有，今年将达到每人一口猪的指标。在我们经过的许多水草丰盛的地方，到处都是“风吹草底见牛羊”。但是引起我们注意的不仅是成群的牛羊，而且有了无数的猪群。许多妇女和儿童们赶着一群群的猪在牧放。
    人民生活水平提高了，就给发展地方工业提供了前提。目前全县人民都开始了一个新的战斗：把油母页岩变成石油。围场县境几乎到处都蕴藏有油页岩，藏量最多的是清泉、孟奎两地。这两个地的矿体都绵延数十里，许多都裸露在地面，当地人民常常把它刨来当柴烧。
    我们访问了清泉矿区。在这一带到处都裸露着油页矿体，一个小山岗接着一个小山岗，有的在半坡上露出一线，有的整个小丘都是矿石，只是上面复盖着一层薄土。目前已经开采的有二道沟、三道沟、三道川等处。我们去三道沟参观时，几十个刚由农民变成的工人正在挖掘、搬运盖在矿体上面的薄土，准备大量开采，供应第二天即将出油的土法炼油厂的矿石。这处矿体就是一座小丘，裸露在外面的矿石高达三、四公尺，我们拿起铁镐一刨，疏松的岩层就一片片地流了下来，薄薄的石片就像一页页的书篇。页岩即因此而得名。油页岩是一种沉积岩，由一层层的泥土沉积而成。它的颜色有黄色、灰色、褐色、棕黑色等等。从已开采的矿石看来，以三道川的为最好，它呈棕黑色，质地很轻而滋润，用小刀在石上轻轻一削，石削卷曲而不碎裂，证明它的含油率不低。据说，石油工业部曾进行过化验，一般矿石的含油率在5％到8％。
    据地质学家说，这一带地区是白垩纪地层，形成时间距今约六千万年。在这之前，这块地区是一片大的内海，生长着大量的鱼虾或其他水生动物和水藻等植物，由于泥土的不断沉积，大海变成了陆地，这些水生动植物被积压在下面，然后慢慢腐烂，油脂浸透在土里，再经过若干年的变化才形成油母页岩。在许多页矿中都发现鱼虾和水草的化石，不仅具有考古价值，且富有艺术价值。
    在先用土法跨上马，然后再搞机械化的方针下，围场县的人民已在清泉乡建起一座土法炼油厂。当我们去时，干馏炉还没砌好，但经过一夜苦战，第二天上午我们就看到一滴滴的油水从干馏塔里流出来。这座干馏炉很简单，是用砖砌的，炉里放上引火物，页岩从上面倒下去，点着火，页岩就燃起熊熊的火焰，发生气体，再经过冷却，气里含的油分就同蒸馏水一起流进油槽，浮起一层黑色的石油。人们用自己的双手炼出了石油，是多么兴奋呀，大家都争先恐后地去看石油是什么样子，干馏塔四周挤满了人群，有本地的群众，还有外地来观摩的人们，人人笑逐颜开，互庆胜利。
    但是，这个胜利只不过仅仅是开始而已，在这座土法炼油场的对面，一座机器炼油厂即将动工兴建，厂址已经选定，建筑材料和机器设备都已陆续运来，据县里的负责同志说：下半年即可开始出油。这座炼油厂开始将年产石油三千吨，但事情都是由小到大的，它将在此基础上不断扩建。估计在不久就将陆续成为几万吨、几十万吨以至百万吨的石油厂。到那时，古围场就将变成现代化的石油工业基地了。
