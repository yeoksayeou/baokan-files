Students Have the Right to Speak on Teaching Reform
Baisheng

Recently, many institutions of higher education have been actively implementing the socialist education policy of cultivating laborers with both socialist consciousness and culture. With a revolutionary spirit, they are revising teaching plans, drafting teaching outlines, and formulating curriculum reform programs. This series of teaching reforms is of great significance for building China's higher education and cultivating talents who are both red and expert.

To implement the socialist education policy, we must thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system and teaching ideology that are divorced from reality and productive labor. We must re-establish a proletarian educational system and educational ideology that are combined with reality and productive labor. This is a struggle between two roads, a revolution in education. To achieve this revolution in education, we must resolutely follow the mass line under the leadership of the Party, rather than relying solely on a few professors and experts.

Mobilizing students to participate in teaching reform is an initiative, a mass line approach, and a revolutionary approach. In this teaching reform work, Beijing Normal University, under the leadership of the Party committee, mobilized teachers and students to work together, achieving a three-way combination of the Party committee, teaching and research sections, and students. Young students broke down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and promoted the communist spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. They launched a struggle between two roads in education, and quickly collectively compiled teaching outlines, opening up a broad road for teaching reform based on the mass line and drastic changes. This direction is correct, and the spirit is commendable. Although the teaching outlines they compiled may still have many shortcomings, in any case, these are fundamentally innovative teaching outlines. Take the Chinese Department, for example. The teaching outlines compiled by the teaching and research section in the past contained serious bourgeois viewpoints of valuing the past over the present and advocating restoration. They spread a pessimistic and decadent mood, leading students to the realm of "willow banks, morning breeze, and waning moon," and immersing them in "light sorrow." In contrast, the teaching outlines compiled by the students this time take politics as the commander, value the present over the past, have a clear class viewpoint, and guide students to take the road of socialist realism. Comparing the two, who is better and who is worse, isn't it clear?

In institutions of higher education, there are still many people who do not believe in the masses, believing that students are young and naive and lack teaching experience. Some experts and professors are superstitious about old ideological systems, treating them as golden rules and jade laws, and daring not to reform or being unable to reform. They believe that students have no right to speak on teaching reform at all. However, the quality of teaching work has the greatest impact on students, and students have the deepest feelings. Therefore, students can not only speak on teaching reform, but also speak purposefully based on their personal experiences. The example of Beijing Normal University drafting new teaching outlines proves that students can break away from dogmatism, promote a spirit of creation, and compile teaching outlines needed for socialist education quickly and well. Faced with the facts, many experts and professors who only believe in themselves and do not believe in the masses should learn a profound lesson from this.

The mass line is our political line, organizational line, and work line. We must not only follow the mass line in formulating teaching outlines, but also in all aspects of teaching reform. Only by combining the leadership of the Party with the masses, fully mobilizing the masses, letting the masses speak out, everyone contributing ideas, and everyone contributing efforts, can we implement the spirit of the general line of socialist construction and build China's higher education with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    学生对教学改革有发言权
    柏生
    最近，许多高等学校积极贯彻培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的社会主义教育方针，以革命精神修订教学计划，拟订教学大纲和制定课程改革方案。这一系列的教学改革，对于建设我国的高等教育事业，培养又红又专的建设人才有重大意义。
    我们要贯彻社会主义的教育方针，就必须彻底粉碎资产阶级的脱离实际、脱离生产劳动的教育制度和教学思想体系，重新建立起一套无产阶级的结合实际、结合生产劳动的教育制度和教育思想体系。这是两条道路的斗争，是教育上的革命。要实现教育上的这种革命，就必然要在党的领导下坚决走群众路线，而不是光依靠少数教授和专家。
    发动学生参加教学改革工作是一项创举，是群众路线的办法、革命的办法。在这次教学改革工作中，北京师范大学在党委领导下，发动教师、学生一齐动手，做到党委、教研室、学生三结合。青年学生打破迷信、解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义精神，展开了教育上两条道路的斗争，很快就集体编拟了教学大纲，给教学改革工作打开了走群众路线大改特改的一条大路。这一方向是正确的，精神是可嘉的。虽然说，他们编拟的教学大纲可能还有许多缺点，但无论如何这是根本革新的教学大纲。就以中文系来说，过去教研室编拟的教学大纲，存在着严重的厚古薄今、复古主义的资产阶级观点，散布消极颓废的没落情调，把学生引向“杨柳岸晓风残月”的境界，陷入“淡淡的哀愁”中。而与此相对立的是，这次学生们编拟的教学大纲，则是以政治做统帅，厚今薄古，有明确的阶级观点，引导学生走社会主义现实主义的道路。两者相较，谁好谁差，不是明明白白的吗？
    在高等学校中，至今还有许多人不相信群众，认为学生年青幼稚，又没有教学经验。一些专家和教授，迷信旧的思想体系，奉如金科玉律，不敢改革也不能改革。他们认为学生对教学改革根本没有发言权。可是，教学工作的好坏，对学生的关系最大，学生所受的感触最深。因此，学生对教学改革不仅能发言，而且可以从亲身体会出发，有的放矢。北京师范大学拟编新的教学大纲的事例，就证明了学生能够破除教条，发扬创造精神，又快又好地编出社会主义教育所需要的教学大纲。在事实的面前，许多只迷信自己、不相信群众的专家和教授应当从中上了深刻的一课。
    群众路线是我们的政治路线组织路线和工作路线，我们不仅在制订教学大纲中要走群众路线，而且在教学改革的各方面工作中都要走群众路线。只有党的领导与群众相结合，充分发动群众，让群众都来发言，人人献计，个个出力，才能贯彻社会主义建设总路线的精神，多快好省地建设我国的高等教育事业。
