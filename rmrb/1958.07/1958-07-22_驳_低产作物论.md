Refuting the "Low-Yield Crop Theory"
Zhang Ke

Those who advocate the "low-yield crop theory" divide crops into two categories: one is called high-yield crops, and the other is called "low-yield crops." They believe that high-yield crops are inherently high-yielding, and "low-yield crops" are inherently low-yielding, impossible to improve no matter what.

It is an objective fact that crop yields vary. But how did this "objective fact" come about? Has it always been this way, will it always be this way, and is it fundamentally unchangeable? No, it can be changed. Yield levels have always shifted depending on the degree of subjective effort. The reason why "low-yield crops" have low yields is precisely because people do not pay enough attention to them and cultivate them carelessly. It is not the fault of the crops themselves. It is not as if they are inherently unenterprising. We believe that any crop can be made to reach the yield level of high-yield crops through human effort. There has never been a crop in the world whose yield cannot be improved at all or that remains forever at a fixed and unchanging level.

Two years ago, many people called wheat a "low-yield crop," believing that it had little future and even suggested abandoning it. However, with one Great Leap Forward, wheat leaped to the forefront of high yields, with not only high-yield experimental fields producing over 7,000 catties per mu, but also many large-area high-yield counties with average yields of 500 or 600 catties per mu. Why could this wheat, which was called a "low-yield crop," increase its yield so much this year? The reason is very simple: human effort.

However, those who advocate the "low-yield crop theory" are not giving up and are still spreading low-yield nonsense everywhere. They say, "It may be possible to increase the yield of wheat and soybeans, but sorghum, millet, and other small-grain crops are truly born with bones and flesh that are already grown; they cannot be increased much further." This argument is groundless. Taking millet as an example, the current yield is indeed lower than that of rice and wheat, but the low yield of millet cannot be blamed on millet itself. Otherwise, how can we explain the yields of over 1,000 catties that have appeared in many places several years ago?

Regardless of the motives of those who advocate the "low-yield crop theory," the effect is very bad. It will slacken people's efforts in cultivating these crops. Sorghum, millet, corn, and other crops account for more than 45% of the total crop area. If the yield of these crops cannot be increased quickly, what impact will this have on the national grain production, especially this year's Great Leap Forward in grain production? These crops are the staple food for people in many places, with sorghum in the Northeast and millet in the Northwest being as important as rice in the South. Failing to lead the masses to actively increase their yields can only be a manifestation of not caring about the lives of the masses and lacking a mass perspective. In terms of cultivation and management, farmers in the producing areas have many good experiences. As long as these are improved on the original basis, the yield of these crops can be quickly increased, and the "low-yield crop theory" can be bankrupted in the face of facts.

    驳“低产作物论”
    张克
    “低产作物论”者把农作物分成两类：一类叫高产作物，一类叫“低产作物”。并且认为高产作物产量就一定高，“低产作物”产量就一定低，无论怎样也没法提高。
    农作物的产量有高有低，这是客观事实。但是这个“客观事实”是怎样发生的？是从来如此，永远如此，根本不能改变了吗？不是的，是可以改变的，产量的高低从来就是以人的主观努力程度为转移。“低产作物”的产量所以低，正是由于人们对它不重视、耕作粗放造成的，并非作物本身的过错。并非它们天生如此不长进。我们认为任何作物都可以通过人的努力，使之达到高产作物的产量水平。世界上从来不存在产量根本不能提高或永远停留在一个固定不变的水平线上的作物。
    两年以前，不少人曾把小麦叫做“低产作物”，认为它前途不大，并有废弃之议。但是一个大跃进，小麦便跃居高产的前列，不仅有亩产七千多斤高额丰产试验田，并有很多平均亩产五、六百斤的大面积丰产县。这个被叫作“低产作物”的小麦今年为什么能把产量提得这样高呢？道理很简单：人的努力。
    然而“低产作物论”者并不服输，还在到处散布低产滥调。说什么“小麦大豆能提高产量或可有之，高粱、谷子等小籽粒作物，真是生就的骨头长就的肉，再也高不了多少。”这种论调毫无根据，以谷子来说，现有产量是比水稻、小麦低些，但谷子产量之所以低，同样不能归罪于谷子本身。不然，很多地方几年前就已出现的千斤以上的产量又怎样解释呢？
    不管“低产作物论”者的动机如何，其效果都是很坏的，它会松懈人们对这些作物的培育耕作的努力。高粱、谷子、玉米等作物的种植面积占全部农作物面积的45％以上，如果这些作物的产量不能很快提高，对全国粮食生产首先是今年的粮食大跃进将要发生怎样的影响呢？这些作物在很多地方都是人民生活的主粮，东北之与高粱、西北之与小米，如同南方之与大米一样。不领导群众积极提高其产量，只能是不关心群众生活缺乏群众观点的表现。在栽培管理方面，产区农民有很多好的经验，只要在原有基础上加以改进，就能很快提高这些作物的产量。就能够使“低产作物论”在事实面前破产。
