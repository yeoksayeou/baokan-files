Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd -- China's first plastic boat, made in Shanghai, proved to have good performance after a trial voyage on the 22nd.

This plastic boat is a yacht that can carry four people. The hull is made of "fiberglass" synthesized from domestic plastic and glass fiber. It weighs only fifty kilograms, which is half the weight of a wooden boat of the same size and a quarter of the weight of a steel plate boat. Two people can carry it away. Although the hull is only one-third of an inch thick, it is very strong, impenetrable by handgun bullets, rust-proof, leak-proof, and will not break if it hits a reef. The stern is equipped with a three-horsepower gasoline engine, which can travel eighteen kilometers per hour.

After the Shanghai Chemical Plant, Yaohua Glass Factory, and Bailianjing Shipyard successfully trial-produced this plastic boat, they recently signed a contract to prepare to manufacture another streamlined plastic speedboat that can carry twenty people.

Using fiberglass to manufacture ordinary ships for inland river navigation can save a lot of timber, and because the shipbuilding method is simple, the shipbuilding time can also be greatly shortened.

    第一艘塑料船
    新华社上海23日电　上海制成的我国第一艘塑料船，在22日经过试航证明性能良好。
    这艘塑料船是一艘可以乘坐四个人的游艇。船身是用国产塑料和玻璃纤维合成的“玻璃钢”做的，只有五十公斤重，比同样大小的木船轻一半，比钢板船轻四分之三，两个人就可以抬走。船壳虽只有三分之一寸厚，但非常坚牢，手枪子弹都打不进，不会生锈漏水，撞到暗礁也不会破裂。船尾装有三马力的汽油发动机，每小时可航行十八公里。
    上海化工厂、耀华玻璃厂和白莲泾船厂合作试制成功这艘塑料船后，最近已经签订合同，准备再制造一艘可以乘二十人的流线型塑料快艇。
    采用玻璃钢制造内河航行的普通船只，既能节约大量木材，而且因造船方法简单，造船时间还可以大大缩短。
