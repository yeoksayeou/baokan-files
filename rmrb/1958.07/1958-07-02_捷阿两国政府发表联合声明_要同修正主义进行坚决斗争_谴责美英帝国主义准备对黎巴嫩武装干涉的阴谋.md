Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 30th – A joint statement issued here this afternoon by the governments of Czechoslovakia and Albania emphasized that the main danger at present is revisionism, which threatens the interests of the countries of the socialist camp, the revolutionary working-class movement, and world peace. Many facts prove that modern revisionism serves the interests of imperialism. The two governments believe that a consistent and open struggle against revisionist views is their international duty. They will resolutely oppose all attempts to revise Marxist-Leninist doctrine, which is most evident in Yugoslavia at present.

The statement also pointed out that in their relations with Yugoslavia, they have made every possible effort, but the Yugoslav leaders have not shown the same willingness. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have stubbornly adhered to their revisionist stance in the past and continue to do so now, and are taking the lead in opposing the socialist countries and the unity between these countries, and opposing the policies of the Communist and Workers' Parties.

The two governments stated that they will strive to maintain such state relations with Yugoslavia as will be beneficial to both sides and in line with the interests of the entire socialist camp.

When discussing the importance of unity among the countries of the socialist camp, the joint statement pointed out that the immeasurable assistance and comprehensive support of the Soviet Union are the foundation for the great victories achieved by Czechoslovakia, Albania, and other people's democratic countries. The two governments guarantee to do everything possible to safeguard and strengthen the unity of the socialist countries and to enhance relations between all countries of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The statement pointed out that in order to conceal war preparations, the imperialist bloc is trying to intensify subversive activities, with its spearhead mainly directed at the countries of the socialist camp and those Asian and African countries that are fighting for or strengthening their independence. The statement pointed out that under these circumstances, further strengthening and consolidating the unity and fraternal cooperation of the socialist countries is of particularly great significance.

Both sides expressed indignation at the attempts by Western countries to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian and African countries. They resolutely condemned the U.S. and British imperialist plot to prepare for armed intervention against the Lebanese people.

The two governments expressed their support for Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference. The two governments also sincerely care about expanding cooperation among all Balkan countries.

The two governments noted with satisfaction the good and comprehensive development of mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and Albania. The Albanian government expressed sincere gratitude for the fraternal assistance provided by Czechoslovakia.

During the talks, the two delegations also discussed issues concerning further economic, scientific-technical, and cultural cooperation between the two countries.

The statement pointed out that the two sides held completely identical views on all the issues discussed.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 30th – The Czechoslovak government delegation headed by Široký concluded its friendly visit to Albania and returned to Prague by plane on June 30th.

    捷阿两国政府发表联合声明
    要同修正主义进行坚决斗争
    谴责美英帝国主义准备对黎巴嫩武装干涉的阴谋
    新华社地拉那6月30日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府和阿尔巴尼亚政府今天下午在这里公布的联合声明强调指出，目前的主要危险是修正主义，它威胁着社会主义阵营国家，威胁革命工人阶级运动以及世界和平的利益。许多事实证明，现代修正主义是为帝国主义利益服务的。两国政府认为，对修正主义观点进行始终如一的和公开的斗争是他们的国际职责。他们要坚决反对一切修正马克思列宁主义学说的企图，这种企图目前在南斯拉夫表现得最为明显。
    声明还指出，在它们对待南斯拉夫的关系中，他们尽了一切可能的努力，但是南斯拉夫领导人并没有表现出同样的意愿。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人过去顽固地坚持、现在仍然坚持他们的修正主义立场，而且正在带头反对社会主义国家和这些国家之间的团结，反对共产党和工人党的政策。
    两国政府表示，他们将努力同南斯拉夫维持这样的一种国家关系，这种关系将要是对双方有利的，而且是符合于整个社会主义阵营利益的。
    联合声明在谈到社会主义阵营国家团结的重要性时指出，苏联的难以估计的援助和全面的支持是捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚以及其他人民民主国家取得伟大胜利的基础。两国政府保证要尽一切可能维护和加强社会主义国家的团结，并且增进以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营各国之间的关系。
    声明指出，帝国主义集团为了掩盖战争准备，正在设法加紧进行颠覆活动，它的矛头主要是指向社会主义阵营国家以及那些正在为争取或者加强本国的独立而斗争的亚非国家。声明指出，在这种情况下，进一步加强和巩固社会主义国家的团结和兄弟合作就具有特别重大的意义。
    双方对于西方国家干涉亚非国家内政的企图表示愤慨。他们坚决谴责美英帝国主义准备对黎巴嫩人民进行武装干涉的阴谋。
    两国政府表示支持波兰关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议，支持苏联关于召开最高级会议的建议。两国政府还真诚地关心扩大所有巴尔干国家之间的合作问题。
    两国政府满意地注意到，捷克斯洛伐克和阿尔巴尼亚相互关系的良好和全面的发展。阿尔巴尼亚政府对捷克斯洛伐克所提供的兄弟般的帮助表示真诚的感激。
    两国代表团在会谈期间还讨论了关于两国经济、科学—技术和文化进一步合作的问题。
    声明指出，双方在讨论过的全部问题上，看法完全一致。
    新华社布拉格30日电　以西罗基为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团结束了在阿尔巴尼亚的友好访问，已经在6月30日乘飞机回到布拉格。
