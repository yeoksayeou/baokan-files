Planting Red Flags in the Realm of Classical Literature
Jiang Hangsu, Fourth-Year Student, Chinese Department, Beijing Normal University

In the past, our department’s literature courses were taught by bourgeois experts, who spread a great deal of poison in the classroom. This time, the school Party committee launched a major teaching reform, and we fourth-year students participated in the work of planting red flags in the fields of Chinese and foreign classical literature. We formed various teaching reform groups, studied Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and re-evaluated the ancients based on the principle of "discarding the dross and absorbing the essence." One group of thirty-five people worked hard for seven days and nights, reading a total of 250 works of literature, from the Chu Ci and Yuan Qu to the pre-Qin philosophers and late Qing novels, and compiled a syllabus of Chinese literature. Another group was responsible for compiling a syllabus for foreign literature, breaking away from the teaching system of bourgeois professors, which only included the ancient and the West, and establishing a new system with socialist countries' literature and Eastern literature as the main focus. We young students did not know which important writers and works existed in Eastern literature in the past, nor did we know where to find such materials, but we ran to more than ten places in Beijing in one day and found relevant materials from all sides. Vietnamese and Korean students also gave us great support, helping us translate Vietnamese and Korean literary histories. After five days of hard work, this new foreign literature syllabus was also completed. We want to compete with the old teachers in terms of living knowledge and in using Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to treat classical literature.

    在古典文学领域里插红旗
    北京师范大学中文系四年级学生　蒋行素
    我们系过去的文学课是由资产阶级专家担任的，他们在课堂上散布了大量的毒素。这次学校党委发动教学大改革，我们四年级的学生参加了在中外古典文学领域里插红旗的工作，成立了各种教学改革小组，学习了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，本着“剔除糟粕，吸取精华”的方针重新评价古人，我们有一组三十五人苦干了七昼夜，读完了楚辞、元曲、先秦诸子一直到晚清的小说作品共二百五十部，编成了中国文学大纲。还有一组人担任了编写外国文学教学大纲的工作，他们打破了资产阶级教授那种只有古没有今、只有西方没有东方的教学体系，而建立了以社会主义国家文学和东方文学为主的新体系。我们这些青年学生，过去并不知道东方文学中有那些重要作家和作品，也不知道哪儿有这种材料，但是我们一天之中跑了北京城十多个地方，从各方面寻找到了有关的材料。越南、朝鲜的留学生也给我们很大支持，他们帮助我们翻译越南文学史、朝鲜文学史，经过五天的努力这个新的外国文学教学大纲也完成了。我们要和老教师比活知识，比用马列主义的观点对待古典文学。
