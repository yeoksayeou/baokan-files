    Combining Self-Study and Tutoring
    Tianjin Establishes Red and Expert Radio Correspondence University

    (Our report) Tianjin, with its pioneering spirit and breaking with conventions, established a Red and Expert Radio Correspondence University on the 16th of this month.

    This university, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, is jointly run by the Municipal Education Bureau, Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station, Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries, Bureau of Chemical Industries, Bureau of Heavy Industries, Tianjin University, Nankai University, and Tianjin Normal University. The president and vice-presidents of the university are Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Tianjin, and Wang Kangzhi, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, among others. The heads of each department are the directors of the relevant industrial bureaus in the city, and experts and university professors are hired as deputy department heads. The teaching staff consists of university professors and engineers and technical innovators with practical experience. The target students are mainly on-the-job workers and cadres. Except for the Chinese Language Department, which requires three years of study for graduation, the remaining four departments of Agriculture, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering require four years of study for graduation. There is a two-year preparatory course, and after six years of study, students reach the level of undergraduate graduation.

    These departments are opened according to the key points of industrial and agricultural development in Tianjin and the work needs of veteran cadres and veteran workers. The curriculum is designed based on the students' cultural level, closely combining with production and work realities, and taking into account long-term needs. For example, the Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Agriculture departments offer courses in general basic theory, professional technical theory, and technological innovation. In order to closely integrate with production needs, a course on technological innovation is also offered separately. Political education is a compulsory course for all departments. Students who do not study political education well will not be issued graduation certificates.

    Students mainly rely on self-study, and at the same time, classes or groups are formed based on factory and enterprise systems, and engineering and technical personnel are hired as learning tutors, responsible for guiding experiments, grading assignments, and answering difficult questions. Professors, teaching assistants, etc., also go deep into student study groups according to the specific situation to guide their learning. This university will also have an attached middle school department.

    自学和辅导相结合
    天津创办红专广播函授大学
    本报讯　天津市以首创的精神，打破常规，在本月16日创办了一所红专广播函授大学。
    这所大学是在中共天津市委的领导下，由市教育局、天津人民广播电台、机电工业局、化学工业局、重工业局、天津大学、南开大学、天津师范大学共同举办的。学校的正副校长由中共天津市委书记处书记、天津市市长李耕涛，市委书记王亢之等担任。各系系主任由市内各有关工业局的局长担任，并聘请专家、大学教授兼任副系主任。教学人员由大学教授和有实际经验的工程师、技术革新者来担任。吸收学员对象主要是在职职工和干部。除了中国语文系学习三年毕业外，其余农业、机械、电机和化工四个系都是四年毕业。设有二年制预科，学习六年达到大学本科毕业水平。
    这些系科是根据天津市工农业发展的重点，和老干部、老工人的工作需要而开设的。课程的设置是从学员的文化水平出发，密切结合生产实际和工作实际，并兼顾长远需要。如机械、电机、农业等系设有普通基础理论、专业技术理论和技术革新等课程。为了密切结合生产需要，还单独开设了技术革新课。政治课是各系的共同必修课。政治课学习不好的人，不发给毕业证书。
    学员以自学为主，同时以工厂企业系统为单位组成班或组，聘请工程技术人员做学习辅导员，负责指导实验，批阅作业和解答疑难问题。教授、助教等也根据具体情况，深入学员学习小组，指导他们学习。这所大学还要附设中学部。
