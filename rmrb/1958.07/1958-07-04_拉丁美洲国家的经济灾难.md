    Economic Disaster in Latin American Countries
    Zhang Ye
    Latin American countries are experiencing a severe economic disaster. With the outbreak and continued development of the economic crisis in the United States, this disaster has become even more profound. This is a direct result of the cruel plunder of these countries by US monopoly capital, and also the fundamental reason for the great development of the anti-American struggle of the Latin American people.
    The most important means by which US monopoly capital plunders Latin American countries is through capital export. US monopoly capital's investment in Latin America, counting only private investment, totaled $10.4 billion by the end of 1957, of which $3.7 billion was in short-term loans and indirect investment, and $6.7 billion was in direct investment. Of this $6.7 billion in private direct investment, $2.8 billion was invested in the oil industry, and the remaining $3.9 billion was mainly invested in mining and public utilities. The total direct investment, including government investment, amounted to $8.4 billion by the end of 1957, accounting for one-third of US direct investment abroad. It can be seen that direct investment accounts for a large proportion of US monopoly capital's investment in Latin American countries. This is because direct investment makes it easier for US monopoly capital to politically and economically enslave Latin American countries.
    US monopoly capital has obtained astonishingly high profits from this huge investment. US Senator Capehart once bluntly pointed out that US investment in Latin American countries "yields profits in one year equal to twelve years of investment in those countries." According to US newspapers, which clearly understated the figures, US monopoly capital made a total profit of $8,382.2 million in Latin America from 1946 to 1956.
    US monopoly capital continues to invest part of the profits it has exploited in these countries. Therefore, although the amount of US investment in Latin American countries increases year by year, it does not actually require new capital inflows; on the contrary, large amounts of funds flow into the United States from Latin American countries every year in the form of profits, thus leaving the economies of these countries in a chronic state of anemia.
    The characteristic of US investment in Latin America is that it is not oriented towards the diversified development of these countries' economies at all, but strives to invest capital in sectors that can bring them the highest profits. For example, in Venezuela, 70% of US investment is in the oil industry, and in Chile, 64% is in the mining industry. This makes it possible for the countries receiving investment to develop only one or a very few types of mineral resources and agricultural products. The result of this economically singular production and one-sided development not only hinders the development of the national industries of these countries, but also makes the main source of national income of these countries dependent on the export of a small number of commodities to the United States, thus placing them in a position of dependence on the United States economically and politically, and also facilitating the strict control of US monopoly capital over the foreign trade of Latin American countries.
    The main trading partner of Latin American countries is the United States. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, in 1956, the United States' share of the total imports of Latin American countries was 60%, of which the US share of Cuba's total imports was as high as 81%, Mexico's was 78%, Venezuela's was 62%, and Chile's was 57%; in the total exports of Latin American countries, the US share was 53%, of which the US share of Cuba's total exports was 71%, Brazil's was 57%, Venezuela's was 56%, and Bolivia's was 55%.
    US monopoly capital uses its monopoly position over Latin America's foreign trade to carry out the most brutal and blatant plunder of Latin American countries through unequal exchanges of "buying cheap and selling dear," manipulating international raw material market prices, dumping "surplus" agricultural products in the traditional markets of some Latin American countries, and restricting these countries from developing trade relations with other countries, especially socialist countries. As a result, the foreign trade deficits of Latin American countries have soared, foreign exchange reserves have been sharply reduced, and a serious financial crisis has been created. Since the outbreak of the US economic crisis, the economic difficulties of Latin American countries have become even more serious.
    After the outbreak of the US overproduction crisis, the demand for raw material commodity reserves was greatly reduced, and US monopoly capital took the opportunity to manipulate and depress prices, which caused the prices of raw materials from Latin American countries in the US market to continue to fall. Compared with the prices in January 1956, the price of copper fell by 46%, zinc fell by 23.1%, and tin fell by 14% in January 1958. The coffee price in New York fell from $0.78 per pound a year ago to $0.48 per pound at present. The magnitude of the price drop of major export commodities is so large that the economies of Latin American countries, which rely on exporting raw materials to the United States as the main source of national income, have suffered significant losses. According to a January estimate by Uruguay's "El Popular," Brazil loses $200 million annually due to the fall in coffee prices; Chile loses $80 million annually due to the fall in copper prices.
    Not only that. The United States is also doing everything possible to reduce and restrict imports from Latin American countries, which has also brought great difficulties to the economies of Latin American countries. For example, the US government, under the pretext of domestic overproduction of oil, has been trying its best to require Venezuela to "voluntarily" restrict the export of oil to the United States. Despite the Venezuelan government's opposition to this measure, Eisenhower issued an executive order stipulating that from April 1, oil companies currently importing crude oil must reduce their purchases by 15%. As a result, Venezuela has to cut its oil production by 14% and lose $250,000 per day. In addition, the United States is also preparing to raise tariffs on non-ferrous metal imports, which poses a great threat to Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico, which export non-ferrous metals, and has aroused dissatisfaction among a wide range of groups in these countries. Chilean President Ibáñez canceled his scheduled visit to the United States because the United States intended to restore the 2% import tax on copper.
    For the above reasons, exports from Latin American countries to the United States have decreased in trade with the United States, forming a huge trade deficit. In 1957, Latin American countries had a trade deficit of $906 million with the United States, while in 1956, the trade deficit of Latin American countries with the United States was $300 million. The outlook for 1958 is even gloomier. It is estimated that Argentina's trade deficit in 1958 will reach $359 million, compared with $195.4 million in 1957. Chile's copper exports will decrease by about $225 million in 1958, resulting in a trade deficit of $95 million. In the first three months of 1958, Brazil's coffee exports decreased by more than 1,599,000 bags compared with the same period in 1957. As a result, the gold and foreign exchange reserves of Latin American countries have been sharply reduced. Over the past three years, Argentina's gold and foreign exchange reserves have been reduced by an average of $10 million per month. Uruguay had $177 million in foreign exchange reserves in 1946, of which $119 million worth of gold was stored in the United States, but by 1958, not only had all of this gold been spent, but more than 14 tons of gold had been shipped from Uruguay. Peru had $40 million in foreign exchange reserves a year ago, but now it has fallen to $4 million. Brazil had $100 million in foreign exchange reserves a year ago, but by the beginning of 1958 it had less than $10 million left.
    With the decline in exports, industrial and agricultural production in many Latin American countries has declined sharply, and the number of unemployed has soared. In 1957, Chile's industrial production decreased by 13%, construction fell by more than 40%, and copper production was reduced by 10% from January 1958. In the first six months of 1957, compared with the same period in 1956, Mexico's lead production fell by 16%, zinc fell by 19%, copper fell by 54%, and 75% of small businesses across the country closed down. The number of unemployed in Latin American countries currently exceeds five million (the total population of Latin America is 183 million), which is comparable to the unemployment level in the United States.
    The deterioration of the economic situation has created a serious financial crisis in Latin American countries. This is first reflected in the ever-increasing budget deficits of these countries, and the resulting serious inflation. For example, Argentina's national income in 1958 is only enough for 70% of the national budget (estimated at 76 billion pesos). Brazil's budget deficit in 1957 reached 41 billion cruzeiros (the Brazilian currency), and it is estimated to increase to 45 billion in 1958. Inflation is already a common phenomenon in Latin American countries. The Brazilian government issued nearly 20 billion cruzeiros in banknotes in the first five months of 1958. Chile issued 12 billion pesos in banknotes in the first three months of 1958, more than double the amount in 1957. The inflation situation in Bolivia is even more serious. From April 1952 to December 1956, the amount of currency increased from 10 billion bolivianos (the Bolivian currency) to 180 billion, and from December 1956 to August 1957, another 85 billion was issued.
    As a result of inflation, the cost of living has risen, making the lives of the working people even more impoverished. Compared with 1956, the increase in the cost of living in Latin American countries in 1957 was as follows: Brazil 22.5%, Chile 35%, Argentina 38%, Colombia 20%. Uruguay's cost of living increased by 24% in just January to August 1957.
    The economic disaster in Latin American countries, caused by the US policy of plunder and the impact of the US economic crisis, is deepening. In order to get rid of this economic disaster, the Latin American people are increasingly widely launching an anti-American struggle for national independence, resolutely demanding that their governments pursue independent economic and diplomatic policies, and widely carrying out a movement to develop trade relations with socialist countries. Although there are still many obstacles on the road to this struggle, this struggle is bound to be victorious due to the increasing awareness and continuous strengthening of the unity of the people of Latin American countries. As long as Latin American countries can get rid of the economic shackles of the United States, their economic situation will be improved, and their national economies will be greatly developed.

    拉丁美洲国家的经济灾难
    章叶
    拉丁美洲国家正在经历着严重的经济灾难。随着美国经济危机的爆发和继续发展，这种灾难也更为加深了。这是美国垄断资本残酷地掠夺这些国家的直接结果，也是拉丁美洲人民反美斗争大大发展的基本原因。
    美国垄断资本掠夺拉丁美洲国家的最主要手段是资本输出。美国垄断资本对拉丁美洲的投资，如以私人投资计，到1957年年底，总额达一百零四亿美元，其中短期贷款和间接投资为三十七亿美元，直接投资为六十七亿美元。在这六十七亿美元的私人直接投资中，有二十八亿美元投资在石油业中，另外的三十九亿美元主要投在采矿和公用事业中。包括政府投资在内的直接投资总额，到1957年年底为八十四亿美元，占美国国外直接投资的三分之一。由此可见，在美国垄断资本对拉丁美洲国家的投资中，直接投资占了很大的比重。这是因为直接投资更便于美国垄断资本在政治上和经济上奴役拉丁美洲国家。
    美国垄断资本在这种庞大的投资中取得了惊人的高额利润。美国参议员凯普哈特曾毫不隐讳地指出，美国对拉丁美洲国家的投资，“在一年当中得到的利润就等于对这些国家十二年的投资。”另据美国报刊显然缩小了的统计，从1946年到1956年，美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲共获利八十三亿八千二百万美元。
    美国垄断资本把它们剥削来的一部分利润继续在这些国家投资。因而，美国对拉丁美洲国家的投资额虽然与年俱增，实际上并不需要新的资金流入；相反的，拉丁美洲国家每年都有大量的资金以利润的形式流入美国，从而使这些国家的经济长期陷于贫血状态。
    美国对拉丁美洲投资的特点是，根本没有面向这些国家经济的多方面发展，而是极力把资本投在能给它们带来最高利润的部门里。例如，在委内瑞拉，美国的投资70％投在石油工业，在智利，64％投在采矿业。这就使得接受投资的国家只能发展一种或极少数种类的矿产资源和农产品。这种经济上单一生产和片面发展的结果，不仅妨碍了这些国家民族工业的发展，而且使这些国家国民收入的主要来源依靠对美国输出少数种类的商品，因而在经济和政治上处于依赖美国的地位，同时也便利了美国垄断资本对拉丁美洲国家对外贸易的严格控制。
    拉丁美洲国家的主要贸易对象是美国。据联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会的统计，1956年在拉丁美洲国家进口总额中，美国的份额占60％，其中古巴进口总额中的美国份额高达81％，墨西哥为78％，委内瑞拉为62％，智利为57％；在拉丁美洲国家出口总额中，美国的份额占53％，其中古巴出口总额中的美国份额为71％，巴西为57％，委内瑞拉为56％，玻利维亚为55％。
    美国垄断资本利用它对拉丁美洲对外贸易的垄断地位，通过“贱买贵卖”的不等价交换、操纵国际原料市场价格、在某些拉丁美洲国家的传统市场上倾销“剩余”农产品、限制这些国家同其他国家，特别是社会主义国家发展贸易关系等手段，对拉丁美洲国家进行最残酷、最露骨的掠夺。由于这样，拉丁美洲国家的对外贸易逆差激增，外汇储备锐减，并且造成了严重的财政危机。美国经济危机发生以后，拉丁美洲国家的经济困难就更加严重了。
    美国生产过剩的危机发生后，对原料的商品储备的需求大大减少，美国垄断资本并借机操纵和压低价格，这就使拉丁美洲国家在美国市场上的原料价格不断下跌。以1958年1月同1956年1月的价格相比，铜的价格下跌了46％，锌下跌了23.1％，锡下跌了14％。纽约的咖啡牌价，由一年以前的每磅零点七八美元，跌到目前的零点四八美元。主要出口商品价格下跌的幅度这样大，这使依靠向美国输出原料作为国民收入主要来源的拉丁美洲国家的经济，受到了重大损失。据乌拉圭“人民报”今年1月估计，由于咖啡跌价，巴西每年损失两亿美元；由于铜价下跌，智利每年损失八千万美元。
    不仅如此。美国还想尽办法来减少和限制从拉丁美洲国家的进口，这也给拉丁美洲国家经济带来很大困难。例如，美国政府借口国内石油生产过剩，竭力要求委内瑞拉“自动”限制向美国输出石油。尽管委内瑞拉政府反对这个措施，但是，艾森豪威尔还是发布了行政命令，规定从4月1日起，现在输入原油的石油公司必须把采购量减少15％。这样一来，委内瑞拉每天不得不削减14％的产油量和损失二十五万美元。此外，美国还准备提高有色金属进口的关税，这对输出有色金属的智利、秘鲁、玻利维亚、墨西哥的威胁极大，激起了这些国家广泛阶层的不满。智利总统伊巴涅斯就是因为美国打算恢复2％的铜的进口税而取消他预定的访美之行的。
    由于上述的原因，拉丁美洲国家在对美国的贸易往来中，出口减少，形成了巨额贸易逆差。1957年，拉丁美洲国家对美国的贸易逆差达九亿零六百万美元之巨，而1956年拉丁美洲国家对美国的贸易逆差则为三亿美元。1958年的前景更加黯淡。据估计，阿根廷1958年的贸易逆差将达三亿五千九百万美元，而1957年是一亿九千五百四十万美元。智利铜的出口，1958年将减少二亿二千五百万美元左右，使贸易逆差达九千五百万美元。1958年头三个月，巴西咖啡的输出量同1957年同期相比，减少了一百五十九万九千多包。其结果，使拉丁美洲国家的黄金外汇储备锐减。过去三年来，阿根廷的黄金外汇储备，平均每月要减少一千万美元。乌拉圭在1946年有外汇储备一亿七千七百万美元，其中有价值一亿一千九百万美元的黄金存在美国，可是到1958年，不但把这些黄金全部花光，还从乌拉圭运去十四吨以上的黄金。秘鲁在一年以前有四千万美元的外汇储备，现在下降到四百万美元。巴西在一年以前有一亿美元的外汇储备，到1958年年初只剩下不到一千万美元了。
    随着出口的减少，许多拉丁美洲国家的工农业生产急剧下降，失业人数激增。1957年，智利的工业生产降低了13％，建筑业下降40％以上，1958年1月起又把铜的生产减少10％。1957年头六个月同1956年同期相比，墨西哥的铅产量下降了16％，锌下降了19％，铜下降了54％，全国有75％的小企业倒闭了。拉丁美洲国家的失业人数目前超过了五百万人（拉丁美洲人口共计一亿八千三百万人），同美国的失业水平不相上下。
    经济情况的恶化，造成了拉丁美洲国家的严重的财政危机。这首先表现在这些国家的日益增加的预算赤字，以及因而造成的严重的通货膨胀的现象上。如阿根廷1958年的国家收入仅够国家预算（估计为七百六十亿比索）的70％。巴西1957年的预算赤字已达四百一十亿克鲁赛罗（巴西币名），1958年估计将增至四百五十亿。通货膨胀已经是拉丁美洲国家的普遍现象了。巴西政府在1958年头五个月中就增发了将近二百亿克鲁赛罗的纸币。智利在1958年头三个月中增发了一百二十亿比索的纸币，比1957年增多一倍。玻利维亚的通货膨胀情况更严重，从1952年4月到1956年12月，货币数量从一百亿玻利维亚诺（玻利维亚币名）增加到一千八百亿，而从1956年12月到1957年8月又增发了八百五十亿。
    通货膨胀的结果，引起生活费用的上涨，使劳动人民的生活更加贫困化。以1957年同1956年相比，拉丁美洲国家生活费用的增长情况如下：巴西22.5％，智利35％，阿根廷38％，哥伦比亚20％。乌拉圭仅在1957年1月到8月生活费用就上涨了24％。
    由于美国的掠夺政策和美国经济危机的冲击所造成的拉丁美洲国家的经济灾难，正在日益加深。为了摆脱这种经济灾难，拉丁美洲人民日益广泛地展开了争取民族独立的反美斗争，坚决要求本国政府奉行独立的经济和外交政策，广泛地开展争取同社会主义阵营国家发展贸易关系的运动。尽管在这个斗争的道路上还有许多障碍，但是由于拉丁美洲各国人民的觉悟日益提高，团结不断加强，这个斗争是一定会取得胜利的。拉丁美洲国家只要能够摆脱美国的经济枷锁，它们的经济情况将会得到改善，它们的民族经济将会得到很大的发展。
