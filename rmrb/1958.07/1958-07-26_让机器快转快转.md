Make the Machines Spin Faster, Faster
    Wang Jiexiong, Beijing People's Printing Factory
    My anger blazes to the sky. If the American and British imperialists were before me, I would smash them to pieces with a punch. But before me are the roaring machines, chasing after imperialism. Very well! I will turn my anger into energy, and make the machines spin faster, faster. Spin until the imperialists scram, spin until the imperialists are finished, spin until socialism is realized sooner.

    让机器快转快转
    北京人民印刷厂　王杰雄怒火冲天，假如美英帝在面前，一拳打它个稀烂。可是，在我的面前，是轰轰地机器，它正把帝国主义追赶。那好吧！就化怒火为干劲，让机器快转，快转。转得帝国主义滚蛋，转得帝国主义完蛋，转得社会主义早实现。
