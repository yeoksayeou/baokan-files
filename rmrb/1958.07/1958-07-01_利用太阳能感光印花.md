    Using Solar-Powered Photosensitive Printing

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th – Workers Zhang Dianxi, Sun Chunfa, and others from the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory have discovered a method of using solar energy for photosensitive printing. This is an extremely valuable discovery in the printing and dyeing industry.

    In their experiments, they discovered that two types of dyes, Indigosol dyes and water dyes, have extremely sensitive photosensitivity. After applying these two dyes as a base on the gray cloth, exposing the cloth surface to sunlight through a glass plate for a few seconds allows the exposed areas to reveal the pattern. This pattern is exactly the same as if it were printed. When there is no sunlight, specially made lamps can be used as a substitute.

    Once this reform is fully realized, it will bring about a great revolution in the printing and dyeing industry. It can completely eliminate many of the complex processes currently used in printing and dyeing, such as steaming, color development, and flat washing. The entire printing and dyeing process can be completed with a single, simple combined machine.

    Currently, they are experimenting with the photosensitivity of other dyes and are trying to change this printing method from a single color to multiple colors.

    利用太阳能感光印花
    据新华社上海30日电　国营上海第二印染厂工人章奠喜、孙春发等发现了利用太阳能感光印花的方法。这是印染工业上一项极有价值的发现。
    他们在试验中发现，染料中的印地科素染料和水染料两种都具有极敏锐的感光能力，只须把这两种染料在坯布上打底之后，使太阳光透过玻璃板射到布面上去，经过几秒钟时间的暴光，显花的部分就能显出图案来。这种图案和印上去的完全一样。在没有阳光的时候可以用特制的灯光代替。
    这项改革完全实现之后，将带来印染工业上的大革命，它完全可以省去目前印染中的蒸化、显印、平洗等许多繁复的工序，只要用一台简单的联合机就能完成整个印染过程。
    目前，他们正在尝试别种染料的感光能力，并设法使这种印花能从一套色变为多套色。
