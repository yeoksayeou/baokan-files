    "Homage" Flight
    An air force spokesman for the American invasion forces in Lebanon mentioned at a press conference that a large number of American air force and navy aircraft had held a "tribute to the Lebanese people" flight over Lebanon. However, the spokesman then helplessly added that the planes flew so high that the Lebanese people were unable to see this gesture of respect from the American aircraft.
    Do the troops of American imperialism show respect and friendship to the people of invaded countries? Of course not. The fact is very clear that the so-called "tribute to the Lebanese people" flight is actually a demonstration and intimidation against the Lebanese people, attempting to threaten the Lebanese people who are fighting for national independence and freedom to submit to imperialism and its agent, the Chamoun regime.
    The fact that the American planes flew at high altitude precisely illustrates what this so-called "tribute" is all about. Because the Lebanese people are not afraid of imperialist demonstrations and intimidation, they are responding to American aggression with resolute counterattacks. In the past, several American aircraft that flew "tributes" at low altitude were wounded and shot down in this way. For the sake of safety, the American invaders can only give their "tribute" at high altitude.
    As long as the American invasion troops do not withdraw from Lebanese territory for even a day, the Lebanese people will not stop fighting. Whether it is "tribute" or intimidation, it cannot change this acute antagonistic relationship.

### “致敬”飞行

    “致敬”飞行
    美国侵略黎巴嫩部队的一位空军发言人，在一次记者招待会上提起，美国的空军和海军的大批飞机曾经在黎巴嫩上空举行了一次“向黎巴嫩人民致敬”的飞行。但是，这位发言人接着却又无可奈何地说，因为飞机飞得太高了，以致没有使黎巴嫩人民能够看到美国飞机的这番敬意。
    难道美国帝国主义军队会对被侵略国家的人民表示尊敬和友谊吗？当然不会。事实很清楚，所谓“向黎巴嫩人民致敬”的飞行，实际上是对黎巴嫩人民的示威和恫吓，是企图威胁正在为民族独立和自由而战斗的黎巴嫩人民向帝国主义及其代理人夏蒙政权屈服。
    美国机群在高空飞行，正说明了所谓“致敬”是一回什么事。因为，黎巴嫩人民并不惧怕帝国主义的示威和恫吓，他们用坚决的回击来回答美国侵略活动。过去，有几架在低空“致敬”的美国飞机就是这样被击伤和击落的。美国侵略者为了安全，便只能在高空“致敬”了。
    只要美国侵略军队一天不撤出黎巴嫩领土，黎巴嫩人民就一天也不会停止斗争。“致敬”也好，恫吓也好，都改变不了这种尖锐的敌对关系。
