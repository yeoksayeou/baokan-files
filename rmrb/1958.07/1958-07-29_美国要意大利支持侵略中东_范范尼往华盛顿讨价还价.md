Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 28th: Italian Prime Minister Fanfani flew from Rome on the 27th to Washington to conspire with the US authorities about the Middle East. As previously reported, Dulles was "concerned" about Italy's "apparent lack of enthusiasm" for the US armed aggression against Lebanon, so he "invited" Fanfani to Washington, hoping to pressure Fanfani through this meeting and demand that Italy actively support the US armed aggression against Middle Eastern countries.

Before leaving for the United States, Fanfani also held talks with French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, who was visiting Rome. Agence France-Presse reported that the two countries' opinions on the Middle East situation were "very similar" during the talks.

Reports from Western news agencies indicate that, in addition to demanding that Italy actively support US armed intervention in the Middle East, Dulles also wants to use Italy's so-called "outsider" status to plot political conspiracies in the Middle East and undermine the national independence movements of Arab countries. Italy, which has been actively expanding its capital into the Middle East in recent years, also wants to use this opportunity to break through the US's plan to monopolize the Middle East. Sources say that Fanfani intends to ask the United States and Western Europe to participate in a plan to "develop" the economies of Middle Eastern and North African countries.

    美国要意大利支持侵略中东
    范范尼往华盛顿讨价还价
    据新华社28日讯　罗马消息：意大利总理范范尼27日乘飞机离罗马前往华盛顿同美国当局共同策划对中东的阴谋。前已报道，杜勒斯曾因意大利对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩“显然缺乏热情”而感到“担心”，因此他就“邀请”范范尼到华盛顿去，想通过这次会谈来向范范尼施加压力，要求意大利对美国武装侵略中东国家的行动给予积极支持。
    范范尼在动身去美国前还同到罗马访问的法国外交部长德姆维尔举行了会谈，据法新社报道说，两国在会谈中在中东形势问题上的意见“很相似”。
    西方通讯社的报道表明，杜勒斯除了要求意大利积极支持美国在中东的武装干涉以外，他还想利用意大利所谓“局外人”的身份来在中东策划政治阴谋，破坏阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动。近年来一直在积极向中东地区进行资本扩张的意大利，也想借此机会来突破美国企图独霸中东的计划。消息说，范范尼打算要求美国和西欧一起参加一个“发展”中东和北非国家经济的计划。
