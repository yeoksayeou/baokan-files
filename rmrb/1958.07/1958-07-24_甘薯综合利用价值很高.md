The comprehensive utilization value of sweet potatoes is very high.

In order to prepare for the utilization of sweet potatoes as soon as possible, we recently conducted a typical survey and believe that: in addition to promoting fresh potatoes, dried sweet potatoes, and doing a good job in storage, the continuous processing of directly extracting starch from fresh potatoes, using the residue to brew wine and refine alcohol, and using the distiller's grains to feed pigs is the best comprehensive utilization method.

We investigated the Daxinzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Pinggu County, Hebei Province. This cooperative has 900 mu of cultivated land, and 230 mu were planted with sweet potatoes this year. Based on an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu, it can produce 1.15 million jin. Calculated at four jin of sweet potatoes equivalent to one jin of grain, that's equivalent to 290,000 jin of grain. The output of other grain crops is also more than 350,000 jin. Based on the cooperative’s calculation of 600 jin of consumption per person this year (including feed), there will still be a surplus of 260,000 jin; after selling 60,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, there will still be a surplus of 200,000 jin. This is actually a surplus of 800,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes. If such a large amount of fresh sweet potatoes is stored in cellars using the old methods of previous years, spoilage is inevitable; cutting the sweet potatoes into slices and drying them will also be impossible to process completely; even if they are processed, they cannot be eaten all, and the preservation of dried sweet potatoes cannot exceed one year; taking them out to feed pigs would also be a pity. Therefore, the comrades who conducted the survey and the cooperative cadres researched a comprehensive utilization and continuous processing method for sweet potatoes.

This processing will greatly increase the value of sweet potatoes and be of great benefit to the country and the agricultural cooperative. Based on the cooperative's 800,000 jin of fresh sweet potatoes: (1) 170,000 jin of starch can be processed, and the starch can be stored for a long time and can be mixed with flour for consumption. This turns coarse grains into fine grains, which is of great benefit to alleviating the grain supply situation. (2) The residue remaining after starch processing can be used to brew 100,000 jin of wine, which can be used to refine 50,000 jin of alcohol, and the remaining distiller's grains can feed more than 1,300 pigs. (3) The income from the above three items of starch, alcohol, and fattened pigs will be at least 110,000 yuan, exceeding the cooperative's total agricultural output value. At the same time, the state can also increase its income; the alcohol tax alone will reach 2,000 yuan, while the cooperative's agricultural tax is less than 2,000 yuan.

Since fresh potatoes should not be stored for too long, they must be processed within four months in the north. Therefore, in the case of tight rural labor, it is best to semi-mechanize the entire processing process (mixing, washing, crushing, grinding, filtering). This does not require a lot of investment. The Daxinzhai Agricultural Cooperative recently bought improved stone mills from Shanghai and washing machines and slicers from Tianjin, spending only 1,200 yuan in total. The simple ceramic alcohol distillation tower has been successfully trial-produced by the Second Commercial Department, and adding the "cooking pot" used for brewing wine, it only costs 300 yuan. As for the processing operation, some young students can be drawn from the cooperative and given a little training. The cooperative also plans to use biogas and a portable steam engine as a power source, plus fifteen laborers, and can process 150,000 jin of fresh potatoes a day.

We are preparing to promote their experience in sweet potato producing areas. If agricultural cooperatives have difficulty investing in equipment, commercial departments can also consider helping to solve the problem by pre-purchasing starch, alcohol, and fattened pigs.

### 甘薯综合利用价值很高

    甘薯综合利用价值很高
    为及早做好利用甘薯的准备工作，我们最近经过典型调查后，认为：除了推销鲜薯、甘薯干和做好保管工作外，用鲜薯直接提取淀粉，用渣子酿酒提炼酒精，用酒糟喂猪的连续处理是最好的综合利用办法。
    我们调查的是河北省平谷县大辛寨农业社。这个社共有耕地九百亩，今年有二百三十亩种了甘薯。按平均亩产五千斤计算，可产一百一十五万斤。按四斤甘薯折粮一斤计算，合二十九万斤粮食。其他粮食作物的产量也在三十五万斤以上。全社今年按每人消费六百斤（包括饲料）计算，还要富余二十六万斤；除去卖余粮六万斤给国家外，还富余二十万斤。这实际上就是富余八十万斤鲜薯。这样大量的鲜薯，如按往年的老办法挖窖鲜储，难免要发生霉烂；把甘薯切成片晒干也加工不完；加工了也吃不了，而甘薯干的保存也不能超过一年；拿出喂猪，又未免可惜。因此，调查的同志同社干部研究出了对甘薯综合利用、连续处理办法。
    这个处理，将使甘薯的身价大大提高，对国家和农业社都有极大好处。按该社的八十万斤鲜薯计算：（一）可加工出淀粉十七万斤，淀粉可长期保管，可以同面粉掺和着吃。这样粗粮变细粮，对缓和粮食供应情况大有好处。（二）加工淀粉后下余的渣子，可酿酒十万斤，可用来提炼酒精五万斤，余下的酒糟可喂猪一千三百多头。（三）以上淀粉、酒精、肥猪三项的收入至少在十一万元以上，超过了该社的农业总产值。同时，国家也可以增加收入，仅酒税一项即达两千元，而这个社的农业税还不到两千元。
    由于鲜薯存放的时间不宜过长，北方在四个月内就得处理完毕。所以在农村劳动力紧张的情况下，最好整个加工过程（拌洗、粉碎、磨粉、过滤）都半机械化。这样投资并不用很多。大辛寨农业社最近从上海买到了改良石磨，从天津买到了洗涤机和切丝机，一共才花了一千二百元。陶瓷的简易的酒精蒸馏塔，第二商业部已试制成功，加上酿酒用的“烧锅”，也不过三百元就够了。至于加工操作，从社里抽调一些青年学生略加训练 即可。该社还准备用沼气和锅驼机作动力来源，再加上十五个劳动力，一天可以处理鲜薯十五万斤。
    我们准备在盛产甘薯的地区推广他们的经验。如果农业社购置设备的投资有困难，商业部门还可以考虑用预购淀粉、酒精和肥猪的办法来帮助解决。
