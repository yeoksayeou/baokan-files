	Pick Up the Pen to Fight
	By Our Correspondent Zhu Bin
	After participating in the demonstration on the 19th, the teachers and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts immediately picked up their pens to paint propaganda posters. They are determined to use their pens to strike at the American and British aggressors and use their paintings to inspire more people to support the Arab people's struggle for liberation.
	At noon on the 20th, this reporter visited the Academy of Fine Arts for an interview. The creative activities there were unprecedentedly fervent. All the tables and chairs in the classrooms upstairs and downstairs were overturned and placed aside, and the floor was covered with white paper larger than bed sheets. Teachers and students took off their shoes and lay on the paper to paint. The corridors, stairwells, and auditorium were also full of people painting. Personnel who originally worked in personnel affairs, translation, and typing were all assisting the teachers and students in their painting efforts. Some were mixing colors, and others were writing artistic characters on the painted drawings. Three young people from Shanghai, Suzhou, and other places who came to apply to the Academy of Fine Arts also participated in the painting battle. In order to improve the efficiency of painting, these older painters and young students adopted a流水作业法 (assembly line) method: first, one person used a charcoal pencil to create a draft on the paper and used an ink brush to outline the obvious contours, and then used this draft as a standard, covering it with white paper and tracing several copies to be colored separately. For paintings with larger dimensions, they also separated the coloring after composing the draft. On the 20th alone, more than one hundred teachers and students each painted an average of one large mural with an area of ​​six square meters, which was twice as efficient as usual. Propaganda painter Zhou Lingzhao, while directing the entire painting work, conceived and created. He had just created a painting of a handful of aggressors trembling under the flags of peace-loving and democratic countries, and then created a large painting with the theme of the people of the world supporting the Arab people's struggle for liberation.
	Every teacher and student participating in the painting was filled with anger towards imperialism. Yang Li, a fifth-year student in the printmaking department, painted many huge hands of the working people, raising a large ram to hit Eisenhower, who was frightened and fell to the ground. A teacher from the colored ink painting department painted an imperialist sitting on a parachute, looking down at the territory of a Middle Eastern country. The ground was covered with oil, but when he descended from the parachute, everything he faced became sharp knives. Some students also painted pictures of the people of the Middle East stirring up a huge wave of anger to drown the imperialists, with the eye-catching four large artistic characters "Drown Them" written on it.
	As soon as the teachers and students finished painting a piece, they carried ladders to the streets to post them. At the south entrance of Wangfujing Street, traditional Chinese painter Shi Yegong, with his trouser legs rolled up, stood on a ladder, brushing paste onto the billboard. Wang Zengfu, the head of the personnel department who did not know how to paint, and two typists held the ladder for him and handed him the drawing paper. In the scorching sun, they were drenched in sweat, but no one cared to wipe it off. By 9:00 p.m., East and West Chang'an Avenue, Wangfujing Street, and the vicinity of Beihai Park were plastered with anti-aggression propaganda paintings they had created every ten meters. On the 20th alone, the various paintings completed by the teachers and students of this academy, when converted into ordinary newsprint, amounted to more than 1,000 sheets, and used up 80 kilograms of paint, and the paste used to post these paintings was also more than 300 kilograms. Many people had not rested for a moment from the evening of the 19th to the evening of the 20th.

    拿起笔来战斗
    本报记者  朱彬
    中央美术学院的师生在19日参加示威游行后，立即拿起笔来画宣传画，他们决心以自己的笔来打击美英侵略者，用自己的画来激发起更多群众支援阿拉伯人民的解放斗争。
    20日中午，记者来到美术学院进行采访，那里的创作活动真是空前的沸腾，楼上楼下所有教室的桌子、椅子都被翻放在一边，地上铺着一幅幅比床单还要大的白纸，教师们、学生们脱了鞋子伏在纸上在绘画。走廊上、楼梯口以及礼堂里也排满了画画的人。原来从事人事工作的、翻译工作的、打字工作的人员，都在为绘画的师生作助手，有的在调色，有的在画好图的画上写美术字。从上海、苏州等地来投考美术学院的三位青年，也参加了画画的战斗工作。为了提高绘画的效率，这些年老的画家和年青的学生，采用了流水作业法：先由一个人用墨炭笔在纸上打底稿，并用墨笔勾出显明的轮廓，然后以这一幅底稿为标准，用白纸蒙上再描出几幅来分头涂色。篇幅比较大的画，他们构好底图后也分开涂色。20日一天，一百多师生平均每人都画出了一幅六平方公尺篇幅的大壁画，比平时的效率高了一倍。宣传画画家周令钊，一面指挥着整个的绘画工作，一面构思创作，刚刚创作了一小撮侵略者，在爱好和平民主的各国国家的国旗下发抖的画，接着又创作了以全世界人民支援阿拉伯人民解放斗争为题的大幅画的画稿。
    每一个参加绘画的教师和学生的心中，都充满了对帝国主义的怒火。板画系五年级学生杨澧，画了许多劳动人民的巨手，举起一个大夯向吓倒在地上的艾森豪威尔打去。彩墨画系的教师画了一个帝国主义分子坐在跳伞上，向中东国家的领土看去，地上是一片石油，而当他从跳伞上降下来时，他所面临的一切又都成了尖刀。有的学生还画了中东人民激起狂怒的巨浪淹死帝国主义的画，上面写着触目惊心的“淹死他们”的四个大美术字。
    师生们画好了一幅，便搬着梯子到大街上去贴。在王府井大街的南口，国画家史冶公卷着裤脚管站在梯子上，向广告牌上刷浆糊，不会绘画的人事科长王增夫和两个打字员，给他扶梯子递画纸。在灼人的炎日下，他们全身汗如雨淋，但谁也顾不得擦。到晚间九时，东、西长安街、王府井大街、北海公园的附近，每隔十公尺就贴上了一幅他们创作的反对侵略的宣传画。20日一天，这个学院的师生们所完成的各种画，折合成普通的白报纸就达一千多张，用掉的颜料有八十斤，而张贴这些画所用的浆糊也有三百多斤。很多人从19日晚到20日晚还没有休息过一刻钟。
