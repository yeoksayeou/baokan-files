Where There Are Construction Sites, There Should Be Vegetables

Vegetables are closely related to the daily lives of the people. To improve the supply of vegetables, various regions have made many efforts. Now, the situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production has put forward new requirements for vegetable production and supply. To this end, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued instructions, requiring all regions to strengthen leadership over vegetable production and supply and to do a good job in sowing autumn vegetables in a timely manner.

At present, the vegetable production of major cities and key industrial and mining areas in the north has increased, the supply of vegetables is sufficient, and vegetable prices are stable. This is a good phenomenon. However, the vegetable supply in many large cities in the south and small cities across the country, especially in new industrial and mining areas and new construction sites, is still tight. In order to adapt to the new situation in which the people's need for vegetables is rapidly increasing during the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, all regions should make positive arrangements for vegetable production and supply.

In the great leap forward of socialist construction, due to the construction of a large number of factories, mines, and railway and highway enterprises in various regions, and the construction of countless water conservancy projects in the vast rural areas, the population of towns, emerging industrial and mining areas, and water conservancy construction sites is rapidly concentrated. Therefore, the need for vegetables has not only increased, but also become more concentrated. This trend is still developing. For example, Cao County and Dingtao County in Shandong Province will mobilize tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people for water conservancy construction; Hebei Province needs to concentrate three million people to fundamentally control the Haihe River. For these large concentrated populations, an appropriate amount of vegetables must be supplied every day. If calculated based on one catty of fresh vegetables and six taels of salted vegetables per person per day, the population participating in new construction site construction nationwide this winter and next spring alone will need to be supplied with at least 12 billion catties of fresh vegetables and 4.5 billion catties of salted vegetables in five months. At the same time, the demand for vegetables in cities and existing industrial and mining areas across the country will also increase with the rapid development of industry and the increase of urban population. In order to cooperate with and promote the great leap forward in socialist construction, it is necessary to increase the production of more vegetables to meet the needs of urban and rural people, so that where there are construction sites, there are vegetables to eat; where there are factories, vegetables are grown!

In order to effectively solve the problem of vegetable supply, first of all, there must be an active vegetable production and marketing plan. In the past, when arranging vegetable planting areas, some cities were always afraid of too many vegetables, thinking that if they planted too much, there would be a surplus during the peak season, and as a result, there were always not enough vegetables to eat. This is a conservative ideology. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council require in their instructions that general areas should plan vegetable planting areas according to their actual needs. This planting area should also have a certain "safety factor," so that there will be no vegetable panic once a natural disaster occurs. Some cities have not thoroughly implemented the policy that increasing vegetable and other non-staple food production to supply the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas near the city should be an important task in suburban production, focusing on grain production but neglecting vegetable production, so that the urban vegetable supply work has not been significantly improved. This situation should be changed quickly. The instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council say: Areas with conditions should plan to establish their own vegetable production bases to achieve local production and local supply. It is not very difficult to do this. In the past, the vegetable supply in cities and industrial and mining areas in Heilongjiang Province was very tight for a long time, and vegetable prices were high. This year, thanks to the early and good leadership of the leading organs, with indicators and measures, the supply and variety of vegetables this year have increased a lot compared to last year. For example, after May this year, the daily supply of vegetables was 2.28 million catties, an increase of half compared to the same period last year, and the average price of vegetables dropped by three to five cents per catty. Heilongjiang Province plans to increase the planting area of autumn vegetables by 49.44% more than last year, with an increase in output of 157.2%, with an average of three catties of vegetables per person per day. In this way, the vegetable supply in this province will be further improved soon. Heilongjiang Province is the region with the shortest vegetable production time. Since this province can significantly improve vegetable production and supply in a very short period of time, why can't other regions with similar or better conditions do it? In addition, the vegetable supply problem of some large construction sites must be arranged as early as possible. The Taohe River Water Conservancy Project site in Gansu Province has drawn 5%-10% of the migrant workers to grow vegetables locally to supply all the migrant workers with vegetables. This practice is also worth learning from various construction sites.

Not only the vegetable supply in cities and industrial and mining areas needs to be properly arranged, but also the vegetable production in rural areas needs to be properly arranged. In the past, farmers grew their own vegetables and ate them themselves. After the upsurge in agricultural production, the number of collective work attendance has greatly increased, and the vegetable yield on private plots has decreased. After the establishment of public canteens by agricultural cooperatives, the problem of eating vegetables has also occurred. There are a total of 1,400 production brigades in agricultural cooperatives in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, and 1,350 teams have established public canteens. The large amount of vegetables needed by public canteens cannot be supplied by individual households growing vegetables. In short, the new situation requires agricultural cooperatives to make unified arrangements for vegetable production, that is, to plan a certain vegetable planting area according to actual needs, and when necessary, professional vegetable production teams or production groups can be established to be responsible for supplying the vegetables needed by the members.

The season for sowing autumn vegetables is approaching. "Eating vegetables in winter and spring depends on one autumn." If we do not make the greatest efforts to do a good job in autumn vegetable production now, the days this winter and next spring will not be easy. We must not let this important season pass. The most important thing is to complete a certain area of ​​sowing tasks in accordance with the active production plan. At the same time, farmers should be encouraged to use all possible edges and corners of the land to grow vegetables. Vegetables can also be intercropped in the fields. Fengrun County, Hebei Province, adopts "three-crop intercropping" of potatoes, corn, and Chinese cabbage, with a general yield of 850 catties of grain and 9,000 catties of Chinese cabbage per mu, which is higher than the harvest of general fields. In addition, government agencies, troops, and schools should also use vacant land to grow vegetables as much as possible. The main difficulty in sowing autumn vegetables at present is the shortage of vegetable seeds in many areas. The most effective way to overcome this difficulty is to mobilize the masses to collect vegetable seeds, supplemented by mutual adjustment between regions. It is not a good way to reach out and ask for seeds from above. After expanding the planting area, we must also strive to increase the yield per unit area. Vegetables are high-yield crops, and there are many high-yield models with tens of thousands of catties of vegetables per mu, but there are also some areas where vegetable yields are very low. This requires earnestly summarizing and universally promoting high-yield experience to achieve large-scale bumper harvests. This work is especially important in newly opened vegetable planting areas.

Organizing the production and marketing of vegetables is a common task of several economic departments. In order to support vegetable production and master more sources of goods, business operation departments should be actively responsible, achieve large-scale purchases and sales, expand processing and storage, and also mobilize the strength of the masses to process dried vegetables and salted vegetables to meet the needs of urban and rural people.

　　哪里有工地，哪里有菜吃
    蔬菜和人民日常生活关系很大，为了改善蔬菜供应状况，各地曾经作了很多努力。现在，全国工农业生产大跃进的形势，又向蔬菜生产和供应工作提出了新的要求。为此，中共中央和国务院联合发出指示，要求各地加强对蔬菜生产和供应工作的领导，适时地做好秋菜播种工作。
    目前北方各大城市和重点工矿区的蔬菜产量增加了，蔬菜供应量充足，菜价平稳。这是好现象。但是，南方许多大城市和全国小城市，特别是新工矿区、新工地的蔬菜供应仍然紧张。为了适应工农业生产大跃进的时期人民对于蔬菜的需要迅速增长的新情况，各地都应当在蔬菜生产和供应上做积极的安排。
    在社会主义建设大跃进中，由于大量的厂矿企业和铁路公路正在各地建设，无数的水利工程正在广大农村中兴修，城镇、新兴工矿区和水利建设工地的人口迅速地集中起来。因此，蔬菜的需要不但增加了，而且更为集中了。目前这种趋势还在发展。比如山东省曹县、定陶县在水利建设上将调动几万以至十几万人力；河北省为根治海河，就需要集中三百万人。对于这些大量集中的人口，必需每天供应适量的蔬菜。如果按每人每天供应一斤鲜菜、六两咸菜计算，光是今冬明春全国参加新工地建设的人口，五个月中就至少需要供应鲜菜一百二十亿斤、咸菜四十五亿斤。同时，全国城镇和现有工矿区对蔬菜的需要量也将随着工业的迅速发展和城市人口的增加而增加。为了配合和促进社会主义建设的大跃进，必须增产更多的蔬菜，供应城乡人民的需要，做到哪里有工地，哪里有菜吃；哪里有工厂，哪里就种菜！
    为了切实解决蔬菜供应问题，首先要有一个积极的蔬菜产销规划。过去有些城市在安排蔬菜播种面积的时候，总是怕菜多，以为种多了，到了上市盛期就会过剩，结果总是蔬菜不够吃。这是一种保守思想。中共中央和国务院在指示中要求一般地区都根据当地的实际需要，规划蔬菜播种面积。这种播种面积还要有一定的“安全系数”，这样才不至于一旦发生自然灾害而闹蔬菜恐慌。有些城市在郊区生产上，没有彻底贯彻城市附近和工矿区附近应该把增产蔬菜等副产品供应城市和工矿区需要作为重要任务的方针，对粮食生产抓得紧，对蔬菜生产抓得松，以致城市蔬菜供应工作没有显著的改善。这种情况应当迅速改变。中共中央和国务院的指示中说：有条件的地区都应当有计划地建立自己的蔬菜生产基地，做到就地生产，就地供应。要做到这点，并不是很困难的。黑龙江省城市和工矿区过去长时期蔬菜供应很紧张，菜价昂贵；今年由于领导机关对蔬菜抓得早、抓得好，有指标，有措施，今年蔬菜的供应量和品种比去年增加了很多。如今年5月以后每天蔬菜上市量二百二十八万斤，比去年同期增加了一半，菜价平均每斤下降了三分到五分。黑龙江省计划今年秋菜播种面积较去年增加49.44％多，产量增加157.2％，平均每人每天可吃菜三斤。这样，这个省的蔬菜供应不久将有进一步的改善。黑龙江省是蔬菜生产时间最短的地区，既然这个省能够在很短的时期内显著地改善蔬菜生产和供应状况，其他条件差不多或者更好的地区为什么办不到呢？此外，有些大的建设工地的蔬菜供应问题，更必须早作安排。甘肃洮河水利工程工地抽出5％—10％的民工来就地种菜，供应全体民工吃菜。这个做法也值得各个工地学习。
    不但城市和工矿区的蔬菜供应需要妥善安排，农村的蔬菜生产也需要妥善安排。过去农民都是一家一户自己种菜自己吃。在农业生产高潮出现以后，集体出工数量大大增加了，自留地上的蔬菜产量减少了。农业合作社设立公共食堂之后，也发生了吃菜的问题。河南省登封县全县农业合作社共有一千四百个生产大队，已有一千三百五十个队建立了公共食堂。公共食堂所需要的大量的蔬菜，靠单家独户种菜是供应不上的。总之，新的情况要求农业合作社对于蔬菜生产做统一的安排，就是说，要根据实际需要规划一定的蔬菜种植面积，必要的时候，可以成立专业性的蔬菜生产队或生产组，负责供应社员所需要的蔬菜。
    秋菜播种的季节就要到了。“冬春吃菜靠一秋。”如果现在不用最大的努力做好秋菜生产，今冬明春的日子就不好过了。我们千万不要让这个重要季节错过了。首要的一件事是必须按照积极的生产计划，完成一定面积的播种任务。同时应当鼓励农民利用一切可能利用的地边地角来种菜。大田里也可以套种蔬菜。河北省丰润县采用马铃薯、玉米、大白菜“三茬套作”，一般亩产粮食八百五十斤、大白菜九千斤，高于一般大田的收获。此外，机关、部队、学校也应当尽可能利用空地种菜。目前秋菜播种中的主要困难，是许多地区蔬菜种籽不足。克服这个困难最有效的办法，是发动群众收集菜种，再辅之以地区之间的互相调剂。伸手向上面要种籽，不是好办法。扩大了播种面积，还要力争提高单位面积产量。蔬菜是高产作物，亩产几万斤菜的高产典型很多，但是也有一些地区蔬菜产量很低。这就需要认真总结和普遍推广高产经验，实现大面积的丰产。这一工作在新开辟的蔬菜种植地区尤其重要。
    组织蔬菜的产销是几个经济部门的共同任务。为了支持蔬菜生产和掌握更多的货源，业务经营部门应当积极负责，做到大购大销，扩大加工储存，同时还要动员群众的力量加工干菜、咸菜，以供应城乡人民的需要。
