    破两项自行车全国纪录
    新华社上海23日电　22日下午上海、江苏、安徽三单位在上海虹口体育场田径跑道上举行自行车对抗赛。上海运动员龚文珍在女子一千五百公尺比赛中创造了二分三十一秒七的全国最新成绩，这个成绩比全国纪录快了二秒一。上海队的金其骞也以十六分三秒七的成绩打破了十六分四秒三的男子万公尺全国纪录。
    对抗赛开始前，上午这三个单位先进行自行车测验。在上午的测验和下午的比赛中，仅女子一千五百公尺一项，就有八人达到了运动健将级标准，其中安徽的丘素云、胡小凤和江苏的宋云英、郑瑞霞、包立行五人以前还只是二级运动员或根本没有达到这个项目的等级运动员标准。最近一个时期来，她们在大跃进形势的鼓舞下积极锻炼，进步很快。
