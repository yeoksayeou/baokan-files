Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 4th: Faced with a severe shortage of foreign exchange in the execution of its Second Five-Year Plan, India is seeking more foreign loans and credits, especially from the United States.

It is reported that the Secretary for Economic Affairs, Dehejia, is currently in Washington for "exploratory" talks to obtain more US loans. These discussions are seen as preparing the ground for Finance Minister Desai's scheduled visit to the United States in September.

India and the United States have recently signed several loan agreements. The US Export-Import Bank and the Indian government signed an agreement on June 12 regarding the use of $150 million, part of the $225 million loan the US promised to provide to India, announced in January of this year. On June 23, India and the United States reached an agreement on the use of the remaining $75 million of the loan. On June 30, India and the United States also signed a $57 million loan agreement for the purchase of surplus US agricultural products. The United States and India have also signed a loan agreement for the development of iron ore mines in Orissa State, under which the United States has agreed to provide India with a $20 million loan. Compared with the 5 billion rupees of foreign aid needed by India in its Second Five-Year Plan, the above-mentioned loans are far from sufficient.

On the other hand, India's foreign exchange situation has been deteriorating continuously since this year. At the end of 1957, India's foreign exchange reserves were 2.94 billion rupees. By May of this year, these reserves had decreased to 2.42 billion rupees. Since April of this year, the foreign exchange used each week has reached 50 million rupees.

After Nehru returned from his vacation, the Cabinet held a meeting last week to discuss the urgent foreign exchange problem. As a result of the discussions, in addition to cutting the Five-Year Plan and expanding exports to earn foreign exchange, the Indian government is further restricting imports. It is reported that imports of oil and petroleum products have been further reduced to save 100 million rupees in foreign exchange.

    印度想靠美援应付外汇恶化情况
    同时削减五年计划开支和限制进口
    据新华社新德里4日电　在执行第二个五年计划中，由于外汇严重缺乏，印度正在争取更多的外国贷款和信贷，特别是来自美国方面的。
    据消息说，负责经济事务的秘书德赫鲁现在正在华盛顿进行“探测性”的商谈，以便取得更多的美国贷款。这种商谈被认为是为财政部长德赛预定在今年9月访问美国进行准备。
    印度和美国最近签订了几项贷款协定。美国进出口银行和印度政府在6月12日签订了一项关于使用一亿五千万美元的协定，这笔贷款是今年1月宣布的美国答应给印度提供的二亿二千五百万美元贷款的一部分。6月23日，印度和美国就使用其余的部分七千五百万美元贷款达成协议。6月30日，印度和美国又签订了一项关于购买美国的剩余农产品的五千七百万美元贷款的协定。美国和印度还签订了在奥里萨邦开采铁矿的贷款协定，根据这项协定，美国同意向印度提供二千万美元的贷款。和印度在第二个五年计划中所需要的五十亿卢比的外援相比较，上述这些贷款远不是足够的。
    另一方面，印度外汇情况自从今年以来一直在不断恶化。在1957年年底，印度外汇储备是二十九亿四千万卢比。到今年5月，这项储备减低到二十四亿二千万卢比。自从今年4月以来，每周所动用的外汇达到五千万卢比。
    在尼赫鲁休假回来以后，内阁在上星期举行了会议，讨论紧迫的外汇问题。讨论结果，除了对五年计划进行削减，并且扩大出口以获取外汇以外，印度政府正在进一步限制进口。据报道，已经进一步削减石油和石油制品的进口，以节约一亿卢比的外汇。
