Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 18th: After rectification, the medical science community in Shanghai broke down sectarian concepts and departmentalism, and implemented comprehensive collaboration. Based on the pressing needs in Shanghai's disease prevention and treatment and national research tasks, they jointly formulated 1,089 research topics covering schistosomiasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, tumors, traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacology, and antibiotics.

Shanghai originally had more than 70 medical research units, all with annual scientific research plans, and the number of research topics exceeded 1,000. However, due to the dispersed research of each unit, lack of communication, and many repetitions, some topics were not urgently needed. At the end of March this year, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, each unit formed 21 specialized and thematic groups, and conducted more than two months of discussions, investigations, and visits. During the discussions, the medical community exposed and criticized sectarianism and closed-door research methods, and determined the research goal of eliminating major diseases through good scientific collaboration to serve production. For example, five institutions in Shanghai were working on the research of trial-producing extracorporeal circulation artificial heart-lung machines. Everyone kept the research methods secret. Last year, the Chest Hospital first published the successful research news in the newspaper and made a report at the medical academic conference. Another unit screened a movie of their trial-produced artificial heart-lung machine at the meeting, indicating that their research had also been successful. In the search for artificial blood vessel substitutes, several units were using nylon, silk, and other materials for trial production. One unit found a factory that could weave this kind of substitute, and immediately signed a contract with the factory, only allowing them to process it and not to weave this kind of artificial blood vessel substitute for other units, which affected the research of other units. Now, the trial production of artificial heart-lung machines and the search for artificial blood vessel substitutes have been combined into one general topic. The five units that are trial-producing artificial heart-lung machines have also set up a collaboration group to unify steps, divide labor, and cooperate. Recently, it has been successfully applied to human surgery.

Through collaborative discussions and practical investigations, many researchers have understood the urgent problems to be solved in Shanghai's disease prevention and treatment, and have added many new topics. Experts who have been studying tumors in the laboratory went to the hospital to visit and saw many patients urgently awaiting treatment. One expert said that if he continued his original research, he could conduct experiments in the laboratory for 20 years, which might contribute to the theory of anti-cancer, but it would be of no use to these patients who urgently need treatment. They decided to temporarily abandon the original topic, ordered several new topics that need to be solved urgently, and cooperated with hospitals and clinics. Pharmaceutical research units also cooperated to include anti-cancer and tumor-treating drugs into the research plan.

Due to the joint research of all units in the city, many topics can be completed earlier than the originally scheduled time, and the quality can be greatly improved. Occupational skin diseases have been investigated separately by medical colleges and prevention and treatment institutes for several years, but so far no one has complete data. Now, after unified arrangements, research strength has been increased, and it can be completed within five years, and prevention and treatment methods for this occupational disease can also be proposed. At present, the number of units in the city's medical community participating in research has expanded from 75 to 239.

### 大破宗派主义开门研究  上海医药科学界全面大协作

    大破宗派主义开门研究
    上海医药科学界全面大协作
    据新华社上海18日电　上海医药科学界经过整风以后，打破宗派观念和本位主义，实行全面大协作，根据上海防治疾病中迫切需要解决的问题和国家研究任务，共同制订了包括血吸虫病、肺结核病、心脏血管病、肿瘤、中医中药和抗生素等方面的一千零八十九个研究题目。
    上海原有七十多个医药研究单位都订有年度的科学研究计划，研究题目也超过一千以上。由于各单位分散研究，互不通气，重复很多；其中还有一些题目，并不是当前迫切需要的。今年3月底，各单位在中共上海市委领导下，组成二十一个专科、专题小组，进行了两个多月的讨论、调查、参观。在讨论中，医学界揭发和批判了宗派主义以及闭门研究的工作方法，并且确定以搞好科学协作关系消灭主要疾病，为生产服务的研究目标。例如试制体外循环的人工心肺机器这一项研究，上海有五个机构都在进行。对于研究的方法，大家都严守秘密。去年胸科医院在报纸上首先发表研究成功的消息，并在医学学术会议上作报告，当场就有另一单位在会上放映了他们试制人工心肺机器的电影，表示他们的研究也已经成功。在找寻人造血管代用品的研究中，好几个单位在用尼龙、丝绸等试制。有一个单位找到一家工厂会编织这种代用品，立即同工厂订下合同，只准他们加工，不能再替别的单位织制这种人造血管代用品，使其它单位的研究受到影响。现在试制人工心肺和找寻人造血管代用品，都只订成一个总的题目，试制人工心肺的五个单位还专门成立了一个协作小组，统一步骤，分工合作。最近已经初步成功地应用在人体手术上。
    通过协作讨论，实际调查，许多研究工作者了解了上海防治疾病中迫切需要解决的问题，增加了许多新题目。一直在实验室中研究肿瘤的专家，到医院去参观以后，看到许多病人急待治疗。有一个专家说，如果像原来的研究，他可以在实验室作二十年的实验，可能对抗癌的理论上有一点点贡献，但是对于这些目前急需治疗的病人却一点没有用处。他们决定暂时放弃原来的题目，订了好几个目前急需解决的新题目，并同医院、诊所协作共同进行。制药研究单位也配合把抗癌和治疗肿瘤的药物订入研究计划。
    由于全市各单位共同协作研究，许多题目都能比过去所订的期限提早完成，而且质量可以大大提高。职业性皮肤病曾有医学院和防治所等单位分别作了几年调查，可是至今谁都没有完整的资料。现在经过统一安排，增加了研究力量，在五年内就能完成，并且还可以提出对这种职业病的防治办法。目前全市医药界参加研究工作的单位已从七十五个扩大到二百三十九个。
