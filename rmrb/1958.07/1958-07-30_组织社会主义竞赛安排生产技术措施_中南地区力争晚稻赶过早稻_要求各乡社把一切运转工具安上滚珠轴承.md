Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: This year's late rice must exceed early rice, and at the same time, we must firmly grasp next year and accelerate the preparation for agricultural production next year to strive to basically solve the grain problem next year. This is the requirement put forward by the agricultural cooperation conference of the Central South region for this region.

The meeting was presided over by Chen Zhenren, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. The meeting was attended by the provincial Party secretaries in charge of agriculture from Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and the heads of relevant departments from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and various provinces. The meeting lasted for nine days and ended on the 24th.

The five provinces (and region) of Central South China have reaped unprecedented harvests of spring and summer crops this year. Among them, the total output of 96.5 million mu of early rice can reach 44.5 billion jin, an increase of more than double compared with last year, with an average yield of 460 jin per mu. The unprecedented harvest of spring and summer crops has promoted the great liberation of the minds of the broad masses of peasants, and striving for the upper reaches and striving for the first place have become mass movements. The meeting believes that it is timely to put forward the requirement that late rice should exceed early rice on such a basis, and it is entirely possible to strive for a greater leap forward next year.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year and a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year, the meeting believes that the following measures must be taken on the basis of firmly grasping political leadership, carrying out technological revolution, and launching mass movements: 1. Combine the summer harvest and the summarization of summer harvest high-yield experience to do a good job in ideological mobilization for striving for a greater autumn harvest. Through the summer harvest comparison and competition summary, further boost morale and continue to carry out socialist emulation drives. The main requirements of the competition are to ensure a comprehensive and large-scale increase in production, while striving for high-yield "satellites" to go into the sky. 2. Transplant late rice in a timely manner. The number of seedlings for dense planting of late rice can be increased to 40,000, 50,000, or more depending on water, fertilizer, and soil conditions. 3. Fully prepare for drought prevention and vigorously do a good job in flood prevention. Strive to ensure a bumper harvest even if it doesn't rain. Prevent and control pests and diseases of late rice and late autumn crops as early as possible. 4. Launch a surprise attack on fertilizer production. In addition to farm manure, townships, communes, and teams should launch a surprise attack on the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers. 5. Continue to vigorously reform agricultural tools. Install ball bearings in all rotating tools and universally promote them to townships and communes before the autumn harvest. 6. Pay attention to selecting good seeds, and conscientiously do a good job in the preservation and regulation of seeds. Establish good seed institutions at all levels. 7. Deeply plow the land. Rotate plowing or layer-by-layer gradual deep plowing should be carried out according to local conditions and different crops. 8. After the autumn harvest, vigorously carry out agricultural capital construction centered on water conservancy and fertilizer production, and strive to basically eliminate general water and drought disasters in another winter and spring or two winters and springs. From August to October, cadres from the province to the commune at six levels should jointly meet and go deep into the fields to work with the peasants to do a good job in field management, and never leave the fields until a comprehensive and bumper harvest is achieved. 10. After the autumn harvest, carry out a rectification and commune consolidation movement with the theme of deeply publicizing the general line, publicizing the victory of the Great Leap Forward, summarizing socialist emulation drives, and formulating long-term plans.

The meeting specifically summarized the experience of large-scale increases in spring and summer crops this year. In terms of leadership, these experiences mainly include political leadership, carrying out technological revolution, and organizing large-scale mass movements. Organizing socialist emulation drives between regions, collectives, and individuals on the basis of clear goals, specific content, and full ideological mobilization is the main form of launching and forming mass movements. In terms of technical measures, the meeting summarized the experience in expanding the planting area of early rice, early sowing, promoting dense planting, strengthening field management, and universally promoting good varieties.

The mountainous area of the five provinces (and region) in Central South China accounts for 62% of the total area, and most of them are old revolutionary base areas. The meeting proposed: work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of the mountainous areas, comprehensively develop the production of the mountainous areas, and make the economic life of the mountainous areas catch up with or surpass the plains areas.

The meeting also discussed issues such as deep plowing of land, promotion of japonica rice, timber production, tool reform, rectification and commune consolidation, and agricultural cooperation among the five provinces (and region). On the last day of the meeting, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui attended the meeting and gave instructions.

    组织社会主义竞赛安排生产技术措施
    中南地区力争晚稻赶过早稻
    要求各乡社把一切运转工具安上滚珠轴承
    据新华社南昌29日电　今年晚稻必须超过早稻，同时要狠狠地抓明年，加紧明年农业生产的准备工作，争取明年基本解决粮食问题。这是中南地区的农业协作会议对这个地区提出的要求。
    会议由中共中央农村工作部副部长陈正人主持。出席会议的有中共广东、湖北、湖南、江西四省负责农业的省委书记，广西僮族自治区及各省有关部门的负责人。会议开了九天，24日结束。
    中南五省（区）今年春夏作物空前丰收。其中九千六百五十万亩早稻总产量可达四百四十五亿斤，比去年增长一倍以上，亩产平均四百六十斤。春夏作物的空前丰收促进了广大农民思想的大解放，力争上游、力争第一已成为群众性的运动。会议认为在这样的基础上提出晚稻超过早稻的要求是适时的，争取明年更大的跃进是完全可能的。
    为了争取今年秋季作物的大丰收和明年农业生产更大的跃进，会议认为，必须在抓紧政治挂帅、搞好技术革命和群众运动的基础上采取如下措施：一、结合夏收和总结夏收丰产经验，做好争取秋季更大丰收的思想动员。经过夏收评比竞赛的总结，进一步鼓足干劲，继续开展社会主义竞赛。竞赛的主要要求是保证全面大增产，同时争取高额丰产的“卫星”上天。二、及时插好晚稻。晚稻密植蔸数，根据水、肥、土条件，可以增加到四万、五万或更多。三、充分准备防旱，大力搞好防汛。争取天不再下雨也能大部保证丰收。及早防治晚稻晚秋作物的虫害。四、突击搞肥料，除农家肥料外，乡乡社社队队要突击大搞土化肥。五、继续大力改革农具，在一切运转工具中安装滚珠轴承，在秋收前普遍推广到乡社。六、重视选择优良种籽，认真作好种籽的保存和调剂工作。建立各级良种机构。七、深翻土地。分年轮翻或分层逐步深翻，各地可因地因作物不同而制宜。八、秋后大搞以水利和制造肥料为中心的农业基本建设，争取再有一个冬春或两个冬春基本消灭一般水旱灾害。8、9、10三个月，由省到社六级干部应共同会师深入田间，同农民一道搞好田间管理，不实现全面大丰收决不离开田间。十、秋后进行一次以深入宣传总路线、宣传大跃进胜利、总结社会主义竞赛、制定远景规划为内容的整风整社运动。
    会议具体地总结了今年春夏季作物大增产的经验。这些经验，在领导方面主要是政治挂帅、搞技术革命和组织大规模的群众运动。在目标鲜明、内容具体、思想发动充分的基础上，组织地区之间、集体之间、个人之间的社会主义竞赛，是发动和形成群众运动的主要形式。在技术措施方面，会议总结了扩大早稻种植面积、提早播种、推行密植、加强田间管理、普遍推行良种等方面的经验。
    中南五省（区）山区面积占总面积的62％，而且大都是老革命根据地。会议提出：苦战三年，基本改变山区面貌，使山区的生产得到全面开发，使山区的经济生活赶上或超过平原地区。
    会议并就深翻土地、推广粳稻、木材生产、工具改革以及整风整社、五省（区）农业协作等问题进行了讨论。会议最后一天，国务院副总理邓子恢到会作了指示。
