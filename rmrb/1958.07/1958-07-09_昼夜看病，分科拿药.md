    Day and Night Medical Treatment, Departmentalized Medicine Dispensing
    In order to facilitate patients' medical treatment, the Qiqihar City First Hospital recently implemented a year-round day and night outpatient service system, allowing patients to seek medical treatment as soon as they arrive. The emergency service system has been abolished, and patients with serious illnesses can seek treatment in advance. In order to shorten patients' waiting time, the hospital has also implemented departmentalized registration, departmentalized storage of medical records, and departmentalized medicine dispensing, greatly facilitating patients.
    Hospital leaders have also improved their leadership style. The president and the Party General Branch secretary and other leading cadres have adopted a one-stop leadership method of dividing up responsibilities and taking charge of specific areas (from outpatient clinics to wards), which is welcomed by the majority of hospital staff.

    昼夜看病，分科拿药
    齐齐哈尔市第一医院为了便利患者就医，最近实行了全年日夜门诊制，患者可随到随就诊，取消了急诊制度，有重病时，可提前看。为了缩短患者的候诊时间，又实行了分科挂号、分科保管病志、分科取药的办法，大大便利了患者。
    医院领导上，也改进了领导作风，院长、党总支书记领导干部采取了分片包干的一条龙（从门诊到病房）的领导方法，受到广大医院职工的欢迎。
