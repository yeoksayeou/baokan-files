Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 28th (TASS): According to a report from Los Angeles in "People's World," the convention of the "California Federation of Young Democrats," a youth organization of the U.S. Democratic Party, passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from Lebanon.

The resolution believes that the decision to send U.S. armed forces to Lebanon was a "mistake." It states: "This decision has unnecessarily and without justification brought the world to the brink of a third world war... It has exacerbated tensions in the Near and Middle East and made a lasting political solution more difficult. Based on the facts presented in the United Nations report and the United Nations Charter, the U.S. government's decision is unjustified."

The convention also passed a resolution calling for a "complete ban on nuclear testing."

    民主党一青年组织
    要求美军撤出中东
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：据“人民世界报”自洛杉矶报道，美国民主党青年组织“加利福尼亚州青年民主党人联合会”代表大会以压倒多数票通过决议，要求美国武装部队立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    决议认为，美国派武装部队到黎巴嫩的决定是一个“错误”。它说：“这个决定毫无理由也毫无必要地把世界引向了第三次世界大战的边缘……它加剧了中近东的紧张局势，使持久的政治解决变得更加困难。就联合国报告中陈述的事实和联合国宪章而论，美国政府的这个决定是没有道理的。”
    代表大会还通过一项决议，要求“完全禁止核试验”。
