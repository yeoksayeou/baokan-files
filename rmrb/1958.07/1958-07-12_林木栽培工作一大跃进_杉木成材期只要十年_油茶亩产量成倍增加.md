A Great Leap Forward in Afforestation
Chinese Fir Maturing in Just Ten Years, Camellia Yields Per Acre Doubling

    (Our dispatch) Following the upsurge in spring afforestation, a mass movement for rapid growth and high-yield afforestation has been launched in many areas of southern China.

    The various counties of the Guizhou Province's Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have historically been known for the rapid growth of Chinese fir, with some Chinese fir maturing in eighteen years, about ten years earlier than other regions, hence the nickname "Eighteen Fir." Recently, a high-speed movement to cultivate timber forests, striving for Chinese fir to mature in ten years, has emerged in this area. Leading cadres of the Jinping County Party Committee conducted in-depth visits to many districts, townships, communes, and forest lands, investigating high-yield situations and summarizing high-yield experiences. In more than 130 communes, they discovered many ten-year firs, eleven-year firs, and thirteen-year firs, indicating that maturation in ten years is possible. Subsequently, the County Party Committee organized thirty-three on-site visits, with 12,500 people going to Wanfeng Commune, Datong Commune, and Guazhi Commune to learn and exchange experiences. Through these visits, everyone realized that it is entirely possible to shorten the maturation period of Chinese fir by half, as long as a series of tasks such as land preparation, planting, tending, and fertilization are carried out well. Suxikou in Huitong County, Hunan Province, has a thirty-year-old Chinese fir forest with a timber storage capacity of 70 cubic meters per mu. Last winter and this spring, Hunan Province put forward the slogan "Learn from Suxikou, compare with Suxikou."

    The high-yield movement for camellia has also begun. The average tea oil yield per mu of camellia forests nationwide is less than ten jin, but provinces such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan have successively seen high-yield models with yields of 50 jin, 100 jin, and 150 jin per mu. Zhejiang Province's camellia forest areas have launched a "Protect Tea Fruits, Strive for a Bumper Harvest" movement, vigorously carrying out land reclamation and tending. Since summer, Qingtian County has invested more than 1.05 million workdays in tasks such as clearing mountains, cultivating soil, applying fertilizer, pruning, and pest control, and has also dug more than 650,000 fish-scale pits, striving to produce 20 million jin of tea seeds this year, a tenfold increase compared to 1949. In addition, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong and other provinces have also launched large-scale camellia reclamation and tending work.

It is estimated that each mu can produce 40 jin of tea oil. The picture shows commune members reclaiming the camellia forest. Xinhua News Agency manuscript

    林木栽培工作一大跃进
    杉木成材期只要十年　油茶亩产量成倍增加
    本报讯　随着春季造林高潮以后，南方许多地区掀起了群众性的林木速生高额丰产运动。
    贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州各县历来以培育杉木成材快著名，有些杉木十八年就可成材，较其他地区约提早十年左右，因此有“十八杉”的称号。最近，一个以高速度培育用材林，争取杉木十年成材的丰产运动已经在这个地区兴起。锦屏县委领导干部深入访问了很多区、乡、社和林地，调查丰产情况和总结丰产经验，在一百三十多个社中，发现许多十年杉、十一年杉、十三年杉，说明十年成材是可能的。随后，县委便组织了三十三次现场参观，有一万二千五百人到万丰社、大同社、卦治社去学习和交流经验。经过参观，大家认识到只要做好整地、栽植、抚育、施肥等一系列工作，将杉木成材期缩短一半时间是完全可能的。湖南省会同县苏溪口有三十年生的杉木林，每亩木材蓄积量已达七十立方公尺，湖南省去冬今春就提出“学苏溪口、比苏溪口”的口号。
    油茶的丰产运动也已经开始。全国油茶林亩产茶油平均不到十斤，但是浙江、福建、湖南等省先后出现了亩产五十斤、一百斤、一百五十斤等丰产的典型。浙江省各油茶林区已展开了“保茶果、争丰收”运动，大力进行垦复和抚育。青田县，夏季以来已投入了一百零五万多工，进行铲山、培土、施肥、整枝、除虫，同时还挖了六十五万多个鱼鳞坑，争取今年产茶籽二千万斤，比1949年增产十倍。此外，江西、湖南、广东等省也都大规模地开展了油茶垦复和抚育工作。
