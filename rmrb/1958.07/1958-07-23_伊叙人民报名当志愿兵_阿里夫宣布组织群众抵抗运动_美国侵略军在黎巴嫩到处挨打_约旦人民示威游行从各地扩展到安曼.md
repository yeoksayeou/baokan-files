Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Baghdad News: Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Arif stated in an interview published in the "Republic Daily" on the 21st that certain countries might take provocative acts of aggression against the Republic of Iraq, but he warned, "We will repel aggression from any direction."

Arif said that the Iraqi government's foreign policy is: "To be friendly to those who are friendly to us and to adopt a hostile attitude towards those who are hostile to us."

According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, Arif also stated on the same day that the Iraqi revolution is an internal affair. In order to defend the motherland and resist foreign aggression, a mass resistance movement must be organized in Iraq.

According to a report from the Middle East News Agency, Baghdad, July 21st: All over Iraq, people have begun to enthusiastically register at registration stations as volunteers, preparing to resist foreign aggression and defend the Republic of Iraq. Thousands of people have already registered.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 22nd: Several thousand residents of Latakia in the Syrian region sent a telegram on the 21st to the relevant authorities in Damascus, applying to serve as volunteers to combat the American and British aggressors who are armed interventionists in Middle Eastern countries. They condemned the US and British invasion of Lebanon and Jordan as acts that violate the UN Charter and human rights.

The telegram said, "Let the imperialists know that we are preparing to fight side by side with our Arab brothers in Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq to defeat the imperialists. We request to be accepted as volunteers."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 22nd: According to the Indian Press Trust, Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Salam said on the 21st that the main goal of the Lebanese National Front now is to drive all American troops out of Lebanon.

He pointed out that the American troops in Lebanon are an occupation force. He said that his forces have not attacked American troops so far, "but soon we will fight them." He said, "We will use force to deal with force."

Salam said that if necessary, another government will be formed to fight the American occupation forces. Due to the face of foreign intervention, the formation of another government has become an urgent possibility. He also said, "We will need outside assistance in order to fight foreign troops on our land."

Speaking of the Shamun regime's attempt to hold a parliamentary meeting on July 24 to elect a new president, he pointed out that the election is meaningless until foreign troops are driven out.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Beirut News: The Lebanese people have shot down and injured several American aggressor planes that have repeatedly flown low to provoke them.

An American aggressor air force spokesman admitted today that in the Beirut area alone, sixteen American military aircraft have been hit by gunfire from the Lebanese rebel forces, some of which were badly damaged and could not take off. Prior to this, an American military aircraft was shot down by Lebanese rebels on the 19th, ten miles east of Beirut, and crashed in the mountains.

Another American aggressor spokesman also revealed that American reconnaissance planes taking off from the Sixth Fleet's aircraft carrier had been shot at sixteen times by Lebanese rebel forces near Tripoli.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 21st: According to a Middle East News Agency reporter in Beirut, Jumblatt, commander of the rebel forces in the Shouf Mountains of Lebanon, has sent a telegram to the Supreme Power Committee of Iraq, congratulating them on the victory of the Iraqi revolution.

In his congratulatory telegram, Jumblatt said that the Iraqi army's uprising against imperialism and violent rule is the happiest thing for the Arabs. The telegram said, "Seeing you, we feel more confident in finally defeating imperialism and its agents."

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Hamburg News: Jumblatt, leader of the Lebanese opposition Social Progressive Party (formerly translated as the Socialist Progressive Party), told a reporter from the West German "Bild" newspaper, "We don't want a new president who relies on American alms." He said, "If this (presidential) election is to have any meaning, the Americans must withdraw."

"Bild" published Jumblatt's remarks on the 21st. Jumblatt also said, "We will not sit idly by for much longer, and the whole world will see that we do not want them (American aggressor troops) to stay here." He said that American armed intervention in Lebanon "has greatly strengthened our position, because due to this intervention, tens of thousands of more people have recently supported us."

The Lebanese presidential election is scheduled to be held on July 24. While sending troops to invade Lebanon, the United States is allowing Murphy, a veteran schemer from the State Department, to use threats and inducements in Beirut in an attempt to get the opposition to accept a plan to elect a pro-American presidential successor to replace Shamun.

Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: Beirut News: The American troops invading Lebanon have found themselves surrounded by local people hostile to them, and even children in the Lebanese capital are trying to punish them.

An Associated Press reporter acknowledged in a message from Beirut on the 20th that the US Marines and paratroopers invading Lebanon are worried about two things day and night: snipers from the Lebanese rebel forces shooting at American guards and aircraft, and "mischief by Lebanese children selling soda."

The American reporter reported that in a basket of Coca-Cola given to an American sentry by a Lebanese child, one bottle exploded, "The bottle was filled with gasoline and had a timed explosive device." An army spokesman for the American aggressor troops said on the 20th, "Our security personnel are being harassed by these little guys and their soda." It was also reported that a US Marine had three fingers blown off in an explosion while heating a field ration. "It is believed that the explosive was placed in the fuel."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 21st: The Republic of Iraq Radio broadcast tonight a message from Amman saying that demonstrations by the Jordanian people against the current regime in Jordan have spread to the Jordanian capital Amman. Earlier news said that demonstrations had been held throughout Jordan, especially in the West Bank.

The radio station also said that as the Jordanian people's struggle is developing, King Hussein of Jordan has requested British occupation forces to send tank units to guard the Amman Palace and other places. (Attached picture)

    据新华社22日讯  巴格达消息：伊拉克副总理阿里夫21日在“共和国报”发表谈话指出，某些国家会对伊拉克共和国采取挑衅性的侵略行动，但是他警告说，“我们将击退来自任何方面的侵略。”
    阿里夫说，伊拉克政府的外交政策是：“同对我们友好的人友好，对敌视我们的人抱敌对态度”。
    另据开罗电台广播，阿里夫在同一天还发表谈话说，伊拉克革命是内政问题。为了保卫祖国，抗击外国侵略，必须在伊拉克组织群众抵抗运动。
    据中东通讯社巴格达21日消息：在伊拉克全国各地，人们开始踊跃地到报名站登记作志愿兵，准备抵抗外国侵略以保卫伊拉克共和国。已经有数以千计的人办了登记。
    新华社大马士革22日电  叙利亚地区的拉塔基亚的几千名居民21日打电报给大马士革的有关当局，申请作为志愿军来打击武装干涉中东国家的美英侵略者。他们谴责美国和英国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦是破坏联合国宪章和人类权利的行为。
    电报说，“让帝国主义者知道我们正准备同黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克的阿拉伯弟兄们并肩作战，来击败帝国主义者。我们请求接受我们做为志愿军。”
    新华社新德里22日电  据印度报业托辣斯报道，黎巴嫩反对党领袖、前总理萨拉姆21日说，黎巴嫩民族阵线现在的主要目的是把美国军队全部从黎巴嫩赶出去。
    他指出，美国在黎巴嫩的军队是占领军。他说，他的部队到现在为止还没有攻击美国军队，“但是不久我们将同他们作战”。他说，“我们将用武力来对付武力”。
    萨拉姆说，在必要时，将另外成立政府来同美国占领军作战。由于面对着外国干涉，另外成立政府已经具有迫切的可能性。他还说，
  “我们将需要外界的援助以便在我们的土地上同外国军队作战”。
    他在谈到夏蒙政权企图在7月24日举行议会会议选举新总统的阴谋时指出，在外国军队没有赶出去以前，选举没有意义。
    据新华社22日讯  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩人民已经打落、打伤多架一再低飞寻衅的美国侵略军飞机。
    一名美国侵略军空军发言人今天承认，仅在贝鲁特地区就已经有十六架美军飞机被黎巴嫩起义部队开枪打中，其中有的受伤很重，不能起飞。在这以前，一架美国军用飞机19日在贝鲁特以东十英里的地方被黎巴嫩起义者击中，在山中坠毁。
    另一名美国侵略军发言人也透露说，从第六舰队的航空母舰上起飞的美军侦察机，在的黎波里附近被黎巴嫩起义部队射击过十六次。
    新华社开罗21日电  据中东通讯社记者自贝鲁特报道，黎巴嫩舒夫山区的起义部队司令琼卜拉特已经打电报给伊拉克最高权力委员会，祝贺伊拉克革命的胜利。
    琼卜拉特在贺电中说，伊拉克军队反对帝国主义和暴力统治的起义是阿拉伯人最高兴的事。贺电说，“看到你们，我们觉得更有信心来最后战胜帝国主义和它的代理人。”
    新华社22日讯  汉堡消息：黎巴嫩反对党社会进步党（前译社会主义进步党）领袖琼卜拉特对西德“图片报”的记者说，“我们不要一个依靠美国施舍的新总统”。他说，“如果要使这次（总统）选举有意义的话，美国人必须撤出”。
    “图片报”在21日发表了琼卜拉特的谈话。琼卜拉特还说，“我们不会再坐视很久，全世界将看到我们不要他们（美国侵略军队）留在这里。”他说，美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉“已经大大加强了我们的地位，因为由于这种干涉，新近又有几十万人拥护我们”。
    黎巴嫩的总统选举预定在7月24日举行。美国在派军队侵占黎巴嫩的同时，正在让国务院的策划阴谋老手墨菲在贝鲁特施展威胁利诱的手段，企图使反对派接受选举一个亲美的总统职位继承人来代替夏蒙的方案。
    据新华社22日讯  贝鲁特消息：侵略黎巴嫩的美国军队已经发现自己处于敌对他们的当地人民的包围中，就连黎巴嫩首都的儿童也在设法惩罚他们。
    美联社记者20日自贝鲁特发出的一条消息承认，侵略黎巴嫩的美国海军陆战队和伞兵部队日夜担心两件事情，即黎巴嫩起义部队的狙击手们对美国卫兵和飞机开枪以及“卖汽水的黎巴嫩小孩的捣乱”。
    这个美国记者报道，在一个黎巴嫩小孩送给美国哨兵的一篮可口可乐中有一个瓶子爆炸了，“瓶子里装满汽油并装有定时爆炸装置”。美国侵略军的一个陆军发言人在20日说，“我们的保安人员正被这些小家伙和他们的汽水弄得骚扰不堪。”另据报道说，有一名美国海军陆战队士兵在热野战口粮时发生了爆炸，炸去他的三个手指。“据信爆炸物可能是放在燃料中”。
    新华社开罗21日电  伊拉克共和国电台今天晚上广播来自安曼的消息说，约旦人民反对约旦现政权的示威游行已经扩及约旦首都安曼。早些时候的消息说，约旦各地、特别是约旦河西岸一带曾经举行了示威游行。
    这家电台又说，在约旦人民的斗争日益发展的情况下，约旦国王侯赛因已经请求英国占领军派遣坦克部队守卫安曼王宫和其他地方。（附图片）
