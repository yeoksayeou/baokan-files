She Was Originally a Dance Fanatic

Hu Lanying was truly astonished when she first heard that the leadership had decided to cultivate a "one-dragon" experimental field on her No. 65 machine. She had always believed: "Whoever falls behind will not be able to solve any problems and will always be behind." She simply couldn't have imagined that the leadership would now treat her as a key target for cultivation!

Hu Lanying is one of the famous "dance fanatics" in Zhenhuan Textile Factory. She is often so busy dancing that she only sleeps five or six hours a day. In her shift, she often delayed patrol and cleaning work because she wanted to dance and talk about dancing. Once, she even left the spinning spindles unattended and ran to the opposite aisle to put on lipstick with another young female worker, which was criticized by the workers' representative meeting as a typical example. As a result, her production naturally suffered. The return waste rate for general shift workers is around 0.7%, while hers is at least 0.8% or more.

However, despite her poor production, she had a different view. The No. 65 spinning frame has a nickname called "Tiger Machine." This means that when it breaks, it breaks row by row, and the yarn it produces is uneven, like bamboo knots; ... anyway, no one can deal with it, it is as fierce as a tiger. She had raised this issue many times, but the leadership had not resolved it. She believed that her own love of playing was a shortcoming, but if the machine had problems, no matter how good the work was, production could not improve! Every time the leadership criticized her, she would answer in her heart: "Ghosts, you only know how to talk, we are exhausted in production, and only end up being criticized."

Now, the leadership says that they want to cultivate a typical example of improving yarn quality on her "Tiger Machine," and cultivate a typical example of the backward catching up with the advanced. Can she catch up? She felt a little flustered in her heart and only said one sentence: "As long as you have the confidence to cultivate me, I have the confidence to catch up!"

The Story of the "Tiger Machine" Being Tamed

As soon as the decision was made, her other machine, No. 66, also started breaking yarn row by row. She was anxious when Workshop Director Sun turned over from another aisle. She immediately pointed to these spindles and shouted a few words in his ear, and he just nodded, flipped open the fleece roller to take a look, and checked the head of the machine. Without saying anything, he left.

Where did he go? She knew that this machine had to be repaired by the maintenance department, and the relationship between their spinning room and the maintenance department had been damaged. In the past, the machines were always difficult to work with for a few days after each repair, and these girls would curse in front of others: "Good-for-nothings!" Some even followed them out of the workshop cursing. The workshop also often had a bad relationship with the maintenance department because the quality plan could not be completed. Matters related to maintenance were often delayed. Would Director Sun delay the problem this time? Who knew that near the end of the shift, she saw him again leading the deputy foreman and the repairman to this machine, gesturing and discussing for a while. When she went to work the next day, the machine no longer broke yarn in rows.

The biggest change was still the No. 65 "Tiger Machine." From the day it was decided to make it a key machine, the manager and chief engineer, who were rarely seen in the past, came to participate in production labor. This machine became the object for them to understand the situation and study the problems. Deputy Director Dai of the workshop in charge of technology, Xiao the repairman from the repair team, and the engineers and technicians, spent all day around this machine, looking for the root cause of its problems, sometimes not stopping work until after 8 o'clock in the evening. They also gave her a piece of chalk and told her to draw a line next to the spindle every time she connected a broken end. At the end of the shift, the recorder circled the spindles with the most lines, and they would come to besiege this "tiger spindle." After doing this for nearly a month and repairing the machine six times, the tiger machine was tamed. The breakage rate decreased, and the yarn produced was more uniform and smooth.

The Problem Lies in Drive Plus Modesty

The leadership changed their working style and improved the equipment conditions, but her return waste did not decrease accordingly. Some people advocated: "Send a good hand to replace her." She was very unhappy when she heard this, but she also said: "You can send someone with good technique to work on this machine, I can't do it." The leadership did not agree with this view. They also told everyone about an incident: The workshop also cultivated typical machines last year, and all selected advanced producers to work on them, but after they had explored some operating experience, everyone said: "There are only a few good examples in the entire workshop of three or four hundred people, how can we learn from them?" They were unwilling to learn properly. The current problem is to have everyone support Hu Lanying and help Hu Lanying.

The leadership's opinion was correct. Hu Lanying was not without class consciousness and did not seek progress. She was the daughter of a worker, and had worked in the factory since she was a child, directly suffering from the exploitation of capitalists and the oppression of feudal foremen. She also closed the machines and went on strike with adult workers to improve living conditions. She also joined the Communist Youth League in 1952. It was just that she was young and loved to play (she is only twenty-one years old this year), and she usually did not care about politics, so she slowly became addicted to playing. The leadership talked about labor discipline, but she did not listen; they introduced advanced experience, but she did not learn. Last year, the great rectification movement began, and after a series of socialist education, she also had many new understandings. She re-watched the movie "Liu Hulan." Liu Hulan was even younger than her when she sacrificed herself, "People were so heroic in dealing with the enemy, why shouldn't I work hard in production?" She visited Wuhan State Cotton Mill No. 1 and saw that the labor model Wang Guiying in this factory was about the same age as her. People had created excellent achievements in production, why couldn't she? She also secretly worked harder, but perhaps because she had not been working hard for a long time, or perhaps because her operating methods were not correct, she felt tired after working for two days, and she could not see much achievement in production, so she became discouraged again.

At this time, the Communist Youth League branch pointed out two things to her: First, she must show revolutionary drive, first of all, improve labor discipline, and concentrate her energy on production; second, she must humbly learn from advanced experience and improve her own operations. She thought about it carefully, and the problem was right here. General shift workers go to work half an hour early every day to clean the spindle feet and the head of the machine, make various preparations, and drive smoothly, patrolling and connecting ends while doing cleaning work. She, however, arrived at the workshop five minutes before work, and started the machine as soon as she changed her clothes. She couldn't even manage to finish cleaning in the first two hours, and because she loved to chat idly during production, she couldn't even take care of patrolling and connecting ends. If the yarn breaks and is not connected immediately, how can the return waste rate not be high? In those few days when she secretly tried hard, she didn't know what key points to grasp in production, so she ended up being very busy and tired, but she didn't see any effect in production.

She Became a "Locomotive"

She began to go to work early to make various preparations, and concentrated her thoughts during production, without talking. The workshop first organized Du Xiaohua, who reduced return waste, to introduce her experience. She also listened carefully and learned carefully. She found that Du Xiaohua had many characteristics in implementing the "Cleaning Work Chart." For example, she stipulated that the "cotton suction nozzle" should be cleaned three times, but she cleaned it four or five times. She stipulated that the "machine surface" should be cleaned three times, but she cleaned it six times. She operated according to Du Xiaohua's experience, and the machine was much cleaner and the breakage was less. She also changed the patrol speed from once every seven or eight minutes to once every two or three minutes according to her own situation. Her return waste rate immediately gradually decreased, and finally caught up with the advanced level in the city.

At this time, someone posted a big-character poster: "There is a flower on the 'one-dragon,' the return waste ranks first, but the joints are as big as soybeans, how can you produce premium yarn?" Criticizing her jointing method as very old. The trade union organized the shift workers of the one-dragon to experiment with jointing methods, and she also got zero points. At this time, she learned the "automatic twisting jointing method" with the help of the coach. Wang Guiying, a labor model from Wuhan State Cotton Mill No. 1, came to their factory to perform operations, and she also watched her jointing movements with all her attention. She also practiced jointing after get off work every day, and asked people for advice if she had difficulties. Her jointing technology also rose to three points and four points.

In this way, her No. 65 machine produced the first piece of premium yarn (light inspection) in the city in February, and gradually rose to three pieces and four pieces. The workshop workers immediately posted big-character posters, saying that their one-dragon was a "golden dragon riding the clouds and fog," and requested that the experience of the No. 65 machine be promoted on their own machines. The workshop also immediately made a plan to overhaul all of the 63 machines spinning the same yarn count (32 counts) according to the overhaul experience of the No. 65 machine; on the other hand, they organized Hu Lanying to introduce her operating experience. Workers from other shifts also sent representatives to her machine to "study abroad," to "compare with Lanying, learn from Lanying, and whip the horses to catch up with Lanying." The 32-count yarn of the entire workshop also jumped from all failing to reach first-class first-grade in October last year, the quality eating eggs (zero points), to all first-class first-grade, and then to more than 80% being upper first-grade. Hu Mingxiu, a shift worker from Hankou Shenxin Yarn Factory, also reduced the return waste from 0.7% to about 0.5% after learning Hu Lanying's experience.

### 她冲上去了

    她冲上去了
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    她原是个舞迷
    胡兰英最初听说领导上决定在她的65号车上培育“一条龙”试验田，真是非常惊异。她一直认为：“谁要是落后了，就什么问题都不能解决，永远落后。”简直料想不到，领导上现时竟要把她当做重点来培养！
    胡兰英是震寰纱厂著名的“舞迷子”之一。她常常为跳舞忙得一天只睡五六个小时。她在班上也常常为想跳舞，谈跳舞，而耽误了巡回、清洁工作。有一次，她还丢开转得正欢的纱锭不管，跑到对面弄档去，跟另一个年轻女工一起照着镜子抹口红，被职工代表会当做典型批判了一番。这样，她的生产自然搞不好，一般值车工的回花率都在0.7％左右，而她最低也在0.8％以上。
    但是，生产虽不好，她却有不同的看法。65号细纱机有个混名儿叫“老虎车”。这是说它断起头来就一排一排地断，出的纱支粗细不匀，跟竹节一样；……反正，谁也对付不了它，就跟老虎一样凶狠。她为这事提了多少次意见，领导上也没有给解决。她认为，自己贪玩固然是个缺点，但机器有毛病，工作再好生产也好不起来！领导上每次批评她，她都在心里回答：“鬼啊，你们光会动嘴，我们在生产上累死了，只落得个批评。”
    现在，领导上却说要在她的“老虎车”上培养提高纱支质量的典型，培养落后赶先进的典型，她能赶上去吗？她心里有些发慌，只说了一句：“只要你们有信心培养，我就有信心赶上！”
    “老虎车”被驯服的故事
    事情刚决定，她的另一台66号车子也一排一排地断纱了。她正在着急，车间孙主任从别的弄档转过来了。她马上指着这些锭子，敞开嗓门在他耳边喊了几句，只见他点了点头，又翻开毛辊看了看，到车头上检查了一下，没说什么，便走了。
    他到哪里去了？她知道，这车子得找保全部门修理，而她们细纱间跟保全部门的关系弄坏了。过去每次检修后车子总有几天不好做，她们这些姑娘们就当着人家的面骂：“饭桶！”有的还跟着人家骂出车间去。车间也常为质量完不成计划，跟保全部门闹的挺不好。有关检修的事儿也就往往拖延下来。孙主任这次会不会把问题拖下来呢？谁知快下班时，又见他领着副工长和检修师傅来到这台车前，指手划脚地议论了一阵子。她第二天上班，车子就不再成排地断纱了。
    变化最大的还是65号“老虎车”。从决定它为重点机台那天起，过去很难见到的经理、总工程师都来参加生产劳动了，这台车就成为他们了解情况，研究问题的对象。车间管技术的戴副主任，检修组的萧师傅和工程师、技术员，更是成天在这台车前转，找它的毛病根子，有时到晚上八点多钟也不歇工。他们还给了她支粉笔，叫她接一次断头就在锭子边上画一道，下班时记录员把道儿最多的纱锭圈了起来，他们就来围攻这个“老虎锭子”。这样搞了将近一个月，把车子检修了六次，老虎车就被驯服了，断头率下降，出的纱支也均匀、光洁多了。
      问题在于干劲加虚心
    领导上改变了工作作风，也改善了设备条件，而她的回花却没有随着下降。有的人便主张：“派个好手去将她换下来。”她听了这话很不痛快，但嘴上也讲：“你们派个技术棒的来这车上做，我不行。”领导上不同意这种主张。他们还向大家讲了一件事：车间去年也培养过典型机台，一律选的先进生产者值车，但当她们摸索出一些操作经验后，大家却说：“全车间三四百号人就只这么几个好样儿的，我们怎么学得了她们？”不肯好好学习。目前的问题是要大家支持胡兰英，帮助胡兰英。
    领导上的意见是正确的。胡兰英并不是没有阶级觉悟和不求进步的。她是工人的女儿，从小就进厂做工，直接受过资本家的剥削和封建把头的压迫，也跟成年工人一起为改善生活条件关过车，罢过工。她还在1952年就加入了青年团。只是年轻贪玩（她今年才二十一岁），平常不关心政治，于是就慢慢地迷恋于玩乐了。领导上讲劳动纪律，她不听；介绍先进经验，她不学。去年伟大的整风运动开始了，在经过一系列的社会主义教育后，她也有许多新的认识。她重新看了“刘胡兰”的电影，刘胡兰牺牲时比她的年纪还小，“人家对付敌人是那么英勇，为什么自己在生产上不努力？”她去武汉国棉一厂参观，见这个工厂的劳动模范王桂英的年岁也跟她差不多，人家在生产上创造出了优异成绩，为什么自己就不行？她也暗中加过劲，努过力，也许是因为长期没有紧张劳动，也许是因为操作方法不对头，她干了两天就累得慌，而生产上也看不出多大成绩，便又泄气了。
    团支部这时给她指出了两点：一要拿出革命干劲，首先搞好劳动纪律，把精力集中在生产上；二要虚心学习先进经验，改进自己的操作。她仔细想了想，问题可不就在这里。一般值车工都是每天提前半小时上班，把锭脚、车头打扫得干干净净，做好各种准备，一开车就顺顺当当地一边巡回接头，一边搞清洁工作。她却是上班前五分钟才到车间，刚换好衣服就开车了。前两个小时光忙着打扫清洁也忙不过来，加上她还爱在生产中闲扯，就更顾不上巡回接头了。纱断了头不马上接好，回花怎么会不高？她暗中使劲那几天，又不知在生产中抓哪些重点，结果闹得自己很忙很累，却在生产上见不到效果。
  她成了“火车头”
    她开始提前上班做好各种准备，在生产中也集中思想，不说话。车间首先组织降低回花的杜肖花介绍经验，她也去仔细听，仔细学，发现杜肖花在贯彻“清洁工作图表”中有很多特点，例如规定“吸棉笛管”做三次清洁，她却做了四次、五次，规定“车面”做三次清洁，她却做了六次。她按照杜肖花的经验操作，车子就光堂多了，断头也少了。她又根据自己的情况，将巡回速度由七八分钟一次改为两三分钟一次。她的回花率马上就逐步下降，最后赶上了全市先进水平。
    这时，又有人贴大字报：“一条龙上有朵花，回花考第一，接头却有黄豆大，怎么能出优级纱？”批评她的接头方法很陈旧。工会组织一条龙的值车工们试验接头法，她也考了个零分。这时她就在教练员帮助下，学习“自动加捻接头法”。武汉国棉一厂的劳动模范王桂荣来她们工厂表演操作，她也全神贯注地看她接头的动作。她还每天下班后练习接头，有困难就向人请教。她的接头技术也就升到三分、四分了。
    这样，她的65号车便在2月份出了全市第一块优级纱（灯光检验），并逐步升到三块、四块。车间工人立即贴出大字报，说她们的一条龙是“腾云驾雾的金龙”，要求把65号车的经验在自己的机台上推广。车间也立即订出计划，一方面按照65号车的检修经验，将63号纺同样纱支（32支）的机台全部检修过；一方面组织胡兰英介绍她的操作经验。别班的工人还派代表到她车上来“留学”，要作到“比兰英、学兰英、快马加鞭赶兰英”。全车间的32支纱也就由去年10月全部达不到一等一级，质量吃了鸡蛋（零分），跃进到全部一等一级，再跃进到80％以上都是上等一级。汉口申新纱厂的值车工胡明秀来学习胡兰英的经验后，也使回花由0.7％降为0.5％左右。
