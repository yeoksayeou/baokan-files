Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: Albanian Ambassador to China, Comrade Dello Balili, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Ambassador Dello Balili spoke at the reception. He said, "Our army grew up in the struggle of the Albanian people against foreign invaders and domestic traitors. At the time of our country's liberation, the population was 1.2 million, but there were more than 70,000 guerrillas. We killed, wounded, and captured 68,000 enemies. Our army once went to Yugoslav territory to fight the enemy and assisted in the liberation of the fraternal Yugoslav people. However, even as hundreds of Albanian guerrillas were shedding blood for the liberation of Kosovo and Metohija, and even Serbia, the Yugoslav revisionist leaders were brewing various conspiracies against our country in order to turn Albania into a province of Yugoslavia."

Ambassador Dello Balili said, "Today, we are proud that our country is a member of the powerful socialist camp and a member of the Warsaw Pact."

He said that the soldiers and officers of our army have deep feelings for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Like the armies of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, they are now striving to modernize on the one hand, and actively participate in socialist economic and cultural construction on the other.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of our country, said at the reception that the Albanian People's Army has experienced a glorious combat path and demonstrated a heroic spirit of unyieldingness in the face of the powerful German and Italian fascists. Now, the Albanian People's Army is a faithful defender of the Albanian people's freedom, independence, and peaceful labor, and at the same time a strong force defending European and world peace together with the glorious Soviet Army and the armies of other socialist countries.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the people and armies of China and Albania are fighting together to defend socialist construction, strive for lasting peace, and oppose war. The fraternal friendship between us is unbreakable, and this friendship will surely continue to develop continuously in the future.

Among those invited to attend today's reception were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Senior General Hong Xuezhi, Admiral Wang Hongkun, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai of the Air Force, and other senior generals and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Ambassadors and military attachés of various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军十五周年
    阿驻华大使举行酒会
    新华社10日讯　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻中国大使德略·巴利里今晚举行酒会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军十五周年。
    德略·巴利里大使在酒会上讲话。他说，我们的军队是在阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗外国侵略者和本国卖国贼的斗争中成长起来的。我国解放时，人口有一百二十万，游击队员却有七万多。我们击毙、击伤和俘掳敌人达六万八千人。我们的军队曾经到南斯拉夫领土上去打击敌人，给予兄弟般的南斯拉夫人民的解放以援助。然而，正当成百的阿尔巴尼亚的游击队员，为了考索伏和梅托希亚以至塞尔维亚的解放而流血牺牲的时候，南斯拉夫修正主义领导者却为将阿尔巴尼亚变成南斯拉夫的一个省，在酝酿着种种反对我们国家的阴谋诡计。
    德略·巴利里大使说，今天，我国是强大的社会主义阵营的一员，同时是华沙条约成员国之一，这使我们感到骄傲。
    他说，我国军队中的士兵和军官与中国人民解放军有着深厚的感情。他们现在像苏联、中国以及所有社会主义国家的军队一样，一方面努力实现现代化，一方面也积极地参加社会主义的经济和文化建设。
    我国国防部长彭德怀元帅在酒会上讲话说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军经历了光荣的战斗道路，在德、意法西斯强敌面前表现了威武不屈的英雄气概。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是阿尔巴尼亚人民自由、独立和和平劳动的忠实保卫者，同时也是与光荣的苏军和社会主义阵营其他各国军队一起保卫欧洲和世界和平的坚强力量。
    彭德怀元帅说，中、阿两国人民和军队正在为保卫社会主义建设，争取持久和平和反对战争而共同奋斗。我们之间的兄弟友谊是牢不可破的，这一友谊今后必将继续不断地向前发展。
    应邀出席今天酒会的，有外交部副部长曾涌泉，洪学智上将、王宏坤海军上将、萧向荣中将、曹里怀空军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领和陆海空军军官。
    各国驻华大使和武官也应邀出席了酒会。
