Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 10th: Following the conclusion of grain crop planting, Yunnan Province has launched a massive, province-wide melon planting campaign. The action slogan of farmers of all ethnic groups is: "Every household plants a hundred patches of melon, not an inch of land left uncultivated." According to incomplete statistics from more than sixty counties, more than 210 million patches of pumpkins, bananas melons, and wheat melons have been planted in various places.

Now, "golden melon mountains" and "golden melon ridges" have appeared in many areas. Front and back of houses, courtyards, field edges, land edges, ditch edges, river edges, roadsides, and cemeteries are all planted with pumpkins. Many farmers let melon vines climb onto rooftops, stable roofs, and melon sheds.

Farmers in Yunnan have traditionally had the habit of growing melons and have accumulated rich cultivation experience. In the past, the average yield of melons in Yiliang County reached more than one hundred catties per plant. Last year, Yang Kaichang, a melon growing expert in Luquan County, grew 188 melons on one plant, the largest weighing more than 120 catties, for a total harvest of more than 1,300 catties. This year, all parts of the province have summarized and promoted local melon growing experience. Because melon crops do not take up cultivated land, are easy to cultivate, have a high survival rate, high yields, and a wide range of uses, farmers of all ethnic groups are happy to plant them.

    每户百塘瓜　不荒一寸土
    新华社昆明10日电　继粮食作物栽种结束之后，云南省又展开了声势浩大的全民种瓜运动。各族农民的行动口号是：“每户百塘瓜，不荒一寸土”。据六十多县的不完全统计，各地种下的南瓜、蕉瓜、麦瓜等已有两亿一千多万塘。
    现在，许多地区已出现了一座座的“金瓜山”和“金瓜岭”。屋前屋后、院心、田头、地边、沟边、河边、路边和坟地，也都种满了南瓜。许多农民让瓜蔓爬上了屋顶、厩顶和瓜棚。
    云南各地农民历来就有种瓜的习惯，并且积累了丰富的栽培经验。宜良县往年瓜的产量，平均每棵达一百多斤；禄劝县种瓜能手杨开昌去年种的一棵，结瓜一百八十八个，最大的一个重一百二十多斤，共收获一千三百多斤。今年，全省各地都总结推广了本地的种瓜经验。由于瓜类作物不占耕地面积，栽培简单，成活率高，产量高，用途广，各族农民都乐于栽种。
