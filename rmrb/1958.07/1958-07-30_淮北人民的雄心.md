The 12 million people of the Huaibei region in Anhui Province are engaged in a great plan to fundamentally transform the natural landscape. They aim to realize a network of rivers and canals across the vast plain of over 38,000 square kilometers. This will transform all farmland in Huaibei into paddy fields or irrigated land, and fundamentally solve transportation issues, thereby creating favorable conditions for a great leap forward in both agricultural and industrial production in Huaibei. The basic content of this ambitious plan is to further renovate the existing 15 larger rivers and open nine new river channels. This will allow the larger rivers of Huaibei to form the backbone of a river network. Between these major river networks, more than 2,600 large ditches (actually also river channels, 30 to 50 meters wide at the top and 6 meters deep), more than 15,000 medium ditches (20 meters wide at the top and 5 meters deep), and more than 110,000 small ditches (10 meters wide at the top and 4 meters deep) will be dug. Between these rivers, large, medium, and small ditches, small channels, ponds, and wells will be dug and enclosed according to different terrains. Springs will be utilized universally in rivers, ditches, ponds, and wells, achieving the simultaneous use of three types of water (i.e., rainwater, river water, and underground spring water). This will weave the entire Huaibei into a dense water network. To facilitate irrigation and transportation, thousands of culverts and bridges of varying sizes will be constructed and controlled between rivers, channels, ditches, and ponds. This will allow for the retention of large amounts of floodwater during heavy rains, preventing flooding even with 400 millimeters of rain in five days; and allow for water to be diverted for irrigation during dry spells, preventing drought for 70 days without rain. After the completion of these projects, the old and new rivers will be navigable by ships of 100 to 1,200 tons, the medium and large ditches will be navigable by wooden boats, so that every county can be reached by ships, every township by wooden boats, and every commune and village by small boats, greatly facilitating the increasingly heavy transportation needs. At the same time, the river network can also be used for power generation and aquaculture, achieving comprehensive management and utilization. If we were to summarize this river network in one sentence, it would be: "Turn Huaibei into Jiangnan," as proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

To realize a network of rivers and canals, to "turn Huaibei into Jiangnan"—this is the soaring ambition of the people of Huaibei. The greatness of this ambition can be seen from the original foundation. Jiangnan is a prosperous land of fish and rice, while Huaibei has suffered from water and drought disasters for more than 700 years. Before liberation, the people lived in poverty, unable to get enough to eat or wear. The agricultural yield per unit in Jiangnan is three to four times higher than in Huaibei due to the guarantee of water conservancy. To bring the agricultural production level of Huaibei to the same high level as Jiangnan is something that predecessors dared not imagine. Looking at the project itself, Jiangnan's water network has a history of more than 2,000 years. The Huai River has been repeatedly seized by the Yellow River since the Song Dynasty, leading to siltation of the riverbed, destruction of the water system, and uneven distribution of rainfall. Too much rain leads to flooding, and too little rain leads to drought, especially the problem of internal flooding, which is very difficult to solve. During the process of harnessing the Huai River, some people had envisioned opening a new Huai River from Zhoukoudian in Henan Province to Hongze Lake to solve the problem of internal flooding. But the current river network plan is not just about one river, but about digging nine new rivers and connecting all these newly dug rivers and ditches, with a total length of 125,000 kilometers. To achieve this goal, at least 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork must be excavated per square kilometer, and at least 10 billion cubic meters must be done in the entire Huaibei. How much time will it take to excavate such a huge project? The answer from the people of Huaibei is: two years. To completely change the natural landscape in such a short period of time and on such a large area, turning thousands of years of water disasters into water conservancy, is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. From a foreign perspective, the world-famous Panama Canal, which is more than 80 kilometers long, took 33 years to excavate; the Suez Canal, which is more than 170 kilometers long, took 10 years to excavate. Looking at China's largest water conservancy project, the river network of the Yangtze River Delta, which the people of Huaibei are trying to catch up with, began in the Wu Kingdom of the Spring and Autumn Period in the 5th century BC. It took more than 2,000 years and dozens of dynasties to gradually develop, repair, and become the scale it is today. China's Grand Canal, which runs through the north and south, began to be dug in the 6th century BC and was completed in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Here, we set aside the political, military, and economic purposes of the ruling class in the past when excavating these projects, and compare them only in terms of the size of the project and the time it took. It is difficult to compare them with the scale of today's Huaibei river network. This shows the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Once the masses of the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, master their own destiny, their creative power is endless.

To realize this river network plan, the people of Huaibei have been working hard for a winter and a spring since the second half of last year. They overcame various difficulties such as severe cold and snow, and the lack of technical personnel. With their own hands and wisdom, they completed nearly 4 billion cubic meters of earthwork, excavated 1,062 large ditches, 8,067 medium ditches, 90,690 small ditches, 58 large and medium culverts, and 8,279 small culverts, thereby greatly changing the face of Huaibei. Eighty-six townships and 582 agricultural cooperatives in Huaibei have basically realized the river network, eradicating water and drought disasters. These water conservancy projects have been tested for half a year and have proven their superior role in resisting natural disasters. When spring wheat was attacked by frost this spring, the disaster was avoided by using the water from the ditches and ponds for irrigation; later, when wheat rust occurred, the ditches played a drainage role, which greatly reduced the damage caused by wheat rust and ensured this year's unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat. In particular, this year's summer planting in Huaibei was carried out under drought conditions with no heavy rain for half a year. Thanks to the role of water conservancy projects, not only were more drought-resistant crops such as sweet potatoes planted than in previous years, but also more than 4 million mu of rice were replanted, which would have been impossible under the same drought conditions in previous years. As for the areas that have basically realized the river network, there is no problem of drought resistance at all. They not only completed the plan to replant rice and ensured timely sowing and irrigation, but also had surplus water to support neighboring areas.

The implementation of the river network plan is changing the thoughts and feelings of the people of Huaibei. Before they found the correct way to control water, they had a fear of water due to the long-term water disasters. But now it is different. "Water is the most precious wealth of mankind." The people of Huaibei have truly realized this in the process of realizing the river network. They are no longer afraid of water, but love and desire water. Today's Huaibei is crisscrossed by rivers and canals, and ponds and wells are scattered like chess pieces. Although there are no green mountains, there is already green water, and although there are no forests, there are rows of trees. The prototype of the river network has already taken shape. It would be wrong if someone were to imagine Huaibei with the old concepts. Agricultural production in Huaibei is developing by leaps and bounds, old farming habits are changing rapidly, and industrial production and cultural and health work are also advancing by leaps and bounds. The material and cultural life of the people is constantly improving, and the days of living on bran and vegetables for half a year have become history forever. They are no longer going to the cities to escape famine and seek a livelihood as they did in the past, but are producing a large amount of grain to supply the workers in the cities and working together to build socialism. The people of Huaibei are not satisfied with their existing achievements. After finding the correct direction for water control, they are even more encouraged to work hard. They are determined to work hard for another winter and a spring under the shining of the general line, basically realizing a comprehensive water network. With the experience of the great leap forward in water control last winter and this spring, coupled with early preparation, early action, and vigorous promotion of new tools to improve labor efficiency, the great ambition of the people of Huaibei to transform nature will surely be completely realized.

The people of Huaibei found the policy of realizing a river network to fundamentally control the Huai River after many twists and turns. There is no need to go back to very distant history here. During the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the people suffered countless hardships under the double pressure of man-made disasters and natural disasters. Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Huayuankou alone drowned 500,000 people in Henan and Anhui, and more people were constantly struggling between hunger and death. The so-called "Huai River diversion" was only a way for Kuomintang officials to increase their embezzlement and enrichment. In that era, even if some engineering technicians had envisioned controlling the Huai River, they would not have been able to do so correctly because they were influenced by bourgeois views and ignored the great power of the people. Not long after liberation, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well." Although the country was in the critical period of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, it still allocated a large amount of funds for Huai River control. Over the past eight years, the investment has reached 1.45 billion yuan. Anhui Province alone has invested 560 million yuan and has achieved many results. However, until last winter, some comrades did not understand Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's policy on Huai River control, especially the lack of a correct understanding of the socialist construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, which led to many detours in Huai River control. There are two ideologies engaged in a struggle here, namely, relying mainly on the masses or relying mainly on the government? Focusing mainly on small-scale projects or focusing mainly on large-scale projects? Focusing mainly on water storage or focusing mainly on drainage? This is a struggle between two policies and two lines. This struggle took place in various forms for eight years, and only achieved a basic victory last winter. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the socialist construction line of more, faster, better, and more economical results instructed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, studied the experience and lessons of eight years of Huai River control, found the basic laws of fundamentally controlling internal flooding in the Huai River, and resolutely implemented the policy of "three main" and "three combination": mainly relying on the masses to run the project themselves, with government support; mainly focusing on small-scale projects, with large-scale projects supporting them; mainly focusing on water storage, with more storage and less drainage; combining flood control and waterlogging control; combining water control and replanting; combining politics and professional work. Under the guidance of this policy, ten regulations for river network were formulated. The goal is to turn Huaibei into Jiangnan. Because of adhering to this correct Huai River control policy and overcoming the opposite erroneous policy, the Huai River control has entered a new stage. The past detours have been straightened, and the people of Huaibei have fully exerted their great potential under the encouragement of slogans such as "Turn Huaibei into Jiangnan" and "Control the Huai River well and eat rice." They worked hard and completed 4 billion cubic meters of earthwork in half a year. Except for a very small number of highly technical large-scale projects, all earthwork projects, including rivers, ditches, ponds, culverts, and bridges, were all funded by the masses themselves, designed themselves, and created miracles with their own hands and wisdom, brilliantly realizing the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Practice has proven that this river network Huai River control policy is completely correct. This policy provides a correct direction for water conservancy projects in the plains. In recent years, wherever the Party Central Committee's "three main" policy has been resolutely implemented, great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction. The specific implementation of the "three main" policy varies according to specific circumstances. We have already summarized the experience of transforming low-lying land in Tianjin, and also summarized the experience of controlling the Mang River in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province. Later, we summarized the control of the Shaying River and the experience of water control in mountainous areas. However, we have not yet found a relatively complete experience in solving water conservancy in the plains. We now have the experience of Huaibei river network water control. The facts have proven that river network is the correct direction for solving water conservancy problems in the plains. The significance of this good experience created by the people of Huaibei in the course of practice will far exceed the Huaibei area.

The people of Huaibei have long suffered from the dual disasters of the exploiting classes and natural disasters, living in poverty, cultural backwardness, and low production levels. Precisely because of this, the people of Huaibei have a stronger desire to change the status quo. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire to act, the desire to make revolution." The people of Huaibei originally had a glorious revolutionary tradition. In the past nearly 30 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have made many outstanding contributions to the revolution. After liberation, the people of Huaibei showed even more soaring revolutionary enthusiasm. They have never bowed their heads in the fight against natural disasters. The agricultural cooperatives have developed and consolidated in the struggle to unite and overcome natural disasters. In socialist construction, they have shown their skills and exemplarily implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. They are not only full of enthusiasm on the agricultural and water conservancy fronts, but also full of enthusiasm on the industrial and cultural fronts. The face of Huaibei is changing rapidly. They are already in a historic leap and transformation. They will not only catch up with Jiangnan, but also surpass Jiangnan. The disaster-stricken, poverty-stricken, and backward Huaibei will be gone forever. A brand-new, industrialized, and modernized Huaibei with a high level of culture will soon appear on the plains of the motherland.

    淮北人民的雄心
    安徽淮北地区一千二百万人民，正在从事着一项从根本上改造自然面貌的伟大计划，就是要在三万八千多平方公里的辽阔平原上实现河网化，使淮北全部农田变成水稻田或水浇地，并使交通运输问题得到根本解决，从而为淮北农业生产大跃进和工业生产大跃进创造良好条件。这个宏伟计划的基本内容，就是进一步整修原有十五条较大河道，新开九条新河道，使淮北各较大的河流结成河网的骨干，在这些大的河网之间再开挖二千六百多条大沟（实际上也是河道，顶宽三十到五十公尺，深六公尺），一万五千多条中沟（顶宽二十公尺，深五公尺），十一万多条小沟（顶宽十公尺，深四公尺）。在这些河道、大中小沟之间，还根据不同地形，开挖小的渠道和塘、井，并圈圩，河沟塘井普遍下泉，达到三水齐用（即天上雨水、河中存水、地下泉水）。这样就把整个淮北织成稠密的水网。为了便于灌溉和交通，在河渠沟塘间将建设大大小小成千上万的涵闸、桥梁，加以控制，大雨则可以拦蓄大量洪水，五天内下雨四百公厘不涝；不雨则可以引水灌溉，七十天不雨不旱。这些工程建成以后，新旧河道可以通行一百吨到一千二百吨的轮船，大中沟通木船，这样就可以县县通轮船、乡乡通木船、社社村村通小船，大大便利于日益繁重的交通运输。同时，利用河网还可以发电，发展水产，达到全面治理，综合利用。假如要用一句话来概括这个河网化的图景，就是中共安徽省委所提出的“把淮北变成江南”。
    实现河网化，“把淮北变成江南”这就是淮北人民的勃勃雄心。这个雄心之所以伟大，是从原有的基础看。江南是富庶的鱼米之乡，而淮北历经七百多年的水旱灾害，人民在解放以前，长期处在食不果腹，衣不蔽体的贫困状态下。江南的农业单位产量因有水利保证，比淮北高出三四倍以上。现在要把淮北的农业生产水平也达到江南那样高，是前人所不敢设想的。再从工程来看，江南的水网已有两千多年的历史，淮河从宋代以来屡为黄河所夺，河床淤积，水系破坏，雨量分布不均，多下一点雨则涝，少下一点雨则旱，特别是内涝问题很不容易解决。在治淮过程中，曾经有人设想过从河南周口店开一条新淮河通到洪泽湖，来解决内涝问题，但现在的河网化，已不是一条河的问题，而是要开挖九条新河，把这些新开挖的河道和沟渠全部联结起来，总长度达十二万五千公里。为了达到这个要求，每平方公里所开挖的土方至少在二十五万公方以上，全淮北至少要做一百亿公方。开挖这样浩大的工程需要多少时间呢？淮北人民的回答是：两年。在这样短的时间内，在这样大的面积上彻底改变自然面貌，变千年水害为水利，这是古今中外没有先例的。从外国来看，名震全球的巴拿马运河全长八十多公里，前后开挖了三十三年；苏伊士运河全长一百七十多公里，开挖了十年。从我国最大的水利工程来看，淮北人民所要追赶的江南三角洲的河网，是从纪元前五世纪春秋时代的吴国开始的，历经两千多年、几十个朝代才逐渐开拓修补而成为今天的规模。我国贯通南北的大运河是从纪元前六世纪开始挖凿，到元、明两代才完成。这里我们撇开过去统治阶级开挖这些工程的政治、军事和经济目的不谈，即以工程本身大小、时间来比较，都是难与今天淮北河网化规模比拟的。这就说明社会主义制度之无比优越性，人民群众在共产党领导下，一旦掌握了自己的命运，创造力量是无穷无尽的。
    为了实现这个河网化计划，淮北人民从去年下半年起，已经大干一冬一春。他们克服严寒冰雪和技术力量不足的种种困难，以自己的双手和智慧，完成近四十亿土方，开挖了大沟一千零六十二条，中沟八千零六十七条，小沟九万零六百九十条，大中涵闸五十八座，小型涵闸八千二百七十九座，从而大大改变了淮北面貌。全淮北已有八十六个乡，五百八十二个农业社基本上实现了河网化，根除了水旱灾害。这些水利工程经过半年来的考验，已经证明它们在抵抗自然灾害中的优越作用，当今春小麦受到霜冻袭击时，由于利用沟塘的水进行浇灌，没有造成灾害；后来当小麦发生锈病时，又由于沟洫起了便于排水作用，从而大大减轻了锈病的危害程度，保证了今年小麦的空前丰收。特别是今年淮北夏种是在半年来未下透雨的干旱情况下进行的，由于水利工程的作用，不但山芋等旱作物种得比往年多，而且改种了四百多万亩水稻，这在往年同样旱情下是不可能的。至于已经基本上实现河网化的地方，根本不发生抗旱的问题，他们不但完成了改种水稻的计划、保证了及时播种及时灌溉，且有余水支援友邻地区。
    河网化计划的实施改变着淮北人民的思想感情，在他们没有找到正确的治水道路之前，因为长期水灾为害，形成怕水的心理，但是现在不同了，“水是人类最可宝贵的财富”，淮北人民在实现河网化的过程中才真正体会到这一点。他们现在不是怕水，而是爱水、想水了。现在的淮北，已经是河渠纵横，塘井棋布，虽无青山，已有绿水盈盈，虽无森林，已有树木成行，河网化的雏形已经初具。假如有人再用旧的概念来想像淮北，那就错误了。淮北的农业生产在飞跃发展着，旧的耕作习惯在迅速改变着，工业生产和文化、卫生工作也在飞跃前进着，人民物质生活和文化生活在不断地改善着，糠菜半年粮的日子已经永远成为历史。他们现在已不像过去那样到城市去逃荒谋求生计，而要生产出大量粮食供应城市的工人兄弟，携手进行社会主义建设。淮北人民不满足已有的成绩，他们有了治水的正确方向以后，更加鼓舞了干劲，他们决心在总路线的光辉照耀下，以更多的劳动热情，再大干一冬一春，基本上实现全面水网化。有了去冬今春治水大跃进的经验，加上今年早准备、早动手，并大力推广新式工具，提高劳动效率，淮北人民这一改造大自然的伟大雄心，是一定可以彻底实现的。
    淮北人民找到河网化这条根治淮河的方针是经过许多曲折的。这里用不着回溯很远的历史，在蒋介石反动统治时期，人民在人祸天灾的交迫下，不知受到多少苦难，仅蒋介石在花园口掘口就淹死河南、安徽五十万人民，更多的人民则长期辗转于饥饿和死亡线上。所谓“导淮”只不过是替国民党官员们增加一个贪污私饱的门路而已。在那种时代，即使有些工程技术人员设想过要治理淮河，也因为他们受了资产阶级观点的影响，把人民的伟大力量抛诸视野之外，因而他们所采取的方法也不可能是正确的。解放后不久，毛主席即发出“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召，国家为了治淮，虽在抗美援朝的紧要时期，仍然拨出大量经费。八年以来，投资达十四亿五千万元。仅安徽地区即投资五亿六千万元，取得了不少成绩。然而直到去冬以前，由于某些同志对毛主席、党中央治淮方针理解不够，特别是对多快好省的社会主义建设方针缺乏正确理解，以致使治淮走了许多弯路。这里有两种思想在进行着斗争，即是以依靠群众为主，还是依靠政府为主？以小型为主还是以大型为主？以蓄水为主还是泄水为主？这是两个方针，两条路线的斗争，这个斗争以各种形式进行了八年，到去冬才取得了基本的胜利。中共安徽省委根据毛主席、党中央所指示的多快好省的社会主义建设路线，研究了治淮八年的经验教训，找出了根治淮河内涝的基本规律，坚决地推行了以群众自办为主，政府支持；以小型为主，大型支持；以蓄水为主，多蓄少排；防洪与治涝相结合；治水与改种相结合；政治和业务相结合的“三主”、“三结合”的方针，并在这个方针的指导下，制定了河网化的十项规定，其奋斗目标，就是把淮北变成江南。由于坚持了这个正确的治淮方针，克服了与此相反的错误方针，就使治理淮河进入了一个新的阶段，过去的弯路被拉直了，淮北人民在“把淮北变成江南”、“治好淮河吃大米”等口号的鼓舞下，充分发挥了巨大的潜力。他们艰苦奋斗，大干半年，完成了四十亿土方，除极少数技术性高的大型工程外，所有土方工程，包括河道沟塘涵闸桥梁在内，全部都是群众自己拿钱，自己设计，用自己的双手和智慧，创造了奇迹，光辉地实现了多快好省的要求。实践已经证明，这条河网化的治淮方针是完全正确的。这个方针为平原地区的水利工程提供了一个正确的方向。几年来，凡是坚决贯彻了党中央“三主”方针的地方，水利建设都取得了巨大成就。“三主”方针的具体贯彻，随具体情况不同而各有各的做法。我们已经总结了天津改造洼地的经验，也总结了河南新乡专区治理漭河的经验，后来又总结了沙颍河的治理以及山区的治水经验，然而还没有找到一条比较完备的解决平原水利的经验，我们现在有了淮北河网化的治水经验，事实已经证明河网化是在平原地区解决水利问题的正确方向。淮北人民在实践过程中所创造的这条良好的经验，其意义将远远地超出于淮北地区之外。
    淮北人民长期以来遭受着剥削阶级和自然灾害的双重灾难，生活穷困，文化落后，生产水平低下，正因为如此，淮北人民要求改变现状的要求也更为强烈。正如毛主席所论断的：“穷则思变，要干，要革命”。淮北人民原来就有革命的光荣传统，近三十多年来，在中国共产党领导下对革命作出过许多杰出的贡献。解放以后，淮北人民更显出了冲天的革命干劲，在战胜自然灾害中，他们从来没有低过头。农业社是在团结起来战胜自然灾害的斗争中发展巩固起来的。在社会主义建设中，他们大显身手，模范地执行多快好省的方针，他们不仅在农业战线水利战线上干劲十足，在工业战线、文化战线上也干劲十足。淮北的面貌正迅速改变着，他们已处在一个历史性飞跃变革的过程中，他们不仅要赶上江南，而且要赶过江南。多灾多难贫穷落后的淮北将要一去不复返了，崭新的工业化的和农业现代化的有高度文化水平的淮北，不久就要出现在祖国的平原上。
