Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 2nd. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a statement to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson on July 1st, protesting the slanderous remarks made by U.S. Attorney General Rogers regarding the Soviet Union and Soviet foreign policy.

On June 21st, U.S. Attorney General Rogers delivered a public speech in Chicago, making a series of crude and slanderous attacks against the Soviet Union and Soviet foreign policy. He even insisted that the Soviet Union "launched a large-scale aggression" and wanted to "eliminate" the United States. Unable to find a basis for these absurd remarks, the U.S. Attorney General resorted to the verdicts of the Hungarian court against Nagy and a group of ringleaders of counter-revolutionary armed riots as his excuse.

The statement said that the U.S. Attorney General should know that the verdicts of the national courts of any country against its own citizens who have committed crimes against the country are entirely the internal affairs of that country. Is it because Rogers himself believes that it is justifiable to act as a defender for the blood-debt-ridden criminals sentenced by the Hungarian court, that he is attempting to shift the blame for interfering in the activities of the Hungarian judicial organs onto the Soviet Union?

The statement said that everyone knows that neither the U.S. Attorney General nor other U.S. officials have expressed any protest against the crimes committed by the recently convicted Hungarian conspirators. They did not protest when the rebels committed heinous atrocities on the streets of Budapest and other cities in Hungary, when large numbers of people were mutilated, and when Hungarian working people were hanged simply because they did not want to restore the fascist system in the country. At that time, Washington applauded the counter-revolutionary atrocities and even published publications featuring pictures of people who were shot, hanged, and mutilated.

"May we ask: Where was the humanity of those who are now weeping for the culprits of the Hungarian treasonous conspiracy when the rebels were committing crimes against the Hungarian people?"

"Currently, in Algeria, Cyprus, Oman, and elsewhere, many patriots who defend the independence of their homelands are sacrificed every day, and this has not aroused Mr. Rogers' protest. These patriots are shot by soldiers wielding American weapons and bombed by bombs dropped from American-made aircraft."

"Only those who aspire to play the role of an international gendarme with the mission of suppressing the growing progressive movements would utter remarks like those made by the U.S. Attorney General."

The statement also said that from the speech made by the U.S. Attorney General, it appears that the achievements of the People's Democratic Republic of Hungary are making certain "leaders of Western countries who still fantasize about restoring the decadent system that has been abandoned by the people in Eastern European countries feel uneasy."

Gromyko's statement said that the purpose of Rogers' speech was to undermine the basic trust necessary for maintaining normal relations between countries. This speech only serves the interests of those who base their entire policy on maintaining international tension and intensifying the "cold war."

### 美国司法部长诽谤苏联和平外交政策  葛罗米柯向美国提出严正抗议

    美国司法部长诽谤苏联和平外交政策
    葛罗米柯向美国提出严正抗议
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯1日把一份声明交给美国驻苏联大使汤普逊，抗议美国司法部长罗杰斯就苏联和苏联外交政策发表的诽谤言论。
    美国司法部长罗杰斯6月21日在芝加哥发表公开演说，对苏联和苏联的外交政策进行了一系列粗暴的、诽谤性的攻击。他甚至硬说苏联“发动规模庞大的侵略”，而且要“消灭”美国。这位美国司法部长由于无法给这些荒谬的言论找出根据，就只好把匈牙利法院判决纳吉等一批反革命武装暴乱头子作为他的借口。
    声明说，美国司法部长应当知道，任何一国的国家法院判决犯有反对本国的罪行的本国公民，完全是这个国家的内政。罗杰斯是不是因为他本人认为给那些被匈牙利法庭判刑的血债累累的罪犯当辩护人是无可厚非的，因而企图把干涉匈牙利司法机关的活动嫁祸于苏联呢。
    声明说，大家知道，无论是美国司法部长或是美国的其他官方人士，都没有对最近被判罪的匈牙利阴谋分子所犯下的罪行表示过任何抗议。当叛乱者在布达佩斯和匈牙利其他城市的街道上作出了骇人听闻的暴行、大批的人受到残害、匈牙利劳动人民仅仅由于不愿意在国内恢复法西斯制度而被绞死的时候，他们并没有提出抗议。在那个时候，华盛顿却为反革命的暴行喝采，并且专门出版了刊物，登载被枪杀、被绞死和被残害的人的图片。
    “请问：在叛乱者对匈牙利人民犯罪的时候，那些今天为匈牙利叛国阴谋的罪魁痛哭流涕的人的人道感到哪里去了呢？”
    “目前在阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、阿曼和其他地方，每天都有许许多多的捍卫自己祖国独立的爱国者牺牲，而这也并未引起罗杰斯先生的抗议。这些爱国者是被手持美国武器的士兵枪杀、被那些从美国造的飞机上扔下的炸弹炸死的。”
    “只有那些觊觎充当以镇压日益发展的进步运动为使命的国际宪兵角色的人，才会发出像美国司法部长所发表的这类言论。”
    声明还说，从美国司法部长发表的这篇谈话看来，人民民主的匈牙利的成就正使得某些“仍然幻想在东欧各国恢复已被人民唾弃的腐朽制度的西方国家领导人感到坐卧不安”。
    葛罗米柯的声明说，罗杰斯这篇演说的目的，是要破坏国与国之间维持正常关系所必需的起码的信任。这篇演说只符合那些把维持国际紧张局势和加剧“冷战”作为自己整个政策的基础的利益的人。
