    The First Universal Heavy Machine Tool Plant
    Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Starts Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 22nd: China's first universal heavy machine tool plant – the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant – has been basically completed one and a half years ahead of schedule and has comprehensively started production.
    In the plant's first and second machining workshops, workers are operating powerful, giant-like large machine tools, manufacturing heavy machine tool equipment that China has never been able to produce. They will produce 200 heavy machine tools of twelve specifications this year to equip China's heavy machinery manufacturing industry.
    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is enormous in scale and fully equipped. It was built with the help of the Soviet Union. Its smallest products weigh dozens of tons, and the larger ones weigh hundreds of tons and are as high as two or three stories. They can cut and process machine parts weighing dozens of tons. The plant has many types and quantities of products and can produce dozens of specifications of heavy machine tools every year. This year, the plant will manufacture hundreds of heavy machine tools for construction and production units across the country, and also produce hundreds of small machine tools. The plant officially started construction in April 1956. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 1959 and fully put into production in early 1960. However, in order to meet the needs of national construction, under the leadership of the Party committee, the plant implemented the general line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results, criticized conservative thinking, and adopted the method of building while producing, greatly advancing the time for full production. At the same time, by organizing production utilizing all possible conditions during construction, technical forces were trained and cultivated. They call this approach a shift from "guerrilla warfare" to a "regular army" approach.

    第一座万能性重型机床厂
    武汉重型机床厂开始生产
    据新华社武汉22日电  我国第一座万能性的重型机床厂——武汉重型机床厂已提前一年半基本建成，并且全面开始生产。
    在这个厂的第一、第二加工车间里，工人们正在操作着威力强大的、像巨人似的大机床，制造我国从来不能生产的重型机床设备。他们要在今年内生产出十二种规格的重型机床二百台，用来装备我国的重型机械制造业。
    武汉重型机床厂规模巨大，设备齐全，它是苏联帮助我国建设的。它最小的产品都有几十吨重，大的有几百吨重，有两三层楼那样高，能切削加工几十吨重的机器零件；它的产品种类和数量很多，每年能生产几十种规格的重型机床。今年，这个厂将为各地建设和生产单位制造几百台重型机床，同时附带生产几百台小型机床。这个厂是1956年4月正式开始建设的。原决定1959年底建成，1960年初全面投入生产。但是为了适应国家建设需要，在党委领导之下，这个厂贯彻了多快好省的方针，批判了保守思想，并且采取边建设、边生产的办法，使全面投入生产的时间大大提前。同时，由于在建设中利用一切可能利用的条件组织生产，从而锻炼培养了技术力量。他们把这种做法称为从“游击队”到“正规军”的做法。
