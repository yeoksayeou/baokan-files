Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The 52-year-old female Communist Party member He Yingdi, the first production team leader of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in the Hongshan Township of Fuzhou suburbs, along with a group of proactive cooperative members and Party and Youth League cadres, cultivated a test field of 1.399 mu of early rice. After separate harvesting, threshing, sun-drying, and weighing, the total yield was 4108 jin and 3 liang of dried grain, averaging 2936 jin and 8 liang per mu.

This spring, when He Yingdi led the production team members to discuss creating a high-yield record of 2700 jin per mu for the whole year on this plot of land (more than 1.4 times higher than the annual yield of 1111 jin per mu in 1957), she was opposed by a group of conservative cooperative members including the well-to-do middle peasant Chen Qiuguan. She was determined to harvest 2800 jin in the early rice season alone to achieve the annual high-yield plan. From plowing the field and transplanting seedlings to field management, He Yingdi and others worked hard and diligently studied methods.

This plot of land was plowed to a depth of seven inches (two to three inches deeper than ordinary fields), and more than 2650 dan of native miscellaneous fertilizer, cow dung, and green manure were applied successively. The superior Nan Te variety was used for single-plant propagation, with nearly 60,000 seedlings densely planted per mu. Usually, great attention was also paid to strengthening field management, resulting in thick stalks and large ears.

The cooperative members who originally doubted the possibility of high yields all participated in the harvesting and weighing. They were both surprised and delighted. They were surprised because they had never seen a mu of land yield so much rice, and delighted because the experimental field set an example for them and opened their minds.

    黎明社早稻亩产2935斤
    据新华社讯　福州市郊洪山乡黎明农业社五十二岁的女共产党员、第一生产队长何英俤等带领一批促进派社员和党、团干部，共同种植的一亩三分九厘九的早稻试验田，经过单收、单打、单晒、单秤，共收干谷四千一百零八斤三两，平均亩产二千九百三十六斤八两。
    今年春季，何英俤领导生产队员讨论要在这丘田上创造全年亩产二千七百斤（比1957年全年亩产一千一百一十一斤高一点四倍多）的水稻高额丰产纪录时，遭到富裕中农陈秋官等一批保守派社员的反对，决心创造早稻一季就收获二千八百斤，实现全年丰产计划。从犁田、插秧到田间管理，何英俤等人一直苦干、苦钻。
    这丘田犁深七寸，（比普通田多二寸到三寸），先后施下土杂肥、牛粪和绿肥等二千六百五十多担，采用单本繁殖的南特号良种，每亩密插秧苗近六万丛，平时也十分注意加强田间管理，因此秸粗穗大。
    原来怀疑能有高额丰产的社员都参加了收割和过秤，他们又惊又喜，吃惊的是从未见过一亩田能收这样多的稻谷，喜的是试验田给他们作出了榜样，打开了老脑筋。
