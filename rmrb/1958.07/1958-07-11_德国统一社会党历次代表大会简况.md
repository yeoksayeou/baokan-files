The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was held in Berlin from July 10 to 16.

The vanguard of the German working class, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, was formed on April 21, 1946, through the merger of the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany in eastern Germany, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

The German workers' movement had been mired in a long-term split, which severely weakened the strength of the German working class. However, during the arduous years of fighting against Hitler's war and in the democratic reforms after the liberation of eastern Germany, the Communist Party of Germany and the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of Germany fought together and developed cooperation. After the war, the situation in Germany bestowed upon the German working class and its parties the historical task of thoroughly eradicating the remnants of fascism, transforming and building Germany, and striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany. To achieve this historical task, the German working class and its parties had to first unite ideologically and organizationally. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany was founded under these circumstances.

From April 19 to 20, 1946, the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Germany and the Fortieth Congress of the Social Democratic Party of Germany were held in Berlin, at which resolutions were passed to convene a joint congress of the two parties.

The First (Founding) Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was convened from April 21 to 22, 1946. The congress unanimously adopted the resolution to reorganize the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party into the Socialist Unity Party. The founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was a turning point in the history of the German workers' movement and the history of the German people, and a victory for Marxism-Leninism in the German workers' movement.

In West Germany, due to the sabotage of the American, British, and French occupying forces and the West German reactionary forces, including the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the union of Communists and Social Democrats in West Germany could not be realized.

The congress adopted the programmatic document, "The Main Principles and Goals of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." The three basic tasks put forward by the congress to the party were: to fight for the unity of the workers' movement, to fight for the reunification of Germany, and to fight for the democratization of the entire political and economic life of the country. The congress pointed out that the goal of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany was to build socialism, and emphatically criticized the so-called "theory of a special German road to socialism." The congress approved the party constitution, adopted a letter to the German people, and elected the party's Central Leadership. Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl were elected as chairmen of the Central Leadership.

The Second Congress was held from September 20 to 24, 1947. This congress was conducted under these slogans: "Consolidate the ranks of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany," "Consolidate the unity of the working class with all democratic forces in Germany," "Strive for the democracy and unity of the country," "Oppose the threat to German national unity from American and British imperialists and German reactionaries." The congress determined that the party's general line was: to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty and the restoration of German unity, and to strengthen the state power in eastern Germany and carry out the construction of a socialist foundation. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, East Germany formulated and adopted a two-year plan (1949-1950) to restore and develop the peaceful economy of the Soviet occupation zone.

The Third Congress was held from July 20 to 24, 1950. The congress adopted the "Resolution on the Current Situation and the Tasks of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany." The main tasks put forward in the resolution were: to strive for peace, oppose the instigators of a new war, oppose the policy of restoring West German militarism, fight for the unification of the country and the consolidation of the National Front of Democratic Germany, and fight to transform the Socialist Unity Party of Germany into a fighting new type of Marxist-Leninist party. In its resolution on the Five-Year Plan for 1951-1955, the congress pointed out the prospects for the economic development of Germany.

The Fourth Congress was held from March 30 to April 6, 1954. The programmatic document adopted by the congress, "The Path to Solving the Vital Problems of the German Nation," pointed out that workers participating in various party organizations should unite to oppose the militarist group formed under the leadership of the ruling parties of the West German bourgeoisie. Therefore, establishing the united action of the working class is the most pressing task in West Germany today. The congress declared that striving for a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany is the unshakable goal of the program and struggle. The congress decided on measures to further develop the economy of the German Democratic Republic and instructed the new Central Committee to formulate the outline of the Second Five-Year Plan. The congress also adopted a new party constitution.

    德国统一社会党历次代表大会简况
    7月10日至16日，德国统一社会党在柏林举行第五次代表大会。
    德国工人阶级的先锋队——德国统一社会党是在1946年4月21日，由在德国东部的德国共产党和德国社会民主党，根据马克思列宁主义的原则合并组成的。
    德国工人运动曾经陷于长期的分裂，这使德国工人阶级的力量受到严重的削弱。但是，在反对希特勒战争的艰苦岁月中和在德国东部解放以后的民主改革中，德国共产党和德国社会民主党的左翼共同进行了斗争，发展了合作。战后，德国的形势赋予德国工人阶级及其政党以彻底肃清法西斯主义残余，改造和建设德国，争取德国的和平统一的历史任务。为了实现这个历史任务，德国工人阶级及其政党必须首先在思想上和组织上统一起来。德国统一社会党就是在这样的情况下成立的。
    1946年4月19日至20日，在柏林举行了德国共产党第十五次代表大会和德国社会民主党第四十次代表大会，会上都通过了召开两党联合代表大会的决议。
    德国统一社会党第一次（成立）代表大会在1946年4月21日至22日召开了。大会一致通过了改组德国共产党和社会民主党为统一社会党的决议。德国统一社会党的成立是德国工人运动史和德国人民历史中的一个转折点，是马克思列宁主义在德国工人运动中的胜利。
    在西德，由于美英法占领者和包括社会民主党右翼领袖在内的西德反动势力的破坏，共产党员和社会民主党员在西德的联合没有能够实现。
    代表大会通过了纲领性的文件——“德国统一社会党的主要原则和目标”。大会向党提出的三项基本任务是：为争取工人运动的统一而斗争，为争取德国的统一而斗争，为争取国家全部政治生活和经济生活的民主化而斗争。大会指出，德国统一社会党的目标是建设社会主义，并着重批判了所谓“从特殊的德国道路走向社会主义的理论”。大会批准了党章，通过了告德国人民书，选举了党的中央指导部。威廉·皮克和奥托·格罗提渥当选为中央指导部主席。
    第二次代表大会在1947年9月20日至24日召开。这次大会是在这些口号下进行的：“巩固德国统一社会党的队伍”、“巩固工人阶级与德国一切民主力量的团结”、“争取国家的民主与统一”、“反对美、英帝国主义者和德国反动派对德国民族统一的威胁”。大会确定了党的总路线是：争取缔结和约和恢复德国统一以及在德国东部加强国家力量，进行社会主义基础的建设。在德国统一社会党的领导下，东德制定和通过了恢复与发展苏占区和平经济的两年计划（1949—1950年）。
    第三次代表大会是1950年7月20日至24日召开的。大会通过了“关于目前形势和德国统一社会党的任务”的决议。决议提出的主要任务是：争取和平，反对新战争的挑拨者，反对恢复西德军国主义的政策，为国家的统一和民主德国全国阵线的巩固而斗争，为把德国统一社会党变为战斗的马克思列宁主义的新型政党而斗争。代表大会在它通过的关于1951年至1955年五年计划的决议中，指出了德国经济发展的前途。
    第四次代表大会在1954年3月30日至4月6日召开。在大会通过的纲领性文件“解决德意志民族的切身问题的道路”中指出，参加各党派组织的工人应该联合起来，反对西德资产阶级各执政党领导下组成的军国主义集团，因此，建立工人阶级的统一行动是西德当前最迫切的任务。大会宣布争取一个统一、和平、民主及独立的德国是纲领和斗争的不可动摇的目标。大会决定了进一步发展德意志民主共和国经济的措施，并责成新的中央委员会制订第二个五年计划的纲要。大会还通过了新党章。
