Remembering a Trip to Jordan
    Liu Dongsheng

    In July 1956, we – the Chinese Islamic Hajj Delegation – after completing our pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, visited several Arab and Islamic countries to extend greetings to our Muslim brothers. In late August, we arrived in Jordan.

    Syria and Jordan are neighboring countries, their borders adjoin, and the distance between the two capitals is very short, with a very flat road leading directly to each. We left Damascus by car at a little after eight in the morning and arrived at the Jordanian border at dusk.

    We were the first group of people from People's China to visit Jordan. There were only a handful of overseas Chinese of Uyghur and Kazakh ethnicity in Jordan; no Hui or Han Chinese. But as soon as we arrived at the border, we were warmly received. As we went through entry procedures, the burly border guards wearing copper hats and the customs officers in khaki uniforms flocked around, constantly saying "al-Sin, al-Sha'biya" (People's China) and "Zhou Enlai" in Arabic. Soon, fragrant black tea was offered, and the conversation grew from two people to over a dozen. Someone mentioned "Communist China," and was immediately corrected by other Jordanians who said, "It should be called People's China." One stout soldier said: "We haven't met Chinese friends, but we are no strangers to the name of Zhou Enlai. We know about the Five Principles and his speech at the Asian-African Conference." They asked to take photos with us. Photos were taken two or three times, and more and more people came, all vying to take pictures with the representatives of People's China. We were not inspected at all, and, amidst the "Salaam" (Islamic greeting, meaning "May God grant you peace and mercy") and cheers, the car sped into the city of Amman as if we were being welcomed.

    Amman, the capital of Jordan, is an ancient city, known in ancient times as "Philadelphia."

    In Amman, remnants of the Roman Empire are visible everywhere. Opposite the Philadelphia Hotel, where we stayed, is the famous Roman amphitheater. Amman has a population of over a million and is situated in a ring of mountains, serving as the political and commercial center of Jordan. However, the people of Jordan live in hardship. Most shops are small stores, and Bedouins wearing red checkered headscarves and black robes are commonly seen on the streets. Their clothing and living conditions are still very simple. This is the result of imperialism and feudal rule. Their lives are centuries apart from the luxury of Hussein's palace. The palace is on a hillside, with rows of guards wearing copper hats and holding spears standing on high stone steps, making it easy to imagine the bloody rule of this chieftain-like king.

    The friendship of the Jordanian people toward us is unforgettable. Three of us went to buy things, and the shop assistant at the silk shop, knowing that we were Muslims from People's China, said, "This is your own shop. Please choose whatever you like!" In a bookstore, we were surrounded by young people and could barely squeeze through. People rushed to shake our hands, saying "Salaam," and shouting "Long live People's China," "Long live peace," "Long live Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai!" Someone shouted "Long live People's China" in Chinese. After talking, we learned that he had visited China in 1955. One of us went to a barber shop for a haircut, and encountered the same scene. We chatted while getting a haircut, and the barber shop turned into a symposium. More and more people gathered at the door. After the haircut, two unknown Jordanian friends enthusiastically escorted us all the way back to the hotel.

    On our way to Jerusalem, we passed the Jordanian Dead Sea, one of the three major Dead Seas in the world. Leaving Amman, we passed through a stretch of flat sand and entered undulating mountains. The journey from Amman to the Dead Sea is seventy-five kilometers, and halfway through the journey, we were already below sea level. We could see the remnants of the seabed, with the rocks eroded by seawater into layers, bringing people into a strange realm. There was not a blade of grass here, and the sand and stones along the way sparkled with the luster of crystallized salt. The Dead Sea is now one thousand three hundred feet below sea level, forty-six miles long, nine miles wide, and one thousand two hundred feet deep at its deepest point. The Dead Sea is a wealth for the Jordanian people, containing rich industrial raw materials. The salt content of the seawater is said to reach 26%, and it also contains a lot of magnesium. However, this resource is also controlled by a British company, which is investing in building a factory. Arriving at the tomb of the wife of the Prophet "Yaqub", we could see the Arab refugee areas where homeless people were driven out by Israel. Endless tents and people sleeping in the open were enduring lives where they could not get enough to eat.

    The people of Jerusalem (Al-Quds in Arabic) have varying beliefs in Islam, Christianity, and Orthodox Christianity. When we arrived in Jerusalem, the Jordanian people gave us unforgettable friendship. At the famous Dome of the Rock and the ancient Al-Aqsa Mosque (one of the three holy sites of Islam), we met a Jordanian youth who had been to China. Although he had just been released from prison on trumped-up charges such as demanding national independence, he waited for us for two days at the Dome of the Rock. Everywhere, people asked to take pictures with us. On the way to visit the relics of the Byzantine Dynasty dating back one thousand six hundred years, passing through the market, under the Arab-style awnings of the market, the Jordanian people spontaneously formed a welcoming crowd. Shoemakers and shop assistants, wherever we went, automatically stopped business, exchanged "Salaam," some rushed to shake hands, and some followed us. When leaving Jerusalem, an unknown white-haired old man stopped our car. He stood on our car and spoke the heartfelt voice of the Jordanian people. He said to the surrounding crowd: "These are the Muslims from People's China. People's China is our loyal friend. They supported Egypt – our Arab brothers! As for us, if someone invades us, we believe that great China is on our side, because they supported our brothers in opposing imperialism!" The old man shouted, trembling with excitement, "Long live People's China!" Immediately, the streets echoed with cries of "Long live People's China!" (Attached picture)

    忆约旦之行
    刘东声
    1956年7月，我们——中国伊斯兰教朝觐团，在朝完了圣地麦加之后，访问了几个阿拉伯和伊斯兰教国家。向这些国家的穆斯林兄弟问候致意。8月下旬，我们到达了约旦。
    叙利亚和约旦是毗邻的，国境相接，两个首都之间距离很近，有一条很平坦的公路可以直达。我们早晨八点多钟从大马士革乘汽车出发，黄昏时分就到了约旦国境。
    我们是人民中国第一批到约旦的人。在约旦只有极少的维吾尔、哈萨克族华侨，回汉民都没有。但是我们刚一到达边境，就受到了热情的接待。当我们办理入境手续时，戴着铜帽子的魁梧的边防军和穿黄卡其布制服的海关人员，纷纷走拢来不断用阿拉伯语说“悉尼、沙尔比叶”（人民中国）和“周恩来”。一时送来了浓香的红茶，谈话由二人增加到十几个人。有人说“共产党中国”如何，马上被其他约旦人给纠正说“应该说人民中国”，其中一个胖胖的军人说：“中国朋友没有见过，但是周恩来的名字我们可不陌生，五项原则和亚非会议上他的发言，我们是知道的。”他们要求和我们一起拍了照片。合影拍了二、三次，来的人愈来愈多，都争着和人民中国代表们合影。我们丝毫未受检查，像夹道欢迎一样在“色兰”（伊斯兰教徒问候语，意思是“上帝给你安宁和慈惠”）声和欢呼声中汽车驰入了安曼城。
    约旦的首都安曼，是一个古老的城市，古代名字叫“费里代里非亚”。
    在安曼，罗马帝国时代的古迹到处可见，在我们住的费城旅馆对面就是有名的罗马时代古迹“斗兽场”。安曼有一百几十万人口，正处在一个山环里，是约旦政治和商业的中心。但是约旦的人民生活是很困苦的，商店以小店铺居多，街上常见到戴红格布头巾、身披黑大袍的贝都印族人，他们的衣着和生活还非常简陋，这是帝国主义和封建主统治的结果，他们的生活几乎与侯赛因王宫的豪华要差上几个世纪。王宫在山坡上，高高的石台阶上站着一排排戴铜帽子手持长矛的卫兵，使人不难想见出这个酋长式的国王的血腥统治。
    约旦人民对我们的友谊，是难忘的。我们有三个人去买东西，绸布店的店员知道我们是人民中国的穆斯林以后，他说：“这个就是你自己的铺子，请随便拣选吧！”在一个书店里，我们被青年们包围了起来，已经挤不出去了，人们争先恐后地和我们握手，说“色兰”，高呼“人民中国万岁”，“和平万岁”，“毛泽东周恩来万岁”，有人用汉语喊了“人民中国万岁”，经过谈话才知道他在1955年曾到中国访问过。我们有人去理发店理发，也遇到同样的场面，一面理发一面攀谈，一时理发店竟成了座谈会，门口的人愈来愈多，理完发，有二位不相识的约旦朋友热情地一路送我们回旅馆。
    我们在去耶路撒冷的途中，经过世界三大死海之一的约旦死海。从安曼出来一片平沙过后就进入起伏的山中。从安曼到死海七十五公里，走到一半路就到了海平以下了。可以看到海底的遗迹，山石被海水冲刷得一层层地，把人带入了一个奇异的境界，这里一根草也没有，沿路沙石中闪着结晶盐的光彩，现在的死海低于海平一千三百英尺，有四十六英里长九英里宽，深处有一千二百英尺。死海是约旦人民的一项财富，它蕴有丰富的工业原料，海水含盐量据说达到26％，镁也很多。但是这一资源也是操在一个英国公司，正在投资建厂。到了“牙古伯”先知夫人的坟地，就可以看到被以色列赶出来无家可归的阿拉伯难民区。无边的帐篷和露宿的人们度着无法吃饱的生活。
    耶路撒冷（阿拉伯名古都斯）的人民是间有信仰伊斯兰教、基督教和东正教的。我们到了耶路撒冷，约旦的人民又给了我们难忘的友谊。在著名的悬石殿和古老的乃白威大寺（伊斯兰教三大圣地之一），我们遇到了一位曾到过中国的约旦青年，虽然他刚以要求民族独立等莫须有罪名被囚出狱不久，但是在悬石殿等了我们两天。到处有人要求合影；在去参观保存有一千六百年前拜占廷王朝时代的古迹的路上，经过市场，在阿拉伯式的钻板棚市场下，约旦人民自发地形成夹道欢迎，皮鞋工和店员，在我们所到之处，都自动停止营业，互道“色兰”，有的赶来握手，有的跟着我们。在离开耶路撒冷时，一位不相识的白发老者拦住了汽车，他站在我们汽车上，说出了约旦人民心底的呼声，他向围拢来的群众说：“这是人民中国的穆斯林，人民中国是我们忠实的朋友，他们支援了埃及——我们阿拉伯兄弟！对于我们，如果有人侵略我们，相信伟大的中国是我们一伙的，因为他们支援了我们兄弟来反对帝国主义！”老者激动得颤抖着喊：“人民中国万岁”，接着，街上立刻此起彼伏地喊起“人民中国万岁”来。（附图片）
