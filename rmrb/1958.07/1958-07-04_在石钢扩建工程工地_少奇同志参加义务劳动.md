The news of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's participation in voluntary labor at the construction site greatly encouraged the voluntary laborers present today. They challenged each other, determined to complete the expansion project ahead of schedule.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi worked until dusk before finishing work with everyone, and left the construction site amidst the cheers of the workers.
