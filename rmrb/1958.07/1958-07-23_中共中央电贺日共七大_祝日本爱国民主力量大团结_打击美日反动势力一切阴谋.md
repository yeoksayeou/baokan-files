Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on the 21st to the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, congratulating the convocation of the Congress. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, transferred to all comrades of the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, extends warm, fraternal congratulations to the Congress of your Party.

Since its establishment, the Japanese Communist Party has waged a long-term struggle under conditions of severe white terror, opposing the militarist oppression of the Japanese people and opposing Japan's bloody imperialist aggression against China and other Asian countries. After World War II, the Japanese Communist Party raised the banner of struggle against US imperialism, making every effort to establish a new Japan of peace, independence, democracy, and prosperity, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. History proves that the Japanese Communists are the most loyal defenders of the interests of the Japanese nation and people, and staunch fighters for defending peace in Asia and the world.

Currently, a new danger of war caused by the armed intervention of US-British imperialism in the Middle East is threatening the people of all countries. The reactionary forces in Japan are colluding with US imperialism, attempting to revive Japanese militarism, suppress the Japanese people, and vainly attempt to drag Japan onto the old road of imperialism, and to make Japan the main base for US imperialism to launch aggressive wars in the Far East. In order to safeguard the interests of the Japanese people, the Japanese Communist Party is uniting the strength of the working class and patriotic and peace-loving people from all walks of life, launching a struggle to drive US troops out of Japan, abolish US bases, strive for peace and independence, and safeguard the living standards of the Japanese people, establishing a united front of democratic forces against US imperialism, in order to thoroughly expose and crack down on all the conspiracies of the American aggressors and the domestic reactionary forces in Japan. The struggle of the Japanese people and the Japanese Communist Party is by no means isolated; it has the warm sympathy and support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. We believe that although the road to victory for the Japanese people will be tortuous and arduous, the just struggle of the Japanese people will surely be victorious; the conspiracy of the American aggressors to make Japan their reliable war base, and the conspiracy of the Japanese reactionaries to take the old road of imperialism and militarism, are doomed to bankruptcy.

The convocation of the Seventh Congress of the Japanese Communist Party will surely make new contributions to strengthening the unity of the Party and further consolidating the ideological and political unity of the entire Party. At the same time, the convocation of this Congress will surely strengthen the unity of Japanese workers, peasants, and all patriotic and democratic forces who oppose US aggression and oppose new wars, and will surely encourage the Japanese people to carry out a courageous and forward-looking struggle for peace, independence, and democracy. We wish the Congress a complete success. We wish the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people further development.

                                      The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
                         July 21, 1958

    中共中央电贺日共七大
    祝日本爱国民主力量大团结
    打击美日反动势力一切阴谋
    新华社22日讯  中国共产党中央委员会在21日打电报给日本共产党第七次代表大会，祝贺大会的召开。贺电全文如下：日本共产党中央委员会转日本共产党第七次代表大会的全体同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表中国共产党全体党员和中国人民，向你们党的代表大会致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    日本共产党自从成立以后，就在严重的白色恐怖的条件下，进行了反对军国主义压迫日本人民、反对日本对中国和亚洲各国进行血腥的帝国主义侵略的长期斗争。第二次世界大战以后，日本共产党举起了反对美帝国主义的斗争旗帜，为建立和平、独立、民主、繁荣的新日本与保卫亚洲和世界和平而尽了一切努力。历史证明：日本共产党人是日本民族和人民利益的最忠实的捍卫者，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的坚强战士。
    目前，由于美英帝国主义武装干涉中东而引起的新的战争危险正在威胁着世界各国人民。日本的反动势力勾结美帝国主义，力图恢复日本军国主义，镇压日本人民，妄想把日本拖上帝国主义的老路，并且使日本成为美帝国主义在远东发动侵略战争的主要基地。日本共产党为了保卫日本人民的利益，正在团结工人阶级和各阶层爱国爱和平人民的力量，展开把美军赶出日本、取消美国基地、争取和平、独立和维护日本人民生活水平的斗争，建立反对美帝国主义的民主力量的联合战线，以彻底揭露和打击美国侵略者和日本国内反动势力的一切阴谋。日本人民和日本共产党的斗争决不是孤立的，它有中国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民的热烈同情和支持。我们相信，尽管日本人民取得胜利的道路将是曲折的、艰苦的，但是日本人民的正义斗争是一定会胜利的；美国侵略者妄图把日本作为它可靠的战争基地的阴谋，日本反动派妄图走帝国主义和军国主义老路的阴谋，是注定要破产的。
    日本共产党第七次代表大会的召开，对于加强党的团结、对于进一步巩固全党的思想上和政治上的一致，必将作出新的贡献。同时，这次大会的召开，必将加强日本工人、农民和一切反对美国侵略势力、反对新战争的爱国民主力量的团结，必将鼓舞日本人民为争取和平、独立、民主而进行勇往直前的斗争。我们仅祝大会获得圆满的成功。我们仅祝中日两国人民的友好进一步发展。
                                      中国共产党中央委员会
                         一九五八年七月二十一日
