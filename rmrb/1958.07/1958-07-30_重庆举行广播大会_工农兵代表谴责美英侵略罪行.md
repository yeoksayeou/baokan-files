Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th. Chongqing held the "Chongqing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Rally Against US-British Aggression in the Middle East Broadcast Rally" on the 27th and 28th. The city's broad masses listened to the live broadcast of the rally.

Wang Youguo, an old worker from the Chongqing Port Authority of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, who personally suffered from the bullying of US and British imperialism, denounced the crimes of US and British imperialism in consistently oppressing the Chinese people. He angrily said that the Yangtze River sailors had long been subjected to the humiliation of US and British imperialism. At that time, the imperialist warships could arbitrarily enter our inland rivers, and the Yangtze River became the imperialists' blood-sucking tube, and countless Chinese resources were plundered by imperialism through the Yangtze River. Wang Youguo warned US and British imperialism that the era of imperialism's rampage is gone forever.

Jiang Anyu, a volunteer soldier who won the Second Class Warrior Medal of Honor in Korea and is now a lieutenant officer in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Zhu Shiqi, a demobilized soldier and worker at the Chongqing Shipyard, exposed that US imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger based on their experience of fighting against the American aggressors on the battlefield. Jin Yonghua, the mother of the revolutionary martyr Wang Pu, who was killed by the Kuomintang-US Cooperation Organization executioners, angrily said that she would never allow US imperialism to use the means of poisoning the Chinese people in the past to poison the people of the Middle East again. She expressed her willingness to do her best to defend world peace.

Wang Xianting, chairman of the trade union of Wangjiang Machine Factory, Tang Zhizhong, a young steelmaking worker from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Zeng Xiangqing, a female worker and advanced producer from the 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, Zhang Wenshi, an engineer from the Third Iron and Steel Factory, and peasant representatives Wu Shaochen and Chen Shihua, expressed their serious protests against the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East at the meeting.
