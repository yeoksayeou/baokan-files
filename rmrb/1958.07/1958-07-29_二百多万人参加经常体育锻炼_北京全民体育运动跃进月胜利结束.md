    Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The Beijing Mass Sports Movement Leap Forward Month, which began on June 6th, has concluded successfully.

    After more than a month of the Leap Forward Month, the slogan "Everyone participates in ten minutes of physical activity every day, strengthening the body to do more work for socialist construction" has become a household phrase. A habit and atmosphere of consciously and regularly engaging in physical exercise is gradually forming throughout the city.

    According to incomplete statistics, more than 2.2 million people in the city participated in regular physical exercise during this month. Workers, students, and cadres who had a certain foundation in physical exercise in the past actively participated in the Leap Forward Month activities. Even handicraftsmen, shop assistants, suburban farmers, and even street residents, who had relatively poor foundations in physical activity in the past, actively participated in sports activities. The Beijing Musical Instrument Factory has more than 400 workers. In the past, there was only a basketball team of a dozen people. After the Sports Leap Forward Month, all the workers living in the factory participated in exercise. The activities of this Sports Movement Leap Forward Month were rich and colorful, reflecting the spirit of adapting to people, places, and times. It also implemented the spirit of diligence and thrift in running sports. If there was no sports field, the masses were mobilized to build it through voluntary labor. If there was no sports equipment, they made it themselves using waste materials or found substitutes. For example, some grassroots units of the Dongcheng District Non-Staple Food Management Office did not have barbells, so they used the wheels of delivery carts as weightlifting equipment.

### 二百多万人参加经常体育锻炼  北京全民体育运动跃进月胜利结束

    二百多万人参加经常体育锻炼
    北京全民体育运动跃进月胜利结束
    新华社28日讯　从6月6日开始的北京市全民体育运动跃进月的活动已经胜利结束。
    经过一个多月的跃进月，“每人每天参加十分钟的体育活动，炼好身体，为社会主义建设干更多的工作”的口号已经家喻户晓，自觉地经常地从事体育锻炼的风气和习惯正在全市范围内逐渐形成。
    据不完全统计，在这一个月里全市有二百二十多万人参加了经常的体育锻炼。过去有一定体育锻炼基础的工人、学生和机关干部等都踊跃参加了跃进月的活动。就是过去体育活动基础比较差的手工业工人、商店店员、郊区农民甚至街道的居民也都积极地参加了体育活动。北京乐器厂有四百多工人，过去只有一个十几个人的篮球队，经过体育跃进月，全厂住在厂内的工人都参加了锻练。这次体育运动跃进月的活动内容丰富多彩，体现了因人、因地、因时制宜的精神，也贯彻了勤俭办体育的精神，没有体育场发动群众义务劳动来修建，没有体育器材便自己动手利用废料制作或找代用品。如东城区副食品管理处有的基层单位没有杠铃，便用送货板车的轮子作举重器。
