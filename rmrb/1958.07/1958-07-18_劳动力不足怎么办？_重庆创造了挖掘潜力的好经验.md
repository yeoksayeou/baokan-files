    What to do about labor shortages?
    Chongqing has created good experiences in tapping potential.
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, July 17th, reporter Liao Yongxiang) Chongqing’s Party and government leading organs have adopted revolutionary measures, from vigorously carrying out technological innovation and adjusting labor organization, to solve the serious labor shortage problem faced after the great development of industry.
    The tasks of many factories in Chongqing this second half of the year have increased by one to two times compared to the first half of the year, and there is an urgent need for expansion, reconstruction, and additional manpower and equipment. According to preliminary statistics, the city’s steel, machinery, construction, and other departments urgently need to add more than 40,000 workers. What should be done? Some people advocate asking for people from rural areas outside the city. Others only focus on strengthening labor intensity and other aspects. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and relevant leading departments criticized these unrealistic views and emphasized that the plan to solve the labor force problem should first fully tap the potential within enterprises.
    The specific methods for tapping the potential within enterprises are: (1) Vigorously promote semi-mechanization, mechanization, and automation; (2) Implement one person with multiple skills and one machine with multiple uses; (3) Minimize non-production personnel in factories and mines as much as possible, and conscientiously implement the system of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in enterprise management; (4) Adjust labor organization, use labor rationally and effectively, strengthen labor protection, and improve attendance rate; (5) Fully tap the labor potential of workers' families, and absorb workers' families to participate in all service and auxiliary labor.
    Many factories and mines have adopted these methods and have achieved good results. For example, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has large production and capital construction tasks and urgently needs to increase transportation workers and auxiliary workers. Recently, the company vigorously reduced non-production personnel, organized cadres, odd-job workers, and workers' families, 1,800 people in all, to take turns participating in labor, and changed the shoulder-carrying and back-carrying of hundreds of transportation workers to machine operation, which timely and effectively alleviated the labor shortage.
    Chongqing has also specially established a Labor Investigation and Planning Committee and an office for solving labor problems, which are conducting a comprehensive investigation, organization, and unified arrangement of the labor force in streets, agencies, schools, troops, and suburban agricultural cooperatives. The specific methods are: (1) Plan the production, life, and education of the city's residents, implement labor queueing, use talents according to their abilities, and fully tap the potential of social labor. At the same time, vigorously run street nurseries, public canteens, and other collective welfare undertakings to reduce women's housework and free up time to participate in service and auxiliary labor, so as to draw all the labor force into the production and capital construction departments. (2) Readjust the commercial network, and abolish or merge too many and too concentrated stores and stalls, and draw out a large number of surplus personnel. Strive to transfer women to take charge of retail work in stores and many light storage and other work, and draw out the full labor force to strengthen the production front. (3) Institutions of higher education and production units are linked, industrial schools combine internships with work, and general middle schools arrange time according to the labor training plan and take turns to participate in labor. (4) Cadres of agencies and troops take turns to participate in production in construction sites, factories, and mines. (5) Factories and mines sign contracts with agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural cooperative members take turns to be workers.
    All relevant units in the city are seizing the time to implement these methods. Recently, they have cleaned up and rectified street production teams and scattered construction workers, supplemented them with family members of residents with stronger physical strength, and transferred more than 30,000 people to work in factories, mines, and capital construction departments. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee has made a decision that each cadre in the agency will participate in labor for two months each year, and 15% of the cadres in the city will be transferred each time, rotating six times. The first batch of 1,500 cadres participating in the construction of the iron and steel plant will be able to depart before the end of the month. Students in secondary schools and above in the city will also take advantage of their summer vacation to take turns participating in capital construction. Several districts in the rural suburbs of the city, such as Nan'an, have also made overall plans, deciding to draw 10%-15% of the labor force to support industrial construction.
    In the organization and arrangement of the labor force, the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and relevant leading departments, according to the principle of taking steel as the key link and driving the development of other industries, pay attention to first ensuring the needs of key factories such as steel and machinery, and key capital construction projects, and resolutely postpone, compress, or cancel secondary construction projects, so that limited manpower can be used in the most critical places.
    After taking these measures, the first batch of labor force urgently needed in the city has been basically resolved.

### 劳动力不足怎么办？  重庆创造了挖掘潜力的好经验

    劳动力不足怎么办？
    重庆创造了挖掘潜力的好经验
    本报重庆17日电　记者廖永祥报道：重庆市党政领导机关采取革命的措施，从大搞技术革新和调整劳动组织几个方面来解决工业大发展以后面临的劳动力严重不足的问题。
    重庆市不少工厂今年下半年的任务比上半年增大一倍到两倍以上，急需扩建、改建，增添人力、设备。据初步统计，全市钢铁、机械、建筑等部门急需增添工人四万多名。怎么办呢？有的人主张向外地农村要人。也有人只从加强劳动强度等方面打主意。中共重庆市委和有关领导部门批判了这类不切实际的看法，在解决劳动力问题的方案中，强调了首先要充分发掘企业内部的潜力。
    发掘企业内部潜力的具体办法是：（1）大搞半机械化、机械化和自动化；（2）实行一人多艺，一机多用；（3）尽量压缩厂矿非生产人员，认真贯彻干部参加劳动、工人参加企业管理的制度；（4）调整劳动组织，合理、有效地使用劳动力，加强劳动保护，提高出勤率；（5）充分发掘工人家属的劳动潜力，一切服务性、辅助性的劳动都吸收工人家属参加。
    许多厂矿单位采取这些办法，都收到很好的效果。例如，重庆钢铁公司生产和基本建设任务都很大，急需增加运输工人、辅助工人。最近这个公司大力压缩非生产人员、组织干部、勤杂工人和工人家属一千八百人轮流参加劳动，把几百名运输工人的肩挑背驮改为机器操作，及时、有效地缓和了劳动力的紧张程度。
    重庆市还特地成立了劳动调查规划委员会和解决劳动力问题的办公室，正在对街道、机关、学校、部队、郊区农业社的劳动力进行全面的调查、组织和统一安排。具体作法是：（1）对全市居民的生产、生活、教育进行规划，实行劳动排队，因材使用，充分发掘社会劳动潜力。同时，大办街道托儿所、公共食堂等集体福利事业，减轻妇女家务劳动，腾出时间参加服务性和辅助性的劳动，把全劳动力抽到生产和基本建设部门中去。（2）重新调整商业网，撤销、合并过多和过于集中的商店、小摊，把大批多余的人力抽出来。商店零售工作和不少轻便的保管等工作，尽量调换妇女担任，抽出全劳动力加强生产战线。（3）中等以上学校和生产单位挂钩，工业学校把实习同工作结合起来，一般中学根据劳动锻炼的规划，排定时间，轮流参加劳动。（4）机关干部和部队轮流到工地、厂矿参加生产。（5）厂矿和农业社订合同，农业社员轮流当工人。
    全市各有关单位正在抓紧实行这些办法，最近已将街道生产组、零散建筑工人进行了清理和整顿，由体力较强的居民家属加以补充，抽调了三万多人到厂矿企业和基本建设部门工作。中共重庆市委已经作出决定，机关干部每人每年参加两个月劳动，全市每次抽调15％的干部参加，六次轮完。第一批参加修建钢铁厂的一千五百名干部，月底以前就可出发。全市中等以上学校的学生也要利用暑假休息时间轮流参加基本建设。市郊农村南岸等几个区也已作了通盘规划，决定抽10％—15％的人力支援工业建设。
    在劳动力的组织、安排上，中共重庆市委和有关领导部门根据以钢为纲、带动其他工业发展的原则，注意首先保证钢铁、机械等重点工厂和基本建设重点工程的需要，坚决将次要的建设项目加以推迟、压缩或撤销，使有限的人力使用到最紧要的地方。
    采取这些措施以后，全市第一批急需的劳动力已经基本上得到解决。
