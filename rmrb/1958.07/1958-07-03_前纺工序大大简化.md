    Pre-spinning Processes Greatly Simplified

    (Our report) The workers of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 and Cotton Mill No. 12 have successively succeeded in creating a "Cleaning and Carding Combined Machine" and a "Carding, Drawing, and Roving Combined Machine," which greatly simplifies the pre-spinning production processes.

    The advantage of the cleaning and carding combined machine of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6 is that after the raw cotton is processed by the first cleaning machine, it can be directly transferred to the carding machine for carding, eliminating the original third cleaning process.

    The "Carding, Drawing, and Roving Combined Machine" of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 12 is made by adding drafting rollers and a double sliver device to the original carding machine. The cleaned cotton lap is carded by the carding machine, and then directly spun into yarn using two slivers that have been combined through different processes. This eliminates the drawing and roving processes (four steps), and also increases the strength of the cotton yarn.

    前纺工序大大简化
    本报讯　上海国棉六厂和国棉十二厂职工，创造“清花钢丝联合机”和“钢丝并条粗纱联合机”相继成功，大大简化了前纺的生产工序。
    国棉六厂的清钢联合机的好处是：原棉经过头道清花车处理后，就可以直接跳到钢丝车上去梳理，原有的第三道清花工序被废除了。
    国棉十二厂的“钢丝、并条、粗纱联合机”，是在原来的钢丝车上，加装牵伸罗拉和双棉条装置而成的。清花棉卷经过钢丝车的梳理，再利用两根棉条经过不同行程并合，就可直接纺成细纱。这就可以取消并条粗纱工序（四道手续），棉纱强力也可提高。
