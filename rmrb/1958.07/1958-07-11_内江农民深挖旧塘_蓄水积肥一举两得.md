    Neijiang Farmers Deepen Old Ponds
    One Stone, Two Birds - Water Storage and Fertilizer Accumulation
    (Our report) Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, launched a water conservancy crash program centered on deepening old ponds in June. In a very short period of time, the county increased the water storage capacity of existing water facilities by more than a quarter, with benefits seen in the same year; at the same time, it accumulated more than one billion jin of pond silt as fertilizer.
    Neijiang County originally had more than 4,000 ponds, covering an area of more than 20,000 mu, but the water storage capacity was not large. After investigation and research, the Neijiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China found that as long as all the old ponds in the county were deepened by two meters and the pond embankments were raised, without building new ponds, the increased water storage capacity would be sufficient for the expanded three-season fields next year, and the pond silt is the best topdressing fertilizer for crops such as corn and sugarcane. At the same time, due to the drought, the vast majority of ponds have dried up, providing conditions for deepening. Therefore, it was decided to seize the favorable opportunity when the spring planting work was basically completed and there was still some time before the early rice harvest, and adopt the method of concentrating efforts to rush the construction, setting off a summer upsurge in water conservancy construction.

    内江农民深挖旧塘
    蓄水积肥一举两得
    本报讯　四川省内江县在6月份开展了一个深挖旧塘为中心的水利突击运动月。全县在很短时间内使现有水利设施蓄水容量增加四分之一强，当年就能见效；同时还积下十多亿斤塘泥做肥料。
    内江县原有水塘四千多口，塘地面积达二万多亩，但蓄水量并不大。中共内江县委经过调查研究，发现只要将全县旧塘深挖二公尺，再加高塘堤，不另建新塘，增加的蓄水量就足够明年扩大的三季田使用，而塘泥又是玉米、甘蔗等作物最好的追肥，同时由于干旱，绝大多数塘已经干涸，为深挖提供了条件，因此，决定抓住大春栽种工作基本结束，距早稻收割还有一段时间的有利时机，采取集中力量赶修的办法，掀起一个夏季兴修水利运动热潮。　（刘宗棠）
