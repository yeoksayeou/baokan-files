Putian Reports Another High-Yield Record
Soybean Yield Reaches 936 Jin Per Mu

The 1.177 mu of soybeans planted by Chen Yalin, the youth production team leader, and Chen Wenbin, a member of the Wutuo Cooperative in Putian County, Fujian Province, yielded 1102 jin and 8 liang in actual harvest, averaging 936 jin and 11 liang per mu. This is 41 jin more than the high-yield record of 895 jin and 11 liang per mu of soybeans recently set by the Liuzhuo Cooperative in the same county.

Chen Yalin and others achieved high soybean yields through: early sowing and dense planting, sowing before the "Rain Water" solar term, using 30 jin of "Dahuang" seeds per mu, applying 1000 dan of mixed earth fertilizer (three times more than in previous years) and 200 dan of fine sand, deep plowing to a depth of six cun, and ensuring rational irrigation and pest elimination. As a result, the stalks were tall and strong, the grains were full, and each plant produced an average of 61 pods, with 1800 grains weighing one jin.

    莆田再传高产纪录
    大豆亩产936斤
    福建省莆田县乌坨社青年生产队长陈亚林、团员陈文斌等种植的一点一七七亩大豆，实收一千一百零二斤八两，平均亩产九百三十六斤十一两，比这个县的柳卓社新近创造的亩产大豆八百九十五斤十一两的高产纪录多四十一斤。
    陈亚林等取得的大豆高产经验是：早播密植，“雨水”前播种，每亩用“大黄”种三十斤，施土杂肥一千担（比往年多三倍）、细沙二百担，深耕六寸，同时作到合理灌溉和消灭虫害。因此，秸株高大粗壮，颗粒饱满，平均每株结夹六十一个，一千八百粒就有一斤。
