    Two Copies of "Red Flag"
    Mao Qi
    Some time ago, I had two copies of the "Red Flag" magazine on my bedside table. Every day, when I returned from working in the fields, I would pick them up and flip through a few pages, even though both were the same first issue.

    The story of these two copies of "Red Flag" has a little episode! Towards the end of May, I saw the news of the "Red Flag" launch in the newspaper. Soon after, I saw the eye-catching advertisement. "Introducing a Cooperative" was an article written by our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Other articles were by comrades such as Chen Boda, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Yang. Just looking at the titles, one knew how rich and important they were. I absolutely had to subscribe to this "Red Flag," so I took time off from labor and rushed to the nearby town's post office to subscribe. Unexpectedly, the post office had not yet received specific instructions and was not yet taking subscriptions, leaving me disappointed.

    On the way back, I kept thinking that I was here to engage in labor and temper myself to transform my thinking. To transform my thinking, I had to plant the "Red Flag." But not even being able to see the theoretical publication sponsored by the Party Central Committee was such a headache. At this moment, my petit-bourgeois intellectual problem resurfaced; I muttered to myself: down here to do labor? I can handle even the stinkiest and heaviest work, but this "cultural nourishment" isn't as convenient as in the city. That day, I felt a sense of loss. Although I labored, my heart was still thinking about "Red Flag."

    The next day, a comrade from the county newspaper came to solicit稿 (something like "write a piece" or "solicit a contribution"). I thought this was a good opportunity, and it would be great if he could buy me a copy in the county seat. But then I thought, at the moment, all aspects are leaping forward, everyone is leaping forward, so to ask someone else to do the job seems wrong. Thinking about it over and over again, it was hard to open my mouth, but I was impatiently anxious. Finally, after discussing official matters, I bit the bullet and told him my wish. "'Red Flag'! Can be done, can be done, I'm also planning to subscribe as soon as I get back!" This really made me overjoyed.

    In the following days, I was looking forward to it day and night. On the afternoon of June 12th, I cut wheat all afternoon, my waist ached, my legs were sore, and I trudged back. Just as I reached the village entrance, the neighbor's primary school student ran towards me like reporting good news, saying: "Comrade Mao! Comrade Mao! There's a letter for you, and two rolled-up books!" I felt energetic all over, and all fatigue was forgotten. I dashed back in one bound. First, I picked up one of the rolled-up books, with the county newspaper's name on it. I happily opened it, and sure enough, it was the "Red Flag" I had been longing for. As soon as I opened it, I read Chairman Mao's article. The landlady, seeing my expression, jokingly asked: "What are you looking at? So attentively? Could it be your wife wrote again? It's getting dark, you can't see!" At this moment, I realized that the address on the other rolled-up letter was Jiaotong University. It must be some magazine sent by my spouse, so I put down the "Red Flag" in my hand and unwrapped this one. As soon as I unwrapped it, I laughed to death with joy! It was another copy of "Red Flag"! How warm friendship and love are! But even greater warmth - the sun of truth - "Red Flag" - is shining on my heart!

    Of course, I couldn't, as I said earlier, keep both copies of "Red Flag" at my home. Soon, I gave the other copy to a friend who had been longing for "Red Flag" for a long time. If I was extremely happy when I received "Red Flag," then how about him? Naturally, it was the same.

### 两本“红旗”

    两本“红旗”
    毛锜
    在前些时我的床头上放着两本“红旗”杂志，每天当我从田间劳动回来的时候，总要拿起来翻几页，尽管两本都同是第一期。
    说起这两本“红旗”来，倒有一段小小的插曲哩！5月尾上，我就从报上看到“红旗”创刊的消息，接着不久又看到了那幅醒目的广告，“介绍一个合作社”是我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席写的文章，其他还有陈伯达、张闻天、周扬等同志的文章，光一看标题，就知道其丰富和重要了。这个“红旗”无论如何也非订一份不可，于是我抽劳动之暇，连忙跑到附近小镇的邮局去预订，不料邮局还没接到具体通知，还不订，落得个扫兴而归。
    在回来的路上，我一劲地想，自己是下来劳动锻炼改造思想的，改造思想?：就得插“红旗”，可是连党中央主办的理论刊物都看不到，多伤脑筋，这个时候，我那小资产阶级知识分子的毛病又来了；内心嘀咕着：下来劳动?；再臭再重的活都能干，就是这个“文化食粮”不如城市那么方便。这一天，我若有所失，虽然劳动，但心里老还是想着“红旗”。
    第二天，有一个县报同志来约我写稿，我想这是个好机会，托他为我在县城里买一本该多好。可是转念一想，目下，各方面都在跃进，人人都在跃进，让别人代劳。想来想去不便启齿，但又焦急的不行。终于在谈完正事之后，就硬着头皮把自己这个愿望告诉了他。“红旗！能办到，能办到，我也准备马上回去就订阅哩！”这真使我喜出望外。
    这以后的几天，我就在日思夜盼。6月12日下午，我割了一下午麦，腰疼腿酸，蹒跚地朝回走，刚走到村头，邻居的小学生像报告好消息的向我说：“毛同志！毛同志！有你的信，还有两个书卷卷呢！”我听了浑身是劲，疲劳全忘了，一个箭步就蹦了回去。第一个就先拿起一个书卷，上边有县报字样。我高兴的连忙打开，果然不错，正是我想望的“红旗”。一翻开我就读毛主席那篇文章，房东老大妈看了我的神气，打趣的问：“你看啥呀？那么用心，莫不是媳妇又来信了，天黑了，看不见了！”这时，我才意识到另一个书卷上的来信地址是交通大学，准是我爱人寄来的什么杂志，于是我才把手里的“红旗”放下，拆这一卷。一拆我真高兴的笑死了！又是一本“红旗”！友谊、爱情是多么温暖啊！？然而更大的温暖——真理的太阳——“红旗”，不正在照耀着我的心灵吗！？
    当然，不能像我前边所说的，把两本“红旗”都老放在自己的家里，很快，我就把另外一本送给了一位对“红旗”渴望已久的朋友。如果说我收到“红旗”的时候是万分高兴，他呢？自然也是一样。
