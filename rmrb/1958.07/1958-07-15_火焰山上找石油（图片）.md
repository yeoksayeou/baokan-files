Finding Oil on Flaming Mountain
Xinjiang's Turpan Basin has already discovered more than twenty oil-bearing structures and a large number of oil sand and oil slick outcrops. Legend has it that the "Flaming Mountain" described in Journey to the West is located here. The Flaming Mountain averages more than 500 meters in height and is composed of red rock, appearing red all over under the sunlight, like a furnace.

\tThe above picture shows a drilling rig in the Qiketai exploration area of Shanshan County, near Flaming Mountain, drilling for crude oil.

    火焰山上找石油
    新疆吐鲁番盆地已经发现了二十多个储油构造和大量的油砂油苗露头。传说西游记中描述的“火焰山”就在这里。火焰山平均有五百多公尺高，由红岩组成，在日光照射下遍山通红，像个火炉。
      上图是火焰山附近，鄯善县七克台探区的钻井正在钻探原油。
