Eisenhower Beats His Head
Ding Li

The American troops landed in Lebanon,
Baring their fangs and brandishing their claws to scare people.
Who knew the Lebanese iron fist was so fierce,
A chorus of teeth-knocking and claw-chopping sounds!
Afraid of claw-chopping, afraid of teeth-knocking,
American troops squat on the beach, not daring to climb.
Urgent telegrams shot to the White House,
Eisenhower beats his head.

    艾森豪威尔捶脑瓜
    丁力
    美军登陆黎巴嫩，
    张牙舞爪吓唬人。
    谁知黎巴嫩铁拳猛，
    一片敲牙斩爪声！
    怕斩爪，怕敲牙，
    美军蹲在沙滩不敢爬。
    急电拍到白宫去，
    艾森豪威尔捶脑瓜。
