Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: The Soviet Union is striving to complete the task of eliminating housing shortages within ten to twelve years, as proposed by the Party and the government, ahead of schedule. Currently, housing is being built in almost every city and village in the Soviet Union, and it has reached a high level of industrialization. This was stated by Rubanenko, a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, in a recent interview with our reporter.

He said that the scale of housing construction in the Soviet Union is currently unprecedented. During the current Sixth Five-Year Plan, the area of housing built with state investment will reach 215 million square meters, and the area of housing built by residents with state loans will be 113 million square meters. In addition, collective farm members will build 4 million houses themselves.

Such large-scale housing construction must be guaranteed by advanced construction technology. At present, the large wall panel assembly method has been widely promoted throughout the country. The advantage of building houses using this method is that it can save half the labor and time compared to ordinary brick houses, and the cost is also greatly reduced. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is planned to build 38 factories producing large wall panels. After these factories are completed, the wall panels and various prefabricated house parts produced each year can build houses with a residential area of 2.7 million square meters. In the next two or three years, half of the three- and five-story houses will be assembled using large wall panels.

Currently, the use of plastics and the standardization of designs are important topics in improving housing construction.

In order to meet the needs of the working people to build their own houses, the production of standard wood-assembled houses is being expanded, and by 1961, it will increase to twenty times that of 1956. A standard house designed for one family is also being promoted. The cost of this house is 30% lower than that of ordinary houses.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 5th: Moscow has formulated a seven-year long-term plan for housing construction. According to this plan, the per capita housing area in Moscow will increase by approximately one-fold compared to the present. This is a major leap forward in housing construction in Moscow.

Our reporter recently interviewed Comrade Balashev, Deputy Manager of the Moscow Construction Corporation. He said that according to the seven-year long-term plan, the company will undertake 65% of the city's housing construction tasks, building a total of 13 million square meters of housing. In total, the city's housing construction area will increase by 20 million square meters in the seven years starting from next year. The total residential area of Moscow before the revolution was only 11 million square meters.

After the completion of the seven-year long-term plan, the problem of housing shortages in Moscow can be basically solved; and by 1967, it will be completely solved. Balashev said that solving the problem of housing shortages means that each family has a separate set of rooms, with all kinds of complete modern equipment, and everyone has better living conditions than now. After the completion of the seven-year plan, each resident of Moscow will occupy an average of about twelve square meters of living space, excluding kitchens, bathrooms, and corridors.

The current and future housing construction will mainly be carried out in eight or nine new districts, such as the Southwest District, Cheryomushki, and Izmailovo. (Attached picture)

### 每个城市每个乡村都在大兴土木  苏联住宅建筑规模空前  莫斯科七年后住宅面积按人口计算将增加一倍

    每个城市每个乡村都在大兴土木
    苏联住宅建筑规模空前
    莫斯科七年后住宅面积按人口计算将增加一倍
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联各地正在争取提前完成党和政府提出的十年到十二年内消除住宅不足现象的任务。目前苏联几乎每个城市、每个乡村都在建筑住宅，而且已经达到高度工业化技术水平。这是苏联建筑科学院主席团委员鲁巴年科最近对本社记者说的。
    他说，现在苏联住宅建筑的规模是空前的。在目前的第六个五年计划期间，由国家投资兴建的住宅面积达两亿一千五百万平方公尺，由国家贷款帮助居民自建的有一亿一千三百万平方公尺，此外还有四百万幢房屋由集体农庄庄员自己建设。
    这样大规模的住宅建筑必须有先进的建筑技术来保证。目前大型墙板装配法已经普遍推广到全国。利用这种方法建筑住宅的好处是所花的劳动力和时间可以比普通的砖砌房屋节省一半，造价也大大降低。在第六个五年计划中，规定要建成三十八座生产大型墙板的工厂，这些工厂建成后每年生产的墙板和各种房屋预制品可以建造二百七十万平方公尺住宅面积的房子。在最近两、三年内，三、五层楼的住宅有一半将用大型墙板来装配。
    目前，利用塑料问题和标准设计问题是改进住宅建筑中的重要课题。
    为了满足劳动人民自己建筑住宅的需要，标准的木材装配的房屋正在扩大生产，到1961年，将增为1956年的二十倍。现在还正在推广一种为一个家庭居住而设计的标准住宅。这种住宅的造价要比一般住宅的造价低30％。
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　莫斯科已经制订出住宅建筑的七年远景计划。按照这个计划，莫斯科按人口平均的住宅面积，将比现在增加大约一倍。这是莫斯科在住宅建筑方面的一个大跃进。
    本社记者最近访问了莫斯科建筑总公司副经理巴拉歇夫同志。他说，按照七年远景计划，公司担负全市住宅建筑任务的65％，共将建筑一千三百万平方公尺住宅。全市总计，从明年起七年内，住宅建筑面积将增加两千万平方公尺。而革命前莫斯科全市的住宅总面积只不过一千一百万平方公尺。
    七年远景计划完成后，莫斯科市住宅不足的问题可以基本上得到解决；而到1967年，就将完全解决。巴拉歇夫说，解决住宅不足问题的意思是指每个家庭都有单独的一套房间，有各种齐全的近代化设备，每人都有比现在更好的居住条件。七年计划完成后，莫斯科每个居民平均将占有居住面积约十二平方公尺，厨房、浴室、走廊不计在内。
    目前和今后的住宅建筑主要在西南区、切廖穆什卡、伊兹马伊洛沃等八、九个新区中进行。（附图片）
