Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 24th. People from all walks of life in India have firmly expressed their support for the newly independent people of Iraq. Workers in the steel city of Jamshedpur and the coal city of Raniganj, as well as sailors in Mumbai, held rallies and demonstrations. In Calcutta, 150,000 students went on strike. Torchlight processions were also common throughout the country, with people unanimously condemning the US and British imperialists' armed aggression against Middle Eastern countries, celebrating the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and expressing support for the Iraqi people's struggle to defend their independence. Members of Parliament from the Communist Party of India, the People's Socialist Party, and the Congress Party also exposed the crimes of US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and the imperialists' attempts to strangle the Republic of Iraq at various rallies. Newspaper editorials have also repeatedly called on countries around the world to recognize this new government supported by the people. Therefore, with the support of the Indian people, the Indian government, disregarding external pressure, decided to grant diplomatic recognition to the Republic of Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 24th. To oppose the aggression of US and British imperialism in the Middle East and strive for a negative vote in the October 5th referendum, tens of thousands of Parisians responded to the call of the French Communist Party and attended a mass rally at the Winter Velodrome last night. The participants unanimously passed a resolution condemning the US and British aggression against Middle Eastern countries, condemning the French government's support of US-British aggression, allowing American planes and warships to use French bases for stopovers, and sending several French warships to the Mediterranean.
    The resolution said: Parisians are fully aware that the new military adventure in the Middle East threatens the world with a terrible atomic war. Parisians believe that the attitude taken by France in such a serious situation cannot be decided by one person or a few ministers who are not supervised by parliamentarians.
    Therefore, the resolution demands the convening of the National Assembly to make decisions that are in the interests of France and peace.
    The conference was chaired by Raymond Guyot, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party. Several speakers were warmly applauded by the crowd, who shouted "No Pasarán" and "No to De Gaulle."
    FCP Secretary Jacques Duclos, referring to De Gaulle's draft constitution, pointed out its anti-democratic and reactionary nature. He also pointed out that the draft constitution of personal dictatorship is based on the Pétain constitution.
    Duclos said loudly amidst applause that the first thing to consider today is to launch a vigorous movement to ensure that France says no to dictatorship and no to fascism. This means striving for victory in the referendum struggle.
    Duclos said that France can only have a great future if it maintains its independence, refuses to join aggressive blocs, refuses to participate in the arms race, and continues to pursue a policy of friendship with all peoples.
    Duclos concluded by saying that in order to restore France's status as an independent power, France should avoid the double burden of colonial wars and the arms race.
    FCP Central Committee member Jeannette Vermeersch condemned the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in the Middle East in her speech. She said: The era of national and colonial oppression, the era of fascism, is gone forever. The people of all countries hope to live a free life and hope to develop their land and wealth to seek the happiness of their descendants and the prosperity of their country. She said that the people of all countries who yearn for peace, friendship, peaceful labor, and happiness will fight together to demand an end to the aggression against the Lebanese people, to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Middle East, to abolish military bases in France, to stop the Algerian War, and to strive for disarmament and peaceful coexistence.

    抗议美英武装干涉中东
    印度加尔各答十五万学生罢课
    巴黎数万市民集会谴责政府支持美英侵略
    新华社新德里24日电　印度各界人民坚决表示支持新赢得独立的伊拉克人民。在詹谢普尔钢城和腊尼甘季煤城的工人以及孟买的海员都举行了集会和示威游行。在加尔各答，十五万学生举行了罢课。在全国其他各地也普遍举行火炬游行，人们一致谴责美英帝国主义武装侵略中东国家的行为，并且欢呼伊拉克共和国的诞生和表示支持伊拉克人民保卫独立的斗争。印度共产党、人民社会党和国大党的议员们在各种集会上也纷纷揭露美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的罪行和帝国主义者打算扼杀伊拉克共和国的企图。各报社论也一再号召全世界各国承认这个人民支持的新政府。因此，印度政府在印度人民的支持下，不顾外界的压力，在伊拉克共和国政府请求后决定给予它以外交上的承认。
    新华社巴黎24日电　为了反对美英帝国主义在中东的侵略，争取在10月5日举行公民投票时表示否定态度，数万巴黎市民响应法国共产党的号召，昨晚参加了在冬季赛球场举行的群众大会。与会者一致通过决议，谴责美英侵略中东国家，谴责法国政府支持美英的侵略，容许美国飞机和军舰利用法国基地在中途停歇和派遣几艘法国军舰赴地中海。
    决议说：巴黎人充分意识到在中东进行的新的军事冒险使世界遭受到的可怕的原子战争威胁。巴黎人认为法国在这样严重的局势下所采取的态度，不能由不受议员监督的一个人或几个部长来决定。
    因此，决议要求召开国民议会来作出符合法国和和平的利益的决定。
    大会由法国共产党政治局委员雷蒙·居约主持，好几位发言的人都受到群众的热烈鼓掌，群众高呼不让法西斯主义通过，不要戴高乐。
    法共书记雅克·杜克洛在谈到戴高乐宪法草案时指出了它的反民主的反动性质。他还指出，个人独裁宪法草案是以贝当宪法草案为依据的。
    杜克洛在掌声中大声说，今天首先应该考虑的，就是展开有力的运动，争取法国表示不要独裁制，不要法西斯主义。这就是要争取全民投票斗争的胜利。
    杜克洛说，法国只有保持它的独立，拒绝参加侵略集团，拒绝参加军备竞赛，并继续执行同各国人民友好的政策，法国才能有伟大前途。
    杜克洛最后说，为了恢复法国独立的大国地位，法国就应该避免殖民战争和军备竞赛的双重负担。
    法共中央委员让尼特·维美徐在发言中谴责美英两国武装干涉中东。她说：民族和殖民压迫的时代，法西斯主义的时代，已经一去不复返了。各国人民希望过自由的生活，希望开发他们的土地和财富，以谋求他们后代的幸福和国家的繁荣。她说，渴望和平、友谊、和平劳动和幸福的各国人民，将一起进行斗争，要求制止对黎巴嫩人民进行的侵略；要求从中东撤退外国军队，取消在法国的军事基地；制止阿尔及利亚战争；争取裁减军备和和平共处。
