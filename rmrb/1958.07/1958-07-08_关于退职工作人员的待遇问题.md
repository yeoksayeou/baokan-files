    On the Treatment of Retired Staff
    Question: How should seniority and retirement benefits be calculated for veterans who transfer to civilian work and then retire?
    Answer: If veterans who transfer to civilian work and then retire have already received subsidies at the time of their transfer or demobilization from the military, their time in the military can be counted towards their years of service, but no additional retirement subsidies will be issued. Furthermore, the time spent demobilized and returning home is not counted as general or continuous seniority.
    If military cadres are admitted to schools for study and then take up work after graduation, their study period cannot be counted as seniority.
    Question: Can retired staff continue to enjoy public medical care benefits?
    Answer: Retired staff cannot continue to enjoy public medical care benefits. If they have genuine difficulties with medical expenses, they can apply for social relief from the local People's Committee's civil affairs department.
    Question: Can retired personnel participate in work or study again after returning home?
    Answer: If the local government needs staff, they can re-employ retired personnel to work again. Retired personnel can also apply to factory or enterprise-run short-term training courses.

    关于退职工作人员的待遇问题
    问：转业或复员军人到地方工作后，如果再退职，应如何计算工龄和退职金？
    答：军队转业或复员干部到地方工作后，再退职，如果在军队转业或复员时已经领过补助金的，原在军队工作的时间可以计算工作年限，但不得再计发退职补助费。同时复员回家的时间，也不算一般工龄和连续工龄。
    军队干部考入学校学习毕业后又参加工作时，其学习期间不能计算工龄。
    问：工作人员退职后能不能享受公费医疗待遇？
    答：工作人员退职后，就不能继续享受公费医疗待遇。如果医药费确实有困难，可向当地人民委员会的民政部门申请社会救济。
    问：退职人员回家后能否再参加工作或学习？
    答：退职人员回家后，当地政府如果需要工作人员，可以吸收他们再参加工作，退职人员也可以投考工厂、企业开办的短期训练班。	  国务院人事局    人民来信组
