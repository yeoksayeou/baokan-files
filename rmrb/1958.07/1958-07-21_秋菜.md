Data

　　China has superior natural conditions and cultivates many kinds of vegetables. The main vegetable varieties cultivated in most areas include: Chinese cabbage, radish, mustard greens, Chinese leek, scallions, garlic, pumpkin, cucumber, green beans, peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, cabbage, spinach, etc.

　　Among these vegetables, Chinese cabbage, radish, mustard greens, turnip, spinach, etc., can all be sown in autumn and harvested before winter. The autumn vegetables in the north usually refer to these vegetables. Northern autumn vegetables can be planted in gardens or in fields.

　　Many areas in the lower reaches of the Yellow River are major production areas for Chinese cabbage, a major autumn vegetable variety. Last year, Shandong Province alone planted 270,000 mu of Chinese cabbage, with a total output of over 2 billion jin. Shandong Jiaoxian large-leaf cabbage, small-leaf cabbage, Zhifu cabbage, Hebei Xushui County's "Walnut Pattern," Hebei Tangshan's Hetou cabbage, Beijing's "Da Qingkou," "Qing Baikou," Tianjin's "Qing Maye," etc., are all relatively prominent excellent varieties in this area. These improved varieties of Chinese cabbage are not only firm in head, tender in texture, but also highly storable, generally able to be stored in cellars for four to six months.

　　Radishes are also commonly planted among autumn vegetables. Radishes can be used as vegetables, or made into pickles and preserved vegetables. Some varieties ("Xin Li Mei," "Wei Qing," etc.) can also be used as substitutes for fruits.

    秋菜
    我国自然条件优越，栽培的蔬菜种类很多。多数地区栽培的主要蔬菜品种有：白菜、萝卜、芥菜、韭菜、大葱、大蒜、南瓜、黄瓜、四季豆、辣椒、茄子、西红柿、甘兰、菠菜等。
    这些蔬菜当中的白菜、萝卜、芥菜、蔓菁、菠菜等都可以在秋季播种，冬前收获，通常说的北方秋菜就是指的这些蔬菜。北方秋菜可以在园田里栽种，也可以在大田里栽种。
    黄河下游许多地区是秋菜主要品种白菜的产区。山东省去年就播种了二十七万亩白菜，总产量在二十亿斤以上。山东胶县大叶菜、小叶菜、芝罘白菜，河北徐水县的“核桃纹”，河北唐山的河头白菜，北京的“大青口”、“青白口”，天津的“青麻叶”等，都是这一带比较突出的优良品种。这些良种白菜，不但结球坚实、菜质细嫩，而且耐储性强，一般可窖藏四到六个月。
    秋菜中的萝卜种植也较普遍。萝卜可以供做蔬菜，也可以制作咸菜、酱菜，有些品种（“心里美”“卫青”等）还可以作水果的代用品。
