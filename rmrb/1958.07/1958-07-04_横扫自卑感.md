    Sweeping Away Inferiority Complex
    Wéi Shì

    Pride makes one lag behind, while modesty helps one progress. This is an irrefutable truth. Pride leads to arrogance, subjectivity, one-sidedness, and detachment from the masses; complacency leads to conservatism and a lack of desire for progress. Humble people understand that objective reality is constantly developing, and today's new level will become yesterday's old level if not continuously improved. Therefore, whether one is proud or humble can generally be proven by whether one lags behind or progresses, whether one hinders or promotes society.

    We advocate modesty and strongly oppose pride. However, we want genuine modesty, a modesty based on facts, not false or vulgar modesty. China has a population of over 600 million, and is temporarily behind in terms of economy and culture. We acknowledge that China is a large country in terms of population but a small country in terms of industry. This is genuine modesty, modesty that conforms to the actual situation; this kind of modesty is motivating every one of our 600 million people to work together to transform our motherland from a small industrial country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Only in this way can we live up to the unique advantage of our large population. In fact, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, are not China's 600 million people surpassing one capitalist country after another, not only in terms of the level of political consciousness, but also in terms of the speed of economic and cultural development? If we cannot see the great strength of our 600 million people, and believe that we cannot catch up with foreign countries, and can only live in a small industrial country for our whole lives, even for generations to come, then that is self-deprecation and succumbing to an inferiority complex.

    After the decisive victory of the socialist revolution, and amidst the vigorous development of socialist construction, the liberated masses, with their heroic spirit of transforming the country, are sweeping away all kinds of superstition, fear, and inferiority complexes. Superstition, fear, and inferiority—feeling shorter than others, feeling like one can only follow in others' footsteps—these are traces left in the mental state of many people by over a century of oppression by foreign invaders and thousands of years of feudal shackles. This spiritual constraint must be completely removed in order to cultivate a large number of people who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to innovate and create, and dare to uphold the truth.

    Those who have not been released, or have not been thoroughly released, from spiritual constraints are always hesitant and lack courage. Consequently, they cannot stand up, dare not think what no one has thought, dare not say what no one has said, dare not do what no one has done. Therefore, even good things are seen as rigid rules by them. Modesty is inherently a virtue, but in the minds of those who are spiritually constrained, it is often vulgarized. They pay attention to the appearance of modesty, the demeanor of modesty, as they would pay attention to clothing, without asking about the essence or the role of modesty. They do not think about the problems they should think about, do not say the words they should say, do not do the things they should do, do not distinguish right from wrong, and do not plant the red flags they should plant. Therefore, they would rather be intellectual sluggards than think independently; "Only speak three-tenths of your mind to others, never reveal your whole heart"; they fear the tiger in front and the wolf behind, and dare not charge into battle for the truth. They reduce modesty to a low level of interest, and commit a major error: they lose their revolutionary ambition and courage.

    Having ambition, courage, and self-confidence is not pride; superstition, fear, and inferiority are not modesty. Between self-confidence and pride, between inferiority and modesty, there is a world of difference. Self-confidence and modesty are well-founded and based on facts; while pride and inferiority arise from overestimating or underestimating oneself. We will complete the "National Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule, and we will catch up with and surpass England in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years or less. This is confidence, not pride; this confidence is built on the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. This general line is the result of the practical experience of the people's struggle over many years and the development of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought. If we cannot see the broad prospects opened up by the application and development of the Party's mass line in socialist construction, if we underestimate the leap in social productive forces driven by the victory of the socialist revolution and the spiritual liberation of the people in such a large country as ours, if we dare not imagine greatly increasing the speed of construction, if we dare not propose measures to catch up with and surpass foreign countries, then that is not modesty, but inferiority.

    People with an inferiority complex are always afraid of this and that. Unless we eliminate all kinds of lingering spiritual fears, we cannot eradicate the root of the inferiority complex. In the past, China's economy and culture were relatively backward, so some people were afraid of comparing with foreign countries, seeing the world level as a star in the sky that China could never reach. In fact, one need not go far back into our five thousand years of history; just take the fact that in the past winter and this spring, the country expanded its irrigated area by 350 million mu. Isn't its scale and speed at the world level? In the past, there were relatively few people who read books in our country, so some people were afraid of those who read more books, some people were afraid of reading, as if only professors, experts, and authorities could understand books, have knowledge, and create inventions. In fact, as long as one is willing to squeeze out time to read, there is no abstruse book that cannot be understood; moreover, people with practical work experience benefit much more from reading, due to the combination of rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge, than those who make reading their profession. Recently, thousands of new-style agricultural tools and transportation equipment have appeared in rural areas across the country. Their creators and inventors are not professors, experts, or authorities; the vast majority are farmers who have not read many books. Doesn't this perfectly prove that uneducated people need not fear learned people? In the past, China's science and industry were underdeveloped, so some people were afraid of science and industry, as if they were something profoundly mysterious. However, after applying the Party's mass line in the scientific and industrial sectors, they have become things that can be freely mastered and developed at high speed.

    Inferiority complexes come in all shapes and sizes and are deeply rooted, but if we find the source of spiritual fear and prescribe the right medicine, it is not difficult to uproot them. People with an inferiority complex fear this and that, simply because they are: concerned about personal gains and losses; cannot see or underestimate the power of the masses; ideologically rigid, sticking to conventions, and not understanding the principle of the unity of opposites in the development of objective things.

    The reason why truth has irresistible power is because it reflects the development of objective reality, and also because revolutionary patriots are not afraid to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives, guiding the masses to fight for its realization. They are willing to be shattered to pieces for the sake of truth, they do not care about personal gains and losses, they are fearless, and therefore they will not develop an inferiority complex. Being fearless and without an inferiority complex allows one to persistently and courageously engage in the battle of planting red flags. There are some who dare not be the first in the world, who dare not speak until the difficult problems are about to be solved, who dare not take a step until the thorns on the road have been cleared away. Their appearance is very steady, but their hearts are very timid and inferior. Such people value personal gains and losses, and take the gains and losses of truth lightly. What they plant are gray flags, not red flags.

    Another important reason for not daring to be confident is that, as a grain of soil of the earth, as a drop of water of the sea, they are disconnected from their source, they cannot see or underestimate the power of the earth and the sea—the masses of the people. Didn't the emergence of conservative ideas in 1957 against the so-called "rash advance" occur precisely because they could not see or underestimated the infinite power latent in our 600 million people, and doubted the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results? The facts of the saddle-shaped development on the production front over the past three years have taught many people a lesson, dispelled their doubts, and increased their confidence. The unprecedentedly vigorous, high-spirited, and striving fighting spirit, confidence, and drive displayed by the masses now leaves no place to hide for unhealthy mental states such as doubt, fear, shrinking back, and inferiority complexes. The great leap forward in agricultural production, the widespread blooming of local industries, and the large-scale development of people-run schools have shattered the various pessimistic views and inferiority complexes that arose from seeing things but not people. Under the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the communist spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do is developing more vigorously throughout the country. However, if we do not appreciate the wisdom and strength of the masses, then, when we encounter specific difficulties and twists and turns, we will still generate doubts and inferiority complexes. Take local industry, for example; after solving difficulties such as funding, factory buildings, and workers, difficulties such as raw materials, sales, and collaboration will arise again. Many difficulties can be easily solved as long as we follow the mass line. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In addition to the leadership of the Party, a decisive factor is the six hundred million people. With more people, there are more discussions, the enthusiasm is higher, and the drive is greater." This is once again teaching us: believe in the masses and rely on the masses.

    There are different views on China's large population and its poverty and blankness. People with an inferiority complex derive from this the pessimistic view that too many people are not good and that China is too backward and difficult to move forward quickly. Comrade Mao Zedong, with a dialectical materialist analysis, pointed out that China's six hundred million people being poor and blank may seem like a bad thing, but it is actually a good thing: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire to work, the desire for revolution. A blank sheet of paper, with no burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and good for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." This dialectical analysis inspires the whole Party and the people of the whole country to carry out continuous revolution, to build the newest and most beautiful socialist country, and to create the newest and most beautiful communist style. People with an inferiority complex see things as fixed and unchanging, looking at the new China with old eyes; dialectical materialists believe that things will always move towards their opposite, that old things will always be replaced by new things, and that the latter will always surpass the former. In the old China, it was common for flies to compete with people for food; after the campaign to eliminate the four pests, flies are now almost invisible in China, which is a miracle in the eyes of foreigners. The old China was seen as a sheet of loose sand at the mercy of foreign invaders; but now, after the constant revolutionary training, the Chinese people, with the Communist Party as the core, have formed a solid rock. Even the enemies cannot deny the unity and awakening of the Chinese people.

    The situation of leap forward after leap forward is sweeping away all kinds of superstition, fear, and inferiority complexes. The Party calls on us to promote the completion of this sweeping work and to quickly break with these decadent mental states. Things will always move towards their opposite; the mental state of superstition, fear, and inferiority complexes will inevitably be replaced by a lofty communist style of believing in the truth, relying on the masses, and being fearless of any authority.

    横扫自卑感
    唯是
    骄傲使人落后，虚心使人进步，这是颠扑不破的真理。骄傲了，便会头脑发胀，主观片面，妄自尊大，脱离群众；自满保守，不求进步。谦虚的人却知道：客观存在是不断地发展的，今天所达到的新水平，如果不加以提高，到明天就会变成旧水平。所以，是骄傲还是谦虚，这一般可以从落后了还是进步了，从对社会起了促退作用还是促进作用，得到反证。
    我们提倡谦虚，力戒骄傲。但是，我们要的是真谦虚、实事求是的谦虚，可不是假谦虚、庸俗的谦虚。我国有六亿多人口，在经济和文化方面暂时还落后。我们承认我国在人口上是大国，在工业上还是小国。这是真谦虚、合乎实际情况的谦虚；这种谦虚正在激励我们六亿多人口的每一个，同心协力，把祖国从工业小国改变成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，这样才不辜负我国人口众多这个得天独厚的特点。事实上，我国六亿多人民，在共产党的正确领导之下，不仅在政治觉悟的水平方面，而且在经济和文化发展的速度方面，不是正在把资本主义国家一个又一个地抛到后面去了吗？如果我们看不见六亿多人口的伟大力量，以为我们赶不上外国，只能一辈子，甚至子子孙孙住在工业小国里，那就是妄自菲薄，失于自卑了。
    在社会主义革命已获得决定性的胜利之后，在社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展的形势之下，解放了的广大人民改变祖国面貌的那种移山倒海的英雄气魄，正在横扫种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感。迷信、恐惧、自卑，似乎比别人矮了一个头、似乎只能跟在别人的屁股后面，这是一百多年外国侵略者的压迫和几千年封建枷锁遗留在不少人的精神状态中的痕迹。必须彻底解除这种精神束缚，才能成长出大批敢想敢说敢做，敢于革新创造，敢于坚持真理的人来。
    没有解除或者没有彻底解除精神束缚的人，总是顾虑重重，勇气不足，因而站不起来，不敢想没有人想过的，不敢说没有人说过的，不敢做没有人做过的事。因此，纵使是好事，也会被他们看成清规戒律。谦虚本来是美德，但是落到精神有束缚的人的脑子里，往往被庸俗化了。他们像讲究服装那样讲究谦虚的仪表、谦虚的风度，而不问谦虚的实质、谦虚的作用。他们该想的问题不想，该说的话不说，该做的事不做，该辨的是非不辨，该插的红旗不插。因此，他们宁为思想懒汉，不愿独立思考；“逢人只说三分话，未可全抛一片心”；前怕虎、后怕狼，不敢为真理冲锋陷阵。他们把谦虚低级趣味化了，而且犯了一个最大的错误：他们丧失了革命的志气和勇气。
    有志气、勇敢、自信心，这不是骄傲，迷信、恐惧、自卑感，这不是谦虚。自信与骄傲，自卑与谦虚，两者之间，差之毫厘、失之千里。自信和谦虚，是有根有据，实事求是的；而骄傲和自卑，则由于看高或看低，估高或估低了自己。我们将提前完成“全国农业发展纲要”，我们将在十五年或者更短的时间内在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国，这是自信而不是骄傲；这种自信，是建立在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的基础上的，而这条总路线是多年来人民斗争的实际经验和毛泽东同志的思想的发展的结果。要是看不见由于党的群众路线在社会主义建设事业中的应用和发展所开辟的广阔天地，要是低估了在我们这样大国内由于社会主义革命胜利和人们的精神解放所推动的社会生产力的跃进，该设想而不敢设想大大提高建设速度，该提出而不敢提出赶上和超过外国的措施，那便不是谦虚而是自卑了。
    有自卑感的人总是怕这怕那。不消除精神上残存的各种各样恐惧，就不能铲掉自卑感的根。我国过去经济和文化比较落后，因此有人怕比外国，把世界水平看成中国永远不能摘到的天上星星。其实，不必远搬五千年的历史，就拿去冬今春半年间全国扩大了灌溉面积三亿五千万亩这一件事来说，它的规模和速度难道不是世界水平？我国过去读书的人比较少，因此有人怕多读几本书的人，有人怕读书，好像只有教授、专家、权威才能读通书，才有学问，才能创造发明。其实，只要肯挤出时间读书，没有什么读不通的天书；而且，有实际工作经验的人，由于理性知识和感性知识相结合，读起书来，比以读书为业的人收效大得多。最近在全国各地农村中出现了数以千计的新式农具和运输工具，它们的创造发明者，不是什么教授、专家、权威，绝大多数是没有读过什么书的农民，这不正好证明没有文化的人不必怕有学问的人么？我国过去科学和工业不发达，因此有人怕科学和工业，似乎它们是什么高深莫测的神秘东西。然而，在科学和工业部门中运用党的群众路线以后，它们便成为可以自由地掌握和高速度发展的东西了。
    自卑感形形色色，根深蒂固，但是如果找到精神恐惧的来源，对症下药，自卑感是不难连根拔掉的。有自卑感的人怕这怕那，无非是由于：计较个人得失；看不见或者低估了人民群众的力量；思想僵化，墨守成规，没有领会客观事物按照对立统一规律发展的道理。
    真理之所以有不可抵挡的力量，是因为它反映客观存在的发展，还因为有革命志士不怕掷头颅、洒鲜血，引导广大群众，为它的实现而奋斗。他们甘愿为真理粉身碎骨，他们不计较个人得失，无所畏惧，因而也不会发生自卑感。无所畏惧，没有自卑感，才能坚持不懈地、勇气充沛地进行插红旗的战斗。有一种不敢为天下先的人，非到疑难的问题将近解决时候不敢发言，非到道路上的荆棘被披除之后不敢举步，外表很稳重，内心很怯懦、自卑。这种人以个人的得失为重，以真理的得失为轻，所插的是灰旗而不是红旗。
    不敢自信的另一个重要原因是：身为大地的一粒土，身为大海的一滴水，但脱离了本源，看不见或者低估了大地、大海——人民群众的力量。1957年反对所谓“冒进”的保守思想的出现，不就是因为看不见或者低估了六亿多人口所潜存的无穷力量，而对多快好省的建设方针发生了怀疑么？三年来生产战线上马鞍形发展的事实，使许多人得到了教训，打消了疑虑，提高了信心。现在人民群众所表现的空前旺盛、高昂、奋发的斗志、信心、干劲，使怀疑、恐惧、畏缩、自卑感等等不健康的精神状态没有藏身之地。农业生产的大跃进，地方工业的遍地开花，民办学校的大量发展，打破了由于见物不见人而产生的种种悲观论调和自卑心理。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的照耀下，敢想敢说敢做的共产主义精神在全国更加蓬勃发展。但是，如果不体会人民群众的智慧和力量，那么，在遇到具体的困难和波折的时候，仍然会产生怀疑和自卑感的。拿地方工业来说，在解决了资金、厂房、工人等等困难之后，又会发生原料、销路、协作等等困难。许多困难，只要走群众路线就能迎刃而解。毛泽东同志说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”这就是再一次教导我们：相信人民群众，依靠人民群众。
    对于中国人口多、又穷又白，是有不同的看法的。有自卑感的人从这里得出了人太多不好和中国太落后了、难于迅速前进的悲观论。毛泽东同志则以辩证唯物论的分析，指出中国六亿人口的一穷二白看起来是坏事，其实是好事：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”这个辩证的分析，鼓舞全党、全国人民去进行不断革命，去建设最新最美的社会主义国家，去创造最新最美的共产主义风格。有自卑感的人把事物看成固定不变，以旧的眼光看新的中国；辩证唯物论者则认为事物总要走向它的反面，旧的东西总要被新的东西所代替，后来总要居上。在旧中国，苍蝇与人争食是常见的现象；经过除四害运动，现在在中国几乎不见苍蝇的踪迹，这在外国人的眼里是一个奇迹。旧中国被看做任凭外国侵略者宰割的一盘散沙；而现在，中国人民经过不断革命的锻炼，以共产党为核心，结成坚固的磐石，中国人民的团结和觉悟，连敌人也无法否认了。
    跃进再跃进的形势在横扫形形色色的迷信、恐惧、自卑感。党号召我们促进这个扫荡工作的完成，迅速同这些腐朽的精神状态决裂。事物总要走向它的反面，迷信、恐惧、自卑感的精神状态，必将为相信真理、依靠群众、对任何权威都无所畏惧的崇高的共产主义风格所代替。
