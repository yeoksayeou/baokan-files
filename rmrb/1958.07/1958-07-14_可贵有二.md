Editorial Remarks:

Two Valuable Things

It is truly encouraging to read the news from Quxi County.

This county was originally a backward county (see page 4 of this newspaper on the 11th). However, by adopting the method of combining rectification campaigns in government offices with rectification campaigns in rural areas, combining mass rectification with the implementation of the general line, it quickly shed its backward label. This once again illustrates that no matter how backward a region may be, as long as it strengthens ideological and political work and gives play to subjective initiative, it can catch up from behind. This is one valuable thing.

The second valuable thing is that this county does not become intoxicated with its existing achievements. On the basis of summarizing its experience, it has concretized the methods of rectification and formed them into a system, using it to regularly cleanse all aspects of filth and promote daily work.

This system is a relatively complete one. From cadres to the masses, from government offices to families, they all restrain and promote each other. It is conceivable that if Quxi County persists in adopting this system, a newer outlook will surely emerge.

    可贵有二
    读了曲溪县的新闻，实在令人鼓舞。
    这个县，本来是个落后县（见本报11日四版）。但由于采取了机关整风和农村整风、全民整风和贯彻总路线相结合的办法，便迅速摘了落后的帽子。这，再次说明了不管是怎么样落后的地区，只要是加强了思想和政治工作，发挥了主观能动性，后来是可以居上的。这是可贵之一。
    可贵之二是，这个县并不沉醉于已有的成就，在总结经验的基础上，把整风的方法具体化了起来，并把它形成了一种制度，运用它来经常洗刷各方面的污垢，推动日常工作。
    这种制度，是一套比较完整的制度，从干部到群众，从机关到家庭，都相互制约，相互推动。可以想像，曲溪县坚持采用这一制度的结果，必将会出现更新的面貌。
