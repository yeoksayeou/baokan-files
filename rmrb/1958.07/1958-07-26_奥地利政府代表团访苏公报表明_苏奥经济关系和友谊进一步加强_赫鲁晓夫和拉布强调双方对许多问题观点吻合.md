Xinhua News Agency, July 25th dispatch from Moscow: The Moscow newspapers today published the communique on the visit of the Austrian government delegation to the Soviet Union.

The communique points out that the Austrian delegation held talks with the Soviet government leaders during its visit to the Soviet Union. During the talks, the two sides first carefully discussed the state of economic relations between the two countries. Both sides believe that the work of providing oil is being implemented on schedule without any hindrance, in accordance with the Soviet-Austrian Agreement of July 12, 1955. The Austrian government delegation requested the Soviet government to reduce the remaining portion of oil (7 million tons) that it should provide to the Soviet Union. Based on the friendly relations between the two countries and the wishes of the Austrian government, the Soviet government agreed to reduce it by half. However, considering that the Soviet Union has long-term obligations to provide Austrian oil to third countries, the two sides agreed that the Soviet Union will provide a total of 3.5 million tons of oil to Austria from January 1, 1959, from which 500,000 tons will be provided annually to repay half of the 1 million tons of oil that Austria provides to the Soviet Union annually. The two sides entrusted the relevant agencies of the two countries to conclude an agreement to implement this agreement no later than October 1st of this year.

Both sides pointed out that the agreement on Austria's supply of goods to the Soviet Union to compensate for the property transferred by the Soviet Union to Austria under the Austrian State Treaty is being strictly fulfilled. According to the wishes of the Austrian government delegation, the Soviet side expressed its willingness to exchange the 200,000 tons of oil provided annually under the fifth and sixth year commodity lists for other commodities. The Soviet Union also expressed its willingness to expand imports of industrial semi-finished products and finished products from Austria.

Both sides believe that utilizing the Danube River for the transfer of goods and expansion of tourism on a mutually beneficial basis is in the interests of both countries. The Austrian government delegation stated that Austria intends to participate in the Danube River Navigation Convention.

The communique points out that good relations have developed between the Soviet Union and Austria since the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty and the talks held between the Soviet and Austrian government delegations in Moscow in 1955. Both sides agreed that the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty played an important role in easing international tensions. The Austrian delegation stated that the Austrian government will continue to develop friendly relations with countries in the East and West on the basis of Austria's independence and neutrality.

The two sides also discussed some international issues during the talks, especially the situation in the Middle East. The Soviet delegation expressed its determination to promote the easing of tensions in the Middle East. The Austrian delegation stated that it is very concerned about easing the tension in this region. The communique stated that Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, intends to invite Austrian Federal President Schärf to pay an official visit to the Soviet Union. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev accepted the invitation of Federal Chancellor Raab and Vice-Chancellor Pittermann to visit Austria at an appropriate time.

The Austrian government delegation headed by Chancellor Raab arrived in Moscow on July 21. The delegation left the Soviet capital on the evening of the 24th to visit Leningrad.

Xinhua News Agency, July 25th dispatch from Moscow: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev held a reception at the Moscow Kremlin on the 24th to entertain the Austrian government delegation headed by Chancellor Raab.

Khrushchev spoke at the reception. He pointed out that the communique on the visit of the Austrian government delegation to the Soviet Union, which was published on the same day, shows that the friendship and mutual trust between the Soviet Union and Austria have been further strengthened. During the talks, the two sides agreed on many important issues related to Soviet-Austrian relations and the international situation.

Khrushchev said that the current international situation is worrying. The Soviet Union, which has always pursued a peaceful policy, is working with other peace-loving countries to spare no effort in preventing the outbreak of a new war. We are deeply convinced that as long as the people of all countries actively oppose the instigation of a new war, they will certainly be able to defend the cause of peace. The forces of peace have developed and consolidated, and it already has the ability to stop any aggressor and prevent war. However, this is not easy, because there are still many crazy guys who not only look forward to a new war, but also are preparing to launch a new war. Therefore, the people of all countries should be vigilant.

Then, Raab gave a reply speech. He said that the friendly talks held in Moscow also showed that Austria and the Soviet Union agreed on many points of view. He expressed his gratitude for the sympathy shown by the Soviet side in studying the Austrian delegation's "special wishes" during the talks.

Raab said that Austria also hopes to contribute to ensuring and maintaining world peace, although the Republic of Austria's strength in this area is limited.

    奥地利政府代表团访苏公报表明
    苏奥经济关系和友谊进一步加强
    赫鲁晓夫和拉布强调双方对许多问题观点吻合
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报今天发表了关于奥地利政府代表团访问苏联的公报。
    公报指出，奥地利代表团访问苏联期间曾经同苏联政府领导人举行了会谈。会谈中，双方首先仔细讨论了两国经济关系状况的问题。双方认为，根据1955年7月12日苏奥协定，提供石油的工作正在毫无任何阻挠地按期实施。奥地利政府代表团请求苏联政府减少它应当向苏联提供的其余一部分石油（七百万吨）。苏联政府根据两国的友好关系和奥地利政府的愿望，同意减少一半，然而，考虑到苏联承担有向第三方面国家提供奥地利石油的长期义务，双方议定，苏联从1959年1月1日起总共向奥地利提供三百五十万吨石油，从中每年提供五十万吨，以偿付奥地利每年向苏联提供的一百万吨石油的一半。双方委托两国有关机构至迟在今年10月1日缔结实现这个协议的协定。
    双方指出，关于奥地利向苏联供应商品以偿付苏联根据奥地利国家条约移交给奥地利的财产的协定，正在严格履行。根据奥地利政府代表团的希望，苏联方面表示愿意把上述协定根据第五年和第六年商品货单所规定的每年提供的二十万吨石油换成其他商品。苏联还表示愿意扩大从奥地利进口工业半制品和成品。
    双方认为，在互利的情况下利用多瑙河来转运货物和扩大旅行事业是符合两国利益的。奥地利政府代表团声明，奥地利打算参加多瑙河航行公约。
    公报指出，缔结奥地利国家条约以及1955年苏联和奥地利两国政府代表团在莫斯科举行会谈以后，苏、奥两国之间发展了良好关系。双方一致认为，奥地利国家条约的缔结在缓和国际紧张局势方面起了重要作用。奥地利代表团表示，奥地利政府今后仍将在奥地利的独立和中立的基础上发展同东西方各国的友好关系。
    双方在会谈中还谈到了一些国际问题，特别是中近东局势问题。苏联代表团表示，决心促进中近东紧张局势的缓和。奥地利代表团表示，它十分关心缓和这个地区的紧张局势。公报中说，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫打算邀请奥地利联邦总统谢尔夫到苏联作正式访问。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫接受了联邦总理拉布和副总理皮特曼的邀请，将在适当时候访问奥地利。
    以拉布总理为首的奥地利政府代表团是7月21日到莫斯科的。代表团已经于24日晚间离开苏联首都前往列宁格勒访问。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫24日在莫斯科克里姆林宫举行招待会，招待以拉布总理为首的奥地利政府代表团。
    赫鲁晓夫在招待会上讲了话。他指出，当天发表的关于奥地利政府代表团访问苏联的公报表明，苏、奥两国的友谊和互相信任有了进一步的加强。在会谈中，双方对所讨论的许多有关苏奥关系和国际局势的重要问题的看法是吻合的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在的国际局势令人不安。一贯奉行和平政策的苏联同其他爱好和平的国家一道不遗余力地在防止爆发新战争。我们深信，只要各国人民积极地反对挑起新战争，他们就一定能捍卫住和平的事业。和平力量发展和巩固了，它已经有能力制止任何侵略者和防止战争。但是，这也不是轻而易举的事，因为，还有许多疯狂的家伙不仅盼望新战争，而且还准备发动新战争。因此，各国人民应当保持警惕。
    接着，拉布致答词。他说，在莫斯科举行的友好谈判也表明，奥苏两国在许多方面的观点是吻合的。他对会谈中苏联方面在研究奥地利代表团的“特别愿望”时所表现的同情表示感谢。
    拉布说，奥地利也希望对保障和维护世界和平作出贡献，虽然奥地利共和国在这方面的力量有限。
