Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 24th. King Hussein of Jordan, knowing that the fate of his small court is precarious, has requested his American and British masters to allow him to flee abroad to save his life. According to a "News" correspondent in London, King Hussein of Jordan summoned the American and British ambassadors to Jordan and asked them to inform their governments that he was not confident in the domestic situation and therefore believed that he should abdicate and take refuge abroad. According to the reporter, "the ambassadors were surprised by this conversation" and "advised the king to abandon this idea."

The report said that King Hussein "promised the ambassadors that he would not take any steps in this regard until he received the opinions of the American and British governments on this issue."

At the same time, Hussein hurriedly begged the United States once again to send troops to "protect" him.

According to reports, Hussein told a Columbia Broadcasting System reporter on the 23rd that he had requested that American troops come to Jordan to join the British troops already in Jordan. He said he had received assurances from Washington that the United States would send troops to Jordan if needed. He said anxiously that he hoped the American troops would come quickly.

    迫于约旦人民日益强烈的反对
    传约旦国王准备逃命
    新华社开罗24日电　约旦国王侯赛因自知他那个小朝庭的命运朝不保夕，曾经向他的美英主子要求允许他逃往国外保命。据“消息报”驻伦敦记者报道，约旦国王侯赛因召见了美国和英国驻约旦大使，请他们转告他们的政府：他对国内的局势没有把握，因此他认为自己应该逊位并且避居国外。据记者报道，“大使们对这番谈话感到惊讶”，并且“劝告国王放弃这个想法”。
    报道中说，侯赛因国王“答应大使们在他没有接到美英两国政府对这个问题的意见时，他不在这方面采取任何步骤。”
    同时，侯赛因慌忙再一次哀求美国赶紧派兵“保驾”。
    据报道，侯赛因在23日对哥伦比亚广播公司记者说，他要求美国军队到约旦来同已经在约旦的英国军队在一起。他说，他已经从华盛顿获得保证：如果需要的话美国将派军队来约旦。他惶恐不安地说，他希望美国军队赶紧来。
