    An Idea
    Zhou Fang
    After reading Comrade Guo Moruo's new work – "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," serialized in the People's Daily, I had an idea: Since the Party Central Committee proposed catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years or less, our working class has been working with soaring enthusiasm and has already created many miracles, and many new products that have caught up with and surpassed Britain have emerged! Of course, more and better ones will emerge in the future! In order to commend and record these advanced individuals and their deeds, could our poets and writers, like Guo Lao, write "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" based on the names of the new products (of course, with the addition of the creators)! First of all, I still hope Guo Lao will write it! If more poets and writers write, that would be even better.
    May the "hundred flowers" of better and more beautiful industrial products "bloom" soon!

    一个想法
    周方
    读完了人民日报连载的郭沫若同志的新作——“百花齐放”，引起了我一个想法：自从党中央提出十五年或者更短的时间内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国以来，我国工人阶级的干劲冲天，已经创造出很多奇迹，出现了很多赶上和超过英国的新产品！今后当然会出现得更多更好！为了表彰和记录这些先进人物和事迹，我们的诗人、作家能不能也像郭老这样，依据新产品的名称（当然可以加上创造者），也写它个“百花齐放”！首先我当然还是希望郭老来写！如果，有更多的诗人、作家来写，那更好。
    愿更好更美的工业产品的“百花”，早日“齐放”出来！
