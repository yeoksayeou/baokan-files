Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 20th: The Polish government issued a statement on the 19th condemning the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in the Middle East, demanding that US and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, and abandon their policy of exerting military pressure on Arab countries and interfering in their internal affairs.

The statement hopes that the United Nations Organization will take effective action to stop the military actions taken by the United States and Britain in the Middle East that threaten world peace.

According to the Polish Press Agency on the 19th, the Polish Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Naszkowski, told the US Ambassador to Poland that the Polish government demanded that the US government immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 19th: The Czechoslovak government issued a statement on the 19th, firmly condemning the British government's aggression against Jordan, and resolutely demanded that the US government and the British government withdraw all their troops from the territories of Lebanon and Jordan, and stop their provocative preparations for invading Iraq. The statement believes that the armed intervention by the US government and the British government has the danger of causing extremely serious consequences for world peace. The US government and the British government should finally realize that the people of Arab countries are determined to eliminate all remnants of imperialist rule in one fell swoop. All attempts to stop the struggle of millions of people in formerly oppressed colonial countries are doomed to failure.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 19th: Bucharest Radio broadcast on the evening of the 19th a statement by the Romanian government condemning British military aggression in the Middle East.

The statement said that the Romanian government and all the people demanded that the US and British governments stop their armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab Eastern countries and immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The Romanian government and people fully support the Arab people's struggle for freedom and national independence. The statement pointed out that the US and British military aggression against Lebanon and Jordan is part of the entire plan of imperialism to suppress the national liberation movement in Arab countries. The new war adventures of the United States and Britain seriously endanger peace in the Middle East and the world.

The statement emphasized that the United States and the British government should bear full responsibility for their aggressive actions.

In the statement, the Romanian government believes that the only way to solve the Middle East problem is to respect the Arab people's inviolable right to strive for freedom and independence. At present, the United Nations has the responsibility to take urgent measures to stop the military intervention of the United States and Britain against the Arab people and to protect peace and the security of all nations.

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: Kabul News: A spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Afghan government believes that the United Nations General Assembly must convene an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in the Middle East, especially the issue of Lebanon.

The spokesman told a Bakhtar News Agency reporter that events in the Middle East are threatening world peace, and the United Nations should take immediate measures to stop this danger.
