The Chinese government issued a statement on July 16, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon. At the same time, Foreign Minister Chen Yi sent a telegram to Iraqi Foreign Minister al-Jamal, announcing that the Chinese government recognizes the government of the Republic of Iraq. Masses in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou held rallies to oppose American armed intervention in Lebanon and support the Arab people's struggle for national independence.

On July 15, the Soviet representative at the emergency meeting of the Security Council requested that the Security Council promptly order the United States to cease its armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries and immediately withdraw its troops from Lebanon. Subsequently, on the 16th, the Soviet government made the same serious request in its official statement. On the same day, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, sent a telegram to Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem, announcing that the Soviet Union recognizes the government of the Republic of Iraq.

Clearly, stopping the extraordinarily dangerous aggressive actions taken by the United States in the Middle East and supporting the Arab people's anti-intervention struggle has become the most urgent task for the people of the world today. Any country and people that opposes aggression, does not want war, and advocates upholding the United Nations Charter must urgently mobilize to promote the immediate withdrawal of American troops interfering in Lebanon and to safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world.

The American intervention in Lebanon is completely unreasonable. The American aggressors say that they are doing it to protect American expatriates and to maintain Lebanon's territorial integrity and independence. These excuses are completely untenable. If protecting expatriates can become an excuse for sending troops, then any country can take armed intervention actions against another country. The Lebanese people's struggle against the Shamoun traitorous clique is entirely an internal affair of Lebanon, and therefore there is no threat to "territorial integrity and independence." Even the results of the United Nations observer group's investigation in Lebanon could not but admit that there was no so-called "large-scale infiltration" into Lebanon, and the purpose of this observer group was originally to find a basis for American intervention. In this case, Eisenhower himself could not help but raise the question: "Is the stationing of American troops in Lebanon an intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs?" Although Eisenhower replied that it was not, the matter is precisely the opposite of what the American aggressors say. Everyone knows that the Lebanese people's struggle against the Shamoun traitorous clique is precisely to maintain Lebanon's territorial integrity and independence, and it is none other than the American aggressors who are infringing upon Lebanon's independence and sovereignty under the guise of so-called "protecting expatriates" and "maintaining Lebanon's territorial integrity and sovereignty."

This behavior of the American aggressors completely violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." American imperialism, which wants to use the United Nations Charter to cover up its aggressive behavior, is the most blatant violator of the principles of the United Nations Charter.

In a statement issued to justify the invasion of Lebanon, Eisenhower actually cited the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the feudal dynasty as a reason for the American military intervention in Lebanon, and repeatedly attacked the United Arab Republic. The Iraqi people's revolution, like the Lebanese people's armed uprising, is purely an internal affair of each country, and the United States has actually described this purely internal affair as "aggression." As for the imperialists and their lackeys fabricating the nonsense about the United Arab Republic infiltrating Lebanon, even UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld has already denied it. So why is the United States insisting on making a fuss about these topics? The matter is very clear: the American aggression plan is not only aimed at Lebanon, but also at Iraq and the United Arab Republic, and at the people of the entire Middle East. Its arrogant attempt is to strangle national independence movements throughout the Arab East in order to establish an American colonial empire in the Arab world and throughout the Middle East.

Now the broad masses of Arab people have risen up, and world opinion has paid attention to the American aggressive conspiracy. The wolfish ambition of American imperialism can be completely defeated. Everyone remembers that the Anglo-French imperialist attack on Egypt was smashed in this way. But the key here is that all forces in the world that advocate peace and justice must take action and not have any appeasement or tolerance for the aggressive behavior of American imperialism. The US government is now trying its best to make its actions seem like a small matter in order to confuse the world. These lies must not be believed! The situation is extremely serious. If the people of the world and all peace-loving governments take united action, then the United States will have no choice but to withdraw its troops, the independence and freedom of Middle Eastern countries can be guaranteed, and peace in the Middle East and the world can be saved; conversely, if the American aggressors are allowed to do whatever they want, then not only will the people of the Middle East suffer enslavement, but a new world war will be inevitable.

Therefore, for the sake of world peace and for the sake of human justice, people of the world, take urgent action! Stop American intervention in Lebanon and stop American intervention in the entire Middle East situation! American troops, withdraw from Lebanon immediately! No interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon, Iraq, and Arab countries, and no interference in the internal affairs of Asian and African countries!

### 全世界人民行动起来制止美国侵略

    全世界人民行动起来制止美国侵略
    中国政府在7月16日，发表声明，要求美国立即从黎巴嫩撤兵。同时，外交部长陈毅致电伊拉克共和国外交部长阿勒贾迈尔，宣布中国政府承认伊拉克共和国政府。北京、上海、天津、广州等城市群众，纷纷举行集会，反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩，支持阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的斗争。
    在7月15日，苏联代表在安理会紧急会议上要求安理会从速命令美国停止对阿拉伯国家的内部事务进行武装干涉，立即从黎巴嫩撤回它的部队。随后，在16日，苏联政府又在自己的正式声明中提出了同样的严正的要求。在同一天，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫致电伊拉克共和国总理卡塞姆，宣布苏联承认伊拉克共和国政府。
    很明显，制止美国在中东所采取的异常危险的侵略行动，支援阿拉伯人民的反干涉斗争，已经成为全世界人民当前最紧急的任务。任何反对侵略、不要战争和主张维护联合国宪章的国家和人民，都必须紧急动员起来，为促使美国立即撤退干涉黎巴嫩的军队，维护中东和世界的和平而努力。
    美国对黎巴嫩的干涉是毫无道理的。美国侵略者说他们是为了保护美国侨民，为了维护黎巴嫩的领土完整和独立，这种借口是完全不能成立的。如果保护侨民能够成为派兵的借口的话，那么，任何一个国家都可以采取武装干涉别国的行动了。黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙卖国集团的斗争，完全是黎巴嫩内部的事情，因而也根本不存在什么“领土完整和独立”遭受威胁的情况。甚至联合国观察团到黎巴嫩进行调查的结果，也不能不承认没有对黎巴嫩的所谓“大规模渗透”，而这个观察团的目的原来就是为了寻找美国干涉的根据的。在这种情况下，艾森豪威尔自己也无法不提出这样的问题：“美国派遣军驻在黎巴嫩是不是干涉黎巴嫩的内政？”尽管艾森豪威尔答复说不是，但是事情恰恰同美国侵略者所说的相反。尽人皆知，黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙卖国集团的斗争，正是为了维护黎巴嫩的领土完整和独立，而侵犯黎巴嫩的独立和主权的不是别人，正是打着所谓“保护侨民”和“维护黎巴嫩的领土完整和主权”的幌子的美国侵略者。
    美国侵略者的这种行为彻底违反联合国宪章的原则。联合国宪章第二条第四款规定：“所有会员国在它们的国际关系中不得以武力相威胁或使用武力来侵害任何国家的领土完整或政治独立”。想借联合国宪章来掩饰自己侵略行为的美国帝国主义，是联合国宪章原则的最粗暴的破坏者。
    艾森豪威尔在为侵略黎巴嫩而发表的声明中，竟然把伊拉克人民推翻封建王朝的革命的胜利说成为美国派兵干涉黎巴嫩的理由，并且口口声声攻击阿拉伯联合共和国。伊拉克人民的革命，正如黎巴嫩人民的武装起义一样，纯粹是各国内部的事情，而美国竟然把这种纯粹的内政说成是“侵略”。至于帝国主义者及其走狗捏造的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国渗入黎巴嫩的胡说，连联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德也早已否认过了。那么，美国为什么硬要在这些题目上作文章呢？事情很明白，美国的侵略计划不仅是针对着黎巴嫩，而且也针对着伊拉克与阿拉伯联合共和国，针对着整个中东的人民。它的狂妄企图是要扼杀整个阿拉伯东方的民族独立运动，以便在阿拉伯世界以及全部中东建立美利坚的殖民帝国。
    现在广大的阿拉伯人民已经起来了，全世界的舆论已经注视着美国的侵略阴谋，美帝国主义的狼子野心是完全可以彻底击败的。大家记得，英法帝国主义对于埃及的进攻就是这样被粉碎了的。但是这里的关键是全世界一切主张和平和正义的力量必须行动起来，不能对美帝国主义的侵略行为有任何的姑息容忍。美国政府现在竭力把它的行动装得似乎只是一件小事，以便迷惑世界的视听。决不能相信这些鬼话！现在情况异常严重。如果全世界人民和一切爱好和平的政府一致采取行动，那末，美国就不得不撤退它的军队，中东各国的独立和自由就可以得到保障，中东和世界的和平就可以得到挽救；反之，如果听任美国侵略者为所欲为，那末，不但中东的人民要遭受奴役，而且新的世界战争也将不能幸免。
    因此，为了世界和平，为了人类正义，全世界人民紧急行动起来！制止美国对黎巴嫩的干涉，制止美国对整个中东局势的干涉！美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩！不许干涉黎巴嫩、伊拉克和阿拉伯各国的内政，不许干涉亚非各国的内政！
