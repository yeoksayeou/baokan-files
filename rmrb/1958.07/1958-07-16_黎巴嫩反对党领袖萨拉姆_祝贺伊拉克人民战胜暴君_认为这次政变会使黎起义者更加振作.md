Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 14th - According to reports in newspapers here, Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam has sent a telegram to the Iraqi Supreme Power Committee congratulating the Iraqi people on their victory over the tyrannical and corrupt regime.

It is also reported that Salam, when speaking to an Associated Press reporter on July 14th about the Iraqi armed coup, said, "This is really good. I expected this kind of thing to happen. This event will definitely further inspire the Lebanese insurgents." He pointed out, "This once again reflects the true feelings of Arab nationalism, which the West has not been able to recognize before. Now is the time for the West to recognize this feeling."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 15th - Lebanese opposition leader Maksoud, who is currently visiting India, issued a statement today on the Iraqi coup, saying, "July 14th will become a great day in the history of the Arab people." He said, "This revolution will expand the peaceful area in the Middle East"; at the same time, "the Baghdad Pact will no longer be able to continue as a link between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Maksoud said that the recent developments in Iraq have made the Arab people rejoice, because these developments have brought Iraq back into the Arab nations. He pointed out that closer ties between Arab countries will enable the goals of Arab nationalism to be realized.

Maksoud condemned Lebanese pro-Western President Chamoun for requesting the United States, Britain, and France to send troops to intervene in the Iraqi coup. He pointed out that this further demonstrates the unique madness of the reactionary regime as its end approaches. He warned Western countries that if they intervene in Iraq, it will make the situation even more tense and complicated.

    黎巴嫩反对党领袖萨拉姆
    祝贺伊拉克人民战胜暴君
    认为这次政变会使黎起义者更加振作
    新华社大马士革14日电　据这里报纸报道，黎巴嫩反对党领袖、前总理赛义卜·萨拉姆已经打电报给伊拉克最高权力委员会，祝贺伊拉克人民战胜暴虐和腐败的政权。
    另据报道，萨拉姆14日对美联社记者就伊拉克武装政变发表谈话时说，这真好，我曾经预料会发生这种事情。这件事情肯定会使黎巴嫩起义者更加振作起来。他指出，“这再一次反映出了真正的阿拉伯民族主义的感情，而西方以前一直没有能够认识这种感情。现在是西方认识这种感情的时候了。”
    新华社新德里15日电　正在印度访问的黎巴嫩反对党领袖马克苏德今天就伊拉克政变发表声明说，“7月14日将要成为阿拉伯人民历史上的一个伟大日子”。他说，“这次革命将要扩大中东的和平地区”；同时，“巴格达条约将不能继续成为联结北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织的环节”。
    马克苏德说，伊拉克最近事态的发展使阿拉伯人民欢欣鼓舞，因为这种事态的发展使伊拉克回到阿拉伯国家当中来。他指出，阿拉伯国家的更加紧密的联系将使阿拉伯民族主义的目标能够实现。
    马克苏德谴责黎巴嫩亲西方的总统夏蒙要求美、英、法派兵干涉伊拉克政变。他指出，这进一步显示出反动政权在它的末日来临时特有的疯狂状态。他警告西方国家，如果它们对伊拉克进行干涉，将会使局势更加紧张和复杂化。
