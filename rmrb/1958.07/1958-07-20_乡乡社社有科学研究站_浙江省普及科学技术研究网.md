    Scientific Research Stations in Every Township and Commune:
    Zhejiang Province Popularizes Science and Technology Research Network
    (Our reporter Tu Zhengfeng reports) Under the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, in the past month or so, more than 10,000 science and technology research institutions at all levels have been established in Zhejiang Province. In particular, counties in Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Ningbo, Taizhou, and Jiande special districts have basically achieved the goal of having scientific research stations and groups in every township and commune, and researchers in every village. Vietnam District of Shaoxing County already has a district-level agricultural science and technology research institute, five township-level agricultural science and technology research stations, and sixty-six commune-level agricultural science and technology research groups. There are already more than 420 researchers in the entire district.

    Most of the newly established scientific research organizations in various places are led by secretaries, and widely absorb working people with rich practical experience and knowledge as members of the research institutions. There are now 45,000 researchers in Jinhua Special District and 80,000 in Jiaxing Special District, with considerable momentum. In the scientific research organizations of agricultural cooperatives, the principle of combining leaders, technicians, and farmers is mostly implemented. Among the 80,000 science and technology researchers in Jiaxing Special District, workers and peasants account for 90%, and cadres, teachers, students, engineers, and technicians account for 10%. Among the workers and peasants are local experts, advanced figures and technical innovators from various work areas such as plumbers, carpenters, animal breeders, porters, telephone operators, and experienced veteran farmers.

    The characteristics of these scientific research institutions are: closely focusing on production, constantly summarizing advanced experience in local industrial and agricultural production, and solving key problems in current production. According to statistics from the scientific and technological research institutions of industry, agriculture, handicraft industry, transportation, telecommunications, medical and health departments in Jiaxing Special District, more than 4,500 innovation projects in production have been researched, summarized, and promoted in the past month or so. Among them, more than 500 kinds of new agricultural tools have been created in agriculture, mainly including wooden rice transplanters, mud-dredging boats, fertilizer applicators, simple harvesters, universal threshers, mulberry cutting machines, etc., which can improve labor efficiency in more than 20 agricultural tasks. The total number of new agricultural tools that have been promoted has reached more than 800,000, with an average of one for every two laborers. It is estimated that the entire district can save 10 million workdays, greatly alleviating the difficulty of labor shortage. These tools, created and invented by workers and peasants, have been repeatedly modified and finally appraised by the masses, so they are practical, convenient, and cheap, fully conforming to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and are welcomed by the majority of farmers. In addition to studying agricultural tool reforms, the Qu County Scientific Research Institute has begun to study fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, sweet potato seedling management, selection of fine varieties, and manufacturing of bacterial fertilizers. In industry, they have begun to study small hydropower, power, and iron and steel smelting. The medical science research institutes of Wuxing and Jiaxing City have determined that the focus of research is on local endemic diseases and occupational diseases that endanger people's health. The scientific research institute of Longshan Agricultural Cooperative in Ruian County has made good achievements in the field of locally-made chemical fertilizers. They use ammonium chloride instead of ammonia water, which increases the fertilizer efficiency by five times.

    本报讯　记者屠正峰报道：浙江省普及科学技术研究网。
    在工农业生产大跃进形势下，一个多月来，浙江全省已建立了各级科学技术研究机构一万多个，特别是嘉兴、温州、金华、宁波、台州、建德等专区各县，已基本上达到了乡乡社社都有科学研究站、组，村村都有研究员。绍兴县越南区已有一个区农业科学技术研究所，五个乡农业科学技术研究站，六十六个社农业科学技术研究组，全区已有研究人员四百二十多人。
    各地新办的科学研究组织大都由书记挂帅，广泛地吸收有丰富的实践经验和知识的劳动人民作为研究机构的成员。金华专区现在已有研究人员四万五千人，嘉兴专区有八万人，声势相当浩大。在农业社的科学研究组织中，大都贯彻了领导、技术员、农民三者相结合的原则。嘉兴专区的八万个科学技术研究人员中工农群众占90％，干部、教师、学生、工程师和技术人员占10％。工农群众中有工农土专家，有泥水木工、饲养员、搬运工、话务员等各项工作中的先进人物、技术革新者和有生产经验的老农民。
    这些科学研究机构的特点是：紧密地围绕生产，随时总结本地区工农业生产中的先进经验，解决当前生产中关键性的问题。据嘉兴专区工业、农业、手工业、交通、电讯、医务等各部门科学技术研究机构的统计，在最近一个多月时间内已研究、总结、推广了生产中的革新项目四千五百种以上，其中农业方面已创造出新农具五百多种，主要的有木制插秧机、?泥船、施肥机、简易收割机、万能脱谷机、切桑机等，可以提高二十多项农活的劳动效率。已推广的新农具总数达八十多万件，平均每两个劳力即有一件，估计全区可节省劳力一千万工，大大地缓和了劳力不足的困难。这些由工农群众创造发明的工具，都经过群众反复修改和最后鉴定，因此既实用、方便，又便宜，完全符合多快好省的原则，为广大农民所欢迎。衢县科学研究所除研究农具改革外，已开始研究积肥、水利、番薯的育苗管理工作、评选良种、制造细菌肥料等项目；在工业方面他们开始研究小型水电、动力和钢铁冶炼等。吴兴和嘉兴市的医学科学研究所都确定研究重点是危害人民健康的地方流行病和职业病。瑞安县隆山农业社的科学研究所在土制化学肥料方面做出了很好的成绩，他们用氯化氨代替氨水，使肥效提高五倍。
