    Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production Continuously Improves
    Cooperative Movement Enters Climax
    The achievements in agricultural and animal husbandry production and the agricultural and animal husbandry cooperative movement in the first half of this year are significant. State-owned agricultural and animal husbandry farms have smoothly sown 77,000 hectares of land, accounting for 70% of the country's sown area. The situation of newborn livestock survival is good nationwide. The output of animal products in many regions has increased. The broad masses of herdsmen warmly welcome the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's 13th Congress resolution on developing agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives. In the past two or three months, dozens of new cooperatives have been established. The number of herding households joining cooperatives nationwide has reached over 40%, an increase of more than 5% compared to before the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's 13th Congress in March. In Bayan-Ölgii Province, on the western border, 65% of herding households have joined cooperatives. In Khuvsgul, Bulgan, Khovd and other provinces, the number of herding households joining cooperatives has reached about 50%.
    Mongolian agricultural and animal husbandry cooperatives developed rapidly during the Second Five-Year Plan period from 1953 to 1957. In the past five years, the number of cooperatives has increased nearly fourfold, the net increase rate of cooperative livestock has increased year by year, and the income of cooperative members has also been continuously increasing.

    农牧业生产不断提高
    合作化运动进入高潮
    农牧业生产和农牧业合作化运动今年上半年的成绩显著。国营农牧场顺利地播种了七万七千公顷土地，占全国播种面积的70％。全国幼畜接产情况很好。许多地区畜产品的产量有了提高。广大牧民热烈欢迎蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会关于发展农牧业合作社的决议，在最近两三个月里已经有几十个新的合作社建立起来，全国入社牧户已达到40％以上，比今年3月蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会举行以前增加了5％多。西部边境的巴彦乌列盖省已经有65％的牧户入社。库苏古尔、布拉干、科布多等省的入社牧户达到50％左右。
    蒙古农牧业合作社在1953到1957年的第二个五年计划期间发展较快。五年来合作社增加了将近四倍，合作社牲畜的纯增率逐年增加，社员的收入也在不断提高。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
