    Extensive Mobilization, Broad Cooperation
    Seize the Rainy Season for Crash Afforestation
    This newspaper reports that under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the people of the whole country continue to exert their revolutionary drive, setting off another large-scale rainy season afforestation movement following the spring afforestation.
    Good organization and extensive communist cooperation are the outstanding characteristics of this rainy season afforestation movement. Luan County, Hebei Province, organized an afforestation army of 350,000 people, led by the First Secretary of the County Party Committee. They adopted the method of county-wide cooperation to launch a crash afforestation effort, and have now completed 110,000 mu. Yishui County, Shandong Province, divided barren mountains into sections and assigned them to production teams, which not only solved the contradictions between farm work and forestry work, but also ensured timely afforestation action and improved afforestation quality. Pingyi County combined afforestation with mountain management in the rainy season afforestation, with the mountain management team also being the afforestation team, and organized large-scale cooperation between townships and communes. In Xintai County, 120,000 young and middle-aged men and women formed a mountain management and afforestation army, managing mountains on sunny days and afforesting on rainy days. After 20 days of hard work, they managed 500,000 mu of mountains and afforested all of them, ensuring that rainy season afforestation would triple that of this spring. Shandong Province prominently grasped the reliance on the masses in the rainy season afforestation and tried every possible means to solve the problem of seedlings. For example, thinning was carried out in nurseries, and the thinned seedlings were taken to the mountains with soil for afforestation; a large number of naturally growing poplar and willow seedlings in pine, cypress, poplar, and locust forests were excavated. The Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province mobilized more than 200,000 young people to "conquer the Zhongtiao Mountains in the south, fight the Lüliang Mountains in the west, and conquer the Taiyue Mountains in the east," completing 1.65 million mu of state-owned forest. Their slogan is: "Total mobilization of the people, soaring drive, large-scale cooperation by everyone, youth in the forefront, crash the distant mountains and high mountains, eliminate the half mountains; hard work in the plains for fifteen days to quintuple, complete ten years of tasks in one year!"
    The rainy season afforestation movement has also been launched in parts of Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Henan, Gansu, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi and other provinces. Qidong County, Hunan Province, recently organized a rainy season rocky mountain afforestation movement. The youth alone organized more than 3,100 people, worked hard for 13 days, and afforested 6,000 mu, with a forest area extending more than 60 li, named the "Communist Youth League Rocky Mountain Forest Belt." In order to break the superstition that afforestation cannot be carried out in the rainy season, Jiande Special District in Zhejiang Province organized forestry cadres from 13 counties in the entire special district to visit the rainy season afforestation in Changlin Township, Shouchang County. The Chinese fir, cypress, and oil-tea camellia trees planted in the rainy season two years ago not only have a very high survival rate, but also grow well, which increased the confidence to carry out large-scale rainy season afforestation.

### 广泛动员　广泛协作  抓紧雨季突击造林

    广泛动员　广泛协作
    抓紧雨季突击造林
    本报讯　在总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民继续鼓足了革命干劲，继春季造林之后又掀起了一个声势浩大的雨季造林运动。
    良好的组织性和广泛的共产主义协作，是这次雨季造林运动的突出特点。河北省滦县组织了三十五万造林大军，由县委第一书记挂帅，采取全县大协作的方法突击造林，现已完成十一万亩。山东省沂水县将荒山分片划段包给生产队，既能解决农活林活之间的矛盾，又能保证造林适时行动，提高造林质量。平邑县在雨季造林中采取了造林与治山相结合，治山队即是造林队，并组织各乡、社大协作。新泰县十二万青壮男女劳力组成治山造林大军，晴天治山，阴雨造林，苦战二十天，治山五十万亩，并全部造上林，保证雨季造林比今春造林翻三番。山东省在雨季造林中突出的抓住了依靠群众，千方百计解决种苗的问题。如对苗圃进行了间苗，间出的树苗带土上山造林；挖掘了大批松、柏、杨槐林内天然生长的杨、柳苗木。山西省晋南专区动员了二十余万名青年“南征中条山；西战吕梁山，东征太岳山”，完成义务营造国有林一百六十五万亩。他们的口号是：“全民总动员，干劲冲破天，人人大协作，青年第一线，突击远山、高山，消灭半山；平川苦战十五天翻五番，十年任务一年完！”
    雨季造林运动在云南、广东、贵州、四川、浙江、湖南、河南、甘肃、辽宁、吉林、陕西等省的部分地区也已开展起来。湖南省祁东县最近组织了一次雨季石山造林运动，单是青年就组织了三千一百余人，苦干了十三天，造林六千亩，林地长达六十余华里，定名为“共青团石山林带”。浙江省建德专区为了破除雨季不能造林的迷信，组织了全专区十三个县的林业干部参观了寿昌县长林乡的雨季造林，两年前雨季栽的杉木、柏树、油茶树不但成活率极高，而且生长良好，给大规模开展雨季造林增加了信心。
