Hubei Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of early rice on more than five million mu of land on both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. It is expected that all early rice can be harvested by early August.

This year, the increase in early rice production in Hubei Province is very large. Xiangyang Prefecture, historically known for its low yields, has increased the unit area yield and total output of its 550,000 mu of early rice by more than tenfold compared to the same season last year. In Huanggang Prefecture, a major rice-producing area, the total output of 1.7 million mu of early rice can reach 1.4 billion jin, an increase of more than two times compared to last year. The area of early rice in Jingzhou, Xiaogan and other prefectures is more than one million mu, with an average unit area yield of about 900 jin, while the average yield per mu in these areas was only 300 to 400 jin last year. Last year, only Xiaogan County in Hubei Province achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, while this year, dozens of counties have achieved this yield in the early rice season alone. Huanggang Prefecture, which has thirteen counties, has nine counties with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu of early rice this year. In Xiaogan Prefecture, the early rice yield per mu in Xiaogan, Huangpi, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Yingcheng, and Yunmeng counties also exceeds 1,000 jin. In addition, according to the estimates of 27 counties including Macheng, Xishui, and Qichun, there are 210 townships in these counties where the yield of early rice reaches 1,200 jin per mu, and 1,028 agricultural cooperatives where it reaches 1,500 jin per mu.

According to the current actual measurement and acceptance in various places, many typical examples of high-yield and large-area high-yield have emerged. In counties such as Xiaogan, Yingcheng, and Xishui, records of 3,000 and 4,000 jin per mu are common.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 28th: Anqing Prefecture, one of the major rice-producing areas in Anhui Province, has achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of early rice. According to statistics on the 25th, the total output of 500,000 mu of early rice that has been harvested in the entire prefecture reached 550 million jin, averaging 1,100 jin per mu, an increase of 1.34 times over the unit area yield of early rice last year. The 296,600 mu of early rice already harvested in Tongcheng County has an average yield of 1,200 jin per mu. Among them, 32,404 mu have a yield of more than 1,500 jin per mu, 6,703 mu have a yield of 2,000 to 2,500 jin per mu, and 828 mu have a yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu. High-yield fields also appear everywhere. According to statistics from Tongcheng, Zongyang, and Wangjiang counties alone, there are more than 1,200 mu with yields of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, with the highest yield being 8,256 jin per mu.

The area of double-cropping early rice in Anqing Prefecture is 2.5 million mu, an increase of one million mu over last year. Because this year's early rice is growing particularly well, the labor required for harvesting and threshing each mu of early rice is about three times more than in previous years. At present, farmers in various places are working day and night to rush the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 28th: Large-scale high-yield of double-cropping early rice has appeared in Huaining County, Anhui Province. The average yield per mu of the more than 42,000 mu of early rice that has been harvested in the county, most of which are of the "Nante No." variety, is 1,357 jin. Among them, 7,151 mu have a yield of more than 1,500 jin per mu, 5,249.48 mu have a yield of more than 2,000 jin, 12.76 mu have a yield of more than 2,500 jin, 24.27 mu have a yield of more than 3,000 jin, and 8.23 mu have a yield of more than 4,000 jin. The 19,000 mu of early rice in Guangxu District has been harvested, with an average yield per mu as high as 1,441 jin. The members of the cooperative praised this early rice endlessly, saying: "The rice grows so well, the ears of rice are like sorghum, and the grains are like sunflower seeds."

    湖北有几十个早稻千斤县
    安庆专区五十万亩早稻亩产一千一百斤
    本报讯　湖北省长江南北两岸五百多万亩早稻空前大丰收。预计到8月初早稻可以全部登场。
    今年湖北省早稻增产幅度很大。历来以低产出了名的襄阳专区，今年五十五万亩早稻，单位面积产量和总产量都比去年同季作物增产十倍以上。盛产水稻的黄冈专区，全区一百七十万亩早稻，总产量可以达到十四亿斤，比去年增产两倍以上。荆州、孝感等专区早稻面积都在一百万亩以上，平均单位面积产量在九百斤左右，而去年这些地区平均单产却只有三、四百斤。去年湖北省粮食平均达到千斤的只有一个孝感县，而今年仅早稻一季达到千斤的就是几十个县。拥有十三个县的黄冈专区，今年有九个县早稻平均亩产达到千斤。孝感专区的孝感、黄陂、汉川、汉阳、应城、云梦等六个县早稻单产也都在千斤以上。此外，据麻城、浠水、蕲春等二十七个县的预计，在这些县内，早稻亩产达到一千二百斤的乡有二百一十个，一千五百斤的社有一千零二十八个。
    根据目前各地实打验收的情况来看，还涌现了不少高额丰产和大面积高产的典型。孝感、应城、浠水等县，亩产达到三千、四千斤的纪录，到处皆是。
    据新华社合肥28日电　安徽省主要产稻区之一的安庆专区，早稻获得了空前未有的大面积丰收。据25日统计，全专区已收割的五十万亩早稻，总产量达五亿五千万斤，平均每亩合一千一百斤，比去年的早稻单位面积产量提高了一点三四倍。桐城县已经收割的二十九万六千亩早稻，平均亩产达一千二百斤。其中亩产一千五百斤以上有三万二千四百零四亩，两千到两千五百斤的六千七百零三亩，三千斤以上八百二十八亩。高额丰产田也到处出现，仅据桐城、枞阳、望江三县统计，亩产三千斤到四千斤以上的有一千二百多亩，最高的亩产八千二百五十六斤。
    安庆专区双季早稻共二百五十万亩，比去年扩大了一百万亩。由于今年早稻长得特别好，每亩早稻的收割和脱粒所需的人工，要比往年增加三倍左右。目前各地农民都在日夜突击抢收。
    据新华社合肥28日电　安徽省怀宁县双季早稻出现大面积高额丰产。全县已收的四万二千多亩早稻，绝大部分是南特号品种，平均亩产一千三百五十七斤。其中亩产一千五百斤以上的有七千一百五十一亩，二千斤以上的五千二百四十九亩四分八厘，二千五百斤以上的十二亩七分六厘，三千斤以上的二十四亩二分七厘，四千斤以上的八亩二分三厘。广圩区一万九千多亩早稻已收割完毕，平均亩产量高达一千四百四十一斤。社员们对这块早稻夸不绝口说：长这样好稻，稻穗像高粱，籽粒赛葵花籽。
