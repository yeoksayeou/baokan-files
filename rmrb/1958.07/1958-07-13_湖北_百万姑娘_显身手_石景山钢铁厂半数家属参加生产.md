Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: The Hubei Provincial Women's Federation is widely launching the "Million 'Girls' Movement" among rural women, establishing one million female pacesetters for high yields and abundant harvests. Anyone who achieves or exceeds a per-mu yield of 1,000 catties of double-season rice, or 150 catties of ginned cotton, or becomes a production expert in other crops, will receive the glorious title of "Girl."

This spring, rural women in Hubei Province widely discussed the exemplary deeds of rice girl Peng Xueying (Director of Suwei Fourth Cooperative in Zaoyang County, who achieved a single-season per-mu rice yield of 2,963 catties last year) and cotton girl Zhou Yanying (member of Shouyi Cooperative in Sui County, who achieved a per-mu ginned cotton yield of 421 catties last year). "Learn from Xueying, catch up with Yanying, achieve double thousand catties, rely entirely on technological innovation; surpass the two girls, wear flowers to Beijing!" has become a resounding slogan for rural women in production competitions. Women have started planting experimental fields one after another. According to statistics from forty-one counties alone, over one million women have planted over two million mu of experimental rice, cotton, and wheat fields. Jin Cuichai, a girl from Yanghe Township, is conducting an experiment of "one hundred catties of cotton from one hundred cotton plants" in her experimental field. She expressed her determination on a big-character poster, saying, "Cuichai is eighteen this year, experimenting with one catty of cotton from one cotton plant, mastering technical operations, remembering it day and night; this is my determined word, I won't marry until the plan is completed!" Women planting oil crops, sweet potatoes, ramie, and those engaged in silkworm rearing and tea picking have also launched competitions with each other, and new records are constantly emerging. For example, the high record of 121 catties of cocoons per silkworm card created by silkworm raiser Lin Shuying last year has been broken by this year's record of 156 catties; the high record of 45 catties of tea picked per day created by Li Zhongxin of Wufeng County last year has also been broken by the "Seven Fairies" (farmers call Feng Jinlian and six other tea-picking girls the Seven Fairies) who use the three-finger double-hand tea-picking method to pick 100 catties per day.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Half of the family members of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant who have the ability to work have already participated in various production and service labor. Recently, on the main road in the family area leading to the factory, large numbers of women wearing newly bought straw hats and gloves can be seen every day, going to work with the men, full of vigor.

After the expansion project of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant began, a large number of laborers were needed to participate in the construction. According to incomplete statistics, among the family members of workers in this factory, there are more than 5,400 women with the ability to work between the ages of sixteen and forty-five. Based on the needs of the work and the demands of the family members, the factory leadership decided to organize them to participate in production and service activities. As of the 10th, more than 2,500 family members have taken up labor positions.

Family members of workers participate in production and service activities in the following aspects:

	First, supporting the factory's expansion project, engaging in labor such as sifting sand, digging earth, paving roadbeds, and digging slag.

	Second, contracting various odd jobs in the factory, such as picking up scrap iron, mending sacks, packaging products, and engaging in light transportation.

	Third, going to auxiliary departments such as production workshops, hospitals, and canteens to serve as auxiliary workers, ordinary workers, cleaners, and cooks. In order to familiarize themselves with technology and business, they generally follow the shifts first.

	Fourth, organizing various handicraft production groups.

	Fifth, organizing housework. After a large number of women participated in production, eleven nurseries and thirteen canteens run by the masses themselves have emerged in the family area. In addition, they have also set up sewing groups and laundry groups, and some family members are learning hairdressing. They are also preparing to take over and run the commerce and service industries in their family area.

The activities of the family members of workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in participating in production and service undertakings have received strong support from the factory's Party committee and trade union organizations, but are still in the trial stage.

    湖北“百万姑娘”显身手
    石景山钢铁厂半数家属参加生产
    据新华社武汉12日电　湖北省妇联组织正在农村妇女中广泛展开
  “百万‘姑娘’运动”，树立一百万个妇女高额丰产旗帜。凡是今年能达到或超过亩产水稻双千斤、或皮棉一百五十斤，或其他作物的生产能手，都将得到光荣的“姑娘”称号。
    今年春天，湖北省农村妇女曾经普遍讨论了水稻姑娘彭学英（枣阳县苏维四社主任，去年水稻单季亩产二千九百六十三斤）和棉花姑娘周延英（随县守义社社员，去年皮棉亩产四百二十一斤）的模范事迹。“学学英、赶延英，实现双千斤，全靠技术大革新；赶过两姑娘，带花上北京！”已成为农村妇女在生产竞赛中的响亮口号。妇女们纷纷种起试验田。仅据四十一个县的统计，就有一百多万妇女种了二百多万亩水稻、棉花、小麦试验田。杨河乡姑娘靳翠钗，在自己的试验田里作“百个棉棵百斤花”的试验，她在大字报上表示决心说，“翠钗今年一十八，试验一株棉棵一斤花，技术操作作到家，日日夜夜记着它；这是我的决心话，不完成规划不出嫁！”种植油料作物、红薯、苎麻以及养蚕、采茶的妇女也都互相展开竞赛，新纪录不断出现。如蚕娘林淑英去年创造的每张蚕纸产一百二十一斤茧的高纪录，已被今年一百五十六斤的纪录所打破；五峰县黎仲新去年创造的每天采茶四十五斤的高纪录，今年也被“七仙女”（农民称冯金莲等七个采茶姑娘为七仙女）用三指双手采茶法日采一百斤的纪录所打破。
    据新华社12日讯　石景山钢铁厂有劳动能力的职工家属，已经有半数参加了各种生产和服务劳动。最近，在家属区通向工厂的大路上，每天都可以看到大批妇女戴着新买的草帽和手套，神采焕发地和男人们一起去上工。
    石景山钢铁厂扩建工程开始后，需要大批劳动力来参加建设。据不完全统计，在这个厂的职工家属中，从十六岁到四十五岁有劳动能力的妇女就有五千四百多人。工厂的领导上根据工作的需要和家属们的要求，决定组织她们参加生产和服务活动。到10日为止，已有二千五百多名家属走上了劳动岗位。
    职工家属们参加生产、服务活动有这样几方面：
    第一，支援工厂的扩建工程，从事筛沙子、挖土方、铺路基和挖炉渣等劳动。
    第二，包干工厂的各种零活，像拣碎铁、补麻袋、包装产品和从事轻便搬运等。
    第三，到生产车间、医院、食堂等附属部门，担任辅助工、普通工、清洁工、炊事员。为了熟悉技术和业务，她们一般先跟班劳动。
    第四，组织各种手工业生产小组。
    第五，把家务劳动组织起来。大批妇女参加生产以后，在家属区里已经出现了群众自办的十一个托儿站和十三个食堂。此外，她们还自办了缝纫组、洗衣组，有些家属正在学习理发，她们还准备把本家属区的商业、服务业接过来自办。
    石景山钢铁厂职工家属们参加生产和服务事业的活动，得到了工厂党委和工会组织的大力支持，但现在尚在试办阶段。
