Two Teenagers Cultivate Four Clumps of "Early Rice King"

    (Our dispatch) News from this newspaper: Two teenagers from the Youyong Agricultural Cooperative in Lexian Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, have cultivated four clumps of "Early Rice King." The largest clump is 117 centimeters (three and a half feet) tall, with 139 effective tillers. Each ear of rice is about 30 centimeters (nine inches) long, bearing a total of 24,436 grains, weighing one catty, four taels, and three qian. The other three clumps are similar to this one, with yields all exceeding one catty.

    The older of the two teenagers is Qing Ende, 16 years old, a primary school graduate. The younger is Qing Guangfu, 15 years old, who completed five books of primary school. This spring, when transplanting early rice, all cooperatives in the township launched a vigorous high-yield campaign. Seeing everyone cultivating high-yield experimental fields, they felt envious and secretly discussed trying it themselves. They picked up the leftover seedlings that the adults had not used and carefully transplanted them into an old pond. The transplanting method completely imitated the adults' practices, with spacing varying from five to seven inches, planting a total of 661 clumps intermittently. This old pond was a perfect "experimental field," with a foot-deep layer of fertile mud at the bottom. Due to the drought, the water accumulation was very shallow, which was very suitable for the growth of rice. The seedlings were planted after Grain Rain and quickly turned green, tillered vigorously, and grew luxuriantly. These two "little experimenters" visited every few days. Although no fertilizer had been applied, the seedlings grew better than all the surrounding rice, eventually exceeding the height of their little masters.

    These clumps of early rice are all of the "Nante No. 1" variety. In the past, many cadres believed that Nante No. 1 did not tiller strongly, but this statement has now been overturned. The good growth of these clumps of rice once again proves the importance of deep plowing and applying sufficient base fertilizer.

    Recently, township cadres have been experimenting with planting 10,000-jin rice fields, but some people simply do not believe it can be done. The emergence of these "Early Rice Kings" has opened people's eyes. If every clump grows this well, then each mu can yield 20,000 jin.

    The largest of these four clumps has now been sent to Zizhong County for exhibition.

### 两少年培植四窝“早稻王”

    两少年培植四窝“早稻王”
    本报讯　四川省资中县乐贤乡有勇农业社的两个少年培植出四窝“早稻王”。最大的一窝株高一百一十七公分（三尺半），有效分蘖一百三十九根，每穗长三十公分（九寸）左右，共结籽二万四千四百三十六粒，重一斤四两三钱。其余的三窝和这个相差不多，产量都在一斤以上。
    这两个少年大的叫卿恩德，今年十六岁，是初小毕业生；小的叫卿光富，十五岁，读过初小五册书。今年春天栽插早稻时，全乡各社展开了轰轰烈烈的高产运动。他们看到，人人都在培植高产试验田，心里很羡慕，两人暗地商量也来设法试一下。他们把大人剩下没有用完的秧苗拣起来，细心地移栽到一口旧塘里。栽插的办法完全仿照大人的作法，窝距五寸至七寸不等，前后断续栽插了六百六十一窝。这口旧塘是再好不过的“试验田”，塘底肥泥有一尺深，由于干旱，积水很浅，正适宜水稻的生长。秧苗在谷雨栽上以后即迅速转青，发蔸强，生长茁壮。这两位“小试验家”每隔几天前往看望一次。虽然没有施过肥，秧苗生长得比周围所有的水稻都好，最后，它的高度超过了小主人。
    这几窝早稻都是“南特号”品种，过去许多干部认为南特号发蔸不强，现在这种说法被推翻了。这几窝稻长得这样好，再一次证明了深耕和施足底肥的重要性。
    最近乡干部在试种万斤水稻田，有些人硬是不相信能够办到，这些“早稻王”的出现，打开了人们的眼界。如果每窝都长得这样好，每亩就可以收两万斤。
    现在这四窝中最大的一窝，已被送往资中县城里展览。
