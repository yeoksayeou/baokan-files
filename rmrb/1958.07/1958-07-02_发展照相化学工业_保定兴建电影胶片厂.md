Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 1st: The Baoding Motion Picture Film Manufacturing Plant broke ground on July 1st in the western suburbs of Baoding. Once fully completed, this factory will be able to produce 350 million meters of film annually. This includes various black and white and color films for shooting movies, magnetic recording tape for film and radio, X-ray film for medical and industrial use, film for aerial photography, scientific research, and printing plate making, as well as various photographic film, rolls, and photographic paper.

The photographic chemical industry is a new industrial sector, and its products are essential for film, television, radio, medical and health, printing, surveying, astronomy, automatic control, industrial technology, atomic energy research, and more. Currently, China is unable to manufacture products such as motion picture film and X-ray film. Although a small number of products like photographic paper and photographic film can be manufactured, the quantities are small, and raw materials rely on imports. The completion of this enterprise will fundamentally change this backward situation.

    发展照相化学工业
    保定兴建电影胶片厂
    据新华社保定1日电　保定电影胶片制造厂，于7月1日在保定市西郊破土动工。这座工厂全部建成后，每年可以生产三亿五千万公尺胶片。其中除了拍摄电影用的各种黑白和彩色胶片，还有电影及广播用的磁性录音带，医学及工业用的X——光胶片，航空摄影、科学研究、印刷制版用的胶片，以及各种照相胶片、胶卷、照相纸等。
    照相化学工业是一个新兴的工业部门，无论电影、电视、广播、医药卫生、印刷、测量、天文、自动控制、工业技术、原子能研究等等，都要使用它提供的制品。目前我国像电影胶片、X——光片等制品都还不能制造，照相纸和照相胶片等少数制品虽能制造，数量很少，原料也要依赖进口。随着这个企业的建成，将根本改变这方面的落后状况。
