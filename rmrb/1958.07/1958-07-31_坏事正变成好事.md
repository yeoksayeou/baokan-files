    Bad Things Are Turning Into Good Things
    The drought currently affecting Jilin, Anhui, and other provinces is a matter of concern for people across the country. However, the broad masses and cadres at all levels in these provinces, with a firm confidence in guaranteeing increased production, are engaging in large-scale water conservancy efforts in the fight against drought. They are intercepting river water, drawing lake water, finding springs, and digging ditches and ponds, achieving considerable results. At the same time, various improved tools for drought resistance are being created and promoted at an extremely rapid pace, and the spirit of communist mutual assistance and cooperation among the masses is being greatly developed. The cold-hearted heavens are attempting to bring disaster to these people, but the unyielding masses are bracing themselves, boosting their energy, and transforming bad things into good ones. Here, we see once again how high the spirit, how strong the fighting will, and how immense the power are when the masses face difficult circumstances! In the face of the Chinese people, there are no insurmountable difficulties, no invincible enemies.

    坏事正变成好事
    吉林、安徽等省目前的旱情受到全国人民的关心。但是，这些省区的广大群众和各级干部怀着保证增产的坚强信心，在抗旱斗争中，大兴水利，拦河水、提湖水、找泉眼、挖沟塘，取得不小的成绩；与此同时，各种抗旱用的改良工具也以极高的速度在创造、在推广，群众中间的共产主义互助协作精神更得到大大的发扬。冷心的天公企图给这些人民带来一场灾难，但不屈的群众却抖擞精神，鼓起干劲，把坏事正转化为好事。在这里，我们又一次看到当群众面临困难的处境的时候，精神是怎样的昂扬，斗志是怎样的坚强，力量是怎样的巨大！在中国人民面前，没有克服不了的困难，没有战胜不了的敌人。
