Comrades, Fellow Compatriots:
    Ignoring the grave warnings and firm opposition of the Arab people and all peace-loving people of the world, U.S. imperialism brazenly sent troops to invade Lebanon, interfered in the internal affairs of Arab countries, and attempted to maintain its bloody rule in the Near and Middle East countries through military adventures, suppress the Arab national independence movement, and undermine peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. We feel boundless indignation!
    The struggles of the Lebanese and Iraqi people against colonialism, for national independence, and to safeguard peace in the Middle East are entirely just struggles. We warmly hail the great victory of the Iraqi people! We pay the highest respect to the fighting Lebanese people and the insurgents! U.S. imperialism's armed invasion of Lebanon and threats of armed intervention against the Iraqi people are a challenge to all peace-loving and freedom-loving humanity, and further demonstrate that U.S. imperialism is a bloodthirsty jackal and the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in the world!
    As everyone knows, after World War II, U.S. imperialism and other colonialist countries, in order to continue maintaining colonialism, successively launched armed invasions against China, Korea, Vietnam, and Egypt, and carried out shameless subversive activities against newly independent nations in Asia and Africa. However, none of the invaders escaped a shameful defeat, and victory always belongs to the people who oppose aggression. Today, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger than ever before, the anti-colonialist momentum of the Asian and African people is becoming increasingly magnificent, and the unity of the Arab countries is even stronger. We solemnly warn the U.S. and British aggressors here: If you do not learn a lesson from the series of shameful failures in the past, and immediately stop the aggression against Lebanon and the interference in the affairs of the Iraqi people, then the Middle East will become the graveyard of imperialism!
    The solemn statements by our government and the Soviet government demanding the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from Lebanon are the common voice of all peace-loving people in the world, and also represent an irresistible force of justice. No matter what name U.S. imperialists usurp, and what banner they wave to invade Lebanon and interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries, they cannot conceal the nature of their jackals, change their fate of failure, or escape all the responsibilities they should bear. Reining in at the edge of the cliff and changing course with the wind is the only way out for the invaders!
    All peace-loving people in the world stand firmly on the side of the people of the Middle East countries. We Chinese people suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression for a long time in the past. Therefore, we have the deepest brotherly sympathy for the struggles of the Lebanese and Iraqi people. We believe that the struggle of the Arab people is our struggle, and we absolutely cannot tolerate and sit idly by while U.S., British, French, and other imperialists carry out aggression and interference against Middle Eastern countries. The 600 million Chinese people vow to fully support the struggle of the Lebanese and Iraqi people, and vow to be the backing of all the Arab people, the backing of the Iraqi people!
    Let all peace-loving people of the world unite and sever the devil's hand of the imperialist aggressors!
    Resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Iraq!
    Resolutely oppose the U.S. and British imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon and Iraq!
    Resolutely overthrow imperialist interference in the Arab national independence movement!
    Long live the victory of the Iraqi and Lebanese people's anti-aggression struggle!
    Long live the victory of the national independence movement in Middle Eastern countries!
    Long live the victory of the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose aggression!

    斩断帝国主义侵略的魔爪
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深的讲话同胞们，同志们：
    美帝国主义不顾阿拉伯人民和全世界爱好和平人民的严重警告和坚决反对，悍然出兵侵略黎巴嫩，干涉阿拉伯各国的内政，企图以军事冒险维持其在中近东国家的血腥统治，镇压阿拉伯民族的独立运动，破坏亚非和全世界的和平，我们感到无比的愤怒！
    黎巴嫩人民和伊拉克人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立、维护中东地区和平的斗争，完全是正义的斗争。我们热烈欢呼伊拉克人民的伟大胜利！向战斗中的黎巴嫩人民和起义军致以最崇高的敬意！美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩，并且威胁要武装干涉伊拉克人民，这是对全体爱好和平自由人类的挑战，也再一次说明美帝国主义是嗜血成性的豺狼，是全世界爱好和平的人民的死敌！
    大家知道，美帝国主义和其他殖民主义国家，在第二次世界大战以后，为了继续维持殖民主义，曾经先后武装侵略中国，侵略朝鲜，侵略越南，侵略埃及，并对亚非民族独立国家进行无耻的阴谋颠复活动，但是侵略者无一不遭到可耻的失败，胜利总是属于反对侵略的人民。今天，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营比过去任何一个时期都更为强大，亚非人民反殖民主义的声势也越来越为波澜壮阔，阿拉伯各国人民的团结也更为坚强有力了。我们在这里严重地警告美英侵略者：如果你们不从过去一系列的可耻失败中吸取教训，立即停止对黎巴嫩的侵略和对伊拉克人民的干涉，那么，中东就将成为埋葬帝国主义的坟墓！
    我国政府和苏联政府要求美帝国主义侵略军立即撤出黎巴嫩的严正声明，是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同心声，也代表着一种不可抗拒的正义的力量。无论美帝国主义者盗用任何名义，打着什么幌子来侵略黎巴嫩和干涉阿拉伯各国的内政，都掩饰不了它们豺狼的本相，也改变不了它们失败的命运，更逃避不了它们应负的一切责任。悬崖勒马，见风转舵，才是侵略者唯一的出路！
    全世界爱好和平的人民都是坚决站在中东各国人民一边的。我们中国人民过去曾经长期受帝国主义侵略和压迫，因此，我们对于黎巴嫩人民和伊拉克人民的斗争，有着最深切的兄弟般同情。我们认为阿拉伯人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争，我们绝对不能容忍和坐视美英法等帝国主义对中东国家的侵略和干涉；六万万中国人民誓以全力支持黎巴嫩人民和伊拉克人民的斗争，誓为全体阿拉伯人民的后盾，伊拉克人民的后盾！
    全世界爱好和平的人民一致行动起来斩断帝国主义侵略者的魔手！
    坚决反对美帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩、伊拉克的内政！
    坚决反对美、英帝国主义对黎巴嫩、伊拉克的武装侵略！
    坚决打倒帝国主义对阿拉伯民族独立运动的干涉！
    伊拉克人民和黎巴嫩人民反侵略斗争的胜利万岁！
    中东各国民族独立运动胜利万岁！
    全世界人民保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争胜利万岁！
