Ode Participating in the Completion Ceremony of the Ming Tombs Reservoir
Chen Yi

    I.
    Gazing afar, the dam stretches halfway across the sky, a slanting wall of dozens of fathoms seen up close.
    Four hundred thousand people can resolve it quickly, a gigantic project promised to be completed in five months.

    II.
    The reservoir's unveiling radiates glory, the names of those who participated in the labor are fragrant.
    If asked who the builders are, the answer is workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants.

    III.
    The troops participate in building the reservoir, learning to be both martial and cultured.
    Every person joins the ranks, and everyone in the ranks is for the people.

    IV.
    The people established their capital near Yanyun, eight years of construction, truly arduous.
    Reservoirs line up in succession, from Guanting and Huairou to the Ming Tombs.

    V.
    Stars and moon dimly light the construction site, the red sun blazes, no return at noon.
    Suddenly, the masses shout in unison, comrades from the Central Committee have come to labor.

    VI.
    All tasks are undertaken simultaneously throughout the country, a hundred flowers bloom, a great debate contends.
    Political ideological work is already outstanding, labor training is most beneficial to people.

    VII.
    Foreign guests come to labor in groups, envoys from various countries also leave their fragrance.
    We should express our gratitude for their sympathy, a fraction of labor, a fraction of glory.

    VIII.
    From now on, water in the suburbs of Beijing will flow into the canals, ending drought and flood forever.
    Everywhere farmland can be irrigated, seeing new seedlings with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    IX.
    Battles clouds are rising in several places, but we lay the foundation for peace with construction.
    Any situation can be reversed, mastering our destiny lies in the people.

    X.
    Water conservancy development, large, medium, and small, a combination of foreign and local methods is heard everywhere.
    Water conservancy will spread throughout China within a year, not just irrigating the Ming Tombs.

    XI.
    Stars and moon in the sky are shining, red lights on the ground burn through the night.
    This is a night of celebration, a million songs and dances, no need to return home.

    XII.
    Wind blowing the water stirs up clouds, peaks on all sides are shrouded in the setting sun.
    The landscape is truly beautiful, our land, watching China blooming everywhere.

    XIII.
    Six hundred million people, unparalleled in the world, have defeated powerful enemies with grace.
    Now aiming at the natural world, we roam freely on earth and in the sky.

    参加十三陵水库完工典礼的颂歌
    陈毅
    一
    远望水坝半天横，近看斜壁数十寻。
    四十万人能速决，巨工五月便期成。
    二
    水库揭幕发辉光，参加劳动姓字香。
    为问谁是建设者，答言工农兵学商。
    三
    部队参加修水库，学习能武又能文。
    人民个个尽入伍，入伍个个为人民。
    四
    人民定都傍燕云，八载建设真辛勤。
    接连水库排班至，官厅怀柔到明陵。
    五
    星月淡淡上工地，赤日炎炎午不回。
    万众突然齐呐喊，中央同志劳动来。
    六
    全国各项皆并举，百花齐放大争鸣。
    政治务虚已卓绝，劳动锻炼最惠人。
    七
    外宾成群来劳动，各国使节亦留芳。
    对我同情应申谢，一分劳动一分光。
    八
    从此京郊水归漕，一劳永逸无旱涝。
    处处农田能排灌，多快好省看新苗。
    九
    几处起伏布战云，我以建设奠和平。
    任何局势可扭转，掌握命运在人民。
    十
    水利开发大中小，洋土结合到处闻。
    期年水利遍中国，岂独浸润十三陵。
    十一
    天上星月正交辉，地面红灯夜不吹。
    此是庆功欢乐夜，百万歌舞不须归。
    十二
    风吹水动生云气，四面峰峦罩落霞。
    江山信美真吾土，遍地开花看中华。
    十三
    六亿人口世无俦，打败强敌已风流。
    而今对准自然界，入地上天逍遥游。
    （一九五八年七月）
