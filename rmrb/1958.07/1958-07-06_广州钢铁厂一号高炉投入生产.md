Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou—The first blast furnace of the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant has been completed and put into production on the 1st of this month. This blast furnace can produce 60 tons of iron per day.

The Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant began construction in October last year. In accordance with the General Line of "going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results", the plant revised its original plan during the Great Leap Forward. Comparing only the third phase of the new plan with the original plan: the investment will only increase by one-third, while the output of steel, iron, coke, etc. can be increased by one to three times, and the construction time can be shortened by two years. After the entire plant is completed, it will have workshops for blast furnaces, electric furnaces, converters, steel rolling, seamless steel pipes, coking, sintering, forging, and chemicals. It will provide a large amount of raw materials for the South China industrial base and train technical personnel and gain construction experience for new iron and steel plants in South China.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee attached great importance to the construction of this plant, and fraternal factories inside and outside the province also gave strong support in various aspects. More than 1,000 construction workers worked hard day and night, which finally enabled the plant's No. 1 blast furnace to be put into production one quarter ahead of schedule.

    广州钢铁厂一号高炉投入生产
    新华社广州讯　广州钢铁厂第一座高炉已经建成，并在1日投入生产。这座高炉每天可以出铁六十吨。
    广州钢铁厂是在去年10月动工兴建的。按照多快好省的建设方针，这个厂在大跃进中又修改了原来的计划。仅将新计划的第三期工程与原计划相比：投资只增加三分之一，而钢、铁、焦等的产量却可以增加一倍到三倍多，建设时间可以提前两年。这个厂全部建成后，将拥有高炉、电炉、转炉、轧钢、无缝钢管、焦化、烧结、锻造、化工等车间，将为华南工业基地提供大量原材料，并为华南地区新的钢铁厂培养技术力量和取得建设经验。
    中共广东省委、广州市委十分重视这个厂的建设，省内外各兄弟厂也从各方面给予大力支援。一千多名工地建设者夜以继日地艰苦劳动，终于使这个厂一号高炉比原计划提前一个季度投入了生产。
