    Difficulties and Joys
    Ying Lin
    In the face of difficulties, there are two diametrically opposed attitudes. Some people despise difficulties, dare to fight them, and regard overcoming difficulties as a kind of joy. Under the domination of this revolutionary optimism, these people have particularly great drive and a spirit of perseverance, creating earth-shattering achievements: building flat roads in dangerous mountains, turning low-lying, easily flooded, and barren land into fertile fields, winning unprecedented bumper harvests in the face of severe drought threats, carrying out various inventions and creations under difficult conditions... Such people are true revolutionaries, promoters of our cause, and conquering difficulties is their unique talent.
    Others are just the opposite. They are afraid of difficulties, complaining and sighing at the slightest setback, not only finding no joy but feeling as if they are suffering. Their drive and a spirit of perseverance are therefore particularly small, or even non-existent. Consequently, they not only cannot accomplish earth-shattering achievements, but they cannot even do what others can. Such people are revolutionary pessimists, often the conservatives and detractors of our cause.
    Why is it that some revolutionary workers are so valiant and unyielding in the face of difficulties, worthy of being heroes, while others cannot stand upright and are intimidated by difficulties? The former have a sincere heart for the revolution, and at the same time, they have a correct way of observing problems. They understand that the reason there are revolutionaries in the world is because there are so many difficulties; the task of revolutionaries is to overcome difficulties, and all difficulties can be overcome. They are full of confidence in our cause. They understand that the more and greater the difficulties overcome, the greater the contribution to the revolutionary cause, and the more and greater happiness the people will receive as a result. For revolutionaries, this is supreme glory and the greatest joy.
    As for the latter, although it cannot be said that they have no thought of serving the people, they lack vigorous drive, they are often listless, and their revolutionary will is not strong enough, or even declining. This is certain. They are satisfied with the status quo, thinking that everything is already very good, and what is the need to work hard day and night, regardless of the heat and cold? Isn't this just making trouble for themselves? They advocate that everything should be done slowly, only in this way is it most safe and reliable; otherwise, they will take risks and make mistakes, which they are unwilling to do. They also often exaggerate the difficulties, always seeing the difficult side of problems too much, not seeing or rarely seeing the favorable aspects, and treating difficulties as if they are fixed and unchangeable, which further increases their fear of difficulties. In this way, in the face of difficulties, they will of course not have high confidence, will not have enough energy, and will not regard overcoming difficulties as a kind of joy, but will regard encountering difficulties as the most unlucky thing. How can such people not become laggards of the times?
    May the latter wake up quickly, learn from the former, and catch up with the former.

    困难和乐趣
    应麟
    在困难的面前，有两种截然不同的态度。一种人藐视困难，敢于同困难搏斗，把克服困难视作一种乐趣。在这种革命乐观主义支配之下，这种人的干劲和钻劲特别大，做出了惊天动地的事业：在险峻的山岭修起了平坦的公路，把低洼易涝和贫瘠的土地变成了肥美的良田，在严重的干旱威胁中夺得了前所未有的大丰收，在困难的条件下，进行各种发明创造，……。这种人是真正的革命者，是我们的事业的促进派，征服困难是他们特有的才能。
    另一种人则恰好相反。他们害怕困难，一遇到困难就叫苦连天，唉声叹气，不仅毫无乐趣可言，好像是在受罪。他们的干劲和钻劲也就特别小，甚至就没有什么干劲和钻劲，因而不仅做不出惊天动地的事业，而且连别人能作到的事也作不到。这种人是革命的悲观主义者，常常是我们事业的保守派和促退派。
    同是革命工作人员，为什么在困难的面前有人是那样地英勇顽强，不愧为英雄好汉；而有人却挺不起腰板，被困难吓倒了呢？原来前一种人对革命有一颗赤诚的心，同时又有观察问题的正确方法。他们懂得，世界上之所以有革命者存在，就是因为有许许多多的困难；革命者的任务就是克服困难，一切困难都可以克服。他们对我们的事业充满了信心。他们懂得，克服的困难愈多愈大，对革命事业的贡献也就愈多愈大，而人民也就会因此得到更多更大的幸福。对于革命者来说，这是无尚的光荣，也是最大的快乐。
    而对于后一种人，虽然不能说他们没有为人民服务的思想，但是缺乏朝气蓬勃的干劲，他们往往是暮气沉沉，革命意志不够坚强，甚至正在衰退，这是可以肯定的。他们满足于现状，以为目前的一切已经很不错了，有什么必要不分日夜、不分酷暑和严寒地实干苦干呢？这不是在自找苦吃吗？他们主张一切都应该慢慢来，只有这样才是最稳妥可靠的；否则就会冒风险、犯错误，这是他们不肯干的。他们还常常夸大了困难，看问题总是过多地看到困难的一面，看不到或者很少看到有利的方面，而且把困难看作了似乎是固定不变的东西，这就更加加重了他们对困难的惧怕。这样，在困难的面前，他们当然就不会有很高的信心，不会有很足的劲头，更不会把克服困难看作是一种乐趣，而是把碰到困难看作最倒霉不过的事情。这种人怎么会不作时代的落伍者呢？
    愿后一种人，赶快觉悟过来，学习前一种人，赶上前一种人。
