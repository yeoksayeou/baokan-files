(Xinhua News Agency Report) Many Pakistani political party leaders and newspapers have condemned the US-British armed aggression against the Middle East, opposed the Pakistani government's support of US-British aggression, and demanded that the government immediately recognize the Republic of Iraq.

    Karim, a member of the Pakistani National Assembly and leader of the National People's Party, demanded that Prime Minister Noon immediately convene an emergency meeting of the National Assembly to debate the Pakistani government's policy towards Middle Eastern countries. He said, "Our democratic forces should unite and express their solidarity with the freedom fighters of the Middle East." He also called on the government to recognize the Republic of Iraq and demanded that US troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon.
    The Karachi organization of this party passed a resolution at an emergency meeting held on the 18th, hailing the birth of the Republic of Iraq as a symbol of the victory of progressive Arab nationalism. The meeting condemned the aggressive acts of the US and British troops landing in Lebanon and Jordan, considering them "a direct and shameful interference in the internal affairs of these countries." The meeting demanded that the Pakistani government immediately recognize the Republic of Iraq, requested that Prime Minister Noon immediately convene a meeting of all parties to discuss the Middle East situation and Pakistan's foreign policy, and warned the Pakistani government not to take any unilateral measures to participate in the active interference of imperialist countries in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, because this policy is harmful to the relationship between Pakistan and the Arab people and is playing with fire.
    Usmani, the party's general secretary, issued a statement as early as the 15th, saying that the developments in Iraq showed that "the Baghdad Pact has never received any public support from the Iraqi people." He said: "The Baghdad Pact directly hurts the strong Arab nationalist sentiment, which has become a phenomenon that cannot be ignored in the post-war period. Like the Egyptian people, the Iraqi people also believe that the Baghdad Pact is a premeditated action to undermine the unity of the Arab people.
    Usmani said: "The nationalist new government established in Iraq is obviously trusted by the vast majority of the Iraqi people." He said: "We in Pakistan cannot take a passive and bystander attitude towards these major events that are happening everywhere. We must demand through constitutional means that the Pakistani government immediately recognize the new Republic of the Iraqi people." He said, "It is further frustrating and surprising that President Mirza has done some things alone that are not within his purview under the constitution."
    Qayyum Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Muslim League, on the 18th severely condemned the communique issued in Ankara by the heads of the three Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan.
    He said: "Our troops must not be sent abroad. We cannot let ourselves engage in imperialist schemes."
    Qayyum Khan warned the government not to pursue a policy of supporting Western countries in continuing to divide the Arab nation and preventing the rising tide of Arab nationalism, as this would have dangerous consequences.
    Akhtar Ali Khan, chairman of the People's League, said in a statement on the 17th that the fate of Pakistan should be decided by the people of the whole country. "No ruling or opposition individual or party has the right to gamble with the fate of Pakistan."
    Nine leaders from seven different political parties, including the Lahore Republican Party, the People's League, the National People's Party, and the Muslim League, made a request on the 18th, saying that the Pakistani government should immediately recognize the Republic of Iraq. In a joint statement issued in Lahore, these leaders guaranteed their full support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Middle East. They also believed that, according to any legal and moral principles, the landing of US troops in Lebanon was unjustified. They also demanded that the United Nations Security Council prevent Western countries from interfering in the Middle East. The statement said that it was regrettable that at the Baghdad Pact meeting that recently ended in Turkey, Pakistan expressed its support for the actions of the West.
    In addition, the famous leader of the Pakistani religious community, Grand Mullah Badayuni, issued a statement saying that it is the obligation of the Pakistani government to fully respect the wishes of the Muslim world. He warned the government not to take any rash measures in the Middle East.
    Sixty-three lawyers in Karachi jointly requested the Karachi Bar Association on the evening of the 18th to convene a general meeting to protest against the intervention of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan. They also demanded that the Pakistani government recognize the Republic of Iraq.
    With the exception of two newspapers, the rest condemned the armed intervention of the United States and Britain in the people of the Middle Eastern countries and demanded that the government change its foreign policy.
    The "Karachi Times" criticized the claim that Pakistan should fulfill the obligations imposed on it by the Baghdad Pact. The newspaper pointed out that if Pakistan follows the actions of the United States and Britain against the Republic of Iraq, it will bring "disastrous consequences" to Pakistan.
    "Today's News" published an article on the 20th saying, "The recent practice in the Middle East has made the bankruptcy of Pakistan's foreign policy an undeniable reality. It is the result of this policy that Pakistan is completely isolated from its other Arab brothers." The newspaper said that it is reasonable for the people in Pakistan to express strong opposition to this policy.
    "Today's News"' article was written in opposition to a statement by former Pakistani Prime Minister and People's League Chairman Suhrawardy, in which Suhrawardy opposed expressing any opinion on the Middle East and US armed intervention. Many political leaders in Pakistan condemned the Western countries' intervention in the Middle East. Only Suhrawardy openly considered the revolution in Iraq a "terrible tragedy."
    The Karachi evening newspaper "Leader" said in an editorial on the 19th: "The communique issued after the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan may be considered the most disappointing and shameful document."
    The newspaper pointed out that the Pakistani government should in any case see the fact that almost all party leaders have condemned the US intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. All national newspapers except two have unanimously condemned the Western attempt to turn back the wheel of history.
    The newspaper said that the entire issue of Pakistan's foreign policy needs to be thoroughly re-evaluated, and now is the time to do so.
    The Urdu daily "Battle News" said in an editorial on the 19th that the communique issued in Ankara by the heads of the three Muslim countries of the Baghdad Pact "is more concerned with supporting the United States than with their own interests." The newspaper also said, "Pakistan's attitude towards the Middle East situation does not conform to the concept of independence and sovereignty."

    巴基斯坦舆论支持中东人民斗争
    美英帝国主义的军事行为是可耻的干涉
    很多政党领袖反对政府支持美英侵略者
    抨击巴格达条约要求承认伊拉克共和国
    本报综合报道  据新华社消息：巴基斯坦很多政党领袖和报纸纷纷谴责美英对中东的武装侵略，反对巴基斯坦政府支持美英的侵略行动，并要求政府立即承认伊拉克共和国。
    巴基斯坦国民议会议员、民族人民党领袖卡里姆要求努恩总理立即召开国民议会紧急会议，就巴基斯坦政府对中东国家的政策进行辩论。他说：“我国的民主力量应该团结一致，并且表示它们声援中东的自由战士。”他还要求政府承认伊拉克共和国，并且要求美国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩。
    这个党卡拉奇组织在18日举行的紧急会议上通过了一项决议，欢呼伊拉克共和国的诞生，认为这是进步的阿拉伯民族主义胜利的象征。会议谴责了美英两国军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆的侵略行为，认为这是“对这些国家内政的直接的、可耻的干涉”。会议要求巴基斯坦政府马上承认伊拉克共和国，要求努恩总理立即召开各党派会议讨论中东局势和巴基斯坦的外交政策，并且警告巴基斯坦政府不要采取任何片面措施，参与帝国主义国家积极干涉中东国家的内政，因为这种政策对巴基斯坦和阿拉伯人民的关系是有害的，并且是一种玩火的行为。
    这个党的总书记乌斯马尼早在15日就发表声明说，伊拉克的事态发展表明，“巴格达条约在伊拉克人民中从来没有得到过公众的任何支持。”他说：“巴格达条约直接伤害强烈的阿拉伯民族主义情绪，这种情绪在战后时期已经成为人们不能不考虑到的现象。和埃及人民一样，伊拉克人民也认为巴格达条约是一个破坏阿拉伯人民团结的预谋的行动。
    乌斯马尼说：“伊拉克成立的民族主义的新政府显然受到绝大部分伊拉克人民的信任。”他说：“我们在巴基斯坦对到处发生的这些重大事件不能采取消极的旁观态度。我们必须通过宪法手段要求巴基斯坦政府立即承认伊拉克人民的新共和国。”他说，“米尔扎总统单独做了一些根据宪法并不属于他的职权范围内的一些事情是进一步令人感到懊丧和惊讶的。”
    巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟主席加尧姆汗18日严厉谴责巴格达条约土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三个穆斯林国家的首脑在安卡拉发表的公报。
    他说：“不准把我们的军队派出国。我们不能让我们自己干帝国主义的勾当。”
    加尧姆汗警告政府，不要奉行支持西方国家继续使阿拉伯民族陷于分裂、并阻止阿拉伯民族主义日益高涨的浪潮的政策，因为这会引起危险的后果。
    人民联盟主席阿赫塔尔·阿里汗17日发表谈话说，巴基斯坦的命运应当由全国人民决定。“没有一个执政的或在野的个人或者政党有权把巴基斯坦的命运去作赌注。”
    拉合尔共和党、人民联盟、民族人民党、穆斯林联盟等七个不同政党的九名领袖18日提出要求说，巴基斯坦政府应该立即承认伊拉克共和国。这些领袖在拉合尔发表的联合声明中，保证他们全力支持中东人民的反帝斗争。并且认为，根据任何法律和道义的原则，美军在黎巴嫩登陆都是没有道理的。他们还要求联合国安全理会事制止西方国家干涉中东。声明说，令人遗憾的是，最近在土耳其结束的巴格达条约会议上，巴基斯坦对西方的行动竟表示支持。
    此外，巴基斯坦宗教界著名领袖大毛拉巴达尤尼发表谈话说，充分尊重穆斯林世界的愿望是巴基斯坦政府的义务。他警告政府不要在中东采取任何轻率的措施。
    卡拉奇的六十三个律师18日晚间联名要求卡拉奇律师协会召开大会，以抗议美英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦的干涉。他们还要求巴基斯坦政府承认伊拉克共和国。
    除了两家报纸以外，其余的报纸都谴责了美国和英国对中东国家人民进行武装干涉，并且要求政府改变它的外交政策。
      “卡拉奇时报”批评了认为巴基斯坦应该履行巴格达条约加在它身上的义务的主张。这家报纸指出，如果巴基斯坦追随美英两国反对伊拉克共和国的行动，就将给巴基斯坦“带来灾难性的后果”。
      “今天报”20日发表文章说，“最近中东的实践已经使巴基斯坦外交政策的破产成为无可否认的现实。正是这种政策的结果使巴基斯坦完全同其他阿拉伯兄弟隔绝开来”。这家报纸说，巴基斯坦国内人民对这种政策表示强烈的反对是合理的。
      “今天报”的文章是为了反对巴基斯坦前总理人民联盟主席苏拉瓦底的声明而写的，苏拉瓦底在声明中反对就中东和美国武装干涉问题发表任何意见。巴基斯坦的许多政界领袖都谴责西方国家干涉中东。只有苏拉瓦底公开认为伊拉克的革命是“可怕的悲剧”。
    卡拉奇晚报“领袖报”19日在社论中说：“土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦三国国家首脑在会谈以后所发表的公报也许要算是最令人失望和最可耻的文件了。”
    这家报纸指出，巴基斯坦政府无论如何应该看到这个事实：几乎所有政党的领袖都谴责了美国干涉黎巴嫩内政的行动。全国报纸除了两家以外都一致谴责了西方想扭转历史车轮的企图。
    这家报纸说，巴基斯坦外交政策的整个问题需要彻底重新估价，现在正是这样做的时候。
    乌尔都文日报“战斗报”19日发表社论说，巴格达条约三个穆斯林国家首脑在安卡拉发表的公报，“更关心的是支持美国，而不是他们自己的利益”。这家报纸还说，“巴基斯坦对中东局势所采取的态度是不符合独立和主权这种概念的。”
