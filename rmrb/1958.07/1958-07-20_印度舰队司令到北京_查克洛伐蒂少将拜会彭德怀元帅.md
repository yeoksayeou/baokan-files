Rear Admiral Chakravarti, commander of the Indian fleet, who led the Indian flagship "Mysore" on a visit to Shanghai, China, along with his wife and Captain Nanda of the "Mysore," and five others, arrived in Beijing by special plane from Shanghai at 9:10 this morning.

Those who welcomed them at the airport included Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Rear Admiral Yuan Yeilie, and others.

Personnel from the Indian Embassy and military attaches from various countries in China also welcomed them at the airport.

Accompanying Rear Admiral Chakravarti to Beijing were Kannampilly, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Indian Embassy in China, Brigadier General Sharma, Military Attaché, Colonel Zhu Kaiyin, Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, and Colonel Zhang Tong, Military Attaché of China in India.

Xinhua News Agency, July 19th. Rear Admiral Chakravarti, commander of the Indian fleet, and Captain Nanda of the Indian flagship "Mysore," accompanied by Brigadier General Sharma, the Indian Military Attaché in China, paid a visit to Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of China, at 5:00 p.m. today.

Marshal Peng Dehuai had a cordial conversation with Rear Admiral Chakravarti and others. Marshal Peng Dehuai said: The era of American imperialism running rampant in the world will not last long. Recently, its troops invaded and occupied Lebanon, which has been opposed by many countries. Britain's invasion of Jordan, in partnership with the United States, violates the will of the British people.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, referring to the people across the country who have been marching and demonstrating to protest against the American and British imperialist aggression against Middle Eastern countries, said that China has long been subjected to imperialist aggression in the past, so the Chinese people naturally sympathize with countries subjected to imperialist aggression.

Those present during the visit included General Zhang Aiping, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Vice Admiral Fang Qiang, and Colonel Zhang Tong, Military Attaché of China in India.

At 11:30 a.m., Rear Admiral Chakravarti and Captain Nanda also paid a visit to Admiral Xiao Jingguang, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy. (Photo attached)
