    The Chinese People Will Always Support the People of the Middle East
    Supporting the Struggle of Arab Brothers with Practical Actions
    American and British imperialism are unwilling to accept the fact that the people of Iraq have shattered the shackles of colonialism and achieved freedom and independence. They are resorting to desperate measures, using armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan to threaten the just struggle of the Iraqi people and the entire Middle East. This has aroused our boundless anger. We lodge the strongest protest against the bandit behavior of the United States and Britain. Any excuse of American and British imperialism is untenable and cannot conceal their ferocious jackal nature. We firmly believe that the righteous people will achieve the final victory. We fully support the statements issued by the governments of China and the Soviet Union, demanding that the American and British invading troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan. We are determined to support our fraternal Arab people with practical actions by implementing the general line of socialist construction and further developing the technical innovation movement to overfulfill the state plan.

    On an Angry Train
    We, the 163 teachers and students of the Taiyuan Institute of Technology's Support Yabei Cultural and Technological Revolution Work Team, are speeding across the fields of the motherland on a train. The scene of a bountiful harvest excites the hearts of each of us. But when we heard that American imperialism openly violated the United Nations Charter, disregarded the righteous condemnation of the people of the world, and brazenly sent armed forces to carry out a shameful intervention in Lebanon, we could not suppress the anger in our hearts and could not help but raise our serious protest. Together with the passengers, we condemned the imperialist atrocities, and we turned our train into an angry protest train.
    The 600 million Chinese people who have stood up are now breaking down superstitions and conservatism with soaring enthusiasm, and are engaged in great labor to catch up with Britain in a short period of time. However, the Chinese people will not forget the painful life under imperialist enslavement, so when we learned that American imperialism invaded Lebanon in an attempt to suppress the national independence movement of the Arab people, we felt completely intolerable.
    All the teachers and students of our Taiyuan Institute of Technology Work Team will complete all the tasks assigned to us by the Party with practical actions. We will complete this surveying task in a fighting posture, with full energy, striving for excellence, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, as a way to support the revolutionary struggle of the Iraqi people and to strike at the aggressive actions of imperialism.

    We Cannot Sit Idly By While the People of Lebanon and Jordan Suffer Aggression
    We are forest survey workers. We are currently working hard in the deep mountains and dense forests of the southwest of our motherland. Although we are in the remote border areas of the motherland, our hearts are closely linked with Beijing, with the people of the whole country, and with peace-loving people all over the world. We are working day and night to build a beautiful socialist motherland. When the world situation is in a state where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind and peace prevails over war, the claws of American and British imperialists have stretched into Lebanon and Jordan. This news aroused great anger in our hearts. We love peace and oppose war, but we are not afraid of war. We strongly protest against the aggressive acts of American and British imperialists! We solemnly warn the imperialists that they should learn from the lessons of invading Korea and Egypt, immediately stop their aggression, and get out of Lebanon and Jordan! We absolutely cannot sit idly by while the people of the Middle East suffer the disasters of aggressive war. If American and British warmongers do not recognize the times and dare to continue to act perversely and run rampant, they will only be hitting a stone with an egg, breaking their heads and shedding blood, and being smashed to pieces.

    We Cannot Ignore This Barbaric Act of Aggression
    At a time when people all over the world are eagerly demanding peace and opposing war, American and British imperialism dare to carry out armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to interfere in the newly established Republic of Iraq. We are indignant! We protest! We firmly support the statement of our government. The American and British imperialist aggressor troops must get out immediately! American imperialism's claim to "protect overseas Chinese" and "care about the integrity and independence of Lebanon" is complete nonsense. It is a trick commonly used by colonialists and can absolutely not conceal their jackal faces. As everyone knows, American imperialism still occupies our sacred territory of Taiwan to this day. We clearly know that American imperialism is the root cause of all disasters in the world and the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people. We, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the people of the whole country, cannot ignore this barbaric act of aggression by imperialism. We are willing to do everything in our power to support the struggle of the Arab people for national independence.

    No U.S. and British Collusion to Invade the Middle East!
    American and British imperialists are colluding and attempting to extinguish the sacred flame of the great Arab people's struggle for freedom and independence, and to undermine peace in Asia, Africa and the world. We express our extreme anger at this! We solemnly warn the American and British aggressors that if you do not learn from the series of shameful failures in the past, such as the invasion of Korea and Egypt, and immediately stop the armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and the threat to Iraq, you will suffer an even more shameful failure, and the Middle East will become the grave where you are buried.
    The Chinese people have long been subjected to imperialist aggression and oppression, so we have the deepest brotherly sympathy for the struggle of the people of the Middle East. We believe that the struggle of the Arab people is our struggle. All teachers, students and staff of Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School support the just struggle of the Arab people with unparalleled enthusiasm, and express our serious protest against the aggressive actions of American and British imperialism with great anger. And we once again warn you to immediately stop your war provocations, otherwise, you will reap what you sow and bring destruction upon yourselves!

    Protest Against American and British Provocations to World Peace
    When we, all the staff members of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, heard the news of the American armed intervention in Lebanon and the British troops' invasion of Jordan, we felt extremely angry and immediately held a meeting to discuss it. Everyone agreed that this was the greatest provocation to world peace. We firmly support the solemn statement of our government, protest against the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain, and will never allow them to interfere in the just struggle of the Arab people for independence and freedom. We are determined to fully support the just cause of the Arab people, defend world peace, and severely strike at the American and British aggressors.

    We Absolutely Cannot Tolerate It
    We are a group of medical students who are currently interning in the rural areas of our great motherland. Our task is to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eliminate diseases. We are contributing our efforts to human health. When we heard that the evil American imperialism once again launched an armed invasion of Lebanon and British troops also invaded Jordan, threatening world peace, our anger was uncontrollable. We are fighting day and night to protect human life, but American and British imperialism are dragging people to the brink of war and death. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate!
    We loudly protest: American and British imperialism must immediately stop the aggression against Lebanon and Jordan! Must get out of the Middle East! We, a group of young medical students, and the entire Chinese people will always stand with the Arab people and fight together against aggressive war and defend world peace! We firmly believe that the final victory belongs to the glorious people who are fighting for justice.

    Standing Together with the Lebanese Children
    I read in the newspaper that American imperialism landed in Lebanon and British imperialism invaded Jordan, threatening the Republic of Iraq, which is striving for independence and freedom, and I felt very angry! This news will surely arouse the anger of thousands upon thousands of children all over the world. The people of the whole world will never agree to their arrogant aggression. We want to warn British and American imperialism that if they do not immediately withdraw their troops, the people will send them to their graves.
    I am a Young Pioneer. I saw the pledge of the Lebanese child in the orange shirt on page of the "People's Daily" on the 17th: "We are Arabs, we will definitely beat them back!" I firmly express that I want to stand with the Lebanese children and shout: American and British imperialism get out of the Middle Eastern countries! Support the just struggle of the Arab people!

    Stop the Imperialists' Mad Provocation
    When we heard the news of the American and British invading troops invading Lebanon and Jordan, we felt very indignant. American and British imperialism, braving the great disapproval of the world, are using armed force to interfere in the national independence movement of the people of the Middle East, threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. This is a mad provocation against the people of the whole world, and it is also their dying struggle. We Chinese people love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We shout: Resolutely protest against the armed intervention of American and British imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan! We are determined to support the struggle of the people of the Middle East with all our strength!

    Chop Off the Claws of American and British Imperialism!
    American and British imperialism has torn off its masks and revealed its true jackal face to the people of the world. This shows how panicked the imperialists are about the increasingly high tide of the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of the Middle East.
    The just struggle of the people of the Middle East has been supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The economic crisis within imperialism is becoming increasingly serious, and the colonial rule on which imperialism depends is disintegrating. American and British imperialism playing with fire will surely burn themselves!
    We firmly support the Arab people standing on the front line of the struggle against colonialism, and fully support their just struggle. We firmly warn American and British imperialism, get out of the Middle East!

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    以实际行动支援阿拉伯兄弟的斗争
    美英帝国主义不甘心伊拉克人民打碎殖民主义的枷锁、取得自由和独立，他们狗急跳墙，以武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦，来威胁伊拉克人民以及整个中东人民的正义斗争，这激起了我们无比的愤怒。我们对美英的强盗行为提出最强硬的抗议。美英帝国主义的任何借口，都是站不住脚的，丝毫不能掩盖住它们穷凶极恶的豺狼本相。我们深信，正义的人民一定会取得最后的胜利，我们完全拥护中苏两国政府发表的声明，要求美英侵略军队立即滚出黎巴嫩和约旦。我们坚决以贯彻建设社会主义总路线，进一步开展技术革新运动，超额完成国家计划的实际行动，来支援兄弟般的阿拉伯人民。

    在愤怒的列车上
    我们太原工学院支援雁北文化技术革命工作大队一百六十三名师生，正乘着列车飞奔在祖国的田野上。一片丰收的景象激动着我们每个人的心。但是当我们听到美帝国主义公然违反联合国宪章，不顾全世界人民的正义斥责，竟派遣武装部队对黎巴嫩进行可耻的干涉时，我们压不住心里的怒火，禁不住要提出我们严重的抗议。我们同旅客们一起同声斥责帝国主义的侵略兽行，我们把我们的列车变成一个愤怒的抗议的列车。
    已经站起来的中国六亿人民，现在正以冲天的干劲，打破迷信保守，为在短期内赶上英国而从事着伟大的劳动。但是，中国人民不会忘记在帝国主义奴役下的痛苦生活，因此当我们知道美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩，企图镇压阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动时，感到完全不能容忍。
    我们太原工学院工作大队全体师生，将以实际的行动完成党赋予我们的一切任务，我们要以战斗的姿态，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地完成这次测量任务，以此作为声援伊拉克人民的革命斗争和对帝国主义的侵略行动的打击。

    不能坐视黎巴嫩、约旦人民遭受侵略
    我们是森林调查工作者。目前正在祖国西南的深山密林中紧张地劳动着。我们虽然在祖国遥远的边疆，但是我们的心是同北京、同全国人民和全世界爱好和平的人们紧密地联结在一起的。我们正夜以继日地加紧建设着美好的社会主义祖国。当世界局势正处于东风压倒西风、和平压倒战争的时候，美英帝国主义者的魔爪又伸入了黎巴嫩和约旦。这个消息激起我们内心极大的愤怒。我们热爱和平，反对战争，但是我们绝不惧怕战争。我们强烈抗议美英帝国主义者的侵略行为！我们严正警告帝国主义者，应当接受侵略朝鲜和埃及的教训，立即停止侵略行动，从黎巴嫩、约旦滚回去！我们绝不能坐视中东人民遭受侵略战争的灾难。美英战争狂人如不识时务，胆敢继续倒行逆施，横行霸道，只会是以卵击石，碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨。

    对这种野蛮的侵略行为，不能置之不理
    在世界人民都热烈要求和平，反对战争的今天，美英帝国主义胆敢武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，企图干涉刚成立的伊拉克共和国。我们愤慨！我们抗议！我们坚决拥护我国政府的声明。美英帝国主义侵略军必须立即滚出去！美帝国主义说什么“保护侨民”，“关心黎巴嫩的完整和独立”，这完全是胡说，是殖民主义者惯用的伎俩，绝对掩饰不了它们的豺狼面目。众所周知，美帝国主义直到今天仍然侵占着我国的神圣领土台湾。我们清楚地知道美帝国主义是世界上一切灾难的总祸根，是一切爱好和平的人民的死敌。我们中国人民解放军的战士同全国人民一样，对帝国主义这种野蛮的侵略行为不能置之不理。我们愿尽一切力量支援阿拉伯人民争取民族独立的斗争。

    不许美英狼狈为奸侵略中东！
    美英帝国主义者狼狈为奸，企图扑灭伟大的阿拉伯人民争取自由独立的神圣火焰，破坏亚非及全世界的和平，我们对此表示无比愤怒！我们庄严地正告美英侵略者，如果你们不从过去侵朝、侵埃等一系列可耻的失败中吸取教训，立即停止对黎巴嫩、约旦的武装侵略和对伊拉克的威胁，你们就会遭到更可耻的失败，中东就成为埋葬你们的坟墓。
    我们中国人民过去长期受帝国主义的侵略压迫，因此对中东人民的斗争，有着最深切的兄弟般的同情，我们认为阿拉伯人民的斗争就是我们的斗争。我们北京第三女子中学全体师生员工，以无比的热情声援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，并以极大的愤怒向美英帝国主义的侵略行为提出严重的抗议，而且再一次警告你们，应立即停止战争挑衅行为，否则，必自食其果，自取灭亡！

    抗议美英对世界和平的挑衅
    我们中国科学院考古研究所全体工作人员，听到美国武装干涉黎巴嫩、英军侵入约旦的消息后，感到无比的愤怒，立即集会座谈，大家一致认为这是对世界和平的最大挑衅。我们坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明，抗议美英的侵略行为，绝不允许他们干涉阿拉伯人民争取独立自由的正义斗争。我们决心全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义事业，保卫世界和平，予美英侵略者以严重打击。

    我们绝对不能容忍
    我们是一群正在自己伟大祖国的农村中进行实习的医学生。我们的任务是除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病。我们在为人类的健康而贡献出自己的力量。当我们听到万恶的美帝国主义又一次向黎巴嫩发动武装侵略、英军也侵入约旦，威胁世界和平的时候，我们的愤怒是无法抑制的。我们日夜在为保卫人类的生命而战斗，而美英帝国主义却把人民拖向战争和死亡的边缘，这是我们绝对不能容忍的！
    我们大声抗议：美英帝国主义必须立即停止对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略！必须滚出中东去！我们一群年青的医学生们和全中国人民永远同阿拉伯人民站在一起，为反对侵略战争保卫世界和平而共同斗争！我们深信最后的胜利是属于光荣的为正义而战斗的人民的。

    和黎巴嫩小朋友站在一起
    我从报上看到美帝国主义在黎巴嫩登陆、英帝国主义侵略约旦，威胁争取独立自由的伊拉克共和国的消息，感到很气愤！这个消息也一定会引起全世界千千万万小朋友的愤怒。全世界的人民决不答应他们这样狂妄的侵略。我们要警告英美帝国主义，如果他们不立即撤回军队，那人民就会把他们送入坟墓。
    我是一个少先队员，我看到17日“人民日报”上登载的那个穿着桔黄色衬衫的黎巴嫩小朋友的誓言：“我们是阿拉伯人，我们一定把他们打回去！”我坚决表示要和黎巴嫩小朋友站在一起，高呼：美英帝国主义滚出中东国家！支援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争！

    制止帝国主义的疯狂挑衅
    当我们听到美英侵略军侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的消息后，感到非常愤慨。美英帝国主义甘冒天下之大不韪，武装干涉中东人民的民族独立运动，威胁中东和世界和平，这是对全世界人民的疯狂挑衅，也是它们的垂死挣扎。我们中国人民是爱好和平的，但是也不怕战争，我们高呼：坚决抗议美英帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦！我们决心以一切力量支援中东人民的斗争！

    中东人民的正义斗争，已经得到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，帝国主义内部的经济危机正日趋严重，帝国主义所赖以支持的殖民统治正在分崩瓦解，美英帝国主义玩火，必将自焚！
    我们坚决支持站在反对殖民主义斗争前线的阿拉伯人民，全力支援他们的正义斗争。我们坚决警告美英帝国主义，滚出中东去！
