The myth that aluminum smelting must use electrolysis is shattered.
Chongqing uses indigenous methods to smelt metallic aluminum.

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 30th dispatch) The employees of the Nantong Mining Area in Chongqing have successfully smelted metallic aluminum using indigenous methods. This fact shatters the myth that aluminum smelting must use electrolysis and pioneers a new example in the aluminum smelting industry.

Under the leadership of Wu Yi, the Secretary of the Nantong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, some employees from the Nantong and Donglin coal mines and the 103rd Metal Smelting Plant used alum shale, soda, and lime, and burned them at a high temperature of 1,200 degrees to produce semi-finished metallic aluminum – alumina – at the end of June.

To smelt metallic aluminum, the oxygen in the alumina must be removed. However, alumina requires a high temperature of 2,050 degrees to melt, and the highest temperature of the indigenous furnace is only 1,240 degrees, which cannot melt the alumina. They successively adopted nine methods and failed after more than twenty trials. Later, someone thought: Can we find a way to reduce the melting point of alumina? They thought of making aluminum sulfide from alumina and then refining metallic aluminum. Because aluminum sulfide only needs a temperature of 1,100 degrees to melt. They added iron sulfide and coke to the alumina and burned it to about 1,000 degrees to produce aluminum sulfide. In the process of experimenting with extracting metallic aluminum from aluminum sulfide, Bai Shucheng, a worker transferred from the Chongqing Metal Processing Cooperative to the 103rd Factory to participate in the experiment, proposed adding zinc chloride to the aluminum sulfide and roasting it together, based on his past experience in smelting waste aluminum. On July 18th, the 103rd Factory conducted an experiment on the indigenous furnace according to this method, and silvery metallic aluminum was extracted. After inspection, the quality was good. At present, the Nantong and Donglin coal mines have begun to build semi-finished metallic aluminum plants with annual outputs of 40,000 tons and 20,000 tons, and are selecting sites to prepare for the construction of metallic aluminum smelting plants.

At present, all countries in the world use electrolysis to smelt metallic aluminum; one ton of aluminum consumes at least 18,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and the equipment is very complicated. The aluminum content of alum shale in the Nantong Mining Area is only 30% on average, and according to written materials, it has no smelting value. Therefore, although the reserve of alum shale in this mining area is as high as 34.7 million tons, people have dumped the alum shale mined with coal as "slag" year after year. According to the needs of the great development of industry and agriculture, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chongqing Municipal Committee decided to vigorously develop the aluminum smelting industry and repeatedly encouraged employees to boldly study indigenous smelting methods and break the superstition that "aluminum smelting must use electrolysis and the equipment scale must be large." Nearly forty cadres and workers participated in this experiment, and none of them had smelted aluminum. However, after a month of hard work, they finally found an aluminum smelting method that had never been seen in books and required very simple equipment.

### 炼铝必须电解的迷信打破了  重庆用土法炼出金属铝

    炼铝必须电解的迷信打破了
    重庆用土法炼出金属铝
    本报重庆30日电　重庆南桐矿区职工用土法冶炼金属铝成功。这一事实打破了炼铝必须电解的迷信，开创了炼铝工业的新例。
    南桐矿区的南桐、东林两个煤矿和103金属冶炼厂三个单位的部分职工，在中共南桐区委书记武毅率领下，在6月底用铝土页岩加上苏打和石灰，放在一千二百度高温下烧炼，制成了金属铝的半成品——氧化铝。
    炼金属铝要把氧化铝中的氧去掉。但是氧化铝需要二千零五十度的高温才能熔解，土炉子最高的温度不过一千二百四十度，不能熔解氧化铝。他们先后采用了九种办法，经过二十几次试验都没有成功。后来有人想：能不能设法降低氧化铝的熔解度呢？他们便想到把氧化铝制成硫化铝以后再提炼金属铝。因为硫化铝只需要一千一百度的温度即可熔解。他们把氧化铝加上硫化铁和焦炭，烧到一千度左右，就制成了硫化铝。在试验从硫化铝提炼金属铝的过程中，从重庆金属加工社调到103厂参加试验工作的工人白树成，根据过去炼废铝的经验，提出在硫化铝中加氯化锌一起焙烧。7月18日，103厂按照这个办法在土炉子上进行试验，银光闪闪的金属铝便提炼出来了。经过检验，质量良好。目前，南桐和东林两个煤矿都开始兴建年产四万吨和两万吨的金属铝半成品厂，并且在选择厂址准备兴建冶炼金属铝厂。
    世界各国目前都是用电解法冶炼金属铝；一吨铝最低也要耗用一万八千度电，设备也很复杂。南桐矿区铝土页岩的含铝量平均只有30％，按照成书资料，没有冶炼价值。因此，这个矿区的铝土页岩蕴藏量虽达三千四百七十万吨之多，但是人们年复一年地都把随煤开采出来的铝土页岩当“矿渣”倒掉。中共四川省委及重庆市委根据工农业大发展的需要，决定大力发展炼铝工业，并且一再鼓励职工大胆研究土法冶炼，破除“炼铝必须电解，设备规模庞大”的迷信。参加这项试验工作的将近四十名干部和工人，没有人炼过铝。但他们经过一月苦战，终于找到了书本上从来没有过而设备很简便的炼铝办法。
