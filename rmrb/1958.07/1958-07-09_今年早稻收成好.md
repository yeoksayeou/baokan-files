Good Early Rice Harvest This Year

	The sun shines on the Youjiang,
	Golden light flashes everywhere in the rice paddies,
	This year's early rice harvest is good,
	The people of Youjiang are full of joy.

	The wind blows the sea and stirs up waves,
	Harvesting is busy on both sides of the Youjiang,
	The sound of sickles cutting rice echoes,
	Every ear of grain is big and long.

	The Youjiang River surges on,
	The rice seedlings grow as tall as people,
	This year's early rice harvest is good,
	Piles of grain are higher than mountains.

	Songs of harvest spread everywhere,
	The people of Youjiang are so happy,
	This year's early rice harvest is good,
	Every household's granary is full.
		(Youjiang Folk Song)

    今年早稻收成好
    太阳照在右江上，
    遍地稻谷闪金光，
    今年早稻收成好，
    右江人民喜洋洋。
    风吹大海起波浪，
    右江两岸收割忙，
    镰刀割稻察察响，
    根根谷穗大又长。
    右江河水浪滔滔，
    禾苗长得似人高，
    今年早稻收成好，
    谷子堆堆比山高。
    丰收歌声遍地传，
    右江人民好喜欢，
    今年早稻收成好，
    家家户户谷满仓。
          （右江民歌）
