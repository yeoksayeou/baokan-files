Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th. According to TASS, New York, July 24th: The American "Time" magazine recently stated in an article that Latin American countries tend to be neutral. The magazine recently conducted polls in several Latin American capitals, asking: "In the event of a conflict between East and West, will your country side with the West, or will it stand aside?" The magazine pointed out that "those conducting the poll tried hard to obtain answers from people from all socio-economic strata in order to understand what Latin America thinks of the United States since Vice President Nixon was stoned in Lima and Caracas... On the question of East, West, or neutrality, Latin Americans in the capitals, with the exception of Lima, overwhelmingly expressed support for the tempting position of neutrality."

"Time" magazine continued, "Those conducting the poll asked them to answer whether the United States is trying to establish economic dominance in Latin America for its own benefit? Most people said, yes."

    美“时代”杂志的民意测验证明
    拉丁美洲倾向中立
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约24日讯：美国“时代”杂志最近在一篇文章中说，拉丁美洲国家倾向中立。这家杂志最近曾在几个拉丁美洲国家的首都进行了民意测验，问题是：“当东西方发生冲突时，你们国家将站在西方这一边，还是将袖手旁观？”杂志指出，“主持测验的人竭力希望从一切社会经济阶层人士获得答复，以便弄清楚，拉丁美洲自从副总统尼克松在利马和加拉加斯遭到石块的投击后对美国是怎么想的……在关于东方、西方、或者中立的问题上，各首都的拉丁美洲人，除了利马以外，绝大多数表示赞成诱惑人的中立地位。”
    “时代”周刊继续说，“主持测验的人要他们回答，美国是不是为了自己的利益企图在拉丁美洲建立经济统治？大多数人说，是的”。
