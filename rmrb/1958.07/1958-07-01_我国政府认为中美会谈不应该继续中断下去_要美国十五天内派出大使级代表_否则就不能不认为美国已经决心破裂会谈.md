Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China Regarding the Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks, June 30, 1958

The US government has interrupted the Sino-US ambassadorial talks for more than half a year, and the Chinese government believes that this situation should not continue. The US ruling clique has exhausted all means to try to maintain the illusion of Sino-US talks in order to cover up its activities of continuing to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and creating international tension. This conspiracy must never be allowed to succeed. The Chinese government agreed to hold Sino-US ambassadorial talks in order to solve problems. The US government should give a clear answer as to whether it has the sincerity to negotiate.

Since December 12, 1957, when the US government undermined the agreement between China and the US on holding ambassadorial talks, refused to send an ambassador-level representative, and interrupted the talks, the Chinese side has repeatedly urged the US government to send an ambassador-level representative to resume the talks on January 14 and March 26, 1958. However, the US government refused to send an ambassador-level representative, and they did not even think it necessary to reply to the Chinese side's letter of March 26. Not only that, but a spokesman for the US State Department recently said nonchalantly that their First Secretary was ready to negotiate with us at any time, as if there had been no agreement between China and the US on holding ambassadorial talks. This situation cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people.

The course of nearly three years of Sino-US ambassadorial talks has shown that this imperialist attitude of the US is consistent. The US occupies China's territory of Taiwan, creating tension in the Taiwan area. This is a naked act of aggression against China, and the Chinese people have every right to take all measures to repel this aggression. However, in order to ease the tension in the Taiwan area, the Chinese side is still willing to sit down and negotiate with the US, and has put forward a series of reasonable proposals for the peaceful settlement of international disputes between China and the US in the Taiwan area in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks. However, the US side rejected all these proposals. They attempted to confuse the internal affairs of China between the Chinese government and the Taiwan local authorities with the international disputes between China and the US in the Taiwan area, demanding that China abandon its right to exercise sovereignty over its own territory and recognize the US's right to conduct "self-defense" on China's territory. This clearly shows that the purpose of the US is by no means to ease the tension in the Taiwan area, but to ask China to recognize the status quo of the US occupation of Taiwan and maintain and aggravate the tension. This imperialist policy of the US has brought the discussion of this key issue in Sino-US relations to a standstill since the second half of 1956.

In order to break the deadlock and gradually improve Sino-US relations, the Chinese side has put forward a series of suggestions on issues that are relatively easy to resolve, such as eliminating trade barriers between the two countries, eliminating obstacles to people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries, reciprocal news coverage by journalists from both countries on an equal footing, and judicial assistance between the two countries. Although issues such as journalist interviews and judicial assistance were first raised by the US relevant parties to the Chinese relevant parties, and all the Chinese proposals were in full compliance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the US government still rejected these Chinese proposals. What is particularly intolerable is that the US, regardless of the agreement reached by both sides in 1955 on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, still detains thousands of Chinese civilians in the US and does not allow them to return to their motherland.

The irrefutable facts prove that what the US is pursuing in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks is by no means a peaceful settlement of international disputes between China and the US on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, but to impose its imperialist intentions on the Chinese people. When this intention cannot be realized, it uses the Sino-US ambassadorial talks to deceive the people of the world and cover up its conspiracy to continue to invade China and create international tension. For three years, the US has continuously strengthened its intervention and control over all aspects of Taiwan, established missile bases in Taiwan to threaten the Chinese people, and used the Taiwan reactionary group to carry out subversive activities and armed interference in Southeast Asian countries. At the same time, the US has also instigated the creation of a "two Chinas" situation in many international conferences and international organizations, in an attempt to gradually form a fait accompli of "two Chinas" internationally, so as to achieve its goal of long-term occupation of Taiwan. This is the crux of the failure to make progress in the Sino-US ambassadorial talks. Recently, US Secretary of State Dulles openly clamored that the US insists on its policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China. This policy is the highest interest of the US, and the US will deal with China when its interests require it. This clearly shows that, as far as the intentions of the US ruling group are concerned, the Sino-US ambassadorial talks are merely a tool to serve the US imperialist policy. China agreed to hold Sino-US ambassadorial talks in order to strive to eliminate the US's use of armed aggression and armed threats in the Taiwan area by peaceful means. However, the Chinese people are by no means afraid of US aggression. Still less do they care about negotiations with the US. The Chinese people, who are building socialism at a flying speed, are fully capable of liberating their own territory of Taiwan. The great cause of the Chinese people to build and unify their motherland cannot be stopped by any force. The policy of a handful of US imperialists to be hostile to the 600 million Chinese people can only make themselves isolated and defeated.

The Chinese government reiterates that the Chinese government can neither agree to unilaterally change the level of the Sino-US ambassadorial talks, nor can it agree to continue to interrupt the talks for any administrative reasons. The Chinese government demands that the US government send an ambassador-level representative within fifteen days from today to resume the talks. Otherwise, the Chinese government cannot but consider that the US has decided to rupture the Sino-US ambassadorial talks.

    我国政府认为中美会谈不应该继续中断下去
    要美国十五天内派出大使级代表
    否则就不能不认为美国已经决心破裂会谈
    新华社30日讯　中华人民共和国政府关于中美大使级会谈的声明1958年6月30日
    美国政府中断中美大使级会谈已经半年多了，中国政府认为，这种情况不应该再继续下去。美国统治集团耍尽各种手段，企图保持中美会谈的假象，来掩盖它继续侵占中国领土台湾、制造国际紧张局势的活动。这种阴谋绝不容许得逞。中国政府是为了解决问题而同意举行中美大使级会谈的。究竟有无谈判诚意，美国政府应该作出明确回答。
    自从1957年12月12日美国政府破坏中美双方关于举行大使级会谈的协议、拒绝派遣大使级代表、使会谈中断以来，中国方面在1958年1月14日和3月26日一再催促美国政府派遣大使级代表，恢复会谈。但是，美国政府拒不派出大使级代表，他们甚至认为连答复3月26日中国方面的去信的必要也没有。不仅如此，美国国务院发言人最近还若无其事地说，他们的一等秘书准备随时同我们谈判，好像中美之间并没有过关于举行大使级谈判的协议似的。这种情况不能不引起中国人民的愤慨。
    将近三年的中美大使级会谈的经过表明了美国这种帝国主义态度是一贯的。美国侵占中国领土台湾，造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。这是对于中国的一种赤裸裸的侵略行为，中国人民完全有权利采取一切措施来击退这种侵略。但是，为了和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，中国方面仍然表示愿意坐下来同美国谈判，并且在中美大使级会谈中提出了一系列和平解决中美在台湾地区的国际争端的合理建议。可是美国方面拒绝了所有这些建议。他们企图把中国政府同台湾地方当局之间的中国内政问题和中美两国在台湾地区的国际争端混为一谈，要求中国放弃对自己的领土行使主权的权利，承认美国有权在中国的领土上进行“自卫”。这就清楚地表明了，美国的目的决不是和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，而是要求中国承认美国侵占台湾的现状，保持和加剧紧张局势。美国这种帝国主义政策，使会谈对于中美关系中这一关键问题的讨论从1956年下半年起就陷于停顿状态。
    为了打开僵局和逐步改善中美关系，中国方面又在关于消除两国之间贸易障碍、关于消除两国人民来往和文化交流的障碍、关于两国记者在平等互惠基础上相互进行新闻采访和关于两国进行司法协助等比较容易解决的问题上，提出了一系列的建议。尽管像记者采访和司法协助这些问题是美国有关方面首先向中国有关方面提出的，而中国方面的所有建议又都是完全合乎平等互利的原则的，美国政府仍然拒绝了中国方面的这些建议。尤其令人不能容忍的是，美国不顾双方在1955年达成的关于平民回国问题的协议，至今还扣留着成千上万的在美国的中国平民，不让他们回到自己的祖国。
    无可辩驳的事实证明，美国在中美大使级会谈中所追求的决不是在互相尊重领土主权的平等基础上和平解决中美间的国际争端，而是要把它的帝国主义意图强加在中国人民头上。当这种意图不能实现的时候，它就利用中美大使级会谈来欺骗世界人民，掩盖它继续侵略中国、制造国际紧张局势的阴谋。三年以来，美国不断加强对台湾各方面的干预和控制，在台湾建立导弹基地威胁中国人民，并且利用台湾反动集团对东南亚国家进行颠覆活动和武装干涉。同时，美国还在许多国际会议和国际组织中策动制造“两个中国”的局面，以图在国际上逐渐形成“两个中国”的既成事实，达到它长期霸占台湾的目的。这就是中美大使级会谈不能取得进展的症结所在。最近，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开扬言，美国坚持敌视中华人民共和国的政策。这个政策是美国的最高利益，当美国的利益需要的时候，美国便向中国打交道。这就再清楚不过地表明，对于美国统治集团的意图说来，中美大使级会谈只不过是服务于美国帝国主义政策的一个工具罢了。中国同意举行中美大使级会谈是为了争取用和平方法消除美国在台湾地区使用的武力侵略和武力威胁。但是，中国人民绝不害怕美国的侵略。更不稀罕同美国的谈判。正在以飞跃的速度建设社会主义的中国人民完全有力量解放自己的领土台湾。中国人民建设和统一自己祖国的伟大事业是没有任何力量可以阻挡的，一小撮美国帝国主义分子敌视六万万中国人民的政策，只能使他们自己陷于孤立和失败。
    中国政府再次声明，中国政府既不能同意片面改变中美大使级会谈的水平，也不能同意用任何行政性理由使会谈继续中断。中国政府要求美国政府在从今天起的十五日以内派出大使级代表，恢复会谈。否则，中国政府就不能不认为美国已经决心破裂中美大使级会谈。
