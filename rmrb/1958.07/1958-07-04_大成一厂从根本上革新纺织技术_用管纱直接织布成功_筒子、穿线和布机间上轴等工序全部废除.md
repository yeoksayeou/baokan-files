Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd. The Dachen No. 1 Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, has successfully experimented with weaving cloth directly from cheese yarn. This is another major innovation shocking the textile industry, following the factory's previous leap of taking cotton directly from the carding machine to the spinning frame.

This bold innovation fundamentally changed the operating methods of modern textile industry, eliminating the entire preparation workshop, including bobbins, warping, sizing, threading and the job of beaming on the loom. Instead, a long wooden screen with bobbins is added behind the loom. After the yarn end comes out, it goes directly to the heddle and reed for weaving after passing through a chemical sizing tank, making the loom and the spinning frame directly connected. The manufacturing process from yarn to cloth is shortened from the original twenty hours to a few minutes (only the time for transportation and yarn joining is required), and the production cost is greatly reduced.

The bold idea of weaving directly with spun yarn was proposed by Qiu Quansheng, an old worker who entered the factory at the age of twelve and is now forty-four years old. As early as the first half of last year, he proposed a rationalization proposal to directly put the bobbin on the sizing tank and fly over the warping machine. Due to the obstruction of various conservative and superstitious ideas at the time, not only was it not supported, but even the proposal was lost. Through the rectification and the Two Antis movement over the past year, especially after the publicity and implementation of the General Line, people's minds have been liberated. Therefore, he further put forward the bold suggestion of putting the cheese yarn directly on the loom. This suggestion was immediately supported by the Party organization. At the same time, the successful experiment of chemical sizing method by Shanghai State-owned No. 14 Cotton Factory solved the original unsolvable sizing problem for him. A research group led by Xia Xiuqin, the secretary of the Party branch, and engineer Cai Ruzheng, was organized to help technicians Qiu Quansheng, Pan Yongchang, Qian Deda and others to conduct special experiments. June 30th was the factory's Sunday. Everyone was unwilling to rest and worked hard overnight, and finally the experiment was successful at 4 o'clock in the morning on the Party's birthday, "July 1st".

    大成一厂从根本上革新纺织技术
    用管纱直接织布成功
    筒子、穿线和布机间上轴等工序全部废除
    新华社南京3日电  江苏省常州市公私合营大成一厂试验用管纱直接织布成功。这是这个厂把棉花从梳棉机一步跨上细纱车之后，又一震惊纺织界的重大创举。
    这个大胆的革新，根本改变了有现代纺织工业以来的操作方法，废除了包括筒子、经车、浆缸、穿线在内的整个准备车间和布机间上轴的工种，而在布机后面，加上一个挑有筒管的长木屏，纱头吐出后，经过化学浆槽，直上综筘织布，使布机和细纱车发生了直接连系、从纱到布的制造过程由原来的二十小时缩短到几分钟（只要运输和换纱接头的时间），生产成本大大降低。
    用细纱直接织布的大胆设想，是一个十二岁就进厂工作今年已有四十四岁的老工人丘全生提出的。他早在去年上半年，就提出过筒子直接上浆缸、飞越经车的合理化建议。由于当时各种各样保守思想和迷信思想的阻挠，不仅没有得到支持，甚至连建议书都遗失了。通过一年来的整风和双反运动，特别是宣传贯彻总路线以后，人们的思想得到了解放。因此他进一步提出了管纱直上布机的大胆建议。这一建议立即得到党组织的支持。同时上海国棉十四厂试验化学上浆方法的成功，又为他解决了原来无法解决的上浆问题。以党总支书记夏秀琴，工程师蔡如政为首组织了一个研究小组，帮助技工丘全生、潘永昌、钱德大等人进行专题试验。6月30日正是工厂的星期天。大家都不肯休息，连夜苦战，终于在党的生日“七一”清晨四点钟试验成功。
