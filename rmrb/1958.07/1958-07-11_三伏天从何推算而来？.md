How are the "Sanfu" days calculated?
　　Zhong Kan

　　July 12th is the beginning of this year's "Sanfu" days. The hottest days of the year in most parts of China are during the "Sanfu" period. People often say, "Minor Heat isn't hot, Major Heat is the Sanfu season."

　　How exactly are the "Sanfu" days calculated? In the Chinese lunar calendar, the third "Geng" day after the "Summer Solstice" is called "Chu Fu" (First Fu), and the fourth "Geng" day is called "Zhong Fu" (Middle Fu). The first "Geng" day after the "Start of Autumn" is called "Mo Fu" (Last Fu). The so-called "Geng" day is a method of recording days using stems and branches in the Chinese lunar calendar. The stems are the ten Heavenly Stems: Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Gui; the branches are the twelve Earthly Branches: Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, and Hai. Connecting the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches creates a sequence of days, such as Jiazi, Yichou, Bingyin, Dingmao... and so on. These sequences of days have a cycle of sixty days, repeating endlessly. This method of recording days has been used in China since the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. As for the method of recording years using stems and branches, its use began somewhat later, said to be during the Later Han Dynasty.

　　From the astronomical almanac, you can find the day sequence for the first day of the first lunar month each year, and then arrange them in order to calculate the starting dates of the Sanfu days. For example, this year the day sequence for the first day of the first lunar month is "Bingyin." From this, we can calculate that the day sequence for the Summer Solstice on the seventh day of the fifth lunar month (July 22nd in the solar calendar) is "Gengwu." Therefore, the third Geng day (there is a Geng day every ten days) is the twenty-sixth day of the fifth lunar month (July 12th in the solar calendar). The day sequence on this day is "Gengyin," so Chu Fu begins on this day. Counting to the fourth Geng day, which is "Gengzi," that is the sixth day of the sixth lunar month (July 22nd in the solar calendar), which is called "Zhong Fu." Continuing to count to the twenty-third day of the sixth lunar month (August 8th in the solar calendar), this day is the "Start of Autumn" solar term, and the day sequence is "Ding Si." Because the third day after the Ding day is the Geng day, the twenty-sixth day of the sixth lunar month (August 11th in the solar calendar) is Mo Fu.

　　The "Sanfu" period is during the height of summer in China. Its weather characteristics are that in the Jiangnan area, the plum rain season has passed, and warm and sunny southeasterly winds (summer monsoon) blow in from the sea, resulting in drought, and sometimes typhoons. As for the North China area, thunderstorms often occur on hot days, resulting in concentrated summer rain. Generally speaking, according to historical records, the daily average temperature and maximum temperature throughout the country are the highest of the year during this period.

### 三伏天从何推算而来？

    三伏天从何推算而来？
    钟侃
    7月12日，是今年三伏天的开始。在我国各地一年中最热的日子，大都是在“三伏天”。人们常说：“小暑不算热，大暑三伏天”。
    “三伏天”究竟是怎样推算来的？在我国农历中，“夏至”以后第三个庚日为“初伏”，第四个庚日为“中伏”；立秋以后头一个庚日为“末伏”。所谓庚日，也是我国农历中的一种干支纪日法。干就是甲、乙、丙、丁、戊、己、庚、辛、壬、癸十大天干；支就是子、丑、寅、卯、辰、巳、午、未、申、酉、戍、亥十二地支。把天干地支连接起来，便构成了一个日序。比如甲子、乙丑、丙寅、丁卯……等等。这些日序是以六十天为一个周期的，周而复始，没有间断。这种纪日法，自春秋战国时代以来，已在我国使用了。至于干支纪年法，使用年限稍晚一些，相传是后汉时候开始。
    从天文年历中，可以找到农历每年正月初一的日序，然后按序排列，就可以推算出三伏天的起始日期。比如今年农历正月初一的日序是“丙寅”，从而推算到农历五月初七（阳历6月22日）夏至那天的日序恰好是“庚午”，因此第三个庚日（每十天有一个庚日），就是农历五月二十六日（阳历7月12日），这一天的日序是“庚寅”，初伏便从这天开始了。再数到第四个庚日是“庚子”，那就是农历六月初六（阳历7月22日），便叫做“中伏”。继续数到农历六月二十三日（阳历8月8日），这一天是“立秋”节气，日序为“丁巳；因为丁日过后第三天便到庚日，于是农历六月二十六日（阳历8月11日），就是末伏了。
    “三伏天”是在我国盛夏时期，它的天气特点，在江南一带，梅雨天气已经消逝，海上吹来了晴热的东南风（夏季风），天气亢旱，有时还遭到台风的侵袭。至于华北一带，往往是在天气炎热之日，雷雨时行，造成了夏雨集中。总的说来，在这一段时间里，根据历史纪录，全国各地日平均温度和最高温度都是一年中的最高纪录。
