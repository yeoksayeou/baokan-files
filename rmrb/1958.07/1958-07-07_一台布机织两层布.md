Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th July: "How wonderful it would be if one loom could weave two layers of cloth at the same time!" This was an ideal that many textile workers once had. On the 4th, Le Xiude, a machine repair worker at the Shanghai Joint State-Private Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 2, and the maintenance worker group at the Guangda Dyeing and Weaving Factory, almost simultaneously turned this ideal into reality. They each initially successfully modified a loom that can weave two layers of cloth at the same time.

The modification methods of these two looms are very similar. Both involve improving the heddles of the original loom, adding a layer of reed seat and a layer of breast beam, and using two shuttle boxes, so that two layers of cloth can be woven at the same time. The modification method is not complicated, and the cost is not high, and it can be used on general looms.

Le Xiude is an ordinary mechanic who dares to think and dares to do. Recently, he was inspired by the news in the newspaper that printing and dyeing factories use a printing roller to print two pieces of printed cloth at the same time. Therefore, he proposed the idea of weaving two layers of cloth simultaneously with one loom, which was encouraged and supported by the leadership, and with the help of technicians, the initial experiment was successful.

### 一台布机织两层布

    一台布机织两层布
    新华社上海6日电“一台布机如果能够同时织出两层布来，该有多好！”这是不少纺织工人曾经有过的理想。上海公私合营恒丰染织二厂的修机工人乐秀德和光大染织厂的保全工人小组，4日几乎同时使这个理想变为现实。他们各自初步改装成功一台可以同时织两层布的织机。
    这两台织机的改装方法极相近似，都是把原来织布机的棕丝加以改进，各增加一层筘座和一层胸梁，同时采用两只梭箱，就可以同时织出两层布来。改装方法并不复杂，费用也不大，一般织机上都可以采用。
    乐秀德是个敢想敢干的普通机匠。最近，他从报纸上看到印染厂使用一只印花滚筒能同时印出两匹花布的消息，受到了启发。于是提出一台布机同时织两层布的主张，得到了领导上的鼓励和支持，并在技术人员的帮助下，初步试验成功。
