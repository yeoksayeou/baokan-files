Advance Holding High the Banner of Defending Peace and Friendly Unity!
– On the Achievements of the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation
Zhang Yun, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation

The Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation was held in Vienna from June 1st to 5th. This congress had broad representation. A total of more than three hundred and sixty delegates, observers, and guests participated. They came from more than seventy countries, including women from socialist countries, women from nationally independent countries, women from capitalist countries, and women from colonial and semi-colonial countries. They had different religious beliefs and political views. Some were members of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and others were non-members. The number of women from Asia, Africa, and Latin America attending this congress was greater than at any previous meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation. Among the more than three hundred and sixty women who participated in the congress, there were various professions and social identities. It is worth noting that eighty-seven housewives participated in this meeting, accounting for one-fourth of the total number of people. These facts not only illustrate the broad representation of this congress, but also demonstrate that in the five years since the Copenhagen World Women's Congress, more women around the world have awakened and united, and are actively working for world peace, human progress, and the happiness of women and children. This is an exciting thing.

This congress affirmed the role of women in the modern world, especially the enormous role that women play in the struggle to defend peace and national independence. This congress also reflected the strong desire and will of women around the world to defend life and peace, and discussed important issues in the lives of women and children. The congress heard a report by Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on "The Current Role and Responsibilities of Women and the Tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation," and a report by Mrs. Carmen Zanti, Secretary-General, on the draft of the new charter of the Women's International Democratic Federation. At the same time, three special committees were formed for discussion. These three topics were: first, "Defending Life"; second, "Creating Conditions for Women to Fully Play Their Role in Society as Mothers, Citizens, and Workers"; and third, "Protecting the Rights of Children and Educating Children and Youth in the Spirit of Peace and Friendship Among All Peoples." Through such discussions, the opinions and demands of women from various countries were expressed, enriching the agenda of the congress, and also enabling the women representatives of all the countries present to be inspired and encouraged, to enhance understanding and unity, and to further strengthen their courage, determination and confidence to fight for world peace, human progress, and the happiness of women and children.

This meeting prominently demonstrated the rising anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist sentiments of women in non-independent and not-fully-independent countries. The congress gave them warm support. Women from colonial and semi-colonial countries at the meeting accused colonial rule of placing them in a painful situation of poverty, hunger, plunder, insult, and massacre. A representative from French Sudan said: "We yearn to be freed from this chain of enslavement." They also spoke about the heroic struggles of women in their countries. The Algerian representative spoke of how many women demonstrated noble national integrity and selflessness in their national liberation war. Some fought to the last drop of blood on the battlefield; others were subjected to inhuman torture after being arrested, but remained steadfast. She called for an end to the criminal colonial war in Algeria through peaceful consultation. Representatives from many other countries in Asia and Latin America accused American monopoly capital of economic control and exploitation of their countries, demanding not only political independence, but also economic independence. Their speeches reflected the deeper desire of the people of many countries for national independence, reflecting a new trend in the struggle for national independence. The declaration and resolutions of the congress supported the demands made by the representatives of these countries. When we saw the representatives of Asian, African, and Latin American countries at the congress, one by one, standing on the podium of the Fourth Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation with high spirits, solemnly narrating their struggles and expressing their firm fighting spirit, it made people truly feel that colonialism is not far from its end.

At the congress, everyone also carefully listened to the speeches of representatives from many capitalist countries. The women in these countries are increasingly aware of their dangerous situation and their serious responsibility for defending peace. Together with the people of their own countries, they have held large-scale rallies and demonstrations to oppose the testing and use of atomic weapons, to oppose the establishment of atomic weapons bases and rocket launch pads on their national soil, and to oppose the flight of American planes carrying atomic bombs in the sky. A British representative said that in her country, large numbers of women who had never participated in the peace movement before are actively participating in the struggle against atomic weapons. An American representative said that American mothers are fighting against the shortages in schools, nurseries, and medical institutions caused by the unlimited expansion of military spending. The French women's representative emphasized the struggles of French women in recent years to defend peace and demand that the government end the colonial war in Algeria. The French people are currently waging a strong struggle against the resurgence of fascist forces and to defend the republican system and democratic freedoms, and French women are also playing an important role in this struggle. At this congress, everyone was pleased to see that the people's struggle to defend peace and strive for democracy in capitalist countries has made new progress, and the people's united strength is rapidly growing and becoming increasingly powerful.

The speeches of all the representatives of socialist countries reflected the prosperous national economy, the continuous improvement of the material and cultural lives of the people, the full realization of women's rights, and the full development of their talents, and the care and protection of children by the state. This made everyone who participated in the meeting more clearly realize that only socialist society can truly enable women and children to obtain a happy life. The Soviet and Chinese representatives both pointed out in their speeches that the strength of the socialist countries has played a major role in changing the balance of power between peace and war in the international community, and that the world situation has entered a new stage favorable to peace; moreover, due to the rapid advance of industrial and agricultural production in socialist countries and the serious economic crisis in capitalist countries, this change in the balance of power is continuing to develop. Everyone who participated in the meeting was greatly encouraged by the hope brought about by this new situation. When the Soviet representative spoke of all the possible measures taken by the Soviet government and people to defend peace and ease international tensions, and of the Soviet Union's tremendous scientific achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, as well as artificial satellites and aviation, which increased the favorable factors for world peace, the venue repeatedly resounded with warm applause.

The representatives present were also extremely interested in and welcomed the speeches of the Chinese representatives. When we talked about our people accelerating our socialist construction in order to achieve common prosperity and enhance the strength to defend world peace, when we talked about the situation of the Great Leap Forward of the whole people, and when we talked about the leaping atmosphere that has appeared in production and work after the liberation of women's thinking, the whole audience paid close attention and expressed congratulations with warm applause. When we talked about China surpassing Britain's production level in fifteen years or less, many people showed surprised and happy expressions. The speeches of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries made the participants see a new life and the great power of the people.

On the afternoon of the last day of the congress, the new charter of the Women's International Democratic Federation was discussed and passed, the new leading body was elected, and the congress declaration and the three resolutions written by the special committees based on the results of the discussions were discussed and passed. The meeting on this day continued until after one o'clock in the morning, and finally closed victoriously amidst cheers from the entire venue.

In the documents passed by the congress, the main tasks of women around the world were determined, and specific goals for the struggle for women's rights and children's happiness were put forward. The congress declaration and the resolution of the Committee for the Defense of Life both pointed out that the main responsibility of women at present is "Defending Life." Because mankind has entered the atomic age, atomic energy and other great scientific discoveries, if used to promote human happiness, will bring a bright future to people's lives; but atomic war will cause large-scale destruction. Both documents point out: The atomic war that the war groups are preparing is indeed a serious danger to mankind, and their repeated atomic weapons tests are already spreading chronic death. Both documents say that women are the bearers of life, and their primary task is to defend life. In order to assume the responsibility of defending life, women must currently unite closely to oppose atomic weapons tests, and then further demand the prohibition of the manufacture and destruction of existing atomic weapons. This will pave the way for disarmament and realize the desire of people all over the world to stop new wars and consolidate lasting peace. In the resolutions of the two committees on Women's Rights and the Protection of Children, a number of specific suggestions and appeals are put forward regarding the protection of motherhood, enabling women to receive due training, increasing educational institutions for children and young people, and cultivating good character in children and young people. Both documents also emphasize: "The most urgent issue currently above all else is to maintain peace." "Only in a peaceful world can women's rights be advanced" and can the lives of children and young people be free from threats. This congress achieved a clear and consistent understanding of the direction of the world women's movement. That is: based on the responsibility of defending life, and for the fundamental interests of women and children, women around the world must play a greater role in defending peace. This is one of the most important achievements of this congress.

For several years, the Women's International Democratic Federation has been advocating and striving to achieve friendly unity and friendly cooperation among women and women's organizations in various countries. This congress further embodied this spirit. As I said earlier, in addition to delegates, there were also observers and guests attending this congress, which shows that this congress was a congress of unity and cooperation. The new charter of the Women's International Democratic Federation passed by this congress also runs through the spirit of unity and cooperation. We know that the more extensive unity of women from various countries means the greater expansion of the forces for maintaining peace, and the greater isolation of the forces of war. Therefore, the congress declaration pointed out: "The unity of all women and women's organizations who demand liberation, defend children, and defend peace will be an invincible force." This congress established the spirit of unity and cooperation as the guiding principle for action in the world women's movement, which is another important achievement of the congress.

We Chinese women warmly support the declaration and resolutions of this congress. In addition to responding to the various calls of the Women's International Democratic Federation and supporting the struggles of women in various countries, Chinese women have always regarded accelerating our country's peaceful construction and promoting friendship with women in various countries as our practical efforts to defend peace. In the future, we will continue to work hard in these two aspects as our actions to respond to the call of this congress and fulfill the resolutions of the congress. On the one hand, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must emancipate our minds, establish a communist style, strive to improve our culture and technology, play a creative role in our respective positions, and make contributions to production and construction or to various undertakings and work that serve production and construction. Because we know that the sooner our country is built into a socialist country, and the sooner we catch up with or surpass capitalist countries in industrial and agricultural production, the stronger the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will be. The strength of this camp can stop wars and defend peace. The rights of women and the happiness of children in various countries can also be fundamentally guaranteed. On the other hand, we must not only strengthen the unity with women in socialist countries, but also work with them to make every effort to strengthen friendly unity with women in various countries. We believe that, on the basis of the existing socialist consciousness, and under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our sisters throughout the country will surely be able to make greater and greater contributions to the above-mentioned two aspects of work.

    高举保卫和平、友好团结的旗帜前进！
    ——关于国际民主妇联第四次代表大会的成就
    出席国际民主妇联第四次代表大会中国代表团团长　章蕴
    国际民主妇联第四次代表大会是6月1日到5日在维也纳举行的。这次的大会有着广泛的代表性。参加这次大会的一共有三百六十多位代表、观察员和来宾。她们来自七十多个国家，有社会主义国家的妇女，有民族独立国家的妇女，有资本主义国家的妇女，有殖民地、半殖民地国家的妇女。她们有着不同的宗教信仰和政治见解。有的是国际民主妇联的会员，有的是非会员。出席这次大会的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的妇女比国际民主妇联以前任何一次会议都多。在参加大会的三百六十多位妇女中间，有着各种职业和社会身份。值得注意的是参加这次会议的有八十七位家庭妇女，占全体人数的四分之一。这些事实不仅说明这次大会有着广泛的代表性，同时也说明了从哥本哈根世界妇女大会以后的五年来，全世界更为广大的妇女已经觉悟起来，团结起来，已经为世界和平、人类进步事业和妇女儿童的幸福积极地行动起来。这是令人兴奋的事情。
    这次大会肯定了妇女在现代世界中的作用，特别是妇女在保卫和平与民族独立斗争中所发挥的巨大作用。这次大会也反映了全世界妇女对保卫生命、保卫和平的强烈的愿望和意志，讨论了目前妇女和儿童生活中的重要问题。大会听取了国际民主妇联主席欧仁妮·戈登夫人关于“妇女当前的作用和责任与国际民主妇女联合会的任务”的报告，听取了总书记卡门·桑蒂夫人关于国际民主妇联新会章草案的报告，同时并组成三个专题委员会分别进行了讨论。这三个专题是：第一，“保卫生命”；第二，“创造条件，使妇女充分发挥在社会上作为母亲、公民和劳动者的作用”；第三，“保卫儿童的权利，以和平和各国人民友爱的精神教育儿童和青年”。经过这样的讨论，表达了各国妇女的意见和要求，丰富了大会的议题，同时也使所有到会国家的妇女代表相互得到了启发和鼓舞，增进了了解和团结，也更增强了为世界和平、人类进步事业和妇女儿童的幸福而斗争的勇气、决心和信心。
    这次会议突出地表现了未独立和未完全独立国家妇女高涨的反殖民主义和反帝国主义的情绪。大会对她们给予了热烈的支持。殖民地和半殖民地国家的妇女在会上控诉了殖民统治使他们处于贫困、饥饿，被掠夺、被侮辱、被残杀的痛苦情境。法属苏丹的代表说：“我们渴望着从这条奴役的铁链中解放出来。”她们也讲了她们国家妇女英勇斗争的情况。阿尔及利亚代表谈到在她们民族解放战争中，许多妇女表现了高贵的民族气节和忘我精神。她们有的在战场上战到流出最后一滴血；有的在被逮捕以后遭受到惨无人道的酷刑，还是坚贞不屈。她呼吁通过和平协商结束正在阿尔及利亚进行的罪恶的殖民战争。还有亚洲和拉丁美洲的许多国家的代表，在会上指责美国垄断资本对自己国家的经济控制和榨取，要求不仅在政治上独立，而且要在经济上获得独立。在她们的发言中反映出许多国家人民对民族独立的更为深刻的愿望，反映出民族独立斗争的新的趋向。大会的宣言和决议对这些国家的代表们提出的要求给予了支持。当我们在大会上看到亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的代表们，一个个都意志昂扬地在国际民主妇联第四次代表大会的讲台上，庄严地叙述她们的斗争情况和表示她们的坚决斗志时，使人真正感到殖民主义距离它的末日已经不远了。
    在大会上大家也都注意地听取了许多资本主义国家代表的发言。这些国家的妇女越来越认识到自己危险的处境和对保卫和平的严重责任。她们和本国人民一起，为反对试验和使用原子武器、反对在本国国土上设立原子武器基地和火箭发射台、反对美国运载原子弹的飞机在上空飞行，纷纷举行了大规模的集会和游行示威。英国代表说，在她们国家里大批从来没有参加过和平运动的妇女在反对原子武器斗争中，积极地行动起来了。一位美国代表说，美国的母亲们正在和由于军费无限制的扩大，使得学校、托儿所、医疗机关深感缺少的现象进行斗争。法国妇女代表着重地说到了近年来法国妇女为保卫和平和要求政府结束在阿尔及利亚所进行的殖民战争而进行的斗争。法国人民目前正在为反对法西斯势力的卷土重来、保卫共和制度和民主自由而展开坚强的斗争，法国妇女在这一斗争中也起着重要的作用。这次大会上，大家都高兴地看到，资本主义国家人民保卫和平和争取民主的斗争有了新的发展，人民的团结力量正在迅速增长和日益强大起来。
    所有社会主义国家代表的发言，都反映了这些国家国民经济的欣欣向荣，人民的物质和文化生活的不断提高，妇女的权利已经完全实现，才能得到充分的发挥，儿童受到国家的关怀和保护。这使所有参加会议的人更加明显地认识到，只有社会主义社会才能使妇女儿童真正获得幸福的生活。苏联和中国代表在发言中都指出，由于社会主义国家的强大，对国际间和平与战争两种力量对比的改变起了重大的作用，世界形势已经进入有利于和平的新的阶段；而且由于社会主义国家工农业生产正在飞跃前进和资本主义国家发生了严重的经济危机，这种力量对比的改变还在继续发展。所有参加会议的人都为这种新形势所带来的希望感到极大的振奋。当苏联代表谈到苏联政府和人民为保卫和平、缓和国际紧张局势所采取的一切可能的措施，谈到苏联和平利用原子能以及人造卫星、航空等方面的巨大科学成就，增加了世界和平的有利因素的时候，会场上不止一次的响起了热烈的掌声。
    对中国代表的发言，到会的代表也极感兴趣和欢迎。当我们谈到我国人民为达到共同富裕和增强保卫世界和平的力量，正在加速我国社会主义建设时，谈到全民大跃进的情况时，谈到妇女在思想解放以后在生产和工作上所出现的跃进气象时，全场都非常注意并以热烈的掌声表示祝贺。当我们谈到我国要在十五年或者更短的时间内超过英国的生产水平时，不少人显露出了又惊奇而又高兴的神情。苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家的发言，使参加大会的人看到了新的生活和人民伟大的力量。
    在大会最后一天的下午，讨论通过了国际民主妇联的新章程，选举了新的领导机构，讨论通过了大会宣言和专题委员会根据讨论结果写成的三个决议。这一天的会继续到深夜一点多钟，最后在全场欢呼声中胜利闭幕。
    在大会通过的文件里，确定了全世界妇女当前的主要任务，并提出了为争取妇女权利和儿童幸福的具体的奋斗目标。大会宣言和保卫生命委员会的决议中都指出，当前妇女主要的责任是“保卫生命”。因为人类已经进入了原子时代，原子和其他巨大的科学发现假使用来增进人类的幸福，将会给人们的生活带来光辉的前景；可是原子战争却将造成大规模的毁灭。这两个文件指出：战争集团正在准备的原子战争固然对人类是一种严重的危险，就是他们一再进行的原子武器试验也已经在散布着慢性的死亡。这两个文件中都说妇女是生命的孕育者，首先的任务是要保卫生命。妇女为担负起保卫生命的责任，在目前必须紧密地团结起来反对原子武器试验，从而再进一步要求禁止制造和销毁已经存在的原子武器。这样就能为裁军铺平道路，才能实现全世界人民制止新的战争、巩固持久和平的愿望。在妇女权利和保卫儿童两个委员会的决议中，都提出一些保护母性、使妇女得到应有的培养训练、增设儿童青年的教育机构，培养儿童和青年的优良品德等方面的一些具体建议和号召。这两个文件同时也都强调的指出：“目前驾于一切之上的最迫切的问题是维护和平。”“只有在一个和平的世界里，妇女的权利才能进展”，也才能使儿童和青年的生命免除威胁。这次大会对世界妇女运动的方向获得了明确和一致的认识。就是：全世界妇女本着保卫生命的责任，并且为了妇女儿童的根本利益，必须为保卫和平发挥更大的作用。这是这次大会一项最重要的成就。
    国际民主妇联几年以来，一直在提倡并且努力实现各国妇女和妇女组织之间的友好团结和和友好合作。这次大会进一步体现了这种精神。我在前面已经说过，参加这次大会的除了代表以外，还有观察员和来宾，说明这个大会就是一个团结和合作的大会。这次大会通过的国际民主妇联新章程，也贯穿了团结合作的精神。我们知道，各国妇女更加广泛的团结，就是维护和平力量的更加扩大，战争势力的更加孤立。所以大会宣言中指出：“一切要求解放、要求保卫儿童和保卫和平的妇女和妇女组织团结起来，就会是一支不可胜利的力量。”这次大会把团结与合作的精神确定为世界妇女运动中的行动方针，这是大会另一项重要的成就。
    我们中国妇女热烈拥护这次大会的宣言和决议。我国妇女几年来除了响应国际民主妇联的各项号召，支持各国妇女的斗争而外，一贯是以加速我国的和平建设、增进与各国妇女之间的友谊，作为我们为保卫和平而进行的实际努力。今后我们仍然要从这两个方面来继续努力，作为我们响应这次大会号召和履行大会决议的行动。一方面我们要在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，解放思想，树立共产主义的风格，努力提高文化与技术，在各自的岗位上发挥创造性的作用，对生产建设或者为生产建设服务的各种事业和工作作出贡献。因为我们知道，我国尽快地建成社会主义，在工农业生产上尽快地赶上或者超过资本主义国家，这就是加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。这个阵营的强大，就能制止战争保卫和平。各国妇女的权利和儿童的幸福也就能够得到根本的保障。另一方面，我们不但要加强和社会主义各国妇女之间的团结，并且要和她们一起，尽一切努力，加强和各国妇女之间的友好团结。我们相信全国姊妹在已有的社会主义觉悟的基础之上，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的正确领导之下，对上述两个方面的工作，一定能作出更多更大的贡献。
