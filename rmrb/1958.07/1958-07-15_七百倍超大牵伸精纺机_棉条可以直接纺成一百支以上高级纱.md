    700-Fold Super High Draft Spinning Frame
    Cotton Sliver Can Be Spun Directly Into High-Grade Yarn of 100 Counts or Higher
    Good news of technological innovation in Shanghai's textile industry continues to arrive. Following the successful trials of super high draft spinning frames that directly spin cotton slivers into fine yarn with drafts of one hundred and several dozen times by State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and No. 12, on the 13th, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 further successfully modified a 700-fold super high draft spinning frame, which can directly spin cotton slivers into high-grade cotton yarn of 100 counts or higher. The draft ratio of this spinning frame exceeds the famous Japanese OMS super high draft spinning frame, reaching the most advanced level in the world. All the equipment of this spinning frame was modified from domestically produced spinning frames, and the quality of the spun yarn reaches the top superior grade.
    This major innovation project was originally planned by State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 to be successfully tested by the end of this month, to be dedicated as a gift to the "August 1st" Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, encouraged by the great leap forward situation across the country, all the workers in the factory launched a large-scale collaboration and completed this experiment ahead of schedule. The workers are making persistent efforts and will further test a 1,000-fold super high draft spinning frame. (Xinhua News Agency)

    七百倍超大牵伸精纺机
    棉条可以直接纺成一百支以上高级纱
    上海纺织工业技术革新的捷报接连而来。继国棉一厂、十二厂等试验成功一百几十倍的用棉条直接纺细纱的超大牵伸精纺机以后，13日，国棉二厂又进一步改装成功一台七百倍超大牵伸精纺机，可以用棉条直接纺成一百支以上的高级棉纱。这台精纺机的牵伸倍数超过著名的日本OMS超大牵伸精纺机，达到了世界上最先进的水平。这台精纺机的全部设备都是在国产精纺机上加以改装的，纺出棉纱的质量达到上等优级。
    这一重大革新项目，国棉二厂原计划在本月底试验成功，用来向“八一”中国人民解放军建军节献礼。但在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，全厂职工展开大协作，提前完成了这项试验。职工们再接再厉，还要进一步试验一千倍的超大牵伸精纺机。　（新华社）
