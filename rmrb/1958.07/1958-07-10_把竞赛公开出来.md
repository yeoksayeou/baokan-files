Make the Competition Public
Yu Shu

In this high tide of the Great Leap Forward, many counties, townships, and communes are saturated with a competitive spirit: if you want a yield of two thousand catties per mu, I want mine to exceed two thousand catties; if you want to double grain production, I want mine to increase by at least one hundred percent. The content of the competition is very specific, but the form of the competition is not. We simply understand each other tacitly and work hard with our heads down.

Why? It is said that there are two reasons: Some people believe that the key to the Great Leap Forward lies in practical work and that we should not shout empty slogans. Some cadres in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan, have this view. Obviously, this is confusing revolutionary competition with formalism. Formalism should certainly be opposed because it is merely empty shouting, which not only does not help practical work but also affects it. However, if we have the content of competition and then give it the form of competition, if we have practical work and then add practical shouting, letting form promote content, letting practical shouting promote practical work, this is definitely not formalism, but precisely the Marxist understanding of the unity of content and form.

There are also some people who believe that it is okay to compete quietly, but public competition is not acceptable, because it would be shameful to lose. Some secretaries of the CPC Wenjiang County Committee in Sichuan have this view. Pi County wanted to strive for a yield of two thousand catties per mu and challenged various counties in the spring (when the targets were still lower). Wenjiang also strove for this goal, but still dared not publicly accept the challenge. In fact, the natural conditions of these two counties are equally good, both located on the beautiful Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan. There has always been the saying "Golden Wenjiang, Silver Pi County." Last year, Pi County's average yield per mu was one thousand catties, and Wenjiang was also close to one thousand catties. They are evenly matched and can compete fully. Those comrades who worry about losing actually do not understand that if the competition is limited to a "quiet" state, the chances of winning may not be great, but if the competition is made public, the chances of winning may actually be greater. The reason is very simple: this makes the goals of the competition clearer, the enthusiasm of the masses will be fuller, and the possibility of winning will be easier to turn into reality. In this case, the form of competition has a very positive meaning.

Of course, the situation of "what if" we lose cannot be said to be impossible. Even if it happens, it doesn't matter, as long as we are serious and earnest in the competition, working hard and practically, then we have achieved the purpose of the competition: promoting others, promoting ourselves, that is, promoting the cause of socialist construction, being open and aboveboard, and being witnessed by all. What shame is there to speak of?

Units with comparable conditions and willing to compete, take out the courage of communism and liberate the competition from the "quiet" state!

    把竞赛公开出来
    于蜀
    在这大跃进的高潮中，很多县与县、乡与乡、社与社之间都饱和着竞赛的心理：你要亩产双千斤，我的亩产还要超过双千斤；你要粮食产量翻一番，我的粮食产量至少也要增加百分之百。竞赛的内容很具体了，可是，竞赛的形式却没有。彼此只是心照不宣，埋头苦干。
    为什么？据说原因有二：有些人认为，大跃进嘛，关键在于实干，不应该虚喊。四川温江专区有些县、乡、社的干部就有这种看法。显然，这是把革命竞赛同形式主义混为一谈了。形式主义固然应该反对，因为它只是虚喊，不但无补于实干，还会影响实干。但是，有了竞赛的内容，再赋以竞赛的形式，有了实干，再加上实喊，让形式促进内容，让实喊推动实干，这决不是形式主义，正是马克思主义对内容和形式统一的理解。
    还有一些人认为，悄悄地竞赛一下还可以，公开竞赛可不行，万一赛不赢岂不丢人。中共四川温江县委有的书记就有这种看法。郫县要争取亩产双千斤，春天就曾向各县提出挑战（当时指标还低些），温江也向这个目标奋斗，但是至今都不敢公开应战。实际上这两个县的自然条件同样好，都在川西的锦绣平原上，一向就有“金温江、银郫县”之称，去年郫县平均亩产一千斤，温江也接近一千斤，旗鼓相当，完全可以竞赛。那些耽心赛不赢的同志其实不懂得，如果把竞赛限制在“悄悄地”状态中，赢的可能不大的话，把竞赛公开起来，赢的可能倒会大起来。道理很简单，这样竞赛的目标更明确，群众的干劲会更饱满，赛赢的可能就更容易变成现实。竞赛的形式在这种情况下就有很积极的意义。
    当然，“万一”赛不赢的情况不能说就不会发生。即使发生了，也不要紧，只要自己在竞赛中严肃认真，苦干实干，这就达到了竞赛的目的：促进别人，促进自己，也就是促进社会主义建设事业，光明磊落，人所共鉴，何丢脸之可言。
    一切条件相当而又愿意竞赛的单位，还是拿出共产主义的勇气，把竞赛从“悄悄地”状态中解放出来吧！
