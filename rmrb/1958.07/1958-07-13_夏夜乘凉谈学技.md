　　Talking About Learning Skills While Enjoying the Cool Evening Air
　　Yang Xuan

　　These past few days, when we gather to enjoy the cool evening air, the topic always revolves around the neighborhood residents running industries on a large scale. The speakers are enthusiastic, the listeners are animated, and often before one person finishes, another jumps in to start talking. I usually can't get a word in edgewise.

　　Tonight, I'll start. Looking up at the starry sky, I can't help but imagine the beautiful future of our society. Suddenly, someone pulled my arm. I turned to see Liang Jinmei. She pulled a small stool closer to me and sat down, saying, "I'm having trouble with something. My husband's factory is recruiting apprentices, and I meet the requirements. Should I go or not?" I said, "Of course, go! Why wouldn't you?" She said, "You don't understand, it's a tool repair shop. The work requires machines, and I have low education and no skills. Can I do it? I was thinking it might be better to go to the nursery, cafeteria, or sewing group, doing things I've done at home before, which I'd be more confident in." As she spoke, her eyebrows furrowed.

　　It's not surprising that Liang Jinmei has this kind of thinking. A housewife who has never touched machines before will naturally be a bit timid when suddenly asked to use them. Besides, in the past, people always made machines and technology sound very complicated and profound, which makes it even easier for women like Liang Jinmei to lose the courage to master them. This can also be considered a kind of inferiority complex and superstition! We must have the courage and drive to approach, learn, and study, breaking this inferiority complex and superstition. So, I encouraged her, saying, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets their mind to it. Machines and technology are created by people, there's nothing mysterious about them. If people can create them, they can use them. As long as you put in the effort, an iron rod can be ground into a needle. There's nothing in the world that can't be learned. The important thing is not to belittle yourself and not to be afraid of hardship. In fact, women are clever and skillful. Mastering general skills and managing general machines will definitely not be worse than men." I also told her: "A few days ago, the newspaper published a news item saying that housewives in Shijiazhuang have set up more than a thousand small factories. They originally had low education and no skills, but they dared to think and act, studying hard and practicing diligently, and quickly learned the technology. There's a 'March 8th' Women's Factory where the husbands of more than twenty female workers are workers in a water pump factory. They adopted the method of learning what their husbands do, establishing husband-and-wife apprenticeship contracts. In just over ten days, they learned the techniques of melting iron, casting, and making sand molds." I said, "Aren't you going to the factory where your husband works? Then you can do like they did, learning what your husband does. He helps you, wouldn't you learn faster? Then there's nothing to be afraid of!" Hearing this, her brow smoothed out, and she took my hand, saying, "Then I'll give it a try."

　　By this time, we were already surrounded by many people, and tonight's conversation had started with me.

    夏夜乘凉谈学技
    杨萱
    这几天夜晚乘凉，大伙凑到一块，话题总离不开街道居民大办工业的事儿。谈的人兴高采烈，听的人眉飞色舞，往往一个还没说完，别一个就抢上去说开了，我总是插不进口去。
    今晚我先来，对着满天繁星，摇着蒲扇，不由得想像起我们社会的幻丽的远景来。忽然有人拉了我一把，我回头看是梁金妹，她把小凳拉近我坐下说：“有件事犯难。我爱人厂里招收徒工，我的条件合格，去呢不去？”我说：“当然去，干吗不去？”她说：“你不知道呀，那是个工具修配厂，作活要用机器，我文化低，没技术，干得了吗？我想着不如去托儿所、食堂、缝纫组干些什么的，都是家常做过的活儿，倒还有把握。”她说着，两条眉毛都皱到一块儿去了。
    梁金妹有这种思想很难怪。一个家庭妇女从来没有接触过机器，忽然要去用它，自然会有些胆怯。何况过去人们总爱把机器和技术说得非常复杂艰深，就更容易使梁金妹这样的妇女失去掌握它的勇气。这也可以算是一种自卑和迷信吧！我们必须拿出勇气和干劲来，去接触，去学习，去钻研，打破这种自卑和迷信。于是我就鼓励她说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人。这机器和技术原都是人创造出来的，没有什么神秘。人既能造它，就能用它。只要功夫深，铁尺磨成针，天下那有学不会的事。重要的是不能自轻自贱，不要怕苦怕难。其实女同志心灵手巧，掌握一般技术，管理一般机器，是决不会比男同志差的。”我又告诉她：前几天报纸上登了一条消息说，石家庄的家庭妇女办起了一千多个小型工厂。她们原来也是文化低，没技术，但她们敢想敢作，苦学苦练，很快都学会了技术。有个“三八”妇女厂，有二十多个女工的丈夫是水泵厂的工人，她们就采取丈夫做什么、自己学什么的办法，和丈夫订立了夫妇师徒合同，只花十多天功夫，就学会了化铁、浇注、制砂模技术。我说：“你不是到你爱人工作的那个厂子去吗？那你更可以像人家那样，爱人作什么自己学什么，他帮助你，不是学的更快了吗？这才用不着怕呢！”这么一来，她的眉头舒展开来，握着我的手说：“那我就去试试看吧。”
    这时候，我们四周已经围坐了好些人，今夜大伙的谈话已经先从我开始了。
