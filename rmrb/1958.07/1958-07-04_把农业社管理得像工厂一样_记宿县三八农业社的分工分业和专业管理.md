    Managing Agricultural Cooperatives Like Factories
    —A Record of the Division of Labor, Specialization, and Professional Management at the Suxian "March 8th" Agricultural Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Fú Jūn

    I recently visited the Suxian "March 8th" Agricultural Cooperative in Anhui Province. The well-organized production order of this cooperative left a deep impression on me.

    The Huaibei Plain is currently in the busy season of summer harvesting and planting, with many agricultural tasks and limited time. Especially with the recent prolonged drought, farmers are battling day and night, making the situation even more urgent. When I arrived at the "March 8th" Cooperative, it was after the wheat harvest. Threshing, rice transplanting, well digging, and hoeing drought-resistant crops were all proceeding simultaneously in an extremely tense but orderly manner. In a rice farming area of over two thousand mu, I saw more than a thousand people working around the clock to transplant rice seedlings. They implemented a system of specialized division of labor, with dedicated personnel responsible for each process from plowing, diking, irrigating, and land preparation to transplanting. Each process was linked to the next, forming an assembly line, much like a large factory. Some of the cooperative's leaders were directing operations in this area. There was a bugler, and more than a thousand people started work, ended work, rested, and ate entirely according to the bugle calls. A leader of the cooperative told me, "The 'March 8th' Cooperative's relatively good production order is mainly due to the organization of specialized teams based on production needs, the division of labor and specialization, and professional management, all on the foundation of the great leap forward in thinking."
      
    New Contradictions Under the New Situation

    The "March 8th" Cooperative has 1,065 households, more than 4,800 people, and over 12,500 mu of cultivated land. Since the great leap forward in agricultural production began last winter, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members has soared to unprecedented heights. This year, the cooperative aims to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin. To accomplish this arduous task, the cooperative has made a series of reforms in the cropping system and farming methods. For example, this year, a large amount of high-yield crops will be planted. Having never grown rice before, the cooperative plans to convert 5,000 mu to rice cultivation, and the area for sweet potatoes will increase from 2,100 mu last year to 3,700 mu. Farming methods also require further intensive and meticulous cultivation, promoting deep plowing and close planting. For instance, in the past, corn was planted at about 1,400 plants per mu, but this year, the requirement is 2,200 plants per mu; sweet potatoes used to be planted at 1,700 to 1,800 plants per mu, but this year, the requirement is 3,400 plants per mu. The number of field management operations and the amount of fertilizer applied have also increased significantly compared to previous years. With the reform of the cropping system and farming methods, many new contradictions have arisen in production. First, to solve the problems of fertilizer, agricultural tools, and labor needed in the agricultural great leap forward, agricultural cooperatives must not only develop agriculture but also develop industries and processing industries that serve agriculture, integrating agriculture with industry and processing into a single entity. Second, the original simple division of labor can no longer meet the needs of the current comprehensive great leap forward in agriculture. Third, the original production techniques are no longer suitable for the leap forward development of agriculture. Fourth, the contradiction of labor shortage is particularly prominent. The "March 8th" Cooperative used a total of 45,000 workdays during the summer harvest and planting season last year, while this year, it is estimated that 87,000 workdays will be needed, an increase of about 100% compared to last year.

    Initially, the leading cadres of the "March 8th" Cooperative did not fully recognize these new contradictions under the new situation. Although the cooperative cadres were full of enthusiasm and energy, they lacked a clear understanding, resulting in passivity everywhere, with various tasks interfering with and affecting each other, preventing comprehensive development. Although the cooperative members' enthusiasm for work was also high, their jobs were not fixed, and they were constantly being transferred, making them feel that their strength could not be fully utilized. In agricultural production, various agricultural tasks lacked specific planning and specific standards, the quality was not high, and some rework occurred. Because these problems were not resolved in a timely manner, the entire cooperative's work was once in a state of confusion, and disputes frequently arose between cooperative and team cadres and members. Under these circumstances, cooperative cadres felt that various tasks could not be started, promoted, taken up, or put down. Some cooperative cadres said, "The situation has changed, and the original labor organization is no longer applicable!" Production team cadres also felt overwhelmed by many tasks, heavy responsibilities, and insufficient labor. The problems became increasingly apparent, and a great leap forward in labor organization and working methods was urgently needed.

    Division of Labor Under Unified Leadership

    How to solve the new contradictions under the new situation? After a period of research and exploration, the "March 8th" Cooperative decided to organize many specialized teams, with division of labor, specialization, and professional management. As work developed and needs arose, the cooperative first organized water conservancy teams, well digging teams, afforestation teams, and capital construction teams; then it established iron and woodworking agricultural tool repair and assembly plants, feed processing plants, flour mills, granular fertilizer plants, local fertilizer plants, sewing factories, and brick and tile kilns, which directly or indirectly served agricultural production. As the production season developed, it also organized rice transplanting teams, dry land teams, and machinery teams. The cooperative successively formed ten specialized teams and seven factories. Each specialized team has a unified organization throughout the cooperative, and specialized groups or teams are set up in each production team. All cooperative members and cadres participated in various specialized teams according to their strengths and work needs. Some of these specialized teams were permanently fixed, such as the seven factories and the relatively stable machinery team, afforestation team, and capital construction team. Others were relatively fixed, such as the rice transplanting team, dry land team, well digging team, and horticulture team. The work of these teams was basically fixed but changed with the seasons. For example, the rice transplanting team built water conservancy projects in the spring and winter, and planted rice in the summer and autumn; the dry land team accumulated fertilizer in the winter and planted dry land crops in the spring, summer, and autumn. These specialized teams had specific divisions of labor but were also under unified leadership, and in agricultural activities, they had to obey the overall needs and unified allocation of the agricultural cooperative. For example, during the summer harvest, the labor force participating in the summer harvest accounted for more than 90% of the cooperative's labor force. The division of labor in these specialized teams was very clear, and each team bore a specific task. For example, the sanitation and fertilizer collection team had 43 people, all elderly, who were scattered in various production teams throughout the cooperative. Their task was mainly to clean the environment, manage toilets, and collect manure and fertilizer. The afforestation team had 42 people, all elderly people with tree planting experience, whose task was to be responsible for planting trees and managing and maintaining tree seedlings. The rice transplanting team had 1,500 people, temporarily divided into water pumping, land preparation, and transplanting teams according to the nature of the work. They were mainly responsible for planting rice and studying rice production techniques.

    The Benefits of Specialized Teams

    Although the "March 8th" Cooperative has not organized various specialized teams, with division of labor, specialization, and professional management for a long time, its benefits have become quite apparent in several months of production practice.

    First, all full and semi-laborers in the cooperative were organized, further unleashing the production potential of all members, truly making the best use of everyone's talents. Originally, only 2,093 full and semi-laborers in the "March 8th" Cooperative participated in production, but after organizing specialized teams, this number has increased to 2,300. Most of the elderly, who rarely participated in labor in the past, now participate in the sanitation, fertilizer collection, and afforestation specialized teams, becoming more enthusiastic as they work. When the afforestation team recently evaluated models, half of the more than 40 elderly people in the team were rated as models. Some disabled people who could not engage in production in the past have become useful laborers after participating in specialized teams according to their physical strength. For example, Chen Mingxiu of the iron and woodworking agricultural tool repair and assembly plant has a problem with his left hand. He was originally a blacksmith and could not farm. In agricultural production, he was not even worth half a person, but after joining the iron and woodworking agricultural tool repair and assembly plant, he is now worth a full laborer. Chen Chengrui of the flour mill is a cripple who could not participate in agricultural production in the past, but after joining the flour mill, he is now worth a good worker.

    Second, the division of labor and specialization, with clear responsibilities, have improved work efficiency and ensured the quality of agricultural work. For example, in the past, each person could only excavate two or three cubic meters per day for water conservancy projects, but after organizing the water conservancy and capital construction team, work efficiency has increased to eight cubic meters. In the past, afforestation was not the responsibility of any particular person, and the trees planted were crooked and irregular, but since the establishment of the afforestation team, trees have been planted entirely according to specifications, and with dedicated management, the survival rate of the 15 million trees planted by the cooperative has reached over 90%.

    Third, a trend of in-depth study of production techniques has become widespread among cadres and the masses, and many production experts have emerged. For example, the members of the rice transplanting team have been studying diligently, and more than 500 people in the cooperative have learned rice planting techniques, and a large number of transplanting experts have emerged. In the granular fertilizer plant, shaking sieves to make granular fertilizer used to result in each person producing only 150 jin per day, with a maximum of 200 jin, and the granules were uneven in size. After studying and learning, the average daily output per person has now reached 1,000 jin, and two people have reached 1,400 jin, and the granules are uniform.

    Fourth, production order has been established, reversing the chaotic phenomenon in labor organization. Because the various specialized teams have a more rational division of labor and specialization, the use of labor is planned, and disputes over the allocation of labor have disappeared. Cooperative and team cadres have eliminated the phenomenon of being passive and busy, and can now concentrate on actively grasping production and the key issues in their work. The cooperative members' work has become fixed, and they have a clear understanding of their work, a direction for their efforts, and are no longer passively responding to assignments. Moreover, the division of labor and specialization have allowed them to use their expertise, so they are also very satisfied.

    Fifth, the planning of work has been strengthened. After the cooperative's agricultural production tasks were determined, the specialized teams all formulated production plans based on actual conditions and requirements for increased production. To ensure the completion of increased production tasks, the water conservancy team, the granular fertilizer plant, and the sanitation and fertilizer collection team have all made plans to increase fertilizer production and expand water conservancy construction accordingly. In this way, cooperation has been organized from all aspects, providing an important guarantee for completing the annual production tasks.

    New Leadership Methods and Problems

    With the establishment of specialized teams, the leadership methods of the "March 8th" Cooperative Management Committee have also been improved accordingly. Under unified leadership, cooperative cadres are responsible for specific tasks and lead various specialized teams separately. The Management Committee of the "March 8th" Cooperative and the Communist Party Branch have a total of 18 main cadres, and their division of labor is as follows: the director of the cooperative (concurrently the secretary of the Party branch) is responsible for leading the overall work; six people are responsible for rice transplanting, with two people responsible for each rice farming area; three people are responsible for the sowing and field management of dry land crops; two people are responsible for factory management, livestock raising, and sideline production; three people are responsible for the construction of water conservancy projects and biogas and hydroelectric power generation; one person is responsible for political work and literacy, eliminating the four pests, and other work; and one person is responsible for daily administrative management and material allocation. Each production team has also made appropriate divisions of labor among the team leaders according to actual conditions and work needs. In this way, under unified leadership, cooperative and team cadres have gone deep into various specialized teams, making it easier to participate in production, learn about production, and study techniques, overcoming generalized leadership methods and clericalism. The facts of the past few months show that since cooperative and team cadres have gone deep into the specialized teams, they have greatly changed their past superficial work style, mastered and improved production techniques, and strengthened their relationship with the masses.

    Organizing specialized teams, implementing division of labor, specialization, and professional management is a new attempt. Although it has already shown positive results, the organizational leadership experience is still incomplete. For example, there are still many specific problems in the cooperation and coordination between specialized teams, the internal management of each specialized team, and the labor remuneration and technical guidance of each specialized team. The leaders of the "March 8th" Cooperative are currently studying these problems in depth.

    把农业社管理得像工厂一样
    ——记宿县三八农业社的分工分业和专业管理
    本报记者　茀君
    记者最近访问了安徽宿县三八农业社。这个社生产秩序有条不紊，给记者留下了深刻的印象。
    淮北平原现在正是繁忙的夏收夏种季节，农活多，时间紧；特别是近来久旱不雨，农民正在与干旱日夜苦战，因此显得更加紧张。记者到三八社的时候，正是小麦登场以后，打场，栽秧，打井下泉，锄旱粮作物，很多工作都正在极其紧张中有条有理地同时进行着。在一块二千多亩的水稻作业区，记者看到一千多人正在这里日夜突击栽秧。他们实行了分工专职制，从耕地、打埂、灌水、整地到栽秧，每一道工序都有专人负责，一道工序扣住一道工序，形成了一条流水作业线，完全像一个庞大的工厂。在这块作业区，有社的一部分负责人在指挥作战。有个司号员，一千多人上工下工，休息吃饭，完全听号声按时作息。这个社的一位负责人告诉记者说：“三八社的生产秩序比较好，主要是由于在思想大跃进的基础上，根据生产需要，组织专业队，分工分业，专业管理的结果。”
      新形势下的新矛盾
    三八社共有一千零六十五户，四千八百多人，一万二千五百多亩耕地。自从去年冬天农业生产大跃进以来，社员的生产积极性空前高涨。今年这个社要求亩产量达到一千斤的指标。为了完成这个艰巨的任务，三八社在耕作制度和耕作方法上作了一系列的改革。如今年将大量种植高等作物。去年没有种过水稻，今年全社计划改种的水稻达五千亩，甘薯也将由去年的二千一百亩增加到三千七百亩。耕作方法也要求进一步进行精耕细作，推广深耕、密植。如往年玉米每亩种一千四百棵左右，今年每亩要求种二千二百棵；往年甘薯每亩一千七、八百棵，今年每亩要求达三千四百棵。田间管理的次数和施肥量也比往年大大增加。随着耕作制度、耕作方法的改革，在生产上发生了许多新的矛盾。第一，为了解决农业大飞跃中需要的肥料、农具、劳动力等问题，农业社既要发展农业，又要发展为农业服务的工业和加工业，使农业和工业、加工业结合成一个整体。第二，原来简单的劳动分工已经不能满足当前农业全面大跃进的需要。第三，原来的生产技术已经不能适应农业飞跃发展的需要。第四，劳动力不足的矛盾显得特别突出。三八社去年夏收夏种期间共用四万五千个工作日，而今年预计要用八万七千个工作日，比去年增加约一倍。
    开始，三八社的领导干部对于这种新形势之下的新矛盾是认识不足的。社干部虽然满腔热情，满身干劲，结果是心中无数，处处被动，各项工作互相牵扯，互相影响，不能全面发展。社员的劳动热情虽然也很高，但是工作不固定，不断抽来调去，也感到有力用不上。在农业生产上，各项农活缺乏具体规划和一定的规格，质量不高，发生了一些返工现象。由于这些问题没有及时解决，全社工作曾一度发生混乱现象，社队干部和社员之间经常闹意见。在这种情况下，社干部感到各种工作摆不开，推不动，拿不起，放不下，有些社干部说：“形势变了，原来的劳动组织不适用了！”生产队的干部也感到头绪多，任务重，劳力少，无法应付。问题日益明显，劳动组织和工作方法都迫切需要来一次大跃进。
    在统一领导下分工分业
    怎样解决新形势下的新矛盾呢？经过一个时期的研究和摸索，三八社决定组织许多专业队，分工分业，专业管理。随着工作的发展和需要，这个社首先组织了水利队、打井下泉队、绿化队、基本建设队；然后开办了直接或间接为农业生产服务的铁木业农具修配厂、饲料加工厂、面粉厂、颗粒肥料厂、土化肥厂、缝纫厂、砖瓦窑厂；随着生产季节的发展，又组织了改种水稻队、旱田队、机械队等，全社先后组成十个专业队，七个工厂。各个专业队在全社有统一的组织，在各生产队设有专业小组或小队。全社的社员和干部都按照各人的特长和工作需要参加了各种专业队。这些专业队有些是常年固定的，如七个工厂和变动不大的机械队、绿化队、基本建设队等。也有些是相对固定的，如改种水稻队、旱田队、打井队和园业队，这些队的工作基本上固定的，但又随着季节而变化。如改种水稻队春冬兴修水利，夏秋种水稻；旱田队冬季积肥，春夏秋种旱粮作物。这些专业队既有具体的分工，又有统一的领导，在农事活动上要服从农业社总的需要和统一调配。例如在夏收期间，参加夏收的劳动力占全社劳动力的90％以上。这些专业队分工非常明确，各个队都负担了专门的任务。例如卫生积肥队共有四十三人，全是老年人，分散在全社各个生产队，他们的任务主要是打扫环境卫生，管理厕所，拾粪积肥。绿化队共有四十二人，都是有植树经验的老年人，他们的任务是负责植树和树苗的管理养护工作。改种水稻队共一千五百人，按工作性质临时分为抽水、整地、栽秧三个队，他们主要是负责种水稻，钻研种水稻的生产技术。
    专业队的好处
    三八社组织各种专业队，分工分业，专业管理，虽然时间还不长，但是在几个月的生产实践中，已经十分明显地看到了它的好处。
    第一，把全社所有整半劳动力都组织起来了，进一步发挥了所有社员的生产潜力，真正做到了人尽其才。原来三八社参加生产的整半劳动力只有二千零九十三人，组织专业队以后已增加到二千三百人。过去很少参加劳动的老年人现在大部分参加了卫生积肥和绿化专业队，越干越起劲。绿化队最近评模，全队四十多个老年人有一半人被评上了模范。有些过去不能从事生产的残废人，按他们的体力参加专业队以后也变成了有用的劳动者。如铁木业农具修配厂的陈明秀左手有毛病，原来是个铁匠，不会种地，在农业生产中半个人也抵不上，参加铁木业农具修配厂以后，能抵一个整劳动力。面粉厂的陈成瑞，是个跛腿，过去不能参加农业生产，到面粉厂以后，也能抵上一个好人。
    第二，分工分业，责任明确，提高了工作效率，保证了农活质量。如兴修水利原来每人每天只有两三公方，组织水利基建队以后，工效提高到八公方。绿化过去无专人负责，栽的树歪歪斜斜，行不成行，距不成距，自从成立绿化队以后，完全按照规格栽树，又有专人管理，全社栽的一千五百万棵树成活率达90％以上。
    第三，从干部到群众，普遍形成了深入钻研生产技术的风气，涌现出许多生产能手。如改种水稻队的队员刻苦钻研，全社已有五百多人学会种水稻的技术，而且出现大批栽秧能手。颗粒肥料厂摇筛子制颗粒肥料，开始每人每天只能生产一百五十斤，最多生产二百斤，而且颗粒大小不匀，经过钻研学习，现在每人每天平均生产量已达到一千斤，有两个人已达到一千四百斤，而且颗粒均匀。
    第四，建立了生产秩序，扭转了劳动组织上的混乱现象。各专业队由于有了比较合理的分工分业，对劳动力的使用有了计划，争夺劳动力的纠纷已经没有了。社队干部已经消除了被动忙乱的现象，可以集中力量主动抓生产，抓工作中的关键问题。社员的工作固定下来，对自己的工作心中有数，有了努力方向，不再被动应差，而且分工分业又发挥了自己的专长，因此也很满意。
    第五，加强了工作的计划性。专业队在全社农业生产任务确定之后，都围绕增产的要求，根据实际情况制定了生产计划。为了保证增产任务完成，水利队、颗粒肥料厂、卫生积肥队等都相应地作了增产肥料、扩大水利建设的计划。这样，从各方面组织协作，对完成全年生产任务提供了重要的保证。
    新的领导方法和问题
    随着专业队的建立，三八社管委会的领导方法也相应作了改进。社干部在统一领导下分工负责，分别领导各个专业队。三八社的管委会和中共党支部共有十八个主要干部，他们的分工是：社主任（兼党支部书记）负责领导全面工作；六个人负责改种水稻，每两个人负责一片水稻作业区；三个人负责旱田作物的播种、田间管理；两个人负责工厂管理、牲畜饲养和副业生产；三个人负责水利工程和沼气发电、水力发电的施工建设；一个人负责政治工作和扫盲、除四害等工作；一个人负责日常行政管理和物资调配。每个生产队按照实际情况和工作需要，队长之间也作了适当分工。这样，在统一领导之下，社、队干部都深入到各个专业队，便于参加生产，学习生产，钻研技术，克服一般化的领导方法和事务主义。几个月来的事实说明，社队干部深入到专业队以后，已大大改变了过去不深入的作风，掌握并提高了生产技术，并且更加密切了和群众的关系。
    组织专业队，实行分工分业，专业管理，这是一个新的尝试，现在虽然已经显示出积极效果，但是组织领导经验还是不完整的。例如专业队之间的协作配合，各专业队内部的管理，各专业队的劳动报酬和技术指导还存在不少具体问题，现在三八社领导上正在深入研究这些问题。
