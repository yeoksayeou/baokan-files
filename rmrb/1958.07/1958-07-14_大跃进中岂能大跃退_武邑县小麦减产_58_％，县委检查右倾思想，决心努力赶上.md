How Can We Retreat in the Great Leap Forward?
    Wu Yi County Wheat Production Decreases by 58%, County Party Committee Examines Right-leaning Thought, Determined to Strive to Catch Up

    (Our Dispatch) The Party organizations and people of Wu Yi County, Hebei Province, have profoundly recognized the great significance of the General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" from the lessons of reduced wheat production. They are determined to catch up quickly and make up for the losses of the summer harvest with a bumper autumn harvest.

    Wu Yi County has the lowest yield of summer crops in Hebei Province this year. Based on the county's 210,000 mu of harvested wheat area, the average yield per mu is 25.81 jin, a 58% decrease compared to last year, only completing 21.5% of this year's planned output. If calculated based on a sown area of 300,000 mu, the yield per unit area is only 18 jin.

    Wu Yi County is located in the central plain of Hebei, bordering the Qingliang River to the east and the Fuyang River to the west. It has abundant underground water sources and a mild climate. Of the county's 1.2 million mu of cultivated land, black soil, white soil, and mixed soil account for more than 960,000 mu, about 80% of the total cultivated land. Alkaline and semi-alkaline land only accounts for more than 250,000 mu. The county has a population of 210,000, with an average of 4.6 mu of cultivated land per person. Although the soil quality is not bad, the masses' habit of extensive cultivation has not changed quickly, so production growth has been slow. However, this year the Bao Xianlan Cooperative in this county still achieved a high-yield record of 800 jin of wheat per mu. This proves that the wheat yield per unit area in Wu Yi County is not destined to be un-improvable.

    The Wu Yi County Party Committee recently convened a meeting of key township and cooperative cadres to seriously examine the reduction in wheat production. According to the results of the examination, the right-leaning and conservative thinking of the county committee leadership is the fundamental reason for the reduction in wheat production.

    Because the county committee leadership ideologically belittled wheat production, considering it a low-yield crop that "yields only what you put in," and that it was better to plant less than to plant more. Therefore, in the autumn wheat planting process, the county committee not only did not criticize the "three no-plantings" (no planting in drought, no planting without fertilizer, no planting when it's too late) erroneous thinking of some of the masses, but instead felt that this statement made sense. Of the county's 300,000 mu planting task, only 100,000 mu were planted by the Frost's Descent solar term, with two-thirds being sown after the Frost's Descent. Coupled with the drought and the use of water-carrying for planting and sparse planting, after the wheat emerged, it could not take root and the seedlings were small and weak. More than 100,000 mu were later damaged by frost because of the late planting. Not long after spring, 100,000 mu of wheat fields were destroyed. Although the county committee also put forward some measures and slogans for wheat field management, most of them were not implemented among the masses. For example, the county committee proposed topdressing wheat fields this spring, but many township and cooperative cadres told commune members to send the fertilizer to the uncultivated land. During the entire wheat field management process, very few people paid attention to the growth of the wheat. Due to lack of water and fertilizer, the wheat was inherently deficient and acquired inadequacies, so the yield was naturally very low.

    "The theory of conditions" restricted the leadership thinking of this county. The county committee leaders emphasized the characteristics of thin soil, poor people, much land (an average of 4.6 mu per person), little labor, susceptibility to drought, and the difficulty of changing extensive cultivation. More seriously, they superstitiously believed in the old saying handed down from the old society, "Golden Nangong, Silver Zaoqiang (two neighboring counties), Wu Yi is a large alkaline field," believing that the low yield was caused by objective conditions and could not be changed. Some cadres and the masses felt that it was not worth putting effort into the fields and that it was better to simply engage in sideline occupations. The county committee not only did not criticize this erroneous thinking of neglecting agriculture and emphasizing commerce, but instead expressed sympathy. Last year, when planting wheat, many fields were neither ploughed nor had base fertilizer applied, and were sown using ploughing and harrowing methods, with only eight jin of seeds sown per mu. Due to factors such as few seeds, hard soil, and late sowing time, most of the wheat seeds did not tiller, with one grain per ear. Until harvest time, looking along the ridges, the wheat was not even in rows. The county committee leaders had discovered the yellow and thin growth of wheat in their own experimental fields long ago, and had taken measures such as adding fertilizer, adding water, and more hoeing to turn the wheat from bad to good. However, they said that this could only be tested in small plots and could not be promoted on a large scale. The county's representatives also went to Anguo County, which is famous throughout the province for its high wheat yields, to visit, but the representatives in Anguo first asked not about the advanced experience and new technologies of wheat field management, but first asked how much land each person had on average, in order to prove that the wheat in their county was not good because there was more land and less labor. Some people also expressed their surrender after the visit, saying, "Anyway, it's no good, let's just take it slow!" This shows how serious their "theory of conditions" thinking was!

    The Wu Yi County Party Committee leadership was full of fear of difficulties and lacked drive. When carrying out the Party's tasks, they considered difficulties too much and underestimated favorable factors, lacking the courage and confidence to fight against difficulties. Last autumn, when the province launched a high tide of water conservancy construction, the Wu Yi County Party Committee emphasized difficulties such as "the weather is cold, materials are lacking, and we are afraid of casualties," and did not take active action. In a few months, the county only dug more than 700 soil wells and built 24 brick wells, which was far from meeting the needs of fighting drought, planting wheat, and spring irrigation. When the wheat turned green, the county committee put forward measures for watering the wheat, some people with serious conservative ideas issued the fallacy that "wheat has never been watered for greening since ancient times," and the county committee immediately withdrew the opinion on watering the wheat. The task of high-yield wheat fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu was assigned to the cooperatives at the time of sowing, but the county committee itself had no confidence in completing it. Therefore, they did not think of ways to find measures at all, let alone ask about the growth of high-yield wheat.

    The sharp contrast between the reduction in wheat production in this county and the universal bumper harvest of summer grain in the province and the country has made the leaders and people of Wu Yi County truly realize the truth that things are done by people. They are determined to immediately launch a high tide of vigorously publicizing and implementing the General Line throughout the county, organize a county-wide large-scale debate, and resolutely smash the theory of conditions that "harvests have good and bad years, and conditions are not the same." They will also take immediate measures such as drilling machine wells, vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and strengthening the management of autumn crops in order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

### 大跃进中岂能大跃退  武邑县小麦减产58％，县委检查右倾思想，决心努力赶上

    大跃进中岂能大跃退
    武邑县小麦减产58％，县委检查右倾思想，决心努力赶上
    本报讯　河北省武邑县的党组织和人民从小麦减产的教训中深刻地认识了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的伟大意义，决心急起直追，以秋季丰收弥补夏季减产的损失。
    武邑县是今年河北省夏收作物产量最低的一个县。按全县小麦收获面积二十一万亩计算，平均亩产二十五点八一斤，比去年减产58％，只完成今年计划产量的21.5％；如果按播种面积三十万亩计算，单位面积产量只有十八斤。
    武邑县位于河北中部平原，东临清凉江，西靠滏阳河，地下水源丰富，气候温和，全县一百二十多万亩耕地中，黑土、白土和二合土质的土地即有九十六万多亩，占耕地总数的80％左右，碱地和半碱地只有二十五万多亩，全县二十一万人口，每人平均耕地四点六亩。虽然土质不坏，但由于旱地较多，群众的粗放耕作的习惯没有迅速改变，因此，产量增长不快。但是就在这个县的鲍贤兰社今年仍然出现了亩产八百斤小麦的丰产纪录。这证明武邑县的小麦单位面积产量并不是注定不能提高的。
    中共武邑县委最近召开乡社主要干部会议，对小麦减产认真地进行了检查。根据检查结果，县委领导上的右倾保守思想，是造成小麦减产的根本原因。
    由于县委领导思想上轻视小麦生产，认为它是种“一葫芦打一瓢”的低产作物，多种不如少种。因此在秋季种麦过程中，县委不但没有批判部分群众的“三不种”（天旱不种，没肥不种，时间晚了不种）的错误思想，反而认为这种说法有道理。全县三十万亩的播种任务，到霜降节才种了十万亩，有三分之二是霜降以后下种的。加上天旱，采用担水浇种和稀植等原因，小麦出土以后，扎不下根去，苗小稀弱。有十多万亩因播种太晚后来受了冻害。入春不久，就毁掉了十万亩麦田。在麦田管理上，虽然县委也提出过一些措施和口号，但多数没有贯彻到群众中去。例如今年春天县委曾提出给麦田追肥，然而许多乡社干部却叫社员把肥料送到白地里。在整个麦田管理过程中，小麦的生长情况很少有人理睬。由于缺水少肥，小麦先天不足，后天失调，产量自然很低。
    “唯条件论”束缚着这个县的领导思想。县委领导人员强调地薄人穷、地多（每人平均四点六亩）劳力少，易遭旱灾，耕作粗放的特点难以改变。更严重的是迷信旧时代遗留下来的“金南宫、银枣强（两个邻县），武邑一片大碱场”的说法，认为产量低是客观条件造成的，不能改变的。有些干部和群众觉得在地里花工夫不够本，不如干脆搞副业。县委不仅没有批判这种轻农重商的错误思想，反而表示同情。去年种麦时，有很多地既没翻耕，更没施底肥，用犁耩犁的办法播了种，每亩下种只八斤。由于籽种少地皮硬，播种时间晚等等人为的因素，大部麦种没分蘖，一个种粒一个穗。直到收割时，顺垅看去，麦子还不成行。小麦长得又黄又瘦的情况，县委领导同志早在自己的试验田里就发现了，并且采取了加肥、加水、多锄等措施，使小麦由坏变好。但是，他们说这只能在小片地里试验，不能大面积推广。这个县的代表也曾到全省以小麦丰产出名的安国县去参观，但代表们在安国首先不是问麦田管理的先进经验和新技术，而是先问人家每人平均多少地，用以证明本县小麦不好是地多劳力少而造成的。也有些人在参观后表示甘拜下风，说：“反正是不行了，干脆慢慢来吧！”这说明他们的“唯条件论”的思想严重到何种地步！
    武邑县委领导思想上充满着畏难情绪，干劲不足，在执行党的任务时对困难考虑过多，对有利因素估计不足，缺乏向困难斗争的勇气和信心。去年秋后，当全省掀起水利建设高潮的时候，武邑县委却强调“天气冷了，物料缺乏，怕出伤亡事故”等困难，没有积极行动起来。在几个月内，全县只挖土井七百多眼，打砖井二十四眼，远远不能满足抗旱种麦和春浇的需要。当小麦返青的时候，县委提出了浇麦措施，一些有严重保守思想的人发出了“自古小麦不浇返青水”的谬论，县委马上撤回了浇麦的意见。亩产千斤的丰产麦田的任务，播种时就分配到合作社了，但县委本身就没信心完成。所以，根本没有想办法找措施，更没有过问过丰产麦的生长情况。
    本县小麦减产和全省全国夏粮普遍丰收的鲜明对照使武邑县的领导和人民，真正认识了事在人为的真理。他们决心立即在全县掀起一个大张旗鼓的宣传贯彻总路线的高潮，组织全县性的大辩论，坚决粉碎“收成有丰歉，条件不一般”的唯条件论。并采取立即打机井和大搞积肥，以及加强大秋作物管理等方法，力争秋季大丰收。（文英）
