Leaders and Ordinary Laborers
Ge De

The newspaper published news about Premier Zhou Enlai and other party and state leaders participating in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. Premier Zhou Enlai said to these leading comrades: "In common labor, there is no distinction between Premier, Minister, or Director-General; here, everyone is an ordinary laborer."

"Everyone is an ordinary laborer," what simple yet noble words.

Some people have different views. I remember last year, when the State Council issued an instruction on vigorously developing pig farming, there was a type of person who sneered and said: Raising pigs is originally a trivial matter, yet the dignified State Council actually discusses this matter and issues it as an imperial order; it has never been seen in history, and it is extremely ridiculous. In their view, for the dignified Premier of the State Council to associate his name with "raising pigs" is naturally a loss of "official dignity." Now, the "dignified Premier of the State Council" is not only associating his name, but also his whole body, with dirt carts, as we see in the photos. In the eyes of those who consider themselves "noble," I wonder how demeaning this must be.

However, we happily say, "Everyone is an ordinary laborer." Moreover, we are proud to be such laborers.

What that type of person calls "official dignity" can be translated into our language as "the identity of a leader." For a leader to discard his special identity and assume the attitude of an ordinary laborer is, in our opinion, a glory, something commendable but also taken for granted.

Now, among our leaders at all levels, there probably aren't any who think of themselves as officials, but there are still those who cherish the feathers of "leader" very much, constantly remembering their "identity," and liking to swagger in front of ordinary people to show their difference. We call this "official air," denounce it as a low-level taste, and consider it to be opposed.

What is a leader? What kind of relationship should a leader have with ordinary laborers? Some people distinguish leaders by the size of their power and position. In their view, the essence of the relationship between leaders and the masses is: I manage you, and you are managed by me. Therefore, the more people one manages, the bigger the leader, and thus one should be farther away from the masses and become more arrogant. The closer one is to the masses, the smaller the leader. Running down from above to get close to the masses is lowering one's status. If one is like an ordinary laborer, then the leader's feathers are equal to being plucked clean, and there is no leader's temperament at all; therefore, one cannot be a leader.

We communists have a different view. A leader is marked by whether he can concentrate and represent the will of the masses and lead the masses forward. The relationship between leaders and the masses, in addition to the aspect of leadership and being led, also includes I serve you, and you are my teachers. Therefore, the closer one is to the masses, the higher the quality of the leader, and the more one can live up to his name. A leader who can place himself among the masses like an ordinary laborer is a complete leader. In our country, there are many such leaders from top to bottom, and they are gradually increasing.

A true leader must have a noble communist style and be able to become a representative of truth. This cannot be judged by the height of position, let alone distinguished by "official air." What people follow forward is the truth pointed out by the leader, not the leader himself. Leaders naturally have their own positions and cannot use general manual labor to replace the heavy responsibilities they bear, but from the perspective of his identity, he is indeed equal to an ordinary laborer, and everyone should treat each other on an equal footing.

When we cheer long live the laborers, we must cheer even more: long live the tens of thousands of famous and nameless leaders in our country, from top to bottom!

### 领袖和普通劳动者

    领袖和普通劳动者
    葛德
    报上登了周恩来总理同党和国家领导干部在十三陵水库工地上参加义务劳动的消息。周恩来总理对这些领导同志说：“在共同劳动中没有总理、部长、司局长等职务之分，在这里大家都是普通的劳动者。”
    “大家都是普通的劳动者”，这是多么纯朴而又崇高的语言。
    有的人看法不同。记得，去年国务院发出一个关于大力发展养猪事业的指示的时候，曾有一种人，嗤着鼻子笑着说：养猪本来是一件婆婆妈妈的事，堂堂的国务院竟要讨论这种事，还要以皇皇的命令下达，历史上都没有见过，可笑之极。在他们看来，堂堂的国务院总理，竟把自己的名字同“养猪”联系起来，自然也是失了“官体”的。如今，“堂堂的国务院总理”，不只是把自己的名字，而且是把自己的全身，都同土车联系起来了，如我们在照片上看到的。在那些自以为“高贵”的人看来，不知这该是如何的等而下之的了。
    但是，我们却愉快地说“大家都是普通的劳动者”。而且，还以能作这样的劳动者为光荣。
    那种人所说的“官体”，翻成我们的话，大概就是“领导者的身份”。领导者丢掉自己的特殊身份，以一个普通劳动者的态度自居，在我们认为是一种光荣，是难能可贵但又是理所当然的。
    现在在我们的各级领导者中，自以为是官的人，大概不会有的，但也还有非常爱惜“领导者”的羽毛的人，念念不忘自己的“身份”，喜欢在普通人前摇来摆去，以显示自己与众不同，我们叫这作“官气”，斥之为低级趣味，属于反对之列的。
    什么是领袖？领袖同普通劳动者应是怎样一种关系？有的人是以权力、地位的大小来区分领袖的，在他们看来，领袖同群众的关系的实质，就是我管你们，你们被我管。因此，管的人越多，这领袖就越大，因而就应当离的群众越远，就要越神气。离群众越近，这领袖就越小，从上边跑下去接近群众，就是降低了身份，要是像一个普通的劳动者一样呢？领袖的羽毛就等于被拔光了，一点领袖的气质也就没有了；因而，也就不成其为领袖了。
    我们共产主义者的看法不同。领袖是以能不能集中和代表群众意志，率领群众前进为标志的。领袖同群众的关系，除了领导与被领导的一面以外，还有我为你们服务，你们是我的老师。因此，越能接近群众，这领袖的质量就越高，就越能名副其实。领袖能像一个普通劳动者一样处身于群众之中，这是一个完全的领袖。在我们国家里从上到下这样的领袖是很多的，而且日渐的更加多起来。
    真正的领袖，必须具有高尚的共产主义风格，能够成为真理的代表，这是不能以职位论高低，更不能以“官气”分上下的。人们所跟随着前进的，是领袖所指引的真理，而不是领袖本人。领袖们自然各有自己的岗位，不能用一般的体力劳动来代替自己所负有的重任，但是从他的身份讲，的确也不过同一个普通的劳动者相等，大家都应该以平等地位相处的。
    我们欢呼劳动者万岁的时候，我们更要欢呼：我们国家里，从上到下的数以万计的有名的和无名的领袖们万岁！
