    Exploring the Secrets of Restricted Areas of the Human Body
    Opening the Heart to Repair Heart Defects
    The Thoracic Surgery Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an has successfully performed the first open-heart surgery in China, using extracorporeal circulation (artificial heart-lung machine) to open the heart and repair a congenital ventricular septal defect in a patient. Open-heart surgery with direct vision under extracorporeal circulation is a first in China and has only begun in foreign countries in the last four or five years. The patient who underwent this surgery was a six-year-old boy named Liu Jinsheng. The surgery was performed by Associate Professor Su Hongxi of the hospital's Thoracic Surgery Department, with the close cooperation of first assistant Lecturer Lin Chongjia, anesthesiologist Shi Yuwu, Director of Internal Medicine Mu Shanchu, Acting Director of Pediatrics Li Qing, and related physicians and nurses from various departments, totaling seventeen people. At 9:00 AM on June 26th, he opened Liu Jinsheng's left and right chest cavities. At 10:53 AM, the extracorporeal circulation began to work, replacing the heart and lung function of the young patient, and the heart temporarily stopped blood circulation. Associate Professor Su Hongxi and others spent only twenty minutes repairing the heart defect. By 11:27 AM, the extracorporeal circulation had stopped working. Liu Jinsheng woke up, was conscious, and looked natural. After electrocardiogram and cardiopulmonary imaging and other examinations, the child's heart was functioning normally, blood pressure was stable, and breathing and pulse were good. The day after the surgery, he wanted to eat milk and popsicles, and also drank half a cup of chicken soup. Now, Liu Jinsheng has completely passed the critical period after the operation, and his physical and dietary condition is very good. (Attached photo)

    探索人体禁区的秘密
    打开心房修补心脏
    西安军医大学附属一院胸外科第一次成功地运用体外循环（即人工心肺）为一个先天性心室间隔缺损患者打开心脏，进行了修补手术。在体外循环下进行直视开心手术，在我国是第一次，在国外也只是最近四、五年才开始的事。接受这次手术的是一个年满六岁的男孩刘金生，施行这项手术的是这个医院的胸腔外科副教授苏鸿熙，他在第一助手蔺崇甲讲师和麻醉医师史誉吾，内科主任牟善初，儿科代理主任郦清以及有关各科医师、护士等十七人的密切协作下，进行了这次手术。6月26日上午九时他打开刘金生的左右胸腔。十时五十三分体外循环开始工作，代替了这位小病人的心肺功能，心脏也暂时停止了血液循环。苏鸿熙副教授等仅花了二十分钟时间，把心脏缺损修补完毕。到十一时二十七分体外循环停止工作。刘金生醒来，神志清醒，面容自然。经过心电图、心肺照像等检查，这个小孩的心路正常，血压平稳，呼吸脉搏很好。手术后第二天，他就要吃牛奶和冰棍，还喝了半杯鸡汤。现在，刘金生早已完全脱离手术危险期，身体和饮食情况都很良好。（附图片）
