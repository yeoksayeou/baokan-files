    Luzhou Chemical Plant Full of Vigor
    Striving for Advanced Standards in Various Products
    Many products recently produced by the Luzhou Chemical Plant have surpassed similar products from countries like England and the United States in quality, reaching international standards.
    Before "July 1st," Xiong Yongnian, a technician in the celluloid workshop, created eight types of fancy materials, bringing all quality standards of four types of celluloid sheets—fish scale, cyan-red, white bright, and ruler white—up to the level of Japan. Workers in the nitrocellulose workshop also improved the quality of nitrocellulose in late June, surpassing the overall level of France. The acid production workshop and laboratory, breaking away from blind faith in Western data, brought the quality and yield of DDT up to the level of England and the United States, with the yield jumping to over 290 kilograms, some even reaching over 300 kilograms, exceeding the English and American level of 280 kilograms. Workers manufacturing synthetic camphor reduced the distillation process, increasing the camphor yield to about 75%, shortening the production cycle by one-third, greatly exceeding that of England and West Germany.

    泸州化工厂干劲足
    多种产品力争先进
    泸州化工厂最近出厂的许多产品，质量已超过英美等国同类产品，达到国际水平。
    赛璐珞车间技术员熊永年在“七一”前夕，制出八种花料，将鱼鳞、青红、白明、尺白等四种赛璐珞片的全部质量标准赶上日本。硝化棉车间的职工也在6月下旬使硝化棉的质量全面超过法国水平。制酸车间和试验室，破除了对西方资料的迷信，使DDT质量和获得率赶上英美，获得率跃进到二百九十多公斤，有的甚至达到三百多公斤，超过英美二百八十多公斤的水平。制造合成樟脑的工人，减少了蒸馏工序，使樟脑获得率上升到75％左右，缩短生产周期三分之一，大大超过了英国和西德。
