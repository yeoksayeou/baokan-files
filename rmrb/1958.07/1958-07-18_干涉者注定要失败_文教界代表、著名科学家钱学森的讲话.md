    Interveners are Doomed to Fail
    Speech by Qian Xuesen, Representative of Literary and Educational Circles and Renowned Scientist
    The Iraqi patriotic soldiers, led by General Kassem, have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Faisal dynasty and established a republic of national independence, opposing imperialism and colonialism, on an area of ​​more than 436,000 square kilometers. The American and British imperialist dog, Said, has also been brought to justice. This is the victory of the more than six and a half million people of Iraq! This is another country that has long suffered from intense imperialist aggression and plunder that has been liberated! Asia has another country that has broken free from colonial shackles, another country that adheres to the principles of the Bandung Conference, and the forces against aggression and for peace are stronger. The Arab people's struggle for independence, the national liberation struggle throughout Asia and Africa, the liberation struggle of oppressed nations around the world, and the struggle of people around the world for peace and against new wars have all gained new strength. This is another surge in the power of the people, yes! Let American and British imperialism tremble; their throne in Iraq has become a volcano.
    We Chinese people are particularly excited and encouraged by the great victory of the Iraqi people, because we, like the Iraqi people, have long been subjected to imperialist oppression and plunder, and have lived a miserable life worse than dogs and horses. Therefore, we feel extra sympathy for the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people! Iraqi brothers! Your struggle is our struggle, your victory is our victory! This is the feeling of the Chinese people, and also the feeling of the Chinese scientific and technological workers. Iraqi brothers, we support you, and defending your victory is defending our victory!
    In such a situation of great popular victory, American imperialism is frantic. This jackal has finally taken off its mask. More than 5,000 troops of the American aggressors have already landed in Lebanon, attempting to prevent the Lebanese people from winning national independence and threatening to carry out armed intervention against the Iraqi people! But we want to strike a blow to the head of the American imperialists. Today, imperialism can no longer run rampant. Today, the forces against imperialism, against colonialism, and for peace in the world are no longer in the minority, but in the overwhelming majority. Even the peace-loving people in the United States itself are on our side. Interfering with national independence is doomed to failure today. Isn't the precedent of the British and French imperialists in Egypt a lesson from the past? American imperialists! What else can you scare people with today?
    We resolutely stand with the people of Iraq and Lebanon, and overthrow imperialism! We cheer for the victory of the Iraqi people! Long live the victory of the national independence movement in the Middle East!

    干涉者注定要失败
    文教界代表、著名科学家钱学森的讲话
    以卡塞姆将军为首的伊拉克爱国军人，已经推翻了费萨尔王朝的反动统治，在四十三万六千多平方公里的面积上建立了反帝国主义、反殖民主义的民族独立的共和国。美英帝国主义的走狗赛义德也已经伏法。这是六百五十多万伊拉克人民的胜利！这是又一个长期受着帝国主义强烈的侵略和掠夺的国家得到解放！亚洲又多了一个挣脱殖民枷锁的国家，又多了一个奉行万隆会议原则的国家，反对侵略、爱好和平的力量更加强大了。阿拉伯人民的独立斗争，整个亚非两洲的民族解放斗争，全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争和全世界人民争取和平，反对新战争的斗争，都因此得到新的力量。这是人民的力量再一次高涨，对！让美英帝国主义发抖；他们在伊拉克的宝座变成了火山。
    我们中国人民对伊拉克人民的伟大胜利感到特别欢欣鼓舞，因为我们也和伊拉克人民一样曾经长期受到帝国主义的压迫和掠夺，过过犬马不如的惨痛生活，我们因此对伊拉克人民的英勇斗争感到格外的同情！伊拉克的兄弟们！你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利！这是我们中国人民的心情，也是我们中国科学技术工作者的心情。伊拉克的兄弟们，我们支援你们，保卫你们的胜利就是保卫我们的胜利！
    就是在这样一个人民大胜利的情势下，美帝国主义急得发狂了。这样豺狼终于拉下了他们的假面具，美国侵略者的五千多军队已经在黎巴嫩登陆，企图阻止黎巴嫩人民争取民族独立的胜利，并且威胁着要对伊拉克人民进行武装干涉！但是我们要对着美帝国主义者的头打一棒，今天帝国主义已经再也不能横行霸道了，今天在世界上反帝国主义反殖民主义，爱好和平的力量已经不是占少数，而是占压倒的多数，就是美帝自己国家里爱好和平的人民也是站在我们这边的。干涉民族独立在今天是注定要失败的。英、法帝国主义者在埃及的复辙难道还不是前车之鉴吗？美帝国主义者们！你们在今天还有什么能吓唬人的呢？
    我们坚决地和伊拉克、黎巴嫩人民站在一起，打倒帝国主义！我们为伊拉克人民的胜利欢呼！中东各国的民族独立运动胜利万岁！
