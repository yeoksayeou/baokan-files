    Thermal Power Plants Break Convention, Reduce Coal Consumption in Summer

    The coal consumption of thermal power plants has historically been higher in May than in April, with last May being sixteen grams higher than April. This seemed to have become a natural law. However, this year, under the radiant light of the General Line, the workers of the electric power industry have been going all out, aiming high, causing May's coal consumption to be only one gram higher than April's. The fifteen bureaus combined averaged 510 grams, breaking the rule that coal consumption inevitably rises with hot weather.

    The main reason for the reduced coal consumption is the improvement of boiler efficiency. Many plants have cleaned their economizers and air preheaters; strengthened leak plugging, increased feed water temperature, strengthened plugging leaks, maintained stable combustion, cleaned cooling towers, and adjusted water distribution disks, among other measures. If thermal power plants across the country strengthen the management of boilers and cooling systems and promote the new technologies of each plant, it is entirely possible to reduce coal consumption.

    火电厂打破陈规降低夏季煤耗
    火电厂的煤耗历来是5月份比4月份高，去年5月份比4月份高十六克，这好像已成为一个自然规律。但是今年电力工业的职工在总路线的光芒照耀下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，使5月份的煤耗只比4月份多一克。十五个局合计为五百一十克，打破了天气热煤耗必然上涨的规律。
    煤耗降低的主要原因是，提高锅炉效率，很多厂都把省煤器和空气预热器加以清扫；加强了堵漏风，提高给水温度，加强堵漏，保持燃烧稳定，清扫冷却塔和调整淋水碟等等工作。如果全国的火电厂加强锅炉和冷却系统的管理，推行各厂的新技术，完全有可能降低煤耗。
