    China's First Current Meter Recorder
    Researchers and technicians at the Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, following the successful manufacture of China's first (BM-M) model current meter, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, worked diligently for seven days and successfully manufactured China's first current meter recorder on the 15th. This instrument is one of the world's advanced current measurement instruments, and is currently only available on the Soviet oceanographic survey ship "Vityaz," so it is also known as the "Vityaz" type current meter recorder. The original plan was to manufacture this instrument by October 1st, but it has now been completed two and a half months ahead of schedule. The manufacture of this instrument originally required many castings and special materials, but thanks to the ingenuity and diligence of the technical workers in the metal workshop, all of them were made from processed waste materials. This instrument is divided into three parts: current speed, current direction, and automatic recording. Because the instrument itself can continuously and automatically record, it does not require two people to operate and retrieve it from the sea for observation every eight to ten minutes as in the past, thus greatly saving manpower and increasing work efficiency by more than ten times.

    我国第一架海流记录仪
    中国科学院海洋生物研究所研究人员和技工，继制造成功我国第一台（BM—M）型海流计后，在苏联专家的指导下，苦战七天，于15日制造成功我国第一架海流记录仪。这种仪器是世界上先进测流仪器中的一种，在目前还只有苏联海洋调查船“勇士号”有，所以又称为“勇士号”型海流记录仪，这项仪器原计划在10月1日前制造成功，现在已提前二个半月完成。制造这种仪器本来需要许多铸件及特殊材料，由于金工厂的技术工人开动脑筋，充分发挥钻劲，全部利用废物加工制成。这架仪器共分为流速、流向、自动记录等三个部分，由于仪器本身能连续自动记录，就不像过去测流时需两个人操作和每八分到十分钟要从海中提出观测一次，因此大大的节省了人力，使工作效率提高十倍以上。　（新华社）
