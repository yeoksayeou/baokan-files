Grasp Staple Grains and Coarse Grains, Major Crops and Minor Crops Leap Forward Together
Sichuan Strives for Comprehensive Agricultural Production Increase

(Reported by our newspaper) Sichuan Province, in its great leap forward in agricultural production, is paying attention to implementing the policy of comprehensive production increase, striving to achieve increases in everything and an all-round bumper harvest.

In the great leap forward in agricultural production, various parts of Sichuan generally focused on the production of major crops such as grain and cotton, but relaxed leadership over the production of other coarse grains and cash crops, or only paid attention to major grain crops and large-scale crops, while neglecting coarse grain crops and sporadic crops. For example, corn is an important grain crop, but some places only emphasized planting sweet potatoes, squeezing out corn, resulting in a decrease of more than one million mu in corn planting area compared to last year. The Neijiang area is a major sugarcane producing area. Although the local area focused on increasing the production of rice, sweet potatoes, and cotton, it neglected sugarcane production. Sugarcane not only did not complete the original planting plan, but also decreased by 40,000 mu compared to last year. At the same time, due to the relaxation of field management, the germination rate was low. Tea production in tea-producing areas also suffered because, while focusing on grain crop production, the arrangement of labor for tea picking was neglected, resulting in tea leaves staying on the trees without being picked, thus the province's spring tea output decreased by 4% compared to the same period last year.

The tendency to neglect comprehensive production increase has attracted the attention of party and government leading organs at all levels. Various localities, in conjunction with a comprehensive inspection of production, have re-arranged production according to the policy of comprehensive production increase and all-round leap forward, and have extensively launched movements to increase planting, interplanting, and relay planting to make up for loopholes in production. Nanchong, Neijiang, Yibin and other areas have recently mobilized farmers to make full use of abandoned land and wasteland such as field ridges, field edges, grave yards, and corners of houses to greatly increase the planting of soybeans, mung beans, and other minor coarse grains. The Suining area also mobilized farmers to interplant various coarse grain tall-stalk crops in corn and sweet potato fields. Peng'an County interplanted 270,000 jin of peanut seeds in cornfields, equivalent to expanding the peanut planting area by 9,000 mu. Farmers in Ziyang County universally planted a circle of peanuts around the edges of sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and other crops.

Some areas have also made arrangements to increase the planting of late autumn crops ahead of schedule. Ziyang County plans to increase the planting of autumn peanuts by 20,000 mu, which is expected to increase peanut production by more than 2.4 million jin. Yingjing County universally promoted the method of relay planting corn throughout the county, changing the original two-season corn to three-season corn, which can increase corn production by 300 jin per mu.

Specialized organizations have also been established in silkworm, tung tree, tea, and fruit producing areas to strengthen leadership.

    抓了主粮抓杂粮  大宗小宗齐跃进
    四川力争农业全面增产
    本报讯  四川省在农业生产大跃进中，注意贯彻全面增产的方针，争取达到样样增产，全面丰收。
    四川各地在农业生产大跃进中，普遍抓紧了粮棉等主要作物生产，却放松了对其他杂粮和经济作物生产的领导，或只注意主要粮食作物、大宗作物，而忽视了杂粮作物、零星作物。例如玉米是重要粮食作物，但有些地方只强调栽种红苕，挤掉了玉米，使玉米比去年播种面积减少一百多万亩。内江专区是甘蔗的主要产区，当地虽然抓紧水稻、红苕、棉花的增产，但却忽视了甘蔗生产，甘蔗不但没有完成原定播种计划，并且比去年还减少四万亩，同时因放松了田间管理，发芽率低。产茶区的茶叶生产也由于在抓粮食作物生产中，忽视了对采茶劳动力的安排，以致茶叶老在树上没有人去采，因而全省春茶产量比去年同期减少4％。
    忽视全面增产的偏向已引起各级党政领导机关的注意。各地结合生产全面大检查，按照全面增产、样样跃进的方针，重新安排生产，大量开展增种、间种、套种运动，以弥补生产上的漏洞。南充、内江、宜宾等专区，最近发动农民充分利用田埂、地边、坟园、屋角等废地荒土，大量增种黄豆、绿豆及其他小杂粮。遂宁专区还发动农民在玉米、红苕地里间种各种杂粮高秆作物。蓬安县在玉米地里间种的花生种籽达二十七万斤，相当于扩大花生种植面积九千亩。资阳县农民在甘蔗、红苕等作物地边周围，普遍增种上一圈花生。
    有的地区还提前安排增种晚秋作物。资阳县计划增种秋花生两万亩，预计可以增产花生二百四十多万斤。荥经县在全县范围内普遍推广套种玉米办法，将原来种植的二季玉米改为三季玉米，每亩可增产玉米三百斤。
    蚕桐、茶叶、水果产区，也都建立了专门机构，加强领导。
