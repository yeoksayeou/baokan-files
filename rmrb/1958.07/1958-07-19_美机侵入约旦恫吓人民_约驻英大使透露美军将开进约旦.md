Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Washington—The United States is stepping up the dispatch of troops to the Middle East and engaging in provocative activities, preparing for further armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

According to a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, more than 50 U.S. jet fighters conducted low-altitude "demonstration flights" over Jordan on the 17th. The spokesman admitted that this action was intended to intimidate the Arab people. He said that the flight was "for show" and its purpose was "to let everyone know that they (U.S. planes) have arrived there."

According to an announcement by the U.S. Department of the Navy, on the 17th, two more aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and sixteen destroyers arrived off the coast of Beirut. The number of U.S. ships stationed in the Beirut area has increased to forty-four.

The Department of Defense also said that the first airborne battle group of the 187th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 24th Division, transferred from West Germany, has fully arrived in Adana, Turkey. According to personnel at the NATO regional command in Izmir, the remainder of the 24th Division, totaling 11,000 men, will also arrive in a day or two and will be commanded by Holloway, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Task Force. Western news agencies say that these troops are only temporarily stationed in Turkey and will later be deployed to other parts of the Middle East.

In addition, there are reports that many U.S. transport planes are currently continuing to fly from the United States to Western Europe in order to transport more U.S. troops to the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 17th: The Jordanian Ambassador to London, Rifai, openly clamored today: "The King of Jordan has a responsibility to crush the Republic of Iraq."

Rifai also revealed that, like Britain, the United States is also using the so-called "invitation" of the King of Jordan as an excuse to prepare to invade Jordan. He said that it is expected that U.S. troops will arrive in Jordan "today or tomorrow."

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Nicosia—Britain today continued to airlift paratroopers from Nicosia to Jordan to threaten the national independence movement in the Middle East. As of noon today, two battalions have been transported to Amman. Both of these battalions belong to the British 16th Independent Parachute Brigade. The 16th Independent Parachute Brigade is notorious for having participated in the British invasion of Egypt in 1956.

    据美国国防部发言人说，美国五十多架喷气式战斗机17日在约旦上空低空“示威飞行”。发言人承认，这个行动是为了要恫吓阿拉伯人民。他说，这次飞行是“给人看的”，目的是“要让大家知道它们（美国飞机）已经到了那边”。
