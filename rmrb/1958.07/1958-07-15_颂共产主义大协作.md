Ode to Communist Large-Scale Collaboration
　　Zong Yi

According to scientists, the Soviet Union's launching of artificial satellites is inseparable from the close collaboration between various related sciences and scientists. This kind of collaboration is simply impossible in capitalist society. Collaboration will play an inestimably huge role in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Individuals and individuals, industries and industries, departments and departments, wherever appropriate and possible, should and must collaborate.

The atmosphere of collaboration is developing vigorously.

Recently, several comrades from the Jiangsu agricultural department who went to Shanxi to transfer wheat seeds were full of praise for the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. In addition to praising the sincere and amiable treatment of people by cadres at all levels and the general masses in the province, they were particularly moved by their spirit of collaboration. This year, four or five provinces, including Jiangsu and Shandong, asked Shanxi for "Zaoyangmai" wheat seeds. This is a high-yielding and fine variety, but Shanxi Province itself does not produce much of it, and the demand from the masses is very high. How should we deal with the requests from other provinces? Should we shake our heads and answer "no"? No. The Provincial Party Committee stated that "it would rather plant less itself to support fraternal provinces." The business departments immediately took action, full of enthusiasm, and did everything possible to tap potential. On the one hand, an appropriate portion was taken from the province's seed preservation amount to be allocated to other provinces; on the other hand, the masses were fully mobilized to sell seeds. The masses came up with soaring enthusiasm, with the slogan "Don't eat a single grain, sell it to the country, and support fraternal provinces." The problem was solved quickly, well, and satisfactorily, to everyone's delight.

Indeed, this matter fully embodies the noble communist style of "one for all, all for one" that has become prevalent since the rectification campaign. This communist spirit has brought about communist large-scale collaboration, making people regard other people's affairs completely as their own major responsibility. In the socialist family, with unified goals and doing the same cause, how can one distinguish between "me" and "others"?

Of course, it is not easy to completely eliminate the old-fashioned concept of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs" that exists in people's minds. Today, there are still many people who, when handling affairs, do not consider the overall interests of the socialist construction cause, and their thinking is far behind the times!

Let us praise communist large-scale collaboration and carry forward this new spirit in all our work.

    颂共产主义大协作
    宗义
    据科学家谈，苏联发射人造卫星，是和各门有关科学，以及科学家之间的紧密协作分不开的。而这种协作，在资本主义社会里则根本不可能。协作，对多快好省地建设社会主义，将起不可估量的巨大作用。个人和个人之间，行业和行业之间，部门和部门之间，只要适当和可能，都应该，而且必须协作。
    协作的风气，正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。
    新近，江苏农业部门几位到山西调拨麦种的同志，对山西省委赞不绝口。除了称赞该省各级干部，以及一般群众真诚待人，和蔼可亲，特别为他们的那种协作精神所激动。今年，江苏、山东等四、五个省向山西要小麦“早洋麦”种子。这是个高产良种，但山西本省生产还不多，群众需要量又很大；对外省要种怎么处理呢？是不是摇摇头答一句“没有”呢？不是。省委表示“宁可自己少种，也要支援兄弟省”。业务部门随即动了起来，热情满腔，千方百计地挖掘潜力。一方面，从本省保种量中，抽出适当部分拨给外省；又充分发动群众出售种子。群众拿出冲天劲头，口号是“一颗不吃，卖给国家，支援兄弟省”。问题解决的又快、又好、又圆满，皆大喜欢。
    确实，这件事情充分体现了整风以后普遍呈现的那种“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义高尚风格。这种共产主义精神带来了共产主义大协作。使人们把别人的事情，完完全全当作自己的重大责任。在社会主义大家庭中，目标一致，干同一个事业，怎么分得出“我”和“别人”来呢？
    当然，人们头脑中所存在的“各扫自己门前雪，休管他家瓦上霜”这样陈腐观念，要一下子完全扫尽，并不是很容易的。今天还是有不少人办起事来，不从社会主义建设事业的通盘利益着眼，他们的思想已经远远地落在时代的后面了！
    让我们颂扬共产主义大协作，并且将这种新精神在各项工作中发扬光大起来吧。
