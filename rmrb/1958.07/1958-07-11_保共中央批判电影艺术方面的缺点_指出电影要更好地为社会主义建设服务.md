Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 10th: To enable films to better serve socialist construction, the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee has criticized the shortcomings in film art. Bulgaria's film industry has achieved great development in the era of the people's government. In order to make the film industry better serve socialist construction, the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee recently made a resolution on the state of the film industry, pointing out the main shortcomings and future tasks of the current film art.

　　By the end of last year, Bulgaria had already produced twenty-eight feature films, more than the feature films produced during the sixty-six years of bourgeois rule before liberation. It is expected that eight feature films will be produced this year alone. Considering that Bulgaria only began producing its first feature film in 1950, the superiority of the socialist system is even more obvious.

　　Currently, a modern film studio with a total area of one thousand decares is being built at the foot of the beautiful Vitosha Mountain in the suburbs of Sofia. After the completion of this studio, it will be able to produce sixteen to twenty feature films every year. Many excellent films produced by the Bulgarian Film Studio profoundly reflect the heroic spirit of the working people in their past struggle against the reactionary rulers and their construction of socialism today, and are very popular among the audience. By the end of last year, there were already one thousand two hundred cinemas in urban and rural areas across the country, more than five times the number in 1944 before liberation. The number of moviegoers in 1957 increased by approximately eighty million compared to 1950. During this period, the number of rural moviegoers more than doubled.

　　The Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee's resolution on the film industry on the 8th pointed out that the main shortcomings in Bulgarian film art at present are: some film works show a tendency to pursue non-class abstract humanistic themes to a certain extent, obliterating and reducing the clear communist ideological content and Party spirit of the films. The resolution said that this shows that in recent years the creative activities of individual filmmakers have begun to move away from the people, away from the Party's principles and socialist realism, and have been influenced by film art viewpoints and methods that run counter to socialist realism. The resolution pointed out that Bulgaria's film art must continue to develop along the path of socialist realism that has been tested by life. Filmmakers must resolutely struggle against various revisionist attempts in film art, defend the method of socialist realism, and at the same time not weaken the struggle against dogmatism, formalism, and embellishing reality and other undesirable phenomena.

　　The resolution also emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the role of Party organizations in the film art sector and strengthen the political and ideological education of film workers. Party organizations in the film art sector should systematically study the main problems of film creation and create an atmosphere of profound thinking and free and critical study of film creation issues.

　　The resolution also mentioned that the films produced in the future should mainly take the real life of the working people in Bulgaria's urban and rural areas as the subject matter, reflecting the spiritual and moral outlook of the working people in building socialism. At the same time, it is also necessary to create films that vividly reflect the heroic struggle of the Bulgarian people against fascism and capitalism in the past under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

### 保共中央批判电影艺术方面的缺点  指出电影要更好地为社会主义建设服务

    保共中央批判电影艺术方面的缺点
    指出电影要更好地为社会主义建设服务
    新华社索非亚10日电　为使电影更好地为社会主义建设服务，保加利亚共产党中央批判了电影艺术中的缺点。保加利亚电影事业在人民政权的年代里获得了很大的发展。为了使电影事业更好地为社会主义建设服务，最近，保共中央就电影事业的状况作了一项决议，指出了目前电影艺术存在的主要缺点和今后的任务。
    到去年年底为止，保加利亚就已经生产了二十八部故事片，比解放前资产阶级统治的六十六年中所生产的故事片还要多。预计，今年一年就要生产八部故事片。如果考虑到保加利亚是从1950年才开始生产第一部故事片的话，那么社会主义制度的优越性就更明显了。
    目前在索非亚市近郊美丽的维多山麓正修建一个总面积为一千狄卡尔的现代化的电影制片厂，这个厂建成后，每年就可以生产十六部到二十部故事片。保加利亚电影制片厂出产的很多优秀影片深刻地反映了劳动人民过去同反动统治者斗争和今天建设社会主义的英雄气概，很受观众欢迎。到去年年底，全国城乡就已经有一千二百个电影院，比解放前1944年增加了五倍多。1957年的电影观众比1950年增加了约八千万人次。在这一时期内，农村的电影观众增加了两倍多。
    保共中央8日关于电影事业的决议中指出，目前保加利亚电影艺术方面的主要缺点是：某些电影作品表现了一定程度追求无阶级性的抽象人道主义主题的倾向，抹煞和降低了影片鲜明的共产主义思想性和党性。决议说，这表明了近年来个别电影工作者的创作活动开始远离人民、远离党的原则和社会主义现实主义，受了那些同社会主义现实主义相抵触的电影艺术观点和方法的影响。决议指出，保加利亚的电影艺术今后必须沿着经过生活考验的社会主义现实主义道路发展。电影工作者必须同电影艺术中的各种修正主义企图进行坚决斗争，捍卫社会主义现实主义方法，同时也不减弱同教条主义、公式主义和粉饰现实等不良现象作斗争。
    决议还强调指出，今后要加强电影艺术部门中党组织的作用，加强对电影工作人员的政治思想教育。电影艺术部门中的党组织要系统地研究电影创作的主要问题，创造一种深刻思考，自由地和批判地研究影片创作问题的气氛。
    决议还谈到，今后生产的影片，主要应该以保加利亚城乡劳动人民的现实生活为题材，反映劳动人民在建设社会主义中的精神和道德面貌。同时还必须创作能鲜明反映保加利亚人民过去在保加利亚共产党领导下反对法西斯主义和资本主义的英勇斗争的影片。
