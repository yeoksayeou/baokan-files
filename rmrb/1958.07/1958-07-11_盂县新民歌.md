Yu County New Folk Song

\tFull of energy, breaking through the sky,
\tOne kick knocks down Mount Wutai.
\tHeavy and light industries greatly develop,
\tGuaranteeing the construction of 2,300 factories.
\tBlast furnace smoke rushes into the clouds,
\tCoking flames are red in the sky.
\tSteel flowers bloom furiously in Yu County,
\tMolten iron flows into rivers.
\tRailways carry cars, circling the earth,
\tFarmers explore treasures all over the mountains.
\tIt is not Anshan and Taiyuan,
\tIt is originally a small county in eastern Shanxi.
\tIf you dare to think and dare to do, you can do it,
\tSmelting steel and iron is not difficult.
\tYu County people hold high the red flag,
\tRiding the wind and waves to strive for the lead.
\tStore the water in the sky,
\tDig out the underground springs.
\tEnergy plus drilling spirit,
\tWisdom plus courage.
\tStepping on the Yellow River to reverse the flow,
\tKnocking down Mount Tai as a pillow.
\tEveryone twists into one rope,
\tSwearing not to rest until the goal is achieved.

    盂县新民歌
    干劲十足冲破天
    一脚踢倒五台山
    轻重工业大发展
    保证建厂两千三
    高炉浓烟冲云间
    炼焦火焰红满天
    钢花怒放盂县山
    铁水奔流汇成川
    铁轨载车绕地转
    农民探宝遍山颠
    不是鞍山和太原
    原是晋东一小县
    敢想敢干就能干
    炼钢炼铁也不难
    盂县人民举红旗
    乘风破浪要争先
    蓄住天上水
    挖出地下泉
    干劲加钻劲
    智慧加勇敢
    足踏黄河水倒流
    搬倒泰山做枕头
    大家拧成一股劲
    不达目的誓不休
