    Small Millet, High Yield
    Over 2,000 Mu of Spring Millet in Wangkuai District, Fuping County, Hebei Province Yields 354 Jin Per Mu
    Two Mu of High-Yield Land Yields 1,350 Jin Per Mu
    Hebei Daily News: In the barren land with poor water conservancy conditions of the mountainous area of Fuping County, Hebei Province, the spring millet planted this year in Wangkuai District has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, overturning the long-held belief that spring millet is a low-yield crop. The 2,512 mu of spring millet planted in this district yielded an average of 354.5 jin per mu, of which 880 mu yielded 652 jin per mu, 62 mu yielded 914 jin per mu, 20 mu yielded 1,145 jin per mu, and 2 mu yielded 1,350 jin per mu. The main reasons for this district's success are the strengthening of cultivation management and the promotion of advanced agricultural techniques. After thawing this spring, the land was deeply plowed to a depth of 1.5 chi using hoes and mattocks; 80 dan of base fertilizer were applied per mu; sowing took place during the Qingming Festival, ten days earlier than in the past; 6 jin of seeds were used per mu, and a seed drill was used to sow in furrows, with a sowing width of 4 cun and a row spacing of 7 cun; when the seedlings grew to 1.5 cun high, single-plant thinning was carried out by hand in a staggered manner, resulting in 180,000 plants per mu. Generally, four applications of fertilizer, five irrigations, and four weedings were carried out, and 666 powder was used to universally control underground pests once.
    The bumper harvest of spring millet has greatly encouraged the people's enthusiasm. Some cooperatives are now replanting sweet potatoes and other crops in the millet stubble fields.

    谷子小　产量高
    河北阜平县王快区两千多亩春谷亩产354斤
    二亩高额丰产田亩产1350斤
    河北日报讯　在土地瘠薄、水利条件不好的河北山区——阜平县王快区，今年种植的春小谷获得空前大丰收，推翻了一向认为春小谷是低产作物的说法。这个区种植的两千五百一十二亩春小谷，平均亩产三百五十四斤半，其中有八百八十亩亩产六百五十二斤，六十二亩亩产九百一十四斤，二十亩亩产一千一百四十五斤，二亩亩产一千三百五十斤。这个区能得到这样的丰收，主要是加强了耕作管理和推广了农业先进技术。今春解冻后，用镢和铣深翻地一尺五寸；每亩施底肥八十担；清明节下种，比以往提早了十天；每亩用种量六斤，耠子开沟下种，播幅四寸，行距七寸；小苗长到一寸半高时，进行了手提交错单株定苗，每亩十八万株。一般的作到了四肥、五水、四锄、用六六六粉普治了一次地下害虫。
    春小谷在获得丰收后，大大鼓舞了人们的热情。现在有些社已在谷茬地里复种了甘薯等作物。
