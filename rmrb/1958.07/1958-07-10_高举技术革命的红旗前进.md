Advance High the Red Flag of the Technological Revolution

    Glass Fiber
    The Ningbo Glass Factory, a local state-owned enterprise, has successfully trial-produced its first batch of high-grade glass fiber.
    Glass fiber is one of the modern "cutting-edge industries." Products made of glass fiber have many unique properties such as being non-flammable, non-absorbent, soundproof, heat-insulating, high-temperature resistant, and corrosion-resistant.
    This glass fiber can be combined with plastic to be molded into fiberglass. The tensile strength of glass fiber and its products is more than twice that of steel wire. Glass wool is warmer than sheep's wool and more elastic than other fibers, making it an excellent material for thermal insulation and heat preservation. Due to these characteristics, it can replace raw materials such as steel, cotton cloth, silk, and asbestos in the manufacture of aircraft, ships, automobiles, and mechanical components.
    In the trial production of this product, the workers displayed their creativity. They overcame difficulties such as insufficient equipment and raw materials by using oxygen instead of gas, and handmade bobbin winders instead of drawing machines, finally succeeding in the trial production in less than two months.
    After the successful trial production of glass fiber, the factory decided to invest heavily in production. The preliminary plan is to produce 28,000 kilograms in the second half of the year, with an output value of 1.32 million yuan.  (Zhejiang Daily)

    New Type of Tires
    Employees of the Qingdao State-owned No. 2 Rubber Factory have recently successfully trial-produced four types of tires with the latest international technology. They are: waterless-cured truck tires, tubeless and flapless large truck tires, truck tires with steel spring treads, and truck tires with steel blade grooves in the tread. Preliminary assessments indicate that the quality of these products is good.
    Currently, all countries in the world install water bladders in tire carcasses during the vulcanization of automobile tires to prevent deformation during the vulcanization process. The factory's employees broke away from this old technology and boldly conducted experiments on waterless vulcanization of truck tires, which have been successful. The adoption of this new technology can eliminate the water bladder production process, saving a large amount of raw materials, labor, water, and electricity. According to the factory's production situation, it can save more than 500,000 yuan per year.
    The currently used automobile tires consist of three parts: an outer tire, an inner tube, and a flap. The tubeless large truck tires successfully trial-produced by this factory do not require inner tubes or flaps and can be used directly on automobile wheels. They also have many advantages such as driving safety, being less prone to bursting, generating less heat, having good heat dissipation, and strong airtightness.
    The truck tires with steel blade grooves in the tread have lateral grooves that are half a millimeter wide, thus providing a strong grip on the ground and preventing skidding on rainy or snowy roads. The truck tires with steel spring treads have three steel springs embedded in the tread rubber, making the tire tread wear-resistant and greatly increasing its service life.

    Refractory Materials
    Representatives attending the National Refractory Materials Production Promotion Conference in Chongqing, after on-site visits, believe that the production miracles created by the three advanced refractory material workshops of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company in the production of clay bricks and silica bricks are a major technological revolution in China's refractory material industry. These miracles are: the first and second refractory material workshops of this company have reduced the firing time of each batch of clay bricks from 60 to 80 hours to 9 to 10 hours; another refractory material workshop has reduced the firing time of each batch of silica bricks to 74 hours and 15 minutes. According to the information obtained at this conference, these records are not only the highest in the country but also the most advanced in the world.
    In the process of implementing rapid kiln firing, the employees of the first and second refractory material workshops of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company completely negated the dogmatic theory of the "heating curve," which is considered sacred and inviolable in the world's capitalist countries, and the mechanical operation methods. They proved that from the time the kiln is ignited to the time it is shut down, the firepower can be increased as much as possible, and the temperature can be raised as quickly as possible without any restrictions. The fired bricks not only do not crack but also have significantly improved quality, and the firing time is greatly shortened as a result.
    Silica brick is one of the most difficult refractory materials to fire. Therefore, the "heating curve" for silica brick firing is generally specified to be particularly complex and strict, with particularly many rigid rules and regulations. After breaking the superstition about the "heating curve" for firing clay bricks, the refractory material engineers and technicians of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, together with the workers of the refractory material workshop of the Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant, jointly experimented with rapid kiln firing of silica bricks. From production practice, they completely broke the rigid rules and regulations stipulated by the "heating curve" in silica brick firing and created the latest record of firing a batch of bricks in 74 hours and 15 minutes.
    Currently, the production of clay bricks accounts for approximately 70% of the total output of refractory materials in the country. The firing time for clay bricks in refractory material units across the country is generally over 60 or 70 hours; the firing time for silica bricks is generally over 140 hours. If all refractory material units across the country learn from Chongqing's kiln firing experience, the output of refractory materials across the country can be increased quickly.

    Surgery
    Medical personnel at the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical College have recently reached or exceeded international levels in the following surgical procedures.
    Surgical procedures that have reached or exceeded international levels include "removal of intracranial tumors." According to statistics from the American Journal of Neurosurgery, the mortality rate in the United States is 18%, but the mortality rate in 48 cases at the hospital is only 16%, and recently, with the use of hypothermic anesthesia, the mortality rate (14 cases) has been reduced to 7.1%.
    "Lung resection surgery" (including lobectomy, segmentectomy, and pneumonectomy). According to figures published in the American journal "Diseases of the Chest," the mortality rate is 1.95%, while none of the 70 cases at the hospital died.
    Esophageal cancer resection. The mortality rate at the hospital in 30 cases is 3.3%, which is much lower than the mortality rate for this surgery in general countries.
    Renal tuberculosis nephrectomy. None of the 120 cases died, exceeding international levels. Other procedures such as splenorenal venous anastomosis for portal hypertension (5 cases), total gastrectomy "double-lumen jejunal pouch" substitute gastrectomy (4 cases), ureterocolic transplantation (including total cystectomy for a total of 15 cases), etc., had no deaths.

    玻璃纤维
    地方国营宁波玻璃厂试制成功第一批高级玻璃纤维。
    玻璃纤维是现代“尖端工业”之一。玻璃纤维制成的成品，具有不怕烧、不吸水、能隔音、隔热、耐高温、耐腐蚀等许多独特性能。
    这种玻璃丝加上塑料，就可以压制成玻璃钢。玻璃丝及其制成的成品拉力要比钢丝高二倍以上。玻璃绵比羊毛还暖，比其他纤维弹性要大得多，是很好的隔热、保温材料。由于有以上特性，它可以代替钢材、棉布、丝、石棉等原料，制造飞机、轮船、汽车和机械的部件。
    工人们在试制这种产品时，发挥了创造精神。他们以氧气代替煤气、手工筒子车代替拉丝机等，克服了设备、原料不足的困难，终于在不到二个月时间内试制成功。
    玻璃纤维试制成功后，该厂决定大量投入生产。初步计划下半年就要生产二万八千公斤，产值达一百三十二万元。  （浙江日报）
    新型轮胎
    青岛国营第二橡胶厂职工，最近相继试制成功了四种国际最新技术的轮胎产品。它们是：无水胎硫化的卡车轮胎、无内胎无垫带的大型载重汽车轮胎、胎面带钢丝弹簧的卡车轮胎、胎面花纹带钢片沟的卡车轮胎，经过初步鉴定，这些产品的质量良好。
    现在世界各国在硫化汽车外胎时，都在胎坯中装上水胎以防止在硫化过程中变形，这个厂的职工打破了这一旧技术，大胆地进行无水胎硫化卡车轮胎的试验，并已成功。这一新技术采用后，可以取消水胎生产的工序，节约大量的原材料和人工、水电。按这个厂的生产情况，每年可节约五十多万元。
    现在使用的汽车轮胎，由外胎、内胎、垫带三样东西组成。这个厂试制成功的无内胎的大型载重汽车轮胎，不需要内胎和垫带，安在汽车轮上即可使用。而且还具有行驶安全、不易爆破、升热少、散热性能好、密闭性强等许多优点。
    胎面花纹带钢片沟的卡车轮胎，它的胎面上具有半公厘宽的横向沟槽，因此与地面的抓着力强，在雨雪路上行驶时不滑。胎面带钢丝弹簧的卡车轮胎，是在轮胎的胎面胶内做上三道钢丝弹簧，使轮胎胎面耐磨，大大提高使用年限。

    耐火材料
    在重庆出席全国耐火材料生产促进会议的代表们经过实地参观以后认为，重庆钢铁公司三个先进耐火材料车间在生产粘土砖、矽砖方面创造的生产奇迹，是我国耐火材料工业上的重大技术革命。这些奇迹是：这个公司的第一、第二耐火材料车间，已经把每炉粘土砖的烧成时间由六十到八十小时缩短到九至十小时；另外一个耐火材料车间，已经把每炉矽砖的烧成时间缩短到七十四小时十五分。根据这次会议掌握的资料证实，这些纪录不但是全国最高的，也是世界上最先进的。
    重庆钢铁公司第一、第二耐火材料车间职工在实行快速烧窑的实践过程中，完全否定了在世界资本主义国家中认为神圣不可侵犯的“升温曲线”的教条式理论和机械的操作方法，证明了窑炉从点火烧窑起到闭火止，完全可以尽量加大火力，尽量猛快地提高温度，不必受任何限制；烧出的砖不但不开裂，反而质量显著提高，烧成时间也因之大大缩短。
    矽砖是耐火材料中最难烧成的一种。因此，矽砖烧窑的“升温曲线”，一般都规定得特别复杂严格，清规戒律也特别多。在破除了对于烧粘土砖“升温曲线”的迷信以后，重庆钢铁公司的耐火材料工程师和技术员们，跟重庆第三钢铁厂耐火材料车间的工人们共同试验矽砖的快速烧窑，从生产实践中又彻底打破了矽砖烧窑中“升温曲线”规定的清规戒律，创造了七十四小时十五分烧一炉砖的最新纪录。
    目前粘土砖的产量约占全国耐火材料总产量的70％。全国耐火材料单位的粘土砖烧成时间，一般都在六十、七十小时以上；矽砖的烧成时间一般都在一百四十小时以上。如果全国各耐火材料单位都学习重庆的烧窑经验，全国耐火材料的产量就能很快提高。  （新华社）
    外科手术
    南京医学院附属医院医务人员，最近在下列外科手术方面，已经达到与超过国际水平。
    达到与超过国际水平的外科手术有“颅内肿瘤摘除术”，这项手术根据美国神经外科杂志统计，在美国的死亡率为18％，但该院四十八个病例中死亡率只有16％，而最近运用低温麻醉，死亡率（十四例）已降到7.1％。
    “肺切除手术”（包括肺叶、肺段及全肺）。据美国的“胸腔疾病”杂志发表数字，死亡率为1.95％，而该院在七十病例中无一人死亡。
    食道癌切除术。该院在三十病例中的死亡率为3.3％，比一般国家在这项手术上的死亡率要低得多。
    肾结核肾切除术。在一百二十个病例中无一人死亡，超过国际水平。其他如门静脉高压症脾肾静脉吻合术（五例）、全胃切除“双腔空肠袋”替胃术（四例）、输尿管结肠移植术（包括全膀胱切除共十五例）等，都无一死亡。
