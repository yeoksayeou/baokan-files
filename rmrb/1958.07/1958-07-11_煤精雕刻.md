    Jet Carving
    Shi Feng
    On the viewing platform of the Fushun Open-pit Mine, there are displayed some exquisite and unique, jet-black and shiny carvings. The raw material for these carvings is neither wood nor any kind of stone, but a special product of Fushun - "jet".
    Fushun jet carving has a history of fifty years. It was founded by an old wood carving artist from Beijing - Zhao Kunsheng. In the old society, Zhao Kunsheng was unable to pursue his beloved wood carving art, and was forced by life to wander to Fushun and work as a coal miner. In his work, he discovered "jet", and after research and experimentation, he was the first to use jet as a carving material. Since then, Fushun has had its own special art form - jet carving.
    After liberation, this art has been given new development under the leadership and support of the Party and the government. Now Wang Jichang, known as the "Jet King", has the best jet carving skills. In recent years, he has carved many excellent works, such as a single-tire, double-hitched galloping horse depicting the industrial production upsurge of 1956. Recently, he also carved a moving image of a young cadre taking off his leather shoes, putting on straw shoes, and preparing to go to the countryside for labor training.
    Jet carving is beautiful and unique, but it is afraid of severe cold and high temperatures. If it encounters extreme cold and heat, or is scalded with boiling water or exposed to the scorching sun, it will crack. To preserve jet carvings well, you should avoid extreme cold and heat, and it is best to apply a little lavender oil to it. This will make the jet carving look brighter and more beautiful the longer it is kept. (Attached picture)

    煤精雕刻
    时峰
    抚顺露天矿的参观台上，陈列着一些精美别致、乌黑发亮的雕刻。这些雕刻的原料，不是木质也不是任何石头，是用抚顺的一种特产——“煤精”雕刻而成的。
    抚顺煤精雕刻已有五十年的历史了。它是由从前的一位北京木刻老艺人——赵坤升创始的。在旧社会里，赵坤升无法从事自己爱好的木刻艺术，被生活所迫流浪到抚顺作了煤矿工人。他在劳动中发现了“煤精”，经过研究试验，他第一个用煤精作雕刻原料了。从此抚顺有了自己特殊的艺术品——煤精雕刻。
    解放以后，这门艺术在党和政府的领导扶植下得到了新的发展。现在以号称“煤精王”的王继昌的煤精雕刻技术最佳。几年来，他雕刻了表现1956年的工业生产高潮的一座单胎双匹奔驰的骏马等许多优秀的作品。最近他又雕刻了一个脱下皮鞋、穿上靰鞡准备下乡劳动锻炼的青年干部的动人形象。
    煤精雕刻，美观别致，但是它怕严寒和高温。如果遇到了奇冷和酷热，或用开水烫、烈日晒，都会破裂。要想保存好煤精雕刻，就应该注意避免大冷大热，最好再给它涂上一点香草油。这样就会使煤精雕刻越放得久越发亮好看。（附图片）
