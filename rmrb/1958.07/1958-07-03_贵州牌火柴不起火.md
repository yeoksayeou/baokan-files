    Guizhou Brand Matches Don't Light
    The "Guizhou" brand matches produced by the Zunyi Match Factory in Guizhou Province are of very poor quality. After being struck, they emit a puff of smoke and then go out. Not many matches in a box work properly, and everyone is unwilling to buy these matches. Our supply and marketing cooperative here has a lot of them stockpiled. Therefore, we suggest that the Zunyi Match Factory in Guizhou Province quickly find out the reason why the matches don't light and improve the quality of the matches.

    贵州牌火柴不起火
    贵州遵义火柴厂出产的“贵州”牌火柴，质量非常不好，擦着了后冒股烟就灭了。一盒火柴没有几根好使的，大家都不愿买这种火柴，我们这里的供销社积压了很多。因此我们建议贵州遵义火柴厂迅速找出火柴不起火的原因，提高火柴质量。
