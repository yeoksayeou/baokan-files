Ideological liberation through the elimination of superstition has become a popular slogan. What superstitions should be eliminated? Superstitions about the ancients, about foreigners, about book knowledge, about past experiences, about bourgeois professors, about experts, and so on. No matter how many forms superstition takes, fundamentally, it stems from a lack of faith in the masses and their subjective initiative.

How to treat the masses, whether one looks up to and trusts them, is the touchstone for judging whether a person is superstitious and the yardstick for measuring whether one's thinking is liberated. The people are the creators of history, and they possess boundless wisdom and creative power. This is relatively easy to understand in theory; anyone who has read a few basic Marxist works can expound on it. However, putting this view into practice is not so easy.

Some people pay lip service to the masses but disregard them in action. This is a discrepancy between word and deed, a divorce of theory from reality, and as a result, they inevitably become false Marxists or even counter-revolutionaries. Kautsky and Plekhanov can be taken as representatives of this type of person. Kautsky could be called a "learned man," capable of reciting all the works of Marx and Engels. But he had one shortcoming: he disliked the masses, was divorced from them, and preferred the bourgeoisie, following them as their tail. Therefore, he eventually turned from a false revolutionary into a complete counter-revolutionary. Plekhanov possessed extensive knowledge of Marxism and even wrote brilliant works on the role of the people in history. However, in revolutionary practice, he despised the masses and ended up betraying the revolution. In China's past revolutionary history, there have been several "leftist" and rightist opportunists. Although the circumstances of their mistakes were completely different, they were all, in one way or another, superstitious and arrogant people who did not see the masses.

Marx, Engels, and Lenin are the most outstanding examples of perfectly implementing the unity of theory and practice and genuinely believing in the power of the masses. In our country, Comrade Mao Zedong is also such a great figure.

The greatness of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought lies in its most perfect combination of the general principles of Marxism with the specific realities of China, and the key to this combination lies in truly believing in the power of the masses. In summary, the four words "mass line" can be said to be the essence of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to be revolutionary optimists, that no difficulty is to be feared, and that as long as we believe in the masses, there will be a solution. The history of our Party's leadership of the revolution proves a fundamental truth: that we should consult with the masses in everything we do, and follow the principle of "from the masses, to the masses." As long as we truly rely on the masses, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome.

During the revolutionary period, it was necessary to rely on the masses in fighting battles, to mobilize the masses in land reform and overthrowing the landlords, and to rely on the masses in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns and the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Movement. The mass line in these aspects is relatively easy to understand and accept. However, many people cannot understand why the cultural revolution and technological revolution in the current socialist construction great leap forward must also follow the mass line. Only through countless facts and lessons have people gradually awakened. People are increasingly seeing clearly that scientific and technological creation and invention are not something mysterious or unattainable. Achievements that are world-class and at the international level are not necessarily achieved only by experts and professors with extensive knowledge of both Chinese and Western learning. In our great country and great era, "miracles" are produced every moment. Many young people with little education and workers and farmers with low levels of literacy have become inventors and proponents of new technologies. Wheat can yield four or five thousand catties per mu, and tea can yield nine hundred catties per mu. Some experts do not even believe it, but the masses with infinite wisdom have the ability to create "miracles."

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us to connect with the masses, to learn from the masses, and to let the feelings of the masses penetrate our minds. If the feelings of the masses do not penetrate our minds, we will easily waver. The fact is indeed so. Why did "anti-rash advance" emerge a year ago? Why did some people not believe that the "Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program" could be realized? And why were there later "watching the tide faction" and "reckoning accounts after the autumn harvest faction"? This is because the thoughts and feelings of the masses had not penetrated the minds of some people.

The general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is a new development of our Party's mass line. This general line was not conceived by a few people sitting at home; it is the demand of tens of thousands of masses, it is the echo of the voice of the times.

Breaking down superstition and liberating the mind are necessary conditions for implementing the general line. To break down superstition, we must believe in the power of the masses and combine our thoughts and feelings with theirs. To solve this problem, it is of great significance to earnestly study Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

We should earnestly study the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and similarly, we should earnestly study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a serious mistake if anyone thinks that Comrade Mao Zedong's works are clear and easy to understand and that reading them once or twice is enough, and is unwilling to make painstaking efforts to delve into them deeply. Comrade Mao Zedong is a brilliant example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and of combining a serious spirit of principle with a lively spirit of originality. We should think about this: in the Chinese revolutionary movement, there were many people who were well-versed in the classics, but only Comrade Mao Zedong was able to provide correct answers to every important question of the Chinese revolution. What is the reason for this? Everyone can talk about the mass line, but only Comrade Mao Zedong and a portion of responsible leaders who have truly mastered Comrade Mao Zedong's thought and are engaged in practical work do it best. What is the reason for this? If we can explore problems in connection with reality and combine them with reality, then we will truly realize that Comrade Mao Zedong's works do indeed have infinitely rich content. It is wrong not to read the foreign classic works of Marxism, and it is certain to make serious mistakes if one does not read the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. The success or failure of the Chinese revolution is inextricably linked to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, and countless facts in the Chinese revolutionary history of the past thirty-odd years have proved that this is an irrefutable truth.

In these days when the sun of the general line shines over the motherland, we are more convinced than ever of the truth of the mass line adhered to by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we feel more urgently than ever the necessity of earnestly studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    由思想解放谈起
    王子野
    破除迷信，解放思想，已经成了通俗的口号了。迷信什么？迷信古人，迷信外国人，迷信书本知识，迷信过去的经验，迷信资产阶级的教授，迷信专家，等等。不论迷信的表现形式有多少种，但是从根本上来说，这都是由于不相信群众、不相信群众的主观能动性。
    如何对待群众，是否看得起群众和相信群众，这是判断一个人有无迷信的试金石，也是测量思想是否解放的标尺。人民群众是历史的创造者，人民群众有无穷无尽的智慧和创造力量，这从理论上是比较不难解决的，凡是读过几本马克思主义的基本著作的人都能讲一套。可是要在实践中贯彻这个观点，就不那么容易了。
    有一些人口头上要群众，行动上不要群众，这就是言行不符，理论脱离实际，结果他们必然变成假的马克思主义者，甚至成为反革命。这类人物可以拿考茨基和普列汉诺夫作代表。考茨基可以说是一个“饱学之士”，能够背诵马克思和恩格斯的一切著作。可是有一件事不好，那就是他不喜欢群众，脱离群众，而喜欢资产阶级，跟资产阶级作尾巴，所以后来终于由假革命变成彻底的反革命。普列汉诺夫对马克思主义具有渊博的知识，而且对人民群众在历史上的作用还写下了光辉的著作。可是他在革命的实践中是卑视群众的，结果也落了一个背叛革命的下场。中国过去革命的历史上曾出现过几次“左”倾的和右倾的机会主义者，虽然他们犯错误的情况全不相同，但他们都是这样那样的迷信家，都是眼睛中没有群众的狂人。
    完满无缺地执行了理论同实际的统一，真正相信群众的力量，马克思、恩格斯和列宁是最卓绝的典范。在我们的国家里，毛泽东同志也是一位这样的伟大人物。
    毛泽东同志的思想之所以伟大，就在于它是把马克思主义的一般原理同中国具体实际的最完满的结合，而这个结合的关键又在于真正相信群众的力量。概括起来讲，群众路线四个字可以说是毛泽东同志思想的精髓。毛泽东同志经常教导我们要成为革命的乐观主义者，任何困难都没有什么可怕，只要相信群众就有办法。我们党领导革命的历史证明了一条根本的道理，就是遇事同群众商量，从群众中来，到群众中去。只要真正依靠群众，天大的困难也解决得了。
    在革命时期，打仗要依靠群众，土地改革、推翻地主要发动群众，三反、五反、肃反运动要依靠群众，这些方面的群众路线是比较容易理解的，比较容易为人们所接受的。但是目前社会主义建设大跃进中的文化革命和技术革命也要走群众路线，这就有不少人想不通。只是由于无数的事实教训，才使人们逐渐觉悟过来。人们越来越看得清楚了：科学技术上的创造、发明，并不是什么神秘的、高不可攀的东西。世界第一、国际水平的成就，不一定是由学贯中西的专家、教授才能达到；在我们这个伟大的国家和伟大的时代里面，每时每刻都会产生“奇迹”。读书不多的年轻人、文化程度不高的工人和农民，都有不少成了发明家、新技术的倡议者。小麦一亩地能产四、五千斤，茶叶一亩地能收九百斤，有些专家听了还不相信，然而智慧无穷的群众就有创造“奇迹”的本领。
    毛泽东同志教导我们要同群众联系，要向群众学习，要使群众的感情深入到我们脑筋中来；群众的感情不深入我们脑子，我们就容易动摇。事实的确是如此，一年前为什么会出现反“冒进”呢？为什么会有人不相信“农业纲要四十条”能实现呢？以后又为什么会有“观潮派”、“秋后算账派”呢？这就是因为群众的思想情感没有深入到一些人的脑筋中间去。
    鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，是我们党的群众路线的新的发展。这条总路线不是少数几个人坐在家里凭空想出来的；这是千千万万的群众的要求，这是时代的声音的反响。
    破除迷信，解放思想，是贯彻总路线的必要条件。要破除迷信，就必须相信群众的力量，就必须把我们的思想情感同群众的思想情感结合起来。要解决这个问题，认真学习毛泽东同志的著作是有极大的意义的。
    我们应该认真学习马克思、恩格斯和列宁的著作，同样，我们应该认真学习毛泽东同志的著作。如果有人以为毛泽东同志的著作明白易懂，读一两遍就可以了，不肯下苦功去深钻，那是非常错误的。毛泽东同志是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合、把严肃的原则精神同生动的独创精神相结合的光辉榜样。我们应该想一想：在中国革命运动中，熟读经典的人并不少见，可是只有毛泽东同志能够对中国革命的每一个重要问题作出正确的答案，这是什么缘故呢？群众路线人人会讲，但是只有毛泽东同志和一部分真正掌握了毛泽东同志的思想的负责领导实际工作的同志做得最好，这又是什么缘故呢？如果能联系实际、结合实际去探索问题，那么就会真正认识到毛泽东同志的著作确确实实有无穷丰富的内容。不读马克思主义的外国经典著作是不对的，不读毛泽东同志的著作必定犯重大错误。中国革命事业的成败同毛泽东同志的思想有着血肉相连的关系，三十几年来的中国革命史上有无数的事实证明了这是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    当着祖国的上空照耀着总路线的太阳的日子，我们比任何时候都更信服了毛泽东同志所坚持的群众路线的真理，我们比任何时候都更迫切地感到认真学习毛泽东同志著作的必要。
