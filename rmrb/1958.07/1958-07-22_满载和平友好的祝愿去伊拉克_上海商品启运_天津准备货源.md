Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st – The first batch of goods from Shanghai destined for the Republic of Iraq has been loaded onto ships and set sail.

　　These goods include building materials such as tiles, glass, and plywood, as well as a significant quantity of fabrics, sewing needles, yarn, dry-cell batteries, and radios for household use.

　　The dockworkers at Shanghai Port responsible for loading this batch of goods were in particularly high spirits. They lifted and placed the goods gently, binding them extra securely. Veteran worker Yin Chunxi told reporters during a break from the busy loading and unloading that Chinese workers, having suffered long-term oppression under imperialism, felt particularly excited about the Iraqi people gaining independence. He also asked the reporter to convey his respect and congratulations to the Iraqi people across the ocean through news reports.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st – The Tianjin branch of the China National Instruments Import Corporation has listed an order from an Iraqi trading company for 11,000 dry-cell batteries for radios as the top priority in its export list, and is actively preparing the supply to ship them as soon as possible.

　　The person in charge of the Tianjin Foreign Trade Bureau told reporters: The friendly trade exchanges between Tianjin Port and the Arab countries and peoples of the Middle East are developing day by day. Trade between the two sides began after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, initially with only one or two countries, and has now expanded to all Arab countries. The total value of goods exported from Tianjin to these countries in the first half of this year was six times more than the entire year of 1950. Imports in 1957 were twenty times more than in 1950. The range of exchanged goods is extremely wide and is carried out on the basis of mutual assistance. For example, Arab countries provide Tianjin's textile industry with a lot of cotton, while Tianjin's textile machinery factories supply them with many textile machines.

    满载和平友好的祝愿去伊拉克
    上海商品启运  天津准备货源
    新华社上海21日电  上海港运往伊拉克共和国的第一批商品，已装船出发。
    这些商品中，有磁砖、玻璃、胶合板等房屋修建材料，还有较大数量的布匹、缝针、木纱团、干电池、收音机等家庭日常用品。
    负责装载这批货物的上海港的码头工人，心情特别愉快。他们轻抬轻放，把它们捆扎得格外坚实。老工人尹春喜在繁忙的装卸间隙告诉记者：中国工人曾经身受帝国主义的长期压迫，对伊拉克人民获得独立分外感到兴奋。他并且要求记者通过新闻报道，为他们向远隔重洋的伊拉克人民表示敬意和祝贺。
    新华社天津21日电  中国仪器进口公司天津分公司已把伊拉克共和国一家贸易公司的一批定货——收音机用的干电池一万一千个，列为各项出口货单的第一位，正在积极准备货源，尽量提前装船运出。
    天津市对外贸易局负责人对记者说：天津口岸和中近东各阿拉伯国家和人民之间的友好贸易往来，正在日益发展。双方间的贸易是从中华人民共和国建立后就开始的，最初只有一两个国家，现在已发展到所有阿拉伯国家。今年上半年从天津出口供应这些国家的商品总值比1950年的全年还多六倍。进口的商品，1957年比1950年多二十倍。交换的商品范围极为广泛，而且是在互相帮助的基础上进行的，如阿拉伯国家给天津纺织工业提供许多棉花，而天津的纺织机械工厂供应了他们许多纺织机器。
