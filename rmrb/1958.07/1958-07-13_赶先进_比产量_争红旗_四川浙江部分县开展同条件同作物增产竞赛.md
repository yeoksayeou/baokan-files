Catch Up with the Advanced, Compete in Output, Strive for the Red Flag
Some Counties in Sichuan and Zhejiang Launch Emulation Drives in Production of the Same Crops Under the Same Conditions

According to the Sichuan Daily News: Zhong County and Pi County, which are famous for achieving large-scale high yields of rapeseed this year, have decided to launch a great leap forward in production competition centered on rapeseed under the same conditions and with the same crops. Pi County put forward the slogan: "Learn from Zhong County, catch up with Zhong County in rapeseed production"; Zhong County put forward the slogan: "Learn from Pi County, catch up with Pi County in grain production." The two counties have decided to learn from each other and improve together. This was jointly agreed upon by Zhang Peiru, the First Secretary of the CPC Zhong County Committee, and Gao Yilu, the Secretary of the CPC Pi County Committee, at a symposium held by the Provincial Party Committee in Neijiang recently.

In Neijiang, the two counties introduced each other's situations and various experiences in increasing rapeseed and grain production. Both counties put forward next year's rapeseed production targets: Zhong County plans to increase production by 142%, with a yield of 500 jin per mu; Pi County plans to double production, with a yield of 300 jin per mu, and strive to catch up with Zhong County. The grain production competition will begin this year: Pi County plans to increase grain production by 25% this year, with a yield of 1,300 jin per mu, and plans to reach 1,500 jin per mu next year; Zhong County plans to increase grain production by 35% this year, with a yield of 926 jin per mu, and plans to increase production by 35% next year, with a yield of 1,250 jin per mu, and strive to catch up with Pi County and enter the ranks of high-yield grain counties in the province. Both counties have put forward measures to increase rapeseed and grain production next year based on their specific conditions.

In order to ensure the realization of the above plans, the two county party secretaries agreed that, in addition to effectively strengthening specific production leadership and mobilizing cadres and the masses to launch a new upsurge in production with greater enthusiasm, the two counties should strengthen contact and send cadres and the masses to visit each other two to four times a year to learn advanced farming techniques for rapeseed and grain. The two counties decided to introduce and adjust various improved varieties to each other and exchange newspapers and periodicals and documents related to production experience. Every summer and autumn, the two counties will conduct production summary and evaluations, summarize various production experiences, further strengthen production guidance, and better complete various production increase tasks.

Also, a great leap forward in production competition centered on rice has been launched between Luxian County and Jiangjin County.

Both Luxian County and Jiangjin County are grain-producing areas, especially famous for rice production, and have many things in common in production. Yang Yongping, the First Secretary of the CPC Luxian County Committee, and Ling Wenyuan, the First Secretary of the Jiangjin County Committee, recently consulted at a symposium held by the Provincial Party Committee. In the spirit of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, learning from each other, and improving together, they decided that the two counties would launch a great leap forward in production competition centered on rice within this year to promote the leap forward in production and work in the two counties, and mobilize all party members, cadres, and the masses to greatly overfulfill this year's production increase plan.

The two county party secretaries introduced each other's production situation. After full discussion, they put forward rice competition targets and production increase measures. Jiangjin plans to achieve a yield of 1,625 jin per mu for double-cropping rice (625 jin for early rice and 1,000 jin for late rice); Luxian plans to achieve a yield of 1,380 jin per mu for double-cropping rice (580 jin for early rice and 800 jin for late rice). In terms of production increase measures, the two counties believe that a bumper harvest of early rice this year is a certainty, and in the future, they should focus on doing a good job in late rice production and take various advanced measures to achieve a great leap forward in late rice production in every possible way.

The two secretaries also discussed the two counties' future contacts, evaluation, inspection, and other methods.

According to the Zhejiang Daily News: The counties in Jiaxing Prefecture enthusiastically responded to the revolutionary competition proposal put forward by Jiaxing and other seven counties and actively invested in the movement for large-scale high-yield and bumper harvests.

On June 28, Jiaxing County challenged the counties in Jiaxing Prefecture, and the counties immediately organized cadres to discuss the response. Wuxing County was holding a cadres' meeting and discussed the conditions for responding to the challenge overnight, unanimously expressing that they would surpass Jiaxing after the autumn. Other county party committees discussed while organizing township and commune cadres to discuss, and then mobilized the broad masses to discuss, and they all responded to the challenge.

In order to ensure the standard fertilizer of 400 dan to 500 dan per mu, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement was launched throughout the area, with generally 70% of the labor force invested in fertilizer accumulation. Jiaxing County, which proposed the competition, was full of energy, with 70% of the labor force accumulating fertilizer during the day and 100% invested in fertilizer accumulation at night. They put forward the fertilizer accumulation slogan of "collecting leaves from trees, scooping from rivers, scraping from the ground, and accumulating miscellaneous fertilizers at home."

In the competition, a upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced has been formed. Tongxiang and Chongde have long been linked in competition. Recently, after Chongde County learned about Tongxiang's merger experience, it immediately sent people to study. Deqing and Chongde are linked, and the township and commune cadres of Deqing County went to visit Chongde to understand the situation, expressing that they would speed up catching up. Jiaxing and Wuxing are linked in competition. When it was found that Wuxing's fertilizer accumulation exceeded Jiaxing's, Jiaxing County held a radio conference on the 5th with 250,000 people participating, calling for a concentrated fertilizer accumulation effort and determined to catch up with Wuxing.

    赶先进  比产量  争红旗
    四川浙江部分县开展同条件同作物增产竞赛
    据四川日报讯　今年以获得油菜大面积丰产著名的忠县和郫县决定开展以油菜为中心的同条件同作物的生产大跃进竞赛。郫县提出的口号是：“油菜学忠县、赶忠县”；忠县提出的口号是：“粮食学郫县、赶郫县”，两县之间决定互相学习，共同提高。这是中共忠县县委第一书记张培儒和郫县县委书记高义禄两同志，最近在内江于省委召开的一次座谈会上共同商定的。
    在内江，两县互相介绍了情况、介绍了增产油菜和粮食的各种经验，两县都提出了明年油菜的生产指标：忠县计划增产142％，亩产达到五百斤；郫县计划增产一倍，亩产达到三百斤，并力争赶上忠县。粮食生产的竞赛从今年就开始：郫县今年粮食计划增产25％，亩产达到一千三百斤，明年亩产计划达到一千五百斤；忠县今年粮食计划增产35％，亩产达到九百二十六斤，明年计划增产35％，亩产达到一千二百五十斤，并力争赶上郫县，跃入全省粮食高产县的行列。两县都根据本县的具体情况，提出了明年油菜和粮食的增产措施。
    为了确保以上计划的实现，两县县委书记议定，除切实加强生产的具体领导，动员干部和群众以更大的干劲掀起生产的新高潮外，两县要加强联系，每年互派干部和群众互相参观二至四次，互相学习油菜和粮食的先进耕作技术。两县决定要互相介绍和调剂各种良种、互相赠送本县报刊和有关生产经验的文件。每年夏秋两季，两县要进行生产的总结评比，总结各种生产经验，进一步加强生产的指导，更好地完成各种增产任务。
    又讯　一个以水稻为中心的同条件同作物的生产大跃进竞赛，已在泸县和江津两县之间展开。
    泸县和江津两县都是粮产区，尤以产水稻著名，生产上有许多共同的地方。中共泸县县委第一书记杨永平和江津县委第一书记凌文远两同志，最近在省委召开的一次座谈会上进行了协商，本着学先进、赶先进、互相学习、共同提高的精神，决定两县在今年内开展一次以水稻为中心的生产大跃进竞赛，以推动两县生产、工作飞跃前进，动员全体党员干部和群众，大大超额完成今年的增产计划。
    两县县委书记互相介绍了本县的生产情况，经过充分讨论，提出了水稻竞赛的指标和增产措施。江津计划双季稻亩产一千六百二十五斤（早稻六百二十五斤，晚稻一千斤）；泸县计划双季稻亩产一千三百八十斤（早稻五百八十斤，晚稻八百斤）。在增产措施方面，两县认为今年早稻丰收已成定局，今后应着重搞好晚稻生产，要采取各种先进措施，千方百计地实现晚稻生产大跃进。
    两位书记还讨论了两县今后的联系、评比检查等办法。
    据浙江日报讯　嘉兴专区各县热烈响应嘉兴等七县提出的革命竞赛倡议，积极投入大面积高额丰产运动。
    6月28日，嘉兴县向嘉兴专区各县发起挑战，各县立即组织干部讨论应战。吴兴县正在开干部大会，连夜讨论了应战条件，一致表示要在秋后超过嘉兴。其他各县县委一边讨论，一边组织乡社干部讨论，以后又发动广大群众讨论，纷纷应战。
    为了保证每亩四百担至五百担标准肥，全区轰轰烈烈地展开了积肥运动，一般有70％的劳力投入积肥。提出竞赛的嘉兴县干劲十足，白天70％劳力积肥，晚上百分之百投入积肥。他们提出“向树上采叶子，向河里捞，向地上削，在家里积杂肥”的积肥口号。
    竞赛当中，学先进，赶先进，超先进形成热潮。桐乡与崇德早就挂钩竞赛。最近崇德县了解了桐乡的并圩经验之后，立即派人去学习。德清与崇德挂钩，德清县乡社干部为了了解崇德的情况，特地去参观了一次，表示要加紧赶上去。嘉兴与吴兴挂钩竞赛，当发现吴兴的积肥超过嘉兴时，嘉兴县在5日开了有二十五万人参加的广播大会，号召突击积肥，决心赶上吴兴。
