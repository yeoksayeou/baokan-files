As a news reporter, what I first encountered in Beirut were: newspapers with countless blank spaces; citizens lined up in front of the telegraph office waiting to be searched; and the sounds of gunfire and artillery not far away. These are just initial impressions, but they quite accurately depict the current state of this world-renowned city.

Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, is a peninsular mountain city, facing the azure Mediterranean Sea and surrounded by verdant mountains. Coupled with its pleasant climate, it is indeed a beautiful city. In previous years, this time of year attracted tourists from all directions. But today, people are no longer in the mood to think about these things. What residents are concerned about is the serious struggle against imperialism and its agents, which has been going on for more than two months.

For more than two months, Beirut has existed as two distinct parts. On one side are the four districts controlled by the insurgent people: Basta, New Road, Musaitbeh, and Burj Abi Haidar. Although these districts are not connected, they are very close to each other, located in the central-western part of the city. Not far from Chamoun's residence are important government departments such as the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense, the Intelligence Department, the radio station, as well as the banking district and commercial center. The remaining parts are still under the rule of the Chamoun group.

For two months, the Chamoun group has used barbed wire, sandbags, tanks, armored vehicles, and sometimes even aircraft to surround and frequently attack the areas controlled by the insurgent people. However, the insurgent forces fought heroically and have been holding their positions, with the Chamoun forces unable to cross the line.

In the areas ruled by the Chamoun group, the atmosphere is tense. Many intersections have fortifications made of sandbags, and in some places there are armored vehicles and tanks stationed. Martyrs' Square in the commercial center, which used to be a parking place for various cars, is now filled with twenty or thirty military motorcycles and trucks, ready to move out at any time. Constitutional police soldiers armed with American-made carbines patrol the streets on motorcycles or trucks. At many street corners, armed fascist thugs from the National Socialist Party and the Phalange Party, who are kept by imperialism and the Chamoun regime, are performing police duties, all armed with new guns shipped from the United States.

Shops in Beirut are on a long-term strike, but due to practical needs, it is impossible to close completely. Since June, some shops in some areas have opened, but only temporarily. As soon as they hear gunfire or an explosion nearby, the shops pull down their iron gates. After the curfew begins at eight o'clock in the evening, only the sound of gunfire and artillery and the coming and going of military and police vehicles break the deathly silence of the city.

The Chamoun group, trembling with fear under the constant blows of the patriotic people, ordered that everyone entering any government department be searched. Therefore, there is often a long line in front of the telegraph office, made up of people who are sending letters and telegrams or who have mailboxes there to collect mail. Armed or plainclothes constitutional police search everyone from front to back, and also open bags and other items for inspection, sometimes arbitrarily checking citizens' notebooks and various documents.

The savage censorship of newspapers is also causing daily indignation among the citizens. Newspapers with views different from the government either have large blank spaces or are so riddled with deletions that they are unreadable. Even pro-government newspapers often have many blank pages.

However, the Chamoun group's various repressive measures, relying on the support of imperialism, cannot subdue the people. The opposition newspapers "Al-Siyassa" and "Beirut Al-Masa," which were closed by the government, are continuing to be published in areas controlled by the insurgent people. Moreover, many newspaper-selling children are selling these newspapers near areas controlled by the insurgent people. When the police come, they run into the areas controlled by the insurgent people.

People sometimes encounter a car on the street, with armed motorcycles leading the way and open jeeps carrying fully armed constitutional police protecting it from behind. That is the car of U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock. It is not difficult to understand why he is so afraid, because the Lebanese insurgent people shouted the resounding slogans "Oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine" and "Down with Imperialism" at the beginning of this uprising!

    贝鲁特速写
    新华社记者　金铿然
    作为一个新闻记者，我在贝鲁特首先接触到的是：开了无数天窗的报纸；电报局前面排着长队等候被搜身的市民；以及不远地方的枪声和炮声。这只是最初的印象，但也相当准确地勾画出这个举世瞩目的城市的今天景象。
    黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特是个半岛形的山城，前面滨临着碧蓝的地中海，背后围绕着青翠的群山，加以气候宜人，的确是个美丽的城市。往年这个时候，这里吸引着来自四方的游客。但是今天，人们再没有心情想到这些，居民所关心的是已经进行了两个多月的反对帝国主义和它的代理人的严重斗争。
    两个多月来，贝鲁特一直存在着界限分明的两个部分。一方面是起义人民控制的四个地区，即巴斯塔区、新路区、穆塞特贝赫区和布尔吉·阿布·哈伊达尔区。这些地区虽不是联成一片，但相距很近，位于市内中部偏西部分。离开夏蒙的官邸，政府的重要部门如总理办公厅、内政部、国防部、情报部、广播电台以及银行区、商业中心都不远。其余部分仍然是处在夏蒙集团统治之下。
    夏蒙集团两个月来用铁丝网、沙袋、坦克、装甲车以至有时用飞机，来包围并且经常攻击起义人民控制的地区，但是起义部队进行英勇抗击，一直坚守着他们的阵地，夏蒙部队不能越过雷池一步。
    在夏蒙集团统治地区，充满着一片紧张气氛。许多十字路口都有沙袋堆成的工事，有的地方还停着装甲车和坦克。商业中心的烈士广场，原来是停放各种轿车的地方，现在则停着二、三十辆军用摩托车和卡车，随时准备出动。端着美国制的卡宾枪的宪警士兵乘着摩托车或卡车在街上巡逻。在许多街口，帝国主义和夏蒙政权豢养的国家社会党和长枪党的武装法西斯党徒担任着警察的任务，他们都端着美国运来的新枪支。
    贝鲁特的商店都在进行长期罢市，但是由于实际的需要，不可能完全关门，6月以来，有些地区的商店已经开门，不过那也只是暂时的，听到枪声一紧或者附近发生了爆炸，商店就都拉起了铁门。晚上八点钟开始戒严以后，更是只剩下枪炮声和军警车辆的来往响声，来打破这个城市死一样的沉寂。
    夏蒙集团在爱国人民的不断打击下胆战心惊，下令对进入任何政府机关部门的人都要搜身检查。因此，电报局前面经常排着长长的行列，这些人都是去发信、发电报或者有信箱在那里去取信的。武装或便衣的宪警把每一个人从身前摸到身后，而且还打开皮包等物件检查，有时还任意查看市民身上携带的记事本和各种文件。
    新闻检查野蛮摧残报纸的情形，也天天引起市民的愤慨。同政府持有不同看法的报纸，每天不是开大块天窗，就是被删得百孔千疮，无法卒读。即使是亲政府的报纸，也经常出现许多空白篇幅。
    但是，夏蒙集团依靠帝国主义的支持而采取的种种镇压手段并不能使人民屈服。被政府封闭的反对派报纸“政治报”和“贝鲁特晚报”正继续在起义人民控制的地区出版。而且还有许多卖报的少年儿童在起义人民控制地区附近出售这些报纸，警察一来，他们就跑进起义人民的地区。
    人们在街上有时可以碰到一辆汽车，前面有武装摩托车开路，后面有载着全副武装的宪警的敞篷吉普车保护，那就是美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克的汽车。他这样害怕是不难理解的，因为黎巴嫩起义人民在这次起义开始时就喊出了“反对艾森豪威尔主义”、“打倒帝国主义”的响亮口号！
