Workers should learn multiple skills and become "all-rounders," that is, in addition to being proficient and skilled in their own trades, they should also learn the skills of several trades adjacent to their own. They should not be limited to one skill or position for life. This is an important step in the development of China's working class and an urgent need for the rapid, economical, and efficient development of our socialist industrial and transportation undertakings.

This movement has already begun in many places. Shen Xikai and Yu Changbo, advanced producers at the expansion site of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, proposed in March of this year: "Everyone should become an all-rounder, and every machine should perform multiple tasks." Employees of industrial and mining enterprises and construction enterprises in Shanxi Province also launched a "multi-skilled worker" movement throughout the province. More than 40,000 young workers in steel, machinery, and construction enterprises in Chongqing, employees of construction enterprises and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, employees of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, and employees in many other places have also successively launched activities to "specialize in one skill and strive for multiple skills." The experiences of these places have proven that after learning multiple skills, workers can develop more comprehensively technically, politically, and ideologically, giving full play to their subjective initiative in production and powerfully promoting the development of production and construction.

Some people say that as production develops, science and technology advance, and the degree of mechanization and automation of the production process increases, the division of labor becomes more and more refined. This trend of division of labor contradicts the learning of multiple skills, so they doubt whether workers can or should learn multiple skills. But in fact, the higher the degree of mechanization and automation in production, the finer the division of labor, the simpler and easier to learn each trade's technology, and the easier it is for workers to learn multiple skills. The benefits of workers learning multiple skills for the development of production are obvious. For example, the operating workers in the thermal power workshop, iron smelting workshop, and coking workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant could not do repairs in the past, and had to find repair workers even for minor machine problems. Recently, after only a short period of learning, they were able to handle all the minor repairs themselves, and soon they will be able to handle all the medium repairs. For example, in the past, many people felt that automobile manufacturing was very mysterious, but in the great leap forward this year, workers in dozens of automobile repair and assembly plants across the country broke down superstitions and manufactured automobiles, thereby greatly advancing China's automobile industry. It can be seen from this that, whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, doubting that workers can and should learn multiple skills is unfounded.

Workers mastering multiple skills is originally an inevitable trend based on mechanization, automation, and refined division of labor. In capitalist society, the division of labor in enterprises is very detailed, and workers who only know one trade are often threatened by unemployment. In order to make a living and avoid unemployment, workers have to learn multiple skills so that they can quickly switch to other enterprises when there is no work in this enterprise. Therefore, in developed capitalist countries, the diverse skills mastered by workers are involuntary and passive. Only under the socialist system has the situation fundamentally changed.

In the early days of the founding of our country, in order to meet the needs of the rapid economic development at that time, it was necessary to first enable workers to quickly master a skill and immediately put them into the battle line of production and construction when training new workers. However, the socialist system is fundamentally different from the capitalist system. In socialist society, the entire national economy develops according to plan, economic crises will never occur, enterprises will not go bankrupt, and workers will not be unemployed. However, due to various reasons, the development of various sectors of the socialist economy, and even of various workshops and trades within an enterprise, will often be unbalanced. From the perspective of the entire country, some industrial sectors develop faster, and some industrial sectors develop slower. From the perspective of an enterprise, some workshops, sections, or trades have stronger production capacity, and some workshops, sections, or trades have weaker production capacity. Moreover, new products, new raw materials, new equipment, and new technologies are constantly emerging, replacing old products, old raw materials, old equipment, and old technologies, which will inevitably strengthen the phenomenon of imbalance. These imbalances are constantly present. The old imbalances are overcome, and new imbalances appear. This is the law of development of general things. Due to the existence of this imbalance, people will also see such phenomena: some enterprises, workshops, sections, or trades are short of labor, and some enterprises, workshops, sections, or trades have surplus labor. In order to solve this contradiction, we need to make some necessary adjustments to the labor force between some enterprises, some workshops, sections, or trades in order to meet the needs of production development. That is to say, under the socialist system, the development of production further requires enterprise leaders to train workers to learn multiple skills in order to adapt to the constantly growing and changing actual needs. At this time, workers learning multiple skills is no longer to avoid unemployment, not for passive purposes, but to more actively promote the development of overall production.

Facts have proven that if our workers always only master one simple skill, and after working for many years are still the same as new workers, can only stick to one position, and cannot adjust to each other, then every time the product variety changes, production will certainly not be able to get on track quickly, and the phenomenon of labor being sometimes tight and sometimes loose, sometimes idle and sometimes busy, cannot be well overcome. Only when workers learn multiple skills can they be mutually adjusted at any time and place according to the needs of production development. For example, in the past, operating workers did not take care of repairs, and repair workers did not take care of operation. When the machine did not have an accident, the operating workers were very busy, and the repair workers were very idle; when the machine had a problem, the repair workers were very busy, and the operating workers were very idle. If the operating worker learns repair technology, he is both an operating worker and a repair worker. When the machine is running, he operates the machine, and when the machine needs repair, he does repair work. In that way, workers can fully play their role in any situation. We know that people are the most active factor in the productive forces. People changing from "single-skilled" to "multi-skilled," from only being able to exert their subjective initiative in a small range to being able to exert their subjective initiative in a relatively large range, means a further development of productive forces.

China's construction is developing at an unprecedented speed in history. A large number of factories and mines are being started every day, a large number of factories and mines are being put into production every day, and new industrial sectors are constantly being established. In order to meet the needs of construction and production, we must train a large number of diverse skilled workers in a short period of time. What methods should be used to train them? Running technical schools is one method, but the most important method is to train them in practice. The vast majority of our existing revolutionary cadres were trained in the practice of revolution and construction, and the vast majority of our existing employees were also trained in the practice of production and construction. Launching a movement to learn multiple skills among the masses of employees is a good way to train the technical strength of the working class in practice quickly, efficiently, and economically. In modern enterprises, the entire production process is an organic whole, and each workshop, section, and process is closely related. On the basis of being proficient in their own professional skills, workers can learn other skills related to the trade, so that they can grasp the regularity of the entire production process from near to far and from rough to fine. Comrade Mao Zedong said that understanding the overall situation will make it easier to use the local things. Workers learning multiple skills and mastering the regularity of the entire production process will not only be more conducive to improving their professional skills, better becoming the masters of machines, and more conducive to invention and creation and technological innovation, but also, coupled with the necessary spare-time cultural studies, can make themselves a technical backbone with both rich practical experience and theoretical accomplishment. For example, Huang Rongchang, a nationally renowned advanced producer in Chongqing, became the most popular technician in the entire factory after learning skills such as turning, fitting, planing, and milling, from an ordinary young carpenter. As long as we carry out the movement of learning multiple skills widely and persistently, tens of thousands of Huang Rongchang-style technical backbones will surely emerge.

Carrying out the movement of learning multiple skills can also open up a broad path for increasing the manufacturing capacity of mechanical equipment in a short period of time. The great leap forward in national industry and agriculture and the development of the technological revolution require the machinery manufacturing industry to supply a large number of modern industrial equipment and agricultural machinery. China's existing machinery manufacturing industry is far from meeting the needs. In order to quickly overcome this contradiction, accelerating the construction of the machinery industry is one way, and another way that is faster, better, and more economical is to make existing mechanical repair factories simultaneously undertake the task of mechanical manufacturing, and to simultaneously turn the mechanical repair workshops of existing enterprises into manufacturing workshops. This requires passing two levels. One level is to have machine operating workers learn repair technology and undertake as much of the machine repair tasks as possible, so that full-time repair workers can reduce repair tasks and free up their hands. The second level is to have repair workers learn manufacturing technology. The boiler and steam engine operating workers in the thermal power workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently learned small and medium repair technology, and can free up forty repair workers to participate in manufacturing. This year, they will be able to produce a batch of products such as water pumps and steam turbine blowers to support the construction of the factory and brother factories. It can be seen from this that the two levels of transitioning from repair to manufacturing are not difficult to pass. In particular, it is especially easy for repair workers to learn manufacturing technology. Because repair workers are already very familiar with the structure and performance of various machines and know the advantages and disadvantages of various brands of machines. They not only quickly master manufacturing technology, but also can concentrate the advantages of various machines and create very good products.

Carrying out the movement of learning multiple skills can not only improve the technical level of workers, create a large number of technical backbones, and meet the needs of the great leap forward, but also create favorable conditions for further improving the political quality and ideological level of workers. Existence determines people's consciousness. In the introduction to the essay "Dialectics of Nature," Engels analyzed why the natural scientists of the entire 18th century still regarded the earth and nature as fixed and unchanging things, saying: "This can only be explained by the division of labor that had formed and dominated natural science at that time, which confined everyone more or less to their own special department, and only a few people were not deprived of the ability to observe the problem comprehensively." This is the case in scientific research, and it is also the case in production. The division of labor in production is too detailed, and workers only master one machine or tool for a long time, only do one job, and only come into contact with a certain point of the whole thing, which can easily simplify their thinking, produce one-sidedness, only see the part, and not see the whole. Moreover, because a worker only learns one simple skill, it is easy to learn, so it is easy to promote some workers' complacency. They become proud after learning a little technology. Therefore, whether from an economic point of view or from an ideological and political point of view, we must learn to master multiple skills according to national needs and actual possibilities, and constantly improve our political and cultural level in order to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in our socialist construction.

### 工人要学会多种技术

    工人要学会多种技术
    一个工人要学会多种技术，要做“多面手”，就是说，除过精通、熟练本工种的技术外，还要学会同本工种左邻右舍的若干工种的技术，不要终身只通一艺，固守一职。这是我国工人阶级发展的一项重要步骤，也是多快好省地发展我们社会主义工业交通等事业的迫切需要。
    现在这种运动已经在很多地方开展起来了。太原钢铁厂扩建工地先进生产者沈锡凯、于长波等在今年3月间提出了倡议：“人人要成多面手，机器要作多种活。”山西省工矿企业和建筑企业的职工们也在全省开展了一个学习“多面手”运动。重庆市钢铁、机械和建筑企业的四万多青年工人、北京市建筑企业和石景山钢铁厂等企业的职工，青海石油勘探局职工，还有其他许多地方的职工，也先后开展了“精一求多，学习多种技术”的活动。这些地方的经验证明，学会了多种技术以后，工人们在技术上、政治上和思想上都得到比较全面的发展，充分地发挥了人在生产中的主观能动作用，有力地推动了生产和建设事业的发展。
    有人说，生产越发展，科学技术越进步，生产过程的机械化、自动化程度越高，生产的分工也越来越细，这种分工的趋势与学会多种技术是相矛盾的，因而怀疑工人能够学会或者应该学会多种技术。但是在事实上，生产中的机械化、自动化程度越高，分工越细，每一个工种的技术就越简单，越容易学，工人就越容易学会多种技术。工人学会多种技术，对于发展生产的利益是很明显的。例如石景山钢铁厂热力车间、炼铁车间和化焦车间的运转工人，过去都不会修理，机器出一点小毛病，也得找修理工人；他们最近只学习很短的时间，就能把机器小修活全包下来，并且很快就能把中修的活全包下来。又如以前一提起汽车制造，许多人都觉得很神秘，但在今年的大跃进声中，全国就有几十个汽车修配厂的工人，破除了迷信，把汽车制造了出来，从而使我国的汽车工业大大前进一步。由此可见，从理论上讲也好，从实践上讲也好，怀疑工人能够和应该学会多种技术，都是没有根据的。
    工人掌握多种技术，这本来是机械化自动化和精细分工基础上的一种必然趋势。在资本主义社会里，企业的工种分得很细，只会一种工种的工人常常会受到失业的威胁。工人们为了便于谋生，为了避免失业，不得不学会多种技术，以便在这个企业没有活干的时候，能够很快地转到别的企业去。所以，在资本主义发达的国家里，工人掌握的技术多种多样，是不得已的，被动的。只有在社会主义制度下，情况才发生了根本变化。
    在我国建国初期，为了满足当时经济迅速发展的需要，在培养新工人的时候，不得不首先使工人很快地掌握一种技术，马上投到生产建设的战线上去。但是，社会主义制度跟资本主义制度根本不同。在社会主义社会里，整个国民经济按计划地发展着，经济危机永远不会出现，企业不会倒闭，工人不会失业。可是由于种种原因，社会主义经济各部门以至在一个企业内部各车间各工种的发展也会经常出现不平衡。从整个国家来看，有些工业部门发展得快一些，有些工业部门发展得慢一些。从一个企业来看，有些车间、工段或工种的生产能力强一些，有些车间工段或工种的生产能力弱一些。而且，新的产品、新的原料、新的装备、新的技术不断地出现着，代替着旧的产品、旧的原料、旧的装备、旧的技术，这也不可避免地要加强不平衡的现象。这些不平衡现象是经常存在着的，旧的不平衡克服了，新的不平衡又出现。这是一般事物的发展规律。由于这种不平衡的存在，人们也会看到这样的现象：有些企业、车间、工段或工种的劳动力紧张，有些企业、车间、工段或工种的劳动力有余。为了解决这种矛盾，就需要我们对一些企业、一些车间、工段或工种之间的劳动力经常进行一些必要的调整，才能适应生产发展的需要。这就是说，在社会主义制度下，生产的发展进一步要求企业领导上培养工人学会多种技术，学会多种技术，以适应不断增长和变化着的实际需要。这个时候工人们学会多种技能，再也不是为了避免失业，不是为了消极的目的，而是为了更积极地推动全面生产的发展。
    事实证明，如果我们的工人始终都只会掌握一种简单的技术，干了许多年还是同新工人一样，只能固守一职，不能互相调剂，那末，每当改变产品品种的时候，生产就一定不能很快地上轨道，劳动力一松一紧、一闲一忙的现象也不能很好地克服。只有当工人学会了多种技术，才可以随时随地根据生产的发展需要，实行互相调剂。例如，过去运转工人不管修理，修理工人不管运转，当机器不发生事故的时候，运转工人就很忙，修理工人就很闲；当机器出了毛病的时候，修理工人就很忙，运转工人就很闲。要是运转工人学会修理技术，他本身既是运转工人又是修理工人，机器运转的时候就操纵机器，机器需要修理的时候就做修理活。那样，工人在任何情况下，都能充分发挥自己的作用。我们知道，人是生产力中最活跃的因素。人从“单面手”变成“多面手”，从只能在一个狭小的范围里发挥主观能动作用变成在比较大的范围里发挥主观能动作用，这就意味着生产力的进一步发展。
    我国建设事业正以历史上没有过的高速度发展着。每天都有大批工厂和矿山动工兴建，每天都有大批工厂和矿山投入生产，并且不断有新的工业部门建立起来。为了满足建设和生产的需要，我们必须在短期间内培养出大批的多种多样的技术工人。用什么办法来培养呢？办技工学校，是一个办法，但是最主要的办法是在实践中培养。我们现有的绝大多数革命干部是在革命和建设的实践中培养出来的，我们现有的绝大多数职工也是在生产和建设的实践中培养出来的。在职工群众中开展学习多种技术运动，就是又多又快又好又省地在实践中培养工人阶级的技术力量的好办法。在现代企业里，整个生产过程是一个有机的整体，各个车间、工段、工序都有着密切的联系。工人在精通自己的专业技术的基础上，同时学会有关工种的其他技术，就可以由近及远、由粗到精地掌握整个生产的规律性。毛泽东同志说过，懂得了全局性的东西，就更会使用局部性的东西。工人学会多种技术，掌握了整个生产的规律性，一方面就更有利于提高自己的专业技术，更好地做机器的主人，更有利于进行发明创造和技术革新。另一方面，再加上必要的业余文化学习，就可以使自己成为一个既有丰富的实践经验，又有理论修养的技术骨干。例如重庆市全国著名的先进生产者黄荣昌，学会了车、钳、刨、铣等技术以后，就从一个普通的青年木工变成最受全厂职工欢迎的技师了。只要我们把学习多种技术的运动，广泛地、持久地开展下去，就一定会涌现出数以万计的黄荣昌式的技术骨干来。
    开展学习多种技术的运动，还可以为在短期内增加机械设备制造能力开辟一条广阔的道路。全国工农业的大跃进，技术革命的开展，要求机械制造工业供应大批的现代工业设备和农业机械。我国现有的机械制造工业远远不能满足需要。为了迅速地克服这个矛盾，加速机械工业的建设是一条道路，另外，还有一条又快又好又省的道路，就是使现有的机械修配工厂同时担负机械制造的任务，把现有企业的机械修理车间同时变为制造车间。这要过两道关。一道关是要机器运转工人学会修理技术，尽可能地把机器修理任务承担起来，使专职的修理工人减少修理任务腾出手来。二道关是要修理工人学会制造技术。石景山钢铁厂热力车间锅炉和汽机的运转工人，最近学会了小修和中修的技术以后，就可以腾出四十名修理工人去参加制造。今年他们就可以制出一批水泵和汽轮鼓风机等产品来，支援本厂和兄弟工厂的建设。由此可见，从修理转到制造的两道关并不难过。特别是修理工人学会制造技术尤其容易。因为修理工人本来就很熟悉各种机器的构造和性能，知道各种牌子的机器的长处和短处。他们不仅很快地掌握制造技术，并且还可以把各种机器的优点集中起来，造出很好的产品。
    开展学习多种技术运动，不仅能够提高工人的技术水平，造就大批的技术骨干，满足大跃进的需要，并且还能够为进一步提高工人的政治素质和思想水平创造有利条件。存在决定着人的意识。恩格斯在“自然辩证法”论文的导言中，分析为什么整个十八世纪的自然科学家仍然把地球和自然界看作是固定不变的东西的时候，说：“这只有用当时在自然科学中已形成的占统治地位的分工来说明，它使每个人或多或少地局限在自己的特殊的部门，只有少数人没有被它夺去全面观察问题的能力。”科学研究上是这样，生产上也是这样。生产中的分工过细，工人长期地只掌握一种机器或工具，只做一种活，只接触整个事物的某一点，这就很容易会使思想简单化，产生片面性，只看见局部，看不见整体，而且因为一个工人只学一种简单的手艺，很容易学会，因而就很容易助长一些工人的自满情绪，学会了一点技术就骄傲起来，因此无论从经济方面着想，无论从思想政治方面着想，我们都必须根据国家需要和实际可能，学会掌握多种技术，不断提高我们的政治文化水平，以适应我国社会主义建设大跃进的需要。
