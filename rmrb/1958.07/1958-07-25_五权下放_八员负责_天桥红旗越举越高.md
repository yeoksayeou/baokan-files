Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. Reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports: Based on the revolutionary initiative to improve commercial work, the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing has seen a brand new situation of everyone participating in management, everyone innovating technology, and continuously improving service quality.

　　The Tianqiao Department Store has implemented the delegation of five powers and the "eight personnel responsibility system," delegating the five powers of fund utilization, disposal of defective products, property loss, expense expenditure, and labor force allocation to the groups; at the same time, within the groups, work is divided among personnel based on eight tasks: personnel management, financial planning, sales promotion, purchasing, service attitude inspection, pricing and errors, general affairs, and hygiene and commodity display. This ensures that within the groups, everyone has a specific responsibility and everyone has something to do. The store's business management level has improved significantly. The initiative in February proposed reducing commodity funds from 320,000 yuan in 1957 to 200,000 yuan, and now it has been reduced to 155,000 yuan. The number of goods sold has increased by more than 1,200 varieties. Operating and management costs have also decreased.

　　Currently, the staff of the entire department store generally have mastered the knowledge of the main commodities of their own and other related groups; they have learned some necessary repair techniques, and mastered one or more management skills, and implemented a work method using cards instead of books. This not only relieved the burden of salespersons in terms of procedures and systems, reducing the procedural links from purchasing to sales from the original 40 to 15; it also reduced the labor intensity of accounting personnel, with the work originally done by five people now being completed by half a person.

　　The Tianqiao Department Store's continuous leaps forward are mainly due to putting politics in command, strengthening political and ideological work, and timely criticizing and educating some unhealthy ideological tendencies, so that employees can make simultaneous leaps forward in their thinking and work.

    五权下放　八员负责
    天桥红旗越举越高
    据新华社23日讯　记者张志清报道：北京天桥百货商场在实现改进商业工作的革命倡议的基础上，又出现了人人参加管理、人人革新技术、服务质量再提高的崭新局面。
    天桥百货商场实行了五权下放，小组八员负责制，将资金使用、残品处理、财产损失、费用开支、劳动力调配五项权力下放到小组；同时在小组按人事管理、财务计划、推销、进货、服务态度检查、物价和差错、总务、卫生和商品陈列等八项工作按人分工。这样在小组里做到了事事有专责，人人有事作。商场的经营管理水平有了显著提高。今年2月倡议中提出商品资金由1957年的三十二万元压缩到二十万元，现在已降低到十五万五千元。出售的商品增加一千二百多种。经营管理的费用也降低了。
    现在，全商场的职工一般都已经掌握了本组和其他有关小组的主要商品的知识；学会了一些必要的修理技术，学会了一种或多种管理业务的本领，实行了以卡片代账的工作方法。这样不仅解除了售货员在手续制度上的负担，从进货到销货的手续环节由原来四十道减少为十五道；同时也减轻了会计人员的劳动强度，原来五个人的工作，现在半个人就可以完成。
    天桥百货商场工作所以不断跃进，主要是政治挂帅，加强了政治思想工作，对一些不良思想倾向及时进行了批判和教育，使职工们思想上、工作上同时跃进。
