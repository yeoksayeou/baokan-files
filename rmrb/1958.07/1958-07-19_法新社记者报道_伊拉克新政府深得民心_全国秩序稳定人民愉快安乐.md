Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: A dispatch from a French Press Agency reporter from Baghdad on the 17th acknowledged that the newly established government of the Republic of Iraq has been warmly embraced by the people, with stable social order and a joyful and happy populace nationwide.

He wrote: Iraq’s "successful military coup began at dawn on July 14th, with the army taking over all public buildings in Baghdad within two hours.

"A three-member Supreme Power Committee has been formed to assume the powers of the head of state, under the leadership of General Najib al-Ruba'i, the former Iraqi Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Ruba'i returned here from Jeddah yesterday morning and is known to be an Iraqi officer in favor of strengthening ties between Arab countries.

"The most important fact about this revolution is that the people have shown great enthusiasm and support for it, and it appears to be entirely a domestic affair.

"Life in Baghdad is now normal, and the markets and shopping centers (including foreign department stores) have now begun to open. There is no shortage of food supplies. The new regime appears to be enjoying extraordinary, jubilant support from the people. Since the first day of the revolution, I have been free to walk around and have seen crowds of cheering people dancing and singing."

    据新华社18日讯  法新社记者17日从巴格达发出的一条电讯，承认新成立的伊拉克共和国政府得到人民的热烈拥护，全国社会秩序稳定，人民愉快欢乐。
    他写道：伊拉克“成功的陆军政变是在7月14日黎明开始的，陆军在两小时之内就接管了巴格达的一切公共建筑物。
    “一个三人最高权力委员会已经成立，以承担国家元首的权力，这个委员会是在前伊拉克驻沙特阿拉伯大使纳吉布·鲁巴伊将军的领导之下。鲁巴伊昨天上午从吉达回到这里，大家都知道他是赞成加强阿拉伯国家之间的联系的一位伊拉克军官。
    “关于这次革命的最重要的事实是：人民表现得很热情并支持革命，这次革命看来完全是内政。
    “巴格达的生活现在是正常的，市场和商店中心（其中包括外国百货商店在内）现在已经开始营业。食品供应并不缺乏。新政权看来是得到人民的异乎寻常的、兴高采烈的支持的。自从革命的第一天以来，我可以自由地到处走，我看到了成群的欢呼的人们跳着舞唱着歌。”
