    The Austrian State Treaty (i.e., the Austrian Peace Treaty) was signed in Vienna on May 15, 1955, by representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Austria. It affirmed the memorandum signed by representatives of the Soviet government and the Austrian government in April, which stipulated that Austria would issue a declaration of permanent neutrality after the treaty came into effect.

    The Austrian State Treaty came into effect on July 27, 1955. On October 26 of the same year, the Austrian Parliament passed the Federal Constitutional Law on Neutrality. Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates: "For the purpose of firmly establishing its external independence and ensuring the inviolability of its territory, Austria voluntarily declares its permanent neutrality. Austria will exert all its efforts to maintain and defend this neutral status."

    The Austrian government notified the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France regarding this neutral Federal Constitutional Law. The four governments, in turn, replied to Austria, deciding to recognize Austria's permanent neutrality.

    奥地利和约和中立
    1955年5月15日，苏、美、英、法和奥地利代表在维也纳签署了奥地利国家条约（即对奥和约），并肯定苏联政府和奥地利政府双方代表在4月会谈中所签署的备忘录，备忘录指明奥地利将在和约生效后，发表永久保持中立的宣言。
    1955年7月27日，对奥和约生效，同年10月26日，奥地利议会通过了中立的联邦宪法。宪法中第一条规定：奥地利为了坚定地确立它的对外独立和确保它的领土的不可侵犯性，兹自愿宣布它永久中立。奥地利将竭尽全力维护和保卫这种中立地位。
    奥地利政府曾就这一中立联邦宪法照会苏、美、英、法各国，四国政府并分别复照奥地利，决定承认奥地利永久中立。
