    Jishui Has Both Tungsten and Cobalt

    In developing local industry, Jishui County, Jiangxi Province, broke the mysterious concept of prospecting and fully relied on the masses to find mineral resources. In just over twenty days, they discovered more than 100 mineral deposits of various types. In addition to large amounts of iron, coal, limestone, etc., these mineral deposits also contain many valuable ores such as tungsten, cobalt, manganese, crystal, mica, lead, and magnetite. These mines are not only rich in reserves but also of high quality. According to preliminary tests, there are twenty-two iron ore deposits with an iron content of more than 50%, and there is also crystal with very high transparency. (Lei Lixing)

    吉水有钨又有钴
    江西省吉水县在发展地方工业中，打破探矿神秘观念，充分依靠群众寻找矿源，仅仅二十多天时间，发现各种矿藏一百多处。这些矿藏中除了大量铁、煤、石灰石等以外，还有不少贵重矿石，如钨、钴、锰、水晶石、云母、铅、磁铁等。这些矿不仅蕴藏丰富，而且品位很高。据初步化验，含铁量在50％以上的铁矿就有二十二处，还有透明度很高的水晶。　（雷力行）
