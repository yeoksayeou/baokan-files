Recommending Modern Theme Opera Productions
"An Actor's Diary" Has Universal Educational Significance
Xiang Su
From the title, the Shanghai opera "An Actor's Diary" seems to be only about the lives, thoughts, and struggles of actors, and its educational significance for the general audience seems limited. However, after watching the performance by the Shanghai People's Shanghai Opera Troupe, I deeply felt that the educational significance of this play far exceeds its title. The strongest impression it gives is: the bourgeois individualistic ideology is truly dangerous, and it must be reformed!

"An Actor's Diary" depicts the anti-Rightist struggle in a theater troupe. The play prominently portrays the serious arrogance and personal fame-seeking thoughts of the actress Liu Yurong, and how she is used and drawn in by Rightists, developing to the point of almost degenerating into a Rightist. The play uses vivid facts to educate people: individualistic thinking is the easiest loophole for the enemy to exploit. If you are arrogant and cause disunity, or if your individualistic desires are not satisfied and you have some dissatisfaction with the Party, the enemy will come to provoke and add fuel to the fire; if you compete for fame and profit, the enemy will take the opportunity to cater to your preferences, praise you, and pull you, luring you to take the road of opposing the Party and opposing socialism... The law of ideological development of Liu Yurong greatly inspires people's consciousness in reforming individualistic thinking. This is the most universally educational point. In addition, the play also depicts the process of another actress, Chen Zhihua, being tempered in the struggle, from confusion to awakening; it depicts the combination of Rightists and bad elements; and it depicts the Rightists deceiving and corrupting young people, all of which can educate people about class struggle. It is also worth pointing out that the play can embody the Party's policy in the anti-Rightist struggle, enhancing the play's ideological content.

This play, which reflects the struggle between two roads, is also very interesting. Through scenes such as the performance taking place on the stage while a fierce struggle is going on backstage, it cleverly allows the audience to understand that today, no one can be outside the struggle between the two roads. Only by consciously participating in this struggle is the only correct attitude.

Ding Shi'e, who plays Chen Zhihua in this play, Shi Xiaoying, who plays Liu Yurong, and Xie Hongyuan, who plays the Rightist Si Kongde, performed very well. They clearly portrayed the faces of three different characters, leaving a deep impression on the audience.

I feel that this play still has some shortcomings. The images of some positive characters are not vivid enough, such as the head of the troupe and secretary of the Party branch, the Party member playwright Lu Bing, and the activist Liu Xiaorong, etc., which do not leave a deep impression. In addition, the connection between the fourth and fifth scenes is not tight. After watching the fourth scene, many viewers thought that the play was over. The mood of Liu Yurong's fear of being labeled as a Rightist in the last scene is expressed too much. Wouldn't it be better to focus on showing that after education, she realized the harm of individualistic thinking and was determined to reform herself?

    推荐现代题材戏曲剧目
    “演员日记”有普遍教育意义
    向苏
    从剧名上看，沪剧“演员日记”好像说的只是演员的生活、思想和斗争，对广大观众的教育意义似乎有限；其实不然，我去看了上海市人民沪剧团的演出以后，深感这出戏的教育意义大大超出它的剧名，它给人最强烈的印象是：资产阶级个人主义思想真危险，不改造可不得了！
      “演员日记”是描写一个剧团里的反右派斗争。戏里突出地描写了女演员刘玉蓉严重的骄傲情绪和个人名利思想，如何被右派分子利用和拉拢，一直发展到快要堕落成为右派的地步。戏中以活生生的事实教育人们：个人主义思想是最容易被敌人钻的空子。你骄傲闹不团结，或个人主义得不到满足而对党有些不满，敌人就来挑拨离间，火上加油；你争名夺利，敌人就乘机投你所好，捧你拉你，引诱你向反党反社会主义的道路上走……。刘玉蓉的思想发展规律，大大启发了人们改造个人主义思想的自觉性。这就是最有普遍教育意义的一点。此外，戏中还描写了另一个女演员陈芝华在斗争中受到锻炼，从迷茫到觉醒的过程；描写了右派分子和坏分子结合在一起；描写了右派分子欺骗和腐蚀青年等，都能使人从中受到阶级教育。还值得特别指出的是，剧中能够体现党在反右派斗争中的政策，增强了这出戏的思想性。
    这出反映两条道路斗争，也很有意思。它通过前台正在演戏、后台却在进行激烈的斗争等场面，巧妙地让观众领悟到：今天，任何人都不可能置身于两条道路的斗争之外，只有自觉地参加这一斗争，才是唯一正确的态度。
    在这出戏中扮演陈芝华的丁是娥、扮演刘玉蓉的石筱英、扮演右派分子司空德的解洪元，演得很好，他们把三种不同人物的面貌清晰地刻划出来了，留给观众深刻的印象。
    我感到这出戏还有一些缺点。有些正面人物的形象刻划得不够生动，如剧团团长兼党支部书记、党员编剧鲁兵和积极分子刘小蓉等，给人的印象不深。另外，第四、五场间衔接不紧，看了第四场，许多观众都以为戏到此演完了。最后一场刘玉蓉害怕戴上右派帽子的心情表现得过多，如能着重表现她经过教育，觉悟到个人主义思想的危害性，下决心改造自己，岂不更好？
