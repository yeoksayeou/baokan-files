    "My Mother and I..."
    An Ji-yu, Hele First Cooperative, Jinning, Yunnan

    The room was packed with people, all taking advantage of their rest time to evaluate work points. Aunt Chen, Aunt He... one after another, they had just finished reporting their respective workloads when the voice of my landlady, Aunt Tang, came from the corner of the room: "And mine and my mother's..." People turned to look at her. Someone asked, seemingly puzzled: "Your son works in the township and didn't participate in production yesterday. Where did your family get two work points?" Aunt Tang became a little anxious and quickly gestured towards me with her mouth, "It's her!" People looked at me and smiled. A surge of warmth suddenly passed through my whole body, and my heart felt warm all over.

    The threshing ground was busy with threshing soybean stalks, and a six-toothed rake was needed. Having just come down, I was too busy to buy this tool, so I had to borrow it from my landlady, Aunt Tang. After using it, I politely thanked her. She seemed a little unhappy and took my hand, saying, "We are mother and daughter, we are family. Take whatever you need, don't be so distant. Besides, you have come down to build a new socialist countryside with us. With the same goal, why talk about this and that, you and me!"

    Aunt Tang was busy carrying grass to feed the cattle, and asked me to cook breakfast.

    The water in the rice pot was about to boil over. Should I pour the rice into the pot? Should I pour it in with the water the rice was soaking in, or should I filter the rice first? In the end, I took it upon myself to pour the rice in along with the soaking water. Just then, Aunt Tang walked into the kitchen, and as soon as she saw the situation, she said, "You are so clumsy." My face felt a little hot. But this straightforward, unfeigned remark from a mother to her daughter made me cry out in my heart: "Sincere feelings, Mother!" Aunt Tang turned to smile at me, and I smiled back at her.

    The night was deep. I felt feverish and had a stomach ache, tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. I endured the pain. Sometimes, I would unconsciously groan. Suddenly, I realized someone was sitting by my bed. She was stroking my head with her hand, repeatedly asking: Does it hurt here? Then she used her hand to rub my stomach. My eyes became a little moist. But this was definitely not tears for the pain, because at that time I no longer felt any physical discomfort. The tears in my eyes were tears of happiness.

    “我娘俩……”
    云南晋宁化乐一社   安吉玉
    屋子里挤满了人，大伙儿都来借着休息时间评工分。陈大妈、何大婶……接二连三地刚报完了各人的工作量，屋角里传来了我的房东唐大妈的声音：“还有我娘俩的呢……。”人们都转过头来望着她。有人解不开似的发问：“你儿子在乡上工作，昨天没参加生产，你家哪里出了两个工？”唐大妈有些急，忙向我这边?了下嘴“罗，这不是！”人们看着我笑了。我的全身忽然通过一股热流，心老是热呼呼的。
    场上忙着辗豆糠，需要六齿耙。刚下来，一时还忙不及买这件工具，我只有去向房东唐大妈借。用后客气地谢了谢她。她有些不高兴的样子拉着我的手说：“我们是娘俩，是一家人，要用什么就拿什么，不要分彼此。何况你们下来就是给我们一起建设社会主义新农村。目标一样还说什么这呀、那呀、你呀、我呀！”
    大妈忙着抱草喂牛，要我煮煮早饭。
    米锅里的水快要涨了，是不是该倒米下锅？是连着泡米的水一齐倒下去呢，还是把米过滤后再倒下锅呢？最后我自做主张地连泡米水一齐倒下锅。这时唐大妈刚走进厨房，一眼看见这情况就说：“你真笨。”我脸上有些火辣辣地。但这句母亲对女儿直率、没有一点虚伪的话，使我心里喊出来了：“真诚的情感呀，妈妈。”唐大妈转过头来对我笑笑，我也对她笑笑。
    夜深了。感到发烧、肚子疼，翻去复来的在床上不能入眠。我忍着病痛。有时，却不自觉的呻吟两声。忽然我发觉我床边坐着一个人，她用手抚摸着我的头，嘴里不住的问：是这里疼吗？然后又用手给我揉肚子。我的眼眶有些润湿。但这决不是为了病疼而流泪，因为那时我已经一点也不感到身体不适。眼内噙着的却是幸福的泪水呀。
