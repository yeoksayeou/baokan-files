    Large Iron Ore Deposit Discovered in Yunnan

    Fuyuan Coal Mine's Prospective Reserves Reach 2.2 Billion Tons

    According to Yunnan Daily news: The Non-Ferrous Metals Team of the Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Geology recently discovered a large sedimentary iron ore deposit in the Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture.

    The ore deposit is widely distributed, extending from Fumin in the south to the Jinsha River bank in the north. In the Yuzidian area, at the intersection of Wuding, Luoci, Fumin, and Luquan counties alone, the exposed ore layers stretch for dozens of kilometers. The thickest ore layer is over six meters thick, with an average thickness of about two meters. The iron content of the ore is as high as 30% to 50%, with few harmful components, making it a medium-rich ore. The prospective reserves of the deposit are over 100 million tons, making it the largest sedimentary iron ore deposit discovered in our province to date.

    This industrially valuable ore deposit provides a reliable resource for the expansion of the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant and the construction of new iron and steel enterprises in the Chuxiong Autonomous Prefecture.

    According to Yunnan Daily news: The large coalfield in the Enhong area in southern Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, has been verified to have prospective reserves of 2.24 billion tons available for mining.

    This coalfield extends 45 kilometers from north to south and is 15 kilometers wide from east to west, covering an area of approximately 700 square kilometers. It contains four to eleven minable coal seams, with a minable thickness of five to thirteen meters. The coal quality is very good, with low ash and sulfur content. After washing, most of it can be directly used for coking.

    The reserves of this coalfield can support the construction of 52 pairs of large and medium-sized coal mines with an annual output of 300,000 to 900,000 tons. The coal produced will not only supply the development of the metallurgical industry in Yunnan Province but can also be partially transported to other areas.

    云南发现大铁矿
    富源煤矿远景储量达二十二亿吨
    据云南日报消息　云南省地质局黑色金属队最近在楚雄自治州找到一个大沉积铁矿。
    这个矿矿层分布面积甚广，南起富民、北达金沙江畔，仅在武定、罗次、富民、禄劝等四县交界处——鱼子甸已揭露的矿层即达数十公里长，矿层最厚达六公尺以上，平均厚度约二公尺，矿石含铁量高达30％至50％，有害成分较少，系一种中富矿石；矿藏远景储量有一亿吨以上，是我省目前发现的最大沉积铁矿。
    这个具有工业价值的矿床，为昆明钢铁厂扩建和楚雄自治州新建钢铁企业提供了可靠的资源。
    据云南日报消息　云南省富源县南部恩洪一带的大煤田，已查明可以提供开采的远景储量有二十二亿四千万吨。
    这个煤田南北延长四十五公里、东西宽十五公里，含煤面积约七百平方公里，含可采煤层四至十一层，可采厚度五到十三公尺；煤质很好，灰、硫份较低，经洗选后多数可以直接炼焦。
    这个煤田的储量，可供建设年产量三十至九十万吨的大、中型煤井五十二对，它生产的煤除供给云南省发展冶金工业外，还可以部分外运。
