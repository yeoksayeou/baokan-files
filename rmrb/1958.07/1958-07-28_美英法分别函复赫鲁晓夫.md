Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: U.S. President Eisenhower wrote to Soviet Premier Khrushchev on the 25th, replying to Khrushchev's letter of the 23rd.

Due to pressure from world opinion, Eisenhower, in his letter of the 25th, had to once again express his agreement to a summit conference within the scope of the Security Council to discuss the Middle East situation.

Eisenhower stated: If this meeting is a widespread desire, the United States is willing to participate following that regular procedure. However, he pretended not to see the obvious fact that people all over the world are eagerly demanding such a meeting, saying that "it is not yet certain that such a meeting is in fact 'universally desired'."

Regarding the issue of conference participants, Eisenhower avoided directly answering the Soviet proposal that India and Arab countries should participate, and merely stated that the United States advocates resolving the matter in accordance with the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter. (Note: Article 31 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that any member of the United Nations that is not a member of the Security Council may participate in the discussion of any question brought before the Security Council if it considers that the interests of such member are specially affected, but shall have no vote.)

Regarding the agenda of the meeting, Eisenhower agreed to "limit the discussion to the problems of the Middle East." He said, "Far more is needed than considering the problems of Lebanon and Jordan, whose situations are merely isolated manifestations of much broader problems." Then, like his first reply, Eisenhower prevaricated about the U.S.-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, as if it were not the U.S. and Britain, but some other countries, that had invaded Lebanon and Jordan. He again uttered the nonsense that the "instability of peace and security" in the Middle East is "largely due to the dangerous plight of small nations" and "direct and indirect aggression against small nations." Eisenhower said in his letter: "In March 1939, the then leader of the Soviet Communist Party pointed out that the failure of non-aggressor countries – he mentioned among them Britain and France – to stop direct or indirect aggression against small countries, meant 'conniving at war and thereby turning this war into a world war.' This prediction unfortunately proved to be correct." Here, Eisenhower shamelessly disguised the U.S.-British aggressors as anti-aggressors, portraying the U.S.-British direct aggression against Lebanon and Jordan and the crime of creating war as "stopping direct and indirect aggression against small countries." In fact, world opinion universally recognizes that the direct and indirect aggression against small countries that urgently needs to be stopped is precisely the aggression of the United States and Britain in the Middle East.

He also cited a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in 1955, stating that "fomenting internal strife for the benefit of foreign interests" is "one of the most heinous crimes," in order to slander the people of Middle Eastern countries who are fighting for national independence in opposition to imperialism and its agents' rule. It is well known that those who are "fomenting internal strife for the benefit of foreign interests" are precisely Lebanese President Chamoun and Jordanian King Hussein, who, under the protection of U.S.-British forces, are at odds with the entire population, and the Iraqi Faisal dynasty, which has already been abandoned by the entire population.

Despite all this, Eisenhower could not help but accept a meeting against his will. Eisenhower proposed: "The permanent representatives of the member states of the New York United Nations Security Council should exchange views in accordance with the arrangements made by the Secretary-General to determine whether such a meeting held on the terms I have suggested would be generally acceptable. If so, they should also agree on a mutually satisfactory date." Eisenhower requested a delay in the meeting date. He said that July 28 is too early for us.

Macmillan's Reply

Xinhua News Agency, London, 27th: British Prime Minister Macmillan wrote to Soviet Premier Khrushchev on July 26th, replying to Khrushchev's letter regarding a summit conference within the scope of the United Nations Security Council.

This letter once again attempts to deny the blatant armed aggression of Britain and the United States against Jordan and Lebanon and expresses "regret" at the legitimate accusations of this aggression in Khrushchev's letter.

Macmillan stated in this letter that certain Middle Eastern issues should be discussed at a Security Council meeting in New York, in accordance with Article 28 of the United Nations Charter – which stipulates that heads of government may attend meetings. He stated that he would go to New York to attend such a meeting, if Khrushchev also goes.

The letter advocates that the necessary arrangements be made by the permanent representatives of the member states of the Security Council, and that they decide the date of the first meeting of such a meeting and which countries should be invited to participate. The letter says that this work should begin "without delay" in close consultation with the UN Secretary-General.

De Gaulle's Reply

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th: French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Louis Joxe handed French Prime Minister De Gaulle's reply to Soviet Premier Khrushchev's letter of July 23rd regarding convening a high-level meeting within the scope of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the Middle East situation to Soviet Ambassador to Paris Vinogradov on the 26th.

In his reply, De Gaulle first reiterated France's support for Khrushchev's proposal in his letter of July 19th to hold a five-nation summit conference in Geneva to discuss the Middle East issue. He then expressed his opinion on Khrushchev's suggestion in his letter of July 23rd regarding holding a high-level meeting within the scope of the Security Council. He said, "Of course, heads of government can participate in this meeting." However, the French government believes that if such a "special Security Council meeting" is held, then in addition to "the eleven member states of the council and the representatives of India and Arab countries," there should also be "representatives of Turkey, Iran, and Israel." He believes that "discussion under these circumstances will soon lead the Security Council to further increase the number of participating countries and expand the scope of discussion." De Gaulle believes that such a meeting is different from the high-level meeting that he has already agreed to participate in principle.

De Gaulle then emphasized that he believes "it is best to maintain our original plan, that is, to convene a meeting of the heads of government of the major countries concerned." He also stated that the meeting is best held in Geneva or any other city in Europe.

De Gaulle also said that even if the aforementioned special meeting within the scope of the Security Council is convened in the future, the meeting of heads of government will still have to be held sooner or later. He concluded by saying that the French government believes it should "carefully prepare" for such a meeting. He indicated that the French government will conduct "consultations" with relevant Western European countries on the Middle East issue, because "France will have to take their views into consideration when adopting an attitude on the essence of the issue."

On the same day, a French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: The French government advocates that the Security Council first authorize the heads of government of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India to hold a "limited" high-level meeting to study the Middle East crisis, then listen to the opinions of other relevant countries, and then report their decisions to the Security Council. The meeting place may be Geneva.

### 美英法分别函复赫鲁晓夫

    美英法分别函复赫鲁晓夫
    艾森豪威尔的回信
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔25日写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，答复赫鲁晓夫23日的信件。
    由于全世界舆论的压力，艾森豪威尔在他25日的信件中不得不再一次表示同意由安全理事会范围内的首脑会议来讨论中东局势。
    艾森豪威尔表示：如果这个会议是普遍希望的话，美国愿意参与遵循那正规的程序。但是他又假装不看见全世界人民迫切要求举行这个会议的显明事实，说什么“现在还不能肯定，这样一个会议在事实上是‘普遍希望’的”。
    关于会议成员问题，艾森豪威尔对苏联所建议的应当有印度和阿拉伯国家参加一节避免直接的答复，而只是说，美国主张按照联合国宪章中的有关规定解决。（按：联合国宪章第三十一条规定，在安全理事会提出的任何问题，经其认为对于非安全理事会理事国之联合国任何会员国之利益有特别关系时，该会员国得参加讨论，但无投票权。）
    关于会议的议程问题，艾森豪威尔同意“限于讨论中东的问题”。他说，“所需要的远不只是考虑黎巴嫩和约旦的问题，这两个国家的局势只不过是广泛得多的问题的孤立表现”。接着，艾森豪威尔就像他的第一次复信一样，为美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦进行狡辩，似乎侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的不是美英而是别的什么国家。他又放出所谓中东的“和平和安全的不稳定在很大程度上是由于小国被置于危险的境地”，是由于“对小国的直接和间接侵略”的谰言。艾森豪威尔在信中说：“1939年3月，当时的苏联共产党领袖指出，非侵略国家——他提到其中有英国和法国——没有能够制止对小国的直接或间接侵略，意味着‘纵容战争，因此把这场战争变成一场世界大战。’这种预测不幸证明是正确的。”在这里艾森豪威尔恬不知耻地把美英侵略者乔装为反侵略者，把美英直接侵略黎、约两国、制造战争的罪行说做是“制止对小国的直接和间接侵略”，而事实上，全世界的舆论都公认，目前急需制止的对小国的直接和间接侵略正是美国和英国在中东的侵略。
    他还援引联合国大会1955年的一项决议说，“为外国的利益而酝酿内争”是“一切罪恶中最严重的罪恶之一”，以此来诬蔑反对帝国主义及其代理人的统治而争取民族独立的中东各国人民。尽人皆知，为“外国利益而酝酿内争”的恰恰是在美英武力保护下与全国人民为敌的黎巴嫩总统夏蒙和约旦国王侯赛因，以及已经被全国人民抛弃的伊拉克费萨尔王朝。
    尽管说了这一切，艾森豪威尔还是不能不接受一次事与愿违的会议。艾森豪威尔提出：“纽约联合国安全理事会的成员国的常任代表们，应当根据秘书长所作的安排交换意见，来确定这样一种根据我所建议的条件举行的会议是否能得到普遍接受。如果是这样的话，他们还应该就一个能得到普遍满意的日期取得一致意见。”艾森豪威尔要求延迟开会的日期。他说，7月28日这个日期对我们说来是太早了。
  麦克米伦的回信
    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦7月26日写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，答复赫鲁晓夫关于在联合国安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议的信件。
    这封信再次企图抵赖英国和美国明目张胆地武装侵略约旦和黎巴嫩的行动，并且对赫鲁晓夫信件中对这一侵略行动的正当指责表示“遗憾”。
    麦克米伦在这封信里表示：某些中东问题应当根据联合国宪章第二十八条的规定——规定政府首脑可以出席会议——在纽约的安全理事会会议上加以讨论。他表示，他将前往纽约出席这种会议，如果赫鲁晓夫也去的话。
    这封信主张由安全理事会成员国的常任代表进行必要的安排，而且由他们来决定这种会议的第一次会议的日期和应该邀请哪些国家参加。信件说，这一工作应该在同联合国秘书长密切磋商的情况下“毫不迟延地”开始进行。
  戴高乐的回信
    新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部秘书长路易·若克斯26日把法国总理戴高乐对苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日关于在联合国安全理事会范围内召开讨论中东局势问题的最高级会议的信件的答复交给了苏联驻巴黎大使维诺格拉多夫。
    戴高乐在复信中首先重申法国赞成赫鲁晓夫7月19日信中所提出的关于在日内瓦召开五国政府首脑会议讨论中东问题的建议。他接着对赫鲁晓夫7月23日的信里关于在安全理事会范围内举行最高级会议的建议表示了意见。他说，“当然，各国政府首脑可以参加这个会议。”但是，法国政府认为，如果举行这样一次“安全理事会特别会议”，那么参加会议的除了“十一个理事国以及印度和阿拉伯国家的代表”之外，还应该有“土耳其、伊朗和以色列三国的代表参加”。他认为，“在这种情况下进行讨论，不久就将使安全理事会进一步增加与会国和扩大讨论的范围。”戴高乐认为，这样一个会议同他已经在原则上同意参加的最高级会议是不同的。
    戴高乐接着强调说，他认为“最好还是保持我们最初的计划，就是说，召开各主要有关国家政府首脑的会议”。他并且表示，会议最好在日内瓦或在欧洲任何其他城市里举行。
    戴高乐还说，即使将来召开了上述安全理事会范围内的特别会议，各国政府首脑的会议也仍然迟早要举行。他最后说，法国政府认为它应该为这样一次会议“仔细进行筹备”。他表明，法国政府将同西欧各有关国家就中东问题进行“磋商”，因为“法国就问题的本质采取态度时，将不能不考虑到它们的看法”。
    同一天，法国外交部发言人说：法国政府主张首先由安全理事会授权英、法、美、苏和印度五国政府首脑举行一次“有限制的”最高级会议来研究中东危机问题，然后再听取其他有关国家的意见，随后再向安全理事会报告他们的决定。会议地点也许可以选择日内瓦。
