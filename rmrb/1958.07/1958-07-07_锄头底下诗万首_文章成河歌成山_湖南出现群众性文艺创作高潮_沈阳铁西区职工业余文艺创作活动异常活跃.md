    "Ten Thousand Poems Under the Hoe, Essays Form Rivers, Songs Become Mountains"
    Mass Literary Creation Upsurge in Hunan
    Amateur Literary Creation Activities of Workers in Tiexi District, Shenyang Exceptionally Active
    This newspaper reports that with the arrival of the production upsurge, an unprecedented mass literary creation upsurge has emerged in Hunan Province. By early May, the number of organized amateur literary creation groups for workers and peasants throughout the province had grown to more than 40,000, with a writing force of 600,000 to 700,000 people, creating more than one million works of various kinds.
    The characteristics of this mass literary creation upsurge are: a large writing force, fast creation, many varieties, wide dissemination, and the masses themselves composing, singing, and performing, closely supporting and cooperating with the production leap forward and various central tasks. Farmers in Hengshan County used folk songs to sing about the prosperity of literary creation in the county, saying: "Hengshan is covered with flowers, all flowers planted by farmers, ten thousand poems under the hoe, essays form rivers, songs become mountains, the more we sing mountain songs, the more energetic we become, singing of a thousand years of happiness." Because the county adopted various measures to vigorously encourage mass creation, the number of creation groups above the agricultural cooperative level in the county has grown to 1,021, with a writing force of more than 10,000 people. From January to April alone, more than 11,800 relatively excellent works were selected by the county cultural center. The 130 peasant authors in Xintang Township of the county have all learned to record the work and thoughts of the commune members in their notebooks at any time during labor, and to compile them into mountain songs, clapper talks, doggerel, etc., for field mobilization, praising the advanced and criticizing the backward. The county's clubs have mobilized the masses to use various literary and artistic forms for propaganda in road construction, fertilizer accumulation, elimination of the four pests, and literacy campaigns.
    Many enthusiastic amateur authors have also emerged in the province's creation movement. Yu Xiaochu, a fitter in the processing workshop of the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory, had created more than 480 works by early May. Liu Yong, a peasant author in Xiangxiang County, wrote more than 700 plays, novels, essays, communications, and mountain songs last year, totaling 120,000 words. By May of this year, he had created more than 600 more works. Plays such as "Common Ascent" and "Happy Event" written by Liu Yong, "Zhangjiang Ferry" and "Stirring Up Wind and Waves" written by Su Chunting, another peasant author in Xiangyin County, and "A Chicken" written by Gu Yangchu, a peasant author in Changde County, have all been performed in many troupes and have been warmly welcomed by the masses.
    In order to promote greater development of this literary and artistic creation activity, most counties (cities) in Hunan Province have now established literary and artistic creation committees, and creation guidance groups have been established in various grassroots organizations, with county cultural centers as the core, forming a province-wide amateur literary and artistic creation guidance network. Through tens of thousands of clubs, troupes, singing teams, as well as blackboards, big-character posters, wall newspapers, and mimeographed newspapers, a vast creation garden has been opened up, promoting the great prosperity of creation. (Kuang Luan)
    This newspaper reports that the amateur literary and artistic creation of workers in the Tiexi Industrial District of Shenyang City has formed a mass activity.
    In less than a month, 95 factories in the district have established a new literary and artistic creation team with more than 2,600 workers participating.
    The amateur literary and artistic creation of workers in this district began as early as 1952. At that time, due to superstitious ideas about literary and artistic creation, emphasizing that one must have a certain level of education and writing ability to engage in creation, only attention was paid to improvement while neglecting popularization in the work. The seven research offices that had been established for creation, comics, and drama only cultivated and guided about 100 amateur authors in recent years, relaxing the guidance for the amateur literary and artistic creation of the vast number of workers. The Tiexi District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shenyang City organized the cultural section of the district people's committee and the staff of the cultural center, and through inspection and great debate, changed the passive practice of limiting the amateur literary and artistic creation of workers to the activities of a few people in the past.
    In order to promote the great development of amateur literary and artistic creation by workers, the Tiexi District Committee proposed that the whole party should participate in the amateur literary and artistic creation of workers. By the end of June, according to incomplete statistics, among the 173 factories under the leadership of the district committee, 95 factories such as the Shenyang Bridge Factory, the General Machinery Factory, and the Power Machinery Factory had established 332 amateur literary and artistic creation groups, with a literary and artistic creation force of more than 2,600 workers.
    Under the personal leadership of the party branch secretary, the amateur literary and artistic creation group of each workshop closely combines with the current central work and production, driving and attracting all the workers in the workshop to engage in creation. According to the statistics of 78 factories in this district, more than 21,800 literary and artistic works of various forms are to be created this year, and 178 amateur authors are to be cultivated to reach the level of amateur writers within five years.
    At present, the vast number of workers in this district are closely combining in-depth propaganda of the general line, carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution, and setting off a wave of amateur literary and artistic creation.
    Workers in the Tiexi District of Shenyang City have also run their own art magazine, "Singing the General Line," which was launched on June 23. (Yao Guilan, Wang Dianxue)

    “锄头底下诗万首　文章成河歌成山”
    湖南出现群众性文艺创作高潮
    沈阳铁西区职工业余文艺创作活动异常活跃
    本报讯　随着生产高潮的来到，目前湖南全省出现了一个空前繁荣的群众性的文艺创作高潮。到5月上旬，全省各地有组织的工农业余创作小组已经发展到四万多个，作者队伍达到六、七十万名，共创作各种作品一百多万篇。
    这个群众性的文艺创作高潮的特点是作者队伍大、创作快、品种多、传播广、群众自编自唱自演，紧密地支持与配合了生产跃进和各项中心工作。衡山县农民用山歌歌唱了这个县文艺创作的繁荣景象，他们说：“衡山遍地鲜花开，鲜花都是农民栽，锄头底下诗万首，文章成河歌成山，山歌越唱越有劲，唱起千年幸福来。”这个县由于采取了各种措施，大力鼓励群众创作，全县农业社以上的创作小组已发展到一千零二十一个，作者队伍达到一万多人，今年仅1到4月份经县文化馆评选出来比较优秀的作品就达到一万一千八百多件。这个县的新塘乡一百三十个农民作者，都学会了在劳动中随时把社员们的劳动情况和思想情况记录在自己的小本子里，随时编写成山歌、快板、顺口溜等进行田间鼓动，表扬先进，批评落后。全县的俱乐部在修公路、积肥、除四害、扫盲等运动中都发动群众用各种文艺形式进行宣传。
    全省在创作运动中还出现了许多热心写作的业余作者，省农业机械厂加工车间钳工余晓初，到5月上旬为止，已创作作品四百八十多篇。湘乡县农民作者刘勇去年一年内写作剧本、小说、散文、通讯、山歌等七百多件，共十二万字。今年到5月止，又创作作品六百多篇。像刘勇写的“共同上升”、“喜事”、“张江渡口”和湘阴县另一个农民作者苏春庭写的“兴风作浪”、常德县农民作者顾阳初写的“一只鸡”等剧本，都曾经在很多剧团上演，受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    为了促使这一文艺创作活动的更大发展，现在湖南省绝大部分县（市）已经成立了文艺创作委员会，在各基层组织成立了创作辅导组，以各县文化馆为核心，组成了全省的业余文艺创作辅导网。通过数以万计的俱乐部、剧团、歌咏队以及黑板报、大字报、墙报、油印报等开辟了广大的创作园地，促进了创作的大繁荣。　（邝麓安）
    本报讯　沈阳市铁西工业区职工业余文艺创作，已经形成群众性活动。
    这个区已经有九十五个工厂在不到一个月的时间里，建立起一支拥有二千六百多名职工参加的新型文艺创作队伍。
    这个区的职工业余文艺创作，早在1952年就开展了业余文艺创作活动。当时由于对文艺创作有迷信思想，强调要有一定文化水平和写作能力才能搞创作，所以在工作中只注意提高忽视普及，已建立的创作、漫画、戏剧等七个研究室，几年来只培养和辅导一百来名业余作者，放松了对广大职工业余文艺创作的辅导。中共沈阳市铁西区委，组织区人民委员会文化科和文化馆工作人员，通过检查和大辩论，改变了过去把职工业余文艺创作局限为少数人活动的消极作法。
    为促进职工业余文艺创作大发展，铁西区委提出全党动手开展职工业余文艺创作的要求。到6月底止，据不完全统计，在区委领导的一百七十三个工厂里，已经有沈阳桥梁厂、通用机器厂、动力机械厂等九十五个工厂，建立起三百三十二个业余文艺创作小组，拥有二千六百多名职工的文艺创作队伍。
    每个车间的业余文艺创作小组，在党支部书记亲自领导下，紧紧结合当前中心工作和生产，带动和吸引全车间职工人人搞创作。据这个区的七十八个工厂的统计，要在今年创作二万一千八百多篇各种形式的文艺作品，五年内培养出一百七十八名业余作者达到业余作家水平。
    目前这个区的广大职工，正在紧紧结合深入宣传总路线、开展技术革命和文化革命，掀起业余文艺创作热潮。
    沈阳市铁西区工人还办了自己的艺术刊物“歌唱总路线”，这个刊物已经在6月23日创刊。　（姚桂兰、王殿学）
