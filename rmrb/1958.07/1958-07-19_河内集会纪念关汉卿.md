Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th: Hundreds of Vietnamese literary and art workers, representatives of Vietnamese people's organizations and people from all walks of life, as well as cultural counselors and specialists from fraternal countries' embassies in Vietnam, gathered at the Hanoi Grand Theater on the evening of the 17th to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the literary activities of Guan Hanqing, the great Chinese playwright.

Nguyen Xuan Tham, Deputy Secretary-General of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, pointed out the anti-feudal nature of Guan Hanqing's works in his opening speech.

Nguyen Xuan Tham said that the Vietnamese people must strive to learn from Guan Hanqing's ideas and his art in order to better develop their own drama and art endeavors.

Nguyen Xuan Tham said: Just as we are commemorating Guan Hanqing, the Iraqi people have achieved a great victory, while the American imperialists are frantically carrying out armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon. We express infinite anger at this behavior of the imperialists. He said: We believe that the power of the people of the world and the forces of peace will surely achieve final victory.
