Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 5th: The annual "Baltic Sea Peace Week" grandly opened on the afternoon of the 5th in the Democratic German port of Rostock.

This great gathering for peace among the peoples of the Baltic Sea region is being held under the slogan "The Baltic Sea should become a region of peace and friendship for all peoples." An estimated 80,000 people will participate in Peace Week, including representatives from the two Germanys, the Soviet Union, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. Among them will be politicians, trade union workers, athletes, scientists, artists, and representatives of women and youth.

To celebrate the opening of Peace Week, Rostock residents held a mass rally in Thälmann Square, decorated with the flags of the Baltic Sea countries. Attending the rally were Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, representatives of the government, party, and democratic organizations of the German Democratic Republic, the working people of the Rostock region, and representatives from various countries.

Ulbricht delivered a speech at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to guests from neighboring countries. He said that at a time when West German militarists and their American accomplices are jointly creating new war conspiracies, it is of great significance for representatives of the Baltic Sea countries to hold a peaceful and friendly gathering. The people of these countries should play a decisive role in making the Baltic Sea a sea of peace.

Ulbricht called on the people of all countries to do everything possible to thwart plans to turn the Baltic Sea into a base for aggression by the North Atlantic bloc. He pointed out that the decisive step in guaranteeing peace in the Baltic Sea is to conclude a non-aggression pact between the Baltic Sea countries. This pact could include members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, neutral countries, and members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. Ulbricht also pointed out the importance of the European nuclear-weapon-free zone proposed by the Polish government to all Baltic Sea countries.

On the evening of the 5th, amateur art troupes from Democratic German enterprises and foreign guests performed many programs in Rostock's Youth Square.

During the friendly meeting in the coming week, there will be meetings of dock and shipbuilding workers, conferences of women's peace representatives, various forums, youth camping, art performances, and sports meets.

    使波罗的海成为和平的海洋
    “波罗的海和平周”隆重开幕
    乌布利希呼吁沿海各国缔结互不侵犯公约
    新华社柏林5日电　一年一度的“波罗的海和平周”5日下午在民主德国的海港罗斯托克隆重开幕。
    这个波罗的海地区各国人民的和平大聚会是在“波罗的海应该成为各国人民和平友好的地区”的口号下举行的。参加和平周的预计将有八万人，他们是来自两个德国、苏联、波兰、芬兰、瑞典、挪威、丹麦和冰岛等国的代表，其中包括政治家、工会工作者、运动员、科学家、艺术家、妇女和青年的代表。
    为了庆祝和平周开幕，罗斯托克居民在装饰着波罗的海各国国旗的台尔曼广场举行了群众大会。参加大会的有德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希、德意志民主共和国政府、党和民主组织的代表、罗斯托克区的劳动人民以及各国代表。
    乌布利希在会上发表演说，向各邻国的客人表示热烈的欢迎。他说，正当西德的军国主义者和他们的美国同谋者共同制造新的战争阴谋的时候，波罗的海各国的代表们举行一次和平友好的聚会有很重要的意义，这些国家的人民应该起决定性的作用，使波罗的海成为和平的海洋。
    乌布利希号召各国人民全力粉碎把波罗的海变为北大西洋集团进行侵略的基地的计划。他指出，保障波罗的海和平的决定性步骤是缔结一个波罗的海各国互不侵犯公约，这个公约可以包括北大西洋公约组织成员国、中立国家和华沙条约成员国在内。乌布利希还指出了波兰政府建议建立的欧洲无原子武器区对所有波罗的海各国的重要意义。
    5日晚上，民主德国各企业的业余文艺团体和外国客人在罗斯托克的青年广场演出了许多节目。
    在以后一个星期的友好会见期间将举行码头和造船工人会议，妇女和平代表会议，各种座谈会、青年露营、艺术表演和运动会。
