Black war clouds shroud the Middle East, the Mediterranean roars! Oil burns in raging fires, coconut trees howl in the blaze. American soldiers, with gleaming bayonets, press close to the breast of the Arab mother, whose eyes are filled with sorrow and anger, as if calling out: "Righteous Chinese brothers, help us!"

My heart is ablaze with anger. Warhorses rear and neigh to the sky; the gun in my hand burns!

We once fought, one bloody footprint at a time, across the vast land of our motherland, driving the American devils and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek out of the mainland—we were victorious!

We once fought in snowstorms in Korea, eating fried noodles and snow, driving the American devils and their running dog Syngman Rhee back south of the 38th parallel—we were victorious!

MacArthur, Truman, Eisenhower, Dulles. And all their weapons and equipment, even rockets and atomic bombs, what are they worth? We know!

Now, these war maniacs have stretched out their blood-soaked hands again, wanting to strangle the throats of peaceful people.

American warships have raised their gun muzzles, peering at every peaceful coast in the world; American planes have hung bombs, ready to drop them….

In Korea, how much blood and tears did we see! "U.S.A." bombs falling, falling! Golden rice fields burned, houses collapsed, children stretched out their little hands, crying: "Mama, Mama!"… When we think of these things, our hearts clench tightly! … Can we allow such a scene to reappear? Can we stand by and watch the "U.S.A." bayonet thrust into the chest of the Arab people? No, a thousand times no!

Comrades, I, as a righteous warrior, a defender of peace, as long as I live, I will fight imperialism every day!

Comrades, the drums of war are already sounding in the Middle East. I have decided to put my gun beside my pillow. If at dawn or dusk, the people issue a call to battle, I will embark on the journey, to fight for the defense of peace, and deliver a fatal blow to the savage aggressors!

    我的心燃起了怒火
    李虹
    黑糊糊的战云笼罩着中东，地中海咆哮起来！石油在烈火中燃烧，椰子树在烈火中呼啸。美国兵端着明晃晃的刺刀，逼近了阿拉伯母亲的胸膛，阿拉伯母亲的眼里充满悲愤，仿佛在呼叫：“正义的中国弟兄，帮助我们！”
    我的心燃起了怒火。战马仰天嘶叫；枪在手里发热了！
    我们曾经在祖国的辽阔的土地上，一步一个血印地厮杀过，把美国鬼子连同它的走狗蒋介石赶出大陆——我们胜利了！
    我们曾经在漫天风雪的朝鲜，一口炒面一口雪地战斗过，把美国鬼子连同它的走狗李承晚赶回三八线以南——我们胜利了！
    麦克阿瑟、杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯。再加上它们那些全套的武器装备，那怕是火箭、原子弹也好，到底能值几个钱？我们知道！
    现在，这些战争疯子们，又伸出了血淋淋的双手，要扼住和平人民的咽喉。
    美国的军舰都仰起了炮口，向全世界上各个和平海岸窥视；美国的飞机都挂上了炸弹，准备投掷……。
    在朝鲜，我们见到了多少血和泪呵！“U·S·A”炸弹落下来，落下来！金黄的稻田燃烧了，房子倒塌了，孩子们伸着两只小手哭喊着：“妈妈，妈妈呀！”……我们一想这些，心就紧紧收缩！……难道我们容许这样的情景重现吗？难道我们能眼看着“U·S·A”刺刀插进阿拉伯人民的胸膛吗？不能，一万个不能！
    同志们，我，作为正义的战士，和平的保卫者，只要活一天，就要和帝国主义战斗一天！
    同志们，战鼓已经在中东敲响，我决定把枪放在枕头旁边，如果在一天的拂晓或黄昏，人民发出战斗的号召，我就要跨上征途，为保卫和平而战斗，给野蛮的侵略者致命的一击！
