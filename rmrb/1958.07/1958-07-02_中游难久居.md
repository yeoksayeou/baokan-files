    It's Hard to Stay Long in the Middle Stream
    Lin Zhong
    In the old society, "coercion" could be seen everywhere: landlords forcing rent, creditors forcing debt repayment, officials forcing taxes... ultimately forcing people to join the Liangshan rebels. In the new society, this kind of coercion is gone. However, since the upsurge of agricultural production and construction, some ideologically right-leaning and conservative people often feel a new kind of "coercion," called "the situation forces people," and often feel that some things are forcing them to be uneasy. Originally, a plan to increase production by 10% was considered not very safe (what to do in case of natural disasters? etc.); but neighboring areas have set plans to increase production by several tens of percent or even more than double. This forces them to revise their plans. They felt it was very difficult to build one mu of irrigated land per person in their own area, while neighboring areas built two or three mu per person. This forces them not only not to relax, but also not to proceed at the same speed, but to speed up. It doesn't matter if advanced units run ahead, what's frightening is that the backward units of the past are now also running ahead one after another. It is really awkward and embarrassing to be left behind alone.
    Therefore, since last winter, in addition to often hearing some people sighing "the situation forces people," we have also constantly heard some people "willing to stay in the middle stream" and wanting to "permanently stay in the middle stream."
    The situation forces people, this is a fact. Not only are advanced areas forcing backward areas, backward areas forcing non-advancing areas, fast horses forcing slow horses, and back waves forcing front waves, but also, the leap forward in agriculture is also forcing industry, transportation, and even cultural, educational, and health undertakings to also leap forward. Farmers are forcing workers, rural areas are forcing cities, food is forcing machines, machines are forcing steel, and steel is forcing machines again (requiring metallurgical equipment). According to dialectics, things are not isolated, but interconnected. The development of one thing will inevitably lead to the development of other things. And the development of one thing is usually conditional on the development of other things. People living in this world moving according to the laws of dialectics cannot but either force others or be forced by others. It is impossible to want to not disturb each other and have peace and quiet.
    Similarly, it is also impossible to want to permanently settle in the middle stream. It is either progress or backwardness. Even when it seems to be in the middle stream for the time being, it is not absolute: it is either leaning towards the advanced or leaning towards the backward. As a result of continuous movement and development, this bias will become more and more distinct.
    If people want to control their own destiny, want to live actively, happily and clearly, then they should carefully study and grasp the objectively existing laws of the movement of things, and according to these laws, muster up their energy, strive for the upstream, establish advanced banners, attract and promote everyone to move forward, which can also be said to be forcing others to move forward. In this way, they will make more contributions to the cause.
    Countless facts since last winter have proven that any backward unit, under any unfavorable conditions, can move forward at a high speed, change objective conditions, and also change its own backward status. Not to mention units in an intermediate state. The key to the decision is to liberate the mind, dare to think and dare to act. Of course, there is also a condition that is not a condition, that is, to be willing to think and willing to do (not just wanting to sleep). And this depends on revolutionary enthusiasm. Therefore, anyone who always wants to settle in the middle stream, does not like others forcing them to move forward, and does not want to force others to move forward, then they should check whether their revolutionary enthusiasm has declined. This is the fundamental problem.

    中游难久居
    林中
    旧社会里到处可以看到“逼”：地主逼租，债主逼债，官府逼税……最后是逼上梁山。在新社会里，这样的逼是没有了。但是农业生产建设高潮出现以来，一些思想右倾保守的人却时常感觉到一种新的“逼”，叫做“形势逼人”，经常感觉到有一些事情逼得自己不能安生。原来做了一个增产一成的计划，就觉得不很保险（遇到自然灾害怎么办呢？等等）；邻近地方却订了增产好几成以至增产一倍以上的计划。这就逼得自己不能不重新修订计划。自己地区每人修一亩水浇地，就觉得很吃力了，而邻区却每人修了二、三亩。这就逼得自己不但不能松一口气，而且不能照旧速度走，而要加快速度走。先进单位跑前去了，这还不要紧，可怕的是过去落后的单位现在也纷纷跑前去了。自己孤零零地甩在后面，实在尴尬，难堪。
    所以，去年冬季以来除了时常听到一些人叹息“形势逼人”以外，还不断听到有些人“甘居中游”，想“永居中游”。
    形势逼人，这是事实。不但是先进地区逼落后地区，后进地区逼不进地区，快马逼慢马，后浪逼前浪，而且，农业的飞跃前进还逼着工业、交通运输业以至文化教育卫生等各方面事业也必须飞跃前进。农民逼工人，农村逼城市，粮食逼机器，机器逼钢铁，钢铁又逼机器（要冶金设备）。按照辩证法，事物不是孤立的，而是互相联系着的。某一事物发展了，必然要引起另一些事物的发展。而某一事物的发展，又通常以另一些事物的发展为条件。人们生活在这个按照辩证法规律运动着的世界上，就不能不或者是逼别人，或者是受别人逼。想要互不打扰，平安无事，是不可能的。
    同样，要想永远地安居中游，也是不可能的。或者是前进，或者是落后。就在暂时看来是处于中游的时候，其实也并不绝对：或者是偏向先进，或者是偏向落后。不断地运动和发展的结果，这种偏向会越来越鲜明。
    人们如果想要掌握自己的命运，要想生活得主动、愉快而清醒，那就应当好好地研究和掌握这种客观存在着的事物运动的规律，根据这种规律，鼓足干劲，力争上游，树立先进旗帜，吸引和推动大家前进，也可以说是逼着别人前进。这样，自己就对事业做了更多的贡献。
    去冬以来的无数事实证明，任何落后的单位，处在任何不利的条件之下，都可以高速度地前进，改变客观条件，同时也改变自己的落后地位。更不用说处在中间状态的单位了。决定的关键，是要解放思想，敢想敢干。当然，这里还有一个不算条件的条件，那就是愿想愿干（不是光想睡觉）。而这又取决于革命热情。所以，谁要是老想安居中游，不喜欢人家逼自己前进，也不想去逼别人前进，那他就应当检查一下自己是否革命热情衰退了。这是根本问题。
