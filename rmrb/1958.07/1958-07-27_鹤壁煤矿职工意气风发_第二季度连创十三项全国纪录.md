Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 25th: The spirited and high-spirited workers of the Hebi Coal Mine have continuously set thirteen new national records in the second quarter, setting an example for the overall Great Leap Forward of China's coal industry.

These thirteen new national records cover every important link from geological exploration and mine infrastructure construction to coal mining production. In terms of geological exploration, the "May Fourth" Youth Drill of the Zhongnan 127 Exploration Team created a new record of advancing 148.2 meters per day on May 27th; the monthly platform efficiency in May reached 1,757.6 meters, which is 800% of the national plan. The "May Fourth" Youth Topographic Survey Team of this exploration team, on May 2nd, under the difficult conditions of Class III areas and Level 4 wind and sand, measured a 1:5000 topographic map, creating a new national record of 2.25 square kilometers of daily efficiency for one instrument, which is nine times higher than the national standard. On June 28th, they created another miracle of 10.4 square kilometers of daily efficiency in the same area, which is sixty-five times higher than the national quota. Due to the above achievements, the 127 Exploration Team completed the geological detailed investigation report for the construction of a 900,000-ton mine in the Luqi area nine months ahead of schedule, providing a guarantee for the early start of construction of this pair of mines.

In terms of mine infrastructure construction, the workers of the No. 2 Civil Engineering Zone built the Hebi main shaft building, which is 27.15 meters high and 557 square meters in area, in 25 days, which is two days less than the time spent by the workers of the Fengfeng Mine, who previously created a national record, but the amount of work is almost twice as large. The workers of the No. 3 Civil Engineering Zone built a coal storage bin of Hebi No. 3 Mine with a capacity of 1,400 tons, equivalent to a seven-story building, in 73 days, which is 77 days less than the construction period of the Huainan Xiejiacang coal storage bin. The installation workers also created a new record of completing the installation of a main headframe and a three-meter winch in eleven days. The emergence of these new records has greatly accelerated the speed of mine construction. According to the previous construction methods, it would take three years to build a pair of modern mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal, but now it can be built in one and a half years.

In terms of coal mining production, the Youth Rapid Excavation Team of Hebi No. 1 Mine created two new records in June: 150 meters of monthly excavation in stone roadways and 500 meters of monthly excavation in coal roadways. Because of this achievement, Hebi No. 1 Mine, which was newly put into production, reached its designed production capacity ahead of schedule, and its annual coal output this year increased from the original design of 450,000 tons to 600,000 tons.

    鹤壁煤矿职工意气风发
    第二季度连创十三项全国纪录
    据新华社郑州25日电　斗志昂扬、意气风发的鹤壁煤矿的工人们，在第二季度连续创造了十三项全国新纪录，为我国煤炭工业的全面大跃进作出了榜样。
    这十三项全国新纪录，从地质勘探、矿井基本建设到采煤生产，每个重要环节都有。在地质勘探方面，中南一二七勘探队“五四”青年号钻机，在5月27日创造日进一百四十八点二公尺的新纪录；5月份月台效率达到一千七百五十七点六公尺，为国家计划的800％。这个勘探队的“五四”青年地形测量小组，5月2日在三类地区、四级风砂的困难条件下，测量一比五千地形图，创造了一台仪器日效二点二五平方公里的全国新纪录，比国家规定的效率提高九倍。6月28日，他们在同样地区又创造了日效率十点四平方公里的奇迹，比国家定额提高六十五倍。由于以上的成绩，一二七勘探队提前九个月完成了国家在鹿淇区建设年产九十万吨矿井的地质精查报告，为这对矿井提前开工建设提供了保证。
    在矿井基本建设方面，土建二工区的职工，用二十五天建成高二十七点一五公尺、面积五百五十七平方公尺的鹤壁主井楼，比在先创造全国纪录的峰峰矿职工建设一个主井楼少用二天，工程量却将近大一倍。土建三工区的职工，用七十三天建成一座相当于七层楼房高、容煤一千四百吨的鹤壁三矿储煤仓，比淮南谢家集矿储煤仓建设日期少用七十七天。安装工人还创造了十一天安装完毕一个主井架和三公尺绞车的新纪录。这些新纪录的出现，大大加快了矿井建设的速度。按照过去的施工方法，建设一对年产六十万吨煤炭的现代化矿井，需要三年才能建成，现在缩短到一年半就可以建成。
    在采煤生产方面，鹤壁一矿的青年快速掘进班，在6月份创造了石巷道月掘进一百五十公尺和煤巷道月掘进五百公尺的两项新纪录。由于这个成绩，使新投入生产的鹤壁一矿提前达到设计生产能力，今年由原设计年产煤炭四十五万吨提高到年产六十万吨。
