Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch: The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company recently successfully rolled out China's first batch of copper-containing heavy steel rails and high-silicon heavy steel rails, making new contributions to China's iron and steel industry and transportation sector. Trial rolling of these two types of steel rails is one of the important contents of China's scientific and technological research projects this year.

The greatest advantage of copper-containing steel rails is their strong corrosion resistance, making them less susceptible to corrosion from rainwater and moisture. In many railway line areas in China with particularly heavy rainfall and numerous tunnels, ordinary steel rails cannot withstand the corrosion of rain and moisture for long, and often need to be replaced every two or three years. The use of copper-containing steel rails can greatly improve the service life of railways and reduce the cost of replacing steel rails.

In railway line areas with many curves and steep slopes, steel rails are subjected to particularly high pressure and friction. In these areas, the use of ordinary steel rails, due to insufficient wear resistance and strength, easily leads to damage and frequent replacement of the steel rails. The characteristic of high-silicon steel rails is that they are particularly wear-resistant and pressure-resistant. The use of high-silicon steel rails in areas with many curves and steep slopes can significantly improve the service life of railways.

The copper-containing steel rails and high-silicon steel rails were successfully trial-produced by the workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company in close collaboration with engineers from the Iron and Steel Research Institute and the Railway Science Research Institute. In the absence of technical data, the workers boldly experimented and conducted numerous tests and studies, quickly smelting completely qualified copper-containing steel and high-silicon steel, and rolling them into new steel rails.

    重庆制出两种新钢轨
    新华社重庆电重庆钢铁公司最近轧制成功我国第一批含铜重型钢轨和高矽重型钢轨，对我国钢铁工业和交通事业作出了新贡献。试轧这两种钢轨，是今年我国科学技术研究项目中的重要内容之一。
    含铜钢轨的最大优点是耐腐蚀性很强，不容易为雨水和潮气腐蚀。在我国不少雨水特多和隧道多的铁路线地区，铺设一般钢轨不能久经雨和潮水腐蚀，往往隔两三年就要换铺一次钢轨；铺设含铜钢轨后，就能大大提高铁路的使用寿命和减少换铺钢轨的费用。
    在弯多、坡大的铁路线地区，钢轨承受压力和磨擦力特别大。在这些地区铺设一般钢轨，由于耐磨能力和强度不够，钢轨就容易损坏，也常常要更换。高矽钢轨的特点就在于特别耐磨，耐压，在弯多、坡大的地区铺设高矽钢轨，就能显著提高铁路的使用年限。
    含铜钢轨和高矽钢轨，是重庆钢铁公司职工在钢铁研究院、铁道科学研究院工程师们的紧密协作下试制成功的。在没有技术资料的情况下，职工们进行大胆尝试，多次试验研究，很快炼出了完全合格的含铜钢和高矽钢，并轧制成新钢轨。
