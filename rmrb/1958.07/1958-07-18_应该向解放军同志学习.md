    Should Learn From the People's Liberation Army Comrades
    On May 11th, the Beijing Automobile Company sent five automobile drivers with five trucks to help our county transport sweet potato seedlings for seven days. The county leaders were very grateful for their support. Before they arrived, they sent someone to find a shop, buy cooking utensils, prepare flour and cooking oil, and find a chef with good cooking skills to cook for them. After they came, we also tried our best to ensure they had enough to eat and a good place to stay. But unfortunately, after they helped transport only a few loads, they were full of complaints, either complaining that the food we cooked was not good or complaining that the rooms they stayed in were not good... After reluctantly helping transport for five days, they declared that they would no longer help transport and insisted on returning to Beijing early. We were really worried when we heard they were leaving because there were still more than three million sweet potato seedlings in Tangguantun that urgently needed to be transported to various places for planting. After our repeated requests to stay, it was still ineffective. Later, we reported this matter to the leadership. County Magistrate Ren Qianyi rushed to thank them and repeatedly asked them to stay for two more days, but was still refused.
    Not long after they left, military vehicles supporting drought resistance arrived. Without any conditions, they helped us transport the sweet potato seedlings to the planting areas on time. After this incident, the masses said that the People's Liberation Army comrades can endure hardship, and those automobile drivers should learn from the People's Liberation Army.

    应该向解放军同志学习
    5月11日，北京市汽车公司派了五位汽车司机同志开来五辆卡车帮助我县运薯秧七天。县领导上非常感谢他们的支援，在他们来到前，就派专人找好店房，买好炊事用具，准备了面粉和食油，并找一个厨艺较高的厨师给他们做饭。他们来后，我们也尽力让他们吃得饱，住得好。但是非常遗憾，他们帮助运了不几趟，就满腹牢骚，不是怪我们做的饭菜不好，就是嫌住的房间不好……。他们勉强帮助运了五天之后，就声明不再帮助运了，坚决要提前返回北京。我们一听他们要走，可真要急坏了。因为还有三百多万棵薯秧放在唐官屯，急需要运到各地去栽植。经过我们再三挽留，仍旧无效。后来我们向领导上汇报了这件事。任谦益县长立刻赶来向他们致谢，再三要求他们晚走两天，但仍然遭到拒绝。
    他们走了不久，支援抗旱部队的军用汽车开来了，他们不要任何条件，按时帮助我们把薯秧运到栽植地区。这件事发生后，群众都说，还是解放军同志能吃苦耐劳，那几个汽车司机同志应该向解放军学习。　　河北省文安县农林局　杨宗田、方景桐、刘继坤
