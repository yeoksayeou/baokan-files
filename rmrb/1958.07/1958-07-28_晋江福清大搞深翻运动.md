Fujian Daily News: Jinjiang and Fuqing counties in Fujian Province are vigorously promoting a deep plowing campaign. Jinjiang County has mobilized an army of 220,000 people, launching a deep plowing campaign for late rice and late sweet potato fields. As of the 12th, of the more than 121,000 mu of late sweet potato fields that had been transplanted, over 107,200 mu were deeply dug to about two chi (approx. 2/3 meter), and over 79,000 mu of late rice had been plowed, with a depth of over one chi (approx. 1/3 meter), and a few at about eight cun (approx. 27 cm).

During the deep digging, agricultural implement factories promptly produced and supplied 13,300 deep plows and a large number of soil raking tools to meet the needs of deep digging. The masses also continuously improved their tools to increase work efficiency. In Meixing Cooperative, Dongxing Township, a meeting of more than 20 plowmen was held to conduct technical discussions and study the deep digging method of using two oxen pulling a plow in tandem, which more than doubled the work efficiency. They used old plows for the first pass, followed by deep plows, and then six people raked the soil and cleared the ditches before deep plowing again. This only required eight workdays per mu, saving more than ten workdays compared to the original method.

Currently, the various townships are continuously increasing the number of people to ensure that the deep digging and transplanting of seedlings on more than 380,000 mu of late rice and late sweet potato fields is fully completed.

Fuqing County mobilized the entire population, fighting for 20 days and nights. All 174,100 mu of early sweet potato fields in the county have been universally deeply plowed to a depth of one to two and a half chi (approx. 1/3 - 5/6 meter). Among them, more than 50,000 mu of alkaline fields, low-lying areas, and rocky-bottomed fields that were not suitable for deep plowing, were also filled with five or six hundred to one thousand dan (1 dan = 50 kg) of soil fertilizer per mu to thicken the soil layer and improve the soil, ensuring a bumper harvest of early sweet potatoes. At present, the people of the county are summing up the experience of deep plowing in early sweet potato fields and have begun to continue deep plowing more than one chi (approx. 1/3 meter) deep in over 140,000 mu of late rice fields.

    晋江福清大搞深翻运动
    福建日报讯　福建省晋江、福清两县大搞深翻地运动，晋江县出动二十二万大军，掀起了晚稻、晚番薯田地的深耕深翻运动。到12日止，已经扦插的十二万一千多亩晚番薯田，其中深挖达二尺左右的占十万七千二百多亩，晚稻已翻犁七万九千多亩，深挖都在一尺以上，少数在八寸左右。
    在深挖中，各农具厂及时赶制和供应深耕犁一万三千三百多部以及大量的耙土工具，以供应深挖的需要。群众也不断改进工具，提高工效。东星乡美星社召开二十多人的犁手会议，进行技术座谈，研究了两牛连犁的深挖法，使工效提高一倍多。他们第一遍用旧犁，第二遍用深耕犁，六人进行耙土清沟土后再进行深犁，每亩只需八个工，比原来节省十多个工。
    现在，各乡正不断增加人数，保证晚稻、晚番薯三十八万多亩全面完成深挖和插秧插苗工作。
    福清县全民动员，奋战二十昼夜，全县十七万四千一百亩早番薯田地已经普遍深翻一尺至二尺半，其中五万多亩不宜深翻的碱性田、低洼地和石底田，每亩也挑进五、六百担至一千担土肥，以加厚土层，改良土壤，保证早番薯大丰收。目前全县人民正在总结早番薯田地深翻经验，开始在十四万多亩晚稻田中继续深耕一尺以上。
