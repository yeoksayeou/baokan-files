(Report from our correspondent in Moscow, July 8th) This year, barley and wheat are growing well throughout the Soviet Union, and a bumper harvest is expected. Currently, harvesting is being carried out intensely in the southern regions.

　　In the important grain-producing areas of the Russian Federal Republic, such as Kuban, Stavropol Krai, and the states along the Volga River, thousands of harvesters are working day and night in the wheat fields. Intense harvesting has also begun in the southern states of Ukraine. Reports from these areas indicate that the results of the first two days of harvesting are excellent, with grain yields reaching 23-25 quintals per hectare.

　　In this year's harvest, the collective farms in various regions have their own harvesting machines, so the harvesting work is better organized than in previous years, and the harvesting work in most areas can be completed in about ten days. For example, in Stavropol Krai, each harvester used to harvest an average of more than 30 hectares of land per day and night, while this year the average has reached more than 40 hectares. Some areas have even reached 60 hectares. In order to ensure rapid harvesting and reduce grain losses, more than 90% of the wheat fields in these areas have implemented the advanced staged harvesting method.

　　The southern regions of the Kazakh Republic, which are committed to delivering 1.5 billion poods of grain to the state this year, have begun intense harvesting. The wheat on the large tracts of newly cultivated land in this republic is growing very well. The main grain-producing areas of the republic, such as Kustanai and Akmolinsk, will also begin harvesting within the next two days. 120,000 harvesters and more than 34,000 combine operators and mechanics have now entered the harvesting front. The eastern granary of the Russian Federal Republic, Altai Krai, and the Siberian region have also entered the stage of active preparation for harvesting. Most of the harvesters have been repaired and will be fully投入 harvesting as soon as the harvesting date arrives.

　　To assist in the harvest, hundreds of thousands of young students from all over the Soviet Union have come to the harvest areas in batches to support the nationwide harvesting work that is currently underway.

    苏联南部地区开始收割
    大麦小麦丰收在望
    本报莫斯科8日电  今年苏联各地大麦小麦都长得很好，丰收在望。目前南部地区正在紧张地进行收割。
    在俄罗斯联邦共和国的重要产粮区，如库班、斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区、伏尔加河流域两岸各州的麦田里，成千上万的收割机昼夜不停地工作着。乌克兰南部各州也开始了紧张收割。这些地区传来的消息说，收割的头两天结果非常好，每公顷土地收获的粮食达到23—25公担。
    在今年的收割工作中，各地农庄都有了自己的收割机器，因此收割工作比往年组织得更好，大部分地区的收割工作可以在十天左右完成。如斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区，从前每架收割机每昼夜平均收割三十多公顷土地，而今年平均达到了四十多公顷。有的地区已达到六十公顷。为了保证快速收割，少损失粮食，这些地区90％以上的麦田实行了先进的分段收割法。
    保证今年要交给国家十五亿普特粮食的哈萨克共和国南部地区已开始了紧张的收割。这个共和国的大片新垦地的麦子长得都很好。共和国的主要产粮区库斯坦奈、阿克马林斯克等地，这两天内也要开始收割了。十二万名收割者，三万四千多名收割机手、机械手现已进入收割阵地。俄罗斯联邦共和国东部粮仓，阿尔泰边疆区、西伯利亚地区也进入了积极准备收割的阶段。大部收割机已修理妥当。收割日期来到就可以全部投入收割热潮。
    为了帮助收割，全苏各地成千上万的青年学生已分批来到收割地，支援全国正在紧张进行中的收割工作。
