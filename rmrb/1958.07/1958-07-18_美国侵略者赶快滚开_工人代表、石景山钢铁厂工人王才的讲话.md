    The American Aggressors Get Out Immediately!
    Speech by Worker Representative Wang Cai, Worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    When we workers heard that the Iraqi people had overthrown the reactionary dynasty, we were extremely happy. This is a victory for the Iraqi people and a victory for all peace-loving people in the world. When we heard that U.S. imperialism had launched an armed invasion of Lebanon, we were extremely angry. The workers operating the blast furnace were discussing it fervently in front of the furnace after finishing a batch of iron. Our hearts were boiling like molten iron, and we Chinese workers will never agree to it. The people of the world will never agree to it. We will never allow interference in the internal affairs of the Lebanese people, and we will never allow interference in the internal affairs of any country!
    The people of all countries have the freedom to choose their own government, and no one is allowed to interfere! The American invading troops must get out of Lebanon immediately! They must get out of our territory of Taiwan! They must get out of Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines!
    U.S. imperialism thinks it can use force to save its failing colonialism. This is a dream! Bayonets have never conquered the people! American bayonets did not conquer the Chinese people. We firmly believe that they will not conquer the Arab people either! Today is the era where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The strength of the socialist camp is growing stronger and stronger, the forces defending world peace are growing stronger and stronger, and the fire of national independence movements around the world is burning brighter and brighter. Imperialism will never be able to block our path!
    We workers are extremely angry at the U.S.'s criminal act of armed aggression against Lebanon! We must turn our anger into motivation. Our blast furnace workers changed to large air nozzles last night to increase pig iron production, determined to produce more steel and realize the task of building the capital's industrial base ahead of schedule, and do everything in our power to support the heroic struggle of the people of Lebanon and Iraq!
    Oppose the U.S. armed aggression against Lebanon!
    Long live the victory of the national independence movements of Asian and African countries!

    美国侵略者赶快滚开
    工人代表、石景山钢铁厂工人王才的讲话
    我们工人听说伊拉克人民把反动的王朝推翻了，我们真是万分的高兴。这是伊拉克人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。当我们又听说美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩，我们真是万分愤怒。正在高炉操作的工人，出完了一炉铁之后，就在炉前热烈地谈论起来。我们的心就像铁水一样沸腾，我们中国工人绝不答应。全世界人民绝不答应。我们绝不许干涉黎巴嫩人民的内政，绝不许干涉任何国家的内政！
    各国人民有选择自己政府的自由，绝不容许任何人干涉！美国侵略军必须立即从黎巴嫩滚出去！必须从我国领土台湾滚出去！必须从朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！
    美帝国主义以为他用武力可以挽救它殖民主义的失败，这是做梦！刺刀从来征服不了人民！美国刺刀没有征服了中国人民。我们深信，也征服不了阿拉伯人民！今天，是东风压倒西风的时代，社会主义阵营的力量，越来越强大，全世界保卫和平的力量，越来越强大；全世界民族独立运动的大火，越烧越旺。帝国主义要想挡住我们的道路，万万做不到！
    我们工人，对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩的罪恶行为，万分愤怒！我们要把愤怒化为干劲，我们高炉工人在昨天晚上就换上了大风嘴来提高生铁产量，决心生产更多的钢铁，提前实现建设首都工业基地的任务，尽我们的一切力量，来支援黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民的英勇斗争！
    反对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩！
    亚非各国民族独立运动胜利万岁！
