Folk Creations Like Brilliant Spring Flowers
Beijing Holds Folk Literature Exhibition

(Our newspaper dispatch) The "Chinese Folk Literature Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the China Folk Literature Research Association and the Beijing Library, opened on the 17th in the Beijing Library Exhibition Hall.

This exhibition prominently reflects the earth-shattering heroic spirit of the broad masses of Chinese working people in the great leap forward of socialist industrial and agricultural production, their unparalleled enthusiasm to express their happy lives today, and their high level of wisdom. Just as a large red poetry leaflet exhibited at the meeting wrote, "A great leap forward in the cultural revolution, today's people will surely surpass the ancients, creating hundreds of poems every day, surpassing the great poets of the Tang Dynasty." From the exhibition, one can see that in the past few months, the creation of folk literature, especially folk songs and ballads, throughout the country has blossomed like spring flowers everywhere, adding exceptionally magnificent colors to the motherland's culture. On display here are more than 1,000 publications of folk literature from most provinces in the country, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi Autonomous Region, Beijing, Shanghai, and the military since the Great Leap Forward, including books, magazines, newspapers, mimeographed booklets, mimeographed newspapers, poetry leaflets, and ballad leaflets in various forms. In addition, the exhibition also showcases many interesting wall poems, wall paintings, folk literature manuscripts, handwritten copies, and various photos and charts showing folk literature creation activities and publishing conditions.

The exhibition also displays publications of folk literature from various ethnic groups in ancient China, the "May Fourth" period, the various domestic revolutionary war periods, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and from the founding of New China to before the Great Leap Forward, as well as more than 1,000 notices and editorials from various Party committees and Party newspapers on collecting folk songs and ballads since the Great Leap Forward. These exhibits fully demonstrate the excellent tradition of Chinese folk literature and the Chinese Communist Party's concern and emphasis on folk literature.

    民间创作像灿烂的春花
    北京举行民间文学展览会
    本报讯  中国民间文艺研究会、北京图书馆联合主办的“中国民间文学展览会”17日在北京图书馆展览厅开幕。
    这个展览会突出地反映了中国广大劳动人民在社会主义工农业生产大跃进中的移山倒海的英雄气概，和他们要表现自己今天的幸福生活的无比热情以及他们的高度智慧。正像会上展览的一大幅红色诗传单上写的“文化革命大跃进，今人一定胜古人，每日创作诗百篇，赛过唐朝大诗人。”从展览会上，可以看到：几个月来，全国各地的民间文学尤其是民歌、民谣的创作，像春花遍地怒放，千红万紫，使祖国的文化增添了异常绚烂的色彩。这里展出的有全国绝大部分省、内蒙古、广西自治区、北京、上海二市和部队的大跃进以来的民间文学的出版物一千多件，其中有书籍、杂志、报纸、油印小册子、油印小报、诗传单、歌谣传单等各种各样的形式。另外，展览会还展出了许多引人兴趣的墙头诗、墙头画、民间文学、手稿、手抄本和各种表现民间文学创作活动的和出版情况的照片、图表。
    展览会还展出了我国古代、“五四”时期、各次国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期、以及新中国成立以来到大跃进以前的各民族民间文学的出版物，和大跃进以来各党委和党报关于收集的民歌、民谣的通知和社论共一千多件。这些展品充分地显示了中国民间文学的优秀传统、中国共产党对民间文学的关心和重视。
