Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd: According to TASS, New York, July 21st: 美联社 (Meilianshe) commentator Ryan, writing from Amman, stated that Soviet Chairman Khrushchev is trying to lower the temperature of the already heated international situation. His call for a high-level meeting to discuss the Middle East issue is a wise decision. If this call is accepted, Khrushchev will gain the honor of preventing a world war. If this proposal is rejected, the United States will bear the responsibility for the terrible adventures that follow.

Ryan said that, regardless, the West's influence in the Middle East is rapidly declining.

The American journalist also pointed out that the constant flow of American and British weapons and soldiers into the Middle East cannot achieve the goals of the Western countries. He wrote that these desperate measures can, at best, only delay the ultimate punishment. Once the moment of reckoning arrives, the West will almost certainly suffer a complete defeat.

"The New York Times" says:

    Military Force Cannot Suppress the Anti-Imperialist Rage in the Middle East

This newspaper said: "All the armed forces of the United States and Britain combined cannot extinguish the flames of anti-imperialist rage in the Middle East. This is an unavoidable fact, and it can be said that the root of the current crisis is that the United States has failed to cooperate with Arab nationalism once it became an irresistible force."

"The New York Times" admitted that "the forces at work in the Middle East are very complex and powerful." It argued that the United States "needs to be very careful and employ high-level diplomacy" to keep the current aggression "limited to the smallest scope and the shortest time."

"Stone's Weekly" says:

    The United States Completely Misjudged Arab Countries

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: New York News: The American "Stone's Weekly" published a commentary today entitled "Gunboat Diplomacy in the Hydrogen Bomb Age," criticizing the US government's dispatch of troops to invade Lebanon.

The commentary believes that the US government's reckless launching of the invasion of Lebanon, "as if the world today were still the world of 1900, as if Lebanon were a banana republic on our doorstep, as if the most powerful weapon were still the machine gun. It is conceivable that this approach by the US government could become the beginning of the last struggle on this planet."

The commentary pointed out: If the United States insists on armed intervention in Lebanon, it can only lead the United States "into a military quagmire, into our own Algeria (many times larger than France's Algerian affair), into a situation where oil wells and pipelines are at the mercy of guerrillas." It continued: "We were caught off guard in Iraq, and this fact cannot be seen merely as the failure of the CIA's spies to detect a conspiracy. It should be seen as a reflection of our political failure to correctly assess the actual situation of an Arab ally. In this country, the Iraqi army used our military supplies to turn against us. Obviously, this uprising, which we knew nothing about beforehand, was not launched temporarily overnight. If we did so badly in Iraq, why do we think we can control the entire Arab world?"

The commentary concluded that American propaganda prevents it from seeing the facts. The United States should recognize the right of Arabs to attain a respected position in the world. The landing of Marines in Beirut is enough to unite the entire Arab world against us. This will be one of the most serious mistakes in American military and diplomatic history.

"The Wall Street Journal" points out:

    The Situation in the Middle East Will Not Change Due to American Intervention

According to Xinhua News Agency, "The Wall Street Journal" admitted in its July 17th editorial that the American invasion of Lebanon is a gamble.

The newspaper said: "In the past few years, our efforts have been focused on keeping the Arab world divided." The newspaper admitted that American activities have become "increasingly difficult."

"The Wall Street Journal" called the US troop deployment to Lebanon a "gamble," "a last action taken to save what remains of our position in the Middle East."

However, the newspaper also pointed out that the American invasion of Lebanon cannot save the failure of colonial policy, saying: "All the basic forces at work in the Middle East will not change because of intervention in Lebanon. We still have the exact same problems after the Marines landed as we had before the Marines landed."

"New York Herald Tribune" Reporter Reveals:

    Eisenhower Deeply Disturbed by the Situation in the United Nations

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: According to TASS, New York, July 20th: According to a report from Washington by "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Donovan, the United States' attempt to force the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution to legitimize American intervention in Lebanon and obtain the cover of the United Nations flag has failed. This failure and the overall mood of the United Nations have caused "serious concern" to the US government.

Donovan pointed out that the United States is trying to put pressure on UN member states, therefore bluntly saying that the United States "does not intend to withdraw from Lebanon" "until the United Nations can send troops to replace (American troops)." "If the United Nations cannot guarantee the provision of international troops, then American armed intervention in Lebanon may be extended indefinitely."

Eisenhower held a meeting with the leaders of both parties in the Senate at the White House on the evening of the 19th regarding this matter.

Donovan said that, according to one participant in the meeting, Eisenhower expressed disappointment that some of America's friends, including Latin American countries, had not more fully supported the United States in the United Nations.

### 侵略者逃不脱最终的惩罚  美国舆论认为美英干涉中东将会一败涂地

    侵略者逃不脱最终的惩罚
    美国舆论认为美英干涉中东将会一败涂地
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社纽约21日讯：美联社评论员瑞安自安曼写道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫试图降低已经白热化的国际局势的温度。他的召开高级会议讨论中东问题的呼吁，是一个明智的决定。如果这个呼吁被接受，赫鲁晓夫就将获得防止世界大战的荣誉。如果这个建议被拒绝，美国就将承担对随之而来的可怕的冒险的责任。
    瑞安说，但是，不管怎么样，西方在中东的影响正在迅速下降。
    这位美国记者还指出，美英的武器和士兵不断运入中东，但是，武器和士兵并不能使西方国家达到它们的目的。他写道，这种绝望挣扎的措施最好不过只能延缓最终的惩罚。一旦惩罚的时刻到来，西方几乎要一败涂地。
    “纽约时报”说
    武力镇压不了中东反帝怒潮
    本报讯  “纽约时报”18日发表社论，承认美英用武力镇压不了中东人民的反帝怒潮。
    这家报纸说：“美国和英国的武装部队全部合起来也无法扑灭中东的烽火。这是不能不接受的事实，而且可以这样说，在阿拉伯民族主义一旦成了不可抗拒的力量之后美国没有能够同它合作，这是目前危机的根源。”
    “纽约时报”承认“在中东起作用的势力是十分复杂和强大的”，它主张美国“需要十分小心和运用高度的外交手腕，”使现在的侵略行动“限于最小的范围和最短的时间内。”
    “斯通周刊”说
    美国对阿拉伯国家估计完全错误
    新华社21日讯  纽约消息：美国“斯通周刊”今天以“氢弹时代的炮舰外交”为题发表评论，抨击美国政府派遣军队侵略黎巴嫩。
    评论认为，美国政府悍然不顾一切发动对黎巴嫩的侵略，“就好像今天的世界仍然是1900年的世界似的，就好像黎巴嫩是我们门槛上的一个香蕉共和国似的，就好像最厉害的武器仍然是机关枪似的。可以设想，美国政府的这种作法可能成为这个星球上最后的斗争的开端。”
    评论指出：如果美国坚持对黎巴嫩的武装干涉，只能够把美国“引到军事沼泽中去，引到一个（比法国的阿尔及利亚事件）大好多倍的我们自己的阿尔及利亚事件中去，引到油井和输油管会在游击队的摆布之下的局面中去”。它接着写道：“在伊拉克我们被人打了个措手不及不能够把这个事实仅仅看成是中央情报局的间谍没有能够发现阴谋。应该把它看成是反映了我们在政治上没有能够正确地估计一个阿拉伯盟国的实际情况。在这个国家，伊拉克军队用我们的军事物资反过来对付我们。显然，我们事先丝毫不知道的这次起义并不是一夜之间临时发动起来的。如果我们在伊拉克干得如此不好，我们又为什么认为我们能够控制整个阿拉伯世界呢？”
    这篇评论最后写道，美国自己的宣传使它看不见事实。美国应该承认阿拉伯人在世界上得到受尊敬的地位的权利。海军陆战队在贝鲁特登陆的行动适足使得整个阿拉伯世界团结一致反对我们。这将是美国军事和外交历史上所犯的最严重的错误之一。
    “华尔街日报”指出
    中东形势不会因美国干涉而改变
    据新华社讯  “华尔街日报”在7月17日的社论中承认，美国侵略黎巴嫩是一个冒险。
    这家报纸说：“在过去几年中，我们的努力都是集中在使阿拉伯世界处于分裂状态中。”这家报纸承认美国的活动已经“愈来愈困难了”。
    “华尔街日报”把美国出兵黎巴嫩称作一种“冒险”，“是为了挽救我们在中东所剩余的地位而采取的一种最后行动。”
    但是，这家报纸又指出，美国侵略黎巴嫩并不能挽救殖民政策的失败，它说：“在中东起作用的一切基本力量都不会因干涉黎巴嫩而有所变化。我们在海军陆战队登陆以后仍持有与海军陆战队登陆以前完全一样的问题。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者透露
    艾森豪威尔对联合国情况深感不安
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社纽约20日讯：据“纽约先驱论坛报”记者杜诺万自华盛顿报道，美国想要强使联合国安全理事会通过决议，使美国对黎巴嫩的干涉合法化并且得到联合国旗帜的掩护的企图已经失败，这个失败以及联合国的总的情绪引起了美国政府的“严重忧虑”。
    杜诺万指出，美国企图对联合国成员国施加压力，因此断然地说，“在联合国不能派军队去代替（美国军队）之前”，美国“不打算从黎巴嫩撤军”，“如果联合国不能保证提供国际军队，那末，美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉可能无限期地延长下去”。
    19日晚上艾森豪威尔就此事在白宫同参议院两党领袖举行了会议。
    杜诺万说，据会议的一个参加者说，艾森豪威尔对美国的一些朋友，包括拉丁美洲各国在内，没有在联合国更充分地支持美国表示失望。
