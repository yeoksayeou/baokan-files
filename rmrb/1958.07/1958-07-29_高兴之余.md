Title: Amidst the Joy

After finishing the compilation of the news on the national hog development, I felt very happy. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, hog production has also experienced a great leap forward - the number of hogs raised in the first half of the year has exceeded the national plan for this year by 22.9%; if calculated according to the average number of hogs raised per household nationwide, it basically meets the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for 1962. This is a major event, because the rapid development of hog production will first lead to a large increase in farm manure, and the increase in fertilizer will create conditions for achieving an even greater autumn harvest. How could this not make people happy?! However, amidst the joy, I can't help but think of a question - why is it that with the large-scale development of hog production, the readers' letters reflecting the tight supply of pork have increased compared to the past? Moreover, the areas from which the letters come are also wider than before. What is the reason for this?

It is not a big problem if people eat less meat, or even do not eat meat for a short period. However, if there is only development of hog production without corresponding consumption, this is a big problem. Because the purpose of raising pigs is not for the sake of raising pigs, nor is it solely for the purpose of accumulating fertilizer. Farmers can increase their income by selling the pigs they raise; the state can purchase pigs to meet the food needs of urban people, develop the meat processing industry, and increase export goods. If hog production develops, but the work of the purchasing departments does not keep up, then the result will not only be that people in some areas feel the meat supply is tight, but it will also directly affect the enthusiasm of farmers to raise pigs. The seriousness of the problem lies here.

It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue, study it, and solve it.

    高兴之余
    编完了全国生猪发展的消息，心里非常高兴。在工农业生产大跃进中，生猪生产也来了个大跃进——上半年养猪数量已经超过今年国家计划22.9％；如果按全国农户平均养猪头数计算，基本上达到农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的1962年的要求。这是一件大事，因为生猪生产迅速发展的结果，首先是农家肥料的大量增加，而肥料的增加也就为取得秋季更大丰收创造了条件。这怎能不让人高兴呢？！但是，高兴之余，不竟想起了一个问题——为什么在生猪大量发展的情况下，读者反映猪肉供应紧张的来信反比过去增多了呢？而且来信的地区也比过去广，这是什么原因呢？
    人们少吃些肉，甚至在短时期内不吃肉，这个问题不算大。可是，如果生猪只有发展，而没有相应地消耗，这倒是个大问题。因为人们养猪的目的，不是为养猪而养猪，也不只是为了积肥才养猪。农民把养的猪卖了还能增加收入；国家收买了猪可以供应城市人民的食用需要，可以发展肉食加工工业，可以增加出口物资。如果生猪生产发展了，收购部门的工作没有跟上，那么，结果就不仅仅是有些地区的人民感到肉食供应紧，而且会直接影响到农民养猪的积极性。问题的严重性就在这里。
    希望有关部门重视这问题，研究它，解决它。
