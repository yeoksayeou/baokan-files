Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 18th: The National Congress of the French Communist Party, which opened on the 17th, closed today. The conference unanimously adopted a letter to the French people, calling on republicans to unite and organize the masses to fight back against attacks by fascist thugs, and to launch a propaganda campaign against de Gaulle's conspiracy, in order to prompt the French people to reject de Gaulle's "new draft constitution" in the referendum on October 5th.

The National Congress of the French Communist Party was held in Montreuil, near Paris. The main agenda of the conference was: to unite all those who support the republican system, oppose the referendum, and oppose the personal and military dictatorship that paves the way for fascism.

The letter to the people pointed out that de Gaulle re-used the leaders and planners of the military rebellion in Algiers, who established a military dictatorship in Algeria and implemented fascist terror policies. The purpose of the de Gaulle government's decision to hold a referendum is to legitimize the above regime and extend it to mainland France. De Gaulle directly represents the big capitalist colonialists and warmongers. He also pursues a foreign policy dependent on the United States in the Middle East and elsewhere.

The letter to the people said that the French people demand a change of policy, respect for the democratic system, improved living standards, peace in Algeria, and the establishment of new relations with the oppressed people based on the principle of voluntarism.

The letter to the people emphasized that the French people can win this great struggle. Socialists, Radical Socialists, Catholics, and democrats unite with the Communist Party to organize thousands of committees to defend the Republic in order to mobilize the masses for struggle.

French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez, at the opening of the French Communist Party National Congress on the 17th, called on communists to stand at the forefront of the great struggle to save the rights of the French working masses and the future of the country, and to fight for world peace. He said, "Communists will fight against any diplomatic or military pressure, against any intervention in Lebanon or Iraq. They will fight to prevent a repeat of the bloody Suez adventure and to win the right for all peoples to control their own destiny and to control their own natural wealth."

Thorez pointed out that in order to prepare for the upcoming referendum, it is necessary to carry out huge political work among the masses. Thorez then described the French Communist Party's proposal for formulating a program of action for all left-wing parties and groups, saying, "This program should guarantee the material basis for national independence, improve the living standards of the working people, and protect and expand their rights... This program should also include guaranteeing and expanding democratic freedoms. It will also be a program for easing international tensions and disarmament. On the issue of relations with the people of colonial countries, this program should put forward solutions that are completely in line with the spirit of the times."

Thorez said, "It is necessary to unite all democrats, socialists and non-socialists, non-religious and Christians, left-wing republicans and more moderate republicans, all of whom have their place in joint action, and it is particularly important to attract socialist working masses to participate in these actions... The united front is action. First of all, this is to organize a massive mass movement, a nationwide movement, in order to declare in the referendum no to dictatorship, no to adventure, no to war."

Thorez then evaluated the party's activities in recent times. He said, "Our Communist Party has gloriously withstood the test of recent events. Only the Communist Party resolutely and unitedly fought against dictatorship, and the people saw again that our party is different from other parties. We bring hope to all who oppose shame and oppose fascist terror." He said that since the anti-republican riots that took place in Algiers on May 13, the French Communist Party has recruited 6,000 new members, and 4,000 have joined the French Communist Youth League. At the same time, the circulation of communist newspapers has doubled during the various events that have occurred recently.

Before the closing of the National Congress of the French Communist Party, Party Secretary Jacques Duclos spoke, pointing out the importance of the struggle tasks put forward in the letter to the people. He said that fighting back against fascist thugs will make the masses realize their strength and the effectiveness of struggle. He also pointed out that workers, civil servants, and small and medium farmers, especially intellectuals, do not support de Gaulle and are increasingly resentful of military dictatorship. As long as we can organize everyone to take action, and carry out the indispensable struggle on the ideological front, to crush the arguments of the splitters, eliminate doubts, and overcome possible hesitations, our united front policy will surely produce good results.

    法共全国代表会议呼吁全国人民
    否决戴高乐的“新宪法草案”
    多列士号召为制止侵略中东而斗争
    据新华社巴黎18日电　17日开幕的法国共产党全国代表会议，在今天闭幕。会议一致通过了告法国人民书，呼吁共和人士团结起来，组织群众反击法西斯暴徒的袭击，并且针对戴高乐的阴谋展开宣传运动，以便促使法国人在10月5日举行公民投票时否决戴高乐的“新宪法草案”。
    法国共产党全国代表会议是在巴黎近郊蒙特勒伊举行的。会议的主要议程是：一切拥护共和制的人统一行动，反对全民投票，反对为法西斯开辟道路的个人独裁和军事独裁。
    告人民书指出，戴高乐重用在阿尔及尔发动军事暴乱的首领和策划者，这些人在阿尔及利亚设立军事独裁，并且执行法西斯恐怖政策。而戴高乐政府决定举行公民投票，其目的就是要使上述政权合法化，并且把它扩及法国本土。戴高乐直接代表大资本殖民主义者和战争贩子。他还执行在中东及其他地方依附美国的外交政策。
    告人民书说，法国人民要求改变政策，要求使民主体制受到尊重，要求提高生活水平，要求在阿尔及利亚实现和平，并且在自愿原则下同被压迫人民建立新的关系。
    告人民书强调指出，法国人民能够在这一场伟大的斗争中获得胜利。社会党人、激进社会党人、天主教徒和民主人士同共产党团结一致，组织成千的保卫共和国委员会，以便发动群众进行斗争。
    法国共产党总书记多列士在17日开幕的法国共产党全国代表会议上号召共产党员站在为拯救法国劳动群众的权利和国家的未来而进行的伟大斗争的最前列，并且为世界和平而斗争。他说，“共产党员将为反对任何外交压力或军事压力、为反对对黎巴嫩或伊拉克进行任何干涉而斗争。他们将为制止血腥的苏伊士冒险行动的重演、为争取各国人民掌握自己的命运和支配本国天然财富的权利而斗争。”
    多列士指出，为了准备迎接即将到来的全民投票，必须在群众中进行巨大的政治工作。多列士接着叙述了法国共产党提出的有关制定一切左翼党派和团体的行动纲领的建议，他说，“这个纲领应当保证国家独立的物质基础，提高劳动人民的生活水平，保护和扩大他们的权利……这个纲领还应当包括保证和扩大民主自由。它还将是缓和国际紧张局势和裁军的纲领。在有关同殖民地国家人民的关系问题上，这个纲领应当提出完全符合于时代精神的解决办法。”
    多列士说，“必须联合所有的民主人士、社会党人和非社会党人、非教徒和基督教徒、左翼共和党人和更温和的共和党人，所有这些人在联合行动中都有自己的位置，而吸引社会党劳动群众参加这些行动是特别重要的……统一战线，就是行动。首先，这是组织声势浩大的群众运动，全民运动，以便在全民投票时宣布不要专政，不要冒险，不要战争。”
    多列士接着对党在最近时期的活动，作了评价。他说，“我们共产党光荣地经受住了最近一些事件的考验。只有共产党坚决地和团结一致地进行了反独裁的斗争，人民再次看到，我们党同其他政党是不同的。我们给反对耻辱和反对法西斯恐怖的一切人带来希望。”他说，自5月13日在阿尔及尔发生反对共和的暴乱以来，法国共产党吸收了六千名新党员，有四千人加入了法国共产主义青年联盟。同时，在近来发生的各种事件期间，共产党报纸的出版份数增加了一倍。
    在法国共产党全国代表会议闭幕之前，党的书记杜克洛讲了话，指出告人民书中所提出的斗争任务的重要性。他说，反击法西斯暴徒将使群众认识到自己的力量和斗争的有效。他还指出，工人、公务员和中小农民，特别是知识分子，是不拥护戴高乐的，他们越来越痛恨军事独裁。只要我们能够组织大家起来行动，能够在思想战线上进行不可缺少的斗争，来粉碎分裂分子的论点，消除疑虑和克服可能出现的犹豫，我们的统一阵线政策就一定会产生良好的效果。
