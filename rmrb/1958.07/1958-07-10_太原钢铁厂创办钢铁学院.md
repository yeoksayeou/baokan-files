Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 9th: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Institute, founded by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, has begun to enroll new students.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Institute is a regular university expanded from the original amateur iron and steel college. It offers majors in steel pressure processing, iron and steel metallurgy, metallurgical machinery and equipment, and chemical industry. In addition, there is a special class for veteran cadres, offering a major in iron and steel metallurgy. The institute already has 265 students and will enroll another 400 this year.

This new type of institute boldly changes the old academic system, adopting three methods: part-work and part-study, amateur, and full-time study, and shortening the study period. Students will reach the level of junior college or university graduation in one and a half and three years, respectively. It will make full use of the scientific research and production equipment of the factory and mine for teaching and experimentation. Engineers and technicians from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and teachers from the Taiyuan Institute of Technology will also serve as teachers at the Iron and Steel Institute.

Now, relying on its own strength, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has established a complete set of cultural and educational institutions for workers, from primary school to university. Currently, more than 10,000 people are participating in learning. The workers have a high enthusiasm for learning, with an attendance rate of over 90%.

    太原钢铁厂创办钢铁学院
    新华社太原9日电太原钢铁厂创办的太原钢铁学院已开始招收新生。
    太原钢铁学院是在原有的业余钢铁学院的基础上扩充成立的正规大学，设有钢铁压力加工、钢铁冶金、冶金机械设备、化学工业等专业；此外还有一个老干部特别班，设钢铁冶金专业。学院已有学生二百六十五名，今年将再招收四百名。
    这个新型的学院大胆地改变旧的学制，采取半工半读、业余、脱产三种方式，并且缩短学习期限，学生们将在一年半和三年的时间分别达到专科以上或大学毕业的水平。它将充分利用厂矿的科学研究和生产设备，进行教学和实验。太原钢铁厂的工程师、技术员和太原工学院教师兼任钢铁学院的教学工作。
    现在，太原钢铁厂依靠自己的力量，已经建立起一套从小学到大学的职工文化教育机构。目前参加学习的共有一万多人。职工们学习的积极性很高，出勤率达到90％以上。
