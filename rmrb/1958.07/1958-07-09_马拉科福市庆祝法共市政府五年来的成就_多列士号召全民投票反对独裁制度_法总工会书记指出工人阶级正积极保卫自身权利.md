Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 7th - The city of Malakoff, France, yesterday celebrated the achievements of the Communist Party in power in the city for the past five years. The Communist municipal government has exceeded the guarantees made in its program when it was elected five years ago.

The General Secretary of the French Communist Party and member of the French National Assembly for Malakoff, Maurice Thorez, also participated in the congratulatory ceremony for the mayor of the city, Leon Zarrania, and the Communist municipal council members. After visiting the achievements in housing, schools, canteens, kindergartens, health and sports facilities, the guests arrived at the Marcel Sédan Stadium. Thorez delivered an important speech there.

Thorez pointed out that De Gaulle's Algerian policy is to continue and intensify the expansion of the war.

Regarding social issues, Thorez pointed out that part of the gold loan was given to capitalists, wage earners were denied wage adjustments according to the price index, and wealthy tax evaders were pardoned. Moreover, landlords are allowed to freely raise rents. This makes the burden on the working people even heavier.

Thorez said that the fascist program of the "Committee of Public Safety" requires the banning of all political parties. Freedom of the press has become nominal due to repeated confiscation of newspapers. Fascists, with the connivance of the police and the government, have repeatedly attacked the offices of workers' and democratic organizations.

Thorez said that today, some people are preparing to make the dictatorial system a permanent fixture and to establish this system on the basis of a new constitution. The significance of the so-called referendum scheduled for October 5 this year lies in this. Thorez finally called on democratic workers to oppose the dictatorial system, oppose adventure, and oppose war in the October referendum. He said that in this great battle, the unity of the working class and the union of all democratic forces are urgently needed factors.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 7th - Léon Mauvais, Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor of France, published an article in "l'Humanité" this morning, pointing out that the French working class will more actively launch activities to defend their rights and demands and oppose the poverty policy and colonial war policy implemented by the De Gaulle government.

The article pointed out that while the government is calling on workers and their families to give up their demands and tighten their belts, it is vigorously issuing public bonds to benefit the privileged class. The government announced that another 67 billion francs of supplementary expenses will be invested in the abyss of the Algerian war, while Pinay is still in a hurry to announce that capital will not be taxed.

The article said that the working class is extremely uneasy and dissatisfied, especially because the movement against the rights already acquired by the working class, social insurance and other systems and regulations has been strengthened. Therefore, activists and trade union organizations will be more active than ever in launching activities to demand rights, while safeguarding their freedom—the freedom to defend bread and peace.

Mauvais pointed out that the working people criticize and expose those who oppose workers' unity and support the capitalists' and De Gaulle's excessive exploitation policies. At the same time, they will act in unison to force the acceptance of their just demands. They will vote no in the referendum held by De Gaulle, and they will demand more resolutely than ever the establishment of peace in Algeria through negotiations.

    马拉科福市庆祝法共市政府五年来的成就
    多列士号召全民投票反对独裁制度
    法总工会书记指出工人阶级正积极保卫自身权利
    新华社巴黎7日电  法国马拉科福市昨天庆祝了共产党在这个市执政五年来的成就，共产党市政府在这五年中超额完成了它当选时在纲领中所作的保证。
    法国共产党总书记、法国国民议会马拉科福市议员多列士也参加了对这个城市市长列翁·扎拉尼亚市长和共产党市政委员的祝贺典礼。各来宾在参观了住宅、学校、食堂、婴儿园、卫生和体育设备等各方面的成就以后，都来到马赛尔·塞当体育场。多列士在那里发表了重要演说。
    多列士指出：戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策就是继续和加紧扩大战争。
    关于社会问题，多列士指出，黄金借款一部分给了资本家，对工资领取者拒绝按物价指数调整工资，赦免了那些富有的漏税者。而且允许房主自由地抬高房租。这使得劳动人民的负担更加沉重。
    多列士说：“救国委员会”的法西斯纲领要求取缔各政党。新闻自由由于一再没收报纸而变得名存实亡。法西斯分子在警察和政府的同谋下一再地袭击工人组织和民主组织的办公所。
    多列士说，今天，有人准备使独裁制度成为定局、要使这种制度建立在新的宪法基础上。规定在今年10月5日举行的所谓全民选举的意义即在于此。多列士最后号召拥护民主的劳动者在10月的全民投票中反对独裁制度、反对冒险、反对战争。他说，在这场伟大的战斗中，工人阶级的团结和一切民主力量的联合是迫不急待的因素。
    新华社巴黎7日电  法国总工会书记利昂·摩维今晨在“人道报”发表文章指出，法国工人阶级将更加积极地展开活动，保卫自身的权利要求，反对戴高乐政府执行的贫困政策和殖民战争政策。
    文章指出，政府在号召工人及其家属放弃权利要求、勒紧腰带的同时，却在大张旗鼓地发行为特权阶级牟利的公债。政府宣布又有六百七十亿法郎的补充费用投入阿尔及利亚战争深渊，而比内却还慌忙宣布不会对资本征税。
    文章说，工人阶级极为不安和不满，这特别是因为反对工人阶级已经获得的权利、社会保险等制度和法规的运动加强了。因此，积极分子和各工会组织将比以往任何时候更加积极主动地展开要求权利的活动，同时维护他们的自由——保卫面包和和平的自由。
    摩维指出，劳动人民抨击和揭露那些反对工人团结、支持资本家和戴高乐的超额剥削政策的人。同时，他们将一致行动，以强令接受他们正义的权利要求。他们将在戴高乐举行公民投票时投否决票，他们比以往更加坚决地要求通过谈判建立阿尔及利亚的和平。
