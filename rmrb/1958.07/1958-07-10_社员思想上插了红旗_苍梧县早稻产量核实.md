Commune members' minds have been planted with red flags: Cangwu County re-verifies early rice yield.

    Guangxi Daily News: For over half a month, Cangwu County has been carrying out ideological education against concealing production, raising the consciousness of the masses. It has uncovered over 500,000 jin of concealed rice this year, increasing the actual yield of the county's harvested early rice (over 70,000 mu) from 301 jin per mu (wet grain, same below) to 428 jin.

    After the Grain in Ear, Cangwu County began to harvest early rice successively. However, the reported yields from various places were extremely low. In particular, many areas with historically high yields, good natural conditions, cultivation techniques, and vigorous crops, reported lower yields than areas with poor conditions. Shiqiao Township is a well-known low-yield area in the county, and its cultivation techniques this year were not good, but the yield per mu was still over 400 jin, while Shengzhou Commune, a famous high-yield commune, only had a yield of over 300 jin per mu. The nine townships with high yields in Jiangnan were all lower than the townships in Jiangbei. This abnormal phenomenon attracted the attention of the county party committee. On June 16, the county party committee instructed leaders of various townships to go deep into the investigation of the reasons. The party secretary of Hetou Township personally tried harvesting two plots of land. One plot of 0.4 mu yielded 440 jin, a yield of 1,100 jin per mu, and the other plot yielded 940 jin per mu. However, the average yield per mu in the township at that time was only over 200 jin. Further investigation revealed that some people with serious capitalist ideas used methods such as overreporting land area, disrupting accounts, reporting old scales as new scales, and reporting dry grain as wet grain to conceal production, generally concealing about 10%, and in severe cases, more than 40%.

    Therefore, the county party committee successively held two meetings of township party committee secretaries and two meetings of more than 14,000 team cadres (conducted by township). At the meetings, comparisons were made between regions, and between this year and last year's technical measures, climate and annual conditions, and crop vigor, affirming that this year's low yield was an abnormal phenomenon. At the same time, the cadres were educated with the concealed production facts that had been exposed, and a large-scale debate was launched on the harm of concealing production, raising the cadres' awareness. Subsequently, the same education was conducted among the masses, launching a mass debate, big-character poster movement, and confession to the Party. After the masses' awareness was raised, many concealed production groups were exposed.

    The Guangxi Daily commentator published an article on this matter, saying: Eliminating the phenomenon of concealing production and dividing privately is an important task in the summer harvest pre-distribution.

    Solving this problem should not wait until after the event has occurred to find ways to remedy it; instead, forceful measures should be taken in advance to prevent it. The fundamental way is to plant red flags in the minds of commune members, so that everyone consciously safeguards the collective interests. This requires educating commune members to correctly understand the relationship between individuals and the collective, the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and to establish the socialist ideology of loving the commune, loving the collective, and prioritizing the public before the private. The capitalist ideological behavior of concealing production and dividing privately must be thoroughly discredited, so that every commune member recognizes that concealing production and dividing privately is a shameful behavior that harms others and benefits oneself, and destroys collective interests, making it a "street rat" that everyone hates and shouts at. In this way, it will have no market. On this basis, supplemented by various systems, strict procedures between various work links, and supervision by everyone, plugging large and small loopholes, the phenomenon of concealing production can be completely eliminated.

### 社员思想上插了红旗  苍梧县早稻产量核实

    社员思想上插了红旗  苍梧县早稻产量核实
    广西日报讯  半个多月来，苍梧县开展反对瞒产的思想教育，提高了群众觉悟，查出今年瞒产稻谷五十多万斤，使全县今年已收割的七万多亩早稻实产量由每亩三百零一斤（湿谷以下同）提高到了四百二十八斤。
    芒种以后，苍梧县早稻陆续收割，但是，各地报来的产量极低，特别是许多历来产量高，自然条件、耕作技术、禾势都比较好的地区，产量反比不上条件差的地区。石桥乡是全县著名的低产地区，今年的耕作技术并不好，但亩产也有四百多斤，而著名的高产社——胜州社，亩产只有三百多斤。江南产量高的九个乡，都比江北各乡的产量低。这个反常现象，引起了县委的注意。县委在6月16日指示各乡领导深入去检查原因。河头乡党委书记亲自试割两丘田，一丘四分田，收四百四十斤，亩产一千一百斤，另一丘亩产九百四十斤。但该乡一般亩产量当时只有二百多斤。再深入检查原因，发现一些资本主义思想严重的人采用多报田亩、搞乱账目、老秤报新秤、干谷报湿谷等办法来瞒报产量，一般瞒产10％左右，严重的瞒产40％以上。
    于是，县委先后召开了两次乡党委书记会议，和两次一万四千多人的队干部会议（分乡进行）。在会上，对比地区与地区，今年的和去年的技术措施、气候和年景、禾势等，肯定今年的产量低是不正常现象。同时用已经揭发出来的瞒产事实教育干部，就瞒产的危害性开展大辩论，提高了干部的认识。接着在群众中进行同样的教育，开展群众性的大辩论、大字报运动和向党交心等活动。群众觉悟提高以后，揭发出很多瞒产集团。
    广西日报评论员为此事发表文章说：杜绝瞒产私分现象，是夏收预支中一项重要的工作。
    解决这个问题不要等事情发生之后，才去设法补救；而要在事前采取有力的措施加以防止。根本的办法，是在社员思想中插上红旗，使人人自觉地维护集体利益，这就必须教育社员正确认识个人与集体的关系、积累与消费的关系，树立爱社、爱集体、先公后私的社会主义思想，把瞒产私分的资本主义思想行为彻底搞臭，使每个社员都认识瞒产私分是一种损人利己、破坏集体利益的可耻行为，使它成为人人厌恶、人人喊打的“过街老鼠”，这样，它就没有市场了。在这一基础上，再辅之以各种制度，严格各个工作环节之间的手续，人人加以监督，堵塞大大小小的漏洞，就可彻底消灭瞒产现象了。
