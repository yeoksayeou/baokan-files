Steel Commander's "Chess Game"
　　Qian Yin

　　Everyone knows that Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) and Baotou Steel (Baogang) are the largest modern iron and steel complexes that China currently has and will soon build. Now they are setting up a wonderful chess game:

　　Before the end of this year, An'gang will build more than two hundred small and medium-sized blast furnaces and more than fifty small and medium-sized converters. Baogang will build a "small Baogang." In such huge enterprises, building small furnaces next to large furnaces, running small enterprises within large enterprises, and combining large, medium, and small scales is another pioneering undertaking.

　　In the eyes of some people, large enterprises have large-scale modern equipment, and their labor organization, plant layout, production lines, etc., are all laid out on a large scale. Since everything is large, as long as the strengths of the large scale are fully utilized, products can be produced at high speed and in large quantities, without the need to combine large, medium, and small scales. But that may not be the case. There are many benefits to large enterprises using small and medium-sized equipment. First of all, large enterprises have a solid foundation, and as long as all aspects are slightly tightened, small and insignificant equipment can be made available in large quantities; secondly, in terms of raw materials, large enterprises will inevitably have a lot of "scraps," which may not be cost-effective to process with large equipment, while small and medium-sized equipment can economically and rationally use these raw materials; thirdly, large enterprises have strong technical forces, and drawing a group to engage in a few small production units will not affect the original production. More importantly, with a complete set of large, medium, and small scales, leap forward targets can take flight, and productive forces can be developed more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　If you don't believe it, the facts of An'gang and Baogang can convince you. More than 90% of the equipment and materials needed for the construction of An'gang's two hundred small and medium-sized blast furnaces and fifty converters are made by utilizing old equipment and solving the problem themselves, without the state providing money. The iron ore is also "leftovers" from the large furnaces. The construction force is also contracted by the original factories and mines through division of labor. This is truly a brilliant chess move that achieves more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　Originally, combining large, medium, and small scales, with small and medium as the mainstay, and developing from small to large, is a fast and good method. The current problem is to liberate thinking, put down the airs of large factories, and not feel that it is disgraceful for large enterprises to engage in small equipment. Once the ideological obstacles are swept away, the enthusiasm will rise.

　　Not long ago, some people doubted: "Halving investment, doubling output, and completing five years of work in three years" was just a slogan. Now there are not many doubters in this regard, but in their view, old factories and large enterprises building small blast furnaces is still a question mark. Now, the "prosperity of large, medium, and small" and "many children and grandchildren" in large enterprises have become a reality, and the effect is very good, so this question mark can also be removed.

　　Today, with steel as the key link and the whole people grasping steel, in order to produce more steel at a faster speed, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has set up a chess game combining large, medium, and small scales in An'gang. Baogang has also launched a new situation of building a "small Baogang." This is a surprising and winning chess game, which can not only enable An'gang and Baogang to increase millions of tons of steel in a very short period of time, but also provide an example for all large enterprises in the country.

    钢帅的“一盘棋”
    千音
    谁都知道，鞍钢和包钢是我国目前已有和即将建成的现代化的最大的钢铁联合企业，现在它们布置了一局妙棋：
    鞍钢在今年年底以前，要兴建两百多座中小型高炉，五十多座中小型转炉。包钢要搞一个小包钢。在这样巨大的企业里，在大炉子旁边搞小炉子，大企业里面搞小企业，搞大中小相结合，这又是一个创举。
    在有些人看来，大型企业，设备是大型的现代化的，劳动组织、厂区布置、生产线路等等都是按大的架子布局的；既然一切皆大，只要充分发挥大的专长，就可以用高速度多出产品，毋需再搞大中小相结合了。可是事情未必如此，大企业搞中小设备，好处很多。首先大型企业家当大，底子厚，只要各方面稍稍紧一下，小小不言的设备，就可大批地成套地腾出来造出来；其次在原料方面，企业大，头头脑脑的“下脚”就不会少，这些，用大设备来处理也许不合算，而中小设备，却可以经济合理地使用这些原料；再次大型企业的技术力量是雄厚的，抽一批搞几个小生产单位，对原有生产是不会有影响的。更重要的是，大型企业有了大中小一套，跃进指标就可以插上翅膀，可以更多更快更好更省地发展生产力。
    如果不信，鞍钢包钢的事实可以使你相信。鞍钢二百多座中小型高炉和五十多座转炉的建设，所需要的设备材料90％以上是利用旧的，自己解决，不要国家拿钱。铁矿石也是用大炉子“吃”剩下来的。建筑力量也由原有的各厂矿分工包建。这真是一着多快好省的妙棋。
    本来么，大中小相结合，以中小为主，由小变大，这是一条既快且好的方法。当前的问题是要解放思想，要放下大厂的架子，不要觉得大企业搞小设备是件不光彩的事，思想障碍一扫除，干劲就起来了。
    不久以前，有些人怀疑：“投资省一半、产量翻一番，五年的事情三年完”，这只是鼓动口号。现在这方面的怀疑派是不多了，但是对老厂大企业办小高炉，在他们看来这还是个问号。现在，在大企业里面，搞“大中小兴旺”，搞“儿孙满堂”已经成为事实，而且效果很好，这个问号也可以取消了。
    在以钢为纲，全民抓钢的今天，为了用更快的速度多出钢铁，中共鞍山市委在鞍钢摆下了大中小相结合的一盘棋。包钢也铺开了办小包钢的新局面。这是一局出奇致胜的棋，它不仅可以在很短的时间里面，使鞍钢包钢增加成百万吨的钢铁，而且也为全国所有的大型企业提供了一个榜样。
