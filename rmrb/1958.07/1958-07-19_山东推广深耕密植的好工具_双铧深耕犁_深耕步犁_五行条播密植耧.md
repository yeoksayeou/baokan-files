Xinhua News Agency report: The Shandong Provincial Agricultural Tool Reform Committee recently decided to promote 400,000 double-share deep plowing plows and walking plows, and 300,000 five-row strip seeding dense planting drills throughout the province to meet the needs of deep plowing and dense planting for the autumn planting season.

Since the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the requirement to universally promote the experience of dense planting and deep plowing in this year's autumn planting, the Provincial Department of Agriculture, Department of Heavy Industry, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shandong Agricultural College, Agricultural Science Research Institute, and Jinan Agricultural Tool Factory jointly organized forces to carry out the work of reforming deep plowing plows and dense planting drills according to this instruction. After synthesizing the advantages of various types of deep plowing plows at home and abroad, the double-share deep plowing plow and the walking plow deep plowing plow were successfully designed. At the same time, based on the experience of high-yield wheat dense planting in 43 agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province, and drawing on the essence of the dense planting methods of each cooperative, a five-row strip seeding dense planting drill was successfully trial-produced. After testing and evaluation, these three agricultural tools have good results. The walking plow deep plowing plow can plow to a depth of eight inches to one foot. Using two strong animals or three average animals, it can plow four mu of land per day. The double-share deep plowing plow plows to the same depth. Using two strong animals, it can plow four to five mu of land per day. The five-row strip seeding dense planting drill can be used to sow various crops such as wheat, millet, corn, soybeans, and sorghum. When crops are sown using this drill, the land utilization rate can reach more than 80% based on the area occupied at harvest; and it can complete several tasks at once, such as making ridges, opening ditches, sowing seeds, and covering soil; it can also adjust the sowing amount, soil covering depth, and number of sowing rows according to needs to ensure even sowing. One medium-sized animal pulling the drill, with two people operating it, can make ridges and sow 25 to 30 mu of land per day. The work efficiency is more than twice as high as using old drills for sowing and old methods for making ridges.

    山东推广深耕密植的好工具
    双铧深耕犁·深耕步犁·五行条播密植耧
    据新华社讯　山东省农具改革委员会最近决定在全省推广双铧深耕犁和步犁四十万部、五行条播密植耧三十万部，以应秋种深耕密植的需要。
    自中共山东省委提出今年秋种中普遍推行密植、深耕经验的要求后，省农业厅、重工业厅、供销社、山东农学院、农业科学研究所和济南农具厂即根据这一指示共同组织力量，着手进行改制深耕犁和密植耧的工作。经过综合省内外各式深耕犁的优点，设计成功了双铧深耕犁和步犁深耕犁；同时，根据山东省四十三个农业社的小麦密植丰产经验，吸取各社密植方法的精华，试制成功了一种五行条播密植耧。经过试验鉴定，这三种农具效果良好。步犁深耕犁可深耕八寸到一尺，用两头壮畜或三头一般的牲畜，每天可耕地四亩。双铧深耕犁耕深相同，用两头壮畜每天能耕四至五亩地。五行条播密植耧，可用于播种小麦、谷子、玉米、大豆、高粱等各种作物。用这种耧播种的作物，按收获时占地面积计算，土地利用率可达80％以上；并能一次完成筑畦、开沟、播种和复土等几项工作；还可以根据需要调节播种量和复土深度、播种行数，保证匀播。一头中等牲口拉耧，两人掌握，一天可筑畦、播种二十五亩至三十亩，工作效率比用旧耧播种和旧法筑畦提高两倍以上。
