    The Emotions and Voices of the Era
    Feng Zi
    I watched three plays, large and small, by the Henan Province Yu Opera Troupe No. 3, namely "Chaoyang Ditch," "Liu Hulan," and "Let's Compare." After watching "Chaoyang Ditch" and "Liu Hulan," I discovered that the actress who played Hu Lanzi's grandmother was the same Ma Lin who played Yinhuan in "Chaoyang Ditch." People couldn't help but talk to each other about the actress's talent, as if they had discovered a relative. The audience loved the actress's performance art so much because the artist sang the voices and emotions of the era in the language of drama and the language of music. Gao Jie, who played Hu Lanzi's mother, also played Yinhuan's mother-in-law in "Chaoyang Ditch." They are both mothers, but the times they live in are different, their experiences are different, and the characters' thoughts and feelings must be different. But in the differences, there is a commonality, that is, they are both mothers of the working people, and their maternal love for their daughters and daughters-in-law is great and selfless.

    Gao Jie is an actress with extraordinary talent. She has a good voice, which is one of the essential conditions for an opera actress. More importantly, she has a foundation in life, she has strong emotions for the era, and she has the passion that an artist should have, so she can create the image of ordinary working women. And this ordinary working woman lives in an extraordinary era, she has a love for the new society, and a love for the Party and the leader. When she hears that her future daughter-in-law is going to be sent down to her village to work and temper herself, she is so happy that she doesn't know how to receive her; when her daughter-in-law has ideological problems and pretends to be sick, she feels sorry for her, thinking that she is overworked. The long passage of singing and dialogue under the lamp, exploring the sleeping Yinhuan, truly and vividly conveys the feelings of an ordinary working woman's love for the new society to the audience! The whole audience listened to her singing art in complete silence; and at this time, the emotions and voices of the era inspired and moved the audience.

    Similarly, when Hu Lanzi's mother arrived five minutes before she was about to be executed; at this moment of imminent life and death, the mother, who could not bear to part with her sixteen years of flesh and blood, was about to see her daughter suffer at the hands of the enemy. At this time, the mother's only wish was to protect her child, and even wanted to die in her daughter's place. The cruel reality told her that the enemies were beasts, and the mother's heart was torn into pieces. The mother's grief and indignation at this time were endless. Gao Jie's performance can truly be said to be a tear with every word, and a tear with every sentence! The audience was almost not watching a play, but participating in this heroic event.

    Of course, the success of individual character creation is inseparable from the artistic treatment of the entire performance. As far as the two major plays "Liu Hulan" and "Chaoyang Ditch" are concerned, the artistic creation has an extraordinarily touching power; that is the breath of labor, the breath of life, and the breath of revolution. The mass scenes of the two major plays are handled so vividly and powerfully, the rhythm of the play is very clear, and the overall tone of the performance is passionate. The artistic design of the last scene of "Chaoyang Ditch" seems to bring the audience to the labor site; these bold creations also strengthen the artistic effect.

    The small play "Let's Compare" is a vivid and bold creation. Today, the spirit of the working people who are building socialism is unparalleled in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The whole work is permeated with the pride of this era, and even the heroes in history share this pride. The whole play is full of optimistic romanticism. The cooperative experience of Yang Lanchun and Zhao Jieshen, who wrote this play, is also worthy of attention. One is an intellectual from a peasant background, and the other is an experienced opera writer. When the Yu Opera Troupe No. 3 went to the Ming Tombs for a consolation performance, the labor enthusiasm of the Ming Tombs construction site moved them, and this small play was immediately produced. The facts show that when writers go to the reality of life and to the struggle, they will definitely produce works worthy of our era. The success of this repertoire is worthy of attention and recommendation.

    时代的感情和声音
    凤子
    我看了河南省豫剧院三团大小三个戏，即“朝阳沟”、“刘胡兰”、“比比看”。看过“朝阳沟”和“刘胡兰”，发现饰演胡兰子的祖母的就是“朝阳沟”中饰演银环的马琳同志，人们像发现了自己的亲人一样，禁不住相互谈论着演员的才能。演员的表演艺术那样受到观众的喜爱，是因为演员艺术家们以戏剧的语言、音乐的语言演唱出了时代的声音和感情。饰演胡兰子母亲的高洁，也是“朝阳沟”中饰演银环的婆母，同样都是母亲，但所处的时代不同，遭遇不同，人物的思想感情自必不同。而在不同中却有一个共同处，那就是她们都是劳动人民的母亲，她们对女儿、对媳妇的母爱是伟大而无私的。
    高洁是一位有非凡才能的演员。她有好嗓子，这是歌剧演员不可缺的条件之一。更重要是她有生活的基础，她具有强烈的时代感情，她具有作为一个艺术家应该有的激情，因而她能创造出普通的劳动妇女的形象。而这个普通的劳动妇女却生活在一个不平凡的时代里，她具有对新社会的热爱，对党、对领袖的热爱。当她听说未过门的媳妇要下放到本村来劳动锻炼，便满心欢喜的不知如何接待才好；媳妇闹思想问题、装病，她心疼媳妇是累病了。灯下探视假睡的银环的一长段唱和道白，真实而生动地将一个普通劳动妇女对新社会热爱的感情传达给了观众！全场观众真是鸦雀无声地欣赏她的演唱艺术；也就在这个时候，时代的感情和声音启发着激动着观众们。
    同样，当胡兰子就义前五分钟，母亲来了；即将生离死别的这一时刻，割舍不得十六年骨肉之情的母亲，将要亲眼看到女儿遭受敌人的残暴毒手，这时候，母亲唯一的愿望是保护自己的孩子，甚至想代替女儿去死。残暴的现实告诉她，敌人是野兽，母亲的心被撕裂成一片片，母亲这时的悲愤是说不完也哭不尽的。高洁的表演真可说一句一啼、一字一泪！观众们几乎不是看戏，而是参与了这一壮烈的事件。
    当然，个别角色创造的成功和整个演出的艺术处理是分不开的。就“刘胡兰”“朝阳沟”两个大戏来说，艺术创造上有它异常感人的力量；这就是劳动的气息、生活的气息、革命的气息。两个大戏群众场面处理的那样生动，有力，戏的节奏感很明快，整个演出调子是激昂的。“朝阳沟”最后一场的艺术设计，像把观众带到劳动的现场中去了似的；这些大胆的创造，也就加强了艺术的效果。
    小戏“比比看”是生动而又大胆的创造，今天，建设社会主义的劳动人民的精神气概，是古今中外无可比拟的。整个作品渗透了这个时代的自豪感，连历史上的英雄们也分享到这个自豪，全剧充满了乐观的浪漫主义的情趣。写这个戏的杨兰春、赵借身的合作经验也是值得重视的。一位是农民出身的知识分子、一位是有经验的戏曲作家。当豫剧院三团到十三陵进行慰问演出，十三陵工地的劳动热情感动了他们，立即产生了这个小戏。事实说明作家们到生活实际中去，到斗争中去，一定会产生出无愧于我们这个时代的作品来的。这个剧目的成功是值得重视和推荐的。
