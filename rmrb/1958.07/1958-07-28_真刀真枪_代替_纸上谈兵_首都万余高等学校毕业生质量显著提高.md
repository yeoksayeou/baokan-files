Xinhua News Agency, July 27th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Jigong reported: This year, the quality of over 11,000 graduates from various universities and colleges in the capital is significantly higher than in the past. They are about to go to work on various construction fronts of the motherland.

These young people, who entered school in 1953 or 1954, have experienced a series of political movements while studying, especially the rectification, anti-rightist struggle, conscious ideological revolution, and various movements of combining education with production in the past year. At the same time, in learning, because politics took command and "redness" led "expertise," both their political quality and professional quality have greatly improved compared with previous graduates.

Among the graduates, engineering students account for about half. This year, the graduation designs of these students have undergone a major innovation in content and method, changing the "armchair strategizing" approach of designing for the sake of designing in the past. Students from the coal mining, mining machinery and electrical engineering, and mining construction majors of the Beijing Mining Institute cooperated with each other to undertake the design tasks of several mines for the Ministry of Coal Industry. The mining plans they designed have already been put into construction by the construction units. The students who designed the Zhubian No. 1 Mine were commended by the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry for their ability to conscientiously implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, saving the country investment. The graduation designs of the students in the Department of Water Conservancy of Tsinghua University were all carried out in conjunction with the design of eight reservoir projects in the suburbs of Beijing, such as Miyun and Sanjiadian. Therefore, this year's graduates have received comprehensive engineer training, improved their ability to work independently, and consolidated their learning results. At the same time, they also deeply realized that the Party's guidelines and policies must be implemented in the design, that it must proceed from reality and from production, and that it must rely on the masses and conduct in-depth investigations and research.

Many students in liberal arts, science, law, and agricultural sciences have also begun to undergo qualitative changes by breaking through the situation of circling around in old books and in laboratories. This year's graduates of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University made a "reversal" of the traditional views of the old professors on classical literature in the school's teaching reform movement. Twenty-six of them read 291 books in four or five days, collected a large amount of folk songs and folk literature materials from past dynasties, studied and analyzed them from the Marxist standpoint and viewpoint, and after nine debates with the teachers, finally overturned the old teaching syllabus that regarded the literature of the exploiting class as orthodox and established a new syllabus that regarded people's literature as orthodox. Students majoring in economics, trade, statistics, and law at the Renmin University of China studied Mao Zedong Thought on the one hand and went deep into factories, mines, and agricultural cooperatives on the other hand. By working with workers and peasants, their ideological feelings changed, and the quality of the investigation and research reports they made also greatly improved. Most of the graduates majoring in agronomy and plant protection at Beijing Agricultural University served as deputy captains of production teams in agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing this year. They can generally independently solve agricultural technical problems and are valued by the agricultural cooperatives.

This year's graduates, who are in the era of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the motherland, have learned the Party's general line for socialist construction, carried forward the communist style of daring to think and dare to act, broken down superstitions, and created more and more inventions. Xie Xingjian, a student in the Department of Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, boldly proposed a new plan during his graduation internship at the Fengman Hydropower Station, saving the factory a set of power generation equipment worth 700,000 yuan. The selenium photovoltaic cells and other five new products successfully trial-produced by this year's graduates of the Department of Physics of Peking University, and the spiral tube heat exchanger created by Su Meiquan, this year's graduate of Beijing Petroleum Institute, are considered by teachers to have reached the international level.

This year, after the great debate on the issue of redness and expertise, and the movement of confessing their hearts to the Party, this year's graduates have developed a strong atmosphere of comparing who is the reddest and who raises the red flag the highest. The slogan "Resolutely obey the state's allocation and go to the most difficult places" has been raised even louder. The erroneous views of "opening up a free market" put forward by a few students last year under the influence of the social rightists have been swept away. This year's graduates of Beijing Forestry College uttered such heroic words: "Let the green forest greet red communism, and let the heroic motherland be covered with a new green dress from this generation!"

### “真刀真枪”代替“纸上谈兵”  首都万余高等学校毕业生质量显著提高

    “真刀真枪”代替“纸上谈兵”
    首都万余高等学校毕业生质量显著提高
    新华社27日讯　新华社记者朱继功报道：今年首都各高等学校一万一千多名毕业生的质量比过去有显著提高，他们即将分赴祖国各个建设战线上工作。
    这些从1953年或1954年入学的青年，在学习的同时历经了一系列政治运动，特别是近一年来的整风、反右派斗争、自觉思想革命和教育同生产相结合的各项运动，同时在学习中由于政治挂了帅和以“红”带“专”，因而无论是政治质量或业务质量，他们都比以前历届毕业生有很大提高。
    在毕业生中，工科学生约占一半。今年，这些学生的毕业设计都一改过去为设计而设计的“纸上谈兵”式的作法，从内容上、方法上来了一个大革新。北京矿业学院采煤、矿山机电、矿山建筑各个专业学生互相配合，为煤炭工业部承担了几个矿的设计任务，他们设计的开矿方案已经由建设单位开始施工。设计竹边一矿的学生由于能认真贯彻多快好省的方针，为国家节省了投资，受到河北省工业厅的好评。清华大学水利系学生的毕业设计，全部是结合京郊密云、三家店等八个水库工程设计进行的。因此，今年毕业的学生们受到了全面的工程师训练，提高了独立工作能力，巩固了学习成果；同时也深切地体会到设计中必须贯彻党的方针、政策，必须从实际出发、从生产出发，必须依靠群众、深入调查研究等等。
    许多文、理、法、农科的学生由于冲破了在故纸堆中和在实验室里打圈子的局面，也开始起了质的变化。北京师范大学中文系本届毕业生，在学校教学改革运动中对老教授在古典文学方面的传统观点大做“翻案文章”，他们二十六人在四五天中看了二百九十一册书，收集了大量的历代民歌和民间文学资料，学习用马克思主义立场观点分析研究，经过同教师九次的辩论，终于推翻了以剥削阶级文学为正宗的旧教学大纲，建立了以人民文学为正宗的新大纲。中国人民大学有关经济、贸易、统计、法律等专业的学生一方面学习毛泽东思想，一方面深入到厂矿企业、农业社去，通过和工人、农民一起劳动，思想感情改变了，所作出的调查研究报告的质量也大有提高。北京农业大学的农学、植物保护两个专业的毕业生，今年大部分在京郊农业社担任了生产队副队长的工作，一般都能独立解决农业技术上的问题，受到农业社的重视。
    这届适逢祖国工农业生产大跃进时代的毕业生，很多学习了党的社会主义建设总路线以后，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，破除了迷信，创造发明日益增多。清华大学电机系学生谢行健在丰满水电厂作毕业实习时，大胆地提出一种新方案，为厂方节约了一套价值七十万元的发电设备。北京大学物理系本届毕业生试制成功的硒光电池等五种新产品，北京石油学院本届毕业生苏美全创造的螺绞管换热器，教师们都认为已达到了国际水平。
    今年，本届毕业生经过红专问题的大辩论，以及向党交心运动，比谁红得透，比谁的红旗插得高，已蔚然成风，“坚决服从国家分配，到最艰苦的地方去”的口号提得更加响亮了。去年少数学生在社会右派言论影响下提出的“开辟自由市场”的错误论调已经一扫而空。北京林学院本届毕业生说出了这样的豪言壮语：“要让绿色的森林迎接红色的共产主义，让英雄的祖国从这一代起披上绿色的新装！”
