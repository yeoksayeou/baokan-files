Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st - The small indigenous iron smelting furnaces and small indigenous steel smelting furnaces built by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee have successfully produced medium carbon steel and gray cast iron. The cadres of the Provincial Party Committee have also proposed four measures to maintain normal production.

These two indigenous furnaces were built by the staff of the Provincial Party Committee Office using old scrap materials. The steel furnace produces twelve to fourteen jin of steel per tapping, and the iron furnace produces about sixty jin of iron per tapping, with a daily output of over one thousand jin of iron. During the furnace construction process, Jiang Weiqing, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally went to the site late at night to provide guidance and encouragement. Provincial Party Committee Secretaries Hui Yuyu and Chen Guang also came to the construction site to encourage the comrades. Provincial Party Committee Secretary Xu Jiatun also gave many instructions while ill, which greatly encouraged the comrades.

In order to keep production going and produce more and better steel, the cadres of the Provincial Party Committee have formulated four measures based on the characteristics of the organization: First, the responsible comrades will continue to personally take charge, establish a smelting leadership organization, and assign specific personnel to be responsible; second, among all the staff of the General Office, continue to conduct in-depth ideological mobilization, making active participation in smelting a regular and glorious obligation, both as office staff and smelting workers, both mental and manual laborers; third, according to the production needs and the different physical strength of the staff, rationally organize male and female labor to participate in production in shifts; fourth, adopt methods such as on-site operational practice, visits, apprenticeship, and snowballing to actively cultivate and expand the technical team, so that every staff member can master certain steelmaking and ironmaking techniques and operate independently in a very short time.

    既是脑力劳动者  又是体力劳动者
    江苏省委机关干部炼钢炼铁
    新华社南京21日电  中共江苏省委机关自办的小土炼铁炉和小土炼钢炉已经成功地炼出了中炭钢和灰口铁。省委机关干部并提出了四条坚持正常生产的措施。
    这两座土炉子是省委办生产的工作人员利用旧废料砌成的。炼钢炉每次出钢十二市斤到十四市斤，炼铁炉每次约出铁六十市斤，一昼夜可出铁一千斤以上。在建炉过程中，省委第一书记江渭清同志深夜亲临现场指导和鼓励，省委书记惠浴宇、陈光同志也来工地对同志们进行勉励，省委书记许家屯同志在病中也作了多次指示，对同志们鼓舞很大。
    为了使生产坚持下去，炼出更多更好的钢铁，省委机关干部根据机关特点，订出了四条措施：第一，负责同志继续亲自挂帅，建立冶炼领导组织，确定专人负责；第二，在办公厅全体工作人员中，继续深入地进行思想动员，把积极参加冶炼作为一项经常的光荣的义务，既是机关工作人员，又是冶炼工人，既是脑力劳动者，又是体力劳动者；第三，按照生产需要和工作人员体力强弱的不同情况，合理地组织男女劳动力，轮班参加生产；第四，采取现场操作实习、参观、拜师傅、滚雪球等办法，积极地培养和壮大技术队伍，要使每个工作人员都能在很短时间内，掌握一定的炼钢、炼铁技术，进行独立操作。
