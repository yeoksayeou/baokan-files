    Wuxi Youth Technicians Create Bobbin Vertical Reeling Machine
    Silk Reeling Steps Halved
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch – A bobbin vertical reeling machine has recently been successfully trial-produced in Wuxi, reducing the silk reeling process from eight steps to four. It was jointly researched and trial-produced by young technicians Dan Zhendong, Chen Shixiu, and Zhang Moujie of the Wuxi Municipal Textile Research Institute.
    Shortening the silk reeling process is key to accelerating production and saving labor. This problem, which had been studied for a long time in Japan without a solution, has now been solved by China's young technicians.
    The bobbin vertical reeling machine completely eliminates the four processes of the back reeling section (re-winding, silk skeining, hank winding, and finishing), retaining only the four processes of the front reeling section (cocoon peeling, cocoon selection, cocoon boiling, and silk reeling).

    无锡青年技术员制成筒子立缫车
    缫丝工序省掉一半
    据新华社南京电　一种筒子立缫车最近在无锡试制成功，它把缫丝工序由八道减成四道。它是无锡市纺织研究所青年技术员单振东、陈士修、张谋洁等共同研究试制成功的。
    缩短缫丝工序是加速生产过程、节省劳动力的关键。这个在日本曾长期研究未能解决的课题，现在由我国的青年技术员解决了。
    筒子立缫车把后缫部分的四道工序（复摇、编丝、绞丝、整理）完全取消了，只保留前缫部分的四道工序（剥茧、选茧、煮茧、缫丝）。
