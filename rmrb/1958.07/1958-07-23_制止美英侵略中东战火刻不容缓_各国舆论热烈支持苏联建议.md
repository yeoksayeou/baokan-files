Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - Pyongyang newspapers today published editorials supporting the Soviet proposal to convene a five-nation summit, and demanded the swift cessation of armed aggression against the Middle East by US-British imperialists.

	"Labor News"'s editorial said that the armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by US-British imperialists has created the greatest danger not only to the Middle East but also to world peace. At this critical juncture, the Soviet government proposed a five-nation summit to resolve the issue and stop the aggression through peaceful negotiations. The Korean people, along with peace-loving people all over the world, warmly welcome and fully support this initiative.

	The editorial said that we are closely watching how the US-British ruling clique will treat this Soviet proposal. If the US-British imperialists reject this Soviet initiative once again, then they will not be able to escape full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom, and their true face as enemies of human peace will be exposed to the people of the world.

	"Democratic Korea News"'s editorial pointed out that the US-British aggressors are starting to play with fire in the Middle East. The only correct way to resolve the current situation is to immediately withdraw the invading forces from the Middle East and let the people of the region solve their own destiny. Therefore, we fully support the Soviet government's proposal to convene a five-nation summit.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - Newspapers in various Eastern European socialist countries have recently published commentaries on the Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev's proposal to convene a summit of major powers to stop US-British military intervention in the Middle East. The newspapers believe that this proposal is another proof of the Soviet Union's unremitting commitment to maintaining peace.

	Poland's "People's Tribune" wrote in its commentary on the Soviet proposal on the 21st that the situation in the Near East is very dangerous. For the first time since World War II, we are in a situation where the smallest spark could cause a fire that engulfs the world. The Soviet initiative is a great initiative to save peace at a time when peace is under terrible threat. The commentary said that all peace-loving people will believe that a negative response to the Soviet proposal is an unforgivable act.

	Bulgaria's "Workers' Affairs" also published an editorial on the 21st saying that the Soviet government's proposal once again proves the Soviet government's deep concern for world peace and the fate of mankind. The editorial sternly pointed out that the era in which colonialists wantonly trample and plunder the people of other countries is gone forever. The forces of world freedom and peace, based on the entire socialist camp, have surpassed the forces of imperialism and war in all aspects. When necessary, the forces of freedom and peace can inflict devastating blows on the aggressors.

	Romanian newspapers unanimously welcomed the Soviet proposal. "Spark"'s editorial on the 20th pointed out that US-British armed aggression against the Middle East poses a serious threat to world peace. The Soviet proposal expresses the Soviet Union's sense of responsibility for the fate of mankind and its firm determination for peace and to stop aggression.

	Hungary's "Hungarian National News" editorial on the 20th pointed out that the Soviet proposal is a new effort by the Soviet Union to eliminate the danger of war threatening mankind.

	Albania's "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 20th saying that the Albanian people warmly welcome the Soviet proposal and demand that the imperialists stop playing with fire and abandon their criminal plans in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 21st - "Al-Akhbar" published an editorial today saying that Khrushchev's recent proposal to convene a top-level meeting to discuss the Middle East issue is a reasonable proposal that provides an opportunity to save world peace.

	The newspaper said that the world believes it is a way to ease the current tension created by the United States.

	The newspaper said that the landing of US troops in Lebanon makes the United States responsible to world opinion for disrupting peace and leading the world to war. Therefore, the United States' current opposition to the Soviet proposal will be strongly condemned by the world.

	"Al-Ahram"'s editorial said that Khrushchev's proposal is a practical and feasible solution to the Middle East issue, and the newspaper expressed hope that Western countries will carefully consider this proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 21st - Damascus newspapers published the full text of Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev's letter to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India on the front page. The newspapers pointed out in their headlines that the Soviet peaceful initiative is to ensure the peace and security of the Arab East.

	"Al-Nour" commented on Khrushchev's letter today, saying that Khrushchev's letter has been fully approved and supported by the people of all countries, especially the Arab people, because agreeing to this letter will help maintain peace and save Lebanon and Jordan. The newspaper also said that Khrushchev's letter once again proves that this socialist country fully upholds peace and quickly and unreservedly strives to replace the language of force and weapons with the language of understanding and negotiation to resolve international differences, although it has far superior strength and weapons.

	"Al-Manar" said that Khrushchev treated the international situation with due attitude in the letter, and continued to discuss the issue of maintaining world peace from a proper perspective.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd - Indonesia's "People's Daily" wrote today that the Soviet proposal to hold a five-nation summit to stop the military conflict in the Middle East is a real way out. The Soviet proposal is in line with its identity as the vanguard of world peace.

	The newspaper called for strengthening the struggle to prevent war, supporting the Arab people's struggle against US-British aggression, and making every effort to ensure that the Soviet proposal can be quickly realized.

	"Dongxing Daily" also expressed support for the Soviet proposal. The newspaper said that although the Soviet Union has enormous military power to deal with the enemy without hesitation, it still proposes to convene a five-nation summit and proposes that Eastern and Western countries sign a treaty of friendship and cooperation; if the leaders of all countries can realize the people's desire for peace and do not have prejudices against the Soviet Union's peaceful proposal, the crisis in the Middle East can be quickly resolved.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - According to TASS Tokyo, 21st: Japanese public opinion warmly welcomes the Soviet proposal.

	Yasui Kaoru, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, told a TASS reporter that convening a five-nation summit at this moment when the fate of peace is at stake is appropriate and particularly necessary.

	On behalf of all Japanese people who oppose atomic war and fully support Khrushchev's proposal, Yasui Kaoru expressed hope that the leaders of the United States, Britain, and other countries will accept this proposal, and that they will take measures at this meeting to eliminate the serious crisis in the Middle East, thereby saving mankind from the danger of a third world war.

	"Yomiuri Shimbun" emphasized in its editorial published on the 21st that it is now necessary to seriously consider the issue of convening a top-level meeting. The newspaper pointed out that the situation in the Middle East has become threatening and may turn into a world war at any time. The newspaper said that Khrushchev's proposal is "one of the best ways to resolve the conflict."

	"Mainichi Shimbun" also supports convening a top-level meeting. The newspaper wrote in an editorial on the same day that every effort must now be made to ease the extremely dangerous situation in the Middle East. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜
    新华社平壤22日电  平壤各报今天发表社论支持苏联关于召开五国首脑会议的建议，并且要求迅速制止美英帝国主义者对中近东的武装侵略。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说，美英帝国主义者对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略，不仅对中近东而且对全世界和平造成了最大的危险。就在这样的紧急关头，苏联政府建议召开五国首脑会议，以和平谈判的方法来解决问题和制止侵略。朝鲜人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，热烈地欢迎和完全支持这一倡议。
    社论说，我们严密地注意美英统治集团将怎样对待苏联的这一建议，如果美英帝国主义者再一次拒绝苏联的这一倡议，那么他们将不能逃脱对由此而引起的后果负全部责任，他们的人类和平的敌人的面目将暴露在全世界人民面前。
      “民主朝鲜报”的社论指出，美英侵略者正在中近东开始玩火，在目前情况能够解决问题的唯一的正确的途径是使侵略军立即从中近东撤出，让这一地区人民自己来解决自己的命运。因此我们完全支持苏联政府关于召开五国首脑会议的建议。
    东欧各国
    新华社22日讯  东欧各社会主义国家的报纸，近两天纷纷就苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于召开大国政府首脑会议来制止美英在中近东的军事干涉行动的建议发表评论。各报认为，这个建议是苏联坚持不懈地维护和平的又一证明。
    波兰“人民论坛报”21日在评论苏联的建议时写道，近东的局势非常危险。第二次世界大战以后，我们第一次处在最小的火花都可能引起殃及全世界的大火的局势之下。苏联的倡议是在和平受到可怕威胁的关头拯救和平的伟大倡议。评论说，一切爱好和平的人都会认为，对苏联建议作否定的回答就是不可饶恕的行动。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”21日也发表社论说，苏联政府的这一建议再一次证明了苏联政府对世界和平和人类命运的深刻关怀。社论严正指出，殖民主义者为所欲为地蹂躏和劫掠他国人民的时代已经一去不复返了。以整个社会主义阵营为基础的世界自由和和平的力量已经在各方面超过了帝国主义和战争力量。必要时，自由和和平的力量能够给予侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    罗马尼亚各报一致欢迎苏联的建议。“火花报”20日的社论指出，美英对中近东的武装侵略使全世界和平受到严重威胁。苏联的建议表达了苏联对人类命运的负责精神，以及为和平和制止侵略的坚定决心。

    这家报纸说，全世界都认为它是使美国制造的目前紧张局势缓和的一个办法。
    报纸说，美军在黎巴嫩的登陆使得美国必须在世界舆论面前承担扰乱和平和把世界导向战争的责任。因此，美国在目前反对苏联的建议将要受到全世界强烈的指责。
    “金字塔报”的社论说，赫鲁晓夫的建议是解决中东问题的实际可行的办法，这家报纸表示希望西方国家慎重考虑这个建议。
    新华社大马士革21日电  大马士革各报都在第一版全文发表了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给美、英、法、印四国政府首脑的信。各报在标题中都指出，苏联的和平倡议是为了保障阿拉伯东方的和平和安全。
    “光明报”今天评论赫鲁晓夫的信件说，赫鲁晓夫的信件得到各国人民、特别是阿拉伯人民的完全赞同和支持，因为如果同意这封信，将有助于维护和平和拯救黎巴嫩和约旦。这家报纸又说，赫鲁晓夫的信件再一次证明，这个社会主义国家完全维护和平，并且迅速和毫无保留地努力争取以谅解和通过谈判解决国际分歧的语言来代替武力和武器的语言，虽然它拥有远居优势的力量和武器。
    “灯塔报”说，赫鲁晓夫在信件中以应有的态度对待国际局势，并且继续从正当的角度出发来讨论维护世界和平的问题。
    印度尼西亚
    新华社雅加达22日电  印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天写道，苏联提出的举行五国政府首脑会议以停止中东军事冲突的建议是一条真正的出路。苏联的建议是符合它作为世界和平的先锋的身份的。
    这家报纸呼吁加强防止战争的斗争、支援阿拉伯人民反对美英侵略的斗争，并且不遗余力地促使苏联的建议得以迅速实现。
    “东星报”也表示支持苏联的建议。这家报纸说，虽然苏联拥有足以毫不踌躇地对付敌人的巨大军事力量，但是，它仍然建议召开五国政府首脑会议，并且建议东方和西方之间签订友好合作条约；如果所有国家的领袖都能实现人民的和平愿望，对苏联的和平建议不存偏见，中东的危机就可以迅速解决。
    日本

    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁对塔斯社记者说，在目前这个攸关和平命运的时刻召开五国首脑会议是适宜的和特别必要的。
    安井郁代表反对原子战争、全面支持赫鲁晓夫建议的日本全体老百姓，表示希望美国、英国以及其它国家的领导人接受这项建议，并且希望他们在这次会议上采取措施，消除中近东的严重危机，从而拯救人类免于第三次世界大战的危险。
