    Gripping the Hammer Tightly to Strike the Aggressors
    ——On the Anger of Workers at the Chengdu Red Flag Iron Factory
    By Our Correspondent Zhou Zuyou
    Grip the hammer tightly in my hand,
    Shatter the dog legs that reach into Lebanon;
    If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade one step further,
    Lebanon will be a second Korea.
      ×××
    Grip the axe tightly in my hand,
    Chop off the devil’s claws invading Lebanon;
    If the U.S. imperialists dare to put chains on Lebanon again,
    The axe in my hand will never be lenient.
      ×××
    Grip the shovel tightly in my hand,
    Shovel away the smoke of war invading Lebanon;
    If the U.S. imperialists do not extinguish the torch of aggression,
    The Mediterranean will be your burial ground.
      ×××
    Burn the fierce fire in the furnace,
    Spew out the flames of justice;
    If the U.S. imperialists妄想妄想妄想妄想to invade Lebanon again,
    The flames will send you to the Western Paradise.

This is a poem written by Yu Runkui, a worker at the Chengdu Red Flag Iron Factory. He wrote the spirit of the Red Flag Iron Factory, no, the spirit of the entire Chinese working class, which is anger and passion against imperialist aggression.

These days, the Red Flag Iron Factory has set off a great leap forward in production. The workers are building the socialist motherland with soaring enthusiasm, but they have not forgotten the outside world. When the news of the armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by the U.S. and British imperialists came, the entire factory immediately boiled over, and every worker showed the will to extinguish the flames of imperialist aggression and defend world peace. Those who could draw quickly painted large-scale maps of the situation in Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan and posted them; those who could write immediately picked up their pens and created more than twenty anti-aggression poems in an hour and a half. The broadcasting station and blackboard newspaper spread the news of the anti-aggression struggle all day long. All the staff and workers of the factory held a rally to protest against the aggression by the U.S. and British imperialists, and various workshops and groups also held discussions. At these meetings, people not only resented the new acts of aggression by the imperialists, but also ignited the old hatred of those difficult days in their memories. Long Qinghe, an advanced producer in Sichuan Province and a middle-aged forge worker, is someone who suffered from the bullying of the U.S. imperialist army. When he was seventeen, he had built a military airport under the supervision of the U.S.-Chiang army. The punches and kicks of the American soldiers, the humiliation suffered by the sisters of the motherland, all kinds of scenes are still deeply engraved in his heart today. When he saw in the newspaper that the U.S. and British aggressor troops had actually committed acts of aggression again, he simply could not suppress the anger in his heart. He took every bit of free time from his tense production schedule to actively participate in various seminars and discussions, telling young workers about the dark years under the U.S.-Chiang rule, and calling on everyone to support the people of Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan with practical actions. He said: We are people who have suffered enough from imperialist enslavement and tasted all the hardships. We must not watch the Arab people suffer such hardships again. We are liberated workers, and we must help all the people of the world achieve independence and freedom. He led the forging team to formulate a guarantee, deciding to complete four innovations recently, including improving the air hammer conveying equipment and the cold bending angle iron machine, and strive to complete the July production plan ahead of schedule.

When participating in the parade in Chengdu, the workers in the second workshop of this factory wrote such sentences on the guarantee card they held high: "With the forging hammers in our hands, we can defeat any aggressive conspiracy." The workers all know that producing one more machine adds one more point of strength to defend peace. In two or three days, countless letters of support, protest letters, and guarantee letters were sent to the factory's Party committee and trade union. The fire of anti-aggression has further ignited the hot flames of the great leap forward in production. In the red light of the shining molten iron, in the thunderous roar of the forging hammer machine, the workers are working hard day and night. Over here, the workers gathered together to study the key issues in production, and there, they began to manufacture new tools. Almost every workshop and team has put forward new leap forward plans. One after another good news of technological innovation and increased production is constantly coming out from various workshops. The fourth workshop alone has completed five new technological innovations in the past two days. Since the 17th, the dozen or so workers in Li Kaijin's team have completed two technological innovations, increasing work efficiency by 40%, and are now conducting research on the third. The workers are reluctant to leave during meals and breaks. They said: To support the people of Lebanon and Iraq, one of us must work as hard as two!

    紧握铁锤打击侵略者
    ——记成都红旗铁工厂工人的愤怒
    本报记者  周祖佑
    握紧我手中的铁锤，
    打断伸进黎巴黎的狗腿；
    美帝胆敢再侵略一步，
    黎巴嫩就是第二个朝鲜。
      ×××
    握紧我手中的利斧，
    斩断侵略黎巴嫩的魔掌；
    美帝敢再把锁链套在黎巴嫩头上，
    我手中的利斧决不辜宽。
      ×××
    握紧我手中的铁铲，
    铲掉侵略黎巴嫩的烽烟；
    美帝若不把侵略的火把熄灭，
    地中海就是你葬身的墓园。
      ×××
    烧红炉中的烈火，
    喷射出正义的火焰；
    美帝再妄想侵略黎巴嫩，
    火焰会把你送上西天。
    这是成都市红旗铁工厂工人余润奎写的一首诗。他写出了红旗铁工厂，不，写出了整个中国工人阶级对帝国主义侵略的愤怒和激情。
    这些天，红旗铁工厂掀起了生产大跃进的热潮，工人们正以冲天的干劲建设着社会主义祖国，但是他们并没有忘记外面的世界。当美、英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩、约旦的消息传来以后，整个工厂立即沸腾起来了，每个工人都显示了扑灭帝国主义的侵略火焰、保卫世界和平的意志。能画的，赶绘出了大幅黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦形势图，张贴起来；能写的，立刻拿起笔杆，一小时半就创作出二十多首反侵略的诗歌。广播站和黑板报整天传布着反侵略斗争的消息。全厂职工举行了抗议美英帝国主义侵略的大会，各车间各小组也纷纷召开了讨论会。在这些会上，人们不仅愤恨帝国主义者新的侵略行为，而且在记忆中燃起了那苦难的往日的旧恨。四川省先进生产者、中年锻工龙清和，是遭受过美帝国主义军队欺凌的人。他十七岁时，曾经在美蒋军队监督下修筑军用机场。美国兵的拳打脚踢，祖国的同胞姐妹受到的污辱，种种景象，今天仍深深铭记在他心上。从报上看到美、英侵略军队居然又干下侵略罪行时，他简直无法抑制心头的愤怒。他抽出紧张生产中每一点空隙时间，积极参加各种座谈和讨论会，向青年工人讲述美蒋统治下黑暗岁月的情况，号召大家用实际行动支援黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦的人民。他说：我们是受够帝国主义奴役尝尽苦难的人，我们决不能眼看阿拉伯人民再遭受那样的苦难。我们是解放了的工人，我们一定要帮助全世界人民都得到独立和自由。他领导锻工小组制订了保证书，决定在最近完成改进汽锤输送设备、冷弯角铁机等四项革新任务，争取提前完成7月份生产计划。
    在参加成都市游行示威的时候，这个厂的第二车间工人在高举的保证牌上曾写着这样的语句：“凭我们双手掌握的锻锤，能够打垮任何侵略阴谋。”工人们都知道，多生产一部机器，就多增加一分保卫和平的力量。两三天中，无数的声援书、抗议书和保证书送到了工厂党委和工会里来。反侵略的怒火，更加燃红了生产大跃进的热焰。在铁水闪亮的红光中，在锻锤机雷鸣似的轰响里，工人们日日夜夜地紧张劳动着。这边，工人们围在一起研究着生产上的关键问题，那里，又开始制造新的工具。几乎每个车间和小组都提出了新的跃进计划。一项项革新技术、提高生产的喜报，不断从各个车间传出来。仅第四车间在最近两天中完成的革新技术的新创造就有五项。李开金小组的十来个工人，17日以来已完成两项技术革新，把工效提高40％，现在又进行着第三项的研究。吃饭和休息，工人们都不愿离开。他们说：要支援黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民，我们一个人干活得顶两个人！
