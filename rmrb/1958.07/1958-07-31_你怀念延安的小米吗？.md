Do you miss the millet of Yan'an?

Our reporter, Hu Jiwei

How many people miss the millet of Yan'an. With millet plus rifles, we relied on this material basis to defeat Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Millet nurtured our leaders and millions of revolutionary fighters. Millet made great contributions in the revolution. The people miss the millet of Yan'an. What is its situation now? Wheat has already shed the label of low-yield crop during the Great Leap Forward. Shouldn't millet also be given the title of high-yield crop? In the ranks of the people nationwide trying every means to achieve a bumper autumn harvest, are the people of Yan'an also striving for a bumper millet harvest?

People who have lived in Yan'an call both foxtail millet and broomcorn millet "millet." Are foxtail millet and broomcorn millet low-yield crops? In northern Shaanxi, the average yield of foxtail millet per mu is less than one hundred jin, and in many counties it is only about fifty jin. However, last year Yan'an County, under the disastrous conditions of spring cold, summer drought, and autumn frost, still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on 110,082 mu of foxtail millet, with an average yield of 121.9 jin, an increase of 38.5% compared to the previous year, exceeding the 111 jin target set by Shaanxi Province, and earning the honorary title of "Foxtail Millet Bumper Harvest County." Moreover, there were 8,633 mu of high-yield foxtail millet fields with yields ranging from 200 to 600 jin. The average yield per mu of large-scale high-yield experimental fields at the Yan'an Agricultural Experiment Station is also between 300 and 500 jin annually. Large-scale high-yield fields with yields of more than 400 jin exist in various counties of the Yan'an Special District. In 1956, the Xingguang Cooperative of Linzhen Township, Yan'an County, achieved a yield of 1,035 jin per mu on a 1.12 mu experimental field, winning the Golden Star Medal from the Ministry of Agriculture. The yield of broomcorn millet is generally higher than that of foxtail millet. In 1956, the Hongqi Cooperative in Ganguyi District, Yan'an County, also achieved a yield of 1,043.7 jin per mu on three mu of broomcorn millet. Last year, the Liping Cooperative in Ansai County, near Yan'an, achieved a yield of 1,087.2 jin per mu on two mu of broomcorn millet. In 1955, the Xinglong Cooperative in Xigu County, Gansu, also had a record of 1,037 jin of broomcorn millet per mu. The Soviet Union has a maximum record of 2,680 jin of foxtail millet and 2,760 jin of broomcorn millet per mu. Comrades, how can we say that foxtail millet and broomcorn millet are low-yield crops?

Why is the yield of millet generally very low? You should understand its situation. Under what difficult conditions does it grow! Because it is an excellent drought-resistant and cold-resistant variety, its main producing areas are in areas with cold climates, dry air, and scarce rainfall. Even in these areas, there is relatively good land, but it is not as delicate as other crops, which must have fertile soil and sufficient water. Therefore, people always leave the good land for rice, corn, and wheat, and always drive it (especially foxtail millet) to high mountain slopes and low-lying areas. There, soil erosion is serious, the land is thin, and people only apply three or two bags (about 100 jin per bag) of manure per year, or even no manure at all, and no watering. It is simply wishful thinking to increase production. Millet, like those cadres with excellent qualities, is assigned by the Party to the most difficult areas, and they still work hard with full confidence. Their work achievements may not seem very prominent from the abstract numerical indicators alone, but if you put yourself in their place and understand the difficulties they have experienced, you will be amazed and admire their greatness. Millet has this excellent character, this is the great Yan'an character!

Millet has always been the main grain of the people of northern Shaanxi. Taking the Yan'an Special District as an example, in 1957, rice accounted for 0.4% of the grain sown area and 1.5% of the total grain output; corn accounted for 9% of the area and 17% of the output; wheat accounted for 34% of the area and 28% of the output. It should be known that they are relatively "favored" in terms of land, fertilizer, water, and cultivation. But our heroic millet accounted for 26% of the grain sown area, but the grain output accounted for 32%. The total output and yield per mu of millet are increasing year by year, although the increase in numerical indicators is not large, it has always been a great contributor to the people of northern Shaanxi in building socialism.

The continuous release of high-yield "satellites" of wheat is a great encouragement to the people of Yan'an in striving for a bumper millet harvest. The struggle goal of the people of Yan'an County is to double the average yield per mu of millet this year compared to last year. In the entire Yan'an Special District, this year's foxtail millet and broomcorn millet have basically eliminated planting on hard stubble and the backward method of spreading manure, and the amount of fertilizer applied has been doubled compared to the past. They are now busy topdressing and weeding. Now many cooperatives in various counties have experimental fields with yields of 1,000 jin of foxtail millet and broomcorn millet. Last year, the Yan'an Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative suffered a disaster, but the 670 mu of foxtail millet still yielded more than 120 jin per mu, and the 550 mu of broomcorn millet yielded more than 160 jin per mu. The 24 mu of high-yield fields yielded 437.5 jin of foxtail millet per mu, and the 13.5 mu yielded more than 800 jin of broomcorn millet. This year, 736.5 mu of foxtail millet are expected to yield 339 jin per mu, and 552.1 mu of broomcorn millet are expected to yield 449 jin per mu. Combined, the yield of millet this year will cross the Yellow River at a rate of 200%. The Yan'an Xingguang Cooperative, which won the Golden Star Medal, plans to achieve a yield of 700 jin per mu on 100 mu of high-yield fields this autumn, with 2 mu reaching more than 1,500 jin. The Yan'an Prefectural Committee planted one mu of broomcorn millet experimental field in Qilipu, striving for a yield of 4,000 jin per mu. In Panlong District, which won the famous Panlong Victory during the Liberation War, the district cadres planted a 1.2 mu foxtail millet experimental field, originally planning for a yield of 5,000 jin per mu. Now, the foxtail millet seedlings have grown to nearly three chi high, about one chi taller than the foxtail millet seedlings planted at the same time nearby. The comrades' enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. They are determined to add more fuel and strive for a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. This will be a satellite in terms of millet. We wish this "Yan'an Millet" satellite a successful launch at the autumn harvest and congratulate them on another "Panlong Victory"!

Millet can achieve high-yields if given relatively good growing conditions. There are no low-yield varieties, only inferior farming methods. Let millet, which has a tradition of hard struggle, get good land, sufficient water and fertilizer, and get the careful cultivation of the people, and millet will surely make a Great Leap Forward! Let the people of Yan'an be able to obtain more abundant millet, and let people all over the country who miss the millet of Yan'an also be able to eat that yellow and fragrant Yan'an millet rice, which, as the local Shaanxi dialect says, is "beautiful beyond words"!

    你怀念延安的小米吗？
    本报记者　胡季委
    多少人怀念着延安的小米。小米加步枪，就靠这个物质基础，我们战胜了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。小米哺育过我们的领袖和千百万的革命战士。小米在革命中立过大功。人民怀念着延安的小米，它现在的情况怎样了呢？小麦在大跃进中已经摘掉了低产作物的帽子，小米是不是也应该换上高产作物的头衔呢？在全国人民千方百计争取秋田大丰收的行列里，延安的人民是不是也在争取小米大丰收呢？
    在延安住过的人，把谷子和糜子米统统叫作小米。谷子和糜子是不是低产作物呢？陕北地区谷子平均亩产不到一百斤，很多县仅仅在五十斤左右。但是去年延安县在春寒、伏旱、秋冻的多灾多难的条件下，十一万零八十二亩谷子，仍然得到了空前的丰收，平均产量达到一百二十一斤九两，比前年增产38.5％，超额完成陕西省提出的一百一十一斤的指标，得到“谷子丰产县”的光荣称号。而且还出现二百斤到六百斤的谷子高额丰产田八千六百三十三亩。延安农业试验站每年大面积丰产试验田平均亩产也在三百斤到五百斤之间。四百斤以上的大面积丰产田，在延安专区各县都有。1956年延安县的临镇星光社，一亩一分二试验田亩产一千零三十五斤，得到中央农业部的金星奖章。糜子比谷子的产量，一般都高一些，1956年延安县甘谷驿区的红旗社有三亩糜子也达到亩产一千零四十三点七斤。靠近延安的安塞县的黎平社二亩糜子去年亩产一千零八十七点二斤。1955年甘肃西固县兴隆社也有亩产糜子一千零三十七斤的纪录。苏联的谷子有亩产二千六百八十斤，糜子亩产二千七百六十斤的最高纪录。同志们，我们怎能说谷、糜是低产作物呢？
    小米的产量为什么一般是很低的呢？你应该了解它的处境，它是在多么艰苦的条件下生长着啊！因为它是一种抗旱耐寒的优良品种，它的主要产区都在气候寒冷、空气干燥、雨量稀少的地区。就在这些地区也有比较好的土地，但是它不像其他作物那样娇气，一定要肥饱水足的好地，因而人们总是把好地留给稻子、玉米和小麦，总是把它
  （特别是谷子）赶上高山坡洼。那里水土流失严重，土地瘦薄，人们一年只给上三两布袋（一袋百斤左右）粪，有的根本就不上粪，不浇水，增产那就根本是妄想了。小米，正像那些具有优良品质的干部一样，党把他们分配在最艰苦的地区，他们仍然信心百倍地努力工作。他们的工作成绩，仅仅从抽象的数字指标来看，似乎并不怎么突出，如果你设身处地去了解一下他们所经历的艰难困苦，你就会惊叹和钦佩他们的伟大。小米，正具有这种优秀的性格，这是伟大的延安性格！
    小米一直是陕北人民的主要粮食。拿延安专区来说，1957年水稻占粮食播种面积0.4％，产量占粮食总产量1.5％；玉米面积占9％，产量占17％；小麦面积占34％，产量占28％，要知道，它们在土地、肥料、水分、作务等方面都比较受“优待”；而我们英雄的小米，占粮食播种面积26％，但是粮食产量却占了32％。小米的总产量和亩产量都在逐年上升，虽然增长的数字指标并不大，却一直是陕北人民建设社会主义的大功臣。
    小麦不断放出高产“卫星”，对延安人民争取小米大丰收，是一个很大的鼓舞。延安县人民的奋斗目标，是使今年小米的平均亩产量比去年翻一番。在整个延安专区，今年的糜谷基本上消灭了硬槎下种，基本上消灭了落后的拿粪撒种，施肥量比过去增加一倍左右，现在正在忙着追肥和锄草。现在各县很多合作社都有谷糜千斤的试验田。延安东方红农业社，去年受灾，六百七十多亩谷子仍然亩产一百二十多斤，五百五十多亩糜子亩产一百六十多斤，二十四亩丰产田亩产谷子四百三十七点五斤，十三亩半亩产糜子八百斤以上。今年七百三十六点五亩谷子争取亩产三百三十九斤，五百五十二点一亩糜子争取亩产四百四十九斤，谷糜合一起算，今年小米亩产量就会以增长200％的速度一下跨过黄河。得过金星奖章的延安星光社，计划今秋一百亩丰产田亩产七百斤，其中二亩达到一千五百斤以上。延安地委在七里铺种了一亩糜子试验田，争取亩产四千斤。在解放战争时期得到过有名的蟠龙大捷的蟠龙区，区干部种了一亩二分谷子试验田，原计划亩产五千斤，现在，谷子苗长到快三尺高，比附近同时下种的谷子苗高一尺左右。同志们的干劲越来越高，他们决心再加一把油，争取亩产一万斤。这将是小米方面的一颗卫星，我们预祝这颗“延安小米号”的卫星到秋收时胜利上天，祝贺再一次的“蟠龙大捷”！
    小米能够高额丰产，只要给它比较好的生长条件。没有低产的品种，只有低劣的耕作方法。让有艰苦奋斗传统的小米得到良好的土地，充足的水和肥，得到人们精耕细作的抚育，小米一定能够大跃进！让延安人民能够获得更丰富的小米，而且让全国各地怀念着延安小米的人们，也能吃到那黄澄澄、香喷喷的延安小米饭，正像陕北土话说的，那就是“美得太太的”了！
