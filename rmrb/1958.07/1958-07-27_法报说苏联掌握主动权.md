Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Paris: Khrushchev's letters to the heads of government of the three Western powers and the Prime Minister of India have become the focus of attention in the Paris newspapers.

    Even some ultra-right-wing newspapers have had to admit that the diplomatic initiative is entirely in the hands of the Soviet Union. Many commentators believe that the Western countries will find it difficult to reject the Soviet Union's new proposals. "Combat" said that the news that the Soviet government agreed to hold a summit conference of heads of government in the Security Council "greatly surprised the Western countries." This newspaper believes that the Western countries "will find it very difficult" to oppose the participation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and some Arab leaders in this meeting.
      "Liberation" said: "Mr. Khrushchev's approval puts the Western countries in a difficult position."

    法报说苏联掌握主动权
    据新华社讯　赫鲁晓夫给三个西方国家政府首脑和印度总理的信件成为巴黎报纸注意的中心。
    甚至于一些极右翼的报纸也不得不承认，外交主动权完全掌握在苏联手里。许多评论员认为，西方国家将很难拒绝苏联的新建议。“战斗报”说，苏联政府同意在安全理事会召开政府首脑会议的消息，“使西方国家大吃一惊”。这家报纸认为，西方国家“将非常不容易”反对印度总理尼赫鲁以及某些阿拉伯国家领导人参加这次会议。
      “解放报”说：“赫鲁晓夫先生的赞同使西方国家处于困难境地。”
