Nanjing University, originally one of the earliest comprehensive universities in China, was founded in 1902. It was renamed several times in between, and was officially named Nanjing University after liberation. At the same time, it also began to acquire a new life, becoming a university of the people.

Nanjing University currently has ten departments, including Chinese Language and Literature, History, Foreign Languages, Biology, Geology, Geography, Meteorology, Mathematics and Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry. It offers twenty majors such as Chinese Language and Literature, History, Russian, English, German, French Language and Literature, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Geochemistry, Meteorology, Climatology, Physical Geography, Economic Geography, Cartography, Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, and Chemistry.

In the past few years, the school's basic construction has greatly developed, with newly built school buildings exceeding twice the amount before liberation. The school has a total of ninety-five laboratories and one million Chinese and foreign books.

There are currently 4,300 students, 512 teachers, and 270 staff members.

In the past academic year, through the rectification campaign, the socialist consciousness of teachers and students at Nanjing University has greatly improved. Now, a new upsurge of teaching reform is being launched, implementing the policy of opening to workers and peasants, serving politics, and serving production.

In the past six months, teachers and students of Nanjing University have also enthusiastically carried out the work-study movement. Each department has found three ways to implement work-study: The departments of Geology, Geography, and Biology mainly conduct field work; the departments of Mathematics and Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, and part of the Meteorology department mainly utilize laboratory equipment and cooperate with industrial departments to carry out industrial production; the three liberal arts departments and part of the Meteorology department mainly engage in agricultural and horticultural production. Practical activities for work-study have also been greatly developed. The three liberal arts departments have already opened farms, which are expected to reach 1,000 mu. Students from the Geology, Geography, and Biology departments have already gone or are about to go to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi and other provinces for field work. In terms of industrial production, more than a hundred kinds of products have been manufactured. Among them, the Maksutov telescope manufactured by the Astronomy major, the fiberglass, CZ rubber accelerator, and hydrogen peroxide manufactured by the Chemistry major, and the 5-60mA fuses and quartz microfilaments manufactured by the Physics major have all reached international standards. At the same time, the Physics department has preliminarily trial-produced Rochelle salt single crystals, and the moving-coil loudspeakers will soon be put into mass production. Teachers' scientific research has also shifted to serving politics and serving production. The science departments have established connections with relevant agencies.

Currently, Nanjing University has a new atmosphere. Under the leadership of the Party, all teachers and students of the school have established a leap-forward goal: to work hard for one year to lay the foundation, and to work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of the school.

    高歌猛进的南京大学
    南京大学原是国内最早的综合性大学之一。创办于1902年，中间数次更名，解放后，才正式命名为南京大学。同时，她也开始获得了新的生命，成为人民自己的大学。
    南京大学现有中国语文、历史、外国语文、生物、地质、地理、气象、数学天文、物理和化学等十个系，设有汉语言文学、历史、俄、英、德、法语言文学、动物学、植物学、地质学、地球化学、气象学、气候学、自然地理、经济地理学、地理制图学、数学、计算数学、天文学、物理学和化学等二十个专业。
    数年来，学校基本建设有很大发展，新建校舍超过解放前两倍。全校共有九十五个实验室，中外图书一百万册。
    现有在校学生四千三百人，教师五百一十二人，职工二百七十人。
    在过去的一个学年，南京大学通过整风，师生的社会主义觉悟大大提高，现在正掀起一个新的教学改革的高潮，贯彻向工农开门，为政治服务，为生产服务的方针。
    半年来南大师生也热烈开展勤工俭学运动，各系找到了实施勤工俭学的三条道路：地质、地理、生物三系，以进行野外工作为主；数学天文、物理、化学三系及气象系一部，以利用实验室设备，配合工业部门，进行工业生产为主；文科三系及气象一部，以进行农业、园艺生产为主。勤工俭学的实际活动也有了很大开展。文科三系已经开辟了农场，预计将达一千亩。地质、地理、生物各系同学已经或即将到江苏、浙江、福建、安徽、江西等省进行野外工作。在工业生产方面已经制成百余种产品。其中天文专业制造的马克苏托夫望远镜，化学专业制造的玻璃钢、CZ橡胶促进剂、双氧水、物理专业制造的5——↓60毫安的保险丝和石英微丝都已达到国际水平。同时，物理系初步试制成功了酒石酸钾钠单晶体及滚珠喇叭即将投入大批生产。教师的科学研究也转到为政治服务、为生产服务的方向。理科各系和有关机关都建立了联系。
    目前南京大学气象一新。全校师生在党的领导下，确立了一个跃进目标：苦干一年，打下基础，苦干三年，根本改变学校的面貌。（附图片）
