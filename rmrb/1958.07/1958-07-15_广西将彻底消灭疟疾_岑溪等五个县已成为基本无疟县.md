Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, July 14th: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is comprehensively launching work to completely eliminate malaria. Currently, over 90% of the region's counties have carried out malaria surveys and anti-relapse treatment. Cenxi, Yangshuo, Beiliu, Liucheng, and Donglan counties have achieved their Great Leap Forward plans ahead of schedule and have become basically malaria-free counties.

Malaria is one of Guangxi's major endemic diseases. In the past, during summer and autumn, the incidence rate among residents in high-malaria areas generally reached 30% to 40%, and in some areas even as high as 80% to 90%, which greatly affected agricultural production increases. In order to protect the people's health, rescue labor power, and thoroughly change the historical situation of "rice turns yellow, beds are full of disease," the autonomous region's anti-malaria work this year began as early as March and April. According to incomplete statistics from 20 counties including Daxin and Longsheng Autonomous Counties, two million people have been surveyed for malaria, and 150,000 people have received anti-relapse treatment. In counties like Cenxi, Yangshuo, and Liucheng, where malaria has been basically eliminated, the resident morbidity rate has dropped to about one in ten thousand, and the attendance rate of agricultural cooperative members has generally reached 90% to 100%, powerfully promoting the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

In the first half of this year, the large-scale "eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene" campaign in rural areas played a significant role in eliminating malaria. Cenxi County carried out six large-scale campaigns from February to mid-June, eliminating tens of thousands of catties of mosquitoes and mosquito larvae. Many rural areas eliminated foul-smelling ditches and stagnant ponds, and the weeds around houses were cleared away completely, providing extremely favorable conditions for eliminating malaria.

    广西将彻底消灭疟疾
    岑溪等五个县已成为基本无疟县
    据新华社南宁14日电　广西僮族自治区彻底消灭疟疾的工作全面展开。目前，全自治区90％以上的县都开展了疟疾普查和抗复发治疗；岑溪、阳朔、北流、柳城、东兰等五个县，已提前实现了跃进规划，成为基本无疟疾县。
    疟疾是广西主要的地方病之一。过去，每逢夏秋到来，高疟区居民发病率一般达30％至40％，少数地区竟高达80％至90％，对农业增产有极大的影响。为了保护人民健康，抢救劳动力，彻底改变历史上“稻谷黄、病满床”的状况，自治区今年的抗疟工作，早在3、4月间就开始了。现据大新、龙胜各族自治县等二十个县的不完全统计，经过疟疾普查的人数有二百万，其中有十五万人进行了抗复发治疗。岑溪、阳朔、柳城等基本消灭疟疾的县份，居民患病率已下降到万分之一左右，农业社社员出工率普遍达到90％至100％，有力地促进了农业生产大跃进。
    今年上半年，农村中的大规模除四害、讲卫生运动，对消灭疟疾起着巨大的作用。岑溪县从2月到6月中旬连续进行了六次大围攻，消灭蚊子、孑孓数万斤，许多农村消灭了臭水沟、死水塘，屋边杂草铲得干干净净，为消灭疟疾提供了极其有利的条件。
