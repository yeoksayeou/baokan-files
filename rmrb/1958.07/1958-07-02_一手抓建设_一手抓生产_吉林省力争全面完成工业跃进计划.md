This dispatch from Changchun on July 1st reports: While continuing to firmly grasp local industrial construction, Jilin Province has begun to reverse the trend of some enterprises neglecting production leadership, implementing both production and construction simultaneously, striving to seize the opportunity in the second half of the year to comprehensively fulfill the leap forward plan.

In the previous period, Jilin Province, adapting to the situation of the great development of local industry, consistently placed its leadership focus on new factory construction. From the province to the city, county, township, commune, and street, the entire party and all the people were mobilized to vigorously run industry. By the end of May, more than four thousand small factories and mines throughout the province had been completed and put into production. This is a major achievement in the development of local industry throughout the province. However, starting in late May, leaders at all levels discovered that many old factories had numerous problems that needed to be solved in the production leap forward. Although the industrial output value of five industrial cities including Changchun and Jilin from January to May increased by 35% compared with the same period last year, it still fell far short of the requirements of the leap forward plan. By the end of June, the above five cities are expected to only complete 35% of the annual state plan, and 30% of the leap forward plan.

The industrial leadership departments of Jilin Province believe that vigorously grasping the production and construction of raw material industries is the key to promoting the comprehensive development of local industrial production and construction throughout the province. According to the principle of "producing what is lacking," the province will build hundreds of small blast furnaces and some steelmaking and steel rolling factories in the second half of the year, which are expected to produce more than 100,000 tons of pig iron, tens of thousands of tons of steel and steel products. In the second half of the year, some machinery factories will also be newly built and renovated to enhance machining capabilities and produce equipment urgently needed for the development of local industries such as petroleum and chemical industries.

Regarding the completion of the annual production leap forward plan, some enterprise leaders have a blindly optimistic attitude. They believe that after the new enterprises are put into production in the second half of the year, they will definitely be able to complete the annual task. Therefore, they have not seriously arranged how to further develop production in the original enterprises. A few factory leaders also believe that this year's leap forward plan is too high and cannot be completed, and they have already willingly "admitted defeat." Some people even asked the leadership to revise this year's production plan and lower the targets. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the leading organs of Changchun, Jilin and other cities are inspecting the rectification and production of various factories and mines, criticizing various conservative ideas, and urging all units to "implement" production measures in accordance with the spirit of the general line. The Jilin Machinery Factory found in a major production inspection that the production situation of the factory in March, April and May deteriorated month by month, mainly because the leadership had a blindly complacent and relaxed attitude. For example, some workshop cadres have a "wait and see" mentality, and do not hold a production meeting even once a month, and the factory leaders do not correct this situation and relax leadership. Now, in the major production inspection, the workers in all workshops and departments of the factory have determined the direction of technological innovation, put forward new measures, and strived to fully complete the red flag competition of the leap forward plan. The Changchun Automobile Parts Factory had already overfulfilled its plan from January to May, but the task for the second half of the year is still very heavy, and some cadres lack confidence in completing the annual task. Recently, the workers posted more than two hundred big-character posters during the inspection, sharply criticizing this conservative ideology, and put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, further tapping into many production potentials.

### 一手抓建设　一手抓生产  吉林省力争全面完成工业跃进计划

    一手抓建设　一手抓生产
    吉林省力争全面完成工业跃进计划
    本报长春1日电　吉林省在继续抓紧地方工业建设工作的同时，开始扭转部分企业放松领导生产的偏向，使生产、建设双管齐下，力争抓住下半年的时机全面完成跃进计划。
    前一时期，吉林省适应地方工业大发展的形势，一直把领导重点放在新厂建设方面。从省到市、县、乡、社、街，发动全党全民大办工业。到5月底，全省已有四千多个小型厂矿建成并投入生产。这是全省地方工业发展中的一项重大成就。但是从5月下旬开始，各级领导发现不少老厂在生产跃进中存在许多问题需要解决。长春、吉林等五个工业城市，1到5月份的工业产值虽然比去年同期增长35％，但是距离跃进计划的要求还相差很远。到6月底，上述五个市预计仅能完成全年国家计划35％，完成跃进计划30％。
    吉林省工业领导部门认为：大力抓紧原材料工业的生产建设，是促进全省地方工业生产和建设全面发展的关键。根据“缺什么，生产什么”的原则，全省下半年将建设几百个小型炼铁炉和一些炼钢、轧钢工厂，预计可生产十万多吨生铁，几万吨钢和钢材。下半年还将新建和改建部分机械厂，增强机械加工能力，生产石油、化工等发展地方工业急需的设备。
    对于完成全年生产跃进计划，有些企业的领导人员存在着盲目乐观情绪。他们认为下半年新企业投入生产以后，一定能完成全年任务，因而对原有企业如何进一步发展生产没有认真地加以安排。也有少数工厂的领导人员认为今年的跃进计划订得过高，无法完成，已经甘心“认输”。有的人甚至要求领导方面修改今年的生产计划，降低指标。中共吉林省委和长春、吉林等市的领导机关正在根据总路线的精神，重点检查各厂矿的整风和生产情况，批判各种保守思想，督促各单位生产措施“落实”。吉林机械厂在生产大检查中发现，这个厂3、4、5月份生产情况逐月转坏，主要是因为领导方面存在着盲目自满和松劲情绪。如有的车间干部存在着“观潮”思想，一个月也不召开一次生产会议，而厂的领导干部对这种情况不加纠正，放松了领导。现在，全厂各车间、科室的职工在生产大检查中确定了技术革新的方向，提出了新的措施，争取全面完成跃进计划的红旗竞赛开展起来了。长春汽车配件厂1到5月份已经超额完成了计划，但是下半年任务仍然很重，有些干部对完成全年任务信心不足。最近，职工在检查中贴出了二百多张大字报，尖锐批评了这种保守思想，并且提出了大量合理化建议，进一步挖掘出许多生产潜力。
