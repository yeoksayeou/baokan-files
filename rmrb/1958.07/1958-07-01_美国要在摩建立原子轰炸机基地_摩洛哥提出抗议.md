Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Rabat: The Moroccan government lodged a protest with the United States on the 29th against the US decision to transform its air base in Nouasseur (fifteen miles south of Casablanca) into an atomic bomber base.

The US decision was announced on the 28th. According to the decision, from July 1st, the Nouasseur Air Base will be transferred to the Strategic Air Command and become an operational base under the command of another US air base in Spain.

Moroccan government officials expressed surprise that the United States made this decision without notifying the Moroccan government, and pointed out that the United States made this decision at a time when Morocco was considering demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory.

The United States has a total of five air bases in Morocco.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th dispatch: Tunisian Foreign Minister Sadok Mokaddem told reporters from the Middle East News Agency on the 29th that Tunisia will never give up Bizerte. French troops can only stay in Bizerte for a period of time, the duration of which will be stipulated in a separate agreement between the two countries in the future.

He also said that Tunisia would never allow Bizerte to be used for war against Algeria. At the same time, Tunisia has no intention of concluding a military treaty with France.

    美国要在摩建立原子轰炸机基地
    摩洛哥提出抗议
    据新华社30日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥政府29日向美国提出抗议，反对美国决定把它在努瓦塞（卡萨布兰卡以南十五英里）的空军基地变成为一个原子轰炸机基地。
    美国的这个决定是在28日宣布的，根据这个决定，从7月1日起，努瓦塞空军基地将改隶于战略空军司令部，变成作战基地，受设在西班牙的另一个美国空军基地指挥。
    摩洛哥政府人士对美国没有通知摩洛哥政府就作出这一决定表示惊异，并且指出，在美国作出这个决定的时候，正是摩洛哥在考虑要求从它的领土上撤退所有外国军队的时候。
    美国在摩洛哥一共有五个空军基地。
    据新华社开罗29日电　突尼斯外交部长萨多克·莫卡德姆29日对中东通讯社记者发表谈话说，突尼斯决不放弃比塞大。法国军队只能在比塞大停留一个时期，停留的期限将在以后由两国在另外的协定中规定。
    他还说，突尼斯决不让比塞大被用来对阿尔及利亚进行战争。同时，突尼斯也无意同法国缔结军事条约。
