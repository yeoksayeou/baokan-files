Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has broken with conventional inpatient treatment methods, adopting short-course treatments, door-to-door treatments, and other measures to greatly accelerate the eradication of schistosomiasis. Currently, six counties, including Le'an, Huanjiang, Hechi, the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County, the Bama Yao Autonomous County, and Pingguo, have basically eradicated schistosomiasis.

According to statistics from relevant departments, the entire autonomous region treated more than 11,000 patients from January to the end of June. In May alone, more than 4,400 patients were treated, equivalent to the total number of patients treated in the entire region last year. In the six counties where schistosomiasis has been basically eliminated, snails have also been largely eliminated, more than 95% of patients have received effective treatment, and necessary inspections and management of feces and water sources have been carried out. Land that was previously abandoned due to loss of labor from the disease has now been restored to cultivation. The health of the people has been steadily improving.

After studying the General Line, many medical workers criticized conservative ideas, broke superstitions, and further corrected their attitude of serving the people, thereby carrying out treatment work quickly, well, and economically. The entire autonomous region originally had 28 prevention and treatment stations, which were adjusted and expanded to 118. The number of staff at each station was reduced from the original 10 to 40 people to 3 to 5 people. They also thoroughly broke with the outdated practice of long-term hospitalization, simplified treatment procedures, comprehensively promoted three-day and two-day short-course treatments, and implemented and established a variety of methods and systems such as door-to-door treatment, nighttime treatment, resident-in-commune treatment, and resident-in-school treatment. This not only made it more convenient for patients but also saved expenses, bringing about an unprecedented rapid situation in the treatment of schistosomiasis.

In eliminating snails and managing feces and water sources, various localities have also broken with old practices. For example, in the past, when using fire or chemical sprays to kill snails, the soil was not turned over, and the turf was not completely removed, so the snails hidden under the topsoil could not be completely eliminated. Now, various localities are universally combining water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, digging new ditches, filling old ditches, or removing sludge from ditches and channels, and removing turf beside ditches, then spraying chemicals and setting fires to kill the snails, making snail eradication work both fast and effective.

    解放生产力　荒地变乐土
    广西加速消灭血吸虫病工作
    新华社南宁16日电　广西僮族自治区打破住院治疗常规，采用短程治疗和上门治疗等多种办法，使消灭血吸虫病的速度大大加快。现在，乐兰、环江、河池、大苗山苗族自治县、巴马瑶族自治县和平果等六个县，已基本消灭了血吸虫病。
    据有关部门统计，全自治区1月到6月底，共治疗一万一千多名病人，其中5月份一个月就治疗了四千四百多名病人，相当于去年全区全年治疗人数的总和。在已经基本消灭血吸虫病的六个县里，都基本消灭了钉螺，95％以上的患者得到了有效的治疗，粪便和水源都进行了必要的检查和管理。过去因患病丧失劳动力而荒弃的土地，现在已恢复种植。人民群众的健康状况日益增强。
    许多医务工作人员在学习总路线以后，批判了保守思想，破除迷信，进一步端正了为人民服务的态度，因此多快好省地展开治疗工作。全自治区原有二十八个防治点，经过调整扩大到一百一十八个，每个防治点的工作人员由原来的十至四十人减少到三至五人，并且彻底破除长期住院治疗的陈规，简化治疗手续，全面推行三日和两日短程疗法，实行和建立上门治疗、夜间治疗、驻社治疗、驻校治疗等多种多样的办法和制度，既方便了病人，又节约了开支，使血吸虫病的治疗工作出现前所未有的快速局面。
    在消灭钉螺和管理粪便和水源方面，各地也打破了老一套的做法。例如过去用火烧或用化学药品喷杀钉螺时，不翻土，不铲净草皮，因此隐在表土下面的钉螺不能彻底灭除。现在，各地普遍结合兴修水利和积肥运动，挖新沟、填旧沟，或清除水沟污泥，铲除渠沟旁边草皮，然后喷洒药水、引火烧杀，使灭螺工作做到了又快又好。
