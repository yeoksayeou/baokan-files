Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 30th July: Newspapers here reported today that a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon publicly announced on the 29th that U.S. troops would occupy Lebanon for a long time. He said that U.S. troops would only withdraw from Lebanon when the Lebanese and U.S. governments, and the United Nations, requested them to leave.

The spokesman's remarks inadvertently revealed the true intention of the United States to occupy Lebanon for a long time. He indicated that reaching an agreement on the Lebanese presidential election issue alone would not mean that U.S. troops would withdraw. He also said that U.S. troops would only withdraw after the United Nations provided "sufficient guarantees" for Lebanon's independence and "domestic security was re-established" in Lebanon. This exposes the lie spread by Murphy that the U.S. invading forces in Lebanon would withdraw after the Lebanese presidential election.

It is revealed that the U.S. aggressor troops are prepared to "adopt a tougher approach" to threaten the Lebanese people if the Lebanese opposition "cannot accept" the new president chosen by the United States and "serious disputes occur."

Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Sami es-Solh put pressure on the Army Commander-in-Chief and presidential candidate, Fuad Chehab, on the 29th, urging him to deploy the army to intensify the armed suppression of the rebel forces on the eve of the presidential election, and to restore so-called "law and order" before the election day, so as to facilitate the Chamoun group's control of the election.

The military pressure exerted by the Chamoun group on the opposition in coordination with the presidential election campaign is intensifying. On the 29th, government troops and rebel forces engaged in fierce fighting near the government headquarters, post office building, and main squares in Beirut. The government troops in the city center sent several armored vehicle patrols to the vicinity of the Basta district controlled by the rebel forces, firing as they proceeded.

### 美国驻黎大使馆公然宣布  要长期侵占黎巴嫩

    美国驻黎大使馆公然宣布
    要长期侵占黎巴嫩
    据新华社大马士革30日电　这里的报纸今天报道，美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆发言人在29日公开宣布美军要长期占领黎巴嫩。他说，只有在黎巴嫩和美国政府以及联合国要求美国军队撤走时，美军才撤出黎巴嫩。
    这个发言人的谈话不打自招地暴露了美国想长期侵占黎巴嫩的真正企图。他表示，仅仅在黎巴嫩总统选举问题上取得一致意见，将不意味着美军将要撤出。他还说，要到联合国对黎巴嫩的独立“提供足够的保证”，并且“黎巴嫩国内安全重新建立起来”以后，美国军队才会撤出黎巴嫩。这就揭穿了墨菲所散布的侵黎美军在黎巴嫩举行总统选举以后就将撤出的谎言。
    据透露，美国侵略军已经准备在一旦黎巴嫩反对派“不能接受”美国所挑选的新总统而“发生严重纠纷”时，“采取更强硬的方针”来威胁黎巴嫩人民。
    同时，黎巴嫩总理索勒哈在29日向陆军总司令、总统候选人谢哈布施加压力，要他出动陆军在总统选举前夕加紧武装镇压起义部队，在选举日前恢复所谓“法律和秩序”，以便于夏蒙集团控制选举。
    夏蒙集团为了配合总统选举活动而向反对派施加的军事压力正在加紧。29日，政府军和起义部队在贝鲁特市内政府总部、邮局大楼和主要广场附近爆发了激烈的战斗。市中心的政府军派了好几辆装甲车巡逻队到起义部队控制的巴斯塔区的周围去，他们一面行进一面射击。（附图片）
