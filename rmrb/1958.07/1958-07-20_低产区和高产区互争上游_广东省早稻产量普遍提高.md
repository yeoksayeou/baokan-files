    Low-Yielding Areas and High-Yielding Areas Compete to be the Best
    Guangdong Province Achieves Universal Increase in Early Rice Yields

    (Our dispatch) The early rice crop in Guangdong Province has been mostly harvested. Amidst the bumper harvest, it has been discovered that a large number of previously lower-yielding areas and previously higher-yielding areas are progressing side by side, competing to be the best.

    Last year, the highest early rice yield in Guangdong was in the Chao-Shan Plain region, averaging over 400 jin per mu. Other plain areas and mountainous regions generally yielded around 300 jin per mu, while hilly areas only yielded 100 to 200 jin. This year's early rice harvest shows that not only has the already high-yielding Chao-Shan Plain achieved even higher yields, breaking the 500 jin per mu barrier for early rice, but other plain areas and mountainous regions are also catching up rapidly. For example, Panyu and Shunde in the Pearl River Delta, Lianping and Heping in the eastern Guangdong mountains, and Lianxian and Xinfeng in the northern Guangdong mountains have all exceeded 400 jin or broken through 500 jin per mu this year, keeping pace with the counties of the Chao-Shan Plain. Panyu County's record of 550 jin per mu of early rice even surpasses the Chao-Shan Plain, becoming the county with the highest early rice yield in the province.

    As a result of the large number of backward areas catching up, the imbalance in grain production across the province has been greatly changed. Among the seven special districts, one administrative district, and one province-administered city in the province, only Shantou Special District had an early rice yield exceeding 300 jin per mu last year. This year, not only has Shantou Special District broken through 400 jin per mu, but Foshan, Shaoguan, and Gaoyao Special Districts, as well as Guangzhou City, have also broken through 400 jin per mu. Among the 118 counties (cities) in the province, only eight had early rice yields above 400 jin per mu last year, but this year the number has increased to more than 50. Last year, 80 had yields below 300 jin per mu, but this year only more than 20 remain below 300 jin per mu.

    Going all out, aiming high, thoroughly shattering the shackles of right-leaning conservative thought of "regional backwardness theory" and "condition theory," and resolutely overcoming obstacles in water, fertilizer, soil, and technological reform are the fundamental factors for these areas transforming from backward to advanced and from low-yielding to high-yielding. For example, Xuwen County, known for "nine droughts in ten years" and "red land for thousands of miles," has its largest river with a flow of only 0.8 cubic meters per second. Although the annual rainfall is 1,100 millimeters (800 millimeters in dry years), the evaporation rate is 1,700 millimeters. Therefore, more than half of the county's 160,000 mu of paddy fields use the backward farming systems of broadcasting seeds and *tian (sowing two crops of rice seeds at once). After the establishment of cooperatives in 1956, the county decided to build four reservoirs, but proponents of the "condition theory" opposed it, saying, "Xuwen has little rain and a high evaporation rate. Building reservoirs is just a waste of manpower and resources." As a result, only two small reservoirs were completed in eight months, irrigating a total of 2,000 mu of land. Last winter, the county committee used the fact that these two reservoirs guaranteed a bumper harvest as teaching material, shattered the arguments of the "condition theory" proponents, mobilized the masses, and worked hard for 100 days to complete more than 1,900 water conservancy projects benefiting a total of 250,000 mu, laying the foundation for this year's great leap forward. During the spring plowing, the county committee decided to change the farming system of broadcasting seeds and *tian, but some agricultural cooperatives used the old method and broadcast 500,000 jin of inferior seeds. Proponents of the "condition theory" also put forward four reasons why the system "cannot be changed," saying: fields along waterways cannot be changed because of water flow, deep fields cannot be changed because of water depth, fields near streams cannot be changed because they are afraid of flooding, and drought-stricken fields cannot be changed because of lack of water. The county committee promptly proposed four solutions: waterways can be ditched, deep fields can be filled with soil, high embankments can be built around streams, and water conservancy can be built for drought-stricken fields. They launched a resolute struggle with the "condition theory" proponents and mobilized the masses to resolutely plow under the 500,000 jin of inferior seeds through great debates, thereby achieving a great victory in early rice production.

    From June 27th to July 7th, heavy rains fell across Henan Province, with most areas receiving 200 to 300 millimeters of rainfall, and some areas receiving more than 500 millimeters. Thanks to the large-scale water conservancy projects built in Henan Province last winter and this spring, no floods occurred during this flood season. The picture shows a glimpse of fish-scale pits in the mountainous area of Yu County.

### 低产区和高产区互争上游  广东省早稻产量普遍提高

    低产区和高产区互争上游
    广东省早稻产量普遍提高
    本报讯　广东省的早稻绝大部分已经收割完了，丰收中发现，大批原来比较低产的地区和原来比较高产的地区齐头并进，竞争上游。
    广东去年早稻的产量，以潮汕平原地区最高，平均亩产四百多斤；其他平原地区和山区一般三百斤左右；丘陵地区只有一两百斤。今年早稻收获的结果，不仅原来比较高产的潮汕平原出现了更高产的局面，突破了早稻亩产五百斤的大关，其他平原地区和山区也直赶而前。如珠江三角洲的番禺、顺德，粤东山区的连平、和平，粤北山区的连县、新丰等县，今年早稻的产量，都越过四百斤、突破五百斤，和潮汕平原各县并驾齐驱。番禺县早稻亩产五百五十斤的纪录，更超过潮汕平原，成为目前全省早稻产量最高的一个县。
    大批落后地区赶上来的结果，全省粮食生产的不平衡状况有了极大的改变。在全省七个专区、一个行政区和一个省属市中，去年早稻亩产量超过三百斤的，只有一个汕头专区，今年不仅汕头专区突破了每亩四百斤，佛山、韶关、高要三个专区和广州市，同样突破了每亩四百斤。在全省一百一十八个县（市）中，去年早稻每亩四百斤以上的只有八个，今年增加到五十多个；去年每亩三百斤以下的有八十个，今年每亩三百斤以下的只剩二十多个。
    鼓足干劲，力争上游，彻底粉碎“地区落后论”和“条件论”的右倾保守思想的束缚，坚决攻破水、肥、土和技术改革关，是这些地区落后变先进、低产变高产的根本因素。如“十年九旱”“赤地千里”的徐闻县，全县最大的河流才只有零点八个流量，年雨量虽有一千一百公厘（旱时八百公厘），蒸发量却有一千七百公厘；因此全县十六万亩水田，半数以上是采用撒种和?田（一次播下两造谷种）的落后耕作制度。1956年合作化后，县里决定修四个水库，“条件论”者就反对说：“徐闻下雨少，蒸发量大，修水库只是劳民伤财。”结果八个月时间只修成了两个小水库，共灌溉二千亩地。去年冬天，县委利用这两个水库保证了丰收的事实作教材，粉碎了“条件论”者的论调，发动了群众，苦战一百天修成了受益共二十五万亩的水利一千九百多宗，奠定了今年跃进的基础。春耕时，县委决定改变撒种和?田的耕作制度，可是有些农业社却采用旧办法撒下了劣种五十万斤。“条件论”者并提出四个“不能改”的理由来反对，他们说：水路田因过水不能改，深入田因水深不能改，溪边田因怕水浸不能改，受旱田因缺水不能改。县委又及时提出四个办法：水路田可以开沟，深入田可以加土，溪边田可以修高基围，受旱田可以修水利，和“条件论”者展开了坚决的斗争，并发动群众通过大辩论把撒下的五十万斤劣种坚决犁掉，从而取得早造的伟大胜利。（附图片）
    河南省自6月27日到7月7日全省各地普降大雨，降雨量大部分在二百公厘到三百公厘，有的地区降到五百多公厘。由于河南省去冬今春大兴水利工程，这次汛期到来没有出现水灾。图为禹县山区鱼鳞坑一瞥。
