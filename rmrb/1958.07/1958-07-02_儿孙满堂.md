	I hadn't been out for four or five days. I went out for a walk early this morning, but Secretary Han from Anshan Iron and Steel and a few others grabbed me and dragged me into the car, driving away without explanation. I complained to them, "I have other things to do. What are you going to Lingshan for?" Little Han said, "To see the offspring." I asked, "Cows or horses?" The technician from the steelmaking plant chuckled, "It's an old clam dropping bright pearls. Little Han is going to be a midwife, look how eager he is." Director Jiang added, "Calling them pearls is quite apt. The General Line strings these big and small pearls together, hanging them around the necks of 600 million giants, making our motherland shine!" I knew they were deliberately keeping it a "secret" from me, so I didn't ask any more questions and was happy to enjoy the scenery along the way.

	The sky was clear, with a strange lace trimming the fish-white horizon. It wasn't a jagged mountain range, but a row of majestic blast furnaces, one after another towering chimneys, high-voltage power lines, and cranes rising straight into the clouds connected together. -- These huge gray-black machines and buildings, set against the fish-white sky, formed such a beautiful and novel pattern. During the twenty-odd li journey from Anshan to Lingshan, I tried my best to admire the magnificent scenery of the steel city. In an instant, we arrived at the ore field. Here was another fresh sight: a group of black, red, and earth-colored hills. The young technician again said in a poetic tone, "These people who move mountains and fill seas have moved the iron mountains of Hainan Island, Pangjiabao, and Qidaogou here." The car suddenly stopped at a construction site. This construction site was unlike the ones we were familiar with, without excavators, cranes, or pulley horses; only shovels, earth baskets, and the working hands of the people. Little Han pointed and said, "This is a thrifty construction site." We got out of the car and saw an unexpected scene. I couldn't help but exclaim, "Iron is coming out!" "Small blast furnace!"

	At this time, Director Jiang proudly introduced, "That's right, this is an indigenous blast furnace. The first indigenous blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel, built in three days. The materials used are waste refractory bricks from the refractory plant. Only these two iron hoops and iron pipes cost more than thirty yuan, and the rest is just a little labor." Little Han pointed to the construction site and said, "Most of these 'workers' are company staff supporting the construction of the small blast furnace, and only five workers from the furnace building company were hired to provide guidance." Director Jiang continued to introduce, "Here, all the coke and ore that leaked from the large blast furnace are used, picking up scraps. The pig iron produced is mainly used to cast ball grinding iron for the sintering plant and can also be sold. This small blast furnace has already produced five tons of iron; the second and third will be officially put into production today."

	What we saw just now was the tapping of iron from the No. 2 small blast furnace. The fourth one is under construction, and it is said that the later ones will be much larger than this. After listening to their introduction, I went among the workers and asked a few of them. None of them had ever smelted iron, and none of them had ever seen such an indigenous blast furnace. However, the energy displayed on their faces made me see the joy in their hearts, their unwavering confidence, and their soaring enthusiasm. The most interesting thing is the foreman here, who is an old driver who has been driving for twenty years. In the past two years, he has been in charge of the mechanical section of the ore field. Now he has been ordered to manage these blast furnaces. He is so happy that he has become younger, studying with joy all day long, like a young man. Before and after the No. 1 small blast furnace tapped iron, he guarded it for five days and five nights, unwilling to go home.

	Just as I was talking enthusiastically with the workers, the old hero Meng Tai arrived. As soon as he arrived, he affectionately looked around the small blast furnace. Strangely enough, Meng Tai is an old pipe fitter, but when he came, everyone felt as if a huge blast furnace was standing in front of them. Many people gathered around him to ask questions. Old Meng Tai smiled and said, "This, I'm still a layman!"

	Then he brought up an interesting story: When he was invited to the Soviet Union for recuperation the year before last, a metallurgist there heard that he was a factory director of Anshan Iron and Steel (at that time, Meng Tai was the director of the No. 2 Repair Shop affiliated to the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant). The scientist wanted to meet him and asked him what China used to smelt iron before the invention of the blast furnace? Meng Tai honestly told him that he had only seen the blast furnace (blowing furnace) of Anshan Iron and Steel, and that he was a pipe fitter. Later, he told the scientist how he protected the factory after liberation, and how much Anshan Iron and Steel had developed with the help of the Soviet Union. The scientist listened and shook his hand repeatedly. Speaking of this, Meng Tai happily laughed and said, "If I see that scientist again now, I will tell him that in addition to the blast furnace, there is also the indigenous blast furnace; I will also tell him that the General Line of our Party Central Committee can bring into play and utilize all potentials and all methods to accelerate socialist construction." Everyone laughed happily at his words. I looked up and saw a red paper posted in front of the small dispatch room. I walked over and saw that it was a congratulatory message written by Yuan Zhen, the general manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, for the birth of the first small blast furnace, "Surpassing England":
		Don't look at my small blast furnace,
		Don't laugh at me,
		I implement the General Line,
		Walking on the broad road.

	This short poem, written by the person in charge of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which currently accounts for more than half of the country's steel production, is particularly meaningful. To be honest, before the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, I, like many comrades, did not have a thorough understanding of the simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises. Next to that congratulatory message was a banner presented by the Yingchao Iron Industry Cooperative of Yangcheng, Shanxi Province, to Anshan Iron and Steel's "Surpassing England" blast furnace. Upon inquiring, there was also a story behind it. It turned out that Anshan Iron and Steel had sent people to Yangcheng, Shanxi, to learn indigenous iron smelting techniques some time ago. The cooperative members there were very excited and immediately sent veteran worker Yuan Fenglin to Anshan Iron and Steel to assist. In this way, the modern large enterprise was combined with the indigenous industry. How great is the power of the General Line, it has mobilized all forces at once, allowing the entire China to leap forward a great distance. Now, not reading the newspaper for a day or not going out for two days will make people lag behind. At this time, I thanked Little Han and the others for pulling me here.

	I was thinking about many fresh and inspiring things in my mind when they had finished their work and were anxious to go back. It was a long time after getting in the car that I exclaimed, "Hey, you were clamoring to see the offspring, but you forgot about it." Little Han smiled and said, "Aren't those small blast furnaces the offspring of Anshan Iron and Steel?" I suddenly realized. Director Jiang then took the opportunity to add that Gongchangling was preparing to build several blast furnaces using indigenous methods, with a volume more than ten times larger than that of the "Surpassing England" blast furnace, and that Dagushan, Dong'anshan, and Yingtaoyuan were all building indigenous blast furnaces; the copper smelting plant was preparing to add converters to make steel, and the seamless steel pipe plant, medium plate, thin plate, and other plants were preparing to add steel rolling workshops (all done without investment or an increase in personnel). They all added to the story, one sentence after another, becoming more and more enthusiastic. I asked anxiously, "Then, how much steel can these medium and small blast furnaces and converters produce in total?" Little Han, as usual, kept it a "secret" from me, only smiling and saying, "Like father, like son -- however much the large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces produce, they will produce as much."

	The huge silhouette of the row of blast furnaces appeared in front of us again, and the construction site of Anshan Iron and Steel's largest modern blast furnace, which was just breaking ground today, was also in front of us. I couldn't help but silently pray: "Anshan Iron and Steel, I wish you a full house of children and grandchildren, prosperity in large, medium, and small enterprises!"

    儿孙满堂
    草明
    四五天没出门，今天一早到外头转转，却给鞍钢的韩秘书几个人一把拖我上车，不由分说地把车开走。我抱怨他们说：“我还有别的事呢，你们上灵山干什么呀？”小韩说：“看下仔去。”我问道：“是奶牛还是骡马？”其中那个炼铁厂的技术员笑嘻嘻地说：“是老蚌下明珠哩。小韩去当接生婆去呀，看他那个积极劲儿。”姜处长接着说：“比作明珠倒也恰当，总路线把这些大小明珠串起来，挂在六亿巨人的脖子上，使我们祖国闪闪发光！”我知道他们存心向我“保密”，也不再问，乐得看看沿路的风景。
    天空晴朗，鱼白色的天边镶了一道奇异的花边。那不是犬牙形的山峰，而是由一排雄伟的高炉，一个接一个的高耸的烟囱，高压线架子，和直上云霄的塔式吊车等连结而成的。——这些巨大的灰黑色的机械和建筑，衬在鱼白色的天幕下，却成为如此美丽新奇的图案了。汽车从鞍山到灵山的二十来里地的疾驰中，我尽量观赏钢铁城市雄伟的景色。转瞬到了矿石场。这儿又是一番新鲜的景象，这儿是一群黑色、红色、土色的丘陵。那位年青的技术员又用吟诗般的口吻说：“这些移山填海的人把海南岛、庞家堡、七道沟的铁山搬到这儿来了。”汽车突然在一片工地上停下来。这片工地不像我们熟悉的工地，没有挖土机、没有吊车、没有轱辘马；只有铁锹、挑土筐和人们的劳动的双手。小韩指点着说：“这是勤俭的工地。”我们下了车，便看到了一个意想不到的情景。我不禁惊呼道：“出铁！”“小高炉！”
    这时姜处长才得意地介绍道：“对啦，这是土高炉。鞍钢头一个土高炉，三天修成，材料是利用耐火厂不要的耐火砖，只这两道铁?和铁管花三十多元钱，其余就是费点人工罢了”。小韩往工地一指说：“这些‘工人’多半是公司的工作人员来支援小高炉的建设的，只请了五个筑炉公司的工人来指导。”姜处长又继续介绍说：“这里全是利用大高炉筛漏下来的焦炭和矿石，拣个零碎就有了。生产出来的生铁主要铸造球磨铁，供烧结厂用外还可外销，这个小高炉已出了五吨铁；第二、第三个今天正式投入生产。”
    刚才我们看见的，正是二号小高炉出铁。工地正在修第四个，据说以后的都比这大许多。我听完他们的介绍，就钻到工人中去问了几个工人，他们没有一个是炼过铁的，也没有一个是看过这样的土高炉的。可是他们脸上显现出来的那股劲儿，却使我看见了他们心中的高兴和不可动摇的信心与冲天的干劲。最有意思是这儿的工段长，他是个开了二十年汽车的老司机，近二年管矿石场的机械工段，现在奉命来管这些高炉，他高兴得变年青了，整天喜孳孳地钻研，像个小伙子。第一号小高炉出铁前后，他竟五天五夜地守着它，不肯回家。
    正和工人们谈得带劲时，老英雄孟泰来了。他一来就亲切地绕着小高炉东瞅西瞅。说也奇怪，孟泰是个老配管工，但是他来了，大家都觉得好像是一座巨大的高炉屹立在面前似地。许多人围过来向他问长问短。老孟泰笑着说：“这个，我还是个外行呢！”
    跟着他提起了一段有趣的故事：他前年应邀去苏联休养时，那儿的一位冶金科学家听说他是鞍钢的一位厂长（那时孟泰是鞍钢炼铁厂附属的修理二场的场长），便要和他见面，并问起他中国有鼓风炉以前用什么炼铁的？孟泰老实告诉他，他只看见过鞍钢的高炉（鼓风炉），而且他是个配管工。后来他把解放后他如何保护工厂，和鞍钢在苏联的帮助下有多大的发展说了一遍。科学家听了连连和他握手。说到这，孟泰快活地笑着道：“要是我现在再看到那位科学家，我就会告诉他除了鼓风炉以外，还有土高炉；我还要告诉他，我们党中央的总路线把一切潜力一切办法都能发挥和利用起来，加速社会主义的建设。”他这一说，大家都快活地笑了。我抬眼一望，小调度室前面贴了一张红纸，走前一看，原来是鞍钢总经理袁振为第一个小高炉“超英号”的诞生而写的祝词：
      别看我高炉小，
      不怕你们笑，
      我贯彻总路线，
      走的是阳关道。
    这首短诗出自一个生产钢铁目前占全国半数以上的鞍钢公司的负责人的手笔，是特别有意义的。老实说，“八大”二次会议以前，我也跟许多同志一样，对于大、中、小并举的认识并不透澈。在那祝词旁边，还挂了山西阳城应朝铁工业合作社给鞍钢“超英号”的赠旗。一打听，里面也有一段故事。原来鞍钢早些时候就派人去山西阳城学习土法炼铁，那儿的合作社员们很兴奋，立刻派了老工人原凤林前来鞍钢协助。这样，现代化的大企业也就和土法工业结合了。总路线的力量有多大啊，一下子就把所有的力量都调动起来，使整个中国大大跃进了好远。现在，一天不看报，两天不出门都会使人落伍的。这时我才感谢小韩他们把我拉来。
    我脑子里正想着许多新鲜的令人振奋的事，他们已办完了事，急着要回去。上了车好久，我才失声问他们道：“唉，你们嚷着去看下仔，到底把它忘了。”小韩笑着说：“那些小高炉不是鞍钢的仔么？”我听了恍然大悟。姜处长便又趁机补充介绍说弓长岭准备用土法修几个高炉，容积比“超英号”大十几倍的，大孤山、东鞍山、樱桃园都修土高炉；炼铜厂准备加修转炉炼钢，无缝钢管厂中型、薄板等厂准备加修轧钢车间（都是在不用投资，不增加人的情况下进行）。他们几个人你一句我一句，越补充越多，越说越热烈。我急着问道：“那么，这些中、小高炉、转炉统共能增产多少钢铁？”小韩照例又向我“保密”，只笑着说：“老子英雄儿好汉呗——大高炉、平炉出多少，它们就出多少。”
    那排高炉的巨大身影又在我们眼前出现了，那个鞍钢最大的现代化高炉今天正好破土兴工，那工地也在眼前呈现了。我不禁默默祝祷着：“鞍钢呀，祝你儿孙满堂，大、中、小兴旺！”
