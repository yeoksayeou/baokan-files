Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: A reading movement to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works is vigorously unfolding among youth from all circles in the capital.

Over the past month, various reading organizations such as "Mao Zedong's Works Study Groups," "Mao Zedong's Philosophy Research Groups," and "Red Flag Reading Clubs" have sprung up like mushrooms after rain among youth in many factories, mines, enterprises, schools, government offices, and rural areas in Beijing. Comrade Mao Zedong's works are giving young people wisdom and the power of the Great Leap Forward. Many people are simultaneously studying and connecting their studies with practical problems, improving their work, and raising their thinking.

Institutions of higher education and secondary specialized schools in the capital have already established more than 2,100 political theory study groups centered on studying Chairman Mao's works. Young teachers and students at Beijing Normal University, during the learning process, worked with older teachers to compile 150,000 words of "Comrade Mao Zedong's Psychological Thought," 120,000 words of "Comrade Mao Zedong's Educational Thought," and other works. Students in Class 1 of the third grade of the Chinese Department of this school, who previously called themselves a "typical mid-level class," analyzed the "mid-level" thinking in the class after studying the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They also improved the relationship between class leaders and classmates through rectification. Therefore, when the General Party Branch of the Chinese Department announced the teaching reform plan, the students, in a reversal of their past somber state, wrote big-character posters to offer suggestions and ideas. Students from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Beijing University of Political Science and Law, Beijing Medical College, and other schools are also studying important issues in the economic, political, and artistic fields in conjunction with their study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

Youth in rural suburbs and factory and mining enterprises are more closely connecting the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's works with actual production. The two study groups composed of fifteen young members of the first and second production teams of the Changzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Zhoukoudian District, use rest time while working in the fields and evenings for self-study, and hold a collective discussion once a week. They have a deep understanding of what Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Introducing a Cooperative": "The most remarkable feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. This seems like a bad thing, but in fact it is a good thing. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution." They immediately took action and formed a "Rocket Youth Shock Brigade" to work on experimental fields. After studying the article "Introducing a Cooperative," the members of the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company believed that Chairman Mao spoke from their hearts. In their discussions, they believed that in order to transform from poor to rich, they should accelerate the speed of construction and run ahead as quickly as possible. The members of this shock brigade have now generally mastered several technologies such as electric welding, scaffolding, and concrete pouring. After studying Chairman Mao's articles, young steelworkers such as Wang Xizhu of the Second Construction Site of an engineering company of the People's Liberation Army, built a story of a building in eight and a half days and invented more than 200 tools in more than 20 days, more than 70 of which have begun to be used.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League recently issued a decision on launching a reading movement to study Chairman Mao's works. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League will award Red Flag Reading Medals to learning organizations or individuals with better learning attitudes and results.

    从毛泽东同志著作中汲取跃进的力量
    首都各界青年展开学习毛主席著作的读书运动
    新华社13日讯　一个学习毛泽东同志著作的读书运动，正在首都各界青年中蓬勃展开。
    近一个月来，“毛主席著作学习小组”、“毛主席哲学研究小组”、“红旗读书会”等各种读书组织像雨后春笋一样，在北京许多厂矿、企业、学校、机关和农村的青年中不断出现。毛泽东同志的著作给青年们以智慧和跃进的力量，许多人一面学习一面联系实际问题，改进工作，提高思想。
    首都的高等学校和中等专业学校已经成立了以学习毛主席著作为中心的二千一百多个政治理论学习小组。北京师范大学的青年教师和学生在学习过程中，同老教师一起编写出十五万字的“毛泽东同志的心理学思想”、十二万字的“毛泽东同志的教育思想”等著作。这个学校中文系三年级一班学生以前自称是“典型的中游班”，在学习了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”文章以后，对班上的“中游”思想作了分析，并且通过整风改善了班干部和同学们的关系，因此，当中文系党总支公布了教学改革方案以后，同学们就一反过去沉闷的状态，纷纷写大字报献计献策。中国人民大学、北京大学、北京政法学院、北京医学院等校的学生也正在结合学习毛泽东同志的著作研究经济、政治、文艺各个领域中的一些重要问题。
    郊区农村和厂矿企业的青年们，更多地联系生产实际来领会毛泽东同志著作的精神。周口店区常庄农业生产合作社第一、第二生产队的十五名青年社员组成的两个学习小组，利用在地里干活休息的时间和晚间进行自学，周末集中讨论一次。他们对毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”的文章中所说的“中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。”体会很深，马上动手组成了“火箭青年突击队”搞试验田。北京市第三建筑工程公司张百发青年突击队队员们在学习了“介绍一个合作社”文章后，认为毛主席说出了他们的心里话。他们在讨论中认为：为了由穷变富，就应该加速建设速度，尽快地跑在前头，这个突击队的队员现在已经普遍掌握了电焊、绑脚手架、打混凝土等几种技术。解放军某工程公司第二工地王锡铸等青年钢筋工，学习了毛主席的文章以后，八天半盖了一层大楼，二十多天发明创造了二百多件工具，其中有七十多件已开始使用。
    共青团北京市委员会最近发出了关于开展学习毛主席著作读书运动的决定。对于学习态度和成绩较好的学习组织或个人，共青团北京市委将奖给红旗读书奖章。
