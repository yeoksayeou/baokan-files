According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the number of pigs raised nationwide in the second quarter has reached over 184 million, an increase of 26.4% compared to the end of 1957, exceeding this year's national plan by 22.9%.

From a national perspective, the number of pigs raised in all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities has increased compared to last year. Among them, Shanghai has the fastest growth rate, increasing by 145.6% compared to 1957, and Guangdong Province increased by 62.8%. Guizhou, Henan, Sichuan, Shanxi provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have growth rates of over 30%.

Calculated by the average number of pigs raised per household, the national average is 1.49 pigs per household, which basically meets the requirement of 1.5 to 2 pigs per household by 1962 as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have reached an average of 1.5 to 2 pigs per household; Shanghai, Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces and cities have reached 2 to 4.32 pigs per household. Furthermore, according to incomplete statistics from eighteen provinces and cities, more than one hundred counties have reached or exceeded the requirement of 2.5 to 3 pigs per household by 1967 as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

A prominent feature of the rapid development of pig production this year is the rapid development of collective pig raising. Henan Province now has more than 53,000 collective pig farms, more than double the number last year, raising a total of more than 3.25 million pigs, accounting for a quarter of the province's total pig population. In Hebei Province, the number of collectively raised pigs accounts for 15%-20% of the total number of pigs, more than double the number in 1957; Renxian County, which has the highest proportion of collectively raised pigs, accounts for 66.4%.

In Hunan Province, the proportion of collectively raised pigs has also increased from 5% last year to 16%; in Hengyang Prefecture, the number of agricultural cooperatives raising pigs collectively has increased from 1,463 last year to 6,269, and the number of collectively raised pigs has increased by more than five and a half times; by the end of May, the number of collectively raised pigs in Wangcheng County accounted for about 50% of the total number of pigs raised. In Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui Province, 120 agricultural cooperatives have established 3,457 pig farms, raising more than 300,000 pigs. (Attached picture)

According to her experiment, bathing pigs with baking soda can make each piglet gain half a kilogram of meat per day (piglets that are not bathed gain 450 grams of meat per day).

    全国养猪达一亿八千万头
    每一农户平均有猪一头半基本上达到农业纲要1962年要求
    本报讯　据农业部统计，全国第二季度养猪数量已达一亿八千四百多万头，较1957年底增加26.4％，超过今年国家计划22.9％。
    从全国的情况来看，各省（区）、市养猪数量都比去年增加。其中增加速度最快的上海市较1957年增加145.6％，广东省增加62.8％。增加速度在30％以上的有贵州、河南、四川、山西四省和内蒙古自治区、广西僮族自治区。
    如果按农户平均养猪头数计算，全国每一农户平均养猪一点四九头，基本上达到了农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定1962年每户平均养猪一点五到二头的要求。每一农户平均养猪达到一点五至二头的有广东、江西、湖南、福建、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁等省和广西僮族自治区；达到二至四点三二头的有上海市、安徽、四川、云南、贵州等五个省、市。又据十八个省市的不完全统计，有一百多个县达到或超过农业发展纲要（修正草案）1967年每户平均养猪二点五到三头的要求。
    今年生猪生产飞跃发展中的特点是集体养猪发展很快。河南省现有集体养猪场五万三千多个，比去年增加二倍多，共养猪三百二十五万多头，占全省养猪总数的四分之一。河北省集体养猪数量占猪总数的15％—20％，较1957年增加一倍以上；其中集体养猪比重最大的任县占66.4％。
    湖南省集体养猪也由去年的5％上升到16％；其中衡阳专区集体养猪的社由去年的一千四百六十三个增加到六千二百六十九个，集体养猪数量增加五倍半；望城县5月底集体养猪数量占养猪总数的50％左右。安徽省阜阳专区已有一百二十个农业社建立了三千四百五十七个养猪场，养猪三十多万头。（附图片）
