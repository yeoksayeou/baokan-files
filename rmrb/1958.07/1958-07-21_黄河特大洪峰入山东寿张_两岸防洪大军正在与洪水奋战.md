    Yellow River's Extraordinary Flood Peak Enters Shouzhang, Shandong
    Anti-Flood Army on Both Banks Battles the Flood
    (Our report) The anti-flood army on both banks of the Yellow River above Dongping Lake in Shandong Province is battling the extraordinary flood. The Yellow River flood peak passed the Sunkou Station in Shouzhang County at 12:00 on the 20th and is advancing towards Aishan Station in Dongping Lake.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: The extraordinary flood peak of the Yellow River has entered Shandong.
    At 4:30 AM on the 19th, when the flood peak passed Gaocun Station in Dongming County, the water level exceeded the guaranteed water level by 0.28 meters, reaching 62.96 meters, and the flow rate reached 16,600 cubic meters per second. After the flood peak passed, the water level slightly decreased. By 5:00 PM, the water level at Gaocun Station was 62.78 meters, and the flow rate was 15,100 cubic meters per second. The flood peak is now advancing towards Sunkou Station in Shouzhang County, Shandong Province. The water level at Sunkou Station is rising rapidly. At 7:00 PM, the water level was 48.25 meters, and by 9:00 PM, it had risen to 48.48 meters, with a flow rate of 11,500 cubic meters per second. The water level at Sunkou Station is still rising.
    The river channel in the Shandong section is narrower than that in the Henan section, and the flood control forces on the dikes have been strengthened.
    The anti-flood army on both banks of the Henan section is still engaged in a continuous battle with the flood, without relaxing their vigilance. After this extraordinary flood peak passed Huayuankou, the water level dropped very slowly, and the flow rate at Huayuankou remained at around 10,000 cubic meters per second for a long time (yesterday's report stated it had dropped to 7,000 cubic meters per second). The water level remained at a high level of over 93 meters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 19th: After the Yellow River's extraordinary flood peak entered the Heze County section of Shandong Province, the river channel in this section gradually narrowed. In addition, the previous flood peak has not been completely discharged, which may cause a prolonged period of high water levels. Therefore, although the extraordinary flood peak has left Henan, the water level has not dropped significantly, and the flood control army in Henan is still guarding the dikes closely.

    黄河特大洪峰入山东寿张
    两岸防洪大军正在与洪水奋战
    本报讯  山东省东平湖以上黄河两岸的防洪大军正在和特大洪水作斗争。黄河洪峰在20日十二时已经过了寿张县的孙口站，正向东平湖艾山站推进。
    据新华社19日讯  黄河的特大洪峰已经进入山东。
    19日上午四时三十分，洪峰经过东明县高村站时，水位超过保证水位零点二八公尺达六十二点九六公尺，流量达一万六千六百秒公方。洪峰过去后水势微落，到十七时，高村站水位为六十二点七八公尺，流量为一万五千一百秒公方。现在洪峰正向山东省寿张县孙口站推进。孙口站涨势很快，十九时水位为四十八点二五公尺，二十一时就已涨到四十八点四八公尺，流量为一万一千五百秒公方。现在，孙口站还在上涨。
    山东河段的河槽较河南段狭窄，堤上防汛力量已加强。
    河南段两岸堤上防汛大军仍在与洪水作持续的搏斗，没有放松警惕。这次特大洪峰过花园口后，水势下落很慢，花园口的流量较久地停滞在一万上下秒公方（昨报曾落至七千秒公方）。水位保持在九十三公尺以上的高水位。
    据新华社郑州19日电  黄河特大洪峰进入了山东省菏泽县河段后，因这段河槽已经逐渐缩窄，再加上前次洪峰的洪水还没有完全排泄下去，可能出现高水位持续时间长的现象。所以，特大洪峰虽已出了河南境，但水位还没有大落，河南的防汛大军仍然严守大堤。
