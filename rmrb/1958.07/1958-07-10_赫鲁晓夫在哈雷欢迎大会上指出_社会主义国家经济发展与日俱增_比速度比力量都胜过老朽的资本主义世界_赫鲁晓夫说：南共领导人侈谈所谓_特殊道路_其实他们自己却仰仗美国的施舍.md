Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, TASS, Halle, July 8th: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev said at a welcome rally in Halle attended by nearly 200,000 people on July 8th that the construction speed of socialist countries is getting faster and faster, socialist countries are becoming stronger year by year, and the friendship between socialist countries is developing and strengthening year by year. Only Yugoslavia is isolated. They talk a lot about their special road, but in fact they rely on American alms.

Khrushchev arrived in this important industrial city of the German Democratic Republic on the 8th for a visit before leading the Soviet Communist Party delegation to attend the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party. His speech at the welcome rally was warmly cheered by the masses. Lao, a member of the Political Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party, also spoke at the meeting.

After describing the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and its efforts to strive for peace, Khrushchev pointed out that capitalist propaganda organs insisted that if workers and peasants seized power, they would not be able to manage the country or organize production. These propaganda organs once hoped that the Soviet regime would soon collapse and insisted that communism was experiencing a crisis. However, now the whole world knows where the crisis is and where prosperity is. For example, the Soviet Union will build seven blast furnaces this year, and just after they are put into operation, they can increase pig iron production by more than 4.5 million tons. Let's see how much pig iron capitalist countries have increased their production by! So where is the crisis?

Khrushchev said that the speed of our socialist construction is getting faster and faster, socialist countries are becoming stronger year by year, and the friendship between socialist countries is developing and strengthening year by year. Only Yugoslavia is isolated. We have done and are doing a lot of work in the hope that Yugoslavia will be in step with all socialist countries. However, Yugoslav leaders do not want this, but talk a lot about their so-called special road, but in fact they rely on American alms. However, this road is not suitable for us. We are accustomed to building socialism in the struggle against capitalism.

Khrushchev said, taking the Soviet Union as an example, the exploiters once said that if the working class seized power, science would be unlucky. But now the whole world sees whose earth satellite is it? It is the Soviet Union's artificial earth satellite! The Americans launched three orange-sized satellites, and their satellites were only 1% of the third Soviet satellite. He said that this is our great victory, which demonstrates the will of the working class and the wisdom of the communist movement.

Khrushchev said that we advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems. We do not interfere and do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Let us compete, but not in war, but in peaceful competition. Let the young, developing, and increasingly powerful socialist countries compete with the old and decaying capitalist world to see who wins!

Khrushchev continued, Adenauer is still thinking about his "position of strength" policy. But this kind of strength only exists in his fantasy. Mr. Adenauer does not recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic. What can be done about it! Doesn't the United States also not recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China? But People's China does not cease to exist because of this. The United States also did not recognize the Soviet Union for a long time in the past. And the Soviet Union does not cease to exist because of this. He said that if you tell a blind person who has never seen the sun how bright the sun is, he will never understand it anyway. He will say, what sunlight, there is no such thing at all. The servants of capitalism are also unwilling to admit that socialism will replace capitalism. They stubbornly refuse to agree with this.

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to deny the achievements of socialism: the economic development of socialist countries is increasing day by day.

Khrushchev said, I would like to ask Mr. Adenauer not to get angry: We believe that if only the German Democratic Republic is a socialist country on German soil now, then one day the whole of Germany will embark on the road of socialism, and not only Germany, but the whole world will embark on this road.

Khrushchev finally said that the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party will open on July 10. We believe that the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party will be held at a very high level, and after the congress, the ranks of the working class in your republic will be more closely united around the German Socialist Unity Party, which represents the vital interests of the German working class, working peasants, and intellectuals.

Heinrich Rau pointed out the achievements made by the working people of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction in his speech at the meeting. He also said that in front of the German working class, there is not only the task of building socialism in the German Democratic Republic, but also a major historical task: to strive for the development of socialism throughout Germany, thereby ensuring peace. He also said that except in the German Democratic Republic, no economic miracles can be found anywhere in Germany. In recent weeks, the enthusiasm of the people has been high in the countryside and in enterprises, which shows that we have all the necessary strength to strive for great development.

    赫鲁晓夫在哈雷欢迎大会上指出
    社会主义国家经济发展与日俱增
    比速度比力量都胜过老朽的资本主义世界
    赫鲁晓夫说：南共领导人侈谈所谓“特殊道路”  其实他们自己却仰仗美国的施舍
    新华社9日讯  据塔斯社哈雷8日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫8日在哈雷将近二十万群众参加的欢迎大会上说，社会主义国家的建设速度越来越快，社会主义国家一年比一年强大，社会主义国家之间的友谊一年比一年发展和加强。只有南斯拉夫是孤立的。他们大谈他们的什么特殊道路，而其实他们自己却仰仗美国的施舍。
    赫鲁晓夫是在率领苏联共产党代表团出席德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以前，在8日到达民主德国这个重要工业城市进行访问的。他在欢迎大会上的讲话受到群众的热烈欢呼。德国统一社会党政治局委员劳也在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在叙述了苏联的和平外交政策和为了争取和平而作的努力以后指出，资本主义宣传机构硬说，如果工人和农民掌握了政权，他们就不会管理国家，不会组织生产。这些宣传机构曾经期望着苏维埃政权很快垮台，并且硬说共产主义在经历着危机。但是，现在全世界都知道，危机在什么地方，而繁荣又在什么地方。譬如苏联今年就要建成七座高炉，仅仅在它们投入生产后，就可以增加生铁生产四百五十万吨以上。我们看看，资本主义国家增产的生铁有多少！那么危机究竟在什么地方呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们社会主义建设的速度越来越快，社会主义国家一年比一年强大，社会主义国家之间的友谊一年比一年发展和加强。只有南斯拉夫是孤立的。我们过去和现在都做了许多工作，希望南斯拉夫同所有社会主义国家步调一致。但是南斯拉夫领导人不希望这样，而大谈他们的什么特殊道路，其实他们自己却仰仗美国的施舍。但是，这种道路对我们是不适合的。我们习惯于在同资本主义的斗争中建设社会主义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，拿苏联来说吧，譬如，剥削者曾经说，如果工人阶级掌握了政权，那么科学就要倒霉了。可是，现在全世界看见的是谁的地球卫星呢？是苏联的人造地球卫星！美国人放射了三枚橘子般的卫星，他们的这些卫星只有第三个苏联卫星的1％。他说，这是我们巨大的胜利，这里表现了工人阶级的意志和共产主义运动的智慧。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们主张不同制度的国家间和平共处。我们不干涉而且也不想干涉其他国家内政。让我们来较量较量吧，不过不是在战争中，而是在和平竞赛中。让年青的、不断发展的、日益强大的社会主义国家同老朽的资本主义世界展开竞赛，看看谁取得胜利吧！
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，阿登纳先生现在还在想他那套“实力地位”政策。但是这种实力只存在于他的幻想中。阿登纳先生不承认德意志民主共和国的存在。这有什么办法呢！美国不是也不承认中华人民共和国的存在吗？但是人民中国并不因此而不存在。美国以前也曾经长期不承认苏联。而苏联并不因此而不存在。他说，如果对从来没有看见过太阳的瞎子说太阳怎样光明灿烂，他无论如何是不会明白的。他会说，什么太阳光，根本就没那么一回事。资本主义的仆从也正是这样地不愿意承认社会主义要代替资本主义。他们固执地不愿同意这一点。
    然而，他们要否定社会主义的成就是越来越困难了：社会主义国家的经济发展与日俱增。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我想请阿登纳先生不必冒火：我们相信，如果说，现在德国土地上只有德意志民主共和国是社会主义国家，那么总会有一天整个德国走上社会主义的道路，而且不仅是德国，全世界都会走上这条道路。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会将在7月10日开幕。我们相信德国统一社会党第五次代表大会将在很高的水平上举行，而在大会以后你们共和国的工人阶级的队伍将更紧密地团结在德国统一社会党的周围，这个党代表着德国工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子的切身利益。
    海因里希·劳在大会上讲话时指出了德意志民主共和国劳动人民在社会主义建设方面所取得的成就。他并且说，在德国工人阶级面前，不仅有在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义的任务，而且还有一个重大的历史性任务：争取在全德范围内发展社会主义，从而保障和平。他还说，除了在德意志民主共和国，德国的任何地方都找不到经济奇迹了。最近几个星期中，在农村和企业中，人们的劳动热情高涨，这表明，我们拥有一切必要的力量来争取大发展。
