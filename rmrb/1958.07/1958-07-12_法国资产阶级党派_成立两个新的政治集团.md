Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 11th: De Gaulle has ordered that the initial draft of the so-called "Fifth Republic of France" constitution be prepared within a month. Currently, an "inter-ministerial committee" personally led by De Gaulle is meeting every night to accelerate the drafting process.

It is revealed that De Gaulle's new "constitution" will stipulate that the French president wields absolute power, while the National Assembly will be practically a mere formality.

French bourgeois politicians and non-party figures of various persuasions are intensifying their efforts to regroup under the threat of fascist dictatorship. A new organization called "Union of Democratic Forces" has already announced its establishment. Initiating this organization is the Human Rights League, led by Socialist Daniel Mayer; participants include Radical Socialist leader Mendès-France, leader of the Democratic Socialist Resistance Union, Mitterrand, and some members of these two parties, including Socialist members of parliament Édouard Depreux, Robert Verdier, and others, as well as Young Republicans, members of the Socialist Left League, and social celebrities Claude Bourdet and Cyrille Martine. This organization has received support from the National Education Federation, the National Teachers' Union, and the National Education General Confederation of Labour.

In addition, approximately thirty "centrist" members of the National Assembly agreed on the evening of the 10th to form a new center-left political group. Members of this group include former ministers Maurice Faure, Émile Hugues, Gilbert-Jules, and Édouard Bonnefous. It is said that this new group has already received the support of about sixty members of the Republic's Senate.

Right-wing elements are also actively engaged. The right-wing leader of the Popular Republican Movement, Bidault, is working to establish a "Catholic Democratic Party." A group calling themselves "Left-wing Gaullists" has established a so-called "Republican Reform Center"; this political group demands the complete destruction of the Constitution of the Fourth Republic of France.

The notorious fascist leader Charles Luca also organized a political party called "Movement of the French People." He openly clamored that "Fascism, especially French Fascism, is our only hope."

At the same time, the French Communist Party and progressive forces are carrying out large-scale propaganda and organizational work in order to defeat the fascist conspiracy. Currently, the French Communist Party is primarily organizing the people of the whole country to hold anti-fascist demonstrations on July 14th—the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison—which marks the revolutionary tradition of the French people, in order to deeply mobilize the people and turn the referendum into a fatal blow to the fascist dictatorship conspiracy.

    法国资产阶级党派
    成立两个新的政治集团
    新华社11日讯　巴黎消息：戴高乐已经下令要在一个月内把所谓
  “法兰西第五共和国”宪法草案初稿准备好。现在，戴高乐亲自领导的一个“部际委员会”每天晚上都要开会，以便加速起草工作。
    据透露，戴高乐的新“宪法”将规定法国总统独揽大权，而国民议会则几乎形同虚设。
    法国各资产阶级政党人士和各种倾向的无党派人士正在法西斯独裁威胁下加紧重新集结力量。一个叫做“民主力量联盟”的新组织已经宣布成立。发起这个组织的，是以社会党人丹尼埃·麦耶为首的人权联盟；参加的有激进社会党领袖孟戴斯—弗朗斯、民主社会抵抗联盟领袖密特朗以及这两个党的一些议员，其中有社会党议员爱德华·德普勒、罗伯·维迪埃等人，还有青年共和党人、社会主义左翼联盟盟员和社会名流克劳德·布尔戴、希尔·马蒂纳等。这个组织已经得到全国教育联合会、全国教师工会和国民教育总工会的支持。
    此外，大约有三十个“中间派”国民议会议员在10日晚上同意成立一个新的中间偏左政治集团。这个集团的成员包括前部长莫里斯·富尔、埃米尔·余格、希伯尔—儒勒和爱德华·庞纳福。据说，这个新的集团已经得到共和国参议院约六十个议员的支持。
    右翼分子也在积极活动。人民共和党右翼头子皮杜尔正在为成立“天主教民主党”而奔走。还有一群自称为“左翼戴高乐分子”的人成立了一个所谓“共和改革中心”；这个政治集团要求彻底摧毁法兰西第四共和国宪法。
    臭名远扬的法西斯头子夏尔·吕卡也组织了一个名叫“法兰西人民运动”的政党。他公开叫嚷说：“法西斯主义，特别是法国的法西斯主义，是我们的唯一希望。”
    与此同时，法国共产党和进步力量正在展开规模巨大的宣传和组织工作，以便击败法西斯阴谋。目前法国共产党首先是组织全国人民在标志着法国人民革命传统的7月14日——攻陷巴士底监狱的纪念日——举行反法西斯示威，以便深入动员人民，把公民投票变成对法西斯独裁阴谋的致命打击。
