Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 7th: Prince Sihanouk issued a statement on the 6th, stating that he would not go to South Vietnam to hold formal talks with Ngo Dinh Diem because South Vietnam had offended the dignity of his government and himself.

Prince Sihanouk had broadcast on July 1st that he was willing to go to Saigon and Bangkok to conduct secret negotiations with the South Vietnamese and Thai authorities regarding border issues.

In his statement yesterday, he said that while he intended to go to Saigon for talks, Ngo Dinh Diem's "Vietnam News Agency" published an editorial on July 3rd that insulted and offended him and his government. This insult showed no desire for mutual understanding or peaceful motives.

He also said that the Thai side had given a satisfactory reply to his plan. "I think I can go to Bangkok soon."

At the same time, the Cambodian National Radio broadcast Prince Sihanouk's speech in Kompong Cham Province on the 5th. In his speech, Sihanouk condemned the United States for supporting South Vietnam and deliberately insisting that he was the instigator of border incidents. He also condemned the United States for creating an excuse to provoke another act of aggression.

Sihanouk said that foreign aid had reduced Cambodia to a state of humiliation, and he had long wanted to reject foreign aid. He said that if Cambodia implemented compulsory military service, fully developed its own economy, and learned from China's construction model, it could live without foreign aid.

He added that Cambodia should have an ally because Cambodia did not want to be constantly humiliated. Cambodia will find a country with people of the same yellow skin among its neighbors to be its ally. If the people and the country demand it, he will do so. However, he also said that this would cause Cambodia to lose some of the foreign aid it receives.

    南越通讯社侮辱柬埔寨
    西哈努克表示不去西贡谈判
    并谴责美国企图掀起新的侵略事件
    据新华社金边7日电  西哈努克亲王在6日发表声明，表示不到南越去同吴庭艳举行正式会谈，因为南越触犯了他的政府和他个人的尊严。
    西哈努克亲王7月1日曾经发表广播说，他愿意到西贡和曼谷去同南越和泰国当局进行关于边界问题的秘密谈判。
    他在昨天发表的声明中说，在他打算到西贡去举行会谈的时候，吴庭艳的“越南新闻社”在7月3日发表了一篇社论，侮辱和触犯了他和他的政府。这种侮辱没有相互了解的愿望和和平的动机。
    他还说，泰国方面已经对他的计划给予令人满意的答复。“我想我最近可以到曼谷去”。
    同时，柬埔寨国家电台广播了西哈努克亲王5日在磅湛省发表的演说。西哈努克在演说中谴责美国支持南越并且故意硬说他是边境事件的制造者。他还谴责美国制造挑起另外一次侵略事件的借口。
    西哈努克说，外国援助使柬埔寨沦于受人侮辱的境地，他很久以来就想拒绝外国援助。他说，如果柬埔寨实行义务兵役制，全面发展自己的经济，并且学习中国建设的榜样，它就能不要外国援助而生活下去。
    他又说，柬埔寨应当有一个盟国，因为柬埔寨不想不断地受人侮辱。柬埔寨将在自己的邻国当中找到一个同样具有黄色皮肤的人民的国家来做自己的盟国。如果人民和国家要求的话，他就要这样做。但是，他又说，这将使柬埔寨损失它所得到的一部分外国援助。
