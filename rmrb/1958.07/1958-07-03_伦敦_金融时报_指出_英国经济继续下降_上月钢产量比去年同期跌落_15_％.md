Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2nd. An editorial in today's "Financial Times," commenting on the general trend of the British economy, pointed out that "the real question now is not whether (economic activity) will decline, but how quickly this decline will come and to what extent it might fall."

To support this argument, the newspaper cited several signs indicating that economic activity would experience a considerable decline.

The newspaper said that the industrial production index has recently become increasingly disturbing. "The level of industrial production, which a year or two ago could perhaps only be described as stagnant, has now begun to be called a recession." For example, steel production last month fell by 15% compared to the same month in 1957.

The newspaper believes that the "main reason for the British economic recession" is reduced investment. The editorial said that in the first quarter of this year, the number of approved factory expansion projects fell to the lowest level since the end of 1953, and it is not yet clear to what extent it will decline further.

The newspaper said that exports have also begun to decline for some time, and "it is very likely" that they will decline further in the coming months, which in turn will greatly affect production and employment. Motor vehicle exports have so far been the main pillar of British exports, but this pillar cannot be relied upon for much longer.

The newspaper said that "the most disturbing factor is the inventory situation." It pointed out that last year's inventory levels were too high, and now, given the decline in domestic economic activity, there will be a "trend" of "inventory decline" rather than increase, which will "contribute to the recession in the fall."

The newspaper said, "Based on the existing evidence," "a considerable recession will occur in the autumn."

### 伦敦“金融时报”指出  英国经济继续下降  上月钢产量比去年同期跌落15％

    伦敦“金融时报”指出
    英国经济继续下降
    上月钢产量比去年同期跌落15％
    新华社伦敦2日电　“金融时报”今天的社论在评论英国经济的总趋势时指出，“实际的问题现在不是（经济活动）是否会下降，而是这种下降会来得多快和它可能下降到什么程度。”
    为了支持这个论点，这家报纸举出了几个表明经济活动会有相当巨大的下降的迹象。
    这家报纸说，工业生产指数近来愈来愈令人感到不安，“工业生产水平在一两年前也许只能说是停滞，而现在已开始可以称为衰退了。”例如，上个月的钢产量比1957年同一月份下降了15％。
    这家报纸认为，英国经济“衰退的主要原因”是投资减少。社论说，在今年第一季，已经批准的扩建工厂的数目下降到了1953年年底以来最低的水平，以后要下降到什么程度现在还不清楚。
    这家报纸说，出口也早已开始下降，在今后几个月中“十分可能”还要下降，而这反过来又会大大影响生产和就业。机动车辆的出口迄今一直是英国出口的主要支柱，但是这根支柱已经不能依靠很久了。
    这家报纸说，“最令人感到不安的因素是存货情况”。它指出，去年的存货数量过高，现在鉴于国内经济活动下降，将出现“存货下降”而不是上升的“动向”，而这将会“促成秋季的衰退”。
    报纸说，“根据现有的各种证据”，“秋天将出现相当规模的衰退”。
