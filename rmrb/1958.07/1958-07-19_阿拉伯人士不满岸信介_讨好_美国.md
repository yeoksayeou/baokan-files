Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 18th: The Kishi Nobusuke government's "double-dealing" attitude towards the armed aggression of Middle Eastern countries by the United States and Britain has aroused dissatisfaction among Arab figures.

According to a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Cairo, Arab figures were deeply disappointed to hear that Japan abstained from voting on the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the resolution of the Middle East issue in the United Nations Security Council, and instead expressed support for the US proposal. Some Arab figures in Cairo stated that Japan's attitude was "inconsistent," and some even criticized Japan for "wagging its tail" to please Washington.
