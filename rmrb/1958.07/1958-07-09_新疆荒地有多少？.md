How much wasteland is there in Xinjiang?

Xinjiang's land area accounts for one-sixth of the country's total, equivalent to about eight Hebei provinces or sixteen Zhejiang provinces. The wasteland distributed in the Tarim Basin and Junggar Basin is about 300 million mu. According to current water and soil balance data, 150 million mu of wasteland can be reclaimed into farmland, which is about five times the existing cultivated land area of the autonomous region. At present, a total of 250 million mu of wasteland has been surveyed in the entire autonomous region.

Wasteland surveyors began entering the vast wilderness north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in 1955 to investigate the distribution of wasteland, soil structure, and landform conditions there, in order to find usable land for the people of all ethnic groups. After more than three years of arduous investigation, the large areas of wasteland in Xinjiang have been marked as generally surveyed. Among them, more than 17 million mu of wasteland along the Tarim River, Yarkand River, and Ili River have been topographically surveyed and can be developed immediately.

    新疆荒地有多少？
    新疆土地面积占全国六分之一，约等于八个河北省或十六个浙江省的面积。分布在塔里木盆地和准噶尔盆地等地的荒地约有三亿亩，根据目前水土平衡资料，其中一亿五千万亩荒地可以垦为农田，约等于自治区现有耕地面积的五倍。目前，全自治区已经调查过的荒地共已达到两亿五千万亩。
    荒地勘测人员从1955年就开始进入天山南北广大的荒原中，调查那里的荒地分布、土壤结构和地形状况，为各族人民寻找可以利用的土地。经过三年多的艰苦调查，全疆大面积的荒地都已插上了概查过的标志。其中塔里木河、叶尔羌河以及伊犁河两岸一千七百多万亩荒地已经进行了地形测量，可以立即开发。  （据新华社讯）
