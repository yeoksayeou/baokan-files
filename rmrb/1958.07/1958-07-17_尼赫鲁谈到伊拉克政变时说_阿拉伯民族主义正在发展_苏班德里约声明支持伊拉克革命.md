Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on the 15th that the military coup in Iraq is a sign of the growing development of Arab nationalism.

Prime Minister Nehru made the remarks at a mass rally in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. He considered it inappropriate to comment on the developments in Iraq. However, he went on to say, "One thing is very clear, and that is that nationalism is developing in all countries. Similarly, Arab nationalism is also developing. But the difficulty is that the major powers have not recognized this – the developing nationalism. We cannot give them any advice."

He said that what is happening is a "very significant matter," and no one knows what the result will be.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio issued a statement on the 15th regarding the Iraqi coup, saying that the Iraqi people themselves should make choices on the Iraqi issue, and outsiders should recognize Iraq's national aspirations. He hoped that the spirit of the Bandung Conference would be applied to resolve the Iraqi issue.

Subandrio made the above statement to the press after separately receiving the ambassadors of the United Arab Republic, the Soviet Union, and the United States, as well as the ambassador of the Iraq-Jordan Federation.

    尼赫鲁谈到伊拉克政变时说
    阿拉伯民族主义正在发展
    苏班德里约声明支持伊拉克革命
    据新华社新德里16日电　印度总理尼赫鲁15日说，在伊拉克发生的军事政变是表明阿拉伯的民族主义日益发展的征象。
    尼赫鲁总理在印度北方邦阿拉哈巴德的一次群众大会上这样说。他认为对伊拉克的事态发展发表意见是不适当的。但是，他接着说，“有一件事情是十分清楚的，就是民族主义正在所有国家里发展着。同样，阿拉伯的民族主义也正在发展着。但是，困难是大国没有认识到这一点——正在发展着的民族主义。我们不能给他们以任何忠告。”
    他说，正在发生的是“意义非常重大的事情”，谁也不知道它的结果如何。
    据新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约15日就伊拉克政变发表声明说，在伊拉克问题上应该由伊拉克人民自己作出抉择，外界人士应该承认伊拉克的民族愿望。他希望会应用万隆会议的精神来解决伊拉克问题。
    苏班德里约是在分别接见了阿拉伯联合共和国、苏联和美国的大使以及伊拉克—约旦联邦的大使后向报界发表上述声明的。
