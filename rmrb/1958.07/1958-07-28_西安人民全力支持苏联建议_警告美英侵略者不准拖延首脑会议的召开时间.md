Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 27th. After learning the news that the Soviet government has agreed to hold a summit conference within the framework of the United Nations Security Council, people from all walks of life in Xi'an have expressed warm support. People unanimously believe that this is a major step taken by the Soviet Union to strive for world peace, and solemnly warn the American and British aggressors: they should immediately stop their acts of aggression and promptly convene a five-nation government summit conference in accordance with Khrushchev's proposal.

    Workers from factories such as the Xi'an Mining Machinery Repair Factory, the Yellow River Cotton Textile Factory, and the Qinling Thermos Bottle Factory held gatherings during production breaks. Zong Xian, an advanced producer and blacksmith from the Mining Repair Factory, said in his speech that Khrushchev wrote to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, France, and India again, agreeing to hold a five-nation government summit conference within the scope of the Security Council to quickly stop the American and British aggression in the Middle East. This once again proves that the Soviet Union is sincerely considering the interests of world peace. If American and British imperialism continue to play shameless and cunning tricks, it will further expose their aggressive face.

    All members of the Hongguang Vegetable Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of the city also held a gathering to protest against American and British aggression in the Middle East. They unanimously supported the measures taken by the Soviet government, and pointed out that this is giving American and British imperialism one last chance to come to their senses. If the United States and Britain do not honestly sit down for negotiations and continue to create war provocations in the Middle East, they will inevitably suffer the consequences. Ma Mingbao, Imam of the Dapiyuan Mosque, said that more than 300 Muslim households in our Dapiyuan Lane fully support the Soviet government's proposal and will never allow the American and British aggressors to unreasonably delay the convening of the summit conference.

    西安人民全力支持苏联建议
    警告美英侵略者不准拖延首脑会议的召开时间
    新华社西安27日电　西安市各界人民在获悉苏联政府同意在联合国安理会范围内举行首脑会议的消息以后，都表示热烈拥护和支持。人们一致认为，这是苏联为争取世界和平而采取的一项重大步骤，并且严正警告美英侵略者：应该立即停止侵略罪行，按照赫鲁晓夫的建议迅速召开五国政府首脑会议。
    西安矿山机械修配厂、黄河棉织厂、秦岭热水瓶制造厂等厂职工，利用生产空隙时间举行了集会。矿山修配厂先进生产者、锻工宗宪发言说，赫鲁晓夫再次写信给美、英、法、印四国首脑，同意在安理会范围内举行五国政府首脑会议，迅速制止美英对中东的侵略，这又一次证明苏联是真诚地为世界和平利益着想。如果美英帝国主义继续耍无耻狡猾手段，就更加暴露出它的侵略面目。
    市郊红光蔬菜农业社全体社员也举行集会，抗议美英侵略中东。他们一致拥护苏联政府的措施，并且指出，这是给美英帝国主义最后一个悬崖勒马的机会。美英再不老老实实坐下来谈判，继续在中东制造战争挑衅的话，就必将自食其果。大皮院清真寺阿訇马明宝说，我们大皮院巷三百多户穆斯林全力支持苏联政府的建议，决不允许美英侵略者再无理拖延首脑会议召开的时间。
