Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: At the East Sea Fleet Activist Representatives Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, which concluded on the 26th, more than 200 outstanding officers and soldiers from the front lines of the East Sea, representing all officers and soldiers of the fleet, expressed that they would further accelerate the improvement of combat effectiveness in strengthening combat readiness training and be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time.

The representatives attending the meeting expressed great indignation at the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, while at the same time instigating the Chiang Kai-shek clique to attempt to exploit the situation. They accused these pirates of their crimes at the meeting. Yu Huawu, the captain of a certain torpedo boat unit, said at the meeting, "We are ready for anything. As long as the enemy dares to move, we will bury them at the bottom of the sea like we sank their 'Taiping' ship." Guo Tianyou, the deputy captain of the heroic boat in the Toumenshan naval battle, said: "The Chiang Kai-shek clique's attempt to 'counterattack the mainland' while the United States and Britain are invading the Middle East is just a pipe dream. When we fought for Yijiangshan Island, we only took a little over an hour to resolve the battle. Now, after more than three years of training, our combat effectiveness has been unprecedentedly improved. They still can't escape from our grasp."

The East Sea Fleet Activist Representatives Conference was a major review of maritime combat power. It shows that the East Sea Fleet, guarding the East Sea of the motherland, has rapidly strengthened its combat power to defend the territorial waters of the motherland and prepare to liberate Taiwan in the past six months. Many units have completed their annual training tasks ahead of schedule and rapidly improved their combat effectiveness. Yu Huawu, the captain of a certain torpedo boat who participated in the sinking of the enemy ship "Taiping," is now an excellent squadron commander. This young commander has been skillfully maneuvering fast boats in complex situations, ensuring safe navigation for more than six years. This torpedo boat unit achieved a 100% hit rate in this year's torpedo firing exercise. A certain ship, by improving its operating methods and innovating its technology, has enabled the ship to quickly enter combat in the shortest possible time, greatly improving the ship's combat mobility.

During the meeting, the representatives also presented nearly 200 treasures to show their determination and confidence in further accelerating the improvement of combat effectiveness, making full preparations for the liberation of Taiwan, and defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    东海舰队积极分子代表会议
    警告蒋帮休想趁火打劫
    控诉美英海盗罪行决心加强保卫祖国的力量
    新华社上海27日电　在26日结束的中国人民解放军海军东海舰队积极分子代表会议上，来自祖国东海前线二百多位优秀的军官和士兵，代表全舰队官兵表示，要在加强战备训练中，进一步加速提高战斗力，随时准备解放台湾。
    到会的代表，对于美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的同时，又指使蒋介石集团妄想趁火打劫，表示极大的愤怒，纷纷在会上控诉这些海盗的罪行。某鱼雷快艇部队中队长于化武在会上表示，我们什么都已准备好，只要敌人胆敢动一动，我们就要像击沉它的“太平”号一样，把它们葬身海底。头门山海战英雄艇副艇长郭天佑说：“蒋介石集团妄想趁美英侵略中东‘反攻大陆’，真是痴人做梦。我们打一江山岛时，仅一个多小时就解决战斗，现在我们经过三年多的训练，战斗力空前提高，他还逃得出我们的手掌心。”
    东海舰队积极分子代表会议是一个检阅海上战斗力量的大会。它表明了守卫在祖国东海的东海舰队，半年多以来，保卫祖国领海、准备解放台湾的战斗力量已迅速增强。许多单位都提前完成了全年训练任务，迅速地提高了部队的战斗力。曾经参加过击沉敌舰“太平”号的某鱼雷艇艇长于化武，现在已是一个优秀的中队指挥员了。这位年青的指挥员在复杂的情况下，自如地操纵着快艇，保证安全航行了六年多。这支鱼雷快艇部队在今年施放鱼雷演习中，百分之百的命中了目标。某舰由于改进了操作方法，革新了技术，使舰艇能在最短的时间内迅速的投入战斗，大大提高了舰艇战斗的能动性。
    会议期间，代表们还献宝近二百件，以表示他们进一步加速提高战斗力，为解放台湾，为保卫远东和世界和平作好充分准备的决心和信心。
