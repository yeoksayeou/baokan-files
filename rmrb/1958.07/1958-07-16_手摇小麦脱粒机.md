    Hand-Operated Wheat Thresher
    The Farm Implement Factory of Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has successfully trial-produced and begun producing a hand-operated wheat thresher suitable for the current situation of insufficient power in rural areas, based on the principle of motorized threshers.
    Using this hand-operated thresher, four people can thresh 8,000 to 9,000 jin of wheat per day, which is ten times more efficient than using the old methods. When power is available, it can also be converted into a motorized thresher.

    手摇小麦脱粒机
    湖北省光化县农具厂根据机动脱粒机原理试制成功并且开始生产一种适合目前农村动力缺乏情况下用的手摇小麦脱粒机。
    用这种手摇脱粒机，每部四个人，一天可打麦子八千到九千斤，比用旧的方法脱粒提高工效十倍。在有动力的时候还可改装成机动脱粒机。
