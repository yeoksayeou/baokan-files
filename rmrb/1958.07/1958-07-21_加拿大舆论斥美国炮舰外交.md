    Ottawa dispatch: The American aggression against Lebanon and the Canadian government's support for the American aggression have aroused the indignation of broad sections of the Canadian people.
    An editorial published in the "Toronto Daily Star" stated that, like the British and French aggression against Egypt, the American military intervention in Lebanon is unjust and short-sighted. This is exactly gunboat diplomacy. President Eisenhower, who had hypocritically talked about the Suez Canal issue, is now hypocritically saying that the landing of the US Marines is necessary to protect the lives of American nationals and defend Lebanon from "indirect aggression." Neither side in the Lebanese civil war has harmed any Americans. The US Marines landed in Lebanon to prevent an event similar to what happened in Iraq from occurring in Lebanon, and possibly in Jordan.
    The "Toronto Daily Star" went on to explain that the American attempt to invoke the United Nations Charter and the Eisenhower Doctrine as a pretext for its military intervention is untenable.

    加拿大舆论斥美国炮舰外交
    据渥太华消息，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略和加拿大政府对美国侵略行动的支持，引起了加拿大人民广大阶层的愤慨。
    “多伦多每日星报”发表的社论说，如同英法侵略埃及一样，美国对黎巴嫩进行的军事干涉是非正义的，是毫无远见的。这正是一种炮舰外交。曾经假惺惺地谈到过苏伊士问题的艾森豪威尔总统，今天又在假仁假义地说，美国海军陆战队的登陆是保护美国侨民的生命和保卫黎巴嫩不受“间接侵略”所必需的。黎巴嫩国内战争的交战双方并没有使任何一个美国人受到损害。美国海军陆战队在黎巴嫩登陆是为了在黎巴嫩，可能的话，也在约旦防止发生同伊拉克类似的事件。
      “多伦多每日星报”接着说明，美国企图引用联合国宪章和艾森豪威尔主义来作为自己进行军事干涉的借口，这是站不住脚的。
