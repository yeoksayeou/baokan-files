    What is a "Plasma Zone"?
    In the past, people's concept of matter was this: it has three states, namely solid, liquid, and gas. The state of matter is determined by the temperature. For example, a piece of iron, if we heat it to 1500 degrees Celsius, it will become a liquid; if we continue to raise the temperature to a certain level, the liquid will boil and vaporize. After that, no matter how much we heat it, it remains a gas and no longer changes.
    Now scientists have proven that this concept is wrong. In addition to the above three states, matter also has a fourth state—the plasma zone. A large part of the matter in the universe is in this state.
    What is a "Plasma Zone"?
    We know that molecules are composed of atoms, and atoms are composed of positively charged particles—namely, the nucleus, and negatively charged particles—namely, electrons. Under normal circumstances, the positive charge carried by the nucleus and the negative charge carried by the electrons in a molecule exactly cancel each other out, so the entire molecule is not charged. That is to say, they are electrically neutral. But if one or several electrons leave the molecule, then the molecule will have excess positive charge. Therefore, we call this molecule that has lost electrons a positive ion, and the electron that has escaped from the molecule is called a free electron. A gas composed of positive ions, free electrons, and a small amount of molecules that have not lost electrons is called a "plasma zone." Obviously, the plasma zone is not charged, because the free electrons continue to remain in the gas of the plasma zone, and the negative charge they carry exactly cancels out the positive charge carried by the positive ions.
    Electric current can easily flow through the plasma zone. When a very strong current is passed through the plasma zone, the plasma zone will contract violently due to the action of electromagnetic force and generate high temperatures of up to millions of degrees. This technology will be of great use to scientific research and production practice in the future. (Wu Yuan)

### 什么叫“等离子区”？

    什么叫“等离子区”？
    以往，人们对物质的概念是这样的：它有三种状态，即固态、液态和气态。物质的状态决定于温度的高低。例如一块铁，我们把它加热到摄氏一千五百度，它就会变成液体；把温度继续提高到一定程度时，液体就会沸腾而汽化。此后，不管怎样加热，它仍然是一种气体，不再发生变化。
    现在科学家证明，这个概念是错误的。物质除了上述三种状态以外，还有第四种状态——等离子区。宇宙间的较大一部分物质都处于这种状态。
    什么叫“等离子区”？
    我们知道，分子是由原子组成的，原子是由带阳电的微粒——即原子核和带阴电的微粒——即电子组成的。在一般情况下，分子里的原子核所带阳电和电子所带阴电恰好抵消，因此整个分子是不带电的。也就是说，它们是电中性的。但如果分子里面有一个或几个电子离开了这个分子，那么这个分子就有了多余的阳电，因此，这种失去电子的分子，我们称它为阳离子，而脱离了分子的电子称为游离电子。由阳离子、游离电子和较少量的未失去电子的分子所组成的气体就叫“等离子区”。显然等离子区是不带电的，因为游离电子仍继续留在等离子区的气体中，它们所带的阴电恰好和阳离子所带的阳电抵消。
    电流很容易在等离子区中流过。当在等离子区中通过很强大的电流时，等离子区会由于电磁力的作用而剧烈收缩，并且产生高达几百万度以上的高温。这方面的技术以后对科学研究和生产实践都会有很大用途。　　　　（吴元）
