Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: New York dispatch: Soviet Representative Sobolev vetoed a Japanese proposal in the United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on the 22nd, which was essentially an attempt to have the United Nations support the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and Britain.

The voting situation for the Japanese proposal was: ten votes in favor, Soviet Union against. The Soviet Union is a permanent member of the Security Council, so the proposal could not be passed.

Before the vote, Sobolev once again explained in detail the Soviet Union's attitude towards this Japanese proposal, which was supported by Western countries.

Sobolev said that the Soviet delegation could not agree to this proposal because it not only failed to condemn the aggressive actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East, but in essence, supported the US and UK troops' invasion of Lebanon and Jordan. The proposal did not demand the immediate withdrawal of US and UK troops from the aforementioned countries, and such a withdrawal should be a prerequisite for any resolution made by the United Nations regarding the elimination of the extremely dangerous situation in the Middle East.

If the Security Council were to pass the Japanese proposal, it would allow Western countries to obtain approval from the Security Council and the United Nations for the US and UK occupation of Lebanon and Jordan, while also preparing conditions for them to occupy other Arab countries, especially Iraq.

Sobolev said that the proposal stipulates the expansion of the activities of the United Nations observation group under the condition of the US military occupation of Lebanon. If the Security Council passes this proposal, it would be equivalent to making the United Nations a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of the Lebanese people, which is a blatant violation of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter.

Sobolev said that in order to make the Japanese proposal comply with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, the Soviet representative proposed amendments to the Japanese proposal. The Soviet delegation suggested restoring the first point of the original Japanese proposal, which is to suggest that the United Nations observation group continue its work in Lebanon. Another amendment is: the Japanese proposal should stipulate that the Secretary-General of the United Nations immediately implement the plan proposed by the United Nations Lebanon observation group in its second report to supplement the measures stipulated in the June 11 resolution (in this report, the United Nations observation group clearly pointed out that the observation group should increase its number and proposed some supplementary measures needed to implement the tasks assigned to it according to the Security Council's June 11 resolution). The Soviet delegation also suggested adding a point to the Japanese proposal: "Confirming that the landing of US troops in Lebanon is interference in the internal affairs of the country, and thus violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw its armed forces from Lebanon."

British representative Dixon opposed the Soviet amendments, saying that the key parts of these amendments "are not acceptable to us." This shows that the United States and Britain are still planning to continue their aggression against the Middle East and have no intention of withdrawing their troops.

The voting situation for the Soviet amendments was: eight votes against, one vote in favor (Soviet Union), and two abstentions (Sweden and Japan). The amendments were not passed.

After the Soviet amendments and the Japanese proposal were rejected, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld spoke, saying that he would continue to take measures to fill the vacuum left by the Security Council's failure to take action. He mentioned further strengthening the United Nations Lebanon observation group, but did not demand the withdrawal of US troops at all.

Security Council President Araujo said that in view of the proposal by Soviet Premier Khrushchev to convene a summit meeting of major powers and the counter-proposals of Western countries, the situation is now very complicated, and he advocated that the Security Council adjourn indefinitely. Soviet Representative Sobolev disagreed with this view, pointing out that the failure of the Security Council to take action is the responsibility of the United States and Britain. Khrushchev's proposal must not become an excuse for the United Nations to stop considering the issue of US-British aggression against Arab countries. Sobolev advocated that the Security Council hold a meeting on the 23rd to consider the issue of convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. However, under the manipulation of Western countries, the Security Council's meeting on this day ultimately decided to adjourn indefinitely.

Thus, due to the position taken by Western countries, the Security Council has not made any decision on the US and UK armed aggression against Arab countries. This fact can only be regarded as condoning colonial countries to carry out aggression and armed plunder against weak nations. In addition, the Security Council indefinitely delaying the review of the suggestion to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss US and UK aggression, the mastermind of this matter is actually the United States, which once again shows that the United States really does not want to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly and is afraid of convening such a meeting.

### 不容用联合国来掩饰美英侵略者  苏联代表否决日本帮凶提案  安理会在美英操纵下已无限期休会

    不容用联合国来掩饰美英侵略者
    苏联代表否决日本帮凶提案
    安理会在美英操纵下已无限期休会
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：苏联代表索波列夫22日在联合国安全理事会紧急会议上否决了日本提出的实际上是企图要联合国支持美国和英国武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的提案。
    日本提案的表决情况是：十票赞成、苏联反对。苏联是安全理事会常任理事国，因此提案不能通过。
    在表决前，索波列夫再一次详细地表明了苏联对这个得到西方国家支持的日本提案的态度。
    索波列夫说，苏联代表团不能同意这个提案，理由是：提案不仅没有谴责美国和英国在中近东的侵略行动，实质上反而是支持美英军队进犯黎巴嫩和约旦。这个提案没有要求美英军队立即撤出上述国家，而这种撤出应该是联合国作出关于消除中近东极其危险的局势的任何决议的前提。
    安全理事会如果通过日本提案，就使西方国家有可能得到安全理事会和联合国对美英占领黎巴嫩和约旦的行动的批准，同时为它们占领其他阿拉伯国家，特别是伊拉克准备条件。
    索波列夫说，提案规定在美国军队占领黎巴嫩的条件下扩大联合国观察团的活动。安全理事会通过这项提案就等于使联合国成为美国干涉黎巴嫩人民内政的工具，而这是对联合国宪章基本原则的粗暴破坏。
    索波列夫说，为了使日本提案能够符合联合国宗旨和原则，苏联代表对日本提案提出修正案。苏联代表团建议恢复日本原提案的第一点，就是建议联合国观察团在黎巴嫩继续进行自己的工作。另一个修正是：日本的提案应该规定建议联合国秘书长立即实现联合国黎巴嫩观察团在它的第二个报告中所提出的计划以补充6月11日的决议所规定的措施（联合国观察团在这个报告中明确指出观察团应当增加它的人数，并且提出执行根据安全理事会6月11日的决议给它规定的任务所需要的一些补充办法）。苏联代表团还建议在日本的提案中加进一点：“确认，美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆是干涉这个国家的内政，因而违背联合国的宗旨和原则，要求美国立即把它的武装部队撤出黎巴嫩。”
    英国代表狄克逊反对苏联的修正案，他说，这些修正案的关键部分“不是我们所能接受的”。这就表明，美英两国仍在打算继续它们对中东的侵略，无意撤出它们的军队。
    苏联修正案的表决情况是：八票反对，一票赞成（苏联）、两票（瑞典和日本）弃权。修正案没有得到通过。
    在苏联修正案和日本提案被否决后，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德发言说，他要继续采取措施来填补由于安全理事会不能采取行动而留下的真空。他提到要进一步加强联合国黎巴嫩观察团，但却完全没有要求美国撤军。
    安全理事会主席阿劳霍说，鉴于苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出召开大国政府首脑会议的建议和西方国家的反建议，现在情况很复杂，他主张安全理事会无限期休会。苏联代表索波列夫不同意这个意见，他指出，安全理事会不能采取行动，这要由美英两国来负责。赫鲁晓夫的建议绝不能成为联合国停止考虑美英侵略阿拉伯国家问题的借口。索波列夫主张安全理事会在23日举行会议，考虑召开联合国大会紧急会议的问题。但是安全理事会这一天会议在西方国家的操纵下最后还是决定无限期休会。
    这样，由于西方国家所采取的立场，安全理事会对美英武装侵略阿拉伯国家就没有作出任何决定。这一事实只能被认为是纵容殖民国家对弱小民族进行侵略和武装掠夺。此外，安全理事会把审查关于召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论美英侵略行动的建议无限期地拖延下来，这件事的主谋者实际上是美国，这就再一次表明，美国确实不想召开联合国大会紧急会议，并且害怕召开这样的会议。
