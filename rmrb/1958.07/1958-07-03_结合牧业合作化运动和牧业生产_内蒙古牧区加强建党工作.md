    Xilinhot Dispatch from our newspaper (Reporter Zhao Yongxi): In order to adapt to the situation of great development in pastoral cooperativization, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will universally strengthen party building work in pastoral areas. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that in the next two years, in conjunction with the establishment and rectification of communes and other central tasks, branches should be universally established in pastoral cooperatives where conditions permit, or a branch should be established for several adjacent small cooperatives. In pastoral year-round mutual aid teams and other departments and systems in pastoral areas where the party's foundation is relatively weak, a number of new party members should also be admitted in a planned manner.
    In recent years, the party organizations in the vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have made certain progress. By the end of last year, there were 461 pastoral branches. However, under the new situation of the great development of pastoral cooperativization and the great leap forward in pastoral production, the number of existing pastoral branches and Communist Party members among herdsmen is already insufficient and unevenly distributed. On the other hand, in last year's socialist education movement and the current pastoral cooperativization movement, a large number of activists with firm stances and support for socialism have emerged; the party committees and organizations of banners and sumus in pastoral areas have been universally strengthened, creating extremely favorable conditions for carrying out party building work. Therefore, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to strengthen party building work immediately.
    The Inner Mongolia Party Committee has issued instructions on party building work, emphasizing the need to resolutely implement the policy of actively and cautiously building the party to ensure the quality of new party members. It requires party organizations at all levels in pastoral areas to formulate party building plans in accordance with this policy and principle, and to immediately improve the professional and ideological level of party building cadres through short-term training, professional conferences, and other methods, so that they can correctly grasp the conditions for party membership, strictly implement the procedures for new party members to join the party, and strengthen the work of probationary party members. The selection, training, investigation, and understanding of activists must be carried out through actual struggle and mass feedback. At present, party organizations at all levels in pastoral areas are actively preparing to carry out party building work in accordance with the instructions of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee.

    结合牧业合作化运动和牧业生产
    内蒙古牧区加强建党工作
    本报锡林浩特电　记者赵永西报道：内蒙古自治区为了适应牧业合作化大发展形势，将普遍加强牧区建党工作。中共内蒙古自治区委员会要求在今明两年内结合建社整社以及其他中心工作，在有条件的牧业社普遍建立起支部，或者相近几个小社建立一个支部。在牧业常年互助组和牧区其他党的基础比较薄弱的部门与系统中，也要有计划地适当接收一批新党员。
    几年来，内蒙古广大牧区党的组织有了一定的发展。到去年年底止，已有牧区支部四百六十一个。但是，在目前牧业合作化大发展和牧业生产大跃进的新的形势下，现有这些牧区支部和牧民共产党员的数量，已经显得很不够，而且分布不平衡。另一方面，在去年社会主义教育运动和当前牧业合作化运动中，又涌现出大批立场坚定、拥护社会主义的积极分子；牧区的旗和苏木的党委组织普遍有了加强，给开展建党工作创造了极为有利的条件。因此，中共内蒙古自治区委员会决定立即加强建党工作。
    内蒙古党委已发出了建党工作的指示，强调要坚决贯彻积极慎重的建党方针，保证新党员的质量。要求牧区各级党组织根据这一方针、原则做好建党计划，并立即用短期训练、召开专业会议等方式提高建党干部的业务、思想水平，使他们能够正确掌握党员条件，严格执行新党员入党手续，和加强对预备党员的工作。对积极分子的挑选培养和考察了解工作，强调必须通过实际斗争和群众反映来进行。现在，牧区各级党组织正按照内蒙古党委指示，积极准备开展建党工作。
