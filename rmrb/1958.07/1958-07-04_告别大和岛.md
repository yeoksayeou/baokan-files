    "People's Army sentinel comrade: Volunteer Army Private Wang Menglin begins to hand over the shift. During my duty, I discovered five fishing boats and one gunboat to my right front. The gunboat is protecting the fishing boats while they fish..." At exactly 10:00 AM on June 22nd, Wang Menglin, a sentinel guarding a certain position on Dahe Island, finished his last shift and handed over the post to Park Byung-hak, a Private First Class of the People's Army takeover troops. Wang Menglin took out a handkerchief printed with the words "Eternal Friendship between China and Korea" in both Chinese and Korean and gave it to this People's Army comrade. Then, he ran back to the Volunteer Army unit.

    On the parade ground next to the main peak of Dahe Island, the fully armed Volunteer Army officers and soldiers raised their right arms, clenched their fists, and gazed at the enemy-occupied islands in the distance, solemnly bidding farewell to the position. They swore: In the past, we came for peace, and today we leave for peace. We are soldiers who defend peace, and we will always be loyal to the cause of peace for all mankind!

    In this unforgettable moment, the peace fighters who gloriously defended this sea fortress felt deeply proud of the days and nights they had spent here. On the night of November 30, 1951, a shock team led by Volunteer Army Regiment Commander Zhao Yuwen, under the cover of air force squadrons and powerful artillery fire, repelled two interceptions by enemy warships, forcibly landed on Dahe Island, and annihilated the "White Horse" troops of the Lee Seung-man bandit army entrenched on the island. From then on, the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers had been stationed on this isolated island for a long time, vigilantly monitoring the restless ocean.

    On the eve of the withdrawal from Dahe Island, the officers and soldiers reluctantly bid farewell to their close brothers-in-arms, the searchlight troops of the People's Army, who had guarded this sea fortress alongside them for a long time. They had forged a deep friendship in the years of joint defense. The first squad of the Volunteer Army's meritorious company and a searchlight squad of the People's Army were stationed on the same position, just like a family. Whatever food one squad had, the other squad would definitely have some. When the first squad received white flour and pork from China, they always shared some with the searchlight squad; when the searchlight squad received Korean rice, fresh fish, and apples, they hurriedly sent some to the first squad. During holidays and festivals, the two squads often held evening parties together, listening to Pyongyang radio for a while, then listening to Beijing radio for a while, and then singing and dancing together. Now, for the sake of peace, the Volunteer Army troops have gloriously withdrawn from Dahe Island. When the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers bid each other farewell, Volunteer Army Private Li Boyu embraced Liu Sanlu, the squad leader of the People's Army, and gave him one of a pair of embroidered pillows that his fiancée had embroidered for him when he joined the Volunteer Army, writing on the pillow: "One pillow stays in Korea, one pillow stays by my side, comrades are like brothers, the friendship between China and Korea lasts forever."

    告别大和岛
    新华社记者　于逢源
    “人民军哨兵同志：志愿军下士哨兵王梦林开始交班。在我执行勤务期间，发现我的右前方海面上有五只渔船、一艘炮艇，炮艇在保护渔船捕鱼……”。6月22日上午十时整，守卫大和岛某阵地的哨兵王梦林，站完最后一班岗，把哨位交给了人民军接防部队上等兵朴炳学。王梦林从衣袋里掏出一块用中朝两国文字印有“中朝友谊万古长青”字样的手帕送给了这位人民军战友。然后，他跑步返回志愿军部队。
    在大和岛主峰旁边的操场上，整装待发的志愿军官兵，高举右臂握紧拳头，凝视着远方敌占岛屿，庄严地向阵地告别。他们宣誓：过去我们为和平而来，今天我们为和平而去。我们是保卫和平的战士，我们永远忠于全人类的和平事业！
    在这难忘的时刻里，光荣地捍卫了这座海上堡垒的和平战士们，深深为自己在这里渡过的日日夜夜而自豪。1951年11月30日夜里，志愿军团长赵玉温率领的突击队，在空军机群和强大炮火掩护下，击退了敌人军舰的两次拦击，强行登上大和岛，全歼了盘踞岛上的李承晚匪军“白马”部队。从那时起，志愿军官兵们就长期守卫在这座孤岛上，警惕地监视着不宁静的海洋。
    撤离大和岛前夕，官兵们依依不舍地辞别了长期并肩守卫这座海上堡垒的亲兄弟——人民军探照灯部队的战友们。他们在长年的共同守卫中结成了深厚的友谊。志愿军功臣连的第一班和人民军的一个探照灯班驻守在一个阵地上，完全像一家人一样。任何食物，只要这一个班有，另一个班也一定会有。一班领到来自中国的白面、猪肉，总要分一些给探照灯班；探照灯班领到朝鲜大米、鲜鱼、苹果，也急忙送些给一班。每逢假日和节日，这两个班还常在一起开晚会，听一会平壤的广播，再听一会北京的广播，然后歌舞联欢。现在，为了和平，志愿军部队光荣地撤离了大和岛。中朝人民战士依依话别时，志愿军上等兵李伯禹拥抱着人民军上士班长柳三禄，把他参加志愿军时未婚妻给他绣的一对花枕头，送了一个给柳三禄，他在枕头上写着：“一个枕头留朝鲜，一个枕头带身边，战友如同亲兄弟，中朝友谊万万年。”（附图片）
