Bachu County, Xinjiang, Criticizes the Ideology of Waiting for Mechanization
Combined Old and New Double Plows Deeply Plow the Land

(Our report) Bachu County in southern Xinjiang is criticizing the ideology of waiting for mechanization, adopting a combination of old and new plows and a double-plow deep plowing method to vigorously transform the land.

Bachu County is a poor county inhabited by Uyghur farmers. Before last year, cultivation was very extensive, with the old-fashioned "two oxen pulling a plow" dominating. During the Great Leap Forward in agriculture this spring, the county promoted more than 4,000 new-style farm tools, changing the backward state of plowing and other cultivation that had existed for thousands of years. As a result, grain and cotton are growing luxuriantly, and the yield per unit area is expected to double compared to last year. In order to strive for an even greater harvest next year, the county recently discussed the experience of Changge County in Henan Province in deep plowing the land. At first, many cadres believed that to reach the deep plowing depth of one chi five cun (approximately 50 cm) in Changge County, there was no other way except to use a "kantu man" (a local tool similar to a trowel) and tractors. They also believed that digging with a "kantu man" was very inefficient, and they would have to wait until next year to use tractors, so the current deep plowing would be very difficult. Under the situation of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and the Great Leap Forward across the country, the majority here opposed this ideology of waiting for mechanization. They proposed the method of deep plowing with double plows in a discussion meeting, requesting a trial implementation and promotion.

On July 4, the Bachu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an on-site meeting of the Sixth District Party Committee Secretary in the Sixth District to trial implement deep plowing with double plows. The trial area was a winter wheat field that had just been harvested. At the beginning of the trial, the new-style plows (double-wheel double-furrow plows, No. 2 and No. 3 single-body plows, and No. 5 plows) were allowed to plow first, and then the old plows were used to plow again in the furrows. As a result, the plowing depth reached 35 cm, with a maximum depth of 45 cm. After the trial, a discussion was held. Everyone believed that if the soil plowing tool was lengthened, the depth could reach 50 cm, which is about 10 cm deeper than plowing with a tractor and more than ten times more efficient than digging with a "kantu man." At the same time, each commune in Bachu has a set of new farm tools and a set of old farm tools, making promotion very convenient. Now, in addition to reclaiming 100,000 mu of wasteland, all 150,000 mu of winter wheat land this year have been deeply plowed using this method. After autumn, the other 400,000 mu of autumn farmland will also be deeply plowed once using this method. (Ke Xian)

    新疆巴楚县批判等待机械化思想
    新旧结合双套犁深翻土地
    本报讯　新疆南部的巴楚县批判等待机械化思想，采用新旧犁相结合，双套犁深耕法，大闹土地翻身。
    巴楚县是个维吾尔族农民聚居的贫苦的县份。去年以前，耕作还非常粗放，旧式农具二牛抬杠占着统治地位，今年春天农业大跃进中，全县推广了四千多部新式农具，犁地和其他耕作改变了过去千百年来的落后状态，因此粮棉生长茂密，单产预计可比去年增加一倍。为了争取明年更大的丰收，最近全县讨论了河南长葛县深翻土地的经验。开始，有不少干部认为犁地深度要达到长葛县的一尺五，除用砍土镘（当地一种类似镘头的工具）和拖拉机外，是没有别的办法的。而他们又认为用砍土镘挖地效率很低，要用拖拉机，只有等到明年以后，当前深耕困难很大。在学先进、赶先进、全国大跃进的形势下，这里多数人反对这种等待机械化思想，他们在座谈会中提出了双套犁深耕的办法，要求试办推广。
    7月4日，中共巴楚县委会在第六区召开了区委书记现场会议，试办双套犁深耕。试办土地是一块刚收过的冬麦地。试办开始，先让新式犁（双轮双铧犁、二三号单体犁、五号犁）走在前面犁，然后再用旧犁在犁沟里再犁。结果犁地的深度达到三十五公分，最深处四十五公分。试办后进行了讨论，大家认为：如果将土犁工具改长一些，深度可达五十公分，比拖拉机耕地深十公分左右，比砍土镘挖地效率高十几倍。同时，巴楚每个社都拥有一套新农具和一套旧农具，推广也非常方便。现在，全县除开荒十万亩外，今年十五万亩冬麦地都采用了这种办法深耕，秋后，其他四十多万亩秋田土地也采用这种办法深耕一次。　（克现）
