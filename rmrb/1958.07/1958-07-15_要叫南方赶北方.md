　　Make the South Catch Up with the North
　　Kang Zhuo

　　Cross the Yellow River, cross the Yangtze,
　　Cross the Yangtze, rush to the heavens.
　　Hold high the red flag of the General Line,
　　Make the South catch up with the North!

This is the slogan just proposed by the Dasi Gezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Xushui, Hebei. Because of the slogan's poetic quality and ambition, because of the measures taken to realize this ambition, and because of the combination of revolutionary romanticism and realism manifested in these aspects, the cooperative's director, at the county-wide rally held in their village a few days ago to celebrate the Party's birthday "July 1st" and to pledge to fight drought—a rally of ten thousand people—the fiery atmosphere suddenly went silent for a brief moment. Then, an enthusiastic response and raised arms followed like a storm, and the slogan immediately spread throughout Xushui.

Dasi Gezhuang is an agricultural cooperative of over one hundred households. The cooperative has about eight hundred mu of land, and last year only harvested 300,000 jin of grain. But after the Great Leap Forward began last winter, they set their plan at 2,000 jin per mu. More recently, encouraged by the General Line, they have been continuously increasing their goals wave upon wave, from guaranteeing 3,000, 5,000, all the way to striving for over 10,000 jin per mu when the above slogan was proposed.

These plans, as village Party branch secretary Yan Yiru said, are completely well-founded and ironclad. During the wheat harvest, I and the cooperative's accountant carefully calculated the accounts. The cooperative has fifty-eight brick wells and five newly drilled machine wells. The self-bred and continuously increasing number of pigs has reached three hundred. There are also sixty-four rapid composting pits producing forty million jin of fertilizer annually, and they can buy chemical fertilizer. This year, the wheat was watered six to ten times. When the wheat needed topdressing in the spring, because the supply of coarse fertilizer was temporarily unavailable and chemical fertilizer could not be bought, the cooperative director took the lead in dismantling old houses to send to the fields, and the accountant took the lead in vacating good houses for the families whose houses were being dismantled, thus dismantling millions of jin of fertilizer to save the wheat. This has resulted in an average wheat yield of over 754 jin per mu, exceeding last year's high-yield areas; making the entire seven hundred mu of summer harvest crops yield a total of 430,000 jin; making this year's one wheat crop equal three wheat crops of last year, exceeding last year's total annual yield by nearly half. In addition, they plan to plant 500 mu of Chinese yams. Last year, each mu received 10,000 jin of fertilizer, yielding 8,500 jin; this year, the fertilizer is doubled, so even if the yield is 10,000 jin per mu, with four jin of yam equaling one jin of grain, this would be one million several hundred thousand jin of grain. And the General Line happened to be transmitted during the days of the wheat harvest, so the cooperative members rejoiced all night, and simply proposing to plant more Chinese yams yielding 40,000 jin per mu immediately increased the entire per-mu yield target from 2,000 to 3,000.

Of course, there are other bases for increased production. Yan Yiru said:

"The biggest basis is politics. We must resolutely listen to the Party's words. The Party tells us to densely plant, to eliminate individual farming and implement intercropping, and we must do it boldly, only allowing surpassing, not allowing perfunctory compliance! With just this point, you are guaranteed to have whatever you want."

Yan Yiru is about forty years old. Tall, broad-shouldered, with shiny dark skin. He is decisive in his words and actions. He also told me about "politics." He said that, for example, when they wanted to achieve a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin, someone named Yan Lao Zhi shouted: "Well, you can just take off the weight on the scale when weighing the grain, and you're sure to reach it!" The cooperative members then used accounting to refute him in a large debate. And that's not all. Precisely because someone opposed this and opposed that, the cooperative members became even more energized and motivated after refuting them. Just take a sixty-year-old woman, Xie Guozhen, who, upon seeing the cadres, urged them to engage in the Great Leap Forward and the great battle, saying that if anyone slacked off, she would debate them. During the drought resistance, she watched the waterwheel day and night, and when the wheat was being weighed, she insisted that Yan Lao Zhi go and see if the weight on the scale had been removed. In addition, I saw her on stage at the "July 1st" celebration a few days ago, saying that she was a supporter of the Great Leap Forward from the start, that she was old but her heart was not, that she wanted to always be a red flag, not only making leaps forward in production, but also dancing…

"Go and see the cooperative members' political thought," Yan Yiru said to me more than once, "that is the biggest, biggest basis for increased production!"

Here, we have only talked about a per-mu yield of 3,000. On June 19th, the cooperative director attended the special district's celebration meeting, and quickly made a long-distance call back to the cooperative on the newly installed telephone, saying that their cooperative had won first prize, and reported the plans and measures of Anguo to achieve a wheat yield of 5,000 jin per mu and Ding County to achieve a Chinese yam yield of 160,000 jin per mu. Thus, Yan Yiru, in the Party branch and among the cooperative members, discussed further tapping potential, and based on the county Party committee's opinion, decided to, within twenty days, resist drought and sow seeds on one hand, and carry out large-scale land leveling and tomb relocation on the other, to achieve comprehensive gardening, standardization, and specification; and once again pulled Zheng Jintian to calculate the accounts, calculating a per-mu yield of 5,000 jin. And this plan further encouraged the cooperative members, who did not want to relocate the tombs, all advocating flattening the tombs into piles; it also encouraged several hundred people from county-level government offices and schools to voluntarily come and help them rush to level the land.

In two days and two nights, the land leveling and tomb flattening were all completed. The six to seven hundred mu of land south of the village instantly turned into a sea cut by machines. Inside the sea and along the edges, some river dike-like ridges and irrigation furrows were built, just like the village street poetry described: "Furrows in a straight line, land as flat as a mirror." On the mirror, many straight, endless ridges were raised, and on the ridges were planted single-row double-bank or four-row up and down one ridge of Chinese yam seedlings, all with the specifications and standards of a top-quality vegetable garden. All large and small paths in the fields were eliminated, and three new highways were built. Five machines were constantly drawing water from the machine wells, and two tractors were deeply plowing the last part of the wheat stubble fields. Once, when I was digging deep into the soil next to a furrow, Yan Yiru suddenly ran over and pulled me away, and secretly told me that he planned to eliminate Chinese yams with a yield of less than 40,000 jin per mu, and cultivate Chinese yams with 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu and a harvest of 100,000 jin, and also cultivate several mu of biogas Chinese yams with a per-mu yield of 270,000 jin as reported in the People's Daily, cultivate millet with large-ridge dense planting and one-inch plant spacing with a per-mu yield of 20,000 jin, and cultivate Xushui's special large cabbages weighing two hundred jin each…

"And build three more machine wells!" Yan Yiru grabbed the small cloth shirt draped over his shoulder and waved it, and said, "The county asks for one machine well to ensure two to three hundred mu of land, we'll make it one well ensure one hundred mu! Whether it's drought or not, I've forgotten about it raining! I want to make it so that even if there is not a single cloud in the sky, it rains thoroughly, from the ground up!"

I was stunned for a long time. I remembered that this area hadn't had a thorough rain in over a year, but the thorough rain was right at hand…

Yan Yiru brought Zheng Jintian to calculate the accounts again. He calculated that the per-mu yield could reach 15,000 jin! At this time, the cooperative director returned from the special district covered in dust, and rushed to the fields to anxiously tell us that he had calculated the accounts at the special district meeting, and raised the cooperative's plan to strive for a per-mu yield of 10,000.

"Right! That's how we'll do it!" Yan Yiru waved his small cloth shirt again, and said, "We can't just cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River! We'll strive for 10,000, and make the South learn from us too!"

The cooperative members' meeting determined the final number, and at the same time proposed the slogan "Hold high the red flag of the General Line, make the South catch up with the North," and immediately began a new round of leaping forward day and night with the force of a level twelve gale, and also wrote more new slogans on the walls. One of them read:

The General Line's east wind travels ten thousand miles,
Xushui County's red flag covers the sky!

July 3, 1958, in Xushui.

### 要叫南方赶北方

专栏：跃进之歌

    要叫南方赶北方
    康濯
    跨过黄河跨长江，　跨过长江奔天上。
    高举红旗总路线，　要叫南方赶北方！
    这是河北徐水大寺各庄农业社刚刚提出的口号。由于这个口号的诗意和雄心，由于实现这个雄心的措施，由于这几个方面所表现的革命的浪漫主义和现实主义的结合，就使得这个社的社长在几天以前，在他们村召开的全县人民向党的生日“七一”报喜和抗旱誓师的万人大会上刚刚提出这个口号，那火热熏天的会场突然间竟呆楞得哑静了一小会儿工夫，紧跟着可就是狂风暴雨的纷纷响应和振臂高呼，并且也就这样地立时便把这个口号传遍了整个的徐水。
    大寺各庄是个一百多户的农业社。全社八百来亩土地，去年只收获三十万斤粮食。但在去年冬天大跃进开始以后，他们就把规划订到了亩产两千斤。而最近更在总路线的鼓舞下一浪一浪地继长增高，从保证三千、五千一直长到了提出上述口号时候的争取亩产万斤以上。
    这些规划正像村支部书记阎义如说的那样，是完完全全的有根有据和铁板钉钉。麦收时节，我和社里的会计算过细账。全社有五十八眼砖井和新打成的五眼机井。自繁自养和不断增加的猪只已经达到三百口。还有年产四千万斤肥料的六十四个快速积肥坑，并能买化学肥料。今年小麦浇了六水到十水。春天小麦正要追肥，因为一时供不上粗肥和买不到化肥，社长就带头拆下旧房往地里送，会计就带头腾出好房让拆房户住，这就拆下几百万斤肥料救了小麦。这也就使得今年小麦平均亩产都超过了去年的丰产地，达到七百五十四斤；使得整个七百亩夏收庄稼一共拿到四十三万斤；使得今年比去年，一麦顶三麦，一季就超过去年全年将近半倍。此外，计划种山药五百亩。去年每亩万斤肥，收八千五百斤；今年肥料翻一翻，就算亩产万斤，四斤山药一斤粮，这便是一百几十万斤粮食。而总路线又恰好在小麦丰收的日子里传了下来，于是，社员们欢腾了一夜，并且只不过提出了多种点亩产四万斤的山药，马上就把整个亩产指标从两千长到了三千。
    当然还有别的增产根据。阎义如说过：
    “最大的根据是政治。得坚决听党的话。党叫密植，叫消灭土地单干和实行间作，就都得大胆地做，只许超过，不许支应！光这一点呀，你就保险要什么有什么。”
    阎义如四十来岁。大个儿，宽肩膀，一身乌油发亮的皮肉。说话办事都是立竿见影。他还给我说了一个“政治”。他说，比如要搞亩产两千，有个阎老志就叫喊：“那呀，粮食过秤的工夫把秤锤一摘，准能达到！”社员们就通过大辩论，用算账辩倒了他。这还不算。正因为有人反对这反对那，社员们在辩倒了人家以后也就气势更大和干劲更足。单说一个六十岁的老大娘谢国珍，见了干部就让人家大跃进大鏖战，说是谁若松劲她就要辩论谁。她在抗旱当中连明带夜看水车，在小麦过秤的时候非要叫阎老志去看看秤锤有没有摘下。此外，我还看到她在前几天向“七一”献礼的大会上登台讲话，说她起根儿就是大跃进，她人老心不老，他要永远当一面红旗，不光生产跃进，要跳舞都能跳……
    “你去看看社员们的政治思想，”阎义如不止一次地对我说，“那就是最大最大的增产根据啊！”
    这里还只说到了亩产三千。6月19日，社长出席专区的庆功大会，很快就给社里刚安上的电话挂回了长途，说是他们社得了一等奖，并报告了安国出现亩产五千斤的小麦以及定县亩产十六万斤山药的计划和措施。于是，阎义如就在支部和社员当中酝酿再挖潜力，又根据县委的意见，决定在二十天内一面抗旱播种，一面大搞土地平整和迁坆，实现全面的园田化、规格化和标准化；并且再一次拉住郑金田算账，算出了个亩产五千斤。而这个规划又鼓舞得社员们谁都不愿意迁坆，都主张平坆堆；也鼓舞得县里的机关学校自动来了好几百人，帮他们突击平整土地。
    两天两夜，全部完成了土地的平整和平坆堆。村南的六七百亩土地，刹时变作机器切成的一片大海。大海里面和边缘上都打了一些河堤似的地埂和灌溉垅道，真像村里街头诗描写的那样：“垅沟一条线，地平如镜面。”镜面上又挑起直溜溜望不到头的许多畦埂，畦埂上栽了单埂双行的或是一条埂道上下四行的山药秧，全都是上等菜园子一般的规格和标准。地里大道小道全部消灭，另修了三条大马路。五台机器在机井上不停地提水，两台拖拉机在最后一部分麦茬地里深耕。有一回，我正在垅道旁边深掘土地，阎义如忽然跑过来把我拉走，同时就悄悄密密地告诉我，说是他计划要消灭亩产四万斤往下的山药，另搞每亩上粪十万斤和收获十万斤的山药，再搞几亩人民日报登的亩产二十七万斤的沼气山药，搞大畦密植和株距一寸的亩产两万斤的谷子，搞二百斤一颗的徐水特产大白菜……
    “还再打三眼机井！”阎义如抓过披在肩头的小布衫一扬，又说，“县里叫一眼机井保二三百亩地，咱们来它个一眼保一百亩！什么旱不旱的，我就忘了它下雨这回事！我要叫天无朵云下透雨，从地底往地上下！”
    我听得呆楞了半天。我想起这一带已经有一年多没下过透雨，可原来透雨就在手边……
    阎义如又把郑金田找来算账。竟算出亩产可达一万五千斤！正在这时，社长带着满身尘土从专区回来，赶到地里就紧张地告诉我们，说是他在专区会议上算了算账，把社里的规划提到了争取亩产一万。
    “对！就这么办！”阎义如又把小布衫一扬，说道，“不能光是过黄河过长江！咱们就搞它个争取一万，也叫南方跟咱们学学！”
    社员大会确定了最后这个数目，同时就提出了“高举红旗总路线，要叫南方赶北方”的口号，并且马上开始了十二级大风一般的新的日夜跃进，还在墙头写上了更多的新的口号。其中有一条这样写着：
    总路线东风万里，
    徐水县红旗盖天！
        1958年7月3日于徐水。
