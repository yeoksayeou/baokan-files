To prevent world conflict and stop the expansion of imperialist aggression, the Soviet government has proposed to the United States, Britain, France, and India that a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council, attended by the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, be held on July 28 to quickly find a correct solution to maintain peace in the Middle East and the world, and ease international tensions. This is a major step taken by the Soviet Union, a loyal friend of the Middle Eastern people and a great pillar of world peace, to strive for peace.

At a critical moment when American and British imperialism invaded the Middle East and seriously threatened world peace, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, made an urgent appeal to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and India on July 19, suggesting that a meeting of the heads of government of these countries, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, be convened to immediately take measures to stop the military conflict that had already begun in the Middle East. This suggestion immediately received warm support and response from all peace-loving people and many countries around the world, forming a tremendous force. Among the governments of the relevant countries, Indian Prime Minister Nehru was the first to reply on the 20th, expressing his agreement with the Soviet government's opinion and his willingness to participate in the proposed meeting. Subsequently, French Prime Minister de Gaulle also expressed his support for the principle of holding such a meeting in his reply on the 22nd, but believed that the Middle East issue should continue to be debated in the United Nations, and if these debates failed, then a way should be found to convene the heads of government meeting proposed by the Soviet Union. The heads of the U.S. and British governments, in their respective replies issued on the 22nd, while trying their best to distort the facts and defend the aggressive acts of the U.S. and Britain, had to express their willingness to participate in a heads of government meeting held within the framework of the United Nations Security Council under the pressure of the peace aspirations of the people and public opinion of various countries.

At this moment, when the safety of the people of the world is at stake, in order to hold the summit meeting as soon as possible, the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers wrote replies to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and India on the 23rd, expressing his willingness to participate in a special meeting of the Security Council attended by the heads of government of the five countries to discuss the current situation in the Middle East. Khrushchev also advocated that it was necessary for Indian Prime Minister Nehru to participate in this meeting, and that the governments of relevant Arab countries should also be included. Khrushchev also suggested that this meeting be held in New York on July 28.

Obviously, the Soviet government's proposal proceeds from the urgent need and desire to stop aggression and maintain peace. Peace-loving people all over the world welcome and support the Soviet government's proposal, and hope that a special meeting of the Security Council attended by the heads of government of the five countries will be held as soon as possible in accordance with the Soviet proposal.

The joint aggression of American and British imperialism against Middle Eastern countries has seriously threatened peace in the Middle East and the world. And the American and British aggressors, disregarding the wishes of the people of the world, are actively preparing to expand their aggression after sending troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan. In recent days, the troops, ships, and aircraft of the American and British aggressors have been continuously gathering in the Middle East. The aggressors' continued large-scale gathering of armed forces is not only a naked war threat to the Middle Eastern countries, but also a dangerous act of playing with fire on a world scale. Arab countries that are determined to defend their national independence and socialist countries that love peace will not tolerate the肆行aggression of American and British imperialism. Once the aggressors attempt to expand their aggressive actions, it will easily cause an unstoppable and ever-expanding war. At this serious moment, the Soviet Union's call to extinguish the flames already ignited by the aggressors at the very beginning is fully in line with the wishes and interests of all peace-loving people around the world.

War or peace? This is the most acute and urgent question in the current international situation. The American and British aggressors are flaunting their power in front of the Middle Eastern people, boasting about their atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, but the Middle Eastern people who are determined to safeguard their national independence will not be intimidated. President Nasser said in his speech in Damascus on July 18: "Threats and fleets will never scare us, and atomic bombs will never scare us, because fleets and atomic bombs will disappear and turn to ashes in the face of Arab nationalism." Not only do the people of the Middle Eastern countries have this heroic determination, but also the people of the world who love peace and freedom have taken action to resolutely oppose the American and British imperialist aggressors. And more importantly, there is also the mainstay of the contemporary peace cause, the socialist camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union, which resolutely maintains peace. After the American and British imperialists invaded Lebanon and Jordan, they have fallen into an inextricable dilemma under the resolute opposition of the Arab and even the world's people. Isn't it time for the aggressors to rein in their horses at the edge of the precipice?

The heads of the U.S. and British governments expressed their willingness to sit down and negotiate in their replies to Khrushchev's letters, which is a good sign in any case. However, this is far from saying that the aggressors have willingly accepted peace and abandoned their aggressive ambitions. In particular, the American and British invading troops have not yet withdrawn from Lebanon and Jordan, and they are still playing various conspiracies to legalize their aggressive acts, which cannot be tolerated. The common desire of peace-loving people all over the world is that the American and British invading troops must withdraw from the Middle East. Khrushchev also pointed out in his letter to Eisenhower on July 19: "In today's situation, there can only be one correct solution: the occupying forces immediately withdraw from the Middle East, giving the people of each country in this region the opportunity to decide their own destiny." This is the fundamental way to eliminate the dangerous situation caused by the aggression of American and British imperialism against Middle Eastern countries, and it is also a test of whether the American and British governments truly accept peace.

The actions taken by the Soviet Union to maintain peace have achieved preliminary results. However, peace-loving people in all countries must be vigilant and continue to strengthen the struggle against the American and British aggressors. Only by continuously strengthening their unity and efforts, being vigilant against all kinds of conspiracies of imperialism, and carrying out a resolute struggle against the aggressors can the people of the Middle East and the people of all countries who love peace force the aggressors to stop their adventurous actions.

### 制止侵略、争取和平的重大步骤

    制止侵略、争取和平的重大步骤
    为了防止世界发生冲突，制止帝国主义侵略的扩大，苏联政府已经向美、英、法、印四国提出于7月28日举行有苏、美、英、法和印度五国政府首脑参加的联合国安全理事会特别会议，以便迅速找到正确的解决办法，来维护中东和世界的和平，缓和国际紧张局势。这是中东人民的忠实友人、世界和平的伟大支柱——苏联为争取和平而采取的一项重大步骤。
    在美英帝国主义侵入中近东，严重威胁世界和平的危急时刻，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫曾于7月19日向美英法印政府发出迫切的呼吁，建议召开有联合国秘书长参加的这些国家的政府首脑会议，以便立即采取措施，停止在中近东已经开始的军事冲突。这个建议立即得到全世界一切爱好和平的人民和许多国家的热烈支持和响应，形成了巨大的力量。有关国家的政府中，印度总理尼赫鲁首先在20日提出答复，表示同意苏联政府的意见，并愿意参加所建议的会议。接着，法国总理戴高乐在22日的复信中，也表示赞同举行这样一个会议的原则，但认为关于中近东的问题应该在联合国继续进行辩论，如果这些辩论失败，再设法召开苏联所建议的政府首脑会议。而美英两国政府首脑在22日分别发出的复信中，虽竭力颠倒黑白地替美英两国的侵略行为辩护，但是在各国人民和舆论要求和平愿望的压力下，也不得不表示愿意参加在联合国安全理事会范围内举行的政府首脑会议。
    在这个全世界人民安危所系的时刻，为了尽快地举行首脑会议，苏联部长会议主席在23日分别给美英法印四国政府首脑写了回信，表示愿意参加有五国政府首脑出席的安理会特别会议，来讨论目前中近东的局势问题。赫鲁晓夫并主张这个会议有必要让印度总理尼赫鲁参加，同时应当吸收有关阿拉伯国家政府参加。赫鲁晓夫还建议，这个会议于7月28日在纽约举行。
    很明显，苏联政府的主张是从制止侵略，维护和平的迫切需要和愿望出发的。全世界爱好和平的人民欢迎和支持苏联政府的主张，并且希望按照苏联的建议，尽早召开有五国政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议。
    美英帝国主义合伙侵略中东国家，已使中东和世界和平遭到了严重的威胁。而美英侵略者不顾世界人民的愿望，在派兵侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦之后，还在积极准备扩大侵略。连日以来，美英侵略者的军队、舰只和飞机不断地向中东地区集结。侵略者这样大规模地继续集结武装力量，这不仅是对中东国家的赤裸裸的战争威胁，而且是一种世界范围的危险的玩火行动。坚决保卫自己民族独立的阿拉伯国家和爱好和平的社会主义国家是不会容忍美英帝国主义肆行侵略的。侵略者一旦企图把他们的侵略行动扩大，就会很容易引起一场无法制止的、不断扩大的战争。在这个严重的时刻，苏联呼吁把已经由侵略者燃起的火焰，在它开始的时候就设法扑灭，这是完全符合于全世界爱好和平人民的愿望和利益的。
    战争呢，还是和平呢？这是当前国际形势下的最尖锐最迫切的问题。美英侵略者在中东人民面前张牙舞爪，吹嘘他们的原子弹、氢弹，但是坚决维护自己的民族独立的中东人民是吓不倒的。纳赛尔总统7月18日在大马士革发表的演说中就曾说：“威胁和舰队决吓不倒我们，原子弹也决吓不倒我们，因为舰队和原子弹将在阿拉伯民族主义面前消失和化为灰烬。”不止是中东各国人民有这种豪迈的决心，而且全世界爱好和平和自由的人民也已经行动起来，坚决反对美英帝国主义侵略者。而更重要的是，坚决维护和平的还有当代和平事业的中坚——以强大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营。而美英帝国主义侵入黎巴嫩和约旦之后，在阿拉伯以至全世界人民坚决的反对下，已经陷入不能自拔、进退两难的处境。难道现在还不是侵略者悬崖勒马的时候吗？
    美英政府首脑在答复赫鲁晓夫的信件中表示愿意坐下来谈判，这无论如何是一个好的现象。但是，这远不能说侵略者已经甘心接受和平、放弃他们的侵略野心了。特别是，美英侵略军队还没有从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出，他们还在玩弄各种阴谋来使他们的侵略行为合法化，这是不能容许的。全世界爱好和平的人民的共同愿望是美英侵略军队必须撤出中东。赫鲁晓夫在7月19日给艾森豪威尔的信中也曾指出：“在今天的情况下，最正确的解决办法只可能有一个：占领军立即撤出中近东，给予这一个地区各国人民自己决定自己命运的机会”。这是消除由于美英帝国主义侵略中东国家而造成的危险局势的根本办法，同时也是美英政府是否真正接受和平的一个考验。
    苏联为维护和平而采取的行动，已取得了初步的成果。但是，各国爱好和平的人民还必须提高警惕，并继续加强反对美英侵略者的斗争。中东人民和各国爱好和平的人民只有不断加强自己的团结和努力，警惕帝国主义的各种阴谋，并对侵略者进行坚决的斗争，才有可能迫使侵略者停止他们的冒险行动。
