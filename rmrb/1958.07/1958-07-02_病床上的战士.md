    A Soldier on the Sickbed

    In Shanghai's Luwan District, there is a street-level Party branch secretary named Zhang Zengfu. As a child, he contracted bone tuberculosis and, lacking the money for treatment, became disabled. He has been bedridden for twenty-two years now. However, thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, he has overcome his physical disability and pain, and perseveres in Party work.

    The members of the street branch are mostly probationary Party members who have recently joined the Party, with a relatively low level of political understanding. However, Zhang Zengfu knows that the neighborhood is an important socialist position, and it is necessary to improve the level of these Party members in order to defend this position. Therefore, he tirelessly discusses ideology and work with the Party members, helping them to solve various problems. At the same time, he also gives them Party lectures. Sometimes, his waist hurts so much that he is covered in sweat, but he still insists on continuing to speak. Some comrades advised him to take a rest, but he said, "As long as you are willing to come and listen, I am happy in my heart. When I am happy, I don't feel the pain!"

    Although Zhang Zengfu cannot walk, he often sits in a rattan wheelchair and asks others to push him to visit the masses. Once, he heard that a female comrade had encountered difficulties in her street work, and that the support she received from various quarters was insufficient. On a snowy day, he sat in his wheelchair and went to the district people's committee office to report the situation and discuss solutions. After leaving the office, he personally went to the comrade's home to encourage her to overcome her difficulties and do a good job.

    The spirit of Paul constantly encourages and inspires him. In his spare time, he is rushing to write a literary work entitled "My Experience." Zhang Zengfu's struggle history before and after liberation will be truthfully reflected in this book. (Shang Jiewen) (Attached picture)

    病床上的战士
    上海市卢湾区有个街道党支部书记，他的名字叫张增富。他在少年时得了骨痨，因为没有钱医治，成了残废。到现在，他已经在床上躺了二十二年了。但由于党的培养和教育，他战胜了生理上的残废和痛苦，坚持着党的工作。
    街道支部的成员，大都是新入党的预备党员，政治水平较低。但，张增富知道里弄是一块重要的社会主义阵地，必须提高这些党员的水平，才能坚守住阵地。于是，他就不厌其烦地同党员谈思想，谈工作，帮助他们解决各种各样的问题。同时，还给他们上党课。有时，他腰疼得厉害，满头大汗，还是坚持着讲下去。有些同志劝他休息一下，他说：“只要你们肯来听讲，我心里就高兴。一高兴，就不觉得疼了！”
    张增富虽然不能走路，还经常坐着藤车子，请别人推着到群众中去访问。一次，他听说一个女同志在街道工作上碰到了困难，各方面对她的支持又不够。在一个下雪天他便坐着车子到区人民委员会的办事处去反映情况，商讨解决办法。从办事处出来，他又亲自到那个同志的家里，鼓励她克服困难，搞好工作。
    保尔的精神，不断鼓舞着他，激励着他。工作之余，他正在赶写着一本题为“我的体验”的文艺作品。张增富解放前后的斗争历史，在这本书中，将得到如实的反映。　（尚解文）（附图片）
