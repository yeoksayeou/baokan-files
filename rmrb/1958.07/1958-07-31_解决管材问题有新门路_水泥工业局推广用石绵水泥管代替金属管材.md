    New Approaches to Solving Pipe Problems
    Cement Industry Bureau Promotes the Use of Asbestos Cement Pipes to Replace Metal Pipes
    (Our Newspaper) To promote the rapid development of the asbestos cement products industry, the Cement Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering recently held an on-site meeting in Shenyang to summarize and promote the experience of the Shenyang and Jilin asbestos cement products factories in trial-producing asbestos cement pipes.
    The asbestos cement products industry is a relatively young and weakly-established industry in our country. The workers of the Shenyang and Jilin asbestos cement products factories, without engineers and lacking experience, displayed a spirit of originality and successfully trial-produced asbestos cement pipes of various diameters in April of this year. Scientific research departments have tested these pipes and proved that they can completely replace metal pipes and be widely used in industry, agriculture, and urban construction as pipelines for water supply, drainage, gas, oil, and cables. This is of great significance for solving the problem of insufficient metal pipe supply and reducing project costs.
    The meeting studied the issue of actively developing the asbestos cement products industry. Representatives from various provinces and cities believe that investing in the construction of asbestos cement products factories requires little investment and yields great results. Shenyang and Jilin have provided experience. At the same time, our country is rich in asbestos resources, and cement production will also increase, which provides favorable conditions for the asbestos cement products industry to flourish throughout the country.

    解决管材问题有新门路
    水泥工业局推广用石绵水泥管代替金属管材
    本报讯　为了促使石绵水泥制品工业迅速发展，建筑工程部水泥工业管理局最近在沈阳召开现场会议，总结和推广了沈阳、吉林两石绵水泥制品厂试制成石绵水泥管的经验。
    石绵水泥制品工业在我国还是一门历史不长、基础薄弱的工业。沈阳和吉林两个石绵水泥制品厂的职工，在没有工程师、缺乏经验的情况下，发挥独创精神，在今年4月份试制成功了大小口径不同的石绵水泥管。这种管道，经科学研究部门试验证明，完全可以代替金属管材，作为给水、排水、煤气、石油、电缆等方面的管道，广泛应用于工农业和城市建设事业。这对解决金属管材供应不足问题、降低工程造价都有重大意义。
    会议研究了积极发展石绵水泥制品工业的问题。各省市代表认为，建设石绵水泥制品厂投资不多，收效很大；沈阳和吉林两地已提供了经验；同时，我国石绵资源丰富，水泥产量也将增加，这就提供了有利条件，可以使石绵水泥制品工业在全国开花。
