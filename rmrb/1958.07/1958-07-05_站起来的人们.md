    The People Who Stood Up
    Guo Xianhong, Workshop Director of Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory

    That famous old expert, a Doctor of Physics, from a certain capitalist country, on the eve of his return to his country, sent a long letter of thanks to our factory from Shanghai, which contained the following passage:

    "Please forgive a scientist, the young workshop director and all the hardworking workers, for having doubted their hands because of praising those exquisite products, and doubted the precision machine tools they made; and for some impolite behavior arising from this. I once again ask for forgiveness, and am willing to bring all the good impressions of China to the people of my country."

    Amidst the deafening roar of various machine tools, I finished reading the letter forwarded by the chief engineer: the old expert's shocked appearance when he visited the factory a month ago clearly reappeared before my eyes.

    In the morning, I habitually went to the "stamping" group. It wasn't that I, the workshop director, was being biased, nor was it that I was nostalgic for the machine tool I used to use. I always felt that "stamping" was one of the most important parts of the electricity meter, the heart of the electricity meter. Therefore, I couldn't sit securely in the office without making a trip there every day.

    Just then, the chief engineer came in with several guests in suits.

    Walking side by side with the chief engineer was an elderly man with receding hair and a small mustache. He held a cane and had a camera hanging on his shoulder. Seeing this outfit, I wondered: what does he do? He is probably not a "professor," but definitely an expert.

    The chief engineer said to the professor:

    "This is the director of our workshop."

    Based on past experience, anyone who comes to the workshop with the chief engineer has been in contact with the factory in advance and is a well-known figure. I hurriedly extended a welcoming hand.

    Knowing that I was the person in charge of the workshop, the other party slowly took off his white gloves, shook my hand lightly, and then withdrew it. His hand, like his diamond ring, was cold.

    "So, a professor has come?" I thought, "He will at most wander around for three minutes and then leave."

    He didn't leave as quickly as I thought. He walked slowly, step by step, looking around as he walked, passing by various machine tools from Budapest and Leningrad; when he reached the Chinese-made machine tools, his movements became even slower, and his eyes intently watched the operating mother machine.

    The extremely complex "stampings" were being produced at a speed of two impacts per second by the skilled hands of the workers. The professor's gaze followed the workers' rapid operations even more intently.

    Eh! Could it be that the professor is particularly interested in the domestically produced mother machine and this part of the electricity meter? As I was thinking this, the professor went from standing to bending down to take a closer look; his cane also changed position, no longer being held but rather tucked under his arm.

    "Laymen watch the excitement, experts watch the details." He not only knew how to watch the details, but also listened to the sound of the machine tool running and the impact of the "die."

    "Like this, producing 25,000 per shift?" the professor said, with a bit of a stutter, like a Shanghai accent, yet also like a northern Jiangsu accent.

    "That's right," I replied, admiring the professor's estimation.

    "What is the total output of each set of dies?" the professor asked again.

    "On average, 800,000 to 1 million impacts."

    The professor showed a satisfied expression, and casually picked up a freshly stamped "stamping," gently touching around it. He was using his sense of touch (if you didn't have years of experience, you wouldn't have this skill!) to measure the size of the burrs and the unevenness. Based on his every move, it was completely clear that he was an old hand, look at his "seeing," "listening," and "touching," it's really not simple, no wonder he has such great pride!

    "What's the next process?" the professor asked me, putting down the "stamping," as if testing a student.

    "Final riveting," I replied, but I thought to myself: "Even if you have a couple of tricks up your sleeve, you're still too arrogant."

    "Final riveting, without cleaning?"

    I said, "Our process stipulates no cleaning, because cleaning is both troublesome and wastes gasoline. As long as cleanliness is maintained, the parts will not be stained with oil."

    The professor shook his head suspiciously and said, "Let me see your final riveting parts."

    We came to the final riveting machine tool together. At this time, the sun had already risen too high. Sunlight shone through the large glass windows, making some objects sparkle. Before I could introduce it, the professor reached out and picked up a freshly riveted "stamping assembly," but he did not look at it immediately; he unhurriedly took out a magnifying glass from his pocket, closed one eye, and carefully examined it. The chief engineer and I unconsciously met eyes, and I saw that the chief engineer's smiling face showed no signs of tension. After the professor looked at several in a row, he took off his gold-rimmed glasses and excitedly shook the chief engineer's hand, saying, "Unbelievable, unbelievable, done so well!"

    "What other serious shortcomings do we have?" the chief engineer asked.

    "This machine tool, is it made in China?"

    The professor said this very softly, but it was like a thunderbolt piercing into my ears. The chief engineer glanced at me. Before he could answer, I pointed to the machine tool and said:

    "Didn't you see the sign on it that says, 'China, Shenyang Machine Tool Factory'?"

    The professor neither looked at the sign again nor expressed anything. He turned to me and said:

    "Your electricity meter parts, the quantity and quality of production are very good, the production of this machine tool is very good!"

    "No, we are chasing after America's 'Westinghouse' and Britain's 'Ferranti'," I said.

    The professor seemed to have new doubts about what I said, so I, according to my habit, drew a schematic diagram on the ground with my hand, showing how to improve. The professor listened, nodding from time to time, probably agreeing with what I said. I had just said that in ten years, or a little longer, we could catch up with Britain in this regard, when he suddenly asked me:

    "Are you an engineer?"

    I shook my head.

    "Then, which university did you graduate from?"

    "I didn't go to university. I was promoted from worker to workshop director."

    What I said was originally a very ordinary sentence, but it shocked him so much that he stared at me carefully for a long time, as if there was an incredible mystery in this specific person, a workshop director who was less than thirty years old... Finally, a faint smile appeared on the professor's old, wrinkled, and fair face:

    "Thank you, Chinese workers, for giving me a profound education."

    After saying that, he nodded politely to the chief engineer again, and left the workshop with large strides. The visit ended just like that.

    This was a month ago. The day after the professor left, I learned from the chief engineer that he was an internationally renowned instrument expert. Twenty years ago, this expert with a degree had also come to the Northeast as a member of a visiting group. He vaguely remembered that on the streets, besides soldiers wearing "national defense" colored military uniforms and merchants wearing gorgeous suits, there were people in tattered clothes, with sallow faces and emaciated bodies, dirty and filthy. "Uncivilized," "sick men of East Asia," and "only able to rely on foreign countries" seemed to be taken for granted at the time. This time he saw our present, so it was no wonder that he had some doubts.

    At the end of the instrument expert's letter, there was this sentence:

    "What Chairman Mao Zedong said is a fact, you Chinese people have truly stood up!"

    Note: "Electricity meter" is an instrument for recording electricity consumption, divided into industrial and civilian types. "Stampings" are made of silicon steel sheets using dies, and a large quantity is used in each electricity meter. "Die" is a tool specifically used for stamping stampings, and each time the die is fixed on the machine tool and impacted, a piece is produced. "Burrs" refer to the flash around the stamped parts. Large burrs mean low quality, and the smaller the burrs, the better. "Final riveting" is the final riveting together of the stampings.

    站起来的人们
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂车间主任　郭先红
    那位某资本主义国家著名的老专家，物理学博士，在他归国的前夕，从上海给我们厂来一封很长的感谢信，其中有这样一段：
    “请那位年轻的车间主任及各位辛勤劳动的工人原谅一个科学家，曾因赞扬那些精制的产品而怀疑了他们的双手，又怀疑了他们制出的那些精密的机床；及由此而产生的一些不礼貌行为。我再一次请求谅解，并愿将在中国的一切良好印象带给我祖国的人民。”
    我在各式机床轰隆隆的响声中，看完了总工程师转来的信：一个月前，那位来厂参观的老专家，震惊的样子，又清晰地出现在眼前。
    早晨，我习惯地来到了“冲片”小组，倒不是我这个车间主任偏心，也不是留恋自己使用过的床子，我总觉着“冲片”是电度表中最主要的零件之一，是电度表的心脏，所以每天我要不到这转游一趟，总不能安安稳稳地坐在办公室里。
    就在这时候，总工程师陪着几位穿着西装的客人，迎面进来了。
    和总工程师并排走着的，是一位虽然留着分发而秃了头顶的老年人，唇上还留着一撮小胡子。他手里拿着文明棍，肩上挂着照像机，我看到这个装扮，便猜度着：他是做什么的呢？大概不是什么“教授”，也一定是位专家。
    总工程师向教授说：
    “这位就是我们这个车间的主任。”
    根据以往的经验，有总工程师陪着到车间来的，都是早和厂部联系过的知名人士，我慌忙地伸出了欢迎的手。
    对方知道我是这个车间的负责人，便慢慢地脱去了白色的手套，轻轻地和我一握，就缩回去了。他的手和他的钻石戒指一样，都是冷冰冰的。
    “那来这么个教授？”我想：“他顶多也不过绕上三分钟就会走的。”
    他并没像我想的那样很快走开。他不紧不慢地一步一步走着，一边走一边看，从来自布达佩斯、列宁格勒的各式机床边走过；到了中国国产的机床前面，动作更缓慢了，双目有神地注视着正在开动的工作母机。
    形状极其复杂的“冲片”随着工人熟练的双手，以每秒冲击两次的速度进行着。教授的目光，也跟着工人的快速操作，而更加聚精会神了。
    咦！难道教授对国产母机，对电度表的这个零件，特别感到兴趣。我正在这样想着，教授由站着看而弯下腰来细瞧了；文明棍也变了位置，不是拿着而是挟着了。
    “外行看热闹，行家看门道”，他不但会看门道，而且倾听起机床的运转声和“冲模”的冲击声。
    “这样的，每班出二万五？”教授说，有些口吃，像上海，又像苏北口音。
    “是这样。”我答，很佩服教授的估计。
    “每套模子的总产量呢？”教授又问。
    “平均八十万到一百万次。”
    教授露出了满意的神情，顺手拿起一片刚冲下来的“冲片”，在四周轻轻地摸着。他是凭触觉（若不是有多年经验，是不会有这一手的！）来衡量毛刺大小和不平度的。根据他的一举一动，完全可以断定他是个老内行，你看他那“看”，“听”“摸”，可真不简单，无怪乎有那么大骄劲！
    “下一道是什么？”教授放下“冲片”像考学生似地向我问。
    “终铆。”我答着，但心里想：“就是有两套儿，也未免太骄傲了。”
    “终铆，不清洗的？”
    我说：“我们的工艺过程规定不清洗，因为清洗既麻烦又浪费汽油，只要保持清洁，部件总是不沾油污的。”
    教授怀疑地摇了摇头说：“我看看你们的终铆件。”
    我们一起来到了终铆工序机床旁，这时，太阳已经升得太高了。阳光透过大玻璃窗，照得一些物件闪闪发光。还没等我介绍，教授伸手拿起一个刚铆好的“冲片组合件”，但他并没有立刻看；不慌不忙地从口袋里拿出一个放大镜，闭起一只眼睛，仔细地端相。我和总工程师的眼光不自觉的碰在了一起，见总工程师微笑的脸上，丝毫也没有带一些紧张的样子。教授一连看了几个之后，摘下了他的金边眼镜，很激动地握着总工程师的手说：“想不到，想不到，干的太好！”
    “我们还有哪些严重缺点？”总工程师问。
    “这机床，中国制的吗？”
    教授这话说的很轻，但它像霹雷一样，贯进了我的耳朵。总工程师瞅我一眼，还没等他来回答，我便指着机床说：
    “您没看见在这上面标写着，
  ‘中国，沈阳机床厂’的牌号吗？”
    教授既没有再看牌号，也没表示什么，转身向我说：
    “你们的电度表零件，生产的数量和质量都很好，这机床的生产很好！”
    “不，我们正在追赶美国的
  ‘西屋’，英国的‘弗兰梯’。”我说。
    教授似乎对我说的话又有了新的怀疑，于是我便按着我的习惯，就地上用手划着怎样改进的示意图。教授听着，并不时地点头，大概是赞同了我讲的话。我刚说到十年，或者再多一点的时间，在这方面就可以赶上英国的时候，他突然问我：
    “你是工程师吗？”
    我摇了摇头。
    “那么，你是从哪个大学毕业的？”
    “我没上过大学，是由工人提作车间主任工作的。”
    我说的本来是句很平常的话，但惊得他呆呆地仔细地看了我好半天，仿佛我这个具体的人，一个不到三十岁的车间主任身上，有着不可思议的神秘……终于在教授那老绉而白净的脸上，露出了一丝微笑：
    “谢谢，中国的工人，给我一次深刻的教育。”
    说罢，又向总工程师很有礼貌地点点头，迈着阔步离开了车间，参观就这样结束了。
    这是一个月以前的事了。教授走后的第二天，我才从总工程师那里知道，他是国际上有名的仪表专家。二十年前，这位得到学位的专家，也曾以参观团成员的身份，来到过东北，他隐约地记得，在大街上，除了穿“国防”色军装的军人，穿华丽西装的商人，就是些衣服褴褛，面黄肌瘦，脏里脏气的人们。“不文明”“东亚病夫”，“只能依靠外国”，好像成为当时的天经地义；这回他又看到了我们的今天，那就难怪他有所怀疑了。
    在仪表专家来信的最后，有这么一句话：
    “毛泽东主席说的，是个事实，你们中国人，真的站起来了！”
    注解：“电度表”是一种记录用电量的仪表，分工业用与民用两种。“冲片”是用矽钢片材料利用冲模冲成，每台电度表用量很大。“冲模”是专门用于冲制冲片用的工具，将冲模固定在机床上每冲击一次即冲出一个活来。“毛刺”是指冲出的零件四周有飞刺，毛刺大质量就低，毛刺越小越好。“终铆”是将冲片最后铆在一起。
