Macmillan's Delaying Tactic
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-power summit to discuss the Middle East issue has been widely endorsed by world public opinion. It has received the active support of India, the United Arab Republic, and other Middle Eastern countries. In addition, within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, many countries believe that a summit should be convened immediately to take measures to stop the military intervention that has already begun. Even the spokesman for the French government has expressed acceptance of the Soviet proposal in principle. This situation has put great pressure on the American and British aggressors. It is very difficult for the United States and Britain to reject the Soviet proposal head-on. It was under these circumstances that the British government responded to the Soviet Union. Macmillan's letter to Khrushchev on the 22nd suggested convening a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government.

Subsequently, London newspapers frantically publicized that, until noon on the 22nd, the United States had been taking a rigid and negative attitude towards the Soviet proposal. It was only due to Britain's initiative that Washington changed its position and agreed to convene a "special meeting of the Security Council." This deliberate hype is clearly an attempt to raise the profile of the British plan so that it can find a market in some North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and Commonwealth countries. The "Daily Mail" report revealed the truth of the matter, saying: "There is no doubt that when Lloyd said 'goodbye' to Dulles on the 20th, they had already agreed in principle to hold a summit conference within the United Nations to enhance the authority of this organization."

Enhancing the "authority" of the United Nations seems to be the focus of the Anglo-American counter-proposal. On the afternoon of the 22nd, when Lloyd spoke in Parliament, in addition to using various technical reasons to prove the benefits of a special meeting of the Security Council, he particularly emphasized that the Lebanese and Jordanian issues must be resolved within the framework of the United Nations. Macmillan's reply further stated that in discussing the Lebanese and Jordanian issues, "the Security Council's procedures should not be exceeded."

Why did the United States and Britain suddenly think of enhancing the "authority" of the United Nations? Why does Macmillan insist that the Lebanese and Jordanian issues should be resolved "without exceeding the procedures of the Security Council"? Just a few days ago, they could kick this organization aside and advance into the Middle East. Now the tune has suddenly changed. It seems that the so-called "special meeting of the Security Council" is just a guise, because holding such a meeting will inevitably touch on the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Iraq in the Security Council. And these issues cannot be resolved in a few days. In addition, another effect of the British proposal is that if the meeting is finally convened, it will obviously be conducive to the United States and Britain realizing a conspiracy: to legitimize their aggression through United Nations activities, such as organizing "police forces," etc.

It is not an exaggeration to compare the British plan to a "delaying tactic." At the same time that Macmillan proposed convening a "special meeting of the Security Council," American and British troops were continuing to head to the Middle East. According to London newspapers, the British aircraft carrier "Hermes" sailed from Portsmouth to the Mediterranean on the 22nd; the US troops in Lebanon have increased to 11,000, and another 17,000 Marines are preparing to be transferred from the US mainland to the Middle East. It seems that the so-called "special meeting of the Security Council" is just a set of diplomatic tricks; and the real goal of the United States and Britain is to gain a foothold in Lebanon and Jordan and prepare to further expand aggression in the Middle East.

### 麦克米伦的缓兵之计

    麦克米伦的缓兵之计
    本报记者　潘非
    苏联关于召开五国首脑会议讨论中东问题的建议，得到了世界舆论的广泛赞同。它获得印度、阿拉伯联合共和国及其他中东国家的积极支持。除此以外，在北大西洋集团内部，有不少国家认为应该立即召开首脑会议，以便采取措施，制止已经开始了的军事干涉。即使法国政府的发言人，也表示原则上接受苏联建议。这种情况，对美英侵略者形成很大的压力。美国和英国要想正面地拒绝苏联建议，是很困难的。就是在这种情况下，英国政府对苏联作了答复。麦克米伦22日给赫鲁晓夫的回信，建议召开安理会的特别会议，由政府首脑参加。
    接着，伦敦的报纸便拚命宣传：到22日中午为止，美国对苏联建议一直是采取死硬的否定态度的。只是由于英国的主动，华盛顿才改变立场，同意召开“安理会特别会议”。这种故意的喧染，显然是企图抬高英国计划的身价，从而使它能在一些北大西洋集团国家和英联邦国家中找到市场。“每日邮报”的报道揭露了事件的真相，它说：“毫无疑问，当劳埃德在20日向杜勒斯说‘再见’的时候，他们已经同意在联合国内举行首脑会议的原则，以提高这个组织的权威。”
    提高联合国的“权威”，这倒似乎是美英反建议的着眼点。22日下午，劳埃德在议会发言时，除了用种种技术性的理由来证明安理会特别会议的好处以外，特别强调黎巴嫩和约旦问题必须在联合国的机构内寻求解决途径。麦克米伦的回信更进一步地表示：在讨论黎巴嫩和约旦问题时，“不应超越安理会的程序”。
    为什么美英忽然想起要提高联合国的“权威”呢？为什么麦克米伦坚持“不应超越安理会的程序”来解决黎巴嫩和约旦问题呢？仅仅在几天以前，它们可以把这个组织一脚踢开，进兵中东。现在忽然腔调一变，武生改唱青衣。看来，所谓“安理会特别会议”云云，只不过是一个幌子，因为要举行这样一个会议，必不可免地会触及到中华人民共和国和伊拉克共和国在安理会的代表权问题。而这样一些问题，是不可能在短短的几天之内得到解决的。另外，英国建议的另一个作用是，假如这个会议终于得以召开，显然有利于美英实现这样一个阴谋：通过联合国活动，如组织“警察部队”等等，使它们的侵略合法化。
    把英国计划比成“缓兵之计”，是并不过分的。就在麦克米伦提出召开“安理会特别会议”的同时，美英军队正继续不断地开往中东。据伦敦报纸报道，英国航空母舰“海神之子”号在22日由朴茨茅斯开往地中海；美国在黎巴嫩的军队已增至一万一千名，另外尚有一万七千名海军陆战队准备由美国本土调往中东。看来，所谓“安理会特别会议”只不过是一套外交把戏；而争取在黎巴嫩和约旦站稳脚跟，准备进一步扩大在中东的侵略，则是美英的真正目的。
