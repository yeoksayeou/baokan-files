    Yankee and British Robbers, Get Out of the Middle East!
    Guo Xiaochuan
    The Faisal dynasty was like a great mountain,
    Pressing the Iraqi people until their sweat became rivers and their tears flowed like springs,
    If people want to overthrow it, then they overthrow it,
    What does it have to do with your American and British governments?
    The Chamoun government held a blood-stained whip,
    Lashing the Lebanese people half to death,
    If people demand an uprising, then there should be an uprising,
    What does it have to do with your American and British governments?
    Eisenhower, you are truly absurd,
    Saying sending troops to another country is to "protect citizens,"
    You, the United States, also have many foreigners living there,
    Can people send troops to invade the United States?
    Eisenhower, you are truly honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted,
    Calling aggression "protecting Lebanese sovereignty,"
    If people also send troops to New York and San Francisco,
    Then what would your American officials have to say?
    British warmongers are so vicious and evil!
    Calling landing in Jordan "protecting Jordan's independence,"
    Then can other countries' armies climb onto the British Isles
    And also protect your shameless selves?
    Yankee and British robbers, get out of the Middle East immediately!
    All your excuses only prove your shamelessness.
    If you stubbornly refuse to stop your acts of aggression,
    The people of the world will tear off your paper tiger skin!
    Yankee and British robbers, get out immediately!
    The Arab people are no longer isolated,
    Your robbery, the whole world does not allow it,
    Six hundred million heroic Chinese people also resolutely disagree!

    美英强盗，从中东滚出去！
    郭小川
    费萨尔王朝好像一座大山，
    压得伊拉克人汗成河、泪如泉，
    人家爱把它推翻，就把它推翻，
    与你美英政府又有何相干？
    夏蒙政府拿着带血的鞭子，
    把黎巴嫩人抽得活过来、死过去，
    人家要求起义，就该起义，
    跟你美英政府有什么关系？
    艾森豪威尔你真是荒谬绝伦，
    说开兵到别国是“保护侨民”，
    你美国也住着很多外国人，
    人家可不可以向你美国进军？
    艾森豪威尔你真是口蜜腹剑，
    把侵略说成“保护黎巴嫩主权”，
    如果人家也进军到纽约、旧金山，
    那么你美国官员们又有何言？
    英国战争贩子多么穷凶恶极！
    把登陆约旦说成“保护约旦的独立”，
    那么别国军队可否爬上英伦三岛去
    也保护保护老不要脸的你？
    美英强盗，立即从中东滚回去！
    一切借口都反证你们无耻。
    如果你们的侵略行为硬不停止，
    全世界人民就要扒掉你们的纸老虎皮！
    美英强盗，立即滚回去！
    阿拉伯人民早已不孤立，
    你们这强盗勾当，全世界都不允许，
    六万万英勇的中国人民也坚决不依！
