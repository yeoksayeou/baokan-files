Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to estimates from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Great Leap Forward Conference on Self-Made Instrument Repair and Manufacturing, the current reliance on foreign imports for certain major scientific research instruments and equipment in China will be transformed into self-sufficiency within three to five years.

    This conference was held in Beijing from June 28th to July 5th. More than 200 technical staff and administrative leaders from 59 research units affiliated with the Academy of Sciences participated in the conference.

    Concurrent with the Great Leap Forward Conference on Instrument Repair and Manufacturing, an exhibition of self-made equipment was also held. The Great Leap Forward Conference and the exhibition reviewed the technical capabilities of the scientific research sector in instrument repair and manufacturing. Over the past few years, various instrument repair and manufacturing departments have supplied a great deal of equipment for scientific research work, playing a significant role in coordinating and promoting scientific research. The exhibition featured 1,679 items of self-made instruments and equipment (1,179 physical objects, the rest being photographs and charts), including a complete set of electronic instruments for electrophysiological experiments, magnetic cores for electronic computers, laboratory liquid-phase thermal diffusion fractionation columns, quartz spring balances, large-scale polarization devices, metal hydrogen and oxygen determination devices, topographic theodolites, and more than one hundred items, such as oxides of rare earth elements, that reached or exceeded advanced world standards.

    During the conference, representatives from the repair and manufacturing departments of 32 research institutes reported on their Great Leap Forward plans and five-year long-term plans. Each institute competed in drive, planning, and creativity, striving to be the best. The Materials Factory of the Shanghai Office of the Academy of Sciences proposed that after the Third Five-Year Plan, the factory would become a world-class comprehensive factory. The Electromechanical Office of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics proposed that within three years, the institute would basically cease ordering professional instruments and equipment from abroad and supply silicate professional instruments and equipment to relevant laboratories nationwide. This institute will change the high-vacuum instruments that were to be ordered from abroad in 1959 to be manufactured by themselves. The Electronics Office of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, while ensuring quality, will produce 100 of the most advanced instruments each year after five years, and will comprehensively catch up with the United Kingdom and the United States in the manufacture of electrophysiological instruments within three years. The Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics wants to complete the TT2/6 type theodolite, originally scheduled for completion in 1967, before "National Day" this year. The self-made electron microscopes, universal tool microscopes, large-scale spectrometers, and other equipment of this institute are to be completed before "National Day". The optical instruments they manufacture are to catch up with the technical level of the German Zeiss factory in 1959.

    The conference also discussed the establishment of a strong and complete technical equipment system for the production and supply of scientific research needs, and carried out cooperation in repair and manufacturing work. More than 300 mutual cooperation projects were proposed between the various research institutes during the conference, of which about two-thirds were resolved on the spot.

    我国科学研究部门某些主要仪器设备
    三、五年内将自给自足
    新华社6日讯  根据中国科学院自制仪器修制工作跃进大会的估计，我国科学研究部门目前某些主要仪器设备依靠国外进口的状况，将在三、五年内改变为自给自足。
    这次大会是6月28日到7月5日在北京举行的。科学院所属五十九个研究单位的技术工作人员和行政负责人二百多人参加了大会。
    和仪器修制工作跃进大会举行同时，还举办了自制器材展览会。跃进大会和展览会检阅了科学研究部门的修制技术工作力量。几年来各仪器修制部门供应了科学研究工作很多的装备，在配合和促进科学研究工作中起了很大的作用。这次展览会展出的自制仪器设备就有一千六百七十九项（实物一千一百七十九项，其他为照片和图表），其中有电生理学实验用的全套电子仪器、电子计算机用磁心，实验室液相热扩散分馏柱、石英弹簧秤、大型偏光装置、金属定氢定氧装置、地形——经纬仪、稀土元素的氧化物等百多项达到或超过世界先进水平。
    大会期间，三十二个研究所的修制部门代表报告了他们的跃进规划和五年远景规划，各研究所比干劲，比规划，比创造，力争上游。科学院上海办事处器材厂提出，在第三个五年计划后，这个厂将成为世界上第一流的综合厂。冶金陶瓷研究所机电室提出，三年内要使所内专业用的仪器设备基本上不向国外订货，并使矽酸盐专业仪器设备供应全国有关的实验室。这个研究所将1959年提向国外订货的高真空仪器改为自己制造。生理生化研究所电子室在保证质量的前提下，五年后每年要制出一百种最先进的仪器，三年内在电生理学仪器的制造上全面赶上英美。光学精密机械仪器研究所要使原定1967年完成的TT2／6型经纬仪，提前于今年“十一”完成。这个研究所自制的电子显微镜、万能工具显微镜、大型光谱仪等要在“十一”完成。他们制造的光学仪器要在1959年内赶上德国蔡司厂的技术水平。
    大会还讨论了关于建立强大的完整的生产和供应科学研究所需要的技术装备体系问题，并在修制工作上展开协作。会议期间各研究所之间提出的相互协作的项目有三百多件，其中有三分之二左右当场获得解决。
