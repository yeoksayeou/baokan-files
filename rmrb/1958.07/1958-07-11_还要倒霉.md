    Still More Bad Luck

    Walter Lippmann, a well-known American commentator on international affairs, recently published an article in the "Washington Post" in which he lamented that America's "strength and prestige" were no longer working. He cited as an example the fact that Cuban people's guerrillas had captured more than forty North Americans, including American soldiers. He believes that in a place like Cuba, "a part of an island completely controlled by the American navy," the local people's guerrillas "dare" to capture American soldiers, and the United States, with its massive "deterrent force" and "the power and prestige of a great power," can do nothing about it. This illustrates the "limitations" of "military power."

    The era when imperialist countries resorted to gunboat diplomacy and did whatever they wanted is over. Even the likes of Lippmann cannot help but admit this. However, the failure of the imperialist gunboat policy is not due to any "limitations" of "military power," but because the people of all countries fighting for independence and freedom are inspired by the strength of the national independence movement, and their awareness has been greatly enhanced, so that they simply do not take any "deterrent force" seriously. If the imperialists cannot see this and still cling to military power, then they are bound to have even more bad luck.

    还要倒霉
    美国颇有名气的国际问题评论家李普曼，最近在“华盛顿邮报”上发表的一篇文章中不胜慨叹地承认，美国的“力量和威信”已经不再行时了。他举了古巴人民游击队俘掳了四十多个北美洲人，其中包括美国士兵一事作为例子。他认为在古巴这样一个“完全由美国海军控制下的海面上的一个岛屿的一部分”的地方，当地的人民游击队“敢于”俘掳美国士兵，而拥有大规模“威慑力量”和具有“大国的力量和威严”的美国竟莫可奈何，这说明了“军事力量”的“局限性”。
    帝国主义国家动辄诉诸炮舰、为所欲为的时代已经过去了。这连李普曼之流也不能不承认了。但是帝国主义炮舰政策的失效，并不是由于什么“军事力量”的“局限性”，而是由于为独立和自由而战的各国人民受到民族独立运动力量的鼓舞，觉悟大大提高了，从而就根本不把什么“威慑力量”放在眼里。帝国主义者看不到这一点，而还要迷信什么军事力量，那么，他们就不免要更加倒霉的。
