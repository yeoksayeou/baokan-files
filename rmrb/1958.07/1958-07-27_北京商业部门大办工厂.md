    Beijing Commercial Departments Vigorously Establish Factories

    (Our Dispatch) Beijing’s commercial departments are establishing several hundred small factories. Some of these factories have already started production, and most of them will be put into operation within July.

    These small factories established by the commercial departments are urgently needed for industrial and agricultural production and for the market. The industrial departments and agricultural cooperatives are unable to set them up in time, but the commercial departments have the conditions to do so. These small factories include factories producing daily necessities, factories processing agricultural and sideline products, and demonstration factories promoting the development of agricultural and sideline production, such as comprehensive experimental factories for chickens, ducks, rabbits, and pigs, and small indigenous sugar factories established with the assistance of various districts.

    Currently, the Ajinomoto factory, a small chemical factory, the Tongzhou rayon factory, a comprehensive substitute liquor factory, the Shunyi waste product processing factory, and an indigenous fertilizer factory have been put into operation. Rayon factories in various districts have also been trial-producing and starting production. According to preliminary estimates, the total output value of various processing factories newly built by the supply and marketing cooperative system alone will be more than 45.5 million yuan in the second half of the year. The output value of small daily necessities factories established by the commercial bureau system will reach 20 million yuan this year. After more than one hundred indigenous sugar factories and comprehensive chicken, duck, pig, and rabbit breeding farms established by the commercial departments in cooperation with districts and townships are all put into production, Beijing's supply of major non-staple foods can achieve self-sufficiency in the short term.

    The Beijing commercial departments have managed to spend little or no money in establishing these small factories. The funds, equipment, and personnel needed to run the factories are all raised by the commercial departments themselves or jointly by the agricultural cooperatives, without asking the state for money.

    北京商业部门大办工厂
    本报讯　北京市商业部门正在兴办几百个小型工厂，现在部分工厂已经开工生产，大部分工厂7月份内可以投入生产。
    商业部门兴办的这些小型工厂，都是工农业生产和市场迫切需要，工业部门、农业社来不及办，而商业部门有条件办的。这些小型工厂中，有生产日常生活用品的工厂，有农副产品加工厂，还有促进农副业生产发展的示范工厂，如协助各区举办的鸡、鸭、兔、猪综合试验厂和小型土糖厂等。
    现在，味之素工厂、小型化工厂、通州人造棉厂、代用品制酒综合工厂、顺义废品加工厂、土制肥料厂等已经投入生产。各区人造棉工厂也已经试制和开始生产。据初步计算，仅供销社系统下半年新建各种加工厂的生产总值就有四千五百多万元。商业局系统兴办的日常生活用品小型工厂，今年的产值达二千万元。商业部门配合区乡兴办的一百多个土糖厂和鸡、鸭、猪、兔综合喂养厂全部投入生产以后，北京市主要副食品供应在短期内可以达到自给自足。
    北京市商业部门举办这些小型工厂，作到了少花钱或不花钱。办工厂需要的资金、设备、人员，都是商业部门自筹或农业社协作筹办，不向国家要钱。
