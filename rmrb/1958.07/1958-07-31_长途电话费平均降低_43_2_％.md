    Xinhua News Agency, July 30th. With the approval of the State Council, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will reduce and adjust domestic long-distance telephone rates starting August 1, 1958. This is an important measure taken by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to better serve the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. The reduction in long-distance telephone rates is based on the principle of "decreasing more for longer distances, and decreasing less for shorter distances," with an average reduction of 43.2%. Specifically, rates for distances within 500 kilometers will generally be reduced by 33.3%, rates for distances between 500 and 1,000 kilometers will be reduced by 40% to 50%, and rates for distances over 1,000 kilometers will be reduced by over 50%. The largest reduction will be for distances over 2,000 kilometers, with a reduction of 57.2%.
    Long-distance telephone calls will also implement a three-tiered pricing system. Calls made between 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM will be charged at the full rate; calls made between 6:00 PM and 12:00 AM will be charged at 70% of the full rate; and calls made between 12:00 AM and 7:00 AM will be charged at half the full rate. Calls made on Sundays and legal holidays will be charged at half the full rate, day and night.
