Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 14th. Amman Radio announced tonight that, due to the "absence" of Iraqi King Faisal, the pro-Western King Hussein of Jordan is taking over the constitutional powers of the Head of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation from the 14th and will correspondingly become the supreme commander of all armed forces of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation.

According to the constitution of this federation, the head of the federation is Iraqi King Faisal. Faisal's whereabouts are unknown after the Iraqi army launched a coup and established a republic.

Amman Radio also broadcast Hussein's order, additionally appointing Habes al-Majali as Chief of Staff of the Army.

The radio said that the Jordanian Royal Palace held a series of meetings on the 14th, presided over by Hussein. Participants included Prime Minister Rifai and his ministers, the Speaker of the Federal Parliament, Army Chief of Staff Majali, and some unidentified heads of diplomatic missions stationed in Amman.

The radio also broadcast a speech by King Hussein on the 14th, in which he called on Jordanians to "remain calm and not believe the news about Iraq" unless it came from what he called "legitimate" authorities.

According to a report in the Damascus newspaper "Al-Alam" on the 13th, reliable sources from Amman said that popular resistance movements against the Hussein regime had also occurred in Jordan. On the 13th, several explosions occurred in the capital, Amman. In Jerusalem, Amman, and Nablus, patriots distributed thousands of leaflets strongly opposing the recent conspiracies of the pro-Western King Hussein. Hussein has already arrested seventy Jordanian officers on charges of "preparing a coup to subvert the dynasty."

    约旦王室也坐在火山口
    侯赛因拚命挣扎声称接管伊约联邦元首权力
    据新华社大马士革14日电　安曼电台今晚宣布，由于伊拉克国王费萨尔“不在”，亲西方的约旦国王侯赛因从14日起接管伊拉克—约旦联邦元首的宪法权力，并且相应地成为伊拉克—约旦联邦全部武装力量的最高统帅。
    根据这个联邦的宪法，联邦的元首是伊拉克国王费萨尔。在伊拉克军队发动政变、成立共和国后，费萨尔下落不明。
    安曼电台还广播了侯赛因的命令，另外任命哈巴斯·马贾利为陆军参谋长。
    电台说，约旦王宫在14日召开了一连串的会议，会议是由侯赛因主持的，参加会议的有首相里法伊和他的大臣们、联邦议会议长、陆军参谋长马贾利以及一些没有透露的驻安曼外交使团的团长。
    电台还广播了侯赛因国王14日发表的演说，他在演说中要求约旦人“保持镇静，并且不要相信关于伊拉克的消息”，除非这种消息是来自他称之为“合法”的当局方面的。
    据大马士革“旗帜报”13日报道，来自安曼的可靠消息说，在约旦也已经发生了反对侯赛因政权的人民抵抗运动，13日，在首都安曼就发生了数起爆炸事件。在耶路撒冷、安曼和纳普鲁斯，爱国者曾经散发了几千张传单，表示强烈反对亲西方的国王侯赛因最近的阴谋活动。侯赛因已经以“准备举行政变来颠覆王朝”的罪名逮捕了七十名约旦军官。
