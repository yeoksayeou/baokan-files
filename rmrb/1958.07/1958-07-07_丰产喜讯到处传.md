Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th: A 1.045 mu plot of barley in the Lianfu Agricultural Cooperative in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, yielded an average of 5702.6 jin per mu, setting a new record for high barley yield.

This miracle was created by a shock team composed of 13 young people, including Communist Party member Song Yongman from the sixth production team of the Lianfu Agricultural Cooperative.

In addition to Chen Dongliang, member of the Jiexiu County Party Committee and First Secretary of the Lianfu Township Party Committee, Huo Chunfu, Deputy Secretary of the Lianfu Township Party Committee, Zhang Zhengxi, technician from the County Agricultural Construction Bureau, and cadres from the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the agricultural cooperative, many farmers also went to watch the threshing and inspection.

According to technician Zhang Zhengxi: This plot of land had an average density of 1,895,000 barley plants per mu, with a sowing width of 8 inches and a row spacing of only 5 inches. The ears of wheat were very long, generally with 60 grains per ear. The grains were larger, longer, and heavier than ordinary wheat grains. The wheat stalks were slightly thinner than a pencil and generally four feet tall.

Early Rice Yields 2682 Jin Per Mu

This 1.5 mu of early rice was an experimental plot planted by cadres from Taian Township and the second production team of the Taian Cooperative. They implemented complete close planting, planting over 32,000 seedlings per mu, with an average of 13 panicles per seedling, most of which were six to seven inches long.

    丰产喜讯到处传
    大麦亩产5702斤
    据新华社太原6日电　山西省介休县联福农业社一亩零四厘五毫大麦，平均亩产五千七百零二斤六两，创造了大麦高产新纪录。
    这个奇迹是联福农业社第六生产队的共产党员宋永满等十三个青年组成的突击组创造出来的。
    到这个队进行监打验收的，除中共介休县委委员兼联福乡党委第一书记陈东亮、联福乡党委副书记霍春富、县农业建设局技术员张正喜，以及共青团、妇联会和农业社干部外，许多农民还自动去观看。
    据技术员张正喜说：这片地平均每亩密植大麦一百八十九万五千株，播幅八寸宽，行距只五寸。麦穗很长，一穗一般六十粒。麦粒比一般麦粒大、长而且重。麦秆比铅笔稍细一点，一般有四尺高。
    早稻亩产2682斤
    据新华社南昌6日电　江西省乐平县太安乡太安农业社早稻产量初露锋芒，6月30日开始收割的一亩五分早稻平均每亩产干谷二千六百八十二斤二两。
    这一亩五分早稻是太安乡干部与太安社第二生产队第二生产组合种的试验田。他们全部实行密植，每亩栽秧达到三万二千多蔸，每蔸平均有十三个谷穗，大多数谷穗长有六、七寸。收割时，乡、社干部和社员成立十一人的验收小组。中共乐平县委会也派人赶来参加验收。
    大豆亩产895斤
    据新华社福州6日电　福建省莆田县响塘乡柳卓农业社创造了亩产八百九十五斤十一两的大豆丰产新纪录。这个产量超过了去年辽宁省辽中县冷子卜乡先锋农业社亩产八百七十七点二斤大豆的全国最高纪录。
    这个优异的收获是农业社党支部书记郑金蕊、社长柳义苍、副社长郭旺等合种的一块一亩一分七的试验田上取得的。
    试验田是7月1日收成，晒了两天在4日过秤。县委委员韩阴恒、乡党委书记陈瑞林等都在场监秤。（附图片）
