Extracting Potassium Chloride from Seawater

This newspaper reports that farmers in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, have successfully extracted potassium chloride fertilizer from seawater.

After being tested in early rice fields, this fertilizer has shown that rice plants grow with larger ears and more grains, resulting in a 20% increase in production compared to using other local miscellaneous fertilizers.

Farmers in twenty-one coastal townships in Jinjiang County have traditionally possessed the technology to extract bittern and use marine soil as fertilizer. This spring, when manufacturing granular fertilizer in Yamenkou Township, work was suspended due to a shortage of chemical fertilizer. Zhuang Jinshu, the township Party secretary, based on the local resource conditions and referencing the method of producing potash fertilizer from bittern described in books, conducted in-depth research and bold experimentation, finally extracting potassium chloride from bittern.

Now, the Jinjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to build 1,500 potassium chloride fertilizer plants within the next ten days, producing 15,000 to 21,000 tons of potassium chloride fertilizer annually, to prepare more fertilizer for autumn crops and next year's major agricultural production.

    用海水提制氯化钾
    本报讯　福建晋江县农民利用海水提炼氯化钾肥料已获得成功。
    这种肥料经过在早稻田中试用，稻子长得穗大粒多，可以比施其他土杂肥料多增产20％。
    晋江县二十一个沿海乡农民历来有提取盐卤的技术和用海土作肥料的习惯。今年春天衙口乡农民在制造颗粒肥料时，因化学肥料缺乏，发生停工待料。乡党委书记庄金树便根据当地资源的条件，又参阅了书上介绍的用盐卤制造钾肥的办法，经过深入钻研和大胆试验，终于从盐卤中提炼出氯化钾。
    现在中共晋江县委决定在最近十天内兴建氯化钾肥料厂一千五百个，年产一万五千吨到二万一千吨氯化钾肥料，为秋季作物和明年农业大生产准备更多肥料。　（孙德籼）
