	Treat Guests Like Brothers, Treat Guests' Affairs Like One's Own
      One evening, Sun Zhaoliang, a traveler staying at the Joint State-Private San Yuan Hotel in Zhao Zhuizi Hutong, Beijing, was scheduled to leave Beijing that night according to his travel plan, taking the 10:35 pm train to Qingdao. Li Hui, a service worker in the hotel, bought the train ticket for the traveler and returned to help him pack his luggage.
      Li Hui is a 57-year-old veteran service worker. In the past few years, he has been praised many times for his attentive service to travelers. During the socialist Great Leap Forward, his service attitude became even more active and enthusiastic. He treated and cared for every traveler as if they were a close brother returning home from afar, and travelers were touched by his enthusiasm. Sun Zhaoliang was no exception. They packed their luggage and said goodbye to each other. At 9:30 pm, Li Hui escorted Sun Zhaoliang out of the hotel gate and shook hands with him in farewell.
    As soon as Sun Zhaoliang left, the hotel received a telegram from his work unit instructing him not to go to Qingdao but to return to Shenyang immediately. It was already 10:00 pm, with only half an hour before the train departed. Li Hui thought to himself that he must go to the train station to find Sun Zhaoliang and bring him back, so as not to make him travel back and forth in vain, wasting travel expenses and delaying his work. So he took the telegram, ran to the street, took a tram to the train station, rushed into the station's broadcasting room, and asked the broadcaster to find Sun Zhaoliang through the loudspeaker and hand him the telegram. At this time, there was still time to refund the ticket. Sun Zhaoliang refunded the ticket and returned to the San Yuan Hotel with Li Hui, and returned to Shenyang on time the next morning.
    Treat guests like brothers, treat guests' affairs like one's own, this is a fitting praise given by the travelers who have stayed at the San Yuan Hotel to Li Hui.　Beijing　Wang Jian (with picture)

### 待客如兄弟，客事如己事

    待客如兄弟，客事如己事
      傍晚，住在北京赵锥子胡同
  公私合营三元客店的旅客孙兆亮，按照他的出差计划要在当夜离开北京，乘十点三十五分钟火车去青岛。客店里的服务员李会替旅客买妥火车票回来后，又来帮助他整理行装。
      李会是一个五十七岁的老服务员同志。几年来，因为他殷勤
  的招待旅客，曾多次受过表扬。在社会主义大跃进中，他的服务态度更加积极热情，对每一个旅客，都如同从远方回到家里来的
  亲兄弟一样的招待和照顾，旅客们都被他的热情所感动。孙兆亮
  当然也不例外。他俩一边整理行装，一边惜别。九点半钟，李会把孙兆亮送出客店的大门，互相握手告别了。
    孙兆亮刚走，客店里就收到他的工作单位给他拍来的电报，叫他不要去青岛，立刻回沈阳。这时，已到十点，离开车还有半点钟。李会心里想，一定要去火车站把孙兆亮找回来，免得他徒劳往返，浪费了旅费又耽误了工作。于是他拿着电报跑到大街上乘上电车赶到火车站，急忙走进车站的广播室，请广播员同志通过扩音器把孙兆亮找到，把电报交给他。这时，退票还来得及，孙兆亮退了票，和李会一同返回三元客店，第二天清早就按时回沈阳去了。
    待客如兄弟，客事如己事，这是住过三元客店的旅客对李会的一句恰如其分的好评。　北京　王坚（附图片）
