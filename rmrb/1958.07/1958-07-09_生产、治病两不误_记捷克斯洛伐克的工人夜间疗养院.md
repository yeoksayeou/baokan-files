    Production and Treatment Without Delay
    —A Record of the Czechoslovakian Workers' Night Sanatorium
    Around two thirty in the afternoon, just as the early shift workers finished their work, a group of people would gather at the gate of the ČKD-Stalingrad factory in Prague 9, waiting for something. After a while, a beautiful limousine would drive up, and the people would file in one after another. The car would leave the noisy city and drive for about fifteen minutes before turning onto a country road, stopping in front of a quiet courtyard. This was the ČKD-Stalingrad factory's night sanatorium.
    This national unique workers' night sanatorium has been around for five years, and it is specifically for the workers of this famous large machine manufacturing plant. Workers suffering from minor chronic illnesses can enjoy four weeks of treatment, five days a week, with the recommendation of the factory doctor and the approval of the trade union. From Monday to Friday, after work, they take a special car provided by the factory to the sanatorium. After lunch here, they rest for a while, then begin physical examinations and special treatments, followed by various recreational activities. They go to bed at nine o'clock in the evening, and the next morning the workers still take the factory car to work.
    The environment of the sanatorium is beautiful, with hot springs nearby. The facilities inside the sanatorium are very good, with full-time doctors and nurses, various electrotherapy, physiotherapy, and hydrotherapy equipment, as well as massage rooms and sun treatment rooms. The meals for the patients are checked by doctors, and 30% of the people receive special food according to their condition. During recreational activity time, the patients can go to the sanatorium's library to read books, play chess in the chess room, or watch TV and movies.
    In the sanatorium, the average daily cost for each patient is about sixty crowns, but the patient only pays ten crowns (equivalent to 7/1000 of the average monthly salary of a Czech worker), and the rest is borne by the public. Seventy percent of the workers treated here are older workers over the age of forty. Since 1953, three thousand five hundred people have been treated here. Those patients who require longer treatment can come here for treatment twice, three times, or even four times a year.
    Currently, this workers' night sanatorium can treat sixty people per month. After the reorganization of the management system in the Czech industry and construction industry, the ČKD-Stalingrad factory has formed a joint enterprise with five other sister factories. Therefore, the night sanatorium is also actively preparing to expand to serve more workers.

    生产、治病两不误
    ——记捷克斯洛伐克的工人夜间疗养院
    每当下午两点半钟光景，早班工人刚下班，在布拉格九区捷卡德—斯大林格勒工厂门口，就有一群人聚集在那里，在等待什么。不一会，一辆漂亮的大轿车开了过来，人们鱼贯而上。汽车离开喧哗的市区，驶行约一刻钟，就转入乡村公路，在一所幽静的大院落前停下来。这里就是捷卡德—斯大林格勒工厂夜间疗养院。
    这所全国唯一的工人夜间疗养院已有五年历史，它是专为这个著名的大型机器制造厂的工人服务的。患有不严重的慢性病的工人，经工厂医生建议、工会批准，就可享受每周五天、为期四周的治疗。从星期一到星期五，他们下班后，便乘坐厂方特备的汽车来到疗养院。他们在这里进午餐后，略事休息，即开始检查体格和特殊治疗，接着进行各项文娱活动，晚上九时一定上床，第二天清晨工人们仍乘厂方汽车去上班。
    疗养院的环境幽美，附近有温泉，院内设备很好，有专任的医生和护士，有各种电疗、理疗和水疗设备，还有按摩疗室和日光医疗室。疗养者的伙食每顿都经医生检查，有30％的人根据病情得到特殊食物。疗养者在文娱活动时间内，可以到疗养院内的图书馆去看书，到棋室下棋，或去看电视和电影。
    在疗养院里，每个病人一天的用费平均约为六十克朗，但病人自己只付十个克朗（相当于捷工人每个月平均工资的千分之七），其他部分都由公家担负。在这里疗养的工人，70％是四十岁以上的老工人。从1953年以来，已有三千五百人在这里得到治疗。那些需经较长时间治疗的病人可以一年来这里疗养两次、三次甚至四次。
    现在，这一工人夜间疗养院每月可治疗六十人。捷工业和建筑业管理制度实行改组后，捷卡德—斯大林格勒工厂已同其他五个姊妹工厂组成联合企业，因此，夜间疗养院也正积极准备扩大，为更多的工人服务。
