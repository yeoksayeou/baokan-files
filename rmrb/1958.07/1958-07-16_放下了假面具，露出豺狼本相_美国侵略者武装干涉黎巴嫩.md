Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 15th: Despite the opposition of the people of the Middle East and the world, the United States brazenly took direct armed intervention in Lebanon on the 15th.

At 3:00 PM Beirut time today, five thousand U.S. Marines landed at Khaldé bay near the international airport, five miles south of Beirut, under the orders of U.S. President Eisenhower.

Eisenhower, in a formal statement issued at the White House today on the matter, concocted various pretexts for this act of American aggression, saying that the United States sent troops to Lebanon at the so-called "urgent request" of Lebanese President Chamoun, and is currently acting to so-called "protect American nationals" and "encourage the Lebanese government to defend Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Eisenhower also mentioned in this statement that the "serious developments in Baghdad yesterday" were the reason for Chamoun's "urgent request."

Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th: According to well-informed sources, Lebanese President Chamoun had already requested the United States, Britain, and France to immediately send troops to Lebanon on the 14th, on the grounds of "sealing off" the Lebanese-Syrian border.

The report said that the three governments will hold an emergency meeting to discuss Chamoun's request.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th: French Prime Minister de Gaulle convened a cabinet meeting this morning to study the situation in the Middle East caused by the coup in Iraq.

The meeting also studied the "request" made by Lebanese President Chamoun for the United States, Britain, and France to send troops to "protect" the Lebanese-Syrian border.

Prior to this, de Gaulle had also convened a meeting with a group of senior advisors, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Minister of Defense, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, to discuss the situation in Iraq.

De Gaulle hurriedly returned to Paris from Toulon on the evening of the 14th after hearing the news of the coup in Iraq. He was in Toulon that day to attend the French Mediterranean Fleet's National Day parade.

The report said that the events in Iraq have caused great unease among Parisian officials. The French Foreign Ministry has been in contact with London and Washington regarding the situation in the Middle East.

    放下了假面具，露出豺狼本相
    美国侵略者武装干涉黎巴嫩
    据新华社15日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国不顾中东和全世界人民的反对，15日悍然采取了直接武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动。
    今天下午贝鲁特时间三时，五千名美国海军陆战队士兵根据美国总统艾森豪威尔的命令，在贝鲁特以南五英里的国际机场附近的哈尔迪湾登陆。
    艾森豪威尔今天就此事在白宫发表的正式声明中为美国这一侵略行为制造种种借口，他说，美国是根据黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的所谓“紧急请求”派出军队到黎巴嫩去的。目前是所谓“保护美国侨民”和“鼓励黎巴嫩政府保卫黎巴嫩的主权和领土完整”。
    艾森豪威尔在这个声明中还提到“昨天在巴格达发生的事态的严重发展”是促使夏蒙提出“紧急请求”的原因。
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：据消息灵通人士透露：黎巴嫩总统夏蒙已经在14日要求美、英、法三国立即派兵去黎巴嫩，他的理由是为了“封锁”黎巴嫩—叙利亚边境。
    消息说，三国政府将举行紧急会议，就夏蒙的要求进行商讨。
    新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐今天上午召集内阁会议，研究由伊拉克政变引起的中东局势问题。
    这次会议也研究了黎巴嫩总统夏蒙所提出的关于要美、英、法三国派兵“保护”黎巴嫩—叙利亚边境的“请求”。
    在这以前，戴高乐还召集外交部长、国防部副部长和海陆军参谋总长等一批高级顾问人员开会，商讨伊拉克局势问题。
    戴高乐是14日晚上在听到伊拉克政变的消息后匆忙由土伦赶回巴黎的。当天他在土伦参加法国地中海舰队的国庆日检阅式。
    消息说，伊拉克事件在巴黎官方人士中引起很大的不安。法国外交部已经就中东局势问题同伦敦和华盛顿方面进行接触。
