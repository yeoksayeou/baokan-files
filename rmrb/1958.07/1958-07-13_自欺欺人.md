    Self-Deception
    Japanese Ambassador to the United States Koichiro Asakai said: Japanese-American relations are basically "good." But when it comes to trade relations, he couldn't help but reveal a hint of resentment: Japan buys about $1.2 billion worth of goods from the United States every year, making it the second-largest customer of the United States, but "almost no Americans recognize this fact"; as for exports to the United States, breaking through American restrictions is "an arduous task." It seems that the "good" relationship is just a matter of "burning incense at only one end."
    Japan's import of raw materials largely depends on the United States, and most of Japan's exports of groceries contradict the profits of American manufacturers. As a customer, it is necessary to seek help from others and buy necessarily; as a seller, it is unwelcome and rejected. As for switching markets, the pro-American policy implemented by Nobusuke Kishi makes this hope difficult to realize. Being in this awkward position of a minion, while singing hymns about the "good" relationship between Japan and the United States, is nothing more than self-deception and self-consolation.

    自欺欺人
    日本驻美大使朝海浩一郎说：日美关系基本上是“良好”的。但说到贸易关系，言下却不免流露了一股怨气：日本每年从美国买大约十二亿美元的货物，是美国的第二大主顾，可是“几乎没有美国人认识到这个事实”；至于对美出口，要想打破美国的限制，又是“一项艰苦的工作”。看来，关系“良好”云云，不过是“香火头，一头热”而已。
    日本的原材料进口，很大程度上依赖于美国，日本对美出口的杂货，大部分又跟美国制造商的利润发生矛盾。作为顾客，是有求于人，非买不可的；作为卖主，又是不受欢迎、遭受排斥的。至于转换市场呢？岸信介执行的投靠美国的政策，又使这种希望不易实现。处在这种窝窝囊囊的小伙计的地位，而又大唱什么日美关系“良好”之类的喜歌，不过是自欺欺人、聊以自慰罢了。
