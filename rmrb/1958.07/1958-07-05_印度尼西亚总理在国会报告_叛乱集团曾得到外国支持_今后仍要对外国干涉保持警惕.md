Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 4th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda today reported to the Parliament on the government's suppression of the rebellion, foreign interference, and cabinet reshuffle.

	Djuanda said that the rebellion had brought great danger of foreign interference and aggression to Indonesia. He pointed out that the rebel groups had blatantly requested assistance from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, used foreign officers and pilots, and obtained new weapons airdropped from abroad. Djuanda specifically mentioned the American pilot Pope's participation in the air raids on East Indonesia. Djuanda said that the government has the absolute responsibility to suppress the rebellion by force.

	When discussing foreign interference in his report, Djuanda said that the issue of foreign interference cannot be avoided when talking about the rebellion. Since Indonesia accepted the transfer of power from the Netherlands in 1949, all local rebellions and armed bandit activities have been somewhat related to foreign arms dealers and adventurers. Djuanda said that Indonesia's independent and active foreign policy has also been subjected to pressure from various parties, therefore, it is not surprising that foreign countries are very interested in Indonesia's unrest. They are conspiring to make the outcome of the unrest conform to their wishes.

	The Prime Minister emphasized that the Hussein rebellion group had been clamoring for "anti-communism," disguising their rebellion as being based on "anti-communism," and even attracting foreign intervention by promising to join military alliances, thus arousing greater interest from foreigners.

	Djuanda said that the interference carried out by foreign elements in the East Indonesian region is of a more serious nature. Planes piloted by foreigners bombed some areas of East Indonesia, attempting to obstruct the government army's actions. He said that the Indonesian government has obtained conclusive evidence of the use of foreign airfields to attack Indonesia. Djuanda also pointed out that thousands of light and heavy foreign weapons had been transported to Central Sumatra.

	Prime Minister Djuanda specifically talked about the United States' attitude towards the Indonesian rebellion and the Indonesian government's contact with the US government, saying that at the beginning of the rebellion, some senior US military and political officials made statements that supported the activities of the rebel groups. Therefore, the Indonesian government made its best efforts to ask the US government to express its attitude of non-interference in Indonesia.

	Djuanda said that at the same time, Indonesia also sought the sympathy of friendly countries, especially Asian and African countries, diplomatically. He expressed satisfaction with the replies he received from the President of the United Arab Republic and the Prime Ministers of countries such as India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Burma. Djuanda said that his statement on April 30th also received a good response from countries such as the Soviet Union and China.

	Djuanda expressed that vigilance against foreign interference must be maintained in the future.

    印度尼西亚总理在国会报告
    叛乱集团曾得到外国支持
    今后仍要对外国干涉保持警惕
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天在国会代表政府作了关于镇压叛乱、外国干涉和内阁改组等问题的报告。
    朱安达说，叛乱活动曾经给印度尼西亚带来了外国干涉和侵略的极大危险。他指出，叛乱集团曾经明目张胆地要求东南亚条约组织给予帮助，使用了外国的军官和飞行员，并且取得了外国空投的新武器。朱安达特别提到了美国飞行员波普参加了对东印度尼西亚的空袭。朱安达说，政府有用武力镇压叛乱的绝对责任。
    朱安达在报告中谈到外国干涉问题时说，谈到叛乱的问题就不能不提到外国的干涉。印度尼西亚自从1949年接受荷兰移交政权以来，所有局部叛乱和武装匪帮的活动都是多少同外国军火商冒险家有关系。朱安达说，印度尼西亚所奉行的积极的独立政策也遭受各方面的压力，因此，外国对于印度尼西亚的骚乱很感兴趣是不足为奇的。他们阴谋使骚乱的结果符合他们的愿望。
    这位总理着重指出，侯赛尼叛乱集团曾经作“反共”叫嚣，把他们的叛乱装成以“反共”为基础的模样，甚至以许下加入军事联盟的诺言来招引外国的干涉，这样，他们引起了外国人的更大兴趣。
    朱安达说，外国分子在东印度尼西亚地区所进行的干涉，性质更加严重。由外国人驾驶的飞机轰炸了东印度尼西亚的一些地方，企图以此来阻挠政府军的行动。他说，印度尼西亚政府已经得到关于使用外国机场进攻印度尼西亚的确凿证据。朱安达还指出，曾经有数以千计的轻型和重型的外国武器运到中苏门答腊去。
    朱安达总理特别谈到了美国对印度尼西亚叛乱的态度和印度尼西亚政府同美国政府的接触的情况，他说，在叛乱开始发生时，美国的一些高级军政官员的谈话是支持叛乱集团的活动的。因此，印度尼西亚政府尽了最大努力去要求美国政府表示不干涉印度尼西亚的态度。
    朱安达说，同时，印度尼西亚还在外交上争取友好国家特别是亚非国家的同情。他对于阿拉伯联合共和国总统以及印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和缅甸等国家的总理给他的复信表示满意。朱安达说，他在4月30日发表的声明也得到苏联和中国等国家的良好反应。
    朱安达表示今后要对外国干涉保持警惕。
