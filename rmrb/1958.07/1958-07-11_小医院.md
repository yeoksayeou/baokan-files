Down-delegated Cadres Dedicate Technology and Culture to the Countryside!

    Small Hospital

    Down-delegated cadres go to the countryside,
    Agricultural cooperatives welcome them;
    During the day, they read newspapers in their spare time,
    In the evening, they teach literacy at school.
    Newly added members are truly capable,
    Bringing culture and medicine to the villages;
    In the morning, they labor on the land,
    In the afternoon, they provide medical care at the hospital.

    This is a jingle from the members of the Yangjiayu, Songzhuang, and Haozhuang agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, praising the cadres who have been down-delegated there to participate in labor and training. Although this place is close to the city, it is remote, and few doctors come here to practice medicine, so it is very difficult for the masses to see a doctor. It costs several yuan to invite a doctor once, not counting the lost work time. Six teachers from the Taiyuan First Health School who were down-delegated to Songzhuang Township for labor training, learned about the difficulty of local farmers in seeing a doctor, so they first set up a health station in Songzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, stipulating that they would see patients for the villagers every afternoon and work in the fields in the morning. In the past month, they have treated more than 200 people. Then, they established a second health station in Haozhuang Agricultural Cooperative and officially started treating members on May 7. In order to facilitate the masses and achieve "early prevention of disease and early treatment of illness," they also held health exhibitions and mobile medical teams, providing door-to-door diagnosis and treatment. If they cannot treat some major diseases, they sign contracts with the school for diagnosis at any time. Therefore, no member does not praise them. Now they have composed a new jingle: Down-delegated cadres come to train, a small hospital is set up in the village; it saves money and saves work, supporting the great leap forward in agriculture.

专栏：下放干部们把技术和文化献给农村！

    小医院
    下放干部到农村，
    农业社里受欢迎；
    白天空闲把报念，
    晚间扫盲在学堂。
    新添社员真能干，
    文化医药带乡间；
    上午劳动把地上，
    下午诊病在医院。
    这是山西省太原市郊区杨家峪、松庄、郝庄农业社社员，称赞下放到那里参加劳动锻炼的干部的顺口溜。这里虽然离城市较近，可是地方偏僻，医生很少到这里来行医，所以群众看病很困难，请一次医生要花好几元钱，误工还不算。太原第一卫生学校下放到松庄乡劳动锻炼的六位教师，了解到当地农民看病的困难，就先在松庄农业社办起一个保健站，规定每天下午给老乡们看病，上午下地劳动。近一个月来，他们已诊病二百余人次。接着，他们又在郝庄农业社建立起第二个保健站，并于5月7日正式给社员看病。为了便利群众，做到“无病早防，有病早治”，他们还举办了卫生展览和巡回医疗队，上门诊病。有些大病他们看不了，就和学校订立合同，随时诊断。因此，社员没有不称赞他们的。现在他们又编了新的顺口溜：下放干部来锻炼，村里办起了小医院；既省钱来又省工，支援农业大跃进。
