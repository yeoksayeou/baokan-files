    Educating the Masses on the Correct Understanding of the Relationship Between Consumption and Accumulation
    Xixian County Launches Five Investigations, Five Calculations, and Five Debates

    According to the Henan Daily, Xixian County has adopted methods such as five investigations, five calculations, five debates, and holding exhibitions to enable the vast number of cadres and the masses to correctly understand the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and universally demand the expansion of public accumulation. According to statistics from forty-seven agricultural cooperatives, more than 17,000 of the original 18,000 people who advocated more distribution and less accumulation now agree to expand public accumulation. Of the county's 295 cooperatives, 182 cooperatives have public accumulation accounting for 90% of increased production, 101 cooperatives account for 80%, and 12 cooperatives account for 70%.

    Xixian County had an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops. The county's 1,065,000 mu of wheat has an average yield of 200 jin per mu, nearly double the 108 jin of last year. Faced with the bumper harvest, the vast number of cadres and the masses were excited and encouraged. However, many people lacked a correct understanding of the relationship between accumulation and consumption. Some cadres had right-leaning conservative ideas, and even resistance. Some cadres had blindly optimistic and complacent paralyzing thoughts, believing that after socialist education and the Party rectification and commune movement, the masses' awareness had improved, and it would be easy to convince them to expand accumulation and purchase machines, without much effort. Agricultural cooperative cadres, having experienced the difficulty of insufficient production funds in leading production, mostly advocated expanding accumulation, but feared that excessive deductions would affect living standards. Some used the excuse that it was difficult to get through to the commune members' thinking and feared affecting their production enthusiasm to resist expanding public accumulation.

    Through a review of the cadres' ideological situation, the county Party committee believed that conscientiously implementing policies and criticizing right-leaning ideology among cadres was a crucial key to doing a good job in distribution and ensuring the expansion of public accumulation. Therefore, in mid-May, it convened an enlarged conference of county, township, and cooperative cadres with more than 560 participants, conscientiously conveyed and studied the spirit of the provincial and district Party committee instructions and the county Party committee's pre-distribution plan, and launched a great airing of views, a great blooming of ideas, and a great debate. Through airing views, debates, and on-the-spot visits, they corrected their thinking and improved their understanding. After the meeting, each township convened a meeting of cadres above the level of team leader to convey and implement the spirit. The county Party committee also organized various government departments and schools to visit the agricultural cooperative's pre-distribution exhibition hall and carry out a great debate on "whether or not to expand public accumulation" in the agricultural cooperatives, unifying ideological understanding.

    On the basis of thoroughly airing and fully expressing views, each township and cooperative also relied on poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out five investigations, five calculations, and five debates.

    1.  Investigate last year's deductions, calculate the harm of less accumulation, and debate whether or not to expand accumulation this year.

    Last year, some cooperatives, due to one-sidedly taking care of the masses' immediate interests, deducted less funds than they should have, which affected the development of production. When the Zhengzhai cooperative carried out distribution last year, not only did it not retain enough seeds, but it also distributed the 12,000 yuan of advance payment due to the state to the commune members. As a result, it planted 275 mu less wheat last year, reducing income by 53,000 jin. Therefore, in airing views and debates, commune members proposed expanding public accumulation one after another. Commune member Chen Xiangwei said in the debate: "If this year's deductions are the same as last year, not to mention achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, even 100 jin cannot be guaranteed."

    2.  Investigate the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock, calculate the effectiveness of mechanization, and debate whether or not to achieve mechanization.

    With the great leap forward in production, the phenomenon of insufficient labor and livestock is widespread. For example, the Xiangdian cooperative investigated and calculated that the whole cooperative lacked 346 laborers and 214 head of livestock for the summer harvest and summer planting this year. Therefore, the vast number of commune members have an extremely urgent demand for the realization of mechanization. After debate, the commune members said: This year, they would rather not make fancy clothes, but also keep the money in the cooperative to buy machines.

    3.  Investigate production planning projects, calculate the funds needed, and debate whether it is possible not to expand public accumulation.

    The Luhe cooperative plans to use 13,440 yuan for production investment before autumn, 71,000 yuan for purchasing various machines and farm tools, and 12,000 yuan for repaying loans, totaling 96,440 yuan. At present, the cooperative only has 5,000 yuan, with a shortage of 91,440 yuan. After the plan was announced to the masses, most people proposed to greatly expand public accumulation to ensure the realization of the plan. However, well-to-do middle peasant Ma Rongfu said: "If we deduct too much, the commune members will not eat well and cannot produce. Tractors cannot be eaten." Poor peasant commune member Chen Zhuli used facts to debate with him, saying: "In the past, without machines, you shouted that your legs and arms were sore from hauling water to fight drought. Last year, our cooperative bought a boiler engine, which can irrigate dozens of mu a day, and everyone didn't suffer, and grain production could also increase. You say how great the benefits of machines are." As a result, Ma Rongfu nodded and admitted his mistake, and said that he would save money and support the cooperative in doing a good job in production in the future. All commune members unanimously proposed to use 93% of the increased production as public accumulation for expanding production.

    4.  Investigate increased production, calculate accumulation, and debate how to use funds.

    There was more controversy among commune members on this issue. Some proposed to buy more chemical fertilizers, some proposed to buy machines, women proposed to buy sewing machines and small steel mills, young people proposed to buy transportation tools and increase cultural and recreational equipment, and accountants proposed to build offices... When debating this issue, each cooperative generally grasped the further implementation of the education of running cooperatives and managing households diligently and thriftily, and proposed that the accumulated funds should first meet the needs of a great harvest throughout the year and the needs of tool reform; then, according to the possibility of mechanization, appropriately plan the funds required; and the funds needed for cultural and recreational aspects must be planned and used according to the possibility of public welfare funds, based on the principle of thrift. After the Wenglou cooperative debated according to the above spirit, many commune members examined their extravagant and wasteful thoughts. Weng Tingan, who originally proposed to buy a bicycle, said: "If production is not done well, you can't ride a bicycle. Only by doing a good job in production first can you buy a car in the future."

    5.  Investigate the living standards of commune members, calculate this year's income, and debate whether or not life has improved.

    A small number of upper-middle peasants put forward the erroneous argument that expanding public accumulation would lead to a decline in the living standards of commune members. Many poor and lower-middle peasants used their personal experiences and the great improvement in their lives to refute them powerfully. Liu Wenguo, a new upper-middle peasant in the Luhe cooperative, said: "Last year, we kept more during the distribution, and the commune members distributed less, so the commune members' lives were not good, and the commune members suffered. This year, we must distribute more and improve our lives." Poor peasant Ma Zhengyu said: "Our cooperative uses 93% of the increased production for public accumulation. Except for 23 commune member households whose income is the same as last year, the income of 420 households has increased. My family distributed 80 yuan last year and only raised one pig. This year, we can distribute 91 yuan and raise two more pigs and two sheep, and the income has increased by dozens of yuan compared to last year. Whoever says that expanding accumulation cannot improve the lives of commune members, and that every year is worse than the last, I resolutely want to debate with him to the end!" After the debate, Liu Wenguo said: "My capitalist thinking is serious, and I need everyone to criticize me well."

    In order to widely and deeply implement various distribution policies, and better improve the patriotism and cooperative love awareness of cadres and the masses, many agricultural cooperatives have held summer pre-distribution exhibition halls. At present, 295 exhibition halls have been held throughout the county.

    教育群众正确认识消费和积累的关系
    息县开展五查五算五辩论
    据河南日报讯　息县采取五查五算五辩论、举办展览会的办法，使广大干部和群众正确认识积累和消费的关系，普遍要求扩大公共积累。据四十七个农业社统计，原来主张多分少积累的一万八千多人，现在有一万七千多人同意扩大公共积累。全县二百九十五个社，公共积累占增产部分90％的有一百八十二个社，占80％的有一百零一个社，占70％的有十二个社。
    息县夏季作物空前丰收，全县一百零六万五千多亩小麦，平均亩产可达二百斤，比去年一百零八斤增产近一倍。面对着丰收，广大干部和群众兴奋鼓舞，但是，有不少人对于积累和消费的关系缺乏正确的认识，部分干部存在着右倾保守思想，甚至有抵触情绪。部分干部存在盲目乐观和自满麻痹思想，认为经过社会主义教育和整党整社运动，群众觉悟提高了，扩大积累购买机器，一说群众就通，不用费啥劲。农业社的干部在领导生产上已体会到生产资金不足的困难，大部分主张扩大积累，但又怕扣除过多影响生活。有的以社员思想不好打通，怕影响社员生产情绪为借口，抵制扩大公共积累。
    通过对干部思想情况的排队，县委认为在干部中认真贯彻政策，批判右倾思想，是搞好分配工作，保证扩大公共积累的重要关键。因此，于5月中旬召开了五百六十余人参加的县、乡、社三级扩大干部会议，认真传达学习了省委、地委指示精神和县委预分方案，开展了大鸣大放大辩论，通过鸣放辩论，实地参观，端正了思想，提高了认识。会后各乡分别召开了队长以上干部会议，进行传达贯彻。县委还组织了各机关、学校到农业社参观预分展览馆和开展农业社“要不要扩大公共积累”的大辩论，统一了思想认识。
    在鸣深放透的基础上，各乡、社还依靠贫农和下中农，开展了五查五算五辩论。
    一、查去年扣除，算积累少的危害，辩论今年应不应扩大积累。
    去年部分社由于片面地照顾了群众眼前利益，应多扣的资金而少扣了，影响了生产的发展。郑寨社去年进行分配时，不但应留的种子没有留够，还把应归还国家一万二千元的预付定金也分给了社员，结果去年少种小麦二百七十五亩，减少收入五万三千斤。因此，社员在鸣放、辩论中，纷纷提出扩大公共积累。社员陈祥维在辩论中说：“今年扣除要和去年一样，甭说实现亩产千斤，连一百斤也保不住。”
    二、查劳畜力不足的困难，算机械化的效能，辩论要不要实现机械化。
    随着生产大跃进，劳畜力不足的现象普遍存在，如项店社查算，全社今年夏收夏种缺少劳力三百四十六人，牲口二百一十四头，因而广大社员对实现机械化的要求极为迫切。经过辩论，社员们说：今年宁愿不做花衣服，也要把款留在社里买机器。
    三、查生产规划项目，算需要资金，辩论不扩大公共积累行不行。
    闾河社秋前规划需用生产投资一万三千四百四十元，购置各种机器和农具需款七万一千元，归还贷款一万二千元，合计需款九万六千四百四十元。目前社内仅有款五千元，尚缺九万一千四百四十元。把规划向群众公布后，多数人提出要大量扩大公共积累，保证实现规划。但是富裕中农马荣富说：“多扣除，社员吃不好不能生产。拖拉机也不能当饭吃。”贫农社员陈主立用事实和他辩论说：“过去没机器，抗旱戽水，你叫喊着累的腿痛胳膊酸。去年咱社买部锅驼机，一天能浇几十亩，大家没受累，粮食还能多增产。你说机器的好处有多大。”结果马荣富点头认错，并表示今后要省吃俭用，支援社里搞好生产。全体社员一致提出将增产的93％作为公共积累，用于扩大生产。
    四、查增产，算积累，辩论资金怎样使用。
    在这一问题上，社员的争论较大。有的提出多买化肥，有的提出购买机器，妇女提出买缝纫机、小钢磨，青年人提出买交通工具和增加文娱设备，会计提出盖办公室……。各社在辩论这一问题时，一般都抓住了进一步贯彻勤俭办社勤俭持家的教育，并提出积累的资金应首先满足全年大丰收的需要和工具改革的需要；然后根据机械化的可能，适当规划所需用的资金；对文化娱乐方面所需要的资金，必须根据公益金的可能，本着节约的原则规划使用。翁楼社根据以上精神辩论之后，不少社员都检查了铺张浪费的思想，原提出要买自行车的翁廷安说：“生产搞不好，自行车也骑不着，只有先搞好生产，今后还可买小汽车。”
    五、查社员生活水平，算今年收入，辩论生活有没有改善。
    小部分上中农提出，扩大公共积累会使社员生活下降的错误论调，不少贫农和下中农都以亲身经历和他们生活的大大改善，有力地进行了驳斥。闾河社新上中农刘文国说：“去年分配留的多，社员分的少，社员生活不好，社员受罪。今年咋着也得多分，改善改善生活。”贫农马正玉说：“咱社今年增产的93％扩大公共积累，除二十三户社员收入和去年相同外，四百二十户都增加收入了。俺家去年分八十元，只喂一头猪，今年能分九十一元，又多喂了两头猪、两只羊，收入比去年增加几十元，谁说扩大积累不能改善社员生活、一年不如一年，我坚决要和他辩论到底！”经过辩论，刘文国说：“我的资本主义思想严重，需要大家好好批评批评。”
    为了广泛深入地贯彻各项分配政策，更好地提高干部和群众爱国爱社觉悟，许多农业社分别举办了夏季预分展览馆。目前全县已经举办了二百九十五处展览馆。
