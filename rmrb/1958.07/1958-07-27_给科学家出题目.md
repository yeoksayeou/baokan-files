The comrades of the Tillage Teaching and Research Group and the Soil Teaching and Research Group of the Northwest Agricultural College conducted a detailed investigation of the various methods of deep plowing used by the masses in Changge County, Henan, and wrote an article based on scientific principles and analysis. We believe that this article will greatly help various places to learn from Changge County's experience in deep plowing; at the same time, this is a concrete manifestation of scientific research serving production, and it is worthy of promotion.

In order to better integrate scientific research with production, we suggest that, in addition to scientists formulating relevant research topics according to plan, it is best to let the masses make requests and propose topics to scientists. We believe that scientists will welcome this approach.

Here, we would like to raise a question that we encountered during the editing process: At present, the specifications for close planting vary from place to place. Some places advocate changing small-plant close planting to large-plant close planting, while others advocate changing large-plant close planting to small-plant close planting. Still others believe that medium-plant close planting is the most productive. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these three specifications? Under what conditions should each specification be used? What issues should be paid attention to in cultivation techniques when using different close planting specifications? We hope that scientists in various places will conduct scientific research based on local practices and conditions.

### 给科学家出题目

    给科学家出题目
    西北农学院耕作教研组和土壤教研组的同志们到河南长葛县对群众深翻地的各种方法进行了详细的调查，并且根据科学道理作了分析研究，写成文章，在报纸上发表。我们相信，这篇文章对各地学习长葛县深翻地的经验有很大帮助；同时这也是科学研究工作为生产服务的具体表现，值得提倡。
    为了更好地把科学研究工作和生产结合起来，我们建议，除了科学家有计划地制定有关的研究题目之外，最好也让群众向科学家提一些要求，出一些题目。我们相信，科学家对这个做法一定会表示欢迎。
    这里，先把我们在编辑工作中遇到的一个问题提出来：现在各地对密植规格各有不同，有的地方提倡改小株密植为大株密植，有的地方又主张变大株密植为小株密植，还有的地方认为中株密植最能增产。究竟这三种规格各有那些利弊？在什么条件下应该使用那种规格？使用不同的密植规格时，在栽培技术上需要注意那些问题？希望各地科学家根据当地的做法和条件进行科学研究。
