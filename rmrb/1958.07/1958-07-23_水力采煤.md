Hydraulic Mining

"Water can mine coal?" This is a very novel idea for people. Because water has always been the enemy of miners. From the first day of opening a mine, miners encounter water, which constantly flows out of the cracks in the rocks or coal seams. If it is not drained in time, it will flood the mine and bring the entire mine's production to a standstill. In order not to hinder the work, we must constantly fight against the enemy – water. Powerful water pumps work day and night in the mine, draining hundreds or even thousands of tons of water every day. Who would have thought that this fierce enemy would become the miners' friend, and that people would use it to mine coal.

Water, it looks so calm and weak. However, after passing through a water jetting tool – a hydraulic monitor (also called a water cannon, this water cannon is made of several different steel pipes that can withstand high pressure), when it is subjected to a high pressure of 30 to 60 atmospheres or more under the action of a high-pressure water pump, the water will rush out at a speed of 70 to 80 meters per second or even more than 100 meters per second. At this time, this water flow shows extraordinary power. When it rushes towards the coal seam, the coal seam will be washed into small pieces by it. After the broken coal falls, it mixes with water and flows along the chute laid in the roadway. This coal slurry flows to a huge iron sieve. At this time, water and coal pieces smaller than 50 mm fall into the trough under the sieve and continue to flow forward; the coal pieces remaining on the sieve flow into a crusher through the sieve surface. The crusher crushes the large pieces of coal to less than 50 mm, and then mixes it with the original coal slurry and flows together into a rectangular coal-water pool. Finally, the coal slurry is pumped to the ground with a coal-water pump. After sedimentation, the coal slurry is sent to the coal preparation plant. After coal preparation and drying, it can be loaded and transported. This water returns to the clean water pool on the ground, and under the action of a high-pressure water pump, it is sent to the underground again for the water cannon to use.

In this way, water has almost become the only working substance in the coal mine. It works tirelessly for people, sometimes underground, sometimes above ground; sometimes it sprays out of the water cannon to impact the coal seam, and sometimes it carries coal pieces flowing in the pipes. Here, water has become the most loyal and obedient servant and assistant of the miners.

Hydraulic mining has many advantages. It can comprehensively reform the entire mine's production process and change many complex production processes. In the past, a coal mining face required dozens of processes from the beginning of work to the removal of coal. If hydraulic mining can be used, those complex coal mining processes can be turned into a single assembly line operation. In hydraulic mining mines, you cannot see large and small machines, you can only see water cannons fighting. Beside the water cannons, you can hardly see any workers except for two water cannon operators. The labor productivity of hydraulic coal production can be increased by at least four or five times, and the cost is also reduced by half compared with ordinary mechanized mines. Developing hydraulic mining reduces the amount of basic construction work due to the reduced number of machines, speeds up construction, and reduces investment costs by 20%-40%. Hydraulic mining can eliminate spalling, roof fall and transportation accidents.

Hydraulic mining has been widely used in countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and New Zealand. In China, it has also become one of the revolutionary new technologies in the coal industry. The use of hydraulic mining requires certain conditions, such as: the roof must be firm, the coal quality is relatively soft, there are many cracks, and any coal thickness that is mineable is applicable. Of course, this mining method also has certain shortcomings, such as greater coal loss than mechanical mining and more electricity consumption. If these shortcomings are compared with its advantages, they are insignificant. Moreover, as science develops day by day, these shortcomings will be gradually resolved with the development of science.

### 水力采煤

    水力采煤
    “水可以采煤”？这对人们来说是一种非常新奇的事情。因为水从来就是矿工的敌人，矿工从开井的第一天起就遇到了水，这些水不断从岩石或煤层缝隙里流出来，如果不及时排走，就会淹没矿井，使全矿生产停顿。为了不妨碍工作，必须不断的和敌人——水进行斗争。强大的水泵，日夜不停地在矿井里工作，每天都要排出几百吨、甚至几千吨水。谁知道这个凶恶的敌人，竟变成矿工们的朋友，人们利用它来采煤了。
    水，看上去多么平静和软弱无力。但是，经过射水工具——水力冲射机（又叫水枪，这种水枪是用几种不同并且经受得起高压的钢管连接而成的），当它在高压水泵作用下、受到三十到六十大气压以上的高压，水就会以每秒钟七十到八十公尺甚至百公尺以上的速度冲出去的时候，这种水流就显示出不平凡的威力，当它冲向煤层的时候，煤层就会被它冲成碎块。煤破碎下落以后和水混合一起，顺着铺射在巷道里的溜槽流走，这种煤浆流到一个巨大的铁筛子上，这时候，水和小于五十公厘的煤块落到筛子下的槽里，继续向前流；留在筛子上的煤块，经过筛面流进一台破碎机，破碎机把大块煤破碎到小于五十公厘，然后再使它和原先的煤浆合在一起，一同流进一个长方形的煤水池里，最后再把煤浆用煤水泵打上地面。煤浆经过沉淀送到选煤厂，选煤以后，经过干燥，就可以装车外运。这些水再回到地面的清水池里，在高压水泵的作用下，再一次被送到井下，供水枪使用。
    这样，水在采煤矿里几乎成为唯一的工作物质，它不知疲倦地为人们工作着，忽儿到井下，忽儿到井上；忽儿从水枪口喷射出冲击煤层，忽儿带着煤块在管子里流动，在这里的水，已经变成了矿工们最忠实、最听话的仆人和助手。
    水力采煤的好处很多，它可以全面革新整个矿井的生产过程，它改变了很多复杂的生产工序。过去一个采煤掌子从开头工作到运出煤来，要几十道工序。如果能使用水力采煤，那些复杂的采煤过程就可以变成单一的流水作业。在水力采煤的矿井里，看不见大大小小的机器，只能看见水枪在战斗，在水枪旁边，除了两名水枪司机以外，几乎连工人也看不到，水力产煤的劳动生产率至少可以提高四、五倍，成本也比普通机械化矿井降低一半。发展水力采煤，因为机器数量减少，基本建设工作量就少，建设速度也快，投资费用减少20％—40％。水力采煤可以免除片帮、冒顶和运输事故等。
    水力采煤已被苏联、波兰、新西兰等国家大量采用。在中国，也成为煤炭工业中具有革命意义的新技术之一。使用水力采煤要有一定的条件，例如：顶板必须坚固、煤质较软、裂纹较多，煤的厚度只要是可采的煤都可以适用。当然，这种采煤方法还有一定缺点，如煤的损失比机械采煤大，电能消耗也多，如果拿这些缺点和它的优点来比，也是微不足道的。况且，科学一天天发展，这些缺点也将会随着科学发展会逐步得到解决的。
