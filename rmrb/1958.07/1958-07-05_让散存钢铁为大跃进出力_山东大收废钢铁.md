    Let Scattered Steel Contribute to the Great Leap Forward
    Shandong Vigorously Collects Scrap Steel
    According to the Dazhong Daily, in order to support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is vigorously carrying out the work of scrap metal collection. As of the end of May, the province had collected 69.75 million jin of scrap steel and 7.46 million jin of miscellaneous copper. The scrap steel alone is enough to manufacture 390,000 double-铧 plows, or 300,000 Liberation-style waterwheels, or 180,000 ten-horsepower gas engines. These scrap metals are being supplied to urban and rural industrial production departments in a steady stream.
    The Zhangqiu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative criticized the conservative thinking of "scrap is collected every year, and there is less and less to collect." Under the leadership of the Party committee, the director took the lead, and the purchasing station chief took the lead in launching a scrap collection blitz month. Staff members participated in production during the day and brought goods to the cooperative and teams at night, while propagandizing, collecting, and supplying. In the fourteen days of June, the county collected a total of 123,500 jin of copper and 917,000 jin of scrap steel, an increase of nearly double the amount collected in the entire previous year. According to incomplete statistics in Chiping County, 1,700 people regularly participate in scrap collection. The directors, cooks, small vendors, and catering industry employees of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives all participated in this work. The county collected 150.5% of its annual plan for scrap steel, 291.2% for tin, and 127.3% for copper in one month. The Bianyuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Feicheng organized eight shock teams, and by helping 3,900 households in seventeen agricultural cooperatives clean up, it collected 1,412 jin of scrap copper, 757 jin of scrap tin, and 20,700 jin of scrap steel in half a month. The masses are very satisfied with this method.

    让散存钢铁为大跃进出力
    山东大收废钢铁
    据大众日报报道　为了支援工农业生产大跃进，山东省供销合作社大力展开废金属收购工作。到5月底止，全省已收购废钢铁六千九百七十五万斤，杂铜七百四十六万斤。仅废钢铁一项，即可制造双铧犁三十九万部，或解放式水车三十万部，或者十马力煤气机十八万部。这些废金属已在源源供应城乡工业生产部门。
    章丘县供销社批判了“废品年年收，越收越没有”的保守思想，在党委领导下，主任挂帅、采购站长一马当先，开展了废品收购突击月。职工们白天参加生产，夜里带货到社到队，边宣传，边收购，边供应。全县在6月份的十四天中，共收购铜十二万三千五百斤，废钢铁九十一万七千余斤，比去年全年收购量增长将近一倍。茌平县据不完全的统计，经常参加收购废品的有一千七百人，基层供销社的主任，炊事员、小商小贩，以及饮食业职工，都参加了这一工作。这个县在一个月内收购的废钢铁占全年计划的150.5％，锡占291.2％，铜占127.3％。肥城边院供销社组织了八个突击队，通过帮助十七处农业社的三千九百多户打扫卫生结合搜集废品，半月收购了废铜一千四百十二斤，废锡七百五十七斤，废钢铁两万零七百多斤。群众对这种办法很满意。
