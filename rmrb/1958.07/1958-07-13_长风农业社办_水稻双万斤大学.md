Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: The Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, recently established a "Double 10,000 Jin Rice University."

This university was founded on the basis of the cooperative members' large-scale experimentation with 150 mu of high-yield rice fields aimed at producing 10,000 jin per mu. In addition to attending classroom lectures, students spend part of their time cultivating the experimental fields themselves. The school requires that the annual yield of rice in their experimental fields reach double 10,000 jin per mu in order to graduate. More than 100 students have already enrolled in the first phase of study; they are all leading cadres and production activists from the cooperative. The principal is Guan Musheng, the cooperative director and a national model worker in agriculture. The teachers are experienced veteran farmers and technical cadres stationed in the cooperative.

Currently, the students are highly motivated in their studies. Their slogan is: "Dare to think, dare to do, produce double 10,000 jin per mu; be both red and expert, be rice champions!"

    长风农业社办“水稻双万斤大学”
    新华社武汉12日电　湖北省孝感县长风农业社最近创办了一所“水稻双万斤大学”。
    这所大学是在社员们大搞水稻一百五十亩万斤高产试验田的基础上创办起来的。学员除了听取教师课堂讲授外，部分时间是自己动手种试验田。学校要求他们在试验田中，每亩水稻的年产量达到双万斤，才算毕业。报名参加第一期学习的学员已有一百多人，他们都是社的领导干部和生产积极分子。校长是社主任、全国农业劳动模范官木生，教师由有经验的老农和驻社的技术干部担任。
    目前学员们的学习积极性很高，他们的口号是：“敢想敢干，亩产双万；又红又专，水稻状元”。
