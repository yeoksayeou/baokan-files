    Focus on the History After the "May Fourth" Movement
    Liu Danian
    Historical research must emphasize the present over the past. Focusing on the study of modern and contemporary Chinese history, especially the history after the "May Fourth" Movement and the history of the People's Republic of China, is the main content of emphasizing the present in historical research.
    Why "emphasize" the history after the "May Fourth" Movement? I believe this is because: First, the history after the "May Fourth" Movement is closely related to today's life. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, although imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, which hindered the development of Chinese social history, have been overthrown, the remaining forces of feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism have not been completely eliminated, and the struggle between the Chinese people and imperialist counter-revolutionaries has not ended. Capitalist ownership has been changed, but the remnants of capitalism, including bourgeois ideology, still affect people's daily lives. The status and role of the working class and peasants have changed, but the mission history has entrusted to them to build socialism has only just begun. Studying this period of history aims to help people learn from the activities of yesterday and engage in the practice of socialist construction today. Second, the history after the "May Fourth" Movement is a truly great era in Chinese history. From the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese working class stepped onto the political stage. Before this, for about eighty years, Chinese social history developed along a downward line of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. After this, it began to change to develop along an upward line, and finally entered socialist society. In this period, there were the most complex class contradictions, fervent revolutionary struggles, vivid and lively creations of Marxism-Leninism, and many things that were new in China, some of which were also new in the world, requiring scientific research and summarization. Third, to scientifically understand ancient China, we must also focus on the study of modern and contemporary China. This is the method Marxism teaches us. Although these reasons are very simple, they do demonstrate that "emphasizing" the history after the "May Fourth" Movement has extremely important practical significance.
    In the past few years, many comrades have already begun to pay attention to the study of the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, and have made significant achievements in sorting out historical materials, compiling teaching materials, conducting preliminary research, and training cadres. However, this work still lags far behind revolutionary practice and falls short of needs.
    Undoubtedly, studying the history after the "May Fourth" Movement is much more difficult than studying ancient history. Some comrades believe that these difficulties are manifested in: First, it has only been over thirty years since the "May Fourth" Movement. The time is short, there are few people engaged in academic research in this area, and even fewer experts. The main force in research was originally the teachers of revolutionary history or modern history in colleges and universities, but recently, many of them have switched to teaching socialist education courses, further reducing the workforce. Second, it is closely related to real life, making it difficult to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Having some new insights, there is fear of being criticized as revisionist; having no new insights, there is fear of being criticized as dogmatic. It is laborious and easy to run into trouble. Emphasizing the present has turned into "fearing the present." Third, materials are difficult to find. Some have been lost, some have not been published, and some are scattered and unorganized. Without new materials, no new results can be researched. Fourth, conditions are poor, mainly due to lack of time. Because there are very few professional researchers, teachers in colleges and universities are tasked with teaching and have little time to do research. And so on.
    In my opinion, these all have some truth, but only one side of the truth. To strengthen the study of the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, relevant departments do need to take some measures in terms of manpower, environment, materials, and conditions to support it. However, these difficulties must first be overcome by the academic community itself, by the researchers themselves, and these difficulties are not impossible to gradually overcome.
    The number of people engaged in "emphasizing the present" is not small today. In 1957, there were 1,400 modern history and revolutionary history teachers in colleges and universities across the country. Adding the teachers who teach revolutionary history or Party history in Party schools at all levels and secondary schools, plus the researchers in a few specialized research institutions, there is a large team of more than 10,000 people, which is more than the number of people engaged in ancient history. Although some people have recently switched to teaching socialist education courses, which do not systematically teach history, the issues involved are mostly related to Party history or revolutionary history, and the connection with practice is even closer. They may still be able to do some research work related to Party history or modern history to a greater or lesser extent. Even if the majority of them are not yet highly skilled, as long as they conscientiously learn while doing, they can gradually improve their skills. It seems that the modern history research team is not suffering from a shortage of people, but from a lack of the spirit of diligent study while working. Lack of data is an objective situation that cannot be ignored. It is very important to pay attention to collecting and organizing data. However, as long as manpower is organized to do it, some basic data is not difficult to collect and organize. For example, recently, some departments have compiled "Collections of Materials on Modern Chinese History," "Materials on Modern Chinese Industrial History," and "Materials on Modern Chinese Agricultural History," which are very good works. Organizing data mainly relies on researchers themselves. To simply wait for others to organize the data before doing research oneself would be as futile as climbing a tree to catch fish. As for saying that some Party documents are not easy to find for the time being, this situation does exist, but even if some unpublished materials are found, they may not be usable. Moreover, this situation has changed recently. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the large number of Party documents that have been published, such as various resolutions and instructions, are the basic documents for our study of Party history and modern history. Historical research relies on analyzing the largest amount and most common materials to draw conclusions, rather than relying on mastering certain rare and secret books to be unconventional. This is one of the fundamental differences between us and the bourgeois viewpoint, and it is a characteristic of Marxist research. Comrade Chen Boda's works on modern Chinese history are very good examples. The materials cited in books such as "The Four Big Families of China" and "Chiang Kai-shek, Public Enemy of the People" are nothing more than materials selected from general newspapers and books, but no one can deny that these works are highly ideological and scientific. Therefore, the difficulty of data is not enough to constitute a reason for "fearing the present." On the contrary, it should prompt us to intensify our work. Historical research requires letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. This is beyond doubt. Currently, the atmosphere of free debate in academic research is not strong enough, and discussions of various different opinions need to be promoted. We must encourage the courage to express opinions, dare to create boldly, and dare to criticize boldly. Of course, the study of modern history is no exception. If, because modern history is closely related to current life and there are more opportunities for criticism, this is nothing to be afraid of. It will only promote the continuous deepening of research work. Letting a hundred schools of thought contend originally includes two meanings: free research and free criticism. Without the freedom for others to criticize wrong ideas and wrong styles, only the freedom to publish original ideas, there would be no contention, only a lone duck and no sunset glow, which would not be "contention," and not "the sunset glow and the lone duck flying together." We must have contention and debate side by side. Some people worry that in the research and discussion of modern history, it is easy to mix academic issues with political issues. These two things are certainly related, but there is a distinction. To distinguish between these two things and create an environment for free research, it mainly depends on the academic community being able to conduct academic criticism correctly. In short, difficulties in manpower, data, and conditions do exist. It depends on how we treat them. Researchers should not undermine their own prestige and should not be intimidated by these difficulties.
    More importantly, we must see that studying the history after the "May Fourth" Movement has some advantages compared to studying ancient history. First of all, this research has the attention and support of the leading organs. As far as Party history is concerned, the Party Central Committee has always regarded strengthening the study of Party history as an effective method for strengthening Marxist-Leninist education. The fact that Party history and revolutionary history courses are commonly offered in colleges and universities, Party schools at all levels, and some secondary schools is enough to show this. Also, because this period of history has been studied very little, there is a vast field to be cultivated. Even simply organizing materials carefully can produce results. In particular, because this work is closely related to real life, it has a certain value and immediately has a positive impact among the masses. For example, a valuable work on modern history often sells tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of copies. A book with so many readers has a considerable impact. This shows that the author bears a great responsibility, and at the same time, it is a great encouragement to the author.
    If the above views are roughly correct, this shows that we not only need to strengthen the study of the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, but we are also fully capable of strengthening research in this area. The key is to have methods and measures. I think the methods that can be adopted are: First, organize the scattered manpower through various specific tasks. For example, organize manpower to compile larger-scale works on modern Chinese history, the history of the People's Republic of China, and related specialized works; systematically organize newspapers and other important materials since the "May Fourth" Movement; investigate and visit important events and related figures in various regions and periods; and hold academic conferences in a planned way. Second, set up research bases for modern history and Party history according to local conditions. If possible, consider asking relevant departments to establish a national center for modern history and Party history research. Third, there are many topics that need to be researched in the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, and the scope involved is very wide. Relevant units should formulate topic selection plans at any time according to needs for researchers to refer to and choose from. I believe that the most important thing at present is to focus on studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the construction of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class, the struggle between Marxist ideology and bourgeois ideology, socialist transformation, and socialist construction, and other fundamental and key issues. Many issues raised in real life, such as the bourgeois democratic and free thought and bourgeois nationalism displayed during the Rightists' attack, are related to modern history and should also be studied separately from a historical perspective. Fourth, do a good job in publishing and reviewing. This includes actively preparing conditions, creating modern history publications, and existing history publications and university journals and other comprehensive publications that publish history manuscripts should have an appropriate division of labor. Some publications can focus on publishing modern history articles, forming their own focus and characteristics. Specialized history publications should strive to publish articles on modern history in each issue. Strengthen the review of relevant works in newspapers and periodicals, and give timely encouragement and support to those with certain achievements.
    There are many other methods. With methods, designate responsible units to implement them separately. After a period of effort, the current situation will definitely change.
    Of course, it is not necessarily "emphasizing the present" if one studies the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, and otherwise it is necessarily "emphasizing the past." The question is how you study it. If those engaged in this period of history still evoke nostalgic feelings and study for the sake of research, then even problems with real significance will become antiques, and there will be no emphasis on the present. Therefore, the study of the history after the "May Fourth" Movement must still implement the principle of linking with actual life and starting from current needs, and cannot deviate from or modify this principle.
    There are differences in understanding here. In the academic community, on the issue of the relationship between academics and life, that is, the relationship between academics and politics, there have been, and still are, two viewpoints and two standards for measuring things. One is the bourgeois viewpoint. According to this viewpoint, academics are just something in an ivory tower, the most noble and independent. Those who conform to this are called academics, and those who engage in them are called knowledgeable and experts. Those who oppose this cannot be called academics, but only engage in politics, which is neither noble nor independent. The other is the Marxist viewpoint. According to this viewpoint, a certain culture is a reflection of the politics and economy of a certain society in the form of ideology. So-called academics, theories, or socio-historical theories all reflect a certain politics and economy, and directly or indirectly serve a certain politics and economy. Ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign academic works prove that the Marxist viewpoint is an irrefutable truth, while the bourgeois viewpoint is extremely hypocritical. Confucius's "Spring and Autumn Annals" is revered as a "classic," and of course it is a typical academic work, but Confucius wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals" and "treacherous ministers and rebellious sons feared," which shows that its content was not so "independent" and did not break away from politics. Sima Guang's revision of "Zizhi Tongjian" had a clear political purpose. He made it very clear in his "Memorial on Presenting the Book" that this book was compiled according to the feudalist viewpoint, "specifically taking what concerns the rise and fall of the country, the well-being of the people, and what is good can be taken as a model, and what is evil can be taken as a warning." Morse's "The International Relations of the Chinese Empire" is a book that preaches for imperialist aggression against China; the "academic works" of Jiang Tingfu, Hu Shi, and others on modern and contemporary Chinese history aim to defend the comprador class's betrayal of national interests. Throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, there has never been a history book unrelated to politics. History books reflect contemporary political viewpoints, with only direct and indirect differences. Relatively systematic and important history books have always been political textbooks. The question is that history books that reflect a certain political viewpoint are more in line with history and science, while those that reflect another political viewpoint are not in line with history and science, and are even fundamentally anti-historical and anti-scientific. The bourgeois viewpoint on academic research and the standards for measuring academic works, like its viewpoint on other things, reflects the serious limitations of this class in understanding the objective world and reflects the essence of the exploiting class. Even today, it is too unreasonable for us to allow this erroneous thinking to block our minds and bind our hands and feet. Those engaged in the study of modern and contemporary history must thoroughly expose the hypocritical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie and establish a Marxist viewpoint. We are happy to have no bourgeois academics, and we only need Marxist academics.
    Currently, there are indeed difficulties in the study of the history after the "May Fourth" Movement, but there are also indeed solutions. As long as we all take action, we will definitely be able to gradually overcome the difficulties, make a great leap forward, and promote the development of this cause.

    要着重研究“五四”运动以后的历史
    刘大年
    历史研究必须厚今薄古。着重研究中国近代现代史，特别是着重研究“五四”运动以后的历史、中华人民共和国的历史，这是历史研究中厚今的主要内容。
    为什么要“厚”“五四”以后的历史呢？我以为这是因为：一，“五四”以后的历史和今天的生活息息相关。“五四”以来，阻碍中国社会历史发展的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义虽然已被推翻，但是封建主义和官僚资本主义的残余势力还未完全肃清，中国人民与帝国主义反革命之间的斗争并未结束。资本主义所有制已经改变，但是资本主义的残余、包括资产阶级思想，还影响着人们的日常生活。工人阶级和农民的地位、作用都起了变化，而历史赋予他们的建设社会主义的使命，却只是刚刚开始。研究这段历史，目的是要帮助人们从昨天的活动中吸取经验，来从事今天社会主义建设的实践。二，“五四”以后的历史，是中国历史上真正伟大的时代。从“五四”起，中国工人阶级走上了政治舞台。在这以前的中国社会历史，约八十年间是沿着半封建半殖民地的下降线发展的，在这以后，开始改变为沿上升线发展，最后进到了社会主义社会。在这个时期里，有最复杂的阶级矛盾，有火热的革命斗争，有生动活泼的马克思列宁主义思想的创造，有许多在中国是新的东西，有一些在世界上也是新的东西，需要进行科学的研究和总结。三，要科学地了解中国的古代，也必须着重研究中国的近代和现代，这是马克思主义告诉我们的方法。这些理由虽然很简单，它确实说明“厚”“五四”以后的历史有极其重大的现实意义。
    过去几年中，有不少同志已经开始注重研究“五四”以后的历史，在整理史料、编写讲义、进行初步研究和培养干部等方面有显著成绩。然而这个工作仍远远地落后于革命的实际，落后于需要。
    毫无疑问，研究“五四”以后的历史，要比搞古代史困难许多。有的同志认为这些困难表现在：一，“五四”至今不过三十多年，时间短、从事这方面的学术研究的人少，专家更少，力量不足、水平不高。本来高等学校的革命史或现代史教师是研究的主力，近来其中有不少人改教社会主义教育课程，人力更为减少。二，和现实生活联系密切，不易贯彻百家争鸣。有点新见解，怕被批评为修正主义，没有新见解，则怕被批评为教条主义。吃力而又容易碰钉子，厚今变成了“怕今”。三，材料不好找。有的已经散失，有的尚未发表，有的零散没有整理。没有新材料研究不出什么新名堂。四，条件差，主要是没有时间。因为专业研究的人很少，高等学校教师的任务是教课，很少有时间做研究。如此等等。
    照我的想法，这些都有一定的道理，但是只有一面的道理。要加强“五四”以后历史的研究，确实需要有关部门在人力、环境、材料和条件等方面采取一些措施，加以支持。然而这些困难，首先是要由学术界本身，要研究者本人来努力克服，并且这些困难也并不是不可以逐渐克服的。
    从事“厚今”的人今天已不在少数。1957年全国高等学校有现代史和革命史教师一千四百人，加上各级党校和中等学校里教授革命史或党史的教员，再加上少数专业研究机构的研究人员，有一支万人以上的庞大队伍，和搞古代史的人数相比，有过之而无不及。虽然近来有些人改教社会主义教育课程，不是有系统地讲历史，但是所涉及的问题，多半和党史或革命史有关，而且与实际结合更加紧密，他们仍有可能或多或少做一些有关党史或现代史的研究工作。即使其中多数人目前水平还不高，只要认真边干边学，就可能逐步提高自己的水平。看来现代史研究的队伍是不患寡，而患边干边学时刻苦钻研的劲头不足。资料缺乏是一个不容忽视的客观情况。注意搜集整理资料是十分重要的。但是，只要组织人力去做，有些基本资料还不难收集整理出来。例如最近有些部门汇编出“中国现代史资料丛刊”、“中国近代工业史资料”、“中国近代农业史资料”等，就是做得很好的工作。整理资料主要靠研究者自己动手，一味想等着别人整理好资料以后自己去研究，那会像缘木求鱼一样没有效果。至于说有些党的文献一时不易找到，这种情况是有的，但是有些未经发表的材料即使找到了，也未必可以利用。并且，近来这方面的情况已有改变。“毛泽东选集”和已经发表的大批党的文件，如各种决议指示等，是我们研究党史、研究现代历史的基本文件。历史研究要靠对最大量、最普遍的材料进行分析、作出结论，而不是依靠掌握某些孤本秘笈，来标新立异。这是我们和资产阶级观点的根本分歧之一，是马克思主义研究的特色。陈伯达同志研究中国现代史的著作是很好的典型，“中国四大家族”、“人民公敌蒋介石”等书上面所引用的材料，也无非是从一般报刊、书籍上选择出来的材料，但是谁也不能否认这些著作是思想性很强、科学性很高的著作。所以资料困难，并不足以构成“怕今”的理由，相反的应该推动我们加紧工作。历史研究需要百花齐放、百家争鸣这是无人怀疑的。目前学术研究中自由辩论的空气还不浓厚，需要提倡各种不同意见的讨论。要鼓励敢于发表意见，敢于大胆创造、大胆批评的勇气。现代史的研究当然也不例外。如果因为现代史和当前生活关系密切、受批评的机会较多，这也并没有什么可怕。这只会推动研究工作的不断深入。百家争鸣本来就包含着两个意思：自由研究和自由批评。没有别人批评错误思想、错误作风的自由，只有发表创见的自由，那就会是有鸣无争，会是只有孤鹜而无落霞，那就不成其为“争鸣”，不成其为“落霞与孤鹜齐飞”。我们要有鸣有争，要边鸣边争。有人耽心在现代史的研究讨论中，容易把学术问题和政治问题混在一起。这两件事当然有联系，但它是有区别的。要区分这两件事、创造自由研究的环境，主要靠学术界能够正确地进行学术批评。总之，人力、资料、条件等方面困难是有的，要看如何对待。研究者不要灭自己的威风，不能被这些困难吓倒。
    更重要的是我们必须看到，研究“五四”以后的历史比搞古代史还有些有利的条件。首先这方面的研究有领导机关的重视和支持。就党史而言，我们党的中央历来把加强党史学习，作为加强马克思列宁主义教育的有效方法。以往高等学校、各级党校和一些中等学校里普遍设有党史和革命史课程，就足以表明这一点。又由于这段历史研究得很少，有广阔的园地可以垦殖。甚至只要认真去整理材料，就可以见出成效。特别是这个工作因为和现实生活密切有关，多少有点价值，立刻就在群众中发生有利的影响。举个例子：一本有参考价值的有关现代史的作品，往往要销行几万册，乃至几十万册。一本书有那么多的人阅读，影响可谓不小。这说明作者负有极大的责任，同时，这对作者也是极大的鼓励。
    上述看法要是大致不错，这表明我们不但需要加强“五四”以后历史的研究，而且我们也完全有可能来加强这方面的研究。事情在于要有办法、有措施。我想可以采取的办法有这样一些：一，通过各项具体工作把分散的人力组织起来。例如组织人力，编写分量较大的中国现代史、中华人民共和国史和有关的专门著作，有系统的整理“五四”以来的报刊和其他重要资料，调查访问各地区、各时期的重要事件和有关人物，有计划的举办学术会议等。二，因地制宜，设置现代史和党史的研究据点，如果能办到，可以提请有关部门考虑建立全国性的现代史和党史研究的中心。三，“五四”以后的历史需要研究的题目很多，涉及的范围很广，应由有关的单位随时根据需要，拟制选题计划，供研究者参考选择。我以为当前最重要的是要着重研究毛泽东同志的著作、中国共产党的建设、中国工人阶级、马克思主义思想与资产阶级思想的斗争、社会主义改造和社会主义建设等这些根本性和关键性的问题。实际生活中提出的许多问题，如右派进攻时所表现出来的资产阶级的民主自由思想，资产阶级民族主义等，都和现代历史有关，也应从历史角度来分别加以研究。四，要做好出版、评论工作。这包括积极准备条件、创办现代史刊物，现有历史刊物和登载历史稿件的高等学校学报及其他综合性刊物要适当分工，有些刊物可以着重登载现代史的文章，形成自己的重点和特色。专门的历史刊物，争取每期都有一定的篇幅刊载现代史的文章。要加强报刊上有关这方面的作品的评论，有一定成绩的及时给以鼓励支持。
    其他办法还很多。有了办法，再推定负责的单位，分别实行。经过一个时候的努力，目前的状况一定可以改变。
    当然，不是凡属研究“五四”以后的历史，就必然是厚今，否则就必然是厚古。问题还看你怎样去研究。假使搞这段历史的人，照样是发思古之幽情，为研究而研究，那就使有现实性的问题变成了古董，无厚今之可言。因此，研究“五四”以后的历史，仍必须贯彻联系实际生活，从当前需要出发的原则，不能脱离或修改这个原则。
    这里是存在着认识上的分歧的。学术界在学术和生活的关系问题上，亦即学术和政治的关系问题上，过去是、现在仍然是有两种观点，有两根衡量事物的尺子。一种是资产阶级观点。照这种观点，学术生就只是象牙之塔里的东西，是最清高、最有独立性的。合乎此者就叫做学术，搞的人就叫做有学问，是专家。反乎此者就不能叫做学术，只是搞政治，是既不清高，又无独立性。再一种是马克思主义观点。照这种观点，一定的文化是一定社会的政治和经济在观念形态上的反映。所谓学术、学理或社会历史学说，都是反映着一定的政治和经济，又直接间接地为一定的政治和经济服务。古今中外的学术著作证明马克思主义观点是颠扑不破的真理，而资产阶级观点则极端虚伪。孔子的“春秋”被尊为“经”，当然是典型的学术了，但是孔子作春秋而“乱臣贼子惧”，足见其内容并不那么“独立”，并未脱离政治。司马光修资治通鉴有明确的政治目的，他在“进书表”上说得很清楚，这部书是按照封建主义观点，“专取关国家盛衰，系生民休戚，善可为法，恶可为戒者”编辑而成的。马士的“中华帝国对外关系史”是一部为帝国主义侵略中国说教的书；蒋廷黻、胡适之流讲中国近代、现代史的“学术著作”，其目的是为买办阶级出卖民族利益辩护。古今中外从来没有与政治无关的历史书，历史书没有不反映当时的政治观点的，只有直接和间接的区别。比较有系统的重要的历史书一向是政治教科书。问题是在于反映某一种政治观点的历史书比较合乎历史，合乎科学，而反映另一种政治观点的则不合历史、不合科学，乃至是根本是反历史、反科学的。资产阶级对待学术研究的观点、衡量学术著作的尺子和它对待其他事物的观点一样，是反映了这个阶级认识客观世界的严重拘限性，反映了剥削阶级的实质。时至今天，我们还让这种错误思想闭塞住头脑，束缚住手脚，那是太无道理了。研究近代现代史的人，在这个问题上必须彻底揭穿资产阶级的虚伪观点，树立起马克思主义观点。我们甘心情愿没有资产阶级的学术，我们只需要有马克思主义的学术。
    目前有关“五四”以后历史的研究，确是有困难，但也确是有办法。只要我们大家行动起来，就一定能够逐渐克服困难，来一番大跃进，促成这个事业的发展。
