In the past, rain brought disaster, this year heavy rain doesn't cause flooding.
Water Conservancy Projects Display Great Power
Yongcheng, Henan Sheds "Old Disaster Area" Label
Lin Yi Prefecture, Shandong Endures First Heavy Rain Test

(Reported by this newspaper) Yongcheng County, Henan, water conservancy projects, after enduring the severe test of continuous heavy rainfall of 420 millimeters, have demonstrated great power.

Yongcheng is a low-lying, flood-prone area. In the past, it was characterized by "major disasters with heavy rain, minor disasters with light rain, and drought without rain." Of the county's two million mu of cultivated land, in normal years, over 900,000 mu were affected by disasters. Even in the bumper year of 1955, over 500,000 mu of autumn crops were flooded. Therefore, Yongcheng had long been labeled an "old disaster area." Since last winter, the people of the county have implemented the "three-main" water management principle, resolutely executing the correct instructions of the provincial and prefectural committees to shed the disaster area label in one year. They worked hard throughout the winter and spring. In water conservancy construction, the county built 2,880 new ponds with an area of 33,069 mu, renovated 3,615 old ponds with an area of 19,354 mu, dredged 952 large and small rivers with a length of 5,306 li, and excavated nine medium and small reservoirs with an area of 2,697 mu. These water conservancy projects displayed their power during the heavy rain in early July this year. On July 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, heavy rain fell, with rainfall reaching 420 millimeters in some areas and generally around 300 millimeters, with additional water entering the area from outside. This level of rainfall was unprecedented in Yongcheng County's history. Under such circumstances, there was no disaster. Instead, it had a greatly beneficial effect on various crops, especially rice transplanting, sweet potato planting, and the growth of autumn seedlings.

Although Yongcheng County has achieved great success on the water conservancy front, the people of the county are not complacent. They are now vigorously engaged in water conservancy, advancing towards a network of rivers and canals.

(Reported by this newspaper) Various soil and water conservation projects in Lin Yi Prefecture, Shandong Province, have withstood their first heavy rain test, proving their effectiveness and playing a significant role in controlling soil erosion and reducing flooding.

Since last winter, Lin Yi Prefecture has treated 5,876 large and small hills, and the constructed fish-scale pits, intercepting ditches, reservoirs, terraces combining two functions, and reservoirs have controlled soil erosion over an area of 7,500 square kilometers. Reservoirs, ditches, and pits can store a total of over 480 million cubic meters of water. From June 29th to July 3rd, the average rainfall in the entire region was 154 millimeters. Based on a 40% infiltration rate, the entire region could generate 1.897 billion cubic meters of runoff. However, due to the control of the above projects, the actual runoff generated was only 797 million cubic meters. The three large reservoirs in the region have essentially controlled the floods of three rivers. The governance projects in Longshan, Ju County, under continuous rainfall of 100 millimeters, saw all 80,000 fish-scale pits filled with water, none of which were damaged. Horizontal ditches and terraces have also played a good role. The Longshan River at the foot of the mountain used to flood after 100 millimeters of rain; this year, the river water was reduced by half. In Sunzu Township and Yiwen Township in Yinan County, rainfall exceeded 100 millimeters. After the rain, a new phenomenon of clear water slowly flowing down the mountains appeared. The masses said: Thanks to the Communist Party for leading us in soil and water conservation, we no longer have to worry about mountain floods.

### 往年下雨灾害多　今年大雨不下坡  水利工程发挥巨大威力  河南永城摘掉“老灾区”帽子　山东临沂专区经受住首次大雨考验

    往年下雨灾害多　今年大雨不下坡
    水利工程发挥巨大威力
    河南永城摘掉“老灾区”帽子
  　山东临沂专区经受住首次大雨考验
    本报讯　河南永城县水利建设工程，经过连降大雨四百二十公厘的严重考验，显示了巨大威力。
    永城是个低洼易涝地区，过去是“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，不雨旱灾”。全县二百万亩耕地，一般年景，受灾面积达九十多万亩，在丰收的1955年，还有五十多万亩秋季作物被淹，因此，永城一直戴着“老灾区”的帽子。从去年冬季以来，全县人民贯彻了“三主”治水方针，坚决地执行了省、地委关于一年摘掉灾区帽子的正确指示，大干了一个冬、春，在水利建设上，全县共打新塘两千八百八十个，面积三万三千零六十九亩，整修旧塘三千六百一十五个，面积一万九千三百五十四亩，疏通大小河道九百五十二条，长五千三百零六华里，开挖中、小型水库九个，面积两千六百九十七亩。这些水利工程，在今年7月初的一次大雨中，大显威力。7月2日、3日、5日三天猛降大雨，降雨量多的达四百二十公厘，一般在三百公厘左右，并且还有客水进境。这次降雨量之大在永城县还是有史以来的第一次。在这样的情况下，不但没有灾害，而且对各种农作物，尤其是水稻插秧、红芋栽种和秋苗生长，却起了大大有利的作用。
    永城县在水利战线上虽然取得了很大的胜利，但全县人民并不骄傲。现在，正在大搞水利，向河网化进军。
    本报讯　山东省临沂专区各项治山治水工程，经过了第一次大雨的考验，证明效能良好，在控制水土流失和减轻水患方面发挥了巨大的作用。
    去冬以来，临沂专区共治理了大小山头五千八百七十六个，修建的鱼鳞坑、截水沟、蓄水池、二合一梯田、水库塘坝等工程，共可控制水土流失面积七千五百平方公里，水库塘坝、沟洫、坑塘等共可蓄水四亿八千多万立方。自6月29 日到7月3日，全区平均降雨一百五十四公厘，按40％的渗透率计算，全区可产生径流十八亿九千七百万立方；但由于上述工程的控制，实际产生的径流只有七亿九千七百万立方。全区三个大型水库，基本上控制了三条河流的洪水。莒县龙山的治理工程，在连续降雨一百公厘的情况下，八万多个鱼鳞坑，坑坑存水，没有一个被冲坏的，水平沟、梯田都发挥了良好的效能。山下的龙山河，往年下一百公厘雨就泛滥成灾；今年河水减少了一半。沂南县孙祖乡和依汶乡降雨一百公厘以上，雨后出现了清水缓缓流下山的新气象，群众说：多亏共产党领导咱治山，今后不用担心山洪暴发了。
