Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: TASS reports: The Soviet armed forces now possess not only all kinds of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, all kinds of jet and rocket weapons, and long-range rockets, but also top-notch jet aircraft capable of completing any task, possessing all types of aircraft necessary to defend the country and guarantee the needs of the national economy. This was stated by Soviet Air Force Lieutenant General Retov to a TASS reporter on the occasion of the 25th Soviet Aviation Day on July 20th.

Retov said that currently, Soviet aircraft designers are solving new problems in aircraft manufacturing. They are manufacturing engines that allow aircraft to fly in the stratosphere and at speeds one to three times the speed of sound.

He also said that unmanned aircraft are also beginning to develop. This will greatly improve the combat capability of the army. With the solution of supersonic and cosmic speed problems, and with the application of manned and unmanned aircraft, military aviation technology and its application in combat have been further developed.

Retov, in retracing the glorious history of Soviet aviation, said that as early as around 1930, the bombers and interceptors manufactured by Soviet aircraft designers already surpassed foreign aircraft of the same type in many respects in terms of flight quality. Top-notch Soviet-made aircraft enabled Soviet pilots to set world records for long-distance, high-altitude, and high-speed flight. By the end of 1939, the Soviet Union ranked first in the world in terms of the number of world flight records set.

Retov said that during the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Air Force played an extremely important role. More than two thousand Soviet pilots were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The Soviet aircraft industry produced 40,000 aircraft annually between 1943 and 1945.

    苏联空军威力强大无比
    拥有各种头等喷气飞机
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联武装力量现在不仅拥有各种原子武器和热核武器、各种喷气武器和火箭武器、远程火箭，而且还有能够完成任何任务的头等喷气式飞机，拥有保卫国家和保证国民经济需要所必需的一切类型的飞机。这是苏联空军中将雷托夫就7月20日苏联第二十五届航空节向塔斯社记者发表谈话时说的。
    雷托夫说，目前，苏联飞机设计人员正在解决飞机制造方面的一些新问题，他们正在制造可以使飞机在同温层飞行并以超过声速一倍到三倍的速度飞行的发动机。
    他还说，无人驾驶飞机也开始发展。这样就可以大大提高军队的战斗能力。随着超音速和宇宙速度问题的解决，随着有人驾驶和无人驾驶飞机的应用，军事航空技术及其在战斗中的应用得到了进一步发展。
    雷托夫在回溯苏联航空事业的光辉历史时说，早在1930年左右，苏联飞机设计师所制造的轰炸机和歼灭机，就飞行的质量来说，在许多方面就已经超过了外国的同类型的飞机。苏联国产的头等飞机使得苏联飞行员能够创造出远航、高航和快航的世界纪录。1939年底，苏联在创造世界飞行纪录的数目方面就占世界第一位。
    雷托夫说，在伟大的卫国战争时期中，苏联空军起了极其重大的作用。有两千多名苏联飞行员获得苏联英雄的称号。苏联飞机制造业在1943年到1945年间每年生产四万架飞机。
