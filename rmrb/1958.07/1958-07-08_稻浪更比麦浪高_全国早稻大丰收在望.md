Rice Waves Higher Than Wheat Waves
National Early Rice Harvest in Sight

(Our report) This year, the country's early rice crop will achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to the Ministry of Agriculture's estimate, if there are no major natural disasters in the next half month or so, the early rice yield will greatly exceed that of last year.

This year, the country has planted more than 157 million mu of early rice, an expansion of more than 37 million mu compared to last year. Currently, the early rice in Hainan Island has been completely harvested; Guangdong, Yunnan, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces have successively begun harvesting; Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces will begin harvesting in mid to late July. The good news of early rice bumper harvests is constantly coming from all over the country. It is estimated that the early rice yield in general areas of Guangdong Province will increase by 40%-60% this year compared to last year, and in some areas it will increase by more than double. In Shantou Prefecture in this province—the first prefecture in the country to achieve 800 jin of grain per mu—the average early rice yield per mu will reach more than 460 jin this year, an increase of 100 jin compared to last year. According to the recent provincial production inspection meeting convened by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, the province's more than 20 million mu of early rice can yield an average of 550 jin of rice per mu, with a total output of 11 billion jin, more than double that of last year. The 1.7 million mu of early rice along the Jiulong River in Fujian Province generally have longer ears and larger grains than last year. The harvested areas have been measured practically, and generally the yields have increased by 70-80% compared to last year. In Sichuan Province, with the start of the early rice harvest, the good news of high yields from along the thousands of miles of the Yangtze River are connected like waves, rising higher and higher, and reports of high yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu over large areas are constantly being reported. Hubei, Zhejiang, and other provinces, which are about to begin harvesting, are estimated to have significantly higher yields per mu and total yields than last year, according to field inspections in many areas. In Mianyang County, Hubei Province, after block-by-block surveys and calculations, more than 40,000 mu of the 85,000 mu of early rice can yield more than 1,000 jin of rice.

The early rice harvest and the late rice transplanting are carried out simultaneously. Therefore, this period is the most intense period of agricultural work in rice-producing areas. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage and ensure timely harvesting and transplanting, in addition to rationally organizing labor, running agricultural busy season canteens and nurseries, and mobilizing more people to participate in the rush harvesting and transplanting, many areas have also led farmers to improve harvesting and transplanting tools and have carried out extensive promotion. Farmers in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, have created a method of transporting grain bundles using seedling boats, which can not only increase work efficiency by 50% but also avoid scattering grains. This method is being promoted in Luzhou Prefecture, and the entire prefecture can harvest an additional 30 million jin of rice due to reduced losses. The staff of the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Tool Experimental Factory have created a rapid rice harvester, which is being promoted in various places. Farmers using it to harvest can increase labor efficiency several times. Yueyang County, Hunan Province, has promoted the "Ge Nanpu" method that farmers in Xujiapai Township have used for many years, and the entire county can save and transfer more than 200,000 workdays for rushing to transplant late rice. Farmers and handicraft cooperative members in various parts of Zhejiang Province have created more than 150 kinds of rice transplanters. Many special and county leading organs have held special meetings to conduct trials and appraisals, and promotion has now begun.

The increase in the national early rice area (that is, the double-cropping rice area) and the impending bumper harvest are the results of the Party leading the broad masses of farmers to vigorously build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer under the slogan of going all out and aiming high; it is also the result of fully implementing yield-increasing measures such as cultivating strong seedlings, transplanting early, and rational close planting, and waging a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as drought, floods, and pests. The early rice bumper harvest following the summer grain bumper harvest has once again taught a lesson to the "wait-and-see faction" and the "reckoning-after-the-autumn faction." Based on the fact that agricultural production has been continuously leaping forward in the past half year, the broad masses of farmers have greater confidence and greater enthusiasm in striving for greater leaps forward. Many farmers in rice-producing areas visit and compare each other's high-yield fields, summarize early rice high-yield experiences, prepare for next year, and prepare to apply these experiences to late rice production in order to strive for a greater late rice harvest.

### 稻浪更比麦浪高  全国早稻大丰收在望

    稻浪更比麦浪高
    全国早稻大丰收在望
    本报讯  今年全国早稻将获得空前大丰收。据农业部估计：在今后半月左右的时间内如无特大自然灾害，早稻产量将大大超过去年。
    今年全国共计种植早稻一亿五千七百多万亩，比去年扩大三千七百多万亩。目前，海南岛的早稻已经收完；广东、云南、福建、四川、湖南、江西等省已经先后开始收割；浙江、江苏、湖北、安徽等省将在本月中下旬相继开镰。早稻大丰收的喜讯，不断从各地传来。据估计：广东省一般地区今年早稻产量将比去年增产40％—60％，部分地区增产一倍以上。这个省的汕头专区——全国第一个亩产粮食八百斤的专区，今年全区早稻每亩平均将达四百六十多斤，比去年增产一百斤。湖南省的二千多万亩早稻，根据省委最近召集的全省生产检查会议估计，平均每亩可产稻谷五百五十斤，总产量将达一百一十亿斤，比去年增加一倍以上。福建省九龙江两岸的一百七十万亩早稻，普遍比去年长的穗长粒大，已经收割的经过实打实测，一般都比去年增产七、八成。四川省随着早稻收割的开始，来自千里长江沿岸的高产喜讯，浪浪相连，越涨越高，大面积的千斤以上的高额产量喜报不断传出。即将开始收割的湖北、浙江等省，据不少地区的田间检查估计，每亩产量和总产量都将大大超过去年。湖北省沔阳县的八万五千亩早稻，经过逐块摸底测算，有四万多亩可产稻谷千斤以上。
    早稻收割和晚稻栽插是同时进行的。因此，这个时期是水稻产区农活最紧张的时期。为了解决劳动力不足的问题，保证及时收打和栽插，很多地区除合理组织劳动力、举办农忙食堂和托儿所，发动更多的人参加抢收抢插外，还领导农民改良收、插工具，并且进行大量推广。四川省富顺县农民创造了用秧船放运谷把的办法，不仅能提高工效50％，还可避免抛撒谷子。这个办法正在沪州专区推广，全区可因减少损失多收稻谷三千万斤。福建省农具试验厂职工创造的水稻快速收割器，正在各地推广。农民用它收割，劳动效率可提高几倍。湖南省岳阳县推广了许家牌乡农民沿用了多年的“割南铺”的办法，全县可以节省和调剂出二十多万个工用于抢插晚稻。浙江省各地农民和手工业社社员创制了一百五十多种水稻插秧机，很多专、县领导机关都召开专门会议，进行了试验和鉴定，现在已经开始推广。
    全国早稻面积（也就是双季稻面积）的增加和即将获得大丰收，是党领导广大农民在鼓足干劲力争上游的口号下，大力兴修水利和积肥的结果；也是全力推行培育壮秧、早插早栽、合理密植等增产措施并和旱、涝、病虫害等自然灾害作了顽强斗争的结果。继夏粮大丰收之后的早稻大丰收，再一次给“观潮派”和“秋后算账派”上了一课。广大农民根据过去半年来农业生产不断跃进的事实，争取更大跃进的信心更高，劲头更大。很多水稻产区的农民，到丰产田里参观评比，总结早稻丰产经验，为明年进行准备，并准备把这些经验用于晚稻生产，争取晚稻更大丰收。
