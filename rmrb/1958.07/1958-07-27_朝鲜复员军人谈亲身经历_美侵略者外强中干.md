Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 25th. Demobilized soldiers of the Korean People's Army working at the Pyongyang Grain Production Factory spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters today, condemning the armed aggression of U.S. and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan, and using their personal experiences of fighting against the U.S. aggressors to expose the U.S. as a paper tiger.

    Choi Dong-soo, a worker in the starch workshop of the Pyongyang Grain Production Factory, said that the Korean people resolutely stand with the Arab people. The armed aggression of U.S. and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan is not only a serious threat to Arab countries, but also to world peace. The Korean people resolutely demand that the U.S. and British aggressor troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan, and that U.S. troops get out of South Korea.

    Choi Dong-soo served as a reconnaissance squad leader in a certain unit of the Korean People's Army during the Korean War. He said that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, tough in appearance but frail inside, and this was fully proven in the Korean War. He said that during the Korean War, they fought against the U.S. Marine Corps First Division, the U.S. military's ace unit, and he and his five comrades wiped out one of its platoons in one instance, and captured three American bandits alive. He said that although the U.S. military has new weapons, it is not scary at all, and it can be defeated as long as the people unite. He expressed his belief that the Arab people, striving for national liberation, will surely achieve victory with the support of peace-loving people all over the world.

    Choi Dong-soo said that they will take practical actions, working hard to increase production in their peaceful construction posts, to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and support the national liberation struggle of the Arab people.

    Kim Deok-jun, the workshop foreman of the same factory's fruit pastry workshop and a demobilized soldier, condemned the U.S. and British imperialist armed aggression against the Middle East and the threatening of world peace.

    This veteran soldier, who participated in famous battles such as the Nakdong River and "Heartbreak Ridge" during the Korean War, said that in the Nakdong River campaign, their unit killed or wounded more than 13,000 U.S. troops, and destroyed or captured more than 20 tanks and 40 artillery pieces. He said that the blustering and brandishing imperialists are not scary at all, and the fact that the Korean people defeated U.S. imperialism with the support of socialist countries and peace-loving people around the world is proof of this.

    朝鲜复员军人谈亲身经历
    美侵略者外强中干
    新华社平壤25日电　在平壤谷产工厂工作的朝鲜人民军复员军人今天对新华社记者发表谈话，谴责美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略行为，并且以亲身打击美国侵略军的经验戳穿美国纸老虎。
    平壤谷产工厂淀粉车间工人崔东洙说，朝鲜人民坚决同阿拉伯人民站在一起。美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装侵略不仅是对阿拉伯国家，也是对世界和平的一个严重威胁。朝鲜人民坚决要美英侵略军队立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去，要美军从南朝鲜滚出去。
    崔东洙在朝鲜战争时期曾经在朝鲜人民军某部担任侦察分队长。他说，美帝国主义是一个外强中干的纸老虎，在朝鲜战争中就充分证明了这一点。他说，在朝鲜战争中，他们曾经同美军王牌海军陆战队第一师交过手，他和他的五个战友一次就消灭了它的一个排，并且活捉了三个美国强盗。他说，尽管美军有新式武器，但是它毫不可怕，只要人民团结起来就可以把它打败。他表示相信，争取民族解放的阿拉伯人民在全世界爱好和平人民的支援下，一定能取得胜利。
    崔东洙说，他们将以实际行动，在和平建设的岗位上努力增加生产，来促进朝鲜的和平统一，支持阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争。
    同一个工厂的果点车间工长、复员军人金德浚谴责了美英帝国主义武装侵略中近东、威胁世界和平的行为。
    这位在朝鲜战争中曾经参加过洛东江、“伤心岭”等著名战役的老军人说，在洛东江战役中，他们一支部队就杀伤了美军一万三千多人，击毁和缴获了二十多辆坦克和四十多门大炮。他说，张牙舞爪的帝国主义者毫不可怕，朝鲜人民在社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平人民的支援下打败美帝国主义的事实就是证明。
