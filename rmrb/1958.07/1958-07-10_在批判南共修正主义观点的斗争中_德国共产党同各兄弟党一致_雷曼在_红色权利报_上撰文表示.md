Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 9th. In an article, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, Lehmann, pointed out that the current situation is that the people of all countries are intensifying their efforts to safeguard peace, and the influence of peaceful forces on deciding international issues is growing.

    The article, entitled "Strive for the Unity of All Peaceful Forces, Oppose West German Imperialists' Establishment of Atomic Armaments," was published in the Czechoslovakian "Rude Pravo" on the 8th. The article stated that in Europe, the place where two concepts of world politics are in conflict is Germany. Here, the German Democratic Republic, as part of the socialist camp, opposes the establishment of atomic armaments and advocates the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, while the Federal Republic of Germany is increasingly becoming a hotbed of aggression and the greatest threat to the security of European countries.

    The article pointed out that at present, German imperialism is confronting the member states of the Warsaw Treaty on its eastern border. In order to achieve its revanchist goals through military aggression, it is beginning to expand westward, starting with the economic enslavement of Western European countries.

    The West German imperialists' economic enslavement of Western European countries is intended to use the entire economic power, military potential, and people of Western Europe to prepare for their aggression plans, which largely coincide with the plans of the American imperialists. German imperialism has been able to recover and develop only because of its collusion with American imperialism.

    The article then pointed out that West Germany will use 52 billion West German marks in the next three years to transform the West German army into the "best-equipped military force" on the European continent. In addition, according to the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, West Germany will use 100 billion West German marks to establish atomic armaments.

    Lehmann pointed out in the article that the rise of West German imperialism in the current situation is an attempt to annex the German Democratic Republic by force and make territorial demands on Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other European countries. The West German imperialists are the most notorious troublemakers of all plans to ease tensions in Europe. It is encouraged by American imperialism, which gives it concrete assistance to establish atomic armaments and to play the role of the reactionary watchdog in Europe.

    In response to this situation, the trend of opposing the establishment of atomic armaments and the creation of war, demanding the elimination of the threat of atomic war and the easing of international tensions, is growing. Standing at the forefront of the combat action against the establishment of atomic armaments is the working class.

    Lehmann wrote at the end of the article, "We support the unity of the socialist camp and all communist and workers' parties on the basis of proletarian internationalism. We, the German communists and all fraternal parties who criticize the revisionist views in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, are united because these views are not in accordance with Marxism-Leninism and are not in accordance with the theory and practice of communist and workers' parties. If the Yugoslav program plays the role of concealing the aggressive nature of American and West German imperialism, then this erroneous policy cannot but weaken the struggle of the working class and the masses of people for peace, and it also harms the interests of the Yugoslav people as much as it harms the interests of the people of other European countries. We believe that launching a struggle against modern revisionism is our responsibility because it objectively serves imperialism and weakens the international working-class movement."

    在批判南共修正主义观点的斗争中
    德国共产党同各兄弟党一致
    雷曼在“红色权利报”上撰文表示
    新华社布拉格9日电  德国共产党中央第一书记雷曼在一篇文章中指出，目前的形势是：各国人民正在加紧努力保障和平，和平力量对于决定国际问题所起的影响越来越大。
    这篇题为：“争取一切和平力量的团结、反对西德帝国主义者建立原子军备”的文章发表在8日捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”上。文章说，在欧洲，两种世界政策概念互相冲突的地方就是德国。在这里，德意志民主共和国作为社会主义阵营的一部分反对建立原子军备和赞成在中欧建立一个无原子武器区，而德意志联邦共和国却越来越成为侵略的温床，成为对欧洲各国安全的最大威胁。
    文章指出，目前，德国帝国主义正在它的东部边境上同华沙条约成员国对峙着。为了能够通过军事侵略达到它的复仇主义的目标，它正在开始向西方扩张，首先从经济上奴役西欧国家着手。
    西德帝国主义在经济上奴役西欧国家就是要利用整个西欧经济力量、军备潜力和人民来为他们的侵略计划进行准备，而这些计划在很大程度上是同美帝国主义者的计划相吻合的。德国帝国主义之所以能够恢复和发展只是由于它同美帝国主义勾结。
    文章接着指出，西德在今后三年中将要用五百二十亿西德马克来把西德军队变为欧洲大陆上“装备最好的军事力量”。另外，根据北大西洋公约组织的计划，西德将用一千亿西德马克来建立原子军备。
    雷曼在文章中指出，西德帝国主义在目前局势下的兴起是力图以武力并吞德意志民主共和国，并且向波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和其他欧洲国家提出领土要求。西德帝国主义者是缓和欧洲紧张局势的一切计划的声名最臭的骚乱者，它是受到美帝国主义的鼓励的，美帝国主义给予它具体帮助来建立原子军备和发挥反动派在欧洲的看门狗的作用。
    针对着这种形势，反对建立原子军备和制造战争的政策，要求消除原子战争的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的潮流正在增长着。站在反对建立原子军备的战斗行动的最前列的是工人阶级。
    雷曼在文章结束时写道，我们拥护社会主义阵营和一切共产党与工人党在无产阶级国际主义的基础上团结一致。我们德国共产党人和一切批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领里的修正主义观点的兄弟党是一致的，因为这些观点是同马克思列宁主义不相符合的，是同共产党和工人党的理论和实践不相符合的。如果说南共纲领起了掩饰美国和西德帝国主义侵略性质的作用的话，那么这个错误的方针就不能不削弱工人阶级和人民群众争取和平的斗争，而且也像损害欧洲其他国家人民的利益一样损害了南斯拉夫人民的利益。我们认为向现代修正主义展开斗争是我们的责任，因为它在客观上替帝国主义服务并且削弱国际工人阶级运动。
