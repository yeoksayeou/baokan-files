    A Deliverable Letter Was Returned
    The specifications of blueprint paper produced by the Beijing Blueprint Paper Factory are different from those of tracing paper produced by the Shanghai Paper Mill, resulting in waste when used together. Therefore, we wrote to both paper mills, suggesting that they jointly study whether the specifications of the two types of paper could be standardized according to the standards set by the First Ministry of Machine Building. Because we didn't know the detailed addresses of these two factories in Beijing and Shanghai, we could only address the letters to Beijing and Shanghai. We thought that these two factories were relatively large and well-known locally, so the post office would find a way to deliver them even without specifying the detailed address. However, a few days after the letters were sent, the letter to the Beijing Blueprint Paper Factory was returned by the Beijing Post Office (the one to Shanghai was not returned), because we didn't specify the street, alley, and house number of the recipient. I believe that the post office is perfectly justified in returning letters that do not specify the detailed address of the recipient, if the recipient is an individual or an unknown unit. However, for letters addressed to relatively large or locally well-known units, the post office could have delivered them but didn't, insisting on returning them according to postal regulations. This is not a proactive work attitude.
  (Editor's note: Just look up the Beijing Telephone Directory, and you can find the telephone number and address of the Beijing Blueprint Paper Factory.)

    有法送到的信退回来了
    北京市晒图纸厂出品的晒图纸规格与上海造纸厂出产的描图纸规格不一样，合用起来形成浪费。因此，我们分别给这两个纸厂去信，建议他们共同研究一下，可否按照第一机械工业部规定的标准，把两种纸的规格统一。因为不知道这两个厂在北京和上海的详细地址，受件人的地址只好寄北京和上海。我们想这两个厂规模比较大，在当地很著名，不写明详细地址邮局也会设法送到。但信寄走了几天后，给北京市晒图纸厂的信被北京市邮局退回来了（上海的没退回），原因是我们没写明受件人在那条街、胡同和门牌号数。我认为不写明受件人的详细地址的信件，如果是个人的或是不出名单位的，邮局完全应该退回。但是对规模比较大或当地著名的单位的信件，邮局本来可能送到而不送到，硬要按邮章规定退回，这也不是积极的工作态度。
  （编者注：只要翻开北京市电话号簿一查就查出北京市晒图纸厂的电话号码和地址）
