    Competing to Have the Township Head as Director
    During the Great Leap Forward in production in Lisheng Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, two agricultural cooperatives were vying to have the township head, Qu Xueshi, transferred to their cooperative. People from Red Star No. 1 Cooperative repeatedly requested that Qu Xueshi be transferred back to their cooperative to serve as the cooperative director (Qu's home was in No. 1 Cooperative), saying, "With Lao Qu leading us, we will have a greater chance of achieving our leap forward plan." People from Red Star No. 3 Cooperative absolutely refused to let Township Head Qu leave No. 3 Cooperative, saying, "Lao Qu leads us, everyone is very happy, how can we bear to let him go?"
    However, Qu Xueshi had been very unpopular with the masses for some time in the past. At that time, his work style was very simplistic and often involved coercion and commandism. For example, when promoting the method of cultivating cotton seedlings in nutrient pots in 1957, the masses had no experience and were not very enthusiastic, but Qu Xueshi rigidly pushed it forward. Xu Youchen was unwilling to make nutrient pots because he did not understand the technology. Qu Xueshi questioned him: "Are you dissatisfied with collectivization and technical reform? I'm telling you: you must do it, whether you understand it or not, and you have ten days to complete the task." As a result, when Qu Xueshi went to various cooperatives to inspect the nutrient pots, the masses would make them when he came, and stop when he left. A lot of seeds, fertilizers, and labor were wasted, and it was not promoted. He himself was very distressed. He believed that he had been well-intentioned in carrying out the task, but why could he understand it, and the masses could not? Therefore, he complained that the masses were backward. The masses, however, ridiculed him behind his back, saying, "Township Head Qu is juggling a stone mortar while playing with a lion, exhausting himself for nothing." Later, although he learned through study that coercion and commandism would alienate him from the masses, he did not have a new approach to actually doing things. Since the rectification campaign, he learned from others the method of holding on-site meetings. When the cotton was being eaten by insects, he took the cooperative cadres to the cotton fields to see the situation firsthand and mobilized everyone to calculate the detailed accounts. As a result, the cooperative cadres gained a deep understanding of insect control, and the insect control work was quickly carried out. Later, when he went to Red Star No. 3 Cooperative to inspect the digging of ponds and the accumulation of pond mud for fertilizer, he saw that the members were afraid of the cold and unwilling to go down and carry it, so he was the first to go down and work. Soon, more than forty people followed. He worked with the members for four days, and the masses became more affectionate towards him, saying that Township Head Qu had changed. Later, under the influence of County Party Secretary Zhao Jintang, he planted experimental plots and consulted with the cooperative cadres in the fields while trying things out. Everyone was very satisfied.
    Qu Xueshi said: "Now I have finally figured out the right way to do things. I like the masses, and the masses like me."

    争要乡长当主任
    湖北省麻城县李胜乡在搞生产大跃进时，两个农业社都争着要求把乡长屈学诗调到自己社去。红星一社的人一再要求把屈学诗调回自己社当社主任（屈的家在一社），说“有老屈领导，我们实现跃进计划的把握更大。”红星三社的人无论如何不同意屈乡长离开三社，说是“老屈领导我们，大家都很欢喜，我们怎舍得叫他走”。
    但是，屈学诗在过去一段时间里，曾经是很不受群众欢迎的，那时，他的作风很简单，常常强迫命令。例如1957年推广营养钵育棉苗的办法时，群众没经验，劲头不大，但屈学诗却生硬推行。徐幼臣因不懂技术，不愿做营养钵，屈学诗便质问他：你这是对合作化不满，对技术改革不满，跟你说：你通也得通，不通也得通，限十天完成任务。”结果，屈学诗到各社检查营养钵时，群众见他来了就做，他走了就停。浪费了很多种籽、肥料和人工，也没推广起来。他自己很苦闷。认为自己执行任务是一片好心，为什么我能想得通，而群众就想不通？因此他抱怨群众落后。而群众却背后讽刺他“屈乡长是顶着碓臼玩狮子，累死不好看。”以后，虽然经过了学习，他知道了强迫命令会脱离群众，但究竟怎样办？他没有新办法。整风以来，他学了别人开现场会议的办法，在棉花被虫咬时，他带着社干部到棉地去实地看，发动大家算细账，结果社干部们才对除虫有了深刻认识，除虫工作很快便开展起来。后来，他到红星三社检查挖水塘，积塘泥作肥料时，见社员们怕冷、不愿下去挑，他就第一个下去干，接着，很快下去四十多人。他同社员一起干了四天，群众对他亲热起来，说是屈乡长变了。后来，他在县委书记赵金堂的影响下，种了试验田，有事就找社干部们到田里一面商量，一面试着干，大家很满意。
    屈学诗说：“如今我算摸到门路了，我喜欢群众，群众也喜欢我。”
