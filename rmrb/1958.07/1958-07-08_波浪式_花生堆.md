    "Wave-like" Peanut Mound
    Farmers in Longtan Township, Ziyang County, Sichuan Province, are experimenting with a "wave-like" peanut mound cultivation method, which can make one mu of land function as more than one and a half mu.
    This method is simple and easy to implement. Simply dig up the soil in the peanut field and fill it to form a series of truncated cone-shaped mounds, six chi square and three chi high. Then, plant peanuts layer by layer on the sloping surface of the mounds.
    The benefits of this cultivation method are: First, it can improve land utilization. It is estimated that one mu of land can accommodate 190 mounds. Each mound can be planted with 70 to 80 seedlings, totaling 12,000 to 15,000 seedlings, which is 4,000 to 7,000 more seedlings than in ordinary peanut fields, and the yield can also be increased by half to one time. Second, it achieves deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, which can improve the yield per unit area. Because it is necessary to dig 1.5 chi deep into the same piece of land to fill the three chi high peanut mound, this digs out the fertile soil that was previously difficult to deeply plow, which not only loosens the soil, but also increases the fertility of the peanut mound, allowing the peanut roots to penetrate deeper and the peanut pegs to easily insert into the soil. Third, it can conserve water and fertilizer: small ditches are left between the mounds in the field, which is convenient for drainage and water storage. The mounds are small at the top and large at the bottom. As long as water and manure fertilizer are regularly and appropriately applied from the top, the crops around the mound can receive water and fertilizer. (Attached picture)

    “波浪式”花生堆
    四川资阳县龙潭乡农民试种一种“波浪式”花生堆，可以使一亩地当一亩半以上使用。
    这种方法简便易行，只要在花生地里挖土填成一个接一个的见方六尺、高三尺的锥形土堆，再在土堆的斜面坡级上一层层地种上花生。
    这种栽培方法的好处是：一、能提高土地利用率，计一亩地可作一百九十个堆，一堆可种七、八十窝，共种一万二至一万五千窝，比一般花生地多种四至七千窝，产量也能提高半倍至一倍。二、作到深耕细作，能提高单位面积产量；因为要在同一块地里挖下一尺五寸深的土才能填成三尺高的花生堆，这就把以往不易深耕到的熟土挖了出来，不仅起到松土作用，并且增加了花生堆的肥力，使花生根子扎得深，花生针容易插入土内。三、能保水保肥：地里堆与堆之间都留有小沟，便于排水、蓄水，堆是上小下大，只要经常适当地从顶上浇水和施粪水肥，就能使堆四周的庄稼都能接受水份和肥料。（附图片）
