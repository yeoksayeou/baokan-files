Inner Mongolia University Prospers in its National Culture

	In the fields of the southern suburbs of Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, stands a newly established higher education institution from last autumn. This is the first comprehensive university in China's minority ethnic regions – Inner Mongolia University.

	Inner Mongolia University, marking a new stage in the development of Inner Mongolia's ethnic culture and science, is not only responsible for cultivating construction talents loyal to socialism and combining manual and mental labor for the country, but also for prospering and developing Inner Mongolia's ethnic culture, training intellectuals of its own ethnicity, and carrying out scientific research work in the autonomous region. To achieve this dual mission, Inner Mongolia University resolutely implemented the class line of opening its doors to the children of workers, peasants, and herdsmen, and vigorously cultivated ethnic teachers and expanded the proportion of ethnic students. Currently, the university has 162 teachers of various ethnicities and 338 students (including 93 Mongolian and other minority students). The proportion of students from worker-peasant backgrounds is over 54%. After this summer's recruitment of new students, Mongolian students will account for about one-third of all students. The university currently has seven departments, including Mongolian Language and Literature, Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, with eight specialties.

	The rapidly growing Inner Mongolia University, in less than a year since its establishment, has, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the central government and many brother universities across the country, especially Peking University, now has 38,000 square meters of school buildings, including the main building and specialized buildings, more than 230,000 books, and various instruments sufficient for first and second-year university experiments. At present, the university is initially well-equipped in terms of school buildings, teaching facilities, and library resources. The Party and the state have also transferred a large number of outstanding teachers from domestic universities to teach here. The well-known botanist and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Li Ji侗, has come to the school to serve as vice president. To strengthen political and ideological work in the school, Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, personally serves as the president.

	This Inner Mongolia University, born in the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, has a lively socialist political atmosphere from the very beginning. Currently, inspired by the General Line, all teachers and students are vigorously carrying out teaching reforms and formulating personal red and expert plans based on the needs of production and construction. In addition to the fact that one-third of the teachers have already gone to the countryside for labor training, some teachers and students will soon go deep into pastoral areas to conduct research. The trend of students participating in work-study programs has already taken shape. In addition to their intensive studies, they are also cultivating more than 60 mu of garden plots and engaging in extensive voluntary labor. All indications show that Inner Mongolia University is moving towards a new type of socialist university. (Qin Jilun) (Attached picture)

    繁荣本民族文化的内蒙古大学
    在内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市新城南郊的田野上，有一所去年秋天刚刚诞生的高等学校。这就是我国少数民族地区中的第一所综合性大学——内蒙古大学。
    标志着内蒙古民族文化和科学发展新阶段的内蒙古大学，不仅要为国家培养出忠实于社会主义、体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的建设人材；还要担负着繁荣、发展内蒙古的民族文化、培养本民族的知识分子，和开展自治区科学研究工作的任务。为实现这个双重任务，内蒙古大学坚决执行了向工农牧民子弟开门的阶级路线，并大力培养民族师资和扩大民族学生的比重。现在这个大学有各民族的教师一百六十二人，学生三百三十八人（其中蒙古族和其他少数民族学生九十三人）。学生的工农成分占54％以上。今年暑期招考新生后，蒙古族学生将占各族学生的三分之一左右。全校目前设有蒙古语言文学、汉语言文学、历史、数学、物理、化学和生物等七个系，八个专业。
    迅速成长中的内蒙古大学，在成立不到一年的时间内，由于中央和全国许多兄弟院校、特别是北京大学的热情支援，现在已有了包括主楼、专业楼在内的三万八千平方公尺的校舍，二十三万多册图书和足够大学一、二年级实验用的各种仪器。目前，这所大学在学校建筑、教学设备和图书资料等方面。已初具规模。党和国家并从国内大学中，调来了大批优秀教师前来任教，著名的植物学家、科学院学部委员李继侗已来校担任副校长职务。为加强学校中的政治思想工作，内蒙古党委第一书记、内蒙古自治区主席乌兰夫亲任校长。
    这所诞生在整风和反右派斗争中的内蒙古大学，一开始就有着生动活泼的社会主义政治气氛，目前，全校师生在总路线的鼓舞下，正根据生产建设需要，大力进行教学改革和制订个人的红专规划。全校教师除已有三分之一下放农村劳动锻炼外，一部分师生即将深入牧区进行调查研究工作。学生中的勤工俭学之风已经形成，他们在紧张的学习外，还培育着六十多亩园田和从事广泛的义务劳动。一切迹象都在表明：内蒙古大学正在向着社会主义的新型大学迈进。（秦继仑）（附图片）
