    Work is Easier, Thinking is More Open
    Everyone in Lintao County Reads the Newspaper
    According to a report in the Gansu Daily: A study atmosphere of every household subscribing to newspapers and everyone reading newspapers has basically formed in Lintao County, Gansu Province. According to statistics from the Lintao County Post and Telecommunications Bureau at the end of June, the county has more than 43,400 households and more than 272,800 people. In July, subscriptions to the People's Daily, China Youth Daily, Gansu Daily, and Gansu Peasant Daily totaled 53,229 copies, averaging less than one copy per household or one copy for every five people. Subscriptions to various magazines totaled 13,075 copies, averaging one copy for every 20 people.
    Lintao County attaches great importance to newspaper retail work. The county did not have retail sales of newspapers before. Starting in June this year, in addition to the fixed retail sale of 30 copies of the Gansu Daily every day, it also expanded the retail sale of newspapers carrying important documents and important local news and articles. In May alone, more than 100,000 copies of newspapers carrying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and reports on the Dingxi Special District Technological Revolution Promotion Conference were sold, powerfully cooperating with the publicity of the General Line.
    With the overall great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the victory of the rectification movement, the broad masses of cadres and people are eager to study politics, culture, current affairs, and experiences from other places, continuously improve their political consciousness, and better implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Therefore, they are eager to subscribe to newspapers and magazines. In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Lintao County Party Committee and the County Post and Telecommunications Bureau formulated plans for newspaper and magazine distribution in February of this year. Subsequently, cadres at all levels throughout the county publicized and collected subscriptions. The postal and telecommunications departments also improved their work, implementing door-to-door subscriptions, which greatly facilitated readers.

    工作好做了　思想开朗了
    临洮县人人读报
    据甘肃日报消息　甘肃省临洮县家家订报，人人看报的学习风气已经基本形成。据临洮县邮电局6月底的统计，这个县有四万三千四百多户，二十七万二千八百多人，7月份订阅人民日报、中国青年报、甘肃日报和甘肃农民报共达五万三千二百二十九份，平均不到一户或每五个人就有一份报。订阅各种杂志一万三千零七十五份，平均二十人一份。
    临洮县非常重视报刊零售工作。这个县以前没有零售报，从今年6月开始，除每天固定零售甘肃日报三十份外，还扩大零售刊载有重要文件和当地重要消息、文章的报纸。仅5月份就零售刊载有中共八大二次会议文件和定西专区技术革命促进大会报道的报纸十万余份，有力地配合了总路线的宣传。
    随着工农业生产的全面大跃进和整风运动的胜利，广大干部和群众迫切要求学习政治、文化、时事和外地经验，不断提高自己的政治觉悟和很好地贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线，因此迫切要求订阅报纸和杂志。为了满足群众这种要求，中共临洮县委和县邮电局在今年2月先后制定了报刊发行工作规划。接着，全县各级干部人人宣传，人人收订。邮电部门也改进工作，实行上门收订，大大地方便了读者。
