    Today's Duyun
    By Our Correspondent
    As the sun sets, a train speeding along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, draped in the brilliant evening glow, cuts through the mountains and ridges of the Miao Mountain range, pulling into its current terminal—Duyun City, the capital of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Groups of travelers disembark the train, led into spacious and comfortable hostels. Among them are hundreds of cadres dispatched from the capital to support the construction of Guizhou. At the train station, stevedores are busy unloading a large number of new red trucks and machinery from the train, then loading up the train with Guizhou's abundant grain, cattle, minerals, flue-cured tobacco, and other local specialties. On the streets, propaganda teams from various government agencies, organizations, and schools are out in force, with gongs and drums filling the air, promoting the Party's General Line for socialist construction. In front of the Cultural Center, a colorful archway has been erected. The 210 representatives of various ethnic groups attending the first session of the First People's Congress of Duyun City emerge from the venue in twos and threes, carrying the excitement of discussing how to build Duyun into an industrial city.

    Duyun, a city embraced by verdant mountains and nestled along the Jian River in the Guizhou Plateau, is becoming increasingly beautiful and attractive with the rapid political, economic, and cultural development of the Buyi and Miao people of Qiannan. Before liberation, it had only over 10,000 people, two dilapidated streets lined with low houses, and an urban area of just 1.2 square kilometers. There were no factories or cultural and recreational facilities. Since liberation in 1949, especially during the First Five-Year Plan, it has been changing at a rapid pace. Today, the population has increased to over 60,000, and the urban area has expanded tenfold. On the barren fields of the past, sports grounds, theaters, and people's hospitals have been built. A wide street has grown along the banks of the Jian River, lined with rows of three- and four-story buildings housing cinemas, clubs, hostels, department stores, shoe stores, and more, forming a new, prosperous street. Particularly noteworthy are the tall construction frames erected on both sides of the Jian River in the suburbs, poised to build one modern factory after another, transforming Duyun rapidly into a modern industrial city. According to the leading departments' plans, the factories to be built this year include an iron and steel plant with an annual output of 90,000 tons of iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and 40,000 tons of steel products, a 6,000-kilowatt power plant, as well as a flax mill, a frozen meat factory, a potassium permanganate factory, a cement factory, and a machine-made paper mill, totaling more than ten factories. The flax mill and frozen meat factory have already officially commenced construction. These factories, which have already begun construction or are about to be built, will combine with the small factories such as agricultural implements, leather, and paper making, built in the first few years after liberation, to form a large factory district.

    With rapid economic development, cultural and educational undertakings are also developing rapidly. There are now seven secondary schools and ethnic language schools, with nearly 3,000 students. Primary education has been basically universalized, with primary schools increasing to fourteen, and over 5,700 students. In addition, Party and government leading departments are now actively preparing to establish teachers' colleges and agricultural colleges. Two cinemas, each capable of accommodating a thousand spectators, have been built successively. The ethnic song and dance troupe and Peking opera troupe, established not long ago, each has more than forty young actors. Through continuous efforts to improve their performance levels, they have begun to attract people's attention. At the same time, the health service has also developed rapidly. The newly built Prefectural People's Hospital has more than one hundred medical staff, with various modern medical equipment, capable of treating not only general diseases but also relatively complex diseases. In addition, there are many joint clinics, maternal and child health stations, and other health institutions. Before liberation, cultural education and health services were very backward. At that time, there were only three secondary schools with only six hundred students; a dilapidated Duyun County Hospital had only thirteen staff members.

    In the near future, it is hard for outsiders to imagine how beautiful Duyun will develop into. According to information from leading departments, in the next three years, the population here will grow to more than 100,000, and the urban area will extend more than ten kilometers north and south along the Jian River. The future new urban area will be composed of numerous factories and railway junctions. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings will also have leapfrog development. (Attached photos)

专栏：民族自治地方城市风光

    今日都匀
    本报记者
    夕阳西下，一列急驰在黔桂铁路上的火车，披着艳丽的晚霞，穿过苗岭山脉的丛山峻岭，驶入了它目前的终点站——黔南布依族苗族自治州首府都匀市。成群结队的旅客走下火车，被引进宽敞而舒适的旅社里，这其中有数以百计的干部，是从首都前来支援贵州建设的。火车站上，搬运工人忙碌地把大批的红色新型大卡车和机器从车上卸下来，然后把贵州的大批粮食、耕牛、矿产和烤烟等土特产品装上火车。街头，各机关、团体和学校的宣传队一齐出动，锣鼓喧天，宣传党的社会主义建设总路线。在文化馆门前竖起了一座五彩缤纷的彩门，出席都匀市第一届人民代表大会第一次会议的二百一十位各族代表，带着在会上讨论把都匀建成一个工业城市的兴奋神情，三三两两地走出会场。
    都匀，这座翠山环抱，偎依剑水的贵州高原城市，随着黔南布依族苗族人民政治、经济、文化的迅速发展，越来越变得美丽诱人。解放前，这里只有一万多人，两条矮小房屋组成的破烂街道，市区不过一点二平方公里，既没有工厂，也没有什么文化娱乐场所。1949年解放以来，特别是在第一个五年计划期间，它却以飞快的速度变化着，至今人口增加到六万多，市区扩大了十倍；昔日的荒野上建成了运动场、剧院和人民医院；一条宽敞的大街沿着剑水河滨成长起来，电影院、俱乐部、旅社、百货公司、鞋帽公司等等三四层的高楼，成排成行的矗立着，组成了新型的繁荣街道。而特别引人注意的，是郊区剑水河两岸树起的高大的建筑架，要兴建一个连一个的现代化工厂，使都匀迅速变成一个现代工业城市。据领导部门计划，今年要兴建的工厂有年产九万吨铁、五万吨钢、四万吨钢材的钢铁厂，六千瓩的发电厂，以及麻纺厂、冻肉厂、高锰酸钾厂、水泥厂和机制纸厂等十多个工厂。目前已正式动工兴建的有麻纺厂和冻肉厂。这些已经开始兴建和即将兴建的工厂，将和解放后头几年建设的农具、制革、造纸等小型工厂联成一片，形成庞大的工厂区。
    随着经济的迅速发展，文化教育事业也在迅速地发展。现已有中等学校和民族语文学校七所，学生近三千名。小学教育已基本上实现普及，小学校发展到十四所，学生五千七百多人。此外，党政领导部门现正积极筹办师范专科学校和农业专科学校。能容纳一千个观众的电影院，已先后建成两座。不久前成立的民族歌舞队和京剧团，各有四十多名年青的演员，他们由于不断努力提高演剧水平，已开始引起人们的注意。同时，卫生事业也有了迅速发展。新建的州人民医院，医务人员达一百多人，有各种新式医疗设备，不仅能治疗一般的疾病，并且能治疗比较复杂的疾病。此外，还有不少联合诊所、妇幼保健站等卫生机构。而在解放前，文化教育和卫生事业都很落后。那时，中等学校只有三所，学生只有六百人；一个残破的都匀县医院只有十三名工作人员。
    在不久的将来，都匀将要发展成怎样美好的城市，这是局外人很难想像的。据从领导部门了解，在今后的三年内，这里人口将要发展到十多万人，市区的范围将要沿着剑水河滨向南北各伸延十多公里。将来的新市区，将要由林立的工厂和铁路枢纽站来组成。文教卫生事业，也要有飞跃的发展。（附图片）
