Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 6th. The Guangdong Provincial Financial Work Qujiang On-site Meeting to promote the experience of township-level financial work concluded on the 5th. This meeting marks that the great leap forward in financial work has entered a new stage, requiring all regions to quickly establish township-level finance to meet the needs of the new situation.

The best financial work in Qujiang County is done in Zhangshi Township and Maba Township. Representatives attending the meeting visited the sites of these two townships successively. And learned from the advanced experience of these two townships in establishing township-level finance.

The main experience of Zhangshi Township is: not simply circling around financial business, but actively developing production, organizing income, and solving the needs of rural production and construction. This township is located in a mountainous area with a population of more than 15,000, and production has greatly developed in recent years. At present, Zhangshi Township has formulated a three-year socialist construction plan, the goal of which is to achieve seven "10,000s" (10,000-head pig farm, 10,000-chicken farm, 10,000-mu orchard, 10,000-head cattle farm, 10,000-person new village, 10,000-mu fish pond, 10,000-hive bee farm), and fifteen "izations" (high yield of oil and grain, reservoir fish ponds, rural electrification, agricultural mechanization, traffic highways, agricultural collective farms, hydraulic automation, irrigation and water conservancy, tool innovation, new rural housing, literacy of the illiterate, hygiene for every household, village landscaping, orchard development on barren hills, and beautification of streets). Achieving this plan requires a lot of funds. The main way for Zhangshi Township to organize financial income is: the township draws a part of the labor force from the agricultural cooperatives, plus the handicraft industries in the market towns, the wooden sailboat transportation cooperative, and a small part of the commerce, and unifies them into a township-run joint cooperative, that is, a township-run joint comprehensive enterprise, to develop mountainous areas and engage in a variety of production. The joint cooperative is strengthened under the leadership of the township party committee and the township people's committee, and the income and expenditure are completely arranged by the township. Zhangshi Township's joint cooperative has organized 1,538 people to carry out various productions. This year, it plans to obtain 2.35 million yuan in income from timber, charcoal, bricks, tiles, lime, transportation, iron and wood processing, animal husbandry, and service industries. After paying wages and management fees, the net income will reach 1.69 million yuan. Among them, 700,000 yuan will be used to build chicken farms, pig farms, cattle farms, etc., 500,000 yuan will be used to build hydropower stations, 150,000 yuan will be used to open roads and purchase cars and electric boats, 100,000 yuan will be used to establish tractor stations, 20,000 yuan will be used to build hospitals and run middle schools, etc., and 20,000 yuan will be used to rebuild all market town streets. In addition, some remaining funds are yet to be specifically arranged.

Participating in this meeting were representatives from the financial departments of seven provinces and regions, including Xinjiang, Gansu, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Guangxi, as well as various special zones and counties in Guangdong Province. Vice Minister of Finance Wu Bo and Vice Governor of Guangdong Province Wei Jinfei attended the meeting.

Wu Bo said that if the experience of Qujiang County in establishing township-level finance is promoted throughout the country, it can increase the country's construction funds by 16 billion to 20 billion yuan each year.

Vice Governor of Guangdong Province Wei Jinfei said that the establishment of township finance will enable the grassroots party committees and township people's committees to exert greater enthusiasm, thereby mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, especially the peasant masses, enabling millions of townships to play a cellular role on the financial front, and fully leveraging the power of the whole party and the whole people to run finance, thereby cultivating financial resources for the development of production. He said that the establishment of township finance can solve the needs of rural production and construction funds.

After discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that according to the principle of combining industry and agriculture and running industries and undertakings in every township, it is impossible for the township to have no financial power. It is necessary to establish township finance to meet the needs of the new situation. The representatives expressed one after another that they would "learn from Qujiang, compete with Qujiang, and surpass Qujiang."

    更好地调动广大农民的积极性和创造性
    建立乡一级财政发展生产
    曲江现场会议推广乡办财政的经验
    据新华社广州6日电　推广乡一级财政工作经验的广东省财政工作曲江现场会议5日闭幕。这个会标志着财政工作大跃进已经进入一个新的阶段，要求各地迅速建立乡一级财政，以适应新形势的需要。
    曲江县财政工作做得最好的是樟市乡和马坝乡。参加会议的代表先后参观了这两个乡的现场。并学习了这两个乡建立乡一级财政的先进经验。
    樟市乡的主要经验是：不单纯在财政业务上打圈子，而是积极发展生产，组织收入，解决乡村生产建设的需要，这个乡地处山区，有一万五千多人口，几年来生产有很大发展。目前，樟市乡已经制定了三年的社会主义建设规划，目标是实现七万（万头猪场、万只鸡场、万亩果园、万头牛场、万人新村、万亩鱼塘、万箱蜂场）、十五化（油粮高产化、水库鱼塘化、农村电气化、农业机械化、交通公路化、农庄集体化、水力自动化、排灌水利化、工具革新化、农村新屋化、文盲知识化、户户卫生化、村庄花园化、荒山果园化、街道美观化）。实现这一规划需要很多资金。樟市乡组织财政收入的主要方式是：由乡抽调农业社一部分劳动力，加上墟镇中手工业各行业、木帆船运输社和少部分商业，统一组成为乡的联社，即乡办的联合综合企业，开发山区，从事多种多样生产。联社由乡党委和乡人民委员会派干部加强领导，收支完全由乡安排。樟市乡的联社已组织一千五百三十八人进行各种生产，今年计划从木材、木炭、砖瓦、石灰、运输、铁木器加工、牧畜业、服务业等方面的生产取得二百三十五万元收入，除支付工资和管理费用外，纯收入将达一百六十九万元。其中七十万元将用于办鸡场、猪场、牛场等，五十万元将用来建设水电站，十五万元用于开公路，购买汽车、电船，十万元用来建立拖拉机站，二万元用来兴建医院、办中学等，二万元用来改建全部墟镇街道。除此以外，剩下一部分资金尚待具体安排。
    参加这次会议的有新疆、甘肃、湖北、湖南、河南、广西等七个省区和广东省各专区、县财政部门的代表。财政部副部长吴波、广东省副省长魏今非出席了这次会议。
    吴波说，曲江县建立乡一级财政的经验，如果在全国推广，每年就能为国家增加一百六十——二百亿元的建设资金。
    广东省副省长魏今非说，建立乡财政就使基层党委和乡人民委员会发挥更高的积极性，从而调动广大群众特别是农民群众的积极性和创造性，使千百万个乡在财政战线上起细胞作用，充分发挥全党全民办财政的力量，从而为发展生产培养财源。他说，乡财政的建立可以解决农村生产建设资金的需要。
    各地代表经过讨论，一致认为根据工农业并举和乡乡办工业、乡乡办事业的方针，乡没有财权是不行的，必须建立乡财政才能适应新形势的需要。代表们纷纷表示要“学曲江、赛曲江、过曲江”。
