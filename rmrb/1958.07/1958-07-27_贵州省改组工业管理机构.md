    Guizhou Province Reorganizes Industrial Management Agencies

    (From Our Newspaper) Guizhou Province has reorganized its industrial management agencies, transforming the all-encompassing Industrial Department into eight bureaus and departments, to adapt to the rapid development of local industry and the new situation of the central government transferring a batch of factories and mines to local control.

    This province originally had only one Industrial Department. Under the new circumstances, this inevitably led to a situation of being "unable to reach the top, unable to reach the bottom, unable to grasp, and unable to manage." In light of this situation, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee recently studied and decided to reorganize the Industrial Department, the Handicraft Industry Administration Bureau, and the industrial enterprises transferred from the central government into six bureaus - Machinery, Chemical Industry, Light Industry, Metallurgy, Coal, and Geology - and two departments - Water Conservancy and Electric Power, and Urban Construction - to manage their respective specialties.

    贵州省改组工业管理机构
    本报讯　贵州省改组工业管理机构，把一揽子的工业厅改组成八个厅、局，以适应地方工业飞跃发展和中央一批厂矿下放的新局面。
    这个省原来只有一个工业厅，在新形势下，必然会形成“上不来，下不去，抓不了，管不好”的局面。根据这一情况，中共贵州省委和贵州省人民委员会最近研究决定，把工业厅、手工业管理局和中央下放的工业企业单位，改组成机械、化工、轻工、冶金、煤炭、地质六个局和水利电力、城市建设两个厅，专业分别管理。
