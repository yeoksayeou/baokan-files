Foolish, Dangerous, and Useless Interference
British "Observer" Says US-British Aggressors Are Moving in the Wrong Direction

    London dispatch: The British "Observer" admitted on the 20th that the US-British aggression in the Middle East was "an action taken in the wrong direction."
    It said: "Like the Suez Canal incident, this interference is foolish, dangerous and useless."
    The newspaper said that due to the cancellation of aid for the Aswan Dam, "this incident has caused the United States to lose friends in the Middle East and has brought misfortune to Britain in Amman." It suggested that the US and Britain restore "economic aid" to Arab countries in order to deceive and win them over. But it had to admit that: "It will be a long and laborious task for the United States and Britain to regain the trust of the Arab people."

    糊涂的、危险的和无用的干涉
    英国“观察家报”说美英侵略者走错了方向
    本报讯  伦敦消息：英国“观察家报”20日承认，美英侵略中东是“一个朝错误方向采取的行动。”
    它说：“像苏伊士运河事件一样，这种干涉是糊涂的、危险的和无用的。”
    这家报纸说，由于撤销对阿斯旺水坝的援助，“这种事件使美国在中东丧失了朋友，使英国在安曼倒了霉。”它建议美英恢复对阿拉伯国家的“经济援助”，以便进行欺骗和拉拢。但是它又不得不承认：美英两国“要重新赢得阿拉伯人民的信任是一件长期而费力的事情。”
