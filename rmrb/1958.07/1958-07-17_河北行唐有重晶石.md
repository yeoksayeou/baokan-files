    Barite Found in Xingtang, Hebei

    (From Our Newspaper) High-grade barite has been discovered on Baidapo Mountain, about 18 kilometers northwest of Xingtang County, Hebei Province. Sampling and verification have proven that the main component contains up to 98.02% barium sulfate, ranking first among the barite currently mined in the country. This mine has reserves of more than 500,000 tons.

    Barite is an indispensable material for the chemical industry, pharmaceutical industry, and paper industry, such as making blanc fixe, barium oxide, barium carbonate, barium sulfide, etc., all of which require barite. Barite can also be used as a copper smelting flux, drilling mud, etc.

    河北行唐有重晶石
    本报讯　河北省行唐县城西北约十八公里的白达坡山，发现了高级重晶石。经过开采取样化验证明，主要成分含硫酸钡高达98.02％，居现在全国开采的重晶石的第一位。这个矿蕴藏量有五十多万吨以上。
    重晶石是化学工业、制药工业、造纸工业不可缺少的材料，如制作钡白粉、氧化钡、碳酸钡、硫化钡等都需要重晶石。重晶石还可以作冶铜熔剂、钻探泥浆等。
