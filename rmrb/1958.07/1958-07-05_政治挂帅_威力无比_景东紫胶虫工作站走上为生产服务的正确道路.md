    Politics in Command, Boundless Power
    Jingdong Lac Insect Station Embarks on the Correct Path of Serving Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Jingdong Lac Insect Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Yunnan Biological Exploration Team, since its establishment three years ago, has implemented two different research policies and obtained different results. In the past, this station conducted research behind closed doors, divorced from production, and the research work was stagnant. Since September of last year, under the leadership of the Jingdong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, it has embarked on the correct path of serving production, and a new situation of vigorous development has emerged in the research work.

    In May 1955, after the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Yunnan Biological Exploration Team investigated the resources and production of lac, an important industrial raw material, in the subtropical area of southwestern Yunnan Province, it decided to establish a workstation in Jingdong County, an important lac-producing area, as a long-term research base to provide a scientific basis and technical data for the development of lac production in Yunnan. The state successively transferred more than ten researchers from various relevant units to work at the station, and allocated more than 500,000 yuan for construction and research funds, purchasing many of the latest domestic and foreign instruments and equipment. However, most of the researchers at the station regarded the study of lac as a tool for personal fame, hoping to collect data specimens here, find topics to write papers, and take the assistant doctoral exam in the future. Some people also felt that the conditions here were too poor, there was no library with a rich collection of books, and no famous scientists to guide them regularly, and they were worried about whether they could obtain an associate doctorate. So they were depressed all day long and missed Beijing.

    In September of last year, after the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yunnan Biological Exploration Team inspected the work of the station, they criticized the station's long-term detachment from production and decided to hand over the station to the leadership of the Jingdong County Committee of the Communist Party of China. In response to the station's detachment from politics and loss of direction, the Jingdong County Committee first assigned more Party member cadres, established a Party branch, and strengthened political and ideological work.

    Through rectification and debate, the "policy that science must serve production" was established. The station accepted the commission of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Forestry to run a lac production training class. At the same time, it also assisted cadres from various counties in formulating plans for the development of lac production this year. Jingdong County, where the station is located, plans to produce 100,000 jin of lac this year, a fourteen-fold increase over last year's output. In order to realize this leap-forward plan, the station sent researchers to assist and guide the county in establishing a lac farm as a base for developing lac production and adopting new technologies. The station has also established regular contacts with nearby agricultural cooperatives to be responsible for solving technical problems in lac production. Now most of the researchers at the station are working with peace of mind, as one young researcher said: "I used to think that working here had no future, but now I know that there are thirty-four counties in Yunnan with a population of about one million producing lac, and isn't it a heroic cause for us to directly serve one million people in our lifetime?" What used to be done by several people is now shouldered by one person. Everyone also takes time to participate in physical labor, open experimental nurseries, and plant the main parasitic trees of lac insects, observing and studying which ones reproduce quickly, so as to promote them in production. Now, concern for production has replaced concern for personal fame and gain. At the end of May, the Jingdong County Lac Farm was unable to put all the lac insects on the trees in time due to insufficient labor. The entire station mobilized and launched a surprise attack for a day to help the lac farm put the lac insects on the trees. (Huang Changlu)

    政治挂帅　威力无比
    景东紫胶虫工作站走上为生产服务的正确道路
    本报讯　中国科学院云南生物考察队景东紫胶虫工作站成立三年来，先后执行了两种研究方针，获得了不同的结果。这个工作站过去长期闭门研究，脱离生产，研究工作死气沉沉；自去年9月由中共景东县委领导后，走上了为生产服务的正确道路，研究工作出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。
    1955年5月，中国科学院云南生物考察队，在云南省西南部亚热带地区调查重要工业原料紫胶的资源和生产情况以后，确定在重要产胶区景东县建立工作站，作为长期研究紫胶的基点，以便为云南发展紫胶生产提供科学依据和技术资料。国家陆续从各有关单位抽调了十多个研究人员到站工作，先后拨给了五十来万元的建设和研究经费，购买许多国内外最新的仪器设备。但是，工作站的多数研究人员却把研究紫胶当作个人成名的工具，想在这里搜集资料标本，找题目写论文，将来考副博士。有的人还认为这里条件太差，没有藏书丰富的图书馆，没有著名的科学家经常指导，副博士能否获得，感到忧虑。于是终日苦闷，思念北京。
    去年9月，中共云南省委和云南生物考察队检查该站工作后，对工作站长期脱离生产的道路进行了批评，并决定将工作站交给中共景东县委领导。景东县委针对工作站脱离政治、迷失方向的情况，首先加派了党员干部，建立了党的支部，加强政治思想工作。
    通过整风和辩论，确立了“科学必须为生产服务的方针”。工作站接受云南省农业厅和林业厅的委托，开办了紫胶生产训练班。同时还协助各县干部订出了今年发展紫胶生产的计划。工作站所在的景东县，今年计划生产紫胶十万斤，比去年产量增加十四倍。为了实现这个跃进计划，工作站派研究人员协助和指导县里创办了一个紫胶农场，作为发展紫胶生产和采用新技术的基地。工作站还同附近农业社建立了经常联系，负责解决紫胶生产中的技术问题。现在工作站的研究人员多数都安心工作，正如一个青年研究人员所说：“以前觉得在这里工作没有前途，现在知道云南有三十四个县大约一百万人口的地区产紫胶，我们这一辈子能为一百万人直接服务，这不是豪迈的事业吗？”过去几个人做的事情现在一个人就担负起来了。大家还抽时间参加体力劳动，开出试验苗圃，种植了紫胶虫的主要寄生树，实地观察研究哪种繁殖快，以便在生产中推广。现在是关心生产代替了计较个人名利。5月底，景东县紫胶农场因劳动力不足，不能及时将紫胶虫全部放上树，工作站全部出动，突击了一天，帮助紫胶农场把紫胶虫放到树上。（黄昌禄）
