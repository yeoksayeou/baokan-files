Tianjin Trading Departments Sign Contracts with Chengde Special District
Mutually Beneficial Cooperation to Develop the Steel Industry
Chengde Special District Manufactures Blowers to Build Small Blast Furnaces

(Reported by our Tianjin correspondent on the 14th) The Chengde Special District of Hebei Province recently signed two mutual aid contracts with the Tianjin branch of the China National Import and Export Corporation and the Tianjin Hardware Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company, respectively. The Hardware Station will be responsible for one hundred of the two hundred small blast furnaces planned to be built in the special district this year. Except for mining, which will be handled locally, the Hardware Station will be fully responsible for the equipment, funds, etc. needed to build the small blast furnaces. The Hardware Station will also provide funds for building materials, whether purchased by both parties or by one party. Once these one hundred small blast furnaces are completed, they can produce 150,000 tons of pig iron annually; from next year to 1962, the Chengde Special District will supply the Hardware Station with 90,000 tons of pig iron each year. The Import and Export Corporation will supply all the funds for the other one hundred small blast furnaces, and the local authorities will be responsible for purchasing the equipment. The Import and Export Corporation will provide funds according to the actual funds needed for furnace construction; after completion, the special district will supply the Import and Export Corporation with 40,000 tons of pig iron annually for four years.

The Import and Export Corporation also signed a contract with the Shuangtashan Iron and Steel Joint Factory in Chengde City. The total investment in the Shuangtashan Iron and Steel Plant is 150 million yuan, and 20 million yuan is needed this year, but the state has only provided 2.8 million yuan, a large shortfall. This time, the Import and Export Corporation agreed to invest 66 million yuan, 16 million yuan this year and 50 million yuan next year, and provide the steel plant with four sets of rolling equipment as part of the investment. The steel plant undertakes to supply the Import and Export Corporation with a certain amount of steel in installments before 1962.

The Chengde Special District has been able to accelerate the development of the iron and steel industry with the help of the two units; the Import and Export Corporation and the Hardware Station have obtained a fixed source of goods for export and to supply the rural areas with agricultural tools.

(Reported by our Tianjin correspondent on the 14th) The Chengde Special District of Hebei Province, which had no foundation in the iron and steel industry in the past, is now rapidly developing its iron and steel industry.

The Chengde Special District is implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects, and combining key state investments with mobilizing the masses to raise funds and build earthen furnaces. So far, the counties have built twenty-one small blast furnaces, ten of which have been put into production, and produced 281 tons of pig iron in the first half of the year. According to plan, the entire special district will build 200 small blast furnaces before November this year. At the same time, the modern mining project of the Damiao in Chengde City and the Shuangtashan medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprise are under intense construction, and iron will be produced this year. By the end of this year, the region will have the capacity to produce 400,000 tons of pig iron annually, and more than 100,000 tons of pig iron can be produced. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, in addition to continuing to build 300 more small blast furnaces in the region, a medium-sized iron and steel joint enterprise will be built in Qinglong, and six small iron and steel enterprise bases will be established in Pingquan, Luanping, Fengning, Chengde, Miyun, and Huairou counties. By 1962, the region will be able to produce 3 million tons of pig iron, 2 million tons of steel ingots, and 1.6 million tons of steel. It is estimated that the population will increase to 3 million at that time, so each person will have an average of one ton of pig iron and 0.66 tons of steel.

For the equipment, funds, technical force, and raw materials needed to develop the iron and steel industry, the Chengde Special District did not ask the state for them, but solved them independently. To build 200 small blast furnaces, more than 200 blowers (including spares) are needed. Since the state cannot supply them, they mobilized the machinery factories to cast and manufacture them themselves. (Attached picture)

    天津两贸易部门同承德专区签订合同
    互助两利发展钢铁工业
    承德专区自己制造鼓风机建设小高炉
    本报天津14日电　河北省承德专区最近同中国进出口公司天津分公司、中国五金机械公司天津五金采购供应站分别签订了两项互助合同。全专区今年计划建设的二百座小高炉，由五金站包了一百座。除了采矿由当地负责以外，建设小高炉所需要的设备、资金等完全由五金站负责，建筑材料或由双方负责或由一方负责采购，都由五金站出钱。这一百座小高炉建成以后，可以年产十五万吨生铁；从明年到1962年，每年由承德专区供给五金站九万吨生铁。另外一百座小高炉由进出口公司供给全部资金，设备由地方负责采购，进出口公司按建炉实际需要的资金给钱；建成以后，在四年中每年供给进出口公司生铁四万吨。
    进出口公司还和承德市双塔山钢铁联合厂签订了一份合同。双塔山钢铁厂全部投资是一点五亿元，今年需要投资二千万元，但国家只给了二百八十万元，相差很大。这次，进出口公司同意投资六千六百万元，今年给一千六百万，明年给五千万，并在投资中供给钢铁厂四套轧钢设备。钢铁厂承担的义务是在1962年以前分期供给进出口公司一定数量的钢材。
    承德专区得到了两单位的帮助，能够加速钢铁工业的发展；进出口公司和五金站取得了固定的货源，以便出口和供应农村制造农具。
    本报天津14日电　过去毫无钢铁工业基础的河北省承德专区，正在快马加鞭地发展钢铁工业。
    承德专区贯彻执行大中小相结合、国家重点投资与发动群众自筹土炼相结合的方针，到目前为止，各县已建成小高炉二十一座，有十座投入生产，上半年出产了生铁二百八十一吨。按照计划，全专区将在今年11月以前建成二百座小高炉。同时，承德市的大庙近代化采矿工程和双塔山中型钢铁联合企业，正在紧张施工，今年即可出铁，到今年年底，全区可达到年产生铁四十万吨的能力，可以出生铁十多万吨。在第二个五年计划期间，全区除继续再建小高炉三百座以外。还将在青龙建设一座中型钢铁联合企业，在平泉、滦平、丰宁、承德、密云、怀柔六县建立六个小型钢铁企业基地。到1962年。全区即可年产生铁三百万吨、钢锭二百万吨、钢材一百六十万吨。估计那时的人口将增加到三百万，那么每人即可平均有一吨生铁、零点六六吨钢。
    对于发展钢铁工业所需要的设备、资金、技术力量和原材料等，承德专区没有伸手向国家要，而是自力更生地解决。建设二百座小高炉，需要二百多台鼓风机（包括备用的），国家不能供应，他们就动员机械厂自己翻砂、自己制造。（附图片）
