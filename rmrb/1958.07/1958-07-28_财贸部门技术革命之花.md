The finance and trade departments of Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, are launching a mass technical innovation movement. According to incomplete statistics for July alone, 350 new technologies have been successfully tested. Here, we see a basically automated cotton purchasing station, and mechanized grain processing factories and grain supply stations. (Attached photo)

The Gaiping County Department Store created an automatic cloth rolling method and a fixed cloth measuring method. The cloth is rolled onto a wooden shaft on the cloth rack, and the dimensions are engraved on the cloth rack. When selling cloth, you only need to pull the cloth to measure the size, which improves the efficiency of cloth sales. (Attached photo)

The Xiongyue Town Grain Depot in Gaiping County created a foot-operated grain conveying machine, ending the heavy physical labor of carrying grain on shoulders to the granary, and increasing work efficiency by more than double.
