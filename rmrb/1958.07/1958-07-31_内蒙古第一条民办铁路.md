    Inner Mongolia's First Civilian-Run Railway
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 30th - Construction began on July 27th for Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's first civilian-run railway, a 45-kilometer line running from Ulanhot City to the Ma'anshan iron ore region.
    This railway is being built by the people of all ethnic groups in the Horqin Right Wing Front Banner and Ulanhot City, with strong support from farmers in neighboring areas. The locomotives, timber, and other materials needed for the railway are being manufactured and supplied with assistance from state-owned railway employees within the Hulunbuir League and workers in the Greater Khingan Range forest area. Local agricultural machinery factories and iron factories are using indigenous methods to smelt steel for casting rails. It is expected that the entire railway line will be open to traffic before National Day.
    The Ulanhot area is vigorously developing the iron and steel industry. In addition to a batch of iron smelting furnaces that have already been built and put into production, it has also been decided to expand an iron and steel plant into a medium-sized iron and steel complex. Therefore, the supply of ore has become very strained. At present, the transportation of ore from the Ma'anshan iron ore region mainly relies on animal-powered vehicles, which cannot meet the needs. After this railway is opened to traffic, the transportation cost will be much lower than that of automobiles, and the entire investment in the railway construction can be recovered within one year.

    内蒙古第一条民办铁路
    新华社呼和浩特30日电　内蒙古自治区第一条民办铁路——全长四十五公里的从乌兰浩特市到马鞍山铁矿区的铁路，27日动工兴建。
    这条铁路是由科尔沁右翼前旗和乌兰浩特市的各族人民在邻近各地的农民的大力支援下建设的。这条铁路需要的机车、木材等，正由呼伦贝尔盟境内的国营铁路员工和大兴安岭林区职工帮助制造供应。当地农业机械厂、铁工厂正用土法炼出钢铁来浇铸钢轨。预计国庆节前，这条铁路可以全线通车。
    乌兰浩特地区正在大办钢铁工业，除已建成一批炼铁炉投入生产外，还决定把一座钢铁厂扩建为中型钢铁联合企业，因而矿石供应显得非常紧张。目前这个地方从马鞍山铁矿区运输矿石，主要还是依靠畜力车辆，不能适应需要。这条铁路通车后，比汽车运输成本低得多，一年内就可全部收回修铁路的投资。
