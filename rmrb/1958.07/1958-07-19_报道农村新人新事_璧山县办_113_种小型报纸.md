Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 18th: In the midst of the great leap forward in production, Bishan County, Sichuan Province, has created 113 kinds of small newspapers in rural areas. Except for a few which are sponsored by the township party branches, most are created by the agricultural cooperatives, with over a thousand backbone personnel running the newspapers.

These small newspapers are mostly mimeographed and published every five to seven days. Their characteristic is that they write about local people and local affairs, which the masses love to read. For example, they publish resolutions of the township or cooperative regarding current production and work, announce the progress of production and work, and report on various important activities of the township and cooperative. Many small newspapers have also opened columns such as "Compare and See," "Hall of Fame," and "Experience Introduction," introducing local advanced individuals and advanced experiences, and writing short commentaries, speeches, and editorials based on current production and work issues. The forms of the small newspapers are also rich and diverse, including clapper talk, folk songs, news, communications, and sometimes cartoons. The "Production Newsletter" of the Dazi Cooperative in Qinggang Township is one of the earliest small newspapers established in the county. It has published 74 issues in the past two years, with about 100 copies printed per issue and distributed to various production teams throughout the cooperative. The editorial department of this small newspaper has one editor-in-chief, two editors who also serve as reporters, and a network of 25 correspondents distributed among the various teams.

    报道农村新人新事
    璧山县办113种小型报纸
    新华社成都18日电　四川省璧山县农村在生产大跃进中创办了一百一十三种小型报纸。其中除少数是乡的党支部主办的以外，都是各农业社创办的，共拥有上千人的办报骨干。
    这些小型报纸大都油印出版，五天到七天出一期。它们的特点是写当地人、当地事，群众爱看。例如刊登本乡或本社关于当前生产和工作的决议，公布生产、工作进度，报道本乡、本社各种重要活动；许多小报还开辟了“比比看”、“光荣榜”、“经验介绍”等专栏，介绍当地的先进人物和先进经验，根据当前生产和工作中的问题，撰写短评、讲话和社论。小报的形式也丰富多样。有快板、山歌、新闻、通讯，有时还刊登漫画。青杠乡大字社的“生产简报”，是全县创办最早的小报之一。两年来已出版七十四期，每期印一百来份，发往全社各生产组。这个小报的　辑部有总编辑一人，编辑兼记者二人，还拥有分布各队共二十五人的通讯员网。
