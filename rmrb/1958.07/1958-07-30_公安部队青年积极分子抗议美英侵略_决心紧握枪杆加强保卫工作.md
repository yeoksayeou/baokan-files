Xinhua News Agency, 29th. More than 500 young activists from public security forces across the country, at the opening of the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Garrison Department directly subordinate to the Public Security Forces Youth Activist Representative Conference on the 28th, angrily protested against the U.S. and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, and resolved to raise vigilance, firmly grasp guns, strengthen inland defense work, and safeguard the motherland and world peace.

　　Wang Ru, a special-class meritorious officer with the rank of captain who attended the 1950 National Combat Heroes Representative Conference, said angrily: "The heinous U.S. and British imperialists are really trying to shake a big tree with an ant, overestimating themselves. They dare to invade the Middle East, regardless of the protests of the people of the world. We love peace, but we will always hold the guns in our hands. If they dare to provoke a war, we will smash their heads with the weapons in our hands!" Wang Ming, the representative of the Fifth Squad of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, who captured thirty-one secret agents, spies, and illegal border crossers in two months, said: "The U.S. imperialists, who are playing with fire, are instigating their lackey Chiang Kai-shek to strengthen the dispatch of secret agents and spies to our mainland. We must be more vigilant, and no matter whether the secret agents and spies crawl in from the sea or are dropped from the sky, we will guarantee that they can come in, but they cannot go out; we will catch one if they come, and catch two if they come in pairs." Representatives of the railway public security forces are determined to guard culverts and bridges to ensure smooth railway transportation, so as to accelerate China's socialist construction. Representatives of the public security forces guarding cities, guarding agencies, factories, and mines are determined to ensure the absolute safety of the targets and be vigilant against all sabotage activities of hidden enemies. All representatives unanimously stated that while opposing imperialist aggression and supporting the struggle of the people of the Middle East, they must also closely watch the criminal activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and be ready to contribute everything they have to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace.

　　The conference passed a letter of protest against the U.S. and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. The protest letter said: "We solemnly warn the U.S. and British imperialists that if you are obsessed with your own ways and do not quickly get out of the Middle East, and insist on provoking a war, then only a dead end awaits you."
