Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 27th: After learning that the American and British aggressors continue to play with fire in the Middle East, and that American imperialism is directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan Strait, revolutionary military families in Shanghai have been writing to their relatives, urging them to be vigilant and intensify training. If the US-Chiang clique dares to risk an invasion, resolutely and thoroughly annihilate them.

    Gu Xiangyun, a military family member living at No. 18, Lane 121, Ruijin Road 1, repeatedly wrote to her son in the Air Force, saying, "To defend peace, we are willing to pay any price. The imperialists are invading the Middle East and threatening human peace; they should be taught a severe lesson." Wang Qiulian, a military family member who participated in demonstrations while ill to protest the US-British aggression in the Middle East, wrote to her two sons: "For the sake of millions of mothers, younger brothers and sisters, you strive to be the first to step onto the forefront of defending peace. We, mother and sons, resolutely oppose aggression and defend peace in different positions." After Zou Lihua, a military family member, read in the newspaper on the 25th that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was again clamoring about the already bankrupt "counterattack on the mainland," she immediately wrote to her son Tan Jimin in the Air Force: "If American planes and warships dare to invade us, you must resolutely shoot them down!" Shen Maishi, a military family member in his sixties and a traditional Chinese painter, not only wrote letters to encourage his son but also actively painted to support the just struggle of the Arab people.

    Many revolutionary soldiers, after receiving encouraging letters from their relatives, also wrote back to express their determination. Le Muzhen's son said in his reply: "I will listen to my mother and resolutely defend the motherland and defend peace. Wherever the motherland wants me to go, I will go." Dai Yundi's eldest son had been credited in the Korean War. In a letter to his mother, he said: "I fight for peace and am determined to prepare to liberate Taiwan at any time and realize the wishes of 600 million people."

    上海军人家属写信叮嘱亲人
    美蒋胆敢冒险就把它彻底消灭
    新华社上海27日电　上海市的革命军人家属在得到美英侵略者继续在中东玩火和美帝国主义指使蒋介石集团在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的消息以后，纷纷写信给自己的亲人，叮嘱他们提高警惕，加紧训练，如美蒋胆敢冒险进犯，就坚决把它们彻底消灭。
    住在瑞金一路一二一弄十八号的军属谷翔云一再写信给他在空军部队的儿子说，为了保卫和平，我们愿付出任何代价。帝国主义者侵略中东，威胁了人类和平，就该狠狠地教训它一顿。曾抱病参加示威游行抗议美英侵略中东的军属王秋莲在写信给她的两个儿子说：“为了千千万万母亲和弟弟妹妹，你力争第一个走上了保卫和平的最前哨。我们母子坚决在不同的岗位上反对侵略，保卫和平。军属邹丽华25日从报上看到蒋介石卖国集团又在叫嚣早已破产的“反攻大陆”的滥调后，立即给她在空军的儿子谭济民写信说：“美国飞机、兵舰胆敢侵犯我们，你就坚决打掉它！”年已花甲的军属沈迈士是位国画家，他一面写信勉励儿子，一面还积极绘画声援阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    许多革命军人在接到自己亲人的鼓励信以后，也纷纷回信表示决心。军属乐慕贞的儿子在回信中说：“听妈妈的话，坚决保卫祖国，保卫和平，祖国要我到哪儿，我就到哪儿。”戴芸娣的大儿子曾在朝鲜战场上立过功，他在给妈妈的信上说：“我为和平而战斗，决心准备着随时解放台湾，实现六亿人民的愿望。”
