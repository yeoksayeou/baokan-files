Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, July 22nd (TASS): The intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into Austrian airspace has aroused indignation among the Austrian public.

    "Tiroler Tageszeitung" wrote that such actions directly undermine Austria's neutrality, which is recognized by all countries. The newspaper called on the public to strongly protest against this.

    The Austrian correspondent of the West German newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung" reported: "The flight of U.S. military aircraft in Austrian airspace has significantly worsened public sentiment. People are worried that Austria's neutrality will be useless at a critical moment. Harsh condemnations of the Americans can now be heard."

    The Austrian public is deeply satisfied with the Soviet Union's note to the United States regarding the violation of Austrian neutrality.
