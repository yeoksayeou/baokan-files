Qingxu County Produces High-Quality Fertilizer

The employees of the Qingxu County Chemical Industry Cooperative in Shanxi Province have broken away from the old way of thinking that saltpeter soil could only produce brine, saltpeter, and earth salt for thousands of years. They extract chemical raw materials from the brine made from saltpeter soil and use these raw materials to produce high-quality fertilizer. Please take a look at their production tools and site: The right picture shows the equipment of this industrial cooperative—two large pots and a stone mill. The upper picture shows their open-air batching section. All of this is extremely simple, but the revolutionary people have used them to create inspiring and significant achievements!

    清徐县制成优质化肥
    山西清徐县化学工业社的职工，打破几千年硝土只能生产卤水、火硝和土盐的旧圈子，用硝土制成的卤水提出化学原料，并利用这些原料制成了优等质量的化肥。请大家看看他们的生产工具和场地吧：右图就是这个工业社的设备--两口大锅、一盘石碾，上图就是他们的露天配料工段。这一切都是简单不过的，然而革命的人民却利用它们创造了振奋人心的重大成就！　梁毅摄（新华社稿）
