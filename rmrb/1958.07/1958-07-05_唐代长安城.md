Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th: Archaeological personnel have confirmed through exploration and excavation that Chang'an City of the Tang Dynasty, which was once a center for cultural exchanges between China and the world, was one of the largest cities in the medieval world. It was nine kilometers long from east to west and seven and a half kilometers wide from north to south, six times larger than the current city of Xi'an. The Daming Palace in the north of the city was the most magnificent of the Tang Dynasty palaces. Currently, archaeological personnel have reached relatively accurate judgments on the overall layout of the Tang Dynasty capital and the locations of the palaces.

    During exploration of the outer city wall ruins, nine city gates from that time were discovered. Zhaode Gate was the largest, with very grand architecture, featuring five gate openings, each 6.5 meters wide. From the city gate ruins, fragments of white ash wall painted with red color, stone foundations, wood ash, and other artifacts were collected. The relics are abundant, and the rammed earth is also relatively well preserved.

    The Furong Garden, a place of great scenic beauty at the time, was located in the southeastern corner of the outer city. The western part of the garden was the famous Qujiang Pool. These relics were either inconsistently recorded or not recorded at all in previous documents. The on-site exploration has supplemented and corrected these records.

    Excavation work on the Daming Palace wall ruins has confirmed that the palace was nearly 2.5 kilometers long from north to south and 1.5 kilometers wide. Outside the north and east palace walls, additional walls and covered roads not recorded in the literature were discovered. The Jinluan Hall site within the palace—where emperors and ministers frequently discussed state affairs—is currently being excavated and cleared.

    Archaeological personnel also discovered more than thirty rare clay seals near this site. These were seals used on tribute items presented by foreign officials to the emperor. The characters written in ink on the clay seals by the ancients more than 1,100 years ago are still clearly visible.

    The ruins of six gates of another large palace of the Tang Dynasty, Xingqing Palace, as well as the Dragon Pool, Changqing Hall, and the Hanlin Academy within the palace, have also been explored. Among these buildings, the ruins of Xingqing Hall and Chuyang Gate are relatively well preserved. The sites of the Qin Zheng Wu Ben Tower and the Hua'e Xiang Hui Tower within the palace are paved with square bricks and square stone pillar bases.

    唐代长安城
    新华社西安4日电考古人员从探测和发掘中证实：曾经是我国和世界文化往来集中地的唐代长安城，是中世纪世界上的大城市之一。它东西长九公里，南北宽七点五公里，比现在的西安城大六倍。城北的大昭宫是唐朝宫室中最壮丽的一座。现在，考古人员对整个唐代京城的形势和宫殿的位置等，都已经得出了比较正确的判断。
    在外廓城的遗址上，钻探出了当时的九座城门。昭德门是最大的一座，建筑非常宏伟，共有五个门洞，每个门洞宽六点五公尺。从城门遗址中还采集到绘有红彩的白灰墙皮块、石础、木灰等，遗物很丰富，夯土也保存得比较完整。
    当时风景十分优美的芙蓉园，在外廓城的东南角。园内的西部便是著名的曲江池。以上这些遗迹，原来文献中记载不一，或者没有记载；现在从实地钻探所得，对这些记载作了补充和更正。
    大昭宫宫墙遗迹发掘工作证实，这座宫南北长近二点五公里，宽一点五公里。在北边和东边的宫墙外面，还发现了文献中没有记载的夹城复道。宫内的金銮遗址——过去帝王和大臣们经常在这里商议国家大事的地方，现在正在发掘清理。
    考古人员还在这个遗址附近发现了三十多块稀有的封泥。这是当时外臣们向帝王进贡时，器物上加用的封印。一千一百多年前，古人用墨笔在封泥上写的字迹，还看得很清楚。
    唐朝的另一个大宫——兴庆宫的六个门和宫内的龙池、长庆殿和翰林院等遗迹，也已经钻探出来。在这些建筑物中，兴庆殿和初阳门的遗迹保存得比较完整。宫内的勤政务本楼和花萼相辉楼的遗址中，平铺着方砖和方形石柱础。
