Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Ministry of Culture recently issued a notice to the cultural bureaus and publishing bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as all central-level publishing houses, regarding lowering the pricing standards for books and textbooks. According to the Ministry of Culture's calculations, based on the current achievements in the great leap forward in national publishing work, book prices can potentially be reduced by an average of about 15%.

The notice pointed out: When lowering book prices, different treatments should be applied based on the nature, content, and target audience of the publications. For readings that support current political movements, learning movements, and economic construction tasks, cultural textbooks and popular readings published to consolidate literacy achievements should have their prices reduced as much as possible. Popular science and technology books, natural science and technical science textbooks for universities and secondary specialized schools, and general natural science and technical science books should have their prices appropriately reduced. Works of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social science should be priced lower than works of idealistic schools of thought. Works with modern themes should be priced lower than classical works. Among modern works, excellent works with significant educational significance should be priced lower than general modern works. Ancient books that are worth recommending to the masses should be priced lower than those only for expert reference and research.

Before issuing this notice, the Ministry of Culture had exchanged opinions with some central-level publishing houses regarding book pricing. The notice stipulates that in the future, book pricing standards will be formulated by publishing units themselves based on the above principles, and they should constantly study reactions from all parties and continuously revise them.

Since liberation, book prices have been reduced several times. Adjusted by the price index, the average book price in 1957 was only about 44% of what it was in 1936.

    书籍降低定价标准
    文化部向全国文化出版部门发出通知
    新华社9日讯  文化部最近向各省、自治区、直辖市的文化局、出版局和中央级各出版社发出了降低书籍和课本定价标准的通知。根据文化部计算，按照目前全国出版工作跃进的成绩，书价平均有可能降低15％左右。
    通知指出：降低书籍定价的时候，要根据出版物的性质、内容和读者对象，区别对待。配合当前政治运动、学习运动和经济建设任务的读物，为了巩固扫盲成绩而出版的文化课本和通俗读物，定价要尽可能多降些；普及性自然科学和科学技术书籍，高等学校、中等专业学校的自然科学、技术科学类课本和一般自然科学、技术科学类书籍，应适当降低定价；马克思列宁主义哲学、社会科学著作应比唯心主义各学派的著作定价低些；现代题材作品应比古典作品的定价低些；现代作品中优秀的有重大教育意义的作品应比一般现代作品的定价低些；古籍中值得向群众推荐的又应比只供专家参考研究用的定价低些。
    文化部在发出这个通知以前，曾和部分中央级出版社交换过关于书籍定价的意见。通知中规定今后图书的定价标准，由出版单位根据上面的原则自行制订，并且随时研究各方面的反应，不断修订。
    解放以来，书价已几度降低。按物价指数折算，1957年书籍定价平均只合1936年时候的44％左右。
