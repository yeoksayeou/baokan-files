    The Thinnest Steel Sheet

    Lin Lai'ren, a young worker and Communist Party member at the No. 3 Rolling Mill of the Suzhou Zhongnan Iron and Steel Plant, successfully rolled 0.02 mm thin steel sheet on the morning of June 20th. Verified by a micrometer, the thickness was accurate. This is a miracle in China's thin steel rolling technology.

    Lin Lai'ren encountered many difficulties in the process of trial-rolling 0.02 mm thin steel sheet. For example, even after inserting 0.03 mm thin steel into the rollers and repeatedly rolling it, it still wouldn't become thinner. However, he discovered that the reason it couldn't be further thinned was that the rollers were heating up, affecting their hardness. So he used an electric fan to blow air and continuously poured soapy water to lower the temperature, and he frequently tempered the steel sheet. While rolling the steel sheet, he constantly added oil, solving the difficulties and finally achieving success. (Xinhua Daily)

    最薄的钢皮
    苏州市中南轧铁厂三号轧车青年工人、共产党员林来仁，在6月20日上午轧出了○·○二公厘薄钢皮。经千分表检验，丝数准足。这是我国在轧薄钢技术上的奇迹。
    林来仁在试轧○·○二公厘薄钢皮的过程中，碰到了不少困难。如把○·○三公厘的薄钢塞进轧辊，一次又一次的延压，还是压不薄。但他发现不能继续压薄的原因是轧辊发热，影响轧辊的硬度后，就采用电风扇吹与不断浇肥皂水来降低温度，并把钢皮勤回火。在轧钢皮时，不断加油，解决了困难，终于获得成功。　（新华日报）
