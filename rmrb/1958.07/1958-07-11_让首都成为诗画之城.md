    Let the Capital Become a City of Poetry and Painting

    Some time ago, I had the opportunity to visit Zhangjiakou Prefecture with the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles delegation headed by Guo Moruo. Along the way, we saw the mass creative upsurge of "ten thousand poems written on the wall" and murals everywhere, which stimulated the inspiration of poets and painters. Everyone enthusiastically wrote poems and painted to praise the labor and creation of the people. Guo Lao personally took the lead in writing poems on the streets. Painters have demonstrated the spirit of collectivism in their creations. Wu Zuoren, Ye Qianyu, Jiang Zhaohe, Shao Yu, and Xiao Shufang, these painters of different schools and styles, created large-scale propaganda murals in a short period of time, showing the great leap forward style of the painters.

    However, when we returned to the capital, after leaving Qianmen Station and passing through Tiananmen Square, East Chang'an Street, Wangfujing and other transportation hubs, we felt a sense of loss. We could not see the large-scale, inspiring and deeply meaningful propaganda murals and the spirited labor hymns that we saw in the urban and rural areas of Huailai, Zhuolu, and other places. Recalling the time when the painters jointly designed the mural that asked Guo Lao to inscribe "Calling mountains to offer treasures, calling water to obey orders, a great leap forward in industry and agriculture," everyone imagined: Wouldn't it be more meaningful if there were such large-scale propaganda paintings on both sides of Tiananmen in Beijing, instead of just letting film advertisements and commercial advertisements compete for the audience? Under the brilliant light of the general line, the people of Beijing are striving with unparalleled vigor to transform the capital into a modern industrialized city within five years. Many moving deeds have emerged among the masses, which require the poets and painters of the capital to depict.

    In recent days, some medium-sized murals have appeared in the city. What is exciting is that I saw a large mural with rich national characteristics and promoting the general line at the south entrance of Wangfujing. This is a collaboration by all the teachers of the Chinese Painting Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and it has attracted great attention from passers-by. I sincerely hope that the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and relevant units can organize the poets and painters of the capital to work together to bring the best poems that promote the general line and praise the hard work of the workers and peasants of the capital, as well as the inspiring large-scale murals, to the streets, so that the capital can also become a city of poetry and painting that praises the working people.

### 让首都成为诗画之城

    让首都成为诗画之城
    前些日子，我有机会随以郭沫若为首的中国文联参观团到张家口专区访问。沿途，我们看到了“万首诗歌写满墙”和到处是壁画的群众创作热潮，它激起了诗人和画家的灵感，大家热情地写诗作画来歌颂人民的劳动创造。郭老亲自带头上街题诗。画家们在创作中更是发挥了集体主义的精神。吴作人、叶浅予、蒋兆和、邵宇、萧淑芳这几位不同流派、不同风格的画家，在短促的时间里创作了大幅的宣传壁画，显示出画家们的跃进作风。
    可是，当我们回到首都以后，从前门车站出来，经过天安门广场、东长安街、王府井等交通要道，不觉如有所失。我们看不到在怀来、涿鹿等地城乡中所见到的那种大幅激动人心、喻意深刻的宣传壁画和意志高昂的劳动赞歌。回想画家们一块儿设计那幅请郭老题作
  “叫山献宝，叫水听命，工农业大跃进”的壁画时，大家曾想像着：如果北京天安门两旁也有这样的大幅宣传画，而不只让电影广告、商业广告在那里争取观众，岂不更有意义？在总路线的光辉照耀下，全北京市人民正以无比干劲争取五年内把首都变为现代工业化城市，群众中产生了许许多多动人事迹，需要首都的诗人和画家来描绘。
    最近几天，本市陆续出现了一些中型的壁画。令人兴奋的是，我在王府井南口看到一幅富有民族色彩、宣传总路线的大壁画。这是中央美术学院中国画系全体教师合作的，它引起了往来行人很大的注意。我衷心地希望中国文联、北京市文联和有关单位，能够组织首都的诗人、画家一齐动手，把宣传总路线和歌颂首都工农群众干劲的最好诗篇和振奋人心的大幅壁画送上街头，让首都也成为歌颂劳动人民的诗画之城。
