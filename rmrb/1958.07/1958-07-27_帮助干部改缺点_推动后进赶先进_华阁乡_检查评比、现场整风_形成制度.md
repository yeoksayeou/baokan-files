Helping Cadres Correct Shortcomings, Promoting the Backward to Catch Up with the Advanced
    Huage Township's "Inspection and Appraisal, On-Site Rectification" Forms a System

    (Our correspondent Gao Changren reports) The Party Committee of Huage Township, Nanxian County, Hunan Province, has created a working method of "inspection and appraisal, on-site rectification." This method, which combines on-site visits with rectification, making rectification regular and systematic, has achieved significant results in the township. Now, the unbalanced situation of the township's fourteen agricultural cooperatives, which originally had seven first-class cooperatives, three second-class cooperatives, and four third-class cooperatives, has been reversed, and the 15,000 mu of early rice in the township are generally growing well. Due to the frequent carrying out of criticism and self-criticism, the ideological style and working methods of all township and cooperative cadres are constantly being improved. Large-scale cooperation between cooperatives, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced have formed a new atmosphere.

    Last winter, when the township conducted rectification among township and cooperative cadres, it adopted the approach of separating from the current central work and conducting closed-door rectification, so the gains were not significant. Because closed-door rectification sometimes relaxed the leadership over the central work. Once, the township Party committee found that the Dongfanghong Cooperative had universally applied a first fertilizer application in the fields and improved more than 800 mu of soil, while the Jishan Cooperative, with the same conditions, had only applied fertilizer to 30% of the fields and had not yet taken action to improve the soil. At that time, the township Party committee pointed out the shortcomings of the Jishan Cooperative, but the branch secretary of this cooperative, Xu Changsheng, was not convinced, believing that his cooperative had made great achievements and that other cooperatives were boasting. Therefore, the township Party committee organized a township-wide inspection and appraisal, and Xu Changsheng was speechless only after personally seeing the achievements of the Dongfanghong Cooperative. After the inspection and appraisal, a meeting was held on-site, at which township and cooperative cadres praised the achievements of the Dongfanghong Cooperative, and at the same time, helped the Jishan Cooperative analyze the reasons for its backward production.

    This inspection and appraisal, naturally combined with rectification, not only educated Xu Changsheng, but also educated all township and cooperative cadres. This on-site meeting was not only a production meeting to promote the central work, but also a rectification meeting to improve the ideological consciousness of cadres. The township Party committee summarized the successful experience of this meeting and established a system: the township would conduct inspection and appraisal and on-site rectification once a month, and the cooperatives would conduct inspection and appraisal even more frequently than the township.

    In this way, from last winter to the end of June this year, the township has held nine inspection and appraisal, on-site rectification meetings. Each meeting has promoted the central work. The content of the rectification sometimes involved ideological issues, and sometimes working methods. Because the interval between each meeting was not long, the township and cooperative cadres were constantly reminded, so the shortcomings and mistakes that occurred in the work could be overcome in a timely manner. On June 25, it was discovered that the Desheng Cooperative, which was originally a first-class cooperative, was slow in accumulating fertilizer in the summer. After "inspection and appraisal, on-site rectification," the complacency of the branch secretary and cooperative management cadres was criticized, which not only enabled the Desheng Cooperative to immediately take measures and quickly improve, but also alerted all township and cooperative cadres and promoted the summer fertilizer accumulation campaign throughout the township.

    In the "inspection and appraisal, on-site rectification," the Huage Township Party Committee strictly criticized the unhealthy ideological tendencies of township and cooperative cadres on the one hand, and objectively analyzed the specific difficulties of the backward cooperatives on the other hand, and actively helped to solve them. In this way, the cooperative cadres who were criticized not only solved ideological problems, but also solved practical difficulties. In addition, in the process of backward cooperatives catching up with advanced cooperatives, if it was found that a backward cooperative had created advanced experience in a certain task, the township Party committee would organize all cooperatives to visit, appraise, and learn from the experience there. This fundamentally reversed the past practice of criticizing and blaming backward cooperatives more and helping and encouraging them less, prompting backward cooperatives to have the confidence to strive for progress, so that they would not feel pressured.

    After Huage Township established the "inspection and appraisal, on-site rectification" system, the work of the township was full of vitality, and all tasks were overfulfilled. The cadres of each cooperative strived to do a good job to meet the inspection and appraisal. If a few cooperatives were slightly behind in one task, the cooperative cadres would be very anxious and strive to catch up before the inspection and appraisal. In this way, the waves of the future push the waves of the past, and they compete with each other. Among the fourteen cooperatives in the township, it is impossible to find an obvious backward cooperative, and the agricultural production achievements of each cooperative can be compared with those of the advanced cooperatives.

    帮助干部改缺点　推动后进赶先进
    华阁乡“检查评比、现场整风”形成制度
    本报讯　记者高长任报道：湖南省南县华阁乡党委会创造了“检查评比、现场整风”的工作方法。这种把现场参观和整风相结合，使整风经常化、制度化的方法，已在这个乡收到显著的效果。现在，全乡十四个农业社中，原来有七个一类社、三个二类社、四个三类社的不平衡局面扭转了，全乡一万五千亩早稻，普遍生长良好。由于经常开展批评与自我批评，全体乡、社干部的思想作风和工作方法，不断得到提高和改进。社与社之间的大协作，学先进、赶先进、已经形成一种新的风气。
    去年冬季，这个乡在乡、社干部中进行整风时，采取了脱离当前中心工作、关门整风的做法，因此收获不大。因为关门整风，有时还放松了对中心工作的领导。有一次，乡党委发现东方红社已在田里普遍施一道肥，改良土壤八百多亩，而条件相同的寄山社只有30％的田里施了肥，改良土壤还没行动。当时，乡党委就指出寄山社的缺点，但这个社的支部书记徐长生不服气，认为本社成绩很大，别的社是吹牛皮。于是乡党委组织了一次全乡性的检查评比，徐长生亲自看到东方红社的成绩才无话可说。检查评比后，就在现场开会，到会乡社干部表扬了东方红社的成绩，同时，也帮助寄山社分析生产落后的原因。
    这次检查评比，很自然地结合进行整风，不仅教育了徐长生，也教育了全体乡社干部。这次现场会议不仅是推动中心工作的生产会，也是提高干部思想觉悟的整风会。乡党委总结这次会议的成功经验，就确定一个制度：全乡每月检查评比、现场整风一次，社里的检查评比比乡里还要经常。
    这样，从去冬开始到今年6月底，全乡召开过九次检查评比、现场整风会。每一次会议都推动了中心工作。整风的内容，有时有思想问题，也有工作方法问题。由于每次间隔时间不长，经常给乡、社干部敲警钟，因此，工作中发生的缺点和错误，都能及时克服。6月25日发现原来是一类社的德胜社夏季积肥进度缓慢，经过“检查评比、现场整风”，批判了这个社的支部书记和办社干部的松气思想，不仅使德胜社立即采取措施，迅速改进，也使全体乡社干部引起警惕，推动了全乡的夏季积肥运动。
    华阁乡党委会在“检查评比、现场整风”中，一方面严格批判了乡、社干部中的不良思想倾向，另一方面，也客观地分析了工作后进社的具体困难，积极帮助解决。这样，使受到批评的社干部，不仅解决了思想问题，也解决了实际困难，此外，在后进社赶先进社的过程中，如果发现后进社在某一项工作中创造了先进经验，乡党委就组织各社到那里去参观评比，学习经验，这样，就根本扭转了过去对后进社批评指责多，帮助鼓励少的做法，促使后进社有信心力争上游，不至于感到有压力。
    华阁乡把“检查评比、现场整风”形成制度以后，全乡工作生气勃勃，各项任务都超额完成。各社干部都力争做好工作，迎接检查评比，少数社如果有一项工作稍微落后，社干部就很着急，努力在检查评比前赶上去，这样后浪推前浪，互相竞赛，在全乡十四个社中，就找不到明显的后进社，各社农业生产的成绩都能向先进社看齐。
