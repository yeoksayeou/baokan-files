Xinhua News Agency, London, July 1st: Wilson, the Labour Party's economic affairs spokesman, spoke in the House of Commons today about the depression in the British cotton textile industry. The cotton textile industry is one of Britain's most important traditional industries.

Wilson emphasized that the depression in the cotton textile industry is occurring "at a time of sharply decreasing exports, decreasing domestic demand, and large stockpiles," making the situation particularly critical. In 1954, the volume of British cotton textile exports was the lowest since Britain first had cotton textile export statistics in 1840, and since 1954, the volume of cotton textile exports has decreased by another 25%.

From 1954 to 1957, 261 cotton textile factories closed. According to Wilson, 46 more factories have closed in the first five months of this year, and "several more have closed since the beginning of this month (June)." He said, "It is heartbreaking that some of the factories that are now closing are the most modern, efficient, and well-equipped factories in Lancashire."

The number of workers employed in the cotton textile industry has been steadily declining. According to official statistics, 100,000 workers have left the cotton textile industry in the past seven years. Wilson said: "The number of workers employed in the cotton textile industry has actually decreased by a quarter." He said, "The situation in various regions is getting worse and worse. Cotton textile cities are beginning to repeat the tragedy of the old depressed areas before the war - residents are flowing into other regions, especially young people, because they have no future."

    出口剧烈下降　国内需求减少
    英国棉织业越来越萧条
    据新华社伦敦1日电　英国工党经济问题发言人威尔逊今天在议会下院谈到了英国棉织业的萧条景象。棉织业是英国最重要的传统工业之一。
    威尔逊强调指出：棉织业的萧条是在“出口剧烈下降、国内需求减少以致存货大量堆积的时候”发生的，因而情况特别危急。1954年英国棉织品出口数量是自从1840年英国第一次有棉织品出口统计数字以来最低的一年，而自从1954年以来，棉织品的出口数量又减少了25％。
    从1954年到1957年，有二百六十一家棉纺织工厂关闭。据威尔逊说，今年头五个月又有四十六家工厂关闭，“本月（6月）初以来，又有好几家关闭”。他说，“使人感到痛心的是，现在关闭的工厂有些是兰开夏最现代化的、效率高和装备好的工厂。”
    棉织业的就业工人人数一直在不断下降。据官方统计，过去七年来有十万工人离开了棉织业。威尔逊说：“棉织业的就业工人人数实际上减少了四分之一。”他说，“各个地区的情况都是愈来愈糟。棉织业城市正在开始重演战前旧萧条区的悲剧——居民流入其他地区，尤其是年轻人，因为他们没有前途”。
