    Ten Poems of Resentment
    Li Jishen

    I. Empires have always been built on colonialism,
    Their savage plunder has darkened the world.
    So many unjust grievances in human history,
    Liberation must ultimately bring justice.

    II. The "free world" speaks sweet words,
    But profits itself by harming others.
    The insightful Roland once exclaimed:
    "How many crimes are committed in the name!"

    III. Who can rival its hegemonic ambitions,
    Occupying air and sea bases across the globe?
    "Security" and "self-defense" are utter lies,
    Its schemes of aggression never cease.

    IV. The East Wind awakens Iraq,
    The nation proudly raises the flag of independence.
    Internal affairs must be determined autonomously,
    What justification is there for armed intervention?

    V. "Robbers always hate their masters,"
    "Protecting overseas citizens" is a flimsy excuse.
    Such brazen sophistry is truly shameless,
    Playing with fire will surely lead to self-immolation.

    VI. The forces of peace grow stronger daily,
    Enraging the warmongers of the West.
    Iraq's birth as a new victory,
    Makes them frantic, like dogs jumping over walls.

    VII. Who defends peace, who wages war?
    The contrast between the camps is clear.
    The war fiend is inherently warlike,
    But cannot withstand the roar of the world.

    VIII. Forgetting the bitter defeat at Suez,
    It resumes stirring up conflict in Lebanon.
    Flames of anger ignite across the world,
    Destroying its evil claws in the mud.

    IX. The East Wind has already prevailed over the West Wind,
    A mantis trying to stop a chariot is foolishly overconfident.
    The giant wheel of the times cannot be stopped,
    It will surely transform into a grain beetle.

    X. Independence must be fought for,
    Strengthening unity builds a fortress of will.
    From now on, the world will be filled with brothers,
    Wiping out the war demons will surely bring peace.

    书愤诗十首
    李济深一帝国由来肆殖民，凶残掠夺世为昏，人间多少沉冤事，解放终须正义伸。二自由世界说声声，害尽他人利己生，高识罗兰曾慨说：“几多罪恶假名行。”三称霸称王世孰侔，海空基地占全球，“安全”“自卫”真胡说，侵略阴谋日未休。四东风唤醒伊拉克，民族高扬独立旗，内政原须由自主，武装干涉究何词。五“强盗由来恨主人”，护侨借口岂成因，强词夺理真无耻，玩火终看焚自身。六和平力量日增强，妒煞西方好战狂，伊国诞生新胜利，恼它狗急又跳墙。七孰卫和平孰战争，阵营对比最分明，战魔好战纵成性，难抗寰球怒吼声。八竟忘惨败苏伊士；又复兴戎利约黎，怒火遍燃全世界，毁它魔爪委泥犁。九东风原已压西风，螳臂当车妄自雄，时代巨轮挡不住，管教一转化沙虫。十独立须从奋斗争，加强团结志成城，从今四海多兄弟，歼尽战魔定太平。
