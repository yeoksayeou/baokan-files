Editorial Notes:

    The mass transportation technology revolution movement that has arisen in Sichuan Province to adapt to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is a timely and important measure.
    The reform of transportation tools can greatly reduce physical labor and liberate a large amount of labor force to be used in large-scale production. This is not only good for improving production, but also can rationally adjust labor, thereby consolidating the booming morale.
    The reform of transportation tools can also greatly increase the volume of transportation, thereby alleviating the tension of transportation. The methods adopted by Sichuan Province of combining wooden boats with motorization and automobiles with trailers, etc., combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining new and old technologies, can all be promoted.
    With the improvement of transportation, the products produced by the great leap forward in industry and agriculture can be exchanged more and faster; socialist construction can be accelerated, and people's lives can be improved even better.

    快运多运解放劳动力
    为了适应工农业生产的大跃进，四川省兴起的群众性的交通运输技术革命运动，是一项非常适时的重要措施。
    交通运输工具的改革，可以大大减轻体力劳动，解放出大量劳动力用到大搞生产上去。这不仅对提高生产有好处，也可以合理调剂劳力，从而巩固兴旺的士气。
    运输工具的改革，还可以大大提高运输量，从而缓和交通运输的紧张情况。四川省采用的木船加机动，汽车挂拖车等等土洋结合、新旧技术结合的办法，都是可以推行的。
    交通运输改善了，工农业大跃进所生产的产品，才能更多更快地交流；社会主义建设才能加速，人民的生活也才能改善得更好。
