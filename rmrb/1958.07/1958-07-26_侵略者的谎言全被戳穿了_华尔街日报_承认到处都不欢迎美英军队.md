Invaders' Lies Completely Exposed
"Wall Street Journal" Admits US-British Troops Are Unwelcome Everywhere
Editor's Note: The following two articles are an editorial from the American "Wall Street Journal" on the 22nd and an excerpt from a dispatch from Amman by the same newspaper. The "Wall Street Journal" is not published in Cairo or Moscow. It is one of the organs of American monopoly capitalists – the National Association of Manufacturers of the United States. These two articles admit a universal fact: in the eyes of the people of Lebanon and Jordan, the US-British invading forces are by no means "invited" "friends," but genuine imperialist occupation troops. The US-British acts of aggression are not only hated and loathed by the people of the two countries but are also very isolated in various countries around the world, even among their allies. However, to this day, the US-British invaders are still denying their crimes of aggression, insisting that they are protecting the "freedom" of Lebanon and Jordan. Here, the "Wall Street Journal" completely exposes all the lies of the US-British invaders.

　　At that time (note: referring to the time when the United States decided to invade Lebanon), the reaction of our friends was also taken into consideration. Although we realized that they might silently shake their heads, like a person silently shaking his head at a friend's rash actions, we believed at the time that they would not condemn us. But a storm of criticism has already been set off in West Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Even our closest allies, the Canadians, felt very uneasy.

　　If the reaction of our friends surprised us, it was nothing compared to the misjudgment of the feelings of the Lebanese people. None of those close to the White House or the State Department could have imagined that our actions would cause the kind of reaction that is now occurring in Lebanon.

　　Our reporter, Vick, wrote from Beirut yesterday that sending troops there not only deepened the rift between the rebels (referring to the insurgent forces) and the Chamoun government, but also actually split the pro-Western group into two factions from the middle. The Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, who a week ago was supporting President Chamoun and his troubled government, now calls the American landing an "act of aggression." His opinion "has resonated with other political activists who were previously listed in the pro-Western camp."

　　On the people's side, a Middle East Airlines pilot told Vick, "Our problem is a domestic affair" and does not require US action. A Lebanese engineer educated in the United States said, "This is my country. I don't want armed Americans occupying it."

　　Vick's assessment of the widespread opposition to the US troop deployment policy is not his alone. Scripps-Howard newspaper reporter Henry Taylor reported that even the Lebanese army was split into two factions on this issue. Lebanese Army Commander Shehab found it difficult to stop some of his soldiers from opposing the Americans. When the Marines landed, they were blocked by Lebanese government troops with tanks and guns, and General Shehab had to mediate with his own troops to allow the Americans to pass safely.

　　It was not difficult to estimate the disadvantages of sending troops to Lebanon. However, our government thought at the time that showing force would be good for the Lebanese, for all small country governments, and for ourselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The resentment of the Lebanese people towards American intervention has cost us supporters there and strengthened the rebels. Even the benefits we originally thought our adventure could bring have turned against us.

### 侵略者的谎言全被戳穿了  “华尔街日报”承认到处都不欢迎美英军队

    侵略者的谎言全被戳穿了
    “华尔街日报”承认到处都不欢迎美英军队
    编者按　下面发表的两篇文章，是美国“华尔街日报”22日的一篇社论和该报发自安曼的一篇通讯的摘要。“华尔街日报”既不是在开罗、也不是在莫斯科出版的，它是美国垄断资本家们——美国全国制造商协会的机关报之一。这两篇文章承认了一个普遍的事实：在黎巴嫩和约旦人民眼睛里，美英侵略军根本不是什么“邀请”来的“朋友”，而是地道的帝国主义的占领军。美英的侵略行为，不仅受到两国人民的痛恨和仇视，在世界各国以至它们的同盟国中，也是十分孤立的。可是，直到今天，美英侵略者还在抵赖他们的侵略罪行，硬说他们是保护黎巴嫩和约旦的“自由”。在这里，“华尔街日报”却完全戳穿了美英侵略者的一切谎言。
    当时（按：指美国决定侵入黎巴嫩时），我们朋友的反应也受到考虑。虽然我们认识到他们可能默默摇头，好像一个人对一个朋友的轻率行动默默摇头一样，当时，我们却认为他们不会谴责我们。但是在西德、日本和瑞典已经掀起了一阵批评的风暴。甚至我们最亲密的盟友加拿大人也感到很不安。
    如果说我们朋友们的反应使我们感到意外的话，那末，同对我们对黎巴嫩国内的感情的错误估计相比，那就算不了一回事。接近白宫或国务院的人士中没有一个人当初能够设想到我们的行动会引起现在在黎巴嫩所引起的那种反应。
    我们的记者维克昨天从贝鲁特写道，派兵到那里的问题不仅加深了叛军（指起义部队）和夏蒙政府之间的裂痕，而且在实际上使亲西方集团从中间分裂成两派。黎巴嫩议会议长在一星期以前是支持夏蒙总统和他的困难的政府的，现在他把美国的登陆称为“侵略行动”。他的意见“引起了其他以前被列在亲西方阵营内的政治活动家的响应”。
    在人民方面，有一个中东航空公司的驾驶员对维克说，“我们的问题是一个内政问题”，不需要美国采取行动。一个在美国受教育的黎巴嫩工程师说，“这是我的国家。我不希望武装的美国人占领它。”
    维克对人们广泛反对美国派兵政策的估计也不是他一个人的估计。斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸记者亨利·泰勒报道说，甚至黎巴嫩的陆军在这个问题上也从中间分裂为两派。黎巴嫩陆军司令谢哈布发现很难阻止他的一部分士兵反对美国人。当海军陆战队登陆的时候，他们遭到了拥有坦克和枪炮的忠于政府的黎巴嫩军队的阻挡，谢哈布将军不得不向他自己的军队进行调解，才使美国人可以安全通过。
    本来不难估计出兵黎巴嫩的不利之处。但是，我们的政府当时认为显示一下武力对黎巴嫩人、对所有小国政府以及对我们自己都有好处。不幸，事情并不是这样。黎巴嫩人民对美国干涉的愤恨已经使我们在那里失去了支持者而加强了叛乱分子的力量。甚至我们原来认为我们的冒险可以带来的好处也已经变成对我们不利的因素了。
