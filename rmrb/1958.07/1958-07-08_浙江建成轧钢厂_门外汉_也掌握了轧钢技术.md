In the High-Speed Advance

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 7th: The steel rolling plant established by the Zhejiang Provincial Light Industry Department began production on the 4th of this month.

Currently, the plant mainly rolls steel materials with diameters ranging from six to nine centimeters, with an annual output of six thousand to ten thousand tons. This type of steel can be used as rebar for large buildings and can also be used to manufacture the nail teeth of rice threshers, various screws, rivets, and hardware parts. In the future, the plant will continue to build blooming and rolling workshops to produce flat steel and steel for manufacturing agricultural tools. The plant began construction in early May. Most of the more than two hundred workers in the plant were transferred from service cooperatives, barber shops, sewing cooperatives, hardware cooperatives, etc., and lacked experience in steel rolling. However, they have a communist style of daring to think and act. Now, these "laymen" have basically mastered the steel rolling technology.

All the equipment in the plant is refurbished from old goods. It was repaired through the collaborative research of the employees.

    浙江建成轧钢厂
    “门外汉”也掌握了轧钢技术
    据新华社杭州7日电  浙江省轻工业厅举办的轧钢厂已经在本月4日开始生产。
    这个厂目前主要轧制直径为六公分到九公分的钢材，年产量为六千到一万吨。这种钢材可以供大型建筑物作钢筋用，也可以用来制造打稻机的钉齿、各种螺丝、元钉和五金零件等。该厂今后还将继续新建开坯、压延两个车间，生产扁钢和制造农具的钢材。这个厂是5月初开始筹建的。全厂二百多工人大部分都是从服务社、理发社、缝纫社、铁器社等抽调来的，都缺轧制钢材的经验。但是他们有敢想敢做的共产主义风格。现在，这些“门外汉”都基本上掌握了轧钢技术。
    这个厂所有的设备都是利用的旧货。它是在职工们的协同钻研下修理好的。
