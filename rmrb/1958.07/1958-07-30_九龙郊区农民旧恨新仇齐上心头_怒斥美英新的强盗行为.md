Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 29th. Farmers in the Kowloon suburbs are angrily protesting the aggressive actions of U.S. and British imperialism, demanding that the U.S. and British invading forces immediately withdraw from the Middle East.

On July 22nd, over 200 farmers from Kwai Chung Village in the Tsuen Wan District held a meeting. These farmers, who suffered harm from U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents during the Kowloon riots in 1956, were extremely indignant about the new acts of aggression by U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East. Farmers who spoke at the meeting strongly condemned the U.S. and British imperialists who invaded the Middle East as enemies of world peace and the people. After the meeting, more than two hundred farmers signed their names, resolutely demanding that the U.S. and Britain immediately withdraw their troops invading the Middle East.

On July 27th, all the villagers of Chijing Village at the eastern end of the Kowloon Peninsula collectively signed a letter to the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po," protesting the armed aggression of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East and expressing their firm support for the people of the Middle East in opposing the aggressive war launched by U.S. and British imperialism.

In the past ten days, farmers in the Tai Po, Fanling, Kowloon City, Chuk Yuen Village, Sai Kung, Tsuen Wan, and Yuen Long areas of the Kowloon suburbs have also held various gatherings to protest the armed intervention of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East.
