Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Zhuofei reports: This year's grassroots elections have successfully concluded. The 85,045 units that conducted grassroots elections have elected approximately 4.5 million people's representatives at the township, town, and other grassroots levels. From beginning to end, this year's grassroots election work has achieved significant results due to the earnest implementation of the mass line, the deep mobilization of the masses, and the full promotion of democracy.

　　This year, the voters, in the spirit of rectification, used the methods of big contending, big blooming, and big-character posters to nominate and identify representative candidates, achieving repeated comparisons, "comparing fragrance in the garden of a hundred flowers, choosing the best among good people." Their central requirements were: "Elect whoever is most resolute in taking the socialist road," and "This year is a great leap in production, we must elect promotion faction members, not regression faction members." Therefore, when identifying representative candidates in various regions, a vigorous mass comparison movement was formed, comparing political command, leap forward, drive, and the spirit of exploration. Wang Fuying, a people's representative of the previous term from Yihe Township, Yi'ren Electoral District, Huaining County, Anhui Province, was not nominated as a representative candidate this time because of his poor acceptance of advanced technology and his failure to complete the double-cropping rice task last year. Voters criticized him for having right-leaning conservative thoughts. Instead, Wang Wang, who actively produced, was nominated as a representative candidate. In the Wudian Electoral District of Wu Zhuang Township, Xiao County, most voters nominated Jin Mingxia, a female model feeder, as a representative candidate, but a very small number of people said that she had reported the team's concealment of production and private distribution to the large commune last year, saying that she was "bending her arm outwards." This incident triggered a debate. In the end, everyone unanimously agreed that what she did last year was correct, and it was precisely her advantage, so she was nominated as a representative candidate. This kind of comparison movement fully embodies the democratic nature of our country's election system, making the work of identifying representative candidates very successful. The election results show that the representative candidates determined according to the opinions of the majority of voters have all been elected. They have won the support of the vast majority of voters, and the number of votes they obtained is generally more than 90% of the total number of votes, and some even received 100% of the votes.

　　Among the people's representatives elected this year, a considerable part are outstanding figures who have newly emerged. According to the statistics of 4,527 grassroots units, more than 43% of the people's representatives elected this year are newly elected. Among them are outstanding agricultural cooperative chairmen, activists in the socialist great debate, technical innovators in the great leap in production, and model workers. The participation of these outstanding figures in the grassroots government has added new strength to the grassroots government, enabling it to better serve the economy and the great leap in production.

　　This year, when reviewing the qualifications of voters, the masses were also deeply mobilized. Some areas used the gap time in production to organize the masses to look at the lists, and then conduct in-depth discussions. Some areas set up suggestion boxes to widely solicit opinions from the masses. In Ximenli Street, Chengxiang District, Tianjin, many electoral districts, the street activists conscientiously and responsibly participated in repeated reviews and verifications before and after the announcement of the voter list. Yang Jiaju, a resident of this street, concealed his landlord status in the past two elections and stole the right to vote. This year, thanks to the in-depth investigation and exposure by street activists, the false face of this landlord element was finally exposed. Because all localities mobilized the masses, some landlord class elements and counter-revolutionary elements who concealed their composition, pretended to be active, and attempted to steal the right to vote were exposed. This more forcefully struck at the enemies of socialism and further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship.

　　When convening the meetings of the people's representatives of grassroots units, various localities also adopted the democratic forms of big-character posters, big contending and big blooming to mobilize the masses to examine government work and the work style of cadres. Some areas have had new creations in holding people's representative assembly meetings. For example, before the meeting is over, the representatives are allowed to take the issues discussed at the meeting back to their original electoral districts to discuss with the masses, and then come back to hold the assembly to discuss the opinions of the masses and pass resolutions. After the meeting, the representatives also became propagandists, deeply publicizing the resolutions of the meeting and mobilizing the masses to earnestly implement them. This method of holding meetings, coming from the masses and going to the masses, has made the resolutions of the meeting quickly become the actions of the masses.

　　From the beginning to the end of the election is a process of mobilizing the masses and also a process of educating the masses. Therefore, the election work has powerfully promoted the great leap in production. Many areas have set off a wave of production in order to welcome the election. Some areas have achieved 100% of voters receiving propaganda and education on the great leap in production and elections, 100% of voters participating in the election, and 100% of the labor force attending work. Some areas have greatly improved labor attendance and production efficiency during the election process, and production has risen sharply. In Fengyi Township, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, the political enthusiasm of voters continued to increase during the election process, and the attendance rate also continued to increase. Before the election, the number of people attending work was 17,100, and by the end of the election, the number of people attending work had increased to 27,090; before the election, 430,000 dan of river mud was dug daily to accumulate fertilizer, and by the end of the election, 2.5 million dan were dug daily.

    今年全国基层选举胜利结束
    大批促进派当选人民代表
    据新华社3日讯　新华社记者王濯非报道：今年基层选举已胜利结束。进行基层选举的八万五千零四十五个单位，共选出了约四百五十万名乡、镇等基层单位的人民代表。今年基层选举工作从开始到结束，由于认真贯彻群众路线，深入发动群众，充分发扬民主，获得了重大的成果。
    选民们今年以整风的精神，用大鸣大放大字报的方法来提名和鉴别代表候选人，做到反复评比，“百花园中比花香，好人当中挑好人”。他们的中心要求是：“谁走社会主义道路最坚决就选谁”，“今年是生产大跃进，要选促进派，不选促退派”。所以各地在鉴别代表候选人时，形成了轰轰烈烈的比政治挂帅、比跃进、比干劲、比钻劲的群众性的评比运动。安徽省怀宁县易河乡易仁选区上届人民代表王福应，因为接受先进技术差，去年没有完成双季稻任务，选民们批评他有右倾保守思想，这次没有提他为代表候选人，而另外提出积极生产的汪旺为代表候选人。萧县吴庄乡五点选区，大多数选民提女模范饲养员靳明霞为代表候选人，但是也有很少数的人说她去年向大社反映队里瞒产私分，是“胳臂向外弯”。这件事引起了一场辩论。最后大家一致认为，她去年那样做是正确的，正是她的优点，结果她被提为代表候选人。这种评比运动，充分体现了我国选举制度的民主性，使鉴别代表候选人的工作做得很出色。选举结果表明，按照多数选民的意见确定的代表候选人，已全部当选，他们得到了绝大多数选民的拥护，所得的票数一般都在投票总数的90％以上，有的得票100％。
    今年选出的人民代表中，有相当大的一部分是新涌现出来的优秀人物。据四千五百二十七个基层单位的统计，今年选出的人民代表中，有总数43％以上是新选上的。他们中有优秀的农业社社长、社会主义大辩论中的积极分子、生产大跃进中的技术革新者、劳动模范等。这些优秀人物参加到基层政权中来，使基层政权增加了新的力量，使它更好地为经济服务，为生产大跃进服务。
    今年审查选民资格时，也深入地发动了群众。有些地区利用生产空隙时间，组织群众看榜，然后深入讨论。有些地区设立意见箱，广泛地征求群众意见。天津市城厢区西门里街许多选区在公布选民名单前后，街道积极分子认真负责地参加反复审查、核对。这条街的居民杨家驹，过去两次选举时隐瞒地主身份，窃取了选举权。今年由于街道积极分子深入调查、揭发，终于揭穿了这个地主分子的假面目。由于各地发动了群众，一些隐瞒成份、伪装积极、图谋窃取选举权的地主阶级分子和反革命分子，被揭发出来了。这就更加有力地打击了社会主义的敌对分子，进一步巩固了人民民主专政。
    各地在召开基层单位的人民代表大会会议时，也采用大字报、大鸣大放的民主形式，发动群众检查政府工作和干部作风。有些地区开人民代表大会会议有了新的创造，如会议没有开完，就让代表把会上讨论的问题带回原选区去同群众一起讨论，然后再回来开大会，讨论群众意见，通过决议。开会以后，代表们又当了宣传员，深入宣传会议的决议，发动群众认真执行。这种从群众中来到群众中去的开会方法，使会议的决议很快地成为群众的行动。
    从选举开始到选举结束，是发动群众的过程，也是教育群众的过程。因此，选举工作有力地推动了生产大跃进。许多地区为了迎接选举，掀起了生产的热潮。有些地区做到了百分之百的选民受到生产大跃进和选举的宣传教育，百分之百的选民参加选举，而且做到百分之百的劳动力出勤。有些地区在选举过程中大大提高了劳动出勤率和生产效率，生产直线上升。江苏省盐城县丰义乡选民在选举过程中，政治热情不断提高，出勤率也不断提高，选举前的出勤人数是一万七千一百人，到选举结束时，出勤人数增加到了二万七千零九十人；选举前每天挖河泥积肥四十三万担，到选举结束时，每天挖到了二百五十万担。
