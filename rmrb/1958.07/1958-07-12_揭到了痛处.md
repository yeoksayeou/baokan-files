    Hit Where it Hurts
    The Soviet government lodged a strong protest with the U.S. government regarding the June 27th intrusion of a U.S. military aircraft into Soviet airspace. Initially, the U.S. government quibbled, saying that "the Soviet accusations... are without basis." However, with concrete evidence in hand, the U.S. government had to "express regret" in its reply to the Soviet government.
    U.S. aircraft have violated the airspace of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries more than once. For example, a recent Associated Press dispatch from Washington admitted that this was not the only incident of U.S. Air Force aircraft intruding into the airspace of socialist countries. Then, it raised a question that was quite telling: Why have the communists intercepted so many U.S. aircraft in the past eight years, while not a single Soviet aircraft has been caught in areas under U.S. jurisdiction?
    The Associated Press reporter dared not answer this question, because it hit America where it hurts. It turns out that the U.S. Air Force has been a habitual thief, intruding into the airspace of other countries, especially socialist countries.

    揭到了痛处
    苏联政府曾就6月27日一架美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空一事向美国政府提出坚决的抗议。起初，美国政府还狡辩说什么“苏联的指责……是没有根据的”。但是，在真赃实据都被苏联抓住的情况下，美国政府又不得不在致苏联政府的复照中“表示遗憾”。
    美国飞机侵犯苏联和其他社会主义国家的领空，不止这一次，例如，美联社记者最近从华盛顿发出的一条消息就承认，这不是美国空军飞机侵入社会主义国家领空的唯一事件。接着，他还提出了一个颇能说明问题的问题：为什么在最近八年内共产党人截获了好多架美国飞机，而在美国管辖的地区却连一架苏联飞机也没有抓到过？
    美联社记者没有敢回答这个问题，因为这正揭到了美国的痛处，那就是美国空军原来是侵犯他国领空特别是社会主义国家的领空的惯贼了。
