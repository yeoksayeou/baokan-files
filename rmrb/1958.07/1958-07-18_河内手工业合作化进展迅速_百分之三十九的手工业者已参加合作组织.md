    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th: The socialist transformation of handicrafts in Hanoi has made great progress in the past six months. 39% of Hanoi's handicraft workers have joined eighteen production cooperatives, two hundred and fifty-five collective production groups, and more than six hundred production teams. Three-quarters of these production units have accepted processing, ordering, and sales tasks and contracts from state-owned trading companies.

    After joining the production cooperatives, scattered handicraft workers expanded their production equipment and increased the variety of products. After the organization of the textile industry production cooperative, there was sufficient capital to purchase hundreds of looms, and the quality of newly produced gingham and lawn, etc., was improved compared to the past. After the implementation of cooperativization, the cost of aluminum products produced by some handicraft production cooperatives was reduced by 20% to 40%, and the product quality was also improved.

    河内手工业合作化进展迅速
    百分之三十九的手工业者已参加合作组织
    据新华社河内17日电　河内手工业的社会主义改造在最近半年有很大的进展。河内的手工业者已经有39％分别参加了十八个生产合作社、二百五十五个集体生产联组和六百多个生产小组；这些生产单位中已经有四分之三接受了国营贸易公司的加工、订货和包销的任务和合同。
    分散经营的手工业者在参加了生产合作社以后，扩大了生产设备，增加了产品的品种。纺织业生产合作社组织起来以后，有了足够的资金来购置几百台织布机，新出产的格布和柳条细布等的质量都比过去提高。实行合作化以后，一些手工业生产合作社生产的铝制品的成本降低了20％到40％，产品质量也提高了。
