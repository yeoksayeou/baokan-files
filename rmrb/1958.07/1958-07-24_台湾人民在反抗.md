The following is a translation of a New China News Agency report:

According to Taiwanese newspapers, the increasingly strong resistance of the Taiwanese people is causing the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique great trouble.

In order to maintain the tottering Chiang family dynasty, the U.S. and Chiang have adopted increasingly terrifying and brutal means of rule in Taiwan. Recently, the Chiang Kai-shek clique announced the merger of military and police agencies suppressing the Taiwanese people, formally establishing the "Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters," placing the past four different systems of military and police units under unified command; at the same time, several thousand more police officers have been added to various counties and cities. In addition to distributing special agents and secret police from 755 "security offices" to every corner of Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is now planning to establish another 289 "security offices" in grassroots units such as government agencies, schools, social organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises. According to Chang Chiu-ju, a "legislator" of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, in the past few years, out of the 311,300 so-called "subversion" cases that have occurred in Taiwan, the U.S.-Chiang authorities have arrested more than 1.3 million people. With a total population of over 9 million in Taiwan, an average of more than one in ten people has been persecuted.

Many facts show that the struggle between the Taiwanese people and the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is becoming increasingly fierce. Several residents in the Keelung area, hating the Chiang army's seizure of large tracts of farmland for military use, used homemade landmines to destroy a military vehicle, killing the officers and soldiers on board. In Taiwan, Chiang family special agents, police, and sentries are often found beaten to death with iron bars and stones. Explosives are sometimes thrown into the residences of U.S.-Chiang personnel. In Hsinfeng Township, Hsinchu County, a Kuomintang armed special agent named Li once ran rampant and committed all kinds of evil, but was killed by angry local residents with kitchen knives. Not long ago, the incident in which Chiang family special agents killed Zhang Chengkui, a resident of Shandong origin in Taipei City, also aroused great anger among the vast number of citizens in Taipei City. More than 1,000 citizens gathered and marched under the guns and bayonets of military police, and issued mimeographed protest letters. In many places in Taiwan, such slogans and leaflets often appear: "Oppose the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous regime, U.S. aggressors get out of Taiwan, we are determined to fight for survival, national independence, and to return Taiwan to the motherland."

The struggle between the Taiwanese people and the U.S. aggressors is also continuous. Since the "May 24" anti-U.S. demonstration last year, dozens of anti-U.S. incidents have occurred in Taiwan, including Taiwanese people beating up U.S. soldiers, opposing U.S. military construction in Taiwan, and opposing the U.S. strangling of Taiwan's economy. In late October last year, more than 1,000 workers at the Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation, which was "annexed" by U.S. monopoly capital, went on strike due to dissatisfaction with U.S. plunder and abuse. Not long ago, in Tainan, Taichung, and other places, the U.S. military, in order to build airports and expand restricted areas, forced many Taiwanese residents to demolish their houses and give up their land, which was strongly resisted by local residents.

According to Chiang army personnel who have returned after defecting from Taiwan: In the Chiang army units, collective disturbances and anti-U.S. demonstrations also occur constantly. At the Chiang army naval non-commissioned officer school in Anping Harbor, Tainan, dozens of students planned a riot. They planned to kill U.S. advisors, Chiang army officers, seize weapons, and escape to Alishan to wage guerrilla warfare. Unfortunately, the incident was exposed. On the night before the planned riot, they were collectively subjected to bloody suppression. About 250 officers and soldiers are arrested by secret police every month and sent to concentration camps and prisons.

The growing anti-U.S. and anti-Chiang sentiment in the Chiang army units has caused Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. advisors great headaches. The "brilliant plan" of the U.S. generals is to send Americans to serve as officers in all Chiang army units, with U.S. instructors directly responsible for the training of the troops, so that the U.S. can establish a network of special agents in the Chiang army units. But many Chiang army officers and soldiers ridiculed these measures, saying: It would be much easier for the United States to put us all in an iron cage.

    台湾人民在反抗
    丁固
    据台湾报刊透露，台湾人民日益强烈的反抗，使美帝国主义和蒋介石集团烦恼重重。
    为了维持摇摇欲坠的蒋氏小王朝，美蒋在台湾采取了越来越恐怖、越来越残暴的统治手段。最近，蒋介石集团宣布合并镇压台湾人民的军警机构，正式成立“台湾警备总司令部”，把过去四个不同系统的军警单位置于统一指挥之下；同时各县市又增加了数千名警察。蒋介石集团除了把七百五十五个“安全室”的特务、秘密警察分布到台湾每一个角落以外，目前又要在各机关、学校、社会团体、工矿等基层单位，再设立二百八十九个“安全室”的特务机构。据台湾国民党“立法委员”张九如透露，在最近几年来，台湾发生的三十一万一千三百多件所谓“颠复”案中，美蒋当局共逮捕了一百三十多万人，台湾共九百多万人口，平均十个人中就有一个多人遭到迫害。
    许多事实表明，台湾人民和美帝国主义和蒋介石集团之间的斗争日趋激烈。基隆地区的几个居民因为憎恨蒋军强占大片谷田作军事用地，用土造地雷击毁了一辆军用汽车，炸死了上面的军官和士兵。在台湾也常常发现蒋家特务、警察和哨兵被人用铁棍和石块打死。美蒋人员的住宅内，有时也被投进了爆炸物。在新竹县新丰乡，有个姓李的国民党武装特务曾横行一时无恶不作，被当地愤怒的居民用菜刀杀死。不久以前，蒋家特务害死台北市山东籍居民张成奎的事件，也引起了台北市广大市民的极大愤怒，一千多市民在宪兵的枪口和刺刀下集会游行，并且发出油印的抗议书。在台湾不少地方还常常出现了这样的标语传单：“反对蒋介石卖国政权，美国侵略者滚出台湾去，我们坚决要为争取生存、民族独立和使台湾重新归到祖国而斗争。”
    台湾人民同美国侵略者的斗争也接连不断。从去年“五·二四”反美大示威以来，台湾又发生了几十起反美事件，其中包括台湾人民痛打美军、反对美国在台湾建筑军事工程、反对美国扼杀台湾经济。去年10月下旬，被美国垄断资本“吞并”的殷加尔斯台湾造船公司，有一千多工人由于不满美国的掠夺和虐待而举行了罢工。不久以前，在台南、台中等地，美军由于要建造飞机场和扩大禁区，强迫许多地方的台湾居民拆迁房屋和让出田地，受到当地居民的强烈反抗。
    据从台湾起义归来的蒋军人员谈：在蒋军部队中，也不断发生过集体骚动和反美示威。在台南安平港的蒋军海军士官学校中，有几十名学员酝酿过一次暴动，他们准备杀了美国顾问、蒋军军官、夺下武器，逃上阿里山去打游击。不幸事件败露，在预定暴动的前一天晚上，他们集体遭到血腥镇压。每月约有二百五十名官兵被秘密警察逮捕，押进集中营和监狱。
    蒋军部队中反美反蒋情绪的不断增长，使蒋介石和美国顾问大伤脑筋。美国将军们的“妙计”是：要在蒋军所有部队中派美国人担任军官，由美国教官直接负责部队的训练，以便美国在蒋军部队中建立一套特务网。但是许多蒋军官兵在议论这些措施时都嘲笑说：美国如果用一个铁笼能把我们都关进去，就要比这便当得多。　（新华社）
