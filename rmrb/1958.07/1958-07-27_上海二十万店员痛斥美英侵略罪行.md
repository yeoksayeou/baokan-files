Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 26th: Shanghai's 200,000 shop assistants have been holding rallies in recent days, vehemently denouncing the towering crimes of U.S. and British imperialism in their aggression against the Middle East, and are determined to fully support the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle.

At these rallies, many elderly shop assistants used their decades of experience in fighting imperialism to illustrate that victory will surely belong to the people. Huang Wanfeng, a shop assistant at Wing On Company who participated in the Shanghai workers' three armed uprisings, said: Back then, the British invaders set up machine guns aimed at the gate of our dormitory, but we didn't care and still carried out parades and demonstrations. Later, we were beaten by British patrolmen and attacked by water cannons. Although the invaders were so tyrannical, we eventually won. The shop assistants at "Lao Jiefu" silk and cloth store witnessed the barbaric behavior of the invaders in Shanghai. They said: The invaders seemed to be awe-inspiring at that time, but they were still driven out by the Chinese people. Now the invaders are declining, and the people of the Middle East have the support of the powerful world peace forces. Victory will surely belong to the Arab people. Many shop assistants vividly remember the "Quangong Building Massacre" during the Shanghai shop assistants' anti-American movement on February 9, 1947. Many people were beaten by American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in this massacre. Liang Renda, a shop assistant at Wing On Company, was killed that day. Now, when people think of the martyrs' blood and see the scars on their bodies, they are particularly sympathetic to the Arab people today, and they have expressed their determination to do everything possible to support the just struggle of the Arab people.

Tens of thousands of Shanghai shop assistants have written protests against U.S.-British aggression. All the employees of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Trust Company's second-hand store wrote in a protest letter: The U.S.-British imperialists' aggression against the Middle East is a blatant provocation to the people of the world; the people of the world stand on the side of justice, and if the invaders do not pull back from the brink, they will surely suffer the consequences.

Now, slogans written by shop assistants can be seen everywhere in Shanghai's large and small stores: "Yankee go home from Lebanon!" "British troops get out of Jordan!"

    上海二十万店员痛斥美英侵略罪行
    新华社上海26日电　上海二十万店员连日举行集会，痛斥美英帝国主义侵略中东的滔天罪行，决心全力支援阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。
    在这些集会上，许多老年店员用自己几十年来同帝国主义斗争的经验，说明胜利一定属于人民。参加过上海工人三次武装起义的永安公司店员黄万丰说：想当年，英国侵略者架起机关枪对准我们宿舍的大门，我们却毫不在乎，仍然进行游行示威，后来又遭到英国巡捕的毒打，受到水龙头的冲击，尽管侵略者如此强横，最后我们还是胜利了。“老介福”绸布店的店员们目击过侵略者在上海的野蛮行为，他们说：侵略者那时好像是威风凛凛，结果还是给中国人民赶出去了；现在侵略者已经日落西山，中东人民又有强大的世界和平力量的支持，胜利一定属于阿拉伯人民。许多店员对1947年2月9日上海店员反美运动中的“劝工大楼惨案”都记忆犹新，许多人在这个惨案中受过美蒋特务的殴打，永安公司店员梁仁达还在那天被打死。现在人们想起烈士的鲜血，看到自己身上的创痕，都格外同情今天的阿拉伯人民，纷纷表示尽一切力量支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    成千成万的上海店员都写了反对美英侵略的抗议书。上海市贸易信托公司旧货商店的全体职工在一份抗议书中写道：美英帝国主义对中东的侵略，是对全世界人民狂妄的挑衅；全世界人民站在正义的一边，侵略者如不悬崖勒马，定将自食其果。
    现在，上海的大小商店内到处都可以看到店员们写的标语：“美军滚出黎巴嫩！”“英军滚出约旦！”
