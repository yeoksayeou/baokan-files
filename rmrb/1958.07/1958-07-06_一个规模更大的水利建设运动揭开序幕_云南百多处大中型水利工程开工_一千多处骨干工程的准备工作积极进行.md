Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 5th - An even larger water conservancy construction movement than last winter and this spring has begun in Yunnan. More than 120 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects have already started. In the Erhai Lake Water Diversion and Irrigation Project, which started on June 15th, thousands of workers are concentrated, battling day and night with the rocky mountains. They need to excavate three tunnels with a total length of more than 13 kilometers to make the water of Erhai Lake pass through the mountain rocks and flow into the 470,000 mu of fields in Binchuan, Dengchuan counties and Weishan Yi Autonomous County. People of all ethnic groups in Tengchong County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, are building a 400 li long canal, they want to divert the water of the Longchuan River, a tributary of the Irrawaddy River, over Gaoligong Mountain into 120,000 mu of arid fields.

    At the same time, more than 1,000 surveyors have been dispatched to various places to ensure that all canals to be started this year are surveyed during the rainy season. Designers must also complete the design of 900 water conservancy projects before September. Hundreds of factories in the province are rushing to manufacture gate valves, cement, steel, and other tools and equipment. A constant stream of cars runs on the plateau, transporting various equipment and materials to the construction site. Materials for more than 1,500 large and medium-sized backbone projects must be prepared and the foundations cleared before September.

    In view of the late start and passive work in water conservancy construction last year, Yunnan Province began planning next year's water conservancy construction projects from April this year. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee has summarized the "six combinations" water management experience suitable for the Yunnan Plateau from the past few years of fighting drought: Combining unified planning with gradual construction; combining large, medium, and small-sized projects, with medium-sized projects as the main focus; combining permanent projects with temporary projects, with permanent projects as the main focus; combining groundwater with surface water, with surface water as the main focus; combining gravity irrigation with water lifting irrigation, with gravity irrigation as the main focus; combining major spring irrigation with minor spring irrigation, with major spring water use as the main focus. According to this experience, various places have adopted the method of leadership taking the lead, combined with technicians and the masses, and planned layer by layer according to river basins and regions. While planning, they reviewed and decided on the spot, carried out project scheduling, and gradually constructed.

    The province will contribute 1 billion workdays and complete 1.4 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work by next year, doubling the amount of work completed this year, which can store 12.5 billion cubic meters of water and increase the irrigated area by 18 million mu. Since the province is mostly mountainous, with high mountains and steep slopes, it is suitable for building high dams to store deep water, or opening long canals to divert water for irrigation. Therefore, it is planned to focus on building medium-sized projects with an irrigation area of more than 10,000 mu. By next year, the province will build 1,500 medium-sized water conservancy projects, combined with building 23 large-scale projects with an irrigation area of more than 50,000 mu. These projects are generally more arduous. For example, Huarong County plans to build a high mountain reservoir with a dam height of 80 meters, which is nearly twice as high as the famous Thirteen Tombs Reservoir, and will be the highest earth dam in the country. Many canals need to cross high mountains, requiring the excavation of hundred-foot-tall cliffs.

    In the long years before liberation, Yunnan had only 4.43 million mu of paddy fields and irrigated land, accounting for only a little more than one-tenth of the province's cultivated land area. The water conservancy projects built in the nine years after liberation can increase the irrigated area by more than 19 million mu, of which 12 million mu were completed during the upsurge of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. After the completion of next year's water conservancy construction project, more than 90% of the province's cultivated land can obtain an average of 400 to 1,000 cubic meters of water per mu for irrigation, which can eliminate ordinary drought and flood disasters and ensure a good harvest even if it does not rain for a year.

### 一个规模更大的水利建设运动揭开序幕  云南百多处大中型水利工程开工  一千多处骨干工程的准备工作积极进行

    一个规模更大的水利建设运动揭开序幕
    云南百多处大中型水利工程开工
    一千多处骨干工程的准备工作积极进行
    新华社昆明5日电　一个比去冬今春规模更大的水利建设运动在云南揭开序幕。有一百二十多处大、中型水利工程已经开工。在6月15日开工的洱海引水灌溉工程，集中了几千民工日夜同石岩搏斗，他们要开凿三条共长十三公里多的隧道，使洱海的水钻过山岩，流入宾川、邓川两县和巍山彝族自治县的四十七万亩田地。德宏傣族景颇族自治州腾冲县的各族人民正在修筑一条四百华里长的水渠，他们要把伊洛瓦底江支流龙川江的水翻过高黎贡山，引入十二万亩干涸的田地。
    与此同时，一千多名测量人员已分赴各地，他们保证在雨季中把今年要开工的水渠全部测量好。设计人员在9月以前，也要完成九百个水利工程的设计，省内成百上千的工厂正在赶制闸门、水泥、钢材及其它工具设备。川流不息的汽车奔驰在高原上，将各种器材设备运到工地。一千五百多处大、中型骨干工程都要在9月以前准备好材料，清理好基础。
    鉴于去年水利建设动工迟，工作被动，今年云南省从4月份起就开始规划明年的水利建设工程。中共云南省委从几年来与干旱作斗争中总结出了适合云南高原特点的“六结合”的治水经验，即：统一规划与逐步施工相结合；大、中、小型相结合，以中型为主；永久性工程与临时性工程相结合，以永久性工程为主；地下水与地上水相结合，以地上水为主；自流灌溉与提水灌溉相结合，以自流灌溉为主；大春灌溉与小春灌溉相结合，以大春用水为主。各地根据这一经验，采取了领导挂帅，与技术员、群众三结合的办法，按流域和地区层层规划。一面规划，一面就地审核决定，进行工程排队，逐步施工。
    全省到明年将出工十亿个，完成十四亿土石方工程，比今年已完成的工程量增加一倍，可蓄水一百二十五亿方，增加灌溉面积一千八百万亩。由于全省多山，山高坡陡，适合筑高坝以蓄深水，或开长渠引水灌溉，因此计划以兴修灌溉一万亩以上的中型工程为主，到明年全省将修中型水利一千五百处，并结合兴办二十三处灌溉五万亩以上的大型工程。这些工程一般都比较艰巨，如华宁县计划修建一座高山水库，坝高八十公尺，比著名的十三陵水库的坝还高出近两倍，将是目前全国最高的土坝，不少水渠要翻过重重高山，需凿通百丈陡岩。
    解放前的漫长年代里，云南只有四百四十三万亩水田和水浇地，仅占全省耕地面积的十分之一强。解放后九年内兴修的水利工程，可增加灌溉面积一千九百多万亩，其中有一千二百万亩是在去冬今春水利建设高潮中完成的。明年的水利建设工程完成后，全省90％以上的耕地平均每亩分别可得四百方到一千方水的灌溉，能够消灭普通的水旱灾害，保证一年不下雨也能丰收。
