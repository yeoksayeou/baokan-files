    Indian Flagship "Mysore"
    The cruiser "Mysore", led by Rear Admiral Chakravarti, Commander of the Indian Fleet, is the flagship of the Indian Navy. The captain is Colonel Nanda. This cruiser was originally named "Nigeria" and was purchased by the Indian government from the United Kingdom in September 1954. Before being handed over to the Indian Navy, it was sent to Birkenhead for repairs and became a modern warship. It was officially handed over to India in December 1957 and named after the capital of Mysore State.
    After India's independence in 1947, the Indian government began to build a modern navy to defend its territory and territorial waters, which have a long coastline. At the end of 1947, according to the Anglo-Indian agreement, India acquired its first cruiser, the "Delhi", of more than 7,000 tons. In 1950, three destroyers purchased by India from the United Kingdom arrived in Bombay, and the first destroyer flotilla was established. Soon, a fast fleet and a minesweeper squadron were also established. Later, three more destroyers for training were purchased from the United Kingdom. At the same time, two of the latest fast ships were added. Recently, an aircraft carrier of 15,700 tons has been obtained, and is being modernized and equipped. It is expected to be in service within three years.
    In order to fully "Indianize" the navy, India has actively trained its own naval personnel since independence. This work has also achieved remarkable results. At present, except for two or three technical positions, all command and other positions in the navy are held by Indian officers.
    The participation of the cruiser "Mysore" in the Indian Navy has strengthened India's naval power. The flagship "Mysore" has a displacement of 8,700 tons, a length of 549 feet, and a beam of 62 feet. It has nine 6-inch guns, placed in three turrets. The ship has modern radar and electronic equipment, as well as electric kitchens, ventilation equipment, and entertainment facilities for the more than 800 officers and men on board.
    In order to promote friendly cooperation between countries, Indian naval ships have visited twenty-five countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe in the past ten years.

    印度“迈索尔”号旗舰
    由印度舰队司令查克洛伐蒂海军少将率领来我国访问的“迈索尔”号巡洋舰，是印度海军的旗舰。舰长是南达上校。这艘巡洋舰原名“奈几里亚”号，是印度政府于1954年9月向英国买的。在转交印度海军之前，它被送到柏肯海德去修理，成为一艘现代化军舰。1957年12月正式移交给印度，以迈索尔邦的省会名字命名。
    1947年印度独立后，为了捍卫拥有长海岸线的领土和领海，印度政府开始建设一支现代化的海军。1947年底，根据英印协议，印度获得了第一艘巡洋舰——七千多吨的“德里”号。1950年，印度向英国购买的三艘驱逐舰开抵孟买，第一支驱逐舰队于是成立了。不久，又成立了一支快速舰队和一支扫雷艇队。后来又向英国购买了三艘供训练用的驱逐舰。同时增加了两艘最新式的快速舰。最近，又得到一艘一万五千七百吨的航空母舰，正在进行现代化的装备，预计三年内可以服役。
    为了使海军全部“印度化”，独立后，印度积极地训练本国的海军人员。这项工作也获得了显著的成绩。目前，除了两三个技术岗位外，海军中全部的指挥和其他职位都由印度军官担任了。
    “迈索尔”号巡洋舰的参加印度海军，加强了印度的海军力量。“迈索尔”号旗舰排水量八千七百吨，长五百四十九呎，船幅六十二呎。它有九个六吋炮。分置在三座炮塔上，舰上有现代化的雷达和电子装置，还有电气厨房、通风设备，以及供全舰八百多名官兵娱乐的设施。
    为了促进各国友好合作，印度海军舰只十年来曾经到亚非和欧洲的二十五个国家进行访问。
