Title: Robbers Preaching

After the U.S.-Canada economic talks ended without results, Britain's "Manchester Guardian" discussed some of Eisenhower's speeches during his visit to Canada in a complaining tone. The newspaper said that the President "repeatedly stated that Canada should in fact be grateful for the measures and investments of the United States, which is simply rubbing salt into the wound."

Indeed, the "Manchester Guardian's" accusation of this foolish behavior by the U.S. President is not without reason. The frantic plunder of Canada by U.S. monopoly capital has long been opposed by Canadians, and recently the U.S. government's restrictions on Canadian oil imports and its low-price dumping of "surplus" wheat abroad have repeatedly caused significant losses to Canada's foreign trade; at this time, it would be extremely foolish to ask Canadians to "be grateful for the measures and investments of the United States."

However, while complaining about Eisenhower's "unwise" behavior, this newspaper seems to have deliberately forgotten two things: (1) In the mind of the U.S. President, Canada was originally a U.S. colony; (2) Washington has always promoted U.S. foreign investment as a "gift" to backward countries. Starting from this kind of robber logic, is it strange that the U.S. President wants Canadians to be grateful for the plundering behavior of the United States?

Therefore, rather than saying that the U.S. President is "rubbing salt into the wound," it is better to say that the robber is preaching.

    强盗在说教
    在美加经济会谈以无结果告终以后，英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”以埋怨的口吻谈论了艾森豪威尔访问加拿大时的一些讲话。这家报纸说，总统“几次表示加拿大应当事实上感激美国的措施和投资，这不过是在伤口里擦盐”。
    的确，“曼彻斯特卫报”对美国总统的这种愚蠢行为的指责不是没有道理的。美国大垄断资本对加拿大的疯狂掠夺多年来早已为加拿大人所反对，而最近美国政府限制加拿大石油进口，并在国外低价倾销“剩余”小麦又使加拿大对外贸易一再遭受重大损失；在这种时候，要加拿大人来“感激美国的措施和投资”岂不十分愚蠢。
    不过这家报纸在埋怨艾森豪威尔的这种“不智”行为的时候，似乎有意忘记了两件事：（一）在美国总统心目中，加拿大原就是美国的一块殖民地；（二）华盛顿一向就把美国的对外投资宣传是对落后国家的一种“恩赐”。从这种强盗式的逻辑出发，那么美国总统要加拿大人来感激美国的掠夺行为，这又有什么奇怪呢？
    因此，与其说美国总统是“在伤口里擦盐”，倒不如说是强盗在说教。
