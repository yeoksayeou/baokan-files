Record of a “Conservative” Surrendering

By our correspondent Zhang Lizhong

Editor's note: China's high wheat yield records continue to emerge, and miracles of mu (Chinese acre) yields of 3,000, 4,000, and over 5,000 jin are becoming more and more common. These facts have greatly encouraged people's enthusiasm for building socialism and have also made people further realize that the potential for agricultural production is enormous. It is entirely possible to develop China's agricultural production at a faster rate and catch up with and surpass all capitalist countries in a short period of time. However, there are still a few people who are skeptical about the high wheat yield records and do not quite believe such facts.

The communication published in this newspaper today—"Record of a 'Conservative' Surrendering"—is a very worthwhile article to read. It describes in detail the production process of a high-yield wheat experimental field and describes how two old farmers went from disbelieving that wheat could produce high yields to fully believing the fact that the mu yield was over 4,000 jin of wheat. After reading this article, who can still disbelieve the miracle of high wheat yields?

In the Zhaozhuang team of the Shuanglou Commune in Shangqiu County, Henan Province, there are two young people, one is the production team leader Yang Shenglun (a veteran and a Communist Party member), and the other is the secretary of the Youth League branch Yang Guangju. Last year, in accordance with the call of the higher-level Party committee, they decided to create a high-yield field with a yield of 800 jin per mu. The news spread and touched the "conservatives" in the village, especially Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, two old "hands" in the team. They muttered everywhere: our ancestors have been farming for three generations. Haven't learned to plow until they were as tall as the plow handle. Now we have been doing this for a lifetime, and have never heard of being able to harvest so much wheat. When the team held a meeting to discuss the high-yield plan, the two old men came out to speak. Li Xuecai said to the captain Yang Shenglun: "Shenglun, you went out to join the army when you were a teenager and only came back last year. You can't switch shoulders when threshing and can't bend your waist when hoeing. When it comes to meetings and speeches, I am not as good as you, but when it comes to farming, you are still 'away from the plow handle' (meaning an amateur), 'you have to call me big brother for the rest of your life.'" The old man Yang Shengde took over and said: "Let's go to the courtyard to hold the meeting." Everyone asked him why? He said: "Don't let us blow the roof off. Wheat has always been low-yielding. If you want 800 jin, you have to count the stalks as well." At the meeting, everyone was full of energy, but after they said this, many people lost their enthusiasm, and the meeting broke up unhappily.

Shenglun and Guangju then convened a meeting of activists from the whole team. Chen Xiurong, the women's captain who was originally in high spirits and wanted to work with Shenglun and Guangju to achieve high yields, said at the meeting: "If we can't get 800 jin, we won't be able to explain it to the masses in the future." Shenglun said: "We must achieve it. If others don't do it, our seven or eight Party members, League members, and activists can turn over one mu of land all night without sleeping. There are no difficulties that cannot be solved." Yang Guangju, who was more proficient in farming, proposed at the meeting: Deeply plow the land to a depth of one and a half chi (Chinese foot), apply basal fertilizer in layers, and densely plant 32 jin of seeds to lay a good foundation. So everyone's enthusiasm was boosted again.

Breaking with Conventions, Boldly Innovating

The season for preparing the land arrived, and they found a piece of land where autumn sorghum had been flooded. First, they used a double-share plow to deeply plow six cun (Chinese inch), and then they used hoes and iron shovels to carry out general deep plowing. They spread a layer of manure every time they plowed a layer of soil. Before sowing, they applied a total of 8,000 jin of human and pig manure, as well as 13,500 jin of grass and soil fertilizer. Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde heard that these young people were plowing the land and applying so much fertilizer, which was also breaking the conventional practice, and they argued with pursed whiskers. One said: "These young people are simply fooling around. I have been planting wheat for a lifetime and have never plowed the land!" The other said: "If a weasel could drive a cart, who would buy a mule? This must be another strange idea from Shenglun. Hey! Wait until after the wheat harvest and see if they can recover the cost of the fertilizer."

Although Shenglun and Guangju had repeatedly run into many snags in front of these two "old conservatives," Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde were the best farmers in the team. To achieve a good harvest, they had to learn from people with skills. When sowing, they personally called them to the field and worked with them to study how to plant high-yield wheat well. As soon as the two old men, Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, arrived in the field, without saying a word, they asked: "How many seeds are you going to sow per mu?" Yang Shenglun replied: "Thirty-two jin." Li Xuecai snorted from his nose, turned his head and left. After walking a few steps, he turned back and asked Yang Shenglun: "In the past, we usually sowed eight jin per mu, and at most twelve jin. In our village, which is third-class land, we only harvested thirty or forty jin per mu. Will the wheat harvested in the future be enough to cover the cost?" Yang Shengde added fuel to the fire and said: "You know how big the drill hole is. Even if you open all the drill holes, you won't be able to sow all thirty-two jin of seeds." Shenglun said: "Dense planting is a high-yield experience from other places." The two old men were even more annoyed when they heard this, and said: "Good! You go and rely on these foreign ideas!" After saying that, they left in a huff. At that time, Yang Guangju and Yang Shenglun were both angry and annoyed. They vowed on the spot that no matter what, they would make a good showing for those "old conservatives" to see. Because it was impossible to sow 32 jin of seeds per mu with the old drill, they studied how to first sow 15 jin of seeds by hand, and then use the drill to sow the remaining seeds. When sowing, Yang Guangju said: "This is really a bold creation. I have never even seen it before." Shenglun said: "Let's do it. If we plant it well, we will have experience. If we plant it badly, we will have lessons. Anyway, we will find a way to achieve high yields for the land." In this way, except for the ridges, the field was full of wheat. After planting, they irrigated it again, and the wheat seedlings grew out black and green.

Overcoming the Lodging Problem

By the time of the Qingming Festival, the wheat had already covered the ground, and the wheat leaves were black and oily like leeks. Once, Yang Shenglun sent the two old men, Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, to pull manure into this high-yield field (the two old men were in charge of using livestock) to apply the fourth topdressing. They calculated that this piece of land had already been applied with three basal fertilizers and three topdressings, including human manure, "ammonium sulfate," granular fertilizer, grass fertilizer, and topsoil, totaling no less than 50,000 jin. Li Xuecai said: "These young people are going crazy. They really don't know how to farm. If they do this, it will inevitably lodge!" Originally, in 1951, there was a Yang Guangxun in this village who planted a piece of wheat in a five-fen vegetable garden and applied a lot of fertilizer. The wheat grew so densely that no soil was exposed, which was particularly pleasing. At that time, experienced old farmers estimated that it could harvest a thousand jin, but who would have thought that it would lodge later and only harvest 250 jin. This incident left the villagers with the conclusion that "wheat cannot be dense, and if it is dense, it will lodge." Yang Shengde and Li Xuecai desperately used this example to attack the high-yield field planted by Yang Guangju, Yang Shenglun, and others, saying that dense planting and applying a lot of fertilizer would simply not grow.

In order to prevent lodging, Yang Shenglun and Yang Guangju also used their brains. They ran to the agricultural technology station to find technical cadres for help. The agricultural technical cadres told them: According to agricultural science theory, the land is deeply ploughed, and the wheat roots are deeply rooted, which can prevent lodging to a certain extent; if some wood ash is applied, it can strengthen the stalk, which is even more insurance. Since then, they have collected wood ash from door to door every day, and collected more than 1,000 jin when the wheat was about to head. Shenglun asked Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde to drive the cart to pull the ash to the field. This time, the two old men were extremely annoyed! Yang Shengde pursed his mustache and said: "Hum! Just finished the fourth topdressing, and now we are applying wood ash again! The wheat seedlings are only more than two chi high, and they are so dense that there is no place to put your feet. I am sure it will lodge." Li Xuecai was angry in his stomach and came up with a bad idea: 1,000 jin of wood ash, it is clear that two animals are enough to pull it, but he insisted on using four. Yang Shengde asked him what he was doing, and he said angrily: "We said we can't apply any more fertilizer. Drive these four animals to the field and turn around, and stomp the wheat to death, you grandson!" Although he said that, when they drove the cart to the edge of the field and saw the neatly growing wheat seedlings, they really couldn't bear to do such a cruel thing. Yang Shenglun, who was standing on the edge of the field, saw them pulling the ash and immediately greeted them to unload the ash on the edge of the field, let them sit down and rest, and sent a few women to take off their shoes, carefully open the wheat stalks, and carry baskets to spread the ash in the field. The two old men sat on the edge of the field and watched coldly. But seeing that in an instant, the hair, eyebrows, and clothes of those women were covered with the flying ash, they were simply turned into ash people. They felt both angry and funny in their hearts and sighed in unison: "Alas! It's really a sin!" They lowered their heads and drove the cart back to the village.

"Conservatives" Begin to Waver

The wheat was about to head. One day, Shengde and Xuecai finished their work in the livestock house and came to this high-yield field with their tobacco pipes again. After walking around twice, the old man Li Xuecai spoke: "I have been farming for a lifetime and have never seen such good wheat seedlings, but they are too dense! According to past experience, at least three out of ten plants will not be able to produce ears. Even if the remaining ones produce ears, they will only be as big as fly heads." The old man Shengde said sarcastically: "Can the wheat planted by the cadres dare not produce ears!" Half a month later, the wheat had fully headed. Xuecai and Shengde came to the high-yield field again to see the wheat. They were greatly surprised to see the dense layer of thick and large wheat ears covering the top. Li Xuecai didn't say a word, and opened the wheat furrow with his hand. He looked for it for a long time, and it was really strange, he couldn't find a single discarded ear. He smacked his mouth and walked back and forth several times, muttering to himself: "Strange! It really has grown miraculously." The old man Shengde said carelessly: "In the past, we planted wheat on good fallow land, and we only harvested 200 jin at most. This time, let's give them twice as much, 400 jin at most. It's still far from 800 jin!"

The wheat is ripe! One day, Shenglun and Guangju specially invited the two old men to estimate the yield with them. When they came to the edge of the high-yield field, Li Xuecai, who was not very tall, had to raise his hand to reach the wheat heads. They could not be seen after entering the wheat field. The two old men muttered for a long time, and neither of them expressed their opinions. The cadres repeatedly urged them to talk. Xuecai said: "We have never experienced such wheat, so we can't estimate it accurately." "Let go of your thinking and estimate casually!" Li Xuecai took a long time to summon up his courage and said: "Then let's count 600 jin!" "Can't it be more?" "Let's count 800 jin!" "Can it be more?" Xuecai said: "Let's count 1,600!" Xuecai thought to himself: If you ask me to say more, I will say it can yield 5,000 jin. The more you say, the happier you will be. Anyway, the real yield I estimate is 400 jin. At this time, the cadres also went in to select "squares," count plants, count ears, count seeds, and the result of the calculation was that each mu contained more than 1.6 million plants, each ear contained forty or so seeds, and it could harvest more than 4,590 jin. On the spot, the old people such as Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde shouted in a mess. Li Xuecai said: "The cadres have big mouths, they say what they want, and they don't pay taxes for talking big. Just say it. Anyway, as long as we thresh it, we are not afraid of being exposed?"

"Supervisory Post" on the Threshing Ground

It's time to harvest the wheat in the high-yield field! Without the captain's greeting, more than twenty people came. The people who came had their own purposes. The old people participated in harvesting the wheat to see for themselves how much they could harvest? Is it as big as the cadres bragged? The young people were driven by curiosity and wanted to harvest wheat in the high-yield field. It was particularly lively to harvest wheat in an area of one mu with twenty or so people. The wheat stalks were dense and the stalks were high, making it difficult to pull them up. Twenty or so people pulled wheat from early in the morning until the sun was setting. Because the wheat grew well, the bundles of wheat were placed one after another. This piece of land could not accommodate them, so they had to be placed in other fields around it. After pulling the wheat, the two old men, Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, examined it for a long time on the edge of the field. Li Xuecai said: "This wheat looks like it can exceed 400 jin." The old man Yang Shengde picked up a bundle of wheat and weighed it, and then said: "This wheat can yield 600 jin? I don't think it can reach that. When threshing, let's take care of it and see how many jin it can yield."

In order to make the yield accurate, after pulling the wheat, the two old men personally drove the cart to transport the wheat to the threshing ground. They pulled a total of five large carts; plus the carrying of ten or so women, the wheat from this one mu of land was piled up into three large stacks. It was decided to thresh the wheat that afternoon. The old men became even more nervous when they heard that the wheat was going to be threshed. Headed by Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, there were also a group of old people such as Yang Guangxun, who stayed on the threshing ground at all times. Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde were in charge of driving the animals to pull the stone roller. Among the three large stacks of wheat, they first selected a small stack of wheat to thresh. When threshing, they often opened the wheat stalks to see how thick the wheat seeds were underneath. After one roll, when cleaning up the field, the cadres asked the old men to estimate how much they had harvested? The old men saw that only a small stack of the three stacks of wheat had been threshed, and they boldly estimated that there would be ten hu (one hu is 30 jin). After threshing the field, a measurement found that it had harvested thirty-two hu, with about a thousand jin of grain. At this time, the young people jumped up happily, but Li Xuecai, Yang Shengde, and their group squatted on the side of the field, like defeated roosters, panting there. Then they threshed the second and third fields overnight. At this time, they had been working for a whole night, and the two old men persisted until the end. After threshing the whole field and weighing it, this one mu and two fen (Chinese land measurement units), more than nine li (another Chinese land measurement unit) of land harvested a total of 5,717 jin, with an average yield of 4,412 jin per mu. At this time, the two old men were truly convinced.

Surrendered

The two old men, Li Xuecai and Yang Shengde, have now become voluntary propagandists. When they mentioned this high-yield field, they said: "We old conservatives are really not good! If everyone is like us, the yield will not be able to be increased in a lifetime. We will never 'argue with the cadres' again, and we will resolutely follow the Party." Several old men also composed a new song: "The old man lived to be one hundred and three, and never saw wheat produce several thousand jin. This is the good leadership of the Communist Party, this is Chairman Mao's fresh method, this is the great power of cooperation, and conservative thinking must be discarded." When the reporter went to this commune, the commune had already ordered next year's wheat production plan, with an average yield of 6,000 jin per mu and a high-yield mu reaching 10,000 jin. When the reporter asked if the old men's thoughts were clear, Li Xuecai said: "We belong to the bamboo pole, and we understand it all the way through." (Attached picture)

    “保守派”服输记
    本报记者　张励中
    编者按　我国小麦高产纪录不断出现，亩产三千斤、四千斤、五千多斤的奇迹越来越多。事实大大鼓舞了人们建设社会主义的积极性，也使人们进一步认识到农业生产的潜力十分巨大。以更快的速度发展我国农业生产，在短期内赶上和超过一切资本主义国家，这是完全可能的。但是，也有少数人至今对小麦高产纪录抱着怀疑态度，不大相信这样的事实。
    本报今天发表的通讯——“保守派”服输记，是一篇很值得一读的文章。它详细地描写了一块小麦高额丰产试验田的生产过程，描写了两个老农如何由不相信小麦可以丰产到完全信服了亩产四千多斤小麦的事实。读了这篇文章，谁还能不相信小麦丰产的奇迹呢？
    河南省商丘县双楼社赵庄队有两个小青年，一个是生产队长杨圣伦（转业军人、共产党员），一个是青年团支部书记杨广居。他们在去年根据上级党委的号召，确定搞一块亩产八百斤的丰产田。消息传出后，触动了村里的“保守派”，尤其是这个队的两个老“行手”李学才和杨圣德，他们到处嘀咕着：咱这祖宗三代种地，没有犁把高就学犁地，到现在也算一辈子了，从来没听能打这样多的麦子。全队开会讨论丰产计划的时候，两个老头出来说话了，李学才对队长杨圣伦说：“圣伦，你十几岁上出去当兵，去年才回来，扬场不会换肩，锄地弯不下腰，要论开会讲话，老哥不如你，要说种地，你还是‘离把头’（外行的意思），“得叫我一辈子老哥”。杨圣德老汉接过来说：“咱们去院里开会吧”，众人问他为啥？他说：“别把房顶叫咱们吹崩了，小麦古来都是低产，要想八百斤除非连秆都算上。”会上，本来大家劲头很足，叫他们两个人一说，好多人泄了气，会议不欢而散了。
    圣伦、广居接着又召开了全队的积极分子会议。本来情绪很高一心要和圣伦、广居一道搞丰产的妇女队长陈秀荣在会上说：“咱们要是打不到八百斤，将来可没法向群众交代。”圣伦说：“一定要打到，别人不干，我们七、八个党、团员积极分子，一夜不睡就可以把一亩地翻一个遍，没有什么解决不了的困难。”杨广居种地比较内行，在会上提出：深翻土地一尺五，分层施底肥，密植三十二斤种，一定要把基础打好。于是大家的干劲又鼓起来了。
    打破常规　大胆革新
    整地的季节来到了，他们找了一块秋季高粱被水淹了的地，先用双铧犁深耕六寸，紧接着，就用镢头、铁锨普遍进行了深翻。他们每翻一层地便撒一层粪，播种前共上了八千斤人粪和猪粪，还有一万三千五百斤草肥和土肥。李学才、杨圣德一听这些小伙子们在翻地又破常规地上了这么多肥料，气的胡子一噘一噘地议论开了，这个说：“这伙子年青人简直是胡吊弄，我种了一辈子麦，就没翻过地！”那个说：“黄鼠狼要能驾了辕，谁还买骡子干啥，这准又是圣伦出的怪点子，嘿！等到麦收后看吧，他们收的麦子要是能够粪的成本那才怪哩。”
    圣伦、广居虽然接二连三地在这两个“老保守”面前碰过了许多钉子，但是李学才、杨圣德他们两个人是全队最好的庄稼手，要搞好丰收要向有技术的人学习，播种时亲自把他们叫到地里，和他们共同研究怎样把丰产麦种好。李学才、杨圣德这两个老汉一到地里，二话没说，就问：“一亩准备下多少种？”杨圣伦答说：“三十二斤”。李学才鼻子里“哼”了一声，扭头就走，走了几步，又回过头来问杨圣伦：“过去一亩地一般播八斤，最多的播十二斤，咱这村的三等地，一亩地才收三、四十斤，将来收下来的麦子，能够本吗？”杨圣德趁火加油说：“你知耧眼有多大，把耧眼全放开，三十二斤种籽也漏不完。”圣伦说：“密植是外地的丰产经验。”这两个老头一听更恼火啦，说：“好！你们就去依靠这些洋点子吧！”说过便气呼呼地走了。当时，杨广居和杨圣伦心里又气又恼，当场便发誓：无论如何都要干出个样子，给那些“老保守”们看。因为用旧耧播种一亩三十二斤种子耩不下去，他们就研究着先用手撒种十五斤，剩余种子再用耧播。播种时，杨广居说：“这可真是大胆创造，过去连见都没见过。”圣伦说：“干吧，种好了有经验，种坏了有教训，反正给大地丰产找出样子。”这样，除了畦背以外，地里全是麦子。种上后，又浇了一水，麦苗黑绿的长出来了。
    闯过倒伏关
    到清明节的时候，麦子已经盖满地，麦叶黑油油的像韭菜。有一次，杨圣伦派李学才、杨圣德两个老头向这丰产地里拉粪（两老汉管使牲口），施第四次追肥。他们一计算，这块地已经施了三次底肥、三次追肥了，什么人粪、“硫酸铵”、颗粒肥料、草肥、房土，共计不下五万斤。李学才说：“这些年青人要疯，真不知种地是咋回事，这样搞非倒伏不可！”原来，在1951年这个村里有一个杨广训，在五分菜园地里种了一块麦子，施肥特别多，麦子长的撒土不漏，分外惹人喜欢，当时有经验的老农都估计能收千把斤，谁料想后来倒伏了，只收二百五十斤。这个事给这个村的群众留下了“小麦不能稠，稠了就倒伏”的结论。杨圣德、李学才便拼命拿这个例子来攻击杨广居和杨圣伦等种的丰产地，说密植、上肥多根本长不起来。
    为了防止倒伏，杨圣伦和杨广居这伙子干部，也开动了脑筋。他们跑到农业技术站找技术干部想办法。农业技术干部告诉他们：根据农业科学理论，土地经过深翻，麦根扎的深，就可以在一定程度内防止倒伏；如再施些草木灰，可以壮秆，就更加保险了。从此，他们便每天挨家挨户收草木灰，到小麦将要孕穗时，共收集了一千多斤。圣伦叫李学才、杨圣德两个人套车把灰拉到地里，这次，两个老头恼火透啦！杨圣德噘起了胡子嘴：“哼！刚上完第四次追肥，现在又上草木灰！现在麦苗才长二尺多高，就密的连个下脚的地方都没有，保险长倒了完事。”李学才气在肚里，想出了一个坏点子：一千斤草木灰，明明套两个牲口就够了，偏套了四个。杨圣德问他干啥，他气呼呼地说：“咱说不能再上粪了，套上这四个牲口到地里转一圈，把麦给他踩坏了去龟孙！”话虽然这样说，但是，当他们赶着车走到地头上，看到长得齐刷刷地麦苗，又实在不忍心下那样地毒手了。站在地头上的杨圣伦，看见他们拉了灰来，立即招呼他们把灰卸到地头上，让他们坐着休息，另派了几个妇女脱赤了脚，细心地拨开了麦棵，提着篮子往地里撒开了。这两个老头坐在地头上冷眼旁观，但见，一刹时：那些妇女们的头发上、眼眉上、衣服上，都被满天飞扬的灰末沾满了，简直成了灰人，他们的心里又好气又好笑，不约而同地叹气说：“唉！真是作孽啊！”低着头赶着车回村了。
    “保守派”开始动摇
    麦子快出穗了，有一天圣德和学才两个做完了牲口屋的活，又叼着烟袋来到了这块丰产地，转过两圈，李学才老汉说话了：“咱种了一辈子地没见过这么好的麦苗，就是太稠了！按过去经验，至少在十棵中有三棵顶不出穗来。剩下的就是出了穗，顶多也只能蝇子头那样大。”圣德老汉讽刺说：“干部种的麦还敢不出么！”又过了半个月，麦子出齐穗了。学才、圣德又到丰产地里看麦子来了。他们看到上面密密麻麻的铺满了一层又粗又大的麦穗大吃一惊。李学才二话没说，就用手扒开了麦垅，他找了半天，真奇怪，一个丢头都没找到。他咋着嘴，来回又走了几趟，自言自语地：“奇怪啊！真是长出神来了。”圣德老汉在一旁漫不经心的说：“过去咱们种的晒垡好地，顶多也只收二百多斤，这次给他多打一倍吧，四百斤到顶了，隔八百斤也还差远啦！”
    麦子熟了！一天圣伦和广居特地请这两个老汉来和他们估产。来到丰产地头，本来个子不太高的李学才要得抬起手来才能够到麦头，钻到麦地里就看不见了。两个老头嘀咕了半天，谁也不发表意见。干部们再三催他们谈，学才说：“咱们没经过这样麦，估不透”。“你们放开思想随便估吧！”李学才鼓了半天劲说：“那么就算六百斤吧！”“不能多了吗？”“算八百斤吧！”“还能不能多打？”学才说：“算一千六！”学才心里想：你再叫我说，我就说打五千斤，越说多了你们越高兴，反正我估计的真实产量是四百斤。这时候，干部们也进了选“方”、数棵、数穗、数籽，推算的结果，每亩地合一百六十多万株，每穗合四十来个籽，可收四千五百九十多斤。当场李学才、杨圣德等老年人便乱嚷起来了。李学才说：“干部嘴大，说啥是啥，说大话不纳税，直管说吧。反正只要一打场，还怕不露馅？”
    麦场上的“监督岗”
    割丰产地里的麦子了！根本没用队长招呼，就一呼?来了二十多人。来的人各有各的目的，老年人参加收麦，是为了自己亲眼看看究竟能打多少？是不是像干部吹的那样大，年青人是好奇心趋使，都想到丰产地收麦子。一亩大的地方，二十来人收麦特别热闹。麦棵稠、秆子高，拔起来很费劲，二十来个人，从早起一直拔到日头偏西才拔完。因为麦子长的好，捆起来的麦个，一个挨一个，这块地放不下，还要放到四周别的地里。拔完麦，李学才、杨圣德两个老汉，在地头端详了半天，李学才说：“这麦看样子可能超过四百斤”，杨圣德老汉拾起一个麦捆掂了掂，然后说：“这麦能收六百斤？我看达不到。打场的时候，咱们操点心，看能打多少斤。”
    为了使产量一点不差，拔完麦，两个老头亲自套上车往场上运麦，一共拉了五大车；再加上十来个妇女的扛运，这一亩地的麦共堆成三大垛。当天下午就决定打场，老汉们听说要打场，更紧张了，以李学才、杨圣德为首，还有杨广训等一群老年人，时刻不离场，打场赶牲口拉磙子由李学才、杨圣德两个人包下了。在三大垛麦子中，先拣了一小垛麦打头场，打场的时候，他们不时的扒开小麦秸看看底下有多厚的麦籽，一轧完后，收场的时候，干部又叫老头们估一估有多少？老头们看三垛麦子才打了一小垛，能收多少，大胆估计能有十斛（一斛三十斤）。扬完场一量，共收了三十二斛，有千把斤粮食，这时候，年青人们都高兴的跳起来了，可是李学才、杨圣德他们一伙子，蹲在场边上，好像斗败的公鸡，直在那里喘大气。紧接着连夜打第二场，第三场，这时候已是干了一个整夜了，这两个老头一直坚持到最后。全场打完一过秤，这一亩二分九厘多土地，共收五千七百一十七斤，平均亩产四千四百一十二斤。这时候，这两个老头才算真服了。
    服输了
    李学才、杨圣德两个老汉，现在成了义务宣传员，提起这块丰产地，他们就说：“我们这老保守可真不行啦！都像我们这样，产量一辈也提不高，以后再不跟干部‘打蹩了’，坚决跟党走。”他们几个老头还编了一首新歌：“老头活到一百三，没见过小麦产几千，这是共产党好领导，这是毛主席的办法鲜，这是合作化的力量大，保守思想要丢完”。记者去这个社时，这个社已订出明年小麦增产计划，平均亩产六千斤，丰产亩达万斤。记者问老头们思想通不通时，李学才说：“我们是属竹杆的，一通到底啦。”（附图片）
