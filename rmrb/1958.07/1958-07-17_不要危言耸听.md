Don't Be an Alarmist
Yi Wen

Inspired by the Party's General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results, Wang Lei, a young physician from the Department of Stomatology at Beijing Medical College, broke away from the blind faith in Anglo-American dental authorities and successfully researched and developed a "non-tooth-grinding fixed bridge." This innovation can simplify the Anglo-American medical procedures currently used in the Department of Oral Orthopedics, improve medical efficiency, and reduce patient suffering.

This is undoubtedly a significant innovation in Chinese stomatology, a welcome development for everyone. However, before this innovation was successful, a few professors in the Department of Stomatology at the medical college did not welcome it, but rather tried to prevent it. As soon as they heard that Wang Lei wanted to innovate, they summoned him and sternly questioned him: "How much world literature have you read? How much clinical experience do you have? What scientific basis do you have?" After questioning, they added "advice": "To engage in this innovation, you must first study anthropology, endocrinology, nutrition, and archeology, and then set a ten-year research plan, otherwise..." Otherwise what? The professors didn't say, but it's predictable.

According to these professors, inventions and creations are unattainable. Do you want to invent and create? Then please first read through the "world literature," and first master anthropology, nutrition, archeology, etc.; otherwise, don't even think about it. If Wang Lei, a young and strong man, really followed these professors' "advice," even if he turned into an old man with white hair, he would not be able to invent and create. As for those working people with low or no cultural level, they shouldn't even think about inventions and creations.

The reality is of course not as these professors imagined. Wang Lei was not intimidated, nor did he put down his research work and go back to study for ten years to engage in creation. Instead, he and several other young people worked hard and finally succeeded in the trial production. In fact, these professors' words can only deceive those who blindly believe in foreign experts. History, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has repeatedly proven that the most inventions and creations are not made by intellectuals who have read tens of thousands of books, but by working people who have not read much or have not read at all. On the contrary, those who have read tens of thousands of books rarely create, or do not create at all.

It is said that in scientific research work, some people are unwilling to revolutionize themselves and unwilling to let others revolutionize, making scientific research seem unattainable, truly "raising an alarm to frighten people"; this has "unspeakable reasons." What are the "unspeakable reasons"? It turns out that some people are still using lecture notes copied from Anglo-American textbooks from ten years ago. Therefore, as soon as someone invents or creates something, the titles of famous professor and famous scholar cannot be maintained. In order to maintain their titles of famous professor and famous scholar, they have to prohibit others from inventing and creating. However, all revolutions cannot be stopped. The same is true of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. The vast majority of professors have already undergone self-revolution and joined the ranks of the revolution; those who have not yet decided to revolutionize should quickly awaken and join the furnace of revolution, and revolutionize together with young intellectuals and working people!

    不要危言耸听
    弋文
    北京医学院口腔学系青年医师王镭，最近在党的多快好省的总路线的鼓舞下，破除了对英美口腔学权威的迷信，研究试制成功了一种“不磨牙固定桥”。这个创造，可以简化口腔矫形科目前所沿用的英美的一套医疗程序，提高医疗效率，又可以减轻病人痛苦。
    这当然是中国口腔学方面的一个重大革新，是值得人人欢迎的好事情。但是，在这个创造成功之前，这个医学院口腔系的少数教授对这件事却不是表示欢迎，而是加以阻止。他们一听说王镭要搞创造，就把王镭叫了去，声色俱厉地质问道：“你看过多少世界文献？你有多少临床经验？你有什么科学根据？”质问之后，又加以“劝告”：“要搞这个创造，就要先学人类学、内分泌学、营养学和考古学，然后再定上个十年研究计划，否则……。”否则怎样呢？教授虽然没有说出来，但是可以预料到的。
    按照这些教授的看法，发明创造是高不可攀的。你要想发明创造吗？那么就请你先读通“世界文献”，先去精通人类学、营养学、考古学等等；否则，你就别想。如果真的按照这些教授们的“劝告”去做，那年轻力壮的王镭即使变成白发苍苍的王镭，也不能发明创造。至于那些文化水平不高或没有文化的劳动人民，就根本不要想发明创造。
    事实当然不如这些教授们所想像的，王镭并没有因此被吓倒，也没有放下研究工作，再去读上十年书，来搞创造，而是同其他几个青年苦干苦钻之下，终于试制成功。其实，这些教授们的话，只能欺骗迷信外国迷信专家的人，古今中外历史一再地证明，发明创造最多的，并不是那些读破万卷书的知识分子，而是没有读过多少书的甚至根本没有读过书的劳动人民。相反的，读破万卷书的人倒很少创造，或者根本没有创造。
    据说，在科学研究工作中，有人自己不愿革命，又不愿别人革命，把科学研究说得高不可攀，真所谓“危言耸听”；这是有“难言之隐”的。什么“难言之隐”呢？原来有人现在所用的讲义，还是抄自十年前的英美教科书的。因此，有人一发明一创造，名教授、名学者的头衔就此保持不住了。为了保持自己名教授名学者的头衔，就不得不禁止别人发明创造。但是，一切革命都是阻止不了的。技术革命和文化革命也是一样。绝大多数教授已经自我革命，投入革命的行列中了；有些还没有决心革命的人，应当赶快觉悟，投入革命的洪炉中来，同青年知识分子同劳动人民一起革命吧！
