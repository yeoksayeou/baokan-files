    Popular Simple Wards
    Driven by the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, the staff of the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College put their minds to work, tapped potential, and set up a simple ward for the vast number of patients.
    From the very beginning of its preparation, this simple ward adhered to the principle of "not spending a single penny of the state's money, without increasing manpower or materials." All departments and offices in the hospital provided support in terms of manpower and materials. The ward has a total of four nurses who are working with full enthusiasm for the patients.
    This simple ward can reduce the economic burden on patients, especially those from the countryside. For example, a cervical cancer patient from the countryside used to spend 1.10 yuan per day just for accommodation while receiving treatment at the outpatient clinic. After moving to the simple ward, the daily cost for meals and all other expenses was only 0.80 yuan. Another hernia patient stayed in the simple ward for seven days, and the total cost, including the surgery, was 19 yuan. In the past, it would have cost more than 50 yuan in an ordinary ward. Patients' meals are based on a meal ticket system, paying only for what they eat. At the same time, the establishment of the simple ward has also increased the hospital's bed utilization rate.
    The simple ward does not affect the quality of medical care due to its simple facilities. Every day, the doctors carefully examine the patients and provide treatment. The nursing staff cares for the patients with even greater dedication, frequently turning over severely ill patients, feeding them water, and closely monitoring changes in their condition. One patient was about to be discharged when he suddenly had abdominal pain. The nurse promptly reported the condition, and the doctor discovered it was appendicitis. He quickly recovered and was discharged after surgery. Another patient with an abdominal wall abscess had several thousand cc of pus drained, and he was incontinent of urine and feces. The nurses patiently cleaned him every day. The patients were very moved by the work ethic of the staff. Patients who could move around volunteered to help the medical staff with cleaning. Some farmers left their addresses when they were discharged and asked the staff to visit them.

### 受欢迎的简易病房

    受欢迎的简易病房
    北京医学院第一附属医院的职工们在全国大跃进形势的推动下，开动脑筋，挖潜力，为广大病人设置了一种简易病房。
    这个简易病房从开始筹备就坚持了“不花国家一个钱，不增加人力物力”的原则，全院各科、室从人力物力各方面给以支援。病房共有四个护士都是热情饱满地为病人们工作着。
    这种简易病房可为病人特别是从农村来的病人减少经济负担，如有一个从乡下来的子宫颈癌患者，原来每天在门诊治疗，仅住旅馆一项每天要花一元一角，到简易病房后，每天吃饭和一切费用只要八角。还有一个疝气病人在简易病房住了七天，连作手术共用了十九元，过去若在普通病房就要花五十多元。病人吃饭实行了饭票制，吃多少，交多少钱。同时，简易病房开设后，也使医院病床使用率提高了。
    简易病房并没有因为设备简单而影响医疗质量。每天，大夫们都认真地查病房，进行治疗。护理同志们更是加倍地关心病人们，给重病号勤翻身，多喂水，密切注视病情变化，有一个病人快出院了，忽然肚疼，护士及时反映病情，医生发现是阑尾炎，动手术后很快出院。另一个腹壁脓肿的病人，抽出几千cc脓液，大小便失禁，护士每天耐心地给他擦洗。病人们对工作人员这种工作精神都很感动，能走动的病人抢着帮助医务人员大扫除，有的农民出院时留下地址要求工作人员去玩。  吴焜
