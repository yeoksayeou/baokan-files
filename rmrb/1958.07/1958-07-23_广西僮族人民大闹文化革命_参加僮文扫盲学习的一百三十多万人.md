Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 22nd. The Zhuang people of Guangxi are vigorously launching a cultural revolution. In the past ten days or so, the number of people participating in Zhuang literacy classes has surged by more than 400,000. According to incomplete statistics, the number of students now enrolled has reached more than 1.3 million and is still increasing. It is estimated that by the end of July and the beginning of August, all of the region's more than 3 million young and middle-aged Zhuang illiterates will be enrolled in school, forming a high tide in the Zhuang literacy campaign.

Currently, in the region's 49 Zhuang-populated counties, 5 districts, 181 townships, and 693 cooperatives have basically eliminated illiteracy. More than 300,000 people throughout the region are able to independently spell out new texts. Among them, more than 100,000 people have memorized more than 2,000 commonly used words, reaching the cultural level of elementary school. They can not only use Zhuang script to record work points and write simple notes, but also write Zhuang songs, folk tales and other literary works.

Having freed themselves from illiteracy, the broad masses of the Zhuang people are urgently demanding to increase their cultural and scientific knowledge. The Guangxi Nationalities Publishing House has published more than 4.54 million copies of Zhuang books on politics, science, and literature in the past year, but the supply still cannot meet the demand. This month, it is rushing to print more than 700,000 copies. The number of subscriptions to "Zhuangwen Bao" in various counties and townships has also greatly increased. In Guixian County, only more than 310 copies were ordered in June, but in July this rose to more than 1,360 copies. (Attached photo)

    广西僮族人民大闹文化革命
    参加僮文扫盲学习的一百三十多万人
    新华社南宁22日电  广西僮族人民大闹文化革命。最近十几天，参加僮文扫盲学习人数激增四十多万。据不完全统计，现在入学人数已达一百三十多万人，并且还在不断增加。估计到7月底8月初，自治区三百多万僮族青壮年文盲将全部入学，形成僮文扫盲运动的高潮。
    目前，自治区四十九个僮族聚居县，已有五个区、一百八十一个乡和六百九十三个社基本扫除文盲。全区有三十多万人能够独立拼读新课文。其中，十万多人已能熟记两千个以上常用词，达到初小文化程度，不仅能用僮文记工分，写简单便条，并且能写僮歌、民间故事等文艺作品。
    摆脱了文盲状态的广大僮族人民群众，迫切地要求增加文化科学知识。广西民族出版社在过去一年中出版了四百五十四万多册政治、科学、文艺等僮文书籍，仍然供不应求，这个月又在赶印七十多万册。各个县、乡订阅“僮文报”的份数也大大增加。贵县6月份只订三百一十多份，7月份上升到一千三百六十多份。（附图片）
