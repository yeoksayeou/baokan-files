Remarkable Achievements in Eliminating the Four Pests
Chengde This Summer No Flies Found
    According to Hebei Daily, the people of Chengde City, through persistent struggle against the four pests, have achieved great success on the front of eliminating them. Recently, representatives from various regions attending the on-site conference of the Hebei Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee held in Chengde Prefecture visited the city's campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. During the visit, no flies were found in the urban area.
    The fundamental reason why Chengde City's campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene can withstand the test of summer and completely eliminate flies is that they used a revolutionary spirit to carry out continuous mass extermination of the four pests, adopting a combination of curative and preventative measures. When deploying fly extermination work last winter, the city emphasized the need to learn from past lessons, implement a close combination of curative and preventative measures, and comprehensively eliminate the breeding conditions of flies from the root. It required everyone to take action, achieving "one digging" (digging fly pupae), "two renovations" (renovating toilets and pigsties), and "three thoroughness" (thoroughly eliminating fly breeding conditions, thorough disinfection, and thorough capture and killing). More than 144,000 people throughout the city were mobilized to participate in this campaign. Toilets were covered, pupae were dug out of cesspools, and cesspools were converted into jar pits with lids. Pigsties were renovated, and sewage seepage pits were dug in each yard. Taking the above measures eliminated the breeding conditions of flies from the root. The city disseminated this method to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs in a timely manner through organized visits and publicity at meetings. After this was universally adopted throughout the city, it laid the foundation for completely eliminating flies.
    When flies began to become active this summer, the city's Four Pests Elimination Headquarters immediately issued an emergency mobilization order to the people of the city. It called for taking the initiative to quickly eliminate flies. From cadres to the masses, from the old to the young, everyone used fly swatters throughout the city. When there were not enough fly swatters, people made their own homemade fly swatters. Middle school students also came up with the "lure the enemy to the feast method," placing some stinky fish under the shade of trees to attract flies to eat and concentrate on eliminating them. Some people dug up large *lu li* grass in the mountains to poison flies. Due to the close combination of curative and preventative measures, flies decreased day by day, to the point that they could not be found at all.

    除四害取得显著成绩
    承德夏天没有发现苍蝇
    据河北日报消息　承德市人民由于向四害进行了坚持不懈的斗争，在除四害战线上取得了巨大成绩。最近，参加省爱国卫生运动委员会在承德专区召开的现场会议的各地代表，参观了这个城市的除四害讲卫生运动，在参观期间，人们在市区内没有发现一只苍蝇。
    承德市的除四害讲卫生运动，能经得住夏季的考验，比较彻底地消灭了苍蝇，最根本的原因，是他们用革命的精神对四害进行了连续地群众性的捕杀，采取了治标治本相结合的措施。去冬开始部署灭蝇工作时，该市强调提出要接受以往的教训，实行治标治本紧密结合，从根本上消灭苍蝇孳生条件的综合措施。要求人人动手，做到一挖（挖蝇蛹）、两改（翻改厕所和猪圈）、三彻底（彻底消灭蝇的孳生条件、彻底消毒、彻底捕打）。全市动员起十四万四千多人投入了这个运动。厕所盖了顶，粪坑挖了蛹，改为缸坑并加了盖；改造了猪圈，每院还挖了污水渗池。采取上面的措施，就从根本上消灭了苍蝇的孳生条件。该市通过组织参观、会议上宣传，及时把这个办法传播到郊区农业合作社。这样全市普遍采用以后，就给彻底消灭苍蝇打下了基础。
    今年入夏蝇子开始活动的时候，市除四害指挥部又立即向全市人民发出了紧急动员令。要求打主动仗，迅速消灭苍蝇。从干部到群众，从老到小，人手一拍遍于全市。捕打工具不够用，人们就自制土蝇拍。中学生们还想出了“诱敌赴筵法”，在树荫下放些臭鱼，引蝇来吃，集中消灭。有的人在山上挖来大芦莉草毒苍蝇。由于治标治本紧密结合，苍蝇逐日减少，以致找也找不到了。
