	Respectfully Celebrating the 37th Anniversary of the Communist Party of China
	Spanning five thousand years,
	Across ninety thousand *li*.
	From ancient times to modern,
	Whose merits can compare?
	The backward old China,
	Almost nothing was right.
	Who knew in ten years?
	The face is completely new.
	Six hundred million people,
	Compared to scattered sand.
	What is it like today?
	United as one.
	Dozens of ethnic groups,
	All saw a history of oppression.
	What is it like now?
	Like one big family.
	Feudalism for thousands of years,
	In the lives of the people.
	Saving the dying not even considered,
	Where is the time to care about morality?
	Even more in the last hundred years,
	There was imperialism.
	Double axes felled the withered tree,
	Chopping and chopping again.
	The nation and the people,
	Awaiting the day of demise.
	The toiling masses,
	How could they hope for governance?
	One day a savior came,
	Turbulent changes, heaven and earth.
	The people gained liberation,
	Managing their own affairs.
	The people are the masters,
	Customs and habits change easily.
	Everyone is equal,
	Loving each other like brothers.
	The people's awareness is high,
	Strength greater than the atom.
	Productivity is liberated,
	The people live and thrive.
	The country becomes richer and stronger,
	The world looks on with new eyes.
	The great leap forward is vigorous,
	The masses are truly reliable.
	The great leap forward is drumming up energy,
	One day equals twenty years of work.
	Surpassing England in the short term,
	Eventually surpassing North America.
	Rottenness transformed into magic,
	Negativity transformed into positivity.
	Clearly it is done by people,
	People are surprised with gods and ghosts.
	How did this happen?
	It is the Party's leadership that bestows this.
	The Party's general leadership,
	Wise Chairman Mao.
	Naturally intelligent,
	Outstanding and exceptional.
	Since the birth of mankind,
	Never has this been seen.
	The Party is thirty-seven years old,
	Just like the rising sun.
	Shining on the world,
	Ten thousand years without end.
	Bringing happiness to the world,
	Longevity matching the heavens.
	Grand occasion stirs the heart,
	Prayers and emotions are endless.

    敬祝中国共产党三十七周年生日	李济深
    上下五千年，
    纵横九万里。
    古今到中外，
    功德孰比拟？
    落后旧中国，
    百几无一是。
    孰知十年间？
    面目全新矣。
    六亿人民众，
    人以散沙比。
    今日究如何？
    团结成一体。
    民族几十种，
    尽见压迫史。
    而今究如何？
    一大家庭似。
    封建几千年，
    人民生活里。
    救死犹不瞻，
    希暇顾廉耻。
    更是百年来，
    有帝国主义。
    双斧伐枯树，
    一摘又再摘。
    国家与人民，
    丧亡日在俟。
    芸芸苦大众，
    喁喁怎望治？
    一朝救星来，
    翻腾变天地。
    人民得解放，
    自管自己事。
    人民作主人，
    风移俗也易。
    人人都平等，
    亲爱如兄弟。
    人民觉悟高，
    力量比原子。
    生产力解放，
    人民好生息。
    国家日富强，
    世界刮目视。
    跃进劲头大，
    人众真可恃。
    跃进劲鼓足，
    一日廾年事。
    短期迈英伦，
    终能跨北美。
    腐朽化神奇，
    消极变积极。
    明明是人为，
    相惊有神鬼。
    夫何使之然？
    是党领导赐。
    党的总领导，
    贤明毛主席。
    天亶作聪明，
    拔萃而出类。
    自生民以来，
    未曾见有此。
    党生卅七载，
    正如方升日。
    普照人世间，
    万年无底止。
    造福遍人寰，
    长寿齐天纪。
    盛况激心情，
    祝祷情难已。
