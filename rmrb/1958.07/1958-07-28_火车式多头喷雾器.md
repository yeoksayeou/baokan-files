    Train-Style Multi-Head Sprayer

    After the Wusong Town Sheet Metal Production Group was transformed into the local state-owned Shanghai North Suburb Sprayer Factory, the workers' enthusiasm soared to unprecedented heights. Using their spare time, they successfully trial-produced a hand-pushed train-style multi-head automatic sprayer. This sprayer is based on the principle of a train, using a single wheel to move forward and compress air, allowing eight nozzles to spray two crop rows at a time. It can not only be used to spray and kill pests on various crops, but also as a sprinkler truck for drought resistance.

    火车式多头喷雾器
    吴淞镇白铁生产小组转为地方国营上海市北郊区喷雾器制造厂后，工人们的干劲空前高涨。他们利用业余时间，试制成功一台手推火车式多头自动喷雾器。这种喷雾器是根据火车的原理，通过独车轮前进来压进空气，使装有八个喷头一次能喷田二畦。它不但能用来喷杀各种农作物上的害虫，而且能作为抗旱的洒水车。
