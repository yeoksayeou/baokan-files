Title: Never "Show Off Your Tail"

There is still a need to further discuss Comrade Shen Changlin's "old experience."

"As long as you take the lead, others will follow without being urged." This is indeed a "old experience" that Comrade Shen Changlin has accumulated over more than twenty years. According to the record in the Yan'an Liberation Daily in March 1943 (Huang Ke, "Model Party Member Comrade Shen Changlin"), he had already been using this method since 1939. At that time, it was mainly manifested in two aspects: burden and production.

The article introduced: "In the past four years (from 1939 to 1942), the whole village burdened 76.6 shi of public grain, and Comrade Shen Changlin burdened 43.8 shi, accounting for more than 57%. The whole village burdened 2,225 jin of public salt, and Comrade Shen Changlin burdened 1,045 jin, accounting for 47%." "Among the thirteen households in the village, there are twelve laborers and a total of ten cattle. Comrade Shen Changlin's family has eight people, but only two and a half laborers... but they have four cattle. So no matter what, Comrade Shen Changlin's burden is always amazing."

Taking the lead in burden did not damage the development of Comrade Shen Changlin's family economy. In 1943, his family had "four cattle, one donkey, one hundred and twenty sheep, and six cave dwellings... This year, he plans to plant enough 75 *xiang* of land, buy another donkey, and estimate that the flock of sheep can be expanded to one hundred and eighty. He strives to make the average yield per *xiang* of land two or three *dou* more than ordinary farmers." This development is naturally due to diligent production.

With Lao Shen taking the lead in this way, not only the people in the whole village, but also the rural areas near Majiagou, have generally had such calls: "Although Lao Shen burdens more, he is still better off than before in the past two years. It seems that everyone should still produce well."

This is proof of "following without being urged."

Fifteen years later, the people of Majiagou still maintain this unity and do not fall behind in everything. I personally heard a farmer sing two lines: "Shake your arms and raise your hands, how the Party members go, so do we!" How much respect and trust the masses have for someone who always walks in front!

"Leading the way" and "not being urged" do not mean not opening your mouth, not speaking, or not publicizing the Party's policies and your own thoughts. No matter who it is, the reason why they can "lead the way" is because they have a new idea. Shen Changlin can take the lead in burden because he has the idea that "the more public grain you pay, the better, it is precisely that you are expanding yourself, and what the public wants is limited after all," and because he has the idea that "if you produce a few more grains, the public has a way, and everyone has a way"; others follow because they have turned this idea into their own idea. Shen Changlin took the lead in the Great Leap Forward because he had the idea that "if we had leaped forward two years earlier, our Yan'an would have changed its appearance long ago," and because he had the idea that "we must always have a big rush, so that we can always make progress." And the "change" and "rush" that he yearns for is the prospect of a happy life that he has already seen, and it is precisely what everyone yearns for, so they follow.

There is another extremely valuable idea in the sentence "As long as you take the lead, others will follow without being urged," and that is Comrade Shen Changlin's infinite trust in the masses. He completely believes that the majority of the masses are not backward, and as long as you explain the matter to them clearly, they will definitely follow.

I am talking about this very ordinary truth mainly for some "masses are backward" theorists. Also in the rural areas of Yan'an, I also saw some other grassroots cadres who always like to publicize the backwardness and passivity of the masses, and even openly shouted at meetings that if they did not use coercive methods to "drive with a stick behind their ass," the masses would not act. Their slogan is "Whether you bite or not, you have to show off your tail first." That is to say, to scare the masses. They didn't even think a little bit about how "showing off your tail" could gain the trust of the masses that "no one does not listen" and "no one does not go"?

Comrades in Yan'an told me that because of the late start, when the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country came, the people of Yan'an still inevitably had the state of waking up from a big dream at first. In the case of rushing to start before there was time to explain clearly, it is naturally inevitable that some people cannot unfold their hands and feet, and a passive state appears in some people. This requires explaining the truth carefully while acting, and spreading advanced ideas to the masses like Comrade Shen Changlin. Most people are doing this, and new ideas are gradually spreading among more people. However, a few people who lack brains want to show off their stupid tails instead of spreading new ideas. This tail is precisely the harmful thing that hinders the spread of new ideas. No matter how "eager for public affairs" their intentions are, the tail must not be "shown off"; and this harmful tail should be cut off quickly.

    千万不要“乍尾巴”
    刘甲
    对于申长林同志的“老经验”，还有再加谈论的必要。
    “你只要前头一走，别的人不用催就会来的。”这的确是申长林同志二十多年来积下的一条“老经验”，据1943年3月延安解放日报的记载（荒煤：“模范党员申长林同志”），早从1939年起，他就使用这种方法了。那时主要表现在负担和生产两个方面。
    那篇文章介绍：“四年来（从1939年到1942年）全村负担公粮七十六石六斗，申长林同志负担了四十三石八斗，占57％强，全村负担公盐二千二百二十五斤，申长林同志负担一千零四十五斤，占47％。”“全村十三户人家，有十二个劳动力，共有牛十条。申长林同志则家有八口人，只两个半劳动力……不过是有牛四条。所以不论怎么说，申长林同志的负担总是惊人的。”
    负担上带头，并没有损伤了申长林同志家庭经济的发展。1943年，他家有“四头牛，一条驴，一百二十只羊，六孔窑。……今年，他计划种够七十五垧地，再买一条驴，估计羊群可以扩大到一百八十只。他争取每垧地平均能比一般农民多收二三斗。”这发展自然是由于勤劳生产。
    老申在前边这么一走，不仅全村的人，而且马家沟附近一带农村里，都已普遍地有了这样的呼声：“老申虽然负担出的多，但是这两年光景还是比以前好多了。看起来，每个人还是该好好地生产。”
    这就是一种“不用催就跟上来”的证明。
    十五年后，马家沟的人们，也还是保持着这种团结一致，样样事情都不落在后头。我亲自听到一个农民唱的两句歌：“甩一甩胳膊扬一扬手，党员怎走咱怎走”！群众对于一个永远走在前面的人，是如何的尊崇和信赖呀！
    “前头走”，“不用催”，决不是说不张口，不说话，不宣传党的政策和自己的思想。无论是谁，所以能“前头走”，是因为他有一种新思想。申长林能在负担上带头，是他有“公粮越多出越好，正是自己扩大了，公家要的到底有限”的思想，是他有“多打几颗粮，公家有办法，大家也有办法了”的思想；别人跟上来，是把这种思想变成了自己的思想。申长林在大跃进中带头，是他有“早跃进两年，咱延安早就变了样”的思想，是他有“非时常有个大奔头，才能常进步”的思想。而他所想望的那“变样”和“奔头”，是已经看到了的幸福生活的前景，也正是大家所想望的，所以他们便跟上来。
    “你只要前头一走，别的人不用催就会来的”，这句话里还有一个极可宝贵的思想，这就是申长林同志对群众的无限信任，他完全相信多数群众是并不落后的，只要把话对他们说清楚，他们一定会跟着来的。
    我讲这极平常的道理，主要是给一些“群众落后论”者听的。同样在延安的农村，我还看到了另外一些基层干部，他们总爱宣传群众的落后，被动，甚至公然在会上嚷嚷说如果不用强迫命令的方法“用棍子在屁股后边赶”，群众是不会行动起来的。他们的口号是“你咬人不咬人，得先把尾巴乍（翘的意思）起来。”就是说要去吓唬群众。他们甚至没有稍微的想一想，“乍尾巴”如何能得到群众的“没有人不听”“没有人不走”的信任呢？
    延安的同志告诉我：由于动手较迟，全国大跃进的形势一来，延安人开初仍不免有大梦初醒的那种状态，在没有来得及把话说清楚就急迫动手的情况下，自然难免有些人展不开手脚，在一部分人中呈现被动的状态。这需要一边行动，一面细致的讲清道理，需要像申长林同志那样把先进的思想，传播给群众。多数的人正是这样做的，新的思想正逐渐在更多的人中传播开来。但是，少数缺乏头脑的人却想乍起他们愚蠢的尾巴来代替新思想的传播的。这尾巴，恰恰就是阻拦新的思想传播的害物。不管他们居心是如何的“急公”，尾巴还是“乍”不得的；而且应该赶快割掉这条有害的尾巴。
