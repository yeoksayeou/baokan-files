Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th: TASS reported that on July 3rd, the Soviet Union's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, delivered a note from the Soviet government to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, strongly protesting the anti-Soviet demonstrations held in front of the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations in New York on June 19th, 21st, and 22nd. The note pointed out that the situation created by the aforementioned hostile actions against the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations is intolerable. The note stated that if this situation continues, it could create a situation in which the Soviet Union can no longer participate in the work of the United Nations.

The note described the recent demonstrations held by thugs and provocateurs in front of the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations. The note emphasized that such atrocities against the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations occur frequently. The note stated that the Soviet side has repeatedly stated to the relevant US authorities that appropriate measures should be taken to protect the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations and its personnel from threats and provocations, to stop the aforementioned atrocities, and to ensure that the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations is given the conditions necessary for residence and work. However, to date, the US authorities have not taken such measures.

The note said that the continuous provocative actions are creating abnormal conditions for the work of the Soviet representative office, which is not accidental, but a result of the policy of those who are eager to sharpen the international situation and continue the "Cold War."

The US government's connivance with and, in fact, encouragement of the aforementioned provocative acts against the Soviet Union's mission in New York ignores the recognized norms of international law and violates its obligations to the United Nations. The UN Charter stipulates that the United Nations itself and the countries with representatives enjoy privileges and inviolability.

In addition, the US government signed a special agreement with the United Nations on June 26, 1947, regarding the location of the UN headquarters, which stipulates that the US government guarantees the normal working conditions of representatives of all member states of the United Nations.

The Soviet government's note said that the frequent provocations against the Soviet Union's mission to the United Nations prove that the US government has not fulfilled its obligations to the Soviet Union in this regard.

The note also said that if hostile demonstrations are carried out against the Soviet representative office in the future, and the Soviet representative office continues to lack normal working conditions, then a situation may be created in which the Soviet Union can no longer participate in the work of the United Nations. Perhaps those in the United States who should be held responsible for organizing the provocative attacks against the Soviet representative office want to create such a situation. The Soviet government believes that the United Nations cannot ignore this behavior.

The note stated that the Soviet government is issuing this note to the UN Secretary-General because it believes that its repeated protests to the US government have yielded no results. It is also due to the fact that if this situation continues, it cannot but seriously damage the prestige of the United Nations and undermine the fundamental basis for cooperation among countries within the United Nations framework. The note expects the UN Secretary-General to take the necessary measures in this regard and promptly respond to the Soviet government.

    苏联政府照会联合国秘书长
    抗议美国政府纵容歹徒对苏联挑衅
    联合国必须采取措施保证苏联代表正常工作
    新华社7日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：苏联驻联合国常驻代表索波列夫7月3日交给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一份苏联政府的照会，坚决抗议6月19日、21日和22日在纽约苏联驻联合国代表机构前面举行的敌视苏联的示威游行。照会指出，苏联驻联合国代表机构所处的由于上述敌意行动而造成的情况是不能令人容忍的。照会说，如果这种情况再继续下去，有可能造成一种使苏联不可能再参加联合国工作的局面。
    照会叙述了歹徒和挑衅分子不久以前在苏联驻联合国代表机构前面举行示威的情况。照会强调指出，对苏联驻联合国代表机构的这类暴行是经常发生的。照会说，苏联方面曾经不止一次地向美国有关当局提出，应当采取适当的措施来保护苏联驻联合国代表机构和代表机构人员不受威胁和挑衅，应当制止上述暴行，并且保证给苏联驻联合国代表机构以应有的居留和工作条件。但是，到目前为止，美国当局并没有采取这种措施。
    照会说，不断发生的挑衅行动给苏联代表机构的工作造成不正常的条件，这不是偶然的，这是那些渴望国际局势尖锐化和继续进行“冷战”的人士的政策的结果。
    美国政府纵容上述对苏联驻纽约的代表机构的挑衅行为而且事实上加以鼓励，这样做是忽视公认的国际法准则的，也是违背它对联合国的义务的。联合国宪章规定联合国本身以及派有代表的国家享有优遇和不可侵犯权。
    此外，美国政府同联合国在1947年6月26日就联合国中央机构驻地问题签订了一项专门协定，协定规定美国政府保证联合国所有成员国代表的正常工作条件。
    苏联政府的照会说，对苏联驻联合国代表机构的经常挑衅，证明美国政府没有对苏联执行它在这方面的义务。
    这个照会还说，如果今后对苏联代表机构再进行敌意的示威，苏联代表机构继续缺乏正常工作条件，那么就可能造成一种局面，使苏联不可能再参加联合国工作。也许，美国那些应该为组织对苏联代表机构进行挑衅袭击而负责的人正是要造成这样的局面。苏联政府认为联合国不能忽视这种行为。
    照会说，苏联政府所以向联合国秘书长发出这个照会，是因为考虑到它对美国政府多次提出的抗议，没有得到什么结果。同时也由于考虑到，这种局面如果继续下去，就不能不严重损害联合国的威信，不能不破坏各国在联合国范围内进行合作的根本基础。照会期待着联合国秘书长在这方面采取必要的措施，并且迅速答复苏联政府。
