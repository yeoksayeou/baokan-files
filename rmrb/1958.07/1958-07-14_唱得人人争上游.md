Singing Motivates Everyone to Strive Upward
Yin Guanglan

Editor's Note: Recently, a national conference of folk literature workers is being held in Beijing. Many peasant singers have come to Beijing, and their poetic inspiration is even more vigorous. Many singers spoke at the meeting, speaking and singing at the same time. Yin Guanglan, a female peasant singer from Anhui Province, was one of them. The following is a summary of her speech:

My name is Yin Guanglan, and I am from Dingguang Township, Feidong County, Anhui Province. I was given to the Wang Jialong family in Shanwang Village as a child bride when I was only half a month old.

　　Being a child bride for twenty years,
　　The pain of the past is as deep as the sea.
　　Twenty years have not been easy,
　　Suffering and hardship have shaped me.
　　At seven, I herded cattle and cut grass,
　　Cooked, did laundry.
　　If the rice was late, I would be beaten,
　　If I didn't cut enough grass, it wouldn't do.
　　One day it rained and the roads were muddy,
　　I only cut half a basket of grass by evening.
　　My in-laws said I was useless,
　　And punished me by not giving me food for a day.
　　I wasn't allowed to say a word in front of people,
　　I ate hidden behind the pot.
　　I had no political status,
　　And there was no talk of cultural life.

I loved to sing since I was a child. At the age of seven, I learned a dozen folk songs and ditties on the cattle herding hill. The Wang family was a feudal and old-fashioned family. They thought it was disgraceful for women to sing. One day I was singing on the field ridge and my father-in-law heard me. That was terrible! He scolded me severely in front of me, and then beat me up when I got back. He also warned me, "It's not proper for girls to sing. If I hear you singing again, I'll knock your teeth out." Although I was young at that time, I understood a little bit. Seeing the children of other families so free and so happy, I had no family and no relatives. I was often beaten and scolded in the Wang family. Who could I tell my grievances to? I could only shed tears or sing to vent my sorrow. My father-in-law didn't allow me to sing, but how could I not sing? But I didn't dare to sing in front of people anymore, I could only secretly sing on the cattle herding hill and in the fields.

In 1949, the People's Liberation Army liberated our hometown, and the poor people turned over, as if they had seen the sun through the dark clouds. Some of the People's Liberation Army lived in our village. The young girls, such as Wang Shuqin and Wang Fengqin, learned songs like "The East is Red," "Beating Well," and "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention" from the People's Liberation Army. I also wanted to learn in my heart, but I didn't dare to go. One day I went to my relative's house to play, and they were singing enthusiastically. I leaned against the door to listen. The squad leader asked me, "Little girl, they are all singing, why aren't you singing?" Wang Shuqin and the others said, "She can sing, and she sings very well." The comrades of the People's Liberation Army welcomed me to sing. I didn't sing, so everyone applauded and welcomed me, and closed the door and wouldn't let me go. So I sang a "New Twelve Months of Enlistment." This singing caused trouble. My father-in-law scolded me severely when I got back. Although this time he didn't beat me because there was the People's Liberation Army in the village, they didn't give me food, saying that I was full from singing. In 1951, the village set up a folk school, and the women went to school, so I went too. I didn't have money to buy books, so the teacher Wang Shaolun gave me an old book, but my father-in-law said, "If you go to school, then go out! You are not allowed to use the family's oil." He also said that if I continued to study, he would tear up my book. I only studied for three nights, and then they wouldn't let me study anymore.

In the winter of 1954, the County Cultural Center set up a people's club in our village on a trial basis. They were performing plays and singing and dancing. I couldn't hold back any longer. Without letting my family know, I secretly went to learn. From then on, I ate dinner earlier every day. As soon as I finished my meal, I went to learn.

My creation started in the rice planting season of 1955. At first, I thought: It would be a joke to ask us mud-legged people to do creative work! The cadres of the Cultural Center said: "As long as you say what's in your heart, and sing it like a Yangko dance, it can be considered a creation." One day in the rice fields, everyone was singing old Yangko songs. I thought of a few lines and sang them in the rice fields:

　　Jumping into the field to plant rice seedlings,
　　The people planting rice love to sing,
　　Plant the barnyard grass and it dies,
　　Plant the yellow seedlings and they all live,
　　They all live, they all live,
　　Tens of thousands of dan are stored in the granary,
　　Increase production to support industrialization,
　　Improve life and laugh heartily.

After returning home, I asked someone to write it down and sent it to the cadres in the Cultural Center. They said: "This is a very good creation." They also collected works and distributed them throughout the county.

In the past, I always felt that I was not a human being, living the life of cattle and horses. Only after liberation did I begin to feel that I was a real person. I joined the Youth League, attended the provincial youth representative meeting, the women's representative meeting, and the township nominated me as a township women's representative and people's representative. In 1956, with the help of the old artist Wang Shaoxi, I also learned to sing door songs. Because I was in a good mood, my singing was particularly loud. I sang whenever I went to the fields, and I sang at every meeting, from the village to the township, to the district, to the county. Probably because I sang a lot and sang well, everyone gave me the honorary title of "peasant singer." In January 1957, the organization asked me to represent everyone in the first folk music and dance performance in the special district and province, and I received the honor of a special prize. Who would have thought that a child bride who had suffered all kinds of hardships, a rural woman who couldn't read a single word, would have such a day! I couldn't help but sing:

　　The iron tree blooms for a thousand years,
　　The new country was established in 1949,
　　Feudal forces are all overthrown,
　　The working people are in power.
　　Every woman has turned over,
　　I go to winter school to learn culture.
　　Last year I joined the entertainment group,
　　I'm not afraid to sing and dance.
　　I joined the League in March this year,
　　I participate in all kinds of work.
　　Last time women elected representatives,
　　They asked me to be in charge.
　　I actively work in production,
　　Everyone praises me.
　　Thank the Communist Party for saving me,
　　Pushing down the thousand layers of mountains on my head.
　　Now I've broken through the feudal barrier,
　　Taking the lead in all kinds of work.
　　Sing a door song to express my feelings,
　　Sing the song to thousands of homes.

The Party leads us to move forward forever, and our creations are like the rolling Yangtze River, constantly flowing. Through actual creation, we have gained some experience and summarized it into the following sentences:

　　Don't be afraid of creating, everyone can speak smoothly, the theme must be one, don't create random branches.
　　If the language is exhausted, change to another tune. After everything is compiled, review it from the beginning,
　　Keep the good ones, remove the bad ones, revise and revise again, and finally succeed!

What I want to say is that I can't finish talking in three days and three nights. In summary, I thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for cultivating me, and thank the comrades around me for supporting me, so that I, a child bride who has suffered all kinds of hardships, have broken out of the feudal cage and become a real person. The old society forced me to pretend to be deaf and mute, and the new society has cultivated me into a singer for the peasants. I guarantee that under the brilliant light of the general line, I will create more and sing more, singing motivates everyone to strive upward, and the red flag is planted everywhere.

    唱得人人争上游
    殷光兰
    编者按　最近，北京正在举行全国民间文学工作者大会。许多农民歌手都来到了北京，他们的诗情更加旺盛，许多歌手在会上发言，一面说，一面歌唱，安徽省农民女歌手殷光兰就是其中的一个。现将她的发言摘要发表如下：
    我叫殷光兰，是安徽省肥东县定光乡人。我出生半个月就被抱给山王村王家龙家做童养媳。
    童养媳当了二十年，
    从前的痛苦海样深。
    二十年来不易过，
    受苦受难磨成人。
    七岁放牛带割草，
    烧锅做饭洗衣裳。
    煮饭迟了要挨打，
    割草少了就不行。
    有天下雨道路烂，
    到晚只割草半篮。
    公婆说我不中用，
    罚我一天没吃饭。
    人前不准说句话，
    吃饭躲在锅后边。
    政治地位无我份，
    文化生活不用谈。
    我从小就爱唱歌，七岁那年，就在放牛岗上学会了十几个民歌、小调。王家是个封建古板的人家，认为妇女开口就唱，是不光彩的事。有天我在田岗上唱歌，被老公公听见了，这可不得了啦！当面给我一顿臭骂，回去又是一顿毒打，还警告我说：“姑娘家唱歌，成什么体统，如果再听到你唱，就敲掉你的牙”。那时我虽然年纪还小，可也懂得一点事了，看到别人家的亲生儿女那样自由，那样高兴，我呢，一没有娘家，二没有亲人，在王家经常挨打受骂，一肚子苦水向谁去诉呢？只有淌眼泪或唱歌来发散心中的苦闷。老公公不让我唱，我怎能不唱呢，但我再也不敢当人面唱了，只能偷偷地在放牛岗上和田里唱。
    1949年解放大军解放了我们家乡，穷苦人翻了身，好像拨开乌云见到了太阳。有一部分解放军住在我们村里，王书琴、王凤琴等小姑娘都跟解放军学东方红、打得好、三大纪律八项注意等歌子，我心里也想去学，可是我不敢去。有一天我到亲房嫂子家去玩，他们唱的正起劲，我就靠在门口听，班长问我：“小姑娘，他们都在唱，你为什么不唱”。王书琴她们说：“她会唱，唱的好听得很”。解放军同志欢迎我唱，我不唱，大家拍手欢迎，关门不让我走，我就唱了一个“新十二月当兵”，这一唱，可就惹下祸来了，回去后老公公狠狠地骂了我一顿，虽然这次因为村里有解放军没有打我，可是他们不给我饭吃，说我唱饱了。1951年村里办民校，妇女们都去念书，我也去了。没钱买书，教师王绍伦给了我一本旧书，可是公公说：“你念书就出去吧！不准用家里的油。”并说再念，就撕掉我的书，我只念了三个晚上，就不让我念了。
    1954年冬天，县文化馆在我们村试办人民俱乐部，他们又是演戏，又是唱歌跳舞，我再也忍不住了，不让家庭知道，偷偷地去学，从此我每天早些吃晚饭，饭碗一丢，就去学。
    我的创作是从1955年的栽秧季节开始的，开始我还认为：叫我们泥糊腿子搞创作，那不是笑话吗？文化馆的干部说：“只要把你们心里的话说出来，能像秧歌一样的唱出来就可以算是一篇创作了”。有一天在秧田里大家唱老秧歌，我想了几句，就在秧田里唱了出来：
    跳下田来栽秧棵，
    栽秧的人儿爱唱歌，
    栽到稗子棵棵死，
    栽到黄秧都活棵，
    都活棵来都活棵，
    万担归仓收的多，
    增产支援工业化，
    改善生活笑哈哈。
    回家以后我请别人记下来，送给文化馆里的干部看，他们说：“这就是一篇很好的创作”。他们又搜集了作品，印发到全县。
    过去我总觉得我不是人，过着牛马畜牲的生活，解放后我才开始觉得我是一个真正的人，我参加了青年团，出席了省的青年代表会议，妇女代表会议，乡并提名选我为乡妇女代表和人民代表。1956年我在老艺人王绍西的帮助下，又学会唱门歌，因为心情愉快，我的歌声也就特别的响亮，我下田必唱，逢会必唱，从村唱到乡，唱到区，唱到县，大概是因为我唱的多，唱的还好，大家送给我一个“农民歌手”的光荣称号。1957年1月，组织上要我代表大家参加了专区和省的第一届民间音乐舞蹈会演，得到了特等奖的荣誉。谁能想到一个受尽苦难的童养媳，一字不识的农村妇女，会有这样一天啊！我不住的要唱：
    千年铁树开了花，
    四九年成立新国家，
    封建势力全打垮，
    劳动人民坐天下。
    妇女个个翻了身，
    我上冬学学文化。
    去年参加文娱组，
    唱歌跳舞都不怕。
    今年三月入了团，
    各种工作都参加。
    前次妇女选代表，
    叫我来当这个家。
    生产工作我积极干，
    人人都将我来夸。
    感谢共产党救了我，
    推倒头上千层山。
    现在磨出封建关，
    各种工作带头干。
    唱个门歌表心情，
    歌声唱到万人家。
    党领导着我们永远前进，我们的创作像滚滚东流的江水，源源不断。通过实际创作，我们已取得了一些经验并总结成如下几句：
    创作不用怕，大家顺口啦，主题要一个，不能乱生岔。
    语言讲绝了，另调一支花。全部编好了，从头来审查，
    好的留下来，坏的去掉它，修改再修改，最后成功啦！
    我要讲的话是三天三夜也讲不完的，归总一句，我感谢共产党和毛主席培养了我，感谢我周围的同志们扶持了我，使我这个受苦受难的童养媳冲出了封建的牢笼，成了一个真正的人，旧社会逼的我装聋作哑，新社会培养我成了农民的歌唱家，我保证在总路线的光辉照耀下，多多的编、多多的唱，唱得人人争上游，唱的红旗遍地插。
