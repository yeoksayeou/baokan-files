Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 15th: The legendary ancient and mysterious continent of Atlantis did indeed exist. This continent sank to the bottom of the sea around the 15th century BC. This is the conclusion reached by Professor Ledov, a physicist and mathematician in Moscow, based on twenty years of research.

In the descriptions of ancient historians, Atlantis was a land located in the Atlantic Ocean, where a very powerful mythical nation was established. Later, this land, along with its inhabitants, suddenly sank into the sea and disappeared forever.

Professor Ledov used strict logical analysis to analyze ancient historical documents and cultural relics, and compared the obtained data with the latest achievements in natural science. Ledov speculates that Atlantis was a large island stretching for hundreds of kilometers. This island was located west of the Strait of Gibraltar. Around this large island were some smaller islands, extending across the Atlantic Ocean to the American continent.

Professor Ledov believes that the decisive proof explaining the existence of Atlantis is that the seabed terrain west of the Iberian Peninsula almost completely matches the geographical description of Atlantis made by Plato in the fourth century BC based on older materials.

Professor Ledov accurately determined the coordinates of the sunken capital of Atlantis, located in the western part of the ancient island. The scientist determined that the sinking of this group of islands and the destruction of its sixty million inhabitants occurred around the 15th century BC, a period of major geological and climatic changes on Earth.

    “大西洲”之谜揭开
    苏联科学家认为它是公元前十五世纪沉没的
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：阿特兰提斯（大西洲）这个传说中的古代的神秘大陆，的确存在过。这块大陆大约是在公元前十五世纪左右沉入海底的。这是莫斯科物理学家兼数学家列德?夫教授根据自己二十年的研究结果得出的看法。
    在古代历史学家的描述中，阿特兰提斯是一块位于大西洋中的陆地，这里建立了一个非常强盛的神话般的国家，以后这块陆地连同其居民突然沉入海中而从此消失了。
    列德?夫运用严格的逻辑分析方法对古代历史文献和文化古迹进行了分析，并把所获得的资料同最新自然科学成就进行了比较。列德?夫推测，阿特兰提斯是一个长达数百公里的大岛。这个岛位于直布罗陀海峡以西。这个大岛周围还有一些小岛屿，经过大西洋延伸到美洲大陆。
    列德?夫认为，说明阿特兰提斯存在的具有决定意义的证明是，比利牛斯半岛以西地区海底的地势同公元前四世纪柏拉图根据更为古老的材料对阿特兰提斯所做的地理描述几乎完全相符。
    列德?夫教授准确地确定了沉没到海底的位于古岛西部的阿特兰提斯首都的座标。这位科学家测定这一群岛屿的陆沉和岛上六千万居民遭到毁灭的日期大约是公元前十五世纪左右，即地球上地质和气候大变化的时期。
