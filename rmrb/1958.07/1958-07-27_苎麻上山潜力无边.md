Ramie is a crop suitable for planting in hills and mountainous areas. At present, more than 80% of ramie in China is distributed in the hilly and mountainous areas of 14 provinces (regions), including Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Anhui, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Henan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. This does not conflict with grain production, and the average yield per mu is 160 jin, which can be woven into nine bolts of cloth, which is of great significance for enriching textile fiber resources.

The provinces south of the Yangtze River in China have vast mountainous areas. The mountainous areas of only five provinces (regions), Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, are estimated to be more than 30 million mu. Therefore, the potential for developing ramie production is very large.

What kind of mountainous land is suitable for planting ramie? How to plant it? According to local experience, hilly and gentle sloping mountainous land is the best. However, this is not absolute. Ramie can also be planted on mountainous land with slightly larger slopes. In Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and other places, ramie is planted on mountain slopes with gradients of 30 to 40 degrees or more, and it grows well. For example, in Mapozhai Agricultural Cooperative in Jiahe County, Hunan Province, ramie is also planted on mountain land with a slope of 45 degrees. This year's first ramie yield is estimated to reach 120 to 180 jin per mu. Therefore, when developing ramie, we must not be restricted by the slope of the mountainous land. As long as the mountainous land with high slopes is terraced under the principle of not destroying soil and water conservation and being beneficial to management, ramie can be planted. On mountainous land with small slopes, contour planting can be implemented.

In higher and larger mountains, there are also relatively flat hillsides, valleys, and mountain depressions, which are most suitable for planting ramie. Because it can be combined with the forest above to reduce wind damage and increase humidity, creating good conditions for the growth and development of ramie.

Although the soil on barren mountainous land is slightly barren, as long as we take measures to improve the soil and strengthen cultivation management, we can plant and harvest ramie in the same year.

Ramie is a crop suitable for development in mountainous areas, but when ramie is planted uphill in various places, a series of tasks must be done well: such as conducting uphill land planning to prevent ramie from competing with trees for land; combining with the construction of protective forests to do a good job in preventing wind, drought, and insects; as well as doing a good job in soil and water conservation and strengthening technical guidance.

    苎麻上山潜力无边
    苎麻是适于种植在丘陵山地的作物。我国目前80％以上的苎麻是分布在湖南、湖北、四川、江西、广东、广西、贵州、安徽、云南、陕西、河南、福建、浙江、江苏等十四个省（区）的丘陵山区，既不与粮食生产矛盾，而且每亩平均产量以一百六十斤计，可织布九匹，对充裕纺织纤维资源，有重大意义。
    我国长江以南各省，山区辽阔，仅湖南、湖北、江西、广东、广西五个省（区）的山地，据不完全估计就有三千多万亩，因此发展苎麻生产的潜力很大。
    哪种山地可以栽苎麻？怎样栽？根据各地经验，以丘陵山地和缓坡山地最好。但这并不是绝对的，坡度稍大一些的山地，也可栽苎麻。在广东、广西、湖南等地，坡度三十至四十度以上的山坡都栽有苎麻，而且长得并不坏。如湖南省嘉禾县马坡寨农业社四十五度坡度的山地，也都栽了苎麻，今年头麻产量估计每亩可达一百二十到一百八十斤。所以在发展苎麻时，决不可受山地坡度的束缚，只要在不破坏水土保持，及经营上有利的原则下，坡度高的山地修成梯田，就可栽苎麻。坡度小的山地，实行等高栽植就可以。
    较高较大山里，也有较平山腰、山谷、山窝，这些地都最适于栽苎麻。因为可与上面的树林相结合，减轻风害和增加湿度，更为苎麻生长发育创造了良好条件。
    闲荒山地，土壤虽稍瘠薄，只要我们采取改良土壤措施，加强培养管理，当年就可栽麻收麻。
    苎麻是适于向山区发展的作物，但是各地苎麻上山时，必须做好一系列工作：如进行上山土地规划，使苎麻不与林木争地；结合造防护林，做好防风防旱防虫工作，以及做好水土保持，加强技术指导。
