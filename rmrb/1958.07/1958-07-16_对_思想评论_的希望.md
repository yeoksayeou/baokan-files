    Hopes for "Ideological Commentary"
    The "Ideological Commentary" column on the seventh page of the People's Daily has been well-received by readers since its inception. The articles published in this column criticize various forms of bourgeois ideology and provide socialist ideological education to readers, which is helpful for the ideological transformation of intellectuals. For example, the articles published in June, such as "Sweeping Away the Gray Outlook on Life," "Learning to 'Dissect a Sparrow'," and "The Latecomers Surpass the Early Ones," have been very enlightening to me. I request that more articles of this kind be published in the future, and I hope that the articles will not be too long and that the language will be more popular so as to meet the requirements of various readers.

    对“思想评论”的希望
    人民日报第七版的“思想评论”专栏，自增设以来深受读者的欢迎。这一栏刊登的文章批判了形形色色的资产阶级思想，向读者进行了社会主义思想教育，对知识分子的思想改造是有帮助的。如6月份发表的“扫除灰色人生观”、“学会‘解剖一个麻雀’”、“后来者居上”等，对我都很有启发。我要求以后多登这类文章，并希望篇幅不要过长，语言要更通俗些，以满足各种读者的要求。
