Two Thoughts After Seeing "Guan Hanqing"
　　Lin Ling

After seeing the Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance of "Guan Hanqing," I have two thoughts.

First is "artistic cunning."

Guan Hanqing wrote "Dou E's Injustice," a critique of the dark rule of the time. Although Zhu Lianxiu dared to perform it, and pulled her apprentices to play other roles, they didn't have a theater to perform in. Once they had a good theater like Yuxian Lou, they still needed to find a "thick-waisted" owner to book the venue to guarantee the performance of this play that cursed heaven, earth, and the government. So they found the old mother of Chancellor Boyan to book the venue for her birthday celebration. The tears shed by Boyan's old mother, moved by the play, ensured that Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu were not arrested and killed on the spot.

This is the "magic" that dramatic art exerted here. The reason art can break through numerous difficulties and exert its power is precisely because it possesses this magic. Wang Zhu, after watching the play, was so moved that he shouted to eliminate harm for the people, and eventually started an uprising and rebellion, which further illustrates the magnitude of this magic.

When Gao Erji wrote several revolutionary dramas that could not be performed, Niemirovich-Danchenko, who presided over the Moscow Art Theatre, lobbied the powerful figures of the Tsarist government at the time, and through some of the wives of the powerful who "loved drama," he enabled those plays that criticized dark rule and called for revolution to break through the strict censorship system and meet the masses. During the initial performances, even the aristocracy and bourgeoisie frantically squeezed in to "support the show." Niemirovich-Danchenko called this "artistic cunning."

The tortuous story of the performance of "Dou E's Injustice" does not simply tell us "there would be no story without coincidences," but precisely this "artistic cunning."

Second is "noble spirit."

The realistic significance of a historical play depends on whether the struggles in the play can be connected to the people's struggles today. An actor who wants to play a historical figure's struggle well also depends on whether he can organically combine the past struggle with today's struggle. In fact, all the just struggles of our predecessors are preparing for our struggles and our cause today, and are inherited in one continuous line.

With this understanding, we find the people's nature and the excellent revolutionary tradition. The ideal for which Guan Hanqing and Zhu Lianxiu struggled and sacrificed is easily connected to our goals today through historical threads. Therefore, we feel that the images of Guan Hanqing, Zhu Lianxiu, Wang Zhu, and others are close to us.

The play "Guan Hanqing" writes that Wen Tianxiang was unyielding until death, supported by a spirit of righteousness between heaven and earth. Guan Hanqing drew inspiration and strength from him, and he used this to inspire and encourage others. Due to the limitations of historical conditions, Wen Tianxiang could only draw strength from the realization of "leaving a loyal heart to shine in history," but nevertheless, the people's truth or noble spirit still runs through the just struggles of all times, past and present. The play writes that Wang Zhu firmly believed before his execution that "someone will definitely write about my affairs in the future," and Guan Hanqing also said in prison that his death was nothing, "People say that words written in blood are more valuable than words written in ink. Maybe, when we die, our words will be louder," which is the same meaning.

Hundreds or thousands of years ago, the people's warriors, not knowing how we fight for the communist ideal today, were already inspired by the people's justice, guided by the spirit of righteousness between heaven and earth, and preparing for our cause today. They did not take their "death" as a boundary, but tried their best to pass on the "words of the common people" and keep the "righteousness" continuing.

Tian Han's "Guan Hanqing" is a successful historical drama because he wrote about the struggles of his predecessors from a correct historical perspective. The images created by Diao Guangqin, Shu Xiuwen, and other actors of the Beijing People's Art Theatre are vivid and respectable because they organically linked the people's struggle cause of ancient and modern times through historical threads.

    看“关汉卿”后的两点感想
    林陵
    看完了北京人民艺术剧院演出的“关汉卿”，有两点感想。
    第一是“艺术的狡猾”。
    关汉卿写成了抨击当时黑暗统治的“窦娥冤”，虽然有朱帘秀敢演，并由朱帘秀拉她的徒弟们分饰别的角色，但是没有演出的园子；有了玉仙楼那样的好园子，又得找“腰粗”的东家包场，才能保证这出骂天骂地骂官府的戏的演出。于是他们找到了伯颜丞相的老太太为祝寿而包了场。伯颜老太太被戏感动而流下的眼泪又保证了关汉卿和朱帘秀等人没有被当场抓去杀头。
    这是戏剧艺术在这里发挥了自己的“魔力”。艺术所以能冲破重重难关，发挥自己的力量，正在于它具有这种魔力。王著看了戏被激动得高喊为万民除害，后来还终于起义造反，也正可以说明这种魔力的巨大。
    高尔基写了几个革命戏剧无法演出的时候，主持莫斯科艺术剧院的聂米罗维奇·丹钦柯曾活动于当时沙皇政府的权贵之门，通过一些“热爱戏剧”的权贵之妻，使那些抨击黑暗统治、号召革命的戏，冲破严密的检查制度，得以和群众见面，初演时贵族、资产阶级还如醉如狂地挤着去“捧场”。聂米罗维奇·丹钦柯把这称为“艺术的狡猾”。
    “窦娥冤”演出的曲折故事向我们说明的，决不是“无巧不成书”，而正是这种“艺术的狡猾”。
    第二是“浩然正气”。
    一部历史戏的现实意义，取决于戏里的斗争是否能和今天人民的斗争连接起来。一个演员要演好历史人物的斗争，也取决于他是否能把过去的斗争和今天的斗争有机地结合起来。事实上，前人的一切正义斗争，都是为我们今天的斗争、今天的事业做准备的，是一脉相承的。
    在这样的理解之下，我们就找到了人民性，找到了革命的优良传统。关汉卿和朱帘秀他们为之奋斗，为之牺牲的那一理想，通过历史的线索，很容易和我们今天的奋斗目标联系起来。因此，我们才觉得关汉卿、朱帘秀、王著等形象对于我们是亲切的。
    “关汉卿”戏中写到文天祥至死不屈，有一个天地正气在支持着他，关汉卿从他那里得到了启发，得到了力量，他又以此启发别人，鼓舞别人。由于历史条件的限制，文天祥还只能从“留得丹心照汗青”的认识中给自己吸取力量，但是尽管如此，人民真理或浩然正气，还是使上下古今的正义斗争贯串在一起了。戏中写到王著在就义之前坚信“将来一定有人把我的事写上一笔”，关汉卿在狱中也说自己死了不算得什么，“人家说血写的文字比墨写的要贵重，也许，我们死了，我们的话说得更响亮”，就是这个意思。
    几百年几千年前的人民战士，还不知道我们今天怎样为共产主义理想而斗争的时候，他们已被人民的正义所鼓舞，已为天地正气所指导，为我们今天的事业做准备，他们并不以自己的“死”为界限，而是竭力把“老百姓的话”留传下来，使“正气”延续不止。
    田汉的“关汉卿”是一部成功的历史剧，因为他是用正确的历史观点写出了前人的斗争；刁光覃、舒绣文等北京人民艺术剧院的演员塑造的形象是生动可敬的，因为他们把今古的人民斗争事业，用历史的线索有机地连串起来了。
