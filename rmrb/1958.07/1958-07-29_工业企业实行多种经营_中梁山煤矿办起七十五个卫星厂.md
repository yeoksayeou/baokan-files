Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 28th: The Zhongliangshan Coal Mine in Chongqing is comprehensively utilizing various resources of the mine to vigorously establish satellite factories. In the past half month, the coal mine has established seventy-five factories, including steel, aluminum smelting, machinery manufacturing, carbon black, and cement factories, scattered like stars across Zhongliang Mountain. The coal mine plans to gradually develop from low-level to high-level production according to needs in the future, turning Zhongliang Mountain into a comprehensive enterprise mainly producing coal within a few years.

In addition to abundant coal resources, the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine has also discovered more than twenty kinds of minerals such as iron, aluminum, phosphorus, sulfur, vanadium, gas, gypsum, and limestone during geological exploration and capital construction. Recently, the Capital Construction Engineering Company of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine issued a call to the construction workers on the construction site to "comprehensively utilize mine resources," encouraging everyone to vigorously establish satellite factories. The workers are using their spare time to construct, learn, and produce simultaneously, and have quickly produced many products such as steel, iron, aluminum, ammonia, sulfur, and carbon black. In general coal mines, bauxite is discarded as waste rock, but the construction workers of this coal mine learned the indigenous method of aluminum smelting from the Nantong Coal Mine and have used bauxite to smelt alumina. The workers also used indigenous methods to extract phosphate fertilizer and sulfur from phosphate ore and pyrite mixed in coal and rock, and used limestone, clay, and gypsum from the coal mine to mix and produce low-grade cement ranging from 100 to 200.

The underground gas content of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine is very high, and taming the gas problem is an important issue in coal mine construction. Wang Zhizhong, a worker at the South Shaft construction site, went to the Longchang Gas Mine to study for a few days, and when he returned, he used gas to produce carbon black. Now a carbon black factory has been built on the construction site to train workers to expand carbon black production. They have also manufactured gas lamps and gas stoves, and successfully extracted underground gas as fuel. Now the coal mine is further studying how to extract large amounts of underground gas through pipelines, using it to manufacture synthetic rubber and supply it to households. According to calculations by the technical department of the coal mine, if only half of the underground gas is utilized after the north and south mines are put into production, it will be enough for more than two million residents of Chongqing to use gas for lighting and cooking.

While vigorously establishing these satellite factories, the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine is also solving the equipment and raw materials needed for mine construction based on the principle of "making whatever is lacking, relying on self-reliance." The north and south mines are scheduled to be put into production in September and October of this year, respectively, but they lack more than 1,000 tons of equipment. The coal mine party committee called on the workers to learn indigenous methods of steelmaking. After ten days of hard work, two steelmaking plants have now been built on the construction site, and steel has been officially produced. Workers at the machine repair shop have also manufactured mining machinery such as pneumatic picks and pneumatic drills. They plan to produce more than 2,000 tons of steel this year, relying on their own strength to solve the equipment needed for production and capital construction.

    工业企业实行多种经营
    中梁山煤矿办起七十五个卫星厂
    据新华社重庆28日电　重庆中梁山煤矿综合利用矿山各种资源，大办卫星工厂。在最近半个月内，这个煤矿已办起了钢铁、炼铝、机械制造、炭黑、水泥等工厂七十五个，星罗棋布地散布在中梁山上。这个煤矿计划将来根据需要逐步由低级向高级发展，几年之内把中梁山变成一个以生产煤炭为主的综合性企业。
    中梁山煤矿除了蕴藏着丰富的煤炭资源外，在地质勘探和基本建设过程中，还发现有铁、铝、磷、硫磺、矾、瓦斯、石膏、石灰石等二十多种矿产。最近中梁山煤矿基本建设工程公司向工地职工提出了“综合利用矿山资源”的号召，鼓励大家大办卫星工厂。工人们利用业余时间边建设，边学习，边生产，很快就生产出了钢、铁、铝、氨、硫磺、炭黑等许多种产品。在一般煤矿中，铝土贯岩都被当成矸石倒掉了，这个煤矿的建设工人学习南桐煤矿的土法炼铝，已用铝土贯岩炼成了氧化铝。工人们还用土法从混合在煤和岩石中的磷矿和黄铁矿中提出了磷肥和硫磺，并利用煤矿中的石灰石、粘土和石膏混合制成了一百号到二百号的低标号水泥。
    中梁山煤矿井下瓦斯量很大，驯服瓦斯问题是煤矿建设中的一个重要课题。南竖井工地工人王执中到隆昌气矿去学习了几天，回来就利用瓦斯制成了炭黑。现在工地上已建起了炭黑厂，训练工人扩大炭黑生产。他们并且制成了瓦斯灯和瓦斯炉，并成功地将井下瓦斯抽出作为燃料。现在这个煤矿还正在进一步研究用管道将井下瓦斯大量抽出来，利用它制造合成橡胶和供给家庭使用。据这个煤矿的技术部门计算，南北两个矿井投入生产后，井下瓦斯只利用一半，就够重庆市二百多万市民全部用瓦斯点灯和做饭。
    在大办这些卫星工厂的同时，中梁山煤矿还根据“缺啥做啥，自力更生”的原则，解决矿山建设所需要的设备和原材料。南北两个矿井都要提前在今年9、10两个月分别投入生产，但是缺少一千多吨设备。煤矿党委就号召职工学习土法炼钢，经过十天苦战，现在工地上已建起两个炼钢厂，正式炼出了钢。机修厂的工人也制造出了风镐、风钻等矿山机械。他们计划今年要生产二千多吨钢，依靠自己的力量，解决生产和基本建设所需要的设备。
