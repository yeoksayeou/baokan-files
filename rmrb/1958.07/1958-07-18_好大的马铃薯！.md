    What Big Potatoes!
    The largest potato harvested by the Chaping Cooperative of Fenghua Township, Lichuan County, Hubei Province weighed one catty and two liang (approximately 600 grams). These were cultivated in an experimental plot by cooperative director Wang Huitian (a Communist Party member) and cooperative cadre Xiang Chengmei. They planted a total of nine plants, each yielding an average of seven catties and ten liang (approximately 3.8 kg) of potatoes, with each potato weighing an average of twelve liang (approximately 375 grams).
