The Drought, Flood, and Saline-Alkali Resistant
    In the areas south of the Yangtze River in our country, industrious farmers have traditionally cultivated green manure as a base fertilizer for rice paddies. This rich experience is of great significance for improving agricultural production. After liberation, various experimental research institutions in the north also actively carried out green manure cultivation work. The trial planting of Sesbania in the north is one aspect of this work. This experiment began in 1954. According to our four years of observation and experimentation, Sesbania from the southern regions (Nanjing, Fujian, Northern Jiangsu) grows well in the Baoding Hebei Agricultural College, the Beijing Botanical Research Institute, the Baigezhuang Farm in Tangshan, the Junliangcheng Rice Experiment Station, the Lutai Farm, and the Sino-Czech Friendship Farm. Spring-sown Sesbania grows to over three meters tall by late August. From its performance, it is indeed an emerging short-term summer green manure crop in the Bohai area.

    Sesbania is also very salt-tolerant here. According to measurements, it can emerge normally when the soil contains 0.25% soluble salts; it can also emerge at 0.3%. After Sesbania emerges and takes root, its salt-alkali resistance significantly increases, and grown Sesbania can even grow in soil containing 0.4% salt. Because Sesbania has a large number of stems and leaves, it can cover the ground, reduce water evaporation, and also inhibit the rise of salt.

    Sesbania is also very resistant to waterlogging here. As long as it is not submerged during the seedling stage, it can continue to grow even if the water accumulates to 30 centimeters in the later stage for 10 to 20 days without major impact. When it is submerged, its root and stem exterior can grow a kind of sponge-like tissue to adapt to the waterlogged environment, and the leaves close and stand upright. After the water recedes, the leaves then spread out and return to normal. From this point of view, Sesbania is extremely suitable for planting in the spring drought, summer flood, saline-alkali, and low-lying areas of North China.

    Sesbania has a thick taproot and a well-developed root system. In general dry and loose soil, the roots can reach a depth of 250 to 300 centimeters. According to measurements, each mu can produce more than 1,000 jin of fresh grass. In Baoding, Beijing, Junliangcheng and other areas, we sow in late April, and reach full bloom in mid-to-late August, and still bloom a few flowers in early October, and never bear seeds. The Sesbania planted in Baoding and Junliangcheng last year bore a few seeds. How to make Sesbania bear more seeds in Hebei is still a problem to be solved.

    Simple Cultivation Techniques

    According to our observation, the cultivation technology of Sesbania is simple and suitable for mechanical operation. For Sesbania sown on wheat stubble land for green manure, it should be plowed and harrowed before sowing. It can be sown in rows or broadcast. The row spacing of five inches to one foot is the most suitable. The sowing amount is eight to ten jin. Those who leave seeds are best to use mechanical wide row sowing.

    According to our experiments and investigations: whether it is spring sowing and summer harvest (sowing in late April and harvesting in late August) or wheat stubble sowing and autumn harvest (sowing from late June to early July and harvesting in late September), each mu can harvest 3,000 to 4,000 jin of fresh Sesbania grass. Wheat stubble Sesbania only needs 80 days to be cut or plowed. Its green stems and leaves contain 0.52% nitrogen, 0.15% phosphorus, and 0.52% potassium. The weight of 1,000 seeds is 12 to 16 grams. According to the experiment in Junliangcheng: Sesbania harvested 3,140 jin of fresh grass per mu on September 27 when sown on July 8 with early sowing, dense planting, and drought irrigation cultivation techniques; the yield of fresh grass per mu was 2,639 jin when sown on July 17; while the yield per mu was 1,257 jin when sown on August 7, a reduction of about 50%. Some experiments have also shown that irrigation and no irrigation have a great impact on the growth of Sesbania in dry conditions. For example, the yield of 3,754 jin (per mu) irrigated on July 28 sown on July 8 was 606 jin more than that of no irrigation.

    High Fertilizer Efficiency and Large Yield Increase

    The fertilizer effect of Sesbania planted in this area is very high. In the spring of 1957, we chopped the Sesbania into compost, and applied 1,400 jin to each mu of rice field. As a result, each mu yielded 236 jin more than that of not applying, an increase of 25.5%. If the tender branches and leaves of Sesbania are used, they can be cut and chopped to make silage, which can be mixed with rice bran to feed pigs. If the branches and leaves are fed to sheep, the feeding effect is also good.

    According to our comparative observation, in the Sesbania planting area after wheat, there are only 2.2 plants of barnyard grass and 3.3 plants of drought grass per square meter, and none of them have tasseled. This is mainly because Sesbania has dense sowing and many seedlings, and the initial growth is rapid, so weeds cannot get enough sunshine and nutrients, so growth is inhibited. This method has opened up a new way to eliminate weeds for direct-seeding rice cultivation.

### 北方新培植的绿肥作物——“田菁”

    北方新培植的绿肥作物——“田菁”
    孙醒东　汪植琼
    不怕旱涝盐碱
    在我国长江以南地区，勤劳的农民历来有种植绿肥作稻田基肥的习惯。这一丰富经验对提高农业生产具有巨大的意义。解放后，北方各试验研究机构也都积极开展了绿肥的种植工作。在北方试种田菁就是这方面工作的一项。这项试验是从1954年开始的。根据我们四年来的观察试验，南方地区（南京、福建、苏北）的田菁在保定河北农学院，北京植物研究所，唐山柏各庄农场，军粮城水稻试验站、芦台农场和中捷友谊农场都生长良好。春播的田菁到8月下旬，生长达三公尺多高。从它的表现来看，确是渤海区的新兴夏季短期绿肥作物。
    田菁在这里也是很耐盐的，经测定，土壤含可溶性盐分在0.25％时，可以正常出苗；在0.3％时，也能出苗。当田菁出苗扎根以后，它的耐盐碱性就显著提高，成长起来的田菁甚至可以在含盐分0.4％的土壤里生长。由于田菁茎叶较多，可以遮盖地面减少水分蒸发，还能起到抑制盐分上升的作用。
    田菁在这里的耐涝性也是很强的，只要在苗期不遭没顶，后期虽然积水达三十厘米，经十到二十天仍能继续生长，没有重大影响。当在被水浸淹时，它的根茎外部能生长一种海绵体来适应水涝的环境，叶片闭合而直立，待水退了以后，叶片随即散开，恢复正常。从这一点看，田菁在华北地区的春旱、夏涝、盐碱、低洼地种植，极为适合。
    田菁主根肥大，根群很发达，在一般干燥疏松土壤中，根深可达二百五十到三百厘米，经测定每亩可产鲜草一千斤以上。在保定、北京、军粮城等地区我们在4月下旬播种，8月中下旬即达盛花期，到10月上旬仍开少数花，始终不能结籽。去年在保定和军粮城种的田菁曾结少数籽，如何使田菁在河北多结籽，还是一个有待解决的问题。
    栽培技术简单
    据我们观察，田菁的栽培技术简单，并且适于机械作业。在麦茬地上播种作绿肥用田菁，应先耕耙后播种，可条播也可撒播。播种行距以五寸到一尺为最合适。播种量八到十斤。留种用者最好采用机械宽行条播。
    根据我们的试验和调查：不拘是春播夏收（4月下旬播，8月下旬收）或麦茬播秋收（6月下旬至7月初播，9月下旬收），每亩可收田菁鲜草三千到四千斤。麦茬田菁仅需八十天，就可刈割或翻耕。它的青茎叶含氮量0.52％，含磷0.15％，含钾0.52％，种籽千粒重十二到十六克。另据军粮城的试验：田菁在采用早播、密植、天旱灌水的栽培技术情况下，7月8日播的，9月27日每亩收获鲜草三千一百四十斤；7月17日播的亩产鲜草二千六百三十九斤；而8月7日播的则亩产一千二百五十七斤，减低约50％。从一些试验中还表明，在干旱的情况下灌水和不灌水对田菁的生长影响很大。如7月8日播种，7月28日灌水的产量三千七百五十四斤（亩）比不灌水的增产六百零六斤。
    肥效高增产大
    在这一带种植的田菁的肥效很高。1957年春我们把田菁切碎沤制堆肥，每亩稻田施入一千四百斤，结果：施比不施的每亩多收二百三十六斤多，增产25.5％。如利用田菁的嫩枝叶，刈割切碎来作青贮，可混合米糠喂猪。如将枝叶喂羊，饲养效果也好。
    经我们对比观察，在麦后播田菁区中，每平方米仅有稗草二点二株，旱草三点三株，都没有抽穗。这主要是田菁密播苗多，初期生长迅速，杂草无法获得充分的阳光和养分，因而生长受到抑制。这种作法给水稻旱直播栽培消灭杂草开辟了新的途径。
