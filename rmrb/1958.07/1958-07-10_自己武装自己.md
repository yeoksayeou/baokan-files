Arm Ourselves

    Striving to transform the backward handicraft industry to a modern technical foundation within two to three years is a major task in China's technological revolution. China's handicraft industry has always been a supplier of means of production and means of subsistence for the rural areas. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, more than 500 million peasants have launched an increasingly high-spirited production upsurge with an overwhelming momentum. With the great leap forward in agricultural production, the calls for modern farm tools, modern power equipment, irrigation and drainage equipment, and improved and modern transportation tools are becoming more and more urgent. After the large-scale establishment of industries in counties and townships, they also reach out to the handicraft industry for some equipment. The products produced in the past will gradually become unsuitable, and new, complex products are forcing handicraftsmen to make them. At present, a sharp contradiction has arisen between the people's needs and the backward productive forces of the handicraft industry. How to solve this contradiction? The fundamental solution is to transition to a new technical foundation in an organized and planned way, to the technical foundation of modern large-scale production, and to use machines for all labor that can be mechanized, except for the necessary manual labor. This requires launching a vigorous technological revolution in handicraft cooperatives.

    The key to carrying out the technological revolution in the handicraft industry is no longer the question of whether to "revolutionize" or not, but how to "revolutionize." On this issue, there are now two different schools of thought. One can be called the self-reliance faction, which represents the correct view of the vast majority of people; the other can be called the handout faction, which represents the erroneous view of a minority of people. For example, in terms of equipment sources, the correct view is to manufacture it yourself and arm yourself; while the handout faction advocates asking large industries and the state for it. On the standard of mechanization, the correct view is to proceed from reality, from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, from simple to complex, and from imperfect to perfect, and gradually improve; the handout faction advocates that if we don't do it, we don't do it, but if we do it, we must do it big and new. On the source of funds and technical strength, the correct view is to solve it yourself; the handout faction advocates that the state should solve it.

    Our country is in a great historical period of overall great leap forward. The upsurge of the whole Party and the whole people running industries has already appeared. Equipment, funds, and technical strength are needed everywhere, but China's current large-scale industry cannot meet the requirements of every corner of the country, and funds and technical strength are not yet so abundant. It is clearly unrealistic to rely entirely on the state to allocate equipment, supply funds, and provide technical strength to arm more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives. The masses possess inexhaustible wisdom and strength. As long as we are good at tapping them, they will erupt like a volcano, and all the great difficulties will be overcome, and miracles will appear. However, the eyes of the "handout" faction only look upward, not at the masses, and do not rely on the masses. Following the propositions of the "handout" faction will inevitably turn the originally vigorous mass technological revolution movement into a lifeless and cold one, and the result will certainly not be more, faster, better, and more economical, but less, slower, worse, and more expensive.

    The line of self-reliance is a line that truly relies on the masses, mobilizes the masses to boost their energy, strives for the upper reaches, and vigorously launches the technological revolution movement. Through mass tool improvement and technological transformation movements, relying on our own efforts to gradually shift from manual operation to the basis of modern technology, so that mechanization, semi-mechanization, and necessary manual labor are combined, and we must also innovate product varieties, improve product quality, and increase product quantity, to more powerfully promote the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production and construction. The line of self-reliance truly conforms to the spirit of the general line of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    Can handicraft cooperatives manufacture their own equipment and arm themselves? The handout faction believes that they cannot. They cite some foreign materials, insisting that if modern industry does not manufacture equipment, the handicraft industry cannot be transformed to a modern technical foundation. Of course, in some modern industrialized countries, it is a fact that they equip the handicraft industry with equipment replaced by large industries. In China, there are also a very small number of handicraft cooperatives that are equipped with old equipment from large industries, and a small number of handicraft cooperatives will continue to do so in the future. However, this does not prove that the handicraft industry cannot manufacture modern equipment and cannot arm itself. If the handicraft industry cannot manufacture modern equipment, then where did the first batch of modern machines in the world come from? Were they bestowed by "God"? I'm afraid even devout Christians wouldn't believe it! History cannot be severed; modern machine industry has developed from the basis of the handicraft industry. This is an iron fact.

    Now China has more than five million handicraft workers, of whom tens of thousands have rich technical experience. Encouraged by the Party's general line for building socialism, they have created many amazing miracles. Many handicraft cooperative members have realized mechanized or semi-mechanized production after three or two months, or more than twenty days of hard work. Many handicraft cooperatives have successfully trial-produced modern products with relatively complex technology, some of which are still rare in the country. The 2050-type six-foot stepless transmission lathe successfully trial-produced by the experimental cooperative factory of the Zhejiang Provincial Handicraft Federation is one example. The members of the Red Flag Ironworks in Dalian, with their own hands and wisdom in a short period of time, created more than two hundred kinds of tools and manufactured fourteen kinds of modern equipment such as iron smelting furnaces, blowers, and universal lathes. They themselves have stepped onto the steed of mechanized production, and still have the strength to arm brother societies and the industries of special districts and counties. In the country, there are currently more than two thousand cooperatives and cooperative factories like the Red Flag Ironworks that have achieved mechanized production or semi-mechanized production, with more than 50,000 machine tools of various types. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Beijing, Guangzhou and other provinces and cities, more than 15,000 various machine tools will be produced this year, of which the Weifang No. 1 Iron Production Cooperative in Shandong will produce 1,000 units. China's handicraft industry has so much equipment, so many hardworking, brave and intelligent workers, and the correct leadership of the Party. It is fully capable of manufacturing modern equipment and arming itself.

    Should the technological revolution of the handicraft industry advance in all aspects at the same time, or should it be carried out with emphasis? The answer is that it should advance in all aspects at the same time, and it should be carried out with emphasis. The technological revolution is required for the development of production, and it is also the urgent demand of more than five million handicraft workers. In order to use machines wherever machines can be used, in order to improve labor productivity, everyone should take active action, contribute ideas, and improve tools and reform technology. In this sense, the technological revolution should advance in all aspects at the same time. However, the technological revolution is like people walking. There is always one foot that goes out first, and then the other foot catches up; if both feet go out at the same time, it is impossible to walk fast and far. Therefore, whether viewed from a society, a region, or the whole country, the technological revolution must have steps, that is, it should have emphasis, urgency, and order. From the perspective of a society, the leadership should first focus on the backward links in production and the particularly heavy manual labor processes, improve their tools and equipment, so that they can keep up with the advanced links or processes, and combine the technological revolution with the completion of the current production tasks. From the perspective of a region or from the national scope, we should first arm the industries that produce means of production with limited equipment, manpower and funds. Because only when the means of production develop first can we ensure the continuous expansion of reproduction.

    The so-called industries that produce means of production are steel, iron, coal, copper, machinery, electricity, wood and other industries. Steel, iron, coal, copper, etc. are the grain of industry. When there is enough grain, the processing and manufacturing industries can be full. Machinery, electricity, wood and other industries are the backbone of manufacturing agricultural machinery and industrial equipment. Equipping them first can better serve agricultural production and local industrial construction, and at the same time can manufacture modern equipment for the handicraft industry itself. Therefore, the National Handicraft Cooperative Technological Revolution Conference held in Beijing from June 20 to 23 decided on the steps of the handicraft industry's technological revolution. The first is to build raw material bases on a large scale, and strive for the national handicraft system to produce 3 million tons to 5 million tons of gray pig iron in 1959, and develop small steel plants on this basis. The second is to take the machinery, electricity, iron, and wood industries as the lead, and focus on equipping the cooperatives (factories) with better conditions in these four industries, especially those cooperatives (factories) that can produce various machine tools and power machinery. This is to cultivate "hens" first, and then let the "hens" hatch "chicks," and the "chicks" then become "hens" and hatch "chicks" again. If we work hard for two or three years, China's handicraft cooperatives (factories) can basically ride on the steed of mechanization and gallop.

    In the cooperative system, there are self-reliance factions and handout factions; there are those who strive for the upper reaches, and there are those who are content with being in the middle or even downstream; there are those who dare to think, dare to do, and dare to be original, and there are those who underestimate themselves; there are those who are full of confidence, and there are those who are worried. The contradiction between them is objective, so the struggle also exists. Party organizations should educate members and cadres on the general line of socialist construction, establish advanced banners, shout loudly for new things, help the masses break superstitions, cut off feelings of inferiority, and promote the communist spirit of not being afraid of heaven, not being afraid of earth, daring to think, daring to do, and daring to be original.

    Handicraft workers, the great bugle of the technological revolution has long been sounded, the direction is set, the line is set, and the steps are set. Now it all depends on everyone to boost their energy, work hard and practically!

    自己武装自己
    争取在两三年内把落后的手工业生产转到现代技术基础上来，是我国技术革命中的一个重大任务。我国手工业历来都是农村生产资料和生活资料的供应者。五亿多农民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光芒照耀下，以排山倒海的气势掀起了日益高涨的生产高潮。随着农业生产的大跃进，要现代农具，要现代动力设备，要排灌设备，要改良的和现代的交通运输工具的呼声越来越迫切。县县乡乡大办工业以后，也伸手向手工业要一部分设备。过去生产的产品将逐渐不适用了，新的复杂的产品正在强迫手工业者去做。目前人民的需要和手工业落后的生产力发生了尖锐的矛盾。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？根本的办法，就是在组织起来的基础上，有计划有步骤地转到新的技术基础上来，转到现代大生产的技术基础上来，除了必要的手工劳动以外使一切能够用机器的劳动都使用机器。这就要在手工业合作社中普遍地掀起一个轰轰烈烈的技术革命。
    在手工业中进行技术革命的关键，现在已经不是“革”不“革”的问题，而是怎样“革”的问题。对于这个问题，现在有两派不同的主张。一派可以叫做自力更生派，这是代表最大多数人的正确主张；另一派可以叫做伸手派，这是代表少数人的错误主张。比如，在设备来源上，正确的主张是自己动手制造，自己武装自己；而伸手派却主张向大工业要，向国家要。在机械化的标准上，正确的主张是从实际出发，从小到大，从土到洋，从简单到复杂，从不完善到完善，逐步提高；伸手派则主张不搞则已，要搞就得搞大的、新的。在资金和技术力量的来源上，正确的主张是自己解决；伸手派则主张由国家解决。
    我们的国家正处在全面大跃进的伟大历史时期，全党全民办工业的高潮已经出现，处处需要设备，处处需要资金，处处需要技术力量，而我国目前的大工业还不可能满足全国每一个角落的要求，资金和技术力量也还不那样充裕。完全依靠国家调拨设备、供给资金和技术力量来武装十万多手工业合作社，显然是不现实的。群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和力量，只要我们善于发掘，它们就会像火山一样爆发出来，天大的困难都会被战胜，奇迹就会出现。但是，“伸手”派的眼睛只向上，不看群众，不依靠群众。按照“伸手”派的主张去做，一定会把本来是轰轰烈烈的群众性的技术革命运动，弄得死气沉沉，冷冷清清，其结果一定不是多、快、好、省，而是少、慢、差、费。
    自力更生的路线是一条真正依靠群众、动员群众鼓起干劲、力争上游，轰轰烈烈地开展技术革命运动的路线。通过群众性的改良工具和技术改革运动，依靠自己的努力逐步从手工操作转移到现代技术的基础上来，使机械化、半机械化和必要的手工劳动相结合，并且还要革新产品品种，提高产品质量，增加产品数量，更有力地推动工农业生产和建设的跃进。自力更生的路线是真正符合多、快、好、省的总路线精神的。
    手工业合作社能不能自己制造设备，自己武装自己呢？伸手派认为是不能的。他们引用一些外国资料，硬说现代工业不给制造设备，手工业就不可能转到现代技术的基础上来。当然，有些现代工业很发达的国家，用大工业替换下来的设备装备手工业，这是事实。在我国，现在也有极小部分手工业合作社用大工业的旧设备装备起来的，今后也还会有一小部分手工业合作社这样做。但是，这并不能证明手工业不能制造现代设备，不能自己武装自己。如果手工业不能制造现代设备，那末，世界上出现的第一批现代机器是从哪里来的呢？难道是“上帝”赐予的吗？这恐怕连虔诚的基督徒也不会相信！历史不能割断，现代机器工业是从手工业的基础上发展起来的，这是铁的事实。
    现在我国有五百多万手工业工人，其中具有丰富的技术经验的人数以千、万计。在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，他们创造了许多惊人的奇迹。不少手工业合作社社员经过三几个月或者二十多天的奋战，就实现了机械化或半机械化生产。许多手工业合作社试制成功了技术比较复杂的现代产品，其中有些在国内还是少有的。浙江省手工业联社实验合作工厂试制成功的2050型六呎无级传动螺丝车床，就是一例。旅大市红旗铁工社社员，在短期内凭自己的双手和智慧，创造了二百多种工具，制造了熔铁炉、鼓风机和万能车床等十四种现代设备。他们自己跨上了机械化生产的骏马，还有余力武装兄弟社和专区、县的工业。在全国，像红旗铁工社一样实现了机械化生产或半机械化生产的合作社和合作工厂，目前已有二千多个，拥有各种机床五万多台。据山东、安徽、黑龙江、浙江、江西、北京、广州等省市的不完全统计，今年生产的各种机床将达一万五千多台，其中山东潍坊第一铁工生产合作社，就将生产一千台。我国手工业拥有这么多的设备，拥有这么多的勤劳、勇敢而聪明的工人，又有党的正确领导，完全能够自己制造现代设备，自己武装自己。
    手工业的技术革命，是应该从各方面齐头并进呢，还是要有重点地进行？答复是又要齐头并进，又要有重点。技术革命是生产发展所需要，也是五百多万手工业工人的迫切要求。为了使一切能够使用机器的地方都使用机器，为了提高劳动生产率，每一个人都应积极行动起来，献计献策，动手改进工具，改革技术。从这个意义上说，技术革命是应该从各方面齐头并进的。但是，技术革命和人走路一样，总有一只脚先迈出去，另一只脚再赶上来；两只脚同时迈出去，是决不能走得快，走得远的。所以，不论是从一个社、一个地区或者全国来看，技术革命就得有个步骤，也就是应该有重点、有缓急和先后之分。从一个社来说，领导的力量就应该先抓生产上的落后环节和体力劳动特别繁重的工序，改进它们的工具和设备，使它们向先进环节或工序看齐，把技术革命和完成当前的生产任务结合起来。从一个地区或者从全国范围来看，应该首先把有限的设备、人力和资金武装生产生产资料的行业。因为只有生产资料首先发展起来，才能保证不断地扩大再生产。
    所谓生产生产资料的行业，就是钢、铁、煤、铜和机、电、木等业。钢、铁、煤、铜等是工业的粮食，粮食足，加工制造行业才能吃得饱。机、电、木等业，是制造农业机械、工业设备的骨干，首先把它们装备起来，就可以更好地为农业生产和地方工业建设服务，同时又可以为手工业本身制造现代设备。所以，6月20日至23日在北京召开的全国手工业合作社技术革命会议决定手工业技术革命的步骤，一是大搞原料基地，争取1959年全国手工业系统能够生产灰生铁三百万吨到五百万吨，并在这个基础上发展小型炼钢厂。二是以机、电、铁、木行业带头，重点装备这四个行业中条件比较好的合作社
  （厂），特别是那些能够生产各种工作母机和动力机械的合作社（厂）。这就是先培养“母鸡”，然后让“母鸡”孵“小鸡”，“小鸡”再变成“母鸡”，再孵“小鸡”。这样大干苦干两三年，我国手工业合作社（厂），就可以基本上骑上机械化的骏马飞奔了。
    在合作社系统中，有自力更生派，也有伸手派；有力争上游的人，也有甘居中游甚至下游的人；有敢想、敢干、敢独创的人，也有妄自菲薄的人；有充满着信心的人，也有忧心忡忡的人。他们之间的矛盾是客观存在的，因此斗争也是存在的。党的组织应该对社员和干部进行社会主义建设总路线的教育，树立先进旗帜，为新生事物大叫大喊，帮助群众破除迷信，砍掉自卑感，发扬天不怕、地不怕、敢想、敢干、敢独创的共产主义精神。
    手工业工人们，技术革命的伟大号角早已响了，方向有了，路线有了，步骤也有了，现在全靠大家鼓足干劲，大干苦干踏实地干了！
