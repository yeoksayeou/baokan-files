    Small First, Then Big; Indigenous First, Then Foreign
    In the situation where local iron and steel industries are being developed on a large scale throughout the country, the construction of iron ore mines must catch up at the highest speed. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held an on-site meeting in Handan, proposing a three-year hard work effort to achieve an annual iron ore output of more than 200 million tons nationwide. This is a Great Leap Forward plan, a magnificent plan, worthy of deep celebration.
    How to achieve this goal? The most important thing is to rely on the masses and tap local potential. For this reason, we must eliminate the thinking of favoring "big" and liking "foreign," and implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small scales. Recently, many localities have put forward the policy of combining large and small, starting from small to large, and developing large from small and medium; indigenous first, then foreign; combining indigenous and foreign, and developing foreign from indigenous. This is in line with the dialectical development of things and is entirely correct. Under this policy, the work of building iron ore mines will leap forward. Dengfeng in Henan and Handan in Hebei have already set an example. We firmly believe that their experience will soon blossom and bear fruit across the country.

    先小后大　先土后洋
    在各地大办地方钢铁工业的形势下，铁矿山的建设必须以最高速度迎头赶上。冶金工业部在邯郸召开了现场会议，提出了苦干三年，使全国铁矿石年产量达到两亿吨以上的奋斗目标。这是一个大跃进的计划，宏伟的计划，值得深深庆贺。
    怎样实现这个目标呢？最主要的是依靠群众，发挥地方潜力。为此就必须破除好“大”喜“洋”的思想，贯彻大中小并举的方针。最近，不少地方提出了大小结合、从小到大、小中出大，先土后洋、土洋结合、土中出洋的方针。这是合乎事物的辩证发展的，也是完全正确的。建设铁矿山的工作，在这一方针下，必将飞跃前进。河南登封和河北邯郸两县已经作出了榜样，我们深信，他们的经验很快就会在全国开花结果。
