Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: The Second Congress of Heroes and Model Workers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly opened here this morning. More than 450 heroes and model workers selected from the Vietnamese People's Army, workers, peasants, and intellectuals attended the congress.

The venue, located at the Hanoi Labor Club, was decorated with solemn beauty. When leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party and government, led by President Ho Chi Minh, entered the venue, a storm of applause erupted.

The presidium of the congress consisted of party and government leaders such as Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Truong Chinh, Phan Ke Toai, and more than ten heroes and model workers.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a report amidst cheers from the audience. In his report, Pham Van Dong said that this congress would summarize the brilliant achievements of heroes and model workers in the past three years of struggle to restore the national economy and promote the active construction of socialism by the broad masses of the people.

Pham Van Dong listed facts to describe the achievements of the Vietnamese people in the past three years in the competition movements on various fronts. He said that thousands of advanced workers and model workers had emerged in the competition movement, and many heroes and tens of thousands of model soldiers had also emerged in the army building work of the People's Army. He called on the Vietnamese people to learn from the hardworking spirit of heroes and model workers.

In his speech, Pham Van Dong expressed his respect for the spirit of the people in South Vietnam who are resolutely fighting against American interference and Ngo Dinh Diem's tyranny, and expressed his gratitude to the fraternal countries for their selfless assistance to Vietnam.

In his report, Pham Van Dong emphasized that the current competition movement carried out by Vietnam on various fronts is a further development based on the changes that have taken place in the past patriotic competition movement in economic and political aspects. The slogan "Competition is patriotism, patriotism requires competition" put forward by President Ho Chi Minh in 1948 still has practical significance. The basis for carrying out this kind of competition is the Vietnamese people's strong patriotism and socialist labor enthusiasm.

Pham Van Dong pointed out that the Vietnamese people are carrying out production competition in order to complete the national plan in a faster, better, and more economical way. In the process of carrying out competition, attention must be paid to improving technology and labor organization, and the two must advance side by side. He said that improving technology is very important. In Vietnam's current situation, on the one hand, machines should be used appropriately; on the other hand, human labor should be used as much as possible.

When talking about the future tasks of the People's Army, Pham Van Dong said that regularizing the People's Army is a major process of military reform. He asked the Vietnamese People's Army to redouble its efforts to complete their military tasks and actively participate in production and construction.

In his report, Pham Van Dong asked heroes and model workers to believe in the infinite creative ability of the masses, oppose conservatism, strive for progress, and work together with the people to build a beautiful socialist North.

Pham Van Dong said that the first Congress of Heroes and Model Workers held in 1952 inspired the Vietnamese people to achieve the victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign and the liberation of the North. This congress will inspire the Vietnamese people to achieve great victories in socialist construction.

Nguyen Van Tao, Minister of Labor of Vietnam, announced at the meeting that the Vietnamese government had decided to award the title of "Labor Hero" to twenty-six outstanding workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Among them, five are cadres who gathered in the North from the South, and there are also five women, two minority cadres, and one overseas Chinese. Sixteen of these twenty-six "Labor Heroes" are members of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

Also participating in today's conference were ministers of various ministries of the Vietnamese government, representatives of various organizations, and representatives of experts from fraternal countries stationed in Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and President Ho Chi Minh held a tea party at the Presidential Palace this evening to entertain more than 400 advanced workers, peasants, and soldiers attending the Second Congress of Heroes and Model Workers of Vietnam.

President Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, expressed warm congratulations to the heroes and model workers.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the number of heroes and model workers in our country is increasing, which proves that the Vietnamese people are constantly progressing. He said that in the past, Vietnam did not have female labor heroes, but now there are five, which proves that under the social system in North Vietnam, men and women are truly equal. In the ranks of heroes, there are also cadres who gathered in the North from the South, demobilized soldiers, and family members of martyrs, which shows that they actively participated in the socialist construction of North Vietnam; in addition, there are overseas Chinese from fraternal countries, which illustrates the internationalist spirit of the working class.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the patriotic competition movement in North Vietnam is developing more and more widely because the working people in North Vietnam have truly become the masters, because Vietnam is a member of the socialist family, and has received selfless assistance from fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China.

President Ho Chi Minh called on heroes and model workers to work hard to learn from the experience of China's competition movement, strive to catch up with China, and then catch up with the Soviet Union.

President Ho Chi Minh also cited many specific examples in China's industry and agriculture to introduce the situation of China's Great Leap Forward to the heroes and model workers.

President Ho Chi Minh called on the Vietnamese people to catch up with the advanced, and also asked the heroes and model workers not to be complacent and to advance forever. He said that only in this way can more heroes and model workers continue to emerge, and can we achieve victory in gradually moving towards socialism and in the struggle to unify the motherland.

President Ho Chi Minh's speech was met with prolonged applause and cheers.

President Ho Chi Minh presented each labor hero and army hero with a fountain pen at the meeting.

    鼓舞越南人民建设社会主义的热情
    越南英雄模范代表大会开幕
    胡志明主席勉励英雄模范们永远前进
    新华社河内7日电  越南民主共和国第二次英雄模范代表大会今天上午在这里隆重开幕。四百五十多名由越南人民军、工人、农民和知识分子中选出的英雄、模范出席了大会。
    设在河内劳动俱乐部的会场装饰得庄严、美丽。当以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和政府的领导人进入会场时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    大会主席团由胡志明、范文同、武元甲、长征、潘继遂等党和政府的领导人以及十多位英雄、模范组成。
    范文同总理在全场的欢呼声中作了报告。范文同在报告中说，这次大会要总结英雄、模范们在过去三年恢复国民经济的斗争中所取得的光辉成就，推动广大人民积极建设社会主义。
    范文同列举事实叙述了三年来越南人民在各个战线的竞赛运动中所取得的成就。他说，在竞赛运动中涌现了成千上万的先进工作者和模范；在人民军的军队建设工作中也涌现了许多英雄和上万名模范战士。他号召越南人民学习英雄、模范们的苦干精神。
    范文同在讲话中对越南南方同胞为反对美国干涉和吴庭艳暴政进行坚决斗争的精神表示敬意，并且对兄弟国家给予越南的无私援助表示感谢。
    范文同在报告中着重指出，当前越南在各个战线上开展的竞赛运动是过去的爱国竞赛运动在经济、政治等方面已经发生变化的基础上的进一步发展。胡志明主席在1948年提出的“竞赛就是爱国，爱国就要竞赛”的口号仍然具有现实意义。开展这种竞赛的基础是越南人民强烈的爱国心和社会主义的劳动热情。
    范文同指出，越南人民开展生产竞赛，是为了多快好省地完成国家计划。在开展竞赛的过程中必须注意改进技术和劳动组织，两者齐头并进。他说，改进技术很重要。而在越南目前的情况下，一方面要适当使用机器；另一方面要尽量使用人力。
    范文同在谈到人民军今后的任务时说，使人民军正规化是一个重大的军事改革的过程。他要求越南人民军加倍努力，来完成他们的军事任务和积极参加生产建设。
    范文同在报告中要求英雄、模范们相信群众无穷的创造能力，反对保守，力求进步，同人民群众一起拿出干劲来，建设一个美好的社会主义的北方。
    范文同说，在1952年举行的第一次英雄模范代表大会鼓舞越南人民取得了奠边府战役的胜利和北方的解放，这次大会则将鼓舞越南人民在社会主义建设中取得伟大的胜利。
    越南劳动部部长阮文造在会上宣布，越南政府决定授予二十六位杰出的工人、农民和知识分子以“劳动英雄”的称号。他们当中有五人是从南方集结到北方的干部，还有五位妇女、两位少数民族干部和一名华侨。这二十六位“劳动英雄”中有十六位是越南劳动党的党员。
    参加今天大会的还有越南政府的各部部长、各团体的代表和兄弟国家驻越南专家的代表。
    新华社河内7日电  越南劳动党中央越南政府和胡志明主席今天晚上在主席府举行茶会，招待出席越南第二次英雄模范代表大会的四百多名工农兵先进人物。
    胡志明主席代表越南劳动党和政府向英雄模范们表示热烈的祝贺。
    胡志明主席说，我们国家的英雄模范越来越多，这证明越南人民正在不断进步。他说，过去越南没有女劳动英雄，现在有了五名，这证明在越南北方的社会制度下，男女真正平等。在英雄行列里还有从南方集结到北方来的干部，有复员军人和烈士家属，这表明他们积极参加了越南北方的社会主义建设；此外，还有兄弟国家的侨民，这说明了劳动阶级的国际主义精神。
    胡志明主席说，越南北方的爱国主义竞赛运动日益广泛发展，因为越南北方的劳动人民已经真正作了主人，因为越南是社会主义大家庭中的一员，而且得到了兄弟国家、首先是苏联和中国的无私援助。
    胡志明主席号召英雄模范们努力学习中国竞赛运动的经验，努力赶上中国，然后赶上苏联。
    胡志明主席还列举中国工农业方面的许多具体事例向英雄模范们介绍了中国大跃进的情况。
    胡志明主席号召越南人民赶先进，也要求英雄模范们不要自满、永远前进。他说，只有这样才能不断地涌现出更多的英雄和模范、才能在逐步走向社会主义和在统一祖国的斗争中取得胜利。
    胡志明主席的讲话获得了长时间的鼓掌和欢呼。
    胡志明主席在会上赠给劳动英雄和军队英雄们每人一枝自来水笔。
