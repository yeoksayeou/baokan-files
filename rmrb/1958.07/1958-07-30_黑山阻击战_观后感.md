    Impressions of "Battle of Black Mountain"
    Wang Dizi
      "Battle of Black Mountain" is a military-themed work with a certain degree of historical authenticity. It reflects one aspect of the Liaoxi Campaign, which was of great significance.
    In the autumn of 1948, our Northeast People's Liberation Army launched the autumn offensive, moving from North Manchuria to western Liaoning, and captured Jinzhou with lightning speed. Subsequently, the Kuomintang troops besieged in Changchun were also forced to revolt and surrender. Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to accept his defeat in the Northeast and attempted a desperate struggle. He personally went to Shenyang to organize more than 100,000 troops to launch an all-out attack, attempting to recapture the strategic point of Jinzhou in order to restore the Liaobei-Beiping line and connect with the enemy inside the pass. One column of our Northeast People's Liberation Army, in order to cover the main force's advance towards the Liaohe Plain and completely annihilate the enemy, engaged in a difficult and fierce blocking battle with the enemy at Black Mountain. The film "Battle of Black Mountain" depicts this battle.
    This column was extremely resolute in carrying out its mission. In the cold October weather of the Northeast, the soldiers were unable to wear cotton-padded clothes, and their hands were so frozen that they could not even pull the rifle bolts; however, they still held fast to Height 101, fighting tenaciously, and finally achieved victory and completed the blocking mission.
    From the film, we see the arduousness and tenacity of the Northeast Liberation War, understand the local situation of the Battle of Black Mountain, and also recognize the essence of the People's Army with a high degree of revolutionary optimism and patriotism. The depiction of lower-level commanders and soldiers is relatively detailed. For example, the company commander Wang Hailong, although he does not have many scenes, leaves a vivid impression. He was seriously injured in battle, but he continued to fight. When he led his company to counterattack the enemy with bandages wrapped around his head, enduring the pain, people were deeply moved. Another example is Xiao Liu, the young and lively orderly of the column commander. His care for the commander was so meticulous, from eating to fighting, he was always by the commander's side; and when he accompanied the commander to the front line and shells attacked, endangering the commander's safety, he used his young life to protect the commander. From this character, we can also touch the lofty and selfless spirit of the people's soldiers. However, the film's depiction of senior commanders is relatively simple, and some of the plot arrangements are still worth studying. For example, the column commander's practice of leaving the command post and going to the front line because Height 101 was lost is not appropriate. The demeanor and understanding level of Division Commander Lei are also portrayed as somewhat low. In addition, the love affair between the commander and the female doctor inserted in the film seems very awkward and unnecessary.
    Despite these shortcomings, the author grasps the essence of people's war, sings praises of the People's Army with full enthusiasm, and draws an outline for the heroic historical events, which is still worth paying attention to. The People's Army has been growing and expanding in battle since its birth on August 1, 1927. There are not too many, but too few, artistic expressions of this aspect in film. In order to reflect historical truth and to educate the people, we need more films that praise these great and moving historical facts.

    “黑山阻击战”观后感
    王地子
      “黑山阻击战”是一部具有一定历史真实性的军事题材的作品。它反映了具有重大意义的辽西战役中的一个侧面。
    1948年的秋天，我东北人民解放军发起秋季攻势，从北满打到辽西，以迅雷不及掩耳之势攻克锦州，接着深陷重围的长春国民党守敌也被迫起义和投降。蒋介石不甘心他在东北的失败，妄想作垂死的挣扎，亲自到沈阳组织守军十余万人倾巢出犯，企图夺回战略要地——锦州，以期恢复辽西北宁线和关内敌人取得联络。我东北人民解放军一个纵队为了掩护主力向辽河平原开进，以便全部消灭敌军，在黑山与敌人展开了一场艰苦而激烈的阻击战。影片“黑山阻击战”正是描写的这一场战斗。
    这个纵队执行任务是十分坚决的。在东北十月寒冷的天气里，战士们连棉衣都没能穿上，手冻得连枪拴都拉不开；但是他们仍然固守着101高地，顽强的战斗着，终于取得胜利，完成了阻击任务。
    从影片当中，我们看到了东北解放战争的艰苦性和顽强性，了解了黑山阻击战的局部情况，也认识到了具有高度革命乐观主义和爱国主义精神的人民军队的本质。其中对于下级指挥员和战士的描写还是比较细致的，例如连长王海龙，虽然戏不多，却给人留下了一个生龙活虎的印象。他在战斗中负了重伤，但是他仍然继续坚持战斗。当他头上裹着绷带，忍着痛楚，率领连队反击敌人时，人们都深深地被感动了。又如纵队司令员的警卫员小刘，这个年轻活泼的小鬼，他对首长的照顾是那样无微不至，从吃饭到作战，他无时无刻不跟随在首长身边；而当他随司令员到前沿阵地去，炮弹袭来，危及司令员的安全时，他又用自己年轻的生命保卫了首长。从这个人物身上，我们也能够触摸到人民战士的崇高的、忘我的心灵。但是影片在描写高级指挥员的时候却比较简单一些，有些情节的安排也还值得研究。像纵队司令员因为101高地失守而擅离指挥所亲自到前沿去的作法，就不够妥当。雷师长的风度和认识水平也表现得低了一些。此外影片中穿插的司令员和女医生的恋爱，看来也很生硬，没有必要。
    尽管影片有这些缺点，但作者抓住了人民战争的本质，以满腔热情来歌颂人民军队，为英雄的史迹画了一个轮廓，这还是值得重视的。人民军队自1927年8月1日诞生直到现在，一直是在战斗中成长与壮大，在电影艺术上这方面表现的不是太多而是太少了。为了反映历史的真实，为了教育人民，我们需要更多歌颂这些伟大的可歌可泣的史实的影片。
