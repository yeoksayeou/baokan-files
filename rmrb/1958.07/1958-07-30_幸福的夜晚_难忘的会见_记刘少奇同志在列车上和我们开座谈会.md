    A Happy Evening, An Unforgettable Meeting
    — A Record of Comrade Liu Shaoqi Holding a Forum with Us on the Train
    Jiangxi Duchang County Visiting Group
    The Carriage Boils Over
    July 12th evening - 17:30, we were just finishing our visit to the Beijing Agricultural Tools Exhibition and boarded the train on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Before long, a message came: "Comrade Shaoqi is going from Tianjin to Jinan, and will be sharing a carriage with us..."
    Upon hearing this news, the comrades were all invigorated and overjoyed. The carriage instantly boiled over.
    The train sped forward, and the conductor told us: We have arrived at Tianjin Station. Ah, this is Tianjin Station! Isn't Comrade Shaoqi about to board the train? The comrades immediately became nervous, and pairs of eyes stared intently at the carriage door. In an instant, a group of people stepped into the carriage, and we recognized the kind, white-haired person as Comrade Shaoqi.
    Soon after boarding the train, Comrade Shaoqi had an intimate conversation with a group of middle school students in our compartment for over an hour. When Comrade Shaoqi asked the students about their plans after graduation, the students all said: "We will make obeying the needs of the motherland our first priority. If we can go to college, we will go to college; if we cannot, we will work. We will not slack off on labor while studying, and we must become the first generation of cultured laborers in New China..." Comrade Shaoqi nodded and smiled frequently, showing the students the bright future of the motherland, and instructing them on how to work and study diligently and be good students and good youths...
    We knew that after talking with the students, Comrade Shaoqi would hold a forum with us. This made us very excited, but also a little nervous. It seemed like we had a lot to say, but also didn't know what to say. The comrades were all in high spirits, preparing to report on our work to Comrade Shaoqi and listen to his teachings.
    The train sped through the night, and soon arrived at Cang County, at about 22:00. This was the moment when Comrade Shaoqi would hold a forum with us.
        Affectionate and Natural
    Comrade Shaoqi was wearing a white shirt, ordinary gray broadcloth trousers, and a pair of ordinary blue cloth shoes. He slowly walked into the center of our group and shook hands with many comrades one by one.
    "Where are you all from? Where are you coming from, and where are you going?" Comrade Shaoqi began to ask us.
    "We are from Duchang County, Jiangxi Province, and came to Beijing to visit the Agricultural Tools Reform Exhibition. Now we are rushing back home," Comrade Zhang Junliang, Deputy County Head, replied to Comrade Shaoqi on behalf of the visiting group.
    "Isn't Duchang County very close to Xingzi, Mount Lu, and Poyang Lake?" Comrade Shaoqi asked familiarly.
    "Yes! Our Duchang is backed by Mount Lu, faces Poyang Lake, and has both mountains and water. We are a neighboring county to Xingzi. The whole county has more than 300,000 people and more than 600,000 mu of land...," Zhang Junliang told Comrade Shaoqi calmly.
    After listening, Comrade Shaoqi took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and offered them to everyone.
    "We don't smoke," everyone told Comrade Shaoqi in unison.
    Then, Comrade Shaoqi began to talk with everyone without any restraint. He was so affectionate and so natural that the nervousness we had at the beginning had long flown to the clouds.
    "How were your gains from this visit?" Comrade Shaoqi continued his questioning.
    "We all think that this visit was like receiving a vivid classroom education at a red and expert school. After returning, we will vigorously carry out technical revolution, imitating, creating, and modifying various tools," Comrade Zhang Junliang reported to Comrade Shaoqi on the gains from the visit and made a guarantee on behalf of everyone.
    "What kind of tools are you going to vigorously develop after you go back? Are there any difficulties?" Comrade Shaoqi asked.
    "We mainly develop transportation tools, water lifting tools, and planting and harvesting tools...," everyone rushed to tell Comrade Shaoqi.
    "Yes, don't be afraid of difficulties. If there are difficulties, overcome them. If you don't know how, learn. We must vigorously carry out technical revolution. For example, after the rural areas implement mechanization, it can increase efficiency several times," Comrade Shaoqi encouraged us.
    "We must do as Comrade Shaoqi instructs," everyone assured him in unison.
    Suddenly, a comrade raised a question: "Now that rural areas are implementing mechanization, we can't buy ball bearings for the wheels."
    "If you don't have them, rely on yourselves to make them!" Comrade Shaoqi taught us with a look of despising difficulties: "Like Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, if the workers can't buy ball bearings, they twist iron wire into small strands and wrap them in the axles, which works very well. You can also try it." After Comrade Shaoqi said this, everyone felt a sense of clarity in their hearts, and they all thought the same thing: Comrade Shaoqi really knows what's in our hearts, and the instructions are so practical!
      "How is the Great Leap Forward going in your county?" Comrade Shaoqi raised a new topic with us.
    "In 1957, our yield was only about 400 jin. This year's slogan is 'Learn from Xiaogan, Catch up with Xingzi, Go all out to compete with Hukou, Grain 800 exceed Pengze'. Now the rice is growing well, and we also thought of striving for a 'Thousand-Jin County' and doing six major things well to realize water conservancy, afforest barren mountains, raise fish in every pond, universalize green manure, fully implement mechanization, and have five pigs per household," Comrade Zhang Junliang reported to Comrade Shaoqi on the Leap Forward situation and plans in Changdu County.
      Talking about the Leap Forward, Discussing the Harvest
      "What is the highest yield in your area?" Comrade Shaoqi asked.
    "In my township, there is a model agricultural cooperative with high rice yields. In 1957, the average yield per mu was over 1,000 jin, and the highest reached over 2,000 jin," said Comrade Zhan Kaizhang, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Xitian Township.
    "That's very good!" Comrade Shaoqi said with a smile, and continued to inquire: "Is there a limit to the increase in grain production?"
    "The increase in production can never reach the top. We want to leap again and again. Within three years, we will build a double-thousand-jin county, and also have ten-thousand-jin mu, even higher...," everyone said with full enthusiasm.
    Comrade Shaoqi gave us a thumbs up and encouraged us: "Yes, that's how you should do it. This year, Leap Forward, and next year, another Great Leap Forward, and the year after that, another Great Leap Forward. As long as we keep leaping forward, we will catch up with Britain quickly. This way, China will change very quickly! Do you think it's right?"
    "Yes! We must remember Comrade Shaoqi's instructions, go all out, and leap forward every year!"
    However, the report to Comrade Shaoqi was not finished. "Seize the sunny days, grab the cloudy days, take a drizzle as a good day, work from dawn till dusk as half a day, and moonlight as daytime." Everyone rushed to tell Comrade Shaoqi about the people's soaring enthusiasm.
    "That's very good, do you have time to rest?" Comrade Shaoqi asked with concern.
    "Yes, we don't rest when we're busy, we rest less when we're idle, and we work night shifts intermittently," everyone answered Comrade Shaoqi.
    "Yes! Labor and rest should be combined. Don't make it so that you never rest, and then have a 'big rest', which will be a problem!" Comrade Shaoqi's words caused a burst of laughter.
    The forum had been going on for an hour, and a comrade next to Comrade Shaoqi suggested: "Should we rest now!"
    Comrade Shaoqi didn't seem to hear. "Are you tired?" he asked everyone with a smile.
    "Not tired! Comrade Shaoqi is tired, he should rest," everyone replied, advising Comrade Shaoqi to rest.
    Comrade Shaoqi shook his head and said, "It's okay, let's talk for a while longer if you're not tired."
  Realizing Communism
  is Very Soon
    "Does your county have any industry? What kind of sideline occupations are there relying on the mountains and Poyang Lake?" Comrade Shaoqi forgot his fatigue, lit another cigarette, and asked a new question.
    "Our county already has factories in every district and township, and factories in every cooperative and team. We have also discovered quartz, pyrite, hematite, petroleum, coal...mines, which are being mined, and iron smelting has already begun. We also want to set up fertilizer plants and sugar factories, but we can't buy machines. The county party committee has also established two reclamation farms in the mountainous areas, with more than 150 cadres going up the mountains. There are also many sideline occupations, such as cutting firewood, burning charcoal, and sawing boards in the mountains, and fishing by the lake...," Comrade Zhang Junliang said.
      "Our Sushan Forestry Farm was built not long ago, but it has developed very quickly. We have built thousands of mu of forest, raised hundreds of Angora rabbits, dozens of buckets of Italian bees, and have Australian chickens. We have learned to make bricks and tiles, and to be carpenters. We are also going to start a labor middle school soon, preparing for major development. Now a cooperative on the edge of the mountain is urgently requesting to join the forestry farm."
    Comrade Wang Nanrong, director of the Sushan Forestry Farm, then told Comrade Shaoqi about the situation of the reclamation farm.
      "Yes! There are many treasures in the mountains! We must vigorously develop the mountainous areas. If the agricultural cooperatives have free time, they can also organize sideline teams to go up the mountains to engage in sideline occupations. Isn't that very good?" Comrade Shaoqi encouraged us and gave us instructions.
      "Our county has also achieved having middle schools in every township, and has universally eliminated illiteracy," everyone continued to add.
    "These are all very good, you're doing well. You can even smelt iron yourselves, can you smelt steel?" Comrade Shaoqi asked a new question with great interest.
    "Our county has not yet smelted steel," Comrade Zhang Junliang replied.
      "You can also learn. If you can smelt iron and steel, and catch up with the world's advanced levels, it will be easy. Aren't you going to pass through Nanjing? Large and small factories there are smelting steel, and government agencies and residents are also smelting steel. You can go there and take a look, okay?" Comrade Shaoqi instructed us. Comrade Shaoqi's instructions were so kind! And how much he valued the creations of the masses. His instructions broadened our minds!
    Comrade Shaoqi again asked us considerately: "Are you tired? Should we rest?"
      "We're not tired, we still want to hear Comrade Shaoqi's instructions," everyone said vigorously.
    Comrade Shaoqi finally taught us:
      "Agricultural cooperatives cannot only engage in one thing, but must develop in a diversified and comprehensive manner." He said while counting on his fingers: "They can engage in industry and set up more local small factories; in agriculture, grasp water conservancy, fertilizer, tool reform, and improved varieties, and the output must leap again and again, and don't think it has reached the top; they can also engage in commerce - socialist commerce, linking up credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives; they can also engage in education, and the hats of illiteracy must be removed, and all children must go to school; they must also engage in sports,... In short, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs must all be developed." He also showed us the prospects of the motherland and said: "China's communism must be realized. Now we don't need fifteen years to catch up with Britain, but we can catch up with it in a very short time. We must continue to advance towards communism! Now don't think that communism is very slow! As long as we work hard, the realization of communism will be very soon."
      "We must work hard to strive for the early realization of communism!" The voices of the crowd responding and laughing intertwined, and everyone was full of vitality.
    It was already very late, and seeing that Jinan was about to arrive, Comrade Shaoqi stood up and said with a smile: "Okay! You can rest now." He shook hands with the surrounding comrades one by one, and ended the forum in joyful applause.
    At 1:30 AM, the train arrived in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province. At this time, Comrade Shaoqi was about to say goodbye to us. He stood up and shouted to everyone: "Goodbye!" The applause shook the entire carriage for a while. Comrade Shaoqi waved non-stop in thanks, and everyone looked out the window with reluctance at Comrade Shaoqi as he went away...
    The train was speeding forward continuously. This happy evening, this unforgettable moment, will forever be engraved in the hearts of thirty-four excited people.

    幸福的夜晚  难忘的会见
    ——记刘少奇同志在列车上和我们开座谈会
    江西都昌县参观团
    车厢沸腾
    7月12日的傍晚——十七点三十分，我们正结束了在北京农具展览会的参观，踏上了京沪线上的列车。不一时，传来一个消息：“少奇同志要从天津到济南，并要和我们共一个车厢……。”
    同志们在听到这个消息之后，一个个都全身振奋，高兴万分，车厢里顿时沸腾起来。
    列车在飞快地前进，列车员告诉我们：已经到了天津车站。啊，这就是天津车站！少奇同志不是就要上车吗？同志们顿时紧张起来，一对对眼瞳都凝神地望着车厢门，正在一刹那，便有一簇人跨进了车厢，我们认得出那位白发慈祥的人，便是少奇同志。
    少奇同志上车不久，便和我们同厢的一群中学生亲谈了一个多小时。少奇同志问到学生们毕业后的打算时，学生们都表示：“要以服从祖国需要为第一志愿，能升学就升学，不能升学就劳动，在学习岗位上，也不放松劳动，一定要做新中国第一代有文化的劳动者……。”少奇同志频频地点头微笑，向学生们展示着祖国的光明前途，指示他们要如何地勤工俭学，做一个好学生，好青年……。
    我们知道，少奇同志和学生们谈话以后，就要和我们开座谈会。这使得我们十分激动，也有些紧张，好像有许多话要说，似乎又不知道说些什么好。同志们一个个都精神抖擞地准备：向少奇同志汇报工作，倾听少奇同志的教导。
    列车在破夜飞驰，很快就到达了沧县，时间大约在二十二时左右，这便是少奇同志和我们开座谈会的时刻。
        亲　切、自　然
    少奇同志穿的是一件带白色的衬衫，普通灰色洋布长裤，一双普通的青布鞋。他徐徐地走入我们人群的中心，和许多同志一一握手。
    “你们都是哪里人？从哪来，到哪去？”少奇同志开始问我们。
    “我们是江西省都昌县来北京参观农具改革展览会的，现在正是赶回家去。”副县长张君亮同志代表参观团向少奇同志回话。
    “都昌县离星子，庐山、波阳湖不是很近吗？”少奇同志很熟悉地问。
    “是！我们都昌是背倚庐山，面临波湖，有山有水，和星子是邻县，全县有三十多万人，六十多万亩土地……。”张君亮从容地告诉少奇同志。
    少奇同志听了以后，从荷包里掏出一盒香烟，要我们大家吸烟。
    “我们都不会吸烟。”大家同声地告诉少奇同志。
    接着，少奇同志同大家毫无拘束地谈起来了。他是这样地亲切，是这样地自然，我们开始存在的拘谨状态早飞向九霄云外去了。
    “你们这次参观的收获怎么样哩？”少奇同志继续开始了他的问话。
    “都认为这次参观等于在红专学校受了一次生动的课堂教育，回去以后要大搞技术革命，仿制，创制，改制各种工具。”张君亮同志向少奇同志汇报参观的收获并代表大家提保证。
    “你们回去要大搞些什么工具，有没有什么困难？”少奇同志问。
    “我们主要是大搞运输工具，提水工具，播种收割工具……。”大家抢着告诉少奇同志。
    “对，你们不要怕困难，有了困难就克服，不会就学。我们要大力搞技术革命。例如农村搞了车子化后，可以提高效力几倍。”少奇同志鼓励我们。
    “我们一定要按少奇同志的指示去做。”大家异口同声地向他保证。
    忽然，有位同志提出一个问题：“现在农村搞车子化，就是买不到轮子上用的弹子。”
    “没有就靠自己做呀！”少奇同志用藐视困难的神色教导我们：“要像安徽省阜阳专区那样，工?买不到弹子，就用铁丝拧成小股包在轮轴里，效果很好，你们也这样试试看。”少奇同志这么一说，大家的心头都顿时有一种开朗的感觉，心里都在同样地想：少奇同志真知道我们内心的事，指示的事是多么切合实际啊！
      “你们县的大跃进搞得怎样呀！”少奇同志又向我们提出了新的话题。
    “1957年我们产量只有四百来斤。今年的口号是‘学孝感，赶星子，鼓足干劲赛湖口，粮食八百超彭泽，现在水稻生长良好，又想到了要争取‘千斤县’，还要干好六件大事，实现水利化、荒山要绿化、塘塘养鱼化、普遍绿肥化、全面车子化、每户五头猪。”张君亮同志向少奇同志报告昌都县的跃进情况和计划。
      谈跃进、话丰收
      “你们那里的最高产量有多少？”少奇同志问。
    “我乡有个水稻丰产模范社，1957年平均亩产一千多斤，最高的达二千多斤。”西田乡党总支书记占开章同志说。
    “那很不错呀！”少奇同志笑着说，又继续探问我们：“粮食增产有没有个顶——有没有个限度呀？”
    “增产永远也不能到顶，我们要一跃再跃，三年之内我们要搞双千斤县，还要搞万斤亩，更高的……”大家干劲十足地说出自己的打算。
    少奇同志伸出大拇指鼓励我们：“对，就要这样干，今年跃进，明年再来一个大跃进，后年还要大跃进，只要不断地跃进，我们赶英国就快了，这样我们中国变样子就快得很呀！你们说对不对？”
    “对呀！我们一定记住少奇同志的指示，鼓足干劲，年年跃进！”
    但是，向少奇同志汇报并没有讲完。“抓晴天，抢阴天，大风细雨当好天，起早摸黑当半天，月光底下当白天。”大家都抢着把群众的冲天干劲告诉给少奇同志听。
    “那好得很，你们有没有休息的时候哪？”少奇同志关心地问。
    “有，忙时不休息，闲时少休息，夜班间断地干。”大家回答着少奇同志。
    “对呀！劳和逸要互相结合，莫弄得总不休息，来个‘大休息’就成问题罗！”少奇同志的话，又引起了一阵大笑。
    座谈会进行了一个小时，少奇同志旁边一位同志提议说：“现在该休息了吧！”
    少奇同志似乎没有听见。“你们累不累呀？”他笑着问大家。
    “不累！少奇同志辛苦了该休息啦。”大家回答着，劝少奇同志去休息。
    少奇同志摇摇手说，“不要紧，你们不累再谈一会吧。”
  实现共产主
  义很快了
    “你们县有没有工业？靠山和波阳湖的有什么副业？”少奇同志忘记了疲劳，又点燃起一支香烟，提出了新的问话。
    “我们县已经是区区乡乡办工厂，社社队队办工厂。还发现了石英、黄铁、赤铁、石油、煤……矿，正在进行开采，已经开始了炼铁。我们还要办起化肥厂、糖厂，就是买不到机器。县委还在山区办了两个垦殖场，上山的干部有一百五十多名。副业也很多，靠山的打柴、烧炭、锯板，靠湖的打鱼……”张君亮同志告诉说。
      “我们苏山林场建得不久，发展得很快。我们造了几千亩林，养了几百个安哥拉兔，几十桶意大利蜂，有澳洲鸡，自己学会了做砖瓦，做木匠，马上又办劳动中学，准备大发展，现在山边的一个合作社，已经迫切要求加入林场。”
    苏山林场场长王南荣同志接着把垦殖场的情况告诉少奇同志。
      “是呀！山区的宝藏多得很啊！我们就要大搞山区。农业社有空，也可组织副业队上山搞副业，这不好得很?？”少奇同志一边鼓励，一边指示我们。
      “我们县里还实现了乡乡有中学，普遍扫除了文盲。”大家继续作补充。
    “这些都很好哇，干得不错，自己还会炼铁，会不会炼钢呀？”少奇同志很有兴趣地问起了一个新问题。
    “我们县暂时还未炼钢。”张君亮同志回答着。
      “你们也可以学，能炼铁，又炼钢，赶上世界先进水平，就好办了。你们不是要经过南京吗，那里的大小工厂都炼钢，机关单位也炼钢，居民也炼钢，可以到那里看看，好不好？”少奇同志指示我们。少奇同志的指示，多么亲切！对待群众的创造又多么珍重，他的指示，使我们的心胸多么开阔！
    少奇同志又体贴地问我们：“累不累？要休息了吧？”
      “我们不累，还想听听少奇同志的指示。”大家很有劲地说。
    少奇同志最后教导我们说：
      “农业社不能单搞一门，要多种多样地全面发展。”他一边数着指头说：“可以搞工业，多办一些地方性的小厂子；搞农业抓住水利、肥料、工具改革、优良品种，产量要一跃再跃，不要认为它到了顶；还可以搞商业——社会主义商业，把信用社、供销社、农业社联起来；还可以搞教育，文盲帽子都要摘掉，儿童都要上学；还要搞体育，……。总之就是工、农、商、学、兵都要发展。”他还向我们展示着祖国的前景说：“中国的共产主义一定要实现。我们现在不要十五年赶英国，在很短的时间内就能把它赶上。我们要一直往共产主义前进！现在不要认为共产主义是很慢的啊！只要我们好好干，实现共产主义就很快了。”
      “我们一定要好好干，争取早日实现共产主义！”众人的回话声、笑声交织在一起，大家全身充满着活力。
    时间已经很晚了，看看济南就快到了，少奇同志起身笑着说：“好吧！你们可以休息了。”他和周围的同志一一地握手，在欢乐的掌声中结束了座谈会。
    一点三十分，列车驶到了山东省会——济南市。这时，少奇同志就要和我们告别了，他立起身来，向大家喊着：“再见！”一时的掌声震动着整个车厢，少奇同志不停地招手答谢，大家都怀着恋恋难舍的心情攀窗一直望着少奇同志远去……。
    列车在不断地向前疾驶。这个幸福的夜晚，难忘的时刻，却永远永远地铭刻在三十四颗激动的心坎里。
