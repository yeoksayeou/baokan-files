Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: New York Dispatch: According to American newspaper reports, the military operation launched by the Cuban Batista dictatorship government not long ago to attack the rebel forces led by Castro has ended in failure. After fierce battles with the insurgents, 11,000 well-equipped government troops were forced to retreat.

    According to "New York Times" reporter Bigart, the government troops brutally persecuted all residents of Oriente Province suspected of sympathizing with the insurgents.

    At the same time, the Batista government is strengthening its reign of terror throughout the country. According to the "Spanish People's Daily" published in Mexico, Cuban prisons and torture chambers are now filled with prisoners who are subjected to brutal torture.

    American newspapers admit that the American government supports Batista's bloody suppression of the uprising people. "New York Times" reporter Bigart pointed out that the Guantanamo American military base, located in the southeastern part of Oriente Province, the main base of the Cuban rebel army, supplies gasoline to Batista's military aircraft. These aircraft frequently bomb insurgents and peaceful villages. Many villages "have been leveled by aircraft." The US government is also continuously shipping arms to the Cuban government. Officials at the US State Department acknowledged on the 2nd that the US recently handed over 300 rockets to Batista's military aircraft for use at the Guantanamo American military base.

    起义烽火是扑灭不了的
    古巴政府军进攻遭失败
    美国支持独裁者残酷镇压起义人民
    据新华社3日讯　纽约消息：据美国报纸报道，古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政府不久以前发起的进攻卡斯特罗领导的起义部队的军事行动已经以失败告终。同起义者进行激烈战斗以后，一万一千名装备优良的政府军被迫退却。
    据“纽约时报”记者比加特报道，政府军残酷迫害所有被怀疑同情起义者的奥连特省居民。
    巴蒂斯塔政府同时在全国加强恐怖统治。据墨西哥出版的“西班牙人民报”报道，现在古巴监狱里和拷问室里关满了犯人，他们遭到残酷的拷打。
    美国报纸承认，美国政府支持巴蒂斯塔对起义人民进行血腥镇压。“纽约时报”的比加特指出，位于古巴起义军主要根据地奥连特省东南部的关塔那摩美国军事基地把汽油供给巴蒂斯塔的军用飞机。这些飞机经常轰炸起义者和和平村镇。许多村镇“已被飞机夷为平地”。美国政府还在源源不断地运送军火给古巴政府，美国国务院的官员2日承认，美国最近就曾经在关塔那摩美国军事基地把三百支火箭交给巴蒂斯塔的军用飞机使用。
