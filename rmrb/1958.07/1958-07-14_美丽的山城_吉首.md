    Beautiful Mountain City – Jishou
    By Our Correspondent Long Wenming
    The car speeding along the Hunan-Sichuan Highway, after passing through Changde and Taoyuan, enters the mountainous area of western Hunan. In a small plain, rows of brand-new, tall buildings emerge. This is Jishou, the capital of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    Jishou is indeed changing too fast. At the foot of the mountain in the east, a place that was wilderness two or three years ago, now has more than a dozen factories built. On the bank of the Dong River is the Autonomous Prefecture's Dong River timber collection yard. Next to the timber collection yard, an electric timber processing plant is under construction. Soon, the timber produced in the Autonomous Prefecture, after being processed into various materials, can be directly transported to construction sites across the country.

    Looking northeast, on a small hill in the green trees, is the Xiangxi First National Normal School. Comrade Luo Shengjiao, an internationalist martyr, once studied here. Now, this school has 641 students, of which 445 are Miao students alone, eight times more than in 1950. The first Miao language school in the Autonomous Prefecture is under construction across the river from this small hill, and will be completed in the third quarter of this year. Along the small hill under construction are also schools for training accountants, commercial workers, and agricultural technicians for all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Prefecture, and Jishou Middle School.

    Standing on this small hill, you can overlook the entire view of Jishou. The clear waters of the Dong River meander through the center of Jishou. A large bridge spanning the Dong River connects the north and south banks of Jishou. This was built the year before last. The Hunan-Sichuan Highway runs down the mountain from the southern suburbs, and after reaching Huayuan County, it joins the Huayuan-Baojing-Yongshun-Dayong-Cili Highway, which connects the northern mountainous area where the Tujia people of the Autonomous Prefecture live. It forms the transportation artery connecting the lake area and the mountainous area in the northwest corner of Hunan Province. Extending southwest from Jishou is the Jishou-Fenghuang-Tongren Highway, the third shortcut across the Wuling Mountains. Since this highway opened to traffic in March last year, the Miao people of western Hunan and the Miao people of eastern Guizhou Province have had more frequent contact. At the same time, large quantities of tung oil, gallnuts, and cinnabar produced in the eastern Guizhou area can also be transported to all parts of the country via this shortcut.

    At the foot of the mountain in the southwest, the Autonomous Prefecture's three-story office building and rows of new high-rise buildings nearby stand in stark contrast to the dilapidated and small old tile-roofed houses of Jishou. In recent years, the population of Jishou has increased to more than 20,000, and more than 400 new high-rise buildings have been built, covering an area of approximately 120,000 square meters. After the establishment of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in October 1957, the leading organs of the Autonomous Prefecture were located here.

    The busiest place in Jishou is a newly built east-west avenue. Banks, post and telecommunications bureaus, Xinhua bookstores, hospitals, various department stores, cultural centers, theaters, etc., are all distributed on this avenue. Farmers of all ethnic groups from deep mountain villages often carry tung oil, pine firewood, medicinal materials, and other local products to Jishou to exchange for daily-use industrial products. In the past, Jishou held a market fair only once every five days. Now, it has become a mountain city that is lively day and night.

    A comrade from the Jishou Municipal Construction Committee told reporters that Jishou is also preparing to build a cinema and a歌舞剧院 (song and dance theater), and the Jishou Park and a workers' club with a building area of more than 3,000 square meters will soon begin construction. The changes in Jishou are just as many Tujia and Miao youths studying elsewhere say, "After only two or three years, even Jishou can't be recognized." Once, a Miao youth sang:

    Jishou, how young and beautiful you are!
    After a few years of absence, you have changed your appearance again.
    Chairman Mao's ethnic policy,
    Has awakened my sleeping hometown! (Attached pictures)

### 美丽的山城——吉首

    美丽的山城——吉首
    本报记者　龙文明
    沿着湘川公路奔驶的汽车，经过常德、桃源进入湘西山区，在一个小小的平原上，涌现出一排排崭新的高大建筑物，这就是湘西土家族苗族自治州的首府——吉首。
    吉首真是变得太快。在东边山脚下，两三年前还是一片荒野的地方，现在已修起了十多个工厂。峒河边上，是自治州的峒河集材场。在集材场旁边，正在动工兴建一座电动木材加工厂。不久，自治州出产的木材，经过加工成各种用材后，就可以直接运往祖国各地的建设工地去。
    向东北方眺望，在绿树丛中的小山岗上，是湘西第一民族师范学校。国际主义烈士罗盛教同志，曾在这里读过书。现在，这所学校有学生六百四十一人，其中仅苗族学生就有四百四十五人，比1950年增加八倍。自治州的第一所苗文学校，正在这小山岗对河建设起来，今年第三季度可全部完工。沿着小山岗下正在动工建设的，还有培养自治州各族会计、商业工作者、农业技术干部的学校和吉首中学。
    站在这座小山岗上，可以俯视吉首全景。清澈的峒河河水，从吉首中心蜿蜒流过。一座跨越峒河的大桥，联结了吉首南北两岸。这是前年才修建的。湘川公路从南郊山下溜过，到花垣县后，与联接自治州土家族聚居的北部山区的花垣——保靖——永顺——大庸——慈利公路，组成湖南省西北角的滨湖同山区沟通的运输大动脉。从吉首向西南伸展去的，是吉首——凤凰——铜仁公路，是翻越武陵山脉的第三条捷径。湘西的苗族与贵州省东部的苗族，由于去年3月这条公路通车后，联系更加频繁了。同时，黔东地区出产的大宗桐油、五棓子和朱砂，也可经这条捷径运往祖国各地。
    西南山脚下，矗立着自治州的三层办公大楼和附近一排排崭新的高楼大厦，同吉首破烂矮小的古老瓦房，成了显明的对照。几年来，吉首的人口已增加到二万多人，新建的高楼大厦有四百多栋，面积约十二万平方公尺。1957年10月湘西土家族苗族自治州成立后，自治州的领导机关就设在这里。
    吉首最热闹的地方，是一条刚修成的东西大街。银行、邮电局、新华书店、医院、各个百货公司、文化馆、剧院等，都分布在这条大街上。附近深山村寨里的各族农民，常年担着、背着桐油、松柴、药材等土特产品到吉首来换日用工业品。过去，吉首每五天才集墟一次，现在，已变成一座日夜都很热闹的山城。
    吉首市政建设委员会的一位同志告诉记者，目前，吉首还准备再筹建一座电影院和一座歌舞剧院，吉首公园和一个拥有三千多平方公尺建筑物的工人俱乐部也即将开工了。吉首的变化正如在外学习的许多土家族苗族青年说的一样，只隔二三年，连吉首都认不出来了。有一次，一个苗族青年曾这样歌唱：
    吉首啊，您多么年轻漂亮！
    几年不见，您又换了个模样。
    毛主席的民族政策，
    唤醒了我沉睡的故乡！（附图片）
