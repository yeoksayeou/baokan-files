    Metallurgical Industry Innovation
    Indigenous Method for Refining Aluminum Oxide Succeeds

    (Our report) The Jiaozuo City Aluminum Mine Preparatory Office has successfully used an indigenous method to extract aluminum oxide from clay.

    In February of this year, in order to develop local industry and utilize national resources, the Jiaozuo Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred specialists to conduct experiments on extracting aluminum oxide from clay using indigenous methods. This was a new topic in the metallurgical industry. According to existing data, due to the excessive silicon content in clay, it is not easily sintered, making it impossible to extract the aluminum components it contains. Comrades in charge of the experiment consulted engineering and technical personnel from seven units, but they could not find a way to extract aluminum from clay. Later, with the repeated encouragement of Zhang Zhong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Li Wanwen, a folk expert conducting the experiment, mixed the clay into a fine powder, added lime and soda, and calcined it at a high temperature of 1400 degrees Celsius. After five trials, aluminum oxide was finally extracted from the clay. After being identified by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the quality was good. The aluminum oxide can then be electrolytically decomposed to become metallic aluminum used in industry.

    In the suburbs of Jiaozuo City, clay deposits are abundant, with aluminum content ranging from 45% to 50%. The clay is very close to the surface, making it suitable for open-pit mining.

    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the State Planning Commission attach great importance to this indigenous aluminum refining method. They have sent engineering and technical personnel to summarize the experience and are responsible for assisting in the design work for building a factory.

    冶金工业的创举
    土法炼铝氧成功
    本报讯　焦作市铝矿筹建处用土法从粘土中提炼铝氧成功。
    今年2月，中共焦作市委为发展地方工业和利用国家资源，即抽调专人进行用土法从粘土中提炼铝氧的试验。这是冶金工业的一个新课题，根据已有资料，由于粘土中矽的含量太多，不容易烧结，不能把所含的铝成分提炼出来。负责进行试验的同志曾访问七个单位的工程技术人员，也没有找到从粘土中提炼出铝的办法。后来，经市委副书记张重的再三鼓励，进行试验的土专家李万文把粘土拌成细末，加上石灰和苏打放在一千四百度高温下烧炼，经过五次试制，终于从粘土中提炼出三氧化二铝，经过冶金工业部鉴定，质量良好，三氧化二铝再经过电离分解后就成为工业上所用的金属铝。
    焦作市郊一带，粘土埋藏量丰富，含铝成分都在45％到50％。粘土离地表很近，适宜露天开采。
    冶金工业部和国家计划委员会对这一土法炼铝很重视，特派工程技术人员总结经验，并负责帮助建厂的设计工作。
