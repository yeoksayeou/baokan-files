Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th. The fourth team of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Xiping County, Henan Province, harvested a total of 14,640 jin from two mu of high-yield wheat experimental fields, averaging 7,320 jin per mu. This is the 29th "satellite" with a wheat yield of over 3,000 jin per mu launched in Henan Province this year.

These two mu of high-yield wheat experimental fields were mainly cultivated by Chen Yanli (Communist Party member), the cooperative's director, and Feng Fuyao (Communist Youth League member), the fourth team's leader, with technical guidance from Zhang Lianyu (Communist Party member) of the County Agricultural Bureau. Li Zhishan, Secretary of the Chengguan Town Party Committee, Dai Shulin, Secretary of the cooperative's Party branch, Li Changshun (Communist Party member), Chen Qunsheng (Communist Party member), Chen Shufan (youth), and Lü Siwen (young woman), propaganda workers of the Chengguan Town Party Committee, also regularly participated in labor and management. These two mu of wheat grew exceptionally well, with large and long ears, full grains, and dense and even growth, averaging 1,486,200 plants per mu, so dense that even mice could not get into the field. The largest ears of wheat had 130 grains, the average ears had 70 to 80 grains, and the smallest ears had about 50 grains. This wheat was harvested on June 18th. The entire team of twelve people worked from 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM to complete the harvest, actually working for nineteen hours, with each person averaging only 0.166 mu. The threshing of these two mu of wheat began on June 21st. The first round was threshed separately, lasting five days and five sessions. On June 26th, winnowing and sun-drying began. The weighing and storage took place on July 1st. The total for the first round was 14,040 jin. The second round of threshing was mixed with ordinary wheat, and it was estimated that 600 jin were threshed.

The Chengguan Town Party Committee and responsible comrades from the Xiping County Party and government also participated in the harvesting, threshing, winnowing, and weighing. To further verify the yield, the Henan Provincial Party Committee instructed the Xiping County Party Committee and the Chengguan Town Party Committee to re-examine. The final verification proved that the high yield was completely accurate.

The main experiences of the Heping Cooperative in achieving high yields are: First, deep plowing and fine harrowing. These two mu of land had previously been used for cucumbers. Before sowing, four plowings and twelve harrowings were carried out. After each plowing, harrowing was done three times: straight, diagonally, and straight again. One time, three sets of plows were used to plow to a depth of 1.8 to 2 feet. Second, selecting fine varieties, sowing at the right time, and rational close planting. The wheat variety was "Zhongnong 28." Sowing was done five days before Cold Dew. The seeds were treated by sunning, wind selection, screening, clay selection, warm water soaking, and Ceresan mixing. The planting density was: row spacing of four inches, sowing 35 jin per mu, and a depth of two inches. Third, "Eight Waterings and Six Fertilizations." Each mu was fertilized with 120,000 jin of base fertilizer. This included 50,000 jin of coarse fertilizer, 400 dan of human waste and urine, 50 jin of ammonium sulfate, 500 jin of wood ash, and 20 jin of superphosphate. Fourth, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and preventing frost. Before sowing, two jin of red alum were mixed with four jin of millet and scattered on the bottom of the plow to prevent wireworms and mole crickets. Before Qingming, red spiders were discovered and 0.5% of 666 powder was sprayed twice continuously, completely eliminating the insect pests. Fifth, cultivating and weeding. After the winter solstice, shallow hoeing was done once and harrowing was done once, mainly to preserve moisture, increase soil temperature, and prevent excessive growth of wheat seedlings. Sixth, during the summer harvest, meticulous harvesting and threshing were carried out to ensure that all grains were stored in the granary.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 11th. New and happy news of a high yield of 3,275 jin per mu of early rice has been reported from Chengmen Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province. The creator of this record yield is the production team led by Ou Zilian, a Communist Party member of the Linpu Agricultural Cooperative in the township.

The early rice experimental field of this production team totaled 2.037 mu. When the harvest began at 4:00 AM on the 7th, members of other production teams also came to participate in the harvesting and weighing. Lin Changpeng, Deputy Secretary of the township branch, Lin Xiuqing, member of the branch committee, and Lian Jiwen, Director of the Propaganda Department of the county party committee, were all present to inspect. This field yielded a total of 6,949 jin of wet rice, an actual yield of 6,671 jin and 8 liang of dry rice, averaging 3,275 jin, 2 liang and 3 qian of dry rice per mu, an increase of 4.9 times compared to the team's yield of 550 jin per mu last year.

The high yield created by the production team led by Ou Zilian was mainly centered on close planting, combined with good deep plowing and increased fertilization measures. When transplanting rice seedlings in the experimental field, each team member brought a standard transplanting tool to the field, measured while transplanting, and planted according to a 6×3 close planting pattern, with more than 33,000 clusters of seedlings planted, achieving layered fertilization, heavy base fertilizer application, and applying 3,600 dan of river mud, 95 dan of human waste, and miscellaneous fertilizers such as garbage.

    7320斤——小麦层层加码
    3275斤——早稻步步高升
    据新华社郑州11日电　河南省西平县城关镇和平农业社第四队二亩小麦丰产试验田，总产一万四千六百四十斤，平均亩产七千三百二十斤。这是河南省今年麦收中放出的小麦亩产三千斤以上的第二十九颗“卫星”。
    这二亩小麦丰产试验田主要是由以社长陈颜理（共产党员）、第四队队长冯富耀（共青团员）二人种的，由县农业局张连宇（共产党员）作技术指导。经常参加劳动和管理的还有中共城关镇委书记李志善、社党支书戴树林、城关镇委宣传干事李长顺（共产党员）、陈群生（共产党员）、陈树范（青年）、吕四文（青年妇女）等人。这二亩小麦长的特别好，穗大且长，籽粒饱满，稠密均匀，每亩平均一百四十八万六千二百株，密得老鼠也钻不进地。最大的麦穗有一百三十粒，一般的麦穗有七、八十粒，最小的麦穗也有五十粒左右。这二亩小麦是6月18日收割的。全队十二人从上午五时到夜十二时才割完，实割十九个小时，每人平均只割一分六厘六毫。6月21日起，这二亩麦开始打场。头遍是单打的，共打了五天、五场。6月26日起开始扬场、晒麦。7月1日过秤入仓。总计头遍共打了一万四千零四十斤。第二遍场是和一般麦混打的，根据推算共打了六百斤。
    参加这次收割、打场、扬场、过秤的还有中共城关镇委、西平县党政负责同志。为了进一步核实产量，中共河南省委又指示西平县委和城关镇委复查。最后证明高额丰产完全属实。
    和平社获得高额丰产的主要经验是：第一、深犁细耙。这二亩地是黄瓜茬。播种前，进行了四犁十二耙。每犁一次后，顺耙、斜耙、顺耙三次。其中一次曾用三套犁深犁一尺八寸至二尺。第二、选用良种，适时播种，合理密植。麦种是“中农二八”。寒露前五天下种。在种子处理上，经过曝晒、风选、筛选、胶泥选、温汤浸种和赛力散拌种。播种密度是：行距四寸，每亩下种三十五斤，深度二寸。第三、“八水六肥”。光肥料每亩就施底肥十二万斤。粗肥五万斤，人粪尿四百担，硫酸铵五十斤，草木灰五百斤，过磷酸钙二十斤。第四、防治病虫害，防霜冻。下种前，用红矾二斤掺小米四斤，撒在犁底上防治金针虫、蝼蛄。清明前，发现红蜘蛛，用0.5％的六六六粉，连续喷撒二次，全部消灭了虫害。第五、中耕除草。冬至后，浅锄一遍，耙?一遍，主要是保墒，增加地温，防止麦苗旺长。第六、夏收时，作到了细收细打，颗粒归仓。
    新华社福州11日电　早稻亩产达三千二百七十五斤的高额丰产新捷报，又从福建省闽侯县城门乡传出。这个丰产纪录的创造者是这个乡林浦农业社共产党员欧子连领导的生产队。
    这个生产队种的一块早稻试验田共二亩零三厘七毫，7日早晨四点开镰时，别的生产队的社员也来参加收割过秤，乡支部副书记林长鹏、支部委员林秀清、县委宣传部长廉继温等都到场验收。这块地共收六千九百四十九斤湿谷，实收干谷六千六百七十一斤八两，平均亩产干谷三千二百七十五斤二两三钱，比去年这个队亩产五百五十斤增加四倍九。
    欧子连领导的生产队创造高额丰产，主要是以密植为中心，结合做好深翻和多施肥等增产措施。在试验田插秧时，每个队员都带了插秧标准器下田，边插边量，按6×3密植，插秧丛数达三万三千多丛，做到分层施肥，重施基肥，施下三千六百担河泥，九十五担人粪和垃圾等杂肥。
