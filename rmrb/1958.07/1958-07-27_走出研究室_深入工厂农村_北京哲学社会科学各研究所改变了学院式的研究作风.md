Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The philosophical and social science research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have undergone a complete change in their research style after rectification. Most researchers have already stepped out of their offices or are preparing to do so, going deep into factories and rural areas. A new research style that connects with reality and follows the mass line is beginning to replace the past academic research style.

The Institute of Philosophy has established six fixed contact points: Xuchang Prefecture in Henan Province, Hongzhuan University in Xushui County, Hebei Province, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, a weaving factory and an agricultural cooperative in Haidian District in the suburbs of Beijing. The research groups of the entire institute have formed six teams, which will go to the above six contact points respectively. On the one hand, they will participate in physical labor to temper the ideological consciousness and standpoint of the researchers. On the other hand, they will learn from the masses and help them study philosophy; understand the systematic development of these contact points, and accumulate materials for philosophical research. Some of these work teams have already started working, and some are about to start working. The researchers going to Hongzhuan University in Xushui County and Xuchang Prefecture are preparing to write two popular philosophy textbooks, one for workers and one for farmers. In addition, a research group has gone to Xuchang Prefecture to understand the local implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction, collect materials in this regard, and prepare to write a book that elucidates the general line from a philosophical perspective. Pan Zinian, director of the Institute of Philosophy, has gone to Henan, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other regions to understand the actual situation and collect materials, preparing to write philosophical papers or books. Deputy Director Zhang Yong is also about to go to Henan, preparing to write papers or books on the base and superstructure.

In the past, the First Institute of History Research studied ancient times for the sake of ancient times. Now, it has clarified that the study of ancient history must also implement the principle of emphasizing the present over the past. Since July 1st, they have jointly established a study group for Comrade Mao Zedong's works with the Second Institute of History Research. They excerpted relevant historical theories from Marxist-Leninist classics and Comrade Mao Zedong's works. The first draft has been completed, with approximately two to three hundred thousand words, including discussions on various social forms. Based on this work, they have summarized nine research topics: the definition of slave and feudal societies and their development laws, the emergence of capitalism, etc. The research on these issues will help solve the long-standing debate on the periodization of Chinese history. After criticizing bourgeois individualism in the rectification movement, this institute abolished the past private "small warehouses" (historical materials) and established a public material accumulation system. They selected useful materials from more than 10 million words of ancient books before the Sui Dynasty, amounting to about three to four million words, and compiled them into a collection of historical materials of ancient China. This work will be completed by the end of July. Following this, they will edit a critical journal called "Questions on Ancient Chinese History," which is scheduled to be launched in early October.

The field investigation work of the Institute of Archaeology and the Institute of Minority Languages ​​both paid attention to implementing the mass line. 70% to 80% of the researchers at the Institute of Minority Languages ​​have gone or will soon go to various minority areas to continue creating and selecting scripts for ethnic minorities and carry out literacy work. The work team going to Yunnan departed in mid-June. Under the leadership of the local party committee, they are currently focusing on participating in literacy work in minority areas, conducting minority language surveys through mass movements. The Institute of Archeology currently has eleven work teams operating in the field. Because they participated in the production labor of the masses, each team participated in the harvesting work of the agricultural cooperatives during the wheat harvest season. Therefore, their excavation work has also received enthusiastic support and assistance from the masses.

After the philosophical and social science workers went deep among the masses, they had many insights.

After the researchers of the Institute of Philosophy went down, they first felt that the working class and peasants have a high demand for learning philosophy, there are many philosophical problems in real life, and there are rich philosophical materials everywhere. The work team from the Institute of Minority Languages ​​going to Yunnan is preparing to cooperate with local organizations to eradicate illiteracy among young and middle-aged ethnic minorities on the Yunnan border within three months.

    走出研究室　深入工厂农村
    北京哲学社会科学各研究所改变了学院式的研究作风
    据新华社26日讯　中国科学院在北京的哲学社会科学方面各研究机构经过整风以后，研究作风焕然一新，大部分研究人员已经或正在准备走出办公室，深入工厂农村。联系实际、走群众路线的新研究作风开始代替过去学院式的研究作风。
    哲学研究所已经确定了六个固定联系点：河南省许昌专区、河北省徐水县红专大学、石景山钢铁厂、北京郊区海淀区的一个织布厂和一个农业社。全所各研究组混合组成了六个队，分别到上述六个联系点去，一方面参加体力劳动，锻炼研究人员的思想意识和立场，另一方面向群众学习，并帮助群众学习哲学；了解这些联系点的系统的发展情况，积累哲学研究的资料。这些工作队有的已经开始工作，有的即将开始工作。到徐水县红专大学和许昌专区去的研究人员，准备写出两本通俗的哲学课本，一本以工人为对象，一本以农民为对象。除此以外，有一个研究小组已去许昌专区了解当地贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线的情况，搜集这方面的材料，准备写一本从哲学角度来阐明总路线的书。哲学研究所所长潘梓年已到河南、武汉、广州等地区去了解实际情况、收集资料，准备写出哲学论文或书籍来；副所长张镛也即将去河南，准备写出有关基础与上层建筑的论文或书籍。
    历史研究所第一所过去是为古代而研究古代，现在明确了古代史的研究也必须贯彻厚今薄古方针。从“七一”开始，他们同历史研究所第二所联合成立了毛泽东同志著作学习会。他们摘录马克思列宁主义经典著作以及毛泽东同志著作中有关历史理论部分，初稿已经完成，约有二、三十万字，内容包括对于各个社会形态的论述。在这项工作的基础上，他们归纳出了九个研究专题：奴隶、封建社会的定义及其发展规律，资本主义的萌芽等。这些问题的研究将有助于解决长期以来争论着的中国历史分期问题。在整风运动中批判了资产阶级个人主义以后，这个研究所取消了过去的私人“小仓库”（历史资料），建立了公共资料积累制度。他们从隋以前的一千多万字的古书中挑选出了有用的材料约三、四百万字，编印成为中国古代史料汇编，这件工作7月底即可完成。紧接着，他们将编辑一种批判性期刊——“中国古史问题”，预定10月初创刊。
    考古研究所和少数民族语言研究所的野外调查工作都注意了贯彻群众路线问题。少数民族语言研究所70％到80％的研究人员已经或即将到各少数民族地区去工作，继续进行为少数民族创制和选择文字以及扫盲工作。去云南的工作队已在6月中旬出发。他们在当地党委领导下，目前以参加少数民族地区扫盲工作为中心任务，通过群众运动来进行少数民族语言调查工作。考古研究所现在有十一个工作队在野外活动。由于他们参加群众的生产劳动，在麦收季节，每个队都参加了农业社的收割工作，因此他们的发掘工作也得到群众的热情支持和协助。
    哲学社会科学工作者深入群众以后，有很多体会。
    哲学研究所的研究人员下去以后，首先感到工农群众对于学习哲学的要求很高，实际生活中哲学问题很多，到处有丰富的哲学材料。少数民族语言研究所去云南的工作队准备配合当地组织，在三个月的时间内把云南边疆少数民族青壮年文盲扫完。
