Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 17th: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today saying that the Korean government and the Korean people resolutely protest and condemn the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan, and fully support and stand in solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and all Arab countries to oppose imperialism and defend national independence and sovereignty. The Korean people strongly demand that the United States and Britain immediately cease their aggressive actions in Lebanon and Jordan and withdraw their troops. The statement denounces the US imperialist aggression against Lebanon as a brutal trampling on the basic principles of international law and a serious provocation to peace in Asia, Africa, and the whole world.
    The statement points out: The Arab people have the legitimate right to choose their own government and defend national independence according to their own will, without any foreign interference. The armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan cannot be legitimized by any pretext and cannot be tolerated.
    The statement emphasizes that if the United States and Britain do not withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan and continue their aggressive actions, then they will be playing with fire and destroy themselves.

The US government must be responsible for all the consequences caused by this aggressive act.
    David pointed out that the US government's aggressive actions cannot hinder the victory of the Arab people's just efforts to strive for independence and freedom. The Czechoslovak people unreservedly sympathize with these efforts of the Arab people.
