Title: The Contradictions Faced by Aggressors

War or peace? Destruction or war? This is a question that aggressors are forced to choose between immediately. The Soviet Union has long called for a meeting of the heads of state of the five major powers to resolve the Middle East issue; in order to quickly take the most urgent measures to stabilize the Middle East situation and prevent world conflict, the Soviet Union has agreed to hold such a meeting within the framework of the UN Security Council. If the US and British aggressors accept this call, the Soviet Union will ultimately gain the highest honor of preventing world war and saving mankind, and will win a victory in resolving the Middle East issue; if they reject this call, the bandits will become more isolated in the world and will bear the serious consequences of triggering a world war and destroying themselves. The Soviet Union will still win the victory of world hearts. For the aggressors, this is an inescapable contradiction.

The 1960s are not the 19th century, and the most powerful weapons are no longer machine guns, cannons, and gunboats. The US and British bandits have atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and the Soviet people especially have atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and also have intercontinental ballistic missiles that the US and British aggressors do not yet have; the disparity in strength is already very obvious. But this is not the most important factor. The more important factor is that the awakened oppressed classes and oppressed nations have stood up and are standing up. The world people's enthusiasm and determination to defend peace alone is a force greater than billions of atomic bombs, not to mention that the latest weapons are in the hands of such people. If the bandits do not put down their plundering weapons in time, they will fall into a quagmire that becomes deeper and deeper, into a trap many times greater than the invasion of Korea, the invasion of Egypt, and the invasion of Algeria, into a miserable situation where all the bandits' armed forces combined cannot maintain Lebanon and Jordan, let alone the imperialist bandits themselves.

For the bandits, there is of course the question of whether it is better to lose face and save their lives, or to save face and lose their lives. Dr. Soper of England has already made a choice for them. He believes: "It is much better to lose face and save your life than to save face and lose your life." But whether the bandits can survive depends on whether they themselves have such a smart mind.

Ironclad facts can even be seen by some clear-headed fat cats on Wall Street. "The Wall Street Journal" pointed out: "All the basic forces at work in the Middle East will not change due to the intervention in Lebanon. We still have the exact same problems after the Marines landed as we did before the Marines landed." This is why aggressors can never escape final punishment.

The above are the many contradictions faced by the US and British bandits. They will inevitably be buried in this pile of contradictions.

Contradictions can only be overcome, not reconciled! And what is overcome must be its most decadent side.

The people of the world can only struggle against, conquer, and annihilate the US and British bandits, and cannot accommodate, appease, or fear them! Let us shout in unison: "If the enemy does not lay down its weapons, then eliminate it!"

    侵略者面临的矛盾
    邓初民
    战争还是和平？毁灭还是战争？这是逼在侵略者面前必须立即加以抉择的问题。苏联早就提出了召开五大国首脑会议解决中近东问题的呼吁；为了迅速采取最紧急的措施，安定中东局势，防止世界冲突，苏联又同意了在联合国安理会范围内去开这样的会议。如果美英侵略者接受这种呼吁，苏联就终将获得防止世界大战拯救人类的最高荣誉，而在中东问题的解决上获得胜利；如果他们拒绝这个呼吁，强盗们就将在全世界更加孤立起来，而且要承担引发世界大战、毁灭自己的严重后果，苏联仍将获得世界人心的胜利。在侵略者来说这是一个无法逃避的矛盾。
    二十世纪六十年代已经不是十九世纪了，最厉害的武器已经不是机关枪、大炮、炮舰了。美英强盗有原子弹、氢弹，苏联人民尤其有原子弹、氢弹，而且还有美英侵略者还未有的洲际弹道导弹；强弱的悬殊本来已是很明显的。但这还不是最重要的因素，更重要的因素是觉醒了的被压迫阶级和被压迫民族已经站起来了和正在站起来。仅是世界人民保卫和平的热情和决心，就是比亿万颗原子弹还要巨大的力量，何况最新式的武器又是掌握在这样的人民手里。强盗们如果不及时放下抢劫的武器，就要陷到愈陷愈深的拔不出来的泥坑中去，陷到比侵略朝鲜、侵略埃及、侵略阿尔及利亚大好多倍的陷阱中去，陷到把强盗们的武装部队全部合起来，不仅不能保持黎巴嫩、约旦，而且不能保持帝国主义强盗本身的悲惨境地中去。
    对于强盗们来说，当然也存在失掉面子比保全生命好呢？还是保全面子失掉生命好的问题。英国的索佩尔博士已代他们作了选择。他认为：“失掉面子而保全生命要比保全面子而失掉生命好得多。”但强盗们能否获得生存，就要看他们自己是否也有这样聪明的头脑了。
    铁的事实连华尔街的某些头脑清醒的大腹贾也看得到。“华尔街日报”指出：“在中东起作用的一切基本力量都不会因干涉黎巴嫩而有所变化。我们在海军陆战队登陆以后仍持有与海军陆战队登陆以前完全一样的问题”。这就是侵略者总逃不脱最后的惩罚。
    以上是美英强盗们面临着的重重矛盾。他们必然会要埋葬在这一大堆矛盾中。
    矛盾是只能克服，不能调和！而被克服的又必然是它最腐朽的一面。
    全世界人民对美英强盗，是只能斗争、征讨、歼灭、不能迁就、姑息、畏怯的！让我们齐声高呼：“敌人不放下武器，就消灭它！”
