Xinhua News Agency, 26th: New York Dispatch: American renowned bourgeois columnist Walter Lippmann published an article in the "Today and Tomorrow" column of the "New York Herald Tribune" on July 24, discussing the U.S. government's fear of holding a summit meeting and the dilemma the U.S. has fallen into after invading Lebanon.
    The following is a summary of the article entitled "A Nightmare":
    "In a kind of nightmare, people feel an oppression that forces them to do things they are very reluctant to do. As it stands, the concept of holding a summit meeting in the heart of New York City has the characteristics of this nightmare. Right now, a public meeting between Eisenhower and Khrushchev is a very frightening scenario..."
    "But the fact is: the President has been reluctantly accepting the idea of holding a summit meeting to discuss the Middle East issue under the pressure of the British government, as well as the extensive public opinion in Germany (West Germany), Scandinavia, Japan, and other places. We must ask ourselves, why are Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles now between the devil and the deep blue sea, so that agreeing to hold a meeting is now dangerous, and refusing to hold a meeting is also dangerous?"
    "They are in this dilemma because they have no Middle East policy and have therefore lost the diplomatic initiative. The correct and effective answer to Khrushchev's proposal to hold a summit meeting is neither to simply reject it, nor to accept it and then get entangled in it. The correct answer should have been to propose conditions for solving the problem, including the withdrawal of the Marines, but not limited to that."
    "Unfortunately, we cannot put forward any negotiable solutions. The reason why the U.S. and Britain intervened in Lebanon and Jordan was to prevent their collapse. But this was a hasty reaction after unexpected news came from Iraq, not a well-considered policy action.
    Thus we have reached a dead end. Our dispatching of troops not only has no hope of resolving the revolutionary situation that prompted us to send troops, but the longer the troops are stationed, the more difficult it will be to withdraw the troops without causing the disasters that we wanted to prevent when we initially sent troops."
    "Here (referring to the United States) and in Britain, there is a faction that believes that only a solution achieved after the restoration in Iraq and the elimination of Nasser is an acceptable solution, a solution that can truly solve the problem. They want to do now what Eden and Mollet tried to do in the Suez Canal incident about two years ago. They are prepared to disregard the Soviet Union, and they are willing to use force to establish an Anglo-American protectorate in the Middle East."
    "There is some truth in this view. But those who hold this view were born in the wrong era. Relatively speaking, especially in the Middle East bordering Russia, the Soviet Union is now a power that is incomparably stronger than Tsarist Russia in the 19th century. The Arab revolution simply did not exist in the imperial era of the last century. Moreover, it is imperative not to ignore the need to consider the democratic countries in NATO. Once there is a military showdown due to an Arab country in the Middle East, those democratic countries cannot be expected to keep following along."
    "Therefore, if the days when the West could stabilize the situation in the Middle East through military force are gone forever, we must find ways to reconcile with the new countries in the Middle East, that is, with the Soviet Union and Nasser's federation.
    Besides, can any other policy approaches be imagined? There are no more policy approaches, unless nothing is done, just stick it out in Lebanon and Jordan, and hurl insults at each other with Nasser and Khrushchev. We will fail in this exchange of insults, because it is always easier to condemn intervention than to defend it. So, let's not imagine that we can persevere and tough it out, hoping that the situation will improve."
    The article concludes: "Unless the Lebanese issue is resolved fairly quickly and the Marines are withdrawn, their long-term stationing in Lebanon will embarrass us everywhere in the world. They were sent to prove to the Turks, Pakistanis, and others that we would fulfill our military promises. But if the Marines continue to be stationed and become an occupying force, not only among the guaranteed countries, but also here among ourselves, there will be serious reconsideration.
    Therefore, it is in America's very great interest, and it can be said without exaggeration that it is a matter of vital interest, to enable these Marines to withdraw with dignity through negotiations."

### 一场恶梦、进退两难、到了死胡同  李普曼承认美国侵略者处境十分尴尬

    一场恶梦、进退两难、到了死胡同
    李普曼承认美国侵略者处境十分尴尬
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：美国著名资产阶级专栏作家李普曼7月24日在“纽约先驱论坛报”的“今天和明天”栏里发表一篇文章，论述了美国政府对举行最高级会议的畏惧和美国在侵略黎巴嫩后所陷入的进退维谷的处境。
    这篇题为“一场恶梦”的文章摘要如下：
    “在有一种恶梦里，人们感到一种压迫，迫使他们去作他们非常不愿去作的事情。照目前的情况来看，在纽约市中心举行最高级会议的概念就有着这种恶梦的特点。在现在，艾森豪威尔和赫鲁晓夫公开会见是一个非常可怕的情景……”
    “但是，事实是：总统已经在英国政府以及德国（西德）、斯堪的纳维亚、日本和其他各地的广泛的舆论的前推后拥之下，勉强接受举行最高级会议讨论中东问题的主张。我们必须问自己，为什么艾森豪威尔先生和杜勒斯先生现在处在恶魔和大海之间，以致同意举行会议现在来说是危险的，而拒绝举行会议也是危险的呢”？
    “他们所以会处在这种进退两难的境地是因为他们没有什么中东政策，因而失去了外交上的主动权。对赫鲁晓夫要求举行最高级会议的建议的正确的和有效的答复不是拒绝它了事，也不是接受它而从此纠缠不清。正确的答复本来应该是提出解决问题的条件，其中包括撤退海军陆战队，但是还不限于这一点。”
    “不幸，我们提不出什么可以谈判的解决问题的条件。美英两国所以干涉黎巴嫩和约旦是为了防止它们的崩溃。但是这是伊拉克传来出乎意料的消息以后匆匆忙忙作出的反应，并不是深思熟虑的政策行动。
    因此我们就到了一条死胡同里。我们出兵不仅没有希望解决促使我们出兵的革命形势，而且军队驻扎得越久，也就越不容易把军队撤出而又不致引起当初出兵时想要防止的灾难。”
      “这里（指美国）和英国有一派人认为只有在伊拉克复辟和消灭纳赛尔以后求得的解决办法才是可以接受的、真正能解决什么问题的解决办法。他们是想在现在办到艾登和摩勒两年左右以前在苏伊士事件中想办到的事情。他们准备不顾苏联，他们愿意用武力在中东建立一个英美保护国。”
      “这种看法中有一点道理。但是持有这种看法的人生错了时代。相对地来说，特别是在和俄国接壤的中东，苏联现在是一个比十九世纪的沙俄强大得无法比较的大国。阿拉伯的革命在上一世纪的帝国时代是根本不存在的。并且，决不可忽视必须考虑到北大西洋公约组织中的民主国家。一旦由于中东的一个阿拉伯国家而在军事上摊牌，不能指望那些民主国家一直跟着走。”
    “因此，如果说西方可以通过军事力量稳定中东局势的日子已经一去不复返的话，我们就必须设法同中东新的国家，也就是说同苏联和纳赛尔的联邦和解。
    此外还可以想像出别的什么政策方针吗？再没有什么政策方针，除非什么事都不做，只是在黎巴嫩和约旦坚持下去，并且同纳赛尔和赫鲁晓夫相互进行辱骂。在相互进行辱骂中我们将会失败，因为谴责干涉总是比为干涉辩护要容易。所以，让我们不要幻想我们可以坚持下去并且苦撑到底，希望局面好转。”
    文章最后说：“除非相当快地解决黎巴嫩问题，撤出海军陆战队，否则，他们在黎巴嫩的长期驻扎将使我们在全世界到处难堪。把他们派去是为了向土耳其人、巴基斯坦人和别的人证明，我们是会履行我们的军事诺言的。可是如果海军陆战队继续驻扎下去并且变成一支占领军的话，不仅在得到保证的国家中间，而且就是在这里在我们自己中间，都会认真地重新考虑一下。
    因此，通过谈判使这批海军陆战队能够体面地退出，这对美国是有非常大的利害关系的，也可以毫不夸大地说具有切身利害关系。”
