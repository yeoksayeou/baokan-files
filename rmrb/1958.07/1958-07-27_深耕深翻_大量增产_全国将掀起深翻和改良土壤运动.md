    Deep Ploughing and Deep Turning: Increased Production Substantially
    A National Movement of Deep Turning and Soil Improvement Will Be Launched
    (Our newspaper, Fuyang, 26th) The National On-site Conference on Deep Ploughing Farm Tools and Soil Improvement, which recently closed, proposed to quickly launch a high tide of deep turning and soil improvement throughout the country from now on.
    Currently, 274 million mu of cultivated land nationwide has already been deep ploughed and improved. Judging from the harvesting of crops planted in various places, deep turning the land has a very significant effect on agricultural production increase. Changge County, known throughout the country for its deep turning of land, has conducted comparative tests on corn, millet, cotton, sweet potato, sesame, and tobacco land for three consecutive years, with deep turning and no deep turning. In cultivated land that was deep turned by one to two feet, the crop root systems were particularly strong, the plants grew vigorously, and the yield was one to several times higher than that of land that was not deep turned. In addition, the land of the thirty-plus high-yield wheat "satellites" with yields of 3,000 to 7,300 jin per mu, which have been successively released in Henan Province recently, has a cultivated layer that is about half as deep as that of ordinary land.
    Based on these facts, the conference, after analysis and research, believes that the reason why deep turning the land and improving the soil can greatly increase production is mainly because: it can deepen the loose soil layer, adjust the moisture and air conditions of the soil, increase water storage and fertilizer retention capacity, resist drought and waterlogging; improve soil structure, turn dead soil into living soil, turn bad land into good land, which is conducive to the extension and development of crop roots, take deep roots, and prevent lodging; eradicate weeds and eliminate pests. Thus, the conference came to a conclusion: under the current situation that the problems of farmland water conservancy and fertilizer have been basically solved nationwide, deep turning the land and improving the soil is a fundamental measure to increase agricultural production.
    Therefore, after discussion and research, the conference proposed that from now on, a movement of deep turning the land and improving the soil should be rapidly launched nationwide, just like the vigorous effort to carry out water conservancy last winter and this spring. It is required to work hard in the autumn, plus one winter and one spring, to universally deep plough and improve the more than 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land that needs to be deep turned and improved throughout the country. The general depth should reach about one and a half feet, and two to three feet or more for high-yield fields, and layered fertilization should be carried out so that all poor land is turned into good land. In terms of methods, all localities should conscientiously summarize and promote the experience of the masses, and treat different soils differently.
    The conference believes that, regardless of the method, the following principles should be grasped in deep turning the land and improving the soil: that is, live soil is on top, the soil layer is not disturbed, combined with watering and fertilization, the soil is fundamentally improved, and the fertility is enhanced. At the same time, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and seasons, and not to follow the same pattern, the general purpose is to deep plough and deep turn, and greatly increase production.
    In order to successfully realize the above tasks, the conference suggested that leaders at all levels must take the following measures: 1. Put politics in command and mobilize the whole party and the whole people to carry out a great debate on deep turning the land and improving the soil, so as to unify understanding and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas. 2. Formulate plans at all levels and clarify tasks. It is required that from now on, provinces, cities, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives should adopt a combination of methods, and according to different soil types, crop types, and farming systems, conduct land "queueing," and formulate plans for phased deep turning and improvement of the soil. Seize the two key periods before autumn planting and winter-spring, organize professional teams, and vigorously carry out shock attacks. In the process of summer and autumn harvest, turn as you harvest, turn one mu as you harvest one mu. 3. Vigorously reform farm tools, improve work efficiency, and solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power. The conference proposed that before the autumn harvest and autumn planting, all localities should concentrate their efforts on creating, reforming, and promoting tools for deep ploughing, deep turning, sowing, water lifting, and transportation. At present, deep ploughing and deep turning farm tools should be given priority, and at the same time, they must be carried out in accordance with the standards of deep ploughing and deep turning (one foot to one and a half feet or more). The basic method is to rely on the masses to reform and manufacture themselves; and the industrial and handicraft departments should closely cooperate and vigorously support. All tools that can be installed with ball bearings should be installed with ball bearings. 4. Summarize typical examples in a timely manner, find models, hold on-site meetings, and fully promote them.
    This conference was held in Changge County, Henan Province, and later moved to Fuyang County, Anhui Province. The representatives attending the conference included cadres from party and government departments of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as technicians from agricultural scientific research units and industrial machinery research and manufacturing systems, totaling more than 200 people. Comrade Xiong Yi, a soil science expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also participated in the conference from beginning to end. Gu Dachuan, Vice Minister of Agriculture, made a summary of the conference. (Qu Mingzhen)

### 深耕深翻　大量增产  全国将掀起深翻和改良土壤运动

    深耕深翻　大量增产
    全国将掀起深翻和改良土壤运动
    本报阜阳26日电　最近闭幕的全国深耕农具和改良土壤现场会议，提出从现在起迅速在全国范围内掀起深翻和改良土壤的高潮。
    目前全国已经深翻和改良的耕地达二亿七千四百多万亩。从各地种植的作物收获情况看，深翻土地对农业增产十分显著。以深翻土地闻名全国的长葛县，连续三年作的玉米、谷子、棉花、红薯、芝麻和烟叶地深翻和不深翻的对比试验，凡是深翻一尺到二尺的耕地，作物根系发育特别健壮，植株生长肥旺，产量高出未深翻的一倍或数倍。另外，河南省最近相继放出的三十几个亩产小麦三千至七千三百斤的高额丰产“卫星”的土地，耕作层都比一般地深一半左右。
    会议根据这些事实，经过分析研究认为：深翻土地和改良土壤所以能够大量增产，主要是因为：它可以加深松土层，调节土壤水分和空气的状况，增加蓄水保肥能力，抗旱抗涝；改良土壤结构，死土变活土，坏地变好地，有利于作物根系伸展发育，扎下深根，防止倒伏；根除杂草，消灭虫害。从而会议得出一个结论：在当前全国农田水利、肥料问题基本解决的情况下，深翻土地和改良土壤是农业增产的一项根本措施。
    因此，大会经过讨论研究提出，从现在起要在全国范围内迅速掀起一个像去冬今春搞水利化劲头一样的深翻和改良土壤运动。要求大干一秋，加上一冬一春，把全国需要深翻和改良的十六亿多亩耕地，普遍深耕和改良一遍。一般深度达到一尺五上下，丰产田二、三尺以上，并作到分层施肥，使不良土地全部变成良田。在作法上，各地应当认真总结与推广群众的经验，不同土壤不同对待。
    会议认为，不管那种方法，在深翻土地和改良土壤中，都应掌握如下原则，这就是：活土在上，不乱土层，结合浇水、施肥，从根本上改良土壤，增强地力。同时还要因地因时制宜，不能千篇一律，总的目的是深耕深翻，大量增产。
    为了胜利实现上述任务，大会建议各级领导必须采取以下措施：一、政治挂帅，动员全党全民开展一个深翻土地和改良土壤的大辩论，从而统一认识，克服右倾保守思想。二、层层制定规划，明确任务。要求从现在起，各省、市、县、区、乡、社采取相互结合的办法，根据不同土壤类型、作物种类及耕作制度，进行土地站队，制定分期分批深翻改良土壤的规划。抓住秋种前和冬春两个关键性时期，组织专业队，大力突击。在夏收和秋收过程中，随收随翻，收一亩，翻一亩。三、大力改革农具，提高工效，解决劳畜力不足的困难。会议提出在秋收秋种前，各地应集中力量大搞深耕、深翻、播种、提水、运输等工具的创造、改制和推广工作。当前要把深耕深翻农具放在首要地位，同时，必须按照深耕深翻的标准（一尺至一尺五寸以上）进行。基本办法是依靠群众自改自制；而工业、手工业部门要密切配合，大力支援。一切可以安装滚珠轴承的工具，都要安装滚珠轴承。四、及时总结典型，找出样子，现场开会，全面推开。
    这次会议在河南长葛县召开，后移至安徽阜阳县。出席会议的代表有全国各省、市、自治区党政部门的干部，有农业科学研究单位和工业机械研究制造系统的技术人员，共二百余人。中国科学院土壤学专家熊毅同志也自始至终参加了这次会议。农业部副部长顾大川对会议作了总结。　　　（曲明振）
