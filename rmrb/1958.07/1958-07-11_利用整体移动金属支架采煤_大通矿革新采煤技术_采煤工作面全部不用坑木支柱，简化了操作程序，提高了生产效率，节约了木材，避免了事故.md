Reported by our reporter Tang Tianzhen: A major technological reform in coal mining industrial production – the overall mobile metal support horizontal slicing mining method – has been successfully researched and tested at the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan. The basic characteristics of this mining method are: economical, safe, and simple operating procedures. The preliminary trial of this method at the South Five Trough coal face increased the production capacity of the coal face from the original 122 tons per day and night to 588 tons; the production efficiency per worker per day also increased from the original 3.442 tons to 10.14 tons; the timber consumption rate per thousand tons decreased from the original 24 cubic meters to 1.6 cubic meters; and the production cost per ton of coal also decreased from the original 2.78 yuan to 0.8 yuan. This method can also guarantee safe production.

This method is of great significance for developing the coal mining industry in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. After the Datong Coal Mine fully implements this method, it can reduce the number of production personnel by 754 this year, accounting for 37% of the total number of existing workers in the mine, while increasing coal production by 70,000 tons compared to last year; the annual timber consumption can be reduced by 45% compared to last year, saving a total of 9,904 cubic meters of timber; the cost of wages and timber can be saved by 1.72 million yuan, equivalent to 46.7% of last year's wage and timber costs. Just increasing the coal recovery rate (from the original 84.8% to 92%) can increase the nation's coal production by more than 47,000 tons per year.

The overall mobile metal support is made of ordinary steel and is installed on the coal face to replace timber supports as cover. The back of the support is made into a sliding plate shape, with a layer of iron plate installed on it; the front of the sliding plate is supported by an iron frame, and the uppermost part is made into an approximately semi-circular shape so that the upper part easily slides at the contact point with the false roof; the bottom of the frame is made in a sled shape for uniform force and easy movement. The entire frame is composed of small parts, which is convenient for underground moving, dismantling, and installation. Its structure is very simple and can be designed according to different coal seams and geological conditions. The manufacturing cost is low, but the utilization rate is very high. If used in ordinary small coal kilns, the frame can be made of hard wood, and the cost is even lower.

The adoption of overall mobile metal support mining at the Datong Coal Mine has fundamentally changed the production appearance of the coal face. Previously, every time a section of coal was mined, workers had to erect many supports on the coal face, and after this section of coal was mined, the pillars were recovered one by one. Carelessness could also lead to workface collapse accidents. Now, the coal face completely eliminates the need for timber supports, eliminating the heavy physical labor and complicated work procedures such as supporting and recovering pillars and lowering the bottom beam. Each time a section of coal is mined, the metal support is pulled forward from the outside with traction equipment, continuing to provide cover for the new coal face. Because the metal support has a large compressive force, it can tightly control the roof and floor, and completely isolate the mined-out area from the coal face, avoiding the danger of roof collapse and gangue ejection. It is very safe for workers to mine coal inside the metal support.

In the past, timber consumed at the coal face accounted for more than 70% of the total timber consumption. Now, the use of overall mobile metal supports has greatly reduced the timber consumption per thousand tons of coal. In the past, the net coal mining time for three shifts of workers a day and night was only six and a half hours, and the remaining more than seventeen hours were spent on complicated work such as setting up supports, recovering supports, and lowering bottom beams; now, workers can devote themselves fully to coal mining. Due to the increase in coal mining time, coal mining efficiency has increased by at least two times. Metal supports prevent gangue from mixing into the coal, thus greatly improving the quality of coal mining.

Currently, the staff and workers of the Datong Coal Mine are continuing to study and improve this mining method. They want to transform the fixed support into a freely retractable movable support so that the support can change freely according to the width and height of the coal seam. Currently, moving the support still requires using a "chain hoist" for external traction. They plan to install traction equipment inside the support; after the installation is successful, the coal miner only needs to press a button inside the support, and it can automatically move forward. The staff and workers confidently believe that as long as they continue to research and improve, it can make the production of the coal face fully mechanized and automated.

The overall mobile metal support horizontal slicing mining method was researched and created by Comrade Liu Lixun, the party secretary of this mine, together with the staff and workers through experimental plots.

    利用整体移动金属支架采煤
    大通矿革新采煤技术
    采煤工作面全部不用坑木支柱，简化了操作程序，提高了生产效率，节约了木材，避免了事故
    本报讯　记者汤天真报道：煤矿工业生产的一项重大技术改革——整体移动金属支架水平分层采煤法，在淮南大通煤矿研究试验成功。这一采煤方法的基本特点是：经济、安全和操作程序简单。这个矿南五槽采煤场初步试用这一方法，采煤工作面的生产能力，就由原来一昼夜产煤一百二十二吨增加到五百八十八吨；每工每天的生产效率，也由原来的三点四四二吨提高到十点一四吨；坑木千吨消耗率由原来的二十四立方公尺下降到一点六立方公尺；每吨煤的生产成本也由原来的两元七、八角降到八角。这种方法还可以保证安全生产。
    这一方法对多快好省地发展煤矿工业有重大的意义。大通煤矿全部推行这一方法以后，今年在比去年增产七万吨煤的情况下，可以减少生产人员七百五十四人，占全矿现有工人总数的37％；全年的坑木消耗可比去年减少45％，共节省坑木九千九百零四立方公尺；工资和坑木的成本费用可以节省一百七十二万元，相当于去年工资和坑木成本费用的46.7％。仅是提高煤的回采率（由原来的84.8％提高到92％），一年就可以多为国家增产四万七千多吨煤。
    整体移动金属支架是用普通的钢材做成的，安装在采煤工作面上代替坑木支柱作掩护。支架的背面做成滑板形式，上面安装一层铁板；滑板的前面用铁架子支撑，最上部做成近似半圆形，以便上部同假顶接触处容易滑行；架子下面做成雪撬模样，受力均匀，移动方便。整个架子是由一些小部件组合而成，便于井下搬、拆和安装。它的构造很简单，可以根据不同的煤层和地质情况设计。制造成本低，使用率却很高。如在一般小煤窑使用，架子用坚硬的木料就可以，成本费更低。
    大通煤矿采用整体移动金属支架采煤，根本改变了采煤工作面的生产面貌。以前，每采一段煤，工人就要在采煤工作面打起许多支柱，这段煤采完以后，又把柱子一根根回收出来。不小心还会发生垮工作面事故。现在，采煤工作面完全不用坑木支柱，取消了支柱和回柱等笨重的体力劳动和繁杂的工作程序。每采完一段煤，只要在外面用牵引设备一拉，金属支架就向前移动，继续为新的采煤工作面做掩护。由于金属支架的抗压力大，可以严密地控制着顶板、底板，而且把已采空的地方同采煤工作面绝然隔开，避免了顶板垮落和矸石外窜的危险。工人站在金属支架内采煤非常安全。
    过去采煤工作面消耗的坑木，占全部坑木消耗量的70％以上，现在采用整体移动金属支架，使每千吨煤的坑木消耗量大大降低。过去一昼夜三班工人的纯采煤时间只有六个半小时，其余十七个多小时都用在打支柱、回收支柱和下底梁等复杂的工作上；现在，工人可以全力投入采煤工作了。由于采煤时间增加，采煤效率最少提高两倍多。金属支架使外窜矸石不能混到煤里，因而也大大提高了采煤质量。
    目前，大通煤矿的职工正在继续研究改进这一采煤方法。他们要把死的支架改制成自由伸缩的活动支架，使支架可以根据煤层的宽窄和高低而变化自如。现在要移动支架，还是用“神仙葫芦”在外面牵引，他们准备在支架里安装牵引设备；安装成功以后，采煤工只要在支架内按动一下电钮，它就可以自动地向前移动。职工们满怀信心地认为：只要继续不断地研究改进，它就能够使采煤工作面的生产全部机械化和自动化。
    整体移动金属支架水平分层采煤法，是这个矿的党委书记刘立勋同志通过搞试验田同职工一起研究创造的。
