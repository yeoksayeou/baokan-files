Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 27th: Jinshan County has become the first county in Jiangsu Province to achieve 1,000 jin of early rice. The 89,000 mu of early rice in Jinshan County have been successively harvested and brought to the threshing ground. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield of early rice per mu in the county can reach 1,200 jin. This is 772 jin higher than the average yield of 428 jin per mu of early rice in the county last year, and twice as high as the usual late rice yield.

The large-scale bumper harvest of early rice in Jinshan County this year is the result of the 200,000 people of the county, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, breaking down superstition, liberating their minds, exerting their utmost efforts, working hard and practically, and waging a tenacious struggle against all kinds of conservative ideas and practical difficulties. In order to ensure a high yield of early rice, the people of the county, after debate, universally implemented the measures of deep plowing to six inches, dense planting of 50,000 holes, 500 dan of base fertilizer, and four or five top dressings, and launched communist competitions under the leadership of cadre experimental plots. In order to sow and plant early and ensure a bumper harvest in both seasons, early rice sowing this year was advanced by one week compared to previous years. In order to overcome the early spring low temperatures and late frost, three-proof facilities (frost-proof, wind-proof, rain-proof) were built in the seedling fields, covering them with cinder and straw curtains to cultivate early and strong seedlings. During transplanting, some seedlings were short, so the method of planting seedlings with shovels was promoted, so that seedlings of two or three inches long could also be transplanted, gaining time. In mid-June, there was a prolonged drought with no rain, and the drought was serious, affecting the heading of early rice. An anti-drought and seedling-protecting campaign was launched throughout the county, mobilizing the whole party and all the people, organizing manpower to draw water day and night to rescue the rice seedlings, and overcoming the drought. In late June, early rice suffered from rice blast of the panicle and stem. Continuous spraying was immediately organized to treat and save the rice, and it was quickly extinguished, which is why today’s bumper harvest was achieved.

With the bumper harvest of early rice, the revolutionary faction raised their eyebrows and breathed freely, while the "wait-and-see" faction and the "reckoning-after-the-harvest" faction had to admit defeat in the face of the facts of the bumper harvest. Chen Binghui, an upper-middle peasant in the sixth team of the Liming Cooperative, said when planting early rice, "The Great Leap Forward is empty enthusiasm," and said, "Cadres have no hair on their lips and speak empty words." Now the team’s 115 mu of early rice has an average yield of 1,901 jin per mu. He said: "Now conservative ideas are no longer working!"

### 江苏第一个早稻千斤县——金山县

    江苏第一个早稻千斤县——金山县
    新华社南京27日电　江苏省出现了第一个早稻千斤县。金山县八万九千亩早稻已经陆续收割登场，据初步统计，全县早稻平均亩产可达到一千二百斤，这比去年全县早稻平均单产四百二十八斤高出七百七十二斤，比往年晚稻提高一倍。
    金山县今年的早稻大面积丰收，是全县二十万人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，苦干实干，和各种保守思想和实际困难作顽强斗争的结果。为了保证早稻高额丰产，全县人民经过辩论，普遍贯彻了深耕六寸、密植五万穴、基肥五百担、追肥四、五次的增产措施，并在干部试验田的带动下，开展了共产主义竞赛。为了早播早栽，保证两季丰收，今年早稻播种比往年提前一个星期。为了战胜早春低温、晚霜冰冻，在秧田里搞了防霜、防风、防雨三防设备，盖毛灰和草帘，培育了早壮秧苗。在移栽中，有些秧苗较短，又推广了栽铲秧的办法，使二、三寸长的秧苗也能移栽，赢得了时间。在6月中旬，久旱不雨，旱情严重，影响了早稻孕穗，在全县范围内开展了全党动手全民动员的抗旱保苗运动，组织人力昼夜车水抢救稻苗，战胜了干旱。在6月下旬，早稻又发生了穗茎稻热病，随即组织连续喷药救治，迅速扑灭，才获得了今天的丰收。
    早稻大丰收，革命派扬眉吐气，观潮派、秋后算账派在丰产事实面前只好服输。黎明社第六队上中农陈炳辉在早稻布秧时讲“大跃进是空劲头”，说“干部嘴上没毛，说话空头空脑”。现在该队一百一十五亩早稻平均亩产一千九百零一斤，他说：“现在保守思想不行了！”
