Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26th: Representatives of women from all walks of life in Chongqing held a rally on the 25th, braving the scorching heat, to strongly protest against the US and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. Participants in the meeting included mothers whose sons were killed by US imperialism, women who became blind due to imperialist persecution, female workers, female farmers, childcare workers, and female Muslims.

At the protest rally, women representatives actively requested to speak. Jin Yonghua, a relative of a martyr, said: "My eldest son was killed by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang at the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. I have never forgotten this blood feud. When US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, I immediately sent my second son to be a volunteer soldier. If US and British imperialism do not immediately stop their aggression against the Middle East, I will send my third son out." She said, I hate war very much, because war will cause many mothers to lose their children and wives to lose their husbands. But I am also absolutely not afraid of war.

The woman, Qin Shuyun, who was blinded by imperialists, said angrily at the beginning: "Before liberation, tens of thousands of women and children in China were deprived of their lives and happiness by imperialism, and some became disabled. My eyes were blinded by the inhuman imperialists with sulfur smoke. Now US and British imperialism want to impose the deep disasters that were once imposed on Chinese women on our Arab sisters, adding new hatred to my old hatred. I will never allow warmongers to do this."

Li Shihui, a female worker from the China Wool Textile Factory, and Zhang Zefang, a female member of the Labor Production Cooperative, said in their speeches that if US and British imperialism dare to expand the war, we must eliminate the small handful of warmongers from the earth, just like eliminating the four pests. Liang Zhongyu, a young female scientific worker, said: Many scientific technologies and defense industries in socialist countries have surpassed those of US and British imperialism. If they dare to launch a war, they are destined to perish in the war.

    不准把战争灾难强加在阿拉伯姊妹身上
    重庆市妇女抗议美英侵略
    新华社重庆26日电　重庆市各界妇女代表25日冒着酷暑举行集会，强烈抗议美、英帝国主义侵略中东。参加大会的有被美帝国主义残杀了儿子的母亲、有因受帝国主义残害而双目失明的妇女、有女工、女农民、保育工作者、女穆斯林等。
    在抗议大会上，妇女代表们都积极要求发言。烈属金永华说：“我的大儿子是在中美合作所被美帝国主义和蒋匪帮残害死的，我一刻也没有忘记这个血海深仇。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争时，我立刻将我的第二个儿子送去当志愿军。如果美英帝国主义不立即停止对中东的侵略，我将叫我的第三个儿子出去。”她说，我非常痛恨战争，因为战争会使许多母亲失掉孩子，妻子失掉丈夫。但我也绝不怕战争。
    被帝国主义者害成双目失明的妇女覃淑芸，一开头便愤怒地说：“解放前我们中国成千成万的妇女、儿童被帝国主义夺去了生命和幸福，有些人变成了残废。我这双眼睛就是被惨无人道的帝国主义者用硫磺烟熏瞎了的。现在美英帝国主义又想把曾经加在中国妇女身上的深重灾难强加在阿拉伯的姊妹们身上，使我在旧仇上又添上了新恨。我绝不允许战争贩子们这样做。”
    中国毛纺织厂女工李世惠、劳动生产合作社的女社员张泽芳在发言中说，如果美、英帝国主义胆敢扩大战争，我们就一定要像消灭四害那样，把一小撮战争贩子从地球上消灭干净。女青年科学工作者梁锺璵说：社会主义国家许多科学技术和国防工业都超过了美英帝国主义，他们胆敢发动战争，就注定要在战争中灭亡。
