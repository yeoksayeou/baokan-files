Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th - US President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress on the 15th regarding the US military intervention in Lebanon. In his message, he reported to Congress on the actions already taken and made every effort to justify the US government's actions of aggression against Lebanon and interference in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern people.

In order to find a "legal" basis for this blatant act of aggression, the message emphasized that the United States deployed troops at the so-called "urgent request" of Shamun, the lackey of imperialism. Eisenhower then shamelessly described the mission of this invading force as "to protect the lives of Americans" and "to help the Lebanese government maintain the territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon." According to Eisenhower himself, there are only about two thousand five hundred American expatriates in Lebanon.

The message deliberately portrayed the struggle of Lebanese nationalist forces against the traitorous Shamun government as some kind of "indirect aggression from the outside" and slandered the United Arab Republic. Here, Eisenhower did not dare to mention a word about the report submitted by the United Nations observer group, manipulated by the United States, on the situation in Lebanon. The observer group's report stated that they could not find any evidence of interference by the United Arab Republic in the internal affairs of Lebanon.

Eisenhower's message admitted that fear of the enormous impact of the Iraqi revolution on the Middle East situation was the main reason for the US to take armed aggression in Lebanon. The message said that due to the "riots that occurred in Baghdad, Iraq, adjacent to (Lebanon), on July 14, the situation (in the Middle East) fundamentally changed." "After careful consideration, I (Eisenhower) have determined that, in light of the developments in Iraq, the measures taken so far by the United Nations Security Council are insufficient to safeguard the independence and integrity of Lebanon."

The final part of the message talked about the United States' determination to engage in military adventures. The message stated that the US government is "aware" of the "serious consequences that may arise from the steps currently being taken," but he believes that such actions are necessary to maintain the "international order" required by the United States.

On the same day, Eisenhower also delivered a radio address on the US military intervention in Lebanon, attempting to mobilize domestic public opinion to support the US government's unjust act of aggression. He demanded that the American people accept the American aggression in Lebanon and arrogantly claimed to be "prepared to deal with the situation, regardless of the consequences."

### 美总统向国会提出特别咨文  为美国侵略行动狡辩

    美总统向国会提出特别咨文
    为美国侵略行动狡辩
    据新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔15日就美国出兵侵略黎巴嫩向国会提出特别咨文。他在咨文中向国会报告了已经采取的行动，并且竭力为美国政府侵略黎巴嫩和干涉中东人民内政的行动辩解。
    为了替美国的这种明目张胆的侵略行为寻找“法律”根据，咨文强调美国是应帝国主义的走狗夏蒙的所谓“紧急请求”而出兵的。艾森豪威尔接着恬不知耻地把这支侵略部队的任务说成是“为了保障美国人的生命”和“帮助黎巴嫩政府维护黎巴嫩的领土完整和独立”。据艾森豪威尔自己说，在黎巴嫩境内总共只有约二千五百个美国侨民。
    咨文故意把黎巴嫩民族主义力量反对卖国的夏蒙政府的斗争说成是什么“来自外界的间接侵略”，并且污蔑阿拉伯联合共和国。在这里，艾森豪威尔对于在美国操纵下联合国派出的观察小组不久前就黎巴嫩情况提出的报告不敢提一个字。这个观察小组的报告中说，他们找不到阿拉伯联合共和国干涉黎巴嫩内政的任何证据。
    艾森豪威尔的咨文承认，害怕伊拉克革命对于中东局势所产生的巨大影响是促使美国在黎巴嫩采取武装侵略行动的主要原因。咨文说，由于“7月14日在邻近（黎巴嫩）的伊拉克的巴格达发生了暴动，（中东）形势根本改变”。“经过周密的考虑以后，我（艾森豪威尔）已经断定，从伊拉克的事态发展来看，联合国安全理事会到目前为止所采取的措施不足以维护黎巴嫩的独立和完整”。
    咨文的最后一部分谈到美国从事军事冒险的决心。咨文说：美国政府对于“现在正在采取的步骤可能产生的严重后果”，是“认识到的”，但是他认为，为了维持美国所需要的“国际秩序”，需要采取这种行动。
    同一天，艾森豪威尔还就美国出兵侵略黎巴嫩的行动发表了广播演说，企图动员国内舆论来支持美国政府非正义的侵略行动。他要求美国人民接受美国在黎巴嫩的侵略行动，并狂妄地声称“准备应付局势，不管后果如何”。
