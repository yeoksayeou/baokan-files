Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Theoretical journals established by provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional Party committees have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of cadres and people. The circulation of most journals exceeds 100,000 copies.

The "Liberation" magazine, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, was published on July 1st, and more than 350,000 copies were sold by the 8th. On the first day of publication of the inaugural issue, workers and cadres throughout the city rushed to buy and read it. Employees of the Shanghai Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory purchased more than 200 copies in a short lunch break. Almost all workers participating in the philosophy study group at the Qiu Xin Shipyard purchased the "Liberation" magazine. The "East Wind" monthly magazine, sponsored by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, was originally planned to print only 50,000 copies, but it could not meet the needs of readers. The circulation has now increased to 115,000 copies. After the first batch of publications were transported to Ninghe, Xushui, Cangxian and other county towns, they were sold out within two or three days. The inaugural issue of "Ideological Front," sponsored by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, also exceeded the original planned circulation of 100,000 copies. After the publication of "Zhongzhou Review," sponsored by the Henan Provincial Party Committee, many government cadres conducted ideological criticism in light of reality based on the articles in the journal, and some units even included reading "Zhongzhou Review" as part of their personal red-and-expert planning. After the publication of "Theoretical Study," sponsored by the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, many government cadres established study groups to collectively read and discuss it. The editorial department of "Theoretical Study" magazine has received letters from government cadres, workers, agricultural cooperative members, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and school teachers and staff, talking about their gains after reading. This journal circulated 125,000 copies when it was published on July 1st.

The sales volume of "Advance" sponsored by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, "Leap Forward" sponsored by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, "Practice" sponsored by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee, and "Red and Expert" sponsored by the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee have all increased rapidly.

The broad masses of readers support the work of the journals in various ways. After the publication of "Seeking Truth," sponsored by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, many county Party committees established writing groups to write articles for the journal. This journal has been distributed to 265,000 copies. Within a few days of the publication of "Struggle," sponsored by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, the editorial department received more than 60 articles from readers, of which articles written by workers and peasants accounted for about one-quarter.
