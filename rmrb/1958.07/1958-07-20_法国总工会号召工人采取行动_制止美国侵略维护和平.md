Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communique on the 16th, opposing U.S. intervention in Lebanon, and calling on workers and all trade union organizations to unite as widely as possible, and to do everything possible to immediately protest the U.S. intervention, expressing their unwavering determination to maintain international peace.

The Executive Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor pointed out that the de Gaulle government has announced its support for U.S. policy. The Executive Bureau said: A government that represents the French people's desire for peace should not support such intervention, but should participate in and take the initiative in all efforts that have been or may be made to stop such intervention under the pressure of people all over the world, just as the British and French intervention in Egypt was stopped.

The Executive Bureau called on all workers to take action against France's participation in any intervention in the Middle East.

    据新华社讯　法国总工会执行局16日发表公报，反对美国干涉黎巴嫩，并且号召劳动者和所有工会组织最广泛地团结一致，通过一切方法竭尽全力立即对美国的干涉提出抗议，表示他们不屈不挠地维护国际和平的决心。
    总工会执行局指出，戴高乐政府已宣布支持美国政策。执行局说：凡是代表法国人民和平愿望的政府，就不应该支持这种干涉，就应该参加已经作出或可能作出的一切努力并采取主动以使这种干涉在全世界人民的压力下受到制止，正如英国和法国干涉埃及时那样。
    执行局号召全体劳动者采取行动，反对法国参加在中东进行任何干涉。
