    Notes
    The More One Tries, the Less Competent One Becomes
    The "Times" published a report titled "Training New African Leaders," discussing the situation of some colleges established by imperialist countries in African colonies. The material in this article shows that almost every African colony has a so-called "college."

    Does this mean that imperialist countries are truly "concerned" about education in the colonies? Of course not. What imperialism cares about is always how to intensify the exploitation and plunder of the colonies, and the purpose of running these so-called "colleges" is no different. The title of the "Times" article clearly reveals the secret. The so-called "training of new African leaders" is essentially nothing more than cultivating "agents" of imperialism in the colonies by running colleges.

    However, this intention of imperialism often backfires. The vast majority of the younger generation in the colonies, impacted by the wave of national independence movements, are not willing to be slaves and "agents" of imperialism. On the contrary, they are determined to dedicate themselves to the cause of the independence movement. For example, Makerere College in Uganda, which the "Times" boasts about, saw its students conduct a long struggle for national independence and become an important force in the Ugandan national independence movement. The same situation exists in other colonial areas of Africa.

    In an era of rising national independence movements of colonial peoples, all the methods used by imperialism to maintain colonial rule are bound to be futile and self-defeating.

    Unable to Conceal the Ugliness
    When West German President Heuss visited the United States not long ago, the "New York Times" vigorously praised him, saying that he had voted against authorizing Hitler in the Weimar Republic parliament, etc., portraying Heuss as an anti-Hitler hero.

    But recently, a reader of the "New York Times" exposed this lie. He pointed out that Heuss did not vote against authorizing Hitler to take power in the Weimar Republic parliament, but voted in favor.

    The "New York Times"'s attempt to cover up for Heuss is obviously both futile and clumsy. Because it is already an open secret that those former followers of Hitler and Nazis are once again making a comeback on the West German political stage. If you look at the old records of these West German figures in power, none of them has a clean history. In this regard, Adenauer once said very frankly: "Now we should stop asking who is a Nazi, because once this starts, there will be no end to it." The "New York Times" wanted to whitewash the Nazis, but the result was a disgrace.

    札记
    心劳日拙
    “泰晤士报”以“训练非洲的新领袖”为题，报道了帝国主义国家在非洲殖民地设立的一些学院的情况。这篇文章的材料表明，几乎非洲每个殖民地，都有一个所谓的“学院”。
    这是不是说帝国主义国家真的“关心”殖民地的教育事业呢？当然不是。帝国主义所关心的永远只是如何加紧对殖民地的剥削和掠夺，兴办所谓“学院”，目的也并不两样。“泰晤士报”文章的标题，就明明白白地道出了此中的奥妙。所谓“训练非洲的新领袖”，实质上不过是通过兴办学院来培养帝国主义在殖民地的“代理人”而已。
    可是，帝国主义的这种用心往往只能适得其反。殖民地青年一代的绝大多数，由于受到民族独立运动浪潮的冲击，他们不但不甘心充当帝国主义的奴仆和“代理人”，相反的却坚决地献身于争取独立运动的事业。例如，“泰晤士报”所吹嘘的乌干达的梅克里尔学院，那里的学生为争取民族独立进行了长期的斗争，并成为乌干达民族独立运动的一支重要力量。在非洲的其他殖民地地方也有着同样的情况。
    在殖民地人民民族独立运动高涨的时代里，帝国主义企图维持殖民统治的一切手法都必然是心劳日拙。
    遮不了丑
    西德总统豪斯不久前访问美国时，“纽约时报”曾经替他大事吹嘘，说他过去在魏玛共和国议会中曾投票拒绝授权希特勒，等等，把豪斯打扮成一个反希特勒的英雄。
    但是最近“纽约时报”一位读者揭穿了这个谎言。他指出，豪斯当时在魏玛共和国议会中在授权希特勒当政问题上，投的不是反对票，而是赞成票。
    “纽约时报”为豪斯遮丑的做法显然是既徒然而又笨拙。因为那些过去的希特勒的信徒和纳粹分子们今天又在西德政治舞台上重新粉墨登场，这早已是公开的秘密了。翻一翻这些西德当权人物的老账没有一个人的历史是干净的。在这方面阿登纳过去曾经说得很坦率：“现在我们应该停止打听谁是纳粹分子了，因为这件事一旦开端，就会没有止境的。”“纽约时报”本想为纳粹分子涂脂抹粉，但结果却是丢了丑。
