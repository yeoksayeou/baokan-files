Accomplices of the Aggressors
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

While world opinion is unanimously condemning the U.S. and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, the West German Adenauer government issued a statement on the 23rd, openly expressing "unconditional support" for the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East. This completely exposes the Adenauer government's willingness to follow the U.S. and Britain as an accomplice of the aggressors.

The Adenauer government's role as an accomplice of the colonialists did not begin today. In the past, during the Suez crisis and the French suppression of the Algerian national liberation movement, most of the foreign troops used by France were recruited in West Germany with the tacit consent of the West German government. This time, the West German government has handed over its largest airport to the U.S. aggressor troops as a springboard for deploying troops to invade Lebanon. However, why did the West German government delay until the 23rd to come out and support the U.S. and British acts of aggression?

Obviously, this is also a struggle between imperialist countries. When the U.S. and Britain launched their aggression in the Middle East, they were bent on dominating the Near and Middle East, and therefore did not consult with West Germany and Italy beforehand. Even France, which rushed to send warships to "help," was turned away by the United States. However, things did not go as smoothly as the U.S. and British imperialists had imagined. Their acts of aggression were condemned by the world, and they did not even receive sympathy within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In order to get rid of this extremely isolated predicament, the U.S. aggressors tried their best to find some pitiful supporters. Therefore, after the West German government's statement was issued, Dulles immediately "expressed satisfaction" and announced that he would hold talks with Adenauer. Prior to this, the United States also announced that it would invite Italian Prime Minister Fanfani to visit the United States. There is no doubt that the purpose of these talks and visits is to further encourage West Germany and Italy to support the U.S. and British acts of aggression. But can the U.S. aggressors, by joining forces with the Adenauer government, which is committed to reviving German militarism, plus Italy, stem the surging tide of the world's people against aggression? Can they escape the severe condemnation of world public opinion? Can they make their unjust acts of aggression seem more just? This approach precisely reveals that the U.S. aggressors are still preparing to expand their aggression.

For the Adenauer government, its support for the U.S. and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has shattered its hypocritical pose of neutrality in the past few days. The West German government's original disguise was nothing more than playing a double game, in order to more easily intervene in the Near and Middle East and actively expand its own influence in the Middle East.

The Adenauer government's open support for the actions of the U.S. and British aggressors is contrary to the vital interests of the vast German people. Broad public opinion in West Germany, including bourgeois newspapers and political leaders, is also dissatisfied with the U.S. and British armed aggression in the Middle East. As the influential bourgeois newspaper "Die Welt" criticized: the U.S. and British "war action is a regrettable adventure"; they are "swimming against the tide of history." Now the West German government wants to drag West Germany into this regrettable adventure, which will inevitably be strongly opposed by the broad masses of the people and public opinion, and will once again educate the West German people to recognize the imperialist essence of the Adenauer government. The Adenauer government's warmongering policies will only lead the German people back to new disasters.

    侵略者的帮凶
    本报评论员
    在全世界舆论同声斥责美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩、约旦的时候，西德阿登纳政府却在23日发表声明，公然表示“无条件支持”美英在中东的侵略行动。这就完全暴露了阿登纳政府甘愿跟随美英之后充当侵略者的帮凶的面目。
    阿登纳政府充当殖民主义者的帮凶并不从今天开始。过去在苏伊士事件中以及法国镇压阿尔及利亚民族解放运动中法国所用的外籍军队，大部分都是经西德政府默许而在西德招募的。这次西德政府又把最大的机场交给美国侵略军作为调兵遣将侵入黎巴嫩的跳板。但是，西德政府对于美英侵略行动却拖延到23日才出面予以支持，其中奥妙何在呢？
    很明显，这也是帝国主义国家之间的一场明争暗斗。当美英发动侵略中东之初，一心想独霸中近东，因之，并没有事先关照西德和意大利，甚至连法国赶着派了军舰去“助威”，也被美国挡驾。可是事情并不像美英帝国主义所想像的那么顺利，它们的侵略行为遭到全世界的谴责，甚至在北大西洋集团内部也得不到同情。为了摆脱这种极端孤立的困境，美国侵略者就竭力企图寻找一些可怜的支持者。因此，当西德政府声明发表以后，杜勒斯立即“表示满意”，并宣布要跟阿登纳进行会谈。在此以前，美国还宣布将邀请意大利总理范范尼去美国访问。没有疑问的，这些会谈和访问的目的，无非是要西德和意大利进一步支持美英的侵略行为。但是美国侵略者把正在以复活德国军国主义为己任的阿登纳政府拉在一起，再加上意大利，就能够挡住全世界人民反侵略的汹涌浪潮吗？就能够逃脱世界公正舆论的严厉谴责吗？就能够使他们非正义的侵略活动变得正义一些吗？这种做法，恰恰暴露了：美国侵略者至今还在准备扩大侵略。
    对于阿登纳政府来说，它支持美英对黎巴嫩、约旦的侵略行动，已经把它前几天假惺惺地保持中立的姿态拆穿了。西德政府原先的伪装，不过是玩弄两面手法，为的更便于它插手中近东，积极在中东扩张自己的势力而已。
    阿登纳政府公然支持美英侵略者的行动，是违背广大德国人民的切身利益的。西德的广大舆论，包括资产阶级报纸和政治领袖在内也不满意美英在中东的武装侵略。就像有影响的资产阶级报纸“世界报”曾指责的：美英的“战争行动是一场可悲的冒险”；他们是在“逆着历史的潮流游泳”。现在西德政府要把西德拖入这一场可悲的冒险中去，必然会遭到广大人民和舆论的强烈反对，并且又一次教育西德人民认识到阿登纳政府的帝国主义实质。阿登纳政府的好战政策，只会把德国人民重新引到新的灾难中去。
