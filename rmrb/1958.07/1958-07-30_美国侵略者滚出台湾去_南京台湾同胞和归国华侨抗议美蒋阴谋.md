Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. Taiwanese compatriots and returned overseas Chinese in Nanjing protested against the armed aggression of US-British imperialism in the Middle East and the US imperialism's instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan area. They held rallies on the 25th and 26th respectively, resolutely demanding that the US-British aggressors get out of the Middle East, and the American aggressors get out of our territory, Taiwan.

Han Feifeng, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a Taiwan compatriot, said that the people of Taiwan must inherit the glorious tradition of the "February 28th" incident, and together with their compatriots in the motherland, under the leadership of the Party, actively support the just struggle of the Arab people, and must liberate Taiwan. Zhang Chenhuan, a member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, expressed the firm support of returned overseas Chinese for the just struggle of the Arab people. Zheng Zhengyong, an assistant engineer from Taiwan at the Nanjing Chemical Plant, said: We must not stand idly by to the piratical acts of the US-British aggressors. Eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still in dire straits. Therefore, we deeply sympathize with and support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East. He expressed his determination to do his utmost to strengthen the motherland's strength and stop the aggression of US-British imperialism.

Taiwanese compatriots and returned overseas Chinese also pointed out at the rally that the people of Taiwan had suffered decades of bloody rule by Japanese imperialism. Today, the Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to run rampant in Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan and drive the American aggressors out of our territory.
