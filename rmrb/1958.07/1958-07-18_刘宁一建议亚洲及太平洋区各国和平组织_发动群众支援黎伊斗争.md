Xinhua News Agency, July 17th -- Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, telegraphed today to the Peace Committees of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, suggesting that the peace committees of various countries launch public opinion and mobilize the masses to support the just struggle of the Lebanese, Iraqi and Arab people, force the United States and Britain to immediately withdraw their intervention troops, and urgently safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world.

Liu Ningyi's telegram stated: The American aggressors, in blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, under the pretext of "protecting American nationals" and "defending Lebanese sovereignty," have dispatched armed forces to land in Lebanon, armed interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, and are threatening the Republic of Iraq. British troops have also invaded Jordan today, preparing to carry out armed intervention against the Republic of Iraq. The situation is extremely serious. This aggressive action by the United States and Britain is seriously threatening peace in the Middle East and the world.

The telegram said, we suggest that your national committee consider: rapidly launching public opinion and the broad masses of the people to support the just struggle of the Lebanese, Iraqi, and Arab peoples, and taking various effective measures to force the United States and Britain to immediately withdraw their intervention troops, so as to urgently safeguard peace in the Middle East and the world.

    刘宁一建议亚洲及太平洋区各国和平组织
    发动群众支援黎伊斗争
    新华社17日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书长刘宁一今天打电报给亚洲及太平洋区域各国和平委员会，建议各国和平委员会发动舆论和人民群众声援黎巴嫩、伊拉克和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，迫使美、英立即撤退干涉军队，紧急维护中东和世界的和平。
    刘宁一的电报说：美国侵略者公然违反联合国宪章的根本原则，在“保护美国侨民”和“保卫黎巴嫩主权”的借口下，派遣武装部队在黎巴嫩登陆，武装干涉黎巴嫩内政，对伊拉克共和国进行威胁。英国军队也已经在今天侵入约旦，准备对伊拉克共和国进行武装干涉。现在局势异常严重。美国和英国这种侵略行动正严重地威胁着中东和世界的和平。
    电报说，我们建议贵国和委会考虑：迅速发动舆论和广大人民群众，声援黎巴嫩、伊拉克和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，采取各种有效措施，迫使美国和英国立即撤退干涉军队。这样，来紧急维护中东和世界的和平。
