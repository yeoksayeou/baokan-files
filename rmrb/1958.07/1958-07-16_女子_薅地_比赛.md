A women's "weeding" competition

(Reported by this newspaper) Recently, Yong'an Cooperative in Haixing Township, Acheng County, Heilongjiang Province, held a lively sports meet.

There were many events at this sports meet, including men's and women's basketball, tug-of-war, women's 400-meter relay race, and speeches on the General Line; but the most attractive event was the "weeding" competition, in which nineteen women participated.

In a field of millet with many weeds and dense seedlings, the twenty-minute competition began. The nineteen female warriors strove to be the best, concentrating intently as they bent deeply at the waist and moved forward. Cong Yunshu, an eighteen-year-old high school graduate, was already covered in sweat, but no matter what, she could not catch up with the fifty-seven-year-old Grandma Yu Shuqing. Grandma Yu's two hands were pulling weeds and thinning seedlings at lightning speed, and when the time was up, she had left all her opponents behind.

After evaluation, everyone unanimously agreed that Grandma Yu Shuqing had weeded the most land, the fastest, and the best, so she won the championship in this weeding competition.

    女子“薅地”比赛
    本报讯　最近黑龙江阿城县海兴乡永安社举行了一次热闹的运动会。
    这个运动会的比赛项目很多，有男、女篮球，拔河，女子四百公尺接力赛跑，也有总路线演讲比赛；但最吸引人的是有十九名妇女参加的“薅地”比赛。
    在一块杂草较多、禾苗密集的谷子地里，二十分钟的比赛开始了。十九名女将力争上游，她们聚精会神地深弯着腰前进。高小毕业生、十八岁的姑娘从云书，已汗流浃背，但无论如何也撵不上五十七岁的于淑清老大娘。于老大娘两只手拔草间苗飞快，时间到了，她把所有的对手都撇在后边了。
    经过评定，大家一致认为：于淑清老大娘薅的地又多、又快、又好，因此她获得了这次薅地比赛的冠军。
