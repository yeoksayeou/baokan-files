Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 20th: Today, nearly ten thousand literary and art workers in Shenyang took to the streets, using various artistic forms to angrily condemn the crimes of Anglo-American imperialism in invading Lebanon and Jordan.

In each of the literary and artistic teams, there was a costumed contingent. They vividly portrayed the righteous image of the people of the Middle East and the ugly faces of the Anglo-American war criminals.

People enjoying their holidays stood on the streets, watching the parade of literary and artistic teams, warmly expressing their support for the people of the Middle East. A child in his mother's arms looked at a group of costumed "war criminals" and innocently said, "American devils, bad guys!" A group of older children chased after "Eisenhower," cursing as they went.

These literary and art workers were divided into dozens of street performance teams, staging live dramas, choruses, clapper talks, and puppet shows in various districts of the city. The literary and art propaganda team of the Northeast Conservatory of Music taught new songs on the streets. The programs performed by each team were newly created by theater and music workers.

    沈阳文艺工作者走向街道扩大宣传
    新华社沈阳20日电  今天，沈阳市近万名文艺工作者走到街头，用各种文艺形式愤怒地谴责美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩、约旦的罪行。
    在各个文艺队伍中，都有一支化装队伍。它们形象地表现了中东人民的正义形象和美英战争犯子们的丑态。
    欢度假日的人们，伫立在街头，观看着游行的文艺队伍，热情地表示他们对中东各国人民的支持。一个在母亲怀抱里的孩子，看着一群化装的“战争犯子”，就天真地说：“美国鬼子，坏蛋！”一群较大的孩子追着“艾森豪威尔”边走边骂。
    这些文艺工作者分成几十个街头演出队，在市内各个区分别演出了活报剧、合唱、快板和木偶戏。东北音乐专科学校的文艺宣传队在街头教新歌。各队演出的节目，都是戏剧、音乐工作者新近创作的。
