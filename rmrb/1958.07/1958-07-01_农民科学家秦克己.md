In the Technical Revolution, Creating Miracles

    Peasant Scientist Qin Keji
    Fang Jiawen
    Peasants are entirely capable of becoming scientists. If anyone doesn't believe it, just look at the deeds of Qin Keji!
    
    Becoming a Student of Michurin
    Qin Keji is a twenty-seven-year-old Communist Youth League member from the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Guanmenkou Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province. He currently serves as the technical director of the cooperative's youth experimental farm. He started conducting experiments in 1954. At that time, the area was still organized into mutual aid teams, and farmers' farming techniques were very backward. Wheat yields were only seventy or eighty jin per mu, and corn only yielded one hundred twenty or thirty jin. Qin Keji thought that to change this backward state of production, new technologies had to be adopted. But I've only had one year of junior high school, can I do it? Once, he read a book called "The Story of Michurin," and was greatly inspired. He thought, Michurin didn't go to university either, and he made such a great contribution. It shows that as long as you are willing to learn and work hard, everyone can become an expert. So he decided to learn from Michurin and actively study new technologies.
    When he first promoted new technologies to farmers, no one believed him. He conducted three comparative experiments on his own two mu of wheat fields: deep plowing, improved varieties, and fertilization. The results showed that under the same conditions, deep plowing to seven inches yielded 407 jin per mu, plowing to five inches yielded 362 jin per mu, and plowing to three inches yielded 291 jin per mu; the Bima No. 1 wheat variety yielded 439 jin per mu, which was 142 jin more than the local Xiaobaimai wheat; fertilized fields yielded 325 jin per mu, while fields fertilized with local fertilizer yielded 297 jin per mu. The facts educated everyone, and the following year, 73% of the village's wheat fields adopted new technical measures, achieving a large-scale bumper harvest.
  
  Firm Confidence, Tenacious Labor
    In 1955, the advanced cooperative was established, and Qin Keji suggested to the cooperative committee that they create several mu of experimental fields to study intercropping and relay cropping to improve land utilization. This was never the local custom, and cooperative members were afraid he would ruin the land. Qin Keji said, "Everything is thought up by people, and everything is done by people. What hasn't happened in the past can happen now!" Seeing his determination, the cooperative committee allocated him two mu of abandoned farmyard land that had been idle for more than three years. As the saying goes, "It's better to farm a road for ten years than a farmyard for one." But Qin Keji was not discouraged. He said, "Even if you give me two mu of barren mountains, I will still conduct experiments." He turned the barren farmyard into fertile fields through tenacious labor, humbly learning from the experience of a labor model in Hebei Province who achieved four crops in three seasons. He also ran to Liangshan County, more than a hundred li away, to consult an experienced old farmer. Then, he conducted an experiment on one mu to achieve five crops in four seasons in the experimental field. As a result, the yield reached more than 4,000 jin.
    This time, everyone was convinced. The following year (1956), more than 3,000 mu of spring land in the whole cooperative implemented intercropping and relay cropping. At this time, the cooperative allocated ten mu of experimental fields and seventy mu of high-yield fields, three heads of livestock, a set of farm tools, and one hundred yuan to him to establish the youth experimental farm. This year, the experimental farm's experimental fields have expanded to seventy mu, and the high-yield fields have expanded to one hundred and seventy mu.
    
    The Experimental Farm Becomes a General Staff Department
    Over the past few years, the youth experimental farm has become the cooperative's technical general staff department, and Qin Keji has become the cooperative's technical advisor. Every new technology promoted by the cooperative is first tested in the experimental fields before being推广推广推广推广 promoted. The average annual yield of the experimental fields and high-yield fields is nearly twice as high as the yield of ordinary production teams. Last year, the highest wheat yield in the experimental field reached 1,195 jin per mu. The cooperative's annual technical operating procedures are all formulated and controlled by the youth experimental farm. Over the past few years, the youth experimental farm has cultivated nine improved varieties of corn, wheat, and soybeans, totaling more than 16,000 jin, just in the area of promoting improved varieties. In addition, the experimental farm has also cultivated more than 180 new varieties such as multi-ear, multi-row corn, medicinal corn, Tibetan safflower, and Soviet mung beans. Over the past few years, almost all the cooperative's cadres in the county have come to visit their experimental farm. Qin Keji has been praised and rewarded by the Party, government, and Youth League organizations for his outstanding achievements in production.
      
      Failure is Experience
    Qin Keji has full confidence in each of his experiments, forging ahead with perseverance. Two years ago, he experimented with vernalized wheat, but the wheat seedlings didn't even grow a node. Someone advised him not to try again. He said, "Don't be afraid, if one experiment fails, try a second time. Each failure brings experience." Last year, he conducted a second experiment, and after forty days of hard work, he found the correct method for seed vernalization treatment, and the experiment was successful. As a result, the yield of one mu of vernalized wheat was forty jin higher than the general yield of local winter wheat.
    Qin Keji thinks boldly and acts boldly. Last year, he made two amazing attempts: one was to sow wheat in the summer and harvest it in the autumn, and the other was to grow wheat that could be harvested once and then grow a second crop. In the autumn, both types of wheat grew nodes and ears, but they did not produce grains. He plans to continue experimenting in the future, first finding out why they don't produce grains, and then further studying how to make them produce grains. He is full of confidence in this experiment. He thinks, "Wheat can be grown in places with year-round heat and no severe winter, so we should be able to grow wheat in the summer."
    Qin Keji's experimental activities are multifaceted. He has also made many contributions to the reform of tools. This year, he created seven new types of agricultural implements, including windmills, hand-cranked water pumps, fertilizer applicators, artificial rainmakers, and fog collectors. Recently, he also created the "Wanbao Reservoir," which can store well water and develop diverse economies.
    
    Daring to Think, Daring to Act, Studying Hard
    Qin Keji's bold experiments are based on diligent study and solid learning. He attaches great importance to theoretical study. He owns 1,600 agricultural technology and theory books, including in-depth studies of biology, Michurin, and Lysenko's theories. He has read the least of these books once, and the most has been read six times. He also subscribes to six newspapers and periodicals. He not only learns from books diligently, but also pays close attention to learning from advanced experiences in other places. Over the past three years, he has visited agricultural cooperatives and scientific departments in more than twenty counties and cities, including Jining, Tai'an, Ziyang, Linqing, Yanggu, Shenxian, Fanxian, Liangshan, Liaocheng, and Jinan, to learn advanced experiences and collect improved varieties. Last autumn, he heard that the corn in Liu Kuizhai Cooperative in his county was growing well, so he immediately ran there, walked around the cornfield three times, looked from the edge of the field to the inside, from the inside to the outside, observed carefully with a magnifying glass, and then studied hard after returning, and determined to make the corn in the high-yield fields reach 3,300 jin per mu this year, and also created two mu of double-ten-thousand-jin corn experimental fields. Some cooperative members made up a jingle for him: "Keji has a superstitious disease, he doesn't care about his life when it comes to technology, when he hears that production is good somewhere, he runs there day and night."
    Due to Qin Keji's enthusiastic activities, their youth experimental farm now maintains regular contact with more than twenty agricultural science research departments across the country, fifty-six agricultural schools, institutions, twenty-seven agricultural cooperatives, more than forty experimental farms, and more than a thousand individuals. Over the past few years, Qin Keji has also used the fruits of his labor to set up a research room with quite rich content. The research room has various instruments, books, charts, as well as 175 kinds of seed specimens, 76 kinds of crop specimens, and more than 200 kinds of insect pest specimens. Qin Keji has become a native agricultural expert through tireless learning.

专栏：在技术革命中创造奇迹

    农民科学家秦克己
    方家文
    农民完全可能成为科学家。谁要是不相信的话，就请看看秦克己的事迹吧！
    作米丘林的学生
    秦克己是山东省寿张县关门口乡和平农业社的一个二十七岁的青年共产党员，现在担任这个社的青年试验场技术主任。他从1954年开始搞试验。那时当地还是互助组，农民的耕作技术很落后，小麦亩产只有七、八十斤，玉米只产一百二、三十斤。秦克己想，要改变这种生产落后状况，必须采用新技术。可是我只上过一年初中，能行吗？有一次，他看了一本“米丘林的故事”，受到很大启发。他想，米丘林也没有念过大学呀，他做出那样大的贡献。可见只要肯学肯干，人人都能变内行。于是他下定决心学习米丘林，积极钻研新技术。
    当他初次向农民宣传推广新技术时，谁也不相信他的话。他就在自家的二亩麦田里做了深耕、良种、施肥等三种对比试验。结果在同等的条件下，深耕七寸亩产四百零七斤，耕五寸亩产三百六十二斤，耕三寸亩产二百九十一斤；碧玛一号小麦良种亩产四百三十九斤，比本地小白麦多产一百四十二斤；施化肥的亩产三百二十五斤，施土肥的亩产二百九十七斤。事实教育了大家，第二年全村73％的麦田采取了新的技术措施，获得了大面积的丰收。
  坚定的信心顽强的劳动
    1955年成立了高级社，秦克己建议社委会搞几亩试验田，研究间种套作，提高土地的利用率。当地从来没有这个习惯，社干社员也怕他糟蹋土地。秦克己说：“什么都是人想出来的，什么都是人干出来的，过去没有过的事现在也能办！”社委会见他这样坚决，就拨给他二亩荒了三年多的场园地。常言道：“能种十年路，不种一年场。”但秦克己并没有灰心，他说：“就是给我二亩荒山也要搞试验。”他以顽强的劳动把荒场变成良田，虚心地学习了河北省一位劳动模范四作三收的经验；又跑到百里以外的梁山县，请教一位有经验的老农，然后在试验田上搞了一亩五种四收的试验。结果产量达到四千多斤。
    这一来大家可信服了，第二年（1956年）全社就有三千多亩春地实行了间种套作。这时，社里拨出了十亩试验田和七十亩丰产田，三头牲口，一套农具，还有一百元钱，交给他办青年试验场。今年，试验场的试验田扩大到七十亩，丰产田扩大到一百七十亩。
    试验场成了参谋部
    几年来，青年试验场成了合作社技术参谋部，秦克己也成了合作社的技术顾问。社里推行的每项新技术，都先在试验田里试验，以后再推广。试验田和丰产田每年的平均产量，都比一般生产队的产量高出近两倍。去年试验田的小麦亩产量最高达到了一千一百九十五斤。全社每年的技术操作规程，都是由青年试验场制订和掌握。几年来，青年试验场仅推广优良品种一项，就培育了玉米、小麦、大豆等优良品种九种，共计一万六千多斤。此外，试验场还培植了多穗、多行玉米，药玉米、西藏红花、苏联绿豆等一百八十多种新品种。几年来，全县合作社的干部差不多都来参观访问过他们的试验场。秦克己由于在生产上创造出卓越的成绩，曾受到党、政府和团组织的多次表扬和嘉奖。
      失败就是经验
    秦克己对自己的每一项试验都有十足的信心，勇往直前，百折不挠。他前年试验春化小麦，麦苗连节都没拔。有人劝他不要再试了。他说：“不怕，一次失败再试第二次，失败一次就得一次经验。”去年又进行了第二次的试验，经过四十天的苦钻，找到了种子春化处理的正确办法，试验成功了。结果一亩春化小麦比当地冬小麦的一般产量高四十斤。
    秦克己想的大胆，干的也大胆。去年他做了两种惊人的尝试，一种是夏播秋收小麦，一种是能割了一茬再长第二茬的小麦。到秋天，这两种小麦都拔了节，抽了穗，只是没结粒。他打算今后继续试验，先找出它为什么不结粒的原因，再进一步研究怎样使它结粒。他对这个试验充满了信心，他想：“在终年炎热没有严冬的地方能种小麦，我们夏天也就能种小麦。”
    秦克己的试验活动是多方面的。他在革新工具中也做出了不少贡献。今年他创造了风力水车、手摇抽水机、追肥器、人工降雨器和降雾器等七种新式农具。最近他还创造了能储藏井水和发展多种经济的“万宝水库”。
    敢想敢干苦学苦钻
    秦克己的大胆试验，是建立在刻苦钻研和扎扎实实学习的基础上的。他非常重视理论学习，他自己拥有农业技术、理论书籍达一千六百多册，其中包括较深的生物学、米丘林、李森科的学说等。这些书最少的他读过一遍，多的已读过六遍。他自己还订了六份报纸和刊物。他不但认真向书本学习，还非常注意学习外地的先进经验。三年来，他到过济宁、泰安、滋阳、临清、阳谷、莘县、范县、梁山、聊城、济南等二十多个县市的农业社和科学部门，学习先进经验，采集优良品种。去年秋天他听说本县刘魁斋社的玉米长得好，就马上跑到那里，绕着那片玉米地转了三圈，从地边看到里，从里看到外，用放大镜详细观察，回来后又认真钻研，并决心在今年使丰产田的玉米达到亩产三千三百斤，另外还搞了二亩双万斤的玉米试验田。有的社员给他编了一段顺口溜：“克己有个迷信病，提起技术不要命，听说哪里生产好，白天黑夜往哪跑”。
    由于秦克己的热心活动，现在他们的青年试验场，与全国各地二十多个农业科学研究部门、五十六个农业学校、机关、二十七个农业社、四十多个试验场和一千多个人保持着经常的联系。几年来，秦克己还用自己劳动的结晶，设置了一个内容相当丰富的研究室。研究室里有各种仪器、书籍、图表，还有一百七十五样种子标本、七十六样作物标本、二百多种害虫标本。秦克己就这样孜孜不倦的学习，成了土生土长的农业专家。
