　　Middle East News Agency Report

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th. The Middle East News Agency reported in its first dispatch from Baghdad on the 15th that the Iraqi troops stationed outside Baghdad, originally intended by the Said regime to be sent to Jordan and Lebanon, participated in the revolution that began at three o'clock in the morning of July 14th.

　　The Middle East News Agency reported on the course of the Iraqi revolution, stating that the leaders of the revolution had attempted to peacefully take over the Royal Palace, but Crown Prince Ira ordered the guards to open fire, resulting in many deaths. Later, Ira was killed in the conflict.

　　After the news of the storming of the Royal Palace was announced, angry crowds of citizens poured into the palace. People removed the bodies of the dead, but the crowd left Ira's body behind, shouting for revenge.

　　Said's official residence was surrounded and searched, and secret rooms were discovered inside. Unable to open the doors of the secret rooms, the entire house was later blown up. However, Said was not found inside. Nuri al-Said was captured and killed the next day.

　　In the morning, after the news of the revolution's victory was announced, the masses flocked to the area where the British Embassy was located and smashed the statue of the British General Wood, who had invaded Iraq during the First World War. A large crowd surrounded the British Embassy, shouting "Down with Imperialism."

　　A staff member of the British Embassy opened fire on the crowd, killing three people. At this time, the staff of the British Embassy were burning secret documents inside. Because they were very flustered and burned many documents, the furniture caught fire as a result. The Iraqi Army immediately helped put out the fire. Afterwards, the British Embassy staff and their families moved to the Baghdad Hotel.

　　The news said that all units in the Iraqi Army and all mass organizations in Iraq have now announced their support for the revolution.

    巴格达革命的火焰
    中东通讯社报道伊拉克政变经过
    新华社开罗16日电　中东通讯社15日在它从巴格达发出的第一条消息中说，驻在巴格达市外的、赛义德政权原来打算派往约旦和黎巴嫩的伊拉克军队，参加了在7月14日清晨三点开始的革命。
    中东通讯社报道伊拉克革命的经过说，革命的领导人们曾经试图和平地接管王宫，但是王储伊拉却下令卫兵开火，结果打死了很多人。后来伊拉在冲突中被击毙了。
    在攻进王宫的消息宣布以后，愤怒的市民群众拥进了王宫。人们把死人的尸体搬走了，但是群众把伊拉的尸体留了下来，高呼要报仇。
    赛义德的官邸曾经受到包围和搜索，在里面发现有密室，由于无法打开密室的门，后来把整个房子都炸毁了。但是，在里面没有发现赛义德。努里·赛义德在第二天被抓住和杀死了。
    在早上，革命胜利的消息公布以后，群众拥往英国大使馆所在的地区，打毁了在第一次世界大战期间侵犯伊拉克的英国将军伍德的雕像。大批群众包围了英国大使馆，高呼“打倒帝国主义”。
    英国大使馆的一个工作人员向群众开枪，并且打死了三个人。就在这个时候，英国大使馆的工作人员就在里面烧毁秘密文件。由于他们很慌张，烧的文件又很多，结果把家具烧着了。伊拉克陆军立即帮助灭火。其后，英国大使馆的工作人员和家属搬到了巴格达旅馆。
    消息说，现在伊拉克陆军中所有团队以及伊拉克所有群众团体都已经宣布支持革命。
