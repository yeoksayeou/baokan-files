Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 9th: The Ministry of Agriculture convened a national on-site meeting on horse breeding and improvement in Zhenlai and Nong'an Counties, Jilin Province, and decided to vigorously launch a horse breeding campaign of "All Mated, All Pregnant, All Born, All Alive," and to establish commune-run artificial insemination stations on a large scale in rural areas, so as to double the number of horses in China during the Second Five-Year Plan period, with improved hybrid horses and domestic fine horse breeds accounting for one-third.

The representatives attending the meeting studied and researched the experience of Zhenlai County in developing horse artificial insemination stations relying on agricultural cooperatives, and the experience of Nong'an County in rapidly developing horse breeding. The meeting believed that the reason why these two counties have achieved great success is mainly due to the Party committee's emphasis, the full utilization of the method of "boldly mobilizing the masses, experimenting with everything," carefully selecting talent, improving technology, and ensuring the work of the breeding stations from the organizational and institutional aspects. In the discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that the experience of these two counties completely shattered the mysterious views on artificial insemination technology and breeding fine horse breeds, thereby also overthrowing the outdated view that the speed of horse breeding and improvement cannot leap forward. The meeting believed that rapidly breeding and improving horses is of great significance to socialist construction. In the early stage of agricultural mechanization in our country, the need for horses will not decrease but increase greatly; even after our country's agriculture is fully mechanized, the role of horses will still be very important. In accordance with this spirit, the representatives attending the meeting revised the indicators for horse breeding and improvement in various places. The meeting emphasized that in addition to continuing to focus on breeding work this year, all localities should make various preparations for the great development of the horse breeding industry next year.

This on-site meeting was held from June 28th to July 7th.

    大力繁殖良种马
    镇赉县社办人工授精站经验将普遍推广
    据新华社长春9日电  农业部在吉林省镇赉和农安两县召开全国马匹繁殖改良现场会议，决定大力开展“全配、全准、全产、全活”的马匹增殖运动，在农村中大搞社办人工授精站，做到在第二个五年计划期间我国马匹数量增加一倍，改良杂种马和本国良种马匹占到三分之一。
    参加会议的代表们学习和研究了镇赉县依靠农业社发展马匹人工授精站的经验，和农安县高速度发展养马业的经验。会议认为，这两个县取得巨大成绩的原因，主要是党委重视，充分运用了“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的方法，认真挑选人材，提高技术，并从组织上和制度上保证了配种站的工作等。在讨论中，代表们一致认为，这两个县的经验彻底粉碎了对人工授精技术和繁殖良种马匹的神秘观点，从而也推翻了马匹繁殖改良速度不能跃进的陈旧观点。会议认为，高速度地繁殖和改良马匹对社会主义建设具有重大的意义。在我国农业机械化的初期，对马匹需要不是减少而是大量增加；即使我国农业全盘机械化以后，马匹的作用仍很重要。根据这一精神，到会代表纷纷修订了各地马匹繁殖改良的指标。会议强调指出：今年各地除继续抓紧配种工作外，应该为明年养马事业大发展做好各项准备工作。
    这次现场会议从6月28日召开到7月7日结束。
