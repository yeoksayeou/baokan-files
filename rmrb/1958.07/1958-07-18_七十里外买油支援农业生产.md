    Buying Oil Seventy Li Away to Support Agricultural Production
    At noon on June 25th, the weather was very hot. Zheng Weixin, the business section chief of the Songmen Supply and Marketing Cooperative, had just returned from Tonghua, forty li away, where he had been purchasing goods. As soon as he entered the door, he happened to meet people sent by the township's thousand-person drought resistance planting army to buy boiler oil at the store. The supply and marketing cooperative had never sold this kind of oil before, but the people needed it urgently because if they couldn't buy the oil, the boiler would not be able to operate the next day, and they would not be able to plant. At this time, Comrade Zheng Weixin thought: Now is the tense period of drought resistance and corn planting, and we commercial workers must buy boiler oil today to support drought resistance and planting and serve agricultural production. Therefore, he was not afraid of the scorching sun, and rode his bicycle seventy li in one breath to Sangyuan to buy fifty-eight jin of boiler oil, and rushed back to Songmen Township overnight, delivering the oil to Sun Wencheng Agricultural Cooperative, seven or eight li away, at more than eleven o'clock in the middle of the night.
    Comrade Zheng Weixin's spirit of wholeheartedly serving agriculture moved the surrounding comrades.

    七十里外买油支援农业生产
    6月25日的中午，天气非常热，宋门供销合作社业务股长郑维新刚从四十里外的童华采购货物回来。一进门，刚巧碰到乡里组织的千人抗旱点种大军派人到门市部来买锅驼机油，供销社从来没有卖过这种油，可是来人要得很急，因为买不到油明天锅驼机就开不动，也就不能点种。这时，郑维新同志想：现在正是抗旱点种玉米的紧张时期，我们做商业工作的一定要在今天把锅驼机油买来，支援抗旱点种，为农业生产服务。于是，他不怕烈日，骑着车子一口气跑了七十里路，到桑元买了五十八斤锅驼机油，连夜赶回宋门乡，在半夜十一点多钟把油送到七、八里路外的孙温城农业社。
    郑维新同志这种热心为农业服务的精神，感动了周围的同志。
