Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - TASS reports: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower on July 2nd, suggesting that the Soviet Union and the United States take joint steps to prevent sudden attacks.

Khrushchev suggested that the Soviet and U.S. governments immediately appoint corresponding representatives (such as experts), including representatives from both military departments, to jointly study this issue and, within a predetermined period, formulate recommendations on measures to prevent the possibility of sudden attacks. The results of these talks could then be discussed at a summit meeting. Khrushchev also mentioned that if possible, other countries should also send representatives to participate in the talks.

In the letter, Khrushchev said that given the current tense nature of international relations, and the increasing speed of armament, especially the unabated production of increasingly destructive weapons of mass destruction, we believe that while taking preliminary measures to limit the arms race, such as a universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing, it is necessary to reach an agreement on measures to prevent the possibility of one country suddenly attacking another.

Khrushchev said that the issue of preventing sudden attacks is particularly acute, given the recent dangerous flights of U.S. military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs over many Western European countries and from the Arctic region towards the Soviet border.

Khrushchev also pointed out that the Soviet government had previously made suggestions to the United States regarding specific measures to prevent the possibility of sudden attacks. The Soviet Union suggested reaching an agreement on the establishment of observation posts at railway hubs, major ports, and highway trunk lines, in conjunction with certain disarmament measures, as well as on aerial photography of areas of importance for preventing the danger of sudden attacks. We are willing to reach an agreement on reciprocal aerial photography within a zone extending eight hundred kilometers east and west of the main forces' concentration areas of the two European blocs. The Soviet government also suggested designating an aerial inspection zone including a portion of Soviet Far East territory and a corresponding portion of U.S. territory, in addition to this zone in Europe.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet proposals were put forward on the basis of equally considering the security interests of all parties. They also take into account the proposals previously put forward by Western countries, especially the U.S. government.

Khrushchev said that although the U.S. government agreed on the need to study the issue of eliminating the danger of sudden attacks at a high-level meeting, it is regrettable that the U.S. government has not yet treated these Soviet proposals with a positive attitude. The proposals made by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet government on this issue on May 28 this year do not demonstrate their desire to work together to seek an agreement on methods of preventing sudden attacks.

Khrushchev believes that the Soviet and U.S. governments should demonstrate practical initiative on this issue. He believes that as long as all parties proceed from the point that the security interests of every country participating in the agreement must be considered, and do not take actions that would exacerbate the situation and increase the risk of war, it is entirely possible to reach an agreement on this issue.

Khrushchev's letter was delivered to the U.S. State Department on the 2nd through the Soviet Embassy in the United States.

### 赫鲁晓夫写信给艾森豪威尔  建议进行协商防止突然进攻

    赫鲁晓夫写信给艾森豪威尔
    建议进行协商防止突然进攻
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫7月2日写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，建议苏联和美国在防止突然进攻方面采取共同步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫建议，苏联和美国政府在最近指派包括双方军事部门代表在内的相应的代表（譬如专家级的代表），在一起共同研究这个问题，并且在某一个事先确定的期间内，就防止突然进攻的可能性的措施问题制订出建议。这个会谈的结果可以在政府首脑会议上加以讨论。赫鲁晓夫还提到，如果可能的话，其他国家也派一些代表参加这个会谈。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中说，鉴于当前国际关系的紧张性质，以及各国武装的速度、特别是破坏性越来越大的大规模毁灭性武器的生产有增无减的情况，我们认为，在采取限制军备竞赛的初步措施如普遍停止核武器试验的同时，有必要就采取防止一国突然进攻另一国的可能性的措施问题达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，鉴于最近以来，载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机在许多西欧国家的上空以及从北极地区向苏联边境进行危险的飞行，防止突然进攻的问题就显得特别尖锐了。
    赫鲁晓夫还指出，苏联政府曾经就防止突然进攻的可能性的具体措施向美国提出过建议。苏联建议就在铁路枢纽、大港口和公路干线上设立监督岗并配合裁军方面的某些措施的问题，以及就对预防突然进攻的危险性具有重要意义的地区进行空中摄影的问题达成协议。我们愿意在欧洲的两个国家集团的主要武装部队集中地区分界线以东和以西各八百公里的范围内相互进行空中摄影一事达成协议。苏联政府还建议除了欧洲的这个地区以外，规定一个包括苏联远东一部分领土和相应的一部分美国领土的空中视察区。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的建议是在同等考虑各方安全的利益的基础上提出的。其中也考虑到西方国家、特别是美国政府以前所提出的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国政府虽然同意在高级会议上有必要研究消除突然进攻的危险的问题，但遗憾的是，迄今为止，美国政府方面还没有用积极的态度来对待苏联的这些建议。美、英、法三国政府今年5月28日就这个问题向苏联政府提出的建议，不能证明它们希望共同努力在防止突然进攻的方法上寻求协议。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，苏美两国政府应当在这个问题上表现出实际的主动性。他认为，只要各方都从必须考虑参加协议的每一个国家的安全利益这一点出发，不采取使局势尖锐化和增加发生战争的危险的行动，那么在这个问题上是完全有可能达成协议的。
    赫鲁晓夫的信已在2日经由苏联驻美国大使馆交给美国国务院。
