Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th – To curb the rising floodwaters of the Han River and ensure a bumper harvest on both banks, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Sluice Gate in the lower reaches of the Han River was opened today for flood diversion, with the approval of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hubei Provincial People's Committee. At 4:10 PM, all thirty steel plate gates of the 412-meter-long structure were raised by five decimeters. After the gate was opened, the raging floodwaters flowed through the wide diversion channel into the storage area at a rate of over 1,300 cubic meters per second, then slowly discharged into the Yangtze River. Several hours after the gate was opened, the floodwaters began to stabilize, and the water level in the Yuekou and Xiantao areas had slightly decreased.

Since the beginning of July, continuous rainfall in the upper reaches of the Han River has caused the largest flood since 1935. The flood peak has currently entered the area of Nianpanshan below Yicheng from Xiangyang. It is expected to reach Yuekou on the evening of the 10th. Opening the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Sluice Gate will alleviate the threat of the flood peak.

    制止汉水洪水涨势
    杜家台分洪闸启闸分洪
    新华社武汉8日电  为制止汉水洪水涨势，保证汉水两岸农业丰收，经中共湖北省委员会、湖北省人民委员会批准后，汉水下游的杜家台分洪闸今天启闸分洪。这座长四百一十二公尺、三十孔的钢板闸门在下午四点十分全部提升了五公寸。启闸后，汹涌的洪水以每秒一千三百多公方的流量通过宽阔的分洪道流入蓄洪区，然后徐徐泻入长江。启闸后数小时，洪水涨势开始平稳，岳口、仙桃一带水位已略下降。
    7月初以来，汉水上游连日降雨，汉水出现了1935年以来的最大洪水。目前洪峰已由襄阳进入宜城以下碾盘山一带。10日晚可达岳口。杜家台分洪闸开闸后便可减轻洪峰的威胁。
