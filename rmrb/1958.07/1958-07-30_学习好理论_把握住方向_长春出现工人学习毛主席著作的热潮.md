Study Theory Well, Grasp the Direction
Changchun Appears a Surge of Workers Studying Chairman Mao's Works

(Our report) Changchun City workers have been actively establishing study groups for Chairman Mao's works, determined to arm themselves with Chairman Mao's writings.

With the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and the rapid development of socialist construction, more and more workers are eagerly demanding to study Chairman Mao's works. Wang Guozhu, a young worker from the "Red Flag" magazine study group in the Engine Workshop of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said: "Last year, in the anti-Rightist struggle, we workers completely refuted the Rightists with facts, but we knew little in theory, and our criticism of them lacked strength. Therefore, we were urgently asking to study theory at that time." Many workers in the rice flour workshop of the Grain Processing Factory felt that the situation was developing very quickly now, and their thinking could not keep up, so they must strengthen their political theory study. Worker Li Qingshan said: "I have been a worker for more than twenty years, and I am okay in the workshop production, but I always feel that something is missing. After the rectification, I understand that it is a lack of political theory. In the future, I must study Chairman Mao's works and grasp the direction."

Under these circumstances, workers in many factories have automatically established study groups for Chairman Mao's works. The Xinhua Printing Factory established a workers' spare-time philosophy class with 75 employees participating. After seeing news in the newspaper about workers in Shanghai studying theory, workers at the Postal and Telecommunications Equipment Factory, led by veteran workers Pei Wangzhen, Yang Wu, and Wu Changyou, established a theory study group of seven people on the same day; subsequently, young workers also established two study groups. More than 60 workers at the Changchun Printing Factory participated in theory study. Thirty-one workers in the rice flour workshop of the Grain Processing Factory participated in theory study.

The workers' demand to study theory has received support from the factory leadership. The Party and government leaders of the Xinhua Printing Factory, the Grain Processing Factory, and the responsible comrades of the Erdaohuzi District Committee of the Communist Party of China will personally give lectures to the workers. The Party Committee of the Xinhua Printing Factory has also selected a batch of books on philosophy, established a library and reading room, and established a core group to specifically tutor the philosophy class.

These study groups have now formulated study plans, determined the content, time, and methods of study. The Xinhua Printing Factory's workers' spare-time philosophy class has determined that the main content of study will be Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and the Party's policies and resolutions. The automobile workers' theory study group has determined that the focus is currently on studying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. Many groups have emphasized in their plans that when studying theory, they should link it with the problems in their own factory, workshop, work section, and their own production, work, and thinking for research and discussion. The electricians' group of the Grain Processing Factory is currently preparing to study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in order to solve the problems existing in the unity of the two electricians' groups.

### 学习好理论　把握住方向  长春出现工人学习毛主席著作的热潮

    学习好理论　把握住方向
    长春出现工人学习毛主席著作的热潮
    本报讯　长春市工人纷纷成立学习毛主席著作小组，决心用毛主席的著作武装自己。
    随着整风和反右派斗争的胜利和社会主义建设的飞速发展，越来越多的工人迫切要求学习毛主席著作。长春第一汽车制造厂发动机车间“红旗”杂志学习小组青年工人王国柱说：“去年在反右派斗争中，我们工人用事实完全驳倒了右派，但在理论上我们知道的少，对他们的批判还缺乏力量，因此，我们当时就迫切地要求学习理论。”粮谷加工厂米粉车间的许多工人都感到现在形势发展很快，思想跟不上，必须加强政治理论学习。工人李青山说：“我当了二十多年工人，在车间生产还行，但总觉得缺点啥。整风以后，明白了，是缺政治理论。今后一定要学习毛主席著作，把握住方向。”
    在这种情况下，许多工厂的工人自动成立了学习毛主席著作小组。新华印刷厂成立了一个有七十五名职工参加的工人业余哲学班。邮电器材厂工人在报上看到上海工人学理论的消息后，当天就由老工人裴王震、杨武、吴常有等七人成立了一个理论学习小组；随后，青年工人也成立了两个学习小组。长春印刷厂有六十多名工人参加了理论学习。粮谷加工厂米粉车间有三十一名工人参加了理论学习。
    工人学习理论的要求得到了各厂领导上的支持。新华印刷厂、粮谷加工厂党政领导和中共二道河子区委负责同志都将亲自给工人讲课。新华印刷厂党委还选择了一批有关哲学的书籍，建立了一个图书阅览室，并且成立了一个核心小组，专门辅导哲学班学习。
    这些学习小组现在已经制定了学习规划，确定了学习内容、时间和方法。新华印刷厂工人业余哲学班确定以毛主席的“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和党的政策、决议为主要学习内容。汽车工人理论学习小组确定目前以学习党的“八大”二次会议文件为中心。许多小组都在规划中强调学习理论时要联系本厂、本车间、本工部和自己的生产、工作、思想上的问题，进行研究讨论。粮谷加工厂电工组最近就准备学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，以便解决两个电工组在团结上存在的问题。
