The communique on this year's summer agricultural harvest in our country has been published. In this communique, we first see the following figures: The total output of summer grain is 101 billion jin, exceeding last year's total output of summer grain by 41.3 billion jin, an increase of 69%. Among them, the total output of winter wheat, the main summer crop, is 68.9 billion jin, exceeding last year's total output by 27.9 billion jin, an increase of 68%. These are several extraordinary figures. What do they indicate? They indicate that the development speed of agriculture in our country has entered a new stage, namely, the stage of transition from gradual progress to a great leap forward. This is a great contribution of all our country's farmers to the cause of socialist construction. All pessimistic arguments that agricultural output can only increase by a few percentage points and not by dozens of percentage points have been completely bankrupt.

The iron-like facts before the people declare to the world: Our country's wheat output has surpassed the United States and ranks second in the world. The speed of wheat production increase in our country is unprecedented in history, both in ancient and modern times, and is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. Here, let us compare with the United States, which calls itself the "wheat kingdom." In 1949, the total wheat output of our country was only 44% of the total wheat output of the United States. Only a few years have passed, and we have not only caught up with it, but have greatly surpassed it. It can be said with certainty that we will always surpass it in the future. Everyone may remember the "White Paper on Sino-American Relations" published by the U.S. State Department less than two months before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949? In the preface to the "White Paper," U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said that China has too large a population, and solving the people's food problem is an "overwhelming pressure." The implication is that the Chinese Communist Party cannot solve its own economic problems after it seizes power and can only live on American flour. Now, the facts of the economic development of the People's Republic of China led by the Chinese Communist Party tell them that we have not eaten a single star of American flour, but our lives are particularly good, and they will get better and better in the future.

Why has our country's wheat output increased so dramatically? Is it because last year's harvest was very bad and the base number was too low? Facts have proved that this is not the case. In 1957, the total national output of winter wheat was 41 billion jin, and the yield per unit area was 112.8 jin; in 1956, there was a bumper harvest of winter wheat, with a total output of 43.148 billion jin and a unit yield of 118.3 jin. Compared with the two years, 1957 was lower than the bumper harvest of 1956, but if compared with an equal planting area, the total output was only about 2 billion jin lower, and the yield per unit area was only more than 5 jin lower. This year, the winter wheat planting area has been reduced by more than 8 million mu compared with 1957, but the total output has increased by 27.9 billion jin, and the yield per unit area has increased by 80.2 jin, an increase of 71%. So, is it because this year has been particularly favorable weather and "God" has taken special care? It is not. This year's winter wheat, from sowing to harvesting, suffered no fewer natural disasters than in previous years. The main wheat-producing areas have suffered droughts of varying degrees. Anhui had no rain for 70 days, Henan and Shanxi had no rain for 100 days, and Hebei suffered the worst drought in nearly 30 years, with no thorough rain for more than 200 days. In addition to drought, provinces suffered from frost, wind, hail, and pests and diseases during the wheat growing season. The area affected by pests was also more widespread than last year. In Henan Province, during the wheat flowering and grain filling season, one-third of the province, namely 24 million mu of wheat fields, suffered from wheat sucking insects, and 4 million mu suffered from yellow rust. In Anhui Province, in addition to controlling wheat rust, 7.78 million people were mobilized every day, accounting for more than 50% of the province's rural semi-labor force. It can be seen that it is neither because the base number is too low nor because of favorable weather. So, what is the reason? There is only one answer: The astonishing growth rate of wheat is the result of implementing the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better , more economical results." This general line has made the unparalleled and enormous power of the 500 million farmers in our country erupt like a volcano, shaking the earth and overturning rivers and seas. This general line has made the 500 million farmers in our country recognize their own strength more clearly than ever before. They dare to overthrow the history of agriculture and dare to compete with nature. As a result, they have won, they have won an unprecedented bumper harvest, and they have opened up a new historical period for agriculture in our country.

We know that people are the most decisive factor in the productive forces. Among all things in the world, people are the most valuable. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created. The unprecedented miracles of expanding the irrigated area by 350 million mu, accumulating 300 billion dan of fertilizer, and the large-scale agricultural tool reform movement in the winter and spring were all created by people and made successful by people. This created favorable conditions for the bumper harvest of summer crops. The farmers have given full play to their high degree of subjective initiative, created miracles, and shattered the absurd theories of those who have always believed that agriculture can only develop gradually and slowly. Those "theorists" stubbornly stick to the old tune of "without water conservancy, without chemical fertilizers, and without machinery, agricultural output cannot increase significantly," and they are always frowning and sighing, saying: It is impossible for agriculture in our country to increase production by leaps and bounds. They have forgotten the most important point: machines, chemical fertilizers, and water conservancy are all manufactured and built by people. If the various miracles created by the high tide of production and construction since last winter and this spring have not awakened these people, then the first batch of rich fruits that have already been obtained should be able to awaken them!

Natural disasters have always been a major enemy of agricultural production in our country. Therefore, many people are superstitious about "God" and always pin their hopes on "God," saying "Man proposes, God disposes," and "A thousand calculations are not as good as 'God's' calculation." The facts of this year's bumper summer harvest prove that no matter how clever "God" is, he still cannot outsmart our more than 600 million people, "Success depends on man" and not on heaven. As mentioned earlier, this year's disasters were no fewer than in previous years, and we encountered severe drought during the wheat planting season. In previous years, the wheat harvest would have been affected. However, this year is different. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the people's rectification movement, politics took command in production, and the people had the best way to educate themselves and improve themselves - the great blooming, contending, and debating. Wherever there was drought, a great debate was launched to see whether heaven would defeat man or man would defeat heaven, and the struggle against drought was immediately launched. As a result, drought not only failed to become an obstacle to sowing, but instead became the driving force for building water conservancy and permanently overcoming water and drought disasters. Henan and Hebei provinces built water conservancy projects earlier and in greater numbers, which is the result of the struggle against drought. The doubling of wheat production in Henan should also be attributed to the victory of the struggle against drought. Bo'ai County in Henan Province suffered five disasters in a row, including wind, frost, drought, flood, and insects. However, their heroic slogan of "Crossing the Yellow River, crossing the Yangtze River, a ten-year plan, completed in one year" was precisely put forward in the struggle against disasters. Under the encouragement of this slogan, they launched a great debate every time they encountered a disaster, and five disasters launched five large-scale struggles. Finally, in the summer harvest season alone, the county's wheat yield per mu reached 520 jin, crossing the Yellow River, of which one-third, a full 100,000 mu, reached 800 jin per mu, crossing the Yangtze River. The ten-year plan was completed in just one season instead of one year. Some people may be surprised to see such a situation in Bo'ai County. In fact, what is so strange about this? According to the dialectical point of view, good things and bad things can be transformed into each other. The problem depends on what attitude people take. When people give full play to their subjective initiative, do not be superstitious, do not rely on heaven, and actively struggle with heaven, bad things can also become good things, and average years can also become bumper years. If people just shake their heads and sigh there, and let "God" dictate, good things may not necessarily get good results, and bumper years will also become lean years.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly warned us that we must adapt our thinking to the changed situation. This year's bumper summer harvest shows that the development of agriculture in our country is undergoing tremendous changes. Many old ideas and old views need to be thoroughly changed in order to make our work adapt to today's situation. For example, in the past, many people believed that places with poor conditions and low yields could not increase production significantly. There are also many people who believe that places with good conditions and high yields cannot increase production significantly, because the yield is already very high and cannot be increased any further. Now, these views have been shattered by the facts. Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province is a well-known low-yield area in the province. Last year's summer harvest saw a surge in production from 500-600 million jin in normal years to 1.43 billion jin. This year, it has more than doubled, reaching over 3 billion jin. The average yield per unit area in the prefecture has also jumped from 154 jin last year to over 300 jin. Yanshi County in Henan Province is a high-yield county for wheat, and its wheat yield has been increasing year by year. In 1956, it reached a single yield of 262.4 jin. In 1957, it also produced 228 jin due to disasters. This year, many people in the county believed that it would be impossible to have a large increase in wheat production on such a high yield basis. They did not expect that the average yield of the county reached more than 570 jin. How much grain can be harvested from one mu of land? How much potential is there for increasing agricultural production in our country? It seems that no one dares to make a conclusion now. Indeed, we should no longer use a frame, like a tight band, to bind our minds. Still taking wheat as an example, the current national average yield per mu is still less than 200 jin, but the highest yield has reached more than 7,000 jin. It can be seen that the potential for increasing production is far from being exhausted. Wheat is like this, and so are other crops. Some people like to quote classics, saying that what did not exist in history cannot exist today, and what does not exist in foreign countries cannot exist in China. The miracle of high-yield wheat tells them that what did not exist in history does exist today, and what does not exist in foreign countries does exist in China. We are now fully confident that we can say that how much grain our country wants to increase production can be decided by our people according to their own needs. We are no longer the intellectual slaves of history and foreign countries. We are already the masters who can control our own destiny.

The great victory of the summer production leap forward has further strengthened our confidence in striving for a great leap forward in autumn production this year. Since wheat, which has always been considered a "low-yield crop," can leap forward at a rate of 71%, why can't high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes increase production even more significantly? Why can't cotton production leap forward? We must advance victoriously and without slackening. The U.S. imperialists say that our large population is an "overwhelming pressure." We will use more facts to tell them that with a large population, we produce even more grain. As long as we need it, we can produce as much grain as we want.

### 今年夏季大丰收说明了什么？

专栏：社论

    今年夏季大丰收说明了什么？
    我国今年夏季农业收成的公报发表了。在这个公报里，我们首先看到这样几个数目字：夏收粮食总产量一千零一十亿斤，超过去年夏收粮食总产量四百一十三亿斤，增长了69％。其中夏收主要作物冬小麦总产量六百八十九亿斤，超过去年的总产量二百七十九亿斤，增长了68％。这是几个不平常的数目字。它们说明了什么呢？它们说明，我国农业的发展速度，已经进入了一个新的阶段，即由渐进到跃进的阶段。这是我国全体农民对社会主义建设事业的伟大贡献。一切认为农业产量只能按百分之几的速度而不能按百分之几十的速度增长的悲观论调已经完全破产了。
    摆在人们面前的铁一般的事实向世界宣告：我国小麦产量超过美国跃居世界第二位了。我国小麦增产速度是古今中外历史上所没有的，更是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。这里，我们就来同自称为“小麦王国”的美国比一比。1949年，我国小麦总产量只有美国小麦总产量的44％，时间仅仅过了几年，我们不仅赶上了它，而且大大地超过了它。可以肯定地说，以后将会永远超过它。大家可还记得，1949年中华人民共和国成立前不到两个月，美国国务院发表的“中美关系白皮书”吗？在“白皮书”的序言上面，美国国务卿艾奇逊说，中国人口太多，解决人民的吃饭问题是一种
  “不堪重负的压力”。言外之意，就是说中国共产党掌握了政权，解决不了自己的经济问题，只有靠美国的面粉才能过日子。现在，中国共产党领导的中华人民共和国经济发展的事实告诉他们，我们没有吃过美国的一星星面粉，日子却特别过得好，今后还会越过越好。
    我国的小麦产量，为什么会有这样惊人的增长呢？是去年收成很坏，基数太低了吗？事实证明并非如此。1957年，全国冬小麦总产量四百一十亿斤，单位面积产量一百一十二点八斤；1956年冬小麦大丰收，总产量四百三十一点四八亿斤，单位产量一百一十八点三斤。两年相比，1957年比大丰收的1956年是低一些，但如以相等的播种面积相比，总产量也只低二十亿斤左右，单产只低五斤多。而今年，冬小麦播种面积比1957年缩小八百多万亩，总产量却增加了二百七十九亿斤，单产则增加了八十点二斤，提高了71％。那么，是不是今年特别风调雨顺，“老天爷”特别照顾呢？也不是。今年的冬小麦从播种到收获，自然灾害并不比往年少。主要产麦区都遭受到程度不同的干旱。安徽七十天无雨，河南、山西百日无雨，河北更遭到近三十年所未有的大旱，二百多天没有透雨。除了干旱，小麦生长期间各省都分别遭受到霜冻、风、雹和病虫等灾害。虫害面积也比去年普遍。河南省在小麦扬花灌浆时节，全省三分之一即二千四百万亩麦田发生了吸浆虫，四百万亩发生黄锈病。安徽省除治小麦锈病，每天出动了七百七十八万人，占全省农村整半劳力的50％以上。由此可见，既不是基数太低，也不是风调雨顺。那末，原因究竟是什么呢？答案只有一个：小麦的惊人增长速度，是贯彻执行党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的结果。这个总路线使我国五亿农民的无比巨大的力量像火山一样地爆发出来，震天动地，翻江倒海。这个总路线使我国五亿农民从来没有这样清楚地认识了自己的力量，他们敢于推翻农业的历史，敢于与天公较量高低。结果，他们胜利了，他们夺得了空前大丰收，开辟了我国农业新的历史时期。
    我们知道，人是生产力中最有决定性的因素。世间一切事物中，人是最宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么奇迹也可以创造出来。一个冬春扩大灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，积肥三千亿担，大规模的农具改革运动等等旷古未有的奇迹，都是人造出来的，都是人作成功的。这就给夏收作物大丰产创造了良好条件。农民们发挥了高度的主观能动性，创造了奇迹，打破了历来认为农业只能够逐步慢慢发展的农业渐进论者们的荒谬理论。那些“理论家”死守住“缺水利、没化肥、没机器，农业产量就不可能大量增加”的一套老调，念念不忘，一直愁眉苦脸、唉声叹气地说：我国农业不可能跃进式地增产。他们忘记了最重要的一点，机器、化肥、水利都是人制造和建设出来的。去冬今春以来的生产建设高潮所创造的种种奇迹，如果还没有使这些人觉悟过来的话，现在已经拿到手的第一批丰产的硕果，总该能够使他们觉悟过来了吧！
    自然灾害一直是我国农业生产的大敌。因此，许多人迷信“老天爷”，总是把自己的命运寄托在“老天爷”身上，说什么“作事在人，成事在天”，“千算万算，不如‘老天爷’一算”。今年夏季大丰收的事实证明，“老天爷”再高明，也还是算不过我们六亿多人民，“成事在人”而不在天。前面说过，今年灾害并不比往年少，播种小麦时期就遇到严重干旱。要是在往年的话，麦收是会要受到损失的。可是，今年就不同了，经过了反右派斗争和全民整风运动，政治在生产上挂了帅，人民群众有了教育自己提高自己的最好方式——大鸣大放大辩论。哪里干旱就在哪里展开大辩论，看是天战胜人，还是人战胜天，就马上展开抗旱斗争。结果，干旱不但没有能够成为播种的障碍，反而变成了大兴水利永远战胜水旱灾害的动力。河南、河北两省水利修得又早又多，正是抗旱斗争的成果。河南小麦得到成倍的增产，也要归功于抗旱斗争的胜利。河南省博爱县小麦连续遭到风、霜、旱、涝、虫等五次灾害，可是，他们的“跨黄河，越长江，十年规划，一年完成”的英雄口号，恰恰是在和灾害斗争中提出来的。在这个口号的鼓舞之下，每遇一次灾害他们就展开一次大辩论，五次灾害掀起五次大规模的斗争。终于只夏收一个季节，这个县小麦亩产量就达到了五百二十斤，跨过了黄河，其中三分之一整十万亩的亩产量达到八百斤，越过了长江。十年规划不需一年只需一季就完成了。某些人看了博爱县这样的情况不免大为惊奇，其实，这有什么奇怪呢？按照辩证法的观点，好事和坏事本是可以互相转化的。问题决定于人采取什么态度。当人们充分发挥了主观能动性，不迷信，不靠天，积极起来与天斗争的时候，坏事也可以变成好事，平年也可以变成丰年。如果人们只在那里摇头叹气，听凭“老天爷”摆布，好事也不一定能得好的结果，丰年也会变成歉年。
    毛泽东同志一再告诫我们说，要使自己的思想适应变化了的情况。今年夏季大丰收表明，我国的农业发展情况正在发生巨大的变化。许多旧思想旧看法都需要加以彻底改变，才能使我们的工作适应今天的情况。比如，过去曾有不少的人，认为条件坏，产量低的地方不能大量增产。又有不少的人，认为条件好产量高的地方也不能大量增产，理由是产量已经很高了，上不去了。现在，这些看法都被事实打破了。湖北省襄阳专区，就是全省有名的低产区，去年夏季大丰收，产量由一般年景的五、六亿斤激增至十四亿三千万斤，今年更翻了一番，达到三十亿斤以上。全区平均单位面积产量也由去年的一百五十四斤跃增到三百斤以上。河南省偃师县是小麦高产县，小麦产量逐年增加，1956年达到单产二百六十二点四斤，1957年因灾也产二百二十八斤。今年，这个县曾有不少人认为小麦在这样高的产量基础上，再要有大的增产是不可能的，没有想到全县平均产量竟达到了五百七十多斤。究竟一亩地能打多少粮食？我国的农业增产潜力有多大？看来现在谁也不敢下断语了。的确，我们不应该再用一个框子，像紧箍咒似的把自己的头脑束缚起来了。仍然以小麦来说吧，当前全国平均亩产量还不到二百斤，可是最高产量已达到七千多斤。可见，增产潜力是远没有到顶。麦子如此，其他作物也是如此。有些人喜欢引经据典，说历史上没有的，今天就不可能有，外国没有的，中国也不可能有。小麦高额丰产的奇迹告诉他们，历史上没有的，今天的确有了，外国没有的，中国的确有了。我们现在已经完全有把握可以说，我国粮食要增产多少，是能够由我国人民按照自己的需要来决定了。我们不再做历史和外国的思想奴隶了，我们已经是能够掌握自己的命运的主人了。
    夏季生产大跃进的伟大胜利，进一步增强了我们争取今年秋季生产大跃进的信心。既然一向被认为“低产作物”的小麦都能以71％的速度跃进，那么高产作物的水稻、玉米，甘薯为什么不能更加大量地增产呢？棉花的产量为什么不能跃进呢？我们要乘胜猛进，毫不懈怠。美帝国主义者说我们人口多是“不堪重负的压力”，我们要用更多的事实告诉他们，人口多，生产粮食更多。只要我们需要，要生产多少就可以生产多少粮食出来。
