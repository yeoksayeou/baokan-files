Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: According to a report from the Indian Press Trust reporter in Adana, Turkey, in recent days since the American invading troops landed in Lebanon, the United States has assembled its 19th Composite Air Force Strike Force at the Adana base in Turkey. This American base is near the Turkish-Syrian border.

The report said that this force is equipped with nuclear weapons, the pilots have been trained in the use of nuclear weapons, and are currently on a 24-hour "combat readiness" status. Approximately 1.25 million pounds of war materials have been shipped to the Adana base for use by the American invading troops. It is reported that during the transfer, four aircraft from this force were destroyed because they were unable to obtain fuel from aerial tankers and were hit by hurricanes.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Beirut Dispatch: On July 26th, American invading troops sent out a large number of jet fighters to fly over the Lebanese capital Beirut and other cities to "demonstrate" and carry out shameless intimidation against the Lebanese people.

On the evening of July 26th, insurgents in the Lebanese capital engaged in the most intense fighting of the week with Chamoun's security forces. The two sides exchanged fire in the Parliament Square area in the city center, using mortars and machine guns. The battle lasted about two hours. It is reported that several cars were destroyed, and there were casualties. At the same time, in the Zaydaniyah district of the city, Chamoun's security forces attempted to seize a strategically important hill controlled by the insurgents, who resolutely repelled them. Gun battles also occurred in other areas of the city.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: Cyprus Dispatch: Four hundred British Royal Marines arrived at the port of Limassol, Cyprus, on July 26th.

This force landed at Tobruk, Libya, not long ago. Sources revealed that this force was transferred from Tobruk to Cyprus to strengthen British military power in the region. The last batch of troops from the British 19th Infantry Brigade was also airlifted from Britain to Cyprus on the same day.

    据新华社27日讯　据印度报业托辣斯记者从土耳其的亚达那报道，自从美国侵略军在黎巴嫩登陆以后的最近几天中，美国已经把它的第十九混合空军进攻部队集结到土耳其的亚达那基地。这个美国基地在土耳其和叙利亚边境附近。
    消息说，这支部队配备有核武器，飞机驾驶员都受过使用核武器的训练，并且在目前已经处在二十四小时的“作战戒备”状态。运到亚达那基地供美国侵略军使用的战争物资已经有大约一百二十五万磅。据报道，在调动途中，这支部队的四架飞机因为无法从空中加油机取得燃料和受飓风的袭击而毁掉了。
    据新华社27日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国侵略军在26日又派出一大批喷气式战斗机在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特和其他城市上空飞行“示威”，向黎巴嫩人民进行无耻的恫吓。
    黎巴嫩首都的起义者26日晚上同夏蒙的保安队发生了一周来最激烈的战斗。双方在市中心的议会广场地区互相射击，双方使用了迫击炮和机关枪，战斗持续了约两小时。据报道，有几辆汽车被击毁，还有一些人伤亡。同时在市内的泽达纳亚区，夏蒙保安队企图侵占起义者控制的一座具有战略意义的小山，起义者坚决地回击了他们。在市内的其它一些地区也发生了枪战。
    新华社27日讯　塞浦路斯消息：英国海军陆战队四百人26日到达塞浦路斯的利马索耳港。
    这支部队是不久以前在利比亚的土布鲁克登陆的。消息透露，这支部队从土布鲁克调到塞浦路斯是为了加强英国在这一地区的军事力量。英国第十九步兵旅的最后一批部队，也在同一天从英国空运到塞浦路斯。
