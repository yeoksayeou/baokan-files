Comrades:
    We women of Beijing, along with the people of the entire city, are gathered here to support the heroic actions of the Lebanese people in resisting aggression and to cheer the establishment of the Iraqi revolutionary government. We oppose the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism against Lebanon and protest the interference of U.S. and British imperialism in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries. We believe that in every corner of the world, mothers and sisters who love peace and oppose colonialism, along with people all over the world, are also issuing the same strong calls as we are.

    The Chinese people, and Chinese women, have long suffered from the cruel oppression of imperialism and its agents. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people and Chinese women have repeatedly and bravely struck at the imperialists until they were driven out of China. Therefore, we have always hated and despised the imperialists. We have always held deep concern and sympathy for the struggle for national independence against imperialism. This time, the U.S. imperialists have brazenly torn off their masks, revealing their jackal nature, and launched an armed invasion of Lebanon, attempting to suppress the national independence movements of the entire Arab world. This shameful act of aggression in no way indicates the strength of U.S. imperialism, but rather further illustrates that, in the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, and under the fiery anti-colonialist tide of the Arab people, the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism in West Asia has reached the point of disintegration.

    Here, we warn the U.S. imperialists: Haven't you been beaten enough in China and Korea? Haven't you lost enough face? If you stubbornly refuse to learn your lesson, an even more disgraceful end awaits you.

    Here, we extend our highest respect to the people of Lebanon who have risen up in revolt, and our warmest congratulations to the Iraqi revolutionary government. Your struggle for national independence and freedom will surely be victorious. The Chinese people, the socialist countries, and the peace-loving people of the world stand firmly with you.

    We must shout:
    Celebrate the great victory of the Iraqi national independence movement!
    Long live the victory of the national independence movements in Asian and African countries!
    Oppose U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the Arab people!
    U.S. troops get out of Lebanon!

    中国妇女和你们站在一起
    妇女代表、优秀投递员罗淑珍的讲话同志们：
    我们北京的妇女，和全市人民在这里集会，支持黎巴嫩人民反抗侵略的英雄行动，欢呼伊拉克革命政府的成立。反对美帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩，抗议美英帝国主义对中东各国人民的干涉。我们相信在全世界每一个角落里，爱好和平反对殖民主义的母亲们、姐妹们，和全世界人民也都在发出和我们同样的强烈的呼声。
    中国的人民，中国的妇女，曾经长期遭受帝国主义和他们的代理人的残酷压迫。中国人民和中国妇女，在中国共产党的领导下，屡次英勇地打击了帝国主义者，直到把他们赶出中国去。因此，我们对帝国主义者从来是仇视的，从来是蔑视的。对于反帝国主义的民族独立的斗争，从来是抱着深切的关心和同情的。美帝国主义者这次悍然撕下假面具，露出豺狼本相，武装侵略黎巴嫩，而且妄图镇压整个阿拉伯各国的民族独立运动。这种可耻的侵略行为，丝毫也不能表示美帝国主义的强大，而正是进一步说明了：在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，在阿拉伯人民如火如荼的反殖民主义的浪潮下，美帝国主义者在亚洲西部的殖民统治的宝座，已经到了土崩瓦解的地步了。
    我们在这里警告美帝国主义者：在中国、在朝鲜，你们挨打还没有挨够吗？你们的脸还没有丢尽吗？如果你们硬是不接受教训，更可耻的下场还在等待着你们。
    在这里，我们向黎巴嫩起义的人民致以崇高的敬意，向伊拉克革命政府致以热烈的祝贺。你们争取民族独立自由的斗争，必然取得胜利，中国的人民、社会主义各国和全世界爱好和平的人民，坚决和你们站在一起。
    我们要高呼：
    庆祝伊拉克民族独立运动的伟大胜利！
    亚非各国民族独立运动的胜利万岁！
    反对美国干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政！
    美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去！
