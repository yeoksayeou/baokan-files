The Longtan Cooperative in Beipiao County, Liaoning Province, is one of the best in the county for sports activities. They created many rhymes to promote sports. For example, when they first promoted the Labor and Defense System, the masses didn't understand it. Later, they used the farmers' language to create the following rhyme, which everyone understood immediately:

    The Labor and Defense System is clear,
    Each item has its targets here,
    Running, jumping, throwing, all in line,
    Meeting targets is truly fine.
    Badge on the chest so bright,
    Certificate secured just right.
    Healthy bodies, strength so grand,
    Building the motherland, helping hand.

The cooperative set sports work targets. After the masses discussed them, their enthusiasm was very high. Their slogan was:

    Morning exercise, noon exercise,
    No leisure under the moon's skies,
    Pass the Labor and Defense System soon,
    Strong bodies, model production boon.

They also exercised during breaks from building reservoirs. The masses said:

    A full basket, two hundred and fifty pounds,
    Carrying the load, like tigers we bound,
    Work is done, play basketball,
    Strength increases, five hundred and fifty after all.

Several female athletes surpassed the men in their work. While building the reservoir, they completed 3.5 cubic meters of earthwork in half a day. Several male members of the Sanjiazi Production Team only completed 1.5 cubic meters in a whole day. The masses created a rhyme:

    Sanjiazi men,
    Earn only four and a half points then,
    The athletes, not so simple,
    Earn nine and a half, a shining example,
    One woman is worth two men in might,
    Making the men feel shame and blight.

    歌唱体育大跃进的顺口溜
    龙潭社是辽宁北票县体育活动最好的一个社，他们在开展体育活动中编了许多顺口溜。如开始宣传劳卫制时，群众听不懂，后来用农民的话编了下面的顺口溜，大家一听就懂：
    劳卫制好明了，
    各个项目有指标，
    跑跳投掷样样有，
    达到指标就叫好。
    证章胸前挂，
    证书装在腰。
    身体练好劲头大，
    建设祖国立功劳。
    该社订出了体育工作的指标，群众讨论后劲头很大，他们提出的口号是：
    早晨练，午间练，
    月亮底下不休闲，
    早日通过劳卫制，
    身体强健生产当模范。
    在修水库的休息时间也锻炼，群众说：
    满筐土二百五，
    挑起担子赛猛虎，
    干完活计玩篮球，
    力量又增五百五。
    有几名女运动员干活超过男子，她们修水库时，半天作三点五土方，三家子生产队几名男社员，一天才作一点五土方。群众编了顺口溜：
    三家男子汉，
    一天才赚四分半，
    运动员不简单，
    半天就赚九分半，
    一个女的顶了两个男子汉，
    真让男儿惭。
