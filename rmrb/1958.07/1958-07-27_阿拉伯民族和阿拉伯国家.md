The Arab Nation and Arab Countries

The Arab Nation

The Arab nation is the self-designated term for various ethnic groups of Semitic language family residing in West Asia and North Africa. The earliest distribution area of the Arab tribes was approximately in the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. From the second millennium BC, Arabs began to spread throughout the entire Arabian Peninsula. From the seventh century AD, a large portion of Arabs migrated to the countries they expanded into—Syria, Mesopotamia, southern Iran, Egypt, and North Africa. Due to the mutual influence of Arabs and local residents, a series of Arab tribes were formed, some of which developed into nations. They speak different dialects of the same Arabic language: Arabic dialect, Syrian dialect, Iraqi dialect, Egyptian dialect.

The basic racial type of Arabs belongs to the Mediterranean race; however, in Iraq and East Arabia, the primary racial type is Armenian; in South Arabia, the primary racial type is Ethiopian.

In terms of religious belief, most Arabs are Sunni Muslims, while some areas are Shiite Muslims (Yemen, East Arabia, Iraq, southern Iran) and Wahhabi Muslims (Saudi Arabia). In Lebanon and Palestine, most Arabs are Christians.

The Arab people have long been subjected to colonial oppression by imperialism. They launched national independence movements and successively gained independence and freedom. They have great differences in the level of social development. In the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Lebanon, Algeria, and other relatively developed Arab countries, modern industry and commerce and cities have developed. However, in the Arabian Peninsula, it is still largely in the medieval stage of development. Some other regions even retain remnants of the primitive communal system.

Arab Countries

Arab countries include Lebanon, the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen in Asia, the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco in Africa. In addition, it includes various small emirates in the Arabian Peninsula, such as Bahrain, Oman, Trucial Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Aden, etc.

The origin of Arab countries can be traced back to Muhammad. In 571 AD, Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was born in the city of Mecca on the Arabian Peninsula. At the age of forty, he founded Islam. At that time, an army led by Muhammad occupied the entire Arabian Peninsula.

In the seventh century AD, the Arab nation continued to expand outwards, gradually occupying all the lands currently known as Arab countries, as well as other vast areas of Eurasia and Africa. Later, its power gradually diminished, retreating to the lands belonging to the Arab countries. By the ninth century AD, it had split into many large and small feudal states. Many of these countries preserved the same language, culture, religion, customs, and economic conditions; in the vast land from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, most people in Arab countries spoke the same Arabic language and believed in the same Islam.

    阿拉伯民族和阿拉伯国家
    阿拉伯民族
    阿拉伯民族，是居住于西亚和北非的闪米特语系各族的自称。阿拉伯部落最早分布的地区，大约是在阿拉伯半岛的东北部。公元前二千年，阿拉伯人开始分布于整个阿拉伯半岛。公元七世纪起，一大部分阿拉伯人迁居到他们所扩展的一些国家——叙利亚、美索不达米亚、伊朗南部、埃及和北非地区。由于阿拉伯人与当地居民的相互影响而形成了一系列的阿拉伯部族，其中有些发展成民族。他们所讲的是同属阿拉伯语的不同方言：阿拉伯方言、叙利亚方言、伊拉克方言、埃及方言。
    阿拉伯人的基本人种类型，是属于地中海种族；但是在伊拉克和东阿拉伯，主要则是阿尔明尼亚人种类型；在南阿拉伯，主要则是埃塞俄比亚人种类型。
    在宗教信仰上，大部分阿拉伯人是逊尼派伊斯兰教徒，有些地方是十叶派教徒（也门、东阿拉伯、伊拉克、南伊朗）和清净派教徒（沙特阿拉伯），在黎巴嫩和巴勒斯坦，大部分阿拉伯人则是基督教徒。
    阿拉伯人民长期受到帝国主义的殖民压迫。他们展开了民族独立运动，纷纷取得了独立和自由。他们在社会发展水平上，有很大的不同。在阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、阿尔及利亚和其他比较发达的阿拉伯国家，已发展着现代工商业和城市。但在阿拉伯半岛上则在很大程度上还处于中世纪的发展阶段。其他一些地区甚至还保存着原始公社制的残余。
      阿拉伯国家
    阿拉伯国家包括亚洲的黎巴嫩、阿联叙利亚地区、伊拉克、约旦、沙特阿拉伯、也门、非洲的阿联埃及地区、苏丹、利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥。此外，还包括阿拉伯半岛的各小酋长国，如巴林群岛、阿曼、特鲁西亚阿曼、卡塔尔、科威特、亚丁等。
    阿拉伯国家的起源要从穆罕默德说起。公元571年，伊斯兰教主穆罕默德生于阿拉伯半岛的麦加城。四十岁时创立了伊斯兰教。当时，穆罕默德领导的一支军队占领了整个阿拉伯半岛。
    公元七世纪时，阿拉伯民族继续向外扩展，逐渐占据了现称阿拉伯国家的所有土地以及欧亚非的其他广大地区。后来势力逐步缩小，退居到阿拉伯国家所属的土地上。到公元九世纪时，它分裂成许多大大小小的封建国家。其中许多国家都保存了同一的语言、文化、宗教、风俗习惯和经济条件；从大西洋到印度洋的广大土地上，阿拉伯国家中大多数人说着同一的阿拉伯语，信奉着同一的伊斯兰教。
