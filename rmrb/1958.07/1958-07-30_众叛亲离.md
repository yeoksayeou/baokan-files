Universally Disliked and Isolated
Dong Fengya
The July 28th issue of the American magazine "Time" had an article discussing the American war of aggression, entitled "Reactions Around the World." The "reactions around the world" listed in this article were: "recollection," "doubt," "fear," "unease," "heartache," and "condemnation." In reality, it paints a quick sketch of the moribund American imperialism as universally disliked and isolated.

"All formerly occupied countries recall the past." The "past" of the "formerly occupied countries" is naturally the imperialist "occupation" of these countries. Therefore, "recalling the past" naturally means regarding the "landing of American troops in Lebanon" as, at the very least, an "occupation" of Lebanon. To put it simply, "a large portion of the world's population" sees this as aggression. Countries and nations that were once invaded and then occupied, and have now won their independence, know how to deal with aggression. This is the essence of "recollection." The dream of these countries becoming American allies has been completely shattered.

"Even those Latin American, Asian, and African countries that usually stand on the side of the West have doubts." This refers to the ruling cliques in the American imperialist vassal states. Even they have "doubts" and are murmuring criticisms. As for the people of these countries, they are far from merely having doubts. Haven't we already seen people in Latin American countries and even in Britain itself rising up to hold protest demonstrations?

The so-called "fear" occurs in those countries that fear that a major war triggered by this will first strike their own heads. Indeed, if a major war breaks out, some countries will inevitably suffer before the United States.

"Unease comes from those who believe that the United States is supporting the wrong forces in the Middle East in the wrong way." However, within the aggressive bloc itself, there are also people who feel this way. This unease is justified. To put it mildly, the United States is indeed supporting the "wrong forces in the Middle East" in the "wrong way." But what makes them uneasy is that if this error is not corrected immediately, the consequences will be too severe. Because in today's situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, insisting on carrying out aggression to the end will inevitably lead to one's own demise.

"Time" magazine felt that "some of these reactions are heartbreaking." What reflections made "Time" magazine "heartbroken"? The example it cited was: Canada's "Globe and Mail" pointed out that this was aggression, and the British Labour Party called it "shameful." The Adenauer government was also forced to "reproach" this, and France also engaged in a bit of sabotage. Even in Britain, which followed the United States in sending troops to invade the Middle East this time, someone "joked" and said, "At least the United States has now discovered that it is just as drunk as we are in falling into a ditch." This has a hint of schadenfreude. However, seriously speaking, this is really not a "joke," but a very serious and "heartbreaking" remark. The Americans have not only fallen into a ditch, but they have fallen much deeper than the British, and they have fallen much harder. For Britain, since the Suez Canal incident, its aggressive face has long been exposed to the world, becoming a universally recognized robber. While the United States, this robber, is far more ferocious and vicious than Britain, because it is cunning, it has always tried every means to conceal its face. It even played a trick of crying "stop thief" in the Suez incident, leaving a bit of a charming face in the minds of some people. This time, however, it is carrying out daylight robbery nakedly, and it is a real thief caught red-handed. The victory that the people of the world have thus obtained over the American robber is far greater than ever before.

"Time" magazine's position is not consistent with ours, but it finally could not but be forced to reflect these "reactions around the world," indicating how isolated the American imperialism has become in its universally disliked and isolated situation. But its reflection is too incomplete, because it ignores the most important force in the world today: the powerful existence of the socialist camp, which is the greatest guarantee of peace and the mortal enemy of world aggressors. Wherever aggressors go, they will inevitably run into this hard nail. There is also the high tide of the Arab people's national independence revolution and their resolute counterattack against aggressors. What has been omitted by "Time" magazine is precisely the most important thing. And these forces are standing tall and firm. No matter how much one wants to "not acknowledge" them, it is futile.

    众叛亲离
    董逢亚
    7月28日的美国“时代”周刊，有一篇谈论美国侵略战争的文章，题目叫作“世界各地的反应”。这篇文章所列举的“世界各地的反应”是：“回忆”、“怀疑”、“恐惧”、“不安”、“痛心”和“谴责”。实际上是为日暮途穷的美帝国主义画了一幅众叛亲离的速写。
    “所有曾经被占领的国家回忆起往事”。“曾经被占领的国家”的“往事”，自然是帝国主义对这些国家的“占领”。那末“回忆往事”自然就是把“美军在黎巴嫩登陆”至少看作是对黎巴嫩的“占领”。简单些说就是“占世界人口很大一部分”的人把这看作是侵略。过去曾被侵略而后又被占领现在已经争得独立的国家和民族，是懂得怎样来对付侵略的。这就是所谓“回忆”的实质。打算要这些国家成为美国同盟军的梦想，是彻底破灭了。
    “甚至通常站在西方这边的那些拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲国家也产生了怀疑”。这里是指的美帝国主义附庸国里的那些统治集团，连他们都有所“怀疑”而议论啧啧了；至于这些国家的人民，却远不只是怀疑，我们不是早就看到拉丁美洲国家甚至是英国本土的人民也起来作抗议的示威游行了吗？
    所谓“恐惧”，是发生在害怕因此引起的大战会首先打在自己头上的那些国家。的确大战不打则已，一打总有一些国家比美国要先遭殃的。
    “不安来自那些认为美国正在采取错误的方式支持中东错误的力量的国家”。但是，在侵略集团的内部，也包含有这种人。这不安是有道理的。轻描淡写地看来，美国的确正在用“错误的方式”支持着“中东的错误的力量”。但使他们不安的却是，如果不立即改正的话，这种错误的结果会太严重。因为要在今天东风压倒西风的形势下，一意孤行进行侵略到底，没有不遭致本身的破灭的。
    “时代”周刊感到“其中有些反应是感到痛心。”这令“时代”周刊“痛心”的反映是什么呢？它举的例就是：加拿大的“环球邮报”指明这是侵略，英国工党骂这为“可耻”。阿登纳的政府也曾被迫对这进行过“责备”，法国在一旁也有点拆台。甚至在这次跟随美国出兵侵略中东的英国，还有一个人“开玩笑”地说：“至少美国现在已经发觉同我们一样醉醺醺地掉在一个沟里了。”这很有些幸灾乐祸的样子。不过，认真的说，这实在并不是“开玩笑”，而是一句非常严肃而又“痛心”的话。美国人不仅是掉在了一个沟里，而且远比英国人掉的深的多，而且摔的也重的多。对于英国来说，自从苏伊士运河事件以后，侵略的面目，早已在全世界暴露无遗，成了举世公认的强盗。而美国这个强盗，虽然远比英国要凶狠毒辣的多，但由于它狡猾，过去总是在千方百计地掩盖着自己的面目，它甚至在苏伊士事件中要了一手贼喊捉贼的把戏，在一部分人中留有着一点迷人的面孔。这次却是赤裸裸地进行白天抢劫，而且又是真贼实犯，被当场拿获。世界人民因此对美国强盗所获得的胜利，是远比过去任何时候都要大的。
    “时代”周刊同我们的立场并不一致，但它终于不能不被迫反映出这“世界各地的反应”，说明着美帝国主义众叛亲离，已经到了何等孤立的境地。但它反映的又太不全面，因为他忽略了现今世界上最主要的力量：社会主义阵营的强大存在，是和平的最大保证，是世界侵略者的死敌，侵略者无论走到那里，总是不免要碰到这个硬钉子的。还有阿拉伯人民的民族独立革命热情的高涨，和对侵略者的坚决的反击。被“时代”周刊所遗漏的，也正是最主要的。而这些力量正巍然屹立，再怎么想“不承认”都是徒然的。
