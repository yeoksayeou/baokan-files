In the summer of two years ago, I visited Lebanon with the Chinese Youth Delegation. The Lebanese people's anti-imperialist, patriotic, steadfast, and unyielding will left me with extremely deep and unforgettable memories. Today, as the Lebanese people take up arms again to oppose American imperialist aggression, it makes me cherish even more the Lebanese people who demand national independence, and I am confident that they will achieve a glorious victory.

Lebanon is a country with beautiful scenery on the eastern side of the Mediterranean. Villas stand on the hillsides in the suburbs of Beirut. In the summer evenings, the sea breeze blows, and the weather is particularly cool. Europeans come here to escape the summer heat in an endless stream. In the high mountains of Baalbek, there is snow that never melts all year round, the mountains are about four thousand meters above sea level. You can go up by mountain climbing elevators. Each person has their own elevator, and they can cycle up and down. In the valley of Sitr, there are tall pine trees dozens of meters high. The Lebanese flag has a pine tree emblem, which is said to represent this beautiful scene. In the valley, streams murmur, the mountains are covered with dense forests, and the gardens are full of fruit.

Lebanon is not only beautiful in scenery and pleasant in climate, but also a country with an ancient culture. When we visited the Beirut Library, we were warmly received by the elderly librarian, who gave a detailed introduction to the library's long history and the hundreds of thousands of books preserved in the anti-imperialist struggle. When we said goodbye to the librarian, he presented two Arabic literary books to Peking University. We visited the Beirut Museum, where artifacts from 3000 BC, stone carvings from 1000 years ago, and modern handicrafts are on display. In various cities in Lebanon, you can see many cultural relics with Arab national characteristics everywhere.

Lebanon is also one of the Arab countries with a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. In the city of Tripoli, there are still bunkers left by the Lebanese people in their resistance against the Roman Empire's aggression. In the city of Tripoli, the large castle that resisted the Crusader invasion is still preserved. The fortifications of these bunkers are still intact, and there are also several iron cannons. The local people proudly say: We Lebanese, we Arabs, although we have suffered many invasions by imperialism, we have finally driven them all away. The Arabs have a glorious tradition of opposing Western imperialism, so we are not afraid of imperialism.

About ten kilometers north of Beirut, there is a place called Gouhe (溝河), with nineteen stone steles. These stone steles were all carved on the rocks in the mountains. From these stone steles, it can be seen that the peace-loving Lebanese people have been invaded by Turkey since the eleventh century, became a colony of the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century, and have also been attacked by the Roman Empire and the Crusaders, as well as enslaved by French and British imperialism. However, the heroic Lebanese people have persisted in a long, arduous, steadfast, and unyielding anti-imperialist struggle, and finally drove the invaders away. The imperialists landed here eighteen times, and were driven away by the Lebanese people eighteen times. Finally, in August 1946, the French intervention troops were finally driven away, and the nineteenth stone stele was carved. These stone steles are a symbol of the Lebanese people's struggle against imperialism. They record the shameful end of imperialism, and also record the final victory of the Lebanese people!

During our stay in Lebanon, we met with Muslim youth, university students, middle school students, and heads of the teachers and students union in Lebanon. They repeatedly stated: The Lebanese youth and people want to unite with the peace-loving people of the world to carry out the anti-imperialist struggle. If British and French imperialism dare to invade Arabia and attack Egypt (at that time, President Nasser had just announced the recovery of the Suez Canal), the Lebanese people will fight alongside all Arab people to defend independence and peace.

During our visit to Lebanon, many Lebanese youths secretly came to our hotel to see us, treating us as close friends, and expressing to us: they wish to be guests in China. They cheered for the great victory of the New China revolution and the amazing achievements of construction.

Currently, American imperialism is igniting the flames of aggression in Lebanon, and British intervention troops have also sent troops to Jordan. American and British imperialism wants to suppress the national liberation struggle of the Arab people, absorb the oil of the Southwest Asian countries, and rule the Southwest Asian countries. But what will be the result? American and British imperialists can go to Gouhe to see the nineteen stone steles, and they can visit the bunkers in Tripoli where the Arab people resisted imperialist aggression. We firmly believe that the Lebanese people, with their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will, with the full support of the people of the Middle East and the peace-loving people of the world, surely achieve final victory, and American and British imperialism will surely suffer a shameful defeat. The Lebanese people will erect the final stone stele in Gouhe.

    在黎巴嫩作客的日子里
    杜前
    两年前的夏天，我曾随中国青年代表团访问了黎巴嫩。黎巴嫩人民的反帝爱国坚强不屈的意志，给我留下极其深刻和难以忘怀的记忆。今天，黎巴嫩人民又拿起枪杆反对美帝侵略的时候，使我更加怀念要求民族独立的黎巴嫩人民，并确信他们一定会取得光荣的胜利。
    黎巴嫩是地中海东面一个风景优美的国家。在贝鲁特市郊的山坡上，屹立着一幢幢别墅。夏天的夜晚，海风吹拂，天气特别清凉。到这儿来避暑的欧洲人络绎不绝。在巴尔贝克的高山上，有终年不化的冰雪，山高约在拔海四千公尺以上。乘爬山电梯可以上去。爬山电梯每人一乘，可以循环上下。在西特尔的山谷里有几十公尺的高大松树，黎巴嫩的国旗上有着松树的标帜，据说就是代表这种优美的景象的。山谷里溪水潺潺，满山丛林密布，水果满园。
    黎巴嫩不但风景幽美，气候宜人，而且是一个有着古老文化的国家。我们参观贝鲁特的图书馆时，受到年长馆长的热情招待，他详细的介绍了图书馆悠久历史和在反帝斗争中保留下来的几十万册图书。在我们和馆长告别的时候，他把两部阿拉伯文的文学书籍赠送给北京大学。我们参观过贝鲁特博物馆，在博物馆里陈列着公元前三千年的石器，一千年前的石刻像，还有现代的手工艺品。在黎巴嫩的各个城市里，到处都可以看到许许多多的有着阿拉伯民族特点的文化古迹。
    黎巴嫩更是一个有着反帝斗争光荣传统的阿拉伯国家之一。在梯比里斯城，还留着黎巴嫩人民反抗罗马帝国侵略的碉堡。在的黎波里市还保留着反抗十字军侵略的大城堡。这些碉堡的作战工事还很完整，此外还有几尊铁炮。当地的人民骄傲地说：我们黎巴嫩人、阿拉伯人，虽然遭受过帝国主义多次的侵略，但最后都被我们赶走了。阿拉伯人有着反对西方帝国主义的光荣传统，所以我们不怕帝国主义。
    在贝鲁特北面约十公里有个名叫沟河的地方，有着十九块石碑。这些石碑都是在山上的岩石上凿成的。从这些石碑上可以看出，爱好和平的黎巴嫩人民，自十一世纪起就受土耳其的侵略，十六世纪变成奥斯曼帝国的殖民地，也受过罗马帝国和十字军的进攻，以及法英帝国主义的奴役。但是英勇的黎巴嫩人民一直坚持长期艰苦、坚强不屈的反帝斗争，终于把侵略者赶走了。帝国主义者在这里登陆十八次，也就被黎巴嫩人民赶走了十八次。最后在1946年8月法国干涉军终于被赶走了，凿了第十九块石碑。这些石碑就是黎巴嫩人民反对帝国主义斗争的标志。记载着帝国主义可耻的下场，也记载着黎巴嫩人民的最后胜利！
    我们在黎巴嫩逗留的日子里，曾经会见过黎巴嫩的穆斯林青年、大学生、中学生和师生联合会的负责人。他们再三地表示：黎巴嫩青年和人民要和全世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起，进行反帝的斗争。如果英法帝国主义胆敢侵略阿拉伯，进攻埃及（当时正值纳赛尔总统宣布收回苏伊士运河之后），黎巴嫩人民将和所有阿拉伯人民一起作战，保卫独立和和平。
    在我们访问黎巴嫩的日子里，许多黎巴嫩的青年，偷偷地到旅馆里来看我们，把我们当成知心的朋友，向我们表示：愿到中国作客。他们为新中国革命伟大胜利和建设的惊人成就而欢呼。
    目前美帝国主义正在黎巴嫩燃起侵略的战火，英国干涉军又出兵约旦。美英帝国主义就是想镇压阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争，吸取西南亚国家的石油，统治西南亚国家。但结果如何呢？美英帝国主义者可以到沟河上看看那十九块石碑，可以去参观一下梯比里斯阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义侵略的碉堡。我们坚信：有着反帝斗争光荣传统的黎巴嫩人民，在中东人民和全世界爱好和平人民的全力支持下，一定会取得最后的胜利，美英帝国主义一定会遭到可耻的失败。黎巴嫩人民要在沟河上树起最后一块石碑。
