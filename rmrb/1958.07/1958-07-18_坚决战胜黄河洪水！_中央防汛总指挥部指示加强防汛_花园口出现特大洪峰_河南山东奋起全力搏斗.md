Xinhua News Agency, July 17th—The Central Flood Control Headquarters, in order to strengthen flood prevention on the Yellow River and resolutely conquer the Yellow River flood, today issued instructions to the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, the Henan and Shandong Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, and the Flood Control Headquarters of each province. The full text of the instructions is as follows:

Since the beginning of the flood season, the Yellow River has successfully weathered two flood peaks, and significant victories have been achieved in flood prevention on other rivers as well. Currently, continuous heavy rains are occurring in the northern regions, and the Yellow River has experienced its largest flood peak since liberation. The dikes on both banks will undergo a severe test. We demand that the flood control headquarters at all levels along the Yellow River lead the people on both banks to make persistent efforts, resolutely conquer the Yellow River flood, and resolutely prevent the Yellow River from harming the people.

The flood season has only just begun, and this year's rainfall is characterized by alternating severe drought and torrential rains, with extremely uneven distribution. Therefore, all provinces are required to maintain a high degree of vigilance in flood control work. In areas where drought is severe, preparations must also be made for the sudden onset of torrential rains. It is essential to have measures and countermeasures in place for potentially extreme floods on all rivers. Complacency and self-satisfaction among cadres and the masses must be constantly overcome.

This autumn's bumper harvest is already in sight, and socialist industrial and agricultural construction is advancing by leaps and bounds at an incredible pace. Flood control headquarters at all levels must closely monitor the development of rainfall and water conditions, and with the highest vigilance and greatest determination, resolutely protect the people's production achievements and resolutely stop flood damage!

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 17th—The Yellow River has experienced its largest flood since liberation. It is expected that a flood peak with a flow rate of 22,000 cubic meters per second will appear at Huayuankou tomorrow morning.

Currently, Party and government leading organs at all levels along the river in Henan and Shandong provinces are leading the masses to fight the flood with all their might.

The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters held an emergency meeting this morning. The meeting decided to monitor changes in water conditions in order to provide timely advice to the Party and government leading organs in various locations along the river on how to defend against the flood.

After the meeting, Wang Huayun, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, has rushed from Zhengzhou to the Huayuankou Yellow River dike to inspect flood control preparations and changes in water conditions. Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, has taken ten cadres to the dangerous sections of the Yellow River dike in Heze County, Shandong Province, to assist local Party and government organs in protecting the dike. Chen Dongming, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, accompanied Peng Xiaoqian, Deputy Governor of Henan Province, to the Dongbatou area of Lankao County. Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, moved to the Henan Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters to work after holding an emergency flood control meeting.

Responsible comrades from Party and government organizations in various locations along the river have already led flood control teams to the dikes to defend them. A rescue team composed of section chiefs, division chiefs, engineers, and others from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has rushed to the Huayuankou dike with rescue equipment. A large number of flood control teams have been specially mobilized to various water diversion gates and vulnerable sections of the dikes along the river, and flood control materials have been concentrated to strengthen defenses.

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th—A reporter learned from the Central Flood Control Headquarters: The extraordinary flood caused by the simultaneous surge in the Yellow River's main stream and its tributaries, the Yi River, and the Qin River since the 16th, reached Huayuankou this morning. At 8:00 AM this morning, the flow rate at Huayuankou reached 14,900 cubic meters per second. As of 9:30 PM on the 17th, the flow rate at Huayuankou had reached 19,200 cubic meters per second. The river water is still rising.

This surge in the Yellow River was caused by continuous heavy rains in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western Henan. Flood peaks appeared successively in the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River on the 14th and 15th. On the 15th at 11:00 AM, a flood peak appeared in Shanxian, with a flow rate of 8,200 cubic meters per second. At the Baimasi station on the southern Luo River tributary, a flood peak with a flow rate of 4,300 cubic meters per second appeared at 2:00 AM on the 17th. On the night of the 16th, heavy rains fell again in the areas between the tributaries Yi, Ji, and Qin, and the main stream from Shanzhou to Qinchang, generally exceeding 100 millimeters, with 170 millimeters recorded at the Xin'an station in the southern Luo River basin. As a result, water levels in the main stream and tributaries continued to rise. At 1:00 PM on the 17th, the flow rate at the Heishiguan station on the southern Luo River suddenly increased to 8,800 cubic meters per second. The flow rate at the Wulongkou station on the Qin River also rose to 1,032 cubic meters per second at 11:00 AM on the 17th. After the flood peaks of the various tributaries met with the flood peak of the main stream, they gradually formed the Yellow River's extraordinary flood peak.

Currently, leading cadres from Party and government organizations in various locations along the river in Henan and Shandong provinces have led flood control armies to the dikes and are fully engaged in the fight against the flood.

    新华社17日讯　中央防汛总指挥部为了加强黄河防汛，坚决战胜黄河洪水，今日指示黄河防汛总指挥部，河南、山东省防汛指挥部和各省防汛指挥部。指示全文如下：
    入汛以来，黄河已胜利度过两次洪峰，其他河流的防汛也已取得很大胜利。现在北方地区连续暴雨，黄河已经出现解放以来的最大洪峰，两岸堤防将经受严重考验。我们要求黄河各级防汛指挥部领导两岸人民，再接再厉，坚决战胜黄河洪水，坚决不准黄河为害人民。
    目前汛期还刚开始，今年降雨特点是苦旱与暴雨交错发生，降雨极不均匀。因此，要求各省对防汛工作都要保持高度警惕，在旱情严重的地方也要时刻准备暴雨的突然袭击，对各河可能发生的特大洪水必需做到有措施有对策，对干部群众中存在的麻痹自满情绪必需经常注意克服。
    今年秋季的丰收已经在望，社会主义工农业建设正以一日千里的速度飞跃前进。各级防汛指挥部必需严密注意雨情水情的发展，以最高的警惕，最大的决心，坚决保卫人民的生产成果，坚决制止洪涝的为患！
    新华社郑州17日电　黄河出现了解放以来的特大洪水。预计明晨花园口将出现二万二千秒公方流量的洪峰。
    现在河南和山东两省沿河各级党政领导机关，正领导群众全力和洪水搏斗。
    黄河防汛指挥部今天上午召开了紧急会议。会议决定注视水情变化，以便及时给沿河各地党政领导机关提出防御洪水的建议。
    会后，黄河防汛指挥部副主任王化云已经从郑州驰往花园口黄河大堤，视察防汛准备情况和水情变化。黄河水利委员会副主任赵明甫带了十名干部，已赶赴山东省菏泽县黄河险工地段，协助当地党政机关防护大堤。黄河水利委员会秘书长陈东明陪同河南省副省长彭笑千已赶往兰考县东坝头一带。中共河南省委书记处书记史向生，在开过紧急防汛会议之后已搬到河南黄河防汛指挥部办公。
    沿河各地党政负责同志都已经领导防汛队伍上堤防守。黄河水利委员会组成的有处长、科长、工程师等参加的抢险队，已带着抢险器材驰赴花园口大堤。沿河各引水闸和堤防薄弱地段都特别调集有大批防汛队伍，集中了防汛料物，加强防守。
    新华社17日讯　记者从中央防汛总指挥部获悉：16日以来，黄河干流和支流伊洛河、沁河同时暴涨所造成的特大洪水，17日早晨就到达了花园口，今晨八时花园口流量即达一万四千九百秒公方。截至17日二十一时三十分，花园口流量已达一万九千二百秒公方。现在河水还在继续上涨。
    这次黄河暴涨，是山西、陕西和豫西连降暴雨造成的。14日和15日，黄河干支流就相继出现了洪峰。15日十一点，陕县曾出现洪峰，流量达八千二百秒公方；支流南洛河白马寺站17日二时出现过四千三百秒公方流量的洪峰。16日夜支流伊、济、沁和干流陕州到秦厂之间地区又降暴雨，一般均在一百公厘以上，南洛河流域的新安站达一百七十公厘。因而，干支流水位继续上涨。17日十三时，南洛河黑石关站流量陡涨八千八百秒公方。沁河五龙口站17日十一时的流量也涨到一千零三十二秒公方。各支流的洪峰和干流洪峰相遇后，就逐成了黄河的特大洪峰的出现。
    现在，河南、山东两省沿河各地党政领导干部，都已经率领防汛大军上堤，全力展开了和洪水的搏斗。
