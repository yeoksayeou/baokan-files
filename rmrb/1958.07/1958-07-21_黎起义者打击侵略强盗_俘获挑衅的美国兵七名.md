Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 20th Dispatch: Reports indicate that American aggressor troops are intimidating and provoking Lebanese insurgents in various locations. Damascus's "Al-Alam" newspaper reported today that seven soldiers of the American aggressor troops have been captured by Lebanese insurgents.

The U.S. military acknowledges that American aggressor troops have lost three aircraft in the first five days of invading Lebanon. One fighter plane was hit by Lebanese insurgents and crashed in the mountains east of Beirut, killing the pilot. The other two fighter planes crashed in the water while taking off from aircraft carriers.

On the morning of July 20th, another batch of 1,400 American aggressor troops were airlifted from Turkey to Beirut, bringing the number of U.S. troops invading Lebanon to nearly 10,000. The day before, a battalion of U.S. Marines withdrew from Beirut on July 19th, their destination unknown. Sources say they boarded an American attack transport ship anchored near the coast of Beirut.

    黎起义者打击侵略强盗
    俘获挑衅的美国兵七名
    据新华社20日讯  贝鲁特消息：据报道，美国侵略军正对各地的黎巴嫩起义者进行恫吓和挑衅。大马士革的“旗帜报”今天报道说，有七名美国侵略军的士兵被黎巴嫩起义者俘掳。
    美军方承认，美国侵略军在侵入黎巴嫩的头五天中已经损失了三架飞机。其中一架战斗机被黎巴嫩起义者击中，坠落在贝鲁特东面的山里，驾驶员毙命。另外两架战斗机是在从航空母舰起飞时在水中坠毁。
    在20日上午，又有一批美国侵略军一千四百人从土耳其空运到贝鲁特，这样，侵入黎巴嫩的美军已近万名。在前一天，有一营美国海军陆战队在19日撤离贝鲁特，去向不明。有消息说，他们登上了在贝鲁特海岸附近停泊着的一舰美国攻击运输舰。
