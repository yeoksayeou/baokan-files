    “Repairing the Earth”
    Hebei Province Zhaoxian Federation of Trade Unions Wen Zhong

    Once, I asked a friend what his wife did for work, and he said, "She's repairing the earth." It turned out that his wife was farming in the countryside, and he used such a beautiful term to describe his wife's profession.

    Later, I saw Wang Guiqin's "Holiday Return to Hometown Diary," which said that a high school graduate named Fenglan, because she didn't pass the middle school entrance exam, decided to stay in the countryside to "repair the earth." This was the second time I encountered this new term. This term is really well used! Throughout history, how many working people have been transforming the face of the earth with their ordinary hands. Building the Great Wall, digging canals, laying railways, building factories and mines, etc., have all changed the earth's surface. During the Great Leap Forward, the working masses of our country marched towards nature with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas, decorating the earth through building water conservancy projects, transforming the soil, and greening barren mountains. The working people used their strength and wisdom to make the river water give way and the high mountains bow their heads. Everything in the world is created by the working people, they are the masters of the earth, and it is well deserved to call them the people who "repair the earth."

### “修理地球”的人

    “修理地球”的人
    河北省赵县工会联合会  文仲
    一次，我问一个朋友，他的爱人在做什么工作，他说：“在修理地球”。原来他爱人在乡下种地，他用这么美的名词来形容他爱人的职业。
    以后我又看到王桂芹同学的“假期回乡日记”中，说一个高小毕业生凤兰，因没有考上中学，自己决定留在农村“修理地球”。这是我第二次接触到这个新名词。这个名词用得真好！古往今来有多少劳动人民在用平凡的双手改造着地球的面貌啊。修长城、开运河、铺铁路、建厂矿等等都使地球表面起了变化。在大跃进期间，我国的工农群众以排山倒海的气魄向大自然进军，通过兴修水利、改造土壤、绿化荒山等来修饰大地。劳动人民用气力和智慧使河水让路，高山低头。世界上的一切都是劳动人民创造的，他们是地球的主人，称他们是“修理地球”的人是当之无愧的。
