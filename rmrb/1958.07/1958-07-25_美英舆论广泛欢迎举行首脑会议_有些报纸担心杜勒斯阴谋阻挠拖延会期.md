Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: TASS, New York, July 24th: New York morning newspapers reported in large, headline-spanning characters that the Soviet government had agreed to the American and British proposal to hold a heads-of-government meeting within the framework of the Security Council to discuss the Near East situation. All radio and television stations reported this as a sensational piece of news last night.

Washington's official reaction is not yet known, but newspapers and radio stations are commenting on Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's reply to Eisenhower.

"Daily News" said: "This unexpectedly rapid response surprised the State Department like an exploding bomb."

The Soviet Union's affirmative reply to the American proposal has made such a deep impression on the State Department and caused such a sensation in the American press, which does not surprise anyone here. American newspapers do not conceal that Washington opposed the Soviet Union's initial proposal for a five-nation summit, that serious differences of opinion existed between the United States and its allies on this issue, and that the American government finally adopted a position similar to that of Britain, originally thinking that the Soviet Union would not agree to the conditions put forward in the American reply.

Some commentators, such as Drummond, bluntly called Eisenhower's reply a rejection of the Soviet proposal for a high-level meeting.

Now that the Soviet Union has adopted the American proposal, commentators believe that the United States has no possibility of retreat. These views are also the central idea of ​​all comments on Khrushchev's letter to Eisenhower yesterday. Some commentators believe that Secretary of State Dulles is plotting diplomatic correspondence on the issue of meeting members in order to delay the meeting. The possibility of this delay can be confirmed by the following news, that is, Dulles does not intend to cancel his planned visit to Europe on July 26. At the same time, newspapers believe that the Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev's proposal to invite the heads of government of India and Arab countries to participate in the meeting cannot be used as an excuse to disrupt the meeting, because inviting relevant non-Security Council member states to participate in the meeting is in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Security Council, and the United States cannot deny that these countries have a vested interest in the issues being discussed.

Most newspaper commentators, regardless of whether they agree with the idea of ​​a summit, unanimously believe that this meeting is "inevitable" and that this meeting will not "drag on" for more than two weeks.

The newspapers published Senator Humphrey's words: Khrushchev "has cornered us and dares not have any answer other than agreeing." Newspaper commentators repeated the same idea in almost all their comments in different ways. Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" that British government, as well as the public opinion of West Germany, Scandinavian countries, Japan and other countries, forced the President of the United States to reluctantly agree to the proposal to hold a high-level meeting on the Near East issue. He compared the current situation to a nightmare, in which he was "forced to do what he fundamentally did not want to do." Donovan wrote in the same newspaper: "The move towards a high-level meeting is now an unstoppable force."

Reston also estimated in the "New York Times" that although the American government "is still out of luck," the meeting will be held within the next two weeks. Reston also said that according to the views of some officials, high-level negotiations, especially secret negotiations that may be held simultaneously with open meetings of the Security Council, will produce good results.

Xinhua News Agency, July 24th: TASS, London, July 24th: When commenting on the letters exchanged between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, Macmillan, De Gaulle and Nehru, British newspapers unanimously expressed satisfaction with the Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman's quick and positive reply to British Prime Minister Macmillan's proposal to convene a meeting of heads of government within the framework of the United Nations Security Council. London officials refused to comment on Khrushchev's new letter to Macmillan before studying the text of the letter, but judging from newspaper reports, these people welcomed the letter from the head of the Soviet government. "Daily Mirror" commentator Wakefield pointed out that the fact that Khrushchev immediately adopted the proposal to hold a high-level meeting within the United Nations was welcomed in Whitehall (the British Foreign Office).

Commentators pointed out that Britain is prepared to allow Indian Prime Minister Nehru and United Arab Republic President Nasser to attend the meeting, although neither country is a member of the Security Council.

Speaking of the date of the meeting suggested by Khrushchev, British newspapers believe that Western countries will not agree to hold the meeting on July 28, because the meeting of representatives of the Baghdad Pact member states will be held in London on this day, and US Secretary of State Dulles will attend the meeting. In addition, newspapers also speculated that before going to attend the meeting of heads of government within the Security Council, Western governments will convene a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council to unify the steps of Western countries.

Many commentators in British newspapers also emphasized that there are differences between Western countries in their attitude towards the highest-level meetings. The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post", "Daily Mail", "The Times" and "Manchester Guardian" all believe that the US government is not at all enthusiastic about holding a meeting of heads of government within the Security Council.

Some newspapers also pointed out that Khrushchev's immediate expression of agreement with the British Prime Minister's opinion embarrassed the leaders of American diplomacy. The Washington correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" frankly said, "Today, the general mood in the State Department is: if the Kremlin puts forward a new objection that can shatter the hope of holding a meeting recently, so as to free American policy from an annoying and embarrassing situation, that would be what they would be happy to see."

### 美英舆论广泛欢迎举行首脑会议  有些报纸担心杜勒斯阴谋阻挠拖延会期

    美英舆论广泛欢迎举行首脑会议
    有些报纸担心杜勒斯阴谋阻挠拖延会期
    新华社24日讯　塔斯社纽约24日讯：纽约各晨报用大字标题通栏报道了苏联政府同意美国和英国关于在安全理事会范围内举行讨论近东局势的政府首脑会议的建议。各电台和电视站还在昨天晚上就把这件事情当作一件轰动一时的消息报道了出去。
    华盛顿官方的反应暂时还不知道，但是报纸和电台纷纷评论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对艾森豪威尔的答复。
      “每日新闻”说：“这个出于意料之外的迅速的答复，像一颗爆炸的炸弹似的，使国务院吃惊。”
    苏联对美国的建议的肯定答复对国务院产生这样深的印象，在美国新闻界引起这样大的轰动，这并不使此间感到惊异。美国报纸并不掩饰：华盛顿是反对苏联当初的关于五国首脑会议的建议的，在这个问题上美国同它的盟国存在严重的意见分歧，美国政府终于采取类似英国的立场，原想苏联不会同意美国复文中所提出的条件。
    有些评论员，如德拉蒙德直截了当地把艾森豪威尔的答复称为是拒绝苏联关于高级会议的建议。
    现在，当苏联采纳了美国的建议，评论员认为美国没有退却的任何可能性了。这些看法也是一切对赫鲁晓夫昨天给艾森豪威尔信件的评论的中心思想。某些评论员认为，国务卿杜勒斯阴谋在会议成员问题上来往外交函件，以便拖延会议，可以证实这种拖延的可能性的有下列消息，即杜勒斯不打算取消他预定在7月26日去欧洲访问的计划。同时，报纸认为，不能把苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫关于邀请印度和阿拉伯国家政府首脑参加会议的建议作为破坏会议的借口，因为邀请非安全理事会理事国的有关国家参加会议是符合安全理事会的议事规则的，美国不能否认这些国家对所讨论的问题有利害关系。
    大部分报纸评论员，不管他们是否赞同政府首脑会议的主张，都一致认为这个会议是“不可避免”的，以及这个会议未必“会拖过”两周以上。
    各报刊载了参议员汉弗莱的话：赫鲁晓夫“把我们逼得走投无路，除了同意以外，不敢再有别的答复”。各报评论员差不多在所有的评论中都用不同的说法重复了同样的意思。李普曼在“纽约先驱论坛报”写道，英国政府以及西德、斯堪的纳维亚国家、日本和其他国家的舆论都迫使美国总统不得不勉强地同意就近东问题举行高级会议的主张。他把当前的局势比作恶梦，在恶梦中“被迫做他根本不愿做的事”。杜诺万在同一家报纸上写道：“走向高级会议，已是有势不可挡的力量。”
    赖斯顿也在“纽约时报”上估计，虽然美国政府“仍然是时运不济”，但是会议将会在今后两周内举行。赖斯顿同时说，根据某些官方人士的看法，高级谈判，特别是可能与安全理事会的公开会议同时举行的秘密谈判，会产生良好结果。
    新华社24日讯　塔斯社伦敦24日讯：英国报纸在评论赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦、戴高乐和尼赫鲁交换的信件时，一致对苏联部长会议主席迅速而肯定地答复英国首相麦克米伦关于在联合国安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议的建议表示满意。伦敦官方人士拒绝在研究这个信件的本文以前评论赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的新的信件，但是，从报纸消息看来，这些人士对苏联政府首脑的信件抱着欢迎的态度。“每日镜报”评论员韦克福德指出，赫鲁晓夫立刻采纳在联合国范围内举行高级会议的主张这件事在白厅（英国外交部）受到了欢迎。
    评论员指出，英国准备让印度总理尼赫鲁和阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔都参加会议，虽然这两个国家都不是安全理事会的理事国。
    谈到赫鲁晓夫所建议的会议的日期时，英国报纸认为，西方国家将不会同意在7月28日举行会议，因为巴格达条约成员国代表会议将在这一天在伦敦开会，而美国国务卿杜勒斯将参加这次会议。此外，报纸还推测，西方国家政府在前往参加安全理事会内的政府首脑会议之前，将召开北大西洋公约组织理事会会议以统一西方国家的步调。
    英国报纸有许多评论员同时还着重指出，西方各国在对待最高级会议的态度上存在着分歧。“每日电讯与晨邮报”、“每日邮报”、“泰晤士报”和“曼彻斯特卫报”都认为，美国政府对于在安全理事会内召开各国政府首脑会议一点也不热心。
    一些报纸还指出，赫鲁晓夫立即表示同意英国首相的意见，这使得美国外交界领导人狼狈不堪。“曼彻斯特卫报”驻华盛顿记者坦率地说，“今天国务院总的情绪是：如果克里姆林宫提出一种可以使最近召开会议的希望破灭的新反对意见，从而使美国政策摆脱令人烦恼的狼狈处境，那将是他们求之不得的。”
