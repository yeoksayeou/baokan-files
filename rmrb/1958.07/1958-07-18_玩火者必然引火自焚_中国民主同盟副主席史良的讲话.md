Comrades:

    On behalf of the China Democratic League, I express my complete support for the statement issued by our government on the 16th regarding opposition to the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon. We express our boundless anger at the act of armed aggression against Lebanon by the US imperialists and lodge our solemn protest before the people of the world. All the people of China are overjoyed by the birth of the Republic of Iraq, and we extend our highest respects to the heroic people of Iraq and the people of Lebanon who are striving for national independence! Your victory is our victory. We firmly support you, and final victory will surely belong to you.

    We believe that the entry of US troops into Lebanon is a further exposure of the US imperialists' long-standing plot to invade the Middle East. Any reasons they hold are nonsense. Eisenhower's so-called dispatch of troops to protect American僑民(overseas Chinese) is actually a bloody suppression of the Lebanese people and a destruction of Lebanon's territorial integrity and independence. Furthermore, the mention of "Chamoun's urgent request" is an even more shameless conspiracy. Six hundred million Chinese people are very clear that the United States has always used the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique as a tool for aggression against China, and they are still supporting this tool and occupying our Taiwan. Chamoun is the Chiang Kai-shek of Lebanon, and the so-called "Chamoun's urgent request" is actually, as everyone knows, just a trick played by the US imperialists.

    It is very clear that Eisenhower's armed intervention in Lebanon is due to the victory of the Iraqi revolution. Therefore, this aggressive action by the United States is not only an interference in the sovereignty of Lebanon, but also an attempt to interfere in the Republic of Iraq, which is a blatant provocation against the national independence movements of the Arab peoples. This act of aggression seriously threatens world peace, and the people of the world will never allow the US imperialists to act recklessly in the Middle East and sit idly by.

    We want to warn the US imperialists: your current playing with fire in the Middle East will inevitably lead to your own self-immolation. The myth of "America as the world's number one" has long been bankrupt in the eyes of the people of the world. The great strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving countries and peoples of the world has become an invincible force. The anti-aggression struggles of the people of Lebanon, Iraq, and all Arab countries are by no means isolated. We, the six hundred million people of China, stand firmly and forever with the people of Asian and African countries and the peace-loving countries and peoples of the world. If the US imperialists now dare to make a desperate gamble, they will surely suffer a bloody nose and reap the bitter fruit.

    The US imperialist aggressor troops must get out of the sacred territory of Lebanon! The peace-loving people of the world will resolutely support the just struggle of the people of Lebanon and drive them out! We will never give up until we reach our goal!

### 玩火者必然引火自焚  中国民主同盟副主席史良的讲话

    玩火者必然引火自焚
    中国民主同盟副主席史良的讲话同志们：
    我代表中国民主同盟表示完全拥护我国政府16日发表的关于反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的声明。我们对美帝国主义者武装侵略黎巴嫩的行为，表示无比的愤怒，在全世界人民面前，提出我们严正的抗议。我们全中国人民为伊拉克共和国的诞生感到欢欣鼓舞，我们向英勇的伊拉克人民致以崇高的敬礼，向正在争取民族独立运动的黎巴嫩人民致以崇高的敬礼！你们的胜利就是我们的胜利，我们坚决地支持你们，最后胜利一定属于你们的。
    我们认为美军侵入黎巴嫩，是美帝国主义者长期以来企图侵略中东阴谋的进一步暴露，他们所持的任何理由都是一派胡说，艾森豪威尔所谓出兵保护美国侨民，实际上就是对黎巴嫩人民进行血腥镇压，破坏黎巴嫩的领土完整和独立。再说到什么“夏蒙的紧急请求”更是无耻的阴谋，六亿中国人民都十分清楚，美国一直就利用蒋介石傀儡集团作为侵略中国的工具，直到现在他们还在支持着这个工具，霸占着我们的台湾。夏蒙就是黎巴嫩的蒋介石，所谓“夏蒙的紧急请求”实际上谁都知道那不过是美帝国主义者耍的花招而已。
    十分明显，艾森豪威尔对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉，是由于伊拉克革命的胜利。所以美国这种侵略行动不仅是对黎巴嫩主权的干涉，同时也企图对伊拉克共和国进行干涉，也就是对阿拉伯各国人民民族独立运动的狂妄挑衅。这种侵略行为严重地威胁着世界和平，全世界的人民决不允许美帝国主义者在中东胡作非为，坐视不问。
    我们要正告美帝国主义者：你们现在在中东的玩火行为必然是对自己引火自焚。“美国世界第一”的神话，早在全世界人民面前破产了。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的伟大力量，已经成为不可战胜的力量了。黎巴嫩、伊拉克和一切阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争，决不是孤立的。我们中国六亿人民同亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民是坚决、永远和你们站在一起的。美帝国主义者现在如果真敢作孤注一掷，它一定要碰得头破血流，自食恶果。
    美帝国主义者的侵略部队必须从神圣的黎巴嫩国土滚出去，全世界爱好和平的人民，一定会坚决支持黎巴嫩的人民的正义斗争，把他们赶出去！不达目的，誓不罢休！
