    Finnish Newspaper Reveals
    American Aggressor Troops Fight to Plunder Oil
    The Finnish newspaper "People's News" stated on the 17th that the American armed intervention is the most blatant infringement upon freedom and the right to national self-determination since the Second World War.

    The newspaper pointed out that the West fears the Middle East breaking free from colonial subservience and fears losing the region's rich oil resources.

    The newspaper wrote that the American landing force is fighting for more than 3 billion US dollars in investment and profits, a dangerous gamble that Western oil monopolies have placed in the Middle East to strangle the freedom of the Arab people.

    芬兰报纸揭露
    美国侵略军为掠夺石油作战
    芬兰“人民新闻”17日说，美国的武装干涉是第二次世界大战以后对自由和民族自决权的最厚颜无耻的侵犯。
    这家报纸指出，西方害怕中近东摆脱殖民地的从属地位，害怕丧失在这个地区的丰富的石油来源。
    报纸写道，美国登陆军是为了三十多亿美元的投资和利润而作战，这三十多亿美元是西方石油垄断组织为扼杀阿拉伯人民的自由在中近东所投下的危险赌注。
