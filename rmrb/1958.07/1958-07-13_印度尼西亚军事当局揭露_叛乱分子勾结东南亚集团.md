Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 12th: Indonesian Army Intelligence Chief Lieutenant Colonel Sukendro stated in a speech on the evening of the 11th that the Indonesian rebel group is colluding with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the rebels are also selling Indonesian territory abroad.

Sukendro made these remarks at a rally held by the People's Association of Central and North Sulawesi in Jakarta. He said that the main goal of the rebel groups of the "Revolutionary Government" and the "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group is to seize power from the central government. We have ample evidence that the rebels have held negotiations in Singapore, Tokyo, and the Philippines regarding the sale of Indonesian territory. He pointed out that evidence of such traitorous activities has been collected since 1954.

Before the rebel group formally announced the establishment of a so-called "government," they held a secret meeting in Sungai Dareh, Central Sumatra. The documents from this meeting confirm that they not only hoped to obtain foreign assistance but also "cooperate" with foreign countries. These documents prove the collusion between the rebels and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Sukendro said that based on the secret documents and material evidence seized by the government forces in Pekanbaru, Sumatra, and Manado, Sulawesi, we have long known who the supporters of the rebel group are there, and we are very familiar with them. He said that the American pilot Pope, captured by the government forces, is one of the pieces of evidence that the rebels have requested foreign intervention.

    印度尼西亚军事当局揭露
    叛乱分子勾结东南亚集团
    新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚陆军情报处处长苏肯德罗中校在11日晚间发表演说时指出，印度尼西亚叛乱集团同东南亚条约组织进行勾结，叛乱分子还在外国贩卖印度尼西亚的领土。
    苏肯德罗是在中、北苏拉威西人民协会在雅加达举行的集会上说这番话的。他说，“革命政府”和“全面斗争约章”集团叛乱分子的主要目标是要夺取中央的权力。我们掌握了充分的证据，证明叛乱分子曾经在新加坡、东京和菲律宾进行过关于出卖印度尼西亚领土问题的谈判。他指出，自从1954年以来，就开始收集像这一类的卖国活动的证据。
    叛乱集团在正式宣布成立所谓“政府”以前，在中苏门答腊双溪达腊地方召开了一次秘密会议，这次会议的文件证实：他们不仅希望得到外国的援助，而且还同外国“合作”。这些文件证明叛乱分子同东南亚条约组织互相勾结。
    苏肯德罗说，根据政府军在苏门答腊的北干巴鲁和苏拉威西的万鸦老缴获的秘密文件和物证，我们早已知道叛乱集团的支持者在那里，我们也很熟悉他们。他说，被政府军俘获的美国飞行员波普就是叛乱分子曾经要求外国进行干涉的证据之一。
