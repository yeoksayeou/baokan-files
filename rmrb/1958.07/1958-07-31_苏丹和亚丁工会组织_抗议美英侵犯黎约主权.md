Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 30th: The Cairo newspaper "Al Misaa" reported on the 29th that Sudanese trade unions had submitted a memorandum to the US Ambassador in Khartoum, condemning the US armed intervention in Lebanon and the US government's indifference to world peace.

The newspaper also reported that the Aden Trades Union Congress recently protested to the British Governor of Aden against the British armed occupation of Jordan. The protest warned the British government that this new act of aggression by Britain violated the sovereignty of the Arab nation and would turn the Arab world into a graveyard for British soldiers.

The Federation also protested against the American aggression against Lebanon, saying that this action would lead the world to a devastating war.

Abbas, a representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, told an "Al Misaa" reporter that the Iraqi revolution had greatly encouraged the Algerian people's struggle for independence and freedom. He said that the revolution would also produce a good response in North African countries.

When an "Al Misaa" reporter visited Moroccan Rif tribe leader Khattabi, he said that the Iraqi revolution proved that imperialism was nearing its end. He said that the revolution would strengthen the struggle of the Moroccan people against the French occupation forces and US military bases. He also warned Western countries not to support rulers who do not represent the interests of the people.
