Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa Dispatch: The talks between U.S. President Eisenhower and Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker ended on the 10th. Eisenhower arrived in Ottawa on the 8th, accompanied by Secretary of State Dulles.

The talks took place amid serious disagreements, and no formal communiqué was even issued after the meeting. According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty, the leaders of the two governments discussed some issues between the two countries that were "causing concern and friction," but there were no specific steps to improve the "troubled relationship" between the two neighbors.

It is reported that a major topic of the talks between the two government heads was the adverse effects of the U.S. government's selfish foreign economic policies on Canada. According to Canadian newspapers, the U.S. economic crisis is now severely affecting Canada. The U.S. government's recent restrictions on oil imports from Canada, its intention to raise import tariffs on lead, zinc, and copper from Canada, and the U.S. practice of dumping "surplus" wheat abroad at low prices have caused significant losses to Canada's foreign trade. The U.S. policy of restricting trade with socialist countries also hinders the development of Canada's foreign trade. Canada now has an annual trade deficit of up to $1 billion with the United States. When Eisenhower delivered a speech to the Canadian Parliament on the 9th, Diefenbaker openly expressed dissatisfaction with U.S. economic policies, demanding that the United States "must consider the impact on other countries" when formulating economic policies.

However, Eisenhower responded coldly to Diefenbaker's appeal. He emphasized that the United States would not change its policies and told Diefenbaker not to "dwell on the differences between the two countries." In his speech, Eisenhower also opposed Diefenbaker's proposal that the Canadian government intended to shift 15% of its trade with the United States to Britain and other Commonwealth countries in order to alleviate the impact of the U.S. economic crisis on Canada. He openly attacked Canada's trade policy as "artificially changing the direction of trade."

Disagreements on the issue of trade with China also occupied a prominent place in the talks between the two government heads. The U.S. government's practice of prohibiting some companies in Canada from doing business with China has caused great dissatisfaction in Canada, but the talks did not reach a conclusion on this issue. A statement issued after the talks said, "The two governments will conduct full consultations to find satisfactory solutions to the specific problems that arise through appropriate procedures." The Canadian side's interpretation of this statement is that the two countries agreed that individuals and companies operating in Canada who want to do business with China are only subject to Canadian law, and the United States has no right to interfere. However, the U.S. side's interpretation is that the two sides only agreed on this point: that mutual consultation and research should be conducted on each issue.

The only concrete decision made during the talks was the establishment of a so-called "Joint Cabinet Defense Committee," which will "supplement in a supervisory capacity" the existing U.S.-Canada so-called "joint defense" mechanism. Participating in this committee will be the foreign ministers, defense ministers, and finance ministers of both sides.

### 美加经济矛盾消除不了  艾森豪威尔和迪芬贝克草草结束会谈

    美加经济矛盾消除不了
    艾森豪威尔和迪芬贝克草草结束会谈
    据新华社讯　渥太华消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔同加拿大总理迪芬贝克的会谈在10日结束。艾森豪威尔是在8日到达渥太华的，同行的还有国务卿杜勒斯。
    这次会谈是在严重的分歧情况下进行的，会谈后甚至没有发表一份正式公报。据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂说，两国政府领导人讨论了两国之间“引起关心和磨擦”的一些问题，但是没有什么具体的步骤来改善这两个邻国的“麻烦的关系”。
    据报道，两国政府首脑会谈的一个主要内容是美国政府损人利己的对外经济政策对加拿大造成的恶果。据加拿大报纸说，美国的经济危机现在正在严重地影响加拿大。美国政府最近限制从加拿大进口石油，打算提高从加拿大进口的铅、锌和铜的入口关税，以及美国在国外压价倾销“过剩”小麦的做法已经使加拿大的对外贸易遭到重大损失。美国限制同社会主义国家进行贸易的政策也妨碍了加拿大对外贸易的发展。加拿大现在每年对美国的贸易逆差高达十亿美元。当艾森豪威尔9日到加拿大议会发表演说时，迪芬贝克公开对美国的经济政策表示不满，他要求美国在制订经济政策时“必须考虑到对别国造成的影响”。
    但是艾森豪威尔对迪芬贝克的呼吁却反应冷淡。他强调美国不会改变政策，并且叫迪芬贝克不要“念念不忘两国之间的分歧”。艾森豪威尔在演说中还反对迪芬贝克为了缓和美国经济危机对加拿大的影响，而提出的加拿大政府打算把同美国的贸易的15％转到英国和其他英联邦国家的主张。他公开攻击加拿大的贸易政策是“人为地改变贸易方向”。
    对华贸易问题上的意见分歧在两国政府首脑会谈中也占有显著地位。美国政府禁止一些在加拿大的公司同中国做生意的作法引起了加拿大很大不满，但是会谈对这个问题并没有作出结论。会谈后发表的声明说，“两国政府将进行充分的协商，以便通过适当的程序寻找解决出现的具体问题的令人满意的办法”。加拿大方面对这个声明的解释是，两国同意，对于要同中国做生意的在加拿大营业的个人和公司，只受加拿大法律的管辖，美国无权干涉。但是美国方面的解释却是：双方同意的只是这一点：对每个问题都要互相进行磋商和研究。
    会谈作出的唯一具体的决定是成立一个所谓“联合内阁防务委员会”，这个委员会将以“监督的资格补充”现有的美加两国的所谓“联防”机构。参加这个委员会的是双方的外交部长，国防部长和财政部长。
