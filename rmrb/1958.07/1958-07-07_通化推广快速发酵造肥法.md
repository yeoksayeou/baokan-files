Tonghua Promotes Rapid Fermentation Method for Fertilizer Production

(Our dispatch) The rapid fermentation method for fertilizer production, which can quickly meet the needs of topdressing, has recently been successfully tested at the Ganmahe Agricultural Cooperative in Tonghua County, Jilin Province. Tonghua County is vigorously promoting this fertilizer production method, and it is expected that the amount of topdressing in the county this year will greatly exceed the original plan.

The method for rapid fermentation fertilizer production is as follows: Build a kang (heated brick bed) one foot high and one zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) square. On the kang, lay a layer of peat (20%), then a layer of rice bran (20%), then a layer of green grass (30%), and then pour on a layer of human manure and urine heated to 70 degrees Celsius (30%), and then seal it with soil. Finally, burn a fire in the kang stove hole until the temperature reaches 70 degrees Celsius. After 24 hours of fermentation, it can be mixed and used.

According to experienced farmers, the fertilizer effect is equivalent to pure human manure and urine.

The rapid fermentation method for fertilizer production can quickly and greatly meet the current needs for topdressing, ensuring increased crop production. Its raw materials can be replaced by other materials with similar properties; peat can be replaced by black soil, and bran can be replaced by crushed corn cobs or rice straw, etc. Manufacturing does not require a fixed site or any additional equipment, and it can be done at the edge of the village or in the fields; the operation is also very simple, and semi-laborers and women can produce it.

    通化推广快速发酵造肥法
    本报讯　能够迅速满足追肥需要的造肥方法——快速发酵造肥法，最近在吉林省通化县赶马河农业社试验成功。通化县正大力推广这种造肥方法，预计今年全县追肥数量，将大大突破原定计划。
    快速发酵造肥法的作法是：搭一个一尺高、一丈见方的火炕，在炕上铺一层草炭（占20％），再铺上一层稻糠（20％），再铺一层青草（30％），然后浇上一层加温到七十度的人粪尿（30％），再用土封起来。最后在炕洞里烧火，烧到摄氏七十度止，经过二十四小时的发酵后，即可搅拌使用。
    这种肥经过老农鉴定，肥效相当于纯粹的人粪尿。
    快速发酵造肥法能够迅速大量地满足目前追肥需要，保证农作物增产。它的原料可以用性质相近的其他材料代替；草炭可以用黑土代替，糠可以用粉碎的苞米芯子或稻草等代替。制造时不需要固定场地，也不要添置任何设备，村边地头均可举办；操作也很简单，半劳力和妇女均可生产。　（李树功）
