Rely on the Masses to March Towards Science
    Lian Bin
    Science work in Jiangxi Province is forming a mass movement. From cities to villages, from plains to mountainous areas, from scientific and technical personnel to the broad masses of workers and peasants, all have begun to participate in scientific work. This has initially changed the situation where scientific work was limited to intellectuals, breaking through the original small circle of a few people, and popularizing it among the broad masses of workers and peasants, adding new blood to the scientific ranks. The countless vivid examples reflected in the first Jiangxi Provincial Science Work Conference prove that the broad masses of workers and peasants are an indispensable and essential force in the scientific and technical ranks, and one that must be relied upon.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Science Work Conference put forward the resounding slogan of the people of the whole province marching towards science. This is unimaginable for those who doubt the correctness and necessity of this slogan. However, judging from the recent months of rapid scientific development in Jiangxi Province, the doubts are unfounded. Science is a summary of human struggles against nature and class struggles, and a generalization of natural laws and the laws of social development. The broad masses of workers and peasants are the masters of production practice and struggle practice, and therefore also the masters of science. The broad masses of workers and peasants are capable of production, capable of struggle, and therefore capable of mastering the laws of the struggle with nature. Countless inventions and creations and countless miracles in the Great Leap Forward have proven this point. The Jiangxi Provincial Science Work Conference further clarified this point of view.
    Jiangxi Province relies on the masses to march towards science, to realize the entire people running science, and to cultivate a million-strong army of scientific research. This requires liberation from the old shackles and the adoption of revolutionary measures. What revolutionary measures has Jiangxi taken? Mainly the "five-in-one" method (combining work, study, research, writing, and lecturing). This is a method based on reality, seeking truth from facts, and combining theory and practice. "Practice, improve, re-practice, re-improve" are revolutionary measures in line with the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    Jiangxi has decided to extend the "five-in-one" to all aspects and to the broad masses of workers and peasants. In this way, the source of the million-strong scientific army will naturally exist. It is not difficult for us to imagine: what kind of people will the cadres and the broad masses of workers and peasants in Jiangxi Province become? They will be practical workers and also scientific workers, students and also teachers, producers and also theoretical workers, ordinary laborers and also experts in a certain field. It is also not difficult to imagine: what a tremendous role this will play in the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. The ideals of "mechanization" and "electrification" will become reality at a higher speed.
    The main point of Jiangxi Province's march towards science is to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, so the determination is great, the energy is sufficient, and the momentum is high.
    In any work and movement, there is no disagreement in believing in the masses and relying on the masses in words, but in scientific work, there are many people who disagree with believing in the masses and relying on the masses, especially relying on the broad masses of workers and peasants, even in words, not to mention the ideological resistance. Without firmly establishing the viewpoint of believing in the masses, the policy of "the entire people running science" cannot be smoothly implemented. Therefore, putting politics in command is an important experience. It is necessary to repeatedly break down superstitions, eliminate feelings of inferiority, break the mysterious view of science, criticize the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, emphasize the role of practice in theory, and so on. As ideological and political work deepens, the scope of the people's march towards science will expand accordingly, thereby promoting the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

    依靠群众向科学大进军
    连斌
    江西省科学工作正在形成群众性的运动。从城市到农村，从平原到山区，从科学技术人员到工农群众都开始参与了科学工作，这就初步改变了科学工作只停留在知识分子的身上，而冲破原有的少数人的小圈子，普及于广大的工农群众，使科学队伍增加了新的血液。从江西省第一次科学工作会议所反映的无数的生动事例证明：工农群众是科学技术队伍所不可缺少的一支重要力量，而且是必须依靠的力量。
    这次江西省科学工作会议提出全省人民向科学大进军的响亮口号，这对那些怀疑这个口号的正确性和必要性的人来说，是不可想像的。但是，从江西省最近几个月科学大发展的情况来看，怀疑是没有根据的。科学是人类对自然斗争和阶级斗争的总结，是自然规律和社会发展规律的概括。工农群众是生产实践和斗争实践的主人，因此也是科学的主人。工农群众能够生产，能够斗争，也就能够掌握自然斗争的规律。大跃进中无数的发明创造，数不尽的奇迹，都证明了这一点。江西省科学工作会议进一步明确了这一观点。
    江西省依靠群众，向科学大进军，要实现全民办科学，培养一支百万科学研究的大军，这就必须从旧的束缚下解放出来，采取革命的措施。江西采取了那些革命措施呢？主要是采取了“五合一”的办法（工作、学习、研究、写作、讲授相结合）。这是从现实出发，实事求是，实践和理论相结合的办法。“实践、提高、再实践、再提高”，是合乎马克思列宁主义理论原则的革命措施。
    江西决定把“五合一”推广到各个方面去，推广到工农群众中去。这样，百万科学大军的来源自然就有了。我们不难想像：江西省的干部和工农群众将变成怎样的人？是实际工作者又是科学工作者，是学生又是先生，是生产者又是理论工作者，是普通劳动者又是某行的专家。也不难想像：这样作，对技术革命和文化革命将会产生多么巨大的作用。“机械化”“电气化”的理想将会以更高的速度变成现实。
    江西省向科学大进军，主要之点在于相信群众，依靠群众，所以决心大、劲头足、气势高。
    在任何工作和运动中提出相信群众依靠群众，无论如何在口头上是没有异议的，但在科学工作上提出相信群众依靠群众，特别是依靠工农群众，就是在口头上也有许多人表示不同意，那在思想上的抵触就不必说了。要不坚定地树立起相信群众的观点，“全民办科学”的方针是不可能顺利贯彻执行的。所以，政治挂帅就是一条重要经验。要反复破除迷信，打掉自卑感，打破科学的神秘观点，批判资产阶级的思想影响，强调实践对理论的作用等等。这样随着思想政治工作的深入，全民向科学大进军的范围将会随之扩大，从而促进社会主义建设的大跃进。
