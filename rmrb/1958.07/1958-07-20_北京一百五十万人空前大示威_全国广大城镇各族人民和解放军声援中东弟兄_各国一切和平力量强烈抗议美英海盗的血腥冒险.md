Xinhua News Agency, 19th: In Beijing, the capital of 600 million people, an unprecedentedly large and powerful demonstration movement against American and British imperialist aggression has taken place. Starting from 13:25 on the 18th, this movement lasted for 34 hours. Currently, all walks of life are conducting in-depth discussions and publicity on the aggressive atrocities of American and British imperialism at the grassroots level. Since noon today, more than 1.5 million people in the city have held rallies and street publicity activities of various sizes. In Xicheng District alone, 110,000 people have held major discussions.

Last night, when the people who participated in the parade during the day had not yet returned home, those who had just gotten off work took over their ranks. Without even taking a rest, they marched in groups to the road from East Chang'an Avenue to the front of the British Chargé d'Affaires office, waving flags. More than 1,500 workers from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, following the first team of more than 1,000 people who marched in the afternoon, rushed to participate in the parade immediately after getting off work at 10:30 in the evening. Many of them had not even taken off their work clothes, and the machine oil on their hands had not been washed off. Female workers from the Beijing United Textile Factory, wearing white work caps, also came out after getting off work at 11:00 in the evening.

A group of people on night duty—bus drivers, street cleaners, and night shift editors of newspapers—participated in the parade without fatigue after finishing their work.

The demonstrators marched in multiple columns, surrounding each other, towards Xingguo Road, where the British Chargé d'Affaires office was located.

When the sky was slightly bright, this road was crowded. The mercury lamps illuminated the road brightly. Under the lights, the crowds of demonstrators raised their fists and arms holding red and green paper flags, and the colorful slogans and cartoons posted on the walls of the British Chargé d'Affaires office were very dazzling. From day to midnight, people used these slogans and cartoons to cover the entire wall of the British Chargé d'Affaires building, which was about 400 meters long, and some places were as thick as 12 layers.

The people's emotions were extremely激昂 (jī'áng, stirred up). Every time a team of demonstrators passed in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires office, they stopped to shout slogans, deliver protest letters, and pour out the immense anger accumulated in their hearts. Several slogans reading "Yankees get out of Lebanon!" and "British get out of Jordan!" were posted on the vermilion gate of the Chargé d'Affaires office.

More and more demonstrators gathered. The road was filled with voices, the flow of people was endless, and angry slogans rose and fell one after another. The ranks became longer and wider, advancing like surging waves. As of the morning of the 19th, the total number of people marching in protest against the interference of American and British imperialism in the internal affairs of the Arab people had increased to more than 300,000. When the dawn had already appeared in the east, an even more powerful demonstration had begun.

This morning, Tiananmen Square, Dongdan Square, East and West Chang'an Avenue, and all the streets and alleys of the city were filled with demonstrators holding various slogans and flags. The traffic on some streets had been blocked. On many telephone poles, trees, and traffic light poles at intersections along the streets, the marching masses posted slogans protesting the American and British aggression in the Middle East.

From early this morning, Tiananmen Square became an ocean of angry people. Workers, students, government cadres, writers, and artists who came to participate in the demonstration from all directions first passed through this place, and they angrily shouted the slogan "Oppose the armed interference of American and British imperialism in the internal affairs of the Arab countries."

In the ranks of literary and art workers in the capital, writers Ai Wu and Chen Bochui, artists Wang Chaowen and Cai Ruohong, and traditional Chinese painter Yu Feian participated in the parade. Ai Wu walked in the front row of the team, holding the protest letter of the literary and art workers in the capital. Poet Sha Ou was moved by the scene of the mass demonstration, and he wrote a poem entitled "Red Waves of Anti-Aggression Soar to the Sky" during the parade.

After 8:00 in the morning, people living outside the city entered the city in rows. Workers from the Beijing Railway Bureau's engineering section immediately set out for a parade with slogans as soon as they put down their tools.

Angered by the atrocities of the United States and Britain, the broad masses of peasants in the suburbs of Beijing held meetings today. At 3:00 this morning, 3,000 members of the May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiuxianqiao Township gathered to protest the American and British aggression in the Middle East and held a demonstration. At the meeting, the members resolved to support the national independence movement of the Arab people with practical actions. The resolution called for achieving a grain yield of 600 jin per mu. Illiteracy should be basically eliminated in the township before July 25th, and a great technical revolution should be carried out.

The teams of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League arrived one after another. There were many white-haired old people in these teams, and today they were all filled with righteous indignation, shouting in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires office: "American and British aggressors get out of the Middle East! Get out! Get out!" Jiang Guangnai, a standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang who once led the 19th Route Army to bravely resist Japanese aggression, is 70 years old this year. He participated in the parade at 7:00 this morning.

More than 3,000 residents in the Guanyinsi Subdistrict of Dongcheng District rushed to the streets early in the morning to demonstrate.

The Beijing correspondent of the British Reuters news agency once said in his report that the Beijing demonstrators against the American and British aggression in the Middle East were "almost all students on vacation." If this reporter did not have serious eye problems, then he was trying to obliterate the powerful demonstration movement of people from all walks of life in Beijing against American and British imperialism with his cowardly pen. In fact, more than 100 Chinese employees and temporary workers working in the British Chargé d'Affaires office also participated in the parade today. They elected Luo Degui, a correspondent of the British Chargé d'Affaires office, to notify Eyre, the first secretary of the Chargé d'Affaires office, saying: "Our Chinese employees want to participate in the demonstration to protest against the aggression of your troops against the people of the Middle East!" Eyre had to agree to the just demands of the employees. At 10:30, more than 100 Chinese employees walked out of the gate of the Chargé d'Affaires office and shouted angrily: "British troops get out of Jordan!" Subsequently, they joined the ranks of the passing masses and marched together.

The Chinese people, who are engaged in a great leap forward in production and construction, could not restrain their angry feelings. The roar of protest against the American and British aggression in the Middle East has been shaking the sky above this historically long and peaceful city. Everyone is watching the bloody adventures of American and British imperialism in the Middle East. Beijing's newspapers issued two extra editions today, and people rushed to spread various important news. A large number of propaganda teams appeared on the streets and in the countryside, and some universities organized more than 7,000 propaganda teams to go to the streets and the countryside to carry out propaganda.

Workers and peasants held rallies of tens of thousands of people, and some held torchlight parades in the evening. In recent days, some blast furnaces in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have increased the amount of molten iron produced, and the peasants have intensified the cultivation and fertilization of crops. People want to turn their anger into the greatest material strength.

In the past few days, 130,000 employees of state-owned factories and mining enterprises in the capital have participated in report meetings, discussion meetings, and demonstrations against the American and British armed aggression in the Middle East. They all used excellent production results to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East. After listening to the report on opposing the American and British armed aggression in the Middle East on the 18th, the five workers of the Sun Guangtian group in the spun pile workshop of the Fengtai Bridge Factory transported 50 cubic meters of sand and gravel in three hours and five minutes, exceeding their original third ledger target by 61%.

The steel workers in the capital proposed to produce more steel to打击 (dǎjī, strike at) the冒险行动 (màoxiǎn xíngdòng, risky acts) of the aggressors. In the past two days, the employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have continuously held meetings and parades by workshops and work sections. All workshops have expressed their willingness to support the people of the Middle East in opposing the aggression of the United States and Britain with practical production actions. Yesterday, the No. 2 blast furnace of this factory produced 12 tons more iron than the day before. This afternoon, the steel plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and peasants and commercial workers around some factories held a rally and parade of more than 17,000 people. Liu Yin, the furnace chief of the blast furnace of this factory, said at the meeting: "We steel workers will never allow American and British imperialism to act recklessly. We must let the blast furnace produce more iron and use our steel to defend peace and打击 (dǎjī, strike at) the American and British aggressors."

Today, from dawn to dusk in the suburbs, the calls to support the Arab people and condemn the American and British imperialism's aggression in the Middle East resounded through every township and commune. From noon to now, rallies and parades have been held in various townships, with more than 800,000 people participating in these activities.

In the past two days, 110,000 members of agricultural cooperatives in 21 townships in Haidian District have gathered in villages and fields to protest the American and British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East, and unanimously proposed to turn anger into a soaring drive and support the struggle of the oppressed people with practical actions to strive for a great agricultural harvest.

The members of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoyang District unanimously stated that they should do a good job in the current production, step up summer hoeing and fertilizer accumulation, ensure the realization of this year's great leap forward plan in agriculture, and enhance the strength to defend peace. In the past, the members had to rest for three hours at noon, but these days the peasants went to the fields after lunch. This agricultural cooperative held a mass meeting at 5:00 this afternoon. Yan Hechun, a model agricultural laborer in Beijing and deputy director of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative, said angrily at the meeting that the name of our cooperative is "Peace," and our people love peace. We are extremely angry about the American and British imperialist armed aggression in Lebanon and Jordan. Our entire cooperative of 15,000 members is extremely angry. We are determined to do a good job in production, increase the strength to defend peace, and fight American and British imperialism to the end.

The sinful actions of American and British imperialism in invading Lebanon and Jordan have aroused the unparalleled anger of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the past two days, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the Air Force, the Navy, and the troops stationed in the capital have held rallies and participated in demonstrations. They warned the American and British imperialists: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the defender of peace and will never allow the aggressive conspiracy of American and British imperialism to succeed. Qin Jianbin, who won the title of first-class hero and special meritorious service in the Korean War, said: We have already fought against American imperialism in Korea, proving that it is just a paper tiger. Its days of称王道霸 (chēngwáng dàobà, acting like a king and tyrant) are gone forever. If American and British imperialism does not stop the aggression, it will inevitably encounter a shameful defeat.

Tonight, many factories and agricultural cooperatives held torchlight parades at close range after holding rallies.

Our newspaper reports that in recent days, people of all ethnic groups and the People's Liberation Army in various places have been full of indignation, and the tide of protesting against the American and British imperialism's aggression in Lebanon and Jordan has continued to sweep across the country. The broad masses have used rallies, demonstrations, and other forms to express their unparalleled anger at imperialism and their support for the struggle of the people of the Middle East countries for independence and freedom. Shanghai, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Yinchuan, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Jinan, Xining, Chongqing, Changsha, and other cities, as well as Hebei, Guangxi, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other provinces and regions, millions of working people, the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life, as well as the broad masses of Muslims in many cities across the country, have held large-scale demonstrations. Many public organizations and newspapers in Hong Kong have also strongly protested the American and British aggression. (See pages 2 and 3 today for details)

Our newspaper reports that the wave of protest against the American and British aggression against Arab countries continues to unfold and is rising in various countries around the world. Many protest rallies and demonstrations have been held in the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, and other countries.

The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council called on African and Asian countries to provide Lebanon and Iraq with emergency assistance morally and materially.

The British Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party issued statements and appeals to the people, calling on the people to take action to stop the American and British aggression against the people of the Middle East. The French Communist Party demanded an emergency meeting of parliament to discuss the Middle East events. (See page 4 of today's newspaper for details)

Further reports: The governments of Vietnam, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Indonesia, India, and Ceylon issued statements condemning the American and British armed interference in the aggressive behavior of Arab countries.

At the Security Council meeting on the 18th, the Soviet Union proposed convening an emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly to discuss the "American and British interference in Lebanon and Jordan."

The Indonesian government announced its recognition of the new government of Iraq. (See page 5 of today's newspaper for details)

    北京一百五十万人空前大示威
    全国广大城镇各族人民和解放军声援中东弟兄
    各国一切和平力量强烈抗议美英海盗的血腥冒险
    据新华社19日讯　在六亿人民的首都——北京，经历了一次历史上空前的规模巨大的反对美英帝国主义侵略的强大示威运动。从18日十三时二十五分起，这个运动延续了三十四小时。现在，各行各业正以基层为单位就美英帝国主义的侵略暴行进行深入的讨论和宣传。从今天中午开始，全市已有一百五十多万人举行了大小集会和街头宣传活动。其中西城区就有十一万人分别进行了大讨论。
    昨夜，当白天参加游行示威的人们还没有回到家的时候，刚刚下了班的人又接上了他们的队伍。他们根本没有顾得上休息，就打着旗子，成群结队地涌到从东长安街直到英国代办处门前的马路上。北京市第一机床厂的一千五百多名工人，紧接着下午第一队一千多人的游行队伍，在晚上十时半下了班又立刻赶来参加游行。他们当中很多人连工作服都没有脱，手上的机器油还没有洗掉。头上还戴着白色工作帽的北京联合纺织厂的女工们，也是在晚上十一时下了班以后才走出来的。
    有一批在夜间值班的人——公共汽车司机、街道清洁工人和报馆的夜班编辑们，刚刚结束了他们的工作，就毫无倦意地参加了游行示威的队伍。
    游行示威的人们排成多路纵队，前呼后拥地向着英国代办处所在的兴国路走去。
    当天色微明时，这条马路上被挤得水泄不通，水银路灯把马路照得通明。在灯光下，游行的人群高举着拳头和拿着红绿纸旗的臂膀，还有那些被人们贴在英国代办处墙上的五光十色的标语和漫画，显得非常耀眼。人们从白天到午夜，用这些标语和漫画贴满了整个英国代办处建筑物长约四百多公尺的墙壁，而且有的地方厚达十二层之多。
    人们的情绪极为激昂。每一队游行示威的人走过英国代办处门前时，都要停下来喊口号，递送抗议书，把积压在心头的无比愤怒，都一起倾泻在这里。有几张写着“美国佬滚出黎巴嫩！”和“英国佬滚出约旦！”的标语就贴在代办处的朱红大门上。
    示威游行的人群聚集得越来越多。马路上人声鼎沸，人流不绝，愤怒的口号声此起彼伏，更长更宽的队伍还在波涛汹涌地前进。截至19日早晨，为反对美英帝国主义干涉阿拉伯人民内政而游行示威的人群总数已增加到三十多万人。当黎明的曙光已经在东方出现时，一个声势更为浩大的示威游行已经开始了。
    在今天上午，天安门广场、东单广场、东西长安街和全城大街小巷都出现了手执各色标语牌和旗帜的示威游行的队伍，有些街道的交通已被阻塞。在街道两旁的许多电线杆上、树上、十字路口的红绿灯杆上，都被游行的群众贴上了抗议美英侵略中东的标语。
    从今天一早开始，天安门广场成了愤怒的人群的海洋。从四面八方涌来参加示威的工人、学生、机关干部、作家和艺术家的队伍，首先通过这个地方，他们愤怒地高呼“反对美、英帝国主义武装干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政”口号。
    在首都文学艺术工作者的队伍里，参加游行的有作家艾芜、陈伯吹，艺术家王朝闻、蔡若虹和国画家于非闇等。艾芜走在队伍的前排，拿着首都文学艺术工作者的抗议书。诗人沙鸥被群众示威的场面所激动，他在游行中随即写了“反侵略的红浪滔天”一首诗。
    早晨八时多，住在城外的人们纷纷列队入城。北京铁路局工务段的工人刚放下工具，立即拿着标语牌出发游行。
    被美英暴行激怒了的京郊广大农民今天纷纷集会，酒仙桥乡五一农业生产合作社的社员们今天清晨三点钟，就有三千个社员集会抗议美英侵略中东，并举行了示威游行。在会上，社员们决议用实际行动来支援阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动。决议要求要达到粮食亩产六百斤的生产计划。在7月25日以前全乡基本扫除文盲，并且要大搞技术革命。
    民革、民盟、民建、民进、农工、致公、九三、台盟等各民主党派的队伍依次的来了。这些队伍中有许多白发苍苍的老人，今天他们个个义愤填膺，在英国代办处的门前高呼：“美英侵略者滚出中东去！滚出去！滚出去！”当年曾领导十九路军英勇抵抗日本侵略者的民革中常委蒋光鼐，今年七十岁了。他今天清晨七点钟就参加了游行。
    东城观音寺办事处辖区三千多居民，一大早就赶到大街上示威游行。
    英国路透社驻北京记者曾经在他的报道里说，北京反对美英侵略中东的游行群众“几乎全部都是放了假的学生”，这位记者如果不是眼睛有了严重的毛病，那就是企图用他的怯懦的笔抹煞北京各界人民对美英帝国主义的强大的示威运动。事实上，在英国代办处工作的中国职工和临时工人一百多人今天也参加了游行。他们推举代表罗德贵——他是英国代办处的通讯员，通知代办处一等秘书艾礼雅说：“我们中国职工要参加示威游行，抗议你们的军队对中东人民的侵略！”艾礼雅对职工们的正义要求，不得不表示同意。十时三十分，一百多名中国职工走出代办处的大门，愤怒地高呼：“英国军队从约旦滚出去！”随后，他们参加了正在通过的群众的行列一起游行。
    正在生产建设大跃进的中国人民，抑制不住愤怒的心情。抗议美英侵略中东的怒吼声，一直震荡在这个历史悠久的和平城市的上空。所有的人都注视着美英帝国主义在中东的血腥冒险。北京各报今天连出了两次号外，人们奔走传告各种重要消息。街头和农村出现大批宣传队，一些高等学校就组织了七千多人的宣传队出发到街头和农村进行宣传。
    工人和农民，有的举行了万人大会，有的在晚上举行了火炬大游行。这几天以来，石景山钢铁厂有的高炉炼出的铁水增加了，农民们加紧了对作物的中耕和施肥。人们要把愤怒化为最大的物质力量。
    几天来，首都国营厂矿企业有十三万职工参加了反对美英武装侵略中东的报告会、座谈会和示威游行。他们都用优异的生产成绩声援中东人民的正义斗争。丰台桥梁工厂管桩车间孙广田小组五个工人，18日听完了关于反对美英武装侵略中东的报告后，用三小时零五十分钟的时间运输了五十立方砂石，超过了他们原订第三本账的61％。
    首都的钢铁工人们，提出要生产更多的钢铁来打击侵略者的冒险行动。两天以来，石景山钢铁厂的职工不断以车间、工段为单位举行集会和游行。各车间都纷纷表示要以实际的生产行动来支援中东人民反对美、英的侵略。这个厂的二号高炉昨天就比前天多出了十二吨铁。今天下午，这个钢铁厂和石景山发电厂、一部分工厂周围的农民和商业工作者举行了一万七千多人的大会和游行。这个厂的高炉炉长刘银在会上说：“我们钢铁工人决不允许美英帝国主义胡作非为，我们一定要让高炉多出铁，用我们的钢铁来保卫和平，打击美英侵略者。”
    今天郊区从清晨到深夜，乡乡社社响彻着支援阿拉伯人民的呼声和谴责美、英帝国主义侵略中东的怒吼。从中午到现在，各个乡镇普遍举行了集会和游行，参加这些活动的有八十多万人。
    这两天来，海淀区二十一个乡的十一万农业社社员，纷纷在村内和田头上集会抗议美、英帝国主义武装侵略中东，一致提出要把愤怒变成一股冲天的干劲，用争取农业大丰收的实际行动支援被压迫人民的斗争。
    朝阳区和平农业社的社员们，一致表示要搞好当前的生产，加紧夏锄和积肥，保证实现今年的农业大跃进计划，增强保卫和平的力量，过去社员们中午要休息三个小时，这几天农民们吃了午饭就下地。这个农业社在今天下午五时举行了群众大会，北京市农业劳动模范、和平农业社副主任燕贺春在大会上愤怒地说，我们合作社的名字是“和平”，我们的人民热爱和平，美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，我们全社一万五千名社员气愤透了，我们决心搞好生产增加保卫和平的力量，同美英帝国主义斗争到底。
    美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的罪恶行动，激起了中国人民解放军广大官兵的无比愤怒。两天以来，解放军总部、空军、海军和驻首都部队，纷纷举行集会，有的参加了示威游行。他们警告美英帝国主义者：中国人民解放军是和平的捍卫者，绝不容许美英帝国主义的侵略阴谋得逞。曾在朝鲜战争中获得一级英雄特等功臣称号的秦建彬说：我们在朝鲜已经同美帝国主义较量过，证明它不过是一个纸老虎，它称王道霸的日子已经一去不复返了。如果美英帝国主义不停止侵略，一定要遇到可耻的失败。
    今晚，很多工厂和农业社在举行集会以后，又举行了近距离的火炬游行。
    本报讯　连日来，各地各族人民和解放军群情激愤，抗议美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的浪潮，继续在全国各地掀起。广大群众用集会、游行示威等等形式，表示自己对帝国主义的无比愤怒和对中东各国人民争取独立、自由斗争的支持。上海、天津、太原、银川、南昌、郑州、广州、兰州、济南、西宁、重庆、长沙等城市和河北、广西、四川、黑龙江等省区的千百万劳动人民、解放军和各界人士以及全国许多城市的广大穆斯林，都举行了大规模的示威游行。香港许多公众团体和报纸，也强烈抗议美英侵略。（详见今日第二、三版）
