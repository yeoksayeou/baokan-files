Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 7th (TASS dispatch): Staff at the Soviet "North Pole 7" ice floe research station recently discovered a new underwater mountain range in the Arctic. This range is a branch of the Arctic Central Uplift, located on the ocean floor of the Arctic Ocean at a depth of 2,600 meters, and is nearly 560 kilometers long. It is situated between the Lomonosov Ridge and the Arctic Central Uplift, parallel to the general direction of the underwater mountain ranges of the Arctic Ocean.

Soviet scientists have obtained seabed soil samples in this area. The samples show that the bottom layer of the seabed soil dates back to ancient times. By studying the seabed sediments, it is possible to imagine what the seabed of the Arctic Ocean looked like about 100,000 years ago.

The work of exploring new underwater mountain ranges in the Arctic region is continuing.

    苏联科学家在北极发现海底山脉
    新华社7日讯据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“北极七号”浮冰科学站工作人员前几天在北极发现了一个新的海底山脉，这个山脉是北极中央高地的一个分支，位于北冰洋的深达二千六百公尺的海底，长度将近五百六十公里。它的位置正在洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉和北极中央高地之间，与北冰洋的海底山脉的总的方向平行。
    苏联科学家已在这个地区取得了海底土壤样品，从样品可以看出，海底土壤的最下层是属于远古时代。通过对海底沉积物的研究，可以想像出约十万年以前北冰洋海底形成的景象。
    在北极地带探查新的海底山脉的工作正在继续进行。
