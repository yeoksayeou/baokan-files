Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: According to a report from Deutsche Press Agency, Bremerhaven, July 28th: In addition to the "Rhine-Main" and Fürstenfeldbruck airports, the Bonn government has allocated the Kaiser Port in Bremerhaven for use by U.S. troops invading the Middle East. According to Hanover's "Neue Hannoversche Presse," the United States has "concentrated an unusually large amount of" military supplies at Kaiser Port.
    The news continues, "Heavy tanks, vehicles, and other military supplies have been transported day and night by rail and road from U.S. bases in southern Germany (West Germany) to Bremerhaven for several days. On one day alone, 300 trucks were transported... Railway freight cars loaded with tanks rumble towards Kaiser Port every night. When asked about the destination of these unusually large quantities of military supplies being assembled, the U.S. press office refused to make any statement."
    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: According to a report from Deutsche Press Agency, Bonn: Several West German bourgeois newspapers on the 28th attacked West German Chancellor Adenauer for expressing support for U.S. adventures in the Middle East during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in Bonn to discuss the situation in the Middle East.
    The "Hamburger Morgenpost" wrote that Adenauer should understand that his "complete agreement" with Dulles comes at the cost of his "complete disagreement" with the German people. The newspaper asked, "Can we truly 'completely agree' with the U.S. adventure in Lebanon that is bringing us to the brink of a Third World War? Can we truly 'completely agree' to support the corrupt regimes in the Middle East and oppose the advancing people's movements? Can we truly 'completely agree' with U.S. troops landing in foreign countries merely at the invitation of collapsing puppet figures who no longer represent any real political force?"
      The "Saarbrücker Zeitung" wrote that while people all over the world are condemning the U.S. and British armed intervention in the Middle East, the Bonn diplomats are taking a position supporting the Anglo-American actions, which can only be done by people who are politically particularly clumsy and lack instinct. The newspaper also refuted the Bonn government's claim that recognizing the new Iraqi government "is inappropriate," writing, "Do we want to add a few more 'unrecognized countries' in addition to the already nearly half of humanity living in unrecognized countries?"

    阿登纳甘心作帮凶
    又拨出凯撒港供侵略中东的美军使用
    新华社29日讯　据德意志通讯社不来梅港28日讯：除了“莱因—美因”和富斯滕费耳布鲁克机场以外，波恩政府已经把不来梅港的凯撒港供美国侵略中东的军队使用。据汉诺威的“新州报”说，美国在凯撒港“集中了异常多的”军用物资。
    这条消息继续说，“重型坦克、车辆和其他军用物资几天来夜以继日地由铁路和公路从美国在德国（西德）南部的基地运到不来梅港。仅仅在一天就运来了三百辆卡车……装载着坦克的铁路货车每晚不停地朝着凯撒港的方向隆隆地驶去。有人问到所集结的这些数量异常多的军用物资的目的地，美国新闻处拒绝发表任何声明。”
    新华社29日讯　据德意志通讯社波恩讯：好几家西德资产阶级报纸28日抨击西德总理阿登纳在同美国国务卿杜勒斯就中东局势在波恩举行的会谈中表示支持美国在中东的冒险。
    “汉堡晨邮报”写道，阿登纳应当了解，对于他同杜勒斯的“完全一致”，是以他同德国人民的“完全不一致”为代价的。这家报纸问道，“我们能真正‘完全同意’把我们带到第三次世界大战边缘的美国在黎巴嫩的冒险行动吗？能真正‘完全同意’支持中东的腐朽政权和反对前进的人民运动吗？能真正‘完全同意’美军仅仅在早已不代表任何真正政治力量的正在垮台的傀儡人物的召请下就在异国登陆吗？”
      “塞尔报”写道，当全世界人民都在谴责美英武装干涉中东的时候，波恩外交家却采取支持英美行动的立场，这的确只有在政治上特别笨拙和缺乏本能的人才干得出来。这家报纸还驳斥波恩政府所谓承认伊拉克新政府“是不适当的”这种说法，它写道，“我们是不是想在人口已经将近人类半数的未被承认的国家以外再增加几个‘未被承认的国家’呢？”
