    Joyful News of Bumper Harvest Spreads Across Thousands of Mountains
    One Season of Corn in Du'an Equals a Whole Year
    (Our Dispatch) Farmers in Du'an Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, where "nine parts are stone and one part is soil," have overcome various natural disasters, and the county's more than 640,000 mu of early and mid-season corn are showing an unprecedented bumper harvest. From the mountains to the plains, patches of already-ripe corn look so tempting. The corn stalks are six to eight feet tall, some as tall as ten feet. Each corn plant bears one to two plump ears of corn, each ear reaching six inches to one foot in length, with full kernels. Throughout the county, one can hear farmers' songs celebrating the harvest: Red flags are planted all over thousands of mountains, and joyful news of this year's bumper corn harvest is spreading.
    According to the inspection teams organized by county, district, and township Party committee leaders, agricultural cooperative leaders, team leaders, and veteran farmers, who went deep into the fields to inspect and estimate yields plot by plot, the average yield of early and mid-season corn across the county's 640,000 mu reached more than 300 jin per mu, with more than 5,400 mu yielding over 800 jin per mu. It is estimated that the total corn output for this summer harvest could reach 200.3 million jin, an increase of 70.17% compared to the same period last year. This one season of corn is 2.89% more than the total grain output of the entire year last year. According to the recent results of the acceptance inspection of more than 45,000 mu of early-maturing corn with lower yields, the yield per unit area has increased from 170 jin last year to 315 jin.

    千山万?遍传丰收喜讯
    都安玉米一季顶全年
    本报讯　“九分石头一分土”的广西省都安瑶族自治县农民，战胜了各种自然灾害后，全县六十四万多亩早、中玉米呈现出空前大丰收情景。从山区到平原，一片一片的已经黄熟的玉米长得那样诱人。玉米秆高六尺到八尺，有些高达丈余，每株玉米结着一至二个肥胖的玉米穗，每穗长达六寸至一尺，粒粒饱满，在这个县到处可听到农民喜庆丰收的歌声：红旗插遍了千山万?，喜报今年玉米大丰收。
    据该县的县、区、乡党委负责干部和农业社的社、队干部及老农组织的检查团深入田间逐块检查估产，全县六十四万多亩早、中玉米平均亩产达三百多斤，其中亩产八百斤以上的有五千四百多亩。预计今年夏收玉米总产量可达到二亿零三百多万斤，比去年同期增产70.17％，这一季玉米就比去年全年的粮食总产量还多2.89％。根据最近几天已收割的四万五千多亩产量较低的早熟玉米验收的结果，单位面积产量由去年的一百七十斤提高到三百十五斤。　（李益芳）
