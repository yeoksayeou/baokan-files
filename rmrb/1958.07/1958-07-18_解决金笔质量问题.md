    Resolving Gold Nib Pen Quality Issues
    On May 13th, the People's Daily published a letter from Chinese student studying in the Soviet Union, Comrade Yao Xiaohuang, entitled "We Must Ensure the Quality of Gold Nib Pens for Export," criticizing the poor quality of the Xinmin brand gold nib pens produced by our factory. In order to help him resolve the quality issue of the gold nib pen, we hope Comrade Yao Xiaohuang can provide us with a detailed address for contact.

    解决金笔质量问题
    5月13日人民日报发表中国留苏学生姚筱煌同志的“一定要保证出国金笔质量”的来信，批评我厂出产的新民牌金笔质量不好。为了代他解决金笔的质量问题，希望姚筱煌同志把详细地址告诉我们，以便联系。
