Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 23rd: Today's "Neues Deutschland" reported that the Politburo of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued an appeal on July 22nd via "German 904 Free Radio Station," calling on the people of West Germany to oppose the US-UK aggression in the Middle East and the West German government's support for US-UK imperialists through mass rallies, demonstrations, and resolutions.

The appeal pointed out that the broad masses of the people must be mobilized to demand in unison: No interference in Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq! World peace can only be guaranteed by forcing foreign aggressors to withdraw from the Near and Middle East. The people of West Germany should no longer tolerate West Germany being used as a springboard for imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

The appeal stated that the Politburo of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party fully agrees with the note from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the Bonn government demanding that Bonn cease providing any support to the imperialist aggressors. At the same time, it also supports the Soviet proposal for an immediate five-power summit.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: Paris dispatch: According to "l'Humanité," the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party issued a statement on the 18th condemning the US-UK aggression against the people of Lebanon and Jordan.

The statement said: "In the recent days when the people of all countries in the world have had to wage a new struggle for peace against Anglo-American imperialism, the Spanish people also need to accomplish an important mission. It is necessary and possible for the people of the whole country to rise up against the use of American bases in our country to invade Middle Eastern countries and prepare for a world war. It is necessary and possible for the people of our country to express their desire to restore Spain's traditional policy of neutrality and oppose the Franco dictatorial group's policy of abandoning national sovereignty. In this action, all left-wing and right-wing opposition parties, all social and political groups that place the interests of the nation and peace above the interests of the oligarchy that sells itself to foreign imperialism, can and should cooperate.

In this situation, the Spanish Communist Party appeals to all political forces with different tendencies, calling on them to express the united desire of the people of our country for peace in the face of serious danger, and to express the opposition of the people of our country to the use of American bases in Spain for aggression, because this will bring extremely serious danger to our country."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 23rd: According to reports from Tel Aviv, the Politburo of the Israeli Communist Party issued a statement on July 17th saying that the national anti-imperialist revolution in Iraq dealt a heavy blow to the colonialists and warmongers. This revolution greatly contributed to the struggle of the people of all countries for national liberation and strengthened the cause of peace throughout the world.

The statement emphasized that the imperialist offensive against the Arab people also constitutes a threat to Israel's security. The statement pointed out that any attempt by the Ben-Gurion government to involve Israel in the imperialist aggression against the Arab people could easily plunge Israel into a major disaster.

The statement warned the Israeli government that Israel should not interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries. The statement called on Israeli citizens to protest against the imperialist military intervention that could ignite war throughout the Middle East, and to oppose the vicious proposals calling for Israel to participate in the imperialist aggression against the Arab people.

The statement concluded by saying that it is the people of all countries, not the American aggressors, who will decide the fate of the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: TASS Paris dispatch, July 22nd: The leading body of the Algerian Communist Party published a statement in the newspaper congratulating the establishment of the Republic of Iraq and expressing "resolute condemnation of the actions of US, UK, and French imperialism aimed at depriving the Iraqi people of the fruits of their victory."

The leading body of the Algerian Communist Party pointed out in the statement that now "the Iraqi people have become a member of the family of Arab countries striving to achieve and strengthen their complete independence and unity." The statement said, "Following the Lebanese people's blow to the reactionary rule of Chamoun, this new great victory over imperialism will only strengthen the determination of the Algerians to fight for independence and strengthen the unity of the Arab world."

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 24th: The Swiss Labor Party issued a statement condemning the entry of US and UK troops into the Middle East as a blatant interference in the internal affairs of independent countries and a violation of the United Nations Charter. The statement pointed out that the US-UK armed intervention has created an extremely serious situation and brought all mankind to the brink of a third world war. The statement called on all Swiss people, regardless of party affiliation, to take joint action to save peace, condemn this act of aggression, and support all proposals aimed at leading to a peaceful solution to the Middle East issue, especially the relevant Soviet proposals, in order to avoid the growing danger of a catastrophic nuclear world war.

    严正谴责美英武装干涉中东
    德共
    新华社柏林23日电　今天的“新德意志报”报道，德国共产党中央政治局22日经由“德国904自由广播电台”发表了一项呼吁书，号召西德人民用群众集会、游行示威和通过决议等方式来反对美英在中东的侵略以及西德政府对美英帝国主义者的支持。
    呼吁书指出，必须动员广大人民同声要求：不许干涉黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克！只有迫使外国侵略者撤出中近东，世界和平才能有保障。西德人民不应该再继续容忍西德被作为帝国主义侵略中东的跳板。
    呼吁书说，德国共产党中央政治局完全赞同德意志民主共和国政府致波恩政府的关于要求波恩停止给予帝国主义侵略者以任何支持的照会。同时，它也支持苏联关于立即举行五国首脑会议的建议。

    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：据“人道报”报道，西班牙共产党中央委员会政治局在18日发表声明，谴责美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦人民的行为。
    声明说：“在世界各国人民最近几天不得不对英美帝国主义进行争取和平的新的斗争中，西班牙人民也需要完成一项重要的使命。全国人民有必要也有可能起来反对把在我国的美国基地用来侵略中东各国和准备世界战争。我国人民有必要也有可能表示力求恢复西班牙传统的中立政策、反对佛朗哥独裁集团执行的放弃民族主权的政策的愿望。在这一种行动中，所有左翼和右翼反对派，所有把民族和和平利益放在卖身投靠外国帝国主义的寡头制度的利益之上的社会和政治团体，都可以、而且应该进行合作。
    在这种情况下，西班牙共产党向所有不同倾向的政治力量发出呼吁，呼吁他们在面临严重危险的时候，通过一切可能的方式来表示我国人民希望和平的一致愿望，来表示我国人民反对把在西班牙的美国基地用来从事侵略，因为这将为我国带来极其严重的危险。”

    新华社布拉格23日电　据来自特拉维夫的消息说，以色列共产党政治局在7月17日发表声明说，伊拉克的民族反帝革命给予殖民主义者和战争贩子以沉重的打击。这次革命大大有助于各国人民争取民族解放的斗争，并且加强了全世界的和平事业。
    声明强调说，帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的进攻也构成了对以色列的安全的威胁。声明指出，本—古里安政府使以色列卷入帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的侵略的任何企图都很容易使以色列陷入大灾难。
    声明警告以色列政府说，以色列不应该干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。声明呼吁以色列公民对可能在整个中东煽起战火的帝国主义的军事干涉提出抗议，并且反对要求以色列参与帝国主义对阿拉伯各国人民的侵略的恶毒建议。
    声明最后说，决定中东命运的将不是美国侵略者，而是各国人民。
    阿尔及利亚共产党
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社巴黎22日讯：阿尔及利亚共产党领导机构在报纸上发表声明，祝贺伊拉克共和国的成立并且表示“坚决谴责美英法帝国主义目的在于剥夺伊拉克人民胜利果实的行动”。
    阿尔及利亚共产党领导机构在声明中指出，现在“伊拉克人民成了争取获得和加强本国完全独立和团结的阿拉伯各国人民大家庭的一员”。声明说，“继黎巴嫩人民打击了夏蒙反动统治之后，对帝国主义这一新的伟大胜利只会加强阿尔及利亚人争取独立和加强阿拉伯世界团结的决心。”
    瑞士劳动党
    据新华社日内瓦24日电　瑞士劳动党发表声明，谴责美英军队开进中东是对独立国家内政的粗暴干涉和对联合国宪章的破坏。声明指出，美英的武装干涉已经造成了一种极端严重的形势，并且使全人类濒于第三次世界大战的边缘。声明号召全体瑞士人民，不分党派，共同采取行动来拯救和平、谴责这种侵略罪行和支持一切目的在于导致和平解决中东问题的建议，特别是苏联的有关建议，以便避免增长中的爆发灾难性核世界大战的危险。
