Xinhua News Agency dispatch: United States President Eisenhower, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and French Premier de Gaulle, respectively wrote to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, replying to his letter regarding holding a summit conference within the scope of the Security Council.

Due to the strong pressure of world opinion, Eisenhower, in his letter of the 25th, had to once again express his agreement to a summit conference within the scope of the Security Council to discuss the Middle East situation. However, he did not put forward any concrete suggestions for the date of convening this conference, but tried to delay it. In this letter, Eisenhower also made excuses for the US and British aggression in the Middle East.

Macmillan stated in his letter that certain Middle East issues should be discussed at the Security Council meeting in New York in accordance with Article 28 of the United Nations Charter—which stipulates that heads of government may attend meetings. He advocated that the permanent representatives of the Security Council member states, in close consultation with the United Nations Secretary-General, should "without delay" begin arranging this meeting.

De Gaulle, in his reply, believed that heads of state could participate in the summit conference held within the scope of the Security Council, but he put forward different opinions on the members and the location of the meeting.

    美英法函复赫鲁晓夫
    同意召开首脑会议，并分别提出意见
    本报讯　综合新华社消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔、英国首相麦克米伦和法国总理戴高乐，分别写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，答复他关于在安全理事会范围内举行政府首脑会议的信件。
    由于全世界舆论的强大压力，艾森豪威尔在他25日的信件中不得不再一次表示同意由安全理事会范围内的首脑会议来讨论中东局势。但是，对于召开这个会议的日期，却没有提出任何具体建议，而力图加以拖延。在这封信里，艾森豪威尔同时为美英两国在中东的侵略行为进行了狡辩。
    麦克米伦在信里表示，某些中东问题应当根据联合国宪章第二十八条的规定——规定政府首脑可以出席会议——在纽约的安全理事会会议上加以讨论。他主张这个会议应由安全理事会成员国的常任代表同联合国秘书长密切磋商“毫不迟延地”开始进行安排。
    戴高乐在复信中认为各国首脑可以参加在安理会范围内举行的首脑会议，但他对会议成员和会议地址提出了不同的意见。
