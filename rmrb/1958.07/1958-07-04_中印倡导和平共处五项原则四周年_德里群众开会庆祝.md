Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 2nd - The Delhi branch of the India-China Friendship Association held a mass meeting in Delhi on the evening of July 2nd to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the signing of the joint statement on advocating the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This statement was jointly signed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Indian Prime Minister Nehru on June 28, 1954.

Mrs. Ali, the Mayor of Delhi, who presided over the meeting, said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are an effective guarantee for world peace and the progress of all countries. She said that Indians, Chinese, and Asians are proud that India and China were the first in the world to advocate these five principles.

She said that coexistence does not mean tolerating bad things. True adherence to the principles of coexistence means opposing any injustice and exploitation.

She said that the five principles must be spread to every corner of the world and made known to every household.

Professor Ansari of the Delhi Islamic University said that educators have a responsibility to ensure that the spirit of these noble principles is used to cultivate Indian college and middle school students.

Fu Hao, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in India, was invited to attend the meeting. In his speech, he pointed out that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not only a positive factor in maintaining world peace, but also a concrete manifestation of the deep friendship between the one billion people of China and India. When talking about the construction of China and India, he said, "We hope and strive to achieve greater success, so we believe that safeguarding lasting world peace is our sacred duty."

Fu Hao also said that today more and more countries have accepted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, although some people are trying to distort them. These people are trying to link the execution of the traitor Nagy by the Hungarian people with the Five Principles. This matter itself violates the Five Principles. The execution of Nagy is a matter for the Hungarian people and is entirely a matter of Hungary's internal affairs. Although there are still some people in the world who are hostile to the great Five Principles, we are convinced that the Five Principles will increasingly show their vitality in international affairs.

The meeting read congratulatory messages from Soong Ching Ling and the Sino-Indian Friendship Association.

Calcutta also held a celebration rally on June 28.

    中印倡导和平共处五项原则四周年
    德里群众开会庆祝
    据新华社新德里2日电　印中友好协会德里分会2日晚上在德里召开了一次群众集会，庆祝关于倡导和平共处五项原则的联合声明签署四周年。这项声明是在1954年6月28日由中国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁共同签署的。
    主持集会的德里市市长阿里夫人说，和平共处五项原则是世界和平和各国进步的有效保证。她说，印度人、中国人和亚洲人都因为印度和中国在世界上首先倡导这五项原则而自豪。
    她说，共处并不是意味着容忍坏事。真正遵守共处原则就是反对任何不正义的事情和剥削。
    她说，必须把五项原则传到世界的每一个角落去，做到家喻户晓。
    德里伊斯兰教大学教授安萨里说，教育工作者有责任保证用这些崇高的原则的精神来培养印度的大中学生。
    中国驻印度大使馆临时代办符浩应邀出席了会议。他在讲话中指出，和平共处五项原则不仅是维护世界和平的积极因素，而且是中印两国十亿人民深厚友谊的具体表现。他在谈到中印两国的建设情况时说，“我们希望并且努力争取获得更大的成就，因此我们认为保卫世界持久和平是我们的神圣责任。”
    符浩还说，今天有愈来愈多的国家接受了和平共处的五项原则，尽管有人企图对五项原则加以歪曲。这些人企图把匈牙利人民处决他们的叛徒纳吉同五项原则联系起来。这件事情本身就是违反五项原则的。处决纳吉是匈牙利人民的事情，完全是匈牙利的内政问题。尽管世界上还有些人对伟大的五项原则采取敌视态度，我们深信，五项原则将在国际事务中日益显示出它们的生命力。
    这次会议宣读了宋庆龄和中印友好协会的贺电。
    加尔各答在6月28日也举行了庆祝集会。
