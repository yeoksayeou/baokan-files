    Accumulate More Fertilizer in Summer, Increase Production in Autumn:
    Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and Other Provinces Seize the Opportunity to Vigorously Accumulate Fertilizer

    (By Our Newspaper) Whether the summer fertilizer accumulation work is carried out well has a great impact on the increased production of autumn crops and this winter's production. Judging from the current fertilizer accumulation situation in Guangdong, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and other provinces, the movement is developing very well, the amount of fertilizer accumulated is very large, and the quality is relatively good.
    The people of Guangdong Province achieved a great victory by seizing the opportunity to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer before the busy summer harvest. The average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu in the province has reached more than 1,100 dan. In mid-June, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China required the late rice crop to accumulate 400 dan of fertilizer per mu, doubling the target, which was broken in just a few days. Together with the cumulative number of fertilizer accumulated throughout the province since last winter and this spring, it is about 88 billion dan, equivalent to 25 times the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province last year.
    More than 50 million farmers in Sichuan Province, with their ambition of continuous revolution, ensure that more than 100 million mu of cultivated land in the province accumulates 50,000 to 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In addition to collecting green weeds and miscellaneous grasses for composting, various places also accumulate fertilizer by demolishing old walls, replacing old stoves with new ones, washing pig and cattle pens, and smoking soil fertilizer. In order to save more firewood for fertilizer accumulation, 800,000 farmers in the province have changed their firewood stoves to coal stoves. It is estimated that in Nanchong Prefecture alone, if the more than 3.5 billion jin of firewood burned were used for fertilizer accumulation, it could increase grain production by 66 million jin per year.
    During fertilizer accumulation, various methods are adopted to solve transportation problems. In order to save fertilizer transportation labor, Luxian County also adopted the method of sending coarse fertilizer nearby, sending fine fertilizer far away, accumulating fertilizer on the spot, making fertilizer on the spot, and using it on the spot.
    In Jiangxi Province, early rice in some areas suffered from floods this year, and we must strive for a bumper harvest of late rice in order to complete or overfulfill the agricultural production plan. Therefore, doing a good job in summer fertilizer accumulation is an important key.
    In the fertilizer accumulation movement, all localities have tried every possible means to open up fertilizer sources and break the conservative thinking that "no fertilizer can be accumulated." In the plain areas of the Gannan Administrative Region, wall soil and stove soil are generally exchanged, cellar fertilizer is made, cow tail stoves are promoted, granular fertilizer plants are established, field dikes are cut, ditches and canals are dug, lake mud is dug, and summer sanitation campaigns are carried out. In addition to using the above methods, mountainous areas also focus on collecting green grass and leaves from the mountains to make compost.
    According to the current situation, it is estimated that late rice fertilizer can reach the level of early rice. In this way, the situation of "late rice is grass" can be changed, and a bumper harvest of late rice can be guaranteed.
    Riding on the victory of the initial battle of the three wheat crops, the vast number of farmers in Jiangsu Province are catching waterweeds day and night on the Taihu Lake, Hongze Lake, Gaoyou Lake and other lakes and rivers with tens of millions of fishing boats. Grass cutters are everywhere on the lake beaches and river banks. People seize the great time of summer when all kinds of grasses grow luxuriantly to accumulate fertilizer, collect waterweeds, green grass, and leaves, and create green manure in a big way.
    All localities are also vigorously developing soil fertilizer. In Xilin Township, Wujin County, soil kilns for smoking soil are scattered everywhere. During the day, there are smoke dragons in the fields, and lights are everywhere at night. More than 2,000 newly built soil kilns in the township have smoked more than 200,000 dan of soil. Now the summer fertilizer accumulation movement in the province has achieved great results, and various natural fertilizers of about 15 billion dan have been accumulated in more than a month.
    In Shandong Province, the fertilizer accumulation work was not given enough prominence in the previous stage. Recently, the province has concentrated its efforts on summer harvesting and planting. The amount of fertilizer applied to summer-sown crops generally only reaches two to three thousand jin per mu, which is insufficient compared with the planned requirements and the spring fertilizer application situation. The base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops is even more unsettled. In order to change this situation, many areas are now adopting methods such as rationally allocating labor, organizing specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, and holding on-site meetings to summarize and promote typical fertilizer production experiences to strengthen specific leadership over fertilizer accumulation work.
    In the summer fertilizer accumulation movement, various localities in Shandong Province paid special attention to discovering, summarizing and popularizing advanced fertilizer production methods. After discovering that the "three-in-one" and "four-in-one" and other three methods of manufacturing soil fertilizer have many advantages, Pingyuan County quickly promoted them throughout the county. By the beginning of this month, nearly 10 million jin of soil fertilizer had been produced. (Attached picture)

### 夏季多积肥　秋季多增产  广东四川江苏江西山东等省抓紧时机大力积肥

    夏季多积肥　秋季多增产
    广东四川江苏江西山东等省抓紧时机大力积肥
    本报讯　夏季积肥工作进行得好不好，对大秋作物的增产以及今冬生产有很大的影响。就广东、四川、江苏、江西、山东等省当前积肥情况看来，运动开展得很好，积肥数量很大，而且质量也比较好。
    广东省人民在夏收大忙前抓住火候大量积肥取得了巨大的胜利，全省每亩平均积肥数已达到一千一百多担。6月中旬中共广东省委要求晚造每亩积肥四百担再翻一番的指标，不过几天就被突破了。连同去冬今春以来全省积肥的累计数约达八百八十多亿担，相当于全省去年一年积肥数字的二十五倍。
    四川省五千多万农民以不断革命的雄心，保证全省一亿多亩耕地，每亩积肥五万至十万斤。各地除采青绿杂草沤肥外，还通过拆老墙、旧灶换新、洗猪牛圈、熏土肥等办法积肥。为节省更多的柴草用来积肥，全省八十万农户已把柴灶改为煤灶，据估算仅南充专区一地，如果把烧掉的三十五亿多斤柴草用来积肥，每年就可增产粮食六千六百万斤。
    积肥中，各地采取各种办法解决运输问题。为节省运肥劳动力，泸县还采取粗肥近送、精肥远送、就地积、就地造、就地用的办法。
    江西省今年部分地区早稻遭受水灾，必须争取晚稻大丰收，才能完成或超额完成农业生产计划。因此搞好夏季积肥是重要的关键。
    各地在积肥运动中，都千方百计地开辟肥源，打破了“无肥可积”的保守思想。赣南行政区平原地区普遍进行了换壁土、灶土、制窖肥、推广牛尾巴灶、建立颗粒肥料厂、割田堤、挖沟圳、挖湖泥，开展夏季卫生大扫除等；山区除应用上述办法外，还着重向山上要青草、树叶等制造堆肥。
    根据目前情况估计，晚稻肥料可达到早稻的水平。这样，就可以改变“晚稻是草”的情况，而保证晚稻丰收。
    江苏省广大农民乘着三麦初战告捷的胜利，在太湖、洪泽湖、高邮湖等湖泊和河流，千万条农船日夜捞水草；湖滩河岸到处是割草的人群。人们抓紧夏季百草丛生的积肥大好时光，收集水草、青草、树叶，大造绿肥。
    各地还大搞土肥。武进县西林乡熏土土窑星罗棋布，白天田野一条条烟龙，夜晚遍地灯火，全乡新建的两千多座土窑已熏土二十多万担。现在全省夏季积肥运动已取得很大成绩，一个多月来已积聚各种自然肥料约一百五十亿担。
    山东省由于前段对积肥工作抓得不够突出，最近这一时期又集中力量夏收夏种，夏播作物的施肥数量一般每亩只能达到两三千斤，这与计划要求和春季施肥情况相比较，都显得不足；秋播作物的基肥更无着落。为改变这一情况，现在许多地区已采取合理搭配劳力、组织专门积肥队伍和召开现场会总结推广典型造肥经验等方法，对积肥工作加强具体领导。
    山东各地在夏季积肥运动中，特别注意发现、总结和推广先进造肥法。平原县在发现“三合一”、“四合一”等三种制造土化肥的方法具有很多优点，就迅速在全县推广开来。到本月初就制出土化肥近一千万斤。（附图片）
