A Lively Graduation Exam
Tsinghua University Department of Power Machinery Young Teachers and Students Produce Automatic Chassis Tractor

(Our Dispatch) A new type of automatic chassis tractor in our country has been designed by the Automotive Tractor Specialization of the Department of Power Machinery of Tsinghua University and was successfully trial-produced on July 1st.

This automatic chassis tractor differs from ordinary tractors in that its agricultural implements are placed between the front and rear axles, while the agricultural implements of ordinary tractors are always placed behind the tractor. Because of this feature, this tractor has a wide range of uses. It can be used for dozens of agricultural operations such as plowing, sowing, inter-row cultivation, weeding, loosening soil, and fertilizing. It can also be used for many fixed jobs, such as pumping water and generating electricity. After installing a manger on the front of the tractor, it can be used as a means of transportation like a car. Because its agricultural implements are placed in the space in front of the tractor, the tractor operator can clearly see the working condition of the implements while driving the tractor. This reduces the rate of seedling damage during inter-row cultivation and can save manpower in complex farming operations. The ground clearance of this tractor is very high and can be adjusted, so it is also suitable for inter-row cultivation of tall-stalk crops such as cotton and corn. This tractor is very light in weight. When filled with gasoline and engine oil, the total weight is only 1,185 kilograms.

The successful design and trial production of this tractor embodies the communist spirit of breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and daring to think and act. The entire design work was undertaken by three young teachers and seven graduating students. After teaching debates, they deeply felt the urgency of connecting with production practice. Therefore, they changed the graduation design topic of the students to designing an automatic chassis tractor. However, at that time, some people still had no confidence in whether this design could really be manufactured. They thought, "This type of tractor has only a little over ten years of development history, and mass production abroad has only occurred in the last two or three years. It is unimaginable for us to manufacture it." At this time, the agricultural implements exhibition opened. After seeing thousands of inventions and creations at the exhibition, they gained courage and confidence, and finally designed all the drawings within a month.

The process of manufacturing this tractor embodies the spirit of collective labor and comprehensive collaboration. In addition to the original designers and many teachers, students, and technicians from the Department of Power Machinery, the Department of Mechanical Engineering's metalworking plant and equipment manufacturing plant also invested a large amount of manpower and carried out intense production. At the same time, the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant worked overnight to supply the Jinggangshan engine used on this tractor and some of the assemblies on the chassis. The Beijing Automobile Assembly Plant made the outer cover for this tractor and painted it.

It only took seven weeks from the design and manufacture to the successful installation of this tractor. Thanks to everyone's hard work, this automatic chassis tractor could be successfully trial-produced so quickly.

### 一堂生动的毕业考试  清华大学动力机械系青年师生制成自动底盘拖拉机

    一堂生动的毕业考试
    清华大学动力机械系青年师生制成自动底盘拖拉机
    本报讯　我国又一种新型自动底盘拖拉机，已经由清华大学动力机械系汽车拖拉机专业设计出来，于7月1日试制成功。
    这台自动底盘拖拉机与一般拖拉机不同，它的农具放在前后轮轴之间，而一般拖拉机的农具总是放在拖拉机的后面。由于它具有这个特点，所以这台拖拉机的用途很广，既可以进行耕地、播种、中耕除草、松土、施肥等数十种农业操作，又可以作很多固定工作，如抽水、发电等。在拖拉机的前面装上马槽后，它又能像汽车一样，作为运输工具之用。由于它的农具是放在拖拉机前面的空间里，所以当拖拉机手在驾驶拖拉机的时候，能够清晰地看到农具的工作情况，这就减少了中耕时的伤苗率，在复杂的耕作中可以节省人力。这台拖拉机的离地间隙很高，并且可以调节，所以又适合于棉花、玉米等高茎作物的中耕。这台拖拉机的重量很轻，加满汽油与机油后，总重量只有一千一百八十五公斤。
    这台拖拉机的设计与试制成功，体现了打破迷信、解放思想、敢想敢作的共产主义风格。担任全部设计工作的是三个青年教师与七个毕业班学生。他们经过教学辩论后，深深感到联系生产实际的迫切性，因此将同学的毕业设计题目改为设计一台自动底盘拖拉机，但是，当时有的人对于这个设计是否真能制造出来，还是没有信心。他们想：“这种拖拉机一共只有十几年的发展史，而在国外大量生产也只是近二三年的事，要我们制造出来是不能想像的”。这时候，刚好农具展览会开幕了，当他们在展览会上，看到了成千成万的创造发明后，他们增加了勇气与信心，终于在一个月的时间内，把全部图纸设计出来。
    制造这台拖拉机的过程，体现了集体劳动、全面协作的精神。除了原设计人与动力系的很多教师、同学和技工外，机械系金工厂与设备制造工厂也投入了大批人力，进行了紧张的生产。同时，北京汽车制造厂连夜赶工，供给了这台拖拉机上用的井冈山发动机与底盘上的部分总成，北京汽车装配厂为这台拖拉机作了外罩并进行油漆。
    这台拖拉机从设计制造到安装成功，一共只有七周时间，由于大家的猛干、苦干，这台自动底盘拖拉机才能这样快地试制成功。
