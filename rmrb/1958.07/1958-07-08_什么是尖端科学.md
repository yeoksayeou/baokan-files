What is Cutting-Edge Science

Cutting-edge science refers to the most advanced scientific research at the forefront of scientific development, which has emerged on the basis of the high development of modern science. Due to the high development of science, it has promoted a great leap forward in technology, and the great leap forward in technology has in turn raised many new questions for science. To solve certain new technological problems, it often requires the joint efforts of many disciplines. For example, the study of nuclear physics not only elevates physics to an unprecedented new level but also powerfully promotes the rapid development of many disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and metallurgy. At the same time, nuclear physics has opened up new and broad avenues for mankind to utilize natural energy, triggering a new technological revolution in human history. Some disciplines, although with a long history, have become very old disciplines, but the emergence of new technological problems has given them new vitality, rejuvenating them. Mechanics is such a discipline. Classical mechanics had reached a considerable level of perfection during the 18th-century Industrial Revolution, but now, due to the development of high-speed flight, jet technology, and combustion theory, mechanics has been presented with a large number of new problems, and it has become one of the most dynamic disciplines today, thus making mechanics a cutting-edge discipline.

The departments of the University of Science and Technology of China, newly established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, belong to cutting-edge science. These disciplines will play a huge role in promoting industrial development, enhancing national defense capabilities, meeting the needs of modern life, and helping us build a communist society.

The research objects and content of cutting-edge science are very broad and difficult to list individually. For example, radio electronics is a discipline that studies the properties, effects, and uses of radio waves; in order to send and receive radio waves, various devices and equipment are needed, and the study of the manufacture and improvement of these devices belongs to the field of radio science. Electronics is the science of studying the laws of electron emission and motion, and how to manufacture electron tubes. Scientifically speaking, the content of radio electronics includes the generation, propagation characteristics, electrodynamics, and electron kinematics principles of electromagnetic waves; the research and design of oscillators and modulation principles that carry signals and play a transmission role, various antennas for transmitting and receiving signals, the principles of detection and amplification after receiving signals, and the manufacture of corresponding equipment for this purpose.

Other cutting-edge sciences are similar. In the great leap forward in China's production, science, and culture, to make science advance rapidly, cutting-edge science is a force that makes a deep breakthrough on the entire scientific front. (Ke Li)

    什么是尖端科学
    尖端科学是指科学发展中最前哨的一些科学研究，它们是在近代科学高度发展的基础上产生的。由于科学的高度发展，促进了技术的大跃进，而技术的大跃进又向科学提出了许多新的问题。为了解决某些新技术问题，常常需要许多学科共同努力。例如原子核物理的研究，不仅把物理学提到空前未有的新的水平上，并且有力地促进化学、生物学、冶金学等许多学科迅速发展。同时，原子核物理在为人类利用自然能源上开辟了新的广阔的道路，在人类历史上引起了新的技术革命。有的学科虽然历史很久了，已经成为很老的学科，但由于新技术问题的产生，给了它以新的活力，返老还童。力学就是这样的。古典力学在十八世纪工业革命中已经达到相当完善的地步，现在由于高速飞行、喷气技术和燃烧理论等的发展，给力学提出了大量的新问题，它已成为现在最有生气的学科之一，因而力学也就成了尖端学科。
    中国科学院新设立的科学技术大学的各系就是属于尖端科学。这些学科对于推进工业的发展，提高国防力量和满足现代化的生活需要，对于帮助我们建成共产主义社会，将起着极大的作用。
    尖端科学的研究对象和内容是很广泛的，难以逐条列举。例如无线电电子学，它是研究无线电波的性质、作用和用途的一门学科；为了使电波发送出去和接收回来就需要各种器件设备，研究这些设备的制造和改进的学科属于无线电学的范围。电子学是研究电子发射和运动的规律，和怎样制造电子管的科学。从科学上讲，无线电电子学的内容包括电磁波的产生、传播的特性、电动力学和电子运动学的原理；研究和设计携带讯号、起传送作用的震荡调制原理和震荡器，发射和接收讯号的各种天线，接受讯号后检波和放大的原理以及制造为达此目的而用的相应的设备等。
    其他尖端性科学也与此相类似。在我国生产、科学和文化的大跃进中，要使科学猛进，尖端性科学在整个科学战线上是一支向纵深突击的力量。        （柯力）
