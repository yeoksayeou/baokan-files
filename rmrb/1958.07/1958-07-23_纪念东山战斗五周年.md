Xinhua News Agency report: The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on Dongshan Island, Fujian, and the people of Dongshan County, recently carried out commemorative activities for the fifth anniversary of the victory in the Dongshan Battle. On July 16, 1953, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, instigated by US imperialism, mustered more than 10,000 people to invade Dongshan Island, Fujian Province. The People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces and militia killed, wounded, and captured more than 3,300 Chiang soldiers in just over a day. Around the fifth anniversary of the Dongshan Battle, the defending troops and local people held seminars and photo exhibitions, with reports given by officers who participated in the battle. Representatives from all walks of life in Dongshan County and the garrison troops braved strong winds and heavy rain on the 16th to pay tribute to the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed their lives in the Dongshan Island battle.

Today, as US and British imperialism are igniting the flames of war in the Middle East, and US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces unanimously expressed their determination to heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, eliminate all enemies who dare to invade, and be ready at all times to liberate our country's territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.
