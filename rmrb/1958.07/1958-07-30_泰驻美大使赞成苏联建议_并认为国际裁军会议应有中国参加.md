    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, July 29th: Thai Ambassador to the United States, Nai Thanat Khoman, told reporters in Bangkok on the 25th that he would like to see the summit conference of heads of government proposed by the Soviet Union to discuss the situation in the Middle East convened and reach an agreement.

    The Thai ambassador to the United States, who had just been summoned back to the country to report on his work, pointed out that when major powers can reach an agreement, there will be peace in the world. If war breaks out, Thailand cannot escape unscathed. Therefore, any method that can promote agreement between major powers should be adopted.

    He also said that an international disarmament conference would not achieve satisfactory results without the participation of China.
