    The Five Rams Return to Five Rams City	Poem by Ding Ming, Painting by Dong Ting
    The beautiful city has a beautiful legend,
    Guangzhou once had immortals grazing five rams.
    Wherever the sheep passed, colorful auspicious clouds rose,
    Wherever the auspicious clouds passed, the land was fragrant with rice ears.
    Today, sculptors wield knives to break stone,
    Yuexiu Mountain will erect a statue of five rams,
    The sheep gaze around in astonishment:
    Ah! This doesn't look like the place I've been before!
    Looking down, the treetops of the chimneys are floating with auspicious clouds,
    Looking up, White Cloud Mountain is embroidered with tender green new rice seedlings,
    From now on, the sheep no longer want to leave,
    Like witnesses, watching the city change into new clothes every day.
          [Street Poetry and Painting in Guangzhou]

    五羊重到五羊城	丁明诗　洞庭画
    美丽的城有美丽的传说，
    广州曾有仙人放牧五羊。
    羊群过处彩色祥云起，
    祥云过处遍地禾穗香。
    今日雕刻家挥刀破石，
    越秀山将矗立五羊雕像，
    羊群惊诧地纵目四顾：
    呵！这不像我到过的地方！
    俯视烟囱的林梢飘起祥云，
    仰望白云山上绣满嫩绿新秧，
    从此羊群不愿再行离去，
    证人似的，看着城市天天换新装。
          〔广州街头诗画〕
