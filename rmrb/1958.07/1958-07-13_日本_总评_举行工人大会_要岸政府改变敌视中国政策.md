Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 12th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō) held a workers' rally at Hibiya Park in Tokyo today to break the current deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. More than two thousand worker representatives participating in the rally firmly demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government change its hostile policy towards China.

Amidst warm applause, the rally adopted a letter of protest to the Nobusuke Kishi government. The letter pointed out that the Sino-Japanese relations established by non-governmental organizations of the two countries over the years have been unilaterally undermined by the Nobusuke Kishi government, and the relations between the two countries are facing a serious situation.

The letter pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government is relying on the United States to expand military bases and is attempting to encircle China with bases equipped with missile weapons, which is well known. The letter accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of sophistry in claiming that this is not hostile to China.

The letter demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government abolish the "Japan-Chiang Treaty" and strive to restore normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The letter pointed out that the most important thing at present is for the Nobusuke Kishi government to sever relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan.

The letter demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government express its apologies to the Chinese people for the enormous losses and suffering caused to them by Japanese imperialists during the war, and to establish good-neighborly and friendly relations with the 600 million Chinese people.

The letter also demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government issue a declaration stating that Japan will not engage in nuclear armament and that it will not participate in a Northeast Asian military alliance and will abide by the ten principles of the Bandung Conference.

The rally also adopted a declaration. The declaration pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of preparing for atomic warfare is not only aimed at China, but also tramples on the lives and rights of the Japanese people and is a provocation against the Japanese people.

The declaration emphasized that Japan must choose between two paths: one is the road to militarism that makes an enemy of the 600 million Chinese people and turns Japan into an orphan of Asia; the other is the path of promoting world peace.

The declaration called on all Japanese workers to launch a resolute movement in their workplaces and residential areas to thoroughly crush the reactionary policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The rally received a congratulatory letter from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Japanese celebrities such as Akira Kazami, Inejirō Asanuma, Kankichi Kawakami, and Kanzo Uchiyama all delivered speeches at the meeting.

After the rally, all participants held a demonstration march on the streets of Tokyo.

Sōhyō will submit the letter of protest to the Nobusuke Kishi government the day after tomorrow.

    日本“总评”举行工人大会
    要岸政府改变敌视中国政策
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天在东京日比谷公园举行了打开日中关系目前紧张局面的工人大会，参加大会的二千多名工人代表坚决要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策。
    大会在热烈掌声中通过了给岸信介政府的抗议书。抗议书指出，几年来由中日两国民间团体建立起来的日中关系，遭到了岸信介政府的一手破坏，两国关系正面临着严重的局面。
    抗议书指出，岸信介政府正在以美国为靠山来扩建军事基地，企图以设有导弹武器的基地包围中国，这是众所周知的。抗议书指责岸信介政府却狡辩说这并不是敌视中国。
    抗议书要求岸信介政府废除“日蒋条约”，努力恢复日中正常邦交。抗议书指出，目前最重要的事情是使岸信介政府断绝同台湾蒋介石集团的关系。
    抗议书要求岸信介政府就日本帝国主义者在战争期间使中国人民遭受巨大损失和痛苦向中国人民表示谢罪，并且同中国六亿人民建立善邻友好的关系。
    抗议书还要求岸信介政府发表关于日本不进行核武装的宣言，并且表示它将不参加东北亚军事同盟和遵循万隆会议的十项原则。
    大会还通过了一项宣言。宣言指出，岸信介政府正在执行的准备进行原子战争的政策，不仅是针对着中国、而且蹂躏了日本人民的生活与权利，也是对日本人民的挑衅。
    宣言强调指出，日本必须在下列两条道路中有所抉择：一条是以六亿中国人民为敌，使日本变成亚洲孤儿的走向军国主义的道路；另一条是促进世界和平的道路。
    宣言号召日本全体工人今后在自己的工作场所和居住地区展开坚决的运动，以彻底粉碎岸信介政府的反动政策。
    大会接到了中华全国总工会的贺信。
    日本社会名流风见章、浅沼稻次郎、川上贯一、内山完造等人都在会上致词。
    大会结束后，全体与会者到东京街头举行示威游行。
