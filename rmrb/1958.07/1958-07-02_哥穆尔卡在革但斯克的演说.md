Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 30th June. The Polish Press Agency reported that Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a speech at the celebration of the Shipyard Workers' Day at the Gdańsk Shipyard on June 28th. The full text is as follows: Comrades!

    Let me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, extend to you warm and heartfelt greetings at this grand meeting celebrating Shipyard Workers' Day, and express my deep gratitude for your selfless labor, which benefits both you and promotes the development of our motherland.

    Shipyard Workers' Day is a festival for maritime laborers. Because maritime laborers are not only sailors and fishermen, but first and foremost those who build ships, that is, you shipyard workers. You have delivered ships to the country, ships that today sail on almost all the oceans. You are all well aware that before the war, our coastline was not long, we had only a small merchant fleet, and almost no shipbuilding industry. Now we have learned and are able to manufacture fishing boats and large ships of tens of thousands of tons. And soon we will manufacture even larger ships equipped with modern diesel engines produced in Poland. The ships you manufacture are an important item in our country's exports, and an important item in our country's economic cooperation with the world, especially with fraternal socialist countries, and in our trade with other countries.

    People say that the sea is a gateway to the world. This is true, but the sea is not only a gateway to the world, it is also a bond connecting it. The sea should bring the people of all countries closer and connect them, not separate them. People's Poland is a country engaged in peaceful socialist construction, and it regards the Baltic Sea as a sea of peace and international cooperation.

    Compared with the pre-war period, our position in the Baltic Sea has changed, not only because we now have a long coastline, the outlets of two large rivers, and some prosperous seaports, but also because our neighbors along the Baltic Sea are now our allies and friends: the great socialist country of the Soviet Union to the east, and the German Democratic Republic to the west; our neighbors across the Baltic Sea are countries that have established peaceful and good-neighborly relations with us—Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. We will continue to actively promote the Baltic Sea as a sea of peace and international cooperation.

    The Party and the government believe that the development of the shipbuilding industry is of great significance. According to the current guidelines of the national economic plan, the output of sea-going vessels in 1960 will increase by more than 50% compared with 1957. The next five-year plan stipulates that the shipbuilding industry should be further greatly developed, and the development speed of the shipbuilding industry will greatly exceed the growth rate of the entire industrial output. By 1965, we should at least triple the tonnage of the merchant fleet compared to 1957. In addition, the shipbuilding industry will also meet the needs of exports.
  The rapid development of Polish industry
    Proves the superiority of the socialist system
    Since the establishment of People's Poland, our Party and the people's regime have attached great importance to the economic development of our country. Whether in the past or in the future, national industrialization should be the basic principle of our economic policy. In the fourteen years since the establishment of the people's regime, rapid development has been achieved in this regard. Now, Poland's industrial output has increased fivefold compared to 1938. According to preliminary plans, in the next seven years, that is, before 1965, the total industrial output value will increase tenfold compared to 1938.

    Further rapid development of our country's socialist industry is urgently needed by all Polish people. Our economic policy should also promote the development of agriculture as much as possible. However, Poland's future lies in the high industrialization of the country. This is also a basic condition for the development of agriculture.

    The reason why it is imperative to develop industry is primarily due to the continuous increase in the natural population growth rate. Our country's population increases by 500,000 every year. We must guarantee that our children and the growing younger generation have jobs and bread. The reason why we will continue to develop our industry and increase production in the future is because this is the only way to gradually improve the living standards of the working people, eliminate housing shortages, and alleviate our other deficiencies. Only by developing industry can we liberate our country and the Polish people from the economic and cultural backwardness they suffered under the rule of capitalists and landlords in the past. This is the basic task of socialism, and the basic task of our Party and the people's regime. We must mobilize the working class and all the people to complete this task.

    In the next few years, the tasks we face in further developing the national economy are arduous, but they will certainly be accomplished. Expanding industry and developing the productivity of the entire national economy mainly depend on the amount of accumulation and the amount of investment we will provide in this regard. During the Six-Year Plan period, the proportion of national income used for investment was much larger than it is now. In the recent three years, due to the substantial increase in consumption and the increase in real wages and the income of urban and rural residents, the percentage of accumulation in the national income has decreased. Despite this, the absolute amount of accumulation has not only not decreased, but has increased due to the increase in national income. Due to the expansion of productivity, especially after all the industrial projects built under the Six-Year Plan are put into production, the absolute figure of national income growth (which also means the growth of accumulation) will become larger and larger. But now the basic expenditure accounts for 15% of the national income, and this limit will have to be raised in the next few years. The possibility of gradually increasing the proportion of national income used for investment while improving the living standards depends on the increase in labor productivity and the reduction of product costs.

    We discussed these issues in detail at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee and the Fourth Congress of Trade Unions. Every enterprise must thoroughly implement the resolutions and instructions passed in this regard. The issue of gradually reducing product costs and increasing labor productivity cannot be removed from the agenda, because this is in the true interests of the working class and all the working people. We must and can produce cheaper, better, and more products. Our national economy now has great potential and possibilities to reduce the cost of products without additional investment. These potentials are primarily good organization of labor, timely supply of materials, streamlining redundant personnel, discipline of all personnel, elimination of waste of materials and defective products, cherishing tools and machines, and caring about one's work. All of these are vast areas for enterprise leaders, workers' organizations, workers' self-government councils, and workers' collectives to work in. By doing so, product costs and labor productivity can be greatly reduced. This is the source of increasing enterprise funds and increasing accumulation.

    Many factors can determine the speed of development of our industry and the entire national economy. Engineering technology and scientific work cadres are of paramount importance. We are living in a period of technological revolution in the world. These cadres, as the soul of technological development, should systematically improve their proficiency, catch up with world technological achievements, and tirelessly expand their ranks. The professional proficiency of the working class is also of the same significance. The professional level of engineers and technicians, foremen, and workers is constantly improving with the technological development of industry. At the same time, technology is constantly developing with the improvement of their professional level. In order to more rapidly develop our country's industry and improve the technical level, every staff member, from highly skilled engineers to workers, should exert all their potential to improve their knowledge and professional proficiency.

    Individual young people who are unwilling to learn, unwilling to improve their professional proficiency, and who believe that these will not affect their wages bring great harm to themselves and their country. Until now, this view could be found based on often incorrect wage policies. But everyone should be clear that wages should and will depend on professional proficiency.

    The speed of our country's economic development also depends on our foreign trade. We should constantly expand foreign trade to meet the growing needs of our industry for raw materials, as our raw materials are insufficient. The speed of our country's economic development also depends on the expansion of our economic relations with all socialist countries, on the division of labor among the European people's democratic countries (which should be reflected in the specialization of production in various countries, especially the specialization of machine manufacturing), on the mutual assistance of socialist countries, on improving the management system of our national economy, and on creating conditions to give full play to the broad economic initiative of various enterprises. It also depends on a series of other factors.
  One of the important conditions for economic development
    Is participating in the socialist camp
    In the past fourteen years, one of the most important conditions for Poland's economic achievements and the realization of our plan to further develop the national economy has been Poland's participation in the big family of socialist countries and its participation in the socialist camp. Our alliance and fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union are of particular importance to us. Without the Soviet Union's loan assistance, without the Soviet Union's machinery and means of production, without trade with the Soviet Union, we would not be able to talk about a fivefold increase in the industrial production of People's Poland today, we would not have Nowa Huta and many other industrial enterprises, and we would not have such a developed shipbuilding enterprise. You yourselves know best that your shipyard has developed primarily due to Soviet orders.

    The socialist system we have established is superior to the capitalist system. Our own practice, the achievements we have made in socialist construction, and the practice of other socialist countries, especially the practice of the first and most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, have all proved this.

    The Soviet Union built socialism single-handedly as an isolated country in twenty-seven years. This was possible because of the conditions of the historical period at that time, because of the Soviet Union's rich natural resources, because of the Soviet Union's vast size and strength, and because of the moral and political support given to it by the international workers' movement. Under the current conditions, if any country wants to build socialism on its own, it will not be able to maintain it for twenty-seven days. Because today, the international reactionary forces do not allow any country to build socialism single-handedly. In the current post-war historical period, all the countries that have overthrown the old social system and embarked on the road of socialism have been able to build socialism entirely because they have formed an unshakable big family of socialist countries, they help each other, and they have created a collective force that the international reactionary forces and capitalist forces cannot defeat through mutual solidarity. This is also entirely true for Poland. We are able to build socialism in Poland entirely because Poland belongs to the big family of socialist countries, because this big family exists. Without this big family, socialist countries could not exist. If the various socialist countries established after World War II were isolated and scattered, they would have been wiped out by the international reactionary forces.
  The revisionist theories of the Yugoslav Communists
    Are harmful to the international workers' movement
    Perhaps some people will say: There are thirteen socialist countries, but only twelve belong to the socialist camp. One of them, Yugoslavia, does not belong to and does not want to belong to the socialist camp. People say, look, the imperialists do not invade it, and let it build socialism, even though it is isolated. The answer to this question is very simple. Yugoslavia can exist as a socialist country only because there is a big family of twelve socialist countries. Every Communist Party member and every citizen in Yugoslavia must be very clear about this. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, due to its erroneous revisionist theories, has isolated Yugoslavia from the big family of socialist countries, separating it from this big Family, thereby harming the united strength of the socialist countries and the entire international workers' movement. Despite the undoubted sincere desire to ease international tensions and strengthen the forces of world peace, which the Yugoslav Party and state leaders and activists often emphasize, their negative attitude towards the socialist camp, which is the main force for world peace and the main obstacle on the road to imperialist war conspiracies, does not actually strengthen the forces of peace, but weakens them.

    Perhaps no one will deny, and even the League of Communists of Yugoslavia would agree with the fact that all international reactionaries, all imperialist forces keen on aggression, are using all means to try to split, or at least weaken and undermine, the unity of the socialist camp. Objectively speaking, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's attitude towards the socialist camp is in line with the hopes and intentions of the reactionaries. Not only that, in this conflict caused by Yugoslavia's fault and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's fault between them and all other socialist countries and all communist and workers' parties in the world, all international reactionaries have stood on Yugoslavia's side. Obviously, it would be absurd to conclude from this that the reactionaries are doing this out of love for socialist Yugoslavia. Imperialists and reactionaries are enemies of socialism. If they support Yugoslavia in this conflict, it is only because they want to split the unity of socialist countries. They also want to encourage other socialist countries to follow Yugoslavia's path and break away from the socialist camp!

    On this particularly principled and particularly important issue for socialism, the wishes of the international reactionaries coincide objectively with the tendencies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (regardless of its intentions). This is the root cause of the conflict between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and all communist and workers' parties.

    Our Party warmly hopes that the Yugoslav comrades can break away from the wrong path they are currently taking. There is no reason, absolutely no reason to justify their attitude in this conflict, which is different from the conflict from 1948 to 1954. Today, the fault lies with Yugoslavia. Our Party will always cherish the unity of the socialist camp countries as its greatest wealth, and will always implement the policy of unity of the socialist camp countries. According to this main principle of our Party's policy, we will now and in the future fight against all phenomena that undermine this unity. We harshly criticize the position of the Yugoslav Communists because it is a wrong and harmful position. We criticize in the hope that they will sooner or later understand the harm of what they are doing today.
Hungary's verdict on the Nagy group
  Is the final victory over the counter-revolutionary rebellion
    Forces hostile to socialism and imperialist aggressive blocs seize every opportunity to weaken the unity of socialist countries by any means possible, and want to create chaos in our country as well. The uproar surrounding the Hungarian court's verdict on the case of Imre Nagy and other defendants is a new example of this. Western radio stations have spread a lot of rumors about this, rumors and lies aimed at instigating people and creating chaos in our country's public. These radio stations and foreign newspapers exaggerate, saying: ... "Gomulka wrote a letter to Khrushchev protesting the Hungarian verdict...", "The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party condemned the trial of Nagy... and issued instructions to party organizations at all levels on this issue", ... and finally, "Gomulka is going to resign."

    Comrades, this is the method adopted by the reactionary propaganda serving the imperialist aggressive blocs, which rely on this method to try to weaken People's Poland, instigate the Polish people against the Soviet Union, and weaken the unity of the socialist camp.

    The Hungarian court's harsh verdict is the end of the tragic Hungarian events that occurred almost two years ago, and also the final victory in crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary at that time. It is not our business to judge the magnitude of the crime and whether the verdict in the Nagy case is reasonable. This is Hungary's internal affair.

    When recalling the Hungarian events, one cannot forget this: At that time, the fate of the Hungarian social system was at stake. Counter-revolutionary forces attempting to overthrow the socialist system and establish a capitalist system ruthlessly persecuted Communist Party members, defenders of the socialist system, and hanged them in the streets. To illustrate the tragic situation at that time, I quote excerpts from some messages in Hungarian newspapers on November 2, 1956. The Hungarian "Truth Newspaper" wrote: "Lynching occurred in the city yesterday. Such words appeared on the walls: Down with the Communist Party, down with party members, eliminate the Communist Party!"

    When the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries hanged Communist Party members, Imre Nagy, who was then the Prime Minister of the Hungarian government, broadcast on the radio saying: "No one will be punished for participating in the armed struggle." ("Free People's Daily," October 29, 1956) As a revisionist, Imre Nagy, under the pressure of the ever-increasing turmoil of counter-revolutionary forces and forces hostile to the people's regime, gradually surrendered to the counter-revolutionary forces, carried out their tasks, and attempted to strangle the socialist system in Hungary. He announced Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty and asked for assistance from imperialist countries. These facts are known to the whole world.
The West's uproar over the Nagy case
  Is an attempt to cover up their adventurous activities
    The anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement launched in the West around the verdict on Imre Nagy is serving the imperialist aggressive blocs. It is always the case that when these blocs are preparing for some serious adventurous behavior, their propaganda machines often make a big noise around the world on some other issues to confuse world public opinion and divert people's attention. The invasion of Egypt in 1956 and the simultaneous movement launched on the Hungarian events were like this. Now, dark clouds are gathering again internationally. We must not underestimate the danger from the aggressive and adventurous imperialist blocs, which are now creating tension in the Near East, continuing the arms race, and, regardless of the Soviet Union's example and suggestions, still refuse to abandon the atomic and hydrogen weapons tests that endanger mankind. The anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement organized by these blocs around the Hungarian court's verdict is poisoning the international atmosphere, exacerbating tensions, and increasing the danger of war. West Germany's policy is serving these purposes, and under the protection of the Atlantic treaty and alliance, it is strengthening the Bundeswehr, and accompanied by anti-Polish propaganda advocating border revisions, it is preparing devastating atomic weapons and rocket weapons for the Bundeswehr.

    Therefore, only naive people will be deceived by the reactionary propaganda launched around the Nagy case.

    From the example of this incident, we can see more clearly how correct the position our Party adopted in the days of October 1956 was, and how correct our political line was. The policy implemented by our Party is in line with the interests of our country and people, this policy guarantees our country's security, and helps our country further develop along the socialist road. Therefore, we have always been and will continue to strengthen solidarity and fraternal cooperation with our powerful neighbor, the Soviet Union, and all socialist countries based on the principles of internationalism, friendship, and equality. We are building a just social system, namely the socialist system, and we clearly know how beneficial the fraternal cooperation of all countries moving towards the same goal is in this regard.

    There was a time when we resolutely cracked down on the reactionary forces in Poland, who used the "theory of the second stage" to pin their illusions on the "temporariness" of our system and the people's regime. Today and at any time in the future, we will give the same resolute blow to any forces that attempt to pull Poland backward and push it into the abyss.

    Our unwavering desire is to continue to tirelessly strengthen socialism and stabilize social and political life on the basis of mutual trust between the Party and all the people united in the National Unity Front.

    Everyone working peacefully and effectively in their posts and implementing the policies of our Party and government—this is the road we are taking victoriously, and it opens up bright and beautiful future prospects for us. We can look at the future of our socialist motherland with full confidence.

    I wish you, the staff of the Gdańsk Shipyard, the builders of our country's ships, will make the greatest possible contribution to the cause of building a strong, independent, socialist Poland.

    哥穆尔卡在革但斯克的演说
    新华社华沙30日电　波兰通讯社报道了波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡6月28日在革但斯克造船厂庆祝造船工人节的大会上的演说，全文如下：同志们！
    让我在今天这个庆祝造船工人节的大会上代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会向你们热烈地衷心地致意，对你们忘我的劳动表示深深的谢意，这种劳动既有利于你们，也促进了我们祖国的发展。
    造船工人节，这是海洋劳动者的节日。因为海洋劳动者不仅仅是水手和渔夫，而且首先是那些制造船舰的人，也就是你们造船工作者。你们把船只交给了国家，这些船只今天航行在几乎所有的海洋上。你们都很清楚，战前我国的海岸线是不长的，那时我们只有一支不大的商船队，并且几乎没有造船工业。现在我们已学会、并且能够制造捕鱼汽艇，也能够制造巨大的上万吨的船。而且不久我们将制造成更大的、用波兰生产的现代柴油发动机装备起来的船只。你们所制造的船只是我国出口的重要项目，是我国在同全世界、首先是同兄弟社会主义国家的经济合作中，同其他国家进行贸易的重要项目。
    人们说，海是通向世界的门户。这是不错的，但海不仅是通向世界的门户，它还是同世界联系的纽带。海应当使世界各国人民接近，把他们联结起来，而不应把他们分割开来。人民波兰是进行和平的社会主义建设的国家，它把波罗的海看作是和平和国际合作的海洋。
    同战前时期比较，我们在波罗的海的地位已经改变了，这不仅是因为我们现在有很长的海岸线，我们有两条大河的出海口和一些繁荣的海港，而且因为现在我们在波罗的海沿岸的邻国是我们的盟国和朋友：东面是伟大的社会主义国家苏联，西面是德意志民主共和国；我们在波罗的海彼岸的邻国是同我们建立了和平的善邻关系的国家——芬兰、瑞典和丹麦。我们今后要继续积极地促使波罗的海成为和平和国际合作的海洋。
    党和政府认为，发展造船业具有重大的意义。根据目前的国民经济计划的方针，1960年的海船产量将比1957年增加50％以上。下一个五年计划规定要进一步大大发展造船业，造船业的发展速度将要大大超过整个工业产量增长的速度。到1965年，我们至少应当使商船队的吨数增为1957年的三倍，此外，造船业还将满足出口的需要。
  波兰工业突飞猛进的发展
    证明社会主义制度的优越
    我们党和人民政权从人民波兰建立以来就十分重视我们国家的经济发展问题。无论在过去和将来，国家工业化应当是我们经济政策的基本原则。在人民政权建立以来的十四年中，在这方面已经获得了突飞猛进的发展。现在，波兰的工业品产量已增为1938年的五倍。根据初步计划，在今后七年内，即在1965年以前，工业总产值将增为1938年的十倍。
    进一步迅速地发展我国的社会主义工业，是全体波兰人民所迫切需要的。我们的经济政策还应当尽量促进农业的发展。但是，波兰的未来在于国家的高度工业化。这也是发展农业的基本条件。
    所以迫切需要发展工业，首先是由于人口的自然增长率不断增长。我国人口每年都要增加五十万。我们应当保证我们的孩子和正在成长的青年一代有工作和面包。我们今后所以仍然要发展我们的工业和增加生产，是因为这是有步骤地提高劳动人民生活水平、消除房荒和我们的其他匮乏的唯一办法。只有发展工业，我们才能使我们的国家和波兰人民摆脱过去在资本家和地主的统治下所处的经济和文化的落后状态。这就是社会主义的基本任务，我们党和人民政权的基本任务。我们要动员工人阶级和全体人民来完成这项任务。
    今后几年当中，我们在进一步发展国家经济方面所面临的任务是艰巨的，但它是一定能够完成的。扩大工业和发展整个国民经济的生产力主要取决于积累的多少和我们在这方面将提供的投资的多少。在六年计划期间，国民收入用于投资的比例比现在大得多。在最近三年期间，由于消费大大增加以及实际工资和城乡居民的收入的增加，国民收入中积累的百分比减少了。尽管这样，积累的绝对数量不仅没有减少，反而因国民收入的增加而增加了。由于生产力的扩大、特别是在根据六年计划兴建的各工业项目全部投入生产之后生产力的扩大，国民收入增长（这也就意味着积累的增长）的绝对数字就将越来越大。但是现在基本开支占国民收入的15％，这个限度在以后的几年中将要提高。在提高生活水平的同时有步骤地增加国民收入用于投资的比例的可能性取决于劳动生产率的增加和产品成本的降低。
    我们在党中央第十一次全会以及工会第四次代表大会上详细地谈到了这些问题。每个企业必须彻底实现在这方面所通过的决议和指示。逐步地降低产品成本和提高劳动生产率的问题不能从议程上抹掉，因为这符合工人阶级和全体劳动人民的真正利益。我们必须、而且能够生产出更便宜、更好和更多的产品。我们的国民经济现在还有很大的潜力和可能性来降低产品的成本而不需要额外投资。这些潜力首先就是很好地组织劳动、及时做好物资供应、精简多余人员、全体人员遵守纪律、消除浪费物资和出废品的现象、爱惜工具和机器、关心自己的工作。所有这些就是企业领导、工人组织、工人自治会议和工人集体进行工作的广阔天地。照这样去作，就能够大大降低产品成本和提高劳动生产率。这就是增加企业基金和增加积累的源泉。
    有许多因素可以决定我们工业和整个国民经济发展的速度。工程技术和科学工作干部具有头等重要的意义。我们正生活在世界上进行技术革命的时期。这些干部作为技术发展的灵魂应当有系统地提高自己的熟练程度，应当赶上世界技术成就，应当孜孜不倦地扩大自己的队伍。工人阶级的业务熟练水平也具有同样的意义。工程师和技术人员、工长和工人的业务水平随着工业的技术发展不断提高。同时技术也随着他们的业务水平的提高而不断发展。为了更迅速地发展我国的工业和提高技术水平，每一个工作人员，从业务水平很高的工程师到工人为止，都应当发挥一切潜力来提高自己的知识水平和业务熟练程度。
    那些不愿意学习、不愿意提高业务水平、认为这些不会影响他们的工资的个别青年人给自己和自己的国家带来巨大的损害。直到目前为止，这种观点可以在常常是不正确的工资政策中找到根据。但是每个人应当清楚，工资应当而且也将要取决于业务水平。
    我国的经济发展速度还取决于我们的对外贸易。我们应当不断扩大对外贸易来满足我们的工业对原料日益增长的需要，我们的原料是不足的。我国的经济发展速度还取决于我们同一切社会主义国家的经济关系的扩大，取决于欧洲人民民主国家的分工（这种分工应当表现在各国的生产专业化、特别是机器制造业的专业化方面），取决于社会主义国家的互助，取决于改善我们国民经济的管理制度和建立条件来发挥各企业广泛的经济积极性，它还取决于一系列的其他因素。
  经济发展的重要条件之一
    是参加了社会主义阵营
    在过去十四年中，波兰之所以能取得经济成就和实现我们进一步发展国民经济的计划，其最重要的条件之一就是波兰参加了社会主义国家大家庭，参加了社会主义阵营。我们同苏联的联盟和兄弟友谊对我们具有特别重要的意义。如果没有苏联的贷款援助，没有苏联的机器和生产资料，没有同苏联的贸易，我们今天就谈不上人民波兰的工业生产增为五倍，我们就不会有诺瓦胡塔和其他许多工业企业，我们就不会有这样发达的造船企业。你们自己知道得最清楚，你们的造船厂首先是靠苏联的订货发展起来的。
    我们建立起来的社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。我们自己的实践、我们在社会主义建设方面取得的成就，以及其他社会主义国家的实践、特别是第一个、最强大的社会主义国家苏联的实践，都证明了这一点。
    苏联在二十七年内作为一个孤立的国家单枪匹马地建成了社会主义。这一点之所以可能，是由于当时历史时期的条件，由于苏联的丰富的天然富源，由于苏联幅员广阔和强大，由于国际工人运动给予它的道义上和政治上的支持。在目前的条件下，任何一个国家如果想要单靠自己的力量建立社会主义，那它维持不了二十七天。因为今天国际反动势力不容许任何一个国家单枪匹马地建设社会主义。在目前的战后历史时期，已经推翻了旧的社会制度和走上了社会主义道路的一切国家之所以能够建设社会主义，完全是因为它们结成了不可动摇的社会主义国家的大家庭，它们互相帮助，它们通过相互的团结创造了国际反动势力和资本主义势力所战胜不了的一支集体力量。对波兰来讲，也完全是这样。我们能够在波兰建设社会主义，完全是因为波兰属于社会主义国家大家庭，因为存在着这个大家庭。如果没有这个大家庭，社会主义国家就不可能存在。在第二次世界大战以后建立的各个社会主义国家如果是孤立分散的话，那它们原会被国际反动势力消灭的。
  南共的修正主义理论
    对国际工人运动有危害
    也许有人会说：社会主义国家有十三个，而属于社会主义阵营的只有十二个。其中有一个国家，就是南斯拉夫，它不属于、也不愿意属于社会主义阵营。人们说，你看，帝国主义者不侵犯它，让它建设社会主义，虽然它是孤立的。对这个问题的答复很简单。南斯拉夫作为一个社会主义国家之所以能够存在，只是由于存在着十二个社会主义国家的大家庭。关于这一点，南斯拉夫每一个共产党员、每一个公民都一定看得很清楚。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟，由于它的错误的修正主义理论，使南斯拉夫孤立于社会主义国家的大家庭之外，脱离了这个大家庭，从而给社会主义国家的团结一致的力量和整个国际工人运动带来了危害。尽管有着渴望缓和国际局势和加强世界和平力量的无可怀疑的真诚愿望，南斯拉夫党和国家领导人、活动家经常强调这一点，但是他们对社会主义阵营，对这个作为世界和平的主要力量、作为帝国主义战争阴谋道路上的主要障碍的阵营的否定态度，实际上不仅不能加强和平力量，反而削弱了和平力量。
    也许，谁也不会否认，甚至南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟也会同意这样一个事实，即一切国际反动派，一切热衷于侵略的帝国主义势力正在用各种手段力图分裂、或者至少削弱和破坏社会主义国家阵营的团结。客观地看，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟对社会主义国家阵营的态度，正符合反动派的希望和意图。不仅如此，在这次由于南斯拉夫的过错、由于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的过错而引起的他们同其他一切社会主义国家之间和同世界上一切共产党和工人党之间的冲突中，一切国际反动派都站在南斯拉夫一边。显然，如果有人由此得出结论，认为反动派这样做是出于对社会主义南斯拉夫的热爱，这是荒谬的。帝国主义者和反动派是社会主义的敌人。如果在这次冲突中他们支持南斯拉夫，那只是因为他们想分裂社会主义国家的团结。他们还想鼓动其他社会主义国家走南斯拉夫的道路、脱离社会主义国家的阵营呢！
    在这个对社会主义特别具有原则性和特别重要的问题上，国际反动派的意愿同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的趋向（不管它的本意如何）在客观上是相吻合的。这是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同一切共产党和工人党发生冲突的根源。
    我们党热烈希望南斯拉夫同志能够脱离他们现在所走的那条错误的道路。没有什么理由，绝对没有什么理由来为他们在这次冲突中的态度辩护，这次冲突同1948年到1954年的冲突是不同的。今天，过错在于南斯拉夫。我们党将永远像珍惜最大的财富一样珍惜社会主义阵营国家的团结，将永远实行社会主义阵营各国团结的政策。根据我党政策的这个主要原则，我们现在和将来都要同一切破坏这种团结的现象作斗争。我们严厉地批评南斯拉夫共产主义者的立场，因为这是错误的和有害的立场。我们进行批评，是希望他们早晚能够明白他们今天的所作所为的害处。匈牙利对纳吉集团的判决
  是对反革命叛乱的最后胜利
    敌视社会主义的势力和帝国主义侵略集团利用一切机会不择任何手段地企图削弱社会主义国家的团结一致，想在我国也造成混乱。这些势力围绕着匈牙利法院对纳吉·伊姆雷和其他被告的案件的判决大肆叫嚣，就是这方面的新例证。西方电台为此造了很多谣言，这些谣言和谎话是为了煽惑人心，在我国公众中制造混乱。这些电台和外国报纸危言耸听，说什么：……“哥穆尔卡写信给赫鲁晓夫抗议匈牙利的判决……”，“波兰统一工人党中央委员会谴责对纳吉的审判……就这个问题向各级党组织发出了指示”，……最后还有，“哥穆尔卡要辞职了”。
    同志们，为帝国主义侵略集团服务的反动宣传采用的方法就是这样的，这些集团依靠这种方法力图削弱人民波兰，煽动波兰人民反对苏联，削弱社会主义国家阵营的团结一致。
    匈牙利法院的严厉判决是差不多两年以前发生的悲剧性的匈牙利事件的结局，也是粉碎当时的匈牙利反革命叛乱的最后胜利。判断罪行的大小和对纳吉案件的判决是否合理，这并不是我们的事情。这是匈牙利的内政。
    在回忆匈牙利事件的时候，不能忘记这一点：当时匈牙利社会制度的命运处在生死关头。企图推翻社会主义制度和建立资本主义制度的反革命势力，残酷无情地迫害共产党员、社会主义制度的捍卫者，把他们绞死在街上。为了说明当时的悲惨景象，我引用1956年11月2日匈牙利报纸上的一些消息的片断。匈牙利“真理报”写道：“昨天在市内发生了私刑拷打。墙上出现了这样的字样：打倒共产党，打倒党员，消灭共产党！”
    当匈牙利的反革命分子绞死共产党员的时候，当时作为匈牙利政府总理的纳吉·伊姆雷却在电台广播说：“任何人都不会因为参加武装斗争而受到惩办。”（1956年10月29日“自由人民报”）作为修正主义分子的纳吉·伊姆雷，在反革命势力和敌视人民政权的势力不断加剧的骚动的压力下，步步向反革命势力投降，执行他们的任务，企图扼杀匈牙利的社会主义制度。他宣布匈牙利退出华沙条约，并且向帝国主义国家求援。这些事实是全世界都知道的。西方利用纳吉案件进行叫嚷
  是企图掩盖他们的冒险活动
    在西方围绕着对纳吉·伊姆雷的判决所发动的反苏反共运动是为帝国主义侵略集团所效劳。事情总是这样，当这些集团正在准备某种严重的冒险行为的时候，它们的宣传机器常常就某些其他问题在全世界大事叫嚷，来迷惑世界公众和转移人们的注意力，1956年侵略埃及的事件以及同时就匈牙利事件所发动的运动就是这样。现在，在国际上乌云又在聚集。我们决不能低估来自侵略的和冒险的帝国主义集团的危险，它们现在又在近东制造紧张局势，继续进行军备竞赛，并且不顾苏联的榜样和建议，仍然拒绝放弃危害人类的原子武器和氢武器试验。这些集团就匈牙利法院的判决所组织的反苏反共运动，正在毒化国际气氛，加剧紧张局势，增加战争危险。西德的政策正是为这些目的服务的，它在大西洋的公约和联盟的庇护下正在加强联邦国防军，它在反波兰的、主张修改边界的宣传的伴奏下，正在为联邦国防军准备着毁灭一切的原子武器和火箭武器。
    因此，只有天真的人才会受围绕纳吉案件所发动的反动宣传的欺骗。
    从这件事的例子中，我们可以更清楚地看出，我们党在1956年10月的日子里所采取的立场是多么正确，我们的政治路线是多么正确。我们党所执行的政策是符合我们国家和人民的利益的，这个政策保障了我国安全，并且有助于我国沿着社会主义道路进一步发展。因此，我们过去一向是、将来仍然要根据国际主义、友谊和平等的原则加强同我们强大的邻国苏联和所有社会主义国家的团结和兄弟合作。我们正在建立一个正义的社会制度，即社会主义制度，我们清楚地知道，走向同一目的的所有国家的兄弟合作在这方面是多么有益。
    有一个时期，我们曾对波兰的反动势力进行坚决的打击，它们利用“第二阶段的理论”。把自己的幻想寄托在我们制度和人民政权的“暂时性”之上。今天以及将来任何时候，只要想拉着波兰倒退、把它推进深渊里去的势力企图抬头，我们就将给予同样坚决的打击。
    我们坚定不移的愿望是在党和团结在民族统一战线里的全体人民互相信任的基础上，继续不倦地加强社会主义，稳定社会生活和政治生活。
    每一个人在自己岗位上安心地、有成效地劳动以及贯彻我们党和政府的政策——这就是我们正在胜利地走着的道路，它给我们打开光辉美好的未来的前景。我们可以满怀信心地注视着我们社会主义祖国的未来。
    祝你们，革但斯克造船厂的工作人员、我国船只的建造者，在参加建设强大的、独立的、社会主义波兰的事业中，作出尽可能大的功绩。
