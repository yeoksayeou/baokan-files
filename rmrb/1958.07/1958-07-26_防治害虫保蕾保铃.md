Current agricultural production issues that should be noted:

    Pest Control to Protect Buds and Bolls
    Currently, the numbers of cotton boll stage leafhoppers and blind bugs are increasing. The second generation of cotton bollworms is about to flourish in cotton fields, and the second generation of pink bollworms will also start to cause damage. Other cotton pests such as red spiders, cotton loopers, and leaf rollers will also be appearing soon. These situations indicate that pest control, protecting buds and bolls, is the prominent task in current cotton production. This year, cotton fields have been heavily fertilized with high density, and the cotton plants have lush and shady foliage. Such cotton fields are most suitable for the breeding and harming of cotton pests. Based on this characteristic, we must closely monitor pest conditions and eliminate them thoroughly and separately in our prevention and control work.
    This year, the supply of chemical pesticides is relatively tight. Every region should cherish the existing agents and use them economically. To achieve this goal, we must have a good grasp of the pest situation, seize the most favorable timing for applying pesticides; improve pest control technology, correctly grasp the concentration of pesticide use, and eliminate missed plants and incomplete treatments. Regions with insufficient pesticides should give full play to the wisdom of the masses and adopt local methods and local medicines to eliminate pests. Local experiences have proven that using poplar and willow branches to trap and netting can effectively eliminate cotton bollworm moths; picking up and destroying fallen buds and bolls and picking off wilted flowers can also eliminate pink bollworms and cotton bollworms within them.
    Currently, cotton field management such as topdressing, weeding, and pruning is already very busy. Many regions also have to carry out central tasks such as accumulating fertilizer and flood control simultaneously. If labor allocation is improper, it will squeeze out pest control work or delay the timing of pest control. According to experience, agricultural cooperatives can achieve very good results by forming specialized pest control teams or shock teams and shock groups. In the pest control operation process, leading cadres should go deep into the fields for inspection and research, do a good job in the organization and matching of labor, and improve operating methods to improve efficiency and save labor.

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

    防治害虫保蕾保铃
    目前棉花蕾铃期的叶跳虫、盲椿象都有上升，棉田第二代棉铃虫即将盛发，第二代红铃虫也将要为害了。其他棉虫如：红蜘蛛、造桥虫、卷叶虫等的发生，也为期不远。这些情况说明，防治虫害，保蕾、保铃是当前棉花生产中的突出任务。今年棉田施肥多，密度大，棉株枝叶繁茂荫蔽。这样的棉田最适宜棉花害虫的繁殖为害。根据这个特点，在防治工作上要抓紧监视虫情，及时地分别彻底消灭。
    今年化学农药的供应比较紧张，每个地区都应当珍视已有的药剂，经济使用。要想达到这个目的，就必须很好地掌握虫情，抓住最有利的时机用药；提高治虫技术，正确掌握用药浓度，消灭丢棵漏治等。药剂不足地区，要充分发挥群众的智慧采用土法土药，消灭虫害。各地经验证明，用杨树、柳树枝诱和网捕都能有效地消灭棉铃虫蛾；拾毁落蕾、落铃和摘毁败花，也能消灭其中的红铃虫、棉铃虫等。
    目前棉田管理如追肥、除草、整枝等已经很忙，不少地区同时还要进行积肥、防汛等中心工作，如果劳力调配失当，就会挤掉治虫工作或延误治虫时机。根据经验，农业社组成专业治虫队或突击队、突击组，都可以取得很好的成绩。在治虫操作过程中，领导干部深入田间检查研究，做好劳力的组织搭配、改进操作方式，也能提高效率，节省劳力。（附图片）
