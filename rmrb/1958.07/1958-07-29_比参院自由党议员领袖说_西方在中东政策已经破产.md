Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, July 26th - According to TASS, Brussels, July 26th: Moureaux, leader of the Liberal Party parliamentary group in the Belgian Senate, published an article in "Le Soir" on the 26th, condemning the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in the Middle East. He pointed out that this intervention has created a situation where the slightest mistake could lead to the worst outcome.

Moureaux criticized the Western countries' policy in the Middle East. He believes that this policy is incompatible with the interests of Arab countries. He wrote that all the most authoritative Middle East experts have known for a long time that the West's policy in the region is clearly heading for bankruptcy. In Arab countries, supporting feudal systems that are maintained by force and money and further impoverish the people means that one will sooner or later be met with hostility and will eventually be opposed.

    比参院自由党议员领袖说
    西方在中东政策已经破产
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔26日讯：比利时参议院自由党议会党团领袖穆罗26日在“晚报”发表一篇文章，谴责美英对中东的武装干涉。他指出这种干涉造成了这样一种局势：极其微小的失误就可能引起最坏的事情。
    穆罗抨击西方国家在中东的政策。他认为，这个政策同阿拉伯各国的利益是格格不入的。他写道，很早以前所有最权威的中东问题专家就已经知道，西方在这个地区的政策很明显地正在走向破产。在阿拉伯国家支持靠武力和财力维持的、使人民进一步贫困化的封建制度，这就意味自己使自己早晚受到人们的敌视，并且最后会遭到反对。
