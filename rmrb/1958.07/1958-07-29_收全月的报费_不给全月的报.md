    Consider the Readers More
    Collect the full month's fee
    But don't provide the full month's newspaper
    The newspaper distribution work at the Yakeshi Post Office in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, is very chaotic. We have raised objections to them several times, but no improvement has been seen. Our factory subscribed to the People's Daily, China Youth Daily, and Inner Mongolia Youth Daily for June, and paid the full month's fee. After more than ten inquiries, the People's Daily was finally delivered on June 13th, and the China Youth Daily was delivered on the 17th. The newspapers for the previous ten days and more were not delivered. We asked them if they would refund the newspaper fees for the first ten days and more, but we have not received a reply to this day. Later, our factory moved, and we notified the post office long ago to deliver the newspapers to the new address starting June 23rd. This transfer made things even worse; from the 23rd to the end of the month, we didn't see any newspapers. Thus, our factory spent a month's newspaper fee and only saw the newspapers for a little more than ten days in total. We can't help but ask: The whole nation is in the Great Leap Forward, why can't the newspaper distribution work of the Yakeshi Post Office also take a leap forward?

### 收全月的报费  不给全月的报

    多为读者着想
    收全月的报费
    不给全月的报
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟牙克石邮局的报刊发行工作很乱，好几次向他们提出意见，没见改进。我们厂里订的6月份人民日报、中国青年报和内蒙古青年报等，交了全月的报费，经过十多次催问，才在6月13日送来人民日报，17日送来中国青年报，这以前十多天的报纸都没有送来。我们问他们是否退还前十多天的报费，到现在还没有答复。后来我们工厂搬家，早就通知邮局从6月23日起把报纸送到新址，这一转就更糟了，从23日至月底就没有看到报纸。这样，我厂花了一个月的报费，总共才看了十多天的报纸。我们不禁要问：全民都在大跃进，牙克石邮局的报刊发行工作为什么就不能跃进呢？
