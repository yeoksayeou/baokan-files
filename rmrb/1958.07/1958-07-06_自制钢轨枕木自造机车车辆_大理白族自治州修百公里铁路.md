Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. The first railway built by minority ethnic groups themselves in our country has commenced construction.

This railway runs from Fengyi County in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, through Xiaguan, Dali, Dengchuan, Eryuan, and other counties and cities, to Heqing, with a total length of 105 kilometers. The steel, sleepers, locomotives, and freight cars needed to build this railway will all be resolved by the autonomous prefecture through self-reliance. The Party and government leading organs of the autonomous prefecture have already made a decision that the local state-owned Xiaguan General Machinery Factory, the Xiaguan Bamboo and Wood Farm Implement Factory, and the Xiaguan Transportation Main Station will be responsible for producing locomotives, freight cars, and sleepers. Yongjian, Yunlong, Heqing, Xiangyun, and other counties within the autonomous prefecture, which are rich in iron ore, will be responsible for supplying steel. All organs, schools, and people of all ethnic groups must do their best to support the construction of the railway with manpower and materials. In order to explore experience in building railways, it was decided to first trial construction of the 24-kilometer section from Fengyi to Xiaguan, which is planned to be open to traffic on National Day this year.

The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is located in the western part of the Yunnan Plateau. In the past, the transportation of materials within the prefecture mainly relied on mules and horses, and human backs and shoulders. Building railways and riding trains has been a long-held dream of the Bai people, but no one thought of realizing it with their own hands. Recently, news in the newspaper about the people of Yuxian County, Shanxi, building a railway on their own broke the mysterious perception of railway construction among the Bai and other ethnic groups in the prefecture, and they resolved to build a railway on their own. The autonomous prefecture has made a plan to build 500 kilometers of railways in the Second Five-Year Plan period, connecting the counties and major factories and mines within the prefecture, and linking up with the Kunming-Dali railway planned to be built by the state, becoming a part of the national railway network.

    大理白族自治州修百公里铁路
    新华社昆明讯　我国少数民族地区自己修筑的第一条铁路已经动工。
    这条铁路，从云南省大理白族自治州的凤仪县，经下关、大理、邓川、洱源等县、市到达鹤庆，全长一百零五公里。建筑这条铁路所需的钢铁、枕木、机车和车皮都由自治州自力更生来解决。自治州的党、政领导机关已经作出决定，由地方国营下关市通用机器厂、下关市竹木农具厂和下关运输总站等单位，负责生产机车、车皮和枕木；自治州内产铁丰富的永建、云龙、鹤庆、祥云等县负责供应钢铁；各机关、学校和各族居民，都要尽量以人力、物力支援铁路的修建。为了摸索修铁路的经验，决定先试修从凤仪到下关共长二十四公里的一段，计划在今年国庆节通车。
    大理白族自治州位于云南高原的西部，州内过去运输物资主要靠骡马和人背人挑，修铁路、乘火车是白族人民多年的梦想，但谁也没想到用自己的双手来实现。最近，报纸上刊登山西盂县人民自建铁路的消息，打破了白族及州内其它各族人民对修铁路的神秘观念，决心自办铁路。自治州已作出规划，要在第二个五年计划内修铁路五百公里，把州内各县和主要厂矿连接起来，并同计划由国家修筑的昆明—大理铁路相衔接，成为全国铁路网的一部分。
