    The Backbone of the Technological Revolution and the Cultural Revolution:
    Intellectuals Among Workers and Peasants in Shanxi are Growing

    (Our reporters Shui Tiansheng and Fan Yinhuai report) A new type of intellectual is growing among workers and peasants in Shanxi Province. Some of them have already become an important force in the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

    In the past few years, more than 1.4 million workers, peasants, and other laborers in various parts of Shanxi have shaken off illiteracy. They continue to learn culture and delve into science and technology in their production practices, becoming working-class intellectuals with both rich production experience and cultural and technical levels. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 400,000 peasants in the province with upper primary and junior high school education levels, and 900,000 peasants with primary school and literacy graduation levels. In the factories and mines of Taiyuan, Datong, and other five cities, more than 60,000 employees have become intellectuals with upper primary, junior high, and high school education levels, and some have entered amateur iron and steel, chemical, and mechanical engineering colleges and amateur red-and-expert universities to continue their studies.

    At present, the vast majority of middle and lower-level cadres in factories, mines, and rural areas throughout the province are newly grown worker-peasant intellectuals. Some of them serve as leading backbones at the factory, workshop, work section, and agricultural cooperative levels; some have become engineers, technicians, and agricultural cooperative technicians; and some have become technical innovation experts. In some factory and mining enterprises in Taiyuan, most of the deputy directors and technicians of workshop production have been promoted from workers in recent years. Wang Zhenhua, deputy director of production in the forging and riveting workshop of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, is a riveter with 19 years of work experience. He originally had only a junior primary school education. Because he insisted on learning culture and technology, he is now able to design, draw, and trial-produce some new products. In the technical innovation movement, he gathered the suggestions of all workshop employees for technological innovation and proposed a plan for the "ten majorizations" of production, such as the universalization of pneumatic hammer drills in his workshop. Now Wang Zhenhua leads engineering and technical personnel and workers to have realized "five-izations."

    The new type of worker intellectuals is full of the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, and is not bound by outdated conventions and bad habits. Whether in technical debates or in production, they dare to fight against backward and conservative phenomena. Bai Zunqian, an engineer from a worker's background at Shanxi Machine Factory, dared to be bold and original in technology and dared to put forward his own opinions. Once, when the factory was trial-producing a 50-horsepower winch, if it was produced according to the original drawings, the machine would be too large and labor-intensive. Bai Zunqian suggested reducing the size of the machine, but the relevant technicians thought it could not be changed. However, Bai Zunqian insisted on his opinion and personally modified and successfully produced a 50-horsepower winch with good quality, which saved a large number of metal materials.

    Many young and middle-aged peasants are studying agricultural science and technology in more than 7,000 spare-time cultural and technical schools. After graduating from the agricultural technical school, more than 260 people in Xunxi Zhangji Township, Jieyu County, entered the spare-time agricultural university to study ten professional knowledge of cotton and grain cultivation, pests and diseases, electromechanical, culture and art. Wang Yunsheng, the technical section chief of this township, originally had only upper primary school education. In recent years, he has read more than 100 kinds of agricultural technical books, and has experimented and promoted five new technologies suitable for the local area, such as close planting, improved varieties, pest control, and irrigation. He also experimented with and successfully promoted the method of spring irrigation of wheat in the township. Among the more than 1,000 literacy graduates in Gaoghe Township, Luan County, the vast majority participated in agricultural tool reform activities, manufacturing and reforming 59 agricultural tools and innovating 35 technologies. Li Tianzhen, the director of the Guangming Cooperative in this township, successfully trial-produced a land leveler using the principles of mechanical manufacturing. Using this machine to level the land is ten times more efficient than manual leveling.

    The newly grown worker-peasant intellectuals actively participate in cultural activities. They write poetry, paint, write plays and perform dramas, full of talent. Jing Xiuting, an old boiler worker at Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, was illiterate before liberation. After liberation, due to his diligent study and hard practice, he has become a cultural person who loves to sing and write. He often sings his own works singing the new life on Shanxi Radio. And he wrote more than 70 articles for Shanxi Daily and Taiyuan Daily. Recently, the "Shanxi Literature Special Edition" compiled by Wenyi Bao commented that "Grandma of Changyuan" is a good short story. The author of this short story, Han Wenzhou, is a young man from a peasant background. Originally, he only had a primary school education. In recent years, he has written many novels full of strong life atmosphere. Ji Cuisan of Jiuzhuang Township, Xiangyuan County, overcame the difficulties in writing, and in recent years wrote 33 scripts and drum lyrics, and more than 300 fast clappers, many of which were published in county and provincial newspapers. There are already 300,000 to 400,000 young intellectuals in the province who serve as teachers and little teachers in rural civil-run middle schools and spare-time cultural and technical schools.

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have always attached great importance to worker-peasant spare-time education. Factory and mining enterprises throughout the province have generally established employee spare-time cultural schools to conduct cultural and technical education for employees; some factory and mining enterprises have also established spare-time colleges. Relevant units organize employees to study through spare-time and full-time methods, and provide support in terms of funding and equipment. At present, 3 million workers and peasants in the province have participated in cultural and technical studies.

    技术革命和文化革命的骨干
    山西工农知识分子正在成长
    本报讯　记者水天生、范银怀报道：山西省工人农民中的新型知识分子正在成长。他们中有一部分人已经成为技术革命和文化革命的重要力量。
    几年来，山西各地已有一百四十多万工人农民和其他劳动者摆脱了文盲状态，他们在生产实践中继续学习文化，钻研科学技术，成为既有丰富的生产经验，又有文化技术水平的工人阶级的知识分子。据不完全统计，目前全省农村已有四十万农民具有高小和初中文化程度，有九十万农民具有初小程度和扫盲毕业水平；在太原、大同等五个城市的厂矿企业，又有六万多职工成为具有高小、初中、高中文化程度的知识分子，有的还进入业余钢铁、化工、机械高等学院和业余红专大学继续深造。
    目前，全省厂矿和农村的中层和基层干部中绝大部分是新成长起来的工农知识分子。他们有的担任厂级、车间、工段和农业社的领导骨干；有的成了工程师、技师和农业社的技术员；有些成为技术革新的能手。太原有些厂矿企业的车间生产副主任、技师，大部分是近年来从工人中提拔起来的。太原矿山机器厂锻铆车间生产副主任王振华是一个有十九年工龄的铆工。他原来只有初小文化程度，由于他坚持学习文化技术，现在已能设计、绘图和试制一些新产品。在技术革新运动中，他汇集了全车间职工革新技术的建议，提出本车间汽锤钻子万能化等生产十大化的革新方案。现在王振华领导工程技术人员和工人已经实现了“五化”。
    新型的工人知识分子富有敢想敢作的革命精神，不受陈规陋习的束缚。他们无论在技术辩论会上或生产中，都敢于和落后保守的现象进行斗争。山西机器厂工人出身的工程师白尊谦，在技术上敢于大胆独创，敢于提出自己的见解。有一次这个厂试制五十马力的卷扬机，如果按原图纸生产，机器体积太大，费工费料。白尊谦提出改小机器体积的意见，有关技术人员都认为不能改。但白尊谦坚持了自己的意见，并亲自动手改制成功五十马力的卷扬机，质量很好，并节约了大批金属材料。
    许多青壮年农民在七千多所业余文化技术学校里，学习着农业科学技术。解虞县纁西张羁乡有二百六十余人在农业技术学校毕业后进入业余农业大学，分别学习棉粮栽培、病虫害、机电、文化艺术等十种专业知识。这个乡的技术股长王运升原来仅有高小文化程度，近年来他阅读了一百多种农业技术书籍，并且试验推广了适合当地的密植、改良品种、治虫、灌溉等五种新技术，并且试验成了春浇小麦的方法，在全乡推广。潞安县高河乡扫盲毕业的一千多个学员中，绝大多数参加了农具改革活动，制造和改造农具五十九件，革新技术三十五项。这个乡的光明社社主任李天珍运用机械制造原理试制成功了一种平地器，用这种机器平地比人工平地提高效率十倍。
    新成长起来的工农知识分子积极参加文化活动。他们写诗，绘画，编剧演戏，才华横溢。太原矿山机器厂老锅炉工景秀亭，解放前不识字。解放后，由于他勤学苦练，已成为一个爱唱、爱写的文化人。他经常在山西广播电台说唱自己编写的歌唱新生活的作品。并且在山西日报、太原日报写了七十多篇稿子。最近，文艺报编的“山西文艺特辑”中评论“长院奶奶”是一篇好的短篇小说，这篇小说的作者韩文洲，是一个农民出身的青年。原先他只有小学文化程度，几年来他写出了不少充满浓厚生活气息的小说。襄垣县九庄乡冀榱三克服了写作上的困难，几年来写出了三十三个剧本、鼓词，三百多个快板，其中有许多发表在县和省的报纸上。全省已有三、四十万个青年知识分子担任了农村民办中学和业余文化技术学校的教师和小先生。
    中共山西省委和省人民委员会一直十分重视工农业余教育工作。全省各地厂矿普遍举办了职工业余文化学校，向职工进行文化技术教育；有些厂矿还设立了业余高等学院。各有关单位通过业余、脱产的方式组织职工学习，并给予经费、设备上的支持。目前，全省已有三百万工人农民参加了文化技术学习。
