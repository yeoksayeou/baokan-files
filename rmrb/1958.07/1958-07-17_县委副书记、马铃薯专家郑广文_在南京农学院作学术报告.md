Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th - Zheng Guangwen, Deputy Secretary of the Jieshou County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Anhui Province and a potato expert, was invited by Nanjing Agricultural College to deliver three academic reports to the faculty and students of the entire college on the 9th and 10th, which were warmly received.

Zheng Guangwen is originally from Shanxi Province and comes from a farming family, growing potatoes from a young age. In 1955, the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committees requested Jieshou County to become a potato seed breeding base, and the County Party Committee entrusted him with this task. After receiving the important task from the Party, he devoted himself to studying, learning from farmers on the one hand, and planting experimental fields with members of the County Party Committee on the other. Through several years of comparative experiments and scientific analysis, he deeply recognized the characteristics of the "Jieshou Red Skin" potato variety, summarized a complete set of cultivation experience, and had creative insights into solving the problem of potato seed degeneration in the South and the problem of planting in spring and autumn. He has made great contributions academically and in guiding current potato production.

In his report, Zheng Guangwen analyzed in detail the eight major characteristics of the "Jieshou Red Skin" potato variety.

The faculty and students of Nanjing Agricultural College believe that Zheng Guangwen's report has high academic value, is a report that is both red and expert, and affirms the experience created by the farmers of Jieshou.
