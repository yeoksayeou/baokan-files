    Suspended Rice Combine Harvester

    In order to vigorously support agricultural production, the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Repair and Assembly Plant and the Jiangxi Provincial Farm Implement Research Office, after twenty days and nights of hard work, successfully trial-produced a suspended rice combine harvester. After being appraised by the Jiangxi Provincial Farm Implement Research Office, its performance was good and achieved the expected results.

    The chassis and running gear of the suspended rice combine harvester is a universal wheeled tractor, which has the flexibility to adapt to paddy fields and the off-road performance to overcome obstacles. It is suspended on the tractor, and can achieve multiple uses of the tractor according to the needs of the agricultural season, increase the tractor's operating items, and improve the mechanical utilization rate.

    The suspended rice combine harvester is divided into three parts: shearing, threshing, and cleaning. The three tasks are carried out simultaneously during harvesting. Each person can harvest 60 to 70 mu of rice per day (calculated as ten hours), which is equivalent to the workload of 120 to 140 full laborers.

    悬挂式水稻联合收割机
    江西省农业机械修配厂和江西省农具研究室，为了大力支援农业生产，经过二十昼夜的苦战，试制成功一台悬挂式水稻联合收割机，经江西省农具研究室鉴定，性能良好，达到预期效果。
    悬挂式水稻联合收割机的底盘和行走部分是一台万能型轮式拖拉机，有适应水田使用的灵活性和超越障阻的越野性能；它是悬挂在拖拉机上，可根据农时季节的需要，达到拖拉机的多元利用，增加拖拉机作业项目，提高机械利用率。
    悬挂式水稻联合收割机共分剪割、脱谷、清选三个部分，收割时三项工作同时进行，每人每天（以十小时计算）可收割水稻六十到七十亩，相当于一百二十至一百四十个全劳动力的工作量。
