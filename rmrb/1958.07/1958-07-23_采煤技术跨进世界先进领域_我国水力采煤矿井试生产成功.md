Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 22nd: China's first hydraulic coal mining mine successfully entered trial production on the 19th at the Tangjiazhuang Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine. This marks that China's coal industry's coal mining technology has stepped into the field of the world's advanced scientific and technological coal mining.

On the afternoon of the 19th, after the industrial trial production dispatch order was issued to the work surface, a powerful high-pressure water flow sprayed from the nozzle of the water gun, piercing the hard coal wall like a sharp arrow, erupting with a thunderous roar. Large pieces of coal, broken and subsided by the impact of the water flow, poured into the long coal conveying trough like a torrent of black rapids. This coal was continuously pumped from 300 meters below the deep well to the ground through pipelines by two high-pressure coal-water pumps connected in series. In just twenty minutes of trial production, more than fifteen tons of raw coal were sprayed from the pipe mouth. All mechanical and electrical equipment operated well.

Hydraulic coal mining is the latest technology in the world's coal mining that has only emerged in the Soviet Union in recent years. Water has always been a major enemy in coal mine production. Groundwater can seep into the work surface and flood the mine's passages. Therefore, water must be pumped continuously to maintain production. However, in hydraulic coal mining mines, water becomes a good assistant for miners' production. Using hydraulic coal mining, labor productivity is not only higher than that of mechanized mines, but it is also safer, with no dust or fumes, and the working conditions are much better. According to calculations, the investment per ton of coal in this hydraulic coal mining mine with a daily output of more than 700 tons is only 15 yuan, which is nearly half less than that of ordinary mines. Moreover, after being put into production, the entire production process only requires 34 people, while a general mechanized coal mine with the same output requires more than 300 people.

This mine was designed by the engineering and technical personnel of the Tangshan Coal Mine Scientific Research Institute and Kailuan Coal Mine, who studied Soviet materials themselves.

### 采煤技术跨进世界先进领域  我国水力采煤矿井试生产成功

    采煤技术跨进世界先进领域
    我国水力采煤矿井试生产成功
    新华社天津22日电  我国第一个水力采煤矿井，19日已在开滦煤矿唐家庄矿试验生产成功，它标志着我国煤炭工业的采煤技术已跨进了世界采煤先进科学技术的领域。
    19日下午，当进行工业试验的调度命令下达到工作面以后，一股强大的高压水流从水枪喷口喷射出来，像利箭似的穿入坚硬的煤壁，爆发出春雷般的吼声。被水流冲击破碎下沉的大片煤炭好像一条奔腾的黑色激流，倾泻入长长的输煤煤槽中。这些煤炭由两台串连的高压煤水泵从三百公尺深井下面，通过管路源源不断压送到地面。试验生产仅二十分钟，管口就喷出原煤十五吨多。全部机电设备运转良好。
    水力采煤是苏联最近几年才出现的世界采煤的最新技术。水一直是煤矿生产中的大敌，地下水会渗透到工作面上来，把矿井的通道淹没。因而必须不间断地抽水才能维持生产。而在水力采煤的矿井，水却变成矿工生产的好助手。利用水力采煤，劳动生产率不仅比机械化矿井高，而且安全，没有灰尘和烟气，劳动条件优越得多。据计算，这个日产七百多吨的水力采煤矿井，每吨煤的投资只合十五元，比一般矿井减少近一半。并且投入生产后整个生产过程只需要三十四人，而产量与此相等的一般机械化煤井，则需要三百多个人。
    这个矿井是唐山煤矿科学研究院和开滦煤矿的工程技术人员学习苏联的资料自己进行设计的。
