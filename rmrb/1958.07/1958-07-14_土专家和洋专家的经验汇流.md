In the technical revolution, "native experts" in all walks of life are constantly emerging. These home-grown experts have attracted the attention of the scientific community. Recently, agricultural experts from eight provinces and cities, including Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi, were invited by the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies and the Beijing Federation of Scientific Societies to come to Beijing to discuss issues with agricultural scientists. They visited crop growth in scientific laboratories and experimental fields, and jointly studied problems. They also challenged each other to compare per-mu yields in experimental fields in the future, launching a socialist competition. This shows that the two forces of the technical revolution—"native experts" and "foreign experts," manual laborers and mental laborers, laboring people with practical production experience and intellectuals with book knowledge—are converging.

Science is the result of people inheriting the production practice experience of previous generations, analyzing and researching it. Science comes from the production practice of the broad masses of the people. Science should also directly or indirectly serve production practice and guide production practice. The improvement of scientific level must depend on production practice. Its law is: practice, improve; re-practice, re-improve, and constantly move forward. Our goal is the continuous improvement of productivity and the continuous improvement of the scientific level. We hope to eliminate the difference between mental labor and manual labor. However, the current social conditions cannot temporarily eliminate the difference between mental labor and manual labor. Therefore, the current solution should be a combination of "native" and "foreign," cooperation between "native" and "foreign," and a confluence of "native" and "foreign."

Some scientific workers believe that now that we are engaged in the technical revolution, the contributions of "native experts" are increasing, and people everywhere can be heard praising "native experts." Does this mean that "foreign experts" who have received formal higher education are no longer important, or even needed? We believe that the technical revolution cannot do without Chinese and foreign knowledge. Especially when we are carrying out the technical revolution, people feel that we don't have too many "foreign experts," but too few. The knowledge of "foreign experts" is also not too much, but too little, especially the practical knowledge of "foreign experts." What people require of "foreign experts" is to work in a down-to-earth manner, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and serve production. Our country's "foreign experts" have too little contact with production practice and the masses. They value book knowledge too much and are accustomed to locking themselves in small laboratories. In the activities of "native-foreign" confluence, they began to be shocked. Many of them began to eliminate their doubts about "native experts" and saw with their own eyes the objective fact that wheat yields thousands of catties per mu. This is not because the ruler for measuring mu is larger, or the scale for weighing wheat grains is smaller, but a huge leap in production. Many of the experiences talked about by production experts cannot be found in thick, finely bound books from China and abroad. This is the world's most advanced level in production. Analyzing and researching its laws from this production method is the world's most advanced level in science. Learning from the experiences of "native experts" and summarizing and improving their experiences is the undeniable responsibility of "foreign experts." The experiments conducted by "foreign experts" based on the "most advanced scientific theories" yield only a few hundred catties per mu; farmers do not understand the "most advanced scientific theories," but the result of the experiment is a yield of several thousand catties per mu. This is worthy of people's deep thought. No wonder many "foreign experts" said after listening to the experience reports of "native experts": "We have received a vivid education in being both Red and expert"; "Our minds have been liberated." They said that they would further go to the field to learn and summarize the experiences of "native experts," and they confidently raised the yield targets of their experimental fields. "Native experts" have inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of "foreign experts," which is a good thing. This is an important gain from the "native-foreign" confluence.

In the history of human cultural development, the pioneers of technical revolutions in any period have been the laboring people in production practice. They are the main force of the technical revolution. The exploiting classes of all dynasties have slandered the laboring people as the most lowly, but we must say: the lowly are the most intelligent! Because this is the truth. The high-yield wheat fields of more than 7,000 catties per mu created by Chinese farmers have shocked the whole country and the whole world. This is the mainstream in the torrent of the technical revolution. Anyone who does not believe it does not believe in the masses, and does not believe in the wisdom of hundreds of millions of laboring people.

The book knowledge of "native experts" is indeed not much. Because of their love for socialism, they have achieved success through hard work under the superior socialist system; their experience is still not systematic or complete. Through the "native-foreign" confluence activities, after visiting and discussing issues at scientific research institutions, "native experts" filled their notebooks with densely packed notes. They recorded the names and usage methods of many new fertilizers, and recorded the names and prevention methods of many pests that they had never heard of before. Some of the questions they raised were answered by "foreign experts." They planned to return to their agricultural cooperatives and report to the members the new things they saw in the scientists' laboratories. They planned to put the "antibiotic bacteria" brought from Beijing Agricultural University into the soil in Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi and other places to see what role it could play in production. They also said: "Our minds have been further liberated!" They proposed that wheat should achieve high yields on a large area of hundreds or thousands of mu; they proposed that the per-mu yield target of experimental fields should no longer be several thousand catties, but tens of thousands of catties. They are very confident. The reason is that they have a greater understanding of the laws of nature. They hope and believe that they will receive more support from "foreign experts" in the future.

The central issue discussed by "native experts" and "foreign experts" at this meeting was how to promote the experience of yielding several thousand catties of wheat per mu on a large area of land, and to promote it in more wheat-producing areas, and how to experiment with higher per-mu yields. Now the national average wheat yield per mu is about 180 catties. With the joint efforts of "native" and "foreign" experts, China's wheat production will continue to increase, and the happy life of the Chinese people will also increase with the increase in production. These are also issues related to the level of world agricultural science. Now our wheat yield of several thousand catties per mu is the highest level of wheat production in the world. If we can find out the scientific laws in it, it will be of great significance to the development of world agricultural science.

In this "native-foreign" confluence activity, "native" and "foreign" experts launched a competition, and the per-mu yield targets of their experimental fields were increased again and again. Their common feeling is that "production has no limit." The view that production has no limit is in line with the law of development of things. There are many ways to develop productivity and continuously increase crop yields; there are many "native" methods, many "foreign" methods, and even more "native-foreign" combined methods. Where the limit is, it is always unknown. The situation is pressing. Things are no longer developing according to people's original experience, nor are they developing according to the laws in books, but leaping and leaping forward again. The situation forces our thinking to be further liberated. "Native experts" are daydreaming, and "foreign experts" are also daydreaming; "native" and "foreign" are intertwined, complementing each other. Those who are in the "settle accounts after autumn" faction or the "settle accounts next year" faction cannot but admit defeat. Next year's new victory will give the "settle accounts after autumn" faction and the "settle accounts next year" faction a new and heavier blow.

This conference on the exchange of experience between "native" and "foreign" experts was a successful conference. At the meeting, both "native" and "foreign" experts were full of confidence and prepared to move towards higher per-mu yield targets. This kind of conference is worth greatly promoting. This is one of the good forms of combining knowledge and production practice at present. This approach will greatly contribute to the re-leap in production and the re-leap in scientific research work.

### 土专家和洋专家的经验汇流

    土专家和洋专家的经验汇流
    在技术革命中，各行各业的土专家不断地涌现出来。这些土生土长的专家引起了科学界的重视。最近河南、湖北、浙江、江苏、陕西等八个省市的农业丰产能手们应全国科联和北京科联的邀请，到北京同农业科学工作者们一起座谈，在科学实验室里、在试验田里互相参观作物生长的情况，一起研究问题。他们还互相挑战比今后试验田的亩产量，展开社会主义的竞赛。这表明，土专家和洋专家、体力劳动者和脑力劳动者、有生产实际经验的劳动人民和有书本知识的知识分子，两股技术革命的力量正在汇流。
    科学是人们继承前代生产实践经验，经过分析研究所得的成果。科学来自广大人民群众的生产实践。科学又应当直接或间接地为生产实践服务，指导生产实践。科学水平的提高必须依赖生产实践。它的规律是：实践、提高；再实践、再提高，不断地前进。我们的奋斗目标，是生产力的不断提高、科学水平的不断提高。我们希望消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。但是现在的社会条件暂时还不能消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，因此，当前的办法应当是土洋结合，土洋协作，土洋汇流。
    有的科学工作者认为，现在搞技术革命了，土专家的贡献愈来愈多，到处都可以听到人们对土专家的赞扬，这是不是说受过正规高等教育的洋专家不重要了，甚至不需要了？我们认为，技术革命离不了中外知识。特别是当我们进行技术革命的时候，人们感觉到，我们的洋专家不是太多，而是太少了。洋专家们的知识也不是太多，而是太少了，特别是洋专家的实际知识更是太少了。人们要求洋专家的是踏踏实实的干，深入实际、深入群众，为生产服务。我国的洋专家们对生产实际和对群众的接触都太少了，他们过多地看重了书本知识，习惯于把自己关在小小的实验室里。在土洋汇流的活动中，他们开始受到了震动。他们中的许多人开始消除了对土专家的怀疑，亲眼看到了小麦亩产几千斤的客观事实，这并不是丈量亩数的尺子大了，或称麦粒的秤小了，而是生产的巨大跃进。生产能手们所谈的经验中，有许多东西翻遍中外大厚本的精装书，都找不到根据。这是生产上的世界最先进水平。从这种生产方法中分析研究出它的规律来，这就是科学上的世界最先进水平。学习土专家们的经验，总结、提高他们的经验，是洋专家们无可旁贷的责任。洋专家们根据“最先进的科学理论”进行的试验，亩产只有几百斤；农民不懂“最先进的科学理论”，而试验的结果却是亩产几千斤。这是值得人们深思的。无怪许多洋专家听了土专家的经验报告以后，感叹地说：“我们受了生动的红与专的教育”；“我们的思想解放了”。他们表示，要进一步到现场去学习、总结土专家的经验，他们满怀信心地把自己的试验田的产量指标提高起来。土专家鼓舞了洋专家的革命干劲，这是好事。这是土洋汇流的重要收获。
    人类文化发展的历史上，任何时期的技术革命的先行者，都是生产实践中的劳动人民。他们是技术革命的主力。历代的剥削阶级污蔑劳动人民最卑贱，可是我们要说：卑贱者最聪明！因为这是真理。中国农民创造的小麦亩产七千多斤的高额丰产田，震动了全国，震动了全世界。这是技术革命洪流中的主流。谁要不相信它，就是不相信群众，不相信几亿劳动人民的智慧。
    土专家们的书本知识确实是不多，他们由于热爱社会主义，在优越的社会主义制度下，刻苦奋斗得到了成就；他们的经验还不系统、不完整。通过土洋汇流的活动，土专家们到科学研究机关参观、座谈以后，他们的小笔记本上记得密密麻麻的，他们记下了许多新肥料的名称和使用法，记下了许多从来没有听到过的害虫的名称和防治法。他们提出的问题，有些从洋专家那里得到了解答。他们准备回到自己的农业社以后，向社员们报告从科学家的实验室里看到的新鲜事。他们准备把从北京农业大学带去的“抗生菌”放到湖北、河南、江苏、浙江、陕西等地的土地上去试一试，看它对生产能起什么作用。他们也说：“我们的思想又进一步解放了！”他们提出，小麦应当在百亩、千亩的土地上大面积丰产；他们提出试验田的亩产指标应该不再是几千斤，而是几万斤。他们的信心很足。原因是他们更多地认识了大自然的规律。他们希望、也相信今后将得到洋专家们的更多的支援。
    土专家和洋专家们在这次会面中谈论的中心问题是如何让亩产几千斤小麦的经验在大面积土地上推广，在更多的产麦区推广，如何试验更高的亩产量。现在全国小麦平均亩产量是一百八十斤左右。在土洋专家们的共同努力下我国的小麦产量将会不断提高，我国人民的幸福生活也将随着产量的提高而增长。这些也是关系世界农业科学的水平问题。现在我们小麦亩产几千斤，是世界小麦生产的最高水平，如果把其中的科学规律找出来，那对于世界农业科学的发展将有重大意义。
    在这次土洋汇流的活动中，土洋专家们开展了竞赛，他们的试验田的亩产量指标一加再加。他们共同的感觉是“生产没有顶”。生产没有顶的看法，是合乎事物发展的规律的。发展生产力、使农作物不断增产的道路多得很；土办法多，洋办法多，土洋结合办法就更多。顶在那里，永远是未知数。形势逼人。事情不再按照人们原有的经验发展，也不再按照书本上的定律发展，而是飞跃再飞跃地发展。形势逼使我们的思想要解放再解放。土专家在异想天开，洋专家也在异想天开；土洋交织，相得益彰。什么“秋后算账派”或“明年算账派”都不能不认输了。明年的新胜利，将给“秋后算账派”和“明年算账派”以新的更沉重的打击。
    这次土洋专家经验交流的会，是个成功的会。会上土洋专家都信心百倍，准备着向更高的亩产指标前进。这种会值得大大提倡，这是当前知识和生产实际相结合的好形式之一。这种作法，将大大有助于生产的再跃进和科学研究工作的再跃进。
