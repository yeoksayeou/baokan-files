In recent days, eight million people in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province have participated in protest demonstrations against the American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. This movement is now developing deeply into remote mountainous areas. The Qinling Mountains, the Bashan Mountains, and the Loess Plateau of Northern Shaanxi are filled with angry crowds shouting the slogans "Yankee and British aggressors get out of the Middle East" and "American aggressors get out of Taiwan."
    In more than twenty mountainous counties such as Yan'an, Suide, Chunhua, and Changwu, as well as in more than five thousand agricultural cooperatives in these areas, rallies of hundreds to thousands of people have been held in recent days to denounce the aggressors.
