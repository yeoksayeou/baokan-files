Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The literacy campaign among coal mine system workers has seen rapid progress in recent months. After several months of hard work, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in the Harbin area has reached 86.69% non-illiteracy among its young and middle-aged workers; the Hegang Coal Mine has reached 85.82% non-illiteracy among its young and middle-aged workers, basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers.

According to a survey in March of this year, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Henan Province still had 3,170 illiterate young and middle-aged workers; by May, 2,414 had been made literate, accounting for 76%, a number exceeding the total number of people made literate during the entire First Five-Year Plan period; among them, the Lifeng Mine is basically free of illiteracy. Shanxi Province's coal mine system's literacy campaign has historically been poor, but this year it has leaped to a leading position, with more than 90% of illiterate people enrolled in school. The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau became an illiteracy-free mine before "July 1st." In addition, the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan and the Fangzi Coal Mine in Shandong have also basically eliminated illiteracy among their young and middle-aged workers. Of the thirteen units in the Pingdingshan Coal Mine in Henan, eleven have eliminated illiteracy.

In order to complete the literacy task as soon as possible, various coal mine units have taken many specific measures. For example, six teachers from the Fenxi Coal Mine signed contracts with thirty-five coal miners, cooks, boilermen, and tea furnace workers, adopting the method of regularly delivering literacy lessons to their doorsteps, and will be able to eliminate illiteracy within the year. Many other units have put forward the slogan: "Decentralized contracting for teaching and learning, leaders taking the lead in guaranteeing, the masses of teachers taking on the majority, cadres and workers launching an all-out offensive," launching a mass movement of contracted teaching and learning. This has greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for learning. Tian Jiucheng, an old worker from the Jiaozuo Lifeng Mine, said with emotion: "Live and learn, never wear the illiteracy hat, determined to learn from the old Liang Hao." With the rising enthusiasm for learning, workers' literary and artistic creations have also sprung up in large numbers. Many mines have compiled these novel, moving, and production-related literary and artistic creations into literacy teaching materials, which are extremely popular with workers. After learning this knowledge, workers write it down on paper, remember it in their hearts, and recite it loudly anytime, anywhere, which not only enhances their memory but also serves as a propaganda tool, bringing many benefits to promoting production.

    包教保学订合同  快速前进除文盲
    广大煤矿职工识字知书
    新华社8日讯  煤矿系统职工扫除文盲运动几个月来出现了快速前进的局面。哈尔滨地区的双鸭山煤矿经过几个月的苦战，青壮年职工中非文盲已达86.69％；鹤岗煤矿青壮年职工中非文盲已达85.82％，都基本上扫除了青壮年职工中的文盲。
    河南焦作煤矿据今年3月调查，青壮年职工中文盲还有三千一百七十人；到5月份就扫除了二千四百一十四人，占76％，这个数字超过了第一个五年计划期间扫除文盲人数的总和；其中李封矿已经基本没有文盲。山西省煤矿系统的扫盲运动历年来开展较差，而今年却跃为领先地位，文盲入学人数已达90％以上。太原西山矿务局已在“七一”前成为无文盲矿。另外河南宜洛煤矿、山东坊子煤矿也都已基本上扫除了青壮年职工中的文盲。河南平顶山煤矿十三个单位中，已有十一个单位扫除了文盲。
    各个煤矿单位为争取尽快地完成扫盲任务，采取了许多具体措施。如汾西煤矿六名教师与三十五名采煤工、炊事员、锅炉工、茶炉工订合同，采用定期送字上门的办法，年内就可以扫除文盲。还有许多单位提出：“分散包教订合同，领导带头作保证，群众教师包大半，干部职工打冲锋”的口号，展开了群众性的包教保学运动。这样就大大鼓舞了工人的学习情绪。焦作李封矿老工人田九成感动地说：“活到老，学到老，坚决不戴文盲帽，决心学习老梁灏”。在学习情绪日益高涨的情况下，工人文艺创作也随之大量涌现。许多矿把这些内容新颖、情节动人、结合生产的文艺创作又编成扫盲教材，极受工人欢迎。工人学习这些知识以后，写在纸上，记在心上，随时随地高声背诵，不仅增强了记忆，而且起了宣传员的作用，对于促进生产也带来很多好处。
