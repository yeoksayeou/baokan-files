Xinhua News Agency, Kuala Lumpur, July 8th: According to official statistics, Malaya's tin exports for the first half of this year reached the lowest record for the same period in the past ten years. Malaya only exported 25,970 tons of tin in the first half of this year, a decrease of 28.3% compared with 36,210 tons in the same period last year. The export volume in June was only 2,997 tons, the month with the least tin export this year, a decrease of more than half compared with June last year.

Since the implementation of the International Tin Council's decision to reduce the export volume of tin producing countries, the tin industry in Malaya has been in a serious recession since December last year. As of the end of May this year, 314 tin mines have been closed and 9,800 miners have lost their jobs. Due to the deepening of the economic crisis in the capitalist world, there is no sign of easing in the tin industry crisis.

    马来亚上半年锡输出量
    降到十年来最低纪录
    新华社8日讯  吉隆坡消息：根据官方统计数字，马来亚今年上半年的锡输出量达到了十年来同一期间锡输出量的最低纪录。马来亚今年上半年只输出锡二万五千九百七十吨，比去年同期的三万六千二百一十吨减少了28.3％。6月份的输出量只有二千九百九十七吨，是今年输出锡最少的一个月，比去年6月份减少了一半以上。
    马来亚锡业由于执行国际锡业理事会减少锡产国输出量的决定，从去年12月起便一直陷入严重的不景气，到今年5月底为止，已经有三百一十四个锡矿场关闭、九千八百名矿工失业。由于资本主义世界经济危机的加深，目前锡业的危机还没有缓和的迹象。
