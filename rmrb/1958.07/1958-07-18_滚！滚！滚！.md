    Get Out! Get Out! Get Out!
    Yuan Shuipai
    Winds and clouds rise on the Mediterranean coast,
    Suffering nations turn themselves over,
    This one raises a fist to drive away the robbers,
    That one takes action to behead the tyrant.
    Imperialism is alarmed,
    Its evil claws reach into Lebanon,
    Accustomed to stealing oil and drinking blood,
    Unwilling to let the people reverse the universe.
    Hey! What kind of era is this?!
    You are blind if you can't recognize:
    The people of the East have awakened,
    Colonial masters will have no descendants.
    The Yellow River and the Nile surge,
    Washing away plagues and villains,
    The nineteen hundred million people of Asia and Africa,
    Shout to control their own destiny!
    The Arab nation has a long history and culture,
    The ancient kingdom of Babylon three thousand years ago.
    When American youngsters were still nowhere to be seen,
    Civilization already existed in Mesopotamia.
    Ancient trees sprout and the earth returns to spring,
    The power of the people is like atomic energy,
    Splitting mountains will make them fall, trampling the ground will make it collapse.
    Get Out! Get Out! Get Out!
    American invading army!
    Get out of Lebanon!
    The Arab people are never isolated,
    The people of the world are their backing!

    滚！滚！滚！
    袁水拍
    地中海边起风云，
    受苦的国家闹翻身，
    这个挥拳赶强盗，
    那个动手斩暴君。
    帝国主义着了慌，
    魔爪伸到黎巴嫩，
    偷惯石油喝惯血，
    不甘心人民旋转乾坤。
    嘿！这是个什么时代？！
    你枉长眼珠认不清：
    东方人民觉醒了，
    殖民地老爷要断子绝孙。
    黄河、尼罗河浪滔滔，
    冲走了瘟神和恶棍，
    亚非人民十九亿，
    高呼要掌握自己命运！
    阿拉伯民族文化悠久，
    三千年前古国巴比伦。
    美国小子还无影踪，
    两河流域就有了文明。
    古树发芽大地回春，
    人民的力量像原子能，
    劈山山会倒，踏地地要崩。
    滚！滚！滚！
    美国侵略军！
    滚出黎巴嫩！
    阿拉伯人民决不孤立，
    世界人民作后盾！
