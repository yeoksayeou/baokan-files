Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 27th. The US imperialism's instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan Strait region has aroused great anger among the people of Fujian Province on the frontline of coastal defense. In recent days, villages, factories, schools, government offices, and shops throughout the province have held meetings to condemn the US-Chiang conspiracy. Everywhere, the slogans "US imperialism is not allowed to occupy our territory of Taiwan! The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not allowed to act as an accomplice! We must liberate Taiwan!" resounded.

Workers at the Fuzhou Universal Machinery Factory warned US imperialism at a meeting that US imperialism's instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan Strait region, attempting to "make trouble" in the face of the increasingly powerful Chinese people, is "courting death." They expressed their determination to intensify steel production, guarantee to have steel when steel is needed, and have people when people are needed, to completely crush the enemy's conspiracy. Chen Fuhui, a famous labor model and machine worker in Fujian, said: We are engaged in tense peaceful construction, but US imperialism is launching war provocations everywhere. Our working class must overfulfill the production tasks of steelmaking and steelmaking equipment to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Young workers in many factories in various regions have proposed to step up production to support the front lines, and if the motherland needs it, they will immediately take up arms and go to the battlefield to defend the motherland.

Farmers in various parts of Fujian also firmly protested against the US imperialism's instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan region. They guaranteed to overfulfill the annual production increase tasks, to "have grain when grain is needed," to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Farmers in Gushan Township on the outskirts of Fuzhou held a meeting in the fields yesterday to denounce the Chiang Kai-shek clique's attempt to take advantage of the situation. Commune member Wang Muhua said: Wherever the enemy climbs up, we will eliminate him there.

Ye Qingyue, a Taiwanese youth who defected to the mainland from Jinmen in 1956, angrily condemned US imperialism for occupying our Taiwan, saying that when he was in Taiwan, he personally saw that the people of Taiwan hated US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to the core, and everyone wanted to get out of the sea of misery and be liberated as soon as possible. Now that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is trying to take advantage of the situation, the Taiwanese youth are absolutely unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek. He expressed his willingness to contribute all his strength to the early liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, July 27th. Militiamen and demobilized soldiers on Xiamen Island on the Fujian front have held meetings in recent days to condemn the US and British imperialism's aggression in the Middle East, determined to hold a gun in one hand to defend the coast and hold a hoe/tool in the other to do a good job in production, to support the just struggle of the people of the Middle East, and to be ready at any time to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan.

More than 30 militiamen and demobilized soldiers in He厝乡, who had made meritorious services in the struggle against the enemy, recently held a meeting to denounce the US and British aggressors for threatening peace and instructing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan region. Cai Qingqi, the militia platoon leader, said: We resolutely oppose the US and British imperialism breaking into other countries' doors like mad dogs, and demand that these two mad dogs immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan. Huang Bishu and Chen Yajiu, demobilized soldiers who fought against the US aggressors in the Korean War and workers at the Xiamen Cod Liver Oil Factory, said: If US imperialism still does not accept the lessons of its failure in the Korean War and launches a war, we will pick up our guns again to attack the enemy and defend world peace.

Militiamen and demobilized soldiers from various units expressed at the meeting that the US imperialism, at the instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is constantly carrying out harassment and sabotage activities along the coast of Fujian. We must do everything possible to support the front lines and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
