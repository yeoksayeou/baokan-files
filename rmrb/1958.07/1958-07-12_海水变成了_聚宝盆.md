After our country's aquatic product departments defeated the conservative thought of focusing on fishing and embraced the idea of primarily focusing on aquaculture in developing the aquatic product industry, marine aquaculture is developing rapidly.

According to information from the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the marine aquaculture area this year has expanded by about double the 940,000 mu of last year, and the estimated output is 350,000 tons, an increase of nearly three times compared to last year's output.

This year, the aquatic product departments broke with past superstitions and outdated rules, boldly moving shellfish that grow in the south to the northern coast for cultivation, and moving kelp, sea cucumbers, abalone, etc. from the north to the south for cultivation. Mussels (dried mussels), which could only be cultivated in Guangdong in the past, are now found all along the coast of the country. Therefore, coastal fishermen love the sea and call it an inexhaustible and inexhaustible treasure bowl.

At present, the main artificial aquaculture in our country is razor clams, cockles, clams, oysters, and various fish, shrimp, and seaweed. In order to expand the variety of aquaculture, the Ministry of Aquatic Products has newly built more than a dozen state-owned aquaculture farms this year to experiment with the cultivation of valuable species with high economic value and rich nutrition, such as sea cucumbers, pearl oysters, seahorses, sea hares, and laver, in preparation for large-scale development of aquaculture in the future.

In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production, coastal provinces are conducting marine resource surveys and formulating aquaculture plans in order to make good use of seawater to produce wealth. Various places have great enthusiasm for developing marine aquaculture. Xiamen City has proposed that by 1962, it will achieve "mussels all over the ocean, oysters filling the sea, fish and shrimp filling the ponds, and shallow sea areas becoming seaweed forests."

Our country's coastline has excellent conditions for aquaculture: a 12,000-kilometer coastline with 15 million mu of sea surface suitable for aquaculture, of which only one-tenth is utilized. There are also more than 100 species that can be cultivated. These marine products are all favorite non-staple foods of our people, and many things are also valuable raw materials for the industrial and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries.

### 海水变成了“聚宝盆”

    海水变成了“聚宝盆”
    我国水产部门在以养为主发展水产事业的思想战胜了保守的以捕捞为主的思想后，海水养殖正在迅速发展。
    从水产部获悉，今年海水养殖面积已比去年的九十四万亩扩大了一倍左右，估计产量有三十五万吨，比去年的产量增加近三倍。
    今年水产部门打破了过去的迷信思想和清规戒律，大胆地把生长在南方的贝类移到北方沿海养殖，北方的海带、海参、鲍鱼等移到南方养殖。过去仅能在广东养殖的贻贝（淡菜）现在遍及全国沿海。因此，沿海渔民都热爱海水，称它为取之不尽，用之不竭的聚宝盆。
    我国目前人工养殖的主要是蛏蚶、蛤、牡蛎和各种鱼虾、海藻，为了扩大养殖品种，今年水产部又新建了十几个国营养殖场，试验养殖经济价值较大、营养丰富的海蔘、珍珠贝、海马、海兔、紫菜等珍贵品种，为今后大规模发展养殖做准备。
    在生产大跃进高潮中，沿海各省为了很好地利用海水生产财富，正在进行海水资源调查和制定养殖规划。各地发展海水养殖的劲头很大，厦门市提出了到1962年要做到“贻贝遍洋、牡蛎满海、鱼虾满塘、浅海藻林化”。
    我国沿海有优越的养殖条件：一万二千公里长的海岸线，有一千五百万亩适于养殖的海面，而利用的只有十分之一。能养殖的品种也有一百多种。这些海产都是我国人民喜爱的副食品，许多东西还是工业、医药制造业的贵重原料。
