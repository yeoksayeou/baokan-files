    Oxford University Students Leak Secrets
    On May 22nd, two young Oxford University students were tried in Bow Street Magistrates' Court in London, accused of violating government secrecy laws.
    The sequence of events was as follows: On February 26th of this year, an article entitled "The Truth About Border Incidents" was published in "Isis," a publication produced by Oxford University students. The following is an excerpt from the article:
      The Truth About Border Incidents
    "From Iraq to the Baltic Sea, and even further along the East-West border, listening stations have been established. Active duty soldiers, specially trained in Morse code or Russian, greedily record the telegrams sent by the radios of Russian ships, tanks, planes, and troops… It is believed that this shameless violation of the Geneva Conventions helps to correctly judge the size, type, and tactics of Russian armaments and troops.
    "To hunt for this kind of intelligence, Western countries even employ a large number of fraudulent means. Some British embassies routinely eavesdrop on telegrams. In 1955, when the Royal Navy fleet made a 'friendly' visit to Danzig (i.e. Gdansk), these spies were on board. Because the Russians cannot always provide the telegrams needed, they resort to provocative methods. So, an aircraft 'loses' its way, and then, behind the border, the recorders tensely record the conversations of the angered Russian pilots. Sometimes, our planes are forced to land by the Russians, and then a border incident occurs, and as usual, we publish the same old news release. The famous Lancaster bomber incident near Berlin was the result of this type of provocation.
    "…After the war, we established a squadron of high-speed torpedo boats, manned by former Hitler naval personnel, under the command of British captains, and sent them out to provoke and listen to Russian telegrams.
    "They headed towards the Russian fleet during exercises, circled a warship to take photos, and after taking all the pictures of the cannons and recording enough telegrams, they fled. In Swedish waters, they openly violated all international conventions, flying the Swedish flag.
    "One British captain with a wooden leg even went beyond the norm of operating in Russian territorial waters and actually sailed into the port of Leningrad. On one occasion, he even sent a small team ashore for reconnaissance… In 1956, the newly established German (West German) Navy took over all of these ships. Without a doubt, they are now happily continuing our policies."
      Crimes That Cannot Be Covered Up
    The authors of this article are the two defendants being tried in Bow Street Magistrates' Court: Thompson and Miller, Oxford University students who had previously served in the military.
    This article is not a fantasy or a fictional story, but a true account of what was seen and heard. Even the prosecutors and those invited by the court to testify had to admit it was factual. Court Prosecutor Jones, after reading the article aloud in court, also admitted: "Because some of the facts in the article are true, and the defendants also knew that they were of a top-secret nature, they must be prosecuted." Subsequently, Royal Navy officer Major Don Flander and others testified that Thompson and Miller had received specialized training in communication intelligence work, performing secret missions, during their service and had signed oaths of secrecy upon both entering service and upon discharge. Oxford City Police Detective Chief Inspector Bateman also testified that Miller had told him: "The facts in this article are all true. At least one hundred people at Oxford University are familiar with these facts. I myself did this kind of work."
    To avoid exposing more unmentionable acts, most of the trial was conducted in secret. The outcome of the trial has not yet been announced, but in its eagerness to convict the two leakers, Bow Street Magistrates' Court has inadvertently confessed to the crimes of provocation and espionage that Western countries, led by U.S. imperialism, have long carried out against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

### 牛津大学生泄露的秘密

    牛津大学生泄露的秘密
    5月22日，在伦敦的包街法院，牛津大学的两名青年学生，被控违反政府的保密法而受审讯。
    事情经过是这样的：今年2月26日，在牛津大学学生出版的一种名叫“爱西斯”的刊物上，登载了一篇题名“边境事件真相”的文章。下面是这篇文章的摘录：
      边境事件的真相
    “从伊拉克直到波罗的海，甚至更遥远的东西方边境上，都建立了收听站，受过莫尔斯电码或俄文专门训练的现役军人，贪婪地录下了俄国的船只、坦克、飞机、部队……的发报机发出的电报。据信，这种无耻地破坏日内瓦协定的办法，能够帮助正确判断俄国军备及部队的规模、类型和战术等。
    “为了猎取这类情报，西方国家甚至大量采用欺诈手段。英国的一些大使馆通常都有偷听电报的间谍。1955年，皇家海军舰队到但泽
  （即革但斯克）进行‘友好’访问时，这些间谍就在船上。由于俄国人不能时常提供所需要的电报，他们就采用挑衅的办法。于是，一架飞机‘迷失’了航线，这时，在边境后方的录音机就紧张地记录着被激怒了的俄国飞行员的对话。有时，我们的飞机被俄国人强迫降落了，于是就发生了边境事件，而我们照例用老一套办法发表新闻。在柏林附近发生的著名的兰开斯特型轰炸机事件，就是由于这种挑衅方式而产生的。
    “……战后，我们建立了一支超速鱼雷艇队，由前希特勒的海军人员驾驶，在英国的舰长指挥下，被派出去进行挑衅和收听俄国人的电报。
    “他们朝着正在演习的俄国舰队开去，绕着一艘战舰摄影，等到摄取了所有的大炮和录下了足够的电报之后就逃跑了。在瑞典的海面上，他们公然违反一切国际惯例，悬挂了瑞典国旗。
    “有一位装了一条木腿的英国舰长，甚至越出了在俄国领海活动的常规，居然将船开入列宁格勒港口。有一次，他还派了一小队人登陆侦察……。1956年，新建立的德国（西德）海军全部接管了这批舰艇，毫无疑问，他们现在正愉快地继续执行我们的政策。”
      掩盖不了的罪行
    这篇文章的作者，就是在包街法院被审判的两名被告：曾经服过兵役的牛津大学学生汤普森和米勒。
    这篇文章并不是幻想或虚构的故事，而是耳闻目击的真事。连那些检察员和被法院邀请去作证的人们也不得不承认是事实。法院检察员琼斯在法庭上宣读了这篇文章之后也承认：“由于文章中某些事实是真实的，而被告也知道它们是具有绝密性质的，因此必须对他们起诉。”接着，皇家海军军官唐·弗兰德少校等人证明汤普森和米勒在服役时，曾受过通讯情报工作方面执行秘密任务的专门训练，并且在受训和退役时都签署过保守秘密的誓言书。牛津城警察局的侦探长巴特曼也作证说，米勒对他说过：“这篇文章里的事实都是真的。牛津大学至少有一百人熟悉这些事实，我本人就是干这种工作的。”
    为了避免暴露更多的不可告人的勾当，这个案子大部分的审讯工作是秘密进行的。目前审讯结果尚未公布，但是包街法院为了急于将两名泄密者治罪，却在无意中供认了以美帝国主义为首的西方国家长期以来对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行挑衅及间谍活动的罪行。（龙）
