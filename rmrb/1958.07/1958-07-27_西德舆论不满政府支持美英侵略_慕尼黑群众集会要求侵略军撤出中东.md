Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Bonn News – The West German government's statement on the 23rd, openly supporting US-British aggression in the Middle East, has aroused strong dissatisfaction among West German public opinion.

    In a press release, the West German Social Democratic Party condemned the statement as proof of the Bonn government's "unconditional dependence" on American policy, and worried that US Secretary of State Dulles's visit to Bonn on the 26th might drag West Germany into "a conflict that has nothing to do with it."

    The "Neue Rheinische Zeitung" also criticized the West German government's statement. It linked the statement with US Ambassador to Bonn Bruce's visit to Chancellor Adenauer on the 23rd, and clearly pointed out that the West German government's statement was issued based on a "signal from the White House."

    In another article, the "Neue Rheinische Zeitung" condemned West Germany's support for US-British aggression. The article, entitled "We Are an American Aircraft Carrier," said, "The Americans are treating West Germany as an advanced military base, and in fact, West Germany is playing such a role. American ground and air forces can launch attacks from here. The base is now dispatching aircraft, and later it can also launch atomic missiles." The newspaper emphasized that it is now very clear how dangerous a role West Germany will play in the event of war: it will inevitably become a battlefield. The newspaper demanded a re-examination of the "North Atlantic Treaty" and a more careful study of the plan to establish a Central European "buffer zone."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: A mass rally protesting US-British aggression in the Near and Middle East was held in Munich, West Germany. Speakers at the rally emphasized that it is necessary to actively struggle against the Bonn government's turning West Germany into a base for US-British intervention in the Middle East. Participants expressed support for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-nation government summit, believing that this proposal pointed out a way out of the current crisis. Participants at the rally unanimously demanded that US-British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

    In addition, more than one hundred Arab students studying at the University of Mainz in West Germany held a demonstration on the 23rd to protest the US-British military intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. They held signs with slogans such as "The people are stronger than power politics!" and "Arabia calls on the people of the world: Defend peace, stop the aggressors!" West German police violently dispersed the march.

    The Social Democratic Party's "Social Democratic Press Release," in commenting on the Middle East situation, wrote: "Iraq was once the link and core of the Baghdad Pact, but now the Baghdad Pact can no longer be revived, and its basic ideas have been destroyed. The policy of military blocs is as unworkable in this region as it is in other parts of the world. The spearhead of this policy is turning around and pointing at its planners."

    西德舆论不满政府支持美英侵略
    慕尼黑群众集会要求侵略军撤出中东
    新华社25日讯　波恩消息：西德政府23日发表的公开支持美英在中东侵略行动的声明，引起了西德舆论的强烈不满。
    西德社会民主党在新闻公报中谴责这个声明是波恩政府“无条件依附”美国政策的一个证明，并且担心，美国国务卿杜勒斯26日来波恩的访问可能会把西德拖进“一场根本同它无关的冲突”。
    “新莱因报”也抨击西德政府的这个声明。它把这个声明同美国驻波恩大使布鲁斯23日对阿登纳总理的拜访联系起来，并且明白指出，西德政府的声明是根据“白宫的讯号”发表的。
    “新莱因报”在另一篇文章中谴责西德支持美英侵略的行动。这篇文章的题目是“我们是美国的一艘航空母舰”，它说，“美国人正把西德当作前哨军事基地，而事实上西德也正是起着这样的作用。美国的陆军和空军可以从这里出发去打仗。基地上现在出动的是飞机，而以后还可以发射原子导弹。”报纸强调说，一旦发生战争时，西德将要充当多么危险的脚色，现在已经很清楚：它将不可避免地成为战场。报纸要求重新审查“北大西洋公约”和更加慎重地研究建立中欧“缓冲区”的计划。
    据新华社25日讯　西德慕尼黑市举行了一次抗议美英侵略中近东的群众大会。会上讲话的人都强调指出，必须积极进行斗争来反对波恩政府把西德变成美英干涉中东的据点。到会者表示支持苏联关于召开五国政府首脑会议的建议，认为这个建议指出了摆脱当前危机的出路。大会参加者一致要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    另外，在西德美因兹大学留学的一百多名阿拉伯学生23日举行了一次抗议美英军队干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的示威游行。他们举着的标语牌上写着“人民比实力政策更强有力！”和“阿拉伯号召全世界人民：维护和平，制止侵略者！”等口号。西德警察用暴力解散了游行队伍。
    社会民主党的“社会民主新闻公报”在评论中东局势时写道：“伊拉克曾经是巴格达条约的纽带和核心，而现在巴格达条约不可能再复活了，它的基本思想已经被摧毁。军事集团政策在这个地区也同在世界其它地区一样地行不通。这种政策的矛头正反转过来对准它的策划者。”
