Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 3rd. The Lou Mountain Pass Tunnel on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line, with a total length of 2,143 meters, was completed on June 30th, half a year ahead of schedule.

The Lou Mountain Pass Tunnel is one of the three key projects on the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway line. Construction began in July 1956, with completion originally planned for the end of this year. However, after rectification and the Two-Anti movement, the tunnel workers put forward the fighting slogan of "Tunnel Completion in June, Dedication to the Party in July, Completion of the Project in September" and launched a labor competition, constantly setting new records for tunnel excavation. For example, the monthly advancement of the pilot tunnel in June increased from 184 meters in May to 280 meters.

Lou Mountain Pass is located in the northern part of Guizhou Province, more than 1,300 meters above sea level. During the Long March, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries here and seized the victory to liberate the city of Zunyi.

    娄山关隧道打通
    新华社贵阳3日电　川黔铁路线上全长二千一百四十三公尺的娄山关隧道，比原计划提前半年在6月30日打通。
    娄山关隧道是川黔铁路线上的三大重点工程之一，从1956年7月开始施工，计划在今年年底打通。但是，隧道工人们经过整风和双反运动，提出了“6月打通、7月向党献礼、9月完工”的战斗口号，展开了劳动竞赛，不断创造开挖隧道的新纪录。例如6月份的月进导坑就由5月份的一百八十四公尺提高到二百八十公尺。
    娄山关位于贵州省北部，拔海一千三百多公尺。中国工农红军长征时曾在这里打败了国民党反动军队，并乘胜解放了遵义城。
