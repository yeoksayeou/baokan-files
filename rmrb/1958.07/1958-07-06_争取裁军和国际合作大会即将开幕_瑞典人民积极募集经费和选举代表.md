Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: According to TASS, Stockholm, July 4th: Stockholm continues to actively prepare for the Conference for Disarmament and International Cooperation, which will open on July 16th.

Currently, many cities and settlements in Sweden are raising funds and electing members of the Swedish delegation. The preparations for the conference are taking place amidst the Swedish public's opposition to the threat of nuclear weapons and opposition to the conspiracy of some individuals who want to equip Sweden with atomic weapons. The activities of the recently established "Action Group Against Swedish Atomic Bombs" are fully in line with the tasks of the upcoming conference.

According to "News Morning Post," a group of Swedish doctors, led by Dr. Inghe, visited Swedish Foreign Minister Undén on the 3rd and handed him a petition signed by 213 Swedish doctors. This petition called for a halt to nuclear testing and opposition to the production of nuclear weapons.

    争取裁军和国际合作大会即将开幕
    瑞典人民积极募集经费和选举代表
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩4日讯：斯德哥尔摩继续积极筹备将在7月16日开幕的争取裁军和国际合作大会。
    现在瑞典许多城市和居民点都在募集经费和选举瑞典代表团人员。大会的筹备工作是在瑞典公众反对核武器威胁，反对某些人士想实现以原子武器装备瑞典的阴谋的情况下进行的。最近成立的“反对瑞典原子弹行动小组”的活动完全符合即将召开的大会的任务。
    据“新闻晨报”报道，以英哲博士为首的一批瑞典医生3日拜会了瑞典外交大臣恩顿，并且把一份有二百一十三名瑞典医生签名的呼吁书交给他，这个呼吁书要求停止核试验和反对制造核武器。
