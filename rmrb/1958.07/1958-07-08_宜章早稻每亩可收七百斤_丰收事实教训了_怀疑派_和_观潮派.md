Yizhang Early Rice Yields 700 Jin Per Mu
Bumper Harvest Teaches "Skeptics" and "Wait-and-See Observers" a Lesson

(Our dispatch) Reporter Hu Jian reports: Yizhang County, Hunan Province, the first county to begin harvesting early rice, estimates that this year's more than 100,000 mu of early rice will yield an average of more than 700 jin per mu, based on the harvested examples and the field-by-field estimates of the unharvested areas. This is an increase of two and a half times compared to last year, when the county suffered its worst insect plague, and more than double the normal yield.

This spring, when the Yizhang County Party Committee proposed a great leap forward in agriculture this year, many people did not believe it. They thought, how could this mountainous county, where the average early rice yield was only 205 jin per mu last year and which suffered the worst insect damage in Hunan, make such a leap? The bumper harvest of early rice gave the skeptics a sharp rebuke.

Judging from the harvested examples from various places, this year's early rice is not only abundant in the plains but also in the mountain valleys, not only in good fields but also in poor fields. Among the county's 461 cooperatives, 25 have already been found that can achieve 1,000 jin in the early rice season alone. The several mu of fields harvested by the Liulan Cooperative are the "dead yellow mud fields" that the masses consider "like a knife on a sunny day, a mess in the rain." This year, each mu yielded 805 jin of dry grain, three times more than last year. This year, the county expanded double-cropping rice and proposed planting early rice in the mountain valleys. Many upper-middle peasants predicted that they would only harvest "a handful of grass," but currently, the more than 15,000 mu of early rice in the mountain valleys can generally yield 700-800 jin.

Yizhang County has always been a "disaster-prone insect" county. Last year, rice planthoppers spread throughout the county in just eleven days, reducing rice production by more than 14 million jin. This year, the county started transplanting early rice before Qingming (April 5th) and finished in mid-April, more than 20 days earlier than last year. Many upper-middle peasants also disagreed with this. They openly stated that planting early would cause insects to appear early, and eventually, everyone would have no rice for the New Year. It seemed that the facts "proved" these people right. Rice planthoppers and other insect pests arrived more than 20 days earlier than last year. On May 30th, an inspection revealed that 90% of the early rice fields were infested with pests. As a result, many upper-middle peasants stood by and made sarcastic remarks: "Bumper harvest, bumper harvest, now it's a 'wind harvest' (they said that the south wind brings insects)!" "Look how generous you are, planting early to feed the insects!"

However, the wait-and-see observers rejoiced too early. On the evening of June 3rd, the County Party Committee issued a general mobilization order to the entire county to fight against insect pests. Subsequently, more than 100,000 people in the county were mobilized overnight to control the pests. In this way, four large-scale insect control campaigns were organized, and more than 400 native drug factories were established throughout the county, producing more than 2.9 million jin of native drugs. Using both native and foreign drugs, the insect pests were basically eliminated. The wait-and-see observers had to admit: "The Communist Party says what it does."

After transplanting 20 days early, the county encountered more than 20 consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather and two or three cold snaps. In addition, some fields lacked sufficient base fertilizer, causing the seedlings to turn yellow and not green. Statistics from mid-May showed that 17% of the county's early rice seedlings were of the third category. At this time, the wait-and-see observers started talking again: "Qingming cuts off snow, Guyu cuts off frost, planting early rice is bound to suffer." The county mobilized more than 70,000 people to carry out a concentrated effort to cultivate and topdress, "treating" the third category seedlings. On average, more than 70 dan of quick-acting fertilizer was applied per mu, and the seedlings quickly turned green.

The tide of bumper harvests has awakened many conservatives who doubted the great leap forward in agriculture from their dreams. Now, talking about yields of 1,000 jin per mu in the countryside is no longer a big deal, and many people have automatically proposed slogans to march towards yields of 2,000 jin, 3,000 jin, and 4,000 jin per mu. In the past, people who insisted that "sparse seedlings yield grain, dense seedlings yield grass" are now coming forward to summarize the five major benefits of close planting: no lodging, uniform heading, long ears, early maturity, and more grain. After the bumper harvest became a certainty, "three kinds of regrets" appeared in the countryside: those who did not plant densely regretted it, those who did not start the season early regretted it, and those who should have planted double-cropping early rice but did not regret it. These regretful people are mainly relatively wealthy individual farmers, who now also admit that there is strength in numbers and are actively requesting to join the cooperatives. Recently, more than 450 individual farming households in the county have voluntarily applied to join agricultural cooperatives.

    宜章早稻每亩可收七百斤
    丰收事实教训了“怀疑派”和“观潮派”
    本报讯  记者胡坚报道：湖南省第一个开始收割早稻的宜章县，根据已经收割的实例和未收割地区逐社逐丘的估算，今年全县十万多亩早稻，平均每亩可收七百多斤，比受虫灾最严重的去年增加两倍半，比常年产量增加一倍多。
    今年春天，中共宜章县委提出今年要来个农业大跃进时，好些人都不相信，认为这个在去年早稻平均亩产只有二百零五斤、虫害在湖南数第一的山区县，怎能跃得起来呢？早稻大丰收给怀疑派碰了一个大钉子。
    从各地收割的实例来看，今年早稻不仅平田丰收，山冲田也丰收，不仅好田增产，瘦田也增产。全县四百六十一个社，已发现有二十五个社光早稻一季就能实现一千斤。留览社已收割的几亩田，是群众认为“天晴一把刀，落雨三团糟”的死黄泥田，今年每亩收了八百零五斤干谷，比去年增加三倍。今年全县扩大双季稻，提出早稻进山冲时，很多上中农算定会收“一把草”，但是目前山冲里的一万五千多亩早稻，一般可收七、八百斤。
    宜章县历来是个“虫灾”县，去年稻飞虱只有十一天就蔓及全县，受虫灾减产一千四百多万斤稻谷。今年全县早稻在清明前（4月5日）就开始插秧，4月中旬结束，较去年提早二十多天。许多上中农对此也不同意。公开提出插得早，起虫早，将来会落得大家没有过年米。事实好像给这批人“看中”了。稻飞虱等虫害比去年果然早来二十多天。5月30日检查，90％的早稻田发生虫害。于是很多上中农站在旁边冷嘲热讽起来了：“丰收，丰收，这下‘风收’（他们说南风起虫）了！”“你们看大方，早插送给虫吃！”
    但是，观潮派未免高兴得太早了。6月3日晚上，县委向全县发布了向虫害进军的总动员令，接着全县十多万人就连夜出动治虫。这样，前后组织了四次大规模的治虫战役，全县办起土药工厂四百多个，采制土药二百九十多万斤，土药洋药并用，基本上消灭了虫害。观潮派不得不承认：“共产党说到哪里就做到哪里。”
    提早二十多天插秧以后，就碰上连续二十多天的阴雨和两三次寒潮的袭击，加上有些田基肥不足，造成禾苗发黄，不转青。5月中旬统计，全县早稻三类禾苗占17％。这时，观潮派又谈论起来了：“清明断雪，谷雨断霜，早插禾一定遭殃。”全县出动七万多人，突击中耕追肥，“医治”三类禾苗，平均每亩又追施速效性肥料七十多担，禾苗很快转青了。
    丰收的浪潮把许多怀疑农业大跃进的保守派，从睡梦中冲醒了。现在农村谈亩产千斤粮，已不在话下，好些人自动提出向亩产二千斤、三千斤、四千斤进军的口号。过去硬说“稀禾谷，密禾草”的人，现在，自己出来总结密植有不倒伏，抽穗齐，线子长，成熟早，多收谷等五大好处。丰收已成定局后，农村中出现“三种后悔人”：没有密植的人后悔，没有提早季节的人后悔，该插双季早稻而没有插的人后悔。这些后悔的人，主要是比较富裕的单干农民，现在也都承认人多力量大，纷纷要求入社。最近全县有四百五十多户单干农民自动申请加入农业社。
