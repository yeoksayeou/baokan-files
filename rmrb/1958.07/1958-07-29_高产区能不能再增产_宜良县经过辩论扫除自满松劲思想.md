Can High-Yield Areas Increase Production Again?
Yiliang County Eliminates Complacency and Slackness Through Debate

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Huang Changlu reports: Two hundred thousand people in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, launched a massive debate on whether or not to increase production at high speed, sweeping away the complacency, conservatism, and slackness of cadres and farmers.
    Yiliang is a high-yield grain county in Yunnan, with an average yield of 866 jin per mu last year. This year, under severe drought conditions, cadres and farmers throughout the county fought tenaciously against the drought, expanding the rice planting area from 170,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu, and promptly completing the planting of 50,000 mu of dry land. Cultivation techniques have been greatly improved compared to previous years, with the average fertilizer application per mu increasing from 4,000 jin last year to 50,000 jin, and plowing and harrowing being more refined than last year. Now the fields are a lush green. Seeing this phenomenon, some cadres and masses felt that increasing production was no longer a problem. Many people also said, "After seven months of hard work, it's time to take a break." Morale began to slacken, and the progress of mid-season plowing and weeding was slow.
    In response to this phenomenon, the Yiliang County Party Committee launched a mass debate involving the entire population. The debate was first unveiled at a conference of county, township, and commune cadres held in early this month. After the conference, the flames of debate spread to every corner of the county, with tens of thousands of large-character posters and countless verbal arguments targeting complacency, conservatism, and slackness. The central question of the debate was whether this year's production should be increased by a few percentage points in an ordinary way, or whether it should be increased at high speed, doubling the output. Was high-speed production increase possible? Everyone studied the examples of high wheat yields and visited the seedlings of the Happiness Commune, deeply feeling that the potential of the land was great and that high-speed production increase was entirely possible. In response to the current shortcomings in production, three major measures were decided upon. First, transplanting and intercropping should be carried out immediately to make up for the lack of dense planting, increasing the average number of rice seedlings per mu in the county from 20,000 to over 50,000. Second, the county decided to vigorously promote chemical fertilizers, with fertilizer processing plants being widely established in various townships and communes, and vigorously accumulating green manure and native fertilizer. Third, teams should be immediately organized to intensify mid-season plowing and weeding, requiring weeding five times and timely elimination of pests.
    While debating, the 200,000 people in the county were also taking action, and the red flag competition between townships, communes, teams, and individuals had been launched in full swing.

    高产区能不能再增产
    宜良县经过辩论扫除自满松劲思想
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：云南省宜良县二十万群众开展能不能高速度增产的大辩论，把干部和农民中的自满、保守、松劲思想一扫而光。
    宜良是云南的粮食高产县，去年平均每亩产量已达八百六十六斤。今年在严重的干旱下，全县干部和农民顽强地与干旱斗争，使水稻种植面积由去年十七万亩扩大到二十万亩，五万亩旱地及时栽完。耕作技术比往年大为提高，每亩田地平均施肥量由去年四千斤增加到五万斤，犁耙也比去年精细。现在田野里一片绿油油的。有些干部和群众看见这种现象，觉得增产已不成问题。还有不少人说：“一连苦战了七个月，也该歇歇气了。”情绪开始松懈，中耕夏锄的进展缓慢。
    宜良县委针对这种现象开展了一场全民大辩论。辩论首先在本月上旬召开的县、乡、社三级干部会议上揭开，会议结束后，辩论之火烧到全县每个角落，千万张大字报、千万把唇枪舌剑指向自满、保守和松劲思想。辩论的中心问题是今年要普普通通地增产几成呢，还是成倍地高速度增产？高速度增产是否可能？大家研究了小麦高产的实例，并且参观了幸福社的禾苗，深感田地潜力很大，高速度增产是完全可能的。针对当前生产中的缺点，决定了三大措施。第一是马上移栽套种，补密植的课，使全县每亩稻田禾苗平均由两万窝增加到五万窝以上。第二，县里决定大干化学肥料，各乡、社普遍建立肥料加工厂，大积绿肥和土肥。第三是立即组织队伍，加紧进行中耕夏锄，要求薅秧五次，及时扑灭虫害。
    全县二十万群众一边辩论，一边行动，乡与乡、社与社、队与队以及个人之间的红旗竞赛已热火朝天地展开。
