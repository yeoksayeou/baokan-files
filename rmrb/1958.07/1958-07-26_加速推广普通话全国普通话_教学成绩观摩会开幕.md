Xinhua News Agency, July 25th. The National Putonghua Teaching Achievement Observation Meeting, jointly organized by the Central Putonghua Promotion Committee and the Ministry of Education, opened in Beijing on the 25th. This observation meeting aims to showcase achievements, exchange experiences, and promote and accelerate the spread of Putonghua, so as to further unify the Chinese language and better serve socialist construction.

More than one hundred teachers, students (the youngest being eight years old), and educational administrators with outstanding achievements in teaching and promoting Putonghua were selected from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country to participate in this observation meeting. Most of these teachers and students could only speak local dialects two years ago. At this observation meeting, they will use a unified language—Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard—to perform some literary recitation programs or report on their experiences in promoting Putonghua. Members of the Central Putonghua Promotion Committee in Beijing, experts and scholars in language reform and Putonghua promotion in the capital, and relevant staff members will also participate in this observation meeting.

Wu Yuzhang, Deputy Director of the Central Putonghua Promotion Committee and Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said that over the past three years, great achievements have been made in promoting Putonghua in various regions. By the end of last year, more than 700,000 primary and secondary school teachers across the country had learned Putonghua and started to use it in teaching. Many cities' schools have enthusiastically launched socialist competitions for learning and promoting Putonghua. Now, teachers, students, and staff in schools in many dialect areas can all speak Putonghua, which has influenced the surrounding masses. In Wushan Township, Datian County, Fujian Province, under the leadership of the Party committee, the masses worked hard for fifty days and nights, enabling 77.7% of the young, adults, and all cadres in the township to speak Putonghua. He said that these situations show that the masses warmly support Putonghua, and promoting Putonghua has increasingly become an urgent need in the daily lives of the broad masses. However, promoting Putonghua nationwide is still a long-term and arduous political task. In the future, all regions should strengthen publicity and continue to adopt various methods to further popularize the work of promoting Putonghua on the existing basis, to further boost the upsurge in learning Putonghua, and strive to complete the glorious task of promoting Putonghua as soon as possible, so as to meet the needs of China's socialist construction.

Wei Que, Vice Minister of Education, then spoke. He briefly introduced the situation of Putonghua promotion work across the country after the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955 and the State Council's "Instructions on Promoting Putonghua" in February 1956, and emphasized that the promulgation of the "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" last year and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production have greatly promoted the great leap forward in Putonghua promotion work. He also cited typical examples of outstanding achievements in promoting and learning Putonghua, such as Wushan Township in Datian, Fujian, Huanglu Normal School in Chaoxian, Anhui, Shunxing Road Primary School in Qingdao, Wen Hui, a teacher at a Miao ethnic minority school in Guizhou, and Zhang Jimin, a student at Nanguan Jianshe Street Primary School in Linyi, Shandong. He said that as long as we adhere to putting politics in command, relying on the leadership of the Party committee, following the mass line, mobilizing the consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses, learning the phonetic alphabet well, mastering the correspondence between dialect phonetics and Putonghua phonetics, and constantly studying and practicing, we can make the work of promoting Putonghua leap forward again and again.

After the opening ceremony, eleven representatives from Shandong, Guizhou, Jilin, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Fujian, Shanxi, and other provinces performed Putonghua observation programs and reported on their work experience. These observation programs will continue from the 26th to the 30th.

    加速推广普通话全国普通话
    教学成绩观摩会开幕
    据新华社25日讯　中央推广普通话工作委员会和教育部联合举办的全国普通话教学成绩观摩会25日在北京开幕。这次观摩会，是为了表演成绩，交流经验，促进和加速普通话的推广，使汉语进一步统一和更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    参加这次观摩会的有全国各省、市、自治区选拔出来的在教学和推广普通话工作有优秀成绩的教师、学生（最小的八岁）和教育行政工作者共一百多人。这些教师和学生中，绝大部分在两年以前还只会说当地的方言。在这次观摩会上，他们将要使用一种统一的语言——以北京语音为标准音的普通话表演一些文艺朗诵节目，或者报告他们推广普通话的经验。参加这次观摩会的还有中央推广普通话工作委员会在京委员、首都的文字改革和推广普通话的专家、学者和有关工作人员。
    观摩会由中央推广普通话工作委员会副主任、中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章致开幕词。他说，三年来，各地推广普通话的工作已经取得了很大的成绩。到去年年底，全国就已有七十多万中小学教师学会了普通话，并且开始在教学中应用。不少城市的学校之间热烈地开展了学习和推广普通话的社会主义竞赛。现在有许多方言地区学校的全校师生员工已经都会说普通话，并且影响了周围群众。福建大田县吴山乡群众在党委领导下苦战五十昼夜，使全乡77.7％的少、青、壮年和所有干部都会说普通话。他说，这些情况说明，群众是热烈拥护普通话的，推广普通话已经日益成为广大群众日常生活中的迫切需要。但是，在全国范围内推广普通话仍然是一个长期的艰巨的政治任务，今后各地都应该加强宣传，继续采取各种办法，使推广普通话的工作在现有的基础上进一步普及，学习普通话的热潮进一步高涨，争取尽快完成推广普通话这一光荣任务，以适应我国社会主义建设的需要。
    教育部副部长韦悫接着讲话。他扼要地介绍了1955年10月全国文字改革会议和1956年2月国务院发布“关于推广普通话的指示”以后全国各地推广普通话工作的情况，并且着重指出，去年“汉语拼音方案”的公布和工农业生产的大跃进，大大地推动了推广普通话工作的跃进。他还举出了福建大田吴山乡、安徽巢县黄麓师范、青岛顺兴路小学和贵州苗族民校教员文辉、山东临沂南关建设街小学学生张继敏等单位和个人，在推广和学习普通话中创造优异成绩的典型事例。他说，只要作到了政治挂帅、依靠党委领导，走群众路线、发动群众的自觉性、积极性、创造性，学好拼音字母、掌握方言语音和普通话语音的对音规律，并且不断学习和练习，就可以使推广普通话的工作跃进再跃进。
    开幕式结束后，山东、贵州、吉林、江西、辽宁、福建、山西等省的十一位代表表演了普通话观摩节目和报告了工作经验。这种观摩节目将在26日到30日继续进行。
