    Terylene Synthetic Fiber
    Light Resistance, Heat Resistance, and Wrinkle Resistance Surpass Nylon

    The Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Institute of Chemical Research under the Ministry of Chemical Industry has successfully trial-produced a type of Terylene synthetic fiber. After inspection, its quality has exceeded British standards.

    Terylene synthetic fiber is a new type of synthetic fiber that has been developed internationally in the past five years. Its light resistance, heat resistance, and wrinkle resistance all surpass synthetic fibers such as Nylon, Kapron, and Vinylon. When used to make various fabrics and clothing, it has a wool-like feel, is not prone to wrinkles, and is resistant to bacterial erosion, as well as damage from termites and beetles.

    Terylene synthetic fiber has excellent electrical insulation and heat resistance properties. It can also maintain its strength when wet. Therefore, it can also be used to make ropes, fishing nets, filter cloths, and tires for maritime use, possessing many advantages that other synthetic fibers do not have. In particular, Terylene synthetic fiber, when blended with cotton, wool, or other natural fibers, is five times more durable than natural fibers alone. Therefore, Terylene synthetic fiber has been called "magic fiber" in Japan. In order to profit from the production of Terylene synthetic fiber, Japanese capitalists spent 10 billion yen in 1956 to purchase the technical patent from a British company that produces Terylene, naming it "Tetoron."

    However, relying only on extremely incomplete data, our country's engineers and technicians successfully trial-produced Terylene synthetic fiber in just two months. Currently, the Shenyang Branch is about to mass-produce the Terylene raw material terephthalic acid; the intermediate factory for producing Terylene synthetic fiber has also been built, and Terylene synthetic fiber fabrics will be produced and supplied to the market by National Day this year.

### 特丽纶合成纤维  耐光耐热及抗皱性能超过尼龙

    特丽纶合成纤维
    耐光耐热及抗皱性能超过尼龙
    化工部北京化工研究院沈阳分院试制成功一种特丽纶合成纤维。经过检定，质量已超过英国水平。
    特丽纶合成纤维在国际上还是近五年发展起来的新型合成纤维。他的耐光性、耐热性及抗皱性等，均超过尼龙、卡普隆、和维尼龙等合成纤维。用它制做各种衣料、服装，穿上有羊毛状之感觉，不易起皱纹，同时它能防细菌的侵蚀，不易受白蚁及甲虫的损伤。
    特丽纶合成纤维具有优良的电绝缘和耐热性能，潮湿时也能保持干的强度，因此，又能用于制做航海用的绳索、鱼网、滤布和轮胎等，具有许多其他合成纤维所没有的优点。特别是特丽纶合成纤维与棉、毛，或其他天然纤维混纺后，则比天然纤维耐穿性能高五倍。因此特丽纶合成纤维在日本曾有“魔法纤维”之称。日本资本家为了生产特丽纶合成纤维获得利润，曾于1956年不惜以一百亿日元向英国一个生产特丽纶的公司购取了技术专利，并取名为“台德隆”。
    但我国工程技术人员，仅依靠手中极不完整的资料，用两月时间就试制成功了特丽纶合成纤维。目前，沈阳分院即将大量生产特丽纶原料对苯二甲酸；生产特丽纶合成纤维的中间厂也已经建成，今年国庆节即能生产出特丽纶合成纤维的织物，供应市场。
