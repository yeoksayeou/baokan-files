Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Soviet Youth Advanced Producers and Scientific and Technical Workers Delegation left Beijing this morning to visit Northeast China and other regions.

During their stay in Beijing, the advanced workers and engineering technicians in the delegation visited the Beijing Electron Tube Factory, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Jingxi Chengzi Coal Mine, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to hold discussions with Chinese youth workers, perform technical demonstrations, and impart their advanced technical experience. Demidov, a lathe operator from the Minsk Automobile Factory's cutting laboratory, demonstrated high-speed cutting at the Electron Tube Factory, which was six times faster than the factory's original work efficiency. At the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Demidov demonstrated the most advanced cutting method—heavy-duty cutting—to the young workers. With his help and guidance, some of the factory's workers have now mastered this advanced operation method, greatly improving production efficiency. Engineer Nikitin also made many rationalization proposals during his visit to the factory. The scientific and technical workers in the delegation held discussions with scientific research workers from various specialized colleges and central professional departments. The Communist Youth League cadres in the delegation, in discussions with cadres and members of the Communist Youth League at all levels in Beijing, introduced the work experience of the Soviet Communist Youth League.

    苏联青年代表团离京到东北参观
    据新华社4日讯　苏联青年先进生产者和科学技术工作者代表团今天上午离开北京前往东北等地区参观访问。
    在北京期间，代表团中的先进工人和工程技术人员曾分别到北京电子管厂、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、京西城子煤矿、石景山钢铁厂等单位同中国青年工人座谈，并进行技术表演，传授他们的先进技术经验。明斯克汽车厂切削实验室旋工杰米多夫在电子管厂表演了快速切削，比这个厂原来的工效快六倍。在长辛店机车车辆修理工厂，杰米多夫给青年工人们表演了最先进的切削方法——强力切削。在他的帮助和指导下，这个厂的部分工人现在已掌握了这一先进的操作方法，生产效率大大提高。工程师尼基金在参观这个厂时还提出了许多合理化建议。代表团中的科学技术工作者分别同各专业院校和中央专业部门的科学研究工作者举行了座谈。代表团中的共青团干部在分别同北京市各级团的干部及团员座谈时，介绍了苏联共青团的工作经验。
