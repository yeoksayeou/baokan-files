    Take Steel as the Key Link
    Wang Pu
    At the Local Industry Conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, raised a fundamental issue in his concluding speech—take steel as the key link to promote the great development of the machinery industry and the universal development of other industries.
    Since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the policy of the whole party and the whole people running industry, a situation of great leap forward in local industry has been formed across the country. Tens of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises have spread throughout urban and rural areas, the original industrial bases are expanding day by day, and economic regions with relatively complete industrial systems are gradually taking shape. The new situation of the great leap forward in industry has put forward a new and urgent issue for us, which is to demand the rapid development of the steel industry. At present, in many places, due to the shortage of steel, the machinery manufacturing industry cannot develop vigorously, and local industries and agriculture, which are like ten thousand arrows being fired and ten thousand horses galloping, cannot get equipment and tools in time. Taking Shandong Province as an example, it was originally planned to produce 100,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment in the first half of this year, but due to the shortage of steel, only 20,000 horsepower were produced from January to May; the various power and mechanical equipment urgently needed for industrial construction could not be produced in large quantities due to the shortage of steel. Vigorously developing the steel industry has become an important step for the continued advancement of local industrial construction.
    In the long run, vigorously developing the steel industry is even more crucial to ensuring and promoting local industrial construction from one upsurge to another. The steel industry is the foundation of modern industry and the backbone of industrialization. The development of the machinery industry, the power industry, the coal mining industry, the chemical industry, and the transportation industry must all have a strong steel industry as their foundation. According to general calculations, every 10 million yuan increase in the output value of the machinery manufacturing industry requires an increase of 1,500 tons of steel; every 10 million yuan increase in the construction and installation workload of capital construction requires an increase of 2,200 tons of steel; laying every 100 kilometers of railway requires 13,000 tons of steel rails and accessories; building a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of synthetic ammonia requires 33,000 tons of various steels. Therefore, without the initial development of the steel industry, there can be no comprehensive leap forward in other industries, nor can there be agricultural mechanization, transportation mechanization, and rural electrification. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the high-speed development of steel, especially steel, can also drive the rapid development of other industries. Because to increase steel production, it is necessary to correspondingly increase iron production; to increase iron production, it is necessary to correspondingly increase the production of coal, coke, ore, and electricity; it is necessary to correspondingly increase the production of steelmaking equipment, ironmaking equipment, mining equipment, coal mining equipment, coking equipment, power generation equipment, and geological exploration equipment. Therefore, it can be said that steel is a key link connecting the entire industry, and its speed of development determines the speed of the entire industrialization, the speed of the entire agricultural modernization, and the speed of the entire technological revolution.
    There is an old Chinese saying, "When the key link is raised, the net opens." To strive for high speed, we hope that Party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries, will earnestly grasp the key link of steel.

    以钢为纲  
    王朴
    在中共山东省委召开的地方工业会议上，中共山东省委第一书记舒同同志在他的总结发言中，提出了一个带有根本性质的问题——以钢为纲，促进机械工业的大发展，和其他工业的普遍发展。
    自从党中央提出全党全民办工业的方针以来，全国地方工业大跃进的局面已经形成。数以万计的中小型企业已经遍布城乡，原有的工业基地一天天扩大，具有比较完整的工业体系的经济区域正在逐步形成。工业大跃进的新形势，给我们提出了一个新的、迫切的问题，这就是要求钢铁工业的迅速发展。目前，许多地方由于钢铁的不足，机械制造工业不能大力发展，万箭齐发、万马齐奔般的地方工业和农业就不能及时地得到设备和工具，以山东省为例，原计划今年上半年生产排灌设备十万马力，因为钢铁不足，1至5月份只生产了二万马力；工业建设急需的各种动力、机械设备，也因为钢铁的不足不能大量生产。大力发展钢铁工业，已经成为当前地方工业建设继续前进的一个重要步骤。
    从长远来看，大力发展钢铁工业更是保证和推动地方工业建设从一个高潮走到另一个高潮的关键。钢铁工业是现代工业的基础，是工业化的脊梁。机械工业、电力工业、采煤工业、化学工业以及交通运输业的发展，都必须有强大的钢铁工业做基础。根据一般的计算，机械制造工业每提高一千万元的产值，就需要增加一千五百吨钢铁；基本建设中每增加一千万元的建筑安装工作量，就需要增加二千二百吨钢材；铺设每一百公里的铁路，就需要一万三千吨钢轨及配件；建设一个年产十万吨合成氨的化肥厂，就需要各种钢材三万三千吨。因此，没有钢铁工业的首先发展，就不可能有其它工业的全面大跃进，也不可能有农业机械化、交通运输机械化和农村电气化的出现。这是一方面。另一方面，钢铁特别是钢的高速度发展，也能带动其他工业的迅速发展。因为要增加钢产量，就必须相应地增加铁的产量，要增加铁的产量，就必须相应地增加煤、焦炭、矿石和电力的产量，就要相应地增加炼钢设备、炼铁设备、采矿设备、采煤设备、炼焦设备、发电设备以及地质勘探设备的产量。因此，可以说，钢是连接着整个工业的一条纲，它的发展速度，决定着整个工业化的速度，决定着整个农业现代化的速度，决定着整个技术革命的速度。
    我国有句古话，叫做“纲举目张”。要力争高速度，希望各级党委、特别是第一书记，切实把钢这条纲抓起来。
