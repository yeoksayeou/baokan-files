Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 13th. The People's Liberation Army First Automotive Tractor Management School has successfully trial-produced a small AC generator using black iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets. This 1.5 kilowatt small generator, after 18 hours of continuous test run, had all its components completely normal. This pioneering achievement not only solves the difficulty of insufficient silicon steel sheets for manufacturing generators, but also reduces costs, opening up a new path for the mass production of small generators suitable for small rural hydropower.

The idea of using black iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets to trial-produce generators was proposed by worker Lü Dequan of the school's practice factory while studying the General Line. This proposal quickly received the support of the school authorities, who sent two workers and one teacher to form a trial production team. After five days and nights of hard work and multiple test runs and improvements, they finally succeeded in trial-producing it. After technical appraisal, it fully meets the requirements and can be put into production.

    解决发电机原料困难的好方法
    用黑铁片代替矽钢片
    新华社南京13日电　人民解放军第一汽车拖拉机管理学校用黑铁皮代替矽钢片试制小型交流发电机成功。这种一点五瓩小型发电机，经十八小时连续试车，一切机件完全正常。这一创举，不仅解决了制造发电机用的矽钢片不足的困难，而且降低了成本，为大量生产适于农村小型水力冲动的小型发电机，开辟了新路。
    用黑铁皮代替矽钢片试制发电机是这个学校实习工厂工人吕德铨学习总路线时提出的。这个主张迅速得到校方支持，派了两名工人一位教员，组成试制组。经过五昼夜的苦战和多次试运转、改进，最后才试制成功。经过技术鉴定，完全合乎要求，可以投入生产。
