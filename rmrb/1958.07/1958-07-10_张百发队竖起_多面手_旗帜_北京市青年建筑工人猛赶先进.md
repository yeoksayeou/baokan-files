    Zhang Baifa Team Sets Up "All-Rounder" Banner
    Beijing Young Construction Workers Vigorously Catch Up with the Advanced

    (Our report) Under the slogan of "Respect teachers, study diligently and strive for the top, be proficient in one and capable in many," young construction workers in Beijing, taking the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade as an example, have launched a movement to learn multiple skills. On June 27th, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League convened more than 800 representatives of youth shock brigades, groups, and young workers in the construction industry. The meeting introduced the experience of the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade in learning to be all-rounders and made a resolution to launch a movement to learn multiple skills among young construction workers throughout the city.
    
    The Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Workers Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, based on production needs, began learning multiple skills in 1956. In the past two years, in addition to their own steel bar binding techniques, the entire team has learned twelve skills, including operating winches, using mixers, pouring concrete, blacksmithing, ramming lime soil, tying scaffolding, installing plumbing and heating, electric welding, and gas welding. Each person has learned an average of five or six skills. Because they have learned multiple skills, they have not only avoided idling in the past two years, but also increased labor productivity and accelerated construction progress.
    
    The bright red banner of the Zhang Baifa Youth Shock Brigade has greatly promoted the ideological emancipation of young construction workers and strengthened their determination to become all-rounders. They have responded to the call of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League with practical actions, determined to "learn from Baifa, catch up with Baifa." According to statistics from the Beijing No. 2, No. 3, and No. 5 Construction Engineering Companies, and the Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the People's Liberation Army, 123 youth shock brigades have already formulated plans to "learn from Baifa, catch up with Baifa" and advance towards becoming all-rounders. The Wang Nengcong Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company emphasized the need to learn from the Zhang Baifa team's strong sense of ownership, actively strive for all possible learning opportunities, and overcome various difficulties in learning. They have set a plan to learn seven skills, including butt welding, spot welding, electric welding, furnace baking, sheet metal, cement, and lime soil, within a year and a half, and stated: "We will never give up until we become all-rounders!" The Yu Yuanxiang Carpentry Youth Shock Brigade of the Fourth Construction Site of the Construction Engineering Company Directly Under the People's Liberation Army criticized the past conservative idea that "it's impossible to digest too much at once," and further determined the principle of "closely combining with production, learning whatever is needed," planning to learn seven skills this year, including painting, steel reinforcement, cement, glass, lime soil, oil felt, and fitter work. From July 3rd, they have already started doing painting work. Many other youth shock brigades are also catching up with full energy. Many young workers in the No. 3 and No. 5 Construction Engineering Companies, who already have mastered more than two skills, have decided to learn several more. The Liu Denglian Plumbing Youth Shock Brigade of the Fourth Engineering Office of the Ministry of Electric Power was transferred to undertake the riveting work of eight sluice gates. Although only one person in the team knew a little bit about riveting techniques, they learned while working, worked hard for seven days, completed the task, and also learned the technology. They proposed a plan to learn four skills, including furnace baking, sheet metal, electric welding, and arc welding, before October 1st. They have already signed teaching and learning contracts and started learning operation methods.
    
    At present, the Zhang Baifa Shock Brigade is still leading the way in the ranks of advancing towards "all-rounders," and they are learning more skills. Zhang Baifa said with full confidence: "We want to learn all the skills of building houses and also engage in inventions and creations. When that time comes, we can do whatever we want. Wouldn't that be the communist society?" (Attached picture)

    张百发队竖起“多面手”旗帜
    北京市青年建筑工人猛赶先进
    本报讯  在“尊师苦学争上游，精一兼数多面手”的口号下，北京市建筑业青年工人以张百发青年突击队为榜样，展开了学习多种技术的运动。6月27日，北京团市委召集了建筑业青年突击队、组和青年工人的代表八百多人开会，介绍了张百发青年突击队学习多面手的经验，并且作出了在全市青年建筑工人中开展学习多种技术运动的决议。
    北京市第三建筑工程公司张百发钢筋工青年突击队，根据生产的需要，从1956年开始学多种技术。两年多来，除了本行的扎钢筋技术外，全队学会了开卷扬机、用搅拌机、打混凝土、打铁、打灰土、绑脚手架、安装水暖、电焊、汽焊等十二种技术，每人平均学会五、六种。由于学会了多种技术，两年多以来，他们不但没有窝过工，而且提高了劳动生产率，加快了施工进度。
    张百发青年突击队这面鲜红的旗帜，大大促进了青年建筑工人的思想解放，增强了他们学成多面手的决心。他们纷纷以实际行动响应团市委的号召，决心“学百发，赶百发”。根据北京市第二、第三、第五建筑工程公司和解放军直属建筑工程公司等四个公司的统计，已经有一百二十三个青年突击队订出了“学百发、赶百发”向多面手进军的规划。北京市第二建筑工程公司王能聪青年突击队强调要学习张百发队具有的强烈的当家作主的思想，主动争取一切可能学习的机会和克服学习中的种种困难的精神。他们订出在一年半内学会对焊、点焊、电焊、烘炉、白铁、水泥、灰土等七种技术的规划，并且表示：“不学成多面手决不罢休！”解放军直属建筑工程公司四工地于元祥木工青年突击队，批判了过去认为“贪多嚼不烂”的保守思想，并且进一步确定了“紧密结合生产，作啥学啥”的原则，计划今年学会油漆、铁筋、水泥、玻璃、灰土、油毡、钳工等七种技术。从7月3日起，他们已开始干油漆活了。还有不少青年突击队也干劲十足地急起直追。像第三、第五建筑工程公司的许多青年工人，本来掌握了两种以上技术，他们决定再多学几种技术。电力部第四工程处的刘登连水暖工青年突击队被调去承担八个闸门的铆活。队内虽然只有一个人稍稍懂得点铆工技术，但他们边干边学，苦战七天，完成了任务，也学会了技术。他们提出规划，要在10月1日前学会烘炉、白铁、电焊、弧焊等四种技术。他们已经订了包教保学合同，开始动手学操作方法了。
    目前在向“多面手”进军的行列中领先的仍是张百发突击队，他们正在学习更多的技术。张百发信心百倍地说：“我们要把盖房子的各种手艺统统学会，还要搞发明创造。到那时，我们想干什么，就干什么，那不就到了共产主义社会了吗？”（附图片）
