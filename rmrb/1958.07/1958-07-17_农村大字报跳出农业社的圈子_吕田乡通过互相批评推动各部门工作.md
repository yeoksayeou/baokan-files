Rural Big-Character Posters Break Out of the Agricultural Cooperative Circle
Lütián Township Promotes Work in All Departments Through Mutual Criticism

(Our dispatch) The practice of Guǎngdōng Province's Cónghuà County's Lütián Township extending the use of big-character posters from agricultural cooperatives to the wider community has played a significant role in resolving internal contradictions among the people in a timely manner and promoting communist-style collaboration between departments.

The township's application of big-character posters and cartoons to the wider society began in May, after the rural rectification and commune consolidation movement. Initially, members of the Shīxiàng Cooperative, seeing that the seedlings of the Lǚzhōng Cooperative were growing poorly, posted a big-character poster for them: "Lǚzhōng Cooperative members should strive for excellence; your cooperative is located by the highway; if production is not done well, the relationship between cooperatives will be affected." From then on, big-character posters developed from internal criticism and suggestions within cooperatives to exchanges between cooperatives, between rural and urban areas, between departments, and between rural and urban residents. Many of the big-character posters criticized the shortcomings in the work and service attitude of town-based government units. In early June, the township's grassroots Party committee collected these big-character posters and held an exhibition in Lǚtián Market, mobilizing more than four thousand people from the entire township to visit. After that, big-character posters became even more popular. Not only were agricultural cooperatives in rural areas covered with big-character posters, but also the offices, enterprises, stores, and even residential doors in Lǚtián Market were plastered with big-character posters. According to statistics, from May to early July, more than 63,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the township, an average of five posters per person.

As a result of mutual criticism through big-character posters, internal contradictions among the people were resolved in a timely and effective manner. The medical staff of the Lütián Health Center originally had a very poor mass perspective; they were not only unwilling to go to the countryside to provide medical treatment, but they also did not open until 10:00 a.m. every day. They also took a two-hour break at noon and closed their doors to visitors at 4:00 p.m. In the past, the masses made many verbal suggestions, but they were ineffective. This time, everyone posted three big-character posters and drew a cartoon for the health center. The cartoon depicted a doctor lying in bed, with the clock on the wall pointing to after 9:00 a.m., but several sick farmers outside the door were anxiously waiting. This kind of social pressure formed by criticism finally led the health center to change its work style. Now, they open at 6:30 a.m. every day and stay open until 7:30 p.m. Rural patients can call for appointments and they will come whenever they are needed, rain or shine, day or night, which the farmers are very satisfied with. The Lütián Post and Telecommunications Office used to deliver newspapers late, and newspapers ordered for remote areas would be handed over to nearby agricultural cooperatives for redistribution halfway, and these newspapers often took three or four days to reach subscribers. Recently, after the Dōngkēng, Xiǎoshān, Sāncūn, and Tángjī agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas posted big-character posters to the post and telecommunications office, the postal workers delivered the newspapers directly to subscribers.

After many departments exchanged opinions, the previous phenomena of mutual disconnection and buck-passing have been replaced by mutual cooperation and comprehensive collaboration. The relationship between the Liánmá Cooperative and the Lǚzhōng Cooperative has improved in this way. Originally, the Liánmá Cooperative did not have limestone for making lime and had to rely on the Lǚzhōng Cooperative for supply. The two cooperatives signed a purchase and sale contract, but the Lǚzhōng Cooperative often failed to deliver on time. Therefore, the Liánmá Cooperative had a lot of complaints about the Lǚzhōng Cooperative. This time, after the big-character posters were posted, the cadres of the two cooperatives discussed a solution that was beneficial to both parties. The Sāncūn, Guìfēng, and Liánfēng cooperatives were neighboring cooperatives in a tripod-like relationship. In the past, there was no road to Lǚtián Market, and transportation was very inconvenient. However, if only one cooperative were to build the road, it would not only lack the strength, but also would not be mutually beneficial. After the big-character poster movement was launched, members of each cooperative posted big-character posters, suggesting that the three cooperatives jointly build a road. Qiū Yángqí, the secretary of the township's grassroots Party committee, read these big-character posters and summoned the cadres of the three cooperatives to discuss jointly, adopting a method of collaboration between the three cooperatives, dividing the entire road into three sections, with each cooperative responsible for building one section. The road construction project started quickly and is now one-third completed.

In order to make this big-character poster movement, which has just been extended to the society, more widely and frequently carried out, and to become a driving force for improving the work of all departments and transforming social customs, the township's grassroots Party committee has decided to open four platforms for posting big-character posters in Lǚtián Market and in all agricultural cooperatives in the township: one called "Challenge Arena," dedicated to posting challenges, competitions, and debates; one called "Hall of Glory," dedicated to posting commendations for good people and good deeds; another is specifically for posting exposures of work shortcomings, bad phenomena, and bad people and bad deeds; one called "Zhuge Liang Platform," dedicated to posting suggestions and proposals. Now Lǚtián Market has started, and the rural cooperatives are also preparing.

### 农村大字报跳出农业社的圈子  吕田乡通过互相批评推动各部门工作

    农村大字报跳出农业社的圈子
    吕田乡通过互相批评推动各部门工作
    本报讯　广东省从化县吕田乡把大字报从农业合作社扩展到社会上去，对及时解决人民内部矛盾，促进部门之间的共产主义大协作，起了很大作用。
    这个乡把大字报、漫画应用到社会上来，是从5月间农村整风整社后开始的。最先，狮象社的社员，看见吕中社的禾苗生长得差，就给他们贴了一张大字报：“吕中社员要争先，你社住在公路边，若然生产搞不好，社社关系有相连。”从此，大字报就由社内互相批评、提意见，发展到社与社之间，农村与城镇之间，部门与部门之间，以及农村居民与城镇居民之间。大字报中，很多是批评镇上机关单位的工作缺点和服务态度的。6月初，该乡基层党委会把这些大字报收集起来，在吕田墟上开了一个展览会，发动全乡四千多人去参观。之后，大字报就更加广泛地风行起来。不但农村的合作社里，到处都贴满了大字报，而且，在吕田墟的机关、企业、商店以至居民住宅的门口，都贴上了大字报。据统计，从5月到7月初，全乡共贴出了大字报六万三千多张，平均每人写了五张。
    通过大字报互相批评的结果，及时而有效地解决了人民内部矛盾。吕田卫生所的医务人员的群众观点原来很差，不但不肯下乡诊病，而且每天要到十点钟才开门应诊。中午还要休息两个钟头，下午四点钟就闭门谢客。过去群众口头提了许多意见，都不见效，这次大家给这个卫生所贴了三张大字报，并且画了一张漫画。漫画上画着医生高枕而卧，墙壁上的时钟的指针已经指到九点多，可是，门外几个患病的农民还在焦急地引颈等望。这种批评形成的社会舆论力量，终于使这个卫生所改变了工作作风。现在，他们每天从早上六点半钟就开门应诊，一直到下午七点半。农村里的病人只要来电话约诊，不论雨天黑夜，都随叫随到，农民很满意。吕田邮电所以前送报不及时，对偏远地方订的报纸，送到半途便交给附近的农业社代转，这些报纸往往要三四天才能送到订户手上。最近山区里的东坑、小杉、三村、塘基等农业社给邮电所贴了大字报后，邮递员便把报纸直接送到订户手上。
    许多部门经过互相提意见后，过去存在的相互脱节、相互扯皮的现象已经为互相合作、全面协作所代替。连麻社同吕中社的关系，就是这样改善的。原来连麻社没有石灰石烧石灰，要靠吕中社供应，两社订了购销合同，但吕中社经常不按时交货。因此，连麻社对吕中社很有意见。这回大字报一贴，两个社的干部便商定了一个对双方都有利的解决办法。三村、桂峰、联丰等三个社是形同鼎足的毗邻社，过去没有公路通往吕田墟，交通很不方便。但如果只由一个社兴筑，不但力量不够，而且也不互利。开展大字报运动后，各社的社员都贴出了大字报，建议三社合筑一条公路。该乡基层党委书记丘杨其看了这些大字报，就召集这三个社的干部共同商量，采取三社协作的办法，把整个公路划分三段，每社负责筑一段。筑路工程很快就开始了，现已完成了三分之一。
    为了使这个刚刚扩展到社会上来的大字报运动，能够更广泛、经常地开展，成为改进一切部门工作、转变社会风气的一种推动力量，该乡基层党委已经决定在吕田墟和全乡各个农业社开辟四个张贴大字报的台：一个叫“打擂台”，专门张贴挑战、竞赛和辩论的；一个叫“光荣台”，专门张贴表扬好人好事的；另一个是专门张贴揭露工作缺点、不良现象和坏人坏事的；一个叫“诸葛亮台”，专门张贴献计、提建议的。现在吕田墟已动手进行，农村各社也在准备中。
