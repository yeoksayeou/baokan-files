Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Comrade Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, expressed important opinions on the issue of work-study programs in higher and secondary schools at a recent symposium held by the Ministry of Education. The symposium was convened by the Ministry of Education on the 8th and 9th, attended by more than 100 cadres from nearly 80 higher and secondary vocational schools from Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces, who came to Beijing to visit the "Beijing Higher Education Institutions and Secondary Vocational Schools Red and Expert Leap Forward Exhibition."

Before attending the symposium, Comrade Kang Sheng spent three evenings carefully viewing every exhibit at the exhibition. At the symposium, Comrade Kang Sheng first spoke about his impressions after visiting the exhibition. He said: "The work-study activities of various schools in Beijing over the past four months have achieved great results. The exhibition shows that under the leadership of the Party Committee, the vast majority of students and some teachers firmly support the Party's policy of combining education and productive labor, and everyone is very enthusiastic in implementing this policy. From the exhibition, we can see that after the Party strengthened its leadership over the schools, the work of the schools has made significant progress. The exhibition also shows that the student masses and young teachers are truly bold in thinking and doing, breaking down superstitions, and liberating their minds. This kind of ideological liberation has turned into vigorous practical action. The exhibition has enhanced our confidence in implementing the Party's education policy and powerfully shattered the right-wing elements' slander that university students are 'not as good as before' and that the Communist Party cannot lead science and education." Comrade Kang Sheng said: "This policy of combining education and productive labor will inevitably greatly promote students' political and ideological progress and physical education progress, which is not doubted by everyone. However, whether this policy can improve or lower the quality of intellectual education, that is, the quality of teaching and scientific research, was doubted by many people at the beginning. The exhibition powerfully answered this question, proving that this education policy will greatly improve the quality of teaching and scientific research."

Comrade Kang Sheng, based on the profound impressions the exhibition gave him, put forward some important opinions on the issue of work-study programs. He said: "It is a major event for schools to run factories. After proposing the call for work-study programs, and after everyone's exploration in practice over the past few months, it has now entered a new stage, finding a way, a concrete form of combination, and a bright road for combining education and productive labor. Universities, secondary vocational schools, and even ordinary middle schools can adopt the form of schools running factories to solve the problem of combining education and productive labor. It seems that all schools must take this path. Conversely, in the future, factories must also run schools. This is the general trend of education in our country in the future, a good way to realize the intellectualization of the working people and the laborization of intellectuals, gradually combining physical and mental labor, and also preparing concrete conditions for a communist society." Comrade Kang Sheng said: "It is still necessary for schools to be linked with factories and rural areas outside the school in the future. By contacting the broad masses of workers and peasants, they can strengthen their political and ideological training and learn more complex and extensive production knowledge. However, schools running their own factories provide more initiative in combining majors, arranging study time, and formulating teaching plans, and provide a material guarantee for improving teaching quality and scientific research quality."

Comrade Kang Sheng said: "From the exhibition, it can be seen that the method of schools running factories also implements the spirit of the Party's general line: large, medium, and small factories should be developed simultaneously, indigenous and foreign methods should be combined, improvement and popularization should be combined, and comprehensiveness and specialization should be combined. The main and large number of factories are established by relying on self-reliance and starting from scratch. Many schools use the income from production mainly for investment to expand reproduction, which is beneficial to the country, the school, and the students, and basically solves the distribution problem. This is another creation of the masses. Some schools propose self-sufficiency, which is also a good thing. Schools accumulate funds from savings and production income investment, as well as other methods, to set up factories, which opens up the broadest road for schools of all conditions across the country to run their own factories. The state can not deduct the school's savings and production income from the budget, which can stimulate the school's enthusiasm for running factories. Now the school Party Committee must also manage the economy in addition to politics, because politics and economy are inherently inseparable!"

At this exhibition, the teaching syllabus collectively compiled by students of Beijing Normal University was displayed. Comrade Kang Sheng believed that this was a remarkable and good thing, a pioneering work in the mass line in teaching. Comrade Kang Sheng said: "Even if this matter has shortcomings or even fails, the direction is correct, and the spirit is good. A 'three-way combination' can also be used in compiling the teaching syllabus, that is, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the teaching and research section and the students work together, each compiles their own, and debates with each other. There is unity and struggle in this process, and finally, unity is achieved through evaluation. This may be better than the teaching syllabus written by the teaching and research section behind closed doors." Comrade Kang Sheng continued: "From the exhibition, we can also see that the cadres sent down to the schools are a major and valuable force. They go down to factories or rural areas, help farmers run factories, improve agricultural tools, run schools..., there are many majors here, and they have a wide range of contacts among the working people, and they are making rapid progress. They bring culture, technology, and science down to the countryside, teachers go down to the countryside (to eliminate illiteracy and run schools), and bring technology, science, and culture to the countryside. Whether the book knowledge of intellectuals is useful depends on whether it is combined with production practice and the working people. If it is combined, it will become very useful, otherwise it will not be very useful. This point is also very prominent in the exhibition. It is hoped that the Party Committees of various schools will strengthen their leadership and assistance to the cadres sent down."

Comrade Kang Sheng finally mentioned that there are many new products at the exhibition that have reached and exceeded the international advanced level. He said: "This is because science and production have implemented the mass line under the leadership of the Party, and the broad masses are combined with technical experts. This fully confirms the truth that Chairman Mao said that theory comes from the masses and from practice. The wisdom of the masses is fully expressed through the exhibits. As long as our entire Party runs science and the entire people run science, I believe that we will definitely be able to catch up with the world level in science in a short period of time."

At this symposium, the schools exchanged experiences in work-study programs. Nanjing University, Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization School, Shenyang Pharmaceutical Industry School, Shenyang Agricultural College, Nankai University, Nanjing Institute of Technology, and Dalian Institute of Technology reported on the situation of their respective work-study activities at the meeting. The Ministry of Education and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly proposed to hold a national exhibition of Red and Expert Leap Forward for higher and secondary vocational schools before the National Day in October this year, and asked all localities to consider and prepare for it.

    勤工俭学进入新阶段
    康生同志在一次座谈会上指出：学校办工厂使教育与生产劳动相结合找到了具体形式
    新华社11日讯　在最近教育部召开的一次座谈会上，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志就高等、中等学校的勤工俭学问题，发表了重要的意见。这次座谈会是教育部在8、9两日召集的，参加座谈的有从辽宁、江苏、河北三省来北京参观“北京市高等学校和中等专业学校红专跃进展览会”的近八十所高等和中等专业学校干部一百多人。
    康生同志在出席这次座谈会前，曾花了三个晚上的时间，详细观看了展览会的每件展品。在座谈会上，康生同志首先讲了参观展览会后的印象。他说：“北京各学校四个月来的勤工俭学活动成绩很大。展览会显示出各学校在党委领导下，绝大多数学生和部分教师，是坚决拥护党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的，大家贯彻执行这一方针的干劲是很大的，从展览会上看到，党加强对学校的领导后，学校工作有显著的进步。展览会也显示出学生群众和青年教师真正是敢想敢干、破除迷信、思想解放了。这种思想解放已变成了生气勃勃的实际行动。展览会提高了我们贯彻执行党的教育方针的信心。有力地粉碎了右派分子所谓大学生“今不如昔”，共产党不能领导科学教育的谰言。康生同志说：“教育与生产劳动相结合的这一方针必然大大促进学生政治思想进步和体育上的进步，这在大家是没有怀疑的。然而这一方针对智育方面，即对教学和科学研究的质量方面，到底能提高还是会降低，这在开始时，许多人是有怀疑的。展览会十分有力地回答了这一问题，证明了这一教育方针会大大提高教学质量与科学研究工作的质量。”
    康生同志从展览会给他的深刻印象，对勤工俭学问题提出了一些重要意见。他说：“各学校开办工厂是件大事情，提出勤工俭学号召以后，经过大家几个月来在实践中摸索，现已进入一个新的阶段，使教育与生产劳动相结合找到门路、具体结合形式和一条光明大道。大学、中等专业学校以至普通中学，都可以采用学校办工厂这种形式来解决教育与生产劳动相结合的问题。看来，所有学校都必须走这条路。反过来，今后工厂也必须办学校。这是今后我国教育的总趋势，是实现知识分子劳动化，劳动人民知识化的好办法，使体力劳动和脑力劳动逐渐结合，也是为共产主义社会准备具体条件。”康生同志说：“学校将来跟校外的工厂农村挂钩仍然是必要的，在和广大的工人农民群众接触中，可以加强政治思想的锻炼和学习更复杂更广泛的生产知识。但学校自己办工厂，却给予结合专业、安排学习时间、制订教学计划等以更主动的条件，为提高教学质量和科学研究质量提供了物质保证。”
    康生同志说：“从展览会看出学校办工厂的方法也贯彻了党的总路线的精神：大中小厂并举，土洋并举，提高与普及并举，综合与专业并举。主要的和大量的工厂是依靠自力更生，白手起家办起来的。许多学校把生产收入所得，主要用作投资扩大再生产，这对国家、学校、学生三者都有利，基本上解决了分配问题，这是群众的又一个创造。有些学校提出自给，这也是一件好事。学校从节约和生产收入投资，以及用其他办法积资，来兴办工厂，为全国各种条件的学校自办工厂开辟了最广阔的道路。国家对学校的节约和生产收入可以不从预算中扣除，这样可以刺激学校办工厂的积极性。现在学校党委会除了管政治，也要管经济，因为政治和经济本来就是分不开的！”
    在这次展览会上，展出了北京师范大学学生集体编写的教学大纲，康生同志认为这是一件了不起的好事情，是教学工作上走群众路线的创举。康生同志说：“这件事情即使有缺点甚至失败了，但这方向是对的，精神也是好的。在编教学大纲上也可来个三结合，即在党委领导下，教研室和学生一齐动手，各人编出来，相互展开辩论，这当中有团结，斗争，最后经过评比达到一致的团结。这就可能比教研室关门写的教学大纲更好些。”康生同志接着说：“从展览会上还可以看到：学校下放干部是一支主要的可贵的力量。他们下放到工厂或农村，帮农民办工厂，改良农具，办学校……，这里有许多专业，在劳动人民中他们接触面很广，进步也很快，他们人下乡，同时带来文化下乡，技术下乡，科学下乡，教师下乡（扫盲、办学校），把技术、科学、文化都带下了乡。知识分子的书本知识，有没有用处，关键在于是否和生产实践和劳动人民相结合，结合起来就会变得十分有用，否则就没有多大用处。展览会上这点也很突出。希望各学校党委对下放干部要加强领导和帮助。”
    康生同志最后提到展览会上有许多达到和超过国际先进水平的新产品，他说：“这是由于科学和生产在党领导下实行了群众路线，广大群众与技术专家相结合的结果。这又充分证实了毛主席所说的理论是从群众、从实践中来的真理。群众的智慧通过展览品充分地表现出来了。只要我们全党办科学，全民办科学，相信一定可以在短期内使我们的科学赶上世界水平。”
    在这次座谈会上，各校交流了勤工俭学经验。南京大学、南京农业机械化学校、沈阳制药工业学校、沈阳农学院、南开大学、南京工学院、大连工学院等七校在会上汇报了各自开展勤工俭学活动的情况。教育部和共青团中央共同提出，准备在今年10月国庆前举办全国高等和中等专业学校红专跃进展览会，请各地考虑并作准备。
