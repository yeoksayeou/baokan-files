    Corn "Three Attacks" Fertilization Method
    The "Three Attacks" fertilization method is an advanced experience in rational fertilization of corn created by Chinese farmers. In recent years, many places have achieved significant yield increases by using this experience. Hanqi Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, has achieved a summer corn yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for several consecutive years by using the "Three Attacks" fertilization method. The Le Leng Agricultural Cooperative in Cheng County, Gansu Province, which set a new national record of 2,520 jin per mu of spring corn in 1957, also used this fertilization method.
    Corn is a crop with strong fertilizer absorption and great potential for yield increase. Only by increasing the base fertilizer and applying top dressing in stages can we meet its nutrient needs throughout the entire growth period and fully exploit its high-yield performance. According to scientific research and analysis: corn absorbs the most fertilizer during the period from jointing to flowering. The so-called "Three Attacks" fertilization method is to attack the seedlings, attack the stalks, and attack the ears. This is to supply the nutrients needed for corn to grow seedlings, stalks, and ears in a timely manner according to the different growth and development stages of corn. Therefore, this fertilization method is completely in line with scientific principles.
    When should the "Three Attacks" fertilization be carried out? Generally, the first top dressing is applied when the corn seedlings are seven or eight inches tall to attack the seedlings; the second top dressing is applied when the seedlings are more than two feet tall during the jointing stage to attack the stalks; and the third top dressing is applied when the plants are six or seven feet tall during the tasseling stage to attack the ears. Each fertilization is generally combined with irrigation and cultivation to fully exert the fertilizer effect.
    The type and quantity of top dressing can be determined according to the specific situation. The fertilizers commonly used are: decomposed manure, kang soil, oil cake, human manure, and chemical fertilizers.
    In terms of fertilization technology, we should promote the experience of concentrated fertilization inherent in the masses—applying fertilizer near the roots of corn, three or four inches away from the plant, by opening holes or ditches, and then covering the soil after application. The advantage of doing so is that it saves fertilizer and improves fertilizer efficiency. The depth of fertilization is generally around two inches (five or six centimeters). According to experiments conducted by the Hebei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in this area: during the corn growth period (in rainy, humid soil conditions), applying fertilizer at a depth of five centimeters can increase yield by 7.2% compared to three centimeters, increase yield by 3.2% compared to seven centimeters, and increase yield by 5.7% compared to nine centimeters. Therefore, in general areas with irrigation conditions, a depth of five centimeters is more suitable, while in dry land, a depth of about seven centimeters is more suitable.
    This year, in order to realize the great leap forward in production, many places have actively expanded the planting area of corn. The growth of corn and the level of yield are directly related to whether the task of increasing grain production this year can be completed. Now is the peak period of corn growth. Grasp the important link of top dressing to increase production, adopt the advanced experience of "Three Attacks" fertilization, and we can do a better job of top dressing corn.

### 玉米“三攻”施肥法

    玉米“三攻”施肥法
    “三攻”施肥法是我国农民所创造的玉米合理施肥的先进经验。近年来许多地方由于采用了这个经验，也获得显著增产效果。河南省偃师县韩旗农业社因为采用“三攻”施肥法，连续几年获得夏玉米亩产千斤的丰产纪录。1957年创造春玉米亩产二千五百二十斤全国最高新纪录的甘肃省成县乐棱农业社，也是因为采用了这种施肥方法。
    玉米是一种吸肥力强，增产潜力大的作物。只有在增施基肥的基础上，分期追肥，才能满足它生长全期对养料的需要，也才能充分发挥它的高产性能。根据科学研究分析：玉米在拔节到开花期间吸收肥料最多。所谓“三攻”施肥方法就是攻苗、攻秆、攻穗。这是按照玉米不同生长发育阶段，及时地供给玉米长苗、长秆、长穗所需要的养料。所以这种施肥方法是完全合乎科学道理的。
    “三攻”施肥，要在什么时期进行呢？一般在玉米苗高七、八寸的时候进行第一次追肥，用以攻苗；在苗高二尺多的拔节期，进行第二次追肥，用以攻秆；在植株高六、七尺的抽穗期，进行第三次追肥，用以攻穗。每次施肥一般都结合进行灌溉和中耕，以充分发挥肥效。
    追肥的种类和数量可视具体情况来决定。通常采用的肥料是：腐熟的厩肥、炕土、油饼、人粪尿和化学肥料等。
    在施肥技术上，应该提倡群众中固有的集中施肥的经验——在玉米根旁三、四寸的地方开穴或开沟按株追施，施后复土。这样做的好处是既能节省肥料又能提高肥效。施肥的深度一般在二寸（五、六公分）左右。据河北省农业科学研究所在这一方面的试验：在玉米生育期间（多雨、土壤湿润的情况下），施五公分深的比三公分深的可增产7.2％，比施七公分深的增产3.2％，比施九公分深的增产5.7％。因此，在一般有灌溉条件的地区施五公分深较适宜，旱地则以施七公分左右为适宜。
    今年许多地方，为了实现生产大跃进，积极地扩大了玉米种植面积，玉米生长好坏，产量高低，直接关系到今年粮食增产任务能否完成。现在正是玉米生长的盛期，紧紧抓住追肥这个增产的重要环节，采用“三攻”施肥的先进经验，才能把玉米的追肥工作做得更好。
