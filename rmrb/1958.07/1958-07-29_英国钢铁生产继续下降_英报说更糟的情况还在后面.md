Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th: Currently, the operating rate of the entire British steel industry is less than 80%. In the past six months, production has decreased by about 6%, and exports have decreased by 13%. This news was reported in today's "Financial Times." The newspaper also said, "Indications suggest that worse is yet to come."

The quarterly "Steel Review" published today by the British Iron and Steel Federation reveals that Britain has a large surplus of steel products, "reflecting a decrease in domestic and foreign demand."

The magazine predicts that, for at least the next year, British steel production "will probably continue to be significantly below production capacity."

    英国钢铁生产继续下降
    英报说更糟的情况还在后面
    新华社伦敦28日电　目前英国整个钢铁工业生产的开工率不到80％。在过去六个月中，生产降低了大约6％，出口减少了13％。这个消息是今天的“金融时报”报道的。这家报纸又说，“迹象表明，更糟的情况还在后面。”
    今天出版的英国钢铁业联合会的季刊“钢铁评论”透露说，英国有着大量的钢铁剩余产品，“这反映出国内外需求的减少”。
    这家杂志预料，至少在今后一年内，英国的钢铁生产“大概将继续大大低于生产能力”。
