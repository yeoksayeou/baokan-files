Efforts to Scale the Heights of Science and Technology

    Successful Trial Production of Nickel-Free Stainless Steel
    Resistance to Concentrated Nitric Acid and Intergranular Corrosion Exceeds US Standards
    After ten days of arduous effort, scientific workers from the Alloy Steel Group of the Institute of Metals, Chinese Academy of Sciences, successfully trial-produced nickel-free stainless steel. The resistance of this nickel-free stainless steel to concentrated nitric acid corrosion is already close to that of nickel-containing stainless steel. Its resistance to concentrated nitric acid corrosion and intergranular corrosion both exceed the quality of American nickel-free stainless steel, reaching world-class standards.
    China currently lacks nickel resources. In the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, there is an urgent need for large quantities of chemical fertilizers and artificial fibers. Whether chemical fertilizers and artificial fibers can be produced in large quantities hinges on stainless steel materials, and the main component of stainless steel is nickel. Therefore, the research and development of nickel-free stainless steel can greatly promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    The research work on nickel-free stainless steel began in March of this year. At that time, due to the unclear research tasks, the preliminary plan was to complete it within three years. However, in the high tide of the nationwide Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and under the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with Britain in a short period, the research direction also underwent a major transformation. It was decided to break with the old academic research methods of the past, taking the task as a prerequisite, producing new steel grades, and then elevating them to theoretical summaries through practice. This initiative received the support and encouragement of the Party organization of the institute. Trial production of stainless steel is a complex task involving many processes. According to past time estimates, it would take at least three months to go through a series of processes such as steelmaking, forging, rolling, heat treatment, making specimens, and conducting corrosion tests. However, the comrades of the research group broke with conventions and old rules, and everyone went all out, went to the factory to cooperate with the workers, and personally overcame the difficulties in technical work. Finally, after ten days of hard work, on the evening of June 30, they successfully trial-produced nickel-free stainless steel, and the quality has already surpassed that of American products.

### 无镍不锈钢试制成功  抗浓硝酸和抗晶界腐蚀性能超过美国

    无镍不锈钢试制成功
    抗浓硝酸和抗晶界腐蚀性能超过美国
    中国科学院金属研究所合金钢组的科学工作者经过十天的苦战，试制无镍不锈钢成功。这种无镍不锈钢抗浓硝酸腐蚀性能已经接近含镍不锈钢，它的抗浓硝酸腐蚀及抗晶界腐蚀均已超过美国无镍不锈钢的质量，达到世界水平。
    我国目前缺少镍的资源，在工农业生产大跃进中迫切需用大量化肥及人造纤维，而化肥及人造纤维能否大量生产，关键在于不锈钢材料，而不锈钢的成份主要是镍。所以研究出无镍不锈钢，就能大大推动工农业生产的大跃进。
    无镍不锈钢的研究工作是从今年3月份开始的，当时由于研究任务不明确，初步预订三年内完成。但在全国工农业大跃进的高潮中，以及党中央提出在短期内赶上英国的号召下，研究方向也来了一个大转变，确定打破过去旧学院研究方式，以任务为前提，制出新钢种，经过实践，再提高到理论总结，这个倡议得到该所党组织的支持和鼓励。试制不锈钢是一个工种繁多复杂的工作，照过去的时间估计经过炼钢、锻钢、轧钢、热处理，制成试件、再进行腐蚀试验，这一系列过程至少要三个月。但是，研究组的同志打破了陈规旧律，大家鼓足干劲，下工厂与工人配合，亲自动手，克服了技术工作上的困难，终于经过十天苦战，在6月30日晚上试制出无镍不锈钢，而且质量已经压倒了美国的产品。（沈阳日报）
