    Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th. As it enters the second half of this year, the British economy is being plagued by even more ominous circumstances.
    As soon as the British government's decision to lower bank interest rates as one of its anti-recession measures was announced, the nightmare of the deterioration of the pound's position followed. The bank interest rate had already been lowered for the first time in mid-March from 7% last September (an emergency measure taken to deal with the crisis of gold and dollar reserves) to 6%, and then lowered twice more in May and June, to the current 5%. While these actions were being taken, the value of the pound has shown a downward trend in the financial markets.
    Due to the shrinking trade between capitalist countries, the British shipping situation is deteriorating daily. The Shipping Association announced today that on June 1, 183 British ships were idle, with a total tonnage of 1,033,622 tons. The association pointed out that this is the first time since the early 1930s that the number of idle British ships has exceeded one million tons. Compared with the beginning of this year, the number of idle ships has increased by 103, and the tonnage by approximately 660,000 tons.
    The outlook for the steel industry remains bleak. The huge steel group, Colvilles steel plant, said in a letter to its 18,000 employees that it had no confidence in the future, "We cannot deceive ourselves into thinking that a major crisis is impossible."
    The letter also stated that although production has already been cut, so far it is still "difficult to find orders," and "production at our factories will have to be further reduced." The letter believes that the recession is due to the domestic market's "crisis of clearing inventories" and the American crisis. It said that in the United States, a "real recession" has occurred in the steel industry, and that "to some extent, Britain must be affected by what has recently happened in the United States."

    美国经济危机和国内存货里外夹攻
    英国经济前景更不吉利
    钢铁集团承认对未来没有信心
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国经济在进入今年下半年的时候正受到更多不吉利的情况的困扰。
    作为英国政府反衰退措施之一的降低银行利率的决定一公布，英镑地位恶化的梦魔就接踵而来。银行利率在今年3月中旬已从去年9月的7％第一次降低到6％（这是作为对付黄金和美元储备危机而采取的紧急措施），5月份和6月份又降低了两次，降低到目前的5％。在采取这些行动的同时，英镑价值在金融市场上呈现了一直下跌的趋势。
    由于资本主义各国贸易萎缩，英国航运情况日益恶化。海运协会今天宣布，在6月1日，英国有一百八十三艘船只闲置起来，总吨数达一百零三万三千六百二十二吨。协会指出，自从二十世纪三十年代初期以来，英国闲置船只超过一百万吨这还是第一次。同今年年初比较，闲置船只的数目增加了一百零三艘，吨位约六十六万吨。
    钢铁工业的前景仍然黯淡。规模巨大的钢铁集团考尔维尔钢铁厂在写给它的一万八千名职工的信中说，它没有信心面对未来，“我们不能欺骗自己，认为不可能发生重大的危机”。
    这封信还说，尽管生产已经削减了，但是到现在为止还是“很难找到订货”，“我们工厂的生产还要进一步减少”。这封信认为，衰退是由于国内市场“清除存货的危机”和美国的危机造成的。它说，在美国，钢铁业已经发生了“真正的衰退”，而“在某种程度上，英国一定要受到美国最近发生的事情的影响”。
