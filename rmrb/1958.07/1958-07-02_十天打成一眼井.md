    Drilling a Well in Ten Days

    Yan Jianzhang, the Party Secretary of the Xin Xing Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Lixian County, Hebei Province, is only thirty-four years old this year. He has always been full of vigor and dares to think and act. In the Great Leap Forward in production, he boldly broke the superstition that "it takes several months to drill a mechanized well," and created an advanced example of drilling a mechanized well in ten days, opening up a path for the realization of irrigation mechanization.

    After Yan Jianzhang came up with the leap forward plan for drilling a well, he first discussed it with several village cadres and got their consent. Then, he convened party members, youth league members, production team leaders, and villagers' meetings to discuss it. In the beginning, many people said, "Jianzhang is crazy. How can a mechanized well be drilled in ten days?" Some people also said, "It's good to do this. It used to cost 2,000 yuan to drill a mechanized well; this way it only costs 500 yuan. But who knows..." After everyone's discussion, they reached a consensus.

    Next, Yan Jianzhang mobilized the masses to invest, basically solving the problem of material supply for drilling the well. After the ideological problems and material problems were solved, Comrade Yan Jianzhang personally took command, and worked with everyone day and night without going home. While drilling, they encountered stones. People worked for a day and a half but could not drill through. Jianzhang became anxious. He proposed: The auger we are using now is small and light so the force of the auger is small and the stones do not easily enter the auger tube; if we change to a larger auger, we will definitely be able to solve this problem. People thought it made sense. After installation, they drilled through half a foot of stone in one hour. The people who had been groaning and sighing with faces full of sorrow immediately showed smiles, and their enthusiasm was also sufficient.

    From May 21st to 30th, after ten days of hard work, all three tripod setups completed the task of drilling wells, all with a depth of more than forty zhang, and the sand layers were about eighteen zhang. After pumping continuously for several hours with a water pump, the water level did not show any signs of decline. The appearance of this miracle caused a sensation in Xin Xing Village, and also caused a sensation throughout the county. (Ji Wen)

    十天打成一眼井
    阎建章，是中共河北蠡县辛兴村支部书记，今年才三十四岁。他一贯朝气勃勃，敢想敢为。在生产大跃进中，他大胆地打破了“非几个月不能锥成一眼机井”的迷信，创立了十天打成一眼机井的先进榜样，给实现灌溉机械化开辟了道路。
    阎建章想出了锥机井的跃进计划后，首先和几个村干部商量，得到他们同意后，就先后召开党、团员和生产队长，以及社员大会讨论。开始，好多人说：“建章疯了，十天哪能打成一眼机井？”也有人说：“这么做是好，以前锥一眼机井得二千元；这样作锥一眼只用五百元。可谁知……”经过大家讨论，思想才取得一致。
    接着，阎建章又发动群众投资，基本上解决了打机井的物料供应问题。思想问题和物料问题解决后，阎建章同志便亲自挂帅，白天黑夜不回家，和大家一起干。锥着锥着遇见石头了，人们干了一天半也锥不下去，建章可着了急。他提出：现在使的是小锥，分量轻，锥的劲头就小，石头也就不容易跑到锥管里去；要是换成大锥，就一定能解决这个问题。人们认为有道理，经过安装，一点钟就锥过了半尺厚的石头。原来哼唉叹气、愁容满面的人，立时出现了笑容，干劲也足了。
    从5月21日到30日，他们经过了十天的奋战，三盘架子都完成了锥机井的任务，深度都在四十丈以上，沙层都有十八丈左右。用水泵连着抽几个钟头，水势丝毫不显下降。这个奇迹的出现，轰动了辛兴村，也轰动了全县。　　（冀文）
