Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 3rd: Prince Sihanouk stated in the National Assembly today that he has decided to meet the people's demands and assume the position of Prime Minister. Negotiations are currently underway regarding the composition of the cabinet. He said that the program of his cabinet will be the same as that of the previous government under Sim Var.

Sihanouk then spoke about the issue of Cambodia's relations with neighboring countries, reiterating his willingness to go to Saigon and Bangkok in order to negotiate directly and secretly with the South Vietnamese and Thai authorities to resolve border issues.

Sihanouk said, "As before, I insist on a neutral policy, but neutrality without alliances is dangerous because other countries will gradually encroach upon us." He added, "Without alliances, we cannot even survive."

    西哈努克将出任首相
    新华社金边3日电西哈努克亲王今天在国民议会说，他决定满足人民的要求，出来担任首相的职务。目前正在就内阁的构成进行协商。他说，他的内阁的纲领将同前任沈法内阁的一样。
    西哈努克接着谈到柬埔寨同邻国的关系问题，他重申愿意到西贡和曼谷去，以便同南越和泰国当局直接和秘密地谈判解决边界问题。
    西哈努克说，像以前一样，我坚持中立政策，但是，中立而没有同盟是危险的，因为其他国家会逐渐地侵略我们。他说，没有同盟我们甚至不能生存。
