　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong, the Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Major General Kang Sang-ho, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged the strongest protest to the U.S. side regarding the U.S.'s serious violation of the Armistice Agreement by illegally establishing a missile command and missile base in South Korea. He firmly demanded that the U.S. immediately dismantle the missile base in South Korea, immediately withdraw all new types of weapons, including atomic weapons, illegally brought into South Korea, and withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea.

　　In his speech, Major General Kang Sang-ho pointed out that for five years since the Korean Armistice, the U.S. side has rudely violated the Armistice Agreement by illegally transporting large quantities of war materials into South Korea to expand the Syngman Rhee puppet army. In order to transport new types of weapons into South Korea without any supervision, the U.S. side unilaterally suspended the legal activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea and unilaterally refused to fulfill the provisions of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of importing any reinforcing weapons from outside Korea. In addition, the U.S. side moved the "United Nations Command" to South Korea, reorganized the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into five atomic divisions, and transferred in "Honest John" rocket battalions, transported in 280mm atomic cannons and other new types of weapons, expanded military facilities, and conducted various provocative "military exercises."

　　Kang Sang-ho said that the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly warned the U.S. side about the above-mentioned actions and demanded that the U.S. side stop its provocative actions and withdraw atomic cannons and other new types of weapons from South Korea. Despite this, the U.S. side formally established the "U.S. 4th Missile Command" near Chuncheon, close to the demilitarized zone, on July 4th of this year and established a missile base.

　　Kang Sang-ho said that this action hinders the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and seriously threatens peace in Korea and the Far East. The purpose of the U.S. aggressive bloc in carrying out this provocative action is to attempt to permanently occupy South Korea by force, continue to maintain tension in the Far East, and prepare conditions for launching another aggression.

　　Under the stern protest and condemnation of the Korean-Chinese side, the U.S. side defended its crimes with the same old tune that had already been refuted by the Korean-Chinese side, saying something about "maintaining a relative balance of military power," "for defense," etc., and slandered the Korean-Chinese side, which has always been faithful to the Armistice Agreement.

　　Major General Kang Sang-ho immediately pointed out at the meeting that this clumsy deceptive trick of the U.S. side is absolutely untenable. This baseless excuse can never legitimize the U.S.'s frenzied preparation for a new war in South Korea.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 14th: According to the Korean Central News Agency from Kaesong, Major General Kang Sang-ho, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, today delivered the statement issued by Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on July 12 regarding the U.S.'s violation of the Armistice Agreement by establishing a missile base in South Korea to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

　　In his letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Major General Kang Sang-ho expressed his hope that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would pay attention to the above-mentioned provocative actions of the U.S. side.

    美方非法在南朝鲜建立导弹基地
    朝中方面首席委员提出抗议
    南日外务相抗议声明已转达中立国监察委员会
    新华社平壤14日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在朝中方面建议下举行会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上就美方严重违反停战协定在南朝鲜非法成立导弹司令部，建立导弹基地的罪恶行为向美方提出最强硬的抗议，并且坚决要求美方立即撤消在南朝鲜的导弹基地，立即把非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器等所有的新型武器都撤出南朝鲜，并且把美军从南朝鲜撤出。
    姜尚昊少将在发言中指出，朝鲜停战以后五年来，美方粗暴地违反停战协定，把大批作战物资非法运入南朝鲜，以扩充李承晚伪军。为了不受任何监视地把新型武器运入南朝鲜，美方片面地停止了中立国视察小组在南朝鲜的合法活动，片面拒绝履行停战协定第十三款卯项关于不得自朝鲜境外运入任何增援性武器的规定。另外，美方又把“联合国军司令部”迁来南朝鲜把驻在南朝鲜的美军改编为五单位原子师，并且调来“诚实的约翰”火箭营，运入二百八十公厘口径的原子大炮等各种新型武器，扩大军事设备，以及进行各种挑衅性的“军事演习”。
    姜尚昊说，朝中方面曾经就美方的上述行为多次向美方提出警告，并且要求美方停止挑衅行动，把原子大炮等各种新型武器撤出南朝鲜。尽管如此，美方竟于今年7月4日在靠近非军事区的春川附近正式成立了“美军第四导弹司令部”，建立了导弹基地。
    姜尚昊说，这种行为阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决严重威胁朝鲜和远东的和平。美国侵略集团进行这种挑衅行为的目的是企图用武力永久侵占南朝鲜，继续保持远东紧张局势，为再一次发动侵略准备条件。
    在朝中方面严正的抗议斥责下，美方以它早已被朝中方面驳斥了的老调来为它的罪行辩护，说什么是“为了保持军事力量的相对平衡”，“为了防御等”，并且诬蔑一贯忠实于停战协定的朝中方面。
    姜尚昊少将在会上当即指出美方这种拙劣的骗人伎俩是绝对站不住脚的。这种毫无根据的借口绝不能使美方在南朝鲜疯狂准备新战争的罪行合法化。
    新华社平壤14日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将今天把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日12日就美方违反停战协定在南朝鲜建立导弹基地所发表的声明转达给中立国监察委员会。
    姜尚昊少将在致中立国监察委员会的信中表示希望中立国监察委员会注意美方的上述挑衅行为。
