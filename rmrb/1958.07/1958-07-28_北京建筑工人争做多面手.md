According to the Beijing Daily news, a multi-skilled learning movement has been widely launched in Beijing's construction enterprises. Many construction sites, work types, and teams have formulated plans and guarantees, using all possible conditions to advance towards multiple techniques.

This time, learning multiple skills began on the basis of in-depth ideological education. Before the learning began, many construction sites, in light of their own circumstances, introduced to the broad masses of workers the benefits and necessity of learning multiple skills, so that everyone understood the significance and purpose of learning.

The most widespread learning method in various construction sites is mutual teaching and learning between teams and groups, acting as each other's teachers and apprentices. Li Chongxi and Fu Zhensheng's mixed work team from the Fifth Construction Engineering Company of the city, because it already has bricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, steelworkers, and other types of work, decided that whoever does which work will have the worker of that type of work as the master, and the rest of the work types as apprentices, operating and learning at the same time, striving for the entire team to become an all-around work team capable of doing everything from excavation to decoration. Inviting people in and sending people out are also good methods for learning multiple skills. When the bricklayer Hao Huaru Youth Shock Team from a construction site of the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of the city was learning plastering techniques, they invited two experienced master craftsmen from other groups to the team to provide technical guidance. Many teams also sent some people to study abroad in other groups. This method is not only used between teams, but also between companies.

After a short period of study, many new multi-skilled workers have emerged in various construction units, and they have played a very good role in production.

    北京建筑工人争做多面手
    据北京日报消息　学习多面手运动已经在北京市建筑企业广泛开展起来。许多工地的各工种、各组队都订规划、提保证，利用一切可能的条件向多种技术进军。
    这次学习多种技术，是在深入进行思想教育的基础上开始的。在学习之前，不少工地都结合本单位情况，向广大职工介绍了学习多种技术的好处和必要性，使大家明确了学习的意义和目的。
    各工地最广泛的学习方法是队、组间互教互学，互为师徒。市第五建筑工程公司李崇喜和傅振生两个混合工作队，由于内部已经有瓦、木、抹灰、钢筋等工种，就决定干那种活就以那个工种的工人作师傅，其余工种作徒弟，边操作、边学习，争取全队成为从挖槽到装修全都能干的万能工作队。请进来，派出去，也是学习多种技术的好方法。市第六建筑工程公司一工地瓦工郝化如青年突击队在学抹灰技术的时候，请外组两位老师傅来队作技术指导，许多队组还抽一部分人到外组去留学，这种方法不仅队组之间采用着，公司与公司之间也在采用着。
    经过短时间学习，各建筑单位涌现出许多新的多面手，并且在生产上起了很好的作用。
