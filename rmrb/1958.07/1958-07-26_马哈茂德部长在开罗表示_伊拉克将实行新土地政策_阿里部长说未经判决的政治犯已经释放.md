Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 24th: Cairo's "Al-Ahram" newspaper today published a statement by Iraqi Republic Minister of Justice Mustafa Ali, saying that the situation in Iraq is stable. He said Iraq hopes to receive the support of all Arab countries. The Iraqi Republic has promulgated new laws aimed at serving the interests of the Iraqi people and the entire Arab nation.

　　Mustafa Ali left Cairo at noon today to return to Baghdad after attending the celebrations of the sixth anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution.

　　Delegate, Iraqi Minister of Agriculture Mahmoud, said that the land owned by former Iraqi royal family members has been confiscated, and the government will adopt a new land policy that benefits the people.

　　He said that Iraq's crops are self-sufficient and can export wheat, rice, barley, fruits, and livestock. He said that under the old regime, farmers were exploited, and land ownership was unrestricted. Some landlords owned as much as 750,000 dunams of land (one dunam equals 2,500 square meters). He also said that some of them had seized land by illegal means, and the Iraqi government will deal with it according to law.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 24th: Iraqi Republic Minister of Justice Mustafa Ali told the press here today that all unsentenced political prisoners in Iraq have been immediately released after the revolution. Mustafa Ali said that a special committee has been established to investigate the cases of those detainees who have been sentenced, because the old regime often deliberately treated political prisoners as ordinary criminals.

　　Iraqi Republic Minister of Education Omar said that the revolutionary government will compensate those who were treated unfairly under the old regime.

　　He said that the revolutionary government has arrested all Iraqi politicians who engaged in activities that violated national interests in the past, and the Iraqi Republic authorities are now searching for foreign suspects who may have infiltrated Iraq to serve the imperialists. Some of them have been arrested.

　　According to a Middle East News Agency Baghdad dispatch, the Iraqi Republic is preparing new banknotes and coins to replace the old currency.

　　Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast a statement by Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamal on the evening of the 24th, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be reorganized and consolidated, and capable Iraqi youth will be recruited to participate in the new government's foreign affairs work.

　　Iraqi Republic Radio announced that the Iraqi Petroleum Company said in a report to its headquarters in London on the 24th that the production and transportation of oil abroad are proceeding as usual.
