According to the Liaoning Daily, cities in Liaoning Province have basically achieved self-sufficiency in vegetable supply during the first half of this year. In the past, they relied on a large amount of vegetables from other places, but this year, locally produced spring and summer vegetables have been coming onto the market in a continuous stream, with sufficient quantity, fresh quality, increased varieties, and timely supply. According to statistics from ten cities, from May to early June this year, approximately 78,283 tons of spring vegetables were put on the market, an increase of 35.4% compared to the same period last year, with an average increase of two ounces of vegetables consumed per person per day compared to last year. Shenyang City, which used to have the most strained vegetable supply, can also meet the demand for vegetables in spring and summer. Compared with the same period last year, the amount of vegetables put on the market in the city increased by 50% in May and 100% in June. In early June, the amount of bok choy alone put on the market every day was more than four times that of the same period last year. In May, when spring vegetables first came down, residents of Jinzhou and Lushun cities could eat more than eight ounces of vegetables per person per day, three to four ounces more than in the same period last year. There has also been an increase in varieties compared to previous years. Rare vegetables such as cauliflower, fresh ginger, and onions, which have never been produced in Liaoning Province before, have also begun to be grown on a large scale, and many people have tasted the delicious and inexpensive cauliflower that was harvested for the first time in the spring.

The reason why the vegetable supply in various cities in Liaoning has been so greatly improved this year is mainly because party and government leaders at all levels have attached importance to vegetable production and resolutely and conscientiously implemented the central government’s policy of "local production and sales as the main focus, supplemented by inter-provincial adjustment," and "near cities and near industrial and mining areas, increasing the production of vegetables and other non-staple foods to meet the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas should be regarded as an important task."

    辽宁各城市蔬菜基本自给
    据辽宁日报消息  辽宁省今年上半年城市蔬菜供应已基本实现自给。往年靠外地大量进菜，今年当地生产的春夏菜源源上市，数量充足，质量鲜嫩，品种增多，供应及时。据十个市统计，今年从5月到6月上旬，上市的春菜约有七万八千二百八十三吨，比去年同时期增加35.4％，平均每人每天比去年多吃二两菜。一向是蔬菜供应最紧张的沈阳市，春夏两季的蔬菜也能满足供应，今年全市上市的蔬菜量同去年相比，5月份增加50％，6月份增加100％；在6月上旬，每天上市的蔬菜光小白菜就比去年同时期上市的小白菜多四倍多。在春菜刚下来的5月份，锦州、旅大市的居民每人每天可以吃到八两多菜，比去年同时期多吃三、四两。在品种方面也比往年有所增加，过去辽宁省从未生产过的菜花、鲜姜、洋葱等稀有蔬菜也开始大量试种了，并且有很多人在春季已经尝到了首次收获的味美价廉的菜花。
    今年辽宁各城市蔬菜供应情况所以能够有这样大的改进，主要原因是各地党政领导重视了蔬菜生产，坚决、认真地贯彻执行了中央提出的“地产地销为主，外地调剂为辅”，和“城市附近和工矿区附近，应该把增产蔬菜等副食品供应城市和工矿区的需要作为重要任务”的方针。
