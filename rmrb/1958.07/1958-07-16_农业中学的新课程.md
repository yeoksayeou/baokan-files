New Curriculum for Agricultural Middle Schools
Sun Zhen

The news published in this newspaper today about the Banqiao Township Agricultural Middle School in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, experimenting with granular fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer, and adding new teaching courses, is a noteworthy piece of news.

The addition of these new teaching courses to agricultural middle schools is entirely in line with the current objective needs of China's rural areas. Agricultural middle schools have developed with the great leap forward in agricultural production and the urgent demand of the vast rural youth to learn agricultural science and technology. In general agricultural middle schools, the teaching courses only include politics, language, arithmetic, and agricultural science and technology. These courses are of course very important. However, now that many agricultural cooperatives have established factories, they not only require agricultural middle school students to learn farming techniques, but also require them to learn comprehensive knowledge of soil, fertilizers, etc., and to understand some simple industrial common sense, so as to better serve agricultural production and rural factories. Therefore, adapting to this new situation, it is entirely necessary to add courses with some new knowledge to agricultural middle schools, and to allow students to do some experimental production within the possible scope.

The addition of these new teaching courses to agricultural middle schools will inevitably be conducive to the further consolidation of agricultural middle schools. Because with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, some agricultural middle school students are no longer satisfied with just learning agricultural farming techniques, and they also urgently hope to master more science and technology. Meeting their demands in this regard will greatly improve their learning enthusiasm, enrich the teaching content, and be welcomed by students' parents. The facts in Jiangsu also prove this point: because the agricultural middle school has added new teaching content, the township and community party organizations and the broad masses of people care more about the agricultural middle school than in the past, and the teaching enthusiasm of agricultural middle school teachers and students is also higher than in the past. This new situation is worth great attention.

    农业中学的新课程
    孙振
    今天本报发表的江苏省江阴县板桥乡农业中学试制颗粒肥料和细菌肥料、增加新的教学课程的新闻，是一条很值得注意的消息。
    农业中学增加这些新的教学课程，是完全符合我国农村当前的客观需要的。农业中学是随着农业生产大跃进、广大农村青年迫切要求学习农业科学技术的形势发展起来的。在一般的农业中学中，教学课程只有政治、语文、算术和农业科学技术等课程。这些课程当然很重要。但是，当很多农业社已经开办了工厂的今天，他们就不只是要求农业中学的学生学会耕作技术，也要求他们学会土壤、肥料等方面的全面知识，并且要懂得一些简单的工业常识，以便更好地为农业生产和为农村的工厂服务。因此，适应这种新的情况，在农业中学中增加一些新知识的课程，并在可能范围内让学生作一些实验性的生产，这是完全必要的。
    农业中学增加这些新的教学课程，必然有利于农业中学的进一步巩固。因为随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，有些农业中学的学生，也已经不满足于仅仅学习农业耕作技术，他们还迫切希望掌握更多的科学技术。满足了他们在这方面的要求，就会大大提高他们的学习情绪，就会丰富教学内容，也会受到学生家长的欢迎。江苏的事实也证明了这一点：由于农业中学增加了新的教学内容，乡社党组织和广大群众就比过去更加关心农业中学了，农业中学教师和学生的教学热情也比过去更高了。这种新的情况，是值得大大重视的。
