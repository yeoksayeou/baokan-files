    Hangzhou is a city that many international friends once called a symbol of peace. The more than 1.1 million residents living here have warmly received guests from all over the world. When the butcher knives of American and British imperialism reached the Middle East, and world peace was threatened, the indignation of the people of Hangzhou was as unstoppable as a raging sea.

    In recent days, more than 500,000 residents have angrily rushed to the streets to demonstrate and hold protest rallies. As night falls, tens of thousands of angry people on the streets still raise their iron fists and roar, "Yankee and British aggressors, get out of the Middle East!"

    In factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhoods, anger burns day and night. Miao Shouchun, an old worker in the heat treatment workshop of the Hangzhou Tractor Factory, suffered the pain of unemployment under the reactionary rule of the American and Chiang Kai-shek clique before liberation. The aggression of American and British imperialism in the Middle East made him extremely angry. In order to enhance the power to strike at imperialism and defend world peace, he sweated profusely in the high temperature of over 100 degrees, insisted on working all night, and finally produced the factory's first furnace of steel. Miao Shouchun proudly said, "We must make the imperialists tremble before us!"

    Yan Xuehai, a returned overseas Chinese student from Malaysia in the first year of high school at Hangzhou No. 2 Middle School, was even more angry because his family suffered all kinds of persecution under British imperialist colonial rule. His second brother and younger sister were brutally beaten to death, and his entire family of eight was arrested and imprisoned for no reason, and their houses and property were all burned down. He said to his classmates: "I have lived under the enslavement of imperialism in the past, and I can best understand the suffering of the colonial people. I must firmly stand at the forefront of opposing imperialist aggression." He and his classmates wrote slogans overnight and participated in protest rallies and demonstrations.

    In Daomao Lane, there is an old lady, Jiang Pingping, who is over half a century old. Her third son heroically sacrificed in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In recent days, Mrs. Jiang has continuously exposed the aggressive crimes of American and British imperialism to her neighbors. She said angrily: "The revenge for the American aggressors killing my son has not yet been avenged, and they are wielding knives and guns in the Middle East again. We must not let them run rampant, and we want American troops to get out of Taiwan." The entire family of eleven, old and young, of Mrs. Jiang are filled with incomparable hatred for the American imperialist aggressors. Even her nine-year-old grandson gritted his teeth and said, "Down with the aggressors, avenge my uncle!"

    The anti-aggression tide on the West Lake is now growing bigger and bigger, higher and higher.

    西子湖畔的反侵略浪涛
    新华社记者　任兆英　伊心恬
    杭州是曾经被许多国际友人称为和平的象征的城市。生活在这里的一百一十多万居民，热情地接待过来自世界各国的客人。当美英帝国主义的屠刀伸到中东，世界和平受到威胁的时候，杭州人民的义愤也像汹涌的海涛一样不可遏止。
    连日来，五十多万居民愤怒地奔向街头，示威游行和举行抗议集会。夜幕降临了，街上成千上万的愤怒人群仍然高举铁拳，发出“美英强盗滚出中东去！”的怒吼声。
    在工厂、机关、学校和里弄中，怒火日夜燃烧着。杭州拖拉机厂热处理车间老工人缪寿春，解放前在美蒋反动统治下受尽了失业的痛苦。美英帝国主义对中东的侵略，使他愤怒无比。为了增强打击帝国主义、保卫世界和平的力量，他在百多度的高温下挥汗如雨，坚持工作通宵，终于炼出了该厂第一炉钢。缪寿春自豪地说：“要让帝国主义在我们面前发抖！”
    杭州市第二中学高中一年级学生、马来亚归侨颜学海更为愤怒，因为他一家人在英帝国主义殖民统治下受尽迫害，二哥和妹妹惨被打死，全家八人无端被捕入狱，房屋财产全被烧光。他对同学说：“过去我在帝国主义奴役下生活过来，最能体会殖民地人民的痛苦，我要坚决地站在反对帝国主义侵略的最前列”。他和同学们连夜写标语，参加抗议集会和示威游行。
    在刀茅巷里有一位年过半百的蒋萍萍老太太，她的第三个儿子曾经在抗美援朝战争中英勇牺牲。这几天，蒋老太太不断向邻居们揭露美英帝国主义的侵略罪行。她愤慨地说：“美国侵略者杀害我儿子的仇还没报，它又在中东动刀枪，我们决不能让他横行，我们要美国军队滚出台湾”。蒋老太太全家老小十一人都对美帝国主义侵略者充满无比仇恨，连她九岁的小孙子也咬牙切齿地说：“打倒侵略者，为叔叔报仇”！
    西子湖畔的反侵略浪涛现在正越卷越大，越卷越高。
