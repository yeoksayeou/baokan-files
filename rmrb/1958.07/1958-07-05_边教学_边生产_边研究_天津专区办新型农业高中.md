Learning, Producing, and Researching Simultaneously
Tianjin Special District Runs New Type of Agricultural High School

(Our dispatch) The Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province has adopted a method combining teaching, production, and research, utilizing the technical strength of the agricultural sector to run a new type of agricultural high school. This has been welcomed by the masses, and both the schools and agricultural departments are satisfied. There are already six such schools established, including Jinghai Yangzhuangwowa Senior High School, with a total of 1,190 students.

These schools were established to adapt to the new situation of large-scale development of paddy fields and the shortage of technical personnel. In order to combine theory with practice, some schools are attached to farms, while others independently manage a portion of land and sideline occupations. The school sites are close to farms and agricultural technology research institutions. Students practice a half-work, half-study system. The site of Yangzhuangwowa Middle School in Jinghai County is located together with the county's state-owned farm and the Tianjin Rice Research Institute of the Northern Rice Crop Research Center. Farm cadres and researchers from the Tianjin Rice Research Institute serve as agricultural teachers for the school, lecturing, operating, and researching in the farm's experimental fields.

In addition to completing the basic subjects of ordinary middle schools, these agricultural middle schools have determined agricultural technology courses based on the production needs of the region. Jinghai, Ba County, Qing County, Renqiu and other counties have nearly one million mu of low-lying land, and agricultural production is mainly rice cultivation. The agricultural middle schools in these counties mainly cultivate technical personnel for rice cultivation. Anci County is a production area of cotton and fruit trees in the Tianjin area, and the agricultural middle school here also focuses on cotton planting and horticulture.

### 边教学　边生产　边研究  天津专区办新型农业高中

    边教学　边生产　边研究
    天津专区办新型农业高中
    本报讯　河北省天津专区采取教学、生产、研究相结合的办法，利用农业部门的技术力量举办新型的农业高中，得到群众拥护，学校和农业部门也都满意。现在已经办起来的有静海杨庄窝洼高级中学等六处，共有学生一千一百九十人。
    这些学校是在适应稻田大量发展、技术力量不足的新情况下兴办的。为了使理论与实际相结合，学校有的附设在农场里，有的独立经营一部分土地和副业。学校校址靠近农场和农业技术研究机关。学生实行半工半读。静海县杨庄窝洼中学的校址，与本县的国营农场和北方稻作研究中心的天津稻作研究所在一起。农场干部和天津稻作研究所的研究人员担任学校的农业课教师，在农场的试验田里边讲授，边操作，边研究。
    这些农业中学除完成普通中学的基本学科外，都根据本地区的生产需要确定了农业技术课。静海、霸县、青县、任丘等县都有近百万亩的低洼地，农业生产主要是稻作。这些县的农业中学主要是培养稻作的技术人才。安次县是天津地区棉花、果木的产地，这里的农业中学也以植棉、园艺为学习重点。
