    Beijing to Build a Slag Cement Plant

    (Our newspaper dispatch) China's first sulfate slag cement plant will be built in Beijing.

    Sulfate slag cement, using blast furnace slag from steel plants as its main raw material, has recently been successfully trial-produced through the collaboration of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Building Materials Industry and the Cement Research Institute. The trial-produced product has a grade of 400 and performs well.

    Beijing has decided to build a sulfate slag cement plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons near the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The first phase of the project will commence in August.

    In today's rapidly developing iron and steel industry, fully utilizing blast furnace slag to produce cement is of great economic significance. In the past, slag from steel plants across the country, except for a small amount used as an admixture for silicate cement, was mostly discarded. Taking the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant as an example, it discards more than 100,000 tons annually, occupying a large amount of arable land. With the rapid increase in steel production, millions of tons of slag will need to be processed each year. The construction of the sulfate slag cement plant not only solves the waste disposal problem of steel production but also rapidly expands cement production.

    The construction of a sulfate slag cement plant, due to the reduction of the clinker calcination process, requires more than 50% less investment than a silicate cement plant of the same scale, and the labor productivity will be increased by about 200%, thereby greatly reducing the cost of cement.

    北京将建一座矿渣水泥厂
    本报讯　我国第一座硫酸盐矿渣水泥厂将在北京建设。
    用钢铁厂高炉矿渣为主要原料的硫酸盐矿渣水泥，最近由北京市建筑材料工业局和水泥研究院协作试制成功。试制产品的标号是四百号，性能良好。
    北京市决定在石景山钢铁厂附近建设年产三十万吨的硫酸盐矿渣水泥厂一座，第一期工程即将在8月份动工。
    在钢铁工业飞跃发展的今天，充分利用高炉矿渣生产水泥，具有十分重大的经济意义。以往全国各地钢铁厂的矿渣，除少数被做为矽酸盐水泥的掺合料外，大部被废弃。以石景山钢铁厂为例，每年就要废弃十多万吨，占用了大量耕地。随着钢铁产量的猛增，每年将有上百万吨的矿渣须待处理。硫酸盐矿渣水泥厂的建设，不仅解决了钢铁生产的废料处理问题，而且能迅速地扩大水泥产量。
    建设硫酸盐矿渣水泥厂，由于减少了熟料锻烧过程，比同等规模的矽酸盐水泥厂要减少投资50％以上，劳动生产率要提高200％左右，因之水泥成本也会大大降低。　（薛天霖）
