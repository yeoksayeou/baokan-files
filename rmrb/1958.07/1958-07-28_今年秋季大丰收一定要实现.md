We have already achieved the first victory on the 1958 agricultural production front. The total output of summer crops reached 101 billion jin, an increase of more than 69% over the total output of summer crops in 1957, and more than 20 billion jin more than the total increase in 1956 and 1957 combined. In the history of China's agricultural development, which dynasty has ever witnessed such a miracle? In the history of the world's agricultural development, which country has ever experienced a growth rate of 69%? Now, the people of the whole country are proudly celebrating the great victory of the summer harvest. We should be proud, because we have created an unprecedented miracle in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The liberated Chinese people, the Chinese peasants with a high degree of revolutionary consciousness, can not only do anything that mankind has already done, but also do things that no predecessors have ever done. However, the Chinese people, whose ideal is great socialism and communism, never gloat over the achievements they have already made and stop moving forward. No matter how great these achievements are, they are always small compared with our goals. We always regard the victories we have already won as a stepping stone to greater victories, as the beginning of greater victories. The great victory of the summer harvest is unprecedented, but it is by no means the end of the road. While celebrating the unprecedented bumper summer harvest, we must work harder to strive for an even greater autumn harvest. In our country, the planting area of autumn crops accounts for more than 70% of the total planting area for the whole year. Therefore, striving for a greater harvest of autumn crops this year is of even greater significance. Only with a bumper harvest of autumn crops can we be considered to have achieved a bumper harvest for the whole year.

In our country, wheat, rapeseed, and other summer crops are generally considered to be low-yield crops. Since we can make wheat, rapeseed, etc. grow at a rate of 69% and become high-yield crops, we will certainly be able to make rice, sorghum, sweet potatoes, and all other major autumn crops, which have always been high-yield crops, grow at a faster and higher rate.

To achieve a bumper harvest of autumn crops, to achieve a growth rate even higher than the growth rate of summer crops, is by no means just a subjective wish, as the "observers" say. We have all the conditions and possibilities. As long as we are good at using these favorable conditions, we can turn possibilities into reality, and we can make our country's autumn crops achieve a greater harvest.

Everyone remembers that when wheat was sown last autumn, although we had already won the victory in the struggle to rectify the style of work and combat the rightists, this struggle had not yet come to an end at that time, especially in the countryside, where the struggle between the two roads was just beginning. The broad masses of peasants were still bound by various kinds of thoughts, especially conservative ideas. The bud of the Great Leap Forward had already appeared in some areas, but it had not yet formed a climax in all rural areas. Under such circumstances, various measures that were decisive for a bumper harvest, such as deep plowing, close planting, and all other new farming methods and measures, were not implemented perfectly and thoroughly. However, by the time of the sowing of the major autumn crops, the situation was completely different. The struggle to rectify the style of work and combat the rightists had already won a comprehensive and thorough victory, and the struggle between the two roads had also won a great victory. Especially after the publication and deep popularization of the Party's general line for building socialism, the broad masses of cadres and peasants overcame various kinds of superstitions and conservative ideas, and established a communist style of daring to think, daring to act, daring to speak, and daring to do. The cultivation techniques of major autumn crops were carried out with a completely new look. This year's sowing of major autumn crops was not only fully prepared materially, with sufficient base fertilizer and early start, but also the quality of sowing was better than any previous year. At the same time, close planting - a key measure to ensure a bumper harvest - has been promoted on a wider area. This has laid a reliable material foundation and provided a very powerful material guarantee for this year's bumper harvest of autumn crops.

If people did not dare to imagine that the yield could increase by tens or hundreds of percent in the struggle to achieve a bumper summer harvest, and did not dare to imagine that one mu of wheat could produce two thousand jin (let alone five thousand jin or seven thousand jin), then now, in the face of the fact that the low-yield crop of wheat can produce more than seven thousand jin per mu, conservative ideas have been completely shattered. The broad masses of peasants said when summing up the experience of the summer harvest: "Without the idea of ten thousand jin, there would be no harvest of ten thousand jin," "Without the target of ten thousand jin, there would be no measures of ten thousand jin." Since the broad masses of cadres and peasants are determined to make the major autumn crops "produce ten thousand jin per mu," they will certainly be able to "produce ten thousand jin per mu." Since the broad masses of peasants are determined to increase the production of major autumn crops at the same speed and at a higher speed as summer crops, they will certainly be able to increase production at a higher speed.

The idea that "man proposes, God disposes" once dominated us for thousands of years. However, after the Great Leap Forward last winter and this spring, especially after the struggle to win a bumper wheat harvest against various natural disasters (especially drought), people not only created and accumulated rich experience in fighting natural disasters, but also firmly established the idea that "man will conquer nature." Although various places encountered unprecedented drought threats during the summer planting and hoeing season, the broad masses of peasants fought tenaciously against natural disasters with the firm confidence and heroic spirit of "if there is no water to irrigate, use sweat to irrigate, and do not let the harvest be reduced by a single point" and "fight drought until the day of the bumper harvest, and protect the seedlings until the grain enters the granary," and overcame nature. The broad masses of rural cadres and peasants are more determined, more confident, and have more ways to overcome any natural disasters in the future. The biggest enemies affecting China's agricultural harvest are drought and flood. Drought has already been overcome by us. If there is a flood, the broad masses of peasants will certainly be able to overcome it. The bold statement of "guaranteeing a bumper harvest despite drought or flood" is the best proof of this confidence and strength.

Half a year ago, most rural work cadres still lacked production experience and experience in leading the masses to strive for a bumper harvest. The broad masses of peasants also lacked advanced production methods and advanced farming experience in striving for a bumper crop harvest. After half a year of actual struggle, cadres, through engaging in "experimental fields," "organizing visits and comparisons," "holding exhibitions," "on-site meetings," etc., not only gained more solid production knowledge themselves, but also learned a series of working methods and leadership experience in leading and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. The masses have also gained many new production methods and farming experience, such as deep plowing and close planting, applying fertilizer and watering, preventing and controlling pests and diseases, fighting drought and preventing floods, and advanced field management. When people lacked experience and explored experience, they were able to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer crops such as wheat. With relatively rich experience, they are more confident and have more ways to make major autumn crops achieve a greater harvest.

Last winter and this spring, our country carried out unprecedented large-scale agricultural capital construction: digging wells, harnessing rivers, building canals, building reservoirs, and expanding the irrigated area by more than 400 million mu. Mass movements of agricultural tool reform and technical reform were carried out, creating and inventing tens of thousands of new agricultural tools and various kinds of pesticides, and inventing and creating many methods for manufacturing chemical fertilizers. However, the huge role of these many agricultural capital construction projects, these many new agricultural tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, was not truly realized on the summer crops harvested before today, but on the autumn crops harvested later. Last winter, we entered the Great Leap Forward "in a hurry." Compared with the conditions at the time of sowing major autumn crops, the summer crops such as wheat were "congenitally deficient." Now we have the above-mentioned favorable conditions for striving for an autumn harvest. As long as we go all out, aim high, are good at using these favorable conditions, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, we will certainly be able to achieve an autumn harvest, and we will certainly be able to make the output of major autumn crops increase upward at a faster rate.

Now, major autumn crops are growing rapidly. The current main task is to do a good job in field management and overcome all natural disasters. This is the decisive key to winning a bumper harvest for the whole year. Any negligence or carelessness will affect the overall bumper harvest. A slight loss of opportunity will cause irreparable losses. Earlier, we listed various favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest of major autumn crops. However, these many favorable conditions only created the possibility for an autumn harvest. Although this possibility is very great, it is not the bumper harvest itself. Turning possibility into reality requires the active efforts of Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of peasants. From this year's summer harvest, we have gained the following experience: the quality of sowing is indeed the primary key to increasing production. Without good sowing, there will be no good harvest. If sowing is not deep plowing or close planting, a high yield cannot be obtained. However, the idea that as long as the sowing work is done well, there is no need to make other efforts is wrong. In fact, the quality of field management determines the level of output. When wheat was sown last year, it encountered an unprecedented drought and the various yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing and close planting were definitely not as good or as widespread as when major autumn crops were sown. The reason why wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year was mainly due to field management and the victory gained from resolutely fighting against natural disasters. Many facts of high-yield production further prove that all those who have implemented intensive cultivation from the beginning of plowing and sowing, cultivated and managed according to the growth requirements and habits of crops, and were prepared to overcome all natural disasters, have achieved high-yield production. In the struggle to win a bumper harvest of major autumn crops, this experience should be accepted and the field management of major autumn crops should be strengthened. There are many aspects of field management work. What central links should we grasp? We believe that in addition to doing a good job in timely cultivating and weeding without missing the farming season, we should pay special attention to and thoroughly do a good job in three major tasks: eliminating three types of seedlings, applying sufficient topdressing fertilizer, and preventing and overcoming all natural disasters.

This year's seedlings of major autumn crops are generally growing well, but due to various reasons, a portion of three types of seedlings have appeared. Even in the fields with first-class seedlings, not every piece is fully planted and every plant is thriving. Therefore, carrying out a comprehensive and large-scale movement to check and replant seedlings for all major autumn crops is of great significance. It is necessary to ensure that every piece of land has no broken ridges, every ridge has no missing seedlings, and every seedling is thriving. It is necessary to thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the three types of seedlings, quickly and promptly upgrade the two types of seedlings, and make all major autumn crops become first-class seedlings. Various places have already created many successful experiences in checking and replanting seedlings and eliminating three types of seedlings, such as Yunnan Province's method of eliminating three types of seedlings by upgrading each type step by step and repeating the cycle, and the method of checking seedlings and checking measures using the increase in production target as a yardstick. These are all good experiences and should be vigorously promoted. As long as we raise all the seedlings to the level of first-class seedlings in a timely manner, we will be able to obtain a large area of bumper harvest, and we will be able to make the output of major autumn crops increase upward at a higher and greater speed.

The lack of fertilizer for major autumn crops is a fairly common problem in various places. Last winter and this spring, various places accumulated a large amount of fertilizer, but a lot of it has been used on summer crops, and the topdressing fertilizer left for major autumn crops is very limited. It is difficult to obtain high-yield production without sufficient fertilizer. Various places must try every possible means to accumulate and create fertilizer to ensure that various crops have sufficient fertilizer and meet the needs of crops at various stages of growth and development. Now, many places have created many methods of accumulating and creating fertilizer, and many places have used local methods to manufacture very good chemical fertilizers. Promoting these fertilizer production methods, especially promoting the method of manufacturing chemical fertilizers by local methods, can enable us to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer relatively thoroughly in a short period of time, and can enable all major autumn crops to have sufficient fertilizer and grow more vigorously.

Now is the season when various natural disasters occur frequently. According to the current situation, whether it is diseases, insect pests, floods, or droughts, they may occur severely this year. Various places must fully raise their vigilance, strive for the initiative, and make all ideological, organizational, and material preparations to prepare to overcome natural disasters greater than the 1954 flood and the 1957 drought. Since before today, in the struggle to win a bumper summer harvest, many places have overcome unprecedented droughts and other natural disasters and achieved an unprecedented bumper summer harvest, and after we have rich experience in fighting against natural disasters, and after we have more water conservancy projects for preventing drought and preventing floods, we will certainly be able to overcome any natural disasters that may occur in the future, and we will certainly be able to prevent disasters without disasters and eliminate disasters with disasters. Whatever disaster occurs, we will overcome whatever disaster. Wherever a disaster occurs, we will eliminate it there. The key lies in whether we can be good at educating the masses and leading the masses to resolutely fight against natural disasters, and whether we can prevent any possible slackness, complacency, and numbness in thought and organization. We believe that as long as we do all this, we will certainly be able to overcome all possible natural disasters, and we will be able to win a bumper harvest greater than the summer harvest.

Striving for a bumper autumn harvest this year and striving for a bumper harvest for the whole year is not only of great economic significance, but also of great political significance. The high-speed development of agricultural production in our country will not only completely bankrupt the "observers" and "autumn reckoning factions" at home, but also make imperialism tremble in the face of our victory. All cadres and the broad masses of people must recognize the great significance of the struggle to win a bumper autumn harvest, go all out, aim high, and on the basis of the bumper summer harvest, advance victoriously. This autumn's bumper harvest must be realized.

### 今年秋季大丰收一定要实现

    今年秋季大丰收一定要实现
    我们已经取得了1958年农业生产战线上的第一个胜利。夏季作物的总产量达到了一千零一十亿斤，比1957年夏季作物的总产量增产69％以上，比1956和1957两年的增产总量还要多二百多亿斤。在中国的农业发展史上，什么朝代曾经出现过这样的奇迹呢？在世界的农业发展史上，有哪个国家曾经出现过69％的增长速度呢？现在，全国人民正在自豪地庆祝夏季丰收的伟大胜利。我们应该自豪，因为我们创造了古今中外史无前例的奇迹。解放了的中国人民，有高度革命觉悟的中国农民，不仅能够作出人类已经作到的任何事情，而且能够作出前人从来没有作出的事情。但是，以伟大的社会主义共产主义为自己理想的中国人民，从来不在已经获得的成绩面前沾沾自喜，停步不前，这些已经获得的胜利无论多么伟大，同我们奋斗的目标比较起来，总是渺小的，我们总是把已经获得的胜利作为争取更大胜利的阶梯，作为更大胜利的开始。夏收的伟大胜利是空前的，但它绝不是绝后的；庆祝夏季的空前大丰收，一定要更加努力争取秋季更大的丰收，在我国，大秋作物的播种面积占全年播种总面积的70％以上，因此，争取今年秋季作物的更大丰收，就有了更加巨大的意义。只有大秋作物的丰收，我们才算取得全年的丰收。
    在我国，小麦、油菜以及其他夏季作物，一般认为是低产作物。我们既然能够使小麦、油菜等得以69％的速度增长，变为高产作物，当然也一定能够使素来就是高产作物的水稻、高粱、红薯以及一切大秋作物以更快更高的速度增长。
    要取得秋季作物的大丰收，要取得比夏季作物产量的增长速度还要高的速度，绝不是像“观潮派”所说的只是一种主观愿望。我们有一切条件和可能。只要我们善于运用这些有利条件，就能够把可能性变为现实，就能够使我国的秋季作物获得更大的丰收。
    大家还记得，去年秋天播种小麦的时候，虽然我们已经取得了整风反右派斗争的胜利，但是当时这一斗争并没有最后结束，特别是在农村，两条道路的斗争还在刚刚开始。广大农民还被各种各样的思想，特别是保守思想束缚着；大跃进的萌芽已经在某些地区出现，但并未在全部农村形成高潮。在这种情况下，对于丰收有决定意义的各项措施，如深耕、密植以及一切其他新的耕作方法和措施，都执行得不够完善和彻底，而到大秋作物播种的时候，情况就完全不同了，整风反右斗争已经获得全面的彻底胜利，两条道路的斗争也已经获得巨大的胜利，特别是经过党的建设社会主义总路线的公布和深入人心，广大干部和农民克服了各种各样的迷信、保守思想，树立了敢想、敢干、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格，大秋作物的栽培技术就以全新的面貌进行了。今年大秋作物的播种不仅物质准备充分，基肥足，动手早，而且播种质量比以往任何一年都更好。同时，密植——这一保证丰收的关键措施，已经在更广大的面积上得到了推广。这就为今年秋季作物大丰收打下了可靠的物质基础，提供了十分有力的物质保证。
    如果说在争取夏季作物丰收的斗争中，人们还不敢设想产量能够百分之十几、几十地增长，还不敢设想一亩麦子能产二千斤（更不要说五千斤、七千斤了）。那么，现在在低产作物的小麦能够亩产七千多斤的事实面前，保守思想已经彻底地被打破了。广大农民在总结夏季丰收的经验时说：“没有万斤的思想，就没有万斤的收获”，“没有万斤的指标，就没有万斤的措施”。既然广大的干部和农民群众有决心使大秋作物“亩产万斤”，那就一定能够“亩产万斤”。既然广大农民决心使大秋作物像夏季作物一样的速度和更高的速度增产，那就一定能够以更高的速度增产。
    “谋事在人，成事在天”的思想曾经统治了我们几千年，可是经过去冬今春的大跃进，特别是经过争取小麦丰收同各种各样的自然灾害（特别是旱灾）的斗争，人们不但创造和积累了丰富的同自然灾害斗争的经验，而且牢固地树立起了“人定胜天”的思想。各地在夏种和锄苗时期，虽然遇见了几十年来所未有的干旱威胁，但广大农民却以“没有水浇用汗浇，不让收获少分毫”，“抗旱抗到丰收日，保苗保到粮进仓”的坚定信心和英雄气概，同自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，并战胜了自然。广大的农村干部和农民更有决心有信心也更有办法在今后战胜任何自然灾害。影响我国农业丰收的最大敌人是旱灾和涝灾，旱灾已经被我们战胜了，如果出现了涝灾，广大农民也一定能够战胜它，“旱涝保丰收”的豪言壮语，就是这种信心和力量的最好证明。
    半年以前，多数的农村工作干部，都还缺乏生产经验和领导群众争取丰收的工作经验；广大农民也还都缺乏争取作物丰收的先进的生产方法和先进耕作经验。经过半年来的实际斗争，干部经过搞“试验田”、“组织参观评比”、“开展览会”、“现场会议”等等，不仅自己有了较踏实的生产知识，更学会了领导和推动生产大跃进的一系列的工作方法和领导经验；群众也获得了深耕密植，使肥浇水，防治病虫害，抗旱防涝以及先进的田间管理等等许多新的生产方法和耕作经验。在人们缺乏经验、摸索经验的时候，都能使小麦等夏收作物获得空前大丰收，有了比较丰富的经验以后，就更有把握有办法，使大秋作物获得更大丰收了。
    去冬今春，我国进行了史无前例的大规模的农业基本建设：挖井、治河、修渠道、建水库，扩大灌溉面积四亿多亩；开展了群众性的农具改革和技术改革运动，创造发明了千万种新式农具和各种各样的农药，发明和创造了很多制造化学肥料的方法。但是这许多农业基本建设工程，这许多新式农具、农药和化肥，真正发生它们的巨大作用，不是在今天以前的夏收作物上，而是在以后的秋收作物上。去年冬天我们是“仓促”进入大跃进的，同大秋作物播种时的条件比较，小麦等夏收作物是“先天不足”的，现在我们有了以上种种争取秋季丰收的有利条件，只要我们鼓足干劲，力争上游，善于运用这些有利条件，充分发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，我们就一定能够获得秋季大丰收，就一定能够使大秋作物的产量以更快的速度向上增长。
    现在，大秋作物正在迅速生长。当前的主要任务是做好田间管理工作，战胜一切自然灾害。这是夺得全年大丰收的决定关键，任何疏忽大意，都会影响全面丰收。稍失良机，就会造成难以弥补的损失。前面我们列举了争取大秋作物丰收的种种有利条件。但这许多有利条件只是为秋季大丰收创造了可能性。虽然这种可能性是十分巨大的，但它并不就是丰收的本身。把可能性变成现实，还需要各级党委和广大农民的积极努力。从今年夏季丰收中，我们得到了这样一条经验：播种的质量固然是增产的首要关键。没有好的播种，就没有好的收获，播种时不深耕，不密植，肯定不能得到高额产量。但认为只要把播种工作做好就不必再作其他努力的思想是不对的。事实上，田间管理工作的好坏，倒是决定着产量的高低。去年小麦播种时和播种后遇到了几十年来少有的干旱，深耕、密植等各种增产措施决不如大秋作物播种时作得好、作得广泛，今年小麦所以获得空前的丰收，主要得力于田间管理，得力于坚决地同自然灾害作斗争所获得的胜利。许多高额丰产的事实更进一步证明，凡是从耕地播种开始就实行精耕细作，按照作物的生长要求和习性进行培育管理，并有准备地战胜一切自然灾害的，都获得了高额丰产。在争取大秋作物丰收的斗争中，应该接受这个经验，加强大秋作物的田间管理工作。田间管理工作方面很多，我们应该抓住几个什么样的中心环节呢？我们认为除了不失时机不误农时地作好中耕、除草等工作外，要特别注意并彻底作好消灭三类苗、施足追肥和防止并战胜一切自然灾害三件大事。
    今年大秋作物的禾苗一般都生长良好，但也由于种种原因，出现了一部分三类苗。就是在一类苗的禾田里也并不是块块全苗、棵棵茁壮。因此，对所有的大秋作物进行全面的大规模的查苗补苗运动，就有了十分重要的意义。一定要作到块块无断垅，垅垅不缺苗，苗苗都茁壮。一定要彻底、干净地消灭三类苗，迅速、及时地提高二类苗，使全部大秋作物都成为头等的一类苗。各地在查苗补苗、消灭三类苗中，已经创造了很多成功的经验，如云南省的逐类升级、循环反复消灭三类苗的办法；以增产指标为尺度查苗、查措施的作法，都是很好的经验，应该大力推广。只要我们不失时宜地把全部禾苗都提高到一类苗的水平，我们就能够获得大面积的丰收，就能够使大秋作物的产量以更高更大的速度向上增长。
    大秋作物的肥料不足，是当前各地一个相当普遍的问题。去冬今春各地曾积集了大量肥料，但很多已使用在夏收作物上，留给大秋作物的追肥就十分有限了。没有充足的肥料是很难获得高额丰产的。各地必须想尽一切办法积肥造肥，保证各种作物都有充足的肥料，满足作物各个生长发育阶段对肥料的需要。现在，很多地方已经创造了很多积肥、造肥的办法，很多地方已经用土办法制造出很好的化学肥料。推广这些造肥方法，特别是推广土法造化肥的办法，就能够使我们在短时间内比较彻底地解决肥料不足的问题，就能够使全部大秋作物都能有足够的肥料而更加茁壮繁茂地生长起来。
    现在正是各种自然灾害频繁发生的季节，根据目前已经露头的情况看，不论病、虫、水、旱灾害，今年都可能严重发生。各地要充分提高警惕性，争取主动，作好一切思想上、组织上和物质上的准备工作，准备战胜比1954年水灾和1957年旱灾更大的自然灾害，既然在今天以前，在争取夏季大丰收的斗争中，很多地方都战胜了几十年来所未有的旱灾和其他的自然灾害，取得了夏季空前的大丰收，在我们有了丰富的同自然灾害作斗争的经验以后，在我们有了更多的防旱防涝的水利工程以后，我们也就一定能够战胜今后可能出现的任何自然灾害，一定能够做到无灾防灾，有灾灭灾；发生什么灾害，就战胜什么灾害；灾害发生在哪里，就把它消灭在哪里。关键就在于我们是否能够善于教育群众、领导群众坚决地同自然灾害作斗争，在于我们能否在思想上、组织上防止可能产生的任何松懈自满和麻痹大意。我们相信，只要我们作到了这一切，我们就一定能够战胜一切可能的自然灾害，我们就能够夺得比夏收更大的丰收。
    争取今年秋季大丰收，争取全年大丰收，不仅有伟大的经济意义，也有伟大的政治意义。我国农业生产的高速度发展，不仅使国内的“观潮派”、“秋后算账派”彻底破产，也将使帝国主义在我们的胜利面前发抖。全体干部和广大人民必须认识争取秋季大丰收斗争的伟大意义，鼓足干劲，力争上游，在夏季丰收的基础上，乘胜前进吧，今年秋季大丰收一定要实现。
