    We Must Develop the Steel Industry at High Speed

    How can we achieve high speed? This involves the question of what path to take. Some people advocate that to produce more steel, we should build modern, large-scale steel enterprises. However, building modern, large-scale factories takes a long time, requiring a complete set of equipment such as steelmaking converters, blowers, and cranes, and these equipment themselves require a huge amount of steel to manufacture. Obviously, this cannot be done immediately. Another path is to adopt methods that are small-scale and indigenous, which do not require complete sets of technical equipment, and can use various simple methods for smelting, allowing for large-scale and widespread efforts; because the technology of small-scale smelting and indigenous methods is relatively simple, it can be quickly mastered by the people, started immediately, and produce iron and steel immediately. Taking small-scale steelmaking and indigenous blast furnace steelmaking as examples, although the output is only a few dozen kilograms, the characteristic of this smelting is small and indigenous. Once combined with our conditions of large population, vast land and abundant resources, the will to be revolutionary despite being poor, and the determination to progress from scratch, if we build thousands upon thousands of them, we will produce thousands and tens of thousands of tons of steel in a short time, creating miracles. The recent success of the people in Nanjing, Yangzhou and other places in developing small-scale, indigenous iron and steelmaking fully proves this point.

    Precisely for this reason, we say that steel production is the "marshal" in industrial production, the "key link" of industry. Only by firmly grasping this "key link" can we, along the path indicated by the General Line, drive the overall leap forward of various industries, promote the rapid advancement of agriculture, and enable the entire national economy to develop forward at the highest speed. Conversely, if we lose this "key link," various tasks will be done slowly, poorly, and wastefully, and even be at a loss, let alone talk about a leap forward.

    Of course, advocating small and indigenous methods today does not exclude foreign and large-scale methods. Our goal is to build a modern industrial system, and the steel industry certainly needs to be modernized. However, to achieve this goal, we must go through this process of being small-scale and indigenous. Without going through small and indigenous, we cannot achieve the goal of modernization. Therefore, our proposition is: combining indigenous and foreign methods, with small and indigenous as the main focus, moving from indigenous to foreign, and developing foreign methods from indigenous ones. Just like carrying out the revolution, in the early stages, we did not have foreign guns and cannons, nor did we have regular troops, but we adopted a strategy of starting with broadswords and spears, starting with militias, and quickly developed a strong armed force from scratch, from indigenous to foreign, seized modern weapons from the enemy, equipped ourselves, defeated the three major enemies, and won the victory in the revolutionary war. The historical process of the entire industry is also like this; modern large-scale industry has not always been modern, but has always developed from handicrafts to large-scale industry, from small to large, and from indigenous to foreign. The world's first machine was certainly not produced by a machine. Our focus on small and indigenous methods for iron and steelmaking today is to create conditions for building large-scale steel enterprises tomorrow. Do not underestimate today's indigenous furnaces; the steel for manufacturing complete sets of converters, open-hearth furnaces, cranes and other modern equipment in the future will all be blown out of these small furnaces.

    All regions with iron ore and mineral sand should organize villages and communes to build a large number of indigenous blast furnaces that produce 500 to 1,000 catties of iron per day. Its advantages are fast furnace construction, no need for steel, and simple technology. This is an important measure to develop steel production by relying on the masses and relying on indigenous methods, and should be universally promoted throughout the province. At the same time, we must also build a large number of simple small blast furnaces. Its advantages are low investment, quick results, simple technology and equipment, and it can produce gray pig iron, suitable for county-run or village-run, or village-commune joint ventures. In addition, we should focus on building a number of large small blast furnaces above eight cubic meters. This is to enable those special districts, cities, and counties that are close to power sources and iron ore, and have better transportation conditions, to build as many backbone steel plants as possible with a higher degree of mechanization and larger output. Accelerating the manufacturing of steel smelting equipment and the supply of steel is a matter of urgency. The current problem is the lack of steel or mismatched models. Therefore, all regions are required to face the masses, face the grassroots, inventory warehouses, and uniformly allocate and concentrate the use of raw materials by special districts and cities to ensure the needs of steel equipment manufacturing.

    Carrying out socialist large-scale collaboration is an important part of accelerating steel production and construction. To this end, the geological department is required to combine with the masses to quickly clarify the iron ore resources of our province within a certain period; the coal department is required to increase the production of raw coal and coke to ensure the fuel needs of the steel industry; the building materials manufacturing department should vigorously organize the production of refractory materials to supply the needs of furnace construction; the power department should accelerate the completion of this year's capital construction tasks of the power industry and supply electricity to the steel smelting industry in advance.

    Our country has entered a new historical period of great technological revolution. As long as the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people is fully brought into play, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Objective possibilities are unlimited, and people's subjective initiative is also unlimited. Isn't that so? Our heroic people can catch up with and surpass some of the world's most advanced scientific and technological levels. Relatively complex things like automobiles and tractors can be produced in very small and simple iron factories. Then, some equipment such as blowers and motors used in small iron smelting furnaces are not complicated machines, and there are ready-made models and drawings. Will it block the way forward for the heroic people? It can be seen that as long as the leaders in various places first liberate their minds, actively mobilize and rely on the masses, and use the mass line method to solve the difficulties of equipment and materials, they will be able to break through the difficulties and achieve a leap forward in steel production.

### 我们要高速度发展钢铁工业

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    我们要高速度发展钢铁工业
    怎样才能高速度？这里牵涉到一个走什么道路的问题。有人主张多炼钢铁，就该建设现代化的大型钢铁企业。可是，建设现代化的大型工厂需要很长时间，要有炼钢转炉、鼓风机、行车等等一系列成套的设备，而这些设备本身就需要数量极为巨大的钢铁来制造。显然，这不是马上可以办得到的。另一条道路是采用以小为主、以土为主的办法，它不需要成套的技术设备，可以用多种多样简陋的办法来冶炼，可以到处大搞、遍地开花；由于小型冶炼和土法冶炼的技术比较简单，因此，可以迅速为人民群众所掌握，立即上马，立即出铁出钢。我们拿小型炼钢和土法吹风炼钢来说，其产量虽不过几十公斤，然而，这种冶炼的特点，是一小二土，一旦和我们人多地大物博、穷要革命、白要上进的条件相结合，成千成万个的办起来，那我们就会在短时间内炼出几千几万吨的钢，产生出奇迹来。最近南京、扬州等地人民群众大搞小型的、土法的炼铁、炼钢成功的事实，充分证明了这一点。
    正因为如此，我们说，钢铁生产是工业生产中的元帅，是工业之“纲”，只有紧紧抓住这条“纲”，才能沿着总路线所指引的多快好省的道路，带动各项工业全面大跃进，才能促进农业的突飞猛进，才能使整个国民经济以最高的速度向前发展。反之，丢掉了这条“纲”，各项工作就会办得少慢差费，甚至一筹莫展，更无从谈起什么大跃进了。
    当然，今天提倡小、土，并不排斥洋、大。我们的目的是建设现代化的工业体系，钢铁工业当然更需要现代化，可是，要达到这个目的，目前非经过这个以小、土为主的过程不可。不经过小、土，就达不到现代化的目的。所以，我们的主张是：土洋并举，以小为主，以土为主，从土到洋，土中出洋。就像干革命一样，在初期，我们没有洋枪大炮，没有正规军队，但我们采取了从大刀标枪搞起，从民兵搞起，很快从无到有、从土到洋的发展起强大的武装，从敌人手里夺取了现代化武器，装备了自己，打倒了三大敌人，取得了革命战争的胜利。整个工业的历史进程也是这样，现代大工业也不是从来就是现代化的，总是由手工业而大工业，从小到大，由土而洋发展起来的。世界上的第一部机器决不是由机器生产出来的。我们今天以小、土为主来炼铁炼钢，就是为了明天举办大型钢铁企业创造条件。不要小看了今天的土炉子，将来制造成套的转炉、平炉、行车等现代设备的钢材，都要从这小炉子吹将出来。

    凡是有铁矿和矿砂的地区，应组织乡、社大量兴建日产五百斤至一千斤铁的土高炉，它的优点是建炉快，不需要钢材，技术简单。这是依靠群众，依靠土办法发展钢铁生产的重要措施，要在全省范围内普遍推广。与此同时，还要大量兴建简易小高炉，它的优点是投资少，收效快，技术设备简单，而且能产灰生铁，适于县办或乡办、乡社合办。另外，有重点的建设一部分八立方公尺以上的大型小高炉，这样作是为了使那些靠近电源和铁矿，以及交通条件较好的专、市、县，尽量多办一些机械化程度较高，产量大的骨干钢铁厂。加速钢铁冶炼设备制造和钢材的供应，是当务之急。目前存在的问题是，钢材缺乏或型号不符，因此，要求各地区，面向群众，面向基层，清查仓库，以专、市为单位统一调剂，集中使用原材料，保证钢铁设备制造的需要。
    开展社会主义大协作，是加速钢铁生产建设的重要环节。为此，要求地质部门与群众相结合，尽快的在一定期间，将我省铁矿资源查清；要求煤炭部门，增加原煤和焦炭生产，保证钢铁工业燃料需要；建筑材料制造部门，应大力组织耐火材料的生产，供应建炉需要；电力部门，应加速完成今年电力工业的基建任务，提前向钢铁冶炼工业供电。

    我国已经进入了伟大的技术革命的新的历史时期，只要把广大人民群众的冲天干劲充分发挥起来，没有克服不了的困难。客观的可能性是无限的，而人的主观能动性也是无限的。不是吗？一些世界上最先进的科学技术水平，我国的英雄人民都能赶上它和超过它，像汽车、拖拉机等等比较复杂的东西，都能在很小很简陋的铁工厂中生产出来。那末，小型炼铁炉上用的鼓风机、电动机等一些设备，本来不是什么复杂的不得了的机器，又有现成的样板和图纸，它还会挡住英雄人民的前进道路吗？由此可见，只要各地领导上首先解放了思想，积极发动群众和依靠群众，用群众路线的方法来解决设备和材料的困难，就一定能够冲破困难，达到钢铁生产的跃进。
