Shaanxi Comprehensively Utilizes Agricultural Machinery

If more than 100,000 double-wheeled, double-shared plows are slightly modified according to the needs of the farming season, it is equivalent to adding more than 100,000 harvesters or light-duty vehicles; if the power equipment of tractor stations, farms, and pumping stations is used for agricultural product processing during idle time, it is equivalent to 320 million labor days.

(Our reporter Wu Gang) reported: In the great leap forward of agricultural technology and the great development of rural local industries, agricultural machinery in some areas of Shaanxi Province has begun to develop in a new direction of comprehensive utilization. Agricultural machinery that was originally only used for a certain agricultural production is now used for rural sideline occupations and local industrial production in addition to undertaking the original agricultural production tasks. The result of this is that it not only improves the utilization efficiency of the original agricultural machinery, but also helps to overcome the difficulty of other aspects lacking machinery, especially power equipment.

Double-wheeled, double-shared plows have a variety of uses. After being converted into animal-powered harvesters, some have also been converted into small flatbed carts for transportation, and recently they have been converted into single-shared, double-layered deep plows. Tractors, which were originally mainly used for耕地 (gēngdì), are now developing towards a variety of operations, and are used for pumping irrigation, transportation, ginning, milling, and compacting earth dams for water conservancy projects during agricultural production gaps.

The reporter learned from relevant departments that the new situation emerging in Shaanxi Province in the great leap forward of agriculture and the great development of local industry is that, on the one hand, the vast rural areas need a large number of various types of machinery, but supply cannot meet demand; on the other hand, the existing agricultural machinery has a low utilization rate due to its single purpose and the impact of agricultural seasonality. The province's state-owned machine tractor stations and farms have 475 tractors, automobiles, combines, and generators, totaling 16,871 horsepower, but the utilization rate is generally low. Tractors, which are the main耕作 (gēngzuò) power, are generally used for five to six or seven months a year in the Guanzhong area where there is more耕作 (gēngzuò) and planting; in the Shaanbei area where only one season is planted a year, the usage time is less than one-third of the year. Other machines, such as different seeders and harvesters, have very low usage rates, and some are almost completely idle, due to their single purpose or inapplicability. Taking the relatively high utilization rate of the Doumen Tractor Station in Chang'an as an example, the time spent on耕种 (gēngzhòng) in a year is about five months. An 8-kilowatt generator is set up, which only drives a belt lathe, an electric drill, and a sand wheel. This generator is only turned on during repair time, and the three machines it drives are often not used at the same time. A 60-horsepower combine harvester only harvested 200 mu of wheat and threshed 10,000 jin this year, which is equivalent to being idle all year round. However, nearby agricultural cooperatives lack the power for milling and ginning. There are sets of seeders for cotton, corn, and wheat, but in fact, as long as they are slightly modified, they can also be used to sow corn after sowing cotton. Other items such as disc harrows, stubble plows, and connectors are idle for a long time because they are not applicable and no measures have been taken to modify and utilize them. The seed selector of the Dali Mechanized Farm is only used for a few hours a year.

The comprehensive utilization of existing rural machinery is a way to solve the contradiction between the large demand for machinery in rural areas and the inability to meet the demand. Agricultural technology revolution requires the manufacture and supply of a large number of agricultural machinery, but due to production and other conditions, it still takes some time. If we give full play to the role of existing machinery and talents, and comprehensively utilize various types of machinery in the existing rural areas, we can immediately solve a big problem. There are more than 100,000 double-wheeled, double-shared plows in the province's rural areas that have been and will soon be promoted. With slight modification during harvesting, it is equivalent to adding more than 100,000 harvesters. With slight modification during transportation, it is equivalent to adding 100,000 light-duty vehicles. If it is modified into seeding, cultivating, and other machinery according to the needs of agricultural labor at each time, a large number of manpower and animal power can be saved. Workers at the Doumen Tractor Station in Chang'an County modified 100 double-wheeled, double-shared plows into single-shared, double-layered deep plows in three days and nights for nearby agricultural cooperatives, which promptly solved the problem of deep plowing. All tractor stations and state-owned farms in the province have more than 200 repair workers and 21 lathes and drilling machines. If they are fully utilized during production gaps, it is equivalent to adding nearly 30 small machinery repair and assembly plants. All tractor stations, farms, pumping stations, and small hydropower stations that have been built in the past and recently, have a total of more than 24,600 horsepower of power equipment. In addition to the original workload, plus the necessary machine maintenance and inspection time, if half a year of idle time is used for agricultural product processing, it can drive about 26,000 small power cotton gins, which can gin nearly 10 billion jin of ginned cotton, which is equivalent to 320 million labor days. In the past, drivers at the Yan'an Tractor Station were bored and emotional due to less work. If more than 5,300 drivers, repair workers, and technicians in the above-mentioned units across the province use the gap time between work to invest in the rural technical revolution and the development of local industries, it will have a great impact.

From the current situation, there are still the following three problems that need to be solved in the comprehensive utilization of agricultural machinery. The first is the ideological problem. At present, some masses and cadres have begun to use comprehensive utilization to solve the contradiction between the shortage of various types of machinery in rural areas and the inability to meet the demand, but the relevant departments have not paid enough attention to this issue. Generally, they pay attention to increasing the purchase of machinery, but do not pay better attention to its use. Some power machinery could have multiple uses, but many people regard pumping as only for pumping, and耕种 (gēngzhòng) as only for耕种 (gēngzhòng), and have not tried to use it for other aspects during idle time. Although the masses have been constantly modifying double-wheeled, double-shared plows to make them comprehensively utilized and move towards versatility, the relevant departments have not considered how to absorb these creations of the masses and make them versatile farm implements in remanufacturing.

Second, the problem of collaboration. Comprehensive utilization requires collaboration between various relevant units, but at present, because each unit is doing its own thing, there is not enough active collaboration, which affects comprehensive utilization. The Water Conservancy Department specializes in managing the province's pumping stations and small hydropower stations, while tractor stations and state-owned farms are led by the Department of Agriculture. If comprehensive utilization is to be carried out, and idle power is used to help various places run local industries, it is necessary to collaborate with the Department of Industry and other departments for joint research.

Third, the systemic problem. From the current situation, the comprehensive utilization of those run by the masses is generally better, while the comprehensive utilization of those mainly run by the state in the past is worse. In the past, the small hydropower stations mainly run by the state were only used for lighting. The small hydropower stations self-run by the masses in Jingyang County and other places were used for ginning and milling in addition to lighting. State-owned tractor stations also have difficulty in connecting operations because ownership and use are not unified. Therefore, on the one hand, agricultural cooperatives try their best to do their own work, and the machinery of tractor stations is idle and unused. In order to solve this contradiction, small hydropower stations and pumping stations this year are handed over to the masses to run, and the province's tractor stations also plan to decentralize one-third of the tractors to agricultural cooperatives.

    一种机具多种用途　终年运转不使闲置
    陕西综合利用农业机械
    如果把十万多部双轮双铧犁根据农时需要稍加改装，就等于增加十万多部收割机或轻便小车；如果拖拉机站、农场、抽水站的动力设备在闲置时间投入农产品加工，就等于三亿二千万个劳动日
    本报讯　记者吴钢报道：在农业技术革命和农村地方工业大发展中，陕西省有些地方的农业机械，开始向综合利用的新方向发展。原来仅用于某一项农业生产的农业机械，现在除了负担原有农业生产任务以外，有的用于农村副业，有的用于地方工业生产。这样做的结果，既发挥了原有农业机械的利用效率，也帮助克服了其他方面缺乏机械，特别是缺乏动力设备的困难。
    双轮双铧犁已有了多种用途。在改装为畜力收割机以后，有的还改装为小平车用来运输，最近又改装为单铧双层深耕犁。原来主要用于耕地的拖拉机，现在都向多种作业方面发展，而且在农业生产的间隙时间，用来抽水灌溉、运输、轧花、磨面和压碾水利工程的土坝。
    记者从有关部门获悉：目前，陕西省在农业大跃进和地方工业大发展中出现的新情况，一方面是广大农村需要大量的各种机械，但供不应求；另一方面是现有的农业机械因用途单一和农业季节性影响，利用率很低。全省的国营机器拖拉机站和农场，拥有拖拉机、汽车、康拜因、发电机四百七十五部，共有一万六千八百七十一马力，但是一般利用率都低。主要耕作动力的拖拉机，在耕作播种较多的关中地区，每年一般使用五个月到六、七个月；在一年只种一季的陕北地区，使用时间还占不到一年的三分之一。其它如不同的播种机、收割机等，都因用途单一或不适用，使用率很低，有的几乎完全闲置着。以利用率较高的长安斗门拖拉机站为例，一年内用于耕种的时间，约有五个月多。设置着的一个八瓩发电机，只带动一个皮带车床、一个电钻和一个沙轮。这部发电机只在修理时间开动，被带动的三个机器常常不是同时使用。一个六十马力的康拜因收割机，今年只割了二百亩小麦、脱粒一万斤，全年等于闲置。但附近农业社又缺乏磨面、轧花的动力。棉花、玉米、小麦等播种机各有一套，事实上只要稍加改装，种完棉花后还可以用来播种玉米。其他如圆盘耙、灭茬犁、连接器等，都因不适用，又没有设法改装利用，长期闲置。大荔机耕农场的选种机，一年只用几个小时。
    现有农村机械的综合利用，正是解决农村需要大量机械与供不应求的矛盾的一种办法。农业技术革命需要制造和供应大量的农业机械，但由于生产等种种条件，还需要一定时间。如果充分发挥现有机械和人才的作用，使现有农村中各种机械综合利用，马上就能解决很大的问题。全省农村已有和马上要推广的双轮双铧犁共十万多部，收割时稍加改装，等于增加了十万多部收割机。运输时再稍加修改，又等于增加了十万部轻便小车。如果再根据各时农业劳动需要，改装为播种、中耕等机械，就可以节省出大批人力、畜力。长安县斗门拖拉机站的工人，三昼夜给附近农业社把一百部双轮双铧犁改装为单铧双层深耕犁，及时解决了深耕问题。全省所有拖拉机站和国营农场共有二百多个修理工人和二十一部车床和钻床，如果都在生产间隙时间充分利用，等于增加了近三十个小型机械修配厂。全省过去建成的连同最近新建成的所有拖拉机站、农场、抽水站、小型水力发电站，共拥有动力设备达二万四千六百多马力，除去原来的工作量，加上必要的机器保养、检修时间，每年平均以半年的闲置时间用来投入农产品加工，约可带动二万六千多个小型动力轧花机，共可轧近一百亿斤皮棉，等于三亿二千万个人的劳动日。过去，延安拖拉机站驾驶员，曾因作业少，闲得闹情绪。如果全省上述单位的五千三百多个驾驶员、修理工人和技术工人，都利用工作的间隙时间，投入农村技术革命和发展地方工业，将会发生很大的作用。
    从目前情况看，农业机械的综合利用中还存在下述三个问题需要解决。第一是思想问题。当前，有些群众、干部开始以综合利用来解决农村各种机械不足与供不应求的矛盾，但有关部门对这一问题还重视不够。一般都注意增购机械，没有更好的注意使用。一些动力机械本来可以有多种用途，但不少人都看成抽水的只可以抽水，耕种的只可以耕种，没有设法在空闲时间用于其他方面。虽然群众已经不断改装双轮双铧犁，使其综合利用，走向万能；但有关部门还没有考虑到如何吸收群众这些创造，在再制造中，使之成为万能农具。
    第二，协作问题。综合利用需要各有关单位协作，但目前因各单位各搞一套，主动协作不够，影响着综合利用。水利厅专门管理全省抽水站、小型水力发电站，而拖拉机站、国营农场又由农业厅领导，如要综合利用，把空闲的动力用来帮助各地举办地方工业，则需要与工业厅及其他部门进行协作，共同研究。
    第三，体制问题。从目前情况看，凡是群众办的，大多数综合利用较好，而过去主要是国家办的则综合利用较差。过去主要靠国家办的小型水电站部分的只用于照明，泾阳县等地群众自办的小型水电站除照明外，还用于轧花、磨面等作业上。国营拖拉机站也因为所有与使用不统一，双方作业不易衔接，因此一方面农业社有的活路尽量自己去作，拖拉机站机械又闲置未用。为了解决这个矛盾，今年小型水电站、抽水站都交群众去办，全省拖拉机站也拟把三分之一的拖拉机下放给农业社。
