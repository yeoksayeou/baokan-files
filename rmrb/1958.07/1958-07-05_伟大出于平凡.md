Greatness Comes from the Ordinary

The Man Who Created the Transit of Mercury Calculation Method

Wang Xichan was a young astronomer in the Qing Dynasty of China. He became interested in astronomy when he was young. At that time, he had no observation instruments. Every clear night, he lay on the roof and looked up at the stars, recording the changes in the celestial phenomena and constantly studying them. At the age of thirty-five, he wrote an astronomical work called "Xiao'an Calendar." In this work, Wang Xichan detailed the calculation method for the transit of Mercury. At that time, in the 17th century, he was the only person in the world who had conducted such research.

Who Created the Tongtian Pagoda?

Ji Tanran, who created the Tongtian Pagoda (large astronomical clock) in the Qing Dynasty, was a person who had not even formally studied simple mathematics. But when he saw a Western clock, he built a "Tongtian Pagoda" (large astronomical clock). The pagoda was divided into three layers. The lower layer contained more than twenty copper wheels that drove each other. The middle layer had a door in the front with a dial divided into twelve segments, indicating the twelve time periods. After the lower copper wheel was turned, a wooden child in the middle layer would jump out on time to indicate the time. The upper layer had a bronze bell that rang every quarter of an hour. This was based on accepting the legacy of water or sand clocks that have existed in China since ancient times, and at the same time referring to the gear configuration method inside Western clocks.

The Skillful Craftsman Who Built the Taihe Hall

The red-walled, green-tiled, and magnificent Qing Dynasty palaces that we see in Beijing today were all carefully built by construction workers at that time. Among them, the construction worker Liang Jiu made the greatest contribution. In the early Qing Dynasty, the construction of all the palaces within the imperial palace passed through his hands. Liang Jiu's contribution was even greater to the reconstruction of the Taihe Hall during the Kangxi period. At that time, Liang Jiu made a wooden palace model, with a total area of only a few square feet, but it was very detailed. All the key points of the construction were shown on the model. Now we also make models when planning an important building, and Liang Jiu had already adopted this scientific method at that time. Liang Jiu was an ordinary construction worker, but also a technically proficient construction engineer.

The Shepherd Boy Who Became an Orthopedic Expert

Song Bichen was a famous orthopedic expert in the early Qing Dynasty, but he had not attended any school. Because his family was poor, he herded sheep for others from a young age. When he grew up a little, he saved some money and wanted to do business, but he was defrauded. Unable to make a living, he fled to a Buddhist temple. The old monk in the temple was proficient in medicine, and Song Bichen devoted himself to learning medical theory from the old monk. Because he worked hard, he was able to practice medicine independently after a few years. The first time, he met a woman with a broken arm. He used what he had learned to massage the woman along the meridians. The broken arm recovered quickly. From then on, his experience became richer and richer, and his medical skills became higher and higher. He could even heal broken bones. Because he himself came from a poor background, he did not charge poor people for medical treatment.

    伟大出于平凡
    创造水星凌日计算法的人
    王锡阐是我国清朝时候的青年天文学家。他年轻时就对天文学有兴趣。当时他没有观测仪器，每逢晴天的晚上，他就躺在屋顶上仰看星斗，把天象的变动情况记录下来不断地进行研究。他在三十五岁的那年便写成了一部天文学著作“晓庵历法”。在这部著作里，王锡阐详细地记载了水星凌日的计算方法。那时是十七世纪中，全世界只有他一个人进行了这样的研究。
    通天塔是谁创制的？
    清代创制通天塔（大的时辰钟）的吉坦然，是一个连简单数学也没有正式学过的人。但是当他看到一个西洋钟后，便造了一个“通天塔”（大的时辰钟）。这塔分三层，下层内安放铜轮二十多个，互相带动；中层前面开一门，内有一盘分十二段，写明十二个时辰。下层铜轮拨动后，中层内有一木制小孩按时跳出来表明时刻。上层有一口铜钟，每刻报一响。这是一方面接受我国自古以来以水或砂漏的遗制，同时又参照西洋钟内齿轮配置的方法而制成的。
    修建太和殿的巧匠
    现在我们在北京看到的红墙绿瓦、金碧辉煌的清代宫殿，都是当时的建筑工人精心修建的。其中营造工人梁九的功绩最大。清初凡皇宫内的宫殿建造都经过他手，康熙年间重建的太和殿，梁九的功绩更大。当时梁九制造木殿模型一座，总共面积只几平方尺大，但很细致，一切建筑上的关键都在模型上表示了出来。现在我们规划一个重要建筑也先做成模型，而梁九在当时已采用这个科学的方法了。梁九是一普通建筑工人，也是一个精通技术的建筑工程师。
    牧童成了骨科专家
    宋弼宸是清初著名的骨科专家，可是他并没有上过什么学校。因为家里贫苦，他从小就替人放羊。到他稍长大时，曾积蓄了一些钱，正想去做生意，不料却被人讹诈了。他没法生活，就逃到一个和尚庙里去。庙里的老和尚精通医道，宋弼宸就专心地跟着老和尚学习医理。由于他刻苦钻研，过了几年，便能独立行医了。第一次，他便遇见一个手臂跌伤了的妇人，他就用学到的本领，替这位妇人顺着经脉，按摩了一番，跌伤的手臂很快就好了。从此以后，他的经验愈来愈丰富，医道愈来愈高，甚至骨头碎了的，他也能医好。因为他自己出身穷苦，所以他替穷人医病不要钱。
