Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, July 30th: Prominent Chinese scientists Li Siguang, Hou Debang, Liu Xianzhou, Li Fangxun, and others, who are currently recuperating in Qingdao, gathered on the 29th to angrily protest against the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British imperialism.

    The letter of protest passed at the meeting stated that the armed aggression of Lebanon and Jordan by US and British imperialism is an attack on the entire Arab people striving for independence and freedom and a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world, which has seriously threatened world peace.

    Li Siguang and others pointed out that the armed aggression of the Middle East by US and British imperialism is intolerable to the people of the world. They demanded that peace-loving people all over the world unite to support the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people, stop the war provocations of US and British imperialism, and defend peace in the Middle East and the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th: Well-known peace advocates, writers, and scientists in Tianjin expressed extreme indignation at the fact that US and British imperialism disregarded the protests and condemnations of people all over the world, continued to increase troops in the Middle East, and delayed and obstructed the convocation of the Five-Power Summit Conference proposed by the Soviet Union.

    Zhang Guofan, Vice-Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and a physicist, said that the aggressive actions of US and British imperialism in the Middle East are the most blatant manifestation of the ugly face of colonialism. In order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, we must hold higher the banner of the Five Principles and give the colonialists a severe blow.

    Yang Shixian, a famous chemist and President of Nankai University, stated in a letter of protest: He cannot tolerate the bandit behavior of US and British imperialists, who use their power to bully the weak, use force against the small, and use the big stick without reason. He said that we love peace, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are our guidelines for handling international relations. However, if the imperialists think we are weak and can be bullied and insist on provoking war, then death awaits them.

    Yu Yixuan, a female singer and Director of the Vocal Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, met many Arab friends when she attended the World Mothers' Conference in Lausanne in 1955. They confided in Yu Yixuan their deep resentment towards the colonialists. Yu Yixuan sincerely wished the Arab women an early victory in their just struggle against colonialism. Yu Yixuan said excitedly that now, just as the Arab people are raising the banner of justice, the imperialists are carrying out armed intervention. She said that as a mother, she will never allow the imperialists to trample on Arab women and children. Yu Aifeng, an expert in obstetrics and gynecology who attended the World Women's Conference in 1953, recalled the accusations made by the women representatives from Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon at that conference against the brutal plunder of the Middle East by US and British imperialism and their firm determination to fight for national independence. She pointed out that the armed aggression of Lebanon and other countries by US and British imperialism exposes the ugly faces of US and British imperialist colonialists.

    Li Jiye, a poet and professor at Nankai University, has written poems such as "Warning to Aggressors" and "The Power of the People Surpasses Everything" these past few days, condemning the aggressive behavior of US and British imperialists. He particularly pointed out that the US and British imperialists' obstruction of the convocation of the Five-Power Summit Conference proposed by the Soviet Union is openly being an enemy of peace and human happiness. He said, "We denounce the conspiracy of US and British imperialism and resolutely demand the immediate convocation of the Five-Power Summit Conference to save world peace and stop US and British aggression."

    知名和平人士和科学家谴责美英侵略者
    阻挠首脑会议就是与和平为敌
    新华社青岛30日电　正在青岛休养的中国著名科学家李四光、侯德榜、刘仙洲、李方训等，在29日集会愤怒抗议美、英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。
    会上通过的抗议书说，美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，是向整个争取独立和自由的阿拉伯人民的进攻，是向全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅，已经严重地威胁着世界的和平。
  李四光等人指出，美英帝国主义对中东的武装侵略是全世界人民不能容忍的，他们要求全世界爱好和平的人们团结起来，支持中东人民的正义斗争，制止美英帝国主义的战争挑衅，保卫中东和世界的和平。
    新华社天津30日电　天津市知名的和平人士、作家和科学家等对美英帝国主义无视全世界人民的抗议和谴责，继续增兵中东并且拖延和阻挠苏联提出的五国首脑会议的召开表示万分愤慨。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会副主席、物理学家张国藩说，美英帝国主义在中东的侵略行为是殖民主义者狰狞面目最露骨的表现。为了维护亚洲和全世界的和平，我们必须更加高举五项原则的旗帜，给殖民主义者严重的打击。
    著名化学家、南开大学校长杨石先在一份抗议书上表示：他不能容忍美英帝国主义者以大压小、以强凌弱、使用大棒不讲道理的强盗行为。他说，我们热爱和平，和平共处的五项原则是我们处理国际关系的准则，但是如果帝国主义以为我们软弱可欺，一定要挑起战争，那么等待他们的只有死路一条。
    女歌唱家、中央音乐学院声乐系主任喻宜萱1955年到洛桑参加世界母亲大会的时候，遇到很多阿拉伯朋友，他们向喻宜萱倾诉了自己对殖民主义者深恶痛绝的心情。喻宜萱当时曾衷心地祝阿拉伯妇女反殖民主义的正义斗争早日取得胜利。喻宜萱激动地说，现在正当阿拉伯人民举起正义的大旗，而帝国主义竟进行武装干涉。她说，她作为一个母亲，决不容许帝国主义蹂躏阿拉伯的妇女和儿童。曾出席1953年世界妇女大会的妇产科专家俞霭峰回忆了那次大会上伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩的妇女代表控诉美英帝国主义在中东的残酷掠夺和她们决心争取民族独立的坚强意志，她指出，美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩等国家的武装侵略，使美英帝国主义殖民主义者的丑恶面目暴露无遗。
    诗人、南开大学教授李霁野这几天接连写了“警告侵略者”、“人民的力量胜过一切”等诗歌谴责美英帝国主义者的侵略行为。他特别指出，美英帝国主义者百般阻挠苏联提议的五国首脑会议的召开，是明目张胆地与和平和人类幸福为敌。他说：“我们痛斥美英帝国主义的阴谋，坚决要求立即召开五国首脑会议，以拯救世界和平，制止美英的侵略。”
