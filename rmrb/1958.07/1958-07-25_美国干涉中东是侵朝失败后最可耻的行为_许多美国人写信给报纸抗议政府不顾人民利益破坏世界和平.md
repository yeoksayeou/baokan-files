Xinhua News Agency dispatch: American newspaper editorial departments continue to receive many letters from readers protesting the U.S. armed intervention in the Middle East. Some readers accuse the U.S. action of being a blatant act of imperialist interference in the internal affairs of small countries and undermining the prestige of the United Nations; most people are worried that the U.S. is pushing the whole world toward war.

    The "New York Post" published a letter from a reader named Bart, who said that Eisenhower's irresponsible act of sending troops to Lebanon "simply means leading us into World War III."

    The "Washington Post and Times Herald" published a protest letter signed by six people. The letter said: "We demand that the President immediately abandon the use of armed intimidation to deal with world problems. The President should stop undermining the prestige of the United Nations..."

    American Patriotism Means Opposing Foreign Aggression

    The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" editorial department received many letters from readers, all of whom condemned the U.S. intervention in Lebanon.

    A reader from Pasadena, California, named Inerest, posed the question: "If the Anglo-French military intervention in Egypt in 1956 was unreasonable and wrong, then why is armed intervention reasonable and right for us?"

    A reader from Schenectady, New York, named Broderick, wrote in a letter to the newspaper editorial department: "What will the excited world think of our unilateral, direct provocative actions near the Russian border, especially after the UN observers reported on the situation in Lebanon? How unreasonable is this reckless behavior, and how untenable are the reasons we cite for this behavior! Of course, this will not bring us anything except the hatred, contempt, and hostility of the neutral countries of the world, all of which comes from Dulles... He should not be given any trust in the future."

    The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" also published a letter from a reader signing as "Dissenter," who called on Americans to resolutely protest the government's actions. He said: "I believe that a high degree of loyalty and patriotism is to resolutely disagree with actions that threaten international peace, which cannot be justified by the allegation that the so-called revolution in this region is instigated by communism." He also accused the manufacturing of this excuse of "keeping (the situation) on the brink of war in the worst way."

    The U.S. Government Values Oil More Than People's Blood

    The Washington "Star" published a letter from a reader named Nelson. Nelson wrote in the letter that the U.S. military's open intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs is "wrong both morally and practically, and is undoubtedly the most shameful manifestation of the failed foreign policy of the United States since its aggression in Korea... The needs of the American people and the people of the world should be higher than the interests of certain oil companies investing in the Near East..."

    Another reader, signing as A.D.L., wrote in the "Star": "It seems that they value oil more than blood. We have no right to contain the rising tide of Arab nationalism..."

    Objo pointed out in a letter to the "Star" that the U.S. intervention in Lebanon is a restoration of "gunboat diplomacy" and "rule by force."

    "Massive Retaliation Policy" Inevitably Leads to Disaster

    Even the "Wall Street Journal," which is read entirely by bourgeois figures, published many protest letters against the intervention. A reader of this newspaper, Magillis, wrote that the U.S. intervention "will only bring us the hatred of the people of the Middle East... I think this wrong step is the inevitable result of our entire Middle East policy."

    Grosch from Grosshoe, California, condemned the U.S. intervention as "the most blatant act of aggression, which, without a doubt, we would condemn as intolerable and unimaginable if it came from other countries."

    Sutterfen wrote in a letter from Minneapolis to the "Wall Street Journal" editorial department: "It is unimaginable to use force to influence the resolution of other countries' internal problems."

    In addition, many other readers expressed the same views.

    Reader Dudley specifically pointed out: "The policy of massive retaliation, which has been declared as the international policy of the United States, is a policy of constant international struggle, it lacks consideration, and will ultimately lead to atomic catastrophe."

    The U.S. Has No Right to Interfere in the Internal Affairs of Other Countries

    The San Francisco "Chronicle" published Grosso's letter, in which he asked: "What kind of human order principles give us the right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, simply because they have some differences with us? ... We do not need to defend Lebanon from 'armed aggression' at all. We are using weapons merely to insist on keeping the people of the Middle East under the rule of those governments that are in our interest, even if the people of these countries have expressed the opposite wish."

    According to a report in an Austin, Texas newspaper, a group of students at the University of Texas organized a petition drive on campus, condemning the "unjustified interference of the U.S. military in the internal affairs of Lebanon."

### 美国干涉中东是侵朝失败后最可耻的行为  许多美国人写信给报纸抗议政府不顾人民利益破坏世界和平

专栏：

    美国干涉中东是侵朝失败后最可耻的行为
    许多美国人写信给报纸抗议政府不顾人民利益破坏世界和平
    据新华社讯　美国报纸编辑部继续收到很多抗议美国武装干涉中东的读者来信。有些读者指责美国的行动是粗暴地干涉小国内政的帝国主义行为，并且破坏了联合国的威信；大部分人担心美国正在把全世界推向战争。
    “纽约邮报”刊载的一个读者巴特的来信说，艾森豪威尔派军队到黎巴嫩这种不负责任的行为“简直就意味着把我们引到第三次世界大战”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”刊载了一封有六个人签名的抗议信。信中说：“我们要求总统立刻放弃用武装恐吓来对待世界问题。总统应该停止破坏联合国威信的行为………”。
    美国人民的爱国主义就是反对对外侵略
    “圣路易邮报”编辑部收到了许多读者的来信，他们一致谴责美国对黎巴嫩的干涉。
    加利福尼亚州派沙迪纳的一位读者因讷尔斯特提出这样一个问题：“如果1956年英法对埃及的军事干涉是无理的和错误的，那么为什么武装干涉对我们说来又是合理的和正确的呢？”
    纽约州斯堪奈克特迪的一位读者布罗德里克在给报纸编辑部的信中写道；“对我们单方面的、直接在俄国边境附近的挑衅行为，特别是在联合国观察员作了关于黎巴嫩情况的报告以后采取这种行动，激动的全世界会有什么想法呢？这种鲁莽的行为是何等无理，而我们为这种行为所引证的理由是多么站不住脚啊！当然这不会给我们带来任何东西，除了世界中立国家的憎恨、轻视和敌意以外，所有这一切事情都是出自杜勒斯的手……对他今后不应给予任何的信任。”
    “圣路易邮报”还刊载了一封署名“不同意者”的读者来信，他号召美国人坚决抗议政府的行为。他说：“我认为，高度的忠诚和爱国主义就是坚决不同意威胁国际和平的行为，这种行为不能以所谓这个地区的革命是由共产主义煽动起来的这种非难作为辩解。”他并且指责制造这种借口“是用最坏的方式（把局势）保持在战争边缘上”。
    美国政府把石油看得比人民的血还宝贵
    华盛顿“明星报”刊登了读者纳尔逊的一封信。纳尔逊在信中写道：美国军队公开干涉黎巴嫩内政的“举动无论从道义上还是从实际上来看都是不对的，并且毫无疑问是美国从侵略朝鲜起就遭到失败了的外交政策上的最可耻的表现……美国人民和世界各国人民的需要应该高于在近东进行投资的某些石油公司的利益……”
    另一署名A·D·L的读者在“明星报”上写道：“似乎，他们把石油看得比血还宝贵。我们没有权利遏止阿拉伯民族主义正在高涨的浪潮……。”
    奥布乔在给“明星报”的信中指出，美国干涉黎巴嫩是恢复“炮舰外交”和“暴力统治”。
      “大规模报复政策”必然导致灾难
    甚至完全是资产阶级人士所阅读的“华尔街日报”也刊载了许多反对干涉的抗议信。这家报纸的读者马吉利斯写道，美国的干涉“只会给我们带来中东人民的憎恨……我认为这个错误的步骤是我们整个中东政策的必然结果”。
    加利福尼亚州格罗斯霍谴责美国的干涉是“最明目张胆的侵略行为，毫无疑问，这种侵略如果来自其他国家，我们将谴责为不能容忍和难以想像的”。
    萨特芬在从明尼阿波利斯写给“华尔街日报”编辑部的信中说：“利用武力来影响其它国家内部问题的解决，是不可想像的”。
    此外还有其他许多读者也表示了同样的意见。
    读者达德利特别指出：“被宣布作为美国国际政策的大规模报复政策，是一种经常进行国际斗争的政策，它缺乏考虑，最终必然导致原子灾祸。”
      美国没有权利干涉其他国家的内政
    旧金山“纪事报”刊载了格罗索的信，他问道：“怎样的人类秩序的准则给我们权利去干涉其它国家的内政、而仅仅是由于他们同我们有些分歧？……我们根本不用保卫黎巴嫩不受‘武装侵略’，我们动用武器仅仅是为了坚持使中东的人民继续处于那些符合我们利益的政府的统治之下，即使这些国家的人民表示了相反的愿望”。
    据得克萨斯州奥斯汀报纸报道，有一批得克萨斯州大学的大学生在学校范围内组织在请愿书上征集签名的工作，请愿书谴责“美国军队无理干涉黎巴嫩内政”。
