Editor's Note: In the past four days, our newspaper has received over 1,700 letters from readers protesting against the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. Some letters are protests on behalf of hundreds, or even thousands, of people. These tens of thousands of readers, including people from all walks of life, unanimously and firmly condemn the aggressive acts of US and British imperialism. Readers in Kunming, Chengdu, Changchun and other places have also sent telegrams specifically to express their anger and protest. Now we publish some of the protest letters as follows:

	The US and British Aggressor Troops Must Immediately Withdraw from the Middle East
	The US and British aggressor troops, under the orders of their governments, have entered the territory of Lebanon and Jordan, blatantly carrying out armed intervention against the people of Lebanon and Jordan. We firmly condemn and protest against this barbaric action by the US and Britain that disregards international law and violates humanitarianism.
	US imperialists often pretend to love peace and respect the independence and autonomy of other countries, but their armed aggression has shamelessly torn off this mask. People see clearly that it is this group of warmongers with the hearts of jackals, who call themselves peace-lovers, who are invading other countries and destroying peace. The US imperialists’ brutal acts of aggression cannot be justified by any nonsense. The sovereignty of Lebanon should be in the hands of the Lebanese people themselves, and does not need the "concern" of the United States, which is tens of thousands of miles away, through acts of aggression.
	The US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan threatens the security and peace of the entire Arab people, as well as the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. Opposing US aggression is not only a matter for the Arab people, but also a matter for the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. We warmly support our government’s statement against US and British armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and we are determined to support the just struggle of the Arab people with all our strength.
	Red Cross workers have the task of battlefield rescue, but we do not want to see war occur in any region. However, if someone is subjected to armed aggression, we will follow the humanitarian spirit we uphold and support them in opposing the war of aggression. This is our responsibility. We will never abandon our due responsibilities.
	The US and British armed aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan!

				Lin Shixiao, Peng Yan, Liu Qingyang, Ni Feijun
	If the Acts of Aggression Do Not Stop, Our Struggle Will Not End
	We are extremely angry upon hearing the news of US and British armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan. US imperialism has always been the mortal enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. Now, just as the people of Iraq have overthrown the rule of the Faisal puppet dynasty and established the Republic of Iraq, US imperialism, together with British aggressors, is taking armed intervention and openly invading the Arab people. This is absolutely intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. We firmly protest against this aggressive act by US and British imperialism and firmly support the solemn statements of our government and the Soviet government. We once again warn US and British imperialists that they must immediately withdraw their intervention troops from the Middle East. We are determined to use all our strength to support the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle. If the imperialists' aggressive acts do not stop, we will never give up!

	Those Who Play with Fire Will Burn Themselves
	As we were celebrating the establishment of the revolutionary government in Iraq, the guns of the US imperialists' Sixth Fleet and the bayonets of the executioners were pointed at the Lebanese people, and British troops also openly invaded Jordan. In order to prevent the disaster of the people of Port Said from falling on the Arab people again, and for the peace of the world, we protest against US and British armed intervention in the Middle East!
	We warn the bosses of Wall Street that the days when the people of the Middle East were enslaved and slaughtered are gone forever. The people of Asia and Africa have stood up like a giant. Today's era is no longer an era in which you war maniacs can do whatever you want, but an era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. If you dare to disregard the just condemnation and angry protests of the people all over the world and continue to impose war on the people of the Middle East, then those who play with fire will burn themselves, and the iron fists of the Arab people will, like the iron fists of the Korean and Egyptian people, beat you until your heads are broken and your bones are shattered!

	The US and British Aggressors Will Inevitably Suffer a Shameful Defeat
	We protest with utmost anger against the barbaric aggression of US and British imperialism against Lebanon and Jordan. Everyone agrees that the Lebanese people's struggle against the Shamun government is entirely an internal affair of Lebanon and no foreign interference is allowed. However, US imperialism openly violates international law, disregards the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, and carries out armed aggression against Lebanon. This fully exposes the ugly face of US imperialism as a warmonger.
	We firmly support the statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments, fully sympathize with and fully support the just struggle of the Arab people, and demand that the US aggressor troops immediately get out of the Middle East. We believe that with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the US and British aggressors will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

	Resolutely Stop Imperialist War Provocations
	Disregarding the public outrage of the people all over the world, US and British imperialism brazenly invaded Lebanon and Jordan. This is a complete act of aggression. All comrades of the Spare-Time Performance Team of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Sanatorium resolutely support the struggle of the Arab people, welcome the establishment of the Iraqi revolutionary government, and firmly demand that US and British troops immediately get out of the Middle East and are not allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern people.
	In this spare-time performance team composed of forty-two people, 90% of the comrades personally fought against the so-called "ace troops" "US 2nd Division" and "US 7th Division" of US imperialism in the just War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. We deeply realize that the United States is just a paper tiger. Listen to what Du Shuangquan, a 58-year-old veteran and Second-Class Meritorious Revolutionary Disabled Soldier from our team, said: "On December 20, 1950, in the Battle of Huangcaoling in Korea, our rifle squad defended a small position on the south bank of the Datong River. The American devils increased their forces from a company to a battalion and attacked us for two days and two nights, but they were all beaten back by us. Later, they used tanks to attack our squad. After we destroyed the first tank of the American devils, the devils behind rolled and crawled away. We finally won the victory in this battle."
	We solemnly warn the US and British warmongers: The struggle of the Middle Eastern people is by no means isolated, and their struggle has already received the support of peace-loving people all over the world. The peace-loving people of the world will never allow imperialism to be domineering again. If they do not give up their aggressive ambitions, they will eventually suffer a shameful defeat.

	We Support the Arab People
	We are all the members of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, collective farmers of the Mao Zedong era. We were extremely angry when we heard the news that US and British imperialism had invaded Lebanon and Jordan by armed force, attempting to use force to interfere in Iraq. We fully support our government's statement. We firmly condemn this aggressive act by US and British imperialism. We warn the imperialists: immediately stop all acts of aggression, do not interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and withdraw your troops from Lebanon and Jordan! We will definitely use all our strength to support the Arab people's just struggle against aggression until complete victory is achieved.
					All Members of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative, Haidian District
	No Interference in Lebanon and Jordan
	US imperialists dare to disregard the opposition of world public opinion and, under the pretext of so-called "protecting American侨民" and "defending Lebanese sovereignty," send troops to interfere in Lebanon by armed force, and British aggressor troops have also successively invaded Jordan. We feel extremely angry about this aggressive act!
	This aggressive act by the US and Britain not only interferes in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan, but is also a serious provocation to peace-loving people all over the world. We firmly support our government's statement and fully support the just struggle of the Arab people! The US and British aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from the Middle East.

	The Lesson of History Is That Aggressors Will Be Defeated
	The East wind has once again prevailed over the West wind. The revolution of the Iraqi people has triumphed, and it has encouraged the national liberation struggle of the Lebanese people and the Arab people. The hideous faces of US and British imperialists can no longer be covered up, and they have stretched out their bloody claws of aggression. However, the lessons of history should be learned: those who are badly battered and burnt will not be others, but the aggressors themselves. The Anglo-French invasion of Egypt two years ago is proof of this!
	Sending troops to land in Lebanon, trampling on the land and people of Lebanon, and suppressing the uprising of the Lebanese people, from ten thousands of miles away from the United States, fully proves the aggressive face of US imperialism. All staff of the sixteen nationalities of our Nationalities Publishing House feel extremely angry and resolutely warn the US aggressors to get out of Lebanon immediately!
						All Staff of Nationalities Publishing House
	The American Paper Tiger Cannot Scare People!
	We protest with the greatest anger against the armed intervention of US and British imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan!
	US imperialism's march into Lebanon under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese is an attempt to strangle the Lebanese people's struggle for national independence, and a threat to the people of Iraq and the Arab world, and a blatant provocation to peace in the Middle East and the world!
	We firmly support our government's statement. US and British troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan! We firmly support the just struggle of the Lebanese and Arab people.
	We fully believe that the heroic Arab people will achieve complete victory with the support of the people all over the world. The American paper tiger cannot scare people!
			All Communist Youth League Members and Youth of the Education Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery
	Withdraw Troops Immediately!
	Just as the world situation is in a state where the East wind is prevailing over the West wind, the people of Iraq have freed themselves from the enslavement of imperialism and achieved revolutionary victory. This is a new victory in the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism. But when we saw the news that US and British imperialism was planning armed intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq, and learned that US imperialism had already sent troops to land in Lebanon, all our comrades were extremely angry. We warn the imperialists that they should remember the shameful end of their invasion of Korea and Egypt, and get out of Lebanon immediately!

专栏：

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    编者按  四天来，本报已接到读者一千七百多件来信，抗议美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。有些信是代表几百人、甚至代表几千人的抗议书。这成千上万的读者，包括各阶层人士，一致坚决地谴责美英帝国主义的侵略行为。昆明、成都、长春等地的读者，还特地打电报来，表示他们的愤怒和抗议。现在我们把一部分抗议书刊登如下：
        美英侵略军必须立即退出中东
    美英侵略军队奉他们政府的命令开进了黎巴嫩和约旦的国土，公然对黎巴嫩和约旦人民进行武装干涉，我们坚决谴责和抗议美英这种不顾国际法律和违背人道的横蛮行动。
    美帝国主义者常常装做爱好和平，尊重别国的独立自主的样子，而他们的武装侵略行动，却毫无掩饰地撕下了这块假面具。人们看清楚了，侵略别的国家，破坏和平的，正是这群长着豺狼心眼自称和平爱好者的战争贩子。美帝国主义者的横暴侵略行动，是任何胡说八道都辩护不了的。黎巴嫩的主权，要由黎巴嫩人民自己掌握，用不着远在十万八千里之外的美国以侵略行动来加以“关心”。
    美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行动，威胁了整个阿拉伯人民以及亚非和世界人民的安全与和平。反对美国侵略，不止是阿拉伯人民的事情，也是亚非和世界人民的事情。我们热烈拥护我国政府关于反对美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的声明，决心以全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    红十字工作者有战地救护的任务，但我们不愿意看到在任何地区发生战争。然而，如果有人遭到了武装侵略，我们就会遵循我们所奉行的人道主义精神，支持他们去反对侵略战争。这是我们的责任。我们决不放弃自己应尽的责任。
    美英武装侵略部队，必须立即退出黎巴嫩和约旦！

              林士笑、彭  炎、刘清扬、倪斐君
      侵略行为不止，我们的斗争不罢休
    我们听到美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的消息，感到无比愤怒。美帝国主义者从来就是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。现在正当伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔卖国王朝的统治、建立了伊拉克共和国的时候，美帝国主义竟同英国侵略者采取武装干涉，对阿拉伯人民进行公开侵略，这是全世界爱好和平的人民绝对不能容忍的。我们坚决抗议美英帝国主义这种侵略行为，坚决拥护我国政府和苏联政府的严正声明。我们再一次警告美英帝国主义者，必须立即从中东撤出它的干涉军队。我们坚决用全力来支援阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争，帝国主义者的侵略行为若不停止，我们绝不罢休！

    玩火者必自焚
    当我们正在欢庆伊拉克革命政府成立的同时，美帝国主义的第六舰队的炮口和刽子手的刺刀，指向了黎巴嫩人民，英国军队也公然侵入约旦。为了不使塞得港人民的灾难重新再落到阿拉伯人民的头上，为了全世界的和平，我们抗议美英的武装干涉中东！
    我们警告华尔街的老板们，中东人民任人奴役任人宰割的时代已经一去不复返了，亚非人民已经像一个巨人一样站起来了，今天的时代再也不是你们这些战争狂人为所欲为的时代，而是东风压倒西风的时代。如果你们胆敢不顾全世界人民的正义谴责和愤怒的抗议，继续把战争强加在中东人民的头上，那么玩火者必自焚，阿拉伯人民的铁拳也会像朝鲜、埃及人民的铁拳一样，会把你们打得头破血流，粉身碎骨！
                                    北京大学全体穆斯林
        美英侵略者必将遭到可耻失败
    我们以无比愤怒的心情抗议美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的野蛮侵略。大家一致认为，黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙政府的斗争，完全是黎巴嫩的内政问题，绝不容许外国干涉。但美帝国主义公然违反国际法，不顾全世界爱好和平人民的反对，对黎巴嫩进行武装侵略，这就完全暴露了美帝国主义好战的丑恶面貌。
    我们坚决拥护中苏两国政府的声明，完全同情并全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，要求美国侵略军队立即从中东滚出去。我们相信，在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，美英侵略者必将遭到可耻的失败。

        坚决制止帝国主义的战争挑衅
    美英帝国主义不顾全世界人民的公愤，悍然侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，这是一次十足的侵略行为。我们四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队全体同志坚决声援阿拉伯人民的斗争，欢迎伊拉克革命政府的成立，坚决要求美英军队立刻滚出中东，不准干涉中东人民的内政。
    我们由四十二人组成的这支课余演出队中，有90％的同志在正义的抗美援朝战争中亲身同美帝国主义的所谓“王牌军”的“美二师”、“美七师”较量过，我们深深地体会到美国是只纸老虎。请听我们队的一位五十八岁的老战士、革命残废军人二等功臣杜双全说的话：“1950年12月20日，在朝鲜的黄草岭战役中，我们一个步枪班坚守大同江的南岸一个小阵地，美国鬼子由一个连增加到一个营的兵力，向我们进攻了两天两夜，都被我们打下去了。后来他们用坦克向我们班攻击，当我们消灭了美国鬼子的第一辆坦克之后，后面的鬼子就连滚带爬地退却了。我们终于取得了这次战役的胜利。”
    我们正告美英战争贩子们：中东人民的斗争，绝不是孤立的，他们的斗争已经得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持。全世界爱好和平的人民，绝不许帝国主义再横行霸道了，如果他们不放弃侵略野心，必将最后遭到可耻的失败。
            四川省革命残废军人教养院课余演出队全体同志
          我们支援阿拉伯人民
    我们是北京市郊区红光农业社的全体社员，是毛泽东时代的集体农民。我们听到美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，企图使用武力干涉伊拉克的消息后，真是万分愤怒。我们完全拥护我国政府的声明。我们坚决谴责美英帝国主义的这种侵略行为，我们警告帝国主义：立即停止一切侵略行为，不许干涉中东国家内政，把军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出去！我们一定用全力支援阿拉伯人民反侵略的正义斗争，直至取得完全胜利为止。
                              海淀区红光农业社全体社员
          不许干涉黎巴嫩和约旦
    美国帝国主义者竟敢不顾世界舆论的反对，在所谓“保护美国侨民”和“保卫黎巴嫩主权”的借口下，出兵武装干涉黎巴嫩，而英国侵略军也相继侵入约旦，对这种侵略行为，我们感到无比的愤怒！
    美英的这种侵略行为不仅干涉了黎巴嫩和约旦的内政，更是向全世界爱好和平的人民进行的一次严重挑衅。我们坚决拥护我国政府的声明，全力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争！美英侵略军必须立即撤出中东。

          历史的教训是侵略者必败
    东风又一次压倒了西风，伊拉克人民的革命胜利了，它鼓舞了黎巴嫩人民和阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争。美英帝国主义者的狰狞面目再也掩盖不住，它伸出了侵略的血爪。但是，历史的教训应该吸取：碰得头破血流，烧得焦头烂额的决不是别人，而是侵略者自己，两年前的英法侵埃事件就是证明！
    在远离美国十万八千里之外，派兵登陆黎巴嫩，蹂躏黎巴嫩的土地和人民，镇压黎巴嫩人民的起义，这铁的事实充分证明了美帝国主义的侵略面目。我们民族出版社十六个民族的全体工作人员感到万分愤怒，坚决地警告美国侵略者，立刻从黎巴嫩滚出去！
                                  民族出版社全体工作者
        美国纸老虎是吓不倒人的！
    我们以最大的愤怒，抗议美英帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦！
    美帝国主义以保护侨民为借口进军黎巴嫩，是企图扼杀黎巴嫩人民争取民族独立的斗争，是对伊拉克和阿拉伯人民的恫吓，是对中东和世界和平的明目张胆的挑衅！
    我们坚决拥护我国政府的声明。美英军队必须立刻撤出黎巴嫩和约旦！我们坚决支持黎巴嫩和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。
    我们完全相信英勇的阿拉伯人民在全世界人民的支援之下，会取得完全胜利，美国纸老虎是吓不倒人的！
                    第一机械部教育局全体共青团员和青年
            立即撤军！
    正当世界局势处于东风压倒西风之际，伊拉克人民摆脱了帝国主义的奴役，取得了革命的胜利。这是亚非人民反对殖民主义斗争的一个新胜利。可是当我们看到美英帝国主义在策划武装干涉伊拉克内政的消息，知道美帝国主义已经派兵在黎巴嫩登陆后，我们全体同志万分愤怒。我们警告帝国主义者，应当记得侵朝、侵埃的可耻下场，立即滚出黎巴嫩！
