Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 20th: The three major water conservancy projects in the Huaian area of northern Jiangsu Province—the Erhe Sluice Gate, the Suqian Sluice Dam Control Project, and the Zhumatou Hub Project—have recently been completed.

    The Erhe Sluice Gate project is the most technically demanding sluice dam project in the Huai River diversion project. It is the inlet of the Huaishu New River, which is currently under construction. After the excavation of the Huaishu New River is completed, about one-third of the Huai River's flow, which has been flowing south into the Yangtze River through Hongze Lake for more than 800 years, will change its historical direction and flow north and east through the Erhe Sluice Gate into the Huaishu New River. When necessary, it can also divert floodwaters from the Yi River flowing downstream through the Grand Canal into Hongze Lake. This not only eliminates the threat of frequent flooding caused by large floods from the upper reaches of the Huai River every summer, which the waterway into the Yangtze River cannot discharge in time, but also enables 12 million mu of farmland in the Xuhuai area to make full use of Huai River irrigation and develop into a new self-flowing irrigation rice area.

    The Lianshui Zhumatou Hub Project is part of the Huai River diversion and Yi River diversion project. After the Huai River is diverted, a portion of the flow is injected into the Yan River, which can control the water level of the Yan River. When irrigation water is needed, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yan River is raised, so that 2.5 million mu of farmland on both sides of the Yan River can obtain irrigation water sources, and it can also be used to develop power stations and shipping.

    The Suqian Sluice Dam Control Project is the first phase of the Luoma Lake Great Control Project. After the completion of this project and other projects, the flood control level of Luoma Lake will be raised by three meters, and the safe discharge capacity of the Xinyi River will be increased from the original 2,900 cubic meters per second to 5,200 cubic meters per second, turning Luoma Lake into a comprehensive water conservancy project for flood control, irrigation, hydropower, and aquaculture. At the same time, the area west of the Huaishu New River and both sides of the Xuzhou Grand Canal will also be transformed into a rich land of fish and rice.

    These three major projects are the first phase of the Huai River diversion, the Yi River diversion, and the Luoma Lake Great Control Project, and were started one after another in the winter of last year.

### 江苏北部淮阴地区  三大水利枢纽工程竣工

    江苏北部淮阴地区
    三大水利枢纽工程竣工
    新华社南京20日电  江苏省北部淮阴地区三大水利枢纽工程——二河闸、宿迁闸坝控制工程和朱码头枢纽工程最近全部竣工。
    二河闸工程，是淮水北调的闸坝工程中技术要求最高的工程。它是正在施工的淮沭新河的进水口。在淮沭新河开凿完成后，八百多年来一直是经过洪泽湖向南入江的淮河水流，将有三分之一左右的流量改变历史流向，通过二河闸入淮沭新河向北、向东流去。必要时，还可以把分泄沂河经中运河下泄的洪水引入洪泽湖。这样，不仅解除了每年夏季淮河上游来洪很大、入江水道排泄不及而经常造成洪水灾害的威胁，并且，使徐淮地区的一千二百万亩农田充分利用淮水灌溉，发展成为一个自流灌溉的新稻区。
    涟水朱码头枢纽工程，是淮水北调、分淮入沂工程的一部分。淮水北调后，一部分流量注入盐河，可以起控制盐河水位的作用。在需要灌溉用水时，就抬高盐河上游水位，使盐河两岸二百五十万亩农田得到灌溉水源，还可用于发展发电站和航运事业。
    宿迁闸坝控制工程，是骆马湖大控制的第一期工程。这一工程和其它一些工程完工后，使骆马湖防洪水位提高三公尺，并且使新沂河安全泄量由原二千九百秒公方增加到五千二百秒公方，把骆马湖变成一个防洪灌溉的水电、水产综合利用的水库。同时，还将使淮沭新河以西及徐州中运河两岸地区，变成富饶的鱼米之乡。
    这三大工程，是淮水北调、分淮入沂和骆马湖大控制工程的第一期工程，是在去年冬季先后动工的。
