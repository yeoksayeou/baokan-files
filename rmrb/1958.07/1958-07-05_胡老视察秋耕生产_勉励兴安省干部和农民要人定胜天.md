Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 4th: According to reports here, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, inspected autumn cultivation production work in rural areas of Xing'an Province on the 3rd. He asked the cadres and farmers there to establish the idea of "man can conquer nature" and to be determined to strive for a bumper late rice harvest.

Accompanying President Ho Chi Minh on the inspection were Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Nghiem Xuan Yem and Deputy Director Nguyen Manh Hong of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party.

When speaking to 2,500 cadres and farmers in Xing'an Province, President Ho Chi Minh put forward ten major points of production, namely: irrigation, fertilization, deep plowing, close planting, selection of good seeds, improvement of agricultural technology, drought and flood prevention, development and consolidation of mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives, unity and launch of production competition, and strengthening of leadership.

In his speech, President Ho Chi Minh also listed many advanced experiences in China's agricultural production. He called on everyone to learn from these experiences.

President Ho Chi Minh said that Xing'an Province suffered the most severe drought this year in the early rice season, but thanks to the efforts of the people and cadres to fight the drought, the province planted 30,000 hectares more rice than in 1954, and harvested nearly 20,000 tons of grain and a large amount of miscellaneous grains.

President Ho Chi Minh then pointed out that there were still some shortcomings in early rice production. In order to strive for a bumper late rice harvest, everyone must earnestly establish the idea of "man can conquer nature." President Ho Chi Minh said he believed that the farmers and cadres of Xing'an Province would be motivated and determined to strive for a bumper late rice harvest.

Many agricultural models and farmers also expressed their opinions one after another, guaranteeing that they would go back and mobilize everyone to resolutely implement this instruction.

President Ho Chi Minh presented commemorative medals to seventeen villages and mutual aid teams that had overfulfilled their late rice production quotas last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 4th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published on its front page a photo of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, holding a fly swatter and exterminating flies in the garden of his residence. The Vietnam News Agency reported today that a city-wide campaign to eliminate flies is currently underway in Hanoi.
