Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The great rectification movement in central state organs, which has lasted for more than a year, is nearing its end. The Central State Organs Party Committee recently inspected the progress of the movement and once again proposed to carry it through to the end, persevere to the end, and strive for complete victory. At the same time, it requested all organs to immediately prepare to summarize the experience of the rectification movement so as to use the spirit and experience of rectification to promote future technological and cultural revolutions.

**The Road to a Comprehensive Great Leap Forward Cannot Be Paved Without a Complete Victory in Rectification**

The Central State Organs Party Committee convened a meeting of the heads of the rectification leading groups of various units on the 11th to inspect and arrange the rectification movement. According to statistics, 40% of the division and bureau units have completed the red and expert great debates of the fourth stage of rectification, 50% of the units are conducting red and expert debates, and 10% of the units have not yet entered the fourth stage of rectification. It is expected that by the end of July, 90% of the division and bureau units in the central state organs will have completed the rectification movement.

The meeting pointed out that the development of the rectification movement is uneven, and even in advanced units, there are many backward phenomena. For example, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is an advanced unit in the rectification movement, but according to the ministry's recent re-examination, the number of people who did not participate or participated intermittently in the rectification movement (including those who did not participate in the red and expert debates) accounted for 23%, and another 5% to 10% of the remaining problems have not been resolved. The meeting believed that this situation is relatively common, and it is necessary to emphasize once again that the rectification movement must be carried through to the end. Otherwise, without a complete victory, the road to a comprehensive Great Leap Forward cannot be paved in the future.

**Persist to the End; Conduct Re-examination and Make-Up Lessons; Thoroughly Resolve Major Problems Left Over Between Leading Cadres**

In order to strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, the Central State Organs Party Committee put forward three tasks: First, all units that have not entered the stage of heart-to-heart talks and red and expert debates must actively seize the time to carry them out. In particular, when most units are ending the rectification movement, these units must persist to the end and must not end the rectification hastily. Second, all units must conduct re-examination and make-up lessons carefully, so as to do a good job from beginning to end. The rectification should be examined from top to bottom and from bottom to top through the masses. Those who need to make up lessons should not hesitate to spend time to resolutely conduct make-up lessons. Some units have concentrated the personnel who were missed in the rectification movement to engage in theoretical studies, concentrate on conducting heart-to-heart talks and red and expert debates. This method can be adopted. In the re-examination, special attention should be paid to checking the phenomenon of "half-cooked rice" where the rectification movement is not thorough. Some units have gone through the motions of each stage of rectification in an "orderly manner," but have not solved practical problems, have not seen a new political situation, and have no drive for a leap forward. Such units must resolutely mobilize the masses to re-conduct rectification and make-up lessons. Thirdly, major problems left over between leaders at the ministry level and the division and bureau level, such as disunity and serious right-leaning, should be seized upon and thoroughly resolved in the rectification movement, openly and without evasion, otherwise they will hinder the leap forward in future work.

**There Must Be Specific Measures to Persist in Carrying the Rectification Through to the End, and There Should Be No Empty Slogans**

In order to thoroughly carry out the current heart-to-heart talks and red and expert debates, the meeting especially emphasized the need to strengthen specific leadership, to have a clear understanding, and to be good at enlightening and guiding, and to avoid shouting empty slogans of "persisting to the end" without concrete measures. In addition, in the heart-to-heart talks and red and expert debates, it is necessary to adhere to self-conscious revolution as the main thing and the help of others as a supplement. It is required to enlighten cadres to carry forward the spirit of communism, raise their awareness, and promote their own liberation, otherwise the red flag that is raised will not be firm. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that heart-to-heart talks and red and expert debates mainly recognize the past and are only the beginning of transformation, not the completion of transformation. The important issue is to earnestly implement the red and expert plans in the future and carry out continuous revolution on the road of ideological transformation. In heart-to-heart talks, it is necessary to grasp the most essential issues and not pursue those unimportant issues that can be talked about or not, not pursue forms, not label people arbitrarily, and pay attention to solving real ideological problems in a realistic manner. In the debate, on the one hand, it is necessary to distinguish between the two roads, and at the same time, it is necessary to grasp the main ideological trends and, through typical figures, profoundly criticize bourgeois individualism.

**After the Rectification, We Must Further Launch a High Tide of Technological Revolution and Cultural Revolution**

The meeting pointed out that in order to further launch a high tide of technological revolution and cultural revolution after the rectification movement, all organs must pay attention to summarizing the experience of the great rectification movement, and be prepared, have plans, and have measures for future movements, and implement the spirit and experience of rectification into future daily work. The meeting mentioned that the implementation of the General Line is itself a mass movement, and future regular work is a continuous revolutionary process of the masses. Therefore, consolidating the achievements of the rectification movement and summarizing and implementing the experience of the rectification movement are of great significance for promoting the Great Leap Forward in the future. Although the rectification is over, the spirit of rectification must be greatly carried forward in the future.

**The Five Measures of the Ministry of Coal Industry Have Important Reference Value**

The person in charge of the rectification leading group of the Ministry of Coal Industry introduced at the meeting the five measures they have proposed for consolidating the achievements of the rectification movement and implementing the spirit of rectification in the future. These measures have important reference value for all organs. These measures are:

First, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command in future work. Based on the experience of the rectification movement and considering the future situation, The Ministry of Coal Industry proposed to take appropriate organizational forms to strengthen the leadership of the Party committee over the work of the organs and strengthen the basic-level work of the Party. At the same time, it is necessary to establish the method of theoretical study as a regular system. Leaders at the division level and above should engage in theoretical study once a month, combining theoretical study with practical work, cultivating habits, and constantly liberating their minds. A heart-to-heart movement should be carried out every year to examine leadership, examine work, and examine oneself. The leadership of ideological transformation of intellectual cadres should be strengthened. All Party member leading cadres should do political and ideological work and report regularly to the masses on political and ideological work.

Second, take the form of movements to lead business. In order to promote the leap forward in the coal industry, the ministry will launch the "Five Contributions and Four Comparisons Movement" every year. The "Five Contributions" are to organize mass dedication movements on the five festivals of March 8th, May 1st, July 1st, October 1st, and New Year's Day. The "Four Comparisons" are to compare drive, compare style, compare contribution, and compare politics. From now on, the ministry plans to organize a total of twenty-two dedication movements during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, so that the technological revolution and cultural revolution movement will come one wave after another, and one wave will be higher than the other. In order to adapt to this situation, the ministry also plans to change the rectification office into a leap forward office.

Third, launch a movement to study Marxism-Leninism theory, especially the works of Chairman Mao. The Ministry of Coal Industry decided to establish a political study and research office, publish a theoretical journal, and organize Party member division and bureau chiefs and above to serve as theoretical teachers.

Fourth, fully develop socialist democracy. It is necessary to implement the socialist democratic methods of great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters into all work through airing of views forums and various regular meeting activities.

Fifth, improve working methods and formulate a working methods outline.

    整风临近结束　切防草率收兵
    复查补课消灭“夹生饭”
    中央国家机关党委提出争取整风全胜的三个任务
    新华社15日讯　中央国家机关历时一年多的伟大整风运动已临近结束阶段，中央国家机关党委最近检查了运动进行的情况，再一次提出要贯彻始终，把运动坚持到底，争取全胜；同时，要求各机关立即准备总结整风运动的经验，以便运用整风的精神和经验来推动今后的技术革命和文化革命。
    整风不获全胜就不能铺平全面大跃进的道路
    中央国家机关党委在11日召开了各单位整风领导小组组长会议，对整风运动进行了检查和布置。据统计，目前已经有40％的司局单位结束了整风第四阶段的红专大辩论，有50％的单位正在进行红专辩论，有10％的单位还没有进入整风第四阶段。预计到7月底，中央国家机关内90％的司局单位将要结束整风运动。
    会上指出，整风运动发展的情况是不平衡的，甚至先进的单位中也有很多落后的现象，例如冶金工业部是整风运动的先进单位，可是根据这个部最近的复查，没有参加和断断续续参加整风运动（包括没有参加红专辩论）的人数就占23％，另外还有5％到10％的遗留问题没有解决。会议认为，这种情况是比较普遍存在的，当前必须再一次强调把整风运动坚持到底，否则不获得全胜，就不能铺平今后全面大跃进的道路。
    坚持始终；进行复查补课；彻底解决领导干部间遗留的重大问题
    要争取整风运动的全胜，中央国家机关党委提出了三个任务：首先，凡是没有进入交心和红专辩论的单位，都要积极抓紧进行，特别是当大多数单位结束整风运动的时候，这些单位要坚持始终，不能草率结束整风。其次，所有单位都要认真进行复查补课，做到善始善终，要自上而下、自下而上地通过群众来检查整风，凡需要补课的要不惜时间坚决进行补课；有的单位把整风中漏掉的人员集中起来务虚，集中进行交心和红专辩论，这种作法可以采用；在复查中要求特别注意检查那些整风运动进行不彻底的“夹生饭”现象，有的单位在整风每一阶段都“按部就班”地走了过场，但是没有解决实际问题，没有出现新的政治局面，没有跃进的劲头，这样的单位必须坚决发动群众重新进行整风补课。再其次，一些部一级和司局一级领导干部间遗留的重大问题，例如不团结和严重右倾等问题，都应该抓紧时机，在整风运动中敞开门来彻底解决，不能躲躲闪闪，否则就会妨碍今后工作的跃进。
    要有把整风坚持到底的具体措施，不能空喊
    为了把当前的交心和红专辩论进行彻底，会议特别强调要加强具体领导，要心中有数，要善于启发引导，切忌空喊“坚持到底”而无具体措施。另外，在交心和红专辩论中要坚持以自觉革命为主，别人帮助为辅，要求启发干部发扬共产主义精神，提高觉悟，促使自己解放自己，否则树起的红旗就不会牢固。同时，要认清交心和红专辩论主要是认识了过去，只是改造的开始，不是改造的完成，重要的问题是今后要认真地执行红专规划，在思想改造的道路上进行不断革命。在交心中，要抓住最本质的问题，不要去追求那些可交可不交的不关重要的问题，不要追求形式，不要乱戴帽子，要注意实事求是地解决真实的思想问题。在辩论中，一方面要辩清两条道路，同时要抓住主要思想倾向和通过典型人物，深刻地批判资产阶级个人主义。
    整风之后要进一步掀起技术革命和文化革命的高潮
    会议指出，为了在整风运动之后进一步掀起技术革命和文化革命的高潮，各机关必须注意总结伟大整风运动的经验，对今后的运动要有准备、有计划、有措施，要把整风的精神和经验贯彻到今后日常工作中去。会上谈到，总路线的贯彻，它的本身就是一个群众运动，今后的经常工作就是一个群众的不断革命的过程，因此，巩固整风运动的成果，总结和贯彻整风运动的经验，对推动今后的大跃进有着重要的意义，整风虽然结束，而整风的精神要在今后大大发扬。
    煤炭部的五项措施，有重要参考价值
    煤炭工业部整风领导小组的负责人在会上介绍了他们为巩固整风运动的成果、今后贯彻整风的精神所提出的五项措施，这些措施对各机关有着重要的参考价值。这些措施是：
    第一、要在今后工作中坚持政治挂帅。根据整风运动的经验和考虑到今后的形势，煤炭工业部提出要采取适当的组织形式，加强党委对机关工作的领导，加强党的基层工作；同时要把务虚的方法订为经常的制度，处以上领导干部要每月务虚一次，虚实结合，养成习惯，不断解放思想；要每年开展一次交心运动，检查领导，检查工作，检查自己；要加强对知识分子干部思想改造的领导；要所有党员领导干部都作政治思想工作，定期向群众作政治思想工作的报告。
    第二、采取以运动的形式来领导业务。为了促进煤炭工业的跃进，这个部今后每年要开展“五献四比运动”，“五献”就是在三八、五一、七一、十一、元旦五个节日组织群众性的献礼运动，“四比”就是比干劲、比风格、比贡献、比政治。从现在开始，这个部准备在第二个五年计划时期内，共组织二十二次献礼运动，使技术革命和文化革命运动一浪接一浪，一浪比一浪高。为适应这种情况，这个部还准备把整风办公室改为跃进办公室。
    第三、掀起学习马克思列宁主义理论，特别是学习毛主席著作的运动。煤炭工业部决定成立政治学习研究室，出版一个理论刊物，并组织党员司局长以上干部担任理论教员。
    第四、充分发扬社会主义民主。要通过鸣放园地和各种定期的会议活动，把大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报等社会主义民主方法贯彻到一切工作中去。
    第五、改进工作方法，制定工作方法纲要。
