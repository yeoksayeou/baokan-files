Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: The successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite shows that the Soviet Union, using its existing fuel and rocket structure, can already enable satellites to break free from Earth's gravity. Moreover, compared to American satellites, this satellite capable of breaking free from Earth's gravity is quite large. This was stated by Soviet scientists Ilyushin and Lensky in "Izvestia" when answering questions from readers.

They believe that the significance of the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite in astronautics can be expressed as follows: "The flight of the Soviet Union's first two artificial Earth satellites marked the overcoming of the first cosmic barrier. The launch of the third satellite, weighing nearly one and a half tons, into an orbit extremely far from Earth signifies that our rocket technology can overcome the second cosmic barrier at any moment."

The authors said that overcoming the first cosmic barrier means being able to make an object orbit the Earth in a circular orbit. To do this, the rocket must have a speed of approximately eight kilometers per second (this is the so-called first cosmic velocity). To break free from Earth's gravity (so that the rocket can fly to the moon), it is necessary to overcome the second cosmic barrier, which means that the rocket must have a speed of eleven point two kilometers per second (this is the so-called second cosmic velocity).

The article stated that the Soviet Union's third satellite weighs one thousand three hundred and twenty-seven kilograms, so this satellite can easily be replaced by a rocket of the same weight. Thus, this rocket already has a speed of about eight kilometers per second before its engine starts. And when the rocket's engine finishes working, the rocket can have a speed greater than the second cosmic velocity.

The authors also pointed out that, like the Americans, launching rockets in the equatorial plane or a plane close to the equatorial plane in the direction of the Earth's rotation can give the rocket "free" additional speed of about half a kilometer per second, thereby sending the rocket to a farther orbit. However, such satellites can never reach places closer to the poles, nor can they reach vast latitudes. That is to say, in terms of the Earth's atmosphere, geomagnetism, solar radiation, and other phenomena in the cosmic and upper atmosphere, they can only provide extremely limited information on any point.

### 苏联火箭结构威力很大  能够取得第二宇宙速度

    苏联火箭结构威力很大
    能够取得第二宇宙速度
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联第三个人造卫星发射成功表明，苏联利用自己现有的燃料和火箭结构就已经可以使卫星摆脱地球引力的羁绊了，而且与美国卫星相比，这个能摆脱地球引力羁绊的卫星还是相当大的，这是苏联科学家伊柳辛和连斯基在“消息报”上答读者问时说的。
    他们认为，苏联第三个卫星发射成功在宇宙航行学上的意义可以作如下表述：“苏联头两个人造地球卫星的飞行标志着第一宇宙障碍已被克服。将近一吨半重的第三个卫星发射到离地球极远的轨道上标志着，我们的火箭技术已经可以在任何时刻克服第二宇宙障碍”。
    作者说，克服第一宇宙障碍就是说要能使物体沿圆轨道绕地球运行。为此必须使火箭具有大约每秒八公里的速度（这就是所谓第一宇宙速度）。而摆脱地球引力羁绊（这样，火箭就可以飞到月球上），就必须克服第二宇宙障碍，这就是要使火箭具有每秒十一点二公里的速度（这就是所谓第二宇宙速度）。
    文章说，苏联第三个卫星重一千三百二十七公斤，因此这个卫星可以很容易地换成一个同样重量的火箭。这样，这个火箭在它的发动机开动以前已有每秒约八公里的速度。而当这个火箭的发动机工作结束时，火箭就可以具有比第二宇宙速度还大的速度了。
    作者还指出，像美国人那样，在赤道平面或与赤道平面相接近的平面上沿地球自转方向发射火箭，可以使火箭“无偿地”多得每秒约半公里的速度，从而把火箭送到较远的轨道上。但是这种卫星无论什么时候也到不了离两极较近的地方，也不能到达广大的纬度地区，也就是说，在地球大气层、地磁、太阳辐射和宇宙及大气高层中其它现象方面，都只能提供无论就那一点说都极有限的情报。
