    Foot-powered Rice Huller
    Fast Hulling, High Shelling Rate, Low Cost
    Xu Meixun, deputy director of the Guanyinqiao Grain Station in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, and the Tiemu Industry Cooperative in Chashi Township, recently invented a foot-powered rice huller. After their long-term research and three modifications, it is now a success.
    The foot-powered automatic rice huller is manufactured based on the principle of using a foot-powered axis to drive a flywheel, which drives gears, which drives the pushers. Tests have shown that one person can operate three to six pushers. Calculating based on three pushers, it can hull 480 jin of rice per hour. Working eight hours a day, it can hull more than 3,800 jin of rice, which is five times more than the original hand-pushed huller, which could hull 80 jin per hour. The shelling rate has increased from the original 85% to over 95%.
    The manufacturing method is very simple. Use about 800 jin of wood, two ball bearings, and a small amount of ordinary iron to make three local pushers, each with a surrounding pusher gear. Add a central driving wheel on top, set a gear alignment, install a wooden frame, and use a 4.8 chi iron axle, with a power disk installed on each end. Install two rotating hook axles in the middle of the axle (spaced two to three cun apart), add buttons, install two pedals underneath, and add a horizontal piece of wood on top as a seat. Once you step on it, the power disk moves and drives the central gear. If three pushers are installed on the other side in the same way, 960 jin of rice can be hulled per hour. The cost of manufacturing such a rice huller is also very low, about 72 yuan RMB per unit.
    After this rice huller was successfully trial-produced, it was unanimously praised by the masses. The Hengyang Special District and Hengnan County Grain Bureau held an on-site sideline production meeting in Chashi Township and are preparing to promote it widely in grain stations throughout the county.

### 脚踏推谷机  推谷快  破壳多  造价低

    脚踏推谷机
    推谷快  破壳多  造价低
    湖南衡南县观音桥粮站副主任许美埙和茶市乡铁木业社，最近发明了脚踏推谷机，经过他们长期研究和三次改制，现在已经成功了。
    脚踏自动推谷机是按照脚踏轴心，发动飞轮，牵动齿轮，带动推子的原理而制造的。经过试验，一人能掌握三至六部推子，每小时按三部计算，可推谷四百八十斤，每天做八个小时工作，可推谷三千八百多斤，比原来手推子每小时推谷八十斤提高了五倍，破壳率由原来的85％提高到95％以上。
    制造的方法很简单，用木料八百斤左右，二个走钢珠和小量的普铁，做三个土推子，各加一个围推齿轮，上面加一个中心带动轮，设一个齿轮准心，安装一个木架子，用一个四点八市尺铁轴杆，两端各装一个动力盘，轴心当中装两个转钩轴杆（每个相隔二到三寸），加上扭扣，底下装两个踏板，上面加上一块横木作为坐板，用脚一踏，动力盘一动，带动了中心齿轮就行了；如果这边也同样的装上三个推子，每小时就能推谷九百六十斤。制造这样的推谷机，价钱也很便宜，每台合人民币七十二元。
    这部推谷机试制成功后，受到群众一致赞扬。衡阳专区和衡南县粮食局在茶市乡召开副业生产现场会，即将准备在县内各粮站普遍推行。
