Our Cultural Envoys in Belgium and Luxembourg

    After successfully completing their tour performances in various parts of France, the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe achieved new victories in Belgium and Luxembourg. Their performances in these two countries won great enthusiasm from the general audience, becoming a rare grand event in the artistic life of both nations.

    The Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe arrived in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, on June 10th to participate in the International Drama Festival held there. Their premiere performance at the Brussels Palace of Fine Arts on the evening of the 13th caused a sensation throughout Belgium. That night was unprecedented. Hundreds of celebrities from all walks of life in Belgium and more than a thousand art enthusiasts filled all the seats, expressing enthusiastic welcome to all the programs, with applause often drowning out the loud gongs and drums. The audience's hearty laughter and timely cheers sometimes seemed to understand Chinese dramatic art even better than the French audience. Queen Mother Elisabeth was also invited to watch the play and stayed until late at night to watch all the programs. She was very interested in every program and used many different words of praise to express her appreciation. She said to Wu Han, the head of the delegation, who accompanied her to watch the play: she had never seen such a good and beautiful play. She thanked Chairman Mao for sending such a good art troupe to Belgium. During the intermission, the Queen Mother also met with the actors, talked with them cordially, and congratulated them on their success. Due to the Queen Mother's recommendation, Prince Philippe also came to watch the performance of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe later and praised the programs performed in the same way.

    In order to satisfy the Belgian audience's desire for Chinese drama, the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe also went to Antwerp, Liège, Ostend, Oudenaarde, Charleroi, Mons and other cities to perform, in addition to performing in Brussels. Whether in Brussels or in other cities, almost every performance was full, with thunderous applause. It is particularly worth pointing out that during the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe's stay in Belgium, some reactionary groups in Western Europe attempted to take advantage of the execution of Nagy, the chief culprit of the Hungarian counter-revolution, to stir up trouble and once again set off an anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave. Some anti-communist fanatics in Belgium launched so-called "protest" movements and incited the public to oppose the theatrical performances being held in Belgium by Soviet and Chinese art troupes. But they were wasting their efforts, and the dramas of China and the Soviet Union were still warmly welcomed by the audience. The scene on the night when the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe performed in Oudenaarde was particularly moving. In this small city with a population of less than 10,000, nearly 3,000 citizens came to watch the performance of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe. The program was staged in an open-air sports field. The weather was very bad that night, with wind and rain, and the cold was biting. Our actors insisted on performing, and the audience appreciated Chinese drama and dance in the wind and rain from beginning to end, their enthusiasm dispelling the cold. This situation not only shows the great charm of Chinese dramatic art but also shows the deep friendship between the Chinese and Belgian peoples.

    The Belgian art circles and public opinion gave high praise to the performance of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe. The drama critics of various newspapers unanimously praised the success of the performance. The Brussels "Red Flag" wrote: "The whole performance is extremely charming. Even if we cannot fully appreciate the subtleties of each classical program, we cannot but be fascinated by the colorful and magnificent images before us." Some newspapers praised "Peking Opera" as "the drama of all talents" and "a wonderful art," saying that it "greatly surpasses the level that Western drama has reached so far."

    Some commentators have seen that ancient Chinese traditional art has new vitality today. "Lantern News" wrote in its review of the folk dance performance: "We thought their art was ancient and vigorous, but the flames they wielded, the emotions they expressed—the joyful emotions of the victorious Chinese people—are living reality." Ghislain, an academician of the Belgian Academy of Sciences, especially praised the new spirit of collectivism of our actors in an article published in "Evening News." He wrote: "The members of the Peking Opera troupe are united. ... They have received roughly the same training, and they work and labor together, so they have the noble qualities of mutual unity and trust, and there is also mutual competition, with 'stars' and 'extras' in equal positions...." Even some newspapers with prejudice or hostility towards the new China could not deny that the performance of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe achieved great success.

    In addition to the performances, the Chinese artists also had many friendly contacts with people from all walks of life in Belgium. These exchanges are of great benefit to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Belgian peoples.

    Queen Mother Elisabeth specially invited Wu Han, the head of the delegation, to her palace for lunch. The Queen Mother was very concerned about the rapid development of the new China and expressed infinite admiration for Chairman Mao's wise leadership. She repeatedly asked Wu Han to convey her regards to Chairman Mao.

    When the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe went to various cities to perform, the local mayors personally held receptions to welcome the Chinese artists. Some mayors went backstage to express their congratulations and thanks to the Chinese artists after watching the performances.

    Whether in formal talks or general contacts, people are deeply impressed by how much the Belgian people cherish the friendship with the Chinese people. At a reception, a professor at the University of Brussels said a little excitedly: "Some people unreasonably prevented you from participating in the International Exposition. Their doing so can only greatly detract from the Exposition. They want to prevent the people of Belgium and China from contacting and understanding each other. It is impossible to do so. The warm reception of you by the Belgian people is the best proof."

    The short days of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe in Luxembourg were also equally unforgettable. The mayor of Luxembourg City, the capital of Luxembourg, warmly stated in his welcoming speech to the Chinese artists that he was convinced that the friendship between the people of China and Luxembourg could be enhanced on the basis of mutual trust and mutual respect. He also repeatedly toasted to the friendship between the two countries. The performance of the Chinese Opera and Dance Troupe in Luxembourg was warmly welcomed by the audience. After the performance, Mr. Blum, the chairman of the Luxembourg-China Friendship Association, congratulated our artists and said: "The goal you have pursued through long journeys and hard work—friendship and peace—has been achieved. You can see how warmly the Luxembourg audience welcomes you. They treat you not only as a visitor from afar but also as a close old friend."

    Yes, our cultural envoys came to Belgium and Luxembourg with the friendship of the Chinese people, and they also found sincere friendship among the people of these two countries.

    我国文化使者在比利时和卢森堡
    谭文瑞
    中国戏曲歌舞团胜利地完成了在法国各地的巡回公演的使命之后，又在比利时和卢森堡获得了新的胜利。他们在这两个国家的演出，赢得了广大观众的巨大热情，成为两国艺术生活中罕见的盛事。
    中国戏曲歌舞团在6月10日到达比利时首都布鲁塞尔，参加在那里举行的国际戏剧节。他们13日晚上在布鲁塞尔艺术宫举行的首次演出就轰动了整个比时利。那天晚上是盛况空前。几百位比利时各界的名流和一千多艺术爱好者占满了全部的座位，他们对所有的节目都表示了狂热的欢迎，掌声经常盖过了响亮的锣鼓声。观众们爽朗的笑声和合时的喝采有时候显得比法国的观众更善于理解中国的戏剧艺术。伊丽莎白王太后也应邀前来观剧，而且一直留到深夜把全部节目看完。她对每一个节目都感到极大的兴趣，并用了许多不同的赞美之词来表示她的赞赏。她对陪她看戏的吴晗团长说：她从来没有看过这样好这样美的戏。她感谢毛主席给比利时派来了这样好的艺术团。在休息的时间，王太后并接见了演员们，和他们亲切地交谈，祝贺他们的成功。由于王太后的推荐，菲立浦亲王后来也来观看了中国戏曲歌舞团的演出，对于所演出的节目，也同样地称赞不已。
    为了满足比利时广大观众对于中国戏剧的渴望，中国戏曲歌舞团除了在布鲁塞尔演出之外，还到了安特卫普、列日、奥斯坦德、奥丹纳尔德、沙勒尔瓦、蒙斯等城市去演出。不论在布鲁塞尔也好，或者在其他的城市也好，差不多都是场场满座，掌声如雷。特别值得指出的是，中国戏曲歌舞团在比利时的期间，正值西欧的某些反动集团企图借匈牙利反革命罪魁纳吉被正法的事情兴风作浪，又一次掀起反苏反共的狂潮，比利时的一些反共狂徒曾经发动所谓“抗议”运动，并鼓动公众反对苏联和中国艺术团正在比利时举行的戏剧演出。但是他们是白费气力了，中国和苏联的戏剧照样受到观众的热烈欢迎。中国戏曲歌舞团在奥丹纳尔德演出的那个晚上的情景特别使人感动。在这个人口不到一万的小城市，竟有近三千的市民来观看中国戏曲歌舞团的演出。节目是在一个露天的运动场中上演的，那天晚上天气很不好，刮着风、下着雨，寒气袭人，我们的演员们坚持了演出，而观众也自始至终冒着风雨欣赏中国的戏剧和歌舞，他们的热情驱除了寒意。这种景况不仅表明了中国戏剧艺术具有巨大的魅力，而且也表明了中比两国人民之间存在着深厚的友谊。
    比利时艺术界和舆论界对于中国戏曲歌舞团演出的评价是很高的。各个报纸的戏剧评论家都一致称赞演出的成功。布鲁塞尔的“红旗报”写道：“整个演出极富魅力。即使我们还不能充分体会每个古典节目的纤细入微之处，我们也不能不被眼前五色缤纷、瑰丽无比的形象所迷住了。”有些报纸把“京剧”誉称为“全才的戏剧”，是“美妙绝伦的艺术”，说它“大大超过了西方戏剧迄今达到的水平。”
    有的评论家看出了中国古老的传统艺术今天有了新的活力。“灯笼报”在评论演出的民间舞蹈时写道：“我们以为他们的艺术是古老苍劲的，然而他们舞弄的火焰，他们表达的感情——胜利了的中国人民欢欣鼓舞的感情——却是活生生的现实。”比利时科学院院士吉斯兰在“晚报”上所发表的文章特别赞扬我们演员们集体主义的新精神。他写道：“京剧团的团员们是团结无间的。……他们受过大体一样的训练，大家在一起劳动，一起工作，因此也就有互相团结、信赖的高贵品质，同时也有相互间的竞赛，‘明星’和‘跑龙套的’处于平等的地位……。”甚至有个别对新中国怀有偏见或敌意的报纸，也无法否认中国戏曲歌舞团的演出获得了巨大的成功。
    在演出之外，中国的艺术家们还和比利时各界人士进行了许多友好的接触，这些交往对于增进中比两国人民相互间的了解和友谊有很大的好处。
    伊丽莎白王太后在一个中午特别邀请了吴晗团长到她的宫里去作客，并一同进餐。王太后对新中国飞跃发展的情况十分关怀，并对毛主席的英明领导表示无限敬佩，她再三嘱托吴晗团长代向毛主席致意。
    当中国戏曲歌舞团到各个城市演出的时候，当地的市长都亲自举行了招待会来欢迎中国艺术家，有些地方的市长在观看了演出之后还到后台来向中国艺术家们表示祝贺和感谢。
    不论是在正式的座谈或者一般的接触中，都使人深深感到比利时人民是如何珍视和中国人民之间的友谊。在一个招待会上，一位布鲁塞尔大学的教授有点激动地说：“有人无理地阻止你们参加国际博览会，他们这样做只能使博览会大为减色，他们想阻止比中两国人民相互接触和了解是办不到的，比利时人民对你们的热情接待就是最好的证明。”
    中国戏曲歌舞团在卢森堡的短促的日子，也是同样令人难忘的。卢森堡首都卢森堡市的市长在他为中国艺术家举行的欢迎会上热情地致词说，他深信在相互信任和相互尊重的基础上，中卢两国人民之间的友谊一定能够获得增进。他并且一再为两国的友谊干杯。中国戏曲歌舞团在卢森堡的演出，受到观众的热烈欢迎，在演出结束后，卢中友好协会主席布鲁姆先生向我们的艺术家们祝贺说：“你们长途跋涉和辛勤劳动所追求的目的——友谊和和平，是达到了。你们可以看得见，卢森堡的观众是如何热情地欢迎你们，他们不仅是把你们看作是一个远方来客，而且是把你们看作是一个亲密的老朋友来接待的。”
    是的，我们的文化使者带着中国人民的友谊来到了比利时和卢森堡，而他们在这两个国家的人民中间也找到了真挚的友谊。
