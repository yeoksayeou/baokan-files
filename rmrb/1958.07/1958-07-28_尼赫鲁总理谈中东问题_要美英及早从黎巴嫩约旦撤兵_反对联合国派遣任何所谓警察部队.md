Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 27th – According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated today that he hopes foreign troops will withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible.

At a press conference held in New Delhi, Nehru said that for various reasons, he was unwilling to elaborate on the Middle East issue. He said: "However, generally speaking, everyone knows our views. We believe that foreign troops staying in any country will not be of any benefit."

Nehru said that as far as Iraq is concerned, every piece of news indicates the fact that the current Iraqi regime is very consolidated, very stable, and very popular.

Nehru said: "It is said that one of the main reasons why certain Western countries are interested in the Middle East is oil, but no matter what happens, there seems to be no obvious reason to suggest that they have any difficulties in obtaining oil. The current Iraqi government has said this, and so have the governments of other countries."

Nehru mentioned the issue of sending a UN police force to Lebanon and Jordan, saying: "I do not approve of the UN sending any so-called police force." He said that he could not predict the future, but in the current situation, "such a police force would not only fail to help, but might itself become a cause of disputes." He added: "Obviously, troops should not be sent there against the will of a country."

    尼赫鲁总理谈中东问题
    要美英及早从黎巴嫩约旦撤兵
    反对联合国派遣任何所谓警察部队
    新华社新德里27日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁今天表示希望外国军队及早撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    尼赫鲁在新德里举行的记者招待会上说，由于各种原因，他不愿意详谈中东问题。他说：“但是，一般说来，人人都知道我们的看法。我们认为，外国军队呆在任何国家内都不会有什么好处”。
    尼赫鲁说，就伊拉克而言，每一条消息都表明了这一事实：伊拉克现在的政权很巩固，很稳定，也很得人心。
    尼赫鲁说：“据说，某些西方国家对中东感兴趣的主要原因之一是石油，但是，无论发生什么事情，似乎都没有什么明显的理由可以说明它们在取得石油方面有任何困难。伊拉克现政府已经这样说过，其他国家的政府也这样说过。”
    尼赫鲁提到了关于派遣联合国警察部队到黎巴嫩和约旦去的问题，他说：“我不赞成联合国派遣任何所谓警察部队。”他说，他不能预言将来的事，但是在目前的情况下，“这样的警察部队非但不能有所帮助，而且它本身可能成为引起争端的原因。”他又说：“显然，不应该违反一个国家的意志而把军队派到那里去。”
