According to the Hebei Daily: From July 10th to 13th, Baoding Prefecture experienced continuous rainfall, and various water conservancy projects were initially tested, playing a significant role in flood control and water storage. Preliminary statistics show that the entire area has stored 75 million cubic meters of water, preventing and reducing flood and waterlogging disasters.

The counties of Laiyuan, Yi County, and Laishui in the district experienced the heaviest rainfall, all exceeding 200 millimeters; other counties all received around 100 millimeters. Although the rainfall was heavy and intense, thanks to the tireless efforts of millions of laborers throughout the winter and spring in constructing various water conservancy projects, the vast majority of floodwaters were intercepted and stored. After being tested by this heavy rain, the 32 medium-sized reservoirs, 1,946 small reservoirs, 692 plain crop reservoirs, and 25 tributaries that had been completely harnessed throughout the area all demonstrated their power in this continuous rainfall. Although the 25 harnessed small rivers encountered varying amounts of rainfall, the floodwaters did not overflow. Although the four major rivers, the Shahe, Tanghe, Zhongyishui, and Juma, have not been completely harnessed, the floodwaters were also significantly reduced.

Storing water everywhere, every reservoir blocking floods, taking storage as primary, storing for use, and dispatching floodwaters to benefit the people—this is a strategic shift in Baoding Prefecture's flood control efforts this year.

    处处蓄水　库库拦洪　以蓄为主　蓄而为用
    保定专区让洪水为人造福
    据河北日报讯　7月10日到13日保定专区连续降雨，各项水利工程初经考验，发挥了显著的拦洪蓄水作用。据初步统计，全区已蓄水七千五百万公方，杜绝和减少了洪沥灾害。
    该区涞源、易县、涞水等县降雨较大，都在二百公厘以上；其他各县均在一百公厘左右。虽然降雨猛、雨量大，但由于全区数百万劳动人民经过一冬一春的鏖战，修作了各项水利建设工程，绝大部分洪水被拦蓄起来。经过这次大雨的考验，全区已修的三十二处中型水库、一千九百四十六座小型水库、六百九十二座平原作物水库和已经根治的二十五条支流小河，在这次连续降雨的情况下，都发挥了威力。已经根治的二十五条小河，虽遇到不同雨量，但洪水均未出川。沙河、唐河、中易水、拒马等四条大河，虽未完成根治，但洪水也显著减少。
    处处蓄水，库库拦洪，以蓄为主，蓄而为用，调度洪水，为人造福，这是保定专区今年在防汛斗争中一个战略性的转变。
