    A million soldiers curbing the raging waves,
    A five-year project completed in five months.
    From now on, along the road by the Ming Tombs,
    Four mountains embrace water, water embraces mountains.

    A dam stands athwart, locking up the flood dragon,
    A hundred-foot-high dam, magnificent in its momentum.
    The west wind is already seen being overthrown,
    The east wind will be praised by generations to come.

    A thousand layers of stone steps lead deep into the valley,
    Transforming the yellow earth into gold is the goal.
    The Wenyu River cherishes its homeland,
    The mountains along the banks are already planted with trees.

    Ten thousand fruit trees planted all around,
    Thousands of stones of fish fry stocked in the deep pools.
    The scenery of Jiangnan is right before our eyes,
    A fragrant pavilion like on Hainan Island is tied to a fishing boat.

    Water stopped, electricity comes immediately,
    A night of stars falling across the nine heavens.
    Conquering nature for our use,
    One ring opened, ten thousand rings will follow.

    Today, double happiness arrives at the door,
    The reservoir is completed on the auspicious day of July 1st.
    Presenting a gift in time, a sea of people,
    Thousands of cheers shake the universe.

    Ten thousand horses gallop like thunder,
    All living things are reborn, shedding their old selves.
    It's not just about preserving water and soil,
    But also about cultivating talent through building the reservoir.

    There are plenty of science, technology, and cultural workers,
    Refined in the crucible, they emerge with golden bodies.
    Spiritual production will surpass the past,
    Creation will be new every day.

    雄师百万挽狂澜
    ——“七一”参加十三陵水库落成典礼书怀
    郭沫若
      （一）
    雄师百万挽狂澜，
    五载工程五月完。
    从此十三陵畔路，
    四山环水水环山。
      （二）
    横流壁立锁蛟龙，
    百丈高堤气势雄。
    已见西风今压倒，
    人间万代颂东风。
      （三）
    磴道千层入谷深，
    要将黄壤变黄金。
    温榆河水怀乡土，
    岸上山山已植林。
      （四）
    果树万株种满缠，
    鱼苗千石殖深渊。
    江南风物眼前是，
    琼岛芳亭系钓船。
      （五）
    水停立使电光来，
    一夜群星落九垓。
    征服自然为我用，
    一环开定万环开。
      （六）
    只今双喜大临门，
    七一佳期水库存。
    献礼及时人山海，
    千声万岁震乾坤。
      （七）
    奔腾万马走惊雷，
    换骨群生已脱胎。
    岂止保持唯水土，
    还从建库建人才。
      （八）
    科技文工大有人，
    洪炉炼罢换金身。
    精神生产将逾昔，
    创造终当日日新。
