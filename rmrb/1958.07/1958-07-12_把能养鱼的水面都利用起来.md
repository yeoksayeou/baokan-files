Utilize All Water Surfaces Suitable for Fish Farming

This year, the freshwater stocking area is expected to reach 30 million mu, doubling last year's figure and increasing more than fivefold compared to 1952. The variety of stocked species has increased compared to the past, and the quality of stocking has also improved. Currently, various regions are adopting all possible measures to strive for a total freshwater fish production increase of more than double that of last year, reaching 2.5 million tons, with farmed fish production exceeding more than triple that of last year, reaching approximately 2 million tons.

Since the state put forward the policy of relying on the masses and focusing on aquaculture for aquatic production this spring, the mass freshwater fish farming endeavor has been widely launched. The water surface area for stocking in various regions has increased severalfold or even dozens of times. Some areas are making every effort to utilize all water surfaces that can be used for fish farming—rivers, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, etc. Hubei Province's stocking area plan for this year has increased dramatically from 2.7 million mu last year to 8 million mu. The leading organs of Anxin County, Hebei Province, called on farmers to be bold in innovation and work hard for 30 days to completely eliminate white spot pits, and have already stocked more than 16,000 mu, expanding 44 times compared to last year, and are continuing to expand the stocking water surface. This year, many regions have also developed from small-area fish farming to large-area stocking. Various regions are generally carrying out large-scale joint stocking organized by townships, uniting several agricultural cooperatives. Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, organized a joint stocking of 300,000 mu in the entire county.

This year, after the masses in various regions broke away from the conservative thinking of reaching the production ceiling, production targets have been leaping forward again and again. To date, 48 counties and cities, including Wuxi, Nanchang, and Qinyang, have proposed to become 1,000-jin fish counties and cities (i.e., 1,000 jin per mu of pond fish). Anxin County, Hebei Province, has proposed to become a double 1,000-jin county.

Freshwater fish farming is an undertaking that requires little investment, yields quick results, and generates substantial benefits, and its development prospects are very promising. It is estimated that the current freshwater fishable water surface area in China reaches 100 million mu. If 80 million mu of water surface are used for fish farming, calculated at an average yield of 400 jin of fish per mu, a total of 16 million tons of fish can be produced annually. Therefore, the Ministry of Aquatic Products is vigorously promoting the freshwater aquaculture business, striving to basically utilize all fishable water surfaces by 1962.

### 把能养鱼的水面都利用起来

    把能养鱼的水面都利用起来
    今年淡水放养面积可达三千万亩，比去年翻一番，比1952年增加五倍多。放养品种比过去增多，放养质量也有所提高。目前各地正采取一切办法，力争淡水鱼总产量比去年增加一倍以上，达到二百五十万吨，其中养鱼产量超过去年的三倍多，达到二百万吨左右。
    今春国家提出了依靠群众，以养殖为主的水产生产方针后，群众性的淡水养鱼事业就广泛地开展起来。各地放养水面几倍、几十倍地增加，有些地区将一切可以养鱼的水面——河荡、湖泊、池塘、水库等尽量利用起来。湖北省今年的放养面积计划由去年的二百七十万亩突增到八百万亩；河北省安新县领导机关号召农民大胆创造，鏖战三十天，全部消灭白点坑，已放养了一万六千余亩，比去年扩大了四十四倍，目前还在继续开拓放养水面。今年许多地区还从小面积养鱼发展到大面积放养。各地普遍地开展以乡为单位组织几个农业社的联合大放养。江苏金坛县组织了全县三十万亩的联合放养。
    今年各地群众打破了生产到顶的保守思想后，生产指标一再跃进。到目前全国已有无锡、南昌、沁阳等四十八个县市提出要成为产鱼千斤县、市（即塘鱼亩产一千斤），河北省安新县提出要成为双千斤县。
    淡水养鱼是一项投资少、收效快、收益大的事业，它的发展前途很大。据估算，目前我国淡水可养水面达一亿亩。如利用八千万亩水面养鱼，按每亩平均产鱼四百斤计算，每年共可产鱼一千六百万吨，因此，水产部正在大力推广淡水养殖事业，争取1962年基本利用全部可养水面。
