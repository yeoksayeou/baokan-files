Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Reporter Wei Wenhua reports: Beijing Normal University, under the command of politics and with the masses mobilized, has adopted a three-way combination of Party committee, experts, and students to carry out a major teaching reform. The first battle has achieved a major victory.

The teaching reform movement at Beijing Normal University began in late June. All ten departments of the university are actively led by the Party Committee and sixty-six branches of the ten general branches. Changing the past practice of a few people monopolizing the revision of syllabuses and the writing of lecture notes under the expert line, the university has boldly mobilized all young and old teachers and more than four thousand students to work together on this task. The senior students of the ten departments have formed a total of two hundred and fifty-six teaching reform groups, who have visited factories, rural areas, and schools, and entered scientific research institutions, libraries, and reference rooms, becoming a vanguard in teaching reform. The teaching syllabuses jointly compiled by students and teachers of the whole university amount to forty-seven, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of courses in the university.

This teaching reform is a profound socialist revolution, and the struggle between two roads and two methods is very fierce. One method is for the Party to lead the broad masses to adopt revolutionary methods, that is, to break out of the original framework, break through the shackles of tradition, and thoroughly reform in accordance with the socialist education policy, boldly affirming the positive and useful aspects of the original things, while boldly negating the negative, useless, and even reactionary things. This is the method supported by everyone. The other method is that some teachers, especially older teachers, still stand within the original framework, hesitating, wriggling, and patching up piecemeal, without making essential changes, which has aroused dissatisfaction among many people. In this way, a scene of enthusiastic contention appeared in the school. Some students adopted the form of "fighting on the stage" to prepare outlines separately with the teachers on the same topic, and then discuss them together, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and jointly compile a new teaching syllabus; some adopted the form of "singing opposite plays," with students and teachers each formulating one or several syllabuses for the same course, and then presenting them for evaluation, debate, and selection of the better one as a basis for joint revision and finalization. According to incomplete statistics, among the one hundred and twenty-seven courses in the university, students have independently proposed one hundred and sixty-nine teaching syllabuses and forty-seven teaching plans after collective research. These syllabuses and plans have a clear socialist stand and are permeated with the idea of serving politics and combining education with productive labor, which has a major promoting effect on the teaching reform of the whole university, and some have been discussed, absorbed the opinions of teachers, revised, and used as formal syllabuses.

In this struggle, at the beginning, most of the teachers were still limited to copying and excerpting from books, while young teachers and students not only wanted to find materials in books, but also paid more attention to practical materials, and went to factories, rural areas, and schools in batches to contact the masses. The focus of the struggle was whether teaching should serve politics and current production. After reading the teaching syllabus written by the teachers, the students of the Electrical Engineering Group of the Physics Department felt that it was empty and could not put forward any opinions for a while. Under the instructions of the Party, they went to factories to find workers, not only finding out the reasons why the past teaching was divorced from reality, but also proposing new content for the electrical engineering course and a plan for establishing a factory. The students of the Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group of the Chinese Department collected a large amount of folk songs and folk literature materials from past dynasties, analyzed and studied them from the Marxist standpoint and viewpoint, and launched nine debates with the teachers, finally overthrowing the old teaching syllabus that regarded the literature of the exploiting class as orthodox and establishing a new syllabus that regarded people's literature as orthodox. The Modern Literature Teaching and Research Group also changed the phenomenon of valuing the past and despising the present through debate and collective research of materials. Other departments such as Geography, History, Education, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Russian have greatly improved their teaching syllabuses after debates. After mobilizing the masses and carrying out debates, the teaching reform work of the whole university proceeded quickly and well. The reform of the teaching syllabuses of a total of one hundred and twenty-seven courses was basically completed in about a month, and the content of each course has been completely renewed.

The Party Committee mobilized the masses to carry out teaching reform, adopted the policy of unity-criticism-unity towards the old teachers, debated in a gentle and realistic manner, criticized the capitalist ideology in teaching, and greatly established socialist ideology. For every problem, a large number of facts were collected, and extensive and in-depth discussions were carried out. According to the opinions of the masses, what should be negated was resolutely and boldly negated, what should be affirmed was affirmed, and what was doubtful was generally retained for continued verification with facts, so as to combine bold creation with seeking truth from facts, neither wholesale negation nor indiscriminate distinction. Many teachers have further recognized themselves and urgently demanded transformation from this movement. Some teachers in the Education Department automatically proposed to link up with a primary school to strengthen their understanding of practical work after the movement. Some old teachers in the science department, seeing the effectiveness of young teachers and students going deep into reality in factories, no longer relied solely on books, but looked for opportunities to go to factories. The debate in the Chinese Department was the most acute. The teachers generally believed that this was a very profound socialist education, and expressed their willingness to accelerate ideological transformation, and under the leadership of the Party, work together with the students to write good lectures and teach courses well.

    跳出原有的框框　冲破传统的束缚
    大破大立  新代陈谢
    北京师范大学实行党委、专家、学生三结合制定新的教学大纲
    据新华社16日讯　记者魏文华报道：北京师范大学政治挂帅，群众动手，采取党委、专家、学生三结合的办法，进行教学大改革。第一仗取得重大胜利。
    北京师范大学的教学改革运动是在6月下旬开始的。全校十个系由党委会和十个总支六十六个支部挂帅，积极领导这一运动。改变过去修订大纲、编写讲稿由少数人包办的专家路线，放手发动全校所有的青年老年教师和四千多学生，大家共同搞这一工作。全校十个系的高年级学生共成立二百五十六个教学改革小组，他们到工厂、农村、学校访问，出入于科学研究机关、图书馆、资料室等，成为教学改革中的一支尖兵。全校学生和教师合编的教学大纲有四十七份，占全校课程总数三分之一以上。
    这一次教学改革，是一场深刻的社会主义革命，两条道路、两种方法的斗争是十分剧烈的。一种办法是党领导广大群众采取革命的办法，即跳出原有的框框，冲破传统的束缚，按照社会主义教育方针大刀阔斧彻底地改，既要从原有的东西中肯定积极有用的，又要大胆否定消极无用以至反动的东西，这是大家所拥护的办法；另外一种办法，就是还有部分教师特别是老年教师，他们仍站在原有的框子里，瞻前顾后，扭扭捏捏，枝枝节节地修修补补，不作本质上的改变，引起许多人的不满。这样，学校就出现了热烈争鸣的场面，有的学生采取“打擂台”的形式，和教师就同一个课题分头准备提纲，然后在一起讨论，相互取长补短，共同编制一份新的教学大纲；有的采取“唱对台戏”的形式，同一课程由学生和教师各自制定一个或几个大纲，然后两方面摆出来，进行评比，开展辩论，选出其中较好的一个做基础共同修改定案。据不完全的统计，全校一百二十七门课程当中，学生集体研究后独立提出的教学大纲计有一百六十九份，教学计划四十七份。这些大纲和计划都具有鲜明的社会主义立场，贯穿着为政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的思想，这对全校教学改革具有重大推动和促进作用，有的并已经过讨论吸收教师意见修改后作为正式的大纲了。
    在这场斗争中，开始时教师们多数还只限于书本上抄抄摘摘，而青年教师和学生则既要在书本上找资料，更重视实际的资料，一批一批地到工厂、农村、学校中去和群众接触。斗争的焦点是教学要不要为政治为当前生产服务。物理系电工组的学生看了教师写的教学大纲觉得空，一时提不出意见，他们就在党的指示下去工厂找工人，不但找出过去教学脱离实际的原因，而且提出电工课新内容和建立工厂的方案。中文系古典文学教研组的学生收集了历代大量的民歌和民间文学资料，用马克思主义的立场观点分析研究，和教师展开九次论辩，终于推倒以剥削阶级文学为正宗的旧教学大纲，建立了以人民文学为正宗的新大纲。现代文学教研组也经过辩论，集体找资料，改变厚古薄今的现象。其它地理、历史、教育、化学、生物、数学、俄语等系，都是经过辩论后，把教学大纲大大提高了一步。全校经过发动群众，开展辩论，教学改革工作进行得又快又好，总共一百二十七门课的教学大纲改革工作，在一个月左右的时间内基本上完成了，而且各门课内容都面目一新。
    党委发动群众进行教学改革，对老教师采取团结——批评——团结的政策，和风细雨实事求是地辩论，批判教学中的资本主义思想，大立社会主义思想。对每一个问题都收集大量的事实，通过广泛深入地开展讨论，根据群众意见，对应该否定的坚决大胆地否定，对应该肯定的予以肯定，有疑问的一般保留下来继续用事实来检验，做到大胆创造和实事求是相结合，既非全盘否定，也非皂白不分。许多教师从这次运动中进一步认识了自己，迫切要求改造，进步。教育系有的教师经过运动，自动提出准备和一个小学挂钩，加强对实际工作的了解。理科有的老教师看到青年教师和学生到工厂深入实际的成效，也不再单纯依赖书本，而找机会下厂了。中文系的辩论是最尖锐的，教师们普遍认为这是一次非常深刻的社会主义教育，表示要加速思想改造，在党的领导下，和学生一起共同把讲义写好，教好课程。（附图片）
