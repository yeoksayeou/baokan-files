　　Former Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy spoke at a public rally in Karachi on the evening of the 22nd, openly defending imperialist military treaties and attacking United Arab Republic President Nasser and Arab nationalism. Instead of applause, he received shoes and stones flying from the audience and angry shouts of "Down with the imperialist agent!" Suhrawardy had to seek the protection of the police, hastily ended his speech, and left the venue.

　　This news shows which way the wind is blowing and where the hearts of the people lie. Pakistan is no exception. Many political leaders and almost all newspapers in Pakistan, like those in other parts of the world, condemn the Anglo-American aggression against the Middle East, but Suhrawardy wants to defend the Anglo-American aggressors; Pakistani public opinion demands that the government not participate in any adventurous activities launched in the name of the Baghdad Pact and not "gamble with Pakistan's fate," but Suhrawardy praises military treaties, saying that military alliances make "Pakistan very strong"; the Pakistani people sympathize with and support the Arab people's movement to strive for and defend national independence, demanding that the government immediately recognize the Republic of Iraq, but Suhrawardy believes that the Iraqi revolution is a "terrible tragedy" and fiercely attacks Arab nationalism. Such opposition to the wishes of the people can be regarded as utter ignorance of the times.

　　Opposition to the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism has become the most powerful people's movement of our time; anyone who goes against the will of the people and blindly follows Anglo-American imperialism will never have a good end.

    人心向背
    巴基斯坦前总理苏拉瓦底22日晚上在卡拉奇的一次公众集会上讲话，公开为帝国主义的军事条约辩护，并且攻击阿联总统纳赛尔和阿拉伯民族主义。他得到的不是掌声，而是从听众中不断飞来的鞋子和石块以及“打倒帝国主义代理人”的愤怒喊声。苏拉瓦底不得不求救于警察的保护，匆匆结束他的讲演，离开了会场。
    这条消息表明了人心的向背，世界的风向变了。巴基斯坦也不例外。巴基斯坦的很多政党领袖和几乎所有的报纸，同世界其它地方一样，都谴责美英对中东的侵略，而苏拉瓦底却要为美英侵略者辩护；巴基斯坦的舆论要求政府不要参加以巴格达条约名义发动的任何冒险活动，不要拿“巴基斯坦的命运去作赌注”，而苏拉瓦底却歌颂军事条约，说什么军事联盟使得“巴基斯坦非常强大”；巴基斯坦人民同情并支持阿拉伯人民争取和保卫民族独立的运动，要求政府立即承认伊拉克共和国，而苏拉瓦底却认为伊拉克的革命是“可怕的悲剧”，大肆攻击阿拉伯民族主义；如此同人民的愿望作对，真可以算是透顶的不识时务了。
    反对美英帝国主义的侵略，已成为当代最强大的人民的运动；谁要是违背人民的意志，一味跟着美英帝国主义跑，绝不会有什么好下场。
