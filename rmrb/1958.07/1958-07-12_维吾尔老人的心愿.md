A Uyghur Elder's Wish
    Oulin Li Hun

    Every morning, Elder Aishan quietly left home on his little donkey with his grandson. They didn't return until dusk. Aishan's son, Kerimu, the director of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative, had asked his father and son countless times, but he couldn't get to the bottom of it. One day, he decided to skip work in the fields for a morning and secretly followed his father, finally solving the mystery.

    Early in the spring, big news spread across Xinjiang: the Lanxin Railway was about to enter Xinjiang and would be open to traffic in Hami this autumn. Elder Aishan was so happy when he heard this that he couldn't sleep all night. The next day, he rode his little donkey to the railway construction site with his grandson. The engineering team led Elder Aishan around. As Aishan walked, he thought: These young people left their parents and hometowns, traveling thousands of miles to our Hami County, not for money or possessions, but wholeheartedly for the five million people of Xinjiang. They are truly good children of Chairman Mao. What should we Xinjiang people do to welcome these road builders? This Gobi Desert is not easy to deal with! In the summer, it's like an oven for baking nang (a type of bread favored by Uyghurs), with nowhere to find shade. If they could eat our sweet and fragrant Hami melons, that would be... The old man made up his mind and hurried home. He grabbed his son:

    "Kerimu, I'm telling you, have you thought about planting some melons for them?"

    "For who?"

    "For the young men building the road."

    Kerimu smiled broadly: "Ha, the cooperative management committee discussed it long ago and decided to expand the melon fields by twenty mu."

    "Good, count me in."

    "You?" Kerimu was surprised. "Dad, you're seventy-two this year!"

    "What? What?" As he spoke, the old man was about to twist his son's wrist. "Does an eagle get old?"

    "...It doesn't matter who plants them, as long as we can get the melons to them in the fall!" Kerimu retreated, trying to persuade him nicely. "Besides, people have already been assigned, can we change that?" Kerimu told a lie.

    The old man glared at his son, knowing that further requests would be useless. There was only one reason: his father was old.

    Aishan angrily left his son, and he began to look for those old partners who used to chat under the trees, play "Kurdi" (poker), or spread out their quilted robes for a nap. They were all robust old men, like old oak trees, and they were all spending their later years in "unease." Aishan's proposal was warmly welcomed. They rode their little donkeys, carrying ketuomans (hoes), and set off. After several days of surveying and discussion, they decided on a piece of near-water wasteland four miles from the village as the melon field, and later they pooled their melon seeds. Thus, a new melon patch was born, unknown to the director of the agricultural cooperative. The old men left early and returned late every day, arousing much suspicion, but they kept their promise: telling no one.

    Now, Kerimu followed them all the way to the melon field, learning the secret, and he was so moved that he couldn't say anything. Looking at these vigorous old men, they seemed younger than before. Seeing the lush green melon vines, scenes of the road builders relishing the melons appeared before his eyes...

    维吾尔老人的心愿
    欧琳　李魂
    艾山老汉每天清早骑上小毛驴，和他的小孙子不声不响地离开家。直到傍晚，他们才回来。艾山老汉的儿子、前进农业社的主任克里木，曾经问过父亲和儿子多少次，总问不出个究竟。这一天，他豁出一上午不下地，悄悄尾随着父亲，才解破了这个谜。
    刚开春，新疆传开了一件大事情，兰新铁路马上要进新疆了，今年秋天就通车到哈密。艾山老汉听到这事乐得一夜没閤眼。第二天他就和小孙儿骑上毛驴到铁路工地上去了。工程队的人领着艾山老汉走了一圈。艾山一面走着，一面想：这些年轻的孩子们，离开爹妈，离开家乡，千里迢迢来到咱哈密县，既不为金，又不为银，一心为了咱新疆五百万人民，真是毛主席的好孩子。咱新疆人该用什么来迎接这些筑路工人呢？这戈壁滩可不是好惹的啊！一到夏天就像烤馕（维族人民爱吃的一种面饼）的火炉子，连个遮荫的地方都没处找。要是能吃上咱哈密又甜又香的瓜果，那可……。老汉拿定了主意，急急忙忙赶回家。他拉住自己的儿子：
    “我说克里木，你这个社主任想到没有，该给他们种些瓜啊！”
    “谁？”
    “修路的小伙子们。”
    克里木眉开眼笑地：“咳，社管会早讨论啦，扩种二十亩瓜田。”
    “那好，算我一个。”
    “你？”克里木惊奇了。“爸爸，今年你七十二啦！”
    “怎么？怎么？”说着老汉就要动手掰儿子的手腕。“山鹰还能老吗？”
    “……不管谁种的，秋天能把瓜送到他们手里不就行啦！”克里木往后退着，好言好语地劝道。“再说，人都派定啦，还能换？”克里木撒了个谎。
    老汉狠狠瞪了儿子一眼，他知道再求也没用。原因只有一个：爸爸老了。
    艾山生气地离开儿子，他开始去找那些一起在树荫下聊天，打“库尔的”（朴克牌），或是铺开夹袷袢（大衣）睡觉的老伙伴。他们都是像老橡树一样壮实的老汉，而且也都是在“不安心”地度着晚年的人。艾山的提议受到热烈欢迎。他们骑上小毛驴，带上砍土曼（铁锹）出发了。经过几天的勘测、讨论，确定了离村七里路的一块近水的荒地作为瓜田，后来又分别凑足了瓜种。于是，一块农业社主任不知道的新瓜园诞生了。老汉们每天早出晚归，虽然引起许多人怀疑，但他们信守着自己的诺言：谁也不告诉。
    现在，克里木一直跟踪到瓜田里，了解到这个秘密，他感动得什么也说不出。看到这些精神矍铄的老人，他们像是比以前年青了。看到绿油油的瓜秧，眼前仿佛映现出了筑路工人们津津有味的吃着瓜的情景。……
