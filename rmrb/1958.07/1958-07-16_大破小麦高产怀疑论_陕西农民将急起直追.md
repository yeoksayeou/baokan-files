Thoroughly Smash the Doubts About High Wheat Yields
Shaanxi Farmers Will Catch Up Quickly

    (Our report) Our correspondents Liu Bin and Han Guoying report: After Shaanxi Province launched a large-scale debate to break down the doubts about high wheat yields, farmers' confidence has greatly increased, and their enthusiasm is soaring as they actively prepare to launch high-yield satellites.

    The Guanzhong Plain has always been a high-yield wheat area in our country, and farmers have rich experience in wheat cultivation. This year, the miracle of high wheat yields in Henan, Hubei and other provinces has greatly shocked the farmers in the Guanzhong area. Many people believe that they should overcome the idea of ​​considering themselves advanced and catch up quickly. However, some people also have doubts. Some people said that they probably wanted to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, and deliberately overstated the wheat yield, with one wanting to outdo the other. Some people shook their heads when they heard the news of higher and higher yields, saying, "This is like 'the wind blowing the grinding stone - pure bragging!'" They probably couldn't even weigh that many wheat stalks! How could anyone have seen a mu of wheat yielding 5,000 jin in all these generations? Some people also said that their wheat-growing experience was learned from Shaanxi, and the wheat varieties were also taken from Shaanxi in pots and jars. We also use these methods and Bima No. 1, and we've strained our eyes to achieve high yields, but we haven't even harvested 2,000 jin yet. How can they harvest 5,000 jin? Some agricultural scientists also did not believe this.

    In order to break down the doubts, Shaanxi Province launched a large-scale debate in the Qinchuan area, targeting this kind of thinking. Chang'an, Wugong and Xi'an and other counties and cities organized agricultural cooperative members to visit Hubei and Henan provinces. The relevant departments of Shaanxi Province also invited members of agricultural cooperatives in Hubei and Henan who created high wheat yields to introduce their experiences to representatives of agricultural cooperatives from more than 60 counties and cities in the province, bringing their wheat with them. In the debate, many agricultural cooperatives, after specifically calculating the accounts and comparing the measures taken by farmers in Hubei and Henan to increase wheat production with their own, most farmers were convinced that if they really implemented those measures taken in production, they could completely harvest that much wheat. The common laws of some agricultural cooperatives in Hubei and Henan for creating high wheat yields are deep plowing, large amounts of fertilizer, and a large number of densely planted plants. The shortcoming of Shaanxi farmers in not being able to leap forward in wheat production lies precisely here. People have already densely planted 1.2 million to 2.4 million plants, and the degree of deep plowing has reached 1.5 to 2 chi, and the amount of fertilizer has reached 100,000 to 200,000 jin; while in Shaanxi Province, the general degree of deep plowing is only 4 to 5 cun deep, fertilization is 5,000 to 6,000 jin, and dense planting is more than 300,000 plants, and even in high-yield areas it is only 500,000 to 600,000 plants. Farmers generally believe that farming like Henan and Hubei is also possible in Guanzhong. The problem is that they have conservative ideas and have not dared to think or act that way in the past.

    Isn't it true that there has never been a yield of several thousand jin per mu from generation to generation? Even on this point, the skeptics could not stand their ground. When organizing the great debate, the Northwest Agricultural College and the Chang'an County People's Committee looked through many ancient Chinese agricultural works on the spot. According to Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture" of the Yuan Dynasty, at that time, district planting was used, with each district harvesting one dou of grain and each mu harvesting 66 shi, and a high-yield record of 16 shi of soybeans. The agricultural works of the Han Dynasty agronomist Fan Shengzhi, "The Book of Fan Shengzhi," record that in the Han Dynasty, in the middle reaches of the Yellow River in northern China, district planting of wheat was also used on ten mu, with each mu yielding one hundred shi, which translates to an average of 5,600 jin per mu today. Farmers were very interested in this. They said that what predecessors could not do, we can also do, not to mention that predecessors have already done it. The current production conditions are hundreds of times better than in feudal society. Why can't we create more high-yield records? This great debate laid a good ideological foundation for striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production. Many people who used to be slow and hesitant have also become active. According to incomplete statistics from 60 counties and cities, more than 1,000 agricultural cooperatives have formulated plans to launch artificial satellites in various crops.

    The skeptical thinking of agricultural scientists has also been dispelled. After listening to the introduction of high-yield experience of farmers in Hubei and Henan, professors at the Northwest Agricultural College admitted that many of their measures were indeed very scientific. They said that Bima No. 1 was bred by them, but they did not receive 2,000 jin, while farmers in Hubei and Henan can produce 5,000 jin, which is "the student surpassing the teacher." They requested that these representatives send back some of the local Bima No. 1 seeds for their experimental research. Northwest Agricultural College also signed a liaison contract with representatives of agricultural cooperatives from Henan Province, and sent lecturers to study at the Shuanglou Agricultural Cooperative in Henan.

### 大破小麦高产怀疑论  陕西农民将急起直追

    大破小麦高产怀疑论
    陕西农民将急起直追
    本报讯　记者刘斌、韩国英报道：陕西省开展大辩论打破对小麦高额丰产的怀疑论后，农民信心倍增，干劲冲天，积极准备放丰产卫星。
    关中平原历来是我国小麦高产区，农民植麦经验丰富。今年河南、湖北等省小麦高额丰产的奇迹陆续出现对关中地区农民震动很大，许多人认为应克服以先进自居的思想，急起直追。但是，也有一部分人抱怀疑态度。有些人说，他们大概是想进北京见毛主席了，故意把小麦产量说得高一些，一个想把一个压下去。有的人听见高额丰产一个赛一个的消息直摇头，说，这是“风扬碌碡——胡吹哩！”管保他们连麦秆也称不下那样多！老少多少辈谁见过一亩麦子能打五千斤？还有人讲，他们的种麦经验是从陕西学去的，小麦品种也是从陕西用盆盆罐罐拿去的，我们也用的是这些方法和碧蚂一号，为了搞高产把眼都敖红了，连两千斤都还没有收到，他们就能打五千斤？有一部分农业科学人员对这件事也不相信。
    为了打破怀疑论，陕西省在八百里秦川针对这种思想情况展开了大辩论。长安、武功和西安等县、市组织农业社员到湖北、河南省进行参观。陕西省有关部门还请湖北、河南创造小麦高额丰产的农业社的社员带着他们的麦子前来给全省六十多个县、市的农业社代表介绍经验。有许多农业社在辩论中经过具体算账，拿湖北、河南农民增产小麦的措施和自己的对比，绝大部分农民都服气了，认为真要是贯彻了人家在生产中所采取的那些措施，完全可以打那样多小麦。湖北、河南有些农业社创造小麦高额丰产的共同规律是耕的深、施肥量大、密植的株数多。陕西农民在小麦增产中不能飞跃前进的缺点恰恰也就在这里。人家已经密植到一百二十万到二百四十万株，深耕的程度达到一点五尺到二尺，施肥量达到十万到二十万斤；而陕西省各地一般深耕的程度只有四、五寸深，施肥五、六千斤，密植三十多万株，高产地区也不过五、六十万株。农民们普遍认为像河南、湖北那样务弄庄稼，在关中也是可能的，问题在于有保守思想，过去没有敢于那样想那样作。
    是不是祖祖辈辈就没有亩产几千斤粮的事呢？就在这一点上怀疑论也没站住脚。西北农学院和长安县人民委员会在组织大辩论时，当场翻阅了许多中国古代农学著作。据元代王祯农书记载：当时就有用区田播种，每区收谷一斗，每亩收六十六石，收大豆十六石的高产纪录。汉代农学家氾胜之的农学著作，“氾胜之书”上记载：汉朝在我国北方黄河中游也有用区田种小麦十亩，每亩打一百石，折合起来合现在平均每亩产五千六百斤的纪录。农民们对这感到很大兴趣，他们说前人没有作到的，我们也能做到，何况前人已经作到了，现在的生产条件比封建社会好几百倍，为什么我们不能创造多的丰产纪录呢。这次大辩论为争取农业生产大跃进，打下了良好的思想基础。许多在过去慢慢吞吞的人也积极起来了。据六十个县、市的不完全统计，有一千多个农业社订出了在各种农作物中发射人造卫星的计划。
    农业科学家的怀疑思想也破除了。西北农学院的教授听了湖北、河南农民高额丰产经验介绍后，承认他们的许多措施确实是很科学的。他们说，碧蚂一号是他们培育出来的，但没有收到两千斤，而湖北、河南的农民能产到五千斤，是青出于蓝胜于蓝。他们要求这些代表把当地碧蚂一号种籽寄回来一些，供他们试验研究。西北农学院并和河南省来的农业社代表签订了联系合同。并派出讲师到河南双楼农业社去留学。
