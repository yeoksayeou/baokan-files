Xinhua News Agency, London, 24th - The British "Stop the War" Movement Committee was established in the House of Commons tonight, with Labour MP John Baird as chairman. The committee demands the complete withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

    In a petition to Prime Minister Macmillan, the committee stated, "We are deeply disturbed by the increasingly tense situation in the Middle East, and the presence of foreign troops in Jordan and Lebanon has exacerbated this tension. Interfering in the internal affairs of these two countries in order to support their declining regimes is likely to lead to another world war.

    "Therefore, we demand the complete withdrawal of British troops from Jordan as the first step towards reaching understanding and cooperation with the countries of the Middle East."

    Committee Chairman Baird said, "We believe that although we welcome summit talks, the situation cannot be resolved before the withdrawal of troops. Therefore, we believe there must be an organization to continue to protest."

    The committee also issued an appeal to the entire British people, calling on them to take action to stop the war. It called on people to send telegrams to the Prime Minister condemning the British aggression against Jordan and demanding the immediate withdrawal of British troops. It also called on people to send telegrams to Labour leader Gaitskell and their own constituency MPs, urging them to oppose British aggression in the Middle East. It called on people to hold protest rallies and demonstrations to oppose the government's "oil war" policy and "drive the Conservative Party out of power before the Conservative Party drags us (British people) into war."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 23rd - The British Independent Labour Party issued a statement today condemning the invasion of Jordan by British troops and the invasion of Lebanon by American troops as "typical examples of disregard for world peace, which capitalist countries do whenever they want to defend their profits."

    The Manchester Peace Committee, the Kersley (Yorkshire) branch and Rossington branch of the National Union of Mineworkers, the London Afro-Asian Students Committee, the workers of "Slap and Marberlitz Factory" in Cricklewood, and the Earls Court branch (London) of the National Union of Railwaymen also sharply condemned the Anglo-American armed intervention in Middle Eastern affairs.

    英成立“制止战争”运动委员会
    促使英军撤出约旦
    新华社伦敦24日电　英国“制止战争”运动委员会今天晚上在下院成立，工党议员约翰·贝尔德担任主席。这个委员会要求英军全部撤出约旦。
    委员会在给首相麦克米伦的请愿书里说，“我们对于越来越紧张的中东局势感到非常不安，外国军队驻在约旦和黎巴嫩加剧了这种紧张局势。为了支持这两个国家的衰亡的政权而干涉它们的内政，很可能导致另一次世界大战。
    “因此我们要求英军全部撤出约旦，作为同中东国家达成谅解和进行合作的第一步。”
    委员会主席贝尔德说：“我们认为，虽然我们欢迎举行最高级会谈，但是在撤军之前，局势是不能解决的。因此，我们认为必须有个组织来继续提出抗议。”
    委员会还向英国全体人民发出呼吁，呼吁他们行动起来制止战争。它要求人民拍电报给首相，谴责英国侵略约旦，并且要求英军立即撤出。它还呼吁人民拍电报给工党领袖盖次克尔以及他们自己选区的议员，要求他们反对英国在中东的侵略。它号召人民举行抗议大会和游行示威来反对政府的“石油战争”政策，并且“在保守党还没有把我们（英国人）赶进战争中去以前把保守党赶下台”。
    据新华社伦敦23日电　英国独立党今天发表声明，谴责英国军队侵略约旦和美国军队侵略黎巴嫩是“无视世界和平的典型事例，资本主义国家每当它们要保卫自己的利润的时候就要这样作。”
    曼彻斯特和平委员会，全国矿工联盟克尔斯利（约克郡）分会和罗辛顿分会、伦敦亚非学生委员会，克里克耳伍德“思腊普和马伯利兹工厂”工人、全国铁路工人工会埃耳斯—科尔特分会（伦敦）等组织也都尖锐地谴责英美武装干涉中东事务。
