Poetry Haven – Beiyinpo
By Our Correspondent Yu Changqin
There is a village where every family has a poet and every event inspires poetry. This village, located at the foot of Mount Song in Henan Province’s Dengfeng County, Dongjindian Township, is called Beiyinpo. We visited this village in mid-June. The moment we stepped into the village, we felt a strong cultural atmosphere. At the village entrance, a group of women were heading towards the fields, carrying hoes on their shoulders and books in their hands, reading as they walked. The earthen walls of the village, whitewashed with lime, were covered with colorful and vivid paintings full of realism and romanticism. One painting depicted a child pushing a cart loaded with a large, bright red peach; another showed children climbing ladders to husk corn cobs. Every household's door was adorned with a small blackboard, each blackboard filled with meaningful poems written in chalk, some praising the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the General Line for Socialist Construction; others combined current tasks like delivering manure, turning the soil, and harvesting wheat to inspire people to strive for the top.

This small village, with a total population of just 1,113 people of all ages, had written more than 14,000 works in the three months after eliminating illiteracy, the vast majority of which were poems. These poems touched on all aspects of people's lives, with content that was quite authentic, vividly descriptive, boldly spirited, and deeply moving, possessing a strong ideological and militant character. Many blackboards in this village displayed odes to the General Line for Socialist Construction. One poem read: "Flowers bloom brightly in summer, good news of the General Line spreads, the General Line's light shines ten thousand feet high, illuminating people's hearts, greatly liberating thought, uprooting rightist ideology!"

Using poetry to praise advanced individuals and advanced deeds, and to encourage everyone to learn from and catch up with the advanced, is one of the main forms of propaganda and mobilization in this village. A poem praising a young girl read: "There's a girl of eighteen, with rosy cheeks and oily black hair, not tall and not big, but she carries water with great strength, carrying fifteen loads of water in half a day, she's a sweet potato model!" Poetry is used to praise the advanced, and it is also used to criticize the backward, grasping both ends to bring along the middle. When Wang Jinbao was building a reservoir, he was not energetic in his labor, and someone immediately composed a song for him: "Wang Jinbao is over thirty, but he's not very good at work, he lazily raises his hoe, and doesn't put much soil in his basket, others work vigorously, but you're listless and sleepy, quickly muster up some energy, build the reservoir well and harvest more grain."

In any family in this village, there are several small blackboards. These blackboards are learning gardens for family members, as well as grounds for criticism and self-criticism. The poem "Mother Sheds the Illiteracy Cap" says: "Mother is fifty-eight years old, praised by everyone for her labor and production, she's also good at needlework, but she used to be uneducated; Chairman Mao called for the elimination of illiteracy, and Mother worked hard to learn, in half a year she learned 1,800 characters, she can write letters, and she can understand the newspaper!" After graduating from the literacy class, the old farmer Ma Youku stopped going to school. His son, Ma Depo, left a poem on the family's blackboard: "Let me say a word to you, Father, let's talk about learning today, you just graduated from literacy class, but you sit at home and don't read, if this goes on for half a year, you'll forget everything you've learned, quickly enroll in higher primary school, and strive to be advanced in both production and learning." After the old man saw his son's critical poem, he silently picked up his books and enrolled in the higher primary class.

Poetry also encourages people to march toward culture, toward technology, and toward nature. Ma Youshang's "Determination" poem says: "Mountains are no higher than our feet, although cultural learning is difficult, a thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, cannot stop the Beiyinpo students!" Bai Jingyue sang in the poem "Human Determination Surpasses Nature": "Let's see who's the most beautiful among the flowers, compare models on the production front; great achievements in water conservancy construction, Mount Song will also be controlled by people, floods obey and mountains are regulated, human determination can surpass nature!"

    诗歌胜地——背荫坡
    本报记者　于长钦
    有这样一个村庄，家家有诗人，事事出诗歌。这个村在中岳蒿山脚下，河南省登封县东金店乡，名叫背荫坡。六月中旬的一天，我们访问了这个村。一踏进村，就感到一种浓厚的文化气息。在村头，一群妇女正走向田间，肩扛锄头，手持书卷，边走边读。村里用白灰粉饰过的土墙上，到处是彩色艳丽的充满现实主义和浪漫主义情调的画。有一幅画着一个儿童用车子推着一个大鲜红桃子；有的画着儿童们登梯剥玉米棒。家家户户的门墙上，都有一块小黑板，块块黑板上都用粉笔写着富有深意的诗歌，有的是歌颂共产党、毛主席和社会主义建设总路线；有的结合当前送粪、翻地、打麦等，激发人们力争上游。
    这个老老少少总共不过一千一百一十三口人的小村，在扫除文盲后的三个月里，已经写出了一万四千多篇作品，其中绝大部分是诗歌。这些诗歌涉及到人们生活的各个方面，内容相当真实、形象具体、气势豪爽、生动感人，具有强烈的思想性和战斗性。这个村的许多黑板上都登载着对社会主义建设总路线的赞歌。有一首写道：“夏季里来鲜花开，总路线喜讯传下来，总路线光芒高万丈，照得人心亮堂堂，照得思想大解放，右倾思想连根拔！”
    用诗歌来表扬先进人物，先进事迹，鼓励大家学先进，赶先进，是这个村的主要宣传鼓动形式之一。有一首夸奖一个年轻姑娘的诗写道：“有个姑娘年十八，红红脸蛋油黑发，个子不高体不大，担起水桶劲儿大，半天担水十五担，红薯模范就是她！”用诗歌赞扬先进，也用它批评落后，抓两头，带中间。王金保在修水库的时候，劳动不起劲，有人当场给他编了一个歌：“王金保三十多，就是干活不咋着，手拿镢头懒得举，筐里装土也不多，别人干的满起劲，你暮气沉沉像睡着，赶快鼓起一股劲，修好水库打粮多。”
    在这个村中的任何一个家庭里，都有几块小黑板，这些黑板是家庭成员的学习园地，也是批评和自我批评的园地。在“母亲摘掉文盲帽”的诗中说：“母亲年高五十八，劳动生产人人夸，针线活儿也不错，就是从前没文化；毛主席号召扫文盲，母亲苦心学文化，半年识字一千八，书信她会写，报纸她看懂啦！”老农麻有库在扫盲学习班毕业后，就不再上学了。他的儿子麻德坡就在家中小黑板上留诗一首：“叫一声父亲听我言，今天把学习谈一谈，扫盲你刚毕了业，坐在家中书不看，这样再有半年整，你所学的全忘完，现在快把高小上，生产学习都争先。”老头子看到儿子的批评诗后，就一声不响地拿起书本，到高小班报了名。
    诗歌还鼓励人们向文化进军，向技术进军，向大自然进军。在麻有上作的“决心”诗中说：“山高不过脚面，文化学习虽困难，千难万难，难不住背荫坡学员！”白景跃在“人定胜过大自然”的诗里唱道：“百花之中看谁鲜，生产战线比模范；水利建设成就大，嵩山也要受人管，洪水听话山听调，人定能胜大自然！”
