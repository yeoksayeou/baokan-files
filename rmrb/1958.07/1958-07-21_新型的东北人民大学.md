    The New Northeastern People's University

    In the beautiful city center of Changchun, there is a new type of comprehensive university—Northeastern People's University.

    Northeastern People's University has grown up under the direct leadership and cultivation of the Party and the government. It was founded in Harbin in 1946, originally named the Northeastern Administrative College, which was then a cadre school. After the national liberation, with the strong support of the Party and the government, and after the national restructuring of colleges and departments in 1952, Northeastern People's University developed into a new type of comprehensive university. Now it has a considerable scale, with seven departments and majors in mathematics, physics, chemistry, Chinese (Chinese Language and Literature), history, economics (political economy), and law. Among them, the physics and chemistry majors are further divided into specializations such as metal physics, magnetism, optics, semiconductor physics, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, and polymer chemistry. This year, a computational mathematics major and a chemistry training course have also been added. There are currently more than 3,000 students and more than 400 teachers. In the process of its establishment, Northeastern People's University inherited the tradition of hard work and struggle from the liberated areas, developing from scratch and growing from small to large. In 1949, the school did not have a single piece of equipment. The experimental tables were made of wooden boards, and the alcohol lamps were homemade from ink bottles. But now each department has established forty-nine kinds of laboratories and a historical relic exhibition room. All of these have basically met the needs of teaching and scientific research.

    After the rectification movement, a situation of great development, great reform, and great leap forward has now emerged in Northeastern People's University. The whole school is striving to completely become a communist university within three years. In order to implement the policy of combining education and labor, the school has recently established more than 40 factories, including cutting-edge factories manufacturing semiconductor equipment, counting tubes, and high-resistance materials. While preparing for the establishment of factories, scientific research has also achieved great success. In less than ten days, more than a hundred new products have been successfully trial-produced, many of which have reached the world's advanced level.

    新型的东北人民大学
    在美丽的长春市中心，有一所新型的综合性大学——东北人民大学。
    东北人民大学是在党和政府直接领导和培育下成长起来的。它在1946年成立于哈尔滨，原名为东北行政学院，当时是一所干部学校。全国解放后，在党和政府大力支持下，经1952年全国院系调整，东北人民大学发展成为一所新型的综合性大学。现在它已经具有相当规模，全校设有数学、物理、化学、中文（汉语言文学）、历史、经济
  （政治经济学）、法律等七个系和专业；其中物理和化学两个专业，还分设有金属物理、磁学、光学、半导体物理、无机化学、分析化学、有机化学、高分子化学等专门化。今年还增设了计算数学专业和化学专修科。现有学生三千余人。教师四百余人。东北人民大学在创建过程中，继承了解放区艰苦奋斗的传统，从无到有，从小到大发展起来。1949年，学校中没有一件仪器设备。实验台是用木板搭起来的，酒精灯是用墨水瓶自制的。但是现在各系已建立了四十九种实验室和一个历史文物陈列室。所有这些都已基本上满足了教学和科学研究的需要。
    经过整风运动，现在东北人民大学已出现了一个大发展、大改革、大跃进的形势，全校正在为在三年内使学校完全成为一个共产主义大学而奋斗。为了贯彻教育和劳动结合的方针，最近，学校中已经建立了四十多个工厂，其中有制造半导体器材、计数管、高电阻等尖端性工厂。在筹建工厂的同时，科学研究也获得很大成就，不到十天中已试制成功百多种新产品，其中有很多产品达到世界上先进水平。
