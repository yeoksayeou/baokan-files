Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 3rd: The Jinggangshan Highway was completed and officially opened to traffic on July 1st.

    This highway was originally planned to be completed in two years, but it only took four months. It runs through the three counties of Taihe, Yongxin, and Suichuan, with a total length of 120 kilometers. The project was extremely difficult, with more than 110,000 cubic meters of rock and earth excavation alone. The early opening of this highway will greatly accelerate the construction of Jinggangshan. The construction speed of hydroelectric power stations, copper factories, iron factories, cement factories, wineries, paper mills, wood processing factories, rayon factories, roasted glue factories, and litsea cubeba oil factories that are under construction or planned to be built will be accelerated; pine, fir, bamboo, and various precious miscellaneous trees will also be developed relatively quickly.

    On July 1st, a highway opening ceremony was held in Taihe, and Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Jiangxi Province, cut the ribbon. After the ribbon-cutting, a long line of cars drove to Jinggangshan, and the masses cheered along the way. At 3 p.m., the cars drove into Ciping, the center of Jinggangshan, and a celebration meeting was held in the rain. At the meeting, Shao Shiping and Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered speeches. (Attached picture)

    井冈山公路通车
    新华社南昌3日电　井冈山公路在1日竣工并正式通车。
    这条公路原计划两年建成，现在只用了四个月。全线贯通泰和、永新、遂川三县，共长一百二十公里。工程非常艰巨，只开山石方就有十一万多方。这条公路提前通车，将大大加速井冈山的建设。正在着手建设和计划兴建的水电站、铜厂、铁厂、水泥厂、酒厂、纸厂、木材加工厂、人造纤维厂、烤胶厂和山苍子厂等工厂的建设速度，将可以加快；松、杉、竹和各种名贵杂木也将比较快地得到开发。
    7月1日，在泰和举行了公路通车典礼，由中共江西省委书记、省长邵式平剪彩。剪彩后，长列汽车开往井冈山，沿途群众夹道欢呼。下午三时汽车驶入井冈山的中心点茨坪，在大雨中举行了庆祝大会。会上邵式平和中共江西省委书记刘俊秀讲了话。（附图片）
