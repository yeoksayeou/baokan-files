Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25th: Residents of Dachen Island on the Zhejiang front and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the island are angrily protesting the American and British imperialist aggression against the Middle East, resolutely demanding that American and British troops get out of the Middle East, and American troops get out of Taiwan. They also voiced their determination to contribute all their strength to liberate Taiwan.

Nearly a thousand fishermen, farmers, residents, and stationed officers and soldiers held a protest rally late on the 22nd. Xu Jisheng, the town chief of Dachen Town, said at the meeting: The towering crimes committed by American imperialism on Dachen Island are still fresh in the memory of the people of Dachen. The evil traces of the American invaders on Dachen have not yet been erased, and now they dare to extend their bloody hands of aggression to the people of the Middle East. We are extremely angry, and we resolutely demand that the invading troops immediately get out of the Middle East and our territory of Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, and we must ensure that the more than 18,000 peaceful residents of Dachen who were abducted to Taiwan by the American and Chiang Kai-shek forces return to rebuild their homes.

The head of the stationed troops on the island called on all officers and soldiers on the island to be a hundred times more vigilant, hold their weapons tightly, and make all preparations for the liberation of our territory of Taiwan, ready to strike the enemy at any time.

After representatives of fishermen and farmers denounced and protested the crimes of the American invaders in plundering Dachen at the meeting, they proposed to be ready at any time to fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
