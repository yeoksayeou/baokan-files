    Primary Education Universally Available to Children in Pastoral Areas
    Seven-Year Education Universally Available to Children in Cities
    In order to realize the resolution of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on continuing to make primary education universal for school-age children in pastoral areas and seven-year education universal for children in cities during 1958-1960, the Council of Ministers recently decided to carry out the work of popularizing seven-year education in the provincial capitals and cities across the country in stages.

    The work of popularizing seven-year education will be launched in the provincial capitals of eight provinces, including Ulaanbaatar, Choibalsan, Khovd, and Bayan-Ölgii, starting from September 1 this year. This work will be launched in the provincial capitals of nine provinces, including Arkhangai, Khuvsgul, Bulgan, and Dundgovi, starting from September 1 next year. Seven-year education will be universally implemented in all cities with seven-year and ten-year middle schools within the next three years.

    Mongolia's education undertaking has developed rapidly. 97.9% of school-age children are enrolled in schools, completing the plan put forward by the 12th Party Congress to make primary education universal for school-age children. Currently, there are more than 90,000 primary and secondary school students, plus more than 100,000 students in universities and specialized schools. During the second five-year plan, the task of eliminating illiteracy among adults has been basically completed.

    牧区儿童普遍受初等教育
    城市儿童普遍受七年教育
    为了实现蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会关于在1958—1960年内继续使牧区学龄儿童普遍受初等教育、使城市儿童普遍受七年制教育的决议，最近部长会议决定在全国各省会、市分期开展普及七年制教育的工作。
    在乌兰巴托市、乔巴山、科布多、巴彦乌列盖等八个省的省会，从今年9月1日起展开普及七年制教育的工作；在后杭爱、库苏古尔、布拉干、中戈壁等九省的省会，从明年9月1日起展开这种工作。凡在设有七年级和十年级中学的城市，都要在今后三年内普及七年制教育。
    蒙古教育事业发展迅速，全国已有97.9％的学龄儿童入学，完成了十二次党代表大会所提出的使学龄儿童普遍受到初等教育的计划。目前中小学学生已达九万多人，加上大学和专科学校的学生共有十万多人。在第二个五年计划期间，已基本上完成了成年人的扫盲任务。
