Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 2nd. At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the USSR's Supreme Soviet, Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovakian Republic, arrived in Moscow at 1:30 this afternoon aboard a special "Tu-104" plane.

We are united by the great ideas of communism, the ideas of peace and happiness for all peoples.
