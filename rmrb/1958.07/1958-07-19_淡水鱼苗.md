    Freshwater Fish Fry

    China has approximately 500 species of freshwater fish, mainly Cyprinidae, followed by Siluridae and Cobitidae. Before liberation, the annual output of freshwater fish in the country was 500,000 tons. After liberation, it gradually increased, reaching 1,176,000 tons in 1957. The output of freshwater fish includes both natural fishing and artificial breeding. In the past, fishing was always more than breeding; however, this has begun to change since 1957, and this year the output of breeding is estimated to be more than four times that of fishing.

    The key to developing freshwater fish farming production is the supply of fish fry. There are two sources of fish fry: obtaining them from nature and artificial hatching. China has numerous rivers and a mild climate, and the natural conditions are superior, making the fish fry resources extremely rich. Carp, crucian carp, and bream fry are produced everywhere and can be obtained and stocked locally. However, high-quality fish fry such as black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp are only produced in large water areas such as the Yangtze River, West River, Xiang River, Han River, and Gan River.

    In recent years, thanks to the Party and the government's attention to fish fry production, strengthening resource reproduction protection, improving fish fry production, transportation and technical equipment, the national output of the above four kinds of high-quality fish fry in 1957 increased by 70% compared with the highest level before the war. As of July this year, incomplete statistics show that it has reached 21.5 billion fry.

    As the development speed of freshwater fish farming across the country is increasing rapidly, the number of fish fry needed is growing daily. Therefore, how to solve the problem of artificial hatching of the above-mentioned high-quality fish species and adjust the shortage of natural fish fry is of utmost importance to further develop China's freshwater fish farming industry.

    淡水鱼苗
    我国淡水鱼类约五百种，以鲤科为主，其次是鲶科和鳅科。解放前全国淡水鱼年产量是五十万吨，解放后逐步增长，1957年产量达一百一十七点六万吨。淡水鱼产量包括捕捞天然鱼类和人工养殖，过去一直是捕多于养；但自1957年以后已开始改变，今年养殖产量估计将超过捕捞的四倍。
    发展淡水养鱼生产的关键是鱼苗供应工作。鱼苗来源有两方面：取自天然和实行人工孵化。我国江河纵横，气候温和，自然条件优越，鱼苗资源极为丰富。鲤、鲫、鳊等鱼苗遍地均产，可以就地取材，就地放养。但青、草、鲢、鳙等优良鱼苗，仅产于长江、西江、湘江、汉水和赣江等大水域。
    几年来，由于党和政府对鱼苗生产的重视，加强资源繁殖保护，改进鱼苗生产、运输和技术设备，1957年全国以上四种优良鱼苗产量较战前最高水平增长70％。今年截至7月份不完全统计已达二百一十五亿尾。
    由于当前全国淡水养鱼的发展速度一日千里，鱼苗需要数量日益增长，因此，如何解决以上优良鱼种的人工孵化问题，调剂天然鱼苗的不足，对进一步发展我国淡水养鱼事业有着极其重要的意义。
