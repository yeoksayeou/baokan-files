    Willow Catkins Cannot Be Used as Textile Fiber
    Recently, some readers have written suggesting the use of willow catkins as textile fiber. After we contacted the Textile Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Textile Industry, they replied that although willow catkin fiber is finer than cotton wadding, its length and strength are very weak, and it also contains seeds, so it cannot be spun by machine. It can be used as filling material.

    柳絮不能作纺织纤维
    近来有些读者来信建议利用柳絮作纺织纤维，经我们与纺织工业部纺织科学研究院联系后，他们回信说柳絮纤维虽然比棉絮细，但长度强力很弱，又带有籽粒，因而不能通过机器纺纱，可作填充物利用。
