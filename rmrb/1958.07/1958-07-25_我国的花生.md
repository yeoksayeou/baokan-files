    China's Peanuts

    Peanut is one of China's main oil crops. Peanuts occupy an extremely important position in oil production. Taking 1957 as an example, the country's peanut planting area reached approximately 38 million mu, accounting for about 30% of oil crops (excluding soybeans), while the output accounted for more than 60% of the total oil crop production.

    Peanuts have many uses. One hundred catties of peanut kernels can produce about 45 catties of oil and more than 50 catties of cake after processing. Peanut oil is one of the most important edible oils for the Chinese people and is also a raw material for manufacturing artificial cheese and some canned goods. Peanut cake is rich in nutrition and can be mixed with flour and rice flour to make various snacks and side foods. It is also a good feed and fertilizer. The stems and vines of peanuts also have high nutritional value as feed. According to popular experience, the stems and vines of four mu of peanuts can basically meet the feed needs of one pig for one year. Peanut shells can be used as roughage, and can also be used to extract alcohol and manufacture rayon.

    China's peanuts are widely distributed, from Taiwan in the east to Xinjiang in the west, and from Hainan Island in the south to Heilongjiang in the north. They are grown in plains, sandy lands, or barren hills. Regionally, the most cultivated area is the northern Bohai region (including Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces), which accounts for about 40% of the country's total peanut area. Shandong Province alone accounts for more than one-quarter of the country's peanut area. The Yellow River and Huai River sandy soil areas (including Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces) are also planted quite a bit, accounting for about 25% of the total area. The South China hilly areas (including Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces) also have about 20% of the total peanut area. Other regions, except for Hubei and Sichuan provinces, which each have a planting area of more than one million mu, have relatively few.

    In China's northern single-cropping areas, spring peanuts are sown in early and mid-May. In most areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and Yangtze River, summer peanuts are planted. In southern Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places, due to the warm climate and complex cultivation system, peanuts are planted in spring, summer, and partly in autumn. The peanuts cultivated in various places are either planted as a single crop or intercropped with corn.

    China has great potential for increasing peanut production. Large areas of sandy wasteland in the north and large areas of red soil wasteland in the south can be reclaimed for peanut cultivation.

    我国的花生
    花生是我国主要油料作物之一。花生在油料生产中占着极重要的地位，以1957年为例，全国花生的种植面积约达三千八百多万亩，占油料作物（不包括大豆）的30％左右，而产量却占油料作物总产量的60％以上。
    花生的用途很大。一百斤花生仁经过加工，可以出油四十五斤左右，出饼五十多斤。花生油是我国人民最主要的食用油之一，也是制造人造乳酪和一些罐头的原料。花生饼含有丰富的营养，可以掺和面粉、米粉做出各种点心和副食品，同时又是很好的饲料和肥料。花生茎蔓作饲料的营养价值也很高，据群众经验，四亩花生的茎蔓，基本上可以满足一头猪一年的饲料需要。花生果壳除可用作粗饲料外，还可以提炼酒精和制造人造丝。
    我国的花生分布很广，东起台湾，西至新疆，南起海南岛，北至黑龙江，无论平原沙地或丘陵瘠地都有种植。从地区上看，栽培最多的为北方渤海地区（包括山东、河北和辽宁三省），约占全国花生总面积的40％，其中山东一个省的花生面积占全国花生面积的四分之一多。黄河淮河沙土地区（包括河南、安徽和江苏三省）也种植的不少，花生面积约占总面积的25％左右。华南丘陵地区（包括广东、广西和福建三省），也有约占花生总面积20％的花生。其他各地除湖北、四川两省种植面积各在一百万亩以上外，其余省份都较少。
    我国北方一年一熟地区，都是5月上、中旬播种的春播花生。黄河长江中下游各地大部是夏播花生。南方的广东、广西、云南等地，因气候暖和，栽培制度复杂，花生有春播的、夏播的和部分秋播的。各地栽培的花生，有单一种植的，也有花生和玉米一起间作的。
    我国花生增产的潜力很大，北方的大片沙荒、南方的大片红壤荒地，都可以开垦种植花生。
