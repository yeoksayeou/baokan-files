Stage and Screen

    This play tells the story of how a female cadre of the New Fourth Army mobilized peasants to fight against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the enemy-occupied areas of northern Jiangsu during the Liberation War. The actors of the Jiangsu Province Xiju Troupe are very capable of capturing the audience. What is impressive is the characterization of the characters, both positive and negative, which have both commonality and individuality, and their psychological states are very rich and distinctive. For example, the positive characters are all clear in their positions and full of fighting spirit, but the female cadre Hua Xiaofeng's characteristic is that she is resourceful, bold, calm and firm, the widow Zhang Suzhen's characteristic is that she is brave, violent, beautiful and affectionate, and the poor peasant Wang Laoer's characteristic is that he is honest and loyal, and unyielding in the face of execution. The negative characters, such as the pseudo-township head, show the commonality of wolves and tigers in different personalities such as treacherousness, the Hu Battalion Commander from ferocity, and the businessman Qian Fuchang from cunning. In addition, the actors appropriately used some traditional performance programs of opera to perform this modern drama, which was quite successful. It is particularly commendable that in the scene of the Hu Battalion Commander tearing up the slogans, the actor used the actions of a Jing role in Peking Opera to perform the Hu Battalion Commander's irritable anger, murderous aura, and helplessness, which not only did not make people feel stiff, but also felt that this was the most appropriate way to perform.

    锡剧“红色的种子”
    这个戏写的是解放战争期间，新四军的一个女干部如何在苏北敌战区发动农民向蒋匪帮斗争的故事。江苏省锡剧团演员，很能抓住观众。给人印象很深的是演员们塑造的一些人物形象，不论正反面，都是既有共性又有个性，心理状态十分丰富多采而又各具特色。例如正面人物都是立场鲜明、斗志旺盛的，但女干部华小凤的特色是机智大胆、沉着坚定，寡妇张素贞特色是勇敢暴烈、美丽多情，贫农王老二特色是忠厚老实、临刑不屈。又如反面人物，伪乡长从奸险、胡大队长从凶狠、商人钱福昌从刁猾等不同的个性里，显现出了狼豺虎豹的共性来。此外，演员们适当地运用了戏曲上一些传统的表演程式来表演这个现代剧，相当成功。特别值得称道的是胡大队长撕标语一场，演员用了京剧净角的动作来表演胡大队长暴躁盛怒、杀气腾腾而又无可奈何的姿态，不仅使人毫不觉得生硬，而且感到似乎只有这样表演才最恰当。　（申）
