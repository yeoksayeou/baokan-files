Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 10th. The Jakarta "People's Daily" published on July 8th a speech by Yudo, Second Deputy General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered on the 6th of July in Jakarta, regarding his impressions of his visits abroad. Yudo attended the Seventh Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party as an observer and visited the Soviet Union, Poland, China, Burma, and other countries. In his speech, he refuted the revisionist program of the Yugoslav Communist Party and Tito's reactionary speech in Labin.

Yudo stated in his speech that he was quoting the statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party in June this year. The statement indicated that the Indonesian Communist Party could not accept the principles, arguments, and positions of the Yugoslav Communist program.

Yudo said that in April, when the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist Party was adopted at the Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, an article written by former Indonesian Vice President Hatta was published in the American journal "Foreign Affairs," titled "Indonesia Between the Great Powers." Comparing Tito's speech with Hatta's article reveals many similarities.

The Yugoslav Communist program states: "The United Nations...can become the hub of a democratic machine...can help achieve a more complete world unity." Hatta in his article advocates "eliminating the opposition and contradictions between the two blocs within the United Nations framework."

Yudo said that such hope is truly a fantasy when the United Nations is still controlled by the American majority vote machine. Furthermore, what is meant by a more complete "world unity"? Is the current world already "united" but simply not "complete" enough? When one part of the world is socialist and the other part is capitalist, can it be said that the world is "united"? If we read the part of the Yugoslav Communist program discussing the "unity issue," we can see that they truly hope for a "process of world economic unity" that does not require changing production relations, that is, does not require changing the social system. According to the Yugoslav Communist program, the "free development of all nations" can be achieved through "the more rapid development of productive forces in the world."

According to Hatta, "Capitalism has changed"; the Yugoslav Communist program also talks about "changes in the capitalist system." According to Hatta, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie "is no longer as acute"; while the Yugoslav Communist "program" says this contradiction has "new characteristics." Hatta says that "many socialist ideals that were simply rejected by the bourgeoisie in the past are now being upheld by them," thus turning the "social democratic movement," which was originally a "destructive faction," into a "constructive force"; while the Yugoslav Communist program says that "the ruling classes in developed capitalist countries are capable, to a greater extent, of satisfying the material demands of certain parts of the working class, and even satisfying their democratic demands, both economically and politically," and this supposedly "also affects" the "formation of the political consciousness" of certain parts of the working class.

After discussing the "objective process of social development" that exists "which makes the current capitalist society increasingly closer to socialism," the Yugoslav Communist program also says that "humanity and all other economic and social relations...are moving towards the era of transition to a socialist society. Socialism is increasingly becoming the practice of all people and is being transformed into a single world process."

Yudo said that if it is difficult or relatively difficult for everyone to understand the wording of the Yugoslav Communist program, then this is probably because, as Engels said, grandiose words are used to explain very simple problems. In the simplest terms, what the Yugoslav Communist leaders mainly want to say is: the world is already leaning towards socialism and will naturally reach socialism, because capitalism has changed, is already willing to meet the demands of the working class, and now as long as the working class puts a little more pressure on the bourgeoisie, capitalism will turn into socialism.

Yudo said, if the working class in capitalist countries believes the Yugoslav Communist program and thinks that capitalism is truly leaning towards socialism, then why should we work hard and struggle? Isn't this very simple and easy to understand? Fortunately—and this cannot but be the case—the working class around the world is not as naive and childish as children.

Yudo said, now I continue to compare the Yugoslav Communist leaders with Hatta. Regarding relations with the United States, Hatta said, "The relationship between Indonesia and the United States is basically good, and the Indonesian people value the assistance the United States has given them"; now let us pay attention to Tito's words: "Our relationship with the United States is based on mutual respect...if there are some expressions that do not conform to these principles, they usually come from individuals or aspects, and not from the United States government. We accepted economic and military assistance from the United States when we were in great need...this was very beneficial to us...it is incorrect and unreasonable to deny the great significance of the assistance we received during a very difficult period." That is what Tito said, but this does not include everything.

Just as Hatta hopes for more "assistance" from the United States, Tito also said that American "assistance in the form of loans will certainly be more suitable for us..."

The difference between Hatta's article and Tito's speech is that Hatta still criticizes the United States to some extent, especially the United States' consistent support for the Netherlands on the West Irian issue; while in Tito's speech, I wanted to find criticism of the United States, but to no avail. On the contrary, Tito constantly believes that the "assistance" from the United States "has no constraints." But what did Hatta say about the American "aid" issue? Hatta said, "If the United States wants to assist a certain country, the United States imposes its views and opinions too much, and pays too little attention to the wishes and opinions of the nation concerned." Isn't this the most prominent political constraint of every kind of American "aid"?

Yudo said that Tito answered the criticism from the Chinese Communist Party at a mass rally in Labin on June 15th. He said that Tito not only described the Chinese criticism as "fabricated," "unprincipled," "inhuman," etc., but also said "majestically," "everything I say is right."

Yudo said that all communist leaders, including Comrade Aidit, have said that the attitude of the Yugoslav Communist leaders is beneficial to imperialism, but Tito said in his speech in Labin, "I have never praised imperialism." Yudo pointed out that Tito has said that American "aid" "has no constraints," but in reality, it has constraints; or he has said that the United States "does not interfere in internal affairs" in its relations with any other country, but in reality, it interferes in internal affairs. Are these not praises of imperialism? It seems that President Sukarno's attitude in this regard is far more correct than that of the Yugoslav Communist leaders. President Sukarno often says that if the imperialists scold us, it shows that we are correct; conversely, if the imperialists praise us, then we should be suspicious of ourselves. Yudo finally introduced the true face of Yugoslavia under the revisionist rule of the Yugoslav Communist leaders. He said that Yugoslavia's industry is generally managed by "workers' committees," "in my opinion, the situation is close to anarchy." He pointed out that the vast majority of agriculture is still privately owned. He said, "In terms of culture, I personally saw that abstract paintings and sculptures are far more dominant than realist ones; how dominant are American songs with Serbian lyrics; and how American nude pictures are also published in Yugoslav central newspapers; the American films screened are far more than Yugoslav films, and more than Italian, British, and French films, not to mention Soviet films. The ideological impact of all this, especially on the minds of young people, is conceivable."

    印度尼西亚共产党第二副总书记约多
    驳斥南共纲领和铁托的反动演说
    铁托集团统治下的南斯拉夫真面目是：工业情况接近于无政府状态，农业方面绝大部分是私有的，美国黄色文化泛滥……。
    新华社雅加达10日电　雅加达“人民日报”8日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党第二副总书记约多6日在雅加达发表的关于出国访问观感的演说。约多曾经以观察员身分出席了南共第七次代表大会，并且访问了苏联、波兰、中国、缅甸等国家。他在演说中驳斥了南共修正主义纲领和铁托在拉宾发表的反动演说。
    约多在演说中引述了印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局在今年6月间发表的声明。这项声明表示印度尼西亚共产党不能接受南共纲领的原则、论点和立场。
    约多说，4月里当南共纲领草案在南共大会上被通过的时候，在美国的外交季刊上发表了印度尼西亚前副总统哈达所写的一篇文章，题目是“印度尼西亚在大国集团之间”，把南斯拉夫领导人铁托的演说和哈达的这篇文章比较一下，就可以看出两者有许多共同点。
    南共纲领写道：“联合国……可以成为民主机器的中枢……可以帮助实现更完整的世界统一”。哈达在他的文章里主张“在联合国范围内消除两个集团之间的对立和矛盾”。
    约多说，当联合国还被美国的多数票机器控制的时候，这样的希望真正是一种幻想。再说什么叫做更完整的“世界统一”呢？是否目前的世界已经“统一”而只是不够“完整”？当世界的一部分是社会主义而另一部分是资本主义的时候，难道可以说世界是“统一”的吗？如果我们读到南共纲领中论述“统一问题”的部分，可以看出他们确实希望出现不必改变生产关系，也就是不必改变社会制度的“世界经济统一的过程”。根据南共纲领，“各民族的自由发展”可以通过“世界上的生产力的更迅速的发展”而实现。
    据哈达说，“资本主义已经改变”；南共纲领也谈论关于“资本主义制度中的变化”。根据哈达的说法，工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾“已经不大尖锐”；而南共“纲领”说这种矛盾已具有“新的特点”。哈达说，“有许多过去被资产阶级干脆拒绝的社会主义的理想，现在他们正在加以维护”，从而使原来成为“破坏性的派别”的“社会民主运动”现在变为“建设性的力量”；而南共纲领说，“发达的资本主义国家的统治阶层不论在经济方面或者政治方面都有能力在较大的程度上满足工人阶级的特定部分的物质要求，甚至满足他们的民主要求”，而这种据说“也影响了”工人阶级的特定部分的“政治觉悟的形成”。
    南共纲领在谈论了关于存在着“使目前的资本主义社会日益接近社会主义”的“社会发展的客观过程”以后又说，“人类及其他一切经济关系和社会关系……正在走向社会主义社会过渡的时代，社会主义日益成为一切人民的实践，并且正在改变为单一的世界过程”。
    约多说，如果大家难于或较难于理解南共纲领的词句，那么这恐怕正是如恩格斯所说的用冠冕堂皇的词句来说明非常简单的问题的缘故。如果用最简明的话来说，南共领导人要说的主要是：这个世界已经倾向社会主义，从而自然地将达到社会主义，因为资本主义已经改变，已经愿意满足工人阶级的要求，现在只要工人阶级对资产阶级再加一点压力，资本主义就会变为社会主义。
    约多说，如果资本主义国家的工人阶级相信南共纲领而以为资本主义真正已经倾向社会主义，那么我们何必努力工作和斗争？这难道不是非常浅显易懂吗？幸运的是——而这也不能不是这样——全世界的工人阶级并不像小孩那样天真和幼稚。
    约多说，现在我继续把南共领导人和哈达作比较。关于同美国的关系，哈达说，“印度尼西亚和美国的关系基本上是良好的，印度尼西亚人民重视美国给他们的援助”；现在让我们注意铁托的话：“我们同美国的关系建立在互相尊重……的基础上，……如果有某些不符这些原则的表现，那通常是来自个人或方面，那不是来自美国政府，我们在非常需要援助的时候接受了美国的经济和军事援助……这非常有利于我们，……如果我们否定我们在非常困难的时期接受的援助的巨大意义是不正确的也是不合情理的”。铁托就是这样说，但是这些还没有包括一切。
    正如哈达希望美国更多的“援助”一样，铁托也说美国“贷款方式的援助必然将对我们更适合……”。
    哈达的文章和铁托的演说的区别是：哈达多少还批评美国，特别是批评美国在西伊里安问题上一味援助荷兰的态度；而在铁托的演说里我想找到对美国的批评，结果是白费力气，相反地，铁托不断地认为美国的“援助”是“没有任何约束性”的。但哈达在美“援”问题上怎么说呢？哈达说，“如果美国想援助某国，则美国过多地强加其看法和意见，而太少注意有关的民族的愿望和意见”。这不是每一种美“援”的最显著的政治约束的表现吗？
    约多说，铁托6月15日在拉宾的群众大会上回答中国共产党的批评。他说，铁托不但把中国的批评说成是“假造”、“无原则”、“无人道”等等，而且还“威风”地说，“我所说的一切是对的”。
    约多说，一切共产党领袖包括艾地同志在内都说南共领导人的态度是对帝国主义有利的，可是铁托在拉宾发表的演说中却说，“我不曾赞扬帝国主义”。约多指出，铁托说过美“援”“并没有约束性”，而实际上是有约束性；或者说过美国在同任何其他国家的关系上“没有干涉内政”，而实际上是干涉内政。这些难道不是赞扬帝国主义吗？看来苏加诺总统在这方面的态度远比南共领导人正确。苏加诺总统常说，如果帝国主义者大骂我们，这说明我们是正确的；相反，如果帝国主义者赞扬我们，那我们就应该对自己表示怀疑。约多最后介绍了在南共领导人的修正主义统治下目前南斯拉夫的真面目。他说，南斯拉夫的工业一般由“工人委员会”管理，“照我的看法情况已接近于无政府状态”。他指出，农业方面绝大部分还是私有的。他说，“在文化方面，我亲自看到抽象派的绘画和雕塑远比现实主义派占有统治地位；配以塞尔维亚歌词的美国歌曲也占有何等的统治地位；而美国的裸体图片如何也在南斯拉夫的中央报纸上登出；上映的美国影片比南斯拉夫自己的影片多得多，也比意大利、英国、法国的影片更不用说比苏联影片多得多。这一切在思想上的影响特别是对青年思想的影响是可想而知的。”
