Selling Goods While Imparting Technology
Sichuan's Broad Masses of Grassroots Commercial Personnel Become Proficient in Commerce, Industry, and Technology

Chengdu, July 26 (This newspaper reports) – More than 100,000 grassroots commercial workers in Sichuan Province, after becoming proficient in commerce, industry, and agriculture, are further展开[zhǎn kāi] = to carry out; to launch; to unfold deploying a technological revolution, striving to ensure that everyone is not only a salesperson but also a technician and a propagandist for technological revolution.

In the past, when commercial departments promoted agricultural tools, they did not understand the technology themselves, and could not repair them when they broke down. In many places, the phenomenon of goods being unsalable after purchase occurred. Since the beginning of this year, commercial departments in Sichuan Province have participated in production, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. According to statistics from only seven special districts including Wanxian, Daxian, and Nanchong, and three cities including Chengdu, Chongqing, and Zigong, commercial departments have formally built and put into production more than 18,800 factories. The agricultural experimental fields established by commercial departments in rural areas are also very widespread. However, after commercial departments establish factories, they need personnel familiar with technology. After products are produced, they need salespeople who understand the performance and specifications of the goods to introduce them to the masses. Therefore, it is a major issue that commercial departments urgently need to solve at present, to participate in technological innovation and pass on technology to the masses.

In order to solve this problem, the commercial departments of Sichuan Province have implemented the policy of "technology first, promotion later" and "goods out the door, technology down to the countryside." The staff of the Lanjiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Suining County, in order to quickly promote the sixty kinds of improved agricultural tools, double-barreled sprayers, water bellows, etc. that they created and imitated, went to the countryside to promote them with tools and parts for repairing agricultural tools. They imparted technology on the spot and helped farmers convert old agricultural tools into new ones.

Many commercial departments have also established technical night schools and technical training classes, lecturing on the cultivation techniques of various crops, the use and protection methods of new agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pharmaceutical machinery.

Many commercial departments have also established technical reform guidance stations to promote technological innovation. The Huacong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Bazhong County, in cooperation with the local Communist Youth League organization and agricultural technology station, established a technology dissemination network in the entire district, ensuring that every township has a technology dissemination station and every cooperative has a technology guidance group, and organized 365 typical demonstration viewings, enabling more than 100,000 people to acquire knowledge of using new agricultural tools.

    出售商品同时传授技术
    四川广大基层商业人员通商、通工、通技术
    本报成都26日电　四川省十万多名基层商业工作人员，在通商通工通农以后，进一步展开技术革命，力争人人做到既是业务员，又是技术员和技术革命的宣传员。
    过去商业部门在推广农具的时候，由于自己不懂技术，坏了也不会修理，许多地方都发生进货卖不出去的现象。今年以来，四川省商业部门参与生产以后，促进了工农业生产的发展。仅据万县、达县、南充等七个专区和成都、重庆、自贡三个市统计，商业部门正式建成投入生产的工厂就有一万八千八百多个；商业部门在农村建立的农业试验田也十分广泛。但是，各地商业部门在建立工厂以后，需要熟悉技术的人员；产品生产以后，需要有懂得商品性能、规格技术的营业员向群众介绍，因此，商业部门参加技术革新，把技术传授给群众，是当前商业部门迫切需要解决的一个重大问题。
    为了解决这个问题，四川省商业部门贯彻了“技术在先，推广在后”、“货物出门、技术下乡”的方针。遂宁县栏江区供销合作社的职工，为使自己创造、仿造的六十种薅秧器、双管喷雾器、水风箱等改良农具迅速推广，带上修理农具的工具、零件下乡推广。当场传授技术，并帮助农民把旧农具改为新式农具。
    许多商业部门还创办技术夜校和技术训练班。讲授各种农作物的栽培技术、新式农具和肥料、药械的使用和保护方法。
    不少商业部门还建立了技术改革指导站，促进技术革新。巴中县花丛区供销社在当地共青团组织、农技站协同下，在全区建立了技术传授网，做到乡乡有技术传授站、社社有技术指导小组，并组织典型示范观摩三百六十五次，使十万多群众获得使用新式农具的知识。
