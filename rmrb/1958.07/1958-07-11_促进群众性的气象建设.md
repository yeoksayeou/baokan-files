Promote Mass-Based Meteorological Development
By Our Staff Commentator

The great leap forward situation in national industry and agriculture has brought about a high tide in the leap forward of meteorological work; the mass-based technical revolution movement has also promoted the inventions and creations of meteorological workers. The desire of the broad masses, especially the peasant masses, to master meteorological science and technology as soon as possible to serve production, forces meteorological workers to further explore the direction and route of meteorological work. It is entirely necessary for the Third National Meteorological Conference held in Guilin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to focus on studying and solving this problem.

Meteorological work must rely on the entire Party and all the people. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no socialist meteorological work; only under the leadership of Party committees at all levels can meteorological work have a clear direction, the support of the masses, and promote the rapid development of meteorological work. The practice of the First Five-Year Plan and the achievements of meteorological work in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region convincingly demonstrate that the leadership of meteorological work should be delegated to the provinces, and the leadership of meteorological (weather) stations should be further delegated to the special districts and counties, while weather outposts should be established, managed, and used entirely by the townships themselves, following the principle of voluntariness. Overemphasizing the characteristics of meteorological work being centralized and technical, and advocating that everything should be grasped by the central authorities from top to bottom, is in essence a concrete reflection of the bourgeois ideology of not trusting the Party and not trusting the masses.

Over thousands of years, the Chinese people have accumulated rich meteorological and climatic knowledge from their experiences in production and daily life. Meteorological (weather) stations in various places have also mastered the laws of local weather changes to a certain extent after several years of arduous exploration. Taking the mass line, combining the scientific research of senior technical personnel with the inventions and creations of the broad masses, and combining foreign technology with mass experience, is the fundamental route to improve meteorological technology. We must tap the potential of all meteorological workers and local resources, and also tap the potential of various industrial sectors.

The service objects of meteorological work are multifaceted. The training and combat operations of modern armies require the coordination of meteorological work. Airplanes cannot take off and land without weather forecasts. The design of industrial and mining enterprises and farms requires meteorological data. Fishermen need to listen to weather broadcasts before going to sea. Transportation, water conservancy construction, salt production, forest fire prevention, livestock grazing, and the daily life of the broad masses of people all require the close cooperation of meteorological work. The task of all meteorological workers is to make their utmost efforts to meet the growing needs of all sectors, especially those sectors that have very urgent requirements for meteorology. However, agriculture, with the widest area, the largest population, and the most urgent requirements for meteorology, is the service focus of the entire meteorological work. While agriculture is making a great leap forward, meteorological workers should assist all sectors in avoiding the harm of disastrous weather and maximizing the utilization of meteorological resources to cooperate with all sectors in building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Under the current technical conditions, although there is still a process to eliminate the harm of disastrous weather and control the weather artificially, it is entirely possible to master the laws of weather changes to reduce disasters and increase production. The problem is to have the correct direction, soaring enthusiasm, and effective measures.

China's meteorological work, like other undertakings, should have a spirit and style of originality. The achievements of supplementary single-station forecasts by meteorological stations and climatological stations in Yunnan Province and some other provinces are the first good news of the original spirit of China's meteorological work. Meteorological (weather) stations in all countries of the world can only observe the weather and not transmit or supplement weather forecasts, but our stations supplement the forecasts of meteorological observatories based on their own observation experience and the actual experience of the masses, increasing the accuracy of forecasts by about 10%. Among them, the average accuracy of forecasts supplemented by the Zhenxiong Station from January to May this year reached more than 90%, catching up with the international level. Supplementary forecasts by single stations are very important in our country, which has a vast area, complex terrain, and variable weather. It not only basically solves the difficulty that the accuracy of short-term forecasts is difficult to improve for a while, but also makes up for the weakness that forecast stations are difficult to take care of the weather characteristics of each small area; and it is more convenient to combine with local production. All meteorological (weather) stations and outposts should do this and further improve it.

To be original, we must break the sense of mystery and the idea that meteorological technology is unattainable, establish a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, create a set of meteorological theories and methods suitable for China's geographical and weather conditions, and be good at collecting, summarizing, and refining the experience of the masses. Meteorological stations and climatological stations should not only accumulate data, but also provide services to the outside world; not only provide data, but also provide forecasts. All forecasters, observers, and data personnel should go deep into production units, familiarize themselves with the characteristics of production, especially the characteristics of agricultural production. Our slogan is that there should be a station in every special district, a station in every county, a weather outpost in every township, and a weather observation group everywhere.

Party committees and people's committees at all levels need to further strengthen the leadership of meteorological work, grasp the direction of meteorological development, improve the ideological awareness of meteorological cadres, and help solve some difficulties that meteorological departments themselves cannot solve, so as to better serve production. All production units and meteorological departments should closely cooperate, support each other, and all meteorological workers should redouble their efforts to produce more accurate data, information, and weather forecasts to serve all sectors; in particular, it is hoped that more accurate medium- and long-term forecasts will be made quickly. With the efforts of all parties, we will improve the level of China's meteorological work and promote mass-based meteorological development.

    促进群众性的气象建设
    本报评论员
    全国工农业大跃进的形势，带来了气象事业的跃进高潮；群众性的技术革命运动也促进了气象工作人员的发明创造。广大群众尤其是农民群众要求尽快地掌握气象科学技术来为生产服务的这种愿望，迫使气象工作者有必要进一步地来探讨气象工作的方向和路线问题。在广西僮族自治区桂林市召开的第三次全国气象会议集中地研究和解决这个问题是完全必要的。
    气象事业必须依靠全党全民来办。没有党的领导，就没有社会主义的气象事业；气象事业只有在各级党的领导下，才会明确方向，才有群众拥护，才能促使气象事业的飞跃发展。第一个五年计划的实践以及广西僮族自治区气象事业的成就，令人信服地认识到气象事业的领导权，要下放到省，气象（候）台站的领导权更需要下放到专区、县，而气象哨则应当按照自愿的原则，完全由乡自行建立、管理、使用。过分强调气象工作集中性、技术性的特点，主张一切由中央来抓，一竿子插到底，实质上就是不相信党、不相信群众的资产阶级思想的具体反映。
    我国人民几千年来从生产和日常生活的体验中积累了丰富的气象、气候知识，各地的气象（候）台站，经过几年来的艰苦摸索，也已经一定程度地掌握了当地天气变化的规律。走群众路线，高级技术人员的科学研究与广大群众的发明创造相结合，外来技术与群众经验相结合，是提高气象技术的根本路线。我们要把全体气象工作人员及地方上的潜力发掘出来，而且要把各产业部门的潜力发掘出来。
    气象工作的服务对象是多方面的。近代化军队的训练作战，需要气象工作的配合。飞机的起飞降落，没有气象预报是不行的。工矿、农场的设计，要有气象资料。渔民出海捕鱼，要听气象广播。交通运输、水利建设、盐业生产、森林防火、牲畜放牧以及广大人民日常生活等等，无一不需气象工作的密切配合。全体气象工作者的任务，就是要以自己的最大努力，来满足各方面日益增长的需要，特别是那些对气象要求非常迫切的部门的需要。但地区最广，人口最多，对气象要求最迫切的，莫过于农业，为农业服务是整个气象工作的服务重点。在农业生产大跃进的同时，气象工作者要协助各方面避免灾害性天气的侵害，最大限度地利用气象资源，以配合各方面实现多快好省地建设社会主义。在目前的技术条件下，虽然消灭灾害性天气的侵害，用人工来控制天气，还要有一段过程；而掌握天气变化的规律来减轻灾害、增加生产则是完全可以办到的。问题是要有正确的方向，冲天的干劲，有效的措施。
    我国的气象事业有如其他事业一样，应该有独创的精神和风格。云南省和有些省的若干气象站和气候站的单站补充预告的成就，是我国气象事业独创精神的首次捷音。世界各国的气象（候）站都只能观测天气而不传递和补充预报天气，我们的站却对气象台的预报，根据本站的观测体验和群众的实际经验加以补充，使预报的准确率提高10％左右。其中镇雄站今年1到5月补充后的预报准确率平均竟达90％以上，赶上了国际水平。单站的补充预报，在我们这样一个地区广大、地形复杂，天气多变的国家里非常重要。它既基本解决了短期预报的准确率一时难以提高的困难，又弥补了预报台难以照顾各个小范围天气特点的弱点；而且更便于和当地生产结合。所有的气象（候）站、哨都应当这样做并进一步加以提高。
    要独创就要打破对气象技术的神秘感和高不可攀的思想，树立起敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，创造出一套适合我国地理和天气条件的气象理论和方法，并善于汇集、总结提炼群众的经验。气象站、气候站不仅要积累资料，而且要对外服务；不仅供给资料，而且要供给预报。所有的预报员、观测员、资料员都要深入生产单位，熟悉生产特点，尤其是农业生产的特点。我们的口号是专区有台、县县有站、乡乡有哨、处处有看天小组。
    各级党委和人民委员会需要进一步加强气象工作的领导，掌握气象建设的方向，提高气象干部的思想意识，帮助解决某些气象部门本身所无法解决的困难，以便更好地为生产服务。各生产单位同气象部门应该密切协作，相互支持，全体气象工作人员要加倍努力，拿出更准确的资料、情报和气象预报，为各方面服务；尤其希望迅速作出比较正确的中、长期预告来。在各方面的努力下，来提高我国气象事业的水平，促进群众性的气象建设。
