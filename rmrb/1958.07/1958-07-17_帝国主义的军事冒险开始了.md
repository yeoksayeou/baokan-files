Imperialist Military Adventures Begin
By our reporter Pan Fei

Following the invasion of Lebanon by the United States Marine Corps, British troops are also standing by for action. Imperialism's military adventure in the Middle East has begun.

The revolutionary victory of the Iraqi people struck Washington and London like a magnitude nine typhoon. For Britain, the blow it suffered in this storm was very heavy. Britain holds 23.75% of the shares of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and through the Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Company, it indirectly controls another 23.75% of the shares. The incessant flow of oil from Iraqi soil has brought unbelievable super-profits to British monopoly groups. The Faisal dynasty and the Said government in Iraq were painstakingly cultivated by Britain over a long period and became Britain's and the Western colonial countries' most obedient agents in the Middle East (Faisal II studied in Britain, and Said was known as Britain's "most satisfactory" "forty-year-old friend," and in recent years, he visited Britain every year under the pretext of "medical treatment"). Therefore, "The Times" viewed pro-imperialist Iraq in this way: in addition to supplying Britain with a large amount of oil (which means a large amount of profit), it was also an important "pillar" of Britain in the Persian Gulf. This newspaper concluded that the Iraqi revolution not only meant the disillusionment of the Baghdad military bloc, which Britain had painstakingly built, but would also shake Britain's entire colonial rule in the Middle East.

The shock and anxiety of the British ruling group are self-evident. The British Cabinet emergency meeting started at 5 pm on the 14th and lasted until midnight. This was the longest cabinet meeting in Britain since the war. On the morning of the 15th, the meeting in Downing Street continued, and Macmillan summoned the heads of the three services. It was at this meeting that Britain decided to join the United States in carrying out armed intervention in Lebanon and Iraq. When the United States troops landed in Lebanon, the troops concentrated by Britain in Cyprus, Malta, and Bahrain were ready to move; the British troops in the homeland were in a state of combat readiness. On the 16th, London newspapers widely revealed Britain's adventurous plan: at Hussein's "request," British troops would enter Jordan, thereby cooperating with the American troops invading Lebanon to encircle Iraq.

It seems that Britain has forgotten the lesson of two years ago—the Suez War—and is preparing to launch a "second Suez." The difference is that in the previous one, Britain did it behind the back of the United States, and this time it is doing it in partnership with the United States. However, when dealing with the national liberation movement in the Middle East, even if imperialism takes joint action, the conflicts of interest between them cannot be concealed. Britain is worried that after this invasion, the United States will replace Britain's position on the coast of the Persian Gulf. The "News Chronicle" revealed that the US military invaded Lebanon, and the British army entered Jordan, because the British army was "more easily accepted by Jordan" than the US army, and this division of labor could avoid disputes over command and troop deployment. And when the United States and Britain took joint action in the Middle East, France, which was left aside, expressed great dissatisfaction. French Minister of Propaganda Soustelle complained that the United States only notified Paris of its actions before the troops were about to land in Lebanon. The imperialists seem to still be reliving the old dreams of a hundred years ago: drawing a line on the map with a pencil, dividing up colonies and spheres of influence. However, dreams are only activities of the cerebral cortex after all; reality is much more complicated than this. The current situation is not very wonderful for the invaders. Britain's "Daily Mail" called July 14th Britain's "darkest day." Correctly speaking, it is not just "one day"; the second half of the twentieth century will be the darkest years for imperialism!

    帝国主义的军事冒险开始了
    本报记者　潘非
    在美国海军陆战队侵入黎巴嫩之后，英国军队也正在待命行动。帝国主义在中东的军事冒险开始了。
    伊拉克人民的革命胜利，使华盛顿和伦敦遭受了一次九级台风。对英国来说，它在这次风暴中所遭受到的打击是很沉重的。英国掌握着伊拉克石油公司股票的23.75％，通过英荷石油公司，它又间接地掌握了这个公司的另一23.75％的股票。在伊拉克土地上滔滔不绝喷流出来的石油，为英国垄断集团带来了令人难以置信的超额利润。伊拉克的费萨尔王朝和赛义德政府，是英国长期苦心培植起来的，他们成为英国和西方殖民国家在中东最顺从的代理人（费萨尔二世曾在英国上学，赛义德被称为英国“最称心”的“四十年的老朋友”，近几年来，他以“治病”为理由，每年访问英国一次）。因而，“泰晤士报”是这样看待亲帝国主义的伊拉克的：它除了供应英国以大量的石油（也就是大量的利润）以外，还是英国在波斯湾的重要“支柱”。这家报纸得出的结论是：伊拉克的革命，不仅意味着英国苦心经营的巴格达军事集团的幻灭，而且将动摇英国在中东的整个殖民统治。
    英国统治集团的震惊和不安，是不言而喻的。英国内阁紧急会议从14日下午五点开起，一直持续到午夜。这是战后以来英国内阁最长的一次会议。15日上午，唐宁街的会议继续进行，麦克米伦并召见了三军首脑。就在这次会议上，英国决定伙同美国，对黎巴嫩和伊拉克进行武装干涉。当美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆的时候，英国集中在塞浦路斯、马耳他和巴林岛的部队，正蠢蠢欲动；英国本土的军队，已处于备战状态。16日伦敦各报已广泛地透露出英国的冒险计划：在侯赛因的“请求”下，英军将开入约旦，从而与侵入黎巴嫩的美军配合，钳击伊拉克。
    看来，英国已忘记了两年前的教训——苏伊士战争，而准备发动“第二个苏伊士”。所不同的是，在前一次，英国是背着美国干的，这一次是伙同美国干的。但是，在对付中东的民族解放运动时，即使帝国主义采取共同行动，它们之间的利害冲突，仍然是无法掩盖的。英国正担心着在这次侵略活动后，美国将取代英国在波斯湾畔的地位。“新闻纪事报”透露说：美军侵略黎巴嫩，英军开入约旦，是因为英国军队比美国军队“更容易被约旦所接受”，并且这种分工可以避免指挥上和兵力分配上的口角。而当美英在中东联合行动时，被撇在一边的法国表示了极大的不满。法国宣传部长苏斯戴尔埋怨：美国只是在军队将要在黎巴嫩登陆之前，才把它的行动通知巴黎。帝国主义者似乎仍然都在重温百年前的旧梦：把铅笔在地图上一划，瓜分殖民地和势力范围。但是，梦想毕竟只是大脑皮层的活动；现实，却比这复杂得多。目前的形势，对于侵略者来说，是并不十分美妙的。英国的“每日邮报”把7月14日称为英国“最黑暗的一天”。正确地说，决不仅只“一天”；二十世纪的下半叶，都将是帝国主义最黑暗的岁月！　（7月16日伦敦电）
