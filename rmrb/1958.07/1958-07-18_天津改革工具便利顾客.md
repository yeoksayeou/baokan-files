    Tianjin Reforms Tools to Benefit Customers

    (Our dispatch from Tianjin, July 16) The Tianjin Municipal Finance and Trade system is carrying out a mass technical innovation movement.

    The first goal of the technical innovation movement is to reform tools and liberate workers from heavy physical labor. Employees of the grain departments have created more than ten kinds of machinery, such as automatic electric scales, soil grain cleaning machines, grain sweepers, flour sack sweeping machines, and electric loading, unloading, and stacking machines. The electric loading, unloading, and stacking machine not only eliminates occupational diseases for porters but also stacks higher. Employees of the Junliangcheng warehouse spent only eight yuan to manufacture a sack-beating machine equipped with a dust suction pipe. Operated by five people, it can sweep ten thousand sacks a day, more than twice the efficiency of manual sweeping.

    The second goal is to benefit customers. The catering industry has created electric dough mixing machines and fried dough twist machines; the non-staple food industry has successfully trial-produced electric automatic metering devices for selling liquid commodities such as oil, wine, and vinegar; grain retail stores have created more than ten kinds of new tools, such as electric grain vending machines, grain price calculators, and rotating coarse grain boxes. The electric grain vending machine has an electrically operated weight controller. Above it is an index dial. Simply set the pointer on the index dial according to the quantity the customer wants to buy, press the button, and the gate at the bottom of the large grain box will automatically open, allowing the required amount of grain to flow out, taking less than a minute. The grain price calculator has a drum inside, wrapped with pre-calculated prices for more than ten kinds of grain, from one jin to fifty jin. After the customer buys grain, the salesperson only needs to crank the calculator to calculate the price, which is not only accurate but also reduces the time by half.

    天津改革工具便利顾客
    本报天津16日电　天津市财贸系统开展群众性技术革新运动。
    技术革新运动的第一个目标是：改革工具，使职工从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。粮食部门的职工创造出自动电磅土粮清理机、扫粮器、扫面袋机、电力装卸码垛两用机等十多种机械。电力装卸码垛两用机不但使搬运工人消除职业病，而且码得高。军粮城仓库的职工只花八元就制造了一台打麻袋机，上面装有吸尘管，用五个人操作，每天可以打扫万条麻袋，比人工打扫效率高二倍多。
    第二个目标是：便利顾客。饮食行业创造了电动合面机、炸果子机；副食品行业试制成功出售油、酒、醋等液体商品使用的电力自动计量器等；粮食零售店创造了电动售粮机、售粮价格计算机、转动售杂粮箱等十多种新工具。电动售粮器有一个用电操纵重量的斤数控制器，它的上面有指数盘，只要将指数盘上的指针按顾客购买的数量拨好，一按电钮，盛粮大木箱下端的闸板就会自动开开，流出顾客所需要的粮食来，用不了一分钟。售粮价格计算机里面有一个滚筒，上面缠有十几种粮食由一斤到五十斤已计算好的价格，顾客买粮后售货员只要一摇计算机就可算出价钱，不但准确，而且时间可缩短一半。
