Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 4th. The first session of the Second People's Congress of Sichuan Province concluded on the afternoon of July 2nd, lasting seven days. Seven hundred and thirty-seven representatives from all nationalities and social strata, including Han, Tibetan, Qiang, Yi, and Miao, attended the meeting.

    Li Dazhang, Governor of Sichuan Province, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee. He pointed out that the province's industrial and agricultural production is now entering a stage of rapid development. According to statistics from January to May this year, the total output value of local industries in the province increased by 26.57% compared with the same period last year. The output of most major products has increased significantly compared with the same period last year, such as pig iron, up 37.06%; coal, up 37.04%; and power generation, up 21.5%. Due to the implementation of the general line for socialist construction and the promotion of the spirit of the whole Party and the entire people running industry, the province's industrial production has been powerfully pushed to an unprecedented new peak. In terms of agricultural production, since last winter, the province has completed an additional 11.27 million mu of irrigated paddy fields, exceeding the total irrigated area of all water conservancy projects before liberation; the preliminary controlled area for soil and water conservation is 22.88 million mu, which is 4.6 times the amount completed in the previous two years. This has basically ensured the early transplanting of early rice and a large-scale bumper harvest of many spring crops, resulting in a bumper harvest of spring crops this year with an increase of more than 15% compared to last year. The report also mentioned the achievements made in transportation, postal services, commerce, culture, education, and health work throughout the province, as well as the democratic reforms in the Tibetan and Yi areas of Sichuan Province.

    The report proposed that the primary tasks for Sichuan Province in the current period and this winter and next spring are: to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule and to strive to make the total output value of local industry exceed the total output value of agriculture in the shortest possible time, and to carry out all work centering on this. The specific requirements are: to concentrate major efforts to accelerate the development of key industries, striving to increase the production capacity of steelmaking and ironmaking to 1.4 million tons and 2 million tons respectively in a short period; to vigorously develop machinery manufacturing and the power industry, while relying on the strength of all levels and departments to develop the chemical industry, the coal industry, and light industry; to ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production plan and strive for a grain increase of more than 15 billion jin; and to develop transportation and commerce accordingly. The report also specifically mentioned the unfolding of the technical revolution and the cultural revolution.

    When examining and discussing the government's work, the representatives expressed great satisfaction with the brilliant achievements made in various construction undertakings in Sichuan Province over the past year. The representatives carefully studied the tasks for this winter and next spring mentioned in the report, unanimously expressed their approval, and stated that they would work with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm to achieve even greater achievements in socialist construction. The meeting finally made corresponding resolutions on Governor Li Dazhang's report and other reports submitted to the meeting for discussion.
