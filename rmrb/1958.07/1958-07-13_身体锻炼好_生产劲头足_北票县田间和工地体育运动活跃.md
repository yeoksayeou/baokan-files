Good Physical Fitness, Sufficient Production Enthusiasm
Beipiao County's Sports Activities are Lively in the Fields and Construction Sites

(Reported by our newspaper) Rural sports are active in Beipiao County, Liaoning Province. All thirty-two townships, thirty-six communes, and one thousand one hundred production teams in the county established sports association organizations in just two weeks in April, and various sports activities quickly unfolded.

Beipiao County is a remote mountainous area with a very poor foundation for sports. Since the Great Leap Forward, approximately 50% of the county's total population, over 200,000 people, have participated in sports association organizations. The number of sports teams and exercise groups for various activities has also increased to more than four thousand nine hundred, more than seventeen times the past number. As many as thirty-six types of activities are being carried out, and calisthenics have been fully implemented from townships and communes down to production teams and groups. In order to widely carry out small-scale competitions, a county-wide "See Who Runs Fast, Jumps High, and Throws Far" Youth Cup correspondence competition was also held. In many sports activities, not only are all young and middle-aged people actively taking the lead in participating, but also the elderly and children have been swept into the upsurge of physical exercise. Diverse sports activities are not only displayed on the sports field, but have also spread to the fields, the land, and the construction sites. In the past, the Longtan Production Team of Yushudixa Township did not have any sports activities, and its production performance was backward, and it was rated as a third-class commune. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line, the masses' consciousness has been greatly improved. All the men and women, young and old in the whole commune are actively participating in physical exercise. Their physical fitness has been strengthened, and their production enthusiasm has risen sharply. After working hard for sixty days, they have leaped to become an advanced first-class commune, and the mental outlook of the people has also greatly changed. The Great Leap Forward in sports has brought an unprecedentedly active new atmosphere to the mountainous area.

The reason why Beipiao County has achieved such achievements is mainly because they have done the following: put politics in command and twisted production and sports into one rope; deepened ideological work and combined popularization and improvement; and leaders take the lead and rely on the masses.

The Liaoning Provincial Sports Commission and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly held a rural sports work on-site conference in Beipiao from June 15th to 17th, summarized Beipiao's experience, and prepared to promote it throughout the province.

The State Sports Commission has decided to hold a national rural sports work on-site conference in Beipiao in early August to exchange experiences in rural sports work.

    身体锻炼好　生产劲头足
    北票县田间和工地体育运动活跃
    本报讯　辽宁省北票县农村体育活跃，全县三十二个乡、三十六个社、一千一百个生产队，在4月份仅以两周的时间全部建立起体育协会组织，各项体育运动很快地开展起来。
    北票县是一个偏僻的山区，体育运动基础很差，自从大跃进以来，约占全县总人口50％的二十多万人参加了体协组织，各种项目的体育运动队和锻炼小组也发展到四千九百多个，比过去增长了十七倍还多。开展的项目多达三十六种，广播体操从乡社直到生产队组已经全面铺开。为了广泛开展小型竞赛，还举行了全县规模的“看谁跑得快，跳得高，投得远”的青年杯通讯比赛。在许多体育活动中，不仅所有的青壮年积极带头参加，老人和儿童也卷入了锻炼身体的热潮。多种多样的体育活动不仅展现在运动场上，而且已经遍及田间、地头和工地。榆树底下乡龙潭生产社过去没有什么体育活动，生产成绩落后，被评为三类社。在总路线的光辉照耀下，群众觉悟大大提高，全社男女老少都积极参加体育锻炼，体质增强了，生产劲头日高三丈，在大干了六十天，一跃而为先进的一类社，人们的精神面貌也大为改观。体育运动的大跃进，给山区带来了空前活跃的新气象。
    北票县所以取得这样成绩，主要是他们做到了：政治挂帅，把生产和体育拧成一根绳；思想工作搞得深透，普及和提高并举；领导带头、依靠群众。
    辽宁省体育运动委员会和共青团省委于6月15至17日在北票联合召开的农村体育工作现场会议，总结了北票的经验，准备在全省推广。
    国家体委确定于8月初旬在北票召开全国农村体育工作现场会议，交流农村体育工作经验。
