Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 4th. Thousands of peasants in Panxi, Yunnan, built the Panjiang Bridge with their own hands, without engineers or mechanical equipment. On the 1st, local farmers held a traffic opening ceremony, celebrating their labor achievements.

This steel girder bridge has a span of 50 meters, and the bridge piers are nearly 15 meters high above the water surface.

The Nanpan River is one of the major rivers in Yunnan Province. When it flows through the Panxi District of Huaning County, the riverbed is as wide as 88 meters, and the water flow is turbulent. Ten townships on one side of the river, which are rich in sugarcane, have to detour about 200 kilometers to transport sugarcane to the sugar factory on the other side of the river, which consumes a lot of labor every year.

This bridge was built by the farmers after breaking superstitions. In February of this year, when the Huaning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to build a bridge, two groups of engineers came to the site for surveying, but they were scared away by the rapid water, shifting sand and difficult engineering. However, Pan Jianzhou, the county party secretary, was neither intimidated by the engineers nor frightened by the technical difficulties of the project. He and thousands of farmers and more than 20 stonemasons went into battle with drive and determination, determined to build the bridge with their own hands. They learned while doing, many farmers stayed up for several days and nights, braving torrential rain and bone-chilling cold winds, working day and night. They successfully completed the water enclosure project by using methods such as filling the core of the dam with sand and soil, using straw mats instead of sacks, and pasting mud on the dam embankment. Then, they overcame the difficulties of lacking bridge-building machinery and equipment, using earth centipede carts to pull steel beams, using cart axles as pulleys, and using hands instead of cranes, and finally erected the 28 steel beams, each weighing one ton, onto the bridge piers. After more than four months of hard work, a miracle was created. Moreover, this bridge only cost 81,000 yuan, while the original plan was to spend 700,000 yuan.

### 南盘江急水流沙吓跑了工程师  架桥梁技术困难难不住有心人  华宁农民建起钢梁大桥

    南盘江急水流沙吓跑了工程师
    架桥梁技术困难难不住有心人
    华宁农民建起钢梁大桥
    新华社昆明4日电　云南盘溪地方上千农民，在没有工程师和机械设备的条件下，用自己的双手筑起了盘江大桥。1日，当地农民举行通车式，欢庆自己的劳动成就。
    这座钢梁大桥，跨径达五十公尺，桥墩高离水面近十五公尺。
    南盘江是云南省主要河流之一。流经华宁县盘溪区时，河床宽达八十八公尺，水流湍急。江一边盛产甘蔗的十个乡，运输甘蔗到江另一边的糖厂，要绕道二百公里左右，历年都耗费很多劳动力。
    这座大桥是农民打破迷信后建成的。今年2月，当中共华宁县委提出要修大桥，先后有两批工程师曾到现场踏勘，他们看到急水、流沙和工程艰巨，都被吓跑了。但是，县委书记潘建州既没有被工程师唬住，也没有被工程技术上的困难吓倒，他和上千农民和二十多个石匠，凭干劲和钻劲上阵，决心用双手修成大桥。他们边做边学，许多农民几天几夜不合眼，冒倾盆大雨和透骨冷风，夜以继日地干。他们采用坝心填沙土、草席代麻袋、浆泥糊坝埂等办法，顺利地完成围水工程。接着，他们又克服缺乏架桥机械设备的困难，采用土蜈蚣车拉钢梁，马车轴心当滑轮，用手代替起重机等办法，终于把二十八根每根重一吨的钢梁，一一架上桥墩。四个多月的苦战，创造了奇迹。而且这座大桥只用了八万一千元，原计划是要花七十万元。
