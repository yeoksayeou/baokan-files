Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 25th: The key project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway—the Tianshan Tunnel Group project—has entered a stage of intense, comprehensive construction. In the ten-kilometer mountainous area, power lines, telephone lines, and aerial transport lines are strung across the hillsides. The roar of rock drills and the booming of explosions shake the valley all day long. On the transport lines crisscrossed by highways, paths, and light railways, vehicles of all sizes shuttle back and forth. The construction site is brightly lit all night long. More than three thousand railway construction workers have put forward the fighting slogan of "Hard work for one year, trains will pass through the Tianshan Mountains," and launched a full-scale attack on the Tianshan Mountains. The first phase of seven tunnel projects has all started.

The Tianshan Tunnel Group is located more than eighty kilometers east of Urumqi, tightly controlling the transportation passage between the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In the ten-kilometer stretch of towering mountains and steep ridges, twelve tunnels with a total length of four and a half kilometers need to be built. Among them, Tunnel No. 11 is 1,200 meters long, which is 200 meters longer than the Wuqiaoling Tunnel. It requires transporting 100,000 cubic meters of building materials such as cement, gravel, and rubble to the mountainside. Between the tunnels, many hilltops need to be leveled, and dozens of deep gullies need to be filled. On average, every kilometer requires deep excavation and high filling of 200,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, making the project very arduous.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 25th: The new construction project of the Duyun to Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, extending between Guangxi and Guizhou, is progressing very rapidly. At present, most of the thirty-two tunnels on this line have been opened, and the walls are being built and arches erected; the main structures of sixteen of the twenty-four large and medium-sized bridges with a total length of two thousand three hundred meters have been completed, and the remaining eight bridges are also nearing completion and will soon be finished; 65% of the earth and stone works of the line have been completed, and sections of straight roadbeds have been laid among the mountains.

    兰新路职工大战天山隧道群
    黔桂铁路都筑段隧道大部打通
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　兰新铁路的关键工程——天山隧道群工程，已经进入紧张的全面施工阶段。在十公里山岳地区，输电线、电话线、高空运输线架满了山坡。开山机的轰鸣声和隆隆的爆破声，整日震撼着山谷。在公路、便道和轻便铁路纵横交织的运输线上，各种大小车辆穿梭般奔驰。工地上彻夜灯火辉煌，三千多名筑路工人提出“苦战一年，火车过天山”的奋战口号，向天山发动了全面进攻。第一期七条隧道工程已全部开工。
    天山隧道群在乌鲁木齐以东八十多公里处，紧扼着天山南北的交通孔道。在十公里的崇山峻岭间，要打通总长四公里半的十二条隧道，其中十一号隧道全长一千二百公尺，比乌鞘岭大隧道还长二百公尺。光是要运上半山腰处的水泥、砂石、片石等建筑材料，就有十万方。隧道之间还要削平许多山头，填起几十道深沟，平均每一公里就要深挖高填土石方二十万方，工程非常艰巨。
    据新华社贵阳25日电　伸展在广西和贵州之间的黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳段的新建工程进展十分迅速。目前，这条线路上的三十二座隧道，大部分已先后打通，正在砌墙起拱；总长二千三百多公尺长的二十四座大中桥梁，有十六座的主体工程已经完成，剩余的八座桥梁也接近收尾，不久就可完工；线路土石方工程已完成65％，一段段平直的路基在群山间铺好了。（附图片）
