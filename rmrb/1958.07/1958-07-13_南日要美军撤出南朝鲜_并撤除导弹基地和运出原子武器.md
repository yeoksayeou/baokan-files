Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12th: Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement today condemning the blatant aggressive acts of the U.S. imperialists in establishing missile bases in South Korea recently, and strongly demanded that the United States remove the missile bases established in South Korea, remove atomic weapons and other new weapons, and immediately withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea.

The statement said that despite repeated warnings from the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, U.S. warmongers, after moving the "United Nations Command" and the U.S. First Cavalry Division from Japan to South Korea, reorganizing the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions, and illegally transporting atomic cannons and "Honest John" rockets into South Korea, formally established the U.S. "Fourth Missile Command" near Chuncheon, south of the military demarcation line, on July 4, frantically establishing missile bases.

The statement said that in order to guide the Korean armistice towards a consolidated peace and seek the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in its statement issued on February 5 this year, proposed a plan for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea. The People's Republic of China supports this initiative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and has taken proactive measures to withdraw all Chinese People's Volunteers from northern Korea by the end of this year. The first phase of the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers has been completed, and the second phase of the withdrawal is currently underway. The proactive measures taken by the DPRK and China have opened up a new situation for maintaining peace in Korea and promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. troops occupying South Korea are not only failing to follow the example of the Chinese People's Volunteers and immediately withdraw from South Korea, but are instead establishing missile bases aimed at mass slaughter of residents.

The statement said that the peace-threatening behavior of the U.S. aggressors is encouraging the Syngman Rhee clique to create war provocations and exacerbate tensions in Korea. The U.S. military's occupation of South Korea and various overt provocative acts such as the establishment of missile bases not only seriously violate the Korean Armistice Agreement, but also hinder the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and threaten peace in Korea and the Far East. Therefore, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea is a prerequisite for maintaining peace in Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

The statement emphasized that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resolutely condemns the U.S. aggressors for implementing this adventurous war policy in South Korea. If the U.S. government continues to establish missile bases in South Korea and refuses to withdraw its aggressive troops, then the U.S. government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    南日要美军撤出南朝鲜
    并撤除导弹基地和运出原子武器
    新华社平壤12日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天发表声明，谴责美帝国主义者最近在南朝鲜建立导弹基地的露骨的侵略行为，并且强硬要求美国撤除在南朝鲜设立的导弹基地，运出原子武器和其它新式武器，立即把美军从南朝鲜撤出。
    声明说，美国好战分子不顾朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的多次警告，在把“联合国军司令部”和美军第一骑兵师从日本移入南朝鲜，把驻在南朝鲜的美军改编为原子师，并且把原子炮和“诚实的约翰”式火箭非法运入南朝鲜以后，又在7月4日在军事分界线以南的春川附近正式成立了美军“第四导弹司令部”，猖狂地建立导弹基地。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为了把朝鲜停战导向巩固的和平和谋求祖国的和平统一，曾经在它于今年2月5日发表的声明中，提出了从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的方案。中华人民共和国支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的这一倡议，并且采取了主动的措施，要在今年年底以前从朝鲜北部全部撤出中国人民志愿军。中国人民志愿军的第一批撤军工作已经完成，第二批撤军目前正在进行。朝中方面采取的主动措施为维护朝鲜的和平、促进朝鲜问题的和平解决打开了新的局面。
    声明指出，侵占着南朝鲜的美军不但不仿效中国人民志愿军的做法，立即从南朝鲜撤出，反而在建立以大量屠杀居民为目的的导弹基地。
    声明说，美国侵略者这种威胁和平的行为鼓舞着李承晚集团制造战争挑衅，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。美军的强占南朝鲜和建立导弹基地等各种公开的挑衅行为不仅严重地违反了朝鲜停战协定，而且阻挠着朝鲜问题的和平解决和威胁着朝鲜和远东的和平。因此，美军从南朝鲜撤出是维护朝鲜和平和和平解决朝鲜问题的首要条件。
    声明强调说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府坚决谴责美国侵略者在南朝鲜实行这种冒险性的战争政策。如果美国政府继续在南朝鲜建立导弹基地，拒绝撤出它的侵略军队，那么，美国政府应对由此而引起的一切后果担负完全的责任。
