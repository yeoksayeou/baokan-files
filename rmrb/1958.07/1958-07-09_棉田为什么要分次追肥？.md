Currently, cotton plants are budding. From the budding stage to flowering and boll formation is the period of most rapid growth for cotton. During this time, maintaining vigorous growth of the cotton plants and the formation of a large number of buds and bolls requires the supply of a large amount of nutrients. According to experiments, the nutrients needed during this period account for about 60% of the total requirement. If the nutrients are insufficient, the cotton plants will grow weakly, develop slowly, and produce fewer buds and bolls, with more shedding. To promote vigorous cotton growth and more bud and boll formation, in addition to applying base fertilizer, topdressing during the growing season is extremely important.

The best method for applying topdressing is "a slow trickle, many small meals," meaning that the number of topdressing applications should be increased, while the amount applied each time should not be too much. By doing so, the cotton can absorb the required nutrients multiple times, and the fertilizer will not be lost due to excessive application at once. Supplying a certain amount of fertilizer at any time according to the needs of cotton growth can also avoid excessive growth and delayed maturity caused by excessive rainfall.

The number of topdressing applications can generally be divided into: applications after seedling setting, at the budding stage, at the flowering stage, and at the initial boll formation stage. For high-yield cotton fields and cotton fields in areas with longer growing seasons, the number of topdressing applications can be increased.

The yield-increasing effect of split topdressing is very significant. In 1957, the Linqing Agricultural Experiment Station in Shandong Province, in cotton fields where 3,000 jin of manure, 60 jin of cottonseed cake, and 30 jin of superphosphate were applied as base fertilizer, applying 25 jin of ammonium sulfate once at the budding stage increased production by 11.5% compared to not applying topdressing; applying the 25 jin of ammonium sulfate in three applications after seedling setting, at the budding stage, and at the flowering stage increased production by 14.76% compared to not applying topdressing.

The nutrients required by cotton are mainly absorbed by the roots. Nutrients must be dissolved in water for the roots to absorb them. Thus, topdressing should be applied to the soil and gradually deepened as the cotton roots penetrate deeper. The best methods for layered deep application are trench application or hole application.

The nutrients required for cotton growth and development mainly include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen is the main substance for forming all parts of the cotton plant; phosphorus can develop roots and enrich fruits; potassium can improve the growth function of cotton plants and enhance disease resistance. Cotton has different needs for these three nutrients at different stages of growth. Nitrogen is needed more before and during the flowering stage; the demand for phosphorus increases during the flowering and boll formation stage. Therefore, in topdressing, these three nutrients should be applied in combination, and they should be applied before the crop needs them to achieve better results.

### 棉田为什么要分次追肥？

    棉田为什么要分次追肥？
    目前棉花已经现蕾，从现蕾起，到开花结铃是棉花生育最迅速的时期。在这期间，维护棉株生长旺盛，形成大量蕾铃，就需要供给它大量养料。据试验，这时期所需要的养料约占总需要量的60％以；如果养料不足，棉株生长瘦弱，发育迟缓，蕾铃结的少，脱落的多。促使棉花生育旺盛，多结蕾铃，除施用基肥外，在生育期的追肥极关重要。
    施用追肥的最好方法是“细水长流、少吃多餐”，也就是追肥的次数要多，每次施用量则不要太多。这样做，棉花能够多次吸取到所需要的养料，肥料也不会因一次追施过多而造成流失；按照棉花生长需要，随时供应一定数量的肥料，还可以避免因雨水过多所引起的徒长晚熟。
    追肥的次数，一般可分为：在定苗后，现蕾期，开花期和结铃初期施下。高额丰产棉田和生长季节较长地区的棉田，追肥次数还可增多。
    分期追肥的增产效果是很显著的。1957年山东临清农业试验站，在同样施用圈粪三千斤、棉仁饼六十斤，过磷酸钙三十斤做基肥的棉田中，用硫酸铵二十五斤在现蕾期一次施下的，比不施追肥的增产11.5％；把二十五斤硫酸铵在定苗后、现蕾期、开花期，分三次施下的，比不施追肥的增产14.76％。
    棉花所需要的养料，主要由根部吸取；养料又必须溶解在水分中，根部才能吸取。这样，追肥就要施在土壤中，并随着棉花根系深入逐次加深。分层深施的办法，以开沟施或穴施两种最好。
    棉花生长发育所需要的养料，主要是氮、磷、钾等三种养分。氮是形成棉花各个部分的主要物质；磷能发育根系充实果实；钾能增进棉株生长机能，增强抗病力。棉花在生育不同阶段，对这三种养料有不同的需要。在开花期前和开花期，需要氮素养料较多；开花结铃期，对磷素养料要求增多。因此在追肥当中，对这三种养分要配合施用，同时要在作物需要以前施下去，以发挥更好的效果。
