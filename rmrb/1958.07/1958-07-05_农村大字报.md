    Rural Big-Character Posters
    Leading the Way is the Party Branch Secretary
    Everyone come and see, everyone listen,
    Let's evaluate the cadres of the upstream agricultural cooperative;
    Our cooperative's cadres have great determination,
    Leading the way is the Party Branch Secretary.
    Branch Secretary Qin Zhaozhong,
    Implements resolutions like the wind;
    Exhausting every means and plan,
    His leadership has great merit.
    Comrade Zhaozhong manages the household well,
    Insisting on the collective, suppressing spontaneity;
    All private reclaimed land is taken back,
    There are ways to eliminate capitalism.
    (Guangxi Yishan County, Yueda Agricultural Cooperative)
    No Complacency
    The Eighth Team's production is top-notch,
    Everyone who sees it praises them.
    Early rice production was done well,
    But late rice preparation and fertilizer accumulation are poor.
    The main reason is complacency,
    They always say they are better than others.
    If you don't strive to be at the forefront,
    Future production will collapse.
  (Guangdong Huaiji County, Shidong Township, Liufu Cooperative)
    Don't Be Discouraged
    My name was mentioned on the big-character poster,
    Someone is really unhappy in their heart.
    He said, "Working hard on the job,
    Now I still have to be criticized,
    In the future, I won't care about anything,
    Let them criticize me."
    Let me advise you, comrade, don't be angry,
    Criticism is not to destroy you,
    If you can correct your shortcomings,
    Everyone will welcome you even more;
    Work hard in production, do your job well,
    Everyone will praise you.
  (Guangdong Yunfu County, Liaodong Township Agricultural Cooperative)
    Don't You Think It's Annoying?
    I am a treasure among treasures,
    My name is well-given,
    Everyone loves me,
    Having me is like having a treasure.
    Only the cooperative leaders,
    Treat me like manure,
    Rats come to eat me,
    Eat their fill and sing as they run away;
    Worms come to eat me,
    I really can't stand it.
    Let everyone evaluate,
    Don't you think it's annoying?
    (Guangxi Pingle County, Miaokou Agricultural Cooperative)

    农村大字报
    带头就是党支书
    大家来看大家听，
    上游干部大家评；
    我社干部决心大，
    带头就是党支书。
    支部书记覃肇忠，
    执行决议利如风；
    用尽千方和百计，
    领导工作有大功。
    肇忠同志当好家，
    坚持集体压自发；
    全部收回私人开荒地，
    消灭资本主义有办法。
    （广西宜山县?达农业社）
    自满不得
    八队生产顶呱呱，
    人人看见称赞他。
    早造生产做得好，
    可惜晚造备耕积肥差。
    主要原因是自满，
    经常都说胜人家。
    若不力争上游起，
    将来生产就会垮。
  （广东怀集县诗洞乡六福社）
    不要泄气
    大字报上点了名，
    有人心里实在不高兴。
    他说“辛辛苦苦搞工作，
    现在还要挨批评，
    以后百事我不理，
    任你将我去点名。”
    劝声同志莫生气，
    批评不是整垮你，
    有了缺点能改正，
    大家对你更欢迎；
    勤劳生产工作好，
    人人定会把你称。
  （广东云浮县料洞乡农业社）
    你说恼不恼？
    我是宝中宝，
    名字安得好，
    人人都爱我，
    得我如得宝。
    惟有社领导，
    待我如粪草，
    老鼠来吃我，
    吃饱唱着跑；
    虫儿来吃我，
    我真受不了。
    大家来评评，
    你说恼不恼？
    （广西平乐县妙口农业社）
