Main Business and "Sideline"
	Wu Lü

Recently, newspapers have published many news stories about industrial enterprises implementing diversified operations and developing "sideline production." Textile factories' repair workshops manufacture farm tools, match factories manufacture phosphate fertilizer, and many factories are smelting iron and steel. There are really too many to list. Yesterday, this newspaper published news about the Jiamusi Paper Mill running satellite factories producing cement, instruments, and alcohol on a large scale. Today, it published news about the Chongqing Zhongliangshan Coal Mine establishing seventy-five satellite factories for steel, aluminum smelting, machinery manufacturing, and carbon black within half a month. Satellite factories are a kind of "sideline" for the parent factory. However, there are many ways for factories and enterprises to develop "sideline production."

These situations show that the possibility of developing "sideline production" generally exists in industrial enterprises. At least three aspects of this possibility are now very clear. The first is the resource aspect. Many things in nature have multiple uses and can be comprehensively utilized. When a factory only produces one product, it can only utilize one aspect of it, often resulting in waste. Comprehensive utilization of resources and development of "sideline production" are imperative. There are also many "waste materials" that are actually very good things. The second is the equipment aspect. The same machine tool can process this part and that part. Therefore, the repair workshop of a textile factory can repair textile machinery and also engage in "sidelines" to manufacture farm tools, and a vehicle factory can manufacture locomotives and also engage in "sidelines" to manufacture locomobile boilers. The third is the most active productive force: people. Needless to say, people can master this production technology and also master that production technology.

Our country's construction and people's lives require a large number of various industrial products. Using the objective possibilities mentioned above to vigorously develop "sideline production," organize diversified operations, and provide more material wealth to society is an excellent thing. However, to turn possibility into reality requires subjective effort. In this regard, some comrades have not been very active in the past. They believe that "sideline production" is just "sideline production, if there is interest, a little can be done, otherwise, if it is put aside, what does it matter?"

To talk about dialectics, this is another example of not understanding dialectics. There is no waste material in the world, and there is no distinction between "main" and "sideline" in the world's industries. What is your "sideline" is his "main business," and both are needed by society. Raising fish is also a "sideline" for farmers, but it is the "main business" of fishermen. Phosphate fertilizer is a "sideline" in a match factory, but it is a "main business" in a phosphate fertilizer factory. It can be seen that as far as the whole society is concerned, as long as it is needed for social life, it is important.

Of course, due to the needs of the social division of labor, there is a distinction between "main business" and "sideline" for specific enterprises. This distinction is completely necessary. Anyone who cannot distinguish between "main" and "sideline" will reverse the importance of things in their work. "Sideline" should revolve around the main business, not hinder the main business, but help the main business. Only in this way can the "sideline" be better developed.

### 正业和“副业”

    正业和“副业”
    吴滤
    最近，报纸上登了许多工业企业实行多种经营、发展“副业生产”的新闻。纺织厂的修理车间制造农具，火柴厂里制造磷肥，许多工厂都炼铁炼钢，真是书不胜书。昨天，本报又发表了佳木斯造纸厂大办水泥、仪表、酒精等卫星工厂的新闻，今天还发表了重庆中梁山煤矿半个月内办起了钢铁、炼铝、机械制造、炭黑等七十五个卫星工厂的新闻。卫星工厂对母厂说来，是一种“副业”。可是，工厂企业发展“副业生产”的门路多得很。
    这些情况说明工业企业确实普遍存在着发展“副业生产”的可能性。这种可能性，至少有三个方面现在已经看得很清楚了。第一是资源方面。自然界有许多东西本来就有多种用途，可以综合利用，当一个工厂只生产一种产品的时候，只能利用它的一个方面，因而常常造成浪费。要综合利用资源，发展“副业生产”就势在必行。还有许多“废料”，其实也是很好的东西。第二是设备方面。同一种机床能加工这种零件，也能加工那种零件，因而纺织厂的修理车间能修理纺织机械，也能搞“副业”，制造农具，车辆厂能制造机车，也能搞“副业”，制造锅驼机。第三是生产力中最活跃的人。这不用说，人能掌握这种生产技术，也能掌握那种生产技术。
    我们国家的建设和人民的生活需要大量各种各样的工业产品。利用上面说的这些客观可能性，大搞“副业生产”，组织多种经营，为社会提供更多的物质财富，是一件极好的事情。然而，要把可能性变为现实，就需要人的主观努力，在这方面，过去有些同志看法并不是很积极的。他们认为“副业生产”不过是“副业生产而已，若有兴致，可以搞一点，否则，搁在一边，又有何妨？
    要说辩证法，这也是不懂辩证法之一例。世界上无废料，天下之业也无“正”“副”之分。你之“副业”，即是他之“正业”，都是社会所需要的。养鱼在农民也是“副业”，却又是渔民的“正业”。磷肥在火柴厂里是“副业”，在磷肥厂里却又是“正业”。可见就全社会而言，只要是社会生活需要的，都是重要的。
    当然，由于社会分工的需要，就具体企业来说，是有“正业”“副业”的区别的。这种区别是完全必要的。谁要分不清“正”“副”，在工作上就会轻重倒置。“副业”应该围绕正业、不妨碍正业，又帮助正业。也只有这样，“副业”才能更好地发展。
