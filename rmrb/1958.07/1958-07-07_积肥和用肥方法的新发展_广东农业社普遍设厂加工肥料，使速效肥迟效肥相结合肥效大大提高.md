    New Developments in Manure Accumulation and Fertilizer Application Methods
    Guangdong Agricultural Cooperatives Universally Establish Factories to Process Fertilizers, Combining Quick-Acting and Slow-Acting Fertilizers to Greatly Increase Fertilizer Effectiveness

    (Our report) Guangzhou - The shift in Guangdong Province from mass accumulation of farm manure and native miscellaneous fertilizers last winter and spring to the widespread establishment of fertilizer processing plants by agricultural cooperatives is a new creation and development in manure accumulation and fertilizer application methods. This not only closely integrates manure accumulation and fertilizer production on a regular basis, ensuring mass year-round manure accumulation, but more importantly, the processed fertilizer combines quick-acting and slow-acting fertilizers, greatly improving fertilizer quality and greatly increasing fertilizer effectiveness, allowing for better provision of nutrients according to the needs of crops. This experience has been widely promoted in Guangdong Province. As of April this year, more than 59,000 fertilizer processing plants had been established by agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, averaging one and a half per cooperative.

    In the past, Guangdong farmers relied on a portion of chemical fertilizers, along with farm manure and native miscellaneous fertilizers accumulated by the masses. However, chemical fertilizers are quick-acting fertilizers, whose main effect is to promote growth during the crop's growth period, and the fertilizer effect is not lasting, unable to constantly meet the needs of crops, and is also prone to loss. Farm manure and native miscellaneous fertilizers are mainly slow-acting, decompose slowly, and have the defect of not being able to supply the required nutrients in time when crops are growing rapidly. In the Great Leap Forward in production, the shortcomings and contradictions of these two types of fertilizers became even more prominent. The establishment of fertilizer processing plants by agricultural cooperatives can basically solve this problem.

    Fertilizers, after being mixed and formulated, achieve three combinations in terms of fertilizer effectiveness: the combination of various elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and organic matter; the combination of organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers; and the combination of quick-acting fertilizers and slow-acting fertilizers. In this way, the various shortcomings of using mineral fertilizers and organic fertilizers separately are overcome. Mineral fertilizers are mainly quick-acting fertilizers, easily soluble in water, and can be directly absorbed and utilized by plants, which is their advantage. However, they are also prone to directly interacting with the soil, changing their original properties. For example, ammonium sulfate runs to the soil surface when the weather is dry, and is easily lost in rainwater, making it difficult to stay where the root system has the strongest absorption power. Applying mineral fertilizers together with organic fertilizers can enable beneficial microorganisms to absorb the nutrients of soluble mineral fertilizers during the decomposition of organic matter, and then gradually release them for plant use, avoiding loss. At the same time, the defect that native miscellaneous fertilizers decompose very slowly and cannot rapidly supply nutrients when plants need them most is also changed. This is a great benefit after fertilizer factories process fertilizers.

    This experience was first created relatively comprehensively by the Longbang First Cooperative in Xinhui County. The cooperative's manure accumulation habits were originally very poor. It began to establish a fertilizer processing plant in 1956, and basically achieved self-sufficiency in fertilizer last year. The cooperative's application of processed fertilizers has had good results. In 1956, production teams that used more processed fertilizer in rice production all achieved increased production. In the forty-two mu of high-yield fields run by the cooperative, each mu was fertilized with 2,000 to 3,000 jin of mixed fertilizer, and as a result, the high-yield ones reached 1,230 jin, and the lowest was above 800 jin. Processed fertilizer is not only highly effective and able to increase production, but also reduces costs and saves labor (for example, 800 jin of refined pond mud fertilizer is equivalent to more than 100 dan of dry pond mud or 300 to 400 dan of wet pond mud, and the use of refined pond mud saves a lot of labor in transportation). Factory fertilizer quickly established faith among the masses. Even the Third Production Team, which was the least willing to use factory fertilizer, also requested the allocation of factory fertilizer.

    积肥和用肥方法的新发展
    广东农业社普遍设厂加工肥料，使速效肥迟效肥相结合肥效大大提高
    本报讯　去冬今春广东省由大量积集农家肥和土杂肥到普遍由农业社开设肥料加工厂制肥，是积肥和施肥方法上的新创造、新发展。这不仅使积肥和制肥经常地密切结合，保证了群众性的常年积肥，更重要的是经过加工后的肥料，使速效肥与迟效肥相结合，肥料质量大为改进，肥效大大提高，可以更好地根据作物的需要来供给养分。这个经验，已在广东省普遍推广。今年4月份，全省农业社已建立肥料加工厂五万九千多个，每社平均有一个半。
    过去广东农民，施肥依靠一部分化肥，加上群众积集的农家肥和土杂肥。但是化肥是速效性肥料，主要效果在作物生长期间促进生长，肥效不能持久，不能经常满足作物的需要，而且易于流失；而农家肥和土杂肥主要是迟效性的，分解慢，当作物迅速生长时又有不能及时供给所需养分的缺陷。在生产大跃进中，这两种肥料的缺点和矛盾更突出了，农业社开设肥料加工厂，混合配制肥料，可以基本解决这个问题。
    肥料经过混合配制，使肥效达到了三个结合：氮、磷、钾、钙、有机质等多种要素相结合；有机肥与无机肥相结合；速效肥和迟效肥相结合。这样，就克服了矿物质肥料与有机肥料单独施用的种种缺点。矿物质肥料主要是速效肥料，容易溶解于水，可以直接为植物所吸收利用，这是它的好处。但是，它也容易与土壤起直接的作用，改变它原来的性质。如硫酸铵天气干燥时跑到土壤表面，雨水中容易流失，不容易留在根群吸收力最强的地方。把矿物质肥料与有机肥料配合一起施用，就可以使有益的微生物在分解有机物质过程中吸收可溶性的矿物质肥料的养分，以后又逐渐解放出来供植物利用，而避免了流失。同时土杂肥分解很慢，不能在植物生长必需养分时迅速供给养分的缺点也改变了。这是制肥厂加工肥料后的大好处。
    这个经验首先由新会县龙榜一社较全面地创造出来的。这个社积肥习惯原来很差，1956年开始建立肥料加工厂，去年基本做到了肥料自给。该社施用加工肥料的效果良好。1956年水稻生产使用加工肥料较多的生产队都获得增产。全社举办的四十二亩丰产田，每亩下了混合肥二千到三千斤，结果高产的达一千二百三十斤，最低的也在八百斤以上。加工过的肥料不仅肥效大，能够增产，而且降低了成本，节省了劳力（如八百斤塘坭精肥效相当于一百多担干塘坭或三、四百担湿塘坭，使用塘坭精便节省大量人力来运送）。厂肥很快在群众中树立了信仰。最不愿用厂肥的第三生产队也要求拨配厂肥了。
