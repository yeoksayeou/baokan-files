    Undeterred by Wind and Rain
    Shao Yu
    Let the wind blow as it may,
    Let the rain fall as it may,
    Wind and rain make for a perfect day,
    Working one, achieving two;
    Red flags planted everywhere on the grassland,
    Globe amaranth flowers blooming all around.

    风雨无阻
    邵宇
    风尽管刮，
    雨尽管下，
    刮风下雨顶好天
    劳动一个当俩；
    草原处处插红旗
    遍地盛开马兰花。
