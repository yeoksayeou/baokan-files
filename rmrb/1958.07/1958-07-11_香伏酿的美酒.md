    Fragrant Rhizome Brewed into Fine Wine
    Recently, employees of the Yantai Distillery successfully brewed wine using a wild plant – the fragrant rhizome. They plan to brew 470,000 *jin* of 65-proof fragrant rhizome liquor in the second half of this year, which can save the state over 1 million *jin* of grain.

    The fragrant rhizome grass grows on mountains, field ridges, and among other weeds. Its roots have many nodules containing a large amount of starch, with a high alcohol yield of 45%. The wine made from fragrant rhizome grass is transparent in color, has a sweet and slightly fragrant taste, and is very palatable. Since fragrant rhizome is a medicinal material, the wine made from it also has the effect of strengthening the stomach and refreshing the mind.

    While using fragrant rhizome to make wine, the Yantai Distillery also distills 0.5% fragrant rhizome oil, which can be used to manufacture high-grade fragrances.

    香伏酿的美酒
    烟台酿酒厂职工最近用野生植物——香伏酿酒成功。他们计划在今年下半年酿造六十五度的香伏酒四十七万斤，可为国家节约粮食一百多万斤。
    香伏草生长在山上、地埂及其他杂草丛中。它的根部，生有含大量淀粉的许多疙瘩，这种淀粉的出酒率高达45％。用香伏草制出的酒，色透明，酒味甘美略带香味，十分可口。由于香伏是一种药材，用它制出的酒还有健胃畅心的功效。
    烟台酒厂在用香伏制酒的同时，还蒸馏出0.5％的香伏油，用它可以制造高级香料。
