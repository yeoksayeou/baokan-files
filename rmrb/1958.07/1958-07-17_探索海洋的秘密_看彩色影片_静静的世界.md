    Exploring the Secrets of the Ocean
    ——Watching the Color Film "The Silent World"

    The primitive ocean once nurtured the earliest life on Earth. Even today, the ocean breeds countless diverse organisms.

    The advancement of science and technology has opened up avenues for unveiling the secrets of the ocean. People can now use various special equipment and instruments to conduct on-site observations, investigations, and research on the seabed. They can also record many precious natural phenomena on film. The Soviet color scientific documentary "On the Ice Floes of the Arctic" and "Miracles of the Pacific," which are familiar to Chinese audiences, and the French-made color scientific documentary "The Silent World," which has recently begun showing in China, have all successfully, truthfully, and vividly revealed the secrets of the ocean world to the audience. These three films reflect the characteristics of marine life in three different regions of the Earth, from north to south: the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean.

    "The Silent World" narrates the secrets of the marine world encountered by the scientific expedition ship "Calypso" and its twelve divers on a journey from the Mediterranean Sea through the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. The divers take us to a vibrant and colorful "underwater garden." Crimson, cyan, purple, milky white... corals of various colors, anemones resembling chrysanthemums, and green algae form a magnificent and moving picture, just like a flower garden on land with hundreds of flowers blooming in all their glory. Corals and sea anemones look like plants, and people once regarded them as plants. In fact, they are just lower animals fixed in the sea. Various small animals such as shrimps and the colorful, brightly colored tropical fish that are unique to the tropical oceans live in the flower-like coral reefs. The vitality of the underwater world is astonishingly strong!

    Here, we also see rare herds of dolphins and sperm whales. On the screen, dolphins move forward at a rapid speed, like skilled athletes. They often leap out of the water, which is said to be to breathe fresh air. Sperm whales are behemoths that often follow the warm currents of the ocean in groups. A male whale, about ten female whales, plus many young whales form a "family." The male whale, as the head of this family, does not allow any other male whale to interfere. The largest sperm whales are more than twenty meters long and weigh more than one hundred tons. In addition to storing large amounts of fat in their bodies, they also contain spermaceti (obtained from the prefrontal chamber of the brain) used in cosmetics and valuable ambergris (secretions from the liver and gallbladder) used to fix the scent of some noble perfumes.

    We can also see sharks, known as marine robbers, dismembering whale carcasses in the film. Sharks are ferocious carnivorous fish, with smaller ones less than one meter long and larger ones up to ten meters long. They often greedily hunt for food and even prey on humans.

    The film also tells us about the interesting lives of some marine creatures. When the breeding season for sea turtles arrives, the female turtles come out of the sea and crawl onto the beach. In order to prevent other species from harming their offspring, they often dig holes, lay their eggs, bury them with fine sand, and then leave. Due to the heat of the sun on the beach, the baby turtles hatch two months later. They break through the sand and desperately crawl towards the sea, as if they had been to their old home. There are many similar interesting things in nature. For example, European eels spend most of their lives in the freshwater of rivers on the continent. When they become sexually mature, they begin a long journey of thousands of kilometers to spawn in the western tropics of the Atlantic Ocean, and then all the adult fish die. In this vast ocean where they are completely alone, their offspring will soon return to the rivers where their mothers once lived. How do they know to come back without getting lost? To this day, we still cannot provide more scientifically based explanations for these interesting facts.

    "The Silent World" is a successful film, but its shortcomings include the lack of necessary explanations of the habits or uses of various organisms, and some shots, such as the divers playing with the bass "Sousou," are too lengthy.

    探索海洋的秘密
    ——看彩色影片“静静的世界”
    水手
    原始的海洋，曾经孕育过地球上最早的生命，直到今天，海洋还繁殖着数不清的多种多样的生物。
    科学技术的进步，为揭开海洋的秘密开辟了道路。人们可以借助于各种特殊的装备和仪器，在海底进行现场观察、调查和研究，还可以用电影把许多珍贵的自然现象记录下来。我国观众所熟悉的苏联彩色科学记录片“在北冰洋上”和“太平洋的奇迹”，以及最近开始在我国上映的法国摄制的彩色科学记录片“静静的世界”，都成功地、真实地、生动地把海洋世界的秘密揭露在观众的面前。这三部影片，分别反映出地球上从北到南——北冰洋、太平洋、印度洋这三个不同地区海洋生物的特色。
    “静静的世界”叙述了科学考察船“卡力普索号”和它的十二名潜水员，在一次从地中海经过红海到印度洋的旅程中所遇到的见到的海洋世界的秘密。潜水员把我们带到了百花齐放、丰富多彩的“水下花园”。绛红、青、紫、乳白……各种颜色的珊瑚、菊花似的海葵和绿色的海藻，构成了一幅绮丽动人的图画，就像陆地上百花盛开万紫千红的花圃一样。珊瑚和海葵看起来好像是植物，很早以前，人们也曾经把它们当作植物，其实，它们只不过是固定在海里的低等动物。在花丛似的珊瑚礁里生活着虾等各种各样小动物，还有那些热带海洋所特有的五彩缤纷、色泽鲜艳的热带鱼。海底世界，生命力是惊人的旺盛的！
    在这里，我们也看到了难得看见的成群的海豚和抹香鲸。银幕上，海豚像精练的运动员一样，以飞快的速度前进。它们常常跳跃出水面来，据说这是为了呼吸一口新鲜空气。抹香鲸是庞然大物，常常成群跟着大洋的暖流活动。一个公鲸、十个左右母鲸加上许多幼鲸组成了一个“家族”。做为这个家族家主的公鲸，不允许任何公鲸插足进来。抹香鲸最大的有二十多公尺长一百多公吨重。它们体内除了贮藏大量的脂肪以外，还有化妆品上所用的鲸腊（在脑前室取得的）和贵重的被用做固定某些高贵香水气味用的鲸粪（肝脏胆汁的分泌物）。
    我们还可以从影片中看到被称为海洋强盗的鲨鱼在支解鲸鱼的尸体。鲨鱼是一种凶猛的食肉鱼类，小的不到一公尺，大的可以长达十公尺。它们经常贪婪地追捕食饵，甚至对人类也不放过。
    影片也告诉我们一些海洋生物有趣的生活。大海龟生殖的季节到了，雌龟从海里出来爬上沙滩。为了怕异族对它们子女的侵害，往往是挖好洞产完卵以后，再用细沙把它们掩埋起来，然后才离开。由于沙滩上太阳照射的热力，两个月以后小龟出世了，它们拨开了泥沙，就像曾经去过老家似的拼命向大海爬去。在大自然里，还有许多类似的有趣的事情，例如欧洲河鳗，它们一生大部分时间是在大陆江河的淡水里度过的，等到它们性成熟的时候，就开始了长达几千公里的长途旅行——到大西洋热带的西部产卵，然后成鱼全部死亡。它们的子女在这个举目无亲茫茫大洋里，不久就会回到它们的妈妈曾经生活过的河流里去。它们怎么会知道回来而不至于迷路呢？这些有趣的事实，一直到今天还不能提出更多的有科学根据的解释来。
    “静静的世界”是一部成功的影片，美中不足的是对各种生物的习性或其用途缺少必要的说明，个别镜头如潜水员和鲈鱼“素素”嬉戏也嫌拖得太冗长些。
