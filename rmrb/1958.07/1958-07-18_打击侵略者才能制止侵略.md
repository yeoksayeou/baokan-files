Outside the window, came waves of majestic songs and impassioned slogans, this is Beijing's workers, peasants, professors, students, government officials and citizens resolutely supporting the people of Lebanon and Iraq, resolutely opposing the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon and the Middle East large demonstration! Today's Beijing is boiling plus boiling, the boiling mood of everyone's great leap forward is added to the boiling mood of resolutely supporting the Arab people's resistance to imperialist aggression. My heart is closely linked with the people of the Middle East.

We Chinese people, we Oriental people have a particularly deep understanding of resisting imperialist aggression. The Chinese people once drove the American aggressors out of mainland China. The Chinese and Korean people together repelled the American aggression on the banks of the Yalu River. The Vietnamese people wrote a glorious epic in Dien Bien Phu. The Egyptian and Syrian people successively broke the shackles of imperialism. Yesterday it was Egypt and Syria, today it is Lebanon and Iraq. This illustrates a truth: imperialism is a paper tiger, the East wind will continue to prevail over the West wind, the era when imperialism could do whatever it wanted is long gone.

Iraq is the country that produced the world's most beautiful myths in "One Thousand and One Nights." The people of this country have finally used their own hands, overnight, to break the imperialist and medieval dark rule that had been pressing on their heads for many years, and created a new "One Thousand and One Nights" like a myth.

This is a living reality, a reality that the imperialists are unwilling to accept but must accept. If the imperialists do not calm down a bit, and touch the ass of their paper tiger, and still dream of relying on warships and planes to suppress the Lebanese, Iraqi, and even Arab people who have stood up, and put the shackles back on their heads, that is a twentieth-century "One Thousand and One Nights" that makes people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Because now is no longer the time when imperialism can show off its power, but an era when the East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind!

The imperialists are the most ignorant. Eisenhower and Dulles and the like seem to have an estimation of the strength of the Arab people that is even inferior to that of a three-foot child in Lebanon. There is an old saying in China: "One will not give up until reaching the Yellow River." This shows that "aggression—failure—re-aggression—re-failure" until extinction is the logic of imperialism. The imperialists are unwilling to learn a lesson from a series of failures. Based on the experience of us Chinese people, only by giving the aggressors a double blow is the only good way to stop the aggression of the imperialists.

History is merciless. Imperialism has inevitably reached its setting sun. The oppressed nations all over the world are like the rising sun, breaking the shackles on their bodies and advancing heroically. This is an irresistible objective law.

On the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, the Yalu River, and the Nile River, the imperialists have suffered shameful failures in their competition with the new forces of the world. Today it is the turn of the ancient civilizations of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. If imperialist aggression continues to go its own way, attempting to reverse the wheels of history, it will eventually be buried in the long river of history.

    打击侵略者才能制止侵略
    冯宾符
    窗外传来了一阵阵雄壮的歌声和激昂的口号声，这是北京的工人、农民、教授、学生、机关干部和市民们坚决声援黎巴嫩、伊拉克人民，坚决反对美国武装干涉黎巴嫩和中东的大示威！今天的北京是沸腾加沸腾，人人大跃进的沸腾心情又加上了坚决支持阿拉伯人民反抗帝国主义侵略的沸腾心情。我的心，同中东的人民紧密连结在一起了。
    我们中国人民，我们东方人民对于反抗帝国主义侵略有着特别深刻的体会。中国人民曾经把美国侵略者赶出了中国大陆。中国人民和朝鲜人民一道在鸭绿江畔击退了美国的侵略。越南人民在奠边府写下了光辉的史诗。埃及人民、叙利亚人民接连地打破了帝国主义的桎梏。昨天是埃及和叙利亚，今天是黎巴嫩和伊拉克。这说明了一条真理：帝国主义是纸老虎，东风将继续压倒西风，帝国主义可以为所欲为的时代早已一去不复还了。
    伊拉克是产生世界上最美丽的神话的“天方夜谭”的国家。这个国家的人民，现在终于用自己双手，在一夜间打破了多少年来压在头上的帝国主义和中世纪的黑暗统治，创造了像神话般的新的“天方夜谭”。
    这是活生生的现实，是帝国主义者不愿意接受也得接受的现实。帝国主义者如果再不冷静一些，去摸摸自己纸老虎的屁股，还妄想靠什么兵舰飞机，把站起来了的黎巴嫩、伊拉克乃至阿拉伯的人民压下去，重新把枷锁加在他们的头上，那才是叫人笑痛肚皮的二十世纪的“天方夜谭”。因为现在已不是帝国主义还可以逞威风的时候，而是东风愈来愈压倒西风的时代！
    帝国主义者是最无知的。艾森豪威尔杜勒斯之流，看来对于阿拉伯人民力量的估计，甚至连黎巴嫩的三尺童子还不如。中国有句古话：“不到黄河心不死”。这说明“侵略—失败—再侵略—再失败”以至于灭亡，乃是帝国主义的逻辑。帝国主义者是不甘心从一系列失败中接受教训的。根据我们中国人民的经验，只有予侵略者以加倍的打击，才是制止帝国主义者侵略的唯一妙法。
    历史是无情的。帝国主义已不可避免地日薄崦嵫。全世界被压迫的民族正如旭日东升，打破着身上的枷锁而豪迈前进。这是不可抗拒的客观规律。
    在黄河、长江，在鸭绿江，在尼罗河，帝国主义者在同世界新生力量的较量中都遭到了可耻的失败。今天是到了古文明的幼发拉底河和底格里斯河了。帝国主义侵略如果继续一意孤行，妄图扭转历史的车轮，它们终将葬身在历史的长河里。
