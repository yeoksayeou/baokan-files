The struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois lines on the historical science front did not begin today. This struggle began as early as the May Fourth Movement. For more than thirty years, progressive Chinese historians, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have waged a long-term and resolute struggle against bourgeois professors and commentators. This struggle did not end until the national liberation. As soon as we entered Beijing, bourgeois professors prepared a "Hongmen Banquet" to greet us, in which there was Fan Zeng glaring angrily, and also Xiang Zhuang wielding his sword.

Before the reorganization of colleges and departments, bourgeois professors still attempted to occupy the historical science podium in universities and refused the entry of Marxist historical science into universities. They said progressive historians were of the Pokrovsky school, although they did not know what the content of the Pokrovsky school was. They used what they did not know to oppose Marxist-Leninist historical science. They said this strategy was called "using your spear to attack your shield."

Since the reorganization of colleges and departments, Marxist-Leninist historical science has entered universities and research institutions and has achieved a dominant position. In historical research institutions and historical departments of various colleges and universities across the country, red flags have generally been planted. Even bourgeois professors who later became rightists repeatedly washed their dirty shirts in front of the masses and put on the guise of Marxism-Leninism. On the surface, it seemed that there was no longer a question of two lines in the field of historical science. After the exposure of the "Two Antis" movement, we found that the white flags had not been completely removed, and even black flags like Lei Haizong's openly opposing Marxism-Leninism appeared. If there were fewer white flags, it was because some white flags were painted gray or pink. It is not to say that gray or pink are all bourgeois protective colors. Among bourgeois historians, there are those who seriously study Marxism, but there are also some who only use Marxist terminology as labels, frills, or passports to continue smuggling bourgeois private goods. For example, they also talk about peasant wars, but they castrate the content of class struggle. To give an example, before the reorganization of colleges and departments, a professor lectured on the peasant war at the end of the Qin Dynasty, saying that the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang was not due to class contradictions, but because of rain.

It is very clear that, even now, the specter of bourgeois historical science has not been eliminated in front of us. Some of the most reactionary and stubborn bourgeois historians' ghosts still haunt our historical research and teaching institutions, attempting to find some people to be revived, and some people have already been bewitched by these ghosts. Therefore, until now, the struggle between the two lines on the historical science front is still our serious task.

The most important manifestation of the bourgeois line is the direction of valuing the past over the present, as pointed out by Comrade Chen Boda. In addition, there are also "material-onlyism" and cumbersome textual research, and so on. In short, we want to use the proletarian historical view to interpret history, and they want to use the bourgeois historical view to interpret history. We want to use materialism and dialectics to study history, and they want to use idealism and cumbersome textual research to study history. This is the main divergence between us and bourgeois historians, and it is also the struggle between us.

Must Use Valuing the Present over the Past to Oppose Valuing the Past over the Present

Valuing the past over the present, on the surface, seems to be a matter of interest, but in essence, it is a matter of line. We know that since the May Fourth Movement, bourgeois historical science has been burdened with such a political task, that is, to induce young people to detach themselves from politics and revolutionary struggles. In order to achieve this goal, they advocated a historical direction of valuing the past over the present, guiding young people away from their own times, leading young people from the torrents of the times to the backyard of the times, leading them to the ivory tower of ancient history, letting young people wander in the world of the ancient emperors, and becoming modern ancients. They used fragmented and incomplete documents, and broken copper and rotten iron to cover the eyes of young people, so that young people could not see the aggression of imperialism, could not see the crisis of the national state, could not see the crimes of the reactionary ruling class, could not see the suffering of the people, and more importantly, they wanted to paralyze the ideological consciousness of young people through the study of ancient history, eliminate the revolutionary enthusiasm of young people, and further cultivate reactionary ideas of young people who hate Marxism-Leninism and the Communist Party, in order to weaken the revolutionary forces, and thus historically defend the sinful acts of the reactionary rule.

Bourgeois professors and commentators wanted to use ancient history as their last fortress to resist the proletarian revolution, but they failed. In 1949, the whole country was liberated, and all the bourgeois ancient history fortresses were forced to surrender. Surrendering does not mean the elimination of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, after the end of the War of Liberation, some bourgeois historians used this dilapidated fortress as an ideological air-raid shelter. They fantasized that they could find their own utopia in ancient history, where they could retain a self-cultivated land for themselves to spend their leisurely life of being isolated from the world, and to express their nostalgia for the past. They lost the material world, but always wanted to hold on to their spiritual world. They did not expect that now is no longer the era of Tao Yuanming.

Taking a hostile attitude towards socialism, or at least taking a passive attitude, is the essence of valuing the past over the present.

We must oppose valuing the past over the present, we must go the other way, we must value what they despise and despise what they value, so we fully support the direction of historical science of valuing the present over the past proposed by Comrade Chen Boda. Perhaps bourgeois historians have another fantasy, thinking that the Communist Party probably does not want ancient history anymore. If people abandon something, I will take it. If you don't want it, we want it. You engage in modern history, and we engage in ancient history. Wouldn't this still allow us to contend with you and share the spoils equally? If bourgeois historians think this way, then they are wrong again. We not only want ancient history, but also want to seriously study ancient history, to truly occupy the position of ancient history, and to completely drive the bourgeois idealist historical science out of its last hiding place. When we say valuing the present over the past, we only mean that modern history is more important than ancient history and should be studied with greater effort. Chairman Mao taught us that "we must not only understand China today, but also understand China yesterday and the day before yesterday." This means that we must not only study modern history but also study ancient history. The question is what purpose to study with, and what viewpoint, position, and method to study with. It is very clear that we oppose studying ancient history like bourgeois historians for the sake of "antiquity" and "nostalgia", especially opposing studying ancient history for the purpose of "restoration" or even, like rightists, for the purpose of using the past to criticize the present. We want to study ancient history with an attitude of "reviewing the old and knowing the new." We study ancient history in order to better understand modern history, and study modern history in order to better understand contemporary history. Everything is for the present, for today, for the current socialist leap forward, and for a better tomorrow. Of course, in order to achieve the goal of making the past serve the present, we must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and establish the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and method.

Can ancient history serve today and the present? Absolutely. The most ancient of ancient history is none other than the prehistoric era before humans, but Engels revealed the truth that labor created the world and created humankind itself in his book "From Ape to Man," refuting the myth of God creating humankind believed by the bourgeoisie. The history of the savage and barbarian eras cannot be said to be not the primitive stage of human history, but Engels used the history of this period to explain that humans also experienced an era without monogamous families, private ownership, classes, and states, refuting the fallacy of the bourgeoisie that monogamous families, private ownership, classes, and states were born with humans. The Indian rural commune cannot be said to be not a remnant of ancient history, but Marx used it as a source to "wage a hidden war" against the British destruction of India's native economy. All of this shows that ancient history can be used to serve the present and can be used to serve class struggle. Of course, this does not mean that we can adopt a non-historical attitude and forcibly pull the ancients and ancient events into the present and talk nonsense. When we say that the past serves the present, we mean that the historical experiences of the ancients in labor production, in class struggle, in resisting foreign aggression, and in defending the motherland can serve us. In short, we must summarize all useful historical experiences of the ancients. We must summarize the historical experience of the past hundred years, and also summarize the historical experience of the past several hundred or thousands of years, and use these summarized historical experiences to carry out labor production, class struggle, and patriotic historical education.

People often look for keys to studying history, and they have also found some so-called keys, but they have not seen the real key that Marx prepared for us. Marx told us that "human anatomy is a key to monkey anatomy." He also told us that "capitalist economics provides the key to ancient economics, etc." This means that the study of modern history can provide the key to the study of ancient history. The reason is very simple, that is, the later the history, the more developed and complex its production organization and class relations. Understanding its structure can provide the possibility of thoroughly understanding all social forms that have perished. Of course, this does not mean that we can obliterate all historical differences and say that everything in ancient history is the same as modern history. Because the various relations in ancient history often only appear in a very decadent or exaggerated form in modern history. If modern history also contains things from ancient history, it can only be its remnants.

Studying modern history is much more difficult than studying ancient history. Not only are the historical materials not sorted out, but the events are still in the process of development. Engels praised Marx's "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" as "a brilliant work," "unparalleled." It is because "after this incident occurred, Marx immediately published a concise and satirical narrative," and because of his "such excellent understanding of living and present history, and such clear insight into events when they occurred." Although studying modern history is much more difficult than studying ancient history, Chairman Mao has prepared the key for us to open the door to difficulties. Many of Chairman Mao's works are summaries of living and present history. Chairman Mao has made brilliant and outstanding analyses, generalizations, and judgments on many key issues in modern history. These works not only provide us with the key to studying modern history, but also provide the key to the study of ancient history. As long as we earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, we will be able to solve the problems in modern history easily.

Place Historical Material Work in the Correct Position and Refute Various "Material-Onlyisms"

Exaggerating the role of historical materials is also a characteristic of bourgeois historical science. This characteristic is still popular now. Some professors excessively emphasize the importance of historical materials, believing that with historical materials, they can "stand in an invincible position," and even believe that "historical materials are historical science." It seems that the task of a historian is to collect historical materials, and to collect remote historical materials, to collect historical materials that others have not used. As for the analysis of historical materials, in their view, it is not the task of a historian. And they believe that theoretical analysis of historical materials does not count as historical science. For example, someone said that Sima Guang's "Zizhi Tongjian" is a historical work, but Wang Chuanshan's "Du Tongjian Lun" does not count as a historical work, because the latter夹了议论 [included commentary]. In fact, "Zizhi Tongjian" also has "Chen Guang Yue" [Sima Guang said] which could hardly pass the bourgeois review.

No matter how bourgeois historians pride themselves on mastering historical materials, they nakedly show their weakness, so that they have to try their best to avoid theoretical analysis of major historical issues. Corrupt bourgeois historical science has lost the ability to analyze problems. As Engels said, it "is like a clumsy packhorse, at a loss when faced with the chasm of dividing essence from phenomenon, result from cause." When hunting in this very rugged and dangerous area of history, riding a packhorse will not even catch a small rabbit.

Marxists do not oppose historical material work, and attach importance to historical materials. Engels said: "Even for a single historical instance, it is a scientific work, requiring years of calm research, because it is very clear that nothing can be done with a few empty words. Only a large amount of critically reviewed and thoroughly mastered historical data can solve such a task." Marx also said: "Research must collect rich materials, analyze its different development forms, and explore the internal connections of these various forms. Without first completing this work, there can be no proper explanation of the actual movement." From here, it can be clearly seen that Marx and Engels attached importance to historical materials, and it can also be seen that their emphasis on historical materials is completely different from the emphasis on historical materials by bourgeois historians. Marx and Engels attached importance to historical materials in order to solve major historical problems through analysis and generalization of historical materials, while bourgeois historians use the accumulation and arrangement of historical materials to decorate their erudition and cover up their inability to analyze historical materials. But being covered in jewelry cannot hide the sores on the face.

No matter how important historical materials are, it cannot be said that "historical materials are historical science." Historical materials are to historical science as bricks and tiles are to a house, and cloth is to clothes. We can say that without bricks and tiles, a house cannot be built, and without cloth, clothes cannot be made. Can we say that bricks and tiles are a house, and cloth is clothes? From historical materials to historical science, just like from bricks and tiles to a house, and from cloth to clothes, there is still a series of complex labor processes in between. Just like Chairman Mao said, it also requires the "process of discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other, and from the outside to the inside." And this effort is an extremely meticulous thinking process. Only through this process can a system of concepts and theories be created, can materials be turned into theory, and can historical materials be turned into history. However, bourgeois historians stop historical research at the collection of historical materials.

There is also a kind of "historical material materialism." They say that as long as a work is written based on specific historical data, it is materialism. If so, there would be no idealist historical science in the world, because any historical work in the world is written based on a varying amount of historical materials. However, in reality, there are many idealist historical works in the world, which shows that the same historical materials can be written into materialist works or idealist works. What determines whether historical science is materialist or idealist is not historical materials but the class nature of historians.

The class nature of historians is not only manifested in the analysis and judgment of historical materials, but also in the selection of historical materials. Marx said: "The special nature of the materials of economic research will arouse the most intense, most despicable, and most vicious feelings in people's hearts, and summon the gods of hatred representing private interests to the battlefield to hinder it." The same is true of historical materials. This is why bourgeois historians distort history, tamper with history, and even fabricate history.

In the eyes of bourgeois historians themselves, historical materials are the conditions for their existence in the new society, the capital they use to bargain with the Communist Party, and the weapons they use to resist Marxism-Leninism. But in our view, when a historian does not have the ability to use historical materials, historical materials are not capital or weapons, but only their burden. Engels said: "The spiritually empty capitalist is enslaved by his own capital and profit desires, the lawyer is enslaved by his own fossilized legal views... The generally 'educated class' is enslaved by various local restrictions and one-sidedness, by their incomplete specialized education and the fact of being bound to this skill for life." I think that bourgeois historians, in addition to being enslaved by fossilized idealist historical views, are also enslaved by the historical materials they possess. They should open their baggage to see what is inside.

Reveal the Laws of Historical Development and Liberate from Cumbersome Textual Research

Another characteristic of bourgeois historians is that they emphasize textual research. Some of them engage in local textual research, some engage in foreign textual research, and some engage in a mixture of foreign and local textual research. No matter what kind of textual research they engage in, their understanding of textual research is consistent, that is, they all believe that textual research is the orthodoxy and best of historical research, and everything else, including Marxism-Leninism, are side doors and heresies. To use a common term used by bourgeois historians, they are all "Shanghainese style." In fact, the real "Shanghainese style" is none other than those bourgeois historians themselves who smuggle bourgeois idealism from overseas.

Marxists do not oppose textual research, and believe that it is a necessary step in sorting out historical materials. Through the method of textual research, the reliability of historical materials can be strengthened, so that the conclusions drawn based on this historical material will be more accurate. The role of textual research in historical research is only this. However, bourgeois historians exaggerate it to the ultimate of historical research. Regarding textual research as historical science is just like what Zhang Shizhai said, "It is like pointing to glutinous sorghum and calling it wine." Glutinous sorghum can be turned into wine, but there is still a fermentation and distillation stage lacking in between.

The reason why bourgeois historians emphasize textual research cannot be regarded as a matter of method, but should be said to be a manifestation of class nature. Proletarian historians want to reveal the laws of historical development, and bourgeois historians use the method of textual research to hide and cover up the laws of historical development, because the laws of historical development will explain the inevitability of the demise of the class to which they belong, and will explain that their hegemony will disappear with the demise of their class. Therefore, they cut history apart, cut history into countless unrelated fragments, and isolate these fragments as problems unrelated to other historical events for textual research, leading people's thoughts from the mainstream of historical development to the tributaries, to narrow dead ends, and to a dead end. Let people not see the whole picture of history, the backbone, the context, not see the development of history and the driving force of development, not hear the beating pulse of history, and not see the laws of historical development. It is very clear that so-called textual research is a kind of fragmented and cumbersome doctrine marked with the bourgeois brand.

Bourgeois historians can spend years researching a very unimportant historical event or historical figure, but they are not interested in key historical events. For example, when studying the history of the Tang Dynasty, they can use the greatest interest to study whether Yang Guifei was a virgin before entering the palace, and to study whether Cui Yingying was an official's daughter or a prostitute, while turning a blind eye to the social economy of the Tang Dynasty and some of the major events that occurred in the Tang Dynasty that once shook the world. In fact, even if it is studied whether Yang Guifei was a virgin before entering the palace, or whether Cui Yingying was an official's daughter or a prostitute, how much relationship does it have to the explanation of the history of the Tang Dynasty? Bourgeois historians seem to have a pair of special eyes, and in their eyes, the slightest thing is bigger than Mount Tai.

Cumbersome textual research will inevitably confuse the laws of historical development, because in the advancement of history, there are often some minor events interspersed in the middle. If every minor event is to be examined, it will inevitably lead to paying attention to many unimportant materials and leaving the main line of historical development. For example, when telling or studying the Huang Chao uprising, not analyzing the social and economic conditions and class contradictions at that time, but focusing the research on the textual research of the date when Huang Chao attacked Guangzhou, whether Huang Chao attacked Guangzhou was in the fifth year of Qianfu or the sixth year of Qianfu, or the first year of Guangming; if it was the fifth year of Qianfu, was it in May, September, or November of this year. Of course, it is also good to determine the exact date when Huang Chao occupied Guangzhou, but if the focus of research is shifted to the date of the attack on Guangzhou, then the study of the entire process and even the historical significance of the Huang Chao uprising will be relaxed. Therefore, if you do not liberate yourself from this cumbersome textual research, historians will be entangled in endless minor events and will not be able to escape, and will be like drilling a bull's horn, the more you drill, the narrower it becomes, and the final result is that this road is impassable. It is also like a bookworm, born in a pile of old papers, growing in a pile of old papers, and dying in a pile of old papers, and the only thing left in the end is his own corpse.

At present, this kind of bourgeois cumbersome textual research is still popular in our historical teaching and research. This is a bourgeois historical research method and must be opposed. This method will limit people's minds to the narrowest scope, make them rigid, make people lose the ability to grasp the overall situation of history, and will make people's eyes become nearsighted, so that people's vision is reduced to only seeing their own noses.

Valuing the past over the present, cumbersome textual research, material-onlyism, etc., are all characteristics of bourgeois historical science, and are also the road of bourgeois historical science. We must oppose this road, and we must fight against this bourgeois road. We hope that bourgeois historians will join us in carrying out this struggle, thoroughly criticizing their own bourgeois ideology, and removing the white flag from their minds and planting the red flag.

Hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, hold high the banner of Mao Zedong, and launch a resolute struggle against bourgeois historical science.

    历史科学战线上两条路线的斗争
    翦伯赞
    历史科学战线上无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的斗争，不是从现在才开始的，早在五四时就开始了这个斗争。三十几年来，中国进步的史学家，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，和资产阶级的教授、论客们，进行了长期的坚决的斗争，一直到全国解放，这个斗争并没有结束。我们一进北京，资产阶级的教授们就准备了一个鸿门宴来迎接我们，在这个鸿门宴中，有怒目相视的范增，也有舞剑的项庄。
    在院系调整以前，资产阶级的教授们还是企图霸占大学历史学的讲坛，拒绝马克思主义历史学进入大学。他们说进步的史学家是波克罗夫斯基学派，虽然他们并不知道波克罗夫斯基学派的内容是什么。他们就用他们不知道的东西来反对马克思列宁主义的历史学，他们说，这种战略叫做“以子之矛，攻子之盾”。
    院系调整以来，马克思列宁主义的历史学进入了大学和研究机关，并且取得了支配地位。在全国各地的历史学研究机构和各高等学校的历史系中，一般都插上了红旗；就是后来变成了右派分子的资产阶级教授也曾经一再在群众面前洗涤自己的脏衬衫，并且披上了马克思列宁主义的外衣。从表面上看来，好像在历史学的领域内已经没有两条路线的问题。经过双反运动的揭发，我们发现白旗并没有完全拔掉，甚至还出现了像雷海宗那样公开反对马克思列宁主义的黑旗。如果说白旗少了一些，那是因为有些白旗涂上了灰色或者粉红色。不是说灰色或粉红色，都是资产阶级的保护色，资产阶级的史学家中也有认真学习马克思主义的，但也有一些人只是用马克思主义的词句作为标签、花边或护照继续偷运资产阶级的私货。比如他们也讲农民战争，但阉割它的阶级斗争的内容。举一个例，院系调整以前，有一个教授讲秦末农民战争，说陈涉吴广的起义，不是因为什么阶级矛盾，而是因为下雨。
    很明白，一直到现在，资产阶级历史学的幽灵并没有在我们面前消灭，有些最反动最顽固的资产阶级史学家的鬼影，还是徘徊在我们的历史研究机构和教学机构之中，企图寻找一些人们借尸还魂，而且有些人已经被这种鬼魂迷住了。因此直到现在，历史科学战线上的两条路线斗争，还是我们的严重任务。
    资产阶级路线最主要的表现形式就是陈伯达同志指出的厚古薄今的方向，此外也还有唯史料论和烦琐的考证等等。总之，我们要用无产阶级的历史观来解释历史，他们要用资产阶级的历史观来解释历史。我们要用唯物论、辩证法来研究历史，他们要用唯心论和烦琐的考证来研究历史。这就是我们和资产阶级史学家之间的主要分歧，也是我们之间的斗争。
    必须以厚今薄古反对厚古薄今
    厚古薄今，从表面上看，好像是兴趣问题，实质上是路线问题。我们知道，从五四以来，资产阶级的历史学就负担了这样一个政治任务，即引诱青年脱离政治、脱离革命斗争。为了达到这个目的，他们就提倡厚古薄今的历史学方向，引导青年离开自己的时代，把青年从时代的激流中引导到时代的后院，引导到古史的象牙之塔，让青年悠游于羲皇上世，作一个现代的古人。他们用断简残篇、破铜烂铁来遮蔽青年的眼睛，让青年看不见帝国主义的侵略，看不见民族国家的危机，看不见反动统治阶级的罪恶，看不见人民群众的痛苦，更重要的是要通过古史的研究来麻痹青年的思想意识，消灭青年的革命热情，进一步培养青年仇视马克思列宁主义，仇视共产党的反动思想，借以削弱革命的力量，并从而历史地辩护反动统治的罪恶行为。
    资产阶级的教授和论客们是想把古代史当作他们最后的堡垒用以对抗无产阶级革命，但是他们失败了。1949年，全国解放，所有的资产阶级的古史堡垒都被迫树了降旗。树了降旗，不等于资产阶级思想的消灭，因此解放战争结束以后，又有些资产阶级的史学家利用这个残破的堡垒作为思想的防空洞。他们幻想在古代史中会可以找到自己的世外桃源，在这里可以让他们保留一块独善其身的自留地，以过度其遗世而独立的悠闲生活，以发泄其思古之幽情。他们失去了物质世界，但总想守住他们的精神世界，他们没有想到现在已经不是陶渊明的时代了。
    对社会主义采取对立的态度，至少采取消极的态度，这就是厚古薄今的实质。
    我们必须反对厚古薄今，必须反其道而行之，必须厚其所薄而薄其所厚，因此我们完全拥护陈伯达同志提出的厚今薄古的历史学的方向。也许资产阶级史学家，又有一种遐想，以为共产党大概是不要古史了，人弃我取，你们不要我们要，你们搞近代现代史，我们搞古代史，这样还不是可以和你们分庭抗礼、平分秋色吗？如果资产阶级的史学家这样想，那又错了，我们不但要古代史，并且要认真的研究古代史，要真正地占领古代史的阵地，要彻底地把资产阶级的唯心论的历史学从它最后的隐蔽所驱逐出去。我们说厚今薄古，只是说近代现代史比古代史更为重要，应该用更大的力量去研究而已。毛主席教导我们“不但要懂得中国的今天，还要懂得中国的昨天和前天”。这就是说不但要研究近代现代史也要研究古代史。问题就在于抱着什么目的去研究，用什么观点、立场和方法去研究。很明白，我们反对像资产阶级史学家一样为着“好古”、“怀古”的兴趣主义去研究古代史，尤其反对为着“复古”乃至像右派分子一样抱着以古非今的目的去研究古代史，我们要以“温故而知新”的态度研究古代史。我们研究古代史是为了更好地懂得近代史，研究近代史是为了更好地懂得现代史。一切都为了为现代，为了今天，为了眼前的社会主义大跃进，为了更好的明天。当然，要做到古为今用，就必须彻底批判资产阶级的立场、观点和方法，建立无产阶级的立场、观点和方法。
    古代史是不是可以为今天为现代服务呢？完全可以。最古的古代史，莫过于未有人类的洪荒时代，然而恩格斯却在从猿到人的著作中揭示了劳动创造世界、创造人类自身的真理，驳斥了资产阶级所信奉的上帝创造人类的神话。蒙昧和野蛮时代的历史不能说不是人类历史的原始阶段，然而恩格斯却利用这一时期的历史说明了人类也曾经过没有一夫一妻家族、私有制，阶级和国家的时代，驳斥了资产阶级认为一夫一妻家族、私有制、阶级、国家是与人类俱生的谬论。印度的农村共同体，不能说不是古代历史的残余，然而马克思却用它作资料对英国破坏印度本土的经济“进行隐蔽的战争”。这些都说明了古代史是可以用来为现代服务的，是可以为阶级斗争服务的。当然这不是说我们就可以采取一种非历史主义的态度，牵强附会地把古人古事都拉扯到现代来随便乱说。我们说古为今用，是说古人在劳动生产中的、在阶级斗争中的、在反抗外来侵略和保卫祖国中的历史经验可以为我们服务。总之是要总结古代一切有用的历史经验。我们要总结近百年来的历史经验，也要总结几百年几千年来的历史经验，要用这些总结出来的历史经验，进行劳动生产的、阶级斗争的和爱国主义的历史教育。
    人们常常寻找研究历史的钥匙，他们也找到了一些所谓钥匙，就是没看见马克思替我们预备好了的一把真正的钥匙。马克思告诉我们“人体解剖对于猴体解剖是一把钥匙”。他又告诉我们“资本主义经济为古代经济等等提供了钥匙”。这就是说近代现代史的研究可以替古代史的研究提供钥匙。理由很简单，即愈是后来的历史，它就具有更为发达更为复杂的生产组织和阶级关系，理解它的结构，就可以提供透彻的理解一切已经覆灭了的社会形态的可能性。当然这不是说我们就可以抹煞一切历史的差别而把古代史上的一切都说成和近代现代史一样的。因为古代史上的各种关系常常只能在十分衰败或夸张的形态上在近代史里面出现，如果说近代史也包含着古代史的东西，那也只能是它的残余。
    研究近代现代史比研究古代史要难得多，不但史料没有整理，而且事件还在发展的过程中。恩格斯称赞马克思所写的“拿破仑第三政变记”“是一部天才的著作”，“天下无双”的著作。就是因为“在这一事变发生之后，马克思立即就发表一个简洁的讽刺的叙述”，就因为他“对于活的眼前的历史之如此卓越的理解，在事件发生时对于事件之如此明晰之洞察”。研究近代现代史虽然比起研究古代史要难得多，但是毛主席已经替我们准备了打开困难之门的钥匙。毛主席的著作有很多都是对于活的眼前的历史的总结。对于近代现代史上的许多带有关键性的问题，毛主席都作了天才的卓越的分析概括和论断，这些著作不仅给我们研究近代现代史提供了钥匙，同时也对古代史的研究提供了钥匙。只要我们认真地研究毛主席的著作，我们对于近代现代史中的问题就会迎刃而解。
    把史料工作放在正确地位，驳斥各种“唯史料论”
    夸大史料的作用也是资产阶级历史学的特点。这种特点，现在还在流行。有些教授过分地强调史料的重要性，认为有了史料，就可以“立于不败之地”，甚至认为“史料即史学”。好像一个史学家的任务就在于搜集史料，而且是搜集偏僻的史料，搜集别人不曾用过的史料，至于史料的分析，在他们看来，就不是史学家的任务。并且认为对史料进行了理论的分析就不算史学。例如有人说司马光的“资治通鉴”是史学著作，王船山的“读通鉴论”就不算史学著作，因为后者夹了议论。其实“资治通鉴”也有“臣光曰”几几乎通不过资产阶级的审查。
    不论资产阶级史学家怎样以掌握史料自负，却赤裸裸地表现出自己的虚弱，以致不得不极力回避对历史上重大问题的理论分析。腐朽的资产阶级历史学已经丧失了分析问题的能力，正像恩格斯所说的它“好比笨重的驮马，面临着划分本质与现象、结果与原因的鸿沟就一筹莫展了”。要在历史学这个十分崎岖险阻的地带出猎的时候，骑着驮马那是连一个小兔子也打不着的。
    马克思主义者并不反对史料工作，而且重视史料。恩格斯说过：“那怕是单单对于一个历史实例，都是一种科学工作，要求多年的冷静钻研，因为这是很明白的，单靠几句空话是做不出什么来的，只有大量的批判地审查过的透彻地掌握住了的历史资料，才能解决这样的任务。”马克思也说过：“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析他的不同的发展形态，并探寻出这各种形态的内部联系。不先完成这种工作，便不能对于现实的运动，有适当的说明”。从这里很清楚地可以看出马克思恩格斯对史料的重视，也可以看出他们之重视史料和资产阶级史学家之重视史料是完全不同的。马克思恩格斯之所以重视史料是要通过对史料的分析、概括，解决历史上的重大问题，而资产阶级史学家则是用史料的堆积与排列，装饰自己的博学，掩盖自己对史料分析的无能。但是珠翠满头，并不能掩盖脸上的疮疤。
    不论史料怎样重要，总不能说“史料即史学”。史料之于史学，正像砖瓦之于房子，布帛之于衣服，我们可以说，没有砖瓦盖不起房子，没有布帛做不成衣服，我们能够说砖瓦即房子，布帛即衣服吗？从史料到史学，正像从砖瓦到房子，从布帛到衣服一样，中间还要经过一系列的复杂的劳动过程。正像毛主席所说的还要经过“去粗取精，去伪存真，由此及彼，由表及里的改造制作工夫”。而这种工夫是一种极其细致的思考过程，只有经过这种过程，才能造成概念和理论的系统，才能把材料变成理论，才能变史料为历史。然而资产阶级的史学家却把历史研究停止在史料的采集。
    还有一种“史料唯物论”。他们说只要是根据具体历史资料写成的著作，就是唯物论。如果这样，世界上就没有唯心论的史学了，因为世界上的任何历史著作都是根据多少不等的史料写成的。然而在实际上在世界上却存在着很多唯心论的历史著作，这就说明了同样的史料可以写成唯物论的著作，也可以写成唯心论的著作。决定历史学的唯物与唯心的不是史料而是史学家的阶级性。
    史学家的阶级性，不仅表现在对史料的分析与论断上，也表现在史料的选择上。马克思说：“经济学研究的材料的特殊性质，会把人心中最激烈最卑鄙最恶劣的感情唤起，把代表私人利益的仇神召到战场上来阻碍它”。历史的资料也是一样，这就是为什么资产阶级的史学家要歪曲历史涂改历史甚至捏造历史的原因。
    在资产阶级史学家自己看来，史料是他们可以在新社会存在的条件，是他们用以和共产党讨价还价的资本，是他们对抗马克思列宁主义的武器，但是在我们看来，当一个史学家没有能力运用史料的时候，史料并不是什么资本或武器而只是他们的包袱。恩格斯说：“精神上空洞的资本家为自己资本，自己利润欲所奴役，律师为自己化石似的法律观所奴役……一般‘有教养的阶级’为各种地方限制及片面性所奴役，为自己残缺的专门教育及终身缚束于这一门技能的事实所奴役”。我以为资产阶级的史学家，除了为化石般的唯心主义的历史观所奴役以外，又为自己所占有的史料所奴役。他们应该把包袱打开看看到底有些什么东西。
    揭示历史发展的规律，从烦琐的考证中解放出来
    资产阶级的史学家还有一个特点，就是强调考证，他们之中有些搞土考证，有些搞洋考证，还有洋土混的考证，不论是搞哪一种考证的人，他们对于考证的认识是一致的，即他们都认为考证是历史学研究的正统、上乘，一切其他，包括马克思列宁主义在内都是傍门左道，用资产阶级史学家常用的一个名词来说都是海派。其实真正的海派，不是别人，正是那些从海外贩运资产阶级唯心论的资产阶级史学家自己。
    马克思主义者并不反对考证，而且认为它是整理史料的一个必要的步骤。通过考证的方法，可以加强史料的可靠性，从而依据这种史料作出来的结论也就更为正确。考证在历史研究中的作用，仅此而已。然而资产阶级史学家却把它夸大为历史研究的终极。把考证当作历史学，这就正像章实斋所说的“是犹指秫忝以为酒也”。秫忝可以变为酒，但其间还缺乏一个发酵和蒸馏的阶段。
    资产阶级史学家之所以强调考证不能认为是方法问题，应该说是阶级性的表现。无产阶级的史学家要揭示历史发展的规律，资产阶级史学家就用考证的方法来隐蔽和遮盖历史发展的规律，因为历史发展的规律会说明他们所属的阶级的灭亡的必然性，会说明他们的霸权将随着自己的阶级的灭亡而消灭。因此，他们就割裂历史，把历史切成无数互不相关的碎片，而把这些碎片作为与其他历史事件无关的问题孤立地去考证，把人们的思想从历史发展的主流引到支流，引到狭窄的死胡同，引到牛角尖里去。让人们看不见历史的全貌，历史的骨干，脉络，看不见历史的发展和发展的动力，听不到历史跳动的脉搏，更看不到历史发展的规律。很明白，所谓考证是一种打上了资产阶级烙印的寻章摘句支离破碎的烦琐主义。
    资产阶级的史学家可以穷年累月为着一个极不重要的历史事件或历史人物的研究而疲精劳神，但对于带有关键性的历史事件就不感兴趣。举例来说，他们研究唐史，可以用最大的兴趣去考证杨贵妃入宫以前是不是处女，考证崔莺莺是官家小姐还是妓女，而对于唐代的社会经济以及发生在唐代的曾经震撼世界的若干大事则视若无睹。其实杨贵妃入宫以前是不是处女，崔莺莺是官家小姐还是妓女，即使考出来了对于唐代历史的说明又有多大的关系呢？资产阶级史学家好像有一双特殊的眼睛，在他们的眼底秋毫比泰山更要大些。
    烦琐的考证必然要淆混历史发展的规律，因为在历史的前进中，常常会有一些细微的事件夹在当中，如果对于每一个细微的事件都要加以考证，那就必然会为了注意到许多无关重要的材料而离开历史发展的主要脉络。比如当讲述或研究黄巢起义的时候不去分析当时社会经济状况，阶级矛盾，而把研究的重点放在黄巢攻进广州的日期的考证，考证黄巢攻入广州的日期到底是乾符五年或者是乾符六年，还是广明元年；如果是乾符五年，到底是这年的5月，还是9月或者是冬月。当然把黄巢攻占广州的日期考证确切，也有好处，但是如果把研究的重点转移到攻进广州的日期问题，那就放松了对黄巢起义的全部过程乃至历史意义的研究。因此，如果不从这种烦琐的考证中解放出来，史学家就会纠缠在无穷无尽的细微事件上面而不得脱身，就会像钻牛角一样，愈钻愈窄，最后的结果是此路不通。也就像蠹鱼一样，生在故纸堆中，长在故纸堆中，死在故纸堆中，而最后留下来的唯一的东西，是自己的尸体。
    现在这种资产阶级的烦琐考证，在我们的历史教学中和研究中还在流行，这是资产阶级的历史研究方法，必须反对，这种方法会把人的头脑局限在最狭窄的范围内，使其僵化，使人失去掌握历史全局的能力，会使人的眼睛变成近视，以至使人眼光缩小到只看见自己的鼻子。
    厚古薄今，烦琐的考证，唯史料论等等，都是资产阶级历史学的特点，也是资产阶级历史学的道路，我们必须反对这种道路，必须和这种资产阶级的道路进行斗争，我们希望资产阶级的史学家和我们一道来进行这个斗争，彻底地批判自己的资产阶级思想，从自己的头脑中拔掉白旗，插上红旗。
    高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，高举毛泽东的旗帜，对资产阶级历史学展开坚决的斗争。
