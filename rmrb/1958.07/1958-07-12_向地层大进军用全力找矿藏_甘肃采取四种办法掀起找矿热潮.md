(Our Dispatch from Lanzhou, July 11) Gansu Province has shattered the view that "geological work is mysterious" and has formed a mass movement led by the whole Party and the entire people to engage in geology, providing a resource guarantee for the large-scale development of local industries.

Following the high tide of the entire province engaging in local industry, a contradiction immediately arose where the resource situation could not meet the needs of industrial development. Although geological work in the past few years had found a considerable amount of mineral reserves for national industrial construction, it had not paid attention to serving local industries. As a result, there were too few types of mineral deposits suitable for local mining. In order to make geological work keep up with the development of local industry, the entire province adopted the following four methods to unleash a mass movement for the whole Party and the entire people to find minerals.

First, through Party organizations in various places, universally mobilize the masses to search for minerals by walking through every mountain, every gully, and every ridge. The work of the masses in Weiyuan County in finding minerals was discussed at the Party congress and the county party committee expansion meeting, and the masses were mobilized to discuss it. In June, the county launched a "small axe reporting minerals" campaign with more than 10,000 people participating. The county party secretary, township party committee secretaries, and branch secretaries of agricultural cooperatives took the lead in going up the mountains, resulting in a high tide of finding and reporting minerals. The county quickly found more than 100 mineral locations. In the last ten days of June, Lintao County mobilized more than 7,000 people to go up the mountains in two days, finding minerals such as iron, nickel, and magnesium.

Second, in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the masses in finding minerals, the Gansu Geological Bureau dispatched professional geologists to counties to hold rapid training classes, train junior geological survey personnel, and rapidly cultivate thousands of peasant geological survey team members. They became the backbone of the masses in finding minerals. In order to develop survey work, geological bureaus have now been established in various special districts throughout the province, and geological teams have been established in various counties, and a geological survey network has begun to be formed throughout the province.

Third, in order to ensure that the value of ore is quickly determined, the staff of the Lanzhou Central Laboratory of the Gansu Geological Bureau created the "Rapid Chemical Analysis Method" (i.e., simple assaying). Using this method, one person can analyze fifteen samples a day and can make qualitative and quantitative analyses of ten kinds of ores, including iron, manganese, chromium, nickel, copper, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and phosphorus, in one day. The analysis results of many mineral samples can be seen within two hours. At present, the Geological Bureau has trained more than 100 rapid assayers who have made conclusions on many mineral samples.

Fourth, in order to understand the amount of minerals and quickly hand them over to various places for development, organize key concentrated drilling work. As of the end of June, the Gansu Geological Bureau had extracted 13 survey drills to conduct concentrated drilling at 40 drill sites in eight counties in the West Qinling area.

Through the above methods, Gansu Province has found hundreds of mineral deposits in the past two or three months, and some have initially determined the amount of minerals. Iron, coal, oil, aluminum, zinc, etc., have basically met the needs of developing local smelting industry and other industries this year and next. (Li Longyun)

### 向地层大进军用全力找矿藏  甘肃采取四种办法掀起找矿热潮

    向地层大进军用全力找矿藏
    甘肃采取四种办法掀起找矿热潮
    本报兰州11日电　甘肃省打破“地质工作神秘”的观点，形成了全党全民办地质的热潮，为大办地方工业提供了资源保证。
    甘肃形成全民办地方工业的高潮以后，立即出现了资源状况不能满足工业发展需要的矛盾。过去几年来，地质工作虽然曾为国家建设大工业找到了不少矿种的储量。但是由于没有注意到为地方工业服务，因而适合地方开采的矿藏种类太少，为了使地质工作跟上地方工业的发展，全省采用了以下四种方法，掀起了全党全民找矿的高潮。
    第一，通过各地党的组织，普遍发动群众，走遍每一座山、每一条沟、每一条岭找矿。渭源县群众找矿的工作，曾在党代会和县委扩大会上进行讨论，又发动群众讨论。6月份，全县展开了有一万多人参加的“小斧头报矿”运动。县委书记、乡党委书记和农业社的支部书记都带头上山，出现了找矿、报矿的高潮。全县很快找到了矿点一百多处。临洮县6月份下旬的两天内，即动员了七千多人上山，找到了铁、镍、镁等矿。
    第二，为了提高群众找矿的效率和准确性，甘肃地质局派出了专业地质人员，到县上举办快速训练班，培养初级地质勘查人员，迅速地培养起成千上万名农民地质普查队员。成为群众找矿的骨干。为了发展普查工作，目前全省各专区都建立了地质局，各县都成立了地质队，全省内开始组成了地质普查网。
    第三，为了保证迅速决定矿石的价值，甘肃地质局兰州中心化验室职工创造了“快速化学分析方法”（即简易化验）。使用这种方法，一个人一天能分析十五个样品，能在一天内对铁、锰、铬、镍、铜、铝、镁、钙、锌、磷十种矿石作出定性和定量分析。不少的矿样可在二小时内看到分析的结果。现在，地质局已训练出一百多个快速化验员，对不少矿样作出了结论。
    第四，为了了解矿量和迅速交给各地开发，组织重点突击钻探工作。到6月底止，甘肃地质局已抽出十三台普查钻，在西秦岭地区八个县的四十个钻点上突击钻探。
    通过上述方法，甘肃省两三个月来，已找到数百种矿藏，有些已初步确定了矿量。铁、煤、油、铝、锌等，基本上满足了今明年发展地方冶炼工业及其它工业的需要。　（李龙云）
