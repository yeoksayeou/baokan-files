    一亩油菜究竟能产多少？
    麻城县燎原一社已经创造了1310斤
    本报讯　湖北麻城县梁家畈乡燎原一社技术试验组有一亩七分九厘油菜地，创造了平均亩产一千三百一十斤的纪录。经过实地详细验收、测算，这块地的油菜一般株高五尺六寸多，平均每株结荚三百二十五个，每个荚平均包有油籽三十五点八粒。
    参加这块地验收的有中共麻城县委书记处书记侯尚武，白杲指导组长汪凤元，乡总支书记李学文，社党支部书记梁德魁，社主任彭思汉，还有县农业局技术指导站长朱杏仪和部分验收组的工作干部。在验收过程中，除亲自参加收、打、过秤外。还对这块地进行了重新丈量，核实了面积。
    创造这块油菜高产奇迹的主人，是技术试验组长董友志和亲密的劳动伴侣董秋成。他们在党的正确领导下，大胆推行科学技术，刻苦钻研，革新创造，像绣花一样的细致栽培这块试验地。
