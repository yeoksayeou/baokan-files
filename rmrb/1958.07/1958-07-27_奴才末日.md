    End of the Lackeys
    Zhi Bomin
    The last king of Iraq, Faisal, was destroyed in the people's anger; leaving the last king of Jordan, Hussein, still making a spectacle of himself.

    This tyrant and lackey, Hussein, is sometimes sober and sometimes delirious. When sober, he is scared to death, wishing he could kneel down and beg his American and British masters to let him escape and find someone who is not afraid of death to continue to act as a puppet, and die in his place.

    According to a report from the "Al-Akhbar" correspondent in London, Hussein once implored the American and British ambassadors to ask his masters: "He is not sure about the domestic situation, so he should abdicate and take refuge abroad," to see if the masters would agree. It is said that: "The ambassadors were surprised by his words," and asked him to brace himself and stay there, so he had to continue with a mournful face. But he begged to send American troops to "escort" him as soon as possible.

    What were the ambassadors "surprised" about? Probably "surprised" that this lackey was too useless, "rotten wood cannot be carved," and British troops had already been sent to "escort" him, what was he still afraid of? In fact, the ambassadors wronged their lackey. Hussein knew his situation better than his masters. He knew that he was just a puppet, and the nationwide people’s knives aimed at imperialism were primarily pointed at him. He also knew how powerful the people were, and how could a few British troops protect him from this great danger? He also knew that it was precisely the arrival of the British aggressors that further ignited the flames of the people’s revolution, which is why the Jordanian people broke out in a general strike and large-scale demonstrations. Explosions occurred in front of the residences of ministers, and some British soldiers themselves were killed by righteous and angry people. He also heard the warning from the people: "Faisal's fate is waiting for you." He also knew that even some American and British newspapers pointed out that the British troops in Jordan could not resolve the misfortune of the Jordanian dynasty. So his fear of death was a manifestation of his true sobriety.

    However, he often had delirium, the most recent being on the 24th of this month. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, when asked about his prospects for exercising power in Iraq as the head of the Arab Federation, he said, "We are preparing, and I hope that with the help of our friends in the free world, we will soon be able to rescue Iraq from the predicament it has fallen into..." A person who asked to escape during the day suddenly thought of "rescuing" others at night.

    At this time, he seemed to have temporarily forgotten his situation, as if the disaster over his head had passed, as if he were a majestic head of state. He seemed to have forgotten that the so-called Arab Federation had long ceased to exist. If he really dared to stick his snout into Iraq, only axes would be waiting for him. He seemed to have forgotten that he was just a toy of imperialism, and without the master's strings, he couldn't even move his limbs.

    This delirium is further proof that the last king's end has come, and let's see how many more days and nights he can survive.

    He is sometimes sober and sometimes delirious. When sober, he tells people about his real situation in his own country; when delirious, he expresses his vicious and insidious inner thoughts to people, "a dog cannot change its habit of eating excrement," and he will never forget to conquer the liberated Arabs for his masters until his death. We should not only see the lackey's confusion and find it funny, but we should also learn a lesson from a die-hard imperialist lackey. The loyal lackeys of imperialism never forget to do evil for their masters until they die, because their will is essentially the master's will, and we must not have any illusions about them; and we must understand that the situation of the lackeys and their masters is indeed bad, and there is no need to be intimidated by their pretentious faces.

    Courage and determination are the best ways to deal with imperialism and its lackeys.

    奴才末日
    支伯民
    伊拉克的末代国王费萨尔，在人民的怒火里毁灭了；丢下了约旦的末代国王侯赛因，还在活现眼。
    这个暴君兼奴才的侯赛因，有时清醒又有时热昏。清醒时他害怕得要死，恨不得跪下来哀求美英主子，立即放他逃生，另换一个不怕死的人来继续充当傀儡，也替他代死。
    据开罗“消息报”驻伦敦记者报道，侯赛因曾恳求美国和英国大使，代他向主子请示一下：“他对国内的局势没有把握，因此他应该逊位并且避居国外”，看主子们答应不答应？据说：“大使们对他的这番话感到惊讶”，要他硬着头皮顶在那儿，于是他只好哭丧着脸捱下去。但是却又哀求赶快再派美国兵来“保驾”。
    大使们“惊讶”什么呢？大概“惊讶”的是这个奴才太没出息，“死狗扶不上墙”，已经派来了英国大军“保驾”了，还怕些什么呢？其实，这是大使们错怪了自己的奴才，侯赛因是比主子们更清楚自己的处境的。他何尝不知道，自己只不过是个傀儡，而全国人民砍向帝国主义的刀锋，又首先是对准着他的；他又何尝不知道，人民的力量是何等的强大，区区的一些英国军队怎能保得了这个大险？他何尝不知道，正是英国侵略军的到来，更加激发了人民的革命火焰，约旦人民才爆发了总罢工和大示威，大臣的住宅门前发生了爆炸，英国兵本身有的也曾被正义而又激怒的人所杀死；他何尝听不到来自人民中间的“费萨尔的命运正等着你”的警告；他又何尝不知道，就连美国和英国的一些报纸，都指出了英国军队在约旦，并不能够解除约旦王朝的厄运。所以他的怕死，倒是他真正清醒时的表现。
    然而他又时常发热昏，最近的一次是在本月24日。据路透社伦敦的电讯说，有人问到他以阿拉伯联邦首脑的身份对伊拉克行使权力的前景如何？他说“我们正在准备，我希望在我们自由世界的朋友援助下，我们很快能够把伊拉克从它所陷入的困境中……拯救出来。”一个在白天还曾要求逃命的人，在晚上就忽然想到要去“拯救”别人了。
    在这时，他似乎暂时忘掉了自己的处境，好像头上的灾难已经过去，仿佛他真的是什么威风凛凛的大元首了；他似乎已经忘记了所谓阿拉伯联邦早已不存在了，如果他真的敢于把猪鼻子伸进伊拉克，等待他的只有斧头。他似乎忘记了他只不过是帝国主义的一个玩具，没有主子的牵线，他连手足都动不起来的。
    这热昏正又证明着这个末代国王的末运到了，看他还能过得了几个白天和黑夜。
    他有时清醒又有时热昏。清醒时他向人述说着他在自己国家里的真实处境；热昏时他却向人表述着自己的凶恶阴险的内心，“是狗改不了吃屎”，他是至死不忘去替主子征服解放了的阿拉伯人的。我们不要只看到一个奴才的神昏颠倒而好笑，我们还要从一个死心踏地的帝国主义奴才身上去接受教训。帝国主义的忠实奴才是临死都不忘帮主人作恶的，因为它的意志实质只不过是主子的意志，决不可对他们存在有什么幻想；而且要懂得奴才及其主子们的处境的确不妙，无需因他们装腔作势的面孔而胆怯。
    勇敢而且坚决，就是对付帝国主义及其奴才的最好方法。
