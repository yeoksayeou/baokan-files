    Rubber Planted in the Shiwan Mountains
    Deep in the Shiwan Mountains of Dongxing Autonomous County, Guangdong Province, rubber has been produced for the first time. On July 9th, the staff of the state-owned Huoguang Farm were very excited to tap 180 rubber trees for the first time. Each tree produced latex, with the most productive yielding seven cc.
    Rubber had never been planted in the Shiwan Mountains before. Huoguang Farm only started planting rubber in 1952. The severe cold in the winter of 1954 injured the planted saplings, but with the diligent care of the staff, the injured saplings continued to grow rapidly. They also continuously sowed rubber seeds on large areas of the mountains. Now, the surrounding ten or so hills around Huoguang Farm are covered with green leaves. The trees being tapped now were all planted in 1952. (Xinhua News Agency)

    十万大山种橡胶
    广东省东兴各族自治县的十万大山深处，首次出产橡胶。7月9日，国营火光农场的职工们十分兴奋地第一次割了一百八十株橡胶。每株都流出胶液，其中最多的出胶七西西。
    十万大山自古没有种过橡胶。1952年起，火光农场才开始种植橡胶。1954年冬的严寒，曾使已种的树苗受伤，但在职工们的日夜辛勤护理下，受伤的树苗继续迅速成长着。他们还不断在大片的山岭播下橡胶种子。现在，在火光农场周围的十几个山岭上，已经绿叶成荫。目前动手割取橡胶的树，都是1952年种下的。　（新华社）
