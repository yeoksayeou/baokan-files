Xinhua News Agency, July 26th, Tokyo: The "Economic White Paper" presented by Nobusuke Kishi's government's Economic Planning Agency Director-General, Takeo Miki, at the cabinet meeting on the 25th, stated that the Japanese economy has completely fallen into a state of overproduction, production continues to decline, and the current economic crisis will require a considerable amount of time to "recover."

This "White Paper" focuses on how to deal with Japan's economic crisis.

The "White Paper" proposes strengthening production restrictions and reducing inventories as one of the main ways to deal with the overproduction crisis, while also emphasizing the necessity of expanding exports.

The "White Paper" believes that Japan can only "develop its economy" within the limits allowed by its balance of international payments in the future; to truly restore the Japanese economy, it will require even more time than when restrictive financial policies were implemented in 1954.

Kyodo News commentator Keiji Mizutani pointed out in a short commentary on the 25th that the Japanese economy faces a more difficult situation than the "White Paper" acknowledges. Mizutani further pointed out that one of the roots of the crisis in Japan this year lies in the overcapacity of production equipment worldwide under capitalism, and the problem cannot be solved simply by adjusting domestic inventories.

Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, Tokyo: The overproduction crisis in the shipbuilding and textile industries, which occupy an important position in Japanese industry, is becoming increasingly serious. This situation indicates that Japan's economic crisis is becoming prolonged and deepening.

The Japan Shipbuilders' Association said that as of the end of March, the total orders on hand at various shipyards were approximately 3.7 million tons, a decrease of 400,000 tons from last year. However, due to the impact of the capitalist world economic crisis, foreign shipowners in the United States and Greece have continuously canceled shipbuilding contracts, and the orders on hand at Japanese shipyards at the end of June decreased by another 350,000 tons compared to the end of March.

The sharp decline in shipbuilding orders and the depletion of funds have led to the closure of many shipyards. By mid-July, the number of bankrupt shipyards had increased to ten, and another ten shipyards are expected to close within a few months. According to the Japan Shipbuilders' Association, even among the 65 docks in the 24 major shipyards, more than a dozen currently have no orders. By the end of September, another 39 docks will be idle.

According to statistics, 70% to 80% of Japan's total shipbuilding tonnage is exported. Last year, Japan's total ship exports reached 345 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 12% of the total exports in the same year. Japanese economic circles are seriously concerned that the sharp decline in ship exports will have a serious impact on the entire export plan for 1958.

The textile industry, on which Japanese capitalism relies, is also deeply mired in crisis.

In order to alleviate the overproduction crisis, the Japanese textile industry has already reduced its operating rate by an average of 30%. Cotton yarn production has decreased from an average of 100 million pounds per month in 1957 to the current 73 million pounds. However, despite this, as of the middle of this month, cotton yarn inventories still exceeded normal inventory levels by 30% to 40%. The situation for rayon is even more serious than for cotton yarn, with inventory levels reaching two and a half times the normal inventory levels.

The severe crisis has first crushed small and medium-sized textile enterprises. According to a survey by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, as of the end of June, 427 small and medium-sized manufacturers had gone bankrupt, with deficits amounting to 11 billion yen. It is expected that the wave of bankruptcies will continue to spread and expand. Faced with this situation, representatives of manufacturers in Osaka, Nagoya, Shizuoka Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and other places, which have 17,000 textile factories, recently held a "Crisis Overcoming Conference" in Tokyo, deciding to generally increase the operating rate reduction from 30% to 50% starting in August. Kyodo News said that the reduction in production by the Japanese textile industry to this extent is the first time since the war.

### 岸信介政府“经济白皮书”承认  日本经济危机将旷日持久  造船业和纺织业生产过剩和倒闭情况日益严重

    岸信介政府“经济白皮书”承认
    日本经济危机将旷日持久
    造船业和纺织业生产过剩和倒闭情况日益严重
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府经济企划厅长官三木武夫25日在内阁会议上提出的“经济白皮书”说，日本经济已经完全陷入生产过剩状态，生产继续下降，目前的经济危机需要相当长的时间才能“恢复”。
    这次发表的“白皮书”着重谈到如何应付日本的经济危机问题。
    “白皮书”提出把加强限制生产、削减库存作为应付生产过剩危机的主要办法之一，同时着重强调了扩大输出的必要性。
    “白皮书”认为，日本今后只能在国际收支所允许的范围内“发展经济”；要想使日本经济真正恢复，就需要比1954年实行紧缩金融政策时更长的时间。
    日本共同社评论员水谷启二25日在一篇短评中指出，日本经济面临着比“白皮书”所承认的更加困难的局面。水谷进一步指出，今年日本发生的危机的根源之一在于资本主义世界范围的生产设备过剩，不能只用调整国内存货的办法来解决问题。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：在日本工业中占重要地位的造船业和纺织业的生产过剩危机日益严重。这种情况表明，日本的经济危机正在长期化和深刻化。
    日本造船协会说，到3月底为止，各造船厂手头的订货单总共约有三百七十万吨，已经比去年减少了四十万吨。但是，由于资本主义世界经济危机的影响，美国和希腊等外国船主不断取消造船合同，日本各造船厂在6月底的订货单又比3月底减少了三十五万吨。
    造船订货的锐减和资金枯竭使不少造船厂纷纷倒闭。到了7月中旬，倒闭的造船厂已经增加到十家，还有十家船厂也将在几个月内倒闭。据日本造船协会估计，甚至在二十四家大造船厂的六十五只船台中，目前已经有十几只没有定货作。到9月底还将有三十九只船台要闲起来。
    据统计，在日本的造船总吨数中，有70％到80％出口。去年日本出口船只总值达三亿四千五百万美元，占同年输出总额的12％。日本的经济界已经严重忧虑船只出口的剧减将为1958年度的整个输出计划带来严重的影响。
    日本资本主义赖以起家的纺织业也深深陷入危机中。
    为了缓和生产过剩的危机，日本纺织业已经把开工率平均缩减了30％。棉纱产量已经从1957年的每月平均一亿磅降低到目前的七千三百万磅。但是，尽管如此，到本月中旬，棉纱的库存量还是超过了正常库存额的30％到40％。人造纤维的情况比棉纱还要严重，它的库存量达到正常库存量的两倍半。
    严重的危机首先逼垮了中小纺织企业。据中小企业厅调查，到6月底为止，已经有四百二十七家中小厂商倒闭，亏空额达一百一十亿日元。预料倒闭之风还要继续蔓延和扩大。面对着这种情况，拥有一万七千家纺织工厂的大阪、名古屋、静冈县、爱知县、兵库县等地方的厂商代表不久前在东京举行了“克服危机大会”，决定从8月起把开工率普遍从缩减30％提高到50％。共同社说，日本纺织业缩减生产达到这样程度，在战后还是第一次。
