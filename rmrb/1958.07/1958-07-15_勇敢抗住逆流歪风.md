    Bravely Resist the Adverse Current and Evil Winds
    Yi Huai
    When we encourage people to break superstitions and make achievements, we say that we must dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to be original. So many uses of the word "dare" show that creating and innovating requires great courage. This courage includes boldly solving many problems that one's own experience and knowledge cannot easily solve, and being prepared to experience dozens or even hundreds of failures; it also includes resisting adverse currents and standing up to evil winds, and not being afraid of "glorious isolation" for adhering to the truth.
    Our Party and state provide the best environment and conditions for the growth and development of all new things, and for the development and dissemination of truth. However, this does not mean that the growth of new things will no longer encounter any obstacles and difficulties. People's superstitions are still very deep. When someone is working on a new creation or proposing a new idea, there will be people shaking their heads and disapproving. Some say that what foreigners haven't done, Chinese people can't do; some say that what ancient people haven't done, modern people can't do; some say that what scholars and experts haven't proposed, ordinary people can't explore; some hold theories as dogmas to bind other people's hands and feet, some regard their own narrow experience as treasures and don't allow others to overstep it... The evil winds that hinder the growth of new things mostly blow out from here. If you insist on trying what others say is impossible, you will inevitably be considered as reckless, arrogant, and blamed for pursuing personal fame and gain, and so on.
    If you can't resist the adverse current and evil winds, you can't stick to the truth and you can't achieve innovation and creation. To be able to resist the adverse current and evil winds, it is difficult and not difficult. The distinction between difficult and not difficult depends on whether a person has selfishness and whether he can completely disregard personal gains and losses. If you can, you can stand firm and fearless even under the pressure of a force eight typhoon; if you can't, you will be blown around and unable to stand firm even by a small breeze of force two or three. Zhang Guangyi, a peasant inventor and creator and a Communist Party member who was hired as a special researcher at the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, can be described as a fearless person who can withstand the adverse current and evil winds. When he started to create tools for building reservoirs and had not succeeded after many experiments, he really encountered a force eight typhoon. Everyone said that he was acting recklessly and wasting the commune's property. As a result, his positions as Party branch secretary and commune committee member were revoked; his wife wanted a divorce and left the children to return to her parents' home; when he came home late from experiments at night, his family closed the door and would not let him in... These blows and setbacks did not shake Zhang Guangyi's determination. Where did Zhang Guangyi get such great courage? He himself said it well: "I am engaged in invention and creation to improve production and build socialism. I have no crooked thoughts." This is absolutely right. As the saying goes, "A clear conscience fears no midnight knock." Since one is wholeheartedly for the Party and the people, one can be ashamed of nothing in the face of any criticism from others, and one has the courage to be "gloriously isolated" without wavering. Because, as long as it is truly for the Party and the people, right and wrong will eventually be distinguished, and isolation will only be temporary. What's more, since personal gains and losses are disregarded, what is there to fear from dismissal, accusations, cold ridicule...?

    勇敢抗住逆流歪风
    易槐
    我们鼓舞人们破除迷信有所作为的时候，说是要敢想、敢说、敢做、敢独创。用了这么多“敢”字，可见要创造革新就需要有极大的勇气。这勇气，包括着大胆地解决许许多多自己的经验和知识所不易解决的问题，和准备经历几十次乃至几百次的失败；还包括抗逆流顶歪风，不害怕为坚持真理而“光荣的孤立”。
    我们的党和国家为一切新生事物的生长壮大、为真理的发展和传播安排下最好的环境和条件。但是，这决不是说，新事物的成长就不会再遇到什么障碍和困难了。人们的迷信还很深。有人在琢磨一种新创造或者提出一种新主张，旁边就会有人在那儿摇头晃脑不以为然。或谓外国人没有干过的中国人那能干成，或谓古人没有干过的今人那能干得了，或谓学者专家没有提出的普通人岂能问津；有人手捧理论当做教条来束缚别人的手足，有人把自己的狭隘经验奉为至宝不许别人逾越一步……。阻碍新事物生长的歪风也就大多从这里吹出。别人说办不到，你偏要试试看，这就不免要被认为是胡作非为、狂妄自大，被责备为追逐个人名利等等。
    抗不住逆流歪风，就坚持不了真理，搞不成革新创造。要抗得住逆流歪风，说难也难，说不难也不难。难与不难之分，就看一个人有没有私心，能不能把个人得失完全置之度外。能，就是在八级台风的压力下，也可以屹立不动无所畏惧；不能，那怕是二三级的小风，也会被吹得东摇西摆站不稳脚跟。被聘为农业机械研究所特约研究员的农民发明创造家、共产党员张广义，就可称得起是顶得住逆流歪风的无所畏惧的人。当他开始创造修建水库用的工具试验多次还没有成功的时候，他可真是碰到了八级台风。大家说他是胡作非为，浪费了社里的财产。于是，他的党支部书记和社务委员的职务被撤销了；老婆闹着要离婚，丢下孩子回娘家去了；夜里搞试验回家晚了，家人关上门不许回家……。这些打击和挫折并没有动摇了张广义的决心。张广义从那里来的这么大的勇气？他自己说得好：“我搞发明创造是为了搞好生产，建设社会主义，我没有什么歪思想”。这话对极了。俗话说：“为人不作亏心事，半夜敲门心不惊。”自己既然全心全意为党为人民，就可以在别人的任何责难面前毫无愧色，就有勇气“光荣的孤立”而不动摇。因为，只要真是为党为人民，是非终有一天会分清的，孤立也就只是暂时的。更何况，既然把个人得失置之度外，撤职、责难、冷讽热嘲……，又有什么可怕？
