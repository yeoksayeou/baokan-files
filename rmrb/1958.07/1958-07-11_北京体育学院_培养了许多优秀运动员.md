    Cultivating Many Outstanding Athletes
    Since last year, several pieces of good news have been reported internationally about Chinese athletes breaking world records. Most of these people who have won honor for the country are students of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. For example, Chen Jingkai, who created the world record of 139.5 kilograms in the clean and press in the lightest weight class; Qi Lieyun, who created the world record of one minute and eleven point six seconds in the 100-meter breaststroke in international swimming competitions; and Zheng Fengrong, who created the world record of 1.77 meters in the women's high jump, are all students of the sports department of the Institute of Physical Education. Guo Keyu, Qi Yufang, athletes who are participating in the 14th World Gymnastics Championships in Moscow and have won great acclaim in women's uneven bars and balance beam, as well as Bao Naijian, a male parallel bars athlete, and Xu Renjie, a horizontal bar athlete, are also students of the gymnastics class of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education.
    The Beijing Institute of Physical Education is a higher education institution that cultivates teachers, coaches, and sports professionals with socialist consciousness, sports knowledge, and high-level sports skills. It has two departments: physical education and sports. The sports department has majors in gymnastics, track and field, swimming, basketball, and volleyball. Since its establishment in 1953, the school has trained 2,000 sports cadres for the country. Recently, in accordance with the方針 of education serving politics and the combination of education and labor, a new teaching plan has been formulated. Students who come here to study, in addition to learning professional knowledge about sports, must also study political theory courses and engage in certain physical labor. In terms of sports professional courses, the school will also vigorously improve students' sports skills and refereeing skills. All graduates next year must meet the standards of a third-level athlete, of which 10% must reach the standards of a first-level athlete, and 3% must become sports masters.

    北京体育学院
    培养了许多优秀运动员
    去年以来，国际上传出了几起我国运动健将打破世界纪录的捷报，这些为国家争得了荣誉的人大多数是北京体育学院的学生。如创造最轻级平举139.5公斤世界纪录的陈镜开、在国际游泳赛中以一分十一秒六创造一百公尺蛙泳世界纪录的戚烈云、在跳高上创造女子跳高1.77公尺世界纪录的郑凤荣等人，都是体育学院运动系的学生。现在正在莫斯科参加第十四届世界体操锦标赛，而获得了很大好评的女子高低杠、平衡木等方面的运动员郭可愚、戚玉芳，以及男子双杠运动员鲍乃健，单杠运动员徐仁杰等人也都是北京体育学院体操班的学生。
    北京体育学院是一所培养具有社会主义觉悟、具有体育运动知识和较高的运动技术的教师、教练和体育专业干部的高等学校。它设有体育和运动两个系，在运动系里设有体操、田径、游泳、篮球、排球等专业。这个学校从1953年成立以来，已经为国家培养了两千名体育干部。最近按照教育为政治服务、教育和劳动结合的方针，制订了新的教学计划。来到这里学习的学生，除了学习有关体育的专业知识外，还必须学习政治理论课，从事一定的体力劳动。在体育专业课方面，也将大力提高学生的运动技术水平和裁判水平，明年的毕业生全部要达到三级运动员的标准，其中还要有10％的人达到一级运动员的标准，3％的人成为运动健将。
