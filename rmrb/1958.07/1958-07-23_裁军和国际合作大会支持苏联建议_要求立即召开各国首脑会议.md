Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 20th - The Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress continued its plenary session today after a day and a half of committee and subcommittee meetings. Many delegates spoke at the meeting, condemning the US-British imperialist armed aggression in the Middle East.

Dr. Abdul Rahman Shukr, the representative of Jordan, said in his speech that the US imperialists sent troops to land in Lebanon today, and fully cooperated with the British who sent troops to land in Jordan, thus exposing their faces and showing their true nature to the world. The historic resolution you passed condemning this aggression and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Middle East will surely inspire the courage and confidence of our people. It will also inspire us to work harder to liberate our country and to eliminate all the garbage and evils of imperialism in our country.

The head of the Egyptian delegation, Mohamed Kamel Ben Dary, said: "I ask you to recall the great Chinese revolution and the situations in the Korean War and the Indochina War! In all these events, the people of various countries, almost empty-handed, brought the armed aggression policy of the United States and its allies to a shameful defeat."

He said, "The characteristic of our era is the demise of the colonial system, which has given way to the liberation and independence of the people of all countries."

Dr. Ahmed Ben Milad, the representative of Tunisia, condemned the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan in his speech.

The head of the Japanese delegation, Yoshitaro Hirano, said that the United States should follow the example of the People's Republic of China and withdraw their troops from South Korea. The Japanese peace movement believes that one of its most important tasks is to establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China. He said that the Japanese delegation welcomed Guo Moruo's speech.

Before the adjournment at noon, the conference passed a resolution supporting Khrushchev's proposal for an immediate summit conference to discuss the Middle East situation caused by US-British military intervention. The resolution stated that in this extremely serious international situation, the Disarmament and International Cooperation Congress demands an immediate meeting of heads of state to prevent armed conflict and seek solutions through negotiation.

    裁军和国际合作大会支持苏联建议
    要求立即召开各国首脑会议
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩20日电  裁军和国际合作大会在进行了一天半的委员会和小组委员会会议后，今天继续举行全体会议。会上许多代表发言，谴责美英帝国主义在中东的武装侵略行动。
    约旦代表阿卜杜勒·拉赫蒙·舒克尔博士在发言中说，美帝国主义者今天派军队在黎巴嫩登陆，并且和派军队在约旦登陆的英国充分合作，这样它就暴露了自己的面貌，向全世界显出了他们的真正本质。你们通过的谴责这种侵略和要求一切外国军队立即撤出中东的历史性决议，一定会鼓舞我们的人民的勇气和信心。它也一定会激励我们更加努力来争取解放我们的国家、来争取把我们国家里的帝国主义的一切垃圾和邪恶扫除干净。
    埃及代表团团长穆罕默德·卡迈勒·本达里说：“我请你们回忆一下伟大的中国革命以及朝鲜战争和印度支那战争的情况吧！在所有这些事件中，几乎赤手空拳的各国人民使美国和它的盟国的武装侵略政策达到了可耻的失败。”
    他说，“我们时代的特征就是殖民制度的消逝，它已让给各国人民的解放和独立。”
    突尼斯代表艾哈迈德·本·米拉德博士在发言中谴责美国和英国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。
    日本代表团团长平野义太郎说，美国应当效法中华人民共和国，把他们的军队撤出南朝鲜。日本和平运动认为，它的最重大的任务之一是同中华人民共和国建立正常关系。他说，日本代表团欢迎郭沫若的发言。
    在中午休会前，大会通过了一项支持赫鲁晓夫的关于立即召开首脑会议讨论由于美英军事干涉而引起的中东局势的决议。决议说，在这极端严重的国际局势中，裁军和国际合作大会要求立即召开各国首脑的会议，以便防止武装冲突并通过谈判来求得解决。
