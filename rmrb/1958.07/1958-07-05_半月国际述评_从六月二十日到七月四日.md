    In the struggle against enemies attempting to undermine peace, national independence, and the socialist cause, the people of all countries have continued to make new progress. The criticism of modern revisionism has greatly contributed to strengthening the solidarity of the international communist movement. The Hungarian government's just action in executing the traitor Nagy was another powerful counterattack against the imperialist reactionary forces and their tool – modern revisionism. The insurgent people of Lebanon are valiantly resisting the imperialist conspiracy of armed intervention. The Indonesian government forces have recovered Manado and crushed the armed rebellion supported by the United States and other imperialists. However, imperialism, led by the United States, is by no means reconciled to defeat. In order to intensify the "Cold War" and international tensions, they are attempting to use the Nagy execution incident to stir up a new wave of anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment, trying every possible means to sabotage the convening of a summit conference, and stepping up the planning for military intervention in Lebanon.

          Just Sanctions

    The verdict of the People's Tribunal of the Hungarian Supreme Court against the traitor and counter-revolutionary criminal Nagy and his accomplices is something the Hungarian people have long awaited and greatly rejoiced over. This just judgment has been warmly supported by the broad masses of working people around the world.

    The judgment announcement by the Hungarian Ministry of Justice listed extensive and conclusive human and material evidence proving that the Nagy counter-revolutionary group colluded with foreign imperialist elements, playing a leading role in preparing and launching the counter-revolutionary riots; it also exposed the direct connection between the Nagy counter-revolutionary group and the Yugoslav revisionists. Therefore, this judgment further made people aware of imperialism's deep hatred and subversive conspiracy against peace and the socialist cause, and the reactionary face of modern revisionists.

    However, the matter has not ended there. The international reactionaries, led by the United States, were furious at the execution of the Nagy gang, attempting to take the opportunity to stir up another anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave. Eisenhower openly clamored that "what the United States must do now" is to "establish centrifugal forces" within the socialist camp. He also used this as a pretext for the United States to obstruct the summit conference. US Ambassador to the United Nations Lodge demanded that the notorious UN "Special Committee on the Hungarian Question" carry out slander and interference. With the open support of the US State Department, this committee immediately took action. At the same time, some of the Soviet Union's overseas representative offices were attacked by thugs. Britain and other follower nations also echoed the clamor, mobilizing propaganda organs and reactionary organizations to carry out slanderous propaganda. At this time, the Yugoslav revisionists further exposed their loyalty to imperialism. On June 23, the Yugoslav leadership group, in the name of the government, openly issued a "strongest protest" to the Hungarian government. The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published a mourning article and a photograph of the counter-revolutionary criminal Nagy, praising Nagy as an "outstanding figure."

    This is a replica of the anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave launched by imperialism after the Hungarian incident, and a continuation of the Yugoslav revisionists' shameful act of cooperating with imperialism to split the international communist movement.

    The imperialists and all reactionaries perform this series of anti-Soviet and anti-communist farces with ulterior motives. People vividly remember that the United States and other imperialists have used the Hungarian incident more than once to divert world public attention from their aggression in the Middle East. For example, in October 1956, taking advantage of the outbreak of the Hungarian incident, the imperialists launched an armed attack on Egypt; in September 1957, the United States used the UN "Committee of Five" to stir up an anti-Hungarian and anti-Soviet wave, intensifying its conspiracy to invade Syria; currently, it is trying to use the clamor about the Nagy case to cover up its active planning for armed intervention in Lebanon.

    However, for the imperialists and their tool, the revisionists, reality always ruthlessly shatters their subjective wishes. Doesn't the failure of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary riots prove that the imperialists' attempt to harm the powerful socialist camp, this fortress of peace, and the revisionists' attempt to collude with the imperialists to restore capitalism, is a fantasy that will never be realized?

          Rising Sun and Setting Sun

    If the imperialists stubbornly refuse to admit that the Western sun is setting and the Eastern sun is rising, and the revisionists stubbornly pin their hopes on the West, then the actual situation will teach them a lesson. Recently, the economic leap forward in socialist camp countries and the deepening of the economic crisis in capitalist countries have made the situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind even more prominent.

    The Soviet Union's industrial production in the first quarter of this year increased by 11% compared to the same period last year. China's industrial output in May increased by as much as 46% compared to the same period last year. However, the United States' industrial production in the first five months of this year fell by 11.4% compared to the same period last year. In addition, the economic development of other socialist countries also forms a sharp contrast to the economic stagnation and decline of other capitalist countries. What does this peaceful economic competition between the two systems mean? This is something the imperialists are well aware of. It is no accident that Western newspapers are now widely watching the great practice of the resounding slogan of peaceful competition put forward by the Soviet Union and China. The uneasiness felt by the imperialists cannot be concealed. The Soviet Union's coal production will exceed that of the United States this year; wheat production has more than doubled that of the United States; sugar beets are about twice as much as the United States; it has left the United States behind in the production of animal fats; and milk production is approaching the level of the United States. Our country's summer grain production this year has increased by more than 35 billion catties. The total wheat production has surpassed the United States and jumped to second place in the world, second only to the Soviet Union. The development of the iron and steel, coal, chemical fertilizer and other sectors will soon leave Britain behind. Among them, the target put forward by the great leap forward in the steel industry: to achieve an annual output of 200 million tons of iron ore by 1960, which will be almost twice as high as the output of iron ore in the United States last year.

    Now, the lords of the United States and other major capitalist countries are anxiously waiting for the economic crisis to suddenly stop, like placing bets. Some bourgeois economists in the United States are trying their best to use seasonal changes to spread illusions. But illusions are, after all, illusions. Even bourgeois economists in the United States and the Joint Economic Committee of both houses of Congress admit that the further sharp decline in corporate investment and the continued deterioration of unemployment in the United States in the second half of the year will make its hope of getting rid of the crisis in the short term even more slim. At the same time, under the impact of the economic crisis in the United States, the economic deterioration of Western European countries has already begun. After three years of stagnation in British industrial production, it has been declining month by month since February this year. In May, Britain's steel output fell by nearly 16% compared to a year ago, falling to the lowest level in four years. Its exports are also declining. The number of unemployed has increased by one-third compared to the same month last year. Italy, which had a later economic recovery after the war and whose industrial production had just been rising not long ago, also began to reduce steel production in March. Its imports in the first quarter of this year have decreased by 13% compared to the same period last year, and exports have decreased by 3%. Even West Germany, whose economy has been rising for several years, has recently begun to decline in industrial production after stagnation. In May, its overall industrial production was lower than the levels of April this year and May last year. In addition, it should be mentioned that Japan's consecutive three months of sluggish export trade has recently worsened the economic crisis. The Kishi Nobusuke government is facing a situation of crisis persistence.

    The leap forward in the economies of socialist countries has placed the issue of strengthening fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation on the agenda. The meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance held in Moscow in May, and the ninth meeting of this committee held in Bucharest, are new signs of the development of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries. However, the deepening of the economic crisis in the capitalist world has intensified the contradictions between imperialist countries, especially between the United States and its allies, in the struggle for markets and spheres of influence, which cannot be concealed by any beautiful words of "friendship."

    The United States Continues to Obstruct Summit Conference

    Due to the United States' repeated obstruction, preparations for the summit conference have stalled. The Soviet government has made further efforts to promote the convening of a summit conference. In addition to submitting twelve proposals on the issues to be discussed at the summit conference on May 5, Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent letters to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, and France on June 11, asking them to immediately indicate whether they sincerely hoped to convene a summit conference.

    How to answer this question is a test of the West's sincerity. However, Eisenhower, Macmillan, and de Gaulle's replies to Khrushchev on July 2 evaded answering this question, which is of widespread concern to public opinion. The US and British replies still adhered to their regressive positions, insisting that the summit conference simultaneously discuss the issues they raised for the deliberate purpose of sabotaging the conference, such as the so-called "situation in Eastern Europe"; and Khrushchev had already pointed out that the Western countries' proposals were nothing more than "intending to bury the summit conference in its infancy." Therefore, the Western countries' replies once again exposed their conspiracy to delay and sabotage the summit conference.

    The US and British replies both clearly tried to shift the responsibility for obstructing the convening of the summit conference onto the Soviet Union, but this is not possible. The suggestions made by the Western countries recently in the preparations for the summit conference regarding the agenda of the summit conference and other documents submitted by these countries to the Soviet Union prove that they do not want to find an agreement, but rather to set obstacles for the summit conference. US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy openly admitted that the United States is not enthusiastic about convening a summit conference, proposing to replace the summit conference with other negotiation methods. In the eyes of the US ruling clique, if it were not for the pressure of world public opinion, it would not spend any effort on the summit conference issue at all.

    The United States' refusal to stop nuclear weapons testing after the Soviet Union set an example, while at the same time playing a double game with the meeting of nuclear problem experts from the East and West, is also proof that it is unwilling to ease tensions. This expert meeting began in Geneva on July 1. The task of the meeting is to study what methods to use to detect possible violations once an agreement to stop nuclear testing is reached. However, the Soviet Union and the United States have completely different attitudes towards this meeting. The Soviet Union stated from the beginning that its agreement to participate in this meeting was in the hope that the meeting would enable countries possessing nuclear weapons to reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear explosion tests; while the attitude of the United States is to try its best to deny that the expert meeting should have this purpose, attempting to use the expert meeting to cover up the United States' policy of continuing nuclear weapons testing. On the same day that the expert meeting was held, Dulles also threatened at a press conference that if "the technical meeting is transformed into a political meeting," the United States would consider "what actions to take." This is obviously Dulles laying an ambush to sabotage the expert meeting, so that he can use the change in the nature of the meeting as an excuse to sabotage the meeting when he deems it necessary.

    Be Vigilant Against the US Playing-with-Fire Conspiracy in Lebanon

    In the past two weeks, the United States and Britain have continued to step up preparations for armed intervention in Lebanon. Signs from all sides indicate that the interveners are carrying out conspiratorial activities simultaneously in three aspects: one is that US and British troops will land directly in Lebanon wearing the "uniform" of the United Nations; the second is to use the vassal troops of the Iraq-Jordan Federation to attack; and the third is that US and British troops will openly carry out naked intervention.

    On June 18, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld left New York for Beirut, returning to New York on the 26th, having detoured through Cairo before returning, and held talks with the authorities of the United Arab Republic. During this period, the issue of establishing a so-called UN "police force" became the focus of discussion in Washington and Beirut. Dulles openly stated that if the United Nations sent a "police force" to Lebanon, the United States would also be prepared to send troops to participate. The Chamoun clique is also echoing the clamor, demanding that the "police force" enter Lebanon. However, the authority to send a UN "police force" lies with the Security Council, and since the Soviet Union can use its veto power, the US and British conspiracy will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, while clamoring for sending a UN "police force," the United States and Britain have also stepped up the conspiracy to use the troops of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation and US and British troops to carry out intervention.

    On June 23, Said, the Prime Minister of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, who is known as Britain's "most loyal friend" in the Middle East, arrived in London and discussed the plan to intervene in Lebanon with the US and British sides. Western newspapers attached great importance to Said's trip. The Paris newspaper "Le Monde" bluntly pointed out: Using the troops of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, "taking the form of a dispute between the two groups in the Arab world" to carry out intervention can divert the attention of Middle Eastern public opinion. According to the decisions of the secret talks, a large number of US Air Force transport planes have been assembled in West Germany awaiting orders, ready to be dispatched at any time to airlift Iraqi and Jordanian troops to Beirut. The troops of Iraq and Jordan are also moving towards the border.

    In addition, the United States and Britain are also actively preparing for direct armed intervention. The forces gathered by the two countries in the Eastern Mediterranean have been constantly increasing recently. The US Marine Corps in South Carolina is on standby, ready to go to Lebanon at any time. Dulles openly announced at a press conference on July 1: If the actions of the United Nations do not yield results, the United States may send its armed forces to Lebanon. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining even clamored that the United States is prepared to wage all-out war or limited war in Lebanon.

    However, the intervention activities of the United States, Britain, and their servants have not been able to intimidate the heroic Lebanese people. Despite the Chamoun clique's mad suppression with aircraft, warships, and heavy artillery under the direct support of the United States and Britain, the insurgent armed forces have still developed. At present, three-quarters of the country is controlled by the insurgent people. The unity and cooperation between the leaders of the main opposition parties has also been further strengthened. They have repeatedly declared: If the imperialist and their servant troops land to intervene, the people of Lebanon will rise up and fight.

    The US and British intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs and their playing-with-fire activities in the Middle East have aroused the public outrage of the people of the Middle East and the peace-loving people of the world. The United Arab Republic stated that if the United States and Britain send troops to intervene, the people of the United Arab Republic will send their own volunteer army to fight side by side with the peaceful people of Lebanon. On June 29, the spokesman of the Information Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned the United States and Britain: "If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression in Lebanon and the Arab region, they will inevitably be resolutely counterattacked by the peace-loving people of the world." The statement of the Soviet TASS news agency also stated that "the Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the foreign conspiracy to interfere in Lebanon, no matter what is used to cover up this interference." The Lebanese people's just struggle is not isolated.

    半月国际述评
    从六月二十日到七月四日
    各国人民在反对企图破坏和平、民族独立和社会主义事业的敌人的斗争中，继续取得了新的进展。对现代修正主义的批判，大大有利于加强国际共产主义运动的团结。匈牙利政府处决叛国罪犯纳吉的正义行动，是对帝国主义反动势力及其工具——现代修正主义的又一有力的反击。黎巴嫩起义人民正在英勇地抗击着帝国主义的武装干涉阴谋。印度尼西亚政府军收复了万鸦老，击溃了在美国和其他帝国主义支持下的武装叛乱。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义决不甘心。它们为了加剧“冷战”和国际紧张局势，企图利用纳吉伏法事件煽起一个反苏反共的新浪潮，千方百计地破坏高级会议的召开，加紧策划在黎巴嫩的军事干涉。
          正义的制裁
    匈牙利最高法院人民法庭对叛徒、反革命罪犯纳吉和他的帮凶的判决，是匈牙利人民等待已久、大快人心的事情。这一正义的裁判，获得了全世界广大劳动人民的热烈支持。
    匈牙利司法部的判决公告，列举广泛的确凿的人证物证，证明了纳吉反革命集团与外国帝国主义分子同谋，在准备和发动反革命暴乱中起了领导作用；同时也暴露了纳吉反革命集团同南斯拉夫修正主义者的直接联系。因此，这一判决进一步使人们认识到帝国主义对和平和社会主义事业的刻骨仇恨和颠复阴谋，认识到现代修正主义者的反动面目。
    但是，事情还没有到此结束。以美国为首的国际反动派对纳吉一伙被处决狂怒不堪，企图乘机又一次煽起反苏反共浪潮。艾森豪威尔公开叫嚷，“美国现在要做的”是在社会主义阵营“内部建立离心力量”。他并借此替美国阻挠高级会议找寻口实。美国驻联合国代表洛奇要求臭名远扬的联合国“匈牙利问题特别委员会”进行污蔑和干涉。在美国国务院的公开支持下，这个委员会就立即行动起来。与此同时，苏联的某些驻外代表机构遭到了暴徒的袭击。英国和其他国家的随从们也都齐声叫喊，动员宣传机关和反动组织进行污蔑宣传。在这时候，南斯拉夫修正主义者效忠于帝国主义的面目进一步暴露。6月23日，南斯拉夫领导集团以政府名义，公然向匈牙利政府提出“最强硬的抗议”。南斯拉夫“战斗报”并发表哀悼文章，刊登反革命罪犯纳吉的照片，把纳吉赞扬为“杰出人物”。
    这是匈牙利事件后帝国主义发动反苏反共浪潮的翻版，也是南斯拉夫修正主义者配合帝国主义分裂国际共产主义运动的可耻行为的继续。
    帝国主义者和一切反动派表演这种一系列的反苏反共的丑剧，具有不可告人的目的。人们记忆犹新，美国和其他帝国主义者曾经不止一次地利用匈牙利事件来转移世界公众对它侵略中东的注意。如1956年10月利用匈牙利事件的暴发，帝国主义者对埃及发动了武装进攻；1957年9月美国利用联合国“五人委员会”掀起反匈反苏的浪潮，加紧了对叙利亚的侵略阴谋；目前它又想利用对纳吉案件的叫嚣，掩盖它积极策划对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。
    但是，对帝国主义者及其工具修正主义者来说，现实总是无情地粉碎了它们的主观愿望。匈牙利反革命暴乱的失败，不正是证明：帝国主义者妄想损害强大的社会主义阵营这个和平堡垒，修正主义者妄想与帝国主义者里应外合复辟资本主义，是永远实现不了的幻想吗？
          旭日和斜阳
    如果帝国主义者硬要不承认西方的斜阳正在下坠而东方则旭日初升，修正主义者硬要把自己的前途指望着西方，那末，实际局势是会教训他们的。最近以来，社会主义阵营国家经济的跃进和资本主义国家经济危机的深刻化，已使东风压倒西风的形势更为突出了。
    苏联今年第一季的工业生产，比去年同期提高了11％。中国5月份工业产量比去年同期增加达46％。而美国今年头五个月的工业生产却比去年同期下跌11.4％。此外，其他社会主义国家经济的发展也同其他资本主义国家经济的停滞和下降，同样形成尖锐的对照。两种制度间的这种和平经济竞赛意味着什么，这是帝国主义所深知的。现在，西方报刊正广泛地注视着苏联和中国提出的响亮的和平竞赛口号的伟大实践，并不是偶然的。帝国主义感到的不安是无法掩盖的。苏联的煤产量在今年就将超过美国；小麦产量已超过美国一倍多；甜菜约比美国多两倍；在动物油脂的产量上已把美国抛在后面；牛奶产量已接近美国的水平。我国今年夏粮增产三百五十多亿斤。小麦总产量已超过美国而跃居世界第二位，仅次于苏联。钢铁、煤炭、化学肥料等部门的发展，很快就要把英国抛在后面。其中钢铁工业大跃进所提出的指标：1960年要达到年产铁矿石两亿吨，这就要比去年美国铁矿石的产量差不多高出一倍。
    现在，美国和其他主要资本主义国家的老爷们，正在像押赌注一样，焦急地等待着经济危机会突然中止。美国一些资产阶级经济学者竭力企图利用季节性的变化，散布幻想。但幻想终究是幻想。连美国资产阶级经济学者和国会的两院经济联合委员会都承认，下半年美国各企业投资的进一步锐减和失业状况的继续恶化，将使它在短期内摆脱危机的希望更加渺茫。同时，在美国经济危机的冲击下，西欧各国经济的恶化已经开始。英国工业生产在经过三年的停滞以后，从今年2月起已在逐月下降。5月份英国钢产量比一年前下降了将近16％，落到了四年中的最低水平。它的出口也在下降。失业人数已比去年同月增加了三分之一。战后经济恢复较迟、不久前工业生产刚在上升的意大利，3月份钢铁工业也开始减产。它今年第一季度的进口已比去年同期下降了13％，出口下降了3％。即使几年来经济一直上升的西德，工业生产最近也已开始由停滞而转向下降。5月份它的整个工业生产已低于今年4月和去年5月的水平。此外还应该提到的是日本，最近它的连续呆滞三个月的出口贸易，使经济危机更恶化了。岸信介政府已面临着危机持久性的局面。
    社会主义各国经济的跃进，使得它们加强兄弟般互助合作的问题提到日程上了。5月在莫斯科举行的经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党的代表会议，和在布加勒斯特举行的这个委员会的第九次会议，就是发展社会主义国家经济互助合作的新标志。而资本主义世界经济危机的加深，却使帝国主义国家间、特别是美国和它的盟国间争夺市场和势力范围的矛盾日趋尖锐化，这是任何漂亮的“友谊”言词所不能掩盖的。
    美国继续阻挠最高级会议
    由于美国的百般阻挠，高级会议的准备工作停滞不前。苏联政府为了促成召开高级会议，再次作了努力。除在5月5日提出关于高级会议讨论的问题的十二项建议以外，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在6月11日致函美、英、法三国首脑，要求它们立即表明它们是否真诚希望召开最高级会议。
    怎样回答这个问题，是对西方的诚意的考验。但是，艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐7月2日分别对赫鲁晓夫的复信，竟对这个公众舆论普遍关心的问题避而不答。美英的复信仍然坚持它们的倒退的立场，硬要高级会议同时讨论它们为蓄意破坏会议而提出的问题，如所谓“东欧局势”问题；而赫鲁晓夫已经指出，西方国家提出的这类问题不过是“打算在萌芽状态就把高级首脑会议埋葬”。因此，西方国家的复信，再度暴露出它们拖延和破坏最高级会议的阴谋。
    美英的复信都明显地竭力企图把它阻挠召开高级会议的责任推到苏联身上，但这是办不到的。西方国家最近在高级会议的准备工作中提出的关于高级会议议程的建议和这些国家交给苏联的其他文件，证明了它们并不希望找寻协议，而是替高级会议设置障碍。美国副国务卿帮办墨菲公开承认美国对召开高级会议并不热心，提出要以其他谈判方式来代替高级会议。在美国统治集团看来，如果不是由于世界舆论的压力，它是根本不会在高级会议问题上花费精力的。
    美国拒绝在苏联作出榜样后停止核武器试验，同时又对东西方核问题专家会议玩弄两面手法，这也是它不愿缓和紧张局势的证明。这个专家会议已于7月1日在日内瓦开始举行。会议的任务是研究一旦达成停止核试验的协定后要用什么方法来侦察可能的违约行为的问题。但苏联和美国对待这个会议的态度是截然不同的。苏联一开始就表明，它同意参加这个会议是希望会议会使拥有核武器国家就停止核爆炸试验问题达成协议；而美国的态度，则竭力否定专家会议应具有这个目的，企图利用专家会议来掩盖美国继续进行核武器试验的政策。就在专家会议举行的同一天，杜勒斯还在记者招待会上威胁说，如果“把技术性会议转变成政治会议”，美国就要考虑“采取什么行动”。这显然是杜勒斯为破坏专家会议设下埋伏，以便他认为必要时就以会议性质改变为借口，破坏会议。
    警惕美国在黎巴嫩的玩火阴谋
    近两周来，美英两国继续加紧准备对黎巴嫩进行武装干涉。各方面的迹象说明，干涉者正在从三个方面同时进行阴谋活动：其一是，美英军队穿上联合国的“号衣”直接在黎巴嫩登陆；其二是，利用伊拉克—约旦联邦的仆从军进攻；其三是，美英军队公开进行赤裸裸的干涉。
    6月18日，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德离纽约前往贝鲁特，26日返回纽约，行前曾绕道开罗，和阿拉伯联合共和国当局进行会谈。在这段期间，建立所谓联合国“警察部队”的问题，成为华盛顿和贝鲁特的议论中心。杜勒斯公开表示，如果联合国派“警察部队”去黎巴嫩，美国也准备派军队参加。夏蒙集团也在随声叫嚷，要求“警察部队”开入黎巴嫩。但是，派遣联合国“警察部队”的权限在于安全理事会，由于苏联可以使用否决权，美英的阴谋就很难得逞。因此，美英两国在叫嚷派遣联合国“警察部队”的同时，也加紧了利用伊约联邦军队和美英军队进行干涉的阴谋活动。
    6月23日，被称为英国在中东的“最忠实的朋友”的伊—约联邦首相赛义德到了伦敦，和英美方面讨论干涉黎巴嫩的计划。西方报刊对于赛义德此行十分重视。巴黎“世界报”直率地指出：利用伊—约联邦军队，“采取阿拉伯世界的两个集团之间纠纷的形式”进行干涉，可以转移中东舆论的视线。根据秘密会谈的决定，大批美国空军运输机已集结西德待命，准备随时出动，空运伊、约军队到贝鲁特。伊拉克、约旦的军队也向边境移动。
    此外，美英两国也积极准备直接进行武装干涉。两国在东地中海集结的兵力最近仍在不断增加。美国南卡罗来纳州的海军陆战队待命随时开往黎巴嫩。杜勒斯在7月1日的记者招待会上公开宣布：如果联合国的行动没有结果的话，美国就有可能把它的武装部队派往黎巴嫩。美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁甚至叫嚣美国已准备在黎巴嫩进行全面战争或有限战争。
    但是，美英及其仆从的干涉活动并未能吓倒英勇的黎巴嫩人民。尽管夏蒙集团在美英直接支持下，使用飞机、军舰和重炮进行疯狂的镇压，起义武装力量仍然有了发展。目前，四分之三的国土已经为起义人民所控制。主要反对党领袖之间的团结合作也有了进一步加强。他们一再宣布：假如帝国主义及其仆从军队登陆干涉，黎巴嫩全国人民将奋起抗战。
    美英两国干涉黎巴嫩内政和在中东玩火的活动，已经激起了中东人民和世界和平人民的公愤。阿拉伯联合共和国表示，假如美英派军干涉，阿拉伯联合共和国人民将派出自己的志愿军，和黎巴嫩和平人民并肩战斗。6月29日，我国外交部新闻司发言人警告美英两国说：“如果帝国主义竟胆敢在黎巴嫩和阿拉伯地区发动侵略战争，就必将受到全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决反击”。苏联塔斯社的声明也表示“苏联这次对外国策划干涉黎巴嫩一事，不管这种干涉是用什么东西来掩饰的，也不能漠不关心”。黎巴嫩人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。
