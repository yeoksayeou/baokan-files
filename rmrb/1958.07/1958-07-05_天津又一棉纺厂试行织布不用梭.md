Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 3rd: Technicians Liu Zhenqi and Wang Zhibin, a cadre sent to work at the grassroots level, from the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, have successfully trial-produced a shuttleless loom. This loom has no shuttle, nor does it have a bobbin wound with weft yarn. It only has a small, lightweight iron weft inserter, with weft yarn attached at both ends. It uses electromagnetic pressure to move back and forth between the warp yarns, weaving the fabric. This loom is modified from an old "Niu Tian" type loom. Compared with shuttle looms, its advantages are reduced noise, no need to change shuttles, reduced yarn breakage rate, and avoidance of "flying shuttle injuries". At the same time, the weft yarn used in the shuttleless loom is large-package yarn, which can greatly reduce manual shuttle loading. The loom's revolutions can also be increased by one to three times compared to the current rate.

    天津又一棉纺厂试行织布不用梭
    据新华社天津3日电　国营天津第六棉纺织厂的技术员刘振起和下放干部王泽滨等四人试制成功无梭织布机。这种织布机，既不用梭，也没有缠着纬纱的纱管，它只有一个体积很小、分量很轻的铁制导纬器，两头牵了纬纱，利用电磁的压力，来回于经纱之间，织成布匹。这种织布机是用旧有的牛田式织布机改装的，和有梭织布机比较，它的优点是减少噪音、不换梭、断头率减少、避免“飞梭伤人”的事故。同时，无梭织布机用的纬纱是大筒纱，可以大大减少装梭人工，布机的转数也可以比目前增加一倍到三倍。
