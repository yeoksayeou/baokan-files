Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: Rome Dispatch: "Unità" published the Italian Communist Party's letter to the Italian people regarding the Middle East situation on the 16th. The full text is as follows:

    The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party condemns with extreme disgust the shameless and brutal aggression of the American imperialists against Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and the independence and freedom of the Arab people.
    Today, all Italian workers sympathize with and fully support the people of these countries, who are facing new and arduous trials and must therefore wage a heroic struggle for their national independence.
    American aggression, which violates all principles of respecting the freedom and independence of all nations and disregards the reports submitted by United Nations observers, is a grave threat of war to all Mediterranean countries, thereby endangering the vital interests of the Italian people and peace itself.
    The Communist Party reminds all Italians of the extreme seriousness of the situation and the threat of total war that the imperialists' actions pose to humanity. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party believes that our country's ports cannot be allowed to be used as a base for Anglo-American imperialist adventures. Italy cannot and should not be involved in this disastrous adventure in any way. It is in Italy's interest to defend peace, maintain friendship with the Arab world, and safeguard the independence of Arab countries.
    We demand that the Italian government strongly condemn this aggression, refuse American troops the use of our sea and air bases, and take immediate measures to stop imperialist intervention and ensure that the will and independence of the Arab people are respected.
    The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party appeals to all Italians, to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, especially women and young people, to recognize the grave threat they face and to hold demonstrations throughout the country against imperialist aggression, express solidarity with the peoples of the invaded countries, and strive for Italy to immediately propose a conference of the major powers.
    Communists stand at the forefront of the urgent popular mass action to defend peace.
    Imperialist aggressors, get out of Lebanon and the Middle East!
    Long live the Arab peoples fighting for national independence!
    Italy must take action to save peace in the Mediterranean and the world!

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 17th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement today condemning the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East and calling on the people to stop this adventure.

    The statement said: "British troops have entered Jordan. American troops have entered Lebanon. British armed forces are suppressing Lahej (Emirate). They are threatening the Republic of Iraq from all sides."
    The statement pointed out that this is only the beginning. Massive military mobilizations are already underway to suppress the Arab people's struggle for freedom.
    The statement condemned this as an act of aggression, "an aggression that uses force against the will of the people to maintain corrupt dictators in order to preserve the massive profits of American and British oil monopolies and their huge profits."
    The statement recalled how the British people and the people of the world united two years ago to force an end to the Suez invasion and pointed out: "Today, the need for an immediate and firm response is even more urgent than in the past."
    The statement also called on the Labour Party and the trade union movement to take action to oppose this criminal war of aggression and to lead and organize activities against it.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: TASS, Paris, July 17th: The Chairman of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, Duclos, and the Vice-Chairman, Rocher, issued the following statement today after meeting with the Speaker of the French National Assembly, Le Troquer:

    "We have requested an audience with Speaker Le Troquer in order to inform him of the following: Due to the extreme seriousness of the situation in the Near and Middle East, especially the consequences of the American armed intervention in Lebanon, and in view of the imperialists' intention to obstruct the massive liberation movements of the Iraqi people and other Arab countries, a grave danger has befallen our country.
    Not long ago, the de Gaulle government hinted that it was prepared to join the US-British troops in armed intervention in Lebanon. The French Communist Party parliamentary group has learned that the government has entrusted de Gaulle personally to make a decision on France's position on the Near and Middle East issue, and therefore it requests that the parliament convene an emergency meeting to discuss the Near and Middle East events and decide on France's policy on this issue."

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: TASS, Copenhagen, July 17th: "Land og Folk" reported that the Chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Larsen, and the Vice-Chairman, Jensen, wrote to the Danish Acting Prime Minister Jørgensen yesterday, pointing out that Denmark should condemn the US military actions in the Near East, both within the United Nations and the North Atlantic Alliance, and should strive to stop intervention and ensure world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: Brussels Dispatch: The Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party issued a statement entitled "Frustrate the Adventurous Policy of the Oil Trusts," condemning the US-British armed aggression against Middle Eastern countries.

    The statement said that the imperialist oil trusts sent troops to the Middle East, thereby once again bringing the world to the brink of war. The statement pointed out that it is criminal for Western imperialists to pursue such a policy.

    意共英共号召反对美英侵略
    法共要求召开议会紧急会议讨论中东事件
    新华社19日讯　罗马消息：“团结报”16日刊载意大利共产党就中东局势告意大利人民书。全文如下：
    意大利共产党中央委员会以极端厌恶的心情谴责美帝国主义者对黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克和阿拉伯人民的独立和自由的无耻和粗暴的侵略。
    今天，全体意大利劳动者同情并完全支持这些国家的人民，他们面临着新的和艰巨的考验，从而必须为他们的民族独立而进行英勇的斗争。
    违反一切尊重各国人民自由和独立的原则、而且无视联合国观察员所提出的报告的美国的侵略，是对所有地中海国家的严重的战争威胁，从而危害了意大利人民的切身利益以及和平本身。
    共产党提醒全体意大利人注意局势的极端严重性和帝国主义者的行动为人类带来的全面战争威胁。意大利共产党中央委员会认为不能容许把我国的港口作为英美帝国主义冒险行动的出发基地。意大利不能够、也不应该以任何方式卷入这种招致惨祸的冒险中去。意大利的利益所在是保卫和平、保持同阿拉伯世界的友谊、维护阿拉伯各国的独立。
    我们要求意大利政府有力地谴责这一侵略，拒绝美国军队使用我国的海、空基地，并立即采取措施，以制止帝国主义的干涉并使阿拉伯人民的意愿和独立受到尊重。
    意大利共产党中央委员会向全体意大利人，向一切工人、农民、知识分子、特别是妇女和青年们发出呼吁，以便使他们在认识到面临严重的威胁的情况下，在全国各地举行示威，反对帝国主义侵略，表示同被侵略的各国人民团结一致，争取意大利立即提出倡议，要求各大国举行会议。
    共产党员们站在拥护和平的紧急的人民群众行动的最前列。
    帝国主义侵略者从黎巴嫩和中东滚出去！
    为民族独立而斗争的阿拉伯各国人民万岁！
    意大利必须采取行动拯救地中海和全世界的和平！
    新华社伦敦17日电　英国共产党政治委员会今天发表声明，谴责英美两国在中东的侵略行动，并且要求人民制止这种冒险活动。
    声明说：“英国军队已经开入约旦。美国军队已经开进黎巴嫩。英国武装部队正在镇压拉赫杰（酋长国）。他们正在从各方面威胁伊拉克共和国。”
    声明指出，这一切只是开始。目前已经进行了规模巨大的军事调动以镇压阿拉伯人民争取自由的斗争。
    声明谴责说，这是侵略行动，“是违背人民的意志用武力来维持腐朽的独裁者以保持美英石油大垄断资本和它们的巨额利润的侵略”。
    声明追述了英国人民和世界各国人民在两年前团结起来迫使苏伊士侵略战争结束，并且指出：“今天，立即作出坚决的反应的需要，甚至比过去更加迫切。”
    声明还要求工党和工会运动采取行动去反对这种罪恶的侵略战争，并且领导和组织反对这种战争的活动。
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社巴黎17日讯：法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛和副主席罗歇今天在拜会法国国民议会议长勒特罗盖之后，发表了如下的声明：
    “我们请求勒特罗盖议长接见我们，为的是把如下的情况通知他：由于中近东的事态极端严重，特别是由于美国武装干涉黎巴嫩所造成的一切后果，同时鉴于帝国主义者打算阻挠伊拉克人民和其他阿拉伯各国人民的声势浩大的解放运动，严重的危险已经临到我国头上。
    不久以前戴高乐政府就曾暗示过，它准备同美英军队一道参加对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。法国共产党议会党团得知，政府已经委托戴高乐个人就法国对中近东的立场问题作出决定，因此它要求议会召开紧急会议，讨论中近东事件，并决定法国在这个问题上的政策。”
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社哥本哈根17日电：“国土与人民报”报道，丹麦共产党主席拉森和副主席任生昨天写信给丹麦代理首相约根森，指出，丹麦无论在联合国和北大西洋联盟内都应当谴责美国在近东的军事行动，并且应当竭力制止干涉和确保世界和平。
    新华社19日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党政治局发表了题为“挫败石油托辣斯的冒险政策”的声明。谴责美英武装侵略中东国家。
    声明说，帝国主义石油托辣斯派兵前往中东，从而再一次使全世界濒于战争灾难的边缘。声明指出，西方帝国主义者执行这种政策是犯罪的。
