Sweeping mines was the training task for yesterday. We swept until 2 AM before we went to bed. After a day and night of hard fighting, the mine sweeping personnel were very tired, but some people couldn't sleep in bed, and looked forward to the daybreak. This was the first mine sweeping training this year. After a day and a night of training, we achieved a good level or above, and sometimes even excellent. According to the business chief, such a result is already very good. However, our Great Leap Forward target is not only to achieve excellence, but also to exceed the excellent standard! The sailors are determined to complete the target and break through the target today.

It was finally dawn, and the wake-up call rang. The comrades jumped out of bed, washed their faces and ate quickly, and began a day of intense training.

As soon as the signal "This ship is preparing to sweep mines" was sent out, the sailors rushed to their posts like tigers descending the mountain, removing obstacles and preparing equipment. Although they didn't get enough sleep yesterday, there wasn't a trace of fatigue on anyone's face.

Today's wind and waves were even bigger than yesterday. So what if the wind and waves are big? The sailors' determination is greater than the wind and waves. Look, the large buoy that originally required two people to lift was carried by Ou Xi'an alone. Fan Cable Squad Leader Liu Jianwen, although he had no responsibility in this mine sweeping, still stood there to guide the new soldier Zheng Dachang's actions. Everything went smoothly. As long as it didn't rain, we were confident of completing the target.

Unfortunately, at this critical juncture, it started to rain, and it rained harder and harder. In a short while, everyone's clothes were soaked, and the cold wind blew, turning their lips blue. Originally, the raincoats were nearby, but everyone only thought about work, and who would be willing to waste time putting them on?

The ship's captain saw that the rain was getting heavier and prepared to stop temporarily, but was afraid that the comrades would not be willing, so he decided to ask for everyone's opinions. The comrades shouted in unison: "No! We will do it to the end!"
"We are not afraid of the enemy's guns and cannons, so what is a little rain!" "We will never stop until we exceed the target!" The political commissar immediately supported everyone and said: "Yes, the more complex the conditions, the more we must train. Who is a hero and who is a good man, we must compete now!" These words were like a raging fire thrown on barrels of gasoline, and the comrades' hearts were burning.

The rain was getting heavier, and the raindrops stung people's faces and hands like iron sand. The shoes were filled with water, and the wet clothes were tightly attached to the body, making it very inconvenient to lift hands and feet; the grease on the steel cables dripped down, and the deck was as slippery as a piece of glass, and one would fall if one slipped. But everyone's determination was greater than the wind and rain, and higher than the waves. If they fell, they would get up and continue working; if they couldn't open their eyes, they would grope and do it. When everyone saw that the ship's captain and the business chief were as soaked as everyone else, they felt even more strength. The sailors encouraged each other: "Today, we will compete with God to see who has more energy!"

After more than an hour of intense fighting, a miracle happened: the time to deploy the minesweeping gear, which yesterday could not consolidate the target, exceeded the target all at once today. Even the comrades who were watching the time suspected that the stopwatch was running slowly. The recovery time also greatly exceeded the requirements.

Wind and rain cannot scare the naval fighters, but gave us a chance to exercise. We have fulfilled our promise to exceed the target!

    风雨扫雷创奇迹
    罗起平
    昨天扫雷训练了一天，夜里又扫了半夜，直到下两点才去睡觉。经过一天一夜的苦战，扫雷人员都很累，但是有些人却躺在床上睡不着，眼睁睁地盼着天快亮，这是今年第一次的扫雷训练，经过一天一夜的训练，达到了良好以上的水平，有时还达到优秀。按照业务长的说法，能有这样的成绩已经很不错了。可是，我们的跃进指标不仅是达到优秀，还要超过优秀标准呵！水兵们决心要在今天完成指标，突破指标。
    好容易盼到天亮，起床哨响了，同志们从床上跳起来，匆匆洗脸吃饭，开始了一天紧张的训练。
    “本舰准备扫雷”的信号刚刚发出，水兵们一个个像猛虎下山，飞奔向自己的岗位，扫除障碍、准备器材。虽然昨天都没有睡够，可是在每个人的脸上，找不出丝毫疲倦的模样。
    今天的风浪比昨天还大。风浪大又算得了什么？水兵们的决心比风浪还大。你看，本来需要两个人抬的大浮标，欧锡安一个人扛起就跑了，帆缆班长刘建文虽然在这次扫雷中没有职责，他仍站在那里指导新战士郑大昌的动作。一切都进行得很顺利，只要不下雨，完成指标是有把握的。
    偏巧就在这个节骨眼上，下起雨来了，而且越下越大，不一会就淋湿了大家的衣服，冷风一吹，嘴唇都冻青了。本来，雨衣就在附近，可是大家一心只想到工作，有谁愿意耽误功夫去穿它呢？
    舰首长看到雨下大了，准备暂时停止，又怕同志们不愿意，决定征求一下大家的意见。同志们齐声喊起来：“不！我们要干到底！”
  “敌人的枪炮还不怕，这点雨算什么！”“不超过指标决不收兵！”政委立刻支持大家说：“对，越是条件复杂咱们越要练，谁是英雄谁是好汉，现在就要比比看！”这几句话好像一把烈火，投在一桶桶汽油上，同志们的心都燃烧起来了。
    雨下得更大了，雨点铁砂子似地刺得人脸上、手上生疼，鞋子里早灌满了水，湿漉漉的衣服紧贴着肉，抬手动脚很不方便；钢缆上的黄油都淌下来，甲板滑得像块玻璃，一滑就得摔一跤。可是大家的决心比风雨更大，比浪更高，跌倒了，爬起来再干；眼睁不开，摸索着干。当大家看到舰首长和业务长也和大家一样淋得浑身透湿，更增加了一股力量。水兵们互相鼓动着：“咱今天要跟老天爷比一比，看谁的干劲大！”
    经过一个多小时的紧张搏斗，奇迹出现了：投放扫雷具的时间，昨天还不能巩固指标，今天却一下子超过这指标。连看时间的同志都疑心秒表是不是走得慢了。收回的时间也大大超过要求。
    风雨吓不倒海军战士，倒给了我们一场锻炼的机会，我们要超过指标的诺言兑现了！
