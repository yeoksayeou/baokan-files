    Hainan Island Raises African Carp
    Last year, the Chinese fisheries delegation brought back a batch of African carp from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The fish fry farm of the Guangdong Hainan Administrative Office Fisheries Bureau trialed raising six of them. Now they have reproduced to tens of thousands.
    This is a type of tropical fish. Its characteristics are: fast growth rate, strong reproductive ability, can lay eggs in ponds, can live in fresh water and seawater (salinity of 30 to 40 parts per thousand), strong resistance, is an omnivorous fish, and breeding management is also very convenient. It is an ideal type of farmed fish in the tropics of Hainan Island. Currently, there is a lack of silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp, and common carp fry in Hainan Island, which cannot meet the needs of the masses for farming. To this end, the Hainan Administrative Office Fisheries Bureau will promote the breeding of this fish throughout the region, with a plan to achieve African carp in every commune by the end of the year.

    海南岛养非洲鲫鱼
    去年中国渔业代表团从越南民主共和国带回一批非洲鲫鱼，广东海南行署水产局鱼苗场试养了六尾。现在已繁殖到几万尾。
    这是一种热带鱼类。它的特点是：生长速度快，繁殖力强，能在池塘产卵，能生活在淡水和海水
  （盐度千分之三十至四十度）中，抵抗力强，是杂食鱼类，饲养管理也很方便，这是海南岛热带最理想的一种饲养鱼类。目前在海南岛鲢、鳙、鲩、鲤等鱼苗缺乏，不能满足群众饲养需要。为此，海南行署水产局将在全区推广繁殖这种鱼，计划到年底实现社社有非洲鲫鱼。
