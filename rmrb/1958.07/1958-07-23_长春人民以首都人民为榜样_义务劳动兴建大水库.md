Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 21st. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Xinlicheng Reservoir in Changchun City was grandly held at the construction site yesterday. It was built by the people of Changchun City, taking the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir by the people of the capital as an example. The scale of this reservoir is roughly the same as that of the Ming Tombs Reservoir.

Changchun City has a high terrain and insufficient water sources. During the second five-year plan, Changchun City will build and expand a large number of large, medium and small factories, and scientific research and cultural and educational undertakings will be greatly developed. This city will become a modern industrial and cultural city based on automobiles, steel, and machinery. This requires sufficient water sources to ensure the development of various construction undertakings in the city. After the completion of the Xinlicheng Reservoir, it can basically meet the needs of industrial and domestic water during the city's second five-year plan.

The people of Changchun City, taking the heroic behavior of the people of the capital in building the Ming Tombs Reservoir as an example, regard the Xinlicheng Reservoir as a school for carrying out communist labor training, and strive to complete the reservoir one year ahead of schedule before the flood season in the year after next using their own hands. All walks of life in the city are divided into ten voluntary labor brigades, with 10,000 people investing in construction every day. Each cadre in the provincial and municipal organs must work for twenty to thirty days a year.

### 长春人民以首都人民为榜样  义务劳动兴建大水库

    长春人民以首都人民为榜样
    义务劳动兴建大水库
    据新华社长春21日电  长春市新立城水库昨天在工地隆重举行了开工典礼。它是长春市人民学习首都人民建设十三陵水库的榜样而兴建的。这座水库的规模同十三陵水库大致相等。
    长春市地势较高，水源不足。在第二个五年计划期间，长春市要新建和扩建大批大中小型工厂，科学研究和文化教育事业将有很大发展，这个城市将成为一个以汽车、钢铁、机械为基础的现代化工业和文化城市。这就要求有足够的水源保证城市各项建设事业的发展。新立城水库建成以后，基本上可以满足全市第二个五年计划期间工业用水和生活用水的需要。
    长春市人民以首都人民建设十三陵水库的英雄行为作为榜样，把新立城水库当作进行共产主义劳动锻炼的学校，用自己的双手争取提前一年在后年汛期前建成这个水库。全市各行各业分成十个义务劳动大队，每天有一万人投入建设。省、市机关每个干部一年要劳动二十天到三十天。
