Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 9th. The US-Chiang elements in Hong Kong, under the guise of holding a so-called "International Commodity Exhibition," were engaged in political conspiracy activities to cooperate with the United States in creating "two Chinas." This plot has been crushed by Hong Kong compatriots on the 8th.

Under the pressure of public opinion from compatriots in all circles in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong British Police recently wrote to the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce," which is controlled by US-Chiang elements, stating that the so-called "International Commodity Exhibition" it was hosting was a political activity that jeopardized public order, and ordered it to shut down. After receiving the instruction from the police, the "Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce" had no choice but to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 8th and announce the cancellation of the so-called "exhibition," which was aimed at carrying out political conspiracy activities.

This so-called "International Commodity Exhibition" was originally scheduled to open on August 8. The US-Chiang elements planned to use sixty-four of the hundred or so stalls to create a so-called "China Pavilion," hanging up the Chiang gang's flag. A group of dirty fellows from Taiwan formed a so-called "Republic of China Industrial and Commercial Circles Participation in Hong Kong and Kowloon International Commodity Exhibition Committee" to prepare for this political conspiracy activity. Subsequently, a delegation controlled by a group of CC clique secret agents was formed, calling itself the "Republic of China Industrial and Commercial Circles Participation in Hong Kong and Kowloon International Commodity Exhibition" delegation, preparing to come to Hong Kong for activities in the near future. After the political conspiracy of the US-Chiang elements was exposed by Hong Kong newspapers, it was strongly condemned by people from all walks of life in Hong Kong. Many people in the industrial and commercial circles, workers, film circles, and cultural circles publicly expressed their opinions, expressing great anger at the conspiracy activities of the US-Chiang elements. Under the united and resolute struggle of Hong Kong compatriots for the unification of the motherland, this political conspiracy activity, which the US-Chiang elements had been preparing for for several months, was finally crushed.

    在香港各界同胞舆论的压力下
    美蒋分子的政治阴谋终被粉碎
    所谓“国际商品展览会”不得不被迫停办
    新华社香港9日电  香港美蒋分子以举办所谓“国际商品展览会”名义，来配合美国制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋活动，已经在8日被香港同胞粉碎了。
    在香港各界同胞舆论的压力下，香港英国警务处最近写信给由美蒋分子把持的“九龙总商会”，认为它主办的这个所谓“国际商品展览会”是一种有碍治安的政治活动，要它停办。“九龙总商会”在接到警务处的指令以后，不得不在8日举行理事和监事联席会议上，宣布把这个以进行政治阴谋活动为目的的所谓“展览会”停办。
    这个所谓“国际商品展览会”原定在8月8日开幕。美蒋分子准备在一百多个小摊位中，用六十四个小摊位搞一个所谓“中国馆”，挂起蒋帮旗帜。由台湾的一批肮脏的家伙组成了一个所谓“中华民国工商界参加港九国际商品展览会委员会”，来筹办这个政治阴谋活动。随后，又组成了一个由一批CC系特务分子控制的所谓“中华民国工商界参加港九国际商品展览会”代表团，准备在短期内前来香港活动。美蒋分子的这个政治阴谋被香港报纸揭发以后，受到香港各界人士的强烈谴责，许多工商界人士、工人、电影界和文化界人士都公开发表谈话，对美蒋分子的阴谋活动表示极大的愤怒。在香港同胞团结一致为祖国的统一而进行坚决的斗争下，美蒋分子筹备了几个月的这个政治阴谋活动终于被粉碎。
