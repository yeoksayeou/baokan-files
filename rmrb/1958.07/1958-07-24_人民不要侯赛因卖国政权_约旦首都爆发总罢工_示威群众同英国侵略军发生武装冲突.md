Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 22nd: According to a broadcast by the Iraqi Republic Radio on the evening of the 21st, a general strike broke out in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the 21st.

Jordanian King Hussein, distrusting the Jordanian army, has requested British interventionist troops to suppress demonstrations by the people in various parts of Jordan. In some places, British troops and demonstrators have clashed.

According to travelers arriving in Cyprus from Amman on the 21st, explosions occurred outside the residences of two Jordanian ministers on the evening of the 20th. These two ministers are in favor of the presence of British troops in Jordan.

In order to suppress the increasingly strong opposition from the Jordanian people against the British aggression and the Hussein puppet dynasty, Hussein has ordered tanks and armored vehicles to be deployed at the entrances to Amman and at intersections on the roads leading to Amman. British aggressor troops are patrolling in Amman and in traffic centers near Amman.

Hussein has also hurriedly promulgated a decree stipulating the death penalty for anyone deemed to be involved in a "conspiracy" to assassinate the king or overthrow the government. Previously, such individuals were sentenced to imprisonment for no more than fifteen years.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 23rd: The Damascus newspaper "Al-Jamahir" published a report from Amman today stating that Jordanian King Hussein is in consultation with Iran, Turkey, Britain, and the United States, attempting to incorporate Jordan into the already crumbling Baghdad Pact.

Hussein is attempting to consolidate his tottering dynasty in this way and act as a pawn for US-British expansionist activities in the Middle East.

Meanwhile, according to a broadcast by Israeli Radio this morning, British Commander-in-Chief of Ground Forces in the Middle East, Bower, held talks in Amman on the 22nd with Hussein and the British Ambassador to Jordan. Bower traveled to Amman from Cyprus on the same day. In addition, news has emerged that the British Middle East Air Force Commander, Patch, also hurriedly visited Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: Amman dispatch: In the face of the Jordanian people's anger, British aggressor soldiers are trembling with fear. After officials of the Hussein puppet dynasty reported that someone was going to kill a British paratrooper, they have been even more nervous since last night, strengthening their guard, even when taking evening walks in Amman, they must be in groups of four and carry weapons. According to a report in the Damascus newspaper "Al-Yaum" on the 22nd, Jordanian authorities sealed the Jordan-Syria border on the evening of the 21st. Jordanian authorities have banned 150 trucks carrying wheat from entering Jordan.

The large-scale presence of British troops has exacerbated the oil shortage in Jordan. Jordan now consumes 1,000 tons of oil per day, but despite the best efforts of the US military to airlift oil into Jordan, only 500 tons can be delivered per day. The amount of oil available for civilian use has been drastically reduced. As a result, most motorized transportation has been suspended, and people are lining up to buy oil under police supervision.

    人民不要侯赛因卖国政权
    约旦首都爆发总罢工
    示威群众同英国侵略军发生武装冲突
    新华社大马士革22日电　据伊拉克共和国电台在21日晚上广播，约旦首都安曼在21日发生了总罢工。
    约旦国王侯赛因由于不信任约旦的军队，已经请求英国干涉军镇压约旦各地人民的示威行动。在一些地方，英国军队和示威群众发生了武装冲突。
    据21日从安曼到达塞浦路斯的旅客说，20日晚上在两名约旦大臣的住宅门口发生了爆炸事件，这两名大臣是赞成英国军队侵驻约旦的。
    为了镇压日益强烈地反对英国侵略行动和侯赛因傀儡王朝的约旦人民，侯赛因已经下令把坦克和装甲车开到进入安曼的通道和通往安曼的公路的十字路口。在安曼市内和安曼附近的交通中心都有英国侵略军在巡逻。
    侯赛因还慌忙颁布了一项法令，规定对任何被认为参加企图杀害国王或者推翻政府的“阴谋”的人处以死刑。在这以前，这样的人被判处十五年以下的徒刑。
    新华社大马士革23日电　大马士革“群众报”今天刊载来自安曼的消息说，约旦国王侯赛因正在同伊朗、土耳其、英国和美国进行商谈，企图把约旦纳入已经分崩离析的巴格达条约集团。
    侯赛因企图这样来巩固他的摇摇欲坠的王朝，并且充当美英在中东扩大侵略行动的走卒。
    同时，据以色列电台今天早晨广播，英国驻中东地面部队总司令鲍尔22日曾经在安曼同侯赛因和英国驻约旦大使举行了会谈。鲍尔是在当天从塞浦路斯到安曼去的。此外有消息说，英国中东空军司令派奇也曾经匆忙地到约旦去过。
    新华社23日讯　安曼消息：在约旦人民的怒火面前，英国侵略军士兵胆战心惊。当侯赛因傀儡王朝的官员报告说有人要杀死一个英国伞兵的时候，他们从昨天晚上起更加紧张地加强警戒，连傍晚进安曼散步时也要每四个人编一组，并且携带武器。据大马士革“今天报”22日报道，约旦当局在21日晚封锁了约旦—叙利亚边境。约旦当局禁止载运小麦的一百五十辆卡车进入约旦。
    大批英国军队的侵驻，使约旦的石油荒更加严重。现在约旦每天消耗石油一千吨，但是侵黎美军使了好大劲空运石油进约旦去，一天只能运进五百吨。民用石油的数量被大大削减。因此，大部分使用汽车的交通运输已经停顿，人们在警察的监视下排队买石油。
