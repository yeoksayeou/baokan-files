The Islamic New Year is Tomorrow
Tian Lang

Tomorrow (July 18th) is the New Year of the Islamic calendar 1378.

The calculation method of the Islamic calendar is entirely based on the waxing and waning of the moon. The time for one cycle of the moon's waxing and waning is twenty-nine days, twelve hours, and forty-four minutes plus a little more. The Islamic calendar uses twenty-nine or thirty days as a month, and twelve months make a year. The number of days in each month of the Islamic calendar is fixed, with odd-numbered months being long months and even-numbered months being short months.

In this way, the Islamic year has only three hundred and fifty-four days, which is eight hours and forty-eight minutes less than the actual time for twelve lunar cycles. In less than three years, it will be one day short of the actual number of years. Therefore, the Islamic calendar has a leap year every two or three years. A leap year has three hundred and fifty-five days, with the extra day added to the twelfth month. Islamic leap years are also fixed; there are eleven leap years in thirty years. The second, fifth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twenty-first, twenty-fourth, twenty-sixth, and twenty-ninth years are all leap years.

The Islamic calendar only considers the waxing and waning of the moon, and does not add leap months based on the sun's position in the sky like the old Chinese calendar. Because of this, an Islamic year is eleven or twelve days shorter than a solar year. If the Islamic New Year and the solar New Year fall on the same day in a certain year, then in the following year, the Islamic New Year will be eleven or twelve days earlier than the solar New Year.

    回历元旦在明天
    天浪
    明天（7月18日）是回历1378年的元旦。
    回历的计算方法，完全以月亮的圆缺作为依据。月亮圆缺一次的时间是二十九天十二小时四十四分多一点。回历就以二十九天或三十天为一个月，积满十二个月就是一年。回历一年中的大小月都是固定的，单月都是大月，双月都是小月。
    这样，回历的一年只有三百五十四天，比月亮圆缺十二次的真正时间还短少八小时四十八分多。不到三年，就要比实际年数差一天，因此，回历每隔二、三年就有一个闰年。闰年是三百五十五天，这多出来的一天就在十二月里多加一天。回历闰年也有一定，在三十年间，有十一个闰年。第二、五、七、十、十三、十六、十八、二十一、二十四、二十六和二十九年都是闰年。
    回历只考虑月亮的圆缺，而像旧历一样还要根据太阳在星空中的位置来加置闰月。正因为这样，一个回历年就比阳历年要少十一、二天。如果某年回历和阳历的元旦都在同一天，到了下一年，回历元旦就要比阳历元旦早十一、二天。
