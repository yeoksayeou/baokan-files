    Confession by Default
    Zhu Zhu
    The American "Washington Post" published an editorial on July 22nd titled "Atomic Mad," criticizing an American spokesman in Beirut for publicizing that the American troops in Lebanon possessed nuclear weapons. The reason is that it is not a problem that almost any military force sent out now possesses atomic capabilities, or can possess atomic capabilities if necessary. This passage makes it very clear that the American invading troops in Lebanon do indeed possess atomic capabilities, but there is no need to publicize it.
    Why is there no need to publicize it? The editorial stated that because this is far from a large-scale campaign, but rather an action to support the Lebanese government, it only needs light weapons. With this said, the problem is even clearer. Since the American army in Lebanon only needs light weapons, but has brought nuclear weapons, doesn't this indicate that American imperialism has ulterior motives for aggression?
      The person writing the editorial for the "Washington Post" originally wanted to tell the American invading army to be careful and not reveal the truth; but he confessed by default and further exposed the ugly and ferocious face of American imperialism.

    不打自招
    朱珠
    美国“华盛顿邮报”7月22日发表了一篇题为“原子狂”的社论，指责在贝鲁特的一个美国发言人，不应该宣扬在黎巴嫩的美军拥有核武器。原因是，差不多现在派出去的任何军事部队都拥有原子能力，或者说在必要的情况下都能够拥有原子能力，这是不成问题的。这一段话说得很明白，美国侵黎部队的确拥有原子能力，只是不必宣扬罢了。
    为什么不必宣扬呢？这篇社论说，因为这远不是一次大规模的战役，而是一种支持黎巴嫩政府的行动，它只需要轻型武器就够了。这么一说，问题就摆得更明白了。既然美国军队在黎巴嫩只需要轻武器，却又带了核武器，这难道不是表明了美帝国主义有着不可告人的侵略野心吗？
      “华盛顿邮报”这个写社论的人，原想告诉美国侵略军留点神，不要露了馅；他自己却不打自招，更加暴露了美帝国主义丑恶的狰狞面目。
