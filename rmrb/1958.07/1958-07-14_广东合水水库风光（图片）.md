    Guangdong Heshui Reservoir Scenery
    Heshui Reservoir has beautiful scenery, free from floods and droughts. Ten miles of green mountains and streams flow, irrigating 100,000 mu of farmland. Fish and shrimp are fat in the water, ensuring a bumper harvest for thousands of communes and households. Flowers and fruits fill the mountains; rural scenery surpasses paradise.
    This is a folk song from Xingning County, Guangdong. The right picture shows a panoramic view of Heshui Reservoir. Farm workers are gradually building the surrounding slopes into beautiful orchards and scenic areas.

    广东合水水库风光
    合水水库好风光、洪患旱灾两不愁，十里青山溪水流、灌溉田园十万亩，鱼虾肥大水中游、千社万户保丰收，鲜花佳果满山头、农村美景胜天堂。
    这是广东兴宁县的一首民歌。右图为合水水库全景。农场工人正在逐步将水库周围的坡地建成美丽的果木园和风景区。
