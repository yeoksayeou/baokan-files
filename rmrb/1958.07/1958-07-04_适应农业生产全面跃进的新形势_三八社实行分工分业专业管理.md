Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Reporter Mao Fojun reports: The Sanba Agricultural Cooperative in Su County, Anhui Province, in order to adapt to the new situation of a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, has adopted the method of "division of labor and specialized management" to organize production. Due to the division of labor based on the strengths of the members, the comprehensive allocation and organization of labor, and the full exploitation of the productive potential of the members, various production tasks have been completed very well.

Since the great leap forward in agricultural production last winter, the enthusiasm of the members of the Sanba Cooperative has been unprecedentedly high. This year, the cooperative aims to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. To accomplish this arduous task, the Sanba Cooperative has made a series of reforms in the cultivation system and methods. The original simple division of labor in the agricultural cooperative could no longer meet the requirements of the new situation. Therefore, on the basis of the original production teams, the Sanba Cooperative simultaneously reallocated labor and organized many specialized production teams according to the nature of production and the expertise of the members, with division of labor and specialized management. At present, the cooperative has established ten specialized teams, including a rice conversion team, a dry land team, a horticulture team, a well-digging team, a greening team, a sanitation and fertilizer accumulation team, and a capital construction team. The Sanba Cooperative has also built seven small factories that directly and indirectly serve production, including an iron and wood agricultural tool repair and fitting factory, a granular fertilizer factory, an indigenous fertilizer factory, a flour mill, a feed processing factory, a brick and tile kiln, and a sewing factory. Some of the specialized teams are permanently fixed, while others are relatively fixed. This division of labor and specialization, with clear division of labor, fixed personnel, and clear responsibilities, has been warmly welcomed by the members and cadres of the cooperative.

After organizing various specialized teams, it is easier to delve into various production operations and master and improve production technology more quickly. For example, this year a specialized rice conversion team was established. In just two months, more than 500 members who originally knew nothing about rice cultivation have learned the technology of rice cultivation. A new situation of comprehensive leap forward has emerged in all production work of the cooperative. In terms of water conservancy, the cooperative has completed a total of one million cubic meters of earthwork. In terms of agricultural production, it recently completed the summer harvest task of more than 10,000 mu of wheat in just four days and four nights, ten days ahead of schedule compared to previous years. In terms of greening, the cooperative has planted more than 15 million trees, with a survival rate of over 90%. In terms of manufacturing and improving agricultural tools, the cooperative has reformed more than 200 larger agricultural tools, greatly improving labor efficiency.

At present, the summer planting work of the Sanba Cooperative is proceeding intensively. Although there are numerous production tasks, time is tight, and the tasks are heavy, the members are fighting day and night against the drought, but the production order is well organized, and no confusion has occurred.

    适应农业生产全面跃进的新形势
    三八社实行分工分业专业管理
    据新华社讯　记者冒茀君报道：安徽省宿县三八农业社为了适应农业生产全面大跃进的新形势，采用“分工分业，专业管理”的办法组织生产。由于按照社员的专长实行分工分业，全面调配和组织劳动力，充分发挥了社员的生产潜力，各项生产任务都完成得很好。
    三八社自从去年冬天农业生产大跃进以来，社员生产积极性空前高涨。今年这个社要求达到亩产一千斤的指标。为了完成这个艰巨的任务，三八社在耕作制度和耕作方法上都作了一系列的改革。原来农业社简单的劳动分工已不能适应新形势的要求。因此，三八社在原有生产队的基础上，同时重新调配劳动力，按生产性质，按社员专长组织许多生产专业队，分工分业，专业管理。现在全社已经成立了改种水稻队、旱田队、园业队、打井队、绿化队、卫生积肥队、基本建设队等十个专业队。三八社还建成了直接和间接为生产服务的铁木业农具修配厂、颗粒肥料厂、土化肥厂、面粉厂、饲料加工厂、砖瓦窑厂、缝纫厂等七个小工厂。专业队有些是常年固定，有些是相对固定。这种分工分业，由于分工清楚，人员固定，责任明确，受到社员和社干部的热烈欢迎。
    组织各种专业队以后，便于深入钻研各项生产业务，更快地掌握和提高生产技术。如今年专门成立了改种水稻专业队，只有短短两个月的时间，原来对种水稻一窍不通的社员已有五百多人学会了种水稻的技术。全社各项生产工作出现了全面大跃进的新局面。在水利方面，全社共完成土方一百万公方。在农业生产方面，最近四天四夜就突击割完一万多亩小麦，比往年提前十天完成了夏收任务。在绿化方面，全社植树一千五百多万棵，成活率达90％以上。在制造和改良农具方面，全社已改革较大的农具二百多件，大大提高了劳动效率。
    目前，三八社的夏种工作正在紧张进行。虽然各种生产工作千头万绪，时间紧迫，任务繁重，社员们正与干旱日夜苦战，但是生产秩序井井有条，没有发生混乱现象。
