    Overcoming the Bad Habit of Not Producing on Memorial Days
    Hainan Youth Change Customs and Habits

    (Our report) Many young people in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have become promoters of changing customs and habits.

    The vast majority of the autonomous prefecture's more than 120,000 young people of all ethnic groups have changed the bad habit of not participating in agricultural activities on memorial days and festivals. During this year's spring planting and spring plowing, the attendance rate of young people in various places reached more than 95%. The Songhe Reservoir, which was once brought to a standstill in February this year because some people wanted to rest for about a month during the Spring Festival according to past habits, was led by a shock brigade organized by more than 100 members of the Communist Youth League and other young people. They put forward the slogan of not going home until the project was completed, so that the entire project could proceed as usual. Many young people in various places also took the lead in carrying out agricultural activities on so-called memorial days such as Cow Day, Insect Day, Goose Day, and Thunder Day, educating the masses with facts and changing the masses' habit of not daring to cultivate on these memorial days. Young people in Baoting, Ledong and other counties also broke the custom that the masses did not dare to enter the cemetery mountains.

    The "Fang Liao" custom (remnants of primitive group marriage), which seriously affected health and venereal diseases in the past, has now been replaced by new ways of falling in love. Many areas of the autonomous prefecture often carry out regular recreational activities, so that young men and women have correct ways to socialize. Many young people in many regions have pledged that they will resolutely not participate in "Fang Liao" activities. Not long ago, more than 200 young people in Baoyou Town, Ledong County, demolished all 500 or more thatched houses that were used for "Fang Liao" in the past, and rebuilt them into hundreds of cowsheds, pigsties, chicken coops, and toilets. Most of the young women in the autonomous prefecture have also changed the bad customs inherited from history, such as asking for betrothal gifts for marriage and not doing certain farm work.

    破除忌日不生产的陋习
    海南青年移风易俗
    本报讯　海南黎族苗族自治州许多青年，在移风易俗中成为促进派。
    全州十二万多各族青年，大部分都改变了逢忌日、节日不参加农事活动的陋习。今年春种春耕中，各地青年出勤率达到95％以上。今年2月间曾因某些群众要以过去习惯，在春节休息一个月左右而陷于停工的颂和水库，在一百多共青团员和青年所组织的突击队带动下，提出不完工不回家的口号，使整个工程得以照常进行。各地不少青年还自己带头在所谓忌日的牛日、虫日、鹅日、雷日进行农事活动，以事实教育了群众，改变了群众不敢在这些忌日耕作的习惯。保亭、乐东等县的青年还破除群众不敢进墓山的习俗。
    过去严重地影响健康和传染性病的“放寮”（原始群婚制的残余）风气，现在也为新的恋爱方式所代替。自治州不少地区都经常地展开了正当的文娱活动，使青年男女社交有正确的途径。许多地区的青年都提出自己坚决不去参加“放寮”活动的保证。乐东县抱由镇的两百多青年，不久以前还把过去“放寮”的五百多所草房全部拆除，改建成几百间牛栏、猪舍、鸡房和厕所等。自治州大部分的青年妇女也改变了历史上遗留下的结婚要采礼、不做某些农活等不好的习俗。
