Miracles Created Under the Leadership of the Party
Ai Bei

The correct leadership of the Party is the guarantee of victory in all socialist construction undertakings. This is an irrefutable truth.

In the struggle to save Qiu Cai康, a Communist Party member and worker at the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 who was severely burned by molten iron, the miracle created by the doctors and nurses of Shanghai Guangci Hospital with strong support from all sides once again proves that the combination of the Party's leadership and the creative labor of the masses is invincible.

The victory in the struggle to save Qiu Cai康 was first and foremost a victory for the Party's ideological and political work. Initially, many doctors in the hospital were deeply influenced by foreign literature and believed that Qiu Cai康's life could not be saved. However, the Party organization used the Marxist method of class analysis to analyze the different views of objective things under different systems, negated certain statistical data of the bourgeoisie, and thus helped everyone to break free from the horns of a dilemma, break superstitions, and inspire creative enthusiasm, achieving success in medical work.

The struggle to save Qiu Cai康 also demonstrated the victory of the rectification movement led by the Party. The rectification movement greatly promoted the relationship of collaboration between departments and between people, heavily struck at individualistic ideas of fame and gain, so that the medical work of Guangci Hospital could obtain broad support from all aspects of society, so that medical workers could serve patients wholeheartedly, and began to break free from the state of working alone, embarked on the road of strengthening collaboration, and launched a campaign of doing everything possible and a campaign of offering suggestions, finally creating an unprecedented miracle with the collective strength of collaboration.

Of course, Comrade Qiu Cai康's high communist qualities and his vigorous vitality were also important factors in this medical victory. He not only inspired and encouraged all medical personnel, but also helped the smooth progress of medical work with the unique perseverance of a communist.

The victory in the struggle to save worker Qiu Cai康 once again proves that the victory of any work is inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Because only a Marxist party can comprehensively analyze objective things, mobilize the strength of the masses, formulate and implement correct lines, and do things that predecessors have not done.

    在党领导下创造的奇迹
    艾北
    党的正确领导是一切社会主义建设事业胜利的保证。这是颠扑不破的真理。
    在抢救上海钢铁厂第三厂被铁水严重灼伤的工人、共产党员丘财康的生命的斗争中，上海广慈医院的医生和护理人员在各方面大力支持下创造的奇迹，再一次证明了党的领导和群众创造性劳动的结合，是无往不胜的。
    抢救丘财康的斗争的胜利，首先是党的思想工作和政治工作的胜利。起初，院内许多医师受外国文献影响很深，认为丘财康的生命无法挽救。但是，党组织用马克思主义的阶级分析方法，分析了在不同制度下，人们对客观事物的不同看法，否定了资产阶级的某些统计资料，这才帮助大家从牛角尖中解放出来，打破了迷信，鼓起了创造性的干劲，取得了医疗工作的成就。
    在抢救丘财康的斗争中，又表现了党所领导的整风运动的胜利。整风运动大大促进了部门之间、人同人之间的协作关系，重重地打击了个人主义的名利观点，从而使广慈医院的医疗工作能获得社会各方面的广泛支持，使医务工作者能全心全意为病人服务，并开始从单干的状态中解放出来，走上加强协作的道路，掀起千方百计运动、献计献策运动，终于在集体的协作的力量下，创造了史无前例的奇迹。
    当然，丘财康同志高度的共产主义的品质，和他的旺盛的生命力，也是这次医疗胜利的重要因素。他不仅激励和鼓舞了所有的医务人员，并且以一个共产主义者特有的毅力，帮助了医疗工作的顺利进行。
    抢救工人丘财康的斗争的胜利，再一次证明了任何工作的胜利，都离不开党的领导。因为只有马克思主义的政党才能全面分析客观事物，动员群众力量，规定并执行正确的路线，做出前人没有做过的事。
