    Inner Mongolia Pastoral Areas Achieve Double Harvest in Cooperative Production
    Herdsmen Actively Establish Cooperatives, Basically Achieving Cooperation Throughout the Region Within Six Months
    Overcoming Heavy Snow and Severe Drought, the Net Increase of Various Livestock Reaches 2.7 Million Head
    (Report from our newspaper) Our reporter comments on the double harvest of pastoral cooperation and animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved two major harvests in pastoral cooperation and animal husbandry production. The number of herdsmen households participating in cooperatives and joint public-private livestock farms has increased from 27% at the end of last year to 84.6%, basically achieving pastoral cooperation throughout the region. In animal husbandry production, after overcoming severe snowstorms and droughts, the total number of livestock in the region has increased from 22.39 million head last year to 25.09 million head, a net increase of 2.7 million head, a net increase rate of 12.06%, exceeding this year's production increase plan by 4.6%.
    This high tide of animal husbandry cooperation and production is the result of the region's Party organization leading the masses in carrying out the mass rectification movement since last summer and autumn. During the rectification, through the great debate on the two roads, the determination of the herdsmen to take the socialist road was greatly strengthened, and the consciousness of cadres in leading the herdsmen to take the socialist road was enhanced. At the same time, countless facts prove that pastoral cooperatives have enormous advantages. According to a survey of 26 cooperatives, 12 cooperatives achieved a net reproduction rate of 20%-28%, and 4 cooperatives reached 30%-41%, one of which even reached 43%. The great leap forward in production of pastoral cooperatives, in turn, promoted the development of cooperation. The fact that the Yikezhao League vigorously developed water conservancy and opened up feed bases in pastoral areas made the broad masses of herdsmen deeply feel that the individual economy and mutual aid groups could not achieve a great leap forward in production, and they actively organized themselves. The rapid emergence of cooperation and production upsurges on the Inner Mongolia grasslands also depends on adequate preparation. Last winter and this spring, the region trained more than 3,000 backbones of cooperatives and mutual aid groups, dispatched more than 1,000 cadres to be stationed in the cooperatives, and organized more than 600 work teams to establish cooperatives. Most importantly, the Party Central Committee's general line encouraged the will of the people. The herdsmen are all exerting their efforts and striving for the top, struggling to build a new socialist pastoral area in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    Last year, many parts of the autonomous region suffered severe natural disasters, but the region's animal husbandry production still achieved a bumper harvest. In addition to the advantages of the cooperatives, one of the reasons is that in recent years, the autonomous region has educated cadres and the masses to correct the policy of developing animal husbandry, and severely criticized the erroneous ideas of valuing agriculture over animal husbandry and the "theory that disasters cannot be overcome." People have been liberated from conservative and backward old ideas, and their enthusiasm for developing animal husbandry has been greatly enhanced. Secondly, the examples of high-speed development of animal husbandry among the people have also educated cadres and the masses. The breeding survival rate of livestock of many labor models reached 70% for horses, 80% for cattle, and 90% for sheep. Many labor models have proposed this year to achieve 80% for horses, 90% for cattle, and 100% for sheep. In Urad Front Banner, herds of sheep that all gave birth to twins were also discovered. The survival rate of young livestock in many cooperatives reached 90% to 100%. These examples encouraged cadres and the masses to tap the potential of production with greater enthusiasm. Thirdly, the people have demonstrated great enthusiasm in the struggle against disasters. For example, the drought that occurred this year in the Ordos grassland and the Tengger Desert grassland was unprecedented in thirty years, but because the masses were mobilized to carry out arduous tasks such as moving pasture, livestock not only did not decrease but increased by 8%. The basic construction of animal husbandry has also been continuously developed in recent years. Efforts have been strengthened in drilling wells, storing grass, preparing feed equipment, and building winter and spring camps.
    In short, the general situation in the pastoral areas is that the rectification movement has raised the socialist consciousness of the masses, promoted the consolidation and development of cooperatives, and promoted a great leap forward in production; and the consolidation and development of cooperatives has also promoted the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the masses and the great leap forward in production. These factors combined constitute the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts.
    At present, under the conditions of double harvest in cooperation and production in animal husbandry in Inner Mongolia, it can be predicted that the face of the pastoral areas will be rapidly changed.

### 内蒙古牧区合作生产双丰收  牧民积极办社半年内全区基本实现合作化  战胜大雪大旱各种牲畜纯增二百七十万头

    内蒙古牧区合作生产双丰收
    牧民积极办社半年内全区基本实现合作化
    战胜大雪大旱各种牲畜纯增二百七十万头
    本报讯　记者评述内蒙古自治区牧业合作化和畜牧业生产的双丰收。内蒙古自治区在牧业合作化和畜牧业生产方面取得了两大丰收。参加合作社和公私合营牧场的牧户已由去年底的27％增加到84.6％，全区基本上实现了牧业合作化；畜牧业生产，也在战胜严重的风雪灾害和旱灾后，全区牲畜已由去年的二千二百三十九万头增长到二千五百零九万头，纯增二百七十万头，纯增率为12.06％，超额4.6％完成了今年的增产计划。
    这个畜牧业合作化高潮和生产高潮是去年夏秋以来自治区党组织领导群众进行了全民整风运动的结果。在整风中，经过两条道路的大辩论，大大坚定了牧民群众走社会主义道路的决心，提高了干部领导牧民群众走社会主义道路的自觉性。同时，无数的事实证明：牧业合作社有着巨大的优越性。据二十六个社调查，有十二个社纯增殖率达到20％—28％，有四个社达到30％—41％，其中一个社曾达到43％。而牧业社生产的大跃进，又促进了合作化的发展。伊克昭盟在牧区大力兴办水利和开辟饲料基地的事实，使广大牧民群众深深感觉到个体经济和互助组无法实现生产上的大跃进，而纷纷组织起来。内蒙古草原上所以如此迅速地出现了合作化和生产高潮，还有赖于充分的准备工作。去冬今春，全区训练了三千多合作社、互助组的骨干，调派了一千多个驻社干部，组织了六百多个办社工作组。最重要的是党中央的总路线鼓舞了人民群众的意志，牧民群众都在鼓足干劲，力争上游，为多快好省的建设社会主义新牧区而斗争。
    去年，自治区许多地方遭到了严重的自然灾害，但是，全区畜牧业生产依然取得了丰收。除了合作社的优越性外，原因之一是近几年来自治区教育干部和群众端正了发展畜牧业的政策，严正批判了重农轻牧思想以及“灾害不可战胜论”等错误思想，人们从保守落后的旧思想上解放出来，发展畜牧业的积极性就大为提高。其次，人民群众中高速度发展畜牧业的范例也教育了干部群众。许多劳动模范牲畜的繁殖成活率，马达到70％，牛达到80％，羊达90％。许多劳模今年提出要作到马80％，牛90％，羊100％。在乌拉特前旗，还发现了全部产双羔的畜群。许多合作社幼畜成活达到90％到100％，这些范例鼓舞了干部和群众以更大的积极性去发掘生产的潜在力量。再次，是在与灾害作斗争中人民群众发挥了巨大的积极性。例如鄂尔多斯草原和腾格里沙漠草原今年出现的旱灾是三十年所未有的，但是，因为发动群众进行了移场等艰巨工作，牲畜不但没有下降，反而增加了8％。近年畜牧业的基本建设也有不断发展。打井、贮草、备料设备，建设冬春营地等工作都加强了。
    总之，牧区总的形势是：整风运动提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，促进了合作社的巩固和发展，促进了生产大跃进；而合作社的巩固和发展，也促进了群众的社会主义觉悟的提高和生产的大跃进。这些因素结合起来，就构成了社会主义革命在经济、政治、思想战线上的胜利。
    目前内蒙古的畜牧业在合作、生产两丰收的条件下，可以预料，牧区面貌将迅速为之改观。
