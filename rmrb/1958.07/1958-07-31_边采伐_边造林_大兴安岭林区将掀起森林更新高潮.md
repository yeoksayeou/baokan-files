Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, July 30th. The Party committee and administrative leadership of the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range Forestry Administration held a forest renewal leap forward conference at the Yituli River Forestry Bureau from July 20th to 25th, reversing the situation where renewal could not keep up with logging. The conference resolved that in the future, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously promoting logging and renewal, and planting more trees than are felled, mobilizing the vast number of workers and their families in the forest area to quickly launch a high tide of forest renewal.

At this forest renewal leap forward conference, the principal party and government leaders of each forestry bureau, in accordance with the instructions of Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region, to "log with one hand and plant trees with the other" and "cut trees with the left hand and plant trees with the right hand," reviewed and criticized the previous period's emphasis on logging while neglecting forest renewal, believing that logging must be fast and renewal can be slow, an erroneous implementation of the forestry production policy; cadres responsible for forest management criticized right-leaning conservative thinking in renewal work; at the same time, the passive and balanced idea of letting logging wait for renewal was criticized. The conference proposed that overall planning should be taken into account, so that logging and renewal can achieve a double leap forward. In this regard, the Yituli River Bureau set an example, implementing a continuous operation method of logging and renewal. Due to insufficient manpower, they changed the single-operation labor organization to a mixed collaborative labor organization, improved labor productivity, drew a portion of people to invest in renewal, and mobilized a large number of family members to participate in renewal. In terms of renewal tools, they adopted some machinery to replace manual land preparation. After the attendees visited the Yituli River Bureau's practices on the spot, they all expressed that they would learn from the bureau's various advanced experiences and catch up with or surpass them.

The meeting also exchanged experiences on using wild seedling transplantation methods to carry out artificial afforestation in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and exchanged effective methods of artificial promotion of natural renewal such as burning branches and buds; and decided to launch a mass movement to innovate tools, so that renewal work would gradually transition to mechanized and semi-mechanized operations, to accelerate the progress of renewal.

    边采伐　边造林
    大兴安岭林区将掀起森林更新高潮
    据新华社牙克石30日电　内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局党委和行政领导机关，7月20日至25日在伊图里河林业局召开森林更新跃进大会，扭转更新跟不上采伐的形势。大会决议：今后要认真贯彻执行采伐与更新同时并举和造多于砍的方针，发动林区广大职工和家属迅速掀起森林更新高潮。
    在这次森林更新跃进大会上，各林业局党政负责人根据自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫要求作到“一手采伐，一手造林”，“左手砍树，右手栽树”的指示精神，检查和批判了前一段时期重视采伐而忽视森林更新，认为采伐必须多快、更新可以少慢的片面地执行林业生产方针的错误；负责森林经管的干部，批判了更新工作中的右倾保守思想；同时批判了让采伐等一等更新的消极平衡的想法。大会提出要统筹兼顾，使采伐和更新做到双跃进。在这方面伊图里河局作出了榜样，这个局实行了采伐与更新连续作业法。人手不足，他们改变单项作业劳动组织为混合协作的劳动组织，提高了劳动生产率，抽出一部分人投入更新，并动员大批家属参加更新。在更新工具方面，他们采用了一部分机具代替手工整地。到会人员实地参观了伊图里河局的作法以后，都表示要学习这个局的各项先进经验，并赶上或超过他们。
    会上还交流了采取野生苗移植方法，多快好省地进行人工造林的经验，交流了火烧枝芽等人工促进天然更新的有效办法；并且决定掀起群众性的革新工具的运动，使更新工作逐步转为机械化和半机械化作业，以加快更新进度。
