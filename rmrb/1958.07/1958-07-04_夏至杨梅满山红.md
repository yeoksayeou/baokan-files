    Summer Solstice, Yangmei Fill the Mountains Red
    Xu Shijin
    "In the fifth month, yangmei fill the forest,
    At first, each fruit seems worth a thousand gold,
    Its taste as rich as grapes from Hebei,
    Its color deeper than lychees from Hunan."

    This is an ancient poem praising the yangmei. The yangmei is a perennial evergreen fruit tree. It has a beautiful shape, growing to about two zhang (approximately 6.7 meters) in height. Its leaves are long and ovate, clustered at the tips of the branches. The flowers are small and unisexual, blooming in the spring. “Summer Solstice, yangmei fill the mountains red,” the fruits ripen around the time of the Summer Solstice. Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" says, "Its shape resembles the water plum, and its taste is like the plum, hence the name." The fruit color comes in three types: purple, red, and white. The purple type is the best, the white type is also good, and the red type is the lowest in quality. The taste of yangmei is generally judged by the appearance of the flesh. It is usually sweet and slightly sour, very palatable. It contains a lot of Vitamin C, which can help digestion and increase nutrition, and it also has the effect of treating neuritis and preventing scurvy. In addition to being eaten fresh, it can also be made into liquor, dried yangmei, preserved yangmei, and candied yangmei, etc. The bark of this fruit tree can also be used as a brown dye, and the wood can be used for fine work or firewood.

    Yangmei is native to southern China, and is cultivated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces. It is not widely distributed in other countries around the world, and is mostly wild. Only China cultivates it most extensively as a fruit tree. In 1956, the Central Ministry of Agriculture collected a batch of yangmei seedlings from Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and transported them to the Soviet Union for planting. The yangmei produced in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, as well as Tangqi in Hangzhou, Dongting in Suzhou, and Chashan in Wenzhou, are famous far and wide. China has been planting yangmei for more than a thousand years. Experience has shown that this fruit tree not only produces excellent fruits, but also has root nodules on its roots, which, like leguminous green manure, can increase soil fertility (therefore, in forestry, it is specially called "fertilizer wood"). Now, many new yangmei mountains have been opened up in China, with trees stretching as far as the eye can see, which also helps to reduce soil erosion and protect mountainous areas!

    Yangmei prefers warm, humid conditions and deep, sandy soil, so people often plant it on sloping mountain valleys. It has a long lifespan, living for one or two hundred years is not uncommon. Each productive tree can yield two to three hundred catties (approximately 100-150 kg) of fruit. However, yangmei has years of high yield and years of low yield, because the branches do not grow well in the year of high yield, and the yield will be low in the second year, while low yield is conducive to branch growth, and the yield will be high again in the third year, and low again in the fourth year, and so on, alternating between high and low. However, we can limit the number of results in the year of high yield by increasing fertilizer application and pruning the fruit, so as to eliminate this phenomenon of alternating high and low yields. This year is a year of abundant yangmei harvest. It is estimated that Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, will produce 1.2 million catties this year, which will set a record high in history. The yangmei in Chashan, Wenzhou, is also full of trees this year, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

    The Second Five-Year Plan calls for a large-scale development of fruit trees, and for "fruit trees to go up the mountains," facing the mountainous areas. Yangmei originally grows in mountainous areas. Large-scale planting will not only not compete with grain for land, but also green the mountainous areas and conserve water and soil. In the near future, there will be more beautiful and prosperous yangmei coming from all over southern China!

    夏至杨梅满山红
    许世津
    五月杨梅已满林，初疑一颗值千金，味方河朔葡萄重，色比泸南荔子深。
    这是古人赞美杨梅的诗。杨梅是一种多年生常绿果树。树形优美，高二丈左右。叶子长卵形，聚生在枝的顶端。花小单性，春季开花。“夏至杨梅满山红”，果实在夏至时候成熟，李时珍本草纲目上说“其形像水杨子，而味似梅，故名”。果色有紫、红、白三类，紫种最好，白种也不错，红种品质最次。杨梅滋味好坏，普通都从果肉外表上察看。一般都是甜而略酸，很可口。它含有丙种维生素很多，能助消化增营养，还有治神经炎和预防坏血病的功效。它除了可以鲜食外，还可以制成烧酒、杨梅干、杨梅脯、糖渍杨梅等。这种果树的皮还可以用作褐色染料，木材可以用作细工或薪炭。
    杨梅原产我国南部，浙江、江苏、江西、广东等省都有栽培。世界各国分布不多，多系野生。作为果树栽培，只有我国最盛。1956年中央农业部从绍兴萧山采集了一批杨梅秧苗，运往苏联栽种。绍兴萧山，以及杭州塘栖、苏州洞庭、温州茶山等地所产的杨梅，是远近闻名的。我国栽种杨梅已有千年以上的历史。经验证明，这种果树不但结出优良果实，同时根部生有根瘤，和豆科绿肥一样，能增加土壤肥力（所以森林学上特称它为“肥料木”）。现在国内新开辟许多杨梅山，漫山遍野，一望成林，还有减少水土流失、保护山区的作用哩！
    杨梅性喜温暖湿润和土质深厚的砂质土壤，所以人们常常把它种在倾斜山岙阴谷间。它的寿命很长，活上一、二百年不算多。丰产的每株可摘果二、三百斤。不过杨梅有大年小年之分，因为结果多的一年枝条生长不好，第二年结果就少，而结果少又有利于枝条生长，到第三年结果又多，第四年又少，就这样一年多一年少。但是，我们可以在结果多的那年用增施肥料和修剪疏果的方法，限制结果数量，来消灭这种大小年现象。今年是杨梅丰收年，浙江萧山，今年估计可产一百二十万斤，将创历史上最高记录。温州茶山杨梅，今年也满树累累，丰收在望。
    第二个五年计划，要大量发展果树，要“果树上山”，面向山区。杨梅本来生长山区，大量栽种，不但不会与粮食争地，并可以绿化山区，保持水土。在不久的将来，祖国南方各地，定会出现更多美丽富饶的杨梅来！
