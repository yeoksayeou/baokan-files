Xinhua News Agency, London, July 28th: Reactions from many British Sunday newspapers indicate widespread support among various levels of British society for the proposal to hold a summit meeting.

    Editorials in "Reynolds News," "News of the World," and "Sunday Pictorial" all call for the removal of all obstacles in the path of holding a summit meeting. The "News of the World" editorial said: "We do not believe that world leaders who listen to the voices of the people would refuse this opportunity for East-West talks. The people of all countries expect this meeting."
    The "Reynolds News" editorial said that there should be no reservations about holding a summit meeting. Western countries should agree to resolve the Middle East issue and "should give the Arab people the freedom to decide their own political future."
    The newspaper called on British Prime Minister Macmillan to "forcefully tell him [Dulles] that British public opinion cannot allow delays" when Dulles comes to London to attend the so-called "Baghdad Pact" meeting.
    Labor Party activist Dribble, in a commentary on the current international situation in "Reynolds News," emphasized the extreme importance of holding a high-level meeting and believed that the Soviet Union's attitude and proposals proved that "the Soviet government takes this crisis very seriously."
    Prior to this, the "Daily Express" published an editorial on the 26th that also criticized the United States for "unjustifiably" "delaying" the summit meeting, which was like "a cold wind blowing."
    The "Daily Mirror," in an open letter to US Secretary of State Dulles published in bold type on the front and second pages, said that the entire British people, most newspapers, and probably all politicians believe that top-level talks are crucial. They believe that "due to the serious potential danger of the Middle East crisis, it is an urgent issue that should be discussed by the leaders of all countries gathering together."
    They believe: "The United States is trying to delay, delay, and delay again—perhaps even sabotage—the holding of this meeting."
    The "News Chronicle" published an article by Camaren on the 23rd entitled "Why Don't We Consider Holding a Top-Level Meeting Quickly?" which called on the British government to take a more active attitude toward holding a summit meeting.
    The article pointed out that some senior British figures dismissed Khrushchev's letter agreeing to hold a summit meeting within the United Nations Security Council as propaganda. However, "demanding negotiations to stop a war is good propaganda by anyone's standards."
    The author admitted that in this respect, Khrushchev had "launched a diplomatic satellite first" and "taken the lead" over the West.
    The author concluded: "Can we never take the initiative on anything in the world except to stubbornly assist figures who have already failed? There is still time to wake up from our sleep, but… time is running out."

    Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 27th, TASS: American newspapers have published many articles commenting on the prospects for holding a summit meeting to resolve the Middle East situation. These articles believe that the American ruling circles will do everything possible to use their habitual tricks of evasion and delay in order to postpone or completely sabotage the meeting.
    For several days, major American newspapers have also successively published some blatantly inflammatory articles and reports, deliberately offering various excuses that the US government may use to avoid attending the summit meeting, thereby shirking responsibility for the crimes committed by it and its accomplice Britain in the Near East.
    The claim that the meeting "will not produce results if it is not thoroughly prepared" is a common argument used by most newspapers to support the government's position on the meeting issue. Currently, American newspapers and officials are trying to downplay the "lack of preparation" in an effort to conceal America's unwillingness and fear to convene a high-level meeting.
    "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Drummond wrote on this point: "When Eisenhower sits down with Khrushchev in the Security Council, he himself and his advisors will be convinced that he is holding an untimely, ill-considered, and hopeless meeting with the Soviet Union."
    Drummond also said that, according to his existing materials, Eisenhower and Dulles' attitude toward the high-level meeting is due to the fact that "the meeting is not well prepared."
    "New York Times" reporter Smith pointed out that "the meeting to be held now may be an unprepared meeting with little chance of successful negotiations."
    Prominent American commentator Lippmann believes that under the current conditions, a high-level meeting would be a "terrible farce" for the United States. Many other newspapers have also repeated this statement from different perspectives.
    American commentators and newspapers are continuing to comment on Eisenhower's recent letter to Khrushchev from this viewpoint.
    The "New York Times" wrote: "Eisenhower's letter did not arouse any enthusiasm among British Labour Party members, who believe that the letter shows that the United States wants to delay the convening of a high-level meeting, and may even drown the issue in a sea of technical details."
    American commentator Reston also believes that Eisenhower's letter is "to buy time and play tricks."

    英国舆论广泛评论首脑会议问题
    敦促美英政府不要采取拖延态度
    美国一些报纸提出各种借口企图设置路障
    据新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国许多星期日报纸的反应表明，英国各阶层人士广泛支持召开政府首脑会议的主张。
      “雷诺新闻”、“世界新闻报”和“星期日画报”的社论都要求消除在召开政府首脑会议道路上的一切障碍。“世界新闻报”的社论说：“我们不相信，世界上倾听群众呼声的领导人会拒绝这个东西方会谈的机会。各国人民都期望这次会谈。”
      “雷诺新闻”的社论说，在召开政府首脑会议的问题上不能有任何保留。西方国家应该同意解决中东问题，“应当给阿拉伯人民以解决自己的政治前途的自由”。
    这家报纸要求英国首相麦克米伦趁杜勒斯到伦敦参加所谓“巴格达条约”会议的时候“有力地告诉他：英国舆论不能允许拖延”。
    工党著名活动家德赖伯在“雷诺新闻”上评论了当前的国际局势时强调指出，召开高级会议极其重要，并认为苏联的态度和建议证明“苏联政府非常认真地对待这个危机。”
    在这以前，“每日快报”26日发表的社论也责备美国“拖延”政府首脑会议是“毫无理由”的，美国的这种作法，有如“刮来一阵冷风”。
    “每日镜报”在用粗体字刊登在头版和二版上的一封给美国国务卿杜勒斯的公开信中说，英国全体人民、大多数报纸以及可能所有的政治家都认为，最高级会谈是十分重要的。他们认为，“由于中东危机具有严重的潜在危险，它是应当由各国领袖们聚首一堂来加以讨论的紧迫问题。”
    他们认为：“美国正在设法拖延、拖延、再拖延——或许甚至于在破坏——这次会议的召开。”
    “新闻纪事报”在23日刊载了卡马仁的一篇题为“为什么我们不考虑迅速召开一次最高级会议？”的文章，要求英国政府对召开政府首脑会议采取更为积极的态度。
    这篇文章指出，对于赫鲁晓夫关于同意在联合国安全理事会内举行政府首脑会议的信件，英国某些高级人士竟然把它说成是一种宣传。但是，“要求谈判以制止战争，按照任何人的标准来衡量，都是良好的宣传。”
    作者承认，在这方面，赫鲁晓夫已经“在外交上先放卫星”，比西方“占先”。
    作者最后说：“难道我们除了一味固执地援助已经失败的人物之外，永远不能对世界上任何事情采取主动么？现在从我们的睡梦里觉醒起来仍然有时间，可是……时间已经不多了。”
    据新华社28日讯　塔斯社纽约27日讯：美国报纸刊载了许多文章，评论为解决中东局势而召开政府首脑会议的远景。这些文章认为，美国统治集团将尽一切努力使用它的规避拖延的惯技以便拖延或者完全破坏这个会议。
    美国的大报几天来还陆续刊载了一些明显的煽动性的文章和报道，故意提出各种各样的借口，美国政府利用这些借口可能不参加政府首脑会议，从而推卸它和它的同伙英国在近东所犯的罪行的责任。
    所谓会议“如果不进行周密准备，便不会得到结果”这个说法，是大多数报纸替政府在会议问题的立场上帮腔的普遍论调。现在美国报纸和官方人士为了掩饰美国不愿意和害怕召开高级会议，竭力玩弄“没有准备”这个字眼。
      “纽约先驱论坛报”记者德拉蒙德就这一点写道：“当艾森豪威尔在安全理事会同赫鲁晓夫坐在一起的时候，他本人和他的顾问们会深信，他同苏联举行的是一次不合时宜的、考虑不周到的没有希望的会议。”
    德拉蒙德还说，根据他现有的材料，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯对待高级会议的这种态度，就是因为“会议没有很好的准备”。
    “纽约时报”记者史密斯指出，“现在要召开的会议也许是一次没有准备的会议，很少有谈判成功的可能”。
    著名美国评论员李普曼认为，在目前的条件下，对美国来说，高级会议将是“可怕的恶作剧”。其他许多报纸也都从不同的角度重复了这种说法。
    美国评论员和报纸正是从这个观点出发在继续评论艾森豪威尔最近给赫鲁晓夫的信。
    “纽约时报”写道：“艾森豪威尔的信在英国工党人士中间没有引起任何热情，他们认为这封信表明，美国想拖延高级会议的召开，甚至可能把这个问题淹没在技术细节的大海中”。
    美国评论员赖斯顿也认为艾森豪威尔的信是“为了赢得时间和耍手腕”。
