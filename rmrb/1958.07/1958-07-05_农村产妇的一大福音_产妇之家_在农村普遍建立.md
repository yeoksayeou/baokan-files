Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: A type of small-scale maternity hospital, known as "Maternity Homes" by rural women, is being widely promoted in rural areas across the country. According to statistics from some areas in Henan, Jiangxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces, more than 5,290 new rural maternity hospitals have been established during the Great Leap Forward.

The establishment of these rural maternity hospitals ensures that women can give birth safely and that their families can participate in labor without worry. Therefore, they are very popular among the masses. Pregnant women can often go to the maternity hospital for check-ups before delivery, and when the expected date is near, they can go to the maternity hospital to await labor. During childbirth, midwives in the maternity hospital are responsible for delivery and provide careful care. Some maternity hospitals also regularly check the health of rural women and treat various gynecological diseases. The maternity hospital of the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Deyang County, Sichuan Province, has delivered more than 150 babies and provided prenatal check-ups for more than 200 pregnant women in the past ten months, and both mothers and babies are healthy. In the past, female commune member Liao Hongxiu had given birth to four children at home, all of whom died due to apparent death and could not be saved. Her fifth child also experienced apparent death, but was saved by the midwife in the maternity hospital using artificial respiration. In the past, premature babies and twins, which were traditionally considered difficult to raise in rural areas, are now growing up healthily due to the meticulous care and adoption of new methods of childcare in the maternity hospital. Difficult labor problems can generally be solved as well.

These rural maternity hospitals are all established by agricultural cooperatives relying on the strength of the masses. The delivery rooms generally utilize existing houses or are built by mobilizing commune members to use waste materials. Equipment is simple and makeshift. General furniture, medicines, and equipment are mostly provided by the agricultural cooperative itself or donated or rented by the health department. Some of the midwives are sent by the health department, and some are trained by the agricultural cooperative itself. They all have certain knowledge of maternal and child health and new methods of delivery. The charges for the maternity hospital are low, and women in labor generally only need to bring their own food and bedding. Some maternity hospitals also provide various other conveniences to women in labor. For example, if a woman in labor has a child who cannot be left alone, she can bring them to the maternity hospital, where the hospital is responsible for taking care of them, reducing the woman's worries.

    农村产妇的一大福音
    “产妇之家”在农村普遍建立
    新华社4日讯　被农村妇女称为“产妇之家”的一种小型产院，正在各地农村中普遍推广。据河南、江西、甘肃、四川等省部分地区的统计，在大跃进中新成立的农村产院就有五千二百九十多处。
    这些农村产院的建立，保证了产妇能安全地分娩，产妇的家属也能安心地照常参加劳动，因而很受群众欢迎。孕妇们在产前可以经常到产院检查，产期临近的时候可以到产院待产，产时就由产院里的接生员负责接生，细心照顾。有的产院还经常给农村妇女检查身体，治疗各种妇科疾病。四川德阳县新生农业社的产院，十个月来共接生了一百五十多个婴儿，给二百多个孕妇作了产前检查，妇婴都很健康。女社员廖洪秀过去在家生过四个孩子，都因为假死没有救活。她的第五个孩子也发生了假死现象，但在产院里被接生员用人工呼吸救活了。过去农村中一向认为很难带活的早产儿和双生子，现在由于产院的周密护理和采用新法育儿，大都健康地成长着。难产问题一般也都能解决。
    这些农村产院都是由农业社依靠群众力量建立起来的。产房一般都是利用现有的房子或发动社员利用废料修建，设备因陋就简，一般家具、药物、器材大都由农业社自备或由卫生部门赠送、租借。接生员有的由卫生部门派来，有的由农业社自己训练，她们都具有一定的妇婴卫生和新法接生知识。产院收费低廉，产妇住院一般只要自带粮食和被褥。有的产院还给产妇其他各种方便，如产妇有离不开身的小孩，也可以带往产院，由产院负责照顾，减少产妇的牵挂。
