Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th – The 1.6 million workers of Shanghai, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, are increasing the strength to defend world peace and strike against the US-British aggressors with greater leaps forward in production and greater achievements.

　　In the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, three converters are spewing out intense flames. Enraged by the Anglo-American acts of aggression, the steelworkers, braving the July heat and the high temperatures in front of the furnace, are closely watching the flames. This morning, the first shift of workers set a new shift record by blowing seventy heats of steel in eight hours. Immediately afterwards, the second shift of workers surpassed the first shift with an even higher new record of blowing seventy-one heats of steel in eight hours. Workers in the open hearth furnace workshop, who normally take more than four and a half hours to smelt a heat of steel, only took three hours and forty-eight minutes to smelt a heat of steel this morning.

　　The workers of the Xinhu Steel Plant, which is producing steel for the people of the Middle East, completed a batch of round steel orders nine days ahead of schedule, and are now actively trying to prepare another batch of steel that was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, to be completed one week ahead of schedule.

　　The workers of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, who are striving to catch up with the quality level of British tires, successfully trial-produced rickshaw tires without cord yesterday, reducing the cost by 5%. A major innovation of vulcanizing rickshaw tires without water tires has also been successfully tested and can save 200,000 yuan within half a year. The worker's philosophical theory group of this factory also wrote twenty-seven wall posters during yesterday's study time to condemn the shameless acts of aggression of imperialism.

    增强和平力量打击侵略者
    上海工人加紧生产提前完成中东订货
    新华社上海19日电  具有反帝斗争传统的上海一百六十万工人，正以生产上更大的跃进和更大的成就来增加保卫世界和平的力量，打击美英侵略者。
    在上海第一钢铁厂的第一转炉车间里，三座转炉喷吐着强烈的火焰。被英美侵略行为激怒了的炼钢工人们，冒着7月的酷热和炉前的高温，紧张地注视着火焰。今天早晨第一班工人以八小时吹炼七十炉钢，首先创造了班新纪录。紧接着第二班工人又以八小时吹炼七十一炉钢的更高新成绩超过了第一班。平炉车间工人平时炼一炉钢要四小时半以上，今天早上只用了三小时四十八分钟时间就炼出一炉钢。
    正在为中东人民生产钢材的新沪钢铁厂提前九天完成了一批圆钢订货，今天又在积极设法准备再把一批本来要到本月底才能完成的钢材，提前一个星期完成。
    正在猛赶英国轮胎质量水平的正泰橡胶厂工人，昨天试制成功了不用帘布的力车胎，使成本降低5％。力车胎不用水胎硫化的重大革新也已试验成功，半年内即可节约二十万元。这个厂的工人哲学理论小组在昨天的学习时间内，还写了二十七首墙头诗来斥责帝国主义的无耻的侵略行为。（附图片）
