Oppose the United States' Instigation of South Vietnam's Invasion of Cambodia
By Our Staff Commentator

The invasion of Cambodia by the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem troops has attracted the attention of all those concerned about peace in Indochina. According to reports, since June 18, large numbers of regular troops from the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique have invaded the northeastern Cambodian province of Stung Treng, occupying places such as Pa Ngneung and Pa Teuva in the province, at least fifteen kilometers from the border. Former Cambodian Prime Minister Sim Var pointed out that the South Vietnamese troops are still reinforcing their forces and actively deploying, attempting to launch a deep offensive. To this end, Cambodian King Suramarit issued a statement on June 25, condemning the South Vietnamese troops for invading Cambodia and requesting support from countries friendly to Cambodia to stop South Vietnam's aggression.

According to Cambodian newspapers, since the beginning of 1957, South Vietnamese troops have invaded Cambodian territory as many as twenty-nine times; the Cambodian government has repeatedly protested, but the South Vietnamese side has ignored them. In early June this year, Saigon's official newspapers launched a malicious campaign attacking Cambodia and its policy of peaceful neutrality; this was immediately followed by large-scale military invasion. It is clear that South Vietnam's attack on Cambodia is a planned act of aggression. This is not only a blatant violation of Cambodia's independence and sovereignty, but also poses a serious threat to peace in Indochina.

The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique dares to launch a military offensive against Cambodia so blatantly because someone is backing them. This is the force of American imperialism. The United States originally intended to play only the role of instigator behind the scenes in this incident, so it remained "silent" at the beginning of the incident. But when Cambodia made the incident public to world opinion and requested the International Commission for Cambodia to conduct an investigation, the instigator could no longer hide behind the scenes.

It is no secret that since the restoration of peace in Indochina in July 1954, the United States has been using the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique as its tool to obstruct Vietnam's peaceful reunification and create tension in Indochina. Similarly, it is well known that the United States has long expressed dissatisfaction with Cambodia's policy of peaceful neutrality. Therefore, in recent years, the United States has continuously instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to blockade and invade the Cambodian border, attempting to use this to force Cambodia to abandon its policy of peaceful neutrality. This time, the United States' instigation of South Vietnamese troops to invade Cambodian territory is not only a means of pressure, but also an open act of aggression.

The Cambodian government and people are determined to safeguard their independence and territorial integrity. The Cambodian National Assembly and the Council of the Kingdom recently stated firmly in a declaration that if the United States cannot stop South Vietnam's aggression, Cambodia will take all measures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are confident that the Cambodian people's struggle against aggression will surely achieve final victory; because justice is on the side of the Cambodian people, and the peace-loving people of all countries stand on the side of the Cambodian people.

    反对美国唆使南越进犯柬埔寨
    本报评论员
    南越吴庭艳军队对邻国柬埔寨的进犯，已经引起了所有关心印度支那和平的人们的注意。据消息报道，从6月18日以来，南越吴庭艳集团的大批正规军侵入了柬埔寨东北部的上丁省，占领了该省的帕内和帕特杜瓦等地方，距离边境至少有十五公里。柬埔寨前首相沈法指出，目前，南越军队还在加强兵力、积极部署，企图发动纵深进攻。为此，柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特于6月25日发表声明，谴责南越军队侵入柬埔寨；并且要求同柬埔寨友好的国家予以支持，制止南越的侵略。
    据柬埔寨报纸透露，自从1957年年初以来，南越军队侵入柬埔寨领土先后已达二十九次之多；柬埔寨政府一再提出抗议，南越方面置之不理。今年6月初，西贡的官方报纸展开了一个恶意攻击柬埔寨和它的和平中立政策的运动；随即发生了大规模的军事侵犯行动。由此可见，南越对柬埔寨的进攻是一种有计划的侵略行为。这不但是对柬埔寨的独立和主权的粗暴侵犯，而且也造成了对印度支那和平的严重威胁。
    南越吴庭艳集团敢于这样明目张胆地对柬埔寨发动军事进攻，是因为有人在背后为它撑腰。这就是美国帝国主义势力。美国在这事件中原打算只居于幕后唆使者的地位，所以在事件发生之初一直保持“沉默”。但是当柬埔寨把事件公之于世界舆论，并要求柬埔寨国际委员会进行调查时，这个唆使者就无法在幕后隐藏了。
    美国自从1954年7月印度支那和平恢复以来，一直把南越吴庭艳集团当作它的阻碍越南恢复和平统一和在印度支那制造紧张局势的工具，这早已不是什么秘密了。同样的，美国对于柬埔寨奉行的和平中立政策，早就表示不满，这也是人所共知的了。所以，近几年来，美国曾不断唆使吴庭艳集团封锁和侵犯柬埔寨边境，企图借此来压迫柬埔寨放弃它的和平中立政策。这次美国唆使南越军队侵犯柬埔寨领土，不仅是一种压力手段，而且是公开的侵略行为。
    柬埔寨政府和人民决心维护自己的独立和领土主权的完整。柬埔寨国民议会和王国会议最近在发表的一项宣言中坚决表示：如果美国不能阻止南越的侵略行动，柬埔寨就要采取一切措施来保卫它的主权和领土完整。我们确信，柬埔寨人民反侵略的斗争必将取得最后胜利；因为正义在柬埔寨人民这一边，各国爱好和平人民也都是站在柬埔寨人民这一边。
