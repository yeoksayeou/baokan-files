Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 8th. Albanian Minister of Construction, Pashiqo, said that Albania's housing construction is developing very rapidly. Currently, the new housing built in Albania on average every nineteen days is equal to the total number of new houses built throughout the entire year of 1938 before liberation.

Pashiqo said that compared with 1949 to 1950, from 1956 to the present, the average annual total number of houses built in Albania has increased to more than 7.8 times that of that time; during the period from 1951 to 1955, the average annual number of houses built had already increased to more than 4.3 times that of that time.

Before the establishment of the people's regime, Albania's construction industry and people's living conditions were very backward. During the Italian and German fascist occupation, more than 61,000 houses were burned down, which caused a serious housing shortage. After liberation, the people's regime attached great importance to improving the people's living conditions. By the end of last year, the state had built more than 800,000 square meters of new housing for the people. In 1957 alone, the new houses built by the construction enterprises under the Ministry of Construction were equal to 18 times the number of new houses built in 1938. Now, calculated on the basis of the national population, on average, less than two people can be allocated one square meter of new housing. Pashiqo said that after the start of the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the scale of housing construction in Albania has become even larger. The total area of housing construction during this five-year plan will increase by 35% compared with the first five-year plan.

He said that with the rapid development of housing construction, Albania's original cities have been greatly expanded, and 24 new cities and residential centers have emerged. In this way, the urban population of Albania alone increased by 53.4% from 1950 to 1955, while in Vlora, where new houses have been built in continuous areas, the population has rapidly doubled.

    十九天等于过去一年
    阿尔巴尼亚住宅建筑很快
    据新华社地拉那8日电  阿尔巴尼亚建设部部长帕希科说，阿尔巴尼亚的住宅建设发展十分迅速。目前阿尔巴尼亚平均在每十九天内建筑的新住宅就等于解放前1938年全年建成的新住宅总数。
    帕希科说，同1949年至1950年比较，从1956年到现在，阿尔巴尼亚平均每年建设的住宅总数增加为那时的七点八倍以上；在1951年至1955年期间，每年平均建设的住宅已经增加为那时的四点三倍以上。
    在人民政权建立以前，阿尔巴尼亚的建筑工业和人民居住条件是十分落后的。在意大利和德国法西斯占领期间，又有六万一千多幢住宅被焚毁，这就造成了严重的房荒。解放后，人民政权很重视改善人民的居住条件。到去年年底，国家已经为人民建造了八十多万平方公尺的新住宅。1957年，单是建设部所属的建筑企业建造的新住宅就等于1938年新建住宅的十八倍。现在，按全国人口计算，平均不到两个人就可以分配到一平方公尺的新住宅。帕希科说，在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）开始以后，阿尔巴尼亚的住宅建筑规模更大了。这一五年计划期间的住宅建筑总面积将比第一个五年计划期间增加35％。
    他说，随着住宅建设的迅速发展，目前阿尔巴尼亚原有的城市已经大大扩大了，同时还出现了二十四个新的城市和住宅中心。这样，阿尔巴尼亚全国城市的人口仅从1950至1955年就增加了53.4％，而在新住宅连片建成的发罗那城，人口已经迅速地增加了两倍。
