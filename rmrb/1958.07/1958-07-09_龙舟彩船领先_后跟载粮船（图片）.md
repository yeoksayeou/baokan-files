Having reaped a bumper harvest of early rice, the farmers of Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, are jubilantly delivering public grain. On the rivers and roads leading to the various granaries, a mighty stream of grain-transporting teams is flowing endlessly. People are joyfully beating gongs and drums, playing Chaozhou music, and carrying large banners, sending cart after cart and boat after boat of grain to the granaries.
