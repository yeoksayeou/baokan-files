    China's Largest Steel Plant
    Wuhan Steel Plant Begins Construction Ahead of Schedule

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 16th: China's current largest steel plant, the Wuhan Steel Plant, officially started construction yesterday.

    This steel plant was designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union using the latest advanced technology and is one of the world's top-tier steel plants. It is quite large in scale, including nine large open-hearth furnaces, one pig iron mixer, and more than twenty auxiliary engineering projects. Its open-hearth furnaces will all be equipped with highly mechanized and automated equipment; material transportation, charging, and ingot mold arrangement will all be operated by various machines; furnace temperature regulation and steelmaking condition inspection will all use automatic control equipment and instruments.

    The workers started construction on this steel plant ahead of schedule in order to accelerate the pace at which China's steel production catches up with Britain. According to the original plan, the first phase of the project was to be completed in 1962; now the workers have decided to carry out the two phases of the project together, put it all into production in 1960, and ensure the best project quality with the least investment.

    我国目前最大的炼钢厂
    武钢炼钢厂提前兴建
    据新华社武汉16日电　我国目前最大的炼钢厂——武钢炼钢厂昨天正式开工建设了。
    这座钢厂是苏联帮助我国用最新的先进技术设计的，是世界第一流的钢厂之一。它的规模相当大，包括九座大平炉，一座混铁炉和二十多个辅助工程项目。它的平炉都将安设高度机械化自动化的装备，运料、装料和整理钢锭模等，都由各种机械操纵；调节炉内温度和检查炼钢情况，都用自动控制设备和仪表。
    这座钢厂是职工们为了使我国的钢产量尽速赶上英国而提前开工兴建的。按原定计划，它的第一期工程要到1962年建成；现在职工们决定：两期工程合在一起进行，1960年全部投入生产，而且保证用最少的投资达到最好的工程质量。
