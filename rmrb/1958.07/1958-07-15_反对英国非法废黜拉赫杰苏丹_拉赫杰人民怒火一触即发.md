Xinhua News Agency dispatches: British troops are preparing to take action against the people of the Lahej Sultanate in the "Western Aden Protectorate" because they oppose Britain's plan to have Lahej join the British-planned Federation of South Arabia and make it a permanent British military base.

Britain's attempt to force Lahej to accept the "Federation" plan has failed. It initially attempted to arrest the Sultan of Lahej, who was negotiating with the British government in London. After discovering that he had fled to Italy, the British government announced the Sultan's deposition, even though the Sultan was elected by the Lahej Administrative Council and the British government had no right to depose him.

Britain's actions have caused widespread anger in Lahej. The people of Lahej launched a general strike and market strike on the 11th.

Meanwhile, according to a report in Cairo's "Al-Ahram" on the 13th, sources from Lahej said that tribal leaders of the Lahej Sultanate held a meeting to condemn the illegal decision of Britain to exile Sultan Karim Al-Aidrus, and pledged to support his struggle for the independence of the Lahej Sultanate.

The Acting Sultan of Lahej, Ali Amer, who is currently in charge of the affairs of the Lahej Sultanate, also supports Sultan Al-Aidrus, despite British pressure on him to succeed his cousin as Sultan.

"Al-Ahram" also said that Sultan Al-Aidrus of Lahej is currently in contact with the King of Yemen, who has welcomed Sultan Al-Aidrus to reside in Yemen. According to a report in Cairo's "Al-Masaa" on the 11th, Sultan Al-Aidrus will visit Cairo soon.

In view of the imminent eruption of the anger of the people of Lahej, the British Governor of Aden, Luce, who was on vacation in London, hurriedly returned to Lahej by plane on the 13th. At London Airport, he hinted that if trouble broke out, the army would be used to deal with it.

    反对英国非法废黜拉赫杰苏丹
    拉赫杰人民怒火一触即发
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国军队准备对“西部亚丁保护地”的拉赫杰酋长国人民采取行动，因为他们反对英国要拉赫杰参加英国策划中的西亚丁联邦和使它成为英国的永久军事基地的计划。
    英国强使拉赫杰接受“联邦”计划的企图已经失败。它最初曾经企图逮捕在伦敦同英国政府进行谈判的拉赫杰苏丹，在发现他已经逃往意大利之后，英国政府竟宣布废黜苏丹，虽然苏丹是由拉赫杰行政委员会选举出来的，英国政府根本无权予以废黜。
    英国的行动在拉赫杰国内引起了普遍的愤怒。拉赫杰人民已在11日实行总罢工总罢市。
    同时，据开罗“金字塔报”13日报道，据来自拉赫杰的人士说，拉赫杰酋长国的部落领袖开会谴责英国流放卡里姆·阿里德苏丹的非法决定，并保证声援他进行争取拉赫杰酋长国的独立的斗争。
    目前负责拉赫杰酋长国事务的拉赫杰代理苏丹阿里·阿密尔也支持阿里德苏丹，尽管英国对他施加压力，要他继任他的表兄弟苏丹的职位。
    “金字塔报”还说，拉赫杰的苏丹阿里德目前同也门国王进行联系，也门国王欢迎阿里德苏丹住在也门。据开罗“晚报”11日报道阿里德苏丹不久将访问开罗。
    鉴于拉赫杰人民怒火的爆发已经迫在眉睫，在伦敦度假的英国驻亚丁总督卢斯13日乘飞机匆匆提前赶回拉赫杰。他在伦敦机场暗示说，要是出乱子就用军队来对付。
