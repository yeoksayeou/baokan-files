    Major Problems in Early Rice Harvesting
    Premature Harvesting and Careless Threshing Result in Alarming Losses
    (Reported by our newspaper) The CCP Hunan Provincial Committee of Changde Prefecture convened an emergency telephone conference, pointing out that rice stalks not being thoroughly threshed and harvesting early rice before it is mature are new problems that must be given serious attention in the current early rice harvest.
    This problem was discovered by a person in charge from the Prefectural Committee while inspecting harvesting work in Changde County. On the afternoon of the 16th, while inspecting 2.5 mu of early rice fields that had been harvested by the first team of the Qianjin Cooperative, it was discovered that the rice stalks that had been mixed with grain were not thoroughly threshed. Two stalks were taken back and re-threshed, yielding a total of ten liang of dried grain. This plot of land had 661 stalks, averaging about 80 jin of grain per mu that had not been threshed. The Prefectural Committee believes this is an alarming loss; if the stalks are not thoroughly threshed across the entire region's 5.54 million mu of early rice, more than 400 million jin of rice will be lost on the stalks. Local township and cooperative cadres were moving back and forth in the fields but did not notice this problem. On the same afternoon, in the Zaoguo Cooperative in the suburbs of Changde City, a person in charge from the Prefectural Committee saw cooperative members harvesting a field of early rice that had not yet matured. According to investigations, harvesting prematurely like this results in a loss of over 100 jin of dried grain per mu.
    The Prefectural Committee introduced the problems existing in the harvesting of these two cooperatives at the telephone conference, pointing out that careful harvesting and thorough threshing are the last crucial issues in striving for a bumper early rice harvest. In order to quickly stop the wasteful phenomena in harvesting, the Prefectural Committee requires that all counties first educate the broad masses of cadres and people on the importance of this issue ideologically. Each township and cooperative must establish inspection committees and also formulate reward and punishment systems for careful harvesting and thorough threshing.

    早稻收割中的大问题
    提早收割和收打不细的损失惊人
    本报讯　中共湖南省常德地委召开紧急电话会议，指出禾把打得不干净和早稻没有成熟就收割，是当前收割早稻中要引起高度注意的新问题。
    这个问题是地委负责人在常德县检查收割工作中发现的。16日下午，在前进社第一队检查二亩五分收割完毕的早稻田，发现拌过谷的禾把都打得不干净，当时就带回两个禾把重打一次，共打出十两干谷。这一丘田有六百六十一个禾把，平均每亩田即有八十斤左右的谷没有打下来。地委认为这是一个惊人的损失，全区五百五十四万亩早稻，如果禾把打不干净，就要有四亿多斤稻谷丢失在禾把上。而当地乡、社干部在田里来来往往，都没有注意这个问题。同一天下午，在常德市郊区皂果社，地委负责人看到社员在收割一丘还没成熟的早稻。据调查，像这样过早收割，每亩田要少收一百多斤干谷。
    地委在电话会议上介绍了这两个社在收割中存在的问题，指出细收细打是争取早稻丰收的最后一个关键问题。为了迅速制止收割中的浪费现象，地委要求各县首先要从思想上教育广大干部和群众重视这个问题。各乡、社都要成立检查委员会，还要订出细收细打的奖惩制度。
