    Northeast Paddy Fields Can Now Yield Two Harvests a Year
    Yingkou County's Experiment with Barley and Rice Double Cropping a Success
    (Our dispatch) Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, has shattered the age-old superstition that northeast paddy fields cannot produce two crops a year. This year, for the first time, they harvested the first crop – barley – from 15,000 mu (Chinese acres) of paddy fields. Now, the barley has been completely harvested, and rice transplanting has begun. According to actual measurements, the average yield of barley per mu is over 260 jin, and the highest yield is over 500 jin per mu.
    For over forty years, ever since Yingkou County had paddy fields, it has been a single-crop area. After the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the county's paddy field area has developed to over 400,000 mu, accounting for over 60% of the total cultivated land area. In order to achieve this year's leap forward targets, the Yingkou County Party Committee considered increasing the multiple cropping index a significant potential for increased production. Therefore, the County Party Committee decided to carry out the double cropping of rice and barley as an experiment. When this decision was first proposed, it was opposed by some people who believed that: the climate in the northeast is cold, the early seedlings would definitely freeze to death, and it would affect the transplanting of rice in the next season. It would be better to eat the seeds as grain, to avoid wasting them. In response to these ideas, the County Party Committee launched a major debate in the paddy field areas. The County Party Committee also conducted an experiment on one mu of land in Gouyan Township, with a total growing period of 110 days from sowing to harvest.
    The Yingkou County Party Committee plans to widely promote double cropping in paddy fields throughout the county next year, and on July 9th, it held an on-site meeting, organizing responsible cadres from various townships and communes to visit the barley that was trial-planted this year.

### 东北水田也能一年两收  营口县试验大麦水稻两季连作成功

    东北水田也能一年两收
    营口县试验大麦水稻两季连作成功
    本报讯　辽宁省营口县打破亘古以来东北水田不能种二季的迷信，今年第一次在一万五千亩（市亩，下同）水田里收获了第一季作物——大麦。现在，大麦全部收割完毕，水稻开始插秧。根据实打实测，大麦平均每亩产二百六十多斤，高的每亩达五百多斤。
    营口县自从有水田以来，四十多年来一直是单季作。农业大跃进以后，全县水田面积发展到了四十多万亩，占总耕地面积60％以上。中共营口县委为实现今年的跃进指标，增加复种指数是一项很大的增产潜力。于是，县委便决定要搞水稻和大麦二季连作，作为试验。这个决定刚刚提出时，曾遭到一部分人的反对，他们认为：东北气候寒冷，早出的禾苗一定得冻死，并且影响下季水稻插秧，不如把种子当粮吃了，免得白扔掉。县委针对这些思想，在水田地区展开了大辩论。县委并且在沟沿乡搞了一亩试验田，从播种到收获整个生育期为一百一十天。
    中共营口县委计划明年在全县普遍推广水田二季作，并于7月9日召开现场会议，组织全县各乡、社负责干部参观了今年试种的大麦。
