The Disaster Caused by the 1933 Yellow River Flood Peak

At 23:30 on July 17th, the Huayuankou station of the Yellow River experienced an extraordinary flood peak of 21,000 cubic meters per second, similar to the flood situation in 1933. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, a million-strong flood prevention army along the river has conquered this flood, ensuring the safety of tens of millions of people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and safeguarding the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction. In contrast, when the major flood occurred in 1933, due to the traitorous and harmful rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were unwilling to seriously build dikes and unable to lead the masses in defending the dike lines, the dike lines in the river sections reached by the flood peak collapsed and overflowed, causing severe disasters.

The different outcomes of these two flood peaks are a stark contrast between two different social systems.

The situation of the 1933 flood and the disasters it caused were as follows: In July and August 1933, continuous torrential rains fell in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and mountain floods erupted everywhere, with floodwaters fiercely converging into the main stream and its tributaries of the Yellow River. At that time, river channels in Ningxia, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and other provinces and regions overflowed, dikes collapsed, and major floods occurred.

After the confluence of the main stream and tributary floods of the Yellow River, a flood peak of 22,000 cubic meters per second appeared at the Shanxian station on August 10th of that year. After the flood peak appeared, the middle reaches of the Yellow River were first hit by the disaster. After the flood peak entered the downstream river section, it rampaged even more, and the dikes collapsed one after another. On the north bank of Henan Province, 18 sections of the Wenxian dike were breached by the flood; after the collapse of the dike in Wuzhi County, the flood rushed into the Qin River and backflowed into the Old Dragon Bay of the Qin River; and overflowed near the Zhandian Station of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. Floods also occurred in the Gongxian and Xingyang areas on the south bank.

The situation below the Zhengzhou Bridge of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway was even worse. On the north bank, there were 39 breaches and overflows. Six sections of the Changyuan County section of the Taihang Dike were breached, and 33 breaches and overflows occurred in a 23-kilometer-long section from Dacheji to Shitouzhuan on the Lin-Huang Dike. Among them, Shitouzhuan and Xiangtingkou had the most outflow, almost causing a change in the river's course. The Changyuan breach flood submerged Changyuan, Hua County, Puyang, and Fan County and Shou Zhang counties in Shandong Province, to the north and south of the Taihang Dike and east of the Jin Dike.

On the south bank, after the flood overflowed the dike line northwest of Xiaopangzhuang in Lankao County, it submerged Lankao County; at the same time, it breached the Xiaoxin Dike and Simingtang Dike sections in the Tongwaxiang area. The flood first submerged the then-Kao City, and then overflowed southeast along the old course of the Yellow River before 1855. After the confluence of the Xiaopangzhuang and Simingtang floods, it submerged Dongming County and overflowed Heze, Juye, Yuncheng, Cao County, Shan County, Jiaxiang, and Jining in Shandong Province. When this main stream rushed to Gaozhai and Panlongji in Dangshan County, Jiangsu Province, it was blocked by the old dike across the river, and the flood turned north, rushing into Weishan Lake along the Dasha River in Feng County and Pei County, and broke into Nanyang Lake.

That flood affected 67 counties in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu and other provinces and regions. In the downstream Henan Province section alone, there were 62 breaches and overflows; the affected area in Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces reached 34,600 square kilometers, of which 12,792 square kilometers were severely affected. According to the investigation and statistics of the puppet Yellow River Conservancy Commission alone, 9,224 villages were submerged in this flood, with 3,642,514 victims, 18,293 casualties, 63,639 livestock lost, and 1,685,369 houses destroyed. The actual losses must be greater than this number. As for the loss of property and crops, it is impossible to estimate.

    一九三三年的黄河洪峰造成的灾害
    7月17日23点半，黄河花园口站出现了二万一千秒公方流量的特大洪峰，和1933年的洪水情况差不多。但是共产党领导沿河百万防汛大军战胜了这次洪水，保障了黄河下游数千万人民的安全，保障了祖国社会主义建设的顺利进行。而1933年发生大洪水时，却因卖国殃民的国民党反动统治，不肯认真修筑堤坝，不能领导群众防守堤线，以致洪峰所到的河段，堤线纷纷溃决漫溢，造成了惨重的灾害。
    这两次洪峰的不同结果，是两种不同社会制度的鲜明的对照。
    1933年洪水的情况和它造成的灾情是：1933年7、8月间，黄河中游地区连降暴雨，各地山洪暴发，洪水猛烈地向黄河干流和它的支流汇流。当时的宁夏、绥远、内蒙古、陕西等省区河道漫溢，堤防溃决，都发生了大水灾。
    黄河干支洪水汇流后，当年8月10日就在陕县站出现了二万二千秒公方流量的洪峰。洪峰出现后，黄河中游首先被灾。洪峰进入下游河段以后，更是横冲直撞，堤坝纷纷崩溃。河南省北岸大堤的温县堤段，被洪水冲决十八处；武陟县堤防崩溃后，洪水冲入沁河，倒灌到沁河老龙湾；并在京广铁路詹店车站附近漫溢。南岸巩县、荥阳县一带，也发生了洪水泛滥。
    京广铁路郑州大桥以下，情况更坏。北岸，溃决漫溢三十九处。太行堤长垣县堤段被突破六处，临黄大堤大车集到石头庄二十三公里长的一段，就溃决漫溢三十三处。其中石头庄和香亭口门出水最多，几乎造成改道局势。长垣决口洪水，淹没了太行堤南北和金堤以东的长垣、滑县、濮阳和山东省的范县、寿张等县。
    南岸，洪水漫过兰考县小庞庄西北的堤线后，淹了兰考县城；同时冲决铜瓦厢一带的小新堤和四明堂堤段，洪水首先淹了当时的考城，又顺着1855年前的黄河故道往东南泛滥。小庞庄和四明堂两股洪水汇流后，淹没了东明县，又漫淹山东省的菏泽、巨野、郓城、曹县、单县、嘉祥、济宁。这股主流奔腾到江苏省的砀山县高砦和盘龙集时，被拦河旧堤挡住，洪水就转向北流，沿丰县和沛县的大沙河冲入微山湖，并闯进南阳湖。
    那次洪水泛滥，受灾的有宁夏、内蒙古、陕西、山西、河南、山东、江苏等省区的六十七个县，仅下游的河南省堤段就溃决漫溢六十二处；河南、山东、江苏三省受灾的面积即达三万四千六百平方公里，其中灾情严重的有一万二千七百九十二平方公里。仅据伪黄河水利委员会调查统计：这次淹没村庄就有九千二百二十四个，受灾人口三百六十四万二千五百一十四名，伤亡人口一万八千二百九十三名，损失牲畜六万三千六百三十九头，冲毁房屋一百六十八万五千三百六十九间。实际上的损失，一定要多于这个数目的。至于财物和农作物的损失更是无法统计。
