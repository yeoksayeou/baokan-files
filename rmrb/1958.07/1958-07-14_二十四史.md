The Twenty-Four Histories
Mo Xi

"Where does one begin with a history of the twenty-four dynasties?" is an old saying. It is said that after Wen Tianxiang was captured by the Yuan Dynasty and sent to Beijing, the Yuan Dynasty's丞相 (Prime Minister)孛罗 (Boluo) asked him a question: "Since Pangu, how many emperors and kings have there been in total?" The meaning was to get him to surrender to the Yuan Dynasty. Wen Tianxiang replied, "Where does one begin with a history of the seventeen dynasties!" Thus, he rebutted Boluo's words. Originally, the Song Dynasty explicitly stipulated that there were only seventeen histories: the Records of the Grand Historian, the Book of Han, the Book of the Later Han, the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the Book of Jin, the Book of Song, the Book of Southern Qi, the Book of Liang, the Book of Chen, the Book of Wei, the Book of Northern Qi, the Book of Zhou, the Book of Sui, the History of the Southern Dynasties, the History of the Northern Dynasties, the New Book of Tang, and the New History of the Five Dynasties. Later, the Ming Dynasty's supervised edition added the histories of the Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, called the Twenty-One Histories. In 1739 (the fourth year of Qianlong), the History of Ming was completed, and along with the Old Book of Tang and the Old History of the Five Dynasties, it formed the Twenty-Four Histories. Wen Tianxiang is a heroic figure worshiped by the people, and his famous words have become a widely circulated idiom, used to express the complexity of a problem, and changing seventeen histories into twenty-four histories.

How many volumes are there in the Twenty-Four Histories? Its total number of volumes is two thousand two hundred and forty, with more than twenty-seven million words. The more commonly used version now is the Wuying Hall edition, printed under the order of Hongli (Qianlong), abbreviated as the "Hall Edition."

Before liberation, the Twenty-Five Histories of the Kaiming Bookstore was a photolithographic reprint of the "Hall Edition" of the Twenty-Four Histories, plus Ke Shaoyun's "New History of Yuan." The Commercial Press once collected earlier and better versions of each history and printed them together, called the "Hundred Patches Edition" because it included versions from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

The first book of the Twenty-Four Histories is Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, which records the facts from the Five Emperors to the Han Dynasty. It is a general history in nature, including five parts: Annals, Hereditary Houses, Biographies, Treatises, and Tables, which can also be said to be five genres. The Annals record the deeds of emperors; the Hereditary Houses record the lives of feudal lords or nobles; the Biographies include some officials, scholar-officials, and figures admired by Sima Qian (such as the Biographies of Knights-Errant), as well as some facts about ethnic minorities; the Treatises specifically record the political, economic, and geographical conditions and various institutions; the Tables use tabular forms to summarize and explain the overall picture of issues, such as the "Genealogical Table of the Three Dynasties" and the "Chronological Table of Generals and Ministers Since the Rise of the Han Dynasty." The Treatises and Tables complement the Annals, Biographies, and Hereditary Houses, playing a mutually supplementary role. Later historians learned from Sima Qian's example, reduced the Hereditary Houses, and changed the Treatises to Monographs, called the "Annals-Biographies-Monographs-Tables" format. Ban Gu's "Book of Han" is like this. The Book of Han added a Treatise on Literature and Art, creating a list of the works of the previous dynasties up to that time, explaining the origins of scholarship, and setting a precedent for later histories (some histories are not called Treatise on Literature and Art, but Treatise on Classics). From the Book of Han onwards, each history recorded the historical facts of one dynasty, so it is also called dynastic history, to distinguish it from general history that is not limited to one dynasty.

The entire Twenty-Four Histories records the events of past dynasties in terms of economy, politics, society, and culture, and is one of China's important cultural heritages. It tortuously reflects the class struggle and some of the true lives of the people of past dynasties; materials related to the internal contradictions of the ruling class are even more ubiquitous. Why say "tortuously reflect"? Because after Yang Jian (Emperor Wen of Sui) banned private history writing in the sixth century, the compilation of history books became genuine official works. The imperial court set up officials to compile history, generally supervised by the prime minister of the current dynasty. These historians had to be cautious and follow the emperor's intentions, praising the emperor's literary and military achievements, obliterating the people's achievements, distorting the facts of class struggle, vilifying the image of peasant uprising leaders, and using feudal moral standards to commend and criticize figures. Emphasizing orthodoxy and discussing historical methods, in a word, it was to consolidate the feudal ruling regime through history writing. Therefore, although the Twenty-Four Histories contain rich historical materials, these materials have been selected and greatly distorted, and must be critically analyzed when used. Conversely, if we master the Marxist-Leninist class analysis, many materials can be transformed from decay to magic, and can have a positive or negative educational effect.

This vast collection of historical materials is mainly for people to look up today, and it is not necessary to read each chapter in detail except for experts. For checking people and events, the "Index of Personal Names in the Twenty-Five Histories" compiled by the Kaiming Bookstore and Liang Qixiong's "Index of Biography Titles in the Twenty-Four Histories" are available for use. In the past two years, the Commercial Press has compiled the classics, treatises, and literary arts of each history, added materials outside the Twenty-Four Histories, and compiled separate title and author indexes, making checking much more convenient. The "Compilation of Biographies of Various Ethnic Groups Throughout History" recently published by the Zhonghua Book Company collects materials related to ethnic minorities in the Twenty-Four Histories. This method of compiling materials saves researchers a lot of time and effort in searching for books.

There are also many wonderfully written articles in the Twenty-Four Histories, which are not only historical materials, but can also be read as literary works. For example, the "Biography of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru" in the Records of the Grand Historian is an example, which is the earliest blueprint for the famous drama "Generals Make Peace." For young readers, it is also beneficial to selectively read some with the guidance of teachers. In the past, some people regarded the Twenty-Four Histories as something sacred and inviolable, but this is just deception. We must deal with cultural heritage with an attitude of breaking superstitions and liberating our minds, and the Twenty-Four Histories are no exception.

    二十四史
    默希
    “一部二十四史从何说起”，是一句老话。据说文天祥被元朝俘虏送到北京以后，元朝的丞相孛罗对他提出了一个问题：“自从盘古以来，一共有几帝几王？”意思是要他投降元朝。文天祥回答说，“一部十七史从何说起！”这样把孛罗的话顶了回去。原来宋朝明令规定的，只有十七史，就是史记、汉书、后汉书、三国志、晋书、宋书、南齐书、梁书、陈书、魏书、北齐书、周书、隋书、南史、北史、新唐书和新五代史。以后明代监本，又加上宋辽金元四史，称为二十一史。1739年
  （乾隆四年）明史修成，加上旧唐书、旧五代史，合成二十四史。文天祥是人民群众所崇拜的英雄人物，他的名言也变成了一句流传很广的成语，用来表示问题的复杂性。并且把十七史改成二十四史。
    一部二十四史究竟有多少？它的总卷数是二千二百四十卷，字数在二千七百万以上。现在比较通行的本子是在弘历（乾隆）的命令下刊刻的武英殿本，简称“殿本”。
    解放前开明书店的二十五史就是以“殿本”二十四史影印，加上柯绍忞的“新元史”。商务印书馆曾搜集各史较早较好的本子，汇印一起，因为包括宋元明清各本，所以叫做“百衲本”。
    二十四史的第一部书是司马迁的史记，它记载了五帝到汉代的事实，是通史的性质，包括本纪、世家、列传、书、表五个部分，也可以说是五种体裁。本纪是帝王的事迹；世家是写诸侯或贵族的生平；列传包括一些官僚士大夫和司马迁所欣赏的人物（如游侠列传），以及一部分少数民族的事实；书，专门记载政治、经济、地理的状况和各项典章制度；表，是用表格形式来总纳和说明问题的全貌，如
  “三代世表”、“汉兴以来将相名臣年表”都是。书、表和纪、传、世家是相辅而成的，起着互相补充的作用。后来写史的人，学司马迁的先例，减去世家，把书改叫志，称为“表志纪传体”。班固的“汉书”，就是这样的。汉书里增加了艺文志，对前代至当时的著述，开了一个清单，说明学术源流，给后来各史开了先例（有的史不叫艺文志，叫经籍志）。从汉书起的各史，都是记载一代的史实，所以又叫做断代史，以区别于不限一代的通史。
    整部二十四史记载了历代经济、政治、社会、文化各方面的事迹，是我国重要的文化遗产之一。它曲折反映了阶级斗争和历代人民一部分真实的生活；有关统治阶级内部矛盾的材料，更是触目皆是。为什么要说曲折地反映呢？因为从六世纪杨坚（隋文帝）禁止私人修史以后，史书的编纂成了道地的官书。朝廷设官修史，一般都由当朝的宰相监修，那些史臣们必须战战兢兢秉承皇上的意旨，歌颂帝王的文治武功，抹煞人民的成就，歪曲阶级斗争的事实，丑化农民起义领袖的形象，用封建道德标准来褒贬人物。讲正统，论史法，一句话说，就是用修史来巩固封建统治的政权。因此，二十四史里虽含有丰富的史料，但这些材料是被挑选过的，也经过很大的歪曲，在利用之时要经过批判分析。反之，如果掌握了马列主义的阶级分析，许多材料可以从腐朽变为神奇，可以发生正面的或反面的教育作用。
    这部浩瀚的史料总集，在今天主要是供人翻查的，除专家以外，没有必要逐篇去细读。按人查事，有开明书店所编“二十五史人名索引”和梁启雄的“二十四史传目引得”可供利用。近两年来商务印书馆把各史的经籍艺文志辑录出来，附加二十四史以外的资料，并且另编了书名、作者索引，检查起来方便多了。中华书局最近出版的“历代各族传记汇编”，汇集二十四史内有关少数民族的资料。这种资料汇编的方法，为研究工作者节省了许多查书的时间和精力。
    二十四史中也有许多写得很精彩的文章，不仅是史料，也可作为文学作品去阅读。像史记的“廉颇蔺相如列传”就是一个例子，这就是有名的剧目“将相和”的最早的蓝本。对青年读者来说，如果在教师的指导之下，有重点的选读一些，也还有些好处。从前有人把二十四史当做神圣不可侵犯的东西，其实只是欺人之谈。我们要用破除迷信、解放思想的态度来处理文化遗产，对二十四史也不例外。
