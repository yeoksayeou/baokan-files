    Incurable Diseases Can Rejuvenate
    After studying the General Line, the doctors at the Dalian Health School Hospital eliminated their feelings of inferiority and actively sought effective treatments for difficult-to-treat diseases. For example, neurodermatitis, currently considered incurable, saw dermatologists create a new method based on the advanced Soviet experience of "Novocaine" block therapy. They creatively used a 45% alcohol solution alongside "Novocaine" for the block, achieving significant results. Of the ten patients treated, nine were basically cured and one improved. Surgeons adopted surface anesthesia to reduce patient discomfort during gastrointestinal decompression. Dentists innovated the pulpectomy method, reducing the completion time from four or five sessions to just two. Staff in the radiology department utilized waste materials to trial-produce a cardiac kymograph.
    This hospital also implemented the practice of sending technology to the countryside and doctors to grassroots levels to conduct disease prevention, control, and health education work, which was deeply welcomed by workers and residents.

    不治之症可以回春
    旅大市卫生学校医院的医生们学习了总路线后，破除了自卑感，对难以治疗的疾病积极寻找治疗良方。如神经性皮肤炎是目前不治之症，皮肤科的医生们根据苏联用“奴弗卡因”封闭疗法的先进经验，又创造性地运用45％的酒精与“奴弗卡因”同时封闭，效果显著，共治十名患者，九名基本治愈，一名好转。外科医生采用表麻减少病人做胃肠减压时的痛苦，口腔科的医生革新了牙髓切除的方法，过去用四五次完成，现在只用二次即可完成。放射线科的工作人员利用废品试制心脏记波摄影器。
    这个医院还实行了技术下乡、医生到基层去的办法，进行疾病防治和卫生宣传工作，深受工人和居民的欢迎。
