Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 19th. Petroleum workers in the Karamay mining area and railway workers excavating the Tianshan tunnel held rallies on the 18th in the mining area and on the construction site, respectively, to oppose the United States' aggression against Lebanon and Britain's aggression against Jordan, and to support the just struggle of the Arab people. On the afternoon of the 18th, 11,000 petroleum workers in the mining area held a rally against US imperialism's aggression against Lebanon and to celebrate the establishment of the Republic of Iraq. After the meeting, workers held a demonstration parade in the mining area.

More than 4,000 railway workers building the Tianshan Tunnel on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway held rallies and parades on the 18th in the towering Tianshan Mountains to oppose the United States' aggression against Lebanon. The construction site was plastered with slogans denouncing the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. Tao Zushen, a tunnel worker who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, said: If the US troops do not immediately withdraw from Lebanon and the British troops do not immediately withdraw from Jordan, they will certainly suffer the same disastrous defeat as they did on the Korean battlefield.

Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidam, 19th. More than 1,000 workers and PLA officers and soldiers in the Da Qaidam area gathered today to support the just struggle of the Arab people.

Li Mingxin, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC Qaidam Working Committee, angrily condemned the armed aggression of US and British imperialism in the Middle East at the meeting. He pointed out that in the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, the war adventures of imperialism are doomed to failure. Jiang Hanxun, the head of the PLA garrison, said that two years ago, British and French imperialism had experienced the iron fists of the Arab people, and now the aggressive claws of US and British imperialism will surely be cut off by the Arab people. Guo Youcai, a worker from the Qaidam Transportation Bureau, and Zhu Xia, chief engineer of the Qinghai Petroleum Prospecting Brigade, both expressed their determination to fully support the just struggle of the Arab people.
