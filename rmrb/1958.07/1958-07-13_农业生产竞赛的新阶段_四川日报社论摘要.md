Abridged editorial from the Sichuan Daily

The launch of a leap forward competition between Luxian and Jiangjin, and between Zhongxian and Pixian, involving the same conditions and the same crops, has opened a new chapter in the campaign of appraisal and competition in agricultural production. We strongly advocate this new type of competition and hope that more counties will participate in this competition, and that these leap forward competitions with the same conditions and the same crops will be carried out in the production of various crops. This will be of great benefit to promoting the high-speed increase in agricultural production in the entire province.

There are many benefits to carrying out leap forward competitions with the same conditions and the same crops. First, competing with the same crops makes the goals more specific and clear, making it easier to learn from each other, to summarize and exchange experiences, and to check and appraise. This is a good way to implement the leadership method of inspection and evaluation in a more concrete and better way. Second, carrying out same-crop competitions on a county-by-county basis can separately create typical experiences of large-area, high-yield crops; earnestly summarizing and promoting these experiences will inevitably strengthen the leadership of the entire agricultural production. Third, separately carrying out same-crop competitions for various crops can make high-yield crops even higher-yielding, and it can also enable so-called low-yield crops to rapidly become high-yield crops through competition, thereby winning a comprehensive and great harvest and a comprehensive leap forward for all crops. Fourth, the same crop plus the same conditions, that is, the competition is carried out under basically the same production conditions, the conditions are comparable, and the strengths are matched, which can better mobilize the enthusiasm of both sides of the competition and make people more actively participate in this competition. Because same-condition and same-crop competitions have many advantages, it is certain that this competition will rapidly, widely, deeply, and persistently develop throughout the province. Moreover, all localities can consider gradually extending this form of competition to aspects such as accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, making indigenous pesticides, improving tools, building water conservancy projects, transforming slopes, improving soil, planting trees, and afforestation, and using this leadership method to strengthen the leadership of various tasks.

Of course, the so-called "same conditions" competition does not advocate a theory of conditions only. The "conditions" referred to here mainly refer to the quality of soil, climate, and water conservancy conditions, as well as the level of the original crop yield. The quality of these conditions will affect the outcome of the competition. Therefore, it is not necessary to force the competition to be carried out in cases where the conditions are very different. However, do not overemphasize conditions, and do not emphasize the quality of the original conditions as the only factor, because conditions are created by people. Therefore, when carrying out same-condition competitions, units with slightly different conditions should not be excluded from participating in the competition; units with temporarily poor conditions should not sigh and retreat, but should actively create conditions and dare to participate in the competition.

Actively participating in same-crop competitions should be closely integrated with comprehensively strengthening the leadership of production. After a county participates in one or several crop competitions, it will inevitably strengthen the leadership of this or these crop production, which is undeniable; however, it must also be emphasized that the leadership of the production of all crops should be comprehensively strengthened. Originally, same-crop competitions were launched under the situation of a comprehensive leap forward. First, there was a comprehensive leap forward, and then there was talk of carrying out same-crop competitions; and one of the important purposes of comprehensively carrying out same-crop competitions for various crops is precisely to better realize the comprehensive leap forward.

The leap forward competition with the same conditions and the same crops can not only be carried out between counties, but also should and should be widely carried out between districts, townships, communities, and teams. It is hoped that leaders at all levels can quickly master this new leadership art and make positive contributions to the leap forward competition with the same conditions and the same crops, and work together to strive for a comprehensive and greater harvest and to realize the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program far ahead of schedule.

    农业生产竞赛的新阶段
    四川日报社论摘要
    泸县和江津之间，忠县和郫县之间开展同条件同作物的跃进竞赛，揭开了农业生产方面开展评比竞赛运动的新的一页。我们大力提倡这种新型的竞赛，愿更多的县都来参加这种竞赛，愿各地在各项农作物生产中都来开展这种同条件同作物的跃进竞赛。这对于促进全省农业高速度的增产将是大有裨益的。
    开展同条件同作物的跃进竞赛有很多好处。第一、同作物竞赛，目标更加具体、明确，更加便于互相学习，便于总结交流经验，便于检查评比，这是更具体、更好地贯彻执行检查评比这一领导方法的好办法。第二、以县为单位开展同作物竞赛，可以分别地创造出各种作物的大面积高产典型经验；认真总结推广这些经验，综合起来必然是有力地加强了对整个农业生产的领导。第三、分别开展各种作物的同作物竞赛，可以使高产作物变得更高产，也可以使所谓低产作物，通过竞赛，迅速变为高产作物，从而赢得各项作物的全面大丰收，全面大跃进。第四、同作物加上同条件，即双方都在生产条件基本相差不大的情况下展开竞赛，条件相当，门当户对，正好比高低，这就可以更好地调动竞赛双方的积极性，使人们更加积极地参加这种竞赛。正因为同条件同作物竞赛有着许多优越性，可以肯定，这一竞赛必然会迅速地、广泛地、深入持久地在全省开展起来。并且，各地还可以考虑把这种形式的竞赛逐步推广到积肥造肥、土制农药、改良工具、兴修水利、改造坡地、改良土壤、植树造林等等方面去，运用这一领导方法加强对各项工作的领导。
    当然，所谓“同条件”竞赛并不是提倡唯条件论。这里所说的“条件”，主要是指土壤、气候、水利条件的好坏以及作物的原有产量基础的高低，这些方面的条件的好坏，对于竞赛的结果会产生影响，所以，不必勉强地强调在互相间条件十分悬殊的情况下开展竞赛。但是，也不要过分强调条件，不要把原有条件的好坏强调成唯一的，因为条件是人创造的。所以说，在开展同条件竞赛的时候，也不要排斥互相间条件有所差别的单位参加竞赛；一时条件还较差的单位，更不要望洋兴叹，畏缩不前，应该积极地创造条件勇于参加竞赛。
    积极参加同作物竞赛要和全面加强对生产的领导紧密结合起来。一个县参加了一项或几项作物的竞赛之后，必然会特别加强对这一项或这几项作物生产的领导，这是无可非议的；但是，必须同时强调对各项作物的生产全面加强领导。本来，同作物竞赛就是在全面大跃进的形势下开展起来的，先有全面大跃进，后才谈得上开展同作物竞赛；并且，全面地开展各项作物的同作物竞赛，重要目的之一，也正是为了更好地实现全面大跃进。
    同条件同作物的跃进竞赛，不仅可以在各县之间进行，同样也可以而且也应该在区与区、乡与乡、社与社、队与队之间广泛开展起来，希望各级领导都能迅速掌握这一新的领导艺术，在同条件同作物的跃进竞赛中作出积极的贡献，共同为争取全面的更大丰收，为大大提前实现农业发展纲要四十条而努力。
