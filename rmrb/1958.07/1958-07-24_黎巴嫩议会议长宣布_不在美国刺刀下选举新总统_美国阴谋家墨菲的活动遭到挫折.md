Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 23rd: Newspapers here reported today that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Ousséran announced on the 22nd that the parliamentary session originally scheduled for July 24th to elect a new president has been postponed indefinitely.

    This indicates that the political machinations of veteran American conspirator and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy have suffered a setback. For the past few days, Murphy, acting as Eisenhower's "Special Political Representative," has been engaging in intense behind-the-scenes conspiracy activities in Beirut, purportedly to "mediate" between the Chamoun regime and the opposition. In coordination with the American military occupation of Lebanon, Murphy attempted to use political activities to force the opposition to accept the "election" of a new president favored by the United States through a meeting of the current parliament held on July 24th, in order to maintain its control over Lebanon.

    It is reported that many leaders and members of the opposition have stated that elections are meaningless until the American invading forces withdraw from Lebanon. They oppose holding elections under the shadow of American bayonets.

    According to the Lebanese constitution, the next president can be elected at any time within two months before the expiration of the current president's term on September 23rd. July 24th was the earliest possible date. Since the outbreak of a large-scale armed uprising in Lebanon against imperialism and its agents, the conspiracy to support the current imperialist agent, Chamoun, for re-election as president has completely failed due to widespread opposition. The imperialists have changed their plans and are attempting to use the current parliament, manipulated by the Chamoun clique, to "elect" a new president who will continue to serve the interests of imperialism.

    Meanwhile, the United States is intensifying its collusion with Chamoun, preparing to occupy Lebanon for a long time. According to Damascus' "Al-Ra'i Al-Aam" on the 23rd, Murphy told Maronite Bishop Saliba that "the United States will not withdraw from Lebanon soon. All indications are that your government (referring to the Chamoun regime) wants us to stay until there are international guarantees or an international armed force."

    Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: Beirut news: American invading forces sent fifty aircraft today to "demonstrate" over cities and towns throughout Lebanon, attempting to intimidate the Lebanese people.

    According to American news agencies, the American invading forces vainly hoped to use this "demonstration" to eliminate the impact of Lebanon's decision to postpone the presidential election and the inspiring speech delivered by President Nasser of the United Arab Republic on the 22nd.

### 黎巴嫩议会议长宣布  不在美国刺刀下选举新总统  美国阴谋家墨菲的活动遭到挫折

    黎巴嫩议会议长宣布
    不在美国刺刀下选举新总统
    美国阴谋家墨菲的活动遭到挫折
    新华社大马士革23日电　这里报纸今天报道，黎巴嫩议会议长奥塞兰在22日宣布，原定7月24日举行的选举新总统的议会会议无限期延期。
    这表明美国老牌阴谋家、副国务卿帮办墨菲的政治阴谋活动遭到了挫折。墨菲过去几天中一直以艾森豪威尔的“特别政治代表”身份，在贝鲁特进行着紧张的所谓在夏蒙政权和反对党之间“调停”的幕后阴谋活动。配合着美国武装占领黎巴嫩的军事行动，墨菲企图通过政治活动迫使反对党接受通过现议会在7月24日举行的会议“选举”出美国所属意的新总统，以便继续保持它对黎巴嫩的控制。
    据报道，反对党的许多领袖和议员都表示，在美国侵略军撤出黎巴嫩之前，选举没有意义。他们反对在美国刺刀阴影下举行选举。
    根据黎巴嫩宪法，可以在这一届总统在9月23日任期届满之前两个月内的任何时候选出下届总统，7月24日是最早的日期。自从黎巴嫩爆发反对帝国主义和它的代理人的大规模武装起义以来，由于帝国主义的现任代理人夏蒙受到普遍反对，想扶植他连任总统的阴谋彻底破产，帝国主义者就改变计划，企图利用由夏蒙集团操纵的现议会“选举”一个继续为帝国主义利益服务的新总统。
    同时，美国正在与夏蒙加紧勾结，准备长期侵占黎巴嫩。据大马士革“舆论报”23日报道，墨菲曾经告诉马龙派主教萨里巴说，“美国不会很快撤出黎巴嫩。一切迹象表明，你们的政府（指夏蒙政权）要求我们停留到有了国际保证或者国际武装部队为止”。
    据新华社23日讯　贝鲁特消息：美国侵略军今天派了五十架飞机在黎巴嫩各地城乡上空“示威”，妄图恫吓黎巴嫩人民。
    据美国的通讯社透露，美国侵略军妄想借这次“示威”来消除黎巴嫩决定推迟总统选举和阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在22日发表了鼓舞人心的演说这两件事的影响。
