(2) Then cut the soap into thin slices and grind the camphor pills into powder. Mix the two together, take half of the boiled alkali water, and dissolve it into a mixed liquid. (3) Then dissolve the other half of the boiled alkali water into cotton oil soap to make another mixed liquid. Finally, mix the above two together and stir with a wooden stick to form 3 jin of original liquid. Add 80-90 jin of water to the above original liquid, stir thoroughly, and then spray to control cotton aphids, with an effect of over 90%.

(X) Baibu Mixture: Use 5 jin of stinky paulownia, 5 jin of kudzu leaves, and 5 jin of red smartweed, add 45 jin of water, decoct twice, and extract the liquid.
