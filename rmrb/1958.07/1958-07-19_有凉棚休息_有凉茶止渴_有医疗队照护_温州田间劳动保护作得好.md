    Shaded Shelters for Rest, Cool Tea to Quench Thirst, Medical Teams for Care:
    Wen Zhou Does a Good Job in Field Labor Protection
    (Our Newspaper) According to reports, Lin Hujia, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, recently inspected agricultural production in the Wenzhou Special District and found that some places had not done a good job in field labor protection during the hot summer season, resulting in some farmers becoming ill or collapsing from exhaustion. Every time Lin Hujia arrived in a county, he would discuss with the local Party Committee how to improve labor protection, urging Party Committee leaders to pay attention to the health of commune members.
    Currently, most agricultural cooperatives in more than ten counties of this special district have established labor protection systems, stipulating more work in the early morning and evening, and a major rest during the hot noon, promoting a midday nap system. Many agricultural cooperatives have also established labor health protection systems for women. Shelters have been set up at the edges of fields, with cool tea and other cooling beverages provided to quench thirst and relieve the heat. Many townships and cooperatives also pay attention to minimizing meetings in the evening, and shortening the duration of necessary meetings as much as possible.
    During the busy season of harvesting and planting, commercial departments in various counties of the Wenzhou Special District also generally deliver goods to the countryside, supplying large quantities of pork, salted fish, local products and other non-staple foods, as well as towels and undershirts, so that commune members can appropriately increase their nutrition and purchase daily necessities.
    Medical and health departments in various counties are also going all out to do a good job in labor health care. Medical personnel in various places have put forward the slogan "Wherever the harvesting and planting rush goes, medical care goes there," organizing several thousand people to go to the countryside for mobile medical services. They provide treatment in the fields and regularly explain to the masses the common knowledge of preventing heatstroke and maintaining hygiene in diet and environment. (Yi Xintian)

    有凉棚休息　有凉茶止渴　有医疗队照护
    温州田间劳动保护作得好
    本报讯　中共浙江省委书记处书记林乎加最近到温州专区检查农业生产工作，发现有些地方在盛暑炎热季节里没有做好田间劳动保护工作，因而有一些农民害病、累倒。林乎加每到一县都和当地党委研究怎样做好劳动保护工作，要求党委领导重视社员们的健康。
    目前这个专区十多个县的农业社大多订出了劳动保护制度，规定早晚多劳动，中午炎热大休息，推行午睡制。许多农业社还订出了妇女劳动保健制度。田边都搭起了凉棚，放着凉茶和其它解渴止暑的清凉饮料。许多乡、社还注意晚上尽量少开会，必要的会也尽量缩短时间。
    在抢收抢种农忙期间，温州专区各县的商业部门也普遍送货下乡，大量供应猪肉、咸鱼、南货等副食品和毛巾、汗衫等，以便社员们适当增加营养和购买日用品。
    各县医疗卫生部门也全力以赴地做好劳动保健工作。各地医务人员提出了“抢收抢种到哪里，医疗就到哪里”的口号，组织了几千人下乡巡回医疗，他们一面田间治疗，一面经常向群众讲解防止中暑和饮食、环境清洁等卫生常识。　（伊心恬）
