    The Chinese government lodged a strong protest with the British government on July 19 against Britain's war provocation of invading Jordan and threatening the Republic of Iraq. The Chinese government warned the British government that it must immediately cease its aggressive acts and withdraw its invading troops from Jordan. The Chinese government also stated that peace-loving countries and people all over the world will never stand idly by in the face of imperialist aggression and war provocation.
    Prior to this, the Soviet government issued a statement on July 18 regarding the U.S. and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East, demanding that the U.S. and British governments immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan. The Soviet government also stated in its statement that the Soviet Union cannot turn a deaf ear to the acts of aggression occurring in areas adjacent to its borders, and that it will have to take necessary actions to ensure the security of the Soviet Union and maintain world peace.
    President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, also announced in a speech on the 18th that the Arab people would take up arms to defend the victories achieved by Iraq and to defend Arab nationalism.
    In recent days, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the people of other socialist countries, the people of Arab countries, and the people of Asian and African countries and other parts of the world have held powerful demonstrations for days in a row, protesting the aggressive acts of U.S. and British imperialism and expressing their full support for the people of Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan.
    Obviously, the countries and people of the world who truly love peace and freedom have begun to take action. This action is to stop the aggression and war provocation of U.S. and British imperialism, to defend the sacred right of national independence of all countries, and to defend peace in the Middle East and the world!
    The joint aggression of U.S. and British imperialism against Middle Eastern countries has seriously threatened peace in the Middle East and the world. After successively sending troops to occupy Lebanon and Jordan, U.S. and British imperialism are continuing to increase their troops in these two countries. Their aggressive armed forces are also hurriedly gathering in Turkey, Cyprus, Aden, and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The aggressive goals of the U.S. and Britain are pointing towards Iraq and the United Arab Republic. They vainly attempt to gain a foothold in Lebanon and Jordan, and then further extinguish the national independence movements throughout the Arab East and the Asian and African regions. This aggressive action and arrogant ambition of U.S. and British imperialism is a provocation to all countries and people who love peace and independence.
    Peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people all over the world must not stand idly by in the face of the war provocation of U.S. and British imperialism. History has repeatedly shown people that aggressors must be resolutely attacked; peace and national independence can only be achieved through resolute struggle against imperialist aggressors. Imperialism looks fierce and domineering, but in essence, it is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. As long as the people of all countries take action, imperialist aggression can be completely defeated, and imperialist war conspiracies can be completely stopped. Appeasement cannot achieve completeness, and indulgence only breeds evil. The development history of Hitler's Germany and the Japanese war of aggression is still fresh in the memory of the world and serves as a warning. Therefore, if the U.S. and British aggressors insist on refusing to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan and insist on expanding their aggression, then the only way out for the people of the world is to give the aggressors a head-on blow!
    The era in which imperialism wants to maintain colonial rule by means of military threats has long passed. During the Chinese People's Liberation War, the United States also sent a lot of troops to carry out military threats, but in the face of the Chinese people's resolute struggle, the American army finally rolled out of mainland China with its tail between its legs, and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, which was fully supported by the United States, finally collapsed. Then, the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea, vainly attempting to annex Korea and burn the flames of war to China, but under the heavy blows of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the American aggressors finally had to roll back south of the 38th parallel, admit defeat, and accept the armistice. The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. and French imperialism also achieved a glorious victory. In Egypt's struggle to defend its sovereignty over the Suez Canal and in Syria's struggle to safeguard its national independence, the Arab people displayed their unity and determination to resist the aggressors. In addition, the support of peaceful forces all over the world, socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, for the Arab people also timely stopped the aggression. Recently, the Indonesian government and people's struggle to defend the unity of their motherland has once again proved that only by resolutely and unswervingly opposing the interference of imperialism and its running dogs can they be forced to withdraw their hands. Imperialists have always bullied the weak and feared the strong, and only recognize strength. Only by carrying out a resolute struggle can we teach these imperialist pirates, who are accustomed to aggression, intervention, and war adventures, and force them to accept peace.
    Now, the balance of power is unprecedentedly unfavorable to U.S. and British imperialism. Since the end of World War II, the imperialist colonial system has fallen into disintegration. Old colonial countries with a population of 700 million have achieved independence, and countries with a population of more than 600 million are striving for independence or striving for complete independence, or are capitalist countries with neutral tendencies. The strength of the socialist camp, which resolutely supports all national independence movements, is also stronger than ever before. Imperialism has lost its advantage not only in the political field but also in the military field. Imperialism's world rule can be broken through anytime and anywhere; the battle line is long, it is impossible to defend against everything, there are loopholes everywhere, and it is impossible to make up for everything. After embarking on the road of military adventure, the situation of U.S. and British imperialism has become even more isolated. During the Korean War, the U.S. imperialists were still able to use various means to steal the flag of the United Nations, but this time, the United States is in an unprecedentedly difficult situation even in the United Nations organization, which it has long manipulated. Many countries have formally announced their support for the national struggle of the Republic of Iraq and the Arab people, while more countries have formally expressed their opposition to the armed intervention of the U.S. and Britain in the Middle East, demanding that they withdraw their troops quickly. The aggressive behavior of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East has not only been met with angry condemnation from peace-loving countries and people all over the world, but has also been opposed by the people of their own countries, and even by many bourgeois public opinions in their own countries. If the U.S. and British imperialists turn a deaf ear to the protests of the people of the world and the warnings of China and the Soviet Union, and do not withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible, and do not give up their war provocations that threaten the entire Arab national independence movement and world peace, then they will not have any other fate except to accelerate their own demise.
    UAR President Nasser said it well: "We treat those who treat us with a peaceful attitude with a peaceful attitude, and we are hostile to those who are hostile to us. If they are willing to be peaceful, we agree; if they are hostile to us, we will fight to the last drop of blood. This is our path and our motto." This is the common attitude of all people who love peace and uphold justice. We demand peace, but we are never afraid of war. If the irrational imperialist aggressors insist on competing, then all people who are unwilling to be slaves must make the necessary preparations.

### 不能袖手旁观

    不能袖手旁观
    中国政府在7月19日，为英国侵略约旦和威胁伊拉克共和国的战争挑衅行为，向英国政府提出严重抗议。中国政府警告英国政府必须立即停止其侵略行为，并从约旦撤出其侵略军队。中国政府还表示，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民对帝国主义的侵略和战争挑衅行为，绝不会袖手旁观。
    在这之前，苏联政府于7月18日就美英帝国主义侵略中近东的事件发表声明，要求美英政府立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的侵略军队。苏联政府在声明中还表示，苏联不能对在其国境邻近地区发生的侵略行动置若罔闻，它将不得不为苏联的安全和维护世界和平而采取必要行动。
    阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在18日发表的演说中也宣布，阿拉伯人民将拿起武器来保卫伊拉克取得的胜利、保卫阿拉伯民族主义。
    这几天，中国人民、苏联人民、其他社会主义国家人民、阿拉伯国家的人民以及亚非国家和世界其他各处的人民，都连日举行强大的示威游行，抗议美英帝国主义的侵略行为，并表示全力支持伊拉克、黎巴嫩和约旦人民。
    显然，世界上真正爱好和平和自由的国家和人民已经开始行动起来了。这个行动是为了要制止美英帝国主义的侵略和战争挑衅，为了保卫各国人民神圣的民族独立的权利，为了保卫中东以及全世界的和平！
    美英帝国主义合伙侵略中东国家，已使中东和全世界的和平受到了严重的威胁。美英帝国主义在先后派兵侵占了黎巴嫩和约旦之后，正继续向这两个国家增兵。它们的侵略武装并正匆忙地向土耳其、塞浦路斯、亚丁以及东地中海的海面集结。美英的侵略目标正在指向伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国。它们妄想在黎巴嫩和约旦站稳脚跟之后，来进一步扑灭整个阿拉伯东方和亚非地区的民族独立运动。美英帝国主义的这种侵略行动和狂妄野心，是对所有爱好和平和独立的国家和人民的挑衅。
    全世界爱好和平和自由的国家和人民，对于美英帝国主义的战争挑衅绝对不能袖手旁观。历史已一再昭示人们，对于侵略者必须予以坚决打击；和平和民族独立只有通过对帝国主义侵略者的坚决斗争才能取得。帝国主义看去张牙舞爪，不可一世，但实质上不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。只要各国人民行动起来，帝国主义的侵略完全可以打败，帝国主义的战争阴谋完全可以制止。委曲不能求全，姑息徒然养奸。希特勒德国和日本侵略战争的发展史，在全世界记忆犹新，足为殷鉴。因此，如果美英侵略者坚持不肯撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，坚持扩张侵略，那么全世界人民的唯一出路，就只有给侵略者一个迎头痛击！
    帝国主义想用武力威胁的方法来维持殖民统治的时代早已过去了。在中国人民解放战争中，美国也曾经派来不少军队进行武力威胁，但是在坚决斗争的中国人民面前，美国军队终于夹着尾巴滚出了中国大陆，而为美国所全力支持的蒋介石反动统治，也终于土崩瓦解。接着美国又发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，妄想侵吞朝鲜并把战火烧到中国，但是在朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的沉重打击下，美国侵略者也终于不得不滚回三八线以南，承认失败，接受停战。越南人民反对美法帝国主义的斗争，随后也取得了光荣的胜利。在埃及保卫苏伊士运河主权的斗争中，在叙利亚维护民族独立的斗争中，阿拉伯人民显示了团结一致、坚决抗击侵略者的意志，加上全世界和平力量、社会主义国家特别是苏联对阿拉伯人民的支持，也及时地制止了侵略。最近印度尼西亚政府和人民保卫祖国统一的斗争，又一次证明了只有坚决地毫不动摇地反对帝国主义及其走狗们的干涉，才能使他们缩回手去。帝国主义者从来就是欺软怕硬，只承认力量的。只有进行坚决的斗争，才能教训这些惯于进行侵略、干涉和战争冒险的帝国主义海盗，迫使他们接受和平。
    现在，力量的对比对于美英帝国主义是空前不利的。第二次世界大战结束以来，帝国主义的殖民体系已经陷于瓦解，拥有七亿人口的旧殖民地国家已取得了独立，还有六亿多人口的国家正在争取独立或争取完全独立，或者是带有中立倾向的资本主义国家，而坚决支持一切民族独立运动的社会主义阵营的力量也比过去任何时候更加强大。帝国主义不但在政治方面，而且在军事方面，都已经失去优势。帝国主义的世界统治随时随地都可以被突破；战线漫长，防不胜防，漏洞百出，补不胜补。美英帝国主义在踏上了军事冒险的道路之后，它们的处境就更加陷于孤立。在朝鲜战争中，美帝国主义者还能利用各种手段，盗用联合国的旗帜，而在这一次，美国甚至在它曾经长期操纵的联合国组织中，处境也空前困难。许多国家已经正式宣布支持伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯人民的民族斗争，而更多的国家已经正式表示反对美英在中东的武装干涉，要求它们迅速撤兵。美英帝国主义侵略中东的行为不仅遭到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的愤怒谴责，而且遭到了本国人民的反对，甚至遭到本国许多资产阶级舆论的反对。美英帝国主义者如果对全世界人民的抗议和中国、苏联的警告置若罔闻，不及早从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退他们的军队，不放弃威胁整个阿拉伯民族独立运动和世界和平的战争挑衅行为，那末，他们除了加速自己的灭亡以外，决不会有其他的命运。
    阿联总统纳赛尔说得好：“我们对那些以和平态度对待我们的人采取和平态度，我们敌视那些敌视我们的人。如果他们愿意和平，我们赞成，如果他们敌视我们，我们将战斗到最后一滴血。这就是我们的道路和我们的格言。”这是一切爱好和平、维护正义的人们的共同态度。我们要求和平，但是我们绝不害怕战争。丧失了理智的帝国主义侵略者，如果硬要较量一下，那末，一切不愿作奴隶的人们就必须作好必要的准备。
