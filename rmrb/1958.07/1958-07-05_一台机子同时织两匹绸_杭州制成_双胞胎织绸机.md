Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 4th: A silk weaving machine capable of simultaneously weaving two bolts of silk has been created at the Victory Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. This machine was modified from an existing silk weaving machine, and the workers call it the "Twin Silk Weaving Machine." The Hangzhou Municipal Textile Industry Bureau held an on-site meeting at the factory and immediately made an assessment, concluding that the quality of the products woven by this silk weaving machine fully meets the standards. This method can be promoted on both plain looms without patterns and jacquard looms with simple patterns. If all the modifiable silk weaving machines in Hangzhou's silk factories are modified, the city can increase silk production by more than 199,000 bolts in the second half of this year.

    一台机子同时织两匹绸
    杭州制成“双胞胎织绸机”
    据新华社杭州4日电　同时织出两匹绸缎的织绸机，已在浙江杭州市胜利丝织厂诞生。这是用原有的织绸机加以改装的，职工们叫它为“双胞胎织绸机”。杭州市纺织工业局在这个厂召开了现场会议，当场作出鉴定，认为这台织绸机织出来的产品质量完全合乎标准，这种方法不论在没有花纹的素机上和有简单花纹的花机上都可以推广。如果杭州市各丝绸厂可以改装的织绸机都加以改装，今年下半年就可增产绸缎十九万九千多匹。
