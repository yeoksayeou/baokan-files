The people of Shazhouba, Ruijin, have always told the story of Chairman Mao naming Yang Damao.

It was an evening in the early summer of 1934. After dinner, Chairman Mao took his child, Xiao Mao, for a walk near the doorway and came to the camphor tree with its towering ancient trunk. At this moment, Yang Damao's mother happened to be resting with her child on a stone slab under the tree. Chairman Mao saw that this child was smart, clever, and lovable, and he stroked his head affectionately. Chairman Mao asked with a smile:

"What's his name?"
"Fasheng [meaning "happening"]"
"How old is he?"
"Two years old."

Chairman Mao heard that he was the same age as Xiao Mao, so he brought Xiao Mao over to stand next to Fasheng for comparison. Fasheng was a little taller than Xiao Mao. Chairman Mao said kindly to the young mother:

"Let him be called Damao [meaning "big Mao"]."

From then on, the name Yang Damao spread in Shazhouba.

Soon after, the Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese. The Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a mad slaughter of the people of Shazhouba, and people no longer dared to openly mention Chairman Mao naming Yang Damao. But the people of Shazhouba firmly believed that Chairman Mao would definitely return, and they often secretly talked about it. Damao's mother was also a strong Soviet-era woman. Although her husband had gloriously sacrificed during the Long March with Chairman Mao, she was not saddened, and she placed all her hopes on her child. One late night, Damao was sleeping so sweetly, but his mother's heart could not calm down. She recalled Chairman Mao's tall figure and kind smile, calling out the name "Damao" under the camphor tree. The more she thought about it, the more excited and moved she became. She suddenly woke Damao up and said:

"Damao, when Chairman Mao lived next door to us, he liked you very much. Your name was given by Chairman Mao. When you grow up, you must follow Chairman Mao and become a Red Army soldier to fight the White bandits, just like your father...."

After hearing his mother's words, Damao was very grateful to Chairman Mao and was determined to avenge his father. He and the children in the village, regardless of the beatings and scoldings from the White bandits and local bullies, secretly sang the songs of the Red Army and the people of Shazhouba, remembering Chairman Mao:

　　The white pagoda stands tall and erect,
　　The Mian River flows eastward forever,
　　Red sons and daughters, advancing wave upon wave,
　　Regardless of the bloody storms,
　　The people of the Red Zone will forever remember Mao Zedong.

Once, a landlord heard it and cursed: "Little devils, you are not allowed to sing." Yang Damao retorted: "We will sing!" The landlord got angry: "See if you little fellows can be red for a lifetime?" Yang Damao resolutely resisted, saying, "See if you can be white for a lifetime." The landlords beat him, Yang Damao ran away, and the landlords could do nothing...

In August 1949, Ruijin was liberated, and the red flag flew again over Shazhouba. Yang Damao and everyone else overthrew the landlords and bullies who rode on the backs of the people, and the people began to live a happy life again. Soon after, Chairman Mao sent a central delegation to visit the old revolutionary base areas in the south to express condolences to Shazhouba, Ruijin. After conveying Chairman Mao's concern for the people of Shazhouba, the delegation said: "Chairman Mao misses the people of Shazhouba who worked, lived, and fought with him. To this day, he still remembers the names of Yang Damao and Yang Yanhong clearly..." When these words reached the ears of Yang Damao and his mother, the mother happily said to Damao: "Chairman Mao still remembers your name. How concerned he is about the children of the Soviet area! You must maintain this glorious title..."

When the Party called for large-scale afforestation, the people of Shazhouba remembered what Chairman Mao had told them about planting trees and decided to turn Shazhouba into a green ocean. The youth shock brigade led by Yang Damao had greater enthusiasm than anyone else in the afforestation campaign. Because they lacked experience, the survival rate was only 50%. Everyone was a little discouraged. At this time, Yang Damao thought of the story of Chairman Mao giving him his name and the heroic sacrifice of his father. An endless stream of power came from the bottom of his heart. He immediately sought advice from elderly farmers and carefully studied the reasons for the failure—it was due to the shortcomings of only caring about quantity and not quality. So he said to everyone: "When Chairman Mao was in Shazhouba, it was shady with green trees. When the Kuomintang came, they turned the green mountains into bare mountains. We must restore the lush and beautiful appearance of the mountains and rivers of the Soviet era." The old comrades also agreed with his words. Under his influence, the young men and women of the whole village actively participated in the high tide of afforestation and water conservancy construction. After several years of efforts, they afforested more than 7,000 mu of land and realized the greening of the township ahead of schedule. They also built a large reservoir and more than 100 wells, so that the originally bare hills became lush fields, and the originally water-scarce land was irrigated all year round, guaranteeing a bumper harvest in agriculture.

Now, Yang Damao is already a member of the Shazhouba Party general branch of the Communist Party of China and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and also serves as a member of the county people's committee. Shazhouba has become a no-illiteracy township and achieved vehicle ownership before "July 1st".

    毛主席起的名字
    裘之倬
    瑞金沙洲坝的人民一直传说着毛主席给杨大毛起名字的故事。
    那是1934年初夏的一个傍晚。毛主席吃过晚饭，带着他的小孩小毛到门口散步，来到古木参天的樟树底下，这时杨大毛的妈妈，恰好也带着孩子坐在树底下石板上休息，毛主席看到这小孩长得聪明伶俐惹人爱，用手爱抚地摸着他的头。毛主席微笑地问：
    “叫什么名字呀？”
    “发生”
    “几岁呀？”
    “两岁。”
    毛主席听说和小毛同岁，就把小毛领过来，和发生站在一块比了一比，发生比小毛高一点。毛主席和蔼地对这位年轻的妈妈说：
    “让他叫大毛吧。”
    从此，杨大毛的名字在沙洲坝叫开了。
    不久，红军北上抗日，国民党反动派对沙洲坝人民进行了疯狂的屠杀，人们再也不敢公开提起毛主席给杨大毛起名字的事情。但是沙洲坝的人民坚信毛主席一定会回来的，他们经常秘密地传说着。大毛的妈妈也是一位坚强的苏区妇女，虽然自己的丈夫跟毛主席长征光荣的牺牲了，可是并不悲伤，她把希望完全寄托在孩子身上。在一个深夜里，大毛睡得是那样的香甜，妈妈的心怎么也平静不下来，她回忆起毛主席高大的身影，和蔼的笑容，在樟树底下叫着“大毛”的名字，想到这里越想越兴奋，越想越激动，她一下把大毛推醒。说：
    “大毛仔呀！从前毛主席住在我们隔壁的时候，他很欢喜你，你的名字就是毛主席起的，你长大了要跟毛主席走，和爸爸一样当红军打白狗子……。”
    大毛听了妈妈的话，心里很感谢毛主席，决心要为爸爸报仇，他和村里的儿童不顾白狗子、地主恶霸的打骂，偷偷地唱着红军和沙洲坝人民怀念毛主席的歌曲：
      白塔巍峨矗立，
      绵江长流向东，
      红色儿女，前仆后继，
      任凭血雨腥风，
      红区人民永远怀念毛泽东。
    有一次，地主听到了破口大骂：“小鬼，不准唱。”杨大毛就顶着：“就要唱。”地主火了：“看你们这些小家伙红得一世？”杨大毛坚决反抗说：“看你们白也白得一世”，地主们打，杨大毛就跑，地主们也没办法……。
    1949年8月，瑞金解放了，沙洲坝上空又飘起了红旗，沙洲坝的人民重见了太阳。杨大毛和大家一起斗倒了骑在人民头上的地主恶霸，人民又开始过着幸福的生活。不久，毛主席派来了中央南方老根据地访问团来瑞金沙洲坝慰问。访问团在传达了毛主席对沙洲坝人民的关怀后说：“毛主席很想念和他在一起工作、生活、战斗过的沙洲坝人民，至今，对杨大毛、杨衍宏的名字还记得清清楚楚……。”这句话传到杨大毛和他妈妈的耳里，这位妈妈幸福的对大毛说：“毛主席还记得你的名字，他是多么关心苏区儿童啊！你一定要保持这个光荣称号……。”
    在党号召大规模造林时，沙洲坝人民记起了毛主席以前叫他们种树的话，决定要把沙洲坝变成一个绿色的海洋。杨大毛领导的青年突击队在造林运动中，比什么人的干劲都大。由于他们缺乏经验，成活率只有50％。大家有些信心不高。就在这个时候，杨大毛想起了毛主席给他起名的故事，想起了父亲的英勇牺牲，一股无穷无尽的力量从心底里产生出来了，他立刻找老年农民请教，仔细研究失败的原因——是由于只顾数量不顾质量的缺点，于是对大伙说：“毛主席在沙洲坝的时候，绿树成荫，国民党来了，把青山变成了光山，我们要恢复苏区时代山青水秀的面貌。”老同志也赞成他的话，在他的影响下，全乡男女青年又积极投入了造林和兴修水利高潮，经过几年的努力，绿化了七千多亩面积，提前实现了绿化乡，还兴修了一个大型水库，一百多口水井，使原来光秃秃的山岗变成了绿油油的垅野，原来缺水的土地，一年四季得到灌溉了，保证了农业大丰收。
    现在，杨大毛已经是中共沙洲坝党总支委员兼团总支书记了，同时还担任了县人民委员会的委员。沙洲坝已成了无盲乡，在“七一”前夕又实现车子化了。
