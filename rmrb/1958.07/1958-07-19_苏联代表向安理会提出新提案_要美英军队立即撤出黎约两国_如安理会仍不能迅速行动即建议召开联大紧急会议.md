Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 18th: At the United Nations Security Council meeting held on the 17th, Soviet Representative Sobolev demanded that the United States and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, or he would suggest convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Sobolev revised and supplemented the Soviet proposal submitted on the 15th, which demanded the withdrawal of US troops from Lebanon, by adding condemnation of the British armed intervention in Jordan and a call for the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan.

The full text of the new proposal is as follows:

“The Security Council,

Having heard the report of the United States representative on the entry of United States armed forces into Lebanon and the report of the United Kingdom representative on the entry of United Kingdom armed forces into Jordan,

Considering that such actions are a gross interference in the internal affairs of the Arab peoples, as such actions violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in particular Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter, which prohibits intervention in matters which are essentially within the jurisdiction of any state.

Considering that the actions of the United States and the United Kingdom seriously threaten international peace and security,

Hereby calls upon the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to cease armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Arab countries and to immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.”

Sobolev said that if the Security Council is powerless to do anything about this and cannot pass this draft resolution today, then the Soviet delegation will suggest convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue of armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and the United Kingdom.

The meeting on the 17th continued to discuss the situation in Lebanon. Also on the agenda was Jordan's so-called "accusation" against the United Arab Republic. Soviet Representative Sobolev said that Jordan's accusation did not cite any facts to prove that the accusation was justified. However, the Soviet delegation does not object to including this item on the agenda, because doing so would make it possible to discuss the truly important issue of British armed intervention in Jordan.

When speaking, the United Arab Republic representative, Lutfi, emphasized that the sole purpose of Jordan’s accusation of the so-called "interference" by the United Arab Republic in Jordan is to find a pretext in advance for the re-invasion of Jordan by British troops.

When talking about the situation in Lebanon, Lutfi pointed out that the excuse of so-called “protecting American expatriates” by US Representative Lodge is the excuse that colonialists have always used in the last century to carry out endless colonial wars. He said that, moreover, no Americans have been harmed in the internal crisis in Lebanon over the past sixty days.

Lutfi said that the real purpose of the aggression by the United States and the United Kingdom is to interfere in the events in Iraq, and the events in Iraq are purely the internal affairs of the Iraqi people.

    苏联代表向安理会提出新提案
    要美英军队立即撤出黎约两国
    如安理会仍不能迅速行动即建议召开联大紧急会议
    据新华社18日讯　纽约消息：在联合国安全理事会17日举行的会议上，苏联代表索波列夫要求美国和英国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，否则即将建议召开联合国大会紧急会议。
    索波列夫就苏联15日提出的要求美军撤出黎巴嫩的提案作了修正和补充，增加了对于英国武装干涉约旦的谴责和要求英国军队撤出约旦的呼吁。
    这项新提案全文如下：
    “安全理事会，　
    听取了美国代表关于美国武装部队进入黎巴嫩的报告以及英国代表关于英国武装部队进入约旦的报告，
    认为这种行动是对阿拉伯各国人民内政的粗暴干涉，因为这种行动违背联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，特别是违反宪章第二条第七款，即禁止干涉实际上属于任何一个国家管辖范围内的事务的条款。
    考虑到，美国和英国的行为严重地威胁着国际和平和安全，
    特呼吁美国和英国两国政府停止对阿拉伯国家的内政进行武装干涉并且立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出自己的军队。”
    索波列夫说，如果安理会对此无能为力，今天不能通过这项决议草案，那末，苏联代表团就要建议召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论关于美国和英国对黎巴嫩和约旦发动武装侵略的问题。
    17日的会议继续讨论了黎巴嫩的局势。列在会议议程上的还有约旦对阿拉伯联合共和国的所谓“控诉案”，苏联代表索波列夫说，约旦的控诉案中并没有引证任何事实来证明这个控诉案是有根据的。但是，苏联代表团并不反对把这一项列入议程，因为这样作就有可能讨论英国武装干涉约旦这个真正重要的问题。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲发言时强调指出，约旦关于所谓阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”约旦的控诉的唯一用意就是事先为英国军队重新侵略约旦寻找口实。
    卢特菲在谈到黎巴嫩的局势时指出，美国代表洛奇所谓必须“保护美国侨民”的借口是上一世纪殖民者为进行无休止的殖民战争所一直使用的借口。他说，而且，在黎巴嫩六十天来的内部危机中，并没有一个美国人受到伤害。
    卢特菲说，美国和英国进行侵略的真正目的是要干涉伊拉克事件，而伊拉克事件纯属伊拉克人民的内务。
