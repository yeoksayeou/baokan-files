Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Wang Fuying, a young radio operator at the Changli County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province and a retired soldier, recently successfully created a simple conference telephone suitable for rural use. Relevant departments believe that this is a good way to quickly establish a telephone conference network in China's vast rural areas under the current conditions.

This simple conference telephone has a simple structure and is easy to manufacture. Its shape is like a radio, and it is made of electrical materials such as two small vacuum tubes, a small transformer, and a speaker. It uses the original county and township telephone as a transmitter and dry batteries as a power source, and can be equipped with two or three hundred small loudspeakers. These small loudspeakers can not only receive the other party's voice, but also be used to speak to the other party. This simple conference telephone can also be used in place of an ordinary telephone.

Wang Fuying is a 26-year-old retired soldier who did not even finish high school. During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production last winter, Wang Fuying repaired power lines in the countryside and deeply experienced that the Party's calls and instructions could not be transmitted in a timely manner due to the lack of telecommunications equipment in rural areas. Therefore, he decided to create a simple conference telephone that would be inexpensive and effective. He worked tirelessly and explored for more than a month before successfully creating it.

    复员军人王副英创制简易会议电话机
    据新华社讯　河北省昌黎县邮电局青年机务员王副英最近创造成功一种适合农村用的简易会议电话机，有关部门认为：在目前条件下，为我国广大农村迅速建立电话会议网找到了一个好办法。
    这种简易会议电话机构造简单，制造容易。它的外形好像一部收音机，是由两个小真空管、一个小变压器和一个扬声器等电器材料做成的。它利用原有县乡的电话机作为发电筒，干电池作为电源，能带上两三百小喇叭。这种小喇叭不仅可以收听对方讲话声音，而且可以利用它向对方讲话。这种简易会议电话机还可以代替普通电话机使用。
    王副英是个复员军人，二十六岁，高中都没念完。去冬农业生产大跃进中，王副英在乡下检修电线，深深体验到农村由于没有电讯设备，党的号召和指示不能及时传达下来。于是他决心创造一种花钱少能办事的简易会议电话机。他废寝忘食地苦苦钻研和摸索了一个多月，才把它创造成功。
