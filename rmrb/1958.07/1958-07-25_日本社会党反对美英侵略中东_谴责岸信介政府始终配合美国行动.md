Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 23rd. The Japanese Socialist Party today issued a statement demanding that the United States and the United Kingdom stop armed intervention in Middle Eastern countries and that the invading troops of the United States and the United Kingdom withdraw from Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya. The statement said that in order to eliminate the tense situation in the Middle East and realize the above requirements, the Japanese Socialist Party demanded that an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly be convened. The statement also called for a summit conference of the governments of relevant countries to achieve peace.

In the statement, the Japanese Socialist Party believed that the reason why the proposal put forward by the Kishi Nobusuke government's representative in the United Nations Security Council was rejected was because the Kishi Nobusuke government had been cooperating with the United States' actions from beginning to end, "to the point that member states suspected that Japan believed that American troops could remain in Lebanon."

At a meeting held on the 21st, the Socialist Party International Bureau also decided to write to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the name of the Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party. The letter stated that the Socialist Party believes that the problems of the Middle Eastern countries are internal affairs, and the armed intervention by the United States and Britain is illegal and disregards the United Nations. The letter pointed out that the crisis in the Middle East is caused by actions to protect colonial interests and strengthen military power. The letter demanded that the US-British invading forces immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan.

Speaking at a press conference held in Sapporo on the 22nd, Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki, when talking about the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-power summit conference to stop the military conflict that has begun in the Middle East, said that it is the responsibility of the major powers to resolve it peacefully among themselves. He advocated that "the major powers should, on the one hand, make efforts in the United Nations, and on the other hand, hold a summit conference to discuss ways to deal with the situation."

When talking about the current situation in the Middle East, Mosaburo Suzuki said that if a war breaks out at this time, it will turn into a nuclear war. He pointed out that at present, world public opinion is severely condemning the United States and the United Kingdom for their aggressive actions against Middle Eastern countries. He said: "The attitude of the United States and the United Kingdom in taking such actions under the watchful eyes of the people of the world is unacceptable."

    日本社会党反对美英侵略中东
    谴责岸信介政府始终配合美国行动
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，要求制止美英两国对中东国家进行武装干涉，并且使美英两国的侵略军队从黎巴嫩、约旦和利比亚撤出。声明说，为了消除中东局势的紧张状态和实现上述要求，日本社会党要求召开联合国大会紧急会议。声明并且要求召开有关国家的政府首脑会议，以实现和平。
    日本社会党在声明中认为，岸信介政府的代表在联合国安全理事会上提出的提案所以遭到否决，是由于岸信介政府自始至终都在配合着美国的行动，“以至使会员国怀疑日本认为美国军队可以留在黎巴嫩”。
    社会党国际局在21日召开的会议上，还决定以日本社会党委员长的名义写信给美、英、苏三国首脑。信中说，社会党认为，中东国家的问题是内政问题，美英进行武装干涉是非法的，是无视联合国的行动。信中指出，中东的危机是由于保护殖民主义的利益和加强军事力量的行动而引起的。信中要求美英侵略军立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出。
    社会党委员长铃木茂三郎22日在札幌举行的记者招待会上谈到苏联提出的关于召开五国首脑会议来制止中近东已经开始的军事冲突的建议时说，大国有责任在大国之间和平地加以解决。他主张，“大国应该一方面在联合国中进行努力，另一方面举行首脑会议来讨论收拾局面的办法。”
    铃木茂三郎在谈到目前中近东的局势时说，目前如果爆发战争，就会变成一场核武器战争。他指出，目前，世界舆论正在严厉谴责美国和英国对中东国家的侵略行动。他说：“在全世界人民众目睽睽之下采取这种行动的美英的态度是不能容许的”。
