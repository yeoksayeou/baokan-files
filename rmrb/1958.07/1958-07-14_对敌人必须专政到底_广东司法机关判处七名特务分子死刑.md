Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. On July 5th, Guangdong Province judicial organs convened sentencing rallies in Bao'an, Xinyi, Lianping and Guangzhou, respectively, sentencing special agent elements Xiao Deqiang, Chen Cheng, Cai Shiping, Qiu Guandai, Li Zhixiong, Gao Bingbang, and Liao Wen to death in accordance with the law, with immediate execution. At the same time, the Guangdong People's Procuratorate, based on the policy of "leniency for confession, atonement for crimes, and rewards for major meritorious service," announced the exemption from prosecution for special agents Kuang Min and Li Rong, who surrendered themselves, and Yao Tiansheng, who atoned for their crimes with meritorious service.

It has been confirmed by public security organs' investigations that these special agent elements were sent by Chiang gang special agent organs to sneak into various parts of Guangdong to conspire to create disturbances and carry out evil activities such as explosions and arson.

The special agent element Xiao Deqiang joined a special agent organization in Hong Kong in August 1957 and accepted the task of blowing up the Guangjiu Railway bridge. Later, due to changes in the situation, this conspiracy failed. Not long after, she was appointed by the special agent organization as the captain of the "Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian Action Team," and in April of this year, she sneaked into Bao'an and Huiyang counties carrying weapons to carry out sabotage activities.

The special agent elements Chen Cheng and Cai Shiping were sent by the Hong Kong Chiang gang special agent organs to Guangzhou on May 14 of this year to collect intelligence on the location, guards, entry and exit system, work and rest hours, and whereabouts of leaders of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and other government agencies. They planned to report this information to the special agent organs in Hong Kong after collecting it, and then the special agent organs would send a group of armed special agents to sneak in to attack our government agencies. However, shortly after Chen and Cai sneaked into Guangzhou, they were reported by the masses. After Chen and Cai were arrested, in addition to confessing the above crimes, they also confessed that they were smuggled in by Qiu Guandai, a special agent in Sheung Shui, Kowloon, and Yao Tiansheng, a farmer in Luofang Village, Bao'an County. When the public security organs summoned Yao Tiansheng based on this clue, Yao confessed all his crimes and expressed his willingness to atone for his crimes with meritorious service. He assisted the public security organs in capturing Qiu.

The other three special agent elements sentenced to death, Li Zhixiong, Gao Bingbang, and Liao Wen, were sent by the special agent organs to establish so-called "guerrilla armed forces" and instigate riots. After these special agent elements sneaked into Fengchuan, Xinyi, Guangzhou, and Lianping and other places, they actively wooed some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and released criminals from labor camps to participate in special agent organizations, and conspired to create armed riots.

The special agent element Kuang Min, who received lenient treatment, was originally a ship driver. In 1956, he was introduced by special agent Chen Huifang to join a special agent organization. At about 2:00 a.m. on the night of October 11 last year, special agent Chen Huifang gave Kuang Min a time bomb and asked him to take it to Jiangmen to wait for another special agent to take it away for sabotage activities against us. After Kuang Min arrived in Jiangmen, he waited at the agreed location for four consecutive days without seeing that special agent. After some ideological struggle, he finally surrendered himself to our public security organs.

Another special agent element, Li Rong, who received lenient treatment, accepted a package of explosives and two detonators from a special agent organization in Hong Kong in May of this year and brought them back to Jiangmen City, plotting to blow up the Beitie Sugar Factory or the Cultural Palace. After Li Rong sneaked into Jiangmen, just as the masses were carrying out a security campaign, he became frightened and chose the path of surrendering himself to the public security organs.

    对敌人必须专政到底
    广东司法机关判处七名特务分子死刑
    新华社广州电　广东省司法机关5日分别在宝安、信宜、连平等县和广州市召开宣判大会，依法判处特务分子萧德强、陈成、蔡世平、丘官带、黎志雄、高秉邦、廖文等七人死刑，立即执行。同时，广东人民检察院根据“坦白从宽、立功折罪、立大功受奖”的政策，分别宣布对投案自首的特务分子邝民、李荣和立功赎罪的姚天生免于起诉。
    经公安机关侦讯证实，这批特务分子是由蒋帮特务机关派遣潜入广东各地阴谋制造骚乱和进行爆炸、纵火等罪恶活动的。
    特务分子萧德强1957年8月在香港参加特务组织后，就接受炸毁我广九铁路桥梁的任务，后来因为情况变化，这一阴谋未能得逞。不久，她又被特务机关委任为“反共抗俄行动队”中队长，在今年4月间携带武器潜入宝安、惠阳县境进行破坏活动。
    特务分子陈成、蔡世平在今年5月14日由香港蒋帮特务机关派来广州，搜集我广东省人民委员会和其他政府机关的驻地、警卫、出入制度、作息时间、首长行踪等情报。他们准备在搜集到这些情报后，回香港向特务机关报告，再由特务机关派遣一批武装特务潜来袭击我政府机关。但陈、蔡二犯潜入广州市不久，就被群众检举了。陈、蔡二犯被捕后，除供认了上述罪行以外，还供出他们偷渡是由九龙上水特务分子丘官带和宝安县罗坊村农民姚天生带进来的。公安机关根据这个线索传讯姚天生时，姚犯全部坦白了自己的罪行，并表示愿意立功赎罪。他协助公安机关捕获了丘犯。
    被判处死刑的另外三名特务分子黎志雄、高秉邦、廖文，是被特务机关派来建立所谓“游击武装”和策动暴乱的。这些特务分子先后潜入封川、信宜、广州和连平等地后，积极拉拢一些地主、富农、反革命分子和劳改释放犯等参加特务组织，阴谋制造武装暴乱。
    受到宽大处理的特务分子邝民，原是一个轮船司机，1956年由特务陈惠芳介绍参加特务组织。去年10月11日深夜二时许，特务陈惠芳交给邝民一颗定时炸弹，要他带到江门，等候另外一个特务分子取去，对我进行破坏活动。邝民到达江门后，在约定地点一连等了四天，没有等到那个特务分子。经过一番思想斗争以后，他终于向我公安机关投案自首。
    受到宽大处理的另一名特务分子李荣，今年5月间在香港接受特务机关交给的一包炸药和两支雷管，带回江门市，阴谋爆炸北街糖厂或文化宫。李荣潜入江门以后，正当群众开展安全运动，他害怕起来，就选择了向公安机关投案自首的道路。
