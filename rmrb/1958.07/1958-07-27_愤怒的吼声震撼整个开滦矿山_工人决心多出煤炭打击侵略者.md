Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 26th: The workers of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan, who had been under the rule of British imperialism for many years and have a glorious history of anti-imperialist struggle, unanimously condemned the heinous crimes of the American and British imperialist bandits in invading the people of the Middle East.

In recent days, tens of thousands of miners have held rallies and parades day and night, writing protest letters and posting slogans. They shouted, "Americans and British get out of the Middle East!" "Resolutely support the struggle of the people of the Middle East!" The angry roars shook the entire mine. By the 25th, more than 40,000 miners in the entire mine had participated in demonstrations and various protest activities. Zhang Ziyou, who has worked for more than 20 years, said, "The American imperialists' excuse of 'protecting overseas Chinese' is complete nonsense! If the American imperialists do not get out of the Middle East, peace-loving people all over the world will surely bury them." Ning Qianyong, a miner who volunteered to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said, "The American imperialists, who were defeated by us on the Korean battlefield, are now invading the people of the Middle East again, and they will definitely be smashed to pieces again!" He warned the American and British imperialists that their days of rampant bullying are long gone, and if the American and British imperialists insist on acting recklessly, he will take up arms again and severely strike at the invaders who are undermining peace.

The enraged miners of the Kailuan Coal Mine are stepping up production and construction, producing more coal to strengthen the power of the motherland. Many groups and individuals have formulated and revised plans to improve efficiency and increase raw coal production. The floating coal workers of the 3991 team of the Majiagou Mine proposed that the raw coal output per shift be increased from 270 carts in the past to 320 carts, and now it has reached 338 carts.

    愤怒的吼声震撼整个开滦矿山
    工人决心多出煤炭打击侵略者
    新华社天津26日电　曾经多年在英帝国主义统治下，有着光荣的反帝斗争历史的唐山开滦煤矿工人，一致声讨美英帝国主义强盗侵略中东人民的万恶罪行。
    几天来，成千上万的矿工不分昼夜地举行集会、游行，写抗议书和张贴标语。他们高呼：“美国佬、英国佬滚出中东去！”“全力支持中东人民的斗争！”愤怒的吼声，震撼着整个矿山。到25日，全矿有四万多名矿工参加了游行示威和各种抗议活动。有着二十多年工龄的张自有说：“美帝国主义‘保护侨民’的借口完全是胡说八道！如果美帝国主义不滚出中东，全世界爱好和平的人民，一定把它埋葬掉。”曾经志愿参加过抗美援朝的矿工宁谦勇说：“在朝鲜战场上被我们打败了的美帝国主义，现在又在侵略中东人民，肯定要再一次碰得头破血流！”他警告美英帝国主义者，他们横行霸道的日子早已过去了，假如美英帝国主义硬要蛮干下去，他将重新拿起武器，狠狠地打击破坏和平的侵略者。
    被激怒了的开滦煤矿的矿工们，正在加紧生产和建设，多出煤炭，加强祖国的威力。许多小组和个人都纷纷制订和修改了提高效率、增加原煤产量的计划。马家沟矿三九九一掌的浮煤工人提出每班原煤产量由过去二百七十车增加到三百二十车后，现在已达到三百三十八车。
