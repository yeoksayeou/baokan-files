    Good Flowers Bloom More Fragrantly
    Good flowers bloom more fragrantly,
    The cooperative is becoming more and more prosperous;
    Production is getting better and better,
    Happiness is getting longer and longer.
              (Lanxi, Zhejiang)

    好花越开越香
    好花越开越香，
    合作社越来越兴旺；
    生产越搞越好，
    幸福越来越长。
              （浙江兰溪）
