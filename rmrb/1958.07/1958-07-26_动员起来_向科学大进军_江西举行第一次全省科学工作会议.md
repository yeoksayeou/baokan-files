Get Mobilized and Launch a Great March Towards Science
Jiangxi Holds First Provincial Science Conference

Lushan, July 25th (reported by reporter Li Lianbin): Jiangxi Province's First Provincial Science Conference was grandly held in Lushan from July 18th to 24th. A total of 1,046 people attended the conference. Among them were science and technology and cultural and educational workers, leading cadres from the provincial, special district, city, county, and township levels, working cadres from factories and mines and rural areas, and workers and farmers who have achieved outstanding results in science and technology. Responsible comrades from the State Council's Science Planning Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and relevant central departments participated in the meeting, and many provinces also sent representatives to exchange experiences. This conference was conducted under the direct leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee. During the conference, "native" experts and "foreign" experts gathered together to exchange experiences and learn from each other.

The central topic of this conference was to further break down superstitions, liberate thinking, overcome the mysterious view of science, and call on and mobilize the people of the province to launch a great march towards science. To set off a new upsurge of technological revolution and cultural revolution throughout the province.

Shao Shiping (Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor), Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Science Work Committee and President of the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a report to the conference on behalf of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee. The meeting also summarized the new achievements of past scientific work.

At present, science research institutions at all levels in Jiangxi Province are being established one after another. Most special districts, cities, and counties have established scientific research institutes. More than 100 animal and plant research gardens have been established in comprehensive reclamation farms throughout the province, and research organizations in factories and rural areas are developing like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In Yudu County, 421 agricultural cooperatives have established 518 agricultural science and technology research groups. Various research units have extensively carried out scientific research work. According to incomplete statistics, more than 10,000 scientific research projects are underway throughout the province, and some research projects have already achieved certain results. For example, the indigenous method of iron and steel smelting has been widely adopted throughout the province. The science and technology research groups of agricultural cooperatives in Lianhua County have successfully tested and promoted more than ten kinds of fertilizers such as artificial manure and phosphorus-potassium, and created more than 100 kinds of new agricultural tools. The province has created many technically complex new products, and the quality of many products has exceeded that of Britain. For example, the violet ketone content of the violet ketone successfully trial-produced by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Light Industry reached 98%, exceeding that of Britain (British content is 95.8%). A large army of science, technology, and culture is taking shape in Jiangxi Province. In Guixi County alone, more than 2,400 activists in scientific and technological innovation have emerged. Many activists have made outstanding contributions. He Laichang, known as the "youthful Michurin," has successfully cultivated a high-quality rice variety called "Zhouchang No. 1," which has strong stalks, large ears, and many grains. One ear has more than 300 grains, and its prolificacy is comparable to sorghum. Wu Binghe of Leping County, known as the "farmer philosopher," in order to solve practical problems in work and production, and to solve his own ideological understanding problems, read more than a dozen books on philosophy with an attitude of seeking a teacher, had a very deep understanding of the fundamental principles of dialectical materialism, and achieved significant results in applying dialectical materialism in practical work and production.

Recently, Jiangxi also put forward the requirements of "Ten Hundred Thousand" (ten systematic summaries of experience, one hundred Marxist-Leninist papers, one thousand theory instructors, and ten thousand instructors) and a series of mass measures such as "five-in-one" (combining work, study, research, writing, and lecturing).

In order to meet the needs of the new situation of the Great Leap Forward, the meeting decided to develop 700,000 scientific and technical researchers in the 25,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, and 300,000 in factories, mines, and schools. In order to facilitate command operations, the meeting required the universal establishment of scientific research institutions. Special districts and cities established district (city) branches, counties established scientific research institutes, townships established scientific research stations, and cooperatives and factories and mines established research groups. It was also required that various research organizations, in combination with current needs and long-term needs, formulate scientific research plans. In order to achieve the above requirements and achieve the goal of the whole people marching towards science, the meeting emphasized putting politics in command. Leading cadres at all levels consciously and automatically put the leadership responsibility for scientific research work on their shoulders. At the same time, it is necessary to scientifically summarize the creations and inventions of workers and peasants in the Great Leap Forward. Through the method of summary, the "five-in-one" will be promoted to the vast number of workers and peasant masses. In this way, scientific research work will bloom with brilliant flowers.

    动员起来  向科学大进军
    江西举行第一次全省科学工作会议
    本报庐山25日电　记者李连斌报道：江西省第一次全省科学工作会议从18日到24日在庐山隆重举行。出席会议的共一千零四十六人。其中有科学技术和文教工作者，有省、专区、市、县和乡的各级党政领导干部，有厂矿和农村的工作干部，有在科学技术方面获得优异成绩的工人和农民。国务院科学规划委员会、中国科学院和中央有关部门的负责同志都参加了会议，许多省也派了代表参加会议，交流经验。这次会议是在中共江西省委和省人民委员会的直接领导下进行的。在会议中，土专家和洋专家齐集一堂，交流经验，互相学习。
    这次会议的中心议题是：进一步打破迷信，解放思想，克服科学的神秘观点，号召和动员全省人民向科学大进军。在全省范围掀起技术革命和文化革命的新高潮。
    江西省科学工作委员会主任兼江西分院院长邵式平（省委书记、省长）代表中共江西省委和省人民委员会向大会作了报告。会议还总结了过去科学工作的新成就。
    目前江西省各级科学研究机构正在纷纷建立，大部分专区、市、县已经建立了科学研究所，全省各综合垦殖场已成立动植物研究园一百多个，广大工厂和农村的研究组织正如雨后春笋般地发展着。于都县全县四百二十一个农业社建立了五百一十八个农业科学技术研究组。各研究单位广泛地开展了科学研究工作。据不完全统计，全省正在进行上万项的科学研究工作，有的研究项目已经获得一定的成果。如全省各地普遍采用土法炼铁炼钢。莲花县各农业社的科学技术研究组，已经试验成功与推广人造大粪、磷钾等等十几种肥料，创造新式农具一百多种。全省创制许多技术复杂的新产品，许多产品质量超过英国。如江西省轻工业厅试制成功的紫罗兰酮含量达到98％，超过了英国（英国含量为95.8％）。一支科学技术文化大军正在江西省形成，只贵溪一个县就涌现科学技术革新积极分子二千四百多人。许多积极分子作出了杰出的贡献。被称为青年的米丘林的何来昌，培育成功一种秆壮、穗大、粒多的“州场一号”水稻优良品种，一穗有三百多粒，结实之多可与高粱相比。被称为“农民哲学家”的乐平县吴炳和，为了解决实际工作和生产中的问题，解决自己的思想认识问题，以求师的态度读了十几本有关哲学的书，对辩证唯物主义的根本原则有很深刻的体会，并在实际工作和生产中运用辩证唯物主义获得显著成效。
    最近一个时期，江西还提出了“十百千万”（十篇系统的经验总结，百篇马列主义论文，一千个理论教员，一万个辅导员）的要求和
  “五合一”（工作、学习、研究、写作、讲授相结合）等一系列的群众性的措施。
    为了适应大跃进的新形势的需要，会议决定在全省二万五千个农业社中发展科学技术研究员七十万人，工矿、学校发展三十万人。为了便于指挥作战，会议要求普遍建立科学研究机构。专区和市建立区
  （市）分院，县建立科学研究所，乡建立科学研究站，社和厂矿建立研究组。并要求各研究组织结合当前需要和长远需要，制订科学研究规划。为了实现上述要求，达到全民向科学大进军的目的。会议强调政治挂帅。各级领导干部自觉自动地把科学研究工作的领导责任放到肩上来。同时从科学上总结工人农民大跃进中的创造发明。通过总结的办法，把“五合一”推广到广大工人和农民群众中去。这样，科学研究工作就会开放出灿烂的花朵。（附图片）
