Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 17th: Damascus Radio reported tonight, citing news from Amman, that the landing of British invading forces in Jordan has caused great anger among the people of that country. Residents of Nablus on the West Bank of the Jordan River held demonstrations, chanting slogans of "Down with British and American Imperialism." The demonstrators clashed with security forces who rushed to the scene attempting to suppress them with tanks and armored vehicles. The demonstrations continued until evening.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 17th: According to Damascus Radio, Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, on behalf of the Lebanese rebel people's forces, issued a warning to the American occupation forces on July 17th, demanding their immediate withdrawal from Lebanon.

Salam said, "We declare that we will resist aggression with all our might, and we will unreservedly request assistance of any kind from the free people of the world."

Salam reiterated that the landing of American troops in Lebanon was a "naked aggression against our independence and a shameful act of undermining the United Nations Charter."

Damascus Radio broadcast on the evening of July 17th that several former Lebanese Prime Ministers and Speakers of Parliament sent telegrams on July 17th to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the President of the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Secretary-General, and all member states of the United Nations, condemning and protesting the landing of American troops in Lebanon. The telegram stated, "We believe that any hesitation in ordering the withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon will be the responsibility of the United Nations. The Lebanese people are determined to defend the sovereignty and independence of the country. The continued presence of the occupying forces hinders world peace and security." The telegram was signed by Ahmed al-Assad, Sabri Hamadeh, Abdullah Yafi, Saeb Salam, Ahmed Daouk, and Saïd Moula.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 17th: Damascus Radio reported on the evening of July 17th that an American jeep carrying a group of American invading soldiers attempted today to enter the Tariq al-Jadida district of Beirut, which is controlled by the rebel people's forces, but all of these invaders were arrested by the rebel people's forces, and the jeep was confiscated. After this incident, the headquarters of the People's Army warned the American occupation forces: "The occupying forces should bear full responsibility for any such attempts."

Damascus Radio also reported that American aircraft flew at low altitude over areas of Beirut controlled by the rebel people's forces on July 17th. The People's Army fired on these aircraft, forcing them to leave and preventing them from daring to reappear.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: Beirut dispatch: The three battalions of the U.S. Marines, numbering 5,400 men, that were scheduled to invade Lebanon have now all landed in Beirut. The third battalion invaded Lebanese territory today. At the same time, the American invaders continue to airlift troops to Lebanon from other places. Today, an advance force of American troops arrived in Beirut from the Adana military base in southern Turkey. The American side disguised these troops as being used to "replace" the U.S. Marines occupying Beirut International Airport. News has it that the United States will transport the U.S. 24th Division stationed in Adana to Lebanon to "replace" the Marines already there.

The American invading forces have occupied all important strategic locations in the city of Beirut. They are constantly provoking the Lebanese rebels, and have been met with retaliatory fire from the rebels.

Those with national pride in the Lebanese army and police are extremely dissatisfied with the United States sending troops to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. The Chamoun police headquarters in Beirut admitted today that approximately 160 policemen have defected to the rebel side with their weapons.
