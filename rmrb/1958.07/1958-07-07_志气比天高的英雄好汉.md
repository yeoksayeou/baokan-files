Heroes with Sky-High Aspirations

    After reading Comrade Xu Xiangguo’s letter (excerpt) to Minister Wang Zhen from the Great Northern Wilderness, we were deeply moved. The reason for this is not the harsh environment of the Great Northern Wilderness, but those people, those heroes with sky-high aspirations.

    Those who had never cooked before become cooks; those who put down the "Regulations" go to buy agricultural technical books; those who give up the chance to find love go to the remote Great Northern Wilderness from the South… What Comrade Xu Xiangguo wrote about is just a few of the heroes building the Great Northern Wilderness, but isn't this highly representative? In the Great Northern Wilderness, in Xinjiang, in all the frontier reclamation areas, thousands upon thousands of pioneers are working day and night, fighting against the severe cold and snow, fighting against wild animals, with their high socialist enthusiasm and soaring energy, to build the desolate frontier into the granary of the motherland. They despise hardship, create the future with confidence; they are revolutionary realists, and also revolutionary romanticists; they are people with noble communist style.

    Here, we would like to pay our respects to all comrades who are opening up the frontier on behalf of the readers! And we hope that more aspiring young people will go to the frontier!

    志气比天高的英雄好汉
    读了徐先国同志从北大荒给王震部长的来信（摘要），我们深深地被感动。这原因，不是由于北大荒的艰苦环境，而是那些人，那些志比天高的英雄好汉。
    从没有做过饭的去当炊事员；放下了“条令”去买农业技术书；放弃获得爱情的机会从南方去到遥远的北大荒……徐先国同志所写的，只是建设北大荒的英雄们中的几个人，然而，这岂不是具有很大的代表性吗？在北大荒，在新疆，在一切边疆的垦区，成千上万的开拓者在那里日夜劳动，他们以自己高度的社会主义热情和冲天干劲，同严寒、冰雪作斗争，同野兽作斗争，要把荒凉的边疆建设成祖国的谷仓。他们藐视艰苦，充满信心地创造未来；他们是革命的现实主义者，也是革命的浪漫主义者；他们是具有共产主义高尚风格的人。
    我们在这里代表读者们向所有开垦边疆的同志们致敬！并且希望更多的有志气的青年人，到边疆去！
