From One Hundred and Eighty Days Shortened to Seventy Days
Harbin Completes Construction of a Large Factory Ahead of Schedule

(According to Heilongjiang Daily) The Third Work Section of the First Engineering Office of the Northeast Third Engineering Company boldly adopted the rapid construction method and completed an industrial factory building of 12,495 square meters in seventy days, creating the latest achievement in industrial building construction.

This factory building project is a prefabricated reinforced concrete structure, multi-span, multi-story, and structurally complex. It has one hundred and eight prefabricated reinforced concrete columns, as well as prestressed reinforced concrete roof trusses and steel bracket beams, etc. Various prefabricated components amounted to more than 2,900 tons, and there were also basement and four-story living quarters and other projects. According to the characteristics of the project, the work section widely adopted factory-based and mechanized construction. Prefabricated components accounted for more than 95% of the reinforced concrete work. Many individual projects produced semi-finished products from the factory, which were completed as soon as they were installed, reducing many complicated construction procedures and speeding up the project progress. Factory production shortened the construction period by three months compared with on-site prefabrication in the past, and improved the quality of the project. Mechanized and semi-mechanized construction was adopted in key projects such as hoisting, formwork support, steel welding, vertical and horizontal transportation, which greatly shortened the construction period. The hoisting project alone was shortened from the original plan of forty days to twenty days. In the construction, the hoisting was taken as the leading work procedure, and multi-discipline vertical and horizontal cross-construction operations were carried out, so that the shell, roof and internal projects occupied less time, and other projects did not occupy construction time, speeding up project progress and preventing the phenomenon of work stoppages and wasted labor. In order to ensure the supply of materials for rapid construction, a dedicated supply system was implemented, combining comprehensive preparation with current needs, and repeated balancing work was carried out to ensure the supply of materials.

In the past, it generally took a year to build such a large factory building. Due to the adoption of the rapid construction method, the work section shortened the construction period from the original plan of one hundred and eighty days to seventy days.

    从一百八十天缩短到七十天
    哈尔滨提前建成一座大厂房
    据黑龙江日报报道  东北第三工程公司第一工程处第三工段大胆采用了快速施工法，七十天建成了一座一万二千四百九十五平方公尺的工业厂房，创造了工业建筑施工的最新成就。
    这座厂房工程是钢筋混凝土装配式、多跨间、多层和结构复杂，有一百零八根钢筋混凝土预制柱，还有预应力钢筋混凝土屋架梁和钢托架梁等，各种预制件达二千九百多吨，并有地下室和四层楼的生活间等工程。该工段根据工程的特点，广泛地采用了工厂化和机械化的施工，预制构件占钢筋混凝土工程量的95％以上，许多单项工程从工厂生产出半成品，只要安装上即告完工，减少了很多复杂的施工程序，加快了工程进度。工厂生产和过去现场预制比较，缩短了三个月的工期，提高了工程质量。在吊装、支模、钢筋焊接、垂直和水平运输等关键工程采取了机械化和半机械化施工，也都大大的缩短了工期。仅吊装工程由原来计划四十天，缩短到二十天完成。在施工中，采取以吊装为主导工序，进行多工种纵横立体交错施工作业，使外壳、屋面和内部工程少占工期，其它工程不占用工期，加快工程进度，防止了停工窝工的现象。为保证快速施工的物资供应，实行了专责供应制，全面准备和当前需要相结合和反复的进行了平衡工作等办法，保证了物资供应。
    建设这样一座巨大的厂房，过去一般的需要一年的时间，该段由于采取了快速施工法，工期从原来一百八十天的计划，缩短到七十天建成。
