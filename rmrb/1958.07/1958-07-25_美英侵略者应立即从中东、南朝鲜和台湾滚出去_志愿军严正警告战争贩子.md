Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th: The aggressive actions of U.S. and British imperialism in the Middle East have aroused boundless anger among all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In the past week, CPV units have held thousands of meetings of all sizes, sternly warning U.S. and British warmongers to remember the lessons of their disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, not to play with fire and burn themselves, and to immediately get out of the Middle East, South Korea, and our Taiwan.

    At a rally at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Ding Laifu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said: "Just as we are withdrawing from Korea to our motherland in batches to promote the easing of tensions in the Far East and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the American aggressors are not only failing to withdraw their troops from South Korea, but are igniting new flames of war in the Middle East, which cannot but make us extremely angry. We have every reason to demand that they immediately get out of the Middle East, South Korea, and Taiwan."

    At countless rallies, officers and soldiers angrily exposed the towering crimes of the American aggressors. They said, "We have personally witnessed the burning, killing, and raping of the Korean people by the executioners, and we will not allow U.S. and British imperialism to impose such crimes on the people of the Middle East." Zhao Jihua, a second-class hero and first-class meritorious soldier who once led two soldiers on "Old Baldy" to repel seven charges by an American invading company in one day, wiping out more than 110 enemies, said: "For the sake of peace, we went to the Korean battlefield and joined the Korean people in opposing imperialist armed aggression. Many of my comrades have sacrificed their precious lives for peace. Today, when peace is threatened, we cannot remain indifferent. I will continue to hold the weapon in my hand and be ready to teach those warmongers a lesson at any time."

    All officers and soldiers utterly despise the American aggressor army as a paper tiger. When the U.S. invading 24th Division invaded Lebanon, Captain Bai Caizhang, a reconnaissance staff officer of a certain unit, said, "This defeated soldier at the hands of the Chinese and Korean people has come to the Middle East to seek death again! Our first battle in Korea was with them, and they threw away their helmets and armor and fled as soon as they came into contact with us. In the Second Campaign, they put the puppet Rhee army on the front line and the British and Turkish henchmen on the second line, hiding themselves at the rear, but they still did not escape the blow of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and their 34th Regiment was completely annihilated. I saw more than 20 24-inch caliber cannons abandoned by them in Bochuan." Captain Luo Zaiwei of a certain unit introduced the ugly behavior of American soldiers suffering from "startle disease" on the Korean battlefield: "They squatted in tanks while on guard at night, and the area around their驻地 was brightly lit with searchlights. When the searchlights occasionally malfunctioned and stopped for two minutes, the American soldiers panicked and fired countless flares." Lieutenant Wang Cunbao, who participated in the Battle of Shangganling, said: "The American bandits are not difficult to fight. Our troops shot down and damaged 91 American aircraft in forty days." Xue Keyang, a commander who once led troops to teach the American invading army a lesson on the Yuyinshan front, said at a conference: "Five years ago today, we were heavily attacking the U.S. 45th Division. One of our reinforced platoons wiped out more than 200 of them in eight minutes. If the American aggressors are not forgetful, they should remember these lessons and get out of the Middle East as soon as possible, and not seek their own death."

    Now, all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers are paying close attention to the changes in the Middle East situation and the activities of the U.S. and Rhee armies in South Korea with a hundredfold vigilance, ready to strike at enemies who dare to undermine peace at any time.

### 美英侵略者应立即从中东、南朝鲜和台湾滚出去  志愿军严正警告战争贩子

    美英侵略者应立即从中东、南朝鲜和台湾滚出去
    志愿军严正警告战争贩子
    新华社平壤24日电　美英帝国主义对中东地区的侵略行动，激起了中国人民志愿军全体官兵的无比愤怒。一周来，志愿军各部队举行了上千个大小集会，严正警告美英战争贩子要记取它们在朝鲜战场上的惨败教训，不要玩火自焚，立即从中东、南朝鲜和我国台湾滚出去。
    在志愿军总部的集会上，中国人民志愿军政治部副主任丁莱夫将军说：正当我们为了促进远东紧张局势的缓和，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，从朝鲜分批撤回祖国的时候，美国侵略者不仅不撤出它们在南朝鲜的军队，反而在中东燃起新的战火，这不能不使我们格外愤怒，我们有充分理由要求它们立即滚出中东、南朝鲜和台湾。
    在无数次的集会上，官兵们怒不可遏地揭露了美国侵略者的滔天罪行。他们说，我们亲眼看到过刽子手们对朝鲜人民的烧杀、奸淫，我们不容许美英帝国主义把这种罪行强加在中东人民的头上。曾在“老秃山”上率领两个战士，一天打退美国侵略军一个连七次冲锋，消灭敌人一百一十多名的二级英雄、一等功臣赵积华说：我们为了和平，奔赴朝鲜战场和朝鲜人民一起反对帝国主义的武装侵略。我的许多战友为了和平献出了自己宝贵的生命。今天，当和平受到威胁的时候，我们不能置之不理。我要继续握紧手中武器，随时准备教训那些战争贩子。
    全体官兵极其藐视美国侵略军这个纸老虎。当美国侵略军第二十四师侵入黎巴嫩的时候，某部侦察参谋白采章上尉说，这个中朝人民手下的败卒又到中东去找死啦！我们入朝的第一仗就是和它较量的，它和我们一接触就丢盔掉甲地逃跑了。第二次战役中，它把李伪军放在第一线，把英、土帮凶军放在第二线，自己躲在最后，可是它仍然没有逃脱中朝人民军队的打击，它的第三十四团整个被击溃了。我在博川就看到它丢下了二十四吋口径的大炮二十多门。某部罗在伟上尉介绍了美国兵在朝鲜战场上患“吃惊病”的丑态：它们晚上站岗蹲在坦克里，驻地四周用探照灯照得通明。探照灯偶而发生故障停了两分钟，美国兵就慌作一团，打出无数的照明弹。参加过上甘岭战役的王存保中尉说：“美国强盗并不难打，我们部队四十天就击落击伤美国飞机九十一架。曾经率领部队在鱼隐山前线教训过美国侵略军的指挥员薛克扬在一次大会上说：“五年前的今天，我们正在沉重打击美军四十五师，我们一个加强排八分钟就消灭了它二百多人。美国侵略者如果不健忘的话，应该记取这些教训，趁早滚出中东，不要自找死亡。”
    现在，志愿军全体官兵都在百倍警惕地注视着中东局势的变化和美、李军在南朝鲜的活动，准备随时打击敢于破坏和平的敌人。
