Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units stationed on the western coastal islands of Korea have completely withdrawn from the islands and arrived in designated areas to await orders to return home. During their withdrawal, they were deeply seen off by the Korean people and army on the islands.

On the eve of the Volunteer Army's withdrawal, the people of Ai Island sent forty-five representatives with a fat pig, six chickens, more than forty bottles of wine, and one hundred and sixty catties of rice to the Volunteer Army's station to have a meal and drink with the officers and soldiers. The fishermen of the Dongpu Fishery Production Cooperative of Tieshan County, who come to Xiaohai Island to fish during the annual fishing season, also sent the director of the cooperative's management committee and fourteen fishermen with forty catties of dried shrimp, forty catties of fresh fish, and other gifts to Xiaohai Island late at night to bid farewell. The girls of Duan Island sewed more than two hundred toothbrush bags overnight and gave them to the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on the island as souvenirs.

The eight elderly fishermen from Ai Island who had encountered danger at sea invited the platoon leader and soldiers of the 5th squad of a certain Volunteer Army unit who rescued them to the boat, asked them to drink, and bid them farewell with tears. On September 13 last year, these eight old men, with an average age of sixty-four and a half, were fishing in two fishing boats when they suddenly encountered a storm and hailstorm. The masts of the boats were broken, and the fishing boats were blown away. The Volunteer Army units on Ai Island, upon hearing this news, immediately dispatched platoon leader Shen Jinfu and the soldiers of the 5th squad to risk going to sea to rescue them. They searched in the stormy waves around six or seven islands in their small boat and rescued the eight old men who had fainted on the boat. At the time of parting, eighty-year-old Wei Junyi gave an ancestral antique bronze wine cup to platoon leader Shen Jinfu.

On the day before the Volunteer Army units withdrew from the islands, the people of each island held warm farewell meetings. The Volunteer Army units and representatives of the Korean people and army on the island exchanged words of farewell and presented each other with commemorative gifts at the meeting. Then, from dusk to dawn, everyone surrounded the national flags of China and Korea, singing and dancing, talking all night long. People's Army Colonel Kim Gun-se and a Volunteer Army soldier signed each other's names as souvenirs. Colonel Kim Gun-se wrote: "The ocean is deep, but not as deep as our friendship!" The Volunteer Army soldier wrote: "The river is long, but not as long as our friendship!"

As the time of departure approached, the residents and People's Army officers and soldiers of each island accompanied the Volunteer Army to the ferry, crossing mountains and ridges. When the ships set sail, shouts, songs, and the farewell whistles of the ships resounded. Many people jumped into the sea, which reached their thighs, waving goodbye to the departing Volunteer Army officers and soldiers. (Attached pictures)

    驻守朝鲜西部沿海各岛的志愿军全部撤离
    朝鲜军民深情送别难离难舍
    新华社平壤3日电　驻守朝鲜西部沿海各岛屿的中国人民志愿军部队，已经全部撤离海岛，开抵指定地区待命归国。他们在撤离时，受到岛上朝鲜军民的深情送别。
    艾岛人民在志愿军部队撤离前夕，派出四十五位代表，带了一头肥猪、六只鸡、四十多瓶酒和一百六十斤大米，赶到志愿军部队驻地和官兵们一起聚餐畅饮。每年鱼汛期到小和岛捕鱼的铁山郡东浦渔业生产合作社的渔民们，也派了这个社的管理委员长和十四个渔民带了四十斤虾干、四十斤鲜鱼和其他礼物，深夜赶到小和岛送别。椴岛的姑娘们星夜缝制了两百多个牙具袋，赠给岛上的志愿军官兵留念。
    曾在海上遇险的八位艾岛老渔民，把抢救他们脱险的志愿军某部二排长和五班士兵请到船上，请他们喝酒，含泪送别。去年9月13日，这八位平均年龄六十四岁半的老人驾着两只渔船出海捕鱼时，突然遇到暴风雨和冰雹的袭击，船上的桅杆被吹折了，渔船被刮得不知去向。艾岛上的志愿军部队听到这个消息，立即派二排长沈金福带领五班战士冒险出海抢救。他们驾着小船在风雨怒涛中搜索遍六、七个海岛附近的海面，救起了昏倒在船上的八位老人。在分别时，八十岁的魏俊一老人把一只祖传的古铜酒杯赠给了沈金福排长。
    在志愿军部队撤离海岛的前一天，各岛人民都举行了热烈的欢送大会。志愿军部队和岛上朝鲜军民代表在会上互道惜别之情，互赠纪念礼品。接着，从黄昏到黎明，大家一直围着中朝两国国旗边歌边舞，通宵话别。人民军金君世上校和一个志愿军战士互相签名留念，金君世上校写的是：“海洋深，没有我们的友谊深！”志愿军战士写的是：“江水长，没有我们的友谊长！”
    在即将离别的时候，各岛居民和人民军官兵翻山越岭一直伴送志愿军到渡口。当船只起航时，口号声、歌声和船上告别的汽笛声响成一片。许多人还跳进淹到大腿的海水里，向渐渐远去的志愿军官兵挥手送行。（附图片）
