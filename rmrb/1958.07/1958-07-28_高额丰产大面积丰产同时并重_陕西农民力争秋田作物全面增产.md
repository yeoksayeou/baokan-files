Simultaneously Emphasizing High-Yielding Model Fields and Large-Area High-Yielding Fields: Shaanxi Farmers Strive for Comprehensive Increase in Autumn Crop Production

    (Our dispatch) Shaanxi Province's farmers are currently promoting the successful experiences gained from cultivating high-yielding model fields to large-area high-yielding fields during the management of autumn crops.

    This year, Shaanxi farmers have been extensively experimenting with planting high-yielding fields. According to incomplete statistics from sixty-six counties, over one thousand agricultural cooperatives plan to cultivate three to four thousand mu of high-yielding model fields. For example, Pan Dailao and others from the Lichao First Cooperative in Dali County are experimenting with one mu of high-yielding sweet potatoes, with a planned yield of 240,000 jin per mu; Liu Shuxian and others from the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County are cultivating two mu of high-yielding corn, with a planned yield of 20,000 jin per mu. However, these high-yielding fields require ten times more fertilizer than ordinary fields, and field management is particularly labor-intensive, which has affected the field management and fertilizer supply of some large-area high-yielding fields.

    After discovering this problem, relevant departments in Shaanxi Province believe that the emergence of high-yielding model fields is a new characteristic of the current great leap forward in agricultural production, and it will powerfully stimulate the increase in production of large-area high-yielding fields. However, while doing a good job in cultivating high-yielding model fields, all localities must immediately find ways to open up fertilizer sources, allocate labor, improve labor efficiency, and strengthen field management of large-area high-yielding fields to strive for larger areas of high-yield.

    In the past month, the following measures have been taken in various localities to ensure that high-yielding model fields and large-area high-yielding fields advance simultaneously:

    First, agricultural cooperatives in various localities have made overall plans for high-yielding model fields and large-area high-yielding fields respectively, and have rationally allocated existing manpower and materials.

    Second, the professional management responsibility system for autumn crops is being universally promoted to give full play to everyone's initiative and enthusiasm. For example, agricultural cooperatives in Hancheng County have contracted all high-yielding model fields and large-area high-yielding fields to various teams, groups, and individuals, ensuring that various field farm work is completed on time according to quantity and quality plans. At the same time, responsibility areas are established according to crop classification.

    Third, when organizing high-yield competitions, various localities regard large-area high-yield as one of the competition conditions, so as to promote each other and achieve comprehensive high-yield.

    While conscientiously implementing the simultaneous emphasis on high-yielding model fields and large-area high-yielding fields, farmers in various localities are also vigorously promoting high-yield experiences in conjunction with current autumn field management. Zhang Qiuxiang, a national agricultural labor model, has a wealth of experience in cotton planting technology. Since this spring, she has created three management experiences for seedlings. Relevant departments in Shaanxi Province promptly organized representatives of agricultural cooperatives from more than 20 major cotton-producing counties in the province to visit and learn, and quickly promoted these experiences to the cotton fields in Guanzhong. As a result of better management during the seedling stage, the cotton in various localities developed faster and bloomed seven days earlier than in previous years. At the same time, due to the adoption of classification and ranking, hierarchical management methods, and successive surprise attacks on third-class fields, more than 70% of the cotton in the Guanzhong area has reached the level of high-yielding fields in previous years. Based on their experience and lessons learned in previous years of production, farmers in Chang'an County have grasped the key to high yield, which is to ensure the survival of seedlings. In early July, they organized a surprise attack team of 190,000 people to inspect and replant seedlings and add fertilizer to each plot of the county's 500,000 mu of autumn fields, basically eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings and sparse planting. This year, more than 100 mu of rice in various counties in the Hanzhong Basin of Shaanxi have also grown vigorously due to the adoption of new technologies such as frequent watering, shallow irrigation, and reasonable field drying, as well as increased weeding and topdressing.

### 高额丰产大面积丰产同时并重  陕西农民力争秋田作物全面增产

    高额丰产大面积丰产同时并重
    陕西农民力争秋田作物全面增产
    本报讯　陕西省农民在秋田管理中，正把高额丰产田创造的成功经验在大面积丰产田里推广。
    今年陕西农民大量试种丰产田。据六十六个县不完全统计，有一千多个农业社计划种植三、四千亩高额丰产田。如大荔县荔潮一社潘呆劳等试种的一亩丰产甘薯，计划亩产二十四万斤；渭南县和平农业社刘述贤等人培育的二亩丰产玉米，计划亩产两万斤。但这些丰产田所施的肥料比一般地要多成十倍，田间管理也特别费工，因而影响了一部分大面积丰产田的田间管理工作和肥料供应。
    陕西省有关部门发现这个问题后，认为高额丰产田的出现，是当前农业生产大跃进的新特点，它将有力地刺激大面积丰产田增产。但是，各地必须在搞好高额丰产田的同时，立即设法开辟肥源，调配劳力，提高劳动效率，加强大面积丰产田的田间管理，争取更大面积的高额丰产。
    最近一个月来，各地已采取了以下的办法，保证高额丰产田和大面积丰产田同时并进：
    第一，各地农业社分别对高额丰产田和大面积丰产田进行了统筹规划，并把现有的人力物力进行合理分配。
    第二，普遍推行秋田作物专业管理责任制，发挥每一个人的主动性和积极性。如韩城县各农业社把所有高额丰产田和大面积丰产田分别包给各队、组和个人，保证田间各种农活按时完成数量和质量计划，同时，按照作物分类建立责任区。
    第三，各地在组织高额丰产竞赛时，把大面积丰产作为竞赛条件之一，以便互相促进，全面丰产。
    在认真贯彻高额丰产田和大面积丰产田并重的同时，各地农民还结合当前的秋田管理，大力推广高额丰产经验。全国农业劳动模范张秋香在植棉技术上有很多经验，今春以来，她又创造了三项管理幼苗的经验。陕西省有关部门及时组织全省二十多个主要产棉县的农业社代表，前往参观学习，迅速把这些经验推广到关中各地的棉田里去。使各地的棉花在幼苗期由于管理较好，发育较快，比往年提前七天开花。同时由于采取了分类排队，分级管理的办法，轮番突击三类田，因而，目前关中地区的棉花有70％以上，都达到往年丰产田的水平。长安县农民根据历年生产中的经验教训，抓住了高产必须保苗的关键，在7月上旬，组织了十九万人的突击队伍，对全县五十万亩秋田，逐块进行查苗补苗、加工加肥，基本消灭了缺苗稀植现象。陕西汉中盆地各县的一百多亩水稻，今年也由于采取勤浇、浅灌，合理晒田的新技术，并增加了捞草、追肥次数，大部分稻苗生长茁壮。
