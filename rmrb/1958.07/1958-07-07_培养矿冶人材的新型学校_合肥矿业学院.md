A New Type of School Cultivating Mining and Metallurgical Talents
    Hefei Mining Institute

    In recent years, Hefei Mining Institute has supplied more than 1,700 senior technical cadres to the coal industry front. Now, from the southeastern coast of the motherland to Xinjiang in the northwest; from the scorching southwest to the frigid northeast, in every coal mining area, coal mine construction site, coal mine design institute, or school training technical cadres for the coal industry, there are graduates from this school.

    Hefei Mining Institute was established in 1955. Currently, the school has six departments, including Mineral Geology and Exploration, Mine Construction and Architecture, Mining, Mechanical Manufacturing, and Chemical Engineering, and five specialties. Starting this year, to support the great leap forward in industrial production, six new specialties have been added: Mechanical Manufacturing Technology and Equipment, Iron and Steel Metallurgy, Power Plant Power Grid and Power Systems, Inorganic Materials Science, Basic Organic Synthesis, and Industrial and Civil Architecture. This summer, it will enroll more than 1,400 students, with a current student body of over 2,500. At present, workers and peasants account for more than 40%, including former coal miners or farmers, as well as soldiers who participated in the North-South campaigns. Based on the current nature of the courses and teaching needs, twenty-five teaching and research groups and thirty experimental factories and laboratories have been established. In the future, with the needs of teaching new specialties, new teaching and research groups and new laboratories and factories will continue to be established.

    In recent years, the school has also extensively carried out scientific research work. Now, the school teachers are advancing towards cutting-edge science, applying the world's latest scientific and technological achievements to their own technical sciences, striving to completely change the school's appearance within five years.

    培养矿冶人材的新型学校
    合肥矿业学院
    合肥矿业学院几年来已为煤炭工业战线输送了一千七百多名高等技术干部。现在，从祖国东南的海边，到西北的新疆；从酷热的西南，到严寒的东北，不论哪个煤矿区，煤矿基建工地、煤矿设计机关或者培养煤炭工业技术干部的学校，都有这个学校的毕业生。
    合肥矿业学院是1955年建立的。现在，这所学校设有矿产地质及勘探、矿井建设及建筑、矿区开采、机械制造、化学工程等六个系、五个专业外，今年起，为了支援工业生产大跃进，增设机械制造工艺及其设备、钢铁冶金、发电厂电力网及电力系统、无机物工学、基本有机合成、工业与民用建筑等六个专业。今年暑期招生一千四百余人，现有学生二千五百余人。现在，工农成分占40％以上，其中有过去的煤炭工人或农民，也有参加过南征北战的战士。根据目前课程性质和教学需要，已经设立了二十五个教研组和三十个实验厂、室，今后随着新增专业教学的需要，还要继续建立新的教研组和新的试验室、工厂。
    几年来，这所学校还广泛开展了科学研究工作。现在，学校教师们正在向尖端科学进军，要把世界上最新的科学技术成就，应用到本门技术科学上来。力争五年内彻底改变学校面貌。　（秦聿震）
