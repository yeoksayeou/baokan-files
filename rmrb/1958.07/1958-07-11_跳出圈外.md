    Breaking Out of the Circle
    Wan Guoru, Worker at Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory

    With the Great Leap Forward, the work for the maintenance group was no longer enough to "eat." Everyone was full of energy but had nowhere to unleash it, so they just took it out on the group leader, old An.
    "We're suffocating with pent-up energy, can't you see that as the group leader? This Great Leap Forward is just deflating us!"
    Actually, old An was more worried than anyone else about not having enough tasks, but as the leader of the group, he had to suppress his anger inside.
    Today, the maintenance group had another "family meeting," and it was a disaster. Because the next month's tasks were released, the arrangement showed that there would be eight working days with no work to do. Moreover, Master Huo, who was in charge of technical innovation, had proposed two new suggestions. Both of these suggestions were measures to improve work efficiency: one was to use a machine to replace manual filing of flat screws, and the other was the "double-lathe filing method." This would mean even less work to do next month. After calculation, there would be twelve days of surplus working hours, which meant everyone would have to "go hungry" for twelve days.
    So, everyone stopped discussing the plan seriously and started to nitpick the group leader one by one. One said: "This month I've been so idle that my joints ache, are you going to let us just sit around next month too?" Another said: "You can use any method to control me, I can even go three days without food, but I can't stand not having work to do!"
    While everyone was complaining, someone outside started beating the gong to report good news again. Since the Great Leap Forward, this has become a new custom. When any group achieves something, they have to beat the gongs and drums and make a big fuss, as if they have reason to make the drum sound thunderous, making people's blood rush to their heads.
    However, this fiery sound of gongs and drums was heartbreaking for the maintenance group. They had never had the chance to shine in front of the factory and report their achievements to the Party committee with a big red banner. Because they didn't have enough work, they felt inferior to other groups, and even the courage to watch the excitement was dwindling.
    The problem of the maintenance group not having enough work had started two or three months ago.
    Before that, they were just mill donkeys - doing whatever they were told. For example, if a production group's machine broke down, they would look for them, and they would take hammers and wrenches to fix it, which was slow and delayed production.
    After the Great Leap Forward, they also made a leap forward, changing from passive to active and implementing a cyclical machine repair method, changing from waiting for work to finding work. But while they were leaping forward, the production groups weren't taking small steps either. In addition to improving their own work, the production groups came up with a way to break out of the circle: when machines had problems, they fixed them themselves, no longer looking for the maintenance group, leaving the maintenance group behind.
    This left the machine repairers with no work to do. They went to the production groups to argue, saying that they were stealing their work. But the production groups' reasons were sufficient: repairing their own machines was faster and more accurate. Helpless, they had to transfer the people who specialized in repairing machines to the machine parts manufacturing section. But the task of machine parts manufacturing wasn't very busy either. Originally, twenty or so people were just barely busy enough manufacturing machine parts for the factory itself, but with the increase in manpower, it became even more apparent that there were more people than work. In addition, people were constantly innovating technically, improving this today and improving that tomorrow, and in no time at all, the tasks were "eaten up" with seven or eight days left in the month.
    Because they weren't "full," group leader old An had gone to the workshop director Bai Yongyi many times, but he didn't realize that the director was also worried about the lack of tasks, giving him a headache.
    In the past, when old An went to the director, the director said: "Your work is different in nature, you are an auxiliary process, understand? The main thing is to maintain the machines, repair them well so that they don't stop, and that's 100% completion of the task. As for not having enough work, cough, that's a good thing, it's enough to prove that your work is excellent. If there's less work, just relax a little, you're like firefighters, just being there is glorious." He coaxed old An away with these words.
    This time, old An ran to the director's office and saw that the room was full of people. It was after ten o'clock at night, the light in the room was stained yellowish-white by the smoke, and everyone in the room was looking for the director to increase their tasks. The voices were chaotic, as if they were fighting.
    Director Bai Yongyi, surrounded by people, shouted in a hoarse voice:
    "Yesterday you said to increase production by 20%, why is it more again today?"
    "Can you blame me for that?" From the voice, old An knew it was the sewing group leader Xie Ming. "Today, after studying the general line, everyone implemented the fast cloth joining method, so production greatly increased again."
    "That doesn't count," the director said. "In the future, anyone who wants to increase production must register in advance. If anyone does it secretly, and there's not enough work at the end of the month, they will be held fully responsible for the shutdown."
    "But we increased it today!"
    "That won't work either, it's not approved. Who's next?" the director shouted at the others.
    Old An was last in line, his heart burning with anxiety. He finally got his turn, but as soon as the director saw him, he waved his hand and said, "Old fellow, your problem can't be solved!"
    "Why not?" old An couldn't hold back his anger.
    "Haven't I said it several times? The nature of your group's work is different."
    "Here we go again!" old An roared,
    "I'm making it clear today, if you don't solve our problem, I'm quitting as group leader!"
    "But what can be done?" the director clicked his tongue. "What do you suggest?"
    "We also want to break out of the circle!" Old An blurted out his half-formed idea, "If we don't break out of the circle now, it won't work. Look, the production groups are forcibly taking our maintenance work, isn't that breaking out of the circle? We're a dyeing factory, now we're dyeing homespun cloth and sand cloth, isn't that also breaking out of the circle? Our maintenance group also wants to break out of the circle of only manufacturing parts for our own factory, and process for others, make machines for other factories."
    "What?" the director was taken aback. "We're a dyeing factory, not an iron factory, making machines? What are you thinking?"
    "Now we have to break the rules, do whatever we can do."
    "But can we manufacture machines?"
    "Why not?"
    "Who would let us manufacture their machines?"
    This question silenced old An. Really, where would he find someone to make machines for?
    Just then, there was a commotion outside, and someone ran into the room and shouted:
    "Great news, we've successfully trial-produced dyeing cotton cloth without using dyes!" This shout was crucial, people couldn't bother to argue about anything else, and like a tide, they rushed towards the workshop.
    Only old An was left in the room. He failed to stop the director, and he became angry all by himself. Regarding the news of dyeing cloth without dyes, even though he was an outsider, he understood that the other groups had created a new miracle. Combining this with his own group, he became even more annoyed: "Write a big-character poster for him!" In his anger, he saw pen and ink on the table, grabbed the paper, and started writing.
    He originally wanted to criticize the director's conservative thinking, but as he wrote, he went off-topic. He wrote about the process of his group "not being full." The more he wrote, the more he felt a little sad, and he didn't know how the grievances came up again, and he wrote six lines of doggerel:
    We have soaring energy, but it's hard when there's no work,
    We dare not go on the stage, we have no martial arts competition,
    We're all in the Great Leap Forward, who can we complain to?
    After writing, he pasted the big-character poster in the most obvious place in the yard and went back to sleep.
    When he woke up, he thought about the affairs of their maintenance group again. As he was thinking, he saw the refining group leader Zhao Wang rush in like a gust of wind.
    "You old fellow, you wrote a big-character poster and it's nothing to you."
    "What's the matter, all our work has been stolen by you, we have no work to do, we can only sleep peacefully!"
    "You fellow, don't just keep mocking people!" Zhao Wang said loudly, "Do you know what I'm here for?"
    "The Great Leap Forward stands out, beautiful, you're strolling around because you have nothing to do."
    "You're wrong. I'm here to tell you a great joy." "It's like this: this morning, as soon as we got off work, everyone saw your big-character poster and felt that what you said was right. Originally, with so many of you, it's impossible to use all your energy just making parts for the factory, and you should also find some extra-plan products. Everyone discussed it and felt that your group was too 'hungry,' and didn't even have the energy to sleep, so they went out to 'hunt for food' for you separately."
    "Find what way?" Old An sat up in a jerk at this time.
    "Listen to me, all the people on the night shift mobilized together, and each person went to the factories they knew to inquire. Guess what happened after this inquiry?"
    "Is there any?" Old An asked, staring.
    "There is. There are a lot," Zhao Wang no longer deliberately made old An anxious, "Many factories are expanding, lacking machines and parts, and they are looking for iron factories to process them but can't find them."
    "Is it true?"
    "Who would lie to you!"
    "Great!" Old An did a carp jump out of bed, didn't even bother to put on his shoes, and ran outside in his vest. Coincidentally, someone else came in hurriedly, and the two ran into each other.
    The person who came was the workshop director Bai Yongyi. He was seen covering his sore nose and shouting: "You old fellow, why didn't you register in advance? Now you hurry to the factory and take a look, it's a mess, many factory directors and secretaries have all come. The factory director wants me to find you quickly. I heard that they are asking our factory for help, to make parts and make machines. I don't know how their ears are so long, how did they know we have no work to do? But how much surplus working hours do we have after all? Besides making parts for the factory, how much can we do for outside the factory, and what can we do?..."
    He only cared about covering his nose and shouting, and old An had already run off without a trace.

专栏：跃进之歌

    跳出圈外
    天津织染厂工人　万国儒
    一跃进，保全组的活儿不够“吃”了，大伙满身干劲没处施展，就光拿组长老安头撒气。
    “我们混身憋的难受，你当组长的看不见吗？跃进，咱们简直是泄劲！”
    其实，任务不够干的，老安头比谁都着急，只不过他是一组之长，硬把火压在心里罢了。
    今天保全组又开“家务会”，这个会开得很糟。因为下月份的任务下来了，一安排有八个工作日没活可干，而且，负责技术革新的霍师傅又把两项新建议提出来。这两项建议都是提高工作效率的措施。一项是用机器代替人工锉扁螺丝；一项是“双车锉扁法”。这样一来，下月份的活就更不够干了。经过测算要有十二天敷余工时，就是说，要有十二天大伙得挨“饿”。
    于是，大伙就不再正正经经地讨论计划了，一对一句的刁难起组长来。这个说：“这月份就闲得我骨头节疼，下月还让人呆着？”那个说：“用什么办法制我都行，就是三天不吃饭也可以，可是不给活干，我受不了！”
    大伙正七言八语发牢骚，忽然院外有谁又敲起报捷的锣鼓来了。从跃进以来，这是种新风俗，那个组搞出点什么事迹，都要锣鼓喧天大闹一番，就像得着理似的，把鼓敲得雷响，让人听了心血往上冲。
    可是，这火暴的锣鼓声音，对于保全组说来是扎心的。他们还没有一次敲锣打鼓的在全厂人们面前光彩过，抬着大红牌向党委报捷。因为活不够干，他们都觉着比别的小组矮一头，就连看热闹的勇气也不大了。
    说起保全组活不够干的事来，前两三个月就发生了。
    在此以前，他们干的尽是磨坊驴——听喝的活。比如，人家生产小组机器坏了，找他们来，他们才拿鎯头找扳子去修，又慢又耽搁人家生产。
    跃进后，他们也跃进了，变被动为主动，实行起循环修机法，由等活干变成找活干。可是他们跃进，人家生产小组也没小步跑。生产小组除了本工作上改进外，又想出一个跳出圈外的办法；机器出了毛病，自己动手修理，不再去找保全组，把保全组给甩了。
    这一甩，管修机的就没活可干了，他们找各生产小组去打架，说人家抢走了他们的活。可人家生产小组的理由很充足：自己开机器自己修、又快又拿准。没办法，他们只好把专门修理机器的人调到机件制造这部分来。可是机件制造的任务也并不怎么忙，原来二十来人，专给本厂制造机器零件就不够忙活的，这人一增多，就更显得人多活少了。再加上人们闹革新技术，今天他改进这个，明天他改进那个，三下五除二，离月底差七八天就把任务“吃光”了。
    因为吃不饱，组长老安头曾找过车间主任白永义好多次，可他没想到，主任也正为任务不足急得脑袋胀呢。
    过去，老安头找到主任，主任说：“你们的工作性质不同，你是辅助工序，明白吗？主要是维护机器，修理好不停车，做到这一点就算百分之百完成任务了。至于活不够干，咳，这是好现象，这足以证明你们的工作干得倍棒，活少，就轻松点吧，你们和消防队员一样，呆着是光荣的。”就这样连说带哄，把老安头就哄弄走了。
    这回，老安头跑到主任办公室，见屋子里满喳喳一大屋子人。这是夜里十点多钟，屋里灯光被烟雾染成黄白色，屋子里的人都是找主任增加任务的。声音很嘈乱，好像在打架。
    主任白永义，被人们包围着，哑着嗓子喊：
    “昨天你说提高产量20％，今天怎么又多了？”
    “这能怨我吗？”听语音，老安头知道那是缝纫组长谢明，“昨天一学习总路线，今天大伙就实行了快速接布法，于是产量又大大地提高了。”
    “这不能算数。”主任说，“以后谁要是提高产量必须提前登记。如果谁偷偷干了，到月底活供不上，就要他负停工的全部责任。”
    “可我们这是今天提高的呀？”
    “那也不行，批不准。下边谁谈？”主任冲着别人喊。
    老安头轮在最后，心里急得直冒烟。好容易挨上了，可主任一见是他，忙把手一摆说：“老伙计，你的问题解决不了！”
    “为什么？”老安头按不住火了。
    “不是说过几次了吗？你们组的工作性质不同。”
    “又来这一套！”老安头吼着，
    “今儿说定了，要再不给我们解决问题，我这个组长不干了！”
    “可是，这有什么办法？”主任咂着牙花子，“你说怎么好？”
    “我们也要跳出圈外！”老安头把还未成熟的想法，脱口说出来，“现在不跳出圈外不行，你看，生产小组硬抢走我们保全的活，这不是跳出圈外吗？咱们是染厂，今个染土布、沙发布，这不也跳出圈外了吗？我们保全组也要跳出光制造本厂机件这个圈，对外加工，给别的工厂做机器。”
    “什么？”主任大吃一惊，“咱们是染厂，不是铁工厂，制机器？你想到哪去了？”
    “现在要打破常规，能干什么就干什么。”
    “可是咱们能制造机器吗？”
    “怎么不能？”
    “人家谁有机器让咱们制造？”
    这句话问得老安头不吱声了。真的，到哪找造机器的主儿啊？
    就这时候，只听院外一阵大乱，有人跑进屋来喊到：
      “天大的喜事，不用染料染棉布试制成功了！”这一喊不要紧，人们再顾不得吵什么了，像潮水一样，向车间奔去。
    屋里就剩下老安头自己了。他一把没拽住主任，就一个人生起气来。对于不用染料染布的消息，尽管他是外行，可也明白，这是人家小组又创造了新的奇迹。结合这些，他想到自己的小组，就越发气恼起来：“给他张大字报！”他在气头上，看到桌子上摆着笔墨，抓过纸来，就写开了。
    他本想批评一下主任的保守思想，但写着写着就走题了。他写起小组“吃不饱”的经过来了。越写越多，心里还有点难过，不知又怎么委屈上来，写下六句顺口溜：
    空有冲天劲，没活难上难，
    擂台不敢上，比武没有咱，
    同在大跃进，向谁去诉冤？
    写完之后，他把大字报贴到院里最明显的地方，就回去睡觉了。
    他醒来就又想到他们保全组的事，正想着，见精炼组长赵旺，像阵风似的闯了进来。
    “你这老家伙，写了大字报倒没事了。”
    “有什么事呀，我们的活全让你们给抢走了，没活可干，只能睡安心觉呗！”
    “你这家伙，别光老挖苦人！”赵旺大声说，“你知道我是干什么来了吗？”
    “跃进突出，美的，闲着没事蹓吧。”
    “你是想错了。我是来告诉你一件大喜事。”“是这样：今个早上一下班，大伙就看见你那张大字报，觉着你提得对。本来吗，你们这么多人，光给厂子制机件，是没法把劲全使出来，也应当找些计划外产品。大伙一讨论，觉着你们组‘饿’得太可怜了，连困劲也没了，分头为你们找路子‘打食’去了。”
    “找什么路子？”老安头这时一?碌坐起来。
    “你听我说呀，我们下夜班的全部人马一齐出动，个人去个人认识的工厂去打听，你猜这一打听怎么样呀？”
    “有没有？”老安头瞪着眼问。
    “有。有的是，”赵旺不再故意的使老安头着急了，“很多厂子都在扩建，缺机器，缺零件，正找铁工厂加工找不到碴呢。”
    “是真的吗？”
    “谁诳你！”
    “好了！”老安头一个鲤鱼打挺从床上翻下来，连鞋也没顾得蹬，穿着背心就往外跑，可巧，外面也慌慌张张进来一个人，两人正好撞个满怀。
    来人正是车间主任白永义。只见他捂着撞酸了的鼻子喊：“你这老家伙，为什么事先不登记呀？现在你快到厂子看看去吧，乱了营啦，不少厂子的厂长、书记全来啦。厂长要我赶快找你去。听说，他们是向咱们厂求援，做零件做机器。他们的耳朵也不知怎么这样长，怎么知道咱们没活干？可是，咱们究竟有多少敷余工时呢？除了做工厂的零件，能给厂外做多少，都能做什么？……”
    他光顾自己捂鼻盖脸地喊，老安头早跑得没影儿了。
