Disbelieving in Native Methods Is Disbelieving in the Masses
    Chen Zhiyan
    Recently, on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and in the fields of science and technology, all kinds of native methods have shown their great power. In people's minds, things that have always belonged to the foreign category, such as fertilizers, machinery, blast furnaces, oil refining, railways, hump marshalling yards, etc., can now be produced and built using native methods. Today, this newspaper also published news from Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, stating that they will promote the manufacturing of ball bearings in every county, township, and commune. This is another unique achievement. Ball bearings have always been considered to be produced only by modern industry, but now agricultural cooperatives can also manufacture them.
    Miracles happen every year, but why are there so many this year? The reason is that we have discovered that there is a kind of native method besides the foreign method. This native method originally existed objectively, but we did not pay attention to it in the past, and of course, we rarely used it. The reason for not paying attention to it is that it is considered native, and we look down on it. We don’t understand that these native methods contain a large amount of the people's creative spirit and the inheritance and development of China's historical traditions. Many people only understand the role of the foreign, but do not know the power of the native, that is, they do not understand the power of the masses. The rectification movement and the new situation of the Great Leap Forward are like a key, opening people's minds, allowing people to run out of the ivory tower and discover another world—the ocean of the wisdom of the masses. "It turns out that there are all kinds of methods here." Many difficult problems have been solved, and the train of socialist construction is running faster. "First use native methods to get on the horse, and then implement mechanization!" has become as familiar as a jingle.
    No matter how obvious the situation is, no matter how clear the policy is, there are always some people whose thinking cannot keep up with the trend. A friend from the local area talked about the saying of "four beliefs and four disbeliefs" in the tide of vigorously developing local industries. The first is to believe in the foreign and not believe in the native, the second is to believe in the big and not believe in the small, the third is to believe in the rich and not believe in the poor, and the fourth is to believe in experts and not believe in the masses. Analyzing these "four beliefs and four disbeliefs" from the perspective of methodology, it is just "one belief and one disbelief," that is, believing in the subjective and not believing in the actual, believing in metaphysics and not believing in dialectics. From the content point of view, the key to the four beliefs and four disbeliefs lies in believing in the foreign and not believing in the native. Big and small are not entirely the same issue as foreign and native, but in some people's minds, big means foreign, and small means native. More money means it can be foreign, and less money must be native. Experts must be foreign, and the masses must be native, so they all disbelieve in the native. It seems that the dispute between native and foreign is still a contradiction that has not been completely resolved in the current Great Leap Forward.
      Among the people who do not believe in the native, their mental state is not completely the same, and it needs to be analyzed and distinguished.
    There is a kind of person, that is, some bourgeois experts, who have not yet jumped out of the mire of outdated capitalist ideas, or have just climbed out of the upper half of their body, and the lower half of their body has not yet climbed out, or are trying to jump out, but have not yet jumped. These people naturally think that everything (including the moon) is better in foreign countries, and everything is better in foreign countries. All native things—all creations of the people—are not worth a glance. In the field of technical science, they are all illegal. This kind of person looks very proud, but is actually a pitiful slave. There are not many of these people, and some of them also want to get rid of this slave state, but this is a revolution in thought, and of course, revolution is not so easy. It requires struggle, constant self-struggle. For them, the dispute between native and foreign also reflects the struggle between two kinds of thoughts: capitalism and socialism.
    There is also a kind of person who does not like the native very much. However, they do not think that everything foreign is good. For example, they do not like capitalism, nor do they like the American way of life. They just think that native methods are backward. They feel that socialism can only be built on the basis of modern large-scale industry, and native methods and small enterprises are always not ideal. It can be seen that although this kind of person believes in the foreign and not in the native, their heart is good.
    If we only interpret the foreign as modern, advanced technology and high productivity, and therefore believe in the foreign, then there is nothing wrong with that. One of the outlines of our technological revolution is to adopt and learn the latest technological achievements in the world as much as possible, and realize national industrialization, labor mechanization, and urban and rural electrification. In other words, we must have everything foreign in the world, and we must know how to do everything foreign. Not only that, we will become the most foreign country in the world in the future—a country with highly developed productivity, which all capitalist foreign countries will be out of reach. Our point of divergence lies in how to be foreign. Is it proceeding from reality or from subjectivity? You want to be foreign, and you also want to turn us into a country with an annual output of tens of millions of tons of steel. This wish is of course very good, but you only like large blast furnaces with a volume of 1,513 cubic meters like Baogang and large open-hearth steelmaking furnaces of 500 tons. As for small blast furnaces of several cubic meters and small hand-cranked steelmaking converters, you always feel that they are too shabby and indecent. What is the result? Only wanting the foreign, only wanting the big, the speed can only be "slowly come," the foreign plus the native, the small, is like riding on a thousand-mile horse. Why can our iron increase by 20 million tons and our steel increase by 10 million tons in the next year? The secret lies in mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop native blast furnaces and small converters.
    Perhaps you think that we regard native methods as sacred and ultimately unchanged, but that is not the case. Things are always going to develop and change. We advocate the combination of native and foreign, and currently we must focus on the native, but we also advocate that the native should produce the foreign and change from small to large, because modern large-scale industry is still the material basis of socialism.
    Then, you may think that we regard all native methods as backward. That's not the case either. Native methods are generally smaller in productivity and technically more backward, but not all native methods are necessarily backward. For example, Li Shimei's treatment of termites is better than any foreign method. The so-called native methods are nothing more than the creations of the people in past and present in production practice. And science comes from practice. Although some creations have not yet undergone systematic theoretical summarization, it cannot be said that they are backward. Therefore, some so-called native methods are not only necessary today, but also necessary in the future, and must be carried forward.
    The latter kind of people, believing in the foreign and not believing in the native, fundamentally believe in the subjective and not in the actual. The dispute between native and foreign mainly reflects the dispute between subjectivism-dogmatism and dialectical materialism. Not believing in native methods means not believing in the creativity of the masses and not respecting historical practice. Since you don't believe in the masses and don't respect history, then you are a little forgetful, and forgetting your roots means denying your existence. Isn't this very logical?

    不信土法也就是不信群众
    陈之衍
    最近，在工农业战线上，在科学技术的领域中，各式各样的土办法大显威风。在人们的心目中，历来属于洋的范畴的如化肥、机械、高炉、炼油、铁路、驼峰调车场等等，原来都可以用土办法来生产、建造。今天本报又发表了安徽阜阳专区，要在县县、乡乡、社社推广制造滚珠轴承的消息，这又是独出一家。滚珠轴承从来也是被认为只能是现代工业生产的，可是现在农业社也能制造了。
    奇迹年年有，为何今年多？原因就是发现了洋办法以外还有一种土办法。这种土办法本来是客观存在，可是我们过去没有注意它，当然就很少利用它。没有注意的原因，就是因为它土，看不起它。不懂得这些土办法中，包含着大量的人民群众的独创精神，包含着我国历史传统的继承和发扬。许多人只了解洋的作用，而不知道土的威力，也就是不懂得群众的威力。整风运动和大跃进的新形势，像一把钥匙，打开了人们的脑筋，使人们从象牙之塔里跑出来，发现了另外一个天地——群众的智慧的海洋。“原来这里什么办法都有”，许许多多难题解决了，社会主义建设的列车跑得更快了。“先用土法跨上马，再来实行机械化！”已经像顺口溜一样被人们所熟悉。
    不管形势多么明显，不管方针多么清楚，总还有些人的思想跟不上潮流。有朋友自地方来，谈到在大办地方工业的浪潮中有“四信四不信”之说。一曰信洋不信土，二曰信大不信小，三曰信富不信穷，四曰信专家不信群众，从思想方法上分析这“四信四不信”，只是“一信一不信”而已，这就是信主观不信实际、信形而上学不信辩证法。从内容上看，四信四不信，关键在于信洋不信土。大和小同洋和土不
  完全是一个问题，但在有些人的脑筋中，大则洋，小则土。钱
  多则可洋，钱少一定土。专家必洋，群众必土，因此都不信
  土。看起来，土洋之争，还是当前大跃进中一个没有完全解决
  的矛盾。
      在不信土的人们中间，其精神状态也还不是完全一致的，
  需要加以分析和区别。
    有一种人，这就是一些资产阶级的专家们，他们迄今还没有
  跳出陈腐的资本主义思想的泥坑，或者刚爬出上半个身子，下半个身子还没有爬出来，或者正想往外跳，但是还没有跳。这些人，自然认为一切（包括月亮在内）都是外国的好，都是洋的好。一切土的——一切人民群众的创造都是不值一瞥的。在技术科学的领域内都是非法的。这种人看起来很骄傲，实际上是可怜的奴隶主义者。这种人为数不多，他们中间有些人也很想摆脱这种奴隶状态，然而这是一种思想上的革命，革命当然就不那么容易。需要斗争，不断地进行自我斗争。对于他们来说，土洋之争也是反映了资本主义和社会主义两种思想的斗争。
    还有一种人，他们也不大喜欢土。不过他们到不是认为外国的一切都好。比如，他们就不喜欢资本主义，也不喜欢美国生活方式。他们只是嫌土办法落后。他们觉得社会主义只能建立在现代化的大工业的基础上，土办法、小企业总是不够理想。可见得这种人虽然信洋不信土，然而心是好的。
    如果把洋仅仅解释为现代的、先进的技术和高度的生产力，因而信洋，那末这并没有什么不对。我们的技术革命的纲领之一，就是要尽可能地采用和学习世界上一切最新的技术成就，实现全国工业化、劳动机械化、城乡电气化。换句话说，世界上一切洋的东西，洋的办法，我们都要有，都要会。不仅如此，我们将来还要成为世界上最洋的国家——生产力高度发展的国家，一切资本主义的洋国都将望尘莫及。我们的分歧点在于如何洋法。是从实际出发，还是从主观出发。你想洋，你也想把我们变成一个年产几千万吨钢铁的国家。这个愿望当然很好，可是你只喜欢像包钢那样的容积一千五百一十三立方公尺的炼铁大高炉和五百吨的炼钢大平炉，至于几个立方公尺的小高炉和那种手摇的炼钢小转炉，你总觉得太寒伧、太不体面。结果怎样呢？光要洋的，光要大的，速度只能是“慢慢来”，洋的加土的、小的，就像骑上了千里马。为什么在今后一年内我们的铁能猛增两千万吨、钢能猛增一千万吨？妙诀就在于发动群众大办土高炉、小转炉。
    也许你以为我们把土办法看成是神圣的，终极不变的了，那也不然。事物总是要发展要变化的。我们主张土洋结合，当前更要以土为主，但我们也主张土中出洋、由小变大，因为现代化的大工业仍然是社会主义的物质基础。
    那末，你也许认为我们把一切土办法都看成是落后的了。这也不然。土办法，一般地说是生产力小一些，技术上落后一些，但并不是所有的土办法都一定落后。比如李始美治白蚁，比什么洋办法都好。所谓土办法，不外是过去的和现在的人民群众在生产实践中的创造。而科学就是从实践中来的。有些创造虽然还没有经过系统的理论上的总结，但是并不能说那就是落后的。因此有一些所谓土办法，不仅今天是必需的，而且将来也是必需的，要发扬光大的。
    后一种人，信洋不信土，从根本上说是信主观不信实际，土洋之争，在这里主要反映为主观主义—教条主义和辩证唯物主义之争。不相信土办法，也就是不相信群众的创造力，不尊重历史的实践。既然不相信群众又不尊重历史，这就未免有点忘本了，而忘本也就是否认自己的存在，难道这不是很合乎逻辑的吗？
