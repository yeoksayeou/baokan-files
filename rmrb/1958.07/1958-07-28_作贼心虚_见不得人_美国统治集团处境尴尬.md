Guilty Conscience, Can't Bear the Light of Day
The Embarrassing Situation of the American Ruling Clique
Forced to Accept Summit Conference

    This newspaper reports that America, with a guilty conscience, is extremely afraid of holding a summit conference, yet is unable to refuse. The reports from foreign news agencies and newspapers in recent days fully reflect this helpless situation of the American ruling clique. The Egyptian "Al-Ahram" said on the 26th: "If the United States has a clear conscience on the Middle East issue, it would agree to hold a top-level meeting without hesitation." But in fact, the opposite is true.

    As early as the 23rd, Kyodo News Agency of Japan sent a telegram from Washington saying: "Premier Khrushchev is prepared to participate in the summit conference proposed by the United States and Britain in the United Nations Security Council, on the condition that he invite Indian Prime Minister Nehru and representatives of Arab countries. This news seems to have caused considerable confusion and wavering among President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and the leaders of the U.S. government." "It is believed that it is very difficult for the U.S. government to reject Premier Khrushchev's proposal. U.S. Congressional figures and diplomatic experts believe that the United States may eventually accept." Otherwise, "there is a danger that it will create extremely unfavorable results such as a split within the United States and the Western camp." "However, it should be recognized that the fact that the summit will be held within the United Nations is a major victory for Khrushchev's diplomacy."

    British newspapers also fully reflect the very passive situation of the United States on the issue of participating in the summit conference. The British "Daily Mail" published a diary from New York by Eden on July 25, writing: "President Eisenhower reluctantly, unwillingly, and very hesitantly goes to attend what is called the most ominous international conference in history, because the United States has no other choice now." This diary quoted Lippmann's commentary in the American newspaper, saying: "The top-level meeting held in the heart of New York City has a certain nightmare quality, in which people feel they have to do things they are very unwilling to do." "The New York Times" wrote: "The U.S. government is being pushed and pulled, and thus reluctantly takes this step toward the top-level meeting. This push is centrifugal, and is the pressure exerted by the British Labour Party on Prime Minister Macmillan. This pressure is also world opinion exerting from the outside." "The Wall Street Journal" said: "The fact is, no matter what we may become, we are no longer the masters of our own foreign policy at the moment."

Escaping the Guilt of Aggressors is Impossible

    "New York Daily News" said on the 25th: "Mr. Khrushchev... with the assistance of British Prime Minister Macmillan, frightened the United States into agreeing to hold a top-level meeting to discuss the Middle East issue, against President Eisenhower's better judgment...

    "It can be asserted that Khrushchev will use this world stage" to portray himself as "the greatest peace-loving man in history, while the United States is the most despicable aggressor in history."

    "New York Daily News" indeed spoke of the fundamental reason why the United States is afraid of participating in the summit conference. However, is the United States' blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and blatant aggression in the Middle East merely someone's propaganda? The "Washington Post," in an article entitled "French Unease About U.S. Action in Lebanon" by Childs from Paris on July 22, wrote:

    "In the eyes of the French, the landing of the Marines throughout the Arab world will be seen as another act by white colonial powers attempting to impose their will on the Middle East.

    "Officials here strongly believe that the U.S. landing has gained little or nothing, and the approach it has taken is somewhat absurd, making the U.S. and the West look foolish in the eyes of the Arabs. Only a quick withdrawal of the Marines can eliminate the consequences of this action."

    This is the view of officials from the United States' allies. The United States cannot wash away the guilt of aggressors in the face of the people of the world. Even the American "Time Magazine," in summarizing the world's reactions to the U.S. invasion of Lebanon, could not but admit that it was met with "suspicion, fear, unease, and condemnation." And after holding a summit conference has become an inevitable fact, the American ruling clique has fallen into inextricable troubles.

Guilty Conscience and Fear of Meetings

    Senator Mansfield, one of the Democratic leaders in the U.S. Senate, gave a speech in the Senate on the 26th, sharply attacking the government's reluctance to hold a top-level meeting, saying: "We do not need to be afraid of meeting with Mr. Khrushchev, Mr. Nasser, or any other world leader." However, he could not hide the guilty conscience of the United States participating in the summit conference, fearing condemnation. He asked: "Have we done naughty things in the Middle East, so that we must concentrate our efforts on not being violently attacked by world opinion, or at least reduce the pain of being beaten to a minimum?" Here, Mansfield makes things too light. What the United States has done in the Middle East is not just naughty things, but naked acts of aggression. Guilty conscience and fear of the light of day, therefore, Mansfield said, "If when attending the meeting, one eye is on the door and one hand is grabbing the shirt, just waiting for the opportunity to escape... it is better to stay at home." However, the pressure of world opinion will not let them stay at home, what to do?

    The London "Times" published an article by the newspaper's reporter on July 24 entitled "Doubts in Washington," saying, "According to the views of the President's entourage, it is unlikely that he will not go. But at present, this statement is spreading: if the Russians attempt to turn this meeting into a propaganda platform, Eisenhower will leave the meeting." This may be the time for Mansfield's so-called "escape." However, some other American newspapers are busy cheering up the government and offering suggestions to sabotage.

    The "New York Times" said on the 25th, commenting on the proposed top-level meeting to discuss the Middle East issue, "The important thing is whether we will make full use of this opportunity and play our role in it energetically and skillfully. Giving the impression that we are uneasy about the outcome of the meeting (some people in Washington have indeed given this impression) is an ominous sign for the meeting. It reveals the view that American diplomats are no match for the Russians, and our reasoning is insufficient..."

    "The Washington Post" said: "We should not just rely on our own motives for scolding the Soviet Union to eliminate misunderstandings. On the contrary, we will have to explain our intentions."

    The Washington dispatch published in "The Wall Street Journal" on the 25th wrote: "The United States emphasizes the need for pre-meeting preparations to delay time. Officials are also trying to dissuade Khrushchev from coming to New York." In other words, Washington has clearly not given up its plan to sabotage the summit conference. It even wants to use the following methods to "intimidate" the Soviet government: that this meeting will be used as a platform for anti-Soviet propaganda, and the newspapers are also clamoring about the possibility of anti-Soviet demonstrations in New York. "The Wall Street Journal" admits that this is also to obstruct the holding of the summit of heads of government in New York.

    The United States cannot refuse to participate in the summit conference, and is very afraid of attending this meeting. This is the embarrassing situation in which the United States is currently in on this issue.

### 作贼心虚  见不得人  美国统治集团处境尴尬

    作贼心虚  见不得人
    美国统治集团处境尴尬
    被迫接受首脑会议
    本报讯　美国作贼心虚，十分害怕举行首脑会议，而又无法拒绝。从这几天外国通讯社和报刊的报道中，充分反映出了美国统治集团的这种无可奈何的处境。埃及“金字塔报”26日说：“如果美国在中东问题上，问心无愧的话，那它会毫不犹豫地同意举行最高级会议”。可是事实上正相反。
    日本共同社早在23日从华盛顿发出的电讯中就说：“赫鲁晓夫总理以邀请印度的尼赫鲁总理和阿拉伯国家代表为条件，准备参加美英两国建议在联合国安全理事会举行的首脑会议，这个消息似乎使艾森豪威尔总统、杜勒斯国务卿以及美国政府的领袖们产生了相当大的混乱和动摇。”“人们认为，美国政府要拒绝赫鲁晓夫总理的这个建议，是非常困难的。美国国会人士和外交专家认为，美国最后可能会接纳”。否则，“就有这样的危险：将会造成在美国和西方阵营内发生分裂那样极为不利的结果。”“但是，应该认识，首脑会谈就要在联合国内举行这件事情，是赫鲁晓夫外交的一次大胜利。”
    英国报纸也充分反映出了美国在参加首脑会议问题上的处境十分被动。英国“每日邮报”7月25日刊登了伊当从纽约发回的日记，写道：“艾森豪威尔总统勉强地、不情愿地、十分踌躇地去参加这里所称的历史上最不祥的一次国际会议，因为美国现在没有其他办法。”在这篇日记中，引了美国报纸上李普曼的评论说：“在纽约市中心举行的最高级会议具有某种恶梦的特点，在这种恶梦中，人们觉得不得不作他们非常不愿作的事情。”“纽约时报”克罗克写道：“美国政府受到推力和拉力，因而勉强采取这个走向最高级会议的步骤。这种推力是离心的，是由英国工党对麦克米伦首相施加的压力。这种压力也是世界舆论从外部施加的。”“华尔街日报”说：“事实是，不管我们可能变成怎样的人，我们目前已经不再是我们自己的外交政策的主人了。”
    逃不脱侵略者的罪责
    25日“纽约每日新闻”说：“赫鲁晓夫先生……在英国首相麦克米伦协助下，违反艾森豪威尔总统的较为高明的判断，把美国吓唬得同意了举行最高级会议讨论中东问题……
    “可以断定赫鲁晓夫将利用这个世界讲台”，把自己说成是“历史上最伟大的爱好和平的人，而美国则是历史上最卑鄙的侵略者。”
    “纽约每日新闻”的确说出了美国所以害怕参加首脑会议的根本原因。然而，美国这一次公然违犯联合国宪章，公然侵略中东，岂是那一个人的宣传吗？“华盛顿邮报”就在7月22日刊登的蔡尔兹从巴黎发出的一篇题为“法国人对于美国在黎巴嫩的行动感到不安”的文章中写道：
  “在法国人看来，在阿拉伯世界各地，海军陆战队的登陆将被认为是白色殖民国家企图把它们的意志强加在中东头上的另一个行动。
    “这里负责官员们强烈地认为，美国登陆收获很少，或者没有收获，它所采取的办法稍嫌荒唐，使美国和西方国家在阿拉伯人眼中显得愚蠢。只有尽快撤走海军陆战队才能消除这个行动所产生的后果。”
    这是来自美国的盟国的官员的看法。美国在全世界人民面前，已经无法洗脱侵略者的罪名。连美国的“时代周刊”在归纳世界各地对美军侵黎的反应时，也不能不承认是遭到了“怀疑、恐惧、不安和谴责”。而在举行首脑会议已经成为不可避免的事实之后，美国统治集团已陷在无法解脱的烦恼中。
    理亏心虚害怕开会
    美国参议院民主党领袖之一曼斯菲尔德26日在参议院发表演说，尖锐地攻击了政府不情愿举行最高级会议，他说：“我们不必害怕同赫鲁晓夫先生、纳赛尔先生或其他任何世界领袖碰头。”然而，他也无法掩饰美国参加首脑会议那种怕受谴责的犯罪心情，他问道：“难道我们在中东干了淘气的事情，因而我们必须集中力量不受世界舆论的猛烈抨击，或者是至少把挨打的痛苦减轻到最低限度吗？”在这里，曼斯菲尔德把事情说得过分轻松了。美国在中东干的，岂止是什么淘气的事情，而是赤裸裸的侵略罪行。理亏心虚，见不得人，因而，曼斯菲尔德说，“如果在出席会议的时候，一只眼睛瞅着门，一只手抓着衬衫，只等时机到来就逃跑……，倒不如呆在家里。”可是，世界舆论的压力，又不能让他们呆在家里，如何是好呢？
    7月24日伦敦“泰晤士报”刊登了该报记者一篇题为“华盛顿的疑虑”的文章说，“按照总统侍从们的看法，他很少可能不去。但是目前正在散布这种说法：如果俄国人企图将这次会谈变为宣传讲坛的话，艾森豪威尔就会退出会场”。这也许就是曼斯菲尔德所谓的“逃跑”的时机吧。不过美国的另一些报纸，却在忙着给政府打气和献计进行破坏。
    “纽约时报”25日在评论拟议中的讨论中东问题的最高级会议时说，“重要的是我们是否会充分利用这个时机，精力充沛地巧妙地在里面起我们的作用。给人以我们对会议结果感到不安的印象（华盛顿某些人士确实给了人以这种印象），这对于会议是一个不祥预兆。这透露出这样一种看法：美国外交家敌不过俄国人，而我们的道理是不充足的……”
    “华盛顿邮报”说：“我们不应该只凭自己痛骂苏联的动机来消除误解。相反，我们将不得不说明我们的意图。”
    “华尔街日报”25日刊载的华盛顿通讯中写道：“美国强调指出必须进行会前准备以拖延时间。官方人士也设法劝阻赫鲁晓夫来纽约。”换句话说，华盛顿显然没有最后放弃破坏高级会议的打算。甚至想用下列办法来“恫吓”苏联政府：即这个会议将被用作进行反苏宣传的讲台，而且各报还围绕着在纽约可能举行反苏示威一事大肆叫嚷。“华尔街日报”承认，这也是为了阻挠在纽约举行政府首脑会议的。
    美国无法拒绝参加首脑会议，而又十分害怕出席这个会议，这就是目前美国在这个问题上所处的尴尬局面。
