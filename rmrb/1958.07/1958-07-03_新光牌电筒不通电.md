    "Xin Guang" Brand Flashlight Not Working
    In mid-April, I bought a "Xin Guang" brand flashlight produced by the Guangdong Local State-Owned Xinsheng Flashlight Factory.
    When buying it, I only managed to select one out of five or six, because the others wouldn't turn on even with batteries installed. And this flashlight that I picked out stopped working less than half a month after I bought it.
    I hope this factory will guarantee the quality of its products before they leave the factory.

    新光牌电筒不通电
    4月中旬，我在百货商店买了一个广东省地方国营新生电筒厂出品的新光牌电筒。
    买的时候，在五、六个当中，才选出了一个，其余的装上了电池以后都不能通电。而这个挑选出来的电筒买回不到半月以后也不通电了。
    我希望这个厂对产品出厂一定要保证质量。
