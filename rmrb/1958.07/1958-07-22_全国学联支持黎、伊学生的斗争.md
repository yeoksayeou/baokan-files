Xinhua News Agency, July 17th. The All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to students in Lebanon and Iraq, supporting their just struggle and congratulating them on the establishment of the Republic of Iraq.

In a telegram to Lebanese and Iraqi students, which the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council was asked to forward, the All-China Students' Federation said: "Today, all Chinese students and the people of the whole country are joyously celebrating the birth of the Republic of Iraq; at the same time, we are protesting with extreme indignation against the armed aggression of US imperialism against the Lebanese people.

"The Chinese people have suffered deeply from the aggression and oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionaries in the past, and therefore naturally hold a brotherly sympathy and resolute support for your struggle. Dear students, we resolutely stand together with the students of Iraq, Lebanon and Arab countries who have a heroic tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, strengthen unity, and fight to completely crush any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism."

    新华社17日讯  中华全国学生联合会今天致电黎巴嫩和伊拉克的学生，支持他们的正义斗争，并且祝贺伊拉克共和国的成立。
    全国学联在请亚非人民团结理事会书记处转达给黎巴嫩和伊拉克学生的一份电报中说：“今天全中国学生和全国人民在一起，热烈欢呼伊拉克共和国的诞生；同时以万分愤慨的心情抗议美国帝国主义对黎巴嫩人民的武装侵略。
      “中国人民在过去曾经饱尝帝国主义和国内反动派的侵略和压迫，因而对于你们的斗争很自然就抱着兄弟般的同情和坚决支持的态度。亲爱的同学们，我们坚决同有着英勇的反帝斗争传统的伊拉克、黎巴嫩和阿拉伯各国学生在一起，加强团结，为彻底粉碎帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋而斗争。”（附图片）
