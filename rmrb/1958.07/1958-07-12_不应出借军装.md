    From the Masses' Criticism

    Military Uniforms Should Not Be Loaned Out
    In our school, some students often wear military uniforms when taking photos, and they even enlarge these photos to five or six inches. It is said that these students' relatives or friends are military officers, and the military uniforms are borrowed from these relatives and friends.
    Military uniforms represent the identity of soldiers. Lending them casually to ordinary citizens or students for taking photos is a serious violation of military discipline. We hope that relevant departments can stop this phenomenon.

### 不应出借军装

    不应出借军装
    我们学校里有些同学在照相时，常常身着军装，而且还把这些照片放大到五、六吋。据说，这些同学的亲戚或朋友都是军官，军装就是从这些亲戚朋友那里借来的。
    军服是代表军人的身份的，随便借给一个普通的公民或学生照相，这是严重违犯军纪的行为，希望有关方面能够制止这种现象。
