    Comparing fragrance in the garden of a hundred flowers.
    "Comparing fragrance in the garden of a hundred flowers, selecting the best among the good people," "This year is a great leap in production, we must elect the promoters, not the regressors." This is the standard proposed by everyone in the national grassroots elections for identifying representative candidates. As a result, a large number of promoters were elected as people's representatives.
    There are many colors of flowers in the garden of a hundred flowers, some fragrant and some foul, but promoters are the most fragrant flowers in the garden. Their election as people's representatives precisely shows that the masses are "wise in recognizing heroes."
    The most reliable guarantee for building socialism is people—people who are full of energy and strive for the top, people who are most determined to take the socialist road. With such people, our socialist construction can be done more, faster, better, and more economically. And promoters are such people. It is conceivable how great a role their election as people's representatives will play in promoting and accelerating our socialist construction!
    At the same time, I think the result of comparing fragrance should also have some educational effect on the regressors. Because of quota restrictions, it is necessary to select the best from the good, and not all promoters can be elected as people's representatives; but it is not surprising that regressors are not elected, because in the eyes of the masses, they are an unfragrant flower. Their ideas of settling for the lower reaches and their various strange arguments are unwelcome and have no market. They are compared down!
    Therefore, whether to be full of energy, strive for the top, be a fragrant flower in the garden of a hundred flowers, and move forward with the pace of the times, or to be listless and unenterprising and be a lagger of the times, this is a major issue currently facing the regressors.

    百花园中比花香

    “百花园中比花香，好人当中选好人”，“今年是生产大跃进，要选促进派，不选促退派”，这是全国基层选举中大家提出的鉴别代表候选人的标准，结果大批促进派当选人民代表。
    百花园中花色不少，有香有臭，而促进派是百花园中最香的花，他们之当选为人民代表，正说明了群众是“慧眼识英雄”的。
    建设社会主义最可靠的保证是人——是鼓足干劲，力争上游的人，是走社会主义道路最坚决的人，有了这样的人，我们的社会主义建设才能做到又多又快又好又省。而促进派正是这样的人，他们当选人民代表，可以想像得到，这对促进和加速我们的社会主义建设会起多么大的作用！
    同时，比花香的结果，我想这对促退派也该有些教育作用。因为名额限制，要好中选好，促进派不可能全都当选人民代表；但促退派之没有当选却不奇怪，因为在群众的心目中，他们是一株不香的花，他们的安居下游的思想，他们的种种奇怪论调，是不受欢迎和没有市场的，一比就比下去了！
    因此，是鼓足干劲，力争上游，作百花园中的香花，跟随时代的步伐前进呢，还是萎萎靡靡，不求上进作一个时代的落伍者，这就是目前摆在促退派面前的一个重大问题。
