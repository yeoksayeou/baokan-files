    So What About Atomic Weapons?
  　Miao Sun
    The spokesman for the U.S. invading forces in Lebanon openly clamored that the U.S. invading forces' army, navy, and air force "all have the ability to conduct atomic warfare."
    This threatening remark, aimed at intimidation, is obviously directed towards the Lebanese people and the Arab people, because for the socialist camp, which fully supports the Arab people's struggle, "atomic intimidation" has long been a laughingstock. But will the Lebanese people buy it? The Lebanese People's Army may not know what weapons the U.S. Marines possess, but they still shot down American planes that dared to intrude and arrested American soldiers who dared to trespass. Why? Because the struggle they are waging is precisely against the reactionary rule of imperialism and its agents. Atomic intimidation is also worthless in the face of the Lebanese people.
    An Associated Press reporter admitted that several explosions and shootings occurred near the U.S. invading forces' base in Beirut. "A child sent a basket of Coca-Cola bottles to the American sentries, and the basket exploded." Hatred of the invaders will generate endless strength, which no number of atomic weapons can match. Even if one person equals one weapon, Lebanon has 1.5 million people, and except for a small number of reactionary elements willing to be lackeys, all oppose the American invasion. How many atomic weapons does the United States have?

    原子武器又怎样？
  　苗隼
    侵黎美军发言人公开叫嚣说，美国侵略军陆海空部队“都有进行原子战争的能力”。
    这句目的在于恐吓的话，显然是对黎巴嫩人民以及阿拉伯人民说的，因为对全力支援阿拉伯人民斗争的社会主义阵营来说，“原子恐吓”早已成为笑柄。但是，黎巴嫩人民买不买账呢？黎巴嫩人民军未必不知道美国海军陆战队拥有些什么武器，但是还是把胆敢侵犯的美国飞机打了下来，还是把胆敢乱闯的美国兵抓了起来。为什么？因为他们所进行的斗争，正是反对帝国主义及其代理人的反动统治。原子恐吓在黎巴嫩人面前，也并不值几文钱。
    美联社记者承认在贝鲁特美侵略军驻地附近发生了好几起爆炸和射击。“一个小孩把一篮可口可乐的瓶子送给美国哨兵，这个篮子爆炸了”。对侵略者的仇恨，就会产生无穷无尽的力量，那是多少个原子武器也抵不过的。就算一个人抵一个吧，黎巴嫩有一百五十万人，除了一小撮甘心当走狗的反动分子以外，都是反对美国侵略的，美国原子武器又能有多少呢？
