Some time ago, staff in the pharmaceutical sector of the commercial departments discussed the question: Can pharmaceutical commercial work achieve a great leap forward? Where is its upstream? Many people believed that while other work could leap forward, pharmaceutical commercial work was a "cold" area and could not be boosted, even if desired. Their reasoning was: with the elimination of the four pests, improved hygiene, and fewer diseases, the need for medicine would naturally decrease. A leap forward couldn't mean forcing the masses to take more medicine! Now, thanks to Dengfeng County in Henan Province, which has established a banner for the all-round great leap forward in pharmaceutical commercial work, this issue can be clarified.

The pharmaceutical commercial workers in Dengfeng County also experienced a so-called "depressed period of difficulty in leaping forward." However, after studying, debating, and recognizing the situation, they immediately realized that the actual situation was completely opposite to their original ideas: in the great leap forward in agricultural production, the farmers' need for medicine and health was not reduced, but was more urgent than ever. They deeply felt that in order to make continuous leaps forward in production, they must ensure that people and livestock were strong, in order to improve the attendance rate of both. As a result, they saw their responsibility, regarded their work as a force to promote the great leap forward in agricultural production, and immediately threw themselves into the great struggle to change the face of rural medicine and health. As a result, because they went all out and strove for the top, rural medicine and health work had made great progress, basically achieving the requirement of "minor illnesses treated in the township, major illnesses treated in the county, people strong and livestock healthy, and a great increase in agricultural production." As for the pharmaceutical commercial work itself, not only was the problem of the direction of the leap forward solved, but the business also became larger and larger.

Commercial work must jump out of the circle of simple commodity circulation, participate in production, and organize production in order to have greater development. This point has now been clarified by many commercial workers. However, how to jump out of the circle of simple commodity circulation is still a problem to be solved. The experience of Dengfeng County points out that commercial work must be carried out around the central work of the Party, which is the correct direction. Because the central work of the Party is the mainstream of current socialist construction, it is the greatest politics; leaving the central work of the Party, carrying out business work in isolation is to be divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, divorced from politics, and making the work lose its direction. In this way, the business will certainly not be done well. From this, we can also draw a lesson: only by seeing the mainstream can we talk about striving for the top.

The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party put forward the great historical tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution to the whole Party and the people of the whole country. Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report: "In order to adapt to the needs of the technological revolution, it is necessary to carry out the cultural revolution at the same time, and develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings that serve economic construction." Here, pharmaceutical commercial workers shoulder a glorious and arduous task. The cultural revolution and the technological revolution are complementary to each other, and are aimed at greatly developing social productive forces. Improving the health of farmers and ensuring that people and livestock are strong is necessary for developing productive forces. Therefore, doing a good job in the supply of medicine is of great significance for promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. Seeing this point is seeing the mainstream, and pharmaceutical commercial work can strive for the top in this direction.

    看清主流才能力争上游
    孔桑
    前些时候，商业部门中的医药业的工作人员曾经讨论过这样一个问题：医药商业工作能不能跃进？它的上游在哪里？不少人认为，别的工作都能跃进，唯独医药商业工作是冷门，想跃进也跃不起来。他们的理由是：除四害、讲卫生、疾病减少了，医药需要量当然随之减少。跃进，总不能强迫群众多吃药呀！现在，由于河南省登封县树立了医药商业工作全面跃进的旗帜，这个问题可以澄清了。
    登封县的医药商业工作者也曾经有过一段所谓“难跃进的苦闷时期”，可是，当他们经过学习辩论、认清形势以后，立即发现实际情况与他们原来的想法完全相反：在农业生产大跃进中，农民对于医药卫生的需要不是减少，而是比任何时候都更为迫切，他们深切地感到，要使生产不断跃进，必须保证人强马壮，以提高人畜的出勤率。这样一来，他们就看到了自己的责任，把自己的工作看做是推动农业生产大跃进的一种力量，马上投身到改变农村医药卫生面貌的伟大斗争中去。结果，因为他们鼓足干劲，力争上游，使农村的医药卫生工作有了很大的发展，基本达到了“小病不出乡，大病不出县，人强马又壮，农业大增产”的要求。而医药商业工作本身，不仅跃进方向的问题解决了，买卖也越做越大了。
    商业工作必须跳出单纯商品流通的圈子，参与生产、组织生产，才会有更大的发展。这一点，现在已为许多商业工作者明确了。但是，怎样才能跳出单纯商品流通的圈子，则还是一个尚待解决的问题。登封县的经验指明了商业工作必须围绕党的中心工作进行，这是一个正确的方向。因为党的中心工作就是当前社会主义建设的主流，就是最大的政治；离开了党的中心工作，孤立地去进行业务工作，那就是脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离政治，使工作迷失方向，这样，业务当然搞不好。从这里也可以得出一条经验：任何工作只有看清主流，才谈得到力争上游。
    党的“八大”二次会议向全党和全国人民提出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大的历史任务，少奇同志在报告中指出：“为了适应技术革命的需要，必须同时进行文化革命，发展为经济建设服务的文化教育卫生事业。”在这里，医药商业工作者肩负着光荣而艰巨的任务。文化革命和技术革命是相辅而行的，是为了极大地发展社会生产力。提高农民的健康水平，保证人强马壮，是发展生产力所必需的。因此，做好医药的供应工作，对于推动工农业生产的发展，都有十分重要的意义。看清了这一点，就是看到了主流，医药商业工作就能够沿着这个方向去力争上游了。
