British Troops, Get Out of Jordan!
Chen Tao

The revolution in Iraq threw the imperialists into a panic, and they couldn't even bother to dress up, exposing their cannibalistic faces nakedly. American aggressor troops had barely climbed onto the beaches of Lebanon when British troops began invading Jordan on the morning of July 17th. Just hours before this, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd was still making wild accusations in the British House of Commons, slandering Iraq with some kind of "conspiracy against Jordan"; even after British troops began invading Jordan, British official spokesmen were still shamelessly covering up the truth, claiming that news of British troops landing in Jordan was "completely untrue." This is truly a vivid picture, depicting the ugly face of the aggressors and their awkward, guilty conscience!

"I am a jackal, and I want to eat people," this is the face that Britain is showing to the people of Jordan, the people of the Middle East, and the people of the whole world. But the era of "the powerful have knives and I have a neck," meekly submitting to being eaten, is long gone. The Suez Canal incident in 1956 was a clear proof of this; the aggressors were dealt a heavy blow, and they seemed to have learned a lesson. But it seems they haven't. This loser at the hands of the Arab people, the sworn enemy of the Jordanian people, British imperialism, still wants to make a comeback. This plan is bound to fail, just like the war of aggression against Korea and the war of aggression against Egypt. The people of Jordan, the people of the Middle East, and the people of the whole world are all Wu Songs who can fight tigers. As long as everyone unites and resists aggression, they can send them all to the grave!

British Labour Party leader, and supporter of British imperialist interests, Gaitskell warned: "If we try to force our will on Middle Eastern countries by force, ... then I can only say - God help us all." If there is a God, I don't think God can help those who bring evil upon themselves. The best way to "help" is to honestly get out of Jordan!

    英军滚出约旦去！
    陈涛
    伊拉克的革命使帝国主义惊惶失措，他们竟顾不得打扮，赤裸裸地摆出一副吃人的面孔。美国侵略军才爬上黎巴嫩的海滩，英国军队在7月17日清晨就开始闯入约旦。而在这几小时以前，英国外交大臣劳埃德还在英国下院大肆诬蔑伊拉克有什么“反对约旦的阴谋”；在英军开始侵入约旦以后，英国官方发言人还在厚颜无耻地遮掩，说什么英国部队正在约旦着陆的消息是“完全不真实的”。这真是一幅生动的图画，把侵略者的丑恶嘴脸和他们的尴尬、心虚的境地描绘出来了！
    “我就是豺狼，我就是要吃人”，这就是英国摆在约旦人民面前，中东人民面前和全世界人民面前的一副嘴脸。可是“大人有刀我有头”、伸着颈项服服贴贴让吃的时代已经一去不复返了，1956年苏伊士运河事件就是一个明证，侵略者挨了重重的一棒，他们似乎应该得到教训。然而看来他们并没有。这个阿拉伯人民手下的败将，约旦人民的世仇的英帝国主义者，还想卷土重来，这个打算肯定是要失败的，正如侵朝战争和侵埃战争一样。约旦人民、中东人民和全世界人民都是打虎的武松，只要大家团结一心，反抗侵略，就能把它们一起送进坟墓！
    英国工党领袖，英帝国主义利益的支持者盖茨克尔警告说：“如果我们试图用武力强迫中东国家接受我们的意志，……那么我只能说——上帝保佑我们大家吧。”假如有上帝的话，对自作孽的人，我看上帝也是保佑不了的，最好的“保佑”办法是老老实实地滚出约旦去！
