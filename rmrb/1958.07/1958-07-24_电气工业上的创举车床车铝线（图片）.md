Electrical Industry Innovation: Lathe Turning Aluminum Wire

    After more than a month of hard work, intensive research, and countless experiments, the technical personnel and veteran workers of the 53rd Factory successfully manufactured generator coils using aluminum wire instead of copper wire. They also invented a method of using ordinary lathes to turn aluminum wire. Replacing copper wire with aluminum wire is a major revolutionary innovation in China's electrical industry. Turning aluminum wire on a lathe is a great original achievement never before seen in the scientific and technological fields of any country. The successful experiment of replacing copper wire with aluminum wire in motors can not only save the country a large amount of copper and alleviate the tight copper supply situation, but also because the temperature rise of aluminum wire is lower than that of copper wire, the service life of each aluminum wire motor can be 30 to 40 years longer than that of copper wire motors, and the cost is greatly reduced. Based on the factory's annual output of 23,000 units alone, it can save the country more than 10,000 yuan a year. Left picture: Aluminum wire turned out by ordinary lathes and cutting tools.

    电气工业上的创举车床车铝线
    五三工厂技术人员与老工人经过一个多月的苦干猛钻和无数次的试验，用铝线代替铜线制造发电机线圈成功；并且创造了用一般车床车制铝线的方法。铝线代替铜线是我国电气工业中的一项重大的革命创举；而用车床车出铝线，则是世界各国科学技术领域里从来没有过的一项伟大的独创。 铝线代替电机铜线的试验成功，不仅可以给国家节约大量的铜，缓和铜的供应紧张的局面，而且由于铝线的温升比铜线低，每台铝线电机可比铜线电机的使用寿命多三十年到四十年，成本也大大降低。仅该厂年产两万三千台计算，一年可为国家节约一万多元。左图：用普通车床和车刀车出来的铝线。右图：车工李云超（左）和技术员韩长荣（右）正用普通的车床和弧形钻孔的车刀，车制铝线。　姜鸣摄（新华社稿）
