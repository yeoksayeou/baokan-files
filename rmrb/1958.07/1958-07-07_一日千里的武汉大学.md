    The Leaping and Bounding Wuhan University

    On the beautifully scenic Luojia Mountain in Wuchang, stand row upon row of tall buildings, and this is the renowned comprehensive university – Wuhan University.

    This university has been established for thirty years now, and is one of the earliest institutions of higher learning established in our country. Before liberation, this school constantly suffered from the devastation of reactionary rulers. In 1947, the "June 1st" bloody incident occurred at this school. Only after liberation in 1949 did Wuhan University truly embark on becoming a university that cultivates advanced construction talents for the new China.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the teachers and students of Wuhan University have actively participated in various political movements and ideological remolding movements, cultivating a large number of scientific research workers and educators for the country. Especially after the rectification movement of the past year, Wuhan University, having repelled the bourgeois right-wing's attack and deeply carried out educational reform, is leaping forward with each passing day.

    In recent years, Wuhan University has developed greatly under the attention and care of the Party and the People's Government. It now has eleven departments, including philosophy, Chinese language and literature, Russian language and literature, history, library science, economics, law, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, offering twelve majors such as philosophy, Chinese language and literature, Russian language, history, library science, political economy, chemistry, zoology, and botany. The university currently has 3,157 students, 461 teachers, and 44 teaching and research groups. The number of students who have graduated from this university in recent years has already exceeded the total number of graduates in the twenty years before liberation. The teaching equipment of this university is also becoming more substantial year by year. The library alone has more than 643,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books and more than 3,000 kinds of Chinese and foreign periodicals and newspapers. The school has about forty kinds of laboratories, with more than 50,000 pieces of various teaching instruments and specimens, as well as a large biology building, with more than 30,000 plant specimens from all over the country.

    一日千里的武汉大学
    在风景美丽的武昌珞珈山上，耸立着一幢一幢的高大楼房，这就是著名的综合大学——武汉大学。
    这所大学成立到现在已经有三十年了，是我国设立最早的高等学校之一。这所学校在解放前不断地遭受反动统治者们的摧残。1947年在这个学校里就曾发生过“六一”血案。1949年解放以后，武汉大学才开始真正走上了为新中国培养高等建设人才的大学。
    几年来，武汉大学在党的领导下，全校师生积极地参加各项政治运动和思想改造运动，为国家培养出大批科学研究工作者和教育工作者。特别是经过一年来的整风运动，武汉大学击退了资产阶级右派进攻、深入开展教学改革以后，正在一日千里的飞跃前进。
    几年来武汉大学在党和人民政府的重视和关怀下，已有了很大发展，现在有哲学、中国语言文学、俄罗斯语言文学、历史、图书馆学、经济、法律、数学、物理、化学和生物等十一个系，开设了哲学、汉语言文学、俄罗斯语言、历史、图书馆学、政治经济学、化学、动物和植物等十二个专业。全校现有学生三千一百五十七人，教师四百六十一人，有四十四个教研组。几年来从这个大学毕业的学生，已经超过了解放前二十年间的毕业生的总数。这个大学的教学设备也在一年比一年的充实，仅图书馆就拥有中、外文图书六十四万三千余册，中、外文期刊、报纸三千余种；全校的实验室约有四十类，有各种教学仪器、标本等五万余件，还有一所生物大楼，来自全国各地的植物标本就有三万多件。　（殷平）
