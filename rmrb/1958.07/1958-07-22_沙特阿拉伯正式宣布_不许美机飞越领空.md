Xinhua News Agency, July 20th, Riyadh dispatch: Saudi Arabian Prime Minister Faisal issued a public statement in Riyadh on the 19th, announcing that the Saudi Arabian government has refused to allow American planes carrying gasoline from Bahrain to Jordan to fly over Saudi Arabian airspace.

Faisal said that this decision demonstrates Saudi Arabia's attitude towards the current Middle East situation.

Faisal said that under the current circumstances, allowing American aircraft to transit would have a significant political impact. People might conclude that the Saudi King is allowing the US and Britain to strengthen their intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and that Saudi Arabia is siding with the West in the current crisis.

    沙特阿拉伯正式宣布
    不许美机飞越领空
    新华社20日讯  利雅得消息：沙特阿拉伯首相费萨尔19日在利雅得发表一项公报宣布，沙特阿拉伯政府已经拒绝让从巴林运汽油到约旦的美国飞机飞越沙特阿拉伯领空。
    费萨尔说，这个决定表明了沙特阿拉伯对目前中东事件的态度。
    费萨尔说，在目前情况下，如果容许美国飞机过境，就会产生重大的政治影响，人们可能得出结论，认为沙特国王容许美英加强对黎巴嫩和约旦的干涉，而在目前的危机中站在西方一边。
