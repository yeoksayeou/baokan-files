Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 10th: The French Socialist Party Executive Committee last night, in the absence of the party's General Secretary and Minister of State in the de Gaulle government, Mollet, passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the military riot group "Committee of Public Safety" and denouncing the de Gaulle-engineered referendum plot.

The resolution regarding the "Committee of Public Safety" condemned "irresponsible organizations" for "continuing to replace legitimate authorities" in Algeria and Corsica. It demanded the dissolution of the "Committees of Public Safety" in these two locations in order to restore the "rule of law."

The resolution regarding the referendum demanded that when the referendum is held in October, citizens should be able to express their opinions separately on two issues: whether they approve of amending the constitution and whether they approve of the de Gaulle government's new draft constitution, rather than simply voting on the new draft constitution. The resolution argued that it would be best to present several new draft constitutions for the nation to choose from.

The attitude of the Socialist Party Executive Committee has alarmed right-wing elements within the party, led by Mollet. Upon hearing that this resolution, which deviated from the path he had planned, had been passed, Mollet immediately rushed to the Socialist Party Executive Committee headquarters, even skipping the cabinet meeting.

It is believed that the above "rebellious" action reflects the growing strength within the Socialist Party of the forces opposing the right-wing group's alliance with de Gaulle.

    法社会党执委会在摩勒缺席下通过决议
    要求解散军事暴乱集团
    据新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：法国社会党执行委员会昨天晚上在党的总书记和戴高乐政府的国务部长摩勒缺席下，通过了要求解散军事暴乱集团的“救国委员会”和针对着戴高乐策划的公民投票阴谋的决议。
    关于“救国委员会”的决议谴责“不负责任的组织”在阿尔及利亚和科西嘉“继续自行代替合法的权力机构”。它要求解散这两个地方的“救国委员会”，以便恢复“法制”。
    关于公民投票的决议要求：在10月举行公民投票时，使公民能够就是否赞成修改宪法和是否赞成戴高乐政府的新宪法草案这两个问题，分别表示意见，而不是只让公民就这个新宪法草案进行表决。决议主张，最好是提出几个新宪法草案来让全国选择。
    社会党执行委员会的这种态度使得以摩勒为首的党内右翼分子着了慌。摩勒一听到这种逸出他所规划的轨道的决议获得通过，就连内阁会议也参加不下去，马上赶到社会党执行委员会总部去。
    人们认为，上述“反叛”行动反映了社会党内反对右翼集团同戴高乐合流的力量已经越来越强大。
