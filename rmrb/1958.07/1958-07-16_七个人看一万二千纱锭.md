Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 15th: The female fine yarn workers of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 8 boldly broke the convention of one person tending 800 spindles and created a new working method of specialized division of labor. Thirty fine spinning machines (a total of 12,000 spindles), which originally required eighteen operators to look after, now only require seven people. Labor productivity has more than doubled, creating the city's highest record for spinners' spindle attendance. The textile industry department held an on-site meeting at this factory yesterday to promote this experience.

Currently, in general textile factories, when each fine yarn worker tends 800 spindles, the cleaning, piecing, and roving changing of these spindles are all handled by the operator alone. Now, after changing to seven people tending 12,000 spindles, one person specializes in piecing, five people are responsible for changing roving and a small amount of cleaning, and one person specializes in cleaning the drafting part of the machine, such as top rollers and aprons.

At the beginning of the technical innovation movement, State-owned Cotton Mill No. 8 paid attention to improving cleaning tools to liberate the spinners from the heavy manual labor of a large amount of cleaning work, laying the groundwork for the female operators to change their labor organization and expand their spindle attendance capacity. At present, the cleaning work in this factory has basically achieved automation and mechanization. The relatively arduous work of wiping the machine belly, machine core, and machine surface in the past now has clever automated cleaning tools. These cleaning tools are all driven by the transmission equipment of the fine spinning machine itself, and the cost is not high. In the past, female workers used both hands to twist two bamboo needles to remove the waste cotton attached to the top rollers and aprons, which was very laborious. Recently, technician Rong Yongbao created an electric top roller picker, which is easy to use, labor-saving, and increases efficiency by more than eight times.

### 七个人看一万二千纱锭

    七个人看一万二千纱锭
    据新华社上海15日电　上海国棉八厂的细纱女工大胆破除一人挡八百枚纱锭的常规，创造专业分工的新工作方法，原来需要十八个挡车工看管的三十台细纱机（共一万二千枚纱锭），现在只需七个人就行了，劳动生产率提高一倍以上，创造了全市挡车工看锭最高纪录。纺织工业部门昨天在这个厂召开现场会议，推广这项经验。
    目前，一般纺织厂每个细纱工挡八百锭时，这些锭子的清洁、接头和换粗纱等工作，都是由挡车工一人包下来。现在改为七个人挡一万二千锭以后，一人专管接头，五人负责换粗纱和少量清洁工作，一人专门做皮辊、皮圈等机器牵伸部分的清洁工作。
    国棉八厂在技术革新运动开始的时候，就注意了改进清洁工具，使挡车工人从大量清洁工作的繁重手工劳动中解放出来，为这次挡车女工改变劳动组织，扩大看锭能力作好了准备。现在，这个厂的清洁工作已经基本上实现了自动化和机械化。过去比较吃重的揩车肚、车心和车面等工作，现在都有了巧妙的自动化的清洁工具。这些清洁工具都是用细纱机本身的传动设备来带动，花费并不多。以往女工用双手绞动两根竹针去除掉附着在皮辊、皮圈上的废棉花，非常吃力。最近，技术人员荣永宝创造了电动扦皮辊器，使用起来轻便省力，效率提高八倍多。
