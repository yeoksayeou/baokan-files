Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 2nd: After the Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on June 30th regarding the Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks, US State Department spokesman White issued a statement on the same day, desperately trying to justify the US government's interruption of the Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks. He claimed that the United States "does not intend" to "yield to China's fifteen-day ultimatum," even though the Chinese government's demand that the United States send an ambassadorial representative to resume talks within fifteen days was entirely reasonable, and the Chinese government had patiently waited for half a year after the US government unilaterally suspended the talks.

Since the Chinese government's statement further exposed the US government's interruption of the Sino-US talks before the world, putting the United States in an awkward position, White had to try to create the impression in his statement that the United States had not appointed an ambassadorial representative because of Johnson's transfer. He also hedged by saying, "Here (referring to the US government) has been actively considering selecting an ambassador and possibly changing the location of the talks." But he could not explain why, if the United States was sincere, it had not been able to send an ambassadorial representative to replace Johnson for so long.

As his arguments ran out, White had no choice but to repeat old slanders against the Chinese government's position in the Sino-US talks. White also insisted on calling the Chinese government's exercise of its sovereignty and the lawful sentencing of Americans who had committed crimes in China as "detention" of Americans, but he made no mention of the US government's illegal detention of thousands upon thousands of Chinese civilians in the United States.

    极力为破坏中美会谈找借口
    美国务院发言人只好老调重弹
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：6月30日中华人民共和国政府发表了关于中美大使级会谈的声明以后，美国国务院发言人怀特同一天就这一声明发表谈话，极力为美国政府中断中美大使级会谈进行辩解。他说什么美国“不打算”对中国政府“限期十五天的最后通牒屈服”，虽然中国政府的声明要求美国在十五天内派出大使级代表恢复会谈是完全合情合理的，中国政府在美国政府片面地中断会谈以后已经耐心地等待了半年之久。
    由于中国政府的声明在全世界面前进一步揭露了美国政府中断中美会谈的经过，使美国陷于狼狈的境地，怀特不得不在谈话中力图造成这样一种印象：美国没有指派大使级代表是因为约翰逊调职的缘故。他还支吾说：“这里（指美国政府）一直在积极考虑选派一位大使以及可能改变会谈地点的问题”。但是他无法说明，如果美国是有诚意的话，为什么竟然这么久还派不出一个代替约翰逊的大使级的代表来。
    由于理屈词穷，怀特在谈话中只好重弹老调，对中国政府在中美会谈中的立场大肆诬蔑。怀特还硬把中国政府行使自己主权，依法判处在中国犯了法的美国人一事说成是“扣留”美国人，但对美国政府非法扣留成千上万的在美国的中国平民一事却只字不提。
