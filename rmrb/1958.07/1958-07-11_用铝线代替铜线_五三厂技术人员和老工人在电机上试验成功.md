Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: Encouraged by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, technicians and veteran workers at Factory 53 have successfully developed a method of using aluminum wire instead of copper wire in motors. They have also created a way to produce fine aluminum wire using ordinary lathes.

During the trial production, the source of aluminum wire was the first major problem encountered. However, this problem was solved by the bold innovation and daring spirit of veteran worker Li Yunchao of the Second Workshop. Based on his past experience in machining lead wire and with the help of technician Han Changrong, he overcame various difficulties through numerous repeated experiments. Using only an ordinary lathe and a common lathe tool with an arc-shaped hole, he machined the aluminum wire. After technical appraisal, the aluminum wire machined by the lathe fully met quality requirements.

The second problem encountered in the trial production of aluminum wire replacing copper wire was surface oxidation and insulation of the aluminum wire. Generally, copper wire only needs to be coated with insulating varnish six times. However, even after coating aluminum wire more times than copper, the surface still could not be insulated. After more than fifty experiments, the aluminum wire was completely insulated.

The successful experiment of replacing copper wire with aluminum wire can not only save a large amount of copper for the country, but also extend the service life of each aluminum wire motor by thirty to forty years compared to copper wire motors, and greatly reduce costs.

    用铝线代替铜线
    五三厂技术人员和老工人在电机上试验成功
    据新华社9日讯　五三工厂技术人员与老工人在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，实现了在电机上用铝线代替铜线的办法，并且创造出用一般车床能够车出细细的铝线。
    在试制中，铝线的来源是碰到的头一个大的难题。但是这个难题，被二车间的老工人李云超大胆革新和敢想敢干的独创精神解决了。他根据自己过去车铅丝的原理和多年的实际经验，在技术员韩长荣的帮助下，经过无数次的反复试验，克服了种种困难，只用一台普通车床、一把普通带有弧形钻孔的车刀，就把铝线车了出来。经过技术鉴定，用车床车铝线完全合乎质量要求。
    在铝线代替铜线试制中碰到的第二个难题，是铝线的表面氧化和绝缘。一般铜线表面涂绝缘漆，只要涂六次便妥。但铝线涂漆的次数比铜还多，表面仍不能绝缘。他们经过五十多次的试验，铝线便完全绝缘了。
    铝线代替铜线的试验成功，不仅可以给国家节约大量的铜，每台铝线电机可比铜线电机的使用寿命多三十年到四十年，成本也可以大大降低。
