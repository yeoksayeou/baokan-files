　　Factories Run by Communes Everywhere, Everyone Learns Technology, New Farm Tools Promoted Within a Deadline
    Old Farm Tools Basically Disappear in Yiliang
    Work Hard for Five Days and Rest One Night, Work Hard for Ten Days and Perform Once: Production is Rhythmic and Labor Efficiency is High
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Huang Changlu reports: Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, has achieved semi-mechanization of transportation tools and new-style agricultural implements, solving the contradiction between high-speed agricultural production increase and labor shortage this year.
    Yiliang is the first county in Yunnan Province to achieve 800 jin of grain per mu, and this year the county plans to produce 2,800 jin per mu. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to invest several times or even dozens of times more labor than in previous years. For example, this year's water conservancy will irrigate an additional 100,000 mu, which is equal to the total area irrigated during the First Five-Year Plan period; last year, an average of 4,000 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and this year it will be increased to 50,000 jin. Other tasks such as soil improvement, deep plowing, and summer hoeing have also increased the amount of labor compared to previous years. Although the peasants' enthusiasm is unprecedented, there is still a shortage of 15 million labor days before the autumn harvest, which would require extending half a year to complete the work. The Yiliang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the county's peasants to firmly grasp the link of improving agricultural implements. In less than half a year, 110 types of transportation tools totaling more than 100,000 pieces have been promoted, with a total length of 520 li of wooden, iron, and steel rails, densely distributed like spider webs. 40,000 earth trains, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, and various handcarts shuttle back and forth transporting fertilizer and soil. In mountainous areas, 2,000 aerial transport cableways have been erected, and 500 wooden boats have been added along the rivers, basically eliminating the backward transportation methods of human carrying and shoulder pole carrying throughout the county. In terms of cultivation, 5,000 sets of field harrows, field digging machines, seeders, double-wheel double-share plows, and walking plows, as well as more than 10,000 pieces of weeding tools, have been promoted throughout the county. Old-fashioned agricultural implements have basically disappeared in the county. The average labor efficiency of the county has increased by two to three times, and the highest has reached twenty times. The labor intensity of the peasants has also been greatly reduced, and the rhythm of labor has been adjusted. Now, the countryside generally works hard for five days and rests one night, and performs and sings loudly every ten days.
    The vigorous development of the agricultural implement reform movement in Yiliang County is closely related to the leadership's personal involvement, with typical examples in everything. At the beginning of the movement, the county committee called on all agricultural cooperatives in the county to establish iron factories, wood factories, and fertilizer factories to eliminate human carrying, human digging, human sowing, and human harvesting, pointing out a clear direction for the agricultural implement reform movement. The county committee also made several resolutions one after another, setting deadlines for the promotion of various new tools, which greatly promoted the movement. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the movement, tool reform committees or groups were established at the county, township, and cooperative levels, led by the负责人负责人 of the party committees at all levels. The county committee also went deep into construction sites and rural areas, cultivated typical examples based on the issues raised in production, and promoted them vigorously. At the beginning of this year, the labor force at the water conservancy construction sites was the most strained. The county committee conducted a pilot project at a reservoir construction site, laying iron and wooden rails, erecting cableways, manufacturing pushcarts, and improving compaction tools. In five days, human carrying and human compaction were eliminated, and work efficiency was increased by twelve times. The county committee immediately organized cadres, technicians, and migrant workers from fifteen medium-sized and larger water conservancy construction sites in the county to visit the site. Half a month later, these fifteen construction sites eliminated human carrying, human digging, and human compaction. Later, the county committee found that the labor force for soil improvement and fertilizer accumulation was also very strained, and cultivated a second typical example for promotion. The county worked hard for ten days and nights and achieved semi-mechanization of agricultural transportation.
    The second reason for the rapid development of the Yiliang agricultural implement improvement movement is that every commune has a factory, everyone learns technology, and relies on the masses to manufacture and improve agricultural implements through self-reliance. At the beginning of the movement, the county-run iron and wood factories were mainly relied on to trial-produce new agricultural implements, which played a significant role. However, later on, it was far from meeting the needs. Therefore, the county committee instructed everyone to learn technology, and every commune to run a factory to establish agricultural implement manufacturing bases. The county-run factories assisted the agricultural cooperatives in training technicians and supplying certain parts that the agricultural cooperatives could not manufacture themselves. Now, the 99 agricultural cooperatives in the county have established more than 200 iron and wood factories and trained more than 2,000 technicians. After the Happiness Cooperative established its own iron and wood factory, it successfully manufactured new agricultural implements such as walking plows, double-share plows, weeding hoes, turning harrows, and seeders. Some of the new-style agricultural implements are comparable to the products of large factories. All the new-style agricultural implements used by the cooperative in this year's spring plowing were self-made by the cooperative's factory.
    The third reason for the significant effectiveness of Yiliang's agricultural implement improvement is the timely discovery and resolution of a series of new problems arising from the agricultural implement reform, enabling the movement to develop in a consolidated and sustained manner. After the agricultural implement reform, the agricultural cooperatives had to manage both agriculture and industry, and the original organizational form could no longer adapt to the new needs. The county committee promptly instructed the agricultural cooperatives to change the all-inclusive organizational form, establish specialized factories and professional groups, and also establish professional groups within each agricultural production team to undertake various technical tasks. With the popularization of new agricultural implements, the original quotas were no longer reasonable. The agricultural cooperatives promptly revised them, so that the labor remuneration obtained from using new agricultural implements was slightly higher than that obtained from using old agricultural implements, and the remuneration for technicians was slightly higher than that for ordinary agricultural labor, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members in learning technology and using new agricultural implements. In order to facilitate the use of new agricultural implements and transportation tools, the counties and communes carried out a comprehensive plan for roads, land, and irrigation ditches. At present, many townships and communes have straightened roads and irrigation ditches, thickened and widened field ridges, and interconnected iron and wooden rails, so that various vehicles can reach the fields in all directions. This not only facilitates transportation but also saves cultivated land. Many small cooperatives felt financially difficult in promoting new agricultural implements on a large scale due to a lack of public accumulation, and requested to merge cooperatives. According to the demands of the masses, the county committee has helped two small cooperatives in Jiuxiang merge into one large cooperative and is preparing to merge the small cooperatives with less than 200 households throughout the county into large cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In addition, in the agricultural implement improvement movement, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses in learning culture and science and technology, the county plans to immediately carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy.
    At present, the factories of the agricultural cooperatives in the county have begun to manufacture threshers, harvesters, and slicers for autumn harvest so that everyone can use new agricultural implements during the autumn harvest. (Attached chart)

　　社社办工厂　人人学技术　限期推广新农具
    宜良旧农具基本绝迹
    大干五天休息一晚，大干十天演唱一次，生产有节奏，劳动效率高
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：云南省宜良县实现了运输工具半机械化与新式农具化，解决了今年农业高速度增产与劳动力不足的矛盾。
    宜良是云南省第一个粮食亩产八百斤的县，今年全县计划亩产二千八百斤。为了实现这个指标，需要投入数倍乃至数十倍于往年的劳动。如今年水利要增灌十万亩，等于第一个五年计划期间增灌面积的总和；去年平均每亩施肥四千市斤，今年增加为五万市斤。其他如改良土壤、深耕多犁、中耕夏锄等比往年增加的劳动量也很大。虽然农民干劲空前，但到秋收前全县还差一千五百万个劳动日，需要延长半年时间才能把活干完。中共宜良县委领导全县农民狠狠地抓住改良农具这一环。不到半年就推广了运输工具一百一十种共十万余件，木轨、铁轨、钢筋轨共五百二十里长，像蛛网一样四处密布，四万辆土火车、马车、牛车以及各式手推车穿梭似的运送着肥料和土壤。在山区，架设了二千条空中运输索道，河流沿岸增加了五百只木船，基本上在全县消灭了人背肩挑的落后运输方法。在耕作方面，全县推广了五千部划田耙、挖田机、播种机、双轮双铧犁和步犁以及一万多件中耕除草的工具，旧式农具在全县已基本绝迹。全县劳动效率平均提高了二至三倍，最高的达二十倍。农民的劳动强度也大大减轻，调节了劳动的节奏。现在农村普遍是大干五天休息一晚，十天大演大唱一次。
    宜良县农具改革运动能猛烈开展，与领导亲自抓，事事有典型有很大关系。当运动开展之初，县委便号召全县农业社建立铁工厂、木工厂和肥料工厂，消灭人挑、人背、人挖、人下种、人割，给农具改革运动指出了明确的方向。县委又先后几次作出决议，限期推广各种新工具，对运动起了很大促进作用。为了加强对运动的具体领导，县、乡、社三级都成立了工具改革委员会或小组，由各级党委负责人亲自领导。县委还深入到工地和农村，根据生产中提出的课题培养典型，拿出样板，大力推广。今年年初水利工地的劳动力最紧张，县委就在一个水库工地试点，铺设铁、木轨，架索道飞兜，制造推车，改进夯压工具，五天便消灭了人背人挑和人夯压，工效提高了十二倍。县委马上组织全县十五个中型和较大小型水利工地的干部、技工和民工到现场参观，半个月后，这十五个工地就消灭了人挑人背人挖和人夯压。以后，县委发现改良土壤和积肥的劳动力也很紧张，又培养第二个典型推广，全县苦战十昼夜实现了农业运输的半机械化。
    宜良农具改良运动迅速开展的第二个原因是社社有工厂，人人学技术，依靠群众自力更生来制造和改良农具。运动开始时，主要依靠县办的铁工厂和木工厂试制新农具，起了不小的作用。但后来就远远不能满足需要了。于是县委指示人人学技术，社社办工厂，建立农具制造基地。县办的工厂则协助农业社培养技术工人，供给农业社自己不能制造的某些配件。现在，全县九十九个农业社已办起二百余座铁木工厂，培养出二千多名技术工人。幸福社自办铁、木工厂后，制造成功了步犁、双铧犁、薅秧锄、翻身耙和播种机等新农具，有的新式农具可与大工厂的产品媲美。该社今年春耕中所用的新式农具全部是由社里工厂自制的。
    宜良改良农具获得显著成效的第三个原因是及时发现和解决由于农具改革而产生的一系列新问题，使运动得以巩固和持久地发展。农具改革后，农业社既要管农业，又要管工业，原来的组织形式已不能适应新的需要，县委及时指示各农业社改变一揽子的组织形式，成立专门的工厂和专业组，各农业生产队内也建立专业的小组，分工担负各种技术性的劳动。随着新农具的普及，原有的定额已不合理，各农业社都及时作了修改，让使用新农具所得劳动报酬比使用旧农具所得报酬略高，使技术工比普通农业劳动的报酬略高，以刺激社员学习技术和使用新农具的积极性。为了便于使用新的农具和运输工具，全县各乡、社还对道路、土地、水渠等进行了全面的规划。现在，许多乡、社已将道路和水渠取直，把田埂培厚加宽，铁、木轨道互相衔接，使各种车辆四通八达，直到田间。这样不仅便利了运输，也节省了耕地。许多小社因公共积累少，在大量推广新农具中感到资金困难，要求并社；县委根据群众要求，已帮助九乡两个小社合并成一个大社，并准备在秋收后将全县二百户以下的小社分别并成大社。此外，在农具改良运动中，为了满足广大群众学习文化和科学技术的需要，全县计划立即进行扫除文盲的工作。
    目前，全县农业社的工厂已开始制造秋收用的打谷机、收割机和切片机等，使秋收时人人使用新农具。（附图表）
