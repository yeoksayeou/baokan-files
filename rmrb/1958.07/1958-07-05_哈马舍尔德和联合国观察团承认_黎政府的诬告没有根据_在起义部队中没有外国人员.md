Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 4th: United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld said at a press conference on July 3rd that there is "currently no" "large-scale infiltration" of personnel and supplies into Lebanon.

Hammarskjöld held the press conference shortly after receiving the first report of the UN Observer Group in Lebanon, which was investigating the Lebanese government's accusations of "large-scale infiltration" of Lebanon by the United Arab Republic, under the instigation and support of the United States and Britain, in accordance with the Security Council resolution.

Hammarskjöld pointed out that, to his knowledge, there is currently no such "large-scale infiltration." He said, "We currently have no basis for making such a judgment."

Since there were reports that the Lebanese government was planning to request a Security Council meeting within forty-eight hours, demanding that a UN military force be sent to seal the Lebanese border, a reporter asked Hammarskjöld whether a Security Council meeting was now necessary. In response, Hammarskjöld said that this issue "must also be considered based on" the observers' report.

The UN subsequently released the Observer Group's report. The report stated that the Observer Group had found no evidence that anyone had crossed the border of the United Arab Republic to participate in the war in Lebanon. The report stated that the Observer Group had conducted investigations throughout Lebanon, receiving a large number of reports daily from its patrol teams and subjecting them to "the most careful study." The result was that no one among the armed personnel of the rebel forces was found to be from other countries. The report also stated that most of the weapons the Observer Group saw were British, French, and Italian-made rifles, and the landmines were also British and French-made.

    哈马舍尔德和联合国观察团承认
    黎政府的诬告没有根据
    在起义部队中没有外国人员
    据新华社4日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德3日在记者招待会上说，“目前并不存在”人员和物资“大规模地渗透到”黎巴嫩的情况。
    哈马舍尔德是在接到联合国观察团在黎巴嫩的调查的第一个报告以后不久举行记者招待会的，这个观察团根据安全理事会的决议调查了在美英两国怂恿和支持下黎巴嫩政府提出的所谓阿拉伯联合共和国对黎巴嫩“大规模渗透”的指责。
    哈马舍尔德指出，就他所知，目前并没有这种“大规模渗透”。他说，“我们目前还没有作这种判断的根据”。
    由于有消息说，黎巴嫩政府正计划在四十八小时内要求召开安全理事会会议，要求派出一支联合国军事部队去封锁黎巴嫩边境，有记者问哈马舍尔德，现在是否需要举行一次安全理事会会议。哈马舍尔德在回答时说，这个问题也“必须根据”观察员的报告来考虑。
    联合国随后公布了观察团的报告。报告说，观察团并没有发现有证据证明有人越过阿拉伯联合共和国边境到黎巴嫩参加战争。报告说，观察团曾经到黎巴嫩各地进行调查，它每天从它的巡逻小组收到大批报告，并且加以“最仔细的研究”，结果并没有发现起义部队武装人员中有人是来自其他国家。报告还说，观察团看到的武器大多数是英国、法国和意大利制造的步枪，地雷也是英国和法国制造的。
