Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 9th. Workers at the Fujian Province's Mawei Shipyard recently successfully trial-produced an amphibious universal crawler vehicle. It can tow tillage machinery for plowing in paddy fields and dry land, as well as tow transportation on water and land. At the same time, it can also drive small grain threshers, generators, rice milling machines, water pumps, etc.

This amphibious universal tractor uses diesel as fuel and is equipped with a 14-horsepower two-cylinder diesel engine, a water pump, and a generator. When towing a four-bottom plow in a paddy field, it can plow three and a half mu of land per hour, with slightly lower fuel consumption than ordinary tractors. In addition to being able to tow a trailer carrying more than two tons of agricultural products or other materials on land, it can also freely enter the water on steep stream banks and transport materials (carrying about 1200 jin of materials).

    两栖万能拖拉机
    新华社福州9日电  福建省马尾造船厂职工最近试制成功一部两栖万能履带机车。它可以在水田、旱地拖带耕作机械耕地，也能在水上和陆地牵引运输，同时还能带动小型扬谷机、发电机、碾米机、抽水机等。
    这部两栖万能拖拉机是用柴油作燃料，装有十四马力二缸柴油机、抽水机、发电机各一部；它在水田上拖带一部四铧犁，每小时能耕地三亩半，消耗的燃料比普通拖拉机略低一些。它除在陆地可以牵引一辆挂车载运二吨多农产品或其他物资外，还可以在坡度很大的溪河边自由下水，载运物资（约可运一千二百斤物资）。
