Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 1st - Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing production is growing at a rate far exceeding that of the United States. From 1950 to 1956, Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing production increased by 170%, while the United States only increased by 50% during the same period.

Currently, Czechoslovakia's production of metal-cutting lathes, planers, steam turbines, chemical industrial equipment, railway freight cars, motorized bicycles, and household washing machines, per capita, already exceeds that of advanced capitalist countries.

According to the instructions of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, by 1965, Czechoslovakia's machine manufacturing production will increase by 130% compared to 1957. By then, Czechoslovakia will become one of the countries with the highest per capita machine manufacturing output in the world. This production increase plan will mainly rely on improving labor productivity to achieve.

    捷机器制造业飞速发展
    增长速度大大超过美国
    新华社布拉格1日电　捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业生产增长速度大大超过美国。在1950年到1956年这段时期，捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业的生产增长了170％，而同一时期内美国只增长了50％。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克的金属切削车床、刨床、蒸汽涡轮、化学工业装备、铁道货车、机器脚踏车以及家庭用洗衣机的按人口计算的产量已经超过先进的资本主义国家。
    根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会的指示，到1965年，捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业的生产将比1957年增长130％。到那时，捷克斯洛伐克将成为世界上按人口计算的机器制造业产量最高的国家之一。这一增产计划将主要依靠提高劳动生产率来实现。
