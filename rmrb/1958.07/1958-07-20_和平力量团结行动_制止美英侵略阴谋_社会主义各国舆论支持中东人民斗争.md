Xinhua News Agency Report: According to Xinhua News Agency reports, newspapers in socialist countries continue to publish commentaries supporting the struggle of the people of the Middle East and condemning the aggressive acts of the United States and Britain. These commentaries unanimously pointed out that the socialist camp, with its unprecedented strength, is a loyal friend of the people striving for national independence and a strong bastion for safeguarding world peace. As long as peaceful forces unite and fight together, they can stop the aggressive acts of imperialism.

    "Rodong Sinmun" (North Korea):
    The Korean War Proved that the United States is a Paper Tiger
    "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published an editorial on the 18th saying that the Korean people, who are struggling to drive the US imperialists out of South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, believe that the struggle of the Arab people against US-British imperialists is their own common task, and therefore give it their full support. The editorial pointed out that the Korean people proved in the Korean War that the armed aggression of Western imperialists is not to be feared. We are convinced that if the people of Lebanon, Iraq, and other Arab countries unite to resist the aggressors, then final victory will surely belong to them.

    "Nhan Dan" (Vietnam):
    The People Can Lock Up the Hands of Warmongers
    The "Nhan Dan" newspaper, the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 18th, saying that the intervention of US imperialists and their accomplices in the affairs of the Middle and Near East countries is a blatant act of madness. However, the power of the people can lock up the hands of madmen. The editorial pointed out that the peaceful forces of the world, the strength of the Arab people, and the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp are much stronger than they were a few years ago, and this strength has completely surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp.

    "Unen" (Mongolia):
    US Imperialists Fear the Voice of the People
    The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published an editorial on the 18th, condemning the US imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon. The editorial said that because the people of Iraq overthrew the imperialist lackey Faisal dynasty, established a republic, and declared their adherence to the principles of the Bandung Conference, the US imperialists, who have always feared the voice of the people, began to launch an armed attack on Lebanon. The editorial said that the Mongolian people will always stand on the side of the Lebanese people and believe that victory will surely belong to the Lebanese people.

    "Nepszabadsag" (Hungary):
    The Conspiracies of the Aggressors Are Bound to Fail
    The Hungarian newspaper "Nepszabadsag" published a commentary on the 18th, condemning the crimes of US-British imperialism in invading Arab countries. The commentary pointed out that the conspiracies of the aggressors are bound to fail. Today, the peace-loving forces of the whole world, just as in the Suez Canal crisis of 1956, have united to resolutely oppose the aggressors. The Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp have lodged serious protests with the US-British imperialists, demanding that they immediately cease their acts of aggression. This is support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Middle East. The commentary pointed out that the united peace forces are a significant force. It forced the US aggressor army to cease fire in Korea, shattered the Anglo-French aggression against the Suez Canal, and crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956.

    "Scinteia" (Romania):
    US and Britain are Playing with Fire to Protect Oil Interests
    On the 18th, Romanian newspapers strongly condemned the crimes of the United States and Britain in invading Arab countries, and firmly demanded that US and British troops get out of the Arab world! "Scinteia" pointed out that US, British, and French imperialists are uniting to create a large-scale war against the Arab people. Their purpose is to suppress the people in this region who hope for freedom and independence, and to protect the interests of oil monopolists in the Middle and Near East. "Scinteia" called on the peace-loving people of the world to unite, force the aggressors to retreat, and guarantee world peace.

    "Zeri i Popullit" (Albania):
    The Arab People Have the Support of the Whole World
    The Albanian newspaper "Zeri i Popullit" published an editorial on the 17th, saying that the US aggression against Arab countries has threatened world peace. The Albanian people, like the people of all countries in the world, regard freedom and peace as the most noble things. We sympathize with the Arab people's struggle for freedom.
    The editorial of "Bashkimi" said that the Arab people's brave struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs is invincible.
