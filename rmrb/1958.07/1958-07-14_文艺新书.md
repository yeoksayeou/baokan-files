Literary New Books

    "A Selection of One Hundred Folk Songs from the Great Leap Forward"
    The Poetry Journal Press has recently compiled and printed "A Selection of One Hundred Folk Songs from the Great Leap Forward." These one hundred folk songs are all short and concise works, fully expressing the heroic spirit and labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people in socialist construction. They are political mobilization poems in the fields for the peasant masses, and hymns of the struggle for production. It is well worth reading as a book to be carried around.
    The Poetry Journal Press will also compile and print "A Selection of One Hundred Workers' Poems" and "A Selection of One Hundred Soldiers' Poems."
                        (Yan Mai)
    "Baiyangdian Chronicle"
    This collection of short stories includes fifty-four short stories by Sun Li. Most of these short stories are about the people and events on the Hebei-Central Plains during the Anti-Japanese War. These works depict many heroic figures of the people, leaving a deep impression on the readers. (Yi Bing)
    "Chick Collection"
    This is a collection of essays by Han Zi, including twenty-nine short and pithy essays. These essays describe various fresh things and the noble qualities of new characters; portray the excellent qualities of the children cultivated by the socialist motherland; and eulogize the glorious deeds of the volunteer soldiers on the Korean battlefield. The works are full of enthusiasm and poetry, inspiring people to forge ahead in the new life. (Bi Fang)
    "Snow and Valley"
    This is a collection of lyrical narrative poems by Guo Xiaochuan, including two long poems, "Ode to White Snow" and "Deep Valley". In "Ode to White Snow", the author enthusiastically sings the praises of a revolutionary couple's noble character of loyalty to the revolution and loyalty to love. They were separated in a fierce battle. When they reunited in victory, they were both blameless in their hearts for being as pure as white snow in politics and love. "Deep Valley" expresses the serious attitude of another female Communist Party member towards revolution and love. When she discovered that her lover was a coward and traitor in battle, she resolutely cut off her thoughts of him. In these two long poems, the author, with clear love and hate, praises the noble qualities of communists and lashes out at the ugly souls of cowards and traitors. (Lin Meng)
        "Second Exam"
    This is a collection of essays with novel content, including more than ten essays written by He Weijin in the past two years. These short and refined essays reflect the ever-changing face of the socialist motherland and the growth of the communist qualities of the younger generation through some meaningful stories.
    From these essays, it can be seen that the author has a full enthusiasm for the socialist cause, so he can discover the buds of new things in the daily life of the people, and see its connection with our country's advanced social system.
                        (Yan Mai)

    “大跃进民歌选一百首”
    诗刊社最近编印一本“大跃进民歌选一百首”。这一百首民歌都是短小精粹的作品，它们充分表达了中国人民在社会主义建设中的英雄气概和劳动热忱。它们是农民群众在田间的政治鼓动诗，又是生产斗争的颂歌。很值得做为人手一册的读物。
    诗刊社还将编印“工人诗歌选一百首”和“战士诗歌选一百首”。

    “白洋淀纪事”
    这本短篇集共收集了孙犁的五十四个短篇。这些短篇写的大多是抗日战争期间冀中平原上的人和事。这些作品描绘了不少人民的英雄人物，给读者留下了较深的印象。　　　（一兵）
    “幼雏集”
    这是菡子的一本散文集，包括二十九篇短小精悍的散文。这些散文描述了各种各样新鲜的事物和新人物崇高的品质；刻画了社会主义祖国教养出来的孩子们的优良品质；歌颂了朝鲜战场上志愿军战士的光辉事绩。作品热情洋溢，诗意横生，鼓舞人们在新的生活中奋勇前进。　　　（毕方）
    “雪与山谷”
    这是郭小川的一本抒情叙事诗集，包括长诗“白雪的赞歌”和“深深的山谷”两首。在“白雪的赞歌”中，作者热烈地歌颂了一对革命夫妇忠于革命、忠于爱情的高尚品德。他们在一场激烈的战斗中失散了。当他们在胜利中再度重逢的时候，他们彼此都以在政治上和爱情上像白雪一样的纯洁而无愧于心。“深深的山谷”抒写了另外一个女共产党员对待革命和爱情的严肃态度，当她发现自己的爱人在战斗中是一个懦夫和叛徒，她就毅然对他割断了思念。在这两首长诗中，作者以鲜明的爱憎，赞美了共产主义者的崇高品质，鞭挞了懦夫叛徒的丑恶灵魂。　　（林蒙）

    这是一本内容新颖的散文集，包括何为近两年来所写散文十余篇。这些短小精炼的散文，通过一些意味深长的故事，反映了社会主义祖国日新月异的面貌，以及青年一代共产主义品质的成长。
