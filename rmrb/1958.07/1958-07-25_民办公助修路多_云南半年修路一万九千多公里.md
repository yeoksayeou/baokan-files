    Great Leap Forward in Production: Transportation Takes the Lead
    More Public-Private Partnership in Road Construction
    Yunnan Builds Over 19,000 Kilometers of Roads in Half a Year
    According to the Yunnan Daily, since the Yunnan Provincial Department of Transportation devolved road construction tasks this year, following the principles of "relying on local areas, relying on the masses, and prioritizing popularization," it has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm for road construction in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, from January to June, various regions constructed 1,423 kilometers of highways and added 17,814 kilometers of horse-drawn and ox-cart roads.
    Under the leadership of the Party committees, many areas are fully utilizing local manpower, financial resources, and materials to develop local road construction, based on the principle of "public-private partnership," with the entire Party and all the people working together. Xinping County is a mountainous area with diverse ethnic groups and abundant forests, minerals, and cash crops. However, before liberation, there were no highways in the entire county, and transportation was extremely inconvenient. To change this situation, in 1956, the state invested more than 700,000 yuan to help the county build highways. However, due to the adoption of the "government-run, people-assisted" method, only one highway of 59 kilometers was built, and the project quality was not up to standard. In the first half of this year, the county earnestly mobilized the masses, organized various sideline productions to solve the funding needed for road construction, and without state investment, built 150 kilometers of simple highways and 280 kilometers of horse-drawn cart roads, connecting the mountainous areas with the plains, the border areas with the interior, and promoting the urban and rural economy. According to the principle of "masses build roads, government assists," Huaning County newly built 243 kilometers of simple highways, 257 kilometers of horse-drawn cart roads, and 442 ox-cart roads in just over three months, and the county's road network has initially taken shape. Recently, Zhaotong, Lincang, and other special districts have decided to mobilize more than 100,000 people to engage in large-scale road construction projects.

    生产大跃进　交通打先锋
    民办公助修路多
    云南半年修路一万九千多公里
    据云南日报报道　云南省交通厅根据“依靠地方、依靠群众、普及为主”的方针，今年下放筑路任务以后，大大激发了各地筑路的积极性。据不完全的统计，1至6月份各地修筑的公路有一千四百二十三公里，新增马车、牛车路一万七千八百一十四公里。
    许多地区都在党委的领导下，根据“民办公助”原则，全党全民一齐动手，充分使用地方的人力、财力、物力发展地方道路建设。新平县是一个多民族和森林矿产、经济作物丰富的山区，但在解放前全县没有一条公路，交通非常闭塞。为了改变这种状况，1956年由国家投资七十多万元帮助这个县修筑公路，但是由于采取“公办民助”的办法，仅修了一条长达五十九公里的公路，而且工程质量也不合规格。今年上半年，这个县认真发动群众，组织多种副业生产来解决筑路所需经费，国家没有投资就修了一百五十公里简易公路、二百八十公里马车路，使山区与平坝、边疆和内地联成一片，繁荣了城乡的经济。华宁县根据“群众修路，政府帮助”的原则，仅三个多月的时间就新修了简易公路二百四十三公里、马车路二百五十七公里、牛车路四百四十二条，全县的道路网已初步形成。最近，昭通、临沧等专区又决定动员十多万群众，投入规模巨大的筑路工程。
