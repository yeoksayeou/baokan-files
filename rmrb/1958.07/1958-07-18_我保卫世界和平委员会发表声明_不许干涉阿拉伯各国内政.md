Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense today issued a statement in support of the Lebanese and Iraqi people against U.S. and British interference. The full text is as follows:

The American aggressors have directly sent troops to Lebanon to carry out armed intervention and are seriously threatening Iraq. British interventionist troops also invaded Jordan today. Such heinous acts of aggression by U.S. and British imperialism have greatly deteriorated the international situation and seriously threatened peace in the Middle East and the world. The Chinese people condemn and protest the war adventures of U.S. and British imperialism with utmost anger.

The Chinese people believe that the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the reactionary dynasty and the Lebanese people's struggle against the traitorous Chamoun clique for independence and freedom are entirely the internal affairs of Iraq and Lebanon.

The arrogant attempt by U.S. and British imperialism to carry out armed intervention is to strangle the national independence movement of the entire Arab countries, establish American colonial rule in the Near and Middle East, and make a desperate struggle for British colonial rule in this region. All peace-loving and just people in the world must not stand idly by in the face of such blatant acts of aggression. We warn the U.S. and British imperialists that they must immediately withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan, and not interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries, otherwise those who play with fire will burn themselves. The disgraceful end suffered by British and French imperialism in the Suez Canal incident is a lesson for the U.S. and British aggressors!

The Chinese people fully support the struggle of the Lebanese, Iraqi, and all Arab peoples against imperialism and for national independence, and regard this struggle as an important part of defending peace in the Middle East and the world. We firmly believe that the Arab people, with their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, defeat the armed intervention and aggressive conspiracies of U.S. and British imperialism and achieve a complete victory in national independence and freedom!

    我保卫世界和平委员会发表声明
    不许干涉阿拉伯各国内政
    新华社17日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今日发表声援黎巴嫩人民和伊拉克人民反对美、英干涉的声明，全文如下：
    美国侵略者已经直接出兵黎巴嫩，进行武装干涉，而且严重威胁着伊拉克。英国干涉军也已经在今天侵入约旦。美、英帝国主义这种穷凶极恶的侵略行动，已使国际局势大大恶化，使中东和全世界的和平受到严重的威胁。中国人民怀着万分愤怒的心情谴责并抗议美、英帝国主义的战争冒险行动。
    中国人民认为，伊拉克人民推翻反动王朝的革命和黎巴嫩人民反对夏蒙卖国集团、争取独立自由的斗争完全是伊、黎两国的内政。
    美、英帝国主义进行武装干涉的狂妄企图是要扼杀整个阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动，在中近东建立起美国的殖民统治，并且为英国在这一地区的殖民统治作垂死挣扎。全世界一切爱好和平与正义的人们决不能对这种明目张胆的侵略行为袖手旁观。我们警告美、英帝国主义者，必须立即把侵略军队撤出黎巴嫩、约旦，不许干涉阿拉伯各国的内政，否则玩火者必将自焚，英法帝国主义者在苏伊士运河事件中所遭到的可耻下场正是美、英侵略者的前车之鉴！
    中国人民全力支持黎巴嫩、伊拉克和所有阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争，并把这个斗争看作是保卫中东和全世界和平的重要部分。我们深信，具有光荣的反帝斗争传统的阿拉伯人民在全世界人民的同情和支持下，一定会战胜美、英帝国主义的武装干涉和侵略阴谋，取得民族独立自由的彻底胜利！
                    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
