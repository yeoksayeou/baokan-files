Xinhua News Agency, July 28th - According to an Indian traveler who arrived in Beirut on July 27th, as reported by the Indian Press Trust, "there is a tense state" between the Jordanian people and the British invading troops.

It is reported that travelers arriving in Beirut also said that some units of the Jordanian army opposed the British invading forces patrolling the Jordanian capital Amman. These Jordanian troops warned the British that if they patrolled in Amman, they would be shot at.

The news also stated that because more and more people in the Jordanian army are against the British invading forces and the Jordanian puppet King Hussein, Hussein is mobilizing all Bedouin and Circassian officers to support him. These reactionary tribal officers are the pillars of Hussein's petty dynasty.

Agence France-Presse also reported from Amman on the 27th that although martial law has been in effect for fifteen months, the domestic situation in Jordan remains tense. It is reported that in order to maintain his tottering rule, Hussein is "conducting purges and reorganizing the highest administrative and military departments."

On the 27th, a spokesman for the Hussein government denied widespread reports that Jordan intended to sign a treaty with Britain allowing British troops to remain in Jordan for five years. However, a Reuters reporter revealed in a dispatch from Amman on the 27th that Hussein is very likely to sign this traitorous treaty that would allow British invading forces to occupy Jordan for a long time. The Reuters reporter wrote, "Now that Jordan seems to have once again become a Western protectorate, this may be one of the several possibilities that the Jordanian government is considering."

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th, Amman News: Starting on the evening of the 27th, the U.S. Air Force began helping Britain airlift military supplies from Cyprus to Jordan to supply the British invading forces in Jordan.

According to the British Embassy in Jordan, about twelve C-119 American transport planes are participating in this airlift.

According to the British announcement, there are now approximately two thousand five hundred British invading troops in Jordan.

    约旦国内形势很紧张
    侯赛因小朝廷更加不稳
    新华社28日讯　据印度报业托辣斯记者27日引到达贝鲁特的一位印度旅行家的话报道，约旦老百姓同英国侵略军队之间“存在着紧张的状态。”
    据报道，到达贝鲁特的旅客们还说，约旦军队中的一些部队反对英国侵略军到约旦首都安曼巡逻，这些约旦部队警告英军，如果英军在安曼巡逻，就要向他们开枪。
    消息还说，由于约旦军队中反对英国侵略军和约旦傀儡国王侯赛因的人越来越多，侯赛因正在调集所有的贝都印族和契尔克斯族的军官来支持他。这些部落的反动军官都是侯赛因小王朝的支柱。
    法新社在27日也自安曼报道说，尽管戒严令已经实行了十五个月，约旦的国内形势仍然很紧张。据报道，侯赛因为了维持他的摇摇欲坠的统治，正在“进行清洗和重新改组各最高级的行政和军事部门”。
    侯赛因政府的发言人在27日否认了盛传关于约旦打算同英国签订一项允许英国军队在约旦留驻五年的条约的消息。但是，路透社记者在27日从安曼发出的消息中却透露，侯赛因极有可能同英国签订这项使英国侵略军能够长期侵占约旦的卖国条约。路透社记者写道，“既然现在约旦看起来已经再一次成为西方的保护国，这可能是约旦政府正在考虑的几个可能性之一。”
    新华社28日讯　安曼消息：美国空军从27日晚上开始帮助英国把军火从塞浦路斯空运到约旦，供应在约旦的英国侵略军。
    据英国驻约旦大使馆宣布，参加这次空运的约有十二架C—119型美国运输机。
    据英方宣布，约旦现在大约有英国侵略军二千五百人。
