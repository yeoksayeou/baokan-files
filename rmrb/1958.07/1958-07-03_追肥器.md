    Fertilizer Applicator

    In the past, whenever we mentioned topdressing fertilizer, a picture would inevitably appear before us: people toiling under the scorching sun, carrying manure baskets, bending over, and grabbing handfuls of manure to place next to the seedlings; or, using a ladle to scoop manure liquid from a manure bucket and pour it next to the seedlings. A person could be exhausted all day and still not be able to topdress even two mu of land, and the application would be uneven, wasting a lot of fertilizer.

    Farmers urgently demanded a change in this backward method of topdressing. Sun Dianchen, a member of the Wuxing Cooperative in Kangping County, Liaoning Province, was one of them. This spring, with the help of the cooperative's blacksmith, he created a small, exquisite, lightweight, and practical fertilizer applicator. This fertilizer applicator was created based on the principle of a sprayer and is specifically used for applying liquid fertilizers such as human waste and urine. The fertilizer applicator consists of components such as a fertilizer storage tank, a piston, a pump, and a hoe shovel with holes. When using it, liquid fertilizer is loaded into the storage tank, and the hoe shovel is inserted into the soil next to the roots of the crops; then, the lever is pushed and pulled, causing the fertilizer to pass from the storage tank through the pump, injecting the liquid fertilizer into the soil. Using this fertilizer applicator, one person can topdress five mu of land in a day, and five laborers can be saved when topdressing one qing of land. Not only does it save fertilizer and apply it evenly, but it also preserves the effectiveness of the liquid fertilizer. This fertilizer applicator is made entirely of thin iron and is currently being promoted in the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative and Kangping County. (Attached picture)

### 追肥器

    追肥器
    过去，提到追肥，不能不在我们面前出现这样一幅图景：人们在烈日下，提着粪筐，弯着腰，一把一把地用手将粪抓放在苗旁；或者是，把大粪汤一勺一勺地从粪桶里舀出倒在苗旁。一个人一天累得要死，也追不上二亩地肥，而且追的不均匀，浪费许多粪。
    农民迫切要求改变这种落后的追肥方法。迈宁省康平县五星社社员孙殿臣就是其中一个。今年春天，在社里铁匠的帮助下，制造出一台小巧玲珑、轻便适用的追肥器。这台追肥器是根据喷雾器原理创造的，专门用来追人粪尿等液体肥料。追肥器由储肥箱、活塞、唧筒和带孔的锄铲等部件组成的。使用的时候，将液体肥料装入储肥箱，把锄铲插入庄稼根旁土中；然后推、拉提杆，使粪肥由储肥箱经过唧筒，把液体肥料注射到土中。使用这种追肥器，一个人一天就可以追五亩地，追一垧地可以节省五个劳动力。不仅省肥料、追的均匀，还可以保住液体肥料的效能。这个追肥器全部是薄铁制成的，目前已在五星农业社和康平县推广。（附图片）
