Xinhua Daily News: The Jiangsu Provincial Trade Union Federation, upon entering the fourth stage of rectification, continued to launch a mass airing of views and debates, focusing on the fundamental issue of how trade unions can fully play their role as assistants under the leadership of the Party.

During the major rectification and major changes, the Jiangsu Provincial Trade Union Federation organized the masses to express their views and debate the issue of how to fully play the role of assistants under the leadership of the Party Committee, but it was not done deeply or thoroughly enough. Therefore, before entering the fourth stage of rectification, it conducted an inspection based on the spirit of the General Line and the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. It was discovered that some comrades, and even some leading cadres, were not very clear about or had resistance to the fundamental issue that trade unions must fully accept the leadership of the Party not only in political thought but also in organization and work. Therefore, the Provincial Trade Union Federation decided to launch the masses again to conduct airing of views and debates on the fundamental issue of how trade unions can fully play their role as assistants under the leadership of the Party, in order to criticize erroneous ideas and ensure the Party's absolute leadership over trade unions and the workers' movement.

According to the preliminary materials revealed, some comrades emphasized the professional nature of trade union work and the particularity of industrial work, believing that "the Party's leadership over trade unions is leadership in political thought" and that trade unions should have "independent activities" in organization and work. Individual responsible comrades of industrial trade unions believed that "it is not justified for local trade unions (referring to the provincial federation) to lead industrial trade unions," and even went so far as to not seriously implement the opinions of the Party Group of the Provincial Trade Union Federation. For example, the Party Group of the Provincial Federation decided that the Provincial Highway Transportation Trade Union should focus on the work of scattered transport workers, but individual leading comrades of the industrial trade union made excuses for a long time and did not seriously implement it. Individual responsible comrades of the Provincial Education Trade Union have long believed that "the education trade union is special, and the Party Group of the Provincial Trade Union Federation does not understand the work," so they expressed "no interest" in the leadership of the Party Group. They thought that the meetings convened by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Trade Union were "not good not to attend, irrelevant to attend," and were indifferent to the Party's central tasks. Some industrial trade unions and business departments of the Provincial Trade Union had resistance when the Standing Committee of the Provincial Trade Union implemented the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, organized unified work teams to go down to grasp the central work, and transferred cadres to them. For example, when the Provincial Light Industry Trade Union and the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Trade Union sometimes heard that the Standing Committee of the Provincial Trade Union wanted to transfer cadres to them in order to grasp the central work, they would send the cadres down in advance to understand the business work of their departments. Some industrial trade unions only focused on grasping technology and business experience, but did not grasp the ideological mobilization of the workers. Some comrades were not respectful enough to the county, town, and grass-roots Party committees, and even mistakenly complained that "the Party committee does not pay attention to trade union work" when they saw that the county and town Party committees focused more on rural work. In some business departments of the Provincial Trade Union, mechanically handling affairs according to articles and regulations, not respecting the opinions of local Party committees, or not humbly listening to the opinions of city and county trade union organizations, and lacking adapting to local conditions in their work were also quite serious.

At present, the Provincial Trade Union Federation is organizing trade union cadres at all levels to debate the above-mentioned issues in order to distinguish between right and wrong, raise awareness, and enable all comrades, especially leading cadres, to firmly establish the idea that trade unions must fully accept the leadership of the Party not only in political thought but also in organization and work. To resolutely obey the unified leadership of the Party, earnestly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and closely focus on the Party's central tasks in various periods to carefully consider and arrange trade union work.

    彻底扫除各种错误思想
    确保党对工会工作的绝对领导
    江苏省工会结合整风第四阶段再次发动群众大鸣大争
    新华日报消息　江苏省工会联合会在进入整风第四阶段时，继续以工会如何完全在党领导下发挥助手作用这一根本性问题开展大鸣大放。
    在大整大改中，江苏省工会联合会对如何在党委领导下充分发挥助手作用的问题，虽然组织过群众进行鸣放和辩论，但是搞得不深不透。因此，在进入整风第四阶段之前，根据总路线的精神和全国总工会的指示进行了检查，发现部分同志，甚至某些领导骨干对工会不仅要在政治思想上，而且还要在组织上、业务上必须完全接受党的领导这一根本问题，还不十分明确或者有抵触情绪。于是，省工会联合会便确定以工会如何完全在党的领导下，充分发挥助手作用这个根本性问题，再次发动群众进行鸣放辩论，以批判错误思想，确保党对工会和工人运动的绝对领导。
    根据初步揭发的材料看来，有些同志强调工会工作的业务性和产业工作的特殊性，认为“党对工会的领导是政治思想上的领导”，在组织上、业务上工会要有“独立活动”。个别产业工会的负责同志认为：“地方工会（指省联合会）党组领导产业工会，是名不正言不顺”，甚至发展到对省工会联合会党组的意见不认真执行。如省联合会党组决定省公路运输工会要抓分散搬运工人的工作，但该产业工会个别领导同志竟借故长期没有认真执行。省教育工会个别负责同志长期以来认为“教育工会特殊，省工会党组不懂业务”，因而对党组领导表示“不感兴趣”，对省工会常委召开的会议，认为是“不去不好，去了无关”，对党的中心任务，漠不关心。有些产业工会和省工会业务部门对省工会常委会执行省委指示，组织统一工作组下去抓中心工作，向他们抽调干部时，亦有抵触情绪。如省轻工业工会和省工会宣传部有时听到省工会常委会为了抓中心工作，要向他们抽调干部时，就事先把干部派下去了解本部门的业务工作。有些产业工会只着重抓技术、业务经验，对职工群众的思想发动工作却抓得不够。某些同志对县、镇和基层党委尊重也不够，甚至看到县、镇党委抓农村工作多，就错误地埋怨“党委不重视工会工作”。在省工会的某些业务部门，机械地按条文办事，不尊重地方党委意见或不虚心听取市、县工会组织的意见，工作中缺乏因地制宜的情况也相当严重。
    目前，省工会联合会正组织各级工会干部，对上述问题进行辩论，以便通过大争大辩，分清是非，提高认识，使全体同志，特别是领导骨干牢固地树立工会不仅在政治思想上，而且在组织上和业务上，都必须完全接受党的领导的思想。做到坚决服从党的统一领导，认真贯彻执行党的方针、政策，紧密围绕党在各个时期的中心任务，来认真考虑与安排工会工作。
