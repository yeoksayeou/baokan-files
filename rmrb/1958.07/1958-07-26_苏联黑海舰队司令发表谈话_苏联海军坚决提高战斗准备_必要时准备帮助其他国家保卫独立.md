Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th: TASS, Moscow, July 24th: Soviet Black Sea Fleet Commander Kasatonov told TASS reporters that Soviet naval personnel, like all Soviet soldiers, are educated to be friendly and respectful to the people of other countries. If necessary, they are ready to help the people of other countries defend their independence and freedom.

Admiral Kasatonov made this statement in anticipation of the Soviet Navy Day, which will be celebrated on July 27th. He pointed out that the naval fleet is an important part of the Soviet armed forces.

Kasatonov reviewed the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Soviet fleet and spoke of the noble combat moral qualities of Soviet naval personnel.

The Black Sea Fleet Commander concluded by saying that the Soviet people have never forgotten that there are still imperialist aggressor forces in the world who want to plunge humanity into a new war. The recent events in the Near and Middle East particularly demonstrate this. In view of the current situation, Soviet naval personnel are demonstrating the utmost vigilance. They are constantly mastering the incredibly powerful weapons entrusted to them by the people and are resolutely improving their combat readiness. The Black Sea Fleet is participating in the military exercises of the Transcaucasian Military District that began on July 18th.
