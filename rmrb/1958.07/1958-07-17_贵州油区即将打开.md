    Guizhou Oilfield About to Open
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 16th. The Guizhou Geological Bureau's Petroleum Prospecting Brigade, drilling a deep oil well in the Bancheng Mountain structure in the suburbs of Anshun City, has struck oil and gas, forecasting the imminent opening of the Guizhou Plateau oilfield.
    The Bancheng Mountain exploration well, at 11:30 PM on July 2nd, at a depth of 760.3 meters in the Triassic limestone formation, first struck oil and gas, mixed with the fresh water injected into the exploration well, bubbling to the surface for two centimeters, turning the water dark yellow. Subsequently, until 8:00 PM on the 7th, as the exploration well continued to drill to a depth of 793.6 meters, bubbling occurred intermittently.
    This exploration well began drilling on April 5th, and the drilling work has been progressing smoothly. This oil structure is very good, with a closed area of 30 square kilometers, and is one of the structures with a high potential for oil storage.

    贵州油区即将打开
    新华社贵阳16日电　贵州地质局石油普查大队，在安顺市郊区板凳山构造钻进的一口石油深井，冒出了油气，预报贵州高原油区即将打开。
    板凳山探井，在7月2日夜间十一时三十分，井深到七百六十点三公尺处的三叠纪地层的灰岩中，第一次冒出了油气，掺和着注入探井内的清水，成为气泡冒出地面两公寸，水变成了深黄色。这以后，截至7日夜间八时，探井继续钻进到七百九十三点六公尺的过程中，都断断续续冒气泡。
    这个探井是在4月5日开始钻进的，钻井工作一直很顺利。这个石油构造很好，闭合面积为三十平方公里，是储油希望很大的构造之一。
