Tongxin County Hui People Deep-Plow the Land

    (Reported by this newspaper) In the Ningxia region, the Hui people of Tongxin County are universally carrying out deep-plowing activities. The county has already deep-plowed 150,000 mu of cultivated land, with a depth of generally over one chi (approximately 1/3 of a meter). Based on the growth of seedlings planted after deep-plowing, it is estimated that the yield per mu can increase by 20% compared to land that has not been deep-plowed.

    Tongxin County is a county inhabited by the Hui people with a vast territory and sparse population, where planting is extensive but yields are low. In the past, cultivation generally only plowed the topsoil to less than five cun (approximately 1/6 of a meter). Plowing any deeper would reveal very hard soil, which the masses called "raw soil" and would not turn over. As a result, the soil was not loose, crops did not root deeply, and yields were very low. This spring, the Hejiakouzi Agricultural Cooperative in the county advocated deep-plowing with iron shovels, which was initially opposed by many members. Some said there was insufficient labor, and others said it was too strenuous. However, in the several mu of land that cooperative cadres took the lead in deep-plowing, the planted seedlings grew vigorously, and the members then believed in the benefits of deep-plowing. After the cooperative calculated the labor, it was believed that deep-plowing could save the labor of plowing, and at the same time, this work was simple and easy to do, and men, women, young, and old could all participate, without affecting other aspects of production. In this way, the entire cooperative extracted more than 230 male and female laborers every day to deep-plow 70 to 80 mu, and in a dozen days, they deep-plowed more than 700 mu.

    The Tongxin County Committee of the Communist Party of China found that this cooperative was doing a very good job in deep-plowing and immediately made arrangements at the county's production meeting, calling on everyone to universally deep-plow the land. As a result, many cooperatives quickly took action. The county has now decided to deep-plow another 200,000 mu of land this autumn, deep-plow 500,000 mu next year, and by 1960, deep-plow all 1.2 million mu of cultivated land in the county.

    In addition, Jinji, Lingwu, Baozhong and other counties and cities have also decided to vigorously promote deep-plowing, and this year they will deep-plow all the Sichuan land.

    同心县回民深翻土地
    本报讯  宁夏地区同心县，今年回族农民普遍开展深翻地活动。全县已深翻耕地达到十五万亩，深度一般都在一尺以上。根据深翻耕地以后种植的禾苗生长情况估计，比没有深翻耕地每亩可增产20％。
    同心县是一个地广人稀，广种薄收的回族人民聚居的县，过去耕种一般只犁表土不到五寸，再深耕土质就很生硬，群众称为“生土”不翻，因此土壤不疏松，作物生根不深，产量很低。今年春天这个县贺家口子农业社提倡用铁锨深翻地，开始遭到很多社员的反对，有的人说劳力不足，有的人说这样做太费力。但是在社干部带头深翻过的几亩地里，种上的禾苗生长茁壮，社员们才相信深翻地的好处。社里经过劳力算账，认为深翻地可以省出耕犁的劳力，同时这种活简单易做，男女老少都可以上阵，并不影响其他方面的生产。这样全社每天抽出二百三十多个男女劳动力，深翻地七、八十亩，十几天的时间里就深翻地七百多亩。
    中共同心县委发现这个社深翻地很好，立即在全县的生产会议上作了布置，号召普遍深翻地，这样很多社都很快行动起来。现在这个县决定今年秋天再深翻地二十万亩，明年深翻五十万亩，到1960年把全县一百二十万亩耕地全部深翻一遍。
    另外，金积、灵武、保忠等县市也决定大力推广深翻地，今年把川地都深翻一遍。
