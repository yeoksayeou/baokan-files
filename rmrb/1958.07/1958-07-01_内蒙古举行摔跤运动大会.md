Throughout the competition, the burly Mongolian wrestlers Damuqing and Yidamu consistently held the advantage, winning the heavyweight and light-heavyweight titles in Mongolian-style wrestling, respectively. The famous wrestler Meng Yuan won the heavyweight title in Chinese-style wrestling. At this competition, a sixteen-year-old wrestling novice, Mongolian middle school student A’ridena, also attracted a lot of attention.

    内蒙古举行摔跤运动大会
    据新华社讯　在草原城市锡林浩特举行的内蒙古自治区1958年摔跤锦标赛运动大会，经过三天紧张的比赛于29日闭幕。
    这次运动会上，来自内蒙古各大草原、农村和城市的蒙古族、汉族、达斡尔族和回族等民族的八十多名摔跤运动员，都进行了精采的蒙古式和中国式摔跤表演比赛。在整个比赛中，身材魁梧的蒙古族摔跤运动员达木庆和伊达木一直占着优势，他们分别获得蒙古式摔跤重量级和次重量级冠军。著名摔跤运动员孟员获得了中国式摔跤的重量级冠军。这次运动会上，还有一位十六岁的摔跤新手、蒙古族中学生阿日德那，很引人注意。他在中国式摔跤过程中，摔倒了比他年龄大、身材高的四个对手，获得了最轻量级冠军。人们认为阿日德那摔跤轻巧有力，是最有希望的摔跤运动员。
