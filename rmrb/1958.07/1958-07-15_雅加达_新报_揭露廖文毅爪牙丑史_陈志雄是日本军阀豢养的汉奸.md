Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 14th: The Indonesian-language newspaper "New News" in Jakarta revealed on Sunday, the 13th, that Chen Zhixiong, a member of the Liao Wenyi group who is active in Jakarta as a "representative" of the American-controlled "Free Taiwan Movement," is actually a long-time traitor and rogue raised by Japanese warlords.

The newspaper said that after investigation, it was learned that Chen Zhixiong had close ties with a certain "Western" embassy in Indonesia and received funds from the embassy to carry out his activities. The newspaper did not specify which Western country's embassy, but many people here know it is the American embassy.

The newspaper said that Chen Zhixiong's ancestral home is Taiwan, and he was born in Japan. When Japanese imperialists launched a war of aggression against Southeast Asia, this traitor landed in Sumatra with the Japanese army. At that time, he was a translator for the Japanese military police. After Japan surrendered, he remained in Indonesia, working as a "broker." He has dealings with industrial and business people here. He claims to be an agent for several Japanese munitions factories. He has recently been active here under the name S.L. TAN. He also has another name called TAN MOSA MATO.

The newspaper said that Chen Zhixiong went to Japan once last year. He met Liao Wenyi, an American running dog who was engaged in the "Free Taiwan Movement." In this way, he transformed overnight into a "Special Envoy to Southeast Asia of the Republic of Taiwan."

Chen Zhixiong came to Indonesia on June 5th under the instructions of American imperialism to carry out activities.

    雅加达“新报”揭露廖文毅爪牙丑史
    陈志雄是日本军阀豢养的汉奸
    据新华社雅加达14日电　星期日的印度尼西亚文报纸“新报”13日揭露说，以美国操纵的“自由台湾运动”“代表”身份在雅加达进行活动的廖文毅集团分子陈志雄实际上是一个长期受日本军阀豢养的汉奸和流氓。
    这家报纸说，经过调查，得悉陈志雄和某一个“西方”驻印度尼西亚大使馆有着密切的联系，并且从大使馆接受资金来进行他的活动。这家报纸没有指明是哪一个西方国家的大使馆，但是这里有很多人知道是美国的大使馆。
    这家报纸说，陈志雄祖籍台湾，出生在日本。当日本帝国主义者向东南亚发动侵略战争时，这个汉奸随着日本军队在苏门答腊登陆。当时他是日本宪兵的翻译。日本投降之后他仍然留在印度尼西亚，充当“经纪人”。他和这里的工业和企业人士有交往。他自称还是好几家日本军火制造厂的代理人。他最近在这里以S·L·TAN的名字进行活动。他还有另外一个名字叫TAN MOSA MATO。
    这家报纸说，陈志雄在去年曾经到日本去过一次。他结识了美国的走卒搞“自由台湾运动”的廖文毅。就这样，他在一夜之间摇身变为“台湾共和国驻东南亚特使”。
    陈志雄是在美帝国主义的指使下，于6月5日到印度尼西亚进行活动的。
