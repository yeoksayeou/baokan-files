Xinhua News Agency, July 19th—Vienna Dispatch: The Austrian Ministry of Defense announced on the 18th that it would close its western airspace above 5,000 meters from midnight on the 19th, prohibiting all aircraft from flying; airspace below 5,000 meters would also only be open to scheduled civil aviation. This decision was made in response to the continuous violations of Austrian airspace by American military aircraft.

Prior to this, Austria had already formally protested to the United States government, accusing American aircraft of violating Austrian airspace by transporting intervention troops to the Middle East, which constituted a violation of Austrian sovereignty and neutrality.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 19th – According to a broadcast by Radio Gamal on the 18th, Saudi Arabian authorities issued an official statement denying the Western news agency reports that the Saudi King had permitted American aircraft carrying gasoline to pass through Saudi Arabian airspace en route to Jordan.

The statement said that the Saudi Arabian government hopes that such fabricated news will not affect Saudi Arabia's position on the events currently taking place in the Arab East.

Separately, news reports indicate that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman stated that the United States is currently in negotiations with Saudi Arabia, seeking permission for American refueling aircraft to fly over Saudi Arabian airspace to transport oil to British troops in Jordan.

    奥国封闭西部领空  不让美机非法过境
    沙特阿拉伯否认准许美机通过
    新华社19日讯　维也纳消息：奥地利国防部18日宣布自19日零时起封闭奥地利西部五千公尺以上的领空，禁止一切飞机飞行；五千公尺以下的领空也只向定期的民航机开放。这一决定是针对美国军用飞机不断侵犯奥地利领空而作出的。
    在这以前，奥地利已经正式向美国政府提出过抗议，指责美国飞机侵越奥国领空载运干涉军赴中东是侵犯奥地利主权和中立的行为。
    新华社开罗19日电　据加麦电台18日广播，沙特阿拉伯当局发表官方声明否认西方通讯社所报道的关于沙特国王准许美国飞机载运汽油通过沙特阿拉伯领空前往约旦的消息。
    声明说，沙特阿拉伯政府希望这种捏造的消息将不会影响沙特阿拉伯对目前阿拉伯东方发生的事件的立场。
    另外有消息说，美国国防部发言人说，美国目前正在同沙特阿拉伯谈判，设法求得许可使美国的供油飞机越过沙特阿拉伯领空把石油运给在约旦的英国军队。
