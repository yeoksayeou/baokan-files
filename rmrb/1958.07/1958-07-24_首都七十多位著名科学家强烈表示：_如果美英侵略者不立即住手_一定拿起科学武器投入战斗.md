Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: More than seventy prominent scientists in the capital gathered at the Cultural Club at 7 p.m. tonight to denounce the crimes of U.S. and British imperialism in their armed aggression against the Middle East. Every scientist who spoke at the meeting said with righteous indignation: If the U.S. and British imperialists do not stop their sinful activities of aggression in the Middle East, we scientific workers will, together with the people of the whole country, take further action to strike at the aggressors and will never give up until we achieve our goal.

Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: If the U.S. and British imperialists do not stop immediately, our scientific community will surely hold high the banner of justice and will never stand idly by.

Atomic physicist Qian Sanqiang said with indignation: The scientists present here once opposed U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and British and French imperialism's aggression against Egypt. This time, we must more forcefully support the national independence movement of the Arab people. He said that they are ready to take up scientific weapons at any time, whether on the front lines, by the microscope, or in the laboratory, to do everything in their power, just as they did in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea when they opposed imperialist germ warfare.

Chemist Wang Baoren said: I have four children, two in the Volunteer Army and two in the People's Liberation Army. If the U.S. and British imperialists dare to launch a war crazily, I, the father of four children, will also participate in the struggle against imperialism. Medical scientist Wu Chao Ren said: Our medical community has experience in organizing volunteer medical teams.

Railway bridge expert Mao Yisheng said that the U.S. and British imperialists' blatant and naked public aggression against the Middle East is intolerable. He expressed great anger at the pirate behavior of the U.S. and Britain at the meeting.

Historian Hou Wailu said that there are many mirrors in history, including the mirrors of Hitler and Mussolini, the mirror of the Korean War, and the mirror of the Egyptian War. The mirror of history is very clear: wars of aggression are bound to fail, and wars of national liberation and independence are bound to be victorious!

Botanist Lin Rong said: The U.S. and British imperialists' aggression against the Middle East has disrupted world peace. It is a continuation of imperialist aggression against Korea and Egypt. Our scientific workers must leap forward again and again, strengthen the forces for defending peace, and stir up a greater east wind to send U.S. and British imperialism into its grave.

The scientists lodged a serious protest against the rumor-mongering behavior of the Reuters correspondent in Beijing. In a report on the July 18th demonstration parade by people from all walks of life in Beijing, the Reuters correspondent in Beijing said that "almost all" of those participating in the parade were "students on vacation." Geologist Peng Qirui said: We were all participants in that demonstration parade that day. Are we students on summer vacation? Gynecology expert Lin Qiaozhi said: I myself personally handed a letter of protest to the British Chargé d'Affaires, and Zhang Yun, an anatomist who went with me, also handed over a large number of protest letters to the British Chargé d'Affaires on behalf of the workers of the Academy of Medical Sciences that day. Archaeologist Xu Xusheng said: The Reuters correspondent's report is not an error but a complete fabrication. The scientists expressed great indignation at Reuters' blatant rumor-mongering.

The scientists also decided at the meeting to write letters to progressive scientific organizations in the United States. Chen Nengkuan of the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences read out a letter written by all the scientific workers of the institute to the scientific workers of the United States and Britain, which said: "Recently, the ruling groups of your two countries, in order to safeguard the interests of a few capitalists, have made various excuses to send troops to the Middle East to interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab people. We hope that you will stand on the side of the peace-loving people of the world and unite to oppose the aggressive actions of your two governments."

Also speaking at the meeting were mathematician Duan Xuefu, chemist Fu Ying, electronics expert Jiang Shiyi, entomologist Chen Shixiang, hydraulic engineer Zhang Ren, minority language expert Fu Maoji, agronomists Sun Qu and He Jiaji, and mechanician Guo Yonghuai, among others.

The meeting ended with loud shouts of "U.S. aggressors get out of Lebanon!" "British aggressors get out of Jordan!" "U.S. aggressors get out of Taiwan!"

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of protest to U.S. and British imperialism. The letter of protest stated: U.S. and British imperialism, clinging to dying colonialism, are acting perversely, launching armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, directly threatening the Republic of Iraq, and challenging world peace. This aggressive behavior of U.S. and British imperialism fully proves that they are the primary and most vicious arch-enemies in the world today. We scientific and technological workers in Beijing have long been unable to suppress our anger towards U.S. and British imperialism. We unanimously support the statements of our government and the Soviet government. All of us scientific workers must unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and exert our greatest efforts to support the anti-aggression struggle of the people of the Middle East and resolutely denounce the towering crimes of U.S. and British imperialism's armed aggression against the Middle East. We warn the U.S. and British aggressors: If you do not immediately stop this piratical activity, we will never forgive you, and you will find your graves in the place where you committed your crimes.

    首都七十多位著名科学家强烈表示：
    如果美英侵略者不立即住手
    一定拿起科学武器投入战斗
    新华社23日讯　首都七十多位著名的科学家今晚七时在文化俱乐部集会声讨美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的罪行。在会上发言的每一个科学家都义愤填膺地说：美英帝国主义者如果再不停止侵略中东的罪恶活动，我们科学工作者就和全国人民一道以更进一步的行动来打击侵略者，而且不达目的决不罢休。
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢说：如果美英帝国主义者不立即住手，我们科学界一定高举正义的大旗，决不袖手旁观。
    原子物理学家钱三强激愤地说：我们在座的各位科学家曾在一起反对过美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，反对过英法帝国主义侵略埃及，这次我们要更加有力地支持阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动。他说，他们随时准备拿起科学武器，不论在前线、在显微镜旁或是在实验室里，都要尽一切力量，像在抗美援朝中反对帝国主义细菌战时一样地进行战斗。
    化学家王葆仁说：我有四个子女，两个在志愿军里、两个在人民解放军里，美英帝国主义如果真敢疯狂发动战争，我这个四子女的父亲也要参加和帝国主义的斗争。医学家吴朝仁说：我们医学界有组织志愿医疗队的经验。
    铁路桥梁专家茅以升说，美英帝国主义明目张胆地、赤裸裸地公开侵略中东，令人不能容忍。他在会上对美英的海盗行为表示极大的愤怒。
    史学家侯外庐说，历史上有很多面镜子，有希特勒、墨索里尼的镜子，有朝鲜战争的镜子，有埃及战争的镜子。历史的镜子很清楚，侵略战争一定要失败，民族解放独立的战争一定会胜利！
    植物学家林熔说：美英帝国主义的侵略中东的行为破坏了世界和平，它是帝国主义侵略朝鲜、侵略埃及的继续。我们科学工作者要跃进再跃进，加强保卫和平的力量，刮起更大的东风把美英帝国主义送进坟墓。
    科学家们对路透社驻北京记者的造谣行为提出了严重抗议。路透社驻北京记者在18日报道北京市各界人民示威游行时，说参加游行的
  “几乎都是放了假的学生”。地质学家彭琪瑞说：我们都是那天示威游行的参加者，难道我们是放了暑假的学生吗？妇科专家林巧稚说：我自己就曾经把一封抗议书亲自递给了英国代办处，和我一起去的解剖学家张鋆那天也代表医学科学院的工作者把大批抗议书递给了英国代办处。考古学家徐旭生说：路透社记者的报道不是错误而是完全造谣。科学家们对路透社公然造谣的恶劣行为表示了极大的愤慨。
    科学家们在会上并决定分别给美国的进步科学团体写信。中国科学院应用物理研究所陈能宽当场宣读了该所全体科学工作者写给美英科学工作者的一封信，信上说：“最近你们两国的统治集团为了维护少数资本家的利益，制造各种借口出兵到中东，干涉阿拉伯人民的内政，我们希望你们和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一边，联合起来反对你们两国政府的侵略行为。”
    在会上发言的还有数学家段学复、化学家傅鹰、电子学家蒋士騛、昆虫学家陈世骧、水利学家张任、少数民族语言学家傅懋泌、农学家孙渠、何家绩、力学家郭永怀等人。
    大会在高呼“美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去”“英国侵略军从约旦滚出去”“美国侵略军从台湾滚出去”的口号中结束。
    大会最后一致通过了向美英帝国主义的抗议书。抗议书上写道：美英帝国主义抱住垂死的殖民主义，倒行逆施，武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，直接对伊拉克共和国进行威胁，向世界和平挑战。美英帝国主义这种侵略行为，充分地证明了他们是今天世界上首要的最凶恶的头号公敌。我们北京的科学技术工作者，对美英帝国主义的愤怒心情早已抑制不住。我们一致拥护我国政府和苏联政府的声明。我们全体科学工作者一定紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，发挥最大的力量来支持中东人民的反侵略的斗争，坚决声讨美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的滔天罪行。我们警告美英侵略者：如果你们不立即停止这种海盗活动，我们决不宽恕你们，你们将在犯罪的地方找到自己的坟墓。
