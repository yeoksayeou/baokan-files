Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 10th. All over Albania, the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army was warmly celebrated today, the 10th. Heroic cities such as the capital, Tirana, and Vlora fired salutes to celebrate this important holiday. In the evening, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense, Baluku, held a grand holiday reception.

On the eve of the festival, the Albanian Ministry of Defense and the Tirana City Leadership Organs of the National Front jointly held a grand celebration. Party and government leaders such as Hoxha, Leshi, and Koleka attended the meeting. Minister of Defense Baluku delivered a report on the celebration of Army Day at the meeting. He emphasized the importance of defending peace and maintaining the solidarity of the socialist camp, and sternly condemned modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Communist leadership group.

Baluku condemned the Tito group for shamelessly obliterating the fact that the Soviet army helped liberate Yugoslavia with its own blood. He also pointed out that the revisionist leaders of Yugoslavia also obliterated the fact that Albanian guerrillas fought against the German fascist forces on Yugoslav soil and shed blood and sacrificed themselves. Baluku said, "However, we believe that the blood shed by Albanian guerrillas on the battlefield for the common cause will be remembered in the hearts of the fraternal Yugoslav people." He also pointed out that the activities of the Yugoslav Communist revisionist leaders in opposing Marxism-Leninism principles and the socialist camp are merely serving American imperialism. These people should be thoroughly exposed and isolated politically and ideologically. He said that in the face of the vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav revisionists have already been defeated in their hostile activities, and will continue to be defeated in the future.

Baluku also condemned Italy's attempt to build rocket launch installations. He said that if this measure is realized, the Albanian government, in order to defend national independence, will be forced to take measures to respond with a powerful counterattack.

    在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚建军节大会上
    巴卢库严正谴责南共修正主义
    指责铁托集团抹煞苏军帮助解放南斯拉夫的事实
    新华社地拉那10日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国各地在10日这一天热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军十五周年。首都地拉那和发罗那等英雄城市都鸣放礼炮来庆祝这一重要节日。晚间，部长会议第一副主席兼国防部长巴卢库举行了盛大的节日招待会。
    在节日前夕，阿尔巴尼亚国防部和民族阵线地拉那市领导机关联合举行了盛大庆祝会。霍查、列希、科列加等党政领导人参加了大会。国防部长巴卢库在大会上作了关于庆祝建军节的报告。他强调了保卫和平和维护社会主义阵营团结的重要性，并且严正谴责了以南共领导集团为代表的现代修正主义。
    巴卢库谴责铁托集团无耻抹煞苏联军队用自己的鲜血帮助解放南斯拉夫的事实。他还指出，南斯拉夫的修正主义领导也抹煞了阿尔巴尼亚游击队员在南斯拉夫土地上抗击德国法西斯武装、流血牺牲的事实。巴卢库说，“可是，我们相信，阿尔巴尼亚游击队员为了共同的事业在战场上所流的鲜血，将记在兄弟的南斯拉夫人民的心里。”他还指出，南共的修正主义领导人敌视马克思列宁主义原则和社会主义阵营的活动只不过是为美国帝国主义效劳。应该在政治上和思想上彻底揭露和孤立这些人。他说，在马克思列宁主义思想的活力和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结面前，南斯拉夫的修正主义者在其敌对活动中已经遭到失败，今后还要继续失败。
    巴卢库还谴责了意大利阴谋建立火箭发射装置的企图。他说，这一措施如果实现，阿尔巴尼亚政府为了保卫民族独立，就将被迫采取措施，用强有力的反击给予回答。
