    Strange Passenger
    One afternoon, Chen Jianzeng, a member of the Xiaqi Fishery Cooperative in Fujian and a militiaman, sailed his boat to Luojiang Village and stopped to look for the passenger who had hired him that morning to go to Dongchong. There were many passengers on the boat, and when this new passenger saw them, he lowered his head and crawled from the stern into the cabin, lay down, and even asked the boat owner for a piece of bamboo mat to cover himself.
    This passenger's actions quickly attracted Chen Jianzeng's attention. Some time ago, public security personnel had been publicizing the strengthening of the struggle against the enemy along the coast, and the resounding slogan of "Defend the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and don't let the enemy go up the mountains or into the sea" floated in his mind again.
    At eight o'clock in the evening, the boat arrived at Xiabaishi, and all the passengers went ashore. Only the new passenger was going to Dongchong. When this passenger went ashore to eat, Chen Jianzeng suddenly saw a letter signed Zheng Songling where he had been lying. It contained abuse of the Party and the government, as well as words like "plunging into the sea to be reborn." Chen Jianzeng's heart skipped a beat, and he was sure that this passenger was no good.
    At eleven o'clock the next day, the boat arrived at Dongchong, Xiapu. The man suddenly said to Chen Jianzeng, "Please stop the boat here for a while, there are a few more people up there who want to hire your boat with me to go somewhere else." After saying that, he hurried ashore. Chen Jianzeng thought, could this guy be trying to slip away? After he went ashore, he followed him ashore to monitor his actions. Who knew that the guy only bought a pack of cigarettes and turned back. When he got to the boat, he said to Chen Jianzeng, "I am ordered by the government to go to Nangantang with a few comrades to work, preparing to cooperate in the liberation of Taiwan. Now they have left, so I have to go alone..." Chen Jianzeng asked him, "Does the government have proof that they want you to go to Nangantang?" The man said, "My uncle is on the island, the government allows me to go, just take me there..."
    At this point, Chen Jianzeng completely understood that this person was a counter-revolutionary element attempting to defect to the enemy by sea. He had a flash of inspiration, deliberately looked at the sky, and shouted to his wife, "The wind is picking up, hurry up and hoist the sail, bring the rope!". His wife immediately handed him the rope. Chen Jianzeng took the rope, jumped in front of the guy in one stride, pounced and pressed the guy down on the cabin floor, and the couple tied him up tightly.
    It turned out that this counter-revolutionary element who attempted to defect to the enemy by sea was named Luo Bingshan. He accepted instructions from sea bandits to carry out sabotage activities. The public security organs also found a package of two taels of arsenic in his luggage.

    奇怪的乘客
    一天下午，福建下岐渔业社社员、民兵陈建增的船开到了罗江村停下来，上岸去找早晨向他雇船去东冲的那个乘客。船上乘客很多，这个新来的乘客一看，便低着头从船尾爬进仓，躺下来，还向船主要一片竹篷遮在身上。
    这个乘客的行动，很快就引起陈建增的注意。前些日子，公安人员宣传加强沿海对敌斗争，“保卫工农业大跃进，不让敌人上山、下海”的响亮口号，又在他脑海里浮旋起来。
    晚上八时，船到了下白石，客人全都上岸了。去东冲的只有那个新乘客。当这个乘客上岸吃饭的时候，陈建增突然在他原先躺着的地方看到一封署名郑松铃的信，那上面谩骂党和政府，还有“下海投生”等字样。陈建增心里一跳，肯定这个乘客不是好东西。
    第二天中午十一时，船到霞浦东冲。那个人突然对陈建增说：“请把船停在这里等一会儿，上面还有几个人要同我一起再雇你的船到别的地方去。”说完便匆匆上岸了。陈建增心想这家伙莫非想溜？等他上岸后，自己也跟着上岸监视他的行动。谁知道那家伙上岸去只买了包香烟就回头了。他到船上，便对陈建增说：“我奉政府命令和几个同志一起去南竿塘做工作，准备配合解放台湾。现在他们已经走了，我只好自己一个人去……”陈建增问他：“政府要你去南竿塘，有没有证明？”那个人说：“我舅父在海岛，政府允许我去，你只管把我送去好了……。”
    这一下，陈建增完全明白这个人是个企图下海投敌的反革命分子。他灵机一动，故意望望天空，向妻子喊道：“对风了，快上帆，把绳子拿来！”。他妻子马上把绳子递给他。陈建增接过绳子，一个箭步跳到那个家伙面前，猛一扑把那家伙按倒仓面，夫妻俩结结实实地把他捆起来了。
    原来这个企图下海投敌的反革命分子名叫罗炳珊，接受海匪指示进行破坏活动，公安机关在他的包袱里还查出一包二两重的砒霜。
