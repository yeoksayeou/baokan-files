Shandong's Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, Students, and Businessmen Unite to Grasp Steel
Provincial-Level Cadres Participate in Voluntary Labor to Build Iron Smelting Experimental Fields

(Our newspaper's Jinan dispatch, July 15th) The mass movement of Shandong Province to run the iron and steel industry is progressing rapidly. As of July 11th, the province has built 1,804 small-scale iron smelting furnaces, of which 910 have been put into production.

A surge of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businessmen grasping steel together has emerged in various parts of Shandong. Zibo City, by tightly focusing on the method of building furnaces mainly with "pig snout" furnaces (each of these furnaces only costs a few dozen yuan and can be built in one or two days), has recently built more than 300 various iron smelting furnaces. Yidu, Laiyang, Junan, as well as Jinan, Weifang, Weihai and other counties and cities have successively produced iron. Triumphant news of successful steelmaking is also frequently reported. A two-ton alkaline converter with a revolving drum capable of producing 20,000 tons of steel per year, manufactured by the Jinan Locomotive Repair Factory, and a steel rolling mill capable of rolling 20,000 tons of steel per year, recently produced their first heat of molten steel and rolled their first steel bar. Sili Street Office in Jinan City organized various residents' committees to overcome difficulties such as the lack of raw materials and equipment in every possible way, built a small earthen furnace in one morning, and smelted more than 26 jin of pig iron. The Jiaozhou Salt Affairs Bureau, the sauce gardens of Zibo and Zhoucun, and some barbershops in Qingdao have also begun or are preparing to engage in indigenous iron smelting.

In order to promote the great development of the iron and steel industry, various departments and bureaus of the Shandong Provincial People's Committee have decided to jointly establish iron smelting "experimental fields" - two small blast furnaces of 3.3 cubic meters, and are currently preparing materials and construction. From provincial leaders to civil servants, all actively participate in voluntary labor on the construction site, striving to put them into production on "August 1st."

    山东工农兵学商一齐来抓钢
    省级机关干部参加义务劳动建炼铁试验田
    本报济南15日电　山东省全民办钢铁工业的运动进展迅速。到7月11日止，全省已经建成小型炼铁炉一千八百零四个，其中九百一十个已经投入生产。
    山东各地已经出现了工农兵学商一起抓钢铁的热潮。淄博市由于紧紧抓住了以猪嘴炉（这种炉每个只需花钱几十元，一两天即可建成）为主的建炉办法，最近已建成各种炼铁炉三百多个。益都、莱阳、莒南以及济宁、潍坊、威海等县、市都已先后炼出铁来。炼钢成功的捷报也频频传来。济南机车修理厂制造的一座年产两万吨钢的碱性涡鼓转炉和一台年轧两万吨钢材的轧钢机，已经在最近炼出了第一炉钢水和轧出了第一根钢材。济南市司里街办事处组织各居民委员会，千方百计地克服了没有原材料、设备等困难，在一个上午就建成一座小土炉，炼出了二十六斤多生铁。胶州盐务局、淄博、周村的酱园、青岛有的理发店也已着手或准备搞土法炼铁。
    为了促使钢铁工业大发展，山东省人民委员会各厅、局已经确定联合建立炼铁“试验田”——三点三立方公尺的小高炉两座，目前正在备料、施工。上至省的负责人，下至公务员，都积极参加工地的义务劳动，争取在“八一”投入生产。
