    Pay Attention to the Body Temperature of Ducklings

    When raising ducklings, special attention should be paid to temperature. Ducklings' body temperature is slightly higher than that of humans, but it should not be too high. The duck shed should be dry and clean, with good ventilation and sunlight. Ducklings like to huddle together when they sleep, and if there are many ducklings, they can pile up to nearly a foot high. This can easily cause their body temperature to become too high. If ducks get too hot, they are prone to illness from sweating, and it is difficult for them to develop properly. A sign of overheating is that the feathers are fiery red and not moist. If they are already overheated, feed them more maggots and let them be more active in the water. However, ducklings should not be exposed to the cold either. When the weather is cool, pay attention to keeping them warm, and do not let them be rained on when swimming outside. A sign of catching a cold is "sneezing," making strange noises, and often scratching the nostrils with their toes. If this happens, add more warming foods such as dog meat and mutton.

    Around one month later, they will grow large feathers, which we call "growing red feathers." During this stage, special attention should be paid to avoid exposure to cold, and they should not be allowed to come into contact with anything that carries a plague. At this time, "red feather plague" is a major threat.

    After the "growing red feathers" stage, there are fewer problems.

    I started raising ducks at the age of seven. What I have written in this article is based on empirical knowledge and is limited to the local area (Jiangsu). It is for reference only.

### 要注意雏鸭的体温

    要注意雏鸭的体温
    饲养雏鸭应该特别注意温度。小鸭体温比人稍高，但不能高得太多。鸭棚应注意干燥清洁，通风有阳光照射。小鸭睡觉时最喜欢堆在一起，如果小鸭很多，可堆到近尺高。这样容易使它们体温过高。鸭子受热，一来出汗易病，二来难于发育。受热的象征是毛发火红色，不滋润。如已发热应多喂蛆虫，并让它们多在水中活动。但鸭子也不能受凉，天气凉时应注意保温，出外游水时，不要让雷雨淋。受凉的象征是“打喷嚏”，发出怪音，常用足趾抓鼻孔。如遇这种现象，应多加狗肉羊肉等暖性食物。
    大概一月以后，它们就要长出大毛，我们称为“出红毛”。这一阶段应特别注意不要受凉，也不能让它们沾染带有瘟疫性的东西。这时“红毛瘟”是重大的威胁。
    过了出红毛这阶段以后，问题就不大了。
    我七岁开始放鸭，本文所写皆为感性知识，且有地方（江苏）局限性，仅供参考。
