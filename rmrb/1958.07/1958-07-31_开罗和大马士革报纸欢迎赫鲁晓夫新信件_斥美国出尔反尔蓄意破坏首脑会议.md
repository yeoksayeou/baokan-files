Xinhua News Agency, July 29th dispatch from TASS, Cairo: The proposal to convene a government summit meeting continues to attract the attention of the Arab public. The Arab people warmly support the Soviet Union's efforts to convene a government summit in order to take urgent measures to stop the armed conflict in the Middle East. The Arab United Republic welcomes with great interest Khrushchev's new letters to Eisenhower, Macmillan, and De Gaulle. Cairo newspapers carried detailed summaries of these letters on the front page. The headlines of the newspapers emphasized that the Soviet Union once again firmly demanded the convening of a high-level meeting.

The newspapers also emphasized in their headlines that the American ruling groups were obstructing the convening of this meeting.

"Al-Ahram" wrote in its headline that the United States is delaying the high-level meeting, ignoring the danger of the situation in the Near East.

When publishing a summary of Khrushchev's letter, "Al-Gomhouria" pointed out that Western countries are continuing to implement their imperialist policies in the Near East.

"Al-Akhbar" said that Khrushchev's new letter is a warning to the West against attempting military intervention in Iraq.

While condemning the United States for its delaying tactics on the issue of convening a high-level meeting, the newspapers pointed out that the US government has now abandoned the proposition it agreed to yesterday and is clearly unwilling to convene the meeting. At the same time, the newspapers emphasized that the Soviet Union firmly demands the convening of a government summit.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 29th: Damascus' "Al Nasr" newspaper commented today on the third letter from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev to US President Eisenhower regarding the summit meeting, saying, "If the summit meeting cannot be convened, the United States and Britain will be responsible for the deterioration of the situation."

Referring to the United States' plot to obstruct the convening of the summit, "Al Nasr" also said, "In view of repeated failures and repeated astonishing things, it should be time for Washington to put away Dulles' tricks."

The newspaper pointed out that the United States and Britain cling to the antiquated and outdated principle of refusing to hold any peace conferences and continuing to seek opportunities for conspiracies and attacks, thereby making the Middle East region a "cold war" area. It said that Khrushchev had "shown such magnanimity that the whole world will only be surprised if a meeting is not held soon or a reasonable result is not achieved."

Commenting on the same issue today, "Al Ayam" said, "Anyone can see the serious crimes committed by the imperialist countries against world security and the Soviet Union's peace policy, which enables the Soviet Union to put the criminals before the people of the whole world."

    开罗和大马士革报纸欢迎赫鲁晓夫新信件
    斥美国出尔反尔蓄意破坏首脑会议
    新华社29日讯　塔斯社开罗29日讯：召开政府首脑会议的主张仍然吸引着阿拉伯公众的注意。阿拉伯人民热烈拥护苏联为争取召开政府首脑会议以采取紧急措施停止在中东的武装冲突所作的努力。阿拉伯联合共和国以极大的兴趣欢迎赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐的新的信件。开罗各报在第一栏刊载了这个信件的详细摘要。各报标题中强调指出，苏联再一次坚决要求召开高级会议。
    各报还在标题中强调指出，美国统治集团阻挠召开这个会议。
      “金字塔报”在标题中写道，美国拖延高级会议，无视近东局势的危险。
      “共和国报”刊载赫鲁晓夫信件的摘要时指出，西方国家继续在近东实行它们的帝国主义政策。
    “消息报”说，赫鲁晓夫新的信件是警告西方不要妄图对伊拉克进行军事干涉。
    报纸在谴责美国在召开高级会议问题上所实行的拖延政策时指出，美国政府现在放弃了昨天它所同意的主张，显然不愿召开会议。同时报纸强调指出，苏联坚决要求召开政府首脑会议。
    新华社大马士革29日电　大马士革“胜利报”今天在评论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫致美国总统艾森豪威尔的关于最高级会议的第三封信时说，“如果最高级会议不能召开的话，美英要对局势恶化负责。”
    “胜利报”在提到美国阻挠召开最高级会议的阴谋时又说，“鉴于一再失败和一再作出令人吃惊的事情，这应该是华盛顿收起杜勒斯的那一套的时候了”。
    这家报纸指出，美英死抱住拒绝举行任何和平会议和继续伺机进行阴谋和攻击，从而使中东地区成为“冷战”地区的陈腐和过时的原则。它说，赫鲁晓夫已经“表示了这样的宽大为怀，以致如果不很快举行会议或不取得合理的结果的话，全世界将只会感到惊奇”。
    “旷野报”今天在评论同一个问题时说，“任何人都可以看到帝国主义国家对世界安全和苏联的和平政策所犯下的重大罪行，这就使苏联能够把罪犯放在全世界人民的眼前。
