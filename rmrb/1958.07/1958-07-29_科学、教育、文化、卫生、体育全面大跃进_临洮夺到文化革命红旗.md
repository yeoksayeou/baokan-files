Lintao Wins the Red Flag of Cultural Revolution

According to the Gansu Daily, Lintao County in Gansu Province has won the advanced red flag in the cultural revolution. Based on its past work, and after several months of hard struggle, the county has swept away its backward cultural state and leaped to become the first cultural county in Gansu Province.

A comprehensive leap forward in science, education, culture, health, and sports is the basic characteristic of Lintao County's cultural revolution. Currently, 97% of the young and middle-aged people in Lintao County have shed their illiteracy. The county has established 965 amateur higher primary school classes and 31 amateur middle school classes, with more than 51,400 young and middle-aged people enrolled. The county has universalized primary, secondary, and preschool education, with 97% of school-age children enrolled. It has established 43 vocational middle schools and 10 ordinary middle schools. Adding to the existing middle schools, all this year's higher primary school graduates can be admitted to middle school. While consolidating and improving the existing public middle schools, the Special District and the county are establishing an agricultural college, a teachers' college, and an evening university. In terms of preschool education, the county has organized 1,249 nurseries and 129 kindergartens. It has basically achieved the goal of having a middle school and a kindergarten in every township, a primary school in every commune, a child-minding group in every team, and a university in the county. The county has eliminated rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, lice, fleas, bedbugs, wild rabbits, phlebotomus flies and wolves, which endanger people's health. It has achieved cleanliness in every home, hygiene in every household, and a fresh and clean environment in both rural and urban areas. The county has a people's hospital, an epidemic prevention station, and a health center. Every township has a rural hospital, and every commune has a health station. Each commune basically has a health worker, an epidemic prevention worker, and a midwife. Currently, Lintao County has a cultural center, and the townships have people-run cultural stations. Every commune has a club, an amateur theater troupe, and a literary and artistic group. The county has established 193 libraries, 62 music transmission stations, 326 singing groups, 34 amateur drama writing groups, 29 fine arts research groups, 4 cultural relic protection groups, and 101 reading groups. Every township has telephone access, and basically every commune has a loudspeaker. Under the call of "the whole party runs newspapers, the whole people run newspapers, everyone writes articles, everyone is a writer," the county has established 248 communication groups and developed 2,150 correspondents. It has achieved the goal of every household having a newspaper, every commune having a newspaper reading group, and every team having a blackboard newspaper. The county, townships, and communes all have science popularization associations or science popularization work groups. Every commune has established an agricultural technology research group, and government offices, factories, and schools all have scientific and technological research organizations. Every township and commune has a sports field. Basketball and table tennis have become the most popular activities among farmers.

Currently, Lintao County has formed a network of farmers' amateur education, a network of school education, a network of health care, and a network of cultural propaganda, which has effectively promoted technological revolution and boosted the development of productive forces.

At present, Lintao County is showing a thriving scene everywhere. In the past, people used to visit each other or chat when they were free. Now, whenever they have time, there are sounds of reading and singing everywhere. The elderly people in the Haoshui Commune of Shangying Township said with satisfaction: "You can't find anyone idle, everywhere you hear the sound of reading."
