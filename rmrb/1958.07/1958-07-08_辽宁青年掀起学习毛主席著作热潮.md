    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th: A great upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works and philosophy has been launched by the broad masses of Communist Youth League members and young workers in Liaoning Province. According to incomplete statistics from only ten cities including Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, and Tieling, and four prefectural committees, more than 2,600 study groups on Chairman Mao's works and philosophy have been established, with over 50,000 people participating in the study.
    After the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the political consciousness of young workers has greatly improved, and their enthusiasm for caring about politics and studying Marxism-Leninism has soared to an unprecedented level. Especially under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, they have broken away from the mysterious view of studying theory and actively launched an upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works. In many factories, young workers have spontaneously organized study groups to study more than 30 articles of Chairman Mao's works, including "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and relevant articles published in "Red Flag." They said: Chairman Mao is the representative of truth, and Chairman Mao's works are a model of combining theory with practice. We must arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thought, improve our understanding, transform our way of thinking, and establish a communist style. As of now, Benxi City has organized 467 study groups, with 3,532 people participating. In order to guide the youth of the city in their studies, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has formed a guiding group for studying Chairman Mao's works, led by the secretary. Young workers at the Shenyang State-owned Liming Machinery Factory organized 81 philosophy study groups as early as February this year, with 781 people participating, and have persisted in their studies. Under their influence, more than 50% of the young people in the factory have now been drawn into the upsurge of studying the "Red Flag" magazine. After the establishment of the Communist Youth League branch in the Finished Products Workshop of the Fushun Electric Porcelain Factory, it organized a philosophy lecture every morning from 6:00 to 7:00, which was very popular among the workers. In addition to the 60 League members who participated, many young and old workers also actively participated in the study. During the study, they all combined theory with their own thoughts, production, and work practices to展开 discussion.

    辽宁青年掀起学习毛主席著作热潮
    新华社沈阳7日电  辽宁省广大共青团员和青年职工掀起了一个学习毛主席著作和哲学的高潮。仅沈阳、旅大、安东、铁岭等十个市和四个地委的不完全统计，目前已建立毛主席著作和哲学学习小组两千六百多个，参加学习的在五万人以上。
    经过整风和反右派斗争，青年职工的政治觉悟大大提高，关心政治，学习马列主义的热情空前高涨，特别是在社会主义建设总路线的指引下，打破了学习理论的神秘观点，积极地开展了学习毛主席著作的热潮。各地许多工厂青年职工们，自动组织学习小组，学习毛主席著作的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“矛盾论”、“实践论”和“红旗”上有关的文章共三十几篇。他们说：毛主席是真理的代表，毛主席的著作是理论结合实际的典范，要以毛主席的思想武装我们的头脑，提高认识，改造思想方法，树立共产主义的风格。本溪市到目前为止，已组织了四百六十七个学习小组，有三千五百三十二人参加。为了辅导全市青年学习，共青团本溪市委由书记带头组成了学习毛主席著作指导小组。沈阳国营黎明机械厂青年职工早在今年2月就组织了八十一个哲学学习小组，有七百八十一人参加，一直坚持学习。在他们影响下，目前全厂50％以上的青年已卷入学习“红旗”杂志的热潮。抚顺电瓷厂成品车间共青团支部，在学习小组成立后，每天早上从六点到七点组织了哲学讲座，很受职工欢迎。除六十名团员参加外，许多青年和老年职工也积极参加学习。在学习当中，他们都结合理论，联系思想，联系生产和工作实际展开了讨论。
