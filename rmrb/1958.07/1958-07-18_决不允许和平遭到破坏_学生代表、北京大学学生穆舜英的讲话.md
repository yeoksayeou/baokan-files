Absolutely No Disruption of Peace Allowed
Speech by Student Representative, Mu Shunying, Peking University Student

Comrades:

Just as we are celebrating the great victory of the Iraqi people, the heinous American imperialism has once again extended its bloody hand, sending troops to invade Lebanon. This is a provocation to all Arab people, a provocation to the people of the world. We will absolutely not allow peace to be disrupted. No invasion of Lebanon! No invasion of the Arab people! The American aggressors must immediately get out of Lebanon! Must get out of our territory of Taiwan! Must get out of Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines!

The victory of the national independence movement in Iraq, the uprising of the Lebanese people, makes us see more clearly that the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations in the world are developing vigorously, and the day of the final demise of imperialism is not far away. Whether it likes it or not, the torrent of history is unstoppable, and victory will surely belong to the people who are fighting for national independence and liberation.

American imperialism is panicked, trembling, and angry in the face of the people's victory, revealing the ferocious face of a jackal, and it does not hesitate to risk armed invasion of Lebanon, attempting to save its precarious position in Asia and Africa.

We warn American imperialism that armed intervention will not intimidate the Arab people, nor will it intimidate the people of the world. We love peace, but we are never afraid of war, and peace can only be won through struggle.

We have fought with American imperialism, and it is a thorough paper tiger. Its shameful defeat in the Korean War is one proof, and the victory of the Egyptian and Syrian people's struggles is another proof. The days when imperialism called the shots are long gone. Today's world situation is: the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and glorious victory will surely belong to the people of all countries who are fighting for national independence and liberation.

In the struggle against imperialism, we Chinese youth and the youth of Arab countries are holding hands, heart to heart. Your struggle is our struggle; your victory is our victory. We firmly stand with you.

Let us shout:

No interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries!

American imperialism get out of Lebanon!

Long live the victory of the national independence movements in Asia and Africa!

Oppose imperialist aggression!

Defend world peace!

### 决不允许和平遭到破坏  学生代表、北京大学学生穆舜英的讲话

    决不允许和平遭到破坏
    学生代表、北京大学学生穆舜英的讲话同志们：
    正当我们在欢庆伊拉克人民的伟大胜利的时候，万恶的美帝国主义又伸出了它的血手，派兵侵略了黎巴嫩，这是向全体阿拉伯人民的挑衅，向全世界人民的挑衅。我们决不允许和平遭到破坏。不许侵略黎巴嫩！不许侵略阿拉伯人民！美国侵略军必须立即从黎巴嫩滚出去！必须从我国领土台湾滚出去！必须从朝鲜滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！
    伊拉克民族独立运动的胜利，黎巴嫩人民的起义，使我们更清楚地看到：全世界所有被压迫民族的解放斗争，正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着，帝国主义最后灭亡的日子已经不远了。不管它喜欢不喜欢，历史的洪流是阻挡不住的，胜利一定属于为民族独立解放而斗争的人民。
    美帝国主义在人民胜利的面前惊慌了，发抖了，恼怒了，露出了豺狼的狰狞面目，竟不惜冒险武装侵略黎巴嫩，妄图挽救它在亚非摇摇欲坠的地位。
    我们警告美帝国主义，武装干涉吓不倒阿拉伯人民，吓不倒全世界人民。我们热爱和平，但我们决不害怕战争，和平只能用斗争来争取。
    我们和美帝国主义较量过，它是一个彻头彻尾的纸老虎，它在侵朝战争中的可耻的失败下场是一个证明，埃及、叙利亚人民斗争的胜利又是一个证明，帝国主义称王称霸的日子早已一去不复返了。今天的世界形势是：东风已经压倒了西风，光荣的胜利必定属于为争取民族独立解放而斗争的各国人民。
    在反对帝国主义的斗争中，我们中国青年和阿拉伯各国青年手牵着手，心连着心。你们的斗争，就是我们的斗争；你们的胜利，就是我们的胜利。我们坚决和你们站在一起。
    让我们高呼：
    不许干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政！
    美帝国主义滚出黎巴嫩！
    亚非各国的民族独立运动的胜利万岁！
    反对帝国主义侵略！
    保卫世界和平！
