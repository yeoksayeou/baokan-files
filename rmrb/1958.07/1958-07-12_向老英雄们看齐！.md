    Learn From the Old Heroes!
    After reading your newspaper's June 25th report about central leading comrades participating in labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir, we were exceptionally excited and moved. Many comrades shouted from the bottom of their hearts: "Learn from the old heroes!" "Salute our beloved Premier—the ordinary worker!" After dinner, as if someone had specifically arranged it, everyone read and reread "They Are Ordinary Workers," that inspiring article, over and over again. Little Liu even cut out the photo of the Premier valiantly advancing while holding the red flag and pasted it squarely on the first page of his diary.
    I continuously read "They Are Ordinary Workers" five times, becoming more and more excited and energized with each reading. I not only saw the great communist style and high level of labor enthusiasm of the Premier, ministers, directors, and bureau chiefs in the article, but more importantly, I realized how close, united, flesh-and-blood, and unique in the world the relationship between leaders and those led under the leadership of Chairman Mao is. The Premier, representing thousands of leaders, stated the long-practiced relationship between leaders and those led: "Here, there are no leaders, no positions of Premier or bureau director. Here, everyone is an ordinary worker." Isn't that right? In our motherland's vast construction fields, everyone is a worker, everyone is a master, and there is no difference between superiors and subordinates, only different labor posts. However, those right-wing elements and reactionary propagandists of capitalism falsely claim that there is a lack of equality, that there are gaps and walls, and that the socialist system will inevitably produce bureaucrats. Please, those gentlemen who close their eyes to the facts should take a good look at the People's Daily of June 25th!

专栏：读报感想

    向老英雄们看齐！
    你报6月25日关于中央领导同志参加十三陵水库劳动的报道，我们读了以后，格外兴奋和感动。不少同志从心眼里喊出：“向老英雄们看齐！”“向我们敬爱的总理——普通的劳动者致敬！”吃过饭后，好像有人专门布置过一样，大家都不约而同一遍再一遍地读着“他们是普通劳动者”那篇激动人心的文章。小刘还把总理高举红旗英勇前进的照片剪下来，方方正正地贴在他日记本的第一页上。
    “他们是普通劳动者”这篇短短的文章，我一连续了五遍，愈读愈兴奋，愈读愈有劲。不仅从文章中看到了总理、部长、主任、司长们的伟大的共产主义风格和高度的劳动热忱，更重要的是体会到在毛主席领导下的领导者与被领导者的关系，是何等的亲密无间，是何等的团结一致，是何等的骨肉相连，是何等的中外少有。总理代表千万个领导者道出了实行已久的、领导者与被领导者的关系：“这里没有首长，没有总理、司局长的职务。在这里大家都是普通劳动者。”不是吗，在我们祖国广大的建设园地里，人人都是劳动者，人人都是主人，上下没有一点差别，只是劳动岗位不同而已。可是，那些右派分子和资本主义的反动宣传家们，胡说什么缺少平等，有沟、有墙，胡说什么社会主义制度将不可免地产生官僚主义者。请那些闭眼不看事实的先生们好好的看看6月25日的人民日报吧！
