Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 1st: The Dominican government notified the Council of the Organization of American States on June 30 that the Dominican National Assembly had passed a resolution recommending the abolition of treaties signed between the Dominican Republic and the United States. The National Assembly's resolution was passed in mid-June. It is reported that the treaties recommended for abolition include agreements on the United States providing military "assistance" to the Dominican Republic, the Dominican Republic providing facilities for the United States to test missiles, and the two countries carrying out "cooperation" in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as well as various agreements related to U.S. technical assistance.

The Dominican Republic's Trujillo government, supported by the United States, took this action after a series of disputes with the U.S. authorities. For many years, the Dominican Republic has been under the political and economic control of the United States.

    多米尼加和美国发生争吵要废除同美国签订的条约
    新华社1日讯华盛顿消息：多米尼加政府已经在6月30日通知美洲国家组织理事会说：多米尼加国民大会已经通过决议，建议废除多米尼加和美国所签订的条约。国民大会的决议是6月中旬通过的。据报道，建议废除的条约包括关于美国给予多米尼加军事“援助”、多米尼加为美国试验导弹提供便利条件以及在和平利用核能方面两国实行“合作”的协定，还有有关美国给予技术援助的各种协定。
    受美国支持的多米尼加特鲁希略政府是在它同美国当局发生一系列争吵之后采取这个行动的。多年来，多米尼加在政治和经济上一直处在美国的控制下。
