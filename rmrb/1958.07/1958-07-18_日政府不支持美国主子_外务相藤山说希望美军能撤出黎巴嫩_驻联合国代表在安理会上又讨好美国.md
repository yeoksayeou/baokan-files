Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 17th: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said at a press conference today that Britain's military actions in Jordan may exacerbate the crisis in the Middle East. Chief Cabinet Secretary Munenori Akagi told reporters that the Japanese government opposes foreign intervention in Iraq and the dispatch of "police forces" by the United Nations.

On the same day, Aiichiro Fujiyama, on behalf of the Japanese government, issued a statement on the Lebanese issue, saying that the Japanese government is concerned that the U.S. military intervention in Lebanon may make it difficult to resolve the matter peacefully. Therefore, Japan hopes that relevant countries in the United Nations will cooperate and take appropriate measures to ensure that the matter can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, guaranteeing Lebanon's independence and territorial integrity, and at the same time allowing us to see the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

However, on the other hand, Japan's representative to the United Nations, Yasushi Matsudaira, said in the Security Council on the 16th that Japan would vote "with reservations" in support of the U.S. proposal to establish a "United Nations police force" to be sent to Lebanon. The "reservations" raised by Matsudaira do not affect the substance of the U.S. proposal to "legitimize" the U.S. armed intervention in Lebanon. Matsudaira also described the U.S. attempt to steal the UN flag and invade Lebanon as "very reasonable."

The contradictory attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government on the Middle East issue illustrates its two-pronged approach of trying to please the United States while continuing to win over Asian and African countries with a "Asia-Africa stance". The Kishi Nobusuke government hopes that a stable situation will emerge in the Middle East, stemming from the interests of Japanese monopoly capital groups expanding into the Middle East. According to Kyodo News Agency on the 16th, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials believe that the situation in Lebanon may develop into a war on a larger scale than the Suez Canal crisis. If this happens, Japan's trade with Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Republic, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern countries will inevitably be interrupted, leaving no way to cope.

    日政府不支持美国主子
    外务相藤山说希望美军能撤出黎巴嫩
    驻联合国代表在安理会上又讨好美国
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎今天在记者招待会上说，英国在约旦的军事行动可能使中东的危机恶化。日本内阁官房长官赤城宗德曾经向记者发表谈话说，日本政府反对外国干涉伊拉克，也反对联合国派遣“警察部队”等行动。
    同一天，藤山爱一郎代表日本政府对黎巴嫩问题发表谈话说，日本政府担心美国出兵黎巴嫩可能反而使事情难以得到和平解决。因此，日本希望在联合国中有关的国家实行合作，采取适当的措施，使事情能够早日得到和平解决，保证黎巴嫩的独立和领土完整，同时让我们看到美军撤退。
    但是，另一方面，日本驻联合国代表松平康东16日却在安全理事会上说，日本将“有保留地”投票支持美国提出的成立一支派往黎巴嫩的“联合国警察部队”的提案。松平所提出来的“保留”意见并不影响美国提案中使美国武装干涉黎巴嫩“合法化”的实质。松平并且把美国企图盗用联合国旗帜侵略黎巴嫩的行为说成是“十分合理的”。
    岸信介政府在中东问题上的矛盾态度，说明它在采取既想讨好美国又想用“亚非立场”来继续拉拢亚非国家的两面手法。岸信介政府希望中近东能够出现稳定的局面，是从日本垄断资本集团向中近东扩张的利益出发的。据共同社16日透露，日本外务省人士认为：黎巴嫩的局势有可能发展成为比苏伊士运河事件更大规模的战争。如果这样，日本同伊拉克、约旦、沙特阿拉伯、阿拉伯联合共和国、黎巴嫩等中近东各国的贸易必然会陷入中断状态，毫无应付办法。
