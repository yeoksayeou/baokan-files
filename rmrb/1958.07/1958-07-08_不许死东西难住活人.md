    Don't Let Dead Things Stump the Living
    Our factory's forging workshop uses two American-made clamping hammers. The thin wooden boards on the hammer head supports break once or twice, sometimes three or four times, every day. Whenever a wooden board breaks, the fitter has to rush to the top of the hammer to repair it. Each repair requires about an hour of downtime. The forging workshop forges nearly 100 tons of automobile forgings every day, all of which have to wait for these two clamping hammers to be corrected before being sent to other workshops for processing. The wooden boards of the clamping hammers break every day, and the forgings cannot be corrected on time, which seriously affects production efficiency. Fitter Hu Yumin had to climb to the top of the hammer to repair the wooden boards three or four times a day, getting so angry he was fuming. Unwilling to be stumped by these two dead things, he decided to改造 (transform) them.
    At first, they tried replacing the wooden boards on the hammer head supports with iron plates, but it didn't work. They then switched to asbestos-copper plates. After testing, the degree of softness was the same as the wooden boards. So, they proposed using asbestos-copper plates instead of wooden boards. Finally, with the assistance of Machinist Qin, they used low-carbon soft steel as the core, asbestos-copper plates as the outer layer, and firmly riveted them with copper rivets, finally creating a clamping plate that was solid on the inside and flexible on the outside. From then on, they conquered these two American clamping hammers, and production efficiency increased more than tenfold compared to before.

    不许死东西难住活人
    我们厂锻工车间使用两台美国造的夹板锤，锤头顶座上的薄木板，每天都得坏一两次到三、四次。木板一坏，钳工就得急忙爬到锤顶上修理，修理一次，需要停工一小时左右。锻工车间每天锻打近百吨的汽车锻件，都得等着这两台夹板锤校正后送到其他车间加工。夹板锤的木板天天坏，每天的锻件不能按时校正完，严重影响生产效率。钳工胡玉民每天都要三番五次的爬到锤顶上修理木板，真是气得直冒火，实在不甘心叫这两个死东西难住活人，就决心要改造它。
    开始他们试用铁板代替锤顶座上的木板没有成功。他们又改用了石棉铜板，经过试验，柔软的程度和木板相同。于是他们就提出用石棉铜板代替木板的建议。最后在秦机械师的协助下，用低碳软钢作板心，用石棉铜板作外层，用紫铜铆合牢固，终于制成了内质坚固外表柔韧的夹板，从此治服了这两台美国夹板锤，生产效率比以前提高十几倍。
