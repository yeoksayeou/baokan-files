    Sesame is Not a Low-Yield Crop
    Strengthening Field Management Can Increase Production
    (Our dispatch) This reporter Wang Tiqiang reports: The National Sesame Production Promotion Conference held in Jiuquan County, Gansu, from June 21st to 30th, overturned the "low-yield sesame theory," giving sesame its due status. At the same time, various regions also formulated five-year leap forward plans for sesame in the future.
    In order to implement the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao that "oil production should be raised to the same important position as grain and cotton," the conference first analyzed the national grain, cotton, and oil production situation. It pointed out that since liberation, oil crop production has increased thanks to the efforts of the broad masses of farmers and the correct leadership of party and government at all levels, basically guaranteeing the needs of the country and the people; however, compared with the growth rate of grain and cotton, oil is still lagging behind. Although sesame has not been given targets in the National Agricultural Development Program, it is the main edible oil crop in seven provinces (regions), including Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Hebei. Except for Hebei Province, the average sesame oil accounts for 70%-80% of edible oils in the remaining six provinces and regions. Therefore, the conference requested that these regions should attach importance to sesame production.
    Although the planting area of sesame in the country reaches more than 10 million mu, most of it is planted on idle land, bad land, and wasteland, and after planting, it is not watered, fertilized, or weeded, and the average yield per mu is only more than 40 jin. This is the reason why sesame production is generally low in most areas. However, the sesame production situation in Jiuquan County is different. In 1957, the average yield per mu of more than 26,000 mu of sesame was 140 jin, and the yield per mu in high-yield fields was more than 500 jin. Judging from this year's growth, the average yield per mu can reach more than 300 jin, and there will be more high-yield fields. After the representatives visited sesame production in Jiuquan, they found that sesame is not a "low-yield" crop, but people's thinking is "low-yield," and increased production measures have not kept up. Those who originally thought that sesame was "unlucky crop," not only sesame production was low, but also the wheat planted after sesame would have low yields, saw the fact that sesame and wheat have bumper harvests in Jiuquan, and concluded that sesame and wheat can promote each other, and achieve high yields at the same time.
    This was a very good promotion conference. After learning about the central policy, the importance of planting sesame, and the fact that sesame is not a low-yield oil crop, representatives from various regions put forward their respective regional leap forward plans for sesame production, and sent telegrams and phone calls back home asking their families to immediately attach more importance to sesame production, strengthen field management, and strive for a bumper harvest of sesame this year.
    More than 90 representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Textile Industry, and provinces and regions such as Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Hebei attended this promotion conference.

### 胡麻并非低产作物  加强田间管理就能提高产量

    胡麻并非低产作物
    加强田间管理就能提高产量
    本报讯　记者王体强报道：6月21日至30日在甘肃酒泉县召开的全国胡麻生产促进会，打破了“胡麻低产论”，给胡麻以应得地位，同时各地还订出了胡麻今后五年跃进规划。
    为了贯彻中央和毛主席提出的“要把油料生产提到和粮食、棉花同等重要的地位”这一指示精神，会议首先分析了全国粮、棉、油生产情况。指出解放以来油料作物生产经过广大农民的努力和各级党政的正确领导，产量是增长的，基本上保证了国家和人民的需要；但是，如果和粮食、棉花增长速度比较，油料还落在后面。胡麻在全国农业发展纲要中虽未提出指标，但它是甘肃、新疆、青海、宁夏、内蒙古、山西、河北等七个省（区）的主要食用油料作物，除河北省外，其余六个省区平均胡麻油要占到食用油脂的70％—80％。因此，会议要求这些地区应该重视胡麻生产。
    胡麻在全国的种植面积虽达一千多万亩，但多数是被种在隙地、坏地、撩荒地上，种上以后不浇水、不施肥、也不锄草，平均亩产只有四十多斤。这就是一般地区胡麻低产的原因。但是，酒泉县的胡麻生产情况却不相同，1957年两万六千多亩胡麻平均亩产一百四十斤，丰产田亩产五百多斤。从今年生长情况看，平均亩产可达三百斤以上，高额丰产田将会更多。代表们参观了酒泉的胡麻生产以后，发现胡麻并非“低产”作物，而是人们的思想“低产”，增产措施没跟上去。原认为胡麻是“倒霉庄稼”，不但胡麻低产，而且槎后种的小麦也会低产的人，在酒泉看到了胡麻、小麦双丰收的事实，得出结论说：胡麻、小麦可以互相促进，同时高产。
    这是一次很好的促进会，各地代表在了解了中央方针和种胡麻的重要意义以及胡麻并非低产油料作物以后，他们都提出了本地区胡麻生产的跃进规划，打电报、电话回去要家里立即把胡麻生产更加重视起来，加强田间管理，力争今年胡麻大丰收。
    农业部、粮食部、轻工业部、纺织工业部以及甘肃、青海、新疆、宁夏、内蒙古、山西、河北等省区的代表九十多人出席了这次促进会。
