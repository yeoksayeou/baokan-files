    A Strong Force Defending Peace in Europe
    From June 27th to 29th, the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of fifteen European countries, at the invitation of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, held a meeting in Berlin to discuss the major issue of jointly opposing the imperialist war policy and striving for peace in Europe. On July 4th, the meeting issued a joint statement, emphasizing the dangerous situation currently created in Europe due to West Germany's atomic armament, and exposing the conspiracy of American and West German imperialism to prepare for atomic war in Europe. The statement called on the working class and the broad masses of people in European countries to further develop activities and more effectively engage in the struggle to safeguard peace.
    The declaration of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries in Moscow last November solemnly declared to the world: "The communist parties of all countries consider the struggle for peace to be their primary task." The peace declaration of the communist and workers' parties of all countries demanded "to give the world peace." Since then, socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, and the communist parties of all countries have further strengthened their efforts to safeguard world peace. Now, the joint statement of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of fifteen European countries expresses the will of the broad masses of European people to demand peace and oppose war, and once again demonstrates the determination of the European working class to defend world peace. The resounding call it issued will further inspire the struggle of the European people to strive for peace.
    For a long time, one of the roots of the tense situation in Europe has been the rearmament of West Germany. In order to establish a new source of war in the center of Europe, American imperialism has stubbornly implemented a policy of supporting and reviving West German militarist forces and rearming them, in order to use West Germany's revanchist forces as a commando for launching a new war. The result of this policy has been to divide Germany and make West Germany a pillar of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Under the instructions of the United States, the West German government recently forced the West German Federal Parliament to formally adopt a resolution to arm West German troops with atomic weapons; at the same time, the Western European Union also passed a resolution allowing West Germany to manufacture missiles. This has seriously threatened peace and security throughout Europe.
    In order to eliminate the tense situation in Europe caused by the American and West German governments, the Soviet government and the governments of other socialist countries have made great efforts. The Soviet government has withdrawn its troops from East Germany several times in the past; at the end of last year, the Polish government proposed the initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe; and not long ago, the Warsaw Treaty member states passed a resolution on reducing armed forces. All these series of actions and proposals of socialist countries are obviously positive steps to eliminate military confrontation in Europe and the danger of nuclear war, and are therefore welcomed and supported by the broad masses of European people. However, all this has been rejected by the American and West German governments. They responded to the peace proposals of the Soviet government and the Polish government by stepping up preparations for war and creating the fait accompli of West German atomic armament, in order to continue to aggravate the tense situation in Europe.
    This practice of the American and West German governments has aroused the firm opposition of the people of European countries. The United States' unreasonable rejection of the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe cannot erase the huge influence of this plan in the hearts of the broad masses of people. Now, not only the people of European countries but also many bourgeois politicians, and even some governments of the North Atlantic Group countries, disagree with the stubborn attitude of the United States and demand that the Polish government's proposal be reconsidered. In West Germany, the Adenauer government's manipulation of parliament to pass the atomic armament resolution has not stopped the West German people's struggle against the atomic armament policy; on the contrary, the struggle has become more intense. More than 80% of the West German people oppose atomic armament, and more and more people from all walks of life have joined the vigorously developing "movement against the atomic death policy." This struggle even caused Adenauer's party to suffer a defeat in the recent election of the mayor of Heidelberg in West Germany. This development has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary forces in the United States and West Germany.
    The call issued by the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of fifteen European countries to stop West Germany's atomic armament and strive for peace in Europe is entirely in line with the wishes of the people of European countries and their vital interests. At the same time, it is also a powerful warning to the American imperialist and West German militarist forces' atomic war preparation conspiracy. Now, the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, and imperialism is being defeated and isolated all over the world. In Germany, the first worker-peasant country in history, the German Democratic Republic, is growing and becoming stronger day by day, and has become a strong fortress for maintaining peace and security in Europe. As long as the peace-loving people of Europe and the world unite and fight together, the imperialist conspiracy to launch a war can be stopped. As the joint statement of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of fifteen European countries pointed out: "Mankind wants peace, and it possesses all the means and forces to defend peace. Peace will surely triumph over war."

### 保卫欧洲和平的坚强力量

    保卫欧洲和平的坚强力量
    6月27日到29日，欧洲十五国共产党和工人党的代表应德国共产党中央委员会的邀请在柏林举行了会议，讨论了共同反对帝国主义战争政策、争取欧洲和平的重大问题。7月4日会议发表了联合声明，强调指出了目前由于西德进行原子武装而在欧洲造成的危险局势，揭露了美国和西德帝国主义在欧洲准备原子战争的阴谋。声明号召欧洲各国工人阶级和广大人民群众进一步开展活动，更有效地从事维护和平的斗争。
    去年11月在莫斯科发表的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言曾经向全世界庄严地宣告：“各国共产党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务”。各国共产党和工人党的和平宣言要求“给世界以和平”。那时以来，以苏联为首的社会主义国家和各国共产党进一步加强了维护世界和平的努力。而现在欧洲十五国共产党和工人党代表会议的联合声明表达了广大欧洲人民要求和平、反对战争的意志，又一次显示了欧洲工人阶级保卫世界和平的决心。它所发出的响亮的召唤将更加鼓舞起欧洲人民争取和平的斗争。
    长期以来，造成欧洲紧张局势的根源之一就是西德的重新武装。美国帝国主义为了在欧洲中心建立一个新的战争策源地，一意孤行地执行扶植和复活西德军国主义势力，并把他们重新武装起来的政策，以便利用西德的复仇主义力量作为发动新战争的突击队。这种政策的结果使德国陷于分裂，使西德成为北大西洋侵略集团的支柱。根据美国的指令，西德政府不久前强使西德联邦议院正式通过用原子武器武装西德部队的决议；同时西欧联盟也通过了允许西德制造导弹的决议。这样就使全欧洲的和平和安全遭受到严重的威胁。
    为了消除美国和西德政府所造成的欧洲紧张局势，苏联政府和其他社会主义国家政府曾经尽了很大的努力。苏联政府过去已经几次从民主德国撤退了自己的军队；去年年底波兰政府提出了建立中欧无原子武器区的创议；而不久前华沙条约缔约国又通过了关于裁减武装部队的决议。社会主义各国的所有这一系列的行动和建议显然是消除欧洲军事对立和爆发原子战争危险的积极性步骤，因而得到欧洲广大人民的欢迎和支持。但是这一切都遭到了美国和西德政府的拒绝。他们用加紧备战，造成西德原子武装的既成事实来回答苏联政府和波兰政府的和平建议，以继续加剧欧洲的紧张局势。
    美国和西德政府的这种做法引起欧洲各国人民的坚决反对。美国无理拒绝建立中欧无原子武器区的建议，并不能勾消这个计划在广大人民心中的巨大影响。现在不仅欧洲各国人民而且许多资产阶级的政治人物、甚至某些北大西洋集团国家政府也不同意美国的顽固态度，要求重新考虑波兰政府的建议。在西德，阿登纳政府操纵议会通过原子武装的决议也没有使西德人民反对原子武装政策的斗争停止下来，相反的，斗争是更加激烈了。80％以上的西德人民反对原子武装，越来越多的各阶层人士投入了蓬勃展开的“反对原子死亡政策的运动”。这一斗争甚至使最近阿登纳党在西德海得尔堡市长选举中遭到了失败。这种形势的发展给美国和西德的反动势力一个沉重的打击。
    欧洲十五国共产党和工人党代表会议发出的制止西德原子武装和争取欧洲和平的号召是完全符合欧洲各国人民的愿望和他们的切身利益的。同时，它也是对美国帝国主义和西德军国主义势力的原子备战阴谋的一个有力的警告。现在和平的力量超过了战争的势力，帝国主义正在全世界遭到失败和孤立。在德国，历史上第一个工农国家德意志民主共和国正在日益成长和壮大，已经成为一个维护欧洲和平和安全的坚强堡垒。只要欧洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民团结起来，共同进行斗争，帝国主义发动战争的阴谋是可以被制止的。正像欧洲十五国共产党和工人党代表会议的联合声明中所指出的：“人类要和平，它拥有一切捍卫和平的手段和力量。和平一定会战胜战争”。
