Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 29th: Cai Youlu, the father of the famous combat hero Cai Jintong of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, began his propaganda journey on the 27th to collect signatures against the armed aggression in the Middle East by American and British imperialism. The first goal of his planned journey is to travel throughout all the villages and market towns of his hometown, Mei County, exposing the aggressive crimes of American and British imperialism and collecting 100,000 anti-aggression signatures. He is determined to continue his propaganda journey until the American and British aggressors are driven out of Lebanon and Jordan.

In the winter of 1951, Cai Jintong ambushed at Aguli, west of Tieyuan in Korea. After being wounded in the abdomen, he continued to fight, personally bayoneting fourteen American devils. He was awarded the title of First Class Merit Citation, Second Class Combat Hero, and Steel Warrior by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Cai Youlu felt infinite glory for his son's outstanding record of killing and wounding American devils. In 1953, he accompanied the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to visit Cai Jintong and his comrades. After seeing and learning about the bloody atrocities of American imperialism in Korea, Cai Youlu hated American imperialism even more.

After the news of American and British imperialism's armed aggression in the Middle East came, he was extremely angry and said that he would never allow the crimes of American imperialism in Korea to be repeated in Arab countries. He immediately joined the demobilized soldiers, military family members, and members of the joint agricultural cooperative in the village to hold many rallies against the armed aggression of American and British imperialism in the Middle East. He also initiated an anti-aggression signature campaign, and everyone in the village signed their names.

On the night before setting off on this propaganda journey, Cai Youlu invited the villagers and neighbors to jointly write a letter to Cai Jintong, who is in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, asking Cai Jintong and his comrades to pay close attention to the actions of the imperialist wolves, hold their weapons tightly, and be ready at any time to severely strike the aggressors.

    英雄的父亲要干出英雄事业
    蔡有禄决心走遍全县征集十万人签名
    到处揭露美英侵略罪行直到把侵略者赶出西亚为止
    新华社西安29日电　中国人民志愿军著名战斗英雄蔡金同的父亲蔡有禄，从27日起开始了他的为反对美英帝国主义武装侵略中东征集签名的宣传旅行。他计划中旅行的第一个目标，是走遍他的家乡郿县所有乡村和集镇，揭露美英帝国主义的侵略罪行，并征集十万个反侵略签名。他决心把他的这一宣传旅行活动一直进行到把美英侵略者赶出黎巴嫩和约旦为止。
    蔡金同1951年冬在朝鲜铁原以西的阿谷里伏击战中，在腹部负伤后，继续战斗，他一个人就刺杀了十四个美国鬼子，荣获中国人民志愿军一等功臣、二级战斗英雄和钢铁战士的称号，蔡有禄为他的儿子杀伤美国鬼子的卓越战绩而感到无限光荣。1953年，他曾随中国人民赴朝慰问团去朝鲜，探望过蔡金同和他的战友们。蔡有禄在朝鲜看到和了解到美帝国主义的血腥暴行后，对美帝国主义就更加仇恨。
    美英帝国主义在中东进行武装侵略的消息传来后，他愤怒异常，表示决不容许美帝国主义者在朝鲜的罪行再搬到阿拉伯国家去重演。他立即和全村的复员军人、军属联合农业社的社员举行了多次反对美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的集会。并且发起了反侵略签名运动，全村的人都签了名。
    在这次宣传旅行出发的前一天晚上，蔡有禄邀集全村乡亲邻居联合给正在中国人民志愿军某部的蔡金同写信，要蔡金同和他的战友们好好注意帝国主义豺狼的一举一动，握紧武器，时刻准备着狠狠打击侵略者。
