Oppose the United States and South Vietnam's Illegal Import of Weapons
Commentator of This Newspaper

    On June 14th, Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference regarding the continuous violations of the Geneva Accords by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities in importing new weapons into the South Vietnam region, and the recent resolution passed by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam allowing the South Vietnamese authorities to "replace" the weapons taken away by the French forces upon their withdrawal. He pointed out that these actions by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities fundamentally violate the Geneva Accords, and that the resolution of the International Commission is also inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords, and is therefore detrimental to peace in Indochina and the reunification of Vietnam. We believe that the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is entirely correct and worthy of serious consideration by relevant countries.

    As is well known, after the 1954 Geneva Conference, U.S. imperialism colluded with the Manila Pact aggressive bloc to threaten peace in Indochina and shipped large quantities of weapons and ammunition into the South Vietnam region. Now, it and the South Vietnamese authorities are attempting to unscrupulously import weapons under the pretext of "replacing" the weapons taken away by the French forces upon their withdrawal, which is unacceptable to anyone who respects and upholds the Geneva Accords.

    The purpose of the Geneva Accords on Indochina is to restore and consolidate peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the three Indochinese states. To this end, the Geneva Conference took note of the French government's statement that it would withdraw its troops from the territories of the three countries. It is clear from this that the withdrawal of French troops from Vietnam is necessary to respect Vietnam's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, and should be a withdrawal in the strictest sense, not a "rotation." Since the French forces are withdrawing, there is no question of "replacing" the weapons that are withdrawn with them. Now, some people are trying to describe the withdrawal of French forces and their weapons as "rotation" and "replacement," which is tantamount to opening the door to U.S. armed intervention in South Vietnam. This is a crude distortion and violation of the Geneva Accords.

    In order to prevent any misinterpretation of the issue of weapons replacement, the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam stipulated in the clearest possible terms that only weapons, ammunition, and other war materials that were "destroyed or worn out" after the ceasefire could be "replaced." Of course, it is hard to imagine that the weapons, ammunition, and other war materials taken away by the French forces upon their withdrawal were all "destroyed or worn out." From this point alone, the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities have no reason to "replace" the weapons and other war materials taken away by the French forces.

    The attempt to use the "military balance theory" to justify the United States' illegal import of weapons is nothing more than a revamped version of the "position of strength" theory. However, this "position of strength" theory cannot find any basis in the Geneva Accords, and can only explain the essence of aggressive organizations such as the "North Atlantic Treaty," the "Baghdad Pact," and the "Southeast Asia Treaty." Therefore, the fallacy of describing U.S. military intervention as being for the sake of "maintaining military balance" must be denounced.

    The Chinese people firmly oppose the illegal import of new weapons into the South Vietnam region by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities. The United States and the South Vietnamese authorities must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from this incident.

    反对美国和南越非法运入武器
    本报评论员
    越南民主共和国范文同总理曾于6月14日就美国和南越当局不断违反日内瓦协议，以新的武器运入南越地区问题和越南国际委员会于最近通过一项决议允许南越当局“替换”法军撤出时携走的武器问题，致函日内瓦会议两位主席，指出美国和南越当局这些行为根本违反日内瓦协议，而越南国际委员会的决议也与日内瓦协议的精神和文字不相符合，因而是不利于印度支那的和平和越南的统一的。我们认为越南民主共和国政府的这种立场是完全正确的，是值得有关国家慎重考虑的。
    如所周知，1954年日内瓦会议以后，美帝国主义即纠合马尼拉侵略集团对印度支那的和平进行威胁，并向南越地区运入了大量的武器弹药。现在它和南越当局又企图以“替换”法军撤退时携走的武器为名，肆无忌惮地运入武器，这是任何尊重和维护日内瓦协议的人所不能允许的。
    日内瓦会议关于印度支那的协议的目的在于在尊重印度支那三国的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上来恢复和巩固印度支那的和平。为此，日内瓦会议曾经注意到法国政府的声明，即它将从三国领土上撤退其军队。由此可见，法军之撤出越南乃为尊重越南独立、主权、统一和领土完整所必需，应该是最严格意义上的撤退，而不是“轮换”。既然法军是撤退，对于随同它一起撤退的武器就根本不发生“替换”问题。现在有人硬要把法军和它的武器的撤走说成是“轮换”和“替换”，这无异给美国武装干涉南越大开方便之门。这是对日内瓦协议粗暴的曲解和违反。
    为了防止对于武器替换问题的任何曲解，关于在越南停止敌对行动的日内瓦协议曾以最明白无误的文字规定，只有在停战后“毁坏损耗”的武器、弹药和其他作战物资才能进行“替换”。当然，很难设想法军撤退时所携走的武器、弹药和其他作战物资都是“毁坏损耗”的。单单从这一条来看，美国和南越当局也没有任何理由来“替换”法军撤退时所携走的武器等作战物资。
    企图用“保持军事平衡说”来为美国非法运入武器进行开脱，这不过是“实力地位”论的翻版而已。但是，这种“实力地位”论不可能从日内瓦协议中找到任何根据，而只能为“北大西洋公约”、“巴格达条约”和“东南亚条约”这些侵略性组织的实质作解释。因此，必须斥责把美国的军事干涉说成是为了“保持军事平衡说”的这种谬论。
    中国人民坚决反对美国和南越当局非法地向南越地区运入新的武器。美国和南越当局应对这一事件所产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
