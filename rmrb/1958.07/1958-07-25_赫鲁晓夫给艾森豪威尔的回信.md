Khrushchev's Reply to Eisenhower
President,
I have received your reply to my letter of July 19. I have also received replies to my letter of July 19 from Mr. Nehru, Mr. Macmillan, and Mr. de Gaulle.

Now, I do not want to argue about the causes that have caused tension and threatened peace in the Middle East. I have already discussed the Soviet government's views on all these issues in my letter of July 19. However, I want to firmly deny the assertion you made in your letter that the Soviet Union is supporting expansionist and aggressive forces in the world. Since the United States carried out armed intervention in Lebanon and Britain in Jordan, if anyone in the past was unclear about who is truly pursuing a policy of expansion and aggression that threatens peace and the security of all peoples, there should be no doubt now.

The Soviet government believes that the threat to universal peace is now extremely serious. We must not waste words and delay the date of reaching an agreement. All possible and most urgent measures must be taken to prevent a world conflict. We must not diminish the danger of such a conflict, because there are now those who advocate expanding the zone of aggression and are primarily planning a military offensive against Iraq.

Precisely because we want to prevent a world conflict, we propose that a summit meeting of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India be held immediately, with the participation of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. We are gratified to learn that the Soviet government's proposal for a summit meeting has received a positive response from your side. British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Prime Minister de Gaulle, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru have also expressed their willingness to hold such a meeting, and we would like to express our gratitude for this.

We can accept British Prime Minister Macmillan's suggestion to hold a summit meeting within the framework of the Security Council. The Soviet government pointed out in its letter of July 19 that the Security Council should not be avoided.

In view of the urgent measures that must be taken to maintain peace, we believe that the form of the summit meeting is not of decisive significance in this situation. The important thing is to hold this meeting as early as possible in order to find the right solutions as soon as possible to maintain and consolidate peace, stabilize the situation in the Middle East, and ease international tensions.

We also agree with Mr. Macmillan's proposed approach to this special meeting of the Security Council.

We agree that this special meeting of the Security Council should not put forward any draft resolutions that have not been agreed upon in advance. Its purpose is only to reach an agreement, not to determine differences through voting.

The Soviet government's starting point here is that the heads of government will be able to conduct joint consultations that go beyond formal procedures in order to achieve the most rapid and constructive solutions that are conducive to maintaining and consolidating peace.

Since the Security Council is currently discussing issues that are not general daily issues, but issues that are particularly important from the perspective of maintaining peace and ensuring security, we believe that, under the current circumstances, it would be beneficial to include India in the work of the Security Council. Because India is a major Asian country and a country that is recognized as advocating the consolidation of peace. Unlike a so-called permanent member of the Council that does not actually represent anyone, India's participation will be truly beneficial. We believe that it is necessary to have Indian Prime Minister Nehru participate in the work of the Security Council as the representative of India, and he has agreed to participate in the summit meeting.

President, you said in your letter that if a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government is desired by everyone, then the United States will act according to this normal procedure.

As for the Soviet Union, since British Prime Minister Macmillan, French Prime Minister de Gaulle, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and you, President, have agreed to personally participate in the special meeting of the Security Council (as can be seen from your letters), then the Soviet Union will be represented at this meeting by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

It goes without saying that the relevant Arab governments should be included when the Security Council discusses issues with the participation of the aforementioned five heads of government.

The Soviet government wants to know as soon as possible the United States government's opinion on the date of convening a Security Council meeting with the participation of heads of government. We on our side suggest that this work begin on July 28 in the New York Security Council.

With respect,

N. Khrushchev

### 赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的回信

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给艾森豪威尔的回信总统先生：
    我收到了你对我7月19日的信的回信。我也收到了尼赫鲁先生、麦克米伦先生和戴高乐先生对我7月19日去信的回信。
    现在，我不想去争论那些引起紧张局势和给中近东地区和平造成威胁的原因。我在7月19日的信里已经谈过了苏联政府对所有这些问题的看法。不过我要坚决否认你在信里提到的那种认为苏联在支持世界上的扩张势力和侵略势力的说法。自从美国对黎巴嫩和英国对约旦实行武装干涉后，如果有谁过去弄不清楚究竟是谁真正在执行威胁和平和各国人民安全的扩张和侵略政策的话，那么现在不会再有怀疑了。
    苏联政府认为，现在普遍和平受到的威胁极其严重，不能再徒费唇舌，以致延迟达成协议的日期，必须采取一切可能的和最紧急的措施来防止发生世界冲突。我们不能缩小这种冲突的危险性，因为现在有人主张扩大侵略区，而且首先在策划对伊拉克实行军事进攻。
    正因为要防止发生世界冲突，所以我们才建议立即召开有联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生参加的苏、美、英、法、印度政府的首脑会议。我们满意地获悉，苏联政府关于政府首脑会议的建议得到了贵方的积极反应。英国首相麦克米伦先生，法国总理戴高乐先生和印度总理尼赫鲁先生也表示愿意举行这种会议，我们谨对此表示谢意。
    英国首相麦克米伦先生提出在安全理事会的范围内召开政府首脑会议的意见，我们是可以接受的。苏联政府在7月19日的信里已经指出不应当避开安理会。
    鉴于必须采取紧急措施维护和平，我们认为政府首脑会议采取什么形式在这种情况下没有决定性意义。重要的是尽可能早地举行这次会议，以便尽快找到正确的解决办法来维护和巩固和平，安定中近东局面，缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们也同意麦克米伦先生建议那样的办法来对待安理会这次特别会议。
    我们同意，安全理事会这次特别会议不应该提出任何不经事先商妥的决议案，它的目的只是为了达成协议，而不是通过表决来确定分歧。
    这里苏联政府的出发点是：各国政府首脑为了取得有利于维护和巩固和平的最迅速的建设性的解决办法，将有可能进行不只是通过正式程序的共同协商。
    既然当前安理会要讨论的不是一般的日常问题，而是从维护和平和保障安全的角度看来特别重要的问题，因此我们认为，在当前的情况下，吸收印度参加安全理事会的工作是有好处的。因为印度是一个亚洲大国，是一个被公认为主张巩固和平的国家。跟一个实际上并不代表任何人的所谓的常任理事国不同，印度的参加将是真正有益的。我们认为，有必要让印度总理尼赫鲁作为印度代表参加安理会的工作，他已经同意参加政府首脑会议。
    总统先生，您在信中说，假如有政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议是大家都希望举行的话，那末美国将按这一正常的程序行事。
    至于苏联，既然英国首相麦克米伦先生、法国总理戴高乐先生、印度总理尼赫鲁先生和您，总统先生，已经同意亲自参加安理会特别会议（这从你们的信中可以看出），那末苏联将由苏联部长会议主席出席这次会议。
    不言而喻，安理会在上述五国政府首脑参加下讨论问题时应当吸收有关的阿拉伯国家政府参加。
    苏联政府想尽快知道美国政府对召开有政府首脑参加的安理会会议的日期的意见。我们这方面建议7月28日在纽约安理会中开始这项工作。　此致敬意
              尼·赫鲁晓夫
