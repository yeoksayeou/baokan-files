Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch from Santiago: Approximately 10,000 people held a mass rally and demonstration in Santiago, the capital of Chile, on July 20th, protesting the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan.

The Chairman of the Chilean Communist Party, Elias Laferte, and other party leaders participated in the march. Demonstrators waved red flags and Chilean flags, chanting slogans such as "Yankees get out of Lebanon."

Xinhua News Agency, July 20th dispatch: According to TASS, Buenos Aires, July 19th: Progressive Argentine newspapers are condemning the imperialist aggression of the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East and firmly support the struggle of the people of Arab countries for national independence.

"The Times" reported that mass demonstrations were held in Buenos Aires and other cities in Argentina on July 18th to protest US and British interference in the Near and Middle East.

The Liaison Committee of the "Argentine Congress for International Cooperation, Universal Disarmament and National Sovereignty" has requested the Argentine government to instruct its representative to the United Nations to submit a proposal demanding the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Near and Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch: According to TASS, July 20th: The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay issued a statement on British and American intervention in the Middle East, stating that this intervention is a brutal act of aggression against the peoples of the East and a violation of the United Nations Charter. It pushes the world to the brink of a new war with grave consequences.

The statement pointed out: "The peoples of Latin American countries are angrily protesting this new crime by the imperialist countries. Those who launched this aggression are the same imperialist groups that strangled the freedom and independence of Guatemala and are still plundering and exploiting the peoples of the Americas."

The statement concluded by calling on all working people and organizations in Uruguay to condemn the intervention of the United States and Britain and to demand that the Uruguayan representative to the United Nations advocate for the immediate withdrawal of US and British troops from the Middle East.

The Communist Party of Argentina, as well as the Argentine Peace Committee, the Youth Coordinating Committee of the Argentine Congress for International Cooperation, Universal Disarmament and National Sovereignty, the Railway Workers Union, and other organizations, also jointly condemned the intervention of the United States and Britain.

A Committee in Support of the Arab People has also been established in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. This committee calls on the government and domestic public opinion to support the just struggle of the people of Arab countries for freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st dispatch: Buenos Aires news: According to a recent report in the Argentine "Times", the Argentine Arab League Association issued a communiqué expressing full support for the armed uprising of the Lebanese people and opposing the long-planned armed intervention by the United States and Britain. The Argentine Arab League Association is an organization of Lebanese people residing in Argentina.

The communiqué said that the Lebanese events were entirely and solely due to the pro-imperialist policy of the Chamoun government and its support for the discredited "Eisenhower Doctrine," which aimed to use the Lebanese people as cannon fodder for imperialism. The communiqué went on to state that "the only and real interveners and aggressors" are the two imperialist countries, the United States and Britain.

The communiqué said that the Argentine Arab League Association fully supports the heroic struggle of the Lebanese patriots for national liberation and national independence, strongly opposes the armed intervention of Britain and the United States, and condemns the Chamoun puppet government's massacre of the heroic Lebanese people.
