Welcome the Return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Chen Yi

(I)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    Welcome back to the motherland.
    You have made friends,
    You have defeated the enemy.
    You have defended the motherland,
    You have saved peace.
    Your achievements will last forever!

(II)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    Welcome back to the motherland.
    You have made Korean friends,
    And established a deep friendship in battle.
    Koreans are relatives of the Chinese,
    Chinese are relatives of the Koreans.
    Sino-Korean friendship will last forever!

(III)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    Welcome back to the motherland.
    You defeated the enemy in Korea.
    They boasted that they had not been defeated for over a hundred years,
    But this time they were defeated by the Koreans and the Chinese.
    Modernized warfare
    Proved that the Chinese and Korean armies are capable.
    Sino-Korean unity will last forever!

(IV)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    Welcome back to the motherland.
    You have defended the motherland,
    And the motherland's construction has also supported you.
    Fighting while building,
    This most valuable experience,
    Convinced all the doubters,
    And also severely taught the enemy a lesson.
    Comrades, remember:
    Aggressors suffer a disastrous defeat.
    Sacred self-defense is truly glorious!

(V)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    Welcome back to the motherland.
    You have stopped aggression,
    You have saved peace.
    Do not forget your friends,
    And always be vigilant against the enemy!
    Comrades, be prepared for everything,
    Be vigilant in times of peace,
    Because enemies still occupy our territory!

(VI)
    Comrades of the Volunteer Army,
    You are returning to the country in batches,
    We warmly welcome you.
    The motherland's construction is in the midst of a great leap forward,
    It welcomes you with open arms.
    We must overcome nature,
    Look, what a powerful enemy this is!
    Quickly join this new battle:
    Direct our revolution to the Earth's surface!
    Direct our revolution to the outer layers of the sky!
                        June 1958
