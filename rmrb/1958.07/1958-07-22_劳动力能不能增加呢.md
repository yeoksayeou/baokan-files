Can Labor Power Be Increased?

"China has too much labor!" This used to be a topic of heated discussion by some people. In the face of the Great Leap Forward, this one-sided view has collapsed. Many places have experienced labor shortages. Taking Shanxi Province as an example, this province currently needs to add 95,000 apprentices and 150,000 temporary workers in the industrial sector alone; after taking various measures, 25% of the apprentices and 43% of the temporary workers have not been found. Other places have similar situations. As for the rural areas, they are also feeling the lack of labor. Due to intensive cultivation, the labor required in the fields this year has generally doubled. Next year, due to the expansion of the scale of water conservancy projects, it is estimated that more labor will be needed. All these situations indicate that labor shortage has become an urgent problem to be solved in the current Great Leap Forward in production.

The problem of labor shortage is quite tense. However, this tension is a good thing, not a bad thing. Because this is the tension brought about by the Great Leap Forward in production, not the tension brought about by the retreat of production. Our goal is to make full use of China's advantageous condition of having a large population and abundant labor force, and to push the development speed of production to the highest possible level. We are fundamentally different from those who believe that China's population is "too" large and the labor force is "too" abundant, and therefore a "bad thing." We are promoters; we dare to face this tension, and we also have the ability to resolve this contradiction and eliminate this tension.

Recently, various places have explored some methods to solve the problem of labor shortage, such as the methods adopted in the industrial sector and in the cities to improve labor organization: reorganizing specialized work teams with too detailed division of labor into comprehensive work teams; appropriately adjusting the working hours of seasonal production workers; consolidating labor discipline and improving attendance rates; implementing inter-enterprise supplementation of surpluses; streamlining personnel from commercial departments and state organs to support industry; improving the preparatory worker system; absorbing unemployed urban residents to engage in production; implementing part-work, part-study in secondary schools; and so on. These methods are all relatively effective. However, an even more effective method is to mobilize the masses to organize large-scale collective economic undertakings, so that the families of employees and street residents can be liberated from scattered and trivial housework and participate in socialist construction. Among the families of employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, there are more than 5,000 women with labor ability between the ages of sixteen and forty-five, and more than half of them are now participating in production. In Tianjin, 15,000 families of employees have participated in production in the past month. Hongshunli, which is praised as a socialist big family, has a total of 42 households. Within a few days, they established a copper wire processing group, a food supply station, a library, a nursery group, and a public canteen. In this way, what used to require every family to cook and take care of children now only requires three people to take care of children for everyone and three people to cook for everyone, freeing up seventeen young women to devote themselves to production. After many factories and handicraft cooperatives handed over some simple tasks to the families of employees and residents, they freed up manpower to invest in the production of important processes. In this way, they did not increase factory buildings, equipment, and formal workers, but their production efficiency was greatly improved.

Some people, as soon as they see the tension in labor in industrial production, advocate asking for people from the countryside. Yes, the vast countryside is a source of labor, but when the rural labor force also appears to be in the same state of tension, can any new ways be adopted to supplement the labor force? The experiences of Shanxi, Beijing, Tianjin and other places show that improving social labor organization and labor management can tap great potential.

Facts tell us that when calculating the contradiction between labor resources and needs, we should not only calculate based on the existing labor force of each enterprise and department, but should calculate based on the entire society of each city and rural area. At present, whether in cities or in the countryside, if we earnestly and systematically organize women's housework and other undertakings that serve life into a collective economic undertaking of considerable scale, then we can liberate a very large group of labor force from society and invest it in productive labor. Changing housework from one household to collective labor, and running public canteens and nurseries in urban streets and rural areas, is an important measure to further change the relations of production according to the needs of socialist construction, and it will be more suitable for promoting the development of productive forces.

Labor organization is an important part of the relations of production. The Great Leap Forward in production requires corresponding improvement in labor organization. That is to say, the great development of productive forces requires a corresponding improvement in the relations of production. The faster the productive forces develop, the faster the relations of production need to be improved. Some people advocate taking it slowly on the issue of further improving the relations of production. They feel that after the problem of ownership has been basically solved, the problem of the relations of production is not a big one, so why raise the specific problems in practical work such as improving labor organization so high and see them so seriously? And why see the further improvement of the relations of production as so urgent? These people's thinking is far behind reality on the issue of further improving the relations of production. They do not realize that if labor organization is not improved in a timely and corresponding manner, the development of productive forces will be affected. It can be affirmed that these people are bound to run into snags in the face of reality.

To solve the difficulty of labor shortage, there is also a more important way, which is to vigorously carry out mass technological revolution movements, continuously improve labor tools, and improve the technical and cultural level of workers. Recently, various places have also provided many good experiences in solving the problem of labor shortage through accelerating technological revolution. In the industrial sector, the movement of "one person with multiple skills, one machine with multiple uses" is universally promoted, and the movement of improving tools and equipment is carried out. In the agricultural sector, the manufacturing and promotion of agricultural machinery are vigorously organized; and the masses are mobilized to realize semi-mechanization of construction and improvement of tools on water conservancy construction sites and in transportation. These practices have improved labor productivity, saved a large amount of labor, and played a great role in solving the problem of labor shortage.

Whether to carry out technological revolution is no longer a question now. The question now is: Should we carry out technological revolution at the fastest possible speed? Or "take it slowly"? In fact, some people are advocating "taking it slowly" now. They regard the instruction of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party to "appropriately combine mechanical operation, semi-mechanical operation and necessary manual labor" as a static combination of these three forms, rather than understanding that each form must be actively developed to a higher level as quickly as possible. The mistake of this kind of person is also due to thinking lagging behind reality, failing to see the pressing situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, and failing to see that the technological revolution must be carried out at the fastest possible speed, otherwise the high-speed development of productive forces cannot be guaranteed. These people should go deep into reality, listen to the opinions of the masses, so as to change their understanding, act as promoters in the technological revolution, and actively make manual labor develop into semi-mechanization as quickly as possible, and semi-mechanized labor develop into mechanization as quickly as possible.

The problem of labor shortage is a specific problem that has emerged in the current leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Can labor power be increased? Our answer to this question is completely affirmative. This is to further improve the relations of production and accelerate the technological revolution. These two major issues belong to policy issues. Actively solving these two major policy issues will further accelerate the development speed of the entire economy. We promote the leap forward in production, and the leap forward in production forces us to solve all kinds of new problems in a timely manner, so that production has a greater leap forward. This is the road of our promoters and continuous revolutionaries, which is to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 劳动力能不能增加呢

   劳动力能不能增加呢
    “中国的劳动力过多了！”这曾经是过去有些人热烈议论的题目，在大跃进的形势面前，这种片面的观点不攻自破了。许多地方出现了劳动力不足的情况。以山西省为例，目前这个省仅在工业方面就需要增加九万五千个徒工和十五万个临时工；在采取了种种措施之后，还有25％的徒工和43％的临时工没有着落。其它地方也有类似的情况。而农村的情况呢，同样是感到劳动力不足。由于精耕细作，今年田间需要的劳动力普遍增加一倍。明年由于水利工程规模的扩大，估计需要的劳动力会更多，这种种情况说明，劳动力不足已成为当前生产大跃进中迫切需要解决的一个问题。
    劳动力不足，这个问题相当紧张。但是，这种紧张是好事而不是坏事。因为，这是生产大跃进带来的紧张，而不是生产后退带来的紧张。我们的目的就是要充分利用中国人口多、劳动力多的这个有利条件，把生产的发展速度推进到尽可能的最高程度。我们同那些认为中国人口“太”多、劳动力“过”多因而是“坏事”的促退派，是决不相同的。我们是促进派，我们敢于面对这种紧张，我们也就有能力解决这个矛盾，消除这种紧张。
    近来，各地为解决劳动力不足的问题，摸索了一些办法，如在工业部门中和在城市中所采取的改善劳动组织的办法有：把分工太细的专业工作队改组成综合性的工作队；适当地调整季节性生产工人的工作时间；巩固劳动纪律，提高出勤率；在企业之间实行以余补缺；从商业部门和国家机关中精简人员，支援工业；改进预备工制度；吸收城市无业人员从事生产；中等学校实行半工半读；等等。这些办法都是比较有效的。然而更加有效的一个办法，却是发动群众组织大规模的集体经济事业，使职工家属、街道居民从分散繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，参加社会主义建设。北京石景山钢铁厂职工家属中十六岁到四十五岁有劳动能力的妇女共有五千多人，现在有半数以上参加生产。天津在最近一个月中有一万五千个职工家属参加生产。被人誉为社会主义大家庭的鸿顺里，共有四十二户居民，几天之内建立起加工铜丝小组、食品供应站、图书馆、托儿组、公共食堂。这样，原来需要家家煮饭管孩子的，现在只要三个人为大家看孩子，三个人为大家煮饭，腾出了十七名青年妇女投入生产。许多工厂、手工业社把一部分简单活交给职工家属和居民们以后，就腾出了人力投入重要工序的生产。这样，他们没有增加厂房、设备和正式工人，而生产效率却大大提高了。
    有些人一看到工业生产上劳动力紧张就主张向农村要人。是的，广大农村是劳动力的泉源，但是，当农村劳动力也出现同样紧张的时候，能否采取什么新的途径来补充劳动大军呢？山西、北京、天津等地的经验说明，改善社会劳动组织和劳动管理就可挖出很大的潜力。
    事实告诉我们：在计算劳动力资源和需要之间的矛盾的时候，不能只从各个企业、各个部门现有劳动力为单位来计算，而应当以各个城市和农村的整个社会为单位来计算。目前，不论在城市和农村，如果我们认真地系统地把妇女的家务劳动以及其他为生活服务的事业，组织成为相当规模的集体经济事业，那末，我们就可以从社会上解放极大的一批劳动力投入生产劳动。把家务劳动由一家一户改为集体劳动，在城市街道、农村举办公共食堂和托儿所，这是根据社会主义建设需要，进一步改变生产关系的重要措施，它将更加适合与推动生产力的发展。
    劳动组织是生产关系的一个重要内容。生产大跃进要求相应地改善劳动组织。也就是说，生产力的大发展要求相应地改善生产关系。生产力发展得越快，就要求生产关系改善得越快。有一些人在进一步改善生产关系的问题上主张慢慢来。他们觉得，所有制的问题基本解决之后，生产关系的问题已经不大，何必把改善劳动组织这种实际工作中的具体问题提得那么高，看得那么严重呢？又何必把进一步改善生产关系这件事看得那么紧迫呢？这些人在进一步改善生产关系的问题上，思想大大落在了实际的后面。他们没有认识到，如果不及时相应地改善劳动组织，生产力的发展就会受到影响。可以肯定，在现实面前，这些人是一定要碰钉子的。
    解决劳动力不足的困难，还有一条更重要的途径，这就是大张旗鼓开展群众性的技术革命运动，不断改良劳动工具，提高劳动者的技术文化水平。近来，各地在通过加速技术革命的途径来解决劳动力不足的问题上，也提供了不少很好的经验。在工业方面普遍推广“一人多艺，一机多用”的运动，开展改良工具和设备的运动。在农业方面大力组织农业机械的制造和推广工作；在水利工地上和运输方面发动群众实现施工的半机械化和工具的改良。这些做法，提高了劳动生产率，节约了大量的劳动力，对解决劳动力不足的问题，起了很大的作用。
    要不要进行技术革命，现在已经不成其为问题了。现在的问题是：用尽可能快的速度进行技术革命呢？还是“慢慢来”？现在实际上是有人主张“慢慢来”的。他们把党的八大二次会议提出的“使机械操作、半机械操作和必要的手工劳动适当地结合起来”的指示，看成是这三种形态静止的结合，而不是理解为必须积极地使每一种形态都尽可能快地向比较高级的形态发展。这种人的错误同样是由于思想落后于实际，看不到生产大跃进的形势逼人，看不到技术革命必须用尽可能快的速度来进行，否则就不能保证生产力的高速度发展。这些人要深入到实际中去，听听群众的意见，从而改变自己的认识，充当技术革命中的促进派，积极地使手工劳动尽可能快地发展成为半机械化，半机械化劳动尽可能快地发展成为机械化。
    劳动力不足的问题是当前工农业生产跃进当中出现的一个具体问题。究竟劳动力能不能增加呢？我们对这个问题的回答是完全肯定的。这就是要进一步改善生产关系和加速技术革命。这两个重大的问题是属于方针性的问题。积极地解决这两个重大的方针问题，将进一步加快整个经济的发展速度。我们促进生产跃进，而生产的跃进又逼着我们及时地去解决各色各样的新问题，从而使生产有更大的跃进。这就是我们促进派和不断革命论者的道路，也就是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的道路。
