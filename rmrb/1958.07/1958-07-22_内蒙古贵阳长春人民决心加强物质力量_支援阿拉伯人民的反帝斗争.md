Yesterday, at the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, steelworker Tong Zhankui shouted: We will never allow imperialism to run rampant. If U.S. and British imperialism dare to continue to interfere in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern people, we will resolutely fight back together with the people of the world and beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding! Workers, farmers, herdsmen, intellectuals, and others of various ethnic groups in Hailar, Chifeng, Bayanhot, and Yikezhao League expressed their determination at the conference to strengthen the forces of peace and support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Middle Eastern people with practical actions such as implementing the general line, developing industry on a large scale, producing more iron and steel, and striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

This afternoon, more than 5,000 herdsmen, workers, soldiers, cadres, students, and lamas from the Xilin Gol grasslands held up banners such as "U.S. and British Imperialism, Get Out of the Middle East!" and rallied and paraded in Xilinhot. Mongolian herdsmen women holding babies came out from the crowd and shouted: "We firmly stand with the Arab people and do not allow U.S. and British imperialism to play with fire!"

Religious figures in various parts of Inner Mongolia have also held forums and participated in demonstrations in recent days.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 19th: The U.S. and British imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has enraged the people of Guiyang City, a mountain city in southwestern China. Yesterday afternoon, more than 12,000 people from the city gathered, and 18 representatives, representing workers, farmers, students, the scientific community, religious figures, ethnic minorities, and democratic parties, angrily condemned the aggressive behavior of U.S. and British imperialism at the meeting. Gao Wenqing, an advanced producer who once created seven types of molds that increased efficiency by more than a thousand times, said on behalf of the workers of Guiyang City, "We workers in Guiyang City regard the national liberation struggle of the Arab countries as our own struggle." He expressed his intention to continuously create miracles in production and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland to support the struggle of the Arab people. Agricultural labor model Yang Yuqing, representing the suburban farmers, expressed his full support for the just struggle of the Arab people against imperialism.

Li Du, Secretary of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting that the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution broke the chains of imperialism in the Middle East and was a major victory for the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people in the world. He solemnly warned the U.S. and British imperialist aggressors that they must quickly withdraw their invading troops, otherwise they would suffer a shameful defeat.

Liu Meiting, a worker representative from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said at the meeting that we believe that the torch of opposition to imperialism raised by the people of Middle Eastern countries will surely burn U.S. and British imperialism to a frazzle.

Representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, the science and technology community, the literary and art circles, Islam, and the Young Pioneers also spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously demanded that the U.S. and British invading troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan.
