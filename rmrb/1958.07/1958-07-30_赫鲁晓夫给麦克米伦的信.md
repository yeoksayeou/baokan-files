Khrushchev's Letter to Macmillan

Prime Minister,

I have received your reply of July 26th to my letter regarding the convening of a summit conference.

I regret that you have not only failed to express your agreement to the special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government that you proposed on July 22nd to be held on July 28th, but have also failed to designate any recent date for holding this meeting. Now you are instead advocating that the permanent representatives of the Security Council member states discuss the date for holding an ordinary meeting of the Security Council.

Your position is a clear departure from the proposal you made in your letter of July 22nd. At that time, you explicitly expressed your hope that "Heads of Government could find opportunities for rapid meeting and discussion of the Middle East question," and said you were willing to go to New York to attend a special meeting of the Security Council if the head of the Soviet government also went there. You made suggestions on how the heads of government should discuss this issue at a special meeting of the Security Council, saying that they should not put forward any resolutions that had not been agreed upon in advance. The purpose of our joint work will be to reach a fruitful agreement, not to determine differences through voting. The Soviet government fully agreed to all your suggestions.

It is now clear that the British government is delaying the convening of the summit conference and is unwilling to take urgent measures to peacefully resolve the military conflict in the Middle East and Near East region.

It must be pointed out that your expression in the July 22nd letter of agreeing to convene a summit conference within the framework of the United Nations Security Council was welcomed by all countries. The results of consultations between the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, and India on the issue of a meeting of heads of government gave some comfort, and the people of all countries had every reason to expect that this meeting would be convened soon and guarantee the maintenance and consolidation of peace in the Middle East and Near East.

Your current answer is a step backward from the agreement reached and, therefore, cannot but cause serious concern among the people of all countries. Now the British government suggests that it is not necessary for the heads of government of the five countries to discuss the Middle East and Near East situation, which endangers the cause of peace, but instead advocates resubmitting this issue to an ordinary meeting of the United Nations Security Council. But what will be the result of this? You know very well that the Security Council has spent a long time discussing the situation in Jordan and Lebanon, but so far without any result.

Now, the issue of stopping armed aggression in the Middle East and Near East is particularly acute. Judging from the experience of recent meetings of the Security Council, its regular meetings are powerless to make swift and effective decisions on this issue.

Armed forces are constantly being concentrated in this region, and this region is increasingly becoming a powder keg that can be ignited and could cause a world disaster. In this situation, a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, must be convened immediately. Because they possess high authority and are able to reach an agreement on immediately stopping the military conflict in the Middle East and Near East and on taking measures to maintain and consolidate world peace.

It is quite clear that if we sincerely hope to find ways to ease the tense situation, then we should agree that, in this situation, these five countries should first agree on the necessary measures to maintain and consolidate peace. If these five countries reach an agreement on immediately stopping the armed conflict in the Middle East and Near East, then any other country that is truly concerned about consolidating peace will welcome and support this decision. Can anyone doubt this?

Your proposal on July 22nd to convene a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council precisely stipulated the nature of this summit conference, making it possible for us to conduct joint consultations not merely through formal procedures. In order to quickly resolve the pressing issue of stopping the armed conflict in the Middle East and Near East, we agreed to your proposal. However, as I have already pointed out, you, Prime Minister, are now deviating from this proposal.

It is impossible not to think that Britain's alliance with some countries and its own participation in armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries has influenced its position on the issue of arranging a summit conference. Therefore, the British government has shown a passive attitude and does not want to reach a resolution to ease the tense situation in the Middle East and Near East. It can be pointed out that your proposal on July 22nd to hold a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council could have achieved appropriate results if it had indeed been seriously implemented. But the whole problem is that you have deviated from this proposal and retreated, and have made us feel that you are looking for excuses to bury your own proposal, using empty talk about procedural issues to cover up further expansion of aggression.

It cannot be ignored that the approach being taken is to bury the agreement already reached on convening a summit conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India as soon as possible.

We cannot accept this.

The Soviet government adheres to the position of fighting for the maintenance and consolidation of peace, and adheres to the position of peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems. The Soviet government has consistently advocated resolving conflicts through peaceful means through negotiations. Therefore, we now also firmly advocate immediately stopping aggression and firmly advocate the rapid withdrawal of intervention troops from Jordan and Lebanon.

We firmly believe that as long as all parties have this sincere desire, the meeting of heads of government can find ways and possibilities to eliminate military conflicts, thereby bringing peace to the Middle East and Near East region.

In this regard, the Soviet government expresses satisfaction with the opinions expressed by the head of the French government, Mr. de Gaulle, in his letter of July 26th. He expressed support for the proposal to immediately convene a summit conference of the five countries, and we believe that his opinions are not different from the proposals made by the Soviet government on this issue. We believe, as previously stated, that this is the most correct way to ensure the most rapid resolution of the pressing task of stopping the military conflict in the Middle East and Near East.

Prime Minister, I speak frankly that the policy adopted by the US and British governments is essentially a policy of rejecting a summit conference, which cannot but cause concern among the people of all countries, because the people of all countries are anxiously waiting for an end to the armed conflict in the Middle East and Near East and for measures to maintain and consolidate universal peace.

Public opinion in all countries raises a question: Do the governments responsible for the current tense situation in the Middle East and Near East want to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries and secretly plot new acts of aggression? The landing of new batches of British troops in Jordan, the increasing number of British troops gathering in Cyprus, and the intention to transfer them to Arab Eastern countries all prove this. The British government is clearly aware that US troops continue to land in Lebanon, the US Navy continues to gather in the Eastern Mediterranean, and US reinforcements continue to be airlifted from Europe to the Middle East and Near East, especially to the Adana region of Turkey. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is that Turkey itself has recently been extensively preparing for armed intervention in the affairs of Arab Eastern countries. King Hussein of Jordan, who has lost the support of his own people and relies on foreign aid, dares to threaten with force, threatening to march on Baghdad. Now it can be seen that there is a clear tendency to expand the area of aggression. The threat of military attack looms over the Republic of Iraq.

It can be seen that delaying negotiations on a summit conference of the five countries, and at the same time increasingly gathering armed forces in the Middle East and Near East, will lead to further sharpening of the situation, lead to the expansion of the conflict, and may expose mankind to disaster.

Can we ignore the fact that the British and American governments, instead of withdrawing foreign troops from Jordan and Lebanon, are going full steam ahead to prepare for armed intervention in the internal affairs of the Republic of Iraq, and instead of hesitating to convene a summit conference, are eagerly holding a meeting of member states of the Baghdad Pact in your capital, London? All of this is clearly a conspiracy against Arab countries. Isn't this approach using the policy of implementing a fait accompli to put the world in the face of an ever-expanding military conflict?

Can we not consider the serious consequences of this policy, first of all, for its planners? Because in our era, the people of all countries are fully vigilant and will not tolerate acts of aggression.

At the same time, the British government, following the United States, is trying its best to obstruct the resolution of the current main issue that all mankind expects to be resolved—the issue of stopping US and British armed intervention in the Middle East and Near East. The British government is attempting to introduce the negotiations on the summit conference into the maze of endless discussions on the form and procedure of the conference.

Therefore, the path taken by the British and American governments is not to resolve the military conflict that has already begun in the Middle East and Near East, so as to maintain and consolidate peace, but to lead things to expand the area of military conflict and expose mankind to the threat of world disaster, even though the British government tries to adapt to circumstances and pretends that it still adheres to its proposal of July 22nd. Therefore, Prime Minister, you must bear serious responsibility to humanity and history for the consequences of this policy of the British government.

In view of the current extremely tense situation in the Middle East and Near East, the Soviet government still believes that it is necessary to immediately convene a summit conference of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, and India with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General.

The Soviet government requests the British and American governments to re-discuss the holding of this summit conference based on the proposals you made on July 22nd, which have been agreed upon.

As for the location of this meeting, we have noted what the head of the French government, Mr. de Gaulle, said in his letter of July 26th that he hopes that the meeting will be held in Europe. The Soviet government had previously advocated that the meeting be held in Europe, and therefore fully supports Mr. de Gaulle's suggestion.

Since the American newspapers have issued calls saying that if the meeting is held in the United States, the American authorities will encounter difficulties in ensuring the safety of the heads of government, this makes it especially necessary to consider holding the summit conference in a city in Europe.

We do not want to put the US government in a difficult situation on this issue. Therefore, while the Soviet government still does not oppose holding the meeting in New York, it also agrees to hold the meeting in Geneva, Vienna, Paris, or any other location that can be accepted by all participating countries.

We also welcome reaching an agreement on holding the summit conference in Moscow. The Soviet government will guarantee the absolute safety of the delegations of all countries and provide the conditions necessary for conducting fruitful work. We believe that the Soviet people will welcome the envoys who come here to take urgent measures to stop the conflict in the Middle East and consolidate world peace, and the Soviet people will thereby demonstrate their firm faith in the cause of peace.

Your letter avoids mentioning the issue of the Indian Prime Minister's participation in the summit conference. In this regard, I think it is necessary to emphasize once again that India's participation in the above-mentioned conference is of great significance for reaching a constructive decision to resolve the situation in the Middle East and Near East.

As for the date for holding the summit conference with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, we proposed to hold it on July 28th. Since, as can be learned from your letter, the date we suggested did not satisfy the British government, we are willing to find another recent date and hope to receive a clear answer: when is the British government willing to participate in the summit conference of the five countries?

Prime Minister, I hope you can reply to me as soon as possible.

With respect,
N. Khrushchev
July 28, 1958

### 赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的信

1958-07-30
第3版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给麦克米伦的信首相先生：
    我收到了您7月26日寄出的对我关于召开政府首脑会议的那封信的回信。
    我感到遗憾的是，您不仅没有表示同意您在7月22日所建议的有政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议在7月28日就举行，而且也没有为举行这个会议指定任何最近的日期。现在您反而主张由安全理事会会员国常任代表来商议举行安全理事会普通会议的日期。
    您的这种立场显然背离了您在7月22日信中所建议的主张。那时您明确表示希望“政府首脑能够寻找机会来迅速会晤和讨论中东问题”，并且说您愿意到纽约去参加安全理事会特别会议，如果苏联政府的首脑也到那边去的话。您对政府首脑在安全理事会特别会议上讨论这个问题的方法提出了意见，您说，他们不应提出任何未经事先商妥的决议。我们共同工作的目的将是达成会有成效的协议，而不是通过表决来确定分歧。苏联政府完全同意了您的一切建议。
    现在很清楚，英国政府是在拖延政府首脑会议的召开，不愿意这个会议采取紧急措施来和平解决中近东地区所发生的军事冲突。
    不能不指出，您在7月22日信中说您同意在联合国安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议，这个表示受到了各国的欢迎。苏联、英国、美国、法国和印度关于政府首脑会晤问题的协商结果使人得到某些安慰，各国人民完全有理由期待这次会议于最近召开并且保证维护和巩固中近东的和平。
    您现在的回答是从已达成的协议后退一步，因此自然不能不引起各国人民严重忧虑。现在英国政府建议，不必由五国政府首脑讨论危及和平事业的中近东局势，而主张把这个问题重新提交联合国安全理事会的普通会议。但是这能得到什么结果呢？您知道得很清楚，安全理事会已经花很长时间讨论过了约旦和黎巴嫩的局势，然而迄今毫无结果。
    现在，制止对中近东的武装侵略这一问题是特别尖锐的。从安全理事会近来所举行的会议的经验看来，它的常会无力就这个问题作出迅速有效的决定。
    在这一地区正在不断集结武装力量，这一地区日益变成一触即发并可能引起世界灾难的火药库。在这种情况下，必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、英、美、法和印度五国政府首脑会议。因为他们拥有高度的权力，能够就立即停止中近东地区的军事冲突和就采取维护和巩固世界和平的措施达成协议。
    十分清楚，如果我们真诚希望找寻缓和紧张局势的途径，那末我们就应当同意，在这种情况下，这五个国家首先应当议定维护和巩固和平的必要措施。如果这五国就立即停止中近东地区武装冲突达成协议，那末真正关心巩固和平的任何其他国家都会欢迎和支持这个决定。这一点难道有谁会怀疑吗？
    您7月22日提出的在安理会范围内召开政府首脑会议的建议恰恰是规定了这种政府首脑会议的性质，使我们可能不仅仅通过正式形式来进行共同协商。我们为了迅速解决停止中近东武装冲突这一迫切问题，同意了您的这个建议。但是，正如我已经指出的，您首相先生现在背离了这个建议。
    不得不认为，英国同一些国家的联盟以及它本身也参与了对阿拉伯国家内政的武装干涉这一点，影响了它在安排政府首脑会议这个问题上的立场，因此英国政府表现了消极被动态度，不想达成缓和中近东紧张局势的决议。可以指出，您7月22日提出的在安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议的建议如果的确能认真加以贯彻，本来是可以取到适当成果的。但是全部问题在于，您背离这个建议而后退了，并且使我们觉得，您在寻找借口来埋葬自己的建议，利用关于程序问题的空谈来为进一步扩大侵略打掩护。
    不能不看到，这样一来，所采取的方针就是要葬送已取得的关于尽快召开苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议的协议。
    我们是不能接受这一点的。
    苏联政府坚持为维护和巩固和平而斗争的立场，坚持社会经济制度的不同的各国和平共处的立场。苏联政府始终如一地主张通过谈判用和平的手段来解决冲突。因此，我们现在也坚决主张立即制止侵略，坚决主张干涉军迅速撤出约旦和黎巴嫩。
    我们坚信，只要各方面都有此衷心期望，政府首脑的会见可以找到消除军事冲突的途径和可能，从而使中近东地区得到安宁。
    在这方面，苏联政府对法国政府首脑戴高乐先生在他7月26日的信中所陈述的意见，表示满意。他表示支持关于立即召开五国政府首脑会议的建议，我们认为，他的意见同苏联政府就这个问题所提出的建议没有分歧。我们认为，正如以前所声明过的，这是能够保证最迅速地解决停止中近东军事冲突这一迫切任务的最正确的途径。
    首相先生，我直言不讳地说，美英两国政府所采取的方针实质上是拒绝政府首脑会议的方针，这不能不引起各国人民的不安，因为各国人民焦急地期待着能够结束中近东的武装冲突，并采取维护和巩固普遍和平的措施。
    各国舆论界人士提出一个问题：应对中近东当前的紧张局势负责的各国政府是否想要麻痹各国人民的警惕性，偷偷地策划新的侵略行动。一批批新的英国军队在约旦登陆，越来越多的英国军队在塞浦路斯集结，并打算调往阿拉伯东方国家，这些情况都证明了这一点。英国政府清楚地知道，美国军队继续在黎巴嫩登陆，美国海军继续在地中海东部集结，美国增援部队继续从欧洲空运到中近东，特别是空运到土耳其的亚达那地区。这方面值得特别注意的还有：土耳其本国最近也在广泛地准备武装干涉阿拉伯东方各国事务。丧失了本国人民支持和依靠外国帮助的约旦国王侯赛因竟敢用武力进行威胁，扬言要向巴格达进军。现在可以看到有扩大侵略区的明显趋势。军事进攻的威胁笼罩着伊拉克共和国。
    由此可见，拖延五国政府首脑会议的谈判，而且同时在中近东日益大量集结武装部队，这样就会导致局势的进一步尖锐化，导致冲突的扩大，并且可能使人类遭到灾难。
    英国和美国政府不从约旦和黎巴嫩撤退外国军队反而开足马力准备武装干涉伊拉克共和国内政，对召开政府首脑会议迟迟不决反而迫不及待地在贵国首都伦敦举行巴格达条约成员国会议，难道可以无视这个事实吗？这一切分明是对阿拉伯国家的阴谋。这种做法难道不是用执行既成事实的政策的办法使世界面临日益扩大的军事冲突吗？
    难道能不考虑这种政策首先对它的策划者所产生的严重后果吗？因为在我们这个时代各国人民是充分警惕的，是不会容忍侵略行动的。
    同时，英国政府跟在美国后面正竭力阻挠解决全人类所期待解决的当前主要问题——停止美国和英国在中近东的武装干涉问题。英国政府企图把关于政府首脑会议的谈判引入无休止的讨论这个会议的形式和程序的迷宫中。
    因此，英国和美国政府所走的道路，并不是解决中近东已经开始的军事冲突，以维护和巩固和平，而是把事情引向扩大军事冲突地区，使人类面临世界灾难的威胁，尽管英国政府试图随机应变，装作它仍然坚持它7月22日的建议。因此，首相先生，您要为英国政府这种政策的后果对人类和历史承担严重责任。
    鉴于中近东地区当前极端紧张的局势，苏联政府仍然认为必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、英、美、法、印五国政府首脑会议。
    苏联政府要求英国和美国政府，重新根据你们在7月22日所提出的、并已取得一致意见的建议来商量举行这次政府首脑会议。
    至于举行这次会议的地点，我们已注意到法国政府首脑戴高乐先生在7月26日信中所说的他希望这次会议在欧洲举行这一点，苏联政府早先就主张这次会议在欧洲举行，因此完全支持戴高乐先生的建议。
    由于美国报刊已经发出呼声，说若是会议在美国召开，美国当局将在保障政府首脑的安全方面碰到困难，这样就尤其应该考虑在欧洲的某个城市里举行政府首脑会议的问题。
    我们不愿意使美国政府在这个问题上处于多难的境地。因此苏联政府一方面仍然不反对在纽约召开会议，同时也同意在日内瓦、维也纳、巴黎或者能为全体参加国接受的任何其他地点举行会议。
    我们也欢迎能就在莫斯科举行政府首脑会议这点达成协议，苏联政府将保障各国代表团绝对安全并提供为进行有成效的工作所必需的条件。我们相信，苏联人民将欢迎为了采取紧急措施以停止中近东冲突和巩固世界和平而来到这里的使者，苏联人民将借此表明他们对和平事业的坚定的信心。
    您的信中避而不谈印度总理参加政府首脑会议的问题。在这方面，我认为有必要再次强调指出，印度参加上述会议对达成解决中近东局势问题的建设性决定具有重大意义。
    至于举行有联合国秘书长参加的政府首脑会议的日期，我们曾提出在7月28日举行。既然，从您的信中可以了解到，我们所建议的日期没有使英国政府感到满意，我们愿意另外找一个最近的日子，并且希望得到明确的答复：英国政府愿意在什么时候参加五国政府首脑会议。
    首相先生，希望您能尽早给我回信。
                此致敬意　尼·赫鲁晓夫
