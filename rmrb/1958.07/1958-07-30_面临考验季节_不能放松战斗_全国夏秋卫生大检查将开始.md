    The Patriotic Health Campaign to eliminate the Four Pests and promote hygiene, under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels, has been launched successively throughout the country since last winter. After only seven or eight months, statistics up to the end of June show that nationwide, 1,248,080,000 rats, 1,259,370,000 sparrows, and 72,140,000 kilograms of flies and mosquitoes have been eliminated. Currently, about one-third of the cities and counties nationwide have achieved basic "Four-Without" status. Even in cities and counties that have not yet achieved "Four-Without" status, many advanced hygienic areas and units have emerged. Therefore, from a national perspective, the Four Pests have been greatly reduced, diseases have significantly decreased, and a new socialist atmosphere has emerged in both urban and rural areas.
    The current season is when the Four Pests reproduce in large quantities, and malaria, epidemic encephalitis B, gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and food poisoning are extremely prone to occur. It is also the critical moment when the campaign to eliminate the Four Pests and promote hygiene faces a test and enters a decisive battle. The slightest relaxation carries the risk of losing all previous gains. To this end, the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, has decided to organize a nationwide summer and autumn Patriotic Health Campaign inspection. The main contents of the inspection are: the elimination of the Four Pests and diseases, the handling of breeding conditions for the Four Pests, environmental hygiene, and personal hygiene. On the one hand, it is necessary to understand the situation in basic "Four-Without" areas, affirm achievements, and encourage advanced units. At the same time, it is also necessary to inspect areas where the campaign has been relatively poor and to play a promoting role.
    The central departments and organizations concerned all attach great importance to this inspection. Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including Shao Lizi and other members, will participate. Minister of Public Health Li Dequan, Vice Ministers Xu Yunbei, He Biao, and Wu Yunfu, and Assistant Minister Qi Zhonghuan will also personally participate. Responsible comrades from other departments such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Railways, the Health Department of the Military Commission, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Food, the Second Ministry of Commerce, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Red Cross Society of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences will also participate. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will also dispatch a large number of personnel to participate and conduct mutual inspections according to the competition agreement. Shaanxi Province has decided to dispatch more than ten cadres at the prefectural and county committee level to participate in the work of the inspection team. The country is divided into nine inspection groups, which will go to various places. Except for individual areas, the inspection will begin on August 1st and last for about twenty days.

    面临考验季节　不能放松战斗
    全国夏秋卫生大检查将开始
    本报讯　除四害讲卫生运动，从去年冬季开始，在各级党委亲自领导下，相继在全国各地展开。经过短短的七、八个月时间，到6月底的统计，全国就消灭了老鼠十二亿四千八百零八万只、麻雀十二亿五千九百三十七万只、苍蝇和蚊子七千二百一十四万公斤。目前全国已有三分之一左右的市、县实现了基本“四无”。就是还没有实现
  “四无”的市、县里也出现了不少卫生先进地区和单位。因此，从全国范围来看，四害已大大减少，疾病显著下降，无论城市和农村都出现了一股社会主义的新气氛。
    目前正是四害大量繁殖、疟疾、流行性乙型脑炎、胃肠传染病、食物中毒等疾病极易流行的季节，也正是几个月来除四害讲卫生运动面临考验、进入决战的紧要关头。稍一放松便有前功尽弃的危险。为此，中央爱国卫生运动委员会，根据中共中央、国务院的指示，决定组织一次全国范围的夏秋季爱国卫生运动大检查。检查的主要内容是：四害、疾病消灭情况、四害孳生条件的处理、环境卫生和个人卫生等。一方面要了解基本“四无”地区的情况，肯定成绩，鼓励先进，同时也要检查运动搞得还比较差的地区，起推动作用。
    中央各有关部门、各团体都很重视这次检查。全国政协有常委邵力子和其他委员多人参加。卫生部部长李德全、副部长徐运北、贺彪、伍云甫，部长助理齐仲桓也将亲自参加。其他部门如农业部、铁道部、军委卫生部、水利电力部、文化部、教育部、粮食部、第二商业部、全国总工会、妇联、共青团中央、中国红十字会、中国科学院、中国医学科学院等都有负责同志参加。各省、市、自治区也将抽调大批人员参加，根据竞赛的协议进行相互检查。陕西省已决定抽调地、县委级干部十余人参加检查组的工作。全国分成九个检查组，分赴各地，除个别地区外，都在8月1日开始检查，为期约二十天。
