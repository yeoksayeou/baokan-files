    A Little Knowledge:
    Sand - A Powerful Enemy of Water Conservancy
    Ziguang
    After reading the article "Strange Sand" in the May 12th supplement, it reminded me of sand. There is no essential difference between "砂" (shā - grit/sand) and "沙" (shā - sand). The character "沙" includes the water radical, which indicates the close relationship between sand and water, that is, sand in the water flow.
    Sand mainly comes from the land. After a heavy rain, one can see water rushing through the small ditches on the ground. The water flows rapidly, carrying the mud and sand from the sides of the ditches. Besides rainwater carrying sand from the land into the rivers, wind also has the same effect. However, the sand that wind carries to rivers is much less than that carried by rainwater.
    Sand in the water flow is generally divided into two types: suspended sediment and bed load. Suspended sediment is suspended in the water and does not sink. It flows downstream with the water. However, when the flow velocity decreases, the suspended sediment will also sink. Bed load is at the bottom of the river, pushed by the water flow, rolling or hopping along the riverbed. However, when the flow velocity increases, it can also be suspended in the water like suspended sediment.
    Sand is a powerful enemy of water conservancy, and it causes great harm to people. The river with the highest sediment content in the world is the Yellow River in our country. Under normal circumstances (multi-year average), the sediment content of the Yellow River water flow is: more than 40 kilograms of sediment per cubic meter of turbid water; at most, it reaches more than 400 kilograms of sediment per cubic meter of turbid water. With so much sand, and not all of it being carried to the sea, the Yellow River bed is constantly silting up. In many sections, the river water level is higher than the ground on both sides of the river, so once the levee collapses, both sides of the river become a watery realm.
    When we build a reservoir, the lifespan of the reservoir, in addition to being determined by the design and construction technology, is mainly determined by the amount of sediment coming from the water. If there is a lot of sediment, the lifespan of the reservoir will be shortened; if sediment can be prevented well, the lifespan of the reservoir can be extended. The same is true for canals. If the work of controlling sediment is not done well enough, the sediment will completely silt up the canals. Waterways are also threatened by sediment, and often after a flood, the waterways are greatly changed. Hydropower stations are also afraid of sediment entering.
    Although sand is a powerful enemy of water conservancy, we also have some scientific methods to subdue it. The methods to prevent sediment damage are: to carry out soil and water conservation in the upper reaches of the river and build some works (such as dams to intercept sediment washed down by rainwater) to reduce the amount of sediment entering the river. And the "turbidity current" method, which uses a stream of turbid water flowing into the bottom of the reservoir to remove sediment from the reservoir, and methods such as setting up diversion screens for diversion and sand prevention, are all relatively effective measures.

    水利的劲敌——沙
    紫光
    看过5月12日副刊上“奇怪的砂”一文后，使我联想到沙。“砂”和“沙”没有本质上的区别。“沙”字从水旁，这说明沙与水有着密切的关系，也就是水流中的沙。
    沙，主要来自陆地。当一场暴雨过后，人们可以看到地面上的小沟里都哗啦啦地流着水。水流得又急又快，把沟旁的泥砂也冲了下去。除了雨水能把陆地上的砂带到河道里成为沙以外，风力也有同样的作用。不过风力带给河道的沙比起雨水所带的要少得多。
    水流中的沙，一般分为两种：悬沙和底沙。悬沙是悬浮在水中而不下沉的。它随着水流往下游流去。但是当流速减低时，悬沙也会下沉。底沙在河底，它被水流推着沿河底滚动或跳动前进。但是，当流速加大时，它也像悬沙一样能悬浮在水中。
    沙是水利工作的劲敌，它给人们带来的害处是很大的。世界上含沙最多的河流是我国的黄河。在一般情况下（多年平均），黄河水流含沙量是：每一公方浑水中含有泥沙四十多公斤；最多时达到每一公方浑水中含有泥沙四百多公斤。含了这么多沙，又不能全部带到海里去，就使得黄河河床不断地淤高。出现了许多河段的河水面高出两岸地面的情况，因此只要大堤一溃决，两岸就变成了泽国。
    当我们修建一个水库时，这个水库的寿命除了决定于设计和施工的技术之外，更主要的是决定于来自水中的泥沙量。泥沙多，水库的寿命就会缩短；若能很好地防止泥沙，水库的寿命就能延长。渠道也是这样，如果对控制泥沙的工作做得不够的话，泥沙就会把渠道全部淤塞起来。航道也同样受到泥沙的威胁，往往一次洪水过后，航道就大大地改变了面貌。水电站也怕泥沙进入。
    沙虽然是水利的劲敌，但我们也有了一些科学的方法能够制服它。防止泥沙为害的办法是：在河道上游进行水土保持和建造一些工事（如用来拦截雨水冲来的泥沙的水坝等）来减少泥沙流入河道。以及利用潜入水库底部流动的一股浑水水流来排除水库中的泥沙的“异重流”法，和设置导流防沙的导流屏等方法，都是比较有效的措施。
