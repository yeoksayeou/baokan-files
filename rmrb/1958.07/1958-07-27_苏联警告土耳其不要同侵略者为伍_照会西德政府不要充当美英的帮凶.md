Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - TASS reports: On July 24th, the Soviet government delivered a memorandum to the Turkish government, in which it warned Turkey not to associate with aggressors, and not to take measures that would further exacerbate the situation in the Near and Middle East. Otherwise, Turkey would bear serious responsibility for any military conflict that might occur in the region.

The Soviet government pointed out in the memorandum that the Turkish Foreign Minister made an oral statement to the Soviet government on July 22nd on behalf of his government, guaranteeing that "Turkey will never take any measures that would aggravate the Middle East situation." However, the Soviet government believes that this statement by the Turkish government is inconsistent with the facts that illustrate Turkey's true policy towards recent events in the Near and Middle East.

The memorandum pointed out that the recent conversation of Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu with a reporter from the "Daily Mail" is particularly noteworthy. In this conversation, Zorlu said that Turkey fully supports Britain's actions in Jordan and hopes to extend this action to Iraq. At the same time, he also expressed that the British actions would receive Turkey's support. The memorandum stated that Zorlu's conversation cannot prove Turkey's peaceful intentions and directly contradicts the aforementioned statement by the Turkish government. The fact that Turkey provided the Adana military base to the United States, allowing the American troops that invaded Lebanon to gather there, also contradicts the aforementioned statement.

Reports from various locations indicate that the Turkish government has been preparing for military action against Iraq in recent days, and may use King Hussein's relevant appeal as an excuse for Turkish troops to invade Iraq. Since Turkey's aggression will inevitably be met with resolute opposition from the people of Iraq and other Arab countries, the Turkish government cannot achieve this action without direct support from the United States.

The memorandum said that it appears that the plan for Turkish troops to invade Iraq has only been temporarily delayed because a complete agreement has not yet been reached with the United States on this adventurous action, and because the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have expressed firm opposition to armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and have issued serious warnings to the aggressors about the planned armed offensive against Iraq and other Arab countries.

However, the situation in the region remains dangerous. The threat of aggression against Iraq has not been eliminated. According to available information, Turkey is calling up reservists, and Turkish troops are gathering in Tel Abyad, heading towards the Syrian and Iraqi borders, even though neither Syria nor Iraq has threatened Turkey.

The Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility to warn the Turkish government that it will bear serious responsibility for the possible consequences of a military conflict in the region. The memorandum hopes that Turkey will not associate with the aggressors, and hopes that it will not take any measures, either in words or in actions, that would exacerbate the situation in the Near and Middle East.

### 苏联警告土耳其不要同侵略者为伍  照会西德政府不要充当美英的帮凶

    苏联警告土耳其不要同侵略者为伍
    照会西德政府不要充当美英的帮凶
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府24日把苏联政府的一份备忘录交给土耳其政府。苏联政府在备忘录中警告土耳其不要与侵略者为伍，不要采取使中近东局势更加尖锐化的措施，否则，它要对这个地区可能发生的军事冲突负严重责任。
    苏联政府在备忘录中指出，土耳其外交部长22日曾经代表他的政府向苏联政府作了口头声明，保证“土耳其决不采取会加剧中东局势的任何措施”。但是，苏联政府认为，土耳其政府的这个声明，同说明土耳其对最近中近东的事件的真正政策的事实不符。
    备忘录指出，土耳其外交部长佐鲁最近对
  “每日邮报”记者的谈话特别引人注意。佐鲁在这次谈话中曾说，土耳其完全支持英国在约旦的行动，而且希望把这种行动扩大到伊拉克。同时，他还表示英国人的行动将得到土耳其的支持。备忘录说，佐鲁的这个谈话决不能证明土耳其的和平意图，而且直接违背土耳其政府的上述声明。土耳其向美国提供亚达那军事基地，让对黎巴嫩进行侵略的美国军队在那里集结，这一事实也是违背上述声明的。
    从各地传来的消息表明，近日来土耳其政府一直在准备对伊拉克采取军事行动，并且可能利用侯赛因国王有关的呼吁作为土耳其军队侵入伊拉克的借口。由于土耳其的侵略行动势必会受到伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家人民的坚决反对，土耳其政府没有美国的直接支持是不能够实现这种行动的。
    备忘录说，看来，只是因为还没有同美国就这个冒险行动达成完全的协议，因为苏联和其他爱好和平的国家对武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦、对正在策划中的武装进攻伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家表示了坚决的抗议并向侵略者提出了严重警告，土耳其军队准备入侵伊拉克的计划才暂时未能实现。
    但是，这个地区的局势仍然危险。侵略伊拉克的威胁并没有消除。据现有材料，土耳其正在召集后备军人，土耳其军队正在台阿贝格尔集结，开往叙利亚和伊拉克边境，尽管叙利亚或是伊拉克都没有威胁土耳其。
    苏联政府认为，它有责任警告土耳其政府要对这个地区发生军事冲突的可能后果负严重责任。备忘录希望土耳其不致与侵略者为伍，希望它不仅在口头上，而且在行动上不采取会使中近东局势尖锐化的任何措施。
