Jinan Dispatch -- In order to clear the obstacles to implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement, the rectification re-education of leading organs of the Shandong Provincial, Municipal, and Prefecture Committees has been fully launched. The rectification re-education of leading organs at the county level is also being carried out one after another during the break of the summer harvest and summer planting, according to the specific conditions of each locality.

This rectification re-education takes the elimination of right-leaning opportunism, localism, sectarianism, and decentralism as its central content, with a focus on leading cadres of leading organs above the county level. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee requires that all units where the anti-rightist and anti-right-leaning struggles were not thorough in the past must be resolutely deepened and thoroughly carried out in this key re-education. No unit or leading cadre should slip through this movement.

The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has taken a leading role in this rectification re-education. Over the past half-month, it has held several enlarged meetings to conduct serious criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings and errors of the Standing Committee members in implementing the central government's policies and the Provincial Party Committee's resolutions. All units have also resolutely implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on rectification re-education. Many units directly under the province mostly began by examining whether the implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee was resolute and serious, and then turned to criticizing key figures. All cadres participating in the meeting used the methods of extensive airing of views, big-character posters, presenting facts, reasoning, and using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, both to conduct serious criticism of comrades who had committed errors such as localism, sectarianism, and decentralism, and to examine their own shortcomings in the past of lacking principle and not launching a resolute struggle against these principled issues.

Through this re-education, some serious problems existing among some leading cadres in the leading organs of the Shandong Provincial, Municipal, and Prefecture Committees have been exposed. The meeting of Party Group Secretaries of various departments and bureaus of the Shandong Provincial People's Committee, after more than a month of criticism, revealed an anti-Party right-wing group. Some of the main members of this group opposed the Party's general line for socialist construction, negated the superiority of the socialist system, often refused to implement the instructions of relevant central departments under various pretexts, shielded rightists, monopolized the power of finance, grain, and trade, and created a financial deficit to attack the Provincial Party Committee. Organizationally, they formed their own system, openly clamoring: "The Provincial Party Committee is in the Provincial People's Committee," attempting to turn the departments they led into independent kingdoms. At the meeting of responsible party cadres in Jinan Municipality in recent days, the serious errors of the former main responsible cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, such as being arrogant to superiors, domineering to subordinates, promoting localism, consistently resisting the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and spreading anti-Party remarks everywhere, have also been initially exposed. Other prefectural and municipal party committees have also carried out re-education according to their respective priorities. The Huimin Prefectural Party Committee spent a considerable amount of time continuing to thoroughly criticize Comrade Li Feng, the former First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, for opposing the Central Committee and Chairman Mao's principles on correctly handling contradictions among the people, his domineering Kuomintang style, and his serious errors in establishing an independent kingdom. The Tai'an Prefectural Party Committee recently launched a deeper criticism of Comrade Cao Liqin, the former Acting First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, for opposing the Central Committee and Chairman Mao's principles on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and attacking the Provincial Party Committee for being "right-leaning." Prior to this, the Heze Prefectural Party Committee exposed an anti-Party right-wing group headed by Hu Guohua, the former Deputy Secretary and Commissioner of the Prefectural Party Committee; the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee exposed an anti-Party right-wing group headed by Sun Hanqing, the former Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat. Some responsible cadres of other prefectural and municipal party committees are also examining their own right-leaning conservative thinking, localism, sectarianism, and other erroneous thoughts and behaviors.

The many serious facts revealed in the rectification re-education have given the broad masses of cadres a practical and profound education, making everyone more clearly aware of the great significance of earnestly carrying out rectification re-education in ensuring the implementation of the general line for socialist construction. On the basis of improved ideological understanding, many cadres have more resolutely plunged into this struggle. In addition to actively speaking at various meetings, they have also widely used the powerful weapon of big-character posters. According to incomplete statistics from the various departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, more than 10,000 big-character posters have been written in more than a month. At present, the rectification re-education movement in Shandong Province is continuing to develop in depth. The Provincial Party Committee's determination is: we will never withdraw our troops until we achieve complete victory.

    山东各级机关进行整风补课揭
    露出一些窃据领导职位的反党右派集团
    本报济南电　为了给贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线扫清障碍，争取整风全胜，山东省、市、地委领导机关的整风补课已经全面展开；各县领导机关的整风补课也正依据各地的具体情况，抓紧夏收夏种的间隙先后进行。
    这次整风补课是以肃清右倾机会主义、地方主义、宗派主义、分散主义为中心内容；以县以上领导机关的领导干部为重点。山东省委要求，凡是过去反右派、反右倾不彻底的单位，都必须在重点补课中坚决搞深搞透。不要有一个单位、一个领导干部，在这个运动中滑过。
    山东省委常委在这次整风补课中起了带头作用。半个多月来，举行了多次扩大会议，对常委委员在贯彻中央方针、政策和省委决议方面的缺点和错误，展开了严肃的批评和自我批评。各单位也都坚决贯彻了省委关于整风补课的指示。省直属的许多单位开始大都检查了执行中央和省委指示是否坚决认真，然后转到对重点人物进行批判。所有参加会议的干部都以大鸣大放、大字报的方法，摆事实、讲道理，运用批评和自我批评的武器，既对犯有地方主义、宗派主义、分散主义等错误的同志进行了严肃的批判；也检查了自己在以往缺乏原则性，没有对这些原则性问题展开坚决斗争的缺点。
    通过这次补课，暴露了山东省、市、地委领导机关一些领导干部中存在的一些严重问题。省人民委员会各厅、局党组书记会议经过一个多月的批判，揭露出一个反党右派集团。这个集团的一些主要成员，反对党的社会主义建设总路线，否定社会主义制度的优越性，常常以各种借口拒绝执行中央有关部门的指示；包庇右派分子；独揽财粮贸大权，并制造财政赤字来攻击省委；在组织上自成系统，公然扬言：“省委就在省人委”，企图把他们领导的部门变成独立王国。济南市委在连日来的党员负责干部会议上，也初步揭露了前市委主要负责干部长期以来对上傲慢、对下专横，宣扬地方主义，一惯对抗省委领导，到处散播反党言论等严重错误。其他各地、市委，也都依据各自重点进行补课。惠民地委曾以相当长的时间，继续彻底地批评了前地委第一书记李峰同志反对中央和毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，独断专行的国民党作风以及搞独立王国的严重错误。泰安地委最近再次就前代理地委第一书记曹礼琴同志反对中央和毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，攻击省委“右倾”等严重错误，展开更深入一步的批判。在此以前，菏泽地委揭露了以前地委副书记兼专员扈国华为首的反党右派集团；青岛市委揭露了以前市委书记处书记孙汉卿为首的反党右派集团。其他各地委、市委一些负责干部也正在检查自己的右倾保守思想、地方主义、宗派主义等错误思想和行为。
    整风补课中揭露出来的许多严重事实，使广大干部受到一次实际的深刻的教育，使大家更加清楚地认识到认真进行整风补课对保证执行社会主义建设总路线的重大意义。许多干部在思想认识提高的基础上，更加坚决地投入了这场斗争。他们除在各种会议上积极发言以外，还广泛运用了大字报这一有力武器。据省人民委员会各厅局的不完全统计，一个多月来写的大字报就有一万多张。现在，山东省的整风补课运动正在继续深入发展，省委的决心是：不获全胜，决不收兵。
