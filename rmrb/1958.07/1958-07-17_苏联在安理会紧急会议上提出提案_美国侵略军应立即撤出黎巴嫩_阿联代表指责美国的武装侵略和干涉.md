Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th -- The Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, proposed a resolution at the Security Council emergency meeting on the 15th, demanding that the United States cease its armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries and immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from Lebanon.

The proposal stated:

“The Security Council,

Having heard the report of the United States representative on the entry of United States armed forces into Lebanon, considers that such action constitutes gross interference in the internal affairs of the Arab peoples and is therefore contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in particular Article 2, paragraph 7, which prohibits intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state;

Considering that the actions of the United States seriously threaten international peace and security,

Demands that the United States Government cease its armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries and immediately withdraw its troops from the territory of Lebanon.”

This emergency meeting of the Security Council was convened at the request of the United States to discuss the so-called situation in Lebanon. In reality, the convening of this meeting was merely to present the United Nations with a fait accompli – the landing of U.S. armed forces in Lebanon. It is widely believed that the U.S. armed intervention in Lebanon is the first step in an armed aggression against Iraq, and also a preparation for a broader conspiracy by imperialist countries to strangle the national liberation movement in the entire Arab East and restore colonialist positions there.

On the same day, U.S. representative Lodge also submitted a proposal to the Security Council requesting the deployment of United Nations forces to Lebanon. The proposal requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to consult immediately with the Lebanese government and United Nations member states on the establishment and deployment of this force, and that governments provide “full cooperation” in the establishment of this force. It is clear that the reason the United States has taken this action is to give its armed intervention in Lebanon a veneer of legitimacy and to attempt to divert attention from the landing of U.S. troops in Lebanon.

The Security Council held two meetings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, that day. At the beginning of the morning meeting, Soviet representative Sobolev requested clarification of the credentials of the Iraqi representative, as there were reports that the newly established Iraqi revolutionary government had revoked the credentials of Abbas, the current Iraqi representative to the United Nations and the Security Council, and had appointed a new representative. However, with the support of the representatives of Western countries, the President of the Security Council, Araujo (Colombia), interrupted the discussion on the issue of Iraqi representation, citing the Secretary-General of the United Nations’ “explanation.”

The meeting then proceeded to discuss the so-called situation in Lebanon.

U.S. representative Lodge spoke first. He repeated Eisenhower's statement regarding the dispatch of troops to Lebanon. He invoked the name of "traditional international law" and said that "stabilizing the situation in Lebanon" was the sole purpose of the landing of U.S. armed forces in that country. But he also said that the revolutionary coup in Iraq created a "serious threat to security," which was clearly an attempt to prepare an excuse in advance for the use of force against the Iraqi people by the United States. Lodge called all revolutions and national liberation movements "covert aggression" and called for their suppression with "collective strength."

British representative Dixon said that his government fully supported the U.S.'s action of sending armed forces to the Near East. He also expressed serious concern about the growing national liberation movement in the Near East. He called on the United Nations to condemn and stop the so-called "extremely dangerous" trend in the region.

The representatives of France and Canada also supported the U.S.'s actions. The French representative also said that the French government reserved the right to "take any necessary measures" to protect French interests in Lebanon.

Soviet representative Sobolev then spoke. He pointed out that the United States had decided to openly interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries with armed forces, and wanted to subdue not only Lebanon, but also the people of other Arab countries who rose up to defend their freedom and independence. Sobolev said that this action was an intolerable violation of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits the use of force as a means of implementing foreign policy, violated the principles and norms of international law, and was a challenge to all freedom-loving humanity.

Sobolev then presented the Soviet proposal.

Arab United Republic representative Lutfi emphasized that there was no reason to convene an emergency meeting of the Security Council, and even less reason for U.S. troops to enter Lebanon. The United States requested the convening of the Council meeting only to present the Council members with a fait accompli.

The Arab United Republic representative pointed out that the fighting in Lebanon had subsided relatively in recent days, and that the landing of U.S. troops could only exacerbate the situation. The U.S. government’s unilateral decision was unjustified. Moreover, the Security Council had already made a decision on the Lebanon issue, which the United States itself had voted in favor of, and this decision was being implemented by United Nations observers. The action taken by the United States is an armed aggression and intervention in the internal affairs of a small country, which violates the United Nations Charter. Its actions create a dangerous precedent, and the U.S. government must be responsible for this decision, which is fraught with serious consequences.

The next meeting of the Security Council is scheduled for the 16th.

    苏联在安理会紧急会议上提出提案
    美国侵略军应立即撤出黎巴嫩
    阿联代表指责美国的武装侵略和干涉
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫15日在安全理事会紧急会议上提出一项提案，要求美国停止对阿拉伯国家内政的武装干涉，立即把它的侵略军队撤出黎巴嫩。
    提案说：
    “安全理事会
    听取了美国代表关于美国武装部队开入黎巴嫩境内的报告以后，认为这种行动是对于阿拉伯各国人民内政的粗暴干涉，因而违背了联合国宪章，特别是第二条第七款所规定的宗旨和原则：禁止干涉实质上属于任何国家内部权限的事务，
    考虑到美国的行动严重地威胁着国际和平和安全，
    要求美国政府停止对阿拉伯国家内政的武装干涉并且立即把自己的军队撤出黎巴嫩国境。”
    安全理事会这次紧急会议是根据美国的要求为讨论所谓黎巴嫩的局势问题而召开的。实际上这次会议的召开只不过是为了使联合国面临既成事实——美国武装部队在黎巴嫩登陆。人们普遍认为，美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉是对伊拉克进行武装侵略的第一步，也是帝国主义国家企图扼杀整个阿拉伯东方的民族解放运动和在那里恢复殖民主义阵地的更广泛的阴谋的准备。
    美国代表洛奇同一天也向安全理事会提出一项提案，要求派联合国部队到黎巴嫩。提案要求联合国秘书长立即就成立和派遣这支部队的问题同黎巴嫩政府和联合国会员国磋商，各国政府对于成立这支部队进行“充分的合作”。很明显，美国所以采取这个行动，是为了要给它对黎巴嫩的武装干涉披上合法的外衣，并且企图转移人们对美国部队在黎巴嫩登陆的注意。
    安全理事会这一天上、下午一共举行了两次会议。在上午会议开始时，苏联代表索波列夫曾经要求澄清伊拉克代表的资格问题，因为有消息说，新成立的伊拉克革命政府已经取消了现在驻联合国和安全理事会的伊拉克代表阿巴斯的全权资格，并且任命了新的代表。但是在西方国家代表的支持下，安全理事会主席阿劳霍（哥伦比亚）借口联合国秘书长的“解释”，中断了关于伊拉克代表权问题的讨论。
    会议接着讨论所谓黎巴嫩的局势问题。
    美国代表洛奇首先发言。重复了艾森豪威尔关于派军队到黎巴嫩去的声明。他盗用“传统的国际法”的名义说，“稳定黎巴嫩局势”是美国武装部队在这个国家登陆的唯一目的。但是他同时又说伊拉克的革命政变造成了“对于安全的严重威胁”，这显然是企图预先为美国对伊拉克人民采用武力准备借口。洛奇把所有的革命和民族解放运动一概叫作“不公开的侵略”，并且号召用“集体的力量”进行镇压。
    英国代表狄克逊说，他的政府完全赞同美国派武装部队到近东去的行动。他并且对近东日益增长的民族解放运动表示严重的忧虑。他要求联合国谴责和制止这个地区的所谓“极端危险”的趋势。
    法国和加拿大代表也支持美国的行动。法国代表还说，法国政府保留“采取任何必要措施”维护法国在黎巴嫩的利益的权利。
    苏联代表索波列夫接着发言。他指出，美国决定用武装部队公开干涉阿拉伯国家的内政，并且想不仅使黎巴嫩，而且也使其他阿拉伯国家起来捍卫自由和独立的人民屈服。索波列夫说：这个行动是对于禁止采用武力作为实行外交政策手段的联合国宪章的令人不能容忍的破坏，它违背国际法的原则和准则，并且是向全体爱好自由的人类的挑战。
    索波列夫接着提出苏联的提案。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表卢特菲强调说，没有任何理由召开安全理事会紧急会议，美国军队更没有理由开入黎巴嫩。美国要求召开理事会会议，只是为了使理事国面对既成事实。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表指出，最近几天黎巴嫩的战斗已经比较缓和，美国军队登陆只能使局势恶化。美国政府这一片面决定是没有任何道理的。况且安全理事会已经就黎巴嫩问题作出了决定，美国本身也曾投票赞成这项决定，而且这项决定正由联合国观察员付诸实施。美国所采取的行动是对一个小国内政的武装侵略和干涉，这种行动违反联合国宪章。它的行动创造了一个危险的先例，美国政府得对这一充满严重后果的决定负责。
    安全理事会下次会议定于16日举行。
