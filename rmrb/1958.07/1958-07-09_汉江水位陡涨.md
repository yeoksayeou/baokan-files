Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 8th: Due to continuous torrential rains in the upper reaches of the Han River, the water level of the Han River has risen sharply, with three flood peaks appearing in succession within a week. The Xiangyang and Jingzhou regions of Hubei Province in the middle and lower reaches of the Han River are under severe threat of flooding. At 23:00 on July 7th, the water level in Xiangyang reached 69.3 meters, exceeding the highest water level in 1954 by nearly one meter. It is expected that this flood peak will reach the Zhongxiang and Jingmen areas of the Jianghan Plain on the evening of the 8th. The people on both sides of the Han River have been tensely engaged in flood prevention efforts.

Nearly one million laborers in the counties along the river in the Xiangyang region, led by the county party secretaries and county heads of each county, have gone to the dikes to fight the flood.

In order to stem the rising flood, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Gate in the lower reaches of the Hanshui River was opened today for flood diversion.

    汉江水位陡涨
    据新华社武汉8日电  汉江上游连日暴雨，汉江水位陡涨，在一周内，连续出现三次洪峰。汉江中、下游的湖北襄阳专区和荆州专区已处在洪水严重威胁之下。7日晚二十三点，襄阳的水位已达六十九点三公尺，超过1954年最高水位近一公尺。预计这股洪峰将在8日晚到达江汉平原的钟祥、荆门一带。汉江两岸人民已紧张投入防汛斗争。
    襄阳专区沿江各县的近百万民工，在各县中共县委书记、县长率领下，上堤与洪水展开搏斗。
    为了制止洪水涨势，汉水下游杜家台分洪闸已在今天开闸分洪。
