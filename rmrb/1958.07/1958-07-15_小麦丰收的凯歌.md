Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 14th: Hubei Province farmers, who are constantly setting new high-yield records, are using clapper talk and poems to joyfully celebrate this year's unprecedented bumper wheat harvest, expressing their boundless joy.

    When 11 mu of wheat in the Happiness Cooperative of Cuiying Township, Guanghua County, reached a high-yield record of 3,215 jin per mu, the farmers optimistically and confidently sang a folk song: "Four thousand, five thousand are yet to come":

    “In the past, wheat was only a hundred jin,
    People said growing wheat wasn't worthwhile,
    The year before last, three hundred was top-notch,
    Every farmer was happy and smiling.
    Last year, a thousand jin was really rare,
    Everyone said the yield had broken the sky.
    This year, three thousand is a large area,
    Thinking carefully, there are still shortcomings.
    The land wasn't prepared well, and few weeds were hoed,
    Which means the yield hasn't reached its limit.
    This year, we'll put in another effort,
    Four thousand, five thousand are yet to come."

    According to the people's wishes, the New Atmosphere Fifth Cooperative of Miaotan Township, Gucheng County, then achieved the miracle of 5,467 jin of wheat per mu, and news of bumper harvests of more than a thousand jin was reported everywhere throughout the province. Please see how the farmers vividly describe the scene of the bumper wheat harvest:

      “In the past, I stood in front of the door,
    Green Peak Mountain was in front of my eyes;
    Today, I stand in front of the door,
    I only see wheat stacks, not mountains.
    The threshing ground is five or six times larger,
    The wheat stacks cover half the sky.
    Walking to the front of the stack and looking up,
    Ah! My hat slips off and hangs on my shoulder.”

    The scene of the Great Leap Forward’s bumper harvest made the well-informed old farmers extremely happy. A folk song from Gucheng goes:

    “Wang Anrong,
    Eighty-three,
    Pulling his grandson to stand by the field,
    Looking at the wheat ears, he forgets to eat,
    His eyes smile into a line.
    His grandson calls him to go home,
    He says to his grandson,
    Grandpa is old and wants to see something big,
    I won't eat; I want to watch for a few days.”

    The farmers, having reaped a bumper harvest, feel happy about their lives and always like to use comparisons between the old and the new to praise today's new society. The following is a folk song from Jun County:

    “In the old society, when the wheat was on the threshing floor,
    Rent and miscellaneous taxes swept it all away;
    Before the wheat season was over, there was nothing to eat,
    Every household suffered famine.
    Now the wheat is on the threshing floor,
    There's nowhere to store the old wheat and rice,
    The fresh wheat can't be eaten,
    It's dried in the sun and stored in the granary.
    Boxes and cabinets are full of wheat,
    Jars and pots are full of grain,
    Neighbors go to borrow boxes,
    Every family worries about where to store it.
    This is truly like oil and salt being as deep as the sea,
    And rice and flour piling up like mountains.”

    The farmers of the Happiness Cooperative in Guanghua County sang a folk song expressing their gratitude to the Party:

    “Wheat over a thousand is rare throughout the ages,
    The Happiness Cooperative broke the old calendar,
    One mu can harvest three thousand some,
    It's a miracle in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad.
    In the past, it was difficult for barren beaches to grow grass,
    The grain harvested wasn't enough to eat,
    Now barren beaches have become treasures,
    The wheat harvested can't be finished,
    Thanks to the wise Chairman Mao,
    Thanks to the Party's good leadership.”

    小麦丰收的凯歌
    据新华社武汉14日电　不断创造高额丰产的湖北省农民，用快板、诗歌欢唱今年小麦的空前大丰收，表达他们无比喜悦的心情。
    当光化县崔营乡幸福社十一亩小麦达到亩产三千二百一十五斤高产纪录时，农民们曾乐观自信地唱出了“四千五千在后边”的民歌：
    “过去小麦不过百，
    都说种麦合不来，
    前年三百是特等，
    个个农民喜开怀。
    去年千斤真稀罕，
    都说产量顶破了天。
    今年三千一大片，
    细想还是有缺点。
    地没整好草少薅，
    说明产量没到边。
    今年再鼓一把劲，
    四千五千在后边。”
    依照人民的心愿，接着谷城县庙滩乡新气象五社就出现了小麦亩产五千四百六十七斤的奇迹，而且全省各处都传来千斤以上的丰产喜讯。请看农民们怎样生动地描绘着小麦丰收景象：
      “往日我在门前站，
    青峰大山在眼前；
    今日我在门前站，
    只见麦垛不见山。
    麦场扩大五六倍，
    麦垛遮去半边天。
    走进垛前朝上看，
    呀！帽子溜掉挂在肩。”
    大跃进的丰收景象，使见多识广的老农惊喜不已，谷城一首民歌唱道：
    “汪安荣，
    八十三，
    拉着孙娃站地边，
    看看麦穗忘吃饭，
    两眼笑成一条线。
    孙娃喊他回家转，
    他对孙娃把话言，
    爷爷老了要见广，
    不吃饭我要看几天。”
    农民们得到丰收，感到生活的幸福，总喜欢用新旧对比来歌颂今天的新社会。下面是均县的一首民歌：
    “旧社会麦子上了场，
    地租杂税一扫光；
    麦天没过没吃的，
    家家户户闹饥荒。
    现在麦子上了场，
    陈麦陈米没处装，
    新鲜麦子吃不着，
    晒焦晒干装进仓。
    满箱满柜都是麦，
    满坛满罐都是粮，
    东西邻家去借箱，
    家家发愁没处装。
    这才是油盐深似海，
    米面堆山岗。”
    光化县幸福社的农民，用民歌唱出了他们对党的感激：
    “小麦上千古来稀，
    幸福社打破了老皇历，
    一亩能收三千几，
    古今中外算奇迹。
    过去荒滩难长草，
    打的粮食吃不饱，
    现在荒滩变成宝，
    收的麦子吃不了，
    感谢英明的毛主席，
    感谢党的好领导。”
