    A Successful Meeting
    By our correspondent Zhang Hua
    Recently, Yucun Township in Anguo County, Hebei Province, held a meeting of commune and team cadres. This meeting comprehensively utilized on-site visits, inspections and evaluations, and the leadership method of grasping the two ends to lead the middle. Many participants said that the meeting delved deeply into ideological problems, resolved them thoroughly, boosted morale, and taught methods.
    Yucun Township is a key township of the Anguo County Party Committee. Since the Great Leap Forward, cadres and masses of the township have carried out more than ten production sprints, overcome severe drought, and won an unprecedented bumper harvest in the summer. The more than 40,000 mu of autumn seedlings are strong and leafy, surpassing previous years. However, the cadres and masses of Yucun Township were complacent with the existing achievements. On the road to strive for the upstream, they slowed down their pace. At that time, many people believed that after working hard for more than half a year from dark to dawn, braving the stars and the sun, now that the wheat was in hand, they should take a breather. This relaxation of effort resonated with some commune and team cadres, and many urgent problems were delayed. At that time, a large amount of intercropped cotton urgently needed thinning, weeding, and cultivation. However, many cadres and members believed that delaying autumn seedlings due to harvesting wheat was a law that was unavoidable. At that time, corn and sorghum were approaching the development stage and urgently needed watering and fertilization. However, most of the labor in the township was concentrated on wheat harvesting and threshing, with a beehive of activity on the threshing floor and deserted fields. The management of autumn seedlings in most villages was not followed up in a timely manner.
    The Yucun Township Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the above situation and decided to hold an on-site meeting to solve the ideological problems of cadres and the masses and to promote field production management. Based on past experience, this meeting emphasized putting politics in command and focusing on the essentials. In view of the past evaluation and inspection having too many items, broad scope, and no focus, the on-site meeting only looked at the good and not the bad, and without the opposite, comparisons could not be made, and the ideological problems were not deeply and thoroughly resolved. It was decided that this meeting would only inspect the management of autumn seedlings, and comprehensively use on-site visits, evaluations and inspections, and the method of grasping the two ends to lead the middle. The meeting planned to inspect the crops of five villages, good, bad, and average, including Jijiazhuang, Qicun, and Yucun, and focus on inspecting Jijiazhuang and Qicun, two good and bad villages, to see production and examine ideology. In addition to the village and commune cadres above the production team leader in the township, some Party and League members were also absorbed, with a total of more than 1,000 cadres and the masses participating in the meeting.
    The meeting participants first inspected the autumn seedling management of Jijiazhuang Village. People saw in this village's farmland that all kinds of autumn crops had been fertilized and watered, the fields were wet, and the seedlings were particularly lush. The corn seedlings were chest-high, with thick stalks and leafy, and a large loudspeaker was twisted in the heart of the spike. The cotton had stretched out five or six fruit branches, had already budded in advance, and the thick branches and leaves covered the land, as flat as a mat, all green. The multi-spike sorghum had many tillers, and the sweet potatoes had long stretched out their vines. All kinds of crops were a head taller and darker than neighboring villages. People inspected the crops in this village and nodded in praise, all saying it was good.
    The meeting participants passed through the farmland of Liucun, Beihe, and Yucun to inspect the autumn seedling management of Qicun. They divided into several teams and groups, inspecting each piece of land. While inspecting, they also interviewed and recorded the growth status of each field and the specific leaders responsible for the team and commune. What people saw here was a different world. More than 600 mu of corn and sorghum had not yet been fertilized and watered, the ground was so dry that dust rose in the wind, and the seedlings were drooping their leaves due to drought, yellow and thin. More than 1,000 mu of crops were not cultivated in a timely manner, and weeds competed for growth, crowding the seedlings. The intercropped corn in the sweet potato field of the 27th Production Team was taller than the knee, but had not yet been thinned. People looked at the crops in this village and compared them with Jijiazhuang. The same land, two different crops, was shocking, and they lamented the backwardness of Qicun's autumn seedling management.
    After inspecting and visiting the crops, everyone gathered in Qicun for a meeting. On the venue, there were objects collected from the farmland. Here, there were bundles of weeds, withered and thin cotton seedlings, and corn seedlings more than two feet high that had not been thinned. Hundreds of objects were labeled, indicating which production team they came from and which commune and team cadres were responsible for their leadership and management. These objects formed a vivid exhibition that touched people's hearts. The participants also posted more than 200 big-character posters on Qicun at the meeting, expressing their feelings about the village's autumn seedling management. One big-character poster criticized the village cadres, writing: The Qicun commune cadres, sit on the mountain and command the tiger, work is just arranged, inspections are not in-depth, the seedlings are not well managed, how can the competition not be lost. The inspectors, targeting the slack mood of some female cadres who only cared about housework and not about crops, used a big-character poster to specifically criticize a League cadre. The big-character poster wrote: Zhou Caigu, put on the millstone, if you can't grind grain, what will you eat... The meeting put forward the question of why Jijiazhuang's crops were good and why Qicun's crops were bad, and asked each village to discuss and, in connection with its own commune and team, to examine production and ideology. The meeting also held a general debate on the basis of group discussions, with more than 20 cadres and the masses speaking enthusiastically, criticizing Qicun while examining themselves. In order to profoundly educate the masses, the participants also helped the cadres of Qicun, using high-powered broadcasts, street propaganda, door-to-door visits, and other methods, to tell the villagers of Qicun about the problems they saw during their inspection and visit.
    This meeting successfully used on-site visits, evaluations and inspections, and the leadership method of grasping the two ends to lead the middle, greatly helping cadres and the masses to improve their thinking. Zhou Renfu, the director of the Qicun commune, was still full of arrogance before the inspection visit, saying that all crows in the world are the same black, and everyone is just so-so. When he saw Jijiazhuang's autumn seedling management, before the gathering, he rode his bicycle back to the village to arrange production. The meeting examined ideology in light of production, effectively enlightening the political consciousness of cadres and the masses. When discussing, the cadres, Party members, and League members of Qicun uncovered errors and found the root causes, discovering three serious shortcomings: the conservative right-leaning ideology of the leading cadres, the lack of a strict criticism system in the branch, and the inability of the leading backbone to twist into a single rope. The mutual assistance at the meeting was also very successful. More than 20 people gave speeches at the general meeting, all criticizing Qicun in a comradely manner. Zhao Zijun, the secretary of the Hexi Village branch, criticized the secretary of the Qicun branch, saying, there are people outside of people, and there is heaven outside of heaven. At any time, we cannot be complacent in leading the masses to carry out socialist construction. He suggested that the Qicun branch establish a strict criticism system, regularly examine ideology, and lead the masses forward. The enthusiastic help of the people encouraged the cadres and Party members of Qicun. The branch secretary and more than 20 Party member cadres felt that they were slack and complacent, and they were sorry to the Party and the commune members. They were moved to tears and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes. The cadres and Party members of other villages and communes also found the direction of progress from the lessons of Qicun. Daying Village had always been depressed in its work, and it had carried the black flag in two evaluations. At this meeting, many production team leaders, Party members, and League members examined the leadership based on the experience of Qicun and criticized the decline of the commune director and the deputy secretary of the branch. The village cadres of Jijiazhuang, Liucun, and other villages with better production also learned from the production of Qicun the lesson that the proud must fail, and examined their ideology and work at the meeting. After the meeting, a surging ideological torrent of comparing with the advanced, striving to be advanced, and catching up with the advanced drowned out the original complacency and slackness.
    Not long after the meeting ended, a new look appeared in the autumn seedling management of the whole township. On the same night, more than 1,000 cadres and members of Qicun held a meeting of determination on the original venue. The commune members carried manure to the fields overnight, and sheds were built on the well platforms. People took turns resting and working, with the well working without the people resting. Commune cadres and Party members went deep into their production teams and groups, taking the lead in labor. The communes and teams established field headquarters, and the cadres ate and lived in the fields, staying close to the production site and directing production at any time. Other villages also held meetings on the way to dismissal, arranged for field seedling management, and acted overnight. In addition to starting up all the pumping machinery, Daying Village also rushed to repair 27 waterwheels, reversing the past backwardness. The whole township, men and women, old and young, put in motion, with the attendance rate reaching 170% of the whole and half labor force. The progress of production such as fertilization and watering was more than doubled compared to before. The fertilization, watering, and cultivation of more than 40,000 mu of autumn seedlings in the whole township was completed ahead of schedule after three days and nights of blitz.

    一次成功的会议
    本报记者  张华
    最近，河北省安国县淤村乡召开了一次社队干部会议。这次会议，综合的运用了现场参观、检查评比、抓两头带中间的领导方法。许多参加会议的人都说，这次会议思想问题挖的深，解决的透，鼓足了干劲，学习了方法。
    淤村乡是中共安国县委的重点乡，从生产跃进运动开始，全乡干部群众曾进行了十多次的生产突击，战胜了严重的干旱，赢得了夏季空前丰收。四万多亩秋苗，棵壮叶肥，也超过了往年。但是，淤村乡的干部群众却陶醉于已有的成绩。在力争上游的路途中，放慢了前进的脚步。当时，曾有许多群众认为，从黑夜到天明，熬星星晒太阳，从冬到夏的苦干了多半年，眼下麦子拿到手，应该喘喘气。这种松劲情绪，在部分社队干部中得到了共鸣，许多急待解决的问题便被拖下来。那时节，大量间作棉花急待定苗、锄草和中耕。但许多干部社员却认为收麦子误秋苗，已成定律，事所难免。那时候，玉米、高粮已近发育期，迫切需要浇水追肥，但全乡大部劳力集中在小麦收打上，麦场上一窝蜂，农田里冷清清。大部村庄的秋苗管理，都没有及时的跟上去。
    中共淤村乡党委研究了上述情况，决定召开一次现场会议，解决干部群众的思想问题，推动田间生产管理。根据过去的经验，这次会议强调政治挂帅，以虚带实。鉴于过去的评比检查项目多，方面广，没重点，现场会议只看好的不看差的，没有对立面不能作比较，解决思想问题不深不透的情况，确定这次会议只检查秋苗管理工作，并且综合运用现场参观、评比检查和抓两头带中间的方法来进行。会议计划检查姬家庄、齐村、淤村等五个好、差、一般村的庄稼，并重点检查姬家庄、齐村两个好、差村，看生产，查思想。这次会议除全乡生产队长以上的村社干部外，还吸收了一部分党团员，参加会议的干部群众共达千余人。
    会议参加者首先检查姬家庄村的秋苗管理。人们在这村的农田里看到，各种秋庄稼都追上了肥，浇过了水，农田湿漉漉的，禾苗格外的水凌。玉米苗子齐胸没人，秆粗叶肥，尖心里拧着大喇叭。棉花伸出了五六个果枝，已提前出蕾，肥密的枝叶罩住了土地，平的真像一令席，一片碧绿。多穗高粱分蘖多，甘薯早就伸出蔓。各样庄稼，都比邻村高一头，黑一色。人们检查了这村的庄稼，无不点头称赞，同声道好。
    参加会议的人群穿过流村、北河、淤村的农田，来检查齐村的秋苗管理。他们分成若干个队组，逐片逐块的进行检查。并且边检查，边访问，记录着每块田苗的生长状况和队、社的具体领导负责人。人们在这里看到的，却是另一种天地。六百多亩玉米高粱还没追肥浇水，地干得风动烟尘起，苗子旱得搭拉着叶，又黄又瘦。一千多亩庄稼苗没及时中耕，草苗争长，草挤着苗。第二十七生产队甘薯田的间作玉米，苗高过膝，还没定苗。人们看过这村的庄稼，和姬家庄一比较，同样土地，两样庄稼，无不触目惊心，感叹齐村的秋苗管理落后。
    检查参观了庄稼，就集合到齐村开会。会场上，摆列着人们从农田里采集的实物。这里，有一束束的杂草，有萎黄枯瘦的棉苗，还有二尺多高没定苗的玉米苗。几百件实物都带着标签，注明着它来自那个生产队，是那些社队干部包干领导管理的。这些实物，组成了一个生动的展览会，牵动着人们的心弦。参加会议的人们，还在会场上给齐村贴了二百多张大字报，发表他们对这村秋苗管理的观感。一张大字报批评村干部写道：齐村社干部，座山指挥虎，工作光布置，检查不深入，苗子管不好，竞赛怎不输。检查的人们针对一些女干部只顾家务不管庄稼的松劲情绪，用大字报指名批评了一个团干部。大字报写着：周采姑，套碾磨，打不了粮食你吃什么……。会议提出了姬家庄的庄稼为什么好，齐村的庄稼为什么坏，让各村进行讨论，并且联系本社本队，检查生产和思想。会议还在小组讨论的基础上进行了大会辩论，二十多名干部群众热烈发言，一面批评齐村，同时检查自己。为深刻的教育群众，参加会议的人们还帮助齐村的干部，用高房广播、街头宣传、登门访问等方式，把他们检查参观时看到的问题，告诉给齐村的社员群众。
    这次会议成功的运用了现场参观、评比检查和抓两头带中间的领导方法，大大地帮助干部群众提高了思想。齐村的社主任周仁甫，在检查参观前还骄气十足，说天下的老鸹一般黑，谁也是那么两下子。等他看了姬家庄的秋苗管理，没等集合，就骑上自行车赶回村去安排生产了。会议对照着生产检查思想，有效的启发了干部群众的政治自觉性。齐村的干部党团员在讨论时揭错误找根源，曾发现了领导干部思想保守右倾、支部没有严格的批评制度、领导骨干拧不成一条绳等三项严重缺点。会议上的互相帮助，也很成功。二十多个人的大会发言，都对齐村进行同志式的批评。河西村支部书记赵子君批评齐村的支部书记说，人外有人，天外有天，我们领导群众进行社会主义建设，任何时候都不能自满。他建议齐村支部建立严格的批评制度，定期的检查思想，领导群众前进。人们的热心帮助，激励了齐村的干部党员。支部书记和二十多党员干部，感到自己松劲自满，对不起党和社员群众，感动的流下了眼泪，表示决心改正错误。其他村社的干部党员，也从齐村的教训中找到前进的方向。大营村工作一贯消沉，两次评比扛黑旗。这次会上许多生产队长党团员，根据齐村的经验检查领导，批评了社长支部副书记的暮气。姬家庄流村等生产较好的村干部，也从齐村的生产中记取了骄者必败的教训，在会上检查了思想和工作。会后，一个汹涌澎湃的比先进、争先进、赶先进思想洪流，便把原来的自满松劲情绪，给淹没下去了。
    会议结束不久，全乡的秋苗管理就出现了新的面貌。齐村的一千多名干部社员，当天晚上便就着原来的会场召开了立志大会。社员们连夜打炕运肥，井台上搭起了窝棚，人们轮换着休息劳动，歇人不歇井。社干部和党团员深入自己的生产队组，带头劳动。社队建立起野外指挥部，干部在田里吃田里住，不离生产现场，随时指挥生产。其他村也在散会的路上开会，布置安排了田苗管理，连夜行动起来。大营村除开动起所有抽水机械外，又赶修了二十七辆水车，转变了过去的落后面貌。全乡男女老少投入了运动，出勤率达到了整半劳力的170％。追肥、浇水等生产进度，较前提高了一倍多。全乡四万多亩秋苗的追肥浇水中耕，经过三天的昼夜突击，就提前完成了任务。
