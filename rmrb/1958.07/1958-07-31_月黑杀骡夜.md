    Moonless Night of Mule Slaughter
    --According to a Beirut dispatch from United Press International on the 28th

    Pei Hua, Poem; Miao Di, Drawing

    By the roadside in Beirut city,
    American soldiers stand watch at night.
    Pitch black, nothing can be seen,
    Every rustle of grass, the environment, treacherous.
    Heart pounding, unable to stand firm,
    Yet must prick up ears and open eyes wide.
    Suddenly hearing footsteps in the distance,
    The whole body feels like being electrocuted.
    Hugging the gun, close to the ground,
    Teeth chattering, voice trembling:
    Quick, quick, quick, answer the password,
    No, no, no, do not come forward!
    The opposite side pays no attention, ignores all,
    Just keeps walking forward.
    Each step a sound, rhythmic,
    Each sound approaching the gates of hell.
    American soldiers scared out of their wits,
    In panic, firing dozens of rounds.
    Stop firing, prick up ears, and listen carefully again,
    All around, deathly silence, only themselves.
    The forward position reports an alarm,
    The officer, helpless, goes to the outpost.
    Picks up a flashlight and shines it,
    Turns out they shot a mule to death.

    月黑杀骡夜
    ——据美国合众国际社贝鲁特28日讯
    裴化  诗　苗地　画贝鲁特城大路边，美国大兵在值夜。一片漆黑看不见，风吹草动环境险。心惊肉跳站不稳，却须竖耳又睁眼。忽听远处脚步声，混身顿时像触电。紧贴地皮紧抱枪，牙齿对打声发颤：快快快快答口令，不不不不准向前！对面不理也不睬，一个劲儿走前来。一步一声有节奏，声声逼近鬼门关。美国大兵吓破胆，慌忙连放几十弹。停枪竖耳再细听，四周死寂自己在。前沿阵地有警报，长官无奈到前哨。拿起电筒照一照，原来打死骡一条。
