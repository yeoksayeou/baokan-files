　　Slash-and-burn Farming Becomes Intensive Cultivation, No Industry Becomes Commune-Run Industry
　　The Poverty and Backwardness of the Buyi Ethnic Group Will Become a Historical Relic

　　(Reported by our correspondent Lu Xinglun) A new situation of leaping development has emerged in agricultural and industrial production in the Buyi ethnic group's settlements in southern Guizhou Province. In the remote villages that formerly practiced slash-and-burn farming, a surge of agricultural technological revolution has begun. Counties that previously had no industry have miraculously built thousands of factories. The history of backwardness and poverty of the Buyi people has been replaced by a history of rapid development of socialist agriculture and industry.

　　The Buyi settlements include nine counties: Ceheng, Wangmo, Luodian, Libo, Zhenfeng, Huishui, Zhenning, Anlong, and Pingtang. These nine counties have a Buyi population of more than 630,000, accounting for more than half of the entire Buyi population.

　　The unprecedented agricultural production upsurge in this region was formed after the in-depth development of the socialist education movement. Hundreds of thousands of Buyi farmers first invested in large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation campaigns. From December of last year to May of this year, the number of ponds, weirs, ditches, and canals built in these nine counties surpassed the number built in the past thousands of years, ensuring water conservancy for the vast majority of farmland. According to statistics, the irrigated area was increased by 1,080,000 mu, and the improved irrigation area was 390,000 mu. Therefore, rice transplanting was carried out as usual this year despite the prolonged drought. The amount of fertilizer accumulated also greatly exceeded any previous year, averaging 61,000 jin per mu, more than ten times higher than last year. Zhenning, which accumulated the most fertilizer, reached 273,000 jin per mu.

　　While water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation surpassed historical records, farming systems and techniques also broke with convention. The sowing of rice, corn, and miscellaneous grains in the counties was basically completed by the beginning of May, generally half a month earlier than last year, and basically all underwent salt water and mud water selection. This year, because Buyi areas universally established agricultural technology training classes and established political, technical, and cultural integrated night schools, thousands of men and women farmers learned to use new-style plows. As a result, not only have all the double-wheeled, double-shared plows, previously called "hanging plows" and "sleeping plows," been put into use, but also 13,929 double-wheeled, double-shared plows, single-wheeled single-shared plows, and mountain plows were added this spring. Due to the widespread promotion of new-style plows, deep plowing has been universally implemented in farmland throughout the region; rice fields are generally plowed and harrowed three times. At present, more than 90% of the rice seedlings in the counties are planted using the triangular cluster planting method, basically eliminating the old phenomenon of large, sparse planting.

　　While agriculture is leaping forward, the Buyi people, under the leadership of the Party, have launched a high tide of mining and factory construction. According to statistics from industrial leadership departments, the nine counties plan to build a total of 47,108 factories of various types this year, including 269 key factories run by the county, 291 factories run by the district, and an average of more than ten factories run by each agricultural cooperative. At present, most of the factories run by the county and district are under intense construction, and a small number have been put into production. More than 60% of these factories directly serve agricultural production. In order to accelerate the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural production, each county has established a farm tool manufacturing plant. Fertilizer plants and iron, bamboo, and wood farm tool processing plants have been established in each district, township, and cooperative.

　　In developing local industry, various places have grasped the important link of iron smelting. The nine counties have now built 65 indigenous iron smelting plants, planning to build a total of 266 indigenous blast furnaces. The Yashui, Yangchang, and Gangdu iron plants in Huishui County, which were built earlier, began smelting in mid-June. After these iron plants are all put into production, they can not only meet the current needs of the Buyi people for producing various iron farm tools, but also supply other regions. With the establishment of iron smelting plants, the coal mining industry is also developing rapidly. There are seventy coal mines opened by the counties and districts alone. Libo County, which is rich in coal resources, has now opened three coal mine plants and is simultaneously carrying out indigenous coking, planning to produce 200,000 tons of raw coal and 20,000 tons of coke this year. In addition, a batch of newly built aluminum, manganese, mercury, and other mines in various places have also begun smelting. Factories that use wild plants as raw materials, such as those for baking rubber, pressing oil, and producing artificial cotton, are also being put into production one after another. After all the factories are put into production, they will powerfully change the production and living conditions of the Buyi people.

　　"The Buyi area is a good place, with high mountains and long rivers; for thousands of miles around, there are treasures everywhere." This is a song of praise from the Buyi people, praising the beauty and richness of their hometown. But before liberation, the production and life of the Buyi people were very backward. It was not until after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, that the Buyi people rapidly changed the agricultural production methods of "slash-and-burn farming and fallow cultivation." And from 1951, a number of local industrial plants and mines were established successively in Huishui, Luodian, Zhenfeng, Zhenning and other counties, providing important conditions for the local people to develop production and improve their lives. After the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture this spring, the Buyi people, under the leadership of local Party committees and people's governments at all levels, rapidly launched an unprecedentedly high-spirited movement to develop industrial and agricultural production.

### 刀耕火种变成精耕细作　没有工业变成社社办工业  布依族贫困落后将成历史陈迹

    刀耕火种变成精耕细作　没有工业变成社社办工业
    布依族贫困落后将成历史陈迹
    本报讯　记者鲁兴伦报道：贵州省南部布依族聚居地区，目前农业和工业生产已出现了飞跃发展的新局面。在过去刀耕火种的边沿村寨，开始掀起了农业技术革命的热潮。从来没有工业的县份，破天荒地建起了数以千计的工厂。布依族人民落后和贫困的历史，已由飞速发展社会主义农业和工业的历史代替了。
    布依族聚居区包括册亨、望谟、罗甸、荔波、贞丰、惠水、镇宁、安龙、平塘九个县份。这九个县共有布依族人口六十三万多人，占整个布依族人口数的二分之一强。
    这个地区空前未有的农业生产高潮，是在深入开展社会主义教育运动后形成的。几十万布依族农民，首先投入了规模巨大的修水利和积肥运动。从去年12月到今年5月，这九个县兴修的塘堰沟渠，胜过了几千年来所兴修的数量，使绝大多数的田土都有了水利保证。据统计，增加灌溉面积一百零八万亩，并改善灌溉面积三十九万亩。因而今年在久旱不雨的情况下，也照样进行水稻插秧。积肥数量也大大地超过历史上的任何年份，平均每亩达到六万一千斤，比去年也增加十倍以上。积肥量最高的镇宁，每亩施肥量竟达到了二十七万三千斤。
    在水利积肥都超过历史纪录的同时，耕作制度和耕作技术也打破了常规。各县水稻、玉米、杂粮的播种工作，5月初就基本结束了，普遍比去年提早半个月，而且基本上都进行了盐水和泥水选种。今年由于布依族地区普遍开办农业技术训练班，又建立了政治、技术、文化三合一的夜校，使成千上万的男女农民都学会了使用新式犁。这样一来，不但已把过去被称为“挂犁”“睡犁”的双轮双铧犁全部使用起来，而且今春又添置了双轮双铧犁、无轮一铧犁和山地犁一万三千九百二十九部。由于新式犁的普遍推广，各地农田普遍实行了深耕；稻田一般都是三犁三耙。目前各县90％以上的水稻秧苗，都是采用三角丛植法栽种的，基本消灭了旧的大窝稀植现象。
    在农业大跃进的同时，布依族人民在党的领导下掀起了开矿、办工厂的高潮。据工业领导部门统计，这九县计划今年兴办的各种工厂共四万七千一百零八个，其中县办的骨干工厂二百六十九个，区办工厂二百九十一个，每个农业社平均办十个以上。目前，县、区办的工厂，绝大部分正在紧张施工，有一小部分已投入生产。这些工厂60％以上都是直接为农业生产服务的。为了使农业生产加速实现半机械化和机械化，各县都建立了一个农具制造厂。各区、乡、社都建立了肥料厂、铁竹木农具加工厂。
    各地在发展地方工业中抓住了炼铁这一重要环节。这九个县现已兴建六十五个土法炼铁厂，共计划建土高炉二百六十六个。施工较早的惠水县雅水、羊场、岗度三个铁厂，已在6月中旬开始冶炼。这些铁厂全部投入生产后，不但可以适应布依族人民当前生产各种铁质农具的需要，还可以供应外区，随着炼铁厂的建立，采煤工业也在飞速发展。各地仅县、区开办的煤矿就有七十个。煤源丰富的荔波县，现已开办三个煤矿厂，并同时进行土法炼焦，计划今年生产原煤二十万吨，焦炭二万吨。此外，各地新建的一批铝、锰、汞等矿厂也开始冶炼。利用野生植物作原料的烤胶、榨油、人造棉等工厂，也正陆续投入生产。所有的工厂全部投入生产后，将有力地改变布依族人民的生产和生活面貌。
      “布依区是好地方，山高水又长；方圆几千里，到处有宝藏”。这是布依族人民赞美自己家乡美丽、富饶的颂歌。但在解放前，布依族人民的生产和生活很落后，一直到解放后，在共产党和人民政府领导下，布依族人民才迅速改变了农业上“刀耕火种，轮歇耕作”的生产方法。并从1951年开始，先后在惠水、罗甸、贞丰、镇宁等县办了一批地方工业厂矿，为当地人民发展生产和改善生活提供了重要条件。今春党中央提出工农业同时并举的方针后，布依族人民在各级地方党委和人民政府领导下，迅速掀起了空前高涨的发展工农业生产运动。
