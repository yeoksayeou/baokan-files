    新华社21日讯  塔斯社开罗19日讯：中东通讯社发表了这家通讯社的社长卡迈勒·希纳维发自巴格达的消息。希纳维说，伊拉克全国都非常平静。
    希纳维说：“每一个来到巴格达的人都不可能想像得到，这个首都就是革命中心。伊拉克首都的生活完全正常，没有任何限制”。
    希纳维又说，“人民热烈支持并爱戴革命政府。革命深入了千百万伊拉克人的心坎。它以闪电般的速度获得了胜利。”
    在谈到伊拉克国王费萨尔和王储伊拉在政变一开始就被打死这件事时，希纳维说：“革命政府逮捕了大批旧政界人士和前部长。特别军事法庭将对他们进行审讯。他们的罪行将在日内公布。没有被政府逮捕的另一些人向新政权投降了，以便争取人民的宽大处理。这些人包括前首相巴班、前内政大臣卡扎兹、前经济大臣帕查奇等人。”
