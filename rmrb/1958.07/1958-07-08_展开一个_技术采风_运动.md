    Launch a "Technology Folk Song Collection" Movement
    Lin Mo
    Not long ago, a folk song collection campaign was launched nationwide. In a short period of time, tens of thousands of new folk songs were collected. Since the Great Leap Forward, how many folk songs have workers and farmers across the country created? It’s truly like a vast ocean, impossible to count. In industrial and agricultural production, isn’t the variety and quantity of reforms, creations, and inventions being carried out by our country's working people in production technology also like an infinitely rich ocean? These things are even more urgently in need of collection by scientific and technical personnel. The "Technology Folk Song Collection" activity initiated and organized by the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association is worth promoting and popularizing on a large scale throughout the country.
    If popular science organizations in various parts of the country could collect, research, appraise, improve, and promote the inventions and creations of the masses, it would have a huge impact on our country's industrial and agricultural production. Members of the Popular Science Association of the Suining County Agricultural Experiment Station in Sichuan Province summarized and promoted the experience of "one pond and embankment for five uses" locally, which is expected to increase production by the equivalent of 24 million catties of grain. And there are countless similar experiences created by workers and farmers in various places! If our scientific workers can study the advanced experiences of producing 4,000 catties and 5,000 catties of wheat per mu in various places this year, summarize the scientific principles behind them, and enable them to be mastered by farmers across the country, there will definitely be an unprecedented and huge change in our country's wheat production. In terms of industrial production, there are also many such examples.
    Science comes from production practice, and more and more people today believe this truth, which is a good phenomenon. However, although the working people have accumulated rich experience in production, many of them have not had the opportunity to read and write in the past and lack the necessary theoretical foundation, so they cannot summarize the scientific principles behind it. This requires the help of scientific workers. The combination of the working people's practical experience in production and the theoretical knowledge of scientists will bring unlimited vitality to our country's technological revolution and scientific development. The mass "Technology Folk Song Collection" activity carried out by the Sichuan Popular Science Organization is a good way to combine scientists with the inventions and creations of workers and farmers. Scientists go deep into reality and systematically summarize the advanced production experiences and inventions and creations of the masses, raising them to the theoretical level. This greatly enriches the content of scientific research, improves the scientific knowledge of the masses, and in turn guides production practice, promotes technological revolution, and raises industrial and agricultural production to a higher level.
    This method of coming from practice and going back to practice, improving on the basis of popularization, and popularizing under the guidance of improvement, is the working method of scientists following the mass line. In today's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, this working method should be universally promoted, so that the flower of popular science can bloom all over the country!

    展开一个“技术采风”运动
    林沫
    不久之前，全国展开了一个搜集民间诗歌的采风活动。短时间内就采集了成千上万的新民歌。大跃进以来，全国的工人和农民创作了多少民歌？这真像汪洋大海，难以计量。在工农业生产中，当前我国劳动人民在生产技术上所进行的各种改革、创造和发明，其数量之多和方面之广，不是也像一个无限丰富的汪洋大海吗？这些东西，更迫切需要科学技术人员去采集。四川省科学技术普及协会所发起和组织的“技术采风”活动，值得在全国范围内大大提倡和推广。
    如果全国各地的科普组织都能把群众的创造发明，加以采集、研究、鉴定、提高和推广，对我国的工农业生产，将发生巨大的作用。四川遂宁县农业试验站的科普协会会员，在当地总结和推广了“塘堰五用”一项经验，预计就可增产相当二千四百万斤粮食的财富。而各地工人和农民创造的类似这样的经验，何只万千！如果我们的科学工作者能把今年各地小麦亩产四千斤、五千斤的先进经验，加以研究，总结出其中的科学道理，能够为全国农民所掌握，我国的小麦生产就一定会发生一个空前的巨变。在工业生产方面，这样的例子也是很多的。
    科学来自生产实践，今天已有越来越多的人信服了这条真理，这是一个好的现象。但是，劳动人民在生产中虽然积累了丰富的经验，由于他们许多人过去没有机会读书识字，缺乏必要的理论基础，还不能总结其中的科学道理，这就需要科学工作者加以帮助。劳动人民生产实践的经验，加上科学家的理论知识，二者很好地结合起来，将给我国的技术革命和科学发展带来无限的生命力。四川科普组织所开展的群众性的“技术采风”活动，就是科学家和工人农民发明创造相结合的好办法。科学家深入实际，把群众的先进生产经验和发明创造，进行系统的总结，提高到理论水平。这样就大大丰富了科学研究的内容，提高了群众的科学知识，反过来又指导了生产实践，促进技术革命，把工农业生产提到更高的水平。
    这种从实际中来，又到实际中去，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，就是科学家走群众路线的工作方法。在工农业生产大跃进的今天，这种工作方法应该普遍推广，让科学普及之花开遍全国！
