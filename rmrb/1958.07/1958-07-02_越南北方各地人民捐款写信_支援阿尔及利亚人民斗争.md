    支援阿尔及利亚人民斗争
    据新华社河内1日电　三个月来，越南北方各地人民为了支援阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，已经捐助了越南币一亿四千九百万元，并且举办了一千四百多个报告会，有四十多万人听了这些报告。越南各地人民还在集会上通过了一千三百多个支援阿尔及利亚人民斗争的决议书，并且写了五千多封信给阿尔及利亚人民，表示坚决支持他们的正义斗争。
    这是越南支援阿尔及利亚独立斗争委员会最近发表的公报宣布的。
    越南支援阿尔及利亚独立斗争委员会在6月30日举行会议，总结了从3月30日“声援阿尔及利亚日”以来的工作。越南支援阿尔及利亚独立斗争委员会主席阮春水在报告中说，越南人民支援阿尔及利亚运动的良好结果增强了兄弟般的越阿两国人民在反对殖民主义侵略者的斗争中的团结和友谊。这个运动也鼓舞了越南人民反对美帝国主义干涉南越的斗争意志。
