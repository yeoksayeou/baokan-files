Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th -- A "combination of indigenous and foreign methods" small coke oven, which is of great significance for promoting the great development of local coking industries, has recently been successfully trial-manufactured in Anshan. This type of coke oven requires little investment and yields quick results, and can be built in every township and commune. It can not only solve the coking equipment needs of the tens of thousands of medium and small blast furnaces being built across the country, but also recover a large amount of valuable chemical raw materials.

This small coke oven is a new contribution of the Anshan ferrous metallurgical design personnel to the greatly developing local iron and steel industry. The small coke oven that has just been successfully tested is a demonstration model, and the coke produced is of very good quality. The designers are now rushing to prepare 10,000 copies of blueprints for use by various regions to develop the coking industry.

The newly successfully tested small coke oven absorbs the advantages of both indigenous coke ovens and modern large coke ovens. It has the same advantages as indigenous coke ovens, namely low investment, simple equipment, and rapid construction. However, because it adopts the method of closed coking using its own generated gas like large coke ovens, the coke yield per hundred jin of coal is fifteen to twenty jin higher than that of indigenous coke ovens, and the sulfur content and ash content of the coke are lower, which is of great benefit to increasing pig iron production. At the same time, it can also recover a large number of by-products. Each such small coke oven can recover twelve tons of crude benzene and sixty-five tons of coal tar per year. Benzene is an important raw material for manufacturing pesticides, artificial fibers, and dyes, and coal tar can be refined into seventy or eighty kinds of products such as light and heavy diesel oil.

The coke produced by such a five-hole small coke oven with an annual output of 1,500 tons can meet the ironmaking needs of a small blast furnace with a volume of three cubic meters. The construction cost of such a coke oven is 3,000 yuan, which is slightly higher than that of an indigenous coke oven, but the income from by-products alone can offset it in less than three months. In addition, this type of coke oven can adopt raw materials and power sources according to local conditions. Its furnace body is made of ordinary building bricks and clay bricks, with very little steel used. If steel is lacking, it can also be replaced with bricks, ceramic pipes, waste iron drums, etc. In places without electricity, the blower of the small coke oven can be driven by manpower, animal power, hydropower, or wind power, and the water needed for the coke oven can be met by simply digging an ordinary earthen well. The construction technology of the coke oven is also relatively simple, and construction workers who can build civilian houses can build one in seven or eight days.

    集中土、洋焦炉的优点
    鞍山制成新型小焦炉
    这种炼焦炉的好处是：花钱少，收效快，出焦多，乡乡社社都能建，还能回收珍贵的化学原料。
    新华社鞍山4日电　对促进地方焦化工业大发展有重大意义的一种“土洋结合”的小型炼焦炉，最近在鞍山试造成功。这种炼焦炉投资少，收效快，每个乡、社都能建设。它不仅能够解决各地正在兴建的上万座中、小型高炉需要的炼焦设备问题，而且还能回收大量珍贵的化学原料。
    这种小焦炉，是鞍山黑色冶金设计人员对大发展中的地方钢铁工业的新贡献。刚试验成功的这座小焦炉是示范性的，炼出的焦炭质量很好。现在设计人员正在赶制一万份图纸，供给各地发展焦化工业用。
    新试验成功的小焦炉，吸收了土焦炉和现代化大焦炉的优点。它具有与土焦炉相同的投资少、装备简便、建设迅速的优点，但是由于它采用了大焦炉的利用自身发生的煤气密闭炼焦的方法，因而每百斤煤炼出的焦炭比土焦炉多十五到二十斤，焦炭的含硫量和灰分较低，这对增产生铁有很大的好处。同时，它还能回收大量的副产品，每一座这样的小焦炉一年能回收十二吨粗苯和六十五吨焦油。苯是制造农药、人造纤维、染料的重要原料，焦油可以提炼出轻、重柴油等七、八十种产品。
    一座这种年产一千五百吨的五孔小焦炉所出的焦炭，可以满足一个容积三立方公尺的小高炉炼铁需要。这样一座焦炉的建设资金是三千元，比土焦炉高一些，但是不到三个月，仅仅副产品的收入就能抵上。此外，这种焦炉还可以因地制宜地采用原材料和动力。它的炉身是用普通建筑用砖和粘土坯砌成的，钢材用的很少，如果钢材缺少，还能用砖、陶瓷管、废铁桶等来代替。在没有电的地方，小焦炉的鼓风机可以用人力、畜力、水力、风力来带动，焦炉用水只需开一个一般的土井就可以满足。焦炉的建筑技术也较简单，能盖民房的建筑工人用七、八天的时间就能建成一座。
