Excellent Breeds

    Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, a wool and meat breed, is the first fine-wool sheep breed cultivated in China with the help of Soviet experts.

    Xinjiang fine-wool sheep are strongly built and highly adaptable. Their production performance is good even under relatively extensive feeding conditions. Xinjiang sheep have a large wool yield, with rams yielding 7-8 kilograms, with a maximum of 18 kilograms; ewes yield 4-5 kilograms. The wool quality is fine and long.

    Xinjiang fine-wool sheep also have good meat production performance, with a meat yield of about 50%.

    Ewes have a high reproduction rate, producing 130 to 145 lambs per 100 ewes per year. Using Xinjiang fine-wool sheep rams for crossbreeding improves coarse-wool sheep very well. The wool yield of the first generation of crossbred sheep is generally 1 to 1.5 times higher than that of local sheep, and the wool quality is also significantly improved. (Attached picture)

    新疆细毛羊
    新疆毛肉兼用细毛羊，是我国在苏联专家帮助下育成的第一个细毛羊品种。
    新疆细毛羊体质结实，适应能力很强，在比较粗放的饲养条件下，生产性能表现良好。新疆羊的剪毛量很大，公羊为七—八公斤，最高的十八公斤；母羊四—五公斤。毛质细而长。
    新疆细毛羊产肉性能也很好，出肉率在50％左右。
    母羊繁殖率很高，每一百只母羊每年可产羔一百三十只到一百四十五只。利用新疆细毛羊种公羊杂交，改良粗毛羊的效果很好，第一代杂交种羊的产毛量，一般比当地羊提高一到一倍半，毛质也有显著改进。（附图片）
