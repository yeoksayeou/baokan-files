Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th - "Al-Ahram" published an editorial today stating that Eisenhower's reply to Khrushchev's proposal for a summit meeting on the Middle East situation "is obstructing the convening of the summit meeting" and is "placing obstacles on the road to peace."

	The newspaper condemned the US policy of procrastination, saying, "The United States realizes that its hands are already stained with blood in the invasion of Lebanon...realizes that its Sixth Fleet is the root cause of anxiety, fear, and unease in the region. Therefore, it does not dare to participate in the summit meeting."

	The newspaper refuted Eisenhower's suggestion to use the UN Charter to restrict non-Council members from participating in Security Council meetings. It pointed out that the United States' trick is to create obstacles to serve US policies.

	"Al Shaab" criticized Eisenhower's delaying tactics regarding the summit meeting, saying that this "may even be closing the door to peace." The newspaper said, "We say to Eisenhower on behalf of millions of peace-loving people who are tired of the Cold War and brinkmanship, this must never be allowed!" It said that Eisenhower is now mentioning the prestige and authority of the United Nations, but he disregarded the Security Council's resolutions and the UN Secretary-General's report when he decided to send US troops to Lebanon.

	Cairo Radio pointed out that Western countries are afraid of holding a summit meeting. However, "regardless of the outcome of international discussions, the United States and Britain must eventually leave Lebanon and Jordan."

    开罗报纸揭示美国复信的实质
    在和平道上布置路障
    据新华社开罗26日电　“金字塔报”今天发表社论说，艾森豪威尔给赫鲁晓夫就中东局势举行首脑会议的建议的答复，“是在阻挠首脑会议的召开”并且是“在和平的道路上设置障碍”。
    这家报纸谴责美国的拖延政策说，“美国意识到它的双手已经在侵略黎巴嫩的事件中沾满了血迹……意识到它的第六舰队是在这个地区引起忧虑、恐惧和不安的根源。因此它不敢去参加首脑会议。”
    这家报纸驳斥了艾森豪威尔建议引用联合国宪章对非理事国参加安理会的会议加以限制的做法。它指出，美国的伎俩就是要制造障碍来为美国的政策服务。
    “人民报”在抨击艾森豪威尔对举行首脑会议所采取的拖延策略说，这“甚至可能是对和平关起大门”。这家报纸说，“我们代表千百万对冷战和战争边缘政策已经感到厌倦的爱好和平的人们对艾森豪威尔说，决不容许这样做！”它说，艾森豪威尔现在提到联合国的威信和权威，可是他先前在决定派美国军队到黎巴嫩去的时候，对安理会的决定和联合国秘书长的报告却置之不顾。
    开罗电台指出，西方国家害怕举行首脑会议。但是，“不管国际讨论结果如何，美国和英国最后都必须离开黎巴嫩和约旦”。
