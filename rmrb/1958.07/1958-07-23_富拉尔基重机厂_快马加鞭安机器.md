Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 22nd. With the civil engineering work nearing completion ahead of schedule at the Qiqihar Heavy Machinery Plant, currently under construction, the most pressing task is now the installation work.

The advancement of civil engineering has created favorable conditions for accelerating the installation work and shortening the construction period.

Currently, the construction and installation units are concentrating manpower and resources, preparing to complete the installation tasks within the first half of next year. To accelerate the installation progress, workers and cadres from the plant's steel casting, forging, and pressing workshops have formed a labor army to devote themselves to the installation of equipment such as steelmaking electric furnaces. The construction site has also organized a joint command in the steel casting and iron casting workshops to implement cross-construction in order to ensure that the two workshops can produce molten steel and molten iron ahead of schedule.

With the advancement of civil engineering and installation, nine workshops, including tool and machine repair workshops, have already been put into production. The plant's employees are now preparing to strive for the early production of large rolling mills. (Attached picture)

    快马加鞭安机器
    据新华社富拉尔基22日电  兴建中的富拉尔基重型机器厂，土建工程快要提前完工了。目前施工最紧张的已经是安装工程。
    土建工程的提前，给安装工程快马加鞭、缩短工期创造了有利条件。
    现在建设单位和施工单位正集中人力、物力，准备在明年上半年内完成安装任务。为了加快安装进度，工厂的铸钢、锻压等车间的生产工人和干部，都组成了劳动大军投入炼钢电炉等设备的安装工作。工地还在铸钢、铸铁车间组织联合指挥部，实行交叉施工，以便保证两个车间能提前出钢水和出铁水。
    随着土建、安装工程的提前，这个厂已经有工具、机修等九个车间投入生产。现在厂里职工正在准备争取提前生产大型轧钢机。（附图片）
