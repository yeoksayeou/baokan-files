Content to Stay in the Middle Reaches Inevitably Leads to Downstream
    Shaodong County, Hunan Province, Combines Inspection Work with Criticism of the "Content to Stay in the Middle" Ideology, Further Encouraging Cadres to Exert Greater Efforts and Set Off a Higher Tide of Catching Up with the Advanced
    (People's Daily, Changsha) Reporter Huang Yubai reports: Shaodong County, Hunan Province, combined the inspection and summary of the previous stage of work with criticism of the "content to stay in the middle" ideology that existed among some cadres, further encouraging all cadres to exert greater efforts and set off a higher tide than before of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and everyone becoming advanced."
    Recently, Shaodong County convened a meeting of county and township cadres. At this meeting, the Shaodong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized all cadres to conscientiously study the Party's general line for building socialism, and in accordance with the spirit of the general line, used the method of rectification to mobilize all cadres to summarize and inspect the previous stage of work, affirming the great achievements made since the launch of the agricultural production Great Leap Forward movement. The vast majority of cadres attending the meeting were confident and determined to achieve this year's leap forward plan. However, many cadres still did not have enough enthusiasm, and even more generally harbored the idea of "content to stay in the middle." Some township and commune cadres whose work was relatively good thought that they had "done enough" and "leapt to the top" after carrying out a period of work. Some township and commune cadres whose work was in an intermediate state, starting from the status quo, believed that although their areas were "not as good as the best," they were still "better than the worst." A small number of township and commune cadres whose work was backward showed pessimism and lacked courage and confidence. They did not dare to say "strive for the upstream," but said that "even if we work ourselves to the bone, we can only strive for the middle reaches." All of this concentratedly manifested the lack of enthusiasm and the mentality of being content to stay in the middle among these cadres.
    As reflected in the meeting, these comrades who were content to stay in the middle also put forward many so-called theoretical bases. First, they mechanically emphasized that "the two ends are small and the middle is large, and the middle state is bound to be the majority. If everyone strives for the upstream, where will there be so many upstream?" Second, the "condition theory," saying that the soil quality in their areas is poor, the season is late, and the work foundation is not good. These are material, primary, and people's enthusiasm is secondary. If the conditions are not good, enthusiasm alone is empty. Third, they styled themselves as "pragmatists," saying that now "bragging" and talking well are empty. No matter what upstream or downstream you are, you can only see who is superior after the autumn harvest. Some said that after a large movement, there is often a "anti-rash advance," and perhaps there will be a anti-rash advance after this autumn, so everything can only follow others. Fourth, they complained that "the masses are backward," believing that they have enthusiasm, accept new things quickly, and want to strive for the upstream, but "the masses are backward," and there is no way.
    Based on these circumstances, the county party committee, on the basis of leading all cadres to study and discuss the general line, organized them to debate the following three questions. Namely: 1. Is it "almost done"? 2. Does the "condition theory" conform to the actual situation? How much of a role do people actually play in production? 3. What is the essence of "pessimism"? Through "three inspections" (inspecting drive and dedication, inspecting more, faster, better, and more economical, and inspecting the completion of tasks), and "three comparisons" (comparing the work foundation, comparing natural conditions, and comparing work achievements), from theory to practice, the various erroneous arguments were powerfully criticized. Cadres of Weijiaqiao Township, when comparing the work foundation, used facts to criticize the tendency of "seeing things but not people." Taitou Cooperative of the township was originally a first-class cooperative, and had a member of the township party committee stationed there, but due to lack of enthusiasm and complacency, it turned into a third-class cooperative. On the other hand, Pingjiang Cooperative was originally a third-class cooperative, but since this year, the cadres have been full of energy, catching up quickly, and have jumped to become a first-class cooperative. Cadres of Tangxiaqiao Township and Huochangping Township talked about how their township and Shashi Township are neighboring townships with the same natural conditions, but this year Shashi Township's rice transplanting was ten days earlier, and now the seedlings are growing very well. This is not because Shashi Township is blessed by nature, but because they have more enthusiasm. Zhumaqiao Township, through "three inspections" and accounting, found that due to factors such as things that could be done but were not done, things that should be done but were not done, and things that could be striven for but were done less, it is estimated that income will be reduced by more than 310,000 yuan, accounting for about 11% of the total planned income for the year. The cadres of this township suddenly realized that they had suffered a great loss from the idea of being content to stay in the middle.
    Through debate, everyone realized that the enthusiasm of people with socialist consciousness is the most basic and most active factor, and the "condition theory" is essentially an attempt to cover up right-leaning conservative ideas. Everyone also pointed out the danger of "being content to stay in the middle." The middle reaches, the downstream, and the upstream are not fixed and immutable, but are constantly changing and developing. Therefore, relaxing subjective efforts will inevitably lead to either not advancing or retreating, tending to the downstream.
    Through heated debates, everyone felt the importance of "discussing principles." They also realized that they should use dialectics to observe and analyze problems, and that they should be good at seeing the mainstream and essence of things. At this point, the "content to stay in the middle" theory has no place to stand. All cadres expressed that they would strive for the upstream, compare their drive and dedication, firmly grasp the current work, and continue to leap forward. During the meeting, many comrades from the townships called or sent people back at night to deploy work, seize the opportunity for inter-tillage and topdressing, and expand the area of summer crops. Longgongqiao Township sent a cadre back to launch the masses in a sudden attack, and in one day and one night, the township expanded the planting of more than 1,000 jin of early-maturing crops.

    甘居中游必然趋向下游
    湖南邵东县结合检查工作批判甘居中游思想  干部进一步鼓足干劲掀起更高的赶先进高潮
    本报长沙电　记者黄驭白报道：湖南省邵东县结合检查总结前段工作，批判部分干部中存在着的“甘居中游”的思想，使全体干部进一步鼓足了干劲，掀起了比以前更高的“学先进、赶先进、人人当先进”的浪潮。
    最近，邵东县召开了县、乡干部会。在这次会议上，中共邵东县委组织全体干部认真地学习了党的建设社会主义的总路线，并根据总路线的精神，用整风的方法，发动全体干部总结检查了前段工作，肯定了开展农业生产大跃进运动以来所获得的伟大成绩。到会的绝大部分干部对实现今年跃进计划是信心足、决心大的。但是也有不少干部干劲还不够足，甚至还较普遍地存在着“甘居中游”的思想。有些工作较好的乡社干部在进行一段工作以后，就认为“干的差不多了”，“跃进到顶了”。有的工作处在中间状态的乡社干部则从安于现状出发，认为自己地区虽然“比上不足”，但还是“比下有余”。少数工作后进的乡社干部则表现悲观，缺乏勇气和信心，他们不敢说“力争上游”，而是说“搞脱一层皮也不过是争个中游”。所有这些，集中表现了这些干部干劲不足，甘居中游的思想情绪。
    从会议上反映，这些甘居中游的同志还提出了许多所谓理论根据。他们一是机械地强调“两头小、中间大，中游状态必然是多数，如果人人力争上游，哪里有这么多上游”。二是“条件论”，说他们地区的土质差、季节迟、工作基础不好，这些是物质，是第一性的，人的干劲是第二性的，条件不好，光有干劲也是空的。三是自命为“务实主义”者，他们说现在“吹牛皮”，讲得再好是空的，管你什么上游下游，等秋后看货才能见高低。有的则说，一个大运动后，常常有个“反冒进”，说不定今年秋后要反冒进，因此，什么事都只能跟着别人来。四是埋怨“群众落后”，认为自己有干劲，接受新事物快，想争上游，就是“群众落后”，没办法。
    根据这些情况，县委在领导全体干部学习讨论总路线的基础上，组织他们辩论了以下三个问题。即：一、是不是“差不多了”？二、“条件论”是不是符合实际情况？人在生产中到底有多大作用？三、“悲观论”实质上是什么问题？通过“三查”（查干劲钻劲、查多快好省、查任务的完成），“三比”（比工作基础、比自然条件、比工作成绩），从理论到实际，有力地批判了各种错误论调。魏家桥乡的干部在比工作基础时，用事实批判了“见物不见人”的倾向。该乡台头社原为一类社，并且有乡党委委员驻社，但是由于干劲不足，安于现状，结果变为三类社；而平江社原来是个三类社，但是今年以来干部劲头十足，急起直追，已经一跃而为一类社了。棠下桥乡、火厂坪乡的干部谈到本乡同砂石乡是交界邻乡，自然条件一样，但今年砂石乡的插秧就早十来天，现在禾苗长得很好，这并不是砂石乡得天独厚，而是因为他们干劲更大。驻马桥乡通过“三查”算账，发现由于可以办而未办、该做到的而未做到、可以争取多做而少做了等因素，估计大约要减少收入三十一万余元，约占全年计划总收入的11％。这个乡的干部才恍然大悟，说吃了甘居中游思想的大亏。
    通过辩论，大家认识到有了社会主义觉悟的人的积极性是最基本、最活跃的因素，“条件论”实质上是企图掩饰右倾保守思想。大家还指出“甘居中游”思想的危险性，中游、下游和上游不是固定不变，而是经常变化发展的，因此放松主观努力，结果必然是不进则退，趋向下游。
    通过热烈的辩论，大家感到了“务虚”的重要意义。也认识到要运用辩证法来观察分析问题，要善于看到事物的主流和本质。至此，“甘居中游”论已无容身之地，全体干部表示要力争上游，比干劲比钻劲，狠狠抓紧当前工作，再接再厉大跃进。会议期间，很多乡的同志打电话或者晚上派人赶回去布置工作，抓紧中耕追肥，扩大夏种作物面积。龙公桥乡派回去一个干部突击发动群众，一天一晚全乡扩种了一千多斤种子的早熟作物。
