    The Man Who Makes Foreign Things
    --The Story of Zhang Jixiang Making Foreign Machine Parts
    Jia Zhiyuan

    Zhang Jixiang is a machine repairman at the Zhangshan Mining Area of the Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, Sichuan Province. He is 48 years old this year. Born into a poor worker's family, he suffered oppression and exploitation by capitalists like many other veteran workers before liberation, working as a handyman for nine years and learning forging and fitting. He came to work at the mine in April last year.

    The forging drills and air compressors in this mine are all made in the United States, but there are no spare parts. As soon as Zhang Jixiang arrived, some comrades said to him: "These are foreign machines, and the parts are bought from other places..." Sometimes, due to lack of stock or incorrect specifications, the machines had to be shut down and idled. After discovering this problem, Zhang Jixiang immediately asked the leadership to solve the parts problem. In fact, the factory had already spent more than 13,500 yuan to send people to Chengdu, Chongqing, Shanghai and other places to buy them, but they would not be delivered until a year later. Zhang Jixiang thought, "What's the use of getting the things a year later! Can we find a way to make them ourselves?" This made him think deeply. After actively soliciting the opinions of several comrades, he felt that he could do it. Zhang Jixiang suggested that the engineer design the drawings of the parts and he would process and make them himself. But the answer he got was: "These are American-made machines, we don't have the conditions, the technical level is not good..., we 'can't mess around'."

    The "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets" machine operation situation made Zhang Jixiang unable to restrain his inner annoyance. He said: "If we drive today and stop tomorrow, what kind of production is this!" Thinking of how the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield were able to defeat the American "ace" troops, and they even picked up discarded artillery shells to make gun parts, could it be that we can't make these American-made machines? "No! We must be able to make them." He told the Party Branch Secretary his request to make spare parts himself. The Branch Secretary supported his opinion and encouraged him, saying: "You go ahead boldly, if the engineer doesn't agree, the branch agrees, we can't wait idly!" Zhang Jixiang was very happy to hear the Branch Secretary's words, "Right! Anyway, we can't wait idly!".

    After the news that Zhang Jixiang was making parts himself spread, some workers sarcastically said: "Without drawings, tools, and instruments, he can make these 'foreign things'! He's really blowing hot air!"

    It is difficult to make precise machine parts without tools and instruments. Zhang Jixiang knew this, but he was not discouraged. He said: "Roads are always made by people, and machines are always made by people. With the support of the Party, as long as you study hard and humbly discuss with your comrades, we will definitely be able to succeed in this unprecedented thing."

    With determination, where to start? During the day, Zhang Jixiang sat next to the machine, carefully observing the appearance of each part and its function during operation; at night, he lay in bed pondering. He came up with a simple way to make drawings, which was to first draw rough sketches on white paper with red and blue pens, and if it was not accurate, he would erase and redraw. After seven days and seven nights of hard work, he finally drew the drawings. At the beginning of the trial production, he encountered the difficulty of not having high-carbon steel. At this time, Zhang Jixiang felt that there were too many problems. What should he do? If he gave up, he would be a quitter.

    Several nights passed, and Zhang Jixiang stayed up all night. Sometimes, he thought of the Branch Secretary's words: "We can't wait idly!" When he saw the scene of more than 300 workers often unable to go down the well to produce, he asked himself again: "Can a Communist Party member bow his head to difficulties? This is absolutely impossible." He decided to discuss it with his comrades again. Workers Xu Yulin, Ma Yousheng, Gao Lianchang and others suggested that he use low-carbon steel and heat it into high-carbon steel, and they quickly helped him realize this plan. After more than a month of hard work, more than 30 kinds of parts such as the wind hammer, drill bit, slot plate of the forging drill, and the connecting rod of the air compressor were all made. From then on, the two machines were brand new. Many workers admired and said: "Zhang Jixiang is really capable, now American goods have become Chinese goods." A worker also wrote a poem:
        There is a Zhang Jixiang in the mine,
          He has his own ideas about renovating machines,
            After a month of hard work, he broke superstitions,
              A withered tree blooms with fragrance for thousands of miles.

    Now, Comrade Zhang Jixiang is realizing the leap forward plan he proposed to the conference at the First Sichuan Provincial Congress of Advanced Producers, to repair eleven American-style wind drills before July this year. In mid-May, when all the employees of the factory enthusiastically discussed how to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, Zhang Jixiang also guaranteed that he would make a complete set of parts for twenty-four American-style wind drills within this year.

    制造洋东西的人
    ——张吉祥制作外国机器配件的故事
    贾志远
    张吉祥，是四川省国营乐山磷肥厂张山采矿场的机修工，今年四十八岁。他出身在一个贫苦的工人家庭，解放前，他和许多老工人一样，受尽了资本家的压迫和剥削，当过九年杂工，学过锻工、钳工。去年4月份，他来到矿场工作。
    这个矿场的锻钎机和压风机，都是美国制造的，但一样配件也没有。张吉祥刚一来，有的同志就对他说：“这是洋机器，配件是在外地买。……”有时因缺货或规格不合，机器只好停下来闲着。张吉祥发现这个问题后，便立即请求领导上解决配件问题。其实，厂里早已花了一万三千五百多元，派专人到成都、重庆、上海等地去买过了，但要一年后才能交货。张吉祥心想：“一年后东西拿来作何用呵！能不能设法自己做呢？”这便引起了他深思。他主动征求了几个同志的意见后，觉得自己可以做。张吉祥便建议工程师把配件图纸设计出来，自己加工自己做。但得到的回答是：“这是美国造的机器，我们没有条件，技术水平不行……，‘不能随便乱搞’。”
    “三天打鱼，两天晒网”的机器运转情况，使张吉祥再也抑止不住内心的烦恼。他说：“今天开车，明天停车，这叫搞什么生产哟！”又想起在朝鲜战场上，中国人民志愿军能够把美国“王牌”队伍都打得落花流水，他们还把废炮弹壳拣来做成枪炮零件，难道这些美国造的机器，我们就造不出来吗？“不！一定能造出来。”他把自做配件的要求向党支部书记谈了出来。支部书记支持了他的意见，并鼓励他说：“你大胆地干，工程师不同意，支部同意，我们不能闲着手等待！”张吉祥听了支部书记的话，心里非常高兴，“对！反正我们不能闲着手等待！”。
    当张吉祥自做配件的消息传出后，有的工人讥讽地说：“没有图纸、工具、仪器，他都能把这‘洋东西’做出来呀！他不吹‘空牛’才怪哩！”
    没有工具、仪器，要做出精确的机器配件来，那是困难的。张吉祥也知道这一点，但他不灰心。他说：“道路总是人走出来的，机器总是人造出来的。有党的支持，只要自己苦心钻研，虚心和同志们一道商量，这从未做过的事么，就一定能做成功。”
    有了决心，又从何作起呢？白天，张吉祥就坐在机器旁边，仔细观察每个零件的模样和运转时的作用；晚上，就躺在床上揣想。他想出了一个制图纸的土办法，就是先用红蓝笔在白纸上画草图，不准，擦掉又来。这样苦战了七天七夜，终于把图样画出来了。一开始试制，又碰上没有高炭钢的困难。这时，张吉祥感到问题太多了，这怎么办呢？放弃了吧！成了半途而废。
    几个晚上过去了，张吉祥通夜未眠。有时，他又想起支部书记的话：“我们不能闲着手等待！”当他看到三百多个工人经常不能下井生产的情景，他又反问自己：“一个共产党员，能向困难低头吗？这绝对不可能。”他决定再找同志们商量。工人徐玉林、马有生、高连昌等人，建议他用低炭钢加温炼成高炭钢，又帮助他很快实现了这个计划。经过一个多月的苦战，锻钎机的风锤、钎头、槽板，压风机的连杆等三十多种配件，全都做出来了。从此，两部机器焕然一新。许多工人都钦佩地说：“张吉祥当真能干，如今美国货变成了中国货。”一个工人还题了一首诗：
        矿山有个张吉祥，
          革新机器有主张，
            苦战一月破迷信，
              枯树开花万里香。
    现在，张吉祥同志正在实现他在四川省第一届先进生产者代表会议上向大会提出的跃进计划，今年7月份以前，修好十一部美式风钻机。5月中旬，全厂职工热烈讨论十五年如何赶上英国时，张吉祥又保证要在今年内，做好二十四部美式风钻机的全套配件。
