    Reflected the Will of the Broad Masses of People
    I finished reading the People's Daily of the 17th with excitement. This day's newspaper reported on many important events at home and abroad, especially with extensive coverage of news about the Middle East situation, including dispatches from London, cartoons, maps, and photographs. The editorial put forward a resounding call: "People of the World, Act to Stop American Aggression!" The birth of the Republic of Iraq has increased the world's peace forces, and the victory of the people of the Middle East is our victory. We must stop the imperialist armed intervention in the Middle East! Thank you for reporting the situation in the Middle East in detail and reflecting the will of the broad masses of people in a timely manner.

    Regarding the Population of Iraq and Jordan
    Some readers have called or written to ask about the correct figures for the populations of Iraq and Jordan. The international knowledge piece "Iraq" published in this newspaper on July 15th mentioned that the population of Iraq was approximately 6,530,000, which was the statistical figure from Iraq itself in 1957. The international knowledge piece "Jordan" published on July 18th mentioned that the population of Jordan was approximately 1,400,000, which was based on statistical figures published by Jordanian newspapers in May 1956, and the same as the population figure for Jordan published in the "World Knowledge Handbook" in 1957.

    A Vivid and Realistic Report
    The report by Cui Xiyan, the head of Yingju Agricultural Cooperative, serialized in the People's Daily on July 7th and 8th, "We Have Completely Eradicated the Root of Poverty," is a very good Marxist-Leninist report. Although the article is long, the more I read it, the more moved I became, and the more reluctant I was to put it down.
    The leading cadres and members of Yingju Cooperative, in order to shake off the label of disaster area and become a surplus grain cooperative, in order to "transform northern Henan into Jiangnan," and with their revolutionary spirit of "preferring hard work to bitter suffering," how could they not move people's hearts and inspire people to strive!
    This report also raises many thought-provoking questions. For example, how leading cadres should rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and follow the mass line. I have learned a lot from reading it.
    I suggest that the editorial department publish more such vivid and realistic reports in the future.

    A Very Persuasive Newsletter
    The "Record of the 'Conservatives' Conceding Defeat" published in the People's Daily on July 11th is a very persuasive newsletter. The author uses vivid facts to illustrate that the old and the new are constantly fighting, and the old will inevitably be replaced by the new. At the same time, it makes us clearly see that at a time when all fronts are making great leaps forward, there are also a few people who, due to the constraints of old habits and old ideas, do not dare to think or dare to act, and even do not quite believe in the miracles that others have created. After the news of high wheat yields in Hubei and Henan was published in the newspaper, some people expressed doubts about it. I advise these comrades to read this article carefully, as it will be beneficial to their own liberation of thought and broadening of their horizons.

      Already Not News
    The People's Daily published a Xinhua News Agency report on July 14th: "Airmail Postage Reduced." This news is no longer news, but old news. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications began implementing the reduction of airmail postage from July 1st. This news should have been reported before July 1st so that the people of the whole country would know. However, it was only published in the newspaper half a month later, which is too late.

    反映了广大人民的意志 我怀着激动的心情读完了17日的人民日报。这天的报纸报道了国内外许多重要的事情，特别是，用大量的篇幅发表了有关中东局势的许多消息，还有伦敦通讯、漫画、地图、照片。社论提出了响亮的号召：“全世界人民行动起来制止美国侵略”！伊拉克共和国的诞生增加了世界和平力量，中东人民的胜利就是我们的胜利，我们一定要制止帝国主义对中东的武装干涉！感谢你们及时把中东的形势详细报道出来，并且反映出广大人民的意志。

    有些读者打电话或写信来问伊拉克和约旦人口的正确数字。本报7月15日所登载的国际知识“伊拉克”中谈到，伊拉克人口约六百五十三万多，这是1957年伊拉克本国的统计数字。7月18日登载的国际知识“约旦”中谈到，约旦人口约一百四十万，这是根据1956年5月约旦本国报纸发表的统计数字，与1957年的“世界知识手册”中登载的约旦的人口数字相同。

    有血有肉的报告
  人民日报7月7日、8日连载的应举农业社社长崔希彦的报告
  “我们彻底挖掉了穷根”，是一篇很好的马克思列宁主义的报告。文章虽长，但我越读越感动，越读越不愿释手。
    应举社的领导干部和社员们为了摘掉灾区帽子，变为余粮社，为了“变豫北为江南”，“宁愿苦战、不愿苦熬”，这种穷干、实干的革命精神，怎不感人肺腑、叫人奋发呢！
    这篇报告也提出了很多发人深思的问题。比如，领导干部如何依靠群众，发动群众，走群众路线。读后从中得到不少教益。
    建议编辑部今后能够多登这样有血有肉具体生动的报告。

  一篇很有说服力的通讯
    7月11日人民日报发表的“‘保守派’服输记”，是一篇很有说服力的通讯。笔者以活生生的事实说明，新旧事物是在不断地斗争着，旧事物必然为新事物所代替。同时，使我们清楚地看到，在今天各个战线都在大跃进的时候，也有少数人由于旧习惯、旧思想的束缚，不敢想、不敢干，甚至对别人干出来的奇迹还不大相信。报上登出湖北、河南小麦高产的消息后，有些人就对此表示怀疑。奉劝这些同志仔细读读这篇文章，这对自己解放思想、开阔眼界是有好处的。

      已经不是新闻
    人民日报7月14日发表了新华社的报道：“航空邮资降价”。这消息已经不是新闻而是旧闻了。邮电部已从7月1日开始实行航空邮资降价，在7月1日以前本应将这一消息报道出去，让全国人民都知道。但是，时间隔了半月，这消息才在报上公布，未免太迟。
