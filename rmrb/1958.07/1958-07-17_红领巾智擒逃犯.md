    Young Pioneer Bravely Captures Fugitive

    After breakfast, Yao Shuanshan's mother went to repair the road, leaving him alone sitting at the door, humming incessantly, "Socialism is good, socialism is good, the socialist country is protected by the people..." One hand kept tapping on his leg. He was waiting for his classmates from the same village to go to school together.

    Suddenly, he felt someone gently pat him on the back. Thinking it was a classmate, he was about to get up when he turned around and saw a stranger. The man asked him with a smile that wasn't quite a smile, "Little brother, are you Yao Shuanshan?" "Yes, what is it?" The man cautiously glanced around, then took his hand and whispered, "Let's talk outside the village." "Strange, I've never met this person before, and his accent doesn't sound local. How does he know my name? And he wants to talk to me? And wants to talk outside the village?..." Yao Shuanshan's little brain was immediately filled with a series of questions. He also remembered what the teacher had told the students: that everyone should be a little vanguard in public security work! And he was a Young Pioneer, how could he not investigate a suspicious stranger? Thinking of this, he steeled his heart and made up his mind.

    Shuanshan followed the man to a remote place outside the village and pretended to be happy, saying, "You can speak freely, whatever it is." The man said, "I am a good friend of your brother. He has now escaped from prison and asked me to bring you a message, and also some clothes..." At this time, Shuanshan understood, but he couldn't think of a proper solution for the moment.

    It turned out that the man was named Gao Zhifa, from Shandong. Because he sabotaged the policy of unified purchase and sales, he was arrested by our government and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. During his custody, he remained unruly and conspired with Yao Ruihua (Yao Shuanshan's brother), a criminal in the same prison who had stolen property from the commune, to secretly escape from prison.

    Just as Shuanshan was wondering what to do, the man spoke again: "I'm terribly thirsty and hungry, please take me to your house to eat and drink something." This immediately struck Shuanshan's mind, and he said: "My mother is not at home, the key is with her (actually the key was on Shuanshan). I'll go get the key, you wait here, it's safer, in case others find out." Shuanshan got away and ran straight to the commune office, reporting the true situation to the work team and commune cadres. At this time, the commune stopped the meeting that was being held and organized militiamen to arrest the two fugitives under the guidance of Shuanshan.

    Yao Shuanshan is from Hongshui Township, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, a third-grade elementary school student, thirteen years old, and a Young Pioneer. He was praised by the masses for his meritorious capture of the fugitives. The County People's Committee also held an on-site meeting in the area and gave him material rewards.

    红领巾智擒逃犯
    早饭后，姚拴拴的母亲修路去了，他独个坐在门口，嘴里不停地哼着：“社会主义好，社会主义好，社会主义江山人民保……。”一只手还不断地在腿上打着拍子。他，在等着同村的同学一块到学校去上课。
    忽然，他觉得有人在背上轻轻地拍了一下，他以为是同学来了，正欲起身，回头一看，却是一个素不相识的人。那人带笑非笑地问了他一句：“小弟弟，你叫姚拴拴吗？”“是，有什么事？”那人小心翼翼地向周围瞟了一眼，便拉着他的手，低声说：“去村外谈谈吧。”“怪，这个人，我从未见过面，听起来口语又不是当地人，他怎么知道我的名字？还要和我谈谈？又要到村外谈？……”姚拴拴的小脑子里，顿时塞满了一系列的问题，他又想起老师对同学们讲的话：要大家在治安工作方面当一个小尖兵！自己又是一个少先队员，怎能对一个怀疑的生人，不加追究？想到这里，他心一狠，便拿定了主意。
    拴拴跟那人走到村外一个偏僻的地方，便故作高兴的样子，说道：“有啥事放心讲吧。”那人说：“我是你哥哥的好朋友，他现在从监里逃出，托我给你报信，还要几件衣物……。”这时拴拴明白了，但一时却想不出妥当的办法。
    原来，那人名叫高智发，山东人。由于他破坏统购统销政策，被我政府逮捕判处徒刑三年。在守法期间，仍不规矩，谋合同监的偷盗社内财物犯罪分子姚瑞华（姚拴拴的哥哥）暗中越狱逃跑。
    拴拴正在纳闷时，那人又开了腔：“我渴急了，也饥了，请带我到你家吃喝一些。这一下，正好击中了拴拴的心灵，他说：我母亲没在，钥匙在她身上带着，（其实钥匙在拴拴的身上）我去要钥匙，你在这里等着保险些，以防别人发现。拴拴脱了身，一直跑到社办公室，将真情实况报告给工作组和社干部。这时社里停止了正在召开的会议，便分头组织民兵，在拴拴的引导下，逮捕两个逃犯。
    姚拴拴是陕西省三原县洪水乡人，小学三年级学生，十三岁，少先队员。因为捉拿逃犯有功，受到了群众的赞扬。县人民委员会还在当地召开了现场会，给予了物质奖励。　（张来琛）（附图片）
