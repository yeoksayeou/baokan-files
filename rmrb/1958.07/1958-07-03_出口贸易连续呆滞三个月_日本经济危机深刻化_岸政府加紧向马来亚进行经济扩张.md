    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to Kyodo News Agency reports: Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan recently estimated that Japan's export amount for June will be 190 million US dollars. This means that since April, Japan's 1958 fiscal year exports have failed to break the 200 million US dollar mark for three consecutive months.
    Japan's economic crisis has entered a persistent phase. The Nobusuke Kishi government and Japanese monopoly capital groups are desperately trying to expand exports in an effort to escape the economic crisis. However, Japanese public opinion unanimously believes that Japan's export amount for this fiscal year will not only fail to reach the original target of 3.15 billion US dollars, but it will also be difficult to maintain the export level of 2.86 billion US dollars of the previous fiscal year. Currently, the Japanese government has been forced to consider revising the export target.
    This economic crisis in Japan began with a foreign exchange crisis. In the 1957 fiscal year, Japan's international balance of payments showed a deficit of more than 600 million US dollars. Therefore, while expanding exports, the Nobusuke Kishi government is trying its best to "balance" the international balance of payments. Japanese officials estimate that by the end of June, the amount of foreign exchange reserves will reach more than 720 million US dollars. However, this meager amount of foreign exchange reserves is not due to increased exports, but due to the forced reduction of imports. Import restrictions began after the Nobusuke Kishi government began implementing austerity policies in May of last year. The import amount in the first five months of this year alone was reduced by 629 million US dollars compared to the same period last year (the total import amount from January to May this year was 1.168 billion US dollars). During this period of restricting the import of raw materials, various enterprise departments mainly relied on inventory raw materials to maintain production. Currently, raw material inventories have been rapidly reduced, and the recent equipment updates have created a large demand for raw materials, which is difficult to meet with the current few hundred million US dollars of foreign exchange.
    Japan's economic foundation stipulates that to expand exports, it is necessary to increase raw material imports. According to statistics in a white paper recently published by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to increase exports by 100 yen, it is necessary to increase imports by 45 yen. With the increase in domestic raw material demand and the bleak prospects for overseas exports, a new foreign exchange crisis that will further deepen the Japanese economic crisis is about to follow.
    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Kuala Lumpur News: The Nobusuke Kishi government is actively expanding its economy into Malaya under the guise of "economic cooperation." Yu Hirai, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to the Federation of Malaya, recently told newspaper reporters that Japan is extremely concerned about the emerging industry bill recently proposed in the Legislative Assembly of Malaya, and Japan is "extremely interested" in investment in Malaya's iron ore, fisheries, rural industries, and rubber industries.
    Hirai revealed that after the Malayan emerging industry bill is passed, Japan will send an investigation team to Malaya for on-site investigation as the advance force for Japanese investment in Malaya.
    Hirai also bluntly said that the Nobusuke Kishi government is prepared to "assist" Malaya in establishing atomic factories and arsenals, and will introduce Japanese-style firearms and bullets to Malaya.
    The Japanese Southeast Asian Enterprise Technology Cooperation Industry and Commerce Investigation Group, dispatched by Japanese monopoly capital groups, arrived in Singapore on June 26 and is preparing to continue to the Federation of Malaya to investigate the possibility of jointly run industries with the capital of the two countries.

### 出口贸易连续呆滞三个月  日本经济危机深刻化  岸政府加紧向马来亚进行经济扩张

    出口贸易连续呆滞三个月
    日本经济危机深刻化
    岸政府加紧向马来亚进行经济扩张
    新华社1日讯　据共同社报道：日本大藏省和日本银行最近估计，6月份的日本出口数额将为一亿九千万美元。这就是说，从4月以来，日本1958年度输出已经一连三个月未能打开二亿美元的关口。
    日本的经济危机已经出现持久性的局面。岸信介政府和日本垄断资本集团正在拼命设法扩大输出，以期解脱经济危机。但是，日本的舆论一致认为，今年度的日本出口数额不仅达不到原订的三十一亿五千万美元的目标，就是想要维持在去年度的二十八亿六千万美元的输出水平也很困难。目前，日本政府已经不得不考虑重新修改输出数额的目标。
    日本这次经济危机是从外汇危机开始的。1957年度的日本国际收支出现了六亿多美元的赤字。因此，岸信介政府在扩大输出的同时，竭力设法使国际收支“平衡”。日本官方估计，到6月底，外汇储备数额将达七亿二千多万美元。但是，这笔少得可怜的外汇储备并不是由于扩大输出，而是由于强制缩小进口取得的。从去年5月岸信介政府开始实施紧缩政策以后就开始限制进口，只是今年头五个月的进口数额就比去年同一时期压缩了六亿二千九百万美元（今年1至5月的进口数额共计十一亿六千八百万美元）。在限制进口原料的这段期间，各企业部门主要是依靠库存原料来维持生产。目前，原料库存已经迅速减少，近年来的更新设备又在提出大批的原料需求，这种需求是不易用目前的几亿美元外汇来满足的。
    日本的经济基础规定，要扩大输出必须增加原料进口。据不久前日本通商产业省发表的白皮书统计，为了增加一百日元输出，需要增加四十五日元的输入。在国内原料需求增加和海外输出前途暗淡的情况下，使日本经济危机更加深刻化的新的外汇危机将要跟踪而至。
    据新华社2日讯　吉隆坡消息：岸信介政府正在“经济合作”的招牌下积极向马来亚进行经济扩张。日本驻马来亚联合邦代办平井勇最近对报纸记者说，日本对马来亚最近在立法议会提出的新兴工业法案极为关注，日本对马来亚的铁矿、渔业、农村工业和胶品工业等方面的投资“极感兴趣”。
    平井透露，在马来亚新兴工业法案通过后，日本将派遣考察团来马来亚进行现地调查，作为日本向马来亚投资的先头部队。
    平井还露骨地说，岸信介政府准备“协助”马来亚建立原子工厂和兵工厂，并且将日本式的枪械和子弹介绍给马来亚。
    由日本垄断资本集团派出的日本东南亚企业技术合作工商业考察团已经在6月26日到达新加坡，并且准备继续前往马来亚联合邦进行活动，以便调查用两国资本合办工业的可能性。
