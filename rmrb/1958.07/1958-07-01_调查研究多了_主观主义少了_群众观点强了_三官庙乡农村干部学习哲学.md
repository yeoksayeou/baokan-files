    More Investigation and Research, Less Subjectivism, Stronger Mass Perspective:
    Rural Cadres of Sanguanmiao Township Study Philosophy
    (Reported by our reporter Chen Jian) Rural cadres in Sanguanmiao Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, boldly opened the mysterious door of philosophy and achieved remarkable results by studying philosophy by combining theory with practice.
    Of the thirty-seven cadres in Sanguanmiao Township, 95% are students who have only recently become literate or are primary school graduates. After planting experimental fields, they generally paid attention to studying agricultural techniques, but always felt that they could not solve the fundamental problems. Therefore, they considered whether they could add a course on Marxism-Leninism theory to an experimental field. In February of this year, the Party Committee of this township held meetings for four nights in a row and seriously discussed this issue. Finally, they made a bold decision: to study philosophy. At that time, they only vaguely knew that philosophy was an important component of Marxism-Leninism, which could help transform thinking and solve practical work problems, but they did not know much about the specific content. At this time, a cadre named Gao Changhai was transferred from the district to this township to serve as the Party Secretary. He had studied philosophy for seventeen days at the Prefectural Party School and was willing to be a philosophy teacher. Another county cadre stationed in the commune named Zhen Binghao was also willing to teach while learning. Each student also paid five cents as a fee for lamp oil and chalk. The philosophy class for cadres in Sanguanmiao Township started in March.
    The teachers and students of this township jointly created teaching and learning methods that are unprecedented in the history of philosophy education at home and abroad. They were not bound by some philosophy textbooks and pamphlets. Combining the actual thinking of the students, the actual work, and the historical situation of the township, they boldly compiled "Philosophy Lectures." When the teachers talked about the subjective and objective, spirit and matter, and primary and secondary, they put a stone on the desk to explain. They explained epistemology of philosophy at the construction site of the reservoir. The teacher said: "This water is nature, is objective. In the past, we were afraid of water when there was flooding and loved water when there was drought, but we had no way to control it or utilize it. The Party leads us to build reservoirs to store water when it comes and release it when needed. When the subjective understands the objective laws of development, it can make nature benefit the masses." Student Fan Fugui used the example of growing crops to illustrate his understanding of the relationship between the universality and particularity of contradictions. He said: "The universality of contradiction is that all crops must go through five stages to achieve a bumper harvest: intensive cultivation, good varieties, sufficient fertilizer, timely watering, and technical management. The particularity of contradiction is that different crops have different requirements: sweet potatoes require shallow planting for a good harvest, corn requires early sowing, cotton requires pest control, and wheat requires careful management." The teachers and students here all said: "Although studying philosophy is difficult, it can be profound and shallow. As long as it is combined with practice and production, it can be learned well and mastered."
    The three months of philosophy study has given the cadres of Sanguanmiao Township a new look. They have begun to apply the philosophical principles they have learned to their actual work, and to raise the practical work they have already done to the level of theoretical principles. This township used to be a third-class township, and many township cadres had a relatively serious style of commandism. Fan Yunlai, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee, said: "At that time, we didn't know about investigation and research, we didn't understand the objective situation and objective laws, and the subjective decided everything. If the subjective and objective had contradictions and could not be unified, how could we not make mistakes!" Now, when the Party's various policies and instructions are passed down to the township, the township cadres first study the thinking of cadres, Party and League members, activists, the masses, and backward masses, and estimate the favorable and unfavorable conditions in the work. Then, they convene a general mobilization meeting, and then convene separate small meetings to carry out mobilization and deployment according to the specific situation. This method has been very effective, not only solving the problems of the township cadres' rough, simple, and generalized work style, but also solving many specific problems more smoothly. The township cadres here talk a lot about philosophy, raising the shortcomings in their daily work to the philosophical level for criticism. For example, if there are too many loans and the budget does not conform to the actual situation, and the masses have opinions about them, they are accused of being "subjective" and failing to grasp the "objective laws." When the deputy secretary of the Party Committee led the work of reservoir surveying, he proposed that the site could only be determined through detailed investigation and research. Recently, forty-five reservoirs that have been determined and started construction after surveying and design are very accurate. Last year, 40% of the reservoir sites were abandoned because no detailed investigation and research were conducted. Now, because the township cadres have the right way of thinking and the work style has been greatly improved, everyone generally feels that there are more ways to work than in the past. The masses said: "After the township cadres studied philosophy, three major new atmospheres have emerged: there is more investigation and research; there is less subjectivism and commandism; and the concept of relying on the masses has been strengthened."
    Under the influence of the cadres studying philosophy, the masses of this township have greatly broken superstition. Fan Suixiu, the famous eighty-year-old "old incense master" in the township, because his grandson Fan Daku studied philosophy and promoted atheistic philosophical views to him, took the lead in sending one thousand two hundred and thirty clay Bodhisattvas to the wheat fields as fertilizer in April this year. The masses in Mogou Village in this township have begun to level graves, and the leveled land has been planted with crops. The Red and Expert University in this township has opened a philosophy course, and two hundred and twenty-four people have participated in the study.
    Now, the philosophy teachers and students in Sanguanmiao Township need a philosophy textbook suitable for their teaching and learning. They initially chose "Common Knowledge of Philosophy" compiled by the Learning Magazine, but the learning effect was very poor. The students could not understand it after listening for several hours, so the teachers compiled their own "Philosophy Lectures." It can be imagined how important this issue will be in the near future when the vast grassroots cadres and hundreds of millions of peasants in the countryside demand to study philosophy. The time has come for philosophers and relevant departments to seriously consider and solve this problem.

### 调查研究多了　主观主义少了　群众观点强了  三官庙乡农村干部学习哲学

    调查研究多了　主观主义少了　群众观点强了
    三官庙乡农村干部学习哲学
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南省登封县三官庙乡的农村干部大胆地敞开了哲学的神秘大门，用理论联系实际的办法学习哲学，收到了显著的成绩。
    三官庙乡的三十七名干部有95％是脱盲不久的学员和初小毕业生，他们在种了实验田以后，普遍注意钻研农业技术，但总觉得不能解决红的问题，因此他们考虑能不能在一块实验田上再加一堂马列主义的理论课程。今年2月间，这个乡的中共党委会连续开了四个夜晚的会议，认真讨论了这个问题，最后作了大胆的决定：学哲学。当时他们只蒙胧地知道哲学是马克思列宁主义的重要组成部分，能帮助改造思想，解决实际工作问题，但具体内容还不大了解。这时区里有一位叫高长海的干部调到这个乡任党委书记，他在地委初级党校学过十七天哲学，愿意当哲学教员，还有一位叫甄禀豪的县驻社干部，也愿意一面学一面教，每个学员又交了五分钱，作为灯油和粉笔费。三官庙乡的干部哲学课就在3月开课了。
    这个乡的教员和学员共同创办了中外哲学教育史上都没有的教学方法和学习方法，他们没有被一些哲学课本和小册子所束缚，他们结合学员的思想实际、工作实际和本乡的历史情况，大胆地编写了“哲学讲义”。教员讲到主观与客观、精神与物质、第一性与第二性的时候，就拿一块石头放在课桌上讲解。他们在水库工地上讲解哲学的认识论。教员说：“这水就是自然，是客观，过去咱们涝了怕水，旱了爱水，就是没有办法控制它、利用它。党领导咱们修水库，水来时蓄起它，用时放它。当主观认识了客观的发展规律时，就能使自然为群众造福。”学员范福贵举种庄稼的例子来说明他对矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的关系的理解。他说：“矛盾的普遍性就是所有的庄稼要想达到丰收，必须经过五道关：深耕细作关，优良品种关，施足肥料关，适时浇水关，技术管理关。矛盾的特殊性就是不同的庄稼有不同的要求：红薯丰收要栽浅，玉米丰收要早播，棉花丰收要治虫，麦子丰收在管理。”这里的教员和学员都说：“学哲学虽难，但能深能浅，只要结合实际，结合生产，就能学好，就能掌握。”
    三个月来的哲学学习，使三官庙乡的干部面貌一新，他们开始把学到的哲学原理运用到实际工作中去，把已经做过的实际工作，提高到理论原则来认识。这个乡原来是三类乡，许多乡干部有比较严重的强迫命令作风。党委副书记范运来说：“那时不知道调查研究，不了解客观情况和客观规律，主观决定一切，主观和客观有了矛盾不能统一，怎能不犯错误呢！”现在，党的各项政策指示下达到乡里时，乡干部首先分别研究干部、党团员积极分子、群众和落后群众的思想情况，估计了工作中的有利条件和不利条件，然后召开大会进行一般动员，再分别召开小会，根据具体情况进行动员和布置。这办法收效很大，不仅解决了乡干部工作作风粗糙、简单、一般化的毛病，而且许多具体问题都比较顺利地解决了。这里的乡干部大谈哲学，把日常工作中的缺点提高到哲学上来批判。如贷款多了，预算不符合实际情况，群众对他们有意见，被指斥为“主观”，没有掌握“客观规律”。党委副书记领导搞水库勘测工作时，提出只有进行详细的调查研究，才能确定库址。最近经过勘测设计确定和开工的四十五个水库都很准确。去年由于没有进行详细的调查研究，有40％的库址作废了。现在，因为乡干部的思想方法对头，工作作风有了很大的改进，大家普遍感到工作办法也比过去多了。群众说：“乡干部学习哲学后，出现了三大新气象：调查研究多了；主观主义和强迫命令少了；依靠群众的观点加强了。”
    这个乡的群众在干部学习哲学的影响下，大大破除了迷信。乡里有名的八十岁的“老香头”范随秀，因为他的孙子范大库学了哲学，向他宣传了无神论的哲学观点，今年4月他带头把一千二百三十个泥菩萨送到麦田做肥料。这个乡磨沟村的群众已经开始平整坟墓，已平整的土地都种上了庄稼。这个乡的红专大学已经开设了哲学课，有二百二十四名群众参加了学习。
    现在，三官庙乡的哲学教员和学员都需要一本适合他们教学和学习的哲学课本。他们最初选用的是学习杂志社编的“哲学常识”，但是学习效果很差，讲了几个钟头学员都听不懂，教员才自己编写了“哲学讲义”。可以设想一下，不久的将来，当农村的广大基层干部和几亿农民要求学哲学的时候，这是一个多么重要的问题。哲学家们和有关部门认真考虑和解决这个问题的时候已经到了。
