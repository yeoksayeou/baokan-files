Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 19th: After half a year of hard struggle, Fujian Province has basically eliminated the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania hupensis snail, becoming the first province in China to basically eliminate snails.

In eleven coastal counties of Fujian, including Fuqing, Haicheng, Pingtan, and Zhangpu, the land area with snails reached 13 million square meters. Since the spring of this year, under the leadership of local Party and government organs and the specific guidance of health departments, the people of these areas have organized a million-strong army to repeatedly eliminate snails. Recent inspections and evaluations by relevant departments have shown that the number of snails per thousand square feet has been reduced from tens or hundreds of thousands in the past to less than six, reaching the standard for basic elimination of snails, making it possible for the province to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in a short period.

In the fight against schistosomiasis, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Fujian Province have established specialized institutions. The Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Leading Group of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is headed by Wei Jinshui, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. Party secretaries at all levels in schistosomiasis-affected areas personally took command, leading the snail-killing army to fight on the front lines. Various localities have also strengthened professional prevention and control institutions and fully mobilized the masses to eliminate snails, reversing the conservative ideas of solely relying on experts, technicians, and drug-based snail elimination, thus rapidly advancing the prevention and control work.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 20th: After two years of hard work, the people of Wuyuan County, a mountainous area in Jiangxi Province, have eradicated schistosomiasis, which had been prevalent for over a hundred years. This is the second county in the country to eradicate schistosomiasis, following Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, the first county to do so.

The review team, organized by the Office of the Five-Person Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Group of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and including schistosomiasis prevention and control technical cadres from the province, prefecture, and county, recently conducted a large-scale review of snail elimination, patient treatment, fecal management, and drinking water management in the mountain valley area of Qinghua and Licun townships, the epidemic areas of Wuyuan County, spanning twenty li horizontally and vertically. During the review, only eight snails were found in the ditches, paddy fields, dry lands, wastelands, caves, and ponds, covering an area of over 25,000 square feet where snails used to proliferate. After further snail elimination, not a single snail was found. Fecal samples from 142 of the treated patients were examined, proving a treatment rate of 90%. Small public toilets have been built in the epidemic areas, and feces are centrally stored and managed. Public drinking water and water usage areas have been established, and public water buckets have been set up, fully ensuring the safety of the people's production and life. Based on the results of this review, the review team determined that Wuyuan County has eradicated schistosomiasis. (Image attached)

Hunan's Xiangyin County is an area with a relatively serious schistosomiasis infection. After the Xiangyin County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to "fight hard for one year and eliminate schistosomiasis in 1958," all agricultural cooperatives in the county trained health workers. This is a health worker from Qingtan Cooperative applying iodine to members going out to harvest lake grass to prevent schistosomiasis infection.

    福建省基本消灭钉螺
    婺源县根除血吸虫病
    新华社福州19日电  福建省经过半年苦战，基本消灭了血吸虫的中间宿主钉螺，成为我国第一个基本消灭钉螺的省份。
    福建沿海地区的福清、海澄、平潭和漳浦等十一个县，有钉螺的土地面积达一千三百万平方公尺。今年春季以来，这些地区的人民在当地党政机关的领导下和卫生部门的具体指导下，组织了百万大军，反复进行灭螺。最近经有关部门的检查鉴定，每一千平方市尺面积的钉螺数量，已由过去的几万、几十万只降低到不足六只，达到基本消灭钉螺的标准，使全省有可能在短时期内基本消灭血吸虫病。
    在防治血吸虫病的斗争中，福建省各级党政领导机关都成立了专门机构，中共福建省委的防治血吸虫病领导小组，由省委书记魏金水主持。血吸虫病流行地区的各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，率领灭螺大军，现场作战。各地还加强了专业性的防治机构，并充分发动群众，消灭钉螺，扭转了单纯依靠专家、技术人员和依赖药物灭螺的保守思想，使防治工作迅速向前推进。
    新华社南昌20日电  江西省山区婺源县人民苦战两年，根除了流行一百多年的血吸虫病，这是继全国第一个根除了血吸虫病的县——江西省余江县之后的第二个县。
    由中共江西省委防治血吸虫病五人小组办公室组织的、包括有省、专、县血吸虫病防治技术干部参加的复查小组，最近在婺源县疫区清华、里村等乡的横直二十华里的山谷地带进行了消灭钉螺、治疗病人、粪便管理、饮用水管理的大面积复查。复查中，在往年钉螺蔓生的二万五千多平方市尺面积的水沟、水田、旱地、荒地、山洞、水塘里仅找到了八个钉螺，经过再次灭螺，没有找到一个钉螺。在经过治疗的全部病人中检查了一百四十二人的粪便，证明治疗率达90％。疫区建立了小型公共厕所，集中贮存和管理了粪便，建立了公用的饮水和用水区域，设立了公用水桶，充分保证了人民生产和生活的安全。根据这一复查结果，复查组鉴定婺源县根除了血吸虫病。（附图片）
    湖南湘阴县是血吸虫病感染较严重的一个地区。中共湘阴县委发出“苦战一年，在1958年消灭血吸虫病”的号召后，全县各个农业社都训练了保健员。这是青潭社保健员在给外出打湖草的社员擦碘酒以预防血吸虫病的感染。
