Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 3rd: According to Damascus Radio, on July 2nd, Lebanese insurgent forces continued fierce fighting with pro-Western government troops in the hills near Shemlan village, 20 kilometers south of the capital Beirut, and in the hills near Beirut International Airport. Government troops deployed aircraft, artillery, and armored units in the battle.

    According to today's newspapers, insurgent forces in southern Lebanon surrounded the government troops in Marjayoun on July 2nd and engaged them in battle. The garrison commander requested a ten-hour ceasefire, which the People's Army refused. Fighting resumed, resulting in numerous casualties and captures, including four government army officers.

    The newspapers reported that on the evening of July 2nd, insurgent forces attacked Hasbaya and Yoba south of Baalbek, advancing towards the Bakhsas Bridge connecting Tripoli and Halba. Fighting was reported there, but details are unavailable.

    According to newspapers and radio reports, sporadic fighting also occurred on July 2nd in Tripoli and nearby villages, in certain areas of Beirut, and in Al-Abadiyah, about 20 kilometers east of Beirut.

    "Al- جماهير (The Masses)" newspaper said today that Chamoun's irregular armed forces, which are currently stationed in the hills near Beirut Airport and are suffering heavy blows, stated on July 2nd that they would abandon their positions if the government did not immediately send reinforcements. These armed forces are mainly composed of fascists from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

    Damascus Radio also reported that the last Vatican representative in Beirut had lodged a strong protest with Chamoun, condemning Chamoun's aircraft for bombing the St. Anthony Monastery in Zgharta.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: According to TASS, Athens: Greek newspapers report that U.S. Sixth Fleet warships are now gathering one after another in Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece. A number of U.S. destroyers have arrived in Thessaloniki. "Dawn Daily" believes that the assembly of U.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean is related to U.S. and British plans to intervene in Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: According to TASS, New York, July 1st: As the plot of U.S. imperialists to militarily intervene in Lebanon has aroused a wave of anger throughout the Near East, some American journalists are concerned that the planned intervention will have adverse consequences.

    A "New York Post" reporter believes that U.S. armed intervention will lead to "an endless guerrilla war of Arabs against Americans."

    Walter Lippmann, a Washington commentator for the "New York Herald Tribune," has similar views. He wrote that the Lebanese incident is a civil war, that is, a purely internal affair.

    Lippmann said that if the United States agrees to intervene whenever Chamoun asks for help, then the United States is linking itself to the personal fate of a Lebanese politician. Lippmann warned against a hasty approach to the Lebanese incident, saying, "There is no guarantee that intervention will end successfully."

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: Beirut News: Lebanese pro-Western President Chamoun met with U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock on July 2nd at the ambassador's urgent request. McClintock handed the President the official text of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' recent statement on the Lebanese issue and assured Chamoun that the U.S. government is prepared to intervene if the Lebanese government requests it.

    黎起义部队继续同政府军激战
    美国第六舰队集结希腊港口准备干涉黎巴嫩
    新华社大马士革3日电　据大马士革电台报道，黎巴嫩起义人民部队7月2日在首都贝鲁特以南二十公里处的谢姆兰村附近的山丘中，以及贝鲁特国际机场附近的山丘中继续同亲西方政府部队激战。政府部队出动了飞机、炮兵部队和装甲部队参加战斗。
    据今天的报纸说，在黎巴嫩南部的起义人民部队在7月2日包围了迈尔杰乌荣的政府军，并且同政府军进行了战斗。守军司令曾经要求人民军停战十小时，人民军拒绝了他的要求。随后恢复了战斗，结果有许多人受伤和被俘，其中包括四名政府军军官。
    报纸说，起义人民部队在7月2日晚上攻击了巴尔贝克以南的哈斯巴亚和约巴，并且朝着连接的黎波里和哈勒巴的巴赫萨斯桥挺进。据报道，那里发生了战斗，但是没有得到详细情况。
    据报纸和电台报道，7月2日，在的黎波里和它附近的一些村庄，贝鲁特的某些地区，以及贝鲁特以东约二十公里的阿拉巴迪亚也发生了零星的战斗。
    “群众报”今天说，目前驻在贝鲁特机场附近山丘中受到沉重打击的夏蒙的非正规武装力量，7月2日曾经表示，如果政府不马上派遣援军前往的话，他们就要离开他们的阵地。这些武装力量主要是由国家社会党的法西斯分子组成的。
    大马士革电台还报道，在贝鲁特的最后一个梵蒂冈代表曾经向夏蒙提出了强烈的抗议，谴责夏蒙的飞机轰炸了扎加尔塔的圣安东尼修道院。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：据希腊报纸报道，美国第六舰队的军舰现在正一艘接一艘地在希腊比里犹斯的法勒伦湾集结。一批美国驱逐舰已开抵萨罗尼加。“黎明日报”认为，美国军舰在地中海东部集结是同美英干涉黎巴嫩事件的计划有关系的。
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约1日讯：由于美帝国主义者企图武装干涉黎巴嫩的阴谋在整个中近东引起了愤怒的浪潮，美国的某些报界人士担心正在策划的干涉会引起不利的后果。
    “纽约邮报”记者认为，美国的武装干涉会导致“阿拉伯人反对美国人的无终止的游击战”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”华盛顿评论员李普曼也有类似的看法。他写道，黎巴嫩事件是内战，就是说纯粹是内政问题。
    李普曼说，如果美国答应只要夏蒙求援就进行干涉，那末美国就把自己同黎巴嫩一个政治家的个人命运联系在一起了。李普曼警告不要对黎巴嫩事件采取轻率态度，他说：“认为干涉必将成功结束，这是毫无把握的。”
    据新华社3日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩亲西方的总统夏蒙7月2日应美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克紧急求见的要求接见了他。麦克林托克把美国国务卿杜勒斯最近发表的关于黎巴嫩问题的声明的正式文本交给总统，并向夏蒙保证说，美国政府准备在黎巴嫩政府请求美国政府干涉的情况下进行干涉。
