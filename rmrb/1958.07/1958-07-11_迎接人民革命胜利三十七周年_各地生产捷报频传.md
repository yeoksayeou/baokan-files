    To Greet the 37th Anniversary of the Victory of the People's Revolution
    Production Triumphs Frequently Reported Across the Country
    On the eve of the 37th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11), production triumphs are frequently reported from all over the country. State-owned industry has completed 102.7% of this year's first-half production plan, and cooperative industry has completed 107.1% of the first-half plan. The increase production and practice economy campaign in various regions has also achieved remarkable results.
    In order to implement the resolutions of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and to greet the festival of the victory of the People's Revolution, the Mongolian people have launched a socialist production competition. The workers and staff of various factories and enterprises have not only completed their production tasks, but also put forward many rationalization proposals, saving funds. More than 150 rationalization proposals put forward by workers and staff of factories in Ulaanbaatar alone have saved more than 100,000 tugriks after being adopted. The food joint enterprise in Sukhbaatar Province has completed more than 150% of the first-half plan. The bread, candy, and canned food workshops of this enterprise have saved 30,000 tugriks by increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs.
    Mongolia had no industry before. In the 37 years since the victory of the People's Revolution, with the help of the Soviet Union, Mongolia has newly built many factories, and the output of industrial products has gradually increased. The total output value of industrial products has increased by 69% in the Second Five-Year Plan alone. Industrial production has already accounted for 41% of the total output of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. In the next three years, with the help of fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and China, many new factories will be put into production.

    迎接人民革命胜利三十七周年
    各地生产捷报频传
    在蒙古人民革命胜利三十七周年（7月11日）的前夕，各地生产捷报频传。国营工业已经完成今年上半年生产计划的102.7％，合作社工业完成上半年计划的107.1％，各地的增产节约运动也取得了显著成绩。
    蒙古人民为贯彻执行蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会的决议和迎接人民革命胜利的节日，曾经展开社会主义的生产竞赛。各工厂企业职工不仅在生产上完成了任务，并且提出了许多合理化建议，节约了资金。仅乌兰巴托市各工厂职工提出的一百五十多项合理化建议被采纳以后就节约了十万多图格里克。苏赫巴托尔省的食品联合企业完成了上半年计划的150％以上。这个企业的面包、糖果和罐头车间由于提高了劳动生产率和降低了产品成本，从而节约了三万图格里克。
    蒙古以前没有工业，在人民革命胜利以后的三十七年来，蒙古在苏联的帮助之下已经新建了许多工厂，工业品产量逐渐增多。仅在第二个五年计划内工业品总产量就提高了69％。工业生产已经占工农牧业总生产量的41％。今后三年内，在苏联、中国等兄弟国家的帮助下还将有许多新建的工厂投入生产。
