Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st: The Qixin Agricultural Cooperative in Shangba Township, Yanhe County, a barren mountainous area in northeastern Guizhou Province, harvested 1.2 mu of spring corn on July 15th, yielding a total of 3,966 jin of dry corn, averaging 3,305 jin per mu.

This high-yield figure broke the 1957 record of 2,520.35 jin per mu of spring corn set by the Lelou Cooperative in Chengxian County, Gansu Province; it also once again proves that land is cultivated by people, and various crops can achieve high yields even in barren mountainous areas.

Ten people, including the Party Branch Secretary of the township and the Director of the Qixin Cooperative, participated in the on-site acceptance on the 15th. After the news of the bumper harvest spread, the Ganxi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also sent cadres to inspect it, proving that the situation was completely true.

This high-yield land was deeply ploughed to a depth of 1.2 chi before sowing; the Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) improved variety was selected; dense planting of double plants was implemented (row spacing of 1.5 to 1.8 chi, plant spacing of 9 cun), with 4,215 nests planted per mu. Base fertilizer was applied once, and top dressing was applied three times, using a total of 36,500 jin of fertilizer. Artificial pollination was carried out twice. As a result, each corn plant produced two to three ears, and the largest ear weighed as much as 14 liang and 3 qian.

Yanhe County is a mountainous area with relatively barren land. Last year, the average corn yield per mu in the county was only over 160 jin. This year, the county planted more than 240,000 mu of corn, nearly half of the county's cultivated land, and it is now successively ripening. According to the Yanhe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it is estimated that 80,000 mu can reach an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, and the overall average can reach over 800 jin per mu. The more than 1,000 mu that have already been harvested generally yield around 1,000 jin per mu.

    贫瘠山区放“卫星”
    齐心社亩产玉米3305斤
    新华社贵阳21日电  贵州省东北部贫瘠山区的沿河县上坝乡齐心农业社，在7月15日收割了一亩二分春玉米，共收干玉米三千九百六十六斤，平均亩产三千三百零五斤。
    这个高产数字，打破了1957年甘肃省成县乐楼社所创造的亩产春玉米二千五百二十点三五斤的纪录；同时又一次证实：地在人种，贫瘠山区各种作物都能高产。
    15日参加当场验收的有该乡党支部书记和齐心社主任等十人。丰收喜讯传出后，中共甘溪区委又专门派干部前去检查，证明情况完全真实。
    这块丰产地在播种前深耕达一尺二寸；选用金皇后良种；实行了双株密植（行距一尺五寸至一尺八寸，株距九寸），每亩种四千二百一十五窝。施底肥一次，追肥三次，共用肥三万六千五百斤。人工授粉两次。因而每株玉米生二至三个棒子，最大的棒子一个重达十四两三钱。
    沿河县是个山区，土地比较贫瘠。去年全县玉米平均亩产只有一百六十多斤。今年全县种植玉米二十四万多亩，将近全县耕地二分之一，目前相继开始黄熟。据中共沿河县委预计，其中有八万亩可达平均亩产一千斤以上，总平均也可达亩产八百多斤。现已收割的一千多亩，亩产一般都在一千斤上下。
