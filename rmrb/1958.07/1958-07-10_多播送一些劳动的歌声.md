　　Broadcast More Songs of Labor

　　I often see some construction sites, factories, mines, and other enterprises playing records through their broadcasting stations during production hours, some playing songs and some playing operas. This is permissible as long as it doesn't affect production. The problem is: some construction site broadcasting stations have failed to effectively promote production with the records they play. For example, some broadcasting stations repeatedly play Ping opera records like "…I'm nineteen, he's eleven, he doesn't understand anything…" "Birds go to the forest, chickens go to the coop…" "The stream flows gently…" It's not that these kinds of records shouldn't be played, but rather that they hardly boost the morale of the workers and staff who are working hard. The tone is also very discordant.

　　I think there are many good songs that can be broadcast now, such as "The Working Class is Strong," "Building the Motherland with High Enthusiasm," "Labor Emulation Song," "The Motherland is Leaping Forward," "Socialism is Good," "Catch Up with England in Fifteen Years," truly countless. Record companies should also quickly produce some good new songs into records.

　　I hope that in the wave of the Socialist Great Leap Forward, the broadcasting stations of various construction sites, factories, mines, and other enterprises will let the songs of labor be everywhere!

### 多播送一些劳动的歌声

    多播送一些劳动的歌声
    我常看到一些工地、工厂和矿山等企业单位在生产时间里，通过广播站播送一些唱片，有的播送歌曲有的播送戏曲。这，在不影响生产的前提下未尝不可。问题是：有的工地广播站所播送的唱片未能很好起到促进生产的作用。例如，有的广播站翻来复去的播送评剧唱片“……我十九，他十一，事事他都不懂得……”“鸟入林，鸡上窝……”“小河流水哗啦啦……”。倒不是说这类唱片不可以播送，而是说，这对于正在紧张劳动中的工人和职员，很难起到鼓舞生产情绪的作用。在情调上也是很不协调的。
    我觉得现在有很多好的歌曲都可以播送的，如：“咱们工人有力量”“建设祖国热情高”“劳动竞赛歌”“祖国在飞跃前进”“社会主义好”“十五年赶上英国”，真是不胜枚举。唱片厂也应尽快地把一些好的新歌灌制成唱片。
    希望各工地、工厂、矿山等企业广播站，在社会主义大跃进的声浪中，让劳动的歌声到处洋溢吧！
