Protesting American and British Pirate Aggression Against Middle Eastern Countries
People in Britain, Italy, India, and Other Countries Hold Rallies and Demonstrations
Britain
More than a thousand British people held a mass rally in Hyde Park, London, on the 20th, protesting American and British armed intervention in the Middle East. This marks the beginning of a great mass movement demanding an end to the dirty war of aggression and the withdrawal of American and British invading forces from the Middle East.
The mass rally was organized by the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Participants marched from Hyde Park to Holborn Hall in central London to hear speeches by Communist Party General Secretary Gollan and others. The demonstrators held up placards and shouted slogans: "Stop the dirty war! Stop interfering in Arab countries! Long live the Republic of Iraq! We demand peace!" These slogans won cheers and applause from the crowds along the way.
Later, a delegation delivered copies of the resolution passed at the meeting, demanding the immediate withdrawal of American and British troops from the Middle East, to the British Prime Minister and the American Ambassador. At the same time, another resolution was handed to Macmillan, demanding that the government accept Khrushchev's proposal to immediately convene a summit meeting.
Italy
People throughout Italy have been holding demonstrations to protest the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Middle Eastern countries.
During a demonstration in Naples on the 19th, demonstrators, disregarding police obstruction, marched forward holding placards with slogans such as "Americans get out of the Middle East" and "Give freedom to the Arab people."
Demonstrations were also held in Bologna, Turin, Pisa, and Taranto. Workers in many enterprises in Ancona passed resolutions condemning Anglo-American imperialists. The resolutions have been sent to the American and British embassies in Rome. Many cities have also posted propaganda posters strongly condemning the aggressors.
Strikes were held at the "Ansaldo" shipyard in Livorno, the "Gerozzo" and "Tosi" factories in Milan, and the "CIM" factory in Venice to protest American and British acts of aggression against Arab countries.
India
Delhi citizens held a mass rally at the Town Hall on the evening of the 20th, organized by the Delhi Peace Committee. In a resolution, the meeting warned the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom that the awakened and peace-loving people of Asia and Africa would not tolerate imperialist attempts to plunge the world into another war.
All the speakers, including trade union members, party leaders, and social workers, expressed the Indian people's indignation at the Anglo-American aggression in the Middle East, and they called on the people to unite against this aggression. Mrs. Sharma, a member of the Delhi Municipal Corporation, reminded people of how the Indian people had suffered under imperialist rule in the past. She said that we cannot tolerate any attacks on India's neighbors, and we cannot allow the people of Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon to become slaves of the United States and the United Kingdom.
The speakers cheered the newborn Republic of Iraq and believed that India should immediately recognize the Republic of Iraq. One speaker, condemning Anglo-American aggression, said, "If they do not withdraw from the Middle East, we should declare that we are prepared to answer them."
Indonesia
On the night of the 20th, many slogans against American and British aggression in Middle Eastern countries appeared throughout Jakarta.
On the streets, slogans calling on the Indonesian people to support the Republic of Iraq and protest against the dispatch of troops by the United States and Britain to invade Lebanon and Jordan are becoming more and more numerous.
Representatives of many people's organizations went to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request that their protest letters be handed over to the embassies of the United States and Britain. These protest letters unanimously condemned the piratical acts of aggression by the United States and Britain against Middle Eastern countries, and demanded that they immediately withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
Some veterans' organizations in Indonesia have stated that if the United States and Britain stubbornly persist in their aggressive actions, these organizations are prepared to send volunteers to defend peace in the Middle East. Some trade union organizations have warned that they will take necessary actions against American enterprises in Indonesia. (Xinhua News Agency)

    抗议美英海盗侵略中东各国
    英意印等国人民举行集会示威游行
    英国
    一千多英国人20日在伦敦海德公园举行群众大会，抗议美英武装干涉中东。这标志着要求停止肮脏的侵略战争和要求美英侵略军队撤离中东的伟大群众运动的开端。
    这次群众大会是由英国共产党伦敦区委员会组织的，参加集会的人从海德公园前往伦敦市中心的荷尔本大厦，听取共产党总书记高兰和其他人的演说。游行的人们高举标语牌和高呼口号：“停止肮脏的战争！停止干涉阿拉伯国家！伊拉克共和国万岁！我们要求和平！”这些口号赢得路旁的人群的欢呼和鼓掌。
    后来，代表团把会上通过的要求美英军队立即撤出中东的决议的抄件交给了英国首相和美国大使。同时，还交给麦克米伦另一项决议，要求政府接受赫鲁晓夫提出的立即召开最高级会议的建议。意大利
   意大利全国各地人民纷纷举行示威游行，抗议美英两国对中东国家的武装侵略。
    19日在那不勒斯举行的游行中，示威者不顾警察的阻挠高举着标语牌前进，标语牌上写着“美国人滚出中东去”、“给阿拉伯人民以自由”等口号。
    在波伦亚、都灵、彼萨、大兰多都举行了示威游行。安科纳许多企业的工人通过决议，谴责英美帝国主义者。决议已经寄给美国和英国驻罗马的大使馆。许多城市还张贴了宣传画，严厉谴责侵略者。
    里窝那“安莎尔多”造船厂、米兰“热洛佐”和“陶斯”工厂、威尼斯“齐姆”工厂都举行了罢工，抗议美英对阿拉伯国家的侵略行动。
    印度
    德里市民20日晚上在德里和平委员会的组织下在市政厅举行了群众大会。会议在一项决议中警告美国和联合王国政府说，亚非觉醒了的和爱好和平的人民将不会容忍帝国主义企图把世界投入另一次战争的尝试。
    包括工会会员、各党领袖和社会工作者在内的所有发言的人都表示了印度人民对英美侵略中东的愤慨，他们呼吁人民一致起来反对这种侵略。德里市政机构委员夏尔马夫人在讲话中提醒人们印度人民过去在帝国主义统治下是怎样受苦的。她说，我们不能容忍对印度邻国的任何进攻，我们不能容忍约旦、伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民成为美国和联合王国的奴隶。
    发言的人向新生的伊拉克共和国欢呼，并且认为印度应该立即承认伊拉克共和国。一个发言的人在谴责英美的侵略时说，“如果它们不撤出中东的话，我们应该宣布我们准备回答他们。”印度尼西亚
    在20日夜里，雅加达全市出现了许多反对美国和英国侵略中东国家的标语。
    在大街上，号召印度尼西亚人民支援伊拉克共和国和抗议美英派遣军队侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的标语是愈来愈多了。
    许多人民团体的代表到印度尼西亚外交部去，要求把它们的抗议书交给美国和英国的大使馆。这些抗议书一致谴责美英侵略中东国家的海盗行为，并且要求它们立即从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出它们的部队。
    印度尼西亚的一些退伍军人组织已经表示，如果美国和英国顽固地坚持它们的侵略行动，这些组织准备派遣志愿军去保卫中东的和平。一些工会组织警告说，它们将对美国在印度尼西亚的企业采取必要的行动。  （据新华社讯）
