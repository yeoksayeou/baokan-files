    The "Eyes" of Petroleum Geological Work
    Multi-Wire Automatic Downhole Electrical Logging Instrument Born in Xi'an

    China's first domestically designed and manufactured multi-wire automatic downhole electrical logging instrument was recently born at the Xi'an Geophysical Instrument Factory. After national technical appraisal, it was considered that the working performance and logging effectiveness of this instrument exceed those of instruments manufactured in the United States, reaching the advanced world level.

    The electrical logging instrument is an instrument used to study underground formations and oil layers during the drilling process, and is known as the eye of petroleum geological work. With the development of China's petroleum exploration, there is an urgent need for many automated electrical logging instruments, but in the past, China could not manufacture them, and it was not easy to order them from abroad. Liu Yongnian, chief engineer of the Xi'an Geophysical Instrument Factory, was determined to research and manufacture this advanced instrument several years ago. He used a semi-automatic electrical logging instrument at the Shaanbei Electrical Logging Station for countless on-site tests and obtained many important data. Based on these data, he also referred to the physical objects of Soviet automatic electrical logging instruments, while conducting comprehensive research and starting to design a multi-wire automatic electrical logging instrument. In this way, after several years of painstaking research, with the support of party and government leaders and the help of factory workers, he finally succeeded in the trial production.

    The biggest advantage of this multi-wire electrical logging instrument is that it can measure five curves in one downhole run, while American electrical logging instruments can only measure a maximum of four curves. According to preliminary estimates, its logging time efficiency is two to three times higher than that of general electrical logging instruments. (Xinhua News Agency)

    石油地质工作的“眼睛”
    多线式自动井下电测仪在西安诞生
    我国自己设计、自己制造的第一部国产多线式自动井下电测仪，最近在西安地球物理仪器厂诞生。经过国家技术鉴定，认为这部仪器的工作性能和测井效能，都超过美国制造的仪器，达到世界先进的水平。
    电测仪是用于钻井过程中研究井下地层和油层情况的仪器，被人们称为石油地质工作的眼睛。随着我国石油勘探事业的发展，急需很多自动化电测仪，但是过去我国不能制造，向国外订货也不容易。西安地球物理仪器厂总工程师刘永年，在几年以前就下定决心研究制造这种高级仪器。他在陕北电测站用一个半自动电测仪作过无数次现场试验，取得很多重要资料。根据这些资料，他又参照苏联自动电测仪实物，一面进行综合研究，一面开始设计多线式自动电测仪。这样，他经过几年苦心钻研，在党政领导的支持和厂内职工的帮助下，终于试制成功。
    这种多线式电测仪最大的优点是：下井一次可以测出五条曲线，而美国的电测仪最多只能测四条曲线。据初步测算，它的测井时效比一般电测仪要高二倍至三倍。　（新华社）
