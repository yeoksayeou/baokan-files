    Is This "Wasteful"?
    Bai Sheng
    Education serving politics, the combination of education and labor, and cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture are the socialist education policies. They are fundamentally different from capitalist education policies. Implementing socialist education policies is a major revolution in school education.
    In the past period, higher education institutions in various regions have already made many achievements in combining education and labor. For example, work-study programs, schools partnering with factories and rural areas, running their own factories and farms, designing and trial-producing new products, and engaging in large-scale productive labor have enabled students to be tempered in labor and have also improved the quality of teaching. However, the separation of education from productive labor has deep historical and profound class roots. Therefore, the idea that "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior" is still deeply ingrained in some intellectuals. Some people say that it is simply a "waste" and "overqualified" for university graduates to become workers or farmers. Some people say that the combination of education and labor will inevitably reduce the quality of education and affect China's ability to achieve international standards in science and technology. Some even hold serious resentment. Although many students have already been involved in the upsurge of productive labor under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, there are still many muddled ideas and they sway with the wind.
    To be a laborer with socialist consciousness and culture, or to be an intellectual who is physically inactive and knows nothing about farming? This is a serious question facing young students. Labor created the world, promoted social progress, and at the same time transformed humanity itself. Only by actively participating in labor and first becoming ordinary workers and farmers after graduation can young students train themselves into both red and expert working-class intellectuals, meet the requirements of the socialist motherland, and not be a "waste." This truth has already begun to point out the way in people's minds in the discussions of "red" versus "expert," in the discussions of going to the countryside for training, and in the "double anti" movement.
    Now, in order to carry out teaching reforms and cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, some higher education institutions have launched debates on issues such as whether or not to be a laborer. At Peking University, this debate has reached a climax among all students. This is very beneficial for further clarifying right and wrong, raising awareness, and better engaging in the practice of productive labor. We hope that young students can all join this great debate on education policy. In the debate, dispel concerns, boldly expose ideas, and through self-criticism and criticism of others, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and truly consciously revolutionize and continuously revolutionize, to become a laborer with socialist consciousness and culture.

    这是“浪费”吗？
    柏生
    教育为政治服务，教育与劳动结合，培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，是社会主义的教育方针。它和资本主义教育方针，有着根本的区别。贯彻社会主义教育方针，是学校教育的一场重大革命。
    各地高等学校在教育和劳动结合方面，过去一个时期，已经做出许多成绩。如勤工俭学，学校同工厂农村挂钩，自己办工厂、农场，设计和试制新产品，大搞生产劳动，使学生在劳动中受到锻炼，教学质量也有了提高。但是，教育脱离生产劳动，有长远的历史根源和深刻的阶级根源，因而在一些知识分子中“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的思想还根深蒂固。有人说，大学毕业去当工人、农民，简直是“浪费”，“大材小用”。有人说，教育与劳动结合势必降低教育质量，影响我国的科学技术不能达到国际水平。甚至有人抱着严重的抵触情绪。许多学生虽然在大跃进的形势下，已经卷入了生产劳动的热潮中，但也还有不少糊涂观念，随风摇摆。
    做有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，还是做四体不勤、五谷不分的脱离劳动的知识分子？这是摆在青年学生面前的严重问题。劳动创造了世界，也推动了社会前进，同时改造了人类自己。青年学生只有积极参加劳动，在毕业后首先去做一个普通的工人、农民，才能把自己锻炼成又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，才能适应社会主义祖国的要求，才不是“浪费”。这一真理，在“红”与“专”的讨论中，在下乡锻炼的讨论中，在“双反”运动中，都已经开始在人们的思想上指明了道路。
    现在，某些高等学校为了进行教学改革，为了培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，展开了要不要做劳动者等问题的辩论。在北京大学全体学生中，这场辩论已经形成高潮。这对进一步辩明是非，提高思想，更好地从事生产劳动的实践是非常有益的。我们希望青年学生都能投到这场教育方针的大辩论中来。在辩论中，解除顾虑，大胆暴露思想，通过自我批评与对别人的批评，坚持真理，修正错误，真正自觉革命，不断革命，做一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
