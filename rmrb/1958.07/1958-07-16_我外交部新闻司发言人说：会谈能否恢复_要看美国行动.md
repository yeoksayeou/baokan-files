Xinhua News Agency, July 15th – A spokesperson for the News Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today made the following statement to a reporter from this agency regarding the Sino-U.S. talks:

    According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on July 14th, U.S. officials said that the United States will disregard China's demand to resume the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks within fifteen days, and will appoint an ambassadorial representative a few days after the fifteen-day deadline, suggesting that the talks resume at a new location.

    The U.S. unilaterally interrupted the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks for as long as six months, violating the agreement between the two sides. The Chinese government's demand on June 30th to resume the talks within fifteen days is entirely reasonable. In fact, the U.S. also knows that it is in the wrong, so on July 1st, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles expressed his willingness to resume the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, but was unwilling to be bound by the fifteen-day deadline for the sake of face. It is understandable that the U.S. wants to save face. The purpose of China's fifteen-day deadline was originally to urge the U.S. to abide by the agreement, appoint an ambassador, and resume the talks. Now that the U.S. claims that it is willing to quickly resume the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, postponing the time by a few days is not unacceptable.

    However, it must be pointed out that the U.S. often does not match its words with its deeds, and what it says cannot be counted on. Whether the U.S. will actually appoint an ambassador and resume the talks quickly, as it claims, remains to be seen through its actions.

### 我外交部新闻司发言人说：会谈能否恢复　要看美国行动

    我外交部新闻司发言人说：
    会谈能否恢复　要看美国行动
    新华社15日讯　外交部新闻司发言人就中美会谈问题今日对本社记者发表谈话如下：
    据合众国际社7月14日华盛顿电，美国官员说，美国将不顾中国在十五天内恢复中美大使级会谈的要求，而将在十五天期限过后的几天内指派大使级代表，建议在一个新的地点，恢复会谈。
    美国违反双方协议、片面中断中美大使级会谈达六个月之久，中国政府在6月30日提出在十五天内恢复会谈的要求是完全合理的。其实美国也自知理亏，所以在7月1日美国国务卿杜勒斯就表示要恢复中美大使级会谈，但是碍于情面，不准备受十五天期限的约束。美国要点面子，这也是可以了解的。中国提出十五天限期的目的，原本是要美国遵守协议、指派大使、恢复会谈。现在，美国既然声称愿意迅速恢复中美大使级会谈，推迟几天时间也无不可。
    但是，必须指出，美国往往是言行不符，说了不算的。美国究竟是否像它所声称的那样，迅速指派大使、恢复会谈，还要看它用行动来证明。
