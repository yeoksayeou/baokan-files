We know that we are not isolated in this struggle, and we know that all peace-loving and free countries stand with us. What we hope is to defend our freedom and the interests of our country, and we hope to contribute to world peace."

    Prime Minister Qasim is a simple and brave general. At his first press conference, he said: "This new government comes from the people and the whole country, and serves the whole country. I personally am prepared to sacrifice my life for the Republic of Iraq and the interests of this country."
    The government officials and people of the Republic of Iraq are friendly and enthusiastic towards the Chinese people.
