    Notes
    Alas, “Free World”!
    The Soviet State Folk Dance Ensemble, led by Igor Moiseyev, toured the United States from April to June this year and was warmly welcomed by American audiences. American theater professionals generally believe that "America has never seen such a performance." However, the warm praise the dance troupe won among ordinary American audiences made the gentlemen of the "Un-American Activities Committee" restless. They severely interrogated an American band conductor named Artie Ryff, who had accompanied the dance troupe, accusing him of participating in some "communist conspiracy." After the "Un-American Activities Committee" made this musician dizzy with trumped-up charges, they persecuted him, and he couldn't even keep his job.
    In addition to Ryff, the "Un-American Activities Committee" also persecuted nine other American cultural workers involved in the performance.
    Needless to say, the "Un-American Activities Committee's" despicable methods are aimed at undermining cultural exchanges between the Soviet and American people. The American ruling group is afraid of this kind of cultural exchange, even afraid of the success of a Soviet dance troupe in the United States, which shows how worthless that much-vaunted "free world" is. Because that "free world" cannot even withstand the successful performance of a dance troupe from a socialist country. Alas, "free world"!
    Two Suction Tubes
    According to Iran's "Tehran Pictorial," there are currently 1,084 foreign companies with agencies in Iran. These foreign companies control Iran's trade, mining, and exploration enterprises, import large quantities of various commodities, and extract huge profits from Iran amounting to 100 million pounds each year.
    But this is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, foreign monopoly capital, mainly the Anglo-American oil consortium, plunders tens of millions of tons of oil from Iran every year, while only paying Iran a small amount of oil tax. Taking 1957 as an example, Iran's oil tax revenue was only 71 million pounds, which is only a very small proportion of the total profits of the oil consortium. However, this limited income is only fleeting wealth, and in the blink of an eye, it is completely sucked dry by more than a thousand foreign companies.
    Exporting oil at low prices and importing industrial products at high prices are the two suction tubes used by international monopoly capital to carry out economic plunder of oil-rich countries in the Middle East. Iran's experience provides a strong proof.

    札记
    哀哉，“自由世界”！
    由叶戈尔·莫伊塞耶夫率领的苏联国家民间舞蹈团，从今年4月到6月在美国各地进行巡回演出，受到了美国观众的热烈欢迎。美国戏剧界人士普遍认为：“美国从来没有看到过这样的演出”。但是，舞蹈团在美国普通观众中赢得的热烈赞扬，却使“非美活动调查委员会”的老爷们坐立不安。他们对曾为舞蹈团伴奏的一个名叫阿尔图·里夫的美国乐队指挥严加审讯，诬陷他参与了什么“共产主义阴谋”。“非美活动调查委员会”以莫须有的罪名把这个音乐工作者弄得头昏脑胀之后，并对他进行了迫害，甚至他的饭碗都保不住了。
    除里夫之外，“非美活动调查委员会”还迫害了与这次演出有关的其他九个美国文化工作者。
    不用说，“非美活动调查委员会”的这种卑劣的作法，其目的是要破坏苏美两国人民的文化交流。美国统治集团害怕这种文化交流，甚至害怕苏联的一个舞蹈团在美国所获得的成功，这说明那个被吹嘘得天花乱坠的“自由世界”，是如何一钱不值的东西。因为，那个“自由世界”甚至经受不住社会主义国家一个舞蹈团的成功的演出。哀哉，“自由世界”！
    两条吸血管
    据伊朗的“德黑兰画报”透露，目前有一千零八十四家外国公司在伊朗设有代理机构。这些外国公司控制了伊朗的贸易、采矿和勘察企业，输入大批各种商品，每年从伊朗榨取了数达一亿英镑的巨额利润。
    但是，这只是事情的一个方面。另一方面，外国垄断资本，主要是美英石油财团，每年从伊朗掠夺数千万吨石油，而只付给伊朗很小一笔石油税。以1957年为例，伊朗石油税的收入不过七千一百万镑，仅占石油财团利润总数的一个很小的比额。然而，这笔有限的收入也只是过手财，转眼之间，就被一千多家外国公司吸得干干净净了。
    低价输出石油、高价输入工业品，这是国际垄断资本对中东丰产石油的国家进行经济掠夺的两条吸血管。伊朗的遭遇提供了一个有力的证明。
