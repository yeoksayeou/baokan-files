    Self-Establishing Factories, Self-Manufacturing Machinery
    Beijing Construction Enterprises Marching Towards Full Mechanization

    (Our report) Beijing's construction enterprises' technical innovation movement, after "laying down the carrying pole" and basically eliminating shoulder-carrying and manual lifting, has entered a new stage of comprehensively advancing towards mechanization and factory construction. The main characteristics of this stage are: adopting a method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, establishing industries at all levels, and manufacturing construction machinery themselves.

    In mid-June, Beijing's construction companies put forward the slogan "Work hard for seven days, lay down the carrying pole, and eliminate shoulder-carrying and manual lifting" as the first step in the technical innovation movement. By June 23, this struggle task was basically victoriously completed. The companies then immediately directed the spearhead of the mass technical innovation movement towards a comprehensive revolution in production technology. Their main methods were: First, fully utilizing existing foundations, strengthening machinery manufacturing capabilities, transforming repair shops into manufacturing plants, vigorously running on-site small factories, independently creating and manufacturing medium-sized and small machinery, and mass-producing simple indigenous machinery and advanced tools. Second, producing raw materials themselves, such as building indigenous blast furnaces and small converters to smelt iron and steel, and building cement plants to produce building materials.

    Currently, the work of establishing factories is rapidly developing. The Second Construction Engineering Company's small converter has already produced steel; they are also preparing to build a steel bar rolling workshop to manufacture some of their own steel bars. The parts factory affiliated with this company is being expanded and has already trial-produced silicon steel; after the expansion of this factory is completed, it will mass-produce indigenous machinery and general construction machinery. The Third Construction Company has already started and is preparing to establish thirteen small factories or workshops, including a machinery manufacturing plant, a cement plant, a plumbing equipment processing plant, and a waste wood processing plant. The indigenous cement kilns built by the Fourth Construction Company and other units are already producing in large quantities.

    The broad masses of workers have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in manufacturing construction machinery. They have already created and manufactured more than ten types of machinery, such as electric tampers, combined sand sifters, grooving machines, bricklaying machines, and plastering machines. Among them, electric tampers are already being manufactured in large quantities, and by the end of the year, these machines can be used to liberate workers on various construction sites from the heavy labor of tamping.

    自己办厂  自制机械
    北京建筑企业向机械化全面进军
    本报讯　北京市建筑企业的技术革新运动，在“放下扁担”，基本上消灭了肩挑人抬现象以后，已经转入向机械化、工厂化施工全面进军的新阶段。这一阶段的主要特点是：采取土洋结合，以土为主的办法，层层办工业，自己制造建筑机械。
    6月中旬，北京各建筑公司提出“苦战七天，放下扁担，消灭肩挑人抬”的口号，作为技术革新运动的第一步。到6月23日，这一斗争任务就基本上胜利完成了。各公司紧接着把群众性技术革新运动的锋芒，引向了生产技术全面大革命。他们主要的作法是：第一、充分利用现有基础，加强机械制造力量，变修理厂为制造厂，大力举办工地型的小工厂，自创自制中小型机械，大量制造简便的土机械和先进工具。第二、自己生产原料，如建设土高炉、小转炉，炼铁炼钢，建设水泥厂等生产建筑材料。
    现在，办厂工作正在迅速开展。第二建筑工程公司建设的小转炉，已经出钢；他们又在筹建钢筋压延车间，准备自制一部分钢筋。这个公司所属的配件厂正在扩建，并已试制出矽钢；这个厂扩建完工以后，将大量制造土机械和一般建筑机械。第三建筑公司已经着手和准备兴办十三个小型工厂或车间，其中有机械制造厂、水泥厂、水暖器材加工厂、废木料加工厂等。第四建筑公司等单位办的土水泥窑等已在大量生产。
    广大职工在制造建筑机械方面发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。他们已经创造和制造出电动打夯机、联合筛砂机、刨槽机、砌砖机、抹灰机等十多种机械。其中电动打夯机已在大量制造，年底以前可以用这种机械把各工地工人从打夯的笨重劳动中解放出来。
