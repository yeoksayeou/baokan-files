Xinhua News Agency, London, July 29th: British public opinion widely opposes the United States and Britain delaying the convocation of a summit conference.

    British Labour Member of Parliament Stephen Swingler stated in the House of Commons on the 28th that he warmly welcomed Khrushchev's "prompt and constructive response" to Macmillan's letter of July 22nd. Swingler demanded that the government guarantee that no difficulties would hinder the holding of a summit conference to discuss the Middle East issue.

    Labour Lord Henderson also called for an early summit to discuss the Middle East issue during a foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords on the 29th. He said, "The important thing now is to hold a meeting, and to hold it quickly." He pointed out, "Wasting time cannot resolve the crisis. The British and American governments were quick enough to send armed forces to Lebanon and Jordan, so they should also act quickly in arranging a meeting to try to resolve the problem."

    Several London newspapers believe that the United States is the main culprit in sabotaging the summit conference.

    The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" condemned the United States for delaying the convocation of the summit conference by using methods such as "endless drivel, discussions, shouting, and malicious pretenses." The newspaper demanded that the West "show some positive effort by setting a firm date for the meeting."

    The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said that if the United States attempts to cancel the meeting, it is completely wrong. The newspaper said that what is "urgently needed is to get the meeting going, and the West's correct response should be to propose a definite date to Khrushchev."

    Even the "Times," which is usually close to the government, expressed disapproval of indefinitely delaying the holding of a high-level meeting. The paper believes: "We are faced with the threat of marking time."

    浪费时间不能解决危机
    英国舆论要西方提出确切日期
    新华社伦敦29日电　英国舆论广泛反对美国和英国拖延召开政府首脑会议。
    英国工党议员斯蒂芬·斯文格勒28日在下院中表示热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫对麦克米伦7月22日的信件所作的“毫不迟延的建设性的回答。”斯文格勒要求政府保证不要让任何困难妨碍召开讨论中东问题的政府首脑会议。
    工党上院议员汉德逊勋爵29日在上院的外交辩论中也要求早日召开最高级会议来讨论中东问题。他说，“现在的重要事情是召开会议，并且要迅速召开。”他指出，“浪费时间不能解决危机。英国和美国政府在派遣武装部队前往黎巴嫩和约旦的时候动作是足够迅速的，因此在安排会议来设法解决问题时它们也应该迅速地行动才对。”
    有几家伦敦报纸认为，美国是破坏最高级会议的主犯。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”谴责美国“用无休无止的废话、讨论、叫嚷和恶意伪装烦恼”等等方法来拖延召开最高级会议，报纸要求西方“用确定会议日期的方法来表示某种积极的努力”。
    工党的“每日先驱报”说，如果美国企图取消会议，那么它就完全错了。这家报纸说，现在“迫切需要的是使会议开起来，西方的正确答复应该是向赫鲁晓夫提出一个确切的日期。”
    连通常接近政府的“泰晤士报”也表示不赞成无限期地拖延召开高级会议。该报认为：“我们面临着踏步不前的威胁”。
