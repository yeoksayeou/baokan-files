Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - According to a report by the "Al-Ahram" correspondent in Baghdad on July 23rd, the government of the Iraqi Republic has discovered secret documents recording the meetings of the Baghdad Pact member states. These documents indicate that "Israel was originally intended to be a secret base for the pact." The documents also "contain the names of those countries that must be conquered by force to bring them under the control of the West."

In related news, an Associated Press dispatch from London on the same day stated that the US-UK "top secret plan" to invade the Middle East has fallen into the hands of the Iraqi Republic government, which has caused great panic among the US and UK authorities.

The news revealed that some of these documents "will be very useful to those countries that are 'hostile' to the Baghdad Pact member states."

    美英侵略中东密计藏不住了
    新华社24日讯　据开罗“金字塔报”驻巴格达记者23日报道，伊拉克共和国政府已经发现记载巴格达条约成员国会议情况的秘密文件。这些文件表明“以色列原定成为该条约的一个秘密基地”。文件中并且“载有那些必须用武力征服使之屈从西方的国家的名字”。
    另据美联社同一天的伦敦消息说，美英侵略中东的“绝密计划”已经落入伊拉克共和国政府手中，这使美英当局非常恐慌。
    消息透露，这些文件有一些对于那些对巴格达条约成员国“怀有敌意的国家将是非常有用的”。
