    Overall Leap Forward, All-Around Bumper Harvest
    Sun Yuedong
  In striving for increased production and bumper harvests of major crops like grain and cotton, how to ensure that other cash crops and minor grains can also achieve an overall leap forward and all-around bumper harvest is a problem worthy of attention in current agricultural production.

    In the great leap forward in agricultural production, all regions have been seizing the increase in production of major crops such as grain and cotton. Wheat, rice, and other grain crops have created many new high-yield records, which is a major event. However, we must go further and on no account be content with this. We must also demand bumper harvests in other areas. Whether it is scattered or small-scale production, whether it is grain crops or cash crops, whether it is agricultural production or sideline production, we should strive for an overall leap forward. Only in this way can we promote the overall development of the national economy and better improve the daily life of the people.

    It should be recognized that with the continuous improvement of people's lives, the types of agricultural products and non-staple foods needed by the people are also constantly increasing. Therefore, we must establish an overall leap forward perspective and comprehensively develop agricultural production. We must not just hold on to the "watermelon" and lose the "sesame seeds." These "sesame seeds" may seem small, but they are indispensable to people's lives. Take glutinous rice, for example. It may seem dispensable to the average person, and they can eat less or not eat it at all, but pregnant women in southern regions need to use it to make *jiuniang* (fermented glutinous rice), which they eat to nourish their bodies. However, this year some agricultural cooperatives have not arranged production at all and have completely squeezed out glutinous rice. What's more, some crops are directly related to industrial raw materials and national export goods, so they cannot be regarded as a trivial matter.

    Sichuan has noticed this problem and is striving for a bumper harvest of various crops, which is very good. Regions that have not paid attention to this in the past should also pay attention to it. There is still some time before the autumn harvest, and even in areas where the autumn harvest in the south is earlier, crops that have not received enough attention can still be remedied by increasing planting, intercropping, and relay planting. For some crops that are already a foregone conclusion and cannot increase the sown area, quickly try to strengthen field management and strive to increase the yield per unit area. Some areas have the conditions and habits of increasing the planting of a late autumn crop, and they can also make arrangements for increasing the planting of late autumn crops as soon as possible, grab it again, and plug the loopholes. It is not too late.

    全面跃进  样样丰收
    孙跃东
  在争取粮棉主要作物的增产丰收中，如何保证其他经济作物和小宗杂粮也能全面跃进，样样丰收，是当前农业生产中值得注意的问题。
    在农业生产大跃进中，各地都抓紧了粮棉等主要作物的增产。小麦、水稻及其他粮食作物，创造了许多高产新纪录，这是大事情。但是，百尺竿头更进一步，我们决不能以此满足，还要求在其他方面也要丰收。不论是零星的或小宗的生产；也不论是粮食作物还是经济作物；无论是农业生产，还是副业生产；都应力争全面跃进。只有这样，才能促进国民经济的全面发展，也才能更好地改善人民的日常生活。
    应当认识：随着人民生活的不断提高，人民所需要的农产品和副食品的种类也在不断地增加，因此必须树立全面跃进观点，全面发展农业生产。不能只抱住“西瓜”而丢了“芝麻”。这些“芝麻”看来虽小，但是却为人民生活所不可缺少。就拿糯米来说，在一般人看来也许是可有可无的东西，可以少吃或者不吃，但是在南方地区的产妇，却需要用它来制成?醩，吃了滋补身体。可是今年有些地方的农业社却完全没有安排生产，把糯米全部挤掉了。何况有些作物还直接关系到工业原料和国家出口物资，因之也就不能当成一件小事。
    四川注意到这个问题，并力争各种作物全面丰收，这是很好的。过去没有注意的地区，也要引起注意。现在离秋收还有一段时间，即使南方秋收较早的地区，对有些注意不够的作物也还可以通过增种、间种、套种等办法，来加以补救。对一些已成定局，无法增加播种面积的作物，那就赶快设法加强田间管理，努力提高单位面积产量。有些地区有增种一季晚秋作物的条件和习惯，也可以及早在增种晚秋作物中加以安排，再抓一把，将漏洞堵塞起来，也为时不晚。
