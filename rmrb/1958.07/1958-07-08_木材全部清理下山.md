    All Timber Cleared Down the Mountain
    The criticism of our bureau by comrades Wu Yongnian and Chen Hongliang, published in the People's Daily on April 7th, regarding the fact that 1,500 cubic meters of timber in Daping and Yangtou, Zhangcuo Township, in our county were left unmanaged, is completely true. We sincerely accept the criticism. After the publication of this criticism in the newspaper, we immediately organized manpower and within forty days cleared all usable timber and firewood down the mountain. It was a mistake for our bureau not to process this batch of timber in a timely manner, allowing it to remain on the mountain and rot for a long time. In the future, in addition to formulating a responsibility system for inspecting mountain areas after logging is completed and strictly implementing it, we guarantee that this phenomenon will not occur again.

    木材全部清理下山
    4月7日人民日报刊登吴永年、陈宏良同志批评我局存在本县张厝乡大坪、洋头一千五百立方公尺木材没人管理的事完全属实，我们诚恳地接受批评，并在报上发表这一批评后，即组织人力在四十天内把能利用的和能当薪柴的木材全部清理下山。我局对这批木材不能及时处理，长期滞留山上腐朽是错误的。今后除制订采伐结束检查山场责任制度严格执行外，保证再不发生这种现象。
