	Sending a Sickle Across a Thousand Li
	Dīng Fán
	After days of scorching sun, the wheat was ripe. The fields were a golden expanse.
	In the wheat fields of the Guangming Cooperative in Anlu County, Zhang Desheng, a cadre from the county military service bureau, and Zhang Qiyao, the cooperative director, were harvesting busily. The weather was hot, and they harvested for a long time with their heads down, but when they straightened up, they had only harvested a small patch. Comrade Zhang Desheng thought, "At this rate, when will we finish harvesting!" At this moment, he suddenly remembered the shan sickle from his hometown—Anhui Province. Using a shan sickle to harvest wheat allows one person to harvest at least ten mu of land a day, which is four or five times faster than using the moon sickle here. So, he discussed it with the cooperative director and decided to imitate it.
	However, because they didn't have a model and couldn't remember it accurately, their trial production failed. What to do? He took out his savings of ten yuan, wrote a letter home, and asked his father to buy two good long iron sickles and send them, so he could install the handles and bamboo netting himself.
	Comrade Zhang Desheng's hometown is in Taihe County, Anhui Province, more than a thousand li away from Anlu County. His father, named Zhang Chuncai, was an agricultural cooperative member. After receiving his son's letter, he immediately bought two good long iron sickles, ready to send them immediately. However, he thought to himself, "Didn't my son say in his letter that he hadn't been able to install them successfully? If I send the sickles and he can't install them properly, wouldn't that delay the important work of the villagers over there! It's better to install them myself and send them, just to be sure." Thus, the old man traveled over a thousand li, bringing the two installed sickles to Anlu.
	The next day, a new harvesting tool appeared in the wheat fields of the Guangming Cooperative—the shan sickle. Comrade Zhang Desheng stood upright, holding the sickle handle in one hand and the tether rope in the other. The sickle danced through the wheat, cutting a patch with each sweep. Before long, a dou of wheat had been harvested.
	As the sickle flashed, a large group of people gathered around in the wheat fields, all praising, "Old Zhang, where did you get this treasure?" When the cooperative director explained where it came from, they quickly asked the old man, "Where is your father?" Comrade Zhang Desheng said, "He has a lot of work in his own cooperative, so he only stayed one night and went back early this morning." Everyone listened and blamed him, saying, "Why didn't you keep the old man for a few more days?!"

    千里送删镰
    丁凡
    经过几天烈日的曝晒，麦子已经成熟了。满田满野，都是金黄的一片。
    在安陆县光明社的麦田里，县兵役局下放干部张德胜和社主任张齐尧，正在紧张地收割。天气很热，他们闷着头割了好半天，伸起腰来一看，才只割了不多大一块。张德胜同志心想：“像这样割下去该要割到什么时候呀！”这时，他忽然想起了家乡——安徽省的删镰。用删镰割麦，一个人一天至少要割上十亩田，和这里用的月镰比较起来，效率要快四、五倍。于是，他就和社主任商量，决定仿制。
    但是，由于没有样子，自己又记不准，试制失败了。怎么办呢？他拿出了自己积存的十块钱，写了一封家信，托父亲在家里买两把长铁镰寄来，自己再安装镰柄和竹网。
    张德胜同志的家乡在安徽省太和县，离安陆县有上千里路。父亲名叫张春材，是一个农业社员。他接到儿子的信以后，马上买了两把上好的长铁镰，准备即刻寄去。但是，他转念一想：“儿子信上不是说自己装没有装成功吗？要是把删镰寄去他又装不好，岂不误了那边老乡们的大事！还是亲自装好了送去稳当些。”就这样，老人家就走了上千里路，把两把装好的删镰送到安陆来了。
    第二天，光明社的麦田里出现一种新的割麦工具——删镰。只见张德胜同志，直着身子，一手握住镰柄，一手带着牵绳，删镰在麦浪里挥舞，一镰下去割一片，不一会，一斗田的麦子就割光了。
    随着删镰的挥舞，麦田里围拢来一大群人，个个啧啧称赞道：“老张，哪里弄来的这个宝？”当社主任向大家说明了来历，他们就连忙问老张：“你父亲在哪里？”张德胜同志说：“他们社里活忙，他只住了一夜，今天一大早就回去了”。大家听了都埋怨他说：“怎么不把他老人家多留两天呢？！”
