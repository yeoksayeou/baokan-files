    Came at Just the Right Time!
    Shu Nan
    The Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the direction and support of its American masters, is actually clamoring to "counterattack the mainland," taking advantage of the opportunity of the American and British imperialist aggression in the Middle East. They have truly miscalculated.
    The Chinese people have never forgotten the liberation of Taiwan, have never forgotten driving the American invading troops out of our territory of Taiwan, and have never forgotten eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to "counterattack," he has come at just the right time.
    However, Chiang Kai-shek is a defeated general under the hands of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people are not afraid of this move of his. It is this small group of traitors who are panicking. Currently, a wave of panic buying of goods and hoarding of grain has swept through the Taiwan market, and prices are soaring day by day; moreover, for the sake of "safety," the families of Kuomintang bureaucrats are moving from Taipei to Tainan, while those living in Taichung are moving to Taipei; people are filled with fear and anxiety, and social order is becoming increasingly chaotic… causing the Chiang bandits to feel quite a headache about this chaotic situation.
    Relying on "millet and rifles," the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country wiped out millions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops equipped by American imperialism, driving Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters out of mainland China. Now, the Chinese people have armed forces that are many times stronger; if the Chiang Kai-shek clique still wants to continue to violate the Chinese people's desire for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and dares to invade, let them try!

    来得正好！
    舒楠
    蒋介石卖国集团在他的美国主子的指使和支持下，竟想趁美英帝国主义侵略中东之机叫嚣着“反攻大陆”。真是打错了算盘。
    中国人民一时一刻没有忘记解放台湾，没有忘记把美国侵略军从我国领土台湾赶出去，没有忘记消灭蒋介石卖国集团。蒋介石想来“反攻”，来得正好。
    然而，蒋介石是中国人民手下的败将，他这一手，中国人民是不怕的。惊慌失措的倒是这一小撮卖国分子。目前，台湾市场上卷起了抢购物资，囤集粮食的风浪，物价连日飞涨；还有，国民党官僚家属为了“安全”，住在台北的往台南搬，住在台中的却往台北搬；人心惶惶，社会秩序加倍混乱，……使得蒋匪帮对这种混乱局面也感到相当头痛了。
    中国人民解放军和全国人民，靠了“小米加步枪”，便把美帝国主义配备起来的几百万蒋介石军队消灭得干干净净，把蒋介石连同他的美国主子一起赶出了中国大陆。如今，中国人民有了强大了不知多少倍的武装力量；蒋介石集团如果仍要继续违背中国人民和平解放台湾的愿望，胆敢来侵扰，就试试看吧！
