Most Countries Oppose Intervention in the Middle East
British Journalist Discusses America's Isolated Position in the United Nations

London "Manchester Guardian" correspondent in New York, Cooke, reported from the United Nations that the United States is virtually isolated in the Security Council's discussions because everyone knows that the majority of the United Nations member states condemn the United States' armed intervention in Lebanon in different forms.

Cooke wrote, "This makes Lodge's (U.S. representative) recent attempt to obtain a majority in the United Nations General Assembly Special Session a faint hope."

The reporter wrote: "The United States is now in a panic, doubting whether it can obtain the support of forty-two countries, which is the minimum necessary majority in the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting. The Asian-African group will undoubtedly vote against it along with the Soviet Union's European allies. India firmly condemns the Marine landing, condemning all arguments and resolutions in favor of such action. The defection of Latin Americans is very unpleasant news." According to the reporter, the United States fears the consequences of its disregard for the United Nations.

    多数国家反对干涉中东
    英记者谈美在联合国处境孤立
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”驻纽约记者库克从联合国报道说，美国在安理会讨论的过程中实际上处于孤立地位，因为，人人知道，联合国的大多数会员国都以不同形式谴责美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉。
    库克写道，“这就使得洛奇（美国代表）最近企图在联合国大会特别会议上取得多数的希望渺茫了。”
    记者写道：“美国现在惊慌失措，怀疑自己是否能获得四十二个国家的支持，也就是在联合国大会紧急会议上取得最低限度的必要多数的支持。亚非国家集团无疑将同苏联的欧洲盟国一起投票反对。印度坚决谴责海军陆战队的登陆，谴责一切赞成这种行动的论点和决议。拉丁美洲人的临阵脱逃，是一件非常令人不愉快的消息。”据记者报道，美国害怕由于它蔑视联合国而遭到的后果。
