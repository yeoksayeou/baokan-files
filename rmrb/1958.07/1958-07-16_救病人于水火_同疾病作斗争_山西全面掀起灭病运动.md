Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th. Along with vigorously eliminating the four pests, Shanxi Province has launched a mass disease eradication campaign. Currently, Linfen, Yicheng, Anyi and other counties have eliminated malaria, tetanus of newborn infants, and kala-azar.

In the struggle to eliminate diseases, various places in Shanxi Province have changed the past practice of relying solely on experts and a few medical personnel, and boldly relied on the numerous health care organizations and the broad masses. In addition to the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee uniformly deploying and leading the work of hygiene and disease elimination, provinces, cities, and counties have also established disease prevention and treatment stations based on hospitals, maternal and child health stations, and regional hospitals in new-type market towns, as well as rural health stations established in townships and communes, dividing responsibilities for the prevention and treatment of diseases, so that state health agencies and the masses' own health organizations are combined. A large number of people in various places have been trained as key personnel for the investigation and prevention and treatment of kala-azar, malaria and other four diseases, and through the method of level-by-level teaching and training, disease prevention and treatment personnel have been popularized to townships and communes. Because Jishan County relied on health care organizations, it recently completed the county's disease investigation work while eliminating kala-azar, established health cards for all the people in the county, and established health record bags for each household.

The specific methods adopted in the disease eradication campaign are: combining the elimination of the four pests and paying attention to hygiene with disease eradication work, combining self-reporting of illness by the masses with doctor-guided treatment, and combining treatment with prevention. In prevention and treatment, health care personnel, in conjunction with the elimination of the four pests and hygiene work, visited every household to investigate and treat simultaneously; prevention and treatment progressed simultaneously. Therefore, the speed is fast and the effect is good. On the basis of achieving great achievements in eliminating the four pests, Linfen County mobilized the vast masses of the county and more than 400 medical personnel to invest in the struggle to eliminate kala-azar. They adopted a method of combining self-reporting by the masses, registration by health workers, midwives, and nursery workers, and doctor's examination to eliminate the disease, and generally investigated more than 258,000 people. If cases were discovered, they were treated free of charge; at the same time, 666 was sprayed on the patient's residence and the surrounding areas, basically eliminating the vector of kala-azar - sandflies and their breeding grounds. In the disease eradication campaign, many counties organized technical guidance groups to conduct diagnosis and investigation work, and moved the laboratory to the countryside. Now, residents suffering from goiter in various parts of Shanxi have generally consumed iodized salt. The struggle to eliminate neonatal tetanus in the province is also actively underway.

    救病人于水火　同疾病作斗争
    山西全面掀起灭病运动
    新华社太原15日电　山西省各地在大力除四害的同时，掀起了一个群众性的灭病运动。目前已有临汾、翼城、安邑等县消灭了疟疾、新生婴儿破伤风和黑热病。
    山西省各地在消灭疾病的斗争中，改变过去只依靠专家和少数医疗人员的作法，大胆依靠了星罗棋布的卫生保健组织和广大群众。省、市、县除了由爱国卫生运动委员会统一部署和领导讲卫生、消灭疾病的工作以外，各地并以医院、妇幼保健站和新型集镇的地区医院、乡乡社社建立的农村保健站为基础，分片建立了疾病防治站，分工负责预防和治疗疾病，使国家的卫生机关和群众自己的保健组织结合起来。各地大批地训练了黑热病、疟疾等四种疾病的调查防治骨干，并以逐级传授训练的方法，使疾病防治人员普及到乡、社。稷山县由于依靠了保健组织，最近在消灭黑热病的同时，完成了全县疾病调查工作，为全县人民建立了健康卡片，逐户建立了健康档案袋。
    灭病运动采用的具体办法是：除四害讲卫生与灭病工作相结合、群众有病自报和医生指导治疗相结合、治疗与预防相结合。在防治中，卫生医疗人员结合除四害讲卫生工作，挨门逐户，深入访问，边查边治；预防与治疗并进。因此速度快，效果好。临汾县在除四害取得巨大成就的基础上，动员全县广大群众和四百多个医务人员，投入了消灭黑热病的斗争。他们采取群众自报，保健员、接生员、保育员登记，医生检查三者相结合的办法进行灭病，并且普查了二十五万八千多人，发现病例就免费治疗；同时对患者住宅及四邻进行六六六喷洒，基本消灭了黑热病的传播媒介——白蛉子及其孳生场所。不少县在灭病运动中，组织了技术指导组，进行诊断和调查工作，并把化验室搬到农村。现在山西各地患甲状腺肿的居民，已普遍食用了碘化食盐。省内消灭新生儿四六风的斗争也在积极展开。
