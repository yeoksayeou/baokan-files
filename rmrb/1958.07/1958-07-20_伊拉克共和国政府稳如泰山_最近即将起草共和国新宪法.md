Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The government of the Republic of Iraq is increasingly consolidated, rock solid, and widely supported by the Iraqi people. The Iraqi government is continuously taking measures to consolidate and defend the Republic.

The Iraqi people warmly embrace and support the newly established government of the Republic. Streets in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, are plastered with slogans supporting the new Republic and portraits of the revolutionary leader Qasim. Iraqi people sending telegrams to express their support and congratulations on the birth of the Republic are lined up in long queues in front of various telegraph offices, sometimes up to fifty meters long. An official from the Iraqi Telegraph Bureau said that Iraqi telegraph bureaus processed more than 800,000 telegrams in the past four days, all of which supported the army's revolutionary actions. On the 18th, the Kurdish leader of Iraq, Ahmed Barzani, telegraphed Prime Minister Qasim, expressing his full support for the establishment of the Republic, which would bring happiness to the people, and stating that he was ready to support this action with manpower and resources. Tribal chiefs in southern Iraq also sent similar telegrams expressing their support for Qasim. It is reported that the former Iraqi Kingdom government's ambassador to Tehran also expressed his allegiance to the government of the Republic of Iraq.

Four European oil merchants traveling from Basra, Iraq, to Tehran said on the 18th that the newly established government of the Republic of Iraq had apparently taken complete control of the country and was rock solid. They said, "The current government will last." They also said that the new government is "understanding of foreigners."

The government of the Republic of Iraq has abolished the constitution of the Faisal dynasty and will soon establish a committee to draft a new constitution for the Republic of Iraq. Foreign Minister of the Republic, Abdul Jabbar Jomard, announced that the Republic has decided to allow all political exiles to return to Iraq. The Foreign Minister has sent telegrams to Iraqi embassies and consulates abroad, requesting them to assist all Iraqi people who want to return to Iraq. The government of the Republic has confiscated all the palaces of the Hashemite royal family, and these palaces will become state property.

The government of the Republic has ordered the closure of the Faisal dynasty's official newspaper, "The People's News," and published "The Masses News." The first issue of "The Masses News" has been published in Baghdad.

The Iraqi Army has canceled all leaves. The Iraqi Air Force performed an excellent air show over Baghdad on the 18th.
