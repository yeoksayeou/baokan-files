    Oil and Human Blood
    Chen Tao
    American newspaper editorial departments have received many letters from readers protesting American armed intervention in the Middle East. One reader wrote in the Washington "Star": "It seems that they value oil more than blood. We have no right to stem the rising tide of Arab nationalism..."
    The excuse for the American armed aggression against Lebanon is the so-called "protection of American nationals" and "defense of Lebanon's independence." Facts have proven that this notorious lie cannot even deceive its own people.
    In the eyes of imperialists, oil is indeed more valuable than human blood. For the sake of oil, and to enslave the people of all countries, they do not hesitate to make everyone bleed, including the blood of their own people. Because they are man-eating jackals, vampires, and professionals in eating human blood. While greedily sucking the blood of the people, they wipe their mouths and say: "I am a defender of peace!" How hateful, how abominable!
    "The needs of the American people and the people of all countries should be higher than the interests of certain oil companies investing in the Near East..." This is a letter to the "Star" written by a reader named Nelson. This is the voice of justice. In the eyes of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, human blood is more precious than oil, that goes without saying, but for independence and freedom, for truth and justice, they will stand up to resist aggression and not be afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice!

    石油和人血
    陈涛
    美国报纸编辑部收到许多抗议美国武装干涉中东的读者来信。一个读者在华盛顿“明星报”上写道：“似乎他们把石油看得比血还宝贵。我们没有权利遏止阿拉伯民族主义正在高涨的浪潮……”
    美国武装侵略黎巴嫩的借口是所谓“保护美国侨民”和“保卫黎巴嫩的独立”，事实证明，这个臭名远扬的谎言连本国人民也是骗不了的。
    在帝国主义的眼里，石油确比人血宝贵得多，他们为了石油，为了奴役各国人民，竟不惜叫大家流血，包括本国人民的血。因为他们是吃人的豺狼，是吸血鬼，是以吃人血为职业的。他们一方面贪婪地吮吸着人民的血，一方面却把嘴巴一抹说：“我是和平的保卫者”！这多么可恶，多么可恨！
    “美国人民和世界各国人民的需要，应该高于在近东进行投资的某些石油公司的利益……”这是一个叫纳尔逊的读者写给
  “明星报”的一封信。这是正义的声音。在中东人民和全世界人民看来，人血比石油宝贵，那是不用说的，但是为了独立和自由，为了真理和正义，他们要挺身而起反抗侵略，不怕流血牺牲！
