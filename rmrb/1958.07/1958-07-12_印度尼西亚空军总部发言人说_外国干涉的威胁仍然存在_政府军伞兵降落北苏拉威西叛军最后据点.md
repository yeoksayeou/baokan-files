Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, Suroto, head of the press office of the Indonesian Air Force Headquarters, told reporters on the 10th that the recent discovery of a "B-29" bomber over the Langara area in Central Sulawesi shows that the threat of foreign intervention still exists.

Suroto said that the plane probably dropped military equipment to the rebels hiding in the jungles of the Langara area.

When talking about the origin of the plane, he said that the U.S. Air Force currently possesses "B-29" bombers.

He also said that the Indonesian Air Force authorities have obtained some materials regarding the air force base from which the plane took off.

On the 11th, the Indonesian Air Force authorities announced that an unidentified B-26 bomber attacked an Indonesian Navy vessel in the waters near North Sulawesi on the 9th, causing no casualties.

Jakarta's "Eastern Star Daily" published an editorial on the 11th, saying that when observing the recent situation in Indonesia, one cannot ignore the cunning actions of foreign interventionists.

The "Eastern Star Daily" believes that it is worth noting that U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Riley and his assistant Rear Admiral Frey have arrived in Jakarta to enhance so-called understanding between the armed forces of the two countries.

The purpose of the United States is to show that the U.S. rulers have no understanding of Indonesia and to attempt to prevent the Indonesian people from suspecting that the recent bombings of Manado and Langara have anything to do with the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 10th: Radio Republik Indonesia broadcast on the evening of July 10th that government paratroopers had landed in Tondano, Tomohon, and Sarino, the last strongholds of the rebel group in North Sulawesi.

The broadcast also said that government troops who departed from Airmadidi on the 9th recovered Tanggali, only five kilometers from Tondano, on the 10th. Another government force cooperating in the operation is coordinating its advance towards Tondano.

    印度尼西亚空军总部发言人说
    外国干涉的威胁仍然存在
    政府军伞兵降落北苏拉威西叛军最后据点
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚空军总部新闻处负责人苏罗多10日对报界说，最近在中苏拉威西的浪加拉地区上空发现“B—29”型轰炸机这件事说明外国进行干涉的威胁仍然存在。
    苏罗多说，这架飞机大概是把军事装备投给了躲藏在浪加拉地区丛林中的叛军。
    他在谈到关于这架飞机的来源的问题时说，美国空军目前拥有“B—29”型轰炸机。
    他还说，印度尼西亚空军当局已经掌握了一些关于这架飞机从哪个空军基地起飞的问题的材料。
    印度尼西亚空军当局11日宣布，一架不明国籍的B—26型轰炸机9日在北苏拉威西附近海面袭击了一艘印度尼西亚海军的船只，没有造成伤亡。
    雅加达“东星报”11日发表社论说，在观察最近印度尼西亚的局势时，不能忽视外国干涉者的狡猾行动。
    “东星报”认为，值得注意的是，美国太平洋舰队司令赖利海军中将和他的助手弗莱海军少将已经到达雅加达来增进两国武装部队间的所谓谅解。
    美国的目的是要表明美国统治者心中对印度尼西亚并没有谅解，并企图使印度尼西亚人民不怀疑最近轰炸万鸦老和浪加拉的行动同美国有什么关系。
    据新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚共和国电台7月10日晚上广播，政府军伞兵部队已经在北苏拉威西叛乱集团的最后据点顿达诺、多莫洪和沙里诺降落。
    广播还说，9日从亚逸马帝帝出发的政府军在10日收复了距离顿达诺只有五公里的丹加利。还有另一路配合作战的政府军正在配合向顿达诺挺进。
