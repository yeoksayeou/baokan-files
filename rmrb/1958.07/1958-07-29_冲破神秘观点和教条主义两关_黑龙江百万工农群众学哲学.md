    Breaking Through the Barriers of Mysticism and Dogmatism
    Millions of Workers and Peasants in Heilongjiang Study Philosophy

    (Our newspaper reporter Han Zhifei reports) A magnificent mass movement of workers and peasants studying theory and Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical works has emerged in Heilongjiang Province. In less than a month, the number of participants has grown from political theory study groups composed of several dozen workers and peasants to nearly two million people. Among these masses, the majority are workers and peasants who have just shed the label of illiteracy.

    The first hurdle for the workers and peasants of Heilongjiang Province in starting to study theory and philosophy was to break the mystical views held by some people. Some workers at the Mudanjiang Cement Plant, having just emerged from illiteracy, had an urgent desire to study theory and philosophy. They thought, "If a worker hasn't even studied Mao Zedong's works, how can they manage the affairs of the state?" But some cadres felt, "The workers' level is low, how can they study philosophy and theory? They should study more culture!" Some workers still insisted on studying philosophy and theory. Some cadres still felt it wasn't quite appropriate, so they set a condition: only a small number of key personnel with a junior high school education would be allowed to study. As a result, those workers who were deemed unqualified to study philosophy and theory, regardless of the consequences, organized their own group to study Mao Zedong's philosophical works, and they studied very well. The Party Committee of the Cement Plant, seeing this situation, attached great importance to it, assigned special personnel to lead the group, and promoted it throughout the plant. In this way, 48.8% of the workers and their families in the plant quickly participated in the study of Mao Zedong's philosophical works. This vivid fact completely shattered the old view of considering philosophy and theory as something very mystical.

    Many workers and peasants reflected that after studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, they had solved practical problems in their struggles, felt particularly close to the material, and wanted to study more and more.

    In order to promote the experience of workers and peasants studying theory and philosophy, the Propaganda Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee held an on-site conference in the Mudanjiang area in mid-June, summarizing the experiences of workers and peasants studying theory and philosophy at the Mudanjiang Cement Plant and the Xin'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangnan Township, Ning'an County. Based on the high tide of workers and peasants studying theory and philosophy, it was decided to launch a mass movement of "reading books, newspapers, studying theory and philosophy" throughout the province. Liu Fengming, a worker at the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, wrote a poem about this: "According to the logic of mystery, how could workers enter a philosophy class? Thanks to the Party's General Line, which allows us to dare to speak and dare to act. Although our culture is shallow, we have experience in practical struggle. As long as our will is strong, the peak of philosophy is not insurmountable."

    The second hurdle for the workers and peasants in Heilongjiang Province in studying philosophy and theory is to break free from the shackles of dogmatism, truly achieve unity of theory and practice, learn and apply simultaneously, use theory to guide practice, and improve the level of theory in practice. Their method is "study what is needed, debate while learning, and act while learning." They don't get bogged down in the minutiae of terminology, but mainly grasp the essence of the documents. After studying Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the peasants of the Xin'an Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangnan Township, Ning'an County, further recognized the nature of the contradictions caused by the sabotage of two rich peasants in the cooperative. And they waged a serious struggle. The Harbin Pickled Vegetables Factory originally stipulated a set of rules for organizing cadres' theoretical study, including unified study content, unified study time, unified progress, unified lectures, and unified discussions. However, the workers said that these rules did not suit their learning characteristics. Therefore, the Party General Branch of the factory boldly broke these conventions and re-established them through mass discussion. As a result, they adopted lively methods such as selecting documents to read based on actual needs, setting their own pace, voluntary combination, and free conversation and debate, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of workers in learning philosophy, enabling 90% of the workers in the factory to participate in the philosophy groups and, on this basis, established a Marxist-Leninist night university.

    冲破神秘观点和教条主义两关
    黑龙江百万工农群众学哲学
    本报讯　记者韩之非报道：一个规模壮阔的工人、农民群众性的学习理论、学习毛泽东同志哲学著作的热潮，已在黑龙江省出现。在不到一个月的时间里，参加学习的群众，由几个数十名工人和农民组成的政治理论学习小组，发展到近二百万人。在这些群众中，大部分是刚摘掉文盲帽子的工人和农民。
    黑龙江省的工农群众开始学习理论、学习哲学的第一关，就是打破有些人的神秘观点。牡丹江水泥厂有些工人刚脱离文盲状态，就有学习理论、学习哲学的迫切要求，他们这样想：当一个工人，连毛泽东的著作都没有学过，那还能管理国家大事？可是有的干部们感到：工人水平低，那能学哲学、学理论呢，还是多学点文化吧！有些工人还是一心要学哲学、学理论。当时有的干部还是感觉不太妥当，于是就提出了一个条件，只让一部分具有初中文化水平的少数骨干学习，结果那些被认为不够学哲学、学理论条件的工人，不管三七二十一，自己就组织起了一个学习毛泽东哲学著作的小组，而且学习得很好。水泥厂的党委看到这个情况，非常重视，派了专人领导，并在厂里加以推广。这样，这个厂里很快地就有48.8％的工人和家属参加学习毛泽东哲学著作。这个活生生的事实，把过去那种把哲学、理论看得非常神秘的旧观点彻底打破了。
    许多工人和农民的反映是，学了毛主席哲学著作，解决了斗争中的实际问题，感到特别亲切，越学越想学。
    为了推广工农群众学理论学哲学的经验，中共黑龙江省委宣传部于6月中旬，在牡丹江地区召开了现场会议，对牡丹江水泥厂、宁安县江南乡新安农业生产合作社的工人和农民学理论、学哲学进行了总结。根据工农群众学理论、学哲学的高涨形势，决定在全省范围内开展一个群众性的“读书读报学理论学哲学”的运动。哈尔滨电机厂的工人刘凤鸣为这件事作了一首诗：“按神秘的逻辑来看，工人那能进哲学班。感谢党的总路线，叫我们敢说、敢干。我们虽然文化浅，但有实际斗争的经验，只要我们意志坚，哲学高峰并非高不可攀。”
    黑龙江省各地工农群众，学哲学、学理论的第二关，就是大破教条主义的束缚，真正做到学用一致、边学边用，用理论来指导实践，在实践当中提高理论水平。他们的作法是“需要啥，学习啥，边学习，边辩论，边行动”，在学习时不钻名词术语的牛角尖，主要领会文件的精神实质。宁安县江南乡新安农业社农民，学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告后，进一步从本质上认识到了本村两个富农破坏合作社的矛盾性质。并且作了严肃的斗争。哈尔滨酱菜厂原来在组织干部理论学习的时候，规定统一学习内容，统一学习时间，统一进度，统一讲课，统一座谈讨论等等一套制度。可是工人们说这些制度不适合他们学习的特点。于是，这个工厂的党总支就大胆地破除了这些陈规，重新由群众讨论制定。结果他们采取了结合实际需要选读文件，自订进度，自愿结合，自由交谈辩论等生动活泼的方式，大大提高了工人学习哲学的积极性，使全厂90％的工人都参加到哲学小组里学习，并在这个基础上成立了马列主义夜大学。
