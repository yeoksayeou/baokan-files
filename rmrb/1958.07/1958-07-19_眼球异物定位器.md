    Eye Foreign Body Locator
    Luo Bingxiang, Director of Ophthalmology at Guangzhou First Hospital, has recently created a simple eye foreign body locator.
    When iron filings enter the eyeball, it is difficult to accurately measure the position of the iron filings in the eyeball, which can easily affect the effectiveness of the surgery. During the Great Leap Forward, Luo Bingxiang used needles and copper rings to make a simple eye foreign body locator, placed it on the injured eye, and used X-rays to illuminate it from the front and side of the injured person, which can accurately measure the position of copper and iron filings.

    眼球异物定位器
    广州市第一医院眼科主任罗秉相最近创造了一种简便的眼球异物定位器。
    铁沙冲入眼球里，很难测准铁沙在眼球中的位置，因此容易影响动手术的效果。大跃进中，罗秉相利用大头针、铜圈制成简便的眼球异物定位器，把它放在伤眼上，用爱克斯光从伤者正面和侧面照，能准确地测出铜、铁沙的位置。
