According to the Southern Daily News: The Shaoguan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Guangdong Province recently convened a local fertilizer professional meeting for eight counties and cities, including Shixing and Nanxiong. The meeting selected nine methods for producing local fertilizer and decided to promote them immediately. The nine methods are: using ferrous sulfate solution and locally produced ammonia water to make ammonium sulfate; using ferrous sulfate and ash lye to make potassium sulfate; using raw salt solution and ash lye to make potassium chloride; using old wall mud, raw salt water, and ash lye to make nitre potash; using phosphate rock powder and sulfur to make phosphate fertilizer; using spoiled salted fish, sulfuric acid, raw salt, and six other materials to make salted fish fertilizer; using sewage, raw salt, sulfur, and weeds to make artificial urine; using human urine and gypsum to make ammonium sulfate solution; and using quicklime, raw salt, and sulfur to make calcium sulfide.

The fertilizer effect of these nine types of local fertilizer is relatively good, and the production method is simple. Farmers in Lechang County learned to use local methods to produce potassium sulfate and potassium chloride at the Lechang Chemical Factory in just two days.

    韶关专区推广九种土化肥制造法
    据南方日报讯　广东省韶关专署最近召开始兴、南雄等八个县市的土化肥专业会议，评选出九种制造土化肥的方法，并决定立即推广。这九种方法是：用青矾水和土制氨水制成硫酸铵；用青矾和草木灰汁制成硫酸钾；用生盐溶液和草木灰汁制成氯化钾；用老壁泥、生盐水、草木灰汁制成硝泥钾；用磷灰石粉和硫磺制成磷肥；用臭咸鱼、硫酸、生盐等六种材料制成咸鱼肥；用污水、生盐、硫磺、野草制成人造尿；用人尿、熟石膏制成硫酸铵液以及用生石灰、生盐、硫磺制成硫化石灰。
    这九种土化肥的肥效都比较好，制法也简单，乐昌县农民去乐昌化工厂学习用土办法制造硫酸钾和氯化钾，两天就学会了。
