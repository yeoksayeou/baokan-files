Khrushchev's Letter to de Gaulle

Mr. Prime Minister:

I have carefully read your reply of July 26 to my letter of July 23 concerning a summit conference within the framework of the Security Council, as well as the replies from Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Macmillan. I would like to point out first that your reply indicates that you are concerned about the tense situation caused by the military conflicts in Lebanon and Jordan.

It is quite clear that the most urgent measures must be taken to end this conflict. Now, more than ever, swift and decisive action is needed to ensure the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Jordan and to prevent the expansion of military conflicts. Time waits for no one. We have consistently maintained this position in the past and continue to do so. The issue concerning the Middle East remains very pressing, and therefore the Soviet government has always believed that a summit conference of heads of government should not be delayed.

The situation in this region is becoming increasingly acute. American troops continue to land in Lebanon, British troops continue to land in Jordan, the American Navy is concentrating in the Eastern Mediterranean, and American reinforcements are being airlifted from Europe to the Middle East, especially the Adana region of Turkey. In this regard, special attention should also be paid to the fact that extensive armed intervention in the internal affairs of Arab Eastern countries is being widely planned in Turkey itself. King Hussein of Jordan, who has lost the support of his own people and relies on the help of interventionists, dares to threaten the use of force and declare his intention to march on Baghdad. He is a docile tool in the hands of those Western countries conspiring against the people of Arab Eastern countries. It can now be seen that there is a clear trend to expand the area of aggression. The threat of military attack looms over the Republic of Iraq. Urgent measures must be taken to end foreign armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan and to restore peace in the region.

In order to resolve the pressing issue of stopping military conflicts in the Middle East as quickly as possible, the Soviet government agreed to Mr. Macmillan's proposal of July 22 for a summit conference of heads of government within the framework of the United Nations Security Council, because the Soviet government considered that the nature of the summit conference stipulated in this proposal could also provide the possibility for conducting not only formal joint consultations. Mr. Macmillan expressed his opinion on the method of discussing the Middle East issue by heads of government at a special meeting of the Security Council, saying: No resolutions should be put forward that have not been agreed upon in advance. The purpose of our joint work is to reach a fruitful agreement, not to determine differences by voting.

U.S. President Eisenhower supported this proposal by the British government. You also did not express opposition to this proposal in your letter of July 22. On the contrary, you affirmatively supported the principle of convening a meeting and expressed your willingness to participate in direct contact between the heads of government of major countries to discuss the Middle East issue.

In this regard, one fact is worth noting: As soon as the Soviet government expressed its agreement to Mr. Macmillan's proposal to convene a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of heads of government, the US and British governments, as can be seen from their recent letters, rushed to retreat from the already reached agreement on the rapid holding of a summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Britain, and India within the framework of the Security Council. The US and British governments have raised procedural issues again and are unwilling to step outside the formal confines of the Security Council's rules of procedure. The US government has deviated from its position of July 22 on immediately convening a special meeting of the Security Council with the participation of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Britain, and India, and has proposed that the Middle East situation, which endangers peace, should not be discussed by the heads of government of the five countries, but should be returned to the ordinary meeting of the Security Council for discussion. British Prime Minister Macmillan now also supports this proposal. But what will be the result of this? You are certainly aware that the Security Council has spent a long time discussing the situation in Lebanon and Jordan, but has not achieved any positive results, which you have correctly pointed out in your letter of July 26.

Today, the issue of stopping armed aggression against the Middle East is very acute, and judging from the experience of the recent meetings of the Security Council, it is powerless to make urgent and effective decisions on this issue. Troops are constantly gathering in this region, which is increasingly becoming a powder keg that could be ignited at any moment and could cause a world catastrophe. In this situation, a five-nation summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, must be convened immediately. Because they possess high authority and can reach agreements on immediately stopping armed conflicts in the Middle East and on measures to maintain and strengthen universal peace.

The Soviet government still believes that the heads of government of the major powers must meet immediately. Holding a summit conference according to the procedure we proposed on July 19 is an effective means of stopping armed conflicts in the Middle East. Therefore, we are pleased to learn from your letter that you think it is best to support the immediate convening of a five-nation summit conference of the heads of government with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General; this attitude, as we understand it, means that your government does not disagree with the Soviet Union's proposal on this issue.

It is quite clear that if we very sincerely hope to find a way to ease the tense situation, we should agree that, under the current circumstances, the five major powers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, the United States, and India should first reach an agreement on the necessary measures to maintain and consolidate peace. If these five major powers can reach an agreement on immediately stopping armed conflicts in the Middle East, who would doubt that any other country that is truly concerned about consolidating peace would welcome and support this decision?

The Soviet government adheres to its position of struggling to maintain and consolidate peace, and adheres to its position of peaceful coexistence among countries with different socio-economic systems. The Soviet government has always consistently advocated resolving all conflicts peacefully through negotiation. Therefore, we firmly advocate immediately stopping aggression and firmly advocate the speedy withdrawal of intervention troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

We are convinced that it is precisely a five-nation summit conference that, under the condition that all parties are sincere, will help to find ways and possibilities to eliminate military conflicts in the Middle East and stabilize the situation in the Middle East.

We on our part have already and will continue to do everything possible to resolve this issue in this way. This is obvious to every honest person who advocates maintaining peace and developing friendly cooperation between countries and peoples.

In view of the extremely tense situation that has been created in the Middle East, the Soviet government still believes that a summit conference of the heads government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, with the participation of the United Nations Secretary-General, must be convened immediately.

As for the location of the summit conference, we agree with your suggestion that the meeting should preferably be held in Europe, either in Geneva or in any other city in Europe.

The issue of holding a summit conference in a European city is particularly noteworthy because, according to some sources, holding a meeting of the heads of government in New York would cause difficulties for the US authorities in protecting the safety of the heads of government. We do not want to embarrass the US government on this issue. Therefore, the Soviet government, on the one hand, does not object to holding the meeting in New York as before, and also agrees to holding the meeting in Geneva, Paris, Vienna, or any other location acceptable to all participants.

We welcome reaching an agreement on holding a summit conference in Moscow. The Soviet government can guarantee the full safety of all delegations and provide the necessary conditions for effective work. We are convinced that the Soviet people will welcome the envoys who come here to take urgent measures to stop the conflict in the Middle East and consolidate universal peace, and the Soviet people will thereby demonstrate their unwavering loyalty to the cause of peace.

Now let's talk about the date of the summit conference. Unfortunately, you did not mention any date for holding this meeting in your letter. As everyone knows, we had suggested July 28, and are also willing to convene the meeting on any recent date, and hope to hear from you when France would be willing to participate in the five-nation summit conference.

Mr. Prime Minister, I would be grateful if you could reply as soon as possible.

                  With respects, N. Khrushchev
                        July 28, 1958
                            In Moscow

### 赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的信

1958-07-30
第3版()
专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫给戴高乐的信总理先生：
    我仔细地阅读了您7月26日答复我7月23日关于在安全理事会范围内召开政府首脑会议的信件的回信，以及艾森豪威尔先生和麦克米伦先生的回信。我首先想指出一点，您的回信表明，您对于在黎巴嫩和约旦的军事冲突所引起的紧张局势感到不安。
    十分明显，必须采取最紧急的措施来终止这一冲突。现在比过去任何时候都更加需要采取迅速而坚决的行动，以便保证外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦，并且使军事冲突地区不致扩大。时间是不等人的。我们过去和现在都一直坚持这种立场。有关中近东的问题现在仍然十分紧迫，因此苏联政府一直认为，不能拖延各国政府首脑会议。
    这一地区的局势日益尖锐化。美国军队继续在黎巴嫩登陆，英国军队也继续在约旦登陆，美国海军正在地中海东部集结，美国的增援部队在陆续从欧洲空运到中近东，特别是土耳其的亚达那地区。在这方面值得特别注意的还有：在土耳其本国最近也广泛策划武装干涉阿拉伯东方国家的内政。失去了本国人民支持而依靠干涉者的帮助的约旦国王侯赛因，竟敢用武力进行威胁，扬言要向巴格达进军。他是那些阴谋反阿拉伯东方各国人民的西方国家手中的驯顺的工具。现在可以看出有扩大侵略地区的明显趋势。军事进攻的威胁笼罩着伊拉克共和国。必须采取紧急措施来结束外国对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉并重建该地区的和平。
    为了最快地解决停止中近东军事冲突的迫切问题，苏联政府同意了麦克米伦先生7月22日关于在联合国安理会范围内举行政府首脑会议的建议，因为苏联政府考虑到，这个建议规定的政府首脑会议的性质，还能为进行不仅是正式的共同磋商提供可能。麦克米伦先生对政府首脑在安理会特别会议上讨论中近东问题的方法表示了意见，他说：不应当提出未经事先商妥的任何决议，我们共同工作的目的是要达成会有成果的协定，而不是通过表决确定分歧。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔先生支持了英国政府的这个建议。您在7月22日的信中也没有表示反对这个建议，相反的，您肯定地支持了召开会议的原则，并且表示愿意参加主要国家政府首脑之间的直接接触来讨论中近东问题。
    在这方面有一个事实值得注意：苏联政府刚一表示同意麦克米伦先生关于召开有政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议的建议，美英两国政府，从它们最近的来信中可以看出，赶忙从已经达成的关于在安理会范围内迅速举行苏、法、美、英和印度政府首脑会议的协议后退了。美英两国政府又提出了程序问题，不愿走出安理会议事规则的形式界线。美国政府背离了7月22日关于立即召开有苏、法、美、英和印度政府首脑参加的安理会特别会议的立场，并建议不由五国政府首脑讨论危害和平的中近东局势，而把这个问题重新交给安理会普通会议讨论。英国首相麦克米伦先生现在也支持这个建议。但是这会产生什么结果呢？您当然清楚地知道，安理会已经花很长时间讨论过了黎巴嫩和约旦的局势，但是没有得出任何积极成果，这一点您在7月26日的信中已经正确地指出了。
    今天，制止对中近东的武装侵略的问题十分尖锐，从安全理事会近来所举行的会议的经验看来，它无力就这个问题作出紧急的和有效的决定。军队在这个地区不断集结，这一地区愈益变成一触即发并可能引起世界灾难的火药库。在这种情况下，必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏、美、英、法、印度五国政府首脑会议。因为他们拥有高度的权力，能够就立即停止中近东地区武装冲突和就维护以及加强普遍和平的措施达成协议。
    苏联政府仍然认为，大国政府首脑必须立即会晤。按7月19日我们所提出的程序举行政府首脑会议是停止中近东武装冲突有效的手段，因此我们满意地从您的信中获悉，您认为最好是支持立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的五国政府首脑会议；这种态度，据我们所理解，是政府同苏联关于这个问题的建议没有分歧的。
    十分明显，如果我们非常真诚的希望找到缓和紧张局势的途径，我们就应该同意：在目前情况下，苏联、法国、英国、美国和印度这五大国首先应该就维护和巩固和平的必要措施达成协议。如果这五大国能够就立即停止中近东武装冲突这点达成协议，那么真正关心巩固和平的任何其他国家就会欢迎和支持这个决定，这点难道有谁会怀疑吗？
    苏联政府坚持为维护与巩固和平而斗争的立场，坚持社会经济制度不同的国家和平共处的立场。苏联政府始终不渝地主张通过谈判用和平的手段解决各种冲突。因此，我们坚决主张立即制止侵略，坚决主张干涉军火速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。
    我们深信，正是五国政府首脑会议，在各方都有诚意的条件下，会有助于找到消除中近东地区军事冲突的途径和可能，并安定中近东地区局势。
    我们这方面已经而且还要竭尽一切努力来这样解决这一问题。这是每一个主张维护和平和主张发展各国和各国人民之间友好合作的正直的人有目共睹的。
    鉴于在中近东地区已经造成了极端紧张的局势，苏联政府仍然认为，必须立即召开有联合国秘书长参加的苏联、美国、英国、法国和印度政府首脑会议。
    至于政府首脑会议的地点，我们同意您的建议，会议最好在欧洲，在日内瓦或者在欧洲任何其他一个城市举行。
    关于在欧洲某一城市举行政府首脑会议的问题之所以尤其值得注意是因为，从某些消息看来，各国政府首脑在纽约举行会议会给美国当局在保护各国政府首脑安全方面造成困难。我们不想在这个问题上使美国政府为难。因此，苏联政府一方面像从前一样，不反对在纽约召开会议，同时也同意在日内瓦、巴黎、维也纳或者能为所有参加者接受的任何其他地点召开会议。
    我们欢迎能就在莫斯科举行政府首脑会议这点达成协议，苏联政府可以保证各国代表团充分安全，并提供进行有效工作的必要条件。我们深信，苏联人民将会欢迎为了采取紧急措施以停止中近东冲突和巩固普遍和平而来到这里的使者，苏联人民将借此表明他们毫不动摇地忠实于和平事业。
    现在谈一谈政府首脑会议的日期问题。遗憾的是，您在信中没有谈到举行这次会议的任何日期。大家都知道，我们曾经建议在7月28日，也愿意在最近的任何日期召开会议，并希望从您那里知道，法国愿意在什么时候参加五国政府首脑会议。
    总理先生，如果您能尽可能快地回答，我将表示感谢。
                  此致敬意　尼·赫鲁晓夫
                        1958年7月28日
