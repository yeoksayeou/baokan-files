Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 18th: Representatives of Asian and African countries attending the Stockholm Conference held a meeting at noon today. They unanimously adopted a resolution on the Middle East situation, hailing the victory of the Iraqi revolution, expressing full support for the people of Iraq and Lebanon, and condemning the armed aggression of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Middle East.

The resolution stated that the landing of U.S. armed forces on Lebanese territory "is an unwarranted act of aggression against the Lebanese people. This action should be particularly condemned because it mocks the United Nations Charter and completely disregards the reports of the UN Secretary-General and his observers, who clearly stated that the recent events in Lebanon were entirely internal affairs."

The resolution said, "We hear with equal concern that British troops are landing in Jordan and that U.S., British, and French armed forces are massing heavily in the Middle East, with the apparent aim of destroying the newly born Republic of Iraq and suppressing the spontaneous uprising of the Arab peoples against aggressive military treaties and foreign military domination. We are convinced that all these acts of aggression and war are aimed at suppressing the national aspirations of the Arab peoples for independence, peace, and unity, and at maintaining and expanding imperialist interests in the region through military treaties and the Eisenhower Doctrine, which have been completely rejected by the freedom-loving Arab peoples." The resolution said, "New unjust imperialist adventures remind us of similar acts of aggression against Egypt and other Asian countries, which have pushed the world to the brink of war more than once."

The resolution pointed out, "The representatives of Asian and African countries declare that they hold the deepest sympathy for the people of Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan. We know that these unfortunate events in the Arab world are not isolated or unconnected events, but an integral part of a larger pattern of imperialist rule that has overshadowed the fate of the peoples of Asia and Africa for many centuries." The resolution emphasized, "Because of this, we deeply feel that we must unite as one against the plots of the imperialist aggressors, so that the misfortune of any member of the Asian-African family becomes the collective misfortune of us all."

The resolution concluded, "We call on the people of the world to unite in bringing pressure to bear on their governments to demand a halt to this blatant aggression against Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, and to urge the withdrawal of all foreign troops from all Arab countries. We remind the people of the world to be vigilant about the dangers posed to world peace and the very survival of mankind by these new acts of aggression by imperialist countries in the current world situation. We hail the heroic struggles of the people of Iraq and Lebanon to defend their national freedom. We pledge our full support for them and are confident that they will ultimately defeat the aggressors."

The representatives of the people of Asian and African countries attending the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation also adopted a resolution on the reunification of Vietnam, condemning the United States for interfering in South Vietnam, undermining the Geneva Accords, and keeping Vietnam divided. The resolution reaffirmed support for the efforts of the Vietnamese people to end U.S. interference in South Vietnam and to fully implement the Geneva Accords, and demanded an immediate end to foreign interference in South Vietnam, and demanded the speedy implementation of the Geneva Accords to achieve the cherished goal of peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

    斯德哥尔摩大会亚非国家代表一致表示
    不许美英干涉我们的中东兄弟
    新华社斯德哥尔摩18日电　出席斯德哥尔摩大会的亚非各国代表今天中午举行会议。一致通过了一项关于中东局势的决议，欢呼伊拉克革命的胜利，表示全力声援伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民，并且斥责美英两国对中东地区进行武装侵略。
    决议说，美国武装部队在黎巴嫩领土上登陆“是对黎巴嫩人民的一个无端侵略的行动。这个行动特别应该加以谴责，因为它嘲弄了联合国宪章并且完全无视联合国秘书长和他的观察员们的报告，他们明确地说，黎巴嫩最近的事件完全是内部事务。”
    决议说，“我们以同样不安的心情听到英国军队在约旦着陆和美英法三国武装部队在中东地区大量集结，其目的显然是要摧毁新诞生的伊拉克共和国和镇压阿拉伯各国人民反对侵略性军事条约和外国军事统治的自发起义。我们确信，所有这些侵略和战争措施的目的都是要镇压阿拉伯各国人民要求独立、和平和团结的民族愿望，要通过军事条约和艾森豪威尔主义维持和扩大帝国主义在这个地区的利益，这些军事条约和艾森豪威尔主义已经遭到爱好自由的阿拉伯各国人民的彻底唾弃。”决议说，“新的不义的帝国主义冒险行动使我们回想起了对于埃及和其他亚洲国家的类似的侵略行为，这种侵略曾经不止一次把世界推向战争的边缘。
    决议指出，“亚非国家的代表们宣告他们对黎巴嫩、伊拉克和约旦的人民抱着最深切的同情。我们知道，阿拉伯世界这些不幸的事件不是孤立的或者没有联系的事件，而是范围更大的帝国主义统治方式的不可分割的一个组成部分，这种帝国主义统治许多世纪以来一直笼罩着亚非各国人民的命运。”决议强调指出，“由于这一点，我们深深感觉到我们必须一致联合起来反对帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，使得亚非大家庭中任何一个成员的不幸成为我们大家集体的不幸。”
    决议最后说，“我们呼吁全世界人民一致地向他们的政府施加压力，要求停止这种对黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克的肆无忌惮的侵略，促使所有的外国军队撤出所有阿拉伯国家。我们提醒全世界人民警惕在目前的世界局势下的帝国主义国家这些新的侵略行为使世界和平和人类本身的生存所遭受到的危险。我们欢呼伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民为维护他们的民族自由所进行的英勇斗争。我们保证全力支持他们，并深信他们最后会战胜侵略者。”
    出席斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会的亚非各国人民的代表同时还通过了一项关于越南统一的决议，谴责美国在南越进行干涉，使日内瓦协定遭到破坏，使越南仍然处于分裂状态。决议重申支持越南人民为结束美国对南越的干涉和为充分履行日内瓦协议所做的努力，并要求立即停止外国对南越干涉，要求迅速履行日内瓦协定以实现人们珍视的和平统一越南的目标。
