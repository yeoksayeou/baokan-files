Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th: By 8:21 PM Moscow time on July 27th, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite will have orbited the Earth for its one-thousandth time.

During this period, the satellite's orbital period has shortened by 0.85 minutes, becoming 105.1 minutes, while the maximum altitude (apogee) has decreased from 1,880 kilometers to 1,800 kilometers. It should be noted that the orbital parameters of the first two artificial satellites changed more significantly during their first thousand orbits: the orbital period of the first satellite shortened by 3.5 minutes, while the orbital period of the second satellite shortened by 3.9 minutes. Their maximum altitudes decreased by 330 kilometers and 370 kilometers, respectively. The more rapid changes in the orbital parameters of the first two satellites are due to their smaller cross-sectional density.

The work of observing the third artificial satellite with optical and radio technology tools is continuing. To date, the adjustment calculation center has received and processed more than 38,000 radio measurement materials, 1,200 optical observation materials of the satellite, and more than 4,000 observation materials of the carrier rocket. Based on these materials, the precise orbital parameters of the satellite were determined in the early stages of its operation, as well as the nature of the changes in the parameters over time. Based on the obtained satellite orbital measurement data, the scientific observation results carried out on the third satellite can be accurately arranged according to geographical location.

Hundreds of radio stations around the world are receiving radio signals emitted by the "lighthouse" radio transmitter at 20.005 megahertz. The signal interpretation results show that the electricity used by the radio transmitter is supplied by solar cell arrays when the satellite is exposed to sunlight, and by chemical power sources when the satellite enters areas where sunlight is blocked by the Earth.

The brightness of the third artificial satellite is equivalent to a second to fifth magnitude star, while the carrier rocket is equivalent to a negative three to four magnitude star. When observing the carrier rocket, it is obvious that its brightness decreases drastically and periodically every seven to ten seconds, which is caused by the rocket rotating around its transverse axis.

Astronomical observatories in Orenburg, Dadu, Irkutsk, Sverdlovsk, Kiev, Tomsk, and other places have provided extremely valuable materials for observing the third satellite.

### 红色巨星运行千圈  轨道参数发生的变化比较小

    红色巨星运行千圈
    轨道参数发生的变化比较小
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到7月27日莫斯科时间二十点二十一分为止，苏联第三个人造卫星将围绕地球运行第一千圈。
    在这个时期内，卫星运行周期缩短了○·八五分钟，变成一○五·一分钟，而最大高度（远地点）从一千八百八十公里降低到一千八百公里。应当指出，头两个人造卫星的轨道参数在运行一千周时发生的变化比较大：第一个卫星运行周期缩短了三·五分，而第二个卫星运行周期缩短了三·九分。它们的最大高度分别降低了三百三十公里和三百七十公里。头两个卫星轨道参数变化比较迅速是因为它们的断面密度较小。
    用光学和无线电技术工具观测第三个人造卫星的工作正在继续进行。到目前为止，调整计算中心已经收到和整理了三万八千多份无线电测量材料，对卫星的一千二百次光学观测材料和对运载火箭的四千多次观测材料。根据这些材料，在卫星运行初期就确定了它的精确的轨道参数，确定了参数随时间而发生的变化的性质。根据已获得的卫星运行轨道测量材料，可以把第三个卫星上所进行的科学观测结果精确地按地理位置加以整理。
    全世界有几百个无线电台在接收“灯塔”无线电发射机以二○·○○五兆周发射出来的无线电讯号。讯号译解结果表明，无线电发射机的用电，在卫星受到太阳照射时是靠太阳能电池组供应的，在卫星进入太阳光被地球遮住的地区时则靠化学电源装置供应。
    第三个人造卫星的亮度相当二等星到五等星，而运载火箭相当负三到四等星。在观测运载火箭的时候可以明显地看出它的亮度每隔七一十秒钟周期性地剧烈减弱，这是由于火箭围绕自己的横向轴自转造成的。
    奥伦堡、达杜、伊尔库次克、斯维德洛夫斯克、基辅、托木斯克等天文观测站都提供了观测第三个卫星的极其珍贵的材料。
