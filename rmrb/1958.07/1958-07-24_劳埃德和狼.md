    Lloyd and the Wolf
    Dongfang Long
    When British Foreign Secretary Lloyd answered a reporter's question about the tensions caused by the Anglo-American intervention in the Middle East, he said: "I believe that everyone recognizes that the actions being taken are to maintain the stability, integrity, and independence of these small countries. I don't think the situation is a threat to world peace at all."
    The wolf wants to eat the lamb, so it claims to be there to protect them. Even a three-year-old can see this clearly. When the wolf appears on stage and deceives the lambs, the children will shout loudly, "It's a bad guy! Don't be fooled!" The lies of the British Foreign Secretary are so clumsy that they are not even more clever than the wolf in a children's play. But "everyone can recognize" that: first, Lloyd's shameless face, like Eisenhower's speech, is the logic of a pirate; second, deceiving the people to the point of reversing black and white and calling a deer a horse proves that these war criminals have reached the edge of desperation.

    劳埃德和狼
    东方龙
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在回答记者问他美英干涉中东所引起的紧张局势的时候说：“我认为，任何人都认识到正在采取的行动是为了维护这些小国的稳定、完整和独立而采取的行动。我认为局势根本不是对世界和平的一种威胁。”
    狼要吃小羊，就宣称自己是来保护它们的。这连三岁的小孩子都能看得清。当狼在舞台上出现并且骗小羊的时候，孩子们就会大声嚷起来：“它是个坏东西！不要上它当！”英国的外交大臣的谎话，居然拙劣到并未比儿童剧里的狼更高明些。但是“任何人都能认识到”：一，劳埃德的无耻的嘴脸同艾森豪威尔的演说同样是海盗的逻辑；二，欺骗人民竟然到了颠倒黑白、指鹿为马的地步，也足证这撮战争罪犯们已经到狗急跳墙的死亡的边缘了。
