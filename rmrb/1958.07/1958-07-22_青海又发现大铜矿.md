Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 20th July: A copper-bearing area of ​​500 square kilometers has been discovered in the Qilian Mountains of Qinghai. After geophysical prospecting, shallow wells, trenching, and detailed geological surveys within an area of ​​50 kilometers long and 10 kilometers wide, it has been confirmed that this is a silver-bearing pyrite-type copper mine, similar to the Baiyinchang mine, but several times larger.

Valuable ore bodies have been discovered in this mining area. High-copper chalcocite was discovered in the excavated shallow wells. At a depth of 25 meters in another well, fine-grained massive pyrite containing copper was found. At the same time, an ore body of 3,500 meters long, 100 meters wide, and an estimated depth of about 500 meters was also discovered. The surface of the ore body is covered with a large amount of emerald green malachite; golden chalcopyrite and blue azurite are exposed on the surface. The ore body grows in silicified limestone, and initial tests prove that the grade is very high.

This large copper mine, rare in the world, was found by the vanguard team of the Qilian Mountains Geological Team of the Qinghai Provincial Geological Bureau.

    青海又发现大铜矿
    据新华社西宁20日电  青海祁连山发现了一个五百平方公里的含铜矿地带。在长五十公里、宽十公里的范围内经过物探、浅井、槽探及地质细测工作，已证实这是一个属于白银厂式的含银黄铁矿型的铜矿。比白银厂要大数倍。
    在这个矿带内发现了很有价值的矿体。在挖掘的浅井中，发现了含铜很高的辉铜矿。在另一口井深二十五公尺的地方见到了含铜的细密块状黄铁矿。同时，还发现了一个长达三千五百公尺、宽一百公尺、估计深度五百公尺左右的矿体。矿体的地面上，遍布着大量的翠绿色孔雀石；金黄色黄铜矿和蓝色的蓝铜矿露出地表。矿体生长在矽化石灰岩里面，初测证明品位很高。
    这个世界上少见的大铜矿，是青海省地质局祁连山地质队的尖兵们找到的。
