Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, July 23rd: Rahman, head of the Jordanian delegation, and Mohieddin, a member of the United Arab Republic delegation, who are attending the Stockholm Conference, met with our agency's reporter and gave their views on the Middle East situation.

Rahman said that the landing of British troops in Jordan and the landing of American troops in Lebanon are acts of interference in the internal affairs of our two countries. These actions violate our sovereignty and independence and violate the United Nations Charter.

The Lebanese people, who are fighting against the current regime and against the Eisenhower Doctrine, will never allow the United States to interfere in their country, and they will certainly resist.

Rahman emphasized that the only way to resolve the current Middle East crisis is to withdraw US and British troops and for the imperialist governments not to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries.

Referring to the Arab national independence movement, Rahman said: "This movement is growing stronger and is joining hands with socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union and China. This movement is playing a decisive role in eliminating imperialism in the Middle East and thus in defending peace. The imperialists are very frightened by this new trend. They are afraid that the resources of the Middle East, especially oil, will no longer be theirs.

Rahman praised the Stockholm Conference for playing a very significant role in eliminating international tensions. He also said that we are very grateful for the warm feelings expressed to us by all members of the conference, especially the great feelings of solidarity expressed by the people of the socialist camp and the Asian and African countries. He said that we must pay tribute to the Chinese people, the Chinese government and the Chinese leader Mao Zedong in the name of our people and the Arab world, because they stand firmly with us against the imperialists.

Mohieddin, a member of the delegation of the United Arab Republic, said in his speech that the US aggression against Lebanon shows the people of all countries in the world what the Middle East military treaty means. This treaty means interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, controlling them, and using them as bases for aggression against other countries.

Mohieddin pointed out that the United States sent its troops to land in Lebanon, hoping to use Lebanon as a base for aggression against other Arab countries and suppression of the Arab national movement, but it is too late, and they are already in their twilight years. Now the power of the Arab people is stronger, and they have the support of the unity of the Arab people and the unity of the people of all countries in the world. The people of the United Arab Republic are ready to fight if a war of aggression breaks out.

The reporter asked him if he would like to say a few words to the Chinese people.

Mohieddin said: We heard Guo Moruo's speech. In his speech, he said that next year your annual steel output will exceed 20 million tons, which is not only a great victory for the Chinese people, but also a great victory for the people of all countries in the world. Every time China becomes stronger, this is a contribution to the peace movement. I wish the Chinese people success in building socialism and defending peace and freedom.

    约旦和阿联两国和平代表向我国记者表示
    解决中东危机唯有美英撤军
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩23日电　参加斯德哥尔摩大会的约旦代表团团长拉赫曼和阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团员毛希丁接见了本社记者，就中东局势发表了谈话。
    拉赫曼说，英国军队在约旦着陆以及美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆是干涉我们这两个国家的内政，这种作法侵犯了我们的主权和独立，违反了联合国宪章。
    正在为反对现政权、反对艾森豪威尔主义而斗争的黎巴嫩人民决不会允许美国干涉他们的国家，他们一定会抵抗。
    拉赫曼强调指出，解决目前中东危机的唯一办法是撤退美英军队，帝国主义政府不干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。
    谈到阿拉伯民族独立运动，拉赫曼说：“这个运动日益强大，正在同社会主义国家特别是同苏联和中国携手并进，这个运动在消灭中东帝国主义方面因而是在保卫和平方面起着决定性的作用。帝国主义者对这种新的趋势非常惊恐。他们害怕中东的资源、特别是石油将不再为他们所有。
    拉赫曼赞扬斯德哥尔摩大会在消除国际紧张局势方面起了非常显著的作用。他并且说，我们对所有大会的成员对我们表示的热烈感情；特别是社会主义阵营和亚非国家人民声援我们的伟大感情非常感激。他说，我们必须以我国人民和阿拉伯世界的名义向中国人民、中国政府和中国领袖毛泽东致敬，因为他们坚定地和我们站在一起来反对帝国主义者。
    阿拉伯联合共和国代表团团员毛希丁在谈话中说，美国对黎巴嫩的侵略向全世界各国人民表明中东军事条约意味着什么。这种条约意味着干涉其他国家内政，控制它们，利用它们作为侵略其他国家的基地。
    毛希丁指出，美国派遣它的部队在黎巴嫩登陆，是希望利用黎巴嫩作为侵略其他阿拉伯国家、镇压阿拉伯民族运动的一个基地，但是，这已经太晚了，他们已经处于日暮途穷的阶段。现在阿拉伯人民的力量是更强大了，他们有阿拉伯各国人民的团结和全世界各国人民的团结在支持他们。阿拉伯联合共和国人民准备战斗，如果侵略战争爆发的话。
    记者问他是否愿意对中国人民说几句话。
    毛希丁说：我们听到了郭沫若的演说，他在演说中说，明年你们钢的年产量就要超过两千万吨，这不仅是中国人民的一个伟大胜利，而且也是世界各国人民的一个伟大胜利。每当中国变得更强大的时候，这就是对和平运动的一个贡献。我向中国人民祝福，我祝他们在建设社会主义以及保卫和平与自由的事业中得到成功。
