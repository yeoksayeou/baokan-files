    Who Finds More Mines!
    Shigong
    Who finds more mines? Geological experts or the masses?
    At first glance, it's easy to think: of course, it's the experts. Mines are buried underground; how can they be found without experts? But in reality, that's not the case. If we check history and do the math, we'll find that the masses have found far more mines than experts.
    In our country, many famous mines have "existed since ancient times." Such as the Fushun Coal Mine, Daye Iron Mine, Dongchuan Copper Mine, Gejiu Tin Mine, Xikuangshan Antimony Mine, Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Mine... and so on. They were all discovered a long time ago, and some were mined extensively during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Although the names of those who discovered these mines are no longer known, it is certain that the discoverers were mostly ordinary working people. This is confirmed in the materials regarding the discovery of tungsten mines in southern Jiangxi: None of the tungsten mines in southern Jiangxi were discovered by experts. For example, the Dajishan Tungsten Mine was discovered by two salt peddlers from Guangdong. They accidentally found tungsten sand in a stream, and traced the stream until they discovered the mine. The Tieshanlong Tungsten Mine was discovered by a woodcutter named Hua, and several other sites were discovered by passing miners. Most were discovered by local farmers.
    Before liberation, the enthusiasm of the masses for finding mines was often suppressed and persecuted by the reactionary regime. The "Fengtian Mineral Resources Survey" preserves this passage: "The iron ore at this location (Xiajiahe) was discovered by a local (a derogatory term used by the exploiting classes for indigenous working people) named Wang Cheng in the first year of Tongzhi [1862]. In recent years, he has been mining and selling to the iron shops in Tianzifu Gou during his spare time from farming. By the twelfth and thirteenth years of Guangxu [1886-1887], the guarding minister of Yongling heard about it and issued a strict prohibition, after which no one mined it." The working people who discovered the famous Mohe Gold Mine in Heilongjiang suffered even more misfortune. After the gold mine had been opened up by the masses, the Qing government sent troops to slaughter and drive away the miners, seizing the gold mine.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the situation became even worse. Even the small mines that the people had already been mining themselves were forced to close down and become deserted due to the political and economic persecution by the reactionary regime.
    After liberation, the mass mining effort received the support of the Party and the government. In the past few years, the masses have provided information on more than 40,000 mineral locations. The Jingtieshan Iron Mine in western Gansu was first discovered by a Tibetan hunter. Other small mineral deposits discovered by the masses, such as crystal mines in certain areas of Guangdong and asbestos mines in Laiyuan, Hebei, are even more numerous. After the Party put forward the call for the whole people to run industry and geology, the mass mining effort has begun a great leap forward. On June 13th, the People's Daily published an article about Pinggu County, Hebei Province, organizing "native prospecting teams" to go up the mountains and mobilize the masses to find mines. They quickly found 146 mineral veins and immediately began mining and smelting. Seven years ago, geological workers had also investigated here, but did not find many mineral deposits at that time.
    The matter is very clear. Even if there are tens of thousands of experts (currently, there are fewer than 10,000 geological workers who have graduated from colleges and universities nationwide), if they are scattered across our country's vast territory of 9.6 million square kilometers, they will appear too few. Therefore, only by relying on the masses can we find more mineral resources. And only experts who are closely connected with the masses can make the greatest contribution to our mining effort. Ultimately, it is the masses who create history.

    谁找的矿多！
    石工
    谁找的矿多？是地质专家还是群众？
    乍一问，容易想到：当然是专家，矿埋在地下，没有专家怎能找到。其实不然，我们不妨查查历史，算算账，就会发现群众找到的矿远比专家找到的多得多。
    在我国，许多著名的矿山都是“古已有之”，像抚顺煤矿、大冶铁矿、东川铜矿、个旧锡矿、锡矿山锑矿、水口山铅锌矿……等等，都是早就被发现，有的在明清两代已大量开采了。虽然发现这些矿的人的姓名已不可考，但是可以肯定发现者多半是普通的劳动人民。这在关于赣南钨矿发现经过的材料中得到证实：江西南部有许多钨矿，这些钨矿，没有一个是专家发现的。像大吉山钨矿，是两个从广东来的挑盐小贩发现的。他们偶尔在溪中发现了钨砂，便沿着溪流追索，终于发现了矿山。铁山垅钨矿是一个姓华的樵夫发现的，还有几处也是过路的矿工发现的，更多的是当地农民发现的。
    在解放前，群众找矿的积极性经常受到反动政权的打击与迫害，在“奉天矿产调查书”中，还保存了这样一段话：“本处（下夹河）之铁矿系同治元年土人（剥削阶级对土著的劳动人民一种轻视的称呼）王成所发见，近来年年以农余之暇前往采掘，卖与田子付沟之铁铺，至光绪十二三年，为永陵守护大臣所闻，出示严禁，其后遂绝无人采掘。”发现著名的黑龙江漠河金矿的劳动人民，遭遇还要不幸一些。在金矿已被群众开采起来以后，清朝政府便派兵前往屠杀，赶走了采矿的人，把金矿霸占了。
    国民党反动统治时代，更是变本加厉，连人民原来已经自行开采的小矿，也因受不了反动政权在政治上、经济上的迫害，纷纷倒闭荒废了。
    解放后，群众找矿事业受到了党和政府的支持。几年来，群众提供的矿产情报地已有四万多处。甘肃西部的镜铁山铁矿，就是一个藏族猎人首先发现的。其他像广东某地的水晶矿、河北涞源的石棉矿等由群众发现的小型矿产地就更多了。在党提出全民办工业、全民办地质的号召后，群众找矿已开始了大跃进。6月13日人民日报刊载了河北平谷县组织“土勘探队”上山，发动群众找矿，很快就找到一百四十六条矿线，并且立即开采冶炼。七年前，也曾有地质工作人员在这里调查过，但当时并未发现多少矿产。
    事情很清楚，专家纵有成千上万（目前全国大专院校毕业的地质工作人员还不到万人），但是如果把他们分散在我国九百六十万平方公里辽阔的国土上，也就显得太稀少了，因此只有依靠群众，才能找到更多的矿产。也只有与群众密切联系的专家，才能对我们的找矿事业作出最大贡献，创造历史的归根到底还是群众。
