The kelp harvest in coastal provinces has essentially concluded. This year, China's artificially cultivated kelp saw a bumper harvest, with production increasing threefold compared to last year.

This year marks the first year of large-scale artificial kelp cultivation in our country. More than one hundred kelp cultivation sites in the seven coastal provinces from north to south – Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong – have mostly achieved bumper harvests, with a total output exceeding 40,000 tons. The yield per mu generally ranges from four to eight tons, with the highest reaching twelve tons per mu. In the past, people believed that kelp could not grow at all in high-water temperature areas such as Fujian and Guangdong, but they have also achieved good harvests. This year, the yield per mu of densely planted kelp in Fujian reached as high as eight tons.

In the past, some people believed that kelp cultivation technology was complex, difficult for the masses to master, and difficult to develop on a large scale. This year, the kelp cultivated by more than forty fishery (agricultural) cooperatives in coastal areas has a yield no less than that of state-run cultivation farms. The masses not only quickly mastered the cultivation techniques, but some cooperatives also created indigenous cultivation methods, making full use of substitutes to reduce costs. In Changshan Township, Changle County, Fujian Province, the masses used gourds and jars instead of bamboo rafts, and used locally produced oil grass and rice straw instead of brown ropes, reducing costs by half compared to state-run cultivation farms.

### 海带丰收

    海带丰收
    沿海各省收获海带基本结束。今年我国人工养殖海带丰收，比去年增产了三倍。
    今年是我国大面积人工养殖海带的第一年，从北到南的辽宁、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东沿海七个省养殖海带的一百多处大都丰收，总产量达到了四万吨以上。亩产一般在四吨到八吨之间，最高的亩产达十二吨。过去人们认为根本不能生长海带的福建、广东等高水温地区，也得到了很好的收成。福建今年密植的海带亩产量高达八吨。
    过去有些人认为养殖海带的技术复杂，群众难以掌握，大规模发展有困难。今年沿海四十多个渔（农）业合作社养殖的海带，产量也不亚于国营养殖场。群众不仅很快掌握了养殖技术，有些合作社还创造了土养殖方法，充分利用代用品降低成本。福建省长乐县长山乡群众用葫芦、坛子代替竹筏，用当地出产的油草、稻草代替棕绳，使成本比国营养殖场降低了一半。
