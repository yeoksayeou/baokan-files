Xinhua News Agency, July 13th, report by Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhu Bin: Based on the principle of work-study programs, the universities and colleges in the capital have gradually explored a concrete form of implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, which is for schools to vigorously establish factories.

Now, several new factories are born in the capital's universities and colleges every day. Peking University has built twenty factories in two weeks, and Beijing Normal University has built twenty-four factories in three days. Not only are some engineering colleges building factories, but also colleges of social sciences, liberal arts, medicine, and agriculture are building factories. According to incomplete statistics, to date, the various schools have put more than 200 factories into production. The vast majority of these factories have been built by the schools according to their specialties and existing technical conditions, in the spirit of doing whatever they can. It has the following significant characteristics:

First, emphasis on large, medium, and small scale. There are relatively well-equipped machine factories and precision machine factories that produce watches and cameras, etc., which have been expanded on the basis of the original laboratories or internship factories, as well as mining machinery factories that can produce various mining machinery. There are also chemical fertilizer factories and teaching equipment factories that started from scratch, using old sheds as factory buildings and operating entirely by hand, and electrode factories that produce in the open air. Second, emphasis on indigenous and foreign methods. There are small blast furnaces and synthetic petroleum factories built by learning the indigenous methods of farmers, as well as iron and steel complexes under construction that can produce 100,000 tons of steel per year and smelt various alloy steels, and oil refineries that produce 3,500 tons of synthetic petroleum per year. Third, emphasis on both popularization and improvement. There are mineral radio factories, farm implement repair factories, and automobile and tractor repair factories suitable for young students lacking production experience to popularize technology, as well as a number of new factories with higher technical levels or combined with the development of cutting-edge science and technology. Fourth, emphasis on comprehensive and specialized. Tsinghua University concentrates its main efforts on preparing to build a medium-sized comprehensive machinery factory, while each department and teaching and research group is also running factories in combination with their own specialties according to their remaining strength. After the comprehensive machinery factory is built, it can produce various machine tools, and rely on it to help each department run more specialized factories.

The construction funds and equipment used by these factories are mostly self-raised by the schools, and only a few key and cutting-edge technologies are invested in by the state. The Laborer Semiconductor Factory of Peking University was built by the teachers and students of the semiconductor major of the physics department of this school with the remuneration obtained from participating in physical labor on nearby construction sites. Tsinghua University sent people to help a machinery factory in Beijing design a large-scale new factory, thereby exchanging it for dozens of lathes. They also helped Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua solve some technical problems, and exchanged pig iron from this mine.

Although these factories have been established for a short time, they have greatly promoted the thinking of teachers and students, the quality of teaching, and scientific research work in various schools. Many teachers and students who insist on being both red and expert have quickly made achievements here. Many people who have long been accustomed to theory divorced from practice have encountered many setbacks in production practice. After the education of facts, they have a further understanding of their weaknesses. After vigorously running factories, universities and colleges have also added rich content to scientific research and opened up avenues for mass scientific research. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University has completed more research topics in more than three months of production activities than the total research topics completed in the past three years, and six achievements have reached the international level. The use of ductile iron to manufacture light rails is an international first. (Attached picture)

    向教育结合劳动的道路猛进
    首都高等学校天天出现新工厂
    特点是：大中小并举，土洋并举，普及提高并举，综合专业并举
    据新华社13日讯　新华社记者朱彬报道：首都各高等学校在勤工俭学的基础上，已逐步摸索到一条贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合方针的具体形式，这就是学校大办工厂。
    现在，首都高等学校里每天都有好多个工厂诞生。北京大学在两周内建成二十个工厂，北京师范学院在三天中间建成了二十四个工厂。不仅一些工科院校在建工厂，社会科学、文科、医科、农科等院校也在建工厂。据不完全统计，到目前为止，各校仅投入生产的工厂已有二百多个。这些工厂绝大多数是各校根据专业和现有的技术条件按照能办什么就办什么的精神建成的。它具有以下几个显著的特点：
    第一，大中小型并举，有在原先实验室或实习工厂的基础上扩充起来的设备比较齐全的机械工厂和手表、照相机等精密机器厂，以及能生产各种采矿机械的矿山机器厂等。也有白手起家利用旧工棚作厂房完全手工操作的化肥厂、教学用具厂，在露天下进行生产的电焊条工厂。第二，土洋并举，有学习农民的土办法建立起来的小高炉、人造石油工厂，也有正在建设的年产十万吨钢并且可以冶炼各种合金钢的钢铁联合企业和年产三千五百吨人造石油的炼油厂。第三，普及与提高并举，有适合缺乏生产经验的青年学生用来普及技术而办起的矿石收音机工厂、农具修理厂、汽车和拖拉机修理厂，也有技术水平较高，或者结合开展尖端科学技术而办的若干新型工厂等。第四，综合与专业并举，清华大学全校集中主要力量在筹办一个中型的综合机械工厂，而各系各教研组按照自己的余力又在办和自己专业相结合的工厂，综合机械工厂建成后，可以生产各种机床，依靠它又可以帮助各系举办更多的专业工厂。
    这些工厂所用的建厂资金、设备，绝大多数都是各校自筹的，只少数重点和尖端技术科学是由国家投资建设的。北京大学劳动者半导体工厂，就是由这个学校的物理系半导体专业的师生在附近工地上参加体力劳动取得的报酬办成的。清华大学派人帮助北京市的一个机械厂设计一座规模较大的新工厂，从而换得了几十台车床。他们还帮助宣化的龙烟铁矿解决一些技术问题，从这个矿换得生铁。
    这些工厂办成的时间虽短，但已对各校的师生的思想、教学质量、科学研究工作起了很大的促进作用。许多坚持又红又专的师生在这里迅速地做出了成绩，不少长期习惯于理论脱离实际的人在生产实践中碰了不少钉子，经过事实的教育，他们对于自己的弱点也有了进一步的认识。大办工厂以后，各高等学校在科学研究上也增添了丰富的内容，并为群众性的科学研究开辟了道路。清华大学机械系在三个多月的生产活动中所完成的研究题目比过去三年所完成的研究题目的总和还要多，而且已有六项成果达到了国际水平。用球墨铸铁来制造轻型铁轨，就是国际上的一项首创。（附图片）
