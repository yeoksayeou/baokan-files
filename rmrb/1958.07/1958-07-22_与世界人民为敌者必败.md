Those Who Make Themselves Enemies of the World's People Are Bound to Fail

After the United States and Britain dispatched invading troops into Lebanon and Jordan, they immediately discovered that they were trapped in a quagmire of unprecedented isolation, making themselves enemies of the world's people. The cries of "American troops get out of Lebanon!" "British troops get out of Jordan!" "No threats to Iraq!" "Oppose imperialist aggression!" "Oppose imperialist interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries!" resounded throughout the world. The people of Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan, who opposed aggression, received the universal sympathy and support of the world's people, especially socialist countries and the people of Asia and Africa.

On the 19th, the Soviet government proposed to the United States, Britain, France, and India to immediately convene a summit meeting of these countries in Geneva, with the participation of the UN Secretary-General, in order to take immediate measures to stop the military conflict that has already begun in the Middle East. This is another powerful measure by the Soviet Union to support the just struggle of the Middle Eastern people and to stop the piratical acts of the United States and Britain. This proposal has been warmly welcomed by all peace-loving countries and peoples. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has replied to Khrushchev, expressing his full agreement with the Soviet proposal; Swedish Prime Minister Erlander stated that "this is a proposal that should not be rejected"; Switzerland is ready to welcome such a meeting on its territory at any time. Obviously, the Soviet proposal reflects the common desire of all just humanity. Rejecting this proposal can only plunge the American and British aggressors into extreme isolation.

The matter is very clear: justice is on the side of the people of the Middle East. All the sweet talk of the imperialists is completely useless. Britain is an old-brand aggressor against the majority of Asian and African countries, and people will certainly not have any "misunderstandings" about it. Even the most cunning United States, which has long pretended not to be a colonialist and even "opposed" colonialism, has been completely exposed this time. The United States is today the foremost and most ferocious colonialist in the world, the number one public enemy of the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. After the American military's aggression against Lebanon, this has become an ironclad case, which can no longer be denied.

The armed intervention by the United States and Britain cannot suppress the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people, but rather deepens the opposition between the United States and Britain and the entire Middle Eastern people, and strengthens the national independence movement of the Middle Eastern people. The fighting spirit of the Middle Eastern people is even higher. The government of the Republic of Iraq, which has already seized national power, is taking various internal and external policies to guard against aggression and consolidate independence. It has recalled the troops formerly stationed in Jordan, it has established people's resistance forces as a backing for the regular army; it has been recognized by China, the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, Yemen, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Indonesia, Yugoslavia and other countries, and it immediately recognized the United Arab Republic and our country, and decided to quickly restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union; now it has signed a joint defense agreement with the United Arab Republic. Agence France-Presse's correspondent in Baghdad reported that the Iraqi "people are showing great enthusiasm and support for the revolution, which seems to be entirely an internal affair," and that "the republic now seems to be consolidated." The Associated Press correspondent in Washington also acknowledged that the revolutionaries in Iraq have "established firm control. Every day their control becomes firmer, therefore, it is even more difficult to overthrow them." Leaders of the opposition parties and the Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon have sent telegrams to the United Nations and the United States government respectively, protesting against the American military aggression. The President of the United Arab Republic has repeatedly warned the imperialists that aggression against Iraq is aggression against the United Arab Republic, and that the United Arab Republic will fulfill its joint defense treaty and will take up arms to defend the independence and freedom of the Arab nation. Saudi Arabia has also announced that it will not allow American aircraft to fly over its territory.

The struggle of the Middle Eastern people has received the enthusiastic support of socialist countries. In socialist countries, people have held meetings and demonstrations to protest against the aggression by the United States and Britain, and have guaranteed to provide the Middle Eastern people with various forms of assistance. At the same time, the proletarian parties of the world have unanimously condemned the interventionist actions of the imperialists.

The aggression by the United States and Britain is not only opposed by the working people of all countries, but also lacks support among the ruling classes in many capitalist countries. Within the United Nations, which is controlled by the United States, and within the North Atlantic Group, those who originally followed the orders of the United States are either "worried" or "concerned" about the consequences of the American and British aggression in the Middle East this time. At the emergency meeting of the Security Council, not only did the Soviet and United Arab Republic representatives thoroughly criticize the aggression by the United States and Britain, but the Swedish representative also stated that the actions of the United States were not in accordance with the UN Charter. The Swedish representative proposed to temporarily suspend the activities of the UN observers in Lebanon. This proposal was not in line with the intentions of the United States, because the American representative proposed to establish a "UN police force" to be sent to Lebanon, attempting to steal the banner of the United Nations and legitimize the act of invading Lebanon. At the Security Council, even the Japanese representative had to express "regret" over the United States' dispatch of troops to Lebanon, and dared not openly and unreservedly support the position of the United States. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, Greece, Italy, West Germany, and especially the Scandinavian countries, expressed "concern" about the consequences of the actions of the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan. The "Worker's Daily," the organ of the ruling Labor Party in Norway, reported from Paris that "there are differences among the fifteen member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the Middle East issue." This division in Western countries has further widened after Khrushchev issued the proposal to immediately convene a five-nation summit meeting. In West Germany, Italy, France, Greece, Denmark, Norway and other member states of the North Atlantic Group, the atmosphere of opposition to the military adventures of the United States and Britain in the Middle East is growing stronger.

Among the bourgeoisie in the United States and Britain, the situation of the aggressors is also very unfavorable. According to reports from UPI and AP, "In the United States Congress, members generally show a heavy and fearful appearance." In Washington, there has rarely been such an "atmosphere of uncertainty about the future" as there is now. Democratic Senator Humphrey criticized the government, saying, "We have imitated the approach of the British and French, which has already failed in the Arab world," and that this intervention "will actually destroy our position in Asia, Africa, and Latin America." Democratic Senator Kennedy said that at the closed-door meetings of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, senators had a certain "general feeling" that the American intervention was an "unwise action." Democratic Senator Fulbright publicly criticized the United States government for becoming "a victim of its own propaganda." Humphrey advocated that the US Secretary of State, Vice President, or even the President negotiate with Nasser. In the British House of Commons, there were 251 votes (to 314 votes) against sending troops to Jordan. Labor Party spokesman Bevan warned the government that following the example of the United States would lead Britain "down a path of endless destruction." After the Soviet Union proposed convening a five-nation summit meeting, British Labor Party leaders Gaitskell and Bevan demanded that the government immediately accept the Soviet proposal. All this shows that serious differences have arisen within the ruling groups of the United States and Britain on the Middle East issue. Eisenhower and Macmillan's policies toward the Middle East have not even won the full support of the ruling groups in the United States and Britain.

The American and British bourgeois media also have a number of sharp criticisms of this adventurous aggression. The "New York Post" said that the American intervention in Lebanon was a "tragedy" because it risked so much and was trapped in such a deep quagmire. The British "Daily Mirror" published an editorial entitled "Blind, Blind, Blind," saying: "The Suez Canal incident will go down in history as a mistake, but the British landing in Jordan contains even more serious dangers." The "Daily Herald" said that entering the Middle East, "no one knows what the result will be. We are entering the dark."

The aggressors, who have rushed into a quagmire where they are surrounded by enemies, are now in a difficult position to advance or retreat. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense admitted at a press conference on the 18th that the situation in the Middle East was "very tricky." Eisenhower told the American troops invading Lebanon on the 19th: "For all of you, this will be a difficult period." But until now, the American and British aggressors have not changed their plans for aggression. They are still continuing to gather forces, preparing to expand the aggression, and still insisting on making themselves enemies of the people of the world. It is clear that the American and British aggressors will inevitably sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire they have created for themselves. If the American and British aggressors stubbornly refuse to turn back, then, without a doubt, no matter how they bare their fangs and claws, the Middle East will inevitably become the graveyard of this group of aggressors!

    与世界人民为敌者必败
    美国英国派遣侵略军进入黎巴嫩和约旦以后，立即发现它们是陷在与世界人民为敌的、空前孤立的泥坑里。“美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国军队从约旦滚出去！”“不准威胁伊拉克！”“反对帝国主义侵略！”“反对帝国主义干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政！”的呼声，响遍了世界各地。反对侵略的黎巴嫩、伊拉克、约旦等中东各国人民，受到了世界人民首先是社会主义国家和亚非人民的普遍同情和支持。
    19日苏联政府向美英法印建议立即在日内瓦召开有联合国秘书长参加的这些国家的首脑会议，以便马上采取措施，停止中近东已经开始的军事冲突，这是苏联支持中东人民的正义斗争和制止美英海盗行为的又一个有力的措施。这个建议受到了所有爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎。印度总理尼赫鲁已复信赫鲁晓夫，表示完全同意苏联的建议；瑞典首相埃兰德表示“这是一个不应该加以拒绝的主张”；瑞士准备随时欢迎在它的境内举行这样的会议。显然，苏联的建议是反映了全世界正义人类的共同愿望，拒绝这个建议，只能使美英侵略者陷于极端的孤立。
    事情很明显，正义在中东人民这一边。帝国主义者的一切花言巧语完全无济于事。英国对于亚非多数国家是老牌的侵略者，人们固然不会对它发生什么“误会”；就是素来最狡猾的、长期间伪装不是殖民主义者而且“反对”殖民主义者的美国，在这一次也原形毕露。美国是今天世界上首要的和最凶恶的殖民主义者，是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动的头号公敌，经过美军对于黎巴嫩的侵略，这已经成为铁案，再也狡赖不脱了。
    美英的武装干涉不能镇压中东人民的民族独立运动，反而加深了美英与整个中东人民对立的局面，加强了中东人民的民族独立运动。中东人民的斗志更加高昂。已经掌握全国政权的伊拉克共和国政府，正在采取种种防备侵略和巩固独立的内外政策。它召回了从前驻在约旦的部队，它成立了作为正规军后盾的人民抵抗部队；它得到中国、苏联、阿联、也门、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、印度尼西亚、南斯拉夫等国家的承认，自己也立即承认了阿拉伯联合共和国和我国，并且决定迅速和苏联恢复邦交；现在它又和阿联签订了共同防御协定。法新社驻巴格达记者报道，伊拉克“人民表现得很热情并且支持革命，这次革命看来完全是内政”，“共和国现在看来已经巩固”。美联社驻华盛顿记者也承认，伊拉克的革命分子因为“他们已经掌握了坚定的控制权。每过一天，他们的控制权就更加坚定，因此，要想把他们赶下台就更难了。”黎巴嫩的反对党派领袖和议会议长分别致电联合国和美国政府，抗议美国的军事侵略。阿拉伯联合共和国总统一再警告帝国主义：侵略伊拉克就是侵略阿联，阿联将履行联合防御条约，将拿起武器来保卫阿拉伯民族的独立自由。沙特阿拉伯也宣布不让美机飞过它的领空。
    中东人民的斗争得到了社会主义国家的热烈支持。在社会主义各国，人民纷纷集会和游行示威，抗议美英的侵略，并且保证给中东人民以各种援助。同时，全世界的无产阶级政党都一致谴责帝国主义的干涉行动。
    美英的侵略不但受到各国劳动人民的反对，而且在很多资本主义国家的统治阶级中也得不到支持。在美国所控制的联合国内、在北大西洋集团内，原先唯美国的命令是从的人们，对于美英这次侵略中东的行动，不是“忧心忡忡”，就是“顾虑重重”。在安理会紧急会议上，不但苏联代表和阿联代表把美英的侵略行为抨击得体无完肤，而且瑞典代表也表示美国的行为不符合联合国宪章。瑞典代表提议暂时停止联合国观察员在黎巴嫩的活动，这个提案是不合美国的心意的，因为美国代表提议成立一支派往黎巴嫩的“联合国警察部队”，企图盗用联合国的旗帜，使侵黎的行动合法化。在安理会上，连日本代表也不得不对美国出兵黎巴嫩表示“遗憾”，而不敢公然无保留地支持美国的立场。在北大西洋集团理事会上、希腊、意大利、西德，特别是斯堪的纳维亚国家，对于美英在黎巴嫩和约旦的行动后果表示“忧虑”。挪威执政工党的机关报“工人日报”自巴黎报道，“北大西洋公约组织十五个成员国在中东问题上存在着分歧。”西方国家的这种分歧，在赫鲁晓夫发出立即召开五国首脑会议的建议以后，更加扩大了。在西德、意大利、法国、希腊、丹麦、挪威等北大西洋集团成员国，反对美英在中东的军事冒险的空气越来越浓厚。
    在美英本国的资产阶级中，侵略者的处境也很不妙。据合众国际社和美联社的消息，“在美国国会里，议员们普遍显出沉重和恐惧的样子”，在华盛顿过去很少有像现在这样存在一种“前途莫测的气氛”。民主党参议员汉弗莱抨击政府说：“我们仿效了英法两国早已在阿拉伯世界失败了的一套作法”，这种干涉“实际上会摧毁我们在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的地位。”民主党参议员肯尼迪说，在两院外交委员会举行的秘密会议上，参议员们有某种“总的感觉”，那就是美国的干涉是“不明智的行动”。民主党参议员富布赖特公开批评美国政府成了“自己的宣传的牺牲品”。汉弗莱主张，由美国国务卿、副总统，或者甚至总统同纳赛尔进行谈判。在英国下院，有二百五十一票（对三百十四票）反对出兵约旦。工党发言人比万警告政府说，追随美国的榜样，将使英国“踏上没有尽头的毁灭的道路。”在苏联关于召开五国首脑会议的建议提出以后，英国工党领袖盖次克尔和比万要求政府立即接受苏联建议。这一切说明，美英统治集团内部在中东问题上发生了严重的分歧。艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦对中东的政策甚至没有获得美英统治集团内部的完全支持。
    美英资产阶级的舆论界，对于这次侵略的冒险也有不少尖锐的指责。“纽约邮报”说，美国干涉黎巴嫩是一场“悲剧”，因为它冒着这样大的危险，陷在这样深的泥沼中。英国“每日镜报”以“盲目、盲目、盲目”为题发表社论说：“苏伊士运河事件将作为一个错误载入史册，但是英国在约旦的登陆包含着甚至更加严重的危险”。“每日先驱报”说，进入中东，“谁也不知道结果如何。我们正在进入黑暗之中”。
    匆匆忙忙踏进四面皆敌的泥坑里的侵略者，现在已经进退维艰。美国国防部发言人18日在记者招待会上承认中东局势“非常棘手”。艾森豪威尔19日向侵黎美军讲话时说：“对你们大家来说，这将是一段困难的时期。”但是直到现在，美英侵略者仍然没有改变他们的侵略计划，他们还在继续集结兵力，准备扩大侵略，还在坚持与全世界人民为敌。眼看美英侵略者将不可避免地要在他们自找的泥坑里愈陷愈深。如果美英侵略者死不回头的话，那末，毫无疑问，不管他们怎样张牙舞爪，中东必然要成为这群侵略者的坟墓！
