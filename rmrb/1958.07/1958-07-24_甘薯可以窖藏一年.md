    Sweet Potatoes Can Be Stored for a Year

    I come from a peasant background and have farmed for over twenty years. I am originally from Tang County, Hebei Province. There are many people but little land in my village, and we plant a lot of high-yield sweet potatoes (i.e., sweet potatoes) every year. Through years of exploration and improvement, we have gained some experience in storing sweet potatoes:

    I. Sweet potatoes are very delicate and susceptible to both cold and heat. Therefore, harvesting should not be done too early. It is best to wait until after the solar term "Frost's Descent" (霜降) in the lunar calendar. The longer the growing time, the greater the ability to resist cold and heat, and the less likely they are to rot. I have actually tested this, and sweet potatoes harvested later generally have a longer storage time. I remember one year the sweet potatoes we harvested were still good when it was almost time to harvest the new year's crop.

    II. Sweet potatoes are also very particular about "hygiene." When harvesting, be careful to remove all the dry and fresh leaves from the small section of vine that is left for tying the sweet potatoes together. If you are even slightly careless and the remaining dry or fresh leaves get into the cellar, it will also cause the sweet potatoes to rot.

    III. After harvesting sweet potatoes, do not put them into the cellar immediately; store them on the ground for three to five days, making sure they are not exposed to sunlight. This is because they contain a lot of moisture when they are first dug out of the ground. Letting the moisture dissipate first will prevent them from rotting when they encounter moisture in the cellar.

    IV. The quality of sweet potato storage is closely related to the depth of the cellar. Generally speaking, the deeper and larger the cellar, the easier it is to preserve the sweet potatoes.

    V. If using an old cellar, scrape off a layer of old soil from the surrounding walls with a pickaxe or shovel before putting the sweet potatoes in, so that the old soil in the cellar is replaced with fresh soil. Then spread a half-finger-thick layer of sand on the floor before putting the sweet potatoes in. Dry and cool sand can absorb heat and moisture from the cellar.

    VI. After the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, check them carefully every three to five days to see if any of the potatoes are "sweating" (appearing as if they have been washed). If you find any, remove them quickly, otherwise they will quickly infect the good potatoes.

    VII. After the Beginning of Spring (立春), the climate changes greatly, so the sweet potatoes should be turned over and ventilated frequently to allow air to circulate.

    If you follow the above methods, sweet potatoes will generally not rot in normal years.

    甘薯可以窖藏一年
    我是农民出身，种过二十余年地。我原籍是河北省唐县。本村人多地少，每年种植高产作物红薯（即甘薯）很多。经逐年摸索改进，我们贮藏红薯有这一些经验：
    一、红薯最娇气，既怕受冷又怕伤热。所以收刨不宜过早，最好是过了农历的霜降，生长时间长，就有了抵抗冷热的能力，不致发生霉烂。我实际试验过，收刨晚的一般贮藏时间长。记得有一年收下的红薯吃到将要收下一年新红薯时还不见霉烂。
    二、红薯又最讲“卫生”。收刨时要注意把留做捆红薯的那一节小短蔓上的干鲜叶摘干净，如果稍有一些大意，留下的干鲜叶进到地窖，也要引起红薯霉烂。
    三、红薯收刨出来，不要马上入窖；要在地上存放三——五天，存放时不要让他见阳光。因刚从地里刨出来水分很大，先让消散水分，免得入窖遇到潮气腐烂。
    四、红薯贮藏的好坏，与地窖深浅有很大关系。一般说来，地窖要深些、大些，红薯容易保存。
    五、使用的地窖要是旧窖，红薯入窖前应先用镐、锨将里边周围的旧土刮下一层，让窖内旧土见新，然将铺上半指厚的沙土，再使红薯入窖。沙土干燥发凉，能吸收窖内的热和水分。
    六、红薯入窖后，隔三——五天要下去详细检查，看看有没有发生出汗（好像水洗过）的薯块。如发现有的话，赶快移出，否则很快就会传染好薯块。
    七、立春以后，气候变化很大，要经常倒焕红薯使空气流通。
    根据以上办法去做的话，一般年份，红薯是不致霉烂的。
