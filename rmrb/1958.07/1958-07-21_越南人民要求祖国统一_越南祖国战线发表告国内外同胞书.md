Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th: On the fourth anniversary of the Vietnam armistice today, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a "Letter to Compatriots at Home and Abroad," calling on all compatriots at home and abroad to unite more broadly and closely and continue to struggle to consolidate peace and realize reunification.

    In this message, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front exposed that for the past four years, the United States has been constantly instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem regime to undermine the Geneva Accords and disrupt the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime has massively suppressed patriotic movements in South Vietnam and stubbornly rejected the proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss and negotiate holding national general elections to achieve national reunification.

    The message stated that the United States' policy of interference and challenge has not only divided Vietnam and turned South Vietnam into a US colony and military base, but also threatens peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

    The message emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities' rejection of the proposals of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam exposes them as vassals of the United States. If they do not quickly abandon this policy, they will not be able to escape the fate of tragic failure, just like those puppet regimes of the past.

    The message calls on the people of the whole country to work diligently in their respective posts with all their patriotic enthusiasm to contribute to opposing US interference in South Vietnam, forcing the South Vietnamese authorities to abandon their policy of acting as vassals of the United States, and listening to the will of the people of the whole country, and accepting the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for mutual consultations.

    The message expresses welcome and support for any sincere proposals made by any individual or group to achieve a meeting between the two sides to discuss the above-mentioned proposals and various issues related to the cause of national reunification, and also welcomes the exchange of visiting groups between the people of the two regions and free travel between the two regions.

    The message emphasizes that peace, unity, independence, and democracy—these are the sincere wishes and iron-like stand of the people of Vietnam. This wish and stand are in line with the inevitable development of the current national independence and world peace movement. If US imperialism continues to run counter to this wish and the tide of history, it will surely suffer a tragic failure!

    The message calls on the Vietnamese people to continuously heighten their vigilance, resolutely oppose all insidious actions of imperialism, and persistently advance the cause of revolution, so that the North moves towards socialism and achieves national reunification.

    The message said: Final victory must belong to the Vietnamese people!

    The message also congratulates the founding of the Republic of Iraq. The message said that the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the great victory of the Iraqi people and regard this victory as their own. The message said that US and British imperialism openly sent troops to Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to annex these countries and threaten the Republic of Iraq and other Arab countries. This behavior is the madness of the colonialists, which has grossly violated international law and created a serious threat to the Middle East and world peace.

    The message said that the Vietnamese people resolutely condemn the brutal acts of US and British imperialism and warmly support the national revolutionary movements of the Arab countries!

    越南人民要求祖国统一
    越南祖国战线发表告国内外同胞书
    新华社河内20日电  越南祖国战线中央委员会在今天越南停战四周年，发表“告国内外同胞书”，号召国内外全体同胞更加广泛和紧密地团结起来，继续为巩固和平、实现统一而奋斗。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会在这篇文告中揭露，四年以来，美国不断唆使吴庭艳政权破坏日内瓦协议，破坏越南的和平统一。吴庭艳政权大肆镇压南越的爱国运动，顽固地拒绝了越南民主共和国政府提出的关于双方协商讨论举行全国普选以实现国家的统一的建议。
    文告说，美国的干涉和挑战政策，不仅分裂了越南，把南越变成了美国的殖民地和军事基地，而且威胁越南和东南亚地区的和平。
    文告强调指出，南越当局拒绝越南民主共和国政府的建议，这就暴露了他们是美国的附庸。如果不赶快放弃这种政策，他们就会像过去的那些傀儡政权一样，无法逃脱惨重失败的命运。
    文告号召全国人民在各自的岗位上，以全部爱国热情努力去活动，为反对美国对越南南方的干涉作出贡献，迫使南越当局放弃充当美国附庸的政策和听从全国人民的意愿，接受越南民主共和国的关于互相进行协商的建议。
    文告表示欢迎和支持任何个人和团体为达到双方会晤以讨论实现上述建议和有关祖国统一事业的各种问题而提出的真诚建议，也欢迎两个地区的人民互派参观团，在两个地区之间自由来往。
    文告强调说，和平、统一、独立、民主——这是越南全国人民的恳切的愿望和钢铁般的立场。这种愿望和立场是符合当前的民族独立和世界和平运动的必然发展的。如果美帝国主义继续同这种愿望、同历史的潮流背道而驰，他们一定要遭到惨重的失败！
    文告号召越南人民不断提高警惕，坚决反对帝国主义一切阴险行动，坚持推进革命的事业，使北方走向社会主义和实现国家的统一。
    文告说：最后胜利一定是属于越南人民的！
    文告还祝贺伊拉克共和国的成立。文告说，越南人民热烈祝贺伊拉克人民的伟大胜利，并且把这个胜利看成自己的胜利。文告说，美、英帝国主义明目张胆地派军队到黎巴嫩和约旦，企图吞并这些国家，威胁伊拉克共和国和其他阿拉伯国家。这种行为是殖民者的疯狂行为，它已经粗暴地违反了国际公法，造成了对中近东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    文告说，越南人民坚决斥责美、英帝国主义的残暴行为，热烈支持阿拉伯各国的民族革命运动！
