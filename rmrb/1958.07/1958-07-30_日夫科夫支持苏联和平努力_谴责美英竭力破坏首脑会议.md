Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 28th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, said in Velingrad that the Bulgarian people unanimously and unconditionally support the Soviet Union's tireless efforts to stop aggression, demand that US-UK interventionists withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan, and save humanity from the scourge of a new war. Zhivkov spoke at the National Travelers' Congress in Velingrad, attended by 30,000 people.

Zhivkov pointed out that the US-UK imperialists are carrying out shameful armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, and are preparing to attack the Republic of Iraq, attempting to strangle the national independence struggles of the Arab countries. He said that the era in which colonialists and imperialists manipulated the fate of nations at will is gone forever. Their military adventures in the Near and Middle East have met with the unstoppable opposition of world public opinion, the Arab people, and the entire socialist camp.

Zhivkov said that Khrushchev's letters to the leaders of the United States, Britain, France, and India were deeply satisfying to the people of all countries. These letters, issued when peace was seriously threatened, serve as a severe warning to the aggressors and a passionate call for peace.

Zhivkov then condemned the actions of Western leaders to sabotage the convening of a summit conference. He pointed out that in doing so, they have gone against the will of the people of all countries who insist on holding high-level meetings immediately.

    日夫科夫支持苏联和平努力
    谴责美英竭力破坏首脑会议
    新华社索菲亚28日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫在云多尔说，保加利亚人民一致无条件地支持苏联旨在制止侵略、要求美英干涉者撤出黎巴嫩和约旦并拯救人类免遭新的战争灾祸的不倦的努力。日夫科夫在云多尔三万人参加的全国旅行者大会上讲了话。
    日夫科夫指出，美英帝国主义者对黎巴嫩和约旦进行着可耻的武装干涉，并且正在准备进攻伊拉克共和国，企图扼杀阿拉伯国家人民的民族独立斗争。他说，殖民主义者和帝国主义者为所欲为地玩弄各国人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。他们在中近东的军事冒险遭到了世界公众、阿拉伯人民和整个社会主义阵营不可遏止的反对。
    日夫科夫说，赫鲁晓夫给美国、英国、法国和印度政府领导人的信，使世界各国人民深感满意。这些在和平受到严重威胁时发出的信件，对于侵略者是一个严重的警告，对和平是一个热情的呼唤。
    日夫科夫随后谴责了西方国家领导人竭力破坏政府首脑会议的召开的行为。他指出，他们这样作，违背了坚持要求立即举行高级会议的各国人民的意志。
