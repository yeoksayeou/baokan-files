    Bean Tree

    Wang Yunxiang, a member of the Qian Sunzhang Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County, Hebei Province, has a strange bean tree in his home that is already four years old. The tree is now more than eight feet tall. Its branches and leaves are similar in shape to those of a pepper tree, but without thorns. This tree has been flowering and bearing pods since the second year of cultivation. The flowers are yellow and very fragrant, and the pods are about the size of mung beans. Each pod contains five or six elongated black seeds that are slightly larger than mung beans. Strangely, this tree blooms twice a year and bears fruit twice. The first flowering is in January, and the second flowering is in July, maturing half a month after flowering. These bean pods are delicious and palatable when tender and used as vegetables, and the mature beans can be ground into flour for eating.

    According to Wang Yunxiang, the owner of the tree, the cultivation method of this tree is very simple. It can be propagated by layering or by raising seedlings. It is not afraid of any disasters except waterlogging, and is very valuable for cultivation.

    豆角树
    河北省文安县前孙章农业社员王云祥家里种着棵奇怪的豆角树，已经四年了。现在这树有八尺多高。它的枝叶和花椒树的形状相似，但没有刺。这棵树从栽培第二年起开始开花结荚。花黄色，很香，结的角和绿豆角大小差不多，每个角内长五、六个比绿豆大点的长形黑籽。奇怪的是，这种树一年开两次花，结两次果。第一次开花在1月，第二次开花在7月，开花半月后成熟。这种豆角嫩时作菜味美适口，成熟后豆粒可磨面吃。
    据树的主人王云祥介绍：这种树的栽培方法很简单。既可压条，也可以育秧。它除怕水外，什么灾害也不怕，很有培育价值。
