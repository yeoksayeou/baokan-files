Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, July 4th: Yumen Oilfield has shown a new situation of being fast, good, and economical in completing its production and construction tasks in the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, drilling workers completed 122% of their drilling footage plan; workers at the oil production plant exceeded the state plan by more than 7,000 tons of crude oil; and refinery workers increased production of only four major products—gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, and lubricating oil—by 4,797 tons. Significant achievements have also been made in reducing costs, increasing labor productivity, and ensuring safety.

After publicizing and implementing the General Line, the workers of Yumen Oilfield have pushed the production upsurge to a new height. Everyone strives to be the best, and rationalization proposals for technological innovation and new production records are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The number of rationalization proposals put forward by oil production workers in the past six months is four times more than the total for the entire year last year. The No. 2 workshop of the refinery boldly reformed its operating methods, increasing the production capacity of the lubricating oil processing equipment by one time compared to the original design. Workers in the cracking section of the No. 1 workshop broke through old production process regulations, increased the yield of light oil, and greatly increased the production of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. The drilling speed of the drilling workers this year is also amazing. In June alone, drilling teams with monthly progress of more than 1,000 meters accounted for more than 40% of all drilling teams in the Yumen Exploration Company. In the past, a good drilling team could only drill one or two exploratory wells a year. This year, Drilling Team 1202 drilled two exploratory wells in one month, one of which was more than 1,200 meters deep.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, July 4th: Uyghur and Hui farmers in Shanshan County, Xinjiang, built a small refinery in three days. It can process more than 300 tons of crude oil annually, refining gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and by-products needed locally.

This small refinery is built in Qiketai Township, more than 20 kilometers east of Shanshan County, at the foot of the Flaming Mountain. This place is sparsely populated. Before liberation, an Uyghur farmer named Amuti discovered crude oil seeping out of the ground here, and took some back to use for lighting lamps. Later, he gradually dug wells to extract oil to supply nearby farmers for lighting, digging a total of thirty-one earthen wells by last year, generally more than twenty meters deep. After testing, the oil content of the shallow oil layer here is very high, but due to the lack of refining equipment, until recently, only crude oil could be produced.

When Yumen Oilfield sent some workers to drill exploratory wells in this area in May this year, they discovered that farmers lacked equipment and could not refine oil, so they decided to help them build a small refinery. The farmers here plan to build seven more small refineries this year. (Attached picture)

    玉门油矿生产建设多快好省
    火焰山下小炼油厂三天建成
    据新华社玉门4日电　玉门油矿今年上半年在完成生产建设任务中，出现了多快好省的新局面。上半年，钻井工人完成了钻井进尺计划122％；采油厂工人超过国家计划增产了七千多吨原油；炼油工人仅汽油、煤油、轻柴油、润滑油等四种主要产品就增产了四千七百九十七吨。降低成本、提高劳动生产率、安全等方面成绩也很突出。
    在宣传贯彻总路线以后，玉门油矿的职工们把生产热潮推向了新的高度。人人不甘落后，个个力争上游，有关技术革新的合理化建议和生产新纪录如雨后春笋不断涌现。采油工人半年来提出的合理化建议就比去年全年总和还多四倍。炼油厂二车间大胆改革操作方法，使机油处理设备的生产能力比原设计提高了一倍。一车间裂化工段的工人冲破旧的生产工艺规程，提高了轻质油收率，大量增产了汽油、煤油、柴油。钻井工人今年的钻井速度也很惊人，仅6月份月进一千公尺以上的钻井队就占玉门勘探公司全部钻井队的40％以上。过去一个好的钻井队一年不过钻一两口探井，今年一二○二钻井队在一个月内就钻成了两口探井，其中一口深达一千二百多公尺。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐4日电　新疆鄯善县维吾尔族和回族农民三天建成了一座小型炼油厂。它每年能处理原油三百多吨，炼制当地所需要的汽油、柴油、煤油和副产品。
    这个小型炼油厂建设在鄯善县城东二十多公里的火焰山下的七克台乡。这里人烟稀少。解放前，维吾尔族老农阿木提曾在这里发现原油渗出地面，便取回一些点灯。以后，逐渐挖井取油，供应附近农民点灯，到去年共挖了三十一个土井，一般已深达二十多公尺。经过化验，这里的浅油层含油率很高，但是由于没有炼油设备，直到最近以前还只能生产原油。
    玉门油矿今年5月派了一部分工人在这一带打探井时，发现农民缺乏设备不能炼油的情况，便决定帮助他们建立小型炼油厂。这里的农民准备在今年再办七个小型炼油厂。（附图片）
