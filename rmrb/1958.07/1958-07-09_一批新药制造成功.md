In the leap forward, a batch of new drugs were successfully manufactured ahead of schedule. According to the original plan, these new drugs would have taken several more years to research and develop successfully.

	Erythromycin
	The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has produced a batch of erythromycin, with an extraction efficiency exceeding that of the United States. The extraction steps are simpler than those of the United States, the extraction speed is faster than that of the United States, and the recovery rate is higher than that of the United States. Erythromycin has a wider range of applications than penicillin, with very little toxicity and reaction. The most important advantage is that erythromycin is very effective for bacteria that penicillin is no longer effective against, such as pyogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Production can begin in a period of time.

	Artificially Synthesized "Bezoar"
	Beijing Tongrentang Chinese Medicine Store has produced artificially synthesized traditional Chinese medicine "Bezoar," which is half the price of natural bezoar. Bezoar is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine widely used in pediatrics, with the functions of clearing the heart and detoxification, calming the nerves and relieving convulsions.

	Four Vaccines and Antitoxins
	The Beijing Biological Products Institute of the Ministry of Health has recently successfully trial-produced four vaccines and antitoxins that were not previously available in China: Scarlet Fever Antitoxin, Dried Influenza Live Virus Vaccine, Dried Purified Encephalitis Vaccine, and Concentrated Heat-Resistant Smallpox Vaccine. The scarlet fever antitoxin successfully trial-produced in our country far exceeds British standards. This antitoxin can be used not only for prevention but also for treatment. After a period of clinical trials, it can be produced. During large-scale epidemics, influenza can stop tens of thousands of people from working. The successful trial production of the dried influenza live virus vaccine may reduce the incidence of influenza in the future. The immunity of this live virus vaccine manufactured in China is higher than that of foreign killed virus vaccines, and it is also more convenient to use. Dried purified encephalitis vaccine has a longer effective period than the liquid encephalitis vaccine used in the past and is easier to preserve. The advantages of concentrated heat-resistant smallpox vaccine over the smallpox vaccine used in the past are that it has a longer shelf life, is easy to use, does not require additional diluent, and is suitable for use in remote areas.

    一批新药制造成功
    跃进声中一批新药提前制造成功。这些新药按原先的计划，是要在几年以后才能研究成功的。
    红霉素
    中国医学科学院制出了一批红霉素，提炼效率超过美国：提炼步骤比美国简单，提炼速度比美国快，收得率比美国高。红霉素的应用范围比青霉素广，毒性和反应很小，最主要的优点是对于青霉素已经不能起作用的细菌如化脓性葡萄状球菌等，用红霉素很有效。隔一个时期可以开始生产。
    人工合成“牛黄”
    北京同仁堂中药店制成了人工合成的中药“牛黄”，价格比天然牛黄低一半。牛黄是一种贵重的中药，在小儿科中应用范围很广泛，有清心解毒、镇惊镇静等作用。
    四种疫苗和抗毒素
    卫生部北京生物制品研究所新近试制成功了四种国内过去没有的疫苗和抗毒素：猩红热抗毒素、干燥流行性感冒活毒疫苗、干燥纯化脑炎疫苗和浓缩耐热牛痘苗。现在我国自己试制成功的猩红热抗毒素，远远超过了英国标准。这种抗毒素不但可用来预防，而且可以治疗。再经过一个时期的临床实验，就可以生产。流行性感冒在大流行的时候，可以使成千上万的人们停止劳动。现在干燥流行性感冒活毒疫苗的试制成功，将来可能使流行性感冒发病率降低。我国制造的这种活毒疫苗的免疫力比外国的死毒疫苗要高，使用也方便。干燥纯化脑炎疫苗，比过去用的液态脑炎疫苗的有效期间长；并且容易保存。浓缩耐热牛痘苗比过去用的牛痘苗的优点是有效期长；使用方便，不需要另加稀释液；适合边远地区使用。
