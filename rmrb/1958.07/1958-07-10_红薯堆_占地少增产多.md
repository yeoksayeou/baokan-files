From the Guangxi Daily: The 80,000-strong labor force of Xing'an County, Guangxi, is universally engaged in creating "sweet potato mounds" to ensure an over-fulfilled bumper harvest this year.

These "sweet potato mounds" are made by simply digging a pit about a foot deep in any sunny, vacant space (or not digging if the ground is hard), and then piling up loose soil to form a round or square mound, one to two meters across and one meter high. Each mound is layered with 600 to 800 catties of fertilizer, such as cow dung, topsoil ash, and tree leaves, in seven layers. Sweet potato seedlings are then planted in each layer at a spacing of 4x5 or 4x6, totaling 250 seedlings per mound. With each seedling yielding two catties of sweet potatoes, each mound can produce 500 catties of sweet potatoes, equivalent to 125 catties of grain. According to the County Party Committee's plan, all rural labor, plus cadres, teachers, and students from institutions and schools, totaling 80,000 people, will each guarantee the creation of four mounds. This will result in a total increase of 40 million catties of grain, enough to feed the county's 200,000 people for five months.

The County Party Committee first utilized vacant land to create 35 "sweet potato mounds" and organized cadres and the masses from townships and communes to visit them. On June 27th, the entire county mobilized, and by July 2nd, a total of 251,960 mounds had been created. Except for a few that occupied the edges of hills, all were piled on the edges of fields, corners of houses, roadsides, riversides, and even sandbars in the middle of rivers – vacant or barren land that had never been cultivated before. Now, large and small "sweet potato mounds" can be seen everywhere in front of and behind villages, and in the open wilderness. Considering that 30 to 40 mounds can be made per mu of land, these 250,000-plus mounds have saved approximately 7,000 mu of farmland.

Based on the characteristics of the "sweet potato mounds," the masses have summarized six major benefits: (1) They do not occupy land and can be widely developed anywhere; (2) Planting, management, and harvesting are convenient, and an average worker can handle three mounds a day. This saves labor and allows for seizing the season; (3) After the sweet potatoes are harvested, the large mound of soil and fertilizer becomes high-quality compost, which can fertilize the fields; (4) High mounds replace deep plowing; (5) The soil is loose, making it easier for sweet potatoes to grow; (6) The yield is high.

In the process of planting sweet potato mounds, the wisdom of the masses is being increasingly enriched. For example, some people quickly discovered that the sweet potato seedlings on the southwest, shady side of the "sweet potato mound," which protrudes one meter above the ground, grew poorly. They immediately came up with a solution: increase the slope on the shady side (approximately 40 degrees) and correspondingly reduce the slope on the sunny side (approximately 30 degrees). This solved the problem of sunlight exposure without expanding the area, and everyone is even more confident in guaranteeing an over-fulfilled increase in production.

### “红薯堆”——占地少增产多

    “红薯堆”——占地少增产多
    广西日报讯  广西兴安县八万劳动力人人动手大搞“红薯堆”，保证今年超额丰产。
    这种“红薯堆”，是随便在一块向阳的空闲地上，挖下约一尺深的坑（地硬也可以不挖），然后用生土堆成一二公尺见方、一公尺高的圆形或方形堆。每堆分七层放下牛栏粪、土皮灰、木叶等肥料六百至八百斤，逐层按行株距4×5、4×6的规格插下薯苗二百五十株。以每株结薯二斤计，每堆可产红薯五百斤，折谷一百二十五斤。据县委计划，全县农村所有的劳动力加机关学校干部学生等共八万人，每人保证搞四堆，总共可以增产四千万斤谷，增产的粮食足够全县二十万人民吃五个月。
    县委首先利用空地做出了三十五个“红薯堆”，并组织乡社干部群众参观。于6月27日全县普遍行动起来，到7月2日止，全县就搞成了二十五万一千九百六十堆。除有部分占用岭边地之外，全部堆在田边、屋角、大路旁、小河边，甚至江心的沙洲等从未种过作物的空闲地或荒地上。现在各地村前、村后，旷野荒郊到处出现了大大小小的“红薯堆”。以每亩土地做三十至四十堆计，二十五万多堆就节省了约七千亩田地。
    根据“红薯堆”的特点，群众总结出六大好处：（一）不占土地，可以随处大发展；（二）种植、管理、收获都方便，一般劳动力一天可以搞三堆；因省劳力可以抢上季节；（三）红薯收了之后，大堆泥和肥都变成优质沤肥，可以肥田；（四）高堆代替了深耕；（五）土松，红薯容易生长；（六）产量高。
    群众在种红薯堆中，智慧也越来越丰富地发挥出来了。譬如有些人很快就发现：突出地面一公尺高的“红薯堆”，西南方背阳的一面薯苗生长较差，他们动动脑筋立即想出办法：把背阳一面的坡度放大（约四十度），相对地减少了向阳一面的坡度（约三十度）。这样解决了日照问题又不扩大面积，大家更有信心保证超额增产了。
