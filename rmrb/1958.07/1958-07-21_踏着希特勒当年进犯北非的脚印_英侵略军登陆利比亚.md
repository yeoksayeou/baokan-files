Xinhua News Agency, July 20th, London dispatch: British imperialism continues to amass forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, attempting to further expand its aggressive activities in the Middle East and Near East. According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Defense on the evening of July 19th, the British Royal Marine 45 Commando, totaling 400 men, has been ordered to land at the port of Tobruk in Libya, bordering the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic. The pretext for the landing is a "precautionary measure" taken due to the tense situation in the Middle East. Observers point out that, due to its geographical location, the port of Tobruk has "strategic importance" in the current US-British military operations to invade the Middle East.

    新华社20日讯  伦敦消息：英帝国主义继续在东地中海集结力量，企图进一步扩大它在中近东的侵略活动。据英国国防部19日晚间宣布，英国皇家海军陆战队第四十五支队共四百人已经奉命在与阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区接壤的利比亚的土布鲁克港登陆。登陆借口是由于中东局势紧张而采取的一种“预防性措施”。观察家指出，土布鲁克港由于它的地理位置，在目前美英侵略中东的军事行动中具有“战略的重要性”。
