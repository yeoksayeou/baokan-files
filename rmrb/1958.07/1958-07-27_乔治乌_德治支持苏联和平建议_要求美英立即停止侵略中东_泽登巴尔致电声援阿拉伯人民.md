Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th: Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, said at a banquet on the evening of the 25th that the Romanian people express warm sympathy to the people of Iraq and to all Arab people who are resolutely fighting for freedom and independence.

Gheorghiu-Dej attended the banquet held by the Romanian Council of Ministers on the same day to celebrate the withdrawal of the last batch of Soviet troops from Romania.

Gheorghiu-Dej said at the banquet that the withdrawal of foreign troops from all countries is an important issue in ensuring lasting peace and easing international tensions. The joint decision of the Soviet government and the Romanian government to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in Romania is one of the actions in this regard.

Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the troops of Western countries, especially the United States, are currently stationed in many countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The provocative acts of armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan have once again exposed the true face of the imperialists, proving that they are enemies of the freedom and independence of the people.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian people fully support the Soviet proposals to stop imperialist aggression in the Middle East. Together with the people of all peace-loving countries in the world, they hope that the summit conference to be held within the framework of the Security Council will adopt just solutions that are in line with the interests of the Arab people, so as to be conducive to restoring peace in the Middle East and easing international tensions.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, 26th: Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, stated that if the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate, the Mongolian people and their government are ready to give the Arab people engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle all possible support.

Tsedenbal made this statement in a reply telegram on the 25th to Kamal Baha el-Din, Acting Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council. Baha el-Din had sent a telegram calling on the Mongolian People's Republic to support the struggle of the people of the Middle East. In his reply telegram, Tsedenbal said that the Mongolian people and their government demand an immediate halt to the colonialist and bandit acts of US and British imperialism in the Middle East, so that the people of this region can enjoy the right to handle their own affairs.

    乔治乌——德治支持苏联和平建议
    要求美英立即停止侵略中东
    泽登巴尔致电声援阿拉伯人民
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治25日晚上在一个宴会上说，罗马尼亚人民对伊拉克人民，对所有为自由和独立而坚决斗争的阿拉伯人民表示热烈的同情。
    乔治乌—德治当天出席了罗马尼亚部长会议为欢送撤离罗马尼亚的最后一批苏联军队而举行的宴会。
    乔治乌—德治在宴会上说，从一切国家撤退外国军队是保证持久和平和缓和国际紧张局势的重要问题。苏联政府同罗马尼亚政府共同决定撤退驻扎在罗马尼亚的苏联军队，就是这方面的行动之一。
    乔治乌—德治指出，西方国家的军队，特别是美国军队目前还驻扎在欧洲、亚洲、非洲的许多国家。美英两国对黎巴嫩和约旦进行武装干涉的挑衅行为，又一次暴露了帝国主义者的真正面目，证明他们是人民的自由和独立的敌人。
    乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚人民完全支持苏联关于制止帝国主义对中东的侵略的建议。他们同全世界爱好和平国家的人民一道，希望将来在安全理事会范围内举行的政府首脑会议，能够采取符合阿拉伯人民的利益的正当解决办法，以有利于恢复中东和平和缓和国际紧张局势。
    新华社乌兰巴托26日电　蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔表示，如果中东地区的局势继续恶化，蒙古人民和他们的政府随时准备给以进行反殖民主义斗争的阿拉伯人民以一切可能的支持。
    泽登巴尔是在25日给亚非人民团结理事会书记处代理总书记卡迈勒·巴哈勒丁的一封复电中作这个表示的。巴哈勒丁曾经打电报呼吁蒙古人民共和国支持中东人民的斗争。泽登巴尔在复电中说，蒙古人民和他们的政府要求立即制止美英帝国主义在中东的殖民主义强盗行为，以便使这个地区的人民能够享受处理自己的事务的权利。
