    Achievements in North Korea's Water Conservancy and Irrigation Construction
    Jin Zaixu, Vice Minister of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    One of the most important achievements of the Korean people in the struggle to realize agricultural collectivization and rapidly develop agricultural production after the war is the achievements they have made in socialist construction.
    From the ceasefire to March of this year, 98.3% of the total number of farming households in North Korea joined agricultural production cooperatives. Last year, they overcame rare droughts and floods, increasing grain production by 120% compared to 1948.
    The Korean Workers' Party has consistently implemented the correct economic policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture. While promoting national industrialization, it has adopted various countermeasures to develop agriculture and further consolidate the material and technical foundation of the countryside. In this regard, water conservancy and irrigation construction has achieved epoch-making achievements.
    Korea's climate is a mix of continental and oceanic climates, with relatively high rainfall. Korean farmers have a long tradition of developing water conservancy. According to the "Book of the Later Han, Biographies of the Eastern Barbarians" in Korean historical records, Korean farmers had extensively developed paddy fields in the Hunan region (North and South Jeolla Provinces) as early as 200-300 BC, and built dikes along both banks of the Han River and the Geum River. Later, in 330 AD, the first large-scale reservoir in Korea, the Byeokgolje Reservoir in Gimje, was built. By 1415, during the Joseon Dynasty, the king mobilized 10,000 soldiers and 10,000 farmers to rebuild the Byeokgolje Reservoir into a large reservoir capable of irrigating 16,000 jeongbo of paddy fields. At this time, Korean farmers also improved the method of planting rice from direct seeding to transplanting. Farmers also manufactured and used waterwheels to draw water from rivers and ponds to irrigate fields.
    By the beginning of the 20th century, more than 3,700 reservoirs and 9,300 large and small river dams had been built in South Chungcheong Province, North Gyeongsang Province, Hwanghae Province, and other places, irrigating 200,000 jeongbo of paddy fields. The feudal ruling class at that time established an official dedicated to registering and managing water conservancy and irrigation projects from 1730 to exploit the peasants.
    After the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea, although 189 water conservancy and irrigation construction projects were carried out from 1910 to 1938, due to Japan's low technology and the speculative behavior of private contractors, the project costs were very expensive, and most of the projects were of poor quality and unsafe. As a result, farmers not only did not benefit from irrigation, but also lost their land and became poorer due to the Japanese rulers' heavy extortion of predatory water conservancy taxes.
    After liberation, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government put forward the task of turning North Korea from a grain-deficient area into a grain-surplus area. To realize this task, it was first necessary to expand the area of ​​paddy fields and expand water conservancy and irrigation projects to ensure the stability of agricultural production.
    Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out early on that there are rivers everywhere in Korea. We must find ways to prevent these waters from flowing into the sea in vain, and make full use of them to expand the area of ​​paddy fields. Premier Kim Il-sung's instructions infinitely encouraged the farmers. In this way, from the liberation to the start of the war, the Republic government invested a total of 1.9 billion won in water conservancy and irrigation construction, expanding the irrigated area by 38,000 jeongbo, making the irrigated area 39% larger than in the early days of liberation.
    The Korean War launched by the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique severely damaged North Korea's water conservancy and irrigation facilities. According to incomplete statistics, during the three-year war, 47 reservoirs, 63 pumping stations, 4,552 river dams and water conservancy buildings, and 26,500 meters of river embankments were destroyed. Even in this difficult wartime environment, the Party and the government organized the restoration and construction of water conservancy and irrigation facilities, expanding the irrigated area by more than 16,000 jeongbo and the land protection area by more than 3,000 jeongbo during the war.
    After the war, North Korea's water conservancy and irrigation construction underwent an epoch-making transformation. During the three-year plan from 1954 to 1956, large-scale state-owned water conservancy and irrigation projects such as the South Pyongan Province Irrigation Project with an irrigation area of ​​87,000 jeongbo and private irrigation projects with an irrigation area of ​​47,000 jeongbo were completed. In 1957, the irrigated area was expanded by another 27,000 jeongbo. During these four years, the irrigated area was expanded by a total of 161,000 jeongbo, which is equivalent to more than 1.7 times the irrigated area of ​​the water conservancy and irrigation projects built in North Korea during the 28 years of Japanese rule.
    In particular, during the period from August 1955 to May 1956, according to the 73rd decision of the North Korean Cabinet in 1955 on launching a mass movement to build water conservancy and irrigation, the Korean working people displayed endless creative spirit and patriotic enthusiasm, and built 317 large, medium and small water conservancy and irrigation projects. The total earthwork volume of these projects reached more than 20 million cubic meters, the total length of canals was more than 1,380 kilometers, the total length of river embankments was 248 kilometers, the amount of concrete work was 300,000 cubic meters, the total length of tunnels was 11 kilometers, and there were more than 6,300 various large and small buildings. The state provided a large amount of materials, construction equipment, and transportation means for these projects. The project used a total of more than 17 million man-days, of which farmers contributed 6 million man-days, and cadres, students, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers contributed more than 2 million man-days. As a result, during this project period, eight large reservoirs, including the largest reservoir in North Korea, the Yeonpung Reservoir of the South Pyongan Province Irrigation Project, and large pumping stations with the latest equipment were newly built. The completion of this batch of irrigation projects alone expanded the irrigated area by 37,000 jeongbo. The area irrigated in these eight or nine months is equivalent to the area expanded during the 18 years from 1928 to 1945 during the Japanese rule. This great victory once again demonstrated the powerful strength of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people.
    In this way, by 1957, the total irrigated area in North Korea accounted for 26.3% of the total arable land area, and the proportion of paddy fields benefiting from water conservancy increased from 55% at the time of the ceasefire to 77%. Due to the extensive construction of river embankments, the protection area increased to 254,000 jeongbo.
    In order to successfully complete the huge agricultural production increase task in the first five-year plan, widely carrying out water conservancy and irrigation construction is still one of the country's important policies. Recently, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government decided to greatly carry out water conservancy and irrigation construction during the first five-year plan. By 1961, the paddy field area will be expanded to more than 600,000 jeongbo, and a dry land irrigation system will be established so that more than 500,000 jeongbo of dry land will be irrigated. This shows that we must develop water conservancy and irrigation at an unprecedented speed.
    The water conservancy and irrigation projects carried out during the first five-year plan include the two large-scale irrigation projects in Giyang and Eojitun, and tens of thousands of small and medium-sized irrigation projects. In addition, the development of alkaline land on the western coast will be carried out, which is of great significance for expanding the cultivated land area. There are also river embankment projects that can protect more than 130,000 jeongbo of land from floods, with a total length of 1.32 million meters. In order to prevent floods, large-scale flood storage projects will also be built on the east and west coasts.
    After the completion of the above projects, the paddy field area in North Korea will reach more than five times that of the end of 1945, and 80,000 jeongbo of newly developed coastal alkaline land will be available. Due to the completion of the dry land irrigation system, drought can be completely overcome. New achievements will also be made in the comprehensive utilization of water conservancy in the construction of these irrigation projects. The North Hwanghae Province Eojitun Irrigation Project is also a hydroelectric power station and a supply station to meet the industrial water needs of nearby industries. When building flood control reservoirs on the east and west coasts, dozens of power stations, water supply systems, industrial water, and irrigation systems will be built at the same time. Through the construction of these irrigation projects, various forms of reservoirs and lakes will be built in various places, making Korea's beautiful rivers and mountains even more beautiful. With the expansion of the paddy field area to 600,000 jeongbo, the rice production in North Korea will exceed 2 million tons. As Comrade Kim Il-sung said, rice will become the main food for the people of North Korea at that time. Dry land in North Korea accounts for 70% of the total cultivated land area, and irrigating dry land is an important link in increasing crop production.
    This huge plan has been warmly welcomed by the Korean people and is being successfully implemented. The two large-scale irrigation projects in the Giyang area and the Eojitun area were started last year. The Giyang Irrigation Project pumps water from the Daedong River and stores it in the Taesong Reservoir, which can hold 140 million cubic meters of water. Then, it irrigates 35,000 jeongbo of land in six counties of South Pyongan Province through 28 tunnels and main and branch canals with a total length of 600 kilometers. The Eojitun Irrigation Project pumps water from the Seohung River into the Chonggyeri Reservoir, which has a capacity of 150 million cubic meters. Then, it irrigates 23,000 jeongbo of land through 13 tunnels and more than 300 kilometers of main and branch canals. After the completion of these two projects, grain production can be increased by 100,000 tons per year. The workers and farmers participating in these two construction projects are determined to complete them one year ahead of schedule. They have completed 2.6 million cubic meters of earthwork and excavated nine tunnels in a few months, greatly exceeding the plan.
    The small and medium-sized irrigation projects invested and built by agricultural production cooperatives themselves are also progressing successfully. Among the tens of thousands of projects planned to be carried out during the first five-year plan, 30,000 were started in 1958. These projects will irrigate 60,000 jeongbo of farmland. Among them, farmers in South Hwanghae Province started construction of more than 16,000 small and medium-sized irrigation projects this year, and more than 280 pumping stations and more than 190 reservoirs have been completed, increasing the irrigated area by 30,000 jeongbo.
    In order to successfully complete the above-mentioned huge water conservancy and irrigation construction projects, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have taken several important measures.
    1. Correctly distinguish between state investment targets and agricultural cooperative investment targets. Large-scale projects such as the construction of large-scale irrigation projects and embankment projects, the development of coastal alkaline land, and flood control reservoirs are invested by the state. Small and medium-sized water conservancy and irrigation projects are invested by agricultural cooperatives, and the state supplies construction materials and provides technical assistance.
    2. Improve investment efficiency and first carry out projects with less investment and greater benefits. The current primary tasks are: to convert the last 80,000 jeongbo of paddy fields that cannot be irrigated into irrigated beneficial fields; to develop new irrigation areas; to develop coastal alkaline land; and to convert dry land into paddy fields.
    3. While carrying out new construction projects, strengthen the restoration of old equipment and make rational use of it. Rationally adjusting and utilizing the existing old water conservancy and irrigation facilities in Korea can expand the irrigated area by tens of thousands of jeongbo without additional investment.
    4. Reduce costs, increase construction speed and quality. Implement mechanized and prefabricated construction methods, actively promote small mechanization, and eliminate simple manual operations and back-carrying.
    The Korean people have the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, and the industrial base developed under the Party's correct policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, especially the machinery industry, fully supplies the materials needed for water conservancy and irrigation construction. The economic foundation of agricultural cooperatives is being consolidated year by year, and the farmers' enthusiasm for construction for expanded reproduction is very high. The personnel in the water conservancy and irrigation department have accumulated valuable experience through the huge water conservancy and irrigation construction projects after the war, and their technical level has also been significantly improved. The Korean people also have the selfless, continuous assistance of the people of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. All this is a guarantee for us to successfully complete the huge water conservancy and irrigation construction projects.

    朝鲜水利灌溉建设的成就
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国农业省副相  金载旭
    朝鲜人民在战后实现农业合作化和迅速发展农业生产的斗争中所取得的成就，是朝鲜人民在社会主义建设方面所取得的最重要的成就之一。
    停战后到今年3月为止，占朝鲜北部总农户数的98.3％的农户参加了农业生产合作社。他们去年战胜了稀有的干旱和洪水，使粮食增产为1948年的120％。
    朝鲜劳动党战后一贯实行着优先发展重工业同时发展轻工业和农业的正确的经济政策，它在促进国家工业化的同时，采取各种对策来发展农业，并进一步巩固农村的物质技术基础。在这方面，水利灌溉建设工作获得了划时代的成就。
    朝鲜的气候是大陆性气候和海洋性气候相间的气候，降雨量较多。朝鲜农民有发展水利的悠久传统。据朝鲜历史文献遗书东夷传记载，在公元前二三百年时，朝鲜农民已在湖南地方（全罗南北道）广泛开发水田，并在汉江和锦江两岸修筑了堤防。以后在公元330年建成了朝鲜最早的大规模的水库——金堤的僻沟堤。到公元1415年李朝时，国王动员了军队和农民各一万人把僻沟堤改建为能灌溉一万六千町步水田的大水库。这时朝鲜农民种水稻的方法也由直接播种的方法改进到插秧的方法了。农民也制造和运用水车，把江河和池塘里的水引上来灌田。
    到了二十世纪初，已经在忠清南道、庆尚北道、黄海道等地建成了三千七百多个水库和九千三百多座大型和小型的拦河坝，灌溉着二十万町步水田。当时的封建统治阶级从1730年开始设置了一个专门登记和管理水利灌溉事业的官员，来剥削农民。
    日本帝国主义者侵占朝鲜后，从1910年到1938年的二十八年间，虽然进行了一百八十九所水利灌溉建设工程，但是由于日本的技术低下，私人承包商的投机行为，工程费十分昂贵，而大部分工程质量低劣，又不安全。结果农民不但没有得到灌溉的利益，反而因日本统治者强征大量的掠夺性的水利税而失去土地，生活更加贫困。
    解放后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府提出了把朝鲜北部由缺粮区变成余粮区的任务。为实现这个任务，首先要扩大水田面积和扩建水利灌溉工程，保障农业生产的稳定性。
    金日成首相很早以前就指出，朝鲜到处都有江河，我们要设法不让这些水白白流到海里去，完全加以利用，来扩大水田面积。金日成首相的指示无限地鼓舞了农民。这样，在解放后到战争开始前，共和国政府对水利灌溉建设投资共十九亿元，扩大了灌溉面积三万八千町步，使灌溉面积比解放初期扩大了39％。
    美帝国主义和李承晚集团发动的朝鲜战争，使朝鲜北部的水利灌溉设施遭到严重破坏。据不完全统计，在三年战争时期有四十七所水库、六十三所抽水站、四千五百五十二处拦水坝和水利建筑物、二万六千五百公尺河堤遭到了破坏。即使在这种艰苦的战争环境中，党和政府也组织了水利灌溉设施的恢复建设工作，使在战时灌溉面积扩大了一万六千多町步，土地保护面积扩大了三千多町步。
    战后，朝鲜的水利灌溉建设有了划时代的转变，在从1954年到1956年的三年计划期间内，建成了规模宏大的平安南道灌溉工程等灌溉面积达八万七千町步的国营水利灌溉工程和灌溉面积达四万七千町步的民营灌溉工程，1957年又扩大了灌溉面积二万七千町步，这四年期间，共扩大了十六万一千多町步的灌溉面积，这等于日本统治朝鲜时期二十八年中朝鲜北部所兴修的水利灌溉工程的灌溉面积的一点七倍多。
    特别是在1955年8月到1956年5月这一期间，根据1955年朝鲜内阁通过的关于开展建设水利灌溉的群众运动的第七十三号决定，朝鲜劳动人民发挥了无穷尽的创造精神和爱国热情，建成了三百一十七项大中小型的水利灌溉工程。这些工程的总土方量达二千多万公方，水渠总长一千三百八十多公里，江河堤防总长二百四十八公里，混凝土工程量三十万立方，隧道总长十一公里，各种大小建筑物六千三百多个。国家为这些工程提供了大量的资材、建设器材和运输手段。工程共用了一千七百多万人工，其中农民出了六百万个工，机关干部、学生、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军出了二百多万个工。结果，在这一段工程期间内，新建成了朝鲜最大的水库——平安南道灌溉工程延丰水库等八个大水库和具有最新式设备的大抽水站。仅这一批灌溉工程的建成，就扩大了三万七千町步的灌溉面积。这八九个月的时间内扩大的灌溉面积等于日本统治时期从1928年到1945年十八年扩大的灌溉面积。这个伟大的胜利再一次显示了朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民的强大力量。
    这样一来，到1957年，朝鲜北部总灌溉面积占总耕地面积的26.3％，水田中水利受益田的比重从刚停战时的55％增加到77％，由于广泛进行了江河堤防的建设，保护面积增加到二十五万四千町步。
    为了胜利完成第一个五年计划中庞大的农业增产任务，广泛进行水利灌溉建设仍是国家的重要政策之一。最近朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府决定，在第一个五年计划期间内要大大地进行水利灌溉建设。到1961年，水田面积将扩大到六十万町步以上，建立旱田灌溉系统，使五十万町步以上的旱田得到灌溉。这说明我们要以史无前例的速度发展水利灌溉事业。
    在第一个五年计划期间内进行的水利灌溉工程，有岐阳和于之屯两项大规模的灌溉工程，和数万个中小规模灌溉工程。另外，还要进行西海岸海滩碱地的开发工作，这对扩大耕地面积有重大意义。还有能使十三万町步以上的土地免受水灾，总长度一百三十二万公尺的河堤工程，为了防止洪水，还要在东西海岸建设大规模的蓄洪工程。
    上述工程完成后，朝鲜北部水田面积将达1945年年底的五倍以上，新开发海滩碱地八万町步。由于建成旱田灌溉系统，将可完全战胜旱灾。进行这些灌溉工程的建设，在综合利用水利方面也将取得新的成就。黄海北道于之屯灌溉工程同时是一个水力发电站和满足附近工业用水的供应站。在东西海岸建设调节洪水的蓄洪工程时，将同时进行数十所发电站、自来水系统、工业用水和灌溉系统等建设工程。通过这些灌溉工程的建设，将在各地建成各种形式的水库和湖泊，使朝鲜的美丽的河山更加美丽。水田面积扩大到六十万町步，朝鲜北部的水稻产量将超过二百万吨。这样就如同金日成同志所说，到那时候大米将成为朝鲜北部人民的主要食粮。朝鲜北部的旱田占总耕地面积的70％，使旱田受到灌溉是增产农作物的重要环节。
    这个庞大的计划受到了朝鲜人民的热烈欢迎，并已胜利地执行着。规模宏大的岐阳地区和于之屯地区的两项灌溉工程已从去年开始着手进行。岐阳灌溉工程是把大同江水抽上来，储存在能容水一亿四千万立方的泰星水库中，然后通过二十八条隧道和总长六百公里的干渠和支渠去灌溉平安南道六个郡的三万五千町步土地。于之屯灌溉工程是把瑞兴江的水抽到容水量一亿五千万立方的清溪里水库中，然后通过十三条隧道和三百多公里长的干渠支渠去灌溉二万三千町步土地。这两项工程建成后每年可增产十万吨粮食。参加这两项建设工程的工人和农民决心提前一年建成，他们在几个月的时间内就已完成了二百六十万公方的土方工程，开凿了九条隧道，大大地超过了计划。
    农业生产合作社自己投资兴建的中小型灌溉工程也在胜利进行，在第一个五年计划期间准备进行的数万个工程中有三万个在1958年开工。这些工程将使六万町步农田得到灌溉。其中黄海南道农民今年开工兴建了一万六千多个中小型灌溉工程，已有二百八十多个抽水站和一百九十多个水库建成，增加了灌溉面积三万町步。
    为胜利完成上述庞大的水利灌溉建设工程，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府采取了几项重要措施。
    一、正确区别国家投资对象和农业社投资对象。大规模的灌溉工程和堤防工程的建设、海滩碱地的开发、调节洪水的蓄洪工程等大规模工程由国家投资。中小型水利灌溉工程由农业社投资，由国家供应建设材料，在技术上进行帮助。
    二、提高投资效率，首先进行投资少、收效大的工程。当前首要的任务是：把最后八万町步不能受到灌溉的水田改为灌溉受益田；开发新的灌溉区域；开发海滩碱地；把旱田改为水田。
    三、在进行新建工程的同时，加强对旧设备的恢复，予以合理利用。把朝鲜现有的许多旧的水利灌溉设施加以合理地调整和利用，就能够不追加投资而扩大上万町步的灌溉面积。
    四、降低成本、提高建设速度和质量。实行机械化和装配式的施工方法，积极推广小机械化，消灭单纯手工操作和用背背的现象。
    朝鲜人民有朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和共和国政府的正确领导，有在优先发展重工业特别是机械工业的党的正确政策下发展起来的工业基地充分供应着水利灌溉建设所需的材料，农业社的经济基础逐年得到巩固，农民为扩大再生产进行建设的情绪非常高涨，水利灌溉部门的人员通过战后庞大的水利灌溉建设工程积累了宝贵的经验，技术水平也有了显著提高，朝鲜人民还有以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的兄弟国家人民的无私的继续不断的援助，这一切是我们胜利完成巨大的水利灌溉建设工程的保证。
