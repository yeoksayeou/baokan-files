(Our Moscow dispatch, 30th) The summer examinations in Soviet universities and colleges have now all concluded, and students have started their summer vacations. Recently, the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Mr. Yelyutin, stated that 290,000 university students will graduate in the Soviet Union this summer. Their employment has been comprehensively and properly arranged. Among them, 90,000 will become engineers, 100,000 will teach in secondary schools, 30,000 graduates from agricultural colleges will be assigned to work in rural areas or agricultural research institutions, and more than 20,000 medical school graduates will supplement the ranks of Soviet medical workers. Over 4,000 students have graduated from Moscow University, the largest group in recent years.

Most of the students graduating from universities and colleges this year will go to the eastern regions of the Soviet Union to participate in construction. Many graduates have proactively written to the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, requesting to be sent to participate in construction work in the eastern and remote regions. Their wishes have been fulfilled.

Yelyutin also said that this year's enrollment in universities and colleges has already begun, with a planned enrollment of 440,000 students, 80% of whom will be specifically recruited from young people on production posts.

(Our Moscow dispatch, 30th) In line with the needs of large-scale construction, the Soviet Union is preparing to vigorously expand its correspondence education network in the next few years, so as to train more construction talent in a shorter period of time, together with regular universities and colleges. This was stated by Mr. Vasin, Director of the Correspondence and Evening Education Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, in a recent conversation with reporters. Vasin said: Soviet correspondence education has a history of thirty-eight years. The purpose and task of Soviet correspondence education are: to improve the theoretical level of existing technical personnel in factories and enterprises, to train a large number of new technical cadres, and to enable middle school graduates participating in construction to continue to deepen their theoretical studies. Vasin pointed out that not all subjects can be taught by correspondence. Those majors that are complex, highly technical, and mainly rely on experiments cannot be taught by correspondence.

Currently, there are twenty-three correspondence universities in the Soviet Union, seventeen of which are in Moscow. There are also more than one hundred branch schools of correspondence universities in various places. In addition, more than four hundred universities and colleges in the Soviet Union have correspondence departments. The largest correspondence university in the Soviet Union is the Moscow General Technical University, with 30,000 students and sixty-two majors. There are two hundred majors in all Soviet correspondence universities, with a total of 870,000 students, accounting for more than 40% of all university students in the Soviet Union (including correspondence students).

Vasin concluded by saying that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union will greatly expand its correspondence education network and increase the number of correspondence students. After seven years, the number of correspondence university students should exceed the number of full-time students.

    苏联高等教育今年又结丰硕之果
    大批青年专家奔向生产岗位
    许多青年要求到东部和边远地区工作
    本报莫斯科30日电　目前苏联各高等学校的暑期考试已全部结束，大学生已经开始了暑假生活。不久前，苏联高等教育部部长叶留金说，今年暑假在苏联有二十九万大学生毕业，他们的工作问题已经获得了全面的妥善的安排，其中有九万人将成为工程师，有十万人将到中等学校去担任教学工作，三万大学生从农业高等学校毕业被分配到农村或农业研究机关工作，另外有两万多医学院毕业生将补充苏联医务工作者的队伍。在莫斯科大学有四千多大学生毕业，这是近年来最大的一批。
    今年高等学校毕业的学生大部分将去苏联东部地区参加建设工作。很多毕业生都主动地写信给苏联高等教育部，要求派他们去参加东部地区和边远地区的建设工作。他们的愿望都得到了满足。
    叶留金还说，今年高等学校的招生工作已经开始，今年的招生名额将达到四十四万名，其中80％学生将专门录取来自生产岗位的青年。
    本报莫斯科30日电　随着大规模建设的需要，苏联在今后几年内准备大力扩大函授教育网，以便在更短的期间内同正规的高等学校一起，培养出更多的建设人才。这是苏联高等教育部函授与夜大学教育局局长瓦辛日前在和记者谈到的。瓦辛说：苏联的函授教育已有三十八年的历史。苏联函授教育的目的和任务是：提高现有工厂企业技术人员的理论水平，大量培养新的技术干部，使参加建设的中学毕业生能继续在理论上得到深造。瓦辛指出，并不是所有学科都可以函授，课程复杂、技术性较高而主要依靠实验的那些专业，不能进行函授。
    目前，全苏有二十三所函授大学，其中十七所在莫斯科。各地还有函授大学分院一百多所，另外，全苏四百多所高等学校还附设函授部。全苏最大的函授大学是莫斯科的综合技术大学，有三万学生，六十二种专业。全苏函授大学有二百种专业，共八十七万学生。占全苏大学生（包括函授大学生）的40％以上。
    瓦辛最后说，在今后七年中，苏联要大大扩大函授教育网，增加函授学生的人数。七年后函授大学生的数量要超过正式生的数量。
