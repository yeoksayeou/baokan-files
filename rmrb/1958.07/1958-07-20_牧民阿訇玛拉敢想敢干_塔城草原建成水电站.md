    Herdsman Imam Mara Dares to Think and Act
    A Hydroelectric Station Built on the Tacheng Grassland
    (Our Dispatch) Uyghur herdsman Imam Mara built a small hydroelectric station on the Emin County grassland without the help of any technical personnel. Now, electric lights have been installed in his home and mill for lighting. This is the first hydroelectric station to appear on the Tacheng Prefecture grassland.
    Imam Mara is a herdsman from Emin County, Tacheng Prefecture. He once worked as a truck driver and understands some simple principles of electricity generation. He had been thinking about how to use the water used for grinding flour to generate electricity. Once, he went to the Emin County Club and saw a 10-kilowatt generator that had been damaged for decades, and asked to take this scrapped generator to repair. After he took the generator home, he tried every means to repair it, made an impulse turbine out of wood, and built a small tent-shaped house out of earth and mud. After more than a year of hard work and repeated experiments, he finally generated electricity.
    Imam Mara's bold creative spirit and drive have been praised by the Tacheng Prefectural Party Committee and the Emin County Party Committee. (Han Wenhui)

    牧民阿訇玛拉敢想敢干
    塔城草原建成水电站
    本报讯　维吾尔族牧民阿訇玛拉在没有任何技术人员帮助的情况下，在额敏县草原上建成一座小型水电站。现在，他的家里和磨坊都安装起电灯来照明。这是塔城专区草原上出现的第一座水电站。
    阿訇玛拉是塔城专区额敏县一个牧民，他曾经作过一段汽车司机工作，懂得一点简单的发电原理，他一直在设想如何用磨面的水来发电。有一次他到额敏县俱乐部看到一部已损坏了几十年的十个瓩的发电机，便要求把这部报废的发电机交给他去试修。他把这部发电机弄到家里之后，千方百计地进行修理，用木头制了一个冲击式的水轮机，用土块和泥巴垒了一个帐篷形的小房子，经过一年多的苦钻和反复试验，终于发出了电。
    阿訇玛拉这种大胆的创造精神和干劲，受到中共塔城地委和额敏县委的表扬。　（韩文慧）
