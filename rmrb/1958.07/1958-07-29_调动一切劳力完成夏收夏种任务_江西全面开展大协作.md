    Mobilize All Labor to Complete the Summer Harvest and Planting Tasks:
    Jiangxi Comprehensively Carries Out Large-Scale Cooperation

    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) In order to overcome labor shortages and ensure the timely completion of the summer harvest and planting, various regions in Jiangxi Province are employing a method of communist-style large-scale cooperation.
    The "heavy tasks, short timeframe, and high requirements" are the prominent characteristics of this year's summer harvest and planting in Jiangxi. To achieve an even greater harvest for the entire year, all 24 million mu of early rice in the province must be harvested by the end of July, or at the latest by early August, and meticulous harvesting and gleaning must be ensured, with every grain returned home. After the early rice is harvested and the second-season late rice is planted, efforts should be made to exceed the yield of early rice, and the mid-season rice should be given a final push in field management. In addition, there is a need to rush the planting of sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grain crops, resulting in an exceptional shortage of labor.
    To address this issue, Party organizations at all levels across the province are organizing communist-style large-scale cooperation between mountain areas and plains, economic crop areas and grain crop areas, early-maturing areas and late-maturing areas, single-season rice areas and double-season rice areas, and urban and rural areas. This is done to both rationally and fully utilize all labor in the summer harvest and planting, ensuring its timely completion. In the Gannan Administrative District, cooperation committees have been established at every level, from the district to the commune, with dedicated personnel responsible for leading and organizing cooperation between districts, townships, and communes. In Ji'an Prefecture's Jishui County, the task of the summer harvest and planting is to harvest 580,000 mu of early rice, plant 250,000 mu of sweet potatoes, densely plant 50,000 mu of continuous-cropping late rice, and 100,000 mu of second-season late rice within a period of fifteen to twenty days. However, the county only has 90,000 laborers, making the "double-rush" task extremely demanding. However, from a regional perspective, the 15 townships in the Shuixi hilly area have a large population but little land, early rice matures quickly, and there is no habit of planting sweet potatoes; the 21 townships in the Shuidong mountainous area have a small population but much land, early rice matures seven days later, and there is a habit of planting sweet potatoes. In response to this situation, the Jishui County Party Committee organized cooperation between these two regions: the Shuixi hilly area supported the Shuidong mountainous area with 300,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings, and the Shuidong mountainous area first supported the Shuixi area with harvesting and planting, and then the Shuixi hilly area supported the Shuidong mountainous area with harvesting and planting, so that all materials and manpower could be fully utilized. The Guangfeng County Party Committee in Shangrao Prefecture calculated in detail that 910,000 labor days were lacking in the summer harvest and planting. To address this, the Guangfeng County Party Committee, based on the varying maturity of early rice in the plains, hills, and mountainous areas of the county, divided the area into three battlefields. According to the commune members' technical specialties, they organized shock teams for harvesting rice, threshing, plowing fields, transplanting seedlings, and transportation. When the first battlefield entered combat, personnel from the second and third battlefields were mobilized to assist, and finally, personnel from the first and second battlefields were transferred to support the third battlefield. Currently, the first battlefield in this county has completed the battle as scheduled, and the second battlefield is underway.
    The development of large-scale cooperation has provided the people with a profound education, enhancing their communist spirit. The old ideas and habits of "each person sweeping the snow from their own doorstep, not caring about the frost on others' roofs" have been swept away. Many urban residents who previously never cared about the countryside have now become active supporters of the countryside. After the Nankang County Party Committee proposed the task of urban support for the rural summer harvest and planting, all urban residents in Nankang County eagerly signed up to participate in the support teams. Business people carried a shoulder pole and a sickle to the fields, saying, "When commune members are producing, I harvest rice; when commune members are resting, I sell goods." They were extremely popular with the commune members. (Liu Guangzhang)

    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) Starting from the evening of July 1st, 6.3 million farmers in Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan, displayed soaring enthusiasm, working hard for five days and nights, excavating more than 140,000 li of canals, enabling more than 82% of the paddy fields in the region to achieve gravity-flow irrigation.
    Shaoyang Prefecture has always been a drought-prone area. Every year, when summer arrives, a large amount of labor is spent on watering and fighting drought. In general drought years, more than 20 million labor days are needed for drought relief, making the labor arrangement for various summer tasks very tight. After the realization of gravity-flow irrigation, the broad masses in the region were greatly encouraged and greatly increased their determination and confidence to further leap forward in agricultural production.

### 调动一切劳力完成夏收夏种任务  江西全面开展大协作

    调动一切劳力完成夏收夏种任务
    江西全面开展大协作
    本报讯　江西省各地以开展共产主义大协作的办法解除劳力不足的困难，保证夏收夏种如期完成。
      “任务重、时间短、要求高”这是江西今年夏收夏种的突出特点。为了取得全年更大丰收，全省二千四百万亩早稻必须在7月底、最迟在8月上旬收割完毕，并要做到细打细收、粒粒还家。早稻割完，二季晚稻插完，晚稻力争超过早稻，中稻要进行最后一把劲的田间管理。此外，还需要抢插红薯等杂粮作物，因而劳力异常不足。
    为了解决这个问题，全省各级党组织于是组织山区与平原、经济作物区与粮食作物区、早熟区与晚熟区、一季稻区与双季稻区、城镇与农村之间开展共产主义大协作，既合理又充分的把一切劳力利用到夏收夏种中来，确保夏收夏种如期完成。赣南行政区从区到社层层成立了协作委员会，专人负责领导和组织区、乡、社之间的协作。吉安专区吉水县夏收夏种任务是在十五到二十天的时间里做到：收割完五十八万亩早稻，栽种二十五万亩蕃薯和密植连作晚稻五万亩、二季晚稻十万亩。而全县劳力却只有九万个，双抢任务十分紧张。但是从地区上来看，水西丘陵地区的十五个乡人多田少，早稻成熟快，又没有种蕃薯的习惯；水东山区二十一个乡人少田多，早稻成熟迟七天，有种蕃薯的习惯。针对这一情况，中共吉水县委便组织这两个地区开展协作：水西丘陵区支援水东山区三十万斤蕃薯苗，水东山区首先支援水西区收种，然后水西丘陵区支援水东山区收种，把所有物质和人力都充分利用了起来。上饶专区广丰县算细账的结果，夏收夏种中缺少九十一万个劳动日，中共广丰县委为此便根据县内平原、丘陵和山区三种地区的早稻成熟迟早不一的情况，划成三个战场；按照社员们技术特长组织割禾、打谷、耕田、插秧、运输等突击队。在第一战场进入战斗时，调第二、第三战场人马助战，最后第一、第二战场调出人马支援第三战场。现在，这个县的第一战场已按期结束了战斗，第二战场正在进行。
    大协作的开展对人们进行了一次深刻的教育，增长了人们的共产主义精神。过去的那种“各人自扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”的旧思想、旧习气一扫而光，许多过去从不过问农村的城镇人们现在变成了支援农村的积极分子。在中共南康县委提出了城镇支援农村夏收夏种的任务后，南康县所有城镇人们都争先报名参加支援大队。商业人员挑着一副担子和一把镰刀到田间，他们说：“社员生产我割禾，社员休息我卖货。”极受社员们欢迎。　　　（刘光障）
    本报讯　从7月1日晚开始，湖南邵阳专区六百三十万农民，发挥冲天干劲，大干五昼夜，开凿渠道十四万多里，使全区82％以上的水田实现了灌溉自流化。
    邵阳专区历来是干旱地区。每年一到夏天就要花费大量劳力车水抗旱，一般旱灾年成也需要抗旱工两千多万个劳动日，使夏季各项工作在劳力安排上非常紧张。水利灌溉自流化实现后，全区广大群众欢欣鼓舞，大大地增加了在农业生产跃进再跃进的决心和信心。
