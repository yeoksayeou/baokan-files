    Beating the Snake Demon (Puppet Play)
    Shěn Mùyín
    Characters: Snake Demon A, Snake Demon B, Arab, People of the World for Peace

      (The curtain opens, snakes dance, transforming into human form)
    Snake A: I am a large python,
      With a fierce nature and a black heart,
      Insatiably eating people, with a huge appetite,
      Drinking up the people's sweat and blood!
      (Turns dejected) Unexpectedly, the world has changed now,
      The people are unwilling to be oppressed,
      Iraq changed in the blink of an eye,
      A republic was established overnight,
      My precious Faisal was removed,
      The Baghdad Pact was dismantled from then on!
      The civil war in Lebanon is fierce,
      Little Chamoun is scared out of his wits!
      If there's another problem in this place,
      I'll simply lose my lifeline!
      Quickly call out my old partner,
      To discuss a good strategy.
        (Shouting inside) Partner, come quickly!
    Snake B: (Darts out, transforming into human form)
      The situation in the Middle East is so dangerous,
      The situation in Iraq has changed,
      The Arab Federation has collapsed,
      Little Hussein is hanging by a thread!
      I wanted to send troops to Jordan,
      But I'm afraid of the Arab people's iron fists!
      I wanted to watch the situation and not get involved,
      But I see our Middle East interests about to be lost!
      It makes me pace around like an ant on a hot pot,
      Mentally disturbed, restless day and night!
      I hear my old partner calling me,
      Right, find him to make a good plan.
        (To A) Partner, hello!
    Snake A: Hello my foot! My neurasthenia is acting up again!
    Snake B: I also have difficulty eating and sleeping, unable to sit or lie still.
    Snake A: The Arabs are hateful!
    Snake B: Daring to oppose us!
    Snake A: It used to be a bit better,
    Snake B: Now they are very tough!
      You and I cannot tolerate it,
      Quickly send troops to the Middle East;
    Snake B: Don't rush! Last time we attacked Egypt,
      We were badly battered!
      I have experience of being beaten,
      Therefore, I am timid and fearful!
    Snake A: If you and I don't take action,
      All Middle East interests will be lost,
      Now regardless of the consequences,
      A cornered dog will jump over the wall!
    Snake B: That's right! I hope God blesses us, that we don't suffer this time!
    Snake A: Since that's the case, you and I will reveal our true forms!
      (Transforms into a snake)
    Snake B: Don't make a sound, crawl to the Middle East to bite people!
      (Transforms into a snake, and exits with A)
      (Arab enters, joyful, dancing)
    Arab: The Middle Eastern people are making revolution,
          Unite to eliminate tyrants,
          Throw off the shackles from our bodies,
          Celebrate the great joy of liberation.
      (Joyful dancing. Snake A darts out, bites one person, Snake B follows, also bites one person, two large snakes attack the Arab. Arab struggles with the snakes. Loud gongs and drums. Peace People enter together.)
    Peace People: Beat the poisonous snakes, beat the poisonous snakes, people all over the world support the Arabs! Fight!
      (Helps the Arab kill the large snakes)
    Peace People: Arab brothers have great skills,
    Arab: Helping all depends on all the villagers,
    Peace People: People all over the world are closely united,
    Arab: Eliminate the poisonous snakes and protect peace!
      (Joyful dancing, the end)

    打蛇妖（木偶剧）
    沈慕垠人物　蛇妖甲、蛇妖乙、阿拉伯人、世界和平人民
      （幕开，跳蛇，变化为人形）蛇甲：我是一条大蟒蛇，
      性情凶暴心肠黑，
      吃人无厌胃口大，
      喝尽人民的汗和血！
      （转懊丧）不料如今世道变，
      人民不甘受压迫，
      伊拉克眨个眼睛就变卦，
      一夜成立了共和国，
      把我的宝贝费萨尔除掉了，
      巴格达条约从此把台拆！
      黎巴嫩内战打得凶，
      夏蒙小子吓得失魂又掉魄！
      倘若是这个地方再出岔，
      我简直弄得没命脉！
      快快叫出老伙计，
      商量一个好对策。
        （向内喊）伙计，快来啊！蛇乙：（窜出，变化人形）中东局势好凶险，
      伊拉克国内变了天，
      伊约联邦垮了杆，
      侯赛因娃娃悬又悬！
      我本想派兵到约旦，
      又害怕阿拉伯人的大铁拳！
      我本想看看火色不忙管，
      眼看着中东利益要丢完！
      弄得我热锅上蚂蚁团团转，
      精神恍惚日夜不安！
      耳听得老伙计在把我喊，
      对，找他来打个好算盘。
        （向甲）伙计，你好！蛇甲：好个屁！我的神经衰弱病又发了！蛇乙：我也是茶饭难咽，坐卧不宁，蛇甲：阿拉伯人可恨！蛇乙：胆敢反对我们！蛇甲：从前都还好点，蛇乙：现在十分强硬！
      你我不能容忍，
      快向中东派兵；蛇乙：莫忙啊！前次进攻埃及，
      碰得头破流血！
      我有挨打经验，
      因此心惊胆怯！蛇甲：你我若不动手，
      中东利益全丢，
      现在不管后果，
      狗急跳过墙头！蛇乙：对嘛！但愿上帝保佑，这回不吃苦头！蛇甲：既然如此，我你二人现原形！　（变蛇）蛇乙：莫要声张，爬到中东去咬人！
      （变蛇，与甲同下）
      （阿拉伯人上，欢乐，舞蹈）阿拉伯人：中东人民闹革命，
          团结起来除暴君，
          身上枷锁齐打掉，
          庆贺翻身大欢腾。
      （欢乐舞蹈。蛇甲窜出，咬一口，蛇乙随后出，也咬一口，两条大蛇向阿拉伯人进攻。阿拉伯人与蛇搏斗。大锣鼓。和平人民齐出。）和平人民：打毒蛇，打毒蛇，全世界人民支援阿拉伯！打呀！
      （帮助阿拉伯人打死大蛇）和平人民：阿拉伯兄弟好本领，阿拉伯人：帮忙全靠众乡亲，和平人民：全世界人民团结紧，阿拉伯人：除尽毒蛇保和平！
      （欢舞，闭幕）
