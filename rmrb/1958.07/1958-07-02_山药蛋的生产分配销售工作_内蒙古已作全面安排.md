Inner Mongolia has Fully Arranged the Production, Allocation and Sales of Potatoes
According to the Inner Mongolia Daily News: The People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region convened a meeting of league and banner (county) heads in Hohhot on June 18 to specifically arrange the region's yam production, sales, and distribution work for this year.

The meeting held that at present, special efforts should be made in the field management and autumn harvest of planted yams, and all effective measures should be taken to strive to increase yield per unit area, and to guarantee a bumper harvest of yams in every possible way.

The meeting decided to purchase the surplus yams from rural areas, including fresh yams, dried yams, and starch, using a combination of unified purchase with grain and unified purchase methods. The unified purchase targets will be allocated to the societies together with the grain contracting tasks. Surplus yams after the unified purchase will be purchased by the state in a unified manner, but consumers and producers will also be allowed to trade freely in the market. The meeting held that the purchase and sale prices of yams should be based on reasonable grain-to-potato price ratios to ensure that the income from planting yams is not lower than that of planting local staple grain seeds.

The meeting requested that all localities adopt the following measures for rural yam consumption: in areas where the grain ration includes potatoes, the state's grain retention quota for agricultural societies will remain unchanged, and societies can distribute more potatoes to members in their grain ration to free up grain for the society's reserves; in areas where the grain ration does not include potatoes, if local production and sales are balanced with a surplus, the league people's committee can consider stipulating a corresponding amount of potato retention for members' rations; in areas where production is insufficient for sales, or where yams are only used as a side dish, a potato retention quota may not be set. In cities and towns, a portion of fresh yams or dried yams and starch should be appropriately included in the grain rations of government agencies, troops, enterprises, organizations, schools, and residents in the future. Industrial and trade grain consumption in cities and towns must also be appropriately supplemented to reduce the state's grain supply burden.

After repeated study, the meeting decided that yam storage work should follow the principle of "mainly decentralized and small-quantity storage, supplemented by national and centralized storage" proposed by Shanxi Province, with relevant departments and agricultural societies responsible for storage. The specific requirements are that dried yams and starch should be stored by the departments responsible for their management, and fresh yams should be stored by agricultural societies through phased deliveries, with the state compensating the agricultural societies for storage costs and losses. For transportation, all localities should organize and utilize local transportation capacity in a timely manner according to the early or late harvest season in their area, and properly transport the yams to the designated locations. The processing of dried yams and starch should mainly rely on agricultural societies, with the state only organizing necessary processing based on production and sales. At the same time, small processing plants should be set up appropriately and dispersedly in some market towns in producing areas. Both state and agricultural society processing should promote comprehensive utilization.

    山药蛋的生产分配销售工作
    内蒙古已作全面安排
    据内蒙古日报讯　内蒙古自治区人民委员会，6月18日在呼和浩特召集各盟、旗（县）长开会，具体布置了全区今年山药蛋产销分配工作。
    会议认为：目前应特别做好已种山药蛋的田间管理和秋收工作，采取一切有效措施，力争提高单位面积产量，千方百计地保证山药蛋的丰收。
    会议确定收购农村剩余的山药蛋，包括鲜山药蛋、山药蛋干和淀粉，采取随粮统购和统一收购的两种办法。统购指标将与粮食包干任务统一分配到社。统购以后的剩余山药蛋，由国家统一收购，但也允许消费者与生产者在市场上自由进行交易。会议认为山药蛋的购销价格，应该根据粮薯合理比价，保证种山药蛋不低于种当地主食粮种的收益。
    会议要求各地对农村用薯应采取：凡口粮标准内含薯的地区，国家对农业社的粮食留量不变，社对社员的口粮用薯可以多分一些，以顶出粮食做为社的贮备；凡口粮标准内没有含薯的地区，如当地产销平衡有余，社员的口粮可由盟人民委员会考虑规定相当的留薯数量；凡产不足销的地区，或只以山药蛋做副食的地区，可以不定留薯数量。在城镇，对机关、部队、企业团体、学校和居民的口粮，今后要适当搭配一部分鲜山药蛋或山药蛋干、淀粉。对城镇工业用粮和行业用粮，也必须适当搭配，以减轻国家的粮食供应负担。
    经过反复研究后，会议决定山药蛋保管工作要参照山西省提出的“以分散和小量保管为主，国家和集中保管为辅”的方针，由各有关部门和农业社分工负责保管。具体要求是，山药蛋干、淀粉按经营分工负责保管，鲜山药蛋通过分期送交的办法，依靠农业社保管，国家补偿农业社的保管费用和损耗。运输工作，各地应根据当地收获季节的迟早，及时组织与利用当地运输力量，妥善地把山药蛋运送到指定地点。山药蛋干、淀粉的加工工作以依靠农业社为主，国家只根据产销情况组织必要的加工。同时，应在某些产地集镇市场，适当分散地设小型加工厂。国家与农业社加工，都应提倡综合利用。
