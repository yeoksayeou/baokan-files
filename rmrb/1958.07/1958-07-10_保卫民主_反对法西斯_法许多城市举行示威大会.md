Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 8th: Tens of thousands of Republicans, responding to the call of the French Communist Party, held demonstrations in many major French cities on the 6th to express their determination to defend democratic republicanism.

	A rally of 12,000 people was held in Le Havre, attended by Léon Feix, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. A rally of several thousand people was held in Grenoble, attended by Communist Secretary Duclos. In addition, a rally of 12,000 people was held in Toulouse; rallies of 10,000 people were held in Fougarolles and Nîmes; and grand gatherings were also held in Montluçon, Agondange, and Rommen.

	These large-scale demonstrations demonstrate the widespread influence and high prestige of the French Communist Party. These very enthusiastic gatherings also demonstrate the power of the people's movement to defend the Republic and oppose de Gaulle's attempt to establish a complete dictatorship through a referendum.

	Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 8th: The movement to defend the Republic is unfolding throughout France.

	Recently, a committee to defend the Republic was established in the city of Menesplet in the Dordogne province. Participating in this committee are local organizations of political parties and groups such as the French National Peace Council, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, the French General Confederation of Labor, the Secular Affairs Federation, the Retired Railway Employees Federation, and the National Teachers' Union.

	The committee called on all Republicans in Menesplet to gather in front of the monument to the fallen martyrs on July 14th—French National Day—to lay wreaths at the monument.

	The students of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Socialist Left League in Nancy issued an appeal calling on all Republicans to unite. The 13th Teachers' Congress of the Bouches-du-Rhône held in Marseille also unanimously passed a resolution calling on all Republicans without exception to unite to defend freedom and oppose de Gaulle's conspiracy to establish a complete dictatorship through a referendum.

    法许多城市举行示威大会
    新华社巴黎8日电  数以万计的共和人士响应法国共产党的号召，6日在法国的许多大城市里举行了示威大会，以表示他们捍卫民主共和的决心。
    在哈佛尔举行了一万二千人的大会，法国共产党中央委员会委员莱昂·弗克斯参加了这个大会；在格累诺布尔举行的好几千人的大会，共产党书记杜克洛参加了这个大会。此外，在都鲁斯举行了一万二千人的大会；弗加罗勒和尼姆举行了一万人的大会，在蒙律松、阿贡达格和罗门也举行了盛大的集会。
    这些声势浩大的示威大会表明了法国共产党的广泛影响和崇高的威信。这些十分热烈的集会也表明了保卫共和国和反对戴高乐企图通过公民投票来建立完全的独裁的人民运动所具有的威力。
    据新华社巴黎8日电  保卫共和国的运动正在法国普遍展开。
    最近在多顿涅省的默纳斯普累市建立了一个保卫共和国委员会，参加这个委员会的有法国全国和平理事会、共产党、社会党、激进社会党、法国总工会、世俗事业联合会、退休铁路员工联合会以及全国教师工会等政党和团体的地方组织。
    委员会号召默纳斯普累市的所有共和人士7月14日——法国国庆日——聚会在死难烈士纪念碑面前，向烈士纪念碑献花圈。
    南锡的共产党、社会党、激进社会党和社会主义左翼联盟的学生们发出呼吁，要求一切共和人士团结起来。在马赛举行的罗尼河口省第十三次教师代表大会也一致通过决议，号召一切共和人士毫无例外地团结起来保卫自由，并且反对戴高乐要通过公民投票以建立完全独裁的阴谋。
