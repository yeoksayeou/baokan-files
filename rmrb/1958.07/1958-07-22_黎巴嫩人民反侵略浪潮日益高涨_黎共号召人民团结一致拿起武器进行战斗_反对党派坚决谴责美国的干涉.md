Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 21st - Damascus' "Al-Nour" reported today that the Lebanese Communist Party has issued a statement strongly condemning the illegal and open aggression of the US military against Lebanon, and called on the people to unite and take up arms to fight and drive the US aggressors out of Lebanon.

The statement said that the barbarians of the twentieth century - the US imperialist army - have invaded the beloved land of Lebanon. They have assembled fleets and aircraft, and landed in droves on the Lebanese coast, "in order to put out the sacred uprising of our people, destroy the independence of Lebanon, and support the rule of traitors Chamoun, Solh, and Malik, who, with the support of the National Socialist Party and the Phalange Party traitors, oppress the people and cause them to bleed, so as to make Lebanon an appendage of imperialism and a base for conspiracies and aggressions against sister countries."

The statement added, "The purpose of the Americans occupying Lebanon, the British occupying Jordan, and the French rushing to send fleets to Beirut is to invade the Iraqi people in the second stage, attack the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic, and avenge the disastrous defeat they suffered in their perfidious aggression against Egypt."

The statement pointed out that the US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has created a new danger of war threatening the whole world. Today, the whole world is watching us.

The statement said, "Let us unite today, regardless of tendencies, sects, or classes, and regardless of views on this or that issue of Lebanese internal affairs. Let us unite, let us strengthen the unity of our national ranks, in order to expel the interfering enemies, smash their aggression, and eliminate their fifth column - those whom they have bought. For the supreme interests of the motherland, the interests of Lebanon, its existence and destiny, we must unite."

The statement then called on men, women, youth, and children all over the country: "Use any weapons you have to fight the greedy aggressors. Wherever you see them, kill them, use your guns and machine-gun bullets to kill them. Throw your bombs at them, hit them with anything you can get your hands on, bite them with your teeth, so that they live in hell on our free land, so that they will leave here defeated and in despair."

The statement said that the imperialists are isolated. The forces of justice and freedom everywhere in the world stand on the side of the Lebanese people. "Final victory must be ours, and US imperialism and its agents will meet a shameful end."

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - TASS, London, 21st: The "News Chronicle" published a conversation between the newspaper's Beirut correspondent, Barber, and the leader of the Lebanese insurgents, Salam. Salam told Barber, "The aggressors should leave Lebanese territory. If they don't, we will fight." Salam also said, "We are not against the West, we are not communists. It's all propaganda. We are willing to be a bridge between the Arab world and the rest of the world, but we are not willing to be a stepping stone for the West. Therefore, we oppose Chamoun, who is a puppet of the imperialists, and he wants to turn us into puppets as well. We should remain neutral."

Xinhua News Agency, 21st - London Dispatch: The London "Observer" published on the 20th a dispatch from its correspondent in Beirut, acknowledging that the US military's invasion of Lebanon has not only failed to intimidate the opposition parties but has instead strengthened their determination to oppose imperialism and its agents. The dispatch said that the main political effect of the US military landing in Lebanon has been to make the forces opposing the Chamoun regime more united and resolute.

The dispatch also said that in the past, the opposition united only to oppose the Chamoun regime, but now they are also united in condemning US aggression.

At the same time, a United Press International dispatch from Cairo on the 20th also acknowledged that the US and British invasion of Lebanon and Jordan "has stimulated Arab nationalism to a fever pitch."

    黎巴嫩人民反侵略浪潮日益高涨
    黎共号召人民团结一致拿起武器进行战斗
    反对党派坚决谴责美国的干涉
    新华社大马士革21日电  大马士革“光明报”今天报道，黎巴嫩共产党发表了声明，严厉谴责美国军队对黎巴嫩的非法公开侵略，并且号召人民团结一致，拿起武器，进行战斗，把美国侵略者赶出黎巴嫩。
    声明说，二十世纪的野蛮人——美帝国主义军队，已经侵入黎巴嫩的可爱国土，他们集结了舰队和飞机，成群结队地在黎巴嫩海岸登陆，“以便扑灭我国人民神圣的起义、破坏黎巴嫩的独立和支持卖国贼夏蒙、索勒哈和马利克的统治，这些卖国贼在国家社会党和长枪党叛徒的支持下欺压人民，使人民血流成河，以便使黎巴嫩成为帝国主义的仆从和对各地姊妹国家进行阴谋活动和侵略的基地。”
    声明又说，“占领黎巴嫩的美国人、占领约旦的英国人和急忙派遣舰队到贝鲁特来的法国人的目的，都是想在第二阶段侵略伊拉克人民，进攻阿拉伯联合共和国的叙利亚地区，并且想为他们对埃及的背信弃义的侵略所遭到的惨败复仇。”
    声明指出，由于美英对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略已经产生了威胁全世界的新战争危险。今天全世界都注视着我们。
    声明说，“让我们今天团结起来，不分倾向、教派或阶级，不管黎巴嫩内政的这一问题或那一问题的看法如何。让我们团结起来，让我们加强我们民族队伍的团结，以便驱逐进行干涉的敌人，粉碎他们的侵略，消灭他们的第五纵队——他们收买的人。为了祖国的最高利益、黎巴嫩的利益、它的存在和命运，我们必须团结起来。”
    声明随后号召全国各地的男人、妇女、青年和儿童：“用你们拥有的任何武器同贪婪的侵略者进行斗争。无论在那里，你们一看到他们，就把他们杀死，用你们的枪炮和机关枪的子弹来打死他们。把你们的炸弹投向他们，用你们手上拿到的任何东西来打他们，用你们的牙齿把他们咬碎，使他们在我们的自由土地上就像生活在地狱里一样，这样他们就会失败地和绝望地离开这里。”
    声明说，帝国主义者是孤立的。世界上一切地方的正义和自由的力量都站在黎巴嫩人民一边，“最后的胜利一定是我们的，而美帝国主义和它的代理人将遭到可耻的结局。”
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社伦敦21日讯：“新闻纪事报”刊登了这家报纸驻贝鲁特记者巴伯尔同黎巴嫩起义者领袖萨拉姆的谈话。萨拉姆向巴伯尔说，“侵略者应当离开黎巴嫩领土。如果他们不这样做，我们将进行战斗。”萨拉姆还说，“我们不反对西方，我们不是共产党。这一切都是宣传。我们愿意成为阿拉伯同其他世界之间的桥梁，但是我们不愿意成为西方的跳板。因此我们反对夏蒙，他是帝国主义者的傀儡，他还想把我们也变成傀儡。我们应当保持中立。”
    新华社21日讯  伦敦消息：伦敦“观察家报”在20日发表的它的记者从贝鲁特发出的消息承认，美国军队侵入黎巴嫩之后，不但没有吓倒反对党派，而且反而使他们反对帝国主义和它的代理人的态度更加坚决。消息说，美军在黎巴嫩登陆在政治上的主要效果是使得反对夏蒙政权的力量更加结团一致，而且态度更坚定。
    消息还说，在以前，反对派团结起来只是为了反对夏蒙政权，而现在它们还团结起来谴责美国的侵略。
    同时，合众国际社20日从开罗发出的一条消息也承认，美英两国侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的行动“已经把阿拉伯民族主义刺激到白热化的程度”。
