Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 27th: Yesterday in Hangzhou, thousands upon thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate, protesting against US imperialism’s instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to create tension in the Taiwan area. They shouted: "US Imperialism, get out of our Taiwan!" "We must liberate Taiwan, we will not stop until our goal is achieved!" The demonstrators also performed street dramas depicting the various ugly behaviors of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, such as "Dying Struggle," "Ugly Dance of Demons," and "A Clay Bodhisattva Crossing the River."

Many factories, government offices, schools, hospitals, residential areas, and other units in Hangzhou held protest rallies yesterday. At the meetings, people resolutely stated their readiness to contribute to the liberation of Taiwan at any time. Many people denounced the oppression and humiliation of the Chinese people by US imperialism before liberation and the suffering inflicted on the people by its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Mining worker Huang Chengshan and others pointed out that our strength is unparalleled. The Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the direction of US imperialism, is妄想妄想 to take advantage of the opportunity when American and British aggressors are setting fires in the Middle East. This is a daydream.

Young students, women, and demobilized soldiers at the rallies all expressed their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and contribute to the liberation of Taiwan. Demobilized soldiers such as Niu Dengxian, who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island on the Zhejiang front, had shot down American planes, captured American devils, and severely attacked Chiang Kai-shek's army in the past. They said that US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are both defeated soldiers at our hands. Now they dare to provoke us, they will only bring about their own destruction. Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Hangzhou area also held many rallies, demanding that a head-on blow be resolutely given to any enemies who dare to invade, and that training be intensified to prepare for the liberation of Taiwan at any time.

    抗议美蒋制造紧张局势
    杭州群众举行大示威
    新华社杭州27日电　杭州市昨天有成千上万的人到街头举行示威，抗议美帝国主义指使蒋介石集团在台湾地区制造紧张局势。他们高呼：“美帝国主义从我国台湾滚出去！”“我们一定要解放台湾，不达目的决不罢休！”示威者还在街头演出了描绘蒋介石集团各种丑态的“垂死挣扎”“群魔丑舞”和“泥菩萨过河”等活报剧。
    杭州市的许多工厂、机关、学校、医院、居民区等昨天都举行了抗议集会。人们在会上坚决表示随时准备为解放台湾而贡献力量。许多人控诉了美帝国主义在解放前压迫、侮辱我国人民以及它的走狗蒋介石集团给予人民的痛苦。采矿工黄承善等指出，我们的力量无比强大，蒋介石集团在美帝国主义指使下妄想在美英侵略者在中东放火的机会趁火打劫，这是白天做梦。
    青年学生、妇女和复员军人在集会上都表示随时准备着响应祖国召唤，为解放台湾而贡献力量。曾参加过抗美援朝和浙江前线解放一江山岛之战的复员军人牛登仙等，过去曾打下过美国飞机和活捉过美国鬼子，痛击过蒋介石军队。他们说，美帝国主义和蒋介石集团都是我们的手下败兵，现在胆敢来进行挑衅，那只会自取灭亡。杭州地区的中国人民解放军官兵也举行了许多集会，他们要求坚决给予胆敢来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，并要加紧训练，随时做好解放台湾的一切准备。
