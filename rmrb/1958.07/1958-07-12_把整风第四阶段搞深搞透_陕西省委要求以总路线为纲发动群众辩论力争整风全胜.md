Carry out the fourth stage of rectification in a deep and thorough way
The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee requires to launch mass debate with the general line as the guiding principle and strive for complete victory in the rectification campaign.

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 11th dispatch) At a meeting of responsible persons from relevant provincial departments held on the 9th, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee demanded that all organs immediately and deeply mobilize the masses, take the Party's general line for socialist construction as the guiding principle, carry out the fourth stage of the rectification campaign deeply and thoroughly, and achieve complete victory.

Although the rectification movement in Shaanxi's provincial-level organs has now entered its fourth stage, some organs' leaders lack a deep understanding of rectification as the key to all work and have relaxed the rectification movement by emphasizing the busyness of work; some leading cadres lack sufficient determination and consciousness to improve their own ideology and work style; some people overestimate the achievements already made in the rectification movement and have become complacent and relaxed. As a result, the fourth stage of rectification in these organs has not been carried out well, and some units even want to end it hastily.

Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, pointed out at the meeting that the rectification movement must have a good beginning and a good end. Although the results of the rectification movement are significant, some organs have consciously or unconsciously improved certain aspects of their work under the wave of mass movements, and therefore the changes are not thorough; some organs have not yet properly solved the problem of "politics in command" and have not deeply recognized the importance of "theoretical work" ideologically. There are also some units that are content to remain in the middle, not fully motivated, and hesitate when encountering specific problems instead of trying their best to promote progress. Therefore, those who overestimate the achievements of rectification have no basis.

Zhao Boping pointed out that the fourth stage of rectification is an important stage that determines the complete victory of rectification, and it is also an important stage for consolidating, improving, and developing the achievements of the rectification movement. To this end, all organs must have their leaders take the lead, immediately and earnestly mobilize the masses, and quickly push the fourth stage of rectification to a climax. All units should continue to organize cadres to conscientiously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and Chairman Mao's documents such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to improve their thinking. Continue to launch a great contending, great blooming, and great debate, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, examine the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction: Is it more, faster, better, and more economical, or less, slower, worse, and more expensive? Is it striving for advancement or content with lagging behind? Is it a great leap forward or gradual progress? Is it boldly creating and innovating, or sticking to old ways? Is it fully mobilizing the masses and following the mass line, or the opposite? We must fully promote the atmosphere of "discussing theory." All organs should, according to their specific circumstances, launch debates on major issues, clarify and thoroughly debate them, and earnestly achieve putting politics in command, so that everyone's awareness is raised and everyone is given a red flag. All organs should mobilize the masses to repeatedly deliberate and discuss the rectification summary, and everyone should offer opinions. Absolutely no one should be allowed to take over on behalf of the masses. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the masses be fully utilized, so that the fourth stage of rectification can be done well and complete victory in the rectification movement can be achieved.

The meeting emphasized that the characteristic of the fourth stage of rectification is a mass-based, conscious ideological revolution movement. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to deeply mobilize the masses, and leaders must focus on this work in the near future, carrying out the fourth stage of rectification deeply and thoroughly. On the basis of the complete victory of the rectification movement, it is necessary to universally advocate and organize cadres to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works in order to continue to improve ideological understanding, consolidate the achievements of rectification, and further develop the technological revolution and cultural revolution.

### 把整风第四阶段搞深搞透  陕西省委要求以总路线为纲发动群众辩论力争整风全胜

    把整风第四阶段搞深搞透
    陕西省委要求以总路线为纲发动群众辩论力争整风全胜
    本报西安11日电　中共陕西省委在9日召开的省级各有关部门负责人的会议上，要求各机关立即深入发动群众，以党的社会主义建设总路线为纲，把整风第四阶段搞深搞透，取得全胜。
    陕西省级机关的整风运动目前虽已进入第四阶段，但是由于有些机关的领导人对整风是提起一切工作的纲缺乏深刻认识，强调工作繁忙而放松了整风运动；有些领导干部对改进本身的思想作风缺乏足够的决心和自觉性；有些人对整风运动已取得的成果估计过高，产生了松劲自满情绪。因而这些机关整风第四阶段的工作搞得不好，有些单位甚至想草率收场。
    中共陕西省委书记处书记赵伯平在会上指出，整风运动必须善始善终，整风运动的成果虽然很大，但是有些机关是在群众运动的浪潮促使下才自觉地或不自觉地改进了某些工作，因此改得不彻底；有些机关还没有好好解决“政治挂帅”的问题，还没有从思想上深刻地认识到“务虚”的重要意义。还有一些单位甘居中游，干劲没有鼓足，在碰到具体问题时不是尽力促进，而是犹豫动摇。因此，那些对于整风成果做过高估计的人是没有根据的。
    赵伯平指出：整风第四阶段是决定整风全胜的重要阶段，也是巩固、提高和发展整风运动成果的重要阶段。为此，各机关必须领导挂帅，立即认真发动群众，迅速把整风第四阶段推向高峰。各单位应继续组织干部认真学习党的八大二次会议文件和毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等文件，以提高思想。继续展开大鸣大放大辩论，用批评和自我批评的武器，检查贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的情况，是多快好省，还是少慢差费？是力争上游，还是甘居下游？是大跃进，还是渐进？是大胆创造革新，还是因循守旧？是充分发动群众走群众路线，还是相反？要充分发扬“论虚”的风气。各机关应根据具体情况，对重大问题展开辩论，辩明辩透，切实做到政治挂帅，达到人人提高觉悟个个插上红旗。各机关都应发动群众反复酝酿和讨论整风总结，人人提意见，绝不能几个人包办代替，只有这样才能充分发挥群众的积极性，使得整风第四阶段能够做好，取得整风运动的全胜。
    会议强调指出：整风第四阶段的特点是一个群众性的自觉的思想革命运动。因此必须继续深入发动群众，领导要在最近期间狠狠抓这一工作，把整风第四阶段搞深搞透。在整风运动全胜的基础上，普遍提倡和组织干部学习毛泽东同志的著作，以继续提高思想认识，巩固整风成果，使技术革命和文化革命进一步开展起来。
