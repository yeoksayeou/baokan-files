Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 14th: The reconstruction project of the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway has been basically completed. This 509-kilometer-long railway can now run large locomotives and haul longer freight trains. Compared with before the reconstruction, its transportation volume has increased by more than five times in daily freight tonnage and seven times in passenger volume. The reconstruction of this railway section began in 1956 and was completed without interrupting transportation. The earth and stone excavation and disposal for the reconstruction project totaled more than 5,467,000 cubic meters, which is almost the same amount of work as building a new line of the same length.

A second phase of technical renovation, including electrification, is planned for this railway in the future.

    陇海路宝兰段改建完工
    据新华社西安14日电　陇海铁路宝（鸡）兰（州）段的改建工程已经基本完工。这段长达五百零九公里的铁路，现在已能行驶大型机车，编挂较长的货物列车。它的运输量同改建前比较，每天货运吨数提高了五倍多，客运量增加七倍。这段铁路的改建工程从1956年开始，是在不间断运输的情况下完成的。改建工程开挖和填弃的土石方共达五百四十六万七千多立方公尺，同新建一条同样线路花的力量差不多。
    这段铁路将来还计划进行第二期技术改造，实行电气化。
