Xinhua News Agency, July 18th—From 13:25 Beijing time, the front of the British Representative Office in China was crowded with demonstrators. They held up placards with slogans such as "Oppose U.S. and British Interference in the Internal Affairs of Arab Countries," demanding that American troops get out of Lebanon and British troops get out of Jordan. As of the time of dispatch, nearly 50,000 people from over a hundred schools and enterprises had demonstrated in front of the British Representative Office, and the tide of people is continuing to pour in from all directions.

The demonstrators read out protest letters to the U.S. and British governments on the stone benches in front of the British Representative Office, and some handed the protest letters to the staff of the British Representative Office. The demonstrators waved their fists and small flags with slogans, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the U.S. Armed Aggression against Lebanon!" "U.S. Troops Get Out of Lebanon!" "Oppose the British Armed Aggression against Jordan!" "British Troops Get Out of Jordan!" The gate of the Representative Office and the walls on both sides of the courtyard were simultaneously plastered and covered with slogans by the demonstrators.

Yesterday, 500,000 people in Beijing held rallies and demonstrations against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Lebanon. When they saw the news of the British troops' invasion of Jordan in the newspaper today, they were even more angered by the U.S. and British crimes of interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries and creating a war crisis in the Middle East. Many factories, schools, government agencies, organizations, and street residents held protest rallies and then went to the British Representative Office in China to demonstrate.

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th—Although night has fallen, there are more and more people in Beijing demonstrating against the U.S. and British imperialism's aggression against the Middle East. By 20:00 this evening, another 100,000 demonstrators had marched past the front of the British Representative Office in China.

Now, the gate and walls of the Representative Office are covered with thick layers of slogans and cartoons. Two students from Beijing Normal University stood on the shoulders of other students and hung a cartoon of "U.S. and British Troops Get Out of the Middle East" on the wall. The trees and utility poles outside the gate were also covered with countless slogans and cartoons. The demonstrators from Peking University sang their self-composed song "U.S. and British Imperialism's Heinous Crimes" and stopped in front of the Representative Office for five minutes. Student representative Li Mingquan rolled up his sleeves, revealing his right arm, which had been wounded in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. He puffed out his chest, waved his left arm, and said passionately to the staff of the British Representative Office: We competed with you in Korea, and we won, and you lost! We love peace, but we are not afraid of war! We will not allow you to interfere in the internal affairs of Arab countries, and we want your invading troops to get out of Arab land immediately! The two British people standing at the gate of the Representative Office lowered their heads and dared not look him in the eye.

Teachers and students from the Foreign Affairs College broadcast their protest letter in English, warning the British government that following the American aggressors would not bring any benefit other than digging their own graves. Two students, dressed as heroic Arabs, led two dejected American and British soldiers, and came to the front of the Representative Office amid slogans that lasted for several minutes. The students told the staff of the British Representative Office that this is the fate of the aggressors. After learning of the British troops' invasion of Jordan, students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts immediately drew hundreds of propaganda paintings, and they carried more than 150 large paintings past the front of the British Representative Office. Nan Bo, a student from the affiliated middle school of the Academy, drew a pencil drawing in front of the British Representative Office in two minutes, depicting the image of awakened Arabs severing the imperialist chains of aggression in the Middle East. After finishing the drawing, he glared with angry eyes and handed the drawing to the staff of the Representative Office.

Wang Wei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, Zhu Liang, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, walked at the front of the demonstrators from these three units. Wang Wei excitedly raised his arms and led the crowd in chanting: "U.S. Troops Get Out of Lebanon!" "British Troops Get Out of Jordan!" All the staff of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote in their protest letter: "We will do everything in our power to support the Arab people's struggle for national independence. If the U.S. and British invading troops do not get out of Lebanon and Jordan, the Arab people and the people of the world will surely send you to your graves!"

Now, government cadres and workers after work are gathering on East and West Chang'an Avenue and Tiananmen Square, and they are starting to walk towards the front of the Representative Office to demonstrate.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th, 23:00—Angry crowds continue to pour towards the front of the British Representative Office like a tidal wave. The demonstrations against the U.S. and British aggression in the Middle East by the people of the capital are still underway tonight. As of 23:00 Beijing time, more than 200,000 workers, government cadres, students, and citizens from all directions have taken to the streets to demonstrate.

The marching队伍 raised torches, and people forgot the fatigue of the day, rushing from the suburbs to the city, raising their arms and shouting "U.S. and British Imperialism Get Out of the Middle East!" Countless cartoons and protest slogans were plastered layer upon layer on the buildings on both sides of the road, which is several miles long, where the British Representative Office is located. Several staff members of the British Representative Office, standing in front of the gate of the British Representative Office to receive the protest letters, looked embarrassed.

More than 1,400 workers from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant had just finished their shift and rushed to the front of the British Representative Office from the eastern suburbs to demonstrate without taking off their work clothes. Tian Junling, a worker from the Beijing Joint State-Private Automotive Parts Factory and a model worker of the city, walked to the two British people who were receiving the protest letters, raised his fist and said: You must quickly tell the British government to let your troops get out of Jordan. Chinese workers have great power, and the people of Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq have the same power as us. If you do not get out of Jordan, we will crush you to pieces. Tian Junling finally asked a staff member of the British Representative Office, "Do you understand?" The British man lowered his head and repeatedly said, "Understand," "Understand."

Many cadres from central and municipal departments in Beijing also flocked to the streets after work and joined the march. Six hundred design workers from the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau's Design Institute were very angry when they heard the news of the British troops landing in Jordan yesterday and wrote more than 1,000 big-character posters protesting against British imperialism's aggression overnight. Today, they all came to the front of the British Representative Office to demonstrate. Zhang Lin, Deputy Procurator of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Procuratorate of Hebei Province, who lost a leg in the Liberation War, came to the gate of the British Representative Office with the crowd,拄着 two crutches. He came from Tianjin to Beijing to attend a meeting. He敲着 the ground with his crutches and shouted at the British "U.S. and Britain Get Out of Lebanon and Jordan! Get Out!"

Many housewives also angrily came to the front of the British Representative Office to express their determination to defend peace. In the 600-person march in Erlong Road, Xicheng District, Wang Yutian, the 43-year-old deputy director of the street women's federation, once organized women to make more than 10,000 sets of military uniforms for the front-line volunteer soldiers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Today, she expressed her intention to support the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle with all her strength, just as she supported her Korean brothers and sisters.

The night is deep, and the crowd holding torches is still pouring towards the British Representative Office. People warn the imperialists that if they do not withdraw their claws of aggression, they will be burned to ashes in the raging fire.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th, 24:00—It is now midnight, and the demonstrating masses in Beijing are still continuing to march towards the British Representative Office in China. Many factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations are holding meetings overnight to condemn and protest against the United States and Britain's interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. After the meetings, people took the protest letters passed by collective discussion to the streets to march and demonstrate.

    新华社18日讯　从北京时间十三点二十五分起，英国驻中国代办处门前拥满了示威的人群。他们高举着“反对美英干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政”等标语牌，要求美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去，英国军队从约旦滚出去。截至发电时止，已有上百个学校、企业单位近五万人在英国代办处门前进行了示威，像潮水般的人群，现在正继续从四面八方拥向英国代办处。
    示威的人们在英国代办处大门前的石凳上宣读了对美英两国政府的抗议书，有的把抗议书交给了英国代办处的工作人员。示威的人们挥动着拳头和写着标语的小旗，高呼“反对美国武装侵略黎巴嫩！”“美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“反对英国武装侵略约旦！”“英国军队从约旦滚出去！”等口号。代办处的大门和两侧的院墙上，同时被示威的人们张贴和写满了标语。
    北京市有五十万人昨天举行了反对美帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩的集会和示威游行。当他们今天从报纸上看到英国军队侵入约旦的消息后，对美、英两国干涉阿拉伯各国人民内政和在中东制造战争危机的罪恶行动，更加愤怒，很多工厂、学校、机关、团体和街道居民纷纷举行抗议集会，并且接着就到英国驻中国代办处去进行示威。
    新华社18日讯　夜幕虽然已经降临，北京为反对美英帝国主义侵略中东而进行示威的人们却越来越多。到今晚二十时止，又有十万名左右的示威群众走过英国驻华代办处的门前。
    现在，这个代办处的大门和墙壁上已经重重叠叠地贴了一层厚厚的际语和漫画。北京师范大学两个学生站在其他学生的肩上，把一幅“美、英军队从中东滚出去”的漫画挂在墙上。大门外的树上、电线杆上，也贴满和挂满了无数的标语和漫画。北京大学的示威群众，高唱他们自编的“美英帝国主义罪恶滔天”的歌子，在代办处门外停了五分钟。学生代表李明权挽起袖子，露出曾在抗美援朝战争中负过伤的右臂，他挺起胸脯，挥着左臂，慷慨激昂地对英国代办处的工作人员说：我们在朝鲜和你们较量过，我们胜利了，你们失败了！我们爱和平，但也不怕战争！我们不允许你们干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政，我们要你们的侵略军立即从阿拉伯的土地上滚出去！站在代办处门口的两个英国人，低着头，不敢正视他一眼。
    外交学院的教师和学生用英语广播了他们的抗议书，他们警告英国政府说，你们跟着美国侵略者走，除了为自己掘墓以外，绝不可能得到任何其他好处。学生们化妆的两个雄赳赳的阿拉伯人，牵着两个垂头丧气的美国兵和英国兵，在延续达几分钟的口号声中来到了代办处门前。学生们告诉英国代办处的人员说，这就是侵略者的下场。中央美术学院的学生在知道英军侵入约旦的消息后，立即画了几百幅宣传画，他们抬着其中一百五十多幅大型画走过英国代办处的门前，这个学院附属中学的学生南博在英国代办处门前用两分钟的时间画了一幅铅笔画，描绘着觉醒了的阿拉伯人斩断帝国主义在中东的侵略锁链的形象。他在画完后，瞪着两只愤怒的眼睛，把画交给了代办处的工作人员。
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记王伟、中华全国青年联合会副秘书长朱良和中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立走在这三个单位示威群众的最前面，王伟激动地举起双臂领导群众高呼：“美国军队从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国军队从约旦滚出去！”团中央全体工作人员在抗议书中写道：“我们竭尽全力支持阿拉伯人民的民族独立斗争。美英侵略军如果不滚出黎巴嫩和约旦，阿拉伯人民和全世界人民必将把你们送进坟墓里去！”
    现在，下班后的机关干部和工人正拥集在东西长安大街和天安门广场，他们正开始走向代办处门前进行示威。
    新华社18日23时讯　愤怒的人群像海潮一样继续向英国代办处门前涌来，首都人民反对美英侵略中东的示威游行今天夜间仍在进行。到北京时间二十三时止，从四面八方上街示威的工人、机关干部、学生、市民已达二十多万人。
    游行的队伍高举火炬，人们忘掉一天的疲劳，纷纷从郊外赶到城内，振臂高呼“英美帝国主义滚出中东！”在英国代办处所在地的长达数里的一条马路两旁的建筑物上，无数漫画和抗议标语张贴了一层又一层。几个站在英国代办处门前接受抗议书的英国代办处工作人员，窘态毕露。
    北京第一机床厂一千四百多个工人刚刚下班，没有脱下工作服就从东郊赶到英国代办处门前示威。北京公私合营汽车附件厂的工人、市劳动模范田俊岭走到接受抗议书的两个英国人面前，举起拳头说：你们赶快转告英国政府，让你们的军队从约旦滚出去，中国工人有着巨大的力量，约旦、黎巴嫩、伊拉克的人民也和我们有同样的力量，你们如果不从约旦滚出去，就要叫你们粉身碎骨。田俊岭最后问一个英国代办处的工作人员说“你懂吗？”这个英国人低着头连连说，“懂”，“懂”。
    中央和北京市许多部门的干部下班后也纷纷拥上街头，加入游行队伍。北京市城市规划管理局设计院六百多个设计工作人员，昨日听到英国军队在约旦登陆的消息后，十分气愤，连夜写了一千多张抗议英帝国主义侵略的大字报。今天，他们全体都来到英国代办处门前示威。在解放战争中失掉一条腿的河北省人民检察院天津分院的副检察长张琳，拄着两根拐杖随着人群来到英国代办处的门口。他是由天津来北京开会的。他用拐杖敲着地，向着英国人高呼“美英滚出黎巴嫩、约旦去！滚出去！”
    许多家庭妇女也愤怒地来到英国代办处门前，表达她们保卫和平的决心。在西城区二龙路六百多人的游行队伍中，四十三岁的街道妇联会副主任王雨田，曾经在抗美援朝战争中组织妇女为前线志愿军战士做了一万多套军衣，今天她表示要同支援朝鲜兄弟姐妹一样，全力支援阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。
    夜已深了，举着火炬的人群还向英国代办处拥来。人们警告帝国主义者，如果再不缩回侵略的魔爪，将被焚毁于熊熊的火海中。
    新华社18日二十四时讯　现在已是午夜，北京示威游行的群众还在继续向英国驻中国代办处前进。许多工厂、学校、机关、团体，都连夜集会，谴责和抗议美国、英国干涉阿拉伯各国人民的内政。会后，人们带着集体讨论通过的抗议书，到街道上去游行示威。
