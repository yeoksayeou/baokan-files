Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 21st: In the Mishan Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province, tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers held various rallies, parades, and forums on July 20th in the six hundred-plus socialist new villages they personally pioneered, denouncing the US-British imperialists for playing with fire again in the Middle East.

　　These 100,000 demobilized soldiers, who have made significant contributions to world peace, are working hard to harvest the wheat they planted this year on this virgin land in a faster, better, and more economical way. They are making every effort to strengthen the power of peace-loving people around the world and support the struggle of the Middle Eastern people against US-British imperialist aggression. They have decided to shorten the original ten-day wheat harvesting task to within three days, and the month-long threshing task to within ten days. The length of the railway construction around the reclamation area will be doubled this year.

　　Among these 100,000 demobilized soldiers, many were originally Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers who fought alongside the Korean army and defeated the US-British imperialist invasion forces in Korea. Today, they issued a serious warning to their former defeated opponents - the US-British invading forces. They used their practical experience of defeating the US-British aggressors in Korea to demonstrate that peace-loving people have the power to defeat the aggressive US-British imperialists.

    密山垦区燃起反侵略的火焰
    十万转业军人举行示威游行
    新华社哈尔滨21日电  黑龙江省密山垦区，成千上万的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军转业军人，20日在他们自己亲手开辟的处女地上的六百多个社会主义新村里举行各种集会、游行和座谈会，声讨美英帝国主义又在中东玩火。
    这里的十万个对世界和平有重大贡献的转业军人，正努力多快好省地收割他们今年在这块处女地种下的麦子，尽一切努力加强世界爱好和平人民的力量，支援中东人民反对美英帝国主义侵略的斗争。他们决定把原来需要十天完成的收割小麦任务缩短在三天之内完成；把需要一个月完成的脱谷任务，缩短在十天之内完成。绕行垦区的铁路的修建长度，今年将增加两倍。
    在这十万转业军人中间，很多人原来是和朝鲜军队并肩打败了美英帝国主义侵朝部队的中国人民志愿军战士，他们今天向自己手下的败将——美英侵略军队发出了严重的警告。他们用自己在朝鲜打败美英侵略军的实际经验说明，爱好和平的人民完全有力量打败侵略成性的美英帝国主义者。
