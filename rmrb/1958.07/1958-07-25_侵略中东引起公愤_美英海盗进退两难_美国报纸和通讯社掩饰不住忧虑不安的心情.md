Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The armed intervention in the Middle East by US and British aggressors has not only aroused strong opposition from the Arab people and stern condemnation from the peace-loving people of the world, but has also been criticized by public opinion within the Western camp. Under these circumstances, some American newspapers and news agencies cannot conceal their unease about the isolated situation of the United States and are worried about the consequences of the aggression. They admit that the United States is now in a difficult position with no easy way out.

Lippmann Says
Western Military Force Cannot Conquer the Arab People's Revolutionary Movement

An article by columnist Lippmann published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 22nd acknowledged that the revolution in Iraq "is very popular at home" and immediately received the support of the army.

The article, entitled "Time for Diplomacy," concluded that any attempt to plot a "counter-revolution to restore the old Iraqi regime" would be futile. He said, "It is clear that any kind of military intervention, such as a military intervention by King Hussein of Jordan with the support of the United States and Britain, would have no chance of success." Lippmann believes that in this case, even if "a puppet government relying on British and American troops is established, this government is doomed to collapse once these troops withdraw. In other words, the Arab people's revolutionary movement cannot be conquered by Western military force."

Lippmann continued: "This basic truth also applies to our current situation in Lebanon." He emphasized that "any Lebanese government that survives on the strength of the (US) Marines is doomed to collapse after the Marines withdraw. Moreover, the longer the Marines stay, the more intense the Lebanese people's opposition to them will be."

Lippmann believes that the situation created in the Near and Middle East "cannot be changed by military means without risking incalculable serious dangers." He wrote that in this case, "politicians and diplomats should show their skills."

Lippmann believes that the United States' policy toward Lebanon demonstrated in the United Nations "is too superficial and lacks diplomatic vitality." Therefore, he suggested that "a broad proposal on the political future of Lebanon should be put forward soon." At the same time, he believes that it is unimaginable to solve the Lebanese problem without the participation of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic.

Associated Press Reporter Says
US-British Aggression is Extremely Unpopular

An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 23rd acknowledged that the lawless aggression committed by the US and British imperialists in Lebanon and Jordan is extremely unpopular, and that the two pirate groups have fallen into a dilemma with no easy way out.

The message admitted that Eisenhower's piratical behavior "has not received widespread support around the world," and "even in Lebanon, Chamoun's request or Eisenhower's actions have not received universal approval."

The message said, "If the issue of US troops staying in Lebanon is brought before the United Nations General Assembly, many African, Asian, and Arab countries may actually condemn the American intervention."

The message admitted that even if the United States can support the pro-Western Chamoun, "the Arab nationalist wave in the Middle East has now reached its peak." As soon as the US troops withdraw, "the whole operation will ultimately be completely in vain." The message raised an "unpleasant" and headache-inducing question for the US and British imperialists: When and how will the US troops in Lebanon withdraw? "What will happen to Hussein after the British withdraw next week, next month, or next year?"

Associated Press news analyst Roberts admitted in a commentary on the US-British intervention in the Middle East on the 21st: "As a final solution, there is not much hope in doing so."

Roberts said, "There is widespread unease in the United States and other allied countries around the world about whether the actions of the United States and Britain in the Middle East are moral." He also admitted, "If the actions of the United States and Britain are entirely aimed at Arab nationalism and the Arabs' clearly expressed desire to get rid of foreign rule, it will be difficult for them to justify their actions. On this issue, the more they try to cover it up, the greater the pressure inside the pot."

"Wall Street Journal" Says
A Wave of Criticism Against the United States Has Also Been Unleashed in West Germany and Japan

The "Wall Street Journal" published an article on the 22nd saying that the aggression by the United States and Britain has not only aroused resentment in Lebanon and Jordan, which have been directly subjected to aggression, but has also aroused resentment in many countries around the world.

The newspaper wrote: After the landing of US troops in Lebanon, "the people's indignation has caused us to lose our allies in this country. ... A wave of criticism has also been unleashed in West Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Even our closest ally, Canada, is uneasy about this."

The newspaper believes: "Even people in the White House and the State Department did not expect that our steps would cause this kind of reaction."

A dispatch from the "Wall Street Journal" correspondent in Amman pointed out that Jordanian residents expressed indignation at the landing of British troops. The vast majority of Jordanian residents oppose the British. The correspondent said that US and British officials fear that the Jordanian residents' obvious cold attitude towards the British occupying forces may develop into open hostility. The correspondent emphasized that what makes US and British officials increasingly uneasy is that the escalating tension in Jordan due to the landing of British troops may further weaken King Hussein's already unstable position. The correspondent wrote: "The hostile attitude of most residents towards the landing of British troops has strengthened the position of the opposition." The correspondent said that many influential Jordanian citizens said: "There is only one way to make the British paratroopers withdraw from Jordan, and that is to get rid of those who brought in the British paratroopers. Then we can forcefully force them to get out."

"Baltimore Sun" Commentator
Says the United States is in an Unprecedentedly Isolated Position in the United Nations

"Baltimore Sun" foreign affairs commentator Ward reported from Washington that American diplomats have encountered unprecedented difficulties in winning the support of a series of United Nations member states for the American intervention in Lebanon.

He wrote, "Twenty-seven United Nations member states have already publicly declared their disapproval of the American intervention. In addition, the United States' position has become even more difficult because Khrushchev has proposed convening a summit meeting to discuss the Middle East crisis."

According to Ward, the reaction of Latin American countries to the American aggression in the Middle East has frustrated Washington. He wrote, "There is reason to believe that President Eisenhower is particularly shocked and worried about the reaction of Latin America ... not only Latin America (Latin America's twenty votes are a basic factor in Washington's many victories in the United Nations General Assembly), but also Western Europe and certain regions of the Far East. The initial reaction to Washington's actions in Lebanon was not at all the 'widely welcomed' reaction that Republican National Committee Chairman Alcorn said on Saturday. The authorities have already admitted this."

Ward also said that the US military personnel's talk of the "atomic potential" of the American armed forces in the Middle East, as well as the American violation of Austrian airspace, did not help American diplomats to obtain support for the American position.

    侵略中东引起公愤　美英海盗进退两难
    美国报纸和通讯社掩饰不住忧虑不安的心情
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美英侵略者对中东的武装干涉，不仅引起阿拉伯人民的强烈反对和世界和平人民的严正谴责，而且在西方阵营内也受到了舆论的抨击。在这种情况下，美国的一些报纸和通讯社也掩饰不了他们对美国孤立处境的不安，并且对侵略行动的后果表示担心。它们承认，目前美国已经陷于进退两难的狼狈地步。
    李普曼说
    西方武力征服不了阿拉伯人民革命运动
    “纽约先驱论坛报”22日刊载的这家报纸评论员李普曼的一篇文章承认，伊拉克的革命“在国内很得人心”，它立即得到陆军的支持。
    这篇题为“是进行外交活动的时候了”的文章得出这样的结论：任何想策划“反革命来复辟伊拉克旧制度”的企图都是枉费心机的。他说，“很明显，任何种类的军事干涉，例如约旦国王侯赛因在英美支持下进行军事干涉，都不会有任何成功的机会”。李普曼认为，在这种情况下，即使建立起来“一个依靠英美军队的傀儡政府，这个政府在这些军队一旦撤走后就注定要垮台。换一个说法就是，阿拉伯人的人民革命运动不是西方武力所能征服的”。
    李普曼继续说：“这一个基本真理也适用于我们目前在黎巴嫩的处境”。他着重指出，“任何靠（美国）海军陆战队而生存的黎巴嫩政府，在这支海军陆战队撤走之后注定要垮台。而且，海军陆战队呆的时间越久，黎巴嫩人民反对他们的情绪也会越激烈。”
    李普曼认为，中近东所造成的局势“不可能用军事手段来改变而又不冒难以估计的严重危险”。他写道，在这种情况下，“应该由政治家和外交家来显身手了”。
    李普曼认为，美国在联合国表现出来的对黎巴嫩政策“太肤浅，它缺乏外交活力”。因此，他建议“应该很快地提出一个关于黎巴嫩政治前途的广泛建议”。同时他认为，没有苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的参加，要解决黎巴嫩问题是不可想像的。
    美联社记者说
    美英侵略行动极其不得人心
    美联社23日从华盛顿发出的一则消息承认美英帝国主义者在黎巴嫩和约旦进行的无法无天的侵略行动极其不得人心，因此这两个海盗集团已经陷入了进退两难的窘境。
    消息承认，艾森豪威尔的海盗行径“在全世界远没有得到广泛的支持”，“即使是在黎巴嫩，夏蒙的请求或是艾森豪威尔的行动也远没有得到普遍的赞同”。
    消息说，“如果美国军队驻在黎巴嫩的问题提到联合国大会上的话，许多非洲、亚洲和阿拉伯国家可能实际上将谴责美国的干涉。”
    消息承认，美国即使能够把亲西方的夏蒙扶持住，但是，“中东的阿拉伯民族主义浪潮现在达到了顶点”，只要美国军队一撤走，“这次的整个行动将终于是完全徒然的”。消息提出了一个使美英帝国主义者“很不愉快”和头痛的问题：在黎巴嫩的美国军队将在什么时候并且将怎样退出呢？“当英国人在下星期、下个月或者明年撤退以后，侯赛因将怎样呢？”
    美联社新闻分析员罗伯茨21日在评论美英对中东的干涉行动时承认：“作为一个最后解决的步骤，这样作并没有什么大希望”。
    罗伯茨说，“美国和世界各地其他盟国对英美在中东的行动是否合乎道义普遍感到不安。”他还承认，“如果英美的行动完全只是针对阿拉伯民族主义以及阿拉伯人明显表现出来的摆脱外国统治的愿望，它们就很难为它们的行动辩护。在这个问题上，它们越是想把盖子盖上，罐内的压力就越大。”
    “华尔街日报”说
    在西德和日本也掀起了抨击美国的浪潮
    “华尔街日报”22日发表文章说，美国和英国的侵略不仅引起直接遭受侵略的黎巴嫩和约旦的愤慨，而且引起世界许多国家的愤慨。
    报纸写道：美军在黎巴嫩登陆后“人民的愤慨使我们丧失了在这个国家的盟友。……在西德、日本和瑞典也掀起了抨击的浪潮。甚至我们最亲近的盟邦加拿大也为此感到不安。”
    报纸认为：“白宫人士和国务院人士中甚至没有料想到，我们的步骤会引起这种反应。”
    “华尔街日报”驻安曼记者发来的消息指出，约旦居民对英国军队的着陆表示愤慨。约旦绝大多数居民反对英国人。记者说，美国和英国的官方人士害怕，约旦居民对英国占领军的明显的冷淡态度可能发展成为公开的敌对。记者强调指出，美英官方人士日感不安的是在约旦因英国军队的着陆而不断加剧的紧张局势可能进一步削弱侯赛因国王早已不稳定的地位。记者写道：“大多数居民对英国军队的登陆所采取的敌对态度加强了反对派的地位。”记者说，许多有影响的约旦公民表示：“要使英国伞兵自约旦撤退，只有一个办法，这就是干掉那些招来英国伞兵的人，那时我们就可以威武地迫使他们滚出去。”
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”评论员
    说美国在联合国处境空前孤立
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”外交评论员瓦尔德自华盛顿报道，美国外交家在争取一系列联合国会员国支持美国对黎巴嫩的干涉方面遇到了空前的困难。
    他写道，“二十七个联合国会员国已经公开声明不赞同美国的干涉。此外，由于赫鲁晓夫提出召开高级会议讨论中东危机的建议，美国的处境就更加困难。”
    据瓦尔德说，拉丁美洲国家对美国侵略中东的反应使华盛顿感到沮丧。他写道，“人们有理由认为，艾森豪威尔总统对拉丁美洲的反应感到特别震惊和忧愁……不仅拉丁美洲（拉丁美洲的二十票是华盛顿在联合国大会表决时取得许多胜利的基本因素），而且西欧以及远东的某些地区，对于华盛顿在黎巴嫩的行动的最初反应也完全不像共和党全国委员会主席奥尔科恩星期六所说的‘广泛欢迎’，这一点当局已经承认。”
    瓦尔德还说，美国在中东的指挥人员对于美国武装部队的“原子潜力”的说法，以及美国侵犯奥地利领空的行为，都无助于美国外交家得到对美国立场的支持。
