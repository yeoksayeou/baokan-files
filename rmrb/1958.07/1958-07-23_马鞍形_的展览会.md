People's Daily, Taiyuan Dispatch: The Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while convening an enlarged meeting of the Prefectural Committee to convey the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, held a "saddle-shaped" exhibition hall, using the "saddle-shaped" historical facts of the development of work in the Changzhi area over the past three years to educate cadres, promote and improve work, and received very good results.

This exhibition is divided into six parts: industry, agriculture, culture and health, transportation, finance and trade, and politics and law. The exhibition hall uses more than 670 charts, graphs, and cartoons, and more than 1,700 physical objects, to indicate the specific saddle shape of the leap forward, slow advance, and great leap forward in all aspects of the region's work since the second half of 1955. More than 2,100 cadres from the special districts, counties, townships, and communes, and cadres from directly affiliated organs participated in the tour.

The exhibition hall tells people that when we follow the central government's general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and move forward bravely, all aspects of the region's work are full of vitality and have achieved great results. In 1956, the region added 570,000 mu of irrigated land, more than doubling the historical total of 260,000 mu. In that year, 4.36 million mu of soil and water conservation area were completed, 448,000 mu of afforestation, 47.28 million trees were planted, 110,000 people were eliminated from illiteracy, and 3.14 million rats and sparrows were eliminated. Compared with the past, all aspects of work were a leap forward. Although the region suffered the worst flood in sixty years and some areas suffered from wind, hail, and insect disasters, the unit area yield of autumn grain reached 225.7 jin per mu, an increase of more than 2% over the 220.12 jin per mu in the bumper harvest of 1955. However, starting in the second half of 1956, small patches of "anti-adventurism" clouds appeared in the countryside, disrupting the rural atmosphere and dampening the enthusiasm of the masses, the speed of construction changed from fast to slow, and the work achievements were relatively small. The development magnitude of this year, taking 1956 as 100, was 39% for water conservancy, 56% for soil and water conservation, 89% for afforestation, 21% for literacy elimination, and 21.6% for eliminating rats and sparrows. Although grain production suffered from autumn drought in some counties (the reduction in production due to disasters was roughly the same as the previous year), the so-called "adventurism" was reversed, resulting in sparse planting instead of dense planting, low yield instead of high yield, and the replanting area was reduced by 30% compared with the previous year, so the unit area yield of autumn grain only reached 92% of the previous year. In the second half of 1957, inspired by the central government's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, all aspects of the region's work achieved an unprecedented great leap forward. The production upsurge developed on the basis of the decisive victory in the all-people rectification campaign against the rightists was far larger in scale and greater in achievements than the production upsurge in 1956. Up to now, the newly added irrigated land is 410% of 1956 (the same below), soil and water conservation is 114%, tree planting is 680%, literacy elimination is 160%, eliminating rats and sparrows is 370%, and the base fertilizer for autumn crops has doubled. Wheat has a bumper harvest, and preliminary estimates are that the average yield per mu can reach 172 jin, an increase of 76% over last year, and autumn seedlings are generally growing well.

These thought-provoking facts have greatly enlightened the cadres from the special districts, counties, townships, and communes who participated in this meeting, and the cadres have received a profound education. Many cadres who originally lacked confidence in the construction of mountainous areas said after the visit: It is not that the mountainous areas have no future, but that their own thinking has not been liberated. The saddle shape teaches us that we must always follow the Party's line in our work.

    “马鞍形”的展览会
    本报太原电  中共长治地委在最近召开地委扩大会议传达党的八届二次会议精神的同时，开办一个“马鞍形”展览会馆，用最近三年长治地区工作发展的“马鞍形”历史史实教育干部，推动和改进工作，收到很好的效果。
    这次展览共分工业、农业、文化卫生、交通运输、财经贸易、政法等六个部分，展览馆用六百七十多幅图表漫画与一千七百多件实物，标示出全区1955年下半年以来各方面工作由跃进、缓进、大跃进的具体的马鞍形。参加会议的专县乡社干部与直属机关干部二千一百多人进行了参观。
    展览馆告诉人们，当我们遵循中央多快好省的建设方针勇敢前进的时候，全区各方面工作生气勃勃取得了很大成绩。1956年，全区新增水地五十七万亩，超过历史水地总和二十六万亩的一倍以上。这一年完成的水土保持面积四百三十六万亩，造林四十四万八千亩，植树四千七百二十八万株，扫除文盲十一万人，消灭鼠雀三百一十四万只，和过去比较，各方面工作都是一个跃进。这一年虽然全区遭到六十年来所没有过的涝灾与部分地区遭到风、雹、虫灾，秋粮单位面积产量每亩获得二百二十五点七斤的收成，比丰收的1955年亩产二百二十点一二斤还提高了百分之二还多。但自1956年下半年开始，农村出现了小片“反冒进”乌云，扰乱了农村气氛，挫伤了群众干劲，建设的速度由快变慢，工作成绩也就比较小了。这一年的发展幅度，如以1956年为一百，则水利为39％，土水保持为56％，造林为89％，扫盲为21％，消灭鼠雀为21.6％。粮食生产虽因部分县遭受秋旱（算因灾减产部分大体相同于上年），但因反掉了所谓“冒进”结果不少地方密植变稀植，高产变低产，复播面积比上年缩小了30％，因而秋粮单位面积产量只完成上年的92％。1957年下半年在中央足鼓干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线鼓舞之下，全区各方面工作又获得了空前大跃进。在全民整风反右派斗争取得决定性胜利基础上所发展起来的生产高潮，其规模之壮成绩之大远远超过了1956年的生产高潮，到目前为止，新增水地为1956年的410％（下同），水土保持为114％，植树为680％，扫盲为160％，消灭鼠雀为370％，秋作物底肥增加了一倍。小麦丰收，初步估产平均每亩可达一百七十二斤，比去年提高76％，秋苗生长普遍良好。
    这些引人深思的事实对于参加这次会议的专县乡社干部启发很大，使干部们受到了一次深刻的教育。许多原来对山区建设缺乏信心的干部，参观后说：不是山区没前途，是自己思想没有解放。马鞍形教育我们，必须时刻遵循党的路线进行工作。
