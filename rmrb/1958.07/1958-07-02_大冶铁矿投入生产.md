Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st—The renowned Daye Iron Mine officially went into production today, half a year ahead of schedule.

This main iron ore base for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex plans to mine 900,000 tons of iron ore this year to meet the needs of the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel, which is scheduled to be completed and put into production before National Day this year.

The Daye Iron Mine began construction in August 1955. For nearly three years, the mine builders have used heroic labor to heal the scars left by the long-term and frantic plunder of the mining area by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionary rulers, and have basically built it into a large-scale modern mine from its dilapidated foundation. Using powerful mining machinery, the builders removed more than 5 million cubic meters of waste rock from Jianshan and Shizi Mountain, lowering the height of these two mountains by dozens of meters. The mining area, which was overgrown with weeds three years ago, has now been developed into neat, terraced mining sites. Two electric locomotive railways, each about fifty kilometers long, have been built, winding up the mountainside along the mining area, reaching the top of the mountains, and connecting at the other end to the Wuchang-Daye railway line, leading directly to the Wuhan Iron and Steel plant area. The ore dressing plant at the foot of the mine is currently under intense construction. The three main workshops of the ore crushing system will be officially put into production in August. The machine repair facilities area needed for mine production has been basically completed.

    大冶铁矿投入生产
    据新华社武汉1日电　著名的大冶铁矿已提前半年在今天正式投入生产。
    这个武汉钢铁联合企业的铁矿石主要基地，为了适应武钢一号高炉提前在今年国庆节建成并投入生产的需要，计划在今年采掘铁矿石九十万吨。
    大冶铁矿是从1955年8月开始建设的。将近三年来，矿山建设者们用英勇的劳动，医治好了这个矿区由于日本侵略者和国民党反动统治者长期疯狂掠夺所遗留的疮痍，并且把它从残破的基础上基本上建成为一座大型的现代化的矿山。建设者们用威力强大的矿山机械，从尖山、狮子山上剥去了五百多万立方公尺的废石，使这两座山头都下降了数十公尺；三年前还是荒草遍野的矿区，如今已经被开拓成一层一层整齐的、台阶形的采矿场地。两条长约五十公里的电气机车铁路已经筑成，沿矿区的山腰蜿蜒而上，直达山顶，另一端连接着武昌——大冶铁路线，直通武钢厂区。矿山脚下的选矿厂目前正在紧张施工。破碎矿石系统的三个主体车间，8月份将正式投入生产。为矿山生产所需的机修设施区，已经基本上建成了。
