Careful Egg Duck Raising

How to raise egg-laying ducks well? Here, I will simply discuss the issues that need attention in feeding management for your reference. First, the location of the duck shed should be appropriately selected, preferably near rivers and ponds, to facilitate water release. The duck shed is best to face south and be well-lit, with good air circulation, and a suitable temperature. This is one of the important conditions to ensure more egg production. Second, the feed should be appropriately matched, and diversified, truly having dry and green, refined and coarse, meat and vegetarian. Ducks in the laying period have a greater need for meat food, so feed more meat food to increase egg production. In addition, feed such as aquatic plants, vegetable peels, and salt are also very much needed by laying ducks. Third, regularly clean the duck shed. Damp duck sheds are the enemy of laying ducks. Not only will it reduce egg production, but it will also easily cause the ducks to become thin, causing feather rot, and even illness and death. Therefore, keep the duck shed dry and clean regularly. Fourth, ducks are timid and very sensitive to external reactions, such as thunder, lightning, storms, changes in the environment, and changes in management personnel, which can affect the egg production of ducks. Therefore, pay attention to these issues when releasing ducks, especially keep the duck shed quiet, without noise or commotion. When entering the shed at night to add feed, water, and check, be very careful and gentle to avoid startling the ducks. In addition, the daily life of the ducks should be well arranged, such as releasing them to water, feeding them, etc., all should be subject to a certain system and strictly observed.

    饲养蛋鸭要细心
    如何饲养好出蛋鸭，这里只简单谈一下饲养管理中须注意的问题，以供参考。一、鸭棚地点选择要适当，最好靠河流和水塘，便于放水。鸭棚最好坐北朝南，并要阳光充足，空气流通，温度适宜。这是保证产卵多的重要条件之一。二、饲料要搭配得适当，做到多样化，真是有干有青，有精有粗，有荤有素。鸭在产卵期对荤食需要量较大，要多喂荤食，才能提高产蛋量。另外，水草、菜皮和食盐等饲料，产蛋鸭也非常需要。三、要经常做好鸭棚的清洁卫生。鸭棚潮湿是产蛋鸭的敌人。不但使产蛋下降，而且容易造成鸭体消瘦，引起烂毛，以致生病死亡。所以，对鸭棚要经常保持干燥清洁。四、鸭子胆小，对外界的反映很敏感，如打雷、闪电、狂风暴雨，改变环境及换生人管理等，都能影响鸭的产卵量。所以，在放鸭时都要注意这些问题，特别是鸭棚内要保持安静、不许喧哗和吵闹。晚上进入棚内加添食料、饮水和检查时，要十分细致，动作要轻，以免鸭子受惊。此外，对于鸭子的日常生活要安排得好，如放水，吃食等都要规定一定的制度，严格遵守。  丁三
