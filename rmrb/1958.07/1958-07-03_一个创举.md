    A Creative Initiative
    The workers of the weaving workshop at the Zhengzhou State-owned No. 3 Cotton Mill have boldly changed the “May First” weaving method and created the “Leap Forward” weaving method, which has greatly advanced weaving work. This is a major innovation in the textile industry.
    The greatest advantage of the "Leap Forward" weaving method is that it can make the weaving workers' work more proactive and regular, and can more reasonably organize the labor force and give play to the efficiency of the machines. It can not only increase the number of looms that workers can manage to increase production and prevent the generation of substandard cloth to improve quality, but also reduce the workers' labor intensity and simplify operating techniques, creating favorable conditions for cultivating technical forces in the future. Therefore, the "Leap Forward" weaving method is an advanced working method for saving manpower and increasing production.
    The emergence of the "Leap Forward" weaving method shows that all old methods and old systems that are incompatible with the development of social productive forces should be reformed; all new systems, new ideas, and new methods that are suitable for and can promote the development of social productive forces should be developed. Because production is in a state of constant development and change, new production technologies are constantly replacing old production technologies, and the innovation of production technology can promote the continuous improvement of production. New reforms in spinning, sizing, and weaving in the Shanghai textile industry also fully illustrate this point.

    一个创举
    郑州国棉三厂织布车间的职工们，大胆地改变了“五一”织布工作法，创造了“跃进”织布工作法，把织布工作大大地向前推进了一步，这是纺织工业上的一大创举。
    “跃进”织布工作法最大的好处是：能够使织布工人的工作更加主动、有规律，能够更合理地组织劳动力，发挥机器的效能，它不但能增加工人的看台能力以提高产量、预防次布产生以改进质量，而且可以减少工人的劳动强度，简化操作技术，为今后培养技术力量创造了有利条件。因此“跃进”织布工作法是节省人力、提高产量的先进工作法。
    “跃进”织布工作法的产生，说明了一切对社会生产力发展不相适应的老办法、旧制度都应该被改革；一切适合和能够促进社会生产力发展的新制度、新思想、新方法应该得到发展。因为生产是处在不断发展变动的状态中，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术，生产技术的革新，就能推动生产的不断的提高。上海纺织业在纺纱、浆纱、织布等方面新的改革，也充分说明这一点。
