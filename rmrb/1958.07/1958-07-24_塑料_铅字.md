    Plastic "Type"
    (Our dispatch) Fuzhou First Printing Factory workers successfully trialed plastic type to replace lead type at the end of June. Printing tests have proven that the typeface is clearer than that of lead type.

    Type cast from plastic has many advantages: First, lead type can only print a maximum of 40,000 rotations, while plastic type (i.e., made of polyvinyl chloride, etc.) can print 150,000 rotations. Second, the cost of plastic type is half that of lead type, and its weight is only about one-tenth of lead. Third, it can fundamentally solve the problem of occupational lead poisoning for typesetting and type-casting workers. (Li Shiquan)

    塑料“铅字”
    本报讯　福州第一印刷厂职工在6月底试用塑料代铅铸字成功。经过印刷证明，字面比铅铸的还清楚。
    用塑料铸成的字有很多好处：第一，铅字最多只能印四万轮转，塑料（即聚氯乙稀等）铸的字，可印十五万轮转。第二，塑料字的成本比铅字低一半，重量也只有铅的十分之一左右。第三，可以从根本上解决排字、铸字工人铅中毒的职业病问题。　（李世泉）
