Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front Dispatch Under the unified leadership of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the various units of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front have decided to organize a strong labor force to carry out comprehensive collaboration with local Party and government leading organs and production units in production and construction and coastal defense struggles.

Recently, the Party committees of various units, in accordance with the decision of the Fujian Provincial Committee to produce one million tons of steel and achieve a "thousand-jin province," held collaboration meetings with the local prefectural and county Party committees respectively, and jointly studied and formulated leap forward plans. At the meetings, the responsible persons of the Party committees of various units, as if receiving combat missions, requested that the most arduous engineering tasks be assigned to them. The Party committee of a certain unit proposed to the prefectural committee that 100,000 workdays be allocated to construction within two months, with some of them camping and working at three iron mine sites in a certain county; the troops undergoing training would help each township in their garrison area establish a fertilizer plant and an agricultural implement repair shop. Another unit, in addition to contributing 100,000 workdays to participate in the industrial and agricultural construction of five counties, planned to convert its machinery repair shop into a processing plant to repair blowers, rice milling machines, and harvesters for the local area. A certain unit stationed in the Jinjiang area south prepared to participate in labor for three months in the second half of this year, and planned to allocate 50 to 100 trucks and 5 to 10 tractors to participate in project transportation. The artillery unit transferred ten machine tools and a group of technicians to assist the prefectural committee in establishing a repair shop. A naval unit organized a technical team to assist mines, factories, and power stations in the stationed area in repairing diesel engines and gasoline engines. The garrison troops on Dongshan Island assisted the government in building a biogas plant. A certain railway engineering unit also prepared to train the existing 12,000 migrant workers to the level of technicians above the third grade using the method of apprenticeships. Communication troops and various hospitals also vigorously trained technicians, drivers, tractor drivers, electricians, telegraph operators, health workers, and midwives for the local area. All units will also conduct a thorough inventory of warehouses and give any materials, machinery, vehicles, lathes, and army horses that can be spared to local use.

From January to May of this year, the troops on the Fujian Front have contributed 1.11 million workdays in support of industrial and agricultural construction, built 502 water conservancy projects, repaired 730 kilometers of highways, and handed over 250 trucks, 85 engines, 137 ships, and all equipment and personnel of a shipyard to the local authorities. A hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 150 kilowatts built by a certain unit will also be completed ahead of schedule.

At the collaboration meeting, both sides also made unified plans to strengthen coastal defense struggles and safeguard socialist construction. In order to facilitate the organization of comprehensive collaboration, the various units established specialized offices, and leading cadres at all levels participated in the work of local Party committees and branches, and some also concurrently served as deputy factory (mine) directors of industrial and mining enterprises, and deputy chairmen of agricultural cooperatives.

    新华社福建前线电在中共福建省委统一领导下，中国人民解放军福建前线各部队决定组织强大的劳动队伍，同当地的党政领导机关和生产单位在生产建设与海防斗争中，实行全面大协作。
    最近，各部队党委根据福建省委作出的产钢百万吨和实现千斤省的决定，分别与各地地委、县委举行协作会议，统一研究和制订了跃进计划。会上，各部队党委负责人像接受战斗任务一样，要求分配给最艰巨的工程任务。某部党委向地委提出，两个月内抽出十万个劳动日参加建设，其中一部分到某县三个铁矿工地扎营劳动；正在进行训练的部队帮助驻地每个乡建立一个化肥厂，一个农具修配厂。另一支部队除出十万个劳动日参加五个县的工农业建设以外，准备把修械所改成加工厂，给地方修理鼓风机、碾米机、收割机。驻晋江以南地区某部，今年下半年以三个月时间参加劳动，并准备抽出汽车五十到一百辆，拖拉机五台到十台参加工程运输。炮兵部队抽调十台机床和一批技术人员协助地委建立一个修配厂。海军某部组织一支技术队，到驻区内的矿山、工厂、发电站协助修理柴油机、汽油机。东山岛守备部队协助政府建设一座沼气厂。铁道兵某部还准备用带徒弟的办法把现有的一万二千名民工，培养到三级以上技工水平。通讯兵部队和各医院也大力为地方训练技术人员、驾驶员、拖拉机手、电工、报务员、保健员和助产士。各单位还将清理一次仓库，把能抽出的器材、机器、车辆、车床和军马送给地方使用。
    今年1月到5月，福建前线部队在支援工农业建设中，已出动了一百十一万个劳动日，修建水利工程五百零二处，修公路七百三十公里，并把二百五十辆汽车，八十五部发动机、一百三十七只船和一个修船厂的全部设备、人员交给了地方。某部兴建的发电量一百五十瓩的水力发电站，也将提前完工。
    协作会议上，双方对加强海防斗争，保卫社会主义建设也作了统一规划。为了便于组织全面协作，各部队成立了专门的办公室，各级领导干部参加了当地党委和支部工作，有的还兼任了工矿的副厂（矿）长，农业社的副社长。
