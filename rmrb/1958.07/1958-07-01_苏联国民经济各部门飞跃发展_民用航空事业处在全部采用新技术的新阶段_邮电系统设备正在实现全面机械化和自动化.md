Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - The Soviet civil aviation industry is currently in a new stage of fully adopting new technologies, and the latest aircraft and aviation equipment will be increasingly widely used in civil aviation. By 1965, the national civil aviation freight and mail volume will increase fourfold compared to this year, and passenger volume will increase even more.

The Soviet civil aviation industry is far ahead of the United States and other capitalist countries in the use of jet airliners. In 1956, the Soviet Union successfully manufactured the "Tu-104" jet jumbo airliner, using jet aircraft in civil aviation for the first time in the world. Since then, the types of Soviet jet airliners have increased day by day. Now, in addition to the "Tu-104," there are many types of jet airliners such as "Tu-104A," "Tu-110," "Tu-114," "Tu-114D," "Ukraine," and "Moscow." The number of jet airliners and the routes using jet airliners are also constantly increasing. The United States, up to now, has not produced a single jet airliner.

Currently, the general trend of technological innovation in the Soviet civil aviation industry is: jet aircraft and turbo-prop aircraft will be used on routes where jet airliners can fly for more than ten hours. The "Il-12," "Il-14," and other piston-propeller aircraft currently used on these routes will gradually be changed to only undertake flight missions on local routes with a range of 500 to 600 kilometers. Many routes that currently use single-propeller engine aircraft will gradually use more technologically advanced aircraft such as "Il-12" and "Il-14"; the operation of these twin-engine aircraft on local routes can greatly increase passenger capacity.

The Soviet Union has now produced many new-style helicopters, as well as small aircraft with two engines that can carry six or seven passengers. This small "Little Bee" air taxi can take off on a runway 60 meters long. With the wide application of this type of aircraft, it will be possible to open civil aviation stations in many villages and settlements.

Due to the substantial increase in freight and passenger volume, all routes and many aviation stations and airports will have to be rebuilt. Spacious and well-equipped waiting rooms and comfortable hotels will be built in many airports. In the next few years, the Soviet Union will also establish a large number of new aviation station networks, new take-off and landing equipment, and navigation equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - While various sectors of the Soviet national economy are developing by leaps and bounds, the Soviet postal and telecommunications system is also realizing the full mechanization and automation of postal equipment.

There are currently 58,000 postal and telecommunications enterprises in the Soviet Union, the largest of which is the postal system, which has more than 200,000 postmen. Last year alone, post offices handled 11.4 billion publications, 4 billion letters, 281 million remittances, and 82 million parcels. If the processing of such a large volume of mail is mechanized and automated, it will greatly improve mail delivery efficiency. The Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to first realize full mechanization in the fifty largest postal institutions in the country in the next six to seven years. These institutions will be equipped with machines for internal transmission and processing of mail. A mail sorting machine that can simultaneously sort letters into fifty to one hundred categories has now been successfully manufactured. The Moscow branch will also install approximately 10,000 automated and semi-automated machines for selling stamps and envelopes.

In terms of telecommunications in the Soviet Union, the telegraph transmission process of 40% of telegraph lines has now been automated, which not only improves work efficiency but also saves manpower. Soon, the main processes of telegraph transmission, reception, classification, and internal transmission will all be automated. The Soviet telephone communication tools will also be further expanded and improved. In the coming years, manually connected telephone lines will be gradually transitioned to automatic switching. New technical equipment will be installed on important telephone lines in various regions to facilitate timely communication, which will greatly facilitate production leadership and communication in various economic zones.

    苏联国民经济各部门飞跃发展
    民用航空事业处在全部采用新技术的新阶段
    邮电系统设备正在实现全面机械化和自动化
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联民用航空事业目前正处在全部采用新技术的新阶段，最新式的飞机和航空设备将在民用航空中得到日益广泛的应用。到1965年，全国民用航空的货运量和邮件运输量将增加为今年的四倍，客运量将增加更多。
    苏联民用航空事业在采用喷气客机方面远远地走在美国和其他资本主义国家前面。1956年，苏联制造成功“图——一○四”喷气式巨型客机，在世界上头一次在民用航空上使用喷气式飞机。从那时以来，苏联喷气式客机的种类日益增多，现在除了“图——一○四”以外，还有“图——104A”、“图——110”、“图——114”、“图——114D”、“乌克兰”式、“莫斯科”式等许多类型的喷气客机，喷气客机的数目和使用喷气客机的航线也在不断增加。而美国直到现在，还没有生产过一架喷气客机。
    目前，苏联民用航空事业进行技术革新的总趋势是：在凡是能用喷气客机飞行十小时以上的航线都将使用喷气飞机和喷气螺旋桨飞机。目前在这些航线上还在使用的“伊尔——十二”、“伊尔——十四”等活塞螺旋桨飞机将逐渐改为只担负航程在五百公里到六百公里之间的地方性航线上的飞行任务。许多现在使用单螺旋桨发动机飞机的航线上将逐渐使用“伊尔——十二”、“伊尔——十四”等技术比较先进的飞机；这些双发动机飞机在地方性航线上行驶，可以大大增加载客量。
    苏联现在已经生产了许多新式直升飞机，以及有两个发动机的、能载客六、七人的小飞机。这种小型的“小蜜蜂”式空中出租飞机可以在六十公尺长的跑道上起飞。广泛应用这种飞机以后，就能在许多乡村和居民点都开辟民用航空站。
    由于货运量和客运量大大增加，全部航线以及许多航空站和机场都要进行改建。在许多航空港内将建筑宽大的设备完善的候机室和舒适的旅馆。在最近几年内，苏联还将建立大量的新航空站网、新式的起飞降落设备和导航设备。
    新华社莫斯科30日电　在苏联国民经济各部门飞跃发展的同时，苏联邮电系统也正在实现邮电设备的全面机械化和自动化。
    全苏联现在有五万八千个邮电企业，其中工作规模最大的是邮政系统，它拥有二十多万邮递员。去年一年经过邮局收发的出版物有一百一十四亿份，信件四十亿封，汇款两亿八千一百万起，包裹八千二百万件。这样大量的邮件的处理过程如果加以机械化和自动化，就会大大提高邮件发送效率。苏联邮电部已经决定在最近六、七年内在全国五十个最大的邮政机构中首先实现全面机械化，这些机构将配备在内部传送和处理邮件的机器。一种同时能把信件分成五十到一百类的邮类机现在已经制造成功。莫斯科分局还将安装约一万架出售邮票、信封的自动化和半自动化的机器。
    在苏联的电讯联络方面，现在有40％的电报线路的发报过程已经自动化，这不但提高了工作效率，而且节省了人力。不久，电报的收发、分类和内部传送的主要过程都将实行自动化。苏联的电话联络工具也将进一步扩大和改进。在今后几年内，用人工接线的电话都要逐步过渡到自动接线。各地的重要电话线路都要配置新的技术设备，以便及时通话，这将给各经济区的生产领导和联系造成很大便利。
