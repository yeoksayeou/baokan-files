    How the American War of Independence Dealt with Counter-Revolutionaries and Obtained Foreign Aid

    Question: 1. Eisenhower's speech on the 15th slandered the Iraqi revolution as "extremely barbaric." We do not get this impression from the dispatches sent by Western journalists from Baghdad. However, we would like to know what methods the American War of Independence adopted against domestic and foreign enemies? Are the methods they adopted different from the methods used by the Iraqi people today against the reactionary dynasty?

    2. Eisenhower accuses the struggle of the Iraqi and Lebanese people as being the result of foreign military aid, which is equally unfounded. The "People's Daily" editorial has already refuted this. The editorial mentioned that the American War of Independence received foreign military aid and had volunteer soldiers participating in the war. We would like to have a more detailed explanation of this point.

    Answer: Your two questions are answered separately as follows:

      (1) American independence was obtained through fierce revolutionary struggles and war. During the period when the revolutionary movement was brewing, the American people took various "illegal" revolutionary "riots" to resist the British rulers. In 1765, when resisting the Stamp Act, American patriotic people destroyed customs patrol ships, closed courts, and destroyed tax collectors' residences, smeared tax collectors' faces with tar, glued feathers, and dragged them to the streets for parades. In 1772, the British sent the armed sailing ship "Gaspee" to patrol the coast of Rhode Island to suppress smuggling. American patriots, in a fit of anger, destroyed the ship. In 1773, patriotic youths in Boston disguised themselves as Indians, boarded the East India Company's tea ships, and dumped all the tea into the sea. When the War of Independence broke out, the people of the thirteen colonies drove away the governors and British officials, overthrew the British colonial government, established revolutionary regimes, and took emergency revolutionary measures to implement dictatorship over the "Loyalists," the counter-revolutionary elements within the United States who expressed their support for the British King at that time. Each state established a safety committee, deprived the "Loyalists" of their civil rights, confiscated the "Loyalists'" property, restricted their freedom of speech and publication, and forbade them from carrying out counter-revolutionary propaganda in support of the British King and opposing independence. The property confiscated by the safety committees from the "Loyalists" amounted to 40 million US dollars. The states imposed the death penalty on "Loyalists" who had committed treason, and formulated various laws to strictly control the activities of the "Loyalists." In New York and New Jersey, "Loyalist" lawyers were not allowed to practice; in Pennsylvania, "Loyalist" pharmacists were not allowed to operate. The northern states arrested large numbers of "Loyalists" and expelled them from the country. Under severe expulsion, a total of 80,000 "Loyalists" fled back to Britain or the West Indies. The southern states generally relied on suppression to maintain revolutionary order. For "Loyalists" with lighter offenses, the public security committees of each state also smeared them with tar, glued feathers, and ordered them to parade in public. During the war, only in southern New York State, where the "Loyalists" gathered, did the British army rely on the help of the "Loyalists" to temporarily maintain its bloody rule. Obviously, it was correct and necessary for the American people to overthrow the "legal" suzerain state regime with revolutionary actions, and to adopt revolutionary measures to suppress internal counter-revolutionary elements. Similarly, the revolutionary measures taken by the Iraqi people today against the Faisal dynasty are also completely correct and necessary. In fact, the methods adopted by the Iraqi people, whether compared with the methods adopted by the American people during the War of Independence, or compared with the methods used by the Faisal dynasty to deal with the Iraqi people, should be said to be very lenient and "very civilized." During their rule in Iraq, the Faisal dynasty used various cruel means to kill and imprison thousands of revolutionary patriots and patriotic people. In the recent ten years alone, they killed 15,000 Iraqi communists, and in February 1949, they hanged Comrade Fahd, the General Secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, and Comrades Basim and Shabibi, members of the Political Bureau. After the establishment of the Iraqi revolutionary government, it only conducted trials of these traitors and executioners in accordance with the law. The original King Faisal, Crown Prince Illah, and Prime Minister Said and others were killed because they first fired or ordered to fire on the masses. Eisenhower's slander of the Iraqi revolution as barbaric is, in fact, his own dispatch of troops to the Middle East to suppress the national liberation movement of the Arab people (the nature of this movement is the same as the American War of Independence), which is absolutely barbaric.

    2. The victory of the American War of Independence is inseparable from the multifaceted assistance from foreign countries, especially military assistance. Before the American War of Independence began, it actively carried out activities to seek international assistance. In 1775, the Continental Congress sent people to contact the famous French playwright Beaumarchais, and through his activities, obtained assistance from the French government. In March 1776, the American Continental Congress sent Silas Deane as an envoy to France, and sent Franklin and Samuel Chase and others as envoys to Canada to carry out activities to win the assistance of these two countries. In September of the same year, the Continental Congress sent Franklin and Arthur Lee to France to strive for the conclusion of commercial and alliance treaties with France. In October, Deane obtained from the French government military uniforms sufficient for 20,000 soldiers and weapons sufficient for 30,000 soldiers. In February 1778, the United States and France officially signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, France recognized American independence, and formally undertook the obligation to provide military assistance to the United States. In the first two and a half years of the War of Independence, 90% of the weapons used by American soldiers were shipped from Europe, especially from France. In addition, the United States obtained a large amount of economic assistance from France, Spain, and the Netherlands. From 1777 to 1783, the United States borrowed a total of 6.35 million US dollars from France, 170,000 US dollars from Spain, and 1.3 million US dollars from the Netherlands. Advanced people in Europe raised a total of 2 million pounds to support the struggle of the American people. More than 7,000 European volunteers participated in the American battle. French utopian socialist Saint-Simon, Polish patriots Pulaski and Kosciuszko all went to the United States to participate in the revolutionary struggle. Pulaski gloriously sacrificed on the battlefield of the American War of Independence. Russian democrat Radischev and others also expressed sympathy and support for the American revolution. At that time, the French Count de Rochambeau, Laurier, Prussian officer Steuben, and others came to the United States to participate in the war. Rochambeau led 5,500 people to the United States to participate in the war, while Laurier and Steuben trained infantry and cavalry for the United States respectively. The assistance of international friends played an important role in the victory of the American War of Independence.

    As for French military assistance, it further promoted the victory of the American War of Independence. In June 1778, French warships opened fire on British warships off the coast of France. In 1780, France sent an expeditionary force to the United States to participate in the war. Spain also joined the war against Britain because it formed an alliance with France in 1779. In 1780, the United States also obtained the moral assistance of the countries that declared "armed neutrality" (Russia, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Prussia, Austria, and the Two Sicilies). In 1782, the Netherlands joined the anti-British war and fought with the British army near the Caribbean Sea, hindering the actions of the British fleet. At this time, French Admiral de Grasse sailed from Sicily to the vicinity of Yorktown, giving the British army a heavy blow and prompting the British army to finally lay down their weapons. Britain was forced to negotiate peace with the United States.

    It can be seen from this that Eisenhower's attack on foreign aid to the struggle of the people of the Middle East is completely untenable: Since the American War of Independence could ask for foreign aid and receive foreign aid (including foreign volunteers, foreign arms aid, etc.), why don't the people of the Middle East have the same right? What's more, the American and British aggressors have already armed intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan, which makes it even more unreasonable for them to oppose the assistance of the Arab people and the people of other countries to the people of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq.

    美国独立战争是怎样对待反革命和怎样取得外国援助的
    问：1、艾森豪威尔15日演说污蔑伊拉克革命是“十分野蛮”的。我们从西方新闻记者从巴格达发出的电讯中，得不到这个印象。但是我们希望知道，美国独立战争时对于国内外敌人是采取了怎样的手段？他们所采取的手段同今天伊拉克人民对于反动王朝所采取的手段比较起来是否有所不同？
    2、艾森豪威尔指责伊拉克和黎巴嫩人民的斗争是受外国军事援助的结果，这同样没有根据，“人民日报”的社论已经驳斥了。社论中说到美国独立战争是受到外国军事援助并且有志愿军参战，这一点我们很希望得到比较详细的说明。
            读者汝颖  问汉
    答：你们的两个问题分别答复如下：
      （1）美国的独立是通过激烈的革命斗争和战争而获得的。在革命运动酝酿时期，美国人民就曾采取种种“非法”的革命“暴动”来反抗英国统治者。1765年在反抗印花税条例时，美国的爱国人民毁坏了关税巡逻船，封闭了法庭，并捣毁了税吏住宅，把税吏脸上涂上柏油，粘上羽毛，牵到街上去游行。1772年，英国派遣武装帆船“葛斯比号”巡视罗德岛海岸，取缔走私。美国的爱国志士在盛怒之下，把这只船捣毁了。1773年波士顿爱国青年化装为印第安人，踏上东印度公司的茶船，把全部茶叶倒在海里。等到独立战争爆发，十三州的人民赶跑了总督和英国官吏，推翻了英国的殖民政权，建立起革命政权，并采取紧急的革命措施，对当时在美国内部表示拥护英王的反革命分子“效忠派”，实施了专政。各州设立了安全委员会，褫夺了“效忠派”的公民权，没收了“效忠派”的财产，限制他们的言论、出版自由，不许他们进行拥护英王和反对独立的反革命宣传。由安全委员会没收的“效忠派”的财产达四千万美元。各州对于有投敌罪行的“效忠派”处以死刑，并制定种种法律，严格管制“效忠派”的活动。在纽约和新泽西，“效忠派”的律师不准开业；在宾夕法尼亚，“效忠派”药剂师不准营业。北部诸州大批逮捕“效忠派”，并将他们驱逐出境。在严厉的驱逐下，共有八万名“效忠派”逃回英国或西印度群岛。南部各州则普遍地依赖镇压手段来维持革命秩序。对于罪情较轻的“效忠派”，各州公安委员会也是把他们涂上柏油，粘上羽毛勒令游行示众。在战争时期，只有纽约州南部，“效忠派”聚集的地方，英军依靠“效忠派”的帮助，得暂时维持其血腥统治。很明显，美国人民用革命行动推翻“合法”的宗主国政权，并且采用革命措施，镇压内部的反革命分子的行为，是正确的和必要的。同样，今天的伊拉克人民对于费萨尔王朝采取的革命措施，也是完全正确的和必要的。事实上，伊拉克人民所采取的手段，无论同美国人民在独立战争时所采取的手段比较，或者是同费萨尔王朝对付伊拉克人民的手段相比较，都应该说是十分宽大和“十分文明”的。费萨尔王朝在他们统治伊拉克的期间，曾经用各种残酷的手段，杀死和监禁了成千上万的革命志士和爱国人民，仅仅在最近十年内，就杀死伊拉克共产党员一万五千人，并且在1949年2月绞死伊共总书记费哈德同志和政治局委员柏西姆同志和沙比比同志。伊拉克革命政府成立后，对这些卖国贼和刽子手们，也仅仅是依法进行审讯。原来的国王费萨尔，王储伊拉和首相赛义德等人所以被杀，是因为他们首先向群众开枪或下令开枪。艾森豪威尔污蔑伊拉克革命野蛮，其实他自己出兵中东镇压阿拉伯人民的民族解放运动（这种运动的性质同美国独立战争一样），才是十足野蛮的。
    2、美国独立战争的胜利同外国的多方面援助，特别是军事援助，是分不开的。美国独立战争开始以前，就积极地进行争取国际援助的活动。大陆会议曾在1775年派人和法国著名剧作家包马晒联系，通过他的活动，取得法国政府的援助。1776年3月，美国大陆会议派遣锡拉斯·狄安出使法国，派遣富兰克林和萨弥尔·蔡司等人出使加拿大进行活动，争取这两个国家的援助。同年9月，大陆会议又派遣富兰克林和亚塞·李到法国去，争取和法国订定商业条约和同盟条约。10月，狄安从法国政府方面，获得足供二万名士兵穿用的军服，足供三万名士兵用的武器。1778年2月，美国与法国正式签订了美法友好商务条约，法国承认了美国独立，并正式承担了在军事上援助美国的义务。在独立战争头两年半中，美国士兵所使用的武器有90％是从欧洲特别是从法国运去的。此外，美国更从法、西、荷等国获得了大量的经济援助。从1777年到1783年，美国共向法国借款六百三十五万美元，向西班牙借款十七万美元，向荷兰借款一百三十余万美元。欧洲先进人士共筹集了二百万镑来支援美国人民的斗争。欧洲有七千余志愿军参加了美国战斗。法国的空想社会主义者圣西门、波兰志士普拉斯基和库司休科都到美国参加了革命斗争，普拉斯基光荣地牺牲在美国独立战争的战场上。俄国的民主主义者拉吉谢夫等也对美国革命表示同情和支援。当时来到美国参战的还有法国的拉法叶脱·罗尚比伯爵、卢瑞尔等人和普鲁士军官斯徒本等人。罗尚比曾率领五千五百人到美国参战，卢瑞尔和斯徒本都替美国分别地训练了步兵和骑兵。国际友人的援助对于美国独立战争取得胜利起了重要的作用。
    至于法国的军事援助更促进了美国独立战争的胜利。1778年6月，法国战舰在法兰西濒海与英国战舰开火，1780年法国派遣远征部队抵达美国参战。西班牙由于在1779年同法国结盟，也参加了对英国的战争。在1780年，美国又取得了宣布“武装中立”的诸国（俄国、丹麦、瑞典、荷兰、普鲁士、奥地利和两西西里王国）的道义援助。1782年荷兰参加了反英战争，在加勒比海附近与英军发生了战斗，牵制了英国舰队的行动。这时，法国海军大将第格拉斯自西西里岛驶往约克镇附近，给予英军以沉重打击，促使英军最后地放下了武器。英国被迫同美国议和。
    由此可见，艾森豪威尔攻击外国援助中东人民的斗争是完全站不住脚的：既然美国独立战争可以要求外援并且得到外援（包括外国志愿军、外国军火的援助等等），为什么中东人民没有同样的权利呢？何况，美英侵略者已经武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的内政，这就使他们更没有理由来反对阿拉伯人民和其他国家人民对于黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克人民的援助了。
