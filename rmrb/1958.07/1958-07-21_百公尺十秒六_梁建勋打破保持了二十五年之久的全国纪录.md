    10.6 Seconds in the 100 Meters
    Liang Jianxun Breaks the National Record Held for Twenty-Five Years

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 20th. The national record of 10.7 seconds in the men's 100-meter sprint, which had been held for twenty-five years and was the only pre-Liberation record that had not been broken, was broken today by Liang Jianxun, an athlete from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with a time of 10.6 seconds! This is another exciting piece of good news from the great leap forward in our country's sports movement. As of now, all national records in sports created before Liberation have been broken.

    Liang Jianxun broke this 100-meter record in an exhibition match at the first People's Sports Games in Hexi District, Tianjin today.

    The sun was blazing in the stadium today, and the wind speed was 1.2 meters. After the referee fired the starting gun, Liang Jianxun had a very good start. When he finished the entire 100-meter course, the result was 10.6 seconds. After measuring the field and checking the wind speed, Liu Zhanfa, the head timekeeper and national track and field referee, announced on the spot that his new result of 10.6 seconds was completely valid.

    Since 1933, when sprinter Liu Changchun set the national record of 10.7 seconds in the 100 meters, no one has been able to break it for twenty-five years.

    百公尺十秒六
    梁建勋打破保持了二十五年之久的全国纪录
    据新华社天津20日电  保持了二十五年之久的、解放前唯一没有被打破的男子百公尺短跑十秒七的全国纪录，今天被中国人民解放军田径选手梁建勋以十秒六的成绩打破了！这是我国体育运动大跃进声中又传出的一个令人兴奋的喜讯。至此，解放前创造的所有体育项目的全国纪录都已被打破。
    梁建勋是在今天参加天津市河西区首届人民体育运动会的表演赛中，打破这个百公尺纪录的。
    今天运动场上烈日当空，风速是一点二公尺。梁建勋在裁判员发出信号枪后，起跑动作很好，当他跑完百公尺全程后，成绩为十秒六。接着经过丈量场地和检查风速。大会记时长、国家田径裁判柳占发当场宣布他的十秒六的新成绩完全合格。
    这在1933年，当短跑运动员刘长春创造了十秒七的百公尺全国纪录以后，二十五年来一直没有人能够打破它。
