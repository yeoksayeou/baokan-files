Starting from a Summer Night
By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

The night I arrived at a fishing ground guest house in Daishan County, Zhoushan Islands, I felt a bit tired and wanted to go to bed early. Just as I was dozing off, I suddenly heard a faint buzzing sound pass by my ear, and then I felt a small thing land on my face, which woke me up. It was then that I remembered it was summer and that I should put up the mosquito net. But when I opened my eyes, I saw that there was no mosquito net on the bed.

So, I had to wait quietly for the second, third…mosquito to attack, preparing to fight it. Who knew that after waiting for more than ten minutes, until I fell asleep, it never came again. I slept very soundly that night.

The next morning, I saw the old manager of the guest house holding a fly swatter, searching everywhere in the yard.

“Old comrade, can the rooms in the guest house all do without mosquito nets?”

He asked me in surprise, “What? Are there many mosquitoes?”

“No, I only encountered one.” I smiled and quickly reassured him.

“It’s too much trouble to put up a mosquito net for one or two mosquitoes. Not just our guest house, but in Gaoting Town—well, it’s the same everywhere on the island.” He shook the fly swatter and added, “Look, even flies, you can hardly find one in half a day.”

Later, I traveled south along the coast from the Zhoushan Islands to Dachen Island, passed through Wenzhou City, and entered the hinterland of southern Zhejiang, Lishui County. Along the way, except for a few towns, there were indeed very few mosquitoes and flies.

This matter aroused my great interest. Because I am also from Zhejiang, and I have personally suffered from mosquitoes and flies. My childhood was spent in the midst of mosquitoes and flies. Every summer and autumn, during the day, swarms of flies flew wantonly onto your face, hands, and thighs, and you couldn’t drive them away; at night, even more mosquitoes took turns attacking you, sometimes directly entering your ears and nostrils. On that street where people gathered to cool off, you could only hear countless banana leaf fans snapping frantically. I haven’t returned to Zhejiang for more than ten summers and autumns, but according to the people here, until last year, except for a few places, the situation had not changed significantly. Therefore, diseases were especially prevalent in summer and autumn. In just over half a year, the unprecedented upsurge of eliminating the four pests, wave after wave, has turned many urban and rural areas and islands into peaceful paradises where you don’t need to hang mosquito nets at night or cover food with gauze during the day. Many urban and rural areas have basically become areas free of the four pests.

Ant Island gave me a deep impression. This island doesn’t eliminate the four pests, but the eight pests. The other four pests are fleas, lice, cockroaches, and crickets. When I arrived on the island, I paid attention to observing, and even on the fish drying racks and in the processing rooms, I couldn’t find many flies. The gutters next to the houses in many villages are mostly paved with cement mixed with sand and soil, and you can’t see a single sewage ditch.

At the end of May, the cadres in charge of eliminating the four pests made the following assessment of Ant Island: After surveying two hundred households, 87% of the households were free of flies. One hundred percent of these two hundred households could sleep without mosquito nets, and only eleven households had heard the buzzing of one or two mosquitoes at night; after three days of a large-scale siege of sparrows, demolishing and sealing off more than 95% of the sparrow nests, it was difficult to see the shadow of sparrows. Now you will see that sometimes, when a fly or other pest is discovered, groups of three or five women and children immediately pursue it fiercely until it is eliminated.

This is what I saw and heard at sea. So, what is it like on the mainland?

I stayed in Wenzhou City for two days, inspected many streets, fish markets, public canteens, and some citizens' homes, and visited the Health Bureau. This is not only a clean city, but also a city that is moving towards beautification.

Or you could say, this is a city of flowers. Shops and residents' doors are indispensable with a pot of flowers. In the courtyards of many residents, there are also several kinds of potted flowers arranged, filling the courtyard with fragrance, and planting flowers has become a hobby of the citizens.

Here, let me describe the scenery of the "Cooling Garden."

One day, I walked into this "garden." At the entrance of the street, there were four horizontal plaques made of bamboo strips with the words "Cooling Garden" written on them. I almost thought it was a park. Upon closer inspection, it was just a small alley, and the place name was "Cooling Bridge." On one side, there were many neat rectangular flower beds planted with various flowers and trees, as well as many long stone benches, and each household also had its own potted flowers. Next to the flower beds, there was a newly built gravel road surface, which was originally a stinking river. In the past, swarms of mosquitoes bred here every year, disturbing the residents everywhere. This year, during the three-month movement to eliminate the seven pests, the residents fought hard for several days and nights, filled it in, and added some decorations, and the stinking river became a fragrant garden. Now, the residents all say: They sleep very soundly at night without mosquito nets.

Recently, the Wenzhou City Patriotic Health and Greening Movement Committee held a field meeting in this garden, and decided to launch a summer patriotic health movement month starting from June 15. The representatives learned from the "garden" residents' spirit of striving for the upstream and their experience, and resolved to eliminate the seven pests on a large scale, and further combine the elimination of the seven pests with greening and beautification, and turn Wenzhou City into a beautiful big garden in a short period of time.

Afterwards, I entered Lishui County in the mountainous area of southern Zhejiang. In the county seat, in Shuangxi Township, Yaxi District, more than 30 kilometers away from the city, and in Bihu Town, a plain 20 kilometers away from the city, everywhere I went, it was clean and tidy, which made people feel relaxed and happy. On a remote mountain village street, covered spittoons made of tile pots and fruit shell boxes made of brick or bamboo appeared everywhere. People from other counties who came here to visit exclaimed to me:

"You can see here to what extent Lishui has deepened the elimination of the four pests."

According to local cadres: If you are not careful and spit casually on the street, you will be interfered with by the children:

"Uncle, please spit into that spittoon."

You probably won't believe that this used to be such a mountain village: open and covered ditches were never dredged, and the streets were full of garbage and animal manure. If you were not careful when walking, you would step on a pile of manure; there was also a custom here of placing manure buckets everywhere on the streets. This was a sideline for women, and each manure bucket could earn fifty to one hundred yuan a year. It was truly "a bucket every three steps, a vat every seven steps." Every summer and autumn, the incidence of malaria, dysentery, and other diseases was very high. People from other places said that Lishui had three things in abundance: toilets, flies, and "hundred-day ghosts" (malaria). Local people also had a saying: "When the rice is harvested, the illness arrives." But since last year, no patients with malaria or dysentery have been found in the mountain villages.

The people of Lishui County are continuing to fight hard to achieve a "seven-free county" for the National Day. In the first half of this year, they launched ten county-wide blitz campaigns to eliminate the four pests, not including regional and regular small-scale activities. So far, nine townships have basically reached the seven-free standard, accounting for one-third of the county's twenty-seven townships. According to the analysis of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Inspection Team, in April, the pest elimination indicators had already exceeded the national and provincial average levels. The four pests have been nearly eliminated in large areas; and Lishui County's goal is to eliminate the seven pests, and they will not easily declare seven-free without repeated identification.

    从一个夏夜写起
    本报记者　张潮
    到达舟山群岛岱山县一个渔场招待所的那天晚上，已经感到有点疲乏，便想早点睡觉，正待朦胧入睡之际，突然听到低微的嗡嗡声从耳边掠过，然后发觉脸上落下一个小东西，把我刺醒了。这才想起现在已经是夏天，才想起去放蚊帐，可是，睁眼一看，床上并没挂蚊帐。
    于是，只好静候着第二只、第三只……蚊子来袭，准备跟它搏斗。谁知道，静候了十几分钟，直到我熟睡之前，它再也没有光临过。这一夜，睡得很甜。
    第二天早晨，我看见招待所的老管理员拿着一把蝇拍，在院子里到处搜索。
    “老同志，招待所的房间都可以不挂蚊帐了吗？”
    他惊异地反问我：“怎么？蚊子多吗？”
    “不，碰上过一只。”我笑笑，连忙安慰他。
    “为了一只两只蚊子挂蚊帐，够多麻烦。不光是我们招待所，高亭镇里——嗯，岛上哪里也一样。”他晃晃蝇拍，又补充了一句：“你看，就是苍蝇，半天也寻不上一只。”
    以后，我从舟山群岛沿海岸南下到大陈岛，经过温州市进入浙南腹地丽水县，一路之上，除了个别市镇外，确实都是蚊蝇无几了。
    这件事情引起我很大兴趣。因为我也是浙江人，亲身受过蚊蝇之苦。我的童年时期，就是在蚊蝇的纷扰中度过的。每当夏秋两季，白天，成群的苍蝇，肆无忌惮地飞到你的脸上、手上、大腿上来，赶也赶不走；晚上，更多的蚊子轮番向你围攻，有时直捣耳朵和鼻孔。在那条乘凉的街上，只听见无数芭蕉扇响得噼拍欲裂。我已经有十多个夏秋没有回过浙江，但是，据这里的人们说，去年以前，除了个别地方，情况并无显著变化。因此，夏秋之季，疾病也格外多。只不过半年多光景，一浪高一浪的史无前例的除四害高潮，就把许多城乡海岛变成夜不挂帐、昼不盖罩的安宁乐园，许多城乡基本上成了四无地区。
    蚂蚁岛上给了我一个深刻的印象。这个岛上不是除四害，而是除八害，另外四害是蚤、虱、蟑螂、灶鸡。我到岛上的时候，曾经留神观察，即使在晒鱼摊上，加工房里，也找不到几只苍蝇。许多村子的屋旁阳沟，多是用水泥掺合沙土铺成的，看不到一条污水沟。
    5月底，除四害干部曾经给蚂蚁岛作了这样一个鉴定：调查了二百户，无蝇户达到87％。这二百户，百分之百可以不下蚊帐睡觉，只有十一户晚上听到过一、二只蚊子的嗡嗡声；经过三天大举围剿麻雀，拆毁和封闭了95％以上的雀窝后，就很难看到麻雀的影子了。现在你会看到，有时发现了一只苍蝇或者别的什么害虫，便立刻有三五结队的妇女和儿童猛烈追击，直到把它消灭而后已。
    这是海上所见所闻。那么，大陆上又是怎样呢？
    我曾经在温州市住了两天，巡视过许多街道、鱼市场、公共食堂和一些市民家庭，访问过卫生局。这不但是一个整洁的城市，而且是一个正在走向美化的城市。
    或者可以说，这是一个花的城市，商店和居民的门口，少不得有一盆花儿。许多居民的庭院里，还排列着好几种盆花，满院芬芳，栽花成了市民的嗜好了。
    这里，让我描绘一下“乘凉花园”的景致吧。
    有一天，我走进了这个“花园”，街口排着四个用竹篾编成的写着“乘凉花园”的横额，几乎以为这真是一座什么公园。仔细一看，却是一条小巷，地名就叫“乘凉桥”。一边排列着许多整齐的长方形花坛，栽上了各种花木，还有许多长石凳，家家户户还有自己的盆花。紧靠着花坛的路上，有一道新砌的碎石路面，原来这是一条臭水河。过去，年年孳生成群的蚊子，到处侵扰居民。今年，在三个月的除七害运动中，居民们苦战了几个昼夜，把它填平了，加上一番打扮，臭水河便变成了香花园。现在，居民都说：晚上不挂蚊帐也睡得很甜。
    最近，温州市爱国卫生、绿化运动委员会在这个花园里召开了现场会议，决定从6月15日起开展夏季爱国卫生运动月。代表们学习了“花园”居民的力争上游的劲头和经验，决心大除七害，并把除七害和绿化美化进一步结合起来，在短期内把温州市变为美丽的大花园。
    随后，我进入浙南半山区的丽水县。在县城里，在离城三十多公里的山区——雅溪区的双溪乡，在离城二十公里的平原——碧湖镇，所到之处，都是干干净净，使人心旷神怡。一个偏僻的山村街道上，也处处出现了有盖的以瓦盆代替的痰盂和砖砌或者竹制果壳箱。同行的外县来此参观的人，惊叹地对我说：
    “你可以在这里看到丽水除四害深入到什么程度了。”
    据当地干部说：如果你不留神，在街上随便吐痰，便会受到小孩子们的干涉：
    “叔叔，请你吐到那个痰盂里。”
    你大概不会相信这儿曾经是这样的山村：阴沟阳沟从不疏通，满街垃圾、畜粪，走路时一不小心，就会踩上一脚粪；这儿还有一种习惯，街上到处放粪桶，这是妇女的一项副业门路，每年每只粪桶可收入五十到一百元。真个是“三步一桶，七步一缸”。每到夏秋，疟疾、痢疾等发病率很高，外地来的人说丽水有三多：厕所多，苍蝇多，“百日鬼”（疟疾）多。当地群众也有一句俗话：“稻割好，毛病到”。但是从去年以来，山村没有发现过患疟疾和痢疾的病人。
    丽水县人民正在为争取国庆节实现“七无县”而持续地苦战着。今年上半年，他们就发动过十次全县规模的除四害突击运动，这还不包括地区性的和经常性的小规模活动。到目前为止，基本上达到七无标准的有九个乡镇，占全县二十七个乡镇的三分之一，据浙江省委检查团分析，在4月间，灭害指标就已经超过了全国、全省的平均水平。在大面积地区已接近消灭四害；而丽水县的目标是消灭七害，不经过反复鉴定，他们是不轻易宣布七无的。
