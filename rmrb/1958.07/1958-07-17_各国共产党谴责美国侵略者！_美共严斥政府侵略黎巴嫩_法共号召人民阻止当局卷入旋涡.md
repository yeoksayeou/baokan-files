Xinhua News Agency, July 16th, TASS New York, July 15th: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press, severely condemning the landing of US Marines in Lebanon. The statement said: "Sending American troops to Lebanon is an act of imperialist aggressive interference in the internal affairs of this country. This action threatens the national independence and sovereignty of all Arab countries. Like the invasion of Egypt in October 1956, this action risks dragging the entire Middle East into armed conflict. This action threatens world peace and threatens the lives and safety of the American people no less than those of other countries...

This action is the inevitable result of the Eisenhower Doctrine, which stipulates that, for the benefit of the oil trusts, interference in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries can bypass the United Nations and violate the UN Charter and principles... We American communists, like millions of other Americans, are deeply disturbed by this action. Together with them, we say: stop evading United Nations action, abide by the principles of the Bandung Conference..."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 16th: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on July 15th, calling on the French working class and all the people to be vigilant and take united action to prevent the French authorities from participating in armed intervention in the Middle East.

The statement first pointed out that the landing of American troops in Lebanon was with the full consent of the British and French governments. This aggressive act by the imperialists is an extremely serious threat to world peace.

The statement reminded the people to pay attention to the fact that de Gaulle had recently expressed his willingness to work with other Western countries to maintain their strategic position and imperialist privileges in Lebanon and the entire Middle East. The recent cabinet meeting further confirmed this intention. The statement expressed firm opposition to any interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Iraq. The statement emphasized that the only policy that conforms to the internationalist tradition of the French people and the interests of France is to abandon any use of force, fully recognize the rights of the people of Lebanon and Iraq, fully recognize the right of the people of all colonies and dependencies to enjoy sovereignty and independence, and thus establish a new type of relationship with them on the basis of free consent, equality and mutual benefit. This is the only policy that befits France's honor and great future.

    各国共产党谴责美国侵略者！
    美共严斥政府侵略黎巴嫩
    法共号召人民阻止当局卷入旋涡
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社纽约15日讯：美国共产党全国委员会向报界发表声明，严厉谴责美国海军陆战队在黎巴嫩登陆。声明说：“派遣美国军队到黎巴嫩是对这个国家内政进行帝国主义侵略干涉的行动。这种行动威胁着所有阿拉伯国家的民族独立和主权。如同1956年10月侵入埃及一样，这种行动有把整个中东拖入武装冲突的危险。这种行动威胁着世界和平，并且使美国人民的生命和安全受到不比其他国家人民小的威胁……。
    这种行动是艾森豪威尔主义的不可避免的结果，艾森豪威尔主义为了石油托辣斯的利益，规定可以绕过联合国和破坏联合国宪章和原则来对中东国家的事务进行干涉……我们美国共产党人同千千万万其他美国人一样，对这种行动深深地感到不安。我们同他们一起说：停止回避联合国的行动，遵守万隆会议的原则……”。
    新华社巴黎16日电　法国共产党政治局7月15日发表声明，号召法国工人阶级和全体人民提高警惕，并且采取一致行动，以便阻止法国当局参加对中东的武装干涉。
    声明首先指出：美军在黎巴嫩登陆是取得了英法两国政府充分同意的。帝国主义者的这种侵略行动是对世界和平极其严重的威胁。
    声明提醒人民注意：戴高乐最近曾经表示，愿意同西方的其他国家一起来维护它们在黎巴嫩和整个中东的战略地位和帝国主义特权。前不久举行的内阁会议更证实了这种意图。声明表示坚决反对对黎巴嫩和伊拉克的内政进行任何干涉。声明强调说，唯一既符合法国人民国际主义传统又符合法国利益的政策是：摈弃任何方式的使用武力、充分承认黎巴嫩和伊拉克两国人民的权利、充分承认所有殖民地和附属国人民享有主权和独立的权利，从而在自由同意、平等和互利的基础上同他们建立新型的关系。这才是唯一符合法国的荣誉和伟大前途的政策。
