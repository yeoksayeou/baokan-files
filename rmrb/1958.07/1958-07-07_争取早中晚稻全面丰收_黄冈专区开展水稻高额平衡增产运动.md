    Strive for a Comprehensive Bumper Harvest of Early, Mid, and Late Rice
    Huanggang Special Zone Launches a High-Yield, Balanced Rice Production Campaign
    According to the Hubei Daily, the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site rice meeting in Qichun County on June 23rd and 24th to analyze the early rice growth situation in the entire area, summarize Qichun's experience in large-scale balanced early rice production increase, and guide rice production in the entire area. At the meeting, in the spirit of continuous revolution, it was proposed to increase effort and measures to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, to have single-season late Japonica rice compete with early rice, and to have late rice surpass early rice. A high-yield, balanced rice production increase campaign was immediately launched throughout the area, striving to break through the originally set rice production leap forward targets for the entire area.
    The first secretaries and agricultural technical cadres of the county committees attending the meeting, led by Jiang Yi, first secretary of the prefectural committee, and Lian Xisheng and Liu Jiangfeng, secretaries of the secretariat, adopted a combination of whirlwind tours and focused in-depth visits to summarize Qichun County's experience in large-scale balanced early rice production increase and, based on Qichun County's experience, studied rice production in various regions. Qichun County's early rice generally grew with thick stalks and long ears. Few third-class seedlings were seen in mountainous, plain, hilly, and lakeside areas. Everyone believed that Qichun County's average early rice yield of 1,200 jin per mu was entirely possible. According to the calculations of the Qichun County Committee and agricultural technical cadres, of the county's 207,000 mu of early rice, it is estimated that 70,000 mu will yield more than 1,500 jin per mu, 100,000 mu will yield around 1,100 jin per mu, 30,000 mu will yield around 700 jin per mu, 5,000 mu will yield more than 3,000 jin per mu, and a few will reach 4,000 to 5,000 jin. The growth of mid-season rice in Qichun County is also very balanced, and the seedlings of single-season late Japonica rice have turned green.
    Why can Qichun County achieve large-scale balanced early rice production increases, and why is the production of mid-season rice and single-season late Japonica rice also grasped so well in a series of linked efforts? Through on-site visits and summarizing experiences, it was unanimously agreed that the main reason was that they grasped the "key link" of rectification, and through rectification, cadres and the masses were continuously encouraged to work hard and strive for the upper reaches, and the general line was specifically implemented in rice production. Before the rapid transplanting of early rice seedlings, the Qing Shiling Township, located in a large mountainous area, suffered hail damage to wheat and rapeseed. Many cadres believed that "if the first shot is not fired well, the annual leap forward plan is finished." The township's Party branch, in accordance with the county committee's instructions to break all theories of conditions, habits, and conclusions, thoroughly oppose conservative thinking, and resolutely realize the Great Leap Forward, successively held meetings for cadres and the masses to strive for the upper reaches, asking everyone to discuss whether to be pessimistic and disappointed or continue to leap forward in the face of disaster? Whether to strive for the upper reaches or be content with the middle reaches in socialist construction? Through extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, pessimism and despair and fear of difficulties were criticized. The heroic slogan of "Wheat didn't catch early rice, oil crops lost plant peanuts, disaster doesn't reduce production, resolutely leap forward" was unanimously put forward, and finally, all difficulties were overcome, enabling early rice production in the large mountainous area to leap forward as greatly as in the plain areas. The township originally planned to produce 1,000 jin per mu of rice in two seasons this year. Now, a single season of early rice can yield 1,800 jin per mu, exceeding the average single-season yield of rice last year by more than 500 jin and more than twice as much. The Qichun County Committee promptly and vigorously promoted Qing Shiling Township's experience of closely integrating rectification with production and promoting production. While grasping the three key factors for increasing production—deep plowing, close planting, and fertilizer—it resolutely seized the season for transplanting and field management, so that the entire early rice growth process, from transplanting to topdressing, from weeding to protecting seedlings, protecting tillers, and protecting grains, was a courageous advance with full effort.
    At the on-site meeting, everyone believed that implementing the general line and striving to break through the originally set rice production targets was a struggle, and it was necessary to constantly overcome various ideas of being content with the middle and lower reaches. For example, some people shouted "it's settled," and there is no room for effort, which is nothing more than the trouble caused by not seeking progress and being content with the middle and lower reaches. In fact, where is it "settled"? Early rice still needs sufficient moisture, still needs to prevent lodging, and still needs to be harvested carefully; mid-season rice is still in a time of arduous struggle; late rice production has only just begun and is far from being settled. Therefore, for some people who emphasize that the place is not good, the conditions are too poor, so they cannot develop at a high speed and can only fall behind, and cannot compete with brother regions, these ideas must be criticized. The meeting also emphasized that in order to realize the general line faster and better, it is necessary to firmly believe in the masses and boldly mobilize the masses. Striving to break through the originally set rice production targets can be achieved.
    At the on-site meeting, Jiang Yi, first secretary of the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, asked everyone to learn from the leadership style and rice production experience of the Qichun County Committee, and to immediately launch a high-yield, balanced rice production increase campaign throughout the area, striving for early, mid, and late rice in the entire area to achieve large-scale balanced production increases.

    争取早中晚稻全面丰收
    黄冈专区开展水稻高额平衡增产运动
    据湖北日报讯  6月23、24日两天，中共黄冈地委在蕲春县召开水稻现场会议，分析全区早稻生长情况，总结蕲春早稻大面积平衡增产经验，指导全区水稻生产。会上按照不断革命论的精神，提出加干劲、加措施，早稻要保住丰收，一季晚粳要与早稻比赛，晚稻要超过早稻。在全区内立即开展一个水稻高额平衡增产运动，力争突破全区原订的水稻生产跃进指标。
    出席会议的各县县委第一书记和农业技术干部，在地委第一书记姜一、书记处书记廉希圣、刘江峰的带领下，采取走马观花和重点深入相结合的参观办法，总结了蕲春县早稻大面积的平衡增产经验，并根据蕲春县的经验，研究了各地区的水稻生产。蕲春县的早稻普遍长的秆粗穗长，无论山区、平原、丘陵和滨湖地区都很少看到三类苗，大家认为：蕲春县早稻平均亩产一千二百斤完全可能。按照蕲春县委和农业技术干部的测算，全县二十万七千亩早稻，预计亩产一千五百斤以上的有七万亩，亩产一千一百斤左右的有十万亩，亩产七百斤左右的有三万亩，亩产三千斤以上的有五千亩，少数可达四千到五千斤。蕲春县的中稻生长也很平衡，一季晚粳秧苗已转青。
    蕲春县的早稻为什么能大面积平衡增产、中稻和一季晚粳的生产也是一环套一环的抓得好呢？通过现场参观、总结经验，一致认为主要是抓住了整风之纲，通过整风使广大干部和群众不断鼓足干劲，力争上游，在水稻生产中具体贯彻了总路线。在快插早稻秧前，位于大山区的青石岭乡，小麦和油菜都受到冰雹灾害，不少干部认为：“头一炮没有打响，全年的跃进规划完蛋了。”这个乡的党支部，根据县委关于打破一切条件论、习惯论、定局论，彻底反对保守思想，坚决实现大跃进的指示精神，先后在干部和群众中召开力争上游会，让大家讨论在灾害面前是悲观失望还是继续跃进？在社会主义建设中是力争上游还是甘居中游？通过大鸣大放大字报大辩论，批判了悲观失望情绪和畏难思想，一致提出“小麦没有抓早稻，油料丢了种花生，受灾不减产，坚决大跃进”的豪迈口号，终于战胜了一切困难，使大山区的早稻生产同平原地区一样大跃进。全乡原来规划今年水稻两季亩产一千斤，现在一季早稻每亩就可收一千八百斤，超过去年全年水稻平均单产五百多斤的两倍多。蕲春县委及时大张旗鼓地推广了青石岭乡整风紧密结合生产和推动生产的经验，在抓好深耕、密植、肥料三大增产关键的同时，坚决抢好插秧和田间管理季节，使全县全部早稻生长过程从插秧到追肥，从薅草到保株保刁保粒，都是干劲十足地奋勇前进。
    在现场会上，大家认为贯彻实现总路线，力争突破原订的水稻生产指标是一场斗争，必须不断地战胜各种甘居中游和下游的思想。如有些人喊“定局了”，没有努力的余地了，无非是不求上进，甘居中游和下游的思想作怪而已。其实哪里就“定局”了呢？早稻还要有足够的水分，还要防止倒禾，还要细打细收；中稻还正是艰苦奋斗的时候；晚稻生产还才开始，还远说不上定局。因此对于有些人强调地方不好，条件太差，因此不能高速度发展，只能落后，不能与兄弟地区竞赛，这些思想都必须批判。会上还着重强调要更快更好地实现总路线，必须坚定地相信群众，放手地发动群众。力争突破原订水稻生产指标才能实现。
    在现场会上，中共黄冈地委第一书记姜一要求大家学习蕲春县委的领导作风和水稻生产经验，要在全区内立即开展一个水稻高额平衡增产运动，争取全区早、中、晚稻都能获得大面积平衡增产。
