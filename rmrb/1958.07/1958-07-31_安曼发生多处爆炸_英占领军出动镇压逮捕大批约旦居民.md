Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 29th. Cairo newspapers published news from Jordan stating that the Jordanian people are angrily protesting the intrusion of British occupation forces into Jordan. According to "Al-Shaab" (The People) newspaper, Jordanian King Hussein has used troops to suppress the people's actions.

"Al-Shaab" wrote that Jordanian troops and residents engaged in fierce fighting near the village of Kafr Sur. The newspaper, citing Ramallah radio, pointed out that armed conflicts between the military and civilians also occurred in other areas of Jordan.

"Al-Shaab" wrote that the authorities conducted large-scale arrests of patriotic residents. Among those arrested were Deputy Minister of Economy and Commerce, Hamad Farham, and twelve Jordanian officers and soldiers, because they expressed indignation at the British occupation of Jordan. Also arrested were Gabia, a member of the Jerusalem Municipal Council, and several lawyers.

"Al-Shaab" said that Jordanian authorities had cut telephone lines between Jordan and Syria. Army posts were set up along the highway from Amman to the Syrian border. British troops, including the air force, frequently patrol throughout Jordan. These measures are taken out of fear of the increasingly strong anger of the Jordanian people against the British armed occupation.

"Al-Shaab" also said that Hussein is mentally disturbed. Doctors said his condition is close to madness.

The newspaper reported that Jordan is in a severe economic crisis. Commerce is in decline, many merchants are on the verge of bankruptcy, and unemployment is widespread throughout the country.

    安曼发生多处爆炸
    英占领军出动镇压逮捕大批约旦居民
    新华社开罗29日电　开罗报纸发表来自约旦的消息说，约旦人民愤怒抗议英国占领军侵入约旦。据“人民报”报道，约旦国王侯赛因动用了军队来镇压人民的行动。
    “人民报”写道，约旦军队和居民在卡夫尔逊村附近发生了激战。这家报纸引用拉马拉市电台的消息指出，约旦其他一些地区也发生了军民的武装冲突。
    “人民报”写道，当局对爱国居民进行了大规模逮捕。在被逮捕的人当中有经济和商务部副大臣哈迈德·法哈姆和十二名约旦官兵，因为他们对英军占领约旦表示愤慨。另外被捕的还有耶路撒冷市政委员会委员加比亚和几名律师。
    “人民报”说，约旦当局已经切断了约旦和叙利亚的电话线。在安曼到叙利亚边境的公路沿线设有军队岗哨。英国军队包括空军在约旦各地经常进行巡逻。采取这些措施都是因为害怕约旦人民越来越强烈的反对英国武装占领的愤慨情绪。
    “人民报”还说，侯赛因的神经失常。大夫说，他的病情近似发疯。
    这家报纸报道说，约旦正处在严重的经济危机中。商业衰退，许多商人处在破产的边缘，全国各地普遍发生失业现象。
