Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 7th: Electric lights have been successfully installed using telephone lines on the Jining-Erlian Railway, which runs through the central part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Now, all stations along the line are brightly lit.

On the Ji-Er Railway, only four major stations, including Jining and Erlian, had electric lights in the past, while the remaining eighteen intermediate small stations had no electric lights. Therefore, although this railway had advanced equipment, it could not fully exert its effectiveness. In particular, the signal lights at each station were replaced with kerosene lamps, which not only had a short signal display distance, but also affected the train's travel speed.

Cui Lanting, a technician and member of the Communist Youth League at the Tumurt railway electrical testing lab on the Ji-Er line, devoted more than a month of painstaking research to solve this problem, and finally recently succeeded in creating a method of installing electric lights by transmitting electricity using telephone lines.

    电话线上装电灯
    集二铁路沿线大放光明
    据新华社呼和浩特7日电  在纵贯内蒙古自治区中部的集宁—二连铁路上，最近利用电话线送电安装电灯成功。现在，沿线所有车站都大放光明。
    在集二铁路上，过去除了集宁、二连等四个大站有电灯以外，其余十八个中途小站都没有电灯。因此，这条铁路虽然有先进的设备，但是却不能充分发挥效能；尤其是各站的信号灯，都用煤油灯代替，不仅信号显示距离太近，影响列车行进速度。
    集二线土木尔台电务试验室技术员、共青团员崔兰亭，为解决这个问题，经过一个多月苦心钻研，终于在最近创造成功了利用电话线送电安装电灯的方法。
