Don't Be a Doctor Who Only Prescribes Sleeping Pills

	Shortly after Lieutenant Military Doctor Leng Yan was transferred to work in the internal medicine outpatient department of a military medical school's affiliated hospital, she discovered that there were many patients with neurasthenia. However, her own clinical experience was limited, and her knowledge of neurology was even less. When she saw patients, she could only routinely prescribe some sleeping pills and sedatives, offer a few words of comfort, and tell them to go home.

	Once, a patient with neurasthenia saw that the prescription was for sleeping pills again, and angrily threw the prescription on the table and turned to leave. Leng Yan was very surprised and stopped him. The patient said, "This disease has plagued me for many years. I can't sleep at night, I don't want to eat during the day, and my body is so weak that a gust of wind can blow me over. Many experts have seen me, and I have taken all kinds of sleeping pills..." He asked Leng Yan, "Doctor, can you only prescribe some sleeping pills too?"

	These words gave Leng Yan great stimulation and enlightenment. She thought: I am a Communist Party member, and the Party wants me to relieve patients' suffering. How can I be a doctor who only prescribes sleeping pills? These questions made her restless. She resolved to study a new therapy for treating neurasthenia to relieve patients' suffering.

	She read many magazines and literature and found a lecture on "The Principle of Novocaine Block Therapy." Based on this principle, she inferred that novocaine might be effective in treating neurasthenia. She decided to try a small amount of novocaine (0.25%). So she discussed it with the patient who didn't want to take sleeping pills last time, and after obtaining his consent, the new therapy began.

	However, fifteen days passed, and there was no effect. Then, a second treatment was performed. But it still failed.

	What was the reason? Was the therapy ineffective, or was the medical history too long? Was the dosage insufficient, or was there a problem with the concentration of the drug? ... Leng Yan was troubled by these questions, unable to eat or sleep. She flipped through many books and magazines and indeed found that there was a problem with the dosage concentration of the drug. She decided to change the concentration from 0.25% to 0.5%, with an initial dose of 15cc.

	After two weeks, the patient suddenly ran over excitedly and told Leng Yan: "I slept for three and a half hours last night, which is the best I've slept in years!"

	Leng Yan was as happy as the patient. She also kindly discussed with the patient: "Let's consider this treatment as the first course! Let's prepare for the second..." The patient was in high spirits and agreed to continue the treatment. After completing the second course, the patient said that the sleep time increased to four to five hours, and the appetite also increased. This indicated that the neurasthenia had improved. The patient took the initiative to request a third course. After completing the third course, the daily sleep time increased to seven to eight hours. It can be said that his illness was cured.

    不作只会开安眠药的医生
    上尉军医冷严被调到某军医学校附属医院门诊内科工作不久，就发现神经衰弱的病人很多。可是，她自己的临床经验很少，对神经科的知识更少，遇到病人时，只能照例开一些安眠药镇静剂，安慰几句，叫病人回去。
    有一次，一个神经衰弱的病人看到处方上又是开的安眠药，气得把处方扔到桌上，转身就走。冷严很奇怪，叫住了他。病人说：“这病已折磨我好多年，夜里不能安眠，白天不想吃饭，身体衰弱得一阵风就能吹倒了。多少专家给我看过，什么样的安眠药我都吃过，……”他问冷严：“医生同志，是不是你也只能开一点安眠药呢？”
    这一番话，给了冷严极大的刺激和启示。她想：我是个共产党员，党要我为病人解除痛苦，我怎么能作一个只会开安眠药的医生呢？这些问题，使她不能平静。她决心研究一种医治神经衰弱的新疗法，为病人解除痛苦。
    她翻阅了许多杂志和文献，从中找到了一本关于“奴夫卡因封闭疗法的原理”讲义。根据这个原理推断，奴夫卡因用在治疗神经衰弱方面可能有效。她决定用小量的奴夫卡因（0.25％）试试。于是她同上次来的那位不愿吃安眠药的病人商量，取得同意以后，新的疗法开始了。
    但是，十五天过去了，不见成效。接着，又进行了第二次治疗。但，仍然失败了。
    什么原因呢？是疗法无效，还是病史过长？是药量不够，还是药的浓度问题？……冷严为这些问题苦恼着，吃不下饭，睡不着觉。她又翻了不少书籍杂志，果然发现药的用量浓度有问题。她决定把浓度由0.25％改为0.5％，初给量15cc。
    经过两周时间，病人突然高兴地跑来告诉冷严：“昨夜睡了三个半小时，是这些年来睡的最好的一夜！”
    冷严和病人一样，高兴极了。她又亲切地跟病人商量：“咱们把这段治疗算作第一疗程吧！再准备第二个……”病人情绪很高，同意继续治疗。作完第二个疗程，病人说睡眠时间增加到四至五小时，食欲也增加了。这说明神经衰弱有了好转。病人主动要求作第三个疗程。作完第三疗程，每天睡眠时间增加到七至八小时，可以说，他的病好了。　（李振华）
