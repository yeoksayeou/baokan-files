Luoyang Successfully Experiments with Oxygen Blowing Steelmaking
Any Pig Iron Furnace Can Produce Molten Steel, Steelmaking Is No Longer Mysterious
    (Our Newspaper News) The steel casting group of the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant Technical School boldly and successfully experimented with "cupola furnace iron water oxygen blowing steelmaking," taking another leap forward in China's steelmaking technology.
    Using open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces for steelmaking is not uncommon, but using cupola furnaces (i.e., pig iron furnaces) to blow oxygen for steelmaking was still a blank slate in China. Last winter, after Britain successfully experimented with this method of refining low-carbon steel, they imposed a technological blockade on us. In order to quickly catch up with Britain and win glory for the motherland, the steel casting group requested to conduct experiments in April of this year, but the engineers and technicians replied, "Foreign countries have only just done it, this is steelmaking! It's not a game." As a result, it was delayed for more than a month in vain. Recently, they studied the general line, liberated their thinking, and with the support of the Party, began the experiment.
    Under the leadership of Han Gao, a Communist Party member and intern teacher, the 15 teachers and students in the group made the determination not to withdraw from the front line without victory. They groped for the "balance law of furnace burden" in failures, worked for six consecutive nights, and finally refined the first furnace of low-carbon steel on June 10.
    After scientific identification, the quality has caught up with Britain. The minimum carbon content that determines the fate of low-carbon steel reached 0.06%-0.08%, while the minimum carbon content in Britain reached 0.06%-0.07%. The phosphorus and sulfur content also met the quality requirements.
    This method of steelmaking is very simple. Regardless of the size of the enterprise or the quality of the equipment, all that is needed is a pig iron furnace, a non-carbonaceous molten iron ladle, and a certain amount of oxygen. Its basic principle is consistent with the principle of the Bessemer furnace. The cost is also very low. The first furnace of steel they refined weighed 250 kilograms, worth 600 yuan, while the cost was only about 35 yuan. With the "oxygen blowing steelmaking method," even the smallest and most rudimentary ironworks can turn pig iron into steel. The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant has decided that, under normal circumstances, it will not ask the state for steel this year.

### 洛阳试验吹氧炼钢成功  任何化铁炉都可出钢水，炼钢更不神秘了

    洛阳试验吹氧炼钢成功
    任何化铁炉都可出钢水，炼钢更不神秘了
    本报讯　洛阳矿山机器厂技工学校铸钢小组，大胆试验成功“冲天炉铁水吹氧炼钢”，使我国炼钢技术又跃进了一步。
    使用平炉、转炉、电炉炼钢，并不是什么稀奇的事，但是利用冲天炉（就是化铁炉）的铁水吹氧炼钢在我国还是一张白纸。去年冬季，英国试验成功这种炼低炭钢的方法后，就对我们进行技术封锁。为了迅速赶上英国，给祖国争光，铸钢小组在今年4月就要求进行试验，但是工程师、技术员给他们的回答是：“外国才搞成，这是炼钢！不是闹着玩的。”结果白白地拖了一个多月。最近，他们学习了总路线，解放了思想，在党的支持下，开始了试验。
    全组师生十五人在共产党员、实习老师韩高的领导下立下了不取胜利不下火线的决心，在失败中摸索到“炉料的平衡规律”，连着干了六个通宵，6月10日终于炼出了第一炉低炭钢。
    经过科学鉴定，质量已赶上英国。决定低炭钢命运的含碳量最低达到0.06％—0.08％，英国含碳量最低达到0.06％—0.07％。含磷、硫量也都达到质量要求。
    这种炼钢的方法非常简便，不论企业大小，设备好坏，只要有一个化铁炉，一个不含碳质的铁水包，和一定数量的氧气就行。它的基本原理和贝氏麦炉的原理一致。成本也很低，他们第一炉炼钢二百五十公斤，价值六百元，而成本仅三十五元左右。有了“吹氧炼钢法”那怕设备最简陋的小铁厂都能把生铁变成钢。洛阳矿山机器厂已决定在一般情况下，今年不向国家要钢材。
