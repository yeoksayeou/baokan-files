    Good Medicine for Eliminating Bureaucratic Airs

    The article "A Happy Meeting, Great Inspiration" published on page 2 of the July 1st People's Daily vividly reported the story of Chairman Mao meeting with Cui Xiyan, the head of the Yingju Cooperative. The demeanor of our great leader Chairman Mao, being approachable, amiable, and humble, along with his depiction of the motherland's future, deeply touched people's hearts. After reading it, it felt as though Chairman Mao was meeting not just Cui Xiyan alone, but the entire nation.

    Before this, the People's Daily had published similar communications, which were all very popular with readers. These types of articles inspire us to advance bravely for the construction and defense of our socialist motherland, and for those who still harbor petty interests, they are good medicine for eliminating bureaucratic airs.

    清除官气的良药
    7月1日人民日报第二版所载“幸福的会见，巨大的鼓舞”，生动地报道了毛主席接见应举社社长崔希彦的故事。我们伟大领袖毛主席平易近人、和蔼可亲、虚怀若谷的风度和他对祖国前途的描绘，深深地激动人心。读后感到毛主席所接见不只是崔希彦一个人，而是接见了全国人民。
    在这以前，人民日报曾登载过这类通讯，都深受读者欢迎。这类文章鼓舞着我们为建设和保卫社会主义祖国奋勇前进，而对于那些还有低级趣味的人，则是清除官气的良药。
