Yunxiao Successfully Consolidates All Newly Established Agricultural Middle Schools
(Our report) This reporter Lin Junqing and Liu Kuihua report: Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, has successfully consolidated all forty-two newly established agricultural middle schools and spare-time middle schools in the county. Since the beginning of the semester, there has not been a single dropout. According to statistics from twenty-five agricultural middle schools, the student attendance rate in each school generally reaches about 98%; the ideological mood of the teachers has also generally stabilized.

These schools were all newly established in early April, with a total of one thousand six hundred and forty-five students. After the schools were established, due to the low professional level of the teachers and the uneven level of the students, many students and parents still held a "wait-and-see" attitude towards the agricultural middle schools, so the schools were not very stable. The county immediately organized an inspection team, led by Mao Qiheng, the Minister of Propaganda of the Yunxiao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Director of the Education Bureau, to go deep into the grassroots and into the classrooms to listen to lectures, conduct inspections and give guidance. In mid-April, when Mao Qiheng and others went deep into the classroom of the Caipu Township Agricultural Middle School to listen to lectures, they found that the teacher of this middle school, Zeng Qingqin, lacked teaching experience, and the number of students attending the school quickly dropped to 85%. After research and analysis, Mao Qiheng and others believed that the lack of teaching experience was a common problem among new teachers, and it was a key issue in consolidating the people-run middle schools in the early stage of the semester. Therefore, they quickly held a training class for teachers of people-run middle schools throughout the county. The county leaders also organized new teachers to observe classroom teaching activities in the First Middle School, and transferred six primary school teachers with rich teaching experience to form a teaching guidance group, and mobilized public school teachers to guide the teachers of people-run middle schools in a contractual manner. The county was divided into six guidance areas, and the teachers of people-run middle schools were organized to prepare lessons collectively, observe and listen to each other's lectures, and conduct individual guidance. Now, most teachers have general teaching ability, and many people can prepare lessons independently and can explain agricultural technology courses in conjunction with current production.

The teachers of agricultural middle schools often visit the parents and students to understand their thoughts and carry out propaganda and education in a timely manner to prevent students from dropping out of school midway. Zeng Qingqin, a teacher at Caipu Township Agricultural Middle School, found that student He Ruitang did not come to class, so he visited his home and learned that He Ruitang's parents were worried that their son's schooling would excessively reduce the family's income. He and the township and commune cadres helped them calculate the detailed accounts, dispelled the concerns of He Ruitang's parents, and let his son continue to go to school. The number of students in this school has increased from twenty-three at the beginning of the semester to forty, and their academic performance is very good.

The Party committees of each township have very specific leadership over agricultural middle schools. The Party committees of Pumei Township and Xianshi Township found that some students lived far from the school and it was inconvenient for them to go home to stay and participate in labor, so they immediately helped them to board at nearby public primary schools and participate in the labor of agricultural cooperatives near the school, so that they could study with peace of mind.

The township and commune cadres actively support the agricultural middle schools. Many agricultural cooperatives have allocated a part of their land as experimental fields for agricultural middle schools to conduct agricultural knowledge classes and scientific and technological research.

Now, the schools have generally been put on the right track. The students' academic performance is generally in the 70s and 80s, and the students' labor is also very good. After some students have learned agricultural technology courses, they have become active members of the commune in promoting new technologies.

    云霄新办农业中学全部巩固
    本报讯　记者林俊卿、刘葵华报道：福建省云霄县出色地把全县四十二所农业中学和业余中学全部巩固下来，从开学到现在，没有出现一个流生现象。据二十五所农业中学统计，各校学生出席率普遍高达98％左右；教师的思想情绪也普遍稳定下来。
    这些学校都是在4月初新办起来的，共有学生一千六百四十五人。学校办起来以后，由于教师业务水平低，学生程度差参不齐，许多学生和学生家长对农业中学还抱着“试试看”的态度，因此各校都不很巩固。县里立即组织检查团，由中共云霄县委宣传部长毛启恒和教育局长带领，分片深入基层、深入课堂听课，进行检查指导。4月中旬，当毛启恒等深入到菜埔乡农业中学课堂听课时，发现这个中学的教师曾庆钦缺乏教学经验，到校学生很快下降到85％。毛启恒等研究分析以后，认为缺乏教学经验是新教师普遍存在的问题，是开学初期巩固民办中学的一个关键问题，于是便很快举办了全县民办中学教师训练班。县的领导上还组织新教师到第一中学观摩课堂教学活动，并抽调六个教学经验丰富的小学教师组成教学辅导组，发动公立学校教师以带徒弟的方式，包干辅导民办中学教师。全县划分六个辅导区，组织民办中学教师集体备课，互相观摩、听课和进行个别辅导。现在，大部分教师都已具有一般教学能力，很多人都能独立备课，能结合当前生产讲解农业技术课。
    农业中学的教师们经常访问学生家长和学生，了解他们的思想情况，及时进行宣传教育，不使学生中途停学。菜埔乡农业中学教师曾庆钦发现学生何瑞塘没来上课，就登门访问，了解到何瑞塘的父母耽心儿子上学后会过多减少家庭收入，他便和乡社干部帮助他们算了细账，解除了何瑞塘家长的顾虑，让儿子继续上学。这个学校的学生已由开学初期的二十三人增加到四十人，学习成绩都很好。
    各乡党委对农业中学的领导都很具体。莆美乡和仙石乡党委发现有些学生的家离学校较远，回家住宿和参加劳动都不方便，便立即协助他们寄宿到附近的公立小学和参加学校邻近的农业社劳动，使他们安心上学。
    乡、社干部对农业中学都积极支持。不少农业社划出一部分土地作为农业中学上农业常识课和进行科学技术研究的实验田。
    现在，各校已普遍走上正轨，学生的学习成绩一般都在七、八十分，学生劳动也很好，有些学生学了农业技术课以后，已成为社里推广新技术的积极分子。
