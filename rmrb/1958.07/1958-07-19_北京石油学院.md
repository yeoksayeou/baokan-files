    Beijing Petroleum Institute

    Beijing Petroleum Institute was founded in 1953. It is the first higher education institution of petroleum industry in China. Now it has five departments including geology, drilling and production, refining, machinery and industrial economy, under which there are ten majors including petroleum geology, geophysical exploration, drilling, oil extraction, petroleum engineering, synthetic petroleum, petroleum mining machinery, petroleum refinery machinery, storage and transportation, and industrial economics and organization. The total number of students reaches four thousand, and it will enroll one thousand two hundred undergraduate students this year.

    In recent years, the Petroleum Institute has sent more than 1,200 construction cadres to the motherland, most of whom have become the backbone of the petroleum industry front. For example, the first gushing well in the new Nanchong Oilfield in Sichuan was drilled by the well team led by Yu Wanxiang, a graduate of the Petroleum Institute in 1954; He Xianqun, the female technician who led the drilling of China's first 3,000-meter deep well, also graduated from this school. This year, 800 graduates will be投入 [tou ru] (plunge into; throw into; put into) the ranks of the great leap forward in the petroleum industry.

    Under the guidance of the policy of education serving politics and the combination of education and labor, in addition to the existing forty-eight laboratories, the teachers and students of Beijing Petroleum Institute have recently established a coal dry distillation plant with an annual output of 300 tons of oil, and another coal refining and synthesis plant with an annual output of 3,000 tons is also under construction.

    北京石油学院
    北京石油学院是1953年创建的。它是我国第一所石油工业的高等学校。现在设有地质、钻采、炼制、机械和工业经济等五个系，下设石油地质、地球物理探勘、钻井、采油、石油工学、人造石油、石油矿场机械、石油炼厂机械、储运和工业经济与组织十个专业。学生总数达四千人，今年将招收一千二百名本科学生。
    几年来，石油学院为祖国输送了一千二百多名建设干部，大都成为石油工业战线上的中坚力量。如四川南充新油区的第一口喷井是由石油学院1954年毕业生余万祥领导的井队打的；领导钻凿我国第一口三千公尺深井的女技术员贺仙群，也是从这个学校毕业的。今年将有八百名毕业生投入石油工业大跃进的行列中。
    在教育为政治服务、教育和劳动相结合的方针指导下，北京石油学院的师生在现有四十八个实验室以外，最近建立了一座年产三百吨油的煤成堆干馏厂，另一座年产三千吨的煤炼油合成厂也在兴建。
