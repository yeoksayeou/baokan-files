Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 3rd. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a crowded press conference held at Science Palace here this morning that the current events in Lebanon "are a matter to be decided by the Lebanese people themselves without any external interference."

    He warned that any external intervention could lead to various consequences, which might further expand the conflict.

    Referring to the Geneva expert meeting, Nehru expressed the hope that the experts would discuss these issues at a scientific and technical level rather than at a political level. He believes that this is easier to reach an agreement on. When asked whether the execution of Nagy could be an excuse for not holding a summit meeting, Nehru said, "In a strictly legal sense, what happened in Budapest is entirely an internal affair of the Hungarian government." He also said that "it would be very unfortunate if Nagy's execution became a reason not to hold a summit meeting to discuss issues." However, on the other hand, Nehru also believed that the Nagy execution had created suspicion and a very tense situation, causing a regression from the movement to ease tensions.

    He also said that he is not a Marxist, and therefore cannot express opinions on basic ideological issues such as revisionism.

    A reporter asked him if there would be any change in India's foreign policy given the expected loans from the United States. Nehru replied that India will eventually not rely on foreign loans. He said, "Our policy will not be affected by considerations of foreign loans." He also said that the Indian government will strive to obtain huge loans in the coming years. We welcome the United States and other countries to provide us with loans. Obviously, the United States is more capable of giving us huge loans.

    尼赫鲁在记者招待会上谈话
    反对外国干涉黎巴嫩
    新华社新德里3日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天上午在这里科学宫举行的拥挤的记者招待会上说，黎巴嫩目前所发生的事情，“是一个要由黎巴嫩人民在没有任何外来干涉的情况下自行决定的问题”。
    他警告说，任何外来干涉都可能导致各种后果，从而可能进一步扩大冲突。
    尼赫鲁在提到日内瓦专家会议时表示希望，专家们将在科学和技术水平上而不是在政治水平上讨论这些问题。他认为，这是比较易于达成协议的。尼赫鲁在答复纳吉被处决一事是否可成为不举行最高级会议的借口这个问题时说，“从严格的法律意义来说，布达佩斯所发生的事情完全是匈牙利政府的内政”。他还说“如果纳吉的被处决竟成为不举行最高级会议来讨论问题的理由”，那将是“非常不幸的”。但是另一方面尼赫鲁却又认为，纳吉伏法事件已经造成了猜疑和非常紧张的局势，已经使得从缓和紧张局势的运动倒退。
    他还说，他不是马克思主义者，因此无法就有关修正主义等等的基本的意识形态问题表示意见。
    有记者问他，鉴于可望从美国得到贷款，印度的外交政策是否将有任何改变。尼赫鲁回答说，印度最后将不依赖外国贷款。他说，“我们的政策将不会由于外国贷款的考虑而受到影响”。他又说，印度政府在今后几年内将努力取得巨额贷款。我们欢迎美国和其他国家向我们提供贷款。显然，美国是更能够给我们巨额贷款的。
