Title: Tension and Relaxation

There are still a few people who wear silk gowns and wave feather fans, always complaining with mournful faces, "Take your time and be leisurely, tranquility leads to far-reaching vision, slow work produces skilled craftsmen. You are too eager for quick success and instant benefits, not only will you not do things well, but people will also be too tense."

Indeed, our work is very intense. In a country like ours, with vast land, a large population, and utter poverty, how can we build a prosperous and happy new socialist society without working hard and pressing on? However, unfortunately, these gown-wearing gentlemen only see one side of our lives, the tense side; but they do not see the other side, the non-tense side, the relaxed side. They almost completely fail to understand that the reason why we work so hard is precisely to avoid tension; that intense work contains non-tension; and that the harder we work, the less tense we will become.

For example, recent news reports say that the people of Henan Province have built water conservancy projects, completing more than 8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work in just six months. The intensity of the work can be imagined. But the result is that the province has basically eliminated floods and droughts from now on. Anyone who knows the history of floods and droughts in Henan Province can certainly imagine how much more relaxed and happy the people of Henan should be now, how much less tense, compared to the previous tense situation.

Of course, we do not completely reject leisure and tranquility. However, leisure is spoken of in relation to busyness, and tranquility is spoken of in relation to excitement. In the midst of busyness and excitement, leisure and tranquility have positive significance. Endless leisure and tranquility lead to laziness, which is only bad for things and not good.

Therefore, our vast numbers of awakened cadres and masses are always like this: the more difficulties they encounter, the more vigorously they work; the more vigorously they work, the more happy and relaxed they are; the more they sacrifice themselves, the more open-minded they become; the more they think hard, the more clear-headed they become.

This principle has long become common sense for many people. But for those who are completely indifferent to floods and droughts, who do not care about the joys and sorrows of the people, and who only feel that it is better to take raw materials abroad to exchange for some ready-made things to enjoy than to work hard themselves, I am afraid they still cannot understand it.

In fact, some people who shout "tension" very loudly do not really need leisure and tranquility. They just want to free up more time to do something else.

There are several university professors who usually have quite a few opinions about the intensity of work. Once, in order to enable them to quickly compile textbooks, the state exempted them from their teaching tasks for the whole year. They finally had leisure. In the hot summer, they were specially rented high-class hotels by the sea to let them escape the heat, which was also quiet enough. However, as time went by, after more than a year, the work of compiling textbooks basically remained on the shoulders of some young assistants. The professors, however, used this "leisure" to busy themselves for their own purposes. Some sorted out old works, and some wrote new articles. It is a pity that some of the things written in a hurry could not even avoid obvious mistakes, let alone be profound.

From this, it can be seen that some people do not like quick success and instant benefits, they just do not like quick socialist success and instant socialist benefits. As for individualist success and benefits, the more hurried and immediate, the more enjoyable they are.

Therefore, when dealing with practical work, one has to put in a lot of thought. To be selfless and forgetful of oneself is too much sacrifice; to be selfish and forgetful of the public is not tolerated by public opinion; to cooperate with others is to have one's own achievements shared by others; to work alone is to not get the benefits of others; to make knowledge public is to damage exclusive possession; to keep it secret is difficult to become famous. It is truly a dilemma, difficult to move forward or backward. The tension of emotions is difficult for outsiders to understand. The only way is to complain.

Now, the situation is pressing, and even those who used to complain have to make a great leap forward. To make a great leap forward, of course, one must work hard on the socialist track. At first, it may not be very accustomed to it, however, in order to relieve ideological burdens, seek physical and mental comfort, and turn the chaotic passive situation into a calm and unhurried active situation, this is probably the only way.

    紧张和轻松
    戴鸿
    现在还有少数身穿绸长衫，手摇羽毛扇的人，老是哭丧着脸埋怨说：“好整以暇，宁静致远，慢工出巧匠呀。像你们这样急功近利，不但事情做不好，人也太紧张了。”
    的确，我们的工作很紧张。在我们这样一个土地辽阔，人口众多，一穷二白的国家，建设繁荣幸福的社会主义新社会，不大大地加油紧干怎么行？然而可惜，这些大褂先生们只看到了我们生活的一面，即紧张的一面；却没有看到另外一面，即不紧张的一面，轻松的一面。他们几乎完全不了解，我们所以工作紧张，正是为了不紧张；紧张的工作里面就包含着不紧张；我们工作越紧张，我们就会变得越不紧张。
    例如最近报上的消息说，河南省人民兴修水利，短短六个月内完成土石工八十亿多公方。工作之紧张，可以想见。但是其结果是全省从此基本上消除了水灾和旱灾。知道河南省历年水旱灾情的人，一定可以想像得出：比起以往那种紧张情况来，现在河南人民该有多么轻松愉快，多么不紧张。
    当然，我们也并不是完全不要闲暇和宁静。但是，闲暇是对着繁忙说的，宁静是对着激动说的。在繁忙和激动之中，闲暇和宁静才有积极意义。无止境地闲暇和宁静下去，就是懒散。对事情只有坏处，没有好处。
    因此，我们广大的觉悟了的干部和群众总是这样：越遇到困难，越干得起劲；越干得起劲，越愉快轻松；越自我牺牲，越胸襟开阔；越苦思苦想，越头脑清醒。
    这个道理，对很多人说来，早已成了常识。但是对于那些水旱灾害全不在意，人民苦乐与他无关，只觉得与其自己苦干还不如拿原料到外国去换点现成东西享受一番的人们，恐怕还是不能懂得的。
    其实，有些叫嚷“紧张”很厉害的人，也并不是真需要闲暇和宁静。他们只是想抽出更多的时间，去干点什么别的事情。
    有这么几位大学教授，平时对工作的紧张都是颇有意见的。有一回，国家为了使他们迅速编出教科书，就全年免去了他们的教学任务。总算有暇了。炎热的夏天还特别在海滨给他们租了高级旅馆，让他们去避暑，也够宁静了。然而，光阴荏苒，一年多的时间过去后，那编教科书的工作基本上还停留在一些青年助手的肩上。教授们却利用这个“闲暇”，为自己忙了个不亦乐乎。有的整理旧作，有的撰述新篇。只可惜匆忙写出来的东西，有的连明显的错误也不能避免，更谈不到甚么深远了。
    由此可见，有些人不喜欢急功近利，只是不喜欢急社会主义之功，近社会主义之利。而个人主义之功之利，则是越急越近，越过瘾。
    于是，处理实际工作时，就不得不大费一番心思。公而忘私罢，牺牲太大；私而忘公罢，舆论不容；与人合作罢，别人会分掉自己的功劳；自己单干罢，又得不到别人的好处；知识公开罢，有损独占；秘而不宣罢，又难以出名。真是进退维谷，左右为难。情绪之紧张，局外人是难以理解的。唯一的办法就只有叫苦了。
    现在呢，形势逼人，过去叫苦的也要跃进了。要跃进，当然就要在社会主义的轨道上紧张地工作起来。最初也许不太习惯，然而，要想解除思想负担，求得身心舒畅，变手忙脚乱的被动局面为从容不迫的主动局面，恐怕这还是唯一的途径。
