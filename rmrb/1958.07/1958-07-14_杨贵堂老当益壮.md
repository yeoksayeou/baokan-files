    Yang Guitang Remains Strong in Old Age

    One morning, a group of commune members from the Second Village Agricultural Cooperative of Gaohe Township, Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, marched in force up the mountains to develop sources of fertilizer. Leading the way was an elderly man – Grandpa Yang Guitang, who had served as the chairman of the district Soviet when the Red Army passed through here during the Long March in 1935. On the mountain, a sheer cliff of several yards high blocked their path. Many people were afraid to go up and stopped to rest at the foot of the rock. Grandpa Yang Guitang said, "The roads the Red Army traversed during the Long March were much more treacherous than this. Are you scared, cowards!" With that, he took the lead in climbing the steep rock face and reached the summit. Seeing how brave the old man was, the commune members scrambled to climb the rock as well. In this way, they found excellent decayed wood and mud, obtaining a large amount of good fertilizer.

    杨贵堂老当益壮
    一天早上，四川邛崃县高何乡二村农业社的一群社员，浩浩荡荡地上高山去开辟肥源。走在头里的是一位年迈的老人——1935年红军长征经过这里时，当过区苏维埃主席的杨贵堂老大爷。大伙儿在高山上，被一块几丈高的悬岩绝壁挡住了去路。许多人不敢上去，在岩石底下停下来歇息。杨贵堂老大爷说：“红军长征时经过的路比这艰险多了，怕?子！”说着就带头攀上峻陡的岩石，登上峰顶。社员们看到老人都这样勇敢，便也争先恐后地攀上岩石。就这样他们找到了很好的烂木泥，得到了大量的好肥料。
