Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th - Gan Yinfang, the leader of the 24th production team of the Chun Guang Agricultural Cooperative in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, and several members of the Communist Youth League, cultivated a plot of experimental land that launched a high-yield early rice "satellite." This experimental plot, totaling 1.613 mu, was harvested on the 28th and threshed on the 29th, yielding a total of 17,093 jin and 12 liang of dry grain, averaging 10,597 jin and 8 liang per mu.

This experimental plot was a lakeside field, and from the very beginning, its cultivators managed it with meticulous care. Last winter, it was plowed four times to a depth of more than one chi and seven cun. At the same time, they paid attention to fertilization: during plowing, 350 dan of lake grass were applied per mu; before transplanting, another 5,940 dan of pond mud were applied as base fertilizer; and after transplanting, 60 jin of ammonium sulfate were applied per mu as top dressing. This experimental plot used close planting, averaging 75,000 seedlings per mu.

Because of the sufficient fertilizer, the rice grew strong, with abundant tillering, large panicles, and full grains. On average, there were 20 panicles per seedling, 1.5 million panicles per mu, and 135 grains per panicle. The longest rice panicles reached eight cun in length.

During the harvest, the Yingcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specially sent representatives to congratulate the Chun Guang Cooperative.

Those who participated in the acceptance included: Liu Renshou, head of the Hubei Provincial Early Rice High-Yield Acceptance Team; Liu Jiaju, head of the Yingcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Acceptance Team; Sun Shixiong, secretary of the Baihu Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yingcheng County; and the secretary of the general branch of the Chun Guang Cooperative and representatives of the cooperative members, totaling more than 20 people.

    早稻亩产超过万斤
    春光社创10597斤高产纪录
    新华社武汉30日电　湖北省应城县春光农业社第二十四生产队队长甘银发和几个共青团员们合种的一块试验田，放出了一颗早稻高产“卫星”。他们的这块试验田共有一点六一三亩，28日收割，29日打完，共收干谷一万七千零九十三斤十二两，平均亩产达一万零五百九十七斤八两。
    这块试验田是块湖田，从一开始，试验田的主人就对它进行了精心的经营。去年冬天，翻耕了四遍，深耕一尺七寸多；同时，他们注意了施肥：在翻耕时，每亩施了三百五十担湖草；在插秧前，又施了五千九百四十担塘泥作底肥；在插秧后，每亩施硫酸铵六十斤作追肥。这块试验田是采用密植的，每亩平均七万五千兜。
    由于施肥足，稻子长得壮，分蘖多，穗子大，粒子饱。平均每兜有二十穗，每亩一百五十万穗，每穗一百三十五粒，稻穗最长的达八寸长。
    在收割的时候，中共应城县委特别派了代表前来给春光社祝贺。
    参加验收的有：湖北省早稻丰产验收组组长刘仁寿，中共应城县委验收组长刘家驹，中共应城县白湖乡委员会书记孙世雄，以及中共春光社总支书记和社员代表等共二十多人。（附图片）
