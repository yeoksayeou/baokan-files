Cheer Loudly for "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir"!
Ouyang Yuqian

Under the glorious illumination of the General Line, the people of the capital, with unparalleled socialist zeal, completed the great Ming Tombs Reservoir project, which has national and international significance, at an accelerated pace. Poets, musicians, painters, filmmakers, and opera workers have all reflected this in their works. How could the stage be absent? Thanks to Comrade Tian Han for rushing out such a script in three to five sleepless or short-sleeping nights, and thanks to the comrades of the China Youth Art Theatre for putting it on stage in a crash effort of less than a week! This performance not only carries forward the fighting tradition of Chinese drama but also has new expressions and achievements.

This play is an epic of magnificent scale and a lyrical poem expressing socialist enthusiasm. As a drama, whether in terms of playwrighting or directing, it breaks with conventions, creates new forms, and uses new techniques. To represent the heroic image of the builders of the Ming Tombs Reservoir project on stage, one must have the boldness to break with conventions and create new forms. The twelve scenes—reminiscing about the past, praising the present, and envisioning the future—are all handled with ease, completed in one go, and become a whole, truly demonstrating freedom and mastery, worthy of a great hand.

A play must write about relationships between people; neglecting this point and writing about the labor process is bound to fail. However, how to vividly introduce the labor enthusiasm of 400,000 people to the audience is a difficult problem. The author connects the entire play through a cultural慰劳团 (comfort group), interweaving some representative typical characters and typical events into a scroll, becoming a symphonic piece. Every character in the play is written realistically, and the introduction of their relationships is also clear and moving. Those labor heroes are all so simple, humble, and pure, and so brave and resolute when they work. They cooperate with each other, compete with each other, challenge each other, and care for each other, extremely intimate and harmonious. Especially, we see the collective and also see the individual. After watching this play, we can understand the relationship between the individual and the collective, that the individual can play a great role by wholeheartedly devoting oneself to the collective for a noble purpose.

The play writes about Professor Jian, who accepts labor training to transform himself, and also about backward intellectuals like Huang Zhongyun, and decadent writers like Hu Jintang, creating a sharp contrast. The interlude of the modern Chen Shimei and Qin Xianglian is meaningful, making the progress of the play more varied and colorful.

The play concludes with a vision of twenty years later, which is very good; it would be difficult to conclude it otherwise. The final scene is full of poetry and painting, full of hope and confidence; while maintaining vigilance in harmony and perfection, it strides boldly towards a happier future with a spirit of continuous revolution.

The performance method of this play is very appropriate. The director showed admirable talent. Such a play should not be restricted by the stage frame, but the director did not move most of the play outside the frame; he used all parts of the entire stage. The method of moving the distant, middle, and close views on the spot is very appropriate, otherwise, the play will be fragmented and unable to be completed in one go.

The continuous reporting teams walking onto the stage from several directions from the audience are very impressive, and the introduction of the heroes of each group is also concise and powerful through this way. The labor scenes are arranged on the stage—picking soil, pushing carts, ramming earth, etc., are intertwined, the formation, position, and walking lines flow and change, and attention is also paid to the color configuration of the costumes, forming a vivid stage picture. The stage is full of people, men and women, old and young, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, various characters coming and going in teams and groups, working together. The ramming song is extremely good! It makes people excited and want to jump onto the stage to sing and work with them. If this kind of scene is not handled properly, it is easy to be dull, rigid, and chaotic; but what we see is a brightly colored picture, a rhythmically ordered movement. It looks like a blooming brocade, and it sounds like the tinkling of jade. Ah, the tension and joy of labor, the beauty of labor! Someone asked: Is it possible to exaggerate the labor movements more, to make them more dance-like? I think this is not a dance drama after all, and appropriate processing like this is very good. If the dance part is too prominent, it may make the style of the whole play difficult to harmonize.

The last scene writes about things twenty years from now. This is not fantasy, but a factual prediction based on concrete analysis, perhaps even somewhat conservative. That long song is handled very well, and the melody is also very good. I don't quite agree with the term "drama plus singing," because it is easy to cause misunderstanding. The several songs in this play are necessary, and each song is arranged appropriately and configured naturally, which can enhance the effect of the play. The earth-ramming song that resounds through the sky plays a great role in inspiring people. But the form of this play is still a drama. In a drama, singing and music can be added as much as possible on necessary occasions, but there is no need to regard drama plus singing as a fixed form. How to use instrumental and vocal music in a play is something that writers and directors can freely handle.

The 400,000 heroes of the Ming Tombs Reservoir created a miracle with soaring enthusiasm, and the playwright wrote the script in three to five days with soaring enthusiasm; directors, actors, musicians, stage workers, etc., also put the play on the stage in less than a week with soaring enthusiasm. The play is so good, so moving, who dares to say that rushing to complete a task cannot produce good things! The main thing is whether you have political enthusiasm, revolutionary drive, and artistic accomplishment. This performance is one of the good examples of more, faster, better, and more economical results, striving for the upstream. At the end of the play, someone said: "The author is really a genius." The Mao Zedong era will surely produce many talented artists; the cultivation of the Party, the tempering of the revolution, the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward in production, the enlightenment of the masses, the individual's humble learning, and the drive to strive for the upstream are the foundations of genius; without these conditions, there can be no genius. In today's era when the people are the masters of their own house, the Ming Tombs Reservoir can be built; Guan Hanqing will also receive a correct evaluation. Times create heroes, and it is by no means accidental that Comrade Tian Han's scripts are getting better and better. The success of the performance is not accidental either.

Labor creates beauty, creates art, and creates the world. Under the leadership of the Party, China's 600 million people are creating a happy world with the mighty power of moving mountains and seas. Artists must play their roles well in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. I cheer for "Ode to the Ming Tombs Reservoir" and applaud socialist artistic creation! (Attached picture)

    为“十三陵水库畅想曲”大声喝彩！
    欧阳予倩
    首都人民在总路线的光辉照耀下，以无比的社会主义干劲，超速完成了伟大的、具有全民的和国际意义的十三陵水库工程。诗人、音乐家、画家、电影工作者、戏曲工作者都在作品中有所反映，话剧舞台上岂能没有？感谢田汉同志以三五个不眠或少眠的晚上赶出了这样一个剧本，感谢中国青年艺术剧院的同志们以不到一星期的突击把它搬上了舞台！这次演出不仅发扬了中国话剧的战斗传统，而且有新的表现和成就。
    这个戏是一篇波澜壮阔的史诗，也是一篇抒社会主义热情的抒情诗。作为一个话剧，无论编剧、导演，都打破了陈规，创造了新的形式，运用了新的手法。要把像十三陵水库工程建设者们的英雄形象表现在舞台上，不能不有大刀阔斧的气魄，打破陈规，创造新的形式。十二场戏——回溯过去，歌颂现在，预见将来，都能举重若轻，简练地一气呵成，成为一个整体，真是挥洒自如，可称大手笔。
    戏必须写人与人的关系，忽略了这一点去写劳动过程必然失败。但是，怎样把四十万人的劳动热情，形象地介绍给观众却是一个难题。作者通过一个文化慰劳团贯串全剧，把一些有代表性的典型人物、典型事迹相互交织起来成为一个画卷，成为一套交响乐曲。剧中每一个人物形象都写得真实，介绍彼此的关系也明快而动人。那些劳动英雄们都那么朴素、谦虚而纯洁，干起活来又那么勇敢而坚毅。他们互相合作，互相竞赛，互相挑战，又互相爱护，极为亲切而谐和。尤其是，我们看到集体，也看到个人。看了这个戏，可以理解个人与集体的关系，个人为了一个崇高的目的无保留地投入集体就能发挥伟大的作用。
    剧中写了接受劳动锻炼改造自己的简教授，也写了如黄仲云那样的落后知识分子，还有胡锦堂那样堕落的作家，造成鲜明的对比。现代陈世美秦香莲那段插曲是有意义的，它使戏的进展更跌宕而多姿。
    戏以二十年后的展望作结非常好，不是这样很难结得住。末一场戏充满着诗情画意，充满着希望和信心；在和谐美满之中仍然保持着警惕，并以不断革命的精神大踏步向更幸福的未来迈进。
    这个戏的演出方法很适当。导演表现出了可爱的才能。这样的戏不宜受舞台框子的拘束，但是导演并没有把大部分的戏搬到框子之外；他运用了整个舞台所有的部分。远景和中景近景当场移动的办法十分恰切，不然就会把戏弄得断断续续不能一气呵成。
    接连不断的报喜队从台下几个方面走上台去，很有声势，借此介绍各个组的英雄人物也显得简明而有力。台上布置了劳动场面——挑土、推车、打夯等交织起来，队形、地位和走的线路流走变化，同时也注意到服装颜色的配置，构成生动的舞台画面。满台的人，男男女女、老老少少、工农兵学商各种人物一队队一群群来来往往，一同劳动。打夯的歌好听极了！唱得人兴奋得想跳上台去和他们一同唱一同劳动。这种场面处理不当就很容易闷、容易板、也容易乱；但我们所见的却是色彩鲜明的图画，节奏整然的乐章。看上去花团锦簇，听起来玉振金和。啊，劳动的紧张愉快，劳动的美！有人问：是不是可以把劳动动作更夸张一些、更舞蹈化一些？我认为这究竟不是舞剧，像现在这样适当的加工就很好。如果过于突出舞蹈部分，可能使全剧的风格不易调和。
    末一场写的是距今二十年后的事。这不是幻想，是有根据、有把握的事实，也许估计得还有些保守。那一首长歌处理得很好，曲子也很好。我不大同意“话剧加唱”的说法，因为很容易引起误解。这个戏里的几段唱是必要的，每一首歌都安排得适当，配置得很自然，可以增强戏的效果。响彻云霄的打夯歌就起了振奋人心很大的作用。但这个戏的形式还是话剧。话剧里可以在必要的场合尽量加唱、加音乐，但不必把话剧加唱作为一个固定的形式。在一个戏里如何运用器乐和声乐，这是作家和导演可以自由处理的。
    十三陵水库的四十万英雄以冲天的干劲创造了奇迹，剧作家以冲天的干劲用三五天的工夫写出剧本；导演、演员、音乐家、舞台工作者等也以冲天的干劲不到一星期就把戏搬上舞台。戏是那么好，那么动人，谁敢说赶任务赶不出好东西！主要看你有没有政治热情，有没有革命干劲，有没有艺术修养。这次的演出是多快好省，力争上游的好榜样之一。戏完的时候，听见有人说：“作者真是天才”。毛泽东时代必定会产生许多天才的艺术家；党的培养，革命的锻炼，生产大跃进的鼓舞，群众的启发，个人的虚心学习，力争上游的干劲，这些就是天才的基础；离开这些条件，不可能有天才。在人民当家作主的今天，十三陵水库才能建成；关汉卿也才会得到正确的估价。时势造英雄，田汉同志的剧本越写越好决不是偶然的。演出的成功也不是偶然的。
    劳动创造美，创造艺术，创造世界，中国六亿人民在党的领导之下，正以造海移山的伟力创造幸福世界。艺术家们必定要在社会主义建设的大跃进中演好自己所担任的角色。我为“十三陵水库畅想曲”喝彩，为社会主义的艺术创作欢呼！（附图片）
