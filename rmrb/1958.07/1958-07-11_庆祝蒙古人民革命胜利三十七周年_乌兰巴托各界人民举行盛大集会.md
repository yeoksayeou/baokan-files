Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 10th. People from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar held a meeting at the State Theater this afternoon to celebrate the 37th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11).

After Lamqin , member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and First Secretaiy of the Ulaanbaatar Municipal Committee, who was chairman of the meeting, announced the opening of the meeting, S. Luvsan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, made a report.

S. Luvsan said in his report that the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution was achieved under the influence of the October Revolution and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the basic and decisive task currently facing the people of the whole country is to end the special transitional stage from feudalism to socialism in the next few years.

S. Luvsan said that the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party held at the beginning of this year put forward new tasks for the Mongolian people to build socialism. In response to the call of the Party, herdsmen have established 48 cooperatives in the past three months, and the number of livestock joining the cooperatives has increased by 7%. In some provinces, the number of herding households joining the cooperatives has reached 60% to 70% of the total number of herding households. The problem of organizing scattered individual herdsmen is gradually being solved.

When talking about the achievements of production in the first half of this year, S. Luvsan pointed out that the survival rate of young animals nationwide reached 94.3%; the industrial sector has completed the production plan for the first half of the year; factories and enterprises in Ulaanbaatar alone have saved six million tugriks; many workers have also used waste materials to make new products; and the number of students in school and graduates has also increased. He said that labor training for students will be strengthened in the future.

Then, he talked about the great achievements made by the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries in building socialism. He pointed out that these achievements are in sharp contrast to the economic recession in the capitalist world. He said that the victory of the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries in building socialism is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism.

He said that the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries, united around the basis of Marxism-Leninism, lead the world workers' movement and hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, but modern revisionism betrays the revolutionary ideas of the working class and eulogizes capitalism. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a concentrated expression of modern revisionism. S. Luvsan condemned the Yugoslav revisionists for attempting to split the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp from within. He also exposed the Yugoslav leaders' distortion of the theory of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

S. Luvsan said that Tito slandered the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries in his speech in Labin, especially groundlessly slandering China as "belligerent." S. Luvsan said, is it China and its leaders, who voluntarily withdrew the volunteers from Korea and first advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, who are "belligerent," or is it the American imperialists who continue to keep troops in South Korea, build atomic weapons bases, and interfere in the internal affairs of Indonesia and Lebanon? This is known to the world without Tito's explanation.

S. Luvsan said that the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries have unanimously criticized Yugoslav revisionism. The unity and cooperation of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries have been further consolidated and strengthened. He said that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will unite and cooperate more closely with the fraternal parties of all countries, and use Marxism-Leninism to lead and inspire the people to build socialism.

Mongolian party and government leaders Tsedenbal, Damba, Sambu and others, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia, attended today's celebration. After the celebration, song and dance performances were held.

    庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十七周年
    乌兰巴托各界人民举行盛大集会
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　乌兰巴托市各界人民今天下午在国家剧院举行大会，庆祝蒙古人民革命胜利三十七周年（7月11日）。
    大会主席、蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员兼乌兰巴托市市委第一书记拉木勤宣布开会以后，蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员、中央委员会第二书记苏伦扎布作了报告。
    苏伦扎布在报告中说，蒙古人民革命的胜利是在十月革命的影响以及苏联的无私的帮助下取得的。他指出，目前全国人民面临的一个基本的决定性的任务，就是在最近几年内结束从封建主义过渡到社会主义的特殊的过渡阶段。
    苏伦扎布说，今年初召开的蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会向蒙古人民提出了建设社会主义的新任务。牧民响应党的号召，在最近三个月内已经建立了四十八个合作社，入社牲畜增加了7％。在一些省份中，入社的牧户已经达到牧户总数的60％至70％。把分散的个体的牧民组织起来的问题正在逐步得到解决。
    苏伦扎布在谈到今年上半年生产的成就时指出，全国幼畜成活率达到了94.3％；工业部门已经完成了上半年的生产计划；仅乌兰巴托市的工厂企业就节约了六百万图格里克；许多工人还利用废料制成了新产品；在校学生和毕业学生的人数也增加了。他说，今后将加强学生的劳动锻炼。
    接着，他谈到了苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家在建设社会主义中获得的伟大成就。他指出，这种成就同资本主义世界的经济衰退形成了明显的对比。他说，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家建设社会主义的胜利是马克思列宁主义思想的伟大胜利。
    他说，团结在马克思列宁主义基础周围的各国共产党和工人党领导着世界工人运动，高高地举起了马克思列宁主义的旗帜，但是现代修正主义却背叛工人阶级的革命思想，颂扬资本主义。南共纲领就是现代修正主义的集中表现。苏伦扎布谴责南斯拉夫修正主义者企图从内部分裂社会主义阵营的团结合作。他还揭露南共领导集团歪曲社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论。
    苏伦扎布说，铁托在拉宾发表的演说中谩骂各国共产党和工人党，特别是毫无根据地诽谤中国“好战”。苏伦扎布说，是从朝鲜自动撤出志愿军和首先倡导和平共处五项原则的中国和它的领袖们“好战”呢，还是把军队继续留在南朝鲜、建立原子武器基地、干涉印度尼西亚和黎巴嫩内政的美帝国主义好战呢？这是不需要铁托解释而举世皆知的。
    苏伦扎布说，各国共产党和工人党团结一致地批判南斯拉夫修正主义。各国共产党和工人党的团结合作更加巩固和加强了。他说，蒙古人民革命党将同各国兄弟党更加紧密地团结合作，并且以马克思列宁主义来领导和鼓舞人民建设社会主义。
    出席今天庆祝会的有蒙古党政领导人泽登巴尔、达姆巴、桑布等和各国驻蒙古的外交使节。在庆祝会结束以后举行了歌舞表演。
