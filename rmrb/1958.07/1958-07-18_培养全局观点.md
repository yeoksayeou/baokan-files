Cultivating a Global Perspective
Ji Shi

The mutual cultivation of experimental fields by the Changchun City Department Store and the Jiamei Can Factory is a good initiative arising from the rectification movement, relying on the masses, and improving mutual relations in the spirit of communism between industrial and commercial departments. Through this method, the relationship between the industrial and commercial sectors can be as close as family members, and it can bear fruitful results in developing production and meeting the needs of the people.

Originally, developing production and meeting the needs of the people are the common tasks of both industry and commerce. However, due to the different positions of the two sides and the different angles from which they consider issues, some contradictions are inevitable. The contradictions between industrial and commercial departments in our country are contradictions where fundamental interests are aligned. There are two ways to resolve such contradictions: one is to simply rely on superiors to resolve them; the other is to rely on the masses, promote the spirit of communism, and actively cooperate with each other. The Changchun City Department Store and the Jiamei Can Factory, through the mutual cultivation of experimental fields, allow leading cadres, workers, and shop assistants to meet directly, and producers to meet consumers, enabling cadres, workers, and shop assistants to receive profound education in labor practice and further understand each other's situations and existing problems. This effectively overcomes the departmentalism of only starting from a local perspective, enhances the overall perspective, the production perspective, and the mass perspective, laying an ideological foundation for resolving industrial and commercial contradictions.

Mutual cultivation of experimental fields by commercial and industrial departments, like other experimental fields, can help employees become both red and expert. But there are also differences: using this method, cadres can not only familiarize themselves with the business knowledge of their own departments but also familiarize themselves with the business knowledge of relevant aspects, achieving both proficiency in commerce and industry. This is of great significance for improving and refining work. This method can not only be widely promoted in industrial and commercial departments but also in other departments (such as between hospitals and pharmacies). In this way, the overall perspective can be strengthened, the collaborative relationship between departments can be significantly improved, and a new situation of mutual learning, mutual assistance, and joint leap forward will emerge.

    培养全局观点
    吉示
    长春市百货公司同嘉美制罐厂互种试验田，是工业和商业部门在整风运动基础上，依靠群众，按照共产主义精神改善相互关系的良好创举。通过这种办法，可以使工业和商业两个部门的关系亲如家人，并且在发展生产和满足人民需要方面结出丰硕的果实。
    本来，发展生产，满足人民需要，是工商双方共同的任务。但是由于双方所处的岗位不同，考虑问题的角度有所不同，因此不免会发生一些矛盾。我国工业部门和商业部门之间的矛盾，是根本利益一致的矛盾。解决这种矛盾的办法有两种：一种是单纯依靠上级来解决；另一种是依靠群众，发扬共产主义精神，彼此主动地互相协作。长春市百货公司和嘉美制罐厂通过互种试验田，使领导干部、工人、店员直接见面，使生产者同消费者见面，使干部、工人、店员在劳动实践中受到深刻的教育，进一步了解到互相之间的情况和存在的问题。这就有效地克服了只从局部出发的本位主义思想，增强了全局观点、生产观点和群众观点，为解决工商矛盾打下思想基础。
    商业和工业部门互种试验田，也同其他试验田一样，可以使职工达到又红又专。但也有不同的地方：采取这种方法，不仅可以使干部熟悉本部门的业务知识，而且可以熟悉有关方面的业务知识，做到既通商，又通工。这对提高和改进工作具有很大的意义。这种方法不仅可以在工商部门广泛推广，而且可以在其他部门推广（如医院同医药商店之间）。这样，可以加强全局观点，使各部门之间的协作关系显著改进，出现一个互相学习，互相帮助，共同跃进的新局面。
