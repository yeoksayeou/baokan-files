    This Double Act Was Really Well Performed
    ——A Record of the Debate at Beijing Normal University on Revising the Classical Literature Teaching Syllabus
    By Our Correspondent Wei Wenhua
    Recently, in the Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group of the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Beijing Normal University, students and teachers engaged in a heated debate over the compilation of a classical literature teaching syllabus during the teaching reform. In this debate, young students held high the red flag, bravely challenged the old traditions, pulled out the white flag from the classical literature front, and hoisted a bright red banner.
    In the past, the old professors always cordoned off the subject of classical literature, deliberately making it seem unfathomable, using the mystery of the ancients to peddle bourgeois ideas. This June, when the school launched a teaching reform movement, this group of teachers, after rectification and the "Double-Anti" movement, also began to revise the teaching syllabus. However, because their position and viewpoint had not been completely changed, they were merely patching up and changing the appearance without changing the substance; some even clung to the old and refused to seriously consider revising, simply copying the old text onto new paper to get by. This approach aroused dissatisfaction among students. Some students in the third and fourth grades of the Chinese Department dispelled their blind faith in bourgeois experts and decided to start from scratch, learning by doing, and compiling a new syllabus themselves as a memorial to their alma mater and as a gift to the Party.
    This suggestion received the attention and support of the Party. Under the direct leadership of the Party General Branch of the department, a "Chinese Classical Literature Reform Group" was established. At this time, some old professors ridiculed, saying, "You can't write a syllabus on an empty stomach. How much material do you have in your belly?" Some even quizzed students, "What are the four divine objects? Do you know the four legends?" They wanted to scare the students back with these difficult questions. But the students did not back down. They accepted the challenge of the old professors. With the support of four Party member teachers in the teaching and research group, they began new work.
    They first spent two days studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's literary and artistic policies. Then, according to the stages of Chinese classical literature, they divided the thirty-five people into eight combat groups, concentrated their efforts to break through the weak links that were ridiculed by some teachers, and went to the school and relevant libraries in Beijing, folk literature research institutions, and other places to find materials and copy materials. They took realistic folk literature as the main body, and collected a large number of folk songs, including chrysanthemum poems written by Huang Chao, the leader of the peasant uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty, which are still circulating among the people in Hubei, and poems and lyrics praising the Loyal King during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. In four or five days, twenty-six fourth-year students read a total of 291 books, some of which even the old professors had not read. By the time the first draft of the teaching syllabus was written on June 29, it was found that the section on Yuan Dynasty literature was not satisfactory. Therefore, they divided up the work to read relevant literary history materials, Yuan Dynasty dramas, etc. After discussion, three people were assigned to write the draft, and it was rewritten overnight. After seven days of hard work, a new classical literature teaching syllabus was completed.
    At this time, the leaders of the department printed and distributed the two teaching syllabuses compiled by the teachers and students of the teaching and research group, respectively, for discussion by students in the seventeen classes of all four grades of the department. The preliminary discussion showed that the students believed that although the teachers' syllabus had some improvements compared with the old syllabus, it still regarded the literature of the feudal ruling class as orthodox because it had not jumped out of the old circle. In contrast, although the teaching syllabus compiled by the students had some shortcomings, it was fundamentally a completely new syllabus. It ran through the spirit of taking politics as the soul and emphasizing the present over the past, put forward the opposition between the two cultures of the exploiting class and the exploited class in each historical period from the viewpoint of historical materialism, took realism as the main line, regarded people's literature as orthodox, and made folk literature an uninterrupted system from the pre-Qin period to the end of the Qing Dynasty, so that the creations of the working people, which had been buried for a long time, were re-illuminated. There were bold reversals of verdicts here. It found out the anti-realist context of the classical writers Wang Wei, Li Houzhu, Zhou Bangyan, Liu Yong, and Li Qingzhao, who had always been highly praised by the old literary history, and re-evaluated Tao Yuanming, Su Dongpo, and others appropriately. Huang Chao, the revolutionary leader who had been neglected by the old literary history, and Bai Juyi and Lu You, patriotic poets who reflected the suffering of the people, occupied important positions in the new syllabus. Some old professors strongly disagreed.
    A great debate began. First in the teaching and research group, then in various classes and in the department-wide conference, a total of twenty-three discussions and nine face-to-face debates were held. In the discussion, everyone put forward many opinions to help students improve the syllabus, but some old professors nitpicked in the students' syllabus, and some even criticized the new syllabus for not analyzing Guan Yu in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", not analyzing Wu Song in "Water Margin", and not analyzing Hou Fangyu in "The Peach Blossom Fan". They said that this was because students were afraid of difficulties and dared not analyze these people. Some people proposed that based on his "impression", the Song Dynasty lyricist Liu Yong was so and so remarkable. The Party General Branch organized the students to read all 190 lyrics in Liu Yong's "Lezhang Collection" overnight and analyze them. According to the study of Liu Yong's lyrics, which contained decadent content and described the decadent life of "fireworks and alleys", it was pointed out that Liu Yong was an anti-realist lyricist.
    At a group meeting to debate Han Dynasty literature, Shao Wu, a third-year student, pointed out that the teacher's syllabus put the cart before the horse, focusing on court literature and Han fu, while downplaying the folk songs of the Music Bureau, which reflected the voices of the people at that time, and did not even have a separate section. He proposed, "We must fight for the status of folk songs of the Music Bureau!" Xu Zhenzong, a student of the second class of the second grade of the Chinese Department, said at the department-wide conference on behalf of the whole class, pointing out the distortion of historical figures in the teacher's syllabus. He said: "For example, Du Fu's achievement was that he was close to the people at that time and reflected the people's thoughts and feelings, but the teacher said that he was influenced by Confucianism and humanitarianism. Our whole class disagreed with the teacher's distortion of history in this way." Some teachers did have Marxist-Leninist phrases in the teaching syllabus they compiled, such as one professor who said that he had accepted the opinions of the students when he compiled the syllabus of Song Ci, but he did not deceive the students. Sun Yizhen, a fourth-year female student, pointed out on the spot that the part of the Song Ci in the teaching syllabus of that professor was still peddling bourgeois ideas. She cited the works of the Song Dynasty female lyricist Li Qingzhao, who was praised by the professor in the syllabus as having a sense of life. When she read the so-called "searching and searching, desolate and desolate, miserable and miserable" in a lyric of "Slow Sound", she immediately asked the professor: "Teacher! What is this so-called sense of life? This is a noble lady who has nothing to do after eating her fill, venting her decadent emotions of decline. We have been poisoned a lot in the past when we studied Ci, and these things are not allowed in the socialist classroom today!"
    All the teachers and students of the department were involved in this debate. Dozens of people spoke at large and small meetings, and discussions were also held in each class. This was a serious struggle, a principled dispute over teaching ideology, teaching methods, and academic attitudes. After a thorough debate, both teachers and students attended a vivid socialist lesson. Lecturer Shen Zaoxiang said at the last grand debate on the 15th: "This double act was really well performed. Our teachers screwed up the performance, because what we sang were still old words. We now feel that we must, under the leadership of the Party, accelerate the transformation of ourselves, arm our minds with Marxism-Leninism, and work together with the students to teach this course well!"
    After discussion by the whole department, the syllabus compiled by the Party General Branch and a group of teachers leading the students was taken as the basis, and the opinions of the teachers were absorbed and modified, and it was used as the official teaching syllabus of the teaching and research group. Now the people in this teaching and research group are full of vitality and have proposed a three-in-one method of the Party Committee, teachers, and students to further criticize bourgeois pseudo-science, vigorously explore the ancient folk literature that has been suppressed and buried, let people's literature ascend to the throne of literary history, and improve the quality of classical literature teaching to the communist level in the shortest possible time.

    这场对台戏唱得真好
    ——记北京师范大学修改古典文学教学大纲的一场论战
    本报记者　魏文华
    这些天来，北京师范大学中国语言文学系古典文学教研组，在教学改革中，学生和教师为编制古典文学教学大纲而进行了一场热烈的辩论。在这场辩论中，青年学生高举红旗，勇敢地向旧传统挑战，拔掉古典文学阵地上的白旗，插起一面鲜红的旗帜。
    老教授们，过去一直把古典文学这门学科圈为禁地，故意讲得高深莫测，利用古人的神秘来贩卖资产阶级思想。今年6月间学校开展教学改革运动，这一部分教师经过整风、双反运动，也着手修改了教学大纲。但由于立场观点未彻底改变，修修补补，改头换面，实质不变；个别的甚至抱残守缺，根本就没有认真地考虑修改，只把旧文抄在新纸上交差。这种做法，引起了学生不满，中文系三、四年级部分学生，破除了对资产阶级专家的迷信，决定白手起家，边干边学，自己动手编写一份新的大纲，作为对母校的纪念，也作为向党献礼。
    这个意见，得到党的重视和支持，在系党总支直接领导下，成立“中国古典文学改革小组”。这时一些老教授们嘲笑说：“写大纲不能架空呀，你们肚里有多少材料？”有人甚至考问学生：“四大神物是什么？你知道四大传奇吗？”想用这些难题把学生吓回去。但学生们并未退缩，他们接受了老教授的挑战。在教研组四位党员教师的支持下，开始了新的工作。
    他们首先用两天时间学习毛主席著作、党的文艺政策，又按照中国古典文学的阶段，把三十五个人分为八个战斗组，集中力量攻破被有些教师所嘲笑的薄弱环节，分头到学校和北京市有关的图书馆、民间文学研究机构等处找材料，抄材料，以现实主义的民间文学作主体，收集大量民歌，有唐末农民起义领袖黄巢所作、至今仍在湖北民间流传的菊花诗，有太平天国时代农民歌颂忠王的诗词。在四、五天中，四年级的二十六个人共看了二百九十一册书，有些书连老教授也未看过。到6月29日教学大纲初稿写成时，发现元朝文学这一部分不够满意，于是又分工看有关文学史材料、元人杂剧等，经过讨论，由三个人执笔起草，一夜之间重新赶写出来。经过苦战七天，完成了新的古典文学教学大纲。
    这时，系的领导上把教研组教师和学生分别编写的两份教学大纲，印发出来，让全系四个年级十七个班的同学讨论，初步讨论的情况是：同学们认为教师的大纲虽比过去的旧大纲有某些改进，但由于未跳出旧圈子，仍以封建统治阶级文学为正宗。与此相反，学生编写的教学大纲尽管有某些缺点，但根本上它是一份面目全新的大纲，它贯穿着政治做灵魂、厚今薄古的精神，以历史唯物主义的观点提出了每一个历史时期剥削阶级和被剥削阶级两种文化的对立，以现实主义为主线，把人民文学作为正宗，从先秦到清末，民间文学成为一个不间断的系统，使长期被埋没的劳动人民的创造重放光辉。这里有大胆的翻案文章，找出了一直被旧文学史捧得高高的古典作家王维、李后主、周邦彦、柳永、李清照等反现实主义的脉络，对陶渊明、苏东坡等人重新作了适当的估价，那些被旧文学史一直冷视的革命领袖黄巢和反映人民疾苦的白居易、爱国诗人陆游等，都在新大纲中占了重要地位。有些老教授坚决不同意。
    一场大辩论便开始了。先在教研组，后来又在各班以及全系大会上，总共作了二十三次讨论和九次面对面的争辩。在讨论中，大家提出了不少意见，帮助学生改进大纲，但有的老教授在学生大纲中挑字眼，有人还从新大纲中挑剔三国演义没有分析关羽、水浒没有分析武松、桃花扇中没有分析侯方域。说这是学生畏难不敢分析这些人。有人提出凭他的“印象”，说宋朝词人柳永如何如何了不起。党总支便组织学生用一夜的时间把柳永“乐章集”一百九十多首词全部读完，并进行分析。根据研究柳永词内容颓废以及描写“烟花巷陌”的腐朽生活等，指出柳永是一个反现实主义的词人。
    在一次小组会上，辩论汉代文学，三年级学生绍武，指出教师大纲中本末倒置，大讲宫廷文学汉赋，而对反映当时人民呼声的乐府民歌轻描淡写，连单独一节的地位都没有，提出“我们要为乐府民歌争地位！”中文系二年级第二班学生徐振宗代表全班同学在全系大会上发言时，指出教师大纲对历史人物的歪曲，他说：“例如杜甫的成就是他当时接近了人民，反映了人民的思想感情，而老师说他是受了儒家思想和人道主义的影响。我们全班同学都不同意教师这样来歪曲历史。”有的教师在编写的教学大纲中，确实也有马列主义词句，如有一位教授说他编宋词的大纲时已接受了同学的意见，但是没有蒙住学生的眼睛。四年级女学生孙一珍当场指出那位教授教学大纲中宋词的那一部分，仍在贩卖资产阶级思想，她举出被教授在大纲中推崇为有生活气息的宋朝女词人李清照的作品，当她读到“声声慢”一首词里的所谓“寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”，随即问教授：“老师！这算什么生活气息？这是一个贵妇人吃饱了没事干，发泄她那没落的颓废的感情。我们过去学词，已受了不少的毒，今天社会主义课堂上不允许再有这些东西！”
    全系的教师、学生都卷进了这一场论战，大小会议上发言的有几十人，另外在每一个班级也作了讨论。这是一场严肃的斗争，是教学思想、教学方法、治学态度的原则争论。经过彻底的辩论，教师和学生都上了一堂生动的社会主义课。讲师沈藻翔在15日最后一次大辩论会上发言时说：“这场对台戏唱得很好，我们老师是唱砸（拆台）了，因为我们唱的还是老词儿。我们现在才感到，一定要在党的领导下，加速改造自己，用马列主义武装头脑，和学生群策群力，共同把这一门课教好！”
    经过全系讨论，以党总支和一部分教师领导学生编写的大纲为基础，吸收教师意见加以修改，作为教研组正式的教学大纲。现在这个教研组的人，朝气勃勃，又提出党委、教师、学生三结合的办法，进一步批评资产阶级伪科学，大力发掘被压抑被埋没了的古代民间文学，让人民文学登上文学史的宝座，在最短的时期内，把古典文学教学质量提高到共产主义水平。
