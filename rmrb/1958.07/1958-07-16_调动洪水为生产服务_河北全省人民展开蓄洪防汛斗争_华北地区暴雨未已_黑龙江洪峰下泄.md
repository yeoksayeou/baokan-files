(By our Tianjin Correspondent, 15th) The achievements of the people of Hebei Province in large-scale water conservancy construction since last winter and this spring have demonstrated a tremendous role in this water storage and flood prevention effort. Currently, the people of the entire province have shifted from an intense drought prevention struggle to an intense flood prevention struggle to protect the autumn harvest.

Since July 10th, various places have continuously experienced heavy rains and torrential downpours, with the center of the rainstorms concentrated in the upper reaches of the Jiyun, Chaobai, Beiyun, Yongding, and Daqing Rivers. Each river has seen flood peaks exceeding one thousand cubic meters per second. The people of the entire province have resolutely implemented the flood prevention policy of "focusing on storage, storage for utilization, and mobilizing floodwaters for production services." Many places have managed to control the floodwaters, dispersing the water's force and eliminating the threat of flooding. The water storage capacity of the medium and small reservoirs built on the twenty-five small rivers in Baoding Prefecture that have already been harnessed reaches a total of 100 million cubic meters, significantly reducing runoff. In Xuishui County, due to the construction of various projects and widespread water storage, even though rainfall reached 120 millimeters this year, no rainwater was lost and was all retained in the mountains. On July 13, 1954, 105 millimeters of rain fell in the upper reaches of the Caohe River, causing a disaster downstream. This year, the Caohe station recorded a flood peak of 131 cubic meters per second, with rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters, but no flooding was seen in the river channel. Various localities also diverted floodwaters for siltation and irrigation. Statistics from Ding County, Qingyuan County, and Tang County in Baoding Prefecture show that over 750 cadres and more than 10,000 people braved the rain to divert floodwaters for siltation and irrigation. After more than two days of hard work, they had rushed to silt and irrigate 335,000 mu of land, generally releasing floodwaters one Chinese foot or more deep, with silt deposits reaching five fen to one cun. This dispersed over 75 million cubic meters of floodwater and deposited over 4.4 million cubic meters of silt, equivalent to 17 billion jin of fertilizer. Therefore, the masses are very pleased. The masses said: "In the past, we feared water, now we desire water. In the old society, water brought disaster, in the new society, water brings blessings."

Currently, rainfall is still continuing in various places, and the flood prevention struggle is still ongoing. Tangshan Prefecture has mobilized more than 200,000 laborers to participate in flood prevention. Cadres from all localities have been fully mobilized. For the victory of the flood prevention struggle, Hebei Province held a telephone conference tonight, calling on all localities to strengthen flood prevention efforts. Vice Governor Gao Shuxun spoke, requesting all localities to overcome floods, protect the bumper harvest, and do the following things well: ① Fully utilize all flood storage projects, vigorously block floods, disperse the water's force, and reduce the burden on downstream areas. ② Strengthen the defense of river embankments and dikes, and resolutely ensure that there are no breaches. ③ Strengthen the management and utilization of engineering projects, and fully utilize the effectiveness of the projects. ④ Strengthen engineering observation work. ⑤ Accelerate the construction speed of water conservancy projects. At tonight's telephone conference, all localities expressed their determination to overcome floods and ensure an autumn harvest. Hebei farmers expressed their determination to overcome floods, saying: "Rather shed a thousand drops of blood than allow a leak to occur, resolutely block the floodwaters, and protect the agricultural harvest."

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. From the 10th of this month to 8:00 PM on the 15th, North China has experienced six days of rain. The main rainfall area is distributed within Hebei Province. In the northeastern part of Hebei Province, up to 8:00 PM on the 15th, the Luanhe and Chaobai River basins received 200 to 300 millimeters of rainfall, with the maximum exceeding 300 millimeters. The southern area received about 150 millimeters of rainfall. Due to the continuous torrential rains in the eastern region, the river water has risen sharply. Miyun County, upstream of the Chaobai River, and nearby villages were surrounded by water. Yesterday afternoon and evening, the Beijing leadership organs and the leadership departments of the garrison troops quickly dispatched troops and amphibious vehicles, and carrying rubber boats and life-saving equipment, rushed to Miyun County overnight to rescue the trapped masses. By about 7:00 AM this morning, all of the thousand or so people trapped near the county seat had been rescued, and efforts are now underway to rescue the villages further south of the city that are surrounded by water.

The area near Jinan, Shandong, received 150 to 250 millimeters of rainfall. It is estimated that rainfall in Hebei will decrease from the 16th, but cloudy weather may persist for three to four days.

Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western Inner Mongolia will continue to experience rain within four days. In areas with heavy rainfall, dryland fields should pay attention to drainage, flood prevention, and flood storage. Crops that have been flattened by heavy rain should be propped up, and the soil should be cultivated and loosened within a few days after the weather clears to facilitate crop growth.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The Heilongjiang River has risen sharply. In the Mohe and Heihe regions along the river, the river water has overflowed its banks, and some riverside towns have been flooded. Relevant departments of Heilongjiang Province are leading the local people in flood prevention and rescue efforts. The Soviet Union has also sent ships to strongly support the rescue work.

Since the 7th of this month, the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River have experienced continuous torrential rains. In Mohe Town, Heilongjiang Province, China, along the river, the river water rose sharply by more than seven meters in three days, exceeding the local water level during the Heilongjiang flood in 1956. By the 10th, the water depth in the streets of Mohe Town reached one to two meters.

In the face of the rapidly rising river water, the Soviet side immediately sent five ships and several Chinese riverboats to jointly rescue the people surrounded by floods in Mohe and other places, ultimately rescuing more than 500 people from the flooded towns and villages in this area. They expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the brotherly support from the Soviet Union.

Currently, the flood peak is discharging downstream along the river. The leading organs of Heilongjiang Province have made emergency deployments, and all localities along the river below Mohe are preparing to face the flood.

    调动洪水为生产服务
    河北全省人民展开蓄洪防汛斗争
    华北地区暴雨未已　黑龙江洪峰下泄
    本报天津15日电　河北全省人民去冬今春以来大搞水利建设的成就，已在这次蓄水防洪中，显示出巨大作用。目前全省人民，已由紧张的防旱斗争，转入紧张的防汛斗争，以保卫秋季大丰收。
    从7月10日以来，各地都连续地下了大雨和暴雨，暴雨的中心集中在蓟运、潮白、北运、永定、大清等河上游，各河都出现了千秒公方以上的洪峰。全省人民坚决执行了“以蓄为主，蓄而为用，调动洪水为生产服务”的防汛方针，许多地方已把洪水管理起来，分散了水势，免除了水患。保定专区在已经根治的二十五条小河上建成的中、小型水库的蓄水总量达一亿公方，径流显著减少。徐水县暴河、漕河，都由于修了各种工程，处处蓄水，今年降雨量虽然达到了一百二十公厘，但雨水全没走掉，被留在山上了。1954年7月13日漕河上游落了一百零五公厘，下游成灾。今年漕河站曾出现一百三十一秒公方的洪峰，落雨一百公厘以上，河道里仍未见有洪水。各地并引洪淤灌。保定专区定县、清苑、唐县等地统计，有七百五十多名干部，一万多名群众，冒雨引洪淤灌，经两天多奋战，已抢洪淤灌三十三万五千亩，一般的都放洪水一市尺以上，淤泥达五分到一寸。已分散洪水七千五百多万公方，淤泥四百四十多万公方，相当于一百七十亿斤肥料。因此群众非常欢迎。群众说：“过去怕水，现在想水，旧社会水闯祸，新社会水造福。”
    目前，各地仍在继续降雨，防汛斗争仍在继续进行。唐山专区动员了二十多万民工投入防汛。各地干部全部出动。为了防汛斗争的胜利，今天晚上河北省召开电话会议，号召各地加强防汛斗争。副省长高树勋讲话，要求各地战胜洪水，保卫大丰收，并做好以下的几件事情：①充分利用一切蓄洪工程，大力拦阻洪水，分散水势，减轻下游负担。②加强河道堤防防守，坚决保证不决口。③加强工程管理运用，充分发挥工程效能。④加强工程观测工作。⑤加速水利工程施工速度。在今晚的电话会议上，各地均表现了战胜洪水确保秋季丰收的决心。河北农民表示战胜洪水的决心时说：“宁流千滴血，不让出漏洞，坚决堵住洪水，保卫农业丰收。”
    新华社15日讯　华北地区从本月10日起到15日晚八时止，已下了六天雨。主要降雨区分布在河北境内，河北东北部地区到15日八时止，滦河与潮白河流域降雨二百到三百公厘，最大达三百公厘以上。南部地区降一百五十公厘左右。由于东部地区连日暴雨，河水陡涨。潮白河上游密云县城及附近村庄被水包围，昨日午后及夜间，北京市领导机关和驻军领导部门迅速派出部队及水陆两用汽车，并携带橡皮舟、救生用具，连夜赶赴密云县城抢救被围群众，至今晨七时许，县城附近被围的千余群众全部抢救脱险，现正在抢救城南较远的被水包围的村庄。
    山东济南附近降一五○到二五○公厘。估计从16日起，河北降雨可望减少，但阴天仍可维持三天到四天。
    山西、陕西和内蒙古西部在四天以内将继续有雨。各地多雨地区的旱作田地，应注意排水、防涝及蓄洪工作，因暴雨倒伏的作物要设法扶起，天晴以后数日内应进行中耕松土，以利作物生长。
    新华社15日讯　黑龙江水陡涨，沿江漠河地区和黑河地区江水漫岸，江边部分乡镇进水，黑龙江省有关部门正领导当地人民防汛和抢救；苏联方面也派出船只大力支援了抢救的工作。
    本月7日以来，黑龙江上游连降暴雨。沿江我国黑龙江省漠河镇，三天内江水陡涨了七公尺多，超出了1956年黑龙江发生洪水的当地水位。到10日，漠河镇街内水深达一公尺到二公尺。
    在江水陡涨的情况下，江对岸苏联方面立即派出五艘船只和我国的数艘江轮共同对被洪水包围的漠河等地群众进行了抢救，终使这一带被淹村镇的五百多人脱险。他们对苏联的兄弟般的支援表示衷心的感谢。
    目前，洪峰正沿江下泄。黑龙江省领导机关已经做了紧急部署，漠河以下沿江各地正准备迎战洪水。
