How Our Own Cars Are Made
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yin Chongjing

In late May of this year, almost all newspapers across the country published a photo: Chairman Mao smiling as he rode in the "Dongfeng." That was on the afternoon of May 21st, when our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong rode in the first domestically produced small car, the "Dongfeng," successfully trial-manufactured by the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, slowly driving around the back garden of Huairentang twice. After Chairman Mao got out of the car, he gave a gratified smile to the representatives of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China gathered around, saying, "I've ridden in a small car made by ourselves!"

Now, only two months after Chairman Mao said those words, "small cars made by ourselves" are not just the "Dongfeng" alone. The "Advanced" of Chongqing, the "Jinggangshan" of Beijing, and the "Peace" of Tianjin have also appeared, jumping to a total of four types. Since the beginning of this year, including small cars, seventeen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have successfully trial-manufactured fifty types of automobiles. Their varieties are quite complete, including light and medium-sized trucks, three-wheeled trucks, automatic loading and unloading vehicles, multi-purpose agricultural vehicles, city sprinkler trucks, large buses, small cars, jeeps, and even a miniature car that two people can lift. Our automobile manufacturing industry is still just a two-year-old child, but in the short few months of this year, it has grown to the stage of taking flight.

But how exactly are these many "cars made by ourselves" manufactured? Now, an opportunity has arisen to answer this question from multiple perspectives.

In the second half of July, the Sixth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a technical innovation experience exchange conference in Tianjin. Skilled craftsmen from all over the country who personally manufactured cars, as well as factory leaders, gathered together. They also brought the cars they made and many technical innovation exhibits, holding a rich and colorful exhibition.

		Skilled Craftsmen Display Amazing Artistry

At the very front of the square outside the exhibition hall entrance, the "Jinggangshan" and "Peace" brand new streamlined small cars were displayed first. This pair of sister cars, born within a week of each other (June 20th and 25th), immediately attracted the attention of the audience. One was wrapped in a pure white gown, the other was dressed in light colors with an egg-blue upper part and a sky-blue lower part; one had the layered peaks of "Jinggangshan" inlaid on its forehead, and the other had a "Peace" dove ready to fly on the front of the car. Their appearance and lines gave people a beautiful impression at first glance.

Comrades from the Beijing factory and the Tianjin factory introduced various situations to me. It turned out that one of these factories was an automobile parts factory, and the other was an automobile repair factory. During the upsurge of great leaps in production and ideological liberation this year, the workers put forward the request to produce automobiles, transforming their factories from repair to manufacturing, from "parts" to "complete vehicles." However, producing automobiles was not an easy task after all, and the manufacturing of small cars was even more difficult. For example, there were more than a thousand parts that needed to be stamped, such as car covers, doors, steel rims, and wheel drums. They had neither blueprints nor molds. What to do? The workers in the Beijing factory put forward a bold slogan: "Overcome difficulties with the momentum of the Huaihai Campaign, the resourcefulness of seizing Mount Hua, and the fighting spirit of Shangganling!" The designers first used plasticine to create a model of a car according to the unique style imagined by the factory, and then gave it to everyone for evaluation and modification. More than twenty of Beijing's most skilled sheet metal workers came to participate in this glorious work. They used their skilled hands to hammer out those parts with quite high technical requirements, one hammer blow at a time. After polishing or painting, no one could recognize that they were actually handmade products.

The particularly exquisite decoration equipment is another characteristic of small cars. Professors and students from Tsinghua University and the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, and capable goldsmiths from Tianjin participated in the artistic design of "Jinggangshan" and "Peace." More than forty factories in Beijing, Tianjin, and major cities across the country produced more than two hundred and seventy kinds of cooperative parts for them, such as instruments, electrical appliances, radios, paint, glass, rubber, and cushions. Therefore, the workers said: Our small cars are the product of communist cooperation.

		Consulting with Farmers and Starting from the Countryside

Next to the "Jinggangshan" and "Peace" on display was a "Luoyang" brand multi-purpose agricultural vehicle, which was manufactured by the Luoyang Automobile Repair and Assembly Plant, which people call "having a factory director, workers, but no factory building." People who know the situation all believe that producing such a good car in such a factory is simply an unprecedented myth at home and abroad. At that time, the entire factory had only one hundred and twenty-odd people, without a single engineer or technician, and the only five ordinary machine tools were old and broken, but they dared to think and dared to do, and were determined to manufacture cars. What did they rely on? The factory director told me that they relied on one incomparably superior condition: having a group of old and skilled repair workers. These workers had all personally repaired more than ten brands of cars, and some had even worked as car drivers for more than ten years. They were the most intelligent.

The production process of the "Luoyang" brand car was very unique. Its design was not carried out in the office, but by a trial-manufacture technical research group composed of workers who went to the countryside to conduct investigations and consult with farmers. Based on the characteristics of narrow rural roads, they designed the car body to be about the same width and length as a horse-drawn cart. It could go anywhere a horse-drawn cart could go. Also, based on the needs of multiple uses in rural areas, they installed a power output shaft under the car. When the car is not driving, it can be used to drive machines for grinding flour, pumping water, pressing oil, and ginning cotton, and it can also generate electricity. That is to say, it is both a car and a mobile power station.

When manufacturing this car, the thatched houses, whose eaves were about the same height as the car body and could not be considered factory buildings, could not be used at all. The forging workers set up canvas sheds in the open field to work, and the sand casting workers dug a pit in the ground and built a furnace with a few refractory bricks. Due to the extreme lack of equipment, except for a few parts such as the engine, everything was hammered out by the workers with thousands of blows by hand. The workers innovated technically while hammering, creating and improving sixty-four kinds of tools, which gradually improved production efficiency.

		Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Relying on Self-Reliance

Comrades from the Nanjing Automobile Repair Plant (now upgraded to an automobile manufacturing plant) told me a story: This year's Spring Festival was the wedding day that Han Yucheng, the director of the stamping workshop, had long chosen. On New Year's Eve, all the relatives and friends who came to congratulate him had arrived, and the bride was also dressed up, just waiting for the wedding ceremony to begin, but the groom was nowhere to be seen. No matter how long they waited, he didn't arrive. He didn't arrive until after midnight. It turned out that he hadn't left work that night, staying in the workshop to participate in the final battle to rush-produce the "Leap Forward" brand car beams.

Pressing the beams is an important key to manufacturing cars. The Nanjing factory made bold creations in this regard, combining indigenous and foreign methods to solve difficulties relying on self-reliance, making outstanding contributions. According to modern standardized production, a huge press is needed. The Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant uses a 3,500-ton press. This machine is three stories high, and each of the four fastening screws alone weighs twenty-five tons. And what about the Nanjing factory's equipment parts? There was a press with a pressure of only 220 tons, less than one-fifteenth of the Changchun factory's. It could not be used. Furthermore, ordering a set of standardized molds for pressing beams would take more than a year, requiring dozens of tons of cast steel and a cost of 60,000 yuan. This was another impossible and urgent matter. Therefore, the Nanjing factory sent people to visit and learn from various places, seeking inspiration, and also held more than ten "three-way combination" meetings with veteran workers, engineering and technical personnel, and leading cadres. A solution combining indigenous and foreign methods was finally devised: make full use of the small 220-ton press, use a steel plate welded structure instead of cast steel parts to manufacture simple indigenous molds, and exceptionally press the beams in three sections. This invention of combining indigenous and foreign methods to press beams was finally successful on the night of the Spring Festival this year.

		Five Thousand Four Hundred and Forty-Seven Parts

The birth of a pair of "Red Flag" brand off-road vehicles in Wuhan is another extraordinary event.

When the Wuhan Automobile Repair Plant was trial-manufacturing, it did not have a blueprint. Instead, it borrowed a station wagon from the Protocol Department, disassembled it completely into five thousand four hundred and forty-seven parts, numbered each one, and took photos of each one for the workers to carefully refer to and also make two sets themselves. It sounds easy, but it's difficult to do. It was possible to make general parts with reference, but it was not possible to make many parts with complex internal structures that could not be seen clearly with the eyes. They had to be cut open and dissected. However, how could borrowed items be dissected casually? There was no other way but to rely on the wisdom and experience of veteran workers. The most complex part was the cylinder, which people call the "heart" of the car. Indeed, its complexity is no less than that of the human heart. Within that foot-long cylinder block and its thin cylinder walls, there are thirty-three oil passages, water passages, smoke passages, and mounting holes for motors, bearings, and eccentric shafts. The workers demonstrated great ability and a high degree of perseverance when making this car "heart." After the first cylinder block was cast, it was found to have sand holes and leaked water. Also, because it was impossible to see and accurately position the sand mold, the inside and outside did not align, and it had to be recast for the second time, which still failed. It was not successfully made until three days before the car was released. All the workers who participated in the trial production fought for forty-three days, many sleepless nights after sleepless nights, one week of hard work after another, and finally, on June 28th, a pair of precious gifts were manufactured to celebrate the birthday of the Party. Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally named them "Red Flag," encouraging the factory workers to plant this victorious "Red Flag" throughout the province in the shortest possible time.

In other regions, such as Qijiang, Shenyang, Shanghai, Jinan, Harbin, Fuzhou, Baotou, Hefei, Guiyang... workers at automobile repair plants or automobile parts factories in various places have made their own cars with all their efforts. Now, my country's automobile manufacturing industry is truly flourishing and full of beauty. Many factories have already or are preparing to put their trial-manufactured samples into mass production. Factories have successively proposed to produce dozens, hundreds, or even a thousand cars this year. The national plan, including the "Liberation" brand, is 20,000 vehicles. Dear readers, on the 9th anniversary of National Day this year, you will see the magnificent ranks of "cars made by ourselves" in the capital of the motherland, most provincial capitals, and many medium-sized cities.

    我们自己的汽车是怎样制造出来的
    新华社记者　尹崇敬
    今年5月下旬的全国所有报纸上几乎都登载过这样一张照片：毛主席含笑乘“东风”。那是5月21日下午，我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席乘坐了长春第一汽车制造厂试制成功的我国第一辆小轿车——“东风”，在怀仁堂后花园内缓缓行驶了两周，毛主席下车以后，对聚集在周围的中共八大二次会议的代表们欣慰地微笑说：“坐了我们自己制造的小汽车了”！
    现在，离开毛主席讲这句话才两个多月，“我们自己制造的小汽车”已经不只“东风”一种，又出现了重庆的“先进”、北京的“井冈山”、天津的“和平”，一跃而为四种了。今年以来，连同小轿车在内，全国已有十七个省、市、自治区试制成功了五十种汽车，它们的品种相当齐全，有轻型及中型载重汽车、三轮货车、自动装卸车、万能农用汽车、城市洒水车，有大客车、小轿车、吉普车，还有一种两个人可以抬起来的微型小汽车。我们的汽车制造工业到目前为止还是一个刚满两岁的小孩，可是在今年短短的几个月内，已使自己成长到插翅高飞的阶段了。
    这许多“我们自己制造的汽车”到底是怎样制造出来的呀？现在，一个能够从多方面解答这个问题的机会来到了。
    7月下半月，第一机械工业部第六局在天津市召开了技术革新经验交流大会，全国各地亲手制造汽车的能工巧匠以及工厂的领导人聚首一堂，他们并且带来了自己制造的汽车和许多技术革新的展品，举办了一个丰富多彩的展览会。
          能工巧匠艺夺天工
    这个展览会大门外广场的最前边，首先陈列的是“井冈山”和“和平”牌两辆新式的流线型小轿车。这一对在一个星期之内（6月20日和25日）双双降生的姐妹车把观众们的视线一下子就吸引住了。一个是周身乳白色的素裹，一个是上部蛋青下部天蓝的淡装；一个在前额镶着峰峦层叠的“井冈山”，一个在车头伏着展翅欲飞的“和平”鸽。她们的外观和线条，首先给人一种优美的印象。
    北京厂和天津厂的同志向我介绍了各种情况。原来这两个厂，一个是汽车附件厂，一个是汽车修理厂，在今年生产大跃进思想大解放的高潮中，工人们提出了生产汽车的要求，让自己的工厂从修理变成制造，从“附件”升为“正件”。但是，生产汽车毕竟不是一件轻而易举的事情，而小轿车的制造困难更多。比如车盖、车门、钢圈、轮鼓等需要冲压的零件达一千多个，他们既没有图纸又没有模具。怎么办呢？北京厂的工人们提出了豪迈的口号：“以淮海战役的声势，智取华山的智谋，上甘岭的战斗精神来克服困难”。设计人员们先按本厂设想的独特风格，用橡皮泥捏出了一辆汽车的模型，给大家鉴定修改。北京市手艺最高的钣金工二十多人前来参加这个光荣的工作，他们用自己纯熟的巧手一锤锤地敲出了那些技术要求相当高的零件，经过磨光或喷漆之后，谁也不能认出它们竟是手工的产品。
    装璜设备特别考究，是小轿车的又一特点。清华大学、中央工艺美术学院的教授和学生、天津市能干的金匠分别参加了“井冈山”和“和平”的美术设计。北京、天津两市和全国各大城市的四十多个工厂，为她们制作了仪表、电器、收音机、油漆、玻璃、橡胶、靠垫等二百七十多种协作件。因此，工人们说：我们的小轿车是共产主义大协作的产物。
        跟农民商量从农村出发
    在“井冈山”和“和平”旁边展出的有一辆“洛阳”牌万能农用汽车，它就是人们所说的“有厂长、有工人、没有厂房”的洛阳市汽车修配厂制造的。了解情况的人们都认为，在这样一个工厂里生产出这样好的汽车来，简直是中外未闻的神话。当时，这个厂全厂只有一百二十几人，没有一个工程师或者技术员，仅有的五部普通机床又破又旧，可是他们敢想敢作，一定要制造出汽车来。他们凭着什么呢？这个厂的厂长告诉我，他们凭着一条无比优越的条件：有着一批老的熟练的修理工人。这批工人谁都亲手修理过十多种厂牌的汽车，有人还作过十几年的汽车司机，他们是最聪明不过的。
      “洛阳”牌汽车的生产过程是非常别致的。它的设计不是在办公室里进行，而是由工人组成一个试制技术研究小组，到农村去进行调查和农民们商量着办的，他们根据农村道路狭窄的特点，把车身设计得和马车差不多宽差不多长，凡是马车能够通过的地方它都能走，又根据农村需要多种用途的情况，在车底下装了一根动力输出轴。当汽车不开的时候，可以用来带动磨面、抽水、榨油、轧棉花的机器，还可以发电。就是说，它是一辆汽车又是一座流动动力站。
    在制造这辆汽车的时候，那几间算不得厂房的屋檐和车身一般高的茅草屋，根本活动不开，锻工们就在野外搭起帆布棚来工作，翻砂工人在地上挖一个坑，砌上几块耐火砖就算一个熔炉。由于设备太缺乏，除了发动机等少数部件外，全都是工人们以手工千锤万击敲打出来的，工人们一面敲打一面大搞技术革新，先后创造和改进了六十四种工具，使生产效率逐渐提高起来。
          土洋结合自力更生
    南京汽车修配厂（现在已升为汽车制造厂）的同志给我讲了一个故事：今年春节是冲压车间主任韩玉成同志早就选定了的结婚佳日，除夕晚上，前来贺喜的亲戚朋友全都到齐了，新娘也梳装停当，就待举行婚礼，可是新郎不见了，怎么等也等不着，一直让新娘静守到夜半十二点以后，他才姗姗迟来，原来他当晚没有下班，留在车间内参加了赶制“跃进”牌汽车大梁的最后一场战斗。
    压制大梁是制造汽车的一个重要关键，南京厂在这方面大胆创造土洋结合自力更生解决困难，作出了突出的贡献。按照现代化的正规生产需要巨大的压力机，长春第一汽车制造厂使用的就是三千五百吨的压力机，这部机器有三层楼高，单是四个紧固螺丝每个就有二十五吨重。而南京厂的设备零件怎样呢？有一部压机压力只有二百二十吨，不及长春厂的十五分之一，不能使用。再说订制一套压大梁的正规模具得一年多的时间，要几十吨铸钢，六万元成本，这又是一件办不到等不及的事儿。于是，南京厂派人到各地参观访问，寻求启发，又召开了十多次有老工人、工程技术人员和领导干部参加的“三结合”会议，一个土洋结合的方案终于被他们想出来了：充分利用那台二百二十吨的小压力机，采用钢板焊接结构而不用铸钢件自己制造出简陋的土模具，破例地把大梁分成三段压制。这一个土洋结合压大梁的发明，就在今年春节的那天夜里最后成功了。
    五千四百四十七个零件
    武汉的一对“红旗”牌越野车的诞生，又是一件不平凡的事情。
    武汉汽车修配厂在试制的时候，没有一张图纸，而是从交际处借来了一辆旅行车，把它全部拆开，拆成五千四百四十七个零件，一个个编上号码，又一个个照出相片，让工人仔细参考，自己也做出两套来。说来容易做来难，一般的零件参考着做是可以的，至于许多内部结构复杂，眼睛看不清的零件就不成了，必须切开解剖。可是，借来的东西怎么能随便解剖呢？别的途径没有，只有凭老工人的智慧和经验了。其中最复杂的零件要数汽缸，人们称它为汽车的“心脏”，诚然，它的复杂程度比之人的心脏有过之而无不及，在那尺把长的小小汽缸体和它的薄薄的汽缸壁内，错综着三十三条油道、水道、烟道和马达、轴承、偏心轴的架孔。工人们在制作这个汽车“心脏”时表现了巨大的能耐和高度的毅力，第一只汽缸体经翻砂翻出来以后，发现有砂眼漏水，又由于放置砂型时看不见摸不准，结果内外不对口，不得不重翻第二次，仍然失败，直到出车的前三天才把它做成功。全体参加试制的工人，奋战四十三天，多少不眠之夜接着不眠之夜，一周苦战又接着一周苦战，终于在6月28日，向党的生日献礼的一对珍贵的礼品制造出来了。中共湖北省委第一书记王任重同志亲自为它们定名为“红旗”，勉励全厂工人在最短期间内，让这面胜利的“红旗”插遍全省。
    其他地区，如綦江、沈阳、上海、济南、哈尔滨、福州、包头、合肥、贵阳……各地汽车修理厂或者汽车配件厂的工人，都以十二分的干劲做出了自己的汽车。现在，我国的汽车制造工业真是百花齐放，美不胜收，许多厂已经或准备将他们的试制的样品成批的投入生产，各厂纷纷提出要在今年内生产几十辆、几百辆以至一千辆汽车，全国的计划包括“解放”牌在内则是二万辆。亲爱的读者同志们，在今年国庆九周年的时候，你们将会在祖国的首都、绝大部分省城和许多中等城市，看到“我们自己制造的汽车”的雄伟的行列。
