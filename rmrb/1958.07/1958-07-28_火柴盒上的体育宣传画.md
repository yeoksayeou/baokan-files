    Matchbox Sports Propaganda Posters

    (By our reporter) The Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission recently printed a set of twelve colored sports pictures, including basketball, volleyball, and weightlifting, to be used as sports propaganda posters on matchboxes. Each picture includes a brief introduction to the sport. For example, the martial arts picture says: "The human body's blood vessels are like the Yangtze River, injury in one place affects all. Practice hard in the depths of winter and the heat of summer, to prolong life and maintain health." The calisthenics propaganda picture says: "Calisthenics are effective, do them often, and your body will be healthy." The characteristics of these propaganda posters are low cost, wide dissemination, penetration into the masses, and simple and vivid presentation, making them easily accepted by the masses. The Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission has printed 4.23 million copies and distributed them to seven match factories throughout the province for use.

    火柴盒上的体育宣传画
    本报讯　江苏省体委最近印制了一种彩色体育画，有篮球、排球、举重等一套，共十二幅，作为火柴盒的体育宣传画。每一幅画上印有这一运动项目的简单介绍。如武术这一幅画上印有：“人身血脉似长江，一处不到一处伤，冬练三九夏练伏，延年益寿保健康”。广播操宣传画上印有：“广播操，有功效，经常做，身体好”。这种宣传画的特点是用钱不多，宣传广泛，深入群众，并且简单生动，容易为群众接受。江苏省体委已印制了四百二十三万份，赠送给全省七个火柴厂使用。
