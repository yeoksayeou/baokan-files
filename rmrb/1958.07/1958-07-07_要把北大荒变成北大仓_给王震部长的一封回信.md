    To Turn the Great Northern Wilderness into a Great Granary
    -- A Reply to Minister Wang Zhen
    Xu Xiangguo
    After reading your letter to me on the eighth page of the "People's Daily" on May 26, I am extremely grateful for your concern for us and your encouragement.
    I completely agree with your suggestion to compose the song "Never Lay Down the Gun" and your opinions on its revision. Originally, this kind of voice should be sung in chorus by thousands of soldiers, and you, first of all, sang the strongest voice as an ordinary soldier and ordinary pioneer! This is a great encouragement to me and my comrades!
    General, Minister, I would like to report on the situation here.
    The Great Northern Wilderness is truly rich. The newly turned soil is black and oily, and very fertile. When we drink the well water here, we feel that it has a strong earthy fragrance. The forests are full of roe deer, wild boars, deer and many valuable medicinal materials such as ginseng. The mountain slopes are full of wild fruits and vegetables. The rivers are rich in various kinds of fish… As long as you are diligent, you can reap the harvest by reaching out your hand.
    Now, the battle to march into the wilderness and overcome difficulties has been fully launched! Braving the wind and rain, ignoring the sun, despising all difficulties, some people have plunged into rushing to cultivate and plant; some have started building roads; some have gone up the mountains to cut wood and build houses; in order to reduce state expenditure and solve their own difficulties, and to increase wealth for the country and the farm, hunting teams have also been organized to hunt in the mountains, fishing teams to catch fish in the rivers, and family members and women are also like everyone else, pulling plows, sowing seeds, cutting grass… We are fighting mightily on the vast and boundless wilderness.
    In our production brigade, there are company commanders, political instructors, platoon leaders, staff officers, assistants, teachers, military academy students, and soldiers; there are comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds, as well as intellectuals. They are doing various jobs, growing up in various places, but the Great Northern Wilderness connects them. They are united together, twisted into a rope, and pick up hoes in the same way. Because of the needs of revolutionary work, two officers who had never cooked before became cooks; an officer learning to drive a tractor only spent two days before he got on the tractor driver's seat; more officers put down the "regulations," bought agricultural technology books, and wanted to make themselves both red and expert. Here, overcoming difficulties has simply become a kind of fun. A second lieutenant assistant, when answering someone who asked him why he was willing to leave the warm south and give up the opportunity to find love to come to the Great Northern Wilderness, said: "Because the Great Northern Wilderness is the richest, and also because the Great Northern Wilderness is the most arduous." Life in the Great Northern Wilderness is colorful, arduous, and very valuable. We are all proudly aware that we are proponents of continuous revolution. In the past, we shed blood for the people to fight the world, and today we sweat for the people to build socialism.
    Now, we are marching into the wilderness with the might of a thousand troops and horses, and the force of overturning mountains and overturning seas! The spring of the wilderness has arrived. We are determined to make the Great Northern Wilderness a granary as soon as possible, and to make the Great Northern Wilderness as full of vitality and singing as we are.

### 要把北大荒变成北大仓——给王震部长的一封回信

    要把北大荒变成北大仓
    ——给王震部长的一封回信
    徐先国
    读到您在5月26日“人民日报”第八版上给我的信，我万分感谢您对我们的关怀和对我的鼓励。
    您说将“永不放下枪”谱成歌曲和对它的修改意见，我非常同意。本来，这种声音就应该由千万个兵士共同合唱出来的，而您，首先以一个普通士兵、普通垦荒者的身份唱出了最强音！这对我和我的战友们来说，真是莫大的鼓舞！
    将军、部长同志，顺便向您汇报一下我们这里的情况。
    北大荒真富。那新翻起的泥土，黑油油的，非常肥沃；当我们喝着这里的井水时，都觉着带有很浓的土香味；森林里有狍子、野猪、鹿以及人参等许多贵重药材；山坡上到处是野果、野菜；河里头盛产多种鱼类……只要勤劳，伸手就有收获。
    现在，向荒地进军、向困难进军的战斗已经全面打响了！冒着风雨，不避日晒，藐视一切困难，一部分人投入了抢耕抢种；一部分人开始了修路；一部分人上山伐木、建造房屋；为了减少国家开支和解决自身困难，为了给国家和农场增加财富，还组织了打猎队上山打猎，打鱼队下河捕鱼，家属妇女们也和大家一样，拉犁、撒种、割草……我们正浩浩荡荡地战斗在广阔无垠的荒原上面。
    我们生产大队里有连长、政治指导员、排长、参谋、助理员、教员、军校学员以及士兵；有工农出身的同志，也有知识分子。他们干着各种不同的工作，生长在各个地方，但北大荒把他们连起来了。他们团结在一起，拧成一股绳，一样的拿起了锄头。因为革命工作需要，两个以前并没做过饭的军官当了炊事员；一个学习开拖拉机的军官只花了两天的功夫就登上了拖拉机司机台；更多的军官放下了“条令”，买来了农业技术书籍，要使自己又红又专。在我们这里，克服困难简直成了一种乐趣。一个少尉助理员在回答别人问他为什么愿意离开暖和的南方、并且放弃获得爱情的机会来到北大荒的时候说：“因为北大荒最富，也因为北大荒最艰苦”。北大荒的生活多采、艰苦，非常难得。我们都自豪地感到我们是不断革命论者。过去为人民流血打天下，今天又为人民去流汗建设社会主义。
    现在，我们正以千军万马之威、排山倒海之势向荒野进军！荒地之春来到了。我们决心让北大荒早日变成大仓，让北大荒和我们一样充满朝气，歌声四起。
