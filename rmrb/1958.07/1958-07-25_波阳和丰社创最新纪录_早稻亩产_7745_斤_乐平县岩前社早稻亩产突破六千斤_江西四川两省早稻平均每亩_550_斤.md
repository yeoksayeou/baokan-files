According to a Central People's Broadcasting Station report, Zhu Shunxi, the Party Branch Secretary of Hefeng Cooperative in Sanmiaoqian Township, Boyang County, Jiangxi Province, and six others jointly cultivated a 1.22 mu experimental plot of early rice, which yielded a total of 9449 jin, averaging 7745 jin per mu. The on-site inspection was conducted by Ge Fengxiang, Secretary of the CPC Boyang County Committee, Zhang Hongfu, Deputy Secretary, and Yao Genbao, head of the Provincial Party Committee's agricultural inspection team, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, Leping, July 23rd: The early rice yield per mu in Yanqian Agricultural Cooperative in Leping County, Jiangxi Province, has broken the 6000 jin mark. The 1.09 mu of early rice harvested on the 22nd, after drying and winnowing, yielded 6243 jin of dry grain, equivalent to over 6187 jin of dry grain per mu, setting the highest record for early rice production to date.

This plot was an experimental field cultivated by the first team's first group of members in the Yanqian Cooperative. The early rice yield per mu last year was over 500 jin.

Upon inspection during harvesting, each tiller had between 16 and 20 stalks, the rice stalks were generally over four and a half feet tall, each as thick as a chopstick, and the panicles were long and full of grain. The rice panicles were generally eight inches to one foot long, with the longest reaching one foot two inches, and each panicle had an average of over 100 grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 24th: Jiangxi Province's early rice harvest has entered its busiest season, and news of bumper harvests is constantly flying in from all over the province. The 5.3 million mu of early rice already harvested has generally increased production by 70% to 80% compared to last year, with an average yield per mu exceeding 550 jin.

New records of high yields are being set daily across the province, and miracles of large-scale bumper harvests are constantly emerging. The average yield per mu of seven mu of land in Hongcao Cooperative, Chengjiao Second Cooperative, Raobu Cooperative in Boyang County, and Gugang Agricultural Cooperative in Leping County exceeded 4000 jin. The 1.09 mu early rice experimental field in Yanqian Cooperative, Leping County, even created a record of 6187 jin per mu. The average yield per mu of over 1000 mu of early rice fields already harvested in Liming Cooperative in Duchang County and Nianfeng Cooperative in Pingxiang County reached over 1200 jin. In Nanchang County, among the 400,000 mu of early rice already harvested, the average yield per mu of 56,000 mu reached 1000 jin.

The Gannan region, which previously had lower yields, has seen its average yield per mu of 1.6 million mu of early rice already harvested reach over 500 jin, surpassing the total yield for the entire year last year in a single season. In the mountainous Chongyi County, known as "no flat land to step on, no hundred households in a village," the average yield per mu of the first batch of early rice harvested also reached 432 jin, an increase of 35% compared to last year.

In these days of unprecedented bumper harvests, the farmers of Jiangxi are beaming with joy, and a scene of jubilation is evident everywhere.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 24th: Sichuan Province's 19 million mu of early rice has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Currently, from both banks of the Yangtze River to the foothills of the Daba Mountains, from the Qutang Gorge to the Chengdu Plain, the early rice has been mostly harvested across thousands of miles of the basin. The total early rice production in the province may reach over 10 billion jin; the average yield per mu is over 550 jin, an increase of 18% compared to last year's provincial average of 470 jin per mu, and even more than 50 jin higher than last year's average yield per mu for mid-season rice.

This year, the increase in early rice production in many places is no longer a few percent, but tens or even hundreds of percent. In previous years, early rice rarely exceeded the 500 jin mark, but this year, yields of 1000 jin per mu are common everywhere.

This year, the planting area for double-cropping early rice in the province has expanded by 8.6 million mu. In order to strengthen production leadership, all levels and departments have sent large numbers of cadres to the countryside to go barefoot into the fields and provide concrete leadership. During the growth process of early rice, Party committees at all levels also organized production inspection teams to conduct evaluations and inspections in the fields, which strongly promoted field management work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 24th: Anhui Province has achieved a widespread bumper harvest of double-cropping early rice, and high-yield records have also appeared in early-maturing varieties such as "Zaojian," "Zhongxingbai," and "503," which were previously considered low-yield varieties by many. The recently harvested 1.5 mu of "Zaojian" variety double-cropping early rice in Baojiaqiao Agricultural Cooperative, Qianrenqiao Township, Shucheng County, actually yielded 5908 jin, averaging 3939 jin per mu. The six mu of "Zhongxingbai" variety early rice already harvested by Sunwan Agricultural Cooperative in Qianrenqiao Township averaged 1365 jin per mu. The 14.3 mu of "Zaojian" variety early rice already harvested by Huojian Agricultural Cooperative in Shiji Township, Guangde County, averaged 1240 jin per mu, with one mu yielding 2178 jin.

The main reasons for the bumper harvest of these low-yield varieties are: generally, dense planting of over 30,000 plants per mu, over 2000 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and careful management.

    波阳和丰社创最新纪录
    早稻亩产7745斤
    乐平县岩前社早稻亩产突破六千斤
    江西四川两省早稻平均每亩550斤
    据中央人民广播电台消息　江西省波阳县三庙前乡和丰社党支书朱顺喜等七人合种的一亩二分二厘早稻试验田，共收九千四百四十九斤多，平均每亩实收七千七百四十五斤。当场验收的有中共波阳县委书记葛凤翔、副书记张洪福和省委农业检查团负责人姚根保等。
    据新华社乐平23日电　江西省乐平县岩前农业社早稻亩产突破六千斤大关。22日收割的一亩零九毫早稻，经过晒干扬净，收干谷六千二百四十三斤，折合亩产干谷六千一百八十七斤多，创造目前早稻丰产的最高纪录。
    这丘田是岩前社第一队第一组社员种的试验田，去年早稻亩产量是五百多斤。
    在收割时检查，每蔸分蘖都在十六至二十根，稻秆普遍高达四尺五寸以上，根根都有筷子般粗，而且穗长粒饱，谷穗一般八寸至一尺，最长的有一尺二寸，每穗平均有一百多粒谷。
    据新华社南昌24日电　江西省的早稻已进入收割大忙时期，丰收的喜讯不断从全省各地飞来。已收割的五百三十万亩早稻，一般都比去年增产七成到八成，平均亩产量超过了五百五十斤。
    全省高额丰产纪录正在日新又新，大面积丰收的奇迹不断涌现。波阳县洪曹社、城郊二社、饶埠社和乐平县古港农业社等单位就有七亩田的平均亩产量超过四千斤。乐平县岩前社的一亩零九毫早稻试验田，更创造了亩产六千一百八十七斤的纪录。都昌县黎明社、萍乡县年丰社已收割的一千多亩早稻田，平均亩产量达到一千二百多斤。南昌县在已经收割的四十万亩早稻中，就有五万六千亩的平均亩产量达到一千斤。
    过去产量较低的赣南区，已经收割的一百六十万亩早稻平均亩产量达到五百多斤，一季超过了去年全年。被称为“地无出步平，庄无百户人”的崇义县山区，第一批收割的早稻平均亩产量也达四百三十二斤，比去年增产35％。
    在这空前大丰收的日子里，江西农民喜气洋洋，到处呈现一片欢乐的景象。
    据新华社成都24日电　四川省一千九百万亩早稻获得空前丰收。目前，从长江两岸到大巴山下，从夔门三峡到川西平原，在纵横千里的盆地上，早稻已大部收完。全省早稻总产量可达一百多亿斤；平均每亩产量在五百五十斤以上，比去年全省早稻平均每亩四百七十斤增加18％，比去年中稻平均每亩产量还高出五十多斤。
    今年许多地方早稻增产幅度不再是百分之几，而是百分之几十甚至一倍。往年早稻很少超出五百斤大关，但今年每亩达到一千斤的到处都有。
    今年全省双季稻早稻的种植面积扩大了八百六十万亩。为了加强生产领导，各级各部门都下放大批干部深入农村，脱鞋下田，进行具体领导。在早稻生长过程中，各级党委又曾组织生产检查团，深入田间评比检查，有力地推动了田间管理工作。
    据新华社合肥24日电　安徽省双季早稻普遍丰收，连过去被很多人认为是低产品种的“早尖”、“中性白”、“五○三”等早熟品种也出现了高产纪录。舒城县千人桥乡鲍家桥农业社最近收割的一亩五分“早尖”品种的双季早稻，实收五千九百零八斤，平均亩产三千九百三十九斤。千人桥乡的孙湾农业社已收割的六亩“中性白”品种的早稻，平均亩产一千三百六十五斤。广德县施集乡火箭农业社已收割的十四点三亩“早尖”品种的早稻，平均亩产一千二百四十斤，其中有一亩产量达到二千一百七十八斤。
    这些低产品种获得丰收的主要原因是：一般每亩密植三万棵以上，基肥双千担以上，并精心管理。
