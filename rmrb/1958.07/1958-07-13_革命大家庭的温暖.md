    The Warmth of the Revolutionary Big Family
    After reading Qin Xiulan’s exposition on "Big Family" and "Small Family," I deeply felt how beautiful, how happy, and how attractive this socialist "Big Family" is! Over the past year of rectification, the face of our society and the relationships between people have undergone tremendous and profound changes. This time, it is not just one family or one person changing, but 600 million people across the country changing. Our motherland is a "Big Family" of 600 million people, and everywhere you can feel the happiness and warmth of this "Big Family." Beijing, the capital of our motherland, I had left for over a year. This time, I came back for a short business trip and found that its social atmosphere had made even greater progress than a year ago. When I stepped out of the train station and onto the trolleybus for the first time, I saw the conductor holding a large bunch of paper fans and was a little surprised. Why is the conductor also selling fans? After getting on the bus, I completely understood. The conductor would often say kindly: "Comrades! Is it hot? Here are fans, please use them," "Comrades! Are you thirsty? Here is boiled water, please drink it! Don't be polite," "Comrades! Here are picture books..." He smiled broadly, handing out fans to one person, pouring boiled water for another, and then passing over a picture book. As passengers got off the bus, he sincerely waved goodbye to them, "Comrades! Goodbye!" At this time, a series of farewells rang out, "Goodbye! Goodbye!" This scene was even livelier than visiting relatives. On the street, I also saw "unmanned stores" and cinemas with no ticket collectors everywhere. Of course, such a socialist "Big Family" has greater significance than a "Small Family."
    From this, I thought that temporary gatherings on trolleybuses and in shops make people feel a warmth and joy of a big family. Wouldn't it further intensify this warmth and joy if people's daily lives were also linked together due to common labor? What's so particularly worth cherishing about that monotonous small family life?

### 革命大家庭的温暖

    革命大家庭的温暖
    读了秦绣兰关于“大家”和“小家”的阐述，使我深深地感到这个社会主义的“大家”是多么美丽，多么幸福，多么吸引人呵！整风一年多来，我国社会的面貌，人与人之间的关系，都在经历着巨大的、深刻的变化。这次不是一家一户或一人在变，而是全国六亿人民都在变。我们的祖国就是一个六亿人民的“大家”，到处都可以感到这个“大家”的幸福和温暖。北京——祖国的首都，我离开她已经一年多了，这回短期出差重来，发现她的社会风气比一年前有了更大的进展。当我步出火车站第一次踏上电车的时候，看见售票员拿着一大把纸扇，就有点奇怪，怎么售票员还推销扇子吗？等上了车以后就完全明白了。售票员不时亲切地说：“同志们！热了吧？这里有扇子，请用吧”，“同志们！渴了吧？这里有开水，请喝吧！别客气”，“同志们！这里有小画书”……他笑迷迷的，一会儿给这个送扇子，一会儿给那个倒开水，一会儿又递过一本小画书来。乘客下车了，他真诚地跟他们招手告别“同志们！再见啦！”，这时响起了一连串的惜别声“再见！再见！”这情形，简直比走亲戚还热闹。在街上，我还到处看到“无售货员商店”和无人收票的电影院。像这样的社会主义“大家”当然比“小家”有着更加重大的意义。
    由此我想到，在电车上、商店里临时的相聚，都使人感到一种大家庭的温暖和乐趣，那末，由于共同劳动的关系，把人们的日常生活也联结在一起，不就更加加浓了这种温暖和乐趣了吗？原来那种单调的小家庭生活，还有什么特别值得留恋的呢？
