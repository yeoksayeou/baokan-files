    Hegang Builds a Three-Story Building in Ten Days
    (Our Dispatch) The Hegang City Construction Engineering Company, learning from the rapid construction method of the Harbin 101 construction site, built a three-story, 2,140-square-meter, mixed-structure dormitory building for single employees in ten days, from June 16 to June 25. In terms of construction speed for civil buildings, it has surpassed the new records recently set in Harbin, Wuhan, and other places. After joint appraisal by engineering technicians and veteran workers, the project quality was rated as excellent, and the cost was reduced by 11.4% compared to the plan (budget).
    The employees of the Third Engineering Team, who were responsible for the construction of this building, initially planned to complete the task in three and a half months at the beginning of spring this year. Inspired by the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the construction workers proposed the slogan "Build the Building in Ten Days."
    After comrades from the provincial and municipal Party committees' inspection teams came to the construction site to publicize the General Line to the workers, the workers' enthusiasm was even greater. The labor team completed all the trench excavation work in 135 minutes. Personnel were selected from each work process to participate in daily management. They gave full play to their creativity, rationally improved the work process, and auxiliary work types created conditions for the bricklaying process. While utilizing some small-scale mechanization to replace heavy manual labor, they especially expanded the prefabricated components (accounting for about 50% of the entire project). Except for bricklaying, plastering, and foundation construction, which were carried out on-site, most of the other work was prefabricated, enabling the building to be completed quickly.

    鹤岗十天盖成一座三层楼
    本报讯  鹤岗市建筑工程公司学习哈尔滨一○一工地快速施工法，从6月16日到6月25日，以十天时间盖成一座二千一百四十平方公尺的三层混合结构的独身宿舍楼房。在民用建筑施工速度方面，超过了哈尔滨、武汉等地最近出现的新纪录。经过工程技术人员和老工人的共同鉴定，工程质量评为优等，成本较计划降低11.4％（概算）。
    担任这所大楼施工的第三工程队职工，在今年春初，计划用三个半月时间来完成这项任务，在全国大跃进形势鼓舞下，建筑职工们提出了“十天建成大楼”的口号。
    在省、市委检查团的同志到工地向工人宣传总路线后，工人干劲更大，力工队以一百三十五分钟的时间，挖完了全部地槽工程。各个工序都选出了参加日常管理的人员来管理。他们充分发挥了创造精神，合理的改进了工序，辅助工种为砌砖工序创造条件，在利用部分小型机械化代替笨重体力劳动的同时，特别扩大了预制品构件（约占全部工程的50％），除砌砖、抹灰、砌基础等工程在现场施工外，其它大部分都是预制品，使大楼能迅速建成。        （郭九龙）
