We Have Thoroughly Uprooted Poverty
Cui Xiyan, Head of Yingju Agricultural Cooperative, Fengqiu County, Henan Province

Cadre Participation in Production Has Many Benefits

On the basis of the Socialist Education Movement, the cooperative carried out party rectification, league rectification, and cooperative rectification. First, we mobilized the masses to speak out freely, and they affirmed the achievements of the cooperative over the past two years. On the basis of affirming the achievements, more than four hundred suggestions were made regarding the cooperative's management and the work style of the cadres. These suggestions can be summarized as: four more, three less, two strong, and one different. The four mores are: cadres smoking foreign cigarettes more, drinking more, wearing foreign cloth uniforms more, and sleeping in more; the three lesses are: less participation in production labor, less consultation with the masses, and less publication of financial accounts; the two strongs are: strong subjectivity and strong attitude; and the one different is special performance in all aspects, different from the masses. After these opinions were raised, the cooperative's party branch promptly studied, analyzed, and inspected them, explaining that more than 90% of the opinions were correct. Just from the item of less participation in production, the four cooperative cadres often did not participate in production, busy with other scattered trivial matters, and the sixty people including the positive and vice captains, positive and vice accountants, and security guards of the fourteen production teams also often did not participate or participated very little. How could the masses have no opinions! With so many people not actively participating in production, how could the production plan be completed! Why? There were three hundred and sixty male and female semi-laborers in the whole cooperative. When we planned the tasks, we included these sixty-four people. These sixty-four people were all full laborers, over twenty and under forty, without drags and pulls. If they do not actively participate, how can the task be accomplished? Moreover, these people do not participate in production, but their labor remuneration is not low. Each person averages three hundred workdays. Calculated according to the labor value of five jiao and five fen per workday in the disaster-stricken year last year, sixty-four people, nineteen thousand workdays, is more than eleven thousand yuan. This is not a small number! If you use it to buy grain, you can buy 150,000 jin, enough for all the people in our community to eat for five and a half months. If you buy bean cakes, you can buy 140,000 jin. If you use it to buy livestock, you can buy 220 cattle. As long as our cooperative buys 200 heads, the difficulty of lacking animal power can be solved.

After this calculation, the cadres regretted it. The party secretary cried and said that he was sorry to the Party and the masses. The Party and the masses expected us to lead the members to increase production and increase income. Why is our work style like this? Everyone’s inspection was very painful, and once they were deeply saddened, they strengthened their determination to resolutely change and completely change. After making up their minds ideologically, they put forward suggestions for improvement: work should fulfill obligations, and eating should rely on labor. The cadres all agreed to do this, so we started doing it.

How to do it? The head of the cooperative and the party secretary did not record work points for doing work in the cooperative, and they fulfilled their obligations for free. The two accountants did work in the cooperative, because there was specific business, each was supplemented with fifty workdays, and the two were one hundred. According to the central regulations: The subsidy workdays for cadres of agricultural cooperatives should not exceed 1% of the total workdays. According to the central regulations, we should have more than 900 subsidy workdays! However, we only need the members to subsidize 100 workdays to the two accountants. No other workdays are needed. However, attending meetings in the province, county, and other places should be recorded, which is reasonable.

In this way, will it affect the income of cadres! Affect the lives of cadres! In order to solve this problem, when allocating work, we appropriately take care of the cadres' expertise. For example, I have the technology to feed livestock, and I still feed livestock. I feed five livestock, one workday a day, three hundred and sixty workdays a year. The two accountants feed ten sows. The cooperative stipulates seventy workdays a year for feeding one sow, and ten sows are seven hundred workdays; the party secretary contracted twenty acres of high-yield land, two hundred workdays a year. In this way, each person has an average income of more than three hundred yuan a year. Last year, I did not participate in production, and the cooperative subsidized it, and my income was 330 yuan; this year, I participated in production and did not ask the cooperative to subsidize it, and it became 390 yuan. In this way, not only will the income of cadres not be reduced, but also the income of cadres will be increased.

Some people ask: Is there a contradiction between production and work! At first, I also thought there was a contradiction, but after an experiment, there was no contradiction between production and work, only a contradiction in thinking. Take me as an example. In the past, I also had a cooperative director's office, with desks and chairs, very formal. Now it's different. My office is also a bedroom, with a desk for office work, a bed for sleeping, and livestock. I sleep here, work here, and work here. How is the time arranged? Get up at dawn in the morning. If you don’t get up, it won’t work! The donkey is barking! The chicken is crowing. If you sleep again, it is unwilling, you have a task. I hurriedly got up, added a nest of grass to the donkey, and then arranged the things the donkey needed that day, carrying three baskets of grass and carrying five loads of water. Then I went to the desk to read the newspaper and study the documents. After breakfast and before lunch is office time. If the masses have anything to do, or if the township leaders have anything to do, it is all done in the morning. If it is not finished, or if there is anything temporary in the afternoon, I have to go to the field to find me. I go to the field with a manure basket in the afternoon! I pick up manure while checking production. No matter whether it is the superior or the masses who come to me, I carry a manure basket, he holds an iron shovel, and we walk and study. It does not delay work, nor does it delay production. In the process of checking production, if small problems are found, they can be solved by discussing with the captain or with the masses in the field. If there are big problems that need to be discussed at a meeting, after dinner, a family meeting is held. The situation in the inspection work, such as any experience or any problems, is discussed. After the problems are solved, study the next stage of what to do, what to do tomorrow, what to do the day after tomorrow, and what to complete that day? In this way, it will take at most half an hour to disperse, and tomorrow everyone will handle things according to their own plans. After the meeting, I feed the livestock, and there is nothing to do. What to do? Rest. If there is nothing to do, what else can you do but rest? In this way, what is the contradiction between work and production, so I feel that it is a contradiction in thinking, not a real contradiction.

Once the cooperative cadres changed their work style, the production team leaders and accountants also changed. When they had not changed in the past, the cooperative cadres met the team leaders and criticized them, saying, "You production team leaders should produce!" The team leaders asked me in return: "What are you doing? Cooperative director!" I lowered my head and had nothing to say. Why? I can't set an example by myself, so I can't stand up straight to criticize others. Now that I participate in production, it's okay. You don't need to criticize. The team leaders and accountants said: "The cooperative director and the party secretary have done it. It would be embarrassing if we don't do it!" They did it with all their strength. Now sixty-four non-production cadres have become active laborers. The masses reflected: "The leadership of the Communist Party is really good. The cadres change when they say they will change. The cooperative cadres take the lead, and we have to work hard!" The labor enthusiasm of the masses is even greater.

It's really strange. Once the cadres participate in production, their work style also changes. The masses criticized the cadres for being four more in the free speech. This time, the cadres made four changes, that is, changing from smoking paper cigarettes to smoking dry tobacco, changing from drinking to abstaining from alcohol; changing from wearing foreign cloth uniforms to wearing native cloth uniforms, and changing from sleeping soundly to resting on time.

In addition, the masses have opinions on financial accounts, so we completely open up the financial accounts. First, we solve the financial legacy problems since the establishment of the cooperative, and then we establish a new financial system. The new financial system is formulated after full discussion by the masses. After implementing a section, we inspect a section, and if problems are found, we solve them in time. At the same time, we establish a financial account announcement system. Agricultural cooperatives and production teams all establish an income and expenditure table that knows the income and expenditure of the year early, and the members know clearly how much is used and how much is collected. In this way, the members are very satisfied and say: "The old things are solved, the new methods are formulated, and our thinking is bright."

Another point reflected by the members in the big speech and big release is: The cadres are subjective and rarely consult with the masses when things happen, which is an undemocratic style! In order to change this, we proposed to promote a new atmosphere of democracy. First, we seized the establishment of the old farmer advisory committee. Why should this committee be established? In the two years since the establishment of the cooperative, the old farmers had some opinions on some things. They proposed: "I am now in my fifties and sixties, and I have worked for decades. The set of experience and technology I have learned is now useless. The elementary and junior high school graduates just graduated yesterday and went to the county to study for three days. They came back and said they were technicians. When they arrived in the field, I had to listen to their command. He said how to do it, and I did it. If I didn't listen, hum! Violation of operating procedures! But if you ask him to show me, he won't." This shows that the old farmers have opinions, which is an internal contradiction! In order to solve this contradiction, we established an old farmer advisory committee. There are old farmers and new technicians in this committee, so that new and old technologies can be combined. When formulating production plans and operating procedures, everyone can express their opinions. In the committee, through big speaking, big release, and big debate, a principle was formulated: whether it is old experience or new technology, whichever is more conducive to the development of production, we will adopt that one. In this way, the contradiction is resolved, and both the old farmers and the new technicians are very satisfied, which is also conducive to production.

Our way of running the cooperative is actually following Chairman Mao's three principles on democratic cooperative management. The three principles are: first, financial openness; second, consultation with the masses when things happen; third, cadres must participate in production. It is precisely because we are doing it in accordance with these three principles that it is done correctly, and the masses are also satisfied, saying that there are five goods: the leadership of the Communist Party is good, the transformation of cadres is good, future production can be done well, agricultural cooperatives can be consolidated well, and socialist construction is good!

It is good for cadres to participate in production! But it is easy to say this sentence, but it is not so easy to do! There is ideological struggle! Take me as an example. At first, when I studied the documents and learned that cadres should change their work style and participate in production, I thought: The Party has told me to change, and I have to change! But I am afraid of three things when I participate in production: first, I am afraid of being embarrassed, second, I am afraid of being tired, and third, I am afraid of getting my clothes dirty. If you don’t participate, there are also three fears: first, you are afraid that the masses will raise opinions, second, you are afraid that the leaders will criticize you, and third, you are afraid that the agricultural cooperative will not be done well. These six fears are playing tricks in my head, and I can't make up my mind. Is it better to change, or not to change? The struggle is up. When the ideological struggle is the most fierce, a bad idea is produced: It's okay for cadres to spend a little brainpower! But now work fulfills obligations, and eating depends on labor. I have to spend my brains and labor. What do I want to do this for? I don't want to be a cadre, and I don't want to hurt my brain. Being an ordinary farmer, who knows how to farm and feed livestock, is not worried about getting hundreds of workdays a year. Thinking of this, I don't want to do it. Thinking about it again, my idea is wrong! The cadres are elected by the masses! The Party also cares and loves you very much. Why do you have this idea? If you have this idea, you are not qualified to be a cadre. If you want to be a cadre, the masses will not let you be a cadre! Because you are not qualified to be a cadre, why are you not qualified? First, you don't listen to the Party; second, you don't listen to the masses; third, you can't endure hardship. What qualifications do you have to be a cadre? I called my own name, "Cui Xiyan! You are not qualified to be a cadre, and you still want to quit?" Thinking of this, I felt that I must not fail the Party and the masses. I have to do it resolutely. After the ideological struggle is over, the energy will come. When planting wheat last year, I pushed the waterwheel, and the people in the field saw me. They kept looking and even stopped working. This one said: "The cooperative director is pushing the waterwheel!" That one said: "New thing." When I heard it, there were words in the words! This is a sharp criticism from the masses, and my face turned red without beating myself. I said to them: "I will resolutely turn new things into old things!" One day, I was on the street, holding a dry tobacco pouch and smoking dry tobacco. An old herdsman in his seventies came over, looked left and right, just like a novelty. After looking for a long time, he smiled and said, "Cooperative director, do you also smoke this?" When I heard it, there was a thorn in the words again, which was both criticism and encouragement to me. I said: "I want to change my work style and take the lead in saving money in the future!"

Going on like this, time passed quickly, and unknowingly it was more than two months. The masses saw me working, and they no longer regarded it as a new thing. My six fears were lifted, production labor became accustomed to, my thinking became pleasant, the internal contradictions of the agricultural cooperative were resolved, production was done well, the disaster was eliminated, and water conservancy was repaired. This shows that whether the work is done well or not has a lot to do with the work style of the cadres. Therefore, I deeply realize that: there are five major benefits for cadres to participate in production and change their work style. The first major benefit is: solving the internal contradictions of agricultural cooperatives and strengthening the relationship between the Party, the League, and the cadres and the masses; second, participating in production and understanding production can better lead production; third, being able to set an example and dare to boldly lead the masses to carry out criticism; fourth, exercising the body, I have the deepest experience on this point. Before I participated in production, my stomach disease was serious. It was not really great at that time! If I spoke for an hour, my stomach would hurt unbearably. After participating in production labor, it was really great! Now I can talk for ten or twelve hours a day, and my stomach doesn't hurt. This shows that the stomach disease in the past was caused by sleeping too much. Once I participated in production, all the problems were solved. The fifth benefit is saving money. Cadres don't make mistakes. In the past, many agricultural cooperative cadres made mistakes of embezzlement. Why? They like to smoke foreign cigarettes, wear good clothes, and drink alcohol. If they don't have money, they embezzle. Now that the work style has changed, and they don't spend so much money, they won't make this mistake.

I have said so much, and some people will definitely ask: Does your cooperative have any problems! Doing socialism! In the process of advancing, there will be no problems. Old problems are solved, and new problems come again. There will definitely be problems. Although there are problems, we believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely solve problems and continue to advance. We will turn the Party's general line into the strength of our entire cooperative and ensure the realization of a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958.

    我们彻底挖掉了穷根
    河南省封丘县应举农业社社长  崔希彦
    干部参加生产好处多
    在社会主义教育运动的基础上，社进行了整党、整团、整社。首先发动群众鸣放，群众肯定了建社二年来的成绩。在肯定成绩的基础上，对社里的经营管理、干部工作作风提出了四百多条意见，这些意见归纳起来是：四多、三少、两强、一不。四多是干部吸洋烟的多，喝酒的多，穿洋布制服的多，睡大头觉多；三少是参加生产劳动少，有事和群众商量少，财务账目公布少；两强是主观强，态度强；一不是各方面表现特殊，与群众不一样。这些意见一提出来以后，社党支部及时研究、分析、检查，说明90％以上的意见是正确的。单从少参加生产这一项来检查，四个社干部经常不参加生产，忙于其他零星小事，十四个生产队的正副队长，正副会计，治安保卫员共六十人也经常不参加或者很少参加，群众怎么会没意见哪！这么多人不积极参加生产，生产计划完不成哪！为什么呢？全社男女整半劳力三百六十个，我们在规划任务的时候，把这六十四人也打在里面，这六十四人都是整劳力，二十岁以上，四十岁以下，没拖的，没拉的，他们不积极参加，怎么会完成任务哪？而且这些人不参加生产，劳动报酬并不低，每个人平均三百个劳动日，按去年受灾年的劳动价值计算每个劳动日五角五分，六十四人，一万九千个劳动日，就一万一千多元。这可是一个不小的数字呀！拿它买粮食，能买十五万斤，够我们全社群众吃五个半月，如买豆饼，能买十四万斤，如拿它买牲口，能买二百二十头牛，我们社只要买二百头，就能解决缺少畜力的困难。
    这一算，干部都后悔起来了，支书哭起来了，说对不起党，对不起群众，党和群众指望我们领导社员增加生产，增加收入，我们为什么作风上是这个样子？大家检查得很沉痛，一沉痛，就坚定了决心，坚决改，彻底改。思想上一下决心以后，就提出了改进意见：工作尽义务，吃饭靠劳动。干部都同意这样干，我们就干开来了。
    如何干呢？社长、支书在社里做工作，一律不记工，白尽义务，两个会计在社里做工作，因为有具体业务，每人补五十个劳动日，两人一百个。按中央规定：农业社干部的补助工，不超过总工数的1％，如按中央规定，我们该有九百多个补助劳动日呢？可是，我们只要社员补助一百个工给两个会计就行了，其余干啥也不要工，可是上省、上县、上外地开会要记工，这是合理的。
    这样，是否会影响干部收入！影响干部生活呀！为了解决这个问题，在分配活儿的时候，适当照顾干部的专长。比如我有喂牲口的技术，仍喂牲口，我喂了五头牲口，一天一个工，一年三百六十个工。两个会计喂十头母猪，喂一个母猪，社里规定一年七十个劳动日，十头母猪就是七百个劳动日；支书包了二十亩丰产地，一年二百个劳动日。这样，每人平均一年有三百多元收入。去年我没有参加生产，由社补助，收入三百三十元；今年参加生产，不叫社补助，就成三百九了。这样，不仅不会减少干部收入，还增加了干部收入。
    有人问：是不是生产和工作有矛盾呀！起初我也认为有矛盾，可是一试验，生产和工作并没有矛盾，只是思想上的矛盾。拿我做例子，过去我也有一个社长办公室，里面搁了桌子、椅子，很正规，现在不同了，我的办公室也是卧室，里面有办公的桌子，睡觉的床，还有牲口，睡觉就在这里，办公就在这里，劳动就在这里，时间如何安排呢？早上黎明就起床，不起来不行啦！驴子鸣！鸡直叫，你再睡大头觉，它不愿意，你有任务了。我就急着起来，给驴添了一窝草，再安排这一天驴需要的东西，背上三箩草，担上五担水。接着就到办公桌旁边看看报纸，学学文件。早饭后，午饭前是办公时间，群众有啥事，乡领导上有啥事，都在上午办完，办不完，或下午有啥临时事儿，得上地找我，我下午背着粪筐上地啦！我边拾粪边检查生产，不管是上级，也不管是群众来找我，都是我背着粪箕，他拿着铁锹，我背着他铲着粪，咱俩人走着研究着，不耽误工作，也不耽误生产，一个下午，工作也研究了，检查了，粪也拾回来了。检查生产中，发现小问题，地里和队长或和群众一商量就解决了，有大问题需要开会，吃罢晚饭以后，生活会上一拉瓜，把检查工作中的情况，如有啥经验，有啥问题，说一说，解决以后，再研究下一段咋办，明天干啥，后天干啥，那一天完成啥？这样，顶多半个钟头就散了，明天各人就按各人的计划办事了。散会后，我喂完牲口，就没事儿了，干啥呢？休息，没事，不休息干啥？这样，工作、生产还有啥矛盾，所以我感到那是思想上的矛盾，不是真正的矛盾。
    社干部一转变作风，生产队长、会计也转变了，过去没有转变的时候，社干部遇见队长，批评他们说：“你们当生产队长的该生产哪！”队长反过来问我：“你弄啥呢？社长！”我低下头，没话说了，为什么呢？自己不敢以身作则，就挺不起腰来批评别人。这下一参加生产就行了，你不用批评，队长、会计说：“社长、支书都干了，咱不干可要丢人哪！”一个劲儿的干了。现在六十四名脱产干部都变成积极劳动者了，群众反映：“共产党领导真好，干部说改就改，社干部带头干，咱也得挂劲干！”群众的劳动热情也更大了。
    真怪，干部一参加生产，作风也跟着变了，群众鸣放中批评干部四多，这下干部就来个四变，就是变吸纸烟为吸旱烟，变喝酒为戒酒；变穿洋布制服为穿土布制服，变睡大头觉为按时休息。
    另外，群众对财务账目有意见，我们就把财务账目彻底公开，首先把建社以来的财务遗留问题解决了，然后又建立了新的财务制度，新的财务制度是经过群众充分讨论制定出来的，执行一个段落，检查一个段落，发现问题，及时解决，同时，建立财务账目公布制度，农业社，生产队，都建立一个一年收支早知道的收支表，用多少，收多少，社员都知道的清清楚楚。这样，社员很满意，说：“老事解决了，新办法制定了，咱们的思想亮堂了。”
    另一点社员在大鸣、大放中反映：干部主观强，遇事同群众商量少，这就是不民主的作风哪！为了改变这一条，我们提出发扬民主新空气，首先抓住建立老农顾问委员会，为啥要建立这个委员会呢？建社二年，有些事老农民有些意见，他们提出：“我现在五、六十岁了，劳动了几十年，学来的一套经验、技术现在都没啥了，高小、初中毕业生昨天才毕业，去县里学习三天回来，说是技术员，到地里，我得听他指挥，他说咋弄，我就咋弄，不听，哼！违反操作规程！可叫他做给我看，他又不会。”这说明老农有意见，这是个内部矛盾哪！为了解决这个矛盾，我们就建立了老农顾问委员会，这个委员会里老农也有，新技术员也有，这样就可以新、老技术相结合，在制定生产计划和操作规程的时候，大家发表意见。在委员会里，通过大鸣、大放、大争，制定了一个原则，老经验也好，新技术也好，那一条对于发展生产有利，就采取那一条，这样，就把这个矛盾解决了，老农、新技术员都很满意，对生产也有利。
    我们这样办社，实际是遵循毛主席关于民主办社的三个原则，这三个原则是：第一财务公开；第二有事和群众商量；第三干部要参加生产。正因为我们是遵照这三条做的，所以是做得正确的，群众也满意，说有五好：共产党领导好，干部转变的好，今后生产能搞好，农业社能巩固好，社会主义建设好！
    干部参加生产好是好哪！可就是这句话说起来容易，做起来就不那么容易啦！有思想斗争哪！还是拿我做例子，起初我学习文件，学到干部要转变作风，参加生产的时候，我就想：党叫改了，不改不行哪！可是我参加生产有三怕：第一怕丢人，第二怕累得慌，第三怕弄脏衣服。不参加吧，也有三怕，第一怕群众提意见，第二怕领导批评，第三怕农业社搞不好，这六怕思想在我脑袋瓜里作怪了，我拿不住主意了，改好，还是不改好？斗争起来了，思想斗争得最厉害的时候，产生了一种坏思想：当干部费点脑子没啥呀！可这下工作尽义务，吃饭凭劳动，我费了脑筋还得费劳动，我要弄这个干啥？我不当干部，不去伤这个脑筋，当个普通农民，会种地、会喂牲口，一年还愁不弄几百个劳动日，想到这里，我不想干了。再一想，我这想法不对头呀！当干部是群众选举你的呀！党对你也非常关心，爱护，你为啥要产生这个思想？你有这思想，你就没有资格当干部，你要当，群众还不叫你当呢！因为你没有资格当干部吆，为什么没有资格呢？第一、你不听党的话；第二、你不听群众的话；第三、你不能吃苦耐劳。你还有啥资格当干部？我自己叫着自己的名字，“崔希彦哪！你就没有资格当干部，你还想不干呢？”想到这里，我感到一定不能辜负党，辜负群众，我得坚决干，思想斗争过来了，劲儿也就来了。去年种麦的时候，我推着水车，地里的人看到我，一个劲儿看，连活儿也歇下来了，这个说：“社长推水车啦！”那个说：“新事儿。”我一听，话里有话呀！这是群众对我的尖锐批评，当时我的脸儿不打自红了，我对他们说：“我坚决把新事变成老事！”再有一天，我在街里，拿着旱烟袋儿，吸旱烟，有个七十多岁的老饲养员走过来，左看看，右看看，真当个新鲜事儿一样，看了半天，笑着说：“社长，你也吸这？”我一听话里又有刺儿，对我又是批评，又是鼓励，我说：“我要转变作风，今后要带头节约呀”！
    这样下去，时间过得很快，不知不觉两个多月了，群众看到我劳动，再也不当新事儿了，我的六怕思想解除了，生产劳动也习惯了，思想也愉快了，农业社的内部矛盾也解决了，生产也搞好了，灾情也消灭了，水利也修好了，这说明各项工作做的好不好，和干部作风有很大关系。因此，我深深体会到：干部参加生产，转变作风有五大好处，第一大好处是：解决了农业社内部矛盾，密切了党团、干群关系；第二、参加了生产，了解了生产，就能够更好的领导生产；第三、能够以身作则，敢大胆领导群众开展批评；第四、锻炼了身体，这一点我的体会最深了，我在参加生产以前，胃病严重，那时可不是真棒哪！说一个钟头话，胃就疼得受不了，参加生产劳动以后，才是真棒哩！现在一天说十个、十二个钟头话，胃也不疼了。这说明过去那个胃病，是睡大头觉睡出来的，一参加生产，啥问题都解决了。第五个好处是省钱，干部不犯错误了，过去，农业社干部有许多人犯贪污的错误，为什么呢？好吸个洋烟，好穿好衣服，好喝口酒，没钱，就贪污，现在作风转变了，不花那么多的钱，就不会犯这个错误了。
    我讲了那样多，有人一定会问：你们那个社是不是有问题呀！搞社会主义吆！是在前进当中，不会没有问题，旧问题解决了，新问题又来了，问题一定会有的。虽然有问题，但是我们相信，在共产党、毛主席领导下，我们一定能不断解决问题，不断前进，我们要把党的总路线变成我们全社的力量，保证实现1958年农业生产大丰收。
