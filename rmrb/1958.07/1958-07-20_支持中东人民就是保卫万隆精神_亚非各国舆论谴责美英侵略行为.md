Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Reports indicate that the US and British act of arson in the Middle East has provoked strong opposition from public opinion in Asian and African countries. Many newspapers continue to publish commentaries supporting the struggle of the people of the Middle East and demanding the withdrawal of US and British aggressor troops from the Middle East.

Cairo Newspapers Condemn British Aggression Against Jordan
Saying It Was A Foolish Act

Major Arabic newspapers in Cairo published editorials on the 18th condemning the British aggression against Jordan. These newspapers unanimously believed that the British occupation was just another link in the Anglo-American conspiracy to attack Iraq.

"Al-Gomhouria" stated that the purpose of the imperialist aggression was to strike at Arab nationalism.

"Al Akhbar" considered the British action to be "another foolish act" that had moved the world one step closer to the outbreak of war.

"Al-Ahram" stated that Britain had returned to Jordan to protect British interests and territories, which would once again be used as an imperialist base and springboard for attacking Middle Eastern countries.

Indian newspapers criticize American piracy
Believing This Is a Challenge to the People of Asia and Africa

The Indian "National Herald" editorial on the 18th supported the Soviet proposal in the Security Council calling for the United States to stop armed interference in the Middle East. The editorial said: "The Soviet Union is completely correct in calling this action by the United States an act of aggression, and the Soviet proposal accurately describes the facts." The newspaper also stated that the United States "is attempting to turn back history, and it will suffer a crushing defeat."

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" refuted the excuses made by US President Eisenhower and US Ambassador to the United Nations Lodge for the invasion of Lebanon, saying that their arguments "cannot cover up the ugly fact of the improper armed intervention by the United States in Lebanon."

The conservative "Times of India" also said in an editorial that the US and British acts of aggression in the Near and Middle East were a "gamble," and "from a legal and moral point of view, the intervention is completely indefensible."

The weekly "Blitz" said in an editorial: "The large-scale US interference in Lebanon's internal affairs is naked piracy." The editorial said that the US aggression is a challenge to the Bandung Spirit of the people of Asia and Africa and to the freedom and future of these two ancient continents. The editorial said that the people of Asia and Africa will accept this challenge and give a due response. The editorial also stated, "Just as heroic Egypt dealt a fatal blow to gunboat policy during the Suez War, the same fate awaits the large-scale intervention in Lebanon."

Pakistani Newspapers
Oppose Pakistani President's Support for US-British Aggression

The Urdu newspaper "Today" wrote on the 18th: "The recklessness shown by the United States and Britain in sending troops to Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan to undermine world peace should not be supported at all. The heads of the three Muslim member states of the Baghdad Pact support it, which does nothing to serve humanity."

The Urdu newspaper "Jang" said in an editorial on the 18th: "Pakistan should not foolishly always support its Western allies."

The evening newspaper "Leader" published an article stating that the recent revolution in Iraq clearly showed once again that puppet rulers have no place in the Middle East.

Be Vigilant Against New US Conspiracies in the United Nations
Burmese Newspapers Condemn Dirty US-British Policies

The influential Burmese newspaper "The People" published an editorial on the 18th calling on the people of the world to take united action against the US aggression against Lebanon. The editorial said that the landing of US troops in Lebanon and the US-British military activities in the Mediterranean were not only violations of the sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries, but also criminal acts endangering world peace.

Burma's largest circulation "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial condemning the US and British military activities in Lebanon and Jordan as interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq.

The All Burma Peasants Association's organ "The Union Daily" pointed out that interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is a dirty policy often pursued by the United States whenever its lackeys are ousted from power. The editorial also condemned the aggressive military actions taken by the United States in Korea under the name of the United Nations. The editorial called on countries to be vigilant against new US conspiracies.

Don't Forget the Lessons of Suez
British Newspapers Warn the Government

Many British bourgeois newspapers expressed concern about the consequences of the US-British armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan.

"News Chronicle" wrote on the 19th that, in the final analysis, the actions of the United States and Britain will only make the forces they want to suppress stronger.

"The Manchester Guardian" believes that British interference in the affairs of the Arab people is a "mistake" and a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The newspaper wrote that a foreign country interfering in the affairs of another country "is illegal even if it is at the request of another country." The newspaper said that the people of every country have the inalienable right to decide their own political system, "and if they like to adopt revolutionary methods, no other country has the right to oppose it."

"The Daily Mirror" criticized the British government in an editorial for not accepting the lessons of the Suez adventure. The newspaper wrote, "The Suez incident was a big mistake in history. And the landing of British troops in Jordan contains even greater dangers."

Labor MP Crossman also wrote in an article in this newspaper: "This Anglo-American gamble is even more reckless than the Anglo-French gamble two years ago." He expressed concern that this adventure "will bring us greater disaster." He called for "a high-level East-West conference to be convened before the situation becomes irreversible."

"The Daily Herald" also expressed opposition to armed intervention and called for a high-level conference between the Soviet Union and Western countries to resolve the conflict in the Middle East.

"Financial Times" expressed doubts in an editorial about the possibility of "relying on Western military power to ensure the constant stability of the Middle East."

West German Newspapers Comment on the Middle East Situation
The Future Does Not Belong to Oil Tycoons

Some West German newspapers believe that the road to Arab unity cannot be blocked. "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" wrote in a commentary on the 17th that the US action has created a danger to world peace "more urgent than after the outbreak of the Suez incident." "Süddeutsche Zeitung" said: "The movement of the people of former dependent countries to liberate themselves from the protection of great powers can no longer be stopped. Regardless of how things develop, the people of these countries will eventually form a force that Western governments must take seriously."

"Frankfurter Rundschau" pointed out that the West is unwilling to face the truth. It said: "The future belongs to nationalist and socialist revolutionary movements, not to oil tycoons."

"Die Welt" believes that now is the time for the West to "honestly and unreservedly" recognize the trend of the Arab world towards independence. "Lloyd and Dulles have already been defeated in a decisive battle."

    开罗报纸斥英国侵略约旦
    指出这是一次愚蠢的行动
    开罗重要的阿拉伯文报纸18日都发表社论，谴责英国对约旦的侵略。这些报纸一致相信，英国的占领行为只是英美进攻伊拉克阴谋的另一环节。
    “共和国报”说，帝国主义侵略行动的目的，是要打击阿拉伯的民族主义。
    “消息报”认为英国的行动是“又一次愚蠢的行动”，这种行动已经使全世界向着爆发战争又前进了一步。
    “金字塔报”说，英国又回到约旦去保护英国的利益和领地，这种领地将会又一次被利用来为进攻中东各国的帝国主义的基地和跳板。
    印报抨击美国海盗行为
    认为这是对亚非人民挑战
    印度“国民先驱报”18日的社论支持苏联在安理会提出的要求美国停止对中东的武装干涉的提案。社论说：“苏联把美国的这种行动叫做侵略行动是完全正确的，苏联的提案正确地叙述了事实”。这家报纸又说，美国“企图扭转历史，它将遭到惨败”。
    “甘露市场报”反驳了美国总统艾森豪威尔和美国驻联合国代表洛奇为侵略黎巴嫩制造的借口，说他们的论点“掩盖不了美国在黎巴嫩的不正当的武装干涉的丑恶事实。”
    保守的“印度时报”在社论中也说，美国和英国在中近东的侵略行动是“赌博”，“从法律和道义观点来看，干涉行动是完全无法辩解的。”
    “闪电”周报的社论说：“美国大举干涉黎巴嫩内政是赤裸裸的海盗行为。”社论说，美国的侵略是对亚非人民的万隆精神和对这两个古老大陆的自由和前途的挑战。社论说，亚非各国人民将要接受这个挑战并且给予应有的回答。社论还说，“在苏伊士战争时英勇的埃及给予炮舰政策以致命的打击，同样的命运在等待着对黎巴嫩的大举干涉。”
    巴基斯坦报纸
    反对巴总统支持美英侵略
    乌尔都文报纸“今天报”18日写道：“美国和英国在派兵在黎巴嫩、土耳其和约旦登陆以破坏世界和平这件事所表现出来的鲁莽，是根本不应该予以支持的。巴格达条约的三个穆斯林成员国的首脑支持它，那是没有任何为人类服务之处”。
    乌尔都文报纸“战斗报”在18日的社论中说：“巴基斯坦不应该愚蠢地经常支持它的西方盟邦”。
    晚报“领袖报”发表文章说，最近在伊拉克发动的革命又一次明显地说明，傀儡统治者在中东是没有地位的。
    警惕美国在联合国搞新阴谋
    缅报谴责美英肮脏政策
    缅甸有影响的“人民报”18日发表社论，要求全世界人民采取一致行动反对美国对黎巴嫩的侵略行为。社论说，美国军队在黎巴嫩的登陆和美英在地中海的军事活动不仅是对中东国家主权的侵犯，而且也是危及世界和平的罪恶行动。
    缅甸发行量最大的“仰光日报”发表社论，谴责美英在黎巴嫩和约旦采取的军事活动是干涉黎巴嫩、约旦和伊拉克的内政。
    全缅农民协会机关报“联邦报”指出，干涉其它国家内政是美国每当它的走狗被逐出统治地位时所常常奉行的肮脏政策。社论还谴责美国在联合国名义下在朝鲜所采取的侵略军事行动。社论要求各国警惕美国的新阴谋。
    别忘了苏伊士的教训
    英国报纸对政府提出警告
    许多英国资产阶级报纸对美英武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦所将要带来的后果表示不安。
    “新闻纪事报”在19日写道，归根结蒂，英美的行动只会使他们想要镇压的力量变得更加壮大。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”认为，英国干涉阿拉伯各国人民的事务是一个“错误”，是粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章。这家报纸写道，一个外国干涉另一个国家的事务，“即使是应另一个国家的请求也是非法的”。报纸说，每个国家的人民都享有决定本国政治制度的不可剥夺的权利，“假如人家喜欢采取革命的方法，任何其他国家都无权反对这样做”。
    “每日镜报”在社论中指责英国政府不接受苏伊士冒险的教训。报纸写道，“苏伊士事件在历史上是一个很大的错误。而英国军队在约旦的登陆甚至包含着更大的危险。”
    工党议员克罗斯曼在这家报纸上撰写的文章中也认为：“这次的英美赌博甚至比两年以前的英法赌博还要更为轻率”。他表示担心这次冒险“将会给我们带来更大的灾难”。他呼吁，“必需在局势还没有到不可收拾的地步的时候召开东西方高级会议”。
    “每日先驱报”也表示反对武装干涉而要求苏联和西方国家召开高级会议来解决中东的冲突。
    “金融时报”在社论中对于“依靠西方的军事力量来保证中东经常的稳定”的可能性表示怀疑。
    西德报纸评中东局势
    未来不是属于石油大王的
    西德一些报纸认为阿拉伯团结的道路是阻塞不了的。“法兰克福汇报”在17日的评论中写道：美国的这种行动给世界和平造成了“比苏伊士事件爆发以后更为急迫的”危险。“南德意志报”说：“前附属国人民争取从大国保护下解放出来的运动再也阻止不了了。不管事态发展如何，这些国家的人民最后将形成西方政府必须重视的力量。”
    “法兰克福评论报”指出西方不愿意正视真理。它说：“未来是属于民族主义和社会主义革命运动的，而不是属于石油大王的。”
    “世界报”认为，现在是西方“老老实实和毫无保留”地认识阿拉伯走向独立的趋势的时候了。“劳埃德和杜勒斯已经在一场决定性的战斗中打了败仗。”
