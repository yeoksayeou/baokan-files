    The Beautiful and Rich Danube Delta
    The blue Danube River, converging countless tributaries from seven countries, rushes through 2,900 kilometers of Europe, and finally injects its huge volume of water into the Black Sea in Romania. At its estuary, it divides into three branches, and the areas between the branches all have their own names: Chilia, Sulina, and Sfântu Gheorghe. The beautiful and rich Danube Delta in Romania is a well-known good place in Europe.
    From one end of the delta to the other stretches an endless expanse of reeds, covering an area of 260,000 hectares, making it the largest reed area in the world. Romania produces one-third of the world's reeds, and the reason lies here. The Danube Delta has countless canals and waterways that run through the reed beds. When passing through here by boat, you inevitably brush gently against the dense plant walls before entering the mysterious lakes and ponds covered with water lilies, where the scenery is completely different. These rivers and lakes connect the delta's villages, fishing grounds, farmland, vegetable gardens, vineyards, and livestock farms, making it a huge land-water maze.
    On the sparkling water surface, there are wild ducks, geese, swans in pairs, beautiful egrets, crimson flamingos, and long-beaked black pelicans everywhere. In the reed beds, the sound of birds is noisy. Sometimes, the sound of oars rowing or a clear gunshot will startle countless flying birds. The flocks of birds fly from the reed beds into the high sky, looking like clouds covering the sky. No wonder the delta has another nickname: "Paradise for Birds."
    Countless swamps and the Danube River in the delta are also home to a wide variety of fish: perch, carp, pike, sturgeon, etc. The fish produced in the delta accounts for more than half of Romania's total output.
    As for the delta's greatest asset—reeds—it was only after the people took control of the government that the opportunity to put them to use arose. Now, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Romania have jointly formed a "Reed Utilization Committee" to decide to turn the reeds into pulp and textile fibers. The charming delta not only attracts fishermen, hunters, and people who appreciate the scenery, but also attracts a large number of production workers.

    美丽而富饶的多瑙河三角洲
    蓝色的多瑙河，汇合了来自七个国家的无数支流，奔驰过欧洲两千九百公里的路程，最后在罗马尼亚把巨大的水量注入黑海。它在入海处分为三个支流，支流之间的地方都有自己的名字：基里亚、苏利那和圣格奥尔基。罗马尼亚的美丽而富饶的多瑙河三角洲，是欧洲有名的好地方。
    三角洲的一端到另一端，伸展着无边无际的芦苇丛，面积达二十六万公顷，是举世无双的最大芦苇区。罗马尼亚出产了全世界三分之一的芦苇，原因就在这里。多瑙河三角洲有无数的运河和水道，它们贯穿在芦苇丛间，乘船经过这里时，免不了要轻轻地擦过这茂密的植物墙垣，然后才能进入复盖着睡莲的神秘的湖泊和池塘，那里另是一番风光。这些河道和湖泊把三角洲的村庄、渔场、农田、菜园、葡萄园和饲畜场联接起来，简直是一个巨大的水陆迷宫。
    在波光点点的水面上，到处都是野鸭、雁、成双的天鹅、美丽的白鹭、紫红色的红鹤和长嘴巴的黑鹈鹕。芦苇丛中，鸟语声喧。有时，船桨的划动声或者一响清脆的猎枪声，就会惊起无数的飞鸟，鸟群从芦苇丛中飞入高空，简直像是遮天的乌云。怪不得三角洲还有另外一个绰号：“鸟儿的天堂”。
    三角洲无数的沼泽里和多瑙河里还栖息着种类繁多的鱼群：鲈鱼、鲤鱼、梭鱼、大鲟鱼等。三角洲出产的鱼占罗马尼亚总产量的一半以上。
    至于三角洲上最大的财产——芦苇，是在人民掌握了政权后，才得到发挥作用的机会的。现在，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国和罗马尼亚一道组成了“芦苇利用委员会”，决定把芦苇造成纸浆和纺织用的纤维。景色迷人的三角洲如今不仅吸引着渔夫、猎人和欣赏美景的人们，还吸引着大批生产工人。
