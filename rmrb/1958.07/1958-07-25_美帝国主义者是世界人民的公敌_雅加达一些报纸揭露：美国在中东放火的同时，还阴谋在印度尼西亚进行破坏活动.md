Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 21st – Some newspapers in Jakarta pointed out that while the mass movement of the Indonesian people against the US invasion of Middle Eastern countries is rising, attention should also be paid to the US conspiracy to carry out sabotage activities in Indonesia.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" pointed out that some US oil companies in Indonesia, such as Texaco, have recently announced the amount of foreign exchange that this company has "already given" to Indonesia in recent years. The "People's Daily" said that this "polite violence" by the United States is actually a request to the Indonesian government to prohibit Indonesian workers in these American enterprises from taking action against these enterprises.

The "Youth Daily" said that in addition to paying attention to the activities of the US Sixth Fleet threatening Middle Eastern countries, we must also be vigilant about the activities of the Seventh Fleet surrounding certain Pacific countries. The newspaper pointed out that when the situation in the Middle East is becoming increasingly tense, activities to conspire to encircle Indonesia are being prepared. Therefore, it pointed out that in addition to taking a clearer and more active attitude towards the Middle East situation, a clearer and more active attitude must also be taken towards the situation in Indonesia and its surrounding areas.

    雅加达一些报纸揭露：美国在中东放火的同时，还阴谋在印度尼西亚进行破坏活动
    新华社雅加达21日电　雅加达的一些报纸指出，在印度尼西亚人民反对美国侵略中东国家的群众运动日益高涨的时候，应该同时注意美国对印度尼西亚进行破坏活动的阴谋。
    雅加达“人民日报”指出，美国在印度尼西亚的一些石油公司，如德士古石油公司，最近突然公布了这家公司在近年来“已经给予”印度尼西亚的外汇的数字。“人民日报”说，美国的这种“有礼貌的暴行”实际上是要求印度尼西亚政府禁止这里的美国企业中的印度尼西亚工人对这些企业采取行动。
    “青年报”说，我们除了要注意美国第六舰队威胁中东国家的活动以外，还必须警惕包围着某些太平洋国家的第七舰队的活动。这家报纸指出，当中东局势日益紧张的时候，阴谋包围印度尼西亚的活动正在准备中。因此，它指出，除了要对中东局势采取更明确和更积极的态度之外，对印度尼西亚国内的和周围地区的局势也必须采取更明确和更积极的态度。
