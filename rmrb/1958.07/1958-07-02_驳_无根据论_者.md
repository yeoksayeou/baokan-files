Refuting the "No Basis" Theorists
    Zhou Chiguang

    During the Great Leap Forward in Culture, a department head of a certain university proposed a plan to catch up with the world's highest level in scientific research after five years of hard work. This was an inspiring plan, and therefore won the warm support of the vast majority of teachers and students in the department. However, there were also a very few teachers who, with skeptical eyes, criticized it. They said:

    "No investigation or research, no basis at all. Do you know how high the world level is? Don't be blindly optimistic!" Behind their backs they said: "The higher the tone, the better; the more applause, the better. Encouraging others to sing high-pitched songs is not for realization, but for sounding good."

    These people are born dwarfs. They do not believe that under the illumination of the general line, we can catch up with and surpass the world's highest level in scientific research. They don't believe it, and they can only be that way, but they still want to point fingers, pour cold water, and deflate the atmosphere.

    Is it really "no basis"? This reminds us of a saying by Shanghai workers. According to reports, when the Shanghai Huafu Gold Pen Factory proposed the slogan of catching up with the American Parker pen with its Hero pen, a reporter from Reuters in the United Kingdom rushed to the factory and questioned in a contemptuous tone: "What conditions do you have to catch up with Parker?" The factory's employees answered well: "Rely on our own hands!"

    "No Basis" theory, like "No Condition" theory, are stumbling blocks placed in our way forward by some people. We must crush them in order to move forward better. The answer of Shanghai employees, "rely on ourselves," is our basis and condition.

    The scientific research mentioned above by that university falls within the scope of social sciences. One of their bases is daring to raise the red flag of revolution in the world. They want to take Marxism-Leninism as a guide, and the thoughts and writings of Comrade Mao Zedong as the key, to summarize the rich experience of our country's revolution and socialist construction, criticize revisionist and bourgeois academic thoughts, and promote and develop Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences. And those "no basis" theorists are precisely those who dare not raise the red flag of revolution.

    The second basis lies in their seeing the human factor. They believe in the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. And those "no basis" theorists just see the dead factors of "basis" and "conditions"; they do not see the human factor after breaking superstitions and liberating their minds. The reason they cannot see the human factor is that their own minds have not yet been liberated. Therefore, they make comments and want to use all kinds of rules and regulations to bind people's hands and feet.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Introducing a Cooperative": "It may not take as long as we used to think for our country to catch up with the major capitalist countries in industrial and agricultural production. In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people is a decisive factor."

    People are the decisive factor. This truth has not yet been universally grasped by all of us.

    Because there is Comrade Zhang Runhuai, the county party secretary of Yu County, Shanxi Province, who dares to act, this breaks the superstition that a county cannot build railways. It can also rely on the masses to build the first county-run railway in the country in Yu County. Did Comrade Zhang Runhuai need any "basis"?

    Because there are people like Li Chunhe, Li Jianmin, Li Jicheng, and Li Xinmin from Zhuotou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Anguo County, Hebei Province, this broke the superstition that wheat cannot produce high yields. They created a high yield record of 5,103 catties of wheat per mu. Did they need any "conditions"?

    However, the "people" here do not refer to the kind of "Jia Gui whose head is still full of all kinds of superstitions, fears, and inferiority complexes." Relying on them, we cannot only not catch up with the world's advanced level in scientific research, but also not catch up with the major capitalist countries in industrial and agricultural production. No, we don't rely on such people. We rely on another new type of people, people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act.

    "No Basis" theorists are clear enough to see the tip of an autumn hair, but they do not see a cartload of firewood. Unfortunately, they can only see the "tip of an autumn hair." How can they understand the great power of people?

    驳“无根据论”者
    周赤光
    某大学的一个系主任，在文化大跃进中，提出苦战五年，要在科学研究上赶上世界水平最高峰的规划。这是一个鼓舞人心的规划，因而获得全系绝大多数师生热烈的拥护。可是，也有极少数的教师，抱着怀疑的眼光，对它加以非议。他们说：
    “没调查研究，毫无根据，你知道世界水平，有多高吗？别盲目乐观了吧！”背后又说：“调子越高越好，掌声越多越好。鼓励别人唱高调，不是为了实现，而是为了好听。”
    这些人是天生的侏儒。他们不相信在总路线的照耀下，我们是能够在科学研究上赶上并超过世界最高水平的。他们不相信，也只好由他们，可是他们还要指手划脚，给人泼冷水，泄大气。
    真是“毫无根据”吗？这使我们想起了上海工人的一句话。据报载，当上海华孚金笔厂提出：要使英雄金笔赶上美国派克的口号时，英国路透社记者急急忙忙地赶到这个工厂，以轻蔑的口吻质问道：“你们以什么条件赶上派克？”这个厂的职工回答得好：“靠我们自己双手！”
    “无根据论”和“无条件论”一样，都是一些人强加在我们前进道上的绊脚石。必须粉碎它们，才能更好地前进。上海职工的答案“靠我们自己”，这就是我们的根据和条件。
    上面说的那个大学提出的科学研究，属于社会科学的范围。他们的根据之一，就是敢于在世界上插起革命的红旗。他们要以马克思列宁主义为指导，以毛泽东同志的思想和著作为纲，总结我国革命和社会主义建设的丰富经验，批判修正主义和资产阶级的学术思想，推进和发展马克思列宁主义的哲学和社会科学。而那些“无根据论”者，却正是不敢打起革命的红旗的人。
    根据之二，就在于他们看见了人的因素。他们相信群众的积极性和创造性。而那些“无根据论”者，却恰恰只看见“根据”和“条件”这些死的因素；看不见破除迷信解放思想以后的人的因素。他们看不见人的因素的原因，正是他们自己的思想还没有解放。因此他们评头论足，想用种种清规戒律来束缚人们的手足。
    毛泽东同志在“介绍一个合作社”的文章中说：“我国在工农业生产方面赶上资本主义大国，可能不需要从前所想的那样长的时间了。除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。”
    人是决定的因素。这个真理，还没有普遍被我们所有的人所掌握。
    因为有了山西盂县县委书记张润槐同志这样敢干的人，这就打破了一个县不能办铁路的迷信。也就能依靠群众，在盂县办起了全国第一条县办的铁路。张润槐同志要过什么“根据”吗？
    因为有了河北安国县卓头村农业社李春合、李建民、李继承、李新民等这样的人，这就打破了小麦不能高产的迷信。他们创造了亩产小麦五千一百零三斤的高产纪录。他们要过什么“条件”吗？
    但是，这里的“人”，不是指的那种“头脑里还装满了种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感”的贾桂。依靠他们，我们不仅不能在科学研究上赶上世界先进的水平，并且也不能在工农业生产上，赶上资本主义大国。不，我们不依靠这种人。我们依靠的是另外一种新型的人，敢想敢说敢做的人。
    “无根据论”者明足以察秋毫之末，而不见舆薪。可惜他们也只能看到“秋毫之末”而已，这又怎么能懂得人的伟大力量呢？
