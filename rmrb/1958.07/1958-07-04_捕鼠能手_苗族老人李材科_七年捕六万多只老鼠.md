    Rat-Catching Expert
    Miao Elder Li Caike
    Catches Over 60,000 Rats in Seven Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 3rd – Li Caike, a 67-year-old Miao elder, possesses extensive knowledge of rat habits and activity patterns. Since the latter half of 1951, he has vigorously engaged in rat extermination work, eliminating over 65,000 rats in seven years, averaging 25 rats per day.
    Li Caike is a member of the Songpo Agricultural Cooperative in Yongping County, Yunnan Province, and also a Miao folk doctor. The agricultural cooperative assigned him to raise pigs, and he used his spare time to exterminate rats. Every day when he went out, he always carried two or three hundred rat-catching tools, set them in the evening, and collected them the next morning, catching twenty or thirty rats each time.
    Through long-term practice, and addressing various different situations, he has successively created more than ten kinds of light and economical rat-catching tools such as buckles, crossbows, and snares, and also concocted rat poison with medicinal herbs. He can accurately judge the location of rat holes and the condition of rats inside based on some subtle signs, either by digging, placing tools, or applying poison. No matter how cunning the rats are, they cannot escape his grasp.

    苗族老人李材科
    七年捕六万多只老鼠
    新华社昆明3日电　六十七岁的苗族老人李材科，对老鼠的习性和活动规律具有丰富的知识，他从1951年下半年起大力从事灭鼠工作，七年来共灭鼠六万五千多只，平均每天灭鼠二十五只。
    李材科是云南省永平县松坡农业社的社员，也是一个苗族民间医生。农业社分配他放猪，他就利用劳动之余来灭鼠。每天出外，他总是带着两三百件捕鼠工具，晚上放，第二天早上收，每次都要捉二、三十只。
    在长期的实践中，针对着各种不同的情况，他先后创造了扣子、弩子、浏子等十多种轻巧而省钱的捕鼠工具，并且用药草配制了毒鼠药。他能根据一些细微的迹象，准确地判断鼠洞和洞内老鼠的情况，或挖掘，或放工具，或施毒药，不论老鼠多么狡猾，都跑不出他的手。
