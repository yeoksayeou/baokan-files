Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 17th: The First Production Team of the Lianban Agricultural Cooperative in Chengmen Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, harvested 11,961.7 jin of dried grain from a 2.06 mu experimental field of early rice, averaging 5,806.85 jin per mu. This is 4,890+ jin higher than the 900+ jin per mu from the same field’s two harvests last year, equaling five years' worth of harvest in one season.

The experimenters of this high-yield field were Lin Likai, the captain of the cooperative's First Production Team, Vice-Captain Huang Yidan, technician Huang Yunkai, and the cooperative members. Huang Baoluo, the head of the Lianban Cooperative and a renowned model worker, participated in the research and provided strong support.

On the 15th, when the harvest took place, Ye Fei, First Secretary and Governor of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, came to offer his congratulations and participated in the threshing, weighing, and supervision of the harvest. Also participating in the harvest and supervision were Wei Jinshui, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Vice Governors Chen Shaokuan and Liang Lingguang, and Xu Lijin, Secretary of the Minhou County Party Committee. Vice Governor Xu Ya, member of the Provincial Party Committee Wen Fushan, and others personally measured the land area. More than forty members from other production teams also came to participate in the harvest and supervision. Everyone praised the rice for growing well, with thick stalks, large ears, and full grains. The harvested rice could not fit in the field and had to be stacked in layers. Many cooperative members used to be skilled porters, able to carry more than forty bundles at a time, but this time, due to the thick stalks and heavy grains, they could only carry up to twenty-four bundles. The cooperative members said: In the past, rice stalks grew like lamp wicks, with short ears and sparse grains, and they couldn't even harvest a few dan of grain, making the harvest increasingly disappointing. This year, the rice grows like orchids in full bloom, making the harvest more and more energetic. Ye Fei, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, who swung the heavy rice bundles with everyone, repeatedly praised: "Good ears!" He congratulated Lin Likai and others for launching this big "satellite" and encouraged them to create an even bigger "satellite" in the late season.

The creators of the high yield introduced their experiences in achieving high yields to the provincial and county leaders and other production teams on the spot. This field adopted direct seeding in rows with dense planting, averaging nearly 40 jin of "Nante No." seeds per mu, more than twice as dense as transplanting 30,000 seedlings per mu. As a result, there was less tillering, and the vast majority were mother ears with large ears and full grains. Among the average of 900,000 ears per mu, 700,000 were mother ears, with each mother ear producing 130 grains. The soil was deeply plowed to more than eight inches (three to four inches deeper than in the past). During deep plowing, pond mud, mountain grass fertilizer, human manure, pig manure, wood ash, and sea fertilizer were applied in three layers as base fertilizer, totaling more than 4,000 dan. During the seedling growth period, 30 jin of chemical fertilizer were also applied as top dressing. Timely shallow and frequent irrigation was carried out to maintain the water depth at about one fen, increasing the soil temperature. The field was baked six times and insecticide was applied three times, preventing blight and white ears. During flowering and heading, bamboo poles and ropes were used to tie up the rice in a timely manner, preventing early lodging.

The Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the Fujian Provincial People's Committee have awarded the Lianban Cooperative a tractor for this achievement.

(Editor's Note: On the 9th, this newspaper published a report on the Lianban Cooperative's high yield record of 3,054 jin per mu of early rice.)

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 17th: In Jiangxi Province, 1.395 mu of early rice has broken through the average yield of 4,000 jin per mu.

This early rice field is a high-yield experimental field jointly managed by Cheng Xuwu, Deputy Secretary of the Miaqian Township Party Committee in Poyang County, and technicians and members of the Hongcao Agricultural Cooperative. The harvested early rice, after being dried and cleaned, yielded a total of 5,703.5 jin of dried grain, averaging 4,088.3 jin per mu. During the harvest process, an eight-person team composed of cadres from the township, cooperative, and neighboring cooperatives conducted an on-site inspection. Ge Fengxiang, Secretary of the Poyang County Party Committee, Cao Yulong, Deputy Secretary, and the Poyang Inspection Team of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's Agricultural Inspection Group conducted a re-examination and land measurement. It was proven that the above-mentioned yield and land area are completely accurate.

The Hongcao Cooperative is located on the shore of Poyang Lake, and this field has alluvial soil, good sunlight, and sufficient water, but last year's early rice yield was only more than 682 jin per mu. This year, after designating it as an experimental field, they boldly promoted intensive multiple planting of early rice. In coordination with this measure, they deeply plowed the land and applied fertilizer in layers, applying more than 2,400 dan of base fertilizer per mu. Later, according to the growth of the seedlings, they applied six top dressings. Therefore, the early rice not only had many tillers and ears, with an average of fifteen ears per tiller, but also grew particularly strong, with stalks as tall as a person and full grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 16th: The First Production Team of the Shuanglong Cooperative in Pingzhen Township, Lichuan County, Hubei Province, produced 49,725 jin of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) on 1.3 mu of land, averaging 38,250 jin per mu. This high-yield record is 20,510 jin more than the highest record of 17,740 jin per mu achieved by the Jingjiaba Agricultural Cooperative in Wen County, Gansu in 1957.

The creator of this record is the Youth Shock Brigade of the Shuanglong Cooperative's First Team. The captain of the Youth Shock Brigade, Communist Youth League member Qin Taihe, and all the team members demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and actively adopted a series of advanced production-increasing measures. They planted "Soviet Red" potatoes and implemented intensive planting, with a base fertilizer of 70 loads of liquid manure, 103 loads of cow manure, and 50 loads of ash per mu, with two top dressings. In the early stage of potato growth, they sprayed pesticides to prevent late blight and timely removed the potato flowers.

The yield was verified by the Enshi Prefectural Commissioner's Office inspection team, including Li Chenglu, Chen Quantong, Wang Wenxue, Li Yongsong, Tan Shibin, and Lu Yongzhen from the Jiannan Agricultural Technology Station, confirming the accuracy of the yield.

    连坂社再创高产新纪录
    早稻亩产五千八百多斤
    双龙社马铃薯获得高产，亩产三万八千二百五十斤
    新华社福州17日电　福建省闽侯县城门乡连坂农业社第一生产队有一丘二亩零六厘的早稻试验田，共收获干谷一万一千九百六十一斤七两，平均每亩收五千八百零六斤八两五钱。这比去年这丘田早晚两季亩产九百多斤高出四千八百九十多斤，一季顶五年收成。
    这丘丰产田的试验者是这个社第一生产队的队长林立开、副队长黄伊淡、技术员黄云开和社员们。连坂社社长、著名劳动模范黄宝洛参加研究，并给予大力支持。
    15日收割时，中共福建省委第一书记、省长叶飞特前来祝贺，并参加了打谷过秤和监收。参加收割和监收的还有省委书记魏金水，副省长陈绍宽、梁灵光，中共闽侯县委书记许力进。副省长许亚、省委委员温附山等人亲自丈量了土地面积。其他生产队的社员有四十多人也前来参加收割和监收。大家连连称赞这丘稻子长得好，秆粗穗大，谷粒饱满。割下的稻子田里放不下，只好一层层叠起来。许多社员过去是肩挑能手，一次就能挑四十多束，这次由于秆粗谷重，最多只能挑起二十四束。社员们说：过去稻秆长得像灯芯草，穗短粒稀，打不到几担谷子，真是越割越扫兴。今年稻子长得好像满园盛开的兰花，越割越有劲。同大家一起挥起沉甸甸的稻把摔打的省委第一书记叶飞，再三称赞：“好穗子”，他祝贺林立开等人放出了这颗大“卫星”，并且勉励他们晚季创造更大的“卫星”。
    丰产创造者当场向省、县负责同志和别的生产队介绍了他们获得高额丰产的经验。这丘田是采用直播条播密植，平均每亩播“南特号”种近四十斤，比用插秧亩插三万丛密两倍多。这样，发蔸少，绝大多数都是穗大粒饱的母穗，平均每亩九十万穗中，母穗就有七十万穗，每个母穗结谷达一百三十粒。深翻土八寸多（比过去深三寸到四寸）。在深翻土时分三层施下池塘肥、山皮草肥、人粪、猪粪、草木灰和海肥等基肥四千多担。禾苗生长期间，还追施化肥三十斤。适时通过浅水勤灌，使灌水深度经常保持一分上下，增加了地温。烤田六次，除虫三次，没有枯心苗和白穗。扬花抽穗时，又适时用竹杆、绳子把稻子缚好，没有发生早期倒伏。
    中共福建省委和福建省人民委员会已为此奖给连坂社一部拖拉机。
    （编者注：9日本报一版曾发表连坂社早稻亩产三千零五十四斤的高产纪录）
    据新华社南昌17日电　江西省有一点三九五亩早稻突破了平均亩产四千斤的大关。
    这块早稻田是鄱阳县庙前乡党委副书记程序梧与洪曹农业社技术员、社员共同搞的丰产试验田。它收获的早稻晒干、扬净后，共收干谷五千七百零三斤五两，平均每亩收干谷四千零八十八斤三两。收获过程中，由本乡、社和邻社干部组成的八人小组曾经进行实地验收。中共波阳县委书记葛凤翔、副书记曹玉龙和中共江西省委农业检查团鄱阳检查组等又进行了复查、丈地。证明上述产量和土地面积完全属实。
    洪曹社位于鄱阳湖滨，这丘田是冲积土壤，阳光好，水源足，但去年早稻亩产只有六百八十二斤多。今年他们确定为试验田后，大胆推行了早稻复式密植。并且配合这一措施，深耕土地，分层施肥，每亩下基肥二千四百多担。后来又根据禾苗生长情况施了六次追肥。因此，早稻不仅兜多穗多，每兜平均有十五个穗子，而且长得格外茁壮，禾秆齐人高，籽粒饱满。
    新华社武汉16日电　湖北利川县平镇乡双龙社第一生产队在一亩三分地里产洋芋（马铃薯）四万九千七百二十五斤，平均亩产三万八千二百五十斤。这一高产纪录，比1957年甘肃文县景家坝农业社亩产一万七千七百四十斤的最高纪录，要多二万零五百一十斤。
    这项纪录的创造者是双龙社一队的青年突击队。青年突击队长、共青团员覃太和和全体队员，发挥了高度的劳动热情，积极采用了一系列的先进增产措施。他们栽了“苏联红”洋芋，并实行密植，底肥每亩水粪七十挑，牛粪一百零三挑，火灰五十挑，追肥两次。他们在洋芋生长早期，喷射了农药，预防了洋芋晚疫病，并适时摘去了洋芋的花朵。
    经恩施专署验收小组黎成禄、陈全统、望文学、李永松、谭世彬和建南农业技术站吕永侦等参加验收，产量属实。
