Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 4th:
Soviet scientist Chizhevsky has discovered the mathematical equation for the movement of red blood cells along blood vessels. People can use this equation to diagnose cancer as soon as it begins, in order to treat it early.

This is the conclusion drawn in Chizhevsky's book "Research on the Structural Analysis of Flowing Blood," recently published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. As everyone knows, the cause of cancer is still a matter of debate. Late treatment of this disease is often ineffective, and even life cannot be saved.

Chizhevsky determined that blood cells are not in a chaotic state in the blood, but are arranged according to a strict system. He discovered the mathematical equation that shows the movement of red blood cells along blood vessels. Healthy people have a certain number of red blood cells in their blood, and they also have the most reasonable distribution in space. If the body is ill, this system will be destroyed, and the number of red blood cells per unit volume will be reduced. A blood structure formula, experimentally proven at the Karaganda Tumor Prevention and Treatment Institute, can enable people to diagnose cancer at its earliest stage.

    苏联科学家说
    利用血液结构公式能够及早诊断癌症
    据新华社莫斯科4日电  苏联著名科学家奇日夫斯基发现红血球沿血管运动的数学方程式。人们运用这种方程式可以在癌症刚开始发生时就把它诊断出来，以便及早治疗。
    这是苏联科学院新近出版的奇日夫斯基的“流动血液结构分析研究”一书中得出的结论。大家知道，癌症发生的原因目前还是一个争论的问题，这种病治疗太晚往往效果不好，乃至生命无法挽救。
    奇日夫斯基确定，血球在血中不是处于杂乱无章的状态，而是按照严格的体系排列的。他发现了表明红血球沿血管运动的数学方程式。健康人的血液中红血球有一定的数量，在空间上也有最合理的分布。机体患病就会破坏这一体系，使单位体积内的红血球数目减少。在卡拉干达肿瘤防治所得到实验证明的一个血液结构公式，就可以使人们在最早期诊断癌症。
