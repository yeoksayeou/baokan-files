Shaanxi and Other Provinces Decide to Build Railways by the Whole People
    New Line Earthwork Engineering Contracted by Farmers Along the Route

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 24th dispatch) The Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently proposed a method of mobilizing the whole people to build railways, which has been agreed to by the party and government leading organs of Henan, Qinghai, Shaanxi and other provinces. This provides a new direction for developing railway construction undertakings in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways undertook the construction tasks of all railway construction projects in Shaanxi and Qinghai, and some new line projects in Henan and Gansu provinces. The amount of work is even greater than the total number of newly built railways actually completed nationwide during the First Five-Year Plan period. According to the existing strength of this bureau, it is difficult to complete such a large task. After studying this situation, the leaders of the Sixth Engineering Bureau believed that earthwork engineering generally accounts for about 70% of the total workload in railway construction, which is of great importance to completing the task of new line construction. The technical requirements for earthwork engineering are not very high, and ordinary workers and farmers can complete it with a little guidance. Therefore, they proposed the method of running railways by the whole people.

    Running railways by the whole people means that the local party committees or administrative leaders take charge, mobilizing the masses along the route to participate in railway construction during the slack farming season. The specific method is: the counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives along the new railway line are responsible for completing the earthwork engineering of the new railway through a contract system; the engineering bureau sends foremen and technicians to provide technical guidance. The employees of the engineering bureau are only responsible for track laying, spiking, and the construction of bridges, tunnels, culverts, and stations, which require higher technical skills. By adopting this method, the projects undertaken by the Sixth Engineering Bureau can not only be completed in full, but may also be completed ahead of schedule.

    There are many benefits to building railways by the whole people: First, it can greatly accelerate the construction speed. In the past, railway construction relied on a limited number of railway employees to carry out construction in sections, which was slow; now, the earthwork engineering is contracted by the masses along the route, so construction can start universally along the entire line. According to the person in charge of the Sixth Engineering Bureau, they originally planned to build the railway from Xi'an to Houma in more than two to three years; by mobilizing the masses along the entire line to participate in construction, it can be completed in one year. Second, mobilizing the masses along the route to participate in railway construction during the slack farming season can not only solve the problem of insufficient labor in the railway department, but also not affect agricultural production, and can also increase the income of agricultural cooperatives. Third, relying on the masses along the route to build railways, the accommodation, supply of daily necessities, and some construction tools (such as picks, shovels, etc.) of the road builders can be solved by themselves, which can save a large amount of funds compared with recruiting temporary workers. Fourth, after the earthwork engineering on the railway is contracted by the masses, the masses can build culverts according to the needs of their own water conservancy projects, which can eliminate the contradiction between railway construction and water conservancy projects. Fifth, the masses build earthwork engineering under the guidance of technical cadres of the railway department, which will not only not reduce the quality, but also the foundation can be further consolidated after a large number of roadbeds are washed by rain, grown with grass, and exposed to the sun before laying the track. In addition, the masses along the route will cherish the railways they have built with their own hands even more.

    Now, Henan Province has established a general headquarters for new railway line construction, with a provincial governor serving as the commander-in-chief; special zones have also established sub-headquarters to uniformly lead this work. Qinghai Province has decided to mobilize 50,000 laborers during the slack farming season to work hard throughout the winter.

    At present, the Sixth Engineering Bureau has begun to conduct on-site surveys for new railway construction. At the same time, it is recommended that each county convene meetings of cadres from districts, townships, and cooperatives along the route to conduct short-term technical training for cadres. In addition, they also plan to conduct on-site practice training for the masses participating in road construction before the start of construction. (Zhu Bo, Li Qian)

### 陕西等省决定全民修铁路  新线土石方工程由沿线农民承包

    陕西等省决定全民修铁路
    新线土石方工程由沿线农民承包
    本报西安24日电　铁道部第六工程局最近提出发动全民建设铁路的办法，河南、青海、陕西等省党政领导机关已经同意。这为多快好省地发展铁路建设事业提供了新的方向。
    第二个五年计划期间，铁道部第六工程局担负着陕西、青海境内全部铁路建设工程和河南、甘肃两省部分新线工程的建设任务。工程量比第一个五年计划期间全国实际完成的新建铁路总数还要大；按照这个局现有的力量，完成这样大的任务是有困难的。第六工程局的领导人员研究了这一情况以后认为：修筑铁路过程中，土石方工程量一般要占总工程量的70％左右，对完成新线建设任务关系很大。而土石方工程的技术要求并不很高，只要稍加指导，普通工人和农民都能完成。他们于是提出了全民办铁路的办法。
    全民办铁路，就是由地方党委或行政领导人员挂帅，发动沿线群众，利用农闲时间参加铁路建设。具体办法是：新建铁路沿线的县、区、乡和农业社，采取包干的办法，负责完成新建铁路的土石方工程；工程局派工长、技术人员进行技术指导。工程局职工只担负铺轨、钉道和修建桥梁、隧道、涵管和车站等技术要求较高的工程任务。采取这一办法，第六工程局担负的工程，不但可以全部完成，而且可能提前完工。
    全民建设铁路的好处很多：第一，可以大大加快建设速度。以往修建铁路，都是依靠有限的铁路员工分段施工，进度较慢；现在，土石方工程由沿线群众承包，就可以全线普遍动工。据第六工程局负责人谈，他们修建西安至侯马的铁路，原计划两年多到三年建成；发动全线群众参加建设，一年就可以建成。第二，发动沿线群众利用农闲时间参加铁路建设，既可以解决铁路部门劳动力不足的问题，又不影响农业生产，还可以增加农业社的收入。第三，依靠沿线群众修筑铁路，修路人员的住宿、生活必需品供应，以及部分施工工具（如铁镐、锨等），都可以自行解决，比招收临时工可以节省大批资金。第四，铁路上的土石方工程由群众包修以后，群众可以根据自己水利工程的需要修涵洞，能够消除铁路建设和水利工程的矛盾。第五，群众在铁路部门技术干部指导下修建土石方工程，不仅不会降低质量，而且大批路基经过雨水冲洗、长草和日晒以后再铺轨，基础还可以更加巩固。另外，沿线群众对自己亲手修建的铁路也更加爱护。
    现在，河南省已经成立了铁路新线建设总指挥部，由一位省长担任总指挥；专区还成立了分指挥部，统一领导这一工作。青海省决定利用农闲时间动员五万劳动力，大干一冬。
    目前，第六工程局已经开始进行新建铁路的现场调查工作。同时，建议各县召开沿线区、乡、社干部会议，对干部进行短期的技术训练。另外，他们还准备在开工以前对参加筑路的群众进行现场实习训练。　（朱波、李茜）
