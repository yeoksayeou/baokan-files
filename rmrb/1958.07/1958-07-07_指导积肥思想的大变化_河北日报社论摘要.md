An Important Change in Guiding Ideology for Manure Accumulation
Excerpts from a Hebei Daily Editorial

The Hebei Daily published an editorial on July 3rd discussing the great significance of summer manure accumulation. The editorial stated that the Hebei Provincial Party Committee has put forward the slogan of "Mountain manure down the mountain, water manure up the shore, sea manure landing, soil manure out of the ground, household manure out the door, accumulate three trillion catties of fertilizer before wheat planting, apply 10,000 catties of topdressing per mu for autumn crops, and apply 30,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu for autumn wheat." This slogan is of great significance for the high-speed development of agricultural production in Hebei Province. This is a revolutionary method, a strategic shift in guiding the manure accumulation movement.

Why is this considered a strategic shift? First of all, this method best meets the requirements of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Manure accumulation, like other things, depends on certain conditions. With the same amount of labor, more and better manure can be accumulated when conditions are suitable; when conditions are not suitable, less manure will be accumulated and the quality will be poor. Therefore, it is extremely important to seize certain favorable opportunities to vigorously engage in manure accumulation, and the most favorable time for manure accumulation is summer. Because summer climate promotes fermentation, the speed of manure accumulation is fast, and the quality is relatively high; in summer, weeds are abundant, and there are endless raw materials for manure accumulation.

The editorial said that the facts of increased production over the years tell us that applying more base fertilizer plays an important role in increasing crop production. Because the growth of crops largely depends on the growth status during the seedling stage. Fertile soil and strong seedlings make it easier to achieve increased production; moreover, applying more base fertilizer makes crop stalks strong, which can increase the ability to resist natural disasters and prevent crop lodging. The most important measure to cultivate soil fertility is to apply more base fertilizer. To apply more base fertilizer, the time for large-scale manure accumulation must be greatly advanced, and enough fertilizer must be accumulated in the summer.

It should also be noted that in the past, winter was generally regarded as a season with less agricultural activity, and winter manure accumulation was carried out to make full use of the winter. However, the situation has now undergone major changes. With the development of the production leap forward, the demand for fertilizer has greatly increased, and relying solely on winter manure accumulation is obviously not enough to meet the needs of the leap forward in production. Especially this winter, Hebei Province will carry out an unprecedented campaign to fundamentally control rivers and mountains, and will carry out large-scale land capital construction, such as deep plowing of land, etc. Only by accumulating a large amount of fertilizer in the summer can we ensure that there is sufficient base fertilizer for autumn wheat planting and autumn plowing. Accumulating large amounts of fertilizer in the summer can not only quickly complete the manure accumulation plan, but also make it possible to concentrate efforts on other agricultural construction projects in the winter.

The editorial said that the methods of "several diggings and several cleanings" adopted in the past should continue to be used in the summer manure accumulation movement. More importantly, we must think of more ways to accumulate and create fertilizer. We must seize the current opportunity of high temperature and abundant weeds to vigorously develop green manure; plant green manure crops on reserved wheat fields and idle land. Those near the mountains should collect tree leaves and mineral fertilizer; those near the sea should vigorously develop sea manure; and those near cities can make extensive use of garbage and sewage. Counties, townships, and teams should all vigorously develop self-made chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers. At the same time, in the large-scale summer manure accumulation movement, we must also vigorously grasp pig raising. After the wheat harvest, we should seize the opportunity of no shortage of feed to launch a high tide of pig raising and manure accumulation, and accumulate high-quality and large quantities of fertilizer. In short, we must collect fertilizer sources from all directions, and do everything possible to fully utilize everything that can be used for manure accumulation and fertilizer production, and resolutely obtain three trillion catties of fertilizer.

    指导积肥思想的大变化
    河北日报社论摘要
    7月3日河北日报发表了一篇论述夏季积肥的重大意义的社论。社论说，河北省委提出“山肥下山，水肥上岸，海肥登陆，地肥出土，家肥出门，种麦前积肥三万亿，秋收作物每亩追肥一万斤，秋麦亩施底肥三万斤”的积肥造肥号召，对于高速度地发展河北省的农业生产具有重要的意义。这是一种革命的办法，是指导积肥运动的战略性转变。
    为什么说这是一种战略性转变呢？首先，这种办法最合乎多快好省的要求。积肥像其他事物一样，是依附一定的条件的。花费同样的劳动，在条件适合时就能够多积肥、积好肥；条件不适合就积得少、质量差。所以，选择一定的有利时机大搞积肥极为重要，而积肥最为有利的时机就是夏季。因为夏季气候促进发酵，积肥速度快，而且质量较高；夏季杂草丛生，积肥原料无穷。
    社论说，历年增产的事实告诉我们，多施底肥对于农作物的增产具有重要的作用。因为农作物生长好坏，在很大程度上取决于苗期的生长状况。地力肥沃，苗子茁壮，就易于实现增产；而且，多施底肥，作物秸秆粗壮，能够增加抵抗自然灾害的能力，防止作物的倒伏。培养地力的最为重要的措施就是多施底肥。要多施底肥，就必须把大搞积肥的时间大大提前，在夏季就积够足量的肥料。
  还要看到，过去一般是把冬季看做农事活动较少的季节，开展冬季积肥是为了把冬季充分利用起来。然而，现在情况发生了重大的变化。随着生产跃进的发展，需肥数量大增，只靠冬季积肥，显然是不能满足跃进增产需要的。特别是今年冬季河北省将开展史无前例的根治河山的活动，要大搞土地的基本建设，如深翻土地等等，只有在夏季积造下大量的肥料，才能保证秋后种麦和秋耕有充足的底肥。而在夏季大量积肥，不仅可以迅速完成积肥计划，而且到冬季就有可能集中力量搞其他农业建设事业了。
    社论说，过去所采取的几挖、几净的办法，在夏季积肥运动中应当继续采用，更主要的是多想办法积肥造肥。要抓住目前温度高、杂草多的时机大搞绿肥；在留麦地、闲散地种植绿肥作物。靠山的搂树叶积肥、找矿肥；靠海的大搞海肥；靠近城市可大量利用垃圾、污水。县、乡、社、队都要大搞自制化肥和细菌肥料。同时，在夏季大规模积肥运动中，还要大抓养猪，在麦收后应当抓住饲料不缺的时机，掀起一个养猪积肥的高潮，积攒质好量多的肥料。总之，要四面八方的搜集肥源，千方百计地把一切能用来积肥、造肥的东西完全利用起来，坚决地拿到三万亿斤肥料。
