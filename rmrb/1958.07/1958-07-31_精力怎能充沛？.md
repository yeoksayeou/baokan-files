    How Can One Be Energetic?
    Fang Shu
    Some American newspapers and certain individuals are offering advice to the government regarding participation in the summit conference, spouting a lot of fine words, such as the need to be "energetic," and so on. However, no matter how hard these lackeys try to please their masters, it cannot eliminate their president's feelings of frustration and despair.
    The cunning American imperialists have always been adept at hypocrisy, always releasing smokescreens to cover up their banditry. During the Chinese People's Liberation War, while secretly supplying arms and dollars to the Kuomintang reactionaries, they put on a false face, pretending to be good people and sending figures like Marshall to conduct so-called "mediation." They launched the aggressive war in Korea, but then roped in a dozen or so vassal states and stole the name of the United Nations to whitewash their crimes. And when Britain and France occupied Suez, although they secretly colluded with British and French imperialism, they also publicly gesticulated and "condemned" Britain and France. Only this time, they were driven to desperation, not even having time to brandish the banner of the United Nations, and without even a vote in their own Congress, they stuck out their tongues, bared their bloody mouths, and pounced on Lebanon in their true wolfish colors. Although Eisenhower sang a lullaby to the American troops invading Lebanon, saying that the American invasion of Lebanon was to "help Lebanon maintain its independence" and was "the greatest contribution to world peace," lies cannot cover up facts, and the Lebanese people's great hatred for the American aggressors gave Eisenhower a resounding slap in the face!
    The ugly face of the 20th-century pirate has been completely exposed. In the face of his own crimes, how can he, as his strategists say, "energetically" participate in the summit conference?

    精力怎能充沛？
    方曙
    美国某些报纸和某些人士，正在为政府参加首脑会议这件事设计献策，说了许多漂亮话如什么要“精力充沛”等等。不过尽管这些奴才使尽浑身解数取悦主子，也丝毫不能消除他们总统的懊丧绝望的心情。
    奸狡的美帝国主义者一向惯会惺惺作态，总要施放烟幕弹来掩饰自己的强盗行径。在中国人民解放战争期间，他一面暗中输送军火和美元给国民党反动派；一面却又披上画皮假充好人，派遣马歇尔之流来进行所谓“调停”。他在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，但是却又吆喝了十几个仆从国家，并且盗用联合国的名义来洗刷他的罪行。而在英法侵占苏伊士的时候，他虽然背地里和英法帝国主义者一鼻孔出气，表面上却也在那里指手划脚的“斥责”英法。唯独这一次，他被逼狗急跳墙，来不及打出联合国的招牌，甚至在他本国国会里也没有通过，便吐着舌头，张着血盆大嘴，以恶狼的本来面目扑进黎巴嫩了。虽然艾森豪威尔在对侵黎美军讲话时唱起了迷魂曲，说美国进军黎巴嫩是为了“帮助黎巴嫩维持独立”，是“对世界和平的最大贡献”；但是谎言掩盖不了事实，黎巴嫩人民对于美国侵略军的极大仇恨便给了艾森豪威尔一记狠狠的耳光！
    二十世纪海盗的丑恶面目已经暴露无遗，试问在自己罪证面前，他又如何能像他的谋士们所说的那样，“精力充沛”地去参加首脑会议呢？
