Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 22nd: News received here from Beirut states that American President's special envoy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, made contact with some leaders of the Lebanese opposition on the 21st.

This old-line American conspirator, who arrived in Beirut in the capacity of Eisenhower's "Special Political Representative," has been engaging in tense behind-the-scenes political conspiracy activities for the past few days in order to coordinate with the American military aggression. According to Arab public opinion, Murphy's main goal is to force opposition parties to accept political solutions that conform to American interests, including having the current parliament controlled by the Chamoun clique "elect" a pro-American president on July 24th to replace Chamoun, in order to continue American control over Lebanon while merely changing the label.

According to reports, Murphy attempted to contact on the 21st included National Front leader and former Prime Minister Yafi, Lebanese parties alliance leader Oueini, "Third Force" leader Pharaon, Maronite Archbishop Maouchi, and Tripoli's Maronite Bishop Ubied, among others.

Prior to this, the opposition had expressed opposition to the election of a president by the current parliament, which does not represent the will of the people, and demanded Chamoun's immediate resignation, advocating for a re-election of parliament.

    美国阴谋家墨菲同黎反对派一些领袖接触
    新华社大马士革22日电  据这里收到的贝鲁特消息说，美国总统的特使、副国务卿帮办墨菲在21日同黎巴嫩一些反对党领袖进行了接触。
    这个以艾森豪威尔的“特别政治代表”的身份到贝鲁特的美国老牌阴谋家，几天来一直在进行紧张的幕后政治阴谋活动，以配合美国的军事侵略活动。据阿拉伯舆论揭露，墨菲活动的主要目的是想迫使反对党派接受符合美国利益的政治解决办法，其中包括由夏蒙集团所操纵的现议会在7月24日“选举”出一个亲美的总统来代替夏蒙，以便换汤不换药地继续保持美国对黎巴嫩的控制。
    据报道，墨菲在21日设法接触的有民族阵线领袖、前总理雅非，黎巴嫩各党派联盟领袖乌埃尼、“第三力量”领导人法拉昂、马龙派大主教迈乌什、的黎波里的马龙派主教乌比德等。
    在这以前，反对党曾经表示反对由不代表民意的现议会选举总统，并且要求夏蒙立即辞职，主张重新选举议会。（附图片）
