    "Double Happiness Rice"
    Yuan Xizhi, First Secretary of the CPC Taicang County Committee in Jiangsu Province, discovered five stalks of "Double Happiness Rice" bearing double ears in his 2.73 mu double-cropping early rice experimental plot in Taixing Cooperative, Western Suburb Township. Each ear had sixty to seventy grains. After the Western Suburb Township production inspection team discovered this miracle, they immediately marked it. Many people rushed to this field to visit, and they all said, "This is a happy omen for this year's bumper harvest of early rice."
    This field was sown by Yuan Xizhi under the guidance of local experienced farmers. The original plan was to produce 1,000 jin per mu. According to the current growth, it is estimated that each mu can yield about 1,800 jin, becoming a high-yield banner for double-cropping early rice in this area.

    “双喜稻”
    中共江苏省太仓县委第一书记袁锡志在西郊乡太兴社种的二亩七分三厘的双季稻早稻试验田中，发现有五枝结了双穗的“双喜稻”，每穗有六十粒到七十粒。西郊乡生产检查队发现这一奇迹以后，立即做了标志。许多人赶到这块田来参观，他们都说：“这是今年早稻大丰收的喜兆。”
    这块田是袁锡志在当地老农指导下播种的，原来计划亩产一千斤，根据目前长势，预计每亩可收一千八百斤左右，成为这一地区双季稻早稻高产旗子。
