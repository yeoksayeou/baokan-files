If you want big, full corn ears?
    Please seize the opportunity to implement artificial assisted pollination for corn

Artificial assisted pollination is one of the effective measures to increase corn yield per unit area. According to experiments, research, and production practices in various regions, it can generally increase yield by 7%-10% per mu. If calculated based on an additional 20-30 jin per mu, the nation's 250 million mu of corn could yield over 5 billion jin more grain.

Why does artificial assisted pollination increase corn yield? Corn is a monoecious plant with separate male and female flowers, with the male flowers growing at the top of the stalk and the female flowers growing in the leaf axils halfway up the stalk. The flowering time of the same corn plant is generally three to five days later for the female flowers than the male flowers. During the corn flowering period, adverse weather conditions such as high temperatures, heavy rain, prolonged rain, and strong winds often occur, affecting normal pollination and causing common issues like missing kernels and barren tips, thus reducing yield. Artificial assisted pollination can ensure that pollen from the male flowers is better transferred to the female flowers. At the same time, it allows the corn female flowers to select the most suitable pollen for fertilization when receiving more pollen. Good fertilization of corn female flowers leads to full corn kernels.

Some people believe that implementing artificial assisted pollination for corn is complicated and labor-intensive. In reality, it is not complicated. The specific method for artificial assisted pollination is: use old straw hats, small dustpans, or other utensils (lined with paper) or paper plates to collect male flower pollen. Then, mix the collected pollen together and pour it into the pollinator. Pollinate the silks of each plant. The pollinator is a paper horn (bamboo tube is also fine), with a fine sieve base attached to the tip to allow the pollen to fall through. When pollinating the silks with the pollinator, ensure that the pollen falls evenly on the silks. Pollination should generally be carried out two or three times, with an interval of about three to four days each time. The time for pollination should be chosen on sunny mornings.

Performing artificial assisted pollination for corn generally allows one person to pollinate one or two mu in half a day. If the division of labor is appropriate and the pollination technique is further improved, labor efficiency can be greatly increased. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, used to store pollen in non-heat-conducting containers, dip the pollen with a soft brush or small broom, and pollinate the silks plant by plant, which was twice as efficient as using a pollinator.

    你想叫玉米穗大粒满吗？
    请抓紧时机，实行玉米人工辅助授粉
    人工辅助授粉是提高玉米单位面积产量的有效措施之一。据各地试验研究和生产实践证明，一般每亩可增产7％—10％，如果按每亩可以多收二、三十斤计算，全国二亿五千多万亩玉米，就可以增产粮食五十亿斤以上。
    为什么实行人工辅助授粉能使玉米增产呢？玉米是雌雄同株而异花授粉的作物，雄花生长在茎秆的顶端，雌花生长在半腰的叶腋里。同株玉米的开花时间，雌花一般比雄花迟三至五天。在玉米开花期间，常会遇到一些不良的气候，如气温高、暴雨、霪雨、大风等，以致影响了正常的授粉，造成常见的缺粒、秃尖等情况，降低了产量。人工辅助授粉，就能保证更好地使雄花的花粉授给雌花。同时，它还能使玉米雌花在获得更多的花粉的情况下，选择最适合的来受精。玉米雌花受精好，玉米的籽粒就可以饱满。
    有的人认为实行玉米人工辅助授粉复杂，费工。实际上并不复杂。人工辅助授粉的具体作法是：用旧草帽、小簸箕等用具（里面糊纸）或纸盘来采集雄花花粉，然后把采集的花粉混合起来倒在授粉器中，逐棵地授给花丝。授粉器是用硬纸做成的喇叭筒（竹筒也行），筒的尖端安装可以使花粉漏下的细纱箩底。用授粉器向花丝授粉的时候，要使花粉均匀的落在花丝上面。授粉一般宜进行二、三次，每次约间隔三、四天。授粉的时间应当选择在晴天的上午。
    进行玉米人工辅助授粉，一般每人半天可授粉一、二亩。如果分工适当，再加改进授粉技术，劳动效率还可大大提高。山西省长治专区中苏友好集体农庄曾把花粉盛在不导热的容器内，用软毛刷或小毛帚粘上花粉，按株授给花丝，效率比用授粉器高一倍。（北京日报供稿）
