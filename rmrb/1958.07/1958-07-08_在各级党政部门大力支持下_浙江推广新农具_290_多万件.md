Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 7th: New farm tools have been developed and implemented in Zhejiang Province for various operations, including harrowing, sowing, cultivating, transplanting rice seedlings, transporting, water management, fertilizer accumulation, pest control, water lifting, harvesting, threshing, and feed processing. This is the result of the mass farm tool reform movement vigorously carried out in various places over the past six months.

	These new farm tools, with the exception of a few still under experimentation, have been largely popularized. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2.98 million pieces have been promoted throughout the province. Members of agricultural cooperatives have reported that the new farm tools are not only simple to manufacture, low in cost, and easy to use, but also greatly reduce labor intensity, save labor, and improve the quality of farm work. For example, the hand-cranked mud-kneading machine created in Jiaxing County can knead 1,500 dan of mud per day with two people, which is more than ten times faster than the old mud-kneading frame, while the cost is only more than 100 yuan. According to calculations by relevant departments, the new agricultural tools that have been put into production throughout the province can save 4.5 million to 50 million workdays.

	The creators and improvers of the new agricultural tools are ordinary members of agricultural cooperatives, members of handicraft cooperatives, and some grassroots cadres. Lu Qiaosheng, from Yongxiu Township, Chongde County, who was a beggar child before liberation and never went to school, has continuously created hydraulic waterwheels this year, invented the steam rice seedling cultivation method, and created six-row and five-row strip seeding machines. This type of strip seeding machine is sixty times faster than manual sowing. Yuan Zifu, a nineteen-year-old from Tongxiang County, who was a cowherd for rich peasants before liberation, never went to school and did not understand carpentry. This year, in order to create, he often went to the door of the woodworking cooperative on the street to watch the carpenters operate, secretly learning techniques. He practiced as soon as he came back, often practicing until late at night, often forgetting to eat. He finally developed a good skill, and in the past six months, he has created and imitated seven or eight kinds of advanced tools, such as mud transporters, closed waterwheels, and sowing machines.

	Party and government leading departments at all levels in Zhejiang Province have adopted various methods to vigorously support new creations and quickly promote effective new agricultural tools. Many leading cadres of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, local party committees, and county party committees have either personally gone to the site to support new creations, or taken the lead in researching and experimenting with new agricultural tools, or served as heads of the agricultural tool reform committees. Various localities also continuously hold on-site meetings, new agricultural tool exhibitions, etc., to promote them.

    在各级党政部门大力支持下
    浙江推广新农具290多万件
    新华社杭州7日电  浙江省农村在耙田、播种、中耕、插秧、运输、治水、积肥、治虫、提水、收割、脱粒、饲料加工等操作方面，都已经有了新农具。这是半年来各地大搞群众性农具改革运动的成果。
    这些新农具，除少数正在试验以外，绝大部分已经推广。据初步统计，全省共已推广了二百九十八万多件。农业社社员反映：新农具不但具有制造简单、成本低廉、使用方便等特点，而且能大大减轻劳动强度，节省劳动力，提高农活质量。例如嘉兴县创造的手摇捻泥机，两人一天能捻泥一千五百担，比旧的捻网快十多倍，而造价只一百多元。据有关部门计算，全省推广的新式农具投入生产以后，可以节省四千五百到五千万个工。
    新式农具的创造者和改良者，都是普通的农业社社员、手工业社社员和一部分基层干部。解放前还是个讨饭的孩子、没有读过书的崇德县永秀乡陆巧生，今年连续创造了水力水车，发明了水稻蒸气育秧法，创造了六行和五行条播机，这种条播机比人工播种快六十倍。桐乡县有个十九岁的袁子福，解放前是给富农放牛的小孩，没有读过书，也不懂木匠活，今年为了创造，经常上街到木器社门口看木工操作，偷学技术，回来就练，一练就到深夜，饭也时常忘记吃，终于练出了一手好本领，半年来共创造和仿制了运泥机、封闭式水车、播种机等七、八种先进工具。
    浙江省各级党政领导部门都采用各种办法大力支持新的创造，并且迅速地推广行之有效的新农具。中共浙江省委、各地委和县委的许多负责干部，或亲到现场支持新的创造，或带头研究、试验新农具，或担任农具改革委员会的负责人。各地还不断举行现场会议、新式农具展览会等加以推广。
