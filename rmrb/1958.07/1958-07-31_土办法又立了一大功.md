Indigenous Methods Score Another Major Victory
	Wan Xiangxin
In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, there is also ideological struggle. One of the struggles is to oppose the thinking of trusting "foreign" and not trusting "indigenous," and resolutely implement the policy of "combining indigenous and foreign methods."

Those who trust "foreign" and not "indigenous" fall into several different categories. Some people have not yet cut off the tail of bourgeois ideology and always feel that the creations of the working people are not worth considering; some people's "mental state still carries the imprint of the oppressed, and their minds are filled with all kinds of superstitions, fears, and inferiority complexes"; and some people hope to "reach the sky in one step" and immediately modernize by being divorced from reality. The common characteristic of these people is that they look down on indigenous methods and are therefore unwilling to adopt them.

To correct these people's views, some require ideological transformation, some require ideological emancipation, and some require correcting their ideological style and methods. However, the important thing is to let them see more facts.

In the wave of the great leap forward in production, indigenous methods have repeatedly shown their skills, constantly changing people's views of them with their brilliant achievements. Look, indigenous fertilizers are blooming everywhere, powerfully promoting agricultural production; as indigenous blast furnaces and small converters develop, steel production surges… The news published in today's newspaper that Chongqing has refined metallic aluminum using indigenous methods has provided a vivid lesson for those who trust "foreign" and not "indigenous."

The success of indigenous aluminum refining has solved an important problem in current socialist construction. In the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the shortage of copper and aluminum is a rather prominent contradiction. If this weak link is not well overcome, it will seriously affect the smooth development of industries such as power and machine manufacturing. Therefore, it is necessary for all localities to take increasing copper and aluminum production as seriously as they grasp steel and mechanical equipment. However, how to rapidly develop copper and aluminum production? The key lies in following the mass line and relying on the masses to widely mine and smelt copper and aluminum using indigenous methods. The problem of indigenous copper smelting was solved long ago, but indigenous aluminum refining was a fortress that had not yet been breached. Now, Chongqing has created the experience of indigenous aluminum refining, which provides extremely favorable conditions for freely developing copper and aluminum production. Here, indigenous methods have made another major contribution to socialist construction!

The success of indigenous aluminum refining also demonstrates the infinite creativity of indigenous methods. Before this, people who didn't believe in indigenous methods had a theory: Indigenous methods are just inheriting the skills of our ancestors, refining iron, refining copper, doing carpentry and blacksmithing; they cannot be widely applied, let alone solve complex technical problems. Now, the workers of the Nantong mining area in Chongqing have refuted this view with facts. Not only did the Chinese ancestors not pass down any ready-made experience for indigenous aluminum refining, but even in countries around the world, aluminum refining is done using another foreign method – electrolysis. However, today indigenous methods have broken through this technical fortress and created a new precedent for aluminum refining.

We believe that indigenous methods are the creations of the masses in production practice and are currently the most economical and effective methods. Of course, this in no way means that we oppose foreign methods or modernized large-scale production. On the contrary, we advocate combining indigenous and foreign methods and advocate adopting the latest technological achievements in the world as much as possible, but this is not contradictory to the simultaneous widespread adoption of indigenous methods. Doesn't the current practice already fully prove this point?

    土办法又立了一大功
    万向辛
    在工农业生产大跃进中，也有思想斗争。斗争之一，就是反对信“洋”不信“土”的思想，坚决贯彻“土洋并举”的方针。
    信“洋”不信“土”的人有几种不同的情况。有的人是因为资产阶级思想的尾巴还没有割掉，对于劳动人民的创造总觉得不值一顾；有的人是因为“精神状态还带着被压迫者的烙印，头脑里还装满了种种迷信、恐惧和自卑感”；还有一些人是由于脱离实际地希望“一步登天”，马上现代化。这些人共同的特点是瞧不起土办法，因而不愿意采用土办法。
    要纠正这些人的看法，有的是改造思想的问题，有的是解放思想的问题，有的是端正思想作风思想方法的问题。但是，重要的一条，还是让他们多看看事实。
    在生产大跃进的浪潮中，土办法已经一再大显身手，用它们辉煌的事迹不断地改变着人们对它的观感。看，土化肥遍地开花，有力地促进了农业增产；土高炉、小转炉一发展，钢铁产量猛增……。今天本报发表的重庆用土法炼出金属铝的消息，又为信“洋”不信“土”的人上了生动的一课。
    土法炼铝成功，解决了当前社会主义建设中的一个重要问题。在目前工农业生产大跃进中，铜、铝不足是一个相当突出的矛盾。这个薄弱环节如不很好地克服，就将严重影响电力和机器制造等工业的顺利发展。因此，各地有必要像抓钢铁、机械设备那样，把增产铜、铝这件事认真地抓起来。但是，如何迅速发展铜、铝生产呢？关键在于走群众路线，依靠群众用土法广泛地开采和冶炼铜、铝。土法炼铜的问题早解决了，土法炼铝过去还是个没有攻破的堡垒。现在，重庆创造出了土法炼铝的经验，这就为放手发展铜、铝生产提供了极为有利的条件。在这里，土法又为社会主义建设立了一大功！
    土法炼铝成功，还表明了土法的无穷创造力。在这以前，不信土法的人有种论调：土办法不过是继承老祖宗的本领，炼炼铁，炼炼铜，做做木匠、铁匠活儿；它既不能广泛应用，更不能解决复杂的技术问题。现在，重庆南桐矿区的职工用事实驳斥了这种看法。土法炼铝不但中国人的老祖宗没有传下什么现成经验，就是世界各国，炼铝也都是用的另外一种洋办法——电解法。可是，今天土办法攻破了这个技术堡垒，开创了炼铝的新例。
    我们认为，土法是群众在生产实践中的创造，在目前是最经济最有效的办法。当然，这丝毫不意味着我们反对洋法、反对现代化的大生产。相反，我们主张土洋并举，主张尽可能地采用世界上最新的技术成就，然而这与同时广泛地采用土法一点也不矛盾。当前的实践不已经充分证明了这一点吗？
