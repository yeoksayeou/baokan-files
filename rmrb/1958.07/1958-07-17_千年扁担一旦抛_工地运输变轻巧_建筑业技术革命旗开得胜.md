Once the Thousand-Year-Old Carrying Pole is Thrown Away, Construction Site Transportation Becomes Easy and Nimble
The Construction Industry's Technological Revolution Gets Off to a Flying Start

    (Our Dispatch) The broad masses of workers and staff in the national construction industry have launched a magnificent technological innovation movement. The cutting edge of technological innovation is first directed at the most backward link in the construction industry – the shoulder-carrying and man-hauling transportation method. Many construction enterprises, after several days and nights of hard work, abandoned the carrying pole used for thousands of years, realizing vehicle-based ground transportation and mechanized vertical transportation. According to statistics from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, construction companies in twenty-three provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia, as well as units directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering and Zhangye General Company, have all or basically eliminated the phenomenon of shoulder-carrying and man-hauling.

    In mid-June, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the China Construction Trade Union held an on-site technological innovation conference in Shanghai. The conference issued a call to the million workers and staff in the national construction industry: "Put down the carrying pole in two months and eliminate shoulder-carrying and man-hauling; fully use improved tools within half a year; actively prepare conditions and move towards mechanized construction and industrialized building!" After the meeting, a vigorous mass technological innovation movement unfolded in the construction industry with the force of a thunderbolt.

    In the "Put Down the Carrying Pole" movement, the construction enterprises in Shanghai and Tianjin took the lead. From June 2nd to June 8th, more than 100 construction sites in Shanghai, after seven days of hard work, created and improved more than 40 kinds of ground and aerial transportation tools, manufactured 1,400 various types of vehicles, more than 200 hoisting machines, and laid more than 10,000 meters of tracks made of angle iron, steel bars, mao bamboo, and wooden boards, quickly eliminating the phenomenon of shoulder-carrying and man-hauling. In Tianjin, the first city in the country to advocate "Putting Down the Carrying Pole," construction workers submitted more than 47,000 technical innovation proposals by the end of June. Each construction site adopted three methods according to its specific circumstances: human-powered mechanical transportation, combined human-powered tools and power-driven tools transportation, and fully mechanized transportation, replacing shoulder-carrying and man-hauling. Workers and staff in construction enterprises in other provinces and cities also plunged into this movement with soaring enthusiasm. The leading construction enterprises in thirteen provinces and cities in Hebei Province achieved the goal of "Putting Down the Carrying Pole and Liberating Both Shoulders" in five days. Enterprises affiliated with the Baoding Construction Engineering Bureau fought hard for two days and nights, throwing away the carrying pole and using 26 kinds of transportation machines they manufactured themselves.

    The broad masses of construction workers were all overjoyed after freeing themselves from the heavy labor of shoulder-carrying and man-hauling with their own hands. Some tied up carrying poles and pasted seals on them, indicating that they would bid farewell to them forever; others brought carrying poles to the leadership departments to report the good news. Construction workers in Shanghai also composed ballads to express their inner joy: "Ideological liberation leads to creation, the thousand-year-old carrying pole is thrown away today. The Party's leadership is truly brilliant, everyone laughs as the carrying pole comes off their shoulders!"

    As a result of changing transportation to vehicles and machines, work efficiency has been greatly improved. The transportation efficiency of Tianjin's construction sites has generally increased by 50%, and the highest has increased by eight times. In Lanzhou, construction workers used to carry soil in pairs, carrying only more than 200 kilograms each time. Now, they use vehicles made by themselves, and one person can push more than 400 kilograms of soil each time, increasing work efficiency by three times.

    The "Put Down the Carrying Pole" movement has opened the prelude to the technological innovation movement in the construction industry. The broad masses of construction workers are taking advantage of the victory to attack the backward operating techniques of other types of work. Workers in the 401 work zone of the Shanghai Fourth Construction Company, after spending five days eliminating shoulder-carrying and man-hauling, spent another three days eliminating illiteracy. The mass technological innovation movement has developed from manufacturing simple tools such as vehicles and cables to manufacturing complex semi-mechanized and mechanized machines. The workers at this construction site have begun and are preparing to manufacture soil-laying machines and hand-cranked small concrete mixing machines. Duan Youhong, a construction worker in Tianjin, has successfully modified an electric rammer and is manufacturing it in large quantities. With this rammer, supplemented by pneumatic rammers, all construction sites will be able to completely put down the tampers by the third quarter, freeing workers from this heavy manual labor. Duan Ziming, deputy director of the processing plant of Tianjin Fourth Construction Engineering Company and a local expert, created three machines: an automatic installation machine, an automatic auxiliary vehicle, and a ruler, which have realized the mechanization of all processes in the factory prefabrication of woodworking projects.

### 千年扁担一旦抛　工地运输变轻巧  建筑业技术革命旗开得胜

    千年扁担一旦抛　工地运输变轻巧
    建筑业技术革命旗开得胜
    本报讯　全国建筑业广大职工掀起波澜壮阔的技术革新运动。革新技术的锋芒首先指向建筑业中最落后的环节——肩挑人抬的运输方式。许多建筑企业都是经过几昼夜的苦战，就抛弃了千年沿用的扁担杠棒，实现了地面运输车子化、垂直运输机械化。据建筑工程部统计，现在已有北京、上海、河北、山东、黑龙江、四川、湖南、甘肃、内蒙古等二十三个省、市、自治区的建筑公司，以及建筑工程部直属公司、张掖总公司等单位全部或基本上消灭了肩挑人抬的现象。
    建筑工程部和中国建筑工会全国委员会6月中旬在上海召开了技术革新现场会议。会议向全国建筑业百万职工发出号召：“两个月放下扁担，消灭肩挑人抬；半年内全部使用改良工具；积极准备条件，向施工机械化、建筑工业化迈进！”会后，一个势如破竹的群众性技术革新运动，便在建筑业中蓬勃展开。
    在“放下扁担”的运动中，上海、天津两市的建筑企业走在了最前面。上海市一百多个建筑工地在6月2日到6月8日，经过七天苦战，创造和改进了四十多种地面和空中运输工具，制造出了一千四百辆各式各样的车子，二百多架起重吊装机械，铺起一万多公尺用角铁、钢筋、毛竹、木板做的轨道，迅速消灭了肩挑人抬的现象。在全国首倡“放下扁担”的天津市建筑业的职工，到6月底共提出技术革新建议四万七千多件。各个工地分别情况采用人力机械运输、人力机具和动力机具联合运输、全部机械化运输三类办法，代替了肩挑人抬。其他省、市建筑企业的职工也以冲天干劲投入了这一运动。河北省的十三个省、市领导的建筑企业，五天就实现了“放下扁担，解放两肩”的奋斗目标。保定建筑工程局所属企业，奋战两昼夜，就抛掉扁担，用起自己制造的二十六种运输机具。
    广大建筑工人用自己的双手摆脱了肩挑人抬的笨重劳动以后，都欢欣鼓舞。有的把扁担杠棒捆起来，贴上封条，表示和它们永远告别；有的带着扁担到领导部门报喜。上海的建筑工人还编了歌谣表达自己内心的欢乐：“思想解放搞创造，千年扁担今朝撂。党的领导真英明，扁担下肩大家笑！”
    由于运输改用车子、机械，工作效率大大提高。天津各工地的运输效率一般提高了50％，最高的提高了八倍。兰州市的建筑工人过去两个人抬土，每次只能抬二百多公斤，现在改用自己制造的车子，一个人每次能推土四百多公斤，工作效率提高三倍。
    “放下扁担”运动，为建筑业的技术革新运动揭开了序幕。广大建筑工人正在乘胜向其他工种落后的操作技术冲锋。上海市第四建筑公司四零一工区的工人，在花了五天时间突击消灭肩挑人抬以后，又花了三天时间突击消灭了文盲。群众性的技术革新运动，已经从制造车子、缆索等简单工具，进一步发展到制造复杂的半机械化、机械化的机器。这个工地的工人已经着手和准备制造泥土砌墙机、手摇小型混凝土拌和机等机器。天津市建筑工人段有洪改制成功了电动打夯机，正在大量制造。用这种打夯机，再辅之以风动打夯机，到第三季度，各工地就可以全部放下夯硪，使工人从这种笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。天津第四建筑工程公司加工厂副厂长、土专家段子明创造了自动安装机、自动副车和标尺三项机具，使木作工程的工厂预制部分实现了全部工序机械化。
