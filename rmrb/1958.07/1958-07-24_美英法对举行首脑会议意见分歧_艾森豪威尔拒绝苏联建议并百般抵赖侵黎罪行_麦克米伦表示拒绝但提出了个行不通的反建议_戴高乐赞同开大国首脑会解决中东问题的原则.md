Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd dispatch from Washington: US President Eisenhower, on July 22nd, replied to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, brazenly rejecting Khrushchev's proposal to him on the 19th to immediately hold a summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India to discuss the tense situation in the Middle East caused by the armed aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan.

　　In his reply, Eisenhower spared no effort to distort the facts, repeatedly quibbling about the US armed aggression against Lebanon, and trying to mislead public opinion and reduce the serious threat to world peace caused by the US aggression in the Middle East. He shamelessly and openly described the US armed intervention in Lebanon as "assisting a small country to maintain its independence is not aggression." He tried his best to deny the fact that "the actions taken by the United States in Lebanon are to undermine peace," insisting that he could not agree with this statement, and saying that the "motive" of the US actions in Lebanon was "to help stop outside instigated actions aimed at undermining the true independence and integrity of that small country." Ignoring the fact that the United States and Britain have already sent large numbers of troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, and are still actively preparing to expand the aggression by continuing to amass large armies, Eisenhower pretended to be deaf and dumb, saying that he did not know of "any armed conflict" in the Middle East and that he "did not know of any factual basis" to show that there was a "danger of a major war."

　　Eisenhower also maliciously slandered and threatened the Middle Eastern countries' desire for national independence. He described the Middle Eastern countries' movement for national independence as a "real danger to peace," and "the United States firmly opposes this danger." He said that if Middle Eastern countries were "one after another swallowed up by Soviet-supported expansion and aggression," it would "create a real danger of war." He also disregarded the bloody facts of the direct armed suppression by the United States and Britain of the struggle of the Lebanese and Jordanian people for independence and freedom, and hypocritically said, "This is not to say that the United States is committed to making the status quo in the Arab world permanent. The United States recognizes and sympathizes with the desire of the Arab peoples to achieve a greater degree of national unity."

　　Eisenhower also fabricated lies, describing the US trampling on the UN Charter and implementing armed aggression against Lebanon by bypassing the Security Council as "fully in line with the recognized principles of international law and the UN Charter." He claimed that the Soviet proposal to convene a five-nation conference to discuss the emergency situation in the Middle East "seems to intend to further weaken the power and prestige of the United Nations." He said: "What you are proposing is, in effect, that the five countries reach what you call 'recommendations' on the Near and Middle East without UN approval and in a manner inconsistent with the UN Charter," which would make the UN a "'rubber stamp' for a few great powers."

　　Eisenhower rejected the Soviet proposal, and said, "If the Soviet Union truly believes that there is now an imminent threat to world peace, the matter must be submitted to the Security Council." He said, "If everyone wants such a meeting to be held, the United States will act together with everyone according to this procedure."

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd dispatch from London: British Prime Minister Macmillan, in a letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev on the 22nd, rejected the Soviet proposal to immediately convene a summit conference of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India in order to find a way to extinguish the flames of war that had begun to burn in the Middle East.

　　In his letter, Macmillan deliberately created a smokescreen, trying to minimize the serious danger of war caused by the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, saying that he "does not agree with your view that the world is currently on the brink of military disaster. I say this with complete certainty knowing the peaceful intentions of the Western countries and believing that the Soviet government itself will not take steps leading to a world war."

　　At the same time, Macmillan also attempted to defend Britain's aggression against Jordan, saying that he "completely cannot accept any description you make of our actions in sending troops to Jordan, our motives, and the situation in Jordan itself." However, apart from repeating the nonsense that British troops were there to "protect an independent small country that had asked us for help against the threat of externally instigated aggression and subversion," he could not provide any facts to answer the solemn accusations against British aggression in Jordan in the Soviet proposal.

　　Obviously considering that directly rejecting the Soviet proposal would completely expose Britain's adherence to war adventures and enmity with the people of the world, Macmillan dared not directly reject the Soviet proposal to immediately hold a five-nation summit conference. He said that although he rejected the "premise" of this proposal, he did not reject the "conclusion" of this proposal, and he hypocritically expressed agreement: "It would be useful if the heads of government could find an opportunity to meet soon to discuss the Middle East issue." However, immediately afterwards, Macmillan, under the guise of "should not bypass the procedural rules in the Security Council," put forward a proposal to hold a so-called "special meeting of the UN Security Council," attempting to replace the five-nation summit conference proposed by the Soviet Union with this meeting. Macmillan wanted Khrushchev to express his agreement that "the meeting you are requesting should be held in the Security Council," thereby deliberately confusing the fundamental difference between the five-nation summit conference requested by the Soviet Union and this special meeting of the Security Council requested by Britain.

　　The letter also stated that the British government "has no intention of putting forward any proposals at this special meeting of the Security Council" in order to avoid "recording the differences through voting," which shows that Britain has no intention at all of conducting any serious discussions on the Middle East situation at this meeting and finding a way to resolve the tense situation in the Middle East.

　　Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister De Gaulle stated in his reply to Khrushchev on the 22nd that he agreed with the principle of convening a great power summit conference to resolve the Middle East issue. De Gaulle's reply was handed over to Soviet Ambassador to Paris Vinogradov by French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Joxe on the same evening.

　　De Gaulle said in his letter that he had "very carefully studied" Khrushchev's letter regarding the holding of a Middle East government summit conference. He said, "The French government has always believed that it is appropriate for the major powers to hold serious discussions on issues on which they have disagreements or that may endanger peace. Therefore, we agree with the principle of holding a conference on the Middle East issue."

　　At the same time, De Gaulle defended the US and British imperialists' aggressive actions in the Middle East in his reply, and described the actions of French warships lurking outside the port of Beirut not long ago, attempting to intervene, as only preparing to "assist French expatriates when necessary."

　　A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said earlier on the same day, when talking about the responses of the three Western countries to Khrushchev's proposal, that the French government did not agree to holding a top-level meeting within the scope of the United Nations in New York, and that France advocated that the meeting be held in Geneva "after careful preparation." The spokesman also said that France has always favored holding talks with the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue; France had repeatedly proposed this to the United States and Britain, but the three countries had never been able to "reach an agreement on any specific proposal."

### 美英法对举行首脑会议意见分歧  艾森豪威尔拒绝苏联建议并百般抵赖侵黎罪行  麦克米伦表示拒绝但提出了个行不通的反建议  戴高乐赞同开大国首脑会解决中东问题的原则

    美英法对举行首脑会议意见分歧
    艾森豪威尔拒绝苏联建议并百般抵赖侵黎罪行
    麦克米伦表示拒绝但提出了个行不通的反建议
    戴高乐赞同开大国首脑会解决中东问题的原则
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔7月22日复信苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，悍然拒绝了赫鲁晓夫在19日向他提出的立即举行苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议，讨论由于美、英两国武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而造成的中东紧张局势的建议。
    艾森豪威尔在复信里极尽颠倒黑白的能事，百般为美国武装侵略黎巴嫩的行动狡辩，并且力图迷惑舆论，缩小美国对中东地区的侵略行动对世界和平所造成的严重威胁。他把美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉公然无耻地说做：“这样协助一个小国维持它的独立并不是侵略”。他竭力抵赖“美国在黎巴嫩采取的行动是为了破坏和平”的事实，硬说他不能同意这种说法，并说美国在黎巴嫩的行动的“动机是为了要协助制止外界煽动的、目的是要破坏那个小国的真正独立和完整的行动”。艾森豪威尔不顾美、英两国已经派遣大批军队侵略了黎巴嫩和约旦，并且还在继续调集大军积极准备扩大侵略的事实，竟然装聋卖傻，说他不知道在中东地区“有什么武装冲突”，“不知道有任何事实根据”说明有“发生大战的危险”。
    艾森豪威尔还对中近东国家要求民族独立的愿望进行了恶意的污蔑和恫吓。他把中东国家争取民族独立的运动说成是“对和平的真正危险”，“美国坚决地反对这种危险”。他说什么如果中东国家“一个接着一个被苏联支持的扩张和侵略势力所吞并”，就会“产生真正的战争危险”。他还不顾美英两国直接武装镇压黎、约人民争取独立和自由的斗争的血腥事实，假惺惺地说，“这并不是说美国致力于使阿拉伯世界的现状永久存在下去。美国承认并且同情阿拉伯各国人民要求实现更大程度的民族统一的愿望”。
    艾森豪威尔还信口雌黄，把美国践踏联合国宪章并且越过安理会而对黎巴嫩所实行的武装侵略，说成“是完全符合国际法的公认原则和联合国宪章的”。而苏联召开五国会议讨论中东紧急局势的建议倒是“似乎打算进一步削弱联合国的权力和威信”。他说：“你所建议的实际上就是五国在没有联合国核准和不符合联合国宪章的情况下达成你所说的关于中近东的‘建议’，然后把它提交联合国安全理事会”，这将使联合国成为“少数大国的‘橡皮图章’。”
    艾森豪威尔拒绝了苏联的建议，他并且说，“如果苏联真正认为现在存在一种对世界和平的迫切威胁，必须把问题提交安全理事会”。他说，“如果大家都希望举行这样一次会议，美国将同大家一起按照这个程序行事。”
    新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦在22日写信给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，拒绝了苏联关于立即召开苏、美、英、法、印五国政府首脑会议以便设法扑灭在中东开始燃烧的战火的建议。
    麦克米伦在信中故意制造烟幕，力图缩小美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦所引起的严重战争危险，说什么他“不同意你的认为世界目前濒于军事灾难边缘的见解。我说这一点的时候完全肯定地知道西方国家的和平意图，并且相信苏联政府本身也不会采取导致世界大战的步骤。”
    麦克米伦同时还企图为英国侵略约旦的行动进行辩解，说他“完全不能接受你对我们派遣军队到约旦去的行动、我们的动机以及约旦本身的局势所作的任何描述。”但是，他除了重复了什么英国军队是去“保护曾经要求我们帮助对付从外面鼓动的侵略和颠复威胁的一个独立的小国家”的鬼话以外，提不出任何事实来回答苏联建议中对于英国侵略约旦的严正指责。
    显然是考虑到直截了当地拒绝苏联建议将彻底地暴露出英国坚持战争冒险而与世界人民为敌的面目，麦克米伦不敢直接地拒绝苏联关于立即举行五国首脑会议的建议。他说，他虽然拒绝了这个建议的“前提”，但他并不拒绝这个建议的“结论”，他虚伪地表示同意：“如果政府首脑能够找到一个早日开会讨论中东问题的机会，那将是有用的。”但是，紧接着，麦克米伦以“不应该越过安全理事会中的议事程序”为幌子，提出了一个要求举行所谓“联合国安全理事会特别会议”的建议，企图以这个会议来代替苏联建议召开的五国政府首脑会议。麦克米伦要赫鲁晓夫表示同意“你所要求举行的会议应该在安全理事会中举行”，从而故意地混淆了苏联要求召开的五国政府首脑会议同英国要求召开的这个安理会特别会议之间的原则的区别。
    这封信还表示，英国政府“无意在安全理事会的这种特别会议上提出任何提案”，以免“通过表决把分歧记下来”，这就表明了英国根本无意在这个会议上进行关于中东局势的任何认真的讨论和找出解决中东紧张局势的办法。
    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理戴高乐22日在写给赫鲁晓夫的复信中表示，他赞成召开大国首脑会议来解决中东问题的原则。戴高乐的复信已经由法国外交部秘书长约克斯在当天晚间交给苏联驻巴黎大使维诺格拉多夫。
    戴高乐在信里说，他已经“非常慎重地研究了”赫鲁晓夫关于举行中东问题政府首脑会议的信件。他说，“法国政府一向认为，大国之间就它们有分歧的或可能危害和平的问题进行认真的讨论是相宜的。因此我们赞同举行一次关于中东问题的会议的原则。”
    同时，戴高乐在复信里替美、英帝国主义者在中东的侵略行动进行辩护，并且把不久前法国军舰在贝鲁特港外虎视眈眈、企图插手干涉的行动说成只是准备“在必要时协助法国侨民”。
    法国外交部发言人在同一天的早些时候谈到西方三国对赫鲁晓夫建议的答复时说，法国政府不赞成在纽约联合国范围内举行最高级会议，法国主张这个会议在“经过认真准备之后”在日内瓦举行。这个发言人还说，法国一向赞成同苏联就中东问题举行会谈；法国曾经多次向美英两国提出过这一点，但是三国始终没有能够“就某种具体建议达成协议。”
