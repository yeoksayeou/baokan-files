    Striving for the Upstream Means Striving for First Place
    Wang Pu
    The people of Yu County, Shanxi, who were the first in the country to build a "native railway," have recently put forward a new heroic slogan: By next year, the average steel production per capita will surpass that of Great Britain!
    What kind of county is Yu County? It is a very small county with a population of only 180,000. It is also a very poor county, with over 60% of its area being barren mountainous land. Until last year, the average yield per mu had never exceeded 200 jin. Before 1956, this county had no modern industry at all, only a small amount of handicrafts. Such a county dares to propose such a grand plan, completely disregarding capitalist powers like Great Britain. What does this illustrate? It shows that the people of Yu County are striving for the upstream and striving for first place.
    The poorer the people, the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm. Now, it seems that no one publicly says that being "poor and blank" is a "bad thing"; however, there are probably still not many people who truly believe and deeply experience that being "poor and blank" is a "good thing." Now, not many people disbelieve that we can eventually catch up with Great Britain; however, there are still people who doubt that we can catch up with Great Britain quickly. For these people who lack confidence and have short-sighted vision, the people of Yu County have given them a solid lesson in striving for the upstream.
    This illustrates that "counties," which have historically only engaged in agriculture, can not only establish light industry, but also heavy industry; not only can they establish a small amount of industry, but also a large amount of industry. Now, there are no people who believe that counties cannot establish industry; however, there are still quite a few who believe that counties can only establish some simple processing plants and handicraft workshops at present, and that it is impossible to talk about establishing heavy industry in a year or two. Some people believe that even if a county wants to establish heavy industry, it will only be a few small native iron smelting furnaces, a few small hydroelectric power stations of a dozen kilowatts, and one or two small, manually operated farm tool repair shops, which can at most solve some small problems in the county and will not become a "big climate." For these people, the people of Yu County have also given them a solid lesson in striving for the upstream. In just one short year, the small Yu County has not only established an iron factory, but also a steel factory; not only has it produced molten iron and molten steel, but it also wants to make the average steel production per capita surpass that of Great Britain; not only has it established a farm tool repair and manufacturing plant, but it also wants to develop it into manufacturing power machinery and machine tools to equip its own township industry and commune industry. Looking at these facts, who would dare to underestimate county industry! Who dares to say that county industry cannot strive for the upstream and strive for first place?
    All of this illustrates that the 500 million revolutionary peasants are an important pillar for the realization of socialist industrialization in our country. Our peasants are not only providers of grain and raw materials for light industry, not only a huge market for industrial products, but also a vital force in developing heavy industry. Who is it that relies on to establish industry on a large scale in counties without an industrial base and without a working class? It is the peasants. County-run industry is essentially peasant-run industry. According to materials from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, more than 13,000 small and medium-sized iron smelting blast furnaces will be built nationwide this year, with a total annual production capacity of more than 20 million tons, equivalent to four to five times the current production capacity of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works; more than 200 steelmaking converters will be built nationwide this year, with a total annual production capacity of more than 10 million tons, equivalent to two to three times the current production capacity of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. These medium-sized and small blast furnaces and converters are mainly run by peasants. However, there are still quite a few people who underestimate the status and role of peasants in our country's realistic industrialization cause, especially underestimating the role of peasants in developing heavy industry. The source of the "soft bone disease" of those who do not believe that we can quickly catch up with Great Britain and do not believe that counties can establish heavy industry on a large scale lies in this. The greatest inspiration that the heroic spirit of the people of Yu County gives us also lies in this.
    We must fully estimate the strength of the 500 million peasants, and we must fully mobilize the strength of the 500 million peasants. By organizing the 500 million peasants to run industry, we can push our country's industry forward at the highest speed that the world cannot imagine.
    All counties should strive for the upstream and strive for first place like Yu County!

    争上游就是争第一
    王朴
    全国第一个办“土铁路”的山西盂县人民，最近又提出了新的英雄口号：按人口平均的钢铁产量，明年要压倒英国！
    盂县是一个什么样的县呢？它是一个很小的县，全县只有十八万人口。它又是一个很穷的县，全县60％以上是贫瘠的山地，到去年为止，每亩平均产量从来没有超过二百斤；在1956年以前，这个县根本没有现代工业，只有少量的手工业。这样的一个县，竟胆敢提出如此宏伟的规划，把英国等资本主义大国完全不放在眼里，这说明什么问题呢？说明盂县的人民在争上游争第一。
    人越穷，革命的劲头越大。现在，公开说“一穷二白”是“坏事”的人似乎没有了；但是，真正信服和深刻体验到“一穷二白”是“好事”的人，恐怕还不很多。现在，不相信我们最终能够赶上英国的人不多了；但是，怀疑我们能够很快赶上英国的人，却还有人在。对于这些信心不足、目光短浅的人，盂县的人民给他们上了结结实实的争上游的一堂课。
    这说明：历史上从来只是务农的“县”，不仅能办轻工业，而且能办重工业；不仅能办少量的工业，而且能办大量的工业。现在认为县不能办工业的人没有了，但是，认为目前县只能办一些简单的加工厂和手工作坊，办重工业一两年还谈不到的人，却不在少数。有的人认为，一个县，即使要办重工业，也不过是几个小小的土炼铁炉，几座小小的十来个瓩的水电站，一两个小小的手工操作的农具修配厂，充其量只能解决县里的一些小问题，成不了“大气候”。对于这些人，盂县人民也给他们上了结结实实的争上游的一堂课。小小的盂县，在短短的一年中，不仅办起了铁厂，而且办起了钢厂；不仅流出了铁水、钢水，而且要使按人口平均的钢铁产量压倒英国；不仅办起了农具修配制造厂，而且要把它发展到制造动力机械和工作母机，来装备自己的乡工业、社工业。看看这些事实，谁还敢小觑县工业！谁敢说县工业不能争上游争第一？
    所有这一切都说明：五亿革命的农民，是我国实现社会主义工业化的重要支柱。我国的农民，不但是粮食和轻工业原料的提供者，不仅是工业品的巨大市场，而且是一支发展重工业的生力军。在没有工业基础、没有工人阶级的县里平地大办起工业来，这靠的是谁呢？靠的就是农民。县办工业，实质上就是农民办工业。据冶金工业部的材料，今年全国将要建设起一万三千多座小型的和中型的炼铁高炉，它们每年总的生产能力为两千多万吨，等于目前鞍山炼铁厂生产能力的四倍到五倍；今年全国将要建设起二百多座炼钢转炉，它们每年总的生产能力为一千多万吨，等于目前鞍钢炼钢厂生产能力的两倍到三倍。这些中、小型的高炉和转炉，主要就是靠农民办的。可是，现在还有相当多的人对农民在我国现实工业化事业中的地位和作用估计不足，特别是对农民在发展重工业中的作用估计不足。前面所说的那些不相信我们能很快赶上英国的人，不相信县里能够大办重工业的人，他们的“软骨病”的病源即在于此。盂县人民的英雄气概对我们的最大的启发，也在于此。
    我们必须充分估计五亿农民的力量，必须充分发动五亿农民的力量。把五亿农民组织起来办工业，我们就可以把我国的工业以世人所想像不到的最高的速度推向前进。
    所有的县都应当像盂县一样争上游，争第一！
