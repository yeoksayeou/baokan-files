    Excellent, Build More!
    —Visiting the Red Flag Refinery of the Beijing Petroleum Institute
    By our reporters Zhu Jigong and Wei Wenhua

    In an open space within the Beijing Petroleum Institute, several new buildings have been erected: brick platforms, iron towers welded from old gasoline barrels, and brick-built furnace stacks… Inside a small flat-roofed house, three machines are turning. More than fifty people are working on the furnace stacks and the construction site, men and women, their bodies and faces covered in oil and dirt. At first glance, they look like workers, but upon closer inquiry, they are young teachers and students. This is the school's Red Flag Refinery.

    The factory's director is Chen Yu, a young teacher in the petroleum refining department and a Communist Party member. He told reporters that the factory's construction began at 2:00 PM on the 24th of last month. After six days of intense labor, the main construction was completed by the afternoon of the 30th. The fire was lit at 11:50 PM that day, and ten minutes later, oil was produced in the first minute of "July 1st," the Party's birthday. Now, the second furnace is being fired. Each furnace is loaded with 25 tons of coal, burning for 35 to 40 hours, yielding over one ton of oil. It is estimated that the factory will burn for 300 days a year, using 5,000 tons of coal and producing 300 tons of coal tar. The construction costs of the factory were saved from the school's budget. Students and teachers did the work themselves during the construction process, with only a few technical workers providing guidance and assistance. As a result, everyone learned all the construction techniques after the factory was built.

    During the construction of this small refinery, teachers and students encountered many difficulties, both technical and material. Initially, the bricks they laid did not meet specifications, and they had to be torn down and rebuilt multiple times. The oil pool they built leaked oil. After inspection, it was found that there were gaps between the cement base and the brick walls, so they reworked and repaired it. When installing the header pipe, they lacked experience and installed it unevenly, causing the first furnace's production to be abnormal. They disassembled it and reinstalled it evenly. In the factory construction, there were minor problems with everything from the furnace to the chimney and oil pool. They constantly inspected and improved in practice. Some more significant difficulties were overcome by teachers and students breaking superstitions and boldly imagining solutions. Originally, they used a standard design from a small refinery of the petroleum department. During the construction process, teachers and students continuously modified it based on practice to make it more suitable for rural needs. The original design for the gas pipeline used steel plates rolled and placed on the ground. They researched using ceramic drain tiles buried underground instead, saving steel plates. A small portion of the pipeline on the ground was also made from rolled iron sheets. Some people initially suspected that ceramic drain tiles would cause explosions, but the situation is now very good. They couldn't find an exhaust fan, so they made one themselves using wood for the casing and iron sheets for the core. The coking retort was originally designed to be rolled from steel plates. On the one hand, they couldn't roll them; on the other hand, they considered that this item alone would cost three to four thousand yuan. Therefore, they researched a redesign using discarded boiler cores welded together as a substitute. The original design for the coking retort had a diameter of 1.4 meters, while the boiler core had a diameter of only 0.92 meters. They researched lengthening it, solving this problem and greatly saving costs. During the construction, teachers and students studied how to express the latest scientific achievements in the most economical and simple way. For example, the foam cooler is the latest research result from the Soviet Union. When it first came out of the laboratory, it was applied to the acid and alkali industry. Now, through the collective efforts of teachers and students, it has been applied to the petroleum industry, modifying the original design's complex 9-meter-high cooling tower and replacing it with three old gasoline barrels welded together and erected. This is simpler and reduces the investment from 1,700 yuan to 240 yuan, and the operating efficiency is also much higher than the original design's cooling tower. The original standard design for this type of factory could only produce three products: heavy diesel, petroleum coke, and semi-coke. Now, the factory built after bold design modifications is confident in producing six products: light diesel, heavy diesel, petroleum coke, gas, phenol, and semi-coke. In addition, they are preparing to combine coal dry distillation with indigenous coking methods to produce both petroleum products and coke that can be used for iron smelting in small blast furnaces.

    The students participating in production at the factory are a vital force in the great leap forward of China's petroleum production industry. According to the person in charge, students can preliminarily learn the entire production process of a small refinery in just three days or so, and ordinary rural laborers can master it in about two weeks. During this summer vacation, the institute will send more than 500 students in batches to rural areas to help farmers establish small refineries. The students currently participating in production are the first batch preparing to depart.

    On the afternoon of the 10th, Comrade Kang Sheng, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, visited the construction site of this newly built refinery. The young students covered in oil immediately cheered. After Comrade Kang Sheng finished the visit, the students enthusiastically asked Comrade Kang Sheng to say a few words. Comrade Kang Sheng said: My words are very simple: The first sentence is, "Excellent!"; the second sentence is, "Build more!". He also said: Schools can also implement the method of combining large, medium, and small scales. Several plants with an annual output of several hundred tons and several thousand tons can be built. Comrade Kang Sheng also suggested that all students of the Petroleum Institute learn this simple and practical oil refining skill. He said: In this way, you will be welcomed by the masses when you go to the local areas and rural areas in the future. The young students replied: "Okay! We will definitely learn it." At the request of the teachers and students, Comrade Kang Sheng wrote eleven large characters with a brush on a scarlet piece of paper: "Red Flag Refinery of Beijing Petroleum Institute."

    好得很，多办几个
    ——访北京石油学院红旗炼油厂
    本报记者　朱继功　魏文华
    在北京石油学院里一处空地上，新矗立起几个建筑物、砖砌的台子，用旧汽油桶焊接起来的铁塔，砖砌的炉堆……，在一小间平房里有三台机器正在转动。在炉堆上面和工地劳动的有五十多人，有男有女，身上脸上油污土垢，粗看是工人，细问才知是青年教师和学生。这里就是这个学校的红旗炼油厂。
    这个厂的厂长是石油炼制系的青年教师共产党员陈愈，他向记者介绍，这个工厂是上月24日下午二时动工修建的，中间经六天的紧张劳动，到30日下午就把主要工程建成了。当天晚上十一点五十分点火，十分钟后，在“七一”党的生日那天的第一分钟出油，现在已在烧第二炉。每一炉装二十五吨煤，烧三十五到四十小时，共可出一吨多油。预计一年烧三百天，加五千吨煤，可出煤焦油三百吨。工厂的建立，建筑用费是从学校经费里节约下来的。建厂过程中由学生和教师们动手干，当中只请了几个技术工人来指导和协助，所以工厂建成后大家学会了全部施工技术。
    这座小型炼油厂，在建立过程中师生们遇到许多困难，有技术的，有物质的。他们初建时砌砖不合规格，曾经多次拆了重砌；砌的油池子漏油，经检查后是洋灰底和砖墙之间有缝，也返工修补；安装集合管时因为没有经验，安得不平，第一炉生产时不很正常，又拆开了重新安平。建厂中从炉子到烟筒、油池等都有小毛病，都在实践中不断检查，不断提高。还有些更重大的困难，也经师生们破除迷信，大胆设想，都克服了。原来他们用石油部门的一个小型炼油厂的标准设计，在施工过程中，经教师和学生们从实践中不断加以修改，使它更加适合于农村需要。原来设计的输气管，是用钢板卷成安放在地面上，他们从节约钢板出发，研究用陶质缸瓦管埋在地下代替，有很少一部分在地面上的也用铁皮卷成。原来有人怀疑缸瓦管会引起爆炸，但现在情况很好。他们找不到排风机，就自己动手用木头做壳子，用铁皮做心子，制成一个排风机。焦化釜原设计用钢板卷成，他们一方面卷不了，一方面考虑到这一项就要投资三、四千元，便研究重新设计用废锅炉心子焊起来代替，原来设计的焦化釜直径是一点四公尺，而锅炉心子的直径只有零点九二公尺，他们便研究把它加长，解决了这个难题，费用大大节省了。在施工当中，教师和学生们研究，把科学上最新的成就用最经济简便的办法表现出来。如泡沫冷却器是苏联最新的研究成果，开始走出实验室时是应用到酸碱工业的，现在经师生集体努力把它用到石油工业里来，把原设计中九公尺高结构复杂的冷却塔，修改为用三节旧汽油桶焊接后竖起来代替，既简单，又可使这一项投资由一千七百元降低为二百四十元，而且运转效率也比原设计的冷却塔要高得多。这种工厂，原来标准设计只能生产重柴油、油焦、半焦等三种产品，现在经大胆修改设计后建成的工厂有把握生产轻柴油、重柴油、油焦、煤气、酚、半焦等六种产品。另外，他们正准备把煤的干馏和土法炼焦结合起来，既生产石油产品，也要生产能供小高炉炼铁用的焦炭。
    在工厂参加生产的学生，是我国石油生产事业大跃进中的一支生力军。据负责人谈：小型炼油厂的全部生产过程，学生们只用三天左右的时间就初步学会了，农村一般劳动人民也只要两星期左右就可以掌握。今年暑假期间，这个学院将有五百多学生分批到农村去，准备帮助农民建立小型炼油厂，现在参加生产的就是准备出发的第一批学生。
    10日下午，中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志来到了这座新建的炼油厂工地上。沾满油垢的青年学生们立刻欢跃起来。当康生同志参观完毕，学生们热烈地要求康生同志给讲几句话。康生同志说：我的话很简单：第一句话是好得很；第二句话是多办几个。还说：学校里也可以贯彻大、中、小型相结合的办法，年产几百吨的、年产几千吨的，可以多建几个。康生同志还建议石油学院所有的学生都来学会这一套既简便、又实惠的炼油本领。他说：这样，你们将来到了地方上、农村中，就会受到群众欢迎。青年学生们回答说：“行！我们一定学会它。”康生同志并应师生们的请求，在一方猩红色的纸上用毛笔题了十一个大字：“北京石油学院红旗炼油厂”。
