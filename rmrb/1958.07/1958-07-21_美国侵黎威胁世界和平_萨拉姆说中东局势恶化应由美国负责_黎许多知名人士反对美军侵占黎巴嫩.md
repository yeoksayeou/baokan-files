Xinhua News Agency, 20th—American Cleveland News: Lebanese opposition leader and former Prime Minister Salam, in a long-distance telephone call on the 19th answering questions from a reporter from a radio station in Cleveland, United States, pointed out that the current situation is "very bad" and the reason for this bad situation "is American intervention." He warned that if the situation in the Middle East develops into a world war, the United States will be responsible.
Salam said that the current situation in the Middle East "depends on the Americans, if they withdraw, everything will be fine." He also said that if the American military attacks the rebellious people of Lebanon, "this may trigger a big war, or even a world war."
Salam stated that he disagreed with the replacement of American troops by United Nations forces, saying, "Everyone should get out."
When answering questions about the causes of the Lebanese people's uprising, Salam said that Chamoun was a "sinner" and "the Americans and British supported him."
Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 19th—A group of important figures who have taken a "neutral" attitude or a somewhat pro-government attitude towards the Lebanese uprising protested on the 18th against the landing of American troops in Lebanon and demanded the withdrawal of American troops.
Among these people are Henri Pharaon, Youssef Salem, Philippe Takla, Charles Helou, and Ghassan Tueni. They sent telegrams to Eisenhower and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold, declaring that Lebanon cannot agree to foreign troops landing on its territory.
The telegram said that Lebanon cannot become "a base for any foreign troops." They demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops, believing that "this way Lebanon can solve its own problems."
The other three neutral members of parliament also demanded in a joint statement that all of Lebanon unite and strive for a common goal and a common purpose, that is, the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese territory.

    黎许多知名人士反对美军侵占黎巴嫩
    新华社20日讯  美国克利夫兰消息：黎巴嫩反对党领袖、前总理萨拉姆19日在长途电话中答复美国克利夫兰一家电台的记者的问题时指出，目前的局势“很坏”，造成这种恶劣局势的原因“是美国的干涉”。他警告说，如果中东局势发展成为世界大战，那就要由美国负责。
    萨拉姆说，中东目前的局势“取决于美国人，如果他们撤退，一切就会变得很好”。他还说，如果美军攻击黎巴嫩的起义人民，“这可能爆发大战，甚至爆发世界大战。”
    萨拉姆声明不同意由联合国部队来代替美国军队，他说，“所有的人都应该滚出去”。
    萨拉姆在回答关于黎巴嫩人民起义的原因的问题的时候说，夏蒙是一个“罪人”，而“美国人和英国人支持他”。
    据新华社贝鲁特19日电  对于黎巴嫩的起义采取“中立”态度或是在某种程度上亲政府态度的一批重要人物，18日抗议美国军队在黎巴嫩登陆并要求美国军队撤退。
    这批人中有亨利·法拉昂、优素福·萨勒姆、菲利普·塔克拉、夏尔·埃劳和加桑·特韦尼，他们打电报给艾森豪威尔和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，宣布黎巴嫩不能同意外国军队在它的领土上登陆。
    电报说，黎巴嫩不能成为“任何外国军队的基地”。他们要求撤出外国军队，认为“这样黎巴嫩就可以自行解决自己的问题”。
    其他三位中立的议员也在联合声明中要求整个黎巴嫩团结一致，为共同的目标和共同的目的而奋斗，那就是要外国军队立即撤出黎巴嫩领土。
