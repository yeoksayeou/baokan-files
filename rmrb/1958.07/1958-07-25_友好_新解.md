A New Interpretation of "Friendship"
    Shí Lán
    Lodge stated at the UN Security Council: "No country on earth is more friendly to Arab nationalism than the United States." Just as people all over the world are condemning the United States' barbaric aggression against Lebanon and its strangulation of Arab nationalism, Lodge dares to openly say such a thing, which is utterly shameless. But how familiar this sentence is! When Japanese militarists invaded China, they spoke of "Japan-China amity"; when they advanced into Southeast Asia, they clamored for "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity"; even the openly ambitious Hitler declared that his attempt to annex the whole world was for the sake of establishing a "new order"...
    It turns out that the faces of imperialist robbers are all the same. What Lodge said is not some special language. It's just that under the word "friendship" in the dictionary, in addition to the explanation of "mutual goodwill between friends," a new interpretation should be added: "An excuse for imperialist aggression, massacre, and enslavement of the people of other countries."

    “友好”新解
    石蓝
    洛奇在联合国安理会上表示：“地球上再也没有任何国家比美国更对阿拉伯民族主义友好了。”正当全世界人民都在谴责美国野蛮侵略黎巴嫩、扼杀阿拉伯民族主义的时候，洛奇居然敢公开说出这种话来，真是无耻之尤了。可是这句话又何其耳熟！当年日本军国主义者侵略中国，口口声声“日华亲善”；进兵南洋，又叫嚣着“大东亚共存共荣”；连野心露骨的希特勒也宣称他企图吞并全世界是为了建立“新秩序”……
    原来帝国主义强盗的嘴脸都是一样，洛奇说的并不是什么特殊的语言。只是，在词典中“友好”一词之下，除了解释为“谓友谊之交好也”还要另加一条新解：“帝国主义侵略、屠杀、奴役他国人民的借口”。
