Letters to the Editor

    Regarding the reply in your newspaper's July 8th issue concerning "The Treatment of Retired Staff" from our Bureau's People's Letters Group, specifically the first question, "How should the length of service and retirement pay be calculated for demobilized or transferred military personnel who retire after working in local positions?" the answer was somewhat vague. We are now providing the following supplementary explanation:

    When demobilized military personnel and cadres transferred from the military between September 1, 1955, and April 30, 1957, retire after working in local positions, their time in the military can be continuously calculated as length of service (working years) because they already received demobilization assistance funds upon demobilization or transfer. However, they are not eligible for retirement subsidy fees. The time demobilized military personnel spent at home after leaving the military but before rejoining the local workforce is not calculated as general length of service or continuous length of service (working years).

    When cadres transferred from the military before the end of August 1955 and after May 1, 1957, retire, their original time in the military can be continuously calculated as length of service (working years), and retirement subsidy fees can be calculated and issued according to regulations.　Personnel Bureau of the State Council

    你报7月8日刊载我局人民来信组“关于退职工作人员的待遇问题”中第一问“转业或复员军人到地方工作后，如果再退职，应如何计算工龄和退职金”的答复，有些含糊不清，现作补充说明如下：
    复员军人和1955年9月1日至1957年4月30日期间由军队转业的干部参加地方工作以后，退职的时候，由于他们在复员或转业时，已经领过复员资助金，原在军队工作的时间可以连续计算工龄（工作年限），但不计发退职补助费。复员军人在离开军队以后，重新参加地方工作以前回家的时间，不计算一般工龄和连续工龄（工作年限）。
    1955年8月底以前和1957年5月1日以后从军队转业的干部，退职的时候，他们原在军队工作的时间，可以连续计算工龄（工作年限）并可按规定计发退职补助费。　国务院人事局
