Editor's Note: This report by Comrade Cui Xiyan, the head of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, is worth reading carefully by our readers.

The article "Introducing a Cooperative," written by Comrade Mao Zedong in the first issue of "Red Flag," recommends the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative.

Not long ago, Comrade Cui Xiyan, the head of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative, came to Beijing for a meeting. Many units in Beijing invited him to give reports. He gave thirteen reports, directly reaching 35,000 people, including workers, farmers, government officials, soldiers, students, and democrats.

Many people said after listening to the reports: "This is a report on Marxism-Leninism that is both red and expert, a vivid socialist education. It allows us to see concretely the wisdom and brilliance of the working peasants."

This article is compiled from several reports by Comrade Cui Xiyan.

The land in our Yingju Agricultural Cooperative is poor. Not only is the terrain low-lying, but it is also saline-alkali land. Before liberation, it was "major disasters with heavy rain, minor disasters with light rain, and droughts without rain." Thousands of acres of land often yielded nothing. Even in good harvest years, the highest yield per acre was only fifty or sixty catties. Many people lacked food and clothing and fled famine. In 1942, due to natural disasters, out of the 135 households in the village, 40 fled famine, 37 begged for food, and 7 sold their children. At that time, the following folk rhymes circulated among the masses: "Spring plowing is a season of hard work, summer sowing makes hearts panic, autumn floods turn the green to yellow, winter disasters bring desolation," "Sweat in spring, summer, and autumn, begging for food in winter."

Since cooperativization in 1955, after more than two years of arduous struggle, we have completely eradicated the roots of disaster and eliminated poverty, especially after overcoming the severe flood disaster in 1957. In 1957, the area of cultivated land flooded accounted for 94% of the total cultivated land, the most severe disaster since liberation. However, in that same year, our cooperative eradicated natural disasters, removed the label of disaster area, and the highest yield per acre reached 500 catties, with an average of 150 catties per acre. In addition, we developed some sideline production, which enabled our cooperative not only to eliminate famine but also to become a surplus grain cooperative. More than 90% of the households in the entire cooperative exceeded the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. During the Spring Festival last year, every household ate white steamed buns, pork, and dumplings, greatly improving the lives of the members. At the same time, basic construction was carried out within the agricultural cooperative. The masses sang with joy: "Melons cannot leave the vine, children cannot leave their mothers, the poor cannot leave the Communist Party," "Agricultural cooperativization, the collective strength is great, celebrating the Spring Festival in a disaster year is better than a bumper harvest year."

Now, our Yingju Agricultural Cooperative has become a solid organization that cannot be dispersed by storms, smashed by stones, or broken by iron.

Work hard for three to five years, turn northern Henan into Jiangnan

After suffering severe flooding in 1957, our cooperative's Party branch promptly put forward the action slogan: No loans, no bankruptcy, ensure self-sufficiency with three no's (no pig squealing, no human complaining, no cattle bellowing). After the slogan was put forward, in addition to rushing to plant and replant late autumn crops, the main focus was on developing sideline production. We have a principle for developing sideline production, which is not to engage in speculative business and not to rely on state loans. We rely on our own technology, our own tools, and our own raw materials to overcome the famine through self-reliance. Why do we say this? The interests of the state, the interests of the agricultural production cooperative, and the interests of the individual members are consistent. Damage to the interests of the state means damage to the interests of the cooperative and damage to the interests of the individual members. This is a very important issue in the guiding ideology of engaging in sideline production.

Based on this principle, we do not do things that are detrimental to the state. For example, the state's purchasing price for safflower (a specialty of Fengqiu County and a medicinal material) produced by our cooperative last year was 4.438 yuan per catty. Private merchants, in order to抢购safflower, raised the price to 10 or 11 yuan per catty. Some members said: "Let's sell it to private merchants!" The cooperative's Party branch and management committee insisted on not selling to private merchants and even criticized them. Another example: Last autumn, we processed 30,000 catties of cellophane noodles. The state's purchasing price was 0.27 yuan per catty, and private merchants raised the price to 1.10 yuan per catty. If we had really sold to private merchants at that time, 30,000 catties of cellophane noodles could have been sold for 30,000 yuan. However, we insisted on obeying the overall interests and sold all 30,000 catties of cellophane noodles to the state without selling even an ounce to private merchants.

Engaging in sideline production did indeed save us from the disaster of 1957. However, our cooperative's Party branch considered: Saving us this year only addresses the current disaster, but saving us next year only addresses the future disaster. This will not fundamentally eradicate the roots of disaster! Just as we were struggling with this problem, the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the principle of "prevention is more important than rescue" in the disaster areas, calling on the disaster areas to build water conservancy projects, change to planting rice fields, and carry out some basic agricultural construction to fundamentally eliminate famine. This policy greatly encouraged the cadres and masses in our cooperative, but some people could not accept it. Some cadres said: Disaster areas have focused on disaster relief every year, but this year it is prevention is more important than rescue. The lives of the masses cannot be saved, so where is the enthusiasm to engage in disaster prevention? Some people said: For generations, we have never heard that our land can grow rice. This is not a leap forward, it is reckless advance. So we launched a great debate, big airing, big contention. Is it better to suffer disasters every year or to remove the label of disaster area? Is it better to endure hardship year after year or to work hard now? Can disaster areas achieve four-five-eight? How to achieve four-five-eight? During the debate, the cooperative's Party branch mobilized the masses to do the accounting. Before 1956, because the policy of production for self-salvation was not well implemented, the state issued many relief funds, which was not enough. We also borrowed 47,000 yuan from the state. This not only affected national construction and put the cooperative in debt, but also caused another disaster the following year. After a debate, everyone understood and said: Saving us this year only addresses the current disaster, and saving us next year only addresses the future disaster. After seventy or eighty years of saving, we are getting poorer and poorer. Disaster relief is a passive approach. We must prevent disasters. Only by preventing disasters can we completely remove the label of disaster area and quickly embark on the road to prosperity. Everyone's thinking was unified, but how to prevent disasters? If this problem is not solved, it is useless to have a goal without a concrete way to achieve it! At this time, someone said: "Disaster prevention is good! But there is no way, no experience!" The cooperative's Party branch mobilized everyone to discuss it again. After a discussion, a solution emerged: To fundamentally control water and drought disasters, we must build water conservancy projects. It is useless to only build water conservancy projects. We must also improve the soil and accumulate fertilizer in order to increase yield per unit area.

With unified thinking and a clear direction, the cooperative's Party branch promptly put forward the action slogan: "Work hard for three to five years, turn northern Henan into Jiangnan, turn saline-alkali depressions into rice fields, eating rice and fish will not be difficult, a happy life for ten thousand years, the Communist Party leads for ten thousand years." "Achieve water conservancy before the wheat harvest, cross the Yellow River this year, cross the Yangtze River next year, change from annual disasters to seasonal bumper harvests, and permanently remove the label of disaster area." In terms of method, we decided to focus on prevention, start with rescue, use disaster prevention to drive disaster relief, and use disaster relief to promote disaster prevention. Under the principle of combining disaster prevention and disaster relief, we will do a good job in the overall great leap forward.

Once the masses are mobilized, you don't need to tell them to be energetic, they will be energetic! At this time, winter happened to come, the weather was freezing cold, and the cold wind pierced people's bones. Some members' hands were swollen with frostbite and cracked, but they still kept working. A member named Cui Fuzhen had swollen hands, and when I saw it, I said: "You should rest!" He said: "I won't rest, I'd rather work hard than endure hardship!" This shows that the Party's policies always represent the interests of the broad masses. As long as the policies can be grasped by the masses, they can be transformed into infinite power. After we carefully explained the benefits of prevention over rescue, the masses realized that implementing this policy was in their own interests. Therefore, in such cold weather, everyone sang and worked: "One mind, moving forward together, building canals, transforming rice fields, ensuring bumper harvests, eliminating disasters, a good life, for ten thousand years." The masses also said: "No matter how cold it is, it can't freeze the hands of our working people, no matter how cold it is, it can't cool the fiery hearts of our working people." It was this soaring spirit that set off three great upsurges. What three great upsurges? An upsurge in water conservancy construction, an upsurge in fertilizer accumulation, and an upsurge in production and disaster relief. After these three upsurges were set off, great achievements were made in just a few months. In terms of water conservancy, water conservancy was achieved by the end of the lunar year. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer accumulation per acre reached 30,000 catties, exceeding the previous four to thirteen times. In agricultural production, late autumn crops were rushed to be planted and replanted, and a bumper harvest was obtained on the flooded land, with an income of 12,300 yuan. At the same time, sideline production was developed, with an income of more than 10,000 yuan. Adding the two items together, the total income was more than 30,000 yuan, overfulfilling the disaster relief task.

Investigate, Calculate, and Make Plans

Since the comprehensive Great Leap Forward from last winter to this spring, rural work is characterized by: many projects, large tasks, small forces, and short time. Under this new situation, if there is no comprehensive planning, the work will become passive. Therefore, we must make comprehensive plans and overall arrangements, especially labor planning, which is a major issue. The way to do a good job in labor planning is to first conduct surveys and calculations, that is, to survey the tasks, then calculate the time, plan a certain amount of time for each task, and then see how much power the cooperative has, how much labor force, and how much animal power. By investigating and calculating, we determine the strength according to the task. Before the Great Leap Forward, our cooperative was not like this. At that time, we determined the task according to the strength. Now it seems that determining the task according to the strength is a passive approach and cannot give play to the enthusiasm, creativity, and ingenuity of the labor force. Why? For example, when digging a river, if you give him the task of digging five cubic meters of earth, he will only want to dig five cubic meters of earth, he won't want to dig more, and he won't be willing to use his brains. Therefore, it is passive and not suitable for the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Now, we determine the strength according to the task. For example, how many disaster relief tasks are there, how much time is needed, how much labor force, how many river digging tasks, how much time is needed, how much labor force? If there are many tasks and little strength, we still have to complete them! What to do? The masses have many solutions! One person has one brain, ten people have ten brains, find shortcuts, tap potential, and all kinds of solutions come out.

When using labor, we must also take into account the strength and weakness of the labor force and the technical expertise. For example, there is an old man named Cui, who is sixty or seventy years old and knows how to raise pigs. If we don't ask him to raise pigs and ask him to dig a river, that won't work! This not only cannot give play to his technical expertise, but also cannot give play to his enthusiasm.

How to take care of it? Those who can dig a river will dig a river, and those who can engage in sideline production will engage in sideline production. What do old men over fifty years old do? Accumulate fertilizer! Old men have three major advantages in accumulating fertilizer: First, the work is lighter, more free, and more casual. If the old man is not free, he will get angry; second, the old man has the skills to accumulate fertilizer; third, the old man is not afraid of being dirty or smelly. Young people dislike being dirty and smelly, and they won't be proactive. Therefore, our fertilizer accumulation plan is full of old men.

In addition, organize a group of mobile labor forces. Mobile labor forces do not have fixed tasks. If an agricultural cooperative does not have a mobile labor force, it often cannot achieve its plans. Why? For example, today it is stipulated that the cooperative will dig a certain amount of river, when will it be completed? How many disaster relief tasks, when will it be completed? All the labor forces are arranged, but coincidentally, tomorrow the higher authorities will ask for fifty laborers to build a highway. If we don't go, it is the task assigned to us by the higher authorities; if we go, how can our plans be completed? If we are equipped with mobile labor forces, whether we are building a bridge or building a road, we have the labor force, so let's go! In this way, the plan can be guaranteed to be achieved.

After our cooperative's labor force is planned like this, everyone's enthusiasm is really high, and they all reflect: "Cooperativization is superior, if you know how to do something, just do it, satisfied and motivated, not afraid of even climbing mountains to catch tigers." Therefore, the rational use of labor is a big issue. Rational use will boost enthusiasm and give play to proactiveness; irrational use will make it difficult to boost enthusiasm and the plan cannot be achieved.

Another issue is the planning of cadres. At the beginning, individual cadres competed to do the easy work, and pushed the difficult work onto others. They reached out for credit when achievements were made, and pushed each other away when there were shortcomings, saying, "I didn't participate in the decision!" In this way, it is difficult to make an overall leap forward. In order to solve this problem, we implemented a method of division of labor, assignment of tasks, and fixed quota management. When implementing this method, we also made appropriate division of labor based on the cadres' technical expertise, ability, and the ease and difficulty of the work. We must make sure that the work is difficult or easy, and the cadres' abilities are large or small! If he can only carry one hundred catties, and you ask him to carry one thousand catties, he can't handle it!

After the cadres are divided into labor, assigned tasks, and fixed quotas, if there is a problem in that area, we will look for the cadre in that area. For example, the Party secretary is in charge of political and ideological work. If the members' enthusiasm for production is not high and the attendance rate is low, the Party secretary is responsible. Why? Because the political and ideological work has not been done well!

In this way, with tasks, time, and requirements, every industry has a full-time job, and everything is managed by someone. The leadership is specific, and there is no chaos from top to bottom. It can not only give play to the creativity, enthusiasm, and ingenuity of each cadre, but also adapt to the complexity of various tasks. The work of an agricultural cooperative is very complex! The county people's committee is divided into seventy or eighty sections, and the county party committee is divided into many departments. The agricultural cooperative is not divided into sections or departments. The few people in the agricultural cooperative do everything. They are not divided into industries or professions. Everything must be done by the Party secretary or the head of the cooperative. That won't work! If we divide into industries and professions, whoever is in charge of what is in charge of what, and whoever should be found should be found. In this way, we can adapt to multiple tasks, otherwise we can't get started.

One Becomes Two, Two Becomes Four, Expanding Reproduction

Agricultural cooperatives must master a certain amount of economic power. Why? An agricultural cooperative is a large family with thousands of people and hundreds of households. The cooperative's Party branch and management committee are like the head of the family. They must be able to solve any problems or difficulties that anyone in the family has, especially in disaster areas, where the masses face difficulties as soon as they open their eyes. If they are not short of food, they are short of drink, or they don't have money to see a doctor and buy medicine. If we don't properly solve the difficulties of the masses in disaster areas, we cannot show the superiority of cooperativization, and we cannot make the members establish the idea of loving the cooperative as their home. The members handed over their livestock and land to the cooperative, hoping to rely on the agricultural cooperative to increase production, increase income, improve their lives, and enjoy a happy life as soon as possible! If you don't solve their problems, they won't love the cooperative. For example, if a member's wife is sick and needs to spend two yuan to buy medicine, and he doesn't have the money and takes the prescription to the head of the cooperative, hoping to borrow two yuan to take his wife to see a doctor, but the cooperative's economic power has been delegated and there is no money, the head of the cooperative can only grit his teeth and say: "There is no money, go back!" The member is heartbroken and goes home. As soon as he gets home, he will definitely say to his wife: "I gave him the land, I gave him the livestock, I gave him the farm tools. If I hadn't given them to him, wouldn't I be able to sell a cow to treat your illness?" In this way, can you ask the members to love the cooperative? They won't love it. Why don't they love it? Your cooperative has nothing that the members can love, and it cannot solve the members' difficulties. On the other hand, if the agricultural cooperative has a certain amount of economic power, and a member comes to borrow money to take his wife to see a doctor, the head of the cooperative can ask the accountant to lend him three yuan and say to him: "Take two yuan to buy medicine, and one yuan to buy some eggs and lotus root powder to nourish your wife, cure her disease, and work hard in production." When the member hears this, can he not love the cooperative? Why will he love it? Because your cooperative does have something that the members can love. You don't need to ask him to love it, he will love it anyway! In this way, the agricultural cooperative becomes a solid organization that cannot be broken by sticks or smashed by stones.

The main purpose of the cooperative mastering economic power is to develop sideline activities and expand reproduction. The method our cooperative mastered is: According to the principle of voluntary participation by the members, except for distributing six catties of grain and half a catty of cotton to each member from last autumn's agricultural income, the remaining 28,000 catties of grain, 5,000 catties of cotton, 6,800 catties of oil crops, 260,000 catties of sweet potatoes, and 200,000 catties of turnips are all uniformly mastered by the cooperative. What are they used for after being uniformly mastered? Part of it is used to arrange the members' lives through advance payment according to work, and part of it is used as raw materials and funds to expand reproduction.

How do we expand reproduction?

The first is to make sweet potatoes into powder. Last autumn, we harvested more than 260,000 catties of sweet potatoes. After explaining the reasoning to the masses, everyone didn't eat even an ounce. Except for 20,000 catties reserved for seeds, the rest were all made into powder. Making sweet potatoes into powder can solve three major problems. First, solve the food problem. After making sweet potatoes into powder, drying the residue, eating the residue, and eating the flour, one catty is equivalent to two catties. In this way, we saved 40,000 catties of grain in the entire cooperative. Second, it increased the income of the members. Without affecting the eating of sweet potato residue and flour, the sweet potato powder was made into cellophane noodles. A total of 30,000 catties of cellophane noodles were made, earning 8,100 yuan. These 8,100 yuan can buy 100,000 catties of miscellaneous grain. Our cooperative only lacks 100,000 catties of grain. Therefore, making sweet potato powder into cellophane noodles alone solved the difficulty of the entire cooperative's members in buying grain. Third, it can ensure that the sweet potatoes do not rot. In the past, the masses had a saying: "Sweet potatoes are treasures, but there is no way to deal with them when they rot." This shows that they were not well preserved in the past. Now it's different, don't be afraid of rotting, make them into powder and dry them into residue, and they can be preserved.

If these 260,000 catties of sweet potatoes are distributed to the members, they can only be eaten for 40 to 50 days. Now, after making them into powder, they can be eaten for 240 days. Therefore, it is a good way to expand reproduction and increase social wealth. This is different from other sideline productions. Other sideline productions, such as selling vegetables, do not increase social wealth. Therefore, it is not only a good way in disaster areas, but also a good way in non-disaster areas!

The second way to expand production is to make cattle feed into oil without affecting the feeding of cattle. Last year, our cooperative needed a total of 40,000 catties of cattle feed. The cooperative only had 10,000 catties of soybeans (soybeans are ordinary cattle feed in Henan), and was still short of 30,000 catties. These 30,000 catties were supplied by the state, but there was no money to buy them. What to do? We tried to find a solution in the only 10,000 catties of soybeans, expanding reproduction, and as a result, 10,000 catties of soybeans solved the difficulty of 40,000 catties of cattle feed.

How did we solve it? Processing 10,000 catties of soybeans into oil. One hundred catties of soybeans can produce eleven catties of oil, and 10,000 catties of soybeans can produce 1,100 catties of oil. These 1,100 catties of oil can be sold for about 500 yuan. Where does the livestock feed come from? Use the soybean residue left over from oil extraction to make soybean cakes to feed the cattle, which is even more effective than feeding soybeans! On this basis, the poor came up with a poor solution, expanding the production of soybean cakes, making tofu, and the remaining residue can still be used to feed cattle. One catty of soybean cake produces two catties of tofu, and 10,000 catties of soybean cake produces 20,000 catties of tofu. This time, it expanded by another 2,000 yuan. Including the oil, the total income was 2,500 yuan. These 2,500 yuan can buy 30,000 catties of grain, which solved the difficulty of 30,000 catties of livestock feed in our cooperative. Using livestock feed to expand production and then solving the problem of livestock feed, this is our poor solution.

The third way is to raise socialist pigs. In the past, our cooperative did not have the habit of raising pigs, nor did we have the experience of raising pigs. After Chairman Mao called on everyone to raise pigs, we mobilized the members to raise pigs. We mobilized for a long time, but we couldn't mobilize them. What was the reason? The members couldn't afford piglets, and even if some people could afford them, they didn't have anything to feed them. So we conducted research. After research, we found that if we want to raise pigs on a large scale, we must raise them collectively. If we raise them separately, we can't develop on a large scale. The masses don't have that much capital, and they don't have that much time. If we raise them collectively, we don't have the experience. In 1953, the primary cooperative raised 70 pigs, but after feeding them for more than two months, the piglets became thin. Upper-middle peasants mocked the cooperative, and when they passed the entrance of the primary cooperative, they all laughed and said: "The cooperative's little black pigs have turned into little black cats!" One pig weighed 54 catties when it was bought, but it weighed 46 catties after being fed. When swine fever broke out at the beginning of October, 35 pigs died, and none of the piglets were left. This was mainly due to the lack of collective pig-raising experience. This is another difficulty. If we don't raise pigs collectively, we can't develop on a large scale. If we raise pigs collectively, we don't have the experience. This contradiction was placed before us. Finally, everyone researched a transitional solution, which is to raise them while preventing deaths. The solution is: Collective operation, decentralized to households, processed feeding, fixed contracts. The specific method of fixed contracts is: Setting the cost, the cooperative invests ten yuan per pig, and five yuan for feeding; setting work points, members give the cooperative thirty workdays for raising a fattening pig, and seventy workdays for a sow, with a fixed wage of one yuan per workday. Why fix it? If it is not fixed, it will affect the members' enthusiasm for feeding; setting tasks, each fattening pig weighs 150 catties, and each sow delivers fifteen piglets per year, each weighing twelve catties; setting the time, the pigs are handed over to the cooperative once every twelve months, and the fertilizer is cleared in three plantings. Which three plantings? Spring, summer, and autumn, hand over three carts at a time, and nine carts a year; setting the technology, we are very difficult to solve the technical problems in our cooperative! There is an agricultural secondary school in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province. There is an animal husbandry department in the agricultural secondary school, which specializes in training students to learn animal husbandry technology. We asked them to help us train four technicians. These four people studied for two months and came back. At this time, the pigs raised collectively by the youth team happened to get sick. They went to take a look and said it was swine fever. After disinfection, isolation, medication, and injections, it was really effective! The pigs immediately stopped dying and all started eating. As a result, the masses supported them very much, so we set the technology, called the four of them teachers, and organized a group of people to learn with the teachers taking apprentices. Now, every fifty pigs have a fixed technician. The technology is not very high, but anyway, disinfecting and giving vaccinations can still be effective.

Now, we not only raise pigs collectively, but most of the sideline production is also done collectively. Each household just raises a few chickens and ducks. Why? We are engaged in agricultural collectivization, engaged in socialism! We cannot take the decentralized road. If we start from decentralization, and the guiding ideology has this problem, we cannot achieve collectivization and cannot achieve socialism. For example, in 1956, we engaged in sideline production. The sideline production with large income and large investment was done by the cooperative, the sideline production with small income and small investment was done by the production team, and the scattered sideline production that was not easy to control was distributed to each household. Once the written article was written, everyone followed it, but once it was implemented, there were many problems! The balance of raw materials, technology, and income, the spontaneous forces of the members, etc., gave rise to five fundamental problems.

For example, the technical problem, if the cooperative engages in sideline production, it must draw technology, labor, and tools from the team. However, the team does not allow it, saying: The prosperity of the team depends on it! We also want to do it. In this way, the cooperative cannot engage in sideline production.

As for the team, the team with technology, raw materials, and tools can do better; the team without technology and raw materials cannot do it. In this way, the team that does well has more income, and after people eat and cattle are fed, there is still a surplus; the team that does not do well not only has no surplus, but also loses money, and the income is unbalanced, which is a problem. Going further down to each household, the situation changes again. The team that does well in sideline production only engages in sideline production, and participates less in the cooperative's agricultural production, and the income from the wheat harvest is less, forming a summer famine! The team that does not do well in sideline production puts its strength in engaging in agriculture, and the income from the wheat harvest is more. In this way, the income is unbalanced again, which is all a problem!

Another point is that if sideline production is delegated to households, the members will have the power of spontaneous trends, and the cooperative cannot be consolidated! No matter when, the work of an agricultural cooperative must be done collectively. Collective work can be done better and can show the superiority of cooperativization. If each person engages in their own set, earning one yuan a day, and earning five jiao a day in the cooperative, then will he be willing to stay in the cooperative? The agricultural cooperative cannot be consolidated!

In our neighboring cooperative, in 1956, sideline production was delegated to households all at once, and each person was rescuing their own disaster and engaging in their own sideline production. The head of the cooperative and the Party secretary had nothing to do! After a discussion, they said: "Let's go engage in our own business!" As a result, the sideline production was really good, but the labor force was all engaged in sideline production, and the management of wheat was not strengthened. After a flood in the autumn, it was all over! Each workday only earned one jiao and seven fen. What to do? The head of the cooperative and the Party secretary mobilized everyone to engage in water conservancy and agriculture, but the members said: "I'd rather engage in my own sideline production! In the cooperative, I only earn one jiao and seven fen a day!" Then the cooperative will not be consolidated. This is a lesson!

The sideline production of an agricultural cooperative should be done collectively by the cooperative. The increased income is still distributed to the members! The members are not troubled and can increase their income. The members of our cooperative are now unwilling to engage in decentralized work and support collective work!

The Method of Advance Payment According to Work is Good, but I'm Afraid I'll Do Less Work

Unified use and advance payment according to work is the distribution method of an agricultural cooperative, mainly to use all economic forces uniformly and solve the members' lives through production.

The living difficulties of the masses in disaster areas are particularly great. If the difficulties are not solved, it will affect production. At the same time, after expanding reproduction and obtaining income, how to distribute the income well, so that it can comprehensively solve the members' living difficulties and meet the needs of production and construction, is a very important issue. In solving this problem, we have explored the following method: Advance payment according to work, comprehensively arranging production and life. The specific method is to conduct three surveys and three calculations, survey the disaster situation, calculate the production investment and the members' living needs; survey the various production tasks, calculate how much work is needed for each task, survey the existing economic forces, and calculate the reliable income in the future. Through the three surveys and three calculations, determine the labor advance payment standard according to needs and possibilities. With the changes in the situation, our advance payment methods have also been continuously improved over the past two years. Roughly speaking, we have adopted three forms: One is the unified average advance payment according to work, that is, an average of a few jiao per workday. Regardless of the size of the difficulties of each household, the advance payment is made according to the unified workday advance payment standard. The formula for calculating the workday advance payment standard is: The economic forces within the cooperative used for the members' lives divided by the estimated number of workdays before the wheat harvest is the workday advance payment standard. After this method was implemented for a period of time, the advantage was that it could mobilize all positive factors, but the disadvantage was that too much money was invested, the households with more labor force could not use up the advance payment, and the households with less labor force did not have enough, forming a waste of funds and weakening production investment. If the cooperative's economic forces are rich, this average advance payment method can still be adopted, but in 1957, the cooperative suffered a disaster and the economic forces were not large, so this method will not work, and it was later improved. It was changed to classified advance payment according to work, dividing the more than 200 households in the cooperative into three types according to the size of living difficulties and the strength of the labor force. Then, a representative household is selected from the three types of households to be determined as a typical household. First, set the work for him, see how many workdays this household can work in a day? Then determine the standard of living needs, see how much money he needs in a day? Divide his set work number by the required number, and the resulting number is the advance payment standard number. This advance payment standard number is the advance payment standard number for his type of household. After this method was implemented for a period of time, problems were discovered again. What problems? The boundaries between the types of households are not clear, the households with more labor force and fewer people still cannot use it up, and some households with less labor force and more people still cannot solve the problem. This method does not work again, and we mobilize everyone to study again. After everyone studies, they come up with another method, determining the advance payment standard for each household according to the living needs and the possible number of workdays of each household. The algorithm is to subtract his famine-passing potential from the household's living needs and divide it by his set work number. The resulting number is the advance payment standard number. One advance payment standard for each household, 204 households, 204 advance payment standards, each household has solved the problem, and waste has been avoided. This method is most suitable for disaster areas.

In the past two years, we have adopted these three forms, and we feel that the first and third forms are better. The first form is suitable for non-disaster areas. Disaster areas have insufficient economic forces, so it is better to adopt the third method.

In terms of advance payment time, we made advance payments once a month in 1956. As a result, the members felt that the time was too long. This shows that making advance payments once a month is not suitable for the situation in disaster areas. Although the members' awareness has been raised, realism is still unavoidable! Later, we conducted research again and changed it to making advance payments every ten days. The members used to say: "Making advance payments once a month is too long." Now they say: "The method of making advance payments every ten days is good, but I'm afraid I have little labor force." Many members secretly worked and rushed to work, and the labor efficiency increased from three cubic meters of earth per person per day to eight cubic meters of earth, and the attendance rate reached 120% to 125%. Old men and old ladies all participated. Some people worked sixteen to eighteen hours a day. When the cooperative cadres saw this, they thought: No way! What if the labor force is destroyed? They restricted them, not allowing them to start early and stay late, but they couldn't restrict them. If you don't ask him to do it, he will do it secretly. This shows that the

    我们彻底挖掉了穷根
    河南省封丘县应举农业社社长  崔希彦
    编者按：应举农业社社长崔希彦同志的这篇报告，是值得读者仔细阅读的一个报告。
    在“红旗”第一期上毛泽东同志写的“介绍一个合作社”的那篇文章，就是推荐应举农业合作社的。
    不久前，应举农业社社长崔希彦同志到北京开会，北京许多单位纷纷请他去做报告。他前后做了十三次报告，直接听到他的报告的共有三万五千多人，其中有工人、农民、机关干部、部队、学生和民主人士。
    许多人听了报告以后说道：“这是一个又红又专的马克思列宁主义的报告，是一次生动的社会主义教育。它使我们具体地看到了劳动农民的智慧和光芒。”
    这篇文章，就是根据崔希彦同志的几次报告整理的。
    我们应举农业社的土地不好，不光地形低洼，还都是盐碱地，在解放以前是“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”，上千亩土地经常颗粒不收。就是在丰收年，每亩最高产量也只有五、六十斤，许多人缺吃少穿，逃荒要饭。1942年，因遭受自然灾害，全村一百三十五户，有四十户逃荒，三十七户要饭，七户卖儿女。当时，在群众中流传着“春季起地一季忙，夏季播种心发慌，秋季水淹青变黄，冬季受灾一片凄凉”、“春夏秋三季一头汗，到了冬季去要饭”的歌谣。
    自从1955年合作化以来，我们经过二年多的艰苦奋斗，已经彻底挖掉了灾根，消灭了贫困，特别是战胜了1957年严重涝灾。1957年，水淹耕地面积占总耕地面积94％，是解放以来受灾最严重的一年；可是，也就在这一年，我们社根除了自然灾害，摘掉了灾区帽子，最高的亩产量到达五百斤，平均每亩一百五十斤，加上开展了一些副业生产，这就使我们社不仅消灭了灾荒，而且成了余粮社。全社90％以上的户超过了富裕中农的生活水平。去年春节，家家户户吃上了白馍、猪肉、饺子，大大改善了社员生活；同时，农业社内还进行了基本建设。群众欢欣鼓舞地歌唱：“瓜儿离不了秧，孩儿离不了娘，穷人离不了共产党”，“农业合作化，集体力量大，灾年过春节，赛过丰收年”。
    现在，我们应举农业社已经变成狂风暴雨吹不散，石砸不破、铁打不烂的坚实组织。
    苦战三五年，豫北变江南
    1957年遭受严重的涝灾以后，我们社的党支部及时提出了行动口号：不贷款，不破产，保证自给三不叫（猪不叫，人不叫，牛不叫）。口号提出来以后，除抢种、补种晚秋作物外，主要是开展副业生产。我们开展副业生产有个原则，这个原则就是不做投机倒把生意，不依靠国家贷款，依靠自己的技术，依靠自己的工具和原料，自力更生，战胜灾荒。为啥这样说呢？国家利益、农业生产合作社的利益、社员个人利益是一致的，国家利益受损失，就是合作社利益受损失，也是社员个人利益受损失，这是搞副业生产指导思想上一个很重要的问题。
    就凭这个原则，我们不做对于国家不利的事，比如我们社里去年生产的红花（红花是封丘县的特产，是药材）国家收购牌价是四元三角八分一斤，私商为了抢购红花，竟抬高到十元到十一元一斤，部分社员说：“卖给私商吧！”社党支部和社管理委员会坚持不卖给私商，还把私商批评了一顿。再如去年秋季，我们社加工粉条三万斤，国家收购牌价是二角七分一斤，私商又抬高到一元一角一斤，当时如果真卖给私商，三万斤粉条，就可以卖到三万元，但是，我们坚持服从整体利益，三万斤粉条，全卖给了国家，没有卖给私商一两。
    搞了副业生产，确实是救了1957年的灾，但是，我们社党支部考虑到：今年受灾今年救，明年受灾明年救，还是不能从根本上挖掉灾根呀！正在作难的时候，中共河南省委提出了在灾区贯彻“防重于救”的方针，号召灾区兴修水利，改种稻田，搞些农业基本建设，从根本上消灭灾荒。这个方针对我们社里干部和群众鼓舞很大，但是，也还有一部分人对这个方针接受不了。有的干部说：重灾区年年以搞救灾为中心，可是今年是防重于救，群众生活还救不了，那有劲头去搞防灾？有的群众说：几辈子没听说我们这里的地可以种水稻，这不是跃进，是冒进。我们就开展大鸣、大放、大辩论。辩论年年受灾好，还是摘掉灾区帽子好？年年苦熬好，还是现在苦战好？灾区是不是能够实现四五八？如何实现四五八？在辩论当中，社党支部发动群众算了一笔账：1956年以前，由于对生产自救方针贯彻得不好，国家发出许多救济款，这还不够，我们又向国家贷款四万七千元，这样，不仅影响国家建设，合作社负了债，而且第二年仍然遭了灾。一辩论，大家明白了，都说：今年受灾今年救，明年受灾明年救，救了七、八十年，越救越穷，救灾是个消极办法，一定要防灾，只有防灾，才能彻底摘掉灾区帽子，彻底挖掉穷根，很快走上富裕的道路。大家思想上通了，可是咋防法呢？这个问题不解决，有了目标，没有具体道道也不行哪！这时又有人说：“防灾是好呀！就是没办法，没经验哪！”社党支部又发动大家讨论了。一讨论，办法就出来了：要根治水旱灾害，就要兴修水利，光兴修水利没有用，还要改良土壤，搞积肥，才能提高单位面积产量。
    思想通了，道道有了，社党支部及时提出了行动口号：“苦战三、五年，豫北变江南，盐碱洼地变稻田，吃大米吃鱼不作难，幸福生活万万年，共产党领导万万年”。“麦前实现水利化，今年过黄河，明年过长江，变年年受灾为季季丰收，永远摘掉灾区帽子”。在方法上，我们确定了从防处着眼，从救处着手，以防灾带动救灾，以救灾推动防灾。在防灾救灾相结合的原则下，搞好全面跃进工作。
    群众一经发动起来以后，你不叫他有劲，他也要有劲呀！这时，正好冬天来了，天寒地冻，冷风一直刺到人的骨髓里，有的社员的手冻肿了，裂口了，还要干。有一个叫崔福珍的社员，手冻肿了，我见了说：“你休息吧！”他说：“不休息，宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬！”这说明：党的方针、政策总是代表广大群众的利益的，方针、政策只要能为群众掌握住，就能变成无穷无尽的力量，当我们认真说明防重于救的好处以后，群众认识到执行这一方针，是符合自己利益的，所以在那样冷的天气，大家唱着歌劳动：“一股劲，齐向前，修渠道，改稻田，保丰收，灭灾害，好生活，万万年。”群众还说：“天再冻，冻不了我们劳动人民的双手，天再冷，冷不了我们劳动人民火热的心。”就是这种冲天干劲，掀起了三大高潮。哪三大高潮？水利建设高潮，积肥高潮和生产救灾高潮。这三大高潮掀起来以后，在短短几个月当中，就取得了很大成绩。在水利方面，阴历年底就实现水利化了，在积肥方面，每亩积肥达三万斤，超过以往四倍到十三倍，农业生产上，抢种、补种了晚秋作物，获得了水淹地的丰收，收入一万二千三百元，同时开展了副业生产，又收入一万多元，两项加起来，共收入三万多元，超额完成了救灾任务。
        查查算算做规划
    从去冬今春，全面大跃进以来，农村工作是：项目多，任务大，力量小，时间短。在这种新情况下，如果不全面规划，工作起来，就会陷于被动。所以必须全面规划，统筹安排，特别是劳力规划，是个大问题，做好劳力规划的办法，首先是通过查算，就是查查任务，再算算时间，一项一项任务规划出一定的时间，然后看看社里有多大的力量，多少劳力？多少畜力？通过查查算算，就根据任务确定力量。大跃进前，我们社可不是这样的，那时是根据力量，确定任务，现在看起来，根据力量，确定任务是个消极办法，不能发挥劳力的积极性、创造性和钻研性。为啥呢？比如挖河吧！你给他五方土的任务，他就只想挖五方土，不想多挖了，也不肯动脑筋了。因此是消极的，不适于全面跃进的形势。现在，我们是根据任务，确定力量，如救灾多少任务，要多少时间？多少劳力，挖河多少任务？要多少时间？多少劳力？任务多，力量小，也要完成?！咋办呢？群众的办法多哩！一个群众一个脑瓜袋，十个群众十个脑瓜袋，找窍门，挖潜力，啥办法都出来了。
    在使用劳力的时候，还要照顾劳力体力强弱和技术专长，例如有一个姓崔的老头儿，六、七十岁了，会养猪，如果不叫他喂猪，叫他去挖河，那就不行呀！这不光不能发挥他的技术专长，也不能发挥他的积极性。
    如何照顾呢？能挖河的就挖河，能搞副业的搞副业。五十岁以上的老头儿干啥？积肥?！老头儿积肥有三大好处：第一、活儿轻一点儿，自由、随便一点儿，老头儿一不自由，他就恼了；第二、老头儿积肥有技术；第三、老人不怕脏、不嫌臭。青年人嫌脏嫌臭，不会积极。所以我们的积肥规划里尽是老头。
    另外，组织一部分机动劳力，机动劳力不固定任务。农业社没有机动劳力，往往不能实现计划。为啥呢？比如今天规定社里挖河多少任务？啥时完成？救灾多少任务？啥时完成？劳力统统安排进去了，可巧，明天上级来要五十个劳动力修公路，不去吧！是上级分给我们的任务；去吧！我们的计划怎能完成呀？如果配备了机动劳力，修桥也好，修路也好，有劳力，去吧！这样，规划就能保证实现。
    我们社的劳力这样一规划，大家的劲头可真大，都反映：“合作化，优越大，会弄啥，就弄啥，心满意足劲头大，上山掏虎也不怕”。所以合理使用劳力是个很大的问题，合理使用，劲头就大，就能发挥积极性；不合理使用，就很难发挥积极性，规划就不能实现。
    再有是干部规划问题，开始时，个别干部对于好做的工作争着去做，不好做的工作光朝别人身上推，搞出成绩伸手要，有了缺点互相推，说：“我可没参加意见哪！”这样，就很难全面跃进，为了解决这个问题，我们实行了分工分业定额包干管理的办法。在实行这个办法时，也是根据干部技术专长、能力大小，以及活儿轻、重、难、易进行适当分工，工作是难是易，干部能力是大是小，一定得弄清楚呀！他只能担一百斤，你给他担一千斤，就吃不住哪！
    在干部分工分业，固定包干以后，那方面出了问题，就找哪方面干部。比如支书是管政治思想工作的，啥时社员的生产情绪不高，出勤率低了，就是支书负责，为啥呢？政治思想工作没做好嘛！
    这样有任务，有时间，有要求，业业有专职，事事有人管，领导具体，上下不乱，不仅能发挥每个干部的创造性、积极性、钻研性，而且适应各种工作的复杂性。农业社的工作可复杂呀！县人民委员会分七、八十个科，县委分好多部，农业社不分科，也不分部，啥事到了农业社就这几个人做，不分行，不分业，啥事都要找支书、找社长，那可不行哪！分了行，分了业，谁管啥就管啥，该找谁就找谁。这样，就可以适应多项工作，否则就拉不开趟。
    一变二，二变四，扩大再生产
    农业社要掌握一定的经济力量，为啥呢？农业社是几千口人、几百户的大家庭，社党支部和社管理委员会好像是个一家之长，对他这个家庭里谁有点啥问题，谁有点啥困难，都要能解决，特别是灾区，群众睁开眼就有困难，不是缺吃的，就是少喝的，不然就是看病吃药没有钱。面对灾区群众的困难，如果不好好加以解决，就显示不了合作化的优越性，就不能使社员树立起爱社如家的思想，农业社就不能很好巩固。社员把牲口、土地交给合作社，是想依靠农业社，增加生产，增加收入，改善生活，早享幸福生活的呀！你没有给他解决问题，他就不爱社了。比如说：有一个社员的爱人生病了，要花两块钱买药，没有钱拿了药方来找社长，满心想借两块钱给老婆看病，可是社里经济力量下放了，没有钱，社长只有硬着头皮说：“没有钱，你回去吧！”这个社员满心难受回家转，一到家，他一定会对他的爱人说：“土地给他了，牲口也给他了，农具也给他了，如果不给他，卖了一头牛，还不是可以给你治病？”这样，你叫社员爱社，他就爱啦？！不爱的。为啥不爱呢？你这个社没有使社员可爱的地方，不能为社员解决困难。反过来农业社掌握一定的经济力量，社员来借钱给老婆看病，社长就可以叫会计借给他三块钱，对他说：“两块钱拿去买药，一块钱买点鸡蛋、藕粉给爱人调养调养，治好病，好好生产劳动。”这个社员一听，还能不爱社？为啥会爱呢？因为你这个社确实有社员可爱的地方。你不叫他爱，也不行哪！这样，农业社就成为一个棒打不烂、石砸不碎的坚实组织。
    社里掌握经济力量，主要的目的是：开展副业活动，扩大再生产。我们社里掌握的办法是：根据社员自觉自愿的原则，把去年秋季的农业收入，除分给社员每人六斤粮食和半斤棉花外，其余二万八千斤粮食，五千多斤棉花，六千八百斤油料作物，二十六万多斤红薯，二十万斤萝卜，全部由社里统一掌握起来，统一掌握起来干啥用呢？一部分通过按劳预支安排社员生活，一部分作为原料和资金，扩大了再生产。
    我们是怎样扩大再生产的呢？
    第一是把红薯打成粉，去年秋季收红薯二十六万多斤，和群众说明道理以后，大家一两也没吃，除留种子二万斤外，其余全打成粉。红薯打粉，可以解决三大问题。第一、解决粮食问题，红薯打粉晒渣以后，吃渣、吃粉面，一斤顶两斤吃。这样，我们全社节约粮食四万斤。第二、增加了社员收入，在不影响吃红薯渣和粉面的原则下，把红薯粉欠做成粉条，一共做了三万斤粉条，卖得八千一百元，这八千一百元，可买杂粮十万斤，我们社只缺十万斤粮，所以仅仅拿红薯粉欠做粉条这一项，就解决了全社社员买粮缺款的困难。第三、能保证红薯不烂，过去群众有句话：“红薯是个宝贝蛋，就是坏起来没法办，”这说明过去保存不好。现在可不同了，不怕坏了，打成粉，晒成渣，就可以保存了。
    这二十多万斤红薯，如果分给社员，只能吃四十天到五十天，现在打成粉，吃了二百四十天，所以是扩大再生产、增加社会财富的好办法。这和别的副业生产不同，别的副业生产比如卖蔬菜，是不增加社会财富的。所以它不仅在灾区是个好办法，在非灾区也是一个好办法呀！
    扩大生产的第二个办法是在不影响喂牛的原则下，把牛的饲料打成油。去年我们社一共要四万斤牛饲料，社里只有一万斤黄豆（黄豆在河南是普通的牛饲料），还缺三万斤，这三万斤由国家供给，可是没钱买，咋办呢？我们就在仅有的一万斤黄豆里想办法，把黄豆扩大再生产，结果一万斤黄豆就解决了四万斤牛料的困难。
    咋解决的呢？把一万斤黄豆加工成油，一百斤豆能打十一斤油，一万斤豆就出一千一百斤油，一千一百斤油能卖五百来块钱。牲口料哪来呢？拿榨过油的黄豆渣做成豆饼喂牛，比喂豆还顶事哩！在这个基础上，穷人又想了穷办法，把豆饼再扩大生产，做成豆腐，剩下的渣还可喂牛，一斤豆饼出二斤豆腐，一万斤豆饼出两万斤豆腐。这一家伙又扩大了两千元，连油合计在内，共收入二千五百元，这二千五百元，能买三万斤粮食，这就解决了我们社里三万斤牲口粮的困难。拿牲口粮扩大生产，再解决牲口料的问题，这就是我们的穷办法。
    第三个办法是养社会主义猪，过去，我们社没有养猪的习惯，也没有养猪的经验，毛主席号召大家养猪以后，我们就发动社员养猪，发动了很长时间，发动不起来，啥原因呢？社员买不起猪娃，有人买得起，又没啥喂。我们就进行研究，一研究，发现目前如果要大量养猪，必须集中养；分散养，不可能大发展，群众一没有那么多资金，二没有那么多时间。集体养吧！又没有经验。1953年初级社养了七十头猪，喂了两个多月，小猪瘦了，上中农光刺激社，走过初级社门口，都笑笑说：“合作社的小黑猪变成小黑猫啦！”有一只猪买来时五十四斤，喂成了四十六斤，到10月头上发生猪瘟的时候，一下死了三十五头，小猪一个也没剩。这主要由于没有集体养猪的经验。这又是一个困难，不集体养猪，不能大量发展，集体养猪，又没有经验。这个矛盾摆到了面前。最后，大家研究出一个过渡的办法，既要养，又要防止死亡。这个办法是：集体经营，分散到户，加工喂养，固定包干。固定包干的具体办法就是：定成本，每头猪由社里投资十元，饲养款五元；定工分，社员给社养一头膘猪三十个劳动日，老母猪七十个劳动日，一个劳动日的工资，固定一元，为什么固定呢？不固定，就影响社员喂养的积极性了；定任务，每个膘猪毛重一百五十斤，老母猪全年交十五个猪娃，每个十二斤重；定时间，向社里交猪是十二个月交一次，肥料是按三播交清。那三播哪？春、夏、秋三播，一次交三车，一年交九车；定技术，我们社为了解决技术问题，好作难哪！河南省新乡专区有个农业中等学校，农业中等学校里有个畜牧科，这个畜牧科，专门培养学生学习牧畜的技术。我们就请他们帮我们培养了四个技术员，这四个人学习了两个月，回来了，这时，恰好青年队集体养的猪得了病，他们去一瞧，说是猪瘟，经过消毒、隔离、用药、打针，真灵哪！猪立即停止死亡了，全都吃食了。这一来，群众对他们很拥护，我们就定技术，叫他们四个当老师，以老师带徒弟的办法，组织一批人学了。现在，每五十头猪固定一个技术员，技术不会很高，反正消消毒，打打防疫针还能管用。
    现在，我们不光集体养猪，大部分副业生产都是集体搞的，各家各户就是养几只小鸡、小鸭，为啥呢？我们是搞农业集体化，搞社会主义?！就不能走分散道路。光从分散出发，指导思想上有了这毛病，就搞不成集体化，搞不成社会主义。比如1956年我们搞副业生产，是收入大、投资大的归社里搞，收入小、投资小的归生产队搞，不便于掌握的零星副业分散给各户搞。书面文章一写，大家都照着办了，一办，问题可多啦！原料、技术、收入不平衡，社员自发势力等等，发生了五个根本性的问题。
    如技术问题，社里搞副业，必须向队里抽技术、抽劳力、抽工具，可是，队里不让抽，说是：兴队里搞?！我们也要搞了。这样，社里就搞不起来副业了。
    队里呢？这个队有技术、有原料、有工具，就搞得好些；那个队没技术，没原料，就搞不起来。这样，搞得好的队收入多，人吃牛喂用罢以后，还有余存，搞得不好的队不但没余，还要赔，收入不平衡，这就有问题了。再下去到各家各户，情况又变了，副业搞得好的队，光搞副业，参加社的农业生产就少了，麦罢收入就少，形成夏荒啦！副业搞得不好的队，力量放在搞农业上，麦罢收入就多。这样，收入又不平衡了，这都是问题呀！
    另一点，副业下放到户，社员有了自发趋势的力量，合作社就不能巩固啦！农业社工作，不管啥时候，都必须集体搞，集体搞能搞得更好，能显示出合作化的优越性，如果各人去搞自己的一套，一天收入一块，在社搞一天收入五角，那他还肯在社?？农业社就不能巩固啦！
    我们的一个邻社，1956年副业一下下放到户，各人救各人的灾，各人搞各人的副业，社长、支书没事干啦！一商量，说：“咱俩人去搞咱俩人的去吧！”结果，副业搞得真好，可是劳力都搞副业啦，麦子没有加强管理，一亩管四十来斤收，秋后一淹，好啦！一个劳动日才分一角七分钱。咋办呢？社长、支书发动大家搞水利，弄农业，可是，社员说：“我还是搞我的副业吧！在社搞，一天只弄一角七！”那社就不巩固了，这是教训哪！
    农业社搞副业，该由社集体搞，增加了收入，还是分给社员的?！社员既不麻烦，又能增加收入，我们社的社员现在都不愿分散搞，拥护集体搞啦！
    按劳预支办法好就怕自己劳动少
    统一使用，按劳预支，这是农业社的分配办法，主要是把所有经济力量，统一使用，通过生产，解决社员生活。
    灾区群众生活上的困难特别大，困难不解决，就要影响生产，同时扩大再生产，取得收入以后，如何把收入分配好，既能全面解决社员生活困难，又能满足生产建设的需要，这是一个十分重要的问题。在解决这个问题上，我们摸索了这样一个办法，就是：按劳预支，全面安排生产和生活。具体办法是进行三查三算，查灾情，算生产投资和社员生活需要；查各项生产任务，算各项任务需要多少工，查现有经济力量，算今后可靠的收入。通过三查三算，按照需要和可能，确定劳动预支标准。随着形势的变化，二年来我们的预支办法也不断改进，说起来，大约采取了三种形式：一种是按劳统一平均预支，就是一个劳动日平均几角钱，不管各户困难大小，一律按照统一的劳动日预支标准进行预支，计算劳动日预支标准的公式是：社内用于社员生活上的经济力量除麦收前预计做工数就是劳动日预支标准。这个办法执行了一个时期以后，好处是能调动一切积极因素，缺点是投下的钱过大，劳力多的户预支用不完，劳力少的户又不够用，形成了资金的浪费，削弱了生产投资。如果社里经济力量富裕，采取这个平均预支办法还可以，可是1957年社遭灾了，经济力量不大，这办法就不行了，后来就改进了。改成按劳分类预支，把社里二百多户，根据生活困难大小，劳力强弱，分成三种类型。再在三种类型户当中，抽出一户有代表性的确定为典型户，先给他定工，看他这一户一天能劳动多少劳动日？再确定生活需要标准，看他一天需要多少钱？拿他的定工数去除需要数，得出来的数就是预支标准数。这个预支标准数就是他这一类型户的预支标准数。这个办法执行了一个时期以后，又发现了问题，啥问题呢？类型户和类型户之间的界限划不清，劳力多、人口少的户还是用不了，有些劳力少、人口多的户还是不能解决问题，这办法又不行了，我们又发动大伙儿钻研。大家一钻研，又钻出了一个办法，根据各户生活需要和可能做的劳动日数，确定各户的预支标准。算法就是根据这户的生活需要减去他的度荒潜力，除他的定工数，所得出的数就是预支标准数。一户一个预支标准，二百零四户，二百零四个预支标准，户户都解决了问题，而且避免了浪费。这个办法对灾区最适用。
    二年当中，我们采取了这三种形式，感到第一和第三种较好，第一种适合于非灾区。灾区经济力量不足，采取第三种办法好。
    在预支时间上，我们在1956年是一个月预支一次，结果，社员嫌时间太长，这说明一月预支一次不适合灾区的情况，社员虽然觉悟提高了，可是现实主义还是避免不了呀！后来我们又作了研究，改成十天一预支。社员原来说：“一月预支时间长。”现在说：“十天预支办法好，就怕自己劳动力少”。好多社员偷着干活，抢着干活，劳动效率从一人一天挖三方土提高到八方土，出勤率达到120％到125％。老头儿、老太婆都参加了。有些人一天劳动十六到十八小时。社干部一看，不行哪！劳动力使毁了咋办？就限制他们，不准起早带晚，可是，限制不了，你不叫他做，他偷着做。这说明劳动预支的办法能调动一切劳力的积极性，提高出勤率。
    随着按劳预支办法的实行，灾区救济款发放办法也改变了，过去发放救济款的办法是：自报公议，三榜定案，一次评议，分期发放。这样工作量大，而且谁是救济户，谁不是救济户，真难弄哪！结果，不该救的救了，该救的反而没有救，不合理；再有是救济款不能起到支持生产的作用，随发随花，发三块花三块，发五块花五块，还有干部容易脱离群众，一发放救济款，你听吧！这个群众说：“我和他的条件一样，为啥他吃上，我吃不上？”那个群众答腔了，“他和干部是本家呀”，干部和群众脱离开来啦！干部和干部有矛盾，群众和群众有矛盾，内部矛盾可多呀！
    为了解决这个矛盾，我们改了一个办法，救济款救社不救户，包干到社，不发给各户，社里拿着救济款，投入按劳预支，一般的户，通过按劳预支，有吃、有喝、有烧，已经解决问题了，不需要救济了。
    个别真有困难需要救济的户，就由社包干救济。但是，在受灾期间不评议，因为评起来不容易合理，麦收了，没灾了，夏季预分账一算，你这户劳动了多少？过去预支了多少？夏季应该分多少？扣去过去预支的，你现在还能分多少？这样，谁是救济户，谁不是救济户，不用评，清清楚楚摆着呢！？既省时，又合理。
    不过，在确定救济户当中，也该要分析具体情况，就是不要光看他这户扣去过去预支的钱这次没有分到多少钱，就定他是救济户，还得看他为什么这次没有能分多少钱，也就是看他为什么劳动日做得这样少？这一看，问题就出来了，凡是过去积极劳动，这次分不到多少钱，仍会缺吃少穿的户，就是因为他人多，劳力少，不是劳动不积极，这就是个真正的救济户，应该救济；凡是因为不积极劳动而缺吃少穿的户，就不救济，因为他是个懒汉，懒汉越救越不劳动，越救群众越有意见。过去有个积极劳动者说：“懒汉！懒汉！政府的宝贝蛋”！这说明群众对政府救济懒汉有意见。
    那么！懒汉的问题咋解决，好解决，发动大伙儿辩论辩论?！你为啥缺吃少穿？辩论以后，懒汉的觉悟提高了，然后再帮他解决问题。怎么解决？按劳预支或从贷款当中解决，这样懒汉就会参加生产劳动了。
    有人问：救济款是不是够用哪？不够用，由农业社公益金解决，不过，今年，我们已经不要政府救济了。去年只要了五百多元，春节前后，政府给我们救济款，我们一个也没有要。
    又勤又俭过光景
    毛主席关于勤俭建国，勤俭办社的指示，是非常正确的，我们从勤俭救灾当中，更加体会到毛主席指示的正确。
    上面我说的是“勤”，下面再来说说“俭”！
    俭就是节约，去年，我们灾区的粮食供应标准是每人一年三百零五斤，平均每人每天十二两，当时就有人叫喊了“粮食不够吃哪！”我们就突出的抓住了粮食节约的工作，咋抓法呢？先是做好政治思想工作，加强对社员节约粮食的教育，使每个社员都能了解节约粮食的正确性，自觉自愿树立节约精神。
    通过政治思想教育以后，社员又提出意见了，节约粮食对国家、对合作社、对个人都有好处，这我们已经知道了，可是，光有道理，没有实际法儿也不成哪！群众分明向干部要办法了。这一要，干部给要住了，一开会，一碰头，大家都说没法儿。正在这样作难的时候，猛然想起了毛主席的教导，群众没法找干部，干部没法找群众呀！我们拿住了这个法宝，就及时召开了历年节约模范户的座谈会，到会十四人，都是老头儿、老奶奶。社干部对他们先进行了鼓励、表扬，说明节约的光荣，老头儿、老奶奶一经表扬，个个裂着嘴儿笑，把几十年的节约经验全介绍出来了，一介绍就介绍了四十多条。有一个老奶奶说：吃饭不撒饭是个很大的事情，好米、好面撒了一地，看起来是小事，凑起来就多了。一个人撒一个米，十个人十个米，中国六万万人，一天就是六万万个米，六万万个米要合几百斤呢？一个老农民介绍不要吃得太饱。他说：吃饱了就别吃，有人吃得肚皮闹青筋，还想吃，结果撑出病来，有了病，还得吃药，吃药，就要花钱。既浪费了粮食和多花了钱，又影响了身体健康，一举三不得。崔老太太介绍碗小馒小能节约，碗大馒大浪费的道理，她说：“吃饭当然是个实际问题，但是，里面也包含思想问题呀！你不信试试看，如使小碗吃饭，一顿吃三小碗嫌饱，第二天换一个一碗装三小碗的大碗，吃了一大碗，实际上饱了，可是还有个思想：昨天吃三碗，今天吃一碗，太少了，再来一碗吧！又拿来一碗，但是，吃了一半，不想吃了。为啥不想吃？实际上饱了，是个思想问题?！不想吃，怎么办？扔了吧！可惜，噎了吧！这一噎不打紧，浪费了一半。反过来试试，第一天用大碗吃饭，一顿吃两大碗，第二天换个小碗吃，四小碗也就饱了，他心里想：昨天吃两碗，今天吃四碗，行了。另外，吃吃装装也嫌麻烦，所以碗大馒大浪费，碗小馒小节约，这是我七、八十年的经验。我们把这些经验，归纳到一块儿，是八净、三不撒、三不吃、两小、一多。八净是粮食磨净，磨和磨盘扫净，罗面柜收净，和面盆要净，和面手要净，案板上要清净，吃饭碗要吃净，做饭锅要铲净；三不撒是：淘粮食不撒粮，挖面不撒面，吃饭不撒饭；三不吃是不吃剩馒剩饭，不吃过饱，不吃囫囵粮食；两小是碗小、馒小；一多是多吃盐。
    开过座谈会以后，及时把这些经验推广到群众当中去，群众一试验，顶灵，个个高兴，反映：“只要供给十二两，肚子不饥肠不响，既吃饱，又吃好，保证生产能搞好。”
    节约粮食方面，我们还采取一个办法，就是计划用粮，先紧后松，以人定量，根据各个季节农活不同，确定各个时期的吃粮标准。如去年冬天，每人每天吃四两粮食，半斤红薯渣，一两粉欠，一两粉条，半斤萝卜，这个标准吃了三十五天，群众不但吃饱了，而且吃的还不算坏。由于我们执行了先紧后松的原则，春节后，农活季节来了，我们的粮食就宽裕了，小孩、妇女每人都是十二两，精壮劳动力每人每天一斤半、一斤十两或一斤十二两。这样吃到麦里，不但没有向国家要一粒粮食，还余存了六千多斤粮。
    在其他方面，如穿衣、零花等等，也都教育社员节约。总之，百将就，千将就，百俭省，千俭省，苦战苦熬，渡过灾荒。
    在勤俭渡荒的同时，对于社员的一些合理要求，也要照顾。如去年腊八，社员说：“腊八节到，新春来了，自己搞点副业生产，赚点钱过年吧！”这说明社员思想上想过个好年。我们做了分析、研究，过个好年是群众的习惯，群众情愿平时艰苦点，可要过好年的，这是群众的合理要求，我们就抓住这个要求，制定过年计划，每一口人发七元二角钱的过年费，有了七元二角钱，大米、白面、零用钱样样都有了。公布以后，人人拥护，户户满意。
    有人问，这是不是浪费呀？七元二角钱打那儿来的？这是群众自己生产赚来的，用了七元二角，不仅满足了群众要求，而且还获得更多的利。这是怎么回事呢？还在阴历十二月初，随着过年生活的安排，我们就安排了生产，——兴修水利，号召大家积极参加兴修水利，谁的劳动日够得上七元二角钱，就发给七元二角，差一角钱少给一角，差二角少给二角，不劳动一个也不给。这就是通过生产，安排生活，从提高生产出发，改善生活！
    这一来，社员切身体会到生产对自己的好处，社里啥都给安排好了，只要劳动就行啦！谁还不劳动呢：别说青壮年全部出勤，老人、妇女、小孩也参加了，出勤率达到120％，我们原来打算在二月半完成水利化的，这下提前两个半月，到腊月二十八日就完成水利化啦！这样，花了两个钱是小，收入可大啦！这样，社员的要求达到了，过好了年，生产也搞好了。
