Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: As of this morning, in 230 large and medium-sized cities across China, 21 million people have held powerful demonstrations and marches against the armed aggression of the United States and Britain in the Middle East.

The aggressive actions of American and British imperialism in the Middle East have created a very serious and dangerous situation for world peace and human happiness. The people of China are angered by the heinous acts of the American and British aggressors in destroying peace.

Since the 17th, people in various regions have rapidly formed an unprecedented, massive protest and demonstration movement. Demonstrators put forward the strongest protests, angrily shouting slogans: "American aggressors get out of Lebanon!" "British aggressors get out of Jordan!" "American aggressors get out of Taiwan!"

In Beijing, the angry shouts of protest have not stopped for three or four days. Starting from the 17th, after holding a protest rally of 500,000 people, 2 million people took to the streets to demonstrate. The demonstrating masses sent countless letters of protest against the United States and Britain to the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires. In Shanghai, 1.7 million people demonstrated in the streets. Almost all counties and cities in Shaanxi Province held demonstrations and marches, with more than 5 million people participating. In our vast territory, from the northernmost forest city of Yichun to the southernmost island city of Haikou, from important coastal ports to the Qaidam Basin and the Pamir Plateau, groups of people are demonstrating against the American and British aggressors everywhere, showing their anger and strength.

Among the masses participating in the protests and demonstrations were workers, farmers, students, government cadres, street residents, intellectuals, Muslims, and mothers. They demanded peace and expressed their inability to sit idly by and watch the aggressors destroy peace. Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in many places also participated in the demonstrations and marches. The soldiers said: We are the defenders of peace, and we cannot allow peace to be destroyed!

Demonstrators also strongly stated that the American imperialists were driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people and were badly beaten in the Korean War, fully proving that they are a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality. People shouted: "We love peace, we are not afraid of war!"

At present, the people of the whole country are paying close attention to the development of the international situation with great concern, and are determined to take practical actions to strengthen the power to defend peace.

    新华社21日讯  到今天上午为止，在全中国的二百三十个大城市和中小城市中，有二千一百万人举行了反对美国和英国武装侵略中东的强大示威游行运动。
    美英帝国主义在中东的侵略行动，对世界和平和人类的幸福造成了十分严重和危险的局面，全中国人民为美英侵略者破坏和平的罪恶行为所激怒。
    从17日开始，各地人民迅速地形成了历史上空前未有的一次规模巨大的抗议示威运动。示威者提出了最强硬的抗议，他们愤怒地高呼口号：“美国侵略军从黎巴嫩滚出去！”“英国侵略军从约旦滚出去！”“美国侵略军从台湾滚出去！”
    在北京，愤怒的抗议呼声三四天来一直没有停止，从17日开始，这里在举行了五十万人的抗议大会之后，有二百万人到街头进行示威游行，示威的群众把无数的对美英的抗议书送到了英国代办处。在上海，有一百七十万人到街头示威。陕西省差不多所有的县市都举行了示威游行，参加的群众有五百多万人。在我们幅员广大的国土上，从极北的林区城市伊春到最南的海岛城市海口，从沿海的重要港口到柴达木盆地、帕米尔高原，到处都有成群结队的群众在向美英侵略者示威，显示他们的愤怒和力量。
    参加抗议示威的群众中有工人、农民、学生、机关干部、街道居民、知识分子、穆斯林和母亲们。他们要求和平，表示不能坐视侵略者来破坏和平。许多地方的中国人民解放军官兵也参加了示威游行，战士们说：我们是和平的保卫者，我们不能允许和平遭受破坏！
    示威者还强烈地表示，美帝国主义者被中国人民赶出了大陆，又在朝鲜战争中被打得头破血流，十足证明它是一个外强中干的纸老虎。人们高呼：“我们热爱和平，我们决不惧怕战争！”
    现在，全国人民正以密切关怀的心情注视着国际形势的发展，并且决心以实际行动来增强保卫和平的力量。
