Xinhua News Agency, July 19th – The Chinese government has lodged a severe protest with the British government regarding the British dispatch of troops to Jordan and threats against the Republic of Iraq. Huang Hua, Director of the West European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, personally delivered the protest to British Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Wen Yusheng, on the morning of the 19th. The full text of the protest is as follows:

    Protest of the Government of the People’s Republic of China to the Government of the United Kingdom

    On July 17th, following the United States’ armed intervention in Lebanon, the British government, fabricating absurd excuses, openly dispatched troops to Jordan to suppress the Jordanian people and simultaneously amassed troops in the Eastern Mediterranean and Persian Gulf regions, attempting to invade the Republic of Iraq from several directions. These actions by the British government have exacerbated the world's tense situation and brought about a grave danger of expanded war. This is a blatant act of aggression by the British government, together with the U.S. government, against all Arab peoples, an open provocation against all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world, and a serious threat to world peace. The Chinese government and the Chinese people strongly condemn and protest against this provocative act of aggression and war by the British government.

    The British government's dispatch of troops to Jordan, under the pretext of helping the Jordanian government resist aggression and stabilize the situation, is completely unreasonable, as there is no aggression against Jordan whatsoever, and the situation within Jordan is entirely the business of the Jordanian people themselves. The affairs of Jordan should be managed by the Jordanian people themselves, and the affairs of Arab countries should be managed by the people of the Arab countries themselves. No foreign country can interfere. The British war provocations of invading Jordan and threatening the Republic of Iraq are not only opposed by the Arab peoples but also will never be tolerated by peace-loving countries and peoples all over the world.

    The Chinese government deems it necessary to warn the British government that it must immediately cease its armed aggression against Jordan and immediately withdraw all its armed forces from Jordan, and it must immediately cease its provocative acts of amassing troops around the Republic of Iraq. If the British government is obstinate and ignores the just condemnation and reasonable demands of the people of the world, and stubbornly refuses to cease its acts of aggression and abandon its plans for aggression, it will inevitably lead to extremely serious consequences.

    我国政府严重警告英国政府
    不准侵略约旦　不准威胁伊拉克
    如不停止侵略行为，爱好和平的人民绝不会袖手旁观
    新华社19日讯　中国政府就英国出兵约旦、威胁伊拉克共和国事，向英国政府提出严重抗议。外交部西欧司黄华司长于19日晨将上述抗议面交英国驻我国代办文郁生。抗议全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府对英国政府的抗议
    7月17日，英国政府继美国武装干涉黎巴嫩之后，捏造荒谬借口，公然出兵约旦，镇压约旦人民，并同时在东地中海和波斯湾地区集结军队，企图从几个方面侵略伊拉克共和国。英国的这些行动，加剧了世界紧张局势，带来了扩大战争的严重危险。这是英国政府同美国政府一起对全体阿拉伯人民明目张胆的侵略，是对全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的公开挑衅，是对世界和平的严重威胁。中国政府和中国人民强烈地谴责和抗议英国政府这种侵略和战争的挑衅行为。
    英国政府出兵约旦、借口要帮助约旦政府抵抗侵略、稳定局势，这是完全没有道理的，因为根本不存在对约旦的侵略，约旦国内的局势完全是约旦人民自己的事。约旦的事务应该由约旦人民自己来管，阿拉伯各国的事务应该由阿拉伯各国人民自己来管，任何外国不能干涉。英国侵略约旦和威胁伊拉克共和国的战争挑衅行为，不但为阿拉伯各国人民所反对，而且全世界爱好和平的国家和人民也绝不会对此袖手旁观。
    中国政府认为有必要向英国政府提出警告，英国政府必须立即停止对约旦的武装侵略并立即从约旦撤出一切武装力量，必须立即停止在伊拉克共和国周围集结军队的挑衅行为。如果英国政府执迷不悟，无视全世界人民的正义谴责和合理要求，坚不停止其侵略行为，坚不放弃其侵略计划，必将引起极端严重的后果。1958年7月18日于北京
