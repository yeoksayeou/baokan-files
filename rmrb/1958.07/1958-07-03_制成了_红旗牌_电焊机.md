    "Red Flag" Brand Electric Welder Manufactured
    After studying the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our workshop became even more motivated. We wanted to emulate the spirit of the Changxindian Locomotive Repair Factory in trial-manufacturing locomotives, and trial-manufacture electric welders in our repair section. After our plan was discussed and approved at a symposium on the morning of June 6th, everyone proposed: guarantee five days and nights of hard work to successfully trial-manufacture an electric welder.
    Manufacturing an electric welder requires magnets, which could not be bought outside. We found a discarded transformer in the factory, disassembled it, and pieced together the broken magnets inside to make the magnetic core of the electric welder. The electric welder requires flat copper wire, which was not readily available in the factory. We repaired an old rolling mill and pressed it ourselves. The next day, the electricians rolled flat copper wire all day, and at night, they, along with fitter Wang Zhentang and six or seven others, trimmed the magnets. When they were sleepy, they splashed a basin of cold water on their heads and continued working until noon on the 8th before going back to rest. Liu Yulin's group rushed to make the electric welder's casing overnight, and the lathe operator group made all the parts in one night. Through everyone's hard work, an electric welder was successfully trial-manufactured on schedule. We decided to name it the "Red Flag" brand electric welder. In the future, we must hold high the red flag and continue to advance.

    制成了“红旗牌”电焊机
    我们车间在学习了党的建设社会主义总路线之后，干劲就更大了。我们也要像长辛店机车修理厂试制机车的干劲一样，在我们修理工段试制电焊机。当我们的计划在6月6日早上的一个座谈会上讨论通过后，大家就提出：保证苦战五昼夜，试制成功电焊机。
    制造电焊机要用磁铁，外边买不到，我们就在厂内找到了一台废变压器，拆开来把里边的碎磁铁拼在一起，做成了电焊机的磁心。电焊机上要用扁铜线，厂内没有现成的，我们就把一台旧轧线机修理好，自己动手压制。第二天，电工同志轧了一天扁铜线，夜里又和钳工王振堂等六、七个人裁剪磁铁，困了就打一盆冷水浇浇头，再接着干，直到8日中午才回去休息。刘玉林小组连夜赶制电焊机的箱子，车工小组用一个晚上就把全部零件做好了。经过大家这样的苦战，一台电焊机按期试制成功了。我们决定把它命名为“红旗”牌电焊机。今后我们一定要高举着红旗，继续不断地前进。	　石景山钢铁厂炼焦部修理工段　张兴隆
