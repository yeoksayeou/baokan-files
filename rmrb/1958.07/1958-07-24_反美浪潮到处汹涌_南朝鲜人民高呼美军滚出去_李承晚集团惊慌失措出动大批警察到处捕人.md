Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd: Seoul Dispatch: The South Korean people's voices opposing the establishment of missile bases by American aggressors in South Korea and demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops from South Korea are rising day by day. On the evening of the 20th, leaflets demanding the withdrawal of American troops appeared in several areas of Seoul. These mimeographed leaflets read: "American imperialist troops with atomic weapons get out of Korea immediately!", "Workers and peasants unite to fight." The leaflets were distributed near the headquarters of the US occupation army's Eighth Army, in front of the American embassy's institutions and the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper office, and in places most frequented by citizens. These leaflets were distributed under heavily guarded conditions after the Syngman Rhee puppet police authorities announced an "emergency martial law" from the 18th.
