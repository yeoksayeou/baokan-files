    "Traditional Enthusiasm"
    According to a report in the London "Times," twenty-one officials from the U.S. State Department's Office of Foreign Buildings Operations are currently in Africa for a three-month so-called "study tour." According to a statement from the State Department, the purpose of this "study tour" is "to broadly understand the problems and peoples of sub-Saharan Africa with the traditional enthusiasm of the United States."
    However, the U.S. State Department did not explain what "traditional American enthusiasm" is.
    The United States has already shown a high degree of "enthusiasm" for Africa. Since World War II, American monopoly capital has poured into Africa and has already controlled the uranium and cobalt mines that account for the largest share of world production. It is currently actively penetrating the oil and non-ferrous metal sectors, intensifying the squeezing out of its British and French allies.
    As for the issue of "concern" for black people, the U.S. government implements a policy of racial discrimination against black people at home, and the Ku Klux Klan, with the connivance of the government, constantly persecutes and kills black people. All of this makes it even clearer to the African people what the true meaning of the so-called "traditional American enthusiasm" and the so-called "understanding of the problems and peoples of sub-Saharan Africa" really are.

### “传统的热情”

    “传统的热情”
    据伦敦“泰晤士报”报道，美国国务院驻外机关事务处的二十一名官员，目前正在非洲作为期三个月的所谓“研究性旅行”，根据国务院的一项声明说，这次“研究性旅行”的目的，就是“本着美国传统的热情，来广泛地了解撒哈拉以南非洲的问题和民族”。
    但是，美国国务院并没有解释什么是“美国传统的热情”。
    美国对非洲已经表现了很高的“热情”，从第二次世界大战以来，美国的垄断资本即源源涌入非洲，并且已经控制了非洲占世界产量最大部分的铀矿和钴矿，目前正在积极渗入石油和有色金属部门，加紧排挤它的英法盟国。
    至于说到对待黑人的“关心”问题，美国政府在国内对黑人施行种族歧视政策，三K党在政府的纵容下对黑人不断进行迫害和虐杀。凡此种种，是更能使非洲人民清楚地认识到所谓“美国传统的热情”，所谓“了解撒哈拉以南非洲的问题和民族”的真正含义到底是些什么东西。
