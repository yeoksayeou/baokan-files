    Notes
    Futile Hope
    The British "Daily Express" places great hope in De Gaulle's Algerian policy. The newspaper wrote: "If De Gaulle succeeds, it will not only be a victory for France, but also a victory for the very concept of the progress and liberation mission of colonial countries."
    On the issue of colonialism, Britain and France are truly brothers in distress. How to save the collapse of the colonial empire is a common problem faced by these two old colonial powers. Therefore, when De Gaulle used beautiful words such as "equality" and "fraternity" in Algeria to promote the policy of annexation, the British "Daily Express" couldn't help but pray for his success, so that moribund colonialism could find a elixir of life.
    However, De Gaulle's Algerian policy cannot cure the incurable disease of the French colonial empire. The Algerian people have not been deceived by De Gaulle's rhetoric, and they are strengthening their struggle for independence. This struggle once caused De Gaulle's predecessors to suffer heavy losses, and De Gaulle will not escape this fate either. The "Daily Express"'s hope in De Gaulle is bound to be in vain.
    The True Colors of a Slave
    On July 4th, Philippine Vice President Macapagal, at a luncheon held by the Manila Rotary Club, clamored to emphasize the acceleration of dependence on the United States. He also attacked Philippine President Garcia, saying that he had "anti-American actions." What was the basis for this? It is said that Garcia once shouted "Asia belongs to Asians." Macapagal expressed his deep disgust for this point.
    Whether Garcia himself and the government he leads have ever had "anti-American actions" is besides the point; what motives Garcia had for shouting "Asia belongs to Asians" is also worthy of scrutiny. However, Macapagal's disgust for the phrase "Asia belongs to Asians" reveals his true colors as a slave. In Macapagal's view, there is only one interest in the world, and that is the interest of his American masters. Not only should he shout "The Philippines belongs to Americans," but he should also shout "Asia belongs to Americans" to be considered forceful enough, otherwise it is an "anti-American action." Macapagal's logic, to put it bluntly, is nothing more than that.

    札记
    徒然的希望
    英国“每日快报”对戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策寄予颇大的希望。这家报纸写道：“如果戴高乐取得成功，不仅对法国来说是一个胜利，而且对殖民主义国家的进步和解放使命这一概念本身也是一个胜利。”
    在殖民主义问题上，英国和法国真是一对难兄难弟。怎样挽救殖民帝国的瓦解，是这两个老牌殖民主义国家面临的共同难题。因此，当戴高乐在阿尔及利亚用“平等”“友爱”这种漂亮话来推行吞并政策的时候，英国的“每日快报”就情不自禁地祷告一番，希望他能取得成功，好使气息奄奄的殖民主义找到一剂起死回生的灵药。
    但是，戴高乐的阿尔及利亚政策并不能治愈法兰西殖民帝国的已入膏肓之疾。阿尔及利亚人民没有被戴高乐的花言巧语所骗过，他们正在加强争取独立的斗争。这种斗争曾经使戴高乐的前任碰得头破血流，戴高乐也逃不过这种遭遇。“每日快报”把希望寄托在戴高乐身上肯定是要落空的。
    奴才本色
    7月4日，菲律宾副总统马卡帕格在马尼拉扶轮社举行的午餐会上，大喊大叫地强调加紧依赖美国。他并且攻击菲律宾总统加西亚，说他有“反美行动”。何以为凭呢？据说，加西亚曾经喊过“亚洲属于亚洲人”。马卡帕格对于这一点表示深恶痛绝。
    加西亚本人和他领导的政府是否有过“反美行动”，姑且不论；加西亚基于什么动机喊过“亚洲属于亚洲人”，也大值得推敲。不过，马卡帕格如此厌恶“亚洲属于亚洲人”这一句话，却暴露出他的奴才本色来。在马卡帕格看来，世界上只有一种利益，那就是他的美国主子的利益，不仅应该喊“菲律宾属于美国人”，而且更应该喊“亚洲属于美国人”才算够劲，否则就是“反美行动”。马卡帕格的逻辑，说穿了，如此而已。
