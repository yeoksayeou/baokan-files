Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th. Zhang Guangyi, a special researcher at the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, recently founded a Scientific and Technological Research Institute in his hometown, Wencun Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province. This research institute was established on the basis of the local existing Water Conservancy Institute, Hongzhuan School, and Women's Institute. It is divided into four research groups: science and technology, model trial production, soil engineering, and ironwork, absorbing twenty-six experienced old farmers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and young technicians to participate. The township party committee has established a Scientific and Technological Revolution Committee to lead the research institute. Zhang Guangyi serves as the president. The working characteristic of this institute is the combination of theoretical learning and technical operation, the combination of model making and physical experiments, finding tricks and experiences from a scientific and technical perspective, and immediately summarizing and popularizing the results so that they can be mastered by the masses and promote overall production.
    Currently, the researchers at this Scientific and Technological Research Institute are studying various agricultural machinery such as cement pulverizers, corn threshers, peanut shellers, rice threshers, chaff cutters, feed pulverizers, and water lifting tools. Zhang Guangyi has already successfully drawn the blueprint for the cement pulverizer in the past two days. After the successful creation of this cement pulverizer, operating it with two or three people a day can抵得上 (be equivalent to) the labor of ten millstones, thirty livestock, and twenty-five people a day.

    文村乡办了一所科学技术研究院
    新华社郑州10日电  中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所特约研究员张广义，最近在他的家乡——河南省登封县文村乡创办了一所科学技术研究院。这个研究院是在当地原有的水利学院、红专学校和妇女学院的基础上建立起来的，分科学技术、模型试制、土工、铁工等四个研究组，吸收了二十六名富有生产经验的老农、木匠、铁匠和青年技术员参加。乡党委已成立科学技术革命委员会来领导这个研究院。张广义担任院长。这个院的工作特点是理论学习和技术操作相结合，做模型和实物试验相结合，从科学上技术上找窍门，找经验，一有成果马上总结推广，使它为群众所掌握，推动整个生产。
    现在这个科学技术研究院的研究员们正在研究水泥粉碎机、玉米脱粒机、花生脱壳机，打稻机、铡草机、饲料粉碎机以及提水工具等许多种农业机械。张广义在最近两天的时间内已将水泥粉碎机的图样绘制成功。这种水泥粉碎机创造成功后，每天用两、三人操作，就可以抵上十盘碾、三十个牲畜、二十五人一天的劳动量。
