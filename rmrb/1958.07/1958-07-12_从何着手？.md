Where to Start?
　　Lin Jian
　　Today, this newspaper published news about the vigorous development of fast-growing, high-yielding timber tree campaigns in Guizhou, Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other regions. This marks another significant advancement in the nationwide greening movement.
　　Currently, China's socialist construction is experiencing a period of rapid development. Many construction projects and units require a timely supply of sufficient timber and other forest products. Can forestry production adapt to the demands of this new situation and advance at an unprecedented pace? The answer is affirmative. The numerous examples of rapid timber growth and high yields discovered in various regions serve as the best proof. As long as we actively promote these fast-growing, high-yielding experiences according to local conditions, fully unleash the revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit of diligent study of the broad masses, and launch a mass movement for fast-growing, high-yielding timber trees, we will soon obtain several or even dozens of times more timber and forest products than we do now. Take Chinese fir, for example. Under past cultivation conditions, Chinese fir typically took twenty to twenty-five years to mature. If this is advanced to ten years or slightly longer, with yields reaching forty, fifty, or seventy cubic meters per mu, China's timber resources will rapidly transform from insufficient to abundant. Furthermore, if camellia oleifera can achieve yields of fifty, one hundred, or even more jin of oil per mu, China's edible oil supply will greatly improve.
　　Based on existing experience, the first step in launching a fast-growing, high-yielding timber tree campaign is to prioritize politics, deeply propagate and implement the General Line, break down superstitions, liberate thinking, fully unleash the communist spirit of the masses, summon up great vigor, and strive for early timber maturity and high yields. When high-yield examples are discovered in various regions, they should be immediately summarized and promoted on a large scale using on-site meetings, visits, and other forms. Secondly, it is necessary to carry out a series of production tasks in a down-to-earth manner, according to the characteristics of forestry production. These tasks include seed selection and seedling cultivation, deep plowing and land preparation, and timely planting. In terms of young forest tending, it is essential to diligently carry out weeding, soil loosening, pruning, and pest and disease control, as well as necessary fertilization and irrigation. In short, the unity of politics and technology, and the combination of leadership and the masses, are the keys to carrying out the fast-growing, high-yielding timber tree campaign.
　　Are there any obstacles to launching such a mass movement in forestry production? The main obstacle is ideological. Some people do not believe that timber trees can mature several years earlier or achieve high yields. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about the creativity of the masses and do not actively discover and summarize the typical experiences of high yields. They say that, based on historical experience, Chinese fir takes at least twenty years to mature, and this is a "natural law"! However, to those who have broken down superstitions, the maturity of Chinese fir is not destined to take twenty or twenty-odd years. People cannot "pull up seedlings to help them grow," but they can shorten the maturity period of trees by carefully cultivating them in accordance with the true laws of nature. In the past, Chinese fir generally took at least twenty years to mature, which is a fact, but that was the growth rate of trees during the period of individual management. As long as one is willing to put in the effort, ensure that the trees are planted well, and pay constant attention to tending, the growth rate of trees will definitely accelerate, as has been proven by many recent examples. There is also a kind of "laissez-faire theory" in forestry production, which holds that once trees are planted, they should be allowed to grow on their own, and that tending and management seem superfluous. They do not understand that if young forests are not carefully tended after afforestation, there is no guarantee that the trees will even survive, let alone mature several years earlier or achieve high yields! Some people acknowledge the importance of young forest tending and management, but use the excuse of insufficient labor to avoid actively carrying out this work. This is a kind of passive and fearful mentality. During the vigorous production leap forward, labor is always tight. The question is whether or not to take overall considerations into account and make comprehensive arrangements. So many trees were planted in the first half of the year, and the labor problem was still solvable. Why can't the labor problem required for young forest tending be solved now? To carry out the fast-growing, high-yielding timber tree campaign, it is essential to seriously address the above-mentioned ideological problems. We believe that, driven by the mass movement and educated by the facts, comrades with the above-mentioned conservative ideas will definitely liberate their thinking, break through the confines of outdated rules and regulations, summon up great vigor, and become an active force in the fast-growing, high-yielding timber tree campaign!

    从何着手？
    林建
    今天本报发表了贵州、湖南、福建、浙江等地开展林木速生高额丰产运动的消息，这是全民绿化运动的又一个重要发展。
    目前我国社会主义建设正处在一日千里的高速度发展的时期，很多建设事业、建设单位要求及时地供应足够的木材和其他林产品。林业生产能不能适应新形势的要求，以从来未有的高速度向前发展呢？答复是肯定的。各地发现的许多林木迅速成材和高额丰产的典型，就是最好的证明。只要我们把这些速生高额丰产经验因地制宜地积极地推广起来，充分发扬广大群众的革命干劲和钻劲，掀起一个群众性的林木速生高额丰产运动，不久的将来，我们就会取得比现在多几倍、十几倍的木材和林产品。就拿杉木来说吧，在过去的栽培条件下，杉木一般要二十至二十五年成材，如果都提早到十年或稍多一些时间成材，亩产木材达到四十、五十、七十立方公尺，我国的木材资原就会迅速由不足变为富裕。再拿油茶来说，如果油茶都能达到亩产油五十斤、一百斤或更多一些的话，我国食油供应状况将得到很大的改善。
    从现有经验看，开展林木速生高额丰产运动，首先要政治挂帅，深入宣传贯彻总路线，破除迷信，解放思想，充分发扬群众的共产主义精神，鼓足干劲，力争林木提早成材和高额丰收。各地发现丰产典型，应当立即加以总结，并运用现场会议、参观等形式，大规模地推广。其次，要按照林业生产的特点，踏踏实实地做好一系列的生产工作。这些工作包括选种育苗、深耕整地、及时栽种等；在幼林抚育方面，要认真进行除草、松土、整枝、防治病虫害，并进行必要的施肥、灌溉等。总之，政治与技术统一，领导与群众结合，是开展林木速生高额丰产运动的关键。
    在林业生产上开展这样一个群众性运动，有没有什么障碍呢？主要障碍是思想问题。有些人不相信林木可以提前若干年成材，可以高额丰产，因此他们对群众的创造不热心，不去积极发现和总结高额丰产的典型经验。他们说，根据历史的经验，杉木至少要二十年才能成材，这是“自然规律”呀！然而在破除了迷信的人们看来，杉木成材并不是注定要二十年或二十几年。人们对于树木不能“拔苗助长”，但是可以按照真正的自然规律，精心培育，缩短树木的成材年限。过去杉木成材一般至少要二十年，这是事实，但那是个体经营时期的树木生长速度。只要肯下工夫，保证把树栽好，并且经常注意抚育，树木生长速度一定能加快，这已由最近发现的许多典型事例所证明。在林业生产上还有一种“自流论”，认为树已栽上，就让它自己生长吧，进行抚育管理似乎是多余的。他们不懂得，造林之后不认真抚育，树木连成活都没有保证，更谈不上林木提早几年成材和高额丰产了！有些人承认幼林抚育管理的重要，但借口劳力不足，不去积极开展这项工作。这是一种消极畏难情绪。在轰轰烈烈的生产跃进中，劳力总是紧张的，问题在于是否统筹兼顾，全面安排。上半年造林那么多，劳力问题尚可解决，为什么现在幼林抚育所需劳力的问题就不能解决呢？要开展林木速生高额丰产运动，必须认真解决上述思想问题。我们相信，在群众运动的推动下，在事实的教育下，有上述保守思想的同志，一定会解放思想，冲破陈规旧律的圈子，鼓足干劲，成为林木速生高额丰产运动中的积极力量！
