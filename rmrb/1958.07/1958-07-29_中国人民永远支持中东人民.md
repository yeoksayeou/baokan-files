    The Chinese People Will Always Support the People of the Middle East
    If the enemy dares to act rashly, beat them down so they can never get up again!
    We are mechanical and electrical workers. Now that we have become the masters of our own country and our own destiny, every drop of our sweat and every innovation is closely related to our beautiful ideals and life. We cherish our labor, we demand to produce in a peaceful environment, and we abhor war. Precisely because of this, we are particularly concerned about the fate of world peace, and we are particularly determined to oppose the colonialists' shameless armed intervention in the Middle East. Their intervention seriously undermines the peaceful environment needed for our labor. Who can guarantee that their playing with fire will not trigger a larger explosion? Therefore, when we record our growing production achievements every day, we will never forget everything that is happening in the Middle East.
    The facts that the imperialists have been beaten in China, Korea, Vietnam, and Egypt prove that they always want to enslave others, but the result is always being driven out by the awakened people and always suffering defeats. Their failure is "inevitable," and this time will be no exception.
    Arab brothers, justice is on your side, and victory is on your side. We and all peace-loving people in the world stand firmly with you. If the enemy dares to launch a war, we will make them fall and never get up again!
                          All employees of Suzhou Jinchang Mechanical and Electrical Factory
    Imperialists should recognize the times and get out of the Middle East as soon as possible!
    We, historical science workers, express our greatest indignation at the shameful behavior of the US and British imperialists in armed aggression against Arab countries and lodge a solemn protest.
    In recent years, the heroic Arab people have achieved one victory after another in their struggle against imperialism and for national independence. However, the imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. For the sake of their sordid colonial interests, after exhausting all kinds of conspiracies and tricks, they have brazenly taken armed aggression to openly attack the Arab people. This act of aggression seriously threatens peace in the Middle East and the world. We, the Chinese people, cannot sit idly by. We cannot but lodge a serious protest and warning against this bloody adventurous action by the US and British imperialists!
    As historical science workers, we find it necessary to once again emphasize the characteristics of modern history: this is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the era when the national independence movement has achieved a decisive victory, and the era when imperialism is dying out. The era of colonialism is gone forever. It is absolutely impossible for the imperialists to continue to enslave the people of other countries with swords and fire. The torrent of national independence and national liberation movements has been surging for nearly half a century and cannot be stopped by a small number of monopoly capitalists! The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in 1953 in resisting the US-led aggression against Korea, and the great victory of the Egyptian people in 1956 in resisting the British and French aggressors, vividly and accurately illustrate the characteristics of our times!
    We firmly support the successive statements of our government and the Soviet government against the US and British armed aggression in the Middle East. The US and British aggressor troops must immediately get out of Lebanon, Jordan, and Libya. Victory will surely belong to the Arab people who are fighting for national independence!

                        The Second Institute of History, Chinese Academy of Sciences

                      Chen Yuan, Hou Wailu, Yin Da, and 31 others
          We Will Definitely Fight to the End!
    We angrily protest against the US and British imperialist armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan. We are very clear that the US and British imperialist aggression plan is not only directed at the people of Lebanon and Jordan, but also at the Republic of Iraq, the United Arab Republic, the entire Middle East people, and is also a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world.
    We, the Chinese people, suffered from imperialist aggression in the past. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we went through years of bloody struggle to achieve liberation and become masters of our own land. Now, we are following the Party's general line, going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and we want to catch up with and surpass Britain at the fastest speed. However, if the imperialists dare to carry out war adventures, all the people in our township will definitely unite with the people of the whole country and the world to fight to the end to defend world peace and oppose imperialist aggression.
    We represent more than 6,000 people in Shilong Township and are determined to implement the general line and enhance the strength to defend peace with practical actions such as doubling the per-mu grain yield this year compared to last year, reaching 1,000 catties per person, and establishing factories in every cooperative, with a total of 65 factories in the township.
                            All cadres of Shilong Township, Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province
              Severely打击侵略者 (Severely Strike the Aggressors)
    The arrogant actions of US and British imperialism in armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan once again nakedly exposed the ugly faces of the aggressors. We, along with the people of the whole country and peace-loving people all over the world, firmly support the just struggle of the Arab people, oppose US and British armed intervention in the Middle East, and demand that the aggressors get out of Lebanon and Jordan!
    We are determined to support our friends in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, and all Arab countries with practical actions. We will learn from the advanced experiences of various places through visits, bring them to our practical work, accelerate socialist construction, and do everything possible to safeguard world peace!
    Friends from Iraq and Lebanon, we stand firmly with you.
    Cut off the aggressors' claws! US and British imperialists get out of the Middle East!

            Lies Cannot Deceive the People
    After watching the deceptive speech made by the American warmonger Eisenhower to the American people on the 15th of this month, it aroused our incomparable anger.
    Eisenhower shamelessly obliterated the truth, confused right and wrong, quibbled and denied, in order to deceive the American people and cover up the essence of his aggression. We cannot help but ask the aggressors, is it permissible to run amok and commit murder and arson in foreign territories tens of thousands of miles away for the sake of "American welfare"? Obviously, this "American welfare" is to maintain the bloody interests of the monopoly capitalist giants.
    The territory of Lebanon was originally complete, and the US government's armed intervention in Lebanon precisely proves that the US is the culprit for destroying Lebanon's territorial integrity.
    We want to tell Eisenhower that all despicable acts of deceiving the people cannot succeed. Facts speak louder than sophistry, and pirate-like logic cannot cover up one's crimes or find any way out.
    We are convinced that these lies cannot deceive the American people. Even more so, it cannot deceive peace-loving people all over the world. It can only arouse greater anger and resolutely rise up to fight against imperialism.

                          Wang Genzhong, Zi Yaohua, Li Wenjie, and 46 others
        Imperialism Can No Longer Arbitrarily Manipulate the People
    We feel extremely angry about the US and British imperialist armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, threatening the Republic of Iraq, and creating a war crisis. The era in which imperialism arbitrarily manipulated and enslaved the people is gone forever. Now, imperialism is still ignorant of the times and puts on a ferocious face to run amok, but it cannot scare people, and it is destined to fail.
    We Catholics are very familiar with the ferocious faces of imperialism and have personally tasted the bitterness of imperialist rule. Precisely because of this, we feel even more the hatefulness of imperialism and the preciousness of independence and autonomy. At the same time, we extend infinite sympathy and enthusiastic support to those who are fighting to get rid of imperialist trampling. We firmly protest against this act of aggression by US and British imperialism and firmly demand that they quickly withdraw from the Middle East.
    We want to run the church independently and autonomously, and thoroughly eliminate the toxins left by imperialism. We want to strive to achieve 1,000 workdays this year, buy more local public bonds, and donate more scrap copper and iron. We want to use these practical actions to support the socialist construction of the motherland and support the struggle of the people in the Middle East.
                          All clergy of the Catholic Church in Yuci City, Shanxi Province
              Our Battle
    We, a group of newspaper promotion personnel in Guangzhou, express our great anger at the crazy pirate behavior of Britain and the United States! We want to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism. We want to enable the broad masses of people to see the ferocious faces of British and American imperialism in time, and we want to enable the broad masses of people to quickly know the actions taken by the people of the world to stop British and American aggression. Therefore, we are determined to do a better job in newspaper promotion, and deliver party newspapers to the broad masses of readers earlier and more widely.
    We have greatly expanded the ranks of evening newspaper retailers and mobilized all the manpower that can be mobilized. Like participating in a battle, we are on standby before the newspaper is issued. As soon as the newspaper arrives, we rush to the roads, intersections, streets, alleys, and corners. We shout and sell loudly, and we publicize loudly. When we see people's angry expressions when reading the newspaper and their determination to drive the aggressors out of the Middle East, we are even more determined and confident to fight against the US and British aggressors: we must defeat US and British imperialism!
                          Yonghan North Road Newspaper Outlet, Guangzhou Post Office
        We Will Never Allow Jackals to Devour the People
    We, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, drove out imperialism from the land of our motherland, crushed the reactionary rule at home, and gained liberation. Today, under the guidance of the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the people of our country are leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years," creating a happy life with our own hands. The US and British imperialists, disregarding the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world, openly sent troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, which cannot but make us particularly angry. However, we want to tell the US and British aggressors that today is already the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, the era when the people of the world have awakened and want to control their own destiny. We, the Chinese people who have stood up and have the power to subdue dragons and tigers, will never allow jackals to devour the people of Lebanon and Jordan! This shameful and insane act of aggression by US and British imperialism will inevitably be met with resolute resistance in the face of the righteous people, and will suffer a shameful failure!

### 中国人民永远支持中东人民

专栏：读者来信

    中国人民永远支持中东人民
    敌人胆敢妄动，就把他们打得永远爬不起来！
    我们是机械工人和电机工人，在我们已经成为自己国家和自己命运的主人的今天，我们的每一滴汗和每一项革新，都与我们美好的理想和生活息息相关。我们珍视自己的劳动，我们要求在和平的环境里进行生产，我们厌恶战争。正因如此，我们才特别关心世界和平的命运，我们才特别坚决地反对殖民主义者对中东的无耻的武装干涉。他们这种干涉行动严重地破坏了我们劳动所需要的和平环境。谁能保证他们的玩火不会掀起更大的爆炸呢？所以当我们每天纪录增长着的生产成绩时，我们也决不会忘记中东所发生的一切事情。
    帝国主义者在中国、朝鲜、越南、埃及挨过揍的事实证明，它们总是想奴役人家，而结果总是被觉悟了的人民赶出去，总是吃败仗。它们的失败是“命中注定”，这一次也不会例外。
    阿拉伯兄弟们，正义在你们这一边，胜利在你们这一边。我们和全世界爱好和平的人民紧紧地站在你们一边，假使敌人敢于发动战争，我们就叫他们倒下去永远再也爬不起来！
                          苏州市金阊机械电机厂　全体职工
    帝国主义者应认清时代，及早滚出中东！
    我们历史科学工作者，对美英帝国主义者武装侵略阿拉伯各国的可耻行为表示最大的愤慨，并提出严正的抗议。
    近年来，英雄的阿拉伯人民在反对帝国主义，争取民族独立的斗争中取得了一次又一次的胜利。但是帝国主义者不甘心于他们的失败，他们为了龌龊的殖民利益，在用尽一切阴谋诡计之后，又悍然采取武装侵略的行动向阿拉伯人民公开进攻。这种侵略行为严重地威胁着中东地区和全世界的和平，我们中国人民不能坐视不问，对美英帝国主义者的这种血腥冒险行动，我们不能不提出严重的抗议和警告！
    作为历史科学工作者，我们有必要再一次强调指出现代历史的特点：这是东风压倒西风的时代，是民族独立运动取得决定性胜利的时代，是帝国主义灭亡的时代；殖民主义的时代已经一去不复返了；帝国主义者再想用剑与火来继续奴役其他国家的人民，是万万行不通的了；民族独立与民族解放运动的洪流在近半世纪以来汹涌澎湃，决不是一小撮垄断资本家所能遏止得了的！1953年朝中人民反击以美国为首的侵朝军队的伟大胜利、1956年埃及人民反击英法侵略者的伟大胜利，生动地、确切地说明了我们时代的特点！
    我们坚决拥护我国政府和苏联政府的历次声明，反对美英武装侵略中东。美英侵略军必须立即从黎巴嫩、从约旦和利比亚滚出去。胜利一定属于争取民族独立的阿拉伯人民！

          一　定　斗　争　到　底！
    我们愤怒地抗议美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦。我们很清楚，美英帝国主义的侵略计划，不只是针对着黎巴嫩和约旦人民，而且针对着伊拉克共和国、阿拉伯联合共和国，针对着整个中东人民，也是对全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅。
    我们中国人民，过去受尽了帝国主义侵略的苦头，在共产党的领导下，经过多少年的流血斗争才获得了解放，成为自己土地上的主人。现在，我们正按照党的总路线，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，并要用最快的速度赶上和超过英国。但是，如果帝国主义胆敢进行战争冒险，我们全乡人民一定同全国和全世界人民一道，为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义的侵略而斗争到底。
    我们代表石龙乡六千多人，决心在今年以粮食每亩产量比去年翻一番，达到每人一千斤粮；社社办工厂，全乡共办六十五个工厂等实际行动来贯彻总路线，增强保卫和平的力量。
                            四川省昭化县石龙乡全体干部
              狠狠打击侵略者
    美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦的狂妄行动，再一次赤裸裸地暴露了侵略者的丑恶面目，我们和全国人民及全世界爱好和平人民一道，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，反对美英武装干涉中东，要求侵略者从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去！
    我们决心用实际行动声援伊拉克、黎巴嫩、约旦和所有阿拉伯的朋友们，我们要通过参观把各地的先进经验学好，带到实际工作中去，加速社会主义建设，尽一切力量维护世界和平！
    伊拉克和黎巴嫩的朋友们，我们是坚决和你们站在一起的。
    斩断侵略者魔爪！美英帝国主义者滚出中东去！

            谎言欺骗不了人民
    我们看了美国战争贩子艾森豪威尔在本月15日对美国人民所进行的欺骗演说之后，激起了我们无比的愤怒。
    艾森豪威尔无耻的抹煞事实真象，混淆是非，狡辩抵赖，来欺骗美国人民，掩护其侵略的实质。我们不禁要问侵略者，为了“美国的福利”就可以横行霸道的在距本国十万八千里的外国领土上杀人放火吗？很显然这种“美国的福利”就是维护垄断资本巨头的血腥利益。
    黎巴嫩的领土本来是完整的，而美国政府武装干涉黎巴嫩，恰恰是证明美国才是破坏黎巴嫩领土完整的凶手。
    我们要告诉艾森豪威尔，一切欺骗人民的卑鄙行为都是不能得逞的。事实胜过狡辩，海盗式的逻辑不能为自己掩护罪行，找出任何出路。
    我们确信，这些谎言欺骗不了美国人民。更欺骗不了全世界爱好和平的人民。只能激起人们更大的愤怒，坚决起来与帝国主义作斗争。

                          王艮仲、资耀华、李文杰等四十六人
        帝国主义不能再任意摆布人民
    美英帝国主义武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦，威胁伊拉克共和国，制造战争危机，我们对此感到无比的愤怒。帝国主义任意摆布和奴役人民的时代，已经一去不复返了。现在，帝国主义还不识时务摆出一副狰狞的面孔来横行霸道，是吓不倒人的，也是注定要失败的。
    我们天主教人士非常熟悉帝国主义的狰狞面孔，也亲身尝受过帝国主义统治的苦味，正因如此，我们才愈感到帝国主义的可恨与独立自主的可贵，同时对那些为摆脱帝国主义蹂躏而奋斗的人们寄与无限的同情与热烈的支持。我们坚决抗议美英帝国主义的这种侵略行为，坚决要它们赶快从中东撤出去。
    我们要独立自主地办好教会，把帝国主义留下的毒素彻底肃清；要争取今年做到一千个劳动日，多买地方公债，多献卖铜铁，我们要用这些实际行动支援祖国的社会主义建设，支援中东人民的斗争。
                          山西榆次市天主教全体神职人员
              我们的战斗
    我们，一群广州的报刊推广人员，对英美的疯狂的海盗行为，表示极大的愤怒！我们要和帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。我们要使广大人民群众及时看清英美帝国主义的凶恶嘴脸，要使广大人民群众迅速知道全世界人民为制止英美侵略所采取的行动。因此我们决心要更好地做好报纸推广工作，把党报更早、更广泛地传送到广大的读者手中。
    我们大大扩大了晚报零售的队伍，出动了所有可以出动的人力。我们像参加战斗一样，在报纸发行前，我们严阵以待，报纸一到手我们就飞奔向各条马路、各个十字街口、各条街巷、各个角落。我们大声叫卖，我们高声宣传。当看到人们读报时愤怒表情与一定要把侵略者赶出中东的决心时，我们更增加了和美英侵略者作斗争的决心和信心：一定要把美英帝国主义打垮！
                          广州市邮局永汉北路报刊门市部
        我们决不容许豺狼吞噬人民
    我们中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下，在祖国的土地上赶走了帝国主义，粉碎了国内的反动统治，获得了解放。今天我们全国人民在党的“鼓足干劲、力争上游，多、快、好、省的建设社会主义”总路线的照耀下，正以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进，用我们自己的双手创造幸福生活的时候，美英帝国主义不顾全世界爱好和平人民的反对，公然出兵侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，这不能不使我们特别愤怒。但是，我们要告诉美英侵略者，今天已经是东风压倒西风的时代，是全世界人民觉醒起来并要掌握自己命运的时代。我们站起来了的具有降龙伏虎力量的中国人民，决不允许豺狼吞噬黎巴嫩和约旦的人民！美、英帝国主义这种可耻的、丧心病狂的侵略行动，在正义人民的面前，必然要遭到坚决的回击，而遭到可耻的失败！
