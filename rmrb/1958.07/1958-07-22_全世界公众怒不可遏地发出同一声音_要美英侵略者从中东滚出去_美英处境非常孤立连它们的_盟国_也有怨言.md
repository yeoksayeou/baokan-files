　  Xinhua News Agency, July 21st – Since the U.S. and British imperialists’ armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, the development of the international situation in the past week has clearly demonstrated that the U.S. and British aggressors have fallen into an unprecedentedly isolated situation.

    China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries have firmly supported the struggle of the Arab people and issued solemn and powerful warnings to the U.S. and British war provocateurs. From China and the Soviet Union, to India and Indonesia in Asia, to Italy in Europe and Argentina in South America, masses are holding marches and rallies everywhere. The public in all countries of the world is indignantly voicing the same call: "U.S. and British aggressors, get out of Lebanon and Jordan!" "Stop the U.S. and British imperialists from interfering in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern countries!"

    When the United States sent troops to invade Korea in 1950, it was also isolated among the people of the world. However, at that time, the United States could still operate the majority voting machine in the United Nations to some extent. The United States also had to come out and take the lead in the Korean War, but at that time, it could still drag out fifteen "allies" to provide some cannon fodder. But the situation this week is very different. American newspapers say that many "allies" in the North Atlantic Group are complaining about the United States and Britain, and some South American countries governments controlled by the United States are "defecting at the last moment," and the United States is "unprecedentedly isolated" in the United Nations.

    In the Arab world, the only ones who came out to "support" the U.S. and British aggressors were the Hussein and Chamoun traitor groups sitting on their bayonets. What the pirates of the second half of the twentieth century encountered was the even higher wave of national independence movements of the entire Arab people.

    The conclusion of the joint defense agreement between the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq is a firm answer to the U.S. and British aggressors.

    The United States had some hope for the government of Saudi Arabia, but the Saudi Arabian authorities have repeatedly announced that they refuse to allow American planes carrying gasoline to Jordan to fly over Saudi Arabian airspace.

    Throughout Asia, where nationalist sentiment is running high, with the exception of the remaining governments of a few Baghdad Pact member states, and with the exception of a few Syngman Rhees and the like who also live off American bayonets and "aid," no other national government has publicly announced its support for the U.S. and British aggression. Moreover, as in Pakistan, broad public opinion is strongly opposed to the government's support for the U.S. and Britain, and wants the government to learn a lesson from the Iraqi revolution.

    Even the Japanese rulers who sold themselves to the United States, under the angry tide of opposition to U.S. and British aggression from the Japanese and world people, had to put up the sign of "regret" over the U.S. and British dispatch of troops.

    Many Asian governments have condemned the U.S. and British acts of aggression and demanded that U.S. and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Indonesian government has decided to recognize the Republic of Iraq and has demanded that U.S. and British troops immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Indian government stated that it believed that foreign troops should withdraw. The Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué condemning the armed intervention by the United States and Britain in Lebanon and Jordan. The Prime Minister of Ceylon issued a statement calling on the United Nations to intervene in the Middle East situation to prevent further deterioration of the Middle East situation and to enable the troops of the United States and Britain to withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. The Government of the Federation of Malaya stated that it fully sympathized with the national aspirations of the people of the Middle East.

    In South America, the tide of nationalism is also changing the situation. When the United States invaded Korea in 1950, it even brought out a South American country—Colombia—to send troops. However, this time, when the United Nations Security Council discussed the US proposal to reorganize the United Nations forces, the Colombian representative, although voting in favor of the proposal, stated before voting that it was not prepared to send troops to the Middle East as it did during the Korean War.

    In Europe, the Swedish government publicly expressed its disagreement with the US intervention. The Austrian government closed its western airspace, prohibiting American planes from violating its airspace to carry intervention troops to the Middle East.

    What particularly surprised the United States was the attitude of its partners in the North Atlantic Group. It is said that the U.S. State Department was originally confident that these "allies" would support it. After the United States and Britain had negotiated a broad plan for armed aggression against Arab countries, they only hurriedly notified France before dispatching troops. Other countries only found out after the US troops landed in Lebanon.

    However, the reactions of these partners were far beyond the expectations of the U.S. and Britain. As soon as the U.S. and British aggression began, most countries on the North Atlantic Council were concerned about the consequences of this action and adopted a "hands-off" attitude.

    West German officials emphasized that the U.S. and British action was "outside the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Italy's "lack of enthusiasm" for U.S. and British actions has also caused the United States anxiety.

    According to reports, these two countries, like France, felt "indignant" at the U.S. and Britain's private talks to divide up the Middle Eastern colonial spheres of influence, excluding them. Some Nordic countries and Greece are particularly worried about the expansion of the war.

    According to a report in the British "Observer" on the 20th, "West Germany and Italy are taking the lead in sharply opposing the US and British policies. They are doing so with the encouragement of the new government of de Gaulle, and with the support of the Scandinavian countries and Greece. This seems to be forming something like a third force." The emergence of this new situation in the North Atlantic Group, which the United States has always regarded as the "pillar of the Western world," fully illustrates the degree of political and moral isolation of the U.S. and British aggressors.

    The situation around the world is reflected to some extent in the United Nations. During the recent Security Council discussion of the US proposal to organize United Nations forces to expand aggression against the Middle East, Sweden insisted on opposing it. News said that Sweden's attitude reflected the sentiments of many capitalist countries' representatives in the United Nations. Before this proposal was rejected in the Security Council, a United Press International reporter admitted: "Washington is facing difficulties that are greater than any U.S. proposal has encountered in the United Nations for several years."

　  全世界公众怒不可遏地发出同一声音
    要美英侵略者从中东滚出去
    美英处境非常孤立连它们的“盟国”也有怨言
    新华社21日讯  美英帝国主义武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦以来，一个星期里国际事态的发展，已经清楚地表明了：美英侵略者陷入空前孤立的处境。
    中国、苏联和社会主义阵营其他各国，都坚决支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，对美英战争挑衅者提出了严正和强有力的警告。从中国和苏联，到亚洲的印度和印度尼西亚，到欧洲的意大利和南美的阿根廷，到处群众都在举行游行、集会，世界各国公众在怒不可遏地发出同一个声音：“美英侵略者从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去！”“制止美英帝国主义者干涉中东各国人民的内政！”
    1950年美国出兵侵略朝鲜的时候，它在世界人民中也是孤立的。不过，那时，美国多少在联合国里还能开动起多数表决机器来。美国在侵朝战争里也不得不自己出来打前阵，不过那时，它多少还能拖出十五个“盟国”来提供一些炮灰。而这一星期来的境况却大不相同。美国报纸这样说，北大西洋集团许多“盟国”在抱怨美英，还受着美国控制的一些南美国家政府在“临阵脱逃”，美国在联合国中“空前孤立”。
    在阿拉伯世界里，出来“支持”美英侵略者的只有就是坐在他们刺刀上的侯赛因和夏蒙卖国集团。二十世纪后半叶的海盗们遇到的是，整个阿拉伯世界人民更加高涨的民族独立运动的怒浪。
    阿拉伯联合共和国同伊拉克共和国签订了共同防御协定，是给予美英侵略者的一个坚定回答。
    美国对沙特阿拉伯政府是有一些指望的，但是，沙特阿拉伯当局已一再宣布，它拒绝让运汽油到约旦去的美国飞机飞越沙特阿拉伯领空。
    在民族主义情绪高涨的整个亚洲地区，除了残存的几个巴格达条约成员国政府外，除了几个也是靠美国刺刀和“援助”过活的李承晚之流外，再没有一个国家政府公开宣布支持美英侵略行径。而且，像在巴基斯坦，广大公众舆论在强烈反对政府支持美英，要政府从伊拉克革命中吸取教训。
    就是卖身投靠美国的日本统治者，在日本和世界人民反对美英侵略的怒潮下，也不得不打出对美英出兵“遗憾”的招牌。
    亚洲的许多国家政府斥责美英侵略行为，要求美英军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。印度尼西亚政府已经决定承认伊拉克共和国，并且要求美英军队立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。印度政府声明认为外国军队应该撤退。阿富汗外交部发表公报，谴责美英两国武装干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的行动。锡兰总理发表声明，要求联合国干预中东局势，防止中东局势进一步恶化，并且使得美英两国军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。马来亚联合邦政府声明完全同情中东各国人民的民族愿望。
    在南美，民族主义的潮流也在改变着局势。1950年美国侵略朝鲜时，还弄出一个南美国家——哥伦比亚出兵。但是，这次，在联合国安全理事会讨论美国关于再次组织联合国部队的提案时，哥伦比亚代表虽然投票支持这个提案，但是他在投票前就声明，它不准备像它在朝鲜战争时那样派遣军队去中东了。
    在欧洲，瑞典政府公开表示不同意美国的干涉。奥地利政府封闭了西部领空，禁止美国飞机侵越其领空载运干涉军去中东。
    特别使得美国吃惊的是，北大西洋集团里伙伴们的态度。据说，美国国务院原来满有把握，以为这些“盟国”是会支持的。美国同英国商订了武装侵略阿拉伯国家的广泛计划后，只在出兵前才匆匆通知了法国一下，其他国家是到美军在黎巴嫩登陆后才知道。
    但是，这些伙伴们的反应都大大出于美英的意料之外。美英侵略行动一开始，多数国家在北大西洋集团理事会上就对这种行动的后果感到忧虑，采取“不插手”的态度。
    西德官员强调美英行动是“北大西洋公约组织范围以外的”。意大利对美英行动的“缺乏热情”，也引起了美国的不安。
    消息说，这两个国家同法国一样，对美英单独密谈划分中东殖民势力的计划，而把它们排斥在外，感到“愤慨”。北欧一些国家和希腊则特别担心战争扩大。
    据英国“观察家报”20日报道，“西德和意大利带头在尖锐反对美英政策，它们这样做受到了戴高乐新政府的鼓励，受到了斯堪的纳维亚国家和希腊的支持。这样好似形成一种类似第三种力量的东西。”在美国一直认为是“西方世界支柱”的北大西洋集团里，这种新情况的出现，充分说明了美英侵略者在政治上和道义上的孤立程度。
    世界各地的情况，在联合国里有着某种程度的反映。在最近安全理事会讨论美国关于组织联合国部队来扩大对中东侵略的提案时，瑞典坚持反对。消息说，瑞典的态度反映了联合国中许多资本主义国家代表的情绪。在这个提案在安全理事会被否决前，合众国际社记者承认：“华盛顿面临困难之大，是若干年来美国任何提案在联合国都没有遭到过的。”
