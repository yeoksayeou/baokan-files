Happily Watching Seedlings Grow into Lush Trees
    Ma Shaobo
In recent years, I have had this strong feeling: New talents are emerging in China's art circles, and everywhere is a scene of vigorous vitality and vibrant colors. Just from the perspective of the opera world, it is difficult to remember so many new names clearly. Please look in the capital, please look all over the country: every opera genre, every opera troupe, every opera school, without exception, has seen the emergence of many rising stars. These new forces are not only leaping forward on the socialist road of being both red and expert, but also in terms of quantity, they are by no means comparable to the old society and the old era, multiplied by more than ten thousand times!
I recently watched the graduation performance of the eighth-grade students of the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts, and I was filled with such joyful feelings. These students entered school in 1950, when they were still children wearing red scarves. After the party's affectionate cultivation and the teachers' careful guidance, they have finally blossomed and borne fruit, and grown up.
The educational policy of "all-round development and teaching according to aptitude" is a correct and revolutionary policy in opera schools. This is not only reflected in artistic learning; more importantly, it is reflected in putting politics in command in educational work, and comprehensively combining artistic learning with political learning and cultural learning. The new era has even more urgent hopes for the new generation, and strictly requires this generation to become new people of communism, and definitely not to cultivate a group of "stars" who single-mindedly pursue personal fame and fortune like in the old era.
After these students entered school, the school inherited and carried forward the traditional teaching experience in art, first carrying out strict basic training to lay the foundation for literary and martial arts skills, and then carefully learning full plays and performing arts. To this day, they have each learned important roles in thirty-nine to fifty plays, mastered the Peking Opera performance methods and artistic skills such as singing, reciting, acting, and fighting, and initially understood how to create roles.
Not only should students be able to handle both civil and military roles, and be proficient in all types of characters, but also they should have a high level of cultural accomplishment. For art workers, improving culture is an important condition. In the new opera school, students' cultural learning occupies a certain proportion. To this day, their literature, history, and other courses have reached the high school level. They have also studied the history of Chinese drama and advanced drama theory knowledge. This is a revolutionary significance for the old-style opera classes' education system.
In terms of political and ideological education, in addition to studying political courses from shallow to deep, they have also undergone the tempering of successive political movements; especially in the revolutionary upsurge of anti-rightist and anti-corruption campaigns, they have carried out the struggle between the two roads on the political and ideological front, which has further enhanced their revolutionary consciousness. It further clarified that only by adhering to the literary and artistic policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers can the opera art have the only correct path. In the past few years, in addition to regularly conducting on-campus and off-campus practice performances, they have also often gone to factories, rural areas, and troops to perform, and carried out certain labor exercises, so that they were combined with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from the beginning.
After watching their graduation performance this time, everyone said in unison: "The performance is good, there is hope!" Is it just to encourage the younger generation? Of course, there is such a factor, but the main reason is that the performance is indeed good.
First of all, the students can use the spirit of collectivism to make the performed programs become complete works of art. Everyone is relatively proficient in dissolving themselves into the roles; secondly, several actors who play the main roles, such as Yu Dalu who played Gao Chong in "Picking the Chariot," He Guanqi who played Jin Wushu; Yang Qiuling who played Su San in "Yu Tang Chun;" Wu Yuzhang who played Bao Zheng in "Qin Xianglian," Cao Yilin who played Xianglian, Liang Youlian who played the Imperial Aunt, Jin Yuhui who played the Imperial Mother, etc., not only have good appearance and voice conditions, but also perform with distinct personalities, real emotions, and are quite moving. The joy filled me with so much joy that I almost forgot that this play was performed by young people who were not even twenty years old!
I sat in the audience thinking all along: It would be good to call the rightist Wu Zuguang to see it today. Because it was this group of students that Wu Zuguang viciously ridiculed a year ago. He viciously clamored: "Whether on the Peking Opera stage, on the stages of various local operas, on the storytelling stages, or even on the movie screen, how many of those active actors who leave a relatively deep impression on the audience, that is, those with prestige and achievements, are new people cultivated in the eight years since liberation?" Now, let him see Yu Dalu and others' momentum, posture, singing, reciting, acting, and fighting skills, and see Yang Qiuling and others' appearance, singing skills, and calm and delicate performances!
Today, I am happy to see the seedlings grow into lush trees. The vigorous growth of the students is another crisp and loud slap in the face to the rightists!
The Long March has just taken the first step. We must dare to adopt an attitude of decisive break and struggle with all old ideas and old styles that are not conducive to socialist construction, re-bloom and bear fruit, and the future is unlimited!

    喜看幼苗绿成荫
    马少波
    近几年来，我一直有这样强烈的感觉：我国艺术界新人辈出，到处是蓬蓬勃勃万紫千红的景象。单从戏曲界来说，你就很难记得清楚那么多的新名字。请在首都看吧，请到全国各地去看吧：每一个剧种、每一个剧团、每一个戏曲学校都绝无例外地涌现出不少的后起之秀。这些新生力量不但在社会主义又红又专的道路上飞跃前进着；即在数量上也绝非旧社会旧时代所可比拟，多到何止千万倍！
    最近看了中国戏曲学校八年级学生的毕业公演，正是怀着这样喜跃的心情。这批学生是1950年入学的，那时他们还都是带着红领巾的孩子呢。经过党的亲切培育、名师们的精心教导，现在，终于开花结果，成长起来了。
    “全面发展，因材施教”的教育方针，在戏曲学校是一个正确的革命的方针。这不仅表现在艺术学习上；更重要的是表现在在教育工作中政治挂帅，艺术学习和政治学习、文化学习全面结合。新的时代对新生一代的希望更为迫切，严格要求他们这一代成为共产主义的新人，绝不是要培养出一批旧时代那样孜孜追求个人名利的“角儿”。
    这批学生入学后，学校在艺术上继承和发扬了传统的教学经验，首先进行严格的基本训练，奠定文、武功夫的基础，然后认真地学正戏，学表演艺术。到今天，他们各自学会了三十九出到五十出戏的重要角色，掌握了京剧表演方法和唱、念、做、打等艺术技巧，初步懂得怎样创造角色了。
    不但使学生作到文武昆乱不挡，生旦净丑俱全；还要使学生具有较高的文化修养。对于艺术工作者来说，提高文化，不能不说是重要的条件。在新的戏曲学校里，学生的文化学习占一定的比重，到今天，他们的文学、历史等课程，都达到了高中水平。并且学习了中国戏剧史和先进的戏剧理论知识，对于旧科班的教育制度，这是一个意义重大的革命。
    在政治思想教育方面，他们除了由浅入深地学习政治课之外，并且经过了历次政治运动的冶炼；特别是在反右和双反的革命高潮中，进行了政治思想战线上两条道路的斗争，更提高了革命的觉悟。进一步明确了只有坚持为工农兵服务的文艺方针，才是戏曲艺术唯一的正确的道路。几年来，他们除了定期进行校内外的实习演出之外，并且经常到工厂、农村、部队去演出，进行了一定的劳动锻炼，使之一开始就与工农兵大众相结合。
    这次看了他们的毕业公演，大家异口同声地说：“演的好，有希望！”只是为了奖掖后进吗？当然有这种因素在内，但是主要的还是因为的确演得好。
    首先是学生们都能够以集体主义的精神，使演出的节目，成为完整的艺术品。每个人都比较熟练地溶身于角色之中；其次是几个担任主要角色的演员，如在“挑滑车”饰演高宠的俞大陆、饰演金兀术的何冠奇；在“玉堂春”中饰演苏三的杨秋玲；在“秦香莲”中饰演包拯的吴钰璋、饰演香莲的曹毅琳、饰演皇姑的梁幼莲、饰演国太的金煜辉等，不但扮相、嗓子条件好，而且演得性格鲜明、感情真实，相当动人心魄。满心喜悦竟使我几乎忘记了这一台戏是哪一个也都未满二十岁的青年们的演出！
    我坐在观众席里一直这样想：今天叫右派分子吴祖光来看看才好。因为一年前吴祖光所恶毒嘲笑的正是这班学生，他恶毒地叫嚣过：“无论在京剧舞台上、各种地方戏的舞台上，曲艺舞台上，以至电影的银幕上，那些活跃的、留给观众比较深刻的印象的，也就是说有声望、有成就的演员，有几个是解放八年培养出来的新人呢？”现在，让他来看看俞大陆等的气魄、工架、唱、念、做、打的功夫，看看杨秋玲等的扮相、唱工和沉静细腻的表演吧！
    于今，喜看幼苗绿成荫，学生们的蓬勃成长，对于右派分子又是一记清脆响亮的耳光！
    万里长征刚刚迈开第一步。要勇于和一切不利于社会主义建设的旧思想旧作风采取决裂和斗争的态度，再开花再结果，未来是不可限量的！
