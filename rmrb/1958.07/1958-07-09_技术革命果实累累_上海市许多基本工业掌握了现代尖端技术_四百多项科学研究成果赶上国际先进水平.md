Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th—The Shanghai Science and Technology Research Work Leap Forward Exhibition, which opened today, displays more than 2,600 new research achievements from research units, universities, and production departments in Shanghai. According to statistics, more than 440 of these have reached or surpassed international advanced levels. Many research results show that Shanghai has mastered modern cutting-edge technologies in some basic industrial production.

	Automated Steel Pouring Process

	Automating the steel pouring process to save raw materials and improve the quality of steel ingots is one of the four major new technologies in the world's smelting industry. The Central Laboratory of the Shanghai Metallurgical Industry Bureau successfully trial-produced the internationally used vertical continuous casting machine last year. This year, they boldly created a horizontal continuous casting machine that does not exist abroad. Its advantages are simple mechanical structure and convenient operation. It can solve the cutting problems of the vertical continuous casting machine, and the manufacturing cost is one-fifth lower than the vertical type.

	Non-woven Fabric

	As the latest revolutionary achievement in the world's textile industry, non-woven fabric—fabric made by chemically bonding fiber webs together without spinning or weaving—was originally regarded by the Shanghai Branch of the Textile Science Research Institute as a long-term research project, and they hesitated to start research. Recently, after studying the general line and breaking down superstitions, several young technicians in this unit, with the assistance of engineers, spent only five days and nights trial-producing three types of non-woven fabrics that can be used for both clothing and industrial products. Their density and smoothness are the same as the latest product samples from the United Kingdom and the United States. Non-woven fabrics can make full use of various low-grade fibers, fiber waste, short fibers, etc. as raw materials. The steel used for manufacturing non-woven fabric machinery is only 35% of that used for ordinary weaving machinery.

	Thirty-Two Rare Metals

	Various precious rare metals are indispensable raw materials for the current and future cutting-edge industries. The Shanghai Nonferrous Metals Industry Company originally planned to extract twenty-one rare metals during the Second Five-Year Plan period. However, during the Great Leap Forward, the company's technicians and workers overcame the difficulties of poor equipment and insufficient information, and extracted thirty-two types of rare metals in the first half of this year.

	Sintered Aluminum

	Several young researchers at the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully trial-produced a new type of aircraft structural material—sintered aluminum. Its mechanical strength and heat resistance are higher than ordinary aluminum. At high temperatures, its performance exceeds all aluminum alloys. The production of sintered aluminum has always been monopolized by capitalist countries, and technical information is completely confidential. After hard work and exploration, several young people at the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics have fully mastered the production technology of sintered aluminum.

	Ductile Iron with the Lowest Magnesium Content

	Many research results have great economic value in the current Great Leap Forward in production. To solve the problem of the large amount of expensive magnesium required for the production of ductile iron, which is blooming everywhere in the iron and steel industry, currently five or six catties of magnesium are added to every thousand catties of ductile iron. The Shanghai Ductile Iron Crankshaft Collaboration Group, composed of factories and universities, has successfully developed a new method through dozens of repeated experiments to produce high-quality ductile iron with a magnesium content of only 0.08%, breaking the capitalist countries' literature record of the lowest magnesium content of 0.10%. The Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics has manufactured two spheroidizing agents that can replace magnesium: silicon-ferro-magnesium alloy and special rare earth alloy. The quality of ductile iron made with them is better than that made with magnesium.

	New Ways for Trains to Haul More and Run Faster

	In order to further enable trains to haul more and run faster, the teachers of the Steam Locomotive Teaching and Research Group of Jiaotong University and the engineers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, after on-site observation and analysis, jointly proposed a method to slightly modify the valve gear of the KF1 locomotive to increase the speed of this type of locomotive from the original 80 kilometers per hour to 111 kilometers per hour. They also researched a method to install an adhesion weight increaser on China's MK1 main-type locomotive, which can prevent wheel slippage and increase traction tonnage by 40%, equivalent to adding more than 360 locomotives, saving the country more than 45 million yuan and more than 31,000 tons of steel.

	Nylon 66

	After the teachers of East China Institute of Chemical Technology and 18 units in various regions collaborated to complete the research on synthesizing chemical fiber nylon 66 from furfural (agricultural by-products), they designed a simple furfural plant to expand the raw material production of nylon 66. The characteristics of this simple furfural plant are that it uses local materials, has simple equipment, is easy to operate, can be built in ten days, and the entire investment is only 1,000 yuan, which can be recovered in two months. Each county and town can set it up.

	New Protein Separation and Purification

	The research on proteins is one of the eye-catching and theoretically significant research projects at the conference. The Institute of Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has done a lot of research on the relationship between the structure and function of proteins and the comparison of muscle proteins. This institute discovered a new protein from muscles that people have not known about and successfully separated and purified it, and determined its chemical structure and physicochemical properties. Biochemists in the United Kingdom, the United States, Belgium, and other countries are also paying attention to exploring—similar new proteins, but have not yet been able to separate and purify them. The Institute of Biochemistry has now decided to leap forward to a cutting-edge goal in protein research: to basically understand the mechanism of protein biosynthesis within five years, and to artificially synthesize bioactive proteins with a molecular weight of about 10,000, so that humans can more effectively master life phenomena and control various diseases.

	This exhibition fully demonstrates that advanced science and technology are not unattainable. Many of the research results exhibited at the conference are the creations of young people, junior technicians, and ordinary workers. Most of the research results were produced in a few months or even just a few days. Some scientific and technological achievements that foreigners have been working on for decades have been caught up by us. Ideological liberation and breaking down superstitions have produced huge material results; and the achievements that have been made have encouraged more people to advance towards all difficult scientific fortresses and cutting-edge technologies.

    技术革命果实累累
    上海市许多基本工业掌握了现代尖端技术  四百多项科学研究成果赶上国际先进水平
    新华社上海8日电  今天开幕的上海市科学技术研究工作跃进展览会上，展出了上海各研究单位、高等学校和生产部门的二千六百多项新的研究成果。据统计，其中有四百四十多项已经赶上或超过了国际先进水平。许多研究成果说明，上海在一些基本工业生产上已经掌握了现代尖端技术。浇钢过程自动化
    使浇钢生产过程自动化以节约原材料和提高钢锭质量，是世界上冶炼工业四大新技术之一。上海市冶金工业局中心试验室去年已经试制成功国外通用的立式连续铸锭机，今年更进一步大胆创造了国外还没有过的卧式连续铸锭机，它的优点是机械结构简单、操作方便，能解决立式连续铸锭机在切割上存在的问题，而制造费用还比立式低五分之一。无纺织布
    作为世界纺织工业中革命性的最新成就的无纺织布——不经纺和织而用化学处理方法将纤维絮层相互粘结而制成的布，原先被纺织科学研究院上海分院当作长远性研究课题，迟迟不敢动手研究。最近这个单位的几个青年技术人员学习总路线，破除了迷信以后，在工程师的协助下，只用五天一夜的时间就试制出既可作衣服又可作工业用品的三种无纺织布，紧密度和光洁度等方面都和英美等国最近的产品样品相同。无纺织布可以充分利用各种低级纤维、纤维废料、短绒等作为原料，制造无纺织布的机械设备所用的钢铁仅为普通织造机械的35％。三十二种稀有金属
    各种贵重的稀有金属是现在和将来的尖端工业不可缺乏的原料，上海市有色金属工业公司原定在第二个五年计划期间提炼出二十一种稀有金属。但是这个公司的技术人员和工人们在大跃进中鼓足干劲克服了设备差和资料不足的困难，在今年上半年内就提炼出三十二种。烧结铝
    中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所几个青年研究人员试制成功了一种新型的飞机结构材料——烧结铝，机械强度和耐热性能都高于普通的铝。在高温条件下，它的性能超过了所有的铝合金。烧结铝的生产一直为资本主义国家垄断，技术资料完全保密，冶金陶瓷研究所的几个青年人经过刻苦钻研和摸索，充分掌握了烧结铝的生产技术。用镁量最低的球墨铸铁
    许多研究成果在当前的生产大跃进中有很大的经济价值。解决钢铁工业遍地开花的球墨铸铁生产中需要大量昂贵的镁，目前每一千斤的球墨铸铁中要加镁五、六斤，由工厂和高等学校组成的上海球墨铸铁曲轴协作小组，经过几十次的反复试验，用新方法研究成功一种用镁量只有0.08％的质量良好的球墨铸铁，打破了资本主义国家文献上用镁量0.10％的最低纪录。冶金陶瓷研究所制造出两种可以代替镁的球化剂：矽铁镁合金和特种稀土合金，用它们制造出来的球墨铸铁质量比用镁的还好。火车多拉快跑的新办法
    为了进一步使火车多拉快跑，交通大学蒸汽机车教研组的教师们和上海铁路局的工程师们经过现场观测和分析研究，共同提出一种办法，将ㄎㄈㄧ机车的汽伐装置部分稍加改动，即可使这种机车的行车速度由原有的每小时八十公里提高到一百十一公里。他们还研究出在我国ㄇㄎㄧ主型机车上装置粘着重量增大器的办法，可以防止车轮空转，提高牵引吨位40％，等于增加三百六十多台机车，为国家节约资金四千五百多万元，钢铁三万一千多吨。尼龙六六
    华东化工学院的教师们和各地十八个单位协作完成了由糠醛（农产品下脚）合成化学纤维尼龙六六的研究后，又设计出简易糠醛厂，以扩大尼龙六六的原料生产。这种简易糠醛厂的特点真是就地取材，设备简单，操作容易，十天即可建成，全部投资只要一千元，两个月后即可收回。每个县、镇都可以办。新蛋白分离提纯
    蛋白质的研究，是会上引人注目的具有重大意义的理论研究项目之一。科学院生物化学研究所在蛋白质的结构与功能的关系、肌肉蛋白的比较等方面已做了不少研究工作。这个研究所从肌肉中发现了一种人们一直不知道的新蛋白，并成功地将它分离提纯，对它的化学结构和物理化学特性进行了测定。英、美、比利时等国的生物化学家们也都在注意探索—类似的新蛋白，但迄今还不能分离提纯。生物化学研究所现在决定在蛋白质的研究上向一个最尖端的目标跃进：五年内基本上弄清楚蛋白质生物合成的基理，用人工方法综合出分子量在一万左右的具有生物活力的蛋白质，使人类更有效地掌握生命现象，控制各种疾病。
    这个展览会充分显示：先进科学技术并不高不可攀。会上展出的研究成果中很多是青年人、低级技术人员、普通工人的创造，大部分研究成果是在几个月甚至短短的几天之内搞出来的。有些科学技术成就，外国搞了几十年，我们迎头赶上了。思想解放，打破迷信，已产生了巨大的物质成果；而已取得的成就又鼓舞更多的人向一切艰难的科学堡垒、尖端的技术迈进。
