Creating New Conditions for Large-Scale Freshwater Fish Farming
Artificial Incubation of Fish Fry Successful

(Our Dispatch) Recently, young staff members of the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute of the Ministry of Aquatic Products broke with superstition and solved the historically unresolvable problem of artificial controlled spawning and incubation of silver carp and bighead carp within a short period. The first batch of over 30,000 fish fry hatched are physically healthy and grow faster than fish fry collected from rivers.

This artificial fish fry incubation uses a stimulation method that combines creating an external environment with internal pro催青 (promoting spawning). This method utilizes three types of stimulants made from carp pituitary glands, frog pituitary glands, and the anterior lobe of mammalian pituitary glands to inject parent fish over five years old intraperitoneally. Then, the water level and oxygen content of the fish pond are increased at a certain flow rate, so that the parent fish receive physiological and external stimulation, causing them to estrus, ovulation, and ejaculation. On June 3, using this method, the ovaries of female silver carp No. 215 and female bighead carp No. 013 were first matured. However, because the male silver carp produced too little semen at that time, the researchers studied the method of dissecting the male silver carp, cutting the testicles into small pieces, and washing out the sperm with physiological saline, and then performing artificial insemination. An examination after one and a half hours revealed that it had developed to the sixteen-cell stage. After seventeen hours, strong fish fry were hatched one after another.

In the past, methods for artificially controlling the spawning and incubation of silver carp and bighead carp have also been proposed and discussed many times, but many senior aquatic experts believed that there were many difficulties and that it would take at least ten years of exploration to succeed. Some experts also emphasized that it would be necessary to spend a lot of money to build a fish pond similar to the environment of large rivers before it would be possible to complete the artificial control of spawning and incubation work. Others believed that silver carp and bighead carp have been farmed in our country for more than a thousand years, and our ancestors have not solved the problem of artificial incubation for a long time. There is no such experience in other countries in the world, and we will not be able to do it in a short time.

Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, some young researchers at the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute liberated their minds through red-expert debates, brought into play a high degree of revolutionary drive and bold originality, and completed this work quickly, well, and economically. They uncovered the secrets that had not been solved for thousands of years, broke the mysterious views that scientists and experts considered to be out of reach, and wrote a glorious page in the history of aquaculture in our country.

In the experiment, the South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute tried its best to make this method adapt to the conditions of the vast rural fishing villages. The equipment it needs is only a microscope with a small magnification and a few small earthen ponds, and a simple wooden waterwheel. The investment is small and the construction is easy. There are no special requirements for the parent fish that lay eggs, and the fish raised in ordinary rural fish ponds can be used. The operation process in production is simple and can be mastered after only one week of study. At present, fishery (agricultural) cooperatives in Guangxi, Yunnan and other provinces have sent people to visit and study. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Aquatic Products has also opened two training courses.

Grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp account for a large proportion of freshwater fish production in my country. An important aspect of the great leap forward in aquatic production is also freshwater fish farming. In the past, because we completely relied on collecting natural fish fry from several large rivers, not only did we spend a lot of manpower and financial resources, but also the mortality rate during transportation was alarming. The successful artificial control and incubation of silver carp and bighead carp can not only completely implement the policy of taking materials locally and stocking them locally, but also lay the foundation for the great leap forward in freshwater fish farming production.

### 为大规模淡水养鱼创造了新条件  人工孵化鱼苗成功

    为大规模淡水养鱼创造了新条件
    人工孵化鱼苗成功
    本报讯　最近水产部南海水产研究所青年工作人员打破迷信，在短期内解决了历史上不能解决的鲢、鳙鱼人工控制产卵孵化问题。第一批孵化出来的三万多尾鱼苗，体质健康，比在河川中所张捞的鱼苗成长得快。
    这次人工孵化鱼苗是采用创造外界环境与内在催青相结合的刺激法。这种方法是利用鲤鱼垂体、蛙垂体及哺乳动物垂体前叶制成三种刺激素，对五岁以上的亲鱼进行腹腔注射，再以一定的流速增高鱼池水位和含氧量，使亲鱼获得在生理上的和外在的刺激，引起它们发情排卵与排精。6月3日利用这种办法，首先使215号雌鲢及013号雌鳙卵巢成熟，但当时由于雄鲢排精太少，研究所的工作人员就研究采用解剖雄鲢的方法，将精巢切成小片，以生理食盐水洗出精子，然后进行人工授精。一个半小时后检查，已发育到十六个细胞期。经过十七个小时，茁壮的鱼苗就陆续孵出。
    人工控制产卵孵化鲢鳙鱼的方法，过去也曾多次被提出讨论，但是许多高级水产专家都认为困难很多，至少需经过十年的摸索才能成功。还有一些专家们强调必需花很多的钱，建造一个与大江河环境相类似的鱼池，才有可能完成人工控制产卵孵化工作。也有人认为，鲢、鳙鱼养殖在我国已有一千多年的历史，我们祖先长期内没有解决人工孵化的问题，现在世界各国也还没有这种经验，我们在短期内也做不成。
    南海水产研究所的一些年轻的研究人员，在总路线的光辉照耀下，经过红专辩论，解放了思想，发挥了高度的革命干劲和大胆独创的精神，多快好省地完成了这项工作，揭穿了千年来未解决的秘密，打破了科学家专家们认为高不可攀的神秘观点，为我国水产养殖史上写上了光辉的一页。
    南海水产研究所在试验当中，尽量使这个方法适应广大农村渔村的条件。它所需要的设备，只有一架倍数很小的显微镜和几个小型土池、一架木制的简单水车，投资既小，建设也容易。产卵的亲鱼也没有什么特殊要求，普通农村中鱼池养的鱼都可以利用。生产中的操作过程简单，只要学习一个多星期即能掌握。目前广西、云南等各省的渔（农）业合作社都派人前去参观学习。广东水产厅也开办了两期训练班。
    青、草、鲢、鳙在目前我国淡水鱼生产中有较大的比重，水产生产大跃进的重要方面也是淡水养鱼。过去，因为完全依靠在几条大江中张捞天然鱼苗，不但人力财力耗费很多，而且运输途中死亡率也很惊人。鲢、鳙人工控制孵化成功，不但完全可以贯彻就地取材、就地放养的淡水养殖方针，而且也为淡水养鱼生产大跃进，创造了基础。
