    On Brown Mountain
    By our reporter Huang Changlu
    I followed a caravan of packhorses, heading towards Brown Mountain on a rugged mountain path.
    Brown Mountain is located on the border between southern Yunnan and Myanmar. It had been described as gloomy and terrifying, with high mountains, dangerous roads, and a den of wild beasts. However, what I saw before me was a completely different scene. The hillsides were covered with lush grass, olive trees laden with green fruit lined both sides of the mountain road, and a gentle breeze carried the fragrance of flowers. The mountains were very quiet, and we walked for several hours without seeing a village or encountering a pedestrian. Occasionally, we saw people burning wild grass and trees on the distant hillsides. The Bulang people have been using this primitive method of "slash-and-burn" agriculture for more than a thousand years.
    Suddenly, a narrow plain appeared in the embrace of the mountain peaks. In the plain were checkerboard-like rice paddies, and on the nearby hill stood a cluster of new houses. My companion pointed to the houses and said, "That's the new village built by the cooperative. The fields in the plain were newly opened by them. This plain is called Meng'ang, and behind those mountain peaks across from us is our neighboring country, Myanmar."
    We descended to the foot of the mountain, crossed a small stream, and arrived at the Meng'ang plain. More than a dozen newly built bamboo houses and granaries were scattered on a small hill. The granaries were filled with the new grain from last year's bumper harvest of the fifteen cooperative members. The sound of chopping wood, "clang, clang," came from the mountain. Bulang women wearing short shirts and colorful skirts, small thumb-thick earrings, and wrapped in floral headscarves were weaving grass mats in the village, preparing to continue building new houses. Sheep grazed on the grass near the village, and water buffalo, having toiled in the fields all day, slowly strolled back to the village and were tied under the new houses. The sound of wooden pestles pounding rice blended with the laughter of children. What a delightful picture of a happy border village!
    In the evening, we went to a new bamboo house that had just been completed yesterday. Most of the cooperative members were there, as well as the two work cadres stationed in the cooperative. Everyone sat together, talking about the process of building this new village.
    The fifteen Bulang people now living in the Meng'ang plain were originally the poorest farmers from the Man'e Mai village, fifteen miles away. In 1955, their average income was only 107 jin of grain per person. At that time, these fifteen families couldn't even afford to raise a pig, and the only one or two hoes each family owned were given as relief by the People's Government after liberation.
    Based on the characteristics of the Bulang Mountain area, where the socio-economic development was particularly backward and a complete class society had not yet formed, the Party decided to adopt a path of mutual assistance and cooperation, with strong support from the state, to help the Bulang people transition directly to socialism.
    In the spring of 1956, the Party sent a work team to Man'e Mai village to help the masses with spring plowing while promoting the benefits of mutual assistance and cooperation. Initially, six poor farmers voluntarily formed a mutual aid group. However, mutual aid groups were completely foreign to the Bulang people. Some thought that mutual aid groups meant eating from a communal pot, while others feared a loss of freedom. The work cadres repeatedly explained to them, addressing their misunderstandings and concerns, and the government helped solve the problem of food shortages. Everyone realized that organizing to dig and sow was faster, better, and more labor-saving than working individually. Soon, another seven poor farmers in the village organized a second mutual aid group.
    The Meng'ang plain has fertile soil and abundant water sources, with approximately 2,000 mu of wasteland that could be converted into paddy fields. More than a decade ago, twelve Bulang farmers had tried to farm here. Although they didn't know how to plow or apply fertilizer, they only dug with hoes, but the rice grew well. However, after the autumn harvest, the rice was all looted by the Kuomintang army, and malaria raged, killing fifteen people one after another. The survivors had no choice but to move away, and the Meng'ang plain became overgrown with reeds and weeds, and no one dared to come here again.
    When the work cadres advised the mutual aid group members to go to the Meng'ang plain to open up fields, some shook their heads and said, "Going there to open up fields will lead to death." The work team explained to them that malaria could be prevented and treated, and promised to ask the government to send a doctor along with them. To solve the difficulties in reclamation, the government also decided to provide each person with three months of food rations and give everyone four head of oxen and some walking plows, threshing machines, and other agricultural implements.
    The members of the two mutual aid groups all moved to the Meng'ang plain, and the Party and government sent a work team, including doctors and technicians, to help them. In order to concentrate their efforts on reclamation, after discussion among the members, it was decided to absorb two more poor farmers on the basis of the two mutual aid groups and establish the first agricultural production cooperative on Brown Mountain.
    The owner of this new house, twenty-four-year-old Kang Langwenwei, said that after joining the cooperative, he was still very skeptical. Seeing the government handing out this and that, and the work cadres helping with production, he thought: even blood brothers wouldn't give away a jin of rice for nothing. He was afraid that the government would take the harvested grain and he would have worked for nothing all year. After the autumn harvest, the government didn't take a single grain, and he received more than 700 jin of grain, only then did he believe that the Communist Party was sincerely helping the Bulang people develop.
    Yan Xiangzhang, the supervisory committee member of the cooperative, told several interesting stories: when the cooperative was opening up the fields, none of the members knew how to plow. Initially, one person had to pull the ox in front, and a work comrade had to hold their hand and teach them from the side. After a while, only one person was needed to pull the ox. Later, they could plow on their own. Now, eight members have learned how to plow. At first, the work cadres advised them to apply fertilizer, but everyone thought it was dirty; they taught them to soak the seeds in warm water, but they were afraid of scalding the seeds to death. He said: it's funny to think about it now, if we hadn't learned these methods, how could production have developed so quickly? Last year's harvest was more than five times higher than before the cooperative was established. In addition to eating, we also sold 750 jin of surplus grain, which was something we never dreamed of in the past.
    Cooperative member Yan Zai was a famous poor man, so poor that he didn't even have an earthen pot to cook rice. More than two years ago, when he came to Meng'ang to open up wasteland, his entire fortune was a tattered blanket. Today, he has built a new house here and brought his wife and three children back. The scattered family is reunited again.
    The night was half over. When I left this bamboo house, I was filled with emotion: the cooperative has led this group of unfortunate people with different experiences onto a path of happiness. In just two short years, what great changes have these fifteen Bulang families experienced in their lives!
    The next day, I went to observe the production activities of the members. The cooperative's more than 170 mu of paddy fields, like a yellow dragon, lay in the green valley. Some of the fields near the village had already been plowed. A middle-aged Bulang man skillfully held the plow and drove the oxen. In the plowed fields, the members trimmed the ridges very neatly. Several female members carried bamboo baskets and applied base fertilizer to the loosened fields, handful by handful. Compared with the "slash-and-burn" method I saw on the road, it seemed like they were separated by centuries. (Attached image)

### 布朗山上

    布朗山上
    本报记者　黄昌禄
    我随着一队马帮在崎岖的山道上向布朗山前进。
    布朗山在云南南部中缅两国的边界上，它曾被人描绘得十分阴森恐怖，说是山高路险，猛兽之窝。然而，呈现在我面前的却是另一番景象。山坡上芳草芊芊，山道两旁的橄榄树缀着青果，和风送来阵阵花香。山中很宁静，走了好几个钟头看不到一个村寨，遇不着一个行人。偶尔望见远处山坡上，有人在放火烧野草和树木，布朗族人民用这种原始的“刀耕火种”方法生产，已经一千多年了。
    忽然，在山峰环抱中，出现了一个狭长的平坝。坝子里是棋盘似的稻田，旁边的小山丘上有一片新房。我的旅伴指着那些房子说：“这就是合作社修建的新村，坝子里的田是他们新开的。这坝子叫孟昂，对面的那些山峰背后，便是我们的邻邦缅甸。”
    我们下到山脚，经过一条小溪，来到了孟昂坝。十多座新盖好的竹楼和谷包分布在一个小丘上，谷包里装满十五户社员去年丰收的新谷。山上传来“锵、锵”的伐木声，穿着短衫花裙的布朗族妇女戴着小拇指那样粗的耳环，包着花头巾，在寨里编织草排，准备继续盖新房。羊群在寨边啃吃青草，在田里辛苦了一天的水牛慢慢踱回寨来，被拴在新房的楼下。木杵的舂米声与孩子的笑闹声织成一片。好一幅欢乐边寨的图景！
    晚间，我们到昨天才落成的一座新竹楼上，大部分社员都来了，驻在社里的两个工作干部也来了。大家围坐在一起，谈着建设这座新村的经过。
    现在住在孟昂坝的十五户布朗人，原是离这里十五里的曼峨卖寨里最贫苦的农民。1955年，他们每人平均收入粮食只一百零七斤。那时，这十五家人连一口猪也养不起，每家仅有的一两把锄头，也是解放后人民政府救济的。
    党根据布朗山社会经济特别落后、未形成完整的阶级社会的特点，确定采取在国家大力帮助下，通过互助合作的道路，帮助布朗族直接过渡到社会主义。
    在1956年春天，党派了一个工作组到曼峨卖寨，一边帮助群众春耕生产，一边宣传互助合作的好处。最初有六户贫苦农民，自愿组成了一个互助组。但是，互助组对布朗族来说是完全陌生的东西，有的人以为互助组是吃大锅饭，有的怕不自由。工作干部针对他们的误解和顾虑反复地作了解释，政府帮助解决了没有粮食吃的困难。大家认识到组织起来挖地播种，比单干又快又好又省工。不久，寨里另外七户贫苦农民又组织了一个互助组。
    孟昂这个坝子，土质肥沃，水源充足，约有两千亩荒地可开成水田。十多年前，曾经有十二户布朗族农民在这里种过田，虽然他们不会犁田，也不知上粪，仅用锄头挖挖，但谷子也长得不错。哪知秋收后，谷子都被国民党军队抢走，疟疾又猖狂流行，先后病死十五人，虎口余生的只好一齐搬走，孟昂坝长满了芦苇和荒草，从此便无人敢到这里来。
    当工作干部劝说互助组员们到孟昂坝去开田时，有的摇摇头说：“到那里开田，要死人。”工作组向他们说明疟疾是可以预防和医治的，答应请政府派医生一同去。为了解决开荒中的困难，政府还决定发给每人三个月的口粮，发给大家四头耕牛和一些步犁、打谷机等农具。
    两个互助组的组员都搬到孟昂坝来，党和政府派了一个包括医生、技术员在内的工作组去帮助他们。为了集中力量开荒，经过组员们讨论，决定在两个互助组基础上，又吸收了两户贫苦农民，成立了布朗山上第一个农业生产合作社。
    这新房的主人，二十四岁的青年康朗温微说，他参加合作社后，心头还很怀疑，看见政府发这发那，工作干部帮助生产，心想：就是亲兄亲弟也不会白给一斤米，怕政府把收的谷子拿去，自己白苦一年。秋收后，政府一颗也不要，他一人分得七百多斤谷子，才相信共产党是真心实意帮布朗人发展。
    合作社的监察委员岩香章讲了几件有趣的事情：合作社开田时，没有一个社员会犁田，最初，要一个人在前面拉着牛、一个工作同志在旁边扶着手教。过些时候，只要一个人拉牛就行了。后来，独自一人也会犁了。现在已有八个社员学会了犁田。起初，工作干部劝上粪，大家嫌脏；教温汤浸种，又怕把籽种烫死。他说：想起来很好笑，不是学会了这些办法，生产哪能发展这样快？去年收的谷子比建社前增加五倍多，除了吃用还卖了七百五十斤余粮，这是过去连作梦都想不到的事。
    社员岩宰原是个有名的穷汉，穷的连煮饭的土锅都没有。两年多以前，他到孟昂来开荒时，全部家产就是一床破毯子。今天，他已在这里修起一座新房，把老婆和三个孩子接了回来，七分八散的家庭又团圆了。
    夜已过半，我离开这座竹楼时，心中无限感慨：合作社把这群遭遇各不相同的苦命人，带到一条幸福的路上。短短的两年，在这十五户布朗人的生活经历了多大的变化！
    第二天，我去参观了社员们的生产活动。合作社的一百七十多亩水田，像一条黄色的长龙，躺在绿色的山谷中。靠近寨子的一些田已经犁过了，一个中年布朗人，熟练的扶着犁，赶着耕牛。在犁过的田里，社员们把田埂铲的十分整齐，几个女社员背着竹箩，一把一把往犁松了的田里施放底肥。同我在路上看到那种“刀耕火种”的方法相比，好像相隔几个世纪。（附图片）
