    Soaring Ambitions, Straight to the Clouds
    A Look at the Lofty Aspirations of the People of Yu County in Undertaking Heavy Industry
    Steel Production Per Capita to Surpass Britain Next Year
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Zhang Chao reports: After four months of arduous struggle in establishing nearly eight hundred factories and mines, the people of Yu County, Shanxi Province, have now put forward a new goal: to surpass Britain in per capita steel production next year!
    Yu County is a poor mountainous area. In 1956, only forty-odd agricultural cooperatives engaged in some handicrafts during the agricultural slack season. The county's only handicraft cooperative producing simmered iron frequently suspended operations due to losses. When farmers' plows and harrows broke, they had to go elsewhere for repairs. This year, the people of Yu County have bravely and diligently striven to develop industry on a large scale. They built three small and medium-sized blast furnaces from scratch, constructed a converter furnace after three days and nights of hard work, and mined twenty-three copper mines without spending a penny. They established a gunpowder factory producing more than ten tons of products per month with eight thousand yuan. They successfully trial-produced native cement at the end of May, and now more than one hundred native cement plants have been built throughout the county. In total, over a hundred days, the county has built a total of seven hundred and ninety-three new factories and mines, and also built the first native railway in the country. The iron industry cooperative that could only produce simmered iron has now developed into a power machinery repair and manufacturing plant with eleven lathes. A mineral prospecting team composed of local experts and hundreds of farmers discovered more than fifty kinds of minerals, including iron, copper, and asbestos, in the poor mountains. The proven coal reserves alone exceed forty billion tons, and the proven iron reserves exceed ten million tons.
    The people of Yu County are not satisfied with their existing achievements, and their enthusiasm for running industry is growing. Recently, the Yu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the demands of the masses and resource conditions, put forward a new plan: to produce 100,000 tons of iron next year, averaging 1,110 jin per person; and to produce 65,000 tons of steel, averaging 720 jin per person. By 1962, iron production will reach 200,000 tons, averaging more than 2,000 jin per person; and steel production will reach 130,000 tons, averaging more than 1,400 jin per person. In addition to iron and steel, the production of other industrial products will also see huge growth. For example, by 1962, coal production will reach 10 million tons, catching up with the level of the largest Kailuan or Fushun coal mines in the country.
    In order to realize this plan, the Yu County Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to build eleven more small blast furnaces by the end of the year. Together with the three blast furnaces already built in the first half of this year, the county's ironmaking capacity will reach about 100,000 tons this year. Then, construction will be increased year by year, and by 1962, the county will have thirty small and medium-sized blast furnaces, and there will be no problem in producing 200,000 tons of iron annually.
    In terms of the machinery industry, they will expand two machinery plants on the basis of existing factories, one to produce small machine tools and agricultural water conservancy machinery, and one to produce and repair small industrial equipment. They also plan to equip each township with two machine tools within the next year, so that the township can independently solve the local tasks of repairing and fitting agricultural implements and manufacturing some new agricultural implements.
    In the electric power industry, Yu County will complete a seventy-li long high-voltage transmission line in October this year to transmit electricity from the Taiyuan power grid. At the same time, they will build seven small hydropower stations and eleven small thermal power stations within the next year, so that every township has electricity.
    After this plan is realized, Yu County will become a base point of heavy industry, and Yu County town will become a medium-sized heavy industrial city.

    鹏程万里　直上云霄
    请看盂县人民大办重工业的壮志
    钢铁产量按人口平均明年压倒英国
    本报讯　记者张超报道：山西盂县人民在经过四个月的苦战，办起近八百个厂矿以后，现在又提出了新的奋斗目标：按人口平均的钢铁产量，明年要压倒英国！
    盂县是个贫穷的山区，1956年的时候，只有四十几个农业社在农闲的时候搞些手工业。全县仅有的一个生产焖铁的手工业合作社，因为赔本，经常停工。农民的犁、耙坏了，都要到外地去修。今年，盂县人民奋勇苦战，大办工业。他们白手起家建成了三座中小型高炉；苦战三昼夜建成了一座转炉；一个钱没花，开采了二十三处铜矿；用八千元办起了一座月产十多吨产品的火药厂；5月底试制成功土水泥，现在全县已经建起了一百多个土水泥厂。总计前后一百多天，全县一共建成了新厂矿七百九十三个，还修成了全国第一条土铁路。原来只能生产焖铁的铁业社，现在已经发展成为拥有十一台车床的动力机械修造厂。土专家和几百个农民配合组成的查矿队，在穷山里查出了铁、铜、石棉等五十多种矿藏。仅仅煤的藏量，已查明有四十多亿吨，铁的藏量已查明一千多万吨。
    盂县人民并不满足于已有的成绩，他们办工业的劲头越来越高。最近，中共盂县县委根据群众的要求和资源条件，又提出了一个新的规划：明年生产十万吨铁，每人平均一千一百一十斤；生产六万五千吨钢，每人平均七百二十斤。到1962年，铁产量达到二十万吨，每人平均二千多斤；钢产量达到十三万吨，每人平均一千四百多斤。除了钢铁之外，其他工业品的产量也要有巨大的增长。例如，到1962年，煤产量将达到一千万吨，赶上目前全国最大的开滦或抚顺煤矿的水平。
    为了实现这个规划，中共盂县县委计划到年底再建十一座小高炉，连同今年上半年已建成的三座高炉，今年全县的炼铁能力将达到十万吨左右。以后逐年增建，到1962年，全县将拥有三十座中小型高炉，年产二十万吨铁完全没有问题。
    在机械工业方面，他们将在现有工厂的基础上扩建起两个机械厂，一个生产小型的工作母机和农业水利机械，一个生产和修配小型的工业设备。他们还准备在明年内给每个乡都装备两台机床，使乡能够独立解决当地的农具修配和部分新式农具的制造任务。
    在电力工业方面，盂县将在今年10月修成一条七十里长的高压输电线，把太原电力网的电力输送过来。同时，他们要在明年内建成七座小水电站和十一座小火电站，做到乡乡有电力。
    这个规划实现以后，盂县将成为一个重工业的基点，盂县县城将变成一个中型的重工业城市。
