Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 22nd: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held the Seventh Pastoral Area Work Conference. This conference was convened in the context of the basic realization of cooperativization in the region's animal husbandry and a bumper harvest in livestock production. It was a conference to implement the general line of socialist construction and mobilize all ethnic groups of herdsmen in the region to develop animal husbandry production at high speed. The conference, from beginning to end, adopted the methods of vigorous airing of views, big-character posters, and grasping typical examples for comparison, unfolding heated discussions around the three main issues of the struggle between the two roads in pastoral areas, cooperativization, and production.

The conference stipulated the tasks for pastoral area work in the coming period. These tasks are: 1. Continue to complete the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, consolidate and develop the socialist system of animal husbandry economy; 2. Strengthen the leadership of the Party, continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads, and actively complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts; 3. Actively realize the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and develop animal husbandry production at high speed; 4. Combine agriculture and animal husbandry, vigorously develop industry, and gradually eliminate the fundamental differences between pastoral areas and general areas.

The conference focused on discussing how to consolidate and develop the socialist system in pastoral areas. The conference analyzed the main contradictions existing within the current pastoral cooperatives and proposed seven measures to properly resolve these contradictions: strengthen the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, continue to carry out socialist education within the pastoral cooperatives, and make socialist democracy a regular system of the pastoral cooperatives; establish the leading advantage of working herdsmen in the pastoral cooperatives, and, centering on the poor and not yet wealthy working herdsmen, unite the wealthy herdsmen to jointly take the socialist road; correctly handle the proportion between public and private, the distribution of income, and public accumulation; the size of the cooperative should take into account the conditions of pasture and residence, based on the principles of being conducive to production and meeting the needs of the technical revolution; pastoral cooperatives must ensure the high-speed development of animal husbandry, increase the quantity and quality of livestock as much as possible, and implement the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, develop industry, and develop diversified operations; rectify the cooperatives two or three times a year; establish and improve Party branches.

Regarding the speed of animal husbandry development, the conference fully reflected the struggle between the two lines and two methods of achieving more, faster, better, and more economically versus less, slower, worse, and more expensively. Using a large number of vivid facts, it conducted a concentrated and forceful criticism of the erroneous viewpoints commonly held by cadres and the masses in pastoral areas, such as the invincibility of natural disasters, the impossibility of developing a large number of livestock due to the small population in pastoral areas, and the lack of prospects for agricultural areas to develop animal husbandry (i.e., the ideology of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry).

This conference was held from June 20th to July 9th in the grassland city of Xilinhot, presided over by Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee, who also made a concluding speech. The participants included the secretaries of the league and banner Party committees of the autonomous region, ministers of agriculture and animal husbandry, some sumu (district) Party committee secretaries, and directors of pastoral cooperatives, totaling one hundred and seventy-two people.

    内蒙古举行第七次牧区工作会议
    动员起来高速度发展畜牧生产
    据新华社呼和浩特22日电  中共内蒙古自治区委员会最近举行第七次牧区工作会议，这是在全区畜牧业基本实现了合作化和畜牧业大丰收的情形下召开的一次贯彻社会主义建设总路线、动员全区各族牧民高速度发展畜牧业生产的会议。会议自始至终采取大鸣大放大字报和抓典型、进行对比的方法，围绕牧区两条道路斗争和合作化、生产这三个主要问题展开了热烈的讨论。
    会议规定了今后一个相当时期内牧区的工作任务。这个工作任务就是：一、继续完成对畜牧业的社会主义改造，巩固和发展畜牧业经济的社会主义制度；二、加强党的领导，继续开展两条道路的斗争，积极完成政治战线上思想战线上的社会主义革命；三、积极实现技术革命和文化革命，高速度地发展畜牧业生产；四、农牧业结合，大力发展工业，逐步消灭牧区与一般地区的基本差别。
    会议着重讨论了如何巩固和发展牧区的社会主义制度问题。会议分析了当前牧业社内部存在的主要矛盾，提出了妥善地解决这些矛盾的七项措施：加强党的领导，政治挂帅，继续在牧业社内进行社会主义教育，并使社会主义民主成为牧业社的经常制度；在牧业社内树立劳动牧民的领导优势，并以贫苦的和还不富裕的劳动牧民为中心，团结富裕牧民共同走社会主义道路；正确处理公私比例、收益分配、公共积累问题；社的规模应照顾牧场、居住等条件，以有利于生产、适应技术革命需要为原则；牧业社必须保证畜牧业高速度发展，尽可能提高牲畜数量和质量，并实行农牧业结合，发展工业，发展多种经营；每年整社两三次；建立和健全党支部。
    关于畜牧业发展速度问题，会议充分反映了多快好省与少慢差费的两条路线、两种方法的斗争，以大量生动的事实对牧区干部和群众中比较普遍存在的自然灾害不可战胜论、牧区人少不能大量发展牲畜论、农业区发展畜牧业无前途论（即重农轻牧思想）等错误论点，进行了集中有力的批判。
    这次会议从6月20日到7月9日在草原城市锡林浩特举行，由内蒙古自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫主持，并作了总结。参加会议的有自治区各盟、旗党委书记，农牧部长，部分苏木（区）党委书记和牧业社主任等一百七十二人。
