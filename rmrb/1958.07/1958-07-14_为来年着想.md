Thinking Ahead for Next Year

This year, many of the agricultural tools created and improved in various places have not been widely promoted. A very important reason is the rapid transition of the production season (like the wheat harvest, which passes in just a few days). Time is too tight, and the promotion of a new tool requires a certain process of learning, imitation, trial use, mastering its performance, and even making various improvements.

If we missed it this year, we must catch up next year and not fall behind. The decisive step to achieve catching up is to learn from this year's experience, and with foresight and planning, select and vigorously promote the successfully tested agricultural tools related to local production in advance. Let these new agricultural tools attract widespread attention from the masses, allow sufficient time for discussion and experimentation, and possibly lead to even better improvements. In this way, the process of promoting new agricultural tools will no longer be a simple process of selling products, but a process of improving and enhancing the effectiveness of agricultural tools, and a process of implementing the mass line in agricultural tool reform. The relevant central departments decided to promote four types of rice transplanters nationwide for the same reason. From a production season perspective, it is now too late to promote rice transplanters to meet the production needs of various regions. However, paddy field areas should not ignore it because of this. They should still actively promote it, make prototypes, exhibit it everywhere, and demonstrate it everywhere. After the masses have seen its effects and the shortcomings to be overcome, they will promote and improve it themselves. By the next rice transplanting season, it may be widely promoted.

    为来年着想
    今年许多地方创造和改良的农具推广得较少，其中很重要的一个原因，就是生产季节转变迅速（像麦收几乎几天就过去了），时间过于紧迫，而一种新工具的推广，又还需要经过学习、仿制、试用、掌握性能，甚至还要作这样那样的改进，总需要一定的过程。
    今年没有赶上，明年一定得迎头赶上，不能落后。而实现迎头赶上的决定性的步骤，就是吸取今年的经验，有远见地、有计划地把试验成功的与本地生产有关的农具，提前选择出来，大力推广。让这些新农具引起群众广泛的注意，有充分的时间进行讨论、试验，并且也有可能因此得到更好的改进。这样，推广新农具的过程就不再是简单的推销产品的过程，而是改进和提高农具效能的过程，是贯彻农具改革走群众路线的过程。中央有关部门决定在全国推广四种插秧机，理由也是这样。从生产季节上说，现在推广插秧机已经赶不上各地的生产需要了。但是，水田地区不要因此忽视了它，仍应当积极推广，作出样子，到处展览，到处表演，让群众亲眼看到它的作用和尚待克服的缺点后，群众就会自己动手来推广它、改进它。而到明年插秧期间就有可能得到普遍推广。
