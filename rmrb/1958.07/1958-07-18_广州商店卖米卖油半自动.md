    Guangzhou Stores Use Semi-Automatic Rice and Oil Dispensers
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch: Stores in many areas of Guangdong Province have recently begun to universally use rice and oil dispensers that do not require scales and can accurately dispense fixed quantities by gravity flow. After using these new tools, a single salesperson can serve several customers at the same time, increasing work efficiency by one to several times, and reducing personnel by one-half to two-thirds compared to the original staffing.
    These new tools were created by Li Xiang, a young salesperson at the Lingdong Grain Purchasing and Marketing Station in Xinhui County. The rice dispenser is shaped like a large wooden box, with wooden boards dividing the interior into small compartments of various capacities. Each capacity compartment is equipped with a movable gate at the top and bottom, and a pipe at the top leads directly to the rice storage. Rice flows from the rice storage from a high position into the various capacity compartments of the rice dispenser. When selling rice, the gate above the capacity compartment is closed and the gate at the bottom is opened, and the required amount of rice flows into the customer's rice bag, ensuring accuracy.

    广州商店卖米卖油半自动
    新华社广州电　广东省许多地区的商店最近普遍使用不需磅秤、能准确地自流定量的售米器和售油器。各商店使用以后，一个营业员可以同时接待几位顾客，工作效率提高一倍到几倍，人员可比原来减少一半到三分之二。
    这些新工具是由新会县岭东粮食购销站的青年售货员李想创造出来的。售米器的外形像个大木箱，内部用木板分隔成各种容量的小格，各容量格上下端分别装置一活动闸板，顶端有管直通米库，大米即由米库从高向下流入售米器的各个容量格内。售米时，将容量格上方的闸板关闭和拉开下端的闸板，所需数量的大米即流进顾客的米袋里。而且保证准确。
