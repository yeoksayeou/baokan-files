	Song of the Great Leap Forward
	
	In the open-pit mine, locomotives travel back and forth day and night on the rails that traverse more than thirty miles from east to west. Drilling machines, coal-turning "cages", small coal cars, electric picks, and large winding machines are constantly turning and crawling.
	
	On the terraced coal seams, No. 12 pick is on the layer above No. 5 pick; two electric picks, like big black geese, stretch their necks and gnaw at the shiny coal seams on the face. Next to the picks, electric drills and electric locomotive heads pull more than a dozen coal-loading cars, like small snakes, whirring and turning.
	
	The electric locomotive seems to be intentionally creating conditions for the competition between No. 5 pick and No. 12 pick. Two rows of cars simultaneously enter the faces where these two electric picks are located. The two electric picks start loading cars almost at the same second. Bai Zhongyu, the driver of No. 12 pick, is just like a tank driver charging forward, moving the "brake lever" and directing the huge steel neck to move up and down; he extends the digging bucket (commonly known as "spoon head") connected to the top of the long neck into the coal seam; he uses its five huge steel teeth to gnaw, and then swallows some coal blocks from the coal mountain-like face into the digging bucket. One digging bucket is 1.8 tons of coal, and two buckets are one coal car. In this way, row after row of cars are filled and the electric locomotive drags them to the "cage".
	
	Even so, the comrades still feel that the loading is slow, and they want to shorten the time of loading one car from one and a half minutes to one minute, or even shorter.
	
	Li Zhenyou of No. 12 pick picked up the phone and told Xu Chengcai of No. 5 pick about this goal. Xu Chengcai replied: "Okay! Let's give it a try!"
	
	In the past, for electric pick operations, one driver operated the pick, one assistant watched over the cable behind the pick, and one assistant watched over the track outside the coal car. These three people counted the driver as the busiest. That night, they changed this way of working; Bai Zhongyu was operating the machine, and Li Zhenyou was also helping to release the iron rope of the "bucket" door next to the driver's platform, which reduced the burden on the driver Bai Zhongyu, allowing him to concentrate on operating the electric pick to dig and turn. When they loaded the second row of cars, they not only achieved one car per minute, but also dug the face very smoothly. After loading the second row of cars, Li Zhenyou picked up the phone and told Xu Chengcai: "Reporting good news to you, we have reached one car per minute!" At this time, the second row of cars of No. 5 pick had not yet been loaded, and the electric locomotive had not yet left the face. The electric car driver stomped his feet anxiously and said: "Master Jia (Jia Lianfu is driving No. 5 pick), we are behind…."
	
	That night, No. 5 pick loaded twenty-six rows of cars (1,196 tons of coal) and No. 12 pick loaded thirty rows of cars. As a result, No. 12 pick took the lead. The reason for the backwardness of No. 5 pick was: No. 5 pick was in a fire face (spontaneous combustion), the smoke was heavy, and it was difficult to see the car loading accurately. Another reason was: No. 5 pick was doing "groove pulling" (the car is on the face and the pick is below the face, loading cars upwards) operation, and driver Jia Lianfu was not proficient in "groove pulling".
	
	On the way home from get off work, Jia Lianfu was still secretly calculating the competition: "Bai Zhongyu, this young man, and I used to work on the same pick for two or three years! I was a sixth-grade worker when he was a fifth-grade worker. Looking at his vigor tonight, he is more dashing than me…" He remembered that since he and Bai Zhongyu separated to work on different picks, Bai Zhongyu had been working on "groove pulling" faces, but he himself rarely worked on "groove pulling" faces. He believed that this was one of the reasons why Bai Zhongyu was "superior"….
	
	While he was thinking about these things with his head down, someone patted him on the shoulder from behind. He turned his head and saw that it was Bai Zhongyu. He gave a thumbs up and praised: "Wow! You are truly a well-deserved loading king!"
	
	"Come on, Master Jia, don't tease me!"
	
	The questions the two people talked about along the way were difficult to understand if you were not an electric pick driver. Anyway, they were all terms related to the reasons for their victory or defeat that night. Finally, Bai Zhongyu agreed to tell Jia Lianfu the tricks of "groove pulling", and Jia Lianfu took the initiative to teach Bai Zhongyu self-repair and self-inspection.
	
	The next night shift, Bai Zhongyu and Jia Lianfu arrived at the face early. Bai Zhongyu first gave a practical operation demonstration.
	
	Bai Zhongyu jumped onto the pick, moved the "brake lever", and after the engine on the electric pick whirred, he pushed the "brake lever" around, and then inserted the "bucket" into the coal seam. When he turned the "brake lever" back, the "bucket" also raised high, turning directly above the coal car. As soon as the "bucket" door opened, accurately and without deviation, one "bucket" of coal fell into the coal car….
	
	While operating, Bai Zhongyu carefully instructed Jia Lianfu. At this time, Jia Lianfu was just like a small apprentice, concentrating on watching Bai Zhongyu's operation.
	
	After Bai Zhongyu finished the demonstration, Jia Lianfu carefully told Bai Zhongyu what to pay attention to and what problems could easily occur with the main components of the electric pick during maintenance. When it was time to take over the shift, the two people went to their own picks. The competition started again that night.
	
	Two rows of coal cars drove into the face at the same time again. The electric car driver of No. 5 face was gesturing with his hands to tell Jia Lianfu the loading speed of No. 12 pick. Xu Chengcai picked up the phone and asked Li Zhenyou: "How many minutes? How many have you loaded?"
	
	When it was time to change shifts, it was calculated that No. 5 pick had loaded thirty-one rows of cars (1,426 tons of coal, achieving an efficiency of three and a half minutes for four cars) and No. 12 pick had loaded twenty-seven rows of cars (1,242 tons of coal). As a result, No. 5 pick took the lead.
	
	On the third night, No. 12 pick ran ahead of No. 5 pick again. On the fourth night, No. 5 pick overtook No. 12 pick again. Bai Zhongyu continued to learn self-repair and self-inspection from Jia Lianfu, and Jia Lianfu asked Bai Zhongyu to "teach groove pulling" operation every day.
	
	The electric pick drivers made up a folk rhyme for the two of them:
		The loading king is full of energy,
		Determined to catch up with Jia Lianfu,
		When loading cars, he doesn’t give in,
		Sharing technology unreservedly.

	And for Jia Lianfu:
		Jia Lianfu is an old driver,
		Wants to compete with old Bai,
		Even though he doesn’t let people load the car,
		He teaches maintenance sincerely and honestly.

### 两台电镐比高低

    两台电镐比高低
    抚顺西露天矿　潘洪玉　胡万江
    露天矿坑里，东西横贯三十多里的铁轨上，机车无日无夜的来往穿行着，钻机，翻煤的“罐笼”，小型煤车，电镐，大卷机，电镐不停的转动着，爬行着……。
    在梯阶形的煤层上，十二号镐在五号镐的上一层；两台像大黑鹅一样的电镐，伸长脖子啃着掌子上的亮晶晶的煤层，镐的旁边电钻、电机车头拉着十多个装煤的小车，像一条条的小蛇，哗啦啦的转动着。
    电机车好像有意为五号镐和十二号镐的竞赛造条件，两排车同时开进这两台电镐的所在掌子里，两台电镐几乎是在同一秒钟里开始了装车。十二号镐里的司机白忠余简直像个坦克驾驶员在打冲锋，搬动着“闸把”，支使着那巨大的钢铁的长颈，忽上忽下；把连结在长颈顶端的掘斗（俗称“勺头”）伸进煤层；用它那五个巨大的钢牙啃着，于是从煤山样的掌子上吞到掘斗里一些煤块，一掘斗就是一点八吨煤，两斗就是一煤车，就这样一排车一排车的装满了，电机车拖着送到“罐笼”里。
    就这样，同志们还嫌装的慢，他们要从一分半钟装一个车缩短到一分钟，或者更短一点。
    十二号镐的李振有拿起电话把这个目标告诉给五号镐的徐成财。徐成财回答说：“好吧！咱们试试看！”
    往常电镐作业，是一个司机开镐，有一个助手在镐后面看管着电缆；一个助手在煤车外首看管着车道，这三个人数着司机最忙。这天晚上他们改变了这种干法；白忠余在操纵机器，李振有也在司机台旁边帮着坠开“挖斗”门的铁绳，这样就减轻了司机白忠余的负担，他可以集中精力去操纵着电镐挖、转动，等他们装第二排车的时候不仅达到了一分钟装一个车，掌子挖的也很平。装完了第二排车，李振有就操起电话告诉徐成财：“向你们报捷，我们已经达到了一分钟一个车！”这时候五号镐的第二排车还没装完，电机车还没出掌子，电车司机急的直跺脚说：“贾师傅（五号镐贾连富开镐）咱们落后了，……。”
    五号镐这天晚上装了二十六排车（一千一百九十六吨煤）十二号镐装了三十排车，结果是十二号镐占先。五号镐落后的原因是：五号镐是在火掌子里（自然发火）烟大，装车看不准，另一个原因是：五号镐是“拉沟”（车在掌子面上，镐在掌子下面，往上装车）作业，贾连富司机就是对“拉沟”不熟练。
    贾连富在下班的路上还暗暗的盘算竞赛的事：“白忠余这小伙子从前我俩在一个镐上干了二、三年哪！他五级工的时候我就六级工了，要看起今天晚上这个劲头比我洒脱……。”他想起来了，他自从和白忠余分开镐干，白忠余一直在干“拉沟”的掌子，他自己却很少干“拉沟”的掌子。他认为这是白忠余“居上”的原因之一，……。
    他正在低着头想这些事的时候，身背后有人拍了一下他的肩膀，回头一看却正是白忠余，他竖着大姆指叫好：“吓！真是名不虚传的装车大王啊！”
    “得，贾师傅，别逗我了！”
    两个人一路上谈的问题，如果你不是个电镐司机很难听懂他们说了些什么。反正都是属于他们当天晚间的胜负原因的术语，最后，白忠余答应把“拉沟”的窍门告诉给贾连富，贾连富主动的要教给白忠余自修自检。
    第二天夜班，白忠余和贾连富提前来到了掌子里，白忠余先给来了个实际操作表演。
    白忠余跳到镐上，搬动“闸把”，电镐上的发动机哒哒的响起来以后，他又把“闸把”推了一周，于是就把“勺斗”插进了煤层，他把“闸把”转回来的时候“勺斗”也高高的举起，一直转到煤车的上面，“勺斗”门一开，不偏不正，一“勺斗”煤都落进煤车里，……。
    白忠余一面操作一面细心的嘱咐着贾连富，这时候的贾连富简直像一个小徒弟，集中精神盯着白忠余的操作。
    白忠余表演完了，贾连富就把检修电镐的主要部件应该注意什么，发动机容易发生的故障细致的告诉给白忠余。该到接班的时候两个人才分别上了自己的镐，这一宿的竞赛又开始了。
    两排煤车又同时驶入掌子。五号掌子的电车司机又在用手比划着告诉贾连富：十二号镐装车的速度，徐成财操起来电话问着李振有：“几分钟？装了几个了？”
    到该换班的时候一计算：五号镐装了三十一排车（1426吨煤，达到了三分半钟四车的效率）十二号镐装了二十七排车（1 242吨煤），结果是五号镐占先。
    第三天晚上十二号镐又跑在五号镐前边，第四天晚上五号镐又撵过了十二号镐。白忠余还是继续找贾连富学自修自检，贾连富天天找白忠余“教拉沟”的操作。
    电镐司机们给他俩编成顺口溜说：
        装车大王干劲足，
        立志赶过贾连富，
        装起车来不让份，
        传授技术不保守。给贾连富编的：
        贾连富是老司机，
        要和老白比高低，
        别看装车不让人，
        教检修实心实意。
