Housewives Delve into Science and Technology
Wuhan's Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen Successfully Trial-Produce Chemical Raw Material Oxalic Acid

(By our reporter Zhang Wei) Wuhan is currently spreading an extremely inspiring piece of news: two ordinary housewives, Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen, broke the superstition surrounding scientific research. They boldly used sawdust to trial-produce the chemical raw material oxalic acid, and after fifty days of hard work, they succeeded at the end of June with the help of teachers and students from the Chemistry Department of Wuhan University.

Oxalic acid is a chemical raw material that can be used to manufacture dozens of industrial products such as leather, pure glycerin, and paper. It can also be used for bleaching, stain removal, and rust removal. Currently, China does not have domestically produced, low-cost oxalic acid made from sawdust; most of it is imported.

Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen are residents of Shouyi Road in Wuchang District. Zhan Shuquan is the director of the residents' committee. How did they think of manufacturing oxalic acid? In April and May of this year, residents of streets across the city responded to the government's call to set up industries to organize production and self-reliance. Many people advised Zhan Shuquan to organize everyone to weave bamboo baskets, make raincoats, process old cotton, and make straw ropes. She felt that many residents' committees were already doing this kind of production, so it would be best to find other production avenues. She heard from a comrade in the Civil Affairs Bureau that someone in Hunan had successfully trial-produced oxalic acid using waste sawdust. At the same time, she heard that China was very short of oxalic acid and that it had a wide range of uses, so she decided to go to Changsha to "learn the ropes." Through the introduction of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, she and residents' group leader Yang Juzhen went to Changsha. After arriving in Changsha, they learned that the Changsha Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers' Families' Masonry Production Cooperative had not successfully trial-produced oxalic acid. They had to copy the simple textual material of about one or two hundred words related to the manufacture of oxalic acid and return, determined to try it themselves.

Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen only had a first-year junior high school education, and they are now both around forty years old, but they have enough confidence in trial-producing oxalic acid. They said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, there are many examples of laymen becoming experts. We ordinary housewives must also break superstition and study chemistry." So Yang Juzhen's bedroom became a laboratory. They used old tin water ladles as cooking pots, made a lid at a tin shop, drilled a hole in the lid and inserted a thermometer; used small medicine bottles as measuring cups, and the holes where teacups were placed on the armrests of rattan chairs became racks for funnels. Without filter paper, Yang Juzhen tore off the bottom hem of her old silk gown, sewed it into a bag, and hung it on the door latch to filter. They also borrowed stirring rods, funnels, balances, evaporating dishes, etc. from nearby agencies and schools. Some people, hearing that they were going to trial-produce oxalic acid, said disapprovingly, "What the hell, what are you old women doing with oxalic acid?" They just smiled: "Are only intellectuals allowed to do science? We'll show you when we succeed." They overcame all difficulties, and after getting sawdust and buying raw materials such as caustic soda, lime, and sulfuric acid, the chemical experiment work immediately began. Oxalic acid is a pure white crystalline substance, but the first pot produced a bottle of soy sauce-like black water, resulting in failure. They were not discouraged at all. They experimented more than a dozen times in a row, while appropriately controlling the temperature. After asking the students to accurately calculate the composition of the raw materials, the manufactured liquid slowly turned light yellow, containing oxalic acid, and could bleach and remove rust. However, the components contained in the liquid were not pure, and no matter what, they could not crystallize into white needle-like crystals. They stayed by the scorching stove day and night to experiment, but they could not succeed. Later, they went to the Hubei Provincial Library to look through magazines and find chemistry teachers at schools, but they could not solve the problem of crystallization. At this time, Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Li Erzong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, and the Secretary of the Wuchang District Party Committee, and other party leaders at all levels, personally came to their home to visit. After learning about their difficulties, they immediately sent them to live at Wuhan University, and designated teachers and students from the Chemistry Department to specifically help them solve the problem, and they would return only after they succeeded. Teachers and students from the Chemistry Department of Wuhan University, together with them, went through more than ten days and nights of experiments, found the reason why the solution could not crystallize. On the morning of June 30, white, needle-like crystals appeared. After testing, the oxalic acid they manufactured using sawdust was of better quality than the oxalic acid produced in Japan.

On July 14, the chemical plant producing oxalic acid on Shouyi Road in Wuchang officially started operation. Zhan Shuquan and Yang Juzhen serve as production guides.

    家庭妇女钻研科学技术
    武汉詹淑权和杨菊珍试制化学原料草酸成功
    本报讯　记者张碨报道：武汉市正传颂着一件非常鼓舞人心的新闻：两个普普通通的家庭妇女詹淑权、杨菊珍打破了科学研究的迷信，大胆用锯末试制化学原料草酸，经过五十天的刻苦努力，6月底在武汉大学化学系师生帮助下获得了成功。
    草酸是一种化学原料，可以用来制造皮革、纯甘油、纸张等几十种工业用品，还能褪色、漂白、擦铁锈等。目前，我国还没有用锯末自造的成本低廉的草酸，主要是用的进口货。
    詹淑权和杨菊珍是武昌区首义路的居民，詹淑权是居民委员会主任。她们怎么会想起制造草酸呢？今年4、5月份，全市各街道居民纷纷响应政府号召自办工业组织生产自救，许多人劝詹淑权组织大家编竹篓、打蓑衣、加工旧棉花、打草绳子等。她觉得这样的生产，许多居民委员会都已经搞起来了，最好还是找别的生产门路。她在民政局一个同志那里打听到湖南有人利用废物锯末试制草酸成功了，同时听说我国很缺草酸，它的用途又广，所以决心去长沙“取经”。经市民政局的介绍，她和居民组长杨菊珍一起去长沙。到长沙后，才知道长沙烈军属麻石生产合作社试制草酸并没有成功。只好抄下那一、二百字的简单的有关制造草酸的文字材料回来，决心自己试制。
    詹淑权和杨菊珍都只有初中一年级的文化程度，而她们现在也都是四十左右的人了，但对试制草酸却有足够的信心。她们说：“在共产党领导下，外行变内行的例子多得很，我们这些普通的家庭妇女也要破除迷信研究研究化学。”于是杨菊珍的卧室变成了试验室，她们用旧的白铁水舀子当烧锅，在洋铁铺做了个盖子，又在盖子上钻个洞插温度计；用小药瓶当量杯，藤椅扶手把上放茶杯的洞洞成了放漏斗的架子。没有过滤纸，杨菊珍撕下了自己的旧绸褂子的底襟，缝成袋子挂在门拴上过滤。还到附近机关、学校借来搅棒、漏斗、天平、蒸发皿等。有的人听说她们要试制草酸，很不以为然地说：“真见鬼，你们这些姑娘婆婆们搞什么草酸？”她们只笑笑：“难道只许你们知识分子搞科学？等我们搞成功了给你们看。”她们排除了一切困难，在弄来了锯末和买来了烧碱、石灰、硫酸等原料之后，化学试验工作立即开始了。草酸是纯白色结晶体，但第一锅制出了一瓶像酱油样的黑水，结果失败了。她们一点不灰心，一连试验十几次，同时适当控制了温度，又请学生们精确计算了原料的成分后，制造出来的液体已慢慢变成了浅黄色，含有草酸，并且可以褪色、擦铁锈等。但是，液体所含成分不纯，无论如何也不能结成为白色针状晶体。她们日夜守在炙热的炉子旁边试验，也不能成功。后来她们又到湖北省图书馆翻杂志，找学校的化学老师，都解决不了结晶的问题。这时，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、武汉市委书记李尔重、武昌区委书记等各级党的领导人，都亲自来她们家里参观。在了解了她们的困难之后，立即把她们送到武汉大学住下，并指定由化学系师生具体帮助她们解决问题，一直到成功再回来。武汉大学化学系师生和她们一起，经过了十多天日夜的试验，找出了溶液不能结晶的原因，6月30日那天早晨，白生生一条条的针状结晶便出现了。经过检验后，他们利用锯末制造出来的草酸，比日本产的草酸的质量还要优良。
    7月14日武昌首义路生产草酸的化工厂正式开工，詹淑权、杨菊珍担任生产指导。
