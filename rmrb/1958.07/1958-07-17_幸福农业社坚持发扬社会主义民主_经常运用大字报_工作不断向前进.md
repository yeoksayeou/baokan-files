Happiness Agricultural Cooperative Persists in Promoting Socialist Democracy
　　Frequently Uses Big-Character Posters, and Continuously Advances its Work

　　(Our Newspaper News) Reporter Fang Yang reports: How can big-character posters in rural areas be made a regular occurrence? And how can we mobilize the masses through big-character posters to conduct open discussions and debates on current issues, unify thinking, raise awareness, and promote work? The Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in Shigou Township, Sihui County, Guangdong Province, has set an example.

　　This Happiness Agricultural Cooperative, known as the "Big-Character Poster Village," with more than 500 households, focused on the key issue of fertilizer accumulation in its late rice planting preparation work, proposing a combat task of 1,500 dan of fertilizer accumulation per mu. But could this task be completed? And how could it be completed? Based on the experience of using big-character posters on a large scale to promote the elimination of third-class seedlings in early rice, the cooperative committee decided to bring this issue to the masses, mobilize them to write big-character posters for open discussions and debates. As soon as this fertilizer accumulation task was proposed, the members began to discuss it. At that time, the first prominent issue was to criticize the thinking that there was no fertilizer to accumulate. As a result, more than 1,000 big-character posters were posted in one evening, and everyone with serious right-leaning conservative thinking on the fertilizer accumulation issue became the object of big-character poster criticism. Gao Wangdi, captain of the "Mulan Commando Team," used "Verbal Battle with Gao Huozhu" as the title to criticize Gao Huozhu, saying: "Huozhu of Group One talks about fertilizer accumulation, lacks courage and is unmotivated, saying that 'even if we dig up the mountains, we won't be able to accumulate enough,' I say there is plenty of fertilizer in front of and behind the houses. Let's work hard together to build, and guarantee the completion of 150,000 jin of fertilizer per mu!" Member Chen Sendi suggested "seeking fertilizer from the water," publishing a big-character poster offering advice, saying: "The Suijiang River flows slowly, flowing to Benxu (referring to Shigouxu) Murongtou (place name), bringing hundreds of millions of fertile mud, with high fertilizer efficiency and thick mud layer, who dares to say there is no fertilizer to accumulate, it is actually conservatism." Member Hailin added: "The mountain behind the house is high and big, covered with lush greenery; green leaves can be used as green manure, as long as everyone goes up the mountain to hook with sickles. Changling Ditch, the water flows long, the mud at the bottom of the ditch is so fertile it stinks, members quickly use ? to hook it up. As long as the mind is greatly liberated, the source of fertilizer is indeed there." At the same time, the cooperative committee also organized an exhibition of local miscellaneous fertilizers. After the big-character posters were used for open discussions and debates, those who originally said there was no fertilizer to accumulate, some had nothing to say, and quietly threw themselves into the fertilizer accumulation movement, and some also wrote big-character posters to make self-criticisms.

　　After the idea that there was no fertilizer to accumulate was overcome and the fertilizer accumulation movement had begun, how to improve fertilizer accumulation efficiency became the central content of the second open discussion and debate using big-character posters. At this time, whoever was not actively accumulating fertilizer would be criticized by big-character posters. For example, one big-character poster criticizing Huang Muhuo for not paying attention to fertilizer accumulation said: "Fighting hard day and night to overcome the fertilizer barrier, everyone is working diligently without resting; only member Huang Muhuo, regards fertilizer accumulation as a leisurely task; wholeheartedly going to the private plot, picking vegetables and setting up stalls on the street. I ask, if everyone learns from you, how can grain production be increased several times? I hope you will correct yourself immediately, and take quick action without delay." After being criticized, Huang Muhuo immediately wrote a big-character poster entitled "Determination to Correct" in reply, saying: "Members criticize me for being lazy in accumulating fertilizer, the facts are completely true. All because personal interests are important, from now on I am determined to correct. Throw myself into the fertilizer accumulation movement, putting the public first and personal interests second is the right thing to do, everyone supervise my actions." Those who actively accumulated fertilizer were praised by big-character posters. For example, member Zeng Liandi's big-character poster "Praising Yan Senge" said: "Yan Senge is active in his work, accumulating fertilizer and washing toilets every day; he can both clean and accumulate fertilizer, he truly loves the cooperative like his home!"

　　However, the real high tide of pushing the fertilizer accumulation movement to a climax through big-character posters was after the cooperative committee grasped the development of the "Learning from 'Mulan,' Criticizing Wu Xueqi" movement. This cooperative had a "Mulan Commando Team" organized entirely by women. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, this team averaged 76,000 jin of fertilizer accumulation per person per day, which was an advanced model. At the same time, a backward model appeared in the form of member Wu Xueqi who opposed digging mud from private plots to make fertilizer and scattered broken glass in his own vegetable garden. The cooperative committee immediately seized these two distinct opposites and launched a large-scale debate through big-character posters. In the debate, there were 3,000 big-character posters criticizing Wu Xueqi alone. Under the criticism of the masses, Wu Xueqi admitted his mistakes. Later, he used his brain and converted old cylindrical beehives into granular fertilizer tumblers, which improved work efficiency and overfulfilled the fertilizer production task.

　　In this late rice planting preparation work centered on fertilizer accumulation, the Happiness Agricultural Cooperative organized more than 20,000 big-character posters for open discussions, debates and airing of views. Because the big-character posters effectively promoted production, the fertilizer accumulation movement of the whole cooperative increased from the original plan of an average of 1,500 dan per mu to 2,000 dan.

　　Now, writing big-character posters has become a trend in this cooperative. When members see that something is not right with what others are doing, they say: "I'll put up a big-character poster about you!" When going to the fields, if they see any problems in production, they will come back and ask the scorekeeper to help them write a big-character poster. After switching to summer harvesting and planting, there were more than 800 big-character posters in two days discussing the issue of careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, an average of more than one and a half posters per household. Now members generally reflect: If we criticize someone in a meeting, no one will raise so many opinions! Cadres also said that with big-character posters, work is much easier to do.

　　Zhao Ziyang, head of the Central and Northern Road Agricultural Inspection Team of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and secretary of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, visited the big-character posters of this cooperative and believed that this was a new development of big-character posters. He hoped that leaders at all levels could organize cadres to learn from the experience of the Happiness Cooperative.

### 幸福农业社坚持发扬社会主义民主  经常运用大字报　工作不断向前进

    幸福农业社坚持发扬社会主义民主
    经常运用大字报　工作不断向前进
    本报讯　记者方暘报道：如何使农村的大字报经常化？并且通过大字报发动群众，进行当前问题的鸣放辩论，统一思想，提高认识，推动工作？广东省四会县石狗乡幸福农业社做出了榜样。
    这个被称为“大字报村庄”、拥有五百多户的幸福农业社，在晚造备耕工作中，突出地抓住了积肥这个关键问题，提出每亩积肥一千五百担的战斗任务。但是这个任务能不能完成？如何完成？社委会根据前段大规模地运用大字报推动消灭早造三类禾的经验，决定把这个问题拿到群众中去，发动群众写大字报进行鸣放辩论。这个积肥任务一提出，社员便议论开了。当时突出的第一个问题，便是要批判无肥可积的思想。于是一个晚上，就贴出大字报一千多张，一切在积肥问题上有严重右倾保守思想的人，都成了大字报鸣放的对象。“花木兰突击队”队长高旺娣以“舌战高火珠”为题批评高火珠说：“一组火珠讲积肥，缺乏勇气无心机，讲出‘挖平山头都积不到’，我说屋前屋后大把肥。建设齐心合力来苦战，保证完成每亩十五万斤肥！”社员陈森娣建议“向水要肥”，发表大字报献计说：“绥江河水慢慢流，流到本圩（指石狗圩）木榕头
  （地名），带来肥泥千百万，肥效高、泥层厚，谁人敢说无肥积，实际是保守。”社员海林补充说：“屋背山，高又大，遍地绿油油；青叶做绿肥，只要大家上山用镰勾。长岭圳，水长流，圳底泥，肥到臭，社员快用?来勾。只要思想大解放，肥源的确有。”与此同时，社委会还结合举办了一个土杂肥展览会。经过大字报大鸣大放，原说无肥可积的，有的已无话可说，悄悄地投入了积肥运动，有的还写了大字报作检讨。
    当无肥可积的思想已被克服，积肥运动已经展开了之后，如何提高积肥效率，便成了大字报第二个鸣放辩论的中心内容。这个时候，谁积肥不够积极，就会受到大字报的批评。如有一张批评黄木火不重视积肥的大字报说：“日夜苦战攻肥关，个个出勤不休闲；唯有社员黄木火，看作积肥是好闲；一心走向自留地，摘菜上街摆摊贩。试问人人都学你，粮食怎能翻几番？望你立即来改正，迅速行动亦未晚。”黄木火受到批评后，立即写了“决心改正”的大字报答复说：“社员鸣我积肥懒，完全事实我承认。皆因个人利益重，从今决心来改正。投入积肥个运动，先公后私才对头，大家监督我行动。”积极积肥的，则受到大字报的表扬。如社员曾连弟“表扬严森哥”的大字报说：“工作积极严森哥，每天积肥洗厕所；既能清洁又积肥，爱社如家真不错！”
    但是，真正通过大字报高潮把积肥运动推向高潮，是在社委会抓住开展“学习‘花木兰’，批判伍学琦”运动之后。这个社有一个完全由妇女组织的“花木兰突击组”，在积肥运动中，这个组平均每人日积肥七万六千斤，这是一个先进的典型。与此同时，却出现了一个社员伍学琦因反对挖自留地的泥去做肥料而撒碎玻璃在自己的菜园地上的落后典型。社委会立即抓住这两个鲜明的对立面，通过大字报大张旗鼓地展开了一场大辩论。在辩论中，单是批判伍学琦的大字报便有三千张。在群众的批判下，伍学琦承认了错误，以后，并开动脑筋，用旧的圆筒蜜蜂箱改制成颗粒肥滚筒，提高了工作效率，超额完成了制肥任务。
    幸福农业社在这次以积肥为中心的晚造备耕工作中，共组织了二万多张大字报进行大鸣大放大辩论。由于通过大字报有力地推动了生产，使全社的积肥运动由原计划每亩平均一千五百担增加到二千担。
    现在，写大字报在这个社里已经成为风气。社员看见别人做的事情不对头，就说：“贴你一张大字报！”下田时，看见生产上有什么问题，回来就叫记分员帮他写张大字报。转入夏收夏种以后，单是辩论细收细打的问题，两天内就出了大字报八百多张，平均每户一张半还多。现在社员普遍反映：如果开会批评谁，谁也不会提这样多意见！干部也说，有了大字报工作好做得多了。
    中共广东省委中、北路农业检查团团长，中共广东省委书记赵紫阳同志参观了这个社的大字报后，认为这是大字报的新发展，希望各级领导能好好的组织干部学习幸福社这个经验。
