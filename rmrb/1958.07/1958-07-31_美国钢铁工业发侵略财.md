Xinhua News Agency, New York, 30th: The American magazine "Steel" said on the 28th that the US armed intervention in Lebanon had a "major stimulating effect" on the US steel industry, which had "poor sales for several months." Many buyers increased orders for fear that the US aggression "might erupt into war." The magazine said that another direct result of the Middle East crisis might be rising steel prices. US Steel is now waiting for the market to be more bullish in order to announce steel price increases.

The magazine also said that due to overproduction, the situation of steel supply falling short of demand in the United States is impossible at present, and this situation "can only occur in wartime."

    美国钢铁工业发侵略财
    据新华社30日讯　纽约消息：美国“钢业”杂志28日说，美国武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动对于“好几个月销路不佳”的美国钢铁工业起了一个“主要的刺激作用”，许多购买者由于害怕美国的侵略行动“可能会爆发为战争”而增加了订货。这家杂志说，中东危机的另一个直接结果可能是钢铁涨价，美国钢铁公司现在正在等待市场更加看涨以便宣布钢铁涨价。
    杂志又说，由于生产过剩，美国钢铁供不应求的情况在目前是不可能发生的，这种情况“只可能在战争时期发生”。
