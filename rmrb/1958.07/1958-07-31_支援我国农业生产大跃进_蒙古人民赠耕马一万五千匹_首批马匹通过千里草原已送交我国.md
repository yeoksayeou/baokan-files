Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 29th. Today, it was learned from the Mongolian Ministry of Commerce that the first batch of more than 2,400 plough horses donated by Mongolia to China and sold to China this year has recently been handed over to the Chinese side on the Sino-Mongolian border.

The Mongolian government decided this year to donate 15,000 horses to China and sell another 15,000 horses to China. Since the beginning of June, the relevant Mongolian departments have been inspecting horses in twelve provinces. The horse inspection work ended in early July, and the horses were immediately driven to the two handover stations on the Sino-Mongolian border. Many horses had to travel thousands of miles of grassland to reach the handover station.

In order to support China's socialist construction, Mongolian herdsmen are selling strong horses to the state. Now is the season when pastures are lush, and the horses are being herded and grazed on the grasslands, and their fat will increase even more.

    支援我国农业生产大跃进
    蒙古人民赠耕马一万五千匹
    首批马匹通过千里草原已送交我国
    新华社乌兰巴托29日电　今天从蒙古商业部获悉：蒙古赠送给中国的耕马和今年出售给中国的耕马中的第一批共二千四百多匹，最近已经在中蒙边境交给中国方面。
    蒙古政府今年决定赠送给中国一万五千匹马，另外卖给中国一万五千匹。从6月初开始，蒙古有关部门就在十二个省份验马。7月初，验马工作结束，各地随即把马赶到中蒙边境的两个接交站。许多马匹要走过千里草原才能到达接交站。
    为了支援中国的社会主义建设，蒙古牧民们把健壮的马匹销售给国家。现在正是牧草茂盛的季节，马匹在草原上边赶边放，膘肥将更加增加。
