    Good Times on July 1st, Sing a Folk Song to Express My Heart
    My Heart Faces the Communist Party
    Good Times on July 1st,
    Sing a folk song to express my heart,
    I have now gained the day of liberation,
    And will never forget the Communist Party.
          (Jiangxi, Yuan Zhaoxing)
    Sunflower, sunflower, golden yellow,
    Each flower blooms like the sun,
    The sunflower is the heart of ten thousand people,
    With our hearts facing the Communist Party!
                    (Southern Sichuan)
    Wax plum blossoms fresh and new,
    Chairman Mao is in Beijing,
    Even though we are separated by thousands of miles,
    The people's hearts are linked to yours.
                (Suichuan, Jiangxi)
    Green pines and cypresses fear no thunder,
    They do not wither in wind and rain,
    The Communist Party is like pine and cypress trees,
    Evergreen for ten thousand years.
              (Taixian, Jiangsu)
    Xintianyou Sent to Chairman Mao
    The wild geese flying south, the wind blowing north,
    Xintianyou sent to Chairman Mao to listen;
    Sandan flowers bloom all over the mountains,
    Our northern Shaanxi has become a gold and silver nest;
    Built water canals and erected embankments,
    Herds of cattle and sheep roam the mountains;
    The songs of the Great Leap Forward fill the sky,
    Human power will surely conquer nature;
    Xintianyou, never ending,
    We no longer worry about life;
    Pagoda Mountain is high, and the Yan River is long,
    The Communist Party is our dear parents.
              (Shaanxi, Guo Hua)
    Thinking of the Party When Holding the Rice Bowl
    A pancake and a bowl of soup,
    Thinking of the Party when holding the rice bowl;
    Everyone says their parents are dear,
    But the Party, it is dearer than our own parents.
    Patches of dark clouds cover the blue sky,
    The boundless sea of bitterness has no end;
    It was the Party that rescued us,
    And we jumped out of the sea of bitterness and gained warmth.
    A red flag flutters in the wind,
    The cooperative is the road to happiness;
    The days are getting better day by day,
    And life is improving step by step.
    Thinking of the past makes my heart ache,
    Eating vegetables mixed with chaff all year round;
    After joining the cooperative, our food and drink have improved,
    It's fragrant in our mouths and sweet in our hearts.
    Half a broken room with wind blowing from all sides,
    Cold as ice when it rains and snows;
    Now we have new tiled houses,
    Sunshine shines warmly everywhere.
    A patched-up jacket, piece by piece,
    The whole family shared it;
    Now life has become beautiful,
    And the children are dressed like flowers.
        (Fengxian, Jiangsu, Zhao Jiaxiang)
    The Sun's Rays are Ten Thousand Zhang Long
    The sun is red, the sun is bright,
    The sun's rays are ten thousand zhang long.
    We now have two suns,
    The two suns are not the same,
    One sun lives in Beijing,
    And one sun hangs in the sky,
    The sun in the sky warms our bodies,
    The sun in Beijing warms our hearts.
          (Shandong, Guo Chengqing)
    With the Communist Party, the river flows upwards;
    With the Communist Party, reservoirs are built on the mountains,
    With the Communist Party, fruit trees grow all over the mountains;
    With the Communist Party, mountain crops are strong;
    With the Communist Party, cattle and sheep fill the hillsides;
    With the Communist Party, every family has surplus grain.
                      (Shandong)
    Rely on the Party, Not on Heaven
    With the Communist Party, we celebrate a bumper harvest every year,
    If you want to be richer, rely on the Party, not on heaven.
                    (Zhejiang)
    Since the Communist Party took the helm,
    Herbs grow on ten miles of barren mountains,
    Rice paddies are plentiful in front of nine miles of slopes,
    Every man marries a wife.
                (Shizhu, Sichuan)
    Carrying grain on our shoulders, we are full of joy,
    Every load of grain shines with golden light,
    The golden light shines in our hearts,
    And we think of the Communist Party.
              (Macheng, Hubei)
    A river of stream water flows turbulently,
    No one has harnessed it for thousands of years,
    The leadership of the Communist Party is good,
    Irrigating hundreds of acres of fertile land.
              (Xuyong, Sichuan)
    Hero Flowers Bloom Relying on the East Wind
    Hero flowers bloom relying on the east wind,
    Ten thousand rays of rosy clouds fill the sky,
    Who did the Yao people rely on to turn themselves over,
    All thanks to our benefactor, Mao Zedong.
          (Dongkou Yao Autonomous County, Hunan)
    Flowers bloom in Beijing city,
    And the deep valleys of Liangshan smell their fragrance,
    The red flag flies over Beijing city,
    And red light reflects on the mountains of Liangshan.
                (Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture)
    Chairman Mao has arrived,
    Heaven has changed, and earth has changed.
    Look, the soil and water have also changed.
    In previous years, it was dry dam land,
    Now it is a vast expanse of water,
    Duckweed floats on the water,
    Like colorful clouds falling from the sky,
    We wish you longevity like the sun.
                    (Miao Nationality)

    七月一日好时光  唱首山歌表心肠
    心心朝向共产党
    七月一日好时光，
    唱首山歌表心肠，
    我今得到翻身日，
    永远不忘共产党。
          （江西　袁兆兴）
    葵花葵花金子黄，
    朵朵开花像太阳，
    葵花就是万人心呵，
    心心朝向共产党！
                    （川南）
    腊梅开花朵朵新，
    毛主席啊在北京，
    那怕路隔千万里，
    人民和您心连心。
                （江西遂川）
    青松翠柏不怕雷，
    风吹雨打不枯黄，
    共产党好比松柏树，
    四季常青万年长。
              （江苏泰县）
    信天游捎给毛主席
    南来的大雁北去的风，
    信天游捎给毛主席听；
    山丹丹开花满山坡，
    咱陕北变成金银窝；
    修起水渠打起埝，
    一群群牛羊满山窜；
    跃进歌声飞满天，
    人力定要战胜天；
    信天游，不断头，
    如今的生活不发愁；
    宝塔山高延水长，
    共产党是我们亲爹娘。
              （陕西　郭桦）
    端起饭碗想起党
    一张煎饼一碗汤，
    端起饭碗想起党；
    人人都说爹娘亲，
    党呀，胜过亲爹娘。
    片片乌云遮蓝天，
    茫茫苦海没有边；
    是党把俺来搭救，
    跳出苦海得温暖。
    一面红旗迎风飘，
    合作社来幸福道；
    日子一天比一天好，
    生活步步得提高。
    想起从前心里酸，
    常年吃菜把糠咽；
    入了社吃喝得改善，
    嘴上香哟心里甜。
    半间破房四面风，
    下雨下雪冷冰冰；
    如今换上新瓦房，
    阳光普照暖烘烘。
    一件破袄片连片，
    全家几口合着穿；
    如今生活变美了，
    儿女打扮得花枝般。
        （江苏丰县　赵家祥）
    太阳的光芒万万丈
    太阳红，太阳亮，
    太阳的光芒万万丈。
    我们如今俩太阳，
    两个太阳不一样，
    一个太阳住北京，
    一个太阳挂天上，
    天上的太阳暖身上，
    北京的太阳暖心房。
          （山东　郭澄清）
    有了共产党，河水往上淌；
    有了共产党，水库修山上，
    有了共产党，遍山果树长；
    有了共产党，山地庄稼强；
    有了共产党，牛羊满山岗；
    有了共产党，家家有余粮。
                      （山东）
    靠党不靠天
    有了共产党，岁岁庆丰年，
    要想更富裕，靠党不靠天。
                    （浙江）
    自从共产党来掌舵，
    十里荒山出草药，
    九里坡前稻田多，
    个个男子娶老婆。
                （四川石砫）
    肩挑谷子喜洋洋，
    担担谷子闪金光，
    金光照在心坎上，
    心里想起共产党。
              （湖北麻城）
    一江溪水混混流，
    数千年来无人收，
    共产党的领导好，
    灌溉良田数百丘。
              （四川叙永）
    英雄花开靠东风
    英雄花开靠东风，
    万道霞光满天红，
    瑶族翻身靠那个，
    全靠恩人毛泽东。
          （湖南洞口瑶族）
    北京城里开着花，
    凉山深谷闻到香，
    北京城头飘红旗，
    凉山山上映红光。
                （凉山彝族）
    毛主席来到了，
    天变了，地变了。
    你看这水土也变了。
    往年还是干坝田，
    如今一片水汪汪，
    浮萍漂在水面上，
    好像天上落下来的采云，
    愿您像太阳一样长寿。
                    （苗族）
