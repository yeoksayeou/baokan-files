Sir, why don't you go and try!
    Liu Feng
    According to a report in the Guangming Daily: There is a hydraulic engineer in Tianjin who doesn't believe that the masses can build many water gates using "local methods." He said: "Although some have been built, it's like someone with a disease being cured by someone who hasn't studied medicine; it's just a lucky coincidence."
    Saying the masses "haven't studied" clearly implies that he has studied and is knowledgeable. But I wonder if he understands that even the textbook knowledge of natural science comes entirely from the practice of production struggle, and practice is the source of textbooks. That is to say: the textbooks he reveres are still accumulations of the creation and experience of countless masses. The masses don't have the knowledge possessed by professors, but they also have the knowledge that professors don't; they haven't read any textbooks, but they have their own professional knowledge; they haven't mastered any literature, but they have conducted their own investigations and research; naturally, they are not bound by any rules and regulations, and they boldly imagine, boldly practice, and boldly create, finally solving the problem.
    Building water gates certainly requires a lot of knowledge, such as mechanics and knowledge about water and soil. But this knowledge does not come from the minds of self-proclaimed "experts," but from practice. Therefore, it can be learned through self-study, although it is difficult, it is not impossible. The masses see floods causing disasters, waterlogging causing disasters, or droughts without rain, while some self-proclaimed experts are helpless, or unwilling to come up with solutions, waiting for a price to be estimated. Therefore, they think of ways to build water conservancy projects and water gates to regulate water volume. The solution is then found. These methods are naturally both suitable for the needs of the masses and in line with scientific principles.
    However, these are not necessarily found in books; it is a kind of "unwritten knowledge." This kind of knowledge is more suitable for the situation at that time and place, and can better meet the needs of that time and place, than all the dead things in books. This kind of knowledge generated by the needs of the situation is the most practical and useful knowledge. In the eyes of that hydraulic engineer, it seems that only things that have been specifically studied can be done, and only things that have been taught by a teacher can be done. In essence, he looks down on experts from the working people, and believes that only experts who come from schools and have the title of "hydraulic engineer" are truly the real deal. A famous brand name cannot scare people; the people ask what kind of goods you are selling in your shop? Actual needs are the best test and identification of true and false experts. In fact, some have the title of "hydraulic engineer" but have made no contribution to water conservancy, while the masses have made achievements without a title. Losing and refusing to admit defeat honestly, but instead slandering with a bad conscience, saying: "That was a lucky coincidence." People can't help but ask: Sir, please go and try to see what happens? You are a specially trained engineer with a title, why didn't you have a lucky coincidence? Another recent example can be cited, which is on the July 5th People's Daily. Thousands of farmers and more than twenty stonemasons in Huaning County, Yunnan, relying on their enthusiasm and hard work, built a steel beam bridge over the turbulent Nanpan River with their own hands. Before this, two groups of engineers had gone to the site to survey, but both groups of engineers were scared away. Who dares to try, who dares not to try, isn't this an obvious fact?
    Today's society is the world of the working people. As long as this knowledge is useful to the people and the socialist cause, writing books, imparting theories, and obtaining qualifications, degrees, and titles are not difficult. Today's university podium is ready for lectures from experts from the masses. They can freely come and go on the land of the motherland to lecture; if the masses "have no basis for learning", then experts from the masses can write books and impart theories, and the people's country will give these works full convenience in terms of paper and printing conditions; the palace of academia also opens the door to local experts, and titles, degrees, and qualifications will soon be obtained. Yesterday he was a local expert, and today he will become a publicly recognized professor, researcher, and scholar.
    From the few words of this hydraulic engineer in Tianjin, we can clearly see that even today, the bourgeois experts are still unwilling to admit defeat, and in the academic circles, they still look down on everyone and regard themselves as "orthodox." However, the masses have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, developed their enthusiasm, and their talents have been revealed. It is time for bourgeois scholars and experts to take a look at their own faces. Your knowledge that does not solve practical problems and your titles and signboards that only have their appearance can no longer scare or deceive people.

    先生，你倒去碰碰看！
    刘丰
    据光明日报报道：天津有一位水利工程师不相信群众用“土办法”能建筑很多水闸。他说：“虽然有建成的，但是，这好似一个人有病，却被一个没有学过医的人治好了，那是碰上的。”
    说群众“没有学过”，这分明说自己是学过的，是有学问的了。但不知道他是不是懂得，即使自然科学的书本知识，也完全是从生产斗争的实践得来，实践乃是书本的源泉。这就是说：他所奉为神明的书本，也仍然是积累了无数群众的创造和经验的。群众没有教授所占有的那些学问，可是也具有教授所没有的学问；他们没有读过什么书本，可是却有自己的专业的知识；他们没有掌握任何文献资料，但却自己进行了调查研究；自然他们也不会受什么规章制度的束缚，完全是大胆地幻想，大胆地实践，大胆地创造，终于解决了问题。
    建筑水闸这当然需要很多的学问，例如力学和关于水和土壤的知识等等。但是这些学问并不出之于自以为是“专家”的头脑，而是来之于实践。因而完全可以自学得来，虽然这是艰苦的，然而却不是不可能。群众眼看到洪水为患，水涝成灾，或者干旱不雨，而一些自封专家的人也束手无策，或者有策也不愿拿出来，要待价而估的时候，他们就自己来想尽办法兴修水利，建筑水闸来调节水量。办法于是找出来。这些办法自然是既适于群众需要又合乎科学原理的。
    然而这都不一定是书本上有的，这是一种“无本之学”。这种学问却比一切书本上的死东西，更适合于当时当地的情况，更能满足当时当地的需要。这种由于形势需要而产生的学问，正是最实际、最有用的学问。在那位水利工程师看来，仿佛只有专门学过的事才能做，只有老师教过的事才能做。他实质上是看不起来自劳动人民的专家，而认为只有出身于学校，取得“水利工程师”称号的专家，才是真正“老王麻子”。老字号是吓不了人的，人民问的是你铺子里到底卖的什么货色？实际的需要是对真假专家的一个最好的考验和甄别，事实上是纵有“水利工程师”称号却对水利无贡献，群众虽没有称号却做出了成绩。输了不肯老老实实认输，还昧着良心诬蔑地说：“那是碰上的”。人们不禁要问一下：先生，请你去碰碰看如何？你是专门学过的，带有称号的工程师，为什么却没有碰上呢？还可以举个最近的例子，就在7月5日的人民日报上。云南华宁县的上千农民和二十多个石匠，凭着干劲和钻劲，用双手在水流湍急的南盘江上建起了一座钢梁大桥。而在这以前，曾有两批工程师到现场去踏勘，但是两批工程师都被吓跑了。谁敢碰，谁不敢碰，这不是明摆着的事实吗？
    今天社会已是劳动人民的天下，只要这学问对人民和社会主义事业有用，著书立说，传授学说，取得资格、学位、称号都不是什么难事。今天的大学讲坛正为来自群众中的专家准备好了讲席，他们可以在祖国的土地上自由来去地讲学；说群众“学无所据”，那么来自群众中的专家就可著书立说，人民的国家在纸张和印刷条件上给予这些著作以充分的便利；学术之宫也对土专家大开方便之门，称号、学位、资格也会很快取得，昨天是个土专家，今天就会成为众所公认的教授、研究员、学者。
    从天津这位水利工程师的寥寥数语中，我们已可清楚地看出，直到今天，资产阶级的专家还不肯认输，在学术界中还是目空一切自视为“正统”。然而群众思想解放了，迷信打破了，钻劲发挥了，自己的才华已经显露出来，资产阶级的学者专家已经到了照一照自己面孔的时候了。你们的不解决实际问题的学问和纵有其表的称号和招牌再也吓不了人，骗不了人。
