    小学满天星斗　中学遍地开花
    吉林省公主岭专区已办中等学校441所
    吉林省公主岭专区到6月10日，已经办起中等学校四百四十一所。为了适应生产的需要，不仅办起农业中学，还办了水利、畜牧、卫生、园艺、拖拉机、电力、工业、水文气象、林业等职业中学。全专区已经做到了乡乡有中学，全专区平均每个乡已有一所半中等学校。用群众的一句话说，全专区已经是“小学满天星斗，中学遍地开花”。在公主岭专区各县中，农安县又是大办农业中学的先进地区，他们发展中学的速度快、质量高。原来，农安县只有七所普通中学，近一个月，全县就办起八十七所中等学校。他们不仅办初中，还办了两所高中，共八个班，有四百零七人在高中学习。现在，农安全县平均每乡有二点二所中学。
