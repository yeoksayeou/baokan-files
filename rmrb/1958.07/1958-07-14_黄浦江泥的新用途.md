Under the inspiration of the General Line, the Silicate Teaching and Research Group of the East China Institute of Chemical Technology has recently experimented with making foamed glass for construction from Huangpu River mud. This foamed glass has sound insulation and heat protection properties, and the cost is very low.

It can be used not only for walls and ceilings, but also for heat protection and sound insulation in high-temperature workshops and broadcasting studios. With this glass, not only can a large amount of wood be saved, but its price is also much cheaper than wood.

    黄浦江泥的新用途
    华东化工学院硅酸盐教研组在总路线的鼓舞下，最近试用黄浦江泥制成建筑用泡沫玻璃。这种泡沫玻璃有隔音、防热作用，成本很低。
    它不仅可做墙壁、天花板，而且可供高温车间、播音室作防热、隔音之用。有了这种玻璃，不但可节约大量木材，而且它的价格也比木材便宜许多。
