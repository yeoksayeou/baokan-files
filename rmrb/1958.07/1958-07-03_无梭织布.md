Shuttleless Weaving

According to the Hebei Daily, shuttleless weaving has become a reality at the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Venture Xu'an Weaving Factory. On the night of June 29th, the workers of this factory installed a shuttleless weaving machine, and its usage is good. This is a new innovation in China's textile industry.

On the shuttle raceway of this loom, instead of a wooden shuttle, two small and exquisite "iron hands" transmit the weft yarn back and forth. Whenever the warp yarns are staggered up and down, one small "iron hand" tightly pinches a weft yarn from one end and passes it to another small "iron hand" in the middle of the raceway. This small "iron hand" then pulls the weft yarn to the other end. Returning, this small "iron hand" transmits the weft yarn back again, handing it over to that small "iron hand." The method of shuttleless weaving can also eliminate the process of making "cops." After the cotton yarn is made into cones, it can be directly used for weaving. With shuttle weaving, the yarn cops on the shuttle have to be changed every three or four minutes; with shuttleless weaving, one cone can be used for continuous production for two days. At the same time, it can also eliminate the deafening sound of the wooden shuttle hitting back and forth.

This shuttleless weaving machine was boldly conceived by Chen Shoupeng, a 21-year-old weaving worker in this factory, and successfully researched with the help of veteran workers Rong Shaohua, Li Zhilan, Sun Fengxiao, and Li Guozhu.

    无梭织布
    据河北日报报道不用梭织布，在天津市公私合营旭安织布厂已经成为事实。6月29日夜间，这个厂的工人安装的一台无梭织布机，使用情况良好。这是我国纺织业中的一项新的创举。
    在这台布机机梭子跑道上，来回传送纬纱的不是木梭，而是两只小巧玲珑的“铁手”，每当经纱上下错开的时候，一只小“铁手”就从一端紧紧捏着一根纬纱在跑道中间传递给另一只小“铁手”，这只小“铁手”就把纬纱拉到另一端。返回来，这只小“铁手”，又把纬纱传送回来，递交那只小“铁手”。采用无梭织布的方法，还可以免除打“穗子”这道工序，棉纱打成筒子以后，就可以直接用来织布。有梭织布，每隔三、四分钟就得换一次梭上的纱穗子：无梭织布，换一次筒子就可以连续生产两天。同时也可以消除木梭来回击打着的震耳声。
    这台无梭织布机是这个厂二十一岁青年织布工人陈寿鹏大胆设想的，在老工人荣绍华、李芝兰、孙凤霄和李国柱等帮助下研究成功的。
