Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 1st: Pu'er County in southern Yunnan is developing local industry oriented towards the countryside, with broad avenues, and has transformed into a thousand-factory county in two months.

Before liberation, Pu'er County was almost a blank slate in terms of industry. By last year, the entire county had only three local industrial factories and mines. Including handicrafts and small factories run by various systems, there were only sixty-four in total. The industrial products needed by the more than 90,000 people of the Hani, Yi, Kucong, Han, and other ethnic groups in the county mostly had to be transported from Kunming and other places over long distances of over a thousand miles.

In April, the Pu'er County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "The whole party mobilizes, the whole people acts, so that every township has a factory, every team has a factory, local industry chases wherever agriculture leaps, achieving a thousand-jin county, a thousand-factory county, so that the output value of local industry catches up with the output value of agriculture in one year." Subsequently, each township formulated plans for the development of local industry and convened meetings to mobilize the masses. As a result, a surging tide of the masses running industry rose up, and many difficulties were readily solved.

From late April to the end of May, one thousand and sixteen new factories and mines were built in the county. Together with the existing factories and mines, there were a total of one thousand and eighty, of which eight hundred and seventy-eight directly served agricultural production. The county also established several backbone factories and mines for iron smelting, copper smelting, power generation, coal mining, agricultural tool manufacturing, and indigenous fertilizer production.

These factories have already begun to have an important impact on the production and lives of the more than 90,000 people of all ethnic groups in the county. This year, the agricultural tool factory has produced 257 kinds of new agricultural tools and implements for farmers of all ethnic groups, strongly supporting the great leap forward in agriculture. The county-run indigenous fertilizer factory and the more than 500 granular fertilizer factories spread throughout the townships and communes had produced more than 300 million jin of fertilizer by the end of May.

    普洱两个月变成千厂县
    据新华社昆明1日电　云南南部普洱县地方工业面向农村，门路广阔，两个月内变成了千厂县。
    普洱县解放前在工业上几乎是一张白纸，到去年，全县也只有三个地方工业厂矿，加上手工业及各系统自办的小工厂，一共也只有六十四个。全县九万多哈尼、彝、苦聪、汉等族人民所需工业品，大都要经过千里以上的长途运输，从昆明及其它地方运来。
    4月份，中共普洱县委提出了“全党动员，全民动手，作到乡乡有厂，队队有厂，农业跃到哪里，地方工业追到哪里，实现千斤县，千厂县，使地方工业产值一年赶上农业产值”的口号。接着，各乡制订了发展地方工业的规划，并且召开会议发动群众，于是群众办工业的浪潮就汹涌而起，许多困难也都迎刃而解。
    从4月下旬到5月底，全县新建成厂矿一千零一十六个，加上原有厂矿共计一千零八十个，其中直接为农业生产服务的有八百七十八个。县里也办起了炼铁、冶铜、发电、采煤、农具制造、土化肥等几个骨干厂矿。
    这些工厂已开始对全县九万多各族人民的生产和生活发生重要的影响。农具厂今年已为各族农民生产二百五十七种新农具和工具，有力地支援了农业大跃进。县办的土化肥厂和遍布各乡、社的五百多个颗粒肥料厂，到5月底已生产出肥料三亿多斤。
