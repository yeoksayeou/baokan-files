    Letters to the Editor

    In Comrade Yuan Mu's article "They are Ordinary Laborers," published on the fourth page of your newspaper on June 25th, the two lines of poetry about me, "The construction site widely praises old Huang Zhong... countless heroes point and direct," at the end of the last paragraph, were not written by me. Please correct this.
                                                Chen Weiji

    6月25日你报第四版所载袁木同志写的“他们是普通劳动者”文章中，关于我写的一首诗是“工地争传老黄忠……无数英雄指顾中”。最后一段的两句诗，不是我写的，请予更正。
