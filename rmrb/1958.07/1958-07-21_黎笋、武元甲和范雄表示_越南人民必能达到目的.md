Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th: The Hanoi-based "Thong Nhat" (Unification) Weekly published on July 19th the remarks made by Le Duan, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Pham Hung, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, to its reporters on July 18th regarding the issue of achieving Vietnamese reunification.

Le Duan stated: "The anti-American movement is developing everywhere. This situation makes the Vietnamese people, especially the people of South Vietnam, more confident in their fighting strength and believe that we will surely defeat US imperialism and its accomplices. I believe that the people of South Vietnam will launch a high tide of the anti-American movement on the broadest front, including all strata of people."

Vo Nguyen Giap, on the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the prospects for peace and unification of Vietnam, said that the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities are continuing to blatantly violate the Geneva Accords. They refuse to hold consultations with the Vietnamese government to discuss the issue of national unification. Their conspiracy is to divide Vietnamese territory and undermine the peace and unification of Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the peace and unification of Vietnam are mainly determined by the strength of the Vietnamese people. The force of solidarity and struggle of the entire Vietnamese people from north to south is the most powerful guarantee for the peace of Vietnam and the decisive factor for the victory of the struggle to unify Vietnam.

Pham Hung, referring to the question of how the issue of Vietnamese unification will be resolved if the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities remain obdurate, said, "If the southern regime continues to go against the wishes of the people and refuses to abandon its path of subservience to the United States, they will certainly not escape the tragic fate suffered by those puppet regimes in Vietnam's past and in the world today. The example of the Iraqi people rising up to overthrow the reactionary government of the US-British lackeys gives our people more confidence in the power and possibility of political struggle for national unification. At the same time, this is a serious warning to all puppet regimes that are willing to be US lackeys and violate the interests of the people."

    黎笋、武元甲和范雄表示
    越南人民必能达到目的
    据新华社河内19日电  19日河内出版的“统一”周刊发表了越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋、武元甲和范雄18日分别就有关实现越南统一问题向它的记者发表的谈话。
    黎笋说：反美运动正在到处发展着。这种形势使越南人民特别是越南南方人民更加相信自己的战斗力量，相信我们一定会战胜美帝国主义和它的帮凶。我相信越南南方人民将会在一个包括各阶层人民最广泛的战线上掀起一个反美运动的高潮。
    武元甲就日内瓦协议的执行情况和越南和平和统一的前途等问题发表谈话说，目前美国和南越当局继续明目张胆地违反日内瓦协议。他们拒绝同越南政府举行协商，讨论统一国家的问题。他们的阴谋是要分裂越南的领土和破坏越南的和平和统一。
    武元甲说，越南的和平和统一主要是由越南人民的力量来决定的。越南由北到南的全体人民团结斗争的力量是越南和平最有力的保障，是使统一越南的斗争取得胜利的决定因素。
    范雄谈到如果美国和吴庭艳当局顽固不化，越南统一的问题将怎样解决的问题，他说，如果南方政权仍旧继续违背全国人民的愿望，不肯放弃他们附属于美国的道路，他们一定不能逃出像越南过去和目前世界上那些傀儡政权遭到的悲惨失败的命运。伊拉克人民起来推翻美英走狗的反动政府的例子使我们人民对统一国家的政治斗争的力量和可能性更加有了信心。同时，这也是对甘心作美国走狗、违背人民利益的所有傀儡政权的一个严重的警告。
