Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 19th. President Nasser of the United Arab Republic addressed a crowd of over 60,000 people in Liberation Square here on the evening of the 18th, saying, "From here, on behalf of you, I announce that we will take up arms to defend the torch of freedom that has been victorious in Iraq. We will all take up arms to defend the independence and victory we have achieved, and to defend Arab nationalism."

President Nasser warmly praised the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people for freedom. He said, "I say to you, our brothers in Baghdad, we stand completely by your side, and we are willing to shed every drop of blood for you." He said that the Iraqi people had stood up and faced murder, prisons, and persecution, but had never lost hope. He pointed out that the people of the United Arab Republic are with their brothers in Iraq because "we are one people, one nation."

Nasser also said that brothers in Amman and Beirut are fighting for their freedom and independence, and the banner of freedom will rise in Amman and Beirut, just as it rises everywhere in the Arab world.

President Nasser called on the people to prepare for the worst and announced that they would fight to the end. He said, "Threats and fleets will never intimidate us, and atomic bombs will never intimidate us, because fleets and atomic bombs will disappear and turn to ashes in the face of Arab nationalism."

President Nasser said that if the threats we see today come from the imperialist countries of the United States, which is occupying Lebanon, and Britain, which is occupying Jordan, I want to say to them on behalf of you that France once occupied Damascus, and Britain once occupied Baghdad, Cairo, and Amman. But where are the occupiers now? Their occupation is over, turned to ashes, and the torch of freedom has triumphed.

Nasser then said, "I want to say to these occupiers that we are still determined to carry out what we have said: we adopt a peaceful attitude towards those who treat us peacefully, and we oppose those who oppose us. If they want peace, we are in favor; if they oppose us, we will fight to the last drop of blood. This is our path and our motto."

He said that the Iraqi Republican government has agreed to maintain oil supplies without any interference, and to respect the UN Charter and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference. He pointed out that in this case, why are the imperialists and Western leaders afraid? He said that this is because they were still plotting yesterday to use Iraq to oppose the independence of the United Arab Republic and to oppose Arab nationalism. But today Iraq is free and has joined the ranks of progressive Arab countries.

Nasser said that the United States notified us yesterday that the United Arab Republic should be responsible for the safety of American troops in Lebanon. I don't understand why they entered Lebanon and occupied it, and then asked us to be responsible for protecting this occupation. Nasser also refuted the claim that the landing of American and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan was due to so-called interference by the United Arab Republic. He said: "People always oppose occupation and eventually achieve victory. The people of Asia, Africa, and the United States itself have opposed occupation. The United States fought against Britain, won victory, and achieved independence. It is only natural that the Arab people will also oppose occupation anywhere." He said that the Arab people are fighting for their independence everywhere and will go from victory to victory, just as the people of the United Arab Republic won victory in Port Said in 1956.

Nasser said that today we feel that the banner of freedom, which has defeated occupation, tyranny, oppression, and imperialist aggression, is being raised higher and higher. "Each of you and every member of the Arab nation is determined to make his country free, to make him the master of his country, and is willing to shed blood and sacrifice for independence."

Nasser said, "Arab nationalism, which has broken the chains that bind it, is not represented by one person, a few people, nor is it represented by Gamal Abdel Nasser and anyone else, but by you, by all of you."

Nasser's speech was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and shouts of slogans from the crowd. The crowd shouted slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "American troops get out of Lebanon immediately," and "British troops get out of Jordan immediately."

    纳赛尔号召阿拉伯人民
    拿起武器保卫独立自由
    舰队和原子弹都吓不倒争自由的人民
    新华社大马士革19日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔18日晚上在这里的撤兵广场对六万多群众说：“我从这里代表你们宣布，我们将拿起武器来保卫在伊拉克取得胜利的自由火炬。我们全体将都拿起武器来保卫我们所取得的独立和胜利，保卫阿拉伯民族主义。”
    纳赛尔总统热烈赞扬伊拉克人民所进行的争取自由的英勇斗争。他说：“我向你们在巴格达的弟兄们说，我们完全站在你们一边，我们愿为你们流尽每一滴血。”他说，伊拉克人民曾经站起来并且面临着谋杀、监狱和迫害，但是从来没有失去希望。他指出，阿拉伯联合共和国的人民是同在伊拉克的兄弟在一起的，因为“我们是一个人民，一个民族。”
    纳赛尔又说，在安曼和贝鲁特的弟兄们正在为争取他们的自由和独立而斗争，自由的旗帜将在安曼和贝鲁特升起来，就像它在阿拉伯世界的每个地方升起来一样。
    纳赛尔总统号召人民准备应付最坏的情况，并且宣布将坚持战斗到底。他说，“威胁和舰队决吓不倒我们，原子弹也决吓不倒我们，因为舰队和原子弹将在阿拉伯民族主义面前消失和化为灰烬。”
    纳赛尔总统说，如果我们今天所看到的威胁是来自占领黎巴嫩的美国和占领约旦的英国这些帝国主义国家，我要代表你们向它们说，法国曾经占领过大马士革，英国曾经占领过巴格达、开罗和安曼。但是现在占领者在那里呢？他们的占领已经完蛋，化为灰烬，自由的火炬胜利了。
    纳赛尔然后说：“我要对这些占领者说，我们仍然决心执行我们所说过的话：我们对那些以和平态度对待我们的人采取和平态度，我们敌视那些敌视我们的人。如果他们愿意和平，我们赞成，如果他们敌视我们，我们将战斗到最后一滴血。这就是我们的道路和我们的格言。”
    他说，伊拉克共和国政府已经同意在不受任何干涉的情况下保持石油供应，尊重联合国宪章和万隆会议的决议。他指出，在这种情况下，帝国主义和西方领导人为什么害怕？他说，这是因为他们昨天还在策划利用伊拉克来反对阿拉伯联合共和国的独立，反对阿拉伯民族主义。而今天伊拉克却自由了，加入了前进的阿拉伯国家的队伍。
    纳赛尔说，美国昨天通知我们，阿拉伯联合共和国应当对黎巴嫩的美军的安全负责。我不了解为什么他们进入黎巴嫩，并且占领它，然后却要我们来负责保护这种占领。纳赛尔还驳斥了美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦登陆是由于所谓阿拉伯联合共和国进行干涉的说法。他说：“人民总是反对占领并且终于取得胜利的。亚洲、非洲以及美国本国的人民都曾经反对过占领。美国曾经同英国进行斗争，得到胜利，并且取得了独立。很当然，阿拉伯人民也将反对任何地方的占领。”他说，阿拉伯人民正在各地为争取自己的独立而斗争，并且将像阿拉伯联合共和国人民1956年在塞得港获得胜利一样，从胜利走向胜利。
    纳赛尔说，今天我们感觉到，曾经击败占领、暴政、压迫和帝国主义侵略的自由旗帜，已经举得越来越高了。“你们每个人和阿拉伯民族的每一个人，坚决要使他的国家是自由的，要使他是他的国家的主人并且愿意为独立而流血牺牲。”
    纳赛尔说，“打破了束缚自己的锁链的阿拉伯民族主义并不是由一个人、一些人所代表的，也不是由加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔和任何其他人所代表的，而是由你们，由你们大家所代表的。”
    纳赛尔的演说不断为热烈的掌声和群众高呼的口号声所打断。群众高呼：“打倒帝国主义”、“美军立即从黎巴嫩滚出去”，“英军立即从约旦滚出去”等口号。
