Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 6th: At the invitation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Dong Biwu, head of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, and delegation member An Ziwen, left Prague by special plane on the afternoon of the 6th to travel to the German Democratic Republic. Before leaving Czechoslovakia, Comrade Dong Biwu answered questions posed to him by a reporter from "Red Right Newspaper."

When discussing his impressions of the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Dong Biwu said that the congress was a victorious and united one. It established a series of correct tasks in the political, economic, and ideological fields for the completion of Czechoslovakia's socialist construction, powerfully demonstrating the rock-solid unity of the entire Czechoslovak Communist Party and the party with all the people, and fully embodying the determination and heroic spirit of the people of the whole country to complete socialist construction. The Congress resolutely condemned the betrayers of Marxism-Leninism—the Yugoslav revisionists—once again demonstrating the Czechoslovak Communist Party's consistent adherence to the principles of proletarian internationalism.

Dong Biwu then said that during his visits to various parts of Czechoslovakia, he personally witnessed the Czechoslovak people struggling with soaring labor enthusiasm to realize the glorious tasks put forward by the Eleventh Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and was deeply moved by the sincere and profound friendship of the Czechoslovak people towards the Chinese people.

Dong Biwu pointed out that the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism closely link the Czechoslovak people, guarding the western outpost of the socialist camp, with the Chinese people, who are on the eastern front. Both our peoples regard consolidating the socialist camp and the unity of the international communist movement, as well as thoroughly smashing modern revisionism as concentratedly expressed in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as our sacred international duty. Six hundred million Chinese people will forever advance bravely together with the fraternal Czechoslovak people for the victory of communism throughout the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 6th: The Chinese Communist Party delegation, headed by Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, arrived in Berlin by special plane this afternoon from Prague. The delegation is invited to attend the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, scheduled to open on the 10th.

Members of the delegation include An Ziwen, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Guoquan, Chinese Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic.

Among those who greeted the delegation at the airport were Stoph, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Honecker and Mückenberger, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the Central Committee, Hager and Grünenberg, secretaries of the Central Committee, Apel, chairman of the Economic Commission of the Central Political Bureau, Schuen, Minister of Cadres of the Central Committee, Kelson, Deputy Minister of the Liaison Department, Schwab, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Kiefert, First Secretary of the Greater Berlin Municipal Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, and more than 500 Berlin citizens.

    中共代表团应邀参加德国统一社会党五大已到达柏林
    据新华社布拉格6日电  应邀参加捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会的中国共产党代表团团长董必武和团员安子文，6日下午乘专机离开布拉格前往德意志民主共和国。在离开捷克斯洛伐克之前，董必武同志回答了“红色权利报”记者向他提出的问题。
    董必武在谈到对捷共第十一次代表大会的印象时说，这次大会是一个胜利的团结的大会。它为完成捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设制定了一系列政治、经济和思想工作方面的正确的任务，有力地表明了捷共全党以及党和全体人民坚如磐石的团结，充分体现了全国人民完成社会主义建设的决心和豪迈精神。代表大会坚决谴责了马克思列宁主义的叛徒——南斯拉夫修正主义者，再一次表明捷共一贯忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则。
    董必武接着谈到，他在捷克斯洛伐克各地访问时，亲眼看到捷克斯洛伐克人民正以高涨的劳动热情为实现捷共第十一次代表大会提出的光荣任务而斗争，也为捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民的诚挚深厚的友情而深深感动。
    董必武指出，战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义把守卫在社会主义阵营西方前哨的捷克斯洛伐克人民同处于东方前线的中国人民紧紧地联结在一起，我们两国人民都把巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结以及彻底粉碎以南共纲领为集中表现的现代修正主义作为自己神圣的国际义务。六亿中国人民将永远同兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民一起为全世界共产主义的胜利而奋勇前进。
