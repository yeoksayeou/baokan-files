Implementing the Policy of Combining Education with Productive Labor
Wuhan University Establishes Over One Hundred Factories and Farms

(Our dispatch) Wuhan University, in order to implement the policy of combining teaching with productive labor, has launched a mass movement to establish factories and farms on a large scale.

To date, more than twenty factories and farms have either started construction or are in preparation, including two large-scale comprehensive farms. The remaining factories will be built successively within the year. Most of these factories are built using equipment from the laboratories, while another part is built by students through voluntary labor.

Among the factories that have started or are about to start operation are steel, cement, refractory materials, and advanced chemical synthesis factories. There are also semiconductor factories, electronic computer factories, and precision instrument machinery factories established to develop China's cutting-edge science; as well as brick factories, paper mills, and woodworking factories with simpler technology. The engineering and technical personnel of these factories are all teachers from related majors and some outstanding senior students, and the technical workers are all students.

A joint iron and steel plant with an annual output of 15,000 tons of steel (5,000 tons of steel, 10,000 tons of iron), which is being built by the Metal Physics Teaching and Research Group of the Physics Department, is striving to produce iron by "August 1st." This joint factory will include a steelmaking plant, an ironmaking plant, a coking plant, a gas plant, a cement plant, a chemical plant, etc. The waste gas produced by the steel plant will also be used to manufacture distilled water and build greenhouses for the farm. In this way, all by-products, slag, and waste gas of the steel plant will be utilized. This steel plant mainly refines special steel, and the Metal Physics Teaching and Research Group will use it as a base for carrying out scientific research and teaching activities, as well as a place for students to experiment and practice. The metal factory and radio factory of the Physics Department, which have already started operation, will be expanded into precision instrument machinery factories and electronic instrument factories. These two factories will provide precision instruments with international standards for the department's new laboratories. Through the manufacturing of these instruments, teachers and students will greatly improve their scientific and technological knowledge and production knowledge that cannot be learned from books. These two factories will trial-produce precision instruments such as televisions, electronic computers, pulse oscilloscopes, and microwave detectors this year. The metal factory is also cooperating with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to manufacture China's first ionospheric automatic observation instrument before September this year. This instrument can automatically observe, record, and photograph. This instrument is planned to be mass-produced in the future. The teachers and students of the Chemistry Department decided to establish ten factories according to specialization. These factories mainly research and trial-produce new products that cannot be manufactured domestically or internationally for the production sector; analyze and identify the elemental composition of new products from factories and mines; and comprehensively utilize by-products, waste materials, and waste gas from various factories and farms on campus. The organic chemical factory, which has already started operation, has accepted the trial production task of more than 100 chemical reagents that cannot be manufactured domestically from a factory in Beijing, and some of the products have been successfully trial-produced. The students of the Physics and Chemistry Departments spent only three days and three nights to build a radio factory and a physical chemistry factory, and manufactured eight-tube radios, amplifiers, audio oscillators, and 84 pairs of thermocouples with international standards and other products.

After a major debate on teaching reform, the Biology Department decided to establish a large-scale comprehensive farm in the entire department, divided into cotton and grain crop farms, botanical gardens, orchards, livestock farms, and fish farms according to the students' majors. In the future, most of the courses in the department will adopt the method of combining classes with labor, so that teaching and productive labor are closely integrated. This farm will also summarize and study the experience of high-yield crops in the Central and Southern regions, cultivate excellent varieties of high-yielding animals and plants, and carry out research on Michurin's theory. The main product high-yield targets of the farm in 1959 are: 10,000 catties per mu for single-season rice, 15,000 catties per mu for double-season rice, 6,000 catties per mu for wheat, 4,000 catties per mu for seed cotton, 8,000 catties per mu for tomatoes, and 10,000 catties per mu for fish.

The revolutionary enthusiasm of the young teachers and students powerfully shattered the fallacies of those with bourgeois educational ideas who said that comprehensive universities cannot run factories and that teaching and scientific research are not easy to connect with production practice.

    贯彻教育与劳动生产相结合的方针
    武汉大学兴办工厂农场一百多个
    本报讯　武汉大学为贯彻教学与劳动生产相结合的方针，掀起了一个群众性的大办工厂、农场运动。
    到目前为止，已经开工或正在筹建的达二十多个，其中有两个大型综合农场，其余工厂将在年内陆续建成。这些工厂大都是利用试验室的设备建成，另一部分是由学生的义务劳动建设起来的。
    在已经开工和即将开工的工厂中，有钢铁、水泥、耐火材料、高级化学合成工厂等；也有为发展我国尖端科学而兴办的半导体工厂、电子计算机厂、精密仪器机械厂等；还有技术较简单的砖瓦厂、造纸厂、木工厂等。这些工厂的工程技术人员全部由有关专业的教师和部分优秀的高年级学生担任，技术工人全部是学生。
    由物理系金属物理教研组负责建设的一座年产钢铁一万五千吨（钢五千吨，铁一万吨）的钢铁联合工厂争取在“八一”出铁。这个联合工厂将包括有炼钢厂、炼铁厂、炼焦厂、煤气厂、水泥厂、化工厂等，钢铁厂所产生的废气还准备用来制造蒸馏水和建设农场的温室。这样，这个钢铁厂的全部副产品、废渣、废气都被利用起来。这座钢铁厂主要是炼特种钢，金属物理教研组将把它作为开展科学研究和教学活动的据点和学生实验、实习的场所。已经开工的物理系金工厂和无线电工厂将要扩建成精密仪器机械厂和电子仪器厂。这两个工厂将要为该系新增的试验室提供具有国际水平的精密仪器。教师学生通过对这些仪器的制造，将大大提高科学技术知识和在书本上无法学到的生产知识。这两个厂要在今年试制出电视机、电子计算机、脉冲示波器、微波探测器等精密仪器。金工厂还和中国科学院合作，要在今年9月以前制造出我国第一台电离层自动观察仪，这种仪器能自动观察、记录、摄影。这种仪器，今后准备大批生产。化学系师生决定按专门化建立十个工厂，这些工厂主要是为生产部门研究、试制国内、国际上不能制造的新产品；分析鉴定厂矿企业新产品的原素成分，综合利用校内各工厂、农场的副产品和废料、废气。已开工的有机化工厂，接受了北京某厂一百多项国内不能制造的化学试剂的试制任务，其中一部分产品已试制成功。物理和化学系的学生只用三天三夜的时间就建成了一个无线电工厂和一个物理化学工厂，并制造出来了八灯收音机、扩音器、音频振动器和达到国际水平的84对热电堆等产品。
    生物系经过教学改革大辩论后，决定在全系兴办一个大型综合农场，按学生所学的专业分成棉粮作物农场、植物园、果树园、畜牧场、渔场等部门。今后该系的大部分课程将采取边上课、边劳动的办法，使教学和劳动生产密切结合。这个农场，今后还要总结、研究中南地区各种农作物丰产经验，培育各种高额丰产的动物、植物的优良品种以及展开米丘林学说的研究等。农场在1959年的主要产品的丰产指标是：单季稻亩产一万斤，双季稻亩产一万五千斤，小麦亩产六千斤，籽棉亩产四千斤，蕃茄亩产八千斤，鱼亩产一万斤。
    青年师生的这些革命干劲有力地粉碎了那些有资产阶级教育思想的人所说的综合大学不能办工厂、教学和科学研究不容易联系生产实际等的论调。（陆永良）（附图片）
