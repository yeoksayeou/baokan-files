    The First Furnace of Young Pioneer Steel

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 11th: China's first furnace of Young Pioneer steel was produced on July 6th by the Red Scarf Iron and Steel Metallurgy Factory of Guangdong Guangya Middle School. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Education has decided to award a banner and a bonus of 100 yuan to reward these Young Pioneers who dare to act and love labor.

    This Red Scarf Iron and Steel Metallurgy Factory was established by dozens of Young Pioneers who stayed at school to review their lessons and were too weak to go to the countryside to help farmers with the summer harvest. It took them only a little over three days from preparing to build the factory to smelting steel. From the factory director and chief engineer to the workers, all positions were held by Young Pioneers. They went separately to some factories and schools that had successfully used indigenous methods to learn techniques, and borrowed materials and tools from some large factories and universities. They designed and built the steelmaking furnace themselves. Under the guidance of the counselor, the small factory director, and the chief engineer, they finally produced the first furnace of medium carbon steel.

    第一炉少先钢
    据新华社广州11日电　我国第一炉少先钢7月6日由广东广雅中学红领巾钢铁冶金工厂制成。广东省教育厅决定颁发一面奖旗和一百元奖金，奖励这些敢作敢为、热爱劳动的少先队员。
    这个红领巾钢铁冶金工厂，是留校温习功课和因体弱而没有到农村去帮助农民夏收的几十名少先队员建立的。他们从筹备建厂到炼出钢来，只花了三天多时间，厂内从厂长、总工程师到工人都由少先队员担任。他们曾分头到一些采用土法炼钢成功的工厂、学校去学习技术，并到一些大工厂、高等学校借材料和用具，自己动手设计和建造了炼钢炉。在辅导员、小工厂厂长、总工程师的指挥下，终于炼出了第一炉中炭钢。
