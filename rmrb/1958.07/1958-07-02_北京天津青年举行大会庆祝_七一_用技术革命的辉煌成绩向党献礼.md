Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: More than 40,000 youths from the capital gathered in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City last night to hold a celebration rally to commemorate "July 1st" and present gifts to the Party, the Motherland, and the People.

The Soviet Youth Advanced Producers and Scientific and Technological Workers Delegation was also invited to attend the meeting.

Last night, the ancient halls of the Forbidden City radiated youthful brilliance. Youths from all fronts in the capital, holding high red flags and beating gongs and drums, came here to present gifts to the Party. A gift-presenting army composed of more than 2,000 youth representatives from various factories, mines, enterprises, construction, agriculture, and universities brought with them some of the tens of thousands of creations, inventions, and technological innovations of the capital's youth in the form of physical objects and models. These included newly-made tractors, small jeeps, semiconductor electronic tubes, and models and charts of various automated, mechanized, and semi-mechanized machines that changed backward manual operations, fully demonstrating the amazing achievements made by the youth in the technological revolution under the encouragement of the general line for socialist construction, displaying a communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act.

The brand-new "Youth" universal tractor in the gift-presenting procession was manufactured by the youth of the state-owned Yongding Machinery Factory through eleven days and nights of hard work. This tractor can perform deep plowing, weeding, land reclamation, flour milling, water pumping, and power generation.

In this gift presentation, 300 kinds of products and technological inventions have reached advanced levels, and some have caught up with or surpassed international levels. The new type of turnout researched and developed by the young track maintenance workers of the Fengtai Engineering Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau is the first of its kind in the world. A group of 22 people from the Beijing Chemical Plant, including 20 young people, have successfully trial-produced 126 new products, many of which have not been produced by even the world's most famous chemical plants.

Young farmers brought good news of bumper harvests of wheat and vegetables from the outskirts of Beijing. The youth planting group of the East Suburb Livestock Farm achieved a yield of 1,113 jin per mu for 37 mu of barley and 1,166 jin per mu for 20 mu of wheat.

Many of the new products brought by university students have reached international levels. Tsinghua University students alone have created 33 items.

Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the direction for young people to move forward is to put politics in command and be both red and expert. He said that many people with bourgeois ideas say that "being red and expert cannot be both." Some people look down on Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, saying that Party members and League members are "vanguards in politics and cheerleaders in business." Such people actually want to take the road of white experts. He said that the facts have refuted this erroneous argument. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members with a high degree of political awareness are vanguards in political revolution, ideological revolution, and economic revolution, and they must also be vanguards in the technological revolution. He encouraged everyone to resolutely advance in the direction of being both red and expert.

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that for the sake of our beloved motherland, the youth of the capital have done well, and the reason they have done well is because they dare to think and dare to act; because they have the leadership of the Party; because they are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people; and because they are not arrogant or complacent and study with an open mind.

Peng Zhen, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, encouraged the youth of Beijing to go all out in future socialist construction and in all revolutionary struggles, and to continue to make greater achievements. He urged them to serve the 600 million people wholeheartedly, to serve socialism, to strive for the realization of communism, to firmly stand on the proletarian stand, and to become communist youth.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 1st: On the morning of July 1st, 30,000 young people in Tianjin, holding high red flags, beating gongs and drums, and carrying various charts, pictures, models, and new products marking the achievements of technological innovation, gathered at the Minyuan Stadium to hold a oath-taking rally to the Party.

Zhang Yu, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, reported to the Party at the meeting on behalf of the city's 180,000 young workers on the brilliant achievements on the production front. From June 1st to 28th, the city's youth put forward a total of more than 1.37 million innovation proposals, of which more than 340,000 have been implemented, including 375 that have caught up with or exceeded international levels, and 734 that have caught up with or exceeded domestic advanced levels. Chen Heng, a young technician at the Tianjin Dyestuff Factory, and the staff of the laboratory, successfully trial-produced 35 kinds of reactive dyes, new vulcanized dyes, and fluorescent whitening agents, making Tianjin's production of reactive dyes surpass that of Britain. Liang Shukai, a young technician at the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory, successfully researched and developed a method of dyeing silk without dyes, overturning the conclusions of some experts, and causing a "chain reaction" among young people in the printing and dyeing industry. Currently, many creations have emerged, such as dyeing cotton, wool, nylon, leather, and rubber without dyes. Wang Quanzhong, a young employee of the Tianjin Water Company, created a radio wave pipe locator before the "May Fourth" Youth Day this year, and recently developed a radio wave leak detector that can detect whether underground water pipes are leaking. Compared with similar products produced by the United States in December last year, the detection depth is three times higher and the volume of the variable wave sound is twice as loud.

These achievements of the youth were achieved under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, clarifying the direction, and through painstaking research. Under the guidance of the leadership, Wang Hanying, a young worker at the Yongming Paint Factory, collected all the paints and dyes in the world, then selected the best American products as opponents, and after more than 280 experiments, finally made the quality of "iron blue" and "chrome green" paints and dyes surpass that of the United States. Li Xi, a young worker at the Feilong Rubber Factory, cut off the inferiority complex of "little Feilong can't catch up with American goods," and after more than 5,000 experiments, made the quality of more than 1,000 kinds of rubber reach international levels, of which the quality of water seal rubber surpassed similar products in the United States.

Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Gu Yunting, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Chao, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, congratulated the youth of the city at the meeting.

At the meeting, 1,023 young people and 330 advanced units were commended. The youth also held a parade at the end.

    北京天津青年举行大会庆祝“七一”
    用技术革命的辉煌成绩向党献礼
    据新华社1日讯　首都四万多名青年昨晚齐集在故宫内的太和殿前举行庆祝“七一”向党向祖国向人民献礼大会。
    苏联青年先进生产者和科学技术工作者代表团也应邀参加大会。
    故宫古老的殿宇前昨晚放射着青春的光彩，首都各战线上的青年高举红旗，敲锣打鼓来到这里向党献礼。由各厂矿企业、建筑、农业和高等学校的二千多名青年代表组成的一支献礼大军，带来了首都青年成万件创造发明和技术革新中的一部分实物、模型。其中有新制成的拖拉机、小吉普车、半导体电子管等产品，以及改变落后的手工操作的各种自动化、机械化、半机械化的机器的模型和图表，充分显示出青年们在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，发挥敢想敢做的共产主义风格，大闹技术革命所获得的惊人成绩。
    献礼队伍里崭新的“青年号”万能拖拉机，是国营永定机械厂的青年苦战十一昼夜制造成功的。这部拖拉机能深耕、除草、开荒、磨面、打水、发电等。
    这次献礼中，有三百种产品和技术发明已达到先进的水平，有的赶上或超过了国际水平。北京铁路管理局丰台工务段青年养路工研究成功的新型道岔，在世界上还是首创。北京化工厂的二十二人组成一个小组，其中有二十人是青年，他们已试制成功了一百二十六种新产品，其中有许多产品是一向被称为世界上有名的化工厂所没有生产出来的。
    青年农民带来了京郊小麦、蔬菜丰收的喜报。东郊畜牧场青年种植小组的三十七亩大麦亩产一千一百一十三斤，二十亩小麦亩产一千一百六十六斤。
    高等学校的学生们带来的新产品中有许多已达国际水平，只清华大学的学生们创造的就有三十三件。
    中共北京市委书记处书记郑天翔在会上讲了话，他指出，青年人前进的方向是政治挂帅，又红又专。他说，不少有资产阶级思想的人说“红专不能两全”；有些人看不起共产党员和共青团员，说党员和团员“政治上是先锋队，业务上是拉拉队”。这种人实际上是要走白色专家的道路。他说，事实已经驳倒了这种错误论调。具有高度政治觉悟的共产党员和共青团员在政治革命、思想革命、经济革命中是先锋队，在技术革命中也必定是先锋队。他勉励大家必须坚决地按着又红又专的方向前进。
    共青团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦讲话说，为了我们亲爱的祖国，首都青年们干得好，所以干得好，是因为敢想、敢干；是因为有党的领导；因为忠于祖国、忠于人民；不骄不傲，虚心学习。
    中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记彭真在会上勉励北京青年在今后社会主义建设中，在各个革命斗争中，鼓足干劲，继续作出更大的成绩。要全心全意为六亿人民服务，为社会主义服务，为共产主义的实现而奋斗，坚定地站稳无产阶级立场，成为共产主义青年。
    据新华社天津1日电　7月1日清晨，天津市三万名青年高举红旗，敲着锣鼓带着各种标志着技术革新成果的图表、画片、模型和新产品，集中在民园体育场举行向党宣誓大会。
    共青团天津市委书记张玉在大会上代表全市十八万青年职工向党汇报了生产战线上的辉煌成果。从6月1日到28日，全市青年提出的革新建议共一百三十七万多件，已经实行了三十四万多件，其中赶上和超过国际水平的有三百七十五件，赶上和超过国内先进水平的有七百三十四件。天津染料厂的青年技术员陈亨和化验所的职工一起，试制成功了三十五种活性染料、新型硫化染料和萤光增白剂，使天津市活性染料的生产超过英国。天津织染厂青年技术员梁树楷研究成功不用染料染丝绸以后，推翻了某些专家的定论，并在印染业青年中引起了“连锁反应”，目前已经出现了不用染料染棉毛、尼龙、皮革、橡胶等许多创造。天津市自来水公司青年职员王权中曾在今年“五四”青年节前创造了电波寻管器，最近又研究成功能测知地下水管是否漏水的电波测漏器，和美国去年12月出产的同样产品比较，测探的深度高三倍，变波声音大一倍。
    青年们的这些成就，都是在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，明确方向，经过苦心钻研取得的。永明油漆厂青年职工王含英在领导的帮助下，收集了世界上所有的油漆染料，然后选定最好的美国产品为对手，经过二百八十多次的试验，终于使“铁蓝”、“铬绿”两种油漆染料的质量超过了美国。飞龙橡胶厂青年职工李玺砍掉了“小小飞龙赶不上美国货”的自卑思想以后，经过五千多次的试验，使一千多种橡胶的质量达到国际水平，其中水封橡胶的质量超过了美国同类产品。
    中共河北省委书记处书记刘子厚，中共天津市委书记处书记谷云亭，共青团中央常委张超等在会上向全市青年致贺。
    会上有一千零二十三名青年和三百三十个先进单位受到了表扬。青年们最后还举行了游行。
