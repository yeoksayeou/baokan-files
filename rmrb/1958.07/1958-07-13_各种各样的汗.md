Various Kinds of Sweat
　　Xie Yu

　　Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, day and night, people are always sweating. However, they sweat more in hot weather, and they are aware of it; at other times, they sweat less, and they are not aware of it. A person's daily sweat volume, if it is not hot and they are not laboring, is 500 milliliters, enough to fill two rice bowls. If it is hot weather, it will be twice as much; if it is in a high-temperature workshop or doing heavy work, they will sweat ten to seventeen times more than usual in eight hours.

　　Sweat can take away heat from the body. We all have this experience: in summer, when water is splashed on the ground, the ground and the surrounding air become cooler. This is because the water evaporates when it encounters heat on the ground. The heat from the ground is used up by the evaporation of water, and the temperature decreases. The principle of sweating to dissipate heat is the same. An adult can lower their body temperature by twelve degrees (Celsius, same below) for every two pounds of sweat they produce.

　　Sweat comes from sweat glands. These are slender tubes invisible to the naked eye, with one end opening on the skin surface and the other end coiled up and buried in the bottom layer of the skin. There are two to three million of these tubes all over the body, but their distribution is uneven. The forehead, palms, soles of the feet, and armpits have the most, with nearly 300 sweat glands in every half-inch square area. If there are no sweat glands or if the sweat glands have problems, heat cannot be dissipated in summer, which will lead to increased water intake and frequent urination, and even fever. Children under two years old are most likely to get this disease, which is medically called "infantile summer fever."

　　Sweat glands are controlled by nerves. As long as the skin temperature increases by five degrees, or the temperature in the blood rises by half a degree, this stimulus is transmitted to the "heat regulation" part of our brain. Then it immediately issues an order for the sweat glands to act - to sweat and dissipate heat. This kind of sweating occurs all over the body. The forehead, neck, arms, and backs of the hands sweat more. People also sweat profusely when they are nervous, afraid, or in severe pain. This is the result of vigorous activity in this part of the nerve system. This kind of sweating rarely occurs all over the body; it mostly occurs in the palms, soles of the feet, and armpits.

　　Sweat tastes salty, with 99% being water and the rest being salt and some other things. If a person is always sweating profusely, the water in their body will be insufficient, and there will be a deficiency of salt. If it is not supplemented in time, the person will become ill: nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, thirst, less urine, fever, and in severe cases, coma and death. Therefore, it is necessary to drink more water and eat more salty foods in hot weather.

　　Some people sweat profusely for no reason. As soon as they move, they are drenched as if by rain. This is called hyperhidrosis, which mostly occurs in people who are prone to nervousness, are physically weak, or are obese. People with diseases such as "hyperthyroidism" also sweat profusely all day long. Some people's palms and soles sweat particularly easily, probably because the nerves' regulation of the sweat glands in these areas is somewhat abnormal.

　　Excessive sweating is not beneficial to the skin. Sweat softens the skin, making it easy for bacteria to enter, so sweaty skin is prone to boils. Moreover, wet skin cannot withstand friction, so it is also prone to skin rashes. Some bacteria like to grow in sweat and turn it into smelly water. Some people's feet are very smelly, or their whole body has a sour odor, which is the "achievement" of these bacteria. Therefore, you should bathe often in summer.

　　Some people sweat coldly, which is characterized by the skin feeling cool and sweat beads constantly appearing. This is mostly a symptom of collapse in people suffering from severe trauma, intense stimulation, and massive hemorrhage, and should be rescued immediately.

　　Night sweats are sweat produced while one is asleep. Tuberculosis patients have this kind of sweat because they have a fever at night.

　　In addition, Chinese medicine practitioners have other names for sweat such as exhaustion sweat, collapse sweat, soul sweat, white sweat, yellow sweat, red sweat, etc., with a total of twenty types, which will not be described one by one here.

　　Finally, I would like to draw everyone's attention to one thing, which is that you should not catch a cold when sweating. When a person is sweating profusely, a sudden cool breeze blows, or they take a bath with extremely cold water, the small blood vessels, pores, and arrector pili muscles on the skin will contract tightly, and sweating will stop. As a result, the heat inside the body cannot be dissipated, which will cause symptoms such as fever, dizziness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. When it is too hot, it is best to find a shady place to rest for a while, fan yourself slowly, and drink some cool but not cold tea to allow the heat to dissipate fully.

### 各种各样的汗

    各种各样的汗
  　谢雨
    春夏秋冬，不分昼夜，人一直在出汗，不过热天出得多，自己觉得出，其他时候出得少，自己觉不出罢了。一个人一天的出汗量，如果不是热天，又不劳动，就有五百毫升，足够装二饭碗；如果是热天，就要多两倍光景；如果在高温车间，或是在干重活，八小时内就会出到平常一天的十倍到十七倍。
    汗能够带走身上的热。我们都有这样的经验：夏天把水泼到地面，地面和附近空气就凉爽些。这是因为：水到地面遇热会蒸发。地面的热被水的蒸发用掉了，温度就降低。出汗散热的道理，和这一样。一个大人，每出二斤汗，能使体温下降十二度（摄氏，下同）。
    汗从汗腺来。这是一种肉眼看不到的细长管子，一头开口在皮面上，另一头盘成一团，埋在皮肤的底层。这种管子，全身有二百万到三百万条，但是分布不均匀。额头、手心、脚底和腋窝最多，几乎每半寸见方的地方，就有汗腺三百条左右。如果没有汗腺或者汗腺出了毛病，一到夏天，热散不出去，就会发生喝水多和尿多的现象，甚至还会发烧。二岁以内的孩子最容易得这种病，医学上称作“小儿暑热症”。
    汗腺受神经管制。只要皮肤温度增加五度，或者血里的温度提高半度，这个刺激就传到我们脑的管理“热调节”的部分。于是它就立刻发布命令，要汗腺行动起来——出汗散热。这种出汗，全身都出。额头、脖子、胳臂、手背等地方出得更多。人在紧张、害怕、剧痛的时候，也会汗流浃背的。这是这部分的神经大肆活跃的结果。这种出汗，很少浑身都出，多半是手心脚底和腋窝出得最多。
    汗的滋味是咸的，里面九成九是水，余下的是盐和一些别的东西。一个人如果老是汗如雨下，身体里的水就会不足，盐也会发生亏欠。如果补充不及时，人就会病倒：恶心、不想吃、吐、口喝、尿少、身子发烧，严重的会昏迷、死亡。所以热天要多喝水，多吃咸食。
    有的人无缘无故会出一身大汗，稍一动，浑身如被雨浇，这叫多汗症，大多出现在精神容易紧张、或者身体虚弱、或者是胖子等人身上。得了“甲状腺机能亢进”这类病，也是终日汗出涔涔的。有些人的手心、脚底特别爱出汗，原因大概是神经对这些地方的汗腺调度有些失常。
    出汗多，对皮肤不大有利。汗把皮肤泡软了，很容易进去细菌，所以多汗的皮肤爱长疮疖。而且湿皮肤耐不得摩擦，所以又容易得皮疹。有些细菌喜欢在汗水里发展，会把汗水变成臭水。有些人的脚很臭，或者浑身一股酸臭味，那就是这类细菌搞的“成绩”。所以，夏天应该常洗澡。
    有的人出冷汗，情形是皮肤发凉而汗珠直冒，这多半是人在遭受严重创伤、剧烈的刺激和大出血当中的一种虚脱病象，应该立刻抢救。
    盗汗，是乘人熟睡时候出的汗。结核病人因为夜间发烧，所以就有这种汗。
    此外，中医学家还有绝汗、脱汗、魄汗、白汗、黄汗、红汗……等一起有二十种汗的名称，这里不一一叙述了。
    最后，提请大家注意一件事，就是出汗时候不宜着凉。一个人热得满头大汗，突然一阵凉风吹来，或者用极凉的水洗澡，皮肤上面的小血管、毛孔、立毛肌都会紧紧收缩起来，出汗停止了。这么一来，身体里面的热反而散发不出，就会引起发烧、头昏、胃呆、呕吐等等的症状。太热的时候，最好先找个荫处休息一下，缓缓的扇扇，喝些凉而不冷的茶，使热充分发散。
