Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 7th: A 24-hour general strike began today throughout Cyprus by Greeks, protesting the British army's atrocity of shooting Greek residents in the village of Avgoro.

    This morning, workers everywhere stopped work, and shops closed their doors. Transportation also came to a standstill.

    On the 5th, a group of British troops stormed into Avgoro village, a Greek resident settlement, forcibly tearing down slogans posted by local patriots against British colonial rule. This barbaric act was met with strong resistance from local residents. The British army opened fire on unarmed residents, resulting in the deaths of two Greek residents and injuries to nearly a hundred people.

    This atrocity by the British army immediately aroused the indignation of the Cypriot people. The day before the general strike began, the entire village of Avgoro, men, women, and children, held a solemn funeral with grief and anger for the two victims of the British army's atrocity. The British army sealed off the roads leading to the village, preventing residents of neighboring villages from attending the funeral. (Attached picture)

    The wave of the Cypriot people's struggle is surging more and more fiercely, frightening the British colonialists, who have to dispatch large numbers of soldiers and police every day to be heavily guarded on the streets of Nicosia.

    塞浦路斯希腊人总罢工
    抗议英殖民军屠杀平民
    新华社7日讯  尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯全岛各地的希腊人在今天开始二十四小时的总罢工，抗议英国军队在这个岛上的阿夫哥罗村枪杀希腊居民的暴行。
    今天上午，各地的工人都停了工，商店都关了门。交通运输也陷于停顿状态。
    在5日，一批英国军队冲进希腊族居民聚居的阿夫哥罗村，强行撕毁当地的爱国者张贴的反对英国殖民统治的标语。这种蛮横行为遭到了当地居民的强烈反抗。英军竟向手无寸铁的居民开枪，结果有两个希腊族居民被打死，有近百人受伤。
    英国军队的这种暴行立刻激起了塞浦路斯人民的义愤。在总罢工开始的前一天，阿夫哥罗村全村的男女老幼怀着悲愤的心情为这两位英军暴行的牺牲者举行了隆重的葬礼。英军封锁了通往这个村庄的道路，阻止邻近村庄的居民参加送葬。（附图片）
    塞浦路斯人民斗争的浪潮日益汹涌澎湃，英国殖民者心惊胆战，每日不得不出动大批军警，在尼科西亚街上严加戒备。
