    Guangzhou Paper Mill炼铁制水泥 [Refining Iron and Manufacturing Cement]
    Xinhua News Agency report: Workers at the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill are utilizing a large quantity of waste materials as raw materials to refine pig iron and manufacture alcohol and clinker-free cement.
    At the end of June, the "Iron Refining Group" of the Guangzhou Paper Mill successfully smelted the first batch of pig iron using pyrite cinder as raw material in an ordinary cupola furnace. Originally, in the process of producing calcium sulfite solution for papermaking, the Guangzhou Paper Mill discarded 20 to 40 tons of pyrite cinder as waste every day. Recently, they discovered that the iron content of pyrite cinder is quite high and specifically established an "Iron Refining Group" to study it, achieving success after numerous trials. If all the pyrite cinder in this factory is utilized, it can produce 12 to 15 tons of pig iron daily.
    The coal-fired boiler of this paper mill produces 70 to 80 tons of coal ash every day, which has always been treated as useless waste. Now, this factory has used this coal ash mixed with lime and gypsum to produce clinker-free cement of good quality. The annual output of clinker-free cement made from coal ash by this factory can reach 10,000 tons.
    The Guangzhou Paper Mill has approximately 1,080 cubic meters of waste sulfite liquor from chemical wood pulp digestion every day. The paper mill is building an alcohol factory to recover all of this waste sulfite liquor for use as a raw material for manufacturing alcohol, which can produce approximately more than 3,000 tons of alcohol annually.
    The Guangzhou Paper Mill is making full use of existing equipment and installations, and is also increasing necessary equipment with a small amount of investment to prepare for the construction of an iron refining plant, a turpentine manufacturing plant, a clinker-free cement plant, and an alcohol manufacturing plant. All four of these factories can be formally put into production this year.

    广州造纸厂炼铁制水泥
    据新华社讯　国营广州造纸厂工人利用大量的废弃物品做原料，炼出了生铁，制成了酒精、无熟料水泥。
    6月底广州造纸厂“炼铁组”的职工们，在一个普通的冲天炉里炼出了第一炉用硫铁矿渣做原料冶炼出来的生铁。原来，广州造纸厂在生产供造纸用的亚硫酸钙药液过程中，每天有二十吨到四十吨硫铁矿渣当作废物弃掉。最近他们发现硫铁矿渣的含铁量相当高，就专门设立了一个“炼铁组”来研究，经过多次试制获得成功。这个工厂的硫铁矿渣如果全部加以利用，每天可以生产生铁十二吨到十五吨。
    这个造纸厂的煤粉锅炉每天有七十吨到八十吨的煤灰，一向也是当作无用废物处理的。现在，这个厂已经利用这些煤灰配上石灰、石膏，生产出无熟料水泥，质量良好。这个工厂利用煤灰做的无熟料水泥，年产量可以达到一万吨。
    广州造纸厂蒸煮化学木浆后的亚硫酸废液，每天大约有一千零八十立方公尺。造纸厂正在建造一个酒精厂，把这些亚硫酸废液全部收回，用来作为制造酒精的原料，每年可生产约三千多吨酒精。
    广州造纸厂正在充分利用现有的设备和装置，并且用小量的投资增加必要的设备，筹建炼铁厂、松节油制造厂、无熟料水泥厂、酒精制造厂等，这四个工厂今年都可正式投入生产。
