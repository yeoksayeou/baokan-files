    "Cotton King"
    A "Cotton King" plant bearing 467 cotton bolls has been discovered in Binchuan County, Yunnan Province. This "Cotton King" grows in an oily sandy field by the river in the Fourth Production Team of the Qian Su Commune in Binchuan. Unlike other cotton plants, it was sown in March this year and has now reached a height of 120 centimeters. It once had 480 buds, but 13 small bolls fell off due to weather conditions. Most of the existing 467 small bolls have already burst and are producing cotton. According to a detailed investigation by local agricultural technicians, the average weight of each boll is 5 grams. Based on the existing number of cotton bolls, this "Cotton King" can yield at least four catties of seed cotton.
    This "Cotton King" is of the "373" variety. During its growth period, in addition to weeding four times, fertilizing four times, and spraying eight times, the commune members did not carry out any pruning or topping.
    Binchuan County is a major cotton-producing area in Yunnan. The discovery of this "Cotton King" has given the whole county confidence in striving for a large-scale cotton yield of 1,000 catties of lint cotton per mu this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “棉花王”
    云南省宾川县发现一株结桃四百六十七个的“棉花王”。这株棉花王生长在宾川前所社第四生产队靠河边的一块油沙地里。它与其他棉株不同，今年3月份播种，现株高已达一百二十公分，曾现结蕾四百八十个，因气候缘故脱落了十三个小桃，现有的四百六十七个小桃子大部已经破铃吐絮。据当地农业技术人员的详细考察，平均每一个桃子的重量达五克，以现有棉桃计算，这株棉王最少能收四斤籽棉。
    这株“棉花王”是“373”品种，在生长期间，社员们除了薅过四次草，施肥四次，打过八次药之外，并没有进行整技打尖。
    宾川县是云南主要产棉区，这株棉王的发现为全县今年争取大面积棉花亩产一千斤皮棉树立了信心。　　（新华社）
