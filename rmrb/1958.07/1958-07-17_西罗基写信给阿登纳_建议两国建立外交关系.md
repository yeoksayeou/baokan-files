Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 15th: Czechoslovak Premier Viliam Široký has written to West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, suggesting that the two countries establish diplomatic relations. In the letter, he stated that the Czechoslovak government is ready to begin negotiations on this issue immediately, either in Prague, Bonn, or elsewhere.

Široký pointed out in the letter, dated July 1st, that the normalization of relations between the two countries would help ease international tensions and the situation in Europe, and would benefit the people of both countries.

Široký noted in the letter his concern about the recent decision by the West German Bundestag to arm the West German army with atomic weapons, and that some forces within West Germany are making territorial demands and expressing a willingness to serve the American aggressor bloc.
