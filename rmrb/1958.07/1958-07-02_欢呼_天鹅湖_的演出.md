    Cheers for the Performance of "Swan Lake"
    Zhu Shulan
    Last night, the Beijing Dance School gave its first public performance of the world-famous classical ballet "Swan Lake." This is a very exciting and joyous event since the great leap forward in China's literary and art circles.
    "Swan Lake" is known in the West as the pinnacle of classical ballet. Until now, no other ballet school in the world has attempted to rehearse it in its entirety; professional ballet troupes in capitalist countries rarely perform the entire ballet these days. In 1954, the Soviet National Moscow Musical Theatre's performance of "Swan Lake" in Beijing caused a sensation; due to the limited number of performances, many people were unable to appreciate it and felt regret. At that time, I also anxiously consulted some dancers, inquiring when we would be able to see our own performance of "Swan Lake." The answers I received were almost like pouring cold water: "It's very early, not for ten years, or at least seven or eight years." Indeed, in that year, our dance school had just been established, and the large-scale training of ballet talents had only just begun; for those who were superstitious about Western techniques and regarded ballet as a mysterious and unattainable art form, performing "Swan Lake" was even more of a distant dream.
    Only four years have passed. A few days ago, I met a young teacher from the dance school. After he told me the news that "Swan Lake" was about to be staged, he excitedly said: "If it were last year, or before the Great Leap Forward, we really wouldn't have dared to think that we could rehearse 'Swan Lake' so quickly." What this comrade said is good and makes sense; before the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, under the shackles of bourgeois literary and artistic thought, especially among young dance workers, superstition about foreign countries and technology was quite serious. The Rightists even openly clamored that the Party could not lead the dance world, saying that amateurs could not lead professionals. Now, the facts prove that after the anti-Rightist struggle, and under the impetus of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the Beijing Dance School, by putting politics in command, breaking down superstitions, and liberating thought, has, with the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, rehearsed and staged the entire "Swan Lake," which is known as the pinnacle of classical ballet, in just over four months. This is truly a new style of daring to think and dare to act for Chinese literary and art workers, and it is worthy of the heroic spirit of the worker-peasant brothers catching up with Britain and the United States.
    Let us cheer for the performance of "Swan Lake"! Let us cheer for the greater achievements of dance art!

    欢呼“天鹅湖”的演出
    朱树兰
    昨晚，北京舞蹈学校首次公演了世界著名的古典芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”，这是我国文艺界大跃进以来一件非常令人兴奋的大喜事。
    “天鹅湖”在西方被称为古典芭蕾舞剧的顶峰。到目前为止，世界上还没有其他国家的芭蕾舞学校，作过全部排练它的尝试；资本主义国家的职业芭蕾舞剧团如今更是难得全部上演这出舞剧。1954年，苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院来京演出“天鹅湖”，曾经轰动一时；因为演出场次的限制，许多人得不到欣赏的机会而感到遗憾。当时，我也曾怀着急切的心情，请教过一些舞蹈家，打听什么时候能够看到我们自己演出的“天鹅湖”。得到的回答差不多都像是给泼了一盆冷水：“早得很哪，没有十年，也得七、八年。”的确，那一年，我们的舞蹈学校刚建立，比较有规模的培养芭蕾舞人才还刚开始；对于那些迷信西洋技术，把芭蕾舞看成神秘，高不可攀的艺术形式的人来说，演出“天鹅湖”更是可望而不可及的事情。
    事隔不过四年。前几天，我碰见了一位舞蹈学校的年轻教员，他告诉我“天鹅湖”就要上演的消息以后，兴奋地说：“如果是在去年，或是大跃进以前，我们真不敢想这么快能排演出‘天鹅湖’”。这位同志的话说得好，有道理；在整风、反右派斗争以前，舞蹈界在资产阶级文艺思想的束缚下，特别是在青年舞蹈工作者中间，迷信外国、迷信技术是相当严重的。右派分子更是公开叫嚣，说党不能领导舞蹈界，说什么外行不能领导内行。如今，事实证明，北京舞蹈学校经过了反右派斗争，在全国工农业生产大跃进的推动下，政治挂帅，破除了迷信，解放了思想，在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，仅仅四个多月的时间，就把这出被称作古典芭蕾舞剧顶峰的“天鹅湖”全部排练出来上演，真是我国文艺工作者敢想敢干的新风格，无愧于工农兄弟赶上英国、美国的英雄气概。
    让我们为“天鹅湖”的演出欢呼！为舞蹈艺术的更大成就欢呼！
