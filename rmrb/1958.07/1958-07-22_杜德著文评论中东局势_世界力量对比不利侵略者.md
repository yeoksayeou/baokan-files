Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th -- The "Daily Worker" published an article by Pam Dutt, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Great Britain, on the 19th under the title "Middle East: Peace or War?".

The article first pointed out that the US-British armed intervention in the Middle East "is not a sudden, unexpected, small-scale military adventure," but the most serious war crisis since the Korean War and the Suez Canal crisis.

The article said that the US-British aggression in the Middle East was obviously planned and prepared for several weeks or even months. They assembled a large number of armed forces, warships, artillery, special commandoes, and aircraft, and even a tactical air force unit with atomic bombs; its scale far exceeded that of the Suez Canal crisis. The article said that it is certain that "this offensive strategy was formulated during the recent talks between Eisenhower and Macmillan in Washington."

The article emphasized that this was by no means a sudden decision made solely due to the Iraqi revolution. On the contrary, the Iraqi revolution was a response to this Anglo-American offensive. The Iraqi revolution timely prevented the Baghdad Pact Council meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held a few hours later. This war offensive was originally planned to be launched at this meeting.

The article pointed out that the reason why US and British imperialism are carrying out this reckless and sinful gamble is because their anger at the progress of the Arab cause of freedom is beyond description. They want to do everything possible to put the people of the Middle East back in shackles.

The article said that Iraq has now broken free from these shackles. The last bastion of imperialism, the hub and cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact, has collapsed, and the Republic of Iraq has been declared on the basis of Arab freedom and the principles of neutralism and the Bandung Conference. Therefore, Western countries have begun to despair. They are faced with only two choices: either to recognize Arab freedom and end their intervention, or to wage an all-out war to restore their lost position. They have chosen the latter, fatal path.

The article said that the US and British governments have already begun their last and most desperate military gamble in the Middle East. They first started this gamble in Lebanon and Jordan. They are also coveting Iraq, Yemen, and the entire Middle East. However, the Arab national independence movement is absolutely indestructible. The Suez Canal crisis showed that the world balance of power is unfavorable to those warmongering rulers who attempt to turn back the wheels of history. But in this reckless gamble, they could ignite a conflagration that spreads to the whole world. Therefore, it is urgently necessary, while there is still time, to use the united strength of the entire labor movement, all the people, and the people of all countries in the world to stop this gamble.

    杜德著文评论中东局势
    世界力量对比不利侵略者
    新华社20日讯  伦敦消息：“工人日报”19日在“中东是和平还是战争？”的标题下刊载了英国共产党副主席帕姆·杜德的文章。
    文章首先指出，美英对中东的武装干涉“并不是突然的、出乎意料的、小规模的军事冒险”，而是自从朝鲜战争和苏伊士事件以来最严重的战争危机。
    文章说，美英在中东的侵略行动显然经过了好几个星期甚至好几个月的策划和准备。它们集结了大批武装部队、军舰、大炮、特别突击队和飞机，甚至还有一支拥有原子弹的战术空军部队；其规模远远超过了苏伊士事件的时候。文章说，可以肯定，“这种攻势战略是在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦最近在华盛顿举行会谈的时候拟定的”。
    文章强调说，这绝不是仅仅由于伊拉克革命事件而突然作出的决定。恰恰相反，伊拉克革命是对英美这种攻势的答复。伊拉克的革命及时地阻止了原定在几小时之后召开的巴格达条约理事会会议。本来计划在这次会议上发动这种战争攻势。
    文章指出，美、英帝国主义所以要进行这种不顾死活的、罪恶的赌博，是因为它们对阿拉伯自由事业的进展感到的愤怒是无以复加的。它们要想尽一切办法要重新给中东人民戴上枷锁。
    文章说，现在伊拉克已经挣脱了这种桎梏。帝国主义最后的堡垒、巴格达条约的枢纽和基石已经垮台了，伊拉克共和国已经在阿拉伯自由以及中立主义和万隆会议的原则的基础上宣告成立。因此，西方国家开始绝望了。摆在它们面前的只有两个选择：要就是承认阿拉伯的自由和结束它们的干涉，要就是进行一次全面的大战来恢复它们已经失去的地位。它们已经选择了后面这条致命的道路。
    文章说，美英两国政府已经在中东开始了它们最后也是最绝望的军事赌博。它们首先在黎巴嫩和约旦开始了这种赌博。它们还在觊觎着伊拉克、也门和整个中东。但是，阿拉伯民族独立运动是绝对摧毁不了的。苏伊士事件表明，世界力量的对比对于那些企图使历史车轮倒转的战争狂统治者是不利的。但是在这种不顾死活的赌博中，它们能够点起蔓延到全世界的战火。因此，迫切需要在时间还来得及的时候，用整个劳工运动、全体人民和全世界所有国家人民联合一致的力量来制止这场赌博。
