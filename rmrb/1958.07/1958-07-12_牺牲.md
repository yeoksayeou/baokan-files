Notes

    Sacrifice
    The de Gaulle government is preparing to launch a "sacrifice movement" in France. Since this movement is named "sacrifice," it inevitably raises the question of sacrifice for whom and who is to sacrifice.

    Sacrifice for whom? It is said to be for the interests of France. Specifically, it is to cope with France's current financial difficulties. However, everyone knows that the root cause of France's financial woes lies in the colonial war being waged in Algeria, and France is waging this dirty war to protect the wallets of those monopoly groups that have huge colonial interests in Algeria. Therefore, the "sacrifice movement" promoted by the de Gaulle government is actually for the benefit of only a few big bosses in France.

    Who is to sacrifice? It is said to be the people of all strata in France. However, according to the disclosed information, the content of this movement mainly includes freezing wages and increasing taxes. Therefore, it is actually the broad working people who are being asked to make sacrifices.

    When de Gaulle came to power, he said that his government was a "national government" that transcended the interests of all classes. But the fact is obvious that the de Gaulle government wants the working people to sacrifice for the interests of the big bosses. Isn't it clear which class it represents?

    牺牲
    戴高乐政府准备在法国推行一个“牺牲运动”。既然这个运动以“牺牲”为名，那不免就有为谁牺牲和要谁牺牲的问题。
    为谁牺牲呢？据说是为了法国的利益。具体地说，是为了应付法国目前的财政困难。但是，谁都知道，使法国财政陷于困境的祸根是在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，而法国打这场肮脏战争是为了保卫那些在阿尔及利亚有巨大殖民利益的垄断集团的钱袋。因此，戴高乐政府推行的“牺牲运动”，实际上为的不过是法国的少数大老板而已。
    要谁牺牲呢？据说是法国各阶层的人民。但是，根据透露出来的消息，这项运动的内容主要是冻结工资和增加赋税。因此，被要求作出牺牲的实际上是广大的劳动人民。
    戴高乐上台时曾经说，他的政府是超乎各个阶级的利益以上的“全民政府”。但是事实很明显，戴高乐政府要劳动人民为大老板的利益牺牲，它究竟代表什么阶级不是明明白白的吗？
