    Grandpa's Words
    Zhu Zicai, Farmer, Zhongqi Cooperative, Baiquan County, Heilongjiang
    The new society is truly good,
    Things I never imagined I’ve seen:
    Wired broadcast hanging on the wall,
    The cooperative already has a telephone,
    The county holds a broadcast meeting,
    I remember it all sitting at home.
    An old grandpa said it well,
    This box is truly a treasure,
    It knows about wind and rain in advance,
    Reports on national events every day,
    It can sing and play music,
    Cross-talk and clapper talks are wonderfully told.
    Everyone says there are gods and treasures,
    But now I don't believe it,
    The working people are the gods,
    Scientific things are all treasures.

    老爷爷的话
    黑龙江拜泉县中起社农民  祝智财
    新社会，真正好，
    想不到的都看到了：
    有线广播墙上挂，
    社里已经有电话，
    县里召开广播会，
    坐在家里全记下。
    有位爷爷说的好，
    这个匣子真是宝，
    刮风下雨它先知道，
    国家的大事每天报，
    会唱歌，能奏乐，
    相声、快板说的妙。
    都说有神又有宝，
    这下我可不信了，
    劳动人民就是神，
    科学东西都是宝。
