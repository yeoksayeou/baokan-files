Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 25th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a telephone conference of prefectural Party committee secretaries, calling on the entire Party and people of Guangdong to urgently mobilize and adopt various measures to catch up with the new situation of rapid advancement in national grain production and ensure a bumper late rice harvest.

The meeting was presided over by Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. After discussing the national grain production situation, Tao Zhu said that although Guangdong's early rice crop was good, it was not outstanding compared to some provinces in the country. Our late rice production, although not lacking enthusiasm, is also not very significant compared to the rest of the country. Guangdong Province's grain production was originally slightly higher than other provinces, but now it is likely to be lower than some provinces. The Shantou Prefecture of Guangdong Province was the first prefecture in China to reach 800 jin per mu, and the first large-scale high-yield prefecture, but now it faces serious challenges from prefectures both inside and outside the province. Some time ago, we thought that our early rice transplanting was denser than other provinces, but recently we learned that Hunan and Hubei are denser than us. In addition, we are not better than others in terms of early transplanting, fertilization, and seed selection. So, is it any wonder that other provinces have higher yields of early rice than us? The growing period of early rice in other provinces is longer, and the growing period of late rice is shorter. In Guangdong Province, the growing period of late rice is longer than that of early rice. It has always been "four for early and six for late," and late rice production has always been better. The natural conditions and mass conditions in Guangdong Province are not worse than other provinces. As long as the Party leadership recognizes the situation, eliminates arrogance, catches up quickly, is determined, and takes practical measures to make this year's late rice production a greater leap forward, Guangdong Province's grain production can regain its top position and continue to stand at the forefront of national grain production.

The local Party secretaries fully agreed with the Provincial Party Committee's view of the current national and Guangdong Province grain production situation.

Tao Zhu said that determination is very important, but in comparison, the most important thing is measures. These measures are: (1) Ensure that all 37 million mu of late rice are transplanted before the Beginning of Autumn, with a density that guarantees at least 400,000 ears. (2) Immediately after transplanting, conduct the most stringent field management to ensure that no weeds grow, fertilize in a timely manner, and apply continuous topdressing five, six, or seven times, providing the late rice with whatever fertilizer it needs during its growth. (3) Resolutely eliminate the three types of rice. (4) Prevent lodging by deep plowing to a depth of seven inches before transplanting to ensure that the seedling roots are strong; when transplanting, the plant spacing should be dense and the row spacing should be wider to ensure adequate ventilation and sunlight; implement reasonable irrigation and drainage; apply more potash fertilizer and control nitrogen fertilizer. (5) More importantly, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and dare to implement technical revolutions in cultivation methods. To this end, the Party committee must immediately launch a major propaganda campaign to make the masses aware of the new situation of increased grain production nationwide and throughout the province, and that this year we must extract more grain from nature. Cadres and activists should all go to the fields to cultivate 6 million mu of experimental fields and use their own living examples to guide production. In the early rice distribution, correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and distribution. After completing the grain purchase task and deducting feed grain and seed grain, all agricultural cooperatives must resolutely distribute the remaining increased grain to the members to increase food rations. If there is a shortage of labor, resolutely promote the improvement of agricultural tools, reasonably adjust labor organization, and universally run public canteens and nurseries to further tap the labor potential of women and enable them to participate in agricultural production.

    认清形势  去掉骄气  拿出办法
    广东力争粮食增产再居上游
    据新华社广州25日电　中共广东省委最近召开地委书记电话会议，号召广东全党全民紧急动员，采取各种措施，赶上全国粮食生产突飞猛进的新形势，保证晚稻大丰收。
    会议由中共广东省委第一书记陶铸主持。陶铸在谈了全国粮食增产情况以后说，广东省的早造虽然不错，但比起全国某些省份，我们就不够突出；我们的晚造生产，虽然劲头不算太小，但比起全国也不是很大。广东省粮食生产原先比别省略高些，但现在比某些省很可能要低些了；广东省汕头专区是我国第一个八百斤专区，第一个大面积高产专区，现在却面临着内外各专区的严重挑战。前个时间，我们还以为今年早稻插秧比别省插得密，但是最近才知道湖南、湖北比我们密。此外，在早插、施肥、选种方面，我们也并不比人家好。这样，人家早稻比我们高产些还有什么奇怪呢？别省早稻生长期长些，晚稻生长期短些，广东省则晚稻生长期比早稻生长期长，向来是“早四晚六”，晚造生产一向好些；广东省自然条件和群众条件并不比别省差，只要党的领导认清形势，去掉骄气、急起直追，下定决心，拿出切实措施，使今年晚造生产来个更大的飞跃，广东省粮食增产就可以再居上游，继续站到全国粮食生产的前列。
    各地委书记完全同意省委关于目前全国和广东省粮食生产形势的看法。
    陶铸说，决心很重要，但比较起来，最重要的还是措施。这些措施是：（1）三千七百万亩晚稻，保证在立秋前插好秧，密植的规格至少要保证长出四十万穗。（2）插秧以后，紧接着进行最严格的田间管理，保证不长一根草，及时施肥，做到连续追肥五、六、七次，晚稻生长中需要什么肥就给它什么肥。（3）坚决消灭三类禾。（4）防止倒伏，插秧前，一律深耕七寸，使苗根扎实；插秧时，株距宜密，行距宽点，做到通风阳光足；合理排灌；多施钾肥，控制氮肥。（5）更重要的是充分发挥群众的干劲和创造性，敢于实行栽培方法上的技术革命。为此，党委要立刻展开一个大的宣传运动，向群众讲清全国全省粮食增产的新形势，今年要向自然索取更多的粮食；干部和积极分子都下田去，种好六百万亩试验田，用自己活的榜样指导生产；早造分配中正确处理积累和分配的关系，所有农业社在完成粮食征购任务、扣下饲料粮、种籽粮以后，要把其余增产部分的粮食坚决地分给社员增加口粮；劳动力不足，要坚决推行改良农具、合理调整劳动组织、普遍办公共食堂与托儿所，进一步发挥妇女劳动潜力，使她们参加农业生产。
