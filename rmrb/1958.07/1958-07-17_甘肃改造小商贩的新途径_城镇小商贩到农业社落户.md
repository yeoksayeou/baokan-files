Lanzhou, July 16 (Report from this newspaper) The Finance and Trade Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and the Gansu Provincial Department of Commerce, in their pilot work of "three cooperatives merged into one" in Luomen Town, Wushan County (basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives merged into agricultural cooperatives, with supply and marketing and credit service departments established separately within the agricultural cooperatives), have transferred urban small traders to settle down in agricultural cooperatives, engaging in both agriculture and commerce, to support agricultural production in the long term. This has created a new path for financial and trade work to support the great leap forward in agricultural production and thoroughly transform rural small traders.

After the "three cooperatives merged into one," urban small traders, along with their funds, joined the supply and marketing service department within the agricultural cooperative. The supply and marketing service department became a service institution collectively owned by the agricultural cooperative, responsible for supplying daily necessities and small-scale means of production within the cooperative, and purchasing agricultural and sideline products and waste products from the members. The funds of the service department come partly from the small traders and partly from the shares transferred from the original basic-level supply and marketing cooperative. After the small traders arrive at the service department, they engage in both agriculture and commerce, and the agricultural cooperative determines a fixed work point remuneration each year based on the size of the business and the service attitude, etc. Part of these work points must be obtained by directly participating in labor. Before the autumn harvest distribution, in order to maintain current living standards, it is stipulated that part of the work point remuneration will be paid in cash each month, and part will be paid after participating in the autumn distribution.

The agricultural cooperative will not develop capitalist tendencies because it engages in commerce or because the service department is operated by former traders, because state-owned commerce does not give the service department wholesale-retail price differences, only a 2.3% handling fee based on the purchase and sales volume, which is just enough for the service department to maintain its business. In addition, it is stipulated that the service department should purchase and deliver goods at fixed state-owned stores and obey the leadership of state-owned commerce, so that the service department can only be purely service-oriented. After the families of the small traders join the cooperative along with the small traders, appropriate labor and work are assigned according to their specific circumstances. Only a few capitalists with more funds and larger turnover and some elderly and infirm people are left in the original towns. The supply and marketing service department where the small traders are located is equivalent to a state-owned commercial agency in the agricultural cooperative. The service department sends a purchase and sales plan to the state-owned commercial agency once a month, and the state-owned commerce allocates goods based on the plans collected from various agricultural cooperatives.

The implementation of this experience has brought many benefits to agricultural cooperatives and towns, to farmers and small traders: (1) It solves the problem of the disconnection between supply and marketing due to the large number and scattered distribution of agricultural cooperatives and the small number and concentrated distribution of purchase points; (2) It saves a large amount of labor force going to market; at the same time, after the small traders and their families go down, they also add a batch of labor force to the countryside; (3) It strengthens the relationship between urban and rural areas and further narrows the gap between urban and rural areas; (4) Small traders settle in the countryside for a long time, directly participate in production, are closer to reality, and change the shortcomings of the past, such as goods not being suitable and supply not being timely; (5) Because small traders replace a part of the retail business of state-owned commerce, it is convenient for state-owned commerce to streamline its institutions; (6) Small traders have a place to belong, and the state saves the original loans, relief, and other care for them each year.

    甘肃改造小商贩的新途径
    城镇小商贩到农业社落户
    本报兰州16日电　中共甘肃省委财贸部和甘肃省商业厅在武山县洛门镇试办三社合一（基层供销社和信用社合并到农业社、在农业社内分别成立供销、信用服务部）工作中，把城镇小商贩下放到农业社安家落户，半农半商，长期支援农业生产，为财贸工作支援农业生产大跃进和彻底改造乡村小商贩创造了新途径。
    “三社合一”以后，城镇小商贩连人带资金加入农业社内的供销服务部。供销服务部成为农业社集体所有的服务性机构，负责社内日常生活资料和小型生产资料的供应，收购社员中的农副产品和废品。服务部的资金，一部分是小商贩带去的，一部分是原来基层供销社转去的股金。小商贩到服务部后，亦农亦商，由农业社根据业务大小和服务态度等，规定每年固定的工分报酬。这些工分中有一部分要由他直接参加劳动获得。在秋收分配前，为了维持当前生活，规定工分报酬一部分每月付现金，一部分待参加秋后分配。
    农业社不会因为经营商业和因为服务部是过去的商贩在经营而发生资本主义倾向，因为国营商业不给服务部批零差价，只给购销额2.3％的手续费，刚够服务部维持营业。此外还规定服务部在固定的国营商店进货交货、服从国营商业领导，使服务部只能是纯粹服务性质。小商贩的家属随同小商贩入社后，按本人具体情况，分配适当的劳动和工作。原来的城镇只留下少数资金较多、营业额较大的资本家和一些老弱者，小商贩所在的供销服务部等于国营商业在农业社的代理机构，服务部每月向国营商业机关送一次购销计划，国营商业根据各个农业社汇集起来的计划调拨进货。
    推行这一经验给农业社和城镇、给农民和小商贩都带来了很多好处：（1）解决了农业社多而分散，购货点少而集中的供销脱节现象；（2）节省了大批上街赶集的劳动力；同时小商贩和他们的家属下去后，又给农村增加了一批劳动力；（3）密切了城乡关系，进一步缩小城乡之间的差别；（4）小商贩长期在农村落户，直接参加生产，更接近于实际，改变过去商品不对路、供应不及时等缺点；（5）由于小商贩代替了国营商业一部分零售业务，便于国营商业精简机构；（6）小商贩有了归宿，国家节省了原来每年对他们的贷款、救济和其他照顾。
