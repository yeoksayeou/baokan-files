Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 10th. According to the forecast released by the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in mid-July, the Soviet satellite will fly over China from southwest to northeast around dusk every day.

To facilitate the observation of this artificial satellite by the general public, the Observatory has specially prepared a map of the route of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite over China from the 11th to the 15th (see picture). The map shows nine different routes that the satellite will pass over China during these days. Each route is marked with two imaginary locations, A and B, to facilitate determining the passing time. According to calculations, it takes the satellite about six minutes to fly from point A to point B. The time it passes through other areas along the same route can be estimated according to the distance ratio.

The approximate times (Beijing time) when the satellite passes through point A of each route are now announced as follows:

Month/Day  Route   1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
July 11                                                 21:49
July 12           20:37                         22:22
July 13                     21:11                       22:56
July 14     19:59                         21:44
July 15               20:33                         22:18

It can be seen from the third route in the table above that the satellite will pass point A (north of Nanning) at about 20:33 Beijing time on the 15th. Therefore, it can be inferred that it will pass Nanning at about 20:32, Zhengzhou at about 20:36, and Beijing and Tianjin at about 20:37.5, and then fly northeast.

When an artificial satellite flies over, it is often not possible to see the entire route due to different sunlight conditions. Therefore, in the figure above, areas where visibility is poor are marked with dashed lines, while solid lines indicate areas where it can be seen. For example, on the third route, the area north of Beijing and Tianjin is drawn with a dashed line, indicating that it cannot be seen due to poor sunlight conditions.

The artificial satellite is not very bright when it appears, equivalent to a third or fourth magnitude star. It moves slowly across the sky. It is estimated that when the weather is clear and cloudless, it can be seen with the naked eye within about 200 kilometers on either side of the solid lines drawn in the above figure.

    苏联第三个人造卫星11—15日飞过我国各地的时间
    新华社南京10日电　据中国科学院紫金山天文台发布的预告，本月中旬，苏联卫星将于每日黄昏前后从西南向东北飞过我国上空。
    为便于广大群众对这个人造卫星进行肉眼观察，天文台特制定了一张苏联第三个人造卫星11日至15日经过我国路线图（见图）。图中标明了卫星在这几天经过我国的不同的九条路线，每条路线各标明便于查明经过时间的甲、乙两个假想地点。据计算，卫星从甲点到乙点约需飞行六分钟，它经过同一路线其他地区时间可按照距离比例来推算。
    现在将卫星经过各条路线甲点的近似时间（北京时间）预报表公布如下：月日 　路线 　1  　2　  3  　4  　5  　6  　7  　8  　97月11　                        21∶497月12          20∶37　                  22∶227月13　                    21∶11                 　22∶567月14    　19∶59                 　21∶447月15　              20∶33　                 22∶18
    从上表第三条路线可以看出，15日北京时间二十点三十三分左右卫星将经过甲点（南宁以北），因之可以推算出二十点三十二分左右经过南宁，二十点三十六分左右过郑州，二十点三十七分半左右过北京、天津，然后向东北飞去。
    人造卫星飞过时，由于日光照射条件的不同，往往不是整条路线都可看到，因此，在上图中，由于条件不好而看不到的地区就标以虚线，实线则是可以看到的地区。如第三条路线上，北京、天津以北画的是虚线，便表示由于日光照射条件不好而不能看到。
    人造卫星出现时不很明亮，相当于三、四等星。它在天空缓缓移动，天气晴朗无云时，估计沿上图所绘实线两侧各约二百公里以内地区，可以用肉眼看到它。（附图片）
