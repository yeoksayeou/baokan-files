    Analog Electronic Computer
    Can Help Design Atomic Energy Reactors as Control Equipment for Automated Factories
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th - Chen Guoyao and Song Baichuan, two young technicians in their twenties from the Shanghai Joint State-Private Lei Magnetic Instrument Factory, have recently successfully trial-produced an analog electronic computer, which is operating well.
    This analog electronic computer can replace the labor of 10,000 people or solve complex mathematical problems that would take five or six mathematicians half a month to calculate. It can help scientific research departments design automatically controlled atomic energy reactors, solve complex linear and nonlinear differential equations, and can also be used as automatic control equipment for various automated factories, railway systems, and power grids.
    Chen Guoyao and Song Baichuan are both graduates of the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University in 1953. With the full support of the Xuhui District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the cooperation of five nearby factories, they carried out this trial production work.

    模拟式电子计算机
    可以帮助设计原子能反应堆作自动化工厂的控制设备
    新华社上海11日电　上海公私合营雷磁仪器厂两个二十多岁的青年技术员陈国尧、宋百川，最近试制成功一台模拟式电子计算机，运转情况良好。
    这台模拟式电子计算机可以顶替一万个人的劳动或五六个数学家花半个月时间才能计算出来的复杂数学题目。它可以帮助科学研究部门设计自动控制的原子能反应堆，解出复杂的线性和作线性微分方程式，也可以作为各种自动化工厂、铁路系统、电力网的自动控制设备。
    陈国尧和宋百川都是1953年交通大学电机系毕业的学生。他们在中共徐汇区委的全力支持和附近五个工厂的协作下，进行了这项试制工作。
