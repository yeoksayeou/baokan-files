How the High Wheat Yield Record Was Created
First Secretary of the Guanghua County Party Committee, Zheng Shaobo

    The fifth production team of the Yongjin Agricultural Cooperative in Bailian Township, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has a plot of wheat that grew particularly well this year. Walking into the field, you could only see heads, not bodies. Moreover, all the wheat in the field had tall, thick stalks and long, large ears, without any lodging. When it was almost harvest time, several women casually rubbed a few ears in the field and counted them: one ear had 88 grains of wheat, another had 85 grains, and even the fewest had more than 50 grains.

    Harvesting began. To determine exactly how much wheat this plot yielded, cadres were sent from the guidance group (district) and township to verify the results, and many cooperative members also voluntarily participated in harvesting and threshing. After measurement, this plot totaled 1.21 mu. The verification results showed a total of 4383.4 jin of wheat, averaging 3622.5 jin per mu.

    The creators of such high yields are also ordinary working people: Li Xiulan, the women's director and Communist Youth League branch committee member of Yongjin Cooperative, and Chen Benxue, the cooperative's technology officer. Li Xiulan is 25 years old this year, from a poor peasant family, and attended primary school for four years after liberation. Chen Benxue is still illiterate.

    How exactly did they achieve such high yields? To answer this question, we need to start from the beginning.

    At the end of September last year, Li Xiulan followed a tour group organized by the township branch to the Bayi Agricultural Cooperative in Hugang Township, Gucheng County, to learn about wheat planting experience. It was there that she heard a women's director introduce a high-yield wheat experiment with a planned yield of 1000 jin per mu. This immediately sparked a mental struggle in Li Xiulan: "She is a woman, and I am also a woman. If she can do a thousand-jin experiment, why can't I?" She also thought, "The Party often teaches us to study diligently and create boldly?" Thinking this way, her enthusiasm grew. On the way back to the township, she discussed it with Chen Benxue, the cooperative's technology officer: they would cooperate to conduct a thousand-jin high-yield experiment after returning.

    At the team committee meeting, Li Xiulan reported their plan to the team committee. Most of the team committee members supported them, encouraging them by saying, "Go ahead, if there is not enough fertilizer, the team will find a way to allocate it!" But some team committee members did not believe they could succeed, saying sarcastically, "Okay! Maybe you can harvest something, right?"

    The news that Li Xiulan and Chen Benxue were going to conduct a thousand-jin experiment spread. Many cooperative members, especially some older farmers, thought they were "fooling around" after hearing about it, and could not believe that wheat could be produced at 1000 jin per mu. A cooperative member named Chen Detian, after hearing that they were going to conduct a thousand-jin experiment, ran over to ask Li Xiulan: "Have you calculated how much one thousand jin is?" Without waiting for Li Xiulan to answer, he said, "One thousand jin is more than three shi and seven dou of grain; three shi and seven dou per mu, three dou and seven per fen, this will pave the ground with gold." Li Xiulan's third uncle, Chen Benjin, an old man, also did not believe it, but he was afraid that people would say he was conservative, so he did not speak plainly, but said "meaningfully": "Great! This time you can go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao! That would be really glorious!" Li Xiulan and Chen Benxue felt a little angry when they heard these words, but they did not lose heart at all. On the contrary, Li Xiulan encouraged Chen Benxue and said, "You must work hard, don't really mess it up and be laughed at!"

    The land they used for the experiment was sandy soil, with a historical wheat yield of around 300 jin, and the highest last year was 638 jin. Last year, cotton was grown in rotation with wheat, yielding more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In the local area, cotton stubble is traditionally not used for wheat, as it is believed that wheat does not grow well on cotton land. The popular saying is: "Planting wheat on cotton stubble is like a beggar shouting in the street" (meaning there is nothing to eat and you have to beg). "Planting wheat in cotton fields yields no more than a bag of cloth (more than 100 jin)." But Li Xiulan had a different idea: "Cotton stubble is bad, but we have fertilizer, so it doesn't matter. Besides, if we only look for land with good conditions for experiments, how can we convince people?"

    Li Xiulan and Chen Benxue did not have any advanced technical knowledge, but they believed in the Party's call and the advanced experience summarized by the Party. During sowing, they carried out a series of technical reforms despite opposition from conservatives. After pulling out the cotton plants, they carried out three consecutive land preparations, plowing two times lengthwise and one time crosswise, to a depth of 5.5 cun; when plowing the second time, they applied 60 dan of human manure as base fertilizer per mu; when sowing, they also applied 216 dan of 50-year-old wall soil as seed fertilizer per mu. They sowed four days before the Frost's Descent, six or seven days earlier than usual for cotton stubble land, using 28 jin of Nanda 2419 wheat per mu, which had been selected using mud water. The sowing method was wide-row strip planting with a 6-cun sowing width and a 4-cun empty row, and the bottom of the ditch was wide and flat, and the seeds were evenly spread, achieving dense planting and full seedlings. But all of this was opposed by conservatives. For example, in the past, only seven or eight jin of seeds were sown per mu, and the most last year was only 17 or 18 jin. Now it has been increased to 28 jin, and conservatives said again: "How can you hoe the ground with such dense planting?" Li Xiulan and the others were not shaken by these arguments.

    The wheat seedlings emerged, black and growing exceptionally evenly and strongly. At this time, Chen Benxue was transferred away due to the needs of water conservancy construction, leaving only Li Xiulan to persist with the experiment. After the Spring Festival, she went to Gucheng again to visit, and seeing that the wheat seedlings were growing well there, she became even more determined to catch up. However, not long after, due to winter drought and insufficient moisture, the wheat seedlings in the team generally turned yellow. The conservatives raised their heads and complained that "too much was planted," "too dense," and so on. Under these circumstances, the team cadres also wavered and harrowed all the wheat fields once, removing many wheat seedlings, but Li Xiulan insisted on not harrowing, maintaining full seedlings. In addition, she carried out five cultivations and weeding: because the seedlings were too dense, ordinary wheat hoes were not useful, so she used small hoes that she used to hoe radish fields in the past. She also applied fertilizer five times: the first time was 80 dan of liquid manure, the second time was 140 dan of compost, the third time was 60 dan of liquid manure, the fourth time was 100 dan of stable manure, and the fifth time was 30 jin of ammonium sulfate. To eliminate pests, she also used 666 pesticide powder to kill spider mites and aphids twice. As a result, her wheat grew vigorously upwards and was always rated as first-class seedlings.

    From growth to harvest, people who had seen this wheat field, although they all admitted that the wheat was growing well, no one could estimate exactly how much it would yield. Even Li Xiulan and Chen Benxue could not say how much it would produce. Facts speak louder than words, and everyone wanted to see exactly what it would yield at harvest time. After single threshing and weighing, this plot yielded a total of 4383.4 jin, averaging 3622.5 jin per mu. Now that the real wheat is there, what else can be said? Chen Jin, who was the most unconvinced, personally carried the grain into the warehouse during the threshing, carrying 29 cloth bags in a row. He said as he carried: "I really didn't expect it!"

    Recently, many people have visited Li Xiulan, asking her to introduce her experience. This young woman always says: "What experience do I have? I'm just listening to the Party and doing things according to the Party's instructions. Besides, there are still many shortcomings, and I have to work hard!"

    Li Xiulan and Chen Benxue have already conducted a preliminary inspection of the cultivation of the experimental field and found many shortcomings, such as the plowing depth is not deep enough, the seeding amount can be increased further, and the management work is not good enough, etc. If these shortcomings can be overcome, the yield can of course be greatly increased. Now, they plan to conduct a high-yield experiment with a yield of 10,000 jin of wheat per mu in this field next year.

    小麦高产纪录是怎样创造的
    中共光化县委第一书记　郑少波
    湖北省光化县白莲乡永进农业社第五生产队，今年有块小麦长得特别出众。人走进地里，只见人头，看不到人身。而且，整块地的小麦，都是株高秆粗、穗长粒大，没有一点倒伏。快要收割时，有几个妇女到地里随便搓了几个穗子一数，有一穗结麦八十八粒，还有一穗结了八十五粒，最少的也有五十多粒。
    开始收割了。为了弄清这块地究竟产麦多少，指导组（区）和乡里都派了干部来验收，许多社员也自动参加割麦和打场。经过丈量，这块地共有一亩二分一厘。验收结果，共打麦子四千三百八十三斤四两，平均亩产合三千六百二十二斤五两。
    这样的高产成绩的创造者，也是普普通通的劳动人民：永进社的妇联主任、共青团支部委员李秀兰和这个社的技术股长陈本学。李秀兰今年二十五岁，出身贫农家庭，解放后上过四年小学。陈本学至今还是个文盲。
    他们究竟是怎样获得这样高产的呢？要回答这个问题，还需从头谈起。
    去年9月底，李秀兰随着乡支部组织的参观团到谷城县胡岗乡八一农业社学习种小麦的经验。就在那次，她听到一位妇联主任介绍计划亩产小麦千斤的丰产试验，这件事立刻引起了李秀兰的思想斗争：“人家是个妇女，我也是个妇女，她能搞千斤试验，我为什么不能呢？”她又想：“党经常教导我们要刻苦钻研，大胆创造？”经这样一想她的劲头大起来了。就在那次回乡的路上，她和本社技术股长陈本学商量好了：回去后合作搞千斤丰产的试验。
    在队委会上，李秀兰向队委报告了他们的计划。大多数队委都支持他们，鼓励他们说：“你们干吧，肥料不够，队里设法拨！”但也有的队委不相信他们能成功，冷言冷语的说：“行哪！也许能收到吧？”
    李秀兰和陈本学要搞千斤试验的消息传开了。有不少的社员，特别是一些年纪较大的农民，听到这件事后，认为他们是“胡闹”，怎么也不相信能够亩产千斤小麦。有个叫陈德田的社员，听说他们要搞千斤试验后，跑来问李秀兰：“你有没有算算账：一千斤是多少？”没等李秀兰回答，他又说了：“一千斤是三石七斗多粮食；一亩地三石七，一分地就是三斗七，这把地下都要铺黄。”李秀兰的三爹陈本金老汉也不相信，但他怕人家说他保守，没有明讲，而是“话中有话”地说：“好哇！这回可要上北京见毛主席啦！可真是光荣咧！”这些话李秀兰和陈本学听了心里也有些气愤，可是并没有泄一点气。相反，李秀兰还鼓励陈本学说：“可得下劲干，不要真弄垮了，落人笑话！”
    他们用作试验的地是块油沙土，历年小麦产量三百来斤，去年最高收了六百三十八斤。去年和小麦连作的是棉花，每亩收皮棉一百多斤。在当地，棉花茬历来是不种麦的，认为棉花地种麦不长，流行的说法是：“花茬地种麦叫花子喊街”（意思是没有吃的要当乞丐）“棉花地里种小麦，产量不过一布袋（一百多斤）。”但李秀兰却有另外的想法：“花茬口坏，我们有肥料，不碍事。再说，光找条件好的地作试验，咋能说服人呢？”
    李秀兰和陈本学都没有什么高深的技术知识，但是，他们相信党的号召，相信党总结的先进经验。在播种的时候，他们不顾保守思想的反对，进行了一系列的技术改革。拔掉棉株以后，他们就连续进行了三次整地，直犁两道、横犁一道，深度达到五寸半；犁第二道的时候，每亩下底肥人粪尿六十担；播种时每亩又下了五十年的陈墙土二百一十六担，作种肥。他们在霜降前四天播种，比一般棉花茬地早六、七天，每亩下种量是二十八斤，用的是经过泥水选种的南大二四一九小麦。播种方法是播幅六寸，空行四寸的宽幅条播，而且沟底开得宽而又平，抖籽也十分均匀，作到了密植全苗。可是这些都遭到保守派的反对。例如，下种量在以往每亩只下七、八斤，去年最多的也只下到十七、八斤，现在增加到二十八斤，保守派又说话了：“种那么密看咋锄地？”李秀兰他们没有为这些说法动摇。
    麦苗出土了，黑嘟嘟的长得分外整齐、健壮。这时候因为水利工地的需要，陈本学被调走了，只留下李秀兰一人坚持着试验。春节后，她又跑到谷城去参观了一趟，看到那里的麦苗长得好，更增加了往前赶的决心。可是，过了不久，因为冬季干旱，水分不足，队里的麦苗普遍发黄。保守派抬头了，出来纷纷埋怨“种下多了”、“太密了”，等等。在这样情况下，队干部也动摇了，将所有的麦地都耙了一次，耙去不少麦苗，而李秀兰坚持着没有耙，保持了全苗。此外，她还进行了五次中耕锄草，因苗太密了，普通锄麦的锄不好使，她就用往年锄萝卜地的小锄来锄。她还追了五次肥：第一次水粪八十担，第二次堆肥一百四十担，第三次水粪六十担，第四次厩肥一百担，第五次追硫酸铵三十斤。为了消灭虫害，她还先后两次地用六六六药粉药杀红蜘蛛和蚜虫。结果，她的小麦一股劲地往上长，始终都被评为一类苗。
    从生长到丰收，见过这块小麦的人，虽然都承认这块小麦生长良好，可是究竟能收多少，谁也估不透。连李秀兰和陈本学，也说不出能产多少。事实胜于雄辩，到收割时，大家都要看个究竟。经过单打单秤，这块地共收了四千三百八十三斤四两，平均亩产三千六百二十二斤五两。如今实实在在的麦子摆在那里，还有什么说的呢？陈金三本是最不服气的一个，在打场的时候，他亲自把粮食搬进仓去，一连扛了二十九布袋。他边扛边说：“真想不到啊！”
    最近，有不少人前去访问李秀兰，请她介绍经验。这个青年妇女总是说：“我有啥经验呢？我不过是听党的话，按照党的指示去办罢了。再说，缺点还不少，还得好好努力哩！”
    李秀兰已经和陈本学一起对试验地的耕作进行了初步的检查，找出了不少缺点，比如耕的深度还不够，下种量还能再加大，管理工作也不够好，等。如果能克服这些缺点，产量当然还能大大上升。现在，他们打算明年在这块地里，做亩产小麦一万斤的高额丰产试验。
