Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 29th. The Indian "Free Press" published a commentary criticizing US President Eisenhower for evading his promise on holding a summit conference in his recent reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

The newspaper stated that Eisenhower's recent letter to Khrushchev "gives one the impression that Washington would evade its earlier promise at the slightest opportunity." It also wrote, "The only inferences that can be drawn from Washington's new wording are, first, that it considers the idea of holding a top-level meeting to discuss the West Asia problem unwise—note Eisenhower's emphasis on including 'broader issues' on the agenda—and second, that it disapproves of India's participation as a major power and the Arab countries' representation at the meeting."

The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower's proposal to include "broader issues" on the meeting agenda was aimed at diverting attention from the main issue—the US aggression in West Asia. The newspaper said that Eisenhower's argument "is hardly convincing, especially given the widely known fact that Washington was unwilling to attend a top-level meeting before the West Asia crisis."

The "Bombay Chronicle" commented: "The letter of the law has killed its spirit; from the Soviet point of view of urgency, a top-level meeting in the United Nations is at least suffocated to death."

The newspaper said: "This is a well-known trick that the whole world has been familiar with since the Lancaster House discussions on disarmament."

It said: "It is now clear that the major powers have left the important issue of West Asia behind; their aim may be to gain by delay."

### 艾森豪威尔规避自己诺言  印度舆论指责美国对首脑会议的态度

    艾森豪威尔规避自己诺言
    印度舆论指责美国对首脑会议的态度
    新华社新德里29日电　印度“自由新闻”发表评论，指责美国总统艾森豪威尔在最近写给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的复信中，在举行政府首脑会议问题上规避自己的诺言。
    这家报纸说，艾森豪威尔最近给赫鲁晓夫的信件“使人们觉得，只要有一半机会，华盛顿就会规避早些时候的诺言”。它还写道，“可以从华盛顿的新措词中得到的推论只能是，第一，它认为举行讨论西亚问题的最高级会议的想法是不聪明的——请注意艾森豪威尔强调在议程上包括‘更广泛的问题’——第二，让印度作为大国参加会议和让阿拉伯国家派代表参加会议是它所不赞成的”。
    这家报纸指出，艾森豪威尔提出要在会议议程上包括“更广泛的问题”，其目的是想分散对主要问题——美国侵略西亚的注意力。报纸说，艾森豪威尔的这个主张“是很难令人信服的，特别是鉴于大家都知道华盛顿在西亚危机之前不愿意参加最高级会议”。
    “孟买纪事报”发表评论说：“法律的文字已经扼杀了它的精神；从苏联的迫切性观点来看，联合国中的最高级会议至少是窒息而死了。”
    这家报纸说：“自从兰开斯特大厦讨论裁军问题以来，这是全世界早已熟知的伎俩。”
    它说：“现在很明显，大国已经把西亚这一重要问题抛在脑后；它们的目的或许是用拖延来取胜。”
