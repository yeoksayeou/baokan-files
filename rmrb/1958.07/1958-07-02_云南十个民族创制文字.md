Yunnan Province's minority language work, under the radiant illumination of the General Line, has achieved great success. After several years of effort, it has assisted in the creation and improvement of fourteen written languages for ten ethnic groups, including two Dai languages (Xishuangbanna Dai and Dehong Dai Le), two Jingpo languages (Jingpo branch and Zaiwa branch), two Miao languages (Zhaotong and Wenshan), two Hani languages (Haya and Bika), and one each for Kawa, Lisu, Lahu, Naxi, Zhuang, and Liangshan Yi. Except for the Hani, Naxi, and Zhuang scripts, the written languages of the other ethnic groups have been experimentally promoted and used in literacy campaigns in ethnic regions. Ethnic languages have also been used in autonomous organs and ethnic schools.
