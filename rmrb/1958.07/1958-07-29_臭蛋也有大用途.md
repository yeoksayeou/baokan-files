Rotten Eggs Also Have Great Uses

    The Beijing Food Company handles 12 million jin of fresh eggs every year. Most of these fresh eggs come from Henan, Hubei, Shandong, Hebei and other places. June, July, and August are the peak season for egg production, but due to the hot weather, some fresh eggs deteriorate during the acquisition and long-distance transportation. Some of the egg whites and yolks turn black and smell very bad, making them inedible. These are commonly known as rotten eggs. The annual amount of such rotten eggs is about 150,000 to 200,000 jin, most of which were discarded in the past, and some were treated as manure. With the technical revolution and the great leap forward in work, the workers discovered that the yolks of rotten eggs contain oil and can be refined into oil. After a few days of research, they finally succeeded in the trial refining. Every 400 jin of rotten eggs can produce 50 jin of oil. This oil can be used to make soap, and the residue after oil extraction can also be used to make monosodium glutamate. (Zhang Ziqi)

    臭蛋也有大用途
    北京市食品公司，每年经营鲜蛋达一二千万斤，这些鲜蛋，大部分来自河南、湖北、山东、河北等地，每年6、7、8月间，是鸡蛋生产的旺季，可是由于天气炎热，经过收购和长途运输，部分鲜蛋变质，有的蛋白和蛋黄都变成黑色，臭味很大，不能食用，俗称臭蛋。这样的臭蛋全年约有十五万到二十万斤，过去大部分是扔掉，有的当作粪肥处理。随着技术革命和工作的跃进，职工们发现臭蛋的蛋黄，含有油分，可以炼油。经过几天的研究，终于试炼成功。每四百斤臭蛋，可以出油五十斤。这种油可制肥皂，炼油后的渣子，还可以制味之素。　　　（张子奇）
