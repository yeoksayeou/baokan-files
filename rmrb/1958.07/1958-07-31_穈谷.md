Foxtail millet is a general term for glutinous millet and common millet. In some regions, foxtail millet is called "mizi." Foxtail millet generally comes in two types: soft and hard. The soft type (i.e., glutinous millet) is sticky, while the hard type (i.e., common millet) is similar to small yellow millet. The foxtail millet plant is similar to the millet plant, but the ears are sparse, and the grains are slightly larger than millet.

In this news item, "millet" refers to粟 (sù, foxtail millet), not稻谷 (dàogǔ, rice). Foxtail millet that has been milled and skinned becomes小米 (xiǎomǐ, small yellow millet).

专栏：名词解释

    穈谷
    穈就是黍稷，有些地区叫穈子为糜子。穈子一般分软、硬两种，软的（即黍）有糯性，硬的（即稷）似小米。穈子植株似谷，但穗疏散，籽粒比谷略大。
    这条消息里的谷是粟，不是稻谷。谷子经过碾制去皮就是小米。
