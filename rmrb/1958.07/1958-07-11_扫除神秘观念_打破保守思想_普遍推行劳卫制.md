Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Eliminating mystical concepts, breaking conservative thinking, and universally and rapidly promoting the Labor-Defense System, striving to have hundreds of millions of people pass the Labor-Defense System within a few years, so that our people can achieve a great leap forward in health conditions – this is the unanimous opinion reached at the Labor-Defense System scientific discussion meeting recently convened by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

Participants in this discussion meeting included cadres from the sports commissions of various provinces and cities, physical education teachers from universities and middle schools, and representatives from agricultural production cooperatives, factories, mines, and other grassroots units with significant achievements in promoting the Labor-Defense System were also invited to participate.

The meeting first affirmed that the Labor-Defense System is an advanced and scientific sports system. Great achievements have been made in promoting the Labor-Defense System over the past few years. By the end of 1957, more than 1.73 million people nationwide (excluding the military) had reached the standards of various levels of the Labor-Defense System, which has played a positive role in enhancing the physique of our people and improving sports technical levels. The current Labor-Defense System project standards are basically in line with China's actual conditions and are welcomed by the broad masses.

However, judging from the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the situation of a great leap forward in sports, the development of the Labor-Defense System appears to be slow. The main reasons for this slowness are the mystical concepts and conservative thinking of leaders regarding the development of the Labor-Defense System.

In the past, dogmatism was quite serious in the publicity and research work of the Labor-Defense System. There was blind faith in books and a small number of experts, and many terms and expressions were rigidly used, which made many people daunted by the Labor-Defense System. In fact, the Labor-Defense System itself is not mysterious or complicated at all. It only stipulates several common sports projects that can exercise the human body's speed, endurance, agility, and strength, such as running, jumping, throwing, and weightlifting, according to the requirements of comprehensive development according to physical needs. Different standards are set for different genders and ages to encourage the masses to persist in physical exercise regularly. It is a basic requirement put forward by the state for the people in sports exercise.

In the past, because of the mystical concepts of the Labor-Defense System, the conservative thinking in the promotion was aggravated. To promote it, there must be a large pile of "conditions", otherwise it cannot be promoted. Schools dare not let go and do it, and there are many restrictive rules; they dare not carry out a large number of them among employees; in rural areas, they dare not even think about doing the Labor-Defense System. Therefore, the development speed of the Labor-Defense System has been greatly affected.

At this discussion meeting, many grassroots units used vivid examples to powerfully criticize mystical concepts, "condition theory," and conservative thinking.

The Longtan Agricultural Cooperative in Beipiao County, Liaoning Province, is a mountainous cooperative with "nine gullies and eighteen branches, and every branch has people living there." The sports foundation is very poor, and the conditions are very difficult. However, in the short few months of this year, the Labor-Defense System has been carried out, and 280 farmers have reached the standard, becoming the first red flag in the promotion of the Labor-Defense System in rural China. In addition to combining sports and production into one rope and fully relying on the masses, they popularized the Labor-Defense System in layman's terms. The Shanghai Huangpu District Medical and Sports Association has more than 400 employees scattered in 48 shops; the Baoding City People's Bank has more than 200 employees scattered in 28 units. They have very little space, but more than 20% of the employees in these two units have reached the Labor-Defense System standards. In the past, due to restrictive rules, only 22% of the total number of students in secondary schools and above reached the standard in more than four years. After the Great Leap Forward this year, many schools have reached 70%-80%, or even more than 90% within a few months.

The meeting believes that as long as we break superstitions, break conservative thinking, give prominence to politics, mobilize and rely on the masses, the Labor-Defense System can and should be actively promoted in schools, factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, troops and rural areas. So that people from all walks of life, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, can improve their health and better serve the building of socialism.

### 扫除神秘观念　打破保守思想  普遍推行劳卫制

    扫除神秘观念　打破保守思想
    普遍推行劳卫制
    新华社10日讯　破除神秘观念，打破保守思想，普遍迅速地开展劳卫制，争取在几年内有成亿人民通过劳卫制，使我国人民在健康状况上来个大跃进，这是国家体委最近召开的劳卫制科学讨论会所得出的一致意见。
    参加这次讨论会的有各省、市体委干部和大、中学校的体育教师，并邀请了一部分在推行劳卫制工作上有显著成绩的农业生产合作社和厂矿、企业等基层单位的代表参加。
    会议首先肯定了劳卫制是一种先进的、科学的体育制度，几年来推行劳卫制的成绩很大，到1957年底，全国已有一百七十三万多人（不包括部队）达到劳卫制各级标准，这对增强我国人民的体质和提高运动技术水平都起了积极作用。现行的劳卫制项目标准，基本上切合我国实际情况，是受到广大群众欢迎的。
    但是，根据鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和体育运动大跃进的形势来看，劳卫制的开展就显得缓慢。造成这种缓慢的原因，主要是领导思想上对开展劳卫制的神秘观念和保守思想。
    过去在劳卫制的宣传和研究工作中，教条主义相当严重，迷信书本，迷信少数专家，生硬搬用了许多名词术语，使不少人对劳卫制望而生畏。其实，劳卫制本身一点也不神秘、不复杂，它只是根据身体需要全面发展的要求，规定出几个能够锻炼人体的速度、耐力、灵敏和力量的通行的运动项目，如跑、跳、投掷、举重等，按不同性别、不同年龄订出不同的标准，鼓舞群众经常坚持体育锻炼。它是国家对人民在体育锻炼上提出的一个基本要求。
    过去，因为对劳卫制有神秘观念，所以就加重了推行中的保守思想，要推行就得有一大堆“条件”，不然就不能推行。学校中不敢放手搞，有不少清规戒律；在职工中不敢大量开展；农村中更不敢设想搞劳卫制，因此，大大影响了劳卫制的发展速度。
    在这次讨论会上，许多基层单位用生动的事例，有力地批判了神秘观念、“条件论”和保守思想。
    辽宁省北票县龙潭农业社是一个“九沟十八岔，岔岔有人家”的山区社，体育基础很差，条件很困难，而在今年短短的几个月中开展了劳卫制，有二百八十个农民达到标准，成为我国农村推行劳卫制的第一面红旗。除了他们把体育和生产拧成一股绳，充分依靠群众以外，他们通俗地宣传了劳卫制。上海黄浦区医药体协四百多职工分散在四十八个店铺；保定市人民银行二百多职工分散在二十八个单位。他们的场地很少，但这两个单位已有20％以上的职工达到劳卫制标准。过去，学校推行劳卫制由于清规戒律，四年多达到标准的只占中等以上学校学生总数的22％，今年大跃进以后，许多学校在几个月内就达到了70％—80％，甚至90％以上。
    会议认为，只要破除迷信，打破保守思想，政治挂帅，发动和依靠群众，劳卫制在学校、厂矿、企业、机关、部队和农村中都可以，也应当积极推行。使工、农、兵、学、商各行各业的人们都能练好身体，更好地为建设社会主义服务。
